WEBVTT

00:06.367 --> 00:07.793
Previously on "Graves"...

00:07.794 --> 00:11.366
There is a line, sir, that you
cannot expect me to cross.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.366
- Peyote.
- What?!

00:13.367 --> 00:15.366
This is false imprisonment
of a member of the cabinet.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.627
- Trust me.
- What is this?

00:17.628 --> 00:19.967
You make that so hard, sir.

00:19.968 --> 00:21.734
You are what I want.

00:21.735 --> 00:24.593
- So you'd vote for me?
- I'd bet my fortune on you.

00:24.654 --> 00:26.112
Okay. Oh, I can't.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.653
This guy's a monster.
His mother shouldn't die

00:28.654 --> 00:31.126
thinking that what he did
was in any way her fault.

00:31.127 --> 00:33.634
I can never be with you.
Someone like you.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.653
Fuck you.

00:34.654 --> 00:37.509
Have Lawrence call Martin Bashir

00:37.510 --> 00:39.653
to do a profile piece for "America 360."

00:39.654 --> 00:43.488
This train has got to leave
the station and I'm driving.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.653
Tonight, on "America 360"...

00:48.654 --> 00:50.653
In what should be his twilight,

00:50.654 --> 00:55.266
a former president, arguably
one of history's most polarizing leaders,

00:55.267 --> 00:58.653
is doing anything but going
gently into that good night.

00:58.654 --> 01:02.653
It was me who gutted cancer research.

01:02.654 --> 01:06.653
Take my goddamn name off this road.

01:06.654 --> 01:08.653
How would Washington feel?

01:08.654 --> 01:11.653
He'd blow his brains out.

01:11.654 --> 01:16.184
It's been decades since Richard,
Margaret, Olivia, and Jeremy Graves

01:16.185 --> 01:19.653
were residents
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

01:19.654 --> 01:21.398
Over the next 30 minutes,

01:21.399 --> 01:23.124
with the family as our guide,

01:23.125 --> 01:25.653
we'll journey back to relive it all.

01:25.654 --> 01:27.653
The ranch hand from New Mexico

01:27.654 --> 01:29.653
who became commander-in-chief.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.653
His ever devoted wife Margaret

01:31.654 --> 01:34.653
as rumors swirl
that the former first lady

01:34.654 --> 01:36.653
will make her own political mark.

01:36.654 --> 01:39.653
A daughter, the poster-perfect icon

01:39.654 --> 01:42.056
that American girls aspired to be

01:42.057 --> 01:44.653
just as her fairy tale unravels.

01:44.654 --> 01:47.220
And the precocious daredevil little boy,

01:47.221 --> 01:50.653
once witness to his father's
attempted assassination,

01:50.654 --> 01:53.653
now a recently returned war hero.

01:53.654 --> 01:55.653
I got to do what I got to do, you know?

01:55.654 --> 01:57.653
First Family Graves then

01:57.654 --> 01:59.653
and now.

01:59.654 --> 02:04.653
I'm Martin Bashir
and this is "America 360."

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:55.654 --> 02:57.653
I'm somewhere. Leave it here.

02:57.654 --> 03:00.318
Hey, Sammy, it's me.

03:00.319 --> 03:02.653
Look, you can't keep avoiding me.

03:02.654 --> 03:05.847
I know I screwed up
and I won't blame the peyote,

03:05.848 --> 03:08.653
but it was the peyote.

03:08.654 --> 03:11.653
So please, please, please call me back.

03:11.654 --> 03:14.653
Let me explain, okay?

03:14.654 --> 03:16.653
Hey, Isaiah.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.653
Oh, good morning, Jeremy.

03:17.654 --> 03:20.653
Good to see you, man. Really good.

03:20.654 --> 03:23.653
- It is?
- Come on, always, buddy.

03:23.654 --> 03:25.653
Where have you been
the past couple of days?

03:25.654 --> 03:27.653
Oh, I went to Martin Treadwell's
furlough hearing.

03:27.654 --> 03:29.653
You did what?

03:29.654 --> 03:32.355
What? Why... why would you do that?

03:32.356 --> 03:34.653
Why not? That guy sent me a letter.

03:34.654 --> 03:37.653
He wanted to talk to me.
Honestly, it was a no-brainer.

03:37.654 --> 03:40.653
That guy's been living
under my bed for way too long.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.072
So I agreed to meet with him.

03:44.073 --> 03:45.653
I mean, at first I was
gonna tell him to shove

03:45.654 --> 03:48.146
that weekend furlough
up his jail violated ass,

03:48.147 --> 03:51.018
but, you know, I felt bad for the guy.

03:51.019 --> 03:53.653
Me, something bordering on compassion.

03:53.654 --> 03:55.653
What did your father say about it?

03:55.654 --> 03:57.653
- I haven't told him.
- What?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.653
Don't you think that you should?

03:59.654 --> 04:02.653
I mean, you kind of have to, Jeremy.

04:02.654 --> 04:05.017
For once I didn't do something
for Richard Graves.

04:05.018 --> 04:07.129
I did it for me and it felt great.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.653
You can tell him if you want.
I don't give a shit.

04:09.654 --> 04:12.654
Oh, sidebar, come here.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.653
I met this amazing girl.

04:15.654 --> 04:18.188
I mean, yeah, she's the daughter
of a serial killer,

04:18.189 --> 04:19.653
but whatever, I'm
the son of a president.

04:19.654 --> 04:21.653
You know, tomato, tomah-to.

04:21.654 --> 04:24.075
Serial killer?

04:24.076 --> 04:25.653
What?

04:25.654 --> 04:27.653
- Isaiah!
- Yes, sir.

04:27.654 --> 04:29.653
Office now.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.653
Yes, sir.

04:32.086 --> 04:33.653
Jesus.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.065
Uh, so, big guy, we have an hour

04:37.066 --> 04:38.653
before Martin Bashir lands.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.324
He's a good friend.

04:40.325 --> 04:42.958
We take hot yoga together.
He's remarkably flexible.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.958
Anyway, he bent over
backwards, literally,

04:45.959 --> 04:49.958
to do this for me today,
so you be nice, okay?

04:49.959 --> 04:53.367
All right, first, regarding your recent

04:53.368 --> 04:55.408
let's just call it adventures.

04:55.409 --> 04:57.958
I crafted a list
of appropriate responses

04:57.959 --> 05:00.958
that I think should cover anything
that Martin throws at you.

05:00.959 --> 05:04.959
It's big, bold fonts and cute, pretty,
little tabs the way you like it, boss.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.518
Just remember,
this is really for Margaret.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.958
Reintroducing you and her to the public

05:10.959 --> 05:12.958
in a positive, stable light.

05:12.959 --> 05:16.958
Yeah, got it. I get it.
I know this game.

05:16.959 --> 05:19.958
I made up the rules. You remember?

05:19.959 --> 05:22.576
- Yeah.
- You did.

05:22.577 --> 05:23.958
Now get the hell out of here.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.958
Oh. Oh.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.958
- Okay. Good talk.
- Yeah.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.959
Yeah.

05:34.959 --> 05:35.958
- Oh, man.
- Sir?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.961
I can't do this.

05:38.625 --> 05:42.625
I can't do this prime-time puppet show.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.585
I can't be that...

05:47.959 --> 05:49.958
anymore.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.958
I know. I know, sir,
but it's just one day.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.653
It's a few hours.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.958
It'll be easy to be that folksy icon

05:56.959 --> 05:59.958
that we all remember, that I remember.

05:59.959 --> 06:03.958
And besides, you sort of
have to do this, sir,

06:03.959 --> 06:05.534
for Mrs. Graves.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.958
You little shit.

06:10.959 --> 06:12.958
Who do you work for?

06:12.959 --> 06:14.958
Oh, you. Of course, you.

06:14.959 --> 06:18.958
Why are you telling me
what Mrs. Graves needs?

06:18.959 --> 06:21.958
What about what I need, Isaiah?

06:21.959 --> 06:23.958
That's all I care about, sir.

06:23.959 --> 06:27.958
No, I was just saying
that today's just a little different.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.474
You know, Isaiah, I have tested you,

06:30.475 --> 06:31.958
tested you, and tested you

06:31.959 --> 06:35.475
and you've shown me
that I can trust you.

06:35.636 --> 06:39.635
So please don't push me anymore today.

06:39.636 --> 06:42.006
- You can trust me, sir.
- Don't bother me.

06:42.007 --> 06:43.636
What the hell was...

06:46.367 --> 06:47.635
that?

06:47.636 --> 06:49.635
It's important this "360" piece
go off without a hitch.

06:49.636 --> 06:53.206
It's a reset. Lord knows this
family could use a reset.

06:53.231 --> 06:54.635
I'm gonna need it.

06:54.636 --> 06:57.065
We also have to talk money, Maggie.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.635
- Not today.
- Yes, Maggie, today.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.040
You know the Bashir expose
is, among other things,

07:02.041 --> 07:04.635
designed to whet donors' appetites
to loosen up some wallets.

07:04.636 --> 07:07.635
Please don't say it like that.
I hate this part.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.161
It's like one murky tick
above prostitution.

07:10.186 --> 07:11.979
Excuse me.

07:11.980 --> 07:14.016
Olivia.

07:14.636 --> 07:15.991
Your hair, it's back.

07:15.992 --> 07:19.130
It looks wonderful, sweetheart.
Thank you.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.635
Yep, six hours in a salon
just for you, Mother,

07:21.636 --> 07:23.095
and your little dog and pony show.

07:23.096 --> 07:24.892
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:26.042 --> 07:28.042
Mrs. Graves, we need you.

07:30.224 --> 07:32.635
Martin Treadwell, the would-be assassin

07:32.636 --> 07:33.990
of former President Richard Graves,

07:33.991 --> 07:36.087
has been granted a weekend furlough

07:36.088 --> 07:38.635
in order to visit his dying mother.

07:38.636 --> 07:40.861
I know you hate this,
but he'll be back inside

07:40.862 --> 07:42.635
before you even know he was out.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.218
It's just a weekend furlough.

07:44.219 --> 07:47.635
It was also just an assassination
attempt on the president.

07:47.636 --> 07:48.966
Okay, enough of that.

07:48.967 --> 07:52.635
I never thought that
I'd live to see the day

07:52.636 --> 07:55.109
he'd get out.

07:55.636 --> 07:58.370
It's just for a weekend.
It's not a big deal.

07:58.371 --> 08:02.128
No big deal? The guy just
tried to kill me, that's all.

08:02.129 --> 08:04.635
He's going to visit his dying
mother, right, Isaiah?

08:04.636 --> 08:06.635
What? I don't know anything about that.

08:06.636 --> 08:08.635
Okay, everyone just calm down.

08:08.636 --> 08:11.635
Take a deep breath.
It's all in the past.

08:12.018 --> 08:15.635
We're not gonna let this derail us.
Not today, understood?

08:15.636 --> 08:17.050
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

08:17.051 --> 08:21.036
On a typical day at his vast
compound in Santa Fe,

08:21.037 --> 08:23.296
known as the New Mexico White House,

08:23.297 --> 08:26.635
this is what the still active
Richard Graves

08:26.636 --> 08:28.262
considers cardio.

08:30.261 --> 08:33.635
The only child born
to a poor ranch family,

08:33.635 --> 08:36.958
Richard Graves always
had a style all his own.

08:37.073 --> 08:40.635
After cancer claimed his mother
before his sixth birthday,

08:40.635 --> 08:43.635
the future president
was raised by his father

08:43.635 --> 08:46.635
and the ranch hands
he considered family.

08:47.055 --> 08:49.635
He was self-made from day one.

08:49.636 --> 08:52.635
His political rise, meteoric.

08:52.636 --> 08:55.635
You've been making
a bit of noise lately.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.980
You've been called reckless,
dangerous even.

08:58.981 --> 09:02.635
Well, noise is life for me, Martin.

09:02.636 --> 09:07.635
It keeps you engaged, and at my age
you have to stay engaged.

09:07.636 --> 09:09.635
You have to move.
You have to keep active.

09:09.636 --> 09:14.287
So I feel good.
Happier than a gopher in soft dirt.

09:15.636 --> 09:18.635
That was one of my father's sayings.

09:18.636 --> 09:20.635
And we're out.

09:20.636 --> 09:23.635
- Thanks, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

09:23.636 --> 09:26.635
So how was that?

09:26.636 --> 09:30.636
Was that folksy enough? Iconic enough?

09:31.636 --> 09:33.635
Felt like waterboarding.

09:33.636 --> 09:35.635
- Huh?
- Huh?

09:35.636 --> 09:38.635
Um, yes, sir. It was...

09:38.636 --> 09:41.635
you know, actually,
I didn't catch it at all.

09:41.636 --> 09:44.230
Just what the hell is wrong with you?

09:44.255 --> 09:47.635
Nothing, sir. It's just...

09:47.636 --> 09:49.169
Sammy's mad at me.

09:49.194 --> 09:52.143
You and Sammy?

09:52.144 --> 09:53.635
Yeah, we're kind of a thing.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.635
I mean, not anymore in a way.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.215
I don't... it's complicated.

09:57.216 --> 10:00.635
Oh, Sammy would never.
You're too straight.

10:00.636 --> 10:04.635
She's way out of your league.

10:04.636 --> 10:06.636
It would never work.

10:10.636 --> 10:12.148
- Isaiah, right?
- Yeah.

10:12.149 --> 10:13.635
The family segment is up next.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.705
We need Olivia in hair and makeup.

10:16.636 --> 10:17.635
Okay.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.635
Olivia?

10:23.636 --> 10:24.635
Oh, sorry.

10:24.636 --> 10:28.635
Hey. Hey.

10:28.636 --> 10:30.635
Are you okay?

10:30.636 --> 10:31.635
Do I look okay?

10:32.529 --> 10:34.635
Well, no. I was just...

10:34.636 --> 10:36.635
No, don't come any closer.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.635
- Just sit down. Sit.
- Yes.

10:39.636 --> 10:42.635
- Sit. Sit faster.
- Fine, I'm sitting. I'm sitting.

10:42.636 --> 10:46.216
I just don't feel very
approachable right now, okay?

10:46.217 --> 10:47.743
Okay.

10:49.175 --> 10:51.636
Can I at least ask what's wrong?

10:54.191 --> 10:55.636
Oh!

10:57.268 --> 10:59.268
Oh, boy.

11:01.482 --> 11:03.482
Are you sure?

11:06.636 --> 11:08.635
You are sure.

11:08.636 --> 11:10.748
And very thorough.

11:13.636 --> 11:14.635
God.

11:14.636 --> 11:16.038
Don't you fucking dare

11:16.039 --> 11:18.076
tell my mother, my father, anyone.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.409
This is between you and me,
do you understand?

11:22.636 --> 11:24.873
Because my baby's daddy

11:25.636 --> 11:26.635
will kill you.

11:27.227 --> 11:28.635
What?

11:28.636 --> 11:30.635
Growing up Graves.

11:31.033 --> 11:35.093
You two grew up under
something of a microscope

11:35.094 --> 11:36.933
that really wasn't of your choosing.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.019
You know, Martin, it didn't
feel like that, really.

11:40.044 --> 11:43.259
Yeah, my brother and I, we were lucky.

11:43.284 --> 11:46.635
We didn't grow up in a reality
where paparazzi chased us.

11:46.636 --> 11:50.233
And we didn't have to deal
with one of these faceless monsters

11:50.234 --> 11:53.177
behind a computer writing nasty things.

11:53.217 --> 11:57.277
Which, of course, brings us to the recent
dissolution of your marriage.

11:57.278 --> 12:01.111
Now, by all accounts,
you had the fairy tale,

12:01.112 --> 12:02.635
so what happened?

12:02.636 --> 12:04.635
Well, the truth is, Martin,

12:04.995 --> 12:07.525
I didn't have the fairy tale.

12:07.526 --> 12:11.635
William and I, we were young
and very much in love once,

12:11.636 --> 12:16.635
but I grew up seeing
what a marriage can be,

12:16.636 --> 12:18.635
you know, what it should be.

12:18.636 --> 12:23.636
And I'm not gonna rest until I find it.

12:27.294 --> 12:29.848
That was really weird.
I mean, it was hard.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.848
There I am telling people that I'm
not gonna stop until I find it.

12:32.849 --> 12:34.848
I already have it.

12:34.849 --> 12:37.392
We're not talking
about that right now, Olivia.

12:37.393 --> 12:40.848
His name, Mother, is Arturo.

12:40.849 --> 12:43.315
- Arturo?
- I said not now, please. Not today.

12:43.316 --> 12:44.848
Oh, I see. You're in that Southern

12:44.849 --> 12:46.848
pretend it's not happening,
fuck it place.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.848
Ladies, ladies,
what are we talking about here?

12:49.849 --> 12:50.848
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

12:50.849 --> 12:52.848
You love me no matter what, right?

12:52.849 --> 12:55.118
Oh, of course, sweetheart. Who's Arturo?

12:55.119 --> 12:56.848
Okay, he's this really nice guy...

12:56.849 --> 13:00.848
He's a Mexican drug dealer
our daughter is fucking. There, happy?

13:00.849 --> 13:03.378
He's a drug dealer,
but not in a bad way.

13:03.379 --> 13:06.397
She met him on our property when you
took your stand against deportation.

13:06.398 --> 13:08.848
And as fate would have it, he got
to stay here in this country

13:08.849 --> 13:11.848
because you made sure he had
temporary legal status.

13:11.849 --> 13:15.849
So everybody wins.
She thinks she's in love.

13:20.186 --> 13:22.185
Mags, why wasn't I told about this?

13:22.186 --> 13:26.185
I'm sorry, did I miss our scheduled
debriefing, Mr. President?

13:26.186 --> 13:28.185
I asked for one thing...

13:28.186 --> 13:32.185
that our family be normal
and happy for one day.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.186
One fucking day.

13:36.186 --> 13:37.185
Yeah, yeah.

13:43.674 --> 13:45.185
I can't talk now, Jonathan.

13:45.186 --> 13:47.185
No, it'll only take a second.

13:47.186 --> 13:48.356
It's important.

13:49.186 --> 13:51.133
I can't talk now.

13:52.186 --> 13:55.644
Margaret Lynn Davis
married Richard August Graves

13:55.645 --> 13:58.185
in a small ceremony
on his ranch in Gallup.

13:58.186 --> 14:01.185
He was a rising star
running for governor,

14:01.186 --> 14:04.185
she a secretary answering phones

14:04.186 --> 14:06.185
at his campaign office.

14:06.186 --> 14:09.185
So was it some kind of office romance?

14:09.186 --> 14:13.185
Don't get your honey where you get
your money, my mama always taught me.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.185
No.

14:15.186 --> 14:18.185
Oh, she wouldn't give me
the time of day.

14:18.186 --> 14:22.185
And then one week later,
she came in and she quit.

14:22.186 --> 14:24.575
She quit? Why?

14:24.600 --> 14:27.185
To get my money somewhere else.

14:27.186 --> 14:29.185
Don't worry.

14:29.186 --> 14:33.185
He came and found me
just like I knew he would.

14:35.186 --> 14:38.186
She's been at his side ever since.

14:44.186 --> 14:46.185
- Ow! What?
- Okay, new plan, all right?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.637
You're gonna keep your mouth
shut about Treadwell.

14:48.662 --> 14:50.714
I know I told you I didn't give
a shit if you told my dad,

14:50.739 --> 14:53.185
but, I mean, you saw his reaction,
that fear in his face.

14:53.186 --> 14:56.765
He can't ever know, okay? So it needs
to stay between us, you got it?

14:56.766 --> 14:59.273
Gonna be our little secret, okay?
Understand?

14:59.298 --> 15:00.185
Okay.

15:00.186 --> 15:03.186
There we go. Give me one second, okay?

15:04.739 --> 15:05.739
No, wait there.

15:08.186 --> 15:10.185
Okay, I got to go. Family stuff, okay?

15:10.186 --> 15:12.185
But I'm glad we talked.
Don't tell my father

15:12.186 --> 15:14.185
or I'm gonna fucking rip out
your spleen, okay?

15:14.186 --> 15:17.186
- Good seeing you, buddy. Good talk.
- Thank you.

15:19.639 --> 15:22.639
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

15:33.186 --> 15:37.186
We haven't been in here since you
roofied Meghan McCain on her sweet 16.

15:38.186 --> 15:40.186
She was no fun at all.

15:42.186 --> 15:44.185
- Man, today sucks.
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.186 --> 15:47.186
Faking happy is exhausting.

15:47.752 --> 15:48.752
Mmm.

15:50.819 --> 15:51.819
No.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.630
So you're knocked up?

15:56.186 --> 15:57.678
How'd you know that?

15:58.993 --> 15:59.992
I look fat.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.065
You don't look fat, you just...

16:02.186 --> 16:05.186
you haven't turned down a smoke
since you got your first period.

16:08.186 --> 16:10.186
The drug dealer?

16:11.326 --> 16:12.325
Oh.

16:13.475 --> 16:15.185
Does he know?

16:15.186 --> 16:16.457
No.

16:16.719 --> 16:17.719
Mom and Dad?

16:22.186 --> 16:24.185
Why do we give a shit what they think?

16:24.186 --> 16:26.185
You know what?

16:26.186 --> 16:29.186
Whatever you want,
that's what I want, okay?

16:30.816 --> 16:32.508
I'm not emotionally equipped

16:32.509 --> 16:35.186
to deal with literally anything.

16:36.812 --> 16:38.812
Yeah.

16:41.095 --> 16:43.185
Maggie Lynn Davis was the only child

16:43.186 --> 16:46.185
of a single mother
from Galveston, Texas.

16:46.186 --> 16:50.185
Perhaps it was her humble beginnings
that made Margaret Graves

16:50.186 --> 16:53.689
the most beloved first lady
since Jackie Kennedy.

16:53.690 --> 16:56.185
She was a young mother
in the White House.

16:56.186 --> 16:58.185
Relatable, real.

16:58.186 --> 17:01.185
You've always had
strong personal opinions

17:01.186 --> 17:04.440
and yet you stood behind
the former president

17:04.673 --> 17:07.672
even on decisions that were not popular.

17:07.846 --> 17:11.845
A patriot is someone
whose ruling passion

17:11.869 --> 17:13.868
is the love for his country.

17:14.185 --> 17:18.185
That's who Richard Graves was
and continues to be.

17:18.185 --> 17:21.185
And it is who I will continue to be.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.185
Well, let's cut to the rumors.

17:23.185 --> 17:25.185
Are you running for Senate?

17:26.632 --> 17:29.631
I'm talking to people, Martin,
asking questions.

17:29.733 --> 17:31.732
There's always more you can do
for your country.

17:35.186 --> 17:37.699
Olivia. My God, mi amor.

17:37.745 --> 17:39.638
No, no, no, no, no.

17:39.663 --> 17:42.662
No mi amor. Not yet.

17:43.186 --> 17:46.185
Here's the deal if we're gonna be
together, which is what I want.

17:46.186 --> 17:47.780
I need you to tell me the truth.

17:48.019 --> 17:51.018
So let me have it. All of it.

18:09.953 --> 18:12.952
This is my cousin Chuy.
My father's sister's son.

18:12.953 --> 18:15.952
I was going to introduce
you the other day.

18:16.466 --> 18:17.953
Hi, Chuy.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.953
Ahem.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.645
Oh.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.669
Hi there. It's nice.

18:29.694 --> 18:31.693
Hi. I'm Olivia.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.818
Nice to meet you. Hi.

18:33.843 --> 18:35.842
Great job. Really nice.

18:35.953 --> 18:39.952
Really solid stacks... stacking.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.208
You all right?

18:43.209 --> 18:46.952
Mm-hmm, I just need a minute
to, you know, process.

18:46.953 --> 18:48.594
- I love you.
- That's not helpful.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.952
Okay, great. Seen what I need to see.

18:51.953 --> 18:53.953
Just... I respect the hustle.

19:05.450 --> 19:07.952
So I think I really need to tell you

19:07.953 --> 19:10.823
that I've really fallen for you.

19:11.953 --> 19:14.952
I mean, you're sweet and you're kind

19:14.953 --> 19:17.952
and all you do is smile

19:17.953 --> 19:19.952
when I'm simultaneously
eating and ranting

19:19.953 --> 19:23.342
about some bullshit that you
couldn't possibly care about.

19:23.343 --> 19:24.952
I mean, we barely know each other

19:24.953 --> 19:27.952
and yet you make me feel more like me

19:27.953 --> 19:31.347
than I've ever felt
in my entire life ever.

19:31.372 --> 19:34.952
And guess what. I like her.

19:34.953 --> 19:35.953
That's new.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.790
This...

19:40.199 --> 19:42.953
I want this to work...

19:44.392 --> 19:46.952
but this isn't how I do family.

19:46.953 --> 19:50.354
Uh, family?

19:51.953 --> 19:53.953
I'm pregnant.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.952
Chuy.

20:05.953 --> 20:09.421
Pack everything and call Juarez.

20:09.449 --> 20:10.735
Tell them I'm out.

20:10.953 --> 20:11.953
I'm out.

20:15.727 --> 20:17.952
I didn't think old Banshee
would remember me,

20:17.953 --> 20:21.482
but when I got back,
it was like I never left.

20:21.507 --> 20:24.952
There was something about
this kid and animals.

20:25.317 --> 20:26.952
Tender souls.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.952
This father-son bond was cemented

20:29.953 --> 20:31.952
over a would-be tragedy

20:31.953 --> 20:35.952
that haunts Richard Graves
to this very day.

20:35.953 --> 20:39.952
No man looks down the barrel of a gun

20:39.953 --> 20:41.538
and doesn't feel fear.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.669
But I chose to run for public office.

20:46.793 --> 20:49.792
And no five-year-old boy

20:49.817 --> 20:53.817
chooses to watch his dad...

20:58.953 --> 21:00.952
Yeah, ahem, it's all right, Jeremy.

21:01.823 --> 21:03.953
My son was there.

21:11.953 --> 21:16.952
You know, you've never spoken
about that day before, like, ever.

21:16.953 --> 21:19.952
You think maybe we could get together
and talk about it or something?

21:19.953 --> 21:21.952
Oh, I can't, son.

21:21.953 --> 21:25.952
I mean, I don't want to talk
about what was or what happened.

21:25.953 --> 21:29.953
I just can't do it anymore, son.

21:33.953 --> 21:36.952
Your father tends
to compartmentalize his pain.

21:36.953 --> 21:39.952
Fuck you, man, okay?

21:39.953 --> 21:41.952
Yeah, what's up, Emery?

21:41.953 --> 21:43.952
The best fucking agent
that ever lived got you a sit-down

21:43.953 --> 21:45.952
with Doug Johnson at The Storm Network.

21:45.953 --> 21:47.952
What did I tell you?
This thing you're doing,

21:47.953 --> 21:50.952
this fuck who my father was,
fuck everybody thing,

21:50.953 --> 21:52.952
this super amazing hate
you're channeling,

21:52.953 --> 21:54.163
they're offering you a contract.

21:54.164 --> 21:55.952
- Your own show.
- What?

21:55.953 --> 21:58.952
You're booked on the 7:00 to LA.
Can you get there?

21:58.953 --> 22:00.952
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.952
Just consider me out the fucking door.
Thank you so much.

22:02.953 --> 22:03.952
Thank you. Thank you, Emery.

22:03.953 --> 22:05.953
- Hey, Dad!
- What?

22:10.953 --> 22:11.999
Nothing.

22:13.496 --> 22:14.952
Look at the two of you.

22:14.953 --> 22:16.952
It's like peas in a fucking pod,
you know?

22:17.569 --> 22:20.952
Fuck it, I'm out. Yep.

22:20.953 --> 22:22.953
Fuck it, I'm out.

22:24.739 --> 22:26.738
Everybody's out.

22:28.953 --> 22:31.953
Chuy, don't forget your scale.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.952
Big, big mistake, ese.

22:36.953 --> 22:39.952
Okay. Rosa.

22:39.953 --> 22:41.952
Maria. Just some car snacks.

22:41.953 --> 22:45.953
For the road. Good luck with the drugs.

22:48.705 --> 22:50.704
Your wife's been a bit cagey,

22:50.705 --> 22:53.704
dancing around a Senate campaign

22:53.705 --> 22:55.704
that may or may not be happening.

22:57.272 --> 22:58.705
Are you the reason?

22:59.705 --> 23:02.704
Margaret has 100% of my support

23:02.705 --> 23:06.270
on all fronts, no matter what she does.

23:06.271 --> 23:10.704
But you've recently taken to making
some very un-Gravesian moves.

23:10.705 --> 23:12.704
You've appeared hell-bent

23:12.705 --> 23:16.704
on what some would say
is reversing policies

23:16.705 --> 23:18.287
that you yourself put into motion.

23:18.288 --> 23:22.201
I mean, for example, publically
denouncing your own economic strategy

23:22.202 --> 23:24.943
on monies allocated for cancer research.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.362
Times change, needs change.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.362
But much of what this country believes

23:30.363 --> 23:32.729
about modern American conservatism

23:32.754 --> 23:34.362
flows from the very river

23:34.363 --> 23:37.362
that you set in motion
while you were in office.

23:37.363 --> 23:39.328
What do you say to people

23:39.329 --> 23:42.362
that have followed you all these years?

23:42.363 --> 23:45.362
I guess we call them
the army of Gravesanites,

23:45.363 --> 23:48.118
the young and old,
the generation of politicians

23:48.119 --> 23:50.706
who've based their
political philosophies

23:50.731 --> 23:53.363
on your tenure as president.

23:56.363 --> 23:58.850
I'd tell them to get a life.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.527
- Get a life?
- Yes.

24:00.528 --> 24:02.362
To get their own life.

24:02.363 --> 24:05.721
Look, viewing the world
through the narrow perspective

24:05.722 --> 24:10.362
of my presidency is a dead end.

24:10.363 --> 24:14.362
You got this army, you say,
spouting ideology

24:14.363 --> 24:16.850
that they pretend to understand.

24:16.851 --> 24:20.629
I've got one of those true
believers right here in this house

24:20.630 --> 24:22.650
working for me.

24:22.675 --> 24:25.532
But who said I was right?

24:25.933 --> 24:28.932
Who said that? Not me.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.932
You know, Martin,

24:30.933 --> 24:33.932
conservative or liberal,
it doesn't matter.

24:33.933 --> 24:36.932
If all you are is a sum total

24:36.933 --> 24:40.476
of what somebody else believes,

24:40.686 --> 24:41.686
then you're no one.

24:43.805 --> 24:45.804
So I guess in the end,

24:46.485 --> 24:50.181
I'd tell them all to get a life.

24:52.149 --> 24:53.933
And we're out.

24:57.933 --> 24:58.932
Get a life.

24:58.933 --> 25:00.932
Mr. President, thank you.

25:00.933 --> 25:01.932
Thank you, Martin.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.932
Thanks. Thanks, guys. Thank you.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.932
Martin, thank you so much.

25:06.933 --> 25:08.933
Thank you.

25:14.933 --> 25:18.650
You see, kid? That's right.
That felt right.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.932
That's what it's about.

25:19.933 --> 25:21.932
Now that we owe ourselves a treat,

25:21.933 --> 25:26.932
get me a whiskey, neat, kid,
and pour yourself one, okay?

25:26.933 --> 25:27.933
Get it yourself.

25:29.933 --> 25:30.932
Excuse me?

25:31.372 --> 25:32.932
You heard me.

25:33.376 --> 25:34.933
Yeah.

25:37.510 --> 25:39.932
You know, I just... I have to ask.

25:39.933 --> 25:40.932
Is it just me?

25:41.589 --> 25:43.565
Do you just resent me, sir?

25:43.566 --> 25:46.307
Or should everyone who's ever
believed in you just get a life?

25:46.308 --> 25:47.932
What?

25:47.933 --> 25:50.932
Am I just a true believer
in the army of Graves?

25:50.933 --> 25:52.932
Just a faceless person to you, sir?

25:52.933 --> 25:53.932
What's going on here?

25:53.933 --> 25:56.337
You know, I came here
because I admired you, sir,

25:56.338 --> 25:57.932
and I wanted to learn
from someone that I admired.

25:57.933 --> 26:01.932
But the truth is I don't
even recognize myself anymore.

26:01.933 --> 26:03.932
I'm not this person.

26:03.933 --> 26:05.932
The risks that I've taken for you,

26:05.933 --> 26:08.932
the people that I've hurt,
the lies that I've told,

26:08.933 --> 26:10.932
I'm just... I'm not this person, sir.

26:10.933 --> 26:13.932
You know, I believe what I believe
in because it makes sense to me.

26:14.398 --> 26:15.932
It's who I am.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.932
And all this time I was just
hoping that the president I knew

26:19.933 --> 26:23.588
was still in there somewhere
because I believed in that man.

26:24.076 --> 26:25.933
I believed in you.

26:27.362 --> 26:29.274
Well, that was your own choice, Isaiah.

26:29.275 --> 26:31.645
You know, I've tried to teach you,

26:31.646 --> 26:33.555
but you just do not learn.

26:33.556 --> 26:36.385
You're locked up in fear.

26:36.933 --> 26:39.932
You're a lost fuckin' cause.

26:39.933 --> 26:44.200
No, you're the one
who's lost the cause, sir.

26:44.225 --> 26:45.848
- Oh.
- Okay, I don't know

26:45.873 --> 26:47.298
who you think you are, young man.

26:47.299 --> 26:49.932
What did I tell you? I warned
you not to romanticize.

26:49.933 --> 26:52.932
This is not your father.
You are not a member of this family.

26:52.933 --> 26:56.933
You are an employee and you
don't get to be disappointed.

26:57.933 --> 26:59.932
Disappointed?

26:59.933 --> 27:01.932
Yeah, that's a word.

27:01.933 --> 27:06.932
Here's a few more...
dishonest, disingenuous,

27:06.933 --> 27:09.932
disillusioned,
like disillusioned with a family

27:09.933 --> 27:11.932
who does nothing but lie to each other

27:11.933 --> 27:14.932
over and over all the time.
You want to know the truth?

27:14.933 --> 27:16.932
You want to know what's happening
right in front of your faces?

27:16.933 --> 27:19.932
- Isaiah.
- Jeremy went to Colorado and testified

27:19.933 --> 27:23.262
on Martin Treadwell's behalf.
That's why he's getting out.

27:23.263 --> 27:25.932
And he didn't even give a shit
enough to tell either of you about it.

27:25.933 --> 27:28.932
Oh, and by the way, Olivia's pregnant.

27:28.933 --> 27:31.932
She hid in her room, took,
like, a dozen pregnancy tests

27:31.933 --> 27:33.932
and all of them are positive.

27:33.933 --> 27:35.932
So congrats, Grandma and Grandpa.

27:35.933 --> 27:37.932
Now you can pass on
your dysfunctional genes

27:37.933 --> 27:39.933
to the next generation of Graves.

27:44.933 --> 27:48.933
Fuck it, I quit.

28:34.535 --> 28:36.932
There's such a lot
of history in this room.

28:36.933 --> 28:38.932
Yeah. Yes.

28:38.933 --> 28:42.932
Well, that's where it all started.
