00:04.104 --> 00:06.405
911. What's your emergency?

00:06.407 --> 00:09.541
Um, I'm 13,
and I'm home alone,

00:09.543 --> 00:12.177
but there's this girl
who's been banging on the walls

00:12.179 --> 00:14.013
for hours in my apartment.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.749
And my mom's not home,
and I'm really scared,

00:16.751 --> 00:20.285
and I don't know what to do.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.521
911.
What's your emergency?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.356
Hi, there's a girl
in my building

00:24.358 --> 00:26.058
screaming that she's gonna
kill everyone here

00:26.060 --> 00:27.659
and that we're all out
to get her.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.696
You need to send the police.
This chick is crazy.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.798
911. What's your emergency?

00:32.800 --> 00:35.067
This is, like, the third time
that I've called this month.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.668
The bitch is crazy.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.138
Sir, please calm down.
The police are coming.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.639
Y'all need to send
someone fast

00:40.641 --> 00:43.308
before she blows this place up.
I'm serious.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.610
Yes, we have been notified

00:44.612 --> 00:45.811
by other tenants
in the building.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.446
The police are on their way.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.489
I live below her.
This is my third time calling.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.658
When are you guys
sending someone out?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.728
I don't understand
why you guys keep coming here
and nothing happens.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.330
Sir, I can't do anything
from my end.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.500
You have to stay calm and wait
for the cops to arrive please.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.668
She plays loud music

01:09.670 --> 01:11.203
and then screams
out the window

01:11.205 --> 01:12.805
and just keeps doing this
over and over.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.607
It's been going on
since 5:00 A.M. this morning.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.809
Ma'am, I understand that.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.710
Please stay inside
your apartment.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.146
The police are on their way.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.249
Hello, this is Autumn.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.818
Your sister is at it again!

01:25.820 --> 01:27.686
-You said it would stop,
and it hasn't.
-What?

01:27.688 --> 01:30.556
It's gotten worse.
I can't take it anymore!

01:30.558 --> 01:33.325
- Okay-- okay.
- -I want her gone!

01:33.327 --> 01:35.828
Please-- please, no,
don't call the police.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.429
I'll be right there.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.206 --> 01:47.606
Look, I told you
I'm coming, okay?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.374
Is she still
at the apartment?

01:49.376 --> 01:52.244
Okay, just keep her there
until I can get her, okay?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.213
Hold on a second.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.258
Look what she did to me.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.759
She slammed the door
in my hand.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.862
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna deal with it, okay?

02:09.864 --> 02:13.398
Cami? Cami, it's Autumn.
Open the door.

02:16.536 --> 02:17.803
Just stay here.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.439
I'm not going in there.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.747
Cami?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.397
Cami, where are you?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.281
Sis, so glad
you could make it.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.549
Cami, what are you doing?

03:03.551 --> 03:06.919
Are you off
your medication?

03:06.921 --> 03:08.820
You mean
the mind-controlling pills?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.355
I'm not thinking
their thoughts anymore.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.857
Those pills
are implanted with memories.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.625
You're just trying
to make me the same as them!

03:13.627 --> 03:15.460
Let's just relax, okay?
Let's just sit down, okay?

03:15.462 --> 03:17.396
Look, what happened
to all your furniture?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.500
Cami, listen to me, okay?

03:21.502 --> 03:24.636
Let's just talk, okay?
Just talk to me, okay?

03:24.638 --> 03:27.206
I found it, sis.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.341
Found what?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.943
The chip.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.979
What are you talking about?

03:33.981 --> 03:37.583
The g.P.S. Chip.
It's in my finger.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.218
They didn't think
I'd find it.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.520
Okay, okay,
let's just sit down--

03:41.522 --> 03:43.589
and they've been visiting me
and leaving clues at my door,

03:43.591 --> 03:44.957
and they're just
trying to trick me.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.592
Get her crazy ass
out of here right now!

03:46.594 --> 03:48.260
And he's one of them!

03:48.262 --> 03:49.528
He is not a manager!

03:49.530 --> 03:51.296
He is a plant working
for the CIA,

03:51.298 --> 03:52.831
and they know
that I know about them.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.466
They know that I know
about the mission to Mars,

03:54.468 --> 03:55.734
aliens, NSA.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.636
I gotta-- I gotta--

03:57.638 --> 03:59.504
I gotta expose them.
I gotta expose them.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.307
It might just save you all.

04:02.309 --> 04:06.878
Look. Look, look,
look, look, look.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.981
Look, see?

04:08.983 --> 04:11.984
See? See the symbols?
The symbols?

04:11.986 --> 04:13.685
They don't think
i know what it means,

04:13.687 --> 04:17.422
but I do! I do!
I understand what it means.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.860
Cami, this is a flyer
for a Chinese restaurant.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.966
No! You are no--
you are not my sister.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.868
They sent you.
They sent you.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.370
They sent you to trick me!

04:31.372 --> 04:33.705
- Cami-- cami--
- I am not forsaken!

04:33.707 --> 04:35.340
I'm the chosen one.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.476
I'm not forsaken.
I am the chosen one.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.478
I'm not forsaken.
I am the chosen one!

04:39.480 --> 04:41.380
Cami, are you off
your medication?

04:41.382 --> 04:41.380
Where are your pills?

04:41.382 --> 04:52.024
I am not forsaken,
i am the chosen one.
They cannot come against me.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.932
Cami, stop for a second.
Take your pills.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.468
Okay? Take the pills.
Just take the pill--

05:03.470 --> 05:05.737
ow!

05:05.739 --> 05:07.906
God.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.420
Uh, 27, I've got both the victim
and the suspect here.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.459
Are you the sister?
Autumn bergman?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.694
Step-sister.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.395
My name is Anne Matthews.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.563
I'm with the department
of mental health,

05:31.565 --> 05:32.964
L.A. county.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.567
I have a few questions
regarding your sister.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.602
Do you know how long
she's been off her meds?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.371
No, I don't.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.772
How long has she been
exhibiting this behavior?

05:40.774 --> 05:43.975
Um, ever since our--

05:43.977 --> 05:45.811
well, my father
and her mother died.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.547
- Uh-huh.
- They were in a car accident.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.948
It's gotten worse since then.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.516
Three years at least.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.951
May I just say that
in the past two months

05:52.953 --> 05:55.821
cops have been called out
six times on a 5150.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.457
Now, cami is smart enough
to know the system

05:58.459 --> 06:00.392
and that there's only
a 72-hour hold.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.927
So what can be done?

06:01.929 --> 06:04.463
Well, the cycle will continue
until she goes to jail

06:04.465 --> 06:05.797
or gets real treatment,

06:05.799 --> 06:08.033
which is what she needed
in the first place--

06:08.035 --> 06:10.402
a treatment facility.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.004
Now, her mom died.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.073
Is there any other
next of kin?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.409
I'm the only family she has.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.478
Well, you have
a big decision to make.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.546
Cami harmed
multiple people tonight.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.915
Herself as well
as officers included.

06:23.917 --> 06:28.120
There will be charges
brought against her.

06:28.122 --> 06:31.056
But, you know, see,
that's why I'm here.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.025
After she's booked,
i will work with her lawyer

06:34.027 --> 06:35.894
on a plea deal
for her to enter

06:35.896 --> 06:39.064
into a long-term treatment
program instead of jail time.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.133
No, cami would never
agree to that.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.668
That's not her decision.
It's yours.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.904
You being
the only next of kin,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.672
we can do
an emergency petition

06:47.674 --> 06:50.909
downtown tomorrow morning
for a conservatorship,

06:50.911 --> 06:54.045
and that means you would be
making the decisions for cami

06:54.047 --> 06:55.847
as long as the judge sees fit.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.749
I don't know.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.419
Look, I don't know if cami would
do well in a facility.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.987
She's not doing well out here.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.889
Autumn,
it's the only choice.

07:03.891 --> 07:07.025
Cami's gonna end up killing
herself or somebody else.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.160
She needs this.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.562
You're doing the right thing.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.631
I hope so.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.733
- I know.
- I understand.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.869
Autumn! Please. Sis, please.
Don't let them take me.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.005
It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.173
You have to go.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.945
You have to go.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.219
Your books changed my life.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.488
When I broke my leg
and I couldn't leave the house,

07:36.490 --> 07:38.523
I read them all the way through
without stopping.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.692
-You helped me heal.
-That is so nice of you to say.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.927
Which one was your favorite?

07:41.929 --> 07:44.830
Your first one.
"Fields of silver."

07:44.832 --> 07:47.899
I cried so hard
i think I was dehydrated.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.501
Well, thank you for coming.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.069
Thanks.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.774
Well, hello. And who can
i make this out to?

07:55.776 --> 07:58.076
Jessie. "To Jessie,
don't stop writing,

07:58.078 --> 07:59.911
and don't give up
on your dream."

07:59.913 --> 08:02.481
- Are you a writer?
- Yes.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.982
I write
murder mystery stories,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.718
but my teacher says
I'm too young

08:06.720 --> 08:08.753
to be writing
about that kind of stuff,

08:08.755 --> 08:11.223
so I want you to write that
on the inside there

08:11.225 --> 08:12.858
so I can read it to myself

08:12.860 --> 08:15.660
when they all tell me
I'm too young.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.702
"Don't ever give up
on your dreams, Jessie,

08:23.704 --> 08:27.639
no matter who or what
tries to stop you."

08:27.641 --> 08:30.775
I won't. Thank you.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.979
This just came for you.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.515
- We need to wrap this up.
- Okay.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.116
One second please.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.564
Hey, babe.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.166
Oh. You were out
like a light.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.168
Yeah. Tired.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.171
Baby's been kicking me
all morning.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.606
You know,
i still can't believe

09:01.608 --> 09:03.642
that you binge-watch
these cop shows.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.944
Well, you know
that I like to see

09:05.946 --> 09:07.112
how they solve the murders.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.547
Yeah.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.548
Oh, my god.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.249
What is it?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.817
The 3-d imaging place,

09:12.819 --> 09:14.085
they just emailed me
the sonogram.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.955
Look.
That's our baby's face.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.060
That's our baby.

09:31.837 --> 09:37.008
My whole life,
I've waited for this moment.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.778
A child. I mean...

09:39.780 --> 09:43.915
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a father.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.152
Thank you.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.988
Thank you, des.
Thank you.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.657
I just--
i can't believe I doubted

09:52.659 --> 09:54.125
the fertility
treatments were working.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.827
It's...

10:00.166 --> 10:03.034
All the money in the world
isn't worth this moment.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.875
Two kilos were missing.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.344
If you don't tell us
what we need to know,

10:12.346 --> 10:15.246
we're gonna have child services
take your baby.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.882
You ain't taking my baby.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.784
I already told yo' ass

10:19.786 --> 10:21.319
I don't know nothing
about no drugs.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.356
Now you bring your ass back up
in my house here again

10:24.358 --> 10:26.891
and you ain't never
gonna leave.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.694
Not alive, at least.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.663
Carmen, that was great.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.766
Yeah, that, was,
uh, that was hot.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.335
Um, I wanna take
a different approach.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.837
I wanna try something
a little different.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.240
Like, um, play it
a little less tough.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.675
You know what I'm saying?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.276
Like she got
a lot more to lose.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.811
You understand
what I'm saying?

10:46.813 --> 10:50.048
I-- I think so.
Just give me one minute.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.217
Cool.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.700
Come on. We know you was there
the night Ricardo got shot.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.101
Two kilos went missing.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.770
If you don't tell us
what we need to know,

11:11.772 --> 11:13.938
we're gonna have child services
take your baby.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.077
You ain't taking my baby.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.945
Now, I already done
told yo' ass,

11:20.947 --> 11:23.982
I don't know nothing
about no drugs.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.085
No, you bring your ass
back up here in my house

11:27.087 --> 11:30.188
and you ain't
never gonna leave.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.123
'Least not alive.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.294
That was hot. Yeah.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.897
We loved you, by the way,
in "blazing hearts."

11:38.899 --> 11:40.765
Oh, thank you. Yeah, that was
one of my leading roles--

11:40.767 --> 11:42.133
my first leading role,

11:42.135 --> 11:43.802
and I was so excited
to work with everybody,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.303
especially
Michael Goldstein.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.072
He is an amazing director.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.773
Yeah, he is.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.141
- Yeah.
- Great.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.843
Well, have a wonderful day.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.345
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.485
I did it two different ways,

12:00.487 --> 12:02.187
but I knew the first time
was right.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.723
They were just testing to see
if I can take direction.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.324
Yeah, well...

12:06.326 --> 12:08.960
All right, let me know
as soon as they give feedback.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.098
All right.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.899
Bye.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.288
And your ice cream.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.491
Mm, thank you, babe.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.326
Oh, this was
on the door for you.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.161
Oh. Okay.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.529
Okay, so you're good?
You have everything you need?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.131
If I need anything,
I'll call you.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.932
All right. I love you.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.334
I love you, too.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.336
-Have a good day at work, hon.
-All right.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.323
Guys, I just don't think
it's a very good idea.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.292
We put her away.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.960
If she wants to meet us all
to apologize,

13:15.962 --> 13:17.996
I think we can at least
give her a bit of our time.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.131
That girl is
holding nothing for me.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.234
You think it's part
of some sort of 12-step
program or something?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.403
- I don't know.
- Probably.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.543
"I have a lot to say to you
and apologize for.

13:31.545 --> 13:34.145
I need your help
in moving forward with my life.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.947
I have something
very important to tell you.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.115
Please."

13:37.117 --> 13:38.416
I don't trust it.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.584
Who knows
what she's been up to

13:39.586 --> 13:41.286
for the last two years?

13:41.288 --> 13:44.055
Very true. We really don't know
how stable she is.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.091
I would maybe meet with her
if I wasn't feeling like this.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.194
I get these waves of tiredness
where I can't even walk.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.863
That's 'cause you're hosting
a parasite in your body.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.565
I'm just kidding.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.100
Aw, I didn't mean it.
I didn't.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.036
No, seriously,
though, physically,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.572
I'm really-- I don't know,
I'm just not up to it.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.841
What could she
possibly have to say
that's so important?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.209
"Oh, I'm sorry for trying
to ruin your life

14:04.211 --> 14:06.110
or make your life
a living hell, or--"

14:06.112 --> 14:08.446
seriously? You two
are being so selfish.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.881
Do you know how much
guts it took

14:09.883 --> 14:12.183
for cami to even
write us these letters?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.618
Yes, she made our lives hell,

14:13.620 --> 14:16.554
but a lot can change.
A person can change.

14:16.556 --> 14:20.225
People don't change.
Circumstances do.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.393
What if you
were in her boat,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.429
trying to apologize
to your former best friends?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.097
Okay, she is not
your former best friend.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.632
She is your sister.
Let's not forget that.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.967
You have more willingness
to forgive her

14:28.969 --> 14:30.001
than Carmen and I.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.903
Autumn, don't you remember

14:31.905 --> 14:33.238
all the shit she pulled

14:33.240 --> 14:35.106
before we finally
could get her committed?

14:35.108 --> 14:37.008
Yes, of course I remember.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.509
But think about how I feel.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.112
Don't you think I hurt?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.147
She's the only family
that I have left.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.586
My dad would have wanted me

14:48.588 --> 14:50.455
to give her a second chance.
Can't you understand that?

14:54.059 --> 14:58.363
Okay, what if this
had happened to one of us?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.098
Carmen, what if you
were mentally ill?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.100
I damn near sometimes
think I am. Shit.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.434
I'm serious.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.003
You have your crazy moments

15:05.005 --> 15:06.471
when we think
you're out of your mind.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.340
Especially when it comes
to your career.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.677
And, des, I mean, this could
have easily been you.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.545
Look at you in college,

15:14.547 --> 15:16.347
how many times
you blacked out,

15:16.349 --> 15:17.515
woke up not knowing
where you were

15:17.517 --> 15:20.184
and who
you were lying next to.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.154
And that withdrawal you had
when you gave up drinking.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.991
Yes, but alcohol
and mixing schizophrenia
and crystal meth,

15:26.993 --> 15:28.626
Autumn,
it's two different things.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.162
You're missing the point.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.464
You had your chance
to turn your life around.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.967
Who are we to stand
in her way to do the same?

15:35.969 --> 15:39.570
Okay, fine. You win.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.339
Jesus.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.309
I can't deal with all these
emotions today.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.978
Autumn, we're doing this
for you, okay?

15:46.980 --> 15:50.048
We'll meet with cami,
let her say what she has to say,

15:50.050 --> 15:52.717
but that does not mean
that she's coming back
into our lives, okay?

15:52.719 --> 15:56.688
And we'll all do it together,
and that'll be that.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.724
Thank you, guys.

15:59.726 --> 16:03.161
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.562
I need more of this wine.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.265
You ordered more carbs
than I've had all year.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.567
I'm feeding two, remember?
My parasite.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.270
Wait, so whose place
are we having this meeting at?

16:12.272 --> 16:13.471
Well, where's cami staying?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.541
You know cami.
She will surface.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.276
Autumn, I say
we do it at your house.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.079
Mm-mm. The last time cami
was at my house,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.314
she stole a faberge egg
and pawned it to buy drugs.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.716
Well, she stole
tom's diamond cufflinks

16:24.718 --> 16:26.751
and god knows what else.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.486
And my grandmother's
Ruby necklace
and blu-ray player.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.088
Okay, so our houses are out.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.256
Well, what about a restaurant
or a Starbucks?

16:32.258 --> 16:34.292
No, 'cause if
it's a public place
and she makes a scene,

16:34.294 --> 16:35.727
that would not be good
for my career.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.029
Okay. What about a park?

16:38.031 --> 16:40.031
There's not enough
people there.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.599
Motel room?

16:41.601 --> 16:45.470
Seems a little impersonal.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.272
What about we just rent
an apartment for the day?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.008
That's a really good idea.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.476
That way she can think
it's one of your houses

16:51.478 --> 16:53.077
and feel welcomed.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.013
Carmen, we can say
it's your new place.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.647
Okay, fine.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.549
Once you hear from her,
I'll book it online.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.084
Then we have
our little pow-wow,

17:00.086 --> 17:03.021
go our merry way,
and have a clean slate.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.321
See? It all worked out.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.089
Everything is gonna be fine.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.498
Anyway, thanks for helping me
set this place up.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.532
These gifts, I mean,
i just wanna get it all done

17:15.535 --> 17:16.733
before he gets back from...

17:16.736 --> 17:18.502
Oh, honey,
i charge 50 an hour.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.104
Cash only. Thank you.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.272
Okay. I get it now.

17:25.744 --> 17:29.347
- Come here quick.
- What?

17:29.349 --> 17:31.349
Quick. Quick.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.586
It's the first time
he's kicking.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.722
Wow.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.724
Wow. Ooh, wow.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.662
He kicked me.
Does it hurt?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.631
No. No, it doesn't.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.299
Who would have thought

17:48.301 --> 17:50.368
that two nine-year-old
little girls from Van nuys

17:50.370 --> 17:52.670
would be sitting
in a Beverly hills mansion,

17:52.672 --> 17:54.439
sipping iced tea
out of crystal glasses

17:54.441 --> 17:56.407
and discussing
diamond necklaces?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.076
I know.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.377
Well, we did it together.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.145
Yeah.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.847
You know, I wonder what
our lives would have been like

18:02.849 --> 18:05.416
if we never would have
met at girl scouts

18:05.418 --> 18:07.785
or never
would have met Autumn.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.656
Very different. I mean,
no weekend trips to Malibu

18:11.658 --> 18:13.191
with her family.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.293
No New York
high school celebration

18:15.295 --> 18:16.527
for graduation with her dad

18:16.529 --> 18:18.129
when he did
his book signing there.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.530
And you definitely
would have got kicked out

18:19.532 --> 18:21.199
freshman year from ucla

18:21.201 --> 18:23.134
if her dad didn't know
the department head.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.502
And you wouldn't have gotten
into the actor's studio

18:24.504 --> 18:25.870
if he didn't
make that phone call.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.239
Oh, yes, I would have,
thank you very much.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.608
Well, either way,
we owe Autumn and her dad

18:30.610 --> 18:31.809
for a lot of the good things

18:31.811 --> 18:32.810
that have happened
in our lives.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.278
Yeah, we do.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.716
- I'm afraid for her.
- Because of the dinner?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.518
Yeah.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.853
She's not as strong as us,
Carmen,

18:41.855 --> 18:43.454
and she doesn't--
she wasn't born

18:43.456 --> 18:45.123
with that fire inside of her.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.358
And if cami
really hasn't changed,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.227
I'm just afraid
that she's gonna go

18:49.229 --> 18:50.428
into this deep
depression again,

18:50.430 --> 18:51.596
just like the last time.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.730
That's what we're here for.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.265
And I can really care less

18:54.267 --> 18:55.733
what that thief cami
has to say to me.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.335
You cross me once...

18:57.337 --> 18:58.870
Then you better not
come across me again.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.805
Yeah, I know. I know.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.574
I just think of her dad,
and...

19:03.576 --> 19:04.709
If he would have seen what--

19:04.711 --> 19:06.777
we're doing it for him.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.381
Yeah, you're right.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.484
Pizza's ready.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.653
Oh. Come on, mama.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.455
- Ugh.
- Big belly.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.435
Hello.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.904
Hey, cami texted me.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.438
She wants to meet
Friday at 7:00.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.540
Does that work for you?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.208
It's good for me and des.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.510
- That's fine.
- Have you found a place?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.179
I did.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.880
Perfect. Thanks, Carmen.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.549
I know this isn't easy.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.450
Anything for you guys.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.786
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.669
Jacob? Hi.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.370
Uh, Carmen.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.905
Right.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.408
I'm so sorry.
I'm running behind.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.876
I wanted to do
a quick maintenance check

20:11.878 --> 20:13.844
of everything in the house,
and everything is fine.

20:13.846 --> 20:17.481
I just wanted to just finish up
this smoke detector.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.685
Why don't you, uh, take a look
around the house

20:20.687 --> 20:23.988
and I'll come out there
and give you the lay
of the land?

20:41.440 --> 20:44.408
So I just wanna give you
my cell number

20:44.410 --> 20:46.344
since my home number
is on the agreement.

20:46.346 --> 20:50.615
So if you need me for anything,
you can get me at any time.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.483
And I don't want
to make you feel awkward,

20:52.485 --> 20:56.420
but, um, I recognized you
on your rental profile picture.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.456
You're that actress,
the one who was in, um--

20:58.458 --> 21:00.458
- in "blazing hearts."
- Yes! Yes.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.927
That's the one.
You were so good.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.562
Thank you.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.364
I'm a huge fan.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.833
Oh, that's sweet.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.403
I'm gonna watch
everything you're in.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.006
All right,
it was nice meeting you.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.974
Have fun with your friends.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.912
Thanks.

21:29.621 --> 21:34.592
That's about right. Mm.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.865
Who is it?

21:40.867 --> 21:42.533
It's your favorite person
in the world.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.534
Oprah?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.938
Nice place.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.940
Good job finding it.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.510
Thanks.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.378
Whew.
How are you feeling?

21:54.380 --> 21:55.946
I'm good, you know.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.915
Having a watermelon
strapped to your stomach

21:57.917 --> 21:59.884
- 24/7 can get old real quick.
- Uh-uh.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.686
Especially when you
got a bad back like I do.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.888
I know. That's why
I'm never having kids.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.557
I'll adopt, but ain't nothing
ever popping out of me.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.728
Oh, you say that now,
but you might change your mind.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.430
You cooked, Carmen.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.532
Yeah, I made cami's favorite,
Italian.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.734
Who knows the last time
she had a home-cooked meal.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.969
That was nice of you.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.072
And I see you brought
some wine, too.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.709
I need this to loosen up.
This is hard for me.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.644
Remember to breathe.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.083
- Nice place.
- Ooh, you scared me.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.418
Hey. You look great.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.853
Oh, thank you.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.655
- New shoes?
- Yeah, I got 'em on sale.

22:37.657 --> 22:38.989
- Nice.
- Right?

22:38.991 --> 22:40.358
Yeah.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.692
Jeez, what a great place,
Carmen.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.793
I'm glad you approve.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.061
- Drink of choice?
- Oh, thank you.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.097
Mm-hmm.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.365
Well, thanks again,
guys, for doing this.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.699
I really appreciate it.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.401
It's okay.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.969
Yeah, I just want her
to come and say her peace

22:51.971 --> 22:53.771
and be on her way.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.707
Well, I found
some great options online.

22:56.709 --> 23:00.044
Maybe we can all passively
suggest some of them to her.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.712
Group homes.
Support groups.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.614
Good idea.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.483
Well, that's if she's not
already living somewhere.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.052
True. But at least
it'll show her that I care.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.820
Well, she should
be here soon.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.655
I mean, 'cause this food's
getting cold.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.491
Aw, she loves pasta.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.493
Yeah, I know, and I even tried
those vegan meatballs.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.927
I mean, they're not
as bad as I thought.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.162
I mean, they look like barf,

23:18.164 --> 23:19.830
but they taste
like the real thing.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.832
See, and so much better for you
and the environment.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.734
Mm. Sorry, guys.
I need to start eating.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.603
If I don't eat every few hours,
i get light-headed.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.138
You were like that
before you got pregnant.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.874
- What's the difference now?
- Shut up, Carmen.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.509
Hey, at least I didn't eat

23:31.511 --> 23:32.943
a whole red velvet cake
to myself on my birthday.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.678
Okay, first of all,
that was a one-time thing,

23:34.680 --> 23:36.614
and that was the best
red velvet cake I have ever had.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.449
Yeah, and you were
the only one who would know

23:38.451 --> 23:40.484
since you ate the whole thing
before we could get a piece.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.553
Well, it's not my fault
you guys are always late.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.021
Well, we're here
on time today.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.491
Yeah, you knew better
than to be late today.

23:47.493 --> 23:48.926
What if she doesn't show up?

23:51.163 --> 23:53.597
I wouldn't do that
to you, sis.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.568
Cami.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.504
Wow, you look...

24:00.506 --> 24:02.072
Great.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.941
Thanks, sis.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.478
Cami.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.780
Carmen, I could smell
your cooking from down the hall.

24:11.850 --> 24:14.485
And, des,
you're pregnant.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.720
Yeah,
we finally got lucky.

24:16.722 --> 24:20.658
Luck has nothing
to do with it.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.494
So, cami, are you hungry?

24:23.496 --> 24:24.995
Starved.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.764
Autumn, why don't you
take her out to the back

24:26.766 --> 24:28.199
and wait for dinner?

24:28.201 --> 24:30.801
- Is this your new place?
- Yeah, I just moved in.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.037
Nice.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.695
Uh, so, how have
you been feeling, des?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.230
Mm. I'm feeling good.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.865
I'm a little tired, but...

25:00.867 --> 25:02.633
Can't do much of anything.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.702
Well, fortunately it's not
like you have to work,

25:04.704 --> 25:07.505
so you get to be lazy
and still live a great life.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.573
Lucky you.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.812
Well, I guess I'll say it.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.748
What the hell
happened to you, cami?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.783
I waited for you when you were
released from the facility,

25:19.785 --> 25:21.051
and you never showed up.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.153
Now, two years later,
here you are.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.623
No calls, no letters.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.125
Where have you been staying?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.060
With a friend.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.695
What have you been doing?

25:31.697 --> 25:34.265
Looking for a job,
an apartment--

25:34.267 --> 25:36.934
just doing
what normal people do.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.737
Well, if you need help finding
a place or any references--

25:39.739 --> 25:42.039
thanks, des,
i really appreciate that,

25:42.041 --> 25:43.941
but I don't wanna be
a burden on you guys.

25:43.943 --> 25:43.941
Oh, you're not a burden.

25:43.943 --> 25:47.144
We just wanna make sure you
have the support if you need it.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.013
That's really kind,
but I just wanna

25:49.015 --> 25:51.815
say my peace
and then be on the way.

25:54.085 --> 25:57.221
So how was the program?
Did it help?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.290
I got a fresh perspective
on everything.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.125
Believe me.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.593
Well, that's great.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.728
Then why did you leave?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.798
Well, that's why I'm here,
in a way.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.800
You obviously
all got my letters,

26:09.802 --> 26:12.603
and I have some things
I'd like to say to you three.

26:12.605 --> 26:15.806
I, in my own way,
appreciate and understand

26:15.808 --> 26:17.675
what you were doing
by having me committed.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.943
You cared about me enough

26:18.945 --> 26:20.711
to try to get
my schizophrenia treated

26:20.713 --> 26:22.846
and to get off the heroin.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.015
You know,
it took me almost a year

26:25.017 --> 26:26.350
to stop being angry
with you guys

26:26.352 --> 26:29.853
and really appreciate
what you did.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.656
You saved my life.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.758
And I was no prize.
I know that.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.161
I did things to all three of you
that were shameful.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.229
And if I could take them back,
i would, but I can't.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.898
All I could do is just sit here

26:40.900 --> 26:42.600
over this amazing
plate of spaghetti

26:42.602 --> 26:44.335
and just beg
for your forgiveness

26:44.337 --> 26:45.970
and hope that we could just
let the past die

26:45.972 --> 26:47.371
so that I could
really move forward

26:47.373 --> 26:49.206
and get a fresh start
with my life.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.241
So I sincerely apologize
for all the pain

26:51.243 --> 26:55.079
that I've caused.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.147
Well, I forgive you.

26:57.149 --> 27:00.017
I forgive you, too.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.652
I forgive you, cami.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.191
Group hug?

27:11.296 --> 27:12.763
Whew. Well.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.764
Okay.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.265
Oh, uh, Carmen,

27:15.267 --> 27:16.700
I've been
following your career

27:16.702 --> 27:17.901
since I've had
the extra time.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.036
Congrats on
"blazing hearts."

27:19.038 --> 27:20.638
It was a really
great movie.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.873
Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad you liked it.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.842
Yeah, it's really been
opening some doors for me.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.310
I'm auditioning for things

27:26.312 --> 27:28.178
I never would have
been considered for before.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.713
I mean, I auditioned
for the Denzel Washington

27:29.715 --> 27:31.148
movie the other day, so...

27:31.150 --> 27:33.384
Wow. That's amazing.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.019
How did you get the audition

27:35.021 --> 27:37.321
for "blazing hearts,"
by the way?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.355
Oh, it was through a friend.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.923
I was recommended for the role

27:39.925 --> 27:41.258
because it was so
character specific,

27:41.260 --> 27:42.993
and they really
wanted somebody

27:42.995 --> 27:45.095
that could, you know,
go there for the role, so...

27:45.097 --> 27:47.865
I bet you did.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.869
And, uh, des,
how far along are you?

27:51.871 --> 27:54.672
About six months?

27:54.674 --> 27:57.141
Yeah, six months
of eating as much

27:57.143 --> 28:00.110
as my mouth can chew.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.113
Well, I'm glad you're finally
able to have a baby.

28:07.285 --> 28:10.220
Um, so, cami,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.222
what are your ideas
for finding a job?

28:12.224 --> 28:14.792
Mm, not me, yet, sis.

28:14.794 --> 28:18.095
Tell me about your book.
What's it about?

28:18.097 --> 28:22.132
Um, well, it's, um,
a family drama

28:22.134 --> 28:24.001
about two siblings...

28:24.003 --> 28:25.469
Whose mother dies

28:25.471 --> 28:26.970
and leaves them searching
for the meaning of life?

28:26.972 --> 28:28.305
Yeah, I read it.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.707
You know,
there's some parallels

28:29.709 --> 28:31.775
between that story
and our family.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.410
But, I mean, who would know
besides me?

28:33.412 --> 28:36.280
Good read, though.
Very emotional.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.382
I'm glad you liked it.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.852
- Shit.
- Are you okay?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.721
- Yeah, I just need a minute.
- Is it a contraction?

28:43.723 --> 28:46.023
No. Baby's just kicking
my ribs really hard.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.458
Ooh. Okay.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.359
Uh, where's the bathroom?

28:49.361 --> 28:52.162
- First door on your left.
- Thanks.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.870
Ooh.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.806
Oh, she seems to be... normal.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.308
She took my wine.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.176
Okay, just...

29:25.764 --> 29:27.498
Can't believe this.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.066
Let's see
what she has to say.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.067
Yeah.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.435
She seems semi-normal.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.177
God,
what a beautiful night.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.346
God, I have missed
Los Angeles so much.

29:42.348 --> 29:46.950
Like, whoo! Los Angeles!

29:46.952 --> 29:48.152
We're all just lost angels.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.787
Lost angels in Los Angeles.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.291
You know something?

29:54.293 --> 30:00.230
This wine has got me
feeling so alive.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.534
I love you ladies.

30:03.536 --> 30:05.369
We love you too, cami.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.970
You know, that's good,
because I have some things

30:06.972 --> 30:09.807
I'd really like
to say to you three.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.109
What is it?

30:12.111 --> 30:14.578
After I left briarwood,
i went to Florida.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.146
Why were you down there?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.949
Well, this guy Tony--
Carmen, you met him.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.285
- The one you found--
- yeah, getting high on my couch
in his dirty underwear.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.586
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.154
Yeah, well, anyway,
he went down there

30:24.156 --> 30:26.089
to unload this big score
of oxy for this guy

30:26.091 --> 30:27.191
and we were gonna get 20%.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.992
But there was a mistake,

30:28.994 --> 30:31.595
a stupid mistake on Tony's part,
and the oxy was stolen.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.330
And I know this sounds odd,

30:33.332 --> 30:35.232
me telling you the story
about the street so casually

30:35.234 --> 30:36.834
when you're all living
the good life,

30:36.836 --> 30:38.268
but, well,
when I didn't have any money

30:38.270 --> 30:38.268
to get back to L.A.,

30:38.270 --> 30:41.071
I started dancing
at this club near the beach.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.105
You mean stripping?

30:42.107 --> 30:44.041
- Cami?
- Yeah, stripping.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.609
I had to do
what I had to do.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.477
You know
what I'm saying, girl?

30:47.479 --> 30:49.613
One night, the guy whose oxy
we were supposed to be selling

30:49.615 --> 30:51.248
came looking for me and Tony.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.016
You know, so Tony and i
tried to reason with him.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.384
He said he would
get him his money.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.420
So two weeks later,
the guy came back.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.289
Well, when Tony told him
we still didn't have any money,

30:59.291 --> 31:00.591
he shot Tony.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.459
He just shot him
right between the eyes.

31:02.461 --> 31:02.459
Oh, my god.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.295
I know, I ran and I hid,
and I got out of there.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.964
I just got out of there
on the next greyhound

31:06.966 --> 31:08.532
back to L.A.

31:10.168 --> 31:13.604
Last week, I got a message
sent to me from that guy.

31:13.606 --> 31:16.073
He told me I had one week
to come up with his money,

31:16.075 --> 31:18.442
with interest,
or he's going to shoot me

31:18.444 --> 31:20.410
- just like he did Tony.
- Cami.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.079
If you guys
really wanna see me

31:22.081 --> 31:24.281
get a fresh start on life
and really move forward,

31:24.283 --> 31:28.952
I need $75,000 by Sunday
or I am dead.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.320
I-- I would give it to you.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.955
I just don't have
that kind of money.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.457
Really?
You're a big star now

31:33.459 --> 31:35.125
with all these roles
coming your way.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.060
What she means is she doesn't
have that cash

31:37.062 --> 31:38.962
lying around, cami.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.665
Des, I know tom's business
is skyrocketing.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.200
Help me.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.668
I would have to talk
to tom about that.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.237
You know he hates me.

31:47.239 --> 31:51.975
Autumn, dad left you
in charge of the estate.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.911
I need the $75,000.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.178
It's in stocks
and real estate.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.513
Even if I were
to give it to you,

31:56.515 --> 31:58.181
it wouldn't be by Sunday.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.384
It's Friday night.
Everything's closed, cami.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.019
We'd really like to help you,

32:02.021 --> 32:03.086
but maybe we should
call the police.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.421
Yeah, and who is this guy?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.257
- I mean, he followed you--

32:07.259 --> 32:09.660
are you gonna give me
my money or not?

32:09.662 --> 32:12.529
Cami, you can't just
expect to see us

32:12.531 --> 32:14.464
and ask us
for this amount of cash.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.499
Especially
with all the hist--

32:15.501 --> 32:18.268
with what, Autumn?
Say it.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.003
With the drugs?
With the meth?

32:20.005 --> 32:21.638
We've all got our history,
don't we?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.674
Mine just happens to be
all out there in the open

32:23.676 --> 32:25.642
and you bitches have got yours
locked away tight.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.978
Okay, you're not gonna call me
a bitch in my own house.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.980
This isn't your house, bitch!

32:29.982 --> 32:32.649
- Okay.
- Don't you think I know
where you're living?

32:32.651 --> 32:34.251
- Told you this would happen.
- Oh, really?

32:34.253 --> 32:35.619
You knew it, des?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.721
Well, why don't we
talk about what I know?

32:37.723 --> 32:39.690
Cami, are you off your meds?

32:46.664 --> 32:49.566
These meds?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.668
I'm totally healthy, sis.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.237
Okay, everybody,
let's just calm down.

32:54.239 --> 32:55.672
Let's just take a moment
and breathe, okay?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.107
This is your fault, Autumn.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.241
My fault?
How is this my fault?

32:58.243 --> 32:59.643
If you would have just
given me

32:59.645 --> 33:01.278
my share of the money
from dad's estate

33:01.280 --> 33:02.546
like you were supposed to,

33:02.548 --> 33:04.014
then I wouldn't
have had to resort

33:04.016 --> 33:05.415
to selling oxy down in Florida

33:05.417 --> 33:07.351
and none of this shit
would have happened.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.052
All right, that's it.
Fuck this. I'm out.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.288
Oh, really?
Okay, Carmen.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.657
Maybe tmz
would love to find out

33:13.659 --> 33:16.493
how you actually got your role
in "blazing hearts."

33:20.465 --> 33:22.332
What did you say?

33:22.334 --> 33:25.302
How you fucked
Michael Goldstein for the role?

33:25.304 --> 33:26.536
The audition tape
went viral, cami.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.338
Why are you saying this?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.673
She knows.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.041
It's not gonna work,
cami, okay?

33:31.043 --> 33:32.509
The director gave interviews

33:32.511 --> 33:34.411
about how her audition
was game-changing.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.147
You didn't tell them?

33:37.149 --> 33:40.083
You know, it's funny
the tapes one can find

33:40.085 --> 33:42.686
when looking
for a blu-ray player
to sell for a dime bag.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.654
I burned those tapes
two years ago.

33:44.656 --> 33:48.225
Really? The one
with Michael Goldstein

33:48.227 --> 33:52.295
on your maroon rug,
calling him "papi."

33:58.103 --> 33:59.736
You stupid bitch.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.439
- No, no, stop it.
- Ooh, it's good to be back!

34:02.441 --> 34:03.540
Autumn plays the referee!

34:03.542 --> 34:05.042
You have some nerve, cami!

34:05.044 --> 34:06.510
This is not why we agreed
to meet with you.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.578
This isn't nice
what you're doing.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.149
Was it nice what you did,
aborting tom's babies?

34:12.150 --> 34:14.217
You're going to hell! Hell!

34:14.219 --> 34:16.386
Cami, stop it.
Stop it with the lies.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.188
- This isn't a lie, is it?
- Cami, stop it.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.290
I'm telling you to stop it.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.324
You never told them?

34:22.327 --> 34:25.695
I thought
you were all best friends
since the third grade

34:25.697 --> 34:27.230
and shared every
little thing together.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.766
- I'm gonna beat your ass.
- Ooh!

34:29.768 --> 34:35.371
I'm not lying. Here.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.840
Give me my money.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.809
They aren't real.

34:46.451 --> 34:47.784
Des, it has your info on it.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.518
Why do you have those?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.420
Because you were either
too stupid or too sentimental

34:51.422 --> 34:52.822
to cover your tracks.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.225
You know, after you had me
play chauffer

34:55.226 --> 34:57.494
and drive you to the clinic
for the second time,

34:57.496 --> 34:58.829
they fell out
of your back pocket

34:58.831 --> 35:00.130
onto the passenger seat.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.365
Your trash, my treasure.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.101
I wonder if tom
would still hate me

35:04.103 --> 35:05.402
after I told him
his precious wife

35:05.404 --> 35:07.170
was trying not
to have his babies.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.606
That's not true.
That's not true at all, okay?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.442
I felt pressured!
I did wanna have his babies.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.844
How the hell would you know
what I'm thinking?

35:13.846 --> 35:16.446
I was young!
I was 23 years old, okay?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.215
And he was pressuring me
to have his kid.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.183
You don't know how I felt!

35:20.185 --> 35:23.253
I don't owe you an explanation,
all right, cami?

35:23.255 --> 35:24.855
I trusted you in my house.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.490
How dare you steal
those sonograms?

35:26.492 --> 35:27.824
It's gonna take a lot more

35:27.826 --> 35:29.693
than a sofa bed
and a few hot pockets

35:29.695 --> 35:30.861
to buy my trust, honey,

35:30.863 --> 35:32.462
and it's gonna take
a lot more than that

35:32.464 --> 35:33.864
to keep my mouth shut.

35:33.866 --> 35:35.866
So what are you gonna do?
Blackmail us?

35:35.868 --> 35:38.335
Who's gonna believe
a lunatic junkie like you?

35:38.337 --> 35:41.538
Ouch. Burn. You see,
I've already thought about that,

35:41.540 --> 35:44.207
and that is why evidence
is so important.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.879
Get out, cami.

35:48.881 --> 35:51.681
Get out, and don't ever
let me see you again.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.450
But, Autumn,
I've saved the best for last.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.851
You didn't actually think
I'd let you leave here--

35:54.853 --> 35:56.686
cami, you are insane!

35:56.688 --> 35:58.421
Don't you understand that?

35:58.423 --> 36:00.357
After everything that
my family has done for you?

36:00.359 --> 36:01.758
Your family?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.194
Dad wouldn't like
hearing you say that.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.163
He's not your father, cami.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.898
He married your whore mother

36:07.900 --> 36:10.467
and took you in
and adopted you out of pity.

36:10.469 --> 36:13.370
You were never his daughter.
I am his daughter.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.238
And now after this,
you will never

36:15.240 --> 36:17.307
see a penny of his trust.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.878
I won't?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.847
I beg to differ.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.283
Cami, get out.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.518
We don't wanna hear any more
of this bullshit.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.786
You see?

36:29.788 --> 36:32.322
Before dad died,
when Autumn was away

36:32.324 --> 36:33.857
studying at college
to be a writer,

36:33.859 --> 36:36.326
I was the one spending
all my time with him,

36:36.328 --> 36:38.195
taking care of him,
cooking for him,

36:38.197 --> 36:40.530
reading his latest manuscript.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.265
That's right, Autumn.

36:42.267 --> 36:43.967
Dad gave me "fields of silver"
to read before he died.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.535
Shut your mouth.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.471
He wanted my opinion
on how it should end.

36:48.473 --> 36:50.373
Now, you can imagine
my surprise

36:50.375 --> 36:53.310
when six months later
you took it

36:53.312 --> 36:56.580
and published it
as your first novel.

36:56.582 --> 37:01.351
And you didn't even bother
to change the title.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.220
Like it or not,
the four of us

37:03.222 --> 37:06.556
are going to be tied together
for the rest of our lives.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.325
Now, you can either
give me my money

37:08.327 --> 37:12.229
or pay the fucking price.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.598
- No?
- Oh, god.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.666
You bitches had your chance.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.769
First stop...

37:19.771 --> 37:22.939
Tmz.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.808
Bitch, that ain't happening.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.576
Ugh.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.511
You fucking whore!

37:28.513 --> 37:30.747
Bitch, you are fucking dead!

37:30.749 --> 37:32.949
- I hate you!
- Stop!

37:34.452 --> 37:36.753
- Stop it!
- You stupid bitch!

37:36.755 --> 37:38.955
Stupid bitch!

37:38.957 --> 37:40.290
Stop it! Stop it!

37:40.292 --> 37:42.859
- No!

37:42.861 --> 37:43.927
She's pregnant!

38:00.945 --> 38:03.480
No! No!

38:05.983 --> 38:08.018
I hate you!

38:08.020 --> 38:09.452
Ugh!

38:28.439 --> 38:29.873
Oh, my god.

38:29.875 --> 38:30.874
Oh, my god.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.376
Okay.

38:33.378 --> 38:36.446
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

38:36.448 --> 38:39.516
Cami. Oh, my god.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.384
Cami, you're not
gonna be dead.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.886
Look at me.
You're not gonna be dead.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.921
Come on. Guys,
i don't know what to do.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.089
Keep pumping. Keep pumping.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.091
She's not breathing!

38:48.093 --> 38:50.593
Cami, please, just--

38:50.595 --> 38:50.593
I don't know what I'm doing!

38:50.595 --> 38:54.064
- What are we going to do?
- We have to call the police.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.932
- The police? And say what?
- That my step-sister is dead.

38:55.934 --> 38:55.932
What are we gonna
tell them, huh?

38:55.934 --> 38:59.002
That we were drinking
and then we got into a fight,

38:59.004 --> 39:00.370
and then we threw your
step-sister

39:00.372 --> 39:01.738
over a flight of stairs?

39:01.740 --> 39:03.573
No one's gonna believe us,
okay?

39:03.575 --> 39:05.709
- She's a junkie.
- Are you kidding me?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.777
What happens when they start
questioning and looking for her?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.379
They're gonna find out
when they start digging

39:09.381 --> 39:10.780
about everything
she knows about you,

39:10.782 --> 39:12.916
about Carmen, about me.
That's motive!

39:12.918 --> 39:14.718
No, we cannot
have police right now.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.387
- Are you fucking serious?
- She deserved this, Autumn!

39:17.389 --> 39:19.789
- She wouldn't stop!
- I need to call tom.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.658
- No.
- He'll know what to do.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.727
This stays between
the three of us, okay?

39:23.729 --> 39:24.961
No one will know
what happened here.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.030
Just give me a second.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.965
Oh, cami.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.633
Calm down.

39:30.635 --> 39:33.470
Okay. If we don't
call the police,

39:33.472 --> 39:37.006
what are our options?

39:47.084 --> 39:49.853
What's this?

39:49.855 --> 39:52.122
- Ugh.
- It's crystal meth.

39:52.124 --> 39:55.091
I can't believe
all that money on treatment

39:55.093 --> 39:56.726
and she never cleaned up.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.028
Problems were just too deep,
Autumn.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.431
Well, it looks like she took
the bus to get here.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.766
Won't someone know?

40:02.768 --> 40:04.534
Someone who saw her
on the bus maybe?

40:04.536 --> 40:06.035
Won't someone know
she was coming here?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.904
Well, the closest bus stop
is Hollywood boulevard.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.540
There's no way to prove that
she actually came here, though.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.175
Plus, I don't think anyone
would be looking for her,

40:12.177 --> 40:14.477
besides that guy she was talking
about looking for money.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.679
And I think she was
completely lying about that.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.081
Plus, if we were
to be questioned,

40:18.083 --> 40:19.949
we can say that, yeah,
she wanted to come here

40:19.951 --> 40:23.119
to talk to us about something,
but that she never showed up.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.157
Can't they search for blood?

40:27.159 --> 40:28.925
Won't they be able
to test this house

40:28.927 --> 40:30.927
for her fingerprints or DNA,
whatever they do,

40:30.929 --> 40:32.128
and tell she was here?

40:32.130 --> 40:33.163
We have to clean with bleach.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.465
Right.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.100
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.469
- We have to destroy her body.
- No.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.872
- We have to.
- And how are we supposed
to destroy her body?

40:42.874 --> 40:48.077
We burn off her fingertips
and pull out her teeth,

40:48.079 --> 40:52.515
make her unrecognizable
and unable to be traced.

40:52.517 --> 40:55.185
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.187
There has to be
another way out of this.
We can't do that.

40:57.189 --> 40:57.187
There is no other way.

40:57.189 --> 41:00.190
Do you wanna be writing books
from a cell?

41:00.192 --> 41:01.958
Or do you wanna be having
tom raise your baby

41:01.960 --> 41:03.526
'cause you're serving time
for murder?

41:03.528 --> 41:05.495
'Cause that's what it is.
Murder.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.696
She's not gonna make us
pay for this

41:06.698 --> 41:08.565
for the rest of our lives.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.467
- Yeah, but what if someone--
- forget the what ifs.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.769
This is what it is now,
and we have to act fast.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.471
But she's my step-sister.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.639
So what? She clearly had
no love for you.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.775
I mean, she outed you
for stealing your dad's book.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.678
Is what cami said about
"fields of silver" true?

41:21.680 --> 41:25.582
That your dad wrote it?

41:25.584 --> 41:28.151
- Yes, it's true.
- So you've been lying?

41:28.153 --> 41:29.786
And you haven't?
Sucking dick for a role?

41:29.788 --> 41:31.855
It takes more than talent
in this town, okay?

41:31.857 --> 41:34.257
- I needed that role.
- You're so much better
than that, Carmen.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.692
Oh, and what are you
better than, des?

41:35.694 --> 41:36.759
'Cause you're
no angel either.

41:36.761 --> 41:38.962
You two can judge me, okay?

41:38.964 --> 41:41.965
But neither one of you
would have understood
what I was going through.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.666
I was married to an older man.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.102
I felt pressure
to have the kid, and...

41:46.104 --> 41:50.240
Us three have been through
so much shit together, okay?

41:50.242 --> 41:53.243
But there's still
just some things

41:53.245 --> 41:56.045
that you don't even want
your best friends knowing about.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.848
Some things are just
between you and god.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.050
This is exactly
what cami wanted,

42:01.052 --> 42:04.287
to destroy the one thing
that cannot be replaced--

42:04.289 --> 42:06.689
our friendship.

42:06.691 --> 42:10.226
You two are all I have left.

42:10.228 --> 42:14.264
- I love you guys.
- I love you both.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.776
We get rid of her,
and then we clean this place

42:26.778 --> 42:28.711
like it's never
been cleaned before.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.080
Once we're done,
we're gonna burn

42:31.082 --> 42:32.715
all the clothes
that we're wearing, okay?

42:32.717 --> 42:34.250
We have to dismember her limbs

42:34.252 --> 42:36.085
and separate them
in different places.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.554
She was in
a treatment facility,

42:37.556 --> 42:39.289
so her DNA
is probably on file.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.958
We're gonna have
to burn her hair.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.761
What? I have a lot
of time on my hands

42:44.763 --> 42:45.929
being pregnant
watching "law and order"

42:45.931 --> 42:47.263
and "CSI" marathons.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.998
Okay, so how are we
supposed to do this

42:49.000 --> 42:50.667
in one night and with what?

42:50.669 --> 42:52.235
Well, we need tools,

42:52.237 --> 42:54.003
so there must be a maintenance
room in this building.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.005
Good idea.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.907
You go and look for tools,
and I'll start preparing
the space.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.710
Who the hell is that?

43:00.712 --> 43:02.278
Could it be the person
who owns this place?

43:02.280 --> 43:03.279
Jacob?

43:03.281 --> 43:06.015
- I'll go.
- Okay.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.750
Good evening, ma'am.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.652
We got a call about
a loud disturbance?

43:09.654 --> 43:11.120
Is everything okay here?

43:11.122 --> 43:13.990
A disturbance? Yeah.
Everything is fine.

43:13.992 --> 43:15.325
Is anyone at home
with you, ma'am?

43:15.327 --> 43:18.261
Um, yeah.
Yeah, my friends are here.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.831
So the disturbance, that's from
you and your friends?

43:21.833 --> 43:24.133
Sounds of screaming?

43:24.135 --> 43:27.937
- Um, yes.
- Baby, where are you?

43:31.308 --> 43:34.210
- Is everything okay?
- Is everything okay, ma'am?

43:34.212 --> 43:37.714
Oh, yeah.
Everything is just fine.
Is there a problem?

43:37.716 --> 43:42.018
Uh, we got a call
about some loud screaming.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.319
Oh, well, you see,
me and my girl,

43:43.321 --> 43:45.321
we were having a...

43:45.323 --> 43:50.727
So there was no banging
and pushing and screaming?

43:50.729 --> 43:51.728
None of that went on here?

43:51.730 --> 43:54.364
No, it did.

43:54.366 --> 43:56.966
Um, all right, ladies.

43:56.968 --> 44:00.036
Um, if there's--
if everything's okay here,

44:00.038 --> 44:01.137
we'll be on our way.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.039
You ladies have a good night.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.807
- Good night.
- Good night.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.346
Lesbians? Really?
That's what came to mind?

44:10.348 --> 44:12.115
Well, I got them
off our asses, didn't I?

44:12.117 --> 44:14.384
- Are they gone?
- Yes, they're gone.

44:14.386 --> 44:16.819
Good.
We got work to do.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.688
So what exactly
are we looking for?

44:18.690 --> 44:21.691
God, anything,
like a wrench, saws.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.960
Oh, try-- try here.

44:31.169 --> 44:34.103
- Shh!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:45.315 --> 44:47.417
I'm sorry.

44:47.419 --> 44:49.886
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding me.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.354
Okay.

44:51.356 --> 44:52.989
- Be careful.
- Careful.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.258
Okay.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.208
I'm coming. I'm coming.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.014
What kind of saw do we need?

45:18.016 --> 45:19.215
One strong enough
to cut through bone.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.084
What about the fingerprints?

45:21.086 --> 45:22.885
Desiree forgot to tell us
what we need for that.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.353
What about that blowtorch?

45:24.355 --> 45:26.055
I'm not using something
that'll blow up in my face.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.491
Or something. Something
to burn her fingerprints off.

45:28.493 --> 45:31.294
Oh, this is great.
Put that in here.

45:31.296 --> 45:32.995
This'll be perfect
for the teeth.

45:32.997 --> 45:35.364
Yeah.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.834
We can bash her teeth out
with this, too.

45:37.836 --> 45:40.002
We're not
bashing her teeth out.

45:48.278 --> 45:52.181
- What did you find?
- This crazy ass wants
to use a blowtorch.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.283
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

46:00.457 --> 46:04.861
This stuff
will definitely work.

46:04.863 --> 46:06.295
I can't believe
we're talking about this

46:06.297 --> 46:08.498
like we're about
to build a desk in shop class.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.300
That's exactly
what we're gonna be doing
in a prison labor camp.

46:11.302 --> 46:13.302
Let's go ahead and put the tarp
down on the floor.

46:13.304 --> 46:15.071
You guys'll have to do it.
I can't bend.

46:19.977 --> 46:21.544
Count of three. Ready?

46:21.546 --> 46:23.513
One, two, three.

46:27.184 --> 46:28.551
Oh, my god, she's heavy.

46:28.553 --> 46:31.320
- Lift.
- Okay. Okay.

46:31.322 --> 46:32.789
Hurry up.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.524
I'm trying.
I'm going backwards.

46:34.526 --> 46:36.793
Wait. Go to the left.

46:36.795 --> 46:39.962
- You're dropping her.
- Shit.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.369
Come on.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.943
Here, put these on.

48:11.355 --> 48:13.656
First, um, the fingers.

48:13.658 --> 48:15.057
How?

48:15.059 --> 48:17.960
Um, we can use
the grill outside.

48:17.962 --> 48:19.462
We could do it out there.

48:19.464 --> 48:22.131
No, we can't carry her body
on to the balcony.

48:22.133 --> 48:23.900
We don't know who
could see us out there.

48:23.902 --> 48:27.336
- We just have
to cut off her hands.
- Exactly.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.572
Carmen,
go turn on the grill.

48:39.216 --> 48:41.183
I guess I should be
the one to do it.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.124
All right.
I'll hold her down.

49:07.244 --> 49:09.145
You can do this.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.341
- Don't stop.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:38.343 --> 49:41.077
Keep going. Keep going!

49:44.548 --> 49:46.115
You're almost there!

49:46.117 --> 49:47.516
I don't know
if I can do this.

49:47.518 --> 49:50.619
Autumn,
you can do this! Go!

49:50.621 --> 49:52.288
Now!

49:58.261 --> 50:01.163
Harder. Harder!

50:06.136 --> 50:08.137
God, it won't break.

50:08.139 --> 50:10.272
You have to go
through the bone.

50:10.274 --> 50:12.008
You're not through it yet.

50:14.711 --> 50:18.414
Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe.

50:18.416 --> 50:22.018
Autumn. Autumn.
We're too far in.

50:22.020 --> 50:25.621
We have to do this.
There's no turning back.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.290
There's no turning back.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.696
All right,
you're almost there.

50:33.698 --> 50:36.699
Almost. Almost.
You're through the bone.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.100
You're through the bone.

50:38.102 --> 50:39.535
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.669
Just take it!
Just take it!

50:53.417 --> 50:55.251
Oh, my god, the smell.

50:55.253 --> 50:57.787
Ugh. Just let it sit there
for a minute and sizzle.

50:57.789 --> 50:59.588
You think we should put
some olive oil on it

50:59.590 --> 51:01.057
so it burns faster?

51:01.059 --> 51:03.092
It's not chicken,
Rachael ray.

51:03.094 --> 51:05.594
Just sayin'.

51:05.596 --> 51:08.364
Do you think Autumn's
all right in the bathroom?

51:08.366 --> 51:09.632
I hope so.

51:17.140 --> 51:18.808
- All right, I think it's done.
- Okay, wait.

51:18.810 --> 51:21.143
- It's burning.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

51:21.145 --> 51:22.411
- Grab it.
- Okay, I'm grabbing it.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.380
Okay, let's go.

51:27.517 --> 51:27.516
Carmen,
you're gonna have to be,

51:27.518 --> 51:30.419
'cause I need a moment.
I don't feel so good.

51:31.688 --> 51:33.489
I can't even look at her.

52:07.190 --> 52:09.859
Okay.

52:09.861 --> 52:13.362
All right.
Next, let's do the teeth.

52:13.364 --> 52:14.897
I guess that year
of dental school

52:14.899 --> 52:19.235
before I decided to be a writer
is finally paying off.

52:19.237 --> 52:22.371
Okay,
i need a bag for the teeth.

52:23.874 --> 52:25.341
Open her mouth.

52:33.583 --> 52:34.783
All right.

52:34.785 --> 52:36.519
I'm just gonna crack 'em all

52:36.521 --> 52:38.254
and pull out
any that are loose.

52:38.256 --> 52:39.822
Okay.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.857
Okay, just--
just keep her mouth held open

52:41.859 --> 52:45.528
and I'll go as fast as I can.

52:45.530 --> 52:47.496
This is easier
than I remember.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.632
That's 'cause her teeth
are brittle from all the drugs.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.233
Hey, des, will you
hold this bag for me?

52:51.235 --> 52:52.535
Yeah.

52:52.537 --> 52:55.571
- Okay.
- Oh, god.

52:55.573 --> 52:59.708
Oh, god. Hurry please.

52:59.710 --> 53:01.610
- Oh, shit!
- I'm sorry, des.

53:01.612 --> 53:03.646
- You touched me with it.
- I'm sorry!

53:03.648 --> 53:05.581
Just grab it.

53:06.816 --> 53:09.385
Like pulling weeds
out of a garden.

53:09.387 --> 53:11.353
You keep telling
yourself that.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.726
Okay. Okay.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.296
Okay.

53:20.298 --> 53:23.332
Now the limbs.

53:23.334 --> 53:25.201
You wanna do it?

53:25.203 --> 53:26.635
Well, I sawed off
a man's dick before

53:26.637 --> 53:28.771
in a reenactment show
years ago.

53:33.843 --> 53:36.312
Tmz, my ass.

53:37.881 --> 53:42.384
Oh, god.

53:42.386 --> 53:45.221
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
i cut into her stomach!

53:45.223 --> 53:46.989
- Put it back in!
- I can't!

53:46.991 --> 53:49.558
- Where are the scissors?
- Push it back in!
Push it back in!

53:49.560 --> 53:52.361
Carmen! Just stop it!

53:52.363 --> 53:54.663
Just stop! Just stop.

54:00.905 --> 54:02.972
How the hell
did you get her stomach?

54:02.974 --> 54:07.343
I'm sorry! I don't know.
I was just cutting.

54:07.345 --> 54:11.614
Remember,
keep going, okay?

54:11.616 --> 54:14.283
Yes. Now hold her down.

54:15.885 --> 54:17.786
Ready?

54:17.788 --> 54:20.623
- Hold her.
- Set. Go.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.858
Go. Go.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.766
Oh, god!

54:44.914 --> 54:47.483
Okay, open the bag.
Open the bag. Open the bag!

54:55.759 --> 54:57.693
Okay.

54:58.928 --> 55:00.996
Wrap her arms.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.631
Wrap her arms.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.633
Where's the tape?

55:11.074 --> 55:12.841
We're gonna clean this place.

55:12.843 --> 55:14.043
We're gonna take each bag

55:14.045 --> 55:15.844
and bring it
to a separate place

55:15.846 --> 55:17.680
so no one will ever
find the body.

55:17.682 --> 55:19.348
- Okay.
- Let's go.

56:11.901 --> 56:14.470
All right,
so where we gonna
take the body?

56:14.472 --> 56:15.671
Do you have any ideas?

56:15.673 --> 56:18.574
Um, yeah, I know a trail
in Griffith park

56:18.576 --> 56:20.476
that no one uses really.

56:20.478 --> 56:22.945
There have been some
mountain lion sightings
up there, too.

56:22.947 --> 56:24.847
Well, there's a cliff
in Malibu

56:24.849 --> 56:26.582
where the current is so strong
it'll wash it away quickly.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.450
All right. I know
some tracks in Burbank,

56:28.452 --> 56:30.018
train tracks
where there's high speeds

56:30.020 --> 56:32.154
every 30 minutes that pass by.

56:32.156 --> 56:34.123
So we can put the remains
on the track.

56:34.125 --> 56:35.691
They'll be demolished
in no time.

56:35.693 --> 56:38.694
Plus, um,
there's rats to eat it.

56:38.696 --> 56:40.963
Okay.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.799
Look, we have to promise
never to tell anybody

56:43.801 --> 56:45.401
what happened here tonight.

56:45.403 --> 56:47.469
Not only that,
i wanna never bring this up

56:47.471 --> 56:49.638
again amongst
each other either, ever.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.607
But we do have to have
a consistent story ready

56:51.609 --> 56:52.941
in case someone's
looking for cami

56:52.943 --> 56:54.576
and the police call us,
question us.

56:54.578 --> 56:56.678
Okay, okay,
we'll say that, um,

56:56.680 --> 56:59.081
she contacted all three of us
to meet up to apologize,

56:59.083 --> 57:01.016
and we were supposed
to meet up some place

57:01.018 --> 57:04.520
which was never determined
because she never followed up.

57:04.522 --> 57:06.755
- Okay.
- Promise?

57:06.757 --> 57:09.024
- Yeah. Promise.
- Promise.

57:09.026 --> 57:12.161
Well, let's go now while
it's still really dark out.

57:12.163 --> 57:13.929
All right. I'll drive.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.531
Okay.

57:16.566 --> 57:19.168
- Take this one.
- All right.

57:22.038 --> 57:23.605
- Okay.
- You got it?

57:23.607 --> 57:25.541
Yeah.

57:48.999 --> 57:52.201
- Last bag.
- I'll do this one.

58:23.099 --> 58:26.068
Cami, wherever you are,

58:26.070 --> 58:28.871
I hope you found your peace.

58:28.873 --> 58:31.507
I'm sorry.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.859
Okay.

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.185
Why don't you
pick up your phone?

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.521
You just need
to pick up your phone.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:45.093
...but you and I both know
you can't be in here.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.763
Three of my employees are dead.

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:48.797
What am I supposed to do?

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.766
Wait in the hospitality suite?

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:52.534
Des...

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.772
I'm not here to cause trouble,

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.540
but I'm also not here
to sit on the sidelines.

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.308
As long as there are bodies...

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.077
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:07.516
Look, I just--
i saw something.

01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:09.017
I don't even know what it was.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.186
Somebody needs
to call me back please.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.054
Just-- just please.

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:15.423
Just get Carmen
to come over here please.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:45.987
Are you okay?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.430
What happened?

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:58.099
Have either of you...

01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:01.069
Had any, like, nightmares?

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.071
I had something.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:04.973
A nightmare, a vision,
i don't know what it was,

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.608
but it scared the shit
out of me.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.376
Okay, maybe it was
just a bad dream.

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:13.348
No, but it wasn't a nightmare,
because I was awake.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:18.119
I-- I was working on my book
out in the other room,

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:22.290
and i-- I heard
this music box playing.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:27.028
Which-- I made this for her
when she was, like, ten.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.332
And, you know,
i come around the corner,

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.500
and she's standing there,

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:36.204
and she starts dancing
like when she was ten

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.608
at her first recital,
and she was in her pointe shoes.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:43.445
And then there was blood
everywhere and i--

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:46.615
Autumn, are you taking
those sleeping pills?

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:48.083
It felt so real.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:51.052
I mean, des, I even--
i even smelled

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.355
the strawberry bubble bath
that she used to use.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:55.357
I mean, how do you
even explain that?

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.625
Are you taking
those sleeping pills?

01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:58.059
Yes, I'm taking
the sleeping pills.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.061
I haven't slept
since it happened.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:03.131
Well, you know that those
can cause hallucinations.

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:09.070
Am I the only one that--

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.639
that's going through this?

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:13.942
I feel like
i am going crazy right here

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:17.112
and you guys are, like,
totally normal.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.314
I am literally
falling apart inside.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:23.652
I feel like I am going--
I'm turning into a crazy person.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:26.321
You know,
and I was the one
that did it.

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:29.157
I was the one that killed her.
It wasn't you two.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.293
- It was my fault.
- Your fault?

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:32.994
- Yes, and guys--
- we were all involved.

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:35.030
- We were all there.
- I was the one who pushed her.

01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:38.199
It was-- it was my hands.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:42.270
Guys, I just--

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.105
I just need to talk
to somebody about this.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.108
You can talk to us.
That's what we're here for.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.079
Really? I can talk to you,
des, huh?

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.515
I have tried
calling you both.

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:55.150
I am having these visions,

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:57.986
I am seeing
my dead step-sister,

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.689
and I try to call you guys,
and you don't pick up.

01:06:00.691 --> 01:06:02.590
So, really,
we're in this together?

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.159
I'd like you to explain
that to me.

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:06.728
Okay, well, unlike you,
i wanna get past this.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.330
I wanna forget about it.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.131
I think I need
to go to the police.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.666
- Police?
- Yes.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:11.666
Oh, no, you're not.
You are not going to the police.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:15.537
You wanna know why?
Because we all made
a promise to each other.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.539
- Didn't we?
- I have to, guys.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.407
It's the only way
i can clear my conscience.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.343
Autumn,
too much time has passed.

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:22.477
We cannot do that, okay?

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.146
Carmen, she's right, okay?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.315
Autumn,
I've been avoiding you.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.317
- Really?
- Yes.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.685
Why's that?

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.087
When I think
about what happened

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.255
and I think about your dad

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.525
looking down
and seeing us do it,

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.661
I just get this feeling
that i--

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:42.430
I don't deserve
to be a mother and--

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:43.598
don't you dare say that.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.467
You're gonna be
a great mother.

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:48.269
I don't know.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.273
Look, in all the years
of our friendship,

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:54.109
we've never broken
a promise to each other,

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:58.747
and we promised that we would
never talk about this again.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:01.549
Are we gonna keep
that promise?

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:05.086
Autumn, you can't
go to the police.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:09.424
Look, tom is in Tahoe
for the weekend, okay?

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.459
Why don't you both come over

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.529
and we'll cook
and watch movies and talk.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.232
That's a good idea.
We'll have, like,
a girl's day.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.767
- Yeah.
- I'd like that.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:21.069
Yeah,
get your mind off things.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.771
You know? Okay?

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.740
So, Autumn, you just
take a shower and get ready,

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:28.777
and I'll come back over
after my appointment
and pick you up, okay?

01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:30.378
And I'll come too
after I get off.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.313
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:34.682
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get through this.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.451
Okay.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.562
All right.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.197
I'll be back
in a little while, okay?

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.299
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.410
- What if she can't handle it?
- She will.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.079
I mean, after this weekend,
down the road,

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.680
I mean, what if she
keeps having these feelings

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.382
and we have to keep doing
these emergency interventions?

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:09.484
She'll have to handle it
or we're gonna--

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:10.685
or what?

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.620
Or we figure
something else out.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.722
What does that mean?

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.225
I don't know.

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:42.716
Hey, everyone!
Attention please.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.118
First, I'd like to thank
all of you

01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:45.487
for coming here tonight.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:45.487
You all are
very special to me.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:48.223
That's why I wanted
you all to be here

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:50.258
when I have to say this.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.260
Autumn, come here.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:58.265
Autumn here has some
really exciting news,

01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.466
but before it hit the trades,

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.402
we wanted you all
to know first.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.805
She has just sold her trilogy,
"last kiss before winter,"

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:07.642
to a major film studio!

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:11.813
And guess
who has the lead role
in all three films?

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.415
Thank you, thank you.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.384
I am so proud
of both of you guys.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.586
I love you so much,
and do not forget
to include me

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.220
when you're choosing
a leading man.

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:22.323
But won't you be busy
with baby James and tom?

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:26.528
Oh, honey, I always got
a free hand for Channing Tatum.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.662
We certainly have
come a long way.

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:32.767
Oh, hang on.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.309
Hey, you're Carmen Ellis.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.410
Yes.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:44.212
Will you sign
for this please?

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.884
Thanks.
That's for you.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.586
You look even prettier
in person.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:08.870
Okay, if we're gonna do this,

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.472
we're gonna do it right,
okay?

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:12.974
Once we're done,

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.475
we're gonna burn all
the clothes that we're wearing.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:19.881
Hello?

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.551
Yes.

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:29.224
Okay. We'll be there.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:41.736
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:45.340
What's going on?

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:46.674
We have to dismember her limbs

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.309
and separate them
in different places.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.744
Carmen,
look for garbage bags.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.879
We'll have to create
a safe zone with the bags.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.400
I don't know who it is,
but they better be here quick.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:13.534
I'm sick of sitting here.

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:17.038
Hello, ladies.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.008
- It's you.
- Heh.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.844
You know, you see
a lot of crazy things

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:25.346
renting out an apartment
in Hollywood,

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:26.948
but I would have never
have expected

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.383
to have seen what I saw

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:32.420
with three innocent,
beautiful,

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:34.355
successful women
like yourselves.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.357
- The smoke alarm.
- You asshole.

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:37.692
Hey.

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:39.027
So you like
to videotape your guests?

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:40.528
You sick piece of shit.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.297
You three are the first,

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.299
and I'm not
a sick piece of shit.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:45.566
Just a desperate man,

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:47.335
no different than
the three of you.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.572
When I recognized Carmen from
her rental profile picture,

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:51.572
I thought to myself,

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:51.572
"well, maybe this
was an opportunity

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:55.710
to take care of some
financial burdens."

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:59.747
So I thought that
maybe if I caught her
walking around naked

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:03.418
or enjoying the company
of a man, well, you know.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.687
Sex tapes, they do,
oh, so well.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.555
But what I got?

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.791
Oh, man, what I got
was so much better

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.526
than anything
i could have ever imagined.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.761
You're disgusting.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.963
So why wait four months
to contact us?

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:19.767
Well, I'm a smart man,
and I know what I want.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.769
I know you got
that movie deal.

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.706
I know you're starring in it.
Congratulations.

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:28.976
I'm a nice guy,
but I'm also a businessman,

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.578
and I'm willing to get rid
of those tapes,

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.382
each and every one of them.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:36.684
And that's why we're here--

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.986
giving you three
a chance to repent,

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.822
forgive yourselves.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:43.624
And how do we do that,
you snake?

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:45.593
I think a million dollars

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.863
will help you heal
and cleanse that darkness

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.465
you've gotta be
carrying with you.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.799
Bastard.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:55.002
You can cover that.

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.638
No, I know how this works.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.941
- Oh, do you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.776
Once we pay you,
then in three more months,

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:03.044
we hear from you again

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.780
looking for more money
to keep quiet.

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:08.616
We were acting
in self-defense.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:10.451
Self-defense?

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:16.023
Mutilating,
chopping up a lifeless body,

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.159
that's self-defense?

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:20.795
You three are crazier
than I thought.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:26.734
I made you all an offer.
I keep my word.

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.605
What are you gonna do?

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:43.064
911. What's your emergency?

01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:50.470
