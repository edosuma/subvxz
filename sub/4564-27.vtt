WEBVTT

00:03.696 --> 00:05.662
( Sustained
high-pitched squeal )

00:08.275 --> 00:10.550
Okay.

00:10.585 --> 00:12.994
I'm getting the sense

00:13.030 --> 00:15.130
that you're a little excited
about something.

00:15.165 --> 00:16.923
But I'm gonna need you
to use your words.

00:16.959 --> 00:19.159
Bill told me that Steve told him

00:19.194 --> 00:20.577
that Kenny told him
that Dave told him

00:20.612 --> 00:23.689
that Greg Wilson likes you.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.416
Well, then, it must be true.

00:26.451 --> 00:30.012
Plus, he is planning
on inviting you

00:30.047 --> 00:31.947
to go away camping
for the weekend.

00:31.982 --> 00:35.267
Wait, go away camping?

00:35.302 --> 00:36.926
There's no way my parents are gonna
let me do that, but I could ask.

00:36.961 --> 00:39.279
No, you don't ask, you tell.

00:39.315 --> 00:41.197
And if that doesn't work,
you beg.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.966
And if that doesn't work,
you cry.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.201
That always gets them.

00:46.664 --> 00:49.998
Mom and Dad,

00:50.033 --> 00:53.513
this weekend, Marisa and I are going
camping with a group of friends.

00:53.628 --> 00:56.096
Uh... please let me go.

00:56.131 --> 00:57.981
I know there will be boys there,

00:58.017 --> 01:00.177
but I'm responsible
and trustworthy.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.878
( Crying )

01:02.913 --> 01:07.883
You have to let me go.
I promise.

01:07.918 --> 01:11.002
I would nPlease let me go.
To tarnish the Please. Name

01:11.037 --> 01:13.238
- It's okay with me.
- Okay, honey.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.365
Wait, that's all you got to say?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.400
Uh, watch out for deer ticks.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.293
I'm going camping
with Greg Wilson.

01:26.328 --> 01:27.894
This is gonna be
the best weekend ever.

01:27.929 --> 01:29.346
I am so happy, I could die.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.065
KC Cooper must die.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.008
Your assignment
is to eliminate her.

01:34.044 --> 01:35.127
Understood?

01:38.773 --> 01:42.117
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:42.152 --> 01:45.312
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:45.389 --> 01:49.349
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:49.384 --> 01:53.369
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:53.405 --> 01:57.073
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:57.108 --> 01:59.167
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:59.203 --> 02:03.279
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:03.314 --> 02:07.216
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:07.252 --> 02:09.285
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:09.320 --> 02:11.521
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:11.556 --> 02:13.957
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:13.993 --> 02:16.109
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:16.144 --> 02:17.953
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:17.988 --> 02:19.946
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:19.981 --> 02:22.875
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:22.910 --> 02:23.933
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:23.968 --> 02:26.336
I keep it undercover.

02:26.371 --> 02:27.971
I keep it undercover.

02:33.036 --> 02:34.756
No, it's not gonna work.

02:37.015 --> 02:40.859
Um, yes. This is perfect.

02:46.742 --> 02:48.975
Don't move.

02:49.011 --> 02:51.544
Don't say anything.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.746
Understand?

02:56.851 --> 02:59.686
CRAIG: KC? Everything
okay in there?

02:59.721 --> 03:03.940
You better say yes, or you'll
never say anything again.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.508
Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

03:08.005 --> 03:10.480
By the way, red plaid...

03:10.515 --> 03:13.734
Not as flattering
as you think it is.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.411
What'd you do, crawl out of
a hole to insult me?

03:16.447 --> 03:19.406
No. I didn't come here
to insult you.

03:19.441 --> 03:21.474
I came here to kill you.

03:21.509 --> 03:23.318
Babe.

03:28.032 --> 03:29.674
Now back in those days,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.785
we didn't have
computers in our pockets.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.945
And everything was made
with carbs and trans fats,

03:33.980 --> 03:34.687
and no one seemed to care.

03:34.723 --> 03:37.132
Oh, Agent Grandma,

03:37.209 --> 03:39.484
I could listen to
your spy stories all night long.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.203
What a coincidence.

03:41.238 --> 03:44.580
She can tell 'em all night long.

03:44.616 --> 03:46.499
Oh, wait, wait. I got another
one for you, corn chip.

03:46.534 --> 03:48.901
The year was 1977,

03:48.937 --> 03:51.037
and there was
an international dispute,

03:51.072 --> 03:53.039
and they called
your Grandma Gayle in

03:53.074 --> 03:56.318
to fix things, yes, they did.

03:56.353 --> 03:58.904
How long is your mother
staying with us?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.405
For as long as she wants, Craig.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.700
My dad's out of town, and
she's afraid to be alone.

04:03.735 --> 04:07.996
She was a spy for 40 years!

04:08.031 --> 04:09.897
She can't spend
a couple of nights alone

04:09.933 --> 04:12.333
in a luxury condominium
in a gated community?

04:12.369 --> 04:15.428
Somebody might use the
Jacuzzi after 9:00 p.m.

04:15.463 --> 04:19.307
Ah! Ahhh!

04:19.342 --> 04:22.143
One more word, Craig,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.445
and I am calling your mom
and inviting her here

04:24.480 --> 04:26.939
- for two weeks.
- No, no!

04:26.975 --> 04:29.209
Now the president
was just laying there,

04:29.244 --> 04:31.469
and I stretched out
my bare hand,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.738
and stuck it in
his chest cavity,

04:33.774 --> 04:36.949
and massaged that non-beating
heart back to life.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.370
That's an amazing story,
Agent Grandma.

04:40.406 --> 04:43.690
For the first time,
I feel like I'm talking to

04:43.726 --> 04:45.606
a real, honest-to-goodness spy.

04:45.635 --> 04:47.435
Uh, what do you call me?

04:47.471 --> 04:49.721
Desperate, needy,
stink bomb, no friends,

04:49.756 --> 04:52.173
loaded diaper.
Should I keep going?

04:52.209 --> 04:54.569
No. You've made your point.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.647
Did you come here to kill me

04:59.683 --> 05:01.566
because you found out that I was
going camping with Greg Wilson?

05:01.601 --> 05:04.018
Really, it's a group thing,

05:04.054 --> 05:05.787
and I'm surprised
he even asked me,

05:05.822 --> 05:07.289
'cause he's the shy type,

05:07.324 --> 05:09.257
which, now that
I think about it,

05:09.292 --> 05:10.675
isn't gonna work because
I'm the shy type,

05:10.710 --> 05:12.568
so you can't really
have a relationship...

05:12.604 --> 05:14.724
Are you trying to make me
squeeze this trigger?

05:16.175 --> 05:17.655
It would speed up the process.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.287
Don't worry. I'm gonna do it.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.938
( Scoffs ) Okay.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.666
I am.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.276
Whatever.

05:29.846 --> 05:31.262
I am.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.657
I am going to shoot you.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.492
I always complete my missions.

05:43.726 --> 05:45.794
Would you like me
to pull the trigger?

05:45.829 --> 05:47.328
No!

05:47.363 --> 05:50.215
I can't do this.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.407
Uh, yeah, I could've
told you that, like,

05:51.443 --> 05:52.950
forty minutes ago.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.596
You don't get it.

05:56.631 --> 05:57.864
If I don't eliminate you, the other
side is going to eliminate me.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.934
Are they?

06:00.969 --> 06:02.435
Or are they just gonna come in
my room and talk about doing it?

06:02.471 --> 06:05.789
This isn't a joke, KC.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.300
The other side is gonna send someone
to take care of both of us.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.775
They won't think twice
about finishing the job.

06:15.559 --> 06:17.600
You know, I gotta
be honest, Brett.

06:17.635 --> 06:19.101
I feel like our relationship

06:19.137 --> 06:21.538
is really messed up.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.450
KC!

06:42.486 --> 06:44.168
Are you ready to go camping?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.938
- Uh, no.
- Why?

06:46.973 --> 06:48.364
You don't have to do
your hair, put on makeup

06:48.399 --> 06:50.625
or wear nice clothes.

06:50.661 --> 06:51.901
Technically, you are always
ready to go camping.

06:51.936 --> 06:55.354
Uh...

06:55.390 --> 06:57.865
I just thought about it.
Not really into it.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.142
Not into it?
You begged us to let you go.

07:00.178 --> 07:02.462
And then, I cried.

07:02.497 --> 07:03.630
I have been
an emotional basket case.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.206
I shouldn't be going anywhere.

07:05.242 --> 07:06.733
You were so excited about this.

07:06.768 --> 07:08.309
I don't understand
what's going on.

07:08.345 --> 07:12.255
Marisa, I don't wanna go.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.474
Please, please,
don't make me go.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.711
Why can't you just accept
the fact that I'm not fun?

07:22.634 --> 07:25.552
She just told/begged/cried me.

07:25.587 --> 07:27.307
I've created a monster.

07:30.959 --> 07:33.151
KC, I want you to
pack your bag...

07:37.699 --> 07:41.501
Why is your door locked?

07:41.578 --> 07:43.536
- Get in the closet.
- MARISA: What did you say?

07:43.571 --> 07:45.531
- One second.
- What about the muffins?

07:53.331 --> 07:56.499
Why was your door locked?

07:56.534 --> 07:58.685
Do you have a boy in here?

07:58.762 --> 08:00.882
( laughs ) I'm sorry.
I just heard what I said.

08:02.874 --> 08:05.625
Marisa, what do you want?

08:05.660 --> 08:07.643
KC, why aren't you
going on this trip?

08:07.678 --> 08:08.711
Greg Wilson is the first guy
you've liked

08:08.746 --> 08:10.347
since that nightmare Brett.

08:10.382 --> 08:13.457
Remember how
broken-hearted you were?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.584
I wouldn't say
I was broken-hearted.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.661
I think that's
a little bit extreme.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.313
You cried for a week.

08:19.349 --> 08:20.565
You were all, like,
"He's bad, but he's good,"

08:20.600 --> 08:22.517
he has such beautiful hair.

08:22.552 --> 08:24.393
"I'll never find
another guy like him."

08:24.429 --> 08:27.547
( Brett chuckling )

08:27.624 --> 08:29.865
Marisa, I think you're
exaggerating a little bit.

08:29.901 --> 08:32.221
Honey, you Photoshopped
what your kids would look like.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.623
It's no secret that you were
crazy head-over-heels for...

08:37.658 --> 08:38.916
Brett!

08:38.951 --> 08:41.202
So...

08:41.238 --> 08:43.029
our kids.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.507
Do they have names?

08:45.542 --> 08:48.551
For the record,
it was only one kid.

08:48.587 --> 08:51.738
That doesn't make me seem
any less pathetic.

08:51.773 --> 08:53.306
What is he doing here?

08:53.341 --> 08:55.691
I came to eliminate her.

08:55.726 --> 08:58.427
Ha ha, but he couldn't
go through with it.

08:58.462 --> 09:01.373
Oh, okay, so he lied to you,

09:01.408 --> 09:03.583
set up your family,
tried to kill you,

09:03.618 --> 09:06.035
and now, you're protecting him?

09:06.070 --> 09:09.046
And I thought I had
lousy taste in guys.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.373
BOTH: You do.

09:16.297 --> 09:19.357
Where's my meat loaf?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.401
I ate it.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.479
I didn't know it was yours.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.273
I hid it in the
back of the fridge,

09:27.308 --> 09:28.933
wrapped in foil with
a label that said,

09:28.969 --> 09:30.935
"This is Craig's, do not eat."

09:30.971 --> 09:32.851
Next time, be a little clearer.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.681
- Hey, jalapeo.
- Hey, Agent Grandma.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.200
You know that story about how
you saved the president's life?

09:46.236 --> 09:48.327
That was August of 1977, right?

09:48.363 --> 09:50.062
Yeah. Sounds about right.

09:50.097 --> 09:53.399
Does it? Does it really?

09:53.434 --> 09:55.643
See, I did a little digging,

09:55.679 --> 09:58.604
and it turns out
you and the president

09:58.640 --> 10:00.723
were never in the same
city in August of '77.

10:00.758 --> 10:03.001
Are you accusing me
of fabricating a story

10:03.036 --> 10:04.635
to make myself look good?

10:04.670 --> 10:07.446
Please. The only
true part of that story

10:07.482 --> 10:11.225
was that there was
an August in 1977.

10:11.261 --> 10:13.577
Now listen here, kumquat,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.055
that's a whole lotta
attitude for someone

10:16.091 --> 10:18.816
who can be wiped out with a
screwdriver and a magnet.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.915
How much longer are you
gonna be in that bathroom?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.232
- Hurry up.
- Screaming "hurry up" isn't helping.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.172
Gammy's looking for you.

10:33.207 --> 10:34.582
Oh, uh, could you just tell her

10:34.618 --> 10:35.908
I'll be down there in a second?

10:35.943 --> 10:37.752
Thank you so much.

10:45.428 --> 10:48.013
Oh, I forgot to... ( gasps )

10:48.048 --> 10:49.681
Brett Willis.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.946
Let me explain.

10:56.981 --> 10:58.614
There's nothing to explain.

10:58.649 --> 11:00.800
You almost destroyed my family.

11:00.835 --> 11:02.755
Now you will be destroyed.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.524
Are you done?

11:08.559 --> 11:10.118
Not yet.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.373
Now I'm done.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.010
Thank you.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.317
What is going on?!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.728
Ernie, I'm asking you
as your sister.

11:28.763 --> 11:30.838
Please do not tell
Mom and Dad about this.

11:30.874 --> 11:33.182
You can't ask me to keep
a secret like that.

11:33.217 --> 11:35.526
My nerves can't take
that kind of stress.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.162
You can't take the stress of
sleeping without a night light.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.824
I hardly use it anymore,
and you know it.

11:41.859 --> 11:43.935
KC, I have to get out of here.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.520
This is getting
way too dangerous.

11:45.555 --> 11:47.747
- And weird.
- Look, he's right.

11:47.782 --> 11:50.516
Ernie, we need to get
him out of here.

11:50.551 --> 11:53.344
You can do this, all right?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.637
Just go downstairs, if the
coast is clear, then whistle.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.915
Okay. I can do that.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.950
I can do that.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.595
( Blowing air )

12:16.177 --> 12:18.352
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

12:21.557 --> 12:24.157
- What was that?
- I forgot that boy can't whistle. Let's go.

12:32.661 --> 12:36.254
You did the bird call, and Grandma
Gayle is sitting outside?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.329
I told you my nerves
can't handle this.

12:40.944 --> 12:41.867
CRAIG: I'm telling you,
that meatloaf had my name on it.

12:41.902 --> 12:43.336
Hide!

12:45.265 --> 12:47.415
Oh, Craig, let it go.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.809
I will not let this go.

12:49.886 --> 12:51.435
I will write my name on
every single piece of food

12:51.470 --> 12:53.028
in that refrigerator.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.297
I can't ask that old woman
to leave,

12:54.332 --> 12:56.274
but I can starve her out.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.134
You are acting like a child.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.530
You would too if someone
kept taking your pudding cups.

13:01.564 --> 13:03.489
You don't know it was her.
It could've been Ernie.

13:03.525 --> 13:07.977
Ernie. Ernie. Do you know what
happened to your dad's pudding cups?

13:08.012 --> 13:10.187
I didn't see anything. I didn't hear
anything, I didn't taste anything.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.583
I don't know anything about anything.
Gotta go. Bye!

13:15.119 --> 13:17.400
Where's my marker?
Or did your mother eat that too?

13:19.957 --> 13:21.040
Hey, Dad, I found it.

13:21.075 --> 13:23.001
Oh!

13:23.036 --> 13:25.378
KC!

13:25.413 --> 13:26.838
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.517
- What was that?
- I didn't see anything.

13:31.552 --> 13:34.044
I didn't hear anything.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.440
I don't know anything about anything.
Gotta go. Bye.

13:39.836 --> 13:42.228
We can only assume that
Brett's gone rogue,

13:42.264 --> 13:44.522
or turned by the Organization,

13:44.557 --> 13:45.948
which is no surprise,
given his past relationship

13:45.983 --> 13:47.541
with the Cooper girl.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.536
Your mission is to find them,

13:50.571 --> 13:51.979
and eliminate them both.

13:52.014 --> 13:53.948
Happily.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.558
I'm sorry, KC. As much as I
want you to have a boyfriend,

14:04.594 --> 14:06.452
I don't think Brett
is the right guy for you.

14:06.487 --> 14:07.637
What are you talking about?

14:07.672 --> 14:09.739
He is living in your closet,

14:09.774 --> 14:11.690
and sending you out
for fro-yo runs.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.368
This is not
a healthy relationship.

14:14.404 --> 14:17.021
I have wracked my brain trying to
figure out what to do with him.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.865
There is no good answer.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.291
Why doesn't he just go back
to being a spy for your side?

14:21.327 --> 14:23.803
'Cause...

14:23.838 --> 14:25.980
That is actually
a really good idea.

14:26.015 --> 14:28.015
Thank you. Now could you
say that again,

14:28.051 --> 14:30.531
and try not to sound
so shocked this time?

14:31.237 --> 14:32.761
I'm gonna go to
the Organization right now

14:32.797 --> 14:33.988
and plead his case.

14:35.716 --> 14:36.874
Thank you. Thanks, Marisa.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.459
Yeah, glad I could help.

14:38.495 --> 14:40.661
Now if only you could take my
advice about ditching overalls.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.622
Seriously. E-i, e-i, no.

14:48.029 --> 14:51.147
This is Ursula.
I've located the Cooper girl.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.463
With any luck, she'll lead me
straight to Brett Willis.

14:58.548 --> 15:02.500
Hey, Beverly!

15:02.535 --> 15:05.328
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.539
Seriously?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.166
Where'd you think I'd be on
a workday during office hours?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.642
Getting a mani-pedi?

15:11.677 --> 15:13.502
Zip lining in Costa Rica?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.930
Co-starring in
a Lionel Richie video?

15:15.965 --> 15:20.852
It's just that you guys
here at HQ work so hard.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.837
I wanted to bring you by
some homemade cookies.

15:22.872 --> 15:25.030
Is the price tag homemade, too?

15:25.065 --> 15:27.299
Uh, ha!

15:27.335 --> 15:29.460
Good catch.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.629
You should be a spy.
( raucous laughter )

15:34.091 --> 15:36.058
It's funny because...

15:36.093 --> 15:37.685
you're actually a spy.

15:37.721 --> 15:39.745
( laughter )

15:39.780 --> 15:41.013
Actually, not funny at all.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.750
What do you want?

15:44.785 --> 15:47.503
Um, I just had
a hypothetical question.

15:47.539 --> 15:49.230
So let's just say

15:49.265 --> 15:52.674
that there was an agent
who worked for the Organization,

15:52.710 --> 15:55.036
and let's just say

15:55.071 --> 15:57.613
that this agent
also happened to work for

15:57.648 --> 15:58.814
the Other Side.

15:58.849 --> 16:01.225
And let's just say

16:01.260 --> 16:03.461
that this agent was,
I don't know,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.788
ordered to, like,
kill me or something.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.776
But the agent didn't do it,

16:10.811 --> 16:12.911
because they're actually
a good guy.

16:12.947 --> 16:14.780
What would you say about
bringing him back into the fold?

16:14.815 --> 16:16.535
Hypothetically, of course.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.271
If you are talking about
Brett Willis,

16:22.348 --> 16:25.675
let's just say we'd
lock him up in a prison cell

16:25.710 --> 16:27.443
for the rest of his life.

16:27.479 --> 16:29.061
As you should!

16:31.349 --> 16:34.250
After what he did to my family?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.093
( Spits )

16:36.128 --> 16:39.121
That is what I think
of Brett Willis.

16:39.156 --> 16:41.757
KC, you need to clean that up.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.201
I don't like the boy either,
but that's just disgusting.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.265
See, first I did a windmill.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.185
And then, I did a jackhammer.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.763
And then, I took out
both the bad guys

16:55.798 --> 16:59.467
with a floating, gremlin spin.

16:59.502 --> 17:02.686
Unbelievable.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.939
Literally unbelievable.

17:04.974 --> 17:07.983
Are you saying that
I didn't go undercover

17:08.018 --> 17:10.135
in a break dancing crew

17:10.171 --> 17:12.154
to stop a company from
bulldozing a rec center?

17:12.189 --> 17:14.540
No. I'm saying it's the plot of

17:14.576 --> 17:16.517
<i>Breaking 2: Electric Boogaloo.</i>

17:16.552 --> 17:18.994
Where do you think
the movie people

17:19.029 --> 17:22.589
got the idea from, spark plug?

17:22.625 --> 17:24.725
Agent Grandma,
I say this with love.

17:24.761 --> 17:26.001
You're full of it.

17:28.356 --> 17:30.656
Everything I said is true.

17:30.692 --> 17:34.018
Fine. Then why don't you
bust some fresh moves right now?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.829
Well, I would, but...

17:36.864 --> 17:39.673
you know, I'm
a little rusty and...

17:39.708 --> 17:41.500
and old hip just ain't
what it used to be.

17:41.535 --> 17:43.552
Sure.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.305
Fine.

17:49.627 --> 17:51.710
Pop your puffs
into speaker mode.

17:51.746 --> 17:53.888
Pump up the jams.

17:53.923 --> 17:55.481
And stand back, sno-cone.

17:57.818 --> 17:58.858
( Dance music plays )

18:17.405 --> 18:20.923
Hey, Mom, what you doing?

18:20.958 --> 18:24.126
Your laundry.

18:24.162 --> 18:27.505
You know, for a girl who
wears the same outfit every day,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.340
you got a lot of dirty clothes.

18:30.551 --> 18:32.893
No!

18:32.929 --> 18:34.587
You should let me do it, Mom.

18:34.622 --> 18:35.871
You work too hard.
Let me take care of this.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.848
Oh, no. I have asked you
for three days

18:37.883 --> 18:39.992
to put these things away.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.952
If I don't take care
of things around this house,

18:41.987 --> 18:44.605
nothing will get done.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.490
Brett!

18:55.976 --> 18:57.896
Don't you put
your hands on me, boy.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.185
( Gasps ) Brett Willis?!

19:06.220 --> 19:08.179
What is he doing here?

19:13.327 --> 19:15.236
KC, did you even think
what would happen to us

19:15.271 --> 19:16.904
if the Organization
knew he was here?

19:16.939 --> 19:20.858
It's not like I invited him.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.536
Do you know what kind of danger
you put my entire family in?

19:23.571 --> 19:25.521
Guys, he put himself in danger

19:25.556 --> 19:27.632
when he didn't
complete his mission.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.917
We have to help him.

19:29.952 --> 19:31.902
No. KC, your parents are right.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.370
I can't stay here.

19:35.324 --> 19:38.292
Listen, I am so sorry
for all the trouble I've caused.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.372
Brett, wait.

19:43.407 --> 19:45.966
- KC, don't.
- Dad, I'll be fine.

19:50.698 --> 19:51.939
I can't take
the pressure anymore.

19:51.974 --> 19:54.583
It's eating away at me.

19:54.618 --> 19:56.852
KC has been hiding
Brett Willis in her room.

20:03.177 --> 20:05.803
I don't know what
I was so worried about.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.078
They didn't seem to have
an issue with it at all.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.070
KC, we have been driving
around for an hour now

20:15.105 --> 20:17.089
going over this.

20:17.124 --> 20:18.824
There is nothing left to say.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.084
I'm gonna pull over,
you're gonna get out,

20:20.119 --> 20:22.036
and that's it.

20:22.071 --> 20:24.438
No. Okay, we are
in this together.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.615
As long as you are with
me, you are in danger.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.342
I think you're being
overly dramatic.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.317
Am I? Am I really?

20:36.269 --> 20:38.802
So I'm guessing she's an
agent from the Other Side.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.030
Yeah.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.556
Uh, her name is Ursula,
and technically,

20:42.591 --> 20:45.025
she's kinda my girlfriend.

20:47.104 --> 20:48.970
Your girlfriend?

20:49.006 --> 20:50.105
Your girlfriend?!

20:50.140 --> 20:52.441
Are you telling me

20:52.476 --> 20:54.676
that you have been
dating someone,

20:54.712 --> 20:56.053
and you didn't even
have the decency

20:56.088 --> 20:57.955
to tell me about it?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.049
Look, I know we're not
necessarily a thing,

21:00.084 --> 21:01.008
but you could've at least
mentioned it.

21:01.044 --> 21:02.809
Oh, really?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.278
Then what about you
and Greg Wilson

21:04.313 --> 21:06.513
and all that
red flannel, huh? Huh?

21:09.626 --> 21:11.386
At least Greg Wilson
isn't trying to kill us.

21:22.189 --> 21:23.822
Know what? Enough is enough.

21:23.857 --> 21:25.441
What are you gonna do?

21:25.476 --> 21:28.126
Use my training.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.002
Kids, don't try this at home.

21:31.849 --> 21:34.033
KC. What are you doing?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.082
Yo, woman,
watch where you're going.

21:59.117 --> 21:59.983
You're gonna kill somebody.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.393
That's kind of the idea.

22:11.905 --> 22:13.230
You work for the Other Side,

22:13.265 --> 22:14.732
you're a killer, and you litter?

22:14.767 --> 22:16.167
I don't know
what Brett sees in you.

22:19.196 --> 22:20.621
KC, look out!

22:23.659 --> 22:24.750
No!!

22:30.632 --> 22:32.974
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
