02:25.187 --> 02:27.272
Hey! Buddy.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.150
Buddy, come here.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.694
Hey Buddy.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.685
What are you doing all the way out here?

02:34.780 --> 02:37.407
All alone, aw Buddy.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.160
Good boy.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.288
Buddy

02:46.750 --> 02:48.210
What is this stuff?

03:00.138 --> 03:02.140
What the fuck, ah!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.328
Mom, there's a noise out' my window.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.971
Simon...

04:52.285 --> 04:53.914
I'll be up in a minute.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.223
Aunt Joanne.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.106
Did your mother ignore you?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.566
Yes...

05:16.274 --> 05:18.193
Did you have a bad dream?

05:21.572 --> 05:22.656
Get in.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.578
There was a noise out' my window

05:28.370 --> 05:30.581
There's nothing to be afraid about out here.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.667
See?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.744
Any news on the cell tower?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.485
The tower's still out.

06:10.514 --> 06:13.450
Frank was supposed to be at it over night,
but was a no-show.

06:13.450 --> 06:14.971
Bill's on his way out there now.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.970
Sending crap signal.

06:17.857 --> 06:20.714
The town will kill him if he doesn't
get it up and running soon.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.591
You wanna head out there on your way?

06:23.175 --> 06:24.384
Yeah, okay.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.344
Joanne...

06:25.469 --> 06:26.470
I can hear you!

06:26.803 --> 06:27.971
Barely though.

06:28.764 --> 06:29.806
I made coffee...

06:29.932 --> 06:30.807
Did you just say..

06:30.974 --> 06:32.351
Joanne!

06:34.228 --> 06:37.147
Jo'... hello?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.333
Hey, Luke.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.086
What's going on?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.588
Cell tower is out.

07:02.257 --> 07:03.540
Great.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.885
Oh hey, the movers rang yesterday.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.595
They're all good to Saturday.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.742
Oh, come on.

07:10.742 --> 07:12.432
It'll be fine, you'll see.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.184
The city's a great place.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.229
Doesn't have our dirt.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.657
No it doesn't...

07:20.970 --> 07:22.485
... but it has a university.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.570
So you can become a teacher,
instead of helping out all the time.

07:25.696 --> 07:29.241
And will give Simon all the choices
he needs to be whatever he wants.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.286
This town is not going anywhere.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.996
I came back, didn't I?

07:34.580 --> 07:36.957
You came back 'cause your
sister got knocked up.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.001
Best thing I ever did!

08:19.666 --> 08:20.918
Hey Jo'.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.129
We have an earthquake or a storm over night?

08:24.290 --> 08:26.857
We're just trying to keep you
in town a bit longer.

08:29.885 --> 08:33.931
Nah, no storms strong enough to
do this without us feeling it.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.558
Can't see any evidence of an earthquake.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.062
Angela's the one to ask though.

08:41.809 --> 08:44.400
I haven't seen or heard anything
from her this morning.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.057
Her or Frank, you?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.571
What do you mean "Not strong enough to do this"?

08:51.448 --> 08:55.244
Something strong enough to do this
would have taken out half the town with it.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.122
Looks like it was done deliberately.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.334
Can you fix it?

09:03.290 --> 09:04.800
Fix it?
We need a new one.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.258
I've put in an emergency call
already this morning.

09:09.842 --> 09:14.221
They'll kick over a satelite for us until we find
someone to come out here and fix it, but...

09:14.847 --> 09:17.808
... that'll take half a day,
or a day, at least.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.991
You didn't hurt yourself,
did you?

09:35.367 --> 09:36.493
Nah.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.790
What the hell is that?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.178
Got your radio out?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.430
Yeah.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.309
Nice to have a little bit of drama
before you pass that badge over.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.060
I could do without.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.730
How 'bout a bit of comedy?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.316
Hey, Jo'!

10:07.441 --> 10:09.193
You trying to make me turn around?

10:09.318 --> 10:10.444
No.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.070
Are you sure?

10:12.321 --> 10:13.155
No.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.744
Time for coffee but not time to fix the tower?

11:00.860 --> 11:04.057
-Oh, it sounds like you need a coffee, grumpy.
-Wantin' one.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.999
You're not wantin' one.
Get stuffed.

11:13.342 --> 11:14.371
Any news?

11:14.420 --> 11:17.228
No, we're gonna have to go
old fashioned for a day or so, I think.

11:17.314 --> 11:19.300
That's all we do around here anyway.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.971
You didn't notice anything?

11:21.020 --> 11:23.342
Hear anything out of the ordinary,
a distant dust-storm...

11:23.475 --> 11:26.854
There was a giant "thud"
in the early hours, and...

11:26.979 --> 11:30.107
... a couple of things fell off the shelf
in the kitchen, but that's it.

11:31.108 --> 11:34.486
You know,
this doesn't look like a storm.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.857
Better get Luke a coffee,
think we're gonna need it.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.308
Buddy?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.114
It looked like I saw...

12:27.080 --> 12:29.291
So, Sammy finished her packing yet?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.877
Not yet,
she's in no hurry.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.464
You just gotta let her get used to it,
that's all, I mean...

12:35.589 --> 12:39.885
Your family has lived in this town for...
I dunno... forever.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.847
Your parents loved it here,
like, more than most.

12:44.771 --> 12:50.314
I don't see why it's so hard for everyone to understand,
being here makes me miss them, and that pisses me off.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.523
Well I'll miss you.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.236
Anthony on some morning walkabouts now?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.987
Better not be.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.740
Anthony.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.117
Anthony!

13:04.785 --> 13:06.286
Where's he going?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.885
Jesus...

13:22.219 --> 13:23.470
What is that?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.307
Is that Anthony's dog?

13:27.683 --> 13:30.394
Oh god, what happened to it?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.355
Attacked?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.342
Oh, what the hell are those things,
sticking out of it's neck?

13:44.990 --> 13:48.228
I don't want anyone to touch that,
I'm gonna get the doctor to have a look at it.

13:48.314 --> 13:50.330
Yeah, you do that.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.178
Careful with the telescope.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.973
Why is Anthony looking so weird.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.282
Hey, Joanne!

14:27.284 --> 14:28.952
What's Anthony doing?

14:31.830 --> 14:32.998
No idea.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.375
Has Mary made any apple pie yet?

14:35.501 --> 14:38.170
You got two feet and a heartbeat,
Why don't you go and ask her?

14:38.342 --> 14:41.280
You guys wanna do something today,
instead of wasting time up there?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.210
No.

14:43.142 --> 14:46.228
Can I ask if you saw anything strange
happening to Anthony's dog this morning?

14:46.340 --> 14:48.142
No, but Murph's been weird.

14:48.314 --> 14:48.914
When?

14:49.014 --> 14:51.183
All morning.
Why?

14:52.351 --> 14:53.936
Just keep an eye on him, okay?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.648
Anything suspicious, you call me or the doc.
Don't deal with it yourselves.

14:58.190 --> 15:02.228
And I don't know why you all have to keep hanging out
up there, that balcony is hanging on by a thread.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.988
That's all I need, a dead teenager,
a week before I leave.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.534
Well, hate to disappoint you but,
We're not teenagers anymore.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.828
I cannot believe you're the next generation.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.167
Go on, have a throw.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.758
Uh, what does this button do?

15:25.884 --> 15:26.969
Careful!

15:27.094 --> 15:29.012
Shit, sorry.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.342
It's beautiful, girls.

15:32.114 --> 15:34.140
Look at that pink hair.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.896
Got a way until finished.
What about now?

15:38.828 --> 15:40.690
-Wanna try this?
-No.

15:42.314 --> 15:45.085
Well, we might have to finish inside.
You guys ready to go in?

15:45.153 --> 15:47.322
You got everything?
Okay, let's go.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.534
Pack it all up.
Who needs to go to the bathroom before we go?

15:50.659 --> 15:52.119
You two?
Okay.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.079
We'll be in the library.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.374
Oh, here,
let me take this, Alright.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.042
-Jump down. Got all that?
-Yeah.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.087
And bring something from the game room.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.549
How is he?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.717
He's alright.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.928
Aren't you boy?
Murphy.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.388
Murph, you okay?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.171
I don't know,
seems a bit weird.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.644
He hasn't eaten this morning.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.354
Nothing.

17:00.914 --> 17:03.285
It's weird.
Alright boy?

17:03.941 --> 17:05.858
Is there any more sign of what you saw?

17:09.445 --> 17:13.575
Why didn't you say anything?
Joanne's harmless on the inside.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.428
Just... has a bit of a temper is all.

17:17.171 --> 17:18.369
But we all know that.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.041
Well, wasn't sure she was gonna believe me.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.216
What's wrong with him?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.355
Is Anthony stoned or what?

17:47.192 --> 17:49.361
Shit, where did he come from?

17:51.989 --> 17:54.366
They look fucked up, right?

19:14.488 --> 19:17.866
Oh jeez, bet you wish
you were back in the city now.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.327
Nope, can't say I do.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.621
Nothing ever happens in the city anyway.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.415
This is the most fun I've had in years.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.301
We're gonna need a lot more
than coffee to get us through today.

19:36.802 --> 19:40.597
What the hell is bill doing out there?
Powers out now?

19:42.390 --> 19:45.742
Alright, I'm gonna contact Beacons County.
Let them know what's happening.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.981
Maybe they can hurry up with moving that satelite.

19:49.085 --> 19:51.657
You know someone who can
move a satelite in a hurry, do you?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.000
God I hope so.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.971
-You seen doc?
-No, why?

19:56.280 --> 20:00.367
I found Anthonys dog dead at the diner
this morning, practically butchered.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.314
Whatever killed it was pretty nasty.

20:02.360 --> 20:06.971
Let's put an alert out for any wild animals and, um...
I'll see if I can get the doc to confirm it.

20:07.342 --> 20:09.942
-Yeah? Registered that?
-I registered.
-Good.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.141
Bill?

20:24.910 --> 20:25.742
Oh...

20:26.640 --> 20:28.314
Would help if I turned it on.

20:29.313 --> 20:32.024
I have not used this in a long time.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.776
Bill?

20:36.320 --> 20:37.321
Bill?

20:38.322 --> 20:39.489
Come in, Bill?

20:40.991 --> 20:42.075
Bill?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.495
Oh my god,
this thing's archaic.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.685
Bill?

20:48.457 --> 20:49.200
Bill?

20:51.742 --> 20:52.714
Bill?

20:53.712 --> 20:54.963
Come in, Bill?

21:26.514 --> 21:28.314
What are you looking at, Simon?

21:28.789 --> 21:30.332
Mr. Barter.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.391
Why is Mr. Barter standing like that?

21:47.933 --> 21:49.142
I'm not sure.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.487
Bill, are you okay?

22:05.951 --> 22:06.994
Bill?

22:07.744 --> 22:09.830
He's got blood on his hands.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.634
What happened, Bill?

22:29.725 --> 22:31.351
What happened to your hands?

23:15.062 --> 23:17.022
What's the matter with her?

23:20.359 --> 23:22.486
You're both gonna wanna see this.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.114
You go.

23:26.323 --> 23:28.492
I don't have time for crazy shit this morning.

23:28.650 --> 23:33.057
If anything you can come out to the power station and take a look for us, we can't find Frank or Bill.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.248
Okay.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.791
What did you find?

23:46.460 --> 23:48.514
How long did you say this has been here?

23:48.846 --> 23:51.348
It wasn't here yesterday.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.518
A meteor?

23:54.768 --> 23:57.521
Nope, can't see anyone of those.

24:00.399 --> 24:01.567
What then?

24:02.526 --> 24:04.236
That is solid rock.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.780
Solid, solid rock.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.242
Yet something has made this indent.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.245
I'm a geologist,
I know my rocks.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.707
How did you even find this?

24:17.330 --> 24:20.685
You don't think after all these years,
I don't know every distinctive rock?

24:21.170 --> 24:24.506
This area is precious,
you don't see that?

24:25.257 --> 24:26.842
What's your theory then?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.628
I don't know which one is more fucked up...

24:32.639 --> 24:36.101
... finding this, or your excitement
if it did fall out of the sky.

24:36.390 --> 24:40.057
Are you sure it's not just something from
when they used to blow nuclear shit out here?

24:40.105 --> 24:43.817
If that's nuclear,
we are fucked.

24:45.611 --> 24:47.029
Relax.

24:47.196 --> 24:51.158
It's not nuclear, although,
that is definitely unknown metallic.

24:54.070 --> 24:57.628
Until we get communications up,
I'll just secure the area the best way I can.

24:57.742 --> 24:58.657
Good idea.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.793
The last thing we need are
those teenagers down here, bored.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.837
Teenagers?
What are you, like 80?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.923
I wanna get us to the power station.

25:06.048 --> 25:09.760
Can you at least pretend like this is
the most amazing thing you've ever seen.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.179
This is me, pretending.

25:44.461 --> 25:48.215
Mom, is that... Sunday's scarf?

25:51.960 --> 25:54.114
They haven't come back from the bathroom yet.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.971
Mom, don't go!

25:58.517 --> 25:59.852
Miss Sharp.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.021
Miss Sharp, he's leaving.

26:11.655 --> 26:13.949
Where did Mr. Barter go?

26:14.908 --> 26:17.035
Remember, not a sound.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.051
Speed, speed kids.

26:40.970 --> 26:42.571
Mom, I'm scared.

26:42.628 --> 26:43.890
I know, Simon.

26:44.271 --> 26:45.606
Stay quiet.

26:48.442 --> 26:49.776
Get in here kids.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.342
Could someone have done this on purpose?

26:55.532 --> 26:58.785
How on earth could someone stop
a power station from working?

26:59.912 --> 27:01.955
Nothing seems out of place.

27:02.485 --> 27:06.257
-So both cell towers are out and no power?
-Bill sorts it out when he gets here.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.378
Where the hell is he anyway?

27:08.504 --> 27:09.880
And Frank?

27:28.941 --> 27:30.817
Angela, what is that?

27:31.318 --> 27:33.946
Anthony's dog was found
the same way this morning.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.325
Don't get too close.

27:38.450 --> 27:41.203
Looks like a wild animal's got to it.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.705
It's got those spikes though.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.700
Yeah.

27:46.500 --> 27:50.462
Can you bag that for me? And take it to the doc
before you head out to the rocks again?

27:50.921 --> 27:51.880
Sure.

27:52.047 --> 27:53.841
-You got you CB-radio out?
-Yeah.

27:56.009 --> 27:58.971
Sorry I couldn't be more help,
but, I don't see anything wrong.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.282
Okay, see that door?

28:18.699 --> 28:22.202
We're gonna keep this door shut until
me or the sergeant gets back. Okay?

28:22.327 --> 28:23.662
And you stick together.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.831
You need a weapon, miss Sharp.

28:30.711 --> 28:32.003
Thank you, Katie.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.006
It's okay, you hold onto this...

28:34.131 --> 28:36.842
... and keep that safe and...
I might use that later.

29:41.657 --> 29:42.699
Shit.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.919
Joanne?

29:55.921 --> 29:58.507
Joanne?
Joanne, please come in.

29:59.090 --> 30:03.171
Look, Harry, if you really wanna help,
get in your car and drive out there.

30:03.170 --> 30:06.914
Because we can't find Frank or Bill, and you telling
us what we already know, it's not helping.

30:07.028 --> 30:10.010
Just make sure your generator works,
and get your radio out.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.085
That's all we need people to do right now.

30:12.170 --> 30:17.085
This sort of thing, it happens out here from time to time,
but it eventually gets sorted out, we know that.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.487
I thought that's why you all love living out here.
No communication.

30:21.400 --> 30:25.714
That's very fine, but then where is everybody?
I haven't seen half the town this morning, and...

30:25.740 --> 30:26.885
... look at this.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.746
I found it on my porch an hour ago.

30:30.289 --> 30:31.623
Why are you showing me that?

30:32.828 --> 30:35.514
Don't expose that in here Harry,
what's wrong with you?

30:36.503 --> 30:39.715
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're going, soon enough...

30:39.800 --> 30:41.910
... you're not gonna get replaced any time soon...

30:41.967 --> 30:44.636
... Luke, he's gonna be here for another decade or so.

30:46.180 --> 30:49.600
Oh, I see what's going on here,
you're missing me already, that's what this is.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.257
Harry, do us a favor and
get that to the doc will you, please.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.228
The Doc?

30:53.353 --> 30:56.773
Do you feel like dealing with
a disease that wipes out our livestock?

30:56.890 --> 30:59.257
From what I can tell there's been 3 or 4 animals already...

30:59.280 --> 31:02.400
... so that means there must be a whole
lot more we don't even know about.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.028
Fine.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.828
Someone's gotta do something about the power...

31:05.857 --> 31:09.485
... and they're fine with us start driving around and finding it, when hell, everyone bloody willies.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.412
Oy!

31:11.747 --> 31:14.666
Joanne? Joanne, please come in.

31:16.971 --> 31:18.028
Harry...

31:18.114 --> 31:21.630
... can you please get that bloody rabbit,
to the bloody doctor, right now?

31:25.636 --> 31:27.095
Fuck my lunch!

31:27.221 --> 31:28.263
Joanne?

31:29.014 --> 31:30.057
Jo'?

31:30.891 --> 31:32.726
Joanne, please come in.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.971
-Samantha?
-There's blood all over Bills hands, something's wrong.

31:36.970 --> 31:38.485
Bill Barter?

31:38.607 --> 31:40.651
I was with Bill this morning,
Hey, hey!

31:40.776 --> 31:41.777
Sam?

31:42.236 --> 31:44.738
Sunday and Albert are trapped somewhere.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.658
I have to look for them,
I can't leave the kids.

31:49.243 --> 31:50.369
Samantha?

31:51.160 --> 31:54.514
Listen, stay with the kids,
don't approach him, I'm on my way.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.759
Why is it so deserted?

32:07.710 --> 32:10.885
-There's nothing fucking normal about any of this.
-I know.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.351
Look we need to stay on
our radios, be calm, and alert.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.603
What happened to Anthony?

32:18.063 --> 32:19.439
This doesn't feel right.

32:19.565 --> 32:20.816
No it doesn't.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.568
I gotta get to the school.

32:23.068 --> 32:24.903
Why don't you check on Anthony?

32:57.603 --> 32:58.645
Bill?

33:00.022 --> 33:03.025
Why are you scaring Samantha?
Bill?

33:03.859 --> 33:05.277
What are you doing here?

33:09.656 --> 33:10.657
Bill?

33:20.125 --> 33:22.377
What the fuck is happening, Bill?

33:23.879 --> 33:25.756
I want the other one.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.176
What did you say?

33:32.137 --> 33:34.056
Do you not have the other one?

33:35.849 --> 33:37.267
The other what?

33:40.604 --> 33:42.773
I want... the boy now.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.825
I just want you to wait here for a minute, okay?

33:54.451 --> 33:55.494
Bill?

34:07.673 --> 34:09.132
Fuck.

34:15.010 --> 34:17.771
-Go back inside Sam!
-How'd you get the kids inside?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.603
What is going on, Joanne?

34:24.523 --> 34:26.692
I don't know,
go back inside.

34:27.734 --> 34:30.152
Not without them, please Jo'.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.993
Wait, around the corner.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.954
Wait here, until I tell you what to do.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.384
Samantha, stay back!
Do it.

35:41.558 --> 35:43.143
Did you do that?

35:50.901 --> 35:53.153
Stop there! Stop.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.697
Don't take another step.

35:57.658 --> 35:58.992
Turn around.

36:00.702 --> 36:02.538
Turn around and get on the ground.

36:04.456 --> 36:05.707
Please, Bill.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.960
Turn around!

36:16.343 --> 36:19.054
Jo', please.
What did he do?

36:23.350 --> 36:24.560
Miss Sharp...

36:25.352 --> 36:27.855
It's Albert, I'm gonna get him.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.439
Yeah!

36:38.907 --> 36:40.158
Albert?

36:41.326 --> 36:42.619
Sunday?

37:27.414 --> 37:28.665
Albert?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.463
It's miss Sharp.

37:36.590 --> 37:37.925
Where are you?

37:46.517 --> 37:48.852
Albert, Albert.

37:49.269 --> 37:52.689
Close your eyes sweetie,
I got you.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.859
Good boy, good boy.

37:55.984 --> 37:58.320
Keep your eyes closed,
nice and tight.

38:06.411 --> 38:07.663
How many kids?

38:07.996 --> 38:09.081
3.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.835
Sam, no one goes near that toilet block.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.548
They just kept staring at us Jo'.

38:21.093 --> 38:22.386
What happened?

38:25.013 --> 38:26.139
How could he do that?

38:28.016 --> 38:30.853
How could he do that to his own daughter?

38:32.813 --> 38:34.439
Hey, hey!

38:34.565 --> 38:38.235
Gather all the kids in the car,
and get to the station, yeah?

38:38.652 --> 38:43.574
He's sick, I'm isolating Bill to the old jail.
No one goes near that block.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.075
Yes

38:47.995 --> 38:48.996
Yeah.

39:08.557 --> 39:09.850
Anthony?

39:12.477 --> 39:13.645
Anthony?

39:16.231 --> 39:17.858
Anthony, can you hear?

39:21.403 --> 39:22.529
You hurt?

39:29.171 --> 39:29.971
Psst.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.885
Where the fuck are you?

39:48.263 --> 39:52.226
Paul, Paul.
Where did Anthony go?

39:52.643 --> 39:53.852
I dunno.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.605
We can't get down,
someone's jammed the door.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.828
We don't want them to hear us, so we've been up here
being quiet, waiting for someone normal to pass.

40:22.250 --> 40:26.171
-Yeah, just what we meant when we said being quiet.
-Be careful!

41:59.350 --> 42:00.685
Hey, can you hear me?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.257
Is it still stuck?

42:02.270 --> 42:03.714
The doors blocked, hang on.

42:04.142 --> 42:05.520
Can you hurry up?

42:06.860 --> 42:08.612
Please don't leave us here!

42:09.530 --> 42:10.989
Please don't leave us!

42:14.530 --> 42:18.600
-We have to find our families.
-Yes, get in, stay together, we have no idea what's happening out there.

42:18.770 --> 42:19.828
Don't worry about us.

42:20.123 --> 42:21.834
Make sure you stay together.

44:37.928 --> 44:39.096
Luke...

44:40.050 --> 44:42.771
-Marsha, what are you doing in here?
-Just get in here.

44:45.561 --> 44:48.939
Anthony grabbed me, and I mean like,
he really grabbed me.

44:49.064 --> 44:51.567
I pushed him back, and...

44:51.900 --> 44:53.652
... I swear to god he was gonna kill me.

44:53.777 --> 44:56.029
Okay, so I ran,
and I tried to get to the station.

44:56.780 --> 45:00.325
I came in here, and I barricaded the doors,
but, they followed me.

45:00.450 --> 45:02.057
Okay, let's get you to the station.

45:02.114 --> 45:04.450
-No.
-Marsha, you cannot stay here, come on.

45:05.330 --> 45:09.042
Luke, it's Anthony,
please, don't hurt him.

45:15.465 --> 45:16.216
Get back.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.469
-Anthony, get back.
-Luke!

45:20.721 --> 45:21.889
Anthony, get back!

45:38.071 --> 45:40.490
Don't! No, no!
Don't! Don't!

45:55.589 --> 45:56.590
Luke!

46:12.689 --> 46:14.900
Where did they all come from?

46:31.166 --> 46:34.169
I've never seen anything like this before.

47:06.952 --> 47:08.871
This is all wrong.

48:08.096 --> 48:09.890
What the hell is he doing?

48:23.862 --> 48:25.239
Oh, shit.

48:43.507 --> 48:45.759
Where the fuck did he go?

49:43.609 --> 49:44.693
Dean?

49:47.070 --> 49:48.906
What's wrong with your face?

49:53.160 --> 49:54.494
What's happening?

49:57.539 --> 49:58.540
Dean!

51:20.414 --> 51:21.957
Oh god, Francis.

52:08.754 --> 52:09.922
Shit.

52:10.631 --> 52:15.135
He barely had time to think, let alone kill her
like that. The strength that would take.

52:15.420 --> 52:18.400
And the school, I couldn't even tell
what was left of little Sunday.

52:18.430 --> 52:21.350
I just can not believe Bill did that,
it's not possible.

52:23.977 --> 52:25.145
Dean.

52:28.899 --> 52:30.317
Hey, Dean?

52:37.057 --> 52:38.770
Look, I'm just gonna...

52:41.286 --> 52:42.079
Let her go.

52:43.664 --> 52:45.082
Dean, let her go.

52:45.374 --> 52:47.084
Dean, let... her go.

52:52.714 --> 52:53.841
Joanne?

53:01.807 --> 53:02.850
You okay?

53:10.399 --> 53:12.484
What the fuck was that?

53:17.823 --> 53:19.283
What the hell is that?

53:23.287 --> 53:24.580
Where's it gone?

53:24.830 --> 53:26.957
Joanne, what the fuck did we just see?

53:27.541 --> 53:29.793
I don't know what we just saw.

53:30.210 --> 53:32.114
What the fuck are they doing?

53:39.657 --> 53:41.314
-Luke
-Run, run!

53:43.430 --> 53:44.485
My car.

53:49.688 --> 53:51.857
Dean is gone!

53:56.320 --> 53:59.057
-Fuck! There's more.
- How many of them are there?

53:59.948 --> 54:01.366
How do they run like that?

54:01.490 --> 54:04.400
Look out, look out!
Stop stop stop stop!

54:07.581 --> 54:08.957
Hang on to that baby.

54:11.830 --> 54:14.857
-Joanne, what the fuck is going on here?
-I don't know!

54:15.080 --> 54:16.857
Shit! Go!

54:19.384 --> 54:21.094
Where the fuck did he come from?

54:23.347 --> 54:24.181
Fuck!

54:27.850 --> 54:31.628
-This is fucking crazy Joanne, we need help!
-We don't have time for help.

55:32.415 --> 55:36.420
What ever this is, I don't think
it originated from here.

55:37.796 --> 55:40.424
I can't help...
I'm.. I'm just a doctor.

55:40.549 --> 55:43.260
For a doc you're doing great.
Really!

55:43.427 --> 55:44.970
Come on, let's get you out of here.

55:46.972 --> 55:48.724
Let me keep working.

55:49.183 --> 55:52.728
The more we know, about this...
this first intake...

55:53.937 --> 55:56.273
-The better chance we've got health-wise.
-Yeah.

56:24.384 --> 56:25.969
Luke, wait.

56:39.650 --> 56:40.651
Bill?

56:42.903 --> 56:44.530
Bill, can you answer me?

56:49.159 --> 56:51.370
Can you tell me what happened this morning?

56:52.663 --> 56:53.664
Bill?

57:05.717 --> 57:07.177
Be careful.

57:11.431 --> 57:13.350
Can you tell me what happened, Bill?

57:17.771 --> 57:18.814
Joanne...

57:20.107 --> 57:21.191
I'm here.

57:28.907 --> 57:30.075
Joanne?

57:33.078 --> 57:34.580
What did I do?

57:40.544 --> 57:42.045
What did I do?

57:43.839 --> 57:45.257
What did I do?

57:48.510 --> 57:51.763
Can you tell me what happened to you
before you got to the school?

57:54.183 --> 57:55.976
Before, Bill?

57:58.478 --> 58:00.230
What did it do to me?

58:02.274 --> 58:03.609
Who's "it"?

58:04.443 --> 58:06.153
Inside my head.

58:08.071 --> 58:09.615
They killed her.

58:13.285 --> 58:18.832
They didn't kill Sunday this morning, Bill.
You did.

58:29.510 --> 58:31.345
Can you tell us anything...

58:31.678 --> 58:34.097
... that will help us deal with what's happening?

58:34.765 --> 58:37.559
Cause something is making our people sick.

58:37.726 --> 58:39.978
The same thing that happened to you.

58:44.983 --> 58:46.610
They want...

58:47.861 --> 58:49.613
They wanted me to do it...

58:51.365 --> 58:54.952
Did I do that, Joanne?
Did I?

58:55.077 --> 58:56.328
Who's "they"?

58:58.940 --> 58:59.857
Don't...

59:00.057 --> 59:02.080
No, fuck!
Don't! Don't!

59:02.209 --> 59:03.335
Stop. Stop!

59:08.882 --> 59:10.676
Ugh.. my head.

59:16.890 --> 59:18.475
I'm so muddled...

59:21.812 --> 59:23.939
I couldn't stop myself.

59:26.149 --> 59:30.279
I knew, Joanne, I knew what
I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

59:31.071 --> 59:32.656
It's my little girl.

59:39.872 --> 59:42.624
Please, stop me, Joanne.

59:42.740 --> 59:47.371
Do it now, please Joanne,
stop me now, just do it!

59:57.639 --> 59:59.600
I killed her real quick.

01:00:03.562 --> 01:00:05.397
I snapped her neck.

01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:19.542
We need to get everyone together, and gather as many
resources as we can, to last the weekend at least.

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:26.960
Okay, gather any weapons we've got,
and get everyone back to the station.

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:29.129
What about him?

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:32.549
Let's just make sure that he stays here.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:08.252
Kids, we're gonna have
to find our own way out.

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:25.394
Anybody there?

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.106
Anybody?

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.277
Come on, fuck...
Someone?

01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:35.279
Yeah, yeah, I got you,
I got you, I'm here.

01:01:35.404 --> 01:01:37.781
Can you see anything else,
or just the storm?

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:41.034
Hello?
Angela, can you hear me?

01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:41.910
What is it?

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:47.028
Angela's trying to leave, she's at the border of Beacons
county, but the road is blocked by a dust-storm.

01:01:47.114 --> 01:01:48.685
You've got to be kidding me!

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.914
Luke?
Luke, are you in?

01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:56.091
Hey, what are you seeing?

01:01:56.425 --> 01:01:57.426
Joanne...

01:01:57.634 --> 01:02:01.847
It's fucking huge.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:04.600
I stopped right in front of it.
It's a wall.

01:02:04.725 --> 01:02:07.644
Stopping anything from getting in, or out.

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:11.273
How do you know?
What happens if you drive through it?

01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:12.482
Don't...

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:14.526
I'm not sure it's gonna let me.

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:16.945
Why were you leaving town?

01:02:17.446 --> 01:02:19.198
I went back to the rocks.

01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:22.534
That silver fucking liquid,
it's crazy man.

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:25.954
I swear to god, Joanne.
I don't think it's from earth.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:28.415
I think I'm gonna go through it.

01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:32.971
Don't assume the craziest idea first,
This could have come from anywhere.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:34.880
Angela, are you listening?

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.142
-Did she just say she was gonna drive through it?
-Yeah.

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.971
Don't open the door!
Lock it!

01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:08.914
Hurry!

01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.636
Shit!
Get down!

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:32.396
Get down!
Get down!

01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:33.624
What are you seeing?

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.503
Nothing...
Just dust.

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:40.714
You're still not through it yet?

01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.550
I think I see the exit.

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.652
It's not letting us through.

01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:03.987
I drove through it,
but I didn't go anywhere.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:08.325
What the hell is that?

01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:11.912
Come back in now, Angela.
Do you hear me?

01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:14.665
Angela, answer me!

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:15.582
Fuck!

01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:18.877
What the fuck is that sound?
Is that the storm coming?

01:05:18.942 --> 01:05:23.885
Now what storm is playing out in Beacons county that's
big enough to block a road, but we get nothing here?

01:05:23.942 --> 01:05:24.630
I dunno.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.200
And what does it have to do with
all the people running around out there.

01:05:27.219 --> 01:05:32.182
I don't know, but I still can't get through to anyone in
Beacons, or the next two towns either side of us.

01:05:32.348 --> 01:05:33.225
We're shut in.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.935
And that thing?

01:05:36.103 --> 01:05:37.771
I'm gonna go find Angela.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.447
Angela!

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:51.326
Angela!

01:05:52.953 --> 01:05:54.204
Angela!

01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:09.636
We're so fucked!

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:19.980
What are you gonna do?

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.817
I have no idea, but I'm not
telling the rest of the town that.

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:27.988
It's like their focus is just on killing us.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.428
What could do that to a brain?
And so fast?

01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:36.455
We don't have time or
resources to work out "why".

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:39.166
We need to work out who's sick,
and lock them up with Bill.

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:42.252
What ever this is,
this could be completely curable.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.965
So we keep to not shooting anyone,
unless we have to.

01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:01.438
And who are you gonna shoot with those?

01:07:01.813 --> 01:07:05.400
Half the bloody town's gone mad.
You're just gonna kill our families, yeah?

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.571
What if it was one of us?

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:11.990
We're not shooting anybody, but lets be clear, these people
are capable of doing the worst things we can imagine.

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:13.951
Dean just... killed his wife.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:17.314
And you killed him before we even
had a chance to understand what this is.

01:07:17.457 --> 01:07:20.200
-Except she didn't have a choice.
-There's always a choice.

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:25.295
Dean would never have killed Francis,
everybody here knows that.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.297
And sick, or not sick,
he did kill her.

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:30.425
The same as Bill...
killing Sunday.

01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:32.219
Help is on it's way, right?

01:07:33.554 --> 01:07:37.599
We've sent distress-calls, we're sure one of them
got through before the lines got jammed.

01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:40.978
We're just not sure when they're gonna get here.
Angela nearly died trying to leave.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.142
Don't attempt it, okay?
We've lost enough already.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:49.903
Look guys, we're safer in numbers,
so just stay inside and be smart.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.447
Alright?

01:07:54.116 --> 01:07:55.325
What is it, Michelle?

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.162
I... I saw something.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.085
What do you mean you "saw something"?
What? When?

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:06.670
Through my telescope,
this morning... it...

01:08:07.087 --> 01:08:09.381
It was when the sun just came up,
so I wasn't sure.

01:08:09.771 --> 01:08:13.142
Michelle, what do you think you saw?
Nothing's gonna seem crazy right now.

01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:15.760
Something fell to the earth...

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.514
It was...

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:21.341
... a long fireball, not that big.
Like an egg.

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:24.479
And then a second one,
but without the fire.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:28.657
You see something like that, and you don't
think to report that as soon as possible?

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:34.285
A fireball for christs sake, that could have burned half the town
and the landing alone, no matter what or where it came from.

01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:36.742
I wanted to tell you,
but I wasn't sure.

01:08:36.992 --> 01:08:38.076
You sure now?

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:42.456
I'm not gonna stand here
and deal with this, so.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.671
We need to get to the doc.

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:56.428
Doc?

01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:59.973
It's incredible.
Incredible!

01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:02.267
Come on,
take a look!

01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:07.898
It's an infection, one designed to live in ant colonies.

01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:09.608
You kidding me?
Ants?

01:09:09.733 --> 01:09:14.196
In the ants world, the infection
is spread by spores, exploding.

01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.698
The spores live on top of the "stroma" tissue...

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:22.120
... that comes out the back of the neck,
like... a spike.

01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:26.582
But how does it spread in humans?
And how are we giving it to each other so fast?

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:29.795
We've got about 20 or 30 locals out there,
running around with this.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.631
That's nearly 20% of our
community since this morning.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.218
Bill is infected, so,
if you're right...

01:09:36.343 --> 01:09:39.179
When he dies,
he's gonna grow one of those things?

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:55.237
Joanne, Sam just killed him.

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:57.531
She's killed him,
he's dead.

01:09:58.615 --> 01:09:59.908
I'm on my way.

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:30.118
Jo',
Jo'.

01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:32.662
There's about 45 missing.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:34.540
The docs in his rooms.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:39.428
Uhm, the Pattersons are on their farm
and absolutely refusing to come in.

01:13:39.428 --> 01:13:42.670
The Jamisons, the Dysons,
the Scotts, and the Blackwoods

01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:45.133
They've made themselves safe,
but they're staying home.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:48.542
-Do they know anything more than we do?
-I don't think so.

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:50.973
Michelle and the others are still not back.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.685
-I'm gonna go after them.
-Wait, let me go.

01:13:53.771 --> 01:13:55.600
They don't need you telling them off.

01:13:55.978 --> 01:13:58.564
I'd like to go with you, please?

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:01.085
We're good here, but you don't
know what's happening out there.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:05.320
I need Luke to cover for me, he's the best
shooter we have, no offence to any of you all.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.953
You know I can't see shit in the dark, right?

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:42.751
Where are the others?

01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:45.879
We found Jensens grandmother
alone in her house.

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.342
They're all hiding in
the diner and can't get out.

01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:54.471
Lets go get them.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:07.484
Fuck!

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:08.694
Where is she going?

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:11.571
-Gonna get the others.
-Go with her.

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:13.742
-Not yet.
-Please, Luke!

01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:16.158
We can handle ourselves from in here.

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.342
You guys have never had to deal with anything more than friday night drunks and crazy farmers...

01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:21.450
Samantha, No!
Fuck!

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:25.919
I trust her.
She trusts me.

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:28.380
We really trust each other.

01:16:28.839 --> 01:16:30.215
Never heard you yell.

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.633
Yeah well...

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.553
... murder and aliens do that.

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:49.193
You wait here, in case
I need to use you as a diversion.

01:16:50.944 --> 01:16:54.198
You can't just...
shoot them if you see one.

01:16:54.820 --> 01:17:00.542
I'm not exactly running around shooting intentionally,
but I can't let them kill anyone either, you know that?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.240
It's just, my mom's one of them.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:07.836
Good?

01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:09.171
Yeah.

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.766
They followed us from the outside down.

01:17:21.225 --> 01:17:23.644
We couldn't run fast enough,
so we had to hide here.

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:27.356
Lets get out of here,
and get to the police station

01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:29.358
Just move fast and stay together.

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.401
You all have weapons?

01:17:32.528 --> 01:17:34.780
Get the children out quick first.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:37.991
I'll only slow them down,
and they can hear this wheelchair.

01:17:38.428 --> 01:17:40.110
We're not leaving her.

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:41.870
Go, go.

01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:43.747
Grandma, we're not leaving you.

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:46.291
We're gonna need a distraction.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.240
Oh shit.

01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:25.038
They're chasing him,
they're too fast.

01:18:32.253 --> 01:18:33.881
All clear, lets go.

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:38.594
Where are they?

01:18:46.977 --> 01:18:48.145
What was that?

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:52.566
You gotta keep running.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.171
Nicely done!

01:18:58.238 --> 01:18:59.781
Ellie!
No!

01:19:04.786 --> 01:19:05.579
Ellie!

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:08.957
Let her go!

01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:12.211
Be careful!

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:15.506
Joanne!

01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:36.068
Oh god,
no more...

01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:39.154
Where's Michelle?

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:49.540
We have to get the fuck out of here.

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:05.055
Run!

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.200
Go!
Get into the station!

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.457
Quick quick quick!
Run run run!

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:11.470
Quick, come on!
Go, go!

01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:14.022
Run! Keep running!
Don't stop!

01:20:21.613 --> 01:20:23.031
Oh fuck!

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:28.954
Luke!

01:20:31.248 --> 01:20:32.249
Run!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.228
Luke! Luke!
Shoot!

01:20:42.968 --> 01:20:44.219
Get in, get in!

01:21:25.594 --> 01:21:27.387
It's taking them...
Fuck!

01:21:37.397 --> 01:21:38.398
Bill.

01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:41.485
Where's it going now?

01:21:45.906 --> 01:21:47.699
Are we supposed to stop it?

01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:53.121
Oh god.

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:21.257
Let me go!

01:22:21.257 --> 01:22:22.150
-We've got to get him!
-We need a plan.
Let me go!

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:23.142
-We've got to get him!
-We need a plan.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.857
-He'll kill him!
-We need a plan.

01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:32.012
Holy fucking shit!

01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:39.686
I wanna drive out to Beacons county.

01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:44.399
It's a 2 hour drive in with nothing to protect you.
You wanna risk that like Angela?

01:23:44.525 --> 01:23:47.819
That wall is locking us in and keeping
everyone else out, you won't get through.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.971
So what?

01:23:49.028 --> 01:23:50.400
Help should have been here by now.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.514
We don't have time to sit around and wait
for their grand-master plan to kick in.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:59.257
Well I don't think they have a master-plan.
We can't pretend we know anything other than just react to what we've got.

01:23:59.342 --> 01:24:01.910
If that thing wanted us dead
it could have done it by now.

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:05.045
We have no idea if this is
happening anywhere else.

01:24:06.964 --> 01:24:08.048
What are you doing?

01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:11.093
I'm gonna drive out to the site and find Angela.

01:24:11.426 --> 01:24:15.973
She might know more by now, I don't know,
but I do know that "it" was able to understand me.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.142
So what if it did?
You wanna chat with an alien?

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.342
You said it wasn't aiming to kill us,
but our friends and family are.

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.285
That thing has something to do with it,
and I'd like to know how.

01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:27.234
We have to find Michelle first.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.457
Wait, listen.

01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:34.950
So we're not gonna chase the alien?

01:24:40.247 --> 01:24:41.623
She'll be at the corner.

01:24:41.957 --> 01:24:43.208
How do you know?

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.880
There she is.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.438
Mom?
Mom!

01:25:04.688 --> 01:25:06.398
Mom!
Please!

01:25:06.607 --> 01:25:07.566
Please let go!
Please!

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.314
No, no! Please!
Don't hurt her! Please!

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:11.150
She's not letting go!

01:25:11.914 --> 01:25:13.030
It's gonna take Michelle.

01:25:13.314 --> 01:25:14.280
It's gonna take Michelle!

01:25:15.142 --> 01:25:16.740
-Go!
-We've got to get her off her!

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.200
Can you guys do it or not?

01:25:19.203 --> 01:25:22.247
They can't do it!
Come on, let go mom!

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.600
I can't do it,
she's not letting go!

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:26.342
Please, please,
Don't kill her.

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:05.342
It's gonna attack Michelle!
Fuck!

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.620
We need to hurry.

01:26:21.515 --> 01:26:22.641
Stop!
Stop.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.685
Don't take the girl!

01:26:32.192 --> 01:26:33.986
Don't take the girl.

01:26:34.528 --> 01:26:35.571
Don't.

01:26:38.448 --> 01:26:39.449
Joanne?

01:29:14.271 --> 01:29:15.564
Where's Simon?

01:29:18.066 --> 01:29:19.610
Still sleeping.

01:29:23.989 --> 01:29:25.824
If you need to go with them,
do it.

01:29:28.869 --> 01:29:30.412
I have to stay.

01:29:43.967 --> 01:29:48.055
I have decided to take that job offer they've given us.

01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:53.852
The blood sample doc took said it's got part
human DNA, but they don't really believe it.

01:29:54.686 --> 01:29:57.606
I wanna be part of the team
that discovers who they are.

01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:00.817
They need every detail we can give them.

01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:09.076
Samantha's not leaving.

01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:13.455
I'm gonna stay.

01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:18.371
You can still have my badge,
if you stay with me.

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.370
You think they'll come back?
