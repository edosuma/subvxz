- Chapter 24...

00:03.748 --> 00:05.911
- Anybody want some coffee?
- Oh, I would love some.

00:07.753 --> 00:09.936
- After Connor's girlfriend
JoJo left the city

00:10.036 --> 00:12.219
to pursue her
reality-show dreams,

00:12.319 --> 00:14.743
Tom and Sarah were doing
everything in their power

00:14.843 --> 00:16.785
to make their baby brother
feel better.

00:16.885 --> 00:18.868
How we doing, bro?
- How you feeling, bud?

00:18.968 --> 00:20.190
- Nope.
- Nope what?

00:20.290 --> 00:22.112
- Nope to this whole line
of questioning.

00:22.212 --> 00:23.715
- Connor, we just want you
to be comfortable--

00:23.815 --> 00:26.679
- Feeling my feelings.
Yeah, I know.

00:26.779 --> 00:28.882
How's this?
It sucks that JoJo's gone.

00:28.982 --> 00:31.285
I'm sad about it.
Feelings felt.

00:31.385 --> 00:33.287
- I'm actually reading
a Faulkner biography.

00:33.387 --> 00:35.971
He had a very similar situation
to this with his wife, Estelle.

00:36.071 --> 00:37.733
- What part of "nope"
didn't you understand?

00:37.833 --> 00:40.377
- Oh, I kind of thought
that was more for Sarah.

00:40.477 --> 00:42.019
- Nope.

00:42.119 --> 00:44.182
- Hey, well,
what if we all have dinner

00:44.282 --> 00:45.944
at our place
next Saturday night, huh?

00:46.044 --> 00:47.506
Kel and Shamiah
have sleepovers,

00:47.606 --> 00:49.189
and we never all hang out
all together.

00:49.289 --> 00:50.591
- Yes, we do.

00:50.691 --> 00:52.233
That's all we do.
We're doing it right now.

00:52.333 --> 00:55.457
- Sorry, Lulu, but Marina and I
have plans Saturday night.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.360
It's Marise night.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.882
- It's a combination
of our names,

00:58.982 --> 01:01.385
Denise and Marina.
Denina.

01:02.026 --> 01:03.368
Marinise?
- We'll find it.

01:03.468 --> 01:04.890
- It's a normals' evening

01:04.990 --> 01:06.372
of my and Denise's
favorite things.

01:06.472 --> 01:08.334
- Wine, pizza,

01:08.434 --> 01:10.637
"House Hunters" marathon,
the dream.

01:10.998 --> 01:13.161
- You guys need to start
dreaming bigger.

01:13.681 --> 01:15.905
- Okay, well, uh, what
about a siblings' night?

01:16.005 --> 01:17.507
Tom, you free?

01:17.607 --> 01:19.029
- Well, you know,
Marina handles all

01:19.129 --> 01:22.594
the scheduling in our house,
so I probably can't...

01:22.694 --> 01:23.555
- He's free.
- Do it--

01:23.655 --> 01:24.436
I'm free!
Oh, awesome.

01:24.536 --> 01:26.679
- Great.
Connor?

01:26.779 --> 01:29.643
What do you say, huh?
A little post-breakup hang?

01:29.743 --> 01:31.005
- I'll think about it.

01:31.105 --> 01:33.528
- I'll take that
noncommittal answer as a yes.

01:33.628 --> 01:36.012
- It's gonna be crunk!
- Don't forget you're taking

01:36.112 --> 01:38.114
Camila to dance class
the next morning.

01:38.835 --> 01:41.940
- It's gonna be somewhat crunk!

01:42.040 --> 01:45.084
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

01:45.724 --> 01:47.187
- Oh!
[door opens, closes]

01:47.287 --> 01:49.029
♪ Ain't no party like
a "Dunston Checks In" party ♪

01:49.129 --> 01:50.872
♪ 'Cause a "Dunston Checks In"
party don't stop ♪

01:50.972 --> 01:52.434
- You still have that?

01:52.534 --> 01:53.715
- Yeah, come on,
you can't get rid of this.

01:53.815 --> 01:55.638
It's Connor's
second favorite movie

01:55.738 --> 01:57.040
where a monkey wears clothes.

01:57.140 --> 01:59.142
- Wait, didn't you get
his text? He's bailing.

01:59.743 --> 02:01.045
- What?
- Yeah.

02:01.145 --> 02:03.488
- "Just want to stay in
and lay low tonight.

02:03.588 --> 02:05.651
Have fun, fam."
Wow.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.813
- You know, he puts up a front,

02:06.913 --> 02:08.215
but I think
he's really hurting.

02:08.315 --> 02:10.317
- Won't even leave the house.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.742
What if we went to him?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.025
- Well, we do have all the
ingredients for a great party--

02:16.125 --> 02:17.507
awesome siblings...
- Check.

02:17.607 --> 02:19.029
- "Dunston Checks In"...
- Check.

02:19.129 --> 02:21.513
- Soup. I made soup.

02:21.613 --> 02:23.435
- Party patrol, let's roll.

02:23.535 --> 02:25.318
- Whoo!
Let's roll.

02:25.418 --> 02:27.280
- Whoa, how much soup
did you make?

02:27.380 --> 02:29.003
- A lot.
I made too much soup.

02:29.103 --> 02:30.405
- Have you guys
made a decision?

02:30.505 --> 02:32.848
- No, why would they go
for that ranch house,

02:32.948 --> 02:35.491
when that gorgeous mid-century
is in their price range?

02:35.591 --> 02:37.214
- Seriously, can't they see

02:37.314 --> 02:38.656
you can just convert the garage
into an ADU?

02:38.756 --> 02:40.458
Make that income.

02:40.558 --> 02:43.402
- Have fun with your limited
counter space, you ding-dongs.

02:43.762 --> 02:45.665
- Should we open
another bottle?

02:45.765 --> 02:47.808
- Why are you saying that
like it's a question?

02:48.809 --> 02:51.072
- Mommy!
I heard her again.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.955
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

02:53.055 --> 02:54.637
- What's going on?

02:54.737 --> 02:57.080
- Oh, Camila, thinks she's been
hearing a ghost in her room.

02:57.180 --> 02:58.803
Sometimes our brain
plays tricks on us

02:58.903 --> 03:00.905
when we're trying to go
to sleep, remember, sweetie?

03:01.386 --> 03:03.549
- But I actually heard her
this time.

03:03.869 --> 03:06.633
- You know, I had a ghost
in my house when I was little.

03:07.474 --> 03:09.657
- You did?
- No, she didn't.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.019
- No, I did.

03:11.119 --> 03:13.062
She would turn lights
on and off.

03:13.162 --> 03:14.464
She would move my toys.

03:14.564 --> 03:16.066
JoJo and I named her Moesha
because she was

03:16.166 --> 03:18.269
usually very active when
we were watching "Moesha."

03:18.369 --> 03:19.991
- What's "Moesha"?

03:20.091 --> 03:21.473
- Oh, we have a lot
to talk about.

03:21.573 --> 03:23.115
- Okay, it's time to go to bed,
okay, sweetie?

03:23.215 --> 03:24.677
- But I want
to hear about Moesha.

03:24.777 --> 03:25.999
- The ghost or the show?

03:26.099 --> 03:26.980
'Cause I can talk
about both for hours.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.063
- Like I said, bedtime.

03:32.227 --> 03:33.169
- [screams]
Surprise.

03:33.269 --> 03:34.651
- Surprise.
- Whoa.

03:34.751 --> 03:37.174
Ooh, yeah.
I'm definitely surprised.

03:37.274 --> 03:40.559
- You didn't want to go out,
so we decided to come to you.

03:41.079 --> 03:42.862
- Okay, move.
This soup is heavy.

03:42.962 --> 03:45.585
- Make room for fun.
- Okay.

03:45.685 --> 03:47.668
Um, hey, I-I told you guys

03:47.768 --> 03:49.230
I just wanted
to lay low tonight.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.033
I-I texted it.
It was in writing.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.234
- Well, with Gretchen
at her mom's,

03:52.334 --> 03:53.636
we thought you'd be lonely.

03:53.736 --> 03:56.640
- No, I'm fine.
Just didn't feel like hanging.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.322
- Oh, we can just do
a quiet night.

03:58.422 --> 04:00.245
Did you make cocktails?

04:00.345 --> 04:02.007
- Wait, have you been
smoking a cigar?

04:02.107 --> 04:03.489
[faint music playing]

04:03.589 --> 04:06.574
- Lupe. Yeah, she goes hard
on Saturday nights.

04:06.674 --> 04:08.136
- Where's that music
coming from?

04:08.236 --> 04:10.238
- Nothing, nowhere, nobody.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.865
[distant laughter]
- [laughing]

04:14.965 --> 04:17.989
Well, I mean, it's been nice
of you guys to cruise on by

04:18.089 --> 04:21.033
but, uh...
[yawns] Oh. Oh, man.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.036
- Okay, well,
we'll just take off.

04:23.136 --> 04:25.138
- We'll just leave.
- Okay.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.164
- Oh.
- Oh, hey!

04:29.264 --> 04:31.827
[laughter]

04:33.990 --> 04:35.993
- Sarah.
- Spags?

04:37.275 --> 04:40.078
- Is that split pea soup?
- Smoked lentil.

04:42.442 --> 04:44.384
- Hey, how's Camila doing?
- Honestly, not great.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.187
Why did you tell her
that ghost story?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.949
- Because it happened,
we had a ghost--

04:48.049 --> 04:49.471
Moesha Lansbury.

04:49.571 --> 04:50.993
The ghost also liked
"Murder, She Wrote."

04:51.093 --> 04:52.715
- Great, well, now Camila

04:52.815 --> 04:55.980
is even more scared
of something that isn't real.

04:56.781 --> 04:59.605
- I'm sorry, but how do
you know it's not real?

04:59.705 --> 05:02.408
- Oh, I don't know,
'cause of physics

05:02.508 --> 05:05.392
and biology and common sense.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.415
- Okay.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.977
I didn't want to say anything
because I know you

05:09.077 --> 05:11.501
don't believe in this stuff,
but I have been sensing

05:11.601 --> 05:14.024
a negative energy
in this space for a while.

05:14.124 --> 05:15.947
- Yeah, it's called Tom.

05:16.047 --> 05:18.069
- Who owned the house
before you bought it?

05:18.169 --> 05:20.513
- I don't know. I forget.
Uh, Janet something.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.956
It was a trust sale.
- A trust sale.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.318
Okay, that explains it.

05:24.418 --> 05:25.960
[whispering] Janet must've died
in this house.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.482
- [whispering]
She did die in this house,

05:27.582 --> 05:29.485
and that's why we bought it
for such a good price.

05:29.585 --> 05:31.287
[normal voice] Whoop, whoop!
- [normal voice] Marina.

05:31.387 --> 05:33.210
The restless spirit of Janet
is trapped in this house,

05:33.310 --> 05:35.513
and it is haunting your family.
-[gasps]

05:36.554 --> 05:38.597
[gasps, screams]

05:40.119 --> 05:41.661
- You lied to us so that
you could hang out

05:41.761 --> 05:43.423
with a bunch of rich guys.

05:43.523 --> 05:46.748
- Is that Mark Cuban in there?
- Yes, he's friends with Spags.

05:46.848 --> 05:48.550
- What?
- How is that possible?

05:48.650 --> 05:52.436
- I lied because I just want
to have a fun, dumb night

05:52.536 --> 05:54.238
with my fun, dumb friends

05:54.338 --> 05:55.920
where we don't have to talk
about my feelings.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.283
- I can be fun and dumb.
- No, you cannot, Sarah.

05:58.383 --> 05:59.605
All you try to do
is get me to talk

05:59.705 --> 06:01.047
and, Tom, all you do is talk.

06:01.147 --> 06:03.430
- What? I hate the sound
of my own voice.

06:03.871 --> 06:05.052
- Do you?
[cell phone chimes]

06:05.152 --> 06:06.775
- Tom sat pensively
on a park bench

06:06.875 --> 06:08.097
watching a red balloon
float by.

06:08.197 --> 06:10.860
Okay, that's for work.
- Sarah!

06:10.960 --> 06:12.382
I've been looking
all over for you.

06:12.482 --> 06:14.145
- I saw you, like,
one minute ago, Spags.

06:14.245 --> 06:15.867
- All right, bring it in.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.269
- No.
- All right.

06:17.369 --> 06:19.392
- Spags, haven't seen you
since the wedding.

06:19.492 --> 06:20.834
How's married life?

06:20.934 --> 06:24.278
- Oh, well, I wouldn't know,
as I am divorced.

06:24.378 --> 06:27.803
- Oh. [chuckles] Sorry.
That seems...quick.

06:27.903 --> 06:30.386
- Nah, it was, like, the
longest 11 months of my life,

06:31.027 --> 06:33.451
but, you know,
you can't tame this stallion.

06:33.551 --> 06:34.572
All right,
so what are we doing?

06:34.672 --> 06:36.294
Uh, we playing poker or what?

06:36.394 --> 06:39.218
- Oh, well, we would love to,
but we weren't exactly invited.

06:39.318 --> 06:41.181
- Specifically not invited.

06:41.281 --> 06:44.485
- Okay, well, I'm inviting you.

06:45.366 --> 06:46.708
I invited Mark Cuban.

06:46.808 --> 06:48.631
- Yeah, uh, quick question--

06:48.731 --> 06:49.873
how the hell did that happen?

06:49.973 --> 06:51.194
- Let's just say
when you're the inventor

06:51.294 --> 06:54.298
of Drawer D'Oeuvres,
it opens a lot of...

06:56.662 --> 06:58.684
Drawer doors.
- Yikes.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.447
- Well, they were
just leaving, so...

07:00.547 --> 07:03.331
- Oh, can Sarah stay?
Like, I'll pay for your buy-in.

07:03.431 --> 07:04.492
- Oh, that's so generous,

07:04.592 --> 07:05.894
but I can pay
for my own buy-in.

07:05.994 --> 07:07.016
- It's $800.

07:07.116 --> 07:08.698
- That would be great.
Thank you.

07:08.798 --> 07:12.503
- Let's play some poker!
- Let's play some...

07:12.603 --> 07:14.606
both: Poker!

07:15.527 --> 07:18.030
- Okay, you can stay...
- [laughs]

07:18.130 --> 07:20.674
- As long as you act
a little less you.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.996
- All right.
- Okay?

07:22.096 --> 07:23.358
That means do not ask me
about my breakup.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.001
Do not ask me about JoJo.
- Who's JoJo?

07:26.101 --> 07:27.283
- No correcting grammar.

07:27.383 --> 07:29.726
No lectures
on late-stage capitalism.

07:29.826 --> 07:32.089
No pushing your soup.
Just be bros.

07:32.189 --> 07:33.411
- I can be bro,

07:33.511 --> 07:35.013
although I don't like
that gendered term.

07:35.113 --> 07:36.575
- Sarah.

07:36.675 --> 07:38.618
- Let's drink some brewskis
and objectify women, dude.

07:38.718 --> 07:40.180
What?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.944
- Don't worry about me.
I can hang with the big boys.

07:43.044 --> 07:44.145
- Don't call them big boys.

07:44.245 --> 07:46.248
You guys are
already tanking this.

07:47.650 --> 07:49.953
- Aunt Denise,
is that house haunted?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.997
- Oh, no, sweetie.
That's a new construction.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.760
Those are rarely haunted...

07:54.860 --> 07:56.862
unless it's on
an ancient burial ground.

07:57.263 --> 07:59.446
- Denise, could you come
with me to the kitchen?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.689
We'll be right back, okay?

08:01.789 --> 08:03.912
- Wait, can you turn on
another light?

08:04.753 --> 08:06.756
- These are all
of the lights, honey.

17:20.579 --> 17:24.123
or haunted houses
or tarot crystals.

17:24.223 --> 17:27.168
- [laughs]
Tarot crystals do not exist.

17:27.268 --> 17:28.569
Oh, but should they?

17:28.669 --> 17:30.572
- I do like having
a best friend

17:30.672 --> 17:32.855
that sees the world
differently than I do.

17:32.955 --> 17:34.457
- And I like having
a best friend

17:34.557 --> 17:35.899
who questions everything.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.862
It's a nice challenge for me.

17:37.962 --> 17:40.666
But you have to admit--
you were spooked by Janet.

17:40.766 --> 17:44.471
- No, I was concerned
about an unexplained noise

17:44.571 --> 17:46.514
that was later explained.

17:46.614 --> 17:48.917
- No, you were scared
of a ghost.

17:49.017 --> 17:51.200
- I have never been
and will never be

17:51.300 --> 17:53.302
scared of a ghost.

17:55.105 --> 17:57.108
Denise, I know that was you.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.511
- That wasn't me.

18:00.993 --> 18:02.735
[gasps]

18:02.835 --> 18:05.839
- By the way, the rats may
have chewed through your wires.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.284
- You mean the bats?
- No, you also have rats.

18:10.365 --> 18:12.368
Bye.

18:14.411 --> 18:16.514
- Oh. [laughs]
- [growls]

18:16.614 --> 18:18.777
- Remember,
story comes from character,

18:19.377 --> 18:20.479
not the other way around.

18:20.579 --> 18:22.682
- I'll remember.
- All right.

18:22.782 --> 18:24.565
- Thanks for the soup.

18:24.665 --> 18:27.148
Later, Connor.
- Later, Mark Cuban.

18:29.471 --> 18:32.155
- Good guy.
He's a good guy.

18:32.555 --> 18:34.378
- Wait, so why did you bail
on the game?

18:34.478 --> 18:36.060
- Yeah, we were bro-ing out
with your bros

18:36.160 --> 18:38.103
just like you wanted--
we didn't talk about JoJo.

18:38.203 --> 18:39.585
We didn't talk
about your feelings once.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.746
- Yeah, because you talked

18:40.846 --> 18:42.949
about everybody else's
feelings.

18:43.049 --> 18:45.032
Now Terrence is dealing
with abandonment issues,

18:45.132 --> 18:48.296
and you made Mark Cuban
contemplate a career change.

18:48.617 --> 18:49.999
Mark Cuban!

18:50.099 --> 18:51.481
That's irresponsible, Tom.

18:51.581 --> 18:53.523
- Look, it's not my fault
that he's

18:53.623 --> 18:55.967
so deeply interested
in my process.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.729
- Everyone talking
about their feelings

18:57.829 --> 18:59.872
made me think
about my feelings.

19:00.232 --> 19:02.876
I just wanted one night
of distraction,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.279
and you guys took that from me.

19:08.363 --> 19:10.706
- I'm sorry, Con.
We--we blew it.

19:10.806 --> 19:12.589
We knew you wanted
a dumb night.

19:12.689 --> 19:14.271
- That's why we brought
a stupid movie like

19:14.371 --> 19:17.435
"Dunston Checks In," but we'll
give you your space, okay?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.719
We're sorry.

19:19.819 --> 19:22.462
- Wait, you brought
"Dunston Checks In"?

19:24.425 --> 19:26.708
It's my second favorite movie
where a monkey wears clothes.

19:27.429 --> 19:28.651
- We know.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.693
- There's that part
where Dunston swings

19:30.793 --> 19:33.978
from the chandelier and knocks
that lady into the cake.

19:34.078 --> 19:36.080
- Yeah.

19:36.721 --> 19:38.103
Dunston does that.

19:38.203 --> 19:40.546
[soft music]

19:40.646 --> 19:42.769
- I mean, I guess
it's still kind of early.

19:44.331 --> 19:46.434
[laughing]

19:46.534 --> 19:48.537
Dunston.

19:48.978 --> 19:52.402
[sighs] This is seriously dumb.
Thank you.

19:52.502 --> 19:54.085
- It's our pleasure.

19:54.185 --> 19:56.047
Remind me--what is
your favorite movie

19:56.147 --> 19:57.449
with a monkey
that wears clothes?

19:57.549 --> 19:59.532
- Some things are meant
to remain private, Tom.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.014
- Look at us--

20:01.114 --> 20:03.617
watching late-night movies,
just like old times.

20:03.717 --> 20:05.920
- Still gay, still married.

20:06.281 --> 20:08.284
- Right on.

20:08.644 --> 20:10.647
- [laughs, screeches]

20:11.608 --> 20:14.672
- It's game time.
Okay, next hand--

20:14.772 --> 20:16.995
Chicago high
with a Black Mariah.

20:17.095 --> 20:18.557
Let's double the ante, huh?

20:18.657 --> 20:20.280
- So 50 cents it is.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.564
- Mm, by the way, Lulu,
I won $1,500 last night.

20:23.664 --> 20:25.967
- Ooh, your horoscope
was right.

20:26.067 --> 20:28.150
- Nope, nothing to do
with that.

20:28.471 --> 20:29.853
By the way, the kids
are really quiet.

20:29.953 --> 20:31.094
Should we check on them?

20:31.194 --> 20:33.057
- Nah, Lupe's got them
under control.

20:33.157 --> 20:35.760
- Okay, I've got two queens.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.184
- Full house.
I win again.

20:38.284 --> 20:40.267
- You're bleeding us dry, Lupe.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.069
- You got to know
when to hold them,

20:42.169 --> 20:44.152
know when to fold them,

20:44.252 --> 20:45.353
and know when
to brush your teeth.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.157
Come on, it's bedtime.
[all groan]

20:48.257 --> 20:51.061
[jazzy flourish]
