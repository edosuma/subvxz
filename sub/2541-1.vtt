01:32.058 --> 01:33.241
<i>Jesus, that <b>is</b> loud.</i>

01:33.243 --> 01:35.193
I'd call
and complain, too.

01:36.579 --> 01:38.629
Neighbors also said
there was screaming.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.061
It's the police!

02:11.097 --> 02:12.347
Hey, shouldn't we
wait for backup?

02:12.349 --> 02:13.331
<i>You wait.</i>

02:22.209 --> 02:24.008
Are you
checkin' this out?

02:52.989 --> 02:54.022
Now!

02:54.024 --> 02:55.306
Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

02:55.308 --> 02:57.575
Police!
Freeze!

02:58.378 --> 02:59.744
Ma'am?

02:59.746 --> 03:01.312
You all right?

03:05.252 --> 03:08.003
Is she alone in here?

03:08.005 --> 03:09.070
Ma'am?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.443
Oh, my God.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.729
What the f--

03:17.731 --> 03:19.014
Blaine!

03:21.151 --> 03:23.567
No! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

03:25.989 --> 03:27.121
Aaahhh!

03:51.030 --> 03:52.296
Officer...

03:54.300 --> 03:55.533
Officer down.

04:18.557 --> 04:19.723
Move it back, people!

04:19.725 --> 04:22.593
Please. Step back.
Move back.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.762
Ready to go live
in three...

04:24.764 --> 04:25.763
two...

04:25.765 --> 04:26.764
And one.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.500
It's--it's
indescribable.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.701
This-- This horrific
crime scene

04:30.703 --> 04:32.537
<i>where a rookie officer
has been savagely</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:34.672
<i>hacked to death at this
dilapidated residence.</i>

04:34.674 --> 04:36.340
...in what
authorities have described

04:36.342 --> 04:38.142
as a gruesome crime scene,

04:38.144 --> 04:40.211
two officers entered
this abandoned building

04:40.213 --> 04:41.412
earlier this afternoon.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.848
What they found inside
is simply too grisly...

04:43.850 --> 04:45.683
<i>The young officer
who lost his life</i>

04:45.685 --> 04:47.584
<i>in this attack
has not been identified</i>

04:47.586 --> 04:49.320
<i>pending notification
of next of kin.</i>

04:49.322 --> 04:50.688
Williams risked his own life

04:50.690 --> 04:52.690
to rescue the young woman
being held hostage

04:52.692 --> 04:54.525
on the premises.
So far, the remains...

04:54.527 --> 04:56.694
<i>So far, seven human
remains have been unearthed,</i>

04:56.696 --> 04:58.863
<i>all with the eyes
grotesquely removed</i>

04:58.865 --> 05:01.232
<i>in what police are saying is
one of the most diabolical...</i>

05:01.234 --> 05:03.301
The only possible clue
to the horrendous acts

05:03.303 --> 05:05.269
which occurred here today
lay in the hands

05:05.271 --> 05:07.071
of two very shaken
survivors.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.939
14-year police veteran
Frank Williams

05:08.941 --> 05:10.925
is the only
surviving officer.

05:10.927 --> 05:13.294
He's being taken from the scene
with severe injuries,

05:13.296 --> 05:14.462
and at this point,

05:14.464 --> 05:15.964
his condition
is listed as critical.

05:15.966 --> 05:18.316
<i>...for any clues
they can provide.</i>

05:21.637 --> 05:23.454
<i>...female victim,</i>

05:23.456 --> 05:25.122
<i>who was brutally
blinded.</i>

05:25.124 --> 05:26.724
<i>...will be consulted</i>

05:26.726 --> 05:28.242
<i>as numerous unsolved mysteries
may be laid to rest</i>

05:28.244 --> 05:29.477
<i>with these tragic...</i>

05:29.479 --> 05:31.529
<i>Investigators
are anxious to question</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:33.480
<i>Sergeant Williams
and the female...</i>

05:33.482 --> 05:34.982
For now,
both will be rushed

05:34.984 --> 05:36.750
to Overland General
for psychiatric evaluation

05:36.752 --> 05:38.302
and trauma care.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.904
Stay tuned to
this developing story as--

06:39.113 --> 06:40.047
Hey, Russell.

06:40.049 --> 06:40.815
What, dude?

06:43.268 --> 06:44.969
Check this out, bro.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.339
I don't need to.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.540
Help a white boy out.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.642
Sweet.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.076
Keep it down back there.

06:53.228 --> 06:55.713
Gentlemen,
can we move it?

06:55.715 --> 06:57.715
How many more miles?

06:57.717 --> 06:58.916
Richie, please.

07:00.051 --> 07:01.519
Shut up, man.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.960
I found these condoms.

07:10.462 --> 07:12.880
Why are you
looking at me?God.

07:12.882 --> 07:14.115
Busted.

07:15.718 --> 07:18.720
We need to be able
to trust you guys.

07:18.722 --> 07:21.306
This is the first coed
program of its kind.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.558
So, again...

07:23.560 --> 07:24.759
no fraternizing.

07:26.896 --> 07:27.979
Melissa?

07:29.064 --> 07:29.963
Melissa!

07:33.602 --> 07:34.736
Ma'am?

07:34.738 --> 07:36.170
She's the last person

07:36.172 --> 07:37.822
you've got to worry about.

07:38.673 --> 07:39.857
You bitch.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.160
Oh, my God.
The mute spoke.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.777
Watch your ass, slut.

07:44.763 --> 07:47.081
What, like the way
you watch Kira's?

07:47.083 --> 07:48.882
Dyke.

07:48.884 --> 07:49.701
Ladies.

07:54.707 --> 07:55.873
They're here.

08:00.596 --> 08:02.096
Bunch of losers.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.914
Hope they had
their shots.

08:07.202 --> 08:09.136
Zo, pass me
my bag, please.

08:10.639 --> 08:11.488
Sure.

08:16.428 --> 08:17.562
Thanks.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.034
Dude, you better
back up off me.

08:25.304 --> 08:26.787
I just about had
enough of your shit.

08:26.789 --> 08:28.005
Oh, my God.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.707
Move me, boy.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.075
What?
Son of a bitch.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.960
I got your boy.
I'm'a show--

08:32.962 --> 08:33.995
Let's go, shithead.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.163
Hey!
"Boy," huh?

08:35.164 --> 08:37.048
You two knock it off.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.565
I said
knock it off!

08:38.567 --> 08:39.751
Fuckface.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.419
You'd rather
stay here?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.538
Go back inside?

08:43.539 --> 08:44.505
Now, get goin'.

08:48.627 --> 08:49.827
Hey, Frank.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.146
<i>I thought my group
was animals.</i>

08:52.148 --> 08:54.164
Those two
gonna make it?

08:54.166 --> 08:55.666
We'll see.

08:56.684 --> 08:57.684
Hello, ladies.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.186
Don't
sit next to me.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.687
<i>What are you
lookin' at?</i>

09:13.620 --> 09:16.186
Hello, everyone.
I'm Hannah Anders.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.456
This is Frank Williams.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.240
You guys know that
your hard work this weekend

09:20.242 --> 09:22.209
will pay off
in shorter sentences.

09:22.211 --> 09:25.479
I hope you can prove to us
that we made the right decision

09:25.481 --> 09:26.798
in choosing you
for this program.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.566
What's up,
squeaky tweaker?

09:29.568 --> 09:31.068
Fuck you, Mike.

09:33.789 --> 09:35.857
Been there.
Done that.

09:35.859 --> 09:38.225
I used
to hit that shit.

09:38.227 --> 09:40.061
Is that what
you call it?

09:40.063 --> 09:41.028
What, I say somethin'?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.865
Dumb-ass.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.233
You talkin' to me, Rufus?

09:45.235 --> 09:46.617
Yeah.
You know what?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.319
You might
want to move.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.624
Hey!

09:53.626 --> 09:55.543
Oh my God.
Hey!

09:55.545 --> 09:57.378
Break it up
back there!

09:57.380 --> 09:58.996
I said break it up.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.599
What? I didn't do shit.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.168
I don't care.
Act up again,

10:04.170 --> 10:06.236
we turn around.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.205
That goes
for all of you.

10:11.427 --> 10:13.761
God, his hand.
What happened to him?

10:13.763 --> 10:15.513
You mean the claw?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.514
Leprosy.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.815
I heard
Chihuahua attack.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.609
Hey, you're, like, the dog
pound liberator, huh?

10:28.611 --> 10:30.578
Dog pound liberator?

10:30.580 --> 10:33.130
Yeah. They were
gonna gas 'em.

10:34.115 --> 10:35.265
Nice move, though.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.103
I respect that.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.543
I'm gonna need drugs.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.596
I heard that.

10:48.598 --> 10:49.881
Where the fuck
are they taking us?

10:56.388 --> 10:58.389
Yo, Tye.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.960
Tye.
Come on, man.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.462
Can't a brother
get some rest?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.230
Look, I might had
a proposition for you.

11:07.632 --> 11:08.966
For me.

11:08.968 --> 11:09.900
Yeah.

11:12.804 --> 11:14.472
I'm listenin'.

11:22.898 --> 11:24.999
Okay,
everyone, this is it.

11:27.819 --> 11:29.420
Damn.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.088
<i>What is this?
Hotel Ghetto?</i>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.224
<i>Like you'd know.</i>

11:33.226 --> 11:35.760
<i>I thought
my 'hood was bad.</i>

11:40.098 --> 11:41.799
Mr. Williams.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.268
I'm so glad
this worked out.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.185
Me, too, Margaret.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.904
Thanks for
the opportunity.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.022
How's our
first group?

11:49.024 --> 11:50.191
Not so good.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.459
Some a little
worse than others.

11:54.862 --> 11:56.863
<i>We left County
for this?</i>

11:56.865 --> 11:57.798
'Scuse me.

11:58.866 --> 12:00.568
Let's go.

12:02.203 --> 12:03.904
Slave labor
bullshit.

12:12.381 --> 12:14.482
Oh my God.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.234
What a dump.

12:18.336 --> 12:19.637
Damn!

12:19.639 --> 12:22.473
Uhh. Smelled
better on the bus.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.941
I wonder
if there's cable.

12:23.943 --> 12:24.859
Knock it off.

12:24.861 --> 12:27.178
Good afternoon, everyone.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.480
I'm Margaret Gaine.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.065
I'm involved
in the renovation

12:31.067 --> 12:33.467
of historical landmarks.
This property

12:33.469 --> 12:36.070
was donated to us
a few years ago.

12:36.072 --> 12:39.240
We toyed with the idea
of reopening the hotel,

12:39.242 --> 12:41.508
but honestly, what
this part of town

12:41.510 --> 12:44.495
really needs is a shelter
for the homeless.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.114
That's where
you guys come in.

12:47.116 --> 12:48.332
What, homeless?

12:48.334 --> 12:49.750
No, dear.

12:49.752 --> 12:50.868
Volunteers.

12:50.870 --> 12:51.869
We didn't
volunteer.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.004
Dude.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.755
Can't you ever
fuckin' shut up?

12:54.757 --> 12:55.539
Eat me.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.558
Oh, yeah.
Good comeback.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.809
Fuck you.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.661
Uh, what museum...

13:00.663 --> 13:02.647
did you say you
work for, granny?

13:02.649 --> 13:04.915
Guys. You know
the tradeoff

13:04.917 --> 13:07.318
for three days' work is
a month off your sentence.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.368
That's not
a bad deal.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.276
Let me tell
you somethin'.

13:15.278 --> 13:17.144
Hannah and I are
here on a weekend

13:17.146 --> 13:19.680
because we believe
in second chances.

13:19.682 --> 13:21.081
Don't prove us
wrong.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.117
For the next three days,
if Margaret asks you

13:23.119 --> 13:25.135
to do somethin',
you better do it.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.153
You got it?

13:28.290 --> 13:30.157
Who wants a tour?

13:32.744 --> 13:35.345
Mr. Blackwell built the hotel
I can't believe this.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.714
as a playground for
himself and his friends.

13:37.716 --> 13:40.351
Rumor has it that there
are hidden passageways

13:40.353 --> 13:41.502
and two-way mirrors
all over,

13:41.504 --> 13:43.437
although
I've never found them.

13:43.439 --> 13:45.539
We've almost finished
renovating the suites

13:45.541 --> 13:46.607
on the second floor.

13:46.609 --> 13:48.526
That's where
you'll all be staying.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.410
Penthouse floors, however,
on eight and nine

13:50.412 --> 13:52.980
are off-limits. It's too
dangerous for guests.

13:52.982 --> 13:53.981
Why? What happened?

13:53.983 --> 13:55.315
There was a fire
in '71.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.316
It gutted them.

13:56.318 --> 13:57.918
It killed Mr. Blackwell,
his wife,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.453
and a few others.

13:59.455 --> 14:02.389
And since the hotel was

14:02.391 --> 14:04.041
more of a hobby
than a business,

14:04.043 --> 14:06.660
it's never been repaired.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.528
Besides, we don't
want your parents

14:08.530 --> 14:10.597
suing us if you
get hurt, now, do we?

14:11.818 --> 14:14.668
Oh. Before I forget.
During mealtimes,

14:14.670 --> 14:16.987
you all can eat
in the atrium.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.623
However, the doors must
remain locked at night.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.559
So. Ladies...

14:22.561 --> 14:23.761
grab a trash bag.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.979
Gentlemen, brooms.

14:25.981 --> 14:27.548
Michael, is it?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.800
Yeah. You want me
to be shot caller?

14:29.802 --> 14:32.536
No. No, we want
you to mop.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.071
The lavatory's
over there.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.041
Your heard her, Mike.
Get the mop.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.980
Hey, I'm tryin'
to clean here!

15:22.220 --> 15:23.253
Cut it out!

15:46.929 --> 15:47.928
Oh, sh--

15:49.749 --> 15:51.348
Hello?

16:02.927 --> 16:03.861
Hello?

16:05.931 --> 16:07.164
Ohh!

16:07.166 --> 16:08.833
Shh!
You scared me!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.751
Keep your voice down.

16:13.771 --> 16:15.772
Did you open that?

16:15.774 --> 16:18.225
Yeah. I'm gettin'
the fuck outta here.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.002
What?

16:29.621 --> 16:32.288
This only leads out
to the atrium.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.742
You'd still be
inside the hotel.

16:38.714 --> 16:40.064
Jesus!

16:41.733 --> 16:43.584
Nice try, though.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.152
Hmmhh.

16:45.154 --> 16:47.488
Come on, don't let
Michael get to your head.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.323
You don't understand.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.459
Where'd you get those?

16:52.461 --> 16:55.462
What's-her-name. She
lifted 'em off Hannah.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.597
Oh. Zoe.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.334
Yeah. Zoe.

17:02.670 --> 17:04.371
I just can't believe
the same asshole

17:04.373 --> 17:05.605
that got me locked up

17:05.607 --> 17:07.141
is gonna be sleepin'
down the hall.

17:07.143 --> 17:08.843
You know?

17:08.845 --> 17:09.776
I know.

17:14.449 --> 17:16.616
Can I have one?

17:18.320 --> 17:19.252
Shit.

17:21.690 --> 17:22.622
We were just...

17:41.359 --> 17:42.692
Thanks, girls.

17:46.214 --> 17:48.148
Try not to burn
the place down.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.950
Yes, sir.

17:52.221 --> 17:53.320
Okay.

17:59.394 --> 18:01.728
You think he whacks off
with that thing?

18:01.730 --> 18:02.796
Definitely.

18:14.242 --> 18:15.242
Tye.

18:15.244 --> 18:16.910
What's up?

18:16.912 --> 18:18.545
All that, uh,
all that stuff

18:18.547 --> 18:19.546
about the hidden rooms,

18:19.548 --> 18:21.915
the passages,
the stairwells?

18:21.917 --> 18:23.683
All true.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.986
This is what I was
talkin' about on the bus.

18:32.593 --> 18:33.927
So what?

18:33.929 --> 18:36.663
Okay. This is
where you come in.

18:36.665 --> 18:37.998
Can you crack a safe?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.499
Please. Open 'em
like I open

18:39.501 --> 18:41.201
your mama's legs.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.270
<i>Good, 'cause
there is a safe.</i>

18:43.272 --> 18:44.437
Here.

18:44.439 --> 18:46.039
Blackwell's
private stash.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.440
Never been recovered.

18:47.442 --> 18:48.441
Why not?

18:48.443 --> 18:50.343
No one
knows about it.

18:50.345 --> 18:52.980
I mean, this place is
a goddamn maze, but...

18:52.982 --> 18:54.214
I got the blueprints.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.349
Look, man, I'm not tryin'
to get no more time.

18:56.351 --> 18:57.550
You won't.
You won't. Look,

18:57.552 --> 18:59.452
if we get caught wandering,
you know, we just say...

18:59.454 --> 19:01.288
we got lost.

19:01.290 --> 19:02.956
It's simple.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.291
And this shit
is current.

19:04.293 --> 19:06.626
'Course it is. I mean,
why wouldn't it be?

19:06.628 --> 19:08.628
You tellin' me
after 35 years

19:08.630 --> 19:10.964
no one's found
this so-called safe?

19:10.966 --> 19:13.383
Have you got anything else
better to do?

19:16.287 --> 19:18.021
All right, Richie-Rich.
I'm down.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.000
What?

19:47.002 --> 19:48.001
I'm working.

19:48.003 --> 19:49.435
I didn't say anything.

19:51.589 --> 19:54.941
I'm glad you were cleared
for this project, Christine.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.410
Out of everyone here,
I think

19:56.412 --> 19:58.512
you've got
the most potential.

19:58.514 --> 19:59.830
Do you, now?

19:59.832 --> 20:02.098
I've seen
everyone's file.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.967
I know your story.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.437
Why you attacked
your stepfather...

20:06.439 --> 20:07.905
what happened
to your sister.

20:09.173 --> 20:10.774
You got
a shitty deal.

20:15.346 --> 20:16.447
Yeah.

20:17.515 --> 20:20.851
Actually, speaking
of shitty deals...

20:20.853 --> 20:23.036
whose bright idea was it
to put Kira and Michael

20:23.038 --> 20:24.687
on this project
together?

20:24.689 --> 20:25.822
What are you
talkin' about?

20:26.908 --> 20:28.141
What I'm talking about

20:28.143 --> 20:30.210
is Kira used
to work for that prick

20:30.212 --> 20:32.195
out on the streets.
What?

20:32.197 --> 20:35.048
Yeah...when he wasn't
beating her ass.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.535
She rolled over on him,
and now because of you guys,

20:39.537 --> 20:41.772
he's here, and he's
been fuckin' stalking her

20:41.774 --> 20:43.039
the whole time.
Okay.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.142
Okay. We didn't know.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.211
I'll deal with it.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.816
Yeah. You
deal with it.

20:58.641 --> 20:59.906
You'd get with her?

20:59.908 --> 21:01.208
Absolutely.

21:03.245 --> 21:04.644
What, you wouldn't?

21:04.646 --> 21:06.663
Man, your standards
are too high.

21:08.399 --> 21:10.400
What's up, bitch?

21:10.402 --> 21:12.202
I mean, uh...
Rich.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.336
Come on.
You didn't stick

21:13.338 --> 21:14.654
your tongue in this,
did you?

21:14.656 --> 21:16.189
Yes, as
a matter of fact.

21:20.077 --> 21:22.146
I specifically asked
for no meat.

21:24.315 --> 21:27.017
The granola girl's
on a rampage.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.686
Shoulda left her tofu-munching
ass back in County.

21:31.255 --> 21:34.257
Hey, uh, you want
my potato salad?

21:34.259 --> 21:35.725
Oh, that's sweet.
Thanks.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.061
"That's
sweet. Thanks."

21:41.566 --> 21:42.932
Ass.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.336
Oh, the poor thing.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.422
Here. Come here, puppy.
Want some food?

21:52.609 --> 21:54.728
Here you go. Ahh!

21:54.730 --> 21:56.630
Fucking moron!

21:56.632 --> 21:57.798
What?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.933
He's starving!
What?

22:00.935 --> 22:02.653
It's a fucking stray dog.
Who gives as shit?

22:12.479 --> 22:13.546
She wasn't
that fat.

22:13.548 --> 22:14.915
You got that shit?

22:18.252 --> 22:21.521
Hey. How about
a peace offering?

22:21.523 --> 22:23.023
You can pimp it up
in the penthouse.

22:24.391 --> 22:26.476
Home-grown aspirin?

22:26.478 --> 22:28.178
Hell, yeah.

22:30.165 --> 22:32.266
How about it,
granola girl?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.516
It's organic.

22:35.052 --> 22:36.269
Bring it on.

22:47.448 --> 22:48.614
Hey.

22:48.616 --> 22:50.450
Do you think,
uh...

22:50.452 --> 22:53.637
veggie girl...
you know...

22:53.639 --> 22:55.572
likes tube steak?

22:55.574 --> 22:56.640
Dude.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.424
You'll never know,
will you?

22:58.426 --> 23:00.793
But I'll let you smell
my fingers later.

23:03.347 --> 23:05.498
You two
aren't partying?

23:06.784 --> 23:08.418
Mmm.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.769
Pussies.

23:17.127 --> 23:19.229
Rich pussies.

23:23.551 --> 23:25.034
This better work,
Richie-Rich.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.827
Michael?

24:23.829 --> 24:25.662
You asshole.

24:25.664 --> 24:26.696
Uhh!

24:37.175 --> 24:39.125
How the fuck did
you get in here?

24:39.127 --> 24:41.244
You should be
used to me comi''

24:41.246 --> 24:42.796
through the back door.

24:42.798 --> 24:44.831
Get out! Get
the fuck outta here!

24:44.833 --> 24:46.032
Jesus Christ, bitch--

24:46.034 --> 24:47.517
No! Get out now!

24:48.603 --> 24:51.270
Hey! Let her go!

24:51.272 --> 24:52.823
And what if I don't?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.290
I said...

24:54.292 --> 24:56.760
fucking
let her go. Now.

25:03.735 --> 25:06.019
You bitches.

25:08.322 --> 25:10.657
Fucking asshole.

25:10.659 --> 25:11.591
You okay?

25:13.060 --> 25:14.661
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.433
I'm sorry.

25:33.681 --> 25:34.614
This one.

25:38.019 --> 25:39.285
Damn.
It's locked.

25:47.411 --> 25:48.895
Nice.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.508
Wow. All this

26:01.510 --> 26:02.659
for Russell?

26:04.027 --> 26:06.630
He's interested
in my views.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.831
<i>Is that why he keeps
lookin' at your ass?</i>

26:10.268 --> 26:13.002
My girl even shaved
her furry legs

26:13.004 --> 26:14.721
for this guy.

26:14.723 --> 26:16.856
Yeah, well, I was
getting a little sick

26:16.858 --> 26:18.458
of the natural look
anyway.

26:18.460 --> 26:21.194
If lookin' like a Hobbit
is natural.

26:24.732 --> 26:25.982
So, you guys coming?

26:30.071 --> 26:32.238
Mm. Come on.
Let's go.

26:43.251 --> 26:44.534
Thanks.

26:45.887 --> 26:46.837
Nice rock.

26:48.105 --> 26:49.172
Thank you.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.175
Why is it
on your right hand?

26:53.744 --> 26:56.746
I'm, uh...
test-driving it.

26:58.649 --> 27:00.683
I haven't given him
an answer yet.

27:02.019 --> 27:04.420
Why?

27:04.422 --> 27:05.588
He's decent,
right?

27:07.325 --> 27:08.325
Yeah.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.227
Got all his own teeth?

27:10.229 --> 27:11.995
Yeah.

27:13.764 --> 27:15.431
What are you
waiting for?

27:20.938 --> 27:22.905
Man! You...you smell that?

27:22.907 --> 27:25.442
Bet no one's been
up here since the fire.

27:25.444 --> 27:28.295
I think
you're wrong, dawg.

27:28.297 --> 27:30.714
Yeah. Yeah,
maybe I'm wrong.

27:37.788 --> 27:39.455
Why would they leave
all this here?

27:39.457 --> 27:40.890
Maybe they found
the safe,

27:40.892 --> 27:43.059
got rich, and didn't
need this shit no more.

27:48.065 --> 27:49.699
Check him out.

27:50.767 --> 27:52.552
Yeah.

27:52.554 --> 27:54.320
He's dead.

27:54.322 --> 27:55.388
No shit.

27:55.390 --> 27:56.956
Probably
from the fire.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.741
The fire was
30 years ago.

27:58.743 --> 28:01.294
This guy's fresh. He wasn't
killed in the fuckin' fire.

28:01.296 --> 28:02.879
Stop freakin' out
on me. All right?

28:04.048 --> 28:06.482
Maybe he's got
some money on him.

28:06.484 --> 28:07.784
You never know.

28:12.974 --> 28:15.374
Uhh! Where the fuck
are his eyes?

28:18.579 --> 28:22.299
Richie! Where
you goin'? Richie!

28:24.318 --> 28:25.318
Richie!

28:34.529 --> 28:36.930
What the h--

28:41.536 --> 28:44.036
Richie! Where
the hell are you?

28:45.256 --> 28:46.622
Richie!

28:56.450 --> 28:58.134
Yahh! Uhh!

28:58.136 --> 29:00.854
Aaaaahhh!

29:00.856 --> 29:02.305
Uhh!

29:02.307 --> 29:04.724
Aaahh! Aaahhh!

29:04.726 --> 29:05.942
Help!

29:05.944 --> 29:07.660
Aaahh! Aaahh!

29:07.662 --> 29:09.312
Aaahh! Help!

29:09.314 --> 29:11.831
Aah! Aah! No! Ohh!

29:11.833 --> 29:14.067
Help me! Please!

29:15.652 --> 29:16.586
Aaahh--

29:28.665 --> 29:30.015
There's someone
in the elevator.

29:30.017 --> 29:31.517
They must've
left their rooms.

29:32.586 --> 29:33.886
I'll get this one.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.205
I guess I'm not
waiting on anything.

30:19.283 --> 30:20.767
Come on.

30:30.761 --> 30:31.694
Hello?

30:32.763 --> 30:33.696
Anybody here?

30:43.825 --> 30:44.824
Mmhh!

31:26.183 --> 31:28.067
So, why didn't
Christina come?

31:28.069 --> 31:29.201
I don't know.
She probably

31:29.203 --> 31:31.037
wanted to make out
with Kira.

31:31.039 --> 31:34.040
Why do homeless people
live here? It's disgusting.

31:35.777 --> 31:36.842
What's that?

31:37.978 --> 31:39.312
Opportunity
knocking.

31:40.381 --> 31:42.315
Or granny
and her vibrator.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.866
Ugh. That
was pathetic.

31:48.038 --> 31:49.972
He's only
gonna get worse.

31:52.876 --> 31:54.476
I gotta get
outta here.

32:00.551 --> 32:01.750
The windows
in the kitchen

32:01.752 --> 32:03.052
face out toward
the atrium.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.220
Yeah, but
don't they have--

32:04.222 --> 32:05.988
No. No bars.

32:07.557 --> 32:08.991
There's an opening
in the wall.

32:14.397 --> 32:15.998
It's gotta lead
somewhere, right?

32:17.067 --> 32:18.000
Dog got out.

32:31.832 --> 32:33.499
Okay. I'll stay
out here.

32:33.501 --> 32:34.967
The hole's
on the far wall

32:34.969 --> 32:36.269
in the atrium.

32:36.271 --> 32:38.988
If you stay low,
you should make it.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.573
I wish you'd
come with me.

32:40.575 --> 32:41.574
Just go.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.494
Okay.
Okay?

32:48.115 --> 32:49.032
Be careful.

32:50.467 --> 32:51.434
Okay, go.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.065
Ohh!

33:58.318 --> 33:59.302
The kitchen.

34:01.989 --> 34:03.622
What happened?

34:03.624 --> 34:06.993
I'm okay.
Just keep Williams out.

34:06.995 --> 34:08.194
Right.

34:12.333 --> 34:13.916
Michael?

34:13.918 --> 34:15.485
Why can't you
just leave me al--

34:19.757 --> 34:21.541
Shit.

34:21.543 --> 34:23.109
Ohh! Uhh!

34:27.813 --> 34:28.848
Ohh!

34:31.451 --> 34:33.953
Ohhhhhh!

34:33.955 --> 34:35.188
Aaaahhh!

34:36.524 --> 34:38.391
Ohh!

34:38.393 --> 34:40.326
Ohh!

34:40.328 --> 34:41.460
Uhh--Uhh! Uhh!

34:41.462 --> 34:43.062
Uhh! Ohhh!

34:43.063 --> 34:44.496
Ohh! Ohh! Aaahh!

34:44.498 --> 34:45.498
Damn it.
Kira!

34:47.235 --> 34:49.168
Aaaahhh!

34:49.170 --> 34:50.103
Help!

34:52.406 --> 34:53.406
Aaahh!

34:53.408 --> 34:54.840
Where does this lead to?

34:54.842 --> 34:56.074
It goes
to every floor.

34:56.077 --> 34:57.576
Who else is
in the hotel?

34:57.578 --> 35:00.213
Nobody. We cleared the homeless
out before you got here.

35:00.215 --> 35:02.615
Go make sure everybody else
is still in their rooms.

35:02.617 --> 35:05.251
Wait! Everyone else
went to the penthouses.

35:05.253 --> 35:06.685
That's off limits!
Damn it!

35:17.181 --> 35:18.697
Shit.

35:18.699 --> 35:21.701
Call 911. Anyone comes down, get
'em out of the building fast.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.335
I'm coming with you.

35:23.337 --> 35:25.604
Forget it. You wait
here for Hannah.

35:31.245 --> 35:32.445
What are you doin'?

35:32.447 --> 35:33.913
I said I'm
coming with you.

35:33.915 --> 35:35.714
Come on, hurry up!

35:39.486 --> 35:41.437
What happened to you?

35:41.439 --> 35:42.371
What?

35:44.124 --> 35:47.093
Nothing. That--
that's not even my--

35:50.247 --> 35:52.482
What the fuck
is going on?

35:57.470 --> 36:00.907
Anyone for some
interior redecorating?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.308
Oh, shit!

36:02.310 --> 36:04.811
You're gonna get us
caught, asshole!

36:04.813 --> 36:06.112
Fuck.

36:08.983 --> 36:10.749
By who? Captain Hook?

36:16.824 --> 36:17.756
Hey!

36:24.331 --> 36:25.564
Who needs therapy?

36:25.566 --> 36:26.632
Fuck.

36:29.002 --> 36:31.804
How many people
died up here?

36:39.162 --> 36:40.263
Stay close.

36:49.206 --> 36:50.439
Damn. Damn.

36:52.008 --> 36:53.942
Damn. Where in the hell
are stairs?

36:55.312 --> 36:57.179
Oh...shit!

36:57.181 --> 36:58.814
Oh...

37:07.091 --> 37:09.057
Come on, baby.
Open up.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.794
Come on.

37:18.034 --> 37:19.268
He took Richie.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.336
Calm down.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.837
He took Richie!

37:21.839 --> 37:22.905
What'd this guy
look like?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.690
Man, he's huge, man.

37:24.692 --> 37:25.975
He has a long, long chain,

37:25.977 --> 37:27.810
and a damn hole
in his head.

37:29.030 --> 37:30.830
What?

37:30.832 --> 37:31.831
What?

37:31.833 --> 37:33.398
No. It's not right.

37:35.468 --> 37:38.538
It can't be him.
I shot him in the head.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.406
Holy shit.

37:40.408 --> 37:42.575
Wait a minute.
You shot that freak

37:42.577 --> 37:44.810
that plucked all
those people's eyes out.

37:44.812 --> 37:48.481
Whoa. Wait. What the hell
does he want with Kira?

37:48.483 --> 37:49.515
I'm not sure.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.385
The last time,
he killed all

37:52.387 --> 37:53.836
of his victims
except one.

37:53.838 --> 37:56.089
I think he was
keepin' her

37:56.091 --> 37:57.856
because she had
tattoos.

37:57.858 --> 38:01.244
Stuff like crosses...
religious markings.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.978
Kira has religious
tattoos.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.046
Ohhh...damn.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.015
You think he killed
everybody else?

38:06.017 --> 38:07.816
Didn't Margaret
call the police?

38:07.818 --> 38:09.418
I don't know
that she could.

38:10.654 --> 38:11.888
We gotta move.

38:13.423 --> 38:15.491
He let
the other woman live.

38:15.493 --> 38:18.194
Take this.
Take the stairs.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.261
Whatever you guys
gotta do,

38:19.263 --> 38:21.397
just get the fuck
outta here.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.531
I'm goin' after Kira.

38:23.933 --> 38:25.834
Wait a minute!

38:25.836 --> 38:28.287
Wait! You can't
do this alone!

38:28.289 --> 38:30.423
You guys gotta go!

38:30.425 --> 38:31.724
Williams!

38:34.595 --> 38:36.178
Ohh! Aaahh!

38:36.180 --> 38:37.646
Williams! Shit!
Ohh!

38:38.715 --> 38:41.450
Aah! Williams!

38:42.720 --> 38:44.070
Oh, my God!

38:44.072 --> 38:45.688
Williams!

38:45.690 --> 38:46.622
Williams!

38:49.626 --> 38:51.460
You think
he got him?

38:51.462 --> 38:53.362
Williams! Aah!

38:59.403 --> 39:01.069
Shit!

39:02.072 --> 39:04.574
Come on!
Christine, Come on!

39:04.576 --> 39:05.458
We gotta go!

39:07.044 --> 39:08.277
No! Come on!

39:13.317 --> 39:15.117
Leave him alone!
Come on!

39:16.887 --> 39:19.388
What the hell
are you doin'?

39:19.390 --> 39:21.123
Sorry.

39:24.494 --> 39:25.494
Come on!

39:28.599 --> 39:29.832
Here. Take the Taser.

39:38.341 --> 39:39.475
Ah. Far sweet.

39:49.836 --> 39:51.036
Nice.

39:51.038 --> 39:53.606
Could you imagine
cleaning up in here?

39:57.861 --> 39:59.128
This could've been
a classy joint

39:59.130 --> 40:00.529
back in the day.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.797
What do youknow
about class?

40:02.866 --> 40:04.133
Oh my God.

40:04.135 --> 40:07.135
This place
is disgusting.

40:15.863 --> 40:18.180
At least we got
the sacred herb.

40:18.182 --> 40:20.315
Spark that shit.

40:26.422 --> 40:28.540
Let's go.

40:28.542 --> 40:33.212
And one for me.

40:33.214 --> 40:39.051
Try not to suck
it all down.

40:39.053 --> 40:43.572
So, you and Kira used
to be a thing, huh?

40:59.489 --> 41:04.125
You know, you
could do better.

41:04.127 --> 41:06.995
Here you go.

41:18.174 --> 41:20.776
I keep seeing things.

41:20.778 --> 41:23.078
I told you
this shit is gold.

41:24.981 --> 41:27.883
Let's find someplace private.

41:30.103 --> 41:32.238
Oh, shit, you go girl!

41:32.240 --> 41:34.140
Hey, wanna come?

41:38.511 --> 41:40.312
Oh, my God.

41:51.591 --> 41:55.627
Oh, God,
where are we going?

41:55.629 --> 41:56.862
Seventh floor.

41:56.864 --> 41:58.063
Why?

41:58.065 --> 42:00.632
Lucky number?

42:30.796 --> 42:33.765
Ah ha, the
maid's quarters?

42:33.767 --> 42:35.401
Romantic.

42:35.403 --> 42:36.902
You know what they say.

42:36.904 --> 42:39.104
Beggars can't be choosers.

42:39.106 --> 42:42.174
Who's begging?

43:27.704 --> 43:33.091
Richie? Richie?

43:41.134 --> 43:46.221
Help! Help!

43:53.680 --> 43:57.899
Somebody...

44:14.651 --> 44:20.172
What do you want?

44:22.960 --> 44:25.427
What do you want?

44:33.102 --> 44:34.803
Richie!

44:36.773 --> 44:39.975
Richie!

44:42.278 --> 44:45.381
No!

44:45.383 --> 44:48.000
No!

44:48.002 --> 44:53.154
Please...please.

45:01.464 --> 45:03.649
Did you say something?

45:03.651 --> 45:07.702
You know...

45:07.704 --> 45:10.139
We're all alone up here.

45:16.179 --> 45:21.183
You remember when I said that
you could do better than Kira?

45:21.185 --> 45:23.419
Mmm hmm.

45:23.421 --> 45:28.306
Well, I didn't mean
this much better.

45:32.245 --> 45:35.180
Oh, my God.
That's so pathetic.

45:36.683 --> 45:37.883
Oh! My phone!

45:37.885 --> 45:39.885
I'm having my sister up.

45:39.887 --> 45:42.421
Where did you get a cell?

45:42.423 --> 45:43.939
Duh, I took
it from Hannah.

45:43.941 --> 45:46.007
Hey, bitch, what's up?

45:46.009 --> 45:49.294
Eh, no, yeah, save
this number tonight.

45:49.296 --> 45:51.246
This is the cell
that I'm using, okay?

45:51.248 --> 45:54.315
Fuck this.

45:54.317 --> 45:59.320
Oh my God, no, it's just this
total bonehead called Michael.

45:59.322 --> 46:01.489
He thinks he's
such a badass.

46:37.527 --> 46:39.845
Do you see the sin?

46:52.091 --> 46:54.342
Open your eyes.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.311
Open your eyes and
wash the sins out.

47:31.965 --> 47:36.134
What ya got in here?

48:40.382 --> 48:42.117
Russell, hold up.

48:42.119 --> 48:43.585
What?

48:43.587 --> 48:44.620
You're kidding, right?

48:44.622 --> 48:46.704
No, wait.

48:46.706 --> 48:49.307
There's something weird
about that mirror.

48:49.309 --> 48:51.976
Let me up.

48:51.978 --> 48:55.313
Mirror...I'll check it out.

48:59.153 --> 49:02.921
Damn. You know what?

49:02.923 --> 49:04.640
This is a two-way mirror.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.975
What?

49:09.830 --> 49:12.898
Get out! Go!

49:24.460 --> 49:27.095
Ssh.

49:40.877 --> 49:44.779
What the fuck was that?

49:52.521 --> 49:55.757
No bars.

49:55.759 --> 49:57.926
We can get down to
the entry room from here.

49:57.928 --> 49:59.527
Okay.

50:15.945 --> 50:17.762
It's not tight enough.

50:17.764 --> 50:19.764
It'll get tighter
when you hang on it.

50:19.766 --> 50:21.466
I'll get stuck
on the glass roof.

50:21.468 --> 50:24.002
Just kick it out.
You'll be fine.

50:24.004 --> 50:27.071
Okay? You'll be fine.

50:32.945 --> 50:34.846
Oh, God, I can't do this.

50:34.848 --> 50:36.214
You have to.

50:39.685 --> 50:41.703
God.

50:57.186 --> 51:00.639
Oh, God!
Russell, go slow.

51:00.641 --> 51:05.294
Okay.

51:05.296 --> 51:08.397
It's all right.

51:12.535 --> 51:16.338
Russell, stop.

51:19.758 --> 51:24.445
Russell? Russell!

51:24.447 --> 51:26.915
Russell, what was that?

51:26.917 --> 51:29.718
Russell, where are you?

51:29.720 --> 51:32.821
Russell. Why are you
pulling me up?

51:32.823 --> 51:33.705
Russell, stop.

51:40.930 --> 51:42.564
No!

51:46.336 --> 51:48.770
Stop! Let go!

51:48.772 --> 51:51.206
Let go of me!

51:51.208 --> 51:54.175
Stop! Let me go!

52:04.704 --> 52:07.889
Let me go.
Let me down.

52:07.891 --> 52:12.627
Please let me down!

52:12.629 --> 52:18.633
Let me go.

52:18.635 --> 52:23.905
Let me go!

52:23.907 --> 52:25.924
No!

53:00.359 --> 53:03.361
Oh, God.

53:26.469 --> 53:28.320
Tease.

53:28.322 --> 53:31.489
Tease? Michael,
do you even have a car?

53:31.491 --> 53:33.524
You skank.

53:33.526 --> 53:37.528
What the fuck?

53:37.530 --> 53:39.097
It's stuck.

53:39.099 --> 53:43.234
Move.

53:43.236 --> 53:45.503
It's stuck.

53:45.505 --> 53:46.504
No shit.

53:46.506 --> 53:49.440
God damn it.

53:49.442 --> 53:53.144
Yeah, hang on a sec, will
you, just give me a second.

53:53.146 --> 53:56.981
So. Where's the
elevator, Columbus?

53:56.983 --> 53:58.016
Get off the phone.

53:58.018 --> 53:59.184
No!

53:59.186 --> 54:02.487
I'm not Kira, Mike.

54:02.489 --> 54:06.774
Yeah, I don't know, some really
stupid hotel with a retard.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.437
Oh, gross. Where the
hell are they coming from?

54:19.439 --> 54:21.973
Oh, my God, shit.

54:27.112 --> 54:29.414
Oh my God.

54:31.316 --> 54:32.918
Shit. Fuck.

56:39.629 --> 56:41.278
No!

56:41.280 --> 56:42.613
Oh my God!

56:42.615 --> 56:44.915
Oh, please, no!

56:48.120 --> 56:50.021
Michael! Michael, please!

56:51.358 --> 56:53.124
Help me!

56:55.094 --> 56:56.727
Please, God!
Please help me!

56:59.815 --> 57:02.250
It's annoying...the sin.

57:02.252 --> 57:04.736
Do you see the sin?

57:10.193 --> 57:12.260
Did you look at them?

57:12.262 --> 57:14.595
Did you see the sin?

57:14.597 --> 57:16.213
Do you see their sin?

57:16.215 --> 57:18.499
Look into their eyes.

57:18.501 --> 57:20.234
Oh my God!

57:20.236 --> 57:23.187
The eyes are the window of the soul.

57:23.189 --> 57:25.256
Michael!

58:11.370 --> 58:12.470
Come on, shit!

58:12.472 --> 58:14.405
It won't fuckin' open!

58:18.276 --> 58:19.577
What the fuck, man?

58:19.579 --> 58:21.579
It doesn't matter, we're
going after Kira anyway.

58:23.249 --> 58:24.582
He's coming.

58:24.584 --> 58:26.383
We're trapped!

58:26.385 --> 58:27.718
We're gonna fucking die!

58:27.720 --> 58:29.053
Shoot him!

58:29.055 --> 58:31.239
Fuck!

58:31.241 --> 58:33.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:37.379 --> 58:38.580
Michael?

58:38.582 --> 58:40.748
Jesus Christ!

58:40.750 --> 58:44.586
What's wrong
with you idiots?

59:02.938 --> 59:04.472
What the hell is this?

59:04.474 --> 59:06.724
Looks like some
kind of trip wire.

59:16.969 --> 59:19.119
He took Richie
into the elevator.

59:35.322 --> 59:39.273
All right, motherfucker.

59:47.950 --> 59:50.935
Christine, come on!

59:50.937 --> 59:53.270
Let's go, we gotta
get out of here!

59:56.057 --> 59:59.994
Michael!
Come on!

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.916
Damn, he broke it!

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.171
Oh, shit!

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.106
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.807
We gotta go up.

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.376
Hurry up!

01:00:19.648 --> 01:00:21.699
Shit!

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.801
Help me up!
Pull me up, come on!

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:26.571
Quick, grab my hand.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.871
Go, come on, go.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.940
Come on, go, go.

01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:51.379
Come on,
let's go this way.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.415
Kira!

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:57.118
Oh...God.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.454
Kira!

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.272
Shit, the other elevator.

01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:02.173
Kira!

01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:03.207
Help!

01:01:03.209 --> 01:01:04.775
Come on.

01:01:04.777 --> 01:01:05.960
Help me.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.612
She's in here.

01:01:08.614 --> 01:01:09.781
Shit.

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:14.485
Come on, Tye!

01:01:19.408 --> 01:01:22.410
Holy shit.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.262
Look at all this money.

01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:27.048
I'll be damn, Richie Rich.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.517
It really was a safe.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.486
Look at all this damn money.

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.354
Oh my God.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:40.111
Are these human eyes?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.495
Help!

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:45.766
Kira?

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:46.801
Kira?

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.769
Help, please!

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.972
Tye, she's in here,
come on!

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:53.608
Come on, Tye.

01:01:58.747 --> 01:02:00.615
Kira...are you in here?

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:01.616
Hurry!

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.429
Oh God, Christine,
get me out of here.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:18.916
Move quick!

01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:21.385
How?

01:02:21.387 --> 01:02:22.386
The keys.

01:02:22.388 --> 01:02:23.887
They're over there
on the table.

01:02:23.889 --> 01:02:25.756
Oh! Richie.

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:27.491
He's coming, come on!

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:30.261
I gotta go.
I'm gonna come back, okay?

01:02:30.263 --> 01:02:31.795
Don't leave me.

01:02:50.815 --> 01:02:52.683
I wish you'd just kill me.

01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:00.925
We gotta draw him out.

01:03:00.927 --> 01:03:03.061
What do you mean
we gotta draw him out?

01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:06.130
We gotta get his attention.
Make some noise or something.

01:03:06.132 --> 01:03:09.734
Come on, Tye, this
is our only chance.

01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:31.655
Oh, you pig!

01:03:31.657 --> 01:03:35.592
You're sick.
You're fucking sick!

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.935
You filthy little pig.

01:03:44.937 --> 01:03:47.722
You enjoy this,
don't you?

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.557
Oh, I can tell you do.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.241
I see that.

01:03:51.243 --> 01:03:52.660
I see what you're doing.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.646
Stop it.

01:04:02.721 --> 01:04:04.055
No.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:13.514
Oh, no.

01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:51.084
Okay, Kira.

01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:53.086
Where are the keys?

01:04:53.088 --> 01:04:57.224
He took them.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.659
Shit.

01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:42.720
This'll work.

01:05:42.722 --> 01:05:46.891
Come on.

01:05:46.893 --> 01:05:48.292
Hurry.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.374
Tye.

01:06:04.376 --> 01:06:05.910
Hurry.

01:06:19.107 --> 01:06:21.709
Open the cage!

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.561
Christine!

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:25.830
Shit.

01:06:32.037 --> 01:06:35.106
Oh, Margaret, Margaret.
Thank God.

01:06:39.511 --> 01:06:41.178
What are you
doing in there?

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.946
There's this guy,
and he's just...

01:06:42.948 --> 01:06:46.150
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.808 --> 01:06:55.309
I'd like you to tell me.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:59.229
Why is that whore
still alive?

01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.666
What? No.

01:07:02.668 --> 01:07:05.435
Why is she still alive?

01:07:05.437 --> 01:07:07.270
You know him?

01:07:07.272 --> 01:07:10.240
Know him?
Ha ha, he's my son.

01:07:10.242 --> 01:07:13.911
He's the hand of God.

01:07:13.913 --> 01:07:15.663
You got us here
to help you.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:16.847
Help me?

01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:19.750
No. Williams was
the one I wanted.

01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:21.952
Found him.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:25.856
He hurt my boy.

01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:29.577
You were a bonus.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:31.779
Why here?

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.947
What better place
to do God's work?

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.851
<i>The hotel caters
deviants, sinners,</i>

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:38.652
<i>and the ones
that hear voices.</i>

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:41.588
There's only one
voice to hear.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.557
And that's the voice of God.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.942
And He's told
you what to do!

01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:54.017
Are you fucking insane!

01:07:54.019 --> 01:07:56.487
This is not what God wants!

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.422
Don't you see...the tattoos.

01:07:58.424 --> 01:08:00.924
Don't you see the sin?
The tattoos are blasphemy.

01:08:00.926 --> 01:08:02.593
Don't you see it?

01:08:05.564 --> 01:08:08.465
She doesn't know God.
Don't you see it?

01:08:08.467 --> 01:08:10.183
Don't you see the sin?

01:08:10.185 --> 01:08:11.752
You understand,
don't you?

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.821
That's why you killed the others;
now it's her turn.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:14.822
Judge her.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.090
No.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.424
Judge her.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.193
- No.
- Judge her.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.111
Open your eyes.
Judge her.

01:08:21.113 --> 01:08:23.781
And wash the sins out.
Judge her.

01:08:23.783 --> 01:08:25.032
Once your soul's clean,

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.667
you'll be the hand of God.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:28.786
No.
Judge her.

01:08:28.787 --> 01:08:30.504
No!

01:08:34.759 --> 01:08:35.959
Fine.

01:08:37.127 --> 01:08:39.895
I'll do it for you.

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.098
Oh, shit!

01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:43.500
Because I can see.

01:08:44.835 --> 01:08:47.071
Oh, please, no!

01:08:47.073 --> 01:08:48.904
Please, God, help!

01:08:48.907 --> 01:08:50.640
No!

01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:52.008
And I...

01:08:53.243 --> 01:08:55.812
will not fail God.

01:08:55.814 --> 01:08:57.081
Jacob!

01:08:57.082 --> 01:08:58.881
What are you doing?
Let me go!

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:00.434
Let go!

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.586
You ungrateful bastard!

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:04.020
You hear me?

01:09:04.023 --> 01:09:05.790
Don't you see
the sin?

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:23.790
I want my mama.

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.511
Please!
You brought this home?

01:09:28.514 --> 01:09:29.979
Don't you see
what she is?

01:09:29.982 --> 01:09:31.148
Look at her.
Look at her.

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:32.733
Look at her!

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.335
Damn you!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.885
Let go!

01:09:35.886 --> 01:09:37.087
You ungrateful bastard!

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:40.357
Haven't you learned
anything?

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:41.224
Bastard, you hear me?

01:09:41.225 --> 01:09:43.710
Don't you see the evil
in her eyes?

01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:53.120
No, no!

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.554
You don't see it?

01:09:54.556 --> 01:09:57.874
Maybe you just need to take
a closer look at them.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.881
Look!
Look at it.

01:10:04.883 --> 01:10:05.683
See that?

01:10:05.685 --> 01:10:07.718
Have a good look
at it.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.169
Look.

01:10:25.136 --> 01:10:28.305
I see it.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:29.472
What?

01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:55.099
Please, no!

01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:57.500
You don't have to do this.

01:11:07.245 --> 01:11:08.278
No! No!

01:11:11.649 --> 01:11:13.617
No!

01:12:41.455 --> 01:12:43.523
Christine?

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:44.892
He's out of it.

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.076
Can you move?

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.036
Okay.

01:13:18.075 --> 01:13:20.761
Come on, Christine.

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.546
Do it!

01:13:22.548 --> 01:13:23.647
Shoot him!

01:14:02.754 --> 01:14:04.154
Michael!

01:14:04.156 --> 01:14:05.922
Come on,
let's go!

01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:13.546
Run!

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:25.726
In here!

01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.367
Christine!

01:14:51.369 --> 01:14:53.103
Michael. Michael.

01:15:32.743 --> 01:15:34.244
Michael!

01:15:34.246 --> 01:15:35.412
Watch out!

01:15:49.227 --> 01:15:51.594
You okay?

01:15:51.596 --> 01:15:52.962
Yeah.

01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:01.271
No!

01:16:04.659 --> 01:16:05.659
No!

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.127
Fall, you prick!

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.194
No!

01:16:10.698 --> 01:16:11.681
No!

01:16:21.659 --> 01:16:23.326
Fuck you!

01:17:32.131 --> 01:17:33.897
Let's go.

01:17:54.969 --> 01:17:59.406
Michael, you didn't have
to come back for us.

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:04.611
I didn't want to walk
out of here alone.
