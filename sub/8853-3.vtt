WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:02.800
There's definitely
something in there.

00:02.860 --> 00:04.570
Okay, just
tell me what happened.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.700
Well, I was watching
<i>hell date</i> as usual last night,

00:06.770 --> 00:09.700
and I was eating pretzel rods,
and I passed out.

00:09.770 --> 00:11.370
So I think I,
like, rolled on one

00:11.440 --> 00:13.240
and it broke off
in my ear or something.

00:13.310 --> 00:14.880
Maybe I've just been punching
you in your sleep, dude.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.110
Did you think about that maybe?

00:16.180 --> 00:18.010
That doesn't make any sense.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.380
Oh, it makes more sense
than you even know, Anders.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.480
Well, so have you then?

00:20.550 --> 00:21.620
- Okay.
- Maybe.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.180
All right, just stay still,

00:23.250 --> 00:25.790
because I definitely
see something in there.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.420
- Well, get it out!
- Okay, okay.

00:27.490 --> 00:28.890
Just take some deep breaths.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.720
Adam, can you hand me
those tweezers, please?

00:30.790 --> 00:32.259
What do you need
tweezers for, man? Just...

00:32.330 --> 00:34.160
- Tweeze me.
- Thank you.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.530
All right now, just hold still.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.300
I don't wanna
rupture any vessels.

00:38.370 --> 00:39.600
What?

00:39.670 --> 00:40.700
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.040
What?
What is it?

00:42.100 --> 00:43.270
- What's in there?

00:43.340 --> 00:44.940
What is it?
What? What is it?

00:45.010 --> 00:47.340
It's a baby cockroach!

Well, that's fine.
Fine.

01:15.770 --> 01:16.940
No, okay, well, I guess
we're not doing business.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.340
Check out our house,

01:18.410 --> 01:19.370
it looks like
a total circus tent.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.210
Ugh.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.810
That looks like
a poisonous death trap, dude.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.210
- How's that?
- If I were a kid,

01:24.280 --> 01:25.780
that's exactly
where I would hide.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.310
Instead of, like,
making awesome circus tents

01:27.380 --> 01:28.780
that kids wanna hide in,

01:28.850 --> 01:30.920
they should just write
"homework store" on it,

01:30.990 --> 01:32.420
or "homework town."

01:32.490 --> 01:33.650
Kids don't wanna
go to homework town.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.620
Dead kid problem solved.

01:35.690 --> 01:39.490
Yeah, or then we'd have
some dead, really smart kids.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.730
Well, maybe if you guys
didn't treat our house

01:41.800 --> 01:43.460
like the piss ditch
at burning man,

01:43.530 --> 01:45.400
we wouldn't have
to get it fumigated.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.570
Ders.
You're the bedtime maniac

01:46.630 --> 01:47.840
who passes out with pretzels

01:47.900 --> 01:49.240
and wakes up
with little brain bugs.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.570
Nevertheless...

01:50.640 --> 01:51.810
We have nowhere
to sleep for three days.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.540
Come on, guys,
this is our chance

01:53.610 --> 01:55.780
to take that camping trip
we've never talked about.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.280
Yeah, let's buckle up
for some high-speed bro bondage.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.550
Yeah, it's free, it's fun,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.320
and you just might
learn something.

02:02.380 --> 02:03.780
Excuse me,
could you move this box

02:03.850 --> 02:05.250
so I can get to the outlet?

02:05.320 --> 02:07.550
No prob, Bob.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.960
It's Bret.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.620
No sweat, Bret.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.530
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

02:12.590 --> 02:14.930
Look at this.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.430
Finally found a t-shirt
that's gonna house

02:16.500 --> 02:18.670
those bodacious "c" cups
of yours, ders.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.030
Come on, give me
a little shake, baby.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.240
Come on, mama.
Shake it for us.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.140
Yeah!
Shake, shake, shake it.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.140
- Yeah.
- How does he do that?

02:27.210 --> 02:29.840
- Uh, magnificent.
- Whoo, whoo!

02:29.910 --> 02:32.150
And let's give one
to Bret here.

02:32.210 --> 02:33.510
It's a parting gift.
Thanks, buddy.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.820
- Thank you.
- You earned it.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.650
Oh, that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

02:38.720 --> 02:41.820
This nerd show up
for one day to do my job,

02:41.890 --> 02:44.090
I'm here every day...

02:44.160 --> 02:45.730
y'all never
gave me a t-shirt.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.060
Montez, that's because
you're not an I.T. Guy.

02:47.130 --> 02:48.960
Okay, I'm not an I.T. Guy.

02:49.030 --> 02:51.330
All right, who took that
pornado off his computer? Hmm?

02:51.400 --> 02:53.630
Who sent y'all
all them dope web videos?

02:53.700 --> 02:54.670
Remember that
<i>chocolate rain,</i> huh?

02:54.740 --> 02:56.140
What about that gif

02:56.200 --> 02:57.240
where the penguin fell
through the ice?

02:57.310 --> 02:58.410
- Yeah.
- Remember that one?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.910
And that Leroy Jenkins joint?

02:59.970 --> 03:02.510
That was next level.
Yeah, that was good.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.910
But it came out,
like, five years ago.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.380
You don't respect the classics.

03:06.450 --> 03:09.020
What's next, he gonna
butt[Bleep] Mozart?

03:09.080 --> 03:10.820
- Ew.
- Here you go.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.990
I appreciate it.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.630
Waymond,
look what they gave me.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.460
Nuh, ah! That's not for you.
Come on.

03:20.530 --> 03:22.600
You always trying to
get stuff that's not yours.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.800
- That was nice of you.
- Thanks, buddy.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.370
- Good job.
- Oh!

03:27.440 --> 03:29.300
You okay?

03:29.370 --> 03:31.970
Here, spit it out.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.180
Are you ready to go
camping tonight, brother?

03:35.240 --> 03:38.750
Roger that, ranger Rick.
We are all set.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.650
Got those shrooms from Carl
that he brought from chico.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.750
I'm talking brain melter.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.420
I don't even know
if I wanna do any.

03:46.490 --> 03:49.260
- What?
- I'm scared.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.620
You know what,
I'll do a couple.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.990
Ha ha!
That's my guy.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.460
One or two.
Not too many, though.

03:53.530 --> 03:56.400
I wanna be appropriate
with those, for sure.

03:56.460 --> 03:59.330
- Wanna do some right now?
- Hey.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.270
- Hey, dickholes.
- Alice, hey.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.970
So I don't know if
you've heard this or not,

04:03.040 --> 04:04.740
but there's been
a series of burglaries

04:04.810 --> 04:06.370
in cars in the area.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.910
Anyway, we're gonna
be beefing up security,

04:07.980 --> 04:09.780
so I just wanted
to let you know that.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.580
I hope they don't
put any language alarms in,

04:11.650 --> 04:13.650
because you cuss a lot.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.480
You won't need
too much extra security,

04:15.550 --> 04:17.880
because we've already got
Sirs ve and Lance right here.

04:17.950 --> 04:20.990
Sirs ve, Lance, ve.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.590
What the
Does that mean?

04:22.660 --> 04:24.630
Anyways, I could
walk you to your car tonight

04:24.690 --> 04:26.730

about the burglars.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.230
Wow.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.330
actually, that
would be really great.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.270

No, you [Bleep]Head.
Of course not.

04:37.340 --> 04:38.470

12-year-old

04:38.540 --> 04:40.240
is really gonna
spook away any bad guys?

04:40.310 --> 04:43.110
I don't think so.
Four-foot-tall 12-year-old...

08:39.820 --> 08:42.020
We could start robbing
the place ourselves,

08:42.080 --> 08:43.820
and then when we see
the burglars we can be like,

08:43.890 --> 08:45.050
"what are you guys doing here?
You guys are burglaring this?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.550

we had this today."

08:53.730 --> 08:55.200
Okay, no.
All right?

08:55.260 --> 08:56.900

08:56.970 --> 08:58.400
we have broken more laws
than the burglars.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.400
We're trespassing,
I did some things

09:00.470 --> 09:02.240
in the girls bathroom
I shouldn't talk about,

09:02.300 --> 09:04.640
and we have a ton of drugs.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.070
Do we? I can
take care of that for us.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.380
Teamwork for my friends.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.710
Okay, is that the smartest
thing to do right now?

09:10.780 --> 09:12.680
Get more shroomed out?
Mm-hmm.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.380
Ders, this is our night
at the museum, okay?

09:15.450 --> 09:18.750
And this exhibit,
he's coming to life.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.390
How many shrooms
have you dropped?

09:20.460 --> 09:21.890
- A lot.
- How many?

09:21.960 --> 09:23.520
How many shrooms
have you dropped?

09:23.590 --> 09:25.690
How many shrooms
have you dropped?

09:25.760 --> 09:28.500
- A lot.
- Hey, I've got it.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.760
It's so obvious,
it's so simple,

09:30.830 --> 09:32.170
they'll never see it coming.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.340
Let's walk right out
the front door.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.570
Blake!

09:35.640 --> 09:37.070
You're the smartest guy I know.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.910
You're like bo Jackson.
Adam...

09:38.970 --> 09:42.040
Inside voices.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.720
Oh, my God, we're dead.
We're dead, we're dead.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.150
We're not gonna
get murdered, ders.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.820
We're not gonna
get stabbed repeatedly

09:53.890 --> 09:55.460
in the face and body,
and left for dead.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.090
Adam, the entire building
is locked down.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.630
The front door's
the only way out.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.430
I think one of those guys
had a gun on his person.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.130
No, that's it.
It's so obvious, it's so simple.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.830
They'll never see it coming.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.400
We go through the biggest
front door of them all...

10:06.470 --> 10:07.740
The roof.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.650
Let's go.

10:17.710 --> 10:21.320
Shh.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.250
Okay, cool,
where's the fire escape?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.890
Well, there is no fire escape,

10:25.950 --> 10:28.090
but maybe you've heard
of the classic tale

10:28.160 --> 10:30.120
by...Who wrote <i>Rapunzel?</i>

10:30.190 --> 10:31.760
What are you talking about?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.130
Whatever, I'll jump.
I don't care, dude.

10:33.190 --> 10:34.630
- Please do.
- No, no, I'm serious.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.860
Like, we should ponytail
our clothes together,

10:36.930 --> 10:38.600
and rapunzel down.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.570
- You mean rappel.
- No, rapunzel.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.170
Actually, curiously,

10:42.240 --> 10:43.470
that's where the
word "rappel" comes from.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.340
"Rapunzel."
No, it's not.

10:45.410 --> 10:46.910
But that's not
a bad idea; I'm in.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.080
Okay.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.850
Are you guys cold?

10:52.910 --> 10:54.780
What?
They're spanx, all right?

10:54.850 --> 10:56.480
Haven't been
to the gym a lot lately

10:56.550 --> 10:57.950
and they keep me tight.
Is that why you're flexing?

10:58.020 --> 11:00.190
I'm not flexing
right now, dude.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.020
Are you flexing?
Definitely not flexing.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.760
- You're flexing for sure.
- No, you're flexing.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.060
- You're flexing, dude.
- I'm not flexing right now.

11:05.130 --> 11:06.960
I'm a stress eater.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.160
And I've been eating
a lot lately,

11:08.230 --> 11:09.530
so I need spanx.
Okay, yes.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.130
Are you okay with that?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.230
You're stress eating
some high-class boomers.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.900
I need you focused.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.870
Fine, I'm
the best thrower anyway.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.110
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't!

11:19.170 --> 11:21.210
What are you doing?
Stop!

11:21.280 --> 11:25.110
Stop!
Stop, stop!

11:25.180 --> 11:28.650
Stop it, Adam!
Stop!

11:28.720 --> 11:30.620
Sto... you're
not listening!

11:38.430 --> 11:40.360
We start bringing
guns to work, man.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.500
Then we wouldn't have
this issue, like, ever.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.130
We would just be like,
"you're robbing us?"

11:44.200 --> 11:45.900
Yeah, absolutely.

11:45.970 --> 11:49.440
Guns are at least
two-handed swords.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.700
Sword?
Cut me, bro.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.470
Cut me...
bro.

11:52.540 --> 11:56.980
♪ Cause I'm a stabbin' dude
with raditude ♪

11:57.050 --> 11:58.650
♪ do, do, do, do, do, do, do ♪

11:58.710 --> 12:00.080
Shut up.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.750
Are you trying
to get me killed?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.750
- Are you flexing again?
- No.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.420
You look like you are.

12:05.490 --> 12:06.820
I'm not flexing
right now, you are.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.520
Yeah, I always am.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.090
And you need to take
some time out of your day

12:10.160 --> 12:11.690
and work on your body,

12:11.760 --> 12:13.560
'cause it's
an embarrassment, bro.

12:13.630 --> 12:16.860
Come on, let's go.
We're not safe here anymore.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.300
Whoa.
I just got an awesome idea.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.640
Stop it.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.940
Those shrooms you made me take

12:23.000 --> 12:24.710
are making me
sick to my stomach.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brother.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.470
Those shrooms
were all you, buddy.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.540
Ders, succumbing
to peer pressure.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.580
What's new, ders?
I don't do that.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.210
- What's new, ders?
- We have to get out of here.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.080
We have to go!
Can fly in this thing.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.820
- Adam, you can't fly.
- I'm like one of

12:37.890 --> 12:40.420
those dragons
from <i>Avatar,</i> remember?

12:40.490 --> 12:41.790
They flew on them.
They were like...

12:45.260 --> 12:47.290
Adam, stop.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.560
Adam, I cannot
handle this any more.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.070
I'm gonna go wait
in the bathroom.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.800
Stop it.
I'm going to the bathroom.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.900
Bye-bye.
T-T-Y-L.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.270
Lol. Jk.
Give me the stapler.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.240
Not about to be
the only guy without it.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.140
- How many?
- Two.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.210
There you go again,
overachieving.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.950
Miss you, dude.

13:08.020 --> 13:12.820
Ahh.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.720
Oh, man,
that's cool-looking.

13:35.340 --> 13:38.950
God damn it.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.410
I got you, baby.

14:01.450 --> 14:03.020
Whoa.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.560
Dude, he just sent me
a picture of a knife.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.890
I think he might
really be in trouble.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.090
Oh, my God, a photo of a knife?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.660
Terrifying.

14:11.730 --> 14:13.200
I've got about
two more hours on this

14:13.260 --> 14:15.100
and then we'll get to go home.

14:15.170 --> 14:16.870
Okay?
Believe in me.

14:16.930 --> 14:20.300
Adam, you know our motto.

14:20.370 --> 14:24.540
No ders left behind.

14:24.610 --> 14:26.880
The thing about ders is...

14:26.940 --> 14:30.080
He's supposed to die tonight.

14:30.150 --> 14:33.580
I'm on a real spiritual high
right now, brother.

14:33.650 --> 14:35.620
Real high.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.250
It's the prophecy.

14:38.320 --> 14:42.630
It was foretold, like,
a 1,000 years before dinosaurs.

14:42.690 --> 14:45.960
And as cool as that sounds,

14:46.030 --> 14:51.630
how awesome would it be
to deny the prophecy?

14:56.310 --> 14:58.710
Let's do it for the dinosaurs.

14:58.780 --> 15:02.380
What does that mean?

15:02.450 --> 15:03.910
I think that means
let's go save ders.

15:03.980 --> 15:04.850
- All right.
- Okay.

15:13.590 --> 15:15.890
Well, well, well.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.390
The server room.
What are these guys up to?

15:22.330 --> 15:24.730
Jackpot.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.500
This is bigger than we thought.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.190
No, please don't cut me.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.350
You came back.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.520
I almost just killed you.

15:47.590 --> 15:48.990
Are you okay?

15:49.060 --> 15:50.390
I've been nothing but worried.

15:50.460 --> 15:51.460
I shouldn't have left you guys.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.060
You guys are my rocks.

15:53.130 --> 15:54.460
Thank you.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.500
Look, we are not safe here.

15:56.570 --> 15:58.670
No one's safe.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.270
They got in the server room,
hacked into the networks.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.340
I know I'm really high
right now, guys,

16:03.410 --> 16:04.940
but I don't think
I'm exaggerating

16:05.010 --> 16:07.810
when I say this goes all
the way up to the vice president

16:07.880 --> 16:11.180
of the continental
United States of America.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.480
Biden.

16:12.550 --> 16:14.020
How are we
gonna get out of here?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.490
We aren't.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.020
We've gotta
stand up for justice.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.620
We're gonna protect what's ours

16:19.690 --> 16:21.220
and take back
what we never had,

16:21.290 --> 16:23.690
because if the history channel
taught us anything

16:23.760 --> 16:26.130
besides the culture
of ice road trucking,

16:26.200 --> 16:30.700
it's that history defines
men by moments and.

16:30.770 --> 16:33.940
And gentledudes,
this is our moment.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.510
Because if we don't
learn from history channel...

16:37.570 --> 16:39.880
We're doomed to repeat
history channel.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.110
Let's go kill these dudes.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.110
I didn't cry for no reason.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.520
Okay, so what're
we looking at here?

16:47.580 --> 16:49.420
This is the burglar Buster.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.990
It's basically the eliminator
from <i>American gladiators,</i>

16:52.060 --> 16:54.220
mixed with all the cool
laser parts from <i>entrapment...</i>

16:54.290 --> 16:56.360
you know, the
Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle.

16:56.430 --> 16:57.860
Yeah, it's a classic.

16:57.930 --> 16:59.730
But how do we know
this is going to work?

16:59.800 --> 17:03.930
Because it was
designed by the best.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.970
♪ Catherine Zeta-Jones ♪

17:07.040 --> 17:09.839
♪ she dips beneath lasers ♪

17:09.910 --> 17:12.480
♪ ooh ♪

17:12.540 --> 17:14.579
I'll get on the P.A.
To get their attention,

17:14.650 --> 17:16.180
then using Adam as bait,

17:16.250 --> 17:18.510
we lure them
through our gauntlet.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.619
First up, the lazer jungle.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.849
What's that supposed to do?

17:21.920 --> 17:23.790
Physically?
Nothing.

17:23.849 --> 17:27.319
But mentally...
Total destruction.

17:27.390 --> 17:31.030
Ooh, I like that.

17:31.090 --> 17:34.760
Then Adam triggers the
water jug pendulums of death,

17:34.830 --> 17:36.930
driving them into...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.800
Our ether-net.

17:38.870 --> 17:42.540
Which, you guessed it,
is a net of ethernet cables.

17:42.610 --> 17:44.910
And if these guys happen
to be super-shredder status

17:44.980 --> 17:46.540
and get through all of that,

17:46.610 --> 17:49.010
then I'll be there with
our last line of defense...

17:49.080 --> 17:51.750
just plain old
sharpened broomsticks.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.150
Just like that scene
in <i>Braveheart.</i>

18:13.830 --> 18:15.160
All right, let's do this.

18:15.230 --> 18:16.630
We're doing it.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.400
Warning.

18:19.470 --> 18:22.240
You have activated
the laser alarm system.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.540
These are not laser pointers.

18:24.610 --> 18:27.580
They're real lasers
that burn through human flesh.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.110
You're probably like...
Lasers in an office buil...

18:31.180 --> 18:32.780
Anyways, you should
be really freaked out.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.050
Adam, that's your cue.

18:35.120 --> 18:42.220
Leroy Jenkins!

18:43.360 --> 18:44.460
God damn it, Leroy.

18:44.530 --> 18:46.490
Sorry, I had to do it.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.030
I'm kind of a Maverick

18:48.100 --> 18:49.730
and I just don't
give a shoot, you know?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.130
You guys feel me though, right?

18:51.200 --> 18:54.500
I feel you.
You're like my new hero.

18:54.570 --> 18:55.670
Maybe we should tie them up.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.540
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.170
So you thought you
could just come in here

18:59.240 --> 19:00.640
and throw down on our turf?

19:00.710 --> 19:02.640
On our turf?
That's what you thought?

19:02.710 --> 19:03.980
I guess you guys
forgot to expect

19:04.050 --> 19:05.750
the unexpected!

19:05.810 --> 19:07.880
Like I said,
I'm with tech support.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.520
I met you, like, six hours ago.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.320
This is my part...
this is my partner, Cory.

19:12.390 --> 19:15.420
Oh, very clever.

19:15.490 --> 19:16.920
So you come in during the day

19:16.990 --> 19:18.930
hidden in plain sight
to case the joint.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.060
You are not
gonna get the codes.

19:21.130 --> 19:23.900
But you will tell us
what Joe biden's after.

19:23.970 --> 19:25.370
What does Joe biden want?

19:25.430 --> 19:26.830
Please, just don't hurt us.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.600
Us hurt you?

19:28.670 --> 19:30.140
That's hilarious,
we're not the ones

19:30.210 --> 19:31.840
dropping knives in bathrooms.

19:31.910 --> 19:34.310
That's right, I was
in there watching you.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.150
I carry a knife with me
because I was sexually assaulted

19:37.210 --> 19:39.210
in a mall food court
last spring.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.420
Sorry I like to feel protected.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.020
I'm sorry.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.620
We're just here
to reboot the system.

19:43.690 --> 19:45.150
We can't... we can't
do it during the day

19:45.220 --> 19:46.290
when the servers are in use.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.990
- Right!
- Yeah.

19:48.060 --> 19:51.030
Okay! Like I can't
test your little lie, buddy?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.830
I can just open up
a program right here...

19:52.900 --> 19:55.260
Holy [Bleep], this is fast.

19:55.330 --> 19:58.170
Did you install
snow leopard for pc on this?

19:58.230 --> 19:59.770
- No way, let me see.
- This is good.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.540
Wow, look at all those tabs.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.100
Wait, are you printing
and watching a video?

20:03.170 --> 20:05.010
I don't know
what I'm doing right now.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.710
Um, so hey, um...

20:06.780 --> 20:08.280
Our collective bad.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.140
I could've sworn you had a gun.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.610
Nope, that's a pager.
You still got one of those.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.520
That's a common mistake.

20:18.190 --> 20:20.490
So...

20:20.560 --> 20:23.060
Do you guys like shrooms?

20:23.130 --> 20:24.560
Yes, please.
