WEBVTT

01:03.272 --> 01:05.566
- Good dog.
- Vogel!

01:05.649 --> 01:07.068
My little dove.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.820
Are we expecting guests?

01:09.904 --> 01:13.115
Indeed we are.
Even a famous poet.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.160
Wonderful.
What does he write?

01:18.162 --> 01:20.414
He has written
about a marquise

01:21.332 --> 01:25.044
who, while unconscious,
is impregnated by an unknown man

01:25.127 --> 01:27.421
and then discovers
that the unknown man

01:27.505 --> 01:30.674
is the man she thought
she was in love with.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.677
And consequently she
can no longer love him.

01:35.930 --> 01:40.518
That sounds rather strange.
Incidents of that kind rarely happen.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.272
Yet I find the fate of
the marquise moving.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.859
As if I were her.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.781
Well then, he must be
a truly outstanding poet,

01:53.864 --> 01:57.535
if his writings give you
such a curious idea!

02:19.431 --> 02:24.019
<i>A violet in the meadow stood</i>

02:24.103 --> 02:29.108
<i>With humble brow,
demure and good</i>

02:29.733 --> 02:34.905
<i>It was the sweetest violet</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:39.577
<i>There came along
a shepherdess</i>

02:39.660 --> 02:43.330
<i>With youthful step
and happiness</i>

02:43.414 --> 02:49.003
<i>Who sang
Who sang along the way</i>

02:49.086 --> 02:52.756
<i>This song</i>

03:00.764 --> 03:04.685
<i>Oh!
Thought the violet</i>

03:05.746 --> 03:11.422
<i>How I pine for nature's
beauty to be mine</i>

03:11.817 --> 03:16.822
<i>If only for a moment</i>

03:17.448 --> 03:21.035
<i>For then my love
might notice me</i>

03:21.118 --> 03:25.206
<i>And on her bosom fasten me</i>

03:25.289 --> 03:27.291
<i>Oh, I wish</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:33.135
<i>Oh, I wish if only
for a moment long</i>

03:36.675 --> 03:39.511
<i>But, cruel fate!</i>

03:39.595 --> 03:42.097
<i>The maiden came</i>

03:42.806 --> 03:46.060
<i>Without a glance
or care for it</i>

03:46.143 --> 03:50.940
<i>She trampled
down the violet</i>

03:51.899 --> 03:54.568
<i>It sank</i>

03:54.652 --> 03:57.738
<i>And died</i>

03:57.821 --> 04:02.368
<i>But happily</i>

04:02.451 --> 04:07.915
<i>And so I die then
let me die for her</i>

04:07.998 --> 04:09.750
<i>For her</i>

04:09.833 --> 04:15.256
<i>Beneath her darling feet</i>

04:19.510 --> 04:22.930
<i>Poor little violet</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:29.728
<i>It was the sweetest violet</i>

04:39.571 --> 04:41.532
Simply to die for!

04:53.043 --> 04:56.755
- She is an admirer of your marquise.
- Really?

04:56.839 --> 05:00.050
Oh, I wouldn't
call it admiration.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.388
Which woman has
experienced such a fate?

05:04.471 --> 05:07.808
That is what makes
the story so appealing.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.854
To read something one would
never wish to experience,

05:11.937 --> 05:15.232
and yet, bizarrely,
one yearns to imagine it all the same.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.361
I try to describe
what engenders fear,

05:19.987 --> 05:22.698
but perhaps also desire.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.616
Desire?

05:24.700 --> 05:27.703
I would say one has
to accept one's fate.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.664
- No matter how cruel it may be.
- But you said it yourself.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.500
The marquise is appealing.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.670
Yes.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.840
That may often be the case.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.801
You say one thing but
also feel another.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.889
Yes, this may often
be the case.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.225
You think you want to live,
but in fact you want to die.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.403
The poor thing.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.949
Who?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.951
Frau von Krahl.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.870
I feel sorry for her.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.332
Why is that?

06:14.375 --> 06:17.461
It must be terrible to be
such a famous singer,

06:18.003 --> 06:21.131
being exposed to the
opinion of the public.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.801
What if she made a mistake?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.470
It would be so embarrassing.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.308
But everybody admires her.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.687
Yes, but if she makes a mistake,
she will be despised.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.898
People can be so cruel.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.318
But she is famous,
respected.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.279
She has achieved a position.
All by herself.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.073
Nevertheless...

06:47.157 --> 06:50.911
I may have achieved nothing in life
except to take care of you and Pauline.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.957
But that's enough for me.
That's just the way I am.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.461
And how did you
find our poet?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.964
Oh, him.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.343
He seems to have a rather
melancholic disposition.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.430
He depresses me.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.307
But he appears to like you.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.435
Certainly not.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.816
My soul is in such
a precarious state

07:20.899 --> 07:23.777
that when I stick my
nose out of the window

07:23.861 --> 07:26.488
the daylight pains me with
its constant shimmering.

07:27.823 --> 07:31.160
Some people would consider
this an illness or excess tension.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.995
But not you.

07:33.078 --> 07:38.041
You have the ability to see the world
from a perspective other than your own.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.755
I have become so sensitive

07:43.839 --> 07:49.511
that even the smallest of onslaughts
to which my feelings are exposed

07:49.595 --> 07:52.055
causes me the
greatest of suffering.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.601
You are indeed melancholic today.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.272
Perhaps it is your gall that
troubles your soul? Or...

08:00.355 --> 08:03.358
My dearest friend,
it is not my gall,

08:03.442 --> 08:06.862
but the world itself
that troubles my soul.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.367
I know a doctor who understands
the soul thoroughly.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.705
He healed a woman who was blinded
by a shock and now she can see again.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.168
Nothing upon this
earth can help me.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.838
The present has no
appeal for me at all,

08:25.380 --> 08:30.135
and as for the future,
I can only think of the mortifying fact

08:30.219 --> 08:32.304
that it will end one day.

08:38.894 --> 08:44.608
However, what I long for is that you,
Marie, can understand me.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.403
But I do understand you,

08:48.487 --> 08:51.031
you dear and sensitive man.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.700
- Then may I ask something of you?
- Of course.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.788
Would you care
to die with me?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.584
Of course not.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.339
But with pistols it
can be very quick.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.050
First I'd shoot you,
and then myself.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.595
You would make me very,
very happy.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.641
I'm very fond of you,
as you know, my dear.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.310
But now you really
are going too far.

09:20.394 --> 09:24.898
- But I love you, Marie.
- And I love you too, my dear.

09:25.566 --> 09:29.152
Then please do consider my request,
my dearest Marie!

09:29.653 --> 09:31.738
Because I love you.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.826
And if you love me too, really love me,
you will do this for me.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.997
Because nothing in life should be
more important to you than this love.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.332
Not even life itself.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.999
<i>I'm afraid Pauline has
a piano lesson on Tuesday.</i>

11:06.083 --> 11:08.710
<i>I therefore cannot
go for a walk with you.</i>

11:12.756 --> 11:17.177
<i>On Wednesday Vogel has a free afternoon,
so we shall spend the time together.</i>

11:23.016 --> 11:26.061
<i>But if you are
available on Friday,</i>

11:26.144 --> 11:29.523
<i>I would be glad if you would
join us for a musical evening,</i>

11:29.606 --> 11:31.525
<i>at about seven o'clock.</i>

11:36.196 --> 11:38.532
<i>Whatever you wanted
to tell me face to face</i>

11:38.615 --> 11:41.785
<i>can surely be revealed in
the company of others after all.</i>

11:47.624 --> 11:50.502
Tell me, my dear friend,
for surely you know.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.755
It would interest me:
The new tax...

11:55.424 --> 11:57.968
Must absolutely
everybody pay it?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.095
Yes.

12:00.804 --> 12:04.099
- Including the aristocracy?
- Yes.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.060
But also the townsman,
the peasant and the beggar.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.981
The new tax applies to everybody.
That's what's new about it.

12:11.982 --> 12:17.028
And that is why the peasant is to be freed?
Merely so he can pay taxes?

12:17.112 --> 12:20.615
- How unjust.
- But still, it is a rather nice idea.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.618
Freedom and equality
for all before the law.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.455
That is French, is it not?

12:28.123 --> 12:31.293
I believe the peasants would
rather remain in bondage

12:31.376 --> 12:35.338
than be free like their masters
just so they can pay taxes.

12:35.422 --> 12:39.009
That is an undesirable freedom,
which nobody would want.

12:39.092 --> 12:44.264
- They would have to be freed by force.
- Exactly.

12:44.347 --> 12:49.186
How should a serf, who knows nothing
but bondage, survive on his own!

12:49.269 --> 12:51.271
It will be his downfall.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.273
And yet...

12:53.732 --> 12:57.736
I would rather be free and face my
downfall than remain in bondage.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.113
I would not.

13:00.197 --> 13:04.826
I am my husband's property, and I
should never dare to demand freedom.

13:09.372 --> 13:14.294
Our government's attempt to reform
the state according to French ideas

13:14.377 --> 13:17.714
is a mockery of our understanding
of justice and injustice.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.509
What they call equality
is really injustice,

13:20.592 --> 13:23.428
and what they call
freedom is a trick.

13:24.304 --> 13:28.183
Whereas the feudal state has
developed in Prussia over centuries

13:28.266 --> 13:32.103
and represents
the natural order.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.149
Why should we abandon it?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.904
In exchange for the shortsighted
ideas of some dreamers,

13:40.987 --> 13:44.616
who claim to be Republicans
or even Democrats?

13:44.699 --> 13:48.829
Dreamers who have apparently not
noticed that the revolt in France failed!

14:08.056 --> 14:12.686
<i>A violet in the meadow stood</i>

14:12.769 --> 14:17.983
<i>With humble brow,
demure and good</i>

14:18.066 --> 14:22.821
<i>It was the sweetest violet</i>

14:22.904 --> 14:26.616
<i>There came along
a shepherdess</i>

14:26.700 --> 14:30.704
<i>With youthful step
and happiness</i>

14:30.787 --> 14:35.750
<i>Who sang
Who sang along the way</i>

14:35.834 --> 14:38.503
<i>This song</i>

14:47.596 --> 14:51.933
<i>Oh! thought the violet</i>

14:52.828 --> 14:58.044
<i>How I pine for nature's
beauty to be mine</i>

14:58.815 --> 15:04.279
<i>Oh, if only for a moment</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:08.742
<i>For then my love
might notice me</i>

15:08.825 --> 15:13.288
<i>And on her bosom
fasten me</i>

15:13.747 --> 15:16.124
<i>I wish</i>

15:16.207 --> 15:22.066
<i>I wish if only for
a moment long</i>

15:26.051 --> 15:29.638
<i>But, cruel fate!</i>

15:29.721 --> 15:32.349
<i>The maiden came</i>

15:33.308 --> 15:37.896
<i>Without a glance
or care for it</i>

15:37.979 --> 15:43.318
<i>She trampled
down the violet</i>

15:44.653 --> 15:50.075
<i>It sank and died</i>

15:50.158 --> 15:53.995
<i>But happily</i>

15:54.996 --> 15:57.290
<i>And so I die</i>

15:57.374 --> 16:01.628
<i>Then let me die for her</i>

16:01.711 --> 16:03.880
<i>For her</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:08.760
<i>Beneath her darling feet</i>

16:12.055 --> 16:14.891
<i>Poor little violet</i>

16:16.017 --> 16:20.814
<i>It was the sweetest violet</i>

16:27.654 --> 16:30.490
Thank you, thank you.
Oh, please...

16:31.491 --> 16:33.618
Of course,
I am no Frau von Krahl.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.996
I'm just...

16:36.079 --> 16:37.455
Bravo.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.867
First... I do not wish to
keep this secret from you.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.828
I love another.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.080
You know her, I believe.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.626
A lady of high society
and of noble education.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.088
However,

17:27.172 --> 17:30.216
this love has not
been reciprocated.

17:31.384 --> 17:35.722
What can be worse than being rejected?
It makes me feel lonelier than ever.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.602
When love is not reciprocated,
love dies.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.899
I'm searching for an individual
who does return my love

17:46.566 --> 17:50.570
and will share with me
the wish I hold so dear.

17:52.655 --> 17:56.534
However, that particular lady has
refused to comply with this wish of mine.

17:56.618 --> 18:00.538
- And so I no longer love her.
- You speak of marriage?

18:01.289 --> 18:02.916
Not exactly.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.460
It is in fact something else.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.381
And now it appears to me that
you may be more right for this.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.760
I'm falling in love with you.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.681
Unless you are not...

18:20.350 --> 18:23.478
It may sound odd, but I am
not looking for a partner in life.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.231
But rather in death.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.109
Are you ill?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.611
One might say that.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.824
My soul is ill with
weariness and solitude.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.120
It's the fault of my
foolish disposition,

18:40.203 --> 18:42.872
that can only enjoy
what cannot be.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.668
I'm no good at life,

18:46.751 --> 18:49.712
but I don't want to die alone,
without love.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.051
So I seek the joy of
finding a kindred soul

18:55.135 --> 18:57.679
who understands my suffering

18:57.762 --> 18:59.681
and is like me,

18:59.764 --> 19:01.975
so that we can die together.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.188
And you thought of me?

19:08.314 --> 19:11.317
- But why?
- Forgive me if I'm too direct.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.405
But you seem to be

19:16.447 --> 19:18.950
an outsider just like me.

19:20.285 --> 19:23.329
You are also lonely.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.792
Bereft of friends.
And nothing really matters to you.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.378
You love nothing,

19:31.379 --> 19:33.882
and nobody loves you.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.552
What?
How can you say that?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.263
I have my child

19:40.930 --> 19:43.808
and my husband,
who loves me very much indeed.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.562
- But do you love him?
- Yes.

19:48.563 --> 19:51.024
And my little Pauline
loves me too,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.859
and I love her.

19:54.319 --> 19:57.322
Well, perhaps I was mistaken.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.908
Forgive me.

20:29.854 --> 20:33.483
Oh, Vogel.
I am so happy to see you.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.278
How was your journey?

20:38.404 --> 20:42.242
It confirmed what I keep
trying to tell the chancellor.

20:43.284 --> 20:48.331
Many people are still not registered
in a trade, so they can't be taxed.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.761
I am only responsible
for taxing the trades.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.764
How can I demand payment
of the general tax

21:04.847 --> 21:07.183
when not everyone
is registered yet?

21:11.437 --> 21:16.442
And I doubt that the registered trades
will bear the burden in the meantime.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.029
Mama?

22:01.404 --> 22:03.906
Please tell me what
you really think.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.037
What sort of infection is this?
If it really is one.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.749
If I knew, I would tell you.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.846
Amazing how suddenly
everything can change.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.142
Only yesterday I was...

22:33.269 --> 22:34.854
happy

22:35.271 --> 22:36.939
and carefree.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.942
And now this.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.488
Ah, it will pass.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.620
But do you not
worry about me?

22:51.954 --> 22:55.792
If Pauline were ill,
I would be beside myself with worry.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.044
That would not help her much.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.017
Henriette.

23:13.768 --> 23:16.562
- How lovely to see you.
- Yes.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.232
How are you?

23:19.899 --> 23:24.654
Madame Vogel is still weak
because of these ailments.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.907
You must not tire her,
my friend.

23:27.990 --> 23:31.285
- Oh, really? What is wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.580
Or at least,
they say it is nothing.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.834
But perhaps they just
don't know what it is.

23:38.459 --> 23:42.505
It is upsetting to have an illness
nobody knows or understands.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.426
I also suffer

23:46.509 --> 23:51.055
from something internal, invisible,
which nobody knows or understands.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.350
How similar we are.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.327
"And when the count,
during a happy hour,

24:13.411 --> 24:18.749
asked his wife why, despite seeming
capable of withstanding all depravity,

24:18.833 --> 24:21.961
she had fled from him
as if he were the devil,

24:22.044 --> 24:25.256
she replied, throwing her
arms around his neck,

24:26.048 --> 24:29.093
that he would never have
seemed like the devil to her

24:29.177 --> 24:34.182
if he had not seemed like an angel
upon his first appearance. "

24:41.105 --> 24:43.858
- How well-worded.
- You are smart.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.694
But now I ask you:

24:46.777 --> 24:51.866
When the count slept with the woman
he loved without her agreement,

24:52.742 --> 24:55.870
was he acting
justly or unjustly?

24:58.414 --> 25:01.292
- Unjustly.
- Precisely.

25:02.251 --> 25:06.422
Then why are you plaguing yourself
and us with the absurd suggestion

25:06.506 --> 25:09.091
that he could win the love
of the marquise in the end?

25:09.592 --> 25:11.761
What useless hypochondria.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.349
But, Mother, if the marquise
truly loves this man,

25:16.933 --> 25:20.520
- and her love is stronger than his crime.
- Nonsense.

25:21.562 --> 25:24.232
In that case the poor
woman is seriously ill

25:24.315 --> 25:27.568
and needs to be cured from
an unhealthy kind of love

25:27.652 --> 25:30.029
which is nothing more
than artificial exultation.

25:30.112 --> 25:33.074
I hope, my child,
that I have taught you otherwise.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.659
Mother...

25:38.955 --> 25:40.998
I really prefer Goethe.

26:19.579 --> 26:23.541
It's strange to have an
illness that may not be one.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.964
A figment of the imagination
which is as real as reality.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.511
So what's the difference?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.640
The main thing is,
it's nothing serious.

26:55.031 --> 26:59.201
Please, tell my wife all this.
I couldn't repeat your words.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.911
Believe me...

27:12.214 --> 27:16.385
It really is most interesting.

27:17.386 --> 27:21.724
It is extraordinary and rather
difficult for me to describe.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.769
Medicine is facing
a mystery here.

27:25.561 --> 27:29.482
The latest examination
of Madame Vogel's urine,

27:29.565 --> 27:33.778
which I was sure would help us

27:34.570 --> 27:38.574
and which, to be certain, I performed
myself together with a colleague,

27:39.158 --> 27:40.826
revealed nothing.

27:40.910 --> 27:44.455
Nothing to cause alarm
from a medical point of view.

27:45.039 --> 27:50.169
I shall have the results checked
by the medical board of the Charité.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.545
Then we can be certain.

27:51.629 --> 27:55.508
But what causes the spasms if
there's nothing wrong with me?

27:55.591 --> 27:59.345
We doctors are in
the dark about this.

27:59.428 --> 28:04.141
But perhaps this is
a female complaint

28:04.725 --> 28:07.144
of a more spiritual
than physical nature.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.647
This assumption is
based on the theory

28:09.730 --> 28:14.402
that a certain fluidum flows through
both the soul and the body,

28:14.485 --> 28:17.113
which therefore
influence each other.

28:17.196 --> 28:21.158
This would explain why
spiritual disturbances

28:21.242 --> 28:23.619
can lead to physical illnesses.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.288
Nonsense.

28:27.081 --> 28:30.126
Thank God,
it isn't serious at least.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.504
So Mama doesn't have to die?

28:38.092 --> 28:39.844
And what can be done?

28:47.309 --> 28:49.145
Relax.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.523
I can't.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.236
Something is depressing
and destroying my mood,

28:57.319 --> 28:59.655
making me anxious and sad.

29:03.534 --> 29:06.036
Would you like to
tell us something?

29:07.788 --> 29:09.498
I'm afraid.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.169
There's nothing to be afraid of.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.173
It's the flowers.
They frighten me.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.675
The flowers?

29:20.718 --> 29:22.261
Yes.

29:23.763 --> 29:27.433
I can't bear to see
their sweet beauty.

29:29.518 --> 29:33.606
It reminds me of the fact
that they will fade.

29:36.734 --> 29:40.279
Their bittersweet scent
lingers in my nose.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.033
- I see. The flowers.
- Yes.

29:45.576 --> 29:50.414
The flowers and other
quite banal things.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.710
They strike me as menacing,

29:57.630 --> 30:01.383
and an undefined fear
arises within me

30:03.219 --> 30:05.387
which causes me
to see the world

30:06.138 --> 30:10.726
and everything in it
with a terrible doubt:

30:13.938 --> 30:17.066
What if all this
was a mistake?

30:24.573 --> 30:26.575
I can't remember anything.

30:26.659 --> 30:29.787
That is quite normal.
Wouldn't you say?

30:31.288 --> 30:36.919
The patient can't remember anything
she says or does during the treatment

30:37.002 --> 30:40.256
due to a kind of
protective mechanism.

30:40.339 --> 30:45.177
In a magnetic sleep the
patient utters things

30:45.261 --> 30:48.180
that she would never
say in a waking state.

30:49.098 --> 30:50.933
What did I say?

30:52.768 --> 30:54.687
Nothing important, really.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.106
Wouldn't you say?

30:59.108 --> 31:01.610
This treatment requires
a number of sessions

31:01.694 --> 31:03.612
in order to achieve success.

31:04.989 --> 31:07.324
Is the treatment working, then?

31:09.118 --> 31:13.289
It often takes months or even
years until one finds something

31:13.372 --> 31:19.003
that might indicate the spiritual
origin of the current ailment.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.508
Here,
we are in the darkness.

31:52.161 --> 31:57.833
<i>Where the blue mountains</i>

31:57.917 --> 32:03.088
<i>Rise from the lowering skies</i>

32:03.172 --> 32:06.008
<i>Look inside</i>

32:09.637 --> 32:14.850
<i>Where the sun sets</i>

32:14.934 --> 32:20.356
<i>Where the clouds spread</i>

32:20.439 --> 32:23.567
<i>There I would like to be</i>

32:27.112 --> 32:30.199
<i>There I would like to be</i>

32:37.706 --> 32:43.253
<i>There in that quiet valley</i>

32:43.337 --> 32:48.592
<i>Which silences pain and woe</i>

32:48.676 --> 32:51.512
<i>"So I spend my evenings
with the Vogels,</i>

32:51.595 --> 32:55.683
<i>because this lady does not let me
see her alone, for the sake of decency.</i>

32:56.600 --> 33:00.354
<i>You see, my friend,
how limited she is by convention.</i>

33:00.437 --> 33:04.274
<i>But I intend to
free her from this,</i>

33:05.442 --> 33:07.403
<i>for her own good,</i>

33:07.486 --> 33:10.906
<i>since this narrow-minded
life is humiliating</i>

33:10.990 --> 33:15.411
<i>and deprives one of all possibility
of doing what one's soul wishes.</i>

33:17.037 --> 33:21.083
<i>It produces people who
do not know themselves</i>

33:21.166 --> 33:25.462
<i>and behave like puppets,
moving to a fixed choreography.</i>

33:28.090 --> 33:32.845
<i>So, in short, when I observe
this idyllic scene</i>

33:33.595 --> 33:36.098
<i>and pretend that
I am part of it,</i>

33:36.181 --> 33:38.517
<i>I am thrilled by
the wonderful idea</i>

33:38.600 --> 33:42.980
<i>that Henriette would give
up all this worldly happiness</i>

33:43.063 --> 33:46.025
<i>for my sake.</i>

33:46.775 --> 33:50.738
<i>That she would sacrifice
it all at my feet.</i>

33:51.405 --> 33:54.116
<i>How divine that would be. "</i>

33:54.783 --> 33:57.745
<i>Eternally</i>

34:02.166 --> 34:05.878
<i>Eternally</i>

34:32.237 --> 34:33.989
Bon appétit.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.574
I think I had better
wait in the salon.

35:04.978 --> 35:10.692
After examining the findings
on Madame Vogel,

35:10.776 --> 35:14.196
the medical board
of the Charité in Berlin

35:14.571 --> 35:16.824
has come to a
different conclusion

35:16.907 --> 35:20.369
regarding the manner
and extent of her illness.

35:21.870 --> 35:26.625
The Charité sent me this letter,
which I will read to you now.

35:28.585 --> 35:32.381
"The examination
of Madame Vogel

35:32.464 --> 35:36.802
by the medical board
of Charité in Berlin,

35:36.885 --> 35:42.599
performed on the 7th of May 1811,
gave the following conclusion.

35:43.892 --> 35:49.314
The patient is suffering from
an incurable ulcer or tumor

35:49.398 --> 35:52.484
in the lower abdomen,
with discharge.

35:53.777 --> 35:59.199
The ulcer or tumor is approximately
two inches in diameter,

35:59.283 --> 36:02.870
about the size of an unripe
green apple or an orange.

36:04.329 --> 36:08.417
Considering the type of ulcer or tumor,
this means it is in an advanced stage.

36:09.979 --> 36:12.928
It appears to have
been present in

36:13.061 --> 36:16.576
the patient's abdomen
for some time,

36:16.611 --> 36:18.704
approximately two years.

36:18.760 --> 36:24.016
It also appears that
this ulcer or tumor

36:24.099 --> 36:29.688
has caused the faintings and spasms
that the patient has suffered.

36:31.773 --> 36:36.069
The patient should be treated according
to the advice of the family doctor,

36:36.153 --> 36:39.948
since we do not advise
any special treatment.

36:41.533 --> 36:46.038
With best regards, Dr. Kienast, Prussian
Medical Board of the Charité, Berlin. "

36:49.333 --> 36:51.793
So it is serious after all.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.423
So Mama does have to die?

36:56.965 --> 36:59.259
Everyone has to die sometime.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.473
And what can be done?

37:07.309 --> 37:10.854
Bed rest and bloodletting.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.567
Two cups of chamomile
tea a day.

37:15.651 --> 37:20.572
Avoid all local irritation.
This also includes intercourse.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.076
The condition is not contagious,

37:24.159 --> 37:27.329
but you need rest,

37:28.664 --> 37:30.540
and plenty of fresh air.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.226
I'm afraid she doesn't
have much time left.

39:03.008 --> 39:06.762
- Imagine: I'm going to die.
- Oh.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.765
It is that serious?

39:10.599 --> 39:12.642
I heard the doctor tell Vogel.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.604
I don't have long to live.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.693
I am ashamed that I
understand you only now.

39:21.777 --> 39:24.029
Now that I am facing
death myself.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.659
But now I prefer
to die with you

39:30.994 --> 39:34.915
than be killed by this terrible illness,
alone in a sick bed.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.504
I didn't think I was
so close to death.

39:41.505 --> 39:44.466
I was in the prime of my life,
and now this.

39:45.384 --> 39:48.136
So you were right
to choose me after all.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.100
- I no longer expected this.
- Neither did I.

39:54.518 --> 39:58.063
- This is rather a surprise for me now.
- For me, too.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.069
Allow me to think about it.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.114
Do stay!

40:20.669 --> 40:22.838
It is good not to be alone,

40:24.172 --> 40:26.091
to speak with somebody

40:27.342 --> 40:29.469
who knows me better
than I know myself.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.681
And who is also
so close to death.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.934
I'm not really sure.

40:36.017 --> 40:40.021
You said things about me
that I had never dared to think,

40:40.105 --> 40:44.317
and now I feel that everything
you said may be true.

40:45.527 --> 40:48.071
You spoke about
my loneliness

40:48.655 --> 40:51.533
and said I did not love
and was not loved.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.120
It's as if I can see clearly now.

40:57.581 --> 41:00.584
I see that my existence
is meaningless,

41:01.710 --> 41:03.753
something which
you saw already.

41:05.839 --> 41:08.425
You say these things
because you are ill.

41:08.508 --> 41:12.053
What of it?
Now I understand you, Heinrich.

41:12.554 --> 41:14.639
Like you understood me.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.434
Because I now feel
as lonely as you.

41:18.727 --> 41:22.731
I have become the woman
you saw in me earlier.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.068
I am yours now.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.240
Suddenly I am not so sure.

41:34.284 --> 41:35.911
Forgive me, Henriette,

41:36.912 --> 41:40.790
I had hoped you would decide
to take this step for my sake.

41:41.374 --> 41:45.170
Because you accept my sorrow
as your own and love me for it.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.756
And not because of
your fear of death.

41:48.757 --> 41:52.093
You see, I suffer not from death,
but from life.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.876
Is Fräulein Marie at home?

42:25.544 --> 42:27.546
The Fräulein is out of town.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.299
But Frau von Massow
is at home.

42:40.475 --> 42:44.020
You are acquainted with this
Adam Müller, are you not?

42:44.729 --> 42:48.775
He told us recently that the
reform has been decided upon.

42:49.651 --> 42:53.238
What do you say to that?
Isn't it awful?

42:53.905 --> 42:56.908
Even we must pay taxes now.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.829
It is utterly inconvenient for me.

43:01.663 --> 43:05.208
I shall have to dismiss my valet,
the poor man.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.379
- Was that the aim of it?
- My dear aunt.

43:09.462 --> 43:13.466
I have lost my allowance
from the queen,

43:13.550 --> 43:16.636
which I received until
her untimely death.

43:16.720 --> 43:21.266
Even my sister is losing faith in my
talent and has withdrawn my funds.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.518
So what do I care
for your valet?

43:23.602 --> 43:27.397
Then you must find yourself
a sensible position.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.025
Or at least join the
volunteer corps.

43:30.692 --> 43:32.611
Make yourself useful,

43:33.403 --> 43:37.073
and protect us from
these new French ideas,

43:37.157 --> 43:40.410
which lead to slaughter,
as we've witnessed.

43:40.493 --> 43:43.872
The people cannot be left
to rule over themselves.

43:44.748 --> 43:48.543
Even Queen Luise dressed
in the Parisian fashion.

43:49.586 --> 43:53.757
Oh, and Marie,
your dear cousin,

43:53.840 --> 43:57.802
is marrying a Frenchman.
Just imagine.

43:57.886 --> 44:01.348
- What?
- Yes, she is engaged.

44:01.431 --> 44:03.558
- In Paris?
- Exactly.

44:03.642 --> 44:05.560
- To a Frenchman?
- Yes.

44:10.899 --> 44:13.568
Why isn't anything
going right for me?

44:16.321 --> 44:18.531
Are you expecting
her to return soon?

44:18.615 --> 44:22.160
My dear friend, do not raise
your hopes about that.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.162
It's too late.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.332
- One never knows.
- In this case, one does.

44:37.133 --> 44:41.137
- The chancellor enforced the
new laws. - What a pity.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.807
What will you do?

44:46.434 --> 44:52.190
I shall do my best to deal with the
problems threatening the reforms

44:52.273 --> 44:54.693
and ensure they
can be effective.

44:54.776 --> 44:58.863
These reforms may fail
due to the lack of a system

44:58.947 --> 45:04.160
for measuring income and property
as the basis for taxation.

45:04.244 --> 45:05.870
We have too few officials.

45:05.954 --> 45:10.333
And the nobility cling to their
privileges like a dog to his bone.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.586
That may be.

45:16.715 --> 45:20.051
My dear Vogel,
I shall go to the country tomorrow.

45:20.135 --> 45:22.303
How lovely.
It will do you good.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.183
I shall stay overnight.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.311
Yes, do enjoy yourself.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.025
I will not be alone.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.405
I see...

45:51.750 --> 45:54.002
Do you like this cup?

45:58.715 --> 46:00.884
It is quite valuable.

46:00.967 --> 46:03.678
It would fetch a good price.

46:05.221 --> 46:07.348
I don't know about such things.

46:09.184 --> 46:10.685
Well...

46:11.352 --> 46:13.688
There is no need to sell it.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.900
You can simply enjoy
its fine appearance.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.196
Yes, ma'am.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.594
<i>For the love and kindness,</i>

46:45.386 --> 46:50.350
<i>you, my dear, have shown me
in the 72 years of our marriage,</i>

46:51.142 --> 46:53.686
<i>I cannot thank you enough.</i>

46:57.607 --> 47:00.985
<i>I beg of you from
the bottom of my heart,</i>

47:01.069 --> 47:04.405
<i>to forgive me if I
have ever offended you.</i>

47:04.489 --> 47:08.034
<i>We shall meet
again in a place</i>

47:08.117 --> 47:10.578
<i>where all shall be forgiven.</i>

48:11.890 --> 48:14.434
But the doctor said
you should rest.

48:32.327 --> 48:35.204
Be a good girl and always
obey your father.

48:36.372 --> 48:37.874
Yes.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.836
You'll see, soon you
will be a grown-up,

48:42.211 --> 48:44.130
and have your place in life.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.174
Yes.

48:46.674 --> 48:48.843
And you will be
content with it.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.137
Yes.

50:04.419 --> 50:06.754
How long do you
intend to stay?

50:09.465 --> 50:12.427
- Until tomorrow.
- One night, then.

50:21.561 --> 50:25.314
Oh, Heinrich, I'm so happy
that we found one another.

50:29.110 --> 50:31.529
It happens more often
than one might think,

50:31.612 --> 50:35.033
that two people who are
destined for one another

50:35.116 --> 50:37.368
simply do not find
each other.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.622
Yes, that does happen.

50:57.013 --> 51:01.267
What a fine thing it is that now
we can experience how it feels

51:01.350 --> 51:03.269
to truly love.

51:05.688 --> 51:07.690
Yes, it is a fine thing.

51:19.452 --> 51:21.412
Why two?

51:21.496 --> 51:24.415
- In case one doesn't work.
- I see.

51:39.847 --> 51:41.682
"My dear Marie...

51:48.773 --> 51:51.317
...might surprise you.

51:51.400 --> 51:54.153
I have replaced you
with another friend.

51:54.237 --> 51:58.866
But not one who wants to live with me.
Rather, one who wants to die with me.

52:01.869 --> 52:06.040
A friend whose soul floats...

52:11.254 --> 52:13.005
Whose soul...

52:14.215 --> 52:18.928
flies like a young

52:19.011 --> 52:20.721
eagle,

52:21.389 --> 52:24.475
like I have never seen before.

52:25.351 --> 52:30.606
She understands that my
sadness is deep and incurable,

52:30.690 --> 52:33.401
and therefore wants
to die with me. "

52:41.450 --> 52:43.035
Yes?

52:45.037 --> 52:46.914
Oh, excuse me.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.377
You may come in.

52:53.379 --> 52:55.423
There is a problem.

52:56.174 --> 52:59.051
- What is it?
- We are not alone.

52:59.802 --> 53:02.805
Adam Müller is here.
He is sitting downstairs.

53:03.431 --> 53:05.600
I think he recognized me.

53:12.607 --> 53:15.693
Madame Vogel has been kind
enough to read my poetry,

53:15.776 --> 53:18.529
which assists me
greatly in my work.

53:19.614 --> 53:23.326
Don't worry, my friend.
I shall be as silent as a grave.

53:24.452 --> 53:28.080
You completely misunderstand,
my dear friend.

53:28.164 --> 53:32.335
Heinrich, don't be such a moralist.
You are offending the lady.

53:33.794 --> 53:37.798
This lady is here to read my
poetry and for no other purpose.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.302
At least,
not the purpose you imagine.

53:42.094 --> 53:44.472
No offense.
As you wish.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.395
I had no idea the lady
was such a gifted reader.

53:55.650 --> 53:58.486
And the tragedy?
How was it received?

54:00.154 --> 54:03.491
With a lot of bellyache and
some well-meant criticism, I hear.

54:10.665 --> 54:14.168
That's enough.
I have had enough of your insults.

54:25.680 --> 54:30.017
I had better leave you to your
business and say good night.

54:31.018 --> 54:32.687
It is late.

54:33.854 --> 54:36.691
No, I shall leave.
You stay.

54:37.566 --> 54:38.818
I wanted to go anyway.

54:38.901 --> 54:40.903
- Please stay.
- Too late.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.614
I can't stay any longer.

55:28.743 --> 55:33.998
<i>Where the blue mountains</i>

55:35.249 --> 55:40.129
<i>Rise from the lowering skies</i>

55:40.671 --> 55:43.591
<i>Look inside</i>

55:47.219 --> 55:52.641
<i>Where the sun sets</i>

55:53.351 --> 55:59.065
<i>Where the clouds spread</i>

55:59.148 --> 56:02.151
<i>There I would like to be</i>

56:06.447 --> 56:09.784
<i>There I would like to be</i>

56:15.915 --> 56:21.170
<i>There in that
quiet valley</i>

56:21.796 --> 56:27.134
<i>Which silences
pain and woe</i>

56:27.635 --> 56:30.388
<i>Where in rocky spaces</i>

56:30.471 --> 56:35.601
<i>Softly sleep the primroses</i>

56:36.018 --> 56:39.605
<i>And sweeps so gently</i>

56:45.945 --> 56:49.031
Will we go to Freienwalde
again next summer?

56:49.824 --> 56:51.325
Perhaps.

56:52.284 --> 56:55.371
And will we visit the
Poggenpohl's bunnies then?

56:59.333 --> 57:01.001
Certainly.

57:13.681 --> 57:16.851
For improvements to the
servants' quarters: 50 thalers.

57:17.601 --> 57:21.939
For warm clothes, shoes
and hair-bands for the child: 11 thalers.

57:22.022 --> 57:25.734
And finally,
for daily expenses: 24 thalers.

57:30.030 --> 57:32.700
Very good.
You were thrifty.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.412
We are left with
15 Reichsthalers.

57:37.455 --> 57:40.583
Use the money for yourself.
Buy something nice.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.085
Thank you.

57:44.879 --> 57:47.923
Do you intend to go
on excursions again?

57:51.760 --> 57:53.220
No.

57:54.722 --> 57:57.141
It would certainly
do you good.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.435
- You know...
- I know.

58:07.193 --> 58:08.736
Marie?

58:09.361 --> 58:10.779
Oh!

58:11.906 --> 58:13.908
You are back in town?

58:14.617 --> 58:18.996
I asked your aunt to tell me as
soon as you returned to Berlin.

58:19.079 --> 58:22.500
I returned earlier to take
care of some matters.

58:22.583 --> 58:25.044
Do come to tea one day.
My aunt will be delighted.

58:25.127 --> 58:27.922
Perhaps now?
If that is convenient?

58:29.423 --> 58:30.925
Of course.

58:40.935 --> 58:44.480
What matters do you need
to take care of here in Berlin?

58:46.649 --> 58:48.943
I believe my aunt has told you.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.321
I am to be married.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.032
I heard,

58:55.115 --> 58:57.117
but I didn't want to believe it.

58:58.285 --> 59:01.622
Do you have no feelings
for me whatsoever?

59:02.790 --> 59:05.084
On the contrary, my friend.

59:05.167 --> 59:08.546
The friendship I feel for you will
not end because of my marriage.

59:08.629 --> 59:10.464
Perhaps not because
of your marriage,

59:11.090 --> 59:13.592
but because I decided
to end myself.

59:13.676 --> 59:15.844
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

59:15.928 --> 59:17.346
Marie,

59:17.930 --> 59:21.058
do you remember our
conversation in the salon?

59:21.141 --> 59:24.228
- When I made a certain
request of you? - Yes.

59:25.020 --> 59:29.191
Well, I had hoped that you might
have changed your mind.

59:30.484 --> 59:33.070
As a result of
your experiences

59:33.153 --> 59:35.781
or the letters we exchanged.

59:35.864 --> 59:39.910
Yes, your letters. I meant to reply,
but so many things came up.

59:39.994 --> 59:42.288
- I'm sure you know what I mean.
- I'm afraid not.

59:42.997 --> 59:45.165
In my case,
nothing ever comes up.

59:49.003 --> 59:52.548
I myself arrange everything
I need for my daily work.

59:54.341 --> 59:57.886
Nobody offers me anything.
But I'm not complaining.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.099
Marie,

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.476
I ask you:

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.520
Do you want to die with me?

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:09.106
- No.
- But Marie!

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:14.862
Dying with you would be a happy end
to my constant suffering on this earth.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:19.617
With you at my side it would
be so easy to say farewell.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.912
Certain of your love I would prefer
the grave to the bed of any queen.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:27.666
I am not the person
you think I am.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.127
But how could I be so wrong?

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:34.006
How could I dare ask again,
despite your refusal,

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:38.427
if I were not certain that a kindred
heart beats in your breast?

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.222
That kindred thoughts
fill your mind,

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:45.559
that your soul is the
sister of my own?

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:48.520
In short, if I did not know

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:52.232
that you can understand my
disappointment with the world?

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.777
Because you also

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:59.365
see the emptiness
of all worldly efforts.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:03.327
Oh, why do you let
yourself go like this?

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.999
I always enjoyed
philosophizing with you,

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.794
but you are starting
to spoil my good mood.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:16.340
I agree that life is meaningless
and people are cruel,

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:19.760
but there's no need to
let it bother you so much.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:23.847
You have to make an effort,

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:29.353
use a bit of imagination and good will
to see the pleasant side of things.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.653
- So you do not love me?
- Not in the way you imagine.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.786
You and your romantic ideas.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:49.415
In the end everybody
has to die alone.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:52.459
- Not even you can change that.
- Yes, I can.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.129
We shall see.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:04.304
<i>"Henriette,</i>

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:10.561
<i>my wish to die
together with you,</i>

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:14.982
<i>in the hope that you can love
me and that I may love you,</i>

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.985
<i>is stronger than ever.</i>

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.655
<i>Forgive me my long silence.</i>

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.324
<i>Is it too late?</i>

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.369
<i>Or may I still hope?</i>

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:33.500
<i>Are you really the person
I have always believed you to be?</i>

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.589
<i>Give me a sign</i>

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.967
<i>to answer my
tormenting questions. "</i>

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.982
How have you been?

01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:01.403
I had not heard from you and
assumed you had forgotten about me.

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:04.656
Never, Henriette,
could I ever forget you.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.452
I think of you constantly.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.468
It is the same for me.

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:29.389
At least every second thought
that passes through my mind

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.391
is addressed to you,

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.394
my dear.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.150
I was a fool.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.278
Blinded, selfish,

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.948
full of mistrust.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:49.993
I could not believe
that I could be so lucky

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:52.746
to find the one who would
prefer death at my side

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.582
to life at the
side of another

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:58.418
out of love.

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:16.186
So then it is settled?

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.730
We shall become
immortal together?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.320
First I will shoot you
and then myself.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.107
Henriette?

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.457
I have interesting
news from Paris.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.042
Yes?

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:25.505
I met a doctor there who specializes
in illnesses of the spirit,

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:29.343
similar to Mesmer,
who is well known here in Berlin.

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:32.471
I gave him your records

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.264
and imagine,

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:39.478
he thought that your condition
may be a nervous disorder after all.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:42.356
He considers it a
very interesting case.

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:45.609
He would like to
examine you in person.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.861
Really?

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.740
Oh, Paris.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.701
That would be a lovely trip.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:59.706
They are very advanced in
such things there, aren't they?

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.541
Yes.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.710
Much more so than here,

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:07.965
especially when illnesses
of the spirit are concerned,

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.841
I have been told.

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:13.762
But I have a real tumor,
not an imaginary one.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:18.976
The two are connected,
the imaginary and the real.

01:06:23.522 --> 01:06:25.399
But the political situation.

01:06:26.108 --> 01:06:30.278
Going to Paris would
not be safe now, surely?

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.032
The journey was quite
dangerous, I admit.

01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:37.285
You see?
Oh, we should forget about it.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:40.122
No.
There is still hope.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.624
Henriette,
we must try everything.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.294
Oh.

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.755
I'm scared.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.759
What if there is no cure,

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:55.762
and the hope was in vain?

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:05.105
Henriette,

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:08.275
you have always
been loyal to me.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.070
Now it's my turn

01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:14.448
to be loyal to you.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:19.786
I will try everything
to keep you.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.072
They are ringing the knells.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:00.243
In memory of Queen Luise.

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:03.830
Oh no, you are mistaken.
Those are the bells of life.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:08.335
Ringing for her redeemed
soul which is immortal.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.145
Take your places
for the waltz.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.855
It is bizarre.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:20.568
I feel as if an outside power
was controlling me.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.823
As if I were a puppet
in a puppet theater.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:29.995
Or as if I was hypnotized
by a hypnotist,

01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.580
and I cannot awake
from the trance.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:38.169
And at the same time,
I realize there is no awakening.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:43.174
There is no other life
than this one.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.886
You can't choose.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.888
Isn't that right, Vogel?

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:54.060
No, my dear. I do believe
some things can be chosen.

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:58.982
But love!
That can't be chosen.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.820
In a way it can.

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:08.241
For example, you can choose to
live with me or with someone else.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.410
With that poet, for example.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.081
No, I couldn't live with him.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.543
He only thinks of himself.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:26.801
But if you really
did prefer him,

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:31.431
I want you to know that I
would respect your choice.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:40.940
It would be hard for Pauline at first,
but children adapt fast.

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.391
It has got so cold,

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.435
and I don't feel well.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.481
Shouldn't we postpone
the excursion?

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:28.279
But, my little dove,
an excursion would do you good.

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:31.324
It's exactly what you
need in your condition.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:37.080
Imagine, we will be going
out of town soon. To Paris.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.668
- Oh.
- Yes.

01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:45.839
Vogel found a doctor
who knows a treatment

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.341
for the ulcer.

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:51.302
Or for the fainting
fits at least.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.889
He may be able to cure me.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.891
I see.

01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:59.185
Yes, there is hope,

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:02.689
although the situation
does seem to be serious.

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:09.028
What do you carry
in that case?

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:11.531
Pistols?

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.491
No.

01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.703
I catch butterflies.

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:21.666
I need all sorts of equipment for that,
which I keep in this case.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.295
Butterflies?

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.547
- In November?
- Yes.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.442
Excuse me...

01:16:57.405 --> 01:17:02.035
"My little dove, my life,
the light of my life,

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.705
my all,
my every possession,

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:11.210
my castles and fields,
my meadows and vineyards.

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:15.214
Oh, sun, moon and stars,

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:19.427
heaven and earth,
past and future,

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:22.180
my bride,

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:27.101
my dearest friend, my heart's blood,
my bowels, light of my eyes!

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:33.983
My dearest,
what should I call you?

01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:36.235
My golden child, my pearl,

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.571
my precious stone,
my crown,

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:42.575
my queen and empress.
My highest and dearest... "

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:20.639
The bodies will be taken
to the morgue later today.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:27.188
The deceased left no
letters or messages,

01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:31.150
as far as we can tell.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.763
Have you forgotten Silesia?

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:48.811
The illiterate peasants were
made dizzy and brought to believe

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:51.147
that since they
are paying taxes

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:55.359
they are absolutely free to
do whatever they please.

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:57.528
- There were even fatalities.
- Yes.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:01.073
Mankind is neither
equal nor free by nature.

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:05.369
Each one of us is bound
to what he happens to be.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:09.832
And a state is much
closer to this truth

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:12.668
by not making every man
responsible for himself.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:17.756
But rather by helping the ignorant
by appointing to power

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.554
those who have studied, analyzed
and thought everything through,

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:28.559
only to find out how difficult it
still is to make the right decisions.

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:33.022
Unfortunately Prussia
will soon be bankrupt,

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.691
so it will have to
make some changes

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:40.404
and introduce a more economical use
of land, livestock and manpower.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.992
And this will mean
more freedom, of course.

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:48.120
More than we all
seem to want.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:54.126
In England free trade among free citizens
brought wealth and prosperity.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:56.879
Social reforms are good.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:27:00.257
But if they mean equality
of all subjects,

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:03.469
remember the Jacobite terror,

01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:06.138
they must be condemned.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:15.022
If only we were spared
the democracy

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:19.652
where educated people
will be outvoted by the mob.

01:27:35.376 --> 01:27:38.837
Let's hear it.
We have no secrets here.

01:27:45.511 --> 01:27:48.472
The autopsy has revealed

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:52.851
that all of Madame Vogel's
internal organs were in good health.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:55.729
No tumor or ulcer was found.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:01.360
So it would seem it really
was a nervous disorder.

01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:06.365
It was a mistake after all.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:18.002
It was out of love after all.

01:28:46.322 --> 01:28:51.990
<i>Where the blue mountains</i>

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.751
<i>Rise from the lowering skies</i>

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:02.921
<i>Look inside</i>

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:13.651
<i>Where the sun sets</i>

01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:19.938
<i>Where the clouds spread</i>

01:29:20.773 --> 01:29:23.776
<i>There I would like to be</i>

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:31.784
<i>There I would like to be</i>

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:46.006
<i>There in that quiet valley</i>

01:29:46.799 --> 01:29:52.388
<i>Which silences pain and woe</i>

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:56.058
<i>Where in rocky spaces</i>

01:29:56.141 --> 01:30:01.842
<i>Softly sleep the primroses</i>

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:08.487
<i>And sweeps so
gently the wind</i>

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:12.157
<i>There I would like to be</i>

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:20.207
<i>There I would like to be</i>

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:35.161
<i>To the forests depths</i>

01:30:36.515 --> 01:30:42.229
<i>Pushes me the
power of my love</i>

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.899
<i>My inner pain</i>

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.528
<i>My inner pain</i>

01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:01.123
<i>If only I could stay</i>

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:07.796
<i>If only I could
be with you</i>

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.717
<i>Eternally</i>

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:20.392
<i>Eternally</i>
