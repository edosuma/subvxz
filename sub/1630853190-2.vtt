WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:06.040
Waffles in Warrior Pose.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.476
Both empowering...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.811
and delicious.

00:10.911 --> 00:13.447
What kind of millennial hell
is this?

00:13.547 --> 00:14.815
"Random Eating."

00:14.915 --> 00:16.584
We used to have this bit
called "Random Dancing,"

00:16.684 --> 00:18.452
but this is way more grown-up.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.388
Next, we have...

00:24.258 --> 00:27.328
"Lasagna in a Headstand."

00:27.428 --> 00:29.263
Make like you just
met a Hemsworth

00:29.363 --> 00:31.299
and get those legs in the air.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.336
Stop everything!
Guys, meet Trina.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.904
(giggles) Hi.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.640
I'm collecting signatures
for a bill on climate change.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.075
Can I count on your support?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.576
Sure. I'd love to sign.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.112
Oh, aren't you cute?

00:44.212 --> 00:46.680
Sorry, sweetie, this petition
is for grown-ups.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.383
Sure, put grown-ups
in charge of climate change.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.619
So far, so good.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.522
Spencer, we're filming.
You can't just interrupt

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
- while I'm working.
- Oh. What is the use

00:56.590 --> 00:59.927
of work when the planet
is on fire?

01:00.661 --> 01:03.197
Climate change
is the single greatest threat

01:03.297 --> 01:04.532
to our generation.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.700
I talk about it endlessly.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.703
All you talk about endlessly
are robots and marshmallows.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.639
He's just trying
to get Trina's number.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.574
BOTH:
Mm...

01:13.674 --> 01:16.310
Wait. Are you Carly Shay?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.811
I'm a huge fan.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.447
Aw. Thank you.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.349
Yeah, I'd love to sign
your petition.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.255
Aw. On second thought,
you keep it. (giggles)

01:27.355 --> 01:28.822
You've been served.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.691
Big fan, though.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.395
Oh, my God.
I'm being sued.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.396
(all gasp)

01:35.496 --> 01:37.665
But who is Lewbert Sline?

01:37.765 --> 01:41.702
(gasps) Lewbert was
our old doorman and archnemesis.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.337
He quit after Carly
moved to Italy.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.705
Just up and left mysteriously.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.040
- (all gasp)
- (Spencer gasps loudly)

01:47.141 --> 01:49.910
Why are you gasping?
You know all this already.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.013
I just realized her name
probably wasn't Trina.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.750
* I know you see *

01:56.850 --> 01:59.253
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:59.353 --> 02:02.656
* And be so wonderful *

02:02.756 --> 02:06.694
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

02:06.794 --> 02:08.362
* It's your time to be *

02:08.462 --> 02:11.399
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

02:11.499 --> 02:13.033
* And the time to see *

02:13.133 --> 02:17.338
* The brighter side
of every situation *

02:17.438 --> 02:19.139
* Some things are meant to be *

02:19.240 --> 02:22.910
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me. *

02:24.044 --> 02:25.746
* *

02:25.846 --> 02:27.715
(screeching):
Soda machine!

02:27.815 --> 02:29.950
Stole my diet root beer!

02:30.050 --> 02:32.052
(screams)

02:32.953 --> 02:35.556
These videos were called
"Messing With Lewbert."

02:35.656 --> 02:38.025
They were, like,
a perfectly innocent,

02:38.125 --> 02:40.261
just, like,
little pranking sketch.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.596
(screaming)

02:44.598 --> 02:47.635
(laughs)
Oh. God, we were adorable.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.771
And now he's suing me
for wrongful injury,

02:50.871 --> 02:55.376
emotional distress
and irreparable loss of wart.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.377
Can you believe this?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.479
Yes, I can.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.847
"Messing" with someone
is like

02:59.947 --> 03:01.415
hiding your roommate's
phone charger

03:01.515 --> 03:02.850
because she takes
long-ass showers.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.286
- Wait, have you been--
- The point is...

03:05.386 --> 03:07.288
y'all were nasty.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
You don't see
how nasty he was

03:08.989 --> 03:10.824
in those sketches, okay?
He terrorized us.

03:10.924 --> 03:15.363
And he had this blood-curdling,
soul-piercing scream.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.698
(screams)

03:17.798 --> 03:19.267
That's my Lewbert.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.302
I do all of you guys, too.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.037
Carly, no judge would ever
side with Lewbert.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.105
He's the worst.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.374
You're right.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.009
But, just in case,
I have a plan.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.311
I'll apologize.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.179
I'll show some remorse

03:32.280 --> 03:34.582
and all this will go away.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.417
That may work
when you try all of the grapes

03:36.517 --> 03:37.718
at the supermarket, but--

03:37.818 --> 03:39.186
- Oh, no. Those are--
- FREDDIE: Carly,

03:39.287 --> 03:41.589
those are not free samples.
They are for sale.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.860
Guys, there's no way
Lewbert wins this case,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.429
and I would know,
I went to law school

03:48.529 --> 03:50.230
for three days.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.232
Every time you bring up
law school, I think,

03:52.333 --> 03:53.734
"He took someone's spot."

03:53.834 --> 03:56.737
If your apology doesn't work,
I'll represent you

03:56.837 --> 03:58.439
and get this case thrown out
in 15 minutes.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.310
Guaranteed. Ten, if I don't get
hammered the night before.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.811
So probably 15.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.946
Great.
You all got this handled.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.481
I'll stay here
and watch Millicent.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.982
You're not gonna come
and support

04:09.082 --> 04:10.484
your best friend
in her hour of need?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.353
Carly, I'm Black.
I spend too much time

04:12.453 --> 04:14.988
at the courthouse, something
ends up being my fault.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.791
* *

04:20.428 --> 04:23.030
Millicent, do you want to see
my new sticker?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.264
Shh. Reading.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.835
Hey, Olive, your mom's here.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.470
Finally!

04:29.570 --> 04:32.906
I-I mean, aw, already?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.944
But we didn't check the oil
and bond futures yet.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.314
Let's save some fun
for next time. Bye.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.053
Do you ever feel like
you're more sophisticated

04:46.153 --> 04:47.688
than your friends?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.257
Of course you do,
you're friends with Carly.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.727
Well, she does
call them, "quesa-dill-as."

04:53.827 --> 04:55.729
Olive and I aren't vibing.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.565
She's still
into playing horsies.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.400
And I'm trying to bet on them.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.770
Well, it's normal for girls
to mature at different speeds.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.171
Look, take me.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.973
I was the last person
in my friend group

05:06.073 --> 05:08.041
to consider admissions fraud.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.410
Thanks, bestie.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.379
I love that word.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.114
The way you Gen-Zers
just use it all over the place.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.449
I mean, us Gen-Zers.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.917
I'm a Gen-Zer, right, bestie?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.786
You want me to say
you're a Gen-Zer?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.621
I'd like to hear it
out loud, yes.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.956
* *

05:25.292 --> 05:26.927
All right, Carly,
apologize and we're out.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.328
I can't stand being
around Lewbert.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.530
Yeah, he makes my skin crawl.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.531
(Freddie and Spencer shudder)

05:30.631 --> 05:32.265
His lack of hygiene,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.167
that awful, grating voice--

05:34.267 --> 05:36.336
Hello, Carly.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.672
So lovely to see you again.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.875
Lewbert?
Is that really you?

05:41.975 --> 05:46.747
You look handsome,
but also approachable.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.482
You're like Paul Rudd.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.818
Very kind of you to say.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.054
I also want to say
that I'm really sorry

05:54.154 --> 05:56.356
for the way that we treated you
when we were kids.

05:56.457 --> 06:00.694
I-It was immature, and silly.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.797
Wow.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.066
I feel so much better.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.736
That was a great moment
for us.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.671
(gavel bangs)

06:10.771 --> 06:12.272
Court is in session.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.375
I have in front of me
the civil suit

06:15.476 --> 06:17.411
of Sline v. Shay.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.714
Oh, um, Your Majesty...

06:23.484 --> 06:25.486
I have some good news.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.287
I apologized to Mr. Sline

06:27.387 --> 06:31.492
in a very sincere
and respectful way.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.461
So, what do you say, Lewbie?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.395
You want to forget
about this whole thing?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.964
I don't think so, Carly.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.500
Your Honor, I'm seeking damages
for the way Ms. Shay

06:39.600 --> 06:42.035
tortured me and left me
permanently disfigured.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.005
How are you disfigured?
You look fine.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.041
You could pass for a dad
in a Propecia commercial.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.277
LEWBERT:
Be that as it may,

06:50.377 --> 06:52.880
I've literally lost
the ability to smile.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.216
My once melodic voice
is now flat and lifeless.

06:56.316 --> 07:00.754
And, worst of all,
I lost... my wart.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.290
Spencer Shay for the defense!

07:03.390 --> 07:05.893
His "injuries"
are self-inflicted.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.962
He would work himself up,
and flail around

07:09.062 --> 07:12.165
like a bird with another bird
up its ass.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.301
(squawking)

07:16.336 --> 07:19.707
Your Honor, this is exactly
why I'm suing Ms. Shay

07:19.807 --> 07:21.609
for one million dollars.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.911
- (all gasp)
- Oh, really?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.846
You're gonna ask
for a million dollars

07:25.946 --> 07:27.915
and not do the Dr. Evil
pinkie thing?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.449
God, I hate you, Lewbert!

07:30.217 --> 07:32.352
Spencer!
A sidebar, if you will?

07:32.452 --> 07:36.123
I do not have
one million dollars.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.092
Ugh.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.829
(as Dr. Evil):
One million dollars.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.765
We're gonna fight this.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.135
Lewbert, I will see you
in court!

07:48.235 --> 07:50.037
Carly, we're already in court.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.405
I know, but how many other
chances will I have to say that?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.842
Several. We did a lot
of messed-up stuff

07:54.942 --> 07:56.176
when we were kids.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.416
* *

08:03.517 --> 08:05.485
Carly, are you sure
Spencer can pull this off?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.320
Objection!
Move to strike

08:07.420 --> 08:10.257
Freddie's annoying
negative opinion.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.092
The trial hasn't even
started yet.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.361
I'll allow it.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.066
Hello, Your Honor.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.434
I stand before you,
ready to establish mens rea.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.370
Objection! Mens rea?

08:23.470 --> 08:26.106
Isn't that the dating app
for famous people?

08:26.206 --> 08:28.275
No. That's Raya.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.744
I would know.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.480
Sustained.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.949
"Mens rea" is a legal term

08:36.049 --> 08:37.951
that means
"intent of wrong-doing."

08:38.051 --> 08:40.988
After I left the Bushwell,
I put myself through law school,

08:41.088 --> 08:43.456
and now I have a successful
personal injury firm

08:43.557 --> 08:45.893
called, "Sue With Lew."

08:46.660 --> 08:49.496
I call to the stand
Fredward Benson!

08:49.597 --> 08:50.931
(Freddie chuckles)

08:51.031 --> 08:52.700
I'm gonna bury him.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.234
This is gonna be
the best day of my life.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.871
You really need to get out more,
but go get 'em, tiger!

08:58.906 --> 09:00.908
* *

09:01.709 --> 09:03.476
MILLICENT:
I'm so glad you suggested
this spa day.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.746
I'm already feeling better
about dumping Olive.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.248
You dumped Olive?

09:09.249 --> 09:12.085
Faster than a couple that got
engaged on The Bachelor.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.822
I need someone older
who I vibe with.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.790
And I'm loving these vibes.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.458
And you called me bestie, so...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.628
Yeah, everyone uses
that term now.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.529
My bank's Twitter
calls me bestie.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.333
Oh. Okay.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.468
It's 'cause I was having
so much fun,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.138
and my face is feeling
so exfoliated.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.142
Does that mean
we aren't besties?

09:36.509 --> 09:39.212
Uh... of course we are!

09:39.312 --> 09:40.714
I'm just playing
with you, bestie!

09:40.814 --> 09:42.650
Ah, you got me, bestie!

09:42.750 --> 09:44.918
I love fake-outs.
So mature of us.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.889
Or "ma-ture." Adults love
to hit that T hard.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.758
* *

09:52.325 --> 09:57.064
Muffins? Well!
Don't mind if I do.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.166
(screams)

10:00.033 --> 10:02.335
Pretty horrific,
wouldn't you say?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.971
No, I wouldn't.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.106
- And none of it was--
- Your idea?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.507
Oh, I know, sweet Freddie.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.742
After all, whose name
is on the show?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.711
(scoffs) Carly.
But that's not--

10:10.811 --> 10:14.381
Your fault.
Of course not, I agree.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.883
Why wasn't it "WeCarly"?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.484
We actually did discuss it,

10:17.584 --> 10:18.952
but apparently it tested poorly.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.287
With who?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.321
Carly.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.024
It ain't called the "We-ternet."

10:24.124 --> 10:25.759
And isn't it true
you had a deep,

10:25.859 --> 10:27.995
unrequited love for Carly?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.930
Hey, it was occasionally
requited.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.065
Like when I threw myself
in front of a taco truck

10:32.165 --> 10:33.066
to save her.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.102
So only when you're hurt.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.570
(chuckles) Sounds less like love
and more like pity.

10:37.671 --> 10:41.074
Well, if you're gonna go off
of how it sounds,

10:41.174 --> 10:43.510
and looks, and is...

10:43.610 --> 10:44.978
then yes.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.647
And now aren't you back
where you started?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.017
Producing iCarly,
doing her bidding,

10:50.117 --> 10:53.186
even entering
into a fake relationship,

10:53.286 --> 10:55.488
all for whose benefit?

10:55.588 --> 10:56.824
Carly.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.760
Oh, God.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.895
What has become of me?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.131
Who am I?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.899
No further questions,
Your Honor.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.568
Spencer!
You gotta do something.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.437
Get Freddie back
on our side.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.674
Your Honor, permission to wrap
the witness in a warm hug.

11:15.743 --> 11:19.179
Your Honor, I've got
a slew of other witnesses,

11:19.279 --> 11:23.083
all who will attest
to Carly's horrific ways.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
* *

11:27.520 --> 11:31.358
He got Guppy? What bad things
is he gonna say about us?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.293
He's sweet.
Hi, Guppy!

11:33.393 --> 11:34.928
Happy birthday!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.063
Ah!

11:36.163 --> 11:39.032
Don't look at her,
Mr. Gibson.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.769
I called you here
because you were witness

11:41.869 --> 11:45.238
to the pain and suffering
inflicted by Carly Shay

11:45.338 --> 11:46.639
on your brother, Gibby.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.341
BOTH:
Gibby!

11:48.441 --> 11:52.345
Well, Gibby wanted to do
those stunts most of the time.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.981
Uh-huh! Most of the time,

11:54.081 --> 11:57.584
which means some of the time
he didn't want to do them.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.552
Let the record show
some of the time

11:59.652 --> 12:01.254
he didn't wanna do them!

12:03.190 --> 12:05.458
I liked it better when
I just said happy birthday.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.161
Is it anyone's birthday?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.699
Happy birthday!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.071
I call to the stand
model Bushwell tenant,

12:18.171 --> 12:21.174
and just the cutest little angel
you've ever seen,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.176
Chuck Chambers!

12:23.276 --> 12:25.278
No. No! No.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.249
What's in the box?
What's in the box?!

12:30.650 --> 12:31.852
Tell us why you're here today.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.686
To state that the Shay siblings

12:33.787 --> 12:35.555
are evil incarnate.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.827
Carly played mind games
with me when she was my tutor.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.630
And Spencer,
he locked me in a cage.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.099
He squirted me
with suspicious liquid,

12:46.199 --> 12:49.702
and once, he threw
a cupcake at me.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.206
You liar!
You did all that stuff to me!

12:53.306 --> 12:54.774
Spencer!
Get it together.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.243
He brought Chuck here
to throw you off your game.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.677
Oh, you're right.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.279
Just breathe, Spencey.
Take a sip of water.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.613
You wish it was water.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.951
Come here,
you little demon elf!

13:04.051 --> 13:06.153
- (gavel banging)
- JUDGE MATTHEWS: Order, order!

13:06.253 --> 13:07.687
Stop that!

13:07.787 --> 13:08.755
Get him out of here!

13:08.856 --> 13:09.990
You want the truth?

13:10.090 --> 13:12.559
You can't handle the truth!

13:12.659 --> 13:14.727
Avenge me, Carly!

13:16.729 --> 13:21.301
Um, Your Excellency...

13:22.535 --> 13:24.271
...in light of--

13:24.371 --> 13:26.206
well, you saw it--

13:26.306 --> 13:30.777
I hereby nominate myself
to represent myself.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.846
Can I do that?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.082
Only if you grab me
one of those cupcakes.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.486
* *

13:39.586 --> 13:41.021
Carter, let's hurry.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.389
If we're late, they'll seat us
at a communal table,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.357
and I'm not sitting
next to a paralegal

13:44.457 --> 13:45.792
who had a bad day.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.096
Or... we could always
just stay here.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.430
Oh.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.365
Hey, bestie!

13:52.465 --> 13:55.468
Um... hey, Millicent.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.736
Now's not a good time.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.471
We're actually about
to go to dinner.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.240
Hey, little mama.
I'm Carter.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.410
I'm not your mother, Carter.
I'm Harper's bestie.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.546
Wait.
You guys are best friends? Cool.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.415
So are you really young,
or really short?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.550
No judgment either way.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.254
So we're gonna go, but you can
stay as long as you like.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.891
Hold up. I got some questions
for this one.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.960
Where were you born?
What's your credit score?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.995
Why are you not wearing socks?

14:22.095 --> 14:25.265
You're not going on a boat.
Are you going on a boat?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.435
Um... I should go.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.403
I think you need to put
your bestie in time-out.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.840
No, wait. You have such great
bone structure, please.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.743
His loss, bestie.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.212
Now, let's hang out forever.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.481
* *

14:43.483 --> 14:44.918
So what's your plan?

14:45.018 --> 14:47.620
I have called up the one
person who hates Lewbert

14:47.720 --> 14:49.156
as much as we do.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.861
I'm going to turn that doorman
into a doormat.

14:54.962 --> 14:55.862
Nailed it.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.530
* *

14:57.630 --> 15:00.433
Lewbert was a horrible menace
to everyone in the building.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.004
He turned the Bushwell
into the Bush hell.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.905
Nailed it again, Benson.
(giggles)

15:06.906 --> 15:09.609
Wow, Mrs. Benson,
thank you

15:09.709 --> 15:11.911
for that
case-shattering testimony.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.715
Lewbert, the witness
is all yours.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.386
(sighs) She was once mine,
wasn't she?

15:20.387 --> 15:21.989
Hello, Marissa.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.924
Seeing you almost makes me
want to smile again.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.694
But, sadly, I was robbed
of that ability

15:27.794 --> 15:29.929
by one Ms. Carly Shay.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.832
Can it, Lewb.
I'm not falling for it.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.601
But I fell for you.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.136
You nursed me back to health

15:36.236 --> 15:38.638
after Carly's exploding
muffin basket attack.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.873
You put cream
on my-- (gasps)

15:40.974 --> 15:42.642
Oh, I can't even say it.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.776
Your wart.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.545
(gasps)

15:45.645 --> 15:47.514
I can still smell your perfume.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.684
And you never forget the scent
of your first love.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.820
Permission to kiss the witness.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.788
Permission freaking granted.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.724
(both moan)

15:57.824 --> 16:00.127
Objection!

16:00.227 --> 16:02.195
(screams)

16:02.295 --> 16:05.298
Your Honor, are you gonna
let this just happen

16:05.398 --> 16:06.299
in your courtroom?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.534
Yeah.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.869
I am strangely into it.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.971
Ugh...

16:12.072 --> 16:14.507
Mrs. Benson was
our last hope.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.376
We're screwed.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.913
Your Honor, I no longer
want to sue Ms. Carly Shay

16:21.014 --> 16:22.182
for one million dollars.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.851
He didn't do
the pinky thing again!

16:24.951 --> 16:26.919
Thank God.
He's dropping the case.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.988
(chuckles)
Wrong again, Carlificent!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.390
I just want more.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.526
I want the money
and ownership of iCarly.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.794
(all gasp)

16:34.894 --> 16:36.796
What?
You can't take that from me.

16:36.896 --> 16:41.368
But you can take as much of me
as you want, you greedy bastard.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.904
(grunts)

16:48.041 --> 16:50.277
(Lewbert and Mrs. Benson moan)

16:55.582 --> 16:57.384
This is really it.
Lewbert Sline is going

16:57.484 --> 16:59.552
to destroy my life.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.054
This is the end of iCarly.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.922
(screeches)

17:03.756 --> 17:06.659
Freddie, Lewbert smiled.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.129
I think I know
how to win this.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.167
Your Grace...

17:15.335 --> 17:17.170
I, Carly Shay,

17:17.270 --> 17:19.639
call myself, Carly Shay,

17:19.739 --> 17:21.040
to the stand.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.111
If I may be permitted
this rare privilege.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.046
Dear, well, that literally
happens all the time.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.882
Well, it's new to me,
so I think it's exciting.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.785
* *

17:32.885 --> 17:36.523
Are you enjoying your adult meal
of cauliflower crust pizza

17:36.623 --> 17:39.759
with cashew cheese
and tofu pepperoni?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.894
You can't just call things
other things

17:41.994 --> 17:44.131
and pretend they actually
taste good.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.367
So, thanks for taking me
to your lawyer's office

17:47.467 --> 17:48.735
so I can make a living will.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.904
It was very fun,
and not at all depressing.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.040
Your life seems
like so much more fun

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
- when I see you with Carly.
- Oh, at our age,

17:56.243 --> 17:58.678
we're just riding high
on supplements.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.980
Oh, well, I'm out.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.649
Carly's getting killed
in trial,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.584
and I gotta risk it all
to support her in court.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.287
- You got our pizza?
- Huh?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.956
I got spa day,
you get this.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.691
That's what adult besties do.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.327
And you're
my adult bestie, right?

18:14.427 --> 18:18.298
Yes, sure am, and I definitely
have the money.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.934
Ha!
(forced laugh)

18:22.034 --> 18:25.905
Okay, well, love you, mean it.
Bye, bestie. (smooches)

18:34.214 --> 18:35.515
Oh, hello, Millicent.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.083
Fancy meeting you here.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.918
Olive, I was wrong.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.420
Grown-up stuff is not fun.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.656
They spend all their time
getting stuff reappraised.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.860
I'm sorry, Olive.
I should've been your bestie.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.396
Instead, I was your worstie.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.563
I forgive you.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.632
But, hey, who's gonna pay

18:52.732 --> 18:55.067
- for this nasty pizza?
- Nobody.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.969
Kids dine and dash.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.605
Let's go, bestie.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.407
* *

19:00.507 --> 19:02.175
Dash, Olive, dash!

19:02.275 --> 19:03.976
* *

19:04.076 --> 19:09.182
Wow, three hours
of all my wrongdoings.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.184
You want to take a break?

19:11.284 --> 19:14.521
Mm. I've got stamina.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.655
Just ask Marissa.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.890
I was perpetually exhausted.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.660
I am going to set myself
on fire.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.065
Is there anything
you'd like to say for yourself?

19:26.165 --> 19:30.737
Yes.
I want to say thank you.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.006
Objection! I...

19:34.106 --> 19:35.475
Huh?

19:35.575 --> 19:38.511
Do you remember when you sneezed
into Spencer's open mouth

19:38.611 --> 19:40.247
- and got him sick?
- Ooh, I do!

19:40.347 --> 19:43.716
It tasted like seaweed
and dirty kitchen sponge.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.184
That was an accident.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.187
But that accident led
to so much more.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.623
After Spencer got sick,
he couldn't take me

19:50.723 --> 19:52.225
to the Air Force
Father-Daughter Dance,

19:52.325 --> 19:55.094
so my dad came from Italy
and he took me instead.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.931
Right after she said "no"
to me taking her.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.400
I'm fine.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.436
I went back with him to Italy,
where I fell in love

20:03.536 --> 20:05.004
with gelato.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.274
And then, when I came back here,
Skybucks was trying out

20:07.374 --> 20:09.509
these new gelato-infused lattes.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.478
Oh. "Ge-lattes."

20:11.578 --> 20:12.879
We melted ice cream
into coffee

20:12.979 --> 20:15.648
and charged people $12.
Allegedly.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.852
And that's where I met Harper.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.921
I love who I am today.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.190
So, win or lose this case,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.225
no one can take that
away from me.

20:26.326 --> 20:32.532
My life is so much better now,
thanks...

20:32.632 --> 20:34.867
to you.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.072
(screaming)
Your life is better?

20:40.172 --> 20:42.409
(shrieking): No!

20:44.411 --> 20:46.879
Are you kidding me?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.481
Her life is better?

20:48.581 --> 20:52.585
(shrieks)
Three years of law school

20:52.685 --> 20:55.355
and student loans

20:55.455 --> 21:00.627
and selling my hair
like Fantine from Les Mis.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.228
(shrieks)

21:02.329 --> 21:05.465
Wait. Did you go to law school
just to get back at me?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.966
Of course I did!

21:07.066 --> 21:11.371
And now you thanking me!

21:11.471 --> 21:13.340
(shrieks)

21:19.846 --> 21:22.382
Oh, my God! The wart!

21:22.482 --> 21:25.184
- I need the name
of that concealer.
- Same.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.186
(shrieks)

21:27.286 --> 21:28.921
Oh!

21:29.689 --> 21:31.190
Oh!

21:31.290 --> 21:32.659
Oof! (sneezes)

21:32.759 --> 21:34.761
(screams) No!

21:34.861 --> 21:36.629
Not again! Ugh!

21:36.729 --> 21:39.332
(shrieking)

21:43.202 --> 21:46.339
You see? This is
what I was talking about.

21:46.439 --> 21:51.378
He's unhinged, untrustworthy,
and clearly unwell.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.713
I move to dismiss.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.083
- Yes!
- (all cheering)

21:58.985 --> 22:02.589
No, that's not how court works.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.924
Why? He was faking everything.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.960
This man is guilty
of being shrill and repulsive,

22:08.060 --> 22:10.296
but you tormented him.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.564
I'm ruling in his favor.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.466
So Lewbert gets my show?

22:13.566 --> 22:15.968
That's also not how court works.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.137
Have you heard
of the First Amendment?

22:18.237 --> 22:21.408
You can't stop someone
from making an okay web show.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.110
Well, it's not for you,
Your Honor.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.650
Your actions have
consequences, Ms. Shay.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.387
I'm awarding Mr. Sline
$250,000

22:34.487 --> 22:35.922
for pain and suffering.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.757
(gavel bangs)

22:37.857 --> 22:39.892
You can cheer now.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.695
(scattered clapping)

22:42.795 --> 22:45.565
(faintly):
Yay. What a victory.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.367
* *

22:48.468 --> 22:50.603
To Carly, for putting Lewbert
in his place.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.907
And to Spencer,
for paying that settlement.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.609
(laughter)

22:56.709 --> 22:58.277
What are brothers for?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.547
Sure, I won't be able
to get that animatronic giraffe

23:00.647 --> 23:03.115
that chews my salad for me.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.384
Just kidding, I'm getting it.
I'm really rich, guys.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.455
How'd you know your speech
was gonna crack Lewbert?

23:08.555 --> 23:11.090
'Cause he said he lost
his ability to smile,

23:11.190 --> 23:12.792
but then he smiled
when he thought

23:12.892 --> 23:14.594
I was gonna lose everything.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.762
I knew he was faking it.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.464
You know who isn't faking it?

23:17.564 --> 23:20.933
My mom. I really regret
sharing a wall.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.970
- Get it, Grandma B.
- Mm. Uh-uh.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.438
Silver lining to the trial.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.874
Chuck and I made up.
He even got me another box

23:27.974 --> 23:29.809
of cupcakes
as a peace offering.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.444
- Mm...
- No.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.945
Uh, people do change...

23:33.613 --> 23:35.347
Oh!

23:38.551 --> 23:40.553
Deliciously played, Chuck.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.921
Deliciously played.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.923
* *

23:48.961 --> 23:51.998
* *

24:11.283 --> 24:12.985
Ooh!

24:13.085 --> 24:15.488
MAN:
He hates these cans.
