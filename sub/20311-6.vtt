00:02.127 --> 00:04.630
Jonathan: Sir, did you watch
wrestling yesterday?

00:04.630 --> 00:07.132
Gerry: No I did not, Jonathan,
because wrestling is not real.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.926
Jonathan: Sir, are
you kidding me?

00:08.926 --> 00:10.928
Sheila: Sir, are you going to
talk about the homework?

00:10.928 --> 00:13.138
Gerry: Sheila, I'm in the middle
of a conversation with Jonathan.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.599
Jonathan: Sir, I promise you it
is very real, I do that stuff

00:15.599 --> 00:16.851
all the time with
my little brother

00:16.851 --> 00:18.769
Gerry: Ok, come
on up here Jonathan.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.230
I'm going to let Jonathan do one
of his "wrestling" moves

00:22.230 --> 00:25.693
to show you people
that wrestling is fake,
and here we go.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.864
Show me what you got...
Oh there it is....that's...

00:29.864 --> 00:34.284
Student: Oh, my god.
Students gasp

00:34.284 --> 00:36.704
Jonathan: It's alright,
don't worry, I only put a
light sleeper on him.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.504
Gerry: What are you doing? Sit.
Jonathan: Are you ok, Sir?

00:45.504 --> 00:48.298
Gerry: What are you doing?
Am I ok? Stop fooling around.

00:48.298 --> 00:52.636
Sit down everybody.
Get back to work.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.434
Jonathan: Ah, Sir, did you
watch wrestling yesterday?

00:59.434 --> 01:03.146
Gerry: No, I did not Jonathan,
because wrestling is not real.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.733
Jonathan: Sir, wrestling is very
real. Are you kidding me?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.651
Me and my brother do that
kind of stuff all the time.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.487
Gerry: Alright Jonathan,
come on up here,

01:10.487 --> 01:15.075
I'm going to let Jonathan do one
of his "wrestling" moves on me.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.869
Let's see what
you got tough guy.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.551
Gerry: Come on in girls.
No glasses?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.177
Simon: I never wear
them to play sports.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.095
Gerry: Simon, you're
not playing.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.015
Simon: I was thinking of getting
in there and scrimmaging a bit.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.183
Gerry: No, remember what
happened last time?

01:40.183 --> 01:42.686
Simon: No.
Gerry: What do you got
goin on with the shirt today?

01:42.686 --> 01:45.146
Simon: Gretzky.
Gerry: Gretzky.

01:45.146 --> 01:50.652
Alright girls in order to start
playing like a team you
need to look like a team.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.031
Simon: Which is why...
Gerry: Simon, Simon, which is
why I make these announcements.

01:54.031 --> 01:58.201
Which is why I, by myself,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.995
went out and bought you
your own tracksuits.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.205
Girls: Yeah! Yes!
Gerry: For everybody.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.917
Gabby: Really? We're all getting
one? Even the bad players?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.628
Gerry: Strap, there are no bad
players only weaker players,

02:07.628 --> 02:11.214
and yes you are getting one
and so is Lucy as well.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.216
You're also going to get
matching game shirts.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.843
Lucy: Will our names
be on the jerseys?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.637
Gerry: Your names
will be on the shirts,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.597
just like the WNBA players,

02:18.597 --> 02:20.766
except it'll be your,
your first name.

02:20.766 --> 02:24.103
Lucy: But Sir, the WNBA players
have their last names on them.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.563
Gerry: But Lucy DeBenedictis,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.399
WNBA players make thousands
a dollars a year

02:29.399 --> 02:32.569
so they can afford to have names
like DeBenedictis, which
they don't have anyway.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.238
Simon: Quanitra Hollingsworth
on Minnesota has a pretty long
name.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.909
Gerry: Ok, so there's a good
example, maybe of one.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.578
Simon: Courtney Vandersloot
on Chicago's another one.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.831
Gerry: Well then perhaps Mr.
Hunt, you would like to pay

02:43.831 --> 02:47.334
for the extra letters so they
can have their full names
on the jerseys.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.422
Simon: I would not.
Gerry: I didn't think so.

02:52.422 --> 02:57.385
Now, here is a sample,
this is mine "Coach"

02:57.385 --> 02:59.220
to show you what
they will look like.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.932
Lucy: It doesn't fit.
Gerry: No, it doesn't fit.

03:01.932 --> 03:06.812
Ok, well yours will fit
and you will start to look
like a real team

03:06.812 --> 03:10.065
and hopefully play
like one, alright?
So go get warmed up.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.818
Why does it not...?
Women's, women's large.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.528
Simon: I wear a women's
large, can I have it?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.238
Gerry: Yeah, could you have it?
Are you the coach?

03:17.238 --> 03:20.159
Simon: Ahhh, I am not the coach.
Gerry: No, no and never will be.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.286
Simon: You know what? Sue Bird
would have been a good name for
a jersey. Nice and short.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.288
Gerry: Freaking me out
with all this knowledge.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.749
Simon: Played for Seattle,
one of the best ever.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.710
Bobbi: Yeah, reimbursement
for what?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.629
Gerry: For the $1500 I spent out
of my own pocket for the girls'

03:32.629 --> 03:35.632
tracksuits and I don't
want to call myself a hero
but they were pretty excited.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.468
Bobbi: Oh, we don't have
that kind of money,
and even if we did

03:38.468 --> 03:40.929
you have to go through
approval before you can order
those kinds of things.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.432
Gerry: Let's pretend I got the
approval and send it in to the
person who does the approvals.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.851
Bobbi: I do the approvals.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.145
Gerry: Oh, so you gonna
approve this?

03:48.145 --> 03:50.022
Bobbi: No, I'm not gonna.
Gerry: No, you know why?

03:50.022 --> 03:52.315
'Cause you're sexist.
It's a girls team.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.442
If it was a boys team you would.
Bobbi: Right, yeah.

03:54.442 --> 03:58.405
I'm a woman who's sexist Gerry.
Now read my lips
we don't have the money ok?

03:58.405 --> 04:01.867
Gerry: And that is why women
should not control
the money, Bobbi.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.079
Bobbi: Ok, that is sexist.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.707
Gerry: Yes, it is.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.542
Trudy: Knock, knock.
Am I interrupting?

04:10.542 --> 04:13.378
Lisa: No, not at all.
Trudy: I need you to sign this.

04:18.008 --> 04:22.221
Lisa: Ok, what's wrong?
Robert: You don't wanna know.

04:22.221 --> 04:26.058
Lisa: Ok.
Robert: I had this dream
last night about Trudy.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.809
Lisa: Yeah,
I don't want to know.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.187
Robert: I was lying in this
field way out in the country
and,

04:30.187 --> 04:35.150
and Trudy was lying there too.
Lisa: Wow, Robert I really
don't wanna know any of this.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.945
Robert: You're right,
it's too much to share.
Lisa: Yeah.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.114
Robert: Isn't it?

04:40.114 --> 04:44.576
Gerry: I need some better
ideas guys, this, this pinata,
unless it's full of money

04:44.576 --> 04:47.621
not, not gonna do it.
Gabby: Why can't we
have a bake sale?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.207
Gerry: We've already
gone through this,
we can't have a bake sale,

04:50.207 --> 04:51.750
bake sales don't raise
a lot of money.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.334
Stephan: How 'bout a cookie
sale?

04:53.334 --> 04:55.170
Gerry: Stephan, how do you make
cookies?

04:55.170 --> 04:59.758
Stephan: I don't know.
Gerry: You bake 'em...
same thing.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.927
I need a really good idea.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.931
Lucy: Oh, at my birthday party,
I was given lots of money.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.849
Maybe we could throw
a birthday party.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.435
Gerry: Does anyone have a parent
that could just donate $1500?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.229
That would be, that would
be a good fundraiser.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.023
Lucy: My mom and dad gave me
$100 for my birthday party.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.277
Gerry: There we go.
Thank you. $1400 now.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.321
Stephan: At my cousin's school,
the football team organized
a big dance.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.782
They raised a ton of money.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.493
Gerry: There's our idea.
We gonna do a dance. Nice work.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.120
Stephan: There were
a million people there.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.624
Gerry: No, there were not.
We're gonna have a dance kids.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.418
Gabby: Can we make the posters?
Gerry: Yes Strap,
you can make the posters.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.545
Stephan: How 'bout the tickets?
Gerry: Make the tickets
during class time.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.049
Class: Yay! Yeah!
Gerry: It will take
about three or four days.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.926
Lucy: Can we go?
Gerry: No.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.805
Gabby: Why can't we go?
Gerry: Because dancing
leads to kissing.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.391
Class: Ewwww.
Gerry: Yuck.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.061
Lucy: My mommy told me that
kissing leads to babies.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.897
Gerry: Sometimes.
Yes, Stephan?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.399
Stephan: Sir, I think
sex leads to babies.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.819
Gerry: Ok.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.570
Trudy: Robert dreamt
we were in a field?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.990
Lisa: Yeah.
Trudy laughs

06:04.990 --> 06:09.744
That's great. Could you imagine
having sex anywhere with Robert?

06:09.744 --> 06:12.914
Actually, this is the best news
I've had all year.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.168
Bobbi: What are you gonna do?
Trudy: I'm gonna play with him
a little bit.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.838
I'm gonna come onto him
like a teenager at a prom.

06:19.838 --> 06:25.177
It's gonna be messy and quick
and I'll probably regret it.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.096
Lisa: I am so gonna get fired
for telling you all of this.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.725
Trudy: Oh, Lisa no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Don't you worry.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.978
It'll be worth it.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.523
Attention girls, we have a gig.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.859
I mean these girls, not you.

06:40.859 --> 06:45.989
Gerry: Ticket, tickets?
Oh, Sam! You're not buying
a ticket to the dance?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.991
Sam: Uh Sir, I don't think I'm
going to go.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.702
Gerry: You're not? Oh you're shy
you don't want to ask...

06:50.702 --> 06:52.829
Girls!
Tina: Yeah, what's up?

06:52.829 --> 06:55.540
Gerry: Which one of you
lucky ladies would like
to go to the dance with Sam?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.837
It's not funny Tina.
Tina: Well, Sam's gay Sir.
See ya, Sam.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.049
Gerry: That is not nice Tina.
Sam: Sir, it's true.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.553
Gerry: What? Why wouldn't you
tell me something like that?

07:08.553 --> 07:12.766
Sam: Sir, you never asked.
Gerry: You're supposed to just
tell teachers that stuff.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.561
Well, it's, it's ok to be gay.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.980
It's, it's certainly caught on.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.524
There's weddings now,
there's parades.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.279
In fact, there were no gay
people in the world before 1980.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.364
Sam: I don't think that's true,
Sir.

07:27.364 --> 07:31.743
Gerry: Oh, try to think
of somebody, who was gay before
1980? Nobody.

07:31.743 --> 07:37.165
Elton John, maybe, but he didn't
even know then. Now there's lots

07:37.165 --> 07:40.085
like you and because you're gay
doesn't mean you miss the dance.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.630
You are coming to the
dance. I'm gonna get
you a ticket... Sam!

07:46.258 --> 07:48.676
Bill: Ah man, you shouldn't be
back here, you don't even work
here anymore.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.887
Gerry: I just don't get
why people aren't going to this
dance.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.807
When I was in school
I went to every dance.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.310
I never missed a dance, why
won't people buy tickets.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.396
Bill: I think it's 'cause guys
like you really love going to
dances.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.065
Gerry: Ah, that's funny. Well
that's why I know how to dance

08:02.065 --> 08:04.776
'cause I went to dances.
Bill: What are you saying,
I can't?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.070
Gerry: No
Bill: What? I, oh I can dance.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.905
Does this mean anything to you?
Gerry: It's the only
move you have.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.074
What happens if the song gets
fast?
Bill: I got this.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.034
Gerry: Yeah, it's the same move
Bill, and when it slows down?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.371
Bill: No it's more... make it
sensual.
Gerry: No, it's not.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.290
So bad.
Bill: The teeth.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.667
Bill: No, no, it's good man.
Man you want a good dance all

08:20.667 --> 08:23.628
you need is two things,
you need cool kids and
good music, that's it.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.340
Gerry: You just gave
me a good idea...
Bill: You want me to DJ.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.843
Gerry: No, I gotta get the cool
kid to come to the dance and

08:29.843 --> 08:33.430
they'll bring everybody
else, and I need a DJ.
Bill: Right, $100.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.391
Gerry: $50. Done. Let's do a
shot.
Bill: Deal. Let's do a shot!

08:36.391 --> 08:39.936
Gerry: Celebrate that I get
all the money back
Bill: Now we're talking.

08:39.936 --> 08:44.483
that I spent on the dance.
A toast, ok?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.609
Bill: Are you serious?
Gerry: Take that one.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.154
Ok, you gonna? Ok
Bill: No.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.490
Gerry: Just...

08:59.164 --> 09:00.790
Gerry: Just do it.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.672
Gerry: Can't breathe, can't
breathe, can't breathe.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.801
Sam: Sir, I think I'm
going to the dance.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.679
Gerry: Oh, you found someone?
Sam: Yeah,
but I haven't asked him yet.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.392
Gerry: Ah, you're too shy. What
is he on a scale of one to ten?
Sam: He's like a ten.

09:18.392 --> 09:23.063
Gerry: Mmm that's a little outta
your league, ok, ah, wow a ten
in the gay.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.940
See in the straight
world I'm a 7.5 looks,

09:25.940 --> 09:29.152
but I'm a 9.5 personality,
so I play my personality more.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.112
What do you think I'd
be in the gay community?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.907
Sam: You'd be, like, a four.
Gerry: A four?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.536
Sam: Maybe a five, maybe it's
because I know you're not gay.

09:37.536 --> 09:42.707
Gerry: Pretend I'm gay, hold on.
Sam: Oh sir, now you're a ten!

09:42.707 --> 09:44.918
Gerry: See how that works? See I
could be gay if I wanted.

09:44.918 --> 09:49.839
Ok, let me give you some advice,
you're a six looks, but you're a
9.5 personality.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.050
You need to play the personality
more. If you wanna get a 10

09:52.050 --> 09:55.595
and you're only a six looks
you can't let him see you for
awhile.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.931
Email him, phone him, text him.
As many things as you can,

09:57.931 --> 10:01.017
let him get to know your great
personality. Ok, once he falls
in love with you

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
for your personality
the looks part won't matter,

10:02.852 --> 10:05.355
and a six/ten difference won't
be as big a deal.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.441
Ok? Go. Go get 'em.
Sam: Alright, thanks Sir.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.235
Gerry: Know how many gay men
I could get if I was gay.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.987
Something to think about...
No, it's not something
to think about...

10:18.285 --> 10:24.958
Trudy: Here are the permission
forms for the grade seven field
trip.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.545
Hmm, warm in here.
Don't you find?

10:28.545 --> 10:31.339
Robert: No. It's a temperature
controlled environment.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.801
Trudy: Sometimes it's good
to lose control, Robert.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.430
Robert: Yeah, well, the school
has pretty strict protocol
on that kind of thing.

10:38.430 --> 10:42.850
Trudy: Mmmm...protocols...

10:44.685 --> 10:48.565
Robert: Anything else?
Trudy: Nope.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.697
Gerry: What's up bijizzles?
Noah: Hey, Sir.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.118
Gerry: What's goin' on Noah?
You guys just chill-axing?

11:00.118 --> 11:03.663
How's life at St. Pat's?
Sebastian: Good I guess.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.706
Gerry: Good, you guys
coming to the dance?

11:05.706 --> 11:07.875
Noah: I didn't think
other schools were allowed to go
to our dances.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.877
Gerry: Yeah, who told you that?
Noah: I dunno.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.340
Gerry: Exactly, how do
you think you're gonna
meet girls from other schools?

11:13.340 --> 11:17.177
Or maybe guys, I dunno.
Doesn't matter.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.472
Sebastian: So we can come?
Gerry: Yeah you can come.
It's what we want.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.642
Noah: Are you sure? Because if
we get the word out there we can

11:23.642 --> 11:27.395
get lots of other kids to come.
Gerry: That's what I want and
the girls at Xavier

11:27.395 --> 11:29.814
are way hotter than the girls
at St...ok that...

11:29.814 --> 11:34.027
Ok that shouldn't come...
tell them the girls are hotter
at our school than theirs.

11:34.027 --> 11:39.407
Noah: And the, ah, girls at our
school are hotter compared to
the girls at your school.

11:39.407 --> 11:44.787
Gerry: Ok, well that's, probably
shouldn't say that. See ya
at the dance. Pound it out.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.377
Joshua Tree, what's up.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
All right, I get it. Ok.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.548
Come here.
It gets better ok?

11:54.548 --> 11:57.091
Lots of hot guys
at our school too.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.638
Alright, cool.
Is that the mascot of St. Pat's?

12:01.638 --> 12:06.184
Leprechaun? Yeah? Lucky Charms,
Keep eating your Lucky Charms.
You'll get bigger.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.019
Gerry: Well, how are the sales?

12:08.019 --> 12:10.063
Simon: Better, if we're lucky we
might make it.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.981
Gerry: Wait till the St. Pat's
kids start showin' up

12:11.981 --> 12:14.568
and they tell their friends.
Simon: St. Pat's kids?

12:14.568 --> 12:16.653
They're not allowed in.
Gerry: Oh yes they are.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.655
Simon: Well, someone should tell
Callaghan that 'cause
I heard it from him.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.365
Gerry: Callaghan said that?
Simon: Yeah.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.283
Gerry: Why would he say that?
That's how you make a dance.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.661
You have to have kids
from other schools.
Otherwise the dance sucks.

12:24.661 --> 12:29.457
Simon: We have a bad history
with those kids. Fights,
property damage,

12:29.457 --> 12:32.835
name calling,
lots of name calling.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.255
Gerry: They don't show up, we're
not gonna make any money,
they're showing up.

12:35.255 --> 12:39.718
I'm sorry, I'll deal with it.
Oh, sorry girls, we're sold out.

12:39.718 --> 12:45.098
Sorry. Yeah, come earlier next
time. Sorry guys.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.641
Simon: We're not sold out.
Why'd you do that?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.934
Gerry: Told the St. Pat's kids

12:47.934 --> 12:49.519
we'd have good looking
girls at the dance.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.104
I can't have the Manson Family
freak show showing up.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.356
Simon: Mmm.
Gerry: 'Cause they'll
cause damage,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.066
maybe murder.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.911
Simon: St. Pat's huh? Ok.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.207
Lewis the loser has arrived.
Lewis: What was that?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.585
Gerry: Ok, that's enough.
No problems in there
Simon: Ok guys.

13:13.585 --> 13:17.297
tonight please, ok?
Simon: Be cool please dudes,
yup.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.718
Told ya this was risky. That
coulda cost us a $1000.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.720
Gerry: Simon, that does
not cost a $1000.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.139
Simon: Ok.
Gerry: And if there's a problem
we'll kick them out.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.265
Simon: Gotcha.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.892
Robert: Trudy.
Trudy: Hello...

13:32.186 --> 13:35.523
That feels better.
Robert: Good.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.734
Appreciate you staying
late to get that done.

13:37.734 --> 13:43.030
Trudy: It is my pleasure
to stay after hours if you know
what I mean.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.951
Robert: Everything alright?
Trudy: Well it's a little
warm in here isn't it?

13:46.951 --> 13:50.497
I'd probably feel better if I
was lying in a field.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.541
Trudy: In a field...

13:55.168 --> 13:57.754
Trudy: I know you had a sex
dream about me Robert.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.422
Robert: What?
Trudy: Don't give me that.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.551
Lisa told me about the field,
me lying there.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.970
Robert: Yeah dead!
Trudy: What?

14:05.970 --> 14:09.265
Robert: So many wolves Trudy.
I, I tried to stop them,
but I couldn't. They killed you.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.976
And there was a
funeral and I sang.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.104
Trudy: So, it
wasn't a, uh, sex dream?

14:15.104 --> 14:18.817
Robert: Not totally. Wait,
is that what this is about?

14:18.817 --> 14:21.319
Trudy: Nope.
Robert: Yeah, you
thought come here tonight

14:21.319 --> 14:24.280
and have a big
bowl of Cheeley O's huh?
Trudy: Stop that.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.407
Robert: What? I
hurt your Cheelings?

14:26.407 --> 14:30.453
Come on Trudy, I could
never be with you after
what those wolves did to you.

14:30.453 --> 14:34.415
What a way to go.
Trudy: Don't you have a
dance you have to supervise?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.793
Robert: Yeah, but
this is way more fun.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.838
Unless of course they're gonna
play a little Cheeley Dan.

14:42.173 --> 14:45.885
Gerry: DJ's coming.
He'll be here any minute.

14:45.885 --> 14:50.056
Gerry: DJ'll be here soon guys,
just hang tight. Grab a drink...

14:50.056 --> 14:53.393
some chips, text your friends,
lots of room.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.645
Still selling tickets at the
door.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.564
Bill: Hey, man.
Gerry: 7:00 I said.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.191
Bill: Yeah. Oh yeah, ya did.
Gerry: Well, hurry up.

15:00.191 --> 15:04.237
Bill: Alright...
and you owe me 50 bucks.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.489
Music starts
Gerry: That's what
I'm paying for?

15:06.489 --> 15:09.116
Bill: Yeah, that's it.
Pretty sweet scam eh?

15:09.116 --> 15:13.204
Gerry: It's not a sweet scam
why did I get all this?
Bill: I have no idea.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.707
I think probably
this goes side to side.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.709
Gerry: Oh, man Bill.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.381
Gerry: Sam!
Sam: Hey, Mr. D.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.091
Gerry: Who's this?
Sam: This is Kyle.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.760
Gerry: Hey Kyle.
Kyle: Hey Mr. Duncan.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.554
Gerry: You don't even look gay.
So that's...

15:29.554 --> 15:31.806
I never would have thought.
Kyle: Than...thanks?

15:31.806 --> 15:35.184
Gerry: Yeah, anyway have fun.
Glad you guys made it.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.144
Yeah, hey, quick question.
Sam: Yeah?

15:37.144 --> 15:40.815
Gerry: That's a ten?
Sam: No, no he's a seven.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.610
The ten said no.
Gerry: 'Cause I would never give
that a ten.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.529
Ah, don't worry about it, at
least you're moving up
a notch.

15:46.529 --> 15:50.324
I had a ten say no to me once.
I saw her about four years ago,

15:50.324 --> 15:53.453
she's about a four. That's what
six kids'll do to ya.

15:53.453 --> 15:57.415
So maybe that ten that said no
to you, one day they'll look bad
because they'll have six kid...

15:57.415 --> 16:01.168
Forget it, have fun, ok?
Good job, Sam.

16:02.128 --> 16:06.382
New dance song

16:08.509 --> 16:10.261
Music plays

16:13.055 --> 16:16.267
Gerry: You can't do that.
Stop looking like a dork.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.105
Lewis: Noah, what are you doing
here with a St. Pat's girl?

16:21.105 --> 16:25.359
Noah: Just back off, Lewis!
Sebastian: What's wrong with a
St. Pat's girl?

16:25.359 --> 16:27.403
St. Pat's student: Yeah, what
are you gonna do about it?
Seriously.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.572
Ally: Ignore him guys.
Sebastian: Wanna go?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.741
Sebastian: Come on, Lewis.
Let's do this.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.034
Gerry: Ok, ok...hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey excuse me.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.412
That's enough, Lewis
get out of here. Noah go!

16:36.412 --> 16:38.456
Simon: Things are getting ugly.
Gerry: Yeah, thanks, Simon.

16:38.456 --> 16:43.127
Robert: Mr. Duncan!
Why are there students from
St. Pat's at an Xavier dance?

16:43.127 --> 16:46.506
Gerry: I didn't know they were
St. Pat's students.
Robert: Way to do your job.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.425
Gerry: Yeah...
Robert: I bet Callaghan's gonna
love to hear this

16:49.425 --> 16:53.179
when I tell him.
Gerry: Well, make sure you also
tell him that the vice principal

16:53.179 --> 16:56.349
didn't help at the door, leaving
two newer teachers at Xavier

16:56.349 --> 16:58.893
to try and recognize
every kid in the city.

16:58.893 --> 17:02.939
Robert: Well, guess the spider's
laid it's web then, huh?

17:02.939 --> 17:05.942
Simon: Spiders don't lay web,
they lay eggs. They spin webs.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.653
Gerry: Spiders don't sp...
lay eggs they...

17:08.653 --> 17:10.613
Simon: No, spiders do lay
eggs, they don't lay web.

17:10.613 --> 17:14.659
Gerry: Spiders don't lay web,
they lay eggs. Is that right?

17:14.659 --> 17:15.994
Simon: Yeah, that's right,
that's right.
Robert: Gentlemen,

17:15.994 --> 17:17.871
I know what spiders do
and don't do.

17:17.871 --> 17:21.499
Gerry: Checkmate, you're move.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.084
Simon: If it's checkmate
you don't get a move.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.754
Robert: I've played
chess before.

17:26.754 --> 17:31.009
Gerry: Bill, I need you
to calm the kids down
and play a slow song.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.677
Bill: Oh, I don't think I
have a slow song man.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.512
Gerry: How do you not
have a slow song?

17:34.512 --> 17:36.639
Lisa: Gerry, I barely recognize
any of these kids, do you?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.599
Gerry: Not now Lisa.
Bill: Oh! This is Lisa?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.894
Oh see. He said you were
average looking.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.437
Lisa: Oh, really?
Average, that's nice.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.690
Gerry: I did that for your sake,
trust me. Find me a slow song
Bill.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.901
Bill: I'll find a slow song if
Lisa wants to dance with me.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.944
Lisa: Oh no, that would be
totally inappropriate.

17:49.944 --> 17:53.364
Bill: Inappropriate?
Lisa: Yeah, he's told me
a lot about you.

17:53.364 --> 17:57.577
You're a busy man.
Gerry: Ok, busy guy. Ok, busy.
Play a slow song.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.788
Bill: I'm looking, I'm looking.
Gerry: I need a slow song Bill,
right away.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.874
Kids chanting: Fight, fight,
Gerry: Oh god, here we go again.

18:02.874 --> 18:08.170
Kill the music Bill...Hey, hey,
break it up, break it up. That's
enough.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.466
Simon: Break - it - uuuuuup!
Gerry: You guys gotta go, man.

18:12.466 --> 18:16.721
Sebastian: What? Why?
Gerry: 'Cause, it's too many
problems with St. Pat's here.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.474
Well there's a good reason
right there.
We don't drink at our school.

18:20.474 --> 18:24.228
Sebastian: This dance sucks
anyway. Nice one, bud.

18:24.228 --> 18:28.816
Gerry: Come on, you guys.
Go relax for a bit. It's
supposed to be a dance people.

18:28.816 --> 18:33.571
Simon: It's not a fight,
it's a dance.
Gerry: Why is nobody dancing?

18:33.571 --> 18:36.449
Am I the only person that can
dance here? Nobody can dance?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.242
Play something, Bill.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.456
Dance music starts

18:52.673 --> 18:54.759
Music continues

19:21.869 --> 19:23.746
Music continues

19:33.255 --> 19:35.883
Music continues

19:39.095 --> 19:42.222
Gerry: I did that, man.
I did that move.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.644
Simon: I got this, Gerry.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.938
Simon singing: Sucker DJ

19:48.938 --> 19:50.773
Music continues

20:11.460 --> 20:13.462
Robert: Well, way to diffuse
a bomb, Mr. Duncan.

20:13.462 --> 20:17.466
Gerry: That's what
I do, Mr. Cheeley.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.845
Robert: Ya know I've been
known on occasion to back
that thing up myself.

20:20.845 --> 20:24.223
Just if you ever need
a backup dancer.
Gerry: You're a dancer?

20:24.223 --> 20:30.188
Robert: To some people, dancing
is a creative outlet,
to me it's a lifestyle.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.568
Simon: I think we did ok. Might
have even made some extra money.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.822
Gerry: No...Awesome!
Sebastian: Xavier sucks!

20:39.822 --> 20:42.992
Sound of glass shattering
Gerry: That was a window.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.661
Simon: Maybe we broke even.
More glass shattering

20:45.661 --> 20:48.706
Gerry: That sounded
like a bigger window
Simon: Yeah, that was bigger.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.710
Gerry sighs: You're gonna have
to give me half the money for

20:52.710 --> 20:56.255
those track suits and stuff.
Simon: Why?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.175
Gerry: 'Cause we're co-coaches.
Simon: I'm an assistant coach,

20:59.175 --> 21:03.637
you made that very clear.
Gerry: Now we're co-coaches, ok?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.431
Simon: I don't
want the position.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.855
Music starts

21:29.038 --> 21:31.165
Music continues

21:49.183 --> 21:51.894
Music continues
