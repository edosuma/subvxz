WEBVTT

00:31.230 --> 00:34.110
Father. [hesitates]

00:35.490 --> 00:36.320
You're here.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.740
Well, you've got my attention.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.160
Oh, Father, thank you for coming.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.500
You-- you saw how they were attacking me?

00:44.580 --> 00:48.250
And look what Lucifer did to my face.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.340
Yes, of course, oh, this is all my fault.

00:50.420 --> 00:53.550
Go on, go ahead, Dad,
blame it all on me, like always.

00:53.630 --> 00:56.090
No, Father, this is all my fault.

00:56.930 --> 00:59.720
I lost control
and froze time, and as the eldest brother,

00:59.800 --> 01:02.430
I should've kept a better handle
on my siblings. I'm truly sorry.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.230
I don't care who's at fault.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.440
-I just want my sons to get along.
-[scoffs]

01:09.150 --> 01:13.190
Regardless of what's happened,
we're family.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.030
Let's act like it.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.160
Good point, Father. [sighs]

01:20.120 --> 01:20.990
Come on.

01:21.870 --> 01:22.790
Bring it in.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.790
-Uh…
-Come on. Here.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.710
You've got to be joking.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.590
No! Hell, no!

01:35.170 --> 01:36.470
Come now, Samael.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.180
[shudders]

01:38.970 --> 01:42.060
Michael impersonated me,
tried to ruin my life.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.770
Kidnapped the woman that I-- [huffs]

01:44.850 --> 01:47.690
He is behind every bad thing
that's ever happened to me!

01:47.770 --> 01:49.440
Well, everything apart from you.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.860
And for someone
who's supposed to be omniscient,

01:51.940 --> 01:54.320
it's amazing
that you never actually see that!

01:55.940 --> 01:59.490
And apparently never will. [scoffs]

02:01.320 --> 02:02.200
[scoffs]

02:04.870 --> 02:05.830
[mouths] Now?

02:17.590 --> 02:20.510
Is that my grandson over there? Huh.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.470
[chuckles]

02:32.730 --> 02:34.900
Well, now, this won't do at all.

02:38.030 --> 02:40.030
[clamoring]

02:45.580 --> 02:46.790
What just happened?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.370
And who are you?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.470
[sighs]

03:01.550 --> 03:04.390
Hey, oh, my God, are you okay?
That must've been a crazy big earthquake.

03:04.470 --> 03:05.680
Yeah.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.190
Hey, wait. Uh… have you seen Lucifer?

03:11.270 --> 03:13.690
Um, no, sorry.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.450
[high-pitched ringing]

03:36.710 --> 03:37.590
Where is he?

03:37.670 --> 03:40.720
-[rock and roll playing on piano]
-[cheering]

03:42.260 --> 03:45.510
-Ha-ha! Yeah!
-[shouting]

03:45.600 --> 03:48.260
-[laughs]
-Whoo! [laughs]

03:56.060 --> 03:57.020
Here we go!

03:58.270 --> 03:59.110
Big!

04:08.450 --> 04:10.450
[cheering]

04:12.080 --> 04:14.120
[laughs]

04:14.210 --> 04:15.420
Yeah!

04:16.170 --> 04:17.670
Whoo!

04:18.710 --> 04:19.840
Mmm!

04:20.510 --> 04:21.800
[exhales]

04:21.880 --> 04:22.720
Hi.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.970
Detective! Where have you been?

04:25.050 --> 04:27.430
Hey. Um, can I talk to you for a second?

04:28.390 --> 04:29.350
Absolutely!

04:29.430 --> 04:31.430
[dance music playing]

04:40.690 --> 04:44.280
Hey, so,
uh, what happened back at the precinct?

04:45.660 --> 04:49.700
When we were talking,
and, uh, you were about to say…

04:50.410 --> 04:52.750
or at least I thought…

04:53.500 --> 04:56.460
I knew what you were about to say,
and then I blinked, and, well,

04:56.540 --> 04:58.170
suddenly, no you.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.840
Detective, I'm sorry. [exhales]

05:00.920 --> 05:03.590
I needed to get away.
I couldn't take it anymore.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.970
"Take it"?

05:05.050 --> 05:08.050
People!
Telling me what to do, especially--

05:08.140 --> 05:09.010
Me?

05:09.800 --> 05:10.640
No.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.180
No, Detective, I'm sorry, I--

05:13.270 --> 05:16.850
It's okay.
I-- I think I pushed you too far,

05:16.940 --> 05:19.150
and it wasn't fair of me to do that,

05:19.230 --> 05:21.400
and I get why you ran away.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.900
-But that's not why I ran.
-No, I-- I understand.

05:24.610 --> 05:25.950
I really do. Um…

05:27.160 --> 05:30.200
You know, I think, uh,
maybe I'll just give you some time,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.450
and, um, when-when you're ready,

05:34.040 --> 05:35.620
I'll be ready to listen.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.540
Okay?

05:48.550 --> 05:50.550
[Charlie cooing]

05:53.850 --> 05:54.680
Yep.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.690
You're really here.

05:57.770 --> 05:59.770
[sighs] I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

05:59.850 --> 06:00.730
I met Eve

06:00.810 --> 06:02.690
and the Goddess of all creation.

06:03.610 --> 06:08.570
I even thought
I met you once, but still… [chuckles]

06:09.780 --> 06:11.950
Yeah, I'm never
gonna get used to this. Mnh-mnh.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.530
You can poke all you want.

06:14.450 --> 06:16.370
Because I'm eternally grateful to you…

06:17.370 --> 06:19.120
for this beautiful grandson.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.340
-Yeah.
-Who's the cutest little baby?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.590
Yes, it's you.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.050
-That's right.
-[chuckles]

06:27.470 --> 06:30.720
My angel baby
is technically God's grandkid.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.760
Do you need a drink?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.720
Water? Wine?

06:36.470 --> 06:37.680
Is it all the same to you?

06:37.770 --> 06:40.140
Yeah, I'm gonna get some options. Okay.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.110
Father, I do have to
tell you that Lucifer was right.

06:50.030 --> 06:53.120
Michael has made
quite a mess here on Earth.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.200
And I'm afraid he's not done.
He's up to something.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.330
Day-to-day isn't important, my son.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.040
This is important.

07:02.460 --> 07:04.790
-Family's important.
-Yes, I agree.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.420
And that's, um…

07:09.130 --> 07:11.340
that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

07:12.590 --> 07:15.100
About Charlie and, uh…

07:17.930 --> 07:18.770
Father, is he--

07:18.850 --> 07:19.680
Adorable?

07:20.850 --> 07:21.940
Yes, he is, my son.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.520
God's honest truth.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.980
-Yes, but, Father, I--
-You know what?

07:26.070 --> 07:28.860
Being here gives me an idea.

07:30.190 --> 07:31.030
Yeah?

07:32.490 --> 07:34.990
I think I know
just what this family needs.

07:37.330 --> 07:39.450
You know, Dan,
you really should stay home.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.910
Just take some time off.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.370
Learning the truth
about Lucifer, it's a lot.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.420
I've been there.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.800
I'm guessing you handled it better.
Or did you shoot him too?

07:47.880 --> 07:52.800
[scoffs] I didn't, but I did almost poison
him with the help of an evil priest.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.600
[laughs] I genuinely
can't tell if that's a joke or not.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.510
Take some time, Dan.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.850
Look, I just wanna work.

08:02.230 --> 08:06.110
You know? Hell, you're the one who was
kidnapped. You should take some time off.

08:06.190 --> 08:07.110
Touché.

08:08.730 --> 08:10.740
How are you doing, by the way?

08:10.820 --> 08:12.700
I noticed Lucifer's not here.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.160
Well, we-- we hit a snag,
and he's dealing with some things,

08:16.240 --> 08:18.740
and I may have rushed him a bit,

08:18.830 --> 08:22.910
so I'm giving him space,
but he'll figure it out.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.040
We're strong enough to get through this.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.670
Well, at least
Ella's taking some time off.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.880
[scoffs] Yeah.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.300
[Dan] Oh. Hey, Ella.

08:35.180 --> 08:38.180
Before you start, no, I am not going home.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.060
I need to focus on the case.

08:40.930 --> 08:41.810
Okay.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.480
Really?

08:46.150 --> 08:49.110
I had, like,
five pretty solid arguments ready.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.110
-I mean, if you wanna hear them--
-No, we're good.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.490
-We're good.
-What do we have?

08:52.570 --> 08:53.860
[Ella sighs]

08:55.780 --> 08:58.280
Vic was Chris Peterson.

08:58.370 --> 09:01.200
COD seems to be
blunt force trauma to the head.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.250
I think he hit his head on the cement,

09:03.330 --> 09:07.330
but it's kind of hard to tell,
thanks to his BBQ-ed bod.

09:07.420 --> 09:10.130
[exhales] Looks like someone
was trying to burn down the hole.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.000
Maybe Chris stepped in, tried to stop 'em?

09:12.090 --> 09:13.920
Yeah,
we found gasoline all over this place.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.630
Someone was trying
to burn down the entire Kingdom.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.050
Lucky for the owners, the cement
stopped the fire from spreading, but--

09:20.140 --> 09:21.850
Who was he? One of the workers?

09:21.930 --> 09:23.980
No, this place is family-owned,

09:24.060 --> 09:27.060
so the dad and the kids
all work here and run this place.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.480
And this was the youngest son.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.730
Any witnesses?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.900
No. But the three kids were here,
working after hours,

09:33.990 --> 09:37.660
but they say they didn't see
any struggle or hear any arguments.

09:37.740 --> 09:41.080
They just saw the fire,
rushed out, only to find…

09:41.160 --> 09:42.660
The body of their burned brother.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.580
Well, let's go talk to them, see if
any of them wanted their brother dead.

09:45.660 --> 09:48.370
Oh, way ahead of you.
I know exactly how to find the killer.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.710
-You do?
-[Ella] Hell, yeah.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.840
See, all you have to do
is introduce me to all of the suspects.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.300
And whichever one I'm most attracted to,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.720
bam, that's your killer.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.100
Ella.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.890
Hey, I'm at peace with it.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.480
If I've got a broken picker, might as well
use it for the greater good, right?

10:20.700 --> 10:23.740
What are you gonna say to her?
Something romantic?

10:25.040 --> 10:27.000
You have that look on your face.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.710
Well, not anymore.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.880
What do you care?

10:31.960 --> 10:35.340
Why even ask? You're all-knowing,
don't you already know the answer?

10:35.420 --> 10:38.590
Hmm. Father's intuition.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.050
Well, intuit yourself somewhere else.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.470
Actually, no.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.260
Why are you still here?

10:44.350 --> 10:47.350
Isn't the universe gonna collapse
with your you-like powers on Earth?

10:48.230 --> 10:49.350
Hmm.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.030
-[ball rattles in cup]
-[bell tolling]

10:56.110 --> 10:58.110
[sighs]

10:59.570 --> 11:01.280
-It's fine.
-Is it?

11:01.360 --> 11:04.490
Well, as always, thanks for clearing
that up. Now, if you don't mind…

11:07.200 --> 11:08.870
I've come to ask you something.

11:12.830 --> 11:13.920
Well, go on, then.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.920
I'd like you to join me.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.380
For a family dinner.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.340
[laughs] Yeah?

11:22.090 --> 11:22.930
No.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.680
Pass. Hard pass.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.600
[God] Son.

11:27.810 --> 11:30.180
I don't wanna
leave Earth until we've all talked.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.310
Well, enjoy your eternity here, then,

11:33.400 --> 11:35.940
because there is absolutely no way

11:36.020 --> 11:40.650
I am sitting down for anything
as absurd or torturous as a family dinner.

11:40.740 --> 11:42.990
I've already done my time in Hell.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.070
Remember?

11:49.450 --> 11:52.210
[exhales] Good morning.

11:52.290 --> 11:55.130
Lucifer. I thought you needed space.

11:55.210 --> 11:59.000
Nope, no space needed. I'm right where
I need to be. So, where's the family?

11:59.090 --> 12:01.800
Well, the siblings are over there,
but how did you know--

12:01.880 --> 12:03.550
One of them is obviously the killer.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.600
He doesn't even know what the crime is.

12:09.470 --> 12:13.640
No, he's probably just
projecting his latest issues.

12:15.310 --> 12:18.440
-He's projecting his latest issues.
-What, and that's a good thing?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.740
He thinks it's the family. I--

12:20.820 --> 12:24.110
I thought he was upset with me
for rushing him, but he's not. He--

12:25.950 --> 12:27.990
He's mad at his own family.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.120
Of course.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.620
I should have stayed home.

12:44.130 --> 12:47.220
The Kingdom was built
from the ground up by our father.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.850
Everyone in the family
has a role in keeping the place running,

12:50.930 --> 12:54.980
but Chris, he never settled into his role.

12:55.060 --> 13:00.020
In-- In fact, he-- he left
a few years back to work for himself.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.650
So, what you're saying is

13:02.740 --> 13:05.700
the wayward son rebelled
against the family, forged his own path,

13:05.780 --> 13:06.910
and then you killed him.

13:06.990 --> 13:09.410
What? We-- we would never.

13:09.490 --> 13:12.500
We were all still close,
even though Chris left.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.920
And look, he died protecting it. He…

13:17.170 --> 13:18.210
he died a hero.

13:18.790 --> 13:21.500
Do any of you know anyone
who'd wanna burn the place down?

13:21.590 --> 13:23.130
Yeah, Juan Perez.

13:23.210 --> 13:24.130
And who's Juan?

13:24.220 --> 13:27.050
He is the owner of Hole in Juan.

13:27.130 --> 13:29.510
[laughs] See what he did there?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.640

25:14.220 --> 25:17.470
-We should arrest them for that lie alone.
-We heard otherwise.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.510
You have?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.640
Uh, from who?

25:20.720 --> 25:23.850
-Hmm. [clicks tongue]
-Was it Larry? Of course it was.

25:23.930 --> 25:26.480
Did Ted tell you
that I have a problem with April?

25:26.560 --> 25:30.230
Huh? Wait! They're both liars.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.740
It wasn't enough for you to manipulate
your poor, misunderstood brother,

25:33.820 --> 25:36.530
you had to ruin his life as well?

25:36.610 --> 25:37.860
Ruin his life?

25:37.950 --> 25:41.080
Kill. He means kill… his life.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.370
-Well, I had nothing to do with it.
-No.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.450
I swear.

25:44.540 --> 25:48.120
So all three of you claim to have
been working the night of the murder.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.420
-So what were you doing?
-Maintenance.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.630
On the arcade games.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.130
Updating the books.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.670
Cleaning the toilets.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.590
And can your siblings corroborate that?

25:58.680 --> 25:59.640
Sure.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.140
I mean, I don't know if Ted will.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.310
He was gone a while.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.020
I wasn't there the entire night.

26:08.100 --> 26:12.570
I went out to the parking lot
to make out with my new girlfriend.

26:12.650 --> 26:15.150
Ugh. Have you seen Ted?

26:15.240 --> 26:18.200
-No one wants to smash that.
-[chuckles] Unless he's paying her.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.570
I wasn't paying!

26:19.660 --> 26:23.740
You should talk to April.
She disappeared for a while.

26:23.830 --> 26:26.120
She was "in the bathroom."

26:26.200 --> 26:29.870
I was smoking pot. Okay? It's the only way
I can deal with my brothers.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.000
Understandable.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.340
What did April do? Come in here and whine?

26:33.420 --> 26:36.670
You know,
Larry was always jealous of Chris.

26:37.170 --> 26:40.140
If either of those idiots did it,
it was him.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.060
Jealous. Looks like we found our Michael.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.640
Hmm. He seems
more like an Amenadiel to me.

26:46.730 --> 26:52.020
[sighs] Unless he's a Michael
pretending to be an Amenadiel.

26:53.150 --> 26:56.190
Michael never pretends to be Amenadiel.
They look nothing alike.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.110
No, I mean…

26:58.400 --> 27:00.320
[sighs] No, just, never mind.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.370
Look, I'm sorry, Detective.
I think I need a moment.

27:06.950 --> 27:09.160
Excuse us. Lucifer, I--

27:12.540 --> 27:13.670
[sighs]

27:16.050 --> 27:18.010
Listen, what if they're all Michaels?

27:18.090 --> 27:20.010
Look how quickly
they turned on each other.

27:20.090 --> 27:20.930
Perhaps.

27:21.760 --> 27:22.680
[Chloe sighs]

27:23.800 --> 27:25.680
What if they apologized to you?

27:26.310 --> 27:27.180
To me?

27:27.770 --> 27:28.770
I mean, to Chris.

27:28.850 --> 27:31.730
I don't understand.
What good is apologizing to a dead body?

27:31.810 --> 27:33.100
-[officer] Detective.
-Yes.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.900
I'm Peter Peterson, and I, um--

27:37.980 --> 27:40.860
Have the greatest name ever. [chuckles]

27:40.950 --> 27:42.450
I'm the father of--

27:42.530 --> 27:44.570
Chris Peterson, yes.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.160
So sorry for your loss.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.620
Thank you. But I'm afraid 
you're after the wrong suspects.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.120
Right.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.750
Well, with all due respect--

27:52.830 --> 27:54.830
I killed my son.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.710
And I can't let
another one of my children suffer

27:58.800 --> 28:00.260
because of my mistakes.

28:01.220 --> 28:04.970
I dropped by the, uh, Kingdom last night.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.890
I saw Chris take a gas can from the shed.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.890
I tried to stop him, of course,

28:11.480 --> 28:13.480
but we fought and--

28:13.560 --> 28:15.400
I mean, it was an accident, but…

28:17.150 --> 28:20.030
I killed my own son.

28:22.030 --> 28:22.900
I see.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.280
Well, thank you for that.
Would you please take his full statement?

28:27.370 --> 28:30.160
-I'll be with you in a minute.
-All right. I'm--

28:34.620 --> 28:35.460

28:36.540 --> 28:37.380
Are you okay?

28:39.800 --> 28:42.090
I am, Detective.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.260
You know, hearing that
confession felt great, actually,

28:46.340 --> 28:48.470
like exactly what I've been searching for.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.390

oceans and napkins

31:39.730 --> 31:42.230
and shoes and life.

-Thank you. Amen.

-Okay.

31:53.410 --> 31:54.240

32:52.670 --> 32:55.720
All it takes is
just the right amount of rosemary.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.260
You know,
I have to compliment you, Michael.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.850
At first, I thought
you exploiting poor Amenadiel's fears

33:01.930 --> 33:04.980
about Charlie's mortality
was just a-- a real shit move.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.190
[chuckles]

33:06.770 --> 33:09.820
And impersonating me, ravaging my life,

33:09.900 --> 33:11.570
convincing a friend to shoot me

33:11.650 --> 33:14.530
and kidnapping my girlfriend,
downright villainous.

33:14.610 --> 33:16.740
None of these sound like compliments.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.080
I started to wonder,
maybe there was an endgame.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.500
You create a mess
big enough to bring God himself down,

33:23.580 --> 33:25.250
we all regress in Dad's presence,

33:25.330 --> 33:27.290
noble Amenadiel takes the blame,

33:27.380 --> 33:30.000
rebellious Lucifer
runs off in a huff, leaving you…

33:31.300 --> 33:33.210
looking like the perfect son.

33:34.470 --> 33:39.010
But now, I realize it was just
to bring the family together for dinner.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.810
[chuckles]

33:40.890 --> 33:41.890
Pass the chicken.

33:44.430 --> 33:48.400
I know what you're trying to do, but
I'm not gonna let you ruin this, Samael.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.650
Very well, Mi-ka-el.

33:50.730 --> 33:53.440
-It's "Michael"!
-Is it?

33:53.530 --> 33:55.360
I mean, we're twins, after all.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.030
Fairly certain
Dad wanted them to rhyme. Dad?

33:58.110 --> 34:00.240
I did like the sound of that.

34:00.780 --> 34:03.870
Samael, Mi-ka-el. [chuckles]

34:03.950 --> 34:06.960
-But you boys had other ideas.
-[Amenadiel] Hmm.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.750
You know, I'm glad
you persuaded me to come, brother.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.760
Like you said, it's worth it,
even if Dad has been a real ass.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.260
[gulps, coughs]

34:17.260 --> 34:19.590
That's, um… [chuckles]

34:19.680 --> 34:21.970
That's actually not what I said.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.100
I was sympathizing
with my little brother, Dad,

34:25.180 --> 34:27.730
trying to, uh, get him to come to dinner.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.730
It's okay, son.

34:29.810 --> 34:30.810
Is it?

34:30.900 --> 34:31.940
And was he?

34:32.020 --> 34:35.990
[chuckles] Now think of what Amenadiel
went through the past couple of years.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.530
All that anguish,
thinking he'd fallen from your favor.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.280
He lost his wings, his very sense of self.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.450
Yeah, that's a bit dramatic.

34:42.530 --> 34:47.040
Only to discover that
he was doing it all to himself.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.710
Couldn't you have just
told us that's how we all work,

34:49.790 --> 34:52.710
instead of letting your favorite son
think he was being brutally punished,

34:52.790 --> 34:54.300
that he was a failure?

34:54.380 --> 34:57.050
-Lucy, come on.
-[chuckles] No, don't worry, brother.

34:57.130 --> 34:58.300
We're all being tortured.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.890
All in the name
of our father's mysterious ways.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.350
Ooh!

35:04.430 --> 35:06.270
For example, Dad…

35:07.270 --> 35:12.860
are you ever going to tell us why Hell
suddenly doesn't need a warden anymore?

35:21.610 --> 35:22.700
I have a good reason.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.490
Oh, it's a good reason.

35:25.580 --> 35:26.950
Well, that explains it.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.250
As always, super clear. Thanks, Pops.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.580
What are you even
complaining about, Lucifer?

35:31.670 --> 35:34.840
You got your own kingdom
as a reward for bad behavior.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.010
Is that how you see it?

35:42.220 --> 35:47.890
Being forced to torture souls for hundreds
of thousands of years was an "attaboy"?

35:48.930 --> 35:50.690
Sure, I was king of Hell,

35:50.770 --> 35:52.480
but I was still in Hell.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.860
If that's not a poisoned chalice,
I don't know what is.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.860
You have no idea what that was like,

35:58.940 --> 36:01.030
how easy you had it.

36:01.820 --> 36:02.700
Easy?

36:02.780 --> 36:03.820
[scoffs]

36:03.910 --> 36:06.870
I spent my entire life
in the worst kind of Hell there is.

-Lucy, Michael, come on.
-Oh, what could possibly be worse?

36:10.910 --> 36:13.120
Sharing a face with you!

36:17.710 --> 36:18.710
Guess what.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.050
When your twin is the light bringer,

36:21.130 --> 36:23.970
turns out you have no choice
but to live in the shadows.

36:24.050 --> 36:28.810
We were dealt the same hand,
the same face, the same bloody shoulders,

36:28.890 --> 36:32.390
except you had a chip on yours
so big you managed to self-actualize it.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.230
Oh, no, no, no, there's nothing
wrong with him, don't be fooled!

36:35.310 --> 36:38.570
You have no one to blame
but yourself for who you are.

36:38.650 --> 36:39.570
Lucy!

36:39.650 --> 36:41.280
Oh, I blame you plenty.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.570
-Michael!
-Of course you do, you petty little--

-Children!

37:20.980 --> 37:24.280
All I wanted was a nice family dinner.

No, Linda, we're sorry. That you
had to witness something like this.

No, it's just…

38:30.340 --> 38:33.930
three sons who want their father's love.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.270
And who don't feel
like they're getting it.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.440
I don't want Dad's love.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.860
I just want him to admit
to the fact that he's a bad father.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.400
Although…

38:49.740 --> 38:53.330
maybe that's part
of the reason he is a bad father.

38:53.410 --> 38:55.580
Well done, Doctor.
You're as insightful as ever.

38:55.660 --> 38:58.460
No, that wasn't exactly what
I was saying. [sighs] As usual--

38:58.540 --> 39:01.040
-You're really being unfair.
-Oh, come on, brother.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.420
Would you treat Charlie
the same way Dad's treated us?

39:04.500 --> 39:07.420
-Well, I--
-Be honest! Please.

39:13.970 --> 39:15.970
I'm sorry, Dad, but I hope not.

39:17.220 --> 39:20.100
And you'd do anything
for your son, wouldn't you?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.730
I would.

39:22.810 --> 39:24.980
[Lucifer] Michael and I
don't agree on much,

39:25.070 --> 39:28.900
but the one thing that we all
have in common is you, Dad.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.990
And how much you've screwed us up.

39:34.620 --> 39:37.160
I mean, if all the apples are bad…

39:38.910 --> 39:40.960
maybe it's the tree that's the problem.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.750
I'm sorry you feel that way.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.800
All I ever wanted was to empower you…

39:50.300 --> 39:51.550
all my children,

39:52.720 --> 39:54.260
to make your own choices.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.680
Is that why you've always been so cryptic?

39:56.760 --> 39:59.770
Oh. Before you answer that cryptically,

39:59.850 --> 40:04.400
I would like to instead
ask you one simple question

40:04.480 --> 40:07.530
and get one simple answer.

40:07.610 --> 40:09.990
A confession, if you will.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.240
Dad, you don't have to do this.

40:15.950 --> 40:17.660
What's your question, Samael?

40:24.080 --> 40:24.920
Dad…

40:26.880 --> 40:28.130
do you love us?

40:28.750 --> 40:30.760
[thunder crashing]

40:40.430 --> 40:41.810
If I have to tell you…

40:43.600 --> 40:45.350
then I really have failed.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.320
A no, then.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.280
-That's not what he said.
-[Lucifer] He didn't say yes, did he?

40:53.360 --> 40:55.530
When I don't wanna lie,
I don't answer the question.

40:55.610 --> 40:57.580
Picked that up from you, Dad.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.710
[scoffs, inhales deeply]

41:02.790 --> 41:04.670
You know, it's-- It's funny.

41:06.170 --> 41:08.670
I thought this moment
would give me some catharsis.

41:10.710 --> 41:14.380
But instead, it's just
made me realize one simple truth.

41:17.010 --> 41:18.930
That you will never love us…

41:20.560 --> 41:22.680
because you're incapable of love.

41:25.020 --> 41:26.900
-[huffs]
-[thunder crashes]

41:28.440 --> 41:29.690
And that's just sad.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.360
For all of us.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.320
[thunder rumbles]

41:46.710 --> 41:49.080
[door opens, closes]

41:56.220 --> 41:59.010
-More wine?
-[thunder crashes]

42:07.020 --> 42:09.440
[sighs] Hello, ladies.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.940
What exciting new case
are we investigating today?

42:14.400 --> 42:15.320
Hole in Juan?

42:15.400 --> 42:17.860
I don't understand. Peterson confessed.

42:17.950 --> 42:20.120
Yeah, his confession doesn't add up.

42:20.200 --> 42:23.450
Yeah, we found traces of ZX3
in the fuel that burned down the Kingdom.

42:23.540 --> 42:27.710
Oh! So whoever burned down
the Kingdom used gas from Hole in Juan.

42:27.790 --> 42:30.670
Yeah, but Peterson told us
he saw his son get gas from the shed.

42:30.750 --> 42:34.000
So he lied. Fathers do that. [chuckles]

42:34.090 --> 42:36.880
Well, we pulled surveillance footage
from the day before Chris died.

42:36.970 --> 42:38.340
[Ella] There's Chris.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.930
I mean, he does
look like he's applying for a job.

42:41.010 --> 42:44.640
-It tracks with what we know.
-Yeah, but something doesn't track.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.640
That looks like his girlfriend Betty.

42:47.730 --> 42:49.690
And she told us
she didn't know anything about it.

42:49.770 --> 42:52.060
Looks like Peterson
wasn't the only one lying.

42:52.150 --> 42:54.730
Right. We need to bring Betty in,
see what she's hiding.

42:54.820 --> 42:56.740
-We have to get Peterson back--
-Hey, guys.

42:56.820 --> 42:58.450
-[Chloe] Yeah.
-Peterson's running.

42:58.530 --> 43:00.490
-[Chloe] What?
-He bailed on house arrest.

43:00.570 --> 43:04.030
His ankle bracelet pinged in downtown
traffic. He's headed to Union Station.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.960
-If he's innocent, why is he running?
-Well, let's go and find out, shall we?

43:16.840 --> 43:17.720
So…

43:20.800 --> 43:22.800
-Charlie.
-Hmm.

43:25.220 --> 43:26.310
He's, um…

43:28.930 --> 43:30.980
He's mortal, isn't he?

43:32.480 --> 43:33.480
It appears so.

43:35.940 --> 43:38.240
So he'll suffer like all humans, Dad.

43:41.410 --> 43:42.870
Get sick.

43:45.910 --> 43:46.740
Grow old.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.250
Die.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.710
That would follow
from the fact that he's mortal.

44:00.550 --> 44:01.720
Take me instead.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.260
-Excuse me?
-I said…

44:05.100 --> 44:06.560
take me instead.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.020
Make Charlie an angel. I'll become human.

44:11.810 --> 44:12.900
Please, Father.

44:15.610 --> 44:17.570
Let me switch places with my son.

44:19.070 --> 44:20.780
You'd do anything for your son.

44:22.030 --> 44:22.950
Yes, anything.

44:23.530 --> 44:24.820
[sighs]

44:25.660 --> 44:28.080
If only fatherhood was ever that easy.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.950
-[scoffs]
-[door opens]

44:31.040 --> 44:33.710
[Michael] Good morning, brother.
Good morning, Father.

44:33.790 --> 44:36.670
Are you ready to go home?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Are you ready?

44:39.090 --> 44:42.340
[chuckles] Well,
I mean, I think it's time.

44:42.420 --> 44:44.550
Good. Then you should go.

44:45.390 --> 44:47.970
I've decided
to stay here a little bit longer.

44:48.970 --> 44:49.810
You have?

44:49.890 --> 44:52.180
Then I will stay with you.

44:52.270 --> 44:54.400
I don't think that would be a good idea.

44:55.190 --> 44:56.690
What…

44:56.770 --> 44:58.190
what are you saying, Father?

44:58.270 --> 44:59.230
Michael…

45:00.730 --> 45:02.610
you're no longer welcome on Earth.

45:04.820 --> 45:08.330
[gasps, huffs]

45:08.410 --> 45:09.540
You're banishing him?

45:09.620 --> 45:12.960
-If you insist on putting it that way.
-But I-- I don't understand.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.120
Why am I the one being punished?

45:15.830 --> 45:16.880
You're not.

45:17.460 --> 45:18.540
[huffs]

45:26.010 --> 45:28.010
[door opens, closes]

45:28.100 --> 45:28.930
You see?

45:30.180 --> 45:31.010
Never easy.

45:34.810 --> 45:36.230
You have a futon, right?

45:48.820 --> 45:50.030
[Lucifer] There he is.

46:07.050 --> 46:09.260
-There he is. There, there!
-[Chloe] Oh.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.430
-[Lucifer] Excuse me.
-[Chloe] Excuse us!

46:12.770 --> 46:14.020
[Lucifer] Excuse me.

46:15.770 --> 46:18.020
-Excuse me! Sorry, sorry.
-[Chloe] Excuse us.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.650
[sighs] He must have seen us.

46:22.730 --> 46:25.690
[shouting]

46:27.280 --> 46:29.160
LAPD. Put down the gun!

46:29.740 --> 46:32.410
[whimpering]

46:35.120 --> 46:37.870
You weren't running from us.
You were chasing her.

46:37.960 --> 46:38.790
Why?

46:38.870 --> 46:40.170
She killed my son.

46:40.250 --> 46:42.840
But you said you killed your son.
Make your mind up.

46:42.920 --> 46:43.960
I would never.

46:44.050 --> 46:46.970
I confessed because I thought
one of my children had done it.

46:47.550 --> 46:48.760
I'd already lost one.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.850
I couldn't bear to lose another.

46:51.930 --> 46:56.060
[scoffs] So you were willing to
sacrifice yourself for your own children?

46:56.140 --> 46:58.310
Of course. That's what fatherhood is.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.690
You see, when I made bail,

47:02.400 --> 47:06.780
I talked to all my kids, and I
realized that none of them had done it.

47:06.860 --> 47:10.530
So then when I went to Betty
to talk to her, to see how she was doing…

47:10.610 --> 47:12.030
[panting]

47:12.120 --> 47:14.620
…and found she was skipping town,

47:15.410 --> 47:18.540
then suddenly, it all came into place.

47:18.620 --> 47:21.630
All I wanted to do
was burn that toxic place down.

47:21.710 --> 47:25.090
Everything that was broken in him
was because of it, because of you!

47:25.670 --> 47:27.210
He needed to get away.

47:30.430 --> 47:33.640
So you stole gas from Hole in Juan,

47:33.720 --> 47:36.100
and you tried to burn the place down?

47:36.930 --> 47:38.430
But Chris caught you, didn't he?

47:39.430 --> 47:42.770
[sniffles] We-- we struggled.

47:45.190 --> 47:47.110
He hit his head on the concrete.

47:49.950 --> 47:51.610
Before I could do anything…

47:53.320 --> 47:54.780
the fire was everywhere.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.580
It burned so fast. [shudders]

48:00.710 --> 48:02.330
My poor Chris.

48:03.960 --> 48:07.420
I swear I didn't mean
for any of this to happen. [sniffles]

48:08.510 --> 48:10.720
I'm sorry. [sobs]

48:13.140 --> 48:15.930
So my son died…

48:16.970 --> 48:18.720
protecting the Kingdom.

48:20.270 --> 48:22.520
Protecting us.

48:23.350 --> 48:26.820
It looks like
self-sacrifice runs in the family, eh?

48:28.070 --> 48:29.610
Apple, tree…

48:37.450 --> 48:38.490

48:38.580 --> 48:39.410
Right.

48:40.580 --> 48:41.460
Right.

49:03.230 --> 49:04.060

What?

you down and kick your ass is what.

Want a drink?

49:22.080 --> 49:23.210
No!

49:23.290 --> 49:26.630
What I want is a soul.
You promised me one, and I didn't get it.

49:26.710 --> 49:29.670
No, I promised you
an audience with my father,

49:29.750 --> 49:32.130
the one being who could give you a soul.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.630
That's all.

49:35.380 --> 49:37.390
[sighs]

49:37.470 --> 49:40.060
[scoffs] Frustrating, isn't he?

49:40.890 --> 49:44.390
What annoyingly arbitrary
and inscrutable answer did he give you?

49:48.860 --> 49:50.440
That I'm perfect.

49:51.230 --> 49:52.820
Just the way I am.

49:52.900 --> 49:54.360
Ugh.

49:56.950 --> 49:58.200
[sighs]

50:00.160 --> 50:01.950
You wanted me to find you.

50:02.620 --> 50:03.450
Why?

50:03.540 --> 50:05.960
Because I'm leaving town.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.130
And? You wanted to say goodbye?

50:10.790 --> 50:13.420
I guess out of all
the wretched beings I've met,

50:13.510 --> 50:16.050
I don't entirely hate you.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.930
And for what it's worth, Mazikeen,

50:20.010 --> 50:22.260
I'm sorry you didn't get what you wanted.

50:25.060 --> 50:27.940
[sighs] I'm sorry you didn't either.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.610
Doesn't mean I won't.

50:32.820 --> 50:33.820
What does that mean?

50:34.530 --> 50:36.530
That it ain't over till it's over.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.490
-For either of us.

Hey.

51:14.900 --> 51:15.780
Hello.

51:16.400 --> 51:19.780
Do you remember
when I said that it might be useful

51:19.860 --> 51:24.580
to draw a parallel between
your emotions and the case?

51:25.450 --> 51:26.410
Yes.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.540
So it turns out

51:27.620 --> 51:32.710
our killer was an overbearing
girlfriend trying to change her boyfriend

51:32.790 --> 51:36.130
because he couldn't deal
with his family issues.

51:36.210 --> 51:38.470
So, you know, no parallel.

51:38.550 --> 51:39.470
[both chuckle]

51:39.550 --> 51:40.550
Whatsoever.

51:40.630 --> 51:42.090
I think I was wrong.

51:42.180 --> 51:43.970
[sighs] Apparently so.

51:44.050 --> 51:45.260
[chuckles]

51:48.560 --> 51:50.560
Lucifer, I'm so sorry.

51:50.640 --> 51:54.060
You know, I was supposed to give you space

51:54.150 --> 51:55.940
so that you could
deal with your issues and--

51:56.020 --> 51:57.440
I didn't really help there, did I?

51:57.530 --> 52:03.120
No, but then I ended up
using the case to rush you anyhow.

52:03.200 --> 52:06.370
Detective, you have
been nothing but wonderful.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.870
And you…

52:13.000 --> 52:14.130

52:14.210 --> 52:16.750
…you deserve
to hear those three words back.

52:19.300 --> 52:22.090
But the truth is…

52:27.310 --> 52:29.520
I'll never be able to say them to you.

52:31.810 --> 52:33.520
I've realized that…

52:35.230 --> 52:37.400
I am my father's son.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.400
And as depressing as that is, it explains…

52:42.740 --> 52:43.610
so much.

52:45.450 --> 52:47.370
But it also means…

52:49.330 --> 52:50.750
like him, I…

52:53.710 --> 52:55.460
I am incapable of love.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.090

52:59.170 --> 53:01.550
You do. You know I always tell the truth.

[softly] Chloe, I am so sorry.
