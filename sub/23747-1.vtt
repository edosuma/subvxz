01:12.152 --> 01:14.851
Okay, now, all you kids
got a release form.

01:14.852 --> 01:17.118
You fill it out, you sign it,

01:17.119 --> 01:20.115
then you hand it over when
you get your official entry numbers.

01:20.452 --> 01:22.084
Only read it first.

01:22.085 --> 01:23.983
You break a leg, we fix it.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.451
You catch a cold,
there's free aspirin.

01:26.452 --> 01:29.448
But acts of God, the management
is strictly not to be held to account.

01:31.018 --> 01:34.014
Fire, flats, double pneumonia,
that's between you and Him.

01:35.084 --> 01:38.081
So read it and then sign.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.077
For the benefit of the first-timers,
we go around the clock,

02:36.412 --> 02:39.409
and around
and around and around.

02:39.612 --> 02:42.608
Ten-minute break
every two hours.

02:42.611 --> 02:45.608
Rollo!

03:22.176 --> 03:24.108
That's the warning signal.

03:24.109 --> 03:25.474
If it's your partner,

03:25.475 --> 03:28.472
you've got exactly 30 seconds
to get them moving again.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.407
No excuses, no explanations.

03:31.408 --> 03:33.274
Thirty seconds.

03:33.275 --> 03:36.272
If it's two knees -- Rollo.

03:40.974 --> 03:43.970
That's it, out.
O-U-T out.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.037
We're gonna run it
as fair as human nature allows,

03:48.107 --> 03:51.104
so when one of the judges rules,
that's it--no appeals.

03:53.074 --> 03:54.839
When your partner is ruled out,

03:54.840 --> 03:57.405
you can solo for 24 hours.

03:57.406 --> 04:00.205
If you match up
with another solo, fair enough.

04:00.206 --> 04:03.203
Otherwise, that's it -- out!

04:04.272 --> 04:07.269
There'll always be a trainer
or a nurse on duty,

04:07.439 --> 04:10.004
and a doctor out here
24 hours a day.

04:10.005 --> 04:11.937
Okay?

04:11.938 --> 04:13.271
Now, food.

04:13.272 --> 04:16.267
Four regular meals
and three small ones each day.

04:17.137 --> 04:20.134
Now!

04:20.603 --> 04:23.103
What the hell's going on over there?

04:23.104 --> 04:26.101
Sorry.

04:37.537 --> 04:40.102
Kid, fill this out and get over there.

04:40.103 --> 04:42.968
Come on, get over there.

04:42.969 --> 04:45.668
There'll be two judges
on the floor at all times,

04:45.669 --> 04:48.134
nurses and trainers
in the rest areas.

04:48.135 --> 04:51.034
Any questions,
come up and ask them.

04:51.035 --> 04:53.634
Fellas, give me a break.

04:53.635 --> 04:54.767
In a couple of hours,

04:54.768 --> 04:57.634
we fling open the magic doors
of fame and fortune,

04:57.635 --> 05:00.632
so line up and get your number.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.898
Yeah, we'll take care of that,
don't worry.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.999
Where do you want these, Rocky?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.132
They'll be here in a second.
Put them in there.

05:20.133 --> 05:23.129
Turkey, check the rest areas.

05:26.299 --> 05:29.296
Is this the first time
you've been in a contest?

05:35.365 --> 05:37.864
Some system.
Just like the fleet.

05:37.865 --> 05:40.730
Line up and wait, only longer.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.230
Hey! How about
goosin' it up a little?

05:43.231 --> 05:45.663
You'll get your turn.
Take it easy, huh?

05:45.664 --> 05:47.797
What's this stuff? Hooch?

05:47.798 --> 05:50.795
No, that's for my stomach.
I got a bad stomach.

05:58.264 --> 06:00.429
- Paregoric, opium base.
- No number.

06:00.430 --> 06:01.729
He's got another one.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.796
It's medicine.
I gotta take it for my stomach.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.295
So take it somewhere else. I got
enough trouble without a hophead.

06:06.296 --> 06:08.028
You heard him,
school's over. Blow.

06:08.029 --> 06:10.695
- That's no fair. Just because a guy's--
- Hire a lawyer.

06:10.696 --> 06:12.294
Come on. Next.
Move it up.

06:12.295 --> 06:15.292
Once, between hitches,
I worked a cattle boat out of Galveston.

06:15.762 --> 06:18.561
Same thing,
you know what I mean?

06:18.562 --> 06:21.558
No, I don't think I do, actually.

06:21.761 --> 06:24.758
Well, what I mean is, if you think about it,
cattle ain't got it much worse than us.

06:26.227 --> 06:27.960
They got it better.

06:27.961 --> 06:30.957
There's always
somebody feeding them.

06:32.227 --> 06:35.224
Sure. Stuffin' 'em up good
for the slaughter pen.

06:35.894 --> 06:38.225
Right down the chute
and some big dumb bohunk

06:38.226 --> 06:41.223
is standing there
with a sledgehammer.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.693
But they don't know
it's gonna happen.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.690
That puts 'em
one up on us, don't it?

06:47.060 --> 06:50.057
Yeah, if you think of it that way.

06:51.626 --> 06:53.425
What's the matter with him?

06:53.426 --> 06:56.423
Nothing.

06:59.159 --> 07:01.824
Have you got a specialty
of some kind?

07:01.825 --> 07:04.822
I'm an actress.
Alice LeBlanc, from London.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.657
You got an act or a bit?
Let's see a little.

07:08.658 --> 07:11.654
Well, if you give us a few seconds,
we could work something up, okay?

07:21.290 --> 07:24.287
Yes, they told me
you were fools,

07:24.823 --> 07:27.820
but I was not to listen to your
fine words, nor trust your charity.

07:28.157 --> 07:29.955
Jesus Christ.

07:29.956 --> 07:32.952
You promised me my life,
but you lied!

07:33.022 --> 07:35.854
You think that life is nothing
but not being stone dead!

07:35.855 --> 07:36.921
Alice.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.888
That's great, I really mean it.
Shakespeare, huh?

07:39.889 --> 07:42.521
- It's from "St. Joan."
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

07:42.522 --> 07:44.788
Maybe it's too highbrow,
but don't worry,

07:44.789 --> 07:46.788
I'll set up something
just right for you.

07:46.789 --> 07:49.753
Next!

07:49.754 --> 07:52.751
Hey, Sailor.

07:54.454 --> 07:57.451
Rocky, look at this.

08:00.154 --> 08:01.986
Thirty-one?

08:01.987 --> 08:03.552
Yeah, 31.

08:03.553 --> 08:05.353
What do I need--
a note from my mother?

08:05.354 --> 08:07.452
It's your feet, Sailor.

08:07.453 --> 08:09.652
Next!

08:09.653 --> 08:12.650
Move it. Move it.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.751
Doc.

08:17.752 --> 08:20.749
- You sick or something?
- It's all right.

08:22.118 --> 08:24.618
Open up. Wider.

08:24.619 --> 08:25.984
Wider.

08:25.985 --> 08:27.584
What is this?
He's all right.

08:27.585 --> 08:28.717
Bronchitis, maybe.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.684
Yeah, maybe the Mongolian crud.

08:30.685 --> 08:32.251
No dice.
You infect the whole place,

08:32.251 --> 08:34.116
I got the health department on my back.

08:34.118 --> 08:35.482
That's the way it is.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.250
Next!

08:37.251 --> 08:39.450
- I'm sorry, Gloria.
- That's a big help.

08:39.451 --> 08:42.448
- You're the one that talked me into this.
- I'm sorry.

08:45.217 --> 08:46.282
What about me?

08:46.283 --> 08:48.449
- I'm sorry.
- That's what he said.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.115
I can't buy coffee
and cigarettes with it.

08:50.116 --> 08:51.482
I can't make exceptions.

08:51.483 --> 08:54.249
- How many you got?
- 71 going through and I'm holding out...

08:54.250 --> 08:55.548
What about her?

08:55.549 --> 08:57.348
If she ain't pregnant, I'm Nelson Eddy.

08:57.349 --> 08:59.049
So, what's healthier than having a kid?

08:59.050 --> 09:01.448
And it gives the audience
something to root for.

09:01.449 --> 09:04.446
What do you want me to do--
run out and get knocked up?

09:05.349 --> 09:07.415
We could discuss it later.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.747
That soap's a little hard.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.380
- Is this our number?
- Just hold on a second.

09:10.381 --> 09:13.247
- You got any other suggestions?
- Get yourself another partner.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.245
Yeah, where?

09:21.248 --> 09:24.244
Hey, cowboy!

09:27.080 --> 09:30.077
Yeah, you!
Come here.

09:31.414 --> 09:33.712
Good luck, Bates.

09:33.713 --> 09:36.645
Keep the line moving.

09:36.646 --> 09:38.612
Look, I was just out walking.
I didn't come to--

09:38.613 --> 09:39.779
Is that a fact?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.278
What's your name, cowboy?

09:41.279 --> 09:43.045
Robert. Robert Siverton.

09:43.046 --> 09:44.678
In a minute!

09:44.679 --> 09:46.245
You got a partner, Richard?

09:46.246 --> 09:48.511
No, I--It's Robert.

09:48.512 --> 09:50.277
- I was just walkin'.
- There you are, miss.

09:50.278 --> 09:51.744
How's he gonna dance in those things?

09:51.745 --> 09:54.177
You mean boots?
They're not mine.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.177
I room with another guy.
He went away and left them behind.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.910
- He's gonna break an arch.
- Dig him up a pair of shoes.

09:58.911 --> 10:01.908
Or maybe you'd rather wait
for the Prince of Wales.

10:03.045 --> 10:06.041
- Have I got a choice?
- Yeah. Take it or leave it.

10:16.044 --> 10:18.142
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

10:18.143 --> 10:21.140
Welcome to the dance of destiny,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:22.243 --> 10:25.240
Around and around and around we go,
and we're only beginning, folks.

10:26.409 --> 10:28.042
Only beginning!

10:28.043 --> 10:31.039
On and on and on and on
and when will it stop?

10:31.909 --> 10:33.474
When will it end?

10:33.475 --> 10:34.807
When?

10:34.808 --> 10:37.805
Only when the last two of these
wonderful, starry-eyed kids are left.

10:39.941 --> 10:42.938
Only when the last two dancers
stagger and sway,

10:44.107 --> 10:47.104
stumble and swoon, across the sea
of defeat and despair to victory.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.038
One couple, and only one,
will waltz out of here,

10:53.940 --> 10:56.873
over broken bodies
and broken dreams,

10:56.874 --> 10:59.870
carrying the grand prize
of 1,500 silver dollars.

11:02.206 --> 11:04.438
Mr. Lightman!

11:04.439 --> 11:06.872
The clock of fate,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:06.873 --> 11:09.870
I said "the prize"
because only one couple

11:10.706 --> 11:13.271
will dance on
to fame and fortune.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.604
Those who give up,
those who give out,

11:15.605 --> 11:17.771
those who give in--out!

11:17.772 --> 11:20.769
Tough rules,
but these are tough times.

11:21.072 --> 11:24.068
In the words of our great leader,
Herbert Hoover,

11:24.071 --> 11:26.936
"Prosperity is
just around the corner."

11:26.937 --> 11:29.836
But what do we say
about the Depression?

11:29.837 --> 11:31.970
That's what we say
about the Depression.

11:31.971 --> 11:33.670
Come on,
let's hear it, folks!

11:33.671 --> 11:36.668
Let's hear it!

11:40.237 --> 11:42.102
It's walking dead night, Turkey.

11:42.103 --> 11:45.100
Pour me a shot of water.

11:55.535 --> 11:57.434
So pick your couple, folks.

11:57.435 --> 12:00.432
Struggle with 'em,
hope with 'em, pray with 'em.

12:00.435 --> 12:03.432
See if you can pick out that one lucky couple
and then cheer them on.

12:03.801 --> 12:06.034
Come on, let 'em
hear you care, folks.

12:06.035 --> 12:09.032
Let 'em know
you're with them all the way!

12:10.934 --> 12:12.233
You hear that, kids?

12:12.234 --> 12:15.231
You hear those wonderful folks
out there rooting for you?

12:15.367 --> 12:17.566
Come on, kids,
show them you care.

12:17.567 --> 12:20.563
A little... a little sprint for those
wonderful folks out there!

12:23.667 --> 12:26.232
That's it.
You see 'em give, folks?

12:26.233 --> 12:29.230
You see 'em give?
That's the spirit!

12:42.666 --> 12:44.830
So why California?

12:44.831 --> 12:47.530
You don't freeze
while you're starving.

12:47.531 --> 12:49.097
It has the movies.

12:49.098 --> 12:51.864
Are you an actress?

12:51.865 --> 12:54.263
I done four atmosphere bits
since I've been here.

12:54.264 --> 12:57.261
I'd have done more,
but I can't get into Central Casting.

12:57.464 --> 12:59.030
They got it all sewed up.

12:59.031 --> 13:01.596
Don't you know anyone
who can help you?

13:01.597 --> 13:03.929
In this business?
How can you tell who can help you?

13:03.930 --> 13:06.926
One day you're an electrician,
the next day you're a producer.

13:07.697 --> 13:10.693
The only way I could get near a big shot
is to jump on the running board of his car.

13:12.496 --> 13:15.493
God. Check that one.

13:18.663 --> 13:21.659
Anyway, I don't know if the men stars can
help me as much as the women stars.

13:22.462 --> 13:23.861
From what I've been seeing lately,

13:23.862 --> 13:26.859
I think I've been letting
the wrong sex try to make me.

13:27.795 --> 13:30.792
- You in movies, too?
- Sort of.

13:31.128 --> 13:34.125
I was a dead French villager
in "Fallen Angels."

13:37.228 --> 13:40.224
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!

13:45.193 --> 13:46.859
Wasting your time, kiddo.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.825
The only thing casting
is Von Sternberg's "Raw Earth."

13:49.826 --> 13:52.823
Strictly an all peasant talkie.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.392
I could play a peasant.

13:55.393 --> 13:58.390
Not in that thing you couldn't.

13:58.859 --> 14:01.856
- Do you like it?
- Does it matter?

14:02.558 --> 14:04.424
Not so long as they do.

14:04.425 --> 14:07.422
Hey, sweetie.
Got another partner, huh?

14:09.525 --> 14:12.391
Only he don't look
much healthier than the last one.

14:12.392 --> 14:13.690
What are you, a doctor?

14:13.691 --> 14:15.523
He don't mean nothin', honey.

14:15.524 --> 14:18.356
Just trying to be helpful.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.156
Cod liver oil.
You oughta take some, maybe.

14:21.157 --> 14:24.154
He's just steamin'
because you got 20 years on him.

14:24.624 --> 14:26.622
Maybe more like 30.

14:26.623 --> 14:29.256
That's where you got
your signals mixed up, sweetie.

14:29.257 --> 14:32.023
Yeah, experience--
that's what counts.

14:32.024 --> 14:35.020
Keep your eyes open, buster.

14:39.056 --> 14:42.053
Pick up the beat
and try to stay with me, will ya?

14:47.088 --> 14:50.085
Stop-time!

15:04.887 --> 15:07.884
That's the kind of contestants
we've got for you, folks.

15:09.353 --> 15:10.919
Very classy, Sailor.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.953
You musta killed them in Roseland.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.950
How about a big hand
for our very own ancient mariner?

15:16.819 --> 15:18.885
Harry Klein!

15:18.886 --> 15:21.883
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.

15:24.319 --> 15:27.316
Thank you, folks.
That's very generous.

15:28.985 --> 15:31.982
You could all see that Harry
used to be in the U.S. Navy.

15:33.485 --> 15:35.717
But something you can't see--

15:35.718 --> 15:38.715
I'd like to be serious for a moment,
folks, if you'll permit me.

15:39.218 --> 15:42.215
Harry Klein is one
of those brave young men

15:42.285 --> 15:45.282
who sailed off to beat the Kaiser.

15:45.450 --> 15:47.983
That's right,
a veteran of the Great War.

15:47.984 --> 15:50.981
And let's hope
there'll never be another.

15:53.017 --> 15:56.014
Harry was decorated in that war
for wounds received in action,

15:59.449 --> 16:02.382
but that's not all.

16:02.383 --> 16:05.048
I know Harry wouldn't want me
to tell you this,

16:05.049 --> 16:08.046
but right now, at this moment,
there are 32 pieces of shrapnel

16:10.249 --> 16:12.048
still embedded in Harry's body.

16:12.049 --> 16:13.148
Thirty-two!

16:13.149 --> 16:16.145
And here he is fighting another
kind of war and fighting to win.

16:17.415 --> 16:20.412
Isn't that the kind of grit
and never-say-die spirit

16:20.415 --> 16:22.247
that's made this a great country?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.214
It is, isn't it?
You bet it is!

16:24.215 --> 16:27.211
And I really mean that sincerely,
folks, from the bottom of my heart.

16:33.180 --> 16:36.177
I should've learned
how to tap dance.

16:39.546 --> 16:41.979
You okay?

16:41.980 --> 16:44.976
Hope I don't start lugging' on ya.

16:45.746 --> 16:48.212
You ain't never lugged on me.

16:48.213 --> 16:51.210
Just keep thinkin' about the seven meals
a day they gonna be feeding us.

16:52.646 --> 16:54.478
Can you feel that?

16:54.479 --> 16:56.845
- What?
- The ocean.

16:56.846 --> 16:59.842
The waves--you can feel them
right through the floor.

17:00.178 --> 17:03.175
Even when you're far from it,
you can still feel it sometimes.

17:03.511 --> 17:04.710
Not where I'm from.

17:04.711 --> 17:07.708
- Where's that?
- Around.

17:08.578 --> 17:10.943
Kansas.
Texas mostly--Dallas.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.577
That must've been nice.

17:12.578 --> 17:14.976
Nice?

17:14.977 --> 17:17.175
Well, I've never actually been through there,

17:17.176 --> 17:19.576
but that's the way
it always seemed to me.

17:19.577 --> 17:22.376
You know, like you could look
just about anywhere and see land.

17:22.377 --> 17:24.476
I mean,
with nothing set down on it.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.108
Yeah, it's great.

17:26.109 --> 17:29.107
I'm a real sucker for dirt and cactus.
That's how come I left.

17:31.143 --> 17:34.108
Well, why did you leave?

17:34.109 --> 17:37.106
You ever been to bed
with a Syrian who chewed tobacco?

17:37.576 --> 17:40.572
Well, if anybody ever asks you,
tell 'em there's no future in it.

17:40.775 --> 17:42.440
What do you want--
the whole floor?

17:42.441 --> 17:44.008
I'm terribly sorry.

17:44.009 --> 17:47.005
The way she's throwing it around,
her feet will last longer than her rear end.

17:49.841 --> 17:52.506
He was a butcher.

17:52.507 --> 17:55.504
- Who was?
- The Syrian.

17:56.574 --> 17:59.139
Listen, I didn't mean to be personal.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.137
I was just--
I didn't mean to be personal.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.406
Yeah? Then why'd you ask?

18:04.407 --> 18:07.206
Well...
just to make conversation.

18:07.207 --> 18:09.072
We're gonna be stuck together
for a long time--

18:09.073 --> 18:12.069
Don't strain anything for me.

18:14.373 --> 18:15.605
All right.

18:15.606 --> 18:18.537
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.
This is Novelty Night.

18:18.538 --> 18:21.337
We've got a husband and wife
dancing together.

18:21.338 --> 18:24.335
Mr. and Mrs. Ora McCusick Mary
from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.437
There's a couple from Alaska.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.703
Remember,
there's no place like Nome.

18:30.704 --> 18:32.937
Don't forget to write
your poor old mother.

18:32.938 --> 18:35.503
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah.

18:35.504 --> 18:38.501
All right, kiddies, it's opening night.
Smile for the audience.

18:39.471 --> 18:42.468
- What audience?
- We'll worry about that.

18:45.603 --> 18:48.600
He could get you disqualified.

18:49.370 --> 18:52.367
I've been disqualified by experts.

18:56.036 --> 18:58.202
Ten minutes
and then they'll be back,

18:58.203 --> 19:01.199
and the world's championship
marathon will go on and on

19:01.769 --> 19:04.766
and on and on and on!

19:07.768 --> 19:09.834
I got no time
for personal problems.

19:09.835 --> 19:12.832
Just go find a bed.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.197
Chances are you'll probably
never see the things again.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.497
Laundry bag here,
towels and soap in there.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.565
It's very simple.

19:35.566 --> 19:38.298
Keep it in mind--
the laundry bag stays in here,

19:38.299 --> 19:41.296
towels and soap
in that room only.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.896
Excuse me, girls.

20:07.897 --> 20:10.762
Miss LeBlanc, you got
that specialty bit down yet?

20:10.763 --> 20:13.760
I'm memorizing it now.
Every line.

20:14.663 --> 20:17.660
Swell. Come by my office next break.
Maybe we'll run through it.

20:38.928 --> 20:41.925
Better get off your feet.

20:47.527 --> 20:50.524
When's the baby due?

20:50.693 --> 20:52.659
Don't know.

20:52.660 --> 20:55.657
What'd the doctor say?

20:57.426 --> 21:00.423
Well, see, James and me
been hitchin', ridin' in boxcars.

21:06.592 --> 21:09.157
Nature's little miracle.

21:09.158 --> 21:12.155
Christ.

21:12.459 --> 21:13.924
- Why--
- What's the use of having a kid

21:13.925 --> 21:15.790
unless you got enough dough
to take care of it?

21:15.791 --> 21:18.788
You better get off your feet.
You only got another five minutes.

21:21.992 --> 21:24.988
Folks can't stop having babies
'cause they don't got no money.

21:26.057 --> 21:29.054
You intend to keep it?

21:29.590 --> 21:32.223
I could never get...

21:32.224 --> 21:35.220
Jimmy wants the baby.

21:35.223 --> 21:38.220
Yeah. Why not drop
another sucker into this mess?

21:39.357 --> 21:41.222
I told you guys,
no roughhousing.

21:41.223 --> 21:43.322
And no grab-ass there,
college kid.

21:43.323 --> 21:45.222
What's the matter there, boy?

21:45.223 --> 21:48.219
This ain't for me.
I got sensitive feet.

21:48.923 --> 21:51.919
Next time, I think
I'm gonna try flagpole sitting.

21:52.189 --> 21:55.186
You guys are crazy.

21:55.222 --> 21:56.388
That's really pitiful.

21:56.389 --> 21:59.385
Man can't even make it
to the first rest period.

22:00.588 --> 22:03.354
This here's
my eighth marathon already.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.352
My wife and I even won one
in Oklahoma City one time.

22:06.988 --> 22:09.985
We went 1,253 hours
of continuous motion.

22:14.754 --> 22:17.720
First one of these, kid?

22:17.721 --> 22:20.717
- How're you doing?
- I'm fine, doctor.

22:22.453 --> 22:24.685
It ain't first cabin.

22:24.686 --> 22:27.683
Hell, it ain't even steerage,
but it's better than nothin'.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.916
Well, I figured I wasn't doing anything else
real important, so here I am.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.851
You know what I'd do
if I was your age?

22:34.852 --> 22:37.849
I'd join up all over again--the fleet.

22:38.285 --> 22:39.784
No, I don't think I'd like that.

22:39.785 --> 22:42.782
I'd like to be able to move on
if I got bored or something, you know?

22:42.884 --> 22:45.881
Bumming?
That's all right for a while.

22:46.651 --> 22:49.648
But a man's gotta belong somewhere.
You know, be part of something.

22:50.918 --> 22:53.915
I mean, that's human nature, right?

22:55.317 --> 22:57.416
I guess I never really thought about it much.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.882
Yeah, well, you will.

22:58.883 --> 23:00.782
When you get
to be my age, you will.

23:00.783 --> 23:03.780
Not that I'm that old, you know.

23:05.783 --> 23:08.682
It's the muscles up here that count, kid.

23:08.683 --> 23:10.415
Even more so than your legs.

23:10.416 --> 23:13.413
Right up in there.

24:44.709 --> 24:47.706
No, you wait for Diane Nico,
she wait for you.

24:49.342 --> 24:52.339
The petals of many flowers will fall,
but Diane Nico will wait forever.

24:54.008 --> 24:57.005
Alice, that is terrible.

24:58.674 --> 25:01.139
It just doesn't suit me.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.306
I'll ask Mr. Graverto find
something else for us.

25:03.307 --> 25:04.607
I think you'd better.

25:04.608 --> 25:07.604
Hey, hot lips
Get that in Paris?

25:07.907 --> 25:10.672
No. My mother made it for me.

25:10.673 --> 25:13.670
Do you like it?

25:15.373 --> 25:18.370
It's very nice.

25:30.005 --> 25:33.002
Somebody said after the first hundred hours,
you start getting used to this.

25:33.005 --> 25:34.470
What are you looking at?

25:34.471 --> 25:36.870
There's a partially broken
window up there someplace.

25:36.871 --> 25:39.570
I was trying to see
if it was light out yet.

25:39.571 --> 25:42.070
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- Yeah, I know.

25:42.071 --> 25:45.068
Sometimes, down by the beach,
it gets light by 4:00.

25:45.171 --> 25:48.168
It's like that in Hawaii,
because it's an island, you know.

25:49.270 --> 25:50.402
Yeah, I know.

25:50.403 --> 25:53.400
Yeah. You can look right out
across the ocean to where the light is.

25:53.870 --> 25:56.269
You can even stand in one spot
and watch the sun come up

25:56.270 --> 25:59.267
on one side of the world
and go down on the other side.

25:59.669 --> 26:01.835
How'd you get out there--Hawaii?

26:01.836 --> 26:04.833
I've never been there, actually,
but you can imagine what it's like.

26:06.736 --> 26:09.732
Yeah, you can imagine
you're Gary Cooper, too, I suppose.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.534
I didn't mean that at all.

26:11.535 --> 26:13.767
Why are you always trying
to start an argument?

26:13.768 --> 26:14.801
All I meant was--

26:14.802 --> 26:17.100
You tell that twist
to lay off of my wife.

26:17.101 --> 26:18.267
She was at it again.

26:18.268 --> 26:21.265
Every rest period, she's on her all the time
about why don't she have it cut out,

26:21.668 --> 26:22.967
why don't she get rid of it.

26:22.968 --> 26:24.367
She's giving Ruby the jumps.

26:24.368 --> 26:26.533
I ain't having my wife
upset by no tramp like her.

26:26.534 --> 26:28.766
- Go to hell, you big ape!
- You--

26:28.767 --> 26:31.764
Don't.

26:33.067 --> 26:35.466
- Boy, next time, I'm gonna--
- Knock it off!

26:35.467 --> 26:37.565
You know the rules.
No fights on the floor.

26:37.566 --> 26:40.563
What do you think this is--
a joint or something?

26:44.099 --> 26:45.965
I'm keeping an eye on you.

26:45.966 --> 26:48.963
Which one?

27:02.564 --> 27:05.561
That was stupid. Did you see the face
on that corn pone? He coulda killed you.

27:07.431 --> 27:10.428
Yeah, I guess.

27:11.364 --> 27:14.361
Then why did you do it?

27:16.397 --> 27:19.393
'Cause you're my partner.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.592
How long we got left?

27:56.660 --> 27:59.657
Wouldn't you know it?
I got the curse coming on.

28:00.327 --> 28:03.324
Don't let them give you
any codeine. It'll pass you out.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.557
Around and around and around.

28:23.558 --> 28:26.324
Ninety-seven hours
of continuous motion.

28:26.325 --> 28:27.524
And look at them, folks.

28:27.525 --> 28:30.522
Still struggling, still hoping to win
the grand prize of 1,500 silver dollars

28:33.791 --> 28:36.788
Let's give these wonderful
courageous kids a great big hand, huh, folks?

28:39.057 --> 28:42.054
That's the spirit.

28:46.357 --> 28:49.353
You wanna sleep some?

28:50.456 --> 28:53.453
No, I'm too tired to sleep.

28:55.189 --> 28:58.186
Sailor says you gotta go
a long time, maybe 500 hours,

28:58.689 --> 29:01.686
before you can get so you can sleep
while you're still moving.

29:05.255 --> 29:08.252
- You look tired
- No kidding.

29:09.055 --> 29:12.052
Why don't you try sleeping
on my shoulder?

29:12.487 --> 29:15.484
I won't let you slip.
You can trust me.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.253
That's what the last guy said.

29:17.254 --> 29:20.251
- What?
- Forget it.

29:20.354 --> 29:23.351
Gloria?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.852
She's there again.

29:26.853 --> 29:29.850
She must live here.

29:31.053 --> 29:32.818
You really ought to be nice to her.

29:32.819 --> 29:35.118
Rollo told me she's trying
to get us a sponsor.

29:35.119 --> 29:36.618
Nobody asked her to.

29:36.619 --> 29:39.616
Look, it could mean four bucks a week,
clean socks, and new shoes.

29:40.485 --> 29:43.482
Come on.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.448
- I'm Mrs. Laydon.
- Yes, ma'am, we know.

29:51.451 --> 29:54.317
One of the floor judges told us
you're trying to get us a sponsor.

29:54.318 --> 29:56.717
That's 'cause
you're my favorite couple.

29:56.718 --> 29:59.714
You're wearing my number--67.

30:00.151 --> 30:02.616
That's the year I was born.

30:02.617 --> 30:05.614
Really?

30:09.450 --> 30:11.583
We're not supposed to stay
in one spot for too long.

30:11.584 --> 30:13.216
I understand.
You go along.

30:13.217 --> 30:15.748
But don't give up,
'cause you're going to win.

30:15.749 --> 30:18.746
- I know you are.
- Thank you

30:29.915 --> 30:32.314
You can't leave the floor.
I gotta eliminate you.

30:32.315 --> 30:35.312
Don't bother.

30:36.315 --> 30:38.480
Figure them two.

30:38.481 --> 30:41.477
They'll never know
what they missed.

30:44.148 --> 30:47.144
Why didn't you tell me
it was gonna be this tough?

30:48.247 --> 30:51.244
You're holding your knees too tight.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.277
It knots up the muscles.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.877
Sixty-five.

31:00.346 --> 31:03.343
I figured it out.
That's how old she is.

31:05.612 --> 31:08.111
God, I hope I never live
to be that old.

31:08.112 --> 31:11.108
That's not the way it happened.

31:12.712 --> 31:15.709
It wasn't like that.

31:18.045 --> 31:21.042
We were very close in a way.

31:23.277 --> 31:25.743
I was her friend

31:25.744 --> 31:27.943
Yowsah, yowsah!
Watch your feet, folks.

31:27.944 --> 31:29.610
It's all part of the show.

31:29.611 --> 31:32.009
Seven meals a day.
Seven--count 'em.

31:32.010 --> 31:35.007
Believe me, these boys and girls
can really put it away.

31:35.077 --> 31:37.009
- What's your name, my dear?
- Angie.

31:37.010 --> 31:39.209
- How are you enjoying the food?
- Very good.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.275
You hear that, folks?

31:40.276 --> 31:42.442
After four days
of continuous dancing,

31:42.443 --> 31:44.875
these boys and girls
may not be well-heeled,

31:44.876 --> 31:47.541
but you can bet
they're well-stuffed.

31:47.542 --> 31:49.975
Ten minute's time
is all they have to eat it in,

31:49.976 --> 31:52.972
and they must keep moving,
they must keep dancing at all times.

31:53.409 --> 31:56.406
- How are you doing, Sailor?
- I feel fine, the grub's good. I feel fine

31:57.841 --> 32:00.838
The food is prepared in our own kitchens
by our own culinary experts,

32:01.241 --> 32:03.340
at great expense
to the management,

32:03.341 --> 32:06.338
but they believe that these
boys and girls should be well-fed.

32:06.708 --> 32:09.273
Keep eating, kiddies.
Keep dancing.

32:09.274 --> 32:12.271
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

32:21.639 --> 32:24.471
I have to.

32:24.472 --> 32:27.469
Yeah...how are you gonna feed it
after you've got it?

32:51.771 --> 32:53.670
Couple number 65,

32:53.671 --> 32:56.668
in a scene direct from that
smash Broadway hit "Private Lives,"

32:59.237 --> 33:02.234
our own Ramon Novarro
and Jean Harlow--

33:03.570 --> 33:06.567
Mr. Joel Girard
and Miss Alice LeBlanc.

33:07.937 --> 33:09.635
Did they like us?
Did they?

33:09.636 --> 33:10.834
I hope so.

33:10.835 --> 33:12.668
Do you think there's anyone in?

33:12.669 --> 33:15.666
All the studio people.
Let's go look.

33:15.835 --> 33:17.734
Alice and Joel will be
back with us again,

33:17.735 --> 33:20.732
if there's no Hollywood talent scouts
in the audience tonight.

33:25.569 --> 33:28.565
And now, in keeping with our policy
of letting you folks know everything

33:28.634 --> 33:30.733
that happens in our little family here,

33:30.734 --> 33:33.731
I am pleased to inform you
that another sponsor's come forward

33:34.134 --> 33:36.766
to back still another pair
of our spunky kids.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.632
Couple number 67,

33:38.633 --> 33:41.630
Gloria Beatty and Robert Siverton!

33:42.934 --> 33:45.931
Let 'em see the company
that's backed you to win, kids.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.532
Congratulations, kids.
Congratulations.

33:49.533 --> 33:50.998
And who knows, folks?

33:50.999 --> 33:53.996
With a sponsor like that,
they may just win.

33:56.332 --> 33:59.329
Suppose we did win.
What would you do with it?

33:59.799 --> 34:02.795
- What? With what?
- The money.

34:05.065 --> 34:08.062
Maybe I'd buy
some good rat poison.

34:39.396 --> 34:41.994
What the hell is it?

34:41.995 --> 34:43.328
It's two hours.

34:43.329 --> 34:46.324
You told me to get you up
in two hours, Rocky.

34:55.328 --> 34:58.325
Shake me out a butt, Turkey.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.760
Listen to 'em...

35:04.761 --> 35:07.757
Those wonderful, wonderful people.

35:08.860 --> 35:11.857
Yowsah.

35:18.526 --> 35:21.523
Shut it.
Shut the goddamn door.

35:28.458 --> 35:31.324
Wonderful.

35:31.325 --> 35:34.322
You gotta understand them is all.

35:46.524 --> 35:49.520
You know something, Turkey?

35:51.223 --> 35:54.220
My old man never got out
of the fourth grade.

35:55.290 --> 35:58.287
When it came to people...

35:58.956 --> 36:01.953
...he didn't know his ass from his elbow.

36:03.322 --> 36:06.319
You know what he was?
He was a faith healer.

36:08.088 --> 36:11.085
I used to travel his circuit with him.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.254
I was the one he healed.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.252
I was his shill
to get the crowd set up.

36:18.388 --> 36:21.385
"Walk, my boy."

36:21.688 --> 36:24.684
"When I lay my hand on you,
you will walk."

36:25.454 --> 36:28.450
"You will walk."

36:32.820 --> 36:35.719
Sodden old bastard!

36:35.720 --> 36:38.716
He thought it was him
they believed in, but it was me.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.977
Here's a guy whose fingers
stretched over 13 notes.

39:20.973 --> 39:23.373
What are you doin' here?
It's a rest period.

39:23.374 --> 39:26.139
You're supposed to be
off your feet.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.039
I was just looking at the sunset.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.005
Go on, get off your feet.

39:32.006 --> 39:33.971
Okay.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.969
Sunset.

40:14.802 --> 40:17.799
Matron?

40:18.136 --> 40:21.132
Someone?

40:24.968 --> 40:27.601
It is gone.
Matron!

40:27.602 --> 40:29.334
- What is it?
- It's gone.

40:29.335 --> 40:31.700
- It's gone!
- What's gone?

40:31.701 --> 40:34.167
My dress!

40:34.168 --> 40:35.634
It's right in front of you

40:35.635 --> 40:37.734
No, my other one.
My pink one.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.733
I--

40:39.734 --> 40:41.900
And chemicals for my hair.

40:41.901 --> 40:44.898
My rouge!

40:45.433 --> 40:46.866
And my lipstick!

40:46.867 --> 40:48.699
Everything is gone!

40:48.700 --> 40:50.599
Somebody's taken it
out of my bag!

40:50.600 --> 40:53.596
Nobody's taken anything.
It's probably just slipped under here.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.398
No. They did it!

40:57.399 --> 40:58.632
One of them did it.

40:58.633 --> 41:01.630
- One of them stole my things!
- You stop!

41:01.633 --> 41:04.630
- Stop it right now.
- Give it!

41:05.399 --> 41:06.931
- Give it back to me!
- You heard it.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.731
You know what that means.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.564
What the hell's going on here?

41:10.565 --> 41:13.562
You heard the sirens. Come on!
Hurry up and get out there!

41:14.098 --> 41:15.797
My dress.
I had it in my case--

41:15.798 --> 41:17.830
- Is she squirrelly?
- I don't think so.

41:17.831 --> 41:19.930
- My pink satin one.
- You better shake it up.

41:19.931 --> 41:22.496
- You got a couple of seconds left.
- I only have two dresses.

41:22.497 --> 41:25.494
Later! Just hustle
your fanny out there

41:26.397 --> 41:29.394
Nobody wants your dress.

41:29.697 --> 41:31.929
Please wait.
Please wait.

41:31.930 --> 41:34.927
Why don't you wear
your other one?

41:38.997 --> 41:41.993
Please wait.

41:53.495 --> 41:56.492
- What?
- Nothing.

42:01.295 --> 42:03.393
What are they doing it for?

42:03.394 --> 42:06.391
It's not for fun.
You can bet on that.

42:10.494 --> 42:13.490
Christ. Here it comes.

42:19.326 --> 42:22.323
I can't.
Jimmy, I don't think I can.

42:22.959 --> 42:25.956
Yeah, you can, honey.
Just don't start thinking about it now.

42:33.992 --> 42:36.258
Son of a bitch.

42:36.259 --> 42:39.256
The thing to remember, kids, is this is
the kind of stunt that packs 'em in.

42:39.658 --> 42:42.590
Listen, we'll even get some
of the Hollywood crowd out there tonight.

42:42.591 --> 42:44.624
Get one of those uniforms
they're passing out

42:44.625 --> 42:47.290
and make sure
you tie your numbers on.

42:47.291 --> 42:50.288
Number 63, easy on the goods.

42:51.124 --> 42:54.121
Listen, kids, these track outfits are
being rented for one time, and one time only,

42:54.891 --> 42:57.887
so any rips, tears, or malicious damage,
you get charged, okay?

42:59.457 --> 43:01.356
We don't have enough
uniforms to go around,

43:01.357 --> 43:04.189
so the rest of you will wear
sweat suits, but they're very nice.

43:04.190 --> 43:06.622
We'll have the doctor
and the nurses on the floor,

43:06.623 --> 43:09.054
so no one has to worry.

43:09.055 --> 43:12.052
Now, you kids who are pros
already know how it works

43:13.089 --> 43:15.654
I'm sure the rest of you
have all heard about it.

43:15.655 --> 43:18.554
And now--now you're going to see it!

43:18.555 --> 43:21.552
Yowsah! The derby!

43:25.787 --> 43:28.784
The supreme--the supreme test
of energy and endurance.

43:30.754 --> 43:33.751
Ten solid, wrenching minutes
of rack and ruin--the derby!

43:39.387 --> 43:42.384
Good! Good, good, good, good.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.652
Because you're in
for an exciting extravaganza.

43:46.653 --> 43:48.018
Yowsah, the derby.

43:48.019 --> 43:51.016
And, if I may be permitted
to share a thought with you,

43:52.319 --> 43:54.684
there's a lesson for all of us
in this, ladies and gents

43:54.685 --> 43:57.682
Contestants,
if you hear me back there...

43:58.352 --> 44:00.217
...you don't need
to be number one

44:00.218 --> 44:02.917
as you amble down
life's highway....

44:02.918 --> 44:05.884
but don't be last!

44:05.885 --> 44:08.882
Round and round and round
they'll go for ten little minutes.

44:09.684 --> 44:12.517
Who will set the pace?
Who will win the race?

44:12.518 --> 44:15.515
Everybody excepting
the last three couples!

44:18.284 --> 44:21.281
- Let's go!
-And now, here they are!

44:45.781 --> 44:47.847
And lookyy, looky, looky, folks.

44:47.848 --> 44:49.780
They've got knees!

44:49.781 --> 44:52.778
They've got knees!

44:59.148 --> 45:00.313
Everybody here?

45:00.314 --> 45:03.310
Okay, take a good look!

45:04.614 --> 45:06.112
Get your hankies ready, folks,

45:06.113 --> 45:09.110
because three couples
are about to go bye-bye.

45:10.213 --> 45:13.210
Yes, indeed.

45:13.646 --> 45:16.512
Nurses and house physician,
are you ready?

45:16.513 --> 45:19.510
Audience, are you ready?

45:19.979 --> 45:22.976
All right! Bring it in!

45:36.744 --> 45:39.741
Mr. Rhythm!

46:19.741 --> 46:22.738
Yes. Yes, indeed, they are off,
ladies and gentlemen

46:23.341 --> 46:26.338
Everyone wins in this race,
except the last three couples.

46:27.274 --> 46:30.271
The supreme test
of energy and endurance.

46:30.740 --> 46:33.539
If one goes down,
they have ten seconds,

46:33.540 --> 46:36.537
and ten seconds only, to getup.

46:36.806 --> 46:38.671
And they must heel-and-toe.

46:38.672 --> 46:40.205
Hold your hats, folks.

46:40.206 --> 46:41.938
Here come the leaders.

46:41.939 --> 46:44.936
Four judges, keep your eyes
on the last three couples,

46:46.606 --> 46:49.603
because the last
three couples will lose

47:45.101 --> 47:48.098
Oh, nelly!
There's a pileup.

47:48.201 --> 47:50.999
There's a pileup
in the far corner!

47:51.000 --> 47:53.766
One! Two! Three!

47:53.767 --> 47:56.763
Four! Five! Six!

47:56.766 --> 47:59.763
Seven! Eight! Nine!

48:01.399 --> 48:04.396
How about that, folks?
Exciting? Well, I hope to tell you.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.865
You all right?

48:06.866 --> 48:08.065
Keep going!

48:08.066 --> 48:11.063
Come on. Come on.

48:21.432 --> 48:24.428
The management cautions
that no wagering is permitted,

48:26.065 --> 48:29.061
but you can always cheer on
your favorite couple,

48:29.231 --> 48:32.228
and believe me,
these wonderful kids deserve your cheers,

48:32.830 --> 48:35.827
because each one of them
is fighting down pain, exhaustion,

48:36.763 --> 48:39.562
weariness,
struggling to keep going,

48:39.563 --> 48:42.560
battling to win,
and isn't that the American way?

48:56.162 --> 48:57.994
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just been informed

48:57.995 --> 49:00.992
that among our celebrity guest list
for tonight is Mr. Mervyn LeRoy!

49:06.695 --> 49:08.527
You hear that? LeRoy.

49:08.528 --> 49:09.926
Who's LeRoy?

49:09.927 --> 49:12.060
Only the best director
in Hollywood!

49:12.061 --> 49:13.593
How about it, Mr. LeRoy?

49:13.594 --> 49:16.591
Almost as much excitement here
as in "Little Caesar", right?

49:27.960 --> 49:30.957
Heel-and-toe, Sailor, or she's out!

49:41.259 --> 49:44.255
Come on, we're almost there

49:49.824 --> 49:52.090
There's trouble right here, folks.

49:52.091 --> 49:54.890
The boy from couple
number 78 is in trouble.

49:54.891 --> 49:56.057
Get a floor judge over there.

49:56.058 --> 49:58.656
- One! Two!
- Get up!

49:58.657 --> 50:00.156
No, stop it!

50:00.157 --> 50:02.022
No! Get up!

50:02.023 --> 50:04.622
Three! Four!

50:04.623 --> 50:07.355
Five! Six!

50:07.356 --> 50:10.022
No! No! No!

50:10.023 --> 50:13.019
- Eight! Nine! Ten!
- Stop it!

50:13.823 --> 50:16.088
Out! Get him out!

50:16.089 --> 50:18.455
Couple number 78 is out!

50:18.456 --> 50:21.452
Out of the world's championship
monster marathon!

50:22.755 --> 50:25.752
But that's life!
Let's give them a big hand!

50:55.320 --> 50:58.317
Are you all right?

51:02.452 --> 51:05.449
- Are we behind?
- I don't know.

51:08.852 --> 51:11.849
Less than two minutes left,
ladies and gentlemen!

51:16.551 --> 51:19.548
- Go! Keep going!
- Only two minutes.

51:35.816 --> 51:37.949
What's the matter?

51:37.950 --> 51:40.248
Couple number 67
is in trouble, folks.

51:40.249 --> 51:43.246
No fooling, they're in trouble!

51:43.516 --> 51:46.513
The boy from 67 is down!
He is definitely down!

51:48.116 --> 51:51.113
- What is it?
- My leg.

51:53.315 --> 51:55.880
Stretch your leg out and move it!

51:55.881 --> 51:57.380
One!

51:57.381 --> 51:59.980
- Shake your leg!
- Two!

51:59.981 --> 52:02.047
Three!

52:02.048 --> 52:03.247
- Four!
- Straighten your leg.

52:03.248 --> 52:04.346
Five!

52:04.347 --> 52:05.580
Help me!

52:05.581 --> 52:08.012
Six! Seven!

52:08.013 --> 52:10.846
Shut up, goddamn it!
He's getting up!

52:10.847 --> 52:13.113
- I'm up!
- Hang on to me.

52:13.114 --> 52:15.612
The guy from couple 67 is up!

52:15.613 --> 52:17.679
But will they make it?
They've lost ground

52:17.680 --> 52:20.677
Forty seconds left.
Will they make it?

52:21.379 --> 52:22.445
Hold on to me!

52:22.446 --> 52:25.412
That was the greatest.
You've got real guts. I mean it.

52:25.413 --> 52:27.578
- Save your breath!
- I hope you make it, baby.

52:27.579 --> 52:30.576
Thirty seconds!

52:38.011 --> 52:41.008
Twenty seconds!

52:47.810 --> 52:50.807
Ten seconds!

52:53.077 --> 52:56.074
Five seconds!

53:18.508 --> 53:21.505
The losers are
couple number 22,

53:22.975 --> 53:25.971
28, and 37.

53:27.341 --> 53:30.338
We weren't last.
It's okay.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.573
I know it's
a sad moment for all of us,

53:33.574 --> 53:36.473
but those are the rules,
ladies and gentlemen

53:36.474 --> 53:39.471
But after 602 hours,

53:39.840 --> 53:42.837
25 days of continuous dancing,

53:43.207 --> 53:46.204
I think that these kids
deserve a big hand!

55:04.366 --> 55:07.363
Have you heard anything yet,
Mr. Graver?

55:07.966 --> 55:10.898
Don't worry about it, Alice.
I've reported it to the authorities.

55:10.899 --> 55:12.832
We should hear something soon.

55:12.833 --> 55:15.830
It can't just have disappeared.
I mean, somebody must've taken it.

55:17.833 --> 55:20.830
It's not just my dress.
It's my makeup and everything.

55:22.232 --> 55:25.229
I have nothing else.

55:28.485 --> 55:30.584
The doctor's decision is...

55:30.585 --> 55:33.582
Lillian Kramer stays on
in the marathon!

55:40.519 --> 55:43.516
The doctor assures me Lillian
just has a slight sinus headache.

55:51.286 --> 55:54.283
Headache.

55:54.486 --> 55:57.483
For all that quack knows, she's...
she's got a brain tumor.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.453
No, I don't think so.

56:03.454 --> 56:06.451
I'm not exactly sure, but I think
it's different with a brain tumor.

56:08.787 --> 56:11.784
Different symptoms.

56:12.020 --> 56:15.018
Yeah? How do you know?

56:16.021 --> 56:18.753
I saw it in a movie...

56:18.754 --> 56:21.751
...with Anita Louise
and Richard Cromwell.

56:23.988 --> 56:26.687
That's what she died of--
Anita Louise.

56:26.687 --> 56:29.685
A brain tumor,
but it was different.

56:30.788 --> 56:33.785
Everything just suddenly
got dim for her one day.

56:35.022 --> 56:38.019
Until finally, she couldn't see at all.

56:39.722 --> 56:42.719
She couldn't even see Richard Cromwell
when she kissed him good-bye.

56:46.589 --> 56:48.488
Yeah?

56:48.489 --> 56:51.221
Then what, she just died?

56:51.222 --> 56:53.121
Kind of.

56:53.122 --> 56:56.119
She just drifted off
listening to her favorite tune.

56:58.322 --> 57:01.319
And then she was dead.

57:00.000 --> 57:20.000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

57:03.456 --> 57:06.454
No pain or anything?

57:09.156 --> 57:12.153
They probably lied.

58:10.592 --> 58:13.590
Bobby?

58:19.627 --> 58:22.192
Come on, kid.
Come on.

58:22.193 --> 58:25.190
Come on, break's over.
Come on.

58:25.893 --> 58:28.890
- Tommy?
- Yeah, Sailor.

58:29.827 --> 58:32.824
Kid's sleeping.

58:34.594 --> 58:37.591
Frank, we got a dead one here.

58:40.294 --> 58:43.291
Give me that ammonia.

58:49.095 --> 58:51.361
- Do you know where you are?
- What?

58:51.362 --> 58:54.359
- Give him another dose.
- No!

58:54.561 --> 58:56.494
Leave him alone.

58:56.495 --> 58:58.628
Are you all right?

58:58.629 --> 59:01.626
Hang on to me.

59:10.996 --> 59:13.494
- You sure you can make it?
- He's gonna be okay now.

59:13.495 --> 59:15.794
- I asked him, not you!
- Sure.

59:15.795 --> 59:18.792
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

59:19.962 --> 59:22.959
Here.

59:42.130 --> 59:43.929
Just like in marriage, folks,

59:43.930 --> 59:46.928
these kids have got to get off
by themselves once in a while,

59:47.230 --> 59:49.096
but exhausted as they are,

59:49.097 --> 59:51.696
it's tougher to stay
on their feet alone,

59:51.697 --> 59:54.694
so keep your eyes on them,
because it may be all over soon

59:55.764 --> 59:58.761
for one of these brave,
struggling kids.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:03.597
Get your hot dogs!

01:00:03.598 --> 01:00:06.595
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!

01:00:07.598 --> 01:00:10.330
Red hots! Hot dogs!

01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:12.998
Get your hot dogs!

01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:15.764
Only a nickel!

01:00:15.765 --> 01:00:16.897
Five cents!

01:00:16.898 --> 01:00:19.895
Hot dogs!
Get your red hots!

01:01:51.169 --> 01:01:53.168
- What's the matter?
- Get 'em off me!

01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:54.435
- What?!
- Get 'em away!

01:01:54.436 --> 01:01:56.902
What?!
Matron! Nurse!

01:01:56.903 --> 01:01:59.036
- What's the matter?
- They're crawling all over me!

01:01:59.037 --> 01:02:00.802
- Get them off me!
- There's nothing--

01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:02.569
Help me, please.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.567
- They're crawling all over me!
- You're all right.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:09.067
- There is nothing wrong.
- Hold her down!

01:02:10.104 --> 01:02:12.869
- What's the matter with her?
- She's squirreling.

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:15.770
Hold her!

01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:18.768
Tell 'em to turn up the Victrola.

01:02:18.938 --> 01:02:20.670
Please help me!

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.436
That won't help her none.

01:02:22.437 --> 01:02:24.104
Shirl...

01:02:24.105 --> 01:02:27.070
They're crawling on me!

01:02:27.071 --> 01:02:29.870
Listen to me, Shirl.
Listen to me.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.703
They're crawling on me!

01:02:31.704 --> 01:02:33.037
Where are they? Tell me.

01:02:33.038 --> 01:02:35.704
Tell me where they are.
Here, on your arm?

01:02:35.705 --> 01:02:38.702
They're gone.
Here, on your shoulder?

01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:41.738
- Yes.
- There.

01:02:41.739 --> 01:02:44.404
They're all gone.
They're all gone.

01:02:44.405 --> 01:02:45.504
They're all gone.

01:02:45.505 --> 01:02:48.502
- They're all gone?
- Yes, they're all gone.

01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.105
Better douse her in the shower.

01:02:51.106 --> 01:02:54.103
Come on, honey, you're all right.
You're all right.

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:57.837
You're all right.

01:03:02.406 --> 01:03:05.403
That's quite a technique.

01:03:06.706 --> 01:03:09.703
I would've thought you'd put her
on display, charge a little extra.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.870
No. It's too real.

01:05:04.379 --> 01:05:07.376
Gloria?

01:05:19.213 --> 01:05:22.210
I hope that little episode in there
didn't shake you up too much.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.577
No.

01:05:32.046 --> 01:05:35.044
Cigarette?

01:05:36.147 --> 01:05:39.144
No.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:54.478
No.

01:06:04.748 --> 01:06:07.745
Ten minutes rest, folks,
and then the dance goes on and on.

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:11.045
Remember, one admission
entitles you to stay as long as you like.

01:06:12.115 --> 01:06:15.112
So, while the kids are resting and being
attended to by our medical staff,

01:06:15.715 --> 01:06:18.281
why don't you visit
our beautiful Palm Garden,

01:06:18.282 --> 01:06:20.981
where we serve refreshments
of all types.

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:23.979
Thank you, thank you
Yowsah!

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.982
Yeah, that looks
kinda like her dress.

01:06:43.983 --> 01:06:46.980
It is.
You can tell just looking at it.

01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:51.314
Well, even if it is her dress,
it's ruined now.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:55.547
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.850
But aren't you gonna try
to find out?

01:06:57.851 --> 01:07:00.848
I mean, somebody stole it
and ripped it all up.

01:07:03.317 --> 01:07:06.315
Maybe you should call everyone together
and try and find out who did it.

01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:11.848
It wasn't one of the kids.

01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:15.749
How do you know?

01:07:17.752 --> 01:07:20.749
Because I took it.

01:07:25.551 --> 01:07:27.817
- But why?
- For the good of the show.

01:07:27.818 --> 01:07:29.884
That's what we're all
interested in, isn't it?

01:07:29.885 --> 01:07:32.882
The show.

01:07:33.352 --> 01:07:36.349
No, it's a contest.

01:07:37.419 --> 01:07:39.518
Isn't that what it's supposed to be?

01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:41.885
Isn't that what you advertised?
A contest.

01:07:41.886 --> 01:07:43.785
Not for them.

01:07:43.786 --> 01:07:46.618
For you maybe, but not for them.

01:07:46.619 --> 01:07:49.616
You think they're laying out two bits a throw just
to watch you poke your head up into the sunlight?

01:07:50.486 --> 01:07:53.386
Or Alice look like she just
stepped out of a beauty parlor?

01:07:53.387 --> 01:07:56.152
They don't give a damn whether
you win or James and Ruby

01:07:56.153 --> 01:07:59.150
or Mario and Jackie or the Man
in the Moon and Little Miss Muffet.

01:08:01.287 --> 01:08:04.284
They just want to see a little misery out there
so they can feel a little better, maybe.

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.817
They're entitled to that.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.517
Look at us.
We're all like this now.

01:08:14.354 --> 01:08:17.350
Dirty, swollen feet, no sleep.

01:08:19.187 --> 01:08:21.587
What do you want?
Isn't that enough?

01:08:21.587 --> 01:08:24.585
Sure, as long as they can believe in it.

01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:27.618
But how can they with Alice
looking like she's on her way

01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:30.453
to a ball at Buckingham Palace?

01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:32.553
She was breaking the spell.

01:08:32.554 --> 01:08:35.551
Now she looks like she's supposed to,
so now they can believe in her.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.920
Simple enough?

01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.917
Why don't you go sack out
while you got a little break time left?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.618
Yeah.

01:08:56.956 --> 01:08:59.953
Robert?

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.956
Take me outside.

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:21.657
- We can't.
- Please.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.189
Alice, break's almost over.
We can't.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:27.187
Somewhere.
Please, anywhere.

01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:55.191
Talk to me.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:56.524
Alice...

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:59.158
Talk to me.
Tell me things.

01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:01.524
Talk to me.
Hold me.

01:10:01.525 --> 01:10:02.691
My strap--pull it down.

01:10:02.692 --> 01:10:05.125
Kiss me, hold me.
Talk to me.

01:10:05.126 --> 01:10:06.225
Talk to me, Robert.

01:10:06.226 --> 01:10:08.759
- What about?
- About you, about yourself

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.825
The buttons.

01:10:09.826 --> 01:10:12.125
About where you grew up.
Tell me where you were born.

01:10:12.126 --> 01:10:14.125
Chicago.
I was born in Chicago.

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:16.759
Chicago. I've never been there.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.625
I can't imagine it.
Tell me about your family.

01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:21.525
- What does your father do?
- He's dead.

01:10:21.526 --> 01:10:23.126
He was a pharmacist,
but he died.

01:10:23.127 --> 01:10:25.759
- It's caught, Alice.
- Pull it.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.159
He caught the flu and he died.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.059
It's caught.
I can't get it undone.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.057
- What should I do?
- Pull it!

01:10:33.494 --> 01:10:35.626
There.

01:10:35.627 --> 01:10:38.624
Kiss me.
Touch me.

01:10:39.294 --> 01:10:41.626
Kiss me, kiss me.

01:10:41.627 --> 01:10:44.624
- Alice, somebody's gonna come in.
- It doesn't matter.

01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:48.358
Kiss me.

01:10:56.194 --> 01:10:58.794
Tell me about your--
Did you have brothers?

01:10:58.795 --> 01:11:01.094
- Sisters?
- No.

01:11:01.095 --> 01:11:04.092
I had a brother.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.759
He died at the Somme.

01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:14.662
Guess what his name was.
Try to guess.

01:11:14.663 --> 01:11:15.795
- I don't know.
- Guess, guess!

01:11:15.796 --> 01:11:17.762
- I don't know.
- Guess, guess!

01:11:17.763 --> 01:11:19.461
- I don't know.
- It's so easy.

01:11:19.462 --> 01:11:22.459
- George. Robert.
- No.

01:11:42.697 --> 01:11:45.694
No, wait, don't leave.

01:12:07.299 --> 01:12:10.296
- Alice, I--
- Don't, don't.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.796
After a few minutes,
play my favorite number.

01:12:48.234 --> 01:12:51.231
- Well, shall we dance?
- Go to hell.

01:13:31.735 --> 01:13:33.068
Perfect.

01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:35.168
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:38.166
our own Russ Columbo--
Mr. Coley James.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.037
Gloria?

01:15:19.874 --> 01:15:21.140
Hot dogs!

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:24.138
Premier Mussolini was promoted
tonight, says Norman H. Davis,

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:26.939
American disarmament
representative at Geneva,

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.873
at a dinner in one
of the leading hotels of Rome

01:15:29.874 --> 01:15:31.640
Signore Marconi, the inventor,

01:15:31.641 --> 01:15:33.206
various members of the cabinet,

01:15:33.207 --> 01:15:36.204
and Alexander Kirk,
American Charge d'Affaires

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:39.705
with members of the American
Embassy staff also attended.

01:15:40.775 --> 01:15:42.440
Following cordial conversations

01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:44.274
with the Premier
and his cabinet members,

01:15:44.275 --> 01:15:46.974
Mr. Davis went
to Mr. Kirk's home, where they...

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.207
Don't touch me.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:50.207
...results of the election
over the radio

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:52.940
Mr. Davis continues
his disarmament discussions today

01:15:52.941 --> 01:15:55.939
with Italian experts in a long
interview at the Foreign Office.

01:15:57.542 --> 01:16:00.539
In Boston, Anthony Bender, 43,
was allowed to vote,

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:04.242
but first,
he had to prove he was alive.

01:16:04.243 --> 01:16:06.409
When Bender entered
the polling place,

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:09.407
he was challenged,
"Sorry, you can't vote here."

01:16:09.909 --> 01:16:11.642
"Why not?" he asked.

01:16:11.643 --> 01:16:14.640
"You're listed as dead,"
he was told.

01:16:14.909 --> 01:16:17.842
Bender immediately produced
proof he was very much alive,

01:16:17.843 --> 01:16:20.840
and officials decided
he could cast his ballot.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.143
Firemen in Detroit
are still battling the fire

01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:27.141
that has claimed the life of Johnny Sciutto
and his brother Guido.

01:16:27.476 --> 01:16:30.474
Fire Chief DeCoine says containment
is not expected until early tomorrow morning

01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:35.840
Damage is estimated
in excess of $41,000.

01:16:37.411 --> 01:16:40.408
This is 50,000 watt
Clear Channel station KFI...

01:16:41.544 --> 01:16:43.510
- Don't!
- in downtown Los Angeles.

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:45.177
And now,
a look at the weather.

01:16:45.178 --> 01:16:47.743
Temperatures are expected
to drop to the middle 40s

01:16:47.744 --> 01:16:50.741
in parts of the San Joaquin Valley...

01:16:54.111 --> 01:16:57.108
Late night and early morning fog
is expected at all beach areas,

01:16:57.545 --> 01:16:59.544
with temperatures in the low 50s.

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:01.344
Tomorrow should be
clear and warmer,

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:04.342
with a high of 64 downtown,
60 at the beaches, and 68...

01:17:40.647 --> 01:17:43.644
I changed my mind.

01:17:45.147 --> 01:17:48.145
Your partner's waiting for you

01:17:55.515 --> 01:17:58.512
She was leaning against the railing.

01:17:59.415 --> 01:18:02.412
She was completely relaxed,
completely comfortable.

01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.047
I didn't have a perfect view,

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.046
but I could see enough of her face and lips
to see that she was...

01:18:11.715 --> 01:18:13.547
...smiling.

01:18:13.548 --> 01:18:16.545
One thousand hours!

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.945
And to help us
celebrate the occasion,

01:18:26.215 --> 01:18:28.782
Jeff Maxon and his music!

01:18:28.783 --> 01:18:31.780
Take it away, Jeff!

01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:39.547
Yowsah! One thousand hours
of continuous dancing.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.547
Forty-two days
of grueling, grinding,

01:18:47.317 --> 01:18:50.314
gravity-defying gyration,
and here they still are.

01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:55.347
Twenty-one courageous couples
still dancing

01:18:57.017 --> 01:19:00.014
And how long before
one of them, and just one,

01:19:01.117 --> 01:19:04.114
will survive to win
the monster marathon?

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:17.481
Gloria?

01:19:20.218 --> 01:19:22.717
Who's that?

01:19:22.718 --> 01:19:25.715
No one.

01:19:27.552 --> 01:19:30.549
You wanna talk?

01:19:33.719 --> 01:19:36.716
No.

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:45.352
I wish you'd go back to her.

01:19:45.353 --> 01:19:48.350
How?
You know what she thinks.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:53.052
That didn't happen.

01:19:53.053 --> 01:19:56.051
- Wanna move on the other side?
- No.

01:19:59.653 --> 01:20:02.650
- Sleep?
- No.

01:20:03.421 --> 01:20:06.418
What the hell do you want?

01:20:10.387 --> 01:20:13.384
- Anyone ever tell you you're--
- Yeah, they told me.

01:21:03.923 --> 01:21:06.920
And don't forget, folks,
ladies free at matinee tomorrow.

01:21:10.123 --> 01:21:13.120
Until 3pm, that is.

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:15.989
And I have an important announcement here

01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:18.987
about John Hirschman,
reserved seat cashier.

01:21:19.524 --> 01:21:22.521
He is now happily convalescing
at Santa Monica Hospital

01:21:23.124 --> 01:21:25.856
after a severe attack of appendicitis

01:21:25.857 --> 01:21:28.854
We know that you'll join us
in congratulations to him

01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:31.854
and wishing him a speedy recovery

01:21:32.558 --> 01:21:35.555
Thank you, thank you, thank you

01:22:06.626 --> 01:22:08.125
Inside of the floor.

01:22:08.126 --> 01:22:10.858
These people are paying to see you.

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:13.856
- All right.
- Come on.

01:22:13.893 --> 01:22:16.890
I'm coming!

01:22:36.428 --> 01:22:39.425
Moon belongs to everyone

01:22:43.394 --> 01:22:46.391
The best things in life are free

01:22:52.062 --> 01:22:55.059
The stars belong to everyone

01:23:00.529 --> 01:23:03.526
They gleam there for you and me

01:23:09.095 --> 01:23:12.093
The flowers in spring

01:23:13.096 --> 01:23:16.093
The robins that sing

01:23:17.196 --> 01:23:20.193
The sunbeams that shine

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:24.427
they're yours, they're mine

01:23:26.096 --> 01:23:29.093
And love can come to everyone

01:23:34.164 --> 01:23:37.161
The best things in life are free

01:23:42.863 --> 01:23:45.860
The best things in life are free

01:23:55.131 --> 01:23:57.963
Beautiful, beautiful!

01:23:57.964 --> 01:24:00.130
How about that?
Wasn't that nice?

01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:02.697
Our own number 68!

01:24:02.698 --> 01:24:05.696
This is Ruby Fix, a lovely little lady
with an armful of charm

01:24:07.365 --> 01:24:10.362
a roomful of courage,
and a houseful of hope.

01:24:10.998 --> 01:24:13.996
And I know you all join me
in wishing her and her bundle of joy

01:24:16.665 --> 01:24:19.662
a joyous ride through life.

01:24:27.899 --> 01:24:29.632
I just hope it was worth it to ya.

01:24:29.633 --> 01:24:32.165
We need the money.

01:24:32.166 --> 01:24:34.699
It's celebrity time again tonight, folks.

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.099
A welcome
for Miss Helen Twelvetrees

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.097
and that rising young star,
Mr. Ross Alexander!

01:24:44.033 --> 01:24:47.030
But every night is celebrity night
at the mammoth marathon.

01:24:48.367 --> 01:24:51.364
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

01:24:58.767 --> 01:25:00.233
She looks like her kinda.

01:25:00.234 --> 01:25:03.231
Who?

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:08.398
Like my aunt.

01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:12.334
God, what a bitch.

01:25:12.335 --> 01:25:14.667
He said he was gonna be here.

01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:17.665
lf there was a prize for bitchiness,
she'd have won.

01:25:18.568 --> 01:25:21.565
Glasses, short balding guy.

01:25:21.702 --> 01:25:23.467
Pits, like from acne.

01:25:23.468 --> 01:25:25.567
Christ, you should've
heard her screaming.

01:25:25.568 --> 01:25:28.535
- "Get that mangy mutt outta here."
- He's assistant director.

01:25:28.536 --> 01:25:31.001
"You ain't bringing no animal
into my boarding house."

01:25:31.002 --> 01:25:33.501
He's going on a ten-day
western at Monogram.

01:25:33.502 --> 01:25:36.001
I wouldn't have brought him
back there, anyway.

01:25:36.002 --> 01:25:38.234
Maybe something for me in it.
Something, maybe.

01:25:38.235 --> 01:25:39.968
He just followed me, that's all.

01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:42.501
Maybe, maybe. Maybe.

01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:45.302
And I wouldn't have kept him,
except she started screaming.

01:25:45.303 --> 01:25:46.702
I hope he wasn't stringing me.

01:25:46.703 --> 01:25:48.902
I said I'd tell her husband she was
screwing one of the boarders,

01:25:48.903 --> 01:25:51.900
- Crumb.
- which she probably was

01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:58.567
But he was sick inside
with something.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.402
Her husband?

01:26:01.403 --> 01:26:03.169
No.

01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.703
The boarder.

01:26:04.704 --> 01:26:07.701
No, for Christ's sake, the dog!

01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:12.501
And it kept getting worse, so he'd shake
all the time and dirty himself all over...

01:26:13.804 --> 01:26:16.136
and whine and cry all night long.

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:19.134
Stupid damn thing!

01:26:19.571 --> 01:26:22.568
He kept whimpering
and hollering and wouldn't shut up.

01:26:24.671 --> 01:26:27.668
I mean, what the hell is God doing
sitting around up there?

01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:30.868
What the hell good is He if He can't
make one lousy sick dog shut up

01:26:30.971 --> 01:26:33.968
and stop waking up
her goddamn boarders?

01:26:36.272 --> 01:26:39.269
And you know what I did?

01:26:40.472 --> 01:26:43.469
See, after everybody had gone to bed,
I carried him down to the parlor.

01:26:45.439 --> 01:26:48.436
And she had this mohair sofa--
it was her favorite one.

01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:52.270
And I fixed him a place on it.

01:27:00.273 --> 01:27:03.270
What the hell, forget it.

01:27:18.873 --> 01:27:21.870
You should be sleeping.

01:27:22.973 --> 01:27:25.606
I'd just wake up.

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:28.604
You want anything?
Something for your feet?

01:27:28.741 --> 01:27:31.074
How about a saw?

01:27:31.075 --> 01:27:34.072
Is there anything the doctor can give you?
Something to make you feel better?

01:27:34.474 --> 01:27:37.472
- What's he got?
- Some aspirin.

01:27:39.941 --> 01:27:42.938
That's what I figured.

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:04.442
- Have you seen Joel?
- I seen him, all right.

01:28:04.443 --> 01:28:07.440
Boy, that's a real sweetheart
you picked this time--just like that.

01:28:07.576 --> 01:28:10.573
And I'm the one
that's gotta tell Rocky.

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:15.675
Cheers.

01:28:15.676 --> 01:28:18.343
Don't give me any of that song
and dance crap! What's going on?

01:28:18.344 --> 01:28:20.642
Just exactly what appears
to be going on.

01:28:20.643 --> 01:28:23.509
I've shaved, I've changed,
and I am now packing.

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:25.643
- For what?
- I have a job.

01:28:25.644 --> 01:28:28.242
It's not much of a job,
but it's a job.

01:28:28.243 --> 01:28:30.242
Ten days in a Monogram western.

01:28:30.243 --> 01:28:33.240
You bastard!
You're not running out on me!

01:28:33.477 --> 01:28:36.474
No? Just stand there
and watch, sweetheart.

01:28:42.178 --> 01:28:44.577
Will she make it?

01:28:44.578 --> 01:28:46.077
Will she make it?

01:28:46.078 --> 01:28:49.075
After over 1,100 hours
of incredible endurance,

01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:52.775
there she is, alone,
but still fighting,

01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:56.208
still hoping,
still trusting--Gloria Beatty.

01:28:57.845 --> 01:29:00.842
Seventeen hours--
that's all she has left.

01:29:02.645 --> 01:29:05.642
Will she find a new partner
before those hours run out?

01:29:07.079 --> 01:29:10.076
Will fortune reward
her pluck and spirit?

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:14.710
Will she make it?

01:29:41.914 --> 01:29:44.879
I ain't quittin'.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.877
I'm not gonna give up.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.447
How are the tabs?

01:29:54.448 --> 01:29:55.780
Pretty much the same.

01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:58.778
Phone calls are down,
cleaning's up.

01:30:09.815 --> 01:30:12.812
Yeah?

01:30:15.682 --> 01:30:18.679
What happens
if I don't get a partner?

01:30:19.349 --> 01:30:22.346
You've got 11, almost 12 hours.

01:30:23.582 --> 01:30:25.648
I can count.

01:30:25.649 --> 01:30:28.581
What happens?

01:30:28.582 --> 01:30:31.580
You know the rules.

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:38.080
You could change 'em.

01:30:38.883 --> 01:30:41.880
No. The crowd's got to have
something they believe in.

01:30:42.783 --> 01:30:45.780
Once they quit believing,
they quit coming.

01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:49.847
Anything else, but not that

01:31:12.485 --> 01:31:15.482
Tommy, we got a dead one.

01:31:16.385 --> 01:31:19.382
Just give him to me.

01:31:22.919 --> 01:31:25.916
Here we go.

01:31:29.318 --> 01:31:32.316
Jesus!

01:31:35.219 --> 01:31:37.485
If two knees
touch the floor, she's out!

01:31:37.486 --> 01:31:40.483
Come on! Come on!

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.416
Come on, Sailor!

01:31:51.986 --> 01:31:54.983
Out! Take her away.

01:31:59.554 --> 01:32:00.919
Miss Shirley Clayton.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.917
We're going to miss you, Shirl.
Isn't that right, folks?

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:09.753
So long, Shirl, but don't despair.

01:32:09.754 --> 01:32:12.751
Every heart in this room is with you,
and that's what really counts.

01:32:17.521 --> 01:32:19.087
It's hard on all of us,

01:32:19.088 --> 01:32:22.085
after we've lived all these hours
and weeks together,

01:32:22.254 --> 01:32:25.251
to see one of these wonderful,
courageous kids fallout.

01:32:25.488 --> 01:32:28.485
But life goes on,
and so does the marathon!

01:32:58.723 --> 01:32:59.955
Three minutes left!

01:32:59.956 --> 01:33:02.953
Three minutes of harrowing,
heart-breaking hustle!

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:04.356
Yowsah!

01:33:04.357 --> 01:33:07.022
Over 1,200 hours
of continuous dancing,

01:33:07.023 --> 01:33:09.289
and yet there they still are,

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:11.756
fighting, struggling to stay in the race

01:33:11.757 --> 01:33:14.123
But the last three couples will lose

01:33:14.124 --> 01:33:17.121
The last three couples
will be eliminated!

01:33:17.357 --> 01:33:20.355
Yowsah, yowsah!
Come on, let's hear it, folks!

01:33:28.491 --> 01:33:31.488
Let's hear it over there!

01:35:09.795 --> 01:35:12.792
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- My chest!

01:35:16.929 --> 01:35:19.927
Come on, lean on me.
Put your arm around me.

01:35:22.196 --> 01:35:24.795
Lean on me!

01:35:24.796 --> 01:35:27.793
Where does it hurt?
What is it?

01:35:28.896 --> 01:35:31.893
One minute!

01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:35.227
It's just a little bit further!

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.696
Come on, you salty old bastard!

01:35:38.697 --> 01:35:40.329
Where's the fight? Come on!

01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:41.696
Come on, goddamn it!

01:35:41.697 --> 01:35:43.963
Hang on to me!
I'm tired of losing!

01:35:43.964 --> 01:35:46.961
Come on!

01:35:53.298 --> 01:35:56.295
It looks like our sea faring man and our little
hard luck lady are in deep trouble.

01:36:00.732 --> 01:36:03.729
Come on, goddamn it!
We're gonna make it.

01:36:04.498 --> 01:36:07.495
Thirty seconds!

01:36:07.798 --> 01:36:10.164
Walk!

01:36:10.165 --> 01:36:13.162
Walk! Walk!

01:36:21.666 --> 01:36:24.663
Walk, goddamn it!

01:36:30.899 --> 01:36:33.896
Walk!

01:36:34.066 --> 01:36:36.598
We're gonna make it!

01:36:36.599 --> 01:36:38.099
- Five!
- Walk!

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.599
- Four!
- Come on!

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.597
Three! Two! One!

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.165
Scratch them three kids,

01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:49.399
- and there are the losers!
- Sailor, we made it!

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.366
Get 'em to the spots.

01:36:51.367 --> 01:36:52.599
- Arthur and Jean...
- Sailor!

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.266
Pattie and Don,
Dusty and Jessel...

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:56.367
We made it!

01:36:56.368 --> 01:36:59.333
Let's have a big hand
for the losers.

01:36:59.334 --> 01:37:02.331
Come on, folks, let's hear it

01:37:10.434 --> 01:37:13.431
It looks like our ancient mariner
may have taken a little spill.

01:37:14.434 --> 01:37:16.368
There's nothing to worry about

01:37:16.369 --> 01:37:18.101
He's all right!
Leave him alone!

01:37:18.102 --> 01:37:19.734
- Get her off me!
- No, please!

01:37:19.735 --> 01:37:22.732
- Get her out of here!
- He's gonna be all right!

01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:27.666
What are they doing to him?
He's gonna be all right.

01:37:39.502 --> 01:37:42.102
I just had a message
from our house physician.

01:37:42.103 --> 01:37:44.268
Nothing in the least serious

01:37:44.269 --> 01:37:47.266
Just a case of heat prostration.

01:37:47.936 --> 01:37:50.934
And I understand that Harry,
crusty old salt that he is,

01:37:51.937 --> 01:37:53.869
wanted to stay on in the marathon,

01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:56.867
but the doc says "no,"
and when it comes to something like this,

01:37:57.503 --> 01:38:00.500
the doctor's word is law.

01:38:08.404 --> 01:38:11.303
He's gonna be all right.

01:38:11.304 --> 01:38:13.203
So long, Sailor.

01:38:13.204 --> 01:38:15.236
But we know
you'll be back to see us

01:38:15.237 --> 01:38:18.235
and to cheer the other kids on.

01:38:22.004 --> 01:38:25.001
You have ten minutes
to enjoy yourself

01:38:25.171 --> 01:38:28.168
in our beautiful Palm Garden.

01:38:58.306 --> 01:39:00.405
But I'm not better off.

01:39:00.406 --> 01:39:03.403
I'm sorry.

01:39:15.207 --> 01:39:18.204
Alice

01:39:27.074 --> 01:39:29.273
Oh, my God.

01:39:29.274 --> 01:39:32.271
Get out of the way.

01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:54.106
Get out of here.

01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:57.706
Come on, move, dammit!

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.342
You can come out now.

01:40:18.343 --> 01:40:21.340
Nobody's gonna hurt you

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:28.342
Don't you wanna come out now?

01:40:28.343 --> 01:40:31.341
You might catch cold in there.

01:40:34.211 --> 01:40:37.208
You don't wanna do that, do you?

01:40:37.378 --> 01:40:40.375
Please.

01:40:45.311 --> 01:40:48.077
I just wanna help you.

01:40:48.078 --> 01:40:51.075
I just wanna turn off
the water, that's all.

01:40:54.045 --> 01:40:57.042
I just wanna turn off the handle.

01:41:00.978 --> 01:41:03.077
All right, I won't...

01:41:03.078 --> 01:41:06.075
...if you don't want me to.

01:41:14.746 --> 01:41:17.743
Tell me.

01:41:19.546 --> 01:41:22.543
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

01:41:29.114 --> 01:41:32.111
He...touched me.

01:41:36.047 --> 01:41:39.044
Who?

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.277
He...touched me.

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.077
Get out of here!

01:41:50.447 --> 01:41:53.444
Is he dead?

01:41:54.647 --> 01:41:56.880
Sailor?

01:41:56.881 --> 01:41:59.878
You mean Sailor?

01:42:02.014 --> 01:42:04.280
No.

01:42:04.281 --> 01:42:07.278
You have my personal word
he's gonna be fine.

01:42:40.483 --> 01:42:43.481
Someone screamed.

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:47.280
That was you, Alice.

01:43:05.751 --> 01:43:08.749
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl, boy gets girl!

01:43:11.284 --> 01:43:13.884
That's the story
of our sweetheart couple--

01:43:13.885 --> 01:43:16.882
Gloria Beatty and Robert Siverton!

01:43:19.718 --> 01:43:22.017
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

01:43:22.018 --> 01:43:25.015
Now, I'm no Hollywood scenario writer,

01:43:25.651 --> 01:43:28.184
but I know what
the end of this story should be.

01:43:28.185 --> 01:43:30.451
Right, Robert?
Right, Gloria?

01:43:30.452 --> 01:43:31.884
Wrong.

01:43:31.885 --> 01:43:34.883
Does the prisoner wish to make a statement
to the court before sentence is passed?

01:43:40.086 --> 01:43:43.083
No.

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:48.916
No, sir.

01:43:49.353 --> 01:43:51.319
Come in, come in, kids.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.317
Just sit down,
make yourselves comfortable.

01:43:54.587 --> 01:43:57.584
I know this is your rest period,
so just sit down and rest.

01:44:03.087 --> 01:44:06.084
I had a little notion, kids--
something that could help the show,

01:44:06.287 --> 01:44:08.153
something could benefit all of us.

01:44:08.154 --> 01:44:11.120
And in particular,
it could benefit the two of you,

01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:12.320
and at the same time,

01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:15.318
give the folks out there
something to get worked up about.

01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:19.518
What are you gonna do--put us in cages
and let 'em throw peanuts at us?

01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:20.987
All kidding aside--

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:23.985
Who's kidding?

01:44:29.122 --> 01:44:32.119
The thing I want is I want
you two kids to get married.

01:44:35.955 --> 01:44:37.888
Right here on the dance floor.

01:44:37.889 --> 01:44:40.886
A public wedding.

01:44:41.555 --> 01:44:44.287
I mean, you get divorced
right after the show, if you want.

01:44:44.288 --> 01:44:47.286
It's just for effect.

01:44:48.756 --> 01:44:50.521
What do you say to that, Robert?

01:44:50.522 --> 01:44:53.520
- I don't know, I guess so.
- He says no.

01:44:54.623 --> 01:44:56.555
Does she do
all the talking for you, Robert?

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:59.553
That's right.

01:45:01.957 --> 01:45:04.022
Well...

01:45:04.023 --> 01:45:07.020
Robert, maybe it'd be better
if just her and me discussed it.

01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:08.689
Okay?

01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:11.687
Yeah, sure.

01:45:12.457 --> 01:45:15.454
But the idea is okay with you.
That's what you said, right?

01:45:15.624 --> 01:45:18.390
No, sir, I didn't say that at all.
All I said was--

01:45:18.391 --> 01:45:20.623
It's the same thing,
it's the same thing.

01:45:20.624 --> 01:45:23.621
It'll just be a minute.

01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:37.657
What's your problem?

01:45:37.658 --> 01:45:39.790
You're afraid of getting married?

01:45:39.791 --> 01:45:42.789
You're not happy until you've
screwed everything up, are you?

01:45:44.358 --> 01:45:47.355
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

01:45:47.859 --> 01:45:50.424
I'm not marrying anybody!

01:45:50.425 --> 01:45:52.924
It's business!

01:45:52.925 --> 01:45:54.924
Strictly business, for God's sake.

01:45:54.925 --> 01:45:57.922
Look, you come out with something--
new clothes...

01:45:58.725 --> 01:46:00.725
...plenty of free gifts, silverware,

01:46:00.726 --> 01:46:02.924
waffle irons, toasters,
that kind of stuff.

01:46:02.925 --> 01:46:04.958
What am I gonna do
with crap like that?

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:06.725
Sell it, hawk it!

01:46:06.726 --> 01:46:08.992
Look, for God's sake,
I'm trying to help you a little.

01:46:08.993 --> 01:46:11.990
Maybe you'll come out
with 2 or 300 bucks--that's something.

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:16.057
Unless you wanna walk out of here
with the pennies they're throwing at you

01:46:17.127 --> 01:46:20.124
Yeah? And what if
just maybe we win?

01:46:27.727 --> 01:46:30.724
Look, sweetheart, I've been
in this business a long time.

01:46:32.293 --> 01:46:35.291
I may not know a winner
when I see one...

01:46:36.061 --> 01:46:39.058
...but I sure as hell can spot a loser.

01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.958
You son of a bitch!

01:46:44.961 --> 01:46:47.394
Maybe.

01:46:47.395 --> 01:46:50.392
Do you wanna come out of this
with a couple hundred bucks or don't you?

01:46:51.194 --> 01:46:53.994
The winners get 750 apiece.

01:46:53.995 --> 01:46:56.992
Right, less the bills.

01:46:57.195 --> 01:46:59.994
What bills?

01:46:59.995 --> 01:47:02.992
Look, this marathon
don't run itself, you know.

01:47:03.362 --> 01:47:05.728
I got bills stacked up every day.

01:47:05.729 --> 01:47:07.395
And I keep tabs.

01:47:07.396 --> 01:47:08.961
You kids cost me money.

01:47:08.962 --> 01:47:11.960
Extra laundry, cleaning, phone calls,
medical bills, you name it.

01:47:13.429 --> 01:47:14.928
What is this?

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:17.926
The tabs on you and Robert.

01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:22.229
You're charging me this?

01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:24.629
Only if you win.

01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:27.627
If you don't win, you don't pay.
I'm not out to cheat anybody.

01:47:40.397 --> 01:47:43.395
Oh, Jesus.

01:47:43.797 --> 01:47:46.794
Gloria, we have to get back.

01:47:50.398 --> 01:47:53.395
What the hell's the point?

01:48:00.398 --> 01:48:03.396
Right.

01:49:14.535 --> 01:49:17.532
Where the hell's the other one?

01:49:20.602 --> 01:49:23.599
Well, don't just stand there.
Why don't you help me?

01:49:25.769 --> 01:49:28.667
What does it look like exactly?

01:49:28.668 --> 01:49:31.665
Like this. What do you think
it's gonna look like, a necktie?

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:37.868
I'll tell you one thing.

01:49:37.869 --> 01:49:40.867
I'm not leaving this
goddamn stink hole without it.

01:49:41.302 --> 01:49:43.268
That's the last pair I got.

01:49:43.269 --> 01:49:46.266
And I cut out streetcars
for a month to get 'em.

01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:49.336
Is this it?

01:49:49.337 --> 01:49:52.334
No, for Christ' sake, it's silk.

01:50:02.537 --> 01:50:03.703
I found it.

01:50:03.704 --> 01:50:05.036
Here, is this it?

01:50:05.037 --> 01:50:08.034
Yeah.

01:50:09.204 --> 01:50:12.201
Jesus, I'm sorry.

01:50:25.037 --> 01:50:28.035
Gloria, don't...

01:50:30.571 --> 01:50:32.871
Look, maybe you can
fix it up or something,

01:50:32.872 --> 01:50:35.869
sort of sew it up or...

01:50:35.972 --> 01:50:38.969
Gloria, let me see it.
Maybe you can sew it up.

01:50:53.839 --> 01:50:56.836
I've still got 71 cents.
Maybe I can buy--

01:50:58.006 --> 01:51:01.003
Shut up!

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.237
It's not
the goddamn stocking, anyway.

01:51:13.607 --> 01:51:16.604
Forget it.

01:52:41.044 --> 01:52:44.041
I used to love
to look at the ocean...

01:52:44.611 --> 01:52:47.609
...walk by it,
just sit and listen to it.

01:52:51.078 --> 01:52:54.075
Now I don't care
if I ever see it again.

01:52:56.812 --> 01:52:59.809
That...or anything else.

01:53:07.912 --> 01:53:10.909
What are you gonna do now?
Try the movies again?

01:53:13.646 --> 01:53:16.643
No.

01:53:17.413 --> 01:53:20.410
I'd never make it.

01:53:22.646 --> 01:53:25.643
And maybe it wouldn't
make no difference even if I did.

01:53:28.213 --> 01:53:31.210
Maybe it's just the whole
damn world is like Central Casting.

01:53:32.913 --> 01:53:35.910
They got it all rigged
before you ever show up.

01:53:37.347 --> 01:53:40.344
I know what you mean.

01:53:41.847 --> 01:53:44.844
I know just what you mean.

01:53:46.447 --> 01:53:49.445
Do you?

01:53:55.314 --> 01:53:58.311
What are you gonna do?

01:54:03.882 --> 01:54:06.879
I'm gonna get off
this merry-go-round.

01:54:08.315 --> 01:54:11.312
I'm so sick
of the whole stinking thing.

01:54:14.416 --> 01:54:17.413
What thing?

01:54:18.082 --> 01:54:21.079
Life.

01:54:22.182 --> 01:54:25.179
And don't give me
no sunshine lectures.

01:54:25.682 --> 01:54:28.679
I wasn't going to.

01:54:30.816 --> 01:54:33.813
Then what were you
looking at me that way for?

01:54:34.682 --> 01:54:37.115
I wasn't.

01:54:37.116 --> 01:54:40.113
I was just trying to see your face

01:54:42.984 --> 01:54:45.981
Well, keep looking.

01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:52.947
Stick around for the end.

01:55:41.919 --> 01:55:44.916
Help me.

01:56:02.087 --> 01:56:05.084
Please. Please.

01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:41.488
Tell me when.

01:56:41.489 --> 01:56:44.486
I'm ready.

01:56:57.157 --> 01:56:59.655
Now?

01:56:59.656 --> 01:57:02.653
Now.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:20.000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

01:57:33.191 --> 01:57:35.257
What happened?

01:57:35.258 --> 01:57:37.457
Just move on.

01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:40.455
Better things to do. Beat it.

01:58:04.492 --> 01:58:07.489
Come on, let's go.

01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:12.257
Let's go.

01:58:15.893 --> 01:58:18.891
Why'd you do it, kid?

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:24.424
She asked me to.

01:58:25.927 --> 01:58:28.924
Obliging bastard.

01:58:36.327 --> 01:58:39.324
That the only reason
you got, kid?

01:58:40.194 --> 01:58:42.960
They shoot horses, don't they?

01:58:42.961 --> 01:58:45.958
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

01:58:46.028 --> 01:58:47.660
Here they are again!

01:58:47.661 --> 01:58:50.658
These wonderful, wonderful kids,
still struggling, still hoping

01:58:53.795 --> 01:58:56.792
As the clock of fate ticks away,

01:58:57.262 --> 01:59:00.259
the dance of destiny continues!

01:59:01.595 --> 01:59:04.592
The marathon goes on
and on and on.

01:59:07.163 --> 01:59:10.160
How long can they last?

01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:13.028
Let's hear it!
Come on!

01:59:13.029 --> 01:59:15.961
Let's hear it!
Let's hear it!

01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:28.229
