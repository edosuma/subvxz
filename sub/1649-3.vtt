WEBVTT

00:08.009 --> 00:10.091
(water draining)

00:13.514 --> 00:16.597
(clippers buzzing )

01:02.396 --> 01:04.933
( breathing heavily )

01:13.824 --> 01:16.440
(theme music playing )

01:50.236 --> 01:51.897
Lori:
Rick, just...

01:52.071 --> 01:54.027
you've got to keep
your strength up.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.615
Rick:
Lori, did you...

01:57.785 --> 02:01.118
I mean,
it was legendary.

02:01.289 --> 02:05.077
Did you ever hear about the time
Shane stole Kingsley's car?

02:05.251 --> 02:07.617
Lori: Yeah.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.535
Rick:
The principal's car

02:09.714 --> 02:11.420
right out of the teacher's lot

02:11.590 --> 02:13.296
in the middle
of a school day.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.300
Shane steps out of lunch
and makes a beeline

02:16.470 --> 02:19.086
to Kingsley's Hyundai...
( chuckles )

02:19.265 --> 02:22.598
wires the ignition, peels out,
drives down Dylan Drive

02:22.768 --> 02:24.099
to that chicken farm
out there.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.807
You've heard
this before, right?

02:26.981 --> 02:30.599
So he pulls it into one
of the big holding pens.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.392
Kingsley, he waxed
that thing every month;

02:33.571 --> 02:36.779
had the auto shop
vacuum it out every week.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.816
Shane, he parks it
in this huge pen

02:39.994 --> 02:42.110
with a couple of hundred
Rhode Island reds.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.995
He busts open bags of seed
in the back seat,

02:45.166 --> 02:47.327
rolls down all the windows,

02:47.501 --> 02:50.083
and then starts sprinting
back to school.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.587
lt's three miles away easy.

02:53.758 --> 02:57.250
He's back in time to finish
his sandwich before the bell.

02:57.428 --> 02:59.760
And then the bell rings.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.673
Shane gets up and when he runs
into Kingsley in the hallway

03:03.851 --> 03:06.137
he looks out the window
and says,

03:06.312 --> 03:09.099
"Principal Kingsley,

03:09.273 --> 03:12.265
yourcoupds
gone?

03:12.443 --> 03:14.149
( chuckles )

03:14.320 --> 03:17.483
Coupe, like chicken coop.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.612
| get it.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.991
Of course you do.

03:22.161 --> 03:25.995
You've heard this story
1,000 times.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.208
What you said before,
you're right.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.583
Shane's gonna make it back
with what the doctor needs.

03:35.758 --> 03:36.747
He'll make it back.

03:36.926 --> 03:40.089
Hershel said
you need to eat.

03:40.262 --> 03:44.005
Carl's gonna be all right.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.803
Please, for me.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.188
You've got to keep
your strength up.

04:17.967 --> 04:20.424
(metal clinking)

04:20.594 --> 04:23.802
(Carol sobbing )

04:59.133 --> 05:00.589
I need my clip now.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.886
I'm gonna walk the road,
look for the girl.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.327
I'm coming, too.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.157
I'm going for a walk.
Shine some light in the forest.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.996
If she's out there,
give her something to look at.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.660
Do you think that's
a good idea right now?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.578
Dale.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.391
(growling)

05:52.561 --> 05:55.473
Those windows,
what's on the other side?

05:55.648 --> 05:58.435
About a 20-foot drop with nothing
to catch you, maybe some bushes,

05:58.609 --> 06:00.975
- then the athletic field.
- We just need enough time.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.235
We got to get up there.
We got to get 'em open and get out.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.532
- Not me. Maybe you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.236
Come on, man, look at me.
You really think I can squeeze through

06:08.410 --> 06:11.152
one of them tiny windows?
They'd be all over us.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.322
We lay down some fire
to get a head start.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.707
You stay here.
| hop down and draw them away.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.493
That gives you the chance to get up
the bleachers and out a window.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.958
And where do you go?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.713
Locker room
down those steps.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.591
Looks like a good way
to get trapped.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.923
It's got windows too,
and more my size.

06:29.098 --> 06:32.556
| get out through one, I double back,
we meet up out on the field.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.227
You're a crazy son
of a bitch, ain't you?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.727
Just trying to do right
for that boy.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.684
You take three shots
and you go.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.395
After that l fire.
l'll lay down a cover for you.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.652
- I'll get you a lead.
- All right.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.792
Oh, God.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.499
( screams )

08:00.731 --> 08:04.394
( panting )

08:24.546 --> 08:27.208
- ( snaps )
- ( groans )

08:33.389 --> 08:35.550
( gunshots)

08:59.373 --> 09:02.035
( T-Dog shivering )

09:20.310 --> 09:22.301
So do we ring the bell?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.390
I mean, it looks like
people live here.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.806
We're past this kind
of stuff, aren't we?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.815
Having to be considerate.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.773
Did you close the gate
up the road when you drove in?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.063
Uh, hi.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.402
Yes, we closed it.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.283
Did the latch and everything.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.572
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.539
We met before briefly.

09:47.713 --> 09:51.501
Look, we came to help.
There anything we can do?

09:51.675 --> 09:52.915
( groans )

09:54.970 --> 09:59.589
It's not a bite.
I cut myself pretty bad though.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.598
We'll have it looked at.
I'll tell them you're here.

10:01.769 --> 10:06.229
We have some painkillers
and antibiotics.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.231
I already gave him some.
If Carl needs any.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.232
Come on inside.
I'll make you something to eat.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.117
(air hissing)

10:33.342 --> 10:34.798
Hey.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.630
Hey.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.681
Um, we're here, okay?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.807
Thank you.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.355
Whatever you need.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.331
They don't get back soon,
we're gonna have a decision to make.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.038
And that is?

11:10.212 --> 11:12.624
Whether to operate on your
boy without the respirator.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.629
- You said that wouldn't work.
- I know.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.294
It's extremely unlikely.
But we can't wait much longer.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.186
You really think
we're gonna find Sophia?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.524
You got that look
on your face

11:34.695 --> 11:36.526
same as everybody else.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.483
What the hell's wrong
with you people?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.319
- We just started looking.
- Well, do you?

11:41.493 --> 11:44.906
It ain't the mountains of Tibet.
It's Georgia.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.492
She could be holed up
in a farmhouse somewhere.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.577
People get lost
and they survive.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.709
- It happens all the time.
- She's only 12.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.916
Hell, l was younger
than her and I got lost.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.877
Nine days in the woods
eating berries,

11:58.051 --> 12:00.042
wiping my ass
with poison oak.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.051
They found you?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.884
My old man was off on
a bender with some waitress.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.765
Merle was doing another
stint in juvie.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.222
Didn't even know
I was gone.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.513
I made my way back though.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.103
Went straight into the kitchen
and made myself a sandwich.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.019
No worse for wear.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.938
Except my ass itched
something awful.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.731
( laughs)

12:22.910 --> 12:24.741
I'm sorry.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.777
I'm sorry, that is
a terrible story.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.913
( both laugh )

12:30.083 --> 12:33.246
Only difference is Sophia's
got people looking for her.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.127
I call that an advantage.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.270
Maybe this isn't a world
for children anymore.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.397
Yeah, well,
we have a child.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.729
Carl is here
in this world now.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.394
Maybe he shouldn't be.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.779
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to be.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.614
You can't mean that.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.786
Okay. All right.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.077
I can understand that
thought crossing your mind.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.996
It didn't cross my mind, Rick.
I can't stop thinking it.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.257
Why do we want Carl
to live in this world?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.463
To have this life?

13:24.638 --> 13:28.301
So he can see more people
torn apart in front of him?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.137
So that he can be
hungry and scared

13:31.311 --> 13:34.474
for however long
he has before he...

13:35.857 --> 13:39.691
So he can run and run
and run and run

13:39.861 --> 13:42.773
and then even if he
survives, he ends up--

13:44.908 --> 13:46.318
he ends up just another animal

13:46.493 --> 13:48.529
who doesn't know anything
except survival?

13:48.704 --> 13:51.161
If he--

13:51.331 --> 13:54.368
if he dies tonight,

13:54.543 --> 13:57.000
it ends for him.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.003
Tell me why it would
be better another way.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.843
What changed?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.005
What?

14:09.182 --> 14:12.549
Jenner offered us
a way out.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.684
You asked him
to let us keep trying.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.470
You begged him.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.889
"For as long as we can," you said.
What changed?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.523
There was a moment
the other day--

14:20.694 --> 14:23.857
it was just a second,
but I forgot Jacqui was dead.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.272
I turned around,
I wanted to tell her something.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.530
I almost said her name.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.067
It was just a second
and then I remembered.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.907
But then I realized
she didn't have to see any of it.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.413
The highway, the herds,
Sophia, Carl getting shot--

14:38.587 --> 14:41.420
she didn't--

14:43.383 --> 14:46.341
she doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.002
Hungry. Angry.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.718
It hasn't stopped
happening, Rick.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.259
It's like we live with a knife at our
throats every second of every day.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.224
But Jacqui doesn't.
Not anymore.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.060
And then...

15:03.070 --> 15:05.402
I thought,
"Maybe Jenner was right."

15:09.242 --> 15:11.904
I don't accept that.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.910
I can't accept that.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.914
That man surrendered.
It doesn't matt--

15:17.084 --> 15:20.622
it doesn't matter
what he said.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.707
None of it.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.373
You really think it would
be better if Carl--

15:30.889 --> 15:33.972
if we just gave up?

15:34.142 --> 15:38.476
Tell me why it would
be better the other way.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.440
Please.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.946
(walkers moaning )

16:23.984 --> 16:25.770
(Shane groans)

16:57.684 --> 16:59.640
(gunshot)

17:08.695 --> 17:11.186
Man, I thought
I'd lost you.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.025
That was my last
rifle round.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.065
- Mine too.
- Come on.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.779
Come on.
Come on.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.046
(Carl coughing)

17:42.062 --> 17:45.304
- Where are we?
- Hey, little man.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.723
That's Hershel.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.142
We're in his house.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.402
You had an accident.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.439
- All right?
- It hurts, a lot.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.108
Oh, baby, I know.
I know.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.116
- You should have seen it.
- What?

18:02.290 --> 18:04.451
The deer.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.163
It was so pretty, Mom.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.079
It was so close.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.294
I've never been...

18:20.767 --> 18:21.882
Carl?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.176
What's happening?

18:24.354 --> 18:26.970
- ( grunting )
- Don't. It's a seizure.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.934
If you hold him down,
you could hurt him.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.521
- You can't stop it?
- He has to just go through it.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.274
( Lori sobbing )

18:51.089 --> 18:53.705
His brain isn't
getting enough blood.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.590
His pressure is bottoming.
He needs another transfusion.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.218
- Okay, I'm ready.
- If I take any more out of you,

18:59.389 --> 19:01.471
your body could shut down.
You could go into a coma.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.179
- Or cardiac arrest.
- You're wasting time.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.033
Come on, man.
We need a way out.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.997
(gasping )

19:32.172 --> 19:35.380
- Just let me catch my breath.
- Come on.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.418
- ( growling)
-(gaspS)

19:59.324 --> 20:01.565
(stairs clinking)

20:07.457 --> 20:09.243
Can't sleep?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.202
I'm gonna wait for them
to come back.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.748
I'm gonna wait for them
to come back.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.334
You can go down and sleep
if you want to.

20:17.509 --> 20:20.421
No, we can
keep watch together.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.635
Which way did they go?

20:38.988 --> 20:41.274
( rustling )

20:56.965 --> 20:59.502
( rustling )

21:06.516 --> 21:09.007
What the hell?

21:13.231 --> 21:15.313
(gagging)

21:17.235 --> 21:19.226
"Got bit. Fever hit.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.816
World gone to shit.
Might as well quit."

21:21.990 --> 21:24.276
Dumbass didn't know enough
to shoot himself in the head.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.614
Turned himself into a big
swinging piece of bait.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.288
And a mess.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.991
Trying not to puke.

21:35.170 --> 21:38.003
- Go ahead if you gotta.
- No, I'm fine.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.630
Let's just talk about
something else for a moment.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.712
- How'd you learn to shoot?
- Gotta eat.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.344
That's one thing these walkers
and us have in common.

21:46.514 --> 21:50.803
I guess it's the closest
he's been to food since he turned.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.844
Look at him, hanging up there
like a big piﬁata.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.513
The other geeks came and ate
all the flesh off his legs.

21:56.691 --> 21:59.524
(vomits, coughs)

21:59.694 --> 22:03.278
I thought we were
changing the subject.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.736
Call that payback for
laughing about my itchy ass.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.572
There wasn't a lot
that came up.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.911
Huh.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.913
Let's head back.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.791
Aren't you gonna...

22:17.962 --> 22:20.214
No.
He ain't hurting nobody.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.633
Ain't gonna waste
an arrow either.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.132
He made his choice.
Opted out.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.669
Let him hang.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.395
You want to live now
or not?

22:46.658 --> 22:48.944
It's just a question.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.913
An answer for an arrow.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.575
- Fair?
- Mm-hmm.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.245
I don't know
if I want to live

23:02.423 --> 23:05.256
or if I have to

23:05.426 --> 23:07.963
or if it's just a habit.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.635
That's not much of an answer.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.514
Waste of an arrow.

23:33.788 --> 23:36.871
You don't need to worry.
She's with Daryl.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.532
If something happens,
he can protect her.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.326
You hear what I'm saying?

23:41.504 --> 23:44.291
Sorry, all I heard was
if something happens.

23:48.511 --> 23:49.796
You mind keeping watch?

23:49.971 --> 23:51.586
I don't know how
to use that.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.345
I won't be gone long.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.882
If you see anything, call out.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.847
I'm not going far.
l'll hear you.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.774
You got here
right in time.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.489
This couldn't go
untreated much longer.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.082
"Merle Dixon."

24:21.252 --> 24:23.914
Is that your friend
with the antibiotics?

24:24.088 --> 24:26.249
No, ma'am.
Merle's no longer with us.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.665
Daryl gave us those--
his brother.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.549
Not sure I'd call
him a friend.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.553
He is today. This doxycycline
might have just saved your life.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.089
You know what Merle
was taking it for?

24:36.267 --> 24:37.973
The clap.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.931
Um, venereal disease.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.016
That's what Daryl said.

24:43.191 --> 24:46.274
I'd say Merle Dixon's clap was the best
thing to ever happen to you.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.685
I'm really trying
not to think about that.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.716
Are you praying?

25:19.727 --> 25:22.309
Why do you sneak up
on people so much?

25:22.480 --> 25:24.721
You're easy to sneak up on.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.232
l was praying.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.564
l was trying to.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.150
You religious?
You pray a lot?

25:33.324 --> 25:36.942
Actually this was
my first try.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.280
Eve r?

25:39.372 --> 25:41.203
Wow. Sorry.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.456
I didn't mean to wreck
your first time.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.787
God probably got the gist.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.578
- Praying for what?
- My friends.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.338
Looks like they could all
use a little help right now.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.633
You think--

26:00.810 --> 26:03.142
| always took it on faith.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.724
Lately I've wondered.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.059
Everything that's happened,

26:08.234 --> 26:10.145
there must have been a lot
of praying going on.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.561
It seems quite a few
went unanswered.

26:14.991 --> 26:17.107
Thanks.
This is really helping.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.742
Sorry.
Go ahead.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.164
Really.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.496
You gonna watch?

26:32.425 --> 26:34.962
I'll get you
a refill instead.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.092
I know it's not my business,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.181
and feel free
to believe in God,

26:46.355 --> 26:49.643
but the thing is you've got
to make it okay somehow

26:49.817 --> 26:52.900
no matter what happens.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.951
Before it happened

27:41.118 --> 27:44.485
we were standing there
in the woods

27:44.664 --> 27:47.997
and this deer

27:48.167 --> 27:50.374
just crossed
right in front of us.

27:50.545 --> 27:54.163
I swear, itjust
planted itself there

27:54.340 --> 27:57.582
and looked Carl
right in the eye.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.547
And I looked at Carl

28:00.721 --> 28:03.758
looking at that deer, and that deer
looking right back at Carl.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.673
And that momentjust...

28:05.852 --> 28:08.389
(sighs)

28:12.233 --> 28:14.599
slipped away.

28:14.777 --> 28:17.268
lt slipped away.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.564
That's what he was talking
about when he woke up,

28:23.286 --> 28:25.072
not about getting shot

28:25.246 --> 28:27.783
or what happened
at the church.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.039
He talked about
something beautiful,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.747
something living.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.958
There's still a life for us,

28:37.133 --> 28:39.624
a place maybe like this.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.589
It isn't all death
out there.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.175
It can't be.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.885
We just have to be
strong enough

28:47.059 --> 28:50.426
after everything we've seen
to still believe that.

28:50.605 --> 28:54.223
Why is it better for Carl
to live even in this world?

28:56.527 --> 29:00.736
He talked about
the deer, Lori.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.148
He talked about
the deer.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.662
Shane:
Oh, shit.

29:09.832 --> 29:12.869
( both groan )

29:13.044 --> 29:16.002
Got to get to the street,
double back to the truck.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.413
- Look, we ain't gonna make it, okay?
- Got to try, man.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.707
- Come on, get up.
- You're gonna take these bags

29:20.885 --> 29:23.422
- and you're gonna go.
- I ain't leaving you behind.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.305
Okay.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.013
(growling)

29:31.187 --> 29:33.348
How many rounds
you got left?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.058
Four. You?

29:35.232 --> 29:37.314
Five and one in the pipe.

29:37.485 --> 29:40.227
(snarling, growling)

29:45.034 --> 29:47.400
(gunshot)

29:49.872 --> 29:51.612
(gunshot)

30:00.758 --> 30:04.125
He's still losing blood
faster than we can replace it.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.464
And with the swelling
in his abdomen

30:06.639 --> 30:08.504
we can't wait any longer

30:08.683 --> 30:10.639
or he'sjust going
to slip away.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.267
Now I need to know right now

30:13.437 --> 30:15.302
if you want me to do this,

30:15.481 --> 30:18.097
because I think your boy
is out of time.

30:20.695 --> 30:21.684
You have to make a choice.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.353
- A choice?
- A choice.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.865
You have to tell me
what it is.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.412
You have to
tell me what it is.

30:36.127 --> 30:37.788
We do it.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.836
Okay, get the corner
of that bed.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.551
Let's get the sheets
down, everybody.

30:50.725 --> 30:53.182
Get the IV bag
on the sheet.

30:53.352 --> 30:57.186
Okay, on three.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.348
One, two, three.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.706
Rick, Lori,

31:21.881 --> 31:24.042
you may want to step out.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.795
(truck approaching )

31:31.265 --> 31:33.130
Rick:
Oh, God.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.766
You stay here with him.

31:48.532 --> 31:51.274
- Carl?
- There's still a chance.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.571
Otis?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.407
No.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.716
We say nothing to Patricia.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.300
Not till after.
I need her.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.658
They kept blocking us
at every turn.

32:34.829 --> 32:37.161
We had nothing left.
We were down to 10 rounds.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.788
Then he said--
he said he'd cover me

32:39.959 --> 32:41.745
and that I should
keep going.

32:41.919 --> 32:44.331
So that's what I did.
I just...

32:44.505 --> 32:47.167
I kept going.
But |--

32:49.510 --> 32:52.798
I looked back and he--

32:57.309 --> 32:59.345
I tried.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.136
He wanted to make it right.

33:51.906 --> 33:54.443
Andrea. Wait.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.403
What do you want, Dale?

33:56.577 --> 33:58.989
To give you this.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.028
I care about you

34:01.207 --> 34:04.040
so I made a choice
for you-- choices.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.953
I know why I did it,
but this is not my gun.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.872
And the choices
that I made for you

34:11.050 --> 34:12.586
were not mine to make.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.935
But I can still ask,

34:22.102 --> 34:24.434
and this is not
to make you guilty

34:24.605 --> 34:27.392
or put me ahead of you,
but I can still ask,

34:29.109 --> 34:30.610
please...

34:31.987 --> 34:34.854
don't make me regret this.

34:38.494 --> 34:39.950
I'll take watch.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.613
So do you forgive me for--

34:47.419 --> 34:49.705
do you forgive me?

35:03.978 --> 35:07.436
I've known Otis
since I was a kid.

35:07.606 --> 35:11.144
He's run this farm
since before my mother died.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.413
Who else?

35:23.580 --> 35:26.367
Who'd you lose?

35:29.670 --> 35:32.127
You told me I had
to make it okay somehow.

35:33.757 --> 35:36.169
That's what you've been
trying to do, right?

35:36.343 --> 35:38.379
Which ones?

35:44.435 --> 35:46.266
Stepmother.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.018
Stepbrother.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.997
He seems to have
stabilized.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.999
( exhales )
Oh, God.

36:22.139 --> 36:24.346
I don't have words.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.677
I don't either.
Wish I did.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.057
How do | tell Patricia
about Otis?

36:34.985 --> 36:37.397
You go to Carl.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.775
I'll go with Hershel.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.928
( Patricia sobbing )

37:29.998 --> 37:32.705
(sobbing )

37:59.528 --> 38:01.564
Stay.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.768
The bathroom's upstairs.

38:42.946 --> 38:45.938
- I brought you some clothes.
- Thank you.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.732
They won't fit well.
They were Otis's.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.457
Shane:
How many rounds you got left?

39:42.631 --> 39:44.838
Otis:
Four. You?

39:45.008 --> 39:47.715
Shane:
Five and one in the pipe.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.673
( groans )
Come on.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.870
( panting )

40:41.106 --> 40:44.018
- Down to my last.
- Me, too.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.234
I'm sorry.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.617
- ( gunshot)
- ( screams)

40:52.784 --> 40:55.036
(growling)

40:56.747 --> 40:58.783
Will you give it-- ah!

40:58.957 --> 41:00.822
Give it!

41:01.001 --> 41:03.413
( Otis screaming )

41:08.675 --> 41:10.176
I'll kill you.

41:10.344 --> 41:12.926
( Shane screams )

41:22.022 --> 41:23.762
( screams )

41:25.233 --> 41:26.609
(gunshot)

41:33.116 --> 41:35.573
Let go of me!
Let go!

41:42.501 --> 41:45.117
( Otis screaming )

41:59.559 --> 42:01.811
( panting )

42:39.266 --> 42:42.258
(theme music playing )
