WEBVTT

00:21.166 --> 00:22.542
It's snowing outside.

00:24.041 --> 00:29.166
There is no
outside.
No yesterday.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.375
Promise?

00:32.458 --> 00:33.750
(male #1)
'Matthew!'

00:33.834 --> 00:35.125
'Matthew Adams!'

00:37.000 --> 00:38.208
It's my dad.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.000
Matthew Adams!

00:42.667 --> 00:43.875
Matthew!

00:43.959 --> 00:45.375
Matthew doesn't know you.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.000
I wanna see my son.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.291
He was an orphan
when I met him.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.542
Look, you son of a bitch,
I know what you do.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.959
And I, you.

00:53.041 --> 00:55.750
You're manipulating
a screwed-up kid.

00:55.834 --> 00:56.959
And who screwed him up?

00:57.041 --> 00:59.000
I demand to see him.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.250
Call to him.
He has free
will.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.792
Matthew!

01:07.875 --> 01:09.000
I want you to come home.

01:10.166 --> 01:12.041
Beth wants you to come home.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.208
Matthew!

01:21.458 --> 01:22.458
Matthew!

01:30.291 --> 01:33.000
He's got a new father now.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.959
Matthew and I were
only a year apart.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.667
People used to think
that we were twins.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.417
So what made
him join this group?

02:24.500 --> 02:27.000
- You mean cult.
- Okay.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.208
'After Matthew's first
year of college'

02:29.291 --> 02:31.583
our mother killed herself.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.959
Matthew kind
of drifted after
that.

02:34.041 --> 02:36.000
So he joined
this First Generation.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.542
- Cut off all ties?
- And this was '78.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.000
- Jonestown had just happened.
- Oh, the Kool-Aid?

02:41.083 --> 02:43.041
We were scared that they
were
going to do the same thing

02:43.125 --> 02:46.583
so we hired
this deprogrammer.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.750
Remember his name?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.208
Yeah. Bill Crawford.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.000
He got Matthew
to a motel room

02:51.083 --> 02:52.875
but two days
later he
escaped.

02:52.959 --> 02:55.375
While you were there?

02:55.458 --> 03:00.291
No. My dad and I left
him
alone with Crawford.

03:01.417 --> 03:04.291
The next morning
Matthew was on our porch

03:04.375 --> 03:06.041
dead from cyanide.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.333
Suicide?

03:07.417 --> 03:09.583
Well, that's what we
thought
for all of these years.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.834
I mean, there
was even a note

03:10.917 --> 03:14.500
but then I saw this.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.750
Crawford's still
in business, huh?

03:18.834 --> 03:20.583
Last week he was working
with a girl who died

03:20.667 --> 03:22.583
of an asthma attack.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.750
I mean, he tried to cover it up
and make it look like a suicide.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.083
(Lilly)
'How'd he do that?'

03:27.166 --> 03:30.041
Dosed her with
poison,
forged a note.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.166
- And said she escaped?
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.500
Like your brother
supposedly did.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.125
We never should have
left him alone with that
man.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.125
Anna Mayes.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.542
Can I..

03:53.667 --> 03:55.125
What's going on?

03:55.208 --> 03:56.625
My lieutenant sent me.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.625
Uh, we found a floater
this morning in the
Schuylkill.

03:59.709 --> 04:00.792
You call the up desk?

04:00.875 --> 04:02.959
No, I-I came to you 'cause, uh

04:03.041 --> 04:05.041
it's someone we know.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.333
It's Scotty's girl.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.000
Elisa?

05:02.625 --> 05:07.208
"Father, I'm free.
Goodbye, Matthew."

05:07.291 --> 05:08.709
Standard suicide note.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.333
Or not. The sister thinks

05:10.417 --> 05:11.959
maybe this
deprogrammer wrote it

05:12.041 --> 05:13.375
after Matthew died in his care.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.542
Deprogramming,
sketchy business.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.875
Hmm.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.834
What did the boss
want with Valens?

05:18.917 --> 05:20.000
Don't know.

05:20.083 --> 05:22.000
Got the 49
on this Matthew Adams?

05:22.083 --> 05:25.417
Yeah. Um, 20-years-old,
mainline kid

05:25.500 --> 05:29.583
was pre-med at Penn
for a year, then dropped out.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.208
Father was a surgeon, right?
He couldn't have liked that.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.750
Uh, especially when
Matthew dyed his hair black

05:34.834 --> 05:36.750
and started hanging out
at the Arsenal.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.417
- Arsenal?
- Punk spot.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.792
- Mohawks, slam dancing.
- 'Yeah.'

05:40.875 --> 05:43.083
Moves into that cult,
June of '78.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.834
After he died,
Vice stormed the place

05:44.917 --> 05:47.250
found a vial of cyanide
for every member.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.417
They were gonna pull
their own Jonestown.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.250
Him dying might
have stopped that.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.625
(Will)
'I remember those
First Generation nuts.'

05:53.709 --> 05:54.917
The leader was named Warfield.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.875
- What was he preaching?
- 'Erase the past.'

05:56.959 --> 05:59.917
Come start a new generation
with him as their father.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.458
Father Warfield's
in prison now. Chester.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.917
Deprogrammer's
our first stop.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.667
So what,
you give Anna my job?

06:11.750 --> 06:13.750
Bring me out here
to break the news?

06:13.834 --> 06:16.500
It's about
Elisa,
Scotty.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.834
Is she in trouble?

06:20.875 --> 06:25.041
They found her this
morning in the
Schuylkill.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.083
Found her?

06:26.166 --> 06:28.458
Yeah, looks like she jumped.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.750
No, that can't be.

06:33.834 --> 06:34.959
I'm sorry, Scotty.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.417
No, 'cause she wouldn't.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
I spoke to
Manny Fernandez at west.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.208
He's got Anna working the case.

06:40.291 --> 06:43.667
Well, then I gotta
talk to Anna, 'cause..

06:47.041 --> 06:50.458
Well, she's scared of
heights,
and she was getting better.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.291
Yeah, I know.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.291
I'm gonna walk.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.166
Still working
while you're on
bail?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.667
Why shouldn't I work?
I'm no threat.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.291
Till this last time.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.667
It was an accident.

07:23.750 --> 07:27.125
You dosed her
with strychnine accidentally?

07:27.208 --> 07:28.792
You remember Matthew Adams?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.041
Yeah, I remember every job.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.709
You have an accident
with him too?

07:31.792 --> 07:33.166
Use cyanide to
cover your
tracks?

07:33.250 --> 07:35.625
- Off by a mile, lady.
- 'Things go wrong.'

07:35.709 --> 07:38.917
'78, deprogramming
was just being
invented.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.583
Look, that kid, he crawled
outta
bathroom window of the motel.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.458
I never saw him again.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.000
You're obviously not above

07:46.083 --> 07:48.291
breaking a few laws
to get your work done.

07:48.375 --> 07:51.417
If somebody you loved was hold
up with David Koresh in Waco

07:51.500 --> 07:52.667
wouldn't you want me
to get him out before

07:52.750 --> 07:55.625
the feds lit that place up?

07:55.709 --> 07:58.542
- Tell us about Matthew.
- 'It was like every job.'

07:58.625 --> 07:59.625
Started with a rescue.

07:59.709 --> 08:01.208
You mean a kidnapping.

08:01.291 --> 08:03.625
Look, man,
I was the good guys.

08:10.542 --> 08:11.917
Matthew Adams?

08:17.500 --> 08:18.959
Matthew Adams!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.083
Get him!

08:21.166 --> 08:23.875
There's no Matthew Adams here.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.959
Now!

08:28.041 --> 08:29.750
Or Charlie Manson here gets it.

08:35.625 --> 08:36.709
Door!

08:42.458 --> 08:44.208
- Matty!
- What's going on?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.250
- We're here to help.
- 'Son, listen to me--'

08:46.333 --> 08:47.417
(Matthew)
'I'm not your son.'

08:47.500 --> 08:48.750
Tell him.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.250
Your name is Matthew.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.083
You live at 1020--

08:52.166 --> 08:54.291
In three days, it's zero hour.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.083
And everything
will be wiped away.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.083
More. More!

08:58.166 --> 09:00.208
You love the Sixers
but you cheer for the Knicks

09:00.291 --> 09:01.667
just to piss off dad.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.166
Matt, please look at me.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.875
Your sister's
talking to you!

09:09.959 --> 09:12.041
Three days till zero hour.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.458
No more talking. Shh.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.291
What was zero hour?

09:18.375 --> 09:20.792
It was the cult's plan
for mass suicide.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.458
But Matthew died two days later.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.125
Why kill himself a day early?

09:24.208 --> 09:27.083
Maybe so we wouldn't stop him.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.917
Look, I got
a 90% success rate.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.709
That Warfield character

09:31.792 --> 09:33.834
he really messed up
that kid's head.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.834
Maurice Warfield, Detectives
Rush and Jeffries, Homicide.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.667
Ah, the faces of the law.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.083
So serious.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.667
Desperate to hide
that you're the same scared

09:55.750 --> 09:57.667
children you always were.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.250
We're here about Matthew Adams.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.166
Lived with you, 1978?

10:04.250 --> 10:05.542
He was an artist.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.458
His father tried
to fill his head with
science.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.834
And you tried to convince
him you were his father.

10:10.917 --> 10:14.083
All I ever did to Matthew
was suggest he had a choice.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.834
There's nothing
criminal about that.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.333
Tax fraud and statutory rape
are another story.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.583
Well, now,
those are your
laws.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.709
Not yours?

10:21.792 --> 10:23.667
I don't accept your authority.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.834
I consider myself
wrongly detained.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.959
Just a misunderstood man
spreading a good word.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.333
- Amen.
- And the good word was?

10:31.417 --> 10:35.375
That you can erase your past,
choose your family.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.083
Take you as a father.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.166
I love children.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.500
Probably sounded
good to Matthew.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.250
How'd you find him?

10:42.333 --> 10:45.625
Like you found
any lost soul in 1978.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.000
In a lost place.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.250
Hey.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.875
Do I know you?

11:58.959 --> 12:01.625
No. But I know you.

12:01.709 --> 12:02.792
Really?

12:02.875 --> 12:07.500
A rebel boy in combat boots
and Gucci socks.

12:07.583 --> 12:08.709
Poor little rich kid.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.709
You don't know
anything about me.

12:10.792 --> 12:14.125
I stole your thunder,
not letting them finish.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.834
You wanted to get
your ass kicked.

12:16.917 --> 12:19.417
- Why would I want that?
- World's full of pain.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.166
You want to control
how you get hurt.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.792
But you can't.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.625
Screw you, man.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.125
Okay.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.959
Maurice sees things in people.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.667
Right.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.542
Like what?

12:44.875 --> 12:48.500
And he needed a place to crash,
so he came home with us.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.917
How does he end up dead?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.959
Ask the commando who came
in and held a gun on me.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.166
He took Matthew away.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.875
I never saw him again.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.667
But you know
he died from cyanide.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.709
I heard that.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.709
Which you had
stashed at the cult

13:02.792 --> 13:04.333
prepping for
your mass suicide.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.291
Don't believe the ghost stories.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.667
There was no suicide plan.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.750
- No?
- There wasn't even a cult.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.458
Just an ideal.

13:14.542 --> 13:15.500
And now?

13:15.583 --> 13:17.959
The First Generation is a..

13:18.041 --> 13:19.959
...thing of the past.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.625
Frannie looked
over the
autopsy.

13:24.709 --> 13:26.458
Says Matthew had
abrasions on his
back

13:26.542 --> 13:28.125
might've come
from being dragged.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.083
If someone moved him, it goes
from a suicide to homicide.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.542
Maybe the deprogrammer?

13:33.625 --> 13:36.375
Uh, Crawford hopped a plane
to Miami that night.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.750
Records back it up.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.959
Oh, Crawford's
in the clear, boss.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.542
Bad news.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.667
Scotty's girlfriend.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.667
They found her body
in the river this morning.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.083
Where is he?

13:57.166 --> 13:58.458
Home.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.583
We got to go there.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.542
He needs time, Lill.

14:04.625 --> 14:05.875
Alone.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.625
Yeah, it's what he wants.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.625
Anything?

15:05.709 --> 15:07.917
Uh..

15:08.000 --> 15:09.834
One lift, from the window.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.166
Run it through
AFIS tonight.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.834
Yeah.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.959
For a thing of the past
the First Generation

15:16.041 --> 15:17.458
sure is organized.

15:17.542 --> 15:21.291
Warfield got word
to the outside nice and
quick.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.500
Must be still running
the cult from prison.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.208
So who's his man
on the outside?

15:25.291 --> 15:26.834
We'll check visitor
logs tomorrow

15:26.917 --> 15:29.625
see who he had contact with
after we left.

15:29.709 --> 15:33.959
You got nice neighbors
but they didn't see squat.

15:34.041 --> 15:37.250
Warfield told us about two
other
members, Nick and Alison.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.083
(Lilly)
'We got a date with them
in the morning.'

15:39.166 --> 15:40.542
What's wrong with these cats?

15:42.458 --> 15:43.500
Nothing.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.875
You okay?

15:52.959 --> 15:54.834
Scotty.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.166
Yeah.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.792
Hey, Scotty.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.333
I'm real sorry.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.917
I told Elisa's mom
I'd pick up her
stuff.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.917
Oh, yeah. 'Course.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.417
You got the scene photos?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.834
Not yet.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.417
'Cause, uh, I want to see 'em.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.208
No reason for that.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.583
I want to see 'em, Anna.

16:42.667 --> 16:46.166
There was a note,
addressed to you.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.625
I'm supposed to hang on
to it but I got a copy.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.583
Where was it?

16:52.667 --> 16:54.333
On her bed.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.917
Hey, if you want to talk..

16:59.000 --> 17:00.250
I got to jet.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.583
I wanna help you, Scotty.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.917
I'm good.

17:15.041 --> 17:18.667
So, Nick, you were Maurice's
muscle back in the day.

17:18.750 --> 17:22.000
I washed myself clean of
Maurice Warfield 25 years ago.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.959
Well, Someone's keeping
the cult alive.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.709
- Any ideas?
- Sorry.

17:25.792 --> 17:28.041
I've baptized myself
in the name of the Lord.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.709
Thought you two
were as thick as thieves.

17:29.792 --> 17:31.125
For a time.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.583
Anyone in the cult
have a reason to hurt Matthew?

17:33.667 --> 17:35.625
No one but Warfield himself.

17:35.709 --> 17:36.959
(Nick)
'Why's that?'

17:37.041 --> 17:39.709
False Gods can be wrathful.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.291
We don't speak cult.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.375
Matthew crossed him.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.041
After his three days.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.125
- Three days?
- 'Initiation rite.'

17:47.208 --> 17:49.250
Spend three days
in total darkness.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.625
Sounds fun.

17:50.709 --> 17:53.417
Matthew came out knowing
just what he wanted.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.542
- Son?
- I was..

18:13.625 --> 18:15.875
I was so alone in the dark.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.583
You don't have to be.
Not anymore.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.834
I-I
remember,
all of it.

18:20.917 --> 18:23.959
No memories, no past, no pain.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.625
You can let
all that go now.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.625
I can?

18:29.709 --> 18:30.875
Come on.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.375
Matthew..

18:44.458 --> 18:47.542
...we want you
to stay here with
us.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.792
If you want.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.041
(Matthew)
'Really?'

18:52.083 --> 18:54.542
Will you stay?

18:54.625 --> 18:56.750
Let us show you
what a family
is.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.166
What love is.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.333
I want that.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.709
Choose someone.

19:02.792 --> 19:03.875
'Anyone.'

19:05.583 --> 19:07.500
To love.

19:07.583 --> 19:08.667
Uh..

19:10.083 --> 19:11.625
Alison.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.208
Alison, come on.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.792
Is it okay?

19:22.875 --> 19:24.542
Matthew's chosen you.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.208
I love you.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.834
And she loves you.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.792
You'll be together one month.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.250
No more.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.458
You understand?

19:40.917 --> 19:42.083
I understand.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.583
(Nick)
'So, this Alison was
Warfield's squeeze?'

19:49.667 --> 19:51.083
But Matthew wanted that.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.625
- They obey the one month rule?
- 'No.'

19:54.709 --> 19:55.750
They fell in love.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.959
So you're saying
Warfield offed Matthew

19:58.041 --> 20:00.583
because he was banging her
past the cult expiration
date?

20:00.667 --> 20:04.083
I'm saying he
defied
Maurice.

20:04.166 --> 20:07.709
And Maurice did not
like to be defied.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.458
Nice shop. You own it?

20:19.542 --> 20:21.083
All the designs are mine.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.583
I work for myself.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.583
You still think
about Matthew?

20:24.667 --> 20:26.417
The love of your life
gets snatched at gunpoint

20:26.500 --> 20:28.792
and you never
lay eyes on him again.

20:28.875 --> 20:29.959
What do you think?

20:30.041 --> 20:32.083
We heard you were
Maurice's girl.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.667
He had a lot of girls.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.792
Any chance
you were special?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.959
He didn't like Matthew
choosing you?

20:38.041 --> 20:40.792
No. It was more
important to
Maurice

20:40.875 --> 20:43.417
to be a father
figure
than anything
else.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.166
So when your month
with Matthew was up?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.709
Maurice said we
could stay
together.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.709
Any idea who's keeping
the cult going for Maurice
now?

20:50.792 --> 20:54.166
No, he had a lot of
sway
over a lot of people.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.834
Guy could make you follow
him into a burning house.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.208
How'd he get you?

20:59.291 --> 21:01.834
I was at the end
of a bad
marriage.

21:01.917 --> 21:04.000
He made me feel special.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.500
Alison,
how do you get out

21:05.583 --> 21:08.083
from underneath
someone like him?

21:08.166 --> 21:11.834
For me,
it was when Matthew
died.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.542
Biggest loss of my life.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.542
You think Matthew
killed himself?

21:15.625 --> 21:18.000
Oh, we were all
pretty messed
up.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.750
What if we told
you now it was a homicide?

21:20.834 --> 21:22.709
I..

21:22.792 --> 21:25.458
I guess I'd ask if
you've looked at his
dad.

21:26.583 --> 21:27.959
Why?

21:30.959 --> 21:33.917
I spent two summers here as
a lab tech, built character.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.500
Ah!

21:38.583 --> 21:42.917
Methyl iodide,
thallium, cyanide.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.083
Dr. Boyle said she saw you.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.667
I thought maybe
you came to talk.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.041
We ran out of things
to talk about a long time
ago.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.500
Then what are you doing here?

21:58.583 --> 22:00.166
You'll find out.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.542
Looking for narcotics?

22:01.625 --> 22:03.208
Why, 'cause I must be
a dope fiend, right?

22:03.291 --> 22:04.542
Baby, let's go.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.458
- Is she one of them?
- She loves me.

22:06.542 --> 22:09.959
Those zombies are
controlling your mind,
Matthew.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.166
No.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.166
That's your specialty.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.917
You're just like your mother.
A total headcase.

22:17.375 --> 22:18.583
Don't talk about her.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.917
You take after her
in all the worst ways.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.917
I will never
forget the
secret.

22:32.667 --> 22:33.667
The secret?

22:33.750 --> 22:35.959
I don't know what it was.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.959
But Matthew hated
his dad for it.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.500
And with
everything
going down..

22:40.583 --> 22:42.458
What was going down?

22:42.542 --> 22:44.250
Maurice had a plan.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.041
Zero hour.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.250
The suicide?

22:49.333 --> 22:51.542
- That's not what it was.
- Then what?

22:51.625 --> 22:54.083
It was gonna be
the ultimate loyalty to
Maurice.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.125
We were all gonna kill
our fathers.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.792
(Will)
So, zero hour wasn't
mass suicide?

23:10.875 --> 23:12.458
Mass patricide.

23:12.542 --> 23:15.083
30 vials of cyanide
for 30 dads.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.583
So then our boy Matthew
was going to kill the
surgeon?

23:17.667 --> 23:19.166
Maybe the dad knew
what was going down

23:19.250 --> 23:20.458
beat him to the punch.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.834
(John)
'The timing's suspicious.'

23:21.917 --> 23:23.500
The day before
he's targeted to die.

23:23.583 --> 23:26.417
Or maybe it has to do with
the secret Matthew mentioned.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.834
Prints are back
on your window.

23:27.917 --> 23:30.250
Whoever broke in
ain't in the system.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.417
We get a
list
of the
visitors

23:31.500 --> 23:32.792
authorized to see Maurice?

23:32.875 --> 23:34.500
Yeah. It's long.

23:34.583 --> 23:36.166
He's got that many
blood relatives?

23:36.250 --> 23:39.333
Turns out he fathered a fair
amount of kids in his day.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.250
(Nick)
'Every cult you ever read
about'

23:41.333 --> 23:43.500
the leader's doing
all the ladies.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.083
- It's good to be king.
- Hmm.

23:45.166 --> 23:48.625
Talk to the dad. See if he
had
advance word on zero hour.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.166
The sister's here.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.166
(Beth)
'Matthew wouldn't do that.'

24:02.250 --> 24:05.500
It's what they were
planning.
I'm sorry.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.000
I mean, he and my dad
had their problems but--

24:08.083 --> 24:10.750
Matthew wasn't himself.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.834
Why couldn't I reach him?

24:12.917 --> 24:17.166
His girlfriend said
something
about the secret.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.083
He told her that?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.333
No details.

24:22.750 --> 24:26.500
My father wanted things
the way he wanted them.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.709
When Matthew was pre-med,
everything was great.

24:28.792 --> 24:32.250
Hmm. And when
he dropped out?

24:32.333 --> 24:34.625
Dad blamed mom.

24:34.709 --> 24:37.125
They fought.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.375
It was ugly.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.291
So was the secret about her?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.542
When you work at
the lab this
summer

24:45.625 --> 24:47.709
all that garbage
has to come off.

24:47.792 --> 24:51.500
Well, maybe I'm not working
at the lab this summer.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.458
What's that?

24:53.542 --> 24:55.166
My friend Sonnet needs
an apprentice

24:55.250 --> 24:58.041
to stretch canvases
and mix paint.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.625
Your friend, the pot head?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.125
Med schools
aren't
really impressed

25:04.208 --> 25:07.417
with mixing paint all summer.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.125
I dropped out of Penn.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.500
And I'm applying for art school.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.375
Did you know about this?

25:19.166 --> 25:20.583
- It's what he wants.
you

25:20.667 --> 25:21.917
I want him to be happy.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.417
Maybe he can end up
a pill popper.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.333
Dad, Matthew is a great artist.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.083
You know what?
Just, uh, forget
it.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.750
I'll go to med school.

25:32.834 --> 25:35.583
You know, if I'm so awful,
why don't I just kill myself?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.083
You're drunk again.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.583
- This time, I'll do it. I will.
- You're embarrassing yourself.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.083
- I will. I will kill
myself!
- Then do it already!

25:42.166 --> 25:43.417
Otherwise, shut up.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.125
Forget them.
You're going to art school.

25:58.583 --> 26:02.750
I'll find a quiet place
in the middle of
nowhere.

26:02.834 --> 26:04.125
That's where I'll go.

26:05.709 --> 26:07.125
Can I come?

26:14.417 --> 26:17.625
When the police came..

26:17.709 --> 26:20.333
...he made us say
that we all saw it.

26:20.417 --> 26:22.333
Hmm.
But only he
did.

26:22.417 --> 26:24.458
That's why Matthew
hated him so much.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.375
But not you?

26:26.458 --> 26:28.500
I was the good girl.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.458
I went to medical school.

26:30.542 --> 26:31.959
Tried to forget.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.500
But I never did.

26:35.583 --> 26:37.500
Do you think
your
dad killed her?

26:38.875 --> 26:40.500
I don't think so.

26:44.458 --> 26:46.291
I don't know.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.291
I didn't want
my family's ugliness exposed.

26:58.375 --> 27:01.750
Maybe you didn't want anyone
checking the prints on the
gun.

27:01.834 --> 27:04.333
My wife's death
was ruled a suicide.

27:04.417 --> 27:05.667
So was Matthew's.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.834
Lucky man, aren't I?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.792
Two of my three family members
checked out on me.

27:10.875 --> 27:13.125
Did you know your son
was planning to kill
you?

27:15.417 --> 27:17.500
- No.
- Kinda suspicious.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.667
Matthew dying
saved your
life.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.208
I tried to save my son,
not kill him.

27:22.291 --> 27:24.291
How about your wife?
Did you kill her?

27:25.917 --> 27:29.792
I watched my wife
shoot herself in the face.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.041
That almost killed me.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.083
Okay.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.709
'As for Matthew..'

27:34.792 --> 27:37.583
...have you ever looked into
the eyes of someone you loved

27:37.667 --> 27:41.083
and realized
the person you know is gone?

27:43.458 --> 27:44.917
Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.166
At what point
do you give up?

27:49.667 --> 27:52.667
I know you're there, Matty.
That you hear me.

27:53.709 --> 27:57.000
You've been at this
for 40 hours.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.750
Why don't you
let me take
over?

27:58.834 --> 28:00.709
My father will rescue me.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.208
You won't win.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.583
That man, Matty,
he's just like dad!

28:05.667 --> 28:09.000
'They both want to control
you,
tell you how to live!'

28:10.750 --> 28:13.125
You promised me
you wouldn't let that happen.

28:15.333 --> 28:16.542
Remember?

28:16.625 --> 28:17.959
That quiet place?

28:18.041 --> 28:20.083
In the middle of nowhere?

28:20.875 --> 28:22.375
E-enough, Beth.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.625
I know you remember.

29:00.083 --> 29:02.458
Hey, hey, where do you think
you're going?

29:02.542 --> 29:04.500
Home, to my father.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.417
Oh, Matthew.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.083
Why wasn't
I ever good enough?

29:10.792 --> 29:13.458
You hated me because
I was like mom.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.041
No.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.583
You killed her.

29:16.667 --> 29:20.625
Matthew, what do
you want from me?

29:20.709 --> 29:22.458
I want to forget you.

29:23.834 --> 29:27.250
I don't want
to feel bad
anymore.

29:32.917 --> 29:34.875
Okay.

29:34.959 --> 29:36.792
You win.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.250
It's your life.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.083
Get in.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.125
I'll take you wherever
you wanna go.

29:47.834 --> 29:49.500
I'm a surgeon.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.417
I know when I've lost a patient.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.875
Where'd you take him?

29:52.959 --> 29:54.333
'Back to that place.'

29:54.417 --> 29:57.834
He got out of the car,
never looked back.

29:57.917 --> 30:01.625
So, you saw him walk back into
the cult the night he died?

30:01.709 --> 30:05.542
And I saw that man Warfield
welcome him back.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.875
You never told your
daughter about this?

30:09.291 --> 30:11.709
She'd hate me.

30:11.792 --> 30:15.000
And I couldn't afford
to lose anyone else.

30:21.917 --> 30:23.333
Scotty.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.000
I got your message.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.208
Couldn't get
back.
Sorry.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.792
I've been worried
about you.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.667
I been with her family.

30:31.750 --> 30:34.041
What can I do to help?

30:34.125 --> 30:37.083
Well, tell me where
we are on this job.

30:37.166 --> 30:40.667
Maybe you shouldn't
be here right now.

30:40.750 --> 30:44.041
Then you tell me.
where I should be.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.625
Thought you could
break into my house?

30:51.709 --> 30:54.542
- Chase me away, Maurice?
- I didn't break in anywhere.

30:54.625 --> 30:57.458
Oh, we know you're still
running a game on the outside.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.667
We also know about
the patricide.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.667
Patricide?
Now, last time you said

31:02.750 --> 31:06.250
<i>suicide.</i>
Which one is it?

31:06.333 --> 31:10.500
Well, you said you never saw
Matthew after the kidnapping.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.083
But he came back,
two days later.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.125
- Says who?
- His dad.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.125
That doesn't mean
I killed him.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.041
Add to that, your
deputy
Nick fingered you.

31:20.125 --> 31:22.041
Nick did?

31:22.125 --> 31:24.750
Oh, I see what he's doing.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.917
Nick is the keeper
of my congregation.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.166
Thought the cult
was dead.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.917
He's supposed to
lead
until I get out

31:35.000 --> 31:38.750
but I guess he sees a chance
to keep me locked up forever.

31:38.834 --> 31:40.625
So Matthew came back..

31:40.709 --> 31:42.500
And we were all thrilled.

31:43.917 --> 31:45.542
Except Nick.

31:45.625 --> 31:46.542
How come?

31:46.625 --> 31:48.417
Because with Matthew gone

31:48.500 --> 31:51.041
he could try to get
his wife back.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.959
His wife?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.625
Alison.

31:54.709 --> 31:56.333
Alison and Nick
were married?

31:56.417 --> 31:59.500
And Nick did not
like sharing her.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.125
You saying
he killed Matthew?

32:01.208 --> 32:03.834
I know they said it was
a suicide, but nah.

32:03.917 --> 32:05.834
Suicide's for cowards.

32:05.917 --> 32:08.375
Matthew was brave.

32:08.458 --> 32:09.834
Talk more about that.

32:09.917 --> 32:12.291
What? The suicide?

32:12.375 --> 32:14.291
- Hmm.
-'Well..'

32:14.375 --> 32:17.709
Uh, "It's a screw
you
to the world.

32:17.792 --> 32:19.667
"I never really
loved
any of you."

32:19.750 --> 32:20.875
Is that right?

32:20.959 --> 32:22.250
- Forget it, Scotty.
- No, no, no.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.417
What else does it prove?

32:23.500 --> 32:26.166
Defective
thinking.
Narcissism.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.500
Keep going.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.959
And that your so-called
loved ones have failed.

32:30.041 --> 32:31.375
Scotty!

32:31.458 --> 32:33.083
Talk to me!

32:36.458 --> 32:37.709
Keep talking!

32:49.625 --> 32:51.542
So it was Valens
in the woodshed?

32:51.625 --> 32:53.500
Boss said he'd
keep it in-house.

32:53.583 --> 32:55.500
Keep it
out of IA's hands.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.709
It's true about
Nick Logan's congregation.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.458
Check it out.
This is a list

32:59.542 --> 33:01.542
of family allowed
to visit Maurice.

33:01.625 --> 33:04.041
These are the members
of Logan's church.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.500
Same list.

33:05.583 --> 33:09.333
So Logan's the number two
in charge till Maurice gets
out.

33:09.417 --> 33:11.542
(Nick)
'But he figures if Maurice
stays in for murder'

33:11.625 --> 33:12.709
he'll be number one.

33:12.792 --> 33:14.542
Classic power struggle.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.750
Whatever happened to
old-fashioned cult loyalty?

33:18.333 --> 33:21.750
I'll talk to Alison,
see how possessive hubby was.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.041
Let's go back to the preacher.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.125
(John)
'Hey Scotty.'

33:33.208 --> 33:34.625
Hey.

33:37.458 --> 33:43.041
I, uh, snapped out,
I know. Sorry.

33:43.125 --> 33:44.500
Well, most people
wouldn't
try to come back

33:44.583 --> 33:47.834
two days after
something like
this.

33:47.917 --> 33:50.417
I ain't most people.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.542
Yeah.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.250
It won't happen again.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.834
I need your gun, Scotty.

33:56.208 --> 33:59.125
Just for a little while.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.917
You want my badge too?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.917
No, the badge is yours.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.834
Elisa was in
a lot of pain,
Scotty.

34:24.917 --> 34:28.917
It wasn't suicide
what happened.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.333
Wasn't there a note?

34:30.417 --> 34:32.625
But it wasn't like that.

34:32.709 --> 34:37.542
I mean, if
she...jumped or something

34:37.625 --> 34:41.333
it'd be more apologizing
that she couldn't make it.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.041
Well, what did she say?

34:43.125 --> 34:46.834
It was about the good stuff
when we were kids.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.834
Scotty, sometimes that's
how people say goodbye.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.625
No, no.

34:56.709 --> 35:01.083
She wrote about this, uh,
this birthday party

35:01.166 --> 35:04.041
her friend turning 14,
and how we're both there

35:04.125 --> 35:07.500
sneaking looks, and talking
about how the river smells

35:07.583 --> 35:08.834
and how in her head

35:08.917 --> 35:10.375
she's waiting for
the light to fade

35:10.458 --> 35:14.000
so that I could
hold her hand..

35:14.083 --> 35:16.208
...in the dark..

35:16.291 --> 35:18.125
...and no one would see.

35:21.834 --> 35:25.250
Don't tell me that note
is the end.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.375
It's the beginning.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.542
I should get back.

35:44.458 --> 35:45.709
Yeah.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.166
(Will)
'Turns out you're just
watching over'

36:06.250 --> 36:08.417
Maurice's flock until
he's released, Nick.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.333
I'm a minister
to 100 people.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.333
You're a stand-in
for a psychopath.

36:12.417 --> 36:13.917
It's my congregation.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.083
They look to me,
not Maurice.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.000
He told us about Alison.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.458
Must've hurt.

36:19.542 --> 36:21.000
Some guy slipping
it
to the wife

36:21.083 --> 36:22.875
in front of your face.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.792
Maurice let them
be together.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.041
That why you killed
Matthew, over her?

36:28.125 --> 36:29.375
I didn't kill anyone.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.709
Guy gets kidnapped

36:30.792 --> 36:32.500
you figure,
this is my chance

36:32.583 --> 36:34.166
to slide back in
with the missus.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.667
But the kid's back
two days later.

36:35.750 --> 36:36.875
Ruins everything.

36:36.959 --> 36:39.250
It made me angry.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.625
But I didn't kill him.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.500
Then who did?

36:42.583 --> 36:44.709
The real psychopath.

37:03.542 --> 37:04.750
Who's that man?

37:09.000 --> 37:09.959
No one.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.208
Welcome home, son.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.917
Baby, you came back.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.291
They took him away
to brainwash him.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.458
We have to know
if they got to him.

37:20.542 --> 37:24.000
He came back.
He's pure.

37:24.083 --> 37:27.333
I-I'm ready for tomorrow.
Zero hour.

37:27.417 --> 37:28.458
I've never been more ready.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.041
We have to be sure.

37:33.083 --> 37:36.041
Go upstairs
and wait for her.

37:41.709 --> 37:42.959
Nick's right.

37:43.041 --> 37:44.667
If he's tainted,
he could ruin the
plan.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.792
I'm in charge of zero hour.

37:46.875 --> 37:49.166
Let me decide if he's okay.

37:49.250 --> 37:50.583
And if he's not?

37:53.750 --> 37:56.458
It'll be the biggest loss
of my life.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.917
(Will)
'Alison was in charge
of zero hour?'

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
Maurice gives her all
the important assignments.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.542
Gives?
Present tense?

38:15.500 --> 38:17.291
She's diehard, like him.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.458
(Alison)
Nick and I got married
when I was 18.

38:21.542 --> 38:23.250
'Smart, right?'

38:23.333 --> 38:24.625
(Lilly)
'How long did it last?'

38:24.709 --> 38:26.750
(Alison)
'Oh, less than a year.'

38:26.834 --> 38:28.709
I was all too glad
to forget our past

38:28.792 --> 38:30.375
when we met Maurice.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.083
Was Nick the jealous type?

38:34.166 --> 38:35.333
Why do you ask?

38:35.417 --> 38:36.959
It takes a lot of rage

38:37.041 --> 38:39.083
to dump a kid's body on
his father's doorstep.

38:39.166 --> 38:40.667
Unthinkable.

38:42.291 --> 38:45.417
We know Matthew made it back
to the cult that night.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.792
No.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.542
I would have seen him.

38:49.625 --> 38:51.125
His father drove him there.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.417
Is it too hot?

39:08.500 --> 39:11.750
No, but I could
use
some honey.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.291
Sure.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.875
Hands behind your head.

39:18.959 --> 39:20.500
This is a mistake.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.500
On your knees.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.417
All your own designs, right?

39:29.458 --> 39:31.750
You got it, Rush?

39:31.834 --> 39:34.083
She's the one who
broke
into my apartment.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.750
More than that.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.250
She killed Matthew.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.792
- You can't prove that.
- You had the cyanide.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.417
'Promised to kill him if
the outside got into his
head.'

39:42.500 --> 39:44.125
Poor Matthew.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.625
His sister ruined him.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.709
She got through.

39:49.792 --> 39:51.792
I had no choice.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.041
I thought I'd lost you.

40:06.125 --> 40:07.667
You'll never lose me.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.250
So you're ready
for zero hour?

40:09.333 --> 40:11.959
That's why I came back.
We have to get outta here.

40:12.792 --> 40:13.959
What?

40:14.041 --> 40:17.917
What Maurice wants
us to do, it's
crazy.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.166
They got to you.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.208
Baby, he wants us
to kill people.

40:21.291 --> 40:23.542
We're wiping out the past.

40:23.625 --> 40:25.333
We can't do that.

40:26.583 --> 40:27.750
But we can move on.

40:27.834 --> 40:30.166
To a quiet place
in the middle of nowhere.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.750
Just me, you, my sister.

40:34.458 --> 40:37.917
So we'll go to the police.
We'll tell them about zero
hour.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.458
And then, uh, we're free.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.583
Does your family know
you're doing this?

40:44.667 --> 40:47.834
My dad drove me here, we didn't
say a word the whole drive.

40:50.917 --> 40:54.333
- Baby, we gotta hurry.
- Okay. Okay, but..

40:54.417 --> 40:56.667
We can't just run away.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.959
We have to leave Maurice a note.

40:59.041 --> 41:01.000
Okay, yeah, fine.
Whatever.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.667
Just write.

41:02.750 --> 41:06.333
"Father, I'm free.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.750
"Goodbye."

41:12.291 --> 41:13.750
Sign it.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.959
I don't need a father anymore.

41:21.542 --> 41:24.125
Just you.

41:24.208 --> 41:25.500
Do you feel it yet?

41:33.542 --> 41:35.375
It'll just be a minute now.

41:36.959 --> 41:37.959
Alison..

41:39.208 --> 41:42.542
I'll leave you
on his doorstep.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.166
I came back to save you.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.750
And I'm saving you.
