01:02.913 --> 01:04.051
<i>When I was nine,</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.559
<i>my sister took me
to the Shrine of Masumeh.</i>

01:09.419 --> 01:11.057
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

01:12.589 --> 01:14.660
<i>But I'll never forget
the smell.</i>

01:16.393 --> 01:18.236
<i>A mix of sweat,
and the rosewater</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:20.239
<i>they showered down
on the faithful.</i>

01:23.900 --> 01:26.244
<i>I used to think
only the most pious</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:27.906
<i>carried that sent.</i>

02:57.594 --> 02:58.937
Mazi jaan...

02:59.663 --> 03:01.336
Mazi jaan...
Mmm.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.603
Wake up.

03:03.366 --> 03:05.676
These men want
to talk with you.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.607
Get up, sir.
And get dressed.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
We are here now.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.588
Hi. Hi.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.891
Would you like
to come back tomorrow?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.724
It is a bit of a mess.
It is my childhood room so...

03:58.488 --> 04:00.399
No?

04:04.761 --> 04:05.831
No.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.230
Take some.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.172
We don't want to impose.

04:13.069 --> 04:14.343
You come with the sunrise,

04:14.404 --> 04:16.077
you go through
my son's belongings,

04:16.172 --> 04:18.675
and you say you
don't want to impose?

04:18.742 --> 04:20.688
Put on your scarf, madam.

04:21.577 --> 04:22.852
Do I provoke you?

04:23.013 --> 04:24.287
Mother, mother...

04:24.681 --> 04:25.751
Uh...

04:29.019 --> 04:30.862
Why do you have so many films?

04:31.288 --> 04:33.199
Because I've always
liked watching them.

04:33.423 --> 04:35.425
I've been watching them
since I was a kid.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.595
What is this?

04:36.927 --> 04:38.372
This is porno?

04:38.962 --> 04:41.704
No. No, no.
It is an Italian film.

04:41.765 --> 04:42.971
Uh, an art film.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.376
This is porno.
No.

04:45.468 --> 04:46.776
Do you know about this?

04:46.937 --> 04:48.712
Sir,
she doesn't know.

04:49.105 --> 04:50.778
It is an art film from Italy.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.217
What is this?

04:52.275 --> 04:54.448
Next time you see <i>my</i> face,

04:54.544 --> 04:55.579
<i>show some respect.</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:56.713
<i>I</i> will.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.724
<i>You motherfucker!</i>

05:01.785 --> 05:03.230
You shot <i>my</i> foot!

05:03.386 --> 05:05.229
<i>The Sopranos.
Porno.</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:07.724
<i>Sopranos.</i>

05:07.791 --> 05:08.792
Porno.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.903
Leonard Cohen?

05:12.329 --> 05:13.330
Amazing!

05:13.496 --> 05:14.474
Right?

05:14.564 --> 05:16.635
It's beautiful, but ominous.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
Keep it.
I got it for you.

05:23.173 --> 05:24.982
It's just some music.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.487
Jewish? Porno? Porno?
Tintin.

05:29.312 --> 05:30.484
Porno?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.250
Yes. Could be. Yes.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.758
What...
What does this say?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.328
I don't know.
You don't know?

05:39.422 --> 05:40.492
No, it's in German.
I don't know.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.270
But it's from your room
and you don't know?

05:42.359 --> 05:44.999
Yeah, but it's
my late father's.

05:45.862 --> 05:47.500
God bless him.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.042
Confiscate this.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.176
Please.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.718
You know if you can't
reach me at the office,

06:32.809 --> 06:34.049
you can always call my sister.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.145
Yes.

06:35.245 --> 06:37.054
And you have
her work number?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.558
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.491
And if I can't
reach you?

06:42.719 --> 06:43.993
Sorry.

06:45.221 --> 06:47.064
I'm going to miss you.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.236
We have to make
the extra cash, no?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.067
I know.
Yeah.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.073
With this guy coming in here.

06:55.065 --> 06:57.102
It's crazy how, like,
you're one month pregnant

06:57.233 --> 06:58.906
and you're already like this.
Go away.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.177
Hey. Ah, I felt it.

07:07.277 --> 07:08.517
Yeah?

07:09.279 --> 07:10.849
I think so. Yes.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.191
What do you want from us?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.291
Do you come in peace?

07:22.759 --> 07:24.363
It's just one week.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.705
There is great anticipation

07:27.764 --> 07:30.301
<i>in the run-up to
Iran's presidential election</i>

07:30.400 --> 07:32.778
<i>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
the hardline incumbent,</i>

07:32.869 --> 07:35.110
<i>is no longer
the guaranteed victor.</i>

07:35.205 --> 07:36.445
<i>His opponent, the more moderate</i>

07:36.473 --> 07:39.113
<i>Mir-Hussein Mousavi,
has been gaining quickly</i>

07:39.209 --> 07:41.621
<i>and could be poised
for an historic upset.</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:45.056
<i>But Ahmadinejad's student
organizer Alireza Abkar</i>

07:45.148 --> 07:46.218
<i>still believes.</i>

07:46.282 --> 07:49.229
<i>So-called Western
democracy is corrupt</i>

07:49.719 --> 07:51.960
<i>because it reflects
only the will of the people.</i>

07:52.222 --> 07:53.633
<i>Why the Iranian state
is superior?</i>

07:53.723 --> 07:55.396
<i>Well, where do I begin?</i>

07:55.658 --> 07:58.730
<i>We have</i> a <i>big, huge backing
of Ali Khamenei,</i>

07:58.895 --> 08:01.398
<i>and he supports
Ahmadinejad's motives.</i>

08:01.664 --> 08:03.644
<i>He understands
it's an Islamic state,</i>

08:03.733 --> 08:06.236
<i>not a corrupt,
Westernized environment</i>

08:06.302 --> 08:07.804
<i>which Mousavi would like.</i>

08:08.238 --> 08:09.740
Kids today.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.078
Right?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.251
I'd love for you
to reconnect with him

08:13.343 --> 08:14.754
now that the elections
are upon us.

08:14.811 --> 08:16.654
You think he'll still
want to talk?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.590
Yes, I mean, if I bring
him some Maltesers,

08:19.649 --> 08:21.151
he will talk.

08:21.351 --> 08:23.262
Allah is no match
for London chocolates.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.089
It's not funny.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.424
I'm sorry?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.592
It's pathetic.

08:29.859 --> 08:31.861
Ahmadinejad or whoever,

08:32.028 --> 08:33.308
they take these
poor street kids,

08:33.328 --> 08:34.672
who've got nothing,

08:34.764 --> 08:36.835
give them food
or sweets or whatever.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.345
Indoctrinate them
to spout this gibberish.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.437
It's pathetic,
and that's the real story

08:41.504 --> 08:43.279
we should be doing.

08:43.706 --> 08:45.185
He's from here.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.181
Sorry?

08:47.844 --> 08:49.517
Alireza, he's from here.

08:50.013 --> 08:51.788
He's an Iranian Brit.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.888
He was born and raised here.
He's educated.

08:55.685 --> 08:57.460
He doesn't need the chocolates.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.863
He just misses them.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.630
Well, off we go.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.564
Yeah.

09:05.862 --> 09:06.863
Let's go.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.405
Thanks, Bobby.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.472
Remember Lindsey Hilsum's
out there

09:16.573 --> 09:17.551
if you need anything
from Channel 4.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.880
Okay.
Cool.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.318
All right.

09:24.881 --> 09:27.487
<i>I was last in Iran
three months ago</i>

09:27.584 --> 09:29.495
<i>for my sister's funeral.</i>

09:30.220 --> 09:31.893
<i>Her name was Maryam.</i>

09:31.988 --> 09:33.661
<i>She was my heart.</i>

09:34.657 --> 09:35.658
<i>I followed her</i>

09:35.758 --> 09:37.328
<i>to every film, museum</i>

09:37.393 --> 09:39.395
<i>and concert
she would take me to.</i>

09:41.331 --> 09:42.503
<i>In 1980,</i>

09:42.599 --> 09:44.909
<i>she was arrested
by the Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

09:45.568 --> 09:48.242
<i>Six years in prison
for being a communist.</i>

09:48.338 --> 09:49.908
<i>Six years!</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:51.349
<i>Mazi...</i>

09:53.676 --> 09:57.021
<i>Maryam was following
the footsteps of my father.</i>

09:57.080 --> 10:00.186
<i>My father Baba Akbar
had been jailed by the Shah</i>

10:00.750 --> 10:02.423
<i>for the same offense.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:05.431
<i>Of course,
he gave them nothing;.</i>

10:05.521 --> 10:07.592
<i>I</i> gave them nothing.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.760
<i>He never broke.</i>

10:08.925 --> 10:09.965
<i>I never</i> broke.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.633
<i>I miss</i> them both.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.059
Please turn off the computers.

10:42.325 --> 10:44.066
See you later.
See you later.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.581
Ah! Ah! Welcome, sir.
Hey, hey.

11:04.647 --> 11:06.320
Come, come. Let me take this from you.
Come. Come.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.759
Thanks to God I came along,

11:07.817 --> 11:08.989
you could have been stuck
here for hours, huh?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.086
Hey, hey.
No, no, no.

11:10.153 --> 11:11.353
He's a personal friend of mine.

11:11.354 --> 11:12.424
I've come to get him.

11:12.522 --> 11:15.002
Don't listen to him.
A brand new car for you.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.593
Freshly painted, huh!

11:16.693 --> 11:18.331
You can relax.
I'm from here.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.930
It's fine.
Ah.

11:20.863 --> 11:21.933
Welcome home.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.705
<i>Okay.</i>

11:27.203 --> 11:29.205
I see you have
a Mousavi poster.

11:29.672 --> 11:30.673
Yes, it helps.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.548
It doesn't let in the sunlight.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.185
What do you like about him?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.280
Uh, he isn't Ahmadinejad.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.855
He's getting a lot
of attention now.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.521
Do you think it's only
because of who he isn't?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.297
Uh, may I ask,

11:46.356 --> 11:49.132
are you here for, uh,
business or pleasure?

11:49.192 --> 11:51.798
Or perhaps pleasure's
bitter rival, family?

11:51.861 --> 11:53.363
No, I'm a journalist

11:53.463 --> 11:55.465
I'm covering the elections
for Newsweek magazine.

11:55.531 --> 11:56.976
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.739
And I'm also
visiting my mother.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.314
Uh, I meant no disrespect.
No problem.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.140
I think
Mousavi is honest.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.583
Well,
maybe he's not.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.486
<i>Tell Newsweek,
tell the whole world,</i>

12:08.544 --> 12:10.148
if Mousavi fails us,

12:10.213 --> 12:11.853
it's okay, we will find
someone who won't.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.589
I see you're in
the satellite business.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.925
Sir, satellite dishes
are illegal

12:21.324 --> 12:22.735
and I shouldn't have
to remind you

12:22.825 --> 12:25.499
we live in a lawful
and devout society.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.066
Do you need one?

12:28.398 --> 12:29.502
VPNs?

12:29.599 --> 12:31.738
Information access here
is very fragile.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.246
No' I'm very happy
with my satellite service.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.717
But I am in the market
for a responsible driver.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.422
What kind of, uh,
vacation benefits package

12:42.512 --> 12:44.082
are you offering
with this position?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.181
Absolutely none.

12:46.115 --> 12:47.685
Okay.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.258
Yeah, I'll do it.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.593
Yeah?
Yeah.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.688
Great.

12:54.257 --> 12:56.134
You sold it to me.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.028
Davood.
Davood.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.660
<i>Mazijoon!</i>

13:23.119 --> 13:24.291
How are you, Moloojoon?

13:24.387 --> 13:25.388
Good, good.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.296
Did you sleep on the plane?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.336
Well, relatively.

13:29.459 --> 13:32.065
I'll make you baghali
ghatogh for your lunch.

13:32.628 --> 13:34.403
You'll need to eat
<i>as</i> much as you can

13:34.464 --> 13:37.308
before reporting
on all this ashghal.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.741
Moloojoon, come on.
You can't be this cynical.

13:40.837 --> 13:41.907
What?

13:41.971 --> 13:43.746
Mom, tomorrow is the election.

13:43.806 --> 13:45.649
Surely you'll be standing
with the people.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.085
Don't tease me.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.416
Yeah.

13:49.512 --> 13:50.991
I had a very persuasive cabbie.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.924
He is very excited about this

13:53.983 --> 13:56.259
"not Ahmadinejad."

13:57.353 --> 14:00.163
Who knows, maybe this time
it will be different, right?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.258
Garbage doesn't pick itself up.

14:02.325 --> 14:04.771
If the people don't,
then who will?

14:05.595 --> 14:07.268
You sound like Maryam.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.271
And you sound like Babe.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.183
It's good to see you.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.784
Have you washed your hands?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.523
In the plane.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.025
Go wash it.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.190
Go wash your hands.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.854
Go, go, go. Go.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.965
<i>You slept well, huh?</i>

14:39.195 --> 14:40.196
Yep.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.038
Come. Would the
kind gentleman

14:43.466 --> 14:44.968
like the window
or the aisle seat?

14:45.034 --> 14:47.310
Oh, no. No. No. What is this?
Where is your cab?

14:47.570 --> 14:49.049
I don't have a cab.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.209
What did we ride
in this morning?

14:51.307 --> 14:53.480
Oh, yeah, that. Oh, that
was my friend's cab.

14:53.543 --> 14:55.887
He was sick.
He said I could use it.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.821
I never said I had a cab.

14:59.048 --> 15:00.220
Okay. Are you sure?

15:00.383 --> 15:01.555
Yeah. This...

15:01.651 --> 15:02.994
Even if I had a cab,

15:03.052 --> 15:04.998
it's not the way to get around this city.
Trust me, man.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.157
You can't get anywhere.
Okay. Okay.

15:06.222 --> 15:07.667
With this...  You
get where you want to go,

15:07.723 --> 15:08.827
quick, you know.
Yeah, yeah.

15:08.891 --> 15:10.336
All right.
Yeah?

15:10.393 --> 15:11.736
Okay. You take it?

15:11.827 --> 15:12.897
Yeah, yeah.
Hold this? I'm fine.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.565
Sure? Okay.
Yeah.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.575
And you're gonna
look good on this, huh.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.167
Okay!

15:33.349 --> 15:35.260
Oh, by the way, I brought you

15:35.351 --> 15:37.763
these good friends
of yours from London.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.191
Chocolates!
Mmm-hmm.

15:39.255 --> 15:41.132
You're very kind.
No problem.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.295
No problem.

15:43.426 --> 15:45.201
Uh, Davood,
turn that off, please.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.304
Okay,

15:50.266 --> 15:51.540
So tell me,

15:52.468 --> 15:54.069
there's recently been
a lot of talk about

15:54.103 --> 15:55.446
Mousavi's strength.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.778
Is it something
that surprises you?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.874
Is it something you expected?

15:59.275 --> 16:01.619
Mousavi is, uh, corrupt

16:01.944 --> 16:03.116
Like many of the founders,

16:03.212 --> 16:06.284
<i>he has forgotten the
lessons of the revolution.</i>

16:07.149 --> 16:08.822
It is easy
to fall off the path.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.788
But he has
his supporters, right?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.627
Some academics,

16:13.389 --> 16:14.493
some dead-enders.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.465
Well, Mousavi
says that Ahmadinejad

16:18.561 --> 16:20.802
is not his main concern
in the election

16:20.896 --> 16:22.466
but the election itself.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.908
They think that the vote
might be rigged.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.744
That there might be
some manipulation...

16:26.836 --> 16:28.076
Who says this?

16:28.137 --> 16:31.243
Oh, people in the street.
Journalists, clerics...

16:31.307 --> 16:33.412
Please, stop.

16:33.843 --> 16:34.913
This is all nonsense.

16:35.344 --> 16:36.414
Rumors and lies

16:36.512 --> 16:39.152
that enemies of Iran
would like us to believe.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.591
To weaken us.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.160
I'm surprised, Mr. Bahari,

16:43.252 --> 16:46.995
that a sophisticated person
would fall for this.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.002
What about an
unsophisticated person?

16:50.593 --> 16:51.697
Hmm.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.375
Ahmadinejad is devoted
to the Supreme Leader.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.206
You see, we are not
a nation, Mr. Bahari,

17:00.770 --> 17:03.444
we are the Ummah,
the Islamic nation.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.949
We obey the commands
of the Supreme Leader,

17:06.041 --> 17:08.214
and the Supreme Leader
determines all.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.288
Ahmadinejad understands this,

17:11.881 --> 17:13.519
Mousavi does not.

17:14.349 --> 17:16.522
Ahmadinejad is what must be.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.626
And are you going
to watch the debate tonight?

17:21.557 --> 17:23.867
We'll have it on,
but, uh, as I said,

17:23.959 --> 17:25.700
there is still much to be done.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.967
Good.

17:27.063 --> 17:29.043
"This is what
must be, Maziar.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.042
"This is what must be."

17:31.133 --> 17:33.636
Oh, man, that guy!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.911
Who talks like that?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.216
I can't believe
he let you film it.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.550
Why not? He's a poster boy
for the Supreme Leader.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.547
What's he got to be afraid of?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.489
Looking like
an ignorant asshole.

17:45.548 --> 17:46.822
He's not alone, you know.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.222
Yeah. Neither am I.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.990
Just because you can't
see the cockroaches

17:50.052 --> 17:51.156
doesn't mean
they are not there.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.660
Come on, Davood, let's go...

17:53.823 --> 17:54.995
Uh, uh...
Patience, brother.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.900
Listen, you're a
reporter' right?

17:56.992 --> 17:58.994
Don't you want to
report the other side?

17:59.095 --> 18:00.438
I'll take you to it.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.675
Where are we going?

18:02.765 --> 18:03.903
Huh?

18:03.999 --> 18:05.672
Where are we going?

18:05.735 --> 18:07.180
To a dead end.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.009
Come.

18:55.885 --> 18:56.886
Hamid.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.558
Cyrus.
Maziar.

19:02.658 --> 19:03.898
Cyrus.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.131
Maziar. Hey.
Hi.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.228
So you are a reporter?

19:06.328 --> 19:07.398
Yes.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.803
You've come to the margins

19:08.898 --> 19:10.400
to find out what
the animals think?

19:11.333 --> 19:12.641
We don't have to use the
camera if you don't want.

19:12.735 --> 19:13.975
No, no, no.
You can film.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.241
Yes? Sure?
Yeah.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.318
You don't have to
tell me your names, okay?

19:19.508 --> 19:21.146
Hamid Javilli.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.083
<i>Cyrus.</i>

19:24.146 --> 19:26.990
<i>And, uh, who are
you guys gonna vote for?</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:28.117
Mousavi.

19:28.184 --> 19:29.288
Why?

19:29.485 --> 19:32.091
Because we are a great people,
a great civilization,

19:32.188 --> 19:34.228
and we deserve a president
that's equal to our past.

19:34.657 --> 19:36.830
They say that Mousavi is
gonna cut the relief funds.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.206
Do you think
that's gonna happen?

19:38.360 --> 19:39.771
I don't care.

19:39.862 --> 19:41.022
You wanna talk to my brother?

19:41.664 --> 19:45.612
Ahmadinejad gives them money
every month to smoke opium.

19:46.335 --> 19:47.507
<i>Opium.</i>

19:48.103 --> 19:49.776
<i>We don't want their money.</i>

19:49.839 --> 19:51.375
<i>We want a life.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:53.943
<i>We are {he educated.</i>

19:54.009 --> 19:55.682
<i>Only the uneducated
are the ones</i>

19:55.778 --> 19:57.348
<i>who vote for the dictator.</i>

19:57.446 --> 19:58.948
So you are students?
Uh...

19:59.014 --> 20:01.221
<i>We are the educated. Huh.</i>

20:01.550 --> 20:02.790
Come. Come.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.693
Okay. Come
on, we'll show you.

20:04.787 --> 20:05.788
Davood?
Yeah.

20:05.888 --> 20:07.799
You're in frame
every single time.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.968
My apologies for the
conditions, Mr. Bahari.

20:12.061 --> 20:13.301
It's okay.

20:13.395 --> 20:14.465
Yes, Hamid.

20:14.563 --> 20:16.133
When is this shithole
due for renovation, huh?

20:16.232 --> 20:18.041
<i>Uh, when you get laid maybe.</i>

20:18.133 --> 20:19.806
When I get laid?
Ask your sister.

20:19.902 --> 20:21.381
Oh, you wish!

20:21.470 --> 20:23.814
Mr. Bahari, welcome

20:24.740 --> 20:26.151
to Dish University!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.481
<i>The economy in Iran
is on the verge of collapse!</i>

20:28.978 --> 20:30.321
Novels are now censored

20:30.379 --> 20:32.154
<i>by the Ministry
of Islamic Guidance.</i>

20:33.883 --> 20:35.157
.. nuclear weapon

20:35.317 --> 20:36.597
<i>could unbalance
the whole region.</i>

20:37.887 --> 20:39.127
Mr. Bahari,
you can film.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.224
You can film.

20:41.257 --> 20:42.895
No, I ran out of battery.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.403
I'm sorry.
Oh, too bad.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.905
We are high up and
the satellites are low

20:46.996 --> 20:49.169
<i>so</i> no one can
see them from below.

20:49.231 --> 20:51.006
I see.
This is all Cyrus!

20:51.233 --> 20:52.576
Cyrus the Great!

20:53.836 --> 20:56.248
VPNs, filter busters...
Anything you want.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.848
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

20:57.940 --> 21:00.079
Uh, Grand Theft <i>Auto.</i>

21:00.175 --> 21:02.018
That's impressive.
Mmm.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.591
My sister doesn't even know
what your name is, Davood.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.854
Maziar, you're famous.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.963
Hello.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.860
Hi.

21:15.624 --> 21:17.194
Whoa!

21:18.127 --> 21:19.936
<i>All right,
let's go, Davood. Bye-bye!</i>

21:20.029 --> 21:21.099
Bye!

21:21.196 --> 21:22.266
Come on, Davood.
We are running late.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.434
Okay, guys.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.704
Come on.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.538
- Maziar. Maziar.
Bye-bye.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.378
Why don't you
stick around, huh?

21:30.439 --> 21:31.713
We're gonna fix some dinner.

21:31.774 --> 21:32.775
We're gonna watch the debates.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.115
We can't, we have to...
We have stuff...

21:34.209 --> 21:35.381
We'll come back.
No, we have stuff to do.

21:35.477 --> 21:37.388
I have an interview.
We'll be back.

21:37.947 --> 21:39.051
Hey, hey, hey-

21:39.315 --> 21:40.555
Next time.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.725
All right, let's work.
Let's work. Let's go.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.566
Great. Yeah,
I'm good. Okay.

21:49.992 --> 21:52.233
Um, all right. You set?

21:52.661 --> 21:53.799
Let's go.

21:54.463 --> 21:56.238
<i>So, as a spy, I'm just
trying to figure out</i>

21:56.298 --> 21:58.676
<i>why your country
is so terrifying;.</i>

21:59.068 --> 22:01.309
You know, the first thing
to know about Iran

22:01.403 --> 22:02.973
is that it is not evil.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.574
Actually, Americans
and Iranians

22:04.640 --> 22:06.142
have a lot of things in common,

22:06.241 --> 22:07.515
more than they
have differences.

22:07.643 --> 22:09.316
What do I have
in common with you?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.482
What is the number one enemy
of the United States?

22:11.580 --> 22:12.650
Al-Qaeda.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.024
AI-Qaeda is also the
number one enemy of Iran.

22:15.484 --> 22:17.327
<i>The Al-Qaeda members
say that</i>

22:17.419 --> 22:18.989
<i>I! you kit! an Iranian</i>

22:19.088 --> 22:20.590
<i>or if you kill</i> a <i>Shiite,</i>

22:20.656 --> 22:22.761
<i>you go to Heaven
and you get 72 virgins.</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:25.928
<i>Well, they won't be virgins
for too long, huh?</i>

22:26.428 --> 22:28.101
<i>Right? You know
what I'm saying?</i>

22:28.197 --> 22:29.437
<i>Upstairs.</i>

22:32.034 --> 22:33.274
I'm sorry.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.607
No, that was great.
That was really great.

22:34.703 --> 22:35.841
Sorry, sorry.
No, no, no' that was great!

22:35.938 --> 22:37.440
I know it's stupid.
I'm an idiot.

22:37.539 --> 22:39.280
Do you want to ask him
the "I'm a Jew" bit?

22:39.341 --> 22:40.445
You did
great though. Uh...

22:40.542 --> 22:41.782
Or "Are you
a terrorist?"

22:41.844 --> 22:43.790
Uh... Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.846 --> 22:45.018
Let's save the Jew bit
for outside.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.287
We'll do the terrorist thing.
That's, um...

22:47.349 --> 22:48.470
But no, that's great.
Just...

22:48.550 --> 22:50.860
- Just try to keep it straight.
- Okay, okay.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.455
And, uh,
I'm the asshole.

22:52.521 --> 22:53.522
All right.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.192
<i>So, yeah. So, one
more quick question.</i>

22:55.290 --> 22:56.462
<i>Are you a terrorist?</i>

22:56.859 --> 22:57.860
<i>No.</i>

22:58.027 --> 23:00.064
<i>That sounds like something
a terrorist would say.</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:04.672
<i>That was good?
Okay. Yeah, that was great.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:09.646
Hey.

23:09.705 --> 23:11.150
What the hell was that?

23:11.206 --> 23:13.379
It's a TV show.
It's supposed to be funny.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.218
Ah, I thought he was,
uh, crazy, you know.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.985
Yeah.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.834
Vodka refreshment?

23:34.997 --> 23:36.101
No. Thank you.

23:36.732 --> 23:38.177
You are a pious man?

23:38.233 --> 23:39.610
I am a whiskey man.

23:39.735 --> 23:40.736
To the Greens!

23:43.439 --> 23:45.680
You know,
Hamid is a good Muslim.

23:45.774 --> 23:47.754
He doesn't drink, he
doesn't have a girlfriend

23:47.843 --> 23:49.584
but he doesn't stop us
from going to hell either.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.419
Shut up, for God's sake!

23:51.513 --> 23:52.685
Watch.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.025
A fraud? The wife?

24:00.722 --> 24:01.928
Why would he
go so low?

24:02.024 --> 24:04.026
No. This is as high
as he can reach.

24:04.126 --> 24:05.537
I think he's afraid.

24:06.095 --> 24:07.438
I think he's scared.

24:18.574 --> 24:20.713
Yeah. Yes.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.951
He did well. He did well.
Yes. Yes.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.285
Our man.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.881
Our man did good.

24:29.651 --> 24:31.221
Mr. Bahari?
Yeah?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.956
Why did you put away
your camera

24:33.055 --> 24:34.728
when you saw the satellites?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.900
Look, I've been doing
this for many years.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.572
And there are
certain situations,

24:41.663 --> 24:43.074
that if you film them,

24:43.132 --> 24:45.738
it won't do your friends
or the movement any good.

24:46.335 --> 24:47.973
I know this regime very well.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.640
I know where the lines stand.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.309
Yeah, but if they are not
afraid, why are you?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.765
Hey, guys, come.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.202
It's the revolution, Maziar.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.939
We're going to win tomorrow!

25:31.180 --> 25:32.284
<i>Patna.</i>

25:32.614 --> 25:33.786
Hey.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.027
Hey, listen to this.
Listen to this. Listen.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.465
It's a
huge demonstration.

25:45.527 --> 25:47.404
They're incredible. Yeah?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.409
They just want to be heard.

25:51.733 --> 25:53.974
They just want to be heard.
They just want...

25:54.403 --> 25:56.576
They just want to be heard!

25:59.474 --> 26:01.147
Down, dictator!

26:01.810 --> 26:03.812
Maryam would be
so proud to see this.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.890
- To the Greens!
- To the Greens!

26:13.355 --> 26:14.857
Hey, Davood, I'm going inside.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.334
Sure.
Okay. I'm going inside.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.267
Hi. Hello. My credentials.
Hello.

26:19.361 --> 26:21.671
- Can you hold this? Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.166
Okay, you can go inside.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.403
Thank you.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.446
Not you.
You stay here.

26:27.936 --> 26:29.347
I'll be back.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.695
<i>I've been
talking to a source</i>

27:14.750 --> 27:16.286
<i>who says the Supreme Leader</i>

27:16.385 --> 27:18.888
<i>has had his own
private polling done.</i>

27:18.987 --> 27:21.467
<i>This suggests that
the main opposition candidate</i>

27:21.556 --> 27:23.229
<i>Mir-Hossein Mousavi</i>

27:23.292 --> 27:26.239
<i>is in the lead
in all but one province.</i>

27:56.858 --> 27:58.098
<i>Hello.
It's Alireza.</i>

27:58.193 --> 28:00.173
<i>Ahmadinejad has triumphed!
How?</i>

28:00.262 --> 28:01.263
<i>A landslide!</i>

28:01.430 --> 28:02.431
How would you know?

28:02.931 --> 28:04.342
The polls haven't closed yet.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.037
<i>Praise Allah!</i>

28:06.201 --> 28:08.340
<i>A great victory,
Mr. Bahari.</i>

28:15.110 --> 28:16.487
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.455
I am a journalist.
This is my accreditations.

28:19.514 --> 28:20.686
Who are you?
I'm supposed to be inside.

28:20.782 --> 28:21.954
What is this?
What are you doing?

28:22.017 --> 28:23.018
I'm a journalist.
This is my accreditation.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.290
It says that I'm
supposed to be inside.

28:24.386 --> 28:25.364
Your time is done.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.214
No, no. We are journalists.
We are allowed...

28:27.389 --> 28:28.959
Huh? He has the papers
in his hands.

28:29.024 --> 28:30.128
Now go. Leave!
You're done.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.362
Okay, okay.
We're leaving.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.461
Fine. Fine.

28:32.561 --> 28:34.131
Go, before I fuck both
your mothers in front of you.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.137
Hey, hey... No, no,
forget about it.

28:36.231 --> 28:38.575
Don't listen to him. Don't
listen to him. Come on.

28:49.044 --> 28:50.148
Okay. Let's go.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.550
The government has announced

28:52.647 --> 28:53.717
<i>that President Ahmadinejad</i>

28:53.815 --> 28:56.659
<i>has been re-elected
with 62.6% of the vote.</i>

28:56.752 --> 28:59.232
<i>The challenger,
Mir-Hossein Mousavi got...</i>

28:59.321 --> 29:00.994
Did he really win?

29:01.089 --> 29:02.659
<i>Two other candidates
got less than 1%,</i>

29:02.758 --> 29:03.759
They say.

29:04.393 --> 29:05.895
They've reported that Mousavi

29:05.994 --> 29:08.565
did not even carry
his place of birth.

29:09.431 --> 29:10.432
His home.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.003
How unpopular he must be.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.207
You'd think they would
have allowed him that.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.444
<i>That he saw himself</i>

29:19.541 --> 29:21.543
<i>as having strong momentum
going for him...</i>

29:27.682 --> 29:31.027
<i>Iran's Presidential election
is ending in controversy.</i>

29:31.086 --> 29:32.087
The opposition

29:32.187 --> 29:33.188
<i>has called it fraud.</i>

29:33.288 --> 29:36.269
<i>For the fourth day in a row,
a river of protesters</i>

29:36.358 --> 29:38.269
<i>stream through
the streets of Tehran.</i>

29:38.527 --> 29:41.474
These people
feel that their election

29:41.563 --> 29:43.099
has been stolen from them.

29:43.198 --> 29:47.806
This government won't allow
us to say what we want.

29:48.136 --> 29:50.047
We want freedom!

29:50.105 --> 29:52.949
We want freedom!

29:53.809 --> 29:54.947
<i>You said you'd stay
until the election.</i>

29:55.043 --> 29:56.044
I know.

29:56.111 --> 29:57.715
But the election is over.
I know. I know.

29:57.813 --> 30:00.054
<i>This isn't like you.
Lt's getting too dangerous.</i>

30:00.449 --> 30:02.451
I have to stay here, Paola.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.553
Khamenei is doing
the Friday prayers.

30:04.619 --> 30:05.825
Okay.
Uh-huh.

30:06.621 --> 30:07.622
<i>And?</i>

30:07.722 --> 30:09.292
You know, he never
does them himself.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.234
Or he rarely does them himself.

30:11.293 --> 30:13.068
And I think he's gonna
use this opportunity

30:13.128 --> 30:15.734
to bring some sense
into this and maybe,

30:15.797 --> 30:17.470
uh, validate people's concerns

30:17.566 --> 30:20.979
or, uh, talk about
a recount of the election.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.071
Because something special
is happening here...

30:23.138 --> 30:24.583
<i>Mazi, what are you
talking about?</i>

30:24.673 --> 30:27.483
<i>And stop moving around,
you're making me nauseous.</i>

30:27.576 --> 30:28.577
<i>Please.</i>

30:28.677 --> 30:29.985
Hmm.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.658
Okay. Okay, okay.

30:35.517 --> 30:36.757
I'm sorry.

30:36.818 --> 30:39.424
I will look into the
flights tomorrow, okay?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.328
All right?
Okay.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.663
And in the meantime,

30:42.757 --> 30:45.260
you and your round
friend down there below,

30:45.327 --> 30:48.001
okay, you go to sleep,
because it's getting late.

30:49.030 --> 30:50.338
<i>You're lying.</i>

30:50.432 --> 30:52.207
And you're beautiful.

30:57.672 --> 30:58.878
Ah...

30:59.708 --> 31:00.948
Good night.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.429
What's he saying, Maziar?

31:43.852 --> 31:46.025
He's saying that from now on,

31:46.087 --> 31:47.862
anyone that takes
to the streets

31:47.923 --> 31:49.425
is gonna be held accountable

31:49.524 --> 31:51.197
for all the violence,
all the blood

31:51.259 --> 31:53.500
and all the rioting
that occurs.

32:21.957 --> 32:23.157
<i> Do you think</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:25.193
<i>these demonstrations
will continue?</i>

32:26.294 --> 32:28.535
<i>Yeah. I</i> think so.

32:28.630 --> 32:31.543
<i>I think it's my responsibility.</i>

32:32.100 --> 32:34.808
<i>When I stay home,
I'm worried about other women,</i>

32:35.203 --> 32:37.444
<i>other boys that are here.</i>

32:37.539 --> 32:41.043
<i>And I think I should go,
maybe I can help them.</i>

32:56.891 --> 32:59.394
<i>I think I'm a little braver now.</i>

32:59.794 --> 33:01.569
<i>History has taught me</i>

33:01.630 --> 33:05.908
<i>that all the, uh,
revolutions start like this.</i>

33:07.836 --> 33:11.249
<i>Nothing stays
like this forever.</i>

33:20.081 --> 33:21.355
Mousavi!

34:30.585 --> 34:31.585
Hey, Davood!

34:31.985 --> 34:33.260
Wait, you're gonna get hurt!

34:33.353 --> 34:34.994
We have to fight back!
What are you doing?

34:35.023 --> 34:36.024
Fighting back!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.261
You're gonna
get killed! Come on.

34:37.358 --> 34:39.360
What do you want me to do, huh?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.295
They took my vote. I'm dirt to them.
I'm dust.

34:41.362 --> 34:43.000
It's not right.
It's not right, Davood.

34:43.098 --> 34:44.406
Ah, well, who are you to say?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.739
You have a real weapon and
you choose not to use it.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.434
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Sorry, no offense.

35:47.495 --> 35:48.599
None taken.

35:48.663 --> 35:49.664
God, Maziar,
have you shown this

35:49.764 --> 35:51.334
to anyone else?
No.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.308
Can we get this out tonight?
Have you got time?

35:54.402 --> 35:55.904
Hmm? Yeah,
no worries. Yep.

35:56.004 --> 35:57.506
<i>It'll</i> be in London
before 7:00.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.314
How do you want this credited?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.352
Ah...

36:01.442 --> 36:02.921
Uncredited.

36:04.179 --> 36:06.250
They probably already
know that you shot ii,

36:06.347 --> 36:07.668
because there's
cameras everywhere

36:07.749 --> 36:09.456
especially around
the Basij headquarters.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.120
I know. I know.

36:11.452 --> 36:13.955
Are you sure you
want to go ahead with this?

36:14.088 --> 36:15.089
Yes.

36:15.690 --> 36:17.260
This has to be seen.

37:09.744 --> 37:11.314
Mazi jaan...

37:11.646 --> 37:13.148
Mazi jaan...
Mmm.

37:13.414 --> 37:14.688
Wake up.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.853
These men want
to talk with you.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.824
Get up, sir.
And get dressed.

37:23.825 --> 37:24.860
We are here now.

37:37.605 --> 37:39.084
Turn to the left.

37:51.219 --> 37:52.721
Welcome to Abu Ghraib,

37:52.787 --> 37:54.926
or whatever you Americans
like to call it.

37:58.927 --> 38:00.907
Put your
blindfold back on.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.641
Your specialist will come
to claim you soon.

39:02.490 --> 39:03.628
Stand up.

39:03.691 --> 39:05.170
Stand up!

39:06.527 --> 39:08.200
Give me the names!

39:08.329 --> 39:10.036
Stand up.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.676
I don't know!
I swear, I don't know!

39:12.767 --> 39:14.940
All these lies, huh?

39:17.105 --> 39:18.345
All these lies!

39:18.473 --> 39:19.679
Fucking lies!

39:19.774 --> 39:21.879
I swear.
I swear. I don't know.

39:24.712 --> 39:26.988
I can see the fucking time,

39:27.048 --> 39:29.289
but they're giving me
all the rough cases.

39:30.151 --> 39:31.152
I know.

39:31.953 --> 39:35.196
But after this case,
everything will be different.

39:36.657 --> 39:38.000
Of course.

39:39.227 --> 39:41.229
Next time,
my love. Yes.

39:41.329 --> 39:44.833
I promise you. I promise you.
I promise you, yes.

39:44.899 --> 39:47.004
Of course I understand.

39:49.737 --> 39:50.977
I have to go now.

39:52.073 --> 39:54.349
See you, my love. Bye.

39:54.409 --> 39:55.649
Sorry, sir.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.646
Is everything okay?

39:57.979 --> 40:00.550
I very much want
this opportunity

40:00.648 --> 40:02.218
to work out for you, Javadi.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.991
Bahari is not some street thug.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.730
He will be well-prepared
intellectually.

40:07.822 --> 40:08.823
Of course.

40:08.890 --> 40:11.894
I've given you the
questions he must answer.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.234
But, Javadi, we must
have his confession!

40:14.328 --> 40:15.649
Do you understand?
Of course, sir.

40:16.264 --> 40:18.175
The people in
the streets must know

40:18.232 --> 40:21.611
how they have been
fooled by these traitors.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.076
We can end this,

40:23.204 --> 40:26.845
but we must show them how
their leaders have been

40:26.908 --> 40:30.014
receiving orders
from foreigners,

40:30.078 --> 40:32.888
Zionists and Jews in the West.

40:33.915 --> 40:36.225
They will listen
to him, Javadi.

40:37.552 --> 40:38.724
Yes, sir.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.763
And remember,

40:40.855 --> 40:43.301
we need his face
for the cameras.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.596
This will take much more
than just a fist, Javadi.

40:46.727 --> 40:48.035
Yes, sir.

42:02.870 --> 42:04.508
Salted cucumbers.

42:05.873 --> 42:07.443
You must be hungry.

42:08.709 --> 42:11.019
Thank you, sir.
I'm... I'm fine.

42:20.821 --> 42:22.892
It's salted cucumbers.
You must be hungry.

42:22.990 --> 42:24.697
Yes, yes.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.238
Yes. I'm gonna
have one.

42:34.001 --> 42:35.173
Sir...

42:36.003 --> 42:37.744
Can you tell me why I am here?

42:42.343 --> 42:44.482
Because if this is about
filming the demonstrations,

42:44.545 --> 42:46.149
I can assure you I am...
You can film.

42:46.214 --> 42:47.557
I'm fully accredited by
the Ministry of Culture...

42:47.648 --> 42:48.854
You can film.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.022
You know, it was just
so sudden. It was...

42:53.087 --> 42:55.829
The camera was there
and the violence erupted.

42:55.890 --> 42:57.995
But we have nothing to hide.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.067
So why then? Why?

43:09.237 --> 43:12.275
You are here because
that's what happens

43:12.373 --> 43:16.014
to foreign spies
caught on Iranian soil.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.190
Yes, we know you are a spy.

43:24.752 --> 43:26.595
A spy?
Yes.

43:28.789 --> 43:31.065
The game is over,
Mr. Bahari.

43:35.229 --> 43:37.266
And for who am l a spy?

43:42.370 --> 43:45.874
For CIA, MIG, Mossad,
Newsweek-You tell me.

43:46.774 --> 43:48.219
<i>Newsweek me magazine?</i>

43:48.442 --> 43:49.785
No, Newsweek the carpenter.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.413
The media arm for CIA.

43:52.246 --> 43:54.419
No, no, sir. No, no.

43:54.482 --> 43:56.462
I can only go by the evidence.

43:56.584 --> 43:58.996
Sir, you are making
a big mistake.

43:59.086 --> 44:00.156
I am a journalist

44:00.254 --> 44:01.631
That's it, nothing more.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.792
Just a journalist?

44:02.957 --> 44:04.095
Yes.

44:06.627 --> 44:08.072
As a spy, I'm just trying

44:08.129 --> 44:10.905
<i>to figure out why your
country is so terrifying.</i>

44:11.732 --> 44:13.473
<i>The first thing
to know about Iran</i>

44:13.567 --> 44:14.637
<i>is that it is not evil.</i>

44:14.735 --> 44:17.272
<i>Americans and Iranians have
a lot of things in common,</i>

44:17.338 --> 44:18.749
<i>more than they
have differences.</i>

44:18.806 --> 44:20.615
<i>What do I have
in common with you?</i>

44:20.741 --> 44:22.652
So can you tell me why...

44:22.743 --> 44:25.781
just a journalist will meet
up with this American spy

44:25.846 --> 44:27.018
on the eve of the unrest?

44:27.114 --> 44:28.684
He's not a spy.
He's not a spy?

44:28.816 --> 44:30.454
He's... No, it's a show.
It's a show?

44:30.518 --> 44:31.861
A comedy show.
It's stupid...

44:32.019 --> 44:33.362
It's very stupid, yes.

44:33.454 --> 44:36.128
He's a comedian
pretending to be a spy.

44:36.190 --> 44:37.828
So, can you tell me
why an American

44:37.925 --> 44:40.701
pretending to be a spy had
chosen to interview you?

44:41.829 --> 44:44.503
And why would a real spy
have a TV show?

44:49.103 --> 44:51.947
Why did you tell this man

44:52.006 --> 44:55.010
that America and Iran has
something in common?

44:55.543 --> 44:57.284
Was that funny, too?

45:00.181 --> 45:04.323
You know, Khamenei said that
America is the Great Satan.

45:05.686 --> 45:08.360
But maybe you don't
think that's right.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.791
Maybe we have been hasty.

45:13.027 --> 45:14.836
We kicked America
out of the door

45:14.895 --> 45:18.069
and you will bring them
back through the windows.

45:21.736 --> 45:23.010
No, sir.

45:23.838 --> 45:24.976
I...

45:25.339 --> 45:29.651
Speaking to a person from the
United States is not treason.

45:32.146 --> 45:36.219
Revolutions, just like people,
they have to grow up.

45:39.487 --> 45:40.761
Do they?

45:42.356 --> 45:44.165
You little spy.

46:10.418 --> 46:12.227
<i>It's all</i> a <i>show, Mazi.</i>

46:13.521 --> 46:15.023
<i>The blindfold.</i>

46:15.423 --> 46:16.800
<i>The shit food.</i>

46:17.458 --> 46:19.529
"Your specialist
is here."

46:21.028 --> 46:23.975
They are all putting on
a play for you, Mazi.

46:24.932 --> 46:26.912
They say I am a spy.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.457
<i>A spy!</i>

46:47.788 --> 46:49.631
You?... A spy ?

46:49.723 --> 46:52.226
Yes, I know. I know,
it sounds absurd.

46:52.793 --> 46:55.467
Well, it doesn't matter
what they think.

46:56.330 --> 46:57.434
You will tell them nothing.

46:57.598 --> 46:58.668
There's nothing to tell.

46:58.766 --> 46:59.801
So you'll say nothing.

46:59.900 --> 47:00.901
I can't just say nothing.

47:00.968 --> 47:02.777
You must. You will.

47:02.837 --> 47:05.147
Well, this has been
very helpful.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.116
Thank you for your counsel.

47:08.309 --> 47:10.585
I have nothing to tell them.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.521
Because I am not a spy.

47:14.782 --> 47:17.956
<i>You underestimate
them at your peril.</i>

47:18.919 --> 47:21.695
<i>They have learned much
since the days of the Shah.</i>

47:21.789 --> 47:23.166
Oh, my God.

47:23.524 --> 47:26.698
<i>They thought they could
break us with fists and feet.</i>

47:26.794 --> 47:29.138
<i>Belts and batons.</i>

47:29.997 --> 47:32.273
<i>They didn't know our strength.</i>

47:33.167 --> 47:36.148
If they use sticks,
you must be stone.

47:36.337 --> 47:39.477
If they use stone,
you must be steel.

47:39.974 --> 47:41.681
And if they use steel,

47:42.343 --> 47:44.789
I... I must
be titanium?

47:50.017 --> 47:51.462
<i>Yes, I'm sorry.</i>

47:52.019 --> 47:55.296
<i>I forgot all those years
you spent in prison.</i>

47:55.356 --> 47:57.893
<i>All that you've learned there.</i>

47:57.992 --> 48:00.563
<i>You were always
smarter than everyone.</i>

48:00.694 --> 48:02.901
<i>No one knows but you.</i>

48:04.331 --> 48:05.969
I am not being smart.

48:10.070 --> 48:12.380
I don't know if I can do this.

48:12.907 --> 48:14.318
You have to.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.851
I am not you nor Maryam.

48:18.913 --> 48:20.654
<i>No, no, no. Fuck 'em!</i>

48:20.981 --> 48:22.722
Fuck 'em in the eye!

48:24.151 --> 48:26.062
This is nothing, Maziar.

48:26.387 --> 48:28.526
They're a paper tiger, Maziar.

48:28.689 --> 48:29.861
Maziar...

48:31.158 --> 48:32.865
Mazi, look at me.

48:35.195 --> 48:36.572
<i>Look at me.</i>

48:38.933 --> 48:40.674
<i>Tell them nothing.</i>

48:44.438 --> 48:45.917
Why did you ask
the traitor Khatami

48:46.006 --> 48:47.451
if the election
could be rigged?

48:47.841 --> 48:50.913
<i>Who pays you
in America? The CIA?</i>

48:51.011 --> 48:53.218
<i>How</i> many <i>Jews
work for Newsweek?</i>

48:56.016 --> 48:57.791
Who is Anton Chekhov?

48:58.252 --> 49:00.630
Anton Chekov?
The playwright?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.261
Hey, you tell me.

49:02.356 --> 49:05.394
It is you who has listed an
interest of him on Facebook.

49:05.859 --> 49:06.860
Confess.

49:12.433 --> 49:14.106
Who else are you working for?

49:14.201 --> 49:16.044
Why do you write
so much to Bashiff?

49:18.606 --> 49:21.917
Three times you have visited
New Jersey, America,

49:21.976 --> 49:23.478
in the time before the unrest.

49:23.978 --> 49:24.979
Why?

49:25.079 --> 49:26.080
Confess.

49:26.146 --> 49:28.251
I have a very good
friend who lives there.

49:28.315 --> 49:30.317
You have friends in New Jersey?

49:30.417 --> 49:33.830
Yeah. My friend lives
there, what can I do?

49:36.056 --> 49:37.729
He likes it there.

50:26.540 --> 50:29.020
Apricot.
You want apricot?

50:29.843 --> 50:31.652
Yes.
Thank you, sir.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.989
Are we not friends?

50:37.785 --> 50:39.662
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

50:40.654 --> 50:42.656
So why do you insult me?

50:43.390 --> 50:44.391
Insult you?

50:44.625 --> 50:46.400
No, no, I would never...

50:46.493 --> 50:49.303
“Newsweek is an
internationally distributed

50:49.363 --> 50:52.572
"weekly magazine headquartered
in New York City.

50:52.666 --> 50:56.671
"It is privately owned and has
operated for over 70 years."

50:57.838 --> 50:59.249
This is a schoolboy report.

50:59.339 --> 51:02.252
Sir, that is the truth.
The truth is not an insult.

51:02.342 --> 51:03.912
The truth is you are a spy,

51:04.011 --> 51:05.752
working with the Americans
and the Zionists

51:05.846 --> 51:07.257
to destroy our holy system.

51:07.381 --> 51:09.657
I'm not a spy.
You are a spy.

51:09.717 --> 51:11.025
Yes.
No, no, no.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.425
The American
government doesn't

51:12.519 --> 51:14.089
control Newsweek magazine.

51:14.188 --> 51:16.395
To be honest, it's not even
worth controlling anymore.

51:16.523 --> 51:17.558
Is it?
Yes.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.537
Yes, it is. This weekly
model of magazines

51:20.594 --> 51:22.505
is completely outdated.
Outdated?

51:22.563 --> 51:24.702
There are better ways
of doing propaganda.

51:24.765 --> 51:27.678
Through the Internet.
In the blogs.

51:27.735 --> 51:29.715
Twitter. Uh...

51:29.770 --> 51:31.909
There's many things. The
game has changed completely.

51:32.005 --> 51:34.110
So this is just a crazy theory?

51:34.508 --> 51:35.953
It is a little bit misinformed.

51:36.043 --> 51:37.613
Are we paranoid?
You're not...

51:37.711 --> 51:39.247
Paranoid?
I didn't say that.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.087
Are we paranoid?

51:41.448 --> 51:44.019
Are we paranoid?

51:46.787 --> 51:47.925
Sir...

51:59.533 --> 52:01.274
How are you feeling?

52:02.402 --> 52:03.779
Like shit.

52:04.304 --> 52:06.409
I apologize for my colleague.

52:06.473 --> 52:09.886
He is enthusiastic,
but perhaps not

52:09.943 --> 52:12.617
as understanding of
the intellectual nuances.

52:15.115 --> 52:18.756
Your father was imprisoned
at one time, was he not?

52:19.787 --> 52:20.891
Yes.

52:20.954 --> 52:22.456
When was this?

52:23.423 --> 52:25.664
In 1953.

52:27.494 --> 52:29.997
He was accused
of being a communist.

52:30.330 --> 52:32.071
Yes.
Was he?

52:32.132 --> 52:34.339
He was a communist back then.

52:35.235 --> 52:37.647
On whose authority
was he detained?

52:38.939 --> 52:40.282
Under the Shah.

52:40.440 --> 52:41.817
Yes.

52:43.477 --> 52:46.117
The Shah of Iran.

52:47.815 --> 52:49.351
I'm sorry.

52:49.449 --> 52:51.861
That must have been
difficult for your family.

52:52.152 --> 52:53.688
Thank you, sir.

52:54.488 --> 52:56.365
But I thought at that time,

52:56.456 --> 52:59.437
Iran had a democratic leader.

53:01.094 --> 53:03.335
Mossadegh.
Mohammad Mossadegh.

53:03.630 --> 53:05.337
So there was a coup?

53:05.432 --> 53:07.503
Yes.
Organized by?

53:07.601 --> 53:09.444
The CIA. The
Americans, British...

53:09.503 --> 53:11.505
Operation Ajax
I believe it was called.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.346
The West wanted
the Iranian people's oil.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.441
Yes.

53:14.508 --> 53:17.148
And the journalists
and gangsters

53:17.211 --> 53:20.624
that were paid by the CIA to
spread lies and violence,

53:20.681 --> 53:23.719
and turn the Iranian people
against its government

53:23.817 --> 53:26.730
so the Americans
and Zionists could deploy

53:26.820 --> 53:31.565
their puppet the traitor,
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi...

53:31.692 --> 53:33.672
Yes, but that was
in those days, sir. I...

53:35.295 --> 53:37.070
But I am not a spy!

53:37.364 --> 53:40.573
Yes, Mr. Bahari,
this is history!

53:40.901 --> 53:44.405
We are not crazy.
This is not paranoia!

53:45.205 --> 53:48.152
Why did you meet
with these saboteurs

53:48.208 --> 53:49.983
in the months
leading to the unrest?

53:50.043 --> 53:52.148
Saboteurs?
They... They are

53:52.479 --> 53:55.323
normal people. They are not...
They are friends of mine.

53:55.382 --> 53:56.383
They are not saboteurs.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.588
You will tell me.

54:01.588 --> 54:03.431
Or they will tell me.

54:03.523 --> 54:05.503
- Oh, no.
- Seyyed!

54:05.692 --> 54:07.262
You have
the wrong people, sir.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.705
These are not...

54:24.578 --> 54:28.048
You must not just take
his blood, Javadi,

54:30.617 --> 54:32.688
you must take his hope.

54:32.953 --> 54:34.296
Yes, sir.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.759
Good morning, sir.

55:13.093 --> 55:14.163
Sir?

55:15.929 --> 55:18.933
I've been thinking,

55:18.999 --> 55:21.809
and I wanted to know
your opinion about, uh,

55:21.902 --> 55:24.678
how the Americans
do espionage these days.

55:27.307 --> 55:30.845
Is it very different from how
it used to be in the '50s?

55:31.979 --> 55:33.458
Is it?

55:36.450 --> 55:39.829
Because I might have been
tricked as well. I...

55:40.654 --> 55:43.760
I might have fallen into a trap.
I don't...

55:43.957 --> 55:46.198
How is your beloved
mother Moloojoon?

55:46.293 --> 55:48.295
She must be very worried.

55:54.101 --> 55:57.446
I... I don't know.
I think she's fine...

55:57.971 --> 55:59.109
Good.

56:02.109 --> 56:03.645
I'm surprised.

56:04.878 --> 56:07.017
She did not contact us.

56:09.016 --> 56:13.021
Normally a prisoner's family
can be very persistent.

56:14.988 --> 56:17.628
Visitors, lawyers...

56:18.558 --> 56:21.334
But for you,
there has been none.

56:23.563 --> 56:27.136
Is media espionage
a new field? Is it?

56:31.071 --> 56:33.073
You should call her soon.

56:34.875 --> 56:36.320
Poor woman.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.925
To lose her husband,
God rest his soul

56:42.516 --> 56:44.518
and to lose her daughter,

56:45.719 --> 56:47.164
Maryam.

56:49.890 --> 56:51.597
And now this.

56:54.995 --> 56:56.599
Let's call her.

56:58.432 --> 57:00.275
You want to call her?

57:01.334 --> 57:03.336
Do you want to call her?

57:06.173 --> 57:07.277
Yes.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.112
Good.

57:20.454 --> 57:21.797
Call her.

57:46.546 --> 57:47.889
No answer?

57:49.082 --> 57:50.720
Strange.

58:11.238 --> 58:13.514
From now on, I am your mother.

58:14.441 --> 58:15.681
And father.

58:15.775 --> 58:16.981
Family!

58:22.115 --> 58:25.528
It is time to do this
right, Mazi jaan.

58:28.788 --> 58:31.598
You must sign your confession.

58:32.926 --> 58:33.996
Hmm?

58:39.432 --> 58:40.536
You know,

58:41.268 --> 58:43.373
everything can be forgiven.

58:45.005 --> 58:46.484
Everything.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.142
Seyyed?

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:21.645
I had forgotten just how
fucking boring this place was.

01:00:26.072 --> 01:00:28.609
I used lo collect
small pieces of limestone

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.312
from the prison yard

01:00:31.444 --> 01:00:33.981
and shape them
against the metal bars

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.118
and play chess with them
for hours and hours.

01:00:39.619 --> 01:00:42.293
<i>Whatever it took
to keep strong,</i>

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:44.967
<i>sane.</i>

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.067
I'm thinking
of signing the paper.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:52.672
Why?

01:00:55.001 --> 01:00:58.244
Because I would very much
like to get out of here.

01:00:58.805 --> 01:01:02.184
<i>You know, it's not
just signing a piece of paper.</i>

01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:04.277
<i>They will make
an example of you.</i>

01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:06.119
<i>So</i> what?
<i>You will be on television.</i>

01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:07.453
So what?

01:01:08.148 --> 01:01:09.684
You must leave here,

01:01:09.783 --> 01:01:12.093
<i>but you must leave here</i> a <i>man.</i>

01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:14.432
Maryam would understand.

01:01:14.621 --> 01:01:16.794
Maryam is not here.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.266
I am.

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:37.313
Maryam”.

01:01:41.848 --> 01:01:43.384
<i>Bahari!</i>

01:01:44.818 --> 01:01:45.990
<i>You are here
for Maryam Bahari, right?</i>

01:01:46.052 --> 01:01:47.053
Yes.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.056
You may see her.
One half hour.

01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:50.395
Only the parents can go in.

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.730
Why? Why?

01:01:51.825 --> 01:01:52.895
Don't touch him!

01:01:52.992 --> 01:01:55.404
You're going to kill me, boy?
You going to kill me?

01:01:55.495 --> 01:01:56.838
Stay there!

01:01:57.297 --> 01:02:00.039
<i>This is the boy.
He said he would "get me. "</i>

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.012
I just want
To see my sister.

01:02:03.903 --> 01:02:05.576
<i> Blindfold.</i>

01:02:09.242 --> 01:02:10.482
Mazi...

01:02:10.543 --> 01:02:12.079
Mazi <i>jaan!</i>

01:02:18.251 --> 01:02:19.924
Shame on you!

01:02:20.019 --> 01:02:23.592
You blindfold a 10-year-old?
Shame on you!

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.090
I will kill them

01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:27.765
and they can throw me
in this shithouse.

01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:29.169
I want to kill you!
No!

01:02:29.229 --> 01:02:31.607
No, Mazi!
No! No!

01:02:31.698 --> 01:02:33.177
No, you can't.

01:02:33.233 --> 01:02:34.337
No!

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:39.582
I need you out there.
I need you out there.

01:02:41.574 --> 01:02:44.180
You must see all the
films you can see,

01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:49.524
you must listen to the most
beautiful music you can find.

01:02:49.949 --> 01:02:51.087
Okay?

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.058
I will live that through you.

01:02:55.288 --> 01:02:58.861
Be that for me,
okay? Promise?

01:02:59.692 --> 01:03:00.898
Okay.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.537
It's okay.

01:03:05.432 --> 01:03:06.775
It's okay.

01:03:35.795 --> 01:03:38.298
No, Mazi. No.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.571
<i>I'm concentrating.</i>

01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:42.237
<i>You should see,
I mean, you look really...</i>

01:03:42.302 --> 01:03:43.502
<i>You look really good from here.</i>

01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:47.474
<i>Stop it.
Turn it off.</i>

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.954
<i>Don't move.
Don't... Don't move.</i>

01:03:53.012 --> 01:03:54.286
<i> I'm embarrassed.
Put it away.</i>

01:03:54.347 --> 01:03:55.587
No, it's okay.

01:04:25.144 --> 01:04:27.488
My bosses are
not happy with you.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.889
But I don't understand.

01:04:29.983 --> 01:04:32.122
I'm trying to do
everything you want me...

01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:34.062
I am trying to figure out
the media conspiracy,

01:04:34.153 --> 01:04:35.188
but I cannot lie to you.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.323
I know.
Huh?

01:04:36.389 --> 01:04:37.993
I know this.

01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:39.866
But they have
decided to kill you.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:42.800
I brought you a Nescafé.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.134
Why...

01:04:44.197 --> 01:04:46.302
Why do they want to kill me?

01:04:46.366 --> 01:04:48.346
There is milk and sugar.

01:04:51.538 --> 01:04:53.211
You don't like my Nescafé?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:57.015
I don't understand what they
can achieve by killing me.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.747
You don't like my Nescafé.

01:05:01.915 --> 01:05:03.519
Blindfold.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.431
It's...
Blindfold.

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.774
Now is the time.

01:05:31.277 --> 01:05:32.347
No...

01:05:33.079 --> 01:05:34.581
No, don't!

01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:37.388
No, no! No...

01:06:33.006 --> 01:06:34.076
What a terrible thing

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.518
for a wife to lose her husband.

01:06:36.609 --> 01:06:38.589
A mother, her son.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.753
For a child to grow up
and never know their father,

01:06:42.815 --> 01:06:44.192
that's a terrible thing.

01:06:48.187 --> 01:06:50.030
- What are you doing?
- You should see.

01:06:50.123 --> 01:06:51.163
<i>I mean, you look really...</i>

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.032
<i>You look really good from here.</i>

01:06:53.126 --> 01:06:55.037
<i>No, Mazi. No.</i>

01:06:55.161 --> 01:06:57.107
But the choice is yours.

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:03.006
You will go on television

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.514
and tell how you lied
to our great people,

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:09.143
how you put
anti-revolutionary elements

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:11.620
in touch with
the foreign agents.

01:07:11.678 --> 01:07:12.782
And you will apologize

01:07:12.845 --> 01:07:15.621
to our great Master
for breaking his heart.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.887
You will do all this,

01:07:17.984 --> 01:07:21.056
or your beautiful wife
will be a widow.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.042
I apologize...
I apologize...

01:07:33.533 --> 01:07:36.480
I apologize to all
the Iranian people

01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:38.174
for what they saw.

01:07:38.237 --> 01:07:41.912
I am not a person...

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:45.151
Baba, please, please.
I'm trying to learn this.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:53.428
You never had to do this.

01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:56.557
You never had to
speak on television.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:00.728
You always kept
your integrity intact.

01:08:02.729 --> 01:08:04.538
You never faced this.

01:08:06.566 --> 01:08:09.069
They barely touched you.

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:16.344
<i>Others have suffered more.</i>

01:08:17.577 --> 01:08:20.057
No, Baba. No, no.
You don't understand.

01:08:22.215 --> 01:08:23.853
You were what
they said you were.

01:08:23.916 --> 01:08:25.292
<i>You can
choose who you are.</i>

01:08:25.384 --> 01:08:27.386
I am not a spy.
I am not a spy...

01:08:27.453 --> 01:08:29.865
<i>They locked you
up, but you are still free.</i>

01:08:29.921 --> 01:08:31.401
You don't understand, Baba!

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.426
You were who
they said you were.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:34.630
You filmed the <i>truth</i>

01:08:34.727 --> 01:08:36.764
<i>about these sisterfuckers.</i>

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.106
<i>What is more dangerous to them
than the truth. huh? Tel! me.</i>

01:08:41.934 --> 01:08:45.073
It didn't change anything.
Look where it got me.

01:08:45.138 --> 01:08:47.550
<i>God damn it,
believe in something;.</i>

01:08:47.607 --> 01:08:49.314
<i>It is your only hope.</i>

01:08:49.408 --> 01:08:50.978
Like communism?

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.317
Did it ever occur to you

01:08:56.415 --> 01:08:59.919
that the dream that kept
you during your torment,

01:08:59.986 --> 01:09:01.590
it was corrupt?

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:07.805
Your great Russian heroes,
they also torture.

01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:12.738
Your torture was
conceived in the Gulags.

01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:16.837
Where do you think the Shah's
secret police got it from?

01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:20.674
From the Soviets.

01:09:20.773 --> 01:09:22.309
From the CIA, from the Mossad.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:25.685
From all the fucked up
secret services of the world.

01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:28.617
Was it worth it?

01:09:31.951 --> 01:09:33.487
Was it worth

01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:37.657
leaving a mother
and a child on their own?

01:09:42.795 --> 01:09:44.774
I'm going to learn this.

01:09:46.465 --> 01:09:48.774
I'm going to say it on camera.

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:53.145
And then I'm going to go home.

01:09:55.508 --> 01:09:56.543
What <i>is</i> your <i>name?</i>

01:09:56.642 --> 01:09:59.054
<i>And tell us about your role
in the colored coup d'état.</i>

01:10:01.314 --> 01:10:04.124
<i>My name is Maziar Bahari.</i>

01:10:04.183 --> 01:10:07.960
<i>And I am a member
of the western media.</i>

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.398
<i>I am</i> a <i>journalist, and as such,</i>

01:10:10.523 --> 01:10:13.902
<i>I am a member of the
Western capitalist machine.</i>

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.573
Western media saw its
candidate lose the elections,

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:23.044
on June the 12th of 2009.

01:10:25.738 --> 01:10:28.241
<i>Western media
claimed it was a fraud</i>

01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:30.252
<i>to undermine and to hurt</i>

01:10:30.343 --> 01:10:32.380
<i>the legitimacy
of the elections.</i>

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.359
Western media afterwards
claimed that there was a coup.

01:10:39.218 --> 01:10:42.927
What followed was a series
of preplanned actions

01:10:43.522 --> 01:10:48.267
designed to foment
a failed color revolution.

01:10:51.097 --> 01:10:55.375
My colleagues and I started
to ignore accurate reporting

01:10:55.434 --> 01:10:58.381
and we produced reports
that were very inaccurate

01:10:58.437 --> 01:10:59.882
and illegal.

01:11:00.406 --> 01:11:04.218
<i>I apologize to
the Iranian people.</i>

01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:06.587
<i>...and to my family.</i>

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:10.627
<i>And to our Supreme Leader
for my actions</i>

01:11:10.716 --> 01:11:12.559
<i>and my wrongdoings.</i>

01:11:16.589 --> 01:11:18.262
Seyyed!

01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:21.363
<i>That's it!?</i>

01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:48.065
Davood?
Maziar?

01:11:48.955 --> 01:11:50.093
Hey, are you okay?

01:11:50.156 --> 01:11:51.965
Yeah, I'm fine.
What happened?

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.379
No, no, no,
it's nothing. Come on.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.963
I am sorry. I am very sorry
to put you through this mess.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.769
Hey, if it makes you
feel any better,

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.436
I told them everything I knew
about you and your activities.

01:12:03.636 --> 01:12:05.274
Why didn't you tell me
you were the mastermind

01:12:05.338 --> 01:12:07.443
of the green revolution, hmm?

01:12:07.506 --> 01:12:08.906
I could have doubled
my driver fees.

01:12:08.941 --> 01:12:10.921
I'm very sorry, Davood.

01:12:13.145 --> 01:12:14.818
I'm going to get
you out of here.

01:12:15.147 --> 01:12:16.785
As soon <i>as</i> I come out, I'm
going to do everything I can.

01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:18.658
Don't worry about me.

01:12:19.452 --> 01:12:20.931
I'll be fine.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.549
Specialist time.

01:12:44.977 --> 01:12:46.047
Yes?

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.118
Yes.

01:13:03.829 --> 01:13:05.035
Stay.

01:13:08.567 --> 01:13:09.671
Javadi.

01:13:10.336 --> 01:13:11.406
Yes, sir?

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.984
Four thugs beat up a Basij.

01:13:25.184 --> 01:13:28.757
I want them to feel 10 punches
for every punch they gave.

01:13:30.056 --> 01:13:31.228
But

01:13:32.091 --> 01:13:33.570
Bahari confessed.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.562
Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:36.429 --> 01:13:37.840
The thugs.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:45.874
Yes, sir.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.181
What's wrong?
Blindfold!

01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:52.881
What?
Blindfold!

01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.724
Sir, what's happening?

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.427
I confessed!
You did nothing.

01:14:02.888 --> 01:14:05.391
I confessed!
You did nothing!

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:07.028
Sir, I said exactly what
you wanted me to say.

01:14:07.093 --> 01:14:10.131
You confessed, but
nothing has changed!

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.239
I did what you told me to do!

01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:19.940
I will see to it that you
rot here, dirty spy.

01:14:21.307 --> 01:14:22.911
I'm no spy, sir.

01:14:22.975 --> 01:14:25.819
Your wife will
never see you again.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.388
Oh, sir...
Your child...

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.122
Your child will never know you!

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:34.961
And your mother will
die brokenhearted.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.658
And you did this!

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.140
No...

01:14:51.003 --> 01:14:53.745
Sir, please.
No... Please...

01:14:54.406 --> 01:14:55.350
Please.

01:14:55.441 --> 01:14:56.852
Get down.
Please...

01:14:56.942 --> 01:14:58.444
Get down!

01:14:59.011 --> 01:15:01.787
Get down! Motherfucker!
Please...

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.136
Please stop.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.856
You spread these lies!

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:43.858
Answer the question!

01:15:47.726 --> 01:15:48.864
Answer the questions!

01:17:14.747 --> 01:17:16.249
I'm forgotten.

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:27.899
Maryam...

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:35.744
I'm afraid.

01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:38.941
You?

01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:40.574
You're afraid?

01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:43.950
They are afraid.

01:17:44.109 --> 01:17:48.285
They've tortured you for
the crime of bearing witness.

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:51.193
This is fear.

01:17:53.986 --> 01:17:55.932
They are scared of you.

01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:02.638
They are weak,
Mazi jaan. Not you.

01:18:06.699 --> 01:18:08.337
Use your freedom.

01:18:09.968 --> 01:18:11.675
Use their weakness.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.182
Use their weakness.

01:18:19.978 --> 01:18:21.389
Fight, Mazi.

01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:27.959
You have a lot
of women's phone numbers.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.057
Does your wife know
about your cheating?

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:34.632
Shirin Ebadi. You have
four numbers for her.

01:18:34.693 --> 01:18:36.366
When and where did
you have sex with her?

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:39.068
She is a very respectable
and married woman.

01:18:39.164 --> 01:18:40.199
Yes.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:42.802
I interviewed her
a couple of times.

01:18:43.001 --> 01:18:44.036
If you never fucked her,

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:45.911
why do you have
four numbers for her?

01:18:46.505 --> 01:18:49.577
I also have 10 numbers
for Ahmadinejad.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.388
Why all this traveling?

01:18:55.013 --> 01:18:56.856
All these numbers. Why?

01:18:56.915 --> 01:18:59.589
What is this?
This is porno? Porno?

01:18:59.685 --> 01:19:02.029
How many girlfriends
do you have?

01:19:02.087 --> 01:19:03.930
Why all these numbers? Why?

01:19:04.022 --> 01:19:06.901
How many times do you
have sex with them?

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.027
Why? Why?

01:19:08.093 --> 01:19:09.163
Are they whores?

01:19:09.228 --> 01:19:11.606
Why all this traveling? Why?

01:19:11.697 --> 01:19:14.041
l am
ashamed to say, sir.

01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:17.039
What's that, spy?

01:19:18.036 --> 01:19:19.674
What do you mean?

01:19:23.876 --> 01:19:25.753
No, I shouldn't tell you.

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.118
Please don't...
Don't make me do this.

01:19:27.212 --> 01:19:30.421
You can tell me anything.
That's why you are here.

01:19:31.116 --> 01:19:32.254
Well...

01:19:34.219 --> 01:19:36.199
I travel to all these places...

01:19:36.255 --> 01:19:37.359
Yeah.

01:19:37.923 --> 01:19:40.130
Because I enjoy massage.

01:19:40.225 --> 01:19:42.262
Massage?
What do you mean?

01:19:44.897 --> 01:19:47.104
Massage. Massage...

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.644
Yeah, massage.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:53.413
Of a sexual nature.

01:19:58.644 --> 01:20:01.250
I can't believe
I'm telling you this. I...

01:20:01.313 --> 01:20:02.434
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't...

01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:05.621
No, no, no.
It's good. Go on.

01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:13.100
I travel regularly

01:20:14.626 --> 01:20:15.969
to get these massages

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.439
because I find myself
addicted to them.

01:20:20.999 --> 01:20:23.001
It helps satisfy my need.

01:20:27.105 --> 01:20:28.311
Hmm.

01:20:30.976 --> 01:20:34.947
These massage,
are they expensive?

01:20:37.015 --> 01:20:40.485
No. No, they're actually
quite reasonably priced.

01:20:43.121 --> 01:20:45.692
You walk into an establishment,

01:20:45.791 --> 01:20:47.930
and they are there, lined up.

01:20:47.993 --> 01:20:49.267
All of them.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.606
Very beautiful.
Very... Very young.

01:20:52.664 --> 01:20:54.803
And you choose
the girl that you like,

01:20:56.201 --> 01:20:58.203
and they take you by the hand

01:20:58.303 --> 01:21:00.476
and they lead you to a room

01:21:02.307 --> 01:21:03.786
that has a waterbed.

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:07.882
Then she starts to undress you.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.358
And she undresses
herself as well.

01:21:14.386 --> 01:21:15.906
But I probably
shouldn't tell you this.

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.558
I probably shouldn't

01:21:18.323 --> 01:21:19.666
No, no, no, please continue.

01:21:19.825 --> 01:21:21.168
No, I don't want to continue.

01:21:21.226 --> 01:21:22.534
Please. This could...
No.

01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:25.632
This could be very
important information.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:32.843
So...

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.553
There is one massage
that is called...

01:21:38.544 --> 01:21:40.217
You wouldn't believe this, sir.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.588
It's called
the Persian massage.

01:21:45.417 --> 01:21:48.227
It comes from the time
of Cyrus The Great.

01:21:50.589 --> 01:21:52.660
And what it consists of

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.368
is three girls
at the same time.

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:02.072
The girls are very professional

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.169
and they know exactly
what they are doing.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:09.785
And they immediately
start squeezing you.

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.746
They squeeze you
and they release you,

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:15.415
and they squeeze you
and they release you.

01:22:17.049 --> 01:22:19.393
And it is
the best feeling, sir.

01:22:40.472 --> 01:22:42.884
<i>Four trips to America.</i>

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.322
So why all these trips?

01:22:50.248 --> 01:22:51.818
I was desperate.

01:22:52.618 --> 01:22:53.756
Yes.

01:22:58.256 --> 01:23:00.668
The reason
I went to New Jersey...

01:23:03.829 --> 01:23:05.229
You know what happens
in New Jersey.

01:23:05.263 --> 01:23:06.435
Yeah, of course.
Everybody knows

01:23:06.498 --> 01:23:07.772
what happens in New Jersey.

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.779
Oh. I...

01:23:12.004 --> 01:23:14.780
I... I had to see it
with my own eyes.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.478
What did you see?

01:23:16.975 --> 01:23:19.956
Well, there is this place
that's called Fort Lee.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.089
It's a military town.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:23.590
It used to be, sir.

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:27.157
Now it is a massage playground.

01:23:28.353 --> 01:23:30.264
And it is massages
from all over the world.

01:23:30.322 --> 01:23:31.460
Oh.

01:23:32.624 --> 01:23:34.695
So I went there

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:38.302
because I had heard
crazy stories.

01:23:40.332 --> 01:23:42.369
Crazy stories
about people dying.

01:23:42.467 --> 01:23:43.810
Dying?
Yes.

01:23:44.469 --> 01:23:46.540
What do you mean?

01:23:47.039 --> 01:23:48.484
Of pleasure.

01:23:49.474 --> 01:23:50.885
Of pleasure?

01:23:51.309 --> 01:23:52.811
Unbelievable.

01:23:54.346 --> 01:23:55.825
Not for New Jersey.

01:23:55.881 --> 01:23:57.121
No?
No.

01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:00.155
Newsweek reporter

01:24:00.218 --> 01:24:02.630
<i>Maziar Bahari
has been arrested.</i>

01:24:02.688 --> 01:24:04.133
<i>What is your reaction to that?</i>

01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:08.797
<i>Well, I am just appalled
at the treatment</i>

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.534
<i>that Mr. Bahari
and others are receiving.</i>

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.802
<i>It is a show trial.</i>

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.344
Thai explains this very
silly move you did there.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:18.971
Yeah, which one?

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:20.977
Specialist time,

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.347
Mr. Hillary Clinton.

01:24:32.084 --> 01:24:34.690
What did you say?
Mr. Hillary Clinton.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.663
She's been talking
a lot about you.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.761
Sheytoon.
Naughty boy.

01:24:48.767 --> 01:24:51.771
Hello?
Salaam. They've taken Mazi!

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:53.915
<i>The government.</i>

01:24:54.005 --> 01:24:55.040
We need a lawyer.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.175
<i>There must be
something we can do!</i>

01:24:57.275 --> 01:24:58.948
How long has he been in there?

01:24:59.044 --> 01:25:02.685
How long? Too long!
Even one day is too long.

01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:05.688
I've sent letters
to the Italian

01:25:05.784 --> 01:25:07.286
and the Canadian embassy.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:11.801
<i>And we've also got some
petitions up on the website.</i>

01:25:12.724 --> 01:25:15.068
I'm six and a half
months pregnant.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:18.197
And it's important
to remain positive.

01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:21.540
<i>Maziar Bahari is the
correspondent for Newsweek...</i>

01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:23.353
<i>He's not
been seen by his family</i>

01:25:23.401 --> 01:25:24.762
<i>since his detention
six months ago.</i>

01:25:24.803 --> 01:25:25.975
<i>Maziar Bahari is being
held now according to...</i>

01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:31.145
<i>We're trying
very hard to get</i>

01:25:31.243 --> 01:25:32.722
<i>as much publicity as possible.</i>

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:47.131
<i>We've expressed our concern</i>

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:50.172
<i>about Mr. Bahari's
confinement.</i>

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.238
<i>It is a sign of weakness.</i>

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:02.909
Your wife talks too much.

01:26:07.612 --> 01:26:10.252
She is talking badly
about Iran.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.756
Doing interviews.

01:26:14.452 --> 01:26:16.090
Writing letters.

01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:19.432
Stand up.

01:26:20.792 --> 01:26:21.998
No, sir. No...

01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:23.333
Stand up.

01:26:23.795 --> 01:26:27.038
Please...
Stand up.

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:33.939
Blindfold off.

01:26:44.716 --> 01:26:45.990
Call her.

01:26:47.886 --> 01:26:49.957
My wife?
Call her.

01:26:50.722 --> 01:26:52.224
Yes, sir. Yes.

01:26:53.491 --> 01:26:55.129
Call her

01:26:55.227 --> 01:26:59.198
and tell her
to stop talking shit.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:01.243
And you have to
dial nine to get out.

01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:02.403
Nine?
Nine.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.570
Okay.

01:27:16.681 --> 01:27:18.160
Hello.
Paola?

01:27:19.517 --> 01:27:21.588
Mazi, hi. Hi!

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:24.258
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:27:24.356 --> 01:27:26.700
<i>Mazi, everyone's supporting you.
Everyone.</i>

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.270
We'll get you out, Mazi.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:31.038
<i>The baby?
The baby is fine.</i>

01:27:31.529 --> 01:27:33.338
<i>The baby is great, actually.</i>

01:27:34.099 --> 01:27:36.010
<i>We're having a girl, my love.</i>

01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:37.774
Be a man.

01:27:37.869 --> 01:27:40.281
<i>Be</i> a <i>man.
Marianna Maryam Bahari.</i>

01:27:41.539 --> 01:27:43.041
I love you.

01:27:43.108 --> 01:27:44.246
<i>I love you, Mazi.</i>

01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:53.025
Be a man.
Control this woman!

01:27:53.118 --> 01:27:55.428
She cannot talk badly about us!

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.194
You have to stop her
and control her!

01:27:58.290 --> 01:28:00.896
She cannot talk badly about us!

01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:04.800
She cannot speak
to anybody about you!

01:28:04.896 --> 01:28:06.375
You have to control her!

01:28:06.464 --> 01:28:08.034
Okay.

01:28:09.134 --> 01:28:10.238
<i>Okay.</i>

01:28:15.407 --> 01:28:17.216
Shall I call her again?

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:41.767
What are you doing?

01:28:42.834 --> 01:28:44.074
Stop, please.

01:28:44.836 --> 01:28:46.679
No, stop.
Thank you.

01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:48.011
No.
Thank you.

01:28:48.106 --> 01:28:49.517
Please stop.

01:30:28.606 --> 01:30:30.017
To Marianna!

01:30:30.108 --> 01:30:31.451
Maryam Bahari!

01:30:31.543 --> 01:30:32.578
Marianna!

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.623
Maryam Bahari!

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.484
Did I torture you?
Did I?

01:31:06.377 --> 01:31:09.722
I tell you, my father
was tortured by the SAVAK.

01:31:10.482 --> 01:31:13.725
They beat him up so badly
that he couldn't walk.

01:31:14.652 --> 01:31:17.895
Even now, 30 years later.

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:23.835
I did not do that to you.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.506
If this is not torture
then what is it?

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.106
Many people seek to destroy us.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:36.082
And many people
don't admit that easily.

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.446
I was not seeking this.

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:42.783
Good.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:49.929
A pleasure to see you
again, Mr. Bahari.

01:31:50.021 --> 01:31:52.023
And it's a pleasure, sir.

01:31:52.457 --> 01:31:56.701
I hope your time here
has not been too unpleasant.

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:58.965
Well, the nature
of prison is...

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.098
It's prison, right?

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:01.266
Yes.

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.276
Please.
Yes.

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.711
As you know,
the discipline

01:32:06.804 --> 01:32:09.808
of media espionage
is a new one.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.319
Oh, yes, it is everywhere.
It's a new trend.

01:32:12.644 --> 01:32:16.023
The West has been quite
effective in blurring the line

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:19.152
between a spy and journalists.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:23.732
We must catch up if we are
to battle effectively.

01:32:24.989 --> 01:32:26.662
Do you understand?

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.570
Do you want me to become a spy?

01:32:32.664 --> 01:32:36.908
We want you to help our holy
system with information.

01:32:37.001 --> 01:32:39.845
Now' this is a letter
of commitment...

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.416
Mmm-hmm.
...Mr. Bahari.

01:32:41.506 --> 01:32:44.749
Read it thoroughly,
sign it, stamp it.

01:32:44.842 --> 01:32:46.913
The letter basically is for you

01:32:47.011 --> 01:32:49.924
to provide us with
reports, information,

01:32:50.014 --> 01:32:53.484
any anti-Iran activity.
And the letter...

01:32:57.922 --> 01:33:00.334
Yes. Yes.
Excellent.

01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:02.361
Specialist.

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:09.202
Because of your
diligence and good work

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.904
on behalf of Islamic Republic,

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:13.846
this man is back on the
path of righteousness.

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:15.844
Seyyed!

01:33:21.446 --> 01:33:23.517
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Bahari.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:25.525
Blindfold.

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:39.800
Thank you, sir.

01:33:40.298 --> 01:33:41.641
Thank you.

01:33:42.567 --> 01:33:47.038
So the man they accused
of being a spy

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:50.375
is not a spy.

01:33:52.410 --> 01:33:55.323
But if you would like
to become a spy,

01:33:56.381 --> 01:34:01.387
you know, for us, that
would be appreciated.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.063
Bahari.

01:34:04.155 --> 01:34:05.395
Seyyed.

01:34:21.939 --> 01:34:23.418
Come.

01:35:55.933 --> 01:35:58.243
Good
morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:00.577
<i>On behalf of Captain Dazmond
and the entire crew,</i>

01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:02.617
<i>welcome aboard
ﬂight number 3826.</i>

01:36:02.707 --> 01:36:04.709
<i>Nonstop service
from Tehran to London.</i>

01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:07.846
<i>Our ﬂight time will be
six hours and 15 minutes.</i>

01:36:07.945 --> 01:36:09.891
<i>Si! back, relax,
and enjoy the flight.</i>

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:19.028
Would you
like some coffee, sir?

01:36:19.123 --> 01:36:20.193
And here's your tea.

01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:21.462
Thanks very much.

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:24.601
Coffee or tea?

01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:27.132
<i>Finally, I was free.</i>

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:33.906
<i>But my joy is tempered
by those I left behind.</i>

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:38.782
<i>People that did not
have the advantage</i>

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:41.049
<i>of international attention.</i>

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.551
<i>Countrymen and women,</i>

01:36:46.651 --> 01:36:49.257
<i>whose only crime
against the state</i>

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:51.765
<i>is not believing
in its perfection.</i>

01:37:03.267 --> 01:37:07.079
<i>And the acolytes.
Those without imagination.</i>

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:13.248
<i>"Those who,
even in my confinement,</i>

01:37:13.344 --> 01:37:15.756
<i>were more alone
and afraid than I.</i>

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:24.127
<i>Because in their hearts,
they know they cannot win.</i>
