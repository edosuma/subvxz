WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:10.172
>> START THE CLOCK.

00:15.406 --> 00:22.339
>> RIGHT HERE, WITH ME.

00:30.139 --> 00:35.972
>> Bill: OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:36.506 --> 00:40.606
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.673
PLEASE!

00:45.972 --> 00:48.939
THESE ARE PUMPED UP PEOPLE.

00:49.006 --> 00:52.972
TRY TO REMAIN CALM, THERE IS

00:53.039 --> 00:54.906
NATIONAL EMERGENCY!

00:54.972 --> 01:01.673
HE DID IT, FUCKO DID IT TODAY.

01:01.740 --> 01:02.673
HE DECLARED A NATIONAL

01:02.740 --> 01:05.072
EMERGENCY, HE WAS IN THE ROSE

01:05.139 --> 01:06.206
GARDEN, YOU COULD TELL THIS IS

01:06.273 --> 01:08.039
WHEN HE HAS EXECUTIVE TIME, HE

01:08.106 --> 01:12.939
WAS STILL IN CURLERS.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.106
THIS WAS COMPLETELY CRACKERS,

01:14.172 --> 01:16.740
I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE BUT THIS

01:16.806 --> 01:19.339
WAS ONE LONG BASELESS,

01:19.406 --> 01:20.306
INCOHERENT STREAM OF

01:20.373 --> 01:22.139
CONSCIOUSNESS, CALL THE NURSING

01:22.206 --> 01:25.840
HOME RANT.

01:25.906 --> 01:26.573
WE DON'T EVEN NOTICE ANYMORE

01:26.640 --> 01:29.773
WHEN HE GETS STUPIDER.

01:29.840 --> 01:41.573
IT'S LIKE FARTING ON A GARBAGE

01:41.640 --> 01:44.139
SHIP.

01:44.206 --> 01:45.939
YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD HAVE

01:46.006 --> 01:46.806
DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

01:46.873 --> 01:49.840
LONG AGO?

01:49.906 --> 01:50.939
FACT-CHECKERS.

01:51.006 --> 01:53.406
THERE IS NO REALITY ANYMORE,

01:53.473 --> 01:54.840
REPORTERS WERE ASKING HIM

01:54.906 --> 01:55.506
QUESTIONS.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.172
AT ONE POINT HE SAID TO A

01:57.239 --> 01:58.840
REPORTER WHO GAVE HIM STATISTICS

01:58.906 --> 02:01.072
FROM HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION, HE

02:01.139 --> 02:05.939
SAID "YOU REALLY BELIEVE STATS?"

02:06.006 --> 02:07.539
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY LEFT TO

02:07.606 --> 02:08.840
SAY ABOUT THIS EXCEPT A NATIONAL

02:08.906 --> 02:12.806
EMERGENCY SHOULD NOT BE USED BY

02:12.873 --> 02:16.640
TRUMP, IT SHOULD BE USED ON

02:16.706 --> 02:17.406
TRUMP.

02:21.406 --> 02:23.972
TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY, WE HAD A

02:24.039 --> 02:25.373
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, REMEMBER

02:25.439 --> 02:26.172
THAT?

02:26.239 --> 02:28.740
OVER THE WALL AND NOW WE ARE

02:28.806 --> 02:29.573
HAVING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

02:29.640 --> 02:32.172
DECLARED OVER A WALL, BECAUSE

02:32.239 --> 02:34.806
THE MASTER NEGOTIATOR WAS

02:34.873 --> 02:35.373
OFFERED $25 BILLION FOR HIS

02:35.439 --> 02:36.840
WALLET SOME TIME AGO.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.373
HE TURNED THAT DOWN.

02:39.439 --> 02:41.006
IN DECEMBER HE WAS OFFERED

02:41.072 --> 02:43.773
1.6 BILLION, TURNED THAT DOWN.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.139
NOW THEY SIGNED A DEAL FOR

02:46.206 --> 02:46.439
1.3 BILLION.

02:46.506 --> 02:49.806
TO DATE, MEXICO SAID IF IT GETS

02:49.873 --> 02:51.939
IN A LOWER, MAYBE WE WILL PAY

02:52.006 --> 02:53.840
FOR IT.

02:59.006 --> 02:59.539
TRUMP PROMISED HIS SUPPORTERS

02:59.606 --> 03:02.773
OVER A THOUSAND MILES OF BIG,

03:02.840 --> 03:04.139
BEAUTIFUL WALL, HE GOT 55 MILES

03:04.206 --> 03:06.972
OF A FENCE.

03:07.039 --> 03:09.773
DID YOU SEE THIS?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.373
THEY CHANGED THE SLOGAN FROM

03:11.439 --> 03:14.873
"BUILD THE WALL" TO "FINISH THE

03:14.939 --> 03:15.606
WALL."

03:15.673 --> 03:17.873
HE TOLD THEM, I ALREADY BUILT A

03:17.939 --> 03:20.573
LOT OF WALL, HE'S BUILT NO WALL!

03:20.640 --> 03:22.239
HE TELLS THEM THAT AND THEY

03:22.306 --> 03:24.072
CHANGE THE SLOGAN.

03:24.139 --> 03:26.039
MONDAY IS PRESIDENTS' DAY, WE'VE

03:26.106 --> 03:29.439
GONE FROM "I CANNOT TELL A LIE"

03:29.506 --> 03:30.673
TO "I CANNOT TELL WHEN I'M

03:30.740 --> 03:34.206
LYING."

03:34.273 --> 03:35.506
JUST TELLING THE PEOPLE YOU'VE

03:35.573 --> 03:36.773
DONE IT, I KNOW WE ARE NOT

03:36.840 --> 03:41.473
SUPPOSED TO SAY THEY ARE STUPID.

03:41.539 --> 03:41.740
LAUGHTER

03:45.072 --> 03:46.106
ANN COULTER IS SAYING THAT ABOUT

03:46.172 --> 03:48.339
THEM, ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE

03:48.406 --> 03:50.206
WE CAN CHANGE REALITY BY

03:50.273 --> 03:51.606
CHANGING THE CHANCE?

03:51.673 --> 03:53.172
IT'S LIKE A QUEEN SAYING "WE DID

03:53.239 --> 03:56.673
ROCK YOU."

03:56.740 --> 04:04.339
WE HAVE ALREADY ROCKED YOU.

04:04.939 --> 04:07.239
IT'S MADNESS.

04:07.273 --> 04:07.773
THINGS HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN

04:07.873 --> 04:09.306
STARTED AND HE'S ALREADY MOVED

04:09.373 --> 04:12.840
ON TO FINISHING.

04:12.906 --> 04:13.806
AND MELANIA SAID "WELCOME TO MY

04:13.873 --> 04:18.773
WORLD."

04:21.306 --> 04:24.239
WE LAUGH, DON'T WE, BUT THIS IS

04:24.306 --> 04:24.840
FUNDAMENTAL.

04:24.906 --> 04:26.273
REALLY SERIOUS, AND DEMOCRACY

04:26.339 --> 04:28.273
HANGING BY A THREAD THE KIND OF

04:28.339 --> 04:28.873
STUFF.

04:28.939 --> 04:31.840
IT IS, IT'S MORE OF THAT SLOW

04:31.906 --> 04:33.606
MOVING TO THAT I KEEP TALKING

04:33.673 --> 04:33.806
ABOUT.

04:33.873 --> 04:39.106
THE RULES IN 1787 SAYS CONGRESS

04:39.172 --> 04:41.840
IS THE ONE WHO DECIDES HOW WE

04:41.906 --> 04:43.039
SPEND THE MONEY.

04:43.106 --> 04:45.406
TRUMP FOUND A LINE SOMEWHERE IN

04:45.473 --> 04:47.539
AMERICAN LAWS THAT SAYS YES,

04:47.606 --> 04:49.606
INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT DECLARING

04:49.673 --> 04:50.939
A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.

04:51.006 --> 04:52.106
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED ALL

04:52.172 --> 04:54.473
THE CRISES BEFORE IT IS THEY HAD

04:54.539 --> 04:55.773
SOME RESPECT OF WHAT OUR COUNTRY

04:55.840 --> 04:58.706
IS BUILT ON.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.873
ONE WEAPON THAT DOES NOT WORK ON

05:04.939 --> 05:06.072
THIS PRESIDENT IS SAYING GOOD

05:06.139 --> 05:07.039
PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

05:07.106 --> 05:12.673
IT'S LIKE USING SARCASM ON SIRI.

05:16.139 --> 05:17.706
TURNING AMERICA INTO A MONARCHY,

05:17.773 --> 05:18.406
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO

05:18.473 --> 05:20.373
BY YOURSELF.

05:20.439 --> 05:24.439
MITCH McCONNELL -- MITCH

05:24.506 --> 05:25.740
McCONNELL SAID FIRST HE WAS

05:25.806 --> 05:26.139
AGAINST IT.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.473
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:27.539 --> 05:29.673
IF YOU WANT TO GO COMPLETELY

05:29.740 --> 05:31.673
AROUND CONGRESS, YOU HAVE MY

05:31.740 --> 05:31.972
SUPPORT.

05:32.039 --> 05:38.039
AND I THOUGHT HANNITY WAS A

05:38.139 --> 05:40.939
SUBMISSIVE BITCH.

05:41.006 --> 05:43.006
I SAY WE GET AN IMMIGRANT IN

05:43.072 --> 05:45.106
THERE TO DO MITCH McCONNELL'S

05:45.172 --> 05:45.906
JOB, BECAUSE APPARENTLY

05:45.972 --> 05:48.306
UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION IS A

05:48.373 --> 05:50.606
JOB AMERICANS JUST DON'T WANT TO

05:50.673 --> 05:54.106
DO.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.473
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW, PAUL

05:57.539 --> 05:58.373
BEGALA, MAYA WILEY AND DAVID

05:58.439 --> 05:59.473
FRUM ARE HERE AND A LITTLE LATER

05:59.539 --> 06:00.339
WE'LL BE SPEAKING WITH OUR

06:00.406 --> 06:01.573
FRIEND: JOHN LEGEND.

06:01.640 --> 06:02.972
BUT FIRST, HE'S THE TWO-TERM

06:03.039 --> 06:03.840
MAYOR OF CHICAGO AND FORMER

06:03.906 --> 06:05.640
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF TO

06:05.706 --> 06:07.406
PRESIDENT OBAMA: MAYOR RAHM

06:07.473 --> 06:13.506
EMANUEL.

06:16.473 --> 06:20.972
HELLO, YOU HAVE DONE IT ALL.

06:21.039 --> 06:25.373
WELCOME MR. MAYOR, I GUESS I

06:25.439 --> 06:27.906
WON'T BE ABLE TO CALL YOU THAT

06:27.972 --> 06:28.539
FOR MUCH LONGER, WHEN DOES YOUR

06:28.606 --> 06:31.239
TERM AND?

06:31.306 --> 06:32.172
>> MAY 20TH.

06:32.239 --> 06:32.439
>> Bill:

06:32.506 --> 06:37.506
YOU'RE COUNTING THE

06:37.573 --> 06:37.706
DAYS.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.106
YOU DESERVE A BREAK, CLINTON

06:40.172 --> 06:42.206
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF FOR

06:42.273 --> 06:43.939
OBAMA, THAT'S A KILLER JOB.

06:44.006 --> 06:44.706
AHMED SESAY YOU THINK?

06:44.773 --> 06:46.373
>> Bill: YOU MUST BE TIRED AND

06:46.439 --> 06:48.139
YOU EARNED A BREAK.

06:53.206 --> 06:56.006
>> ONE SERIOUS THING, AS THE SUN

06:56.072 --> 06:58.939
AND A GRANDSON OF AN IMMIGRANT,

06:59.006 --> 07:00.339
SERVED TWO PRESIDENTS, MAYOR OF

07:00.406 --> 07:02.506
THE CITY THAT WELCOMED MY

07:02.573 --> 07:03.172
GRANDFATHER, GREATEST COUNTRY IN

07:03.239 --> 07:05.740
THE WORLD, CAN'T BE ANYWHERE

07:05.806 --> 07:07.172
ELSE IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN

07:07.239 --> 07:08.406
BE THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT AND

07:08.473 --> 07:14.373
BECOME THE MAYOR OF THE CITY.

07:14.439 --> 07:16.972
>> Bill: WHO IS HERE TO ARGUE

07:17.039 --> 07:17.339
WITH THAT?

07:17.406 --> 07:20.773
>> WE CAN FIND SOMEBODY.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.972
>> Bill: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON

07:23.039 --> 07:23.473
THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

07:23.539 --> 07:26.640
WHAT WOULD BE THE STRATEGY, YOU

07:26.706 --> 07:28.072
WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH A

07:28.139 --> 07:30.773
STRATEGY TO COMBAT THIS?

07:30.840 --> 07:34.640
>> OUR PRESIDENT WOULD DO THIS.

07:34.706 --> 07:37.239
HERE'S THE FIRST AND FOREMOST,

07:37.306 --> 07:47.740
YOU HAVE A FAUX CONSTITUTIONAL

07:47.806 --> 07:50.573
CRISIS TO COVER UP A CAMPAIGN

07:50.640 --> 07:51.972
CRISIS.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.306
THE CORRECT APPROACH, YOU WANT

07:53.339 --> 07:56.906
TO STOP DRUGS, YOU WANT TO STOP

07:56.972 --> 07:57.172
NARCOTICS?

07:57.239 --> 07:59.439
>> Bill: NO.

07:59.506 --> 08:01.773
>> DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

08:01.840 --> 08:03.106
ON OPIATES, OPIATES ARE KILLING

08:03.172 --> 08:04.106
PEOPLE HERE.

08:04.172 --> 08:09.306
THE OTHER THING IS, THERE'S A

08:09.373 --> 08:11.239
WHOLE STRATEGY AND AN OPENING

08:11.306 --> 08:12.206
HERE.

08:12.273 --> 08:14.139
WHEN YOU HAVE A PINCER AND YOU

08:14.206 --> 08:15.373
HAVE TO CREATE A PINCER CAMPAIGN

08:15.439 --> 08:16.306
AGAINST TRUMP AND THE BASE OF

08:16.373 --> 08:17.606
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE

08:17.673 --> 08:19.640
THEY AREN'T FOR THIS.

08:19.706 --> 08:22.339
>> Bill: HIS BASE IS NOT FOR

08:22.406 --> 08:23.306
THIS?

08:23.373 --> 08:28.373
AND COULTER.

08:28.439 --> 08:30.539
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE

08:30.606 --> 08:31.840
IF YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT, THEY

08:31.906 --> 08:33.072
KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO ONE

08:33.139 --> 08:34.172
DAY GET BACK THERE.

08:34.239 --> 08:38.640
IF YOU START TO LOWER THE BAR,

08:38.706 --> 08:39.706
YOU'RE GIVING AUTHORITY TO THE

08:39.773 --> 08:40.640
CHIEF OF STAFF.

08:40.706 --> 08:41.439
RIGHT NOW THE ONLY THING HOLDING

08:41.506 --> 08:43.239
UP THE PRESIDENT IS THE FACT

08:43.306 --> 08:45.840
THAT HE HAS COWED THE ENTIRE

08:45.906 --> 08:46.139
REPUBLICANS.

08:46.206 --> 08:46.773
START DRIVING THAT WEDGE THERE

08:46.840 --> 08:50.039
TO WEAKEN HIM.

08:50.106 --> 08:51.906
>> Bill: THE DEMOCRATS NEED A

08:51.972 --> 08:55.239
WEDGE DRIVER LIKE YOU.

08:55.306 --> 08:56.172
>> SOME OTHER ADJECTIVES HAVE

08:56.239 --> 08:56.573
BEEN USED.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.972
>> Bill: YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY, I

08:58.039 --> 09:00.840
LIKE THAT.

09:00.906 --> 09:02.939
>> THE BIGGEST THING YOU WANT IS

09:03.006 --> 09:04.673
TO DIVIDE THE BASE OF THE

09:04.740 --> 09:06.039
PRESIDENT GOING INTO 2020.

09:06.106 --> 09:08.506
>> Bill: I'M A BIG FAN OF

09:08.573 --> 09:09.473
NANCY PELOSI, I'M SO GLAD

09:09.539 --> 09:11.239
EVERYONE WAS WHISPERING IN MY

09:11.306 --> 09:12.239
EAR WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP, AND

09:12.306 --> 09:15.039
I SAID NO.

09:15.106 --> 09:16.873
>> AND SHE PROVED IT, THIS IS

09:16.939 --> 09:19.339
WHY YOU DON'T NEED A ROOKIE

09:19.406 --> 09:20.606
SITTING ACROSS FROM

09:20.673 --> 09:20.939
DONALD TRUMP.

09:21.006 --> 09:21.273
DONALD TRUMP.

09:21.339 --> 09:22.006
>> Bill: SPEAKER SETH MOULTON

09:22.072 --> 09:25.406
WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AS WELL.

09:25.473 --> 09:27.840
SHE SAID TODAY, I THINK IT WAS

09:27.906 --> 09:30.239
TODAY, THESE DAYS GO BY SO

09:30.306 --> 09:30.473
QUICKLY.

09:30.539 --> 09:32.673
>> SOMETIMES YOU WANT THAT.

09:33.006 --> 09:33.840
>> Bill: SHE FLOATED THE IDEA

09:33.906 --> 09:35.473
OUT THERE IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT

09:35.539 --> 09:37.373
A PRESIDENT MAYBE WE WOULD

09:37.439 --> 09:38.273
DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON

09:38.339 --> 09:38.473
GUNS.

09:38.539 --> 09:40.473
I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOOD

09:40.539 --> 09:41.840
POLITICS FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.

09:41.906 --> 09:43.740
A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST VOTE ON

09:43.806 --> 09:44.873
GUNS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

09:44.939 --> 09:46.473
DEMOCRATS ARE LICKING THEIR

09:46.539 --> 09:47.039
CHOPS TO DECLARE A NATIONAL

09:47.106 --> 09:51.640
EMERGENCY ON GUNS.

09:51.706 --> 09:53.506
>> I WAS SHOWING RESTRAINT IT

09:53.573 --> 09:54.939
WAS A RARE THING FOR ME.

09:55.006 --> 09:57.640
>> Bill: IT MAY BE A CRISIS,

09:57.706 --> 09:58.840
BUT IT'S NOT A NATIONAL

09:58.906 --> 09:59.106
EMERGENCY.

09:59.172 --> 10:01.539
WE CAN'T BE AS BAD AS THEM,

10:01.606 --> 10:03.873
RIGHT?

10:03.939 --> 10:06.740
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO MIMIC THEIR

10:06.806 --> 10:07.506
POLITICS.

10:07.539 --> 10:09.206
THERE ARE TIMES YOU WANT TO SHOW

10:09.273 --> 10:11.906
STRENGTH BUT ON THIS CASE, WE

10:11.972 --> 10:12.906
ARE GOING TO DECLARE THIS

10:12.972 --> 10:16.072
EMERGENCY, THAT EMERGENCY, THEY

10:16.139 --> 10:16.773
WILL SEE THROUGH IT.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.473
I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE

10:18.539 --> 10:19.506
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY WILL SEE

10:19.573 --> 10:21.840
THIS FOR WHAT IT IS AND REJECT

10:21.906 --> 10:22.906
IT.

10:22.972 --> 10:24.673
THE IDEA IS NOT TO LOWER.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.673
HE WANTS YOU IN CERTAIN CASES TO

10:26.740 --> 10:27.573
MIMIC WHAT HE'S DOING BECAUSE

10:27.640 --> 10:29.706
THEN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

10:29.773 --> 10:31.673
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

10:31.740 --> 10:34.273
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU BREAK THIS

10:34.339 --> 10:35.906
CYCLE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES

10:35.972 --> 10:36.873
THAT WE'VE BEEN IN FOR SUCH A

10:36.939 --> 10:40.506
LONG TIME?

10:40.573 --> 10:42.740
THEY GO BACK TO ROBERT BORK AND

10:42.806 --> 10:47.673
CLINTON WAS IMPEACHED, AND THEY

10:47.740 --> 10:48.906
THINK BUSH WAS HANDLED UNFAIRLY

10:48.972 --> 10:50.673
AND OBAMA OF COURSE WAS HANDLED

10:50.740 --> 10:53.039
UNFAIRLY AND YOU GET TO A POINT

10:53.072 --> 10:53.906
WHERE MITCH McCONNELL SAYS WE

10:53.972 --> 10:54.939
AREN'T EVEN GOING TO CONSIDER

10:55.006 --> 10:55.840
EVERYTHING, WE ARE GOING TO

10:55.906 --> 10:56.306
BLOCK EVERYTHING IN

10:56.373 --> 11:01.106
IF WE DO GT

11:01.172 --> 11:02.740
RID OF TRUMP, THEY ARE JUST

11:02.806 --> 11:04.972
GOING TO WANT REVENGE.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.539
YOU'RE A MAYOR, YOU BREAK CYCLES

11:06.606 --> 11:09.740
AND THINGS, HOW DO YOU BREAK

11:09.806 --> 11:10.039
THIS CYCLE?

11:10.106 --> 11:12.573
>> THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT

11:12.640 --> 11:17.006
I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS

11:17.072 --> 11:17.773
REIGNITED A CIVIC PRIDE AND

11:17.840 --> 11:19.939
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN THE COUNTRY

11:20.006 --> 11:21.339
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

11:21.406 --> 11:23.706
HIS LEGACY IS PEOPLE ARE GETTING

11:23.773 --> 11:25.339
INVOLVED IN A LEVEL WE COULD NOT

11:25.406 --> 11:25.906
DO BEFORE.

11:25.972 --> 11:26.972
THE SECOND THING AND THIS IS

11:27.039 --> 11:28.539
WHAT I WOULD CALL FOR THE

11:28.606 --> 11:30.773
COUNTRY, I'M NOT RUNNING A DON'T

11:30.840 --> 11:32.439
WANT TO RUN, WE NEED NATIONAL

11:32.506 --> 11:35.539
SERVICE AGAIN TO REIGNITE THE

11:35.606 --> 11:37.573
THREADS THAT UNITE US AS

11:37.640 --> 11:38.239
CITIZENS AND PEOPLE COMMITTING

11:38.306 --> 11:40.339
TO SERVE TO THE COUNTRY.

11:40.406 --> 11:41.840
I THINK THE WAY YOU DON'T DO

11:41.906 --> 11:44.573
THIS AS RETRIBUTION, I THINK THE

11:44.640 --> 11:45.972
AMERICAN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE

11:46.039 --> 11:47.206
YOUNG WANT TO BE LIFTED UP TO

11:47.273 --> 11:48.339
HIGHER IDEALS AND I THINK IT'S A

11:48.406 --> 11:50.972
PLACE TO GO FOR THE PARTY.

11:51.039 --> 11:52.939
I THINK ONE OF OUR NOMINEES WILL

11:53.006 --> 11:54.773
ACTUALLY TOUCH THAT FLAME AND

11:54.840 --> 11:55.972
IGNITED IN THE WAY THAT KENNEDY

11:56.039 --> 11:56.139
DID.

11:56.206 --> 11:57.773
>> Bill: WHO DO YOU THINK THAT

11:57.840 --> 11:58.439
NOMINEE WILL BE?

11:58.506 --> 12:00.939
>> THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS WILL

12:01.006 --> 12:01.740
PICK.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.139
WHAT I KNOW ABOUT CAMPAIGNS

12:03.206 --> 12:04.406
HAVING GONE 6 FOR 6, THEY REVEAL

12:04.473 --> 12:06.806
CHARACTER -- HAD TO GET THAT

12:06.873 --> 12:12.740
IN -- THEY REVEAL CHARACTER.

12:13.806 --> 12:15.606
PEOPLE WILL LIFT THE HOOD, KICK

12:15.673 --> 12:17.740
THE TIRES, PEOPLE FORGET

12:17.806 --> 12:18.740
BARACK OBAMA AND

12:18.806 --> 12:19.373
PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL NOT SEEN

12:19.439 --> 12:22.373
AS FRONT RUNNERS.

12:22.439 --> 12:24.206
THEY EMERGE AS A FRONT RUNNER,

12:24.273 --> 12:24.906
THEY CAN SHOW THEY CAN TAKE A

12:24.972 --> 12:27.573
PUNCH AND DELIVER A PUNCH.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.706
THEY CAN RAISE THE COUNTRY AND

12:29.773 --> 12:32.239
GO MANO A MANO AGAINST TRUMP.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.439
YOU CAN'T SEE IT ON PAPER, YOU

12:38.506 --> 12:41.072
CAN'T SEE IT ON PAPER, IT WILL

12:41.139 --> 12:41.939
HAPPEN.

12:42.006 --> 12:43.172
AND THAT PERSON WILL EMERGE.

12:43.239 --> 12:44.706
>> Bill: IN THE DEBATES?

12:44.773 --> 12:47.373
>> THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN.

12:47.439 --> 12:48.306
DO THINGS AND YOU'LL START TO

12:48.373 --> 12:49.806
SEE RONALD REAGAN AND HIS

12:49.873 --> 12:51.939
MOMENT, I PAID FOR THIS

12:52.006 --> 12:52.806
MICROPHONE.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.006
IT BECAME A MOMENT THAT CAPTURED

12:54.072 --> 12:55.239
HIS CHARACTER, THERE WILL BE

12:55.306 --> 12:57.106
THAT MOMENT.

12:57.172 --> 12:58.072
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

12:58.139 --> 13:03.840
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA SHOULD DO?

13:03.906 --> 13:10.206
>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK --

13:10.673 --> 13:12.840
>> Bill: YOU SEEM NERVOUS.

13:13.673 --> 13:15.972
>> I DON'T BUY THAT'S NOT HIS

13:16.039 --> 13:16.206
PHOTO.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.273
I THINK THAT IS HIS PHOTO AND

13:18.339 --> 13:18.806
IT'S WRONG.

13:18.873 --> 13:21.606
>> Bill: WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.

13:21.673 --> 13:23.806
>> WHAT I THINK IS THAT WHAT I

13:23.873 --> 13:25.840
DO KNOW IN READING A LOT OF

13:25.906 --> 13:27.806
HISTORY, YOU TAKE BARACK OBAMA,

13:27.873 --> 13:29.673
HE WASN'T FOR GAY MARRIAGE AT

13:29.740 --> 13:29.873
FIRST.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.573
HE INTEGRATED THE ARMED FORCES

13:31.640 --> 13:33.039
SO GAYS AND LESBIANS COULD SERVE

13:33.106 --> 13:42.673
THE ARMED COUNTRY THEY LOVED.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.473
PRESIDENT LINCOLN WANTED TO

13:44.539 --> 13:46.806
FIGHT THE WAR FOR THE UNION

13:46.873 --> 13:47.406
INSTEAD OF SLAVERY, HE BECAME

13:47.473 --> 13:52.172
THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR.

13:52.239 --> 13:54.172
I THINK HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE

13:54.239 --> 13:55.039
GREATEST FIGHTER FOR CIVIL

13:55.106 --> 13:55.773
RIGHTS BECAUSE HE HAD SOMETHING

13:55.840 --> 13:58.273
TO PROVE.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.239
>> Bill: HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD

14:01.306 --> 14:02.873
ONE.

14:02.939 --> 14:03.806
58% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN

14:03.873 --> 14:06.273
VIRGINIA WANT HIM TO STAY ON THE

14:06.339 --> 14:06.473
JOB.

14:06.539 --> 14:07.873
>> BECAUSE THEY ALSO GOT

14:07.939 --> 14:10.039
HEALTH CARE, HE GOT MEDICAID

14:10.106 --> 14:11.840
THROUGH.

14:11.906 --> 14:13.439
ON ALL THESE THINGS, THE NOTION

14:13.506 --> 14:14.640
THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY,

14:14.706 --> 14:16.706
THE ANSWER IS YOU'RE FIRED.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.072
THE FACT IS HE HAS EVOLVED AND

14:20.139 --> 14:23.239
IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY, THERE'S

14:23.306 --> 14:24.039
NOTHING LIKE A CONVERT.

14:24.106 --> 14:26.373
HE IS GOING TO HAVE A ZEALOTRY

14:26.439 --> 14:27.706
TO PROVE SOMETHING BECAUSE HE

14:27.773 --> 14:28.939
HAS THE CAMPAIGN OF HIS

14:29.006 --> 14:29.239
REPUTATION.

14:29.306 --> 14:35.072
TO MY VIEW, IN VIRGINIA YOU

14:35.139 --> 14:37.172
ESCAPE HISTORY, YOU LEARN FROM

14:37.239 --> 14:38.239
HISTORY.

14:38.306 --> 14:38.873
IT TEACHES YOU WHAT TO DO RIGHT

14:38.972 --> 14:40.072
IN THE FUTURE.

14:46.539 --> 14:48.640
>> Bill: I SAW TODAY IN THE

14:48.706 --> 14:49.873
CITY OF CHICAGO YOU SENT A

14:49.939 --> 14:51.673
LETTER TO JEFF BEZOS OVER AT

14:51.740 --> 14:52.306
AMAZON, NOTHING SALACIOUS ABOUT

14:52.373 --> 14:56.072
YOUR EMAIL.

14:56.139 --> 14:58.139
AND YOU WERE TRYING TO LURE

14:58.206 --> 14:59.840
AMAZON TO CHICAGO BECAUSE THEY

14:59.906 --> 15:00.906
PULLED OUT OF NEW YORK, WHAT DO

15:00.972 --> 15:02.273
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

15:02.339 --> 15:04.072
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT NEW YORK

15:04.139 --> 15:04.840
LOSING THAT AND WHERE YOU THINK

15:04.906 --> 15:08.873
AMAZON SHOULD GO?

15:08.939 --> 15:11.506
>> FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS,

15:11.573 --> 15:14.006
CHICAGO IS THE NUMBER ONE CITY

15:14.072 --> 15:15.939
IN AMERICA FOR CORPORATE

15:16.006 --> 15:16.239
RELOCATIONS?

15:16.306 --> 15:20.539
>> Bill: WHY ARE WE DRIVING

15:20.606 --> 15:22.439
CORPORATIONS?

15:22.506 --> 15:23.972
>> TAKE A LOOK AT NEW YORK, YOU

15:24.039 --> 15:25.706
LOOK AT IT THEY SHOULD HAVE SAID

15:25.773 --> 15:27.706
LOOK, FIX THE SUBWAY NEAR WHERE

15:27.773 --> 15:29.273
WE ARE GOING TO GO AND EVERYBODY

15:29.339 --> 15:31.939
WILL GAIN, THEY WOULD'VE DONE A

15:32.006 --> 15:34.706
TICKER TAPE.

15:34.773 --> 15:35.972
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE CONDITION OF

15:36.039 --> 15:36.939
THE SUBWAY SYSTEM IN NEW YORK,

15:37.006 --> 15:38.239
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS

15:38.306 --> 15:41.106
COMING IN AS A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

15:41.172 --> 15:42.773
IN MY VIEW IS THERE'S A LOT OF

15:42.840 --> 15:44.306
ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT YOU CAN

15:44.373 --> 15:45.506
CREATE THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE

15:45.573 --> 15:48.439
WINNERS AND IT'S A WIN-WIN

15:48.506 --> 15:49.706
SITUATION RATHER THAN ENTICING

15:49.773 --> 15:50.840
OR FINANCIAL, I THINK CHICAGO

15:50.906 --> 15:52.506
HAS A LOT TO OFFER AND THE

15:52.573 --> 15:54.506
NUMBER ONE THING IT HAS TO

15:54.573 --> 15:55.873
OFFER, THE BEST EDUCATED

15:55.939 --> 15:57.773
WORKFORCE IN THE UNITED STATES

15:57.840 --> 15:58.306
OF AMERICA.

15:58.373 --> 16:00.439
>> Bill: SPOKEN LIKE THE MAYOR

16:00.506 --> 16:02.773
OF CHICAGO, YOU'VE EARNED YOUR

16:02.840 --> 16:05.306
VACATION.

16:05.373 --> 16:06.339
RAHM EMANUEL, EVERYBODY, LET'S

16:06.406 --> 16:10.740
MEET OUR PANEL.

16:10.806 --> 16:11.640
HE'S A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND

16:11.706 --> 16:18.439
CNN CONTRIBUTOR: PAUL BEGALA.

16:18.972 --> 16:19.239
OLD FRIENDS.

16:19.306 --> 16:20.006
HE'S A COLUMNIST AT THE ATLANTIC

16:20.072 --> 16:21.406
AND AUTHOR OF "TRUMPOCRACY: THE

16:21.473 --> 16:22.873
CORRUPTION OF THE AMERICAN

16:22.939 --> 16:26.206
REPUBLIC": DAVID FRUM.

16:26.273 --> 16:28.506
PERFECT FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY

16:28.573 --> 16:28.706
TODAY.

16:28.773 --> 16:34.106
SHE'S THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT

16:34.172 --> 16:35.506
AND PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC & URBAN

16:35.573 --> 16:37.339
POLICY AT THE NEW SCHOOL AND

16:37.406 --> 16:45.139
MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: MAYA WILEY.

16:45.206 --> 16:47.539
NO OVERTIME TONIGHT, I'VE GOT TO

16:47.606 --> 16:48.939
GET TO VEGAS.

16:49.006 --> 16:49.473
IF NATIONAL EMERGENCY, WE

16:49.539 --> 16:52.740
THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAPPEN, IT DID.

16:52.806 --> 16:54.306
I THOUGHT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

16:54.373 --> 16:56.006
WAS SOMETHING WE DECLARED ONE

16:56.072 --> 16:57.939
MARTIANS WERE LANDING, NOT

16:58.006 --> 16:59.773
MEXICANS.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.972
IN MY LIFETIME, I'VE SEEN

17:02.039 --> 17:02.740
CONGRESS GIVE UP THE POWER OF

17:02.806 --> 17:05.072
DECLARING WAR, THAT HAPPENED A

17:05.139 --> 17:08.172
LONG TIME BEFORE TRUMP.

17:08.239 --> 17:09.972
TODAY IT SEEMED LIKE THEY LOST

17:10.039 --> 17:11.806
THE POWER, THEIR OTHER BIG POWER

17:11.873 --> 17:14.339
IS HOW YOU SPEND MONEY.

17:14.406 --> 17:16.006
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING WAR AND

17:16.072 --> 17:17.573
YOU'RE NOT DOING MONEY, WHAT ARE

17:17.640 --> 17:18.172
THEY THERE FOR?

17:18.239 --> 17:20.573
>> THEY HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING

17:20.640 --> 17:22.172
YET, IT'S REALLY THE BEGINNING

17:22.239 --> 17:24.206
OF A FIGHT ABOUT WHAT OUR

17:24.273 --> 17:25.273
CONSTITUTION SAYS AND WHETHER

17:25.339 --> 17:28.172
DONALD TRUMP CAN PUBLICLY SAY

17:28.239 --> 17:29.773
THAT "I DID THIS BECAUSE I

17:29.840 --> 17:30.539
WANTED THE WALL EVEN THOUGH

17:30.606 --> 17:36.439
THOSE NO EMERGENCY" AND THEN

17:36.506 --> 17:37.239
CLAIM AN EMERGENCY RATHER THAN

17:37.306 --> 17:38.640
TRY TO BUILD A WALL WE DON'T

17:38.706 --> 17:40.373
NEED TO BECAUSE WE ARE READY

17:40.439 --> 17:42.006
HAVE 700 MILES OF FENCING AND

17:42.072 --> 17:42.906
YOU POINTED OUT DRUGS ACTUALLY

17:42.972 --> 17:45.773
COME THROUGH PORTS.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.806
THIS IS GOING TO GET LITIGATED,

17:48.873 --> 17:49.939
THERE IS A POLITICAL PROCESS

17:50.006 --> 17:51.406
HERE IN THE FORM OF A JOINT

17:51.473 --> 17:54.273
RESOLUTION BUT THE QUESTION OF

17:54.339 --> 17:55.006
WHETHER 60 REPUBLICANS WILL

17:55.072 --> 17:57.573
SUPPORT THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER

17:57.640 --> 17:58.072
ISSUE.

17:58.139 --> 17:59.239
THIS LITIGATION IS GOING TO GO

17:59.306 --> 18:00.773
ON FOR A WHILE AND THERE'S A

18:00.840 --> 18:02.172
VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT WE

18:02.239 --> 18:03.306
MIGHT SEE AN INJUNCTION FROM A

18:03.373 --> 18:08.406
COURT LIKE WE DID ON THE MUSLIM

18:08.473 --> 18:08.606
BAND.

18:08.673 --> 18:12.072
>> Bill: THEN IT WILL GO TO

18:12.139 --> 18:14.306
THE SUPREME COURT AND THAT'S

18:14.373 --> 18:16.573
WHEN SCHLITZ KAVANAUGH WILL GO

18:16.640 --> 18:20.573
"TOTALLY BEHIND YOU, BRO."

18:20.640 --> 18:21.873
>> THE PRESIDENT LIT HIS OWN

18:21.939 --> 18:25.840
HAIR ON FIRE AND THERE'S A LOT

18:25.906 --> 18:26.840
OF HAIR SPRAY THERE.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.806
HE WILL REGRET THIS BECAUSE

18:27.873 --> 18:30.072
HERE'S SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO

18:30.139 --> 18:30.306
HAPPEN.

18:30.373 --> 18:31.706
THE LAW GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE

18:31.773 --> 18:33.640
POWER NOT TO CREATE NEW MONEY

18:33.706 --> 18:35.239
BUT TO RESHUFFLE OLD MONEY.

18:35.306 --> 18:36.640
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO COME FROM

18:36.706 --> 18:38.439
PEOPLE, HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO

18:38.506 --> 18:40.439
MOVE IT FROM ONE ALREADY

18:40.506 --> 18:41.640
APPROVED MILITARY PROJECT THAT

18:41.706 --> 18:43.473
HASN'T BEEN CONTRACTED YOU HAVE

18:43.539 --> 18:44.239
TO ANOTHER.

18:44.306 --> 18:46.106
SENATOR TOM TILLIS FROM

18:46.172 --> 18:47.406
NORTH CAROLINA CAME OUT AGAINST

18:47.473 --> 18:49.806
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION, WHY?

18:49.873 --> 18:52.606
BECAUSE CAROLINA HAS

18:52.673 --> 18:53.606
$350 MILLION OF MILITARY

18:53.673 --> 18:54.406
PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE.

18:54.473 --> 18:56.673
THE STATE OF MISSOURI HAS MORE

18:56.740 --> 18:58.840
THAN $320 MILLION IN THE

18:58.906 --> 19:00.239
PIPELINE.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.039
THOSE PROJECTS WERE FOUGHT FOR

19:01.106 --> 19:02.539
BY SENATORS AND THEY ARE ABOUT

19:02.606 --> 19:03.339
TO BE TAKEN AWAY.

19:03.406 --> 19:05.439
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO FACE A

19:05.506 --> 19:06.439
RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL FROM

19:06.506 --> 19:08.273
CONGRESS, THE HOUSE, AND THE

19:08.306 --> 19:08.706
SENATE TOO.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.773
I THINK THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC AND

19:11.840 --> 19:17.072
SENATORS THAT ARE UNHAPPY IT MAY

19:17.139 --> 19:17.273
PASS.

19:17.339 --> 19:17.906
THE COURT CHALLENGES ARE GOING

19:17.972 --> 19:21.072
TO BE PAINFUL.

19:21.139 --> 19:22.706
>> Bill: I'VE HEARD THIS SO

19:22.773 --> 19:23.373
MANY TIMES HE CAN'T GET AWAY

19:23.439 --> 19:24.172
WITH THIS AND HE ALWAYS GETS

19:24.239 --> 19:26.439
AWAY WITH IT.

19:26.506 --> 19:28.006
>> HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY WITH

19:28.072 --> 19:29.506
IT, THE BOAT IS TAKING ON WATER

19:29.573 --> 19:33.273
VERY STEADILY.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.039
>> I THINK THEY WILL DISAPPROVE

19:35.106 --> 19:35.640
AND THE PRESIDENT WILL VETO,

19:35.706 --> 19:40.039
THEN THERE WILL BE A VOTE TO

19:40.106 --> 19:40.840
OVERRIDE.

19:40.906 --> 19:41.706
HE HASN'T VETOED ANYTHING YET.

19:41.773 --> 19:47.339
IT'S ME WHEN THEY SEVEN.

19:47.406 --> 19:50.172
>> HE WILL REGRET THIS, THEY

19:50.239 --> 19:51.539
HAVE CHECKED THEM FROM TIME TO

19:51.606 --> 19:54.439
TIME WITH THE MUSLIM BAN.

19:54.506 --> 19:55.906
THE COURT HAS CHECKED THE

19:55.972 --> 19:58.406
PRESIDENCY, CONGRESS HAS YET TO

19:58.473 --> 19:59.072
DO SO.

19:59.139 --> 20:01.006
THE BIGGEST BULK OF THAT MONEY

20:01.072 --> 20:01.439
IS FROM THE MILITARY

20:01.506 --> 20:04.006
CONSTRUCTION BUDGET.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.006
THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES

20:06.072 --> 20:08.539
SUBCOMMITTEE HAD A HEARING THIS

20:08.606 --> 20:11.172
WEEK ABOUT MILITARY HOUSING.

20:11.239 --> 20:14.573
THEY HAD FAMILIES OF OUR TROOPS

20:14.640 --> 20:19.139
LIVING IN RAT INFESTED, MICE

20:19.206 --> 20:22.873
INFESTED, MOLDY HOUSING.

20:22.939 --> 20:24.473
HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY

20:24.539 --> 20:27.006
AWAY FROM THAT FOR HIS STUPID

20:27.072 --> 20:27.206
WALL?

20:27.273 --> 20:31.673
OUR BELOVED TROOPS ARE LIVING IN

20:31.740 --> 20:33.640
WORSE THAN THE SERVICE QUARTERS

20:33.706 --> 20:35.072
AT THE MAR-A-LAGO.

20:35.139 --> 20:35.606
>> Bill: CONSIDERING OUR

20:35.673 --> 20:36.539
DEFENSE BUDGET APPROACH IS A

20:36.606 --> 20:38.339
TRILLION DOLLARS, THAT'S

20:38.406 --> 20:39.506
RIDICULOUS TO BEGIN WITH.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.339
>> DID YOU SEE THE INTERVIEW

20:41.406 --> 20:42.939
WITH THE WOMAN WHO IS THE

20:43.006 --> 20:44.039
PLAINTIFF IN THE PUBLIC CITIZEN

20:44.106 --> 20:46.339
LAWSUIT TO FILED TODAY?

20:46.406 --> 20:47.606
SHE LIVES IN TEXAS, SHE'S ONE OF

20:47.673 --> 20:47.873
THE LAND

20:47.939 --> 20:52.106
LANDOWNERS WHO IS GOOO

20:52.172 --> 20:54.306
LOSE HER PROPERTY TO EMINENT

20:54.373 --> 20:56.306
DOMAIN.

20:56.373 --> 20:58.373
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO GAVE A

20:58.439 --> 21:01.306
PARDON TO MILITIAMEN WHO DID

21:01.373 --> 21:02.906
THIS FEDERAL ACTION IN OREGON TO

21:02.972 --> 21:03.506
PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY AND YET

21:03.573 --> 21:05.039
HE IS GOING TO GO ALONG THE

21:05.106 --> 21:07.406
BORDER AND TAKE PROPERTY.

21:07.473 --> 21:10.239
>> TRUMP IS TRAPPED INSIDE A

21:10.306 --> 21:12.106
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER DECISION

21:12.172 --> 21:13.539
SPIRAL, THIS IS HAPPENED TO HIM

21:13.606 --> 21:14.506
WHERE HE SOLVES A PROBLEM BY

21:14.573 --> 21:17.439
CREATING THE NEXT PROBLEM.

21:17.506 --> 21:19.473
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT CON MEN

21:19.539 --> 21:22.706
DO.

21:23.039 --> 21:23.939
THEY SELL YOU THE USED CAR

21:24.039 --> 21:25.239
KNOWING IT'S GOING TO BREAK DOWN

21:25.306 --> 21:27.306
WHEN YOU'RE 20 MILES DOWN THE

21:27.373 --> 21:29.773
ROAD.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.706
>> THE INTERVALS ARE GETTING

21:30.773 --> 21:33.239
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER.

21:33.306 --> 21:33.773
HE'S FINDING HIMSELF AND

21:33.840 --> 21:38.640
IN ANR

21:38.706 --> 21:39.506
MORE INESCAPABLE SITUATION, 2019

21:39.573 --> 21:42.339
IS GOING TO BE INCREASING

21:42.406 --> 21:43.873
HOPEFULNESS ABOUT WHAT IS AHEAD.

21:43.939 --> 21:47.072
I'M NOT AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE

21:47.139 --> 21:48.439
BUT YOU FEEL LIKE THE SPIRIT IS

21:48.506 --> 21:50.873
SURGING IN THE COUNTRY AND

21:50.939 --> 21:54.206
CONGRESS -- IS NOT GOING TO BE

21:54.273 --> 21:55.939
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL, THEIR

21:56.006 --> 21:57.339
COMMITMENT TO PORK BARREL

21:57.406 --> 21:58.339
PROJECTS, HE'S FOOLING WITH

21:58.406 --> 21:58.939
PORK BARREL PROJECTS THAT'S A

21:59.006 --> 22:02.539
DANGEROUS THING TO DO.

22:02.606 --> 22:04.339
>> I'M LESS OPTIMISTIC, HE HAS

22:04.406 --> 22:05.806
EMBARKED ON A STRATEGY WHICH IS

22:05.873 --> 22:08.139
THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAT I WOULD

22:08.239 --> 22:09.373
ADVISE.

22:09.439 --> 22:12.773
46% IN THE ELECTION, HE HASN'T

22:12.840 --> 22:13.373
SEEN $0.46.

22:13.439 --> 22:15.039
HE IS DRILLING DOWN DEEPER AND

22:15.106 --> 22:16.806
DEEPER IT MAKES NO SENSE UNLESS

22:16.873 --> 22:18.806
WHAT YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR IS A

22:18.873 --> 22:19.406
FANATICAL BASE THAT WILL STAND

22:19.473 --> 22:21.373
WITH HIM.

22:21.439 --> 22:22.840
>> Bill: YOU'RE THINKING OF

22:22.906 --> 22:24.606
CHANGING THE MEANS OF GOVERNMENT

22:24.673 --> 22:26.206
THAT WE FUNDAMENTALLY HAVE.

22:26.273 --> 22:27.706
WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS ASIDE

22:27.773 --> 22:28.873
FROM ALL OF THIS MY NEW SHOW IS

22:28.939 --> 22:30.006
THAT EVERY PRESIDENT HAS A THING

22:30.072 --> 22:33.006
THEY WANT TO GET THROUGH.

22:33.072 --> 22:33.972
BUSH WANTED TO PRIVATIZE

22:34.039 --> 22:35.006
SOCIAL SECURITY IN CLINTON

22:35.072 --> 22:36.806
WANTED TO REVAMP THE HEALTH CARE

22:36.873 --> 22:37.873
SYSTEM AND OBAMA WANTED A GRAND

22:37.939 --> 22:39.473
BARGAIN AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT

22:39.539 --> 22:42.172
BUT THEY DIDN'T DECLARE A

22:42.239 --> 22:42.972
NATIONAL EMERGENCY.

22:43.039 --> 22:44.773
THIS IS A MOVEMENT TOWARD A

22:44.840 --> 22:46.373
DIFFERENT KIND OF GOVERNMENT AND

22:46.439 --> 22:48.972
AS LONG AS MITCH McCONNELL --

22:49.039 --> 22:51.939
WHO IS MORE OF AN ENEMY OF THE

22:52.006 --> 22:53.773
CONSTITUTION THAT MITCH

22:53.840 --> 22:54.072
McCONNELL?

22:54.139 --> 22:55.573
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY.

22:56.106 --> 22:57.806
AS LONG AS THEY ARE SUPPORTING

22:57.873 --> 22:59.773
THIS THEY ARE SUPPORTING

22:59.840 --> 23:00.273
SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY

23:00.339 --> 23:00.606
UNDEMOCRATIC.

23:00.673 --> 23:02.673
>> THEY ARE COMPLICIT, ON

23:02.740 --> 23:03.706
SOMETHING THEY DON'T EVEN WANT

23:03.773 --> 23:05.106
TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

23:05.172 --> 23:05.972
GIVE UP THE POWER.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.306
>> Bill: NOT ONLY ARE WE

23:07.373 --> 23:09.806
FIGHTING THE WRONG WAR AT THE

23:09.873 --> 23:11.606
BORDER, THIS WEEK WE FOUND OUT

23:11.673 --> 23:13.006
WE ARE DELIBERATELY TAKING MONEY

23:13.072 --> 23:15.006
FROM A CYBER SECURITY AND

23:15.072 --> 23:15.640
INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCY, I DIDN'T

23:15.706 --> 23:17.673
KNOW THIS EXISTED.

23:17.740 --> 23:20.373
AS IT IS A TASK FORCE?

23:20.439 --> 23:22.840
>> IT'S A TASK FORCE, JAY

23:22.906 --> 23:23.706
JOHNSON CREATED IT.

23:23.773 --> 23:25.206
>> Bill: THIS IS TO PROTECT

23:25.273 --> 23:26.740
OUR ELECTIONS FROM THE RUSSIANS

23:26.806 --> 23:29.539
EMMA BASICALLY, BUT FROM ANYONE

23:29.606 --> 23:33.806
WHO WOULD WANT TO RAT FUCK THEM.

23:33.873 --> 23:36.539
IT COULD GET WORSE LATER IN THE

23:36.606 --> 23:37.939
SHOW, I'M SORRY.

23:38.273 --> 23:41.339
>> I'LL HOLD ONTO MY MUG.

23:41.406 --> 23:44.106
>> Bill: HE HASN'T SPENT ANY

23:44.172 --> 23:46.239
OF THE HUNDRED $20 MILLION IT'S

23:46.306 --> 23:46.972
ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATE TO

23:47.039 --> 23:51.806
PROTECT OUR ELECTIONS, THIS IS

23:51.873 --> 23:54.606
IS -- SOMEONE WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

23:54.673 --> 23:55.439
DEFENDING IT.

23:55.506 --> 23:57.273
>> MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS

23:57.339 --> 23:58.673
ESTABLISHES HIM, WE ALREADY KNEW

23:58.740 --> 23:59.906
THIS SO I'M NOT BREAKING ANY

23:59.972 --> 24:02.339
NEWS HERE BUT AS DISTRACTOR IN

24:02.406 --> 24:04.740
CHIEF.

24:04.806 --> 24:06.773
IT'S A DISTRACTING DEPARTMENT OF

24:06.840 --> 24:09.239
HOMELAND SECURITY FROM

24:09.306 --> 24:09.840
CYBERSECURITY OF OUR ELECTIONS

24:09.906 --> 24:11.840
TO A BORDER WHILE WE DON'T NEED.

24:11.906 --> 24:13.339
>> Bill: THE WALL IS BETTER

24:13.406 --> 24:18.439
THAN A SEX SCANDAL.

24:18.773 --> 24:20.039
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BORED WITH

24:20.106 --> 24:23.039
HIS SEX LIFE, THEY KNOW HE'S A

24:23.106 --> 24:23.806
SCUMBAG.

24:23.873 --> 24:26.273
>> 19 WOMEN STARTED MAKING IT

24:26.339 --> 24:27.072
OLD.

24:27.139 --> 24:29.306
>> HE DOES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

24:29.373 --> 24:30.706
PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND I'M GLAD

24:30.773 --> 24:33.473
YOU CALLED IT AN INVASION.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.072
IN THE MEDIA TOO OFTEN THEY CALL

24:35.139 --> 24:37.106
IT MEDDLING, LIKE ITS

24:37.172 --> 24:38.306
GAMESMANSHIP.

24:38.373 --> 24:39.373
>> Bill: LIKE YOUR

24:39.439 --> 24:39.706
MOTHER-IN-LAW.

24:39.773 --> 24:41.673
>> JOHN McCAIN A WAR HERO,

24:41.740 --> 24:43.706
CALLED IT AN INVASION, AN ATTACK

24:43.773 --> 24:45.072
AGAINST AMERICA.

24:45.139 --> 24:46.873
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT DEFENDING

24:46.939 --> 24:47.840
US, WHY?

24:47.906 --> 24:49.906
HE BENEFITED FROM THAT ATTACK.

24:49.972 --> 24:50.939
THEY OUGHT TO JUST ELIMINATE THE

24:51.006 --> 24:54.406
MIDDLEMAN AND PAY HIM IN RUBLES.

24:54.473 --> 24:57.473
>> Bill: MANAFORT HIS CAMPAIGN

24:57.539 --> 24:58.473
MANAGER, HE WAS LYING AFTER THEY

24:58.539 --> 24:59.573
MADE THE PLEA DEAL!

24:59.640 --> 25:03.506
>> NOT JUST LYING.

25:03.573 --> 25:05.439
LYING IS BAD, GOING IN TELLING

25:05.506 --> 25:07.406
THE PRESIDENT AND HAVING

25:07.473 --> 25:10.106
COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM WHILE

25:10.172 --> 25:11.873
YOU ARE SUPPOSEDLY COOPERATING

25:11.939 --> 25:14.039
AFTER A PLEA DEAL WITH FEDERAL

25:14.106 --> 25:17.106
INVESTIGATORS, THAT'S WHERE YOU

25:17.172 --> 25:18.906
START TO SEE THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL

25:18.972 --> 25:19.172
EVIDENCE.

25:19.239 --> 25:20.673
>> Bill: THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER,

25:20.740 --> 25:24.139
THE PERSONAL LAWYER FOR HIM, AND

25:24.206 --> 25:25.406
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

25:25.473 --> 25:27.306
ALL CONVICTED OF LYING ABOUT

25:27.373 --> 25:29.273
RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS.

25:29.339 --> 25:31.106
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT HE DIDN'T

25:31.172 --> 25:32.239
KNOW WHEN THE KEY PEOPLE AROUND

25:32.306 --> 25:35.906
HIM WERE ALL DOING THIS?

25:35.972 --> 25:37.972
>> YOU HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THE

25:38.039 --> 25:39.139
WORD "CONVICTED."

25:39.206 --> 25:40.806
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WALLS

25:40.873 --> 25:43.506
CLOSING IN, THE AMERICAN LEGAL

25:43.573 --> 25:45.306
SYSTEM HAS WORKED ABOUT AS WELL

25:45.373 --> 25:46.373
AS ANYBODY COULD HAVE HOPED AND

25:46.439 --> 25:48.072
IT CONTINUES TO WORK.

25:48.139 --> 25:49.706
BOB MUELLER STAYS ON THE JOB.

25:49.773 --> 25:50.740
HERE YOU ARE EVERY WEEK WORRYING

25:50.806 --> 25:53.172
ABOUT WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO

25:53.239 --> 25:55.539
MUELLER AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED

25:55.606 --> 25:56.939
YET.

25:57.006 --> 25:59.339
FOR ALL OF US, FATE ISN'T DYING

25:59.406 --> 25:59.939
THAT DAY, MUELLER DIDN'T DIE

26:00.006 --> 26:03.106
THAT DAY.

26:03.172 --> 26:04.239
AT THIS POINT WITH THE HOUSE OF

26:04.306 --> 26:05.106
REPRESENTATIVES AND DEMOCRATIC

26:05.172 --> 26:07.740
HANDS, HE HAS MISSED HIS WINDOW.

26:07.806 --> 26:08.339
THAT TIGHTENING SPIRAL IS

26:08.406 --> 26:10.939
CONTINUING TO TIGHTEN.

26:11.006 --> 26:13.339
>> Bill: WE GOT A NEW

26:13.406 --> 26:14.606
ATTORNEY GENERAL TODAY, RIGHT?

26:14.673 --> 26:18.539
THE LAST GUY WAS A TEMP.

26:18.606 --> 26:20.939
TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT

26:21.006 --> 26:22.506
NORMAL.

26:22.573 --> 26:22.939
THAT WHITAKER GUY?

26:23.006 --> 26:26.506
THEY GOT HIM FROM MANPOWER.

26:26.573 --> 26:28.439
THE WEEK BEFORE HE WAS

26:28.506 --> 26:28.906
INSTALLING DRAINPIPES.

26:28.972 --> 26:33.506
>> WHITAKER WHO HAS A HIGHLY

26:33.573 --> 26:35.439
ABNORMAL APPROACH, HE WAS SHUT

26:35.506 --> 26:36.039
DOWN.

26:36.106 --> 26:39.939
HE'S NOT THERE.

26:40.006 --> 26:41.740
BOB BAR -- BILL BARR IS A NORMAL

26:41.806 --> 26:44.139
FIGURE WHO HAS A LONG CAREER

26:44.206 --> 26:46.072
AHEAD OF THEM.

26:46.139 --> 26:50.172
>> Bill: SO WHAT?

26:50.239 --> 26:52.373
COME ON, SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE

26:52.439 --> 26:53.972
ARE NORMAL, NORMAL, THEN ONE DAY

26:54.039 --> 26:55.773
IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT

26:55.840 --> 26:56.306
PERSON?

26:56.373 --> 26:57.773
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS NORMAL FOR A

26:57.840 --> 26:59.039
WHILE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE

26:59.106 --> 27:01.239
NORMAL AND THEN THEY GET SUCKED

27:01.306 --> 27:03.172
INTO THE FOX NEWS VORTEX OR

27:03.239 --> 27:03.806
SOMETHING AND THEY BECOME VERY

27:03.873 --> 27:05.939
NOT NORMAL.

27:06.006 --> 27:09.373
>> THE STORY OF THE TRUMP YEARS

27:09.439 --> 27:10.306
INSTITUTIONALLY AS THE MASSIVE

27:10.373 --> 27:12.373
FAILURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,

27:12.439 --> 27:15.139
IT'S TRUE.

27:15.206 --> 27:16.439
THAT'S THE MOST SHAMEFUL STORY.

27:16.506 --> 27:20.840
THE MOST INSPIRING STORY IS THE

27:20.906 --> 27:22.172
AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM, THE

27:22.239 --> 27:23.740
JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS AND TELL

27:23.806 --> 27:26.006
THEY HAVE PROTECTED ONE ANOTHER.

27:26.072 --> 27:27.006
THEY HAVE FUTURES BEYOND

27:27.072 --> 27:27.706
DONALD TRUMP.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.873
THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS WORKED, THE

27:29.939 --> 27:31.406
POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS FAILED.

27:31.473 --> 27:32.606
>> Bill: VALENTINE'S DAY WAS

27:32.673 --> 27:35.573
YESTERDAY, DID YOU HAVE A GOOD

27:35.640 --> 27:35.773
TIME?

27:35.840 --> 27:37.972
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD SAVE THIS,

27:38.039 --> 27:38.573
IT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND THE

27:38.640 --> 27:41.439
INTERNET FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

27:41.506 --> 27:42.773
IT'S AN AMAZING STORY.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.039
A MAN BOUGHT A USED CAR AND HE

27:45.106 --> 27:46.673
FOUND SOMETHING LEFT IN THE CAR,

27:46.740 --> 27:50.606
A LIST OF 22 RELATIONSHIP RULES

27:50.673 --> 27:52.006
THAT THE PREVIOUS CAR OWNERS

27:52.072 --> 27:52.640
GIRLFRIEND HAD LAID OUT FOR HIM

27:52.706 --> 27:59.473
AND HE POSTED IT ONLINE.

27:59.539 --> 28:00.506
THINGS LIKE:

28:00.573 --> 28:01.406
YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE

28:01.473 --> 28:02.373
GIRL'S PHONE NUMBER.

28:02.439 --> 28:03.273
YOU ARE NOT TO LOOK AT A SINGLE

28:03.339 --> 28:04.339
GIRL.

28:04.406 --> 28:05.439
I AM ALLOWED TO DO A PHONE CHECK

28:05.506 --> 28:08.106
WHEN EVER I PLEASE.

28:08.439 --> 28:09.306
YOU ARE NOT TO GET MAD AT ME

28:09.406 --> 28:10.673
ABOUT A SINGLE THING EVER AGAIN.

28:10.740 --> 28:12.239
YOU ARE TO NEVER TAKE LONGER

28:12.306 --> 28:14.239
THAN 10 MINS TO TEXT ME BACK.

28:14.306 --> 28:17.906
YOU ARE NOT TO ASK FOR HEAD.

28:17.972 --> 28:21.106
THIS IS REAL.

28:21.172 --> 28:22.740
APPARENTLY THIS IS CATCHING ON.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.706
A LOT OF WOMEN ARE DOING THIS

28:25.773 --> 28:30.039
NOW, WE GOT A HOLD OF MELANIA'S

28:30.106 --> 28:30.239
LIST.

28:30.306 --> 28:34.239
THESE ARE HER RULES.

28:34.306 --> 28:35.573
YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE YOUR GIRDLE

28:35.640 --> 28:37.239
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

28:37.306 --> 28:42.706
YOU ARE NOT TO ASK FOR HAND.

28:43.039 --> 28:44.072
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT

28:44.139 --> 28:47.072
WENDY'S IN BED.

28:47.406 --> 28:52.439
TELL WENDY I CAN HEAR HER.

28:52.773 --> 28:53.806
YOU ARE NOT TO EVER AGAIN

28:53.873 --> 28:55.406
MENTION THE BRIDE CATALOG'S

28:55.473 --> 29:00.640
"RETURN POLICY."

29:04.139 --> 29:04.906
HIS NAME IS BARRON AND HE'S OUR

29:04.972 --> 29:06.039
SON.

29:06.106 --> 29:11.740
STOP ASKING, "WHO'S THE KID?"

29:13.273 --> 29:14.239
YOU MUST AT LEAST CONSIDER

29:14.306 --> 29:15.373
DRINKING.

29:15.439 --> 29:16.473
OR WHATEVER WILL PUT YOU TO

29:16.539 --> 29:18.573
SLEEP.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.473
WHEN I SAY, "I LOVE YOU" DO NOT

29:20.539 --> 29:25.439
REPLY WITH, "YOU'RE WELCOME."

29:33.106 --> 29:33.806
IF I SAY JUMP, YOU...HA, I'D

29:33.873 --> 29:34.972
LIKE TO SEE THAT.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.339
HE'S AN ACTIVIST AND MUSICIAN

29:36.406 --> 29:39.439
WHOSE NEWEST SONG AND VIDEO

29:39.506 --> 29:41.473
"PREACH" IS OUT TODAY, HERE'S A

29:41.539 --> 29:45.172
LOOK:

29:55.606 --> 29:56.106

30:07.740 --> 30:09.806
>> Bill: JOHN LEGEND,

30:09.873 --> 30:12.006
EVERYBODY!

30:12.072 --> 30:16.273
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

30:16.339 --> 30:19.072
NOT ONLY A GREAT TALENT BUT A

30:19.139 --> 30:19.406
GREAT CITIZEN.

30:19.473 --> 30:20.139
YOU USE YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD AND

30:20.206 --> 30:23.673
NOT EVIL.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.306
IT'S A TERRIFIC NEW VIDEO AND A

30:25.406 --> 30:25.640
SONG.

30:25.706 --> 30:28.506
IF PEOPLE DON'T HEAR IT, SOME OF

30:28.573 --> 30:29.606
OUR AUDIENCES OLDER THAN LISTEN

30:29.673 --> 30:33.106
TO YOUNG PEOPLE MUSIC.

30:35.972 --> 30:36.606
WHAT WAS THE TAKE AWAY?

30:36.673 --> 30:40.139
>> IN THE SONG, WE HAD ANOTHER

30:40.206 --> 30:42.139
GUN MASSACRE TODAY IN AMERICA,

30:42.206 --> 30:43.139
AND ILLINOIS, EVERY TIME IT

30:43.206 --> 30:48.506
HAPPENS WE GET HOPES AND PRAYERS

30:48.573 --> 30:49.206
FROM OUR OFFICIALS AND THEY

30:49.273 --> 30:51.106
DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THE

30:51.172 --> 30:53.039
SONG IS SAYING WE'VE HAD ENOUGH

30:53.106 --> 30:54.306
OF THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AND

30:54.373 --> 30:56.606
TALKING ABOUT IT, LET'S DO

30:56.673 --> 30:58.172
SOMETHING.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.806
>> Bill: I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU,

31:04.873 --> 31:09.106
YOU ARE SO GOOD AS JESUS IN

31:09.172 --> 31:10.139
JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, YOU ARE

31:10.239 --> 31:11.873
BORN TO PLAY THAT PART.

31:11.939 --> 31:12.640
PEOPLE ALREADY THINK OF YOU AS A

31:12.706 --> 31:18.539
GREAT GUY.

31:18.606 --> 31:20.606
>> I AM THE SON AND GRANDSON OF

31:20.673 --> 31:21.573
PREACHERS, SO I'VE BEEN LEARNING

31:21.640 --> 31:23.039
ABOUT JESUS MY WHOLE LIFE.

31:23.106 --> 31:26.473
I GUESS IT WAS PREPARATION.

31:26.539 --> 31:28.506
>> Bill: I KNOW MASS

31:28.573 --> 31:33.539
INCARCERATION IS A BIG ISSUE, DO

31:33.606 --> 31:36.139
YOU THINK TRUMP GETS ANY CREDIT

31:36.206 --> 31:39.573
FOR -- HE DID GET A BILL PASSED,

31:39.640 --> 31:43.339
OF PRISON REFORM.

31:43.406 --> 31:43.873
HE ALWAYS SAYS NO ONE EVER

31:43.972 --> 31:46.072
WRITES ABOUT IT WHEN I DO

31:46.139 --> 31:49.873
SOMETHING GOOD, NO ONE NOTICES

31:49.939 --> 31:51.473
THE PRESS -- WE ARE MENTIONING

31:51.539 --> 31:53.406
IT NOW, OKAY?

31:53.473 --> 31:54.972
>> IT'S HARD TO CREDIT HIM

31:55.039 --> 31:55.873
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S IN

31:55.939 --> 31:58.573
THE BILL.

31:58.906 --> 32:00.172
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKED ON AND ON

32:00.239 --> 32:01.339
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND A

32:01.406 --> 32:05.373
LOT OF ACTIVISTS WORKED ON IT,

32:05.439 --> 32:06.840
IT'S APTLY NAMED "FIRST STEP"

32:06.906 --> 32:11.139
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FIRST

32:11.206 --> 32:11.873
STEPS THAT NEED TO GO BUT IT'S

32:11.939 --> 32:14.172
BETTER THAN NOT HAVING IT.

32:14.239 --> 32:17.406
>> Bill: WHEN HILLARY CLINTON

32:17.473 --> 32:19.573
RAN, HER FIRST SPEECH IN HER

32:19.640 --> 32:20.206
CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT MASS

32:20.273 --> 32:20.972
INCARCERATION.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.406
I THOUGHT WHEN THEY HUNG THAT

32:22.473 --> 32:24.773
SUPER PREDATOR ON HER, IT WAS

32:24.840 --> 32:25.006
UNFAIR.

32:25.072 --> 32:27.172
>> SHE SAID IT SO SHE HAS TO BE

32:27.239 --> 32:27.972
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT SHE SAID

32:28.039 --> 32:28.906
BUT I THINK THE PRESSURE THAT

32:28.972 --> 32:33.172
WAS PUT ON HER AND REALIZING

32:33.239 --> 32:34.972
THAT SHE HAD TO MOVE ON THE LEFT

32:35.039 --> 32:36.573
ON THAT ISSUE WAS BECAUSE OF THE

32:36.640 --> 32:36.840
PRESSURE.

32:36.906 --> 32:38.573
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR ACTIVISTS

32:38.640 --> 32:40.439
ON THE LEFT TO PRESSURE

32:40.506 --> 32:47.373
DEMOCRATS WHO IN THE 90s --

32:47.439 --> 32:48.806
>> Bill: THERE WAS A LOT MORE

32:48.873 --> 32:50.039
CRIME IN THE 90s ACCORDING TO

32:50.106 --> 32:51.573
THE CLINTON ON THIS SHE WAS THE

32:51.640 --> 32:53.539
FIRST LADY, SHE WAS IN THE

32:53.606 --> 32:54.906
PRESIDENT.

32:54.972 --> 33:00.873
THEY WERE SAYING THAT WORD IN

33:00.939 --> 33:01.939
RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY LEADERS.

33:02.006 --> 33:05.206
>> I THINK THE PRESSURE THE LEFT

33:05.273 --> 33:06.473
PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON WAS

33:06.539 --> 33:06.939
USEFUL.

33:07.006 --> 33:08.106
IT MOVED HER TO THE LEFT.

33:08.172 --> 33:09.473
>> Bill: SHE NEEDED TO BE

33:09.539 --> 33:12.206
MOVED TO THE LEFT ON THAT ISSUE?

33:12.273 --> 33:13.406
>> ABSOLUTELY.

33:13.473 --> 33:13.939
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

33:14.006 --> 33:18.206
NEEDED TO MOVE TO THE LEFT.

33:18.273 --> 33:19.806
WE ARE SEEING THEM BRING UP

33:19.873 --> 33:21.773
OTHER CANDIDATES FOR 2020, THE

33:21.840 --> 33:23.006
RECORD ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND I

33:23.072 --> 33:23.840
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR

33:23.906 --> 33:25.873
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT TO PUT

33:25.939 --> 33:26.539
PRESSURE ON THE POLITICIANS AND

33:26.573 --> 33:28.740
REQUIRE THEM TO STEP TO WHERE WE

33:28.806 --> 33:29.473
WANT THEM TO STEP.

33:29.539 --> 33:32.239
>> Bill: PART OF THE RESULT OF

33:32.306 --> 33:33.339
THAT AS I REMEMBER READING THE

33:33.406 --> 33:35.840
QUOTE FROM COLIN KAEPERNICK WHO

33:35.906 --> 33:36.673
SAID I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE

33:36.740 --> 33:38.873
BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH RACIST.

33:38.939 --> 33:43.239
>> THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

33:43.306 --> 33:44.139
>> Bill: BUT THAT'S WHAT

33:44.206 --> 33:44.373
HAPPENS.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.439
>> WE CAN HAVE BOTH, WE CAN SAY

33:47.506 --> 33:49.239
PUT PRESSURE TO THE LEFT ON OUR

33:49.306 --> 33:50.640
POLITICIANS BUT WHEN IT COMES

33:50.706 --> 33:52.239
DOWN TO THE DECISION, I VOTED

33:52.306 --> 33:54.239
FOR HILLARY CLINTON.

33:54.306 --> 33:57.906
I CAMPAIGNED FOR HILLARY CLINTON

33:57.972 --> 33:58.640
HILLARY CLINTON, I KNEW THE

33:58.706 --> 33:59.473
ALTERNATIVE WAS TRUMP.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.806
I THOUGHT HILLARY WAS A GREAT

34:01.873 --> 34:04.439
CANDIDATE BUT ALSO, IT WAS CLEAR

34:04.506 --> 34:05.139
THAT EVEN IF THERE WAS SOMEONE

34:05.206 --> 34:10.306
RUNNING ON A THIRD PARTY TO HER

34:10.406 --> 34:12.072
LEFT, I WOULDN'T HAVE VOTED FOR

34:12.139 --> 34:14.773
THAT PERSON, I WANTED THE BEST

34:14.840 --> 34:16.406
CANDIDATE WITH THE BEST CHANCE

34:16.473 --> 34:17.640
OF WINNING TO GET MY VOTE.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.806
>> Bill: I NOTICE YOU ARE THE

34:19.873 --> 34:23.606
ONLY BIG STAR IN THE R. KELLY

34:23.673 --> 34:24.373
RECENT DOCUMENTARY WE ALL

34:24.439 --> 34:27.840
WATCHED AND IT WAS PRETTY

34:27.906 --> 34:28.439
DAMNING.

34:28.506 --> 34:29.840
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

34:29.906 --> 34:32.273
ASKED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,

34:32.339 --> 34:33.473
WHEN IS THE #METOO MOVEMENT

34:33.539 --> 34:34.473
GOING TO COME TO THE MUSIC

34:34.539 --> 34:36.906
INDUSTRY AND I THINK A LOT OF

34:36.972 --> 34:38.072
PEOPLE ARE THINKING IS THAT'S SO

34:38.139 --> 34:39.273
UBIQUITOUS IN THE MUSIC

34:39.339 --> 34:41.740
INDUSTRY, WHERE WOULD YOU EVEN

34:41.806 --> 34:42.473
START?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.873
>> I DON'T KNOW, CLEARLY WE ARE

34:44.939 --> 34:46.273
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

34:46.339 --> 34:47.773
OUR KELLY, THERE'S ANOTHER

34:47.840 --> 34:50.273
ARTICLE THIS WEEK

34:50.339 --> 34:50.906
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," THERE'S A

34:50.972 --> 34:54.473
CONVERSATION BEING HAD.

34:54.539 --> 34:56.606
I THINK MUSIC IS MORE

34:56.673 --> 34:57.406
DECENTRALIZED SO --

34:57.473 --> 34:59.906
>> Bill: AND A SEXY!

34:59.972 --> 35:03.473
IT'S A SEXY THING.

35:03.539 --> 35:05.072
>> PARTICULARLY IN THE R. KELLY

35:05.139 --> 35:06.706
CASE THE REASON WHY IT WAS

35:06.773 --> 35:08.006
IGNORED FOR SO LONG, THE VICTIMS

35:08.072 --> 35:10.306
WERE PRETTY POWERLESS AND THEY

35:10.373 --> 35:11.906
DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE SPEAKING UP

35:11.972 --> 35:12.406
FOR THEM.

35:12.473 --> 35:13.906
THAT'S WHY I SPOKE UP.

35:13.972 --> 35:15.773
I HAD FRIENDS WHO WERE ACTIVISTS

35:15.840 --> 35:17.239
SPEAKING UP FOR THOSE VICTIMS

35:17.306 --> 35:19.373
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE

35:19.439 --> 35:23.473
IGNORING THEM.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.873
A GUY IN CHICAGO WAS SAYING AS A

35:24.939 --> 35:27.106
WHITE GUY I LEARNED BLACK WOMEN

35:27.172 --> 35:28.906
ARE THE LEAST VALUED IN SOCIETY.

35:28.972 --> 35:30.706
NO ONE CARED AND NO ONE PAID

35:30.773 --> 35:31.706
ATTENTION, THESE VICTIMS DIDN'T

35:31.773 --> 35:32.706
HAVE THE POWER, THEY DIDN'T HAVE

35:32.773 --> 35:35.873
THE STANDING TO GET ATTENTION

35:35.939 --> 35:38.006
PAID TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

35:38.072 --> 35:41.539
IT WAS GOOD THIS DOCUMENTARY AND

35:41.573 --> 35:48.539
PROPER ATTENTION.

35:48.606 --> 35:49.972
>> Bill: CAN WE STILL PLAY OUR

35:50.039 --> 35:52.740
KELLY AT A PARTY, WOULD THAT BE

35:52.806 --> 35:52.939
WRONG?

35:53.006 --> 35:55.906
>> I DON'T PLAY HIM.

35:55.972 --> 35:57.306
>> I DON'T EITHER.

35:57.373 --> 35:58.873
>> Bill: ME NEITHER,

35:58.939 --> 36:00.806
ABSOLUTELY NOT, OUT OF MY

36:00.873 --> 36:03.306
IPOD.

36:03.373 --> 36:05.339
>> WAS CHECKING YOUR iPOD ON

36:05.406 --> 36:05.606
THE LIST?

36:05.673 --> 36:08.740
>> Bill: NO.

36:08.806 --> 36:10.106
iPOD, I KNOW EVEN THAT'S

36:10.206 --> 36:12.406
DATING MYSELF BUT I STILL LIKE

36:12.473 --> 36:14.339
IT.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.539
WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR OF

36:16.606 --> 36:16.806
VIRGINIA?

36:16.873 --> 36:20.106
I ASKED RAHM EMANUEL AND LAST

36:20.172 --> 36:21.539
WEEK MALCOLM NANCE WAS HERE IF

36:21.606 --> 36:22.939
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BLACK

36:23.006 --> 36:23.840
OUTRAGE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK

36:23.939 --> 36:24.939
SOME BLACK FOLKS.

36:25.039 --> 36:29.806
I THINK THE DATA I CITED, 58% OF

36:29.873 --> 36:30.706
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN VIRGINIA

36:30.773 --> 36:33.373
BELIEVE HE SHOULD NOT STEP DOWN.

36:33.439 --> 36:35.406
YOUR FEELINGS, YOUR FEELINGS,

36:35.473 --> 36:37.339
YOUR FEELINGS, YOUR FEELINGS?

36:37.406 --> 36:38.539
>> I THINK BLACK PEOPLE ARE

36:38.606 --> 36:39.773
SHOCKED WHEN WE FIND OUT THAT

36:39.840 --> 36:41.139
FOLKS WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE

36:41.206 --> 36:41.972
SOMETHING LIKE THIS 30 YEARS AGO

36:42.039 --> 36:45.139
WERE PROBABLY THE LEAST SHOCKED.

36:45.206 --> 36:47.072
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY IT MORE

36:47.139 --> 36:47.740
POINTEDLY BECAUSE THE

36:47.806 --> 36:49.172
CONVERSATION I WAS JUST VISITING

36:49.239 --> 36:51.573
MY FRIEND WHO LIVES IN VIRGINIA

36:51.640 --> 36:52.773
AND OUR CONVERSATION WAS LIKE

36:52.840 --> 36:54.806
WHY DO WHITE PEOPLE THINK BLACK

36:54.873 --> 36:59.406
PEOPLE TRUST THEM?

37:01.039 --> 37:03.072
OUR LITMUS TEST IS WE DON'T

37:03.139 --> 37:04.239
TRUST YOU SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY

37:04.306 --> 37:08.439
WAITING TO SEE IF YOU'RE GOING

37:08.506 --> 37:09.640
TO DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING

37:09.706 --> 37:10.972
TO DO.

37:11.039 --> 37:12.106
IN THIS CASE, I THINK THAT'S

37:12.172 --> 37:16.773
PART OF WHY YOU SAY 58% SAYING

37:16.840 --> 37:18.006
WE DIDN'T TRUST YOU IN THE FIRST

37:18.072 --> 37:19.006
PLACE, WE WANT YOU TO MAKE GOOD

37:19.072 --> 37:19.906
ON WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING

37:19.972 --> 37:24.106
TO DO WHICH WAS ELIMINATE VOTER

37:24.172 --> 37:27.939
I.D. WHICH DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

37:28.006 --> 37:30.072
US IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO

37:30.139 --> 37:31.939
VOTE DISPROPORTIONATELY, YOU ARE

37:32.006 --> 37:34.006
GOING TO DO CRIMINAL JUSTICE

37:34.072 --> 37:35.439
REFORM IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA,

37:35.506 --> 37:36.773
WE WANT YOU TO MAKE GOOD ON WHAT

37:36.840 --> 37:38.072
YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND

37:38.139 --> 37:39.806
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOUR FEET TO

37:39.873 --> 37:40.606
THE FIRE.

37:40.673 --> 37:41.640
I ALSO THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

37:41.706 --> 37:44.573
RIGHT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO BE

37:44.640 --> 37:44.840
OUTRAGED.

37:44.906 --> 37:47.072
IT ISN'T BECAUSE HE WORE BLACK

37:47.139 --> 37:49.373
FACE IN THAT PHOTO OR THE

37:49.439 --> 37:50.006
KU KLUX KLAN COSTUME, HE DIDN'T

37:50.072 --> 37:52.573
EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.706
IT IS IMPERATIVE WE HAVE A

37:53.773 --> 37:56.773
DISCUSSION THAT SAYS HOW WE

37:56.873 --> 37:57.573
EVOLVE.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.006
THERE'S SO MUCH RACISM IN THIS

37:59.072 --> 38:00.172
COUNTRY, THAT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

38:00.239 --> 38:02.339
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

38:02.406 --> 38:05.406
HERE IS HOW I LEARNED THAT THAT

38:05.473 --> 38:05.740
WAS WRONG.

38:05.806 --> 38:08.006
>> Bill: BECAUSE PEOPLE LOSE

38:08.072 --> 38:10.006
THEIR CAREERS, MEGYN KELLY LOST

38:10.072 --> 38:11.806
HER CAREER.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.406
>> SHE HAD BAD RATINGS.

38:13.473 --> 38:15.606
>> Bill: THAT'S TRUE TOO.

38:16.239 --> 38:18.373
AND SHE SAID SANTA WAS A WHITE

38:18.439 --> 38:21.006
MAN.

38:21.072 --> 38:23.139
>> Bill: HE DOES LIVE AT THE

38:23.206 --> 38:24.573
NORTH POLE.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.573
LIAM NEESON SAID SOMETHING LAST

38:26.640 --> 38:27.972
WEEK.

38:28.039 --> 38:32.840
THERE'S A BIG BACKLASH.

38:32.906 --> 38:34.039
I REMEMBER WHEN CLINTON WAS

38:34.106 --> 38:35.473
PRESIDENT HE SAID WE HAVE TO

38:35.539 --> 38:37.239
HAVE A DIALOGUE ON RACE, I

38:37.306 --> 38:38.706
REMEMBER OBAMA HAD THE BEER

38:38.773 --> 38:40.439
SUMMIT AND IT'S LIKE WE NEED TO

38:40.506 --> 38:41.206
TALK.

38:41.273 --> 38:42.406
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE CREATING

38:42.473 --> 38:43.473
AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL

38:43.539 --> 38:45.039
SAFE TO TALK.

38:45.106 --> 38:46.473
I THINK THAT PUTS US IN THE

38:46.539 --> 38:46.840
WRONG DIRECTION.

38:46.906 --> 38:48.840
I THINK DIALOGUE AND TALKING WAS

38:48.906 --> 38:50.239
WHERE THE DIRECTION SHOULD GO.

38:50.306 --> 38:52.239
NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE LIKE I

38:52.306 --> 38:52.873
SHOULD JUST SHUT UP BECAUSE I'M

38:52.939 --> 38:56.106
JUST GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE BY

38:56.172 --> 38:56.906
SAY ANYTHING.

38:56.972 --> 38:59.139
>> I'M EXCITED BECAUSE THE

38:59.206 --> 39:00.006
VIRGINIA G.O.P. SAID RACISTS

39:00.072 --> 39:01.473
DON'T BELONG IN OFFICE SO I HAVE

39:01.539 --> 39:02.606
A GOOD FEELING A LOT OF PEOPLE

39:02.673 --> 39:06.673
ARE GOING TO RESIGN.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.239
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL RESIGN.

39:08.306 --> 39:08.873
IF

39:08.939 --> 39:09.939
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

39:10.006 --> 39:12.273
GOING TO RESIGN BECAUSE THE

39:12.339 --> 39:13.840
G.O.P. HAS DECIDED RACISTS DON'T

39:13.906 --> 39:14.640
BELONG AT OFFICE, I'M EXCITED

39:14.706 --> 39:17.039
FOR THE TURNOVER.

39:17.106 --> 39:19.706
>> WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO THE

39:19.773 --> 39:20.473
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABOUT YOUR

39:20.539 --> 39:21.640
INITIATIVE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE

39:21.706 --> 39:22.273
REFORM, IT MUST HAVE HELPED YOU

39:22.339 --> 39:26.773
THAT SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE

39:26.840 --> 39:28.072
TALKING COME OUT LIKE I MIGHT BE

39:28.139 --> 39:30.773
A FELON ONE OF THESE DAYS.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.906
>> DAD WAS IN PRISON AND HE TOOK

39:32.972 --> 39:34.573
UP THE CAUSE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

39:34.640 --> 39:37.273
REFORM BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE,

39:37.339 --> 39:38.873
I THINK HE HAD THE FEELING HE

39:38.939 --> 39:42.106
MIGHT BE INDICTED HIMSELF, WHO

39:42.172 --> 39:44.273
KNOWS?

39:44.339 --> 39:44.939
>> GOVERNOR NORTHAM IS A FRIEND

39:45.006 --> 39:47.473
OF MINE.

39:47.539 --> 39:50.706
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS HE

39:50.773 --> 39:51.473
GOT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IN

39:51.539 --> 39:54.573
THE CAMPAIGN AND NOW 58% OF

39:54.640 --> 39:55.072
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN HIS

39:55.139 --> 39:56.539
COMMONWEALTH DON'T WANT HIM TO

39:56.606 --> 39:56.773
RESIGN.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.473
I ALSO THINK PEOPLE WOULD PREFER

40:00.539 --> 40:02.873
REDEMPTION TO RESIGNATION.

40:02.939 --> 40:04.706
IF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AS I

40:04.773 --> 40:07.539
DO, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE 35

40:07.606 --> 40:08.906
YEARS SINCE THOSE OFFENSIVE,

40:08.972 --> 40:10.106
RACIST PICTURES, NOTHING TO

40:10.139 --> 40:12.139
SUGGEST HE'S STILL THAT PERSON.

40:12.206 --> 40:15.706
HE PASSED MEDICAID WHICH

40:15.773 --> 40:16.339
DISPROPORTIONATELY HELPS

40:16.406 --> 40:17.606
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HE WAS THE

40:17.673 --> 40:19.139
FIRST WHITE POLITICIAN IN

40:19.206 --> 40:21.006
VIRGINIA THAT I KNOW OF TO CALL

40:21.072 --> 40:22.106
FOR THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS TO

40:22.172 --> 40:23.506
COME DOWN AND NOW HE HAS PLEDGED

40:23.573 --> 40:25.239
TO REDEEM HIMSELF MORE.

40:25.306 --> 40:28.806
>> WAIT.

40:28.873 --> 40:30.873
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING

40:30.939 --> 40:31.673
HERE.

40:31.740 --> 40:33.573
YES, REDEMPTION, TO THE POINT

40:33.640 --> 40:34.573
ABOUT THE DISCUSSION, THE

40:34.640 --> 40:35.740
DISCUSSION HAVE TO BE A

40:35.806 --> 40:38.539
REDEMPTIVE DISCUSSION.

40:38.606 --> 40:39.873
HIS PROBLEM AND I'M NOT SAYING

40:39.939 --> 40:41.506
THIS BECAUSE I THINK HE SHOULD

40:41.573 --> 40:43.939
RESIGN, I AGREE, IT 58% OF BLACK

40:44.006 --> 40:45.273
VOTERS WANT HIM TO STAY, I'M NOT

40:45.339 --> 40:49.640
GOING TO TELL THEM HE SHOULDN'T.

40:49.706 --> 40:51.406
BUT, MOONWALKING AND THAT

40:51.473 --> 40:54.972
DESCRIPTION OF THE TAR, THAT WAS

40:55.039 --> 40:56.773
THE DEMONSTRATION THAT HE HAS

40:56.806 --> 41:03.339
NOT LEARNED.

41:03.406 --> 41:04.573
>> AS A WATCHER OF POLITICS, I

41:04.640 --> 41:07.706
WAS LIKE HE IS A GOOD POLITICIAN

41:07.773 --> 41:09.506
POLITICIAN.

41:09.573 --> 41:10.539
>> Bill: HE'S JUST AN IDIOT.

41:10.606 --> 41:12.972
>> I THOUGHT THE GOVERNOR OF THE

41:13.039 --> 41:13.939
COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA SHOULD

41:14.006 --> 41:16.239
BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT

41:16.306 --> 41:17.539
POLITICS.

41:17.606 --> 41:19.273
>> THE CONVERSATION I WANT IS

41:19.339 --> 41:20.740
AND THIS GOES BACK TO LIAM

41:20.806 --> 41:20.972
NEESON.

41:21.039 --> 41:23.773
IT WAS AWFUL THAT HE THOUGHT AND

41:23.840 --> 41:28.573
FELT WHAT HE DID, THAT WAS

41:28.640 --> 41:29.039
REPREHENSIBLE.

41:29.106 --> 41:32.706
WE CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION BY

41:32.773 --> 41:34.640
TWITTER OR AN OFFHANDED COMMENT

41:34.706 --> 41:37.906
BECAUSE IT IS SO PAINFUL.

41:37.972 --> 41:39.139
>> Bill: EVERYTHING GETS ON

41:39.206 --> 41:39.740
TWITTER, WE HAVE TO LEARN TO

41:39.806 --> 41:42.072
IGNORE TWITTER.

41:42.139 --> 41:45.972
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

41:46.039 --> 41:48.373
HOW DO YOU CREATE A CONVERSATION

41:48.439 --> 41:53.473
THAT ACKNOWLEDGES, THESE ARE NOT

41:53.539 --> 41:54.006
HYPOTHETICAL CONVERSATIONS

41:54.072 --> 41:55.406
BECAUSE WE HAD TREE OF LIFE

41:55.473 --> 41:56.573
SYNAGOGUE.

41:56.640 --> 42:00.773
WE HAD A MANUAL AME CHURCH.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.506
PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE OF THE

42:03.573 --> 42:05.373
STEREOTYPICAL TROPES, SO IT'S

42:05.439 --> 42:06.006
IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO TALK ABOUT

42:06.072 --> 42:09.172
IT BETTER.

42:09.239 --> 42:12.273
>> Bill: THAT CAME UP IN THE

42:12.339 --> 42:14.439
JEWISH COMMUNITY BECAUSE THERE'S

42:14.506 --> 42:17.273
A NEW CONGRESSWOMAN, ILHAN OMAR

42:17.339 --> 42:19.039
WHO IS MUSLIM, ONE OF THE FIRST

42:19.106 --> 42:22.406
WE HAVE IN CONGRESS AND SHE'S

42:22.473 --> 42:23.473
APOLOGIZE, UNDER A LOT OF FIRE

42:23.539 --> 42:25.039
BECAUSE SHE TALKED ABOUT THE

42:25.072 --> 42:25.640
JEWISH LOBBY AIPAC AND SHE SAID

42:25.706 --> 42:28.406
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMIN'S.

42:28.473 --> 42:29.806
I DON'T AGREE WITH HER A LOT

42:29.873 --> 42:31.840
ABOUT HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT ISRAEL

42:31.906 --> 42:34.039
AND PALESTINE, I DON'T KNOW WHY

42:34.106 --> 42:36.239
THIS HAS TO BE SEEN AS

42:36.306 --> 42:37.606
ANTI-SEMITIC.

42:37.673 --> 42:39.406
NOW SHE MIGHT BE ANTI-SEMITIC

42:39.473 --> 42:40.906
BUT IF I CRITICIZE SAUDI ARABIA,

42:40.972 --> 42:42.539
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M IN

42:42.606 --> 42:43.806
ISLAMOPHOBIC.

42:43.873 --> 42:44.706
>> IT DEFENDS HOW.

42:44.773 --> 42:47.406
THERE ARE THINGS YOU COULD SAY

42:47.473 --> 42:49.172
ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA THAT WOULD

42:49.239 --> 42:50.339
MAKE PEOPLE RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS

42:50.406 --> 42:52.439
A LITTLE BIT.

42:52.506 --> 42:54.406
IF YOU SAY IN ITS OPPRESSIVE

42:54.473 --> 42:55.039
OLIGARCHIC MACHINE THAT PLUNDERS

42:55.106 --> 42:55.873
ITS PEOPLE YOU'RE SAYING AN

42:55.939 --> 42:57.806
ACTUAL THING.

42:57.873 --> 42:58.439
THERE ARE JOKES AND REMARKS YOU

42:58.506 --> 43:01.006
COULD MAKE, THINGS YOU COULD SAY

43:01.072 --> 43:02.740
THAT WOULD BE DEMEANING OR

43:02.806 --> 43:06.706
SLIGHTING -- I HAVE TO SAY ONE

43:06.773 --> 43:09.139
OF THE THINGS THAT MAYBE

43:09.206 --> 43:11.439
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR GOT LUCKY

43:11.473 --> 43:12.139
WITH, BY STARTING THIS

43:12.206 --> 43:13.373
CONTROVERSY WE ARE NOT PAYING

43:13.439 --> 43:14.939
ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT SHE

43:15.006 --> 43:20.539
WAS DEFENDING THE CORRUPT REGIME

43:20.606 --> 43:21.206
OF VENEZUELA AND OPPOSING

43:21.273 --> 43:23.706
AMERICAN ACTION TO TRY TO BRING

43:23.773 --> 43:26.806
A RESOLUTION TO THIS TERRIBLE

43:26.873 --> 43:27.972
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, WHICH HE

43:28.039 --> 43:29.039
WAS ARTICULATING THERE.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.239
ONE OF THE REASON HER PARTY TOOK

43:31.306 --> 43:33.239
SUCH A FIRM LINE AGAINST HER,

43:33.306 --> 43:34.606
SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE REALM OF

43:34.673 --> 43:36.439
AMERICAN POLITICS WHICH YOU

43:36.506 --> 43:38.539
THINK WOULD ENCOURAGE THE RISE

43:38.606 --> 43:40.039
OF A DEMOCRATIC VENEZUELA.

43:40.106 --> 43:40.640
>> Bill: YOUR DESCRIPTION OF

43:40.706 --> 43:45.339
VENEZUELA COULD APPLY TO HAMAS

43:45.406 --> 43:48.606
IN GAZA.

43:48.673 --> 43:50.339
>> WE CARRY AROUND WITH US A

43:50.406 --> 43:52.206
MENTAL MAP FORMED IN A DIFFERENT

43:52.273 --> 43:54.840
TIME AND WE USE TERMS OF LEFT

43:54.906 --> 43:56.806
AND RIGHT THAT DON'T APPLY.

43:56.906 --> 43:58.473
THERE ARE GANGSTER GOVERNMENTS

43:58.573 --> 44:00.606
AND SOMETIMES IN VENEZUELA THAT

44:00.673 --> 44:02.972
USE LANGUAGE WITH RESONATES WITH

44:03.039 --> 44:04.673
PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES IN RUSSIA

44:04.740 --> 44:06.239
THEY USE LANGUAGE THAT RESONATES

44:06.306 --> 44:07.473
WITH CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE, THEY

44:07.539 --> 44:08.706
ARE THE SAME.

44:08.773 --> 44:10.673
THE WORLD ORDER IS AN INCREASING

44:10.740 --> 44:11.139
ONE OF GANGSTER VERSUS

44:11.206 --> 44:14.806
NONGANGSTER GOVERNMENTS, THOSE

44:14.873 --> 44:19.406
GOVERNMENTS HAVE A LOT MORE IN

44:19.473 --> 44:22.439
COMMON DESPITE ANY LANGUAGE THAT

44:22.506 --> 44:27.306
IS USED -- I AM POOR PEOPLE, I

44:27.373 --> 44:30.873
HAVE TO FEEL THAT THINGS SOUND

44:30.939 --> 44:33.172
LIKE THEY RESONATE WITH ME, I

44:33.239 --> 44:36.239
HAVE TO OVERLOOK MASSIVE

44:36.306 --> 44:36.906
STEALING AND VIOLENCE IN ALL

44:36.972 --> 44:41.873
DEATH SQUADS ARE IN VENEZUELA,

44:41.972 --> 44:42.439
DON'T BE CONNED.

44:42.506 --> 44:44.039
>> WE SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR HUMAN

44:44.106 --> 44:46.106
RIGHTS FOR PALESTINIANS.

44:46.172 --> 44:49.706
I THINK FOR TOO LONG, IT'S BEEN

44:49.773 --> 44:50.506
OUT-OF-BOUNDS FOR PROGRESSIVES

44:50.573 --> 44:53.273
TO SPEAK UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF

44:53.339 --> 44:55.106
PALESTINIANS.

44:55.172 --> 44:56.139
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT VENEZUELA SO

44:56.206 --> 44:59.873
I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

44:59.939 --> 45:00.740
IT IS A PROGRESSIVE POINT OF

45:00.806 --> 45:05.106
VIEW TO SPEAK UP.

45:05.172 --> 45:07.972
>> THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT

45:08.039 --> 45:10.506
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PROGRESSIVE

45:10.573 --> 45:10.773
POLITICS.

45:10.840 --> 45:11.906
>> IT'S THE THINGS THAT GET

45:11.972 --> 45:13.106
TALKED ABOUT IN AMERICAN MEDIA,

45:13.172 --> 45:15.039
I JUST HAVEN'T READ THAT MUCH

45:15.106 --> 45:16.172
ABOUT VENEZUELA.

45:16.239 --> 45:17.606
ISRAEL AND PALESTINE HAD BEEN

45:17.673 --> 45:19.806
TALKED ABOUT FOR DECADES IN THIS

45:19.873 --> 45:20.039
COUNTRY.

45:20.106 --> 45:21.706
>> Bill: I WISH WE HAD MORE

45:21.773 --> 45:22.906
TIME FOR THIS ONE.

45:22.972 --> 45:24.006
BUT WE DON'T.

45:24.072 --> 45:27.873
IT'S TIME FOR NEW RULES,

45:27.939 --> 45:30.106
EVERYBODY.

45:30.640 --> 45:31.773
NEW RULE: JUST BECAUSE URBAN

45:31.840 --> 45:32.273
OUTFITTERS SUGGESTS THIS

45:32.339 --> 45:36.206
VIBRATOR AS A VALENTINE'S DAY

45:36.273 --> 45:37.139
GIFT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BUY

45:37.206 --> 45:38.039
IT AS A VALENTINE'S DAY GIFT.

45:38.106 --> 45:39.039
WHAT COULD BE MORE ROMANTIC

45:39.106 --> 45:40.072
THAN, "HERE YOU GO, HON, KNOCK

45:40.139 --> 45:41.273
YOURSELF OUT.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.740
I'LL BE IN THE BASEMENT PLAYING

45:43.806 --> 45:47.939
FORTNITE."

45:49.306 --> 45:50.606
NEW RULE: NOW THAT 21 SAVAGE IS

45:50.673 --> 45:51.339
OUT OF IMMIGRATION JAIL AND

45:51.406 --> 45:52.840
READY TO, AS HIS LAWYERS PUT IT,

45:52.906 --> 45:53.539
"CONTINUE MAKING MUSIC THAT

45:53.606 --> 45:54.506
BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER."

45:54.573 --> 45:55.806
THEY MUST TELL US WHICH OF HIS

45:55.873 --> 45:56.373
SONGS ARE BEST AT BRINGING

45:56.439 --> 45:57.373
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

45:57.439 --> 45:58.473
IS IT THE ONE THAT GOES: "I GOT

45:58.539 --> 45:59.706
MODEL BITCHES WANT TO LICK ME

45:59.773 --> 46:01.006
LIKE SOME CANDY.

46:01.072 --> 46:02.806
AND THEM DRUGS COME IN HANDY.

46:02.873 --> 46:04.139
HIT HER WITH NO CONDOM, HAD TO

46:04.206 --> 46:07.673
MAKE HER EAT A PLAN B."

46:08.006 --> 46:08.606
OR IS IT THE ONE THAT GOES:

46:08.673 --> 46:09.373
"FUCK HER IN MY ROLLIE.

46:09.439 --> 46:10.139
FUCK HER IN MY ROLLIE.

46:10.206 --> 46:11.139
I'MA FUCK HER IN MY ROLLIE.

46:11.206 --> 46:11.939
FUCK HER IN A ROVER.

46:12.006 --> 46:12.873
FUCK HER IN A ROVER.

46:12.939 --> 46:13.873
I'MA FUCK HER IN A ROVER.

46:13.939 --> 46:14.673
BEND THE BITCH OVER, BEND THE

46:14.740 --> 46:15.506
BITCH OVER.

46:15.573 --> 46:16.706
I'MA BEND THE BITCH OVER.

46:16.773 --> 46:17.339
FUCK HER ON A SOFA, FUCK HER ON

46:17.406 --> 46:18.439
A SOFA.

46:18.506 --> 46:28.039
I'MA FUCK HER ON THE SOFA."

46:28.573 --> 46:33.139
YOUR MOVE, #MeToo.

46:35.673 --> 46:36.539
NEW RULE: WHOEVER IN THE WHITE

46:36.606 --> 46:37.606
HOUSE INVENTED THE TERM

46:37.673 --> 46:38.640
"EXECUTIVE TIME" TO DESCRIBE

46:38.706 --> 46:39.873
WATCHING TV AND TWEETING ON THE

46:39.939 --> 46:40.806
TOILET DESERVES A RAISE.

46:40.873 --> 46:42.273
AND THEN THEY SHOULD USE IT IN A

46:42.339 --> 46:43.706
TV AD: YOU'VE WORKED HARD FOR

46:43.773 --> 46:44.906
FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TALKING TO

46:44.972 --> 46:46.239
PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT

46:46.306 --> 46:47.673
THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

46:47.740 --> 46:50.806
NOW IT'S EXECUTIVE TIME.

46:50.873 --> 46:53.072
JUST YOU, THE TV, AND A BIG BOWL

46:53.139 --> 46:55.773
OF BREYER'S VANILLA FUDGE TWIRL.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.406
EXECUTIVE TIME: BECAUSE WEARING

46:57.473 --> 47:03.406
PANTS IS FOR LOSERS.

47:10.406 --> 47:11.139
NEW RULE: FASHION CRITICS MUST

47:11.206 --> 47:11.873
GIVE MR. CLEAN HIS PROPS AS A

47:11.939 --> 47:12.873
TRENDSETTER.

47:12.939 --> 47:19.773
HE WAS ROCKING THE SHAVED HEAD

47:19.840 --> 47:20.473
LONG BEFORE JEFF BEZOS OR THE

47:20.539 --> 47:21.206
ROCK.

47:21.273 --> 47:22.640
MR. CLEAN WAS WAY AHEAD OF HIS

47:22.706 --> 47:24.506
TIME: THE EARRING, THE SELFIE

47:24.573 --> 47:25.673
SMIRK, THE ON-AGAIN OFF- AGAIN

47:25.740 --> 47:27.473
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRAWNY

47:27.539 --> 47:32.606
PAPER TOWEL GUY.

47:37.673 --> 47:38.406
NEW RULE: IDIOTS HAVE TO STOP

47:38.473 --> 47:39.506
POSTING THIS FAKE QUOTE FROM

47:39.573 --> 47:40.606
KURT COBAIN WHERE HE PREDICTS

47:40.673 --> 47:41.673
THE ELECTION OF "A TRUE

47:41.740 --> 47:42.873
OUTSIDER.

47:42.939 --> 47:43.873
WHO DOES WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE

47:43.939 --> 47:45.373
PEOPLE.

47:45.439 --> 47:46.806
DONALD TRUMP."

47:46.873 --> 47:48.239
HE NEVER SAID IT.

47:48.306 --> 47:49.339
HE DID, HOWEVER, PREDICT TRUMP

47:49.406 --> 47:50.606
WITH THIS ALBUM COVER.

47:50.673 --> 47:53.172
A TODDLER WITH A TINY DICK,

47:53.239 --> 48:01.273
CHASING MONEY.

48:04.172 --> 48:05.172
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

48:05.239 --> 48:06.072
NO MORE SWIPING LEFT ON

48:06.139 --> 48:07.072
PERFECTLY GOOD PRESIDENTIAL

48:07.139 --> 48:08.239
CANDIDATES.

48:08.306 --> 48:09.706
NEARLY 45 MILLION AMERICANS NOW

48:09.773 --> 48:12.206
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS

48:12.273 --> 48:13.506
DEMOCRATS, AND ALL OF THEM ARE

48:13.573 --> 48:14.806
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

48:14.873 --> 48:16.139
THIS TIME, LET'S GIVE THEM A

48:16.206 --> 48:18.273
CHANCE.

48:18.339 --> 48:19.606
LET'S NOT EAT OUR OWN, THE WAY

48:19.673 --> 48:21.339
WE NITPICKED HILLARY TO DEATH

48:21.406 --> 48:22.773
OVER HER EMAILS AND OTHER

48:22.840 --> 48:26.773
BULLSHIT.

48:28.806 --> 48:30.873
KAMALA HARRIS HAS ALREADY HAD TO

48:30.939 --> 48:32.439
PLAY DEFENSE BECAUSE IT'S COME

48:32.506 --> 48:33.539
OUT WHEN SHE WAS A PROSECUTOR

48:33.606 --> 48:36.573
SHE PROSECUTED PEOPLE.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.840
NOT VERY PROGRESSIVE.

48:38.906 --> 48:40.473
SHE SHOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO

48:40.539 --> 48:41.673
APPLY MORE FORGIVENESS, AND THE

48:41.740 --> 48:42.939
FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T IS

48:43.006 --> 48:47.439
UNFORGIVABLE.

48:48.873 --> 48:51.740
ELIZABETH WARREN CLAIMED TO BE

48:51.806 --> 48:52.806
NATIVE AMERICAN -- SO WHAT,

48:52.873 --> 49:01.172
TRUMP CLAIMED TO BE HUMAN.

49:01.773 --> 49:02.806
IF YOU THINK THIS STUPID,

49:02.873 --> 49:03.972
BLOWN-OUT-OF PROPORTION INDIAN

49:04.039 --> 49:05.139
CONTROVERSY MAKES HER

49:05.206 --> 49:06.873
"INAUTHENTIC," YOU'RE THE PHONY.

49:06.939 --> 49:08.273
SHE IS THE CHAMPION OF CONSUMER

49:08.339 --> 49:11.306
RIGHTS IN THE AGE OF INCOME

49:11.373 --> 49:12.473
INEQUALITY, ABOUT ELIZABETH

49:12.539 --> 49:19.072
WARREN I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS.

49:21.206 --> 49:23.239
BERNIE SANDERS?

49:23.306 --> 49:24.306
WE USED TO LIKE HIM, BUT HE

49:24.373 --> 49:26.172
DIDN'T PERSONALLY CHAPERONE

49:26.239 --> 49:27.172
EVERYONE ON HIS CAMPAIGN IN

49:27.239 --> 49:28.473
2016, SO HE'S A SEX MONSTER ONCE

49:28.539 --> 49:30.439
REMOVED.

49:30.506 --> 49:31.972
A CANDIDATE HAS GOT TO HAVE

49:32.039 --> 49:33.606
TOUGH STANDARDS FOR THEIR STAFF.

49:33.673 --> 49:34.439
BUT NOT TOO TOUGH, THAT'S AMY

49:34.506 --> 49:36.539
KLOBUCHAR.

49:36.606 --> 49:37.939
LAST WEEK WE LEARNED SHE'S

49:38.006 --> 49:39.773
VERBALLY ABUSIVE.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.172
THEN AGAIN, THIS CAME FROM THE

49:41.239 --> 49:44.072
HUFFINGTON POST, SO I GOTTA ASK:

49:44.139 --> 49:45.773
DO YOU MEAN ACTUALLY ABUSIVE, OR

49:45.840 --> 49:47.806
WHAT MILLENNIALS THINK IS

49:47.873 --> 49:54.273
ABUSIVE?

49:54.806 --> 49:55.473
CUZ I THINK IT'S LIKE THAT PAIN

49:55.539 --> 49:57.273
CHART AT THE HOSPITAL.

49:57.306 --> 49:58.972
AND I THINK MY GENERATION'S 2 IS

49:59.039 --> 50:07.139
YOUR GENERATION'S 10.

50:10.239 --> 50:11.373
SO WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD,

50:11.439 --> 50:12.339
SNOWFLAKE.

50:12.406 --> 50:17.640
NOW GO GET AMY HER COFFEE AND

50:17.706 --> 50:20.306
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

50:20.373 --> 50:22.039
BETO O'ROURKE TOOK OIL MONEY!

50:22.106 --> 50:23.972
YEAH, HE'S IN TEXAS -- ALL THE

50:24.039 --> 50:27.306
MONEY IN TEXAS IS OIL MONEY.

50:27.373 --> 50:28.740
THE ONLY OTHER JOB IS OPERATING

50:28.806 --> 50:32.172
THE MECHANICAL BULL.

50:32.239 --> 50:33.172
IT'S LIKE COMPLAINING MITT

50:33.239 --> 50:35.740
ROMNEY TAKES MONEY FROM MORMONS.

50:35.806 --> 50:37.172
EVERY DEMOCRAT IS GONNA HAVE

50:37.239 --> 50:39.339
SOME DARK SPOT.

50:39.406 --> 50:45.573
IN VIRGINIA, IT'S ON THEIR FACE.

50:48.606 --> 50:49.873
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SONG TRUMP

50:49.939 --> 50:51.873
PLAYS AT HIS RALLIES?

50:51.939 --> 50:52.972
THE STONES "YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET

50:53.039 --> 50:55.106
WHAT YOU WANT."

50:55.172 --> 50:56.706
WHICH SEEMS LIKE AN ODD CHOICE,

50:56.773 --> 50:59.673
BUT IT TELLS YOU WHY REPUBLICANS

50:59.740 --> 51:00.773
ARE SO SUCCESSFUL - BECAUSE

51:00.840 --> 51:02.539
THEY'RE NOT BABIES WHO THINK YOU

51:02.606 --> 51:03.640
CAN HAVE EVERYTHING.

51:03.706 --> 51:04.806
EVANGELICALS DON'T REALLY LIKE

51:04.873 --> 51:06.806
DONALD TRUMP -- THEY KNOW HE

51:06.873 --> 51:07.640
CAN'T EVEN PASS A CHURCH WITHOUT

51:07.706 --> 51:15.972
BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

51:16.306 --> 51:18.139
BUT HE GOT THEM TWO JUSTICES ON

51:18.206 --> 51:20.373
THE SUPREME COURT.

51:20.439 --> 51:22.439
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU

51:22.506 --> 51:23.939
WANT, BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIMES

51:24.006 --> 51:24.939
YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED: THAT'S

51:25.006 --> 51:26.840
THEIR JAM.

51:26.906 --> 51:29.939
OURS IS "THANK YOU, NEXT."

51:30.006 --> 51:30.740
WE GO FROM "I LOVE YOU" TO

51:30.806 --> 51:32.172
"DIE!"

51:32.239 --> 51:33.039
IN ABOUT SIX HOURS - IT'S LIKE

51:33.106 --> 51:38.906
DATING TAYLOR SWIFT.

51:39.239 --> 51:40.640
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE RE-BOOT

51:40.706 --> 51:42.706
OF "TEMPTATION ISLAND," NOT TO

51:42.773 --> 51:44.640
BRAG, AND IT'S STARTLING HOW

51:44.706 --> 51:45.939
SIMILAR THE MENTALITY IS TO

51:46.006 --> 51:47.473
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

51:47.539 --> 51:48.906
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

51:48.972 --> 51:50.172
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR,

51:50.239 --> 51:51.806
"TEMPTATION ISLAND" IS THE SHOW

51:51.873 --> 51:53.273
WHERE HOT PEOPLE DATING HOT

51:53.339 --> 51:55.273
PEOPLE ARE IN SEARCH FOR HOTTER

51:55.339 --> 51:57.106
PEOPLE.

51:57.172 --> 51:58.373
CONTESTANTS ONLY HAVE TWO

51:58.439 --> 52:01.306
EMOTIONS, HORNY AND CRYING, AND

52:01.373 --> 52:04.239
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SHOW IS,

52:04.306 --> 52:06.640
YOU CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.139
EVERY CONTESTANT BEGINS THEIR

52:08.206 --> 52:11.439
"JOURNEY" BY SAYING THE SAME

52:11.506 --> 52:13.172
THING: "I LOVE WHAT I HAVE WITH

52:13.239 --> 52:14.506
TREVIN.

52:14.573 --> 52:15.873
BUT I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMEONE

52:15.939 --> 52:19.106
MORE PERFECT FOR ME."

52:19.172 --> 52:21.573
THERE ISN'T.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.239
THAT NEW ASSHOLE IN THE TANK TOP

52:23.306 --> 52:24.673
IS THE SAME AS YOUR ASSHOLE IN

52:24.740 --> 52:30.706
THE TANK TOP.

52:31.406 --> 52:32.773
THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM IN OUR

52:32.840 --> 52:35.373
SOCIETY - LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE

52:35.439 --> 52:36.573
TO DUMP SOMEONE GOOD BECAUSE

52:36.640 --> 52:39.139
THERE MUST BE ONE MORE PERFECT.

52:39.206 --> 52:40.873
AND SOMETIMES WHAT YOU WIND UP

52:40.939 --> 52:42.106
WITH IS NO ONE TO HOST THE

52:42.172 --> 52:48.006
OSCARS AT ALL.

52:51.206 --> 52:51.906
YEAH LOOK AT THE OSCARS --

52:51.972 --> 52:53.039
THEY'RE BEING RUINED BY THESE

52:53.106 --> 52:54.206
SAME KIND OF RIDICULOUS PURITY

52:54.273 --> 52:55.706
TESTS.

52:55.773 --> 52:57.773
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY IS FLAWED

52:57.840 --> 52:58.906
BECAUSE IT'S GAY, BUT NOT GAY

52:58.972 --> 53:00.806
ENOUGH.

53:00.873 --> 53:02.139
REALLY - THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

53:02.206 --> 53:03.339
SAYING: IT'S INSENSITIVE TO THE

53:03.406 --> 53:07.673
EXTREMELY GAY.

53:07.740 --> 53:10.573
FOR YEARS, THE BEEF ABOUT GAY

53:10.640 --> 53:12.373
CHARACTERS IN MOVIES WAS THEY

53:12.439 --> 53:15.006
WERE REDUCED TO THEIR SEXUALITY

53:15.072 --> 53:16.306
-- NOW THE SEXUALITY IS PLACED

53:16.373 --> 53:17.706
IN THE BACKGROUND AND IT'S,

53:17.773 --> 53:24.439
"WHERE'S THE DICK SUCKING?!"

53:26.706 --> 53:27.972
ROMA DELIVERS SUCH AN AUTHENTIC

53:28.039 --> 53:34.573
PORTRAIT OF A MEXICAN

53:34.640 --> 53:35.972
HOUSEKEEPER, ARNOLD

53:36.039 --> 53:37.406
SCHWARZENEGGER TRIED TO

53:37.473 --> 53:40.539
IMPREGNATE IT.

53:41.373 --> 53:42.873
BUT IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT THE POOR,
