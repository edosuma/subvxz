WEBVTT

00:06.832 --> 00:08.874
Wow, my backpack sure is heavy today!

00:08.957 --> 00:10.249
What do you got in there?

00:10.332 --> 00:11.665
[scoffs] Osmium?

00:11.749 --> 00:13.415
Y'know, the densest element?

00:13.498 --> 00:16.124
Periodic table. Boom!

00:16.207 --> 00:17.832
Actually, it's a doctor's note.

00:20.041 --> 00:22.749
The school lets me turn them in
in bulk at the end of the month,

00:22.832 --> 00:25.124
that way the doctor only has
to sign the signature page,

00:25.207 --> 00:27.665
instead of all the individual excuses.

00:27.749 --> 00:29.582
Melissa keeps a record
of all my adventures.

00:29.665 --> 00:30.915
So it makes it easier to catalog.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.041
You keep a record?

00:32.124 --> 00:33.249
Yeah, on my phone.

00:33.332 --> 00:35.373
The kangaroos,
the tangerine fight at Mardi Gras,

00:35.457 --> 00:36.415
the asteroid...

00:36.498 --> 00:37.832
The llama incident...

00:37.915 --> 00:41.166
Wait, so you've been taking
pictures this... Holy cow!

00:41.249 --> 00:43.041
Yep, Milo gets around.

00:43.124 --> 00:44.915
How long is your selfie-stick?

00:44.999 --> 00:47.915
Anyway, I gotta turn
these bad boys in today,

00:47.999 --> 00:50.749
or else I have a month of
unexcused absences and...

00:50.832 --> 00:52.582
Stop! Milo.

00:52.665 --> 00:53.874
Hi, Elliot!

00:53.957 --> 00:55.957
How do you stop people
who aren't named Milo?

00:56.041 --> 00:57.415
I don't turn the sign around.

00:57.498 --> 01:00.082
[all] Oh!

01:00.166 --> 01:02.957
Besides, there's only one person
in this town I need to stop.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.957
And his middle name is danger.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.665
-Is that true?
-[scoffs]

01:06.749 --> 01:08.832
No. It's pronounced,
[in French accent] "Danger."

01:08.915 --> 01:10.623
It's my grandmother's maiden name...

01:10.707 --> 01:12.291
Enough! You have to do as I say!

01:12.373 --> 01:15.665
And, as the duly appointed Public
Safety Czar, it is my job...

01:15.749 --> 01:18.082
Um, your badge says,
"Volunteer Crossing Guard."

01:18.166 --> 01:20.957
And this one says, "Ask me about
my Strawberry Waffle Supreme."

01:21.041 --> 01:23.166
They're quite tasty and
they're half price this week!

01:23.249 --> 01:25.957
Well, as delicious as that sounds, Elliot,

01:26.041 --> 01:26.957
we have to go to school.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.874
I have my eye on you, Murphy.

01:28.957 --> 01:29.957
And I never rest.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.166
In fact, I sleep with this stop sign.

01:32.249 --> 01:34.415
If you never rest, how do you sleep?

01:34.498 --> 01:35.999
Very restlessly!

01:36.082 --> 01:37.915
-[all] Oh!
-[horn blaring]

01:42.790 --> 01:44.665
[screaming]

01:44.749 --> 01:46.665
Ahhh!

01:46.749 --> 01:48.915
There's a water bug on the back of this!

01:48.999 --> 01:52.999
Without that signature page,
you'll have a month of unexcused absences!

01:53.082 --> 01:55.332
Holy cow. I'm gonna have to
repeat the seventh grade!

01:55.415 --> 01:56.665
Don't worry, Milo!

01:56.749 --> 01:58.124
We'll help you find that note!

01:58.207 --> 02:00.332
But how? This is ridiculous,
I mean that note could be...

02:00.415 --> 02:01.999
Oh, there it is. I'll get it.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.291
Murphy's Law. Boom.

02:05.373 --> 02:07.041
Are you gonna be saying that a lot?

02:07.124 --> 02:07.999
I'm thinking about it.

02:08.082 --> 02:09.124
After that note!

02:09.207 --> 02:11.041
I'm watching you, Milo!

02:12.207 --> 02:14.166
So, strawberry waffles?

02:14.249 --> 02:16.957
[sighs] They're quite tasty
and half price this week...

02:17.041 --> 02:18.874
[Milo] Hey, biker gang! Come back!

02:18.957 --> 02:20.540
[Melissa]I don't think
you'd call them a gang.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.207
[Milo] What's a group of biker's
then, a gaggle?

02:22.291 --> 02:23.332
[Zack] I think it's a pod.

02:23.415 --> 02:24.707
[Melissa] No, that's whales.

02:24.790 --> 02:27.623
Oh, there it is! I got it!
I got it! What the...

02:27.707 --> 02:29.041
What was that?

02:29.124 --> 02:31.498
It looks like some
kind of spy drone.

02:31.582 --> 02:33.874
What the devil,
is that a doctor's note?

02:33.957 --> 02:36.498
Lieutenant, did you take a short
cut through the Murphy Sector?

02:36.582 --> 02:38.166
I'm sorry, sir.

02:38.249 --> 02:40.874
I just wanted to see if my brother-in-law
was using my lawn mower again.

02:40.957 --> 02:42.166
Well? Was he?

02:42.249 --> 02:43.790
Yeah, I got a shot of it.

02:43.874 --> 02:45.749
Oh, that makes me so mad!

02:50.957 --> 02:54.041
[Milo] Oh, great,
I'm covered in garbage again!

03:00.082 --> 03:04.082
Milo, wouldn't it be easier just to
get your doctor to sign a new one?

03:04.166 --> 03:06.665
It's Tuesday.
He's playing golf somewhere.

03:06.749 --> 03:08.041
We'd never find him!

03:09.832 --> 03:11.582
Excuse me, you're not a
doctor, are you?

03:11.665 --> 03:12.749
No.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.749
One, two, three, four, five...

03:15.832 --> 03:17.082
It's on the seventh floor.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.207
Come on!

03:20.874 --> 03:22.166
[all panting]

03:28.207 --> 03:29.999
Oh, no, there's paper everywhere!

03:30.082 --> 03:31.582
I guess they haven't gone digital yet.

03:31.665 --> 03:33.207
My note could be anywhere.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.999
We'll find it! Come on, let's split up!

03:40.041 --> 03:41.041
[grunts]

03:49.415 --> 03:51.041
Excuse me, ma'am?

03:51.124 --> 03:53.291
But would you mind lifting
up your coffee cup, please?

03:53.373 --> 03:55.124
Thank you.

03:55.207 --> 03:57.957
Oh, my gosh, this coffee
stain is a perfect likeness

03:58.041 --> 04:00.498
of Frank Eugene Austin,
inventor of the ant farm.

04:00.582 --> 04:01.999
It's a miracle!

04:02.082 --> 04:04.041
I bet it has healing powers.

04:04.124 --> 04:05.291
[woman] Oh, I want to see it!

04:05.373 --> 04:07.124
[clamoring]

04:07.207 --> 04:09.207
That's my doctor's note.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.415
[fan whirring]

04:12.249 --> 04:13.332
Seriously?

04:13.415 --> 04:15.249
What? It was getting stuffy in here.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.166
I don't believe it.

04:18.249 --> 04:19.582
It's a ticker tape parade.

04:19.665 --> 04:22.041
You sure you can't get your
doctor to sign a new note?

04:22.124 --> 04:24.415
I told you. There's no way to find him.

04:26.373 --> 04:28.207
Are you a doctor?

04:28.291 --> 04:29.124
No.

04:31.457 --> 04:32.915
That's it, it's over.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.166
No, it's not over!

04:34.249 --> 04:36.166
When we signed up
to be Milo's friend,

04:36.249 --> 04:37.915
we knew it wouldn't be easy.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.291
I don't remember
signing anything.

04:39.373 --> 04:41.291
So are we going
to find that note?

04:41.373 --> 04:42.540
That's a good question.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.082
You're supposed to say, "Yes," Milo.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.166
Well then. Yes!

04:45.249 --> 04:46.999
That's the spirit!

04:47.082 --> 04:48.540
[man] You doin' all right up there, sir?

04:48.623 --> 04:49.999
Aw, I'm doing great!

04:50.082 --> 04:51.665
You know what? I'd love a hamburger.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.207
They don't have hamburgers in space.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.207
The parade must be for that astronaut.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.207
Oh, it's not for the astronaut.

04:57.291 --> 05:00.498
This parade is celebrating the 150th
anniversary of ticker tape parades.

05:00.582 --> 05:02.207
Then what's the astronaut for?

05:02.291 --> 05:04.207
They're just giving him a ride somewhere.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.874
Very slowly,
because he likes to sit up there.

05:06.957 --> 05:09.124
[gasps] The astronaut's back!

05:09.207 --> 05:11.540
Yes, I know he's back!
We all just saw him.

05:11.623 --> 05:12.874
-No, I mean the...
-[Diogee barking]

05:12.957 --> 05:14.415
[sniffs and barks]

05:14.498 --> 05:16.207
Excuse me for a second, Zack.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.749
-What is it, boy?
-[barks]

05:18.665 --> 05:19.874
Hey, everybody!

05:19.957 --> 05:21.249
Diogee found the note.

05:21.332 --> 05:23.207
It's on the astronaut's back!

05:23.291 --> 05:24.915
Eh. Fine.

05:24.999 --> 05:27.373
Hey! Mr. Astronaut! Hey!

05:27.457 --> 05:31.041
Hey! Can you hear me?
Hey! Can you hear me?

05:31.124 --> 05:32.498
Hey! Hey!

05:32.582 --> 05:35.082
Can you hear me? Hey!
Can you hear me?

05:35.166 --> 05:38.332
-Larry! Open the door!
-[pop music playing]

05:38.415 --> 05:40.540
I'm running out of air out here!

05:40.623 --> 05:45.249
I never should have given
him those headphones!

05:45.332 --> 05:47.415
[Colonel Niblet] Uh-oh.
Wilson is losing it.

05:47.498 --> 05:50.166
We can't have him freaking out
in front of all those people!

05:50.249 --> 05:52.249
Use the Disintegration Ray!

05:52.332 --> 05:54.124
[powering up]

05:54.207 --> 05:56.249
Uh, sir? We could just
drive him out of the parade.

05:56.332 --> 05:57.999
He'll be fine once he gets his hamburger.

05:58.082 --> 05:59.124
You're right, Lieutenant.

05:59.207 --> 06:01.291
Ugh! And to think of all
the parade astronauts

06:01.373 --> 06:03.291
that I've unnecessarily disintegrated.

06:03.373 --> 06:04.623
Stand down, soldier.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.332
Aw!

06:08.166 --> 06:09.249
Don't worry, sir.

06:09.332 --> 06:10.540
We'll get you that hamburger soon.

06:10.623 --> 06:12.832
Awesome. 'Cause they don't
have hamburgers in space.

06:15.373 --> 06:16.373
There!

06:18.623 --> 06:20.623
I got it, I got it, I got it!

06:20.707 --> 06:22.249
Milo! Look out!

06:23.332 --> 06:24.373
Oh, well.

06:24.457 --> 06:26.373
Have fun in high school, guys.

06:26.457 --> 06:29.582
No. You know the middle school code.
No one gets left behind.

06:29.665 --> 06:30.665
Boom!

06:30.749 --> 06:32.832
That's right. I'm going after it.

06:35.373 --> 06:37.999
Wow, that's going a lot
slower than I thought.

06:38.082 --> 06:40.498
After that slow-moving street sweeper!

06:48.041 --> 06:49.623
Okay, could be worse.

06:49.707 --> 06:51.166
How? How could this be worse?

06:51.249 --> 06:53.291
Eh, you could accidentally
get your head caught

06:53.373 --> 06:55.957
in a helicopter door that
flies you out of the ocean

06:56.041 --> 06:58.582
where it drops you straight
into a pod of ravenous orca

06:58.665 --> 07:01.041
that rip you apart leaving
nothing but your bones

07:01.124 --> 07:04.999
for the hungry crabs in the inky
depths at the bottom of the ocean.

07:05.082 --> 07:06.999
Wow. I mean...

07:07.082 --> 07:09.623
Yeah, I'm...
I'm not sure how to respond to that.

That's great!

08:09.623 --> 08:10.957
My foot is stuck!

08:14.291 --> 08:16.749
And I'm about to be
shredded and recycled.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.249
Oh, no. That's not great.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.207
The being shredded part,
not the recycling part.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.124
Because recycling is an important way
to...

08:22.207 --> 08:23.041
[Melissa] Milo!

08:23.124 --> 08:24.498
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry! On my way!

08:25.832 --> 08:26.957
Here I come, Melissa!

08:28.457 --> 08:29.373
Don't worry I'm...

08:29.457 --> 08:31.166
Ahhh!

08:31.249 --> 08:33.082
I'll get there. Don't worry!

08:33.166 --> 08:34.207
I'm worrying.

08:36.540 --> 08:38.415
You know, I bet that whole
thing with the helicopter

08:38.498 --> 08:40.540
and the orcas is looking
pretty good right now.

08:48.498 --> 08:50.457
Okay, that was kinda awesome.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.166
Doctor's note. Boom.

08:52.249 --> 08:53.415
Melissa, you've got the note!

08:53.498 --> 08:54.457
"Please excuse

08:54.540 --> 08:56.707
"Lola Sundergard"?

08:56.790 --> 08:58.249
This isn't my note!

08:58.332 --> 09:00.082
Who is Lola Sundergard?

09:00.166 --> 09:02.249
Oh, great!
You found my doctor's note!

09:02.332 --> 09:03.415
Thanks!

09:03.498 --> 09:04.915
Bam!

09:04.999 --> 09:07.249
Well, I... I guess we're gonna be going.

09:07.332 --> 09:08.790
Yeah, us too, uh...

09:09.415 --> 09:10.749
-Bye!
-Bye!

09:10.832 --> 09:11.832
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:12.707 --> 09:14.332
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:14.415 --> 09:15.373
-[barks]
-[oinks]

09:16.665 --> 09:18.582
Diogee! Where did you get this?

09:18.665 --> 09:20.582
Hey! It's your doctor's note!

09:20.665 --> 09:23.457
Life has a strange
way of working out.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.749
Good boy, Diogee.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.373
Well, we have plenty of time
to turn in these doctor's...

09:27.457 --> 09:29.041
Stop!

09:29.124 --> 09:31.457
Hang on a second, this was...
This was just working.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.957
We're just trying to get to school.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.498
Why can't you leave us alone?

09:34.582 --> 09:37.457
Because Milo is a danger to this town,

09:37.540 --> 09:39.749
and I'm going to protect it from him.

09:39.832 --> 09:41.291
I'm like the wind.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.373
I'm everywhere and nowhere.

09:43.457 --> 09:47.207
You're never going to see me...

09:47.291 --> 09:48.457
Okay, wow.

09:48.540 --> 09:49.582
That was impressive.

09:49.665 --> 09:52.915
Yeah, I don't know how you did
that, Elliot,

09:52.999 --> 09:55.498
but we're going to go to school now.

09:55.582 --> 09:57.874
So, see you tomorrow. Okay?

09:57.957 --> 09:59.415
Sorry, sir. I... I thought...

09:59.498 --> 10:02.498
Ugh. Please tell me we
have a re-integration ray?

10:02.582 --> 10:04.457
Yes, sir. I just flip this switch, sir.

10:05.957 --> 10:07.957
Wait a minute, what just happened?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.249
Last thing I remembered,
I was in a parade.

10:12.249 --> 10:13.957
Listen, I have a confession to make.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.332
Yeah, what?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.332
I am a doctor.

10:17.415 --> 10:19.415
You... Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

10:19.498 --> 10:22.498
II wanted you to like me for who I am.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.124
