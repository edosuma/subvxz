00:26.113 --> 00:27.940
Everyone who loves board games

00:27.984 --> 00:34.860
knows that they are as numerous and diverse as life itself.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.254
Games of chance,

00:37.298 --> 00:41.693
ingenuity, strategy.

00:41.737 --> 00:45.262
Games that can be played
alone, with a partner,

00:45.306 --> 00:47.177
or in a group.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.875
Some invented hundreds
of years ago

00:49.919 --> 00:53.879
and others only recently.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.620
But when board game enthusiasts

00:55.664 --> 00:57.796
are asked to choose
an adventurous,

00:57.840 --> 01:01.931
fantastic and thrilling game

01:01.974 --> 01:06.936
the life of Ivan Drago
comes out on top.

01:09.939 --> 01:12.724
Where did the game
come from?

01:12.768 --> 01:18.295
Was it the brain-child
of a great inventor?

01:18.339 --> 01:22.082
How it came to be
is a great story,

01:22.125 --> 01:25.215
and one of the squares
at the beginning,

01:25.259 --> 01:28.218
the one that shows
a ferris wheel,

01:28.262 --> 01:31.003
is a good place to start.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.138
Come on, Ivan.

01:35.182 --> 01:38.750
We'll be able to see the whole
town from the top.

01:38.794 --> 01:42.624
It was Ivan Drago's
10th birthday.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.105
His parents had brought him
to the fairground

01:45.148 --> 01:49.413
thinking there could be no
finer present for their son.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.241
[laughter]

01:51.285 --> 01:52.286
Thank you.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.678
Don't be afraid.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.115
You know, your old man
used to fly real balloons.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.855
How about that?

01:56.899 --> 01:58.596
Terrific.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.599
Say Joey, keep us spinning
will ya?

02:01.643 --> 02:03.993
Here come the Drago's!

02:04.036 --> 02:05.647
Aw, take that you--

02:05.690 --> 02:07.953
Oh you did it,
oh my goodness!

02:07.997 --> 02:10.086
Nice to meet ya.

02:11.566 --> 02:12.523
It's embarrassing.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.003
Let's try the carousel.

02:14.046 --> 02:17.963
He's too old for the carousel.

02:18.007 --> 02:21.619
Alright son, you know what,
lets get you home.

02:21.663 --> 02:24.448
If we hurry we might catch the
beginning of Emma's wrestling.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.537
Then something happened

02:26.581 --> 02:30.150
that would change Ivan's
life forever.

02:30.193 --> 02:34.023
Are those the prizes?

02:34.066 --> 02:35.285
Yes.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.808
Hit the apples
and you take home

02:36.852 --> 02:41.987
this rare old backgammon set.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.686
Ivan, you know our family
doesn't play games.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.817
Oh come on, just this once.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.079
It's his special day, look.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.603
Look.

02:49.734 --> 02:50.605
Never mind.

02:50.648 --> 02:53.173
Two direct hits get you dominos.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.000
Oh.

02:55.044 --> 02:59.309
One apple gets you
this checkers... set.

02:59.353 --> 03:03.183
But the stall attendant was
unusually generous this day.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.273
Hey, don't forget
your consolation prize.

03:08.753 --> 03:12.627
For Ivan, this was as good as any prize he could have won.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.547
Ivan!

03:19.590 --> 03:21.723
You're going to miss
the last round!

03:23.768 --> 03:27.250
Invent a game
and send it today.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.862
Ivan, come on!

03:30.906 --> 03:33.561
Roll the dice and draw
a dream in each square.

03:33.604 --> 03:36.781
Each player has one minute
to draw his dream.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.870
Only one dream can be drawn
in each turn,

03:38.914 --> 03:41.046
the player who fills in the most squares is the winner.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.570
[car horn]

03:44.267 --> 03:45.137
Ivan?

03:45.181 --> 03:47.227
Wake up, it's late.

03:56.192 --> 03:59.064
With every roll of the dice
you have to draw something

03:59.108 --> 04:00.588
in the appropriate square.

04:00.631 --> 04:03.547
Like an airplane if they want
to travel, or the moon.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.549
Hi mom.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.943
Ivan, do you want cheesecake
or chocolate?

04:07.986 --> 04:10.162
Chocolate.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.078
And if they can't think of
anything they don't draw.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.385
What are you doing?

04:15.429 --> 04:17.866
I'm entering a competition.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.476
Ivan, it's an old comic.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.436
The competition is probably
over by now.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.009
Does it have a name?

04:31.053 --> 04:34.274
It's called what do you want
to be when you grow up.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.406
Mrs. Drago helped him.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.192
Not with the games themselves...

04:40.236 --> 04:43.587
But by hiding Ivan's activities from his father.

04:43.631 --> 04:48.331
As Mr. Drago had a strict
no games policy in their home.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.854
Remember Aldis,
you know, Aldis.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.813
Shared an office together
when I started at the bank

04:51.856 --> 04:53.597
well I ran into him
at lunch today.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.426
He told me his son little Aldis
is taking up rugby.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.862
He offered to take
Ivan around

04:57.906 --> 04:58.950
the club next Saturday.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.126
That doesn't make sense.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.433
A player can't steal
other players dreams.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.088
If they do they lose.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.141
Napoleon, ocean liner
Napoleon.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.665
Ocean liner.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.493
Third on the right.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.201
[loud horn]

05:41.079 --> 05:42.472
Ivan?

05:42.516 --> 05:43.734
Ivan, wake up.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.606
There's a letter for you.

05:50.262 --> 05:53.831
Dear Ivan, we are delighted
to inform you that your game

05:53.875 --> 05:58.009
has placed you amongst
the top ten thousand entrants

05:58.053 --> 05:59.489
in our competition.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.186
In recognition of this
achievement please find enclosed

06:01.230 --> 06:04.015
our official company
certificate.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.670
Should you wish to continue
competing for the first prize

06:06.714 --> 06:08.455
you must invent
another game

06:08.498 --> 06:11.022
which the company will arrange to be collected from your home.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.024
Warmest regards, Morodian.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.201
Master Superior of the Profound Games Company.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.508
Ten thousand?

06:18.552 --> 06:21.119
This competition could go
on forever.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.256
A competition that goes
on forever.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.953
An endless competition.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.259
That's it!

06:30.302 --> 06:31.521
Daddy's wrestling game!

06:31.565 --> 06:33.218
[laughter]

06:33.262 --> 06:34.872
Wow! Out cold!

06:34.916 --> 06:36.874
Oh, that Bone Crusher
is an animal.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.746
These are the good guys,
like the Mountie.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.921
Senor--

06:39.964 --> 06:41.226
he fireman's carry

06:41.270 --> 06:42.706
Frankenstein, Choke Bomb,

06:42.750 --> 06:44.404
Steve Lady's Man Johnson,

06:44.447 --> 06:46.231
Killer Manjaro,

06:46.275 --> 06:47.407
the Time of Death,

06:47.450 --> 06:48.799
these are the baddies.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.801
Bone Crusher, Senor--

06:50.845 --> 06:55.893
the Guillotine penalty
of course, dirty tricks.

06:55.937 --> 06:56.720
Knock, knock.

06:56.764 --> 06:57.765
Ivan. Hey, there you are.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.723
Beautiful day
for a bike ride.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
What do you say, son? Hmm?

07:01.508 --> 07:05.076
Concerned about Ivan spending
so much time in his room

07:05.120 --> 07:08.776
his father encouraged him
to take up sports.

07:10.473 --> 07:13.345
Cycling was not a success.

07:13.389 --> 07:17.915
However, the experience inspired Ivan to create Tour De Stars,

07:17.959 --> 07:20.831
the game that propelled him
into the third leg

07:20.875 --> 07:22.833
of the competition.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.836
Dear Ivan, congratulations.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.579
You are one of our top
100 finalists.

07:29.623 --> 07:33.148
This news encouraged Ivan
to keep inventing

07:33.191 --> 07:35.455
but he didn't dare
tell his father

07:35.498 --> 07:40.198
who still dreamt of his son
becoming a great sportsman.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.505
Thank you Mrs. Drago.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.947
These activities were a source
of great inspiration for Ivan.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.471
Over the following months

07:51.514 --> 07:53.777
he submitted five new games

07:53.821 --> 07:55.823
based on the most
popular sports,

07:55.866 --> 07:58.521
each one more amazing
than the last.

07:58.565 --> 08:02.656
Dear Ivan, you are now one
of the top 10 finalists

08:02.699 --> 08:07.312
chosen to compete
for the grand prize.

08:07.356 --> 08:10.228
We await your next invention.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.404
For the final round of
the competition

08:12.448 --> 08:15.712
Ivan's imagination took flight
with the creation

08:15.756 --> 08:18.976
of around the world in 79 days.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.980
No doubt inspired by Mr. Drago's return to his lifelong passion

08:23.024 --> 08:25.809
for hot air ballooning.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.507
Son, up here!

08:33.556 --> 08:34.991
[doorbell]

08:35.035 --> 08:36.428
Ivan.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.653
Dearest Ivan, it is my greatest pleasure to inform you

08:43.697 --> 08:47.352
that you are the winner
of the competition.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.180
Congratulations!

08:49.224 --> 08:52.009
And the prize, our companies
insignia,

08:52.053 --> 08:56.927
a symbol of pride to carry with you for the rest of your life.

08:56.971 --> 09:01.671
The great game
is just beginning.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.979
It's one of those tattoos
you get with bubblegum.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.123
At first Ivan was
so disappointed.

09:19.167 --> 09:23.606
He showed no interest
in the prize.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.390
But by the following day

09:25.434 --> 09:30.700
curiosity had got
the best of him.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.354
And on the third day

09:32.397 --> 09:35.705
he discovered that the
tattoo would not come off.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.273
Ivan!

09:38.316 --> 09:39.883
What is that boy doing up there?

09:39.927 --> 09:42.407
He's indoors all the time,
he's reading comics,

09:42.451 --> 09:45.715
doing puzzles.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.326
There's something
I have to tell you.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.073
What?

09:56.117 --> 09:58.075
I want you to get rid of
this tattoo immediately.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.250
I can't!

09:59.294 --> 10:00.774
It won't come off,
and anyway

10:00.817 --> 10:03.298
it's the only proof that I won
a competition

10:03.341 --> 10:04.429
out of 10,000 people!

10:04.473 --> 10:05.648
Ivan!

10:05.692 --> 10:07.650
Okay, okay.

10:07.694 --> 10:11.436
Maybe we should just try to
calm down and ignore the tattoo

10:11.480 --> 10:13.525
and forget this ridiculous
competition.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.093
It's not a ridiculous
competition!

10:16.137 --> 10:17.268
You don't understand!

10:17.312 --> 10:18.835
I won.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.620
I'm a game maker!

10:20.663 --> 10:22.970
You have no idea
what that symbol means.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.191
You promised you wouldn't
tell him.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.453
Ivan.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.674
I was worried, I had
to tell your father.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.110
Just leave me alone.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.852
I never want to see
you again.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.944
That night driven by
a sinister premonition

10:40.988 --> 10:42.946
Mr. Drago phoned his father

10:42.990 --> 10:45.819
with whom he hadn't
spoken in 10 years.

10:48.386 --> 10:49.779
Ivan.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.302
Wake up.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.478
Visit Zyl, the games capital
of the world.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.959
See the worlds largest
jigsaw puzzle.

10:56.003 --> 10:59.397
Take a stroll around the
famous lost pieces centre.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.313
Lose yourself in the worlds
most complex natural labyrinth

11:02.357 --> 11:06.013
and attend a games workshop
hosted by engineer Gebbler.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.885
Three time winner of the world
renowned tournament

11:08.929 --> 11:10.452
of inventors.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.497
You'll encounter the world
famous magic brain

11:12.541 --> 11:15.979
which will answer any question
you put to it.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.721
Hello everybody,
I'm Nicholas Drago

11:18.765 --> 11:22.551
and it is my great pleasure
to invite you on a tour of Zyl.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.988
All the world's most
exciting games

11:25.032 --> 11:29.863
are right here waiting
for you.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.822
That's my father.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.519
Your grandfather.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.696
My grandfather?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.349
A game maker?

11:38.393 --> 11:41.701
Oh yes, inventor of such world
famous games

11:41.744 --> 11:44.834
as the End of the World Race,
Crystal Cathedral,

11:44.878 --> 11:48.533
and of course the legendary
Giant Jigsaw Puzzles.

11:48.577 --> 11:51.058
Is he still alive?

11:51.101 --> 11:53.016
Yes, he is.

11:53.060 --> 11:56.019
Why haven't you ever
taken me there?

11:56.063 --> 11:59.022
Why haven't I ever met
my grandpa?

11:59.066 --> 12:01.024
Because, Ivan,
ten years ago

12:01.068 --> 12:03.026
I made the decision to cut
all ties to Zyl

12:03.070 --> 12:05.289
and the world of games.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.204
Why?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.859
It's complicated, but just know
that the only reason

12:09.903 --> 12:13.080
I did that was to protect you,
Ivan.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.560
I did it for you.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.563
But now things have changed,

12:18.607 --> 12:24.047
now it's extremely important
that the Drago's are reunited.

12:24.091 --> 12:27.659
We'll go to Zyl on Sunday,
after the balloon race.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.401
Ivan was unable to sleep
that night,

12:30.445 --> 12:32.490
he wrote a beautiful letter
to his mother

12:32.534 --> 12:35.580
saying that he was sorry.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.626
By daybreak he was dressed,

12:37.669 --> 12:40.237
ready to go with them
to the balloon race.

12:40.281 --> 12:43.980
[Radio]: Weekend forecast:
moderate to strong south
easterly winds.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.591
We're expecting blue skies
throughout the day,

12:46.635 --> 12:49.159
mostly clear in the evening
now stay tuned...

12:49.203 --> 12:51.248
Perfect ballooning conditions.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.904
He'd even been thinking about
a gift for his grandfather.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.776
And what could be
more appropriate

12:56.819 --> 12:59.779
than a new improved
version of his last game,

12:59.822 --> 13:03.783
renamed Flight to Zyl.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.437
[gunshot]

13:06.481 --> 13:08.048
Woo!

13:12.356 --> 13:14.054
Ivan!

13:24.499 --> 13:27.981
As usual, the weather forecast
was wrong.

13:28.024 --> 13:31.811
Conditions were suitable,
the winds were light,

13:31.854 --> 13:33.943
which is why no one
could understand

13:33.987 --> 13:38.556
how the accident happened.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.384
What could have caused
the Drago's balloon

13:40.428 --> 13:43.823
to separate from the others
and drift away?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.877
In the days that followed
Ivan asked himself

13:54.921 --> 13:58.925
over and over again how
this could have happened.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.151
But there were many challenges
to face

14:08.195 --> 14:12.547
before he would find the answer to that question.

14:19.902 --> 14:23.775
[doorbell]

14:36.832 --> 14:38.878
I don't want to come here.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.707
The judge decided
what's best for you.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.188
You should think yourself lucky.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.016
That's right, young man.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.801
Possum is the best school
for miles around,

14:49.845 --> 14:55.198
some very important men
went there.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.940
But the school,

14:57.984 --> 14:59.202
it's sinking.

14:59.246 --> 15:02.379
Oh yes, they say it was built
on a swamp.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.904
There's plenty of floors.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.209
They just make a new entrance

15:06.253 --> 15:08.820
whenever the old one
gets too low.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.220
It happens everywhere.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.875
Look at Venice, it's been
sinking for years.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.598
Good morning, Mr. Drago.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.384
Welcome to Possum.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.609
I hope you realize
how fortunate you are

15:58.653 --> 16:01.177
that the court chose
to send you here.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.006
To Possum.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.791
Since this academic institution
opened its doors

16:06.835 --> 16:13.102
over 100 years ago it has scaled
the heights of excellence.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.104
But the school is sinking.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.454
Oh, you've noticed.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.283
It is something of an
architectural conundrum.

16:20.327 --> 16:26.550
Personally, I believe it is
due to the weight of knowledge.

16:26.594 --> 16:31.033
Now, if we could just complete
the formalities.

16:33.035 --> 16:36.473
Sign here, and here,
and here.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.475
Congratulations
Master Drago,

16:38.519 --> 16:42.653
you are now officially
a Possum boarder.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.046
Right then, I'm sure you are

16:44.090 --> 16:45.134
I'm not going to live here.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.831
I must go to my grandfather
in Zyl,

16:46.875 --> 16:48.920
has anyone told him I'm here?

16:48.964 --> 16:50.531
Grandfather?

16:53.360 --> 16:58.234
In case you hadn't noticed
Master Drago you are an orphan.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.323
As such if no one comes
to claim you

17:00.367 --> 17:02.412
then you cannot leave
this building

17:02.456 --> 17:04.022
until you are 18 of course

17:04.066 --> 17:07.329
and then you are free
to do whatever you like.

17:07.374 --> 17:10.724
Frau Bloom, could you come in
please?

17:12.901 --> 17:15.338
Frau Bloom will be
your personal guardian,

17:15.382 --> 17:17.165
she will see to it
that you never lack

17:17.210 --> 17:22.214
for the warmth of
family affection.

17:22.258 --> 17:27.307
Frau Bloom, please take Master
Drago's case to the dormitory.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.677
[Class]: Good morning
Principal Possum.

17:54.421 --> 17:58.555
Good morning Professor Katz.

17:58.599 --> 18:06.215
It appears one of your
pupils doesn't find it necessary

18:06.259 --> 18:12.221
to say good morning
to his school principal.

18:12.265 --> 18:16.443
I would like you all to inform
me of his name.

18:16.486 --> 18:21.665
Or are you all prepared to pay
the price for his disobedience?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.102
Levinchen

18:23.145 --> 18:27.106
Levinchen.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.586
I should have guessed.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.415
Anyway, I'm here today
to introduce you

18:32.459 --> 18:36.767
to a new member of
the class, Ivan Drago.

18:36.811 --> 18:41.032
[violin playing]

18:41.076 --> 18:44.601
Master Pluncket.

18:44.645 --> 18:52.653
This class is not
a music class.

18:52.696 --> 18:57.614
Anyway, Master Drago will serve
as a good example

18:57.658 --> 18:59.442
for you all

18:59.486 --> 19:03.794
that not everyone is fortunate
enough to have a family.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.145
Let alone one with
sufficient means

19:06.188 --> 19:10.801
to send you to a great
institution such as ours.

19:10.845 --> 19:16.372
We are happy to welcome for
the first time in many years

19:16.416 --> 19:19.158
an orphan to Possum.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.898
Carry on Professor Katz.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.813
Where'd you get
that fake tattoo?

19:22.857 --> 19:25.468
Master Krebs.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.992
Talking without permission.

19:28.036 --> 19:31.518
That's yet another black mark
for you.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.829
That was your fault, Drago.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.397
You'll pay for this.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.846
Next!

19:55.890 --> 19:59.415
Listen dummy, this version
is out of date.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.505
Now come on everyone,
you all know how this works.

20:02.549 --> 20:06.901
The more cards you buy the
more chance you have of winning.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.080
Now get out of here
before I lose my temper.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.952
Hey. What are you playing?

20:14.996 --> 20:17.346
Compound fracture.

20:17.390 --> 20:21.524
It's the second edition
of Ruthless Wrestling.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.526
That's weird.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.528
This is just like a game
I invented

20:25.572 --> 20:27.051
called Endless Wrestling.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.706
You invented a game?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.447
Yeah right.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.884
It was based
on the TV show.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.278
I wouldn't know, none of us
are allowed to watch TV.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.541
If you're such an expert
maybe you can give me a hand

20:38.585 --> 20:40.151
I'm getting thrashed here.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.545
Sure, I know this game
inside out.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.983
Hang on, where are
all the good guys?

20:46.027 --> 20:48.290
Look, Frankensteins
signature move is a choke bomb

20:48.334 --> 20:51.946
which beats the Bone Crusher's
guillotine choke

20:51.989 --> 20:54.992
and counters the Parking
Attendants dirty tricks.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.256
So, you can't lose.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.563
What's a Guillotine Choke?

21:00.607 --> 21:02.739
Okay, look.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.089
Bone Crusher's signature move
is the Guillotine Choke,

21:05.133 --> 21:08.571
like this.

21:08.615 --> 21:12.619
But as the Undertakers signature
move the Body Scissors like this

21:12.662 --> 21:15.274
That's a crap signature move!

21:16.927 --> 21:18.146
Who said you could
draw this?

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
I didn't draw it,
it's real.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.934
Where did you get it?

21:23.978 --> 21:29.636
I won it in a competition.

21:29.679 --> 21:33.117
Did Morodian give it to you?

21:33.161 --> 21:34.945
Yes.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.295
What did he say?

21:36.338 --> 21:37.774
He said he met Morodian.

21:37.818 --> 21:38.949
So you make new games.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.299
Silence you idiots!

21:40.342 --> 21:42.997
He's a liar.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.306
The only one who knows Morodian
around here is me.

21:47.349 --> 21:51.962
And if I don't have a tattoo
no one has a tattoo,

21:52.006 --> 21:57.359
especially a pathetic
little worm like you, Drago.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.622
[bell ringing]

21:59.666 --> 22:03.147
Come on, let's get
out of here.

22:03.191 --> 22:08.370
Saved by the bell,
this time.

22:08.414 --> 22:12.156
Remember Drago,
we're the Lofties.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.986
We rule this school.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.467
Be aware that you
will have electricity

22:18.511 --> 22:23.167
from sunset until
2100 hours precisely

22:23.211 --> 22:28.216
for the sole purpose of reading
educational books.

22:30.523 --> 22:35.441
As it's your first day I won't
ask you to wash the dishes.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.749
Time to go to the dormitory.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.925
What about dessert?

22:41.969 --> 22:47.235
This institution has never
offered dessert to pupils.

22:56.418 --> 23:02.772
It may seem a little big
at first,

23:02.816 --> 23:08.778
but in no time it will feel
just like home.

23:13.435 --> 23:17.439
Report to the dining hall
at 0700 hours.

23:45.772 --> 23:50.820
[creaking floor sounds]

23:50.864 --> 23:54.607
Psst! Psst!

24:05.226 --> 24:07.750
[whispering]
Psst! Ivan!

24:07.794 --> 24:10.318
Ivan, don't be afraid!

24:10.361 --> 24:14.670
We're in the same class,
I'm a boarder here too.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.933
That's not true.

24:16.977 --> 24:20.676
Only boys go to this school.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.373
Are you a ghost?

24:22.417 --> 24:26.029
No silly, I know only boys
are meant to go here

24:26.073 --> 24:28.684
that's why I had to make
myself invisible.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.165
Anunciacion.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.782
Principle Possum told me
that I was the only boarder.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.523
Well, that's what he thinks.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.004
I live here too,
inside the walls.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.223
I know this building better
than anyone,

24:46.267 --> 24:49.139
even Principal Possum.

24:49.183 --> 24:52.665
What do your parents think
of all of this?

24:52.708 --> 24:55.972
The same thing that happened
to you happened to me too.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.800
What?

24:57.844 --> 25:00.020
Hot air balloon accident?

25:00.063 --> 25:02.501
No, not so original.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.503
Car accident.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.813
When Krebs saw your tattoo
in class today

25:10.857 --> 25:13.163
I could see how angry he was.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.514
In class?

25:15.557 --> 25:17.341
But you weren't in class.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.647
Yes I was,

25:18.691 --> 25:21.171
above the blackboard
behind the painting.

25:21.215 --> 25:23.086
I see everything that happens.

25:23.130 --> 25:27.177
Well, everything
except the blackboard.

25:27.221 --> 25:31.834
This guy Krebs, how come
everyone puts up with him?

25:31.878 --> 25:35.534
Up until recently everyone
thought he was a joke.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.710
Then Morodian visits
Principal Possum and Krebs

25:37.753 --> 25:39.668
suddenly has all these
strange games.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.540
Morodian came to the school?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.106
Did you meet him?

25:43.150 --> 25:45.544
I only saw him
from a distance.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.850
They met in secret.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.070
From that moment
everything changed,

25:50.113 --> 25:52.942
Krebs seemed to have all the
games the minute they came out.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.902
And he was the only one who knew
all the secret playing tips.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.599
What's he like?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
A little--

26:00.428 --> 26:03.866
Drago?

26:03.910 --> 26:05.694
Mr. Drago.

26:05.738 --> 26:09.045
Are you talking in your sleep?

26:09.089 --> 26:11.265
Remember Mr. Drago.

26:11.308 --> 26:15.574
Silence is one of Possum's
hallmarks.

26:22.929 --> 26:25.279
Do you want to hear more
about Krebs?

26:29.631 --> 26:32.939
I'd prefer it if you told me how
to escape from here.

26:32.982 --> 26:33.940
Escape?

26:33.983 --> 26:35.724
You're really leaving
so soon?

26:35.768 --> 26:36.725
You just got here.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.074
I need to meet my grandfather,

26:38.118 --> 26:41.643
he's a world famous game maker.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.168
He lives in Zyl.

26:45.212 --> 26:49.738
The contest I won
and my parents accident,

26:49.782 --> 26:53.263
my grandfather is the only one
who can help me find out.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.483
How are you going
to get there?

26:55.526 --> 26:57.920
Next Friday is a holiday.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.967
I'll just say I have to go home
for books and clothes.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.101
[chanting]
Bone Crusher!

27:05.145 --> 27:06.929
Bone Crusher!

27:06.973 --> 27:08.278
One week.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.019
You have been here
less than one week

27:10.063 --> 27:13.675
and now everyone plays games
but in a very different manner.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.373
Listen.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.766
[chanting]
Bone Crusher!

27:17.810 --> 27:19.028
Bone Crusher!

27:19.072 --> 27:20.421
Bone Crusher!

27:20.464 --> 27:24.381
You Drago are nothing short
of a noxious plague

27:24.425 --> 27:27.297
upon our educational
institution.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.995
A plague?

27:29.038 --> 27:33.347
Yes, Drago.
A plague.

27:41.355 --> 27:45.794
You're going to be grounded,
permanently.

27:45.838 --> 27:49.145
That's not fair,
you can't do that.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.671
From now on all days off
are suspended.

27:52.714 --> 27:57.937
No weekends, no holidays,
not even public holidays.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.157
Frau Bloom!

28:01.201 --> 28:07.163
[children chatting]

28:07.207 --> 28:08.861
[chanting]
Guillotine Choke!

28:08.904 --> 28:10.514
Guillotine Choke!

28:10.558 --> 28:12.647
Guillotine Choke!

29:03.829 --> 29:06.962
Professor Katz?

29:07.006 --> 29:09.530
May I go to the bathroom?

29:15.188 --> 29:20.584
[children talking and yelling]

29:20.628 --> 29:22.064
[chanting]
Frankenstein!

29:22.108 --> 29:23.892
Frankenstein!

29:23.936 --> 29:27.069
Frankenstein!

29:27.113 --> 29:29.245
Hey, Drago!

29:29.289 --> 29:32.771
[children talking and yelling]

29:41.127 --> 29:42.824
Ivan!

29:46.306 --> 29:49.091
Thanks, they're saying
they want revenge.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.441
It's Krebs, he hasn't been
to school the last few days.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.791
What does it have to do
with me?

29:52.834 --> 29:54.096
He tried to give himself
a tattoo

29:54.140 --> 29:58.622
and now he's in hospital
with a nasty infection.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.363
This is my room.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.539
I was really lucky to find such
a good place to study.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.977
Our classroom is just
behind that wall.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.636
Here, I wanted to show
you something.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.987
I saw Principal Possum
opening this.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.688
And I also found all these.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.867
He spent all last night
trying to do this jigsaw puzzle,

30:25.911 --> 30:28.348
by morning
he'd thrown it out.

30:36.356 --> 30:39.489
What is he doing now?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.840
There's a message, channel 3 -

30:41.883 --> 30:44.755
Now he's going
through your desk.

30:56.767 --> 31:01.207
[bell ringing]

31:01.250 --> 31:03.557
If you don't get back right now
the punishment will be worse.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.733
Worse?

31:05.776 --> 31:09.041
Keep an eye on him,
I'm almost done.

31:13.088 --> 31:16.048
Channel 3 at midnight.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.373
I can't believe this is the only
TV in the whole school.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.636
Old Possum doesn't believe
in television.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.812
Except when he's watching it.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.477
Great.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.134
What time is it?

31:59.178 --> 32:00.266
It's almost midnight.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.745
[choppy voice]
Dice making...

32:01.789 --> 32:04.096
remember...

32:06.620 --> 32:09.753
so if I place half
on one side

32:09.797 --> 32:13.453
what should I place
on the other one?

32:13.496 --> 32:18.240
The material in which dice
are made of is very important.

32:18.284 --> 32:23.332
For example cardboard
is highly unacceptable.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.818
Rubber is also not acceptable.

32:34.387 --> 32:37.956
This will be all for today,
see you next class.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.827
Tomorrow at the same time
on Tele-Zyl

32:39.870 --> 32:42.003
make your own game
with Professor Tramunte.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.702
That concludes our broadcast
A, good night.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.979
We'd better return this.

33:05.157 --> 33:10.901
This is an important message
for Ivan Drago.

33:10.945 --> 33:16.820
Ivan, I hope you're
seeing this.

33:16.864 --> 33:20.128
I'm Nicholas,
your grandfather.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.043
I've been trying to find you

33:22.087 --> 33:27.179
ever since I heard of
your parents tragic accident.

33:27.222 --> 33:30.878
I went to that fortress
of a school you go to

33:30.921 --> 33:33.837
and they turned me away.

33:33.881 --> 33:39.017
Ivan, you are the youngest
in a long line of Drago's,

33:39.060 --> 33:44.674
the most famous games makers
in the world.

33:44.718 --> 33:50.028
I'll be broadcasting
this message every night

33:50.071 --> 34:00.038
and I hope that fate brings
you safe and sound to Zyl soon.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.088
I do have a grandfather.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.525
He's waiting for me in Zyl.

34:10.570 --> 34:13.181
I'll escape from
this horrible school.

34:13.225 --> 34:16.271
That won't be easy, Ivan.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.795
What if I managed
to close it down?

34:18.839 --> 34:21.059
How are you going
to do that?

34:24.453 --> 34:26.889
Take me to the library.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.717
It's two floors down.

34:28.762 --> 34:31.373
Nobody ever goes down there,

34:31.417 --> 34:34.724
they think it's haunted.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.379
As each floor sinks
they close it.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.208
This one was abandoned
10 years ago.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.556
Really?

34:41.601 --> 34:43.559
They say the last boarder
who tried to escape

34:43.603 --> 34:46.214
got chained to the post
in the library.

34:46.257 --> 34:48.434
When it sunk he drowned.

34:48.476 --> 34:50.088
And after all these years

34:50.130 --> 34:52.568
he's still trying to come up
for air,

34:52.612 --> 34:55.789
and when he does
you'll hear a splash.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.410
Actually, you know what,

35:08.454 --> 35:10.282
maybe there's no point
in going down there.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.022
The damp will have destroyed
all the books

35:12.066 --> 35:14.764
and we won't be able to find
anything in the dark.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.941
Ivan.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.161
Look.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.616
What do you think we should
be looking for?

35:40.660 --> 35:43.706
The school's mystery.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.144
A buildings secret?

35:46.187 --> 35:47.667
There's got to be a structural
weakness

35:47.710 --> 35:49.625
that is making
the building sink.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.714
It just needs to sink a few feet
in one day

35:51.758 --> 35:54.369
and they'll close down
the school.

35:54.413 --> 35:57.720
But it's only been sinking
one floor every twenty years.

35:57.764 --> 36:00.680
Maybe we can speed up
the process.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.381
What were you saying?

36:06.425 --> 36:09.341
Don't worry,
they're only stories.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.716
Look at this.

36:43.113 --> 36:50.208
[gasping]

36:50.251 --> 36:51.687
We're taking out a book,

36:51.731 --> 36:53.863
shouldn't you fill out
a library card?

36:53.907 --> 36:57.954
[cricket sounds]

37:15.929 --> 37:18.758
Here, look at this.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.673
Pass it along.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.811
[chatting]

37:28.855 --> 37:30.639
Don't ask, just take it.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.080
Oh yeah, we just found out.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.386
I'm so excited.

37:38.430 --> 37:41.433
I know, I wonder what
it's going to be.

37:47.787 --> 37:53.967
[chatter]

38:00.887 --> 38:02.323
Frau Bloom,

38:02.367 --> 38:04.499
keep a close eye on
Master Drago today.

38:04.543 --> 38:08.155
[chatter]

38:19.384 --> 38:20.515
It's clear.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.909
Ivan, Principal Possum
is gone!

38:30.003 --> 38:32.788
Gentlemen!

38:32.832 --> 38:34.964
What you are about
to take part in

38:35.008 --> 38:37.315
is not just any game.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.622
It is one of the oldest games
in history.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.320
A treasure hunt.

38:42.363 --> 38:43.886
It is -

38:43.930 --> 38:46.236
[whispering]
Psst, Ivan! Over here!

38:49.544 --> 38:50.937
What are you doing here?

38:50.980 --> 38:52.808
I thought we agreed to meet
at the railway station.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.375
I had to make Frau Bloom
secure.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.813
Why haven't you started
the game yet?

38:57.857 --> 38:59.075
Ivan.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.468
I needed to get as many players
as possible

39:00.512 --> 39:01.643
or else it won't work.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.036
There's only one train
a week to Zyl

39:03.079 --> 39:04.167
and it leaves in an hour.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.865
Don't waste any more time.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.043
Now, is everyone ready?

39:10.086 --> 39:11.349
[All]: Yes!

39:11.392 --> 39:13.351
Yes.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.917
He's here.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.834
Okay, here are the clues.

39:18.878 --> 39:22.403
A man of marble proudly waits,

39:22.447 --> 39:25.493
within his hands
he holds your fates.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.017
His memory long
but his sight is short

39:28.061 --> 39:33.414
and tucked in his glasses
you'll find what you sought.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.676
Another clue.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.851
To the principals office.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.418
Come on!

39:37.462 --> 39:38.898
Pinned to their names
the butterflies sleep,

39:38.941 --> 39:44.033
spiders don't weave and locusts
don't leap.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.252
Weave, I know!

39:45.295 --> 39:46.514
Come on lets go!

39:46.558 --> 39:48.386
These are the things
he pretends he owns

39:48.429 --> 39:53.260
as he hears the rattle
of his yellowing bones.

39:53.303 --> 39:54.304
I got it!

39:54.348 --> 39:55.784
Yes!

39:55.828 --> 39:57.307
You didn't get it?

39:57.351 --> 39:58.874
So, what do we do now?

39:58.918 --> 40:01.094
Just follow the others.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.315
Drago!

40:05.359 --> 40:10.103
[cheering]

40:17.763 --> 40:18.764
I'm going to get it!

40:18.807 --> 40:19.808
I saw it first!

40:19.852 --> 40:20.896
Mine!

40:20.940 --> 40:22.463
Give me it!

40:22.507 --> 40:24.247
No, no, no.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.771
Going somewhere Drago?

40:25.814 --> 40:28.991
Bleach, acids,
abrasive cleaning pads.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.428
And sandpaper.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.647
Ugh!!!

40:32.691 --> 40:34.301
[door rattles]

40:38.479 --> 40:39.915
Frau Bloom, help!

40:39.959 --> 40:41.090
I'm locked in!

40:41.134 --> 40:44.137
Can you hear me?

40:44.180 --> 40:45.791
If it doesn't come off after

40:49.490 --> 40:52.319
[door rattles]

40:52.362 --> 40:58.717
[crowd yelling]

41:00.849 --> 41:02.982
Good lord, no.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.984
The sinking points.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.812
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

41:10.380 --> 41:11.991
Endless Wrestling!

41:13.819 --> 41:15.168
I've got it! I've got it!

41:19.389 --> 41:21.217
[struggling grunts]

41:21.261 --> 41:23.785
Don't let him get away!

41:23.829 --> 41:25.352
Krebs!

41:29.356 --> 41:37.146
[ground rumbling]

41:37.190 --> 41:40.193
He dreams of the future,
full of glory and pomp.

41:40.236 --> 41:46.504
As slowly the school
sinks into the swamp.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.986
This way, over here!

41:51.030 --> 41:52.553
Oh no!

41:52.597 --> 41:55.034
We've got to get them
all out!

41:55.077 --> 41:56.557
My violin, have you seen
my violin?

41:56.601 --> 41:57.558
Have you seen it?

41:57.602 --> 41:58.646
Oh my god!

41:58.690 --> 41:59.342
Has anyone seen it?

41:59.386 --> 41:59.995
Principal Possum!

42:00.039 --> 42:01.519
Just a minute!

42:03.390 --> 42:04.522
Those ones too!

42:04.565 --> 42:05.566
You alright?

42:05.610 --> 42:10.005
[coughing]

42:10.049 --> 42:10.919
Alright.

42:10.963 --> 42:14.357
That's one, two, three, four,

42:14.401 --> 42:16.534
yeah that's the last four,
everyone is safe.

42:16.577 --> 42:20.059
Oh if not for you Ivan
we would still be in there.

42:20.102 --> 42:23.236
[chanting]
Ivan! Ivan! Ivan!

42:23.279 --> 42:26.021
Ivan! Ivan!

42:26.065 --> 42:27.022
You'll pay.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.371
Pay for this, Drago!

42:28.415 --> 42:30.199
One for the press,
thank you.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.592
Ivan! Ivan! Ivan!

42:31.636 --> 42:32.680
I don't care if they think
you're a hero, Drago.

42:32.724 --> 42:34.552
I know you planned
this whole thing,

42:34.595 --> 42:36.249
you won't get away with it.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.685
Master Drago!

42:37.729 --> 42:39.687
You cannot leave this school!

42:39.731 --> 42:43.212
You are still grounded!

42:43.256 --> 42:45.258
Drago!

42:55.616 --> 43:01.535
[panting]

43:14.287 --> 43:16.071
Did the school really sink?

43:16.115 --> 43:17.595
Uh, completely.

43:17.638 --> 43:19.248
Completely?

43:19.292 --> 43:21.599
I didn't think anything
that drastic would happen.

43:21.642 --> 43:24.340
It was only meant to sink
a few feet.

43:24.384 --> 43:25.994
All aboard!

43:27.474 --> 43:28.649
Where will you live now?

43:28.693 --> 43:30.259
Back with my Aunt Elena.

43:30.303 --> 43:33.741
I ran away and now it's time
I went home.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.743
Thank you.

43:35.787 --> 43:37.484
Good bye Anunciacion.

43:37.527 --> 43:39.399
[train horn]

43:52.847 --> 43:54.675
Why don't you come with me?

43:54.719 --> 43:56.024
I could say you're my sister.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.156
No, Ivan.

43:57.199 --> 44:00.115
It's you they're waiting for.

44:00.159 --> 44:01.769
Will you come visit me
in Zyl someday?

44:01.813 --> 44:04.642
Of course, I'll pop up
when you least expect it.

44:37.544 --> 44:38.327
Tickets!

44:38.371 --> 44:40.547
Tickets please!

44:43.202 --> 44:45.334
You're getting off at Zyl?

44:45.378 --> 44:47.728
Yes, why?

44:47.772 --> 44:51.384
Normally people only get on
the train at Zyl.

44:56.084 --> 44:58.391
Tickets! Tickets please!

45:10.925 --> 45:13.406
You seem to like drawing.

45:13.449 --> 45:16.539
Well, just to sketch
my ideas.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.193
Inventions.

45:18.237 --> 45:23.198
You know, I keep finding
lost property in the carriages.

45:23.242 --> 45:28.029
Look at this, I saw an ad
for good illustration courses

45:28.073 --> 45:32.555
in this old comic book.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.209
Zyl is our next stop.

45:34.253 --> 45:37.604
Don't fall asleep.

47:00.339 --> 47:02.645
What if he doesn't see anyone
and got back on the train.

47:02.689 --> 47:04.212
Well, obviously that would
be your fault.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.997
My fault?

47:11.045 --> 47:12.830
Ivan?

47:12.873 --> 47:14.875
Sorry we weren't here
to meet you.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.485
Your grandfather had us waiting.

47:16.529 --> 47:17.312
I'm Knight.

47:17.356 --> 47:18.313
I'm Bishop.

47:18.357 --> 47:19.488
They call us...

47:19.532 --> 47:20.838
[Both]: The Checkmates.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.535
I'm Ivan Drago.

47:23.710 --> 47:24.972
Hey.

47:25.016 --> 47:27.670
What's that?

47:27.714 --> 47:28.889
What?

47:28.933 --> 47:30.760
I won it in a competition.

47:30.804 --> 47:33.154
You know what that means
in Zyl?

47:33.198 --> 47:36.679
It's the logo of the Profound
Games company.

47:36.723 --> 47:38.638
What's it got to do with Zyl?

47:40.727 --> 47:43.034
Come on, your grandfather
will explain.

47:43.077 --> 47:44.513
Where is my grandfather?

47:44.557 --> 47:45.993
He sent us to meet
every train

47:46.037 --> 47:48.996
so there was someone
to welcome you.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.955
He hoped you got his message.

47:54.654 --> 47:57.526
Oh, that's Zyl TV station.

47:57.570 --> 48:00.181
That's the museum.

48:00.225 --> 48:04.011
It's the first place people
visit when they come to Zyl.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.144
Except nobody comes to Zyl.

48:12.106 --> 48:14.195
The mayor had these made
a few years ago.

48:14.239 --> 48:16.589
The mayor, as in your dad?

48:19.244 --> 48:22.812
Yeah, okay, my dad.

48:22.856 --> 48:25.119
The thing is he puts them there
so that the train passengers

48:25.163 --> 48:27.774
won't see how deserted
the place has got.

48:41.005 --> 48:42.920
Hello, Checkmates.

48:50.144 --> 48:51.841
The magic brain!

48:51.885 --> 48:54.235
I saw it in the film about Zyl.

48:54.279 --> 48:57.630
Yes, it's the original.

48:57.673 --> 49:00.676
But it's closed down.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.765
Why?

49:02.809 --> 49:05.116
Your grandfather will explain.

49:27.051 --> 49:29.053
[knocking]

49:40.542 --> 49:42.501
Nicholas?

49:46.157 --> 49:51.814
Nicholas!

49:51.858 --> 49:53.903
Ivan?

49:55.862 --> 49:58.169
It's you!

49:58.212 --> 50:02.390
Oh, you solved the puzzle
I sent you!

50:02.434 --> 50:06.133
Oh well done, oh!

50:06.177 --> 50:07.134
Oh.

50:07.178 --> 50:09.876
[coughs]

50:09.919 --> 50:11.660
Please excuse my coughing,

50:11.704 --> 50:15.055
it's the blasted fans
I have to keep on.

50:15.099 --> 50:16.665
Thank you, Checkmates!

50:16.709 --> 50:20.017
I'm leaving the keys to
the truck over here Mr. Drago.

50:20.060 --> 50:21.844
By the way Ivan,
if you like fishing

50:21.888 --> 50:23.759
we go to the River Rubic
every day,

50:23.803 --> 50:24.847
you should come.

50:24.891 --> 50:26.240
Bye.

50:26.284 --> 50:28.025
Come on, lets get
you settled in.

50:28.068 --> 50:30.723
Come on, come on.

50:30.766 --> 50:33.421
My grandson.

50:40.994 --> 50:45.738
Little out of fashion
don't you think?

50:52.266 --> 50:55.530
Your father and his friends.

50:55.574 --> 50:58.881
He didn't really talk much
about growing up in Zyl.

50:58.925 --> 51:04.974
Your father grew up with a
different approach to life.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.585
I never thought I'd have
a son

51:06.628 --> 51:10.284
who did not share
my love of games.

51:10.328 --> 51:15.376
Grandpa, I want you
to read this.

51:15.420 --> 51:18.727
No one ever knew where
they ended up on that race.

51:18.771 --> 51:23.210
No one told us that they
had found their bodies,

51:23.254 --> 51:25.778
and then I found that.

51:29.173 --> 51:31.392
This is a comic book,
Ivan.

51:31.436 --> 51:36.571
I know it's not fair but we have
to learn to accept our losses

51:36.615 --> 51:41.228
no matter how
incomprehensible they may seem.

51:41.272 --> 51:43.361
Hot air ballooning.

51:46.277 --> 51:49.758
Oh my goodness.

51:49.802 --> 51:54.415
Listen, we have each other now.

51:54.459 --> 51:58.463
You must be hungry
after your journey,

51:58.506 --> 52:01.030
I'll fix us some dinner.

52:05.296 --> 52:07.689
So, young Ivan.

52:07.733 --> 52:11.302
Tell me about your interest
in games.

52:11.345 --> 52:14.870
Well, I invented some games
for a competition

52:14.914 --> 52:20.137
that had over 10,000 contestants
and I ended up winning.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.268
Ohhh!

52:21.312 --> 52:24.532
This was the first prize.

52:24.576 --> 52:27.274
It was sent to me
by Mr. Morodian,

52:27.318 --> 52:29.972
have you heard of him?

52:30.016 --> 52:34.063
Your father loved spaghetti.

52:34.107 --> 52:35.717
Do you know Morodian?

52:35.761 --> 52:40.983
Ivan, you are now
with me here.

52:41.027 --> 52:46.989
Zyl is the world capital
for games inventions.

52:47.033 --> 52:49.818
Grandpa I'm, I'm happy
to be here

52:49.862 --> 52:52.081
I just...

52:52.125 --> 52:56.390
I couldn't help noticing
the town it seems a bit quiet.

52:56.434 --> 52:58.000
Well, that's true.

52:58.044 --> 53:01.003
We have seen better times,

53:01.047 --> 53:03.354
but those of us
who stayed in Zyl

53:03.397 --> 53:07.184
feel that the glory days
will return to us here.

53:07.227 --> 53:13.886
After all, it only takes
one game to change everything.

53:13.929 --> 53:16.671
Dessert?

53:16.715 --> 53:19.674
Coming right up.

53:19.718 --> 53:24.113
Now, are you working on
anything new?

53:24.157 --> 53:27.073
Well, I am working on
something new.

53:27.116 --> 53:29.684
It's kind of like
a spinning top.

53:29.728 --> 53:34.733
One side makes a player
invisible to his opponents.

53:34.776 --> 53:36.082
The way it works at the moment

53:36.125 --> 53:37.953
players don't have an equal
chance of winning.

53:37.997 --> 53:40.217
You can't let that hold
you back,

53:40.260 --> 53:44.221
you play a lot of board games
with mismatched sides.

53:44.264 --> 53:46.353
Do you know any of the famous
hunting games,

53:46.397 --> 53:47.876
do you know Comycan?

53:47.920 --> 53:49.791
No.

53:49.835 --> 53:54.535
Well, your grandmother
won the world championship

53:54.579 --> 53:57.799
for five consecutive years.

53:57.843 --> 54:01.890
To be honest I've never
actually played a board game

54:01.934 --> 54:03.283
against anyone else.

54:03.327 --> 54:04.545
Oh my god.

54:04.589 --> 54:07.069
At home my parents.

54:07.113 --> 54:09.115
Oh no, we can't have that.

54:09.158 --> 54:10.899
Follow me.

54:10.943 --> 54:14.251
Some people call it
Inca Chess,

54:14.294 --> 54:19.560
but others know it as
the Puma and the Dogs.

54:19.604 --> 54:26.567
But if you're the puma
it's one against twelve?

54:26.611 --> 54:27.960
Correct.

54:28.003 --> 54:32.094
As in all hunting games
the sides are mismatched,

54:32.138 --> 54:36.751
but if he's smart the puma can
still win the game.

54:36.795 --> 54:40.407
You must always have
a strategy,

54:40.451 --> 54:45.760
use short rapid strokes
and he takes by leaping.

54:45.804 --> 54:47.980
Comme ca, comme ca.

54:48.023 --> 54:50.287
Create spaces for yourself

54:50.330 --> 54:55.117
and you eliminate dogs
one by one.

54:55.161 --> 54:57.468
And Comycan.

54:57.511 --> 54:59.644
Shall we play a game?

54:59.687 --> 55:01.820
What do you want,
puma or dogs?

55:01.863 --> 55:02.951
The puma.

55:02.995 --> 55:06.433
No, alright alright.

55:06.477 --> 55:09.175
Go on.

55:09.218 --> 55:16.356
The first key to victory
is never giving up hope

55:16.400 --> 55:19.446
no matter how many opponents

55:19.490 --> 55:23.320
even if the odds are stacked
against you.

55:29.674 --> 55:32.981
And Comycan.

55:33.025 --> 55:35.984
How were you able to beat me
so quickly?

55:36.028 --> 55:42.817
A game like Comycan
requires skill, not luck.

55:42.861 --> 55:45.516
Rematch?

55:50.434 --> 55:53.175
Grandpa, I think
this competition

55:53.219 --> 55:56.222
is somehow linked
to my parents.

55:56.265 --> 56:02.707
The second key to success
is concentration.

56:04.883 --> 56:07.059
Look.

56:18.766 --> 56:19.941
What's up with you,
Ivan?

56:19.985 --> 56:22.509
You haven't said a word all day.

56:22.553 --> 56:25.033
I'm trying to figure
everything out.

56:25.077 --> 56:28.254
I've never met Morodian
and he's everywhere.

56:28.297 --> 56:30.082
I thought my grandpa
could give me answers

56:30.125 --> 56:31.910
about what happened
to my parents,

56:31.953 --> 56:34.216
he doesn't want
to talk about it.

56:34.260 --> 56:37.698
I think the explanation is
the one my father always gives,

56:37.742 --> 56:42.224
everything bad is
Morodian's fault.

56:42.268 --> 56:44.313
I have to see
the magic brain,

56:44.357 --> 56:46.620
it's the only way to get
an answer in Zyl.

56:46.664 --> 56:49.623
I told you it's temporarily
closed.

56:49.667 --> 56:51.320
Temporarily closed?

56:51.364 --> 56:53.453
But I've never seen it open.

56:53.497 --> 56:56.456
Look, my father promised me
they would open it again.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.458
Yeah, well your father promises
a lot of stuff.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.068
He promised to prune
the old labyrinth

57:00.112 --> 57:01.548
and now it's scarier
than before.

57:01.592 --> 57:03.550
If someone goes in
they never come out.

57:03.594 --> 57:05.900
And what about Zyl TV
broadcasting in colour?

57:05.944 --> 57:07.467
If he didn't manage
any of that

57:07.511 --> 57:09.251
there's a fat chance of him
reopening the magic brain.

57:09.295 --> 57:11.297
Shut your mouth, Knight.

57:11.340 --> 57:13.430
There is a chance.

57:22.482 --> 57:24.005
For the record
this is the first time

57:24.049 --> 57:26.878
I've ever stolen anything
from my father.

57:46.071 --> 57:50.162
Oh my goodness.

58:02.740 --> 58:04.742
[clicking sounds]

58:27.068 --> 58:28.505
Ivan.

58:28.548 --> 58:29.984
Do you want us
to leave?

58:30.028 --> 58:31.159
Are you crazy?

58:31.203 --> 58:32.857
This is the first question
in 20 years,

58:32.900 --> 58:35.033
I'm not going to miss it.

58:40.386 --> 58:43.258
Magic Brain,

58:43.302 --> 58:48.655
can you explain the link
between this, Morodian

58:48.699 --> 58:49.743
and what happened
to my parents

58:49.787 --> 58:52.572
during that balloon race?

58:52.616 --> 58:56.576
[clanging sounds]

58:56.620 --> 59:01.886
[mumbles]

59:01.929 --> 59:05.367
Ivan, I think you should ask
simpler questions, you know?

59:05.411 --> 59:07.239
Yes or no answers.

59:07.282 --> 59:09.415
Okay.

59:11.156 --> 59:12.549
Are my parents alive?

59:12.592 --> 59:16.857
[clanging sounds]

59:16.901 --> 59:23.429
[mumbles]

59:23.472 --> 59:25.126
What is it?

59:25.170 --> 59:26.475
Yes or no?

59:26.519 --> 59:27.215
It's a yes.

59:27.259 --> 59:28.129
No.

59:28.173 --> 59:29.043
It's a yes.

59:29.087 --> 59:30.044
Stop.

59:30.088 --> 59:32.873
You're wasting your time.

59:32.917 --> 59:37.443
It's only a game
and no more than that.

59:37.486 --> 59:45.146
Life's great decisions
cannot be left to a machine.

59:45.190 --> 59:47.584
So, what about this?

59:49.629 --> 59:54.591
To understand we must know
the past.

59:54.634 --> 59:57.594
To comprehend the past

59:57.637 --> 01:00:00.640
we must go to the museum.

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:07.255
Who goes there?

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:08.605
I'm calling the police.

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.085
Oh, do calm down Zylmar.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.653
It's only me Nicholas.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:18.658
It's after midnight,
so you must be Ivan.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:22.662
My name is Zylmar Canobias.

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.969
I am the curator
of this museum

01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:27.667
and also the security guard.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:33.281
This puzzle was made by your
great-grandfather, Blaze Drago.

01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:35.675
Here we have the Rubic River

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:39.331
which marks the southern
boundary of the city.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:43.770
Up to the north the abandoned
labyrinth.

01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:49.689
There is the magic brain
and here is the museum.

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.692
And the missing piece?

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:57.044
I'll leave that one to Nicholas.

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:03.485
It was Morodian.

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:08.316
That piece had a picture
of his house on it.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.883
When he stole it

01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:14.366
it was as if he'd taken
the soul of the city.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:20.502
What use is a jigsaw puzzle
with a missing piece?

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.504
Morodian lived in Zyl?

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:28.685
Morodian's parents own a missing
chess pieces store.

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:32.819
His mother ran off
with a traveling salesman.

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:36.214
His father, poor soul,
decided one night

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:40.348
to go looking for her.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.699
Through the labyrinth.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:47.747
[thunder and lightning]

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:52.926
That night Morodian
became an orphan

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.841
so I took him in.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:57.714
You raised Morodian?

01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:00.194
Your father and Morodian
were almost the same age,

01:02:00.238 --> 01:02:02.414
they grew up together.

01:02:02.457 --> 01:02:06.940
Your father never shared
our passion for games.

01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:11.379
But Morodian,

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:14.295
he became my apprentice.

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.471
But as the years went by

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:20.084
something seemed
to sour within him.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:24.479
His games became darker,
more sinister.

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:28.962
He said that they were
from his deepest nightmares.

01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:32.052
Soon thereafter he submitted
his entry

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:35.577
into the young
inventors tournament.

01:02:35.621 --> 01:02:37.928
His entry was called
the Labyrinth of Death

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:41.758
based on his fathers
terrible demise.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:45.805
Zyl was not ready to accept
someone so different

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:52.203
so Morodian at the age of 20
was banished from the town.

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:58.296
He blamed me.

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:01.299
Was it your decision?

01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:06.347
No one was willing to take
responsibility.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:14.442
So we finally decided to take
it to the magic brain.

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:17.968
The brain replied yes.

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:23.930
Morodian felt that I had
betrayed him

01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:26.715
and he left that same night

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:31.372
committing one last
act of defiance.

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:33.853
He left a letter.

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:36.464
He attacked me

01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:40.555
for abandoning him to the
whim of an old machine

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:44.168
and said he wished I had
never taken him in.

01:03:44.211 --> 01:03:48.520
He finished the letter
with a terrible curse.

01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:53.830
The dynasty of Drago inventors

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:57.355
will end with you, Nicholas.

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:09.976
Your father left town
shortly after to begin his life.

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.849
And you never heard
from him again?

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:20.334
Not until his call informing me
of your existence.

01:04:20.378 --> 01:04:26.993
But now I realize it was his
choice to keep you a secret.

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:31.563
But Morodian got what he
wanted and was able to find me.

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:33.173
But now, now, now.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:36.046
He actually didn't get
what he wanted.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:39.179
You want to be a games maker,
a great inventor,

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:43.923
you're living here with your
grandpa in the right place.

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.404
Forget Morodian.

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:49.537
I can't ignore Morodian, he's
been making me play this game

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:52.932
without explaining the rules
and I think he's the only one

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.934
who knows what
happened to my parents.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:56.544
Sorry grandpa.

01:04:56.588 --> 01:04:59.373
But don't you understand?

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:02.550
That's exactly what
he wants.

01:05:02.594 --> 01:05:04.552
Please, Ivan.

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:07.033
Don't make me lose you
as well.

01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:09.209
I have to find out what
happened to my parents

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:11.385
and the only way to do that is
to face Morodian.

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:12.734
No, Ivan.

01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:13.735
Don't Ivan!

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.041
Please!

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.216
It's a trap!

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.610
Don't do this!

01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:21.613
Zylmar! Zylmar!

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.271
[panting]

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:29.028
[train bustling through]

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.160
[panting]

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:31.900
Ugh!!

01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:35.992
[coughs]

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:56.229
[Grandpa's voice]: The keys
to success are confidence
and concentration.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.053
[knocking]

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:42.884
Company.

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:46.932
Company this is Mobile 1,
over.

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:50.109
This is Company,
what have you to report?

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.676
Over.

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:54.896
Taking passenger, repeat,
the passenger to The Company.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:55.723
Over.

01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:57.073
Sir?

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:01.120
Sir?

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.818
Could you please
tell Morodian that I -

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:34.631
The Profound Games Company
Headquarters, Terminus.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.618
I want to see Morodian.

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:05.662
Name.

01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:07.665
Ivan Drago.

01:09:28.773 --> 01:09:33.037
Take the elevator to
the top floor and wait.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:36.433
Ivan Drago is entering
the Profound Games Company.

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:50.185
[elevator ding]

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.448
Oh, you're here,

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:55.495
sorry I was supposed to meet you
at the door.

01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:56.670
I'm Ivan.

01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:57.671
I'm Ivan.

01:09:57.715 --> 01:09:58.933
I know, I know.

01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:01.675
I'm not really Ivan,
I'm a professional Ivan.

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:02.546
A fake Ivan?

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:03.286
No, no.

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:04.243
Not fake, professional.

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:07.420
This is my job.

01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.509
You know, I had a feeling
you'd be arriving any day

01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:11.424
because they didn't seem
that bothered with me anymore

01:10:11.468 --> 01:10:12.860
and I had begun to suspect that

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:14.775
they were going to replace me
with the real thing.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.089
I want to see Morodian now.

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:25.699
Morodian?

01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:27.223
I don't think you will be able
to see him now,

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:30.617
he's probably still dreaming.

01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:32.402
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:41.237
We have to wait because
when the red light is on

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.978
it means Mr. Profoundus
is dreaming.

01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:46.938
Interrupting him
will be unforgivable.

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.898
What are those?

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.597
panmonitors, Mr. Profoundus's
bodyguards.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.122
They have 360 degree control,
brilliant isn't it?

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:02.083
Who's that?

01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:03.084
A dream scribe.

01:11:03.128 --> 01:11:04.521
Dream scribes are responsible

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:06.392
for noting and interpreting
Mr. Profoundus's words,

01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:08.089
based on what he says
to make his dreams

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:12.006
wonderful new games are created.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.312
Mr. Profoundus?

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:15.619
Yes, that's how Morodian
wishes to be addressed.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:17.751
Anyway, as I was saying at
the beginning of the world

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.492
obsessed by my acting.

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.320
Watch, your tenth birthday.

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:25.846
Shwoop! Shwoop!!!

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:29.154
And how about this,
organizing the treasure hunt.

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:32.026
This is not just any game,

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.855
this is one of the oldest games
in history.

01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:36.422
How do I sound?

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:39.120
I've got a five year contract
to play you in other shows,

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:41.688
five years.

01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:43.124
Shows?

01:11:43.168 --> 01:11:44.778
Yeah. The life of Ivan Drago.

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:48.304
It's by far the best attraction
in the whole of Profound Park.

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:56.486
This one is Ramuz,
the chief scribe.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:34.698
Mr. Profoundus, the real Ivan
has arrived.

01:12:40.225 --> 01:12:42.880
Are you Ivan?

01:12:56.894 --> 01:13:01.377
Welcome.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:06.251
Ivan.

01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:09.036
You must be very happy.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.211
Happy?

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:13.389
Why would I be happy?

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:14.955
Excited.

01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:17.567
Grateful.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.959
Overwhelmed.

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:20.874
No.

01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:22.398
Why should I be?

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:25.096
Why?

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:31.058
Why? Because you are in the
true mecca of games invention,

01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:32.930
it wasn't easy getting
you here.

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:34.235
In fact it took years,

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:37.282
I had to intervene repeatedly
in your life.

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:38.588
Intervene?

01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.328
What gave you the right
to do that?

01:13:40.372 --> 01:13:42.766
I want to know the truth
about my parents accident.

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:44.289
I must confess
I'm rather surprised

01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:46.770
to find you so ungrateful,

01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:50.251
especially considering
the fact that Profound Parks

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:56.475
main attraction will be a game
bearing your name.

01:13:56.519 --> 01:14:01.437
Only a few more days now,
hours.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.875
The big opening is nearly
upon us.

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.314
Oh, but where are
my manners?

01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:10.576
We need to get him settled in.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.273
We need to get you settled in.

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:15.625
Come, let me show you
the factory.

01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:18.279
The engineers room

01:14:18.323 --> 01:14:21.457
where my ideas are transformed
into games,

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.809
come and meet Lazarus
one of our chief engineers.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:28.638
Ivan Drago.

01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:30.596
Don't bother talking to him,
he's deaf.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.470
Lost his hearing working
on a dynamite game.

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:38.125
Dynamite games about to go
on sale to the general public,

01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:39.605
sure to be a big hit.

01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:42.521
An explosive success.

01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:44.131
But, once you've detonated it.

01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:45.481
Yes, you have to buy another.

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:49.702
You learn fast.

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:52.400
Poor thing, can't keep
them awake.

01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:56.187
Yes, here at the company
we consider work and leisure

01:14:56.230 --> 01:15:01.148
to be rather old fashioned
concepts.

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:02.672
Death Trap?

01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:05.805
I know this game, they
used to play it at Possum.

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:07.633
I never really got it, as far as
I could see

01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:10.984
the player who has more cards
always had an advantage.

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:12.899
Correct, the player
who has purchased

01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:14.988
the greater number
of cards has--

01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.555
A greater chance of winning,
yes.

01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:18.165
I find that traditional games

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.907
give children such an
unrealistic idea of life.

01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:23.649
Equal opportunity,
level playing ground,

01:15:23.693 --> 01:15:25.172
all those ridiculous myths.

01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:26.870
This game teaches children
the truth,

01:15:26.913 --> 01:15:29.655
those with the greater means
at their disposal

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:31.352
have a greater chance
of success.

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:33.180
Now, the companies
best selling games

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:37.358
are the ones that spring
directly from my dreams.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:40.536
They belong to
the nightmare series.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:41.885
Nightmare?

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.669
My grandpa said that
when you were in Zyl.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:46.672
Silence!

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:47.978
Company rule number one,

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:50.197
it's forbidden to utter
the name of that place.

01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:53.200
Oh, this is rather interesting.

01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:55.202
Now, anything that's no longer
of use to us is sent

01:15:55.246 --> 01:15:57.857
into the games garbage
and there's so much of it.

01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.685
You see, all of our games
are designed to be obsolete

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:01.382
within six months of purchase,

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.210
it means the customer
always has something new

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:05.038
to look forward to.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:06.605
Do people work down there?

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.433
Like I said anything
that's no longer of use to us

01:16:08.476 --> 01:16:10.566
is sent down there.

01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:13.612
Garbage men don't usually last
that long but Gabbler,

01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:15.571
he's survived
for quite some time.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:16.572
Who?

01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.182
Gabler.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:22.055
Exceptional engineer but his
heart just wasn't in the job,

01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:24.754
I had to find a new role for him
in the company.

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:29.585
Possum?

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:30.716
Principal Possum?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.196
What's the matter?
You seen a ghost?

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:35.112
Hurry along now, your
induction starts in two minutes.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:41.597
It will be a true inspiration
to my workers

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.951
seeing the last hope of that
decadent city installed here

01:16:47.994 --> 01:16:51.084
at the Profound Games Company.

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:56.089
Your arrival will guarantee
that Ivan Drago's life

01:16:56.133 --> 01:17:02.008
becomes the parks
greatest attraction.

01:17:02.052 --> 01:17:07.927
And it will also prove that life
is indeed a game.

01:17:07.971 --> 01:17:11.104
Ivan's childhood.

01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:15.195
Spent with his doting parents.

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:19.330
Until their unfortunate
hot air balloon accident.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:22.289
Next, Ivan's brief sojourn
at Possum

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:26.380
and the dramatic sinking
of the school

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:34.954
and then came Ivan to
the capital of decay.

01:17:34.998 --> 01:17:40.133
But we would never leave our
customers without a grand finale

01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:45.704
and so Ivan Drago
like so many others before him

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:51.971
joining the Profound
Games Company.

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.017
Listen, Morodian.

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:57.150
Mr. Profoundus, whatever
you want to call yourself.

01:17:57.194 --> 01:18:00.066
My life isn't a game,

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:03.591
that balloon out there,
it's not a toy.

01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:05.332
My parents were on board

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:08.509
and I want to know what you've
done with them.

01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:12.339
It's late and you've had
a long journey.

01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:13.166
I'll tell you what,

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.691
go to bed get some rest

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:17.605
tomorrow you'll start
working for the company.

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:18.824
No.

01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:20.696
I don't want to sleep,
I want the truth.

01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:24.395
Ahh! Ah! Ah!!!

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:29.226
Ivan needs to rest,
you must sleep.

01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:36.233
So tomorrow he can begin his
new life in our great company.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:13.792
...Thank you for your visit, please exit out the front door.

01:19:13.836 --> 01:19:16.403
Welcome to the home
of Ivan Drago,

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:18.405
we at Profound Park
remind you not to touch

01:19:18.449 --> 01:19:20.233
any of the displays.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:24.281
You are walking inside an exact replica of Ivan's childhood home

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:25.891
where he lived in the years

01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.980
before the tragic accident
that befell his parents

01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:31.114
the day their balloon drifted
into the high mountain peaks,

01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:33.420
never to be seen again.

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:35.422
After two weeks of
tireless searching

01:19:35.466 --> 01:19:38.948
authorities confirmed there
were no survivors.

01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:42.299
An only child and without any living relatives...

01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:46.129
[panting]

01:19:49.132 --> 01:19:57.488
[panting]

01:20:02.972 --> 01:20:05.104
Mom!!!

01:20:05.148 --> 01:20:07.150
Dad!!!

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:18.117
An excellent replica.

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:19.640
Don't you think?

01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:22.948
Really quite remarkable.

01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:24.297
Well, come on.

01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:27.126
Up you get Ivan.
Give me your hand.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.954
There we go.

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:30.956
It's time to see
where you'll be working.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.958
Come.

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:36.048
I'm very excited for you to see
your office, Ivan.

01:20:36.092 --> 01:20:39.312
Where people will watch
you working inventing games,

01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:41.967
signing autographs,

01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:45.144
oh strictly one per person
of course.

01:20:45.188 --> 01:20:47.973
And here we are.

01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:49.148
Well, jump down,
have a look.

01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:51.194
Tell me what you think.

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:58.070
I don't like it.

01:20:58.114 --> 01:20:59.724
Really?

01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:01.508
You don't think seeing Nicholas
Drago's grandson working for me

01:21:01.552 --> 01:21:02.858
is an amazing ending?

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.598
Come on.

01:21:04.642 --> 01:21:07.210
Maybe for you.

01:21:07.253 --> 01:21:12.345
Not for me, and for the visitors
I don't think so.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.173
Oh, you may have a point.

01:21:14.217 --> 01:21:17.046
Perhaps I need to look deeper
into my dreams

01:21:17.089 --> 01:21:20.876
to find the perfect ending
to Ivan Drago's life.

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:23.574
Don't I have a say?

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:26.011
Well, we could work together.

01:21:26.055 --> 01:21:28.231
Two great inventors
joining forces

01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:30.886
to create the ultimate game.

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:32.191
Yes, I dream, you write.

01:21:32.235 --> 01:21:33.714
It's been decided.

01:21:33.758 --> 01:21:35.107
Remus will show you
what to do.

01:21:35.151 --> 01:21:37.370
Forget it, I'll never be
your dream scribe.

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.285
I'm going back to Zyl
as soon as you tell me

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:41.548
all you know about
my parents accident,

01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.724
and give back that puzzle
piece you stole.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:47.032
Have it your way, Ivan.

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:50.209
You're free to leave
whenever you want,

01:21:50.253 --> 01:21:53.734
but there is one last thing
you really should see

01:21:53.778 --> 01:21:55.301
before you go.

01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:59.262
Who knows, it might just
help you change your mind.

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:05.921
You know something Ivan,
you and I we possess a gift

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:08.924
that these fools
can only dream of.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.839
The ability to create
amazing games.

01:22:11.883 --> 01:22:13.667
I'm nothing like you,
Morodian.

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:16.757
For you games
are dark and brutal.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:19.151
But of course they are.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:22.981
Did granddaddy
teach you nothing?

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:24.940
You're young.

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:31.337
In time you'll understand life
is the most brutal game of all

01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:35.994
and when the time comes
to crush your opponent Ivan

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:40.433
you must show no mercy.

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:43.959
Winner takes all.

01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:45.961
Sorry, but you're wrong
Morodian.

01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:47.484
I'll never join you.

01:22:47.527 --> 01:22:51.096
Really, I can't tempt you?

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.969
You must be hungry you haven't
had any breakfast.

01:22:54.012 --> 01:22:57.798
Oh, very well.

01:22:57.842 --> 01:23:00.105
Just like mama used to make.

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:02.847
Oh, by the way,

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:06.285
behind you this is going to be
a really big draw,

01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:09.462
we've just got a few teething
problems.

01:23:09.506 --> 01:23:12.291
Krebs!

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:17.905
Krebs, you idiot, I said above
the water not in the water.

01:23:19.429 --> 01:23:20.821
Hey, Drago!

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:22.736
Not the sharpest tool in
the box your classmate

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.869
but very loyal.

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:32.355
And here we are, a little girl
with the extraordinary talent,

01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:34.835
she can camouflage herself
against any background.

01:23:34.879 --> 01:23:36.315
Anunciacion.

01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:38.404
Poor thing, you know the
three of us have much in common.

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:40.754
Well, I'm glad to see
you're resigned to stay.

01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:43.757
Get settled in you'll be
my dream scribe tonight,

01:23:43.801 --> 01:23:47.892
my chamber 3:00 am,
don't be late.

01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:09.044
If you put a watch close to
his ear he dreams of his father.

01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:13.048
The sound of a silver spoon
in a glass of water

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:16.181
and he dreams of ships.

01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:18.531
You must write down
every single word

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:22.057
that Mr. Profoundus utters.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.887
Take this.

01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:33.285
His most vivid dreams occur
during the hours before dawn,

01:24:33.329 --> 01:24:38.595
you will meet me
at 3:00 am do not be late.

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:58.093
Mr. Drago, can I have
an autograph?

01:24:58.136 --> 01:25:00.225
Mr. Drago!

01:25:00.269 --> 01:25:02.923
Hey! Mr. Drago!

01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:04.490
Can I just say what
an honour it is

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:07.493
to have been
chosen to play you.

01:25:07.537 --> 01:25:09.408
An honour.

01:25:09.452 --> 01:25:14.283
Look, this is what they gave me
when I was hired.

01:25:14.326 --> 01:25:19.418
Ivan Drago is resourceful,
brave and determined.

01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:20.767
I'm nothing.

01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:22.160
Nothing?

01:25:22.204 --> 01:25:23.988
You're a legend.

01:25:24.031 --> 01:25:27.861
Come on, take a look.

01:25:46.315 --> 01:25:49.318
Brave and determined?

01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:50.623
That's a joke.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:52.321
But of course you are,

01:25:52.364 --> 01:25:54.975
you won a competition
that lasted more than a year,

01:25:55.019 --> 01:25:56.629
you sunk a school.

01:25:56.673 --> 01:25:58.196
I could never have done
those things.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.112
You, Ivan, you're a hero.

01:26:06.204 --> 01:26:09.294
You know, I was thinking,

01:26:09.338 --> 01:26:12.645
shouldn't we prepare
before the park opens?

01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:17.520
Oh yes, I'm a bag of nerves
just thinking about it.

01:26:17.563 --> 01:26:20.697
Which is why I want
to help you rehearse.

01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:38.193
Don't open the door to anyone
until I get back.

01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:52.745
[electric sparks]

01:27:52.789 --> 01:27:55.008
Mr. Gabler?

01:27:55.052 --> 01:27:57.924
[electric sparks]

01:27:57.968 --> 01:27:59.578
Gabler?

01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:06.019
[electric sparks]

01:28:06.063 --> 01:28:08.326
Mr. Gabler?

01:28:13.984 --> 01:28:17.117
Ivan Drago!

01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:20.512
The real Ivan Drago in person.

01:28:20.556 --> 01:28:23.776
Yes. It's me.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.952
What are you doing here?

01:28:25.996 --> 01:28:29.652
I came to ask
about my parents.

01:28:29.695 --> 01:28:35.353
You won't find them
in the garbage,

01:28:35.397 --> 01:28:40.619
but if you're asking if Morodian
was responsible

01:28:40.663 --> 01:28:43.796
for the balloon accident

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:52.152
the only person who can answer
that is Morodian himself.

01:28:52.196 --> 01:28:55.242
If you're trapped down here

01:28:55.286 --> 01:29:00.639
how do you know about
the balloon and my parents?

01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:05.818
There's something
you should see.

01:29:05.862 --> 01:29:09.779
This room is dedicated
to your life.

01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:27.840
Why?

01:29:27.884 --> 01:29:31.104
When he discovered who you were

01:29:31.148 --> 01:29:34.369
and was able to see your talent

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:40.375
well he put all his energy
and resources

01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:43.595
into fulfilling his curse.

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:47.425
His aim was to separate you
from your family

01:29:47.469 --> 01:29:52.212
and luring you here will be
the final nail in Zyl's coffin.

01:29:52.256 --> 01:29:54.476
A double victory.

01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:17.934
Did she read this?

01:30:20.197 --> 01:30:23.461
Apparently so.

01:30:25.115 --> 01:30:27.247
Escape.

01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:29.598
Look at me.

01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:35.995
I too came here thinking
I could stop this monster.

01:30:36.039 --> 01:30:39.303
No, I can't just run away.

01:30:39.346 --> 01:30:42.480
Morodian kidnapped my friend
Annunciacion.

01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:45.265
He showed me her theatre.

01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:48.791
Have you seen her?

01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:54.144
Could be a trap,
be careful.

01:30:58.801 --> 01:31:03.109
I don't have much time,
how do I get back up top?

01:31:03.153 --> 01:31:07.505
With a little help
from our old friend.

01:31:07.549 --> 01:31:10.334
Victor Jade.

01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:23.129
These were all printed to
bring you into the company.

01:31:23.173 --> 01:31:32.661
Now perhaps they'll help you
get out of here.

01:31:45.456 --> 01:31:49.242
If you know the way out
why don't you go up top?

01:31:49.286 --> 01:31:54.596
If I ever leave here it will be
to go back to Zyl.

01:32:04.562 --> 01:32:06.999
Tyrelas, we have to get
Shark Pit ready.

01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:09.524
Yes sir.

01:32:42.295 --> 01:32:45.124
Anunciacion!

01:32:45.168 --> 01:32:48.737
Anunciacion!

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.782
How did you find me?

01:32:50.826 --> 01:32:53.045
Morodian showed me your theatre,
he's a monster.

01:32:53.089 --> 01:32:55.570
I'm sure he had something to do
with my parents accident.

01:32:55.613 --> 01:32:57.223
I'm hoping they're here.

01:32:57.267 --> 01:32:59.617
I haven't heard anything since
they kidnapped me two days ago,

01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:03.055
Morodian's been making me
rehearse day and night.

01:33:03.099 --> 01:33:06.406
I have to go, he wants me
to be his dream scribe

01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:07.799
but I'll come back for you.

01:33:07.843 --> 01:33:09.061
I promise.

01:33:09.105 --> 01:33:10.715
Don't come back here,
it's too dangerous.

01:33:10.759 --> 01:33:12.717
Lets meet in my theatre.

01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:14.414
panmonitors will come
take me to rehearse soon,

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.155
but don't worry about it.

01:33:16.199 --> 01:33:18.636
Considering they have three
brains they're pretty stupid.

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:22.597
Making myself invisible
is kind of my specialty.

01:33:25.774 --> 01:33:28.124
We'll find a way out of here.

01:33:31.127 --> 01:33:33.259
You're late.

01:33:33.303 --> 01:33:35.174
Be careful not to wake him.

01:33:35.218 --> 01:33:38.961
You wouldn't want to suffer
the wrath of Mr. Profoundus.

01:33:45.054 --> 01:33:49.058
[heavy breathing]

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.772
[Sleep talking]: Yes father,
yes father I'm coming.

01:34:07.816 --> 01:34:09.774
I'm coming.

01:34:09.818 --> 01:34:11.036
Where are my--

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.474
No questions,
I'm tired.

01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:17.695
So tired.

01:34:17.739 --> 01:34:20.480
Where are Ivan Drago's parents?

01:34:20.524 --> 01:34:23.832
What parents?

01:34:23.875 --> 01:34:26.661
Ivan Drago is an orphan.

01:34:36.192 --> 01:34:37.976
I didn't mean to hurt them.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.022
I didn't want to.

01:34:40.065 --> 01:34:43.503
What did you want?

01:34:43.547 --> 01:34:46.332
To keep them away.

01:34:46.376 --> 01:34:50.815
So Ivan would join the company
but the wind, the wind

01:34:50.859 --> 01:34:54.819
took them to the mountains
within seconds,

01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:57.517
they're frozen solid.

01:34:57.561 --> 01:35:00.695
Frozen solid.

01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:05.830
We sent an expedition
in search of them,

01:35:05.874 --> 01:35:10.574
all they brought back was
a bag.

01:35:50.614 --> 01:35:56.141
[alarm wailing]

01:35:56.185 --> 01:35:59.101
Do you really think
I'm that stupid?

01:35:59.144 --> 01:36:00.580
[alarm wailing]

01:36:00.624 --> 01:36:03.322
Mr. Profoundus, is
everything alright?

01:36:03.366 --> 01:36:04.497
Where's the boy?

01:36:04.541 --> 01:36:06.804
Deactivate the alarm!

01:36:06.848 --> 01:36:08.414
Yes sir, immediately.

01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:15.117
Make a note,
loyalty test failed.

01:36:26.824 --> 01:36:31.220
Tell the panmonitors to fetch
Mr. and Mrs. Drago.

01:36:39.141 --> 01:36:40.316
Anunciacion.

01:36:42.971 --> 01:36:44.799
Anunciacion!

01:36:44.842 --> 01:36:46.931
Ivan, over here!

01:36:46.975 --> 01:36:48.977
In Mamma's Cakes!

01:36:52.894 --> 01:36:54.678
Come on, we've got to get
out of the park!

01:36:54.721 --> 01:36:55.853
What about your parents?

01:36:55.897 --> 01:36:57.376
No, my parents are.

01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.595
No, Ivan.

01:36:58.638 --> 01:36:59.683
There's a man and a woman,
I just saw them.

01:36:59.726 --> 01:37:01.337
They look exactly
like your photo.

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.556
They were taken by
the panmonitors.

01:37:06.342 --> 01:37:10.825
Smell those cakes, my mother
was just here I'm sure.

01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:13.305
I'd know that smell anywhere.

01:37:13.349 --> 01:37:14.829
Still hot.

01:37:14.872 --> 01:37:16.526
They must have
just taken them!

01:37:27.406 --> 01:37:28.320
Oohh!!!

01:37:28.364 --> 01:37:29.582
UGH!!!!!

01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:32.716
My parents,
have you seen them?

01:37:32.759 --> 01:37:35.501
Oh, you mean that was the real
Mr. And Mrs. Drago?

01:37:35.545 --> 01:37:36.502
Amazing.

01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:37.808
Where were they taking them?

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.854
Oh, this tunnel leads
to the shark bait tank.

01:37:39.897 --> 01:37:41.551
Oh no, Krebs!

01:37:44.467 --> 01:37:45.250
Who are you?

01:37:45.294 --> 01:37:46.425
Why are you following us?

01:37:46.469 --> 01:37:47.557
He's the fake Ivan!

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.688
Not fake!

01:37:48.732 --> 01:37:50.212
Professional!

01:37:54.912 --> 01:37:56.392
Ivan!

01:37:58.568 --> 01:37:59.569
No!

01:38:03.616 --> 01:38:04.574
No!

01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:11.189
Help us!

01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:15.890
Ahhhhh!!!!!!

01:38:15.933 --> 01:38:17.979
Hang on honey, it's okay,
it's okay.

01:38:19.415 --> 01:38:21.417
No! Please!

01:38:22.766 --> 01:38:25.247
Stop!

01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:26.857
Someone help us!

01:38:30.078 --> 01:38:31.253
No!

01:38:31.296 --> 01:38:34.604
Anunciacion, distract
the panmonitors.

01:38:36.954 --> 01:38:38.086
Stop copying me!

01:38:38.129 --> 01:38:39.043
Sorry.

01:38:39.087 --> 01:38:40.044
You go that way.

01:38:40.088 --> 01:38:41.611
Okay, fine.

01:38:43.265 --> 01:38:44.396
You're crazy!

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.745
Ah!!

01:38:45.789 --> 01:38:49.053
Hey guys, I'm over here,
come get me.

01:38:49.097 --> 01:38:50.794
Oh my.

01:38:51.969 --> 01:38:53.753
No!

01:38:53.797 --> 01:38:55.103
Ivan! Ivan!

01:38:55.146 --> 01:38:56.408
Don't worry, I'll get you
out of there!

01:38:56.452 --> 01:38:57.583
Son!

01:38:57.627 --> 01:38:58.845
Put them down, Krebs.

01:38:58.889 --> 01:38:59.759
Okay, have it your way.

01:38:59.803 --> 01:39:00.935
No, no.

01:39:00.978 --> 01:39:03.154
Ahhhh!! Ahhhh!!!!!!

01:39:03.198 --> 01:39:04.460
Hang on, hang on honey.

01:39:04.503 --> 01:39:05.852
Get off me, Drago.

01:39:05.896 --> 01:39:07.419
No!

01:39:07.463 --> 01:39:08.943
Ivan, watch out!

01:39:08.986 --> 01:39:12.424
[fighting grunts]

01:39:12.468 --> 01:39:13.773
Ivan, are you alright?

01:39:13.817 --> 01:39:14.992
Stand by, Drago.

01:39:15.036 --> 01:39:17.342
Now lets see if your parents
can swim.

01:39:17.386 --> 01:39:19.388
Pick on someone
your own size.

01:39:21.303 --> 01:39:22.434
How does this work?

01:39:22.478 --> 01:39:23.261
Up, up!

01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:24.741
Put it up!

01:39:30.834 --> 01:39:32.140
No, not that one,
the other one!

01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:33.619
Mom, dad!

01:39:33.663 --> 01:39:35.273
Ivan!

01:39:35.317 --> 01:39:36.622
What the--

01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:38.494
Ivan, are you okay?

01:39:41.497 --> 01:39:42.715
Ivan, watch out!

01:39:44.935 --> 01:39:46.806
Put it up!

01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:47.807
Be careful!

01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.374
Anunciacion!

01:39:49.418 --> 01:39:51.028
Keep the cage swinging!

01:39:51.072 --> 01:39:51.986
Are you sure, Ivan?

01:39:52.029 --> 01:39:52.899
Don't worry, Dad.

01:39:52.943 --> 01:39:53.683
I know what I'm doing.

01:39:53.726 --> 01:39:55.337
Okay.

01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:04.128
[shrill scream]
Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!

01:40:04.172 --> 01:40:04.999
Yes!

01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:07.001
Well done, Ivan!

01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:08.524
Yes!

01:40:12.702 --> 01:40:14.747
Ramuz.

01:40:15.966 --> 01:40:16.880
Sir?

01:40:16.923 --> 01:40:18.490
We missed you so much.

01:40:18.534 --> 01:40:20.710
This is Anunciacion,
my invisible friend.

01:40:20.753 --> 01:40:21.319
How are you doing?

01:40:21.363 --> 01:40:22.538
Hi.

01:40:22.581 --> 01:40:23.408
Come on! We've got
to get out of here fast!

01:40:23.452 --> 01:40:24.148
The balloon!

01:40:24.192 --> 01:40:25.019
The balloon.

01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:25.932
Yeah.

01:40:25.976 --> 01:40:27.891
Thank you for everything Ivan.

01:40:27.934 --> 01:40:31.155
I don't know who you are,
but thank you.

01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.069
Lets go.

01:40:32.113 --> 01:40:33.636
It was nothing, dad.

01:40:35.072 --> 01:40:36.030
Dad?

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:40.512
Send every panmonitor
to the balloon.

01:40:40.556 --> 01:40:41.513
Now!

01:40:41.557 --> 01:40:42.688
Come on, hurry!

01:40:42.732 --> 01:40:43.863
Other rope Ivan.

01:40:43.907 --> 01:40:44.516
Okay, this ones cut.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.343
Get the rope.

01:40:45.387 --> 01:40:46.910
Hang on everybody.

01:40:50.131 --> 01:40:51.045
Okay.

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:52.872
Honey, get the ballast.

01:40:52.916 --> 01:40:53.699
We're ready for takeoff.

01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:54.874
Okay, igniting burners.

01:40:54.918 --> 01:40:55.788
Honey.

01:40:55.832 --> 01:40:56.528
Ivan!

01:40:56.572 --> 01:40:57.225
Ivan, come back here!

01:40:57.268 --> 01:40:58.530
Ivan!

01:40:58.574 --> 01:40:59.531
Son!

01:40:59.575 --> 01:41:01.055
Ivan, look out!

01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:03.361
Run, Ivan!

01:41:03.405 --> 01:41:04.232
No!

01:41:04.275 --> 01:41:05.189
Ivan, look out!

01:41:05.233 --> 01:41:06.756
Ivan, come back here!

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.324
Ivan! Run!

01:41:29.605 --> 01:41:35.219
So, I create all this
in your honour

01:41:35.263 --> 01:41:37.961
and you repay me
with betrayal.

01:41:38.004 --> 01:41:45.751
I dream up the perfect ending
and you refuse to play along.

01:41:45.795 --> 01:41:48.319
And look at you now, Ivan.

01:41:48.363 --> 01:41:53.107
Back where our game began.

01:41:54.673 --> 01:41:56.458
You're surrounded,
you cannot win.

01:42:00.636 --> 01:42:02.420
[Grandpa's voice]:
By never giving up hope

01:42:02.464 --> 01:42:05.684
even when faced
with many opponents.

01:42:07.991 --> 01:42:10.515
Say goodbye to your parents,
Ivan.

01:42:10.559 --> 01:42:12.474
I've no use for them now,

01:42:12.517 --> 01:42:18.262
but I'm afraid you and the
jigsaw piece are staying here.

01:42:18.306 --> 01:42:21.874
Oh no, Ivan.

01:42:21.918 --> 01:42:25.487
Ivan, don't be ridiculous.

01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:29.012
We know your life story here.

01:42:29.055 --> 01:42:32.494
Everyone knows
you're a hopeless shot.

01:42:34.844 --> 01:42:37.368
Mom, dad, duck!

01:42:45.333 --> 01:42:46.769
Bravo.

01:42:46.812 --> 01:42:48.205
This is the end of your curse
on my family, Morodian.

01:42:48.249 --> 01:42:52.818
But it's just a tiny piece
of cardboard.

01:42:52.862 --> 01:42:57.823
What matters is the last of the
Drago's remains here with me,

01:42:57.867 --> 01:42:59.738
that's the fulfillment
of my curse.

01:42:59.782 --> 01:43:01.305
No Morodian, no.

01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:04.308
As of today the curse
is lifted.

01:43:04.352 --> 01:43:07.833
Oh please, you've never played
a game in your entire life.

01:43:07.877 --> 01:43:10.836
I wouldn't trust you to move
a single playing piece.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.186
Maybe not,

01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:14.231
but I can move in real life.

01:43:22.065 --> 01:43:24.546
Oh, you have my sympathies
Ivan.

01:43:28.071 --> 01:43:31.335
Not even a word goodbye.

01:43:31.379 --> 01:43:36.340
Oh well, here you are alone,
abandoned,

01:43:36.384 --> 01:43:40.039
orphaned for a second time.

01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:42.738
Just like me.

01:43:42.781 --> 01:43:47.221
Take him down to his office,
back to work,

01:43:47.264 --> 01:43:49.223
nothing has happened here.

01:43:49.266 --> 01:43:50.746
Ivan!

01:44:01.104 --> 01:44:02.801
Don't let the balloon advance,

01:44:02.845 --> 01:44:05.717
don't let the balloon advance!

01:44:05.761 --> 01:44:06.892
Gahhh!!!!!

01:44:06.936 --> 01:44:07.893
You idiots,
stop the balloon.

01:44:07.937 --> 01:44:10.113
Stop the balloon!

01:44:10.156 --> 01:44:11.723
Stop it!

01:44:11.767 --> 01:44:15.249
I won't let you get away
with this, Ivan!

01:44:18.469 --> 01:44:19.557
Ivan!

01:44:19.601 --> 01:44:21.864
Ivan! Ivan!

01:44:23.213 --> 01:44:24.301
You got it son, you got it.

01:44:24.345 --> 01:44:25.302
Ivan!

01:44:25.346 --> 01:44:26.912
[grunts]

01:44:26.956 --> 01:44:28.000
Take my hand!

01:44:28.044 --> 01:44:29.959
All this could have been
yours, boy.

01:44:30.002 --> 01:44:31.308
You've got it, one at a time.

01:44:31.352 --> 01:44:33.179
Ivan!

01:44:34.659 --> 01:44:36.313
You can do it!

01:44:36.357 --> 01:44:38.402
You think you can beat me!

01:44:38.446 --> 01:44:39.577
Huh?

01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:42.276
All this was yours Ivan!

01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:45.453
Yes!

01:44:48.804 --> 01:44:50.153
Mom!

01:45:09.085 --> 01:45:10.695
Comycan!

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:19.530
[explosion]

01:45:19.574 --> 01:45:24.883
[laughter]

01:45:40.508 --> 01:45:42.466
Those of you who have played
the game

01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:44.642
'The Life of Ivan Drago'

01:45:44.686 --> 01:45:48.864
will know that it is not made
by the Profound Games company

01:45:53.042 --> 01:45:56.741
and that it ends with Ivan's triumphant return to Zyl.

01:45:56.785 --> 01:45:59.004
Here come the Drago's!

01:45:59.048 --> 01:46:04.401
Celebrated in one of the most beautiful drawings on the board,

01:46:04.445 --> 01:46:09.885
but it says nothing about how he returns the stolen piece.

01:46:09.928 --> 01:46:12.714
Now that the jigsaw puzzle
was complete

01:46:12.757 --> 01:46:14.933
the tattoo on Ivan's hand

01:46:14.977 --> 01:46:18.284
was no longer a reminder
of what was missing

01:46:18.328 --> 01:46:21.549
but a symbol of what had
been achieved.

01:46:26.902 --> 01:46:28.512
And we'll never know

01:46:28.556 --> 01:46:30.601
if it was thanks to the return
of the jigsaw piece

01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:32.690
or because of the enormous
success of the game

01:46:32.734 --> 01:46:37.869
the life of Ivan Drago
and other games of course,

01:46:37.913 --> 01:46:43.222
what is certain is that Zyl
regained its prosperity

01:46:43.266 --> 01:46:46.400
and became the city
it once was.

01:46:49.315 --> 01:46:53.232
But the game only tells
one part of the story,

01:46:53.276 --> 01:46:57.236
while the fanatics carry on
playing beyond the last square

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.978
the purists say
that the real game

01:47:00.022 --> 01:47:02.720
is not the one with
the illustrated board

01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:08.117
but rather the first game that
Ivan devised for the contest,

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.989
the empty page that the players complete with drawings

01:47:11.033 --> 01:47:14.340
of their own dreams.

01:47:14.384 --> 01:47:19.476
They say the true game of
life is that blank page.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.958
Lets roll the dice again.
