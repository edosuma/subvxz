00:11.433 --> 00:13.700
SCOTT OVER RADIO:
The last one there has
to do the dishes for a week.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.400
ALAN OVER RADIO:
Well, you'd better
put on your rubber gloves now!

00:20.933 --> 00:23.567
You guys go for it.
I'm just glad to be home.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.433
ALAN: Hey, just because I dock
with old slowpoke here

00:36.500 --> 00:38.400
doesn't mean
I'm sharing dish duty.

00:47.967 --> 00:49.333
(LAUGHS) First!

00:51.800 --> 00:54.167
SCOTT: Thunderbird 1
coming in for landing.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.467
VIRGIL: Thunderbird 2
and 4 back to launch.

01:08.533 --> 01:12.067
And technically speaking,
my body entered
the hangar first.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.100
Well, looks like we have
our winner, Gordon.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.833
Ugh, dishes here I come.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.733
Better not be lasagna tonight!

01:25.967 --> 01:27.533
Ah, another mission complete.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.200
-(YAWNING) What a day.
-What a week!

01:31.267 --> 01:33.400
-But you guys did great.
-(GROANS)

01:33.467 --> 01:36.267
I know it's been a tough week
with missions back to back.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.100
-To back.
-To back.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.100
And now we can
all catch a break.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.300
(CALL BEEPING)

01:41.367 --> 01:43.800
Sorry, guys,
we have a situation.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.067
MAN: Five...

01:47.100 --> 01:49.067
Four...

01:49.100 --> 01:51.067
Three...

01:51.100 --> 01:53.633
Two...

01:53.700 --> 01:55.567
One.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.433
Thunderbirds are go!

02:39.367 --> 02:41.567
JOHN:
Destination Arctic Circle.

02:43.367 --> 02:47.200
Aurora Borealis,
the Northern Lights.

02:47.267 --> 02:50.700
The lights are created
by charged particles
in the high atmosphere.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.700
All that electricity
crackling in the air

02:52.767 --> 02:54.167
puts on quite a show.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.767
Now, this power station
was designed

02:55.833 --> 02:57.500
to harvest energy from it.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.667
It's called
the Aurora Generator.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.667
Let me guess.
Something went wrong?

03:01.733 --> 03:03.067
Give that Tracy a prize.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.300
The system was designed
to discharge excess energy.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.067
But that failsafe
has malfunctioned.

03:08.133 --> 03:10.733
We could be headed
for a massive
electrical explosion.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.667
-What's the current status?
-Approaching dangerous levels.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.433
-This is a recording
of the distress call.
-(BLEEP)

03:16.500 --> 03:18.833
I've done everything I can
to stabilize the system

03:18.900 --> 03:20.267
but nothing seems to work.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.333
We need immediate assistance.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.733
So, John, if you can
connect me with that engineer,

03:26.800 --> 03:28.433
I may be able to help.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.733
F-A-B.

03:30.833 --> 03:31.900
Hmm.

03:31.967 --> 03:34.567
I'd better adjust
your legs for traction.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.200
But you passed the crash test.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.400
Is this something
the GDF could handle instead?

03:42.467 --> 03:46.200
International Rescue
are the only ones equipped
and able to mobilize in time.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.067
-Understood.
-Well, you heard him.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.267
Mobilize.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.767
(SIGHS) Let's do this.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.700
Just tell me what you need.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.100
Scott and I
will take care of it.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.633
-We will?
-They stay here.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.067
Okay, Virgil.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.200
Well, we're here if you need
any cheeseburgers. (SNORES)

03:59.267 --> 04:02.233
Just the two of you?
The mission sounds pretty
unpredictable.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.500
Are you sure you don't need
back-up?

04:03.567 --> 04:04.967
I'll be going too.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.667
-You will?
-Oh, not in person.

04:07.733 --> 04:12.833
After rigorous testing,
I've reconfigured MAX
for Arctic conditions.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.133
(STUTTERS) He'll serve
as my eyes and ears
for this trip.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.067
Okay, MAX.
You're riding with me.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.533
(BEEPS)

04:19.600 --> 04:23.100
All right, then, looks like
Thunderbirds are go!

06:00.833 --> 06:03.067
MAN: Five, four,

06:03.067 --> 06:04.933
three, two,

06:05.067 --> 06:06.267
one.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.500
VIRGIL: Thunderbirds are go!

06:28.533 --> 06:30.300
SCOTT: Tell us
what we need to know, Brains.

06:30.367 --> 06:34.467
Your first m-mission will be
to go straight to the core
of the Aurora Generator

06:34.533 --> 06:38.200
and manually trigger
the release of the
excess energy.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.167
T-Time is of the essence.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.633
SCOTT: Coming in
for our final approach.

06:51.733 --> 06:54.100
I have eyes
on the Aurora Generator.

06:59.067 --> 07:02.633
Thunderbird 1 is experiencing
magnetic interference.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.067
(BEEPING)

07:04.067 --> 07:06.600
The same for Thunderbird 2.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.067
I think I can make
a forced landing

07:09.067 --> 07:11.200
without the guidance system.

07:11.267 --> 07:12.767
(GROANS) I can't get in close.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.633
The energy field
is too volatile.
Abort your landing.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.233
(STRAINS)

07:18.300 --> 07:21.300
VIRGIL:
We'll have to go around it.

07:21.367 --> 07:23.600
There's a safe landing area
beyond the ridge,

07:23.667 --> 07:26.233
500 aeronautical miles north
north-west.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.400
No, that'll take too long.
I can do this.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.800
(GROANS)

07:43.533 --> 07:44.967
VIRGIL:
This is our only option.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.567
We can travel back
to the generator by Pods.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.633
(WHIRRING)

08:31.133 --> 08:33.633
All right, Pod Explorer is go.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.933
The Pods are configured
for Arctic conditions,

08:41.067 --> 08:42.300
so we should get there safely.

08:42.367 --> 08:44.067
Great. Then let's blast it.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.467
Not so fast.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.367
We're surrounded
by ice hazards.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.267
I've plotted a route
that will skirt us around

08:49.333 --> 08:51.400
most of the more
treacherous landscape.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.300
We'll head just north
of this ice cliff.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.833
But the generator is south.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.067
The fastest route
between two points
is a straight line.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.300
(ENGINE REVVING)

09:01.633 --> 09:04.067
VIRGIL:
Scott, follow the route.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.733
It's too dangerous!

09:07.167 --> 09:09.367
(GROANS) Buckle up, MAX.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.067
We'll be fine. Trust me.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.067
(GRUNTS)

09:22.600 --> 09:23.767
(SIGHS)

09:27.900 --> 09:29.733
Can we do it my way now?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.533
Fine!

09:32.633 --> 09:34.500
-MAX...
-(BEEPS)

09:40.567 --> 09:42.967
Brains, is MAX okay out there?

09:43.067 --> 09:44.700
BRAINS:
Thanks for your concern

09:44.767 --> 09:46.933
but MAX can
withstand temperatures as low

09:47.067 --> 09:50.467
as minus 150 degrees Celsius.

09:50.533 --> 09:53.633
This is actually quite fun.
Whoo-hoo!

09:53.700 --> 09:54.633
You're enjoying it?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.067
I have modified MAX's
programming

09:57.067 --> 10:00.567
to allow me
the virtual experience
of feeling the surroundings.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.400
So whatever MAX sees,
you get to as well.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.667
Without the f-freezing
temperatures, of course.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.433
Well, we're happy
to have you both along
for the ride.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.067
My, how far you've come,
my friend.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.033
Can't this thing go
any faster?

10:32.100 --> 10:33.133
It sure can.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.533
Then why aren't we?

10:34.600 --> 10:38.033
-My Pod, my rules.
-(GROANS)

10:38.100 --> 10:39.800
Thunderbird 5 to Pod Explorer.

10:39.867 --> 10:43.167
Just got word, the situation
with the generator
is deteriorating.

10:43.233 --> 10:44.733
Brains, how much time
before it blows?

10:44.800 --> 10:47.467
There is such a flux
in the aurora activity

10:47.533 --> 10:50.467
that it's not p-possible
to pinpoint exactly

10:50.533 --> 10:52.867
how much energy
is being harvested.

10:52.933 --> 10:56.667
-JOHN: Best guess?
-Closest estimate
is six to 14 hours.

10:56.733 --> 10:58.800
You need to get there
as fast as possible.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.133
VIRGIL: We'll do our best.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.167
SCOTT: You can go faster
than that. Step on it.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.733
(ENGINE REVS)

11:07.767 --> 11:09.333
Now that's more like it!

11:30.633 --> 11:32.133
(MAX BEEPS)

11:37.900 --> 11:39.167
Why are you slowing down?

11:39.233 --> 11:41.267
I can barely make out
two feet in front of me.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.833
It's just a little ice fog.
We've been through worse.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.067
VIRGIL: It's not just the fog
I'm worried about.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.367
We're driving over
an ice field
littered with cracks,

11:48.433 --> 11:50.333
some hundreds of meters deep.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.567
There's no way our sensors
can cut through this soup.

11:52.633 --> 11:55.633
Virgil, this would be
a p-perfect opportunity

11:55.700 --> 11:58.300
to test MAX's
scanning ability.

11:58.367 --> 12:02.067
He can plot a safe course
around even
the tiniest of cracks.

12:02.133 --> 12:03.433
Sounds good to me.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.867
Even a small one
could swallow this Pod whole.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.733
All right, MAX,
time to live up to your name.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.867
Huh? Mechanical Assistant
Experimental.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.067
-Remember?
-Ah.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.633
(BEEPING)

12:22.700 --> 12:26.067
BRAINS: That's it, MAX.
Steady as she goes.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.133
SCOTT:
It's gaining in intensity.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.667
We don't have much time.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.667
Pick up the pace, MAX.

12:42.067 --> 12:43.100
(MAX SHRIEKS)

12:43.167 --> 12:44.567
VIRGIL: Oh, MAX!

12:46.167 --> 12:47.733
-(MAX WHINES)
-Whoa!

12:51.867 --> 12:53.067
(BEEPS)

12:53.133 --> 12:54.400
VIRGIL: Hold on.

13:00.367 --> 13:02.400
I can just about reach.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.300
(MAX SHRIEKS)

13:06.367 --> 13:07.567
Whoa!

13:07.633 --> 13:11.233
(GROANS) The weight of the Pod
is making the ice unstable.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.700
Hang on, MAX.
I'll try another angle.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.367
Come on, MAX.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.567
Oh, no!

13:42.700 --> 13:44.267
Argh, I got him.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.633
Phew.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.100
T-Thank you, Virgil.

13:51.167 --> 13:54.533
VIRGIL: That's it. We are
going to have to wait
until the fog clears.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.800
SCOTT: If we stop now,
we'll lose precious time.

13:56.867 --> 13:59.800
VIRGIL: And if we don't,
we may not make it at all.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.867
-What's going on
with you today?
-Me?

14:13.933 --> 14:17.367
We're on a mission.
We need to do everything
we can to get there ASAP

14:17.433 --> 14:19.100
and you're taking
the scenic route.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.267
It's the safe route.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.933
(SCOFFS) I didn't come here
to be safe.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.867
You can't keep pushing
everyone and everything
to the limit.

14:24.933 --> 14:27.767
Hey, I don't push
anyone harder than
they need to be pushed.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.267
You're so darn determined,
you don't see the danger.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.767
We almost lost MAX.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.467
MAX is just a machine.

14:33.533 --> 14:36.500
Brains is constantly
breaking him apart
and rebuilding him stronger.

14:36.567 --> 14:39.833
You don't know
what you're capable of
unless you keep pushing.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.467
But we're not machines.

14:41.533 --> 14:43.700
Someone has got
to step forward.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.667
I'm just doing what Dad did.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.067
He never gave up.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.400
Dad worked hard
but even he knew
there were limits.

14:49.467 --> 14:53.100
-He couldn't do it all.
-But I have to do it all.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.933
I couldn't save Dad

14:55.067 --> 14:56.267
but maybe I can make up
for it.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.433
-By saving everyone else?
-(SCOFFS)

14:58.500 --> 15:01.600
But keeping our family safe
is equally important.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.100
And we all need you
to be around.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.667
-I miss him.
-I miss him too.

15:07.733 --> 15:11.367
We all do.
It's hard to think he's gone.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.633
If I let myself
think about it...

15:13.700 --> 15:15.333
Keeping busy
with International Rescue

15:15.400 --> 15:18.367
is the only thing I have
to keep me from going crazy.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.067
-Hey, you've still got us.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:21.100 --> 15:23.067
Yeah. Yeah.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.433
-Ready?
-Ready.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.100
(BEEPS) Ready.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.933
I just hope
we made it in time.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.500
Me too, brother.

15:58.567 --> 16:02.433
The generator is moments away
from a massive blow-out.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.567
By my calculations,
the magnitude of
the discharge

16:05.633 --> 16:08.567
will cause
a geomagnetic reversal.

16:08.633 --> 16:12.433
-VIRGIL: Which means?
-The Earth's magnetic
poles will flip.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.733
That event might
be considered catastrophic.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.067
(WHOOSHING)

16:36.067 --> 16:38.133
SCOTT: What exactly happens
if the poles flip?

16:38.200 --> 16:42.067
BRAINS: The most likely event
will be a dramatic change
in weather patterns

16:42.067 --> 16:45.467
resulting in crop damage
and worldwide starvation.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.933
(GROANS) That sounds pretty
catastrophic to me.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.100
BRAINS: According to
the schematics,
the m-manual override

16:51.167 --> 16:53.267
is housed at the core section.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.967
I've set MAX the route.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.400
Lead the way, MAX.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.767
(MAX BEEPS)

16:58.833 --> 17:01.900
BRAINS: The energy core
should be just
through those walls.

17:01.967 --> 17:05.067
-VIRGIL: And the engineer?
-MAX has located
her heartbeat.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.600
She's inside the main
shut-off area.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.933
-She's still here?
-Pushing to the limit.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.533
Remind you of anyone?

17:16.433 --> 17:18.200
You've got to leave, now!

17:18.267 --> 17:19.433
Not a chance.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.067
I have to get this grounded
before it blows.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.133
(SCREAMS)

17:33.733 --> 17:36.500
(GRUNTS)

17:36.567 --> 17:38.233
How can we help?

17:38.300 --> 17:41.233
I've been trying to get
this grounding receiver
to the top of the generator

17:41.300 --> 17:43.467
ever since I spoke
to your engineer.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.733
-Can you help?
-BOTH: F-A-B.

17:52.633 --> 17:55.067
I'll be at
the control station.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.333
(GRUNTS)

18:10.633 --> 18:12.067
-Ahhh!
-Scott!

18:14.867 --> 18:16.667
-(GRUNTS)
-BRAINS: Scott, Virgil...

18:16.733 --> 18:18.933
-(ALARM BLARING)
-...the energy build-up
has reached critical.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.600
-We have to go.
-We have to keep trying.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.700
Sometimes you have to say
there's nothing else
you can do.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.700
BRAINS: Actually, there is.
We can use MAX.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.233
I've just finished
running the calculations.

18:31.300 --> 18:35.933
His c-conductivity
has been rated
up to 2.5 gigawatts.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.367
That should be enough.

18:37.433 --> 18:40.700
-Let's hope so.
-Okay, Brains, send MAX in.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.400
We need to get out of here.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.700
Here we go, MAX.

19:31.533 --> 19:35.533
You were built strong
for situations just like this.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.100
You can do this, MAX.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.167
You can d-do it.

19:45.833 --> 19:49.500
You're doing great, MAX.
Just a little longer.

20:03.067 --> 20:05.233
SCOTT: Energy grounded.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.233
-It worked!
-(SIGHS)

20:07.300 --> 20:09.033
You can say that again!

20:09.100 --> 20:11.700
Good work, Brains.
You and MAX.

20:11.767 --> 20:13.633
BRAINS: I knew he could do it.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.633
Would you mind going back
to get him?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.700
I should warn you,

20:17.767 --> 20:20.067
it is likely
he's suffered some damage.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.500
VIRGIL: F-A-B.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.633
Sorry, Brains,
that's all that's left.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.633
-MAX was a real hero.
-Hi, MAX.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.167
You made it seem like
it was a complete loss.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.167
But we couldn't salvage
the rest of him.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.533
-This is MAX.
-(BEEPS)

20:43.600 --> 20:46.533
(STUTTERS) Everything else
is simply spare parts.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.700
You really shouldn't
get emotionally attached

20:48.767 --> 20:50.167
to your equipment, gentlemen.

20:50.233 --> 20:53.233
Come on, MAX, let's go
find you some legs.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.233
Ah, it's good to be home.

20:57.233 --> 20:59.633
Yeah, it is.
Let's get some rest.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.333
You gonna tell us
what happened out there?

21:01.400 --> 21:02.633
Nope.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.067
-(CALL BEEPS)
-Sorry, guys,
we have a situation.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.567
(SNORING)

21:07.667 --> 21:09.767
Scott, Virgil.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.700
No, not the cookies, Grandma.

21:11.767 --> 21:14.333
-We'll take this one.
-Head to launch. I'll give
coordinates in flight.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.533
Last one to the launch pad
gets laundry duty for a week.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.533
-(BEEPS)
-Hello, MAX.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.100
Just a few adjustments
and you'll soon be
good as new.

21:27.167 --> 21:30.067
(CHUCKLES) It's good
to have you back.

21:30.133 --> 21:32.167
Shall we move on
to extreme heat?

21:33.633 --> 21:36.367
(FRANTIC BEEPING)
