I'm awake! I'm awake! What?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.300
Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.602
Someone adopted this highway.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.170
Not so loud.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.605
The highway doesn't know
it's adopted.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.507
But we love it just the same.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.643
Well, at least you rented
an SUV for this trip.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.945
Now I don't have
to clean up the mess.

Quick, stick your head
out the window!

02:30.718 --> 02:32.320
No, no, no, no, it's a rental.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.887
Aim inside and blast away.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.356
Anyone want a caramel apple?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.191
-It's a rental.
-No, thanks.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.559
Shave the dog?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.960

02:48.202 --> 02:49.737
What's so funny?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.039
Ha! You checked this out
with half a tank,

02:52.072 --> 02:54.141
but now
it's three-quarters full.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.011
I'm callin' you Santa 'cause you
just gifted us one-quarter tank.

02:58.045 --> 03:02.049
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
calls me Santa.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.052
What are you doing, Dad?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.387
I'm gonna burn
that quarter tank.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.889
Wasting gas
while sitting on my ass.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.224
It's the American way.

(Homer laughs)

03:29.109 --> 03:31.044
Amazing, son!

03:31.078 --> 03:34.582
Unfortunately, your left foot
just grazed the sideline.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.083
Incomplete pass.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.285
Dad, I've got to pee.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.052
Huh? Huh?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.922
I know it's a rental,
but I'd rather go in the woods.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.223
Maybe I should come with you.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.892
Dad, come on.
I'm ten years old.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.294
I can pee by myself.
It's easy.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.028
You just shake it
when you're through.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.162
You do what now?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.799
(zipper opens)

03:51.832 --> 03:53.534
-Sketch what you see.
-Hmm?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.387
Bart, where are you?!

04:13.421 --> 04:15.589
-Bart!
-What is it?

04:15.623 --> 04:18.559
(animalistic shouting):
Bart...!

04:18.592 --> 04:21.995
(bellowing):
Bart!

04:22.029 --> 04:23.163
I don't know,
but I can't shoot it.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.398
Looks like it's pregnant.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.799
Ah, let's wait
till they're born,

04:25.833 --> 04:27.134
and then we'll,
uh, shoot 'em all.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.436
-(Homer grunting)
-(hunters laughing)

04:28.469 --> 04:29.503

04:29.537 --> 04:31.505
Where the heck were you?

04:31.539 --> 04:33.140
Where's Bart?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.108
HOMER:
Okay, this is the hardest news

04:35.142 --> 04:37.077
in the world
for a mother to hear.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.079
Just ease her into it.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.081
Um, you know
that sewing room you wanted,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.684
but we could never
figure out where?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.018
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.687
What? My special little guy.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.088
Don't worry, Lou.
(laughs)

04:48.121 --> 04:49.690
If there's one thing
I've mastered,

04:49.723 --> 04:53.026
it's consoling
distraught parents.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.495
Ma'am? Ma'am?

04:54.528 --> 04:57.130
Can you describe
your son's skeleton?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.333
Ooh! You incompetent...

04:59.367 --> 05:01.034
Look, look,
your boy's gonna be fine.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.836
Now we laid out a grid

05:02.870 --> 05:05.473
and have search teams
fanning out over the forest.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.040
(searchers grunting)

05:07.074 --> 05:08.442
(woman screams)

05:08.476 --> 05:10.478
I'm sorry,
but, uh, because of the grid,

05:10.511 --> 05:13.847
we have to suspend the search
and bring in some ambulances.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.016
(siren wailing)

05:17.918 --> 05:20.220
Where is my son?!

05:24.024 --> 05:26.360
Where am I?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.065
Hmm.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.369
Huh.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.071
(electrical crackling)

05:38.105 --> 05:42.543
("U.S. Air Force Song"

05:42.576 --> 05:46.013
Welcome to Strategic Air
Command, Springfield Station.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.649
If you're watching this tape,
half the world is doomed.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.584
(chuckles)
Says you, General Dead Guy.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.753

is a Titan II missile,

05:52.786 --> 05:54.321
key to a mighty line of defense

05:54.354 --> 05:58.091
that will reduce our casualties
to an acceptable 200 million.

-(sighs)

06:02.295 --> 06:04.064
Dud.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.866
Ay, caramba!

06:05.899 --> 06:07.935
-WOMAN: Bart?
-GROUP: Bart!

06:07.968 --> 06:10.871
-Bart! -Bart!
-HOMER: Bart!

06:10.904 --> 06:14.842
Now don't worry, I have the best
dang bloodhound in the county.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.044
Uh, does your boy smell
like a fox?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.046
-No.
-We're of no use to you.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.014
(howling)

06:21.048 --> 06:24.084
Come on, Bart.
You made your point!

06:24.117 --> 06:26.053
The whole town is looking
for you.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.757
Even that scary old man from the
house with the broken windows.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.925
Bart broke my windows!

06:31.959 --> 06:34.928
It used to be a normal house!
(angry growl)

06:34.962 --> 06:37.465
All right, listen up.
We have a boy-comma-missing,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.933
and you maggots--
you're gonna help find him.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.635
I thought we were ladies.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.104
-You're lady maggots.
-Now see here, Sergeant.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.040
You haven't fed us.
We're pretty close to riot mode.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.876
This is the boy.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.645
Never seen him in my life.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.083
We all get tattoos we regret.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.318
I will find that boy,

06:58.351 --> 07:01.489
and I will toast you
with his blood!

07:01.522 --> 07:03.390
-(groans) -What'd I tell you
about blood toasts, Bob?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.125
To do them,
but not brag about them.

07:09.630 --> 07:13.000
PRESIDENT KENNEDY: Ask not what
your country can do for you.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.603
Ask what you can do
for your country.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.138
Doesn't sound
like any president I know.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.840
(belches)

07:26.013 --> 07:28.916
Freedom!

07:28.949 --> 07:31.151
Oh, I can smell Springfield!

07:31.184 --> 07:33.253

07:33.286 --> 07:35.989
(yelling)

07:37.024 --> 07:38.025
(grunts)

07:38.058 --> 07:38.992
Aw.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.595
Nothing good ever comes
from trying.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.130
(Southern accent):
Private Homer,

07:43.163 --> 07:44.798
you fat stack of mop buckets!

07:44.832 --> 07:47.000
You find something funny
about this?

07:47.034 --> 07:50.170
How about I wipe that smile off
your fat face?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.972
(imitating Marge):
Not my Homie!

07:52.005 --> 07:54.174
Avert your eyes, ma'am.
(grunts)

07:54.207 --> 07:56.710
(gasps)
A phone?! Please.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.712
Dial tone. Dial tone.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.881
-(dial tone)
-Oh, thank God!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.049
(dialing)

08:02.082 --> 08:03.984
I'm looking for a Miss Culls.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.486
First name Tess,
middle initial "T."

08:06.520 --> 08:08.155
Uh, just a sec. I'll check.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.559
Uh, Tess T. Culls.
Tess T. Culls!

08:11.592 --> 08:14.562
Uh, come on! I know you're
hangin' around here somewhere.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.064
-(laughter)
-Why, you little...

08:17.097 --> 08:19.900
When I catch you, I'm gonna
stick a beer tap in ya

08:19.933 --> 08:22.069
and pull till the foam
comes out your ears!

08:22.102 --> 08:23.671
(laughs)

08:23.704 --> 08:25.573
Oh! Oh! (groans)

08:27.741 --> 08:29.577
Oh. I give up.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.179
If you find Bart,
give me his lunch money.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.214
Well, I'm never giving up.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.849
Why not?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.018
Because searching forever
is much easier

08:38.051 --> 08:40.821
than me finding a new friend.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.690
I could be your new friend.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.658
-What was that?
-Nothing.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.493
Shut up!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.929
His lucky cap!

08:50.230 --> 08:53.834
Bart? Bart?
Are you down there?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.502
Milhouse!

08:55.535 --> 08:57.871
I have never been so glad
to see you.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.574
Thanks for not noticing
my new haircut.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.075
Just give me your phone.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.179
I'll go get help!

09:06.213 --> 09:08.749
You can count on me!

09:11.719 --> 09:13.787
I lit these for our son.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.189
Marge, honey,
he's never gonna come back

09:16.223 --> 09:17.791
if he thinks it's a church.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.293
With 78%
of the search area reporting,

09:20.327 --> 09:23.530
Channel Six is now projecting
that Bart Simpson is dead.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.199
That's right. Self-proclaimed
underachiever Bart Simpson,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.201
dead at the age of ten.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.772
Now let's look at the districts
where he's deadest.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.708
(crying)

09:34.742 --> 09:36.443
(doorbell rings)

09:36.476 --> 09:39.379
Lisa, I have news about Bart.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.981
We already know.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.449
(crying)

09:42.482 --> 09:46.119
Oh, Milhouse,
you were his best friend.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.922
(whimpers)

09:48.956 --> 09:50.390
What did you come here for?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.992
Um...

09:52.025 --> 09:53.927
MILHOUSE:
I came to tell her he's alive,

09:53.961 --> 09:56.964
but this feels almost as good
as hugging Harry Horse.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.668
I came to comfort you
in these uncertain times.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.736
Aw.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.471
-(whistle blows)
-It's over!

10:04.504 --> 10:06.073
We're callin' off the search!

10:06.106 --> 10:08.008
-Did they find him?
-No, he's dead.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.476
(cheering)

10:09.509 --> 10:11.344
No! That can't be.

10:11.378 --> 10:16.149
Lord, why do you kill things
that I want to kill?

10:16.183 --> 10:19.653
Take me now, vile rake!

10:19.687 --> 10:22.089
(rhythmic grunting)

10:22.122 --> 10:23.724
(grunting continues)

10:27.194 --> 10:29.997
I think you should look
at Bart's death this way, Bob.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.000
You're free.
You're totally free.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.968
Oh, this slipped off.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.705
Have you ever thought
of how your life could've gone

10:37.738 --> 10:40.708
had you committed
to good instead of evil?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.175
Evil isn't a choice.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.711
Mm. I see.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.946
Why don't we try a little
psychological exercise, Bob?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.115
If I unshackle you,
will you behave?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.382
Try me.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.884
(beeps)

10:52.052 --> 10:53.320
Cut out Bart's picture.

10:53.353 --> 10:57.324
And by so doing,
cut him out of your life.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.126
Don't listen to them, Bob.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.493
-I'm alive. -(psychologist
continues indistinctly)

11:00.527 --> 11:01.561
(grunts)

11:01.594 --> 11:04.064
*

11:05.866 --> 11:07.868
(music stops)

11:08.902 --> 11:10.237
Are you okay there, Bob?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.805
I won't believe he's dead

11:11.839 --> 11:15.008
until I've made soup
from his bones!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.676
-(grunts)
-(groans)

11:16.710 --> 11:19.780
(sighs) Why do I keep giving
them scissors?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.819
(dial tone, dialing)

11:25.853 --> 11:28.021
-(phone rings)
-(crying) Hello?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.990
Hey, Mom, it's me.
Still married?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.158
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.927
He's alive! And sassy!

11:34.928 --> 11:36.629
(groans)

11:39.032 --> 11:41.001
Um, one for the road?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.002
(grunts)

11:42.035 --> 11:43.536
It's a long road.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.038
(grunting)

11:45.072 --> 11:47.007
I'll see you soon.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.042
(laughs)

11:50.077 --> 11:53.413
Hello, Bart...'s friend.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.115
Bart's alive!

11:55.148 --> 11:56.249
Lead me to Bart.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.951
You'll have to kill me first.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.254
But if you kill me,
you'll never find Bart.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.956
Hmm. A conundrum.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.457
How to break you?

12:04.491 --> 12:09.029
Tell me,
do you like light operetta?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.131
Oh, how light?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.232
And a-one and a-two.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.135
* I have a song to sing, O

12:15.168 --> 12:18.471
* Sing me your song, O

12:18.505 --> 12:21.274
* 'Tis sung to the moon
by a lovelorn loon *

12:21.308 --> 12:23.811
* Who fled
from the mocking throng, O *

12:23.844 --> 12:25.979
* The song of the knell
of a churchyard bell... *

12:26.013 --> 12:27.080
I give! I give!

12:27.114 --> 12:29.149
I'll take you to Bart!

12:29.182 --> 12:30.150
* He cracked like an egg

12:30.183 --> 12:31.651
Please stop!

12:31.684 --> 12:33.153
* And began to beg

12:33.186 --> 12:35.088
(groans)
You promised.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.090
* As I sang this song-o

12:37.124 --> 12:39.259
* It's a song of a popinjay,
bravely born *

12:39.292 --> 12:41.761
* Who turned up his noble nose
with scorn... *

12:41.795 --> 12:44.564
Can you at least stab me
in my ear?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.933
No.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.136
Okay, we'll split up
and find Bart.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.338
Thanks for lending this to us,
Ned.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.974
And I'll do the three things
that help the most:

12:54.007 --> 12:55.675
pray, pray, pray.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.477
(starts engine)

12:57.510 --> 12:59.980
What about me?!

13:00.013 --> 13:02.149
I ain't ridin' in that!

13:02.182 --> 13:03.516
No, you're pulling it!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.953
(grunting)
Lousy, no good...

13:05.986 --> 13:09.022
I couldn't pull you
when you were eight! (grunts)

13:09.056 --> 13:11.024
Mm-hmm.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.627
Hmm. Hmm.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.030
Hmm. Angry dad, wise-ass kid.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.799
Now, there's a formula
that never fails.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.802
DAVE: Okay, boys, we're gonna
sing a nice little song.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.504
CALVIN: I want to play cowboys
and Indians.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.173
DAVE:
Calvin, put down that tomahawk.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.008
Calvin. Calvin.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.977
-(whoosh, blow landing, squish)
-Calvin!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.012
CALVIN (chuckles):
You look funny, Dave.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.646
Dave? Dave?!

13:33.680 --> 13:36.449
HIPMUNKS:
* God bless America

13:36.483 --> 13:40.153
CALVIN:
* Give me back my tomahawk...

13:40.187 --> 13:42.355
That's where he is.
But if you jump down,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.191
you can't get back up
and you'll be caught.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.194
So, uh, I guess
that's checkmate.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.528
We're not playing chess.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.730
We're playing a game called
After You.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.165
After me?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.166
If you insist.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
(Milhouse screaming)

13:59.172 --> 14:01.909
Oh, God. I am so sick of these.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.879
(sighs)

14:05.913 --> 14:08.081
Twelfth time's the charm!

14:08.115 --> 14:09.917
Sideshow Bob?!

14:09.950 --> 14:12.685
That's right.
I found your hidey-hole!

14:12.719 --> 14:14.254
You found my heinie hole?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.023
(laughing)

14:16.056 --> 14:17.057
Ah, yes.
(chuckles)

14:17.090 --> 14:19.092
Always
the back-of-the-class wit.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.662
Well, today you're going to be
a real blast.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.999
I don't like the way
he really hit the word "blast."

14:26.033 --> 14:27.767
(both grunting)

14:29.036 --> 14:31.771
(clicking)

14:31.804 --> 14:34.374
BART:
Uh, Bob, it takes two keys.

14:34.407 --> 14:37.177
That way, no nutcase
can do it by himself.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.246
Well, no one ever said
launching two boys

14:39.279 --> 14:41.514
on a 50-year-old missile
would be easy.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.018
Wow! For a 50-year-old missile,
it's in terrific shape!

14:45.052 --> 14:46.619
Shut up!

14:46.653 --> 14:50.190
I'm a kid who appreciates things
that last.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.093
(grunting)

14:53.126 --> 14:55.228
Come on, boy.
Get a good whiff of his scent.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.496
(sniffing)

14:59.967 --> 15:01.801
(Sideshow Bob theme playing)

15:09.342 --> 15:10.743
(phone rings)

15:10.777 --> 15:12.545
MARGE:
Did you find anything?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.082
Uh, we found Bart's sock drawer.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.117
Get back out here!

15:17.150 --> 15:19.386
HUNTER: Well, you can't shoot
her. You know that's a woman.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.589
HUNTER 2: Oh, this is the last
time I hunt with my lawyer.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.124
Son, I can't go no further.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.093
I want to just lie down and die.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.560
Dad, you can't die here.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.062
You have to die
in a nursing home,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.331
where your body falls apart
as you burn through your savings

15:31.364 --> 15:33.166
till you're
a worthless vegetable.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.667
You know, with dignity.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.970
You're right, son.
We're here on a mission.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.272
Now, let's pick out
that Christmas tree.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.174
We're here to find Bart.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.277
Right, right. But we got
a nice eight-footer over here.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.480
She's got a bare patch,
but we'll turn that to the wall.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.949
That's it. I'm not listening
to another word.

15:49.983 --> 15:53.153
BART AND MILHOUSE:
Help! Help! Help!

15:53.186 --> 15:56.589
(strained):
For this, you can thank my time

15:56.623 --> 15:58.958
at Cirque du Soleil.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.593
BART:
More like Cirque du So Lame.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.030
Yes, they are pretty much
all the same.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.833
(grunts)
Just a little further...

16:06.866 --> 16:09.169
Oh, wait, wrong key.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.372
(alarm blaring)

16:12.405 --> 16:14.107
FEMALE VOICE:
Five minutes to launch.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.542
(hissing)

16:15.575 --> 16:17.510
*

16:19.212 --> 16:21.448
(alarm blaring)

16:21.481 --> 16:23.450
BART:
Bob, why are you doing this?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.652
Well, it's perfectly obvious.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.154
Uh, it's...
(sighs)

16:27.187 --> 16:28.455
Give me a moment.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.023
It's an ICBM.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.991
I Commit Bart's Murder!

16:32.025 --> 16:34.794
That's your justification
for killing two kids?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.529
I... Hmm?

16:36.563 --> 16:40.033
Dad, look! It's either
Sideshow Bob or Shaq.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.169
Not me. I'm going that way.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.836
Boy, am I lost.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.205
Shaq, can you help us?

16:45.238 --> 16:46.739
I'm not Superman.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.541
You have a Superman tattoo
on your arm.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.343
How do you know so much
about me?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.345
You're scaring me.
I don't have any money.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.381
(whooshing)

16:57.284 --> 17:00.053
Have you ever thought
of how your life could've gone

17:00.087 --> 17:01.654
had you committed to good?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.323
It is true. I had talent.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.025
I was on Zoom.
Just send it to Zoom!

17:06.059 --> 17:07.927
Box 350, Boston, Mass.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.330
* 02134.
(chuckles)

17:10.363 --> 17:12.832
You don't want to do this.
You're losing it, Bob.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.002
I don't know what's real
and what's hallucination.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.538
*

17:25.145 --> 17:27.114
-(phone rings)
-Hello?

17:27.147 --> 17:28.415
Hello, Doctor. Bob Terwilliger.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.049
Did I catch you at a bad time?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.051
Oh, Bob,
how thoughtful of you to call.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.322
Most prisoners rarely follow up
after leaving me to die.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.091
I just need to know,

17:38.125 --> 17:39.759
should I kill these children?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.894
Sounds like someone's got a case
of the shoulds.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.130
If you're calling to ask,

17:43.163 --> 17:45.365
it means you already know
the answer.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.699
FEMALE VOICE:
T minus two minutes.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.067
Clear blast area.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.103
Just tell me, please!

17:50.137 --> 17:51.771
He's not allowed to talk.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.073
*

17:59.612 --> 18:00.913
(alarm blaring)

18:00.947 --> 18:03.150
(metallic clacking nearby)

18:03.183 --> 18:06.052
Hmm, that sounds like
the ignition sequence

18:06.085 --> 18:09.622
of an LGM-25C Titan II-II
ballistic missile.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.159
I've had just about enough
of your nonsense!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.227
(whooshing)

18:14.261 --> 18:15.662
All right, I owe you one.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.731
So, why'd you save us?

18:18.765 --> 18:22.502
Because I realized I don't want
to kill you anymore.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.971
Milhouse, is there a knife
in my back?

18:25.004 --> 18:27.507
Not that I can see.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.976
Milhouse, is there
a "kick me" sign on my back?

18:30.009 --> 18:31.978
Not that I can see.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.147
-(chuckles)
-Aw!

18:34.181 --> 18:36.916
I just can't get a clean shot.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.685
Also, you don't have a gun.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.853
I'm useless, all right.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.824
What a brilliant
conceptual piece.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.825
Who's it by?

18:45.858 --> 18:47.627
"Norad."

18:47.660 --> 18:49.329
More like Snore-ad.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.630
(laughing)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.199
-(ticking)
-Wait, is it ticking?

18:52.232 --> 18:54.801
*

18:56.002 --> 18:57.770
WILLIE:
Sooner or later,

18:57.804 --> 19:01.040
it all comes down to mopping.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.543
(Sideshow Bob theme playing)

19:07.013 --> 19:09.882
Doctor, I'm happy.

19:09.916 --> 19:10.983
And when I'm released,

19:11.017 --> 19:12.885
after three consecutive
life sentences,

19:12.919 --> 19:15.054
I think I'll open a flower shop.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.023
Oh, that's great, Bob.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.058
Not all my patients
are this successful.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.393
-(electrical crackling)
-Well,

19:20.427 --> 19:22.028
I won't be needing his file
anymore.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.564
And if you're interested,
tomorrow's 9:00 appointment

19:24.597 --> 19:26.165
-just opened up.
-(electrical crackling)

19:26.199 --> 19:27.200
And a 10:00.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.207
(Sideshow Bob theme playing)

19:36.676 --> 19:38.177
(seabirds squawking)

19:38.211 --> 19:40.012
(footsteps approaching)

19:41.214 --> 19:43.250
Your New York Magazine, sir.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.985
This is The New Yorker.
Totally different.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.987
One is the gossip rag
of the glitterati.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.990
The other, an asthmatic dinosaur
that hasn't been relevant

19:51.023 --> 19:53.493
since William Shawn
breathed his last!

19:53.526 --> 19:56.095
Can I go now?
I've got 15 other lighthouses,

19:56.128 --> 19:57.497
and every one's a weirdo.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.098
Not that you are.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.033
Fine. Leave me.
I'll just polish the bulb

20:01.067 --> 20:04.471
and ponder a wasted life
as I walk along the shore.
