WEBVTT

02:01.956 --> 02:03.537
Morning, Consul.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.958
How goes your day?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.095
Stop!

02:39.327 --> 02:42.694
I am so proud of you.

02:44.165 --> 02:48.204
Our name is redeemed.
The Republic is safe.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.327
It was horrible, Mother.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.837
He wouldn't die.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.508
But he is dead now?

02:59.180 --> 03:01.136
He tried to speak to me.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.473
But no words came out.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.766
We must be strong now.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.014
Yes.

03:11.150 --> 03:14.517
The Senate will look to us for leadership.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.358
The people will need a firm hand.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.372
Are you up to the task?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.693
Dominus.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.120
Who are you? Whose child is this?

04:53.252 --> 04:56.039
What did you do?
Let him go, let him go!

04:58.257 --> 05:00.623
No, no, don't!

05:00.759 --> 05:03.045
Please have mercy.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.314
| curse you. Curse you.

05:23.908 --> 05:27.196
l curse you all!

05:27.328 --> 05:29.569
By all the gods below.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.823
l curse you to damnation.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.735
Caesar is dead! Caesar is dead!

06:03.864 --> 06:06.480
He's dead! He's dead!

06:06.617 --> 06:08.653
Caesar is dead!

06:22.883 --> 06:24.874
Leave it, forget it.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.092
You heard what I said!

06:39.483 --> 06:40.518
Mother?

06:44.321 --> 06:46.061
Leave me alone.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.622
Gods, not you as well?
Crying will not help us.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.743
I'm not crying. l'm angry.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.746
May Dis devour that bitch pig Servilia.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.747
What a fool I was.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.749
If I'd not told her
of Vorenus and his wife...

07:07.886 --> 07:10.798
Listen to me. We must never speak
of our part in this.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.967
It may be mistaken for complicity.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.011
Do you understand?

07:15.144 --> 07:17.806
— I'll see her eaten by dogs.
— We may hope.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.350
Dominus, Timon is here.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.814
Timon, good of you to come.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.399
l grieve with you.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.813
— Bad business.
— It is.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.562
— Your mother's all right, is she?
— She's not receiving visitors.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.985
But she's well enough.
Have you men with you?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.530
Ten. So, she's all right, then?

07:33.662 --> 07:36.074
As I said. How's the city?

07:36.206 --> 07:39.664
All's indoors.
Everywhere's dead quiet.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.744
Timon, thank you for coming.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.293
I am so happy to see you.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.629
I came as soon as I heard. I grieve with you.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.753
You're a good friend, thank you.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.596
Are the streets safe?
Can we get out of the city?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.511
— We can.
— We should wait a while

07:56.644 --> 07:57.929
before taking any action.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.394
We do not have
a clear view of the position.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.514
— Antony may...
— lf Antony were alive, he would come to me.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.516
Or send word, at least.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.359
I must assume Antony is dead.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.355
It is quite possible,
but we cannot know that as yet.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.981
Perhaps he's fled the city.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.529
And leave me here? Never.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.277
Put on your travelling clothes.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.620
— Nothing fancy.
— Mother, think.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.707
You heard what Servilia said.
She wants you to run away.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.700
More fool her. Let her try and find me.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.214
She will find you.
You have no talent for hiding.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.207
Castor, pack the money
and the household gods.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.503
Immediately, domina.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.672
Come along, no time to waste.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.683
Antony.

08:44.692 --> 08:48.310
I swear on the black stone
that I will kill them all.

08:48.445 --> 08:53.360
Brutus and Cassius and Casca
and the whole damn lot of them.

08:53.492 --> 08:57.155
They're just Servilia's minions.
This is all her doing.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.697
I told Caesar.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.367
I told him this would happen.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.366
I swear, I will piss on them as they die.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.414
That I should have to run and hide

09:06.547 --> 09:08.788
from those...those worms.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.291
Are you certain?
Are you certain sure he's dead?

09:12.428 --> 09:16.012
Oh, yeah. He's dead all right.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.880
l was there, I saw him.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.428
You were there?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.176
But then why didn't you stop them?

09:22.312 --> 09:24.598
No, I wasn't there.

09:24.732 --> 09:28.691
l was... They delayed me
outside on the steps.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.811
By the time I got inside
the deed had been done.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.939
And the lictors had all run off like rabbits.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.363
That treacherous bastard Vorenus,
he must have been paid off.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.406
He'd left before we got to the Senate House.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.154
He was lured away.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.454
The witch Servilia's woman
told him an evil tale about his wife.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.328
— What did you do then?
— What did I do?

09:49.465 --> 09:52.127
Why, nothing I could do.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.921
Caesar was dead. I was unarmed.

09:56.013 --> 10:00.006
Well, I would have ripped them to pieces
with my bare hands.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.093
That's easy for you to say.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.806
You know nothing of violence.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.400
12 mangy dogs can kill a lion.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.110
Well, if you say so.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.985
What shall we do now?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.278
You can do as you like.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.411
I will go north
and raise an army of monsters.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.155
Then I will come back here

10:25.292 --> 10:30.161
and I will crucify every last one
of those sons of bitches.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.255
What do you mean, I may do as I like?

10:33.383 --> 10:36.671
Why are you here if I may do as I like?

10:36.804 --> 10:39.511
I meant nothing.
Of course I want you to come with me.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.007
Please, if you'd rather take some other lover,
I will not protest.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.350
No, I meant only that...

10:45.479 --> 10:47.185
That I cannot force you
to come with me.

10:47.314 --> 10:51.182
That's where you were
these last hours, I suppose?

10:51.318 --> 10:54.276
Putting your whores into...
into baggage carts.

10:54.404 --> 10:58.363
l have no stomach for a fight with you.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.107
Not now...

11:08.085 --> 11:11.077
I don't want to go north.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.709
The north is ghastly.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.008
— What's your name again?
— Timon.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.389
We're going north.
You and your men will protect the family

11:21.515 --> 11:23.346
until I can gather my own people together.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.885
— lt'll cost you.
- Of course.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.055
I expect no public service from a Jew.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.180
We shall be taking Calpurnia with us,
so we must leave via the Subura.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.692
Calpurnia?

11:32.818 --> 11:34.183
But why do we need to take her?

11:34.319 --> 11:36.150
We must be sure that she is safe.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.362
Well, I don't see her rushing
to see that we're safe.

11:38.490 --> 11:42.199
My dear, we cannot leave
Caesar's widow behind.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.411
It would look ill with the people,
as if we'd abandoned her.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.867
What a bore.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.049
Father.

12:08.812 --> 12:09.722
Father, wake me.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.346
— Hush.
— Wake me.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.440
Hush now, be calm.

12:15.569 --> 12:19.938
I will wake you if you will let me go.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.109
Promise me.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.325
On the fire of Vesta, I promise.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.614
Lovely.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.457
Thank you.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.291
I know I didn't get us
started off on the right foot...

13:22.427 --> 13:25.669
Killing your man and all,
and I'm sorry for that.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.923
But, va, I'll just come straight out with it.
l have a question.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.846
With permission of Venus and Mars...

13:37.275 --> 13:39.061
| ask you to be my wife.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.985
Your wife? Married?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.400
Married. You and me.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.034
If... If you wish it so, master.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.746
No, I'm not your master any more.
You're a free woman.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.126
You can refuse me, I won't be angry.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.210
Well, I won't be best pleased, but you know,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.169
I won't beat you or anything.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.165
A man like me can always make good money.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.543
You'll have a roof over your head, food.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.218
I'll buy you anything you want, dresses, shoes.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.385
Is that a yes?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.808
Yes.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.097
You won't regret it, I promise.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.368
Done.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.979
Thank you, my dear.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.061
Visitors, domina.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.785
Bring them.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.846
Mark Antony, Atia.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.804
How good of you to come, and the children.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.720
Calpurnia, we grieve with you.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.894
My husband is glad to receive you.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.979
You're the first to pay respects.
None of our friends or family have come.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.821
They're afraid.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.324
Yes, that may be so.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.424
We are going to leave the city now.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.043
It's best you come with us.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.262
Leaving? Why?

16:55.390 --> 16:57.051
It is not safe.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.550
Well, that's no matter. I'm glad to die.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.096
My dear lady...

17:01.229 --> 17:04.346
But now that you're here to stand witness,
we must read his will.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.473
His will?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.392
No, I'm sorry. We haven't time.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.192
— It is the proper form.
- We haven't time.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.741
It is the will...

17:16.870 --> 17:20.488
of a dictator of the Roman Republic.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.918
Having made due provision
for the wellbeing and security

17:31.051 --> 17:34.885
of my honest and dutiful wife, Calpurnia,
et cetera,

17:35.013 --> 17:39.677
I leave the sum of 75 denarii
to every enrolled citizen...

17:39.809 --> 17:41.265
Ridiculous. What a waste.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.636
My name and the remainder of my estate

17:44.773 --> 17:47.606
with all legal obligations and benefits,

17:47.734 --> 17:50.726
all property, gold,

17:50.862 --> 17:53.023
silver and other monies,

17:53.156 --> 17:56.148
I leave to Gaius Octavian,

17:56.284 --> 17:58.616
who is henceforth to be regarded

17:58.745 --> 18:02.237
for all intents and purposes as my lawful son

18:02.374 --> 18:04.615
and sole heir.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.082
Octavian? My Octavian?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.701
What else?

18:07.837 --> 18:10.670
He stipulates that the slave known as Posca...

18:10.799 --> 18:14.462
that is l...am to be given my liberty

18:14.594 --> 18:16.755
with an appropriate stipend.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.880
I give you joy of your freedom.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.051
What else?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.175
There are no further bequests.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.144
| see.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.858
Well, congratulations, boy.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.611
Thank you, Posca.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.962
Octavian gets everything? All of it?

18:53.091 --> 18:55.798
He'll get nothing. It's all wax for scraping.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.550
It's a will. It's his by law.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.548
The law is now Brutus and his minions.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.429
Caesar's land and money will go to them.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.680
That is so. They will declare his death
a rightful tyrannicide,

19:09.816 --> 19:13.104
his will and all his acts become null and void,

19:13.236 --> 19:17.149
his property will be intestate.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.867
— They cannot take the name.
— Oh, no.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.984
That's all yours.

19:22.954 --> 19:26.037
Much good may it do you.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.500
Away now.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.837
I may have to take Calpurnia along by force,

19:38.970 --> 19:41.552
so don't be alarmed if she makes a clamour.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.923
Hey, send for your mistress.
Tell her we're leaving.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.346
Mother, I must stay in Rome.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.265
— Eh?
— I must stay in Rome.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.685
I am Caesar's son.
I must protect my status and rights.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.024
There's blood. A proper little Spartan.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.109
You shall have to stay also, Mother.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.739
The family must appear united.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.983
Oh, my strange, brave, pompous
little boy, we're going north.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.404
l'm head of the family.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.698
Strictly speaking,
it is for me to say where we go.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.241
I know you're only trying to be manly
and that's lovely.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.912
But now is not the time.
We are going and there's an end on it.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.831
Antony, listen. Brutus is in a legal bind.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.045
I think we can force him
into making a deal with us.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.914
Go on.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.418
Brutus must declare Caesar a tyrant,
else the act of killing Caesar is murder.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.216
But all the acts of a tyrant are unlawful,

20:24.349 --> 20:26.681
Including those appointing Brutus as Praetor,

20:26.810 --> 20:28.425
Cassius as Proconsul,

20:28.561 --> 20:31.098
- and so forth.
— And then so?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.596
lf Brutus honours the law,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.597
he loses all rank and position.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.235
lt's lawyers' prattle.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.068
I don't think so. If you offer them amnesty

20:39.197 --> 20:41.609
— in return...
— Amnesty?

20:41.741 --> 20:44.403
I'm gonna eat their livers. Amnesty?

20:44.536 --> 20:45.901
You're not following me.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.823
Enough! You think
you know better than Antony?

20:47.956 --> 20:50.868
- But you don't understand.
— Juno's cunt, must I slap you?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.742
If the will stands, and it might,

20:53.878 --> 20:57.211
you are mother to the richest man in Rome.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.458
If the will is broken, Servilia has that honour.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.422
No.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.426
Where is this damn woman?

21:08.435 --> 21:11.802
When I give you the nod,
I want you to help me seize the old lady

21:11.938 --> 21:14.520
and get her outside quick.
She trusts you, ne?

21:14.649 --> 21:17.231
— Sir, with all respect...
— What?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.851
With all respect, until the will is ratified,

21:19.988 --> 21:21.899
I am bound to serve the house of Caesar.

21:22.031 --> 21:26.240
With that in mind, I must beg you
not to take my mistress by force.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.951
— With all respect.
— Respect?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.911
You impudent toad.

21:31.040 --> 21:35.409
You'll do as I say, and lwill do as I please
with your damn mistress.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.081
Antony?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.124
We're staying.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.800
No, thank you, master.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.095
You've got to stop calling me that.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.688
What shall I call you, then?

21:57.817 --> 22:01.981
Anything you want. Husband? Honey?

22:03.740 --> 22:06.197
Caesar is dead! Caesar is dead!

22:07.577 --> 22:09.659
Caesar is dead!

22:10.705 --> 22:12.036
Caesar is dead!

22:35.772 --> 22:37.387
Don't worry.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.973
If he comes back, he comes back.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.322
There.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.361
See how fine she looks?

23:33.538 --> 23:35.574
She'll be well respected.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.787
A woman from good people.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.912
Hello, children.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.385
Immortals!

23:51.514 --> 23:53.470
Immortals, I say.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.386
You noblemen have carved your names

23:55.518 --> 23:58.134
deep in the eternal stone.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.058
That is very high praise indeed.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.317
I would embrace you all but I'm desolated

24:03.443 --> 24:06.480
that you did not enlist me
in your cohort of heroes.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.820
To wield the Iiberators' knife...

24:08.948 --> 24:10.563
what joy you have denied me.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.816
Forgive us.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.489
But we rather thought you'd prefer not to know.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.204
It is done.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.325
I cannot share in your glory.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.127
I can only applaud.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.466
Now tell me, is the city secure?

24:34.599 --> 24:36.590
We have 2,000 men under arms.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.559
— Caesar's people have fled.
— The city is ours.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.599
Excellent, and Mark Antony?
The dog is dead, I hope.

24:42.732 --> 24:46.975
- He is not.
— Mark Antony is alive?

24:47.111 --> 24:48.612
An error!

24:48.738 --> 24:51.855
I think, a deep error.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.233
We are senators, not hired thugs.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.080
Kill him yourself if you want it so.

24:58.206 --> 25:02.245
Well, well, you know best
what is the right thing to do.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.868
I must go. I'm away to the country.

25:05.004 --> 25:10.169
Another tedious lawsuit.
Ijust wanted to salute you before I left.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.087
Immortal Iiberators.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.844
Friend Cicero.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.305
Why so pale?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.197
Brother?

25:36.911 --> 25:38.447
Vorenus?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.831
— Legionary Pullo, Second Century...
— What's happened?

25:40.957 --> 25:43.869
..First Cohort, First Cohort.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.748
Brother Vorenus, what's happened?

25:53.928 --> 25:57.091
She's mother to the boy Lucius.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.267
I was...going to kill her.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.554
I had the knife in my hand.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.347
She did it herself.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.814
Miseria.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.067
— Where are the children?
- Gone.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.316
Gone where?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.414
I cursed them.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.208
I cursed them to Hades.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.592
Get some water.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.804
Brother Vorenus.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.761
Brother Vorenus.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.102
Come sit down.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.482
Let's get you cleaned up.

27:02.371 --> 27:07.832
Consul Antony, I am here
strictly as an impartial arbiter.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.793
I knew nothing of this disturbing act.

27:11.964 --> 27:16.799
I was as surprised and...
and shocked as you were.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.294
As Brutus can confirm.

27:20.598 --> 27:21.963
Cicero knew nothing.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.226
You have lost a good friend and patron today.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.970
We are sorry.

27:30.733 --> 27:34.066
If that monkey remains
I shall have to open his neck.

27:34.612 --> 27:37.354
He tried to kill me this morning.
His presence is an insult.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.572
You're mistaken. No one tried to kill you.

27:39.700 --> 27:43.033
It was my express order that you be spared.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.244
Am I, Cassius? Mistaken?

27:45.373 --> 27:48.581
We do apologise
if this man's been overzealous.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.203
Go, Quintus.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.252
Tell us, Antony...

28:01.389 --> 28:04.051
to what do we owe this unexpected pleasure?

28:04.684 --> 28:05.673
Listen.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.181
Why so quiet?

28:12.316 --> 28:14.477
A tyrant is dead.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.393
Surely the people should be happy.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.397
Where is the cheering throng at your door?

28:20.533 --> 28:23.024
Where are the joyous cries of liberty?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.570
The people fear change.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.616
A sombre mood is only...natural.

28:27.748 --> 28:31.081
When they realise they are free from tyranny,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.417
the people will be glad.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.333
The people loved Caesar.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.922
And they will hate you for what you've done.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.758
They loved him once. As I did.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.550
Some have turned against him, no doubt.

28:44.682 --> 28:48.971
It cannot be denied
he was something of a tyrant.

28:50.313 --> 28:55.273
But a great many people
will worship Caesar until they die.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.062
A great many.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.810
And those people are mine now.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.986
We do not need such people.
Our men—at—arms have secured the city.

29:04.118 --> 29:08.612
We've received representatives from the best
elements. The Senate is with us, the knights.

29:08.748 --> 29:12.411
The pontiffs, the urban cohorts,
the lictors' guild.

29:12.543 --> 29:16.252
Oh, the lictors' guild, very good.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.792
Only rally the bakers and the flute—players,

29:18.925 --> 29:21.712
and you can put on a festival.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.796
Best wait till after the elections, though.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.931
What elections?

29:32.188 --> 29:34.395
Surely you've thought this through.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.228
If Caesar was, as you insist, a tyrant,

29:38.361 --> 29:41.819
then all his acts
and appointments are nullified.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.404
I am no longer consul,

29:43.532 --> 29:47.024
you're no longer praetor,
you're no longer proconsul.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.617
Elections will have to be held.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.488
That is so.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.285
Messy things, elections.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.535
You spoke of helping us?

29:57.672 --> 29:58.957
Idid.

30:00.091 --> 30:04.585
All those that loved Caesar,
but hate tyranny...

30:04.720 --> 30:07.712
I may be able to bring to your side.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.463
Why would you do that?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.215
Neither of us can win outright.

30:11.352 --> 30:14.719
Not without much blood spilled
to prove the issue.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.561
I want no more blood.

30:16.691 --> 30:19.558
I want peace and stability.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.730
How?

30:23.197 --> 30:26.530
First, a general amnesty.

30:28.077 --> 30:32.320
Caesar is not declared tyrant,
nor you declared killers.

30:32.456 --> 30:37.701
All Caesar's acts, and his will, shall stand.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.623
We shall all keep our posts.

30:39.755 --> 30:44.624
It will be as if he were struck by lightning.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.921
A natural death.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.052
Go on.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.423
Then a show of unity.
A public funeral for Caesar,

30:52.560 --> 30:55.176
led by you and I together.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.930
We shall mourn the man and burn the tyrant.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.852
And then?

31:00.985 --> 31:04.102
I shall serve out
the rest of my term as consul,

31:04.238 --> 31:07.230
and then retire quietly to the provinces

31:07.366 --> 31:09.743
where I will plough my fields

31:09.869 --> 31:12.781
and fuck my slaves.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.574
Just like old Cincinnatus.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.537
And the Republic shall roll on without me.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.412
I swear on the black stone,

31:23.549 --> 31:25.881
I am done with politics.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.797
You people play too rough

31:28.929 --> 31:32.296
for a simple soldier like me.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.970
Knives in the Senate House?

31:36.353 --> 31:38.605
Didn't think you had it in you.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.223
And if we do not wish
to be reconciled with you?

31:42.359 --> 31:47.023
Well, if we cannot be friends,
then we shall be enemies.

31:47.156 --> 31:50.944
And I will do my very best to annihilate you.

31:56.499 --> 32:00.083
Perhaps you would give us
some time to talk this over?

32:01.253 --> 32:04.541
You can talk all you like.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.919
I shall wait outside.

32:21.941 --> 32:25.525
You tried to kill him despite everything I said?

32:25.653 --> 32:27.314
Forgive me.

32:28.364 --> 32:31.982
Your scruples do you credit,
but without your knowledge

32:32.118 --> 32:34.154
his death could not have dishonoured you...

32:34.286 --> 32:36.402
To the contrary, I will be twice dishonoured.

32:36.539 --> 32:37.995
A killer and a fool.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.161
Is your honour worth more than the Republic?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.454
It is not too late.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.829
He's here, in your hands.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.173
I'm simply stating the facts.

32:49.301 --> 32:55.388
I do not urge you
to any particular course of action.

32:56.851 --> 33:00.844
Nor will I take the course you do not urge.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.436
Brother.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.396
It is the only rational thing to do.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.686
He's broken no capital law.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.811
And he offers a truce
which will preserve the public order.

33:09.947 --> 33:13.860
— We have no right to take his life.
— Damn the law! He's too dangerous to live.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.406
You exaggerate him. He is a vulgar beast.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.371
Without Caesar he will
destroy himself soon enough.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.411
- He is...
— He is a guest in my house.

33:23.544 --> 33:27.287
He is not in the house. He is on the street.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.210
You too, Mother?

34:15.221 --> 34:17.212
Consul Antony...

34:22.269 --> 34:24.305
we shall be friends.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.362
Fnends,eh?

35:01.809 --> 35:03.049
My God.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.574
There. That's better.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.327
— I shouldn't have done it.
— What's that?

35:33.757 --> 35:35.918
I cursed my own children, Pullo.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.466
It wasn't their fault.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.553
Don't worry, they'll be back.

35:42.224 --> 35:46.342
You can lift the curse then, no trouble.
You didn't kill an animal on it, did you?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.469
— No.
— There you go, then.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.764
The curse isn't sealed.

35:52.943 --> 35:56.527
And when they come back, you can lift it.
No harm done.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.529
What if they don't come back?

36:02.661 --> 36:06.074
Where else they gonna go?
Course they're coming back.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.507
Tomorrow, at the fourth hour,

36:18.635 --> 36:23.595
a funeral service will be held
for Gaius Julius Caesar.

36:23.724 --> 36:27.808
Under terms of truth
and in the spirit of unity and forgiveness,

36:27.936 --> 36:29.927
eulogies will be delivered

36:30.064 --> 36:33.477
by Praetor Marcus Junius Brutus

36:33.609 --> 36:36.066
and Consul Mark Antony.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.779
No prostitutes, actors

36:39.907 --> 36:43.149
or unclean tradesmen may attend.

37:23.367 --> 37:26.859
I am come to pay my respects
to your husband.

37:38.549 --> 37:41.256
I understand you are grieving.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.842
Show her what she's done.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.700
So Vorenus went home
to confront his wife

38:50.829 --> 38:54.196
and Caesar went to the Senate
alone and unprotected.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.664
Bastards.

38:58.629 --> 39:00.210
What I don't understand

39:00.339 --> 39:04.378
is how they knew about Niobe and all that
in the first place.

39:04.510 --> 39:07.502
You and I were the only ones
that knew the truth.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.511
I told my sister.

39:10.641 --> 39:12.757
And she told Servilia.

39:12.893 --> 39:15.976
My sister was... It doesn't matter.

39:16.104 --> 39:20.017
The jug is broken,
I cannot mend it with regret.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.729
I ask for your forgiveness.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.770
Of course.

39:26.907 --> 39:29.614
I can't expect a young lad like yourself to be...

39:29.743 --> 39:31.734
to be...

39:31.870 --> 39:34.361
Anyway, it's done, as you say.

39:34.498 --> 39:37.365
You should not repeat what I have told you.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.164
It's not that I'm ashamed, though I am.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.163
It's only that it will not look good
with the people.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.381
It's forgotten already.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.927
Sorry about your uncle.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.884
I am made his son by will.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.514
Congratulations?

40:00.065 --> 40:01.646
You'll be wanting vengeance, then?

40:01.775 --> 40:03.640
At some point.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.733
I'll be up for the duty, of course.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.893
Oh, come on, get up.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.982
Have you forgotten what day it is?

40:46.111 --> 40:48.102
What day is it?

40:48.864 --> 40:51.856
Don't play with me.
I'm not up for it today.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.778
Relax.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.946
It's gonna be my day.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.694
I can feel it.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.950
I don't think I've ever fucked a woman
in a funeral dress before.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.496
Nor shall you now.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.120
That's a shame.

41:06.256 --> 41:08.668
It'll have to be Merula, then.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.258
Come here, old girl. Jump on.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.878
She'd eat you alive.

41:15.015 --> 41:18.382
Come on, this is no morning for foolery.
Just get up.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.258
Come here.

41:20.395 --> 41:23.887
Stop fooling around and just get up!

41:24.024 --> 41:28.142
I am not rising from this bed
until I've fucked someone.

41:28.278 --> 41:31.315
Fine. Merula, fetch that German slut
from the kitchen.

41:32.282 --> 41:36.992
Come on, get it right this time or you'll be next
for the King of Goats over there.

41:47.464 --> 41:50.080
Undertaker's here. We're ready to go.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.337
We must wait for the children.

41:56.056 --> 41:58.263
They'll be back, brother.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.305
I shouldn't have done it.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.435
I shouldn't have cursed them.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.313
They'll be back. I'm sure of it. Sooner or later.

42:15.575 --> 42:19.067
I shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have done it.

42:34.302 --> 42:37.510
We've got to send Niobe on her way now.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.675
We can't leave it any longer, can we?

42:41.059 --> 42:43.266
Else them below will be vexed.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.463
Please. Please.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.410
Grain monitor?

47:09.536 --> 47:12.027
Why on Gaia's earth would
I want to be grain monitor?

47:12.163 --> 47:14.700
It would give you reason to leave with dignity.

47:14.833 --> 47:17.165
I have no intention of leaving the city.

47:17.293 --> 47:21.707
A tour of the Asian supply ports
would be the most natural thing in the world.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.957
Nobody could possibly
accuse you of running away.

47:25.093 --> 47:27.709
I have no intention of leaving the city!

47:27.846 --> 47:29.427
Servilia, my dear...

47:30.598 --> 47:33.010
Sorry about all this.

47:34.602 --> 47:37.218
Got a bit carried away.

47:37.355 --> 47:41.223
You gave an excellent speech, incidentally.

47:42.235 --> 47:45.318
It was perhaps a touch too cerebral

47:45.447 --> 47:46.732
for that audience, but...

47:46.865 --> 47:48.856
Have you been offered any refreshment?

47:50.452 --> 47:52.408
Some water will be lovely.

47:52.537 --> 47:53.743
Thank you.

47:55.665 --> 47:58.907
Please, speak sense to your son.

47:59.044 --> 48:02.081
Him and his friends must leave the city.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.295
I cannot answer for their safety.

48:04.424 --> 48:06.585
Do not look so pleased with yourself.

48:06.718 --> 48:09.004
You're a liar and a breaker of oaths,

48:09.137 --> 48:11.594
and you've roused your rabble, nothing more.

48:11.723 --> 48:15.432
A pantomime actor might have
done what you did today.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.097
Lucky then it was me that did it, eh?

48:18.229 --> 48:21.847
Else you would now be on your knees
sucking pantomime cock.

48:25.487 --> 48:29.400
I have no wish to abuse or humiliate you.

48:31.534 --> 48:33.195
I only wish you gone.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.323
We're going nowhere.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.906
No, not you, at least.

48:40.043 --> 48:41.954
The men shall leave.

48:43.546 --> 48:48.085
You will stay here in the city with me,
as my guest.

48:49.427 --> 48:53.295
— Hostage, you mean.
- As you like.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.137
You may wish as you will.

48:55.266 --> 48:58.758
We yet have all the Senate behind us
and all the men of quality.

49:01.648 --> 49:04.640
And I have an angry mob...

49:05.860 --> 49:09.318
that will roast and eat your "men of quality"

49:09.447 --> 49:12.610
in the ashes of the Senate House!

49:21.543 --> 49:24.455
Children? Eldest?

49:26.339 --> 49:27.840
Vorena?

49:29.092 --> 49:30.502
They're not here.

49:33.763 --> 49:36.800
Never mind. Just have to be patient.

49:39.018 --> 49:42.010
How about you make us
a nice pot of porridge?

49:42.147 --> 49:45.139
We'll all feel better with some food inside us.

49:54.826 --> 49:57.192
— Vorena?
— Anyone here?

50:04.169 --> 50:06.626
I'm sorry.
I was only taking back things I lent.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.790
Hush, it doesn't matter.
Do you know where the children are run to?

50:08.923 --> 50:10.584
I swear, only things I lent.

50:10.717 --> 50:12.628
Do you know where the children are?

50:12.760 --> 50:14.261
Speak!

50:14.387 --> 50:16.423
Erastes Fulmen took them.

50:17.432 --> 50:19.218
Porca Juno.

50:19.851 --> 50:21.716
I'm very sorry for your loss.

50:44.584 --> 50:48.998
The place is fucking packed, yeah? Takes me
half an hour to fight me way to the front

50:49.130 --> 50:51.746
and up steps Brutus.

50:51.883 --> 50:53.089
Right?

50:53.218 --> 50:56.085
And he goes, "Blah, blah, blah.

50:56.221 --> 50:58.928
"The law this and the Republic that.

50:59.057 --> 51:00.422
"And the 12 bloody tables."

51:00.558 --> 51:02.264
I couldn't understand half of it.

51:02.393 --> 51:03.894
Yeah, yeah, then what happened?

51:04.020 --> 51:06.887
Then, Antony's up. But he gives Brutus a hug.

51:07.023 --> 51:10.481
He starts talking all calm and gentle
like he's not bothered.

51:10.610 --> 51:13.272
And I'm thinking, "Bollocks,
we'll be away for a bevvy."

51:13.404 --> 51:15.440
But then...

51:15.573 --> 51:17.689
he pulls out Caesar's toga,

51:17.825 --> 51:19.326
all covered in blood.

51:19.452 --> 51:21.693
Everyone goes, "Whoa!"

51:21.829 --> 51:24.320
Disgusting. No fucking dignity, that man.

51:24.457 --> 51:27.199
But now, Antony's stalking
up and down with the toga

51:27.335 --> 51:30.623
and he's crying about
"What a good man was Caesar"

51:30.755 --> 51:34.293
and how much he loves him
and what a great leader we've lost

51:34.425 --> 51:36.677
until the crowd...
half of them are crying...

51:36.803 --> 51:38.589
they're sobbing like babies.

51:38.721 --> 51:41.929
And then what does he do?
He takes the bloody toga...

51:43.268 --> 51:45.054
and throws it into the crowd. Whoosh!

51:45.186 --> 51:47.643
The whole fucking place went up
like a tar barrel.

51:47.772 --> 51:49.478
The whole fucking crowd went mad.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.314
Brutus and them are lucky to be alive.
If they are.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.025
It's a disgrace. No fucking respect.

51:55.154 --> 51:58.112
— Yeah, well people get angry, don't they?
— No excuse.

51:58.241 --> 52:00.607
It's a consular fucking funeral, isn't it?

52:01.202 --> 52:04.660
Supposed to show some fucking respect.

52:04.789 --> 52:07.405
Not run around looting and burning.

52:07.542 --> 52:09.157
Animals.

52:10.503 --> 52:13.119
That Antony's a cunt, too.

52:13.256 --> 52:15.292
Mark me, now.

52:15.425 --> 52:20.465
Any one of you cunnies join in this disgrace,
you'll be disjointed quick as Pan.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.804
We observe the fucking decencies.

52:26.227 --> 52:27.933
— Right?
— Right.

52:45.371 --> 52:48.829
Fucking slaves and foreigners to blame.

52:50.335 --> 52:54.624
Send them back to Bithynia,
or wherever the fuck you come from.

52:57.592 --> 52:59.833
Rome for fucking Romans, eh?

53:05.224 --> 53:06.680
Flavio?

53:06.809 --> 53:10.267
Tell those damn scurras to shut that up!

53:10.396 --> 53:12.637
They want to fight, take it outside.

53:15.026 --> 53:17.608
Keep your hands above it!

53:17.737 --> 53:19.193
Flavio!

53:20.656 --> 53:22.988
Fucking useless.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.752
You have my children.

53:40.843 --> 53:42.299
You have my children.

53:42.428 --> 53:45.795
Eh? What the fuck you talking about?

53:45.932 --> 53:49.720
You have my children.

53:50.978 --> 53:53.105
Someone's misled you, friend.

53:54.399 --> 53:56.435
Where are they?

53:56.567 --> 53:57.818
I don't know.

54:03.741 --> 54:04.730
Where are they?

54:05.410 --> 54:06.741
Flavio!

54:09.414 --> 54:11.200
Flavio's not coming.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.057
Here we are, then.

54:36.190 --> 54:37.896
Where are they?

54:38.025 --> 54:39.686
Where are my children?

54:43.114 --> 54:45.446
Will you have a little wine with me?

54:45.575 --> 54:47.406
No? Well...

54:47.535 --> 54:49.196
kiss my arse.

54:50.496 --> 54:52.657
Tell him.

54:52.790 --> 54:56.374
If they're not harmed, you may yet live.

54:58.129 --> 54:59.710
You think so?

55:00.673 --> 55:01.788
Tell him.

55:05.887 --> 55:09.300
Nothing like a good Falernian grape, is there?

55:11.017 --> 55:13.599
You're not a bad sort of man, Vorenus.

55:13.728 --> 55:15.684
You just have too much anger in you.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.019
Tell him!

55:19.609 --> 55:23.648
I took your children in payment
for your many slights to me.

55:23.779 --> 55:27.067
I fucked them then I killed them.

55:27.200 --> 55:30.158
And then I threw them in the river.
