in Canberra.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.560
The bodies were identified

00:22.620 --> 00:25.560
as brothers Jake and Gordon
Metherill from Queanbeyan.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.160
The plumbers.

You didn't. You wouldn't.

someone who appreciates my passion.

leaving the room quickly?

No, but I don't...

of here without any notice.

I...I know the law.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.440
I make the law.

agreement

subletting your space,

how selfish you've been?

won't result in me getting a slap?

(CHUCKLES) Good girl.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.040
There were no deaths,

11:25.100 --> 11:28.040
but there was quite a bit of
physical damage, and political.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.680
So, I mean, it has to be attempted
manslaughter at least.

There's no such thing
as attempted manslaughter, mate.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.400
By definition, you can't attempt
the accidental death of someone.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.360
Terry, I need to give
the Chinese something.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.400

11:46.460 --> 11:47.760
There's attempted assault.

What, by leaning on a screen?
Which nobody saw me do, by the way.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.480
And which resulted in a couple
of people getting bruised.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.080
You pushed over the screen...
I leaned.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.160
..with the intention of causing
grievous bodily harm

11:57.220 --> 11:58.760
on a race of people that you hate.

11:58.820 --> 12:01.080
Oh, the whole race? With one screen?

12:01.140 --> 12:03.040
Your father served in Korea,
didn't he?

12:03.100 --> 12:04.640
Yes. And?
There you go.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.680
What do you mean "there you go"?

12:06.740 --> 12:11.080
Let's go with the whole
hate-slash-terrorism line.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.480
That way, we can have a trial
in Canberra,

12:13.540 --> 12:15.160
no press, no public.

12:15.220 --> 12:17.080
We can have him off to an island
by Thursday.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.160
Terrorism is clean, uncontroversial.

12:19.220 --> 12:20.560
And chuck in the hate crime...

12:20.620 --> 12:22.840
Oh. You people...
You're...you're mental.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.320
You have deliberately destroyed
years of patient diplomacy.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.360
Whose diplomacy?

12:27.420 --> 12:29.680
You've been Prime Minister
for about seven seconds, mate.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.960
I mean the South China Sea
is about to erupt.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.040
I mean you have no idea the shit
I had to eat

12:34.100 --> 12:35.640
from the Chinese this morning.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.440
You know, if I close my eyes, Cal,

12:38.500 --> 12:41.680
it's almost as if
you're channelling my sister.

12:41.740 --> 12:46.600
I mean, your voice is a couple
of octaves higher, but it's uncanny.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.880
So?

12:49.940 --> 12:53.000
Oh, they're talking
terrorism charges.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.040
What?!
Hilarious. Yeah.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.320
I mean, they're gonna try and
pin me with whatever they can get.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.040
But it's pretty funny.
I'm actually quite...

12:59.100 --> 13:00.440
(EXCLAIMS)
I know.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.840
I'm looking forward to it - it'll be
a big day with the press obviously.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.960
Terrorism?
Terrorism.

13:04.020 --> 13:07.040
I mean, I leant against the screen,
or is it leaned?

13:07.100 --> 13:08.920
Um... Well, leaned or leant?

13:08.980 --> 13:11.960
That is the deputy secretary
of the Chinese Embassy

13:12.020 --> 13:13.560
waiting outside your office.

13:13.620 --> 13:14.640
The whatty...what?

13:14.700 --> 13:15.960
Why? Well, has he got an
appointment?

13:16.020 --> 13:18.080
No, but I'm thinking
that he doesn't need one.

13:18.140 --> 13:19.320
Well, why do I want to see him?

13:19.380 --> 13:21.360
Because he's here
and he was the groom.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.920
Oh, my God. He's the groom.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.400
Oh, shitballs.
Yep.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.560
Oh, wow, he looks fit.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.720
Yeah. Pretty, pretty fit.

13:31.780 --> 13:34.960
Like, I'm talking Jet Li.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.640
You mean Bruce Lee.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.000
No, I mean Jet Li.

13:38.060 --> 13:41.520
Who's Jet Li? Oh, you're thinking of
Jason Scott Lee, Bruce's son.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.400
No, Bruce's son was Brandon Lee.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.680
I don't care
if it's Jennifer Jason...

13:45.740 --> 13:47.000
Just shush, shush.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.920
Let me focus here.

13:48.980 --> 13:51.840
Listen, could you just get some sort
of emergency medical services

13:51.900 --> 13:53.720
on standby, please?

13:53.780 --> 13:55.640
OK, I'll call the Coroner.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.240
Ah, Deputy Secretary,
a pleasure to meet you.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.400
Senator Greene, how do you do?

14:06.180 --> 14:08.560
It has been a pleasure.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.240
He seemed nice.
Yeah.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.560
I mean, that went a lot better than
I thought it would.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.160
Just keep your head back.

14:20.220 --> 14:22.960
Ah. That's nice.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.440
Mm.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.800
Ohh...

14:28.500 --> 14:30.880
I know this is unfortunate timing

14:30.940 --> 14:34.800
but my people have told me that
you should make your reckoning now.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.040
Make my reckoning? What?

14:37.100 --> 14:38.680
Settle your account.

14:38.740 --> 14:43.720
There is not much confidence amongst
any of the drivers' factions

14:43.780 --> 14:45.800
that you will be a senator
much longer.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.360
I am under considerable political
pressure right now...

14:48.420 --> 14:49.680
Oh, yes, right.

14:49.740 --> 14:51.560
..and in order to
maintain my position,

14:51.620 --> 14:53.400
I have to be seen
to be showing strength.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.440
And what position do you think
I'm in to settle any account, mate?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.560
I'm a homeless person
with a broken nose.

14:58.620 --> 15:01.400
This is about the Princess,
and don't pretend otherwise.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.960
I'll get you a new cat.
Put it on the tab.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.400
Half the money, now.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.680
I don't have half the...

15:06.740 --> 15:09.600
I mean, I don't know how much
the whole amount is, mate,

15:09.660 --> 15:11.760
but I can tell you now
I don't have half of it.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.640
Half the money, or half a finger?

15:13.700 --> 15:14.960
Half a finger?

15:15.020 --> 15:16.960
What, are you
fuckin' Tony Soprano now?

15:23.780 --> 15:25.160

15:25.220 --> 15:27.880
Mate, I've been driving you and that
anally bereft cat of yours

15:27.940 --> 15:29.120
around for weeks now.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.440
That's gotta be worth something.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.200
OK, you get 5% off for driving.
Christ!

15:32.260 --> 15:35.760
How much do you think I owe you?
Let me check. Pass me that ledger.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.120
Yep.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.760
(MUTTERS)

15:44.260 --> 15:46.440
$180,000.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.720
Rounded down.
180,000?

15:49.780 --> 15:51.000
That is impossible, mate.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.920
With interest, very possible.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.000
That is bullshit!

15:54.060 --> 15:56.360
I can't even conceptualise 180 grand,
mate.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.440
Look, it's not just me.
Holy shit!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.160
These are very serious people.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.840
Who, the drivers?

16:01.900 --> 16:04.200
If I don't go back with half
the money or half a finger,

16:04.260 --> 16:07.040
I will lose their respect
and perhaps a whole finger myself.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.040
Oh...

16:08.100 --> 16:09.960
And I don't think that's fair,
under the circumstances.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.720
OK. Well, let's just go down
to an ATM and withdraw $90,000!

16:12.780 --> 16:14.520
I... Alright, I tell you what.

16:14.580 --> 16:15.880
I will...

16:15.940 --> 16:17.360
I'll write you a cheque.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.880
You can be so amusing sometimes,
sir.

16:24.940 --> 16:28.120
Your son has made a lot of money,
has he not?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.600
I don't know.
Why are we talking about my son now?

16:31.660 --> 16:34.520
You do know he's back in Australia?
No, he's not. Since when?

16:34.580 --> 16:35.960
Since this morning.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.360
He would've called.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.440
Well... How do you know these things?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.280
Good God, man.

16:41.340 --> 16:45.240
You still do not understand
the mysteries of power.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.240
True power is never seen.

Why didn't you tell me you were back?

It's a long story, Cleave.

Mate.
It's a real cracker.

It's one for the whole family.

Oh, mate.

What are you doing?

17:37.340 --> 17:38.880
Why is he wearing your robe?

17:38.940 --> 17:40.360
Well, er...the ball was boring,

17:40.420 --> 17:43.000
there was all that screaming coming
from the Chinese wedding next door.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.960
And I invited him back for a drink.
Are you kidding me?

17:45.020 --> 17:47.800
Oh, my God! Are you kidding?

Oh, God. Ohhhh! God!

Oh.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.160
You right in there, Cleave?

17:56.220 --> 18:00.480

in your head!

You're a sick man.
I'm gonna throw up.

You are sick!
You know what, you're right.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.280
You're right, Cleaver.
I was screwed.

see the light.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.560
Oh.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.080
You know, I was like a...like a crab
lugging around his shell

18:30.140 --> 18:33.040
as opposed to a shell lugging
around his crabs.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.520
Oh, see, that's not fun...
You think that's funny.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.880
But you know what?
I have outgrown...

18:36.940 --> 18:38.240
He thinks that's funny.
..my tiny shell.

I now have a new, big roomy one,

18:40.580 --> 18:43.840
with a jacuzzi
and a '70s soundtrack.

Look at him. That's my shell!

18:46.180 --> 18:47.880
Oh, God...
That is my shell.

18:47.940 --> 18:50.160
You gave him my shell.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.880
I didn't give him...
You did!

18:51.940 --> 18:53.480
Stop talking about shells.

you...you were determined to...

..to build someone in my likeness.

18:58.980 --> 19:01.400
Cleaver, I rejected you, remember?
Yes.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.720
Yes, you rejected me

19:02.780 --> 19:05.120
because you wanted to go lounging
around in Sardinia,

19:05.180 --> 19:07.840
and I wanted to stay here
and serve the people.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.920
I rejected you because
I can't actually trust

19:09.980 --> 19:11.880
a single word that
comes out of your mouth.

the people is ridiculous.

and support.

Oh, no, just...just wondering.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.480
Shit, how much?

21:49.540 --> 21:51.360
Mate, it doesn't always
have to be about...

21:51.420 --> 21:54.280
How much, Cleave?
About 90. Quite quickly.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.400
Fuck.
Oh, mate. It's the drivers.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.280
These are serious guys.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.840
They seem to run the planet
and I've lost one of their cats.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.000
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

22:08.180 --> 22:09.880
I'll get him.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.120
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:19.940 --> 22:21.880
Not a word from you.

22:21.940 --> 22:25.520
OK, not a syllable from you.

22:26.540 --> 22:32.280
So, here I was thinking that I was
about to be charged with terrorism

22:32.340 --> 22:34.880
and that'd be fine because I could
defend that, but no.

22:34.940 --> 22:38.160
The charge is fraudulent use of
government property

22:38.220 --> 22:40.800
for personal financial gain, OK?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.480
And that's provable.

22:42.540 --> 22:43.920
The fucking creche.

22:43.980 --> 22:45.480
It was a community service.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.160
She's been charging for it.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.600
I mean, I assumed she...
OK.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.240
..you know, she'd be covering
the costs

22:50.300 --> 22:52.240
of, you know, cheese sticks
and party pies.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.160
How much money do you think
she's made from this thing?

22:54.220 --> 22:55.920
I don't...
I'm not sure exactly.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.640
Rough guess.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.840
120, 130...

23:00.900 --> 23:02.760
Thousand?
Yep.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.080
Dollars?
Yep.

23:05.580 --> 23:08.000
All declared to the Tax Office,
I'm assuming.

23:08.060 --> 23:13.520
There is a serious shortage
of good childcare in the city.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.680
Yeah, and, um...

23:15.740 --> 23:18.760
So, what did you do with this money?

23:18.820 --> 23:22.080
I put it under your mattress
at my place.

23:22.140 --> 23:24.960
Under my mattress, did you?

23:25.020 --> 23:30.080
And so how much money do you think
the nice policeman found

23:30.140 --> 23:31.520
under my mattress?

23:31.580 --> 23:34.720
I think the policeman found
about 100.

23:34.780 --> 23:35.920
100,000?

23:35.980 --> 23:37.760
Yeah, I mean, we spent
a little bit

23:37.820 --> 23:39.560
and then we've got a lot of
family back in Poland.

23:39.620 --> 23:40.800
Oh, yeah.

23:40.860 --> 23:44.800
And, um, oh, I put on, uh, a deposit
for a school for Iain.

23:44.860 --> 23:46.200
Oh, good.

23:46.260 --> 23:52.880
And, so, the nice man literally
found $100,000 under my mattress?

23:52.940 --> 23:54.400
It sounds bad, but...
Doesn't it?

23:54.460 --> 23:56.720
Yeah. It just...snowballed.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.120
It got really out of control.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.120
I mean the kids just adore Mama.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.120
Do they?
And...and the parents adore Mama.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.880
Do they? OK.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.480
Here's how we're gonna play this.
Alright.

24:07.940 --> 24:11.920
You don't speak a word of
English, alright?

24:11.980 --> 24:14.440
I don't want to hear another word
of English from you

24:14.500 --> 24:17.120
until all this fucknuttedness
is over, yeah?

24:17.180 --> 24:20.160
You don't speak a word of Polish.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.240
I'm fluent.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.520
You don't speak a word
of the bastard, alright?

24:24.580 --> 24:26.160
That's the game.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.160
It's all about confusion, yeah?

24:29.220 --> 24:31.200
You came out here as a little girl,

24:31.260 --> 24:33.840
your parents were constantly
squabbling in Polish...

24:33.900 --> 24:35.760
I mean, they fought a little bit,
but they didn't...

24:35.820 --> 24:38.960
Your parents were constantly
squabbling in Polish,

24:39.020 --> 24:41.040
and that's why you've never embraced
their language

24:41.100 --> 24:44.360
because...because it stunted you
emotionally, OK?

24:44.420 --> 24:48.400
Hence, your mum and you have
always had these kind of mix-ups,

24:48.460 --> 24:50.720
these constant misinterpretations.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.440
It's been an albatross around your
neck since you were a little girl,

24:53.500 --> 24:55.320
and that's when you start to cry.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.640
Oh, do I have to cry?

24:57.700 --> 24:59.720
Yes, of course you have to cry!

24:59.780 --> 25:01.760
Are you crazy? How long
have you been working for me?

25:01.820 --> 25:03.360
(PRETENDS TO CRY)

25:04.740 --> 25:08.920
There's always been this void,
a void between us.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.160
My mother and I,

25:10.220 --> 25:14.240
I mean, we just don't understand each
other as a mother and a daughter.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.240
I...

25:17.300 --> 25:19.560
I mean, I...I love her.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.040
I don't know her.

25:22.260 --> 25:25.400
I've been...I've been
in Canberra so busy.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.960
I didn't know
she was running a creche.

25:29.100 --> 25:34.120
And my partner Barney ran off
with a Monica Bellucci look-alike.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.880
And Cleaver Greene
knows nothing about this!

25:36.940 --> 25:39.000
I get the picture, Cleaver.
Do you understand?

25:39.060 --> 25:42.160
You don't speak any English, OK?

25:42.220 --> 25:43.560
Because you're about to be charged.

25:43.620 --> 25:46.000
Jakub will sort out the bail.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.640
Do you understand?

25:47.700 --> 25:48.640
(MOUTHS WORDS)

25:50.980 --> 25:53.960
Do you understand? (MOUTHS WORDS)

25:56.260 --> 25:57.680
So you'll defend us?

25:57.740 --> 26:00.840
I can't defend you -
I'm not at the bar anymore.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.480
I'm gonna have to get an old friend
to do it, or an old enemy.

26:04.540 --> 26:06.600
So he wasn't arrested for terrorism?

26:06.660 --> 26:08.040
What was he arrested for?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.960
His chief of staff's mother
was running a creche

26:10.020 --> 26:11.720
out of his Sydney office.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.200
Misuse of public funds.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.280
Oh, well, next best thing.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.080
It'll be an open trial, Cal.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.000
Jack, would you excuse us?

26:20.060 --> 26:21.240
Sure.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.280
Jane, you may want to
excuse yourself as well.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.600
Seriously.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.480
It's about what happened
in the new...

26:38.540 --> 26:41.000
Well, that is to say
the former Parliament House.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.560
Oh, gee. Is it the terrorists?
Is there another plot?

26:43.620 --> 26:46.040
Because I am not backing away
in a fight from this one, Joe.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.960
It's the last thing
that people wanna see.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.160
Cal, there were no terrorists.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.280
What?
It was dodgy plumbing.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.080
Stuffed electrics.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.480
Just a cigarette butt

26:57.540 --> 27:00.480
thrown at some inappropriately
placed cleaning products.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.320
What are you saying? It was just...

27:02.380 --> 27:05.080
What, an accident?
It was just an accident.

27:05.140 --> 27:07.920
But you guys were all over the news -
from day one it was terrorism.

27:07.980 --> 27:09.160
Yeah, we thought it was for a bit.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.160
But, you know,
that was before we found out

27:11.220 --> 27:13.000
actually what happened
from the plumbers.

27:13.060 --> 27:15.240
Plumbers, what plumbers?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.720
Oh, the ones who just drowned?
The brothers?

27:17.780 --> 27:19.600
As a matter of fact, that was them.

27:19.660 --> 27:22.960
So, what, we...
We retrenched them.

27:23.020 --> 27:27.160
That's all. We retrenched them
with extreme prejudice.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.480
Jesus.
Why did you tell me this, Jack?

27:30.540 --> 27:31.880
Because you've got a choice, Cal.

27:31.940 --> 27:33.320
I have no choice!

27:33.380 --> 27:35.520
I have to go straight to the cops
with this one.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.120
Legally, yes.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.280
But a number of us -
Gareth, Angela, myself -

27:39.340 --> 27:42.240
will probably spend the rest
of our fucking lives in prison.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.960
Oh, yeah, and what would be
the downside for me?

27:45.020 --> 27:46.880
Your government would fall tomorrow,

27:46.940 --> 27:49.480
and you'd be
the shortest-serving Prime Minister

27:49.540 --> 27:50.880
in this country's history.

27:50.940 --> 27:54.680
And what, you say, uh, Greene
knows all about this?

27:54.740 --> 27:56.040
I don't know what Greene knows.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.960
And, what, he's facing
an open trial?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.400
I don't know how he's going to get
the evidence into it.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.040
Oh, it's Greene, you idiot!

28:05.140 --> 28:07.680
He doesn't care if he gets it
into evidence.

28:07.740 --> 28:11.000
He's just gonna put on his circus
act and all the press'll cover it.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.960
(BABY GURGLES)
Bubba.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.560
What the hell?

28:24.620 --> 28:26.760
What?

28:26.820 --> 28:28.720
Your hair.

28:28.780 --> 28:30.160
Oh, this.

28:30.220 --> 28:32.240
Oh. Just trying out a new look.

28:33.740 --> 28:37.080
Miss...
Oh, God. Really?

28:38.620 --> 28:40.040
Really?

28:41.340 --> 28:44.840
Is this...is this really
all it takes, Fuzz?

28:44.900 --> 28:47.280
Fuzz, it's a stupid wig and glasses.

28:48.540 --> 28:53.320
You know that if I take these off,
um, I'm not a different person.

28:53.380 --> 28:56.200
I'm the exact same person
that you said that you loved.

28:58.060 --> 29:01.080
Yeah, I imagined this being
much more satisfying.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.000
The wig and the glasses.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.760
I mean, know people have their...
things, obsessions.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.440
Oh, yeah. Fetishes?
Whatever.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.760
It's just...it's not necessarily
something you can...you can control.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.400
Fuzz. You can't lecture me
about fetishes.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.200
Yeah, I know. I mean you,
you wrote all about them.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.280
I mean, come on, Miss,
guys in closets

29:22.340 --> 29:25.120
wearing rubber gloves and catsuits,
and I'm just...

29:25.180 --> 29:27.200
Fuzz, I don't care how old she is,

29:27.260 --> 29:30.840
and I know I've done a lot of
weird shit in a previous life.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.000
You know what?

29:39.060 --> 29:40.880
Shocking as it may seem,

29:40.940 --> 29:42.840
I feel like I've reached a point

29:42.900 --> 29:46.800
where I want someone
who just wants me.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.960
Fuck.

30:02.740 --> 30:06.320
So, I've just been trying to do
a deal with the DPP, right,

30:06.380 --> 30:08.960
but the government wants my seat
so they want me out.

30:09.020 --> 30:11.440
So, I'm basically looking
at three years in the slammer

30:11.500 --> 30:13.080
if I don't do a deal.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.400
But, if I plead guilty, that's
the end of my political career,

30:15.460 --> 30:18.040
so I'm basically fucked, mate,
I am fucked.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.440
To say nothing of the fact that
I'm about to lose a digit or two,

30:21.500 --> 30:24.560
so, Fuzzy, if you could possibly
see your way clear, mate,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.840
if you've got 90 lying around
in a sock drawer somewhere,

30:26.900 --> 30:29.000
now would be the time
to whip it out.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.280
Missy's playing mind games with me.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.920
Did you hear what I just said?

30:33.980 --> 30:37.520
Mate, I've made this observation
about your generation before,

30:37.580 --> 30:39.080
about listening.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.680
She was wearing a wig.

30:40.740 --> 30:42.960
I rest my case.
It was silvery grey.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.480
Fuck, mate.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.800
Well, a silvery grey wig, I mean,

30:46.860 --> 30:49.680
you'd like that, wouldn't you,
with your special needs.

30:49.740 --> 30:51.520
She had these glasses on.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.720
I always had a thing for women
in glasses.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.280
Oh, well, yeah, let's just have
a chat about that.

30:56.340 --> 30:59.880
Let's talk about that as opposed to,
the fact that your old man

30:59.940 --> 31:02.880
is going to end up back
in the fucking clink again.

31:02.940 --> 31:04.400
Sorry.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.120
Dad, she knows
I'm a Californian resident.

31:08.180 --> 31:11.360
She's probably freezing my assets
as we speak.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.960
Freezing your assets. Right, OK.

31:15.020 --> 31:20.640
So that...and that'd be where any
kind of potential loany thing

31:20.700 --> 31:22.200
might be coming from.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.640
Yeah. That's where the money is.
See, that's no good.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.760
I'm about to start shedding fingers.

31:30.300 --> 31:33.000
Alright, mate, I'll be back
in a jiffy. OK.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.760
This has to stop.
What?

31:36.820 --> 31:38.760
You can't punish Fuzz.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.600
Oh, I can't punish Fuzz?
No.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.120
On what basis would I
not want to punish Fuzz?

31:43.180 --> 31:44.560
Compassion.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.280
(LAUGHS) Compassion?

31:46.340 --> 31:48.840
Come on, come on,
I showed you compassion, haven't I,

31:48.900 --> 31:52.040
over the last years or so
when you've needed it.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.400
Cleave.
Yeah.

31:53.460 --> 31:56.240
I don't know if compassion
has really been the mixer

31:56.300 --> 31:58.280
in the cocktail of our relationship.

31:58.340 --> 32:01.120
You cannot freeze his US assets.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.360
That would be a disaster for him,
for you, for Winnie.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.680
I mean, that would put her
in a very vulnerable situation.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.960
Freeze his US assets?
I didn't even think of that.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.960
Well, good, because
that's a terrible idea.

32:13.020 --> 32:15.560
That would give me a lot
of bargaining power.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.200
Just let's turn the heat down.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.520
And now that he's a resident
of California,

32:19.580 --> 32:22.320
well, the courts are very
sympathetic to abandoned mothers.

32:22.380 --> 32:26.440
Come on! This is the father
of your beautiful daughter.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.080
Where's your humanity?

32:28.140 --> 32:30.240
How much do you need from him?

32:31.740 --> 32:32.920
90.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.320
Quickly.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.880
Look, Cleave, I don't want to
hurt him badly,

32:38.940 --> 32:41.600
but I think its only fair
that he feels some pain,

32:41.660 --> 32:45.000
and I've already spoken to a hotshot
lawyer in San Francisco.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.880
Oh, see, that's a terrible...
that's terrible...

32:46.940 --> 32:50.080
You don't need some smart-arse,
frisking prick coming in here,

32:50.140 --> 32:52.120
and stealing 40% of your income.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.560
It's a terrible idea.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.800
We're family,
we sort this shit out tonight.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.240
Come on!

32:57.300 --> 33:00.560
What...what sort of a split
are you after?

33:00.620 --> 33:02.880
70/30 his way,
current and future assets,

33:02.940 --> 33:05.320
and four grand a week maintenance.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.600
That's for rent, clothing,
schooling, holidays,

33:08.660 --> 33:10.800
everything Winnie needs
until she's 18.

33:10.860 --> 33:13.680
OK. I can't make any promises.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.600
50/50's what she's after, mate.

33:16.660 --> 33:20.520
50/50 on the assets, 10 grand
for Winnie until she's 25.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.200
10 fucking grand!
That's where we are.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.040
Are you...?
This is fucking bullshit.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.840
That's where she is, mate.
There's nothing I can do.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.480
I can do better in California.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.960
I'll get a fucking team of lawyers,
a fucking division of them.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.400
You think you could.
And she'll fucking pay me.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.280
No, no, don't talk like that.
Fuck!

33:34.340 --> 33:37.560
Listen, there's a chance it's just
a opening gambit, alright?

33:37.620 --> 33:40.040
Oh, mate, I'm finding this
too stressful.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.520
Yes, I can see that.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.640
If you can sort this out tonight...
Mm?

33:43.700 --> 33:45.800
..then I will look after you.

33:45.860 --> 33:47.480
Yeah.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.760
OK.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.280
Well, that's very kind, thank you.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.480
OK, well, what about we say

33:55.540 --> 33:59.920
something like 70/30
your way on the assets.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.040
Yep.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.800
Something like... (MUTTERS)

34:02.860 --> 34:07.720
..four grand for Winnie a week
until she finishes school.

34:07.780 --> 34:11.040
OK.
Yeah, mate, if you can do that.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.160
I'll try, I'll... No promises.
Oh, fuck.

34:14.220 --> 34:18.760
OK, he has reluctantly
accepted your terms.

34:18.820 --> 34:22.240
I have prepared a short form
memorandum of understanding.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.680
Both copies are in with Fuzz
as we speak.

34:24.740 --> 34:26.240
You should sign them tonight

34:26.300 --> 34:30.160
and I can get it into the proper
legal sewer on your behalf, OK?

34:30.220 --> 34:34.320
So, I will be needing my 90 grand,
pretty much tomorrow,

34:34.380 --> 34:40.360
and I would appreciate you backing me
up on that as a term of the MOU.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.160
Alright.

34:43.220 --> 34:44.320
Good.

34:44.380 --> 34:46.160
(CHUCKLES)

35:00.220 --> 35:02.760
Hey, what's going on?

35:04.220 --> 35:07.800
Oh, just putting out another one
of life's little spot fires.

35:07.860 --> 35:09.320
You're welcome.

35:09.380 --> 35:12.640
# Terry is a monkey
and he's very funky

35:12.700 --> 35:14.360
# Bopping in a tree... #

35:14.420 --> 35:17.680
Does he have to parade around
like a sex pest?

35:17.740 --> 35:20.320
Can we get him a full-length dress,
do you think?

35:20.380 --> 35:23.320
# Bananas, bananas
Let's go bananas... #

35:23.380 --> 35:25.360
Mate, nobody's laughing.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.880
# You and me... #

35:26.940 --> 35:28.960
(GROANING)
What's that?

35:29.020 --> 35:30.920
Is that Fuzz and Missy?

35:32.740 --> 35:36.440
What did you say to them?
What are they doing?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.080
What are they doing?

35:39.820 --> 35:43.120
Fuck off, Cleave.
Oh, are you done?

35:43.180 --> 35:45.280
(MISSY GROANS)

35:45.340 --> 35:47.240
(FUZZ GROANS)

35:47.300 --> 35:49.000
Oh, come on, that's dis...

35:49.060 --> 35:51.680
It's not...it's not a barn, you know.

35:51.740 --> 35:53.800
MISSY: Come!

35:57.740 --> 36:00.680
Oh, that's hilarious.

36:00.740 --> 36:03.440
(LAUGHS)
Oh, that's great, guys.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.440
Oh, I'm cacking myself.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.880
Great. Really fun.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.360
Where are my memoranda
of understanding?

36:09.420 --> 36:10.840
Why?
Because...

36:10.900 --> 36:12.400
Because it's your way of getting
90 grand?

36:12.460 --> 36:14.880
No, but there was more to it
than that.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.000
Well, what was it, Cleave,
because we don't want to sign it.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.600
We think that we can come to
an agreement on our own terms,

36:19.660 --> 36:21.920
in our own time,
if we even have to.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.920
We had a perfectly good,
functioning divorce going

36:24.980 --> 36:29.560
and you two have just
treated it with complete contempt.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.640
Also, I never asked for
a 50/50 split, Cleave.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.600
It was a negotiation, guys.
Neither of you is a lawyer.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.200
You were trying to shake us down.
That is...

36:39.260 --> 36:42.360
I wasn't asking for a gift from you,

36:42.420 --> 36:45.720
I was trying to get a loan, OK?

36:45.780 --> 36:48.000
From my own flesh and blood.

36:48.060 --> 36:51.080
A loan to you is a gift, Cleave.
Oh, too much to ask!

36:51.140 --> 36:52.160
Wow.

36:52.220 --> 36:54.360
Well, that's just lovely,

36:54.420 --> 36:59.440
And I'm glad you're both having
a good laugh and you're all so happy.

36:59.500 --> 37:03.320
Well, one thing's for sure -
you can say goodbye to this.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.640
Cleave, this isn't about you.

37:10.700 --> 37:13.240
Yes, it is. What do you mean,
it's about me?

37:13.300 --> 37:15.520
It's as much about me
as it is about you.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.120
You just think it's not about me

37:17.180 --> 37:19.160
because you think
it's just about you.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.480
Stop it.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.920
So, what, are you going to get
married or something?

37:22.980 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, we're going to have
a big white wedding,

37:26.060 --> 37:29.040
and we're going to have roses strewn
down the aisle

37:29.100 --> 37:32.520
and John Paul Young is hopefully
going to sing Love is in the Air,

37:32.580 --> 37:35.520
and there's going to be tulle
everywhere, especially on the men!

37:35.580 --> 37:37.960
Fine, so that's a no.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.680
He is your son.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.280
Mm?

37:44.460 --> 37:48.080
But I am happy, though.

37:48.140 --> 37:52.120
Really.
Yeah, scarily so.

37:52.180 --> 37:56.120
Well, good,
because you deserve to be.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.440
Yeah, I know I do.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.720
Checkmate.
What, no?

38:13.780 --> 38:14.840
Mm.
No!

38:14.900 --> 38:17.880
Oh.
What, that's, what, six moves?

38:17.940 --> 38:20.000
(LAUGHS)

38:21.300 --> 38:22.720
I'm very good at this game.

38:22.780 --> 38:25.240
Yeah, well, three games
in 20 minutes, I can tell.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.680
Mm.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.720
On our second date
I played with Cleaver

38:28.780 --> 38:30.440
and, um, I thrashed him so badly

38:30.500 --> 38:32.680
that he refused to ever
play me again.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.720
Why does that not surprise me?

38:35.780 --> 38:37.880
Do you want to play Scrabble?
Well, that depends.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.560
How good are you at Scrabble?

38:39.620 --> 38:41.400
I'm even better at Scrabble
than I am at chess.

38:41.460 --> 38:43.840
Really?
Especially if it's dirty Scrabble.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.160
Ah.

38:45.220 --> 38:46.840
Mm.
You want to play dirty Scrabble?

38:46.900 --> 38:49.760
Oh, my God, if I get a F and a K
and I play it on triple word,

38:49.820 --> 38:51.400
you are gone.

38:52.740 --> 38:56.480
So, um, does that mean
maybe tonight we will...

38:59.860 --> 39:03.360
It's been so nice kissing
and fooling around,

39:03.420 --> 39:06.200
and...you know,

39:06.260 --> 39:08.240
but we're not going to be a couple,
David.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.560
You know that.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.920
Yeah.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.440
It's just I've been looking after
other people my whole life,

39:15.500 --> 39:17.040
you know, I do it for a living,

39:17.100 --> 39:21.320
and I...I really need
to look after myself.

39:21.380 --> 39:23.920
And I can only do that on my own.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.000
And I know, I know that
there is someone out there for you

39:27.060 --> 39:28.840
and she will be amazing.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.600
And she will come out of nowhere
and she won't be a politician

39:32.660 --> 39:35.720
or a therapist or a call girl

39:35.780 --> 39:38.680
or a, you know, lawyer.

39:38.740 --> 39:41.040
She'll just be meant for you.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.120
And sincerely, my wish for you

39:45.180 --> 39:47.600
is that you can just surrender
to your life

39:47.660 --> 39:49.880
and fuck off the instruction manual.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.040
Well, me too.

40:02.140 --> 40:03.880
Evening.

40:03.940 --> 40:05.040
(GRUNTS)

40:07.220 --> 40:09.520
A couple of things...
Before you start.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.560
Just let me tell you this.

40:11.620 --> 40:16.280
You are an idiot for losing
that woman.

40:16.340 --> 40:18.000
Do you know that?
Oh.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.640
Oh, is that right, mate.
Oh, well, thanks...

40:19.700 --> 40:20.640
That's right.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.920
Oh, thanks for helping me out with
that. That's great.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.200
Here's a couple of things for you,
OK?

40:25.260 --> 40:28.920
If you're gonna be spending any
length of time in this house,

40:28.980 --> 40:32.800
I would appreciate it if you didn't
do it in Wendy's nighties, OK?

40:32.860 --> 40:37.000
'Cause I find that a little offensive
to mine eye, if you understand.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.520
Exactly why did you give her up?

40:38.580 --> 40:40.440
Mate, that's my business.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.320
Was it for fun?
I'm a free spirit.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.040
You wouldn't understand...
You know what?

40:44.100 --> 40:46.040
Such a fuckin' old...
Free spirit!

40:46.100 --> 40:47.440
Do you know what?
I'm like Bowie...

40:47.500 --> 40:49.480
If that is being you...
..or Marley...

40:49.540 --> 40:52.040
..I don't want to be you.

40:52.100 --> 40:56.000
Mate, you couldn't be me
if your fuckin' life depended on it.

40:56.060 --> 40:57.800
Look at you!
Look at me?

40:57.860 --> 40:59.520
And then look at me, alright?

40:59.580 --> 41:02.280
That's why you couldn't be me
Is that right?

41:02.340 --> 41:05.000
Yeah, regrettably, you are you.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.320
Do you know what you are?

41:06.380 --> 41:09.120
You're a dirty ibis.
You are a human turd.

41:09.180 --> 41:11.120
Mate, you're a fuckin' turd.

41:13.460 --> 41:15.200
(GRUNTS)
Get out of here!

41:15.260 --> 41:16.920
Oh, mate, I've got a lot of this!

41:16.980 --> 41:18.160
I've got a lot of this.

41:18.220 --> 41:19.960
You certainly do have a lot.

41:20.020 --> 41:20.960
Turd! Turd!
Turd!

41:26.580 --> 41:28.120
(GROANS)

41:28.180 --> 41:29.920
Are they really that delicate?

41:29.980 --> 41:33.320
Are you fucking...kidding me?

41:33.380 --> 41:36.040
Oh...oh...

41:36.100 --> 41:38.160
Oh, God.

41:38.220 --> 41:40.920
You know, I really need a drink.

41:40.980 --> 41:44.600
Oh, see, now you really
sound like me.

41:48.300 --> 41:52.840
So, new Parliament House,

41:52.900 --> 41:56.880
by which I mean the former
Parliament House...

41:56.940 --> 41:58.160
What?

41:58.220 --> 42:02.080
You're on the committee of inquiry,
aren't you?

42:02.140 --> 42:03.120
Yes, yeah.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.080
How they gained access,
whatever shit they used,

42:05.140 --> 42:07.800
but, you know, the science isn't
easy, so...

42:07.860 --> 42:11.320
See, I think shit might be
the operative word.

42:11.380 --> 42:12.560
What do you mean?

42:12.620 --> 42:17.480
Well, I have a feeling the whole
thing might have been about poo.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.440
Poo?

42:19.500 --> 42:21.320
Poo.

42:21.380 --> 42:22.720
Why do you say that?

42:22.780 --> 42:26.600
Well, you know those two plumbers
who died?

42:26.660 --> 42:28.360
The ones who drowned?
Mm.

42:28.420 --> 42:32.440
They came to my place a while back
and they did a bit of work,

42:32.500 --> 42:35.080
and they were interesting guys
and we got to talking.

42:35.140 --> 42:39.560
And they were sent in
under the tarp,

42:39.620 --> 42:41.840
and then a short time later...

42:41.900 --> 42:43.840
(CLICKS TONGUE)

42:43.900 --> 42:45.440
Why have you sat on this?

42:45.500 --> 42:48.200
Well, because they're dead now,

42:48.260 --> 42:51.840
which puts us in a very tricky
position in terms of evidence,

42:51.900 --> 42:55.000
and because it's me
and nobody's going to believe me.

42:55.060 --> 42:56.320
That's true.

42:56.380 --> 42:59.160
And if I'm right,
I don't want to fuck it up.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.480
But that's where you come in.

43:01.540 --> 43:05.800
So, your theory is that this was
basically sloppy maintenance

43:05.860 --> 43:10.120
made to look like a terrorist
attack for political purposes?

43:11.340 --> 43:13.720
That's the theory.
Christ.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.920
My committee doesn't sit
for another month.

43:17.980 --> 43:19.720
Even then, without witnesses...

43:19.780 --> 43:21.720
I mean, we're talking about two,

43:21.780 --> 43:24.160
possibly three prime ministers
lying.

43:24.220 --> 43:25.400
Mm-hm.

43:25.460 --> 43:27.400
Well, how do we get it out there?
Here's the thing.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.760
I was thinking my creche case.

43:30.820 --> 43:34.240
What's the relevance?
Mate, it's me.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.800
Huh?

43:36.900 --> 43:39.280
You representing yourself?
Yes.

43:39.340 --> 43:42.640
But I'm going to need your backup.

43:42.700 --> 43:43.920
OK?

43:43.980 --> 43:47.840
And I'd sort out a reliable old enemy

43:47.900 --> 43:50.720
to represent Nicole and her mum.

43:53.260 --> 43:59.040
We are all children of someone, are
we not? Of lesser or greater gods.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.840
As seven-year-olds,

44:00.900 --> 44:05.040
we all looked upon our futures
assuming a rosy disposition.

44:05.100 --> 44:08.440
Why should life turn grey
and thorny?

44:09.860 --> 44:15.320
One of the beauties of life
is understanding myriad pricks...

44:16.420 --> 44:19.520
..maintain a majestic pink rose...

44:19.580 --> 44:22.560
Miss Huntley-Brown,
is there a point

44:22.620 --> 44:24.760
that your argument is searching for?

44:24.820 --> 44:27.160
Well, with the greatest respect,
Your Honour,

44:27.220 --> 44:31.160
there is a question of context,
which I'm sure you would appreciate.

44:31.220 --> 44:33.280
Not quite yet, no.

44:33.340 --> 44:34.280
Really?

44:34.340 --> 44:36.920
The concept of governments
hiding the truth

44:36.980 --> 44:40.280
is as ancient as the concept
of government itself.

44:40.340 --> 44:46.000
Your Honour, a shabby blue tarpaulin
has shrouded our national parliament

44:46.060 --> 44:47.720
for some months,

44:47.780 --> 44:50.800
and that is not just a metaphor,
that is a deceit.

44:50.860 --> 44:51.880
Miss Huntley-Brown,

44:51.940 --> 44:56.600
what has that got to do with a case
about the misuse of public funds

44:56.660 --> 44:58.560
regarding an office in Sydney?

44:59.740 --> 45:01.640
I will see counsel in my chambers.

45:01.700 --> 45:02.760
All rise.

45:03.820 --> 45:06.360
What the fuck is going on, Hunter?

45:06.420 --> 45:08.480
I'll tell you what's going on.

45:08.540 --> 45:11.120
There's a giant blue condom
hanging over our parliament.

45:11.180 --> 45:13.760
Forgive me, but I can't see
the connection.

45:13.820 --> 45:16.240
If something horrible is happening
to Parliament House,

45:16.300 --> 45:18.720
and it clearly is,
that is deeply regrettable.

45:18.780 --> 45:21.920
But what has it got to do
with this case?

45:21.980 --> 45:25.240
Reggie, the government is trying to
cover up its own negligence.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.040
Their efforts to silence

45:27.100 --> 45:30.920
Senator Greene and Senator Potter's
committee of inquiry and their staff

45:30.980 --> 45:32.600
is beyond sinister.

45:32.660 --> 45:37.080
The dead plumbers - do you really
believe that was an accident?

45:37.140 --> 45:38.320
What?!

45:39.740 --> 45:43.640
I don't know how to express
myself more clearly.

45:43.700 --> 45:47.960
I do not want this argument
going on!

45:48.020 --> 45:50.480
It is irrelevant!

45:52.100 --> 45:54.240
I'm going to have to excuse myself.

46:01.420 --> 46:03.080
Very nice.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.840
Ah, Your Honour.
Senator.

46:16.100 --> 46:18.600
Oh, Senator.
Senator Potter.

46:18.660 --> 46:20.120
Your Honour.

46:21.420 --> 46:24.960
The passing of the Chief Justice
is a great blow to us all.

46:25.020 --> 46:26.840
Indeed.

46:26.900 --> 46:29.720
I'm not sure if you're aware,
Your Honour,

46:29.780 --> 46:31.680
that Senator Potter here is a member

46:31.740 --> 46:33.680
of the Senate Judicial
Advisory Committee

46:33.740 --> 46:36.080
with the responsibility of
advising the Attorney-General

46:36.140 --> 46:39.360
and, er, judicial appointments.

46:39.420 --> 46:42.760
You went to university
with the Attorney, didn't you?

46:42.820 --> 46:44.800
Well, I certainly did.

46:44.860 --> 46:47.200
Well, just out of curiosity,
has the, er...

46:47.260 --> 46:49.840
Has the Attorney
indicated any replacement

46:49.900 --> 46:51.480
for the late Chief Justice?

46:51.540 --> 46:55.320
Ah...no.
But there is a short list.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.320
Um...

46:57.500 --> 46:59.520
Changing the subject completely,

46:59.580 --> 47:03.920
I've prepared what might be
described as an amicus brief...

47:03.980 --> 47:05.520
for Senator Greene.

47:05.580 --> 47:09.400
Background information
that were he allowed to tender

47:09.460 --> 47:13.160
might prove useful
in these proceedings.

47:14.260 --> 47:15.600
I see.

47:17.020 --> 47:18.320
Right.

47:19.740 --> 47:22.840
And what about the matter
of relevance?

47:22.900 --> 47:24.160
How do I deal with that?

47:24.220 --> 47:26.240
Oh, well, look, Your Honour,

47:26.300 --> 47:29.320
in the unlikely event
it should prove irrelevant,

47:29.380 --> 47:32.760
you could always instruct the jury
to disregard it.

47:32.820 --> 47:34.720
Yeah, yeah, I could do that.

47:34.780 --> 47:37.120
In the interests of justice.

47:37.180 --> 47:38.480
Oh...

47:38.540 --> 47:40.920
Your Honour.
Your Honour.

47:42.940 --> 47:46.520
Your Honour, the attempts
by this government

47:46.580 --> 47:49.240
to silence me and my staff

47:49.300 --> 47:53.240
have reached...such
an egregious level,

47:53.300 --> 47:56.160
that they now want to lock us up
for looking after children.

47:56.220 --> 47:59.880
That is what government
has become in this country.

47:59.940 --> 48:04.000
If your enemies won't shut up,
lock them up for pastoral care.

48:04.060 --> 48:08.720
Quite frankly, Your Honour, after
repeated attempts on my life...

48:08.780 --> 48:11.440
..I feel quite lucky
to be standing here.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.640
Objection, Your Honour!

48:13.700 --> 48:17.000
This is entirely irrelevant.

48:21.740 --> 48:22.960
Overruled.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.480
You may continue, Senator Greene.

48:31.060 --> 48:32.960
Thank you, Your Honour.

48:33.020 --> 48:39.560
Your Honour, there was no terrorist
attack on Parliament House.

48:39.620 --> 48:42.640
It was quite simply a matter
of poor plumbing.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.760
Holy fucking camole!

48:44.820 --> 48:46.320
See, I told you he'd get it in.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.080
We have to shut this troll down.

48:48.140 --> 48:49.960
Get the DPP to end it.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.280
On what grounds?

48:51.340 --> 48:53.000
On whatever grounds
you can come up with.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.720
Martians have invaded.
I don't give a shit.

48:54.780 --> 48:56.160
That's why he's got the job.

48:56.220 --> 48:59.000
If he wants the job...
And the serious option?

49:01.460 --> 49:03.760
Can we risk it?

49:03.820 --> 49:05.320
Two plumbers are already dead.

49:05.380 --> 49:06.680
Well, that had nothing to do
with me.

49:06.740 --> 49:09.960
You knew about it.
We need to implode Parliament House.

49:10.020 --> 49:12.520
Implode? What?!

49:13.900 --> 49:15.200
Not on my watch.

49:15.260 --> 49:18.880
Cal, at some point, the tarp is
going to have to come off,

49:18.940 --> 49:22.520
and some scientists that have been
stripped of government funding

49:22.580 --> 49:24.640
are going to go in there
and quickly discover

49:24.700 --> 49:26.320
there was no act of terrorism,

49:26.380 --> 49:28.000
just some dodgy fucking plumbing.

49:28.060 --> 49:32.080
So we say that in order to
preserve the water table...

49:32.140 --> 49:33.960
No, we say...

49:34.020 --> 49:37.200
..in order to preserve the city
of Canberra,

49:37.260 --> 49:40.280
that that Parliament House,
built under Labor's watch,

49:40.340 --> 49:42.000
is so toxic
because of the terrorists,

49:42.060 --> 49:44.040
it has to come down.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.960
And we get to build a new one.

49:47.020 --> 49:48.800
Thousands of jobs.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.160
Ta-da!

49:51.780 --> 49:53.360
I get to save Canberra.

49:54.980 --> 49:56.840
And build a new parliament.

49:56.900 --> 49:59.400
Yes, Prime Minister, you do.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.560
Well, what about Greene.
What about Potter?

50:01.620 --> 50:02.800
How do we shut them up?

50:02.860 --> 50:04.520
Potter'll shut up if we up
the refugee budget

50:04.580 --> 50:06.640
by, say, I don't know, 200 million.

50:06.700 --> 50:08.400
200 mill? Christ!

50:09.500 --> 50:12.800
Yeah, OK, OK, we can do that.

50:12.860 --> 50:14.480
Greene?

50:16.380 --> 50:17.720
We're not thinking...

50:18.740 --> 50:20.320
How can we?

50:20.380 --> 50:24.200
I mean, will any of us ever know
sleep again if we do such a thing?

50:24.260 --> 50:26.040
It's either that...

50:27.420 --> 50:29.240
..or we have to kill him.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.280
JAKUB: Please, allow me.

50:40.340 --> 50:42.080
Oh...

50:47.740 --> 50:49.320
Ah.

50:50.340 --> 50:52.240
Ah, thank you, mate.

50:52.300 --> 50:54.320
(THUD!)
Orgh!

50:54.380 --> 50:55.560
God!

50:55.620 --> 50:58.440
Oh, mate! Why did you...?

50:58.500 --> 51:01.080
Mate, I gave you 100 grand
from under my mattress.

51:01.140 --> 51:02.880
Well, there's still another 80.

51:02.940 --> 51:05.280
This will buy us more time
with my people.

51:05.340 --> 51:06.920
I've got bandages.

51:09.580 --> 51:10.960
Hey.

51:12.580 --> 51:14.280
Hi.
Um...

51:14.340 --> 51:16.560
I've got you a present.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.320
Oh.

51:20.340 --> 51:21.840
Oh, wow.

51:27.140 --> 51:29.600
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, good.

51:29.660 --> 51:32.040
Um, I, um...

51:32.100 --> 51:34.320
I just, um...you know,

51:34.380 --> 51:39.200
it was really important to me that
I acknowledge your resilience,

51:39.260 --> 51:40.520
you know,

51:40.580 --> 51:43.120
and your tenacity, and...

51:44.500 --> 51:46.800
..and our long complicated history
together.

51:46.860 --> 51:48.440
And it is history, you know.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.000
And...

51:50.060 --> 51:53.480
Oh, God, I haven't done this
for so long. Um...

51:54.540 --> 51:56.960
But I loved you very much, you know,

51:57.020 --> 52:01.280
and we made a beautiful,
complicated young man together,

52:01.340 --> 52:02.720
and...

52:03.900 --> 52:06.400
..I just really want you to know
that, despite all the nonsense,

52:06.460 --> 52:07.960
I don't regret a minute of it.

52:09.540 --> 52:11.760
It just looks...
That looks terrible.

52:12.900 --> 52:14.960
No, it's beautiful.

52:34.140 --> 52:35.800
Hey.

52:37.900 --> 52:40.680
Hey. (CLUCKS TONGUE)

52:40.740 --> 52:42.520
G'day, mate.

52:42.580 --> 52:43.880
Hello, puss.
(MIAOWS)

52:43.940 --> 52:45.160
Oh!

52:48.100 --> 52:50.200
Hello, mate.

52:52.740 --> 52:55.080
Princess!
(LAUGHS)

52:56.020 --> 52:57.600
How?!

52:57.660 --> 53:00.160
See, I've been getting up early,
mate,

53:00.220 --> 53:01.440
and going searching

53:01.500 --> 53:03.800
and she just ran straight
into my arms.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.560
I mean, she loves me.

53:06.780 --> 53:08.600
You have a cuddle. I'll drive.

53:08.660 --> 53:11.320
No, no, no, I'll drive.

53:11.380 --> 53:13.160
Oh, no. Well, I...

53:13.220 --> 53:14.560
Happy to drive...

53:14.620 --> 53:16.480
Hap... (SNEEZES)

53:24.780 --> 53:26.760
Oh, mate.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.400
Hey, Cleaver.

53:28.460 --> 53:29.960
I'm thinking...

53:31.780 --> 53:34.640
..don't worry about
the remaining 80 grand.

53:34.700 --> 53:36.000
It's forgiven.

53:37.060 --> 53:41.160
All I really wanted
was to have my Princess back.

53:41.220 --> 53:42.640
Great.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.360
Thanks, mate. Good on you.

53:48.940 --> 53:52.800
I, Cleaver Augustus Greene

53:52.860 --> 53:56.520
do swear allegiance to
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,

53:56.580 --> 53:59.640
her heirs and successors,
according to law,

53:59.700 --> 54:04.400
that I will well and truly serve
her and her successors

54:04.460 --> 54:08.640
in the office of Chief Justice
of the High Court of Australia,

54:08.700 --> 54:12.440
and that I will do right to all
manner of people according to law,

54:12.500 --> 54:15.640
without fear or favour,

54:15.700 --> 54:19.000
affection or ill will,

54:19.060 --> 54:21.200
so help me God.

54:25.340 --> 54:30.640
It's against the law to finger the
Chief Justice's robes in this way.

54:30.700 --> 54:32.960
It's man-made, isn't it?
Hands off, OK?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.920
Hey.
Ah, yes.

54:34.980 --> 54:38.600
Mmm. Jesus Christ on a bicycle.

54:38.660 --> 54:41.280
Yes, isn't he just?

54:41.340 --> 54:43.640
There we go then.
Yes.

54:44.820 --> 54:47.440
Congratulations, Cleaver.
Oh, well, thank you, mate.

54:47.500 --> 54:50.480
You know I own your arse now.

54:50.540 --> 54:55.200
Oh, Cal, you've always been
a shit lawyer, haven't you?

54:55.260 --> 54:59.960
Because I'm Chief Justice,
so I own YOUR arse.

55:17.620 --> 55:19.320
(SNEEZES)

55:19.380 --> 55:23.320
So, uh, what's on the agenda today,
Jakub?

55:24.380 --> 55:27.320
Well, you have this case,
Button and Dean.

55:27.380 --> 55:30.080
I could walk you through it.
Is it a yes or a no?

55:30.140 --> 55:31.880
Definitely a no.

55:32.820 --> 55:35.360
Then there's one involving my union

55:35.420 --> 55:38.360
and whether we have
over-exercised our rights

55:38.420 --> 55:40.880
in terms of subcontracting.

55:40.940 --> 55:43.280
That's a no as well, I take it.

55:43.340 --> 55:46.200
In terms of equity, yes,
Mr Chief Justice.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.000
But you're the judge.

55:57.740 --> 55:59.560
(EXPLOSION)

56:22.740 --> 56:25.080
Feel like a dip?
OK, darling.

56:25.140 --> 56:26.480
Mmm.

56:37.300 --> 56:39.000
Madame.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.360
Oh, God!
Are you OK?

57:00.420 --> 57:03.320
(SHOUTS)

57:03.380 --> 57:05.320
Um, it's... Oh, hey?

57:05.380 --> 57:06.600
Get them off me!

57:06.660 --> 57:09.080
Can we get a little bit of help
over here?

57:09.140 --> 57:12.240
The Chief Justice of Australia,
just so you know!

57:12.300 --> 57:13.680
They're not coming off!

57:13.740 --> 57:15.880
Oh, my God, well,
can you just shake your face?

57:15.940 --> 57:18.040
What, shut your face? Why?

57:18.100 --> 57:19.640
Just shake your face.

57:19.700 --> 57:20.960
Oh, my God!

57:21.020 --> 57:23.200
There's one almost in your ear.

57:23.260 --> 57:24.600
Oh, God!
