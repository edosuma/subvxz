00:49.282 --> 00:51.750
<i>...is not the only
such affliction.</i>

00:51.752 --> 00:53.786
<i>And so we come
to that condition</i>

00:53.788 --> 00:55.654
<i>which most often afflicts
the more nervous sex.</i>

00:55.656 --> 00:58.090
Hysteria.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.259
Derived from the Greek
for "uterus".

01:00.261 --> 01:02.594
Much studied
by the French,

01:02.596 --> 01:06.198
it has of late
come under the scrutiny
of our Austrian colleagues.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.569
Tonight, we'll endeavor
to add a British accent
to this chorus.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.337
Bring in
the patient, please.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.216
As you can see,

01:24.218 --> 01:28.153
the patient
is a comely woman
of five and thirty years

01:28.155 --> 01:30.756
who has been under my care
at Bethlehem Hospital.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.159
Of impeccable breeding,
she has suffered much
of her life

01:34.161 --> 01:36.795
from the classic symptoms
of the chronic hysteric.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.464
Who can tell me
what these are?

01:38.466 --> 01:39.631
Lassitude?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.233
Correct.
Another.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.734
The tingling
of the extremities.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.504
Yes.
Another.
Convulsions.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.739
Sometimes called
"hysteric fits",

01:47.741 --> 01:50.542
during which the patient
may become violent,

01:50.544 --> 01:52.544
<i>dangerously unmanageable.</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:54.480
<i>Which is why,
as a precautionary measure,</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:58.517
I've had her injected
with four grains
of heroin.

01:58.519 --> 02:03.388
<i>One cannot be too careful</i>
<i>when attempting to trigger</i>
<i>a fit in a clinical setting.</i>

02:03.390 --> 02:06.425
As I shall now
endeavor to do.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.494
<i>Please.</i>

02:08.496 --> 02:11.196
I beseech you, sir,
do not.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.731
Shh, shh, shh.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.766
<i>The trigger point...</i>
Help me.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.169
Help me.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.804
One of you, please.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.439
<i>Look at me.</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:21.840
<i>I am not mad.</i>

02:21.842 --> 02:24.910
I am not mad.
Look at me.

02:24.912 --> 02:29.515
<i>The trigger point</i>
<i>may be hidden anywhere</i>
<i>in the female anatomy.</i>

02:29.517 --> 02:32.317
<i>Most often
upon the breasts.</i>

02:32.319 --> 02:34.199
Do not touch me.
The inner thighs.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.458
Or the ovaries.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.700
Note the clenched fists,
the arched back,

02:50.603 --> 02:52.643
the tonic
and clonic spasms.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.440
Concluding finally

02:57.710 --> 03:00.070
in a profound
contracture.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.516
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

03:04.518 --> 03:06.451
She's started
her monthly bleeding.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.854
Next patient, please.
Bring in the patient.

03:08.856 --> 03:13.425
Any questions?
What of the woman's insistence
that she is not mad?

03:13.427 --> 03:16.295
Just as every criminal
maintains he's innocent,

03:16.297 --> 03:18.864
so does every mad woman
insist she is sane.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.201
But she seemed so...
Reasonable?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.702
Perhaps.
Well bred?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.837
Beautiful?

03:25.839 --> 03:28.440
She is all these things.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.444
<i>And quite mad.</i>

03:37.250 --> 03:39.751
<i>And therein lies
the paradox of insanity</i>

03:39.753 --> 03:42.588
<i>and the great peril
of our profession.</i>

03:42.590 --> 03:45.857
<i>Thus, I caution
you all, gentlemen,</i>

03:45.859 --> 03:48.539
<i>as you embark</i>
<i>on your careers</i>
<i>as alienists,</i>

03:50.630 --> 03:53.365
<i>believe nothing
that you hear</i>

03:53.367 --> 03:55.834
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

04:12.819 --> 04:14.486
Bloody hell.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.940
Hey!
Wait!

04:34.942 --> 04:37.709
Hello there.
Excuse me.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.878
I beg you, stop.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.580
<i>At first,
Da didn't want to stop</i>

04:41.582 --> 04:43.815
on account you may be
a lunatic who escaped,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.984
<i>but I convinced him
you couldn't be</i>

04:45.986 --> 04:48.820
since you're headed
toward the madhouse
and not away from it.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.323
Ah, clever deduction.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.059
And you look like a man
who's only lost his way,
not his mind.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.995
Well, I'm grateful.
Thank you.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.731
<i>Are you visiting
someone at Stonehearst?</i>

04:59.733 --> 05:02.333
<i>Actually, going there</i>
<i>to complete my training</i>
<i>as an alienist.</i>

05:04.570 --> 05:07.806
<i>That's a doctor</i>
<i>who specializes</i>
<i>in asylum medicine.</i>

05:07.808 --> 05:09.675
<i>Well, I can tell
you'll be a good one.</i>

05:09.677 --> 05:12.044
You have kind eyes.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.446
Aw, thank you.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.596
The madhouse
is just up that hill.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.965
You're certain?
Oh, yes.
Look!

05:37.437 --> 05:39.771
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

05:41.675 --> 05:43.342
Merry Christmas.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.152
Hello?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.596
Hello!

06:44.971 --> 06:47.706
And who the feck
might you be?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.976
Ah, good God.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.780
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm-I'm Edward Newgate.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.449
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.721
Might-Might you let me in?

07:02.723 --> 07:06.091
Well, now, that depends.
Were we expecting you?

07:06.093 --> 07:10.629
Well, I hope so.
I did send a letter
to the superintendent here.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.865
<i>Must have been
weeks ago now.</i>

07:13.867 --> 07:16.835
Well, the post
isn't regular
this time of the year.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.105
Oh, really? I...

07:26.512 --> 07:29.514
I'm just acting the maggot.
Of course you can
come in, Ted.

07:29.516 --> 07:33.585
What kind of Christian would
I be to leave another outside
to freeze his onions off?

07:33.587 --> 07:36.087
And on Christmas Eve
no less.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.524
Well, thank you so much.
I-I do appreciate it.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.094
My name's Finn.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.764
I'm the chief steward.

07:45.766 --> 07:49.734
Welcome to our
little madhouse
in the wilderness.

07:59.078 --> 08:03.748
Presently we have
200 residents
at Stonehearst.

08:03.750 --> 08:08.153
Sons and daughters
of some of the finest
families in the realm.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.656
We have lords, dukes.
We even have a cousin
of the Queen.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.025
Now, she likes
to finger paint
with her own shite.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.161
There you go, Rosie.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.930
We have a viscount
who's convinced
he has two heads,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.967
and an earl
who thinks
he's a teapot.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.735
Seriously.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.540
Wait-Wait here.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.709
The doctor
will be along shortly.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.778
Right, yes.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.847
<i>Trephination.</i>

09:42.849 --> 09:45.183
An arcane
medical procedure
performed by savages

09:45.185 --> 09:47.886
<i>upon those possessed
of evil spirits.</i>

09:47.888 --> 09:50.055
By boring a hole
in the skull,

09:50.057 --> 09:55.660
they believed
it would allow
the demons to escape.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.697
Let us be thankful we live
in more enlightened times,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.799
don't you agree,
doctor...?

10:00.801 --> 10:04.336
Newgate.
Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.905
Forgive me
for turning up
unannounced.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.609
I did write a letter.
It's just your Mr. Finn
tells me it never arrived.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.611
An Oxford man
is always welcome here.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.815
So,

10:18.651 --> 10:20.652
what brings you
to Stonehearst?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.387
Well, as I wrote
in my letter,

10:22.389 --> 10:24.389
I had hoped
I would observe
your methods in or...

10:24.391 --> 10:26.625
Oh, no, thank you.
Nonsense.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.293
You've had
an arduous voyage.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.261
From the backwaters
of blissful ignorance

10:30.263 --> 10:33.164
across vast oceans
of academic blather

10:33.166 --> 10:35.734
until at last
you've arrived here,

10:35.736 --> 10:37.096
on the shores
of my little kingdom.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.740
And at the dawn
of a new century,
no less.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.657
So,

10:58.659 --> 11:00.825
it's asylum medicine
you wish to practice.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.763
Uh, yes, since as long
as I can remember.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.332
Why?
I'm sorry?

11:07.334 --> 11:11.703
Why not some specialty
that's held in higher regard?
Surgery, for instance.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.805
I don't much care
for blood, I suppose.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.841
Tropical medicine then.
Or problems of the female
anatomy.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.877
<i>Both offer better pay.</i>

11:23.783 --> 11:27.018
Well, I've always
been fascinated
by the troubled mind.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.256
So is a priest
but he at least
is guaranteed heaven.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.358
<i>What do you hope
to gain?</i>

11:38.030 --> 11:41.933
The satisfaction
of helping those
in hell.

11:44.303 --> 11:48.473
<i>See, of all the afflictions,
I can think of none more,</i>

11:48.475 --> 11:50.975
more cruel
than madness, sir.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.846
<i>See, it robs a man
of his reason,</i>

11:54.848 --> 11:57.816
<i>his dignity,
his very soul.</i>

11:57.818 --> 11:59.250
And it does so,

12:01.353 --> 12:05.123
so slowly,
without the remorse
of death.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.493
<i>Please, sir.</i>

12:08.495 --> 12:11.463
I have the desire
and the training.

12:11.465 --> 12:14.705
All I lack
is the clinical
experience.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.812
Time for afternoon rounds.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.881
Of course.
I didn't wish
to keep you...

12:29.883 --> 12:32.951
Join me, Doctor.
Thank you.

12:32.953 --> 12:37.155
Mr. Finn,
help the doctor off
with his coat, would you?

12:45.364 --> 12:48.099
Thank you.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.935
<i>You'll find us well-stocked
with the usual cases.</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:53.238
Neurasthenia,
dementia praecox,

12:53.240 --> 12:56.908
incurable homosexuality,
epilepsy, melancholia.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.810
But where we differ
from other asylums

12:58.812 --> 13:01.813
is in the social station
of our patients.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.448
All hail
from the finest
families in Europe.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.950
For instance,
Terrance here

13:05.952 --> 13:08.386
is heir to one
of the largest railroad
fortunes in the continent.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.388
And what is the nature
of his disorder?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.824
He suffers
from an utter lack
of interest in trains.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.325
So his family
had him committed?

13:14.327 --> 13:16.961
Interesting case
this one.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.565
Signore Balzoni was thrown
from his horse during a polo
match in Milan

13:20.567 --> 13:23.434
<i>and ever since</i>
<i>he's believed himself</i>
<i>to be an Arabian stallion.</i>

13:25.238 --> 13:29.274
He gets a tad agitated
at feeding times.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.409
Please go ahead.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.582
You'll find most
of our patients are here

13:37.584 --> 13:40.218
because they are
embarrassments
to their families.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.419
Outcasts.

13:43.422 --> 13:47.091
Signore,
give the gentleman
his arm back

13:47.093 --> 13:50.333
or I shall be forced
to withhold grooming
for a week.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.165
You-You groom him?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.836
Small price to pay
to keep him contented.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.272
Isn't that reinforcing
his delusion?
Yes.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.042
What, you don't attempt
to cure your patients?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.878
Cure them?
To what purpose?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.480
Well, to bring them back
to their senses, of course.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.084
And make a miserable man
out of a perfectly happy
horse.

14:19.558 --> 14:22.393
<i>Madame.
Your Eminence.</i>

14:22.395 --> 14:24.629
Is it always
this lively?

14:24.631 --> 14:27.966
Here we do not believe
in sedating our patients

14:27.968 --> 14:30.501
into a stupor
with bromides
and the like.

14:30.503 --> 14:35.006
<i>We prefer to celebrate them</i>
<i>in their natural unadulterated</i>
<i>state.</i>

14:37.276 --> 14:38.476
Check.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.881
Mm.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.283
Good afternoon, my lovely.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.653
<i>Nurse.
Nurse?</i>

14:48.655 --> 14:51.656
Has she eaten today?

14:51.658 --> 14:56.227
She refuses to eat
until her son returns
from the war.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.931
He was killed in action
in Peshawar, '85.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.300
Have you tried
a feeding tube?

15:07.239 --> 15:09.974
We do not use such
medieval methods here.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.011
I'd hardly
call it "medieval".

15:13.013 --> 15:14.646
What would you
call it then?

15:14.648 --> 15:17.215
Well, a necessary means
of preventing death.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.050
Death cannot be
prevented, Doctor,

15:19.052 --> 15:21.052
any more
than madness cured.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.221
<i>There's no cure
for the human condition.</i>

15:23.223 --> 15:25.543
And it's a foolish
physician who tries.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.264
<i>Suppose I were</i>
<i>to present you</i>
<i>with the following case.</i>

15:33.266 --> 15:35.934
A woman who suffers
from violent fits

15:35.936 --> 15:38.970
triggered by physical
or emotional contact

15:38.972 --> 15:42.307
that she perceives
to be of too intimate
a nature.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.108
Ah, sounds
like hysteria.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.311
What treatment
would you prescribe?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.947
Ah, mustard packs,
I should think.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.182
Is she a patient
or a pickled herring?

15:51.184 --> 15:54.252
Pelvic massage?
Potassium bromide?

15:54.254 --> 15:57.355
<i>I'm interested</i>
<i>in your opinion, Doctor,</i>
<i>not some textbook's.</i>

15:57.357 --> 16:01.025
Forget bromides.
Open your eyes.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.961
Look at her.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.602
So, I ask you again,

16:11.604 --> 16:15.106
presented with a woman
of utmost grace
and refinement

16:15.108 --> 16:18.076
within whose breast
roils passion so great

16:18.078 --> 16:20.445
she fears
they will destroy her,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.607
what treatment
would you prescribe?

16:27.553 --> 16:29.387
Music.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.223
Three times
a day, no less.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.493
Bravo, Doctor.
I concur.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.397
There are few therapies
better at restoring
the soul than music.

16:39.399 --> 16:43.134
<i>Her name</i>
<i>is Lady Charles Graves.</i>
<i>Eliza. Mrs. Graves to us.</i>

16:43.136 --> 16:45.136
<i>I presume you know
her husband?</i>

16:45.138 --> 16:47.672
No.
Repugnant chap.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.241
<i>Possesses
a tremendous fortune.</i>

16:50.243 --> 16:54.579
Not to mention
many unnatural
appetites.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.416
<i>As one would expect,</i>
<i>her hysterical episodes</i>
<i>worsened</i>

16:58.418 --> 17:01.119
<i>following the engagement,</i>
<i>until one night she bit off</i>
<i>his ear</i>

17:01.121 --> 17:04.255
<i>and gouged out
his eye with a comb.</i>

17:04.257 --> 17:06.790
So her husband
had her committed.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.393
<i>No, her father.</i>

17:08.395 --> 17:10.194
If it had been up
to the Baronet,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.530
she'd still be at home
in his loving embrace.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.532
In fact, not a week goes by
that I don't receive a letter
from him

17:15.535 --> 17:18.102
<i>threatening me</i>
<i>and demanding</i>
<i>I declare her cured</i>

17:18.104 --> 17:20.137
so she might be remanded
into his custody.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.673
So, you refuse?

17:22.675 --> 17:25.410
For her own safety.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.459
Come, Doctor.
Yes, of course.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.562
We have much to see
before dinner.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.647
May I just say
that your playing
is sublime.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.718
Oh.
Oh, your playing
is sublime.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.688
It's quite sublime.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.492
I'm Newgate.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.862
Dr. Edward Newgate.
My name is Edward Newgate.
Doc...

19:12.718 --> 19:14.685
Nurse.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.420
May I have
a glass of water?

19:16.422 --> 19:18.289
Yes, ma'am.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.468
Your playing
is sublime.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.871
What was that,
Mozart, Beethoven?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.940
No, I wrote it.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.610
Of course.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.346
Let me introduce myself.
My name is...
Dr. Newgate.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.683
I know.
We don't receive
many visitors here.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.486
We're rather
like a leper colony.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.856
Well, I doubt lepers
are so charming.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.758
<i>I wish you would stop
complimenting me.</i>

19:53.760 --> 19:56.761
It makes me
uncomfortable.
Forgive me, Mrs. Graves.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.596
The last thing
I wish to do
is offend you.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.333
Are you quite certain
you're a doctor?

20:02.335 --> 20:04.669
Yeah, well,
of course I am.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.505
Because I've never known
one to apologize.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.874
Or, for that matter,
give a damn who
he offended.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.843
Well, I-I'm not like
other doctors.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.214
I mean, to be honest,
I still haven't gotten
used to being one.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.449
Whenever someone
calls "doctor",

20:18.451 --> 20:20.818
I still turn to see
if they're talking
to the chap behind me.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.590
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you, nurse.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.563
Right.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.238
Remarkable, isn't she?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.006
She should be
on a stage,

20:42.008 --> 20:45.009
not languishing
in some asylum.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.678
Forgive me,
I'm Dr. Newgate.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.281
Edward Newgate.
And you are?

20:50.283 --> 20:53.918
Let Jael rejoice
with the Plover.

20:55.988 --> 21:01.425
Pardon me?
And Hobab rejoice
with Heraclitus.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.861
That is Greek
for the grub.

21:08.301 --> 21:11.269
<i>Ah, Newgate.
Tuxedo fits, I see.</i>

21:11.271 --> 21:14.672
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.908
I'm sorry,
but what's
he doing here?

21:17.910 --> 21:20.378
Oh, Jeremiah.
He killed his wife
with a hammer.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.280
Not without
provocation, mind you.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.449
But what's he doing here
in the staff parlor?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.419
When I was
a medical officer
in the war,

21:28.421 --> 21:31.055
we would on occasion
invite the enlisted men
to dine with us.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.625
It strengthened the bond
between the men and... kept
morale high.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.794
And I believe
the same principal
applies here.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.930
It's therapeutic
for the patients
to mix with polite society,

21:39.932 --> 21:44.068
<i>and, I might add,</i>
<i>for polite society</i>
<i>to mix with them.</i>

21:45.872 --> 21:48.572
Dinner is served.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.847
<i>Good boy.</i>

21:59.418 --> 22:01.419
<i>Good boy.</i>

22:01.421 --> 22:04.455
<i>Good boy.
Good boy.</i>

22:06.926 --> 22:09.527
<i>Tell me, doctor,</i>
<i>what do you think</i>
<i>of our little asylum?</i>

22:09.529 --> 22:14.398
Why, it's quite... unlike
anything I've ever known.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.636
Newgate recently took
his medical degree
at Oxford.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.806
But why come
all the way here

22:21.808 --> 22:25.009
when there are
other asylums
far closer to London?

22:25.011 --> 22:29.080
Well, I've always longed
to return to the countryside,
I suppose.

22:29.082 --> 22:31.382
You know, I-I grew up
in a farm in Yorkshire,

22:31.384 --> 22:33.651
and, uh, some
of my fondest memories

22:33.653 --> 22:36.373
are of the cows
and chickens that
were my playmates.

22:39.624 --> 22:41.492
<i>You don't have
the Yorkshire man's accent.</i>

22:42.994 --> 22:45.096
Why's that, Ted?

22:47.099 --> 22:52.002
Well, my, my,
my parents died
when I was six

22:52.004 --> 22:55.473
so I was sent
to an orphanage
in London.

22:55.475 --> 22:58.542
Appalling place.

22:58.544 --> 23:03.414
But, I mean, you know,
fascinating if one was curious
about human nature as I was.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.550
In a funny way,
I was quite grateful
to them.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.618
<i>How so?</i>

23:10.155 --> 23:14.825
Well, misery has a way
of clarifying one's
convictions.

23:14.827 --> 23:19.163
<i>See, it was in the orphanage</i>
<i>that I realized what my life's</i>
<i>work would be.</i>

23:19.165 --> 23:22.466
To labor
amongst the wretched
and the friendless.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.538
<i>And to give</i>
<i>these poor souls</i>
<i>some small measure</i>

23:27.540 --> 23:30.808
of hope and kindness

23:30.810 --> 23:32.810
in a world
that knows too little.

23:37.549 --> 23:41.029
Forgive me, I-I seem
to have turned dinner
into a Dickens' novel.

23:45.057 --> 23:49.126
Bon appetite.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.663
<i>What is this tonight, Finn?
Squirrel?</i>

23:52.665 --> 23:55.966
At present
we find ourselves
somewhat modestly provisioned.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.169
A toast to Mr. Finn

23:58.171 --> 24:01.038
for providing
such fine victuals
for our Christmas repast.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.907
Mickey Finn.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.643
Mickey Finn.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.280
I'm-I'm sorry.
Is that really your name?

24:12.050 --> 24:15.519
'Tis. Why?

24:15.521 --> 24:18.722
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>to slip someone</i>
<i>a Mickey Finn,</i>

24:20.692 --> 24:23.561
<i>you know,
with knock-out drops.</i>

24:23.563 --> 24:25.830
<i>It's quite, quite, uh...</i>

24:30.101 --> 24:32.102
Well, quite.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.911
That never occurred to me.
"Slip someone a Mickey."

24:43.015 --> 24:44.882
That must be
how me da got
me dear old ma

24:44.884 --> 24:47.852
to lie still
while he ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.762
You'll forgive me
if I don't find that
at all amusing.

24:58.764 --> 25:02.132
No?

25:02.134 --> 25:06.036
<i>What would bring</i>
<i>a smile to that puckered-ass</i>
<i>of a mouth of yours?</i>

25:06.038 --> 25:07.838
<i>That will be
enough, Finn.</i>

25:11.610 --> 25:14.178
My apologies.
I meant no offense.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.983
Yeah, well, none taken.

25:18.985 --> 25:24.088
That's the Christmas spirit.
Come now.

25:24.090 --> 25:28.993
<i>Let me offer you</i>
<i>a little drink</i>
<i>of friendship.</i>

25:30.929 --> 25:32.596
No, no, no.
I've had quite enough.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.265
Come on,
we're celebrating.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.767
<i>Honestly, Finn.</i>

25:36.769 --> 25:39.937
I'm sure he doesn't mind
raising a glass to our Lord
and Savior.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.072
Do you now, Doctor?

25:49.147 --> 25:51.215
I-I'd be delighted.

26:04.296 --> 26:08.198
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid
that will stain.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.267
<i>Soda water
will save it.</i>

26:10.269 --> 26:11.335
Follow me.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.788
You must leave here
immediately.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.058
But I've only
just arrived.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.927
You do not belong here.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.764
Why, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.100
There's time before
they get suspicious.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.936
They'll assume you went
to your room to change
your shirt, but don't.

26:45.938 --> 26:49.106
Leave your things.
Go straight to the stable.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.975
The roan is the most
sure-footed on the moor.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.776
She'll see you
safely back to town.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.645
You want me
to steal a horse?

26:54.647 --> 26:56.647
Lower your voice.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.149
No, not until you tell me
what's going on.

27:01.853 --> 27:03.287
Do as I say.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.823
Leave.
Now.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.292
Eliza.
Eliza, please...

27:20.672 --> 27:24.008
Mrs. Graves,
I'm... I'm so sorry.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.490
<i>I didn't mean
to upset you.</i>

27:43.728 --> 27:47.898
Mrs. Graves, indeed,
then listen to me.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.067
There's-There's something
I need to tell you.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.445
Help us.
Please.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.258
Get off me.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.228
<i>Help us!
Help us!</i>

30:31.230 --> 30:33.864
Help us.
We need food.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.101
Please.
Please, help us.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.336
Who are you, boy?

30:41.606 --> 30:44.208
I-I'm a doctor.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.476
<i>Liar.</i>
<i>I've never</i>
<i>set eyes on you.</i>

30:46.478 --> 30:48.378
Where are you from?

30:48.380 --> 30:51.014
Upstairs.
Before that, you fool.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.115
I'm from Oxford.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.487
You listen to me,

30:57.489 --> 31:00.891
<i>and listen
carefully, boy.</i>

31:00.893 --> 31:04.361
You have got to help us
escape from these cages.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.965
<i>We're not mad.
We're not mad.</i>

31:07.967 --> 31:11.001
We're not mad.
We're not mad.
Please.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.369
<i>Please help us.</i>

31:15.407 --> 31:17.174
Of course you're not.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.176
You've got to help us.
I will, I will.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.345
First thing in the morning,
I'll consult with Dr. Lamb.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.513
<i>Dr. Lamb?
Are you daft?</i>

31:23.515 --> 31:26.283
If he learns that
you found us, he'll slit
your throat and ours.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.352
You must get the keys.
Let us out.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.454
<i>Please, we're not mad.</i>
All right.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.022
You've got to help us.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.924
I'll see to it
in the morning.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.559
Let us out.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.394
<i>Newgate.</i>

31:38.930 --> 31:41.031
<i>Edward Newgate.</i>

31:53.978 --> 31:55.646
How do you know
my name?

31:55.648 --> 31:58.448
Your letter.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.184
You remember, Benjamin?
It was weeks ago.

32:01.186 --> 32:04.586
The young man
who wrote to us
from Oxford.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.557
I remember.
Newgate.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.996
<i>Your letter came
with the last mail delivery</i>

32:12.998 --> 32:15.599
before Lamb
overthrew us.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.602
Overthrew you?
<i>Yes.</i>

32:18.604 --> 32:20.604
Overthrew?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.139
<i>What is going on?</i>

32:22.141 --> 32:25.375
I am Marion Pike.
Matron.

32:25.377 --> 32:29.413
<i>Charles Swanwick.
Chief medical officer.</i>

32:29.415 --> 32:33.317
Nurse.
<i>William Paxton,</i>
<i>groundskeeper.</i>

32:33.319 --> 32:36.086
<i>Dr. Benjamin Salt,</i>

32:36.088 --> 32:40.357
rightful Superintendent
of Stonehearst asylum.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.462
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.098
If you really are
the superintendent,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.334
then that means
that Dr. Lamb is...

32:50.336 --> 32:53.603
A lunatic demon
of the worst kind.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.340
Oh, good God.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.342
<i>God.</i>

32:58.344 --> 33:00.410
What happened?

33:00.412 --> 33:03.046
They put something
in our drink, Doc.

33:03.048 --> 33:06.016
<i>Chloral hydrate.</i>
<i>It's-It's a surgical</i>
<i>anesthetic.</i>

33:06.018 --> 33:08.118
It's colorless
and odorless,

33:08.120 --> 33:11.421
but lethal
in imprecise doses.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.423
I lost four
doctors that night.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.593
<i>Three of my nurses died.
Poor creatures.</i>

33:16.595 --> 33:18.762
<i>They'd been</i>
<i>planning this for months.</i>
<i>Treacherous bastards.</i>

33:18.764 --> 33:22.065
Just biding their time
to slip us...

33:22.067 --> 33:24.701
A Mickey Finn.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.470
<i>I don't believe...</i>

33:26.472 --> 33:28.672
They give us water,
a pittance of food.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.441
But make
no mistake, Doctor,
we are dying.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.377
We are dying.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.480
<i>You could steal
the keys from Finn.</i>

33:36.482 --> 33:38.648
Ah?
Set us free.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.451
They'd tear us apart
before we'd gone
a hundred yards.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.120
<i>We'll take
our chances fighting.</i>

33:43.122 --> 33:45.522
In our condition,
against their numbers?

33:45.524 --> 33:48.492
<i>There are homicidal</i>
<i>maniacs upstairs</i>
<i>with guns, Charles.</i>

33:48.494 --> 33:52.462
Look around you.
None of us are fit
to fight.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.798
<i>Some of us are
too far gone already.</i>

33:56.467 --> 33:59.302
There's only
one solution.

33:59.304 --> 34:03.707
<i>It's you, Doctor.</i>
<i>You're our only chance.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

34:03.709 --> 34:06.309
Run, boy.
The keys.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.045
<i>Run, boy.
Get to town.</i>

34:08.047 --> 34:10.813
Bring help.
Run.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.748
The keys.

34:12.751 --> 34:17.087
Run.
Run, boy.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.130
Who is it, Eliza?
I'm frightened.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.498
It's no one, dearest.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.701
Just the Sandman.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.737
Mrs. Graves.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.739
<i>Is he going to try
and make love to us?</i>

34:35.741 --> 34:37.474
Back to sleep.

34:42.146 --> 34:45.315
Mrs. Graves, we must
leave here immediately.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.152
You had your chance
to leave before.

34:51.289 --> 34:54.609
I have found Salt
and the others,
Mrs. Graves.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.841
Do you realize
what would've happened
if you'd been caught?

35:10.843 --> 35:12.742
I have some idea.
You have no idea.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.644
We can argue
about this later.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.847
Right now I need you
to fetch your warmest coat

35:16.849 --> 35:18.682
and meet me in the gazebo
in ten minutes.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.118
We can steal a horse,
and if we're lucky

35:21.120 --> 35:22.853
we can make it
to town and summon help.

35:22.855 --> 35:24.888
Why would you presume
I would go anywhere
with you?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.791
Because I cannot...

35:27.793 --> 35:30.894
I will not leave
without you.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.133
I must go back to bed.
Listen to me.

35:36.135 --> 35:39.695
The lunatics
are running
this asylum.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.640
Yes, and I am one of them.

35:45.877 --> 35:49.146
<i>What's this I see?</i>

35:58.689 --> 36:02.526
Evening rounds
are finished, Doctor.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.368
<i>I was just giving</i>
<i>Dr. Newgate directions</i>
<i>back to his room.</i>

36:07.532 --> 36:10.300
Lost, is he?

36:10.302 --> 36:13.703
Ah, yes,
embarrassingly so.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.805
I was looking
for the staff library.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.941
<i>I must have made
a wrong turn.</i>

36:20.711 --> 36:22.946
<i>Well, any event,</i>
<i>I know where</i>
<i>I'm headed now,</i>

36:22.948 --> 36:25.515
so I'll bid you all
good night.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.584
Thank you, Mrs. Graves.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.353
Finn, see
the young doctor
to his room.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.922
My pleasure.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.257
No, no.
Won't be necessary.

36:34.259 --> 36:37.794
Oh, I insist.
And I shall expect you
for morning rounds.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.896
<i>Half past eight.</i>

36:39.898 --> 36:42.265
Right.
Of course.

36:42.267 --> 36:43.733
<i>This way, Ted.</i>

36:55.346 --> 36:57.614
Does he suspect anything?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.849
No.

36:59.851 --> 37:03.353
We must endeavor
to make sure
it stays that way.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.492
Something is
troubling you,
my dear.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.728
This cannot last, Silas.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.331
Eventually
we will be discovered.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.500
The spring is coming.
People will come.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.669
Visitors.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.504
We cannot just
lock them out.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.609
The only reason
any of us are here

37:25.611 --> 37:27.911
is because the world
wanted to be rid of us.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.480
We're embarrassments
to our family,

37:30.482 --> 37:32.916
exiles to the human race.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.719
We will not be discovered
for the simple reason
that no one cares.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.021
My husband does.

37:42.493 --> 37:45.028
I promise you

37:45.030 --> 37:47.931
you will always be safe
within these walls.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.824
<i>I'm afraid this
is all I could find.</i>

38:14.826 --> 38:17.027
Supplies upstairs
are running low.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.298
<i>I'll bring more
next time.</i>

38:21.300 --> 38:22.999
And some laudanum
for that cough of yours.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.402
Bless you, Doctor.

38:25.404 --> 38:29.539
<i>It's men</i>
<i>with guns we need,</i>
<i>not medicine.</i>

38:29.541 --> 38:31.808
That's not an option
anymore, Doctor.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.478
After last night,
Finn and his goons
are watching me like hawks.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.048
I barely made it
here undetected.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.983
<i>Come back here.
Please mate, come on.</i>

38:39.985 --> 38:43.687
I could be wrong,
but Lamb strikes me
as a man

38:43.689 --> 38:45.722
<i>who would rather</i>
<i>see the ship sink</i>
<i>with everyone in it</i>

38:45.724 --> 38:47.557
than give up the helm.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.826
Oh, sweet Jesus.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.095
<i>So, even</i>
<i>if we did steal away</i>
<i>and find help,</i>

38:52.097 --> 38:54.464
God knows
what would await us
when we returned.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.999
We?

38:58.035 --> 39:00.770
Well, me-me
and Mrs. Graves.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.406
Eliza Graves?

39:03.408 --> 39:06.109
<i>Don't be a fool, man.</i>
<i>She's as mad as the lot</i>
<i>of them.</i>

39:06.111 --> 39:08.345
No, no, I...
I don't believe she is.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.880
<i>Tell that
to her husband.</i>

39:10.882 --> 39:13.817
<i>But make sure you speak</i>
<i>into his good ear, the one</i>
<i>she didn't bite off.</i>

39:13.819 --> 39:17.354
The man is a monster.
She was right
to defend herself.

39:17.356 --> 39:21.091
<i>Mrs. Pike, may I remind you</i>
<i>on which side of the bars</i>
<i>you sit?</i>

39:21.093 --> 39:23.727
<i>So, you cannot flee,</i>

39:23.729 --> 39:26.396
<i>you cannot steal
Finn's keys.</i>

39:26.398 --> 39:30.767
What do you
propose to do?
Huh?

39:30.769 --> 39:34.738
Look, I came here
to study his methods.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.707
<i>Now, Lamb sees me
as his protégé.</i>

39:37.709 --> 39:40.377
If I could just
maintain that-that trust,

39:40.379 --> 39:43.646
<i>you know, understand</i>
<i>the workings</i>
<i>of his mind,</i>

39:43.648 --> 39:46.049
maybe I could
bring him to reason.

39:49.453 --> 39:53.857
He killed
five soldiers
in cold blood.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.497
And do you think
you can outfox him, boy?

40:02.166 --> 40:04.801
If you could just
give me his case file.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.569
<i>Long gone.</i>

40:06.571 --> 40:08.971
It's the first thing
he'd have destroyed.

40:12.510 --> 40:16.179
Well then... well then,
I'd best be back
before I'm missed.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.717
In the medicine cabinet.

40:20.719 --> 40:23.019
Behind the Scotch.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.990
<i>In his...
In-in my office.</i>

40:26.992 --> 40:31.661
He escaped once before
and he stole it, briefly.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.564
I didn't want
to give him that
pleasure again,

40:34.566 --> 40:37.867
so I hid his casebook.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.103
Right.

40:41.839 --> 40:44.140
<i>Doctor?</i>

40:44.142 --> 40:45.975
<i>I want to warn you.</i>

40:45.977 --> 40:49.779
I do not know
what Lamb's plan
is for us,

40:49.781 --> 40:54.484
but I do know
that if he believes
you could jeopardize it,

40:54.486 --> 40:58.021
<i>he will not hesitate
to slit your throat.</i>

40:58.023 --> 41:01.825
Deplorable conditions these,
but soon I mean to make
a change.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.027
And what better way
to bring in the new century

41:04.029 --> 41:07.197
than by doing away
with this godforsaken ward

41:07.199 --> 41:09.599
and all the backward
thinking it represents.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.068
Right, Finn?
Right, then.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.070
So, what do you hope
to do with the current
residents?

41:14.072 --> 41:16.739
Introduce them
to the general population.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.875
You're not serious.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.010
Keep a man in a cage
and he'll behave like
an animal.

41:21.012 --> 41:26.049
Give him his freedom
and he'll remember
his humanity.

41:26.051 --> 41:29.291
And that's your plan,
is it, to create
an enlightened society?

41:31.489 --> 41:35.058
Do I sense skepticism
in your question, Doctor?

41:35.060 --> 41:38.995
No, not at all.
I suppose I'm just
curious to know

41:38.997 --> 41:42.565
if you think there are
any individuals whose crimes
are so heinous

41:42.567 --> 41:44.267
they justify imprisonment.

41:48.672 --> 41:52.075
Sadists... who find
gratification

41:52.077 --> 41:54.143
<i>in the debasement
of others.</i>

41:54.145 --> 41:56.880
And those cowards who
would send younger men
to their deaths

41:56.882 --> 41:59.549
in battles
they themselves
would avoid.

41:59.551 --> 42:02.919
<i>Except for these,</i>
<i>I believe all men can</i>
<i>be rehabilitated</i>

42:02.921 --> 42:07.824
often by the simple act
of having their dignity
restored.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.769
Who-who's down there?

42:19.771 --> 42:21.538
<i>The Ogre of Oxbridge.</i>

42:21.540 --> 42:24.307
The Ogre of what?
<i>Stage name.</i>

42:24.309 --> 42:27.189
<i>His family sold him off</i>
<i>to a side show when he was</i>
<i>a child.</i>

42:29.548 --> 42:32.948
He injured his hand
a few days ago whilst
attacking a nurse.

42:35.886 --> 42:39.722
<i>Would you be so kind</i>
<i>as to change the dressing,</i>
<i>Doctor?</i>

42:39.724 --> 42:42.559
You expect me
to go down there?

42:42.561 --> 42:45.241
You came here
for clinical experience,
did you not?

42:48.265 --> 42:50.567
Yes, of course.

42:54.072 --> 42:58.274
Well, two grains of opium,
I should think, will do
the trick.

42:58.276 --> 43:00.577
Don't need that.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.419
What do you
expect me to do,
sing him a lullaby?

43:03.847 --> 43:06.049
Use these.

43:06.051 --> 43:08.952
The asylum doctor's
greatest ally.

43:21.298 --> 43:23.866
Look out
for the piss bucket.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.712
Hello?

43:45.389 --> 43:47.624
Now listen here.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.693
I don't mean
to harm you,
Mr. Ogre.

43:52.097 --> 43:53.217
I just want
to see your hand.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.870
Oh, good God.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.672
It's all right.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.874
It's all right.
It's all right.

44:10.114 --> 44:12.181
Lamb, please help.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.303
<i>Eyes, Newgate.
Eyes.</i>

44:25.362 --> 44:26.996
Arthur.

44:34.071 --> 44:37.040
Arthur.
Arthur, please.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.809
P-Please, Arthur.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.446
Arthur.
Arthur.

44:50.087 --> 44:52.689
<i>Forgive me, Arthur.</i>

44:52.691 --> 44:54.924
May I call you Arthur?

44:56.026 --> 44:58.161
Can I?

44:58.163 --> 45:00.830
I-I didn't mean to enter
without permission.

45:00.832 --> 45:03.132
I meant no offense.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.834
I'm Dr. Newgate.

45:07.738 --> 45:10.139
But you
can call me Edward.

45:10.141 --> 45:11.808
It's all right.

45:17.281 --> 45:19.849
Eddard?

45:19.851 --> 45:21.751
That's right, Edward.

45:21.753 --> 45:24.220
Eddard.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.422
Now, Arthur,

45:26.424 --> 45:29.926
let's, let's have
a look at that hand,
shall we?

45:29.928 --> 45:32.729
It's okay.
All right.

45:32.731 --> 45:34.797
<i>That's it, Arthur.</i>

45:34.799 --> 45:38.067
Bravo, Doctor.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.236
Bravo.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.835
Can you take
your trousers off,
please?

45:56.320 --> 45:58.488
No, no.
It's, uh,
it's my shoulder.

45:58.490 --> 46:01.224
Please?

46:01.226 --> 46:02.992
<i>I will do that, Millie.</i>

46:02.994 --> 46:04.994
You may return
to your duties.

46:04.996 --> 46:07.897
But I want to.
Leave us.

46:17.007 --> 46:18.374
Sit down.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.920
Bare your shoulder.

46:37.227 --> 46:40.196
Stubborn fool.
Why didn't you listen?

46:40.198 --> 46:42.365
You could've left
when you had the chance.

46:42.367 --> 46:45.134
I didn't know then
what I do now, Eliza.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.036
Don't call me that.

46:49.106 --> 46:52.275
Mrs. Graves,
you have to understand,

46:52.277 --> 46:53.843
you are
in danger here.

46:53.845 --> 46:57.246
I can assure you
I am not.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.448
Give me your hand.

47:03.854 --> 47:07.323
And what of those
down below?

47:07.325 --> 47:09.025
What about them?

47:13.363 --> 47:15.565
Mrs. Pike
and the women,

47:15.567 --> 47:18.167
are they suffering
terribly?

47:18.169 --> 47:20.503
Yes, all of them are.

47:22.339 --> 47:25.474
You could go down
there yourself.

47:25.476 --> 47:28.945
Or are you afraid that
what you'll see will weaken
your loyalty to Lamb?

47:28.947 --> 47:31.347
You have no idea
what it was like here
before.

47:31.349 --> 47:34.016
What monsters Salt
and his men were.

47:34.018 --> 47:38.120
How we were stripped bare
and subjected to examinations

47:38.122 --> 47:40.890
of the most disgusting,
intimate nature.

47:40.892 --> 47:43.359
Strapped to tables,

47:43.361 --> 47:46.929
given drugs to dull
our senses, and doused
with ice-cold water

47:46.931 --> 47:50.366
and made to suffer
a thousand other indignities
too horrible to mention.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.468
But you couldn't
possibly understand.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.438
I can.
I-I can.

48:00.277 --> 48:01.644
I can.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.114
I can.

48:22.065 --> 48:25.268
I know what
cruelty is,
Mrs. Graves.

48:25.270 --> 48:28.504
I-I know.

48:28.506 --> 48:31.007
And I give you my word

48:31.009 --> 48:34.377
that you will never again
have to suffer the way
that you have.

48:34.379 --> 48:37.046
Never.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.182
Why do you care so much
what happens to me?

48:40.184 --> 48:43.119
Because

48:43.121 --> 48:46.188
the very thought
of you locked away
in this madhouse

48:46.190 --> 48:48.624
is abhorrent
to everything
that I believe,

48:48.626 --> 48:53.162
as a doctor
and... and as a man.

48:58.502 --> 49:00.169
Excuse me.

49:07.644 --> 49:11.213
<i>For Christ's sake, Swanwick,
will you give it up?</i>

49:11.215 --> 49:13.215
We have as much chance
of escaping that way

49:13.217 --> 49:16.519
as a man
clawing his way
out of his own grave.

49:16.521 --> 49:21.324
Maybe so, but at least
it won't say on my gravestone
what it'll say on yours.

49:23.060 --> 49:25.628
"He died like a dog
in the dark."

49:32.303 --> 49:35.438
You done it.
You done it.

49:35.440 --> 49:38.240
<i>Get to town.
Quick. Hurry.</i>

49:38.242 --> 49:39.802
<i>Get help.
Hurry.</i>

50:32.662 --> 50:34.797
<i>I still don't get
why he's walking around.</i>

50:34.799 --> 50:37.199
<i>He should be down
in a cage with the others.</i>

50:37.201 --> 50:40.436
I cannot continue to run
this bloody asylum
on my own.

50:40.438 --> 50:42.738
I need an assistant.
I thought that was me.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.442
With medical training.

50:46.444 --> 50:49.311
How hard can it be
to play a doctor?

50:49.313 --> 50:51.514
"Turn your head
and cough."

50:51.516 --> 50:54.150
"Bend over, young lady,
while I take a little
look at you."

50:54.152 --> 50:58.187
Your talents
are better suited
to other duties.

51:00.525 --> 51:05.361
Like making sure
the dipsomaniacs keep
the bloody boilers stoked.

51:05.363 --> 51:07.797
<i>Bloody icebox in here.</i>

51:07.799 --> 51:10.166
What's he got on you?

51:13.070 --> 51:15.171
What are you
talking about?

51:15.173 --> 51:17.093
<i>You haven't been the same
since he showed up.</i>

51:20.544 --> 51:24.146
I suppose I feel
a certain sense
of duty towards him.

51:24.148 --> 51:27.483
He has the makings
of a fine asylum doctor.

51:27.485 --> 51:32.588
<i>Reminds me of myself,
a... headstrong, idealistic.</i>

51:34.291 --> 51:35.691
Ah.

51:35.693 --> 51:37.933
Fetch another,
would you?

51:40.464 --> 51:43.099
<i>I sense a kindred
spirit in him.</i>

51:43.101 --> 51:45.868
I believe he may understand
what I'm trying to accomplish
here.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.404
Yeah, well,
how understanding
is he going to be

51:48.406 --> 51:51.340
<i>if he discovers Salt
and all them others?</i>

51:51.342 --> 51:54.622
Come the New Year,
that won't matter
any longer.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.999
There'll be nothing
to discover.

52:00.650 --> 52:04.553
<i>I tell you,</i>
<i>I don't trust</i>
<i>that little gutterfuck.</i>

52:04.555 --> 52:06.122
He's up to something.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.626
Perhaps I'm wrong
about him,

52:10.628 --> 52:14.497
<i>but he's taken</i>
<i>a keen interest</i>
<i>in our Lady Graves.</i>

52:14.499 --> 52:16.899
He won't be raising
any alarms

52:16.901 --> 52:19.735
<i>unless he has her
on his side.</i>

52:19.737 --> 52:22.872
And that I can assure you
will never happen.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.544
Someone's escaped.

52:43.760 --> 52:45.694
Oi.
Hai!

52:47.931 --> 52:50.091
Here.
Here.
Here.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.673
If they reach town,
it's the end of us.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.543
They won't.

53:20.330 --> 53:22.490
Come on.
Come on.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.821
Oh, Lord, no.
No.

53:45.823 --> 53:49.892
Now, now, gentlemen.

53:49.894 --> 53:52.995
<i>You get back.
You bastards.</i>

53:52.997 --> 53:55.831
Back.
Get back.

53:55.833 --> 53:58.834
There's no need
for tears.

53:58.836 --> 54:02.404
You have my word
you won't be harmed.

54:02.406 --> 54:06.342
Is that what you said
to your mother and sister

54:06.344 --> 54:08.477
before you slashed
their throats? Hm?

54:13.883 --> 54:15.851
Aye, Mr. Swan.

54:15.853 --> 54:19.622
But your methods
have cured my madness.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.393
I'm a peaceful man now.

54:24.395 --> 54:26.462
I am.

54:26.464 --> 54:28.631
A veritable... lamb.

54:30.433 --> 54:33.469
No!

54:42.979 --> 54:45.281
It's a sad
and shameful thing that.

54:47.784 --> 54:50.619
Come now, Mr. Swanwick.

54:50.621 --> 54:53.781
Let's get inside
before we all catch
our deaths.

55:12.542 --> 55:14.443
Oh, dear.

55:18.515 --> 55:22.418
One of them
threw themselves
from Stag's Leap.

55:22.420 --> 55:25.020
And this one came
at me like a banshee.

55:25.022 --> 55:28.924
<i>The horse spooked,</i>
<i>reared up and kicked</i>
<i>the old pecker in the nut.</i>

55:28.926 --> 55:33.495
Fell down stone dead.

55:33.497 --> 55:36.932
<i>Suicidal tendencies</i>
<i>are not uncommon amongst</i>
<i>the seriously deranged.</i>

55:36.934 --> 55:40.069
<i>As we know.</i>

55:41.504 --> 55:43.639
<i>Finn.</i>

55:43.641 --> 55:46.108
See that the body
is buried.
Aye.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.943
Dr. Lamb.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.716
Did he stab himself
in the back as well?

55:56.486 --> 56:00.422
He must have landed
on something when he fell.

56:00.424 --> 56:02.358
Something sharp.

56:05.695 --> 56:08.497
Pity.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.819
No, you can't just
walk away from this.

56:11.668 --> 56:14.069
From what, dear boy?

56:14.071 --> 56:16.672
Sir, if you would only
just examine the body
yourself.

56:16.674 --> 56:20.142
I am not a coroner.
Nor are you.

56:20.144 --> 56:22.411
Dr. Lamb, this man
has clearly been...

56:22.413 --> 56:24.380
Killed by a horse.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.949
<i>I have an asylum to run.</i>

56:26.951 --> 56:31.420
And you I believe, Doctor,
have patients to attend to.

56:31.422 --> 56:33.555
This is madness.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.691
What did you say?

56:35.693 --> 56:38.494
I said
this is madness.
Madness.

56:38.496 --> 56:41.130
Madness, you say?

56:41.132 --> 56:44.166
<i>How dare you accuse me</i>
<i>of madness in front</i>
<i>of my own staff?</i>

56:44.168 --> 56:45.834
I didn't accuse you
of anything.

56:45.836 --> 56:48.537
Two patients
are dead, Newgate,

56:48.539 --> 56:50.639
<i>because you</i>
<i>were not doing your duty</i>
<i>and watching over them.</i>

56:50.641 --> 56:52.841
Silas.
<i>Where were you, Newgate,</i>

56:52.843 --> 56:54.843
<i>when these two
fellows escaped?</i>

56:54.845 --> 56:56.945
How many more must die
because of your negligence?

56:56.947 --> 56:58.747
Silas!

57:13.129 --> 57:16.031
Nurse, I think
we'd better get
ourselves inside.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.912
<i>March 1st, 1891.</i>

57:31.948 --> 57:35.017
<i>This enigma</i>
<i>called Silas Lamb</i>
<i>continues to mystify me.</i>

57:38.555 --> 57:42.491
<i>Silas remains mute</i>
<i>about his years</i>
<i>as a military surgeon,</i>

57:42.493 --> 57:44.526
<i>the war,</i>

57:44.528 --> 57:47.062
<i>and most of all,
the horrific incident</i>

57:47.064 --> 57:49.398
<i>that had him committed
to this asylum.</i>

57:53.203 --> 57:55.871
No! No!

57:55.873 --> 57:58.540
<i>And yet he has
no such reservations</i>

57:58.542 --> 58:00.676
<i>when it comes</i>
<i>to protesting</i>
<i>what he calls</i>

58:00.678 --> 58:03.111
<i>my "barbaric" methods.</i>

58:11.155 --> 58:15.224
<i>How ironic</i>
<i>to be called cruel</i>
<i>by a man such as this,</i>

58:15.226 --> 58:18.660
<i>a man accused
of such atrocities.</i>

58:18.662 --> 58:20.662
No! No!

58:23.567 --> 58:26.635
<i>When you have found
the thing a man fears most,</i>

58:26.637 --> 58:30.072
<i>you will have discovered
the key to his madness</i>

58:30.074 --> 58:31.874
<i>and the means
to control it.</i>

58:42.986 --> 58:44.786
<i>Silas appears
to fear very little.</i>

58:47.557 --> 58:50.726
<i>But all men have
their breaking points.</i>

58:50.728 --> 58:54.796
<i>And I am bound by my oath
as his doctor to find his.</i>

58:54.798 --> 58:56.265
<i>To cure him</i>

58:56.267 --> 58:58.800
<i>and to make him whole.</i>

59:05.074 --> 59:08.710
<i>I believe Silas enjoys
what he mistakenly believes</i>

59:08.712 --> 59:11.647
<i>is his control over me.</i>

59:14.584 --> 59:17.219
<i>In his tormented mind,
his stay at Stonehearst</i>

59:17.221 --> 59:18.954
<i>is merely a chess match.</i>

59:22.592 --> 59:26.094
<i>And I am his pawn
to move as he sees fit</i>

59:26.096 --> 59:29.565
<i>for his pleasure.</i>

59:29.567 --> 59:32.100
<i>But like most children,
Silas seems to forget</i>

59:34.003 --> 59:36.104
<i>all games must end.</i>

59:40.843 --> 59:43.211
<i>And there is only
one victor.</i>

59:54.357 --> 59:57.359
<i>October 3rd., 1899.</i>

59:57.361 --> 01:00:00.662
<i>Over the past
nine years now</i>

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:03.699
<i>I have struggled
to determine</i>

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:08.136
<i>what it is that haunts
the soul of Silas Lamb.</i>

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.805
<i>A cruel mother?</i>

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:12.074
<i>A sadistic father?</i>

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.743
<i>Indifferent God?</i>

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:25.821
<i>I don't claim
to know the answer.</i>

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:29.124
<i>I only know</i>
<i>that animals</i>
<i>like Silas Lamb</i>

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.626
<i>must be broken</i>

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.262
<i>to be made men again.</i>

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:57.377
That's one
of my suits
you are wearing.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.722
Fits me well,
don't you think?

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.959
Of course,
I had to have it
taken in a bit.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:06.828
But then,

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.930
you're a stouter
fellow than I am.

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.766
Or were.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.803
I suppose
I shouldn't be surprised

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:18.206
that killing
unarmed men
in cold blood

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.976
hasn't affected
your appetite.

01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.944
On the contrary.

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:25.947
Their deaths
were most distressing

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.984
to myself
and my staff.
<i>Staff?</i>

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.853
A bunch of inebriates
and chronic masturbators
more like it.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.691
Funny I've never seen
the harm in chronic
masturbation.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:40.228
Nevertheless,
I bring condolences

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.131
and a recommendation
that no one else repeat
their error.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.767
<i>And as a show
of good faith,</i>

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:47.836
I'll increase
your rations

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:50.072
and send down
more fresh water.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:53.141
<i>You see,</i>
<i>old friend,</i>
<i>unlike you,</i>

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.378
I'm not a cruel man.

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.384
Whilst, uh,

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:06.822
whilst I'm here,

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:10.959
I thought you might like
a report on the condition
of the patients.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.794
I don't give a damn.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:15.063
They're not
my responsibility
any more.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.799
<i>The melancholiacs
are less lethargic</i>

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.936
since being weaned off
the large doses of opium
you had them on.

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:23.772
<i>The hysterics
are less listless</i>

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:26.374
<i>now that they don't have</i>
<i>you poking around their</i>
<i>private parts.</i>

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:30.812
Even the mongoloids
are thriving since being
taken out of their restraints

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.348
and put to meaningful
work in the kitchens.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:34.983
A pity it's all
for naught

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:37.252
when they starve
to death.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.287
We are sufficiently
provisioned.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.995
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I think,</i>
<i>old friend.</i>

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:50.132
I think that
you haven't taken
anything for that cough

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:53.034
because you neglected
to lock the medical cabinet

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:55.437
and the opium addicts
got into the laudanum.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:58.507
And I suspect that
you're wearing that suit

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:01.777
because it's the warmest
suit in my closet,

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:04.246
<i>which comes in very handy
when you have imbeciles</i>

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.288
looking after
the boilers.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.017
I hope
you've enjoyed

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:12.888
pretending
to be sane, Silas.

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:17.159
<i>Has this masquerade</i>

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:21.062
<i>helped you to forget
what it was like</i>

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:25.934
blowing those poor
boys' brains through
their skulls?

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.943
Mr. Finn.
Dr. Lamb.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.947
<i>Find Dr. Newgate.</i>

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:41.049
Have him meet me
in the surgery.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.391
Fine.
Don't eat.

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:51.827
See if I care.
Silly old cow.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.295
Millie.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.597
I'm tired.

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:58.233
I'm tired
of being a nurse.

01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:01.970
Can't things
go back to the way
they were before?

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.071
<i>May I try?</i>

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.513
Thank you.

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.119
Now,

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:19.588
will you try one
for me?

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.559
He doesn't like
the taste of it.
No.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.995
Your son, right?

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:29.231
And he tastes
what you taste,
does he?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.569
But how?
Right through the cord.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:39.407
Do you not see
how it stretches from me
out the window to him?

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:45.313
He's off fighting
the Afghans, he is.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:55.523
You don't want me
to starve, do you,

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.494
Mother?

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:04.199
<i>Daniel?</i>

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.968
Yes.
Blessed Lord.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.337
Is it really you, Daniel?

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:12.073
Yes, it's me.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:15.677
Listen, no matter
how great the distance
between us,

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.013
you will always be
on my mind.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.917
My dearest boy.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.621
Listen, Mother,

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:29.557
I'm afraid I have
to go abroad again

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:33.528
on a secret
diplomatic mission
for Her Majesty the Queen.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.597
<i>Where?</i>

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.999
I'm not
at liberty to say.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:41.603
But food
is very scarce there

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.471
so I need you
to eat for the both of us.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.943
Can you do that for me?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.580
For Daniel?

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:02.057
<i>I will.
I will.</i>

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:04.492
That's it.
That's it.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.362
Well done.

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:08.430
Very good.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.504
No, no, no.
Go off to bed.
Get some rest.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:19.240
I still have
the bedpans to do.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:21.176
No, doctor's orders.

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:23.211
Fine.
Go.

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.082
Millie, lock the door.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.453
A couple more.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:34.489
Very good.
That's it.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.224
That's it.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.096
Very good.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.268
Thank you so much.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.637
Millie really
needs the rest.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:52.340
Lamb has her
running herself ragged
doing the work of four nurses.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:55.610
On an empty stomach,
in a ward with no heat.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:59.314
Well, in a few months
it'll be spring.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:01.416
In a few months
we may all be dead.

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:07.155
Pneumonia. Typhus.
Starvation.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.057
<i>Finn, even.</i>

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:14.329
Look, Lamb's experiment
is crumbling, Eliza.

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:17.365
<i>Look, he cannot see it</i>
<i>because he's blinded</i>
<i>by madness.</i>

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.667
But you're not.

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:25.607
When I first arrived here,
Millie could barely speak.

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:29.009
Salt had put her
in a morphine coma
to control her.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.248
Lamb took her off
all sorts of medication.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.749
Had her work
on the wards.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.252
It was good for her.

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:40.121
She's grown
into a capable
young woman.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:45.126
Yes, with the mind
of a child, but she's
alive, Edward.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:51.366
You love her
like your own sister.
Yes.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.535
That's why
I can never
leave her.

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.537
Well, you don't have to.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:08:00.408
Really,
you don't have to.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.211
We can go together
all three of us.
Together.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.346
Start a new life
away from here.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.084
Where?
Spain, Italy.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:11.419
Someplace where the sun
is always shining

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:15.757
and the sky is blue,
and... and you can be free

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:18.193
to do whatever
you want to do.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.694
Somewhere you can be
truly, truly alive.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:23.264
I can make
that happen.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.866
I can.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:26.701
Nothing can get
in our way.
Nothing.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.738
My husband can.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.508
If he does,
then I would kill him.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.877
Be careful, Edward.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.747
When you speak like that,
you don't sound like a doctor.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.783
When I'm with you, I...

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.786
I forget that I am.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.330
<i>I wouldn't get
too close to that one.</i>

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.394
Bit of a biter, she is.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.631
<i>Dr. Lamb requests
your presence.</i>

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.337
Where?

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:04.139
Follow me.

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:28.363
<i>Ah, Newgate,</i>
<i>just in time.</i>
For what?

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:31.499
To assist me
in an experimental procedure
of my own devising

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:35.170
which, when perfected,
I expect to usher
in a new era

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.705
in the humane treatment
of lunacy.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.877
An unfortunate case.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.247
Believes himself to be
the rightful superintendent
of Stonehearst.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.219
It's a common delusion.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.389
Ranks right behind
Napoleon and Jesus Christ.

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:57.358
What are you going
do to him?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.294
Treat him, of course.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.363
With Edison's miracle
of our age,

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.200
we shall banish to history
the straitjackets,

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:09.270
the cold baths,
the nausea machines,

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:11.272
the floggings.

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:13.675
Finn, we will start
with three seconds.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.948
I call it
"electrotherapy".

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:24.519
And I think you'll be
fascinated to see

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:27.455
<i>what happens</i>
<i>when it is applied</i>
<i>to the subject's brain.</i>

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.565
You'll need
a stronger stomach

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.934
if you expect
to practice
asylum medicine.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:43.972
It may look painful,
but I can assure you
he feels nothing.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:46.975
Yeah, but his heart.
A tenth of that could
stop his heart.

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:49.410
You may do the honors
this time, Doctor.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.412
What? No.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.848
A dose of five seconds
should clinch it.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.370
<i>But, Dr. Lamb, you can't</i>
<i>possibly imagine that I...</i>
Do it!

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.521
Do it.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:44.065
And now

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.401
you will see

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:49.370
the miraculous effects

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.440
of this remarkable
new therapy.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.578
What is your name, sir?

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.949
I don't know.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:05.320
Are you
the superintendent here?

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.090
I don't know.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:11.993
<i>As you can see,</i>

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.762
<i>a mind that was not</i>
<i>moments ago tormented</i>
<i>by delusion</i>

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.998
is now pacified.

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:22.003
I... Am I in hospital?

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:27.342
You are a patient
at Stonehearst Asylum.

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.612
Who are you people?

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.583
Tell him, Doctor.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.454
Tell him.

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.728
We are your keepers.

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:29.904
I'm afraid
that's the last
of the laudanum.

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.006
Thank you, Doctor.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:40.515
Now listen.
You must rest
if you can.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:43.397
You need
your strength.
For what?

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.956
Tonight I intend
to set you free.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:51.125
All of you.
Tonight?

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.628
Why?

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.967
Because I-I fear
Lamb's procedure
on Salt

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.289
was merely
a rehearsal.

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:06.752
I fear he means
to do it to all
of you.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.510
Tonight.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:20.488
I never did approve
of Dr. Salt's methods.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:24.592
Of course,
it wasn't my place
to criticize.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:27.728
You know,
Eliza said you were
always very kind to her

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.864
and the other patients.

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:32.867
I loved them
like my own children.

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.903
Even Lamb?

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.209
There is some good
even in poor Silas.

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:44.745
Though I fear
it has become
deranged by madness.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:47.148
How do I understand him?

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:53.654
Your first instinct
was the right one.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.756
Think of him
as your patient.

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:59.026
Shine the light
of your sympathy

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.229
into the darkest
corners of his mind,

01:15:01.231 --> 01:15:05.967
and maybe then you'll find
what he so desperately wants

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:09.504
to keep hidden from you
and from himself.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:11.806
Only then will you have
what you need.

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:13.808
To defeat him?
No.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:16.043
To heal him.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.916
It is difficult
imagining Lamb
as a patient.

01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:27.054
Perhaps you should spend
some time where he spent
so much of his.

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:32.527
<i>Why won't you let me go?
I want to go.</i>

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:35.196
Because it's not appropriate
for a girl your age.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.632
But I'm not a girl.
I'm a lady.

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:40.601
Quite beautiful one,
mind you.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:43.137
You should see
how the boys stare at me.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:46.007
Listen to me, Millie.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.543
<i>You must stay in this room
with the door locked</i>

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.978
until I return,
do you understand?

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.181
You just want to leave me here
so you can run away with him,
don't you?

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:57.885
Who?
Dr. Newgate.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:04.058
Millie, that's absurd.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.227
You're going to run away
with him and you're going
to leave me here

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:09.964
to wipe bums
and empty bedpans,
and it's not fair.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:11.699
Oh, no.
Sh.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.902
There, there.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:18.773
Eliza?

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:21.075
Yes, darling.

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:26.247
What's it like?
What's what like?

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.985
To be in love?

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.038
You're the belle
of the ball.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
You're the belle
of the ball.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.913
You look beautiful.

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:39.720
I suppose
you've come
to ask me to dance.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:42.189
Believe me,
nothing would
please me more.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:49.063
But there isn't time.

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:51.365
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:54.301
There's something
I must do, and if Lamb
asks you,

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:56.737
tell him I've gone outside
for some fresh air.
Now tell him.

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.406
Where are you going?

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:00.341
To find a way
to put an end
to all of this.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.309
Wait.
Edward, wait.

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:32.199
Dinner is served.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.834
Dinner is served.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.096
Oh.

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:03.330
Eliza.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.908
How do you do?

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.213
Who? Me?

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:20.881
Why, I'd be delighted.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.558
<i>May I butt in?</i>

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.596
Well, well.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:39.400
What a beautiful dress.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:42.203
<i>And lovely shoes.</i>

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:19.967
<i>Think of him
as a patient.</i>

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:23.137
<i>Shine the light
of your sympathy</i>

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:26.440
<i>into the darkest
corners of his mind,</i>

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:31.211
<i>and maybe then you'll find</i>
<i>what he so desperately wants</i>
<i>to keep hidden from you</i>

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.715
<i>and from himself.</i>

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.666
No.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:36.744
Pleurisy, I suspect.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.147
<i>Brought on by catarrh.</i>

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:41.682
The...

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:47.287
The poor
child's heart
gave out.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.662
Take the body
upstairs, would you?

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:59.299
No.
Do not touch her.

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.495
She's gone
to a better place.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:30.364
No.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:32.800
This was supposed to be
a better place.

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:44.611
It is nearly midnight.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.682
Someone.

01:24:48.684 --> 01:24:52.586
You.
Fetch the champagne.
Bring it here, quickly.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:55.189
<i>All of my friends.</i>

01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:57.357
<i>Join me outside.</i>

01:24:57.359 --> 01:24:59.560
The new century
is nearly upon us.

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.424
<i>Peter!</i>

01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:32.659
Where's Peter?

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:36.130
Peter, my pyromaniac friend.

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:37.698
You may do the honors.

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:46.607
<i>Tonight</i>
<i>we shall warm</i>
<i>ourselves</i>

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:49.877
<i>by the fire</i>

01:25:49.879 --> 01:25:51.812
of our ignominious past.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.652
<i>Are you quite
finished there, Ted?</i>

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:37.524
Spiking the bubbly,
I mean.

01:26:39.495 --> 01:26:42.462
You're slipping
them all a Mickey Finn.

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:48.602
Not if Mickey Finn
slips you one first.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.908
Well, I wasn't
expecting that.

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.944
Ah!

01:26:56.946 --> 01:26:59.546
Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.847
That's the other one!

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.636
Come on.
Come on.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.520
Now, now, Ted.

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.771
<i>Doctor.</i>

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:06.740
You're just in time.

01:29:06.742 --> 01:29:08.575
Indeed.

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.122
Ah, there you are.

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.532
<i>There we are.</i>

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.654
Won't you be
joining us, Doctor?

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.507
Of course.

01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:42.576
Allow me.

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.420
Ten,

01:29:53.422 --> 01:29:54.721
nine,

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.089
eight,

01:29:56.091 --> 01:29:59.126
seven, six,

01:29:59.128 --> 01:30:02.829
five, four,

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:06.433
three, two,

01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:08.168
one.

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:10.137
<i>Stop!</i>

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.974
Stop!

01:30:13.976 --> 01:30:17.911
Don't drink
the fecking champagne!

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.887
<i>Believe nothing
that you hear</i>

01:30:26.889 --> 01:30:28.849
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:38.965
Welcome back, Ted.

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:03.523
There, have a little rest
while we set the stage.

01:31:03.525 --> 01:31:06.685
I'll be back
in two shakes
of a whore's tail.

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.470
<i>Come on.</i>

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.045
<i>Dear friends.</i>

01:31:25.047 --> 01:31:26.947
A few hours ago

01:31:26.949 --> 01:31:30.116
we celebrated
the arrival
of a new century,

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:33.019
and in a few hours more,

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:36.990
we shall celebrate
the dawning of a new day

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:41.127
in this,
the grand experiment

01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:43.563
we have been
conducting together.

01:31:57.044 --> 01:32:00.013
Oh, Eliza.
Oh, thank God.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:02.215
Please help me
undo these straps.

01:32:02.217 --> 01:32:04.551
Please.

01:32:04.553 --> 01:32:06.720
Eliza.

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:16.930
It was found
on your person.

01:32:16.932 --> 01:32:19.766
Why did you come here?

01:32:19.768 --> 01:32:21.935
You know why I came here,
to study asylum medicine.

01:32:21.937 --> 01:32:24.170
You're a liar.
He sent you.

01:32:24.172 --> 01:32:26.172
Who?
My husband.

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:29.175
To take me
back to him.
No.

01:32:29.177 --> 01:32:31.311
I don't believe you.

01:32:31.313 --> 01:32:33.013
Why did you come here?

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.682
I...

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.185
I came here for you.

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:43.657
For me?
Why?

01:32:43.659 --> 01:32:46.159
I-I saw you

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.131
six months ago
at a medical lecture.

01:32:51.133 --> 01:32:53.266
<i>I saw you.</i>

01:32:53.268 --> 01:32:55.669
You were there?

01:32:55.671 --> 01:32:57.704
Help me.
One of you.
Please, I'm not mad.

01:32:57.706 --> 01:33:00.106
<i>You looked so lost
and so beautiful.</i>

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:03.577
<i>It sickened me</i>
<i>to see you exhibited</i>
<i>like a sideshow freak.</i>

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:05.745
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.081
<i>I would have stopped it
if I could, but I couldn't.</i>

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:10.717
I-I couldn't.

01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:13.753
<i>So, I vowed
there and then</i>

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:16.723
that I would find you
and that nothing would
stop me.

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.833
Did you even know
my name?

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:24.698
It didn't matter.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.933
No, it does matter.

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.102
Saying otherwise
proves you're no better
than any of them.

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:30.870
Than who?

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:32.973
My family,

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:35.175
my doctors,
my husband.

01:33:35.177 --> 01:33:39.312
You act like
I'm some precious
thing to be bartered

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.348
or put on display
or possessed.

01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:43.917
It-It's not like that
with me, Eliza.

01:33:43.919 --> 01:33:45.619
No?

01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:47.253
How is it different?

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:55.161
It's you
who possesses me.

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:01.635
<i>Excuse us, your Ladyship.</i>

01:34:01.637 --> 01:34:03.303
<i>You must
get out of here.</i>

01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:05.672
Go, please.
Ride to the village.
Please.

01:34:05.674 --> 01:34:07.674
Time for Ted's
big debut.
Eliza, promise me.

01:34:07.676 --> 01:34:09.409
<i>Promise me.
Promise me.</i>

01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:12.045
Eliza.
Eliza!

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:19.285
<i>Tonight
we will show mercy</i>

01:34:19.287 --> 01:34:21.388
to a man
who has betrayed us,

01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:24.391
and through the miracle
of medical science

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:26.960
we make him
in our image.

01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:29.996
And when we are done,
he'll not need to be locked
below in a dungeon

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:33.233
like the criminal he was,
but will join us

01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:35.935
up above in the light,

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:38.138
fully rehabilitated.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.775
And we shall embrace him
as one of our own.

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.747
<i>Pity.</i>

01:34:47.749 --> 01:34:50.250
You would have made
a fine asylum doctor.

01:34:50.252 --> 01:34:52.318
You showed
a rare talent for it.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.187
You're mad.

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:59.225
We're all mad,
Dr. Newgate.

01:34:59.227 --> 01:35:01.928
Some are simply
not mad enough
to admit it.

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:05.398
Crank it up, Finn.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.466
Now.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.108
We will start

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:18.712
with a dose
of ten seconds.

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:23.049
Wait, wait, wait.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.786
Before you start,
I'd like a final request.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.724
In my vest pocket

01:35:30.726 --> 01:35:33.793
there's a picture
of Eliza Graves.

01:35:33.795 --> 01:35:36.155
I'd like her
to have it.

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.501
Very well.

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.763
Silas.

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.303
<i>Silas.</i>

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.274
Silas!

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.251
Keep going.

01:36:31.253 --> 01:36:34.020
<i>Faster.
Faster!</i>

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.893
Feck, I don't need you.
I'll do it me self.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:53.173
Eliza.
Eliza, my feet.

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.011
Hurry.

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:02.315
Eliza!

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.586
Eliza!

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:13.526
Eliza.

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:15.995
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:18.198
Look at me.

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:44.991
Hit the switch.
Hit the switch.

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.297
Quick, my hands.

01:38:24.299 --> 01:38:26.065
<i>Eliza.
Untie me.</i>

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:27.267
Quick, my hands.

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:33.439
Everybody out!
Evacuate the building!

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:34.674
Evacuate!

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:41.080
Take these keys
and set them free.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:42.802
Where are you going?
To find Lamb.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.419
Everybody outside!

01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:12.532
Go that way.
Keep going.

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:17.283
Go that way.
Keep going.

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:18.418
Quickly.

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:42.976
Please help, Dr. Lamb.

01:39:42.978 --> 01:39:45.578
Please help, Dr. Lamb.

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:57.256
<i>Dr. Lamb.</i>

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:33.626
They were suffering, so...

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:35.395
And I...

01:40:35.397 --> 01:40:37.397
And I...

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:44.270
It's over, Silas.

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:50.143
I saved them.
I know.
I know.

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.513
I saved them all.
I know.

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:59.318
The war,
it's over, Silas.

01:41:04.759 --> 01:41:06.426
There you go.

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.731
<i>Ladies.</i>

01:41:11.733 --> 01:41:14.667
Let's start
putting the patients
in the far wing.

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:20.840
William.
William, you may come
with me now.

01:41:20.842 --> 01:41:23.276
Yes, Mrs. Pike.
Come.

01:41:26.147 --> 01:41:28.081
Inside.

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:31.384
<i>Eliza.</i>

01:41:31.386 --> 01:41:33.853
Eliza.
Eliza.

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.495
Down here.

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:47.567
Silas.

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.636
Can you hear me?

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:53.306
Silas.

01:41:53.308 --> 01:41:55.241
<i>Eliza, he's gone.</i>

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:58.111
<i>Eliza.</i>

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.633
We could leave now.

01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:23.903
Edward, I can't.

01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:26.172
You can't what?

01:42:26.174 --> 01:42:31.577
I can't imagine
being anywhere
but here.

01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:34.579
You can't...
I'm quite sure
you don't mean that.

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:37.650
Yes.

01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:40.653
Because you are sane

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:42.855
and I am not.

01:42:42.857 --> 01:42:44.924
I'm not sane.

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.941
I'm madly in love
with you.

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:10.616
Eliza, listen to me.

01:43:10.618 --> 01:43:14.487
Listen to me.
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:43:14.489 --> 01:43:18.324
I should've told you
right from the beginning,
but I was too afraid.

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:21.827
Eliza...

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:38.277
Inexcusable this.

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.614
<i>No way to run
an asylum.</i>

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:47.220
Dear God.

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:55.595
You realize
we've been ringing for over
a quarter of an hour.

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:00.466
We need to speak
with your superintendent
at once

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:01.628
on a matter
of utmost urgency.

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.771
No.
What?

01:44:05.773 --> 01:44:08.908
We can't speak with him?
Well, why the devil not?

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:14.247
There you are, dear.

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:22.388
Tea, Benjamin.

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:29.362
<i>Sodomite.</i>

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.402
Am I to understand
it is you who is
in charge here, Madam?

01:44:36.404 --> 01:44:38.638
It is.

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:43.609
Highly irregular.

01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:44.944
No mind.

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:49.949
And what is this, sir?

01:44:49.951 --> 01:44:53.619
Release papers
instructing you to discharge
a former patient of mine

01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:56.656
named Eliza Graves
and remit her to our
custody.

01:44:56.658 --> 01:44:58.658
I'm afraid
I cannot, sir.

01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.427
What?
Why not?

01:45:01.429 --> 01:45:04.397
Because she was discharged
three weeks ago.

01:45:04.399 --> 01:45:06.599
On whose orders?

01:45:06.601 --> 01:45:08.567
Dr. Newgate's.

01:45:08.569 --> 01:45:11.003
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:13.773
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

01:45:13.775 --> 01:45:16.676
That's impossible.
Why?

01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:20.713
Because, my good woman,
I am Dr. Edward Newgate.

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:27.386
It's as I feared.
We're too late.

01:45:27.388 --> 01:45:30.323
<i>Would someone please tell
me what's going on?</i>

01:45:30.325 --> 01:45:33.492
The young man
you knew as Dr. Newgate

01:45:33.494 --> 01:45:35.728
is neither
a Newgate
nor a doctor.

01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:37.863
How silly.
Of course he was a doctor.

01:45:37.865 --> 01:45:39.665
I can assure you, madame,
he is not.

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:45.638
Well, who is he then?

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.874
A very cunning
and disturbed patient

01:45:48.876 --> 01:45:51.711
who until two months ago
was under my care

01:45:51.713 --> 01:45:54.413
at Bethlehem
Royal Hospital
in London.

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:58.417
Forgive me,
but that makes
no sense, Doctor.

01:45:58.419 --> 01:46:02.388
Why would he go to the trouble
of escaping from one asylum
only to enter another?

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:06.459
To find my wife.

01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:09.061
<i>Next patient.
Any questions?</i>

01:46:09.063 --> 01:46:12.598
<i>It seems he became</i>
<i>unduly infatuated</i>
<i>with Lady Graves</i>

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.967
<i>at a medical demonstration
I gave at Oxford.</i>

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:29.548
<i>Some time after that,</i>
<i>he managed to escape</i>
<i>his room,</i>

01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:34.920
<i>elude two orderlies, and flee
via a laundry chute,</i>

01:46:34.922 --> 01:46:38.524
<i>in the process
stealing my pocket watch,</i>

01:46:38.526 --> 01:46:41.794
<i>my Derringer, and my, uh...</i>

01:46:41.796 --> 01:46:43.796
Identity.

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.433
In any event,
suffice it to say,

01:46:47.435 --> 01:46:49.001
he's a very disturbed
young man.

01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:52.738
He suffers
from Pseudologia fantastica,

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.975
<i>one of the most severe
cases I've ever encountered.</i>

01:46:55.977 --> 01:46:57.977
<i>In all the years
I've known him,</i>

01:46:57.979 --> 01:47:00.379
<i>I've never uncovered
his true identity.</i>

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:04.750
<i>It could very well be
that he's an empty shell</i>

01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:07.052
<i>incapable
of true feeling</i>

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.956
beyond a cure.

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:15.094
Check

01:47:15.096 --> 01:47:17.196
mate.

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:24.770
<i>You'll excuse me
if I disagree, Doctor.</i>

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:27.540
<i>No one is beyond cure.</i>

01:47:27.542 --> 01:47:31.577
<i>In fact, I believe</i>
<i>your young man</i>
<i>has found his.</i>

01:47:31.579 --> 01:47:35.181
<i>What precisely
might that be?</i>

01:47:35.183 --> 01:47:38.818
<i>Not what.
Who.</i>

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.065
Shall we, Mrs. Lamb?

01:47:53.067 --> 01:47:55.134
With pleasure, Dr. Lamb.
