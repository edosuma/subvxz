Thank you for clicking on this link.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.400
You are using the internet
to view pornography.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.000
Would you like your wife
and children to find out about this?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.480
Of course you wouldn't.

00:14.480 --> 00:18.280
You can stop this happening
by sending just $3,000,

00:18.280 --> 00:20.160
paid in Bitcoin to...

00:20.160 --> 00:21.200
Hold on.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.720
This is dodgy.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.760
What's the problem, Steven?
This is blackmail.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.160
Some cyber-snoop, blackmailing poor
chaps innocently browsing porn.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.080
So? Well, blackmail's illegal.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.480
Steven, this is Clem Fandango,
can you hear me?

00:37.480 --> 00:40.120
OK, handsome has come
as the Milk Tray man.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.880
I'm referring to the rope. You're not
going to hang yourself, are you?

00:43.880 --> 00:47.320
It's for slack rope walking.
We do it most Wednesday afternoons.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.040
Slack what? Slack Alice, more like.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.160
Ha!

00:53.760 --> 00:55.120
No, we just head to the park,

00:55.120 --> 00:58.320
sling a rope between a couple
of trees a few feet off the ground.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.360
It's like tightrope walking
but low risk and bouncier.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.080
Hang on a second.

01:03.080 --> 01:07.080
What if someone susses that it's my voice
threatening these poor unfortunates?

01:07.080 --> 01:09.400
As long as they don't see your face,
I think you'll be fine, Steven.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.240
Oh, right, so you're a lawyer now,
are you, as well as an acrobat?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.360
Honestly, Steven, relax.
It's all above board.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.720
Is there CCTV in here?
Yes.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.760
Well, then, I'm off,
I'm not doing this.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.400
I'm not going to jail
for you two prats.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.400
LA prisons are crowded enough
as it is, with all the robberies

01:26.400 --> 01:29.400
and murders and... Kidnappings.
Kidnappings, exactly.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.040
If you don't finish the job, though,
Steven, the client won't pay.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.400
I couldn't give a fuck's house
and do you know why?

01:34.400 --> 01:37.760
Because today is my first day
on the new Star Wars movie.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.080
Mm. Yeah, sure.

01:39.080 --> 01:43.280
Yeah? And I know it'll open
plenty of doors for moi.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.200
So, there's a fair chance this
could be my last ever voice-over.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.760
That'd be such a shame.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.000
I mean, it's always been so great
working with you, Steven,

01:52.000 --> 01:53.640
hasn't it, Clem? Sure has, yeah.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.520
You two are so full of shit
your eyes are turning brown.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.120
You despise me nearly
as much as I do you. Yeah?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.240
You can stick your voice-overs
up your ponies

02:02.240 --> 02:04.720
because you'll never see me again.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.000
Stay safe out there, Steven.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.560
When I met him two weeks ago,
he seemed totally fine.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.600
How can someone just suddenly die?

03:01.600 --> 03:04.080
Who are you talking about?
My friend, Kelsey Perfume.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.880
He dropped dead last week.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.720
If they got to him, then that means
they might soon be onto me.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.640
I don't care about any of that.
I'm filming Star Wars today, finally.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.160
My car should be here at any moment.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.720
Toast, what's your fake name? What?

03:21.720 --> 03:24.680
If a cop stops you for something,
what name do you give them?

03:24.680 --> 03:28.800
Well, my own name, of course.
No, man, always give them a fake name.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.760
I've got a couple that I use.
Like what?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.320
Frank Succession. Tycoon Lancaster.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.600
Jesus Bond. Russ Nightlife.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.760
August Burdock. Clint Legal.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.760
You just said Russ Nightlife. Did I?

03:40.760 --> 03:44.200
Yes. Is your real name not
Russ Nightlife?

03:44.200 --> 03:45.880
Sure it is.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.680
Is your real name Steven Toast?

03:49.680 --> 03:52.920
Yes, of course. Yeah. Sure.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.800
Where the hell is my car?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.040
Maybe you should call them.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.640
Hello, you're talking to Sorry.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.560
I use the pronouns
She, Her and Here.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.360
I'm one of the production
coordinators

04:10.360 --> 04:12.280
on the new Star Wars movie,
Force The Wind.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.080
How may I help you today?

04:14.080 --> 04:18.440
What's your name, sorry? Sorry,
yes, that is my name. Sorry Johnson.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.800
Johnson, no. My name's Toast.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.960
Look, I'm one of the main actors
in the film you're shooting today.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.640
Where's my car?

04:25.640 --> 04:29.360
Um, so we're not exactly sure
when that would be.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.000
Things are a little uncertain
right now due to the producers

04:32.000 --> 04:33.880
trying to co-ordinate
an onset visit

04:33.880 --> 04:37.920
by Her Royal Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II of England.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.680
The Queen, you say? Yes.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.480
I have your phone number
on file right here, Stuart,

04:43.480 --> 04:45.720
I can give you a call
when we have more information.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.400
It's Steven.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.080
Ah, well, things have gone
a little more complicated.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.960
The Queen is due to visit set.
Who gives a shit?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.320
Well, I've never met the Queen.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.400
I once had a brief affair with
her late sister,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.920
the Princess Margaret,
but she was a handful.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.440
I'll have a cappuccino.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.640
You what? You asked me
if I wanted a coffee.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.960
No, I didn't.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.440
Yeah, you said you'd walk over
to the new coffee place

05:10.440 --> 05:12.000
just around the corner.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.240
No, I didn't.
I'm waiting for my car.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.720
I couldn't help but notice, Toast,

05:15.720 --> 05:18.600
that you're a little late with
the rent this month.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.960

05:20.960 --> 05:23.520

I'm sorry, what was that?
Nothing.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.880
How long will this take? Uh, no,
I don't know, it's a new joint.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.040
I'm guessing it's real busy.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.120
Ohh!

05:50.120 --> 05:52.720
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

05:54.040 --> 05:59.040
OK, buddy,
everything's going to be just fine.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.480
Take his hood off.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.840
Listen, before we cut off your ear,

06:04.840 --> 06:06.880
I want you to call your family

06:06.880 --> 06:08.200
and tell them what's happened.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.600
A, I don't have a family.
Hey, Tom, I don't...

06:11.600 --> 06:13.440
Will you shut up, Wallace?

06:13.440 --> 06:18.160
We're on a tight schedule, remember?
But I... What the hell is it, man?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.440
I don't think this is him.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.760
I think we've got the wrong guy.
You what?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.840
Oh, Jesus Christ!

06:32.480 --> 06:34.920
Is this a moving truck?
Let's get him out of here.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.200
What the...? Whoa!

06:47.680 --> 06:49.240
Forgive me for taking a while,

06:49.240 --> 06:52.440
but I was the victim
of an intended kidnapping.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.000
Oh.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.600
The crimewave in this town
is getting ridiculous.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.960
Why are you eating newspaper? I eat
newspaper when I'm anxious.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.040
Why? What am I, a shrink?

07:02.040 --> 07:04.920
I'm nervous about Kelsey Perfume.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.360
They got him, they're going to come
for me next. It just doesn't add up.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.880
He was a fit guy, couldn't have been
more than 70, 80 years old.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.760
You don't just drop dead like that.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.160
Well, he was no spring chicken.
Chicken? What?

07:18.280 --> 07:21.160
They say he had a lot of enemies
in the San Francisco Mafia,

07:21.160 --> 07:24.240
especially after he took a shit
on Tony de Bruzzio's doorstep.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.200
But I don't think it was the mob
that got to him.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.440
I think it was the feds.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.400
Hey, will you get that, Toast?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.600
Quickly. All right.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.360
Hello. Hello, Mr Steven Toast?

07:41.360 --> 07:43.760
Sorry, I need to give you
some information.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.400
Sorry, who is this?
I am Sorry. What, why?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.480
I'm Sorry,
from the production office.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.480
Right. Sorry, yes.
Now I understand. Where's my car?

07:55.480 --> 07:58.760
OK, so, unfortunately, we won't be
getting to your scene today.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.000
You what?

08:17.640 --> 08:19.160
Something happen?

08:19.160 --> 08:22.080
They say they won't get around
to shooting my scene today.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.160
Do you know where Billy is? No.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.960
She's been acting real odd,
asking loads of questions.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.480
Googling stuff on her LA P-top.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.680
Don't you mean laptop?

08:35.760 --> 08:39.360
I thought they were called LA P-tops
because they were invented in LA.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.160
No, they're called laptops
because they go on your lap.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.160
I thought I heard Billy on the phone
last week speaking English.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.760
Did you hear that?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.240
No.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.880
I mean, she could have picked it up
from somebody. What?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.960
You don't just pick up English
by hearing someone speak it.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.560
You have to learn it from books.

09:00.120 --> 09:05.560
If you hear her speaking English...
you tell me, all right? OK.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.000
I'm going out.
Yeah, I gathered that.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.560
Hang on,
you never leave the apartment.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.800
I want to see if I can find out more
about what happened

09:13.800 --> 09:15.360
to Kelsey Perfume.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.640
Jane? Morning, Toast.
Or whatever time it is there.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.080
Why are you calling me, Jane?

09:29.080 --> 09:32.520
Just to wish you all
the best for the Star Wars shoot.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.320
I sent a bottle of whisky to the set

09:34.320 --> 09:37.680
for you to enjoy with your new
Tinseltown friends.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.720
Right. But, just remember,
drink sensibly.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.960
Hold on, Jane.

09:45.080 --> 09:49.320
And, whatever you do,
don't mess this up.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.920
Sorry, Jane, I've got to go.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.680
Bloody hell, a coffin?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.960
Yeah. Give me a hand opening it up.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.120
I'm not touching that.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.080
All right, we're coming in, Kelsey.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.960
Jesus. I wonder what he found
so funny.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.720
Ugh.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.960
Nope, I don't see any sign
of foul play there.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.160
I guess I overreacted.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.000
You know, Toast,
we've got to rebury Kelsey.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.920
Can't have a body in the apartment.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.280
I mean, imagine
if the feds found it, right?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.360
If you think I'm going
to rebury this coffin,

10:50.360 --> 10:52.320
then you've got
another think coming.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.400
You know, I wonder
if I would talk that way

10:57.400 --> 11:00.400
if I owed someone $6,000 in rent.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.240
All right.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.880
There. What was so bad about that?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.160
You're a fucking lunatic, Nightlife.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.080
I can't wait for my Star Wars film
to smash.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.720
Then I'll move out of your nuthouse

11:21.720 --> 11:24.360
and into a massive mansion
in the Hollywood Hills.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.720
It's me again, you fucking morons.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.320
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
Again?

11:39.320 --> 11:41.840
You two pricks need to let me out, now.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.840
Whoa!

11:54.520 --> 11:56.760
<i>This is no way to prepare</i>

11:56.760 --> 12:00.400
<i>for my role in a major science
fiction motion picture franchise.</i>

12:01.520 --> 12:03.200
I'm going to need a new jacket.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.920
Shit.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.400
Jesus.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.680
A parachute?

12:54.680 --> 12:56.840
What the...?

13:25.640 --> 13:26.880
Hello?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.400
<i>Toast, it's Ed.</i>

13:28.400 --> 13:32.240
<i>Listen, I've just seen a fascinating
documentary on the BBC.</i>

13:32.240 --> 13:34.640
It's about a criminal
who hijacked an aeroplane,

13:34.640 --> 13:37.400
threatened to blow it up,
got loads of ransom money,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.960
then jumped out of the plane
never to be seen again.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.640
Reminded me very much of your
strange roommate, Russ Nightlife.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.320
Well, that is fascinating, Ed.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.720
Tell me, did he have an accomplice
named Kelsey Perfume?

13:49.720 --> 13:50.880
No.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.720
Well, then, it's the mob.
What's that?

13:53.720 --> 13:55.200
Hold on.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.000
What the hell, Billy?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.400
Toast, I didn't think you'd be here,

13:58.400 --> 14:01.040
you're supposed to be on the
movie set. What is your name, sir?

14:02.120 --> 14:03.280
Jesus Bond.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.000
It's OK, John, he's not a suspect.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.760
He's a British actor who's here to
star in the latest Star Wars movie.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.280
Yeah, sure.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.040
Look, I feel pretty stressed.
What's this about?

14:14.040 --> 14:16.240
Look, Toast, I haven't been
completely honest with you.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.680
I'm actually an undercover agent
with the FBI. You're a what?

14:18.680 --> 14:21.800
We suspect Russ Nightlife,
that's not his real name, by the way,

14:21.800 --> 14:24.440
is actually involved in
a major criminal incident. Really?

14:24.440 --> 14:25.680
We don't have much evidence,

14:25.680 --> 14:28.360
but he did use a fake ID
at a liquor store downtown.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.440
OK. We're going to bring him
in for questioning.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.560
I always said he was bloody odd.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.040
Talking of clear evidence,
I don't know if this will be of any

14:35.040 --> 14:38.640
use to you, but I've just been in his
bedroom and I found a parachute...

14:38.640 --> 14:42.440
You what? ...a briefcase full
of rolled-up banknotes... Really?

14:42.440 --> 14:46.760
...a newspaper report indicating that
he'd hijacked an aeroplane... OK.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.200
...a gun and 50 rounds
of ammunition. We got him!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stay right there.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.960
ED: <i>Toast?
</i>What exactly is happening there?

14:56.960 --> 14:59.520
Sorry, Ed, I didn't realise
you were still on the line.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.080
I can't talk now, we'll speak soon.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.360
Why isn't Billy in trouble?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.960
You speak English?

15:03.960 --> 15:06.360
What? Toast, it's Blair.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.960
I need to talk to you about
that money that you owe me.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.800
Toast?

15:10.800 --> 15:13.480
Toast, just to inform you,
your apartment's now a crime scene,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.200
so you're going to have to scram for
a few days. You got somewhere to go?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.280
I want to talk to my lawyer. I suppose
they could put me up in a fancy hotel.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.880
Who? The Star Wars people.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.920
It's the entire reason why
I'm in LA,

15:22.920 --> 15:25.240
I'm starring in the new
Star Wars movie.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.840
Yeah, sure.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.480
I suppose I could go for a stroll.

15:29.480 --> 15:33.240
Nobody just goes for a stroll in LA,
especially not during a crimewave.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.160
I'll be fine. I'm a big enough boy.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.720
Hey, Toast.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.800
Good luck.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.680
Thanks, Billy. I'm not Billy.
My real name is Millie.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.440
Nothing is ever as it appears
in this crazy old town

15:49.440 --> 15:50.520
they call Tinsel.

15:51.640 --> 15:52.880
Tinseltown.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.640
Good luck, Millie.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.320
Bad luck, Nightlife.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.760
My name is Orson.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.200
May I see your invitation, please?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.440
I don't have one.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.720
Though I am starring
in the new Star Wars movie.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
Yeah, sure.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.000
Come in anyway.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.800
I, too, am an actor by profession.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.240
I've also dabbled in direction
and production.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.400
Some of my motion pictures
have won prestigious awards.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.880
Yeah, sure.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.080
But, last year...

17:01.080 --> 17:02.920
...I discovered wine.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.360
And it's pretty much
taken over my life.

17:05.360 --> 17:09.080
I should say it has.
I take it you drink wine?

17:09.080 --> 17:11.960
Right now, my friend,
I'd drink anything.

17:11.960 --> 17:17.440
Try some deux mille dix-sept Patient
Cottat Anciennes Vignes Sancerre.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.680
Good Lord, is that wine?

17:19.760 --> 17:20.960
Yes, it is.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.200
Just spit it onto the floor,
I'll clean it up later.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.560
Have some more.
In for a penny...

17:36.560 --> 17:38.720
That's a Bandol Rouge.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.280
It's an excellent vintage.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.760
I say, any chance
I can swallow some of this?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.680
I did actually come in here
for a drink.

17:46.680 --> 17:49.320
Oh.
I should have mentioned earlier,

17:49.320 --> 17:52.600
we also have another British actor
here with us today.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.960
Would you care to meet him?

17:53.960 --> 17:58.400
You've what? I say, sir,
you in the white safari suit.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.560
White suit?

18:00.560 --> 18:03.040
Well, that could only be one man.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.040
Ray bloody Purchase.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.640
Steven Gonville Toast.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.360
Well, well, well.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.480
I should have known.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.880
Couldn't resist the offer of
free booze, could you, Toast?

18:24.880 --> 18:27.320
I thought I'd seen you around town.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.640
What are you doing here,
you cheap bastard?

18:29.640 --> 18:30.760
Last time I did see you,

18:30.760 --> 18:33.800
you were flying through
the window of a London club.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.760
Why aren't your legs broken?

18:35.760 --> 18:39.520
I have particularly rubbery legs.
They don't break easily.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.520
Meh. Eh.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.880
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

18:43.880 --> 18:47.400
I have acquired the best agent
in Hollywood, Toast.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.000
And I'm actually working...
unlike you,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.840
judging by the state of your jacket.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.760
Fellows, would you mind if I filmed
something for our website

18:57.760 --> 19:01.480
of you two gentlemen
enjoying our wine?

19:01.480 --> 19:06.600
Why not?
The Bandol Rouge is sensational.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.960
Oh, and, Toast, you get
a drop of wine on my holiday suit,

19:09.960 --> 19:11.440
I will send you the bill.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.560
Right, let's get on with it.
Ready.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.400
Enjoy the wine.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.000
Wonderful. This is
the Riserva Chianti, from Italy.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.680
20 years old.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.800
Beautiful.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.600
Keep going, drink more.
This is the Chateau Angludet.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.160
Riserva Chianti, 1974.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.280
Yeah, savour the flavours.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.120
Peaches, bergamot,
vineyards of ecstasy.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.280
What's next?

19:52.280 --> 19:54.680
Chateau Lafite. Cheers.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.600
1941.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.320
A day without wine
is a day without sun.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.800
Time is a thief to fortune.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.440
What can one say?

20:15.840 --> 20:18.000
I've got a bit of a taste
for this now.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.920
I can't get enough of that.

20:22.920 --> 20:23.960
Superb.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.760
Gentlemen, my time here is done.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.000
You're going? All right.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.640
Hold your horses.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.160
Hold on, phone.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.000
Toast.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.920
Good afternoon, my name is Sorry,

21:00.920 --> 21:03.160
I'm one of the production
coordinators

21:03.160 --> 21:04.680
on the new Star Wars movie...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.040
Yes, I know. ...Force The Wind.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.760
Yes, I know.
We need you on set in half an hour.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.840
Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II
of England is visiting us

21:14.840 --> 21:18.280
during her trip to LA and
we've had to change things around.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.440
Half an hour? Yes.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.960
And would you be able to make
your own way out here?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.920
All of our drivers are busy
at the moment.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.520
Thanks for everything, Orson.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.320
Taxi!

21:40.160 --> 21:42.280
It's me. I'm here.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.880
Excuse me, who are you, sir?
Steven Toast. Are you...? Oh, I'm Sorry.

21:45.880 --> 21:50.280
Well, so you bloody should be.
The taxi cost me $150.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.400
Now, where am I going?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
Excuse me, Mr Toast, um,
you haven't been drinking, have you?

21:55.400 --> 21:58.960
Well, I might have had a couple
of glasses of Bandol Rouge.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.480
But I'm as sober as a judge
and ready for action.

22:01.480 --> 22:05.720
OK. Um, just looking at the
schedule here, um, yeah,

22:05.720 --> 22:07.960
things are still a little disrupted
due to the

22:07.960 --> 22:11.800
visit of Her Majesty the Queen
of England to the set. Right.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.640
However, our updated schedule
tells me that you will be needed,

22:15.640 --> 22:18.240
uh, let me see...

22:20.080 --> 22:22.280
Yes, 7:30.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.600
That's five hours away.

22:24.600 --> 22:29.920
Well, it's actually 7:30am,
so that is 17 hours away.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.680
17 hours. What the hell
am I going to do for 17 hours?

22:33.680 --> 22:37.480
Oh, that's your trailer right there,
you can hang out, if you want.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.720
Oh, God. Amazing, thank you, Stuart.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.320
Stuart? It's Steven.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.080
Uh, Mr Toast? Yeah, yeah!

23:08.080 --> 23:12.480
Mr Toast, um, I'm afraid there's
been another change to the schedule.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.360
Oh, not again. What time is it?

23:14.360 --> 23:15.840
It's 4:40pm

23:15.840 --> 23:20.120
and your on-set time has been
brought forward by 15 hours.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.160
So when am I on? Now.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.320
Shit.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.800
Oh, my God. This is our producer,
Mr Doobla-Decca.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.280
He'd like to discuss
what he wants from you today.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.760
Ah, we meet at last.
Steven Toast. Neil.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.000
It is a huge honour to be part
of the Star Wars canon.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
I am your obedient servant.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.040
No, my name is Neil.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.760
Neil Doobla-Decca.
There's really no need to...

23:45.760 --> 23:47.800
Neil? Oh, forgive me,
I misunderstood.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.360
Apologies, Steven, that's our director,
Hawk Fahrenheit.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.200
He wants a word. I'll be right back.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.480
I think the Queen's arrived.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.240
Sorry. Yes?

23:58.240 --> 24:02.280
I was talking to Toast. Her Majesty
the Queen has just arrived.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.880
We told her there's a Brit on set
today and she's keen to meet him.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.760
Fantastic. Now, has anybody
told you about your role?

24:07.760 --> 24:10.040
No, no, I don't know anything.
I haven't even read a script.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.520
OK, well, uh,
Hawk will run it through with you.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.080
Jesus.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.640
What's that smell?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.280
It's like gasoline.

24:19.280 --> 24:23.520
Sorry? Yes. Can you get a script
for Steven? Absolutely.

24:23.520 --> 24:27.040
Um, you know I'm so exc...
I can't wait to do this.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.400
Pretty cool to be part
of a Star Wars movie, right?

24:30.400 --> 24:33.560
<i>At last, I've made it.
I've bloody made it.</i>

24:33.560 --> 24:36.720
<i>This is the best moment of my life.</i>

24:38.000 --> 24:40.560
And I will destroy you

24:40.560 --> 24:43.480
and all the people from your planet

24:43.480 --> 24:48.160
when I release a big wind
to blow you all away.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.880
Force the wind!

24:53.080 --> 24:55.800
Die, you tyrant!
Good will always conquer evil.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.760
No!

24:57.760 --> 24:58.880
Ray bloody Purchase?

25:07.520 --> 25:09.560
Cut. That was great.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.840
Uh, Mr Toast? Hi, our producer,
Mr Neil Doobla-Decca, thought

25:14.840 --> 25:18.640
he could smell alcohol on your breath,
so he'd like you to return

25:18.640 --> 25:21.600
to your trailer until the Queen
of England says her goodbyes

25:21.600 --> 25:22.960
and leaves the set.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.280
What? Thank you.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.320
Lovely to meet you.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.280
Um, this is your only scene
in the movie, right?

25:41.280 --> 25:42.520
My only scene in the movie?

25:42.520 --> 25:46.160
Of course not. Yeah, I think
it's just that one line.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.960
Thank you, Stuart.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.240
Ah, Toast.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.520
Look a bit rough.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.120
Didn't drink all that wine, did you?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.040
You do know
you're supposed to spit it out?

25:57.040 --> 26:00.000
Very amateurish.
Very unprofessional.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.320
Toast of Tinseltown, it's actually
got quite a tragic ring to it,

26:03.320 --> 26:04.960
don't you think?

26:04.960 --> 26:06.800
You total prick!

26:12.160 --> 26:14.800
This is the worst moment of my life.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.160
OK, Wallace,

26:26.160 --> 26:30.480
this better be the new star of the
latest Star Wars movie franchise,

26:30.480 --> 26:33.560
from which we can make over
a million dollars in ransom cash.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
Otherwise...

26:37.040 --> 26:39.440
Hello, again. Oh, Christ.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.520
<i>♪ Ray! ♪</i>

26:46.920 --> 26:50.760
You need to get rid of him.
Take him on the freeway again? No.

26:50.760 --> 26:54.640
I mean get rid of him for good.
Like, permanently.
