01:35.218 --> 01:38.818
In ancient times, everything was chaotic.

01:40.108 --> 01:42.068
Pangu opens up heaven and earth,

01:42.068 --> 01:44.818
Transforming into the sun, moon, rivers and mountains,

01:45.568 --> 01:48.108
Thanks to that, the world took shape.

01:50.028 --> 01:52.028
Nuwa wanted to create life

01:52.028 --> 01:54.728
Use the elemental energy to mold Clay into a human.

01:55.228 --> 01:57.728
Thanks to that, humanity was born.

02:00.528 --> 02:03.728
Before leaving the human world, Nuoa left behind a treasure.

02:03.728 --> 02:06.518
That Storm is called the "Deity Table".

02:07.528 --> 02:09.978
Nu Wa entrusted the immortal Kun Luan to protect her.

02:10.318 --> 02:12.938
This object has the Power to rotate the universe.

02:13.188 --> 02:17.188
Only the "king of the world" can open it.

02:19.728 --> 02:21.688
Each human system changes.

02:21.898 --> 02:24.068
Thanh Thang founded the Shang Dynasty.

02:24.568 --> 02:27.318
East, West, South, North, four great lords

02:27.318 --> 02:29.518
Leading eight hundred vassals

02:29.528 --> 02:33.568
Together with Thuong Vuong, he called himself "ruler of the world".

02:34.358 --> 02:35.648
Five Hundred Years Later...

02:35.978 --> 02:38.688
The Shang dynasty passed down to the De At dynasty

02:39.278 --> 02:42.858
The lord To Ho of Ky Chau refused to pay the fee

02:43.608 --> 02:46.398
declared that he would not submit to the Shang Dynasty

02:47.108 --> 02:50.688
The Shang Dynasty had to send troops to negotiate for a long time but could not

02:50.688 --> 02:54.688
Therefore, Emperor At had to have the second prince An Tho personally fight

02:55.778 --> 03:02.478
An Tho led an elite army trained by himself

04:27.728 --> 04:30.108
I am the son of Tay Ba Hau Co Xuong and Co Phat.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.818
Next to me is my closest friend, An Giao.

04:37.628 --> 04:41.178
His father is also a hero in our hearts

04:43.098 --> 04:45.748
I also really want to become someone like him.

05:05.858 --> 05:06.568
Newspaper title.

05:06.818 --> 05:08.318
Son of To Ho Ky Chau

05:08.608 --> 05:09.568
To Toan Hieu.

05:09.758 --> 05:12.478
Shout loudly in front of the crowd on the citadel.

05:17.078 --> 05:19.558
Son of To Ho Ky Chau

05:19.818 --> 05:21.388
To Toan Hieu.

05:21.648 --> 05:22.518
Title?

05:23.038 --> 05:25.578
The son of the Shang Dynasty in the North

05:25.798 --> 05:27.328
Chief Bach.

05:27.488 --> 05:29.338
What is a substance?

05:29.688 --> 05:31.518
Vassals of the four directions

05:31.528 --> 05:35.438
more than 800 vassals, will send one son as hostage to the Shang Dynasty

05:35.438 --> 05:36.978
is the substance

05:37.228 --> 05:39.398
If any vassal has any intention of rebellion

05:39.398 --> 05:41.438
Will kill the deceased first

05:41.438 --> 05:43.688
Then destroy the entire clan.

05:44.358 --> 05:48.188
Your father To Ho started a rebellion in Duc Chau

05:50.858 --> 05:53.168
You should go and give advice.

06:07.458 --> 06:13.018
Father, surrender.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.298
I've been away from home for 8 years

07:10.698 --> 07:12.798
Already mature

07:13.338 --> 07:17.258
Does your father not recognize you anymore?

07:17.668 --> 07:20.278
That person is not worthy to be your father

07:25.148 --> 07:27.018
You are my son

07:30.308 --> 07:33.898
Must be my bravest son.

07:45.478 --> 07:46.938
Father.

07:49.438 --> 07:50.568
I'm going.

08:18.118 --> 08:19.608
Right now

08:19.898 --> 08:21.228
right before your eyes

08:22.688 --> 08:24.938
One of your brothers has died

08:25.568 --> 08:27.898
One of my sons is dead.

08:28.778 --> 08:30.728
Who killed it?

08:30.728 --> 08:32.727
Traitor To Ho.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.688
Who killed it?

08:34.688 --> 08:36.227
Traitor To Ho.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.688
Who killed it?

08:38.727 --> 08:40.268
Traitor To Ho.

08:40.268 --> 08:42.268
Traitor To Ho.

08:42.268 --> 08:44.188
Traitor To Ho.

08:44.188 --> 08:45.068
Launch arrows.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.478
Shang Dynasty soldiers

09:35.478 --> 09:42.068
Binh Duc Chau.

09:45.058 --> 09:48.858
Kill.

09:48.858 --> 09:50.398
Co Phat come up.

09:53.438 --> 09:54.228
Careful.

09:58.058 --> 09:59.188
Kill.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.188
Launch arrows.

10:21.478 --> 10:23.228
Rush into the void.

10:35.398 --> 10:36.358
Kill.

10:48.438 --> 10:49.268
Stay away.

11:34.978 --> 11:36.068
Co Phat.

11:47.978 --> 11:48.568
An Giao.

11:48.568 --> 11:50.438
I haven't fought yet but...

11:50.438 --> 11:51.518
Makes me so disappointed.

11:51.528 --> 11:52.568
Parents are less angry.

11:53.318 --> 11:53.938
Master Soai

11:54.398 --> 11:55.518
We're not cowards

11:55.528 --> 11:58.228
Because the horse saw the fire and was too scared to move forward.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.598
Father.

12:06.528 --> 12:09.068
What the horse sees is up to the person to decide.

12:14.438 --> 12:15.358
Always.

12:23.688 --> 12:26.108
Kill.

13:00.648 --> 13:03.608
After destroying the citadel, we chased the To Ho family all the way

13:03.608 --> 13:05.518
All the way to Huyen Khuong.

13:05.898 --> 13:09.318
We will behead To Ho

13:09.318 --> 13:10.938
to avenge To Toan Hieu.

13:14.188 --> 13:15.848
Like like

14:17.888 --> 14:19.208
Like like.

14:22.188 --> 14:23.358
Must remember

14:23.418 --> 14:26.728
To Ho's entire family refused to submit to the Shang Dynasty.

15:09.478 --> 15:10.318
Father.

15:23.278 --> 15:24.938
Scamper.

16:24.028 --> 16:25.228
Careful.

16:57.188 --> 16:58.398
Are you a woman?

17:01.398 --> 17:02.438
Who is she?

17:03.358 --> 17:04.818
She is To Ho's daughter.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.397
To Dat Ky.

17:08.438 --> 17:09.647
The daughter of a traitor

17:10.938 --> 17:12.147
Also worthy of death.

17:13.647 --> 17:14.397
Co Phat.

17:15.938 --> 17:16.728
Kill her.

17:16.938 --> 17:17.897
Huh?

17:18.688 --> 17:19.647
Kill the woman

17:21.818 --> 17:23.147
We can't get out.

17:24.147 --> 17:25.018
Khuong Van Hoan

17:25.728 --> 17:26.397
You go up.

17:26.728 --> 17:27.268
Ngac Thuan

17:27.778 --> 17:28.397
You go up.

17:28.898 --> 17:30.228
Why don't you take action?

17:39.228 --> 17:40.728
Where is my brooch?

17:47.318 --> 17:48.588
Co Phat.

18:08.868 --> 18:10.068
This woman

18:11.038 --> 18:12.718
Killing is a waste.

18:13.328 --> 18:14.918
Or give it to the commander.

18:15.318 --> 18:16.918
A group left.

18:17.648 --> 18:18.358
De me.

18:18.468 --> 18:19.998
An Giao.

18:27.188 --> 18:28.148
Commander.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.758
marshal.

18:46.068 --> 18:48.068
Come on, let's finish this cup

18:48.278 --> 18:50.188
Respect the brave soldiers of the Shang Dynasty.

18:50.528 --> 18:52.018
Any.

18:53.228 --> 18:54.438
This cup is mine

18:55.648 --> 18:56.978
Dear our brothers

18:57.528 --> 18:58.318
To Toan Hieu.

18:59.108 --> 19:00.268
Now, respectful brother.

19:00.268 --> 19:01.028
Dear brother.

19:01.028 --> 19:03.648
To Toan Hieu is the son of traitor To Ho

19:04.028 --> 19:06.108
Not worthy to be our brother.

19:06.108 --> 19:08.398
Father is father, child is child.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.648
To Ho rebelled

19:10.938 --> 19:12.398
But To Toan Hieu never rebelled

19:12.458 --> 19:14.528
Like father, like son.

19:14.818 --> 19:17.498
Your father, the Marquis of the West, Co Xuong

19:17.858 --> 19:19.688
All day long, I only know how to farm

19:19.688 --> 19:21.728
Co Phat, you put on your armor

19:21.728 --> 19:23.818
Just a guy plowing the fields of Tay Ky

19:24.688 --> 19:26.768
My whole body smells like shit.

19:28.358 --> 19:29.898
Come on, it's a waste of wine.

19:30.438 --> 19:32.938
Your father Bac Ba Hau Chong Hau Ho

19:32.938 --> 19:36.688
All day long I only know how to hunt wolves and dogs

19:37.778 --> 19:39.148
you put on your armor

19:39.728 --> 19:40.608
It's just that

19:40.838 --> 19:42.538
an ordinary gap.

19:42.738 --> 19:44.008
What does it smell like?

19:44.148 --> 19:45.978
What's the smell?

19:46.358 --> 19:47.688
It's a rotten smell.

20:55.398 --> 20:57.228
I know what you want.

21:14.528 --> 21:15.818
What you want

21:17.028 --> 21:23.398
That is to be King of the whole world.

21:35.898 --> 21:38.478
Do you know what the consequences will be for traitors?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.988
Early tomorrow morning I will kill you to sacrifice to the flag.

21:47.898 --> 21:50.358
I'm not like someone else.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.398
I can help you.

22:29.418 --> 22:31.688
Has worked as a soldier in the Thuong Dynasty for 8 years

22:32.328 --> 22:33.328
Today

22:33.898 --> 22:36.438
can finally return as a hero

22:37.108 --> 22:40.108
Listen to the cheers from above the city

23:26.548 --> 23:30.738
Than An Tho, visit your father, Vuong brother.

23:38.478 --> 23:41.198
Please present To Ho's head to your father.

23:51.608 --> 23:55.338
The flag of Ky Chau is presented to the King.

24:02.318 --> 24:03.818
To Ho

24:04.408 --> 24:08.138
You once said you don't want to go to Thuong's house anymore

24:08.528 --> 24:09.818
What are you doing here now?

24:09.898 --> 24:11.398
Tomorrow there will be a victory party.

24:11.398 --> 24:13.188
Use this end as a wine cup

24:13.358 --> 24:14.818
Take a deep breath.

24:16.398 --> 24:23.898
Monarch of the world, long live.

24:24.728 --> 24:27.518
The Shang envoys returned victorious

24:27.528 --> 24:31.108
Especially, sword dancing brings joy to the king.

24:36.028 --> 24:37.318
Kill.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.398
marigold father.

25:01.318 --> 25:03.148
Khai Nhi

25:03.148 --> 25:06.648
Sword dance for fun Let me see.

25:07.218 --> 25:10.528
Hay.

25:52.938 --> 25:53.768
Surround.

25:55.938 --> 25:56.648
Defense.

26:39.028 --> 26:39.818
Your Highness.

26:46.478 --> 26:47.818
Dead

26:48.778 --> 26:49.938
Co Phat.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.018
You killed the great prince.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.518
That is the great crime of ethnic extermination.

26:55.478 --> 26:56.648
Co Phat.

26:58.068 --> 27:00.648
Murdered the prince right in the main hall.

27:00.648 --> 27:02.728
Impossible, must be punished.

27:02.728 --> 27:04.068
It is a great sin.

27:11.068 --> 27:12.108
Father.

27:33.858 --> 27:37.438
An Khai plotted to kill his father and was very disloyal.

27:41.348 --> 27:42.298
Co Phat.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.268
You killed him not only Innocent

27:51.098 --> 27:54.728
It is a meritorious achievement for our Dai Thuong.

28:31.838 --> 28:33.908
If there is no An Tho to pray for me

28:34.068 --> 28:35.978
Master Soi Sang Suat distinguishes between right and wrong

28:35.978 --> 28:38.898
I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to escape the crime of ethnic destruction.

28:39.278 --> 28:41.268
Now the Immortal King is dead

28:41.278 --> 28:43.858
What will Dai Thuong's fate be?

29:06.188 --> 29:09.978
Heavenly Venerable called us and 12 disciples to Ngoc Hu Palace to set up the Mon Tuong array.

29:10.358 --> 29:12.298
Turns out it's also because of this.

29:12.688 --> 29:14.188
It's also very sad.

29:14.188 --> 29:16.608
Could this be the future of humanity?

29:18.068 --> 29:19.898
This is a God-sent disaster, master.

29:20.478 --> 29:22.648
Why do innocent people have to suffer this disaster?

29:23.228 --> 29:25.018
The human world is constantly at war.

29:25.028 --> 29:26.398
Youkai appear

29:26.898 --> 29:29.608
It is difficult to avoid this disaster.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.018
Before

29:31.478 --> 29:33.518
Pangu created chaos

29:33.858 --> 29:35.688
The clear air ascends to Heaven

29:35.688 --> 29:37.568
The turbidity of the lower world creates Earth

29:37.898 --> 29:39.438
Heaven and earth take shape.

29:39.438 --> 29:41.148
All things multiply.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.938
When great disaster strikes

29:43.938 --> 29:45.608
went against the rules

29:46.228 --> 29:48.648
The world returns to chaos

29:48.978 --> 29:50.648
There won't be any living beings left

29:51.228 --> 29:54.228
Even though people bring disaster upon themselves

29:54.328 --> 29:57.798
we cannot help but save.

29:58.438 --> 30:00.398
Lady Nu Wa has returned to Bang Phong

30:00.398 --> 30:01.858
Entrust our Kunlun sect to protect.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.938
I also predicted that this day would come.

30:05.818 --> 30:09.648
Looks like it's time to take Bang Phong down the mountain.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.608
Just bring the Divine Wind Table to the human world

30:12.608 --> 30:14.188
entrusted to the ruler of the world

30:14.188 --> 30:16.608
To completely open the Divine Spirit Table

30:16.608 --> 30:18.648
Only then can God's disasters be eliminated

30:18.648 --> 30:20.438
save sentient beings.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.858
The price you have to pay when bringing the board down the mountain

30:22.858 --> 30:25.148
Surely the Brothers also understand clearly.

30:25.888 --> 30:28.198
Master and disciple agreed.

30:28.438 --> 30:30.018
Let me go this time.

30:30.568 --> 30:31.898
You should still let me go.

30:32.228 --> 30:33.438
Should have let me go.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.728
This cannot go wrong

30:37.188 --> 30:39.188
Definitely let the right person go.

30:39.428 --> 30:41.228
Or just let Master decide.

31:20.218 --> 31:21.398
Humanity has tribulation

31:21.468 --> 31:23.458
The disciple vows to bring the god Bang Phong down the mountain.

31:24.768 --> 31:26.058
Tu Nha.

31:26.538 --> 31:27.818
do you know?

31:28.188 --> 31:31.228
Cultivate immortality once touching the Divine Spirit Table

31:31.228 --> 31:32.898
will lose all magic power

31:32.898 --> 31:34.268
Turn into an ordinary person

31:34.658 --> 31:37.898
Will never return to Kunlun again.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.238
So we have to go.

31:42.858 --> 31:47.248
Why tell me why?

31:47.398 --> 31:50.398
The monks have been cultivating here for more than a thousand years

31:50.418 --> 31:52.188
It's only today that I'm virtuous

31:52.728 --> 31:54.688
absolute change cannot be destroyed.

31:55.108 --> 31:57.188
The disciple has only been cultivating immortality for about 40 years

31:57.188 --> 31:58.358
little magic power

31:58.358 --> 32:00.028
Losing it is not a pity.

32:00.318 --> 32:01.948
and before we practice immortality

32:01.978 --> 32:03.318
was already a businessman

32:03.318 --> 32:04.568
Went everywhere

32:04.568 --> 32:06.518
Very knowledgeable in dealing with people.

32:08.068 --> 32:09.228
Disciple is incompetent

32:09.648 --> 32:11.018
willing to shoulder this responsibility.

32:11.658 --> 32:14.518
Tu Nha, you haven't been practicing for long

32:14.608 --> 32:15.878
Magic power is still weak

32:16.278 --> 32:18.188
It is difficult to understand God's will

32:18.278 --> 32:20.648
That's why I didn't call you here.

32:20.848 --> 32:23.658
You have compassion for humanity

32:23.758 --> 32:25.308
but rushed in voluntarily

32:25.388 --> 32:27.638
Even arguing against God's will

32:28.828 --> 32:33.378
Could this be God's secret arrangement?

33:09.228 --> 33:10.398
Khuong Tu Nha.

33:11.028 --> 33:12.648
You really want to give up

33:12.648 --> 33:15.358
Magic power and longevity have been cultivated for the past 40 years

33:15.808 --> 33:18.208
to go back to being a normal person?

34:05.688 --> 34:13.268
[THE MYSTERIOUS MATE OF HEAVEN]

34:13.358 --> 34:20.438
[HA Sinh THUONG]

34:21.688 --> 34:23.768
The ancestors are above

34:23.777 --> 34:27.648
An Tho's son never intended to be called King

34:27.648 --> 34:30.978
But the country cannot one day be without a master

34:30.978 --> 34:34.268
He is the only remaining son of the Immortal King

34:34.277 --> 34:36.228
Don't dare not mention the throne

34:36.228 --> 34:38.648
Wishing to maintain the bloodline of Dai Thuong.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.818
Uncle Phien Vuong

34:40.908 --> 34:43.658
Ask about the nation's fate.

35:50.728 --> 35:55.238
Heaven has destroyed Dai Thuong.

35:57.778 --> 36:00.018
Heaven destroys Great Thuong.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.828
Heaven destroys Great Thuong.

36:15.378 --> 36:17.198
Why did Uncle Vuong say that?

36:17.358 --> 36:19.518
I asked Heaven about Dai Thuong's fate

36:19.528 --> 36:22.768
God's will is clear, my turtle's shell is also broken.

36:22.878 --> 36:24.618
What crime did Dai Thuong commit against God?

36:25.108 --> 36:26.518
Dai Thuong royal family

36:26.528 --> 36:29.688
The son replaces the father, the people replace the King.

36:29.688 --> 36:33.438
This great crime is greater than the previous twenty dynasties.

36:33.558 --> 36:37.168
So the Jade Emperor was angry.

36:37.648 --> 36:39.318
We are descendants of the Thuong family

36:39.318 --> 36:42.518
I don't deserve to rule this world anymore.

36:42.938 --> 36:45.218
This king offered a hundred people to worship heaven

36:45.308 --> 36:46.878
To appease anger.

36:47.068 --> 36:48.488
Gay.

36:48.488 --> 36:49.648
Thousands more people.

36:49.648 --> 36:53.398
Even if there were ten thousand people, it would be useless.

36:53.728 --> 36:54.788
In the past

36:54.948 --> 36:59.298
The ancestors wanted to unify the world

36:59.368 --> 37:02.978
Too much punishment makes God angry

37:03.288 --> 37:07.088
The world suffered a 7-year drought.

37:07.188 --> 37:09.978
Plants cannot grow.

37:10.598 --> 37:15.258
Thuong King's ancestors set up an altar to worship Heaven

37:15.318 --> 37:16.648
Blame yourself

37:16.648 --> 37:21.568
I was also moved by the Jade Emperor who sent down rain.

37:21.568 --> 37:25.788
Could it be that Uncle Vuong wants us to follow our ancestors?

37:25.998 --> 37:27.868
What does Uncle Thu mean?

37:34.908 --> 37:36.878
His father had just ascended the throne

37:36.918 --> 37:38.798
He wanted to force my father to take the blame himself

37:39.108 --> 37:41.148
Great disobedience is no different than treason.

37:41.148 --> 37:41.898
Worth dying for.

37:41.938 --> 37:43.188
Arrogant.

37:43.188 --> 37:45.398
The disaster has just begun

37:45.818 --> 37:47.188
soon

37:47.188 --> 37:49.608
The people will be engulfed in a sea of ​​fire

37:49.608 --> 37:51.228
The ancestors also no longer have strong blood

37:51.228 --> 37:52.188
It's time to measure

37:52.188 --> 37:55.648
Dai Thuong is no longer there, so what the hell is the need for the king?

37:57.898 --> 37:59.768
Father, please pass the throne to me

37:59.818 --> 38:01.528
I vow to take the blame myself for my father.

38:07.418 --> 38:09.118
What is a King?

38:10.028 --> 38:13.658
The sins of the world must be borne by the king

38:15.898 --> 38:18.858
I will follow Thuong's ancestors

38:19.858 --> 38:22.318
built an altar to worship Heaven in Trieu Ca

38:23.568 --> 38:25.218
Finish day

38:25.518 --> 38:30.458
This King will bear his sins against Heaven for Dai Thuong's sake.

38:33.408 --> 38:37.098
Congratulations Dai Thuong.

39:04.628 --> 39:06.988
The villain has been waiting at Luc Dai for half an hour

39:07.148 --> 39:08.228
Lord

39:09.158 --> 39:10.988
Still can't see it.

39:16.148 --> 39:17.398
Let me go invite my father.

39:19.038 --> 39:21.538
Today I said things I shouldn't have said

39:23.278 --> 39:24.978
Father is still doubting you.

39:25.628 --> 39:27.798
I told my father to pass the throne to me

39:28.028 --> 39:29.978
is truly willing to die for him

39:30.238 --> 39:31.818
Could it be that he doesn't understand?

39:34.938 --> 39:37.778
I don't understand my father.

39:38.108 --> 39:38.898
Mom.

39:40.858 --> 39:42.018
Mom has thought a lot.

39:43.188 --> 39:44.818
I will definitely invite my father to come

39:45.338 --> 39:47.028
My whole family reunited.

41:03.108 --> 41:04.048
Co Phat.

41:04.188 --> 41:04.858
An Giao.

41:05.478 --> 41:06.268
There is a lovely lake.

41:06.278 --> 41:07.608
Quickly follow.

41:19.168 --> 41:21.268
Are you sure it came in here?

41:24.778 --> 41:27.628
Over there, in Extraction Pavilion.

41:37.858 --> 41:39.418
The king is resting

41:39.468 --> 41:41.118
If you have not been instructed, do not rush in arbitrarily.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.508
The king is in danger

41:43.738 --> 41:45.178
What's the point of managing so much?

42:17.398 --> 42:18.148
Who?

42:19.898 --> 42:20.728
father.

42:21.188 --> 42:22.228
It's me.

42:22.528 --> 42:24.818
Late at night, he grabbed his sword and rushed in

42:25.868 --> 42:27.468
Want to steal my throne.

42:27.618 --> 42:29.298
You're too hasty.

42:29.338 --> 42:30.458
I don't dare.

42:30.508 --> 42:32.178
The goddess is chasing a demon fox.

42:33.498 --> 42:34.728
Demon.

42:34.898 --> 42:36.428
We only care about your Majesty's safety.

42:36.518 --> 42:38.828
That's why I boldly rushed in and asked the king's forgiveness.

42:38.978 --> 42:40.108
Where is Ho Yeu?

42:40.898 --> 42:42.578
Why is she here?

42:43.128 --> 42:44.218
Get out now.

42:44.868 --> 42:45.868
Yes, my king.

42:54.528 --> 42:56.998
I should have killed that To Dat Ky.

42:57.888 --> 43:00.118
The great king also sacrificed himself for the sake of the world

43:00.168 --> 43:01.478
Also a great hero.

43:05.418 --> 43:07.768
Don't make him angry anymore.

43:11.018 --> 43:12.818
If it were your father,

43:13.248 --> 43:14.898
Can you still say that?

43:22.938 --> 43:24.398
I've been away from home for 8 years

43:25.648 --> 43:27.108
Father

43:28.088 --> 43:30.888
Maybe you don't recognize me anymore.

43:52.528 --> 43:55.378
This year is probably a year of poor harvest

43:57.978 --> 44:00.888
Trieu Ca had a natural disaster

44:00.948 --> 44:05.178
It seems that it is difficult for us in Tay Ky to avoid this disaster.

44:05.898 --> 44:07.888
Parents look far ahead

44:07.988 --> 44:09.838
food of the West

44:09.918 --> 44:11.738
Can last 3 years.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.688
What happens after 3 years?

44:26.028 --> 44:27.458
After just one night

44:27.778 --> 44:30.398
All the princes of the first king

44:30.398 --> 44:32.298
all died unjustly.

44:32.518 --> 44:35.518
New King Vuong Rush ascended the throne

44:35.978 --> 44:39.068
Moreover, he also ordered the four great lords to immediately enter Trieu Dien Kien

44:39.068 --> 44:40.938
Think again and again

44:41.148 --> 44:42.618
next time to Trieu Ca

44:42.688 --> 44:44.438
Good and evil are unpredictable.

44:44.688 --> 44:46.378
Please think again carefully

44:47.108 --> 44:47.938
Lord

44:49.268 --> 44:53.168
Disobeying the king's orders makes it difficult to avoid war.

44:53.428 --> 44:57.418
Benefits us but harms the world.

45:00.298 --> 45:03.608
Although the king changed hands

45:04.308 --> 45:07.968
I cannot give up.

45:11.948 --> 45:15.518
Just went to see Co Phat

45:16.448 --> 45:18.568
Haven't seen each other for 8 years.

45:18.668 --> 45:21.328
He's probably as tall as you.

45:23.438 --> 45:25.108
He's probably taller than me.

45:31.648 --> 45:35.318
I'm gone, this Tay Ky is yours to own

45:35.648 --> 45:37.638
be responsible

45:37.858 --> 45:39.648
no matter what happens

45:40.518 --> 45:43.848
You are also not allowed to leave Tay Ky.

45:46.518 --> 45:49.258
Father left and soon returned.

46:19.438 --> 46:20.478
Don't get mixed up anymore.

46:22.778 --> 46:23.398
Don't mix.

46:25.358 --> 46:26.858
If you don't have a card, you can't enter.

46:26.978 --> 46:27.768
Don't jostle behind anymore.

46:27.778 --> 46:29.068
If you don't have a card, you can't enter

46:29.728 --> 46:31.148
Do you still need tea?

46:31.898 --> 46:33.018
It's so complicated.

46:33.028 --> 46:33.728
Uncle.

46:33.728 --> 46:35.568
Let me use the Wind Fire Wheel to fly you over there.

46:35.648 --> 46:38.898
Let me use the Five Elements Technique faster.

46:38.898 --> 46:41.568
When going down the mountain, Master had already given instructions

46:41.568 --> 46:43.568
Do not abuse magic.

46:45.608 --> 46:48.148
But in the human world, there will be human ways

46:49.568 --> 46:50.868
Look at me here.

46:55.018 --> 46:57.698
Sir, it's been hard.

46:57.938 --> 46:58.978
Who are you?

47:00.568 --> 47:05.188
We are disciples of immortals living in Kunlun from afar

47:05.188 --> 47:07.938
So we don't have any cards.

47:07.938 --> 47:08.898
Don't have a card?

47:08.898 --> 47:09.688
Do not have.

47:11.958 --> 47:14.178
But we have this.

47:19.018 --> 47:20.158
Take the lever.

47:23.888 --> 47:25.398
What is this?

47:26.298 --> 47:27.888
That fairy pill.

47:28.828 --> 47:29.618
Does it have any effect?

47:29.658 --> 47:30.858
What effect?

47:31.188 --> 47:34.858
The pill contains immortal energy

47:34.858 --> 47:36.398
has both yin and yang essence

47:36.398 --> 47:38.148
refined according to God's will

47:38.148 --> 47:43.188
Including the harmony of heaven and earth, you get 1 pill

47:43.188 --> 47:44.358
Smell the thing.

47:44.698 --> 47:45.818
Calm, alert.

47:45.818 --> 47:46.978
Smell the thing.

47:47.038 --> 47:48.868
Can cure all diseases.

47:50.648 --> 47:53.478
That's exactly how it is, such precious immortal pills

47:54.068 --> 47:56.768
No matter how much money you spend, you won't buy a crib.

47:57.108 --> 47:58.478
This is fate

47:58.608 --> 47:59.608
give it to you.

48:02.438 --> 48:05.228
Uncle, your method is indeed effective

48:05.228 --> 48:06.898
Come on, come on, come on.

48:06.898 --> 48:08.438
Let me receive you thoughtfully.

48:08.438 --> 48:09.188
Do not formal.

48:09.188 --> 48:11.318
Let me personally take you into the city.

48:13.228 --> 48:15.438
Want to eliminate disasters

48:16.478 --> 48:19.478
Does the king have to personally go to Tru Thien Dai Tru Thien?

48:27.028 --> 48:28.318
Maybe

48:30.398 --> 48:32.648
Only fairies have a way.

48:39.228 --> 48:40.018
Here we go

48:40.108 --> 48:40.978
Get off the bus.

48:41.228 --> 48:42.268
Behind followed closely.

48:42.568 --> 48:43.358
Always.

49:08.228 --> 49:08.818
Uncle.

49:55.258 --> 49:57.708
Uncle, what is this?

50:04.568 --> 50:05.938
We are sold out.

50:05.938 --> 50:06.858
How to sell?

50:06.938 --> 50:09.858
Doesn't Master Master understand the human world very well?

50:11.558 --> 50:13.438
I haven't been back for more than 40 years

50:13.438 --> 50:15.818
In the past, the human world was not like that.

50:16.218 --> 50:17.818
Quickly lead them away.

50:19.378 --> 50:20.218
Sir.

50:20.278 --> 50:22.568
We came to offer treasure to that great king.

50:22.568 --> 50:24.278
Stop bullshitting.

50:45.818 --> 50:46.768
That's enough.

51:16.978 --> 51:19.108
Heart thunder palm.

51:20.528 --> 51:21.858
Still not quick to save people?

51:22.028 --> 51:23.108
Can you use magic?

51:23.108 --> 51:23.988
Talkative.

51:24.728 --> 51:26.148
You pissed me off.

52:10.578 --> 52:12.738
Turns out fairies are real

52:13.438 --> 52:14.568
Your Majesty has been saved.

52:18.608 --> 52:22.508
Kim Hinh Island Taoist of Dong Hai, Than Cong Bao

52:22.538 --> 52:25.598
Performing magic for the king to see.

52:45.858 --> 52:47.648
The show is done.

52:53.398 --> 52:54.268
Very good.

52:54.788 --> 52:56.108
What magic is this?

52:56.278 --> 52:57.318
Great King

52:57.418 --> 53:00.588
This is a technique of beheading without death

53:01.018 --> 53:02.938
What if you burn yourself to death?

53:04.648 --> 53:06.768
Even if you cut off your head, you cannot die

53:07.358 --> 53:10.398
What's so scary about being burned to death?

53:11.068 --> 53:13.768
Or, how long does it take to learn?

53:14.228 --> 53:18.268
It takes thousands of years for a petty person to practice

53:18.488 --> 53:21.708
However, the king was born talented

53:21.778 --> 53:25.278
It only takes 500 years.

53:26.318 --> 53:27.358
500 years?

53:27.478 --> 53:28.518
Correct.

53:30.068 --> 53:30.898
Ridiculous.

53:30.898 --> 53:31.938
Pain, pain.

53:35.348 --> 53:36.008
Don't, don't.

53:36.108 --> 53:36.818
Do not.

53:39.358 --> 53:40.398
This side, this side.

53:40.398 --> 53:42.318
This side.

53:42.318 --> 53:43.228
Hurry up.

53:44.618 --> 53:47.658
Kunlun mountain Taoist, Khuong Tu Nha

53:47.718 --> 53:50.398
Come offer treasure.

53:58.488 --> 53:59.958
What treasure?

54:00.088 --> 54:01.688
The treasure we offer

54:02.138 --> 54:04.808
It is the "Deity Table"

54:07.788 --> 54:10.008
What effect does this treasure have?

54:10.048 --> 54:12.538
The world is in trouble

54:12.638 --> 54:17.498
I obey Master, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, to bring treasures down the mountain

54:17.698 --> 54:20.738
Searching for the ruler of the world.

54:21.518 --> 54:25.718
The ruler of the world opened the Deity Conferment Table

54:25.748 --> 54:29.298
Once declared, natural disasters will disappear

54:29.358 --> 54:32.568
can help sentient beings avoid disasters.

54:34.178 --> 54:36.358
Just this little board

54:36.418 --> 54:38.068
Is it possible to interpret God's will?

54:38.068 --> 54:40.378
Can control God's will.

54:48.178 --> 54:52.628
The deification board is a treasure left by Lady Nu Wa

54:52.718 --> 54:57.088
Can absorb evil energy all over the world

54:57.518 --> 55:01.988
is also the soul of the deceased

55:02.048 --> 55:05.338
Once the king opens the Deity Table

55:05.398 --> 55:08.518
These resentments will belong to the king

55:08.618 --> 55:12.378
Let the king control at will.

55:12.878 --> 55:14.278
Say so

55:14.438 --> 55:16.188
more people die

55:16.328 --> 55:18.298
The magic power of the God Conferment Table is stronger?

55:18.338 --> 55:20.858
wise king.

55:20.978 --> 55:24.288
It seems that natural disasters are not a bad thing.

55:24.368 --> 55:26.408
great king.

55:27.248 --> 55:29.098
That's a demon.

55:29.178 --> 55:30.038
Always.

55:30.188 --> 55:31.728
Reward generously.

55:31.798 --> 55:32.998
Wait.

55:33.938 --> 55:36.068
This deity table

55:37.998 --> 55:40.728
is it real or fake

55:42.748 --> 55:45.578
Still don't know?

55:45.698 --> 55:47.338
How to check the actual price?

55:47.398 --> 55:51.088
If someone dies

55:51.978 --> 55:54.438
Small people must find a way.

56:05.858 --> 56:08.768
Donate a soul amulet.

56:42.558 --> 56:46.548
mighty king

56:46.858 --> 56:50.118
Unfortunately, the king does not understand

56:50.398 --> 56:54.318
To open this Seal Table, you must coordinate step by step with the ancestors

56:54.648 --> 56:56.768
Let me show you

56:56.818 --> 56:58.808
Watch carefully.

57:17.358 --> 57:18.818
This is...

57:25.898 --> 57:27.938
Maybe...

57:28.448 --> 57:31.768
Great Dharma set cang.

57:32.978 --> 57:35.018
Fellow monks, please stop.

57:35.068 --> 57:36.108
Quick, run away.

57:36.228 --> 57:37.268
Catch them.

57:47.148 --> 57:48.398
Don't harm innocent people.

57:48.398 --> 57:49.318
Know.

58:16.438 --> 58:17.358
Be gentle, be gentle.

58:31.148 --> 58:32.478
Uncle.

58:46.838 --> 58:50.068
An Giao, Co Phat, quickly take back Bang Bang.

58:53.678 --> 58:54.818
Always.

58:55.278 --> 58:56.398
Stay away.

58:58.688 --> 58:59.818
Chase.

59:27.818 --> 59:28.728
Water release.

59:55.588 --> 59:57.588
Co Phat, please go over there.

01:00:29.608 --> 01:00:31.938
It's dangerous, don't chase anymore.

01:00:34.568 --> 01:00:35.438
Don't run anymore.

01:00:36.188 --> 01:00:37.268
The road ahead is dead.

01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:38.318
Do you still want to follow?

01:00:38.728 --> 01:00:40.018
If you chase me any longer, I'll jump down.

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:41.518
Just hand over the Deity Tablet

01:00:41.978 --> 01:00:42.978
Why suddenly change your mind?

01:00:43.028 --> 01:00:45.158
Just pretend I never came

01:00:45.228 --> 01:00:46.938
Then nothing happens anymore, right?

01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:48.858
Go home quickly.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:51.478
The deity list belongs to the ruler of the world

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.938
is also my father.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.608
On what basis do you refuse to give it?

01:00:54.608 --> 01:00:56.358
I was going to give it to him too

01:00:56.418 --> 01:00:58.358
But we really can't.

01:00:58.358 --> 01:00:59.228
Still making excuses.

01:01:03.778 --> 01:01:04.688
So I ask you

01:01:05.108 --> 01:01:07.108
Who is the ruler of the world?

01:01:07.818 --> 01:01:09.268
Arbitrarily killing innocent people

01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:11.068
Right on the main hall like that

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:14.228
Then we will treat everyone else in the world the same way.

01:01:14.978 --> 01:01:15.768
My father is also for the people

01:01:15.778 --> 01:01:17.308
Disaster is here.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:21.148
Every day countless people die unjustly

01:01:21.358 --> 01:01:24.688
He also said that natural disasters are not a bad thing

01:01:24.688 --> 01:01:25.478
I ask you

01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:27.228
If one day you become king

01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:28.358
Do you do the same?

01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:29.188
He shut his mouth.

01:01:30.528 --> 01:01:32.478
Quickly return the Deification Table to my father.

01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:09.318
Old man, hand over the Deity Tablet to me.

01:02:09.978 --> 01:02:12.228
Otherwise, it will be difficult for the king to keep his life.

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.318
If delivered completely

01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:18.148
Maybe everyone in the world will be lost.

01:02:18.688 --> 01:02:19.608
He said nonsense.

01:02:20.398 --> 01:02:21.648
The king is a hero

01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:24.298
But I guess you guys are just idiots.

01:02:26.658 --> 01:02:29.188
Surely I don't care about the life and death of the world

01:02:29.688 --> 01:02:31.818
He only cares about himself.

01:02:32.438 --> 01:02:33.358
An Giao.

01:02:37.098 --> 01:02:37.918
An Giao.

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:39.268
He just saved you.

01:02:39.318 --> 01:02:40.148
I don't care.

01:02:40.448 --> 01:02:42.378
We must save our father.

01:03:02.598 --> 01:03:04.368
Don't harm him.

01:03:16.838 --> 01:03:18.188
Where is my deification board?

01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:19.688
You guys let him go.

01:03:23.978 --> 01:03:24.648
Co Phat.

01:03:24.648 --> 01:03:25.898
Hurry up and take the Deity Tablet now.

01:03:25.898 --> 01:03:27.318
Don't make a mess, don't make a mess.

01:03:27.858 --> 01:03:29.188
Can you try throwing it at me?

01:03:29.188 --> 01:03:30.228
Don't throw.

01:03:31.088 --> 01:03:32.778
No, it's absolutely impossible to change.

01:03:36.318 --> 01:03:37.518
Did he really do it?

01:03:38.278 --> 01:03:39.818
Heart thunder palm.

01:03:45.728 --> 01:03:47.108
Does uncle really dance too?

01:04:03.528 --> 01:04:04.188
An Giao.

01:05:05.358 --> 01:05:06.898
Master.

01:05:07.728 --> 01:05:09.768
The disciple has an urgent matter to report.

01:05:10.278 --> 01:05:11.398
Roster

01:05:11.818 --> 01:05:14.728
The disciple has found it.

01:05:15.438 --> 01:05:18.518
If found already

01:05:18.528 --> 01:05:21.188
Why don't you bring it to me?

01:05:21.688 --> 01:05:23.858
Master forgive me

01:05:25.348 --> 01:05:26.978
not an incompetent disciple

01:05:27.778 --> 01:05:31.358
It's just that the Kunlun demon crowd is strong

01:05:32.188 --> 01:05:33.268
fourth...

01:05:34.188 --> 01:05:36.068
Who are the Kunlun demons?

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:40.068
Dare to bully senior brother?

01:05:40.358 --> 01:05:43.488
Master, let's teach them a lesson.

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:50.228
This is a strange soul talisman.

01:05:51.568 --> 01:05:52.938
Master has helped you

01:05:53.938 --> 01:05:55.318
Don't go yet.

01:05:55.938 --> 01:05:57.318
Thank you so much, master.

01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:28.938
Uncle.

01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:31.688
The monk is awake.

01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:33.898
An Tho is the ruler of the world

01:06:34.028 --> 01:06:36.228
Why doesn't your uncle just hand over the Confession Board to you?

01:06:36.478 --> 01:06:38.438
What does it mean for us to stay in this human world?

01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:40.858
Yes, this time we go down the mountain

01:06:40.858 --> 01:06:42.188
nothing good at all.

01:06:42.188 --> 01:06:44.148
The uncle almost died

01:06:45.728 --> 01:06:47.568
Or we should just hand over Bang and then Ve Kun Luan.

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.858
Just let those mortals die on their own.

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:54.898
An Giao is the crown prince

01:06:54.898 --> 01:06:57.688
The next successor to the monarchy of the world is me.

01:07:00.778 --> 01:07:03.018
He is completely different from his father

01:07:03.028 --> 01:07:05.688
An Giao, you must be the ruler of the world

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.478
So when should we wait?

01:07:11.038 --> 01:07:13.058
Who said we have to wait?

01:07:17.608 --> 01:07:20.648
Could it be that a demon has descended to earth?

01:07:32.568 --> 01:07:33.688
Stop.

01:07:51.778 --> 01:07:54.818
In the deserted mountains, where did this child come from?

01:07:57.078 --> 01:07:59.358
Strange appearance, definitely a monster.

01:08:01.768 --> 01:08:04.208
My lord, be careful.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:36.648
You have no father or mother, you are truly pitiful.

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:48.858
Bees rush.

01:08:49.938 --> 01:08:52.148
That thing you're holding is likely a demon.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.858
Just kill it now.

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.938
To avoid becoming a disaster later.

01:09:02.068 --> 01:09:04.358
If you don't dare to act, leave it to us.

01:09:04.528 --> 01:09:06.408
It's just a child

01:09:08.358 --> 01:09:10.417
even if it's a monster

01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:14.408
good or evil future

01:09:14.468 --> 01:09:18.358
You also have to see how it educates

01:09:18.537 --> 01:09:21.058
How can you rush to conclusions?

01:09:21.108 --> 01:09:23.478
Mr. Sinh said the right thing

01:09:23.978 --> 01:09:26.518
Don't act without thinking

01:09:27.618 --> 01:09:32.768
Under Khuong Tu Nha, we are all Taoist monks of Kun Luan

01:09:33.758 --> 01:09:36.537
In lower Co Xuong Tay Ky

01:09:37.978 --> 01:09:41.087
Marquis of the West, long time no see.

01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:50.138
This baby is so weak

01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:51.988
Let Vi save his life

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:55.438
Or send it to Kunlun Mountain

01:09:55.438 --> 01:09:59.438
Let my master, Primordial Heavenly Venerable, personally teach me, okay?

01:10:01.418 --> 01:10:04.818
I've heard the name Primordial Heavenly Venerable for a long time

01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:10.108
Being able to worship his master for initiation is truly this child's blessing

01:10:11.318 --> 01:10:14.598
So please, Marquis Tay Ba, name this child

01:10:14.748 --> 01:10:16.938
For convenience, it will be easier to recognize each other later.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:23.948
Born on the day of a thunderstorm

01:10:24.778 --> 01:10:28.198
So let's name it Loi Chan Tu.

01:10:29.398 --> 01:10:33.358
Duong Tien, Na Tra, quickly take Loi Tran Tu to Kun Luan mountain

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:34.268
Yes.

01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:48.568
Recently, natural disasters and strange phenomena have appeared continuously.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:53.898
Don't you know that Marquis of the West came to Trieu Ca because of this?

01:10:54.028 --> 01:10:55.478
The new king is crowned

01:10:55.478 --> 01:10:59.728
The vassals from all directions must come and pay their respects

01:10:59.728 --> 01:11:01.838
It's also a courtesy to the lord.

01:11:01.908 --> 01:11:04.638
So the other three lords are also on their way?

01:11:04.638 --> 01:11:05.548
Ùm.

01:11:11.228 --> 01:11:14.648
You asked Tay Ba Marquis Co Xuong to summon us four great hawks

01:11:14.648 --> 01:11:18.768
Also because they want to depose An Tho and make An Giao king?

01:11:19.228 --> 01:11:20.108
That's right.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.998
An Tho has promised

01:11:22.148 --> 01:11:24.608
I will personally accept my sins against God.

01:11:24.608 --> 01:11:25.568
Lake map.

01:11:26.438 --> 01:11:28.358
Do you think he will take the blame himself?

01:11:29.108 --> 01:11:30.728
After Tru Thien Dai completed construction

01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:33.318
It will be clear immediately whether what he says is true or false.

01:11:33.318 --> 01:11:33.688
What do you mean?

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:35.898
I can't wait anymore.

01:11:36.278 --> 01:11:39.688
Natural disasters have struck everywhere

01:11:39.688 --> 01:11:43.358
In the North, epidemics raged.

01:11:43.388 --> 01:11:46.678
In the East, the well is contaminated and cannot be used anymore.

01:11:46.898 --> 01:11:50.978
In the South, children die as soon as they are born.

01:11:51.398 --> 01:11:54.728
In the West, ripe rice has no seeds.

01:11:55.148 --> 01:11:58.518
If we wait any longer, more people will die.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.648
This natural disaster was caused by the An family

01:12:01.728 --> 01:12:03.568
So it must have been decided by the An family.

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:06.398
Thuong Vuong is the ruler of the world,

01:12:06.398 --> 01:12:07.518
This world is all his.

01:12:07.528 --> 01:12:08.268
Heaven

01:12:09.018 --> 01:12:11.518
It's not just King Thuong's,

01:12:11.648 --> 01:12:14.188
It belongs to the people of the world.

01:12:14.198 --> 01:12:15.668
You then.

01:12:17.578 --> 01:12:19.978
Exactly.

01:12:20.908 --> 01:12:25.658
The Marquis of the West is proficient in trigrams and has never told a wrong fortune.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.358
What does the fortune teller say?

01:12:27.648 --> 01:12:30.978
This hexagram predicts Hopelessness

01:12:31.528 --> 01:12:35.358
The Army's work is not inherently righteous.

01:12:35.858 --> 01:12:39.858
Luc Nhi's position does not plow but still harvests

01:12:40.478 --> 01:12:43.108
Thence inferred

01:12:44.298 --> 01:12:51.398
The soldier may not be An Tho but someone else.

01:12:52.528 --> 01:12:54.018
So who will it be?

01:12:54.028 --> 01:12:57.768
Besides An Tho, who else can?

01:12:57.778 --> 01:13:00.728
This important issue cannot be discussed indiscriminately.

01:13:04.878 --> 01:13:07.288
Sir, betray or not?

01:13:07.338 --> 01:13:08.968
Counter?

01:13:17.748 --> 01:13:20.418
Co Xuong, how about you?

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:27.648
Don't forget our son is still a hostage in Trieu Ca.

01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:33.068
Okay.

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:35.868
Okay.

01:13:36.018 --> 01:13:38.268
We will return to Nam Do to start an army

01:13:38.338 --> 01:13:41.688
Without you, I would have rebelled.

01:13:43.068 --> 01:13:44.438
Stop.

01:13:48.668 --> 01:13:51.818
You guys dare to gather here and plot a rebellion.

01:13:52.278 --> 01:13:54.938
It's only him, kill him.

01:13:54.938 --> 01:13:56.978
Absolutely not.

01:13:59.128 --> 01:14:02.278
That's my son, Co Phat.

01:14:05.068 --> 01:14:07.648
I am Co Phat, royal guard of King Thuong

01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:11.818
With my own eyes I saw An Khai kill his father.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.048
Father took advantage of fortune telling to kill the king

01:14:15.108 --> 01:14:16.648
What's the intention?

01:14:17.188 --> 01:14:18.518
Have you seen it clearly yet?

01:14:18.618 --> 01:14:20.618
Been a hostage for too long

01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:23.308
My mentality has also changed completely.

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:25.818
What else do you need for a boy like that?

01:14:25.898 --> 01:14:27.438
Kill him.

01:14:37.498 --> 01:14:39.688
Don't try to escape.

01:14:44.538 --> 01:14:46.108
- Co Phat, I finally found you. - We are brothers.

01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:48.318
We are King Thuong's guards, quickly put down our weapons.

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:49.728
Stay away.

01:14:57.218 --> 01:14:59.068
I heard you have a talent for divination.

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:00.608
Skeletal Muscle.

01:15:01.758 --> 01:15:03.568
Can you predict how you will die?

01:15:04.298 --> 01:15:05.998
Have you figured it out yet?

01:15:07.168 --> 01:15:09.658
Lord

01:15:10.188 --> 01:15:11.648
fortune teller

01:15:12.048 --> 01:15:14.298
above can tell the sky

01:15:14.298 --> 01:15:16.588
Below you can tell the land

01:15:16.938 --> 01:15:18.218
Merely

01:15:18.858 --> 01:15:20.898
Do not tell your own fortune.

01:15:21.028 --> 01:15:22.608
So what have you guessed?

01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:25.688
According to fortune telling

01:15:26.758 --> 01:15:28.618
Your Majesty

01:15:29.028 --> 01:15:33.208
you will die at the hands of your loved ones.

01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:44.108
Everyone in the world knows

01:15:44.538 --> 01:15:46.608
This king vows for everyone in the world

01:15:46.698 --> 01:15:48.688
will be guilty before God.

01:15:48.688 --> 01:15:49.888
Musculoskeletal,

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.238
You scammers.

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:56.688
Quickly stand before your father.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.518
When An Khai murdered his father

01:16:06.718 --> 01:16:09.078
Your children are all present

01:16:09.188 --> 01:16:11.028
Also saw it with my own eyes

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.248
your people

01:16:13.308 --> 01:16:15.798
Don't believe the truth but see it with your own eyes

01:16:15.848 --> 01:16:18.358
but believe in one-sided rumors

01:16:19.438 --> 01:16:20.898
You are not stupid

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:24.078
You are planning to rebel.

01:16:28.328 --> 01:16:31.628
Take a close look at these traitors

01:16:33.218 --> 01:16:35.298
could have been your father

01:16:36.478 --> 01:16:37.188
Now

01:16:37.978 --> 01:16:40.948
They were traitors to the Shang Dynasty.

01:16:40.978 --> 01:16:42.438
My sister married you

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.818
Now she is also the Queen.

01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:47.148
Crown Prince An Giao is also my grandson.

01:16:47.818 --> 01:16:49.738
How can we plot treason?

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:52.858
The blue sky bears witness

01:16:52.918 --> 01:16:55.178
I have no intention of causing rebellion.

01:16:55.688 --> 01:16:56.978
An Tho

01:16:59.258 --> 01:17:00.858
You killed your father, brother Sat.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.188
makes God angry

01:17:02.188 --> 01:17:03.178
You

01:17:03.898 --> 01:17:07.068
is the sinner of the world.

01:17:09.948 --> 01:17:11.718
Your father

01:17:11.758 --> 01:17:14.728
leaving only my dearest child by my side

01:17:15.778 --> 01:17:17.978
to eat and clothe happily

01:17:19.278 --> 01:17:20.858
Wait until later

01:17:20.858 --> 01:17:22.518
mention the title.

01:17:24.318 --> 01:17:25.648
Abandon you

01:17:26.028 --> 01:17:29.228
pushed to Trieu Ca thousands of miles away

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.228
regardless of life or death.

01:17:34.318 --> 01:17:35.148
Now

01:17:36.798 --> 01:17:38.318
you are grown up

01:17:39.498 --> 01:17:42.848
You are Shang Dynasty warriors whom I personally trained

01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:46.148
You are iron warriors

01:17:46.398 --> 01:17:49.648
lived and died together on the battlefield

01:17:51.438 --> 01:17:53.478
No one can control you anymore

01:17:55.528 --> 01:17:59.068
You guys are braver than your brothers back home

01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:03.398
You are more worthy of inheriting the title than your fathers

01:18:06.108 --> 01:18:09.858
Today, this King will give you the opportunity to reclaim justice.

01:18:11.738 --> 01:18:14.098
Who can kill his father?

01:18:17.658 --> 01:18:19.728
immediately inherited the title.

01:18:26.778 --> 01:18:27.978
Sword.

01:18:50.278 --> 01:18:53.568
Have you forgotten To Toan Hieu in Du Chau city?

01:18:57.528 --> 01:18:58.478
Cha.

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:01.648
You didn't kill your father

01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:05.648
One day my father will kill you.

01:19:36.588 --> 01:19:37.388
Very good.

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:38.398
Sung Ung Biao

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:40.768
Now you are Bac Ba Marquis.

01:19:51.818 --> 01:19:53.898
Go ahead.

01:19:57.038 --> 01:19:58.618
Do not.

01:19:58.678 --> 01:19:59.358
Do not.

01:20:01.778 --> 01:20:03.318
With trai.

01:20:05.578 --> 01:20:07.098
My son.

01:20:25.728 --> 01:20:26.858
You must

01:20:27.108 --> 01:20:28.688
Continue living.

01:20:30.528 --> 01:20:31.478
Khuong Van Hoan

01:20:32.358 --> 01:20:34.068
Now you are the Marquis of Dong Ba.

01:20:34.938 --> 01:20:35.768
Cha.

01:21:04.648 --> 01:21:07.098
Want to ask for forgiveness for your father?

01:21:08.908 --> 01:21:09.858
Are not.

01:21:10.678 --> 01:21:12.158
Co Xuong's crime

01:21:12.218 --> 01:21:14.108
Even killing cannot eliminate hatred.

01:21:14.148 --> 01:21:16.568
This time, four great vassals plotted to rebel

01:21:17.018 --> 01:21:19.118
It is because Co Xuong faked the fortune telling

01:21:19.168 --> 01:21:20.808
The mastermind is Co Xuong

01:21:20.858 --> 01:21:22.018
attributed to a felony

01:21:22.258 --> 01:21:23.398
kill him

01:21:23.758 --> 01:21:25.858
It's also covering up his sins

01:21:25.858 --> 01:21:27.688
People in the world will not know the truth.

01:21:31.238 --> 01:21:33.808
We must force him to publicly forgive his crimes

01:21:34.978 --> 01:21:36.688
so that everyone in the world knows

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:39.568
The rebellion plot of the four great hawks failed

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.478
It's because the king acted decisively

01:21:42.728 --> 01:21:44.568
saved the Shang Dynasty.

01:21:51.158 --> 01:21:53.728
You couldn't bring me the Deification Tablet

01:21:54.188 --> 01:21:55.268
guilty.

01:21:56.148 --> 01:21:58.818
You captured four great traitors for the Shang Dynasty

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:00.068
deserve credit for.

01:22:01.478 --> 01:22:02.398
Where are you?

01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:08.348
Escort Co Xuong to prison.

01:22:41.568 --> 01:22:42.478
Cha.

01:22:46.488 --> 01:22:47.408
Cha.

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.938
This piece of jade

01:23:08.898 --> 01:23:13.318
was when I came to Thuong land as a hostage

01:23:13.648 --> 01:23:16.018
I personally put it on for you.

01:23:16.448 --> 01:23:19.318
Do you still remember its meaning?

01:23:20.608 --> 01:23:21.688
Your Majesty has promised me

01:23:22.068 --> 01:23:23.108
Just need someone to admit the error

01:23:23.228 --> 01:23:24.568
I will release you to Tay Ky.

01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.248
"Give back"

01:23:27.778 --> 01:23:30.608
is to return the homeland.

01:23:32.818 --> 01:23:34.818
Summer is coming

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:35.938
Western States

01:23:35.938 --> 01:23:39.068
It's obvious that the person who faked the fortune-telling was inciting treason.

01:23:40.108 --> 01:23:41.518
Why don't you admit guilt?

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.818
I was wrong

01:23:50.478 --> 01:23:51.818
I shouldn't

01:23:53.148 --> 01:23:59.108
You should not bring your child to the side of an evil person like An Tho.

01:23:59.688 --> 01:24:01.318
Father, do you still dare to say that the king is evil?

01:24:03.048 --> 01:24:04.728
I have seen it with my own eyes

01:24:04.728 --> 01:24:06.608
also accompanied him into birth and death

01:24:07.028 --> 01:24:08.358
I've also heard it with my own ears

01:24:08.898 --> 01:24:10.568
Also because I want to pacify the world

01:24:10.818 --> 01:24:12.648
He vowed to sacrifice himself to God to apologize.

01:24:13.818 --> 01:24:14.978
What about father?

01:24:15.608 --> 01:24:16.858
Father is only in Tay Ky

01:24:17.398 --> 01:24:18.768
What do you understand?

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.228
Just based on a few blades of grass, we judge others

01:24:23.688 --> 01:24:25.568
it's ridiculous.

01:24:29.978 --> 01:24:31.358
With trai

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:34.438
Maybe that's just it

01:24:35.358 --> 01:24:40.188
what An Tho wants you to see.

01:24:41.778 --> 01:24:43.438
What I believe in

01:24:44.358 --> 01:24:48.438
That's just what An Tho wants you to believe.

01:24:54.318 --> 01:24:55.438
Cha.

01:25:00.568 --> 01:25:02.018
I remember well

01:25:02.608 --> 01:25:05.478
If you really believe those things

01:25:06.528 --> 01:25:10.858
Yesterday you killed me in the main hall.

01:25:16.898 --> 01:25:18.358
I am your child

01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:21.228
Why would you kill your father?

01:25:27.778 --> 01:25:29.148
Remember carefully

01:25:30.318 --> 01:25:33.818
It doesn't matter whose child you are

01:25:35.228 --> 01:25:39.858
Who you are is the most important thing.

01:26:01.148 --> 01:26:03.518
Such a beautiful body

01:26:05.568 --> 01:26:06.768
Killed

01:26:07.778 --> 01:26:09.568
I don't regret it either.

01:26:12.278 --> 01:26:14.108
Let her start

01:26:15.188 --> 01:26:16.938
You should let her finish.

01:26:21.858 --> 01:26:22.978
Watch out

01:26:24.318 --> 01:26:27.148
I have awakened a fierce beast

01:26:34.608 --> 01:26:35.728
keep me

01:26:38.028 --> 01:26:39.568
I will help the king

01:26:41.478 --> 01:26:46.438
and live forever with me.

01:26:51.978 --> 01:26:54.688
Please, Your Majesty, please grant me permission to die

01:26:57.108 --> 01:26:58.648
What crime is she guilty of?

01:26:59.358 --> 01:27:01.938
The traitor Dong Ba Marquis Khuong Hoan So

01:27:01.938 --> 01:27:03.688
was executed by the king

01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:06.648
I am his sister, I should also be implicated

01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:09.398
She still defends him

01:27:12.438 --> 01:27:14.398
The vassals are loyal officials

01:27:15.278 --> 01:27:17.018
The king killed them

01:27:17.358 --> 01:27:19.358
affects the morality of the king

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.768
Their children are all understanding children

01:27:22.778 --> 01:27:24.648
The great king forced them to kill his father

01:27:24.648 --> 01:27:26.438
contrary to morality and ethics.

01:27:28.108 --> 01:27:29.648
The king was killed

01:27:29.648 --> 01:27:31.768
not just four vassals

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:33.728
The great king has killed all the people in the world

01:27:33.728 --> 01:27:36.358
destroying more than 500 years of business of the Shang Dynasty.

01:27:37.688 --> 01:27:39.068
According to the national flag

01:27:39.728 --> 01:27:41.938
I am the queen

01:27:41.938 --> 01:27:44.518
The king did Wrong, I had to stop him

01:27:44.528 --> 01:27:46.648
According to family law, we are still the main family

01:27:46.648 --> 01:27:49.938
The husband is at fault, he cannot help but say it

01:27:49.938 --> 01:27:51.938
The concubine wished to die to express his will

01:27:51.938 --> 01:27:53.898
I hope your Majesty realizes his mistake.

01:27:54.148 --> 01:27:56.148
People who die cannot come back to life

01:27:58.648 --> 01:28:01.108
Why should you risk your life to bet?

01:28:07.358 --> 01:28:09.518
Such a beautiful body

01:28:10.438 --> 01:28:12.108
It's not easy to get either

01:28:15.478 --> 01:28:17.148
Sister is still the Queen

01:28:19.148 --> 01:28:21.188
should enjoy it more

01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:22.978
human pleasure.

01:28:32.358 --> 01:28:34.318
Why don't we practice together?

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:37.898
Enjoy this joy forever.

01:29:42.218 --> 01:29:44.768
No wonder the king favored her so much

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.398
Even I see you

01:29:50.358 --> 01:29:53.018
can't help but be moved.

01:30:00.148 --> 01:30:03.188
Unexpectedly, Ky Chau land is cold

01:30:04.728 --> 01:30:08.728
gave birth to a beautiful beauty like you

01:30:19.898 --> 01:30:21.108
If I become king

01:30:21.108 --> 01:30:23.438
I guess I'm also in love with you.

01:30:27.108 --> 01:30:29.438
The thing that drives the house to pieces

01:30:29.818 --> 01:30:31.548
It cannot be allowed to exist in this world.

01:32:37.608 --> 01:32:38.518
father.

01:32:38.608 --> 01:32:41.018
You bastard, you really want to kill your father.

01:32:41.648 --> 01:32:42.398
father.

01:32:45.798 --> 01:32:46.748
She's not human

01:32:46.818 --> 01:32:47.768
It's Ho's love.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.358
Protect the king.

01:32:52.858 --> 01:32:53.648
Where are you?

01:33:22.818 --> 01:33:24.108
Co Phat.

01:33:28.148 --> 01:33:29.898
What should we do now?

01:33:35.058 --> 01:33:37.438
This error leads straight to the city gate

01:33:37.538 --> 01:33:40.188
Quickly go find the big sister Ty Can and hide there for a few days

01:33:43.808 --> 01:33:44.768
Let me go

01:33:45.898 --> 01:33:46.688
What about you?

01:33:48.728 --> 01:33:49.898
Give me the Demon Monkey sword.

01:34:02.278 --> 01:34:02.858
Co Phat.

01:34:07.548 --> 01:34:08.518
Sung Ung Biao

01:34:09.278 --> 01:34:10.108
It's very dark inside.

01:34:10.358 --> 01:34:11.818
Let me find you a torch first

01:34:14.028 --> 01:34:14.818
Where are you?

01:34:15.858 --> 01:34:16.648
Bring the torch over here.

01:34:26.528 --> 01:34:28.518
Natural disaster is coming

01:34:28.528 --> 01:34:29.978
The population is rife

01:34:29.978 --> 01:34:32.688
was when our Dai Thuong stood on the brink of collapse

01:34:32.688 --> 01:34:34.108
To prevent natural disasters

01:34:34.108 --> 01:34:35.728
First, prevent refugees

01:34:35.728 --> 01:34:38.518
It is also the king's intention to comfort the people

01:34:38.528 --> 01:34:39.978
North East South West

01:34:39.978 --> 01:34:41.398
four great vassals

01:34:41.398 --> 01:34:43.018
national ungratefulness

01:34:43.028 --> 01:34:44.768
collude in treason

01:34:44.778 --> 01:34:46.648
immediately failed

01:34:46.648 --> 01:34:48.268
Is it because of the continent or because of the people?

01:34:48.278 --> 01:34:49.898
Queen Khuong Thi

01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:51.398
don't keep rules

01:34:51.398 --> 01:34:52.518
Rude and rude language

01:34:52.528 --> 01:34:54.228
Enlightenment feels ashamed

01:34:54.228 --> 01:34:56.148
committed suicide - When he met Bac Bac Hau, he didn't even bow.

01:34:56.148 --> 01:34:57.728
Crown Prince An Giao

01:34:57.728 --> 01:34:59.438
act against morality

01:34:59.438 --> 01:35:01.018
break into the harem

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:02.978
murdered his father

01:35:02.978 --> 01:35:04.938
Failure has escaped

01:35:04.938 --> 01:35:07.568
Wanted nationwide.

01:35:17.858 --> 01:35:20.188
An Giao's Quy Hau sword is indeed sharp

01:35:32.318 --> 01:35:34.068
I've been looking for you for several days now

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.568
Where have you hidden An Giao?

01:35:38.228 --> 01:35:39.228
At the stables?

01:35:39.848 --> 01:35:41.338
Barracks?

01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:44.228
Or is it mutual?

01:35:48.168 --> 01:35:49.718
You bastards

01:35:52.168 --> 01:35:53.038
Any

01:35:53.318 --> 01:35:53.938
come here.

01:36:20.778 --> 01:36:21.648
Like like.

01:36:26.438 --> 01:36:27.938
For the past few years, I've been alone in Trieu Ca

01:36:28.068 --> 01:36:29.478
Probably got caught quite a bit, right?

01:36:30.568 --> 01:36:31.518
There is no such thing.

01:36:33.068 --> 01:36:34.478
Only you bully others.

01:36:34.648 --> 01:36:37.068
That guy, since childhood, has been competitive

01:36:37.528 --> 01:36:39.108
A desire to become a great hero.

01:36:40.028 --> 01:36:42.398
At that time, the Shang Dynasty came to Tay Ky to choose hostages

01:36:43.068 --> 01:36:45.318
Father also appointed two of my brothers to compete in archery

01:36:45.318 --> 01:36:46.688
Whoever wins must go.

01:36:47.228 --> 01:36:48.438
Don't think I don't know

01:36:48.938 --> 01:36:51.518
You secretly broke my arrow.

01:36:51.608 --> 01:36:53.068
If you don't break the arrow

01:36:53.068 --> 01:36:54.228
Can you win?

01:36:56.228 --> 01:36:57.268
I know.

01:36:57.728 --> 01:37:00.188
De is not willing to live a simple life in Tay Ky

01:37:00.818 --> 01:37:03.228
wholeheartedly wanted to go to Trieu Ca to become a general.

01:37:03.978 --> 01:37:06.188
Now I am the matriarch of the royal family

01:37:07.068 --> 01:37:09.068
My brother is also happy for me.

01:37:14.478 --> 01:37:15.188
Ca.

01:37:15.898 --> 01:37:17.398
You are a descendant of Tay Ky

01:37:17.978 --> 01:37:19.398
Should I stay in Tay Ky?

01:37:27.228 --> 01:37:30.268
The carriage outside is filled with strange treasures.

01:37:30.398 --> 01:37:31.318
De See

01:37:32.188 --> 01:37:33.398
Is it enough to save Dad?

01:37:43.148 --> 01:37:45.068
Many strange treasures are useless.

01:37:51.778 --> 01:37:53.058
I also advised my father

01:37:55.338 --> 01:37:57.658
but still refused to admit guilt.

01:37:58.438 --> 01:38:00.518
That's how dad is

01:38:02.358 --> 01:38:04.018
Never did

01:38:05.648 --> 01:38:07.398
Things that are against your heart.

01:38:09.268 --> 01:38:09.898
Ca.

01:38:11.858 --> 01:38:13.068
Don't worry too much

01:38:13.478 --> 01:38:14.788
I'm still thinking about it.

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.148
Stupid kid

01:38:20.608 --> 01:38:22.478
Father is also old and weak

01:38:23.648 --> 01:38:25.358
I'm just afraid I can't wait any longer.

01:38:32.318 --> 01:38:33.688
Tuyet Long Cau.

01:38:37.188 --> 01:38:38.568
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

01:38:38.918 --> 01:38:40.638
Do you guys still recognize me?

01:38:43.378 --> 01:38:45.368
I haven't been back to the West for many years

01:38:45.398 --> 01:38:47.768
I probably can't even remember the way back home

01:38:48.688 --> 01:38:51.768
Dad gave us these two horses a long time ago

01:38:52.438 --> 01:38:54.188
We have also trained them well

01:38:55.358 --> 01:38:56.648
run thousands of miles a day

01:38:57.028 --> 01:38:58.598
Very good at finding directions

01:40:11.858 --> 01:40:13.568
Ky Tran Bi told you to give it to me

01:40:13.568 --> 01:40:14.898
Nothing makes me happy.

01:40:16.438 --> 01:40:17.398
But you

01:40:18.028 --> 01:40:19.628
That makes me the happiest.

01:40:25.398 --> 01:40:26.318
Speak

01:40:26.978 --> 01:40:28.358
What do you want?

01:40:28.738 --> 01:40:30.828
Today, this King has promised you everything.

01:40:51.728 --> 01:40:53.268
Now my father is old and weak

01:40:53.528 --> 01:40:55.568
Fear of not being able to endure imprisonment

01:40:55.698 --> 01:40:57.268
Begged the king for mercy

01:40:57.528 --> 01:40:58.858
Release him to Tay Ky.

01:40:59.028 --> 01:41:00.818
I pray that my father will take the blame

01:41:01.258 --> 01:41:03.258
Your Majesty, please judge me as you please.

01:41:05.358 --> 01:41:07.518
Your father committed that deadly sin.

01:41:12.378 --> 01:41:15.078
I pray that you will die on my father's behalf.

01:42:09.478 --> 01:42:11.018
Co Phat, it's me, it's me.

01:42:13.778 --> 01:42:14.998
You are a lover

01:42:15.608 --> 01:42:18.148
Every time he appeared, nothing nice happened.

01:42:18.778 --> 01:42:19.938
Where is An Giao?

01:42:20.318 --> 01:42:21.148
Quickly take me to pick him up.

01:42:21.148 --> 01:42:22.858
How many people do you want to kill before you stop?

01:42:22.858 --> 01:42:24.268
Now only we can save him

01:42:24.278 --> 01:42:25.938
I can't stay in Trieu Ca anymore.

01:42:28.628 --> 01:42:30.138
Last time let him escape

01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:31.688
This time he brought himself here.

01:42:32.648 --> 01:42:33.518
Don't say those things anymore

01:42:33.528 --> 01:42:35.068
You quickly come with me.

01:42:36.228 --> 01:42:37.648
Leave Trieu Ca

01:42:37.878 --> 01:42:39.848
Kunlun will protect you.

01:42:40.228 --> 01:42:42.318
You are the future monarch of the world

01:42:42.898 --> 01:42:44.228
It is my next hope

01:42:44.228 --> 01:42:44.898
this world.

01:42:47.108 --> 01:42:49.018
The new king is the future monarch of the world

01:42:49.268 --> 01:42:50.688
He is the one who opened the Deification Table

01:42:50.728 --> 01:42:51.938
will be the one to save this entire world.

01:42:53.178 --> 01:42:54.778
I told you, old man

01:42:55.318 --> 01:42:56.748
he doesn't believe you.

01:42:57.068 --> 01:42:58.478
You still don't believe it?

01:42:58.508 --> 01:43:00.838
His father was just fascinated by the Ho demon

01:43:01.918 --> 01:43:03.738
Blessings and misfortunes do not come by themselves

01:43:04.728 --> 01:43:06.358
Only opened by the person themselves

01:43:07.428 --> 01:43:09.278
heart with evil thoughts

01:43:10.108 --> 01:43:12.068
Evil comes by itself.

01:43:13.438 --> 01:43:14.858
You try to think again

01:43:15.688 --> 01:43:20.898
What if your father wasn't bewitched by the Demon Fox?

01:43:25.228 --> 01:43:27.018
If we can lure the evil spirits out

01:43:27.028 --> 01:43:28.318
Kill the Ho demon

01:43:28.318 --> 01:43:31.358
The real price will be clear immediately.

01:43:38.728 --> 01:43:41.518
Marquis of Tay Ba, you have suffered.

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:46.648
is about to kill me.

01:44:00.728 --> 01:44:02.398
I also admire you very much

01:44:03.108 --> 01:44:04.818
have two good sons like So.

01:44:06.068 --> 01:44:07.568
As for me

01:44:07.798 --> 01:44:09.698
There is only one son

01:44:10.058 --> 01:44:11.718
then it wants to kill me.

01:44:13.478 --> 01:44:14.978
Also a parent

01:44:15.998 --> 01:44:17.818
Why are we so unhappy?

01:44:19.898 --> 01:44:23.318
How did you treat your father?

01:44:23.978 --> 01:44:28.898
It's hard to avoid your son treating you like that.

01:44:29.568 --> 01:44:30.978
But do you know?

01:44:31.528 --> 01:44:33.688
How does my father treat me?

01:44:47.818 --> 01:44:49.688
You are the one I admire

01:44:50.778 --> 01:44:52.398
What should we do?

01:44:52.818 --> 01:44:55.018
I pray to listen to your lord's instructions.

01:44:57.528 --> 01:45:00.148
If you keep your promise

01:45:01.068 --> 01:45:02.718
suffer sacrifice

01:45:03.228 --> 01:45:04.898
his sin

01:45:05.818 --> 01:45:08.148
New Cleaning ability.

01:45:09.368 --> 01:45:14.348
He is not ashamed of Thuong's descendants

01:45:15.858 --> 01:45:17.398
merely

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:21.228
Can you do it?

01:45:32.528 --> 01:45:35.978
Ba Ap Khao has arrived at Trieu Ca

01:45:37.148 --> 01:45:38.478
Where is it now?

01:45:42.858 --> 01:45:45.388
You love your son so much

01:45:46.008 --> 01:45:50.328
Could it be that you don't recognize his taste?

01:45:56.728 --> 01:45:58.688
Ferocious tigers do not eat their cubs

01:46:00.458 --> 01:46:03.418
You are not even equal to animals.

01:46:14.948 --> 01:46:17.088
You should try it too.

01:46:20.108 --> 01:46:21.728
Give it a try.

01:46:23.228 --> 01:46:24.858
Try it.

01:46:30.618 --> 01:46:33.608
Animals Born

01:46:33.938 --> 01:46:36.318
kill me.

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:39.728
I have promised Ba Ap Khao

01:46:39.808 --> 01:46:41.488
Not kill you

01:46:41.818 --> 01:46:43.188
I'll even let you go.

01:46:44.458 --> 01:46:46.398
You know what to do, right?

01:46:54.438 --> 01:46:55.768
Do not forget

01:46:56.528 --> 01:47:00.148
and your other son is in my hand.

01:47:49.228 --> 01:47:51.268
I am guilty.

01:47:53.028 --> 01:47:56.518
I falsified fortune-telling hexagrams.

01:47:56.818 --> 01:48:00.068
We colluded in rebellion.

01:48:00.858 --> 01:48:04.018
I instigated treason.

01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:08.478
I am a sinner

01:48:08.478 --> 01:48:11.398
Crime is hard to forgive.

01:48:13.068 --> 01:48:15.398
I am guilty.

01:48:16.318 --> 01:48:19.898
I falsified fortune-telling hexagrams.

01:48:19.898 --> 01:48:23.438
I colluded in treason.

01:48:24.108 --> 01:48:25.188
Facing...

01:48:26.608 --> 01:48:29.938
I instigated treason.

01:48:33.148 --> 01:48:36.728
I falsified fortune-telling hexagrams.

01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:41.648
I colluded in treason.

01:48:43.358 --> 01:48:44.938
Facing...

01:48:45.898 --> 01:48:47.478
Treasonous plotter.

01:48:49.278 --> 01:48:50.858
I am a sinner.

01:49:01.858 --> 01:49:03.438
Facing...

01:49:03.438 --> 01:49:07.018
I falsified fortune-telling hexagrams.

01:49:17.898 --> 01:49:19.898
An Tho's nephew is incompetent

01:49:19.898 --> 01:49:22.818
Together with the beauty To Thi, he went to pay his respects to his ancestors

01:49:23.978 --> 01:49:26.438
Pray for the ancestors' blessings.

01:49:35.608 --> 01:49:37.648
Come over here

01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:40.938
Let your ancestors see you more clearly.

01:49:57.188 --> 01:50:00.568
There are women like that in the human world

01:50:01.108 --> 01:50:05.358
If you don't see it with your own eyes, it's hard to believe.

01:50:06.438 --> 01:50:08.268
Give me your hand.

01:50:17.188 --> 01:50:17.978
Support love

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:21.358
I have covered your meridians

01:50:21.938 --> 01:50:23.608
Go to die.

01:50:23.608 --> 01:50:26.018
Uncle Vuong, why do you say she is a demon fox?

01:50:27.178 --> 01:50:28.738
An Giao.

01:50:34.278 --> 01:50:37.858
You naughty boy, it turns out you've been hiding here for a long time.

01:50:43.358 --> 01:50:45.018
The demon fox has entered To Dat Ky's body

01:50:45.898 --> 01:50:47.648
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:50:48.978 --> 01:50:50.518
I accidentally harmed my father

01:50:50.528 --> 01:50:52.728
It's also because I want to kill this evil monster

01:50:53.178 --> 01:50:54.698
revenge for his mother.

01:50:55.158 --> 01:50:57.258
She is by my side every day

01:50:57.858 --> 01:50:59.688
She's Demon Fox, how come I don't know?

01:50:59.688 --> 01:51:01.108
Let me kill her

01:51:01.108 --> 01:51:04.438
will reveal the Demon Fox's true form immediately.

01:51:04.938 --> 01:51:06.688
If she isn't Demon Ho

01:51:06.718 --> 01:51:08.938
Didn't you kill innocent people?

01:51:12.818 --> 01:51:15.858
The body is the great destiny of Dai Thuong

01:51:16.228 --> 01:51:19.188
In people there are "Seven soulful, sparkling hearts"

01:51:20.148 --> 01:51:22.018
Just eat my heart

01:51:22.078 --> 01:51:23.618
What evil?

01:51:23.978 --> 01:51:27.648
Immediately revealed his true form.

01:51:28.068 --> 01:51:30.818
Is Uncle Vuong willing to open his heart for this matter?

01:51:31.068 --> 01:51:32.728
Because of the Shang dynasty's inheritance

01:51:32.988 --> 01:51:34.678
Because of the Thuong dynasty's rule

01:51:35.688 --> 01:51:38.268
What do I miss about this heart?

01:51:43.938 --> 01:51:48.728
If To Dat Ky clearly shows the true form of the Ho demon

01:51:48.858 --> 01:51:51.268
How does the king intend to handle it?

01:51:54.418 --> 01:51:55.918
Listen to it all.

01:51:56.538 --> 01:51:58.248
Pursuing Demon Lake

01:51:59.438 --> 01:52:01.728
Announced An Giao Innocent.

01:52:02.478 --> 01:52:05.108
Vindication of the 4 Marquis.

01:52:05.898 --> 01:52:08.298
Before the spirit of the ancestors of the ancestors

01:52:08.478 --> 01:52:11.898
do you dare promise?

01:52:16.218 --> 01:52:18.808
Paralysis of ancestors and paralysis of ancestors proves dare

01:52:19.738 --> 01:52:21.488
I promise you, uncle.

01:52:22.318 --> 01:52:24.378
Uncle, absolutely not.

01:52:43.788 --> 01:52:45.208
Eat quickly.

01:53:25.858 --> 01:53:28.228
Ho Yeu, do not harm the king.

01:53:31.778 --> 01:53:33.148
The demon fox appears

01:53:33.228 --> 01:53:36.148
Your Majesty, please order to kill me immediately.

01:53:39.978 --> 01:53:41.818
High ancestors

01:53:42.228 --> 01:53:45.898
An Tho, why don't you hurry up and take action?

01:53:48.528 --> 01:53:49.478
Ancestry?

01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:56.318
Where are the ancestors?

01:54:00.188 --> 01:54:02.398
If you call, will you respond?

01:54:04.318 --> 01:54:06.398
You all say Bach Ho is evil

01:54:08.778 --> 01:54:10.898
she is clearly a good omen.

01:54:13.228 --> 01:54:16.518
Only she knows what I want

01:54:17.818 --> 01:54:18.938
What you want

01:54:20.028 --> 01:54:25.438
is to become king of the entire world.

01:54:37.858 --> 01:54:39.018
Dai Thuong

01:54:39.728 --> 01:54:41.228
it's about to end.

01:54:44.608 --> 01:54:45.268
Great destiny.

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:46.938
Dai Thuong

01:54:47.568 --> 01:54:50.518
It's really about to perish.

01:54:57.108 --> 01:54:58.688
Uncle Ho.

01:55:00.228 --> 01:55:01.478
Dai Thuong

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:07.228
Quickly take Dai Tu's order away.

01:55:27.028 --> 01:55:29.268
What's funny?

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:33.768
I thought you were fascinated by Ho's love

01:55:35.378 --> 01:55:38.208
Therefore, I still cherish hope for you

01:55:38.648 --> 01:55:40.478
thought people would change

01:55:40.478 --> 01:55:42.818
is an admirable father

01:55:43.108 --> 01:55:44.688
and respect as before.

01:55:45.188 --> 01:55:46.818
I'm so disappointed.

01:55:49.528 --> 01:55:52.568
It's all caused by us.

01:55:57.108 --> 01:55:58.978
This life of mine was given to me by you

01:56:00.728 --> 01:56:02.698
We return it to that person.

01:56:05.438 --> 01:56:06.188
An Giao.

01:56:20.188 --> 01:56:21.268
Where are you?

01:56:25.108 --> 01:56:26.358
Pull it out completely.

01:56:35.498 --> 01:56:37.298
Tomorrow I will personally execute you.

01:56:46.308 --> 01:56:48.678
Don't think I don't know what you did.

01:56:48.738 --> 01:56:50.058
Co Phat did not dare.

01:57:03.278 --> 01:57:04.908
So many substances

01:57:06.108 --> 01:57:08.068
I only trust you.

01:57:09.438 --> 01:57:11.858
Because the first day you came to Trieu Ca

01:57:11.858 --> 01:57:13.518
told me

01:57:13.978 --> 01:57:16.398
you want to become a great hero

01:57:18.228 --> 01:57:20.358
We are the same class of people

01:57:21.568 --> 01:57:22.478
so

01:57:23.978 --> 01:57:26.368
I will give you one more chance

01:57:26.848 --> 01:57:28.738
Go kill Co Xuong immediately.

01:57:31.688 --> 01:57:32.478
Henceforth

01:57:34.278 --> 01:57:37.318
You are my biological son

01:57:38.068 --> 01:57:40.148
Crown Prince of Dai Thuong.

01:57:41.778 --> 01:57:43.648
Don't let me be disappointed anymore.

01:57:51.568 --> 01:57:53.898
I am a sinner.

01:57:55.068 --> 01:57:58.398
Heinous crime.

01:58:00.978 --> 01:58:03.188
I am guilty.

01:58:22.008 --> 01:58:24.948
I thought I would never see the sun again.

01:58:26.068 --> 01:58:27.568
it was he who saved me.

01:58:28.898 --> 01:58:30.478
I practiced for thousands of years

01:58:31.188 --> 01:58:33.288
I just want to turn into a human.

01:58:33.398 --> 01:58:35.398
Live a life of freedom.

01:58:37.628 --> 01:58:41.658
But the ancestors of the Shang Dynasty sealed me in Huyen Suy

01:58:43.028 --> 01:58:44.268
500 years ago

01:58:46.338 --> 01:58:50.618
Only the blood of the descendants of the Shang Dynasty can break the blessing

01:58:51.438 --> 01:58:55.228
It was he who brought us back to the human world

01:58:58.858 --> 01:59:00.648
To repay your favor

01:59:01.438 --> 01:59:03.688
I used the technique of borrowing my body and restoring my soul

01:59:04.108 --> 01:59:06.358
entered To Dat Ky's body,

01:59:07.258 --> 01:59:09.328
help you do what you want most,

01:59:10.148 --> 01:59:12.978
Let him get what he wants most.

01:59:16.688 --> 01:59:18.478
I will help people live forever

01:59:20.228 --> 01:59:21.898
reign forever.

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:41.268
I am loyal to the king

01:59:41.278 --> 01:59:43.068
like the sun and moon

01:59:44.108 --> 01:59:47.228
is the root of society.

01:59:48.438 --> 01:59:50.318
I am filial to my father

01:59:50.608 --> 01:59:52.438
Like respecting the sky

01:59:52.658 --> 01:59:55.268
the right way to be human.

01:59:56.278 --> 01:59:59.898
Therefore, from ancient times to modern times, it is a great sin

01:59:59.898 --> 02:00:02.568
It was an attempt to kill his father

02:00:04.398 --> 02:00:06.068
immoral and ethical.

02:00:08.148 --> 02:00:10.478
Skeletal Muscle aka Skeletal Muscle

02:00:10.728 --> 02:00:11.938
two of us

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:14.858
In the end, who died at the hands of their loved ones?

02:00:14.858 --> 02:00:16.568
An Tho

02:00:18.028 --> 02:00:21.898
Even if I die, I won't let you go.

02:00:22.108 --> 02:00:23.768
Immediately executed.

02:00:35.778 --> 02:00:38.378
Na Tra, Duong Tien, where are you?

02:00:50.658 --> 02:00:51.898
Tay Ky brothers

02:00:52.438 --> 02:00:53.818
Quickly save An Giao.

02:01:04.188 --> 02:01:05.108
Stop them.

02:01:10.438 --> 02:01:12.938
You have the audacity to deceive me!

02:01:14.648 --> 02:01:16.068
Release An Giao immediately

02:01:16.068 --> 02:01:17.148
otherwise I will kill you.

02:01:19.688 --> 02:01:21.068
You don't have that guts.

02:01:33.528 --> 02:01:34.268
Fraternal people

02:01:34.648 --> 02:01:35.688
Let me see you off for a bit.

02:02:08.528 --> 02:02:10.648
Do you still want to kill me?

02:02:11.318 --> 02:02:12.358
Do not forget

02:02:13.028 --> 02:02:15.398
Your swordsmanship was taught by me.

02:02:15.688 --> 02:02:16.858
Rescue Co Phat.

02:02:35.318 --> 02:02:37.438
Na Tra, Duong Tien, I'm here.

02:02:39.148 --> 02:02:40.018
Uncle.

02:02:41.318 --> 02:02:42.768
Let's go.

02:02:42.898 --> 02:02:45.438
Leave me alone, take An Giao first.

02:02:45.818 --> 02:02:48.018
An Giao was cut in half and died.

02:02:48.028 --> 02:02:48.938
Stop talking nonsense

02:02:48.938 --> 02:02:51.268
Just take him back to Kunlun and talk.

02:03:08.938 --> 02:03:10.298
Water release.

02:03:18.318 --> 02:03:19.478
Go fast So.

02:03:55.648 --> 02:03:57.268
God will not kill you

02:03:57.568 --> 02:03:58.438
let me.

02:04:27.068 --> 02:04:28.768
The king is dead.

02:04:29.478 --> 02:04:33.108
Now everyone obeys the Northern lord's orders to serve us.

02:04:54.148 --> 02:04:56.108
Stop Co Phat immediately.

02:05:10.688 --> 02:05:12.108
Why are you still staying in Trieu Ca?

02:05:12.318 --> 02:05:13.478
Life is over.

02:05:24.528 --> 02:05:25.688
Soul migration

02:06:02.938 --> 02:06:04.358
An Tho is dead

02:06:04.598 --> 02:06:06.068
We killed him.

02:06:08.398 --> 02:06:10.938
Surely I am an ancient sinner.

02:06:11.188 --> 02:06:12.978
Block them.

02:06:21.188 --> 02:06:24.108
Khuong Van Hoan, if you want to avenge him, take action.

02:06:25.608 --> 02:06:27.068
Go ahead.

02:06:54.228 --> 02:06:55.398
Collect troops.

02:06:57.938 --> 02:06:58.728
Let it go.

02:07:05.148 --> 02:07:06.398
Go.

02:07:16.818 --> 02:07:18.018
Close the gate.

02:07:18.148 --> 02:07:19.358
Welcoming the enemy.

02:07:44.898 --> 02:07:45.938
Someone entered the camp,

02:07:45.938 --> 02:07:46.978
Chase.

02:07:52.358 --> 02:07:53.398
Stop it quickly.

02:08:00.358 --> 02:08:01.148
It's a violation.

02:08:22.278 --> 02:08:23.768
Go into the forest.

02:08:25.318 --> 02:08:26.978
Quick, see you off.

02:08:34.688 --> 02:08:35.978
What is this?

02:09:05.358 --> 02:09:06.268
Launch arrows.

02:09:17.688 --> 02:09:19.648
Co Phat, run away yourself

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.648
Let them chase us.

02:09:23.438 --> 02:09:24.688
I still have something I want to borrow from you.

02:09:24.898 --> 02:09:25.688
Huh?

02:10:53.148 --> 02:10:56.398
Fellow monks, please stop.

02:11:05.278 --> 02:11:06.898
why you?

02:12:30.318 --> 02:12:33.938
Khuong Tu Nha, you can't escape.

02:12:59.188 --> 02:13:00.768
Who are you?

02:13:12.318 --> 02:13:14.068
Loi Chan Tu.

02:13:22.068 --> 02:13:23.398
Baby?

02:13:24.938 --> 02:13:27.438
Let go home.

02:14:11.068 --> 02:14:14.858
In the past, my father gave us these two Snow Dragons

02:14:15.148 --> 02:14:16.978
We have also trained them well.

02:14:17.858 --> 02:14:19.768
When do you want to return?

02:14:19.938 --> 02:14:21.818
Just tell them 2 words

02:14:22.068 --> 02:14:23.358
go home

02:14:23.858 --> 02:14:25.518
They will take you back to Tay Ky.

02:14:35.188 --> 02:14:36.768
Pearl ring.

02:14:41.028 --> 02:14:42.068
Cha.

02:14:43.358 --> 02:14:45.608
I will definitely return to Tay Ky.

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:54.148
Pearl ring.

02:15:14.278 --> 02:15:16.108
Go home.

02:15:56.938 --> 02:15:58.318
Tuyet Long Cau.

02:15:58.478 --> 02:16:00.478
The young master has returned.

02:16:16.938 --> 02:16:17.768
Cha.

02:16:43.938 --> 02:16:45.268
Come here.

02:17:06.778 --> 02:17:07.817
Cha

02:17:11.858 --> 02:17:13.608
I'm back.

02:24:46.858 --> 02:24:49.818
Grand Master of the Shang Dynasty, Van Trong

02:24:49.818 --> 02:24:55.478
Conquering the North for more than ten years

02:24:55.608 --> 02:24:59.438
Now we return victorious.
