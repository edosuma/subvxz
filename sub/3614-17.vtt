WEBVTT

00:04.769 --> 00:09.638
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

00:09.809 --> 00:15.281
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

00:15.449 --> 00:21.319
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

00:21.649 --> 00:24.402
- Are you all right?
- Just keep chanting.

00:24.609 --> 00:26.520
We've been chanting
for 15 minutes.

00:26.729 --> 00:31.757
It's a sÃ©ance, Amanda, not AT&T.
He'll come, he has to. Come on.

00:31.929 --> 00:37.242
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

00:37.689 --> 00:43.161
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

00:50.129 --> 00:52.324
Who dares summon me?

00:52.529 --> 00:55.362
Three who are humbled
by your presence, Kryto.

00:55.569 --> 00:59.482
- What do you want?
- That which only you can give.

00:59.929 --> 01:04.286
Youth, beauty, health.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.798
What can you give me?

01:07.689 --> 01:09.566
We know how to make
you whole again.

01:09.729 --> 01:12.448
- We can bring you back.
- But I want more.

01:12.609 --> 01:16.363
I want powers. Great powers.

01:16.569 --> 01:20.847
- Don't ever summon me again.
- We can get you great powers.

01:22.609 --> 01:25.407
The power to move things
with your mind,

01:25.569 --> 01:28.925
to stop time, to see into the future.

01:29.129 --> 01:32.678
Do so, and you'll have your youth.

01:34.209 --> 01:36.439
I had to say something.
We were losing him.

01:36.649 --> 01:38.241
You lost him already, Gail.

01:38.729 --> 01:41.641
Why would you promise him
something we can't get?

01:41.809 --> 01:43.128
What if it makes him angry?

01:43.529 --> 01:46.123
I can get the powers, Helen.
I have to.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.325
I'm not ready to die.

01:48.769 --> 01:54.480
I'll be back. Just be sure you have
the quilt finished by tomorrow night.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

02:18.769 --> 02:21.761
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. What's up?

02:22.289 --> 02:25.122
Have you made an appointment
to see the optometrist yet?

02:25.329 --> 02:28.162
Prue, I keep telling you,
I do not need glasses.

02:28.329 --> 02:30.524
Oh, well, then...

02:31.249 --> 02:33.205
...this might help.

02:34.409 --> 02:35.683
Unrelated.

02:35.849 --> 02:39.205
Look, I really need your help.
Piper's throwing out her boots.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.843
The tan ones.

02:47.809 --> 02:50.039
Piper, what are you doing?
Those are your favourite boots.

02:50.209 --> 02:52.439
I know. Demon blood
from one of our vanquishings.

02:52.609 --> 02:56.284
And I can't get it out, and I can't exactly
explain it to the shoe-repair guy, can I?

02:56.449 --> 02:58.519
It's the third damn pair this month.

02:58.689 --> 03:01.442
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.

03:01.609 --> 03:03.804
I gotta go to the club.
Dan's waiting for me.

03:03.969 --> 03:05.561
Are you really gonna
break up with him?

03:06.089 --> 03:09.718
I have to. I mean, I love him,
but I love Leo more.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.723
Not that I'm any closer to figuring out
how that's gonna work either.

03:14.329 --> 03:16.843
Sometimes being a witch sucks.

03:18.609 --> 03:20.008
Wicca PMS?

03:20.169 --> 03:22.888
I have a feeling
it's a lot more than that.

03:30.129 --> 03:33.405
- Aunt Gail.
- My beautiful girls.

03:33.609 --> 03:35.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:18.089 --> 05:21.365
I knew we had an old picture of you
and Grams somewhere.

05:22.449 --> 05:25.759
Oh, my God.
Look how young we were.

05:26.569 --> 05:29.686
I remember when this was taken
right outside our sorority house.

05:29.849 --> 05:31.885
- We just met.
- A couple of hotties.

05:32.049 --> 05:35.121
Well, that was then. This is now.

05:35.289 --> 05:37.007
Hey, now looks pretty good.

05:37.169 --> 05:40.525
Believe me, the golden years
are anything but.

05:40.689 --> 05:42.441
Mostly it's regret.

05:44.809 --> 05:48.484
Oh, I miss your Grams.
I still can't believe she's gone.

05:50.609 --> 05:53.203
You just never know
when it's your time, do you?

05:53.369 --> 05:56.918
Anyway, you both sound
like you're doing very well.

05:57.089 --> 06:01.685
You and Piper and your careers,
and you back in school.

06:01.889 --> 06:04.608
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we're doing all right.

06:04.769 --> 06:07.567
What about men?
Anyone special in your lives?

06:07.769 --> 06:09.122
Nope.

06:09.329 --> 06:13.368
Well, I mean,
Piper's got someone, sort of.

06:13.529 --> 06:15.520
I think we're just picky.
We don't wanna go through

06:15.689 --> 06:17.281
all the husbands that
Grams went through.

06:17.849 --> 06:18.964
Don't be too picky.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.882
You don't wanna end up
an old spinster like me.

06:23.769 --> 06:25.566
Are you okay?

06:25.729 --> 06:27.685
Here, have some of this.

06:30.769 --> 06:33.727
Thank you. Damn allergies.

06:33.889 --> 06:36.847
So, what brings you
to San Francisco?

06:37.849 --> 06:40.158
Well...

06:40.689 --> 06:42.884
...my dears...

06:44.329 --> 06:46.684
...you do.

06:47.369 --> 06:49.087
Do you remember
the bridge clubs

06:49.249 --> 06:52.207
your Grams always hosted
here every other Saturday?

06:52.729 --> 06:56.039
Did you actually see
any of us play any cards?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.286
No, Grams always
sent us outside to play.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.680
That's because it wasn't
a bridge club.

07:02.849 --> 07:05.124
It was her coven.

07:06.449 --> 07:10.840
Your Grams was the most
skilful witch any of us ever knew.

07:11.649 --> 07:14.117
- Witch?
- Oh, well, I still practice

07:14.289 --> 07:17.281
the craft myself every now and then.
I don't have any real powers.

07:17.449 --> 07:20.043
Mostly I just play around with it.

07:20.209 --> 07:23.565
Wow. You and Grams,
witches, who knew?

07:24.049 --> 07:27.280
You don't have to pretend with me.
Your Grams told me everything,

07:27.449 --> 07:31.328
including what you'd become
when she died.

07:32.249 --> 07:34.968
The Charmed Ones.

07:45.009 --> 07:47.398
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:47.609 --> 07:50.077
You're... You're late.

07:50.249 --> 07:52.319
Sorry, a little jet lag.

07:57.849 --> 07:59.919
I was walking by a store window
on Fifth Avenue,

08:00.089 --> 08:04.162
- and I couldn't resist.
- Oh, no.

08:08.209 --> 08:10.848
Please don't be a ring.

08:15.489 --> 08:17.923
I hope you like it.

08:21.809 --> 08:23.481
They're beautiful.

08:23.649 --> 08:26.527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:28.249 --> 08:32.207
- If you don't like them, you can...
- It's not that, Dan, it's...

08:32.769 --> 08:37.558
- Did you think it was a ring?
- No, of course not. Don't be silly.

08:38.129 --> 08:40.198
It's just that...

08:40.969 --> 08:45.042
- Did you need to get that?
- No, the machine will pick it up.

08:45.209 --> 08:47.518
- Hi. Leave a message.
- Dan, we have to talk.

08:47.729 --> 08:50.880
Piper, it's me. Look, I know
you're there. Just pick up.

08:51.049 --> 08:53.438
- Talk about what?
- Well, to be honest...

08:53.609 --> 08:57.761
Aunt Gail's in town and guess what.
She knows we're you-know-whats.

08:59.729 --> 09:01.447
Hi. I'm not alone here, remember?

09:01.649 --> 09:03.526
I thought that that
would get your attention.

09:03.689 --> 09:05.884
Prue, this is a really bad time.

09:06.049 --> 09:08.199
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
but it's important.

09:08.409 --> 09:10.877
Hey, wait. How does
Aunt Gail know that we're...?

09:11.049 --> 09:14.166
You know what, never mind. You can
tell me later. I have to go, Dan is here.

09:14.369 --> 09:16.599
Look, Aunt Gail needs our help.
She's in trouble.

09:16.809 --> 09:18.083
What do you mean?
What kind of trouble?

09:18.289 --> 09:22.123
The kind of trouble you can't talk about
with Dan right there. Demon trouble.

09:22.569 --> 09:23.968
Of course, why not.

09:24.129 --> 09:28.202
All right, I'll just put my life on hold
one more time and I'll be right there.

09:30.689 --> 09:34.079
- A little trouble at home?
- When isn't there?

09:35.009 --> 09:37.842
Well, you wanna talk about it
on the way to your car?

09:38.009 --> 09:40.284
No, I don't.

09:41.089 --> 09:42.920
How about dinner tonight?

09:43.089 --> 09:45.125
Let's make it tomorrow night
just to be safe.

09:45.289 --> 09:48.361
- I don't wanna have to cancel on you.
- It's a date.

10:06.449 --> 10:09.327
- Have you contacted the police yet?
- And tell them what?

10:09.489 --> 10:12.526
That I think there's a demon
running loose in our streets?

10:12.729 --> 10:15.482
- They'd think I was crazy.
- Try getting your boots cleaned.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.438
Don't ask.

10:17.609 --> 10:20.248
So you said that corpses
have been found dug up and skinned.

10:20.409 --> 10:22.286
I mean, what do the police
think about that?

10:22.449 --> 10:25.407
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's just a sicko grave robber.

10:25.569 --> 10:27.764
Well, it's more than that.

10:27.969 --> 10:32.918
I may be wrong, but I think I remember
seeing in your Book of Shadows that...

10:35.289 --> 10:36.961
Okay, wait,
you know about that too?

10:37.529 --> 10:39.997
And one evening when
your Grams was showing it to me,

10:40.169 --> 10:42.763
I think that I remember
seeing something

10:42.929 --> 10:47.445
about a skinned demon, or something,
who made people young again.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.446
Young again? Well,
what's so bad about that?

10:49.969 --> 10:53.120
There's gotta be a catch.
There's always a catch.

10:53.329 --> 10:56.366
Are you sure that the book
said it was skinned?

10:57.009 --> 11:02.083
I think so. But maybe
we better go look.

11:08.569 --> 11:11.083
- You ready?
- All set.

11:11.289 --> 11:13.086
Okay.

11:18.729 --> 11:21.402
Do you think Gail will really
be able to get their powers?

11:21.569 --> 11:25.164
Well, she better, and soon.
The skin quilt is almost done.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.880
Here's something.
"Kryto, the demon of vanity."

11:31.049 --> 11:34.928
Kryto, that sounds vaguely familiar.
What does it say?

11:35.089 --> 11:38.365
"In the 16th century, Kryto travelled
from dukedom to dukedom

11:38.529 --> 11:41.123
preying on people's vanity,
bestowing youth and beauty

11:41.289 --> 11:43.200
in exchange for their souls."

11:43.369 --> 11:45.599
Youth for souls. Why would
anybody make that trade?

11:45.809 --> 11:48.323
Believe me, I know a lot
of people who'd consider it.

11:48.489 --> 11:50.559
Age, disease.

11:51.889 --> 11:53.607
That's why I'm so worried.

11:53.769 --> 11:58.206
I know so many potential victims
in Santa Costa, friends.

12:01.169 --> 12:03.524
- Are you squinting?
- No.

12:04.809 --> 12:07.846
"Kryto was found out and skinned alive
by a group of witches

12:08.009 --> 12:12.525
who believed it would keep his spirit
from ever being resurrected again."

12:12.929 --> 12:15.443
- You were right.
- But those witches obviously weren't.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.679
Otherwise, there wouldn't be
a vanquishing spell in the book.

12:17.889 --> 12:21.199
So someone is skinning people
to give him a new skin?

12:21.409 --> 12:25.288
Well, give him a new body,
summon his spirit, makes sense.

12:25.489 --> 12:27.605
Well, at least it's an easy
vanquishing spell.

12:27.769 --> 12:29.122
I mean, if Kryto really does exist,

12:29.289 --> 12:31.405
it shouldn't be a problem
getting rid of him.

12:31.569 --> 12:34.288
Goodness, you must be
really powerful witches.

12:34.489 --> 12:36.480
Oh, rub it in.

12:38.449 --> 12:40.758
How soon can you come
to Santa Costa?

12:40.969 --> 12:44.848
Prue, Phoebe, can I talk to you
for a sec out here?

12:46.649 --> 12:48.560
Take your time.

13:01.209 --> 13:04.281
Piper, Gail is like family.
You love her. We all do.

13:04.449 --> 13:05.882
She was like a second Grams to us.

13:06.049 --> 13:08.085
Yeah, only a nice one,
one that never said no.

13:08.489 --> 13:11.606
I know that. But something about
her story... It's just... It's not right.

13:11.769 --> 13:13.839
I mean, bodies are being
dug up all over town,

13:14.009 --> 13:15.806
skinned, and she's
the only one who's noticing?

13:16.009 --> 13:18.523
I admit it's funky, but what
are we supposed to do?

13:18.689 --> 13:21.078
- Tell her we're not gonna help her?
- No, of course not.

13:21.249 --> 13:24.082
It's just that it's never-ending.
I mean we have no lives.

13:24.249 --> 13:26.558
I don't even have time
to break up with Dan properly.

13:48.969 --> 13:51.358
Look, honey, Santa Costa
is right over the bridge.

13:51.529 --> 13:55.204
We'll leave early, go check things out,
be back by tomorrow night, okay?

13:55.409 --> 13:58.924
Hi. So we'll be there at 9:00
tomorrow morning, okay?

13:59.089 --> 14:01.080
Would you like to stay here?
We have plenty of room.

14:01.289 --> 14:06.204
Oh, no thank you, I have to get home.
Cats to feed, you know. Thank you.

14:06.369 --> 14:09.008
You'll never know how much
this means to me.

14:15.009 --> 14:20.242
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

14:20.409 --> 14:25.767
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

14:45.569 --> 14:47.844
Well done, ladies.

14:49.009 --> 14:51.569
Now, make us young.

14:51.769 --> 14:54.602
First, the powers you promised.

14:56.009 --> 14:58.603
They'll be here soon.

15:25.569 --> 15:27.525
Nice work, Pheebs.
Only a couple hours late.

15:27.689 --> 15:30.965
- Yeah, next time I'll navigate.
- It's this map. It's messed up.

15:31.129 --> 15:34.007
There is no connector road
on Highway 28.

15:34.209 --> 15:37.679
No? What is that?

15:38.969 --> 15:42.325
- That little squiggle?
- Yeah.

15:43.369 --> 15:46.327
I didn't see that. And don't tell me
I need glasses, okay,

15:46.489 --> 15:48.081
because anybody
could've missed that.

15:48.249 --> 15:50.638
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with wearing glasses.

15:50.809 --> 15:53.528
- I mean, I wear them.
- I know, but you're older.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.879
- Well, you are.
- Right.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.206
Well, you know, I really hope
that demon of vanity isn't after you

16:00.369 --> 16:01.722
because your soul would be toast.

16:01.889 --> 16:04.687
I'm just gonna ignore that comment
and go ask for directions.

16:04.849 --> 16:06.567
Okay.

16:11.129 --> 16:13.802
Cute, huh? Still holding hands.

16:14.489 --> 16:17.686
That could be you and Leo
in, like, 50 years.

16:18.209 --> 16:21.804
Me maybe, but not Leo.
Whitelighters don't age, remember?

16:21.969 --> 16:23.721
They're not supposed
to date witches either,

16:23.889 --> 16:26.039
so maybe I don't
have to worry about that.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.881
Piper.

16:28.049 --> 16:30.199
I know, I'm sorry
I've been a drag lately,

16:30.369 --> 16:32.564
but I've just been confused
and frustrated.

16:32.969 --> 16:35.358
I mean, nothing's changed really
since Leo and I met,

16:35.529 --> 16:39.442
except that I'm two years older
and still have no idea what we're doing.

16:39.729 --> 16:43.358
Sometimes I worry we're all gonna
end up like Aunt Gail.

16:45.409 --> 16:47.923
Then you take Hotsman to the light.

16:48.089 --> 16:51.320
You turn right, pass
the fire station to Sycamore.

16:51.489 --> 16:54.003
Yeah, and then straight up the hill,

16:54.169 --> 16:56.842
and there's a big Victorian
on the left.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.563
Well, you can't miss it. It's not far.

16:59.729 --> 17:02.641
Okay, straight up the hill.
Great. Thanks.

17:02.849 --> 17:06.444
- Pheebs, come on.
- Okay, okay.

17:07.329 --> 17:09.205
Oh, excuse me, honey.

17:09.409 --> 17:11.877
These your glasses?

17:13.049 --> 17:15.563
No, no.

17:15.729 --> 17:17.878
No, those aren't mine.

17:19.209 --> 17:22.645
We are all set.
All words, no squigglies.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.560
Let's go.

17:41.249 --> 17:43.479
- They're here.
- Finally.

17:43.649 --> 17:45.924
How long after
they drink the potion

17:46.089 --> 17:48.239
before we can
call their powers to Kryto?

17:48.409 --> 17:49.842
It doesn't say.

17:50.009 --> 17:52.569
But it shouldn't be long.

18:05.769 --> 18:08.966
- More tea, girls?
- No thanks. I...

18:09.689 --> 18:12.157
...would love some. Thank you.

18:12.329 --> 18:14.923
- How about you?
- It's better to humour her, Piper.

18:15.089 --> 18:16.727
She won't take no for an answer.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.079
Well, then, by all means, fill her up.

18:19.249 --> 18:24.118
So, Aunt Gail, who else knows
about Kryto and us?

18:24.329 --> 18:28.288
Well, I hope you won't be too upset.
I had to tell Amanda and Helen.

18:28.449 --> 18:32.488
Actually, they were the first ones
to tell me about the dug up corpses.

18:32.649 --> 18:33.638
Really.

18:34.129 --> 18:38.759
Don't worry, we won't tell a soul
about you being witches and all.

18:38.929 --> 18:42.683
- Our little secret.
- That's good to know.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.562
- Something the matter?
- It's just...

18:45.729 --> 18:48.084
What kind of tea is this?
It's different.

18:48.289 --> 18:49.802
It's a special blend.

18:49.969 --> 18:52.927
Listen, maybe you
had better get going

18:53.129 --> 18:55.962
to start to look for whoever
might be trying to summon Kryto.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.127
- Gail...
- Two of the corpses were found

18:59.289 --> 19:02.247
in that old furniture warehouse
out on Route 10.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.525
- Weren't they, Helen?
- Yes. I think so.

19:04.929 --> 19:08.558
- That's not really a lot to go on.
- Well, you have to start somewhere.

19:08.729 --> 19:14.247
You just go up Route 10, and then turn
up Willow and it will be right there.

19:15.809 --> 19:18.926
Okay, so I guess we'll be back later.

19:19.089 --> 19:20.761
Yeah, we'll be here.

19:22.409 --> 19:25.003
Kryto said they weren't
supposed to leave.

19:25.209 --> 19:26.801
I know, but they
were getting suspicious.

19:26.969 --> 19:28.925
Are you sure you're not trying
to protect them?

19:29.129 --> 19:30.608
Of course I'm trying to protect them.

19:30.809 --> 19:32.720
I feel bad enough
about stealing their powers.

19:32.929 --> 19:36.558
But they're family, and no demon
is going to hurt them.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.525
Come on.

19:41.689 --> 19:46.763
We just have to keep calling for their
powers until the potion takes effect.

20:04.049 --> 20:05.801
You guys see anything?

20:05.969 --> 20:07.448
Are you sure this is the right place?

20:07.609 --> 20:09.918
Don't look at me,
I didn't navigate this time.

20:10.089 --> 20:12.239
Are either of you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:12.449 --> 20:14.201
Wild goose chase?

20:14.369 --> 20:16.519
Why would Aunt Gail send us
out here for no reason?

20:16.729 --> 20:19.926
I don't know, but she seemed
in an awful hurry to get us out of...

20:21.569 --> 20:23.127
You okay?

20:23.289 --> 20:26.964
No, I'm kind of feeling
light-headed all of a sudden.

20:27.489 --> 20:30.128
I'm not feeling so hot
myself right now.

20:31.849 --> 20:37.003
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

20:37.169 --> 20:42.163
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

20:42.329 --> 20:43.842
It's not working.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.523
- It will.
- It better.

20:46.689 --> 20:52.002
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

20:52.169 --> 20:57.482
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

20:57.649 --> 21:02.928
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

21:03.089 --> 21:09.164
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

21:21.529 --> 21:25.158
Time for you to hold up
your end of the bargain.

21:37.249 --> 21:39.399
Oh, my God, Gail.

21:39.569 --> 21:41.082
It worked.

21:50.369 --> 21:52.360
Now, us.

21:52.809 --> 21:55.403
- It's our turn.
- Yes, it is.

21:57.929 --> 21:59.806
What are you doing?

22:02.889 --> 22:06.768
You see, I can take youth away
as quickly as I can grant it.

22:08.329 --> 22:09.648
But why?

22:09.849 --> 22:12.488
It takes three witches to summon me,
and three to banish me.

22:12.649 --> 22:14.048
You do the math.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.359
I wanted more powers
to protect myself.

22:16.529 --> 22:21.239
Now, I want you to introduce me
to other willing souls

22:21.449 --> 22:22.848
who want to be young again,

22:23.049 --> 22:25.768
unless you care to end up
like your friends.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.358
Beauty has its price.

22:55.289 --> 22:57.245
- Aunt Gail?
- Anybody home?

22:57.409 --> 23:00.048
I don't understand
what the hell is going on.

23:00.209 --> 23:02.643
- I told you something wasn't right.
- Well, what's not right

23:02.809 --> 23:05.607
is I have a feeling it's Gail and her
friends who summoned this demon.

23:05.769 --> 23:07.521
If that were true,
why would Aunt Gail

23:07.689 --> 23:10.157
want us to come to Santa Costa?

23:13.209 --> 23:16.440
- It stinks.
- This is what I'm saying.

23:18.249 --> 23:21.002
I think it's coming from here.

23:25.449 --> 23:27.883
What is that smell?

23:28.369 --> 23:30.246
Wait a minute.

23:30.929 --> 23:32.965
What are those?

23:33.609 --> 23:35.679
Oh, I would say
by the looks of things,

23:35.849 --> 23:39.728
that's Amanda
and that would be Helen.

23:39.929 --> 23:42.204
Oh, God.

23:42.409 --> 23:44.445
I hope that didn't happen
from drinking the tea.

23:44.649 --> 23:47.038
No, that must have happened
when they tried to summon Kryto.

23:47.209 --> 23:50.963
Although, I don't see Aunt Gail here.
That's a good sign, I hope.

23:56.249 --> 23:57.967
- What's the matter?
- I don't know,

23:58.129 --> 24:00.563
- but I can't freeze the rat thing.
- What?

24:00.769 --> 24:03.158
You try. Move it.

24:04.129 --> 24:08.202
Okay, what the hell
is going on with our powers?

24:11.209 --> 24:13.769
Maybe we ought to ask Aunt Gail.

24:23.569 --> 24:26.766
Well, they were definitely making
a potion in there. A serious one too.

24:26.929 --> 24:29.124
- Hemlock root.
- No wonder the tea tasted funny.

24:29.289 --> 24:32.201
- How did we let her do this to us?
- I guess we trusted her.

24:32.409 --> 24:34.843
Yeah, well, she just got crossed off
my Christmas list.

24:35.049 --> 24:37.688
Aunt Gail was Gram's best friend.
She used to bake us cookies.

24:37.889 --> 24:39.163
And now she's spiking our tea.

24:39.369 --> 24:41.246
But why? Just to be young again?

24:41.769 --> 24:44.283
I mean she had to know she'd be
giving up her soul in exchange.

24:44.769 --> 24:48.079
Maybe it wasn't just for youth.
Maybe it was for health.

24:48.249 --> 24:50.558
These are all doctor bills,
recent ones.

24:51.049 --> 24:55.042
Radiation treatments, chemotherapy.
I don't think she had very long to live.

24:55.689 --> 24:58.601
That still doesn't excuse
what she did.

24:59.009 --> 25:00.920
What she did to us.

25:01.089 --> 25:03.683
I mean, you can't use magic
to save yourself.

25:04.089 --> 25:05.681
No, not without consequences.

25:05.849 --> 25:07.885
And there's no bigger one
than giving up your soul.

25:08.089 --> 25:11.047
I just don't understand.
Why steal our powers?

25:11.209 --> 25:13.040
Kryto must've wanted more
out of the bargain,

25:13.209 --> 25:15.769
and Aunt Gail was desperate
enough to give it to him.

25:15.969 --> 25:17.482
We shouldn't have
left her alone in the attic.

25:17.689 --> 25:19.202
Okay, well, we have the potion.

25:19.409 --> 25:23.038
If we can find the spell, then we should
be able to transfer our powers back.

25:23.249 --> 25:25.479
You kidding? We won't be able
to get anywhere near him.

25:25.689 --> 25:26.883
Well, he has our powers,

25:27.049 --> 25:30.439
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he knows how to use them.

25:31.049 --> 25:33.483
Besides, do you have a better idea?

25:34.049 --> 25:36.517
Go home and call it a day?

25:36.689 --> 25:38.884
Funny, come on.

25:51.449 --> 25:54.521
See? You're not the only one, Gail.

25:54.689 --> 25:57.442
Everybody wants to be young
and attractive.

25:57.609 --> 26:00.760
The difference is I knew what
I was giving up. They don't.

26:00.969 --> 26:03.483
Oh, they will, one day.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.526
Their last.

26:07.689 --> 26:09.839
Do you know that one?

26:10.009 --> 26:11.727
- Introduce me.
- No.

26:11.929 --> 26:15.046
Tired of being young again already?

26:29.449 --> 26:31.963
Hiya, toots.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.561
Wait a minute.

26:35.729 --> 26:38.607
Tell me those aren't the same guys
you asked for directions.

26:38.769 --> 26:42.045
Okay, Kryto's close. Let's drive.

26:43.009 --> 26:45.523
The only catch is that
you have to keep it a secret.

26:45.969 --> 26:47.925
You can't ever tell a soul.

26:48.329 --> 26:51.082
I'm sure you understand why.

26:51.249 --> 26:53.240
What, is this some kind of a joke?

26:53.449 --> 26:56.680
If you think it is,
then why are you still here?

26:56.889 --> 26:59.244
Because some part of you
is hoping beyond hope

26:59.409 --> 27:02.401
that I just might be telling
you the truth,

27:02.569 --> 27:04.958
that I can restore your youth.

27:05.649 --> 27:07.367
Just like I did for...

27:09.529 --> 27:11.247
...Gail Altman.

27:15.129 --> 27:16.926
Gail?

27:17.089 --> 27:20.798
Yes, Frank, it's really me.

27:42.289 --> 27:43.438
You forgot your...

27:51.249 --> 27:53.558
- What?
- Three witches.

27:54.009 --> 27:55.328
You said you took care of them.

27:55.529 --> 27:57.884
- What are you talking about?
- You lied to me.

27:59.609 --> 28:01.918
Girls, run, hurry!

28:02.769 --> 28:04.805
Aunt Gail?

28:06.409 --> 28:08.843
So much for him not knowing
how to use our powers.

28:10.369 --> 28:12.963
I've got one power he doesn't have.

28:15.369 --> 28:17.041
- Phoebe.
- No, no, no. Okay, wait.

28:17.209 --> 28:20.406
- It's just way too dangerous.
- Nobody's sending me back again.

28:20.609 --> 28:23.077
- We can't just sit here.
- No, we have to think.

28:23.249 --> 28:25.922
All right, what do we know about
our powers that he doesn't?

28:26.609 --> 28:29.885
- Thank God.
- Stay away from me.

28:32.969 --> 28:34.925
All right, Phoebe's thinking
what we're thinking.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.398
Great, what are we thinking?

28:38.289 --> 28:40.598
You can't hide from me.

28:40.809 --> 28:42.561
I didn't want to die.

28:42.729 --> 28:44.082
I was wrong.

28:44.769 --> 28:46.999
Here. You'll need this.

28:49.689 --> 28:51.486
The spell.

28:53.969 --> 28:55.527
Just follow my lead. You ready?

28:56.009 --> 28:59.046
- All right, we give up.
- Excuse me?

29:00.849 --> 29:02.805
No, no, no, Phoebe, wait.
He'll freeze us.

29:07.169 --> 29:09.444
That's a marvellous power.

29:12.049 --> 29:15.678
Good witches don't freeze.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.362
- I'll kill you.
- No!

29:26.289 --> 29:28.007
Okay, what do we do
about Aunt Gail?

29:28.169 --> 29:30.637
Well, without our powers,
there's not too much that we can do.

29:30.809 --> 29:32.765
Okay, so we have to get back
our powers,

29:32.929 --> 29:34.601
and then find Kryto
before he finds us.

29:34.769 --> 29:37.363
Agreed. All right, let's go.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.520
Piper, come on.

29:41.009 --> 29:42.442
Piper, what's the matter?

29:42.609 --> 29:44.008
- I've had it.
- What do you mean?

29:44.169 --> 29:47.320
- You've had it with what?
- With being a witch.

29:52.809 --> 29:54.959
You betrayed me.

29:55.129 --> 30:00.157
At least they got away
so they can destroy you.

30:00.369 --> 30:01.882
No, they won't.

30:02.049 --> 30:04.005
I know where they're going,
remember?

30:04.169 --> 30:06.205
I saw it.

30:07.129 --> 30:09.438
No!

30:19.969 --> 30:22.529
- We can't just leave your car.
- We'll call a cab.

30:22.689 --> 30:25.044
- That'll cost 100 bucks.
- I'm not going back to town.

30:25.209 --> 30:27.359
- I'm through with demon hunting.
- Piper, come on.

30:27.529 --> 30:29.406
There's really nothing more to say.

30:29.569 --> 30:32.641
Well, if it's getting back our powers
you're worried about, I can do that.

30:32.809 --> 30:35.642
- I have a spell that can do that.
- I don't want my powers back.

30:35.809 --> 30:37.447
- You don't mean that.
- Don't I?

30:37.609 --> 30:39.645
I think it may be the solution
to all my problems.

30:39.809 --> 30:41.208
Piper, wait a second.

30:41.409 --> 30:44.128
I know exactly
what you're going through.

30:45.249 --> 30:46.967
Remember when Andy died?

30:47.129 --> 30:49.324
I didn't want to be a witch
anymore either.

30:49.489 --> 30:51.320
- This is different.
- How?

30:51.529 --> 30:54.043
Not wanting to be a witch isn't
a symptom of something else

30:54.209 --> 30:56.325
like it is for you, Prue.
For me, it's the problem.

30:56.489 --> 30:58.445
It's the cause.
It's the problem with everything.

30:58.609 --> 31:01.123
I want a life that doesn't
have a lot of death in it.

31:01.289 --> 31:02.961
I don't think that's too much to ask.

31:05.209 --> 31:07.040
You can't do this.

31:07.209 --> 31:10.281
Phoebe, we're all gonna do it,
sooner or later.

31:10.449 --> 31:12.440
I'm just doing it first.

31:26.129 --> 31:27.403
What are you doing?

31:27.569 --> 31:30.641
Piper, you can't do this.
It affects all of us.

31:30.809 --> 31:33.926
Phoebe, I love you. You're one
of my two most favourite sisters,

31:34.089 --> 31:35.886
but I don't wanna give up
having a life.

31:36.089 --> 31:38.000
- I'm not asking you to.
- Yes, you are,

31:38.169 --> 31:39.522
just by asking me to be a witch.

31:39.729 --> 31:43.005
Piper, you were born a witch.
It's not a choice. It's a fact.

31:43.209 --> 31:45.882
Says who? Up until two years ago,
I didn't know I was born a witch.

31:46.089 --> 31:49.206
Neither did you guys.
And we were perfectly happy then.

31:49.409 --> 31:51.604
With perfectly normal lives.
I miss that, don't you?

31:51.809 --> 31:53.481
- No.
- Yeah.

31:54.649 --> 31:56.321
Well, sometimes.

31:56.489 --> 31:59.128
But I've accepted the fact
that I can't just turn back the clock

31:59.289 --> 32:01.245
and pretend it never happened.
And neither can you.

32:01.649 --> 32:05.528
I just... I don't wanna end up
like Aunt Gail, old and alone,

32:06.049 --> 32:07.243
and wishing I was young again

32:07.409 --> 32:09.718
so I could do all the things
I missed out on.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.567
We won't let that happen to you.

32:14.969 --> 32:17.324
Just help us get our powers back.

32:17.489 --> 32:18.922
Please?

32:19.089 --> 32:20.442
We can't do it without you.

32:20.609 --> 32:23.601
- We won't do it without you.
- No.

32:33.089 --> 32:35.080
How do we know Kryto
will even come here?

32:35.249 --> 32:37.046
If he's gonna look for us,
he'll start here.

32:37.249 --> 32:39.558
We could try summoning him
like Gail and her friends did.

32:39.769 --> 32:42.283
I think that only works
with spirits, Pheebs.

32:42.449 --> 32:45.566
I still don't understand how we can get
him to drink this without our powers.

32:45.769 --> 32:49.159
We have to get him to use a power
he doesn't know how to use yet.

32:49.449 --> 32:50.928
- Astral projection?
- Exactly.

32:51.089 --> 32:53.239
If we can distract him long enough
to be in two places...

32:53.449 --> 32:56.964
We might be able to trick him into
thinking I'm still looking for the potion.

32:57.129 --> 32:58.608
I'm only doing this for you guys.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.408
If I get killed, I'm gonna haunt
the both of you forever.

33:01.609 --> 33:04.282
- Yeah, yeah. Got the spell?
- Yes.

33:05.169 --> 33:07.046
I got it.

33:07.969 --> 33:12.804
Anybody home? I know you're here
and I know where you are.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.359
Phoebe, get the potion.

33:33.209 --> 33:34.847
No!

33:44.089 --> 33:45.886
I got it.

33:46.049 --> 33:47.323
Come on, come on.

33:47.529 --> 33:49.963
- Pheebs, get the potion.
- Start chanting the spell.

33:50.169 --> 33:52.046
- We need the potion first.
- It won't work.

33:52.249 --> 33:54.843
Just start. I've got a plan.

33:55.769 --> 33:59.364
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

33:59.529 --> 34:01.645
Come to us...

34:02.809 --> 34:04.162
- Get the potion.
- All right.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.482
Pretty nifty power, huh?

34:13.609 --> 34:15.725
Do it!

34:15.929 --> 34:17.726
Give him all of it.

34:22.009 --> 34:23.886
He's coming back.

34:32.168 --> 34:35.161
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

34:35.369 --> 34:38.998
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

34:46.728 --> 34:49.527
Wanna see what does freeze?

34:50.248 --> 34:51.237
Pheebs.

34:51.409 --> 34:52.728
What witch has done
And then undone

34:53.208 --> 34:56.884
Return this spirit back within
And separate him from his skin

35:12.289 --> 35:14.519
- Ouch.
- That looked like it hurt.

35:14.729 --> 35:16.879
Yeah, well, I hope so
for Aunt Gail's sake.

35:17.089 --> 35:19.523
And Helen and Amanda.

35:36.249 --> 35:37.523
Very nice.

35:37.689 --> 35:40.522
Well, we thought that you might
appreciate a pair without demon blood.

35:40.729 --> 35:42.765
I do, very much. Thank you.

35:42.969 --> 35:45.244
So, Piper...

35:46.369 --> 35:47.927
...Phoebe and I were
kind of wondering...

35:48.249 --> 35:50.809
- Because we want you to be happy.
- Very happy.

35:51.009 --> 35:53.443
So we were wondering

35:53.609 --> 35:56.760
if we should be budgeting
for more shoes or not.

35:58.529 --> 36:00.884
Well, I wish I could tell you
getting my powers back

36:01.049 --> 36:03.279
made me appreciate what I lost.

36:03.849 --> 36:05.202
But...

36:05.569 --> 36:07.400
But I feel like I'm back
where I started.

36:07.569 --> 36:09.958
I mean, I understand what you guys
are saying and everything,

36:10.129 --> 36:13.246
but I can't change the way I feel.

36:16.089 --> 36:18.478
So you really are quitting?

36:18.969 --> 36:21.722
I want to for all the reasons
we already talked about.

36:21.889 --> 36:27.566
But I'm only gonna do that
if and when you guys want to also.

36:29.769 --> 36:31.885
Well, I'm always gonna
wanna be a witch.

36:32.449 --> 36:34.360
- That's for sure.
- She's young.

36:34.809 --> 36:36.959
Oh, give me a break.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.043
- All right, I gotta go.
- Good luck.

36:40.209 --> 36:42.245
Thanks.

36:45.329 --> 36:47.160
Poor Dan.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.484
So do you think we should worry?

36:50.649 --> 36:55.325
- No, he'll be all right.
- I mean about Piper quitting.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.640
Maybe, a little.

37:05.409 --> 37:07.081
You little liar.

37:07.249 --> 37:08.762
You did go see the optometrist.

37:08.969 --> 37:11.199
Yeah, well...

37:11.849 --> 37:16.001
...let's just say I'm not as concerned
with my vanity anymore.

37:40.169 --> 37:42.046
You hungry?

37:42.849 --> 37:46.524
- No, unless you are.
- No, I'm fine.

37:50.089 --> 37:52.125
What?

37:52.849 --> 37:56.046
I was thinking that it
just seems like yesterday

37:56.209 --> 37:59.645
you moved in next door,
and we, you know...

38:00.089 --> 38:03.240
Piper, you don't have to do this.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.959
- Do what?
- Go through this big explanation.

38:07.689 --> 38:10.726
I think I know what you wanted
to talk to me about.

38:13.329 --> 38:15.923
You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

38:16.929 --> 38:18.999
Is it because of Leo?

38:20.009 --> 38:21.806
I'm sorry.

38:23.569 --> 38:26.163
It's really none of my business.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.247
Dan, I will always love you.
This doesn't change that.

38:33.409 --> 38:38.483
You've been really good to me
and treated me incredibly well.

38:40.969 --> 38:42.561
But...

38:43.089 --> 38:46.240
...I need to try and make
this work with Leo.

38:46.409 --> 38:47.922
And it may not, I don't know.

38:48.089 --> 38:49.602
But...

38:50.049 --> 38:52.643
...we've never really given it a shot.

38:52.809 --> 38:55.528
And I want to.

38:56.369 --> 38:57.802
I have to.

39:01.969 --> 39:04.358
I'm so sorry.

39:05.449 --> 39:08.964
You don't have to be.
You're just being honest with me.

39:11.489 --> 39:14.083
We're still gonna be
neighbours though, right?

39:14.249 --> 39:16.365
We'd better be more than that.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.167
Well, I guess I better go.
