00:15.015 --> 00:17.552
(police car siren wailing)

00:17.552 --> 00:19.453
- [Jenny] How can there be a God

00:19.453 --> 00:20.722
when my life started out the way

00:20.722 --> 00:21.555
that it did?

00:22.590 --> 00:27.595
Some things you'll never forget
like being born into slavery

00:28.730 --> 00:31.967
or knowing your mom was murdered
and it's because of you.

00:33.333 --> 00:37.372
I was born into child trafficking
and when it was my turn,

00:37.372 --> 00:39.640
my mom made a way of escape for me.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.745
That day was the worst day of my life.

00:43.745 --> 00:45.247
And I never forget.

00:54.922 --> 00:55.957
(door creaks shut)

00:55.957 --> 00:58.527
(upbeat music)

00:59.827 --> 01:02.830
- Jenny I didn't know you liked
the Italian culture so much.

01:04.765 --> 01:09.503
- I mean, I didn't
before, but I don't know,

01:09.503 --> 01:14.242
it was before I met you
and it's growing on me.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.477
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.552
- Guess who?
- Oh my God.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.888
Oh my God, you scared me.

01:26.888 --> 01:28.790
Hey.
- How are you?

01:28.790 --> 01:29.957
- Good.
- That's good.

01:41.803 --> 01:44.572
- Hey, that's my favorite dress!

01:44.572 --> 01:45.640
- Really?

01:45.640 --> 01:47.875
I mean, it's like you're so popular

01:47.875 --> 01:52.880
so why would a guy like you
wanna be with a girl like me?

01:56.683 --> 01:58.520
- Exactly that reason.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.223
- Jenny, I feel like you're the first girl

02:03.223 --> 02:04.592
who's ever understood me.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.497
- You're the first guy
too but I don't know,

02:09.497 --> 02:10.998
I can't take advantage of you.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.802
- What?

02:13.802 --> 02:17.105
- 'Cause you're just with me
because you feel sorry for me.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.040
- Of course not.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.087
- Jenny, please don't do this.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.492
- It's not you, it's really just me.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.368
You deserve so much better.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.502
- All I want is you.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.607
- But I want someone else
for you, someone better.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.245
- Jenny, where's this coming from?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.383
I thought you were my girl.

03:03.852 --> 03:06.353
I even stopped seeing my
counselor when I met you.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.125
I'll fight for you.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.130
I know I'm not the best at
expressing my emotions sometimes

03:16.130 --> 03:19.567
and I don't say I love
you as much as I need to,

03:19.567 --> 03:21.868
but you're my girl.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.138
Please don't do this.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.278
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

03:37.152 --> 03:40.153
(cellphone ringing)

03:42.990 --> 03:43.825
Hello?

03:45.827 --> 03:48.162
- Hey, are you coming

03:48.162 --> 03:49.430
to the auditions today?

03:50.532 --> 03:52.567
- Yeah, of course.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.370
Why wouldn't I be?

03:55.370 --> 03:57.672
- No, I'm just making sure.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.877
Are you doing alright?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.280
- Yeah, I'm good.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.282
- Okay, I'll see you later.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.655
So how was your date?

04:14.622 --> 04:17.958
- Basic, can we just get to the auditions?

04:17.958 --> 04:21.595
- Yeah, did Diane tell you
that the foster home called

04:21.595 --> 04:22.430
and they said they were gonna pay

04:22.430 --> 04:26.000
for your college?
- I'm not going to college.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.168
We already talked about this.

04:28.168 --> 04:31.805
- Okay whatever, it's your decision.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.443
- So, who's this guy I'm auditioning for?

04:35.443 --> 04:36.643
- I meant to tell you.

04:36.643 --> 04:37.712
He's an intern.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.547
Caleb, he's a good friend.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.117
He goes to the college that
I was telling you about.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.218
Did I say something?

04:46.187 --> 04:48.288
No, I didn't.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.125
- Well, "this good friend" is late.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.193
- No, he's not.

04:52.193 --> 04:53.962
12:29 on the dot.

04:53.962 --> 04:56.163
- Caleb.
- How's it going Moses?

04:57.965 --> 04:58.900
- You guys give me a moment.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.468
I need to go and handle
this so I'll be right back.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.645
- Hi, where would you
like for me to start?

05:10.645 --> 05:13.147
- Actually, let's start with this.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.115
Tell me something about yourself.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.052
- I'd rather not.

05:17.052 --> 05:19.620
Can we just get to this?

05:19.620 --> 05:22.623
- I'd rather not.
- Okay, whatever.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.963
I am Jenny and I really dislike guys

05:28.963 --> 05:32.733
who try to hit on girls
when they should be working.

05:33.935 --> 05:36.070
- Trust me, if I was hitting on you,

05:36.070 --> 05:37.572
you'd be falling by now.

05:37.572 --> 05:39.273
I'm just following instructions.

05:43.745 --> 05:47.582
- I like to act, sometimes write.

05:47.582 --> 05:50.250
- Write?
- Hardly.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.120
- Any college plans?

05:52.120 --> 05:53.520
- No.
- Why not?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.757
You're scared you won't get in.

05:55.757 --> 05:57.292
- No.

05:57.292 --> 05:59.227
- You're afraid they won't get you.

05:59.227 --> 06:01.195
- Is that still in your manual?

06:02.497 --> 06:03.330
- Every word.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.972
- So how's it going?

06:12.707 --> 06:15.810
- It's going and so am I.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.247
- Whoa, whoa, what happened?

06:19.247 --> 06:21.048
- I was just following instructions.

06:23.785 --> 06:26.520
(door slams shut)

06:26.520 --> 06:29.090
(upbeat music)

06:30.725 --> 06:33.393
(phone ringing)

06:36.097 --> 06:39.167
- Hello?
- Hey Diane, what's going on?

06:39.167 --> 06:40.835
- Can you believe it?

06:40.835 --> 06:43.070
The lady from the foster home, she called

06:43.070 --> 06:47.942
and said since Jenny was
or is literally over 18,

06:49.377 --> 06:53.213
that I could actually
kick her out of my home.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.218
And that made me really, really mad.

06:57.218 --> 07:01.622
Just think about it,
what if Jenny ever hears

07:01.622 --> 07:03.723
or overheard that conversation?

07:03.723 --> 07:05.527
What do you think she would think of me?

07:05.527 --> 07:08.562
- It's okay Diane, it's okay.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.065
Jenny knows that you love her.

07:37.692 --> 07:38.893
- Hello?

07:38.893 --> 07:42.730
- Hey Jenny, I just wanted to apologize

07:42.730 --> 07:45.398
about Caleb and college.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.572
I didn't mean to over step my boundaries.

07:50.572 --> 07:53.740
- Actually, I've had a change of mind.

07:55.710 --> 07:57.010
- Yeah?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.580
(upbeat music)

08:32.880 --> 08:36.450
I know it's not much, but
I bounced a few apartments,

08:36.450 --> 08:39.187
but this one is available
for you to stay for the year.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.058
There's not much to it,
but it's a safe space.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.795
- Thanks.
- Of course.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.365
- [Jenny] I appreciate it.

08:54.002 --> 08:55.903
Is that the last of the bags?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.472
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.285
- This fell off when we were unloading.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.157
- My sixth grade journal.

09:16.157 --> 09:17.958
- Maybe you could write in it again?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.730
- Yeah, like what?

09:24.432 --> 09:29.437
Death, heartbreak, revenge?

09:33.640 --> 09:38.645
- Yeah, well, I'll be gone then.

09:41.482 --> 09:43.917
If you need anything, just call.

09:45.620 --> 09:46.453
- Yep.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.253
(keyboard keys clicking)

11:21.582 --> 11:24.518
- Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,

11:24.518 --> 11:26.487
are you actually asleep in the library?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.790
You know libraries are meant for studying.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.792
Dorm rooms are meant for sleeping.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.060
And it's not like finals week,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.695
it's actually like the reverse.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.237
- You know, I don't actually
know what you're doing here

11:43.237 --> 11:46.573
because libraries are actually
meant for smart people

11:47.708 --> 11:49.743
and well, not the reverse.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.613
- Well, you should have given
me a call when you made it.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.117
I could've given you a tour,

11:56.117 --> 11:57.952
taken you out for lunch or something.

11:59.353 --> 12:00.187
- I didn't realize I was one

12:00.187 --> 12:02.757
of the people you considered
so highly of in your books.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.993
- You're not, but I do a good
job at loving my enemies.

12:08.362 --> 12:09.197
- So do I.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.398
So here's my number.

12:14.535 --> 12:15.368
- You know what?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.203
I don't need it.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.505
I still have it from the last
acting job you auditioned for.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.940
The one you didn't make.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.212
- Well, well, well, what
do we have here huh?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.450
Oh, you're the freshman
girl who wants to try out

12:30.450 --> 12:32.753
for the show aren't you?

12:34.020 --> 12:37.290
The answer is no because
there's only one part left

12:38.392 --> 12:41.962
and the most important
part and it's going to me.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.498
- All right.
- Sarah stop.

12:46.833 --> 12:50.070
So I see you've met Caleb, my boyfriend.

12:50.070 --> 12:50.905
- Ex.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.007
- He likes to tell himself that.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.545
It's too bad you're not trying
out for the writing team.

12:57.545 --> 12:59.513
Caleb could have really helped you out.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.550
How do you two know each other anyways?

13:05.987 --> 13:08.255
- We don't, and if you don't mind,

13:08.255 --> 13:11.225
I have some studying and
preparation to do, so.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.863
You too have a good one.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.800
(heart beating)

13:24.838 --> 13:27.575
(Jenny laughing)

13:37.017 --> 13:38.218
(knock on door)

13:38.218 --> 13:41.322
Come in.
(door creaks open)

13:43.523 --> 13:46.427
(door creaks shut)

13:48.695 --> 13:51.365
- Hey Jenny, are you okay?

13:51.365 --> 13:53.300
- Hmm mmh, any word from mom?

13:57.738 --> 13:59.373
- You're gonna be strong right?

13:59.373 --> 14:00.707
Can you come closer please?

14:02.308 --> 14:03.143
Just look at me.

14:04.845 --> 14:09.750
The officer just called
and I'm sorry (sobbing).

14:11.285 --> 14:15.288
- No, no (sobbing)!
- It's okay.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.352
(upbeat music)

15:24.190 --> 15:27.393
- You always, always do this.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.330
You're not listening to me, listen.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.598
I've literally been
wanting to talk to you,

15:31.598 --> 15:32.700
but you don't wanna listen.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.067
I've literally been wanting to talk to you

15:34.067 --> 15:37.705
for seven years, but
you don't wanna listen.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.877
Stop right there.

15:42.877 --> 15:43.710
I can't do this.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.178
That's it, it's over, I'm done.

15:54.588 --> 15:55.822
It's so hard.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.225
You know what?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.560
I can't do this.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.393
I can't do this.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.595
That's it, it's over, I'm done.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.098
I'm going to the writing center.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.838
(upbeat music)

16:21.382 --> 16:25.218
(elevator bell dings)

16:25.218 --> 16:27.955
- Bradley, how you been?
- What's good, what's good?

16:27.955 --> 16:29.957
I know.
- What you been up to?

16:29.957 --> 16:31.325
- I've been just waiting for
the semester to start again,

16:31.325 --> 16:32.625
get back to the groove of things you know?

16:32.625 --> 16:33.827
- I feel that.
- But hey, I've been working

16:33.827 --> 16:35.928
on a script though.
- Really?

16:35.928 --> 16:36.763
- This character's in my head.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.765
I've been-
- I would really

16:37.765 --> 16:39.265
wanna hear out you right
now, I just have to go

16:39.265 --> 16:40.667
to the counseling sessions.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.002
- Counseling?
- Yeah.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.805
- Okay Dr. Caleb fixing lives again.

16:44.805 --> 16:46.173
- I'm putting that major into work.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.408
- Oh good, that's what's up.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.843
- But, I don't know man,

16:49.843 --> 16:52.012
ever since this new Jenny
girl came into town,

16:52.012 --> 16:54.080
all my clients have just
been complaining about her.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.582
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.683
- When did she move here?

16:56.683 --> 16:59.185
- I don't know, but it feels
like she was born here.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.688
- Who's Jenny?
- Doesn't even matter,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.257
but I'll see you later.

17:03.257 --> 17:05.558
I'm gonna go to counseling.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.060
Alright. Work on the script.
- I will.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.595
I'll let you know.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.165
(upbeat music)

18:04.685 --> 18:06.953
- [Jenny] I used to write with my mom,

18:06.953 --> 18:10.123
but I haven't been able
to do that since she died.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.303
So I just spend all my time learning

18:23.303 --> 18:26.373
how to write, knowing I will never do it.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.247
(Jenny sighs)

20:24.625 --> 20:27.227
(upbeat music)

20:35.102 --> 20:36.603
- Hi, my name is Caleb.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.537
How can I help you today?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.740
- My girlfriend just broke up with me.

20:39.740 --> 20:40.673
- Her name's Jenny?

20:41.642 --> 20:42.875
- What are you, psychic?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.078
- You do know your worth is
not defined by how a girl

20:45.078 --> 20:46.613
or people treat you right?

20:46.613 --> 20:49.415
- I know, but if feels like it.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.485
- And what was her name again?

20:51.485 --> 20:55.155
- Jenny, Jenny Jenkins, my first love.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.125
- Sorry, I just need a minute.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.568
- Let me guess, your
girlfriend broke up with you.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.403
Her name is Jenny.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.372
She made you feel amazing.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.407
And now, you have no idea
where things went wrong

21:14.407 --> 21:16.142
and you're finding it
hard to focus in school

21:16.142 --> 21:17.577
because depression kicked in?

21:18.645 --> 21:20.813
And now it's making you feel worthless.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.650
- Oh, so you've been
reading my Instagram posts?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.618
- So um, how are you doing today?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.487
- I'm depressed.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.855
I'm trying to be my regular self

21:28.855 --> 21:31.123
and I need to focus on other things,

21:31.123 --> 21:36.128
but you just don't forget
something like that.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.833
- Do you think you'll ever
find a girl like her again?

21:39.833 --> 21:43.070
- I don't think that
there's anyone like her.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.572
- What was your name again?

21:45.572 --> 21:48.408
Oh, Drake, that's funny.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.410
You're so in my feelings right now.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.912
- What?

21:51.912 --> 21:55.082
- Caleb, be a good counselor.

21:55.082 --> 21:58.152
Sorry, what I'm meaning to
say is you know your worth

21:58.152 --> 22:01.120
is not defined by how people
or a girl treats you, right?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.023
- Yeah, I know

22:03.023 --> 22:08.028
It's just, wait, what did you say again?

22:08.862 --> 22:10.930
Did you say people or a girl?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.365
Like a girl is not a person?

22:12.365 --> 22:13.500
What is she, an alien?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.333
- Come again?

22:16.403 --> 22:21.408
- She is, oh my goodness, what
if Jenny truly is a goddess,

22:21.642 --> 22:24.043
or a mermaid, or even better, an alien?

22:27.247 --> 22:30.317
- Sir, have you seen the
school psychiatric doctor?

22:30.317 --> 22:32.618
- Thanks man, that helps a lot.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.653
See you next week

22:35.255 --> 22:38.525
(Caleb sighs deeply)

22:38.525 --> 22:41.360
(mid tempo music)

22:47.200 --> 22:50.203
(cellphone ringing)

22:54.007 --> 22:55.108
Hello?

22:55.108 --> 22:58.010
- [Caleb] Hey, it's Caleb.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.113
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.482
How about you let me make it up to you?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.117
Can I take you out?

23:04.117 --> 23:06.587
- I don't need your charity so no.

23:15.195 --> 23:18.198
(cellphone ringing)

23:23.570 --> 23:24.772
- What?

23:24.772 --> 23:26.573
- [Caleb] My conscience
has been eating me up

23:26.573 --> 23:27.807
over the last few days

23:27.807 --> 23:31.445
because of my unlawful conduct
upon an innocent civilian.

23:31.445 --> 23:32.645
- You are so weird.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.915
- [Caleb] Maybe, I'm
just trying to say sorry

23:34.915 --> 23:36.483
for the other day.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.952
- And why do you care all of a sudden?

23:40.320 --> 23:44.057
- Who said I didn't before?

23:44.057 --> 23:49.062
- Okay, whatever, I'll see you for lunch

23:49.728 --> 23:51.397
or dinner, whatever.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.892
(elevator bell dings)

24:20.693 --> 24:23.263
(upbeat music)

25:14.280 --> 25:18.685
If I was gonna do this,
I needed to be ready.

25:20.287 --> 25:24.057
Time for my secret weapon, love poems.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.093
Lots and lots of them.

25:28.662 --> 25:31.330
(upbeat music)

26:36.262 --> 26:39.165
"Let me not to the marriage of true mind.

26:39.165 --> 26:43.737
"Admit impediment, love is not love.

26:43.737 --> 26:46.807
"Which alters when it alteration finds,

26:46.807 --> 26:49.175
"or bends with the remover to remove.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.278
"O no! it is an ever-fixed mark

26:52.278 --> 26:55.548
"that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

26:55.548 --> 26:58.885
"It is the star to every wandering bark.

26:58.885 --> 27:02.822
"Whose worth's unknown,
although his height be taken.

27:02.822 --> 27:06.727
"Love's not time's fool,
though rosy lips and cheeks

27:06.727 --> 27:09.395
"Within his bending sickle's compass come.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.397
"Love alters not.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.832
"You say you love the sun,

27:12.832 --> 27:14.833
"but you find a shadow spot.

27:14.833 --> 27:18.938
"You say you love wind,
but you close your windows.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.842
"This is why I am afraid

27:22.708 --> 27:25.545
"when you say you love me.

27:25.545 --> 27:27.980
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.852
"Thou art more lovely and more temperate

27:31.852 --> 27:34.853
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May

27:34.853 --> 27:38.223
"And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.495
"Doubt that the sun doth move

27:42.495 --> 27:47.500
"Doubt truth be a liar, but
never doubt that I love."

28:56.168 --> 28:58.772
(upbeat music)

29:31.070 --> 29:34.407
So, do you know what you're gonna order?

29:37.310 --> 29:40.313
- Not yet, but I know who
I'm gonna bring to order.

29:44.850 --> 29:45.852
- What?

29:45.852 --> 29:48.153
- I bet you plan on
breaking my heart too huh?

29:50.723 --> 29:54.027
- I don't know what you're talking about.

29:54.027 --> 29:56.095
- See Jenny, you think I brought you here

29:56.095 --> 29:59.865
'cause I like you, but honestly
that's far from the truth.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.368
I despise you.

30:03.368 --> 30:07.173
Okay granted, you're cute, funny.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.775
Let's disperse with the obvious.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.278
You're a savage.
- What?

30:13.747 --> 30:17.783
- See, my intern counseling
sessions used to be a breeze.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.452
I'd bring home the bacon.

30:19.452 --> 30:23.088
Big bucks for doing
nothing except my homework

30:23.088 --> 30:24.557
so I can party on the weekend.

30:24.557 --> 30:28.795
But ever since you came into
the picture, I have no life.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.502
- What an interesting story.

30:37.003 --> 30:37.903
And your point is?

30:39.038 --> 30:43.142
- My point is, is that
every story has a villain

30:43.142 --> 30:44.277
and that villain's you.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.982
But, every villain has a motive.

30:48.982 --> 30:50.283
And that's what I'm after.

30:51.885 --> 30:53.318
So why'd you do it?

30:59.225 --> 31:00.460
- I dunno what you're talking about.

31:00.460 --> 31:03.597
- (scoffs) Yes Jenny, you do.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.398
So tell me?

31:12.238 --> 31:14.673
- I have a no strings policy.

31:15.608 --> 31:16.642
- No strings?

31:17.577 --> 31:19.678
Well, just because you
don't feel attached,

31:19.678 --> 31:21.580
doesn't mean there aren't any strings.

31:22.582 --> 31:25.418
There are consequences to
all of our actions Jenny.

31:25.418 --> 31:27.053
- Really?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.222
Well, I haven't had any so far.

31:33.860 --> 31:35.328
- Unless I spill.

31:47.807 --> 31:48.808
- What you gonna do?

31:50.677 --> 31:53.512
Oh my God, breaking news.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.385
Not world hunger, or poverty, or suicide,

32:00.487 --> 32:02.755
but this girl called Jenny.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.463
I keep having guys fall for
the same girl, you know?

32:10.463 --> 32:12.065
So she must be a criminal.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.435
Let's expel her.

32:18.805 --> 32:21.373
(upbeat music)

32:22.942 --> 32:24.510
- That's stupid, I wouldn't say that.

32:24.510 --> 32:25.878
- No, you wouldn't.

32:30.817 --> 32:32.952
Play smart next time okay?

33:09.955 --> 33:12.458
- Bradley!
- Hey Caleb, what's up?

33:12.458 --> 33:15.093
- How's it going?
- I'm doing well.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.363
How are you doing?
- Good, just tired.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.265
- Yeah, I see.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.368
Hey, how'd it go last night?

33:22.368 --> 33:23.202
- Not very well.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.005
I mean, she admitted to it,
but I didn't get anything.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.740
- Oh, that's a bummer.

33:27.740 --> 33:32.345
- Yeah, it sucks what she's doing.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.113
It's horrible how she's playing these guys

33:35.113 --> 33:36.882
like it's some game.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.650
I just wish someone could show her.

33:39.552 --> 33:41.320
- Yeah, I agree.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.757
Somebody should show her how
much she's hurting these guys.

33:43.757 --> 33:44.757
It's not cool you know?

33:44.757 --> 33:49.762
- Yeah, yeah, Bradley you're a genius.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.298
I'll catch you later, okay?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.005
- Wow, that's real good.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.812
(door slams shut)

34:06.812 --> 34:09.715
- What are you doing here so early?

34:12.518 --> 34:17.523
- Because I couldn't wait to see you.

34:17.690 --> 34:19.925
- The feeling is absolutely not mutual.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.867
What, so you're gonna miss class now?

34:27.867 --> 34:29.935
- Class doesn't start for 45 minutes.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.405
(door slams shut)

34:33.405 --> 34:35.140
How did you even know my class?

34:37.710 --> 34:42.315
Literally, all I wanted was
to get some peace of mind.

34:42.315 --> 34:45.518
But no, here goes the stalker.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.653
- Do you really think you
can just get away with this?

34:49.788 --> 34:52.225
What kind of mental
satisfaction do you get out

34:52.225 --> 34:54.160
of breaking people's hearts?

34:54.160 --> 34:57.597
Fulfillment, joy, sexual gratification?

35:06.072 --> 35:08.942
- Yes, it does.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.345
You hit it on the nail.

35:13.913 --> 35:16.115
It's easy, boys are stupid.

35:18.217 --> 35:21.020
It helps me learn how
to be a better actress

35:21.020 --> 35:23.022
so I play them.

35:24.590 --> 35:28.995
- Easy, all right then play me.

35:31.063 --> 35:34.733
- What?
- Play me, it's easy right?

35:34.733 --> 35:38.137
- And you're even more stupid.

35:39.672 --> 35:42.942
- I lied, I like you, you're
funny. You have a point there.

35:44.777 --> 35:46.278
Play me, what's there to lose?

35:47.380 --> 35:51.017
- There's nothing to gain.

35:51.017 --> 35:52.852
- See, I lied again.

35:52.852 --> 35:55.522
There's something to lose for you anyways,

35:55.522 --> 35:57.390
being exposed and all.

35:57.390 --> 35:59.992
- Yeah, and how are you gonna do that?

35:59.992 --> 36:00.860
- Well, there's the fact

36:00.860 --> 36:02.928
that I just recorded everything you said.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.733
Just taking recommendations.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.735
Playing smarter this time.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.765
- [Jenny] Boys, they never learn.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.303
Don't worry mom, I will make you proud.

37:32.785 --> 37:35.387
(upbeat music)

37:36.255 --> 37:37.122
- Hey, what's up?

37:38.190 --> 37:40.258
- Remind me why we're here again?

37:40.258 --> 37:42.127
- Waiting for you to blow your charm.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.563
- It doesn't work like that.

37:47.132 --> 37:51.170
And besides, I still don't wanna do this.

37:51.170 --> 37:52.838
- What, are you actually scared

37:52.838 --> 37:54.407
your heart's gonna get into it?

38:00.780 --> 38:02.315
- Or are you too scared

38:02.315 --> 38:04.583
that your heart's actually
gonna get into it?

38:05.852 --> 38:07.787
- Oh, now we're talking.

38:10.155 --> 38:12.792
It's okay, don't worry, tough skin.

38:20.498 --> 38:25.403
- I break hearts not skin.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.542
- Not funny, try to think of a comeback

38:29.542 --> 38:31.443
while I come back with the food, okay?

39:17.022 --> 39:20.225
Slow down, Jenny!

39:20.225 --> 39:21.227
- Hi!
- What?

39:21.227 --> 39:22.093
What do you want?

39:23.795 --> 39:25.865
- You didn't return my
phone call last night.

39:25.865 --> 39:27.933
- Because like I said, I was on a date.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.868
Not that it's any of your business.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.637
And why did you crash my date?

39:31.637 --> 39:34.273
- Because why are you even
dating that girl anyways?

39:35.340 --> 39:37.208
You don't even know her.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.178
- Sarah, I think the definition of dating

39:39.178 --> 39:40.913
is getting to know people.

39:40.913 --> 39:43.715
- Exactly, what we should be doing.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.383
- No, it's what we did.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.220
Now I know you, which
is why we're not dating.

39:48.220 --> 39:53.025
- Hey, I'm sorry I cheated on you.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.863
But, what makes you think this Jenny girl

39:57.863 --> 39:58.897
is any different huh?

40:01.800 --> 40:05.703
- Nothing, but I know
you're not any different

40:05.703 --> 40:08.740
and I'd rather take a risk
with anyone else but you.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.242
This is done.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.512
I'm not into you, it's over.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.622
- It's not over.

40:24.957 --> 40:26.792
We've only just begun.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.732
- Can you just stop
running and hear me out?

40:33.732 --> 40:34.700
- What?

40:34.700 --> 40:36.402
- Why did you leave last night?

40:36.402 --> 40:38.570
- Are you seriously
asking me that question?

40:41.240 --> 40:42.942
How am I supposed to do this

40:42.942 --> 40:46.478
when your crazy girlfriend
tries to kill me.

40:46.478 --> 40:49.648
- Okay first, for the last
time, she is not my girlfriend.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.652
Secondly, you don't need
to worry about her anymore.

40:52.652 --> 40:55.822
- Really, well how am I
supposed to believe that

40:55.822 --> 40:56.855
or trust that even?

40:58.590 --> 41:01.893
- Because relationships are about trust.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.797
Also, I talked to her.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.333
She won't bother you anymore believe me.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.173
- Okay, whatever.
(upbeat music)

41:14.173 --> 41:17.543
But if we're doing this,
we have to have a timeline.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.547
- Deal.

41:37.597 --> 41:39.030
- Caleb!
- What's up?

41:40.032 --> 41:41.233
How are you doing?
- Good.

41:41.233 --> 41:42.868
What you drinking there?

41:42.868 --> 41:44.537
- This off brand sprite.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.338
How's the script going?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.807
- Good, a bit clustered right now,

41:48.807 --> 41:50.175
but it'll get done.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.478
- Oh so how did it go?

41:53.478 --> 41:54.813
- She agreed to it.

41:54.813 --> 41:57.082
Three weeks before finals.

41:57.082 --> 42:00.585
She said she'd give me time to sulk.

42:00.585 --> 42:01.820
- So she doesn't know
what's coming her way huh?

42:01.820 --> 42:02.955
- Not a clue.

42:02.955 --> 42:04.657
Yeah, she thinks she's playing me.

42:06.392 --> 42:08.460
- You're actually playing her.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.428
- But she's smart so give me time

42:10.428 --> 42:12.163
and keep this under the table.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.732
Don't tell no one.

42:13.732 --> 42:14.567
- I won't.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.603
- So now on the script.

42:17.603 --> 42:19.405
- All right, so what I was thinking,

42:22.808 --> 42:25.043
I think that she should be
a little bit more conserved.

42:26.112 --> 42:28.947
(mid tempo music)

42:30.182 --> 42:31.850
- So why'd you come to college?

42:31.850 --> 42:32.685
Because of me?

42:34.387 --> 42:35.653
- You're so full of yourself.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.290
- I mean, if not, then why?

42:41.560 --> 42:44.863
- I dunno, everyone kept mentioning it,

42:45.998 --> 42:48.833
figured I'd get it out of the way,

42:51.903 --> 42:54.373
since they wanted to do away with me.

42:54.373 --> 42:56.908
- Why would anyone wanna do away with you?

43:07.585 --> 43:08.920
What are you doing?

43:08.920 --> 43:09.888
- What?

43:09.888 --> 43:12.625
- That vibey thing you
just did with your eyes.

43:12.625 --> 43:13.992
Are you trying to charm me?

43:18.530 --> 43:20.398
I don't think you're good.

43:20.398 --> 43:21.867
- Excuse me?

43:21.867 --> 43:23.735
- I don't think you're a good player.

43:23.735 --> 43:25.170
See, you say you play guys,

43:25.170 --> 43:28.040
but I think you're still bluffing.

43:30.242 --> 43:33.812
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

43:37.048 --> 43:37.883
- Okay.

43:45.423 --> 43:48.127
So why did you break up at Sarah?

43:49.562 --> 43:54.265
'Cause I can tell she's
still into you player.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.170
- I'm not a player.
- Really?

43:59.572 --> 44:04.543
- No, I broke up with Sarah
because she cheated on me

44:06.312 --> 44:09.047
with my best friend, or at least was.

44:13.485 --> 44:17.288
- Well, it seems like you're
attracted to bad girls.

44:19.090 --> 44:21.560
- Nah, I wouldn't say that.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.095
I don't think you're bad.

44:23.095 --> 44:24.697
I think you're hiding something.

44:26.432 --> 44:27.800
That's what I'm after.

44:32.872 --> 44:34.105
- Thank you for today.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.010
- Sure, any guy would've done the same.

44:38.010 --> 44:40.478
- You would not believe me if I told you.

44:40.478 --> 44:41.413
- What do you mean?

44:42.948 --> 44:44.115
- My last boyfriend.

44:48.687 --> 44:51.022
I don't know, he put me in
really unhealthy situations

44:52.357 --> 44:56.395
He was really abusive.

44:58.763 --> 45:00.498
I mean, I'm over it you know.

45:04.470 --> 45:07.740
I don't know, I should really go.

45:07.740 --> 45:08.573
- Hey.

45:14.647 --> 45:19.652
- Thanks again for today and listening.

45:19.885 --> 45:24.288
- Of course, what else
are boyfriends for huh?

45:25.257 --> 45:26.358
I'll see you tomorrow?

45:28.027 --> 45:29.928
- See you.
- See you.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.530
(upbeat music)

45:41.540 --> 45:42.373
That's one lie down.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.820
So tell me fearless player,

45:55.820 --> 45:58.723
what's the number one way to
get a guy to fall for a girl?

46:06.097 --> 46:06.998
- Dig a pit

46:10.702 --> 46:12.938
and push him in.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.008
- Oh, is that what you do?

46:18.477 --> 46:19.845
- You're so stupid.

46:25.883 --> 46:28.787
- Here, let's take a picture.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.422
The food looks really good.

46:30.422 --> 46:31.557
You wanna use my phone?

46:32.457 --> 46:35.260
- Hmm mmh, I think we should use my phone.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.862
- Why?

46:36.862 --> 46:38.863
- Well, 'cause I've
got a better camera so.

46:38.863 --> 46:41.065
- Let's go.
- [Caleb] Oh, okay.

46:41.065 --> 46:43.168
- You wanna take it.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.002
- I'll take it.

46:50.875 --> 46:54.045
(phone camera clicks)

47:01.687 --> 47:03.922
Nice.
- Okay, we good?

47:03.922 --> 47:05.423
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

47:06.258 --> 47:10.028
- Oh.
- Oh, that looks kinda bad.

47:10.028 --> 47:10.862
- It's okay.

47:10.862 --> 47:11.663
They look good. At least, I do.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.667
- (giggles) Whatever, excuse me.

47:21.340 --> 47:24.877
- Wait, is this you as a kid?

47:24.877 --> 47:26.010
- What?

47:26.010 --> 47:28.280
- You're so cute.
- Give me that.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.415
- Is that your mom?
- Okay, stop, Caleb!

47:35.720 --> 47:37.322
- No.
- Caleb!

47:37.322 --> 47:41.460
- No, you're so adorable.
- Caleb, give me that.

47:41.460 --> 47:42.393
Give me that!

47:48.767 --> 47:49.702
(Jenny gasping)

47:49.702 --> 47:54.105
- Jenny, Jenny, are you okay?

47:55.007 --> 47:56.675
I'll get some water.

48:04.182 --> 48:08.020
Here, it's okay Jenny
just breathe, it's okay.

48:11.357 --> 48:13.492
Jenny, you just had a panic attack.

48:13.492 --> 48:14.358
Are you okay?

48:16.462 --> 48:17.362
Are you good?

48:19.230 --> 48:20.565
Is it something you saw?

48:21.633 --> 48:23.202
Something I did.

48:23.202 --> 48:25.470
Do you usually get panic attacks?

48:27.038 --> 48:31.142
- Can you just stop asking
all these questions?

48:32.577 --> 48:34.980
- I was just trying to
make sure you're okay.

48:45.357 --> 48:49.193
It's not like you would
believe me if I told you.

48:50.728 --> 48:53.565
- And why would that
stop you fearless player?

49:04.242 --> 49:06.312
- Thanks for today.

49:12.550 --> 49:15.387
(mid tempo music)

49:16.455 --> 49:20.458
We will resume our play tomorrow.

49:30.235 --> 49:33.872
- Just so you know, I
would have believed you.

49:53.925 --> 49:57.395
- [Electronic voice] You
have two saved messages.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.563
Saved message.

49:59.430 --> 50:02.367
- [Caleb] Hey Jenny, it's Caleb.

50:02.367 --> 50:04.568
Look, I just wanna apologize

50:04.568 --> 50:06.638
for being too pushy the other day.

50:06.638 --> 50:10.308
It wasn't my intention to
make you feel any kind of way.

50:12.310 --> 50:13.145
I hope you're doing okay.

50:13.145 --> 50:13.978
Please text me if you need anything.

50:22.287 --> 50:25.957
- [Electronic voice]
To replay this message.

50:29.895 --> 50:32.330
(mid tempo music)

50:32.330 --> 50:34.032
- [Jenny] I like to keep to myself.

50:34.032 --> 50:39.003
So I spend all my time
wondering, walking alone

50:39.470 --> 50:42.740
and lost in a world of books,

50:42.740 --> 50:45.943
visiting places like the reading center.

50:45.943 --> 50:49.647
- Yeah for sure, I'll read the script.

50:49.647 --> 50:52.150
- [Jenny] Oh, I did not
know he worked here.

50:53.752 --> 50:54.920
- Hello, yeah?

50:59.457 --> 51:00.292
- [Jenny] Or did I?

51:00.292 --> 51:02.127
- I mean currently at the moment we don't,

51:02.127 --> 51:05.063
but I mean if you do come
personally we are able to help.

51:06.432 --> 51:09.267
Yeah no, our customer
service reps should be able

51:09.267 --> 51:11.202
to potentially do that.

51:16.007 --> 51:18.243
No, we don't provide free shipping.

51:28.687 --> 51:30.955
Okay, I'll see you soon then.

51:32.723 --> 51:33.958
All right, bye.

51:45.137 --> 51:46.070
May I sit here?

51:47.405 --> 51:49.573
- It's a free campus last time I checked.

52:16.568 --> 52:19.972
Are you seriously just gonna
sit here, just to read a book?

52:22.240 --> 52:23.542
- Last time I checked,

52:23.542 --> 52:26.043
me opening my lips wasn't
your love language.

52:34.085 --> 52:39.057
- Well, last time I checked
persistence wasn't really yours.

52:48.267 --> 52:49.868
- Anyways, what are you reading?

52:53.037 --> 52:53.872
- You.

52:55.140 --> 52:56.473
- Oh no, that's good.

52:57.442 --> 52:58.277
See, that's good,

52:58.277 --> 53:01.445
but I don't think you can afford this one.

53:01.445 --> 53:05.017
I'm not a copy like the
rest you're used to.

53:07.618 --> 53:08.820
- I need to purchase it.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.923
I just need to steal your heart.

53:14.058 --> 53:16.662
- Funny, do you keep a book

53:16.662 --> 53:18.797
about relationships burns or something?

53:20.132 --> 53:21.833
- No, that's a good idea.

53:21.833 --> 53:23.100
I should start doing that.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.202
- Oh yeah, you should.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.408
But what about those relationship burns

53:30.408 --> 53:32.243
that actually leave scars?

53:33.445 --> 53:34.345
You could probably write a book

53:34.345 --> 53:36.948
or two over all the fights you've had.

53:40.585 --> 53:43.020
Is that why you panicked the other day?

53:48.293 --> 53:49.593
- I'm late for class.

53:52.463 --> 53:53.298
- Nice chat.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.557
- Remember everything I've told you?

54:19.557 --> 54:20.692
Diane's he's gonna be waiting for you.

54:20.692 --> 54:21.558
Do not worry.

54:21.558 --> 54:23.862
Do not look back no
matter what happens, okay?

54:23.862 --> 54:24.695
No matter what you're hear.

54:24.695 --> 54:25.497
Do you understand?

54:25.497 --> 54:27.598
- And then what about you?

54:27.598 --> 54:28.433
- Don't worry about me baby.

54:28.433 --> 54:29.267
I'm gonna be just fine.

54:29.267 --> 54:32.270
I'm gonna be right after you, okay?

54:35.273 --> 54:37.142
Okay, so here you go.

54:37.142 --> 54:38.208
I'm gonna be right after you, okay?

54:38.208 --> 54:42.780
Don't worry, take this,
run as fast as you can.

54:42.780 --> 54:45.083
Do you understand?

54:45.083 --> 54:47.252
I'll see you very soon, okay?

54:56.862 --> 54:59.530
(Jenny sighing)

55:18.082 --> 55:20.118
- So how did it go that night?

55:20.118 --> 55:21.987
Did the plan work?

55:21.987 --> 55:23.120
- I mean, the night went well,

55:23.120 --> 55:25.757
but she's just so full of crap.

55:25.757 --> 55:27.758
I can see right through her lies.

55:27.758 --> 55:29.327
- Yeah, I can see that.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.235
- But I don't know, she
was different this time.

55:38.268 --> 55:39.737
- How so?

55:39.737 --> 55:42.907
- I'm still trying to figure that out.

55:45.977 --> 55:47.478
It doesn't matter.

55:49.147 --> 55:51.215
Otherwise, have you gone over this?

55:51.215 --> 55:54.085
- I have, but the professor
said that he was going through

55:54.085 --> 55:55.953
that part instead of this
part that you were studying.

55:57.522 --> 55:59.157
It's cool though. I'll
catch you up though.

59:30.402 --> 59:33.303
(door creaks open)

59:36.540 --> 59:38.977
- How'd you know I'd be here?

59:40.312 --> 59:42.413
- Anywhere above normal is where you are.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.717
- I don't care what you do with the tapes.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.587
The deal is done.

59:49.587 --> 59:51.455
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

59:53.692 --> 59:54.625
You hate me.

59:55.527 --> 59:56.393
I deserve it.

59:57.762 --> 59:58.697
- I was wrong.

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.568
Two wrongs don't make a right.

1:00:04.568 --> 1:00:06.303
Only God can judge.

1:00:06.303 --> 1:00:07.672
- Well, I don't believe that.

1:00:11.042 --> 1:00:16.047
- Before I was born, my
mom didn't wanna keep me

1:00:17.082 --> 1:00:18.950
because of how she got pregnant with me,

1:00:20.752 --> 1:00:22.153
but she kept me anyways.

1:00:25.222 --> 1:00:29.227
I get hurting people
because you've been hurt.

1:00:30.762 --> 1:00:31.595
But what if you're bigger than that?

1:00:33.965 --> 1:00:34.798
You know?

1:00:36.767 --> 1:00:40.772
Sometimes our greatest miracles come

1:00:40.772 --> 1:00:42.173
from our worst mistakes.

1:00:51.548 --> 1:00:55.853
Deleted, you can talk to me if you want.

1:01:04.262 --> 1:01:07.865
- You really wanna know
why I do what I do?

1:01:08.733 --> 1:01:13.570
Why I had that panic yesterday?

1:01:20.878 --> 1:01:25.750
I have nightmares almost every day.

1:01:27.218 --> 1:01:28.218
I have no family.

1:01:31.222 --> 1:01:34.458
My mom, she

1:01:37.328 --> 1:01:38.162
She died

1:01:39.530 --> 1:01:40.363
Trying to save me.

1:01:46.503 --> 1:01:49.840
She tried to save me
from child trafficking

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.845
and I ran (sobbing).

1:01:56.580 --> 1:01:58.983
I ran and I heard her scream.

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:07.092
And I couldn't do anything about it.

1:02:19.537 --> 1:02:21.138
And I never forget.

1:02:24.908 --> 1:02:27.512
I never forget, I never forget.

1:02:31.282 --> 1:02:36.287
So I think it's okay to
take a little revenge.

1:02:37.355 --> 1:02:40.925
In some twisted way, it
helps me feel closer to her.

1:02:41.992 --> 1:02:45.095
So I'm sorry.

1:02:48.032 --> 1:02:50.802
I'm sorry if I think I can play God,

1:02:53.470 --> 1:02:55.405
but maybe He needs a little help.

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:05.783
I told you you wouldn't get it.

1:03:38.748 --> 1:03:40.918
Do we really have to do this?

1:03:40.918 --> 1:03:42.253
- Yes, now come on.

1:03:42.253 --> 1:03:43.855
Truth or dare?

1:03:43.855 --> 1:03:48.292
- (sighs) Truth.

1:03:48.292 --> 1:03:51.495
- Truth, do you believe in God?

1:03:52.763 --> 1:03:55.132
- Whoa, you're intense.

1:03:59.203 --> 1:04:01.405
I don't know

1:04:04.275 --> 1:04:05.108
Try another one.

1:04:08.445 --> 1:04:10.447
- You don't like acting?

1:04:11.982 --> 1:04:14.785
- Take it down two notches
from intensity yeah?

1:04:14.785 --> 1:04:17.355
(laughing altogether)

1:04:17.355 --> 1:04:18.355
- You like to write?

1:04:19.657 --> 1:04:20.692
- Yeah, I do.

1:04:22.627 --> 1:04:24.862
I used to write with my mom so...

1:04:28.165 --> 1:04:30.133
You are way too much of a counselor.

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:33.203
- (chuckles) I get that a lot.

1:04:37.508 --> 1:04:38.342
- Another one?

1:04:38.342 --> 1:04:41.645
- Yeah, I pick truth.

1:04:43.047 --> 1:04:45.482
- Okay, um...

1:04:52.022 --> 1:04:54.058
You've always liked me?

1:04:58.930 --> 1:05:00.263
- Nope, not answerable.

1:05:01.565 --> 1:05:04.902
I mean, I say, yes, you win.

1:05:05.903 --> 1:05:07.738
I say no, you know.

1:05:08.705 --> 1:05:09.873
Either way, you win.

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:13.377
- We're not even doing that anymore.

1:05:15.078 --> 1:05:19.650
But what the heck did you just say?

1:05:19.650 --> 1:05:20.652
- I don't even know.

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.320
Let's just, another one.

1:05:24.488 --> 1:05:28.058
- Yeah, let's do dare.

1:05:28.058 --> 1:05:33.063
- Dare!

1:05:35.833 --> 1:05:37.167
I dare you

1:05:37.167 --> 1:05:39.070
to go on a date with me.

1:05:39.070 --> 1:05:40.772
One that my heart won't be afraid

1:05:40.772 --> 1:05:43.140
of being shattered into a million pieces.

1:05:45.943 --> 1:05:48.645
- That's an awfully huge dare.

1:05:49.580 --> 1:05:50.447
- It is.

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:57.788
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:00.958
- Maybe.

1:06:14.372 --> 1:06:16.940
(upbeat music)

1:07:11.795 --> 1:07:14.365
(upbeat music)

1:07:19.103 --> 1:07:20.537
- Do you have something you wanna tell me?

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:21.372
(speaking in foreign language)

1:07:21.372 --> 1:07:23.707
- Why is Caleb dating that freak?

1:07:23.707 --> 1:07:24.708
(speaking in foreign language)

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:25.877
- Quit it with the fake French.

1:07:25.877 --> 1:07:26.943
Okay, I'm being serious.

1:07:26.943 --> 1:07:29.913
Hey!
- Can I pass?

1:07:29.913 --> 1:07:32.783
- Not unless you tell me.

1:07:32.783 --> 1:07:34.585
- I'll tell you what,
he might like the girl.

1:07:34.585 --> 1:07:35.418
But you should probably get over a guy

1:07:35.418 --> 1:07:38.922
who dumped you like two years ago.

1:07:38.922 --> 1:07:40.690
- Maybe I should.

1:07:40.690 --> 1:07:42.058
But it's not gonna be
my story that ends up

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:43.693
in "College Vanity" this week.

1:07:43.693 --> 1:07:47.130
It's gonna be yours for
forcing yourself upon me.

1:07:47.130 --> 1:07:48.832
- I didn't do that.

1:07:48.832 --> 1:07:52.903
- I'll make it up unless you tell me.

1:07:52.903 --> 1:07:54.472
- But isn't that against the
SPJ journalists code of ethics-

1:07:54.472 --> 1:07:55.773
- Hey, hey, hey, stop!

1:07:55.773 --> 1:07:57.340
Okay, something fishy is going on here.

1:07:57.340 --> 1:07:59.810
Plus, I heard you two talking
in the hallway so spill.

1:08:01.378 --> 1:08:03.547
- I hate you.

1:08:03.547 --> 1:08:04.615
- I hate you too.

1:08:04.615 --> 1:08:07.718
- Look, you can't tell
anyone this all right?

1:08:07.718 --> 1:08:10.387
- Sure, my lips are sealed.

1:08:12.288 --> 1:08:15.125
(mid tempo music)

1:08:53.163 --> 1:08:56.767

1:08:56.767 --> 1:08:58.435

1:10:14.745 --> 1:10:16.247

"'You've been dumped,' Caleb Bradley said

1:10:30.527 --> 1:10:32.697

"to break hearts."

1:10:54.852 --> 1:10:55.685

1:10:55.685 --> 1:10:56.620

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:57.453

Everybody's gonna know who she really is.

1:11:09.733 --> 1:11:11.302

Don't.

Sara's just a freak.

1:13:47.457 --> 1:13:49.092
You can't say freak.

1:13:52.295 --> 1:13:53.130
I'm so stupid.

1:13:54.565 --> 1:13:57.968
Jenny, you know Sarah,
she just makes things up.

1:13:57.968 --> 1:13:59.803
She doesn't mean that.

1:14:02.907 --> 1:14:07.143

would never try to hurt you.

1:14:13.317 --> 1:14:14.150

Moses, this is Caleb.

1:14:58.295 --> 1:14:59.963
I just came to Jenny's apartment.

1:14:59.963 --> 1:15:01.598
I can't find her anywhere.

1:15:01.598 --> 1:15:03.800
Can you check to see if she went to Dallas

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:05.602
or if she's with Diane or something?

1:15:11.808 --> 1:15:14.812
(cellphone ringing)

1:15:16.847 --> 1:15:18.082

1:15:18.082 --> 1:15:22.218
- Hey Diane, is Jenny with you?

1:15:22.218 --> 1:15:25.288
- Jenny, no, is everything okay?

1:15:29.258 --> 1:15:30.827
- She's not with Diane, Caleb.

1:15:31.695 --> 1:15:34.030
I'm scared of what she's
gonna do to herself.

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:35.465
We need to find her.

1:15:40.403 --> 1:15:41.238
- Jenny!

1:15:46.743 --> 1:15:47.978
- [Starlight] I wish
I could have saved you

1:15:47.978 --> 1:15:49.613
from knowing the truth,

1:15:49.613 --> 1:15:51.482
but you were born from pain

1:15:51.482 --> 1:15:54.150
and that's what makes
you the greatest miracle.

1:15:54.150 --> 1:15:56.987
You took the painful
journey to arrive to me

1:15:56.987 --> 1:15:59.790
and for that I am very sorry.

1:16:02.025 --> 1:16:03.660
I wish it could have been any different.

1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:07.463
I really do, but you are
not defined by your past.

1:16:07.463 --> 1:16:09.132

Don't let it hold you back.

1:16:12.068 --> 1:16:14.605
Don't let it bind you and
stop you from dreaming.

1:16:14.605 --> 1:16:16.540
Don't let it break you and tie you

1:16:16.540 --> 1:16:20.177
in chains of unforgiveness,
revenge and heartbreak.

1:16:20.177 --> 1:16:22.712
Nothing can hold you down.

1:16:22.712 --> 1:16:24.948
Live free, break free

1:16:24.948 --> 1:16:28.085
because that is who
you were created to be.

1:16:28.085 --> 1:16:31.053
And if you're reading
this, know that I am free

1:16:31.053 --> 1:16:34.223
in a place where there
is no pain and no chains.

1:16:34.223 --> 1:16:35.858
I will always love you

1:16:35.858 --> 1:16:37.860
with all of my heart.

1:16:37.860 --> 1:16:39.763
Your mother, Starlight

1:16:45.735 --> 1:16:47.337
- Jenny!

1:16:47.337 --> 1:16:49.538
- [Jenny] I used to
think that God hated me.

1:16:50.473 --> 1:16:55.145
That love was a trap and
love needed to be earned,

1:16:56.012 --> 1:16:57.813
but I don't think like that anymore.

1:16:58.682 --> 1:17:03.687
What if He's here all around
us and present to comfort us?

1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:06.357
What if our brokenness doesn't scare Him?

1:17:06.357 --> 1:17:08.925
What if they actually attract Him?

1:17:08.925 --> 1:17:10.360
You have to be willing to take a risk

1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:12.328
if you believe in something or someone.

1:17:13.263 --> 1:17:15.198
And then life gets crazy,

1:17:15.198 --> 1:17:19.002
just you remember, God's got
you in the palm of His hands.

1:17:19.002 --> 1:17:20.837
No keeping score.

1:17:20.837 --> 1:17:23.240
No expectation of perfection.

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:24.742
No counting your sins.

1:17:25.575 --> 1:17:27.977
No strings, only love.
