WEBVTT

00:09.209 --> 00:13.213
(symphony playing on stereo)

00:13.213 --> 00:14.202
(turns up volume)

00:14.547 --> 00:16.105
(orchestra playing softly)

00:20.620 --> 00:23.612
(orchestra begins loud,
cadential flourish)

00:28.628 --> 00:31.529
(orchestra plays final chord)

00:32.064 --> 00:33.133
Boo!

00:33.133 --> 00:35.124
(high-pitched scream)

00:35.235 --> 00:37.203
(laughter)

00:37.570 --> 00:39.572
That is not funny!

00:39.572 --> 00:42.234
You don't sneak up on someone and startle them.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.278
and secondly,
I only did it to prove a point.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.644
And you called it--
he does scream like a woman.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.449
I do not scream like a woman.
It was a manly, throaty wail.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.320
Frasier, you may want
to call security.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.822
As I got off the elevator,

00:55.822 --> 00:58.313
I heard a woman screaming
hysterically.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.194
That was me.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.196
I was innocently conducting
some Brahms

01:03.196 --> 01:05.096
when our madcap father
decided to startle me.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.801
Oh, quit whining.
I used to scare you kids all the time

01:07.801 --> 01:09.803
when we went camping
-- you used to love it.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.304
Remember the story about the couple

01:11.304 --> 01:12.794
making out in the
car who got slashed

01:13.306 --> 01:14.796
by the killer
with the hook?
Yes, I remember

01:15.241 --> 01:18.812
I couldn't kiss a woman in a c
until I was 30.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.814
Yeah, well, your father
doesn't have that problem--

01:20.814 --> 01:22.816
Mr. Reclining Bucket Seats.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.817
(lascivious growl)

01:23.817 --> 01:25.307
You want me to scream again?

01:27.187 --> 01:29.155
Dad, when'd you get
the new cane?

01:29.155 --> 01:30.247
Oh, Ronee got it for me.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.258
Yeah, he's too young
for that old man can
e.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.748
This is much
more his style
.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.197
Give me a top hat,
and I'm Fred Astaire.

01:37.197 --> 01:40.223
Add a monocle,
and you're Mr. Peanut.

01:42.869 --> 01:46.270
Hey, Frasier. Coulrophobia?

01:46.639 --> 01:48.708
I have a patient
who suffers from it.
What is it?

01:48.708 --> 01:50.300
It's a very rare disorder,

01:50.443 --> 01:52.377
a crippling fear of clowns
.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.613
Yes, I'm treating a pediatric nurse
who is terrified

01:54.814 --> 01:57.383
every time one comes to visit the child
ren at her hospital.

01:57.383 --> 01:58.885
It's almost cost her her job.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.284
Poor thing.
We're making
great progress.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.722
Through some rather
groundbreaking techniques

02:02.722 --> 02:04.224
I've devised, I think
we're close to a cure.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.725
Really?
Yes.

02:05.725 --> 02:08.717
I wouldn't be surprised
if this may turn out to be my...

02:09.229 --> 02:11.231
clowning achievement.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.220
(laughing)

02:12.632 --> 02:14.190
That sounded better
in your head, didn't it?

02:14.701 --> 02:17.568
Vastly.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.339
Well, I don't blame her
for hating clowns.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.328
They're weird and creepy.

02:20.840 --> 02:21.841
That was one
of the reasons

02:21.841 --> 02:23.331
I never took you kids
to the circus.

02:23.676 --> 02:24.734
Which I always resented.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.736
You know how much I wanted
to be a trapeze artist.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.583
I even decorated a unitard

02:30.583 --> 02:32.585
in the style
of the Flying Wallendas

02:32.585 --> 02:35.281
to wear when we visited
the big top.

02:35.522 --> 02:38.191
That was the other reason.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.361
Well, I'll go check on dinner.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.229
I'm gonna have
to make this
an early evening.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.231
I'm leaving in
the morning to
visit my mother.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.220
She moved last
year to Spokane.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.734
I remember your mom.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.498
She used to chaperone
our dances, right?
Oh, yeah.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.773
She also taught
Sunday school andled the church choir.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.775
day
Must've been a very windy

02:55.775 --> 02:58.266
when the apple fell
from that tree.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.487
(music box playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

03:07.487 --> 03:08.888
You're doing fine, Mimi.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.880
There's nothing to be afraid of.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.893
Right.
Just a tiny,

03:13.893 --> 03:15.395
inanimate piece of plastic--

03:15.395 --> 03:16.885
it couldn't
possibly hurt you.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.730
(music continues)
I know.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.399
You're doing great.

03:20.733 --> 03:21.700
I feel good.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.203
(screaming hysterically)

03:25.371 --> 03:27.236
(gasping
and whimpering)

03:29.609 --> 03:30.677
Much better.

03:30.677 --> 03:31.678
(chuckles)

03:31.678 --> 03:33.680
Really?
Yes, yes.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.383
You're still in the
room; you didn't throw up.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.372
That's a big improvement.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.381
All right, now...
give me your hand.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.923
Here's the tiny little hat.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.694
Tiny little hat, right.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.396
And the big red nose.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.397
A big red nose.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.262
Now, Mimi,

03:53.466 --> 03:54.558
is there anything
you'd like to say

03:55.235 --> 03:55.894
to our little clown friend?

03:56.302 --> 03:57.403
Please don't kill me!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.394
!
.
No

03:59.639 --> 04:00.970
No, Mimi.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.243
Oh, I-I mean, uh...

04:03.243 --> 04:06.610
you're my friend,
and I like you.

04:06.846 --> 04:07.904
Excellent, Mimi.
(laughs)

04:08.414 --> 04:10.405
(chuckling):
All right, then.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.375
Now, tomorrow

04:12.685 --> 04:14.312
we will take our biggest step yet.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.257
No, I really don't think...
No, no, I...
You are ready.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.416
You are.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.427
In the safety
of this environment,

04:21.427 --> 04:24.731
you'll watch me transform myseIf

04:24.731 --> 04:28.428
into a real live clown.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.574
I will apply the makeup...

04:34.574 --> 04:37.577
and then I'll put on
the clown suit

04:37.577 --> 04:40.569
and the big funny shoes,

04:40.980 --> 04:43.312
and time permitting,

04:43.516 --> 04:45.609
I will make animal balloons.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.318
And you really think
that'll work?

04:50.490 --> 04:51.557
or
As long as you don't ask f

04:51.557 --> 04:53.047
anything too complicated,
like a giraffe.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.796
up.
Well, our time is

04:56.796 --> 04:58.787
Um... all right,
then, Mimi,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.301
I will see you tomorrow,

05:01.301 --> 05:02.791
and rest assured,
I will talk you

05:03.303 --> 05:04.804
through every step of the way.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.306
There's nothing to be afraid of.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.807
There willbe no surprises.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.342
(screams)

05:09.342 --> 05:11.606
(chuckling) :
I'm so... so sorry!

05:11.878 --> 05:13.446
Here. There he goes.
All right, now.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.448
I will see you
later, then.
All right.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.938
(screams)

05:17.450 --> 05:18.451
)
(chuckling

05:18.451 --> 05:20.453
Again, I'm so sorry--
little fellow really is

05:20.453 --> 05:21.442
he?
full of mischief, isn't

05:21.954 --> 05:23.456
You mean you're not
controlling it?!

05:23.456 --> 05:26.323
.
Yes. Yes,
of course I am

05:26.526 --> 05:28.118
Anyway, I will, uh,
see you tomorrow.

05:28.594 --> 05:29.583
Yeah.
Double session.

05:29.862 --> 05:31.955
(whimpering)
(chuckles)

05:33.000 --> 05:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:49.015 --> 05:50.004
Boo!
(screeches)

05:50.516 --> 05:52.006
(laughing)

05:54.420 --> 05:55.717
What is the
matter with you?

05:56.422 --> 05:59.721
You keep standing in empty rooms
with your back to the door.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.415
an.
I'm only hum

06:01.728 --> 06:03.730
Oh, I wish Ronee
could've seen that one.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.425
I'm glad that your little
girlfriend is making you

06:05.732 --> 06:06.733
feel young again,
but you're acting

06:06.733 --> 06:08.434
Iike an irresponsible
adolescent.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.423
(mocking) :
Irresponsible adolescent.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.634
Mimicking me now.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.904
(mocking) :
Mimicking me now.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.699
Stop it. Did you specifically
come down here to torture me?

06:16.008 --> 06:17.577
No. I'm picking up Niles
for a movie,

06:17.577 --> 06:19.545
but he's still got someone in his office.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.410
Yes, as do I, unfortunately.
Now, off you go.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.650
Oh... when did you forget
how to have fun?

06:24.650 --> 06:26.152
You've turned into
such a fuddy-duddy.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.653
Well, forgive me

06:27.653 --> 06:29.644
if I prefer humor
of a more elevated level.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.157
,
I tell you

06:31.157 --> 06:33.659
I might actually enjoy
one of your little japes one day

06:33.659 --> 06:35.161
if you could come up
with something

06:35.161 --> 06:37.152
with a bit more wit
and sophistication.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.439
(phone ringing)

06:46.439 --> 06:48.174
Hello?

06:48.174 --> 06:49.442
Yes, well,
I'm afraid my calendar's

06:49.442 --> 06:51.511
rather booked right now.

06:51.511 --> 06:52.678
Well, all right.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.112
I suppose I could try
to squeeze you in somewhere.

06:55.615 --> 06:59.483
Uh... yes, uh,
and your last name, please?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.489
Rection. That's unusual.

07:03.489 --> 07:06.092
And your first name?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.083
That's not funny, either, Dad.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.535
Oh, hello, Roz
Hi.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.832
Oh, thanks for
bringing that over
.No problem.

07:17.537 --> 07:18.538
I'm warning you, though,

07:18.538 --> 07:19.835
that clown makeup is
a bitch to get off.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.697
,
I wore it
for Alice's birthday party

07:22.208 --> 07:24.710
and for a whole week afterwards,
I looked like a Kabuki hooker.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.200
Oh, yes,
that was around

07:26.712 --> 07:28.714
the time
of the Seabee Awards ceremony.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.717
I remember, you looked rather
comically made-up that night.

07:31.717 --> 07:32.706
I'd gotten it off
by then.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.856
Yoo-hoo, Frasier.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.552
Don't be afraid.
I'm coming in the door.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.029
Very funny, Dad.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.018
Roz, do you think it's funny

07:44.530 --> 07:45.531
when someone sneaks up
behind you

07:45.531 --> 07:47.033
?
.
and jolts you out of your skin

07:47.033 --> 07:48.022
--
Let me guess

07:48.534 --> 07:50.729
somebody screamed like a woman.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.563
Yes, all right.
Good night, Roz.
Bye.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.576
I thought you were
having dinner with Niles.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.578
He canceled.
Something else came up.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.080
I'm just gonna watch
the game in my room.
All right.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.082
But don't worry.
If I come out for a beer,

08:03.082 --> 08:04.083
I'll call ahead.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.585
Wouldn't want you to think

08:05.585 --> 08:08.076
there was an intruder
in the house.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.988
It's about ten years too late for that.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.737
Dad, I'm going to go out
for a while!

08:24.737 --> 08:26.239
See you later!

08:26.239 --> 08:28.741
MARTIN:
All right, see you!

08:28.741 --> 08:30.231
(jingles keys)

09:16.222 --> 09:18.713
(rings doorbell repeatedly)

09:34.340 --> 09:35.841
(vicious yell)
(screams)

09:35.841 --> 09:38.332
(laughing)

09:40.646 --> 09:44.183
Oh, you were right, Dad.
That's hilarious!

09:44.183 --> 09:46.174
Not such
a fuddy-duddy now, am I?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.619
That's quite
a comeback, Dad.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.611
A heart attack.
Come on, get up.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.626
Dad.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.329
Dad, you can get up now.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.819
Dad!

10:03.869 --> 10:04.631
Frasier.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.905
Niles...

10:05.905 --> 10:06.894
Dad?
How's

10:07.340 --> 10:09.375
Well, he's resting,
he's stable, his
color is good.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.876
Can I see him?

10:10.876 --> 10:12.878
They're running some tests.
The doctor should be out.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.380
How did this happen?

10:14.380 --> 10:19.613
Well, there's so many factors
in a case like this, Niles.

10:19.919 --> 10:23.685
It's impossible to pinpoint
any one cause in particular.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.660
Why are you dressed
like that?

10:27.660 --> 10:28.649
Hmm?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.963
.
Well, uh..

10:30.963 --> 10:32.665
Oh, all right.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.656
You remember my patient
with the clown phobia?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.662
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.833
Oh, Niles.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.138
I feel just terrible
about this.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.640
Frasier, you
feel terrible--

10:40.640 --> 10:42.642
I was supposed to have
dinner with him tonight

10:42.642 --> 10:43.631
and I canceled on him.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.645
I would have been there
when it happened,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.414
but no, I had to try out
those new bath emollients.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.950
There's no point
in trying to assign blame

10:50.950 --> 10:52.815
.
at a time like this, Niles

10:53.085 --> 10:55.053
We must remember that.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.889
You probably
saved his life.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.159
Our father had
a heart attack.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.922
This man
saved his life.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.196
Well, I'm sure you would
have done the same thing

11:04.196 --> 11:05.831
if you were in
my shoes, Niles.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.868
Well, not these
shoes, of course.

11:08.868 --> 11:09.766
(chuckles)

11:10.102 --> 11:10.932
Hey.

11:11.137 --> 11:11.694
Oh, Roz, hi.

11:12.171 --> 11:12.660
Here are your clothes.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.674
ad?
Thank you.
How's your d

11:14.674 --> 11:16.665
He's fine now,
thanks to Frasier's
grace under pressure.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.040
MAN:
You know, they say

11:18.411 --> 11:20.446
the first few minutes
are critical.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.936
Did you give him
an aspirin?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.406
Uh... yes, I did.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.352
He's been taking care
of his dad for ten years.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.842
God bless him.
What a good son.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.290
Uh, excuse me,
Dr. Crane.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.281
I have to verify
the paramedics' report.

11:33.793 --> 11:34.782
Around 7:00 this evening

11:35.294 --> 11:37.296
you pretended to leave
your apartment...

11:37.296 --> 11:39.298
Yes, that's right.
It's all there.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.299
.
Off you go

11:40.299 --> 11:41.288
Then you dressed up
like a clown

11:41.801 --> 11:43.302
and lured your father
into the living room

11:43.302 --> 11:45.805
where you leapt out
waving a meat cleaver

11:45.805 --> 11:47.796
causing him to collapse.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.712
You scared him on purpose?

11:57.149 --> 11:58.184
It was a joke.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.186
You know how much
he hates clowns.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.744
My father hates clowns.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.785
Yes, well, it was only meant
as a playful little jolt.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.949
Why didn't you just
throw a toaster in his tub?

12:09.128 --> 12:09.924
Dr. Crane.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.026
Oh, yes.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.364
Your father's doing well.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.229
He appears to have suffered
a mild cardiac event.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.202
?
.
And what
does that mean exactly

12:16.202 --> 12:17.066
Basically,
it's a warning.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.801
He'll need to change
his diet, start exercising.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.439
Anyway, he should be able
to go home tomorrow.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.739
What relief.
He's going to be okay.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.005
No thanks to you.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.812
NILES:
Look at you.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.848
You just stand there
with a smile on your face.

12:28.848 --> 12:31.316
That's makeup, you idiot.

12:32.918 --> 12:37.753
May I remind you all
that this was an accident.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.059
It was meant as
a harmless amusement.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.062
I will not stand here
and be demonized for this.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.757
!
.
I am not a monster

12:45.064 --> 12:47.760
)
(screaming

12:47.867 --> 12:50.427
(screaming continues)

12:58.978 --> 13:01.847
Okay, Dad, just
take it easy.

13:01.847 --> 13:02.836
I'm fine.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.140
Hey, there's my guy.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.087
Daddy's home fro
m the little vacation

13:08.087 --> 13:10.790
your brother Frasier
sent me on.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.792
All right, Dad.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.094
Daphne's on her way over
to join us

13:15.094 --> 13:17.096
for a nice
heart-smart dinner.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.099
Oh, and, Dad, you really
should take a look

13:20.099 --> 13:22.966
at this list the hospital
sent home with us.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.337
Now, the foods that have
a little picture

13:25.337 --> 13:28.795
of a smiling heart next to them
are good for you.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.442
Yeah, I cracked
that code already.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.945
Frasier, I wish you'd
stop coddling me.

13:32.945 --> 13:33.934
I know you're sorry

13:34.446 --> 13:35.310
and you didn't mean
to give me a heart attack.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.116
Not a heart attack, Dad.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.344
A cardiac event.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.520
You know, maybe we can
look on this as a sign

13:41.520 --> 13:44.023
that you should begin
a healthier lifestyle.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.025
Perhaps one day
we'll look back on this

13:46.025 --> 13:47.390
it.
and you'll thank me for

13:47.860 --> 13:48.918
NILES:
Oh, yes.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.964
Maybe then you can find
a nice card for Frasier

13:51.964 --> 13:54.300
Iike, "Now that I'm old
and looking back,

13:54.300 --> 13:55.961
I thank you for
my heart attack. "

13:56.268 --> 13:58.236
Cardiac event.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.105
.
Here. Give me
this, will you

14:00.105 --> 14:02.596
No, Dad, here,
I'll take this
in your room for you.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.099
Why don't you just
go sit down and rest.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.513
Were you able to reach
Ronee at her mom's?
No.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.502
Well, here,
you can try now.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.242
No, because
I'm not telling her.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.517
What?

14:12.918 --> 14:14.286
She doesn't need to know
every little thing

14:14.286 --> 14:15.184
that goes on in my life.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.088
Dad, you had
a heart attack.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.959
Cardiac event.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.994
And it's over.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.087
- Dad...
- It's over.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.465
Dad, are you afraid

14:26.465 --> 14:27.454
she'll start seeing
you differently?

14:27.967 --> 14:28.968
Well, you see
me differently.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.458
"Let me have that
suitcase, Dad. "

14:30.970 --> 14:32.471
"Just sit down and rest. "

14:32.471 --> 14:35.463
I don't need her thinking
of me as some feeble old guy.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.068
Do you really want to keep such
an enormous secret from her?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.945
Well, not forever.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.106
You and Niles can tell her
after I'm dead.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.415
(doorbell ringing)

14:43.415 --> 14:44.917
Oh, that'll be Daphne.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.407
She's not
cooking, is she?

14:46.919 --> 14:48.409
I just got out
of the hospital.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.025
Ronee.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.161
Surprise, boys.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.664
?
.
And start pouring.
How you doing, sweetie

14:58.664 --> 15:01.166
.
Hey. Thought you were at your mother's

15:01.166 --> 15:02.668
Oh, you know,
I cut it short.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.169
.
It was just too depressing

15:04.169 --> 15:06.160
Every since her operation,
she just sits around all day

15:06.672 --> 15:07.661
Iike she's a hundred.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.243
Nice flowers.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.945
"Get well soon"?

15:12.945 --> 15:15.247
Oh, I got those for Frasier.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.942
He has a little...

15:17.249 --> 15:18.944
man problem.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.547
Flares up every
once in a while.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.982
(laughing):
Frasier has a man problem.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.595
Shut up, you nit.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.367
Hey, thank God
for antibiotics, huh?

15:35.367 --> 15:38.370
I'll be right back,
and then you want to go out

15:38.370 --> 15:40.072
and get some ribs?

15:40.072 --> 15:41.266
Ribs sounds great.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.497
her.
Well, I'm not telling

15:44.009 --> 15:46.068
You heard what she said about her mother.

15:47.646 --> 15:48.510
Watch me.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.082
And how are you going
to explain the fact

15:50.082 --> 15:51.383
that you can't eat ribs tonight

15:51.383 --> 15:52.281
or the new medication
that you're on

15:52.518 --> 15:53.576
or the fact that you
can't have sex

15:54.019 --> 15:55.020
?
.
for the next two weeks

15:55.020 --> 15:56.385
.
Who says?
It's on the list

15:56.689 --> 15:59.249
What little picture
is next to that one?

16:03.495 --> 16:04.985
Dad...

16:05.497 --> 16:10.502
Listen, if she's not able
to handle something like this,

16:10.502 --> 16:12.993
isn't it better
if you know now?

16:16.175 --> 16:18.405
Okay, Marty,
let's go pig out.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.347
Niles, help me put this stuff away, will you?

16:21.347 --> 16:23.042
Good seeing you again, Ronee.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.078
Yeah, you, too, and I'm glad
you're feeling better.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.146
Sorry?

16:26.385 --> 16:27.249
.
You know, your man problem

16:27.653 --> 16:29.188
!
.
Ha

16:29.188 --> 16:32.055
FRASIER:
Keep laughing, you're going
to have a man problem.

16:32.424 --> 16:36.028
You know, I'm not
that hungry right now.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.188
Do you mind if we
just sit for awhile?

16:37.596 --> 16:38.597
No, no, it's fine.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.189
You want me to go
get you a beer?

16:40.332 --> 16:42.368
No, thanks.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.359
So, uh...

16:45.070 --> 16:47.368
did you have good weather
over there in Spokane?

16:48.073 --> 16:50.075
Oh, God, it rained
the entire time.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.377
I basically just sat there

16:51.377 --> 16:54.079
and made boring small talk
with my mother.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.070
God, I hate small talk.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.077
Oh, tell me.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.077
Rained here some, too.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.083
know.
I don't

17:10.596 --> 17:13.098
I just hope it doesn't scare her off.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.099
Maybe she'll surprise us.

17:15.099 --> 17:18.092
Does Ronee ever spend
the night here?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.039
Yeah, on occasion.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.438
Oh, good. 'Cause there's
some underwear in this drawer

17:22.141 --> 17:24.132
I was really hoping
didn't belong to Dad.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.542
Oh, look at this.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.552
fun.
Dad was right-- we're
camping and we're having

17:33.552 --> 17:35.042
Look how happy we are.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.048
No, the car's packed.
We're leaving.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.562
God, what pains we were.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.564
Didn't want to get
our hands dirty,

17:45.564 --> 17:47.099
didn't want to go fishing,

17:47.099 --> 17:49.068
didn't want to sleep
on the ground,

17:49.068 --> 17:50.569
but he kept taking us...

17:50.569 --> 17:54.061
year after year just
so he could spend time with us.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.541
And frighten us to death

17:55.541 --> 17:58.243
with stories
of hook-armed slashers.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.546
You know, no matter
how frightened I got,

18:00.546 --> 18:03.082
as soon as Dad started
laughing again,

18:03.082 --> 18:05.073
I knew that everything was safe.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.751
I'm not ready
to lose him, Niles.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.589
Me neither.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.093
And I don't want my
child to miss knowing him.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.393
Who else is going to teach him
how to catch a football ball?

18:25.571 --> 18:28.574
You know, 1 1 years ago
when he moved in here,

18:28.574 --> 18:31.276
I couldn't imagine
a bigger infringement

18:31.276 --> 18:33.278
.
on my life

18:33.278 --> 18:38.580
Now... I can't imagine
my life without him.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.421
It would be very hard
to walk into this apartment

18:42.421 --> 18:44.116
and see that chair...

18:46.258 --> 18:48.226
and know that Dad
wasn't here anymore.

18:48.527 --> 18:51.519
Oh, I'd get rid
of that chair immediately.

18:54.566 --> 18:59.138
So you made it from Spokane
on one tank? Wow.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.808
Yeah, that was really
one for the books.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.810
Okay, Marty,
what's going on?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.311
What?

19:06.311 --> 19:08.336
Well, I feel like you have
something on your mind

19:08.780 --> 19:09.644
me.
that you're not telling

19:10.182 --> 19:11.583
No, I don't.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.642
..
It's just.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.458
Boy, this is hard.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.327
say.
I'm just nervous about
what you're going to

19:22.327 --> 19:23.328
Marty, just...

19:23.328 --> 19:26.331
,
Yesterday I had a mild

19:26.331 --> 19:29.334
very mild cardiac event.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.801
A what?

19:35.741 --> 19:38.608
I had a little heart attack.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.475
And that's it?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.319
What do you mean, that's it?

19:47.319 --> 19:49.321
I had a heart attack, for God's sake!

19:49.321 --> 19:50.622
No surgery,
home the next day.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.324
That's a bee sting.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.189
.
Did they use the paddles?
No

19:54.359 --> 19:56.759
.
Well, talk to me after
they've used the paddles

19:59.198 --> 20:00.699
You had the paddles?

20:00.699 --> 20:04.703
Let's just say I didn't have
the best lipo guy.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.206
Well, I'm sorry if it'
s not dramatic enough for you.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.708
Look, after all that buildup
I just thought it would be

20:09.708 --> 20:11.198
something bigger, you know,

20:11.710 --> 20:13.712
Iike you were going
to break up with me

20:13.712 --> 20:15.202
or pop the question
or something.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.683
And FYI, the next time
you're in the hospital,

20:17.683 --> 20:20.243
I would appreciate a phone call,
if it's not too much trouble.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.578
.
Fine. And FYI, I'm
not breaking up with you

20:22.988 --> 20:23.977
Well, I know that now.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.081
And if I was going to do
that other thing,

20:26.491 --> 20:27.492
it wouldn't be here.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.493
What other thing?

20:28.493 --> 20:29.494
Pop the question.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.996
Oh.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.486
sake.
It'd be someplace
romantic, for God's

20:32.998 --> 20:35.000
Tablecloths.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.501
Nice.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.492
nice.
Damn right
it'd be

20:40.505 --> 20:41.473
So?

20:41.473 --> 20:42.474
So what?

20:42.474 --> 20:43.976
So what would
you have said ?

20:43.976 --> 20:45.978
How should I know?
You didn't ask me.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.412
So say I am now.

20:47.412 --> 20:47.969
.
What?
Asking you

20:48.513 --> 20:49.514
Well, are you
or aren't you?

20:49.514 --> 20:50.515
am.
I

20:50.515 --> 20:51.516
Okay then.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.018
Okay.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.354
?
.
Okay, what

20:55.354 --> 20:56.755
Okay, I will.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.423
Yeah ?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.358
Yeah.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.425
Okay.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.722
Okay.

21:07.466 --> 21:08.867
Maybe Dad's right.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.370
I'm getting
stuck in my ways.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.862
I like the way things are.
I don't want them to change.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.375
Well, don't worry.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.377
He's not going
anywhere for awhile.

21:18.377 --> 21:21.380
Hey, guys, guess what.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.371
I'm getting married!
