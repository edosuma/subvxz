WEBVTT

00:07.477 --> 00:09.105
And here at this site,

00:09.179 --> 00:12.048
my Great-uncle Gumbald cut
down all these taffy trees in

00:12.116 --> 00:13.516
a single night.

00:13.584 --> 00:15.554
'Cause those trees were evil!

00:15.621 --> 00:17.089
Right, Princess Bubblegum?

00:17.156 --> 00:18.021
Nah.

00:18.090 --> 00:19.650
Hey, but I bet you
have a ton of stories

00:19.726 --> 00:21.661
about your human relatives.

00:21.728 --> 00:23.493
Um, not really.

00:23.564 --> 00:25.931
I've never even met
any other humans.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.469
If I think about it too much,

00:27.536 --> 00:31.599
<i>I get all soul-searchy
and weird.</i>

00:31.674 --> 00:32.903
Oh, my.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.443
I've made things awkward.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.605
Well, let's forget about that.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.857
I brought you guys here because

00:37.881 --> 00:40.442
I need you to rip out
all these stumps.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.578
Okay. I guess so.

00:42.654 --> 00:43.486
Yeah, man!

00:43.556 --> 00:44.649
It'll be fun!

00:44.724 --> 00:46.625
Toss the Jake-sploder!

00:46.692 --> 00:48.127
Ye-e-ah!

00:48.195 --> 00:49.493
Whoa!

00:49.563 --> 00:50.622
Spa-mow!

00:50.697 --> 00:52.496
I'm glad to see you
out of that funk

00:52.567 --> 00:54.559
about being the only human.

00:54.635 --> 00:56.901
I mean, well, I'm gonna scram.

00:56.972 --> 00:58.304
No hard feelings, right?

00:58.374 --> 01:01.106
- Again, man!
- Huck!

01:01.177 --> 01:02.270
Ow!

01:02.345 --> 01:03.507
Whoa.

01:03.581 --> 01:05.550
I don't think this is a stump.

01:05.616 --> 01:07.779
Huh?

01:07.853 --> 01:08.786
It's a hatch.

01:08.854 --> 01:09.787
A hatch?

01:09.855 --> 01:11.222
Hup!

01:12.258 --> 01:13.624
We should check
it out, ya think?

01:13.693 --> 01:15.094
Who-o-a!

01:15.162 --> 01:16.162
Heh, heh.

01:19.401 --> 01:21.063
It's dark, huh?

01:26.142 --> 01:27.142
Whoa!

01:27.210 --> 01:29.509
What a dump.

01:29.579 --> 01:32.175
Can you imagine the jerks
that must have lived here?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.116
Huh?

01:34.185 --> 01:35.779
Aah! Aah!

01:35.854 --> 01:37.152
Ohh!

01:38.123 --> 01:39.524
Eh! Wee meeb youp nuh hur!

01:42.162 --> 01:43.426
Oh!

01:48.370 --> 01:49.497
Shahow!

01:50.539 --> 01:52.202
O my gra cup sa!

01:53.910 --> 01:56.471
These people are so terrified...

01:56.547 --> 01:58.277
scared of their own shadows.

01:58.348 --> 02:01.148
We could rule them like gods.

02:01.219 --> 02:03.314
Angry gods.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.389
Don't be scared.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.891
Come on.

02:05.958 --> 02:10.727
Yeah, it's okay.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.562
Your... your face.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.625
You're... just like me!

02:14.702 --> 02:16.934
Aah!

02:17.005 --> 02:18.166
Hey, wait.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.539
Shh.

02:19.609 --> 02:20.838
They're startled.

02:20.910 --> 02:23.278
You got to be gentle
with wild animals.

02:23.347 --> 02:25.373
I don't think they're
animals, Jake.

02:25.449 --> 02:29.046
I think this could
be a tribe of...

02:29.120 --> 02:30.987
humans!

02:31.958 --> 02:34.553
What are these guys doing down
here in this crummy hole?

02:34.627 --> 02:35.493
I don't know, man.

02:35.562 --> 02:37.588
Maybe they just don't
know any other thing.

02:37.664 --> 02:38.688
Hey, fellows!

02:38.765 --> 02:40.166
Don't you want to
get out of here?

02:40.235 --> 02:43.536
I could take you to see the sun!

02:43.606 --> 02:45.199
Su-u-n.

02:45.274 --> 02:46.833

02:52.316 --> 02:54.717
Living down here has made
you all weird, hasn't it?

02:57.322 --> 02:59.554
Jake, I've got to
save these guys.

02:59.626 --> 03:02.391
They're my people, and it's my
duty to lead them out of this

03:02.462 --> 03:04.455
gross cave, starting with you,

03:04.532 --> 03:06.000
Miss, uh...?

03:06.066 --> 03:08.798

03:33.734 --> 03:35.174
There's all sorts
of wonders topside.

03:37.172 --> 03:38.606
Uh! Ugh!

03:38.674 --> 03:41.201
Susan, it's just grass.

03:42.879 --> 03:44.212
Ooh! My back!

03:44.281 --> 03:45.874
Grass can't hurt you.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.146
See?

03:47.218 --> 03:48.242
Grass.

03:49.287 --> 03:51.314
Huh, huh, oh.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.552
Eh, you killed her.

03:53.626 --> 03:54.626
Wha? I did?

03:54.694 --> 03:57.688
Yep. Felled by
surface-world germs.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.327
Heh, just kidding.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.142
Yeep! Itsa pha tuh mup!

04:14.218 --> 04:17.279
Susan, a hanky won't hurt you.

04:17.356 --> 04:18.688
Ohh.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.670
How am I gonna show her
all the wonders of Ooo

04:21.694 --> 04:23.493

freaks her out?

04:23.564 --> 04:24.964
"Pay-shonce."

04:25.032 --> 04:25.931
Very well.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.439
Then I shall introduce
Susan to Ooo by degrees.

04:34.744 --> 04:36.509
Manee mah nuhp lehp!

04:36.580 --> 04:38.048
That can't hurt you.

That's a dancing bug.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.178
Oh.

04:43.622 --> 04:45.250
Yeah!

04:47.994 --> 04:49.462
That's just a rock,

04:49.529 --> 04:50.827
a low-level enemy.

04:50.897 --> 04:51.897
Huh.

04:51.932 --> 04:53.025
Jus a rah.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.591

Golden as a wheaty sunset.

06:08.628 --> 06:09.628
How's yours?

06:28.386 --> 06:29.979
She is way in to candy.

06:30.054 --> 06:31.079
Hey, yeah.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.490
Susan, we should take you
to the Candy Kingdom.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.188
Everything is candy there.

06:35.262 --> 06:38.130
You know, she may be too
excited about candy.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.198
Eh.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.903
Candy-y-y Kingdo-o-m!

06:46.008 --> 06:50.310
I've enjoyed your visit
immensely, Susan Strong.

06:51.649 --> 06:52.480
Finn?

06:52.550 --> 06:53.415
Yeah, Suze?

06:53.484 --> 06:56.751
Finn, where's all the

06:56.822 --> 06:57.881
Oh, well,

The buildings,

06:59.892 --> 07:01.952
the lamp posts, even the people.

07:02.028 --> 07:04.089
We're all candy here.

07:04.164 --> 07:05.757
Candy! Candy!

07:07.468 --> 07:08.800
Susan!

07:10.104 --> 07:11.801
Su-san! No!

07:11.874 --> 07:13.638
You can't eat the
ones that talk.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.042
They're special.

07:15.111 --> 07:16.477
They got aspirations.

07:16.546 --> 07:18.845
Oh. Oh.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.282
It's okay.

07:20.351 --> 07:21.649
You're learning.

07:21.719 --> 07:22.618
Here.

07:22.687 --> 07:24.213
Have some sidewalk
brittle instead.

07:27.093 --> 07:29.358
Mmm!

07:29.429 --> 07:32.457
Now I gonna get friends.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.900
We eat all of candy kingdom.

07:34.970 --> 07:35.970
What?!

07:36.004 --> 07:37.802
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:37.873 --> 07:42.335
We won't eat red-stripe
man, only everyone else.

07:42.411 --> 07:43.675
Bye!

07:43.747 --> 07:45.477
Susan, no!

07:46.483 --> 07:47.713
Huh! No!!

07:47.785 --> 07:49.549
You can't eat the candy people!

07:51.357 --> 07:52.586
Oh, boy.

07:52.658 --> 07:53.717
So, now what?

07:53.792 --> 07:55.728
Fight the humans to the
death when they attack?

07:55.795 --> 07:56.660
No, man.

07:56.730 --> 07:57.823
They're my peeps.

07:57.898 --> 07:59.458
We have to save
the Candy Kingdom

07:59.533 --> 08:00.933
without hurting them.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.197
They're gonna what?

08:02.270 --> 08:03.933
Don't worry. We have a plan.

08:04.006 --> 08:06.271
We just have to scare
the humans away.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.674
Very well.

08:07.744 --> 08:10.407
I shall gather my citizens
in the courtyard,

08:10.480 --> 08:16.217
and you shall see how terrifying
the candy people can be.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.881
Ah-bloo-bloo-bloo!

08:18.958 --> 08:21.086
They're doomed.

08:23.697 --> 08:24.630
Ughhh!

08:24.698 --> 08:26.428
Oh!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.800
Just grass!

08:28.870 --> 08:31.739
Just graaa.

08:31.807 --> 08:34.743
Aw, these candy weapons
are too cute to be scary.

08:34.809 --> 08:35.972
Good news, Finn.

08:36.046 --> 08:39.245
I've managed to make
my people horrifying.

08:39.317 --> 08:40.784
But how?

08:40.851 --> 08:42.980
I disguised them as
gruesome creatures,

08:43.054 --> 08:44.990
like witches and ghouls.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.719
Starchie's a beelzebub.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.455
Aww, so cute.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.930
I just want to give them candy.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.031
Quick!

08:54.101 --> 08:55.161
Show me your scary face!

08:55.236 --> 08:57.432
Oh, uh... rrr.

08:57.505 --> 08:59.498
I don't think that'll
scare anybody.

08:59.575 --> 09:00.508
No! Duh!

09:00.576 --> 09:03.206
She's, um... she... hey.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.272
Princess, I need a little wagon

09:05.349 --> 09:07.148
and your biggest
roll of wax paper.

09:09.354 --> 09:11.119
Now, Princess Bubblegum!

09:12.391 --> 09:14.417
Now, Jake!

09:14.493 --> 09:16.224
Boooooooo!

09:19.033 --> 09:20.865
It's working.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.132
Wait! Just shadows!

09:23.205 --> 09:24.229
Aw, man!

09:24.306 --> 09:25.569
They've learned how to learn.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.041
Hide yourselves, candy people.

09:27.110 --> 09:29.238
I'll try to make
Susan see reason.

09:29.312 --> 09:30.746
Fwoo-fwoo-fwoof!

09:30.813 --> 09:33.784
The marshmallow kids
never run from a scrap.

09:33.851 --> 09:34.875
Come on, fellas.

09:34.953 --> 09:37.252
Today we are man-mallows!

09:38.924 --> 09:39.983
Fwoo!

09:40.059 --> 09:41.152
Huh?

09:41.227 --> 09:42.559
Please, fellow humans.

09:42.628 --> 09:44.894
The candy people are
no threat to you.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.627
Charge!

09:46.700 --> 09:48.169
Wait! Stop!

09:48.236 --> 09:50.637
Stop!

09:50.705 --> 09:52.334
Ohh!

09:52.408 --> 09:53.637
My people!

09:54.944 --> 09:56.276
Huh?

09:57.313 --> 09:58.508
Huh?

09:59.550 --> 10:00.550
Wha?

10:03.021 --> 10:06.617
They're... they're not humans?

10:09.128 --> 10:12.429
Susan?

10:12.499 --> 10:15.299
Susan, what are you?
