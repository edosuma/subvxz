01:56.000 --> 01:59.924
Find and destroy what stands in the way.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.924
Grandfather?

04:20.899 --> 04:23.824
This makes you weak.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.924
Come.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.924
I saved this for you.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.924
What is it?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.924
A gift.

05:11.100 --> 05:15.924
That amulet is dangerous,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.924
and powerful.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.924
Things change.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.999
A darkness covered the land.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.924
Can not be reversed soon.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.999
The bad is coming from the east.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.999
What will it do us?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.924
The people trying to dominate ...

05:46.000 --> 05:47.924
them to bend,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.924
for his perversity.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.724
Grandfather.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.924
Rachek. My friend.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.999
Arkadi, get some wood for the fire.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.924
Yes, grandfather.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.999
The Red Sun

06:24.000 --> 06:25.999
You can not ignore the forecast.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.924
I know the better prediction
as someone else.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.999
The boy is not ready.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.924
We have no other defense.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.924
The Brotherhood will never accept.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.924
They should, Kirill is stronger every day.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.924
The boy is not ready.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.224
Your pride can not change his fate.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.924
Your failure is not his.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.999
Let him go.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.924
I can not.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.924
Arkadi, go back to the house.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.999
The village is on fire.
We must help them.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.924
The gift that I have given,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.924
should the stones Artu
to be placed.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.924
If I return tomorrow.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.999
To the east, the army job.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.924
Until you reach the tower of Ronbruck.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.924
Look for Maxim,
an old warrior.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.224
He will explain everything.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.624
Rachek, until the boy.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.624
Grandfather.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.924
Arkadi, dive!

09:14.000 --> 09:16.924
Grandfather no!
Arise!

09:18.000 --> 09:24.124
Go! Do as I could.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.924
Grandfather no!
Taci!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.999
Listen!

09:37.000 --> 09:39.924
Find Maxim.
Trust him.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.924
Go! Go! Go!

10:12.000 --> 10:16.924
Let him go.
The boy is not ready.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.924
My men will defend.
They can not protect the west walls.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.024
The king should act.
And he will do.

10:56.025 --> 10:58.125
Tovar is not alone.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.224
What is it?

11:01.300 --> 11:03.924
Grandfather is dead.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.924
We have confidence in a guy.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.999
Who is the boy?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.924
I can not say.
Its mission is to remain secret.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.924
Call the townspeople together.
I care for mine.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.924
Our people are now safe.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.924
It is not long until the dragon returns.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.924
Tell the King.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.924
We must give our Guardian some time.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.999
Sir ...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.924
the Keeper is sent.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.924
Then it's time friend.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.924
The red sun marks our end.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.724
But we can not have our Lord
confidence in a boy lay.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.999
We have no choice.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.999
We can at least ...

12:16.000 --> 12:18.924
My whole life I have one
kingdom built.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.924
I have protected the West.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.924
And now, the appreciation of our
world from a boy

12:28.000 --> 12:30.224
But surely Lord.
My men are ready to ride tomorrow.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.924
Yes, my Lord.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.424
Kiril Lord, may I speak.
The king arrives tomorrow morning.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.924
The Grandfather has chosen the Keeper.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.999
My Lord,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.924
The boy brings news of the enemy.

13:47.000 --> 13:47.999
Your majesty, I am by Arkady Tovar.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.999
Who sent you?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.999
Grandfather ...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.924
before he died.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.924
You may leave us.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.924
Where did you say, you're sent Grandfather.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.924
To Ronbruck
Maxim to find.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.924
Then my men
this pass defense.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.924
We will keep him
as long as we can.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.924
Make haste.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.924
The enemy is approaching us quickly.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.924
You need to Ronbruck flights.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.924
We will continue.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.924
Forward march!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.924
Forward!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.924
Connect with me.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.924
I will not be your slave.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.924
Why destroy everything you built.
Why give up your kingdom?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.999
Why do you force your people to such fate.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.999
Let them live!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.224
You will not break my spirit.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.699
Idiot.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.500
Where is the Keeper?

16:54.550 --> 16:56.500
For the Keeper!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.500
For Humanity!

18:28.000 --> 18:30.924
What's in the bag, boy?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.624
Tea Leaves.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.025
Teas.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.924
You know who we are?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.924
We Tovar.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.924
And we take what we want.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.999
Not worth fighting for a mercenary.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.999
Wait.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.999
Where you going?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.924
My name is Arkady,
I'm looking for Ronbruck.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.999
Ronbruck belongs to Tovar mercenaries ...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.924
wise if you returns home.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.924
Wait.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.924
Go home.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.924
I have no home.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.924
Destroyed.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.999
I can not help you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.924
Looking for Maxim.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.924
Who sent you?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.924
Grandfather.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.924
I know your name.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.924
Katya.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.924
Katya?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.924
The Guardian.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.924
Maxim?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.999
For centuries,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.924
harmony was held by
a group of monks ...

21:46.000 --> 21:47.924
... called the Brotherhood.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.999
She loved the truth.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.924
and science.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.924
She studied virtue.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.924
Everyone except one.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.999
Kirill.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.999
For him,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.999
harmony was not enough.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.924
He left the Order ...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.924
and became a master of dark arts.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.324
He stole the stone Antiphises,
a great force against virtue.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.924
A major threat to humanity.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.924
So ...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.924
... the leader of the Order,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.924
banished the apostate.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.999
He foresaw the virtue of the stone,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.924
ancient relics of unprecedented knowledge.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.924
He had success and found the
stone of patience,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.924
vigilance and abstinence.,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.924
calmness, generosity and kindness.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.924
But his name was announced ...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.924
grabbed his heart and pride.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.924
He was blind,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.924
the greatest gift of all:

23:17.000 --> 23:18.924
humanity.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.924
Thus shirk his duties.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.924
In science

23:31.000 --> 23:32.924
he ...

23:33.000 --> 23:35.924
someone prepared ...

23:37.000 --> 23:38.924
to succeed

23:40.500 --> 23:43.209
where he failed.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.909
Are you listening?
-Yes

23:48.200 --> 23:49.909
I listened.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.924
But I do not know what this
me to do.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.924
You're a great honor conferred.
Why not take that seriously?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.924
Because nobody asked me.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.924
You must succeed.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.999
If you fail

24:05.000 --> 24:07.924
will destroy you seen
have total.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.924
The whole world will perish in flames.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.924
How can the stones of virtue
beat the dragon?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.924
Excuse me ...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.924
What am I doing?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.924
Never turn your back on an enemy.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.924
Why did not Grandfather
I was a Keeper?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.924
Because you

25:43.000 --> 25:45.924
not finished.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.999
He said I was weak.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.924
Then his evidence to the contrary.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.999
A good idea,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.924
We start here.

26:02.100 --> 26:07.024
Have you ever learned from
a blind man to fight?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.224
You will learn to think,

26:28.400 --> 26:30.999
you will learn to fight,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.924
and you will learn the proper respect.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.924
They will first test.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.924
You will learn the power ...

26:49.000 --> 26:51.924
of patience.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.924
Where are we heading?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.999
What we are is just as important ...

27:18.000 --> 27:20.924
as we go.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.924
Tell me something.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.224
By the time the stone back
in the Brotherhood,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.924
They have lost their power.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.924
They should be together,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.924
not separately.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.924
The first stone was lost here.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.924
So all I do is here
go and tackle the stone?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.924
Is that all?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.924
How hard can it be?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.924
The stone?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.924
You can not succeed if you do not
by the rules of virtue.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.924
Control your power.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.924
Well, one idiot took power.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.024
But this is only the first step.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.924
You have knowledge of the Keeper.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.924
Now!

33:48.000 --> 33:48.999
Tell me his name.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.924
Leave me!

33:52.000 --> 33:53.999
Tell me where he is.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.924
Leave me.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.024
Tell me his name!

34:01.300 --> 34:02.324
Breathe in obscurity.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.924
Let it consume you.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.924
I listen.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.924
His name is Arkady.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.424
It is led by a knight
of the Brotherhood.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.724
He follows the river to the east,
through the valley.

35:15.000 --> 35:15.999
Can I ask you something?

35:16.000 --> 35:16.999
What?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.924
Why I am the Keeper?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.924
Just because my Grandfather chose?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.924
Is not that enough?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.999
Why he chose me?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.924
You ask many questions.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.999
Why are you not the Keeper?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.924
Because I was not chosen.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.924
You're not what I expected.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.924
Then, help me.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.924
Can I ask you,
I want this.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.924
The sun is in motion.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.924
We would also have.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.924
Young man?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.924
Hedona, my beloved ...

36:48.000 --> 36:49.924
you know I am older ...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.999
or whose children have kids.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.924
Young Timmy!

36:59.000 --> 37:01.924
Hello, Hedona.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.924
Long ago.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.924
And who is this being pretty?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.524
We have a lot of lilies
need in your bathtub, tonight.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.724
Come.

37:30.425 --> 37:36.525
My beloved is necessary,
He will shudder as the flames cut back ...

37:37.396 --> 37:40.147
He will have to move to stay warm.

37:58.730 --> 38:02.230
Each of the stones has a
specic place in the amulet.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.999
What is that?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.924
This?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.924
I already know I long.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.924
The bath is ready.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.299
Arkani, I will help you.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.924
Do not be shy.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.999
I made this for you.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.924
It is hot.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.924
Sorry.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.924
I can not.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.924
You still stink.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.924
I know.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.924
So fast, Maxim.

40:33.200 --> 40:33.899
Hedona.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.324
Dear, dear children.

40:42.700 --> 40:47.424
Young man I got something for you.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.724
You've earned it.

41:03.825 --> 41:06.425
You are driven,
but you're a good boy.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.324
Very respected.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.924
What do you want?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.999
The Guardian must be stopped.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.999
How?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.924
Win his heart, his mind bending ...

41:52.000 --> 41:53.999
crushing his strength.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.924
Yes Lord.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.924
Good morning my friend.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.924
The bed is not soft,
but meets the toilet.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.924
Where are we?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.199
In the forest.

43:32.300 --> 43:35.324
Prisoners of Tovar.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.524
I Arkadi.

43:46.025 --> 43:47.725
Superboy, hé.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.924
You may call me ..

43:51.000 --> 43:52.924
Stranger.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.924
Do you have news of King agmar?

44:01.325 --> 44:03.125
You said the king.

44:04.000 --> 44:04.999
Yes.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.924
He and his army are dead.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.524
Slain by Tovar,
and the dragon.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.999
Kirill ...

44:26.000 --> 44:28.924
He once belonged to the Brotherhood ...

44:29.000 --> 44:31.924
let rise until the dragon.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.999
He crushed the Brotherhood,
He and his evil men.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.999
His army was ...

44:36.000 --> 44:38.924
and destroyed everything the Brotherhood

44:39.000 --> 44:40.924
and bosmensen had made.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.924
The community they had built ...

44:45.000 --> 44:48.524
knowledge, confidence and wisdom.
And .. and freedom.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.924
You're crazy.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.924
You're not my friend.

47:39.100 --> 47:40.699
Get up.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.999
I'm not going sideways for goats.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.924
I said, get up, get up.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.924
I have the keys.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.924
Beware.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.924
Come with me.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.924
This way, this.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.924
Come on, quickly.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.924
Now is no need to
call me stranger.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.224
We have expelled Tovar.
For here.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.924
And if you ...

49:16.000 --> 49:18.924
I reward you,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.924
with a part of our treasure.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.924
With this I can buy Tovar,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.924
for your amulet.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.924
Thank you

49:53.000 --> 49:55.924
The dragon, go, go, everybody.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.924
The dragon has burned everything ...

50:22.000 --> 50:26.024
all villages along the river.,
between here and Sulvan.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.924
He seeks something.

50:29.925 --> 50:34.725
The Tovar follow him and fall
what they encounter

50:35.000 --> 50:37.924
There is a town in the east,
not affected.

50:38.025 --> 50:39.425
We warn them.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.999
Go you.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.999
I can help.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.924
We are always the weakest,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.924
if we feel the strongest.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.924
No, we will go.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.924
You should go on this way,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.924
until you have found shelter.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.924
You will know.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.924
We will join with you.
Show us this way.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.424
Katya, tell them.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.999
What took you so long.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.924
You make jokes.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.999
Do you know what is in the cave?

55:19.000 --> 55:20.999
I know.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.924
Many people have been felled in that cave.

55:31.500 --> 55:35.924
But not the Keeper.
- Let go.

56:29.000 --> 56:29.999
Are you OK?

56:30.000 --> 56:33.224
My village.
Everything is gone.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.924
Bread, quick.

56:43.000 --> 56:43.999
Eat this.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.999
Thank you, thank you

56:46.000 --> 56:47.999
There is a place not far from here.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.924
Can you walk?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.924
Come on, get up.

56:57.000 --> 56:57.999
You need that way, on the mountain.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.924
You meet the others.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.924
They have nothing, but you're not alone.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.924
Good luck.
Thank-you

57:16.025 --> 57:17.025
Wait!

57:24.000 --> 57:26.924
Take this.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.924
Share it with others.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.924
This was the wise man in the village ..

57:40.000 --> 57:41.924
It belongs to him by virtue searches.

57:47.625 --> 57:49.025
Thank you.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.924
I sense change.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.924
Stop.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.924
Peaceful friend.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.024
Remember him?

58:24.200 --> 58:26.899
Yes, he is from my village.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.959
Yes, yes you're Grandfather 's boy.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.959
I'm Anson.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.959
You may be a hot meal and
some drinking.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.959
He will do well.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.524
Who is he?

58:47.625 --> 58:50.825
A noble man, a friend of Angmar.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.924
A friend of everyone.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.924
Arkadi.

58:58.000 --> 58:58.999
Yes.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.924
There is not much time.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.924
But we must still make a camp.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.999
A good night sleep and hot food.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.224
Then we suited for the trip.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.924
Go.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.999
You've proven that you have virtue.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.924
Remember ...

59:22.000 --> 59:24.924
too much confidence in yourself,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.924
the end of virtue.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.924
Arkadi, come.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.924
Are you not?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.924
We will come there.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.924
Thank you

59:46.000 --> 59:49.004
Certainly are dark days,
as a man to use violence

59:49.010 --> 59:50.504
to have a hot meal,
and a drink.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.924
And you have not yet met the women.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.999
Come bedtime.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.424
Perhaps, I can sleep tonight.
Your strong stories fill my dreams.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.924
Good night.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.924
It is amazing that you've come so far.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.324
I know who you are.

01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:36.025
I pretended I knew nothing

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.999
Grandfather told me everything.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:39.999
You're it ...

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.924
Such power and yet so young.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:45.999
My companions helped.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.924
Of course.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.924
Grandfather and I have talked a lot ...

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.924
about your options.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.924
Most of the stones are found,
of course.

01:01:00.225 --> 01:01:01.225
Zoja.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.924
Do you think it is enough to
to save us?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.924
I hope so.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.324
There are only a few people who
can say that they possess true virtue.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.124
Do you believe that your virtue has, Arkady?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.924
Come on.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.924
This mirror can reveal many things.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.924
Tell me what you see.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.924
Breathe in the darkness.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.924
Let it consume you.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.924
Wait!

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.924
Guardian ...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.924
You're a great warrior.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.924
Bigger than the boy.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.924
You are the guardians.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.924
The virtues in the stone ...

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.924
correspond to the virtues in man.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.924
The power ...

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.924
is in you.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.924
My name ...

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.924
Maxim is.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.924
I'm from the country viros.

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:11.025
At the foot of the mountain Drakor.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.224
We are a stubborn people.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.924
However, we are proud.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.724
No!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.924
We come as friends.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.924
We carry the news of the knight Maxim.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.924
This is all he left behind.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.924
You're very gentle.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.924
Thank you

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.924
There is not much time left.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.924
We must go.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.999
Why are we here?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.999
Kirill's army passes still ahead.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.924
We stay here until tomorrow.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.924
The dragon will not see us.

01:11:27.225 --> 01:11:28.925
There is a stone,
and I can find.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.924
Arkadi trust, we must stay here tonight.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.924
If everything fails, as long as you trust me,
then we have hope.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.924
Katya!

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.924
Take me to Kirill.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.924
The Guardian has failed the last
stone found.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.924
Yes, my Lord.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.924
You did good.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.924
Thank you, my Lord.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.924
Now there is nothing left in my way.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.924
Katya!, Katya!

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.924
She has failed you, Guardian.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.924
No!

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:32.525
Take her to the pit.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.999
No, let her!

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.999
Katya!

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.924
I agree.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.999
Katya, it's not you.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.924
Katya Tarkadi.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.924
It's not you.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.924
If you insist boy ...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.224
to prove yourself.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.924
So you can lose your loved ones.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.924
Your world is dying ...

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.924
and I give life.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.999
Behold ...

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.924
my strength.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.924
The virtue in the stone ...

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.424
corresponds to the virtues,
in man.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.924
The power lies in you.

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.324
We did it, Grandpa.
