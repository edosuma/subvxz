11:12.129 --> 11:13.130
ENOUGH FOR A LUNCH
AT THE PIZZAMAT.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.424
BETTER THAN NOTHING.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.052
{\an1}AND WE DID REFER EVERYONE
TO ROCKET BOARDS

11:18.135 --> 11:20.012
{\an1}SO SOMETHING GOOD
CAME OUT OF IT.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.180
{\an1}BESIDES YOU BEING ALIVE,
YOU MEAN.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.308
HUH... CAN'T FORGET THAT.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.685
{\an1}SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CELEBRATE?

11:26.769 --> 11:29.772
GRAB A SLICE AND
HIT THE WATER SLIDES?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.941
OH, YEAH, GOOD PLAN!

11:36.070 --> 11:38.739
OKAY, BUT
IN REVERSE ORDER.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.784
YEAH, LAST TIME YOU ATE
BEFORE THE WATER SLIDE

11:41.867 --> 11:44.120

12:14.900 --> 12:17.027
I CAN'T BELIEVE
CONROY WON'T TELL US.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.487
WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.865
MAYBE CONROY'S INSTALLING
A BIG STATUE OF ME.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.910
{\an5}Reggie:
YEAH, WITH THE BIGGEST
PART BEING YOUR HEAD.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.121

I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.043
LOOK AT THOSE VERTICAL WALLS!

13:14.126 --> 13:15.961
I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT'S OPEN!

13:23.302 --> 13:25.346
THIS IS MY CHANCE

13:25.429 --> 13:27.723
{\an1}TO LEAVE MY MARK
ON MADTOWN FOREVER.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.391
BAD IDEA, TWIST.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.560
IT'S JUST MY INITIALS.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.728
(<i> laughs</i> )

13:32.811 --> 13:34.563
DO YOU NEED HELP
SPELLING THEM?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.106
NO...

13:37.608 --> 13:39.527
SAMMY, UM, YOU THINK YOU CAN...

13:39.610 --> 13:42.071
THIS GOES AGAINST EVERY
ORDINANCE IN THE BOOK!

13:42.154 --> 13:45.407
RELAX, GUYS,
NOBODY'S GOING TO FIND OUT.

UH...

13:53.415 --> 13:54.875
DON'T SAY IT!

13:58.170 --> 14:01.131
CAN I WRITE MY INITIALS
ON YOUR FOREHEAD?

14:09.723 --> 14:11.433
NO...!

14:13.227 --> 14:16.438
GET READY
FOR SOME AWESOME AIR!

14:16.522 --> 14:18.274
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SKATE THE NEW RAMP.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.026
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THAT LAST
PIECE OF CEMENT OUT OF MY NOSE.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.781
HUH? DON'T BE SO PSYCHED
SO SOON, YOU GUYS.

{\an5}Kids:
WE WANT TO SKATE,

WE WANT TO SKATE,
WE WANT TO SKATE...!

14:32.371 --> 14:33.163
WHAT'S UP?

14:33.247 --> 14:37.334
AAH! MADTOWN IS
THE VICTIM OF A VANDAL!

14:37.418 --> 14:38.460
VANDALIZED?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.378
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:39.461 --> 14:42.047
IT'S A TRAVESTY, I TELL YOU.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.216
{\an1}THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE
NO NEW VERT RAMPS

14:44.300 --> 14:45.801
FOR ANY OF YOU RASCALS TODAY.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.220
VANDAL? OH, NO...
I MEAN...

14:48.304 --> 14:51.724
OH, MY GOSH!

14:51.807 --> 14:53.559
THERE'S A FACE
AND PAW PRINT

14:53.642 --> 14:56.228
{\an1}RIGHT IN THE TRANSITION
OF MY NEW VERT RAMP!

14:56.312 --> 14:59.231
NOBODY'S GOING TO SKATE
TILL IT'S FIXED.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.859
SOMEBODY RUINED IT
FOR ALL OF YOU.

15:01.942 --> 15:02.318
LOOK!

15:02.401 --> 15:06.322
All:
WHOA...

15:06.405 --> 15:08.616
OH, THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE!

15:08.699 --> 15:12.161
WHO COULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?!

15:12.244 --> 15:14.163
OH, THE HUMANITY!

15:14.246 --> 15:16.707
All:
OH...

15:16.790 --> 15:19.460
MAYBE ONE OF YOU KIDS
WILL COME FORWARD

15:19.543 --> 15:23.005
AND TELL ME WHO DID THIS
TO MY NEW RAMP!

15:23.088 --> 15:24.048
UH-OH...

15:24.131 --> 15:27.343
UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHO DID SUCH A THING

15:27.426 --> 15:32.097
MADTOWN SKATE PARK IS
OFFICIALLY CLOSED TO EVERYONE!

15:32.181 --> 15:34.516
All:
OH...!

15:34.600 --> 15:37.394
YEAH, WHAT MY MAN CONROY SAID.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.479
AND THAT GOES
FOR YOU, TOO, OTTO.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.564
THAT'S NOT FAIR! HEY...

15:40.648 --> 15:44.193
(<i> kids talking angrily...</i> )

15:47.988 --> 15:49.823
OH, BROTHER.

15:55.871 --> 15:59.458
{\an5}WE COULD HAVE HAD
PERFECT RAMP-AGE
TODAY, TWISTER.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.628
LAME PLUS LAME TIMES LAME

16:02.711 --> 16:05.881
EQUALS LAME-O, TWISTER.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.800
HUH? AAH...!

16:10.386 --> 16:11.762
WAY TO GO, CEMENT HEAD!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.975
ARE YOU GUYS MAD AT ME?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.727
WHOA... OW!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.187
NO...

16:18.811 --> 16:20.187
NO...

16:21.980 --> 16:24.733
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
TRIED TO STOP ME.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.901
WE DID.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.611
I DON'T REMEMBER
THAT PART.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.406
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HIT
YOUR HEAD ON THE CEMENT.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.991
YOU HEARD CONROY,
TWIST.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.745
UNTIL HE FINDS OUT WHO DID IT,
NO ONE SKATES AT MADTOWN.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.789
{\an1}YOU GOT TO TURN
YOURSELF IN.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.167
BUT IF I TURN MYSELF IN,
THEY'LL THINK I DID IT!

16:42.251 --> 16:43.085
Others:
YOU <i> DID</i> DO IT!

16:43.168 --> 16:46.088
YOU GO TO TURN YOURSELF IN
FOR ALL OF US

16:46.171 --> 16:49.299
OR WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO TEAR UP MADTOWN AGAIN.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.344
THINK CONROY WILL BE COOL
ABOUT IT?

16:54.430 --> 16:55.723
(<i> sirens wailing</i> )

16:55.806 --> 16:57.099
{\an5}Reporter:
AND THE MANHUNT
CONTINUES FOR

16:57.182 --> 17:00.436
MAURICE "TWISTER,
THE CEMENT HEAD" RODRIGUEZ.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.604
This notorious vert ramp
cement vandal

17:02.688 --> 17:03.814
has eluded Madtown
Skate Park officials

17:03.897 --> 17:07.608
for six weeks
and is still at large.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.653
Madtown manager Conroy Blanc
is furious.

17:09.737 --> 17:14.407
HE MESSED UP MY CEMENT
BIG TIME!

17:14.491 --> 17:19.454
OOH, WAIT TILL I CATCH
THAT LITTLE RASCAL!

17:19.538 --> 17:24.960
{\an5}CHANGE THE CHANNEL,
CHANGE THE CHANNEL,

17:26.795 --> 17:28.881
THIS STINKS ON ICE, DUDE!

17:28.964 --> 17:30.591
YOU GOT TO CONFESS.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.969
{\an5}I DON'T KNOW...
I MEAN, I COULD,
BUT THEN...

17:34.052 --> 17:38.057
HEY, WHY DON'T WE JUST
HEAD OVER TO SEE IF CONROY'S

17:38.140 --> 17:40.058
{\an1}FORGOTTEN
THE WHOLE THING?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.315
ATTENTION, ALL SUSPECTS!

17:46.398 --> 17:49.651
{\an1}MADTOWN IS STILL CLOSED,
AND WILL REMAIN CLOSED

17:49.735 --> 17:52.905
UNTIL WE FIX THAT!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.869
{\an1}NOW'S THE PERFECT
TIME, TWIST.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.704
{\an1}YOU GOT TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.374
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.169
UH, CONROY?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.213
{\an1}YES, TWISTER,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

18:09.296 --> 18:11.590
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.509
YOU SEE, I WAS HERE
THE OTHER DAY, AND I...

18:13.592 --> 18:15.928
WAIT A SECOND.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.096
EVER I FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS THING

18:17.179 --> 18:21.350
THAT PERSON WILL NEVER BE
ALLOWED TO SKATE MADTOWN AGAIN

18:21.433 --> 18:22.518
EVER, EVER,
EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER!

18:22.601 --> 18:24.770
(<i> feedback wails</i> )

18:24.853 --> 18:27.272
YES, TWISTER?
YOU WERE SAYING?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.858
UH, I THINK WHOEVER
DID THAT TO YOUR RAMP

18:29.942 --> 18:32.069
IS REALLY LIKE, LIKE,
REALLY BAD.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.362
I WASN'T EVEN NEAR
THAT RAMP. BYE.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.364
HMM...

18:35.447 --> 18:37.491
HEY, YOU!

18:40.202 --> 18:40.702
DID YOU CONFESS?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.538
UH, DEFINE "CONFESS."

18:42.621 --> 18:44.915
THAT'S A "NO."

18:45.958 --> 18:47.042
GET BACK HERE, YOU.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.794
IF I DON'T SKATE
MADTOWN TODAY

18:48.877 --> 18:50.003
I'M GOING TO FREAK!

18:50.087 --> 18:51.421
{\an1}YOU'D THINK
THEY'D JUST DO

18:51.505 --> 18:52.339
WHAT THEY DID
IN <i> CINDERELLA.</i>

18:52.422 --> 18:54.466
{\an1}YOU KNOW, FIND OUT
WHO THE CEMENT SHOES FIT.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.593
{\an1}WHAT?!

18:56.677 --> 18:57.719
THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I'LL NAIL

18:57.803 --> 19:00.430

SINGLE FILE!
NO PUSHING!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.487
HEY, KID, WHERE WERE YOU
ON SATURDAY?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
I WAS DELIVERING FOOD
TO THE ELDERLY?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.284
AH, LIKELY STORY.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.328
MAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN
CONROY THIS INTENSE.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.250
NO MATCH-- YOU MAY ENTER.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.252
(<i> all cheering</i> )

19:30.335 --> 19:31.628
OKAY, WHAT DO I DO?

19:31.712 --> 19:34.089
IF I GO UP THERE,
HE'LL KNOW IT'S ME

19:34.173 --> 19:36.758
{\an5}AND I'LL NEVER
BE ALLOWED TO SKATE
MADTOWN AGAIN!

19:36.842 --> 19:38.677
YOU SHOULD HAVE
CONFESSED.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.095
YEAH, TWISTER.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.682
{\an5}YEAH, AND YOU
SHOULD HAVE KEPT
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.142
{\an5}I CAN'T BELIEVE

THIS IDEA!

19:45.225 --> 19:48.478

20:00.991 --> 20:01.825
AH, NO MATCH.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.743

20:02.826 --> 20:04.953
OH, MAN, OH, MAN.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.623
IT'S LIKE RAYMUNDO
ALWAYS SAYS:

20:07.706 --> 20:11.293
{\an1}DON'T DO THE CRIME
IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.339
{\an1}I LIKE WHAT LARS SAY BETTER:
RUN AWAY! SEE YA.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.465

20:32.356 --> 20:35.192
ME?! ME?! WHAT?!

20:35.275 --> 20:37.235
MY HEAD'S NOT SHAPED LIKE THAT!

20:37.319 --> 20:38.111
(<i> both gasp</i> )

20:38.195 --> 20:39.363
YOU HAVE WRECKED

20:39.446 --> 20:41.114
MY NEW RAMP,
LITTLE MAN.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.533
NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU
BE ALLOWED TO SKATE

20:43.617 --> 20:45.911
{\an1}IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL
PROXIMITY OF MADTOWN.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.663
YOU ARE FOREVER BANISHED.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.664
WAIT!

20:48.747 --> 20:49.998
IT WASN'T ME.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.333
THEN WHO WAS IT?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.210
IT'S... IT'S...

20:56.588 --> 20:57.005
I DON'T KNOW.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.007
IT JUST WASN'T ME.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.510
AH, WHY SHOULD CONROY
BELIEVE YOU?

21:01.593 --> 21:02.469
Twister:
'CAUSE I DID IT!

21:08.600 --> 21:10.352
{\an1}I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, CONROY.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.815
{\an1}THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO LET
MY MAN OTTO TAKE THE RAP.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.067
{\an1}YOU WANT
MY SKATEBOARD MAYBE?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.276
MAURICE TWISTER RODRIGUEZ...

21:18.360 --> 21:22.406
YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME
IN THIS SKATE PARK!

21:22.489 --> 21:25.659
BUT I, BUT I... OH, MAN...

21:25.742 --> 21:28.996
{\an1}CONROY, TWISTER CAN'T HELP IT--
HE'S TWISTER.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.038
HE NEEDS A SKATE PARK.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.041
{\an1}THINK WHAT HE WOULD DO
OTHERWISE.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.003
{\an5}COME ON, CONROY,
WHO'S MORE FUN
THAN TWISTER, HUH?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.212
WHO, HUH, WHO?

21:37.295 --> 21:37.879
A CLOWN?

21:37.295 --> 21:37.879
{\an1}TWISTER!

21:37.963 --> 21:41.049
BUT HE MESSED UP MY NEW RAMP.

21:41.133 --> 21:41.842
CONROY, I'M SORRY!

21:41.925 --> 21:44.886
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, MAN.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.888
I SLIPPED INTO THE CEMENT.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.224
I'M SORRY!
I REALLY, REALLY MEAN IT!

21:49.307 --> 21:51.560
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.895
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH
IS A BAD THING, TWISTER.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.273
BUT I TOLD THE TRUTH!

21:56.356 --> 21:57.858
IT JUST TOOK ME A WHILE.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.360
{\an1}COME ON, CONROY,
LET TWIST BACK IN.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.947
AH, I'LL LET HIM BACK IN
AND FORGIVE THE LITTLE MAN.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.323
(<i> kids cheering</i> )

22:05.407 --> 22:07.409
YEAH, CONROY!

22:07.492 --> 22:08.785
ON ONE CONDITION.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.837
All:

PURE OXYGEN, BABY!

22:20.839 --> 22:23.633
INTENSE, LITTLE BRO!

22:23.717 --> 22:26.136
I'M GOING TO... PUKE.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.930
HOW'S IT GOING, TWIST?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.018
WATCH IT!

22:35.854 --> 22:37.939
HEY... OW... OW...

22:38.023 --> 22:39.441
OW... OW...!

22:39.524 --> 22:43.820
I HAVE BEEN HIT TEN TIMES TODAY.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.907
I'VE GOT GUM IN MY HAIR!

22:46.990 --> 22:48.658
IT BEATS HAVING

22:48.742 --> 22:49.701
CEMENT IN YOUR NOSE!

22:49.785 --> 22:50.744
(<i> all laughing</i> )

22:50.827 --> 22:53.205
All:

22:53.288 --> 22:56.541
