&lrm;Go to the principal's office

&lrm;Give me that.

&lrm;I'm here to offer you support

02:16.240 --> 02:18.400
&lrm;but I don't give this power for free.

&lrm;[enviously]

02:34.120 --> 02:35.440
&lrm;[gasping]

02:35.600 --> 02:36.760
&lrm;So unlucky.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.200
&lrm;Can't you add her to another group?
&lrm;We work better on our own.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.920
&lrm;This is a group presentation,
&lrm;not pairs. Deal with it.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.560
&lrm;[bell rings]
&lrm;I hate dealing with it.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.120
&lrm;Could we trade groups?

02:49.280 --> 02:51.880
&lrm;And deal with
&lrm;that twosome of terror? Sorry.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.280
&lrm;But I promise to talk all about you.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.840
&lrm;You're the best!

02:57.360 --> 02:58.720
&lrm;[Chloe] Forget it, Sabrina.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.800
&lrm;I've no time for dumb projects.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.720
&lrm;Besides, now you have Marinette
&lrm;to help you.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.880
&lrm;OK, that's fine.
&lrm;We'll do the work. Don't worry.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.120
&lrm;[Marinette] <i>&lrm;What?</i>

03:08.280 --> 03:09.200
&lrm;Is everything OK?

03:09.360 --> 03:11.280
&lrm;It's fine, Marinette.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.600
&lrm;Why can't you help with the project?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.640
&lrm;None of your business, nosey.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.760
&lrm;Actually, since I'm part of
&lrm;this group, it is.

03:19.240 --> 03:23.560
&lrm;It's OK. You and I will do
&lrm;all the research and the writing

03:23.720 --> 03:26.480
&lrm;then Chloe can present it.
&lrm;That way it's equal.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.480
&lrm;That's not equal at all.
&lrm;Is that how you two work?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.640
&lrm;Yeah, ever since grade school

03:31.800 --> 03:34.000
&lrm;when I started doing Chloe's homework.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.200
&lrm;We've been BFFs ever since.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.840
&lrm;You got a problem with that?
&lrm;Come on, Sabrina.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.240
&lrm;Sabrina, Chloe's
&lrm;taking advantage of you.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.520
&lrm;You don't have to do what she says.
&lrm;That's not how a best friend acts.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.800
&lrm;[Chloe] Not only am I

03:47.960 --> 03:50.840
&lrm;Sabrina's best friend,
&lrm;I'm her only friend.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.560
&lrm;So she better do what I say,
&lrm;cuz without me, she has nothing.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.840
&lrm;I'd rather have no friends
&lrm;than be friends with you.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.640
&lrm;Whatever. I've more important things
&lrm;to do.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.240
&lrm;My hair's a mess and Jean-Claude
&lrm;promised to work his magic.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.600
&lrm;Later.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.920
&lrm;[panting]
&lrm;Marinette!

04:08.960 --> 04:11.200
&lrm;I can't believe you stood up to Chloe.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.880
&lrm;It was so amazing.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.800
&lrm;Well... yeah...
&lrm;What are friends for?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.760
&lrm;I'm super excited to hang out with you

04:18.920 --> 04:21.720
&lrm;and have a new friend
&lrm;who helps with the project

04:21.880 --> 04:23.880
&lrm;We'll have the best time together.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.160
&lrm;We'll do the presentation
&lrm;and tell the truth about Chloe, OK?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.680
&lrm;[uncertainly]
&lrm;Sounds... great.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.880
&lrm;Yay! I'll see you
&lrm;in the library, bestie.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.120
&lrm;[Chloe huffs]

04:37.280 --> 04:39.640
&lrm;What do you mean you're not doing it?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.280
&lrm;Marinette's right. I-I'm not your slave.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.280
&lrm;I never actually said that.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.360
&lrm;But Marinette didn't buy
&lrm;a super cute beret.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.440
&lrm;And I did.
&lrm;Perhaps I could lend it to you.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.160
&lrm;Are you trying to bribe her
&lrm;into staying your friend...

04:54.320 --> 04:55.520
&lrm;with a hat?

04:55.680 --> 04:58.440
&lrm;[excitedly]
&lrm;A really, really adorable hat.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.800
&lrm;That would look fantastic on me.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.320
&lrm;No, excuse me,

05:02.480 --> 05:05.400
&lrm;but you are trying to steal
&lrm;my friend from me

05:05.560 --> 05:06.760
&lrm;with homework!

05:06.920 --> 05:08.720
&lrm;[screaming]
&lrm;My hair!

05:10.720 --> 05:13.480
&lrm;[violent blowing]
&lrm;[screaming]

05:15.880 --> 05:16.920
&lrm;[violent blowing]

05:17.080 --> 05:18.880
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

05:33.440 --> 05:35.280
&lrm;[Chloe] No, not the hair!

05:35.440 --> 05:36.920
&lrm;Time to transform.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.560
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
&lrm;[frightened screaming]
&lrm;No! Stop!

05:58.000 --> 05:59.320
&lrm;Run and hide!

05:59.480 --> 06:00.560
&lrm;[Ladybug squeals]

06:01.520 --> 06:04.960
&lrm;I got wind you were being blown away
&lrm;by a hairy situation.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.520
&lrm;Fewer puns, more action!

06:11.680 --> 06:12.840
&lrm;[Ladybug yells]

06:16.440 --> 06:18.160
&lrm;That guy looks pretty sketchy.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.560
&lrm;[they groan]

06:24.880 --> 06:25.960
&lrm;Where did he go?

06:26.120 --> 06:29.400
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;but he sure illustrates his point.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.400
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Chloe, this Evillustrator,

06:31.560 --> 06:33.040
&lrm;he's targeting you specifically.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.280
&lrm;Any idea why?

06:35.680 --> 06:37.040
&lrm;No, everyone adores me.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.960
&lrm;Yeah, because you're so adorable.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.720
&lrm;Yay! Ladybug said I'm adorable.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.680
&lrm;I totally need a picture of us together.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.880
&lrm;[Ladybug huffs]
&lrm;That was unpleasant.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.600
&lrm;I look great, but your smile's wonky.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.120
&lrm;Let's take another.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.360
&lrm;[Ladybug groans]

06:53.520 --> 06:55.600
&lrm;Sorry, I'm a little camera shy.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.080
&lrm;- Someone's got a fan.
&lrm;- Yeah, great.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.320
&lrm;What's the deal?

06:59.480 --> 07:01.120
&lrm;Why are you acting weird?

07:01.280 --> 07:04.880
&lrm;You gotta admit that
&lrm;having her worship you is awesome.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.760
&lrm;[groaning]
&lrm;Seriously?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.440
&lrm;I'm over this. Let's go.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
&lrm;Are you kidding?

07:09.760 --> 07:11.920
&lrm;What if he attacks her again?

07:12.080 --> 07:13.560
&lrm;Fine, you stay. Later.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.160
&lrm;What do you mean, later?

07:15.320 --> 07:18.240
&lrm;You want to protect her,
&lrm;so you don't need me.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.840
&lrm;So... later!

07:20.000 --> 07:22.880
&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;Ladybug, text me, OK?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.240
&lrm;[cry of pain]
&lrm;Hey!

07:30.640 --> 07:34.280
&lrm;Sorry, Tikki, Chloe just fires up
&lrm;this little red bug.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.440
&lrm;Well, simmer down.
&lrm;A hot head won't get you anywhere.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.000
&lrm;It's hard to keep my cool...
&lrm;especially in school.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.640
&lrm;Oh my gosh, Sabrina, the project!

07:47.200 --> 07:50.040
&lrm;Look like you have a new BFF.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.720
&lrm;[she groans]
&lrm;[footsteps]

07:51.880 --> 07:53.520
&lrm;[worried cry]
&lrm;[Marinette gasps]

07:55.760 --> 07:58.560
&lrm;It's you... from the library.
&lrm;What are you doing here?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.120
&lrm;I wanted to see you.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.440
&lrm;[confused]
&lrm;OK.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.960
&lrm;But why did you attack Chloe?

08:03.120 --> 08:04.440
&lrm;Chloe is cruel and selfish.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.920
&lrm;Can't argue with that.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.920
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;Are you... going to hurt me?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.760
&lrm;You? You're Marinette.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.480
&lrm;You're beautiful, sweet and perfect.
&lrm;I could never hurt you.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.920
&lrm;[embarrassed]
&lrm;Wow, that's very... flattering...

08:19.080 --> 08:20.320
&lrm;Thank you.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.360
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;I just came to ask...

08:22.520 --> 08:27.040
&lrm;It's my birthday today and...
&lrm;would you wanna come to my party?

08:27.200 --> 08:30.960
&lrm;Oh... actually...
&lrm;it's not really the best night.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.320
&lrm;I've got a presentation to work on

08:33.480 --> 08:37.600
&lrm;and I have to call my friend
&lrm;so we can meet and...

08:38.039 --> 08:39.919
&lrm;Please. It'll just be you and I.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.600
&lrm;[romantic music]

08:44.840 --> 08:46.480
&lrm;Oh, my gosh.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.520
&lrm;[awkwardly]
&lrm;That's...me

08:48.960 --> 08:50.040
&lrm;You like it?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.480
&lrm;[hesitantly]
&lrm;I love it.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.000
&lrm;So much that I'll be at your party...

08:56.960 --> 08:57.920
&lrm;on one condition.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.320
&lrm;Anything for you.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.360
&lrm;You can't hurt Chloe anymore.
&lrm;I can't bear violence.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.000
&lrm;For you, and only you.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.480
&lrm;Meet you next to Notre-Dame
&lrm;at sunset.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.440
&lrm;[whooshing]

09:08.600 --> 09:10.240
&lrm;[she sighs]

09:10.400 --> 09:12.360
&lrm;What are you thinking, Marinette?

09:12.800 --> 09:15.120
&lrm;I'm thinking
&lrm;poor Nathaniel has a crush on me,

09:15.280 --> 09:16.840
&lrm;and his alter ego, the Evillustrator,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.160
&lrm;is gonna get crushed by Ladybug.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.560
&lrm;But how is Ladybug going to
&lrm;crush this crush

09:22.720 --> 09:25.880
&lrm;when you're going on the date
&lrm;with him as Marinette?

09:26.040 --> 09:29.040
&lrm;Maybe some cool cat needs
&lrm;to crash the party.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.800
&lrm;[Chloe whines]

09:30.960 --> 09:34.440
&lrm;Sabrina is so selfish
&lrm;making me do this project myself.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.520
&lrm;[whining]
&lrm;My brain hurts.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.200
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;Hey...

09:39.760 --> 09:43.000
&lrm;Cat Noir, are you any good
&lrm;at particle physics?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.560
&lrm;This cat's got
&lrm;particle physics in the bag.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.760
&lrm;Great.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.800
&lrm;Sit, kitty.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.400
&lrm;Now, make it sounds
&lrm;purr-fect for my presentation.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.160
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;See that? I made a cat joke.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.440
&lrm;I can be funny.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.840
&lrm;[sarcastically]
&lrm;Yeah... hilarious.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.320
&lrm;[phone rings]

10:03.520 --> 10:06.760
&lrm;You can't just fly off
&lrm;and then make cat calls, Ladybug.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.640
<i>&lrm;Sorry, that wasn't cool,</i>
<i>&lrm;but you can leave Chloe.</i>

10:09.800 --> 10:11.960
<i>&lrm;I need you to protect this girl.</i>

10:12.120 --> 10:14.560
<i>&lrm;Her name's Marinette.</i>
<i>&lrm;Cute, isn't she?</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:17.600
<i>&lrm;The Evillustrator is in love with her.</i>

10:17.760 --> 10:20.920
<i>&lrm;He won't harm Chloe</i>
<i>&lrm;if Marinette comes to his party.</i>

10:21.520 --> 10:24.240
<i>&lrm;While he's distracted,</i>
<i>&lrm;you take him down.</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:25.480
&lrm;What about you?

10:25.640 --> 10:28.080
<i>&lrm;I'm going on a secret mission.</i>

10:28.240 --> 10:30.840
<i>&lrm;I'll catch you later. Can you handle it?</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:33.200
&lrm;[he chuckles]
&lrm;It'll be a cinch.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.920
&lrm;You're out of danger.
&lrm;So, see ya... Later.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.720
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;Later? What about my presentation?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.120
&lrm;[she growls]

10:42.360 --> 10:44.040
&lrm;[gasping]
&lrm;Sabrina...

10:44.200 --> 10:45.560
&lrm;you scared me.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.320
&lrm;Sorry, I was just waiting for you.
&lrm;Did you get my messages?

10:49.480 --> 10:53.280
&lrm;Yes... Yes I did.
&lrm;And I was totally going to call you.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.680
&lrm;You were?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.160
&lrm;[excitedly]
&lrm;I knew you would... Eventually.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.280
&lrm;So I did your geography homework.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.880
&lrm;[surprised]
&lrm;You didn't have to.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.880
&lrm;Since you're my new best friend,
&lrm;it's the least I can do.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.080
&lrm;Thanks but I can't accept it.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
&lrm;Really?

11:09.280 --> 11:12.080
&lrm;[she sighs]
&lrm;OK, but just this once.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.360
&lrm;Great.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.840
&lrm;So, you wanna work on
&lrm;the project tonight?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.720
&lrm;I'm so sorry Sabrina.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.280
&lrm;I've something really important to do.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.720
&lrm;Something important, really?
&lrm;That's fascinating.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.280
&lrm;You know who else uses that excuse?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.120
&lrm;[hesitating]
&lrm;No...

11:28.280 --> 11:31.360
&lrm;Chloe. I'm beginning to see
&lrm;how similar you two are.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.680
&lrm;You expect me to do all the work,
&lrm;like she did. Right?

11:34.840 --> 11:37.360
&lrm;No...I-I don't, really. It's just...

11:37.520 --> 11:41.440
&lrm;I can't believe I did
&lrm;your geography homework for you.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.840
&lrm;[she sighs]

11:44.080 --> 11:46.440
&lrm;I thought I was going to have to
&lrm;save you from her claws.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.680
&lrm;Get it? Claws.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.360
&lrm;I haven't even introduced myself.
&lrm;I'm Cat Noir.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.720
&lrm;Yeah, I know.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.240
&lrm;You save the day all the time
&lrm;and stuff. I'm Marinette.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.480
&lrm;Why are you here?

11:57.880 --> 12:00.640
&lrm;That birthday-boy date
&lrm;of yours is bad news.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.880
&lrm;[she mimics him]

12:02.040 --> 12:03.400
&lrm;But you're safe with me.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.200
&lrm;That puts my mind at ease.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.840
&lrm;But I am going to need help.
&lrm;Care to assist a superhero?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.160
&lrm;What about Ladybug?
&lrm;Aren't you a duo?

12:11.320 --> 12:12.400
&lrm;She's busy.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.240
&lrm;[she mimics him]
&lrm;So you get to be my Ladybug.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.680
&lrm;[sigh of repulsion]

12:16.960 --> 12:20.480
&lrm;Cat Noir and I
&lrm;fighting crime together? Amazing.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.840
&lrm;What do I do?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.520
&lrm;Just get his pencil away from him.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.400
&lrm;I'll take care of the rest.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.720
&lrm;[she giggles]

12:36.240 --> 12:39.760
&lrm;[bleeping]

12:42.800 --> 12:45.360
<i>&lrm;What a lovely little scene</i>
<i>&lrm;you're setting,</i>

12:45.520 --> 12:47.560
<i>&lrm;but I don't get distracted, boy.</i>

12:47.720 --> 12:49.320
&lrm;I just want Marinette to love me.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.200
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;And I want the Miraculous. So get it!

12:52.360 --> 12:53.240
&lrm;Or else...

12:53.840 --> 12:54.880
&lrm;[throbbing]

12:55.040 --> 12:56.840
&lrm;[fearfully]
&lrm;OK, I will, I will.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.240
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;Happy birthday.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
&lrm;[she giggles]

13:00.760 --> 13:01.840
&lrm;[shyly]
&lrm;Marinette.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.360
&lrm;Thanks for accepting to come.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.120
&lrm;- It's so beautiful.
&lrm;- You like it?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.800
&lrm;Well hold on.
&lrm;I'm just getting started.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.880
&lrm;[he groans]

13:15.040 --> 13:16.600
&lrm;Come on, you've gotta be kidding.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.320
&lrm;Sorry...

13:19.480 --> 13:21.240
&lrm;I didn't mean to startle you.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.760
&lrm;I can't draw in the dark.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.040
<i>&lrm;Voilà!</i>

13:37.240 --> 13:38.480
&lrm;You're so talented.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.040
&lrm;So why would you want
&lrm;to use your power to hurt people.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.280
&lrm;Not all people, just Chloe.
&lrm;And I won't do it again.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.560
&lrm;You were true to your promise
&lrm;so I'll be true to mine.

13:57.640 --> 14:01.520
&lrm;I actually draw a little too.
&lrm;I'm not as good as you, of course.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.000
&lrm;I'm sure you're great.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.080
&lrm;Can I draw you something special
&lrm;for your birthday?

14:09.040 --> 14:11.200
&lrm;[surprised]
&lrm;That would be amazing.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.880
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Marinette, give my pencil back.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.920
&lrm;I need to draw something... now.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.480
&lrm;No... I'm keeping it.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.440
&lrm;Cat Noir, now!

14:22.600 --> 14:24.880
&lrm;Marinette?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.560
&lrm;You're working with him?

14:26.720 --> 14:27.920
&lrm;I'm so stupid.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.400
&lrm;I thought you liked me
&lrm;but you're just like Chloe.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.840
&lrm;Teasing me, mocking me,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.160
&lrm;leading me on!

14:34.320 --> 14:35.800
&lrm;Come on, seriously?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.360
&lrm;Why is everyone
&lrm;comparing me to Chloe?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.800
&lrm;And I'm taking back my promise.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.760
&lrm;Chloe's going to get
&lrm;a lesson she'll never forget.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.080
&lrm;We've been penned in, literally.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.520
&lrm;[Marinette gasps]

15:06.240 --> 15:08.960
&lrm;Cat Noir, put your stick like this,
&lrm;then extend it.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.840
&lrm;- Great thinking.
&lrm;- Yeah, I'm a genius.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.280
&lrm;Gotta go.
&lrm;A superhero's work is never done.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.560
&lrm;Damsels in distress,
&lrm;ladies in waiting...

15:21.720 --> 15:24.600
&lrm;I've more saving to do.
&lrm;You can thank me later.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.400
&lrm;Me thank him?
&lrm;He should be thanking me.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.240
&lrm;We'd still be trapped
&lrm;if it wasn't for me.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.000
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Speaking of which...

15:34.160 --> 15:35.840
&lrm;He needs help saving Chloe.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.080
&lrm;[sobbing]
&lrm;I'm so sorry, Miss,

15:42.240 --> 15:44.080
&lrm;but after what happened
&lrm;in the Library,

15:44.240 --> 15:48.160
&lrm;I couldn't work on my project.
&lrm;It would have been too traumatic.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.760
&lrm;Just look what it's done to my hair.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.480
&lrm;[sobbing suddenly stops]
&lrm;Who's going to believe that?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.360
&lrm;Even a stupid hairdryer
&lrm;couldn't make me look bad.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.480
&lrm;[door rumbles]

16:02.040 --> 16:03.760
&lrm;Cat Noir, is that you?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.120
&lrm;[she gasps]

16:05.280 --> 16:07.680
&lrm;[she screams]

16:08.840 --> 16:13.120
&lrm;Chloe, where are you?
&lrm;Are you hiding?

16:13.520 --> 16:17.440
&lrm;That is so cute.
&lrm;You're playing hide and seek.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.880
&lrm;In the closet?

16:19.440 --> 16:23.360
&lrm;[bleeping]

16:23.520 --> 16:24.400
&lrm;[she screams]

16:24.560 --> 16:26.080
&lrm;[he chuckles]

16:26.240 --> 16:27.360
&lrm;[she screams]

16:27.520 --> 16:30.320
&lrm;I win, Chloe. I found you.

16:30.800 --> 16:35.480
&lrm;My designer dresses, my heels...
&lrm;You're a monster!

16:35.800 --> 16:37.760
&lrm;You like to walk all over people

16:37.920 --> 16:40.560
&lrm;but you don't like it
&lrm;when others trample on you,

16:40.720 --> 16:42.080
&lrm;do you, Chloe?

16:42.240 --> 16:43.400
&lrm;Do you?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.840
&lrm;[she screams]

16:49.920 --> 16:52.480
&lrm;Oops, broke your heel,
&lrm;better watch your ankles.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.000
&lrm;Look what the cat dragged in.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.240
&lrm;No cat dragged me anywhere,
&lrm;Cat Noir.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.840
&lrm;I flew in all on my own.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.480
&lrm;What was the secret mission?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.960
&lrm;If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.560
&lrm;This is what's known as
&lrm;the final showdown.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.560
&lrm;The thing is if you knew her,

17:06.720 --> 17:10.280
&lrm;you wouldn't bother saving her.
&lrm;She's the real baddie!

17:10.440 --> 17:13.599
&lrm;It's not true. Everybody adores me.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.760
&lrm;Look out!

17:30.040 --> 17:31.520
&lrm;[she whimpers]

17:39.600 --> 17:40.840
&lrm;The light...

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
&lrm;- He can't draw in the dark.
&lrm;- Got it.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.520
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:54.640 --> 17:56.000
&lrm;[crumbling]

17:56.560 --> 17:57.480
&lrm;Here, kitty,

17:57.640 --> 17:59.120
&lrm;a ball and chain to play with.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.240
&lrm;Hey!

18:00.400 --> 18:03.200
&lrm;Sadly, those who get in my way
&lrm;get erased.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.960
&lrm;[he yells]

18:06.320 --> 18:07.720
&lrm;[she gasps]

18:07.880 --> 18:09.200
&lrm;[she whimpers]

18:09.360 --> 18:11.320
&lrm;[ring bleeps]
&lrm;No, no, no...!

18:12.960 --> 18:14.440
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
&lrm;Cat Noir's Miraculous,

18:14.600 --> 18:16.120
&lrm;take it, take it now!

18:16.560 --> 18:18.960
&lrm;Before you go,
&lrm;you have something I want.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.080
&lrm;Ladybug,
&lrm;this cat doesn't have 9 lives.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.720
&lrm;Lucky charm!

18:24.160 --> 18:27.120
&lrm;[whooshing]

18:28.920 --> 18:30.240
&lrm;A bouncy ball?

18:30.400 --> 18:33.360
&lrm;Just try and stop me with that,
&lrm;little lady.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.640
&lrm;[she sighs]

18:35.800 --> 18:37.760
&lrm;[tinkling]

18:38.240 --> 18:39.520
&lrm;Gladly.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.680
&lrm;[bouncing and smashing]

18:45.640 --> 18:47.120
&lrm;[he yells]

18:56.320 --> 18:57.400
&lrm;[whimpering]
&lrm;Hurry!

19:00.440 --> 19:02.200
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.480
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:11.560 --> 19:12.600
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.720
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.280
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:18.440 --> 19:22.680
&lrm;[whooshing]

19:23.280 --> 19:24.640
&lrm;[bubbling]

19:24.800 --> 19:27.240
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Where am I?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.200
&lrm;POUND IT!

19:29.640 --> 19:30.680
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;No!

19:30.840 --> 19:34.320
&lrm;Their Miraculouses were
&lrm;practically mine, and they will be!

19:34.480 --> 19:36.480
&lrm;Once I have them all in my grasp,

19:36.640 --> 19:39.360
&lrm;I will have absolute power!

19:42.840 --> 19:44.400
&lrm;[Ayla]
&lrm;What happened when Ladybug

19:44.560 --> 19:46.000
&lrm;and Cat Noir turned up?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.920
<i>&lrm;To be honest,</i>
<i>&lrm;they only made matters worse.</i>

19:49.080 --> 19:51.600
<i>&lrm;They came barrelling in</i>
<i>&lrm;and started smashing things,</i>

19:51.760 --> 19:53.040
&lrm;throwing balls around.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.280
&lrm;Balls?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.440
&lrm;[she giggles]

19:55.600 --> 19:59.200
&lrm;I hope you had a good time
&lrm;taking care of that thing...

19:59.360 --> 20:01.160
&lrm;I'm really sorry, Sabrina,

20:01.320 --> 20:04.720
&lrm;but I can meet you today
&lrm;to work on the project.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.400
&lrm;Too late. Chloe and I are
&lrm;doing the project together.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.360
&lrm;You mean you're doing it.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.880
&lrm;Of course,
&lrm;after all she's been through.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.520
&lrm;[Marinette groans]
&lrm;Nice new beret.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.240
&lrm;I know. Chloe lent it to me.
&lrm;She really is my BFF.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.480
&lrm;Chloe!

20:20.640 --> 20:22.240
&lrm;Your geography homework's ready.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.720
&lrm;[she sighs]

20:23.880 --> 20:26.960
&lrm;Hey, I heard about
&lrm;your adventures with Cat Noir.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.160
&lrm;- Were you scared?
&lrm;- Me, scared?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.760
&lrm;It was a dream...
&lrm;I mean you're a dream...

20:31.920 --> 20:33.280
&lrm;I mean in your dreams.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.040
&lrm;[sighing]
&lrm;This is a nightmare.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.480
&lrm;[uncertainly]
&lrm;OK...

20:37.640 --> 20:40.080
&lrm;So what about Cat Noir,
&lrm;was he awesome?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.680
&lrm;Sure, yeah,
&lrm;but not as awesome as you,

20:42.840 --> 20:45.560
&lrm;because you're
&lrm;the most awesome of awesome.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.120
&lrm;So... that's a yes?

20:49.240 --> 20:51.920
&lrm;[bell rings]

20:53.160 --> 20:55.320
&lrm;Do you realise
&lrm;you just blabbered on to Adrien

20:55.480 --> 20:57.600
&lrm;about how you think he's awesome?

20:57.760 --> 21:00.600
&lrm;He touched me.
&lrm;I'll never wash my jacket again.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.160
&lrm;Girl, you have got to get
&lrm;better control of your emotions.
