ODIE OWNZ!!!
Man: There's a story told in
the town of Big Lake, Texas --

00:43.372 --> 00:46.170
a story of the town's
beginnings.

00:46.241 --> 00:49.802
It's the story
of the Santa Rita Number One,

00:49.878 --> 00:52.780
birthplace
of West Texas Oil.

00:52.849 --> 00:56.012
Now, as with
most Texas legends,

00:56.086 --> 01:00.648
there was a man who thought oil
was right beneath his feet.

01:00.724 --> 01:03.284
And as with
most such stories,

01:03.360 --> 01:06.693
no one else believed him.

01:09.232 --> 01:12.861
Except in this case
for two nuns,

01:12.936 --> 01:15.336
who in 1923 met the man

01:15.405 --> 01:19.740
and believed so much in him
and his dream

01:19.810 --> 01:24.645
that they invested money
no one knew they had.

01:31.689 --> 01:35.090
Now, when the nuns told
their parish priest

01:35.159 --> 01:38.993
about the man's dream
and their investment in it,

01:39.063 --> 01:43.262
now, he counseled them
to try and get their money back.

01:43.335 --> 01:46.793
Sheepishly, they admitted
that it was too late,

01:46.872 --> 01:50.035
that the money
was already spent.

01:50.108 --> 01:54.772
Well, the priest, he sighed,
shook his head,

01:54.846 --> 01:59.408
and offered just
one small bit of advice --

01:59.484 --> 02:02.544
bless the site
with rose petals,

02:02.621 --> 02:05.818
and invoke the help
of Saint Rita,

02:05.891 --> 02:10.693
patron saint
of impossible dreams.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.841
And while the workers
waited for the oil

02:22.909 --> 02:26.436
that would eventually come,
they played baseball.
