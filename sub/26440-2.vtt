07:48.468 --> 07:51.680
The current fuel shortages
on the West Coast.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.891
Temporary, Admiral.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.976
Problems at the Panama Canal.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.145
Problems of their own devising.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.481
An unacknowledged
covert embargo.

08:05.903 --> 08:09.823
The Reich has most
of the world's reserves.

08:11.408 --> 08:15.162
The Nazis mean to strangle us.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.706
Slowly.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.503
As I predicted, Admiral.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.092
And it will fall to you
to manage the situation here.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.552
Trade Minister.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.901
Congratulations,
Chief Inspector.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.653
Your strategy has been
most effective.

17:50.695 --> 17:54.616
The Resistance has been crushed.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.910
Thank you.

17:56.951 --> 18:01.998
And yet the reprisals continue.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.836
Mopping up, Admiral.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.505
A useful reminder
for the natives.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.079
Yes, Admiral.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.407
Yes, Admiral.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.535
An Okinawan.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.706
Good day.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.331
They must be captured.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.583
Don't kill them. No grenades.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.002
Find Hagan and bring him to me.

27:17.178 --> 27:21.223
Find the body
of the criminal priest Hagan.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.948
Take them.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.674
Take me to the other prisoner.
