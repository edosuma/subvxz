18:36.000 --> 18:37.700
OH. WELL...

18:37.700 --> 18:39.300
ACCORDING TO JEWISH LAW,

18:39.300 --> 18:40.500
WHEN A BOY TURNS 13,

18:40.500 --> 18:41.767
HE BECOMES A BAR MITZVAH.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.500
WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS
SON OF THE COMMANDMENT.

18:43.500 --> 18:47.100
SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT
JUST THROWING A PARTY
AND GETTING GIFTS.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.367
NO. I HAD TO DO
A LOT OF STUDYING.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.734
LEARN TO READ AND WRITE
IN HEBREW,

18:51.734 --> 18:52.400
RECITE PRAYERS,

18:52.400 --> 18:54.500
AND ALSO DO A LOT
OF THINKING ABOUT MY LIFE

18:54.500 --> 18:56.400
AND THE KIND OF PERSON
I WANT TO BE.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.200
SO WHAT DID YOU
COME UP WITH?

18:58.200 --> 19:01.600
WELL...I THINK PART OF
BECOMING A MAN

19:01.600 --> 19:03.734
MEANS IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO START TAKING
MORE RESPONSIBILITY

19:03.734 --> 19:05.967
FOR MY ACTIONS.

19:05.967 --> 19:07.567
Dad: NICE.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.500
ANYTHING ELSE?

19:10.100 --> 19:12.567
GIRLS.

19:12.567 --> 19:13.700
I'D LIKE TO START DATING

19:13.700 --> 19:16.400
AND, YOU KNOW,
CALLING 'EM UP ON THE PHONE.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.767
YOU SEE THAT, CORY?

19:21.767 --> 19:25.100
LARRY'S NOT A MAN
BECAUSE HE SAID SO
AND HE THREW A PARTY.

19:25.100 --> 19:30.100
LARRY'S A MAN BECAUSE
HE STARTED TO ACT LIKE ONE.

19:30.100 --> 19:30.834
YEAH.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.400
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
IN ME, DAD?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.900
WELL...

19:34.900 --> 19:35.767
YEAH.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.934
THROWING THIS PARTY
TO GET THIS MONEY

19:37.934 --> 19:39.200
IS SOMETHING I WOULD
EXPECT FROM...

19:39.200 --> 19:40.767
CORY THE BOY.

19:41.767 --> 19:42.600
YEAH.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.967
I GUESS YOU EXPECTED MORE
FROM CORY THE MAN.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.200
PERHAPS CORY THE MAN

19:47.200 --> 19:51.400
SHOULD EXPECT MORE
FROM HIMSELF.

19:55.734 --> 19:57.300
Raven: O TURKEY LEG,

19:57.300 --> 19:58.133
O TURKEY LEG,

19:58.133 --> 20:02.934
WHEREFORE ART THOU,
TURKEY LEG?

20:03.400 --> 20:06.133
YOU ARE IN MY STOMACH,
TURKEY LEG.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.100
YES, YOU ARE.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.700
HA HA HA HA HA!

20:09.700 --> 20:13.100
HEY, TURKEY! STUFF IT!

20:13.100 --> 20:13.900
WHO'S SAYIN' THAT?

20:13.900 --> 20:16.000
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'
ABOUT NO COMEDY.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.133
I KNOW YOU'RE DYIN'
UP THERE.

20:18.133 --> 20:22.367
SO, I GOT SOME FOOD.
YOU AIN'T EATIN'.

20:24.767 --> 20:29.367
OH, I AM SO GLAD YOU CAME!

20:29.867 --> 20:32.500
OK, EVERYBODY,
I'M STOPPING NOW!

20:32.500 --> 20:34.567
[WILD CHEERING]

20:34.567 --> 20:35.600
GET OFF THE STAGE!

20:35.600 --> 20:37.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS WRONG!

20:37.133 --> 20:38.867
THAT IS SO WRONG.
Y'ALL ARE FAMILY.

20:38.867 --> 20:42.834
Y'ALL AIN'T GETTIN'
NONE OF THIS TURKEY LEG, EITHER.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.133
EVERYBODY,
MY FRIEND SYDNEY.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.700
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

20:47.700 --> 20:49.934
HOOK IT UP.

20:49.934 --> 20:51.400
HOW Y'ALL DOIN'?

20:51.400 --> 20:54.200
[CHEERING]
YEAH!

20:54.200 --> 20:55.400
MY NAME IS SYDNEY,

20:55.400 --> 20:58.467
AND, YES, I'M A GIRL.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.000
[SIGHS] I HAVE BEEN
AT SCHOOL ALL DAY.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.233
YOU GOT MATH,

21:03.233 --> 21:05.000
YOU GOT SOCIAL STUDIES,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.400
YOU GOT BOYS.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.600
YOU KNOW THE ONES I MEAN--

21:07.600 --> 21:12.600
THE LITTLE ONES THAT SMELL LIKE
COOKIES AND DIRT.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.233
SO AFTER EVERYTHING
WE DISCUSSED,

21:25.233 --> 21:27.400
IT'S STILL ONLY
ABOUT THE MONEY.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.900
OH, YEAH. I GOT SOME
BIG PLANS FOR THIS DOUGH.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.467
LIKE WHAT?
A FLAT-SCREEN TV

21:31.467 --> 21:33.734
AND A NEW
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM?

21:33.734 --> 21:36.967
OH, WAY BETTER THAN THAT.

21:36.967 --> 21:39.100
OH, LOOK AT
ALL THESE TOYS.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.400
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS, Y'ALL.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.800
YEAH. YOU EVEN GOT
A NEW PLAYHOUSE.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.500
SORRY ABOUT
THE LAST ONE, Y'ALL.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.567
YEAH, BUT WHO BOUGHT
ALL THIS STUFF?

21:47.567 --> 21:49.033
I DON'T KNOW.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.033
UH, THE CARD JUST SAYS,
"FROM THE MAN."

21:52.033 --> 21:56.467
WELL, LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR THE MAN.
