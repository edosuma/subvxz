WEBVTT

00:02.840 --> 00:04.194
I know you're tired,

00:04.280 --> 00:05.794
but just think how good
you're gonna feel tomorrow...

00:05.880 --> 00:07.678
when you wake up and we
have all-new shelf paper.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.798
I wish I didn't get what you were
talking about, but I do. I just do.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.037
Who could
be calling at this hour?

00:13.200 --> 00:15.032
Oh. It's Sal.
Mm-mmm.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.674
No. Not answering that.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.320
Whatever earth-shattering drama
she's going through can wait.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.909
Until she gets here.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.157
Oh, God.
I hope we have vodka.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.041
We don't, Mitchell.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.198
Sal was our best girlfriend
from back in our party days,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.875
but over the years, we've kind
of gone in different directions.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.394
We chose forward.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.676
Why won't this open?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.831
Uh, something's wrong
with that door.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.719
Okay, whatever. I have the most
amazing news, and I'm super excited.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.235
But I won't be if you don't
want me to be. Ready?

00:43.320 --> 00:46.040
- I'm getting married!
- Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!

00:46.160 --> 00:48.197
I know!
Who's the guy?

00:48.280 --> 00:51.273
- The love of my life.
- So you finally bagged your boss.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.000
Oh, yes. But it's not him.
And I don't work there anymore.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.309
His name is Tony.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.915
I met him three months ago.
He's the greatest guy ever.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.719
And seriously,
are you guys okay with this?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.359
Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

01:01.440 --> 01:02.920
Well, you know,
because I can get married,

01:03.040 --> 01:04.554
and you guys... can't.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.597
So? That doesn't mean
you shouldn't.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.718
Really? Because I will not go through with
it if you don't want me to. Seriously.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.957
Not necessary.
What kind of people would we be...

01:12.040 --> 01:14.032
if we denied you or anyone
the right to marry?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.640
Hashtag "politics."

01:15.760 --> 01:18.719
This makes me so happy,
because I want you two to be my best men.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.275
Yes! Yes! Of course!
Of course!

01:21.400 --> 01:23.357
Shh. Okay.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.318
The wedding
is gonna be super cute.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.074
Just us, a little dinner after.
Oh, and it's next Friday.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.032
Oh!
It's next Friday?

01:30.160 --> 01:32.080
Yeah. How will we have
time to do best man stuff?

01:32.120 --> 01:33.840
You know, like help you
pick out your dress,

01:33.880 --> 01:35.951
get your flowers,
get our hair blown out?

01:36.040 --> 01:37.394
He's never been
a best man before.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.960
Oh, my God.
We're getting married!

01:39.040 --> 01:40.474
We're getting married!
Let's have a drink.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.354
We're out of vodka.
I will see you on Friday.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.068
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:53.360 --> 01:54.589
♪ Hey♪ ♪

01:56.960 --> 02:00.510
And initial here
and here and here.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.757
Ay, my arm is starting to hurt.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.633
Just a couple more.
What's going on?

02:04.720 --> 02:06.200
Nothing. I have to
get this package.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.794
But there's so much signing.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.600
Get out of here, you perv.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.400
What's the matter with you?

02:13.480 --> 02:16.678
You don't do that in front of strangers.
At least throw a blanket over it.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.393
I am not ashamed.
Obviously.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.472
They're out all the time.
In front of Manny. At the club.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.200
At Claire's dinner the other day,
Phil almost ate a candle.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.990
Fine. Next time, I will feed your baby
inside a dark closet.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.641
I'm just saying,
pick your moments, huh?

02:28.720 --> 02:32.111
Like, let Daliya open the door.
That's why we hired her. Daliya?

02:32.200 --> 02:36.399
My mother raised six children
while working at a construction job.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.120
She would be so ashamed
if I have a nanny.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.711
I don't see a lot of shame from your mom
when she's cashing my checks every month.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.871
Hey, Daliya, we gotta go see
Manny's teacher.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.397
- Would you try to coax a burp out of this one?
- Come here, little guy.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.000
Can you hold him
a little higher?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.958
I will. I'm just letting him
get settled in.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.509
Okay, we're going.
Bye-bye, Joe.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.512
He likes to bounce a little.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.557
Can you cup your hand...

03:00.680 --> 03:02.751
so that he doesn't feel
like you're slapping? Okay.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.753
She knows it. Stop micromanaging.
Ow.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.354
Cup your hand.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.520
- Hello.
- Hey.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.512
Can one of you guys drive me
to my cello thing tonight?

03:12.640 --> 03:14.233
Honey, I wish we'd known. Yeah.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.397
We got a dinner thing with
the Flendersons. Mmm.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.120
Okay, you don't have to stay,
and those aren't even real people.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.953
Sorry. I panicked.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.157
I get stuck between
the Flemings and the Hendersons.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.358
Oh, my God.
Are those new boots?

03:26.440 --> 03:29.239
- Yes.
- I love 'em. They're so cute!

03:29.320 --> 03:31.198
- They are?
- Oh, I forgot to tell you-

03:31.280 --> 03:33.715
Danielle Gunston-
First one in my class to get pregnant.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.120
You totally called it.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.076
Did you hear that?
My money was on Denise Modick.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.550
No. First she complimented
my fashion sense,

03:41.640 --> 03:43.871
then she told me
I did something right.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.440
Phil, I think it's happening.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.309
Raising a kid is like sending
a rocket ship to the moon.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.120
You spend the early years
in constant contact,

03:52.200 --> 03:54.920
and then one day,
around the teenage years,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.152
they go around the dark side,
and they're gone.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.199
All you can do
is wait for that faint signal...

04:01.280 --> 04:03.158
that says they're coming back.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.712
I think Haley
is sending me that signal.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.273
And?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.916
And Phil gave me that analogy.
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.071
You know what?

04:17.160 --> 04:21.154
I think I'm gonna ask her out to dinner tonight.
Do you think she'll say yes?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.273
If you want, I can pass her
a note in study hall.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.114
- Hey.
- What did I do?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.750
Oh, my God. Nothing. I just wanted
to know, if you weren't busy,

04:30.840 --> 04:33.001
you know, if you wanted
to have dinner with me tonight.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.595
Dinner?
Just you and me?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.353
I mean, you don't have to.
It's cool. Don't worry.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.437
No, sounds fun. Let's do it.
Okay.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.672
Let's meet by the front door then.
You know, 7:00?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.792
Okay.
Yeah.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.318
- I totally think she likes you!
- I think so too.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.633
First of all, I just want to say what a
pleasure it is to have Manny in art class.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.275
He's talented-Can we just
skip to what he did wrong?

04:57.440 --> 04:59.557
Who said that he did something wrong?
Hit it.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.359
- We do have an issue.
- Told you.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.672
Manny seems to have quite a
fascination with the female nude.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.797
So? He's a romantic.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.918
Well, this is all his art work
over the last few weeks.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.400
Holy Moly.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.154
There were even more, but I think
the janitor took some home.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.312
Look at this.
And this.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.914
And these.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.200
Look, I'm an artist.
I'm free.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.556
I used to have
an earring up here.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.316
But some of the other parents
have complained. Well, the moms.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.440
He must have learned that at school,
because we have filters in the computer,

05:32.560 --> 05:34.995
and I have thrown out
all of Jay's magazines.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.639
Don't know what
she's talking about.

05:36.720 --> 05:41.431
There is no way that Manny
has seen this sort of thing at our home.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.073
We'll take it from here.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.278
Hey, buddy.
It's just you and me tonight.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.120
Sounds good. I'll be right down.
All right.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.874
I knew it!
What are you hiding?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.520
Porn.
Don't lie to me!

05:58.600 --> 06:01.399
Fine. I'm trying to send a message
to a girl on Facebook.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.040
But she's so out of my league.
Look at her.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.554
Oh, yeah.
She's cute.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.321
I've been sitting here forever
and I can't think of anything to say.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.673
You are in luck. If anyone knows the art
of wooing the fairer sex, it's this guy.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.876
"Hey."

06:13.960 --> 06:15.360
Wait!
Send.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.035
Why would you type that? Now she
knows I'm thinking about her.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.713
Smiley face.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.440
Oh, my God. Stop now.
We can only screw it up from here.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.121
Please. You're in the
hands of the master.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.356
I think I know how to pick
up a 14-year-old girl...

06:26.440 --> 06:27.430
for you.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.718
"What's the haps tonight?"

06:33.800 --> 06:34.790
Boop.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.236
"What's the haps tonight"?
Nobody says that.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.757
"Going to the mall.
Wanna meet?"

06:43.560 --> 06:48.555
"Dinner at Rosa Grill in an hour,"
question mark.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.960
Boom!

06:50.080 --> 06:52.754
Kids don't eat dinner. You don't eat dinner?
What do you do?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.036
I don't know. You just walk
around and jump off stuff.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.077
You can't invite a girl
to jump off stuff.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.834
Well, it's way better than-

06:59.960 --> 07:02.475
"See ya then. X.O."
You're in, buddy.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.200
I gotta get ready. Oh!

07:09.120 --> 07:11.271
All right. Let's go
before this wears off.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.875
I think we have a few days.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.759
♪ ♪ Well,
thank you, dimples.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.719
You better get
that out of your system,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.838
'cause in two hours, you're
gonna be Mrs. Anthony Lombardo.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.032
Shh. So does
this Italian of yours cook?

07:28.120 --> 07:32.672
In every room of the house,
if you know what I mean! Ooh!

07:34.320 --> 07:35.879
We have a lot of sex.
Yeah. Got it.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.270
Okay, now let's have
a proper toast. All right.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.914
To wild Sal.
Ow!

07:40.040 --> 07:41.394
Yeah!
Yeah!

07:41.520 --> 07:44.592
You gave it a good run,
but like every legendary gunslinger,

07:44.720 --> 07:48.953
there comes a time when you need to holster
your weapons and ride off into the sunset.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.236
But you took on every man
who came to town.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.794
I did. I really did!

07:52.880 --> 07:55.031
You sure did.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.880
Also, you know, I'm just getting married.
I'm not dying.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.792
No, no. We're just
happy you're happy.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.270
And we're excited that we're gonna
get to see much more of you now.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.397
Yes. We'll be couple friends.
Mm-hmm.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.551
We'll go to movies.
Take classes.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.353
Our game nights on
Saturday-Huge.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.796
They're epic. Yeah.
Do you play Cranium?

08:10.920 --> 08:14.550
Well, if I'm playing board games on a Saturday
night, you can shoot me in my cranium.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.831
But I love you!

08:16.960 --> 08:19.111
I need to take a whiz.
Oh.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.913
Oh!

08:21.040 --> 08:23.794
I am so happy for her. I think we
might have freaked her out though.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.834
No, Mitchell. Come on. You're a smart
man, but you are awful at reading people.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.958
Sal's been different this week.
That is a woman in love.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.513
She looks like a woman in love.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.751
Wow.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.072
Look, nobody's as happy as I am
about you loving the ladies.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.001
All I'm saying is
you gotta pull back a little.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.078
- Okay.
- Ay, Manny, this is all my fault.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.470
I am too free with my body.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.115
It was okay when you were a
little boy, but-Was it?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.714
But now that
you're a young man,

08:55.800 --> 08:58.440
and your body-I
didn't hear a word they said.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.954
All I could think
about was Daliya.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.032
Every drawing, every poem,

09:02.120 --> 09:05.158
every historical novel
I wrote was for her.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.038
She was my muse.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.873
Toss in a body
that doesn't quit,

09:08.960 --> 09:10.633
and I think we got a soul mate.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.952
So there's a lot of other things you can draw.
You've got your landscapes.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.555
You've got your bowls
of fruit. Trees.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.235
A barn. The ladies
with the fruit on the head.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.960
- I said fruit.
- But you didn't say the ladies with the fruit on the head.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.158
I'm trying to get him away from the ladies.
Ah, good. Good. Good.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.472
This is so stupid.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.321
What if I spill on her or accidentally
brush my boob against her hand?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.636
I mean her hand
against my boob.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.479
Dude, stay cool.
You got this.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.721
I'm gonna be at the bar the whole time.
If you start to panic, just come get me.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.917
Shh. There she is.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.320
What was that?

09:42.400 --> 09:43.914
I don't know.
I've never heard it before.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.878
Try not to let
that happen again.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.514
Hi, Luke.
Pretty good.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.514
I mean, hi, Simone. Uh, this is my dad.
Dad, this is Luke.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.159
You're funny.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.392
Looking. Clutch.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.039
What are you still doing here?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.600
What the
hell got into me?

10:00.640 --> 10:02.120
Besides the bartender's tongue?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.590
Yes. Yes, well, that was
a little inappropriate.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.991
But let's not overreact. It's perfectly
natural to have a panic attack...

10:08.080 --> 10:10.072
before making
a big life decision.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.594
What if it's
the wrong decision?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.912
What if Tony's not the guy?
What if he's the guy?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.798
Or him? He is cute.
When did he come in?

10:16.880 --> 10:18.678
Okay. You need to focus, Sal.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.320
You are about to make
a sacred, lifelong commitment.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.869
You are not making this better!

10:23.960 --> 10:26.270
Oh, God, it's Tony.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.353
I'm supposed to pick him
up and drive him to the wedding?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.551
Everybody shut up for a second!

10:33.960 --> 10:36.350
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna marry him.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.159
What's the worst that can happen?
I get a divorce.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.714
People do it all the time.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.712
Oh, you're suffocating me!

10:41.800 --> 10:44.315
It is not too late.
You are not married yet.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.392
You're right.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.600
Okay. No, that's good. Get it all out.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.478
Here. Let me help you.
Okay, Mom?

10:53.560 --> 10:55.995
Mom. Mom. Oh, my God.
Mom. I think I got it.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.833
I've been lugging this thing around
for 10 years.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.600
Okay. You sure
you don't want us to stay...

10:59.640 --> 11:01.871
and hear you play?
Mmm, that's okay.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.721
Yeah, I agreed to dinner, not tickets
to the Electric Light Dorkestra.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.992
Don't be so mean to your sister.
No, that's our band's name.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.800
So, you wanna go back
to that vegan place?

11:10.880 --> 11:12.837
Ooh. Leather jacket.
Can't take the hate.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.394
Haley!
Gabby!

11:14.520 --> 11:17.160
What are you doing here? I just
stopped in for a bump of coffee...

11:17.280 --> 11:19.400
before I meet up with Zoe
and those guys at Noodlecat.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.397
Do you wanna go? So
what's-What's Noodlecat?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.041
Oh, it's this
really cool Asian place...

11:23.080 --> 11:25.072
that sells, like,
a million different kinds of noodles.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.594
And hopefully, no cat.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.996
Well, that sounds cool.
So you don't mind if I go?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.515
Oh, I kind of thought
we had plans.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.150
Oh, yeah. You're right.
So I can meet you guys there after.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.954
How long are you gonna be there?
No, it's fine. It's fine. Go.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.720
I'll stay and watch Alex.
Oh, now I feel bad.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.870
Mmm.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.634
Love you! Mwah.
Okay.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.310
Excuse me.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.960
You're Luke's dad, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.952
I'm Valerie, Simone's mom.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.594
Oh. Phil.
Hi.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.831
I recognized you from when you
hosted the school's talent night.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.997
Oh.
You were incredibly limber.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.470
Ah, when you wear the right pants.
Please, sit down.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.273
Thank you.
Yeah.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.757
So, how is the big date going?
I don't know.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.400
Simone was so nervous. When they
were chatting on the computer,

12:11.480 --> 12:12.994
I had to write
everything for her.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.072
That's so funny.
I did the same thing for Luke.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.080
So the whole time,
we were talking to each other?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.476
Wait, does that make this our date?

12:20.880 --> 12:23.190
Well, a good father,
funny, handsome.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.078
A girl could do a lot worse.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.679
You know what, Mitchell?
Forgive me if my Missouri is showing,

12:30.760 --> 12:32.274
but what she is doing
is not marriage.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.716
It's a mockery of marriage. It's mockerage.
And I'm gonna stop it.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.234
No. No, you're not.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.073
I can't help but think
you're infusing the situation...

12:38.160 --> 12:39.833
with just a touch
of your own frustration.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.037
Why, because we've built a life together
for the last 10 years?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.918
Because we're raising a child?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.878
Or because I was the first person
to think of doing...

12:46.000 --> 12:48.390
an elaborately choreographed dance at our
wedding, and now it's been done to death?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.915
If it makes you feel any better,
I was never gonna do that.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.356
But... I get it.
Well, you know what?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.160
She can't get married if the best man
doesn't hand over the wedding ring.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.634
You wouldn't.
Yes, I would.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.120
Where is it? Give it to me. Give me the ring.
Stop it. Stop.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.476
You have to give me-Well,
this is a mystery solved.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.552
Thank you!

13:04.640 --> 13:06.916
Okay. Let's go do this.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.434
Okay.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.159
How hot does Tony look?

13:10.280 --> 13:12.875
On a scale of one to bartender?
Reel it in, Cam.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.191
I think this is broken.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.880
We're gonna have to find another spot.
No, we'll be late for the movie.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.040
You sure you're doing it right? We both
know I know how to use a credit card.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.597
I'll put a note on the meter. Let me get a
piece of paper. Maybe this is a bad sign.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.797
Maybe I'm not supposed
to be in the movie theater.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.633
I'm supposed to be
at home with my baby.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.315
Honey, we know that Daliya
knows how to take care of Joe.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.154
And what about Manny?
He's supposed to run his own bath?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.799
You know, considering
what's been going on with him,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.920
it might be good for you
to give him a little space.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.310
I mean, this was his idea.
What was?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.950
That we go out tonight so that
we could get some alone time.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.759
Oh, that's sweet.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.399
Uh-oh.
What?

13:47.480 --> 13:49.039
We gotta get home.
Look. Manny's notebook.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.679
More drawings and a poem-
"Ode to Daliya."

13:50.760 --> 13:53.150
So those were not my boobs?
They were Daliya's boobs?

13:53.240 --> 13:54.833
Yep. This is not
a nude descending a staircase.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.873
This is a nude vacuuming a staircase.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.159
Okay, Manny. Joe's asleep.
What do you want for dinner?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.675
Actually, already taken care of.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:15.840 --> 14:18.400
You shouldn't play with your food.
What are you doing here?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.917
I knew you were upset I left,
and I felt bad, so I came back.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.635
You're here out of guilt?
I know. I'm growing up.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.317
Oh. Why are you rolling your eyes at me?
I'm doing a nice thing.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.710
Because I want you to be here
because you want to be here.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.280
Okay, you're being
really needy right now.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.198
Oh, my God. Are
you going through the change?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.591
Stop asking me that
every time I express an emotion.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.117
And no, I am not.
It's just so damn hot in here.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.511
I'm disappointed.
That's all. I-

14:45.600 --> 14:48.399
When you were little,
we used to do everything together.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.552
And I thought maybe
you were coming back around...

14:51.640 --> 14:53.677
and we could be friends again.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.717
I just miss being part
of my daughter's life.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.917
Hey, everybody. Thanks for coming.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.712
Oh, whoa

15:10.840 --> 15:14.516
I thought this was supposed to be
some sort of classical thing. Me too.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.400
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

15:17.520 --> 15:20.877
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

15:20.960 --> 15:22.519
She sings?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.637
I don't even know who that is.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.157
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

15:32.200 --> 15:35.034
Oh, my God, Phil.
You are hilarious.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.755
Yep. That's how I got
my wife of 20 years.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.560
Could we get the check, please?

15:39.640 --> 15:41.120
Oh, no, I got this.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.159
Ooh, funny and generous.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.392
If my husband were more like you,
maybe I'd still be married.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.474
Well, if my wife were here, she'd want me to
be clear that I'm fully committed to her.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.398
You know that, right?
What?

15:53.520 --> 15:57.309
I just wanna make sure, because you
unbuttoned a button, and I love my wife, so-

15:57.400 --> 15:59.960
You were the one who was flirting
and saying we're on a date.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.794
That was a joke,
but I'm sorry if I misled you at all.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.640
Thank you.
But there was a lot of touching.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.074
I touched your shoulder
for a second.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.680
No, it was more of a stroke,
like this.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.556
Okay. I'm so sorry for touching
your hand with my boob.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.956
I mean, my boob with your hand.
Is this your little game?

16:16.120 --> 16:20.034
You cop a feel on a sad divorcée and then
pretend I'm the one coming on to you?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.753
How does that feel?
Oh. Weird.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.951
You like it? Yeah?
No. Uh-uh.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.040
A little bit of that? Yeah.
No. Little bit of-No.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.277
You probably like this, don't you?
Yeah. No. No.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.591
Oh, stop it.
Your daughter's right over there.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.273
My minivan is right outside.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.556
That is not what I meant.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.153
This pizza is delicious.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.392
I like it too.
We have so much in common.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.273
Have you seen
the back of your menu?

16:45.920 --> 16:50.073
"With silken hair
and supple olive skin...

16:50.160 --> 16:53.278
and hands that wash
the laundry of my kin."

16:53.360 --> 16:56.273
- Oh, Manny.
- You still have 12 lines to go.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.159
Spoiler alert: I love you.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.675
Okay, back away from the nanny.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.435
Oh, my God. It looks like
a Madonna video in here!

17:05.520 --> 17:07.477
- Why aren't you at the movies?
- We need to talk right now.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.079
What have you done to my son?
She didn't do anything.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.719
Why do you have to embarrass me?
Embarrass you?

17:11.880 --> 17:14.839
Maybe if you didn't fall in love with
everybody you looked at-

17:14.960 --> 17:17.349
Stop this! You're going to wake the baby.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.229
Now, Manny and I are having a private discussion.
So please, give us a minute.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.239
I'll give you your minute right this minu-Mmm.
Gloria. Gloria.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.193
Go ahead, Manny.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.079
I'm not saying we need
to do anything right away.

17:31.160 --> 17:35.598
- I'm just asking you to wait a few years.
- You are so sweet.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.673
Whoever ends up with you
is the luckiest woman in the world.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.319
That could be you.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.553
No. I am unlucky,
because I was born too soon.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.360
And I can't have you wait around.
Poets have to live.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.114
Besides, in a few years,
you'll feel differently.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.193
You're wrong.
I'll feel this way for the rest of my life.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.760
Manny, wait.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.957
Ay, Manny, papito lindo-
Leave me alone!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.514
Sorry about that.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.677
Don't be. It's the sweetest offer
I've ever gotten.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.639
I am so sorry
that I screamed at you.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.632
It was so nice
what you told him in there.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.796
- I take Manny, you take the little one?
- Okay.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.435
He probably just wants you-
She knows what to do, Jay.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.874
Come on.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.555
Tiramisu.
I love his tiramisu.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.439
Marriage is a promise.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.911
It says to the world that you share a
love and a commitment to each other...

18:29.000 --> 18:32.152
that will only grow deeper
as the years go by.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.715
Now, have you two written vows?
Yeah, I'll go.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.400
Marriage terrifies me.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.960
Take Mitch and Cam.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.032
I used to think their life
looked so boring.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.352
I could never do it.
Pay bills? Wash dishes?

18:44.440 --> 18:46.671
Wake up to the same face
every day?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.877
- I felt sorry for them.
- Where is this headed?

18:48.960 --> 18:51.031
But they're not bored.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.351
It turns out when you're with
the right person,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.751
you can change shelf paper
at 10:00 at night in your pajamas...

18:56.840 --> 18:58.638
and not wanna be anywhere else.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.236
- That's how much they love each other.
- We sure do.

19:02.320 --> 19:06.314
And when I just saw your face,
I remembered-

19:06.400 --> 19:07.834
that's how much I love you.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.673
Thanks for being here.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.195
We wouldn't be anywhere else, Sal.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.760
And do you have
anything prepared?

19:13.880 --> 19:16.714
Hit me, baby.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.320
I made out
with a stripper last night.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.232
Sorry. I just
wanna start this clean.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.354
I made out with a bartender...
an hour ago.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.757
You're not just saying that to make me feel better?
Back me up. Didn't I?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.240
- She totally did.
- I totally did!

19:29.320 --> 19:30.834
- He was hot too.
- He was very good-looking.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.115
Nice.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.669
Well. That was different.
Who's got the ring?

19:34.760 --> 19:37.070
I do. Hand 'em over.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.841
- That's cool.
- Thank you guys so much.

19:41.960 --> 19:46.193
Alex, honey! Amazing! Why didn't you tell us?
Oh, I don't know.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.317
That was so good.
If I didn't know you,

19:48.440 --> 19:50.750
I'd be all, like, "That
chick is cool." Mm-hmm.

19:50.840 --> 19:55.995
Hey, guys, hi. I'm Alex's mom.
You were terrific.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.719
Hey, and I'm her sister.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.355
We're gonna go get some dinner.
Do you wanna come with us?

20:00.440 --> 20:02.591
You can bring your friends
from the band.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.878
No, thanks. We're actually going out, and I
have a ride home, so see you guys later.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.440
Okay.
Oh.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.313
Oh, my God.
Sorry about that.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.433
Did she just apologize for us?
Yep.

20:12.560 --> 20:16.076
But we were just being nice.
Sucks, doesn't it?

20:18.560 --> 20:21.553
Luke, I'm sorry Simone's mom
dragged her away so fast.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.871
It's okay. I was running out
of things to say.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.555
- I guess I kind of blew it for you, didn't I?
- No.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.075
Now that her mom doesn't want her
going out with me anymore,

20:29.160 --> 20:31.072
Simone wants me more than ever.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.072
I guess she's heading
into a rebellious stage.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.719
Best time to get 'em.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.160
Never be afraid to go after a girl
who's out of your league.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.839
I did. That's how
I got your mom.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.395
Yeah. I always wondered how you
pulled that one off.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.279
She was in
a rebellious stage too.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.159
Yep, Grandpa wasn't always
as crazy about me as he is now.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.469
I'm gonna go pop the champagne
and get some glasses.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.074
Yay!
I'll help.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.351
I'm gonna get Cranium.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.234
Hey.
Hey.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.841
Sorry you couldn't come to the wedding.
It was "No kids."

21:07.920 --> 21:10.640
It's okay.
I'll go to your next one.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.554
Wow.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.314
She just means
when she's not a kid anymore.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.959
She knows what I mean.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.872
I don't like you.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.917
I'll get over it.
