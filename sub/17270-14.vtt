You overrode my leadership

If you're gonna threaten to kick me
out every time I step out of line,

00:34.159 --> 00:35.526
you should just do it already.

- Yet.

They paid cash, like you said.

No.

Your father kept me away from Ultra.

But Mom, all this time, you
made me think I was all alone.

02:02.014 --> 02:05.647
I know. Honey, I'm sorry. It's
the only way I knew how to help.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.984
- Why didn't you just talk to me?

- No.

leave him alone with you,

it is to make an alliance with him.

He's too strong.

04:28.908 --> 04:30.309
(SIGHS) Yeah.

04:31.444 --> 04:33.845
- The least I can do is try.
- And what about Marla?

04:34.169 --> 04:35.145
And the boys.

04:35.163 --> 04:37.766

- Good to see you, Jed.

04:51.464 --> 04:53.098
Thanks for the drink.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.905
I tried to warn him, Stephen.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.367
But he was stubborn.

05:04.043 --> 05:05.543
My mom wants us to run.

05:06.245 --> 05:07.846
That would anger The Founder.

Here, I can help you.

09:58.357 --> 10:00.390
Did a breakout actually bump someone off?

10:00.510 --> 10:02.158
Clearly Jedikiah thinks so.

10:02.204 --> 10:04.100
It doesn't make sense. How?

We can't rule out the possibility
of an evolutionary mutation.

The Annex Project,

Hey, what about after you?

11:23.928 --> 11:25.829
I'm tracking a breakout who can kill.

11:25.876 --> 11:28.097
Maybe Ultra rebooted the project.

11:28.128 --> 11:29.618
What does your boss say?

Jedikiah denies knowing anything about it.

11:32.253 --> 11:33.149
Hmm.

11:33.269 --> 11:35.636
- Which he would in any event.
- Exactly.

11:35.675 --> 11:37.225
So how will I know what I'm up against.

11:38.061 --> 11:39.394
You won't.

- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

12:05.905 --> 12:08.550
No signatures matching our
killer. The guy's under a rock.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.151
Sure about that?

12:10.491 --> 12:12.954
No teleports within the last 12 hours.

12:13.545 --> 12:15.657
Try changing your search parameters.

12:15.659 --> 12:17.792
Why would he use that
much energy to teleport?

12:17.794 --> 12:19.876
Because that's how much he used last time.

12:20.796 --> 12:22.931
(GASPS) Oh. What...

12:23.365 --> 12:24.766
Did I break it?

12:24.768 --> 12:26.601
It was five minutes ago.

12:26.782 --> 12:28.303
Hillary, what happened?

12:28.804 --> 12:30.138
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)

12:30.798 --> 12:32.206
HILLARY: This place is owned by the guy

12:32.208 --> 12:34.840
our dead witness was testifying
against in some mob trial.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.045
Maybe our hit man is
here to collect his money.

12:37.217 --> 12:40.007
With his lethal gene unlocked,
he's gonna have a leg up on us.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.450
Well, there's one of him and two of us.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.159
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, he's here.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.490
We should split up.

12:49.492 --> 12:52.214
<i>(THINKING) Stay on channel. Give
me a heads up if you spot him.</i>

13:01.682 --> 13:04.772
Whoa, dude, you should see your face.

13:04.774 --> 13:06.150
What are you doing here?

13:06.181 --> 13:07.675
Same as you. Tracking a breakout.

13:07.677 --> 13:10.144
Why didn't you tell me
your partner was hella fit?

13:10.146 --> 13:12.468
- Damn, girl.
- I have a deal with my uncle.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.608
I stay in line, he keeps my family safe.

13:14.639 --> 13:17.166
- I'm bringing that guy in.
- You have a family to protect,

13:17.210 --> 13:18.385
I have a species.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.755
<i>HILLARY: (THINKING) It's
all clear. I'm coming back.</i>

13:20.757 --> 13:23.157
<i>(THINKING) No, no, no,
wait. I'm coming to you.</i>

13:28.527 --> 13:31.465
HITMAN: Call me if you ever have
another problem, I can solve it.

13:31.467 --> 13:32.800
That's him.

13:46.348 --> 13:47.514
<i>(THINKING) I got this.</i>

13:47.516 --> 13:48.916
<i>CARA: (THINKING) I'll head him off.</i>

14:16.210 --> 14:17.411
Had enough?

14:22.197 --> 14:23.283
Where is he?

14:26.388 --> 14:28.388
- I'll take that.
- No, not this time.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.257
Later, Stevie.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.146
(EXCLAIMS)

14:40.266 --> 14:42.649
Shoulda been a hit man. (CHUCKLES)

14:44.351 --> 14:46.134
Caviar palooza!

14:46.916 --> 14:48.554
This briefcase is bait.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.639
Hey.

14:53.839 --> 14:54.834
What up, Mom?

14:54.871 --> 14:56.529
Are we purging the basement again?

14:57.618 --> 15:00.496
<i>Oh, don't toss my Star Wars figures.</i>

15:00.514 --> 15:02.147
They're worth serious coin.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.105
Wouldn't dream of it, baby.

15:06.807 --> 15:08.160
I'll throw together dinner.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.642
Oh, already thrown.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.444
John hooked us up.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.072
John.

15:13.328 --> 15:14.947
- Mmm.
- I thought....

15:15.287 --> 15:17.750
Stephen was going to
talk to him about leaving.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.222
(CHUCKLING) What's this?

15:23.523 --> 15:24.890
Dig in.

15:25.279 --> 15:27.268
Luca already ate about half a cow.

15:27.915 --> 15:29.679
I'm guessing you guys don't get a lot of

15:29.685 --> 15:31.311
proper family dinners.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.065
I try.

15:33.458 --> 15:37.023
But lately I've been lucky to get
a glimpse of my family these days.

15:37.511 --> 15:40.633
It seems like Stephen just
comes home to change his clothes.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.875
Well this looks great.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.910
You know, I...

15:45.876 --> 15:47.872
I can't even begin to imagine

15:47.928 --> 15:49.486
how hard it's been for you.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.817
And Luca. I can tell you this,

15:52.183 --> 15:55.654
when Stephen's gone, he is out
there protecting paranormals.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.025
What do you mean?

15:57.276 --> 15:59.046
I thought he was just an intern.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.294
Don't Ultra study the Tomorrow People?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.497
Ultra hunts the Tomorrow People.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.401
What?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.972
Stephen has been acting as a double agent

16:15.375 --> 16:18.065
to help us stay one step
ahead of Jedikiah and his

16:18.185 --> 16:19.592
lunatic partner.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.571
That we're even surviving is

16:23.691 --> 16:25.272
pretty much thanks to him.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.387
He's a hero.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.922
(SIGHS)

16:31.424 --> 16:33.091
Just like his father.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.763
Ahem.

16:39.429 --> 16:41.319
Your husband was, umm...

16:42.733 --> 16:44.469
very important to me.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.238
You knew Roger?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.379
So I know how much Stephen takes after him.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.482
Carrying the world on his shoulders.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.151
Doing the right thing.

17:00.515 --> 17:01.848
No matter what the cost.

17:01.898 --> 17:04.476
I pay the cost, every day. Right here.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.023
So does Stephen.

17:06.284 --> 17:08.026
Family is everything to him.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.933
Which is why you got to
understand that if you leave,

17:10.971 --> 17:12.497
if you force Stephen,

17:13.432 --> 17:15.767
he would be leaving his other family.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.748
And we need him just as much as you do.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.285
Hi.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.621
(EXHALES)

17:38.457 --> 17:39.757
My God.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.926
They've gotten so big.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.663
It's been four years.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.059
I keep trying to

17:50.109 --> 17:52.236
lose track of the time,
I figured it would...

17:52.604 --> 17:53.738
you know...

17:54.406 --> 17:55.973
make missing you hurt less.

17:56.093 --> 17:58.142
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.944
No.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.182
You were right.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.720
I brought nothing but
danger to your doorstep.

18:14.459 --> 18:17.061
I know we've said our
share of goodbyes, but...

18:18.430 --> 18:19.864
this is it.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.133
I love you.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.252
(GROANS)

18:43.288 --> 18:44.555
(LAUGHS)

18:44.557 --> 18:46.090
A woman?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.358
(GRUNTS) (GROANING)

18:48.360 --> 18:50.094
I ask the questions.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.428
Who are you?

18:53.892 --> 18:56.676
See? That was a question.

18:56.796 --> 18:58.268
Are you getting the hang of this, yet?

18:58.270 --> 18:59.811
The hit man you hired.

18:59.842 --> 19:01.100
The one you gave the money to,

19:01.112 --> 19:02.432
how do I get ahold of him?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.540
What hit man?

19:05.243 --> 19:09.079
Was that a question coming out of that
pretty little Russian mouth of yours?

19:11.716 --> 19:12.950
Uh...

19:13.584 --> 19:15.840
I have a number for you.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.389
Good boy.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.462
<i>(THINKING) If you can hear
this, we have the briefcase.</i>

19:25.464 --> 19:27.064
<i>We mean no harm.</i>

19:27.832 --> 19:30.500
Talk about a fishing expedition.

19:30.776 --> 19:33.703
This fish lost a million
bucks, he's out looking for it.

19:34.205 --> 19:35.872
Only a matter of time.

19:36.638 --> 19:38.975
<i>(THINKING) If you can hear
this, we have your briefcase.</i>

19:46.450 --> 19:47.751
Get up.

19:48.252 --> 19:49.586
What are you doing?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.288
Have you ever heard of pajamas?

19:51.689 --> 19:53.356
Oh, excuse me.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.025
Wasn't expecting company.

19:55.609 --> 19:58.907
An Ultra agent is always prepared
to dispatch at a moment's notice.

19:58.925 --> 19:59.933
Read your handbook.

20:00.231 --> 20:01.364
We gotta go.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.099
- Where?
- I found him.

20:03.281 --> 20:04.834
Our breakout assassin.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.347
How?

20:07.467 --> 20:10.482
The owner of the club is being
indicted on racketeering charges.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.076
He was the one who ordered
the hit on his main witness.

20:13.611 --> 20:14.981
The motel murder victim.

20:15.579 --> 20:16.679
I've got the hit man's number.

20:16.681 --> 20:17.881
So what are we gonna do with it?

20:18.001 --> 20:19.349
Not we. You.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.084
You're going to hire him to kill a guy.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.079
It's under "H", for hit man.

20:25.961 --> 20:27.890
Let me grab my "P" for pants.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.774
You the guy?

20:45.375 --> 20:46.843
I'm the guy.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.444
Have a seat.

20:50.847 --> 20:52.348
You seem

20:52.749 --> 20:54.050
young.

20:54.819 --> 20:56.984
Well you're not exactly
what I was expecting either.

20:57.688 --> 20:59.735
You know, you come highly
recommended from a friend,

20:59.760 --> 21:01.457
but maybe he was wrong.

21:03.727 --> 21:05.494
Look, I gotta ask.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.863
Are you affiliated with
a law enforcement agency?

21:07.983 --> 21:11.333
Reminding you it would be entrapment
to lie about said affiliation.

21:11.535 --> 21:12.835
No.

21:12.837 --> 21:15.104
I'm just looking for a
permanent fix to a real problem,

21:15.106 --> 21:16.605
you know what I mean?

21:17.974 --> 21:19.608
You mean...

21:20.010 --> 21:21.310
Murder?

21:22.846 --> 21:23.928
The murder you had in mind

21:23.947 --> 21:25.347
is gonna cost you a million dollars.

21:25.882 --> 21:27.519
Seems a little steep.

21:27.951 --> 21:30.165
Plenty of guys could do it for less.

21:30.353 --> 21:31.720
But I'm the best.

21:32.011 --> 21:34.723
I can get in anywhere, anytime, anyhow.

21:36.126 --> 21:37.593
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hands on the table.

21:37.595 --> 21:39.061
Bad idea.

22:14.388 --> 22:15.139
<i>(THINKING) Oh yeah?</i>

22:15.259 --> 22:17.535
Then why did he just
walk onto my subway car?

but you got the wrong guy, Stephen.</i>

23:00.564 --> 23:02.665
Didn't your mother teach you not to steal?

23:02.717 --> 23:04.534
Didn't yours teach you not to kill?

23:04.551 --> 23:06.302
I never killed a soul.

23:07.571 --> 23:09.172
(CLICKING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

23:09.174 --> 23:10.406
Oops.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.077
How is he able to kill?

23:16.380 --> 23:18.047
He's human.

23:18.070 --> 23:19.575
That's impossible.

23:19.609 --> 23:21.737
Only a paranormal could
have pulled off those hits.

23:21.857 --> 23:23.132
We've felt him teleport.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.621
The large tele-signatures.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.372
He has a partner teleporting him.

23:26.379 --> 23:27.743
Where are you pulling this out of?

23:27.745 --> 23:29.145
Wait! Who?

23:29.147 --> 23:30.880
Someone with powers.

23:31.181 --> 23:32.215
A twin.

23:34.451 --> 23:36.218
A paranormal twin.

23:40.587 --> 23:43.059
We need to capture him as soon as possible.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.917
My brother's not going to like this.

23:51.037 --> 23:53.235
He'll come after you.

23:53.570 --> 23:55.805
And when he does, it won't be pretty.

23:55.807 --> 23:57.206
So how does this work?

23:57.208 --> 23:58.888
You teleport him in.

23:58.944 --> 24:00.564
He does the dirty work.

24:02.345 --> 24:04.013

You're as powerless as a mewling kitten.

had a wire around your neck.

Really?

25:20.253 --> 25:21.920
Textbook overcompensation.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.956
The fact of the matter is,

25:24.958 --> 25:28.126
your brother was born with gifts
that would make the gods jealous.

25:28.928 --> 25:32.868
But by some horrible twist of fate,

25:32.887 --> 25:34.466
you were born with nothing.

25:34.870 --> 25:35.940
You're wrong.

25:36.009 --> 25:37.848
Who do you think sets up the hits?

25:37.848 --> 25:39.571
Manages the money?

25:39.573 --> 25:41.020
Huh? My brother needs me.

25:41.064 --> 25:42.907
Because you're shrewder than he is.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.510
Nature's

25:46.038 --> 25:48.272
pathetic attempt at balancing the scales,

25:48.297 --> 25:49.714
but let me tell you something, kid.

25:49.834 --> 25:52.250
One day your brother's going
to realize he doesn't need you.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.160
You're weak.

25:54.366 --> 25:55.543
You're a burden to him.

25:55.568 --> 25:57.444
An albatross around his neck.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.224
He doesn't need you.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.393
But what if I could help you?

26:03.883 --> 26:06.864
What if I could help you get the
powers that are your birthright?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.234
Make you your brother's equal.

26:11.537 --> 26:12.737
How?

26:13.056 --> 26:16.253
Mmm. Well I would need a donor, first.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.944
Your twin.

26:34.364 --> 26:35.798
The answer's no, Stephen.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.834
Cyrus may not be able to kill,
but he's an accessory to murder.

26:38.836 --> 26:40.235
Let me take him in.

26:40.237 --> 26:42.873
It is my duty to protect the
Tomorrow People. All of them.

26:42.923 --> 26:45.513
What about the other criminal
breakouts we've given to Ultra?

26:45.909 --> 26:48.154
Cyrus was being manipulated by his brother.

26:48.154 --> 26:50.762
If you want to punish someone, it
should be the brother that you've got.

26:51.114 --> 26:52.381
But no. You and Jedikiah
are too busy scheming

26:52.383 --> 26:54.249
to make Nathan sell out his own twin.

26:55.051 --> 26:56.837
<i>(THINKING) Are you reading my mind?</i>

26:57.638 --> 26:59.779
Since you've become your
uncle's lackey, yeah.

27:00.004 --> 27:00.789
I am.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.158
You're supposed to be our inside man.

27:03.183 --> 27:05.385
And you're supposed to
help me protect my cover.

27:05.775 --> 27:07.309
I don't want to argue with you, Stephen.

27:08.177 --> 27:10.545
I'm sorry, I just don't have it in me.

27:12.581 --> 27:14.831
This place is falling apart without John.

27:16.118 --> 27:17.285
(DOOR OPENING)

27:18.821 --> 27:19.988
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:20.437 --> 27:23.506
Oh, this is ridiculous. Cara is so...

27:23.540 --> 27:25.692
Stubborn? Fearless?

27:26.311 --> 27:28.529
- Beautiful?
- In over her head.

27:28.531 --> 27:30.732
First kicking out, then
refusing to let go of Cyrus,

27:30.734 --> 27:33.687
she's just making one
mistake after another.

27:33.705 --> 27:35.036
She does have a point.

27:35.663 --> 27:37.359
Really? You're going to defend her?

27:37.390 --> 27:39.786
Jedikiah is going to use
these twins as guinea pigs.

27:39.849 --> 27:41.188
I thought that was just a ploy.

27:41.308 --> 27:43.344
No. It's real. Trust me.

27:45.447 --> 27:48.249
Power transplants are the
Holy Grail for Jedikiah.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.118
Well, has he ever succeeded?

27:51.353 --> 27:52.420
No.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.655
I saw one once myself.

27:58.026 --> 28:00.151
The human is forced to watch

28:00.689 --> 28:04.450
as the paranormal is strapped
into this medieval looking chair

28:05.007 --> 28:07.201
that harvests their stem cells.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.970
Every time,

28:10.439 --> 28:12.039
the paranormal dies.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.274
In pain.

28:15.544 --> 28:17.260
Imagine if that was you and Luca.

28:17.276 --> 28:18.990
Okay. I get it.

28:20.035 --> 28:22.816
So, like I said, maybe Cara's
right to want to hold on to him.

28:26.254 --> 28:29.101
Look, uh, obviously murder is...

28:29.445 --> 28:30.677
wrong, but...

28:31.114 --> 28:33.705
How do you and your
brother spend all the money?

28:34.462 --> 28:37.714
Are we talkin', uh, models
and bottles in Dubai?

28:37.834 --> 28:39.422
Savile row tailors?

28:39.635 --> 28:41.335
Holidays on the Riviera?

28:41.837 --> 28:43.303
Paint me a picture.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.906
Uh, we bought a house.

28:46.026 --> 28:47.508
Uh, in Connecticut.

28:48.743 --> 28:50.344
Buzzkill.

28:50.371 --> 28:53.086
Uh, it's big, it's got two washer-dryers...

28:53.581 --> 28:56.183
<i>(PULSATING) NATHAN: Cy?
Where are you? I need you.</i>

28:56.918 --> 28:59.537
<i>Cy, they're hurting me.</i>

28:59.587 --> 29:00.457
Dude, are you okay?

29:00.577 --> 29:01.758
Nathan's in trouble.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.584
I can feel it. They're hurting him.

29:03.634 --> 29:04.625
<i>(THINKING) Cara?</i>

29:06.888 --> 29:10.329
Please. Take off the cuffs.
I have to help my brother.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.798
Cyrus, listen to me. It is a trap.

29:12.037 --> 29:15.216
Your brother's been captured, and he's trying
to manipulate you into turning yourself in.

29:15.228 --> 29:17.480
(STAMMERING) No, I can
feel him. He needs me.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.357
Your brother has been using you for years.

29:19.370 --> 29:21.440
- This is finally your chance to be free of him.
- No...

29:21.472 --> 29:24.306
(STAMMERING) No, I have to
get to my brother. Please.

29:24.426 --> 29:27.190
- No, I will not let you...
- He's my family.

29:27.522 --> 29:31.195
You must have someone in your life
you'd sacrifice everything for.

29:33.054 --> 29:35.418
I thought your offer to give
Nathan powers was a trick.

29:35.538 --> 29:38.021
But it's real, only the
procedure will kill his brother.

29:38.033 --> 29:38.853
Hmm.

29:39.466 --> 29:41.806
I wonder where you got that
little piece of information?

29:42.519 --> 29:45.565
Not many of our agents know
about our transference protocol.

29:47.850 --> 29:51.178
Well, you're right. In the
past the donor has typically...

29:51.491 --> 29:52.667
expired.

29:52.787 --> 29:54.294
But that's science, Stephen.

29:54.301 --> 29:56.741
It's success built upon decades of failure.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.919
And besides, we've never tried
the experiment on twins before.

29:59.951 --> 30:01.247
And you never will.

30:01.249 --> 30:04.551
Cyrus isn't gonna fall for your little
trap. The guy's sitting on a million bucks.

30:04.725 --> 30:06.519
He's probably out of the country by now.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.274
<i>CARA: (THINKING) I hope you're happy,
Stephen. Cyrus is turning himself in.</i>

30:12.401 --> 30:15.092
You okay? You're looking
a little dyspeptic.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.849
I'm unarmed. I don't want any trouble.

30:19.366 --> 30:20.466
Well, well, well.

30:20.468 --> 30:22.735
It looks like my little trap paid off.

30:24.271 --> 30:27.173
Take him to the lab. Prep
them both for the procedure.

30:36.683 --> 30:39.278
- Nathan, don't do this.
- What are you doing?

30:39.278 --> 30:42.136
If you try and take away
his powers, Cyrus will die.

30:42.256 --> 30:43.923
I've seen my share of death.

30:45.341 --> 30:46.580
He's your brother.

30:46.980 --> 30:51.003
What are you doing? Even if this
procedure works, which it never has,

30:51.123 --> 30:52.217
he dies.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.101
Are powers really worth that much to you?

30:55.635 --> 30:58.437
So easy for you to say.

30:59.055 --> 31:01.607
You don't know what it's
like to be born without them.

31:03.243 --> 31:04.844
Step aside.

31:17.337 --> 31:20.025
<i>STEPHEN: (THINKING) Cara,
my uncle's gonna kill him.</i>

31:20.560 --> 31:22.828
<i>No, he's not.</i>

31:23.730 --> 31:25.331
<i>What did you do?</i>

31:25.632 --> 31:27.334
No. No.

31:28.022 --> 31:30.925
JEDIKIAH: (WHISPERING) I don't know
about you, but this is very exciting.

31:31.638 --> 31:33.338
You're gonna do well. You're gonna do well.

31:37.884 --> 31:39.511
May I say goodbye first?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.047
Indeed.

31:45.285 --> 31:46.785
You ready, brother?

31:48.832 --> 31:50.570
If you think it's for the best.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.354
I do.

31:55.389 --> 31:57.062
(WHISPERING) Waistband.

32:02.435 --> 32:03.735

Forget him. Let's go!

32:24.257 --> 32:25.857
(CHOKING) Hold your fire!

32:26.893 --> 32:29.234
What are you doing? Nathan!

32:29.240 --> 32:30.222
Finishing the job.

32:30.342 --> 32:31.974
STEPHEN: (GROANING) No,
you don't wanna do this.

32:32.011 --> 32:34.289
I could think of one
million reasons why I do.

32:34.301 --> 32:36.760
- We've gotta jump, let's go!
- No.

32:37.843 --> 32:38.950
NATHAN: You thought...

32:38.952 --> 32:41.319
You thought you could convince
me to betray my own brother?

32:43.780 --> 32:45.751
What do you know about the bond of blood?

32:45.871 --> 32:46.825
(HILLARY GRUNTING)

32:49.505 --> 32:51.225
No, no, no, no, no!

No.

32:56.825 --> 32:59.437
(BREATHING HEAVILY) You've
carried me long enough.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.544
(SOBBING) No.

33:19.881 --> 33:21.620
(EXHALING) You let him get away.

33:26.647 --> 33:28.366
(PANTING) Why'd you let him go?

33:32.104 --> 33:33.804
You let him get away.

33:45.399 --> 33:46.766
(KNOCKING)

33:46.982 --> 33:49.535
Saving my life earns you free entry.

33:50.599 --> 33:52.505
No knock required, Stephen.

33:52.801 --> 33:54.607
Saved your life a few times, now.

33:54.609 --> 33:56.509
Well, it goes both ways, right?

33:57.377 --> 33:59.612
I trust Astrid is getting over her trauma.

34:01.615 --> 34:04.551
What was so important about those twins?

34:05.277 --> 34:08.353
I've, um, never seen you like that.

34:09.523 --> 34:12.625
You must forgive me
for losing my composure.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.728
It's just the perfect case study.

34:16.231 --> 34:18.721
Two specimens, almost identical,

34:18.734 --> 34:22.534
offers us the chance to study the
gene that makes you so special.

34:26.616 --> 34:29.542
Any scientist would've killed
for the chance to study them.

34:31.511 --> 34:33.612
Perhaps a poor choice of words.

34:34.092 --> 34:36.563
Or maybe a scientist who himself

34:36.684 --> 34:38.091
had a paranormal brother.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.185
Hmm.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.989
Well, I'm sure my own
personal history probably

34:43.165 --> 34:45.542
fueled my interest subconsciously.

34:45.661 --> 34:47.693
I think it's a little more than that.

34:47.994 --> 34:49.061
Meaning?

34:50.166 --> 34:53.800
When I asked you what happened to
my father's body after he was killed,

34:54.367 --> 34:55.949
you said you cremated him.

34:56.069 --> 34:57.101
I did.

34:57.337 --> 34:58.637
Why?

34:58.937 --> 35:01.183
You are so excited about the possibility

35:01.214 --> 35:03.391
of transferring powers between siblings.

35:03.454 --> 35:05.387
You're telling me that you didn't wanna

35:05.507 --> 35:07.227
study your own brother?

35:07.240 --> 35:09.414
See if it was possible to gain his powers?

35:09.824 --> 35:12.408
I value my humanity, Stephen.

35:12.908 --> 35:16.221
And he was my brother. Not a lab rat.

35:16.875 --> 35:19.458
I shouldn't have to explain
those feelings to you.

35:43.351 --> 35:44.850
You have something for me?

35:45.451 --> 35:47.236
I'm not sure you earned it.

35:48.054 --> 35:49.988
You didn't finish the job, Cyrus.

35:50.327 --> 35:52.579
Your boy, Stephen,

35:52.699 --> 35:55.426
got in the way, and now my brother's dead.

35:55.546 --> 35:58.396
(SNIFFING) So, yeah, I'd say we earned it.

to do our dirty work?

36:22.655 --> 36:25.190
What'd you do, give him
my gun from the lair?

36:28.661 --> 36:32.063
You know, I have always
admired your resolve.

36:33.198 --> 36:35.533
But this time, you've gone too far.

36:37.552 --> 36:40.638
I had a chance to take
out Jedikiah. I took it.

36:41.273 --> 36:42.840
Would you listen to yourself?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.578
You still care for Jedikiah.

36:48.514 --> 36:50.281
Or else you'd see I'm right.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.788
Cyrus asked me something.

36:59.827 --> 37:02.523
If there was anyone in
my life I would sacrifice

37:02.774 --> 37:04.144
everything for.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.732
It's you.

37:13.338 --> 37:14.872
You're my family.

37:21.179 --> 37:22.713
Come back with me.

37:26.976 --> 37:30.017
So that you could have an
assassin at your disposal?

37:30.355 --> 37:31.822
No thanks.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.793
No, John, that's not what I...

37:36.895 --> 37:38.395
I miss you.

37:59.084 --> 38:00.350
Hey.

38:01.419 --> 38:02.653
Hey.

38:04.222 --> 38:05.756
What are you doing up?

38:06.191 --> 38:07.658
Waiting for you.

38:08.159 --> 38:09.793
Is everything okay?

38:11.329 --> 38:12.796
You tell me.

38:14.532 --> 38:16.400
Yeah, everything's fine.

38:16.968 --> 38:18.368
For now.

38:19.237 --> 38:21.571
For now is about as good as we can hope.

38:23.107 --> 38:24.408
(SIGHING)

38:25.576 --> 38:27.978
John told me what you're doing at Ultra.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.981
The war that you're fighting.

38:32.417 --> 38:35.452
- After everything I did to try to keep you safe.
- Mom.

38:36.453 --> 38:40.490
(SIGHING) I always resented your father for
choosing the fight over our family, but...

38:41.592 --> 38:43.326
Maybe I was wrong.

38:47.832 --> 38:51.419
Mom, everything that I'm
doing is for this family.

38:51.607 --> 38:52.502
I know.

38:53.202 --> 38:54.525
And I'm proud of you.

38:54.528 --> 38:56.749
You're a born leader, just like your

38:57.341 --> 38:59.075
pain-in-the-ass father.

39:02.002 --> 39:03.513
So we can stay.

39:04.315 --> 39:06.649
And you can keep working at Ultra.

39:06.989 --> 39:08.785
Because I know it's important.

39:10.054 --> 39:12.355
But I can't stop being your mom.

39:13.657 --> 39:15.817
I need to provide some

39:15.992 --> 39:18.751
semblance of a normal
life for you and Luca.

39:19.864 --> 39:21.164
I know.

39:21.532 --> 39:23.011
Luca needs it.

39:25.636 --> 39:26.970
So do I.

39:28.205 --> 39:31.574
But the days of burying my
head in the sand are over.

39:32.142 --> 39:33.810
I know you're in danger.

39:33.812 --> 39:35.044
At Ultra.

39:35.772 --> 39:38.031
So every night, when you come home,

39:38.306 --> 39:39.758
I'll be waiting.

39:40.196 --> 39:43.252
Because I won't be able to rest
until I know that you're safe.

39:46.123 --> 39:47.523
I'm safe.

39:48.892 --> 39:50.226
For now.

39:54.298 --> 39:56.632
That's gonna have to be good enough.

39:58.201 --> 39:59.735
Good night, Mom.

40:25.996 --> 40:27.730
I was so close.

40:29.132 --> 40:30.699
So close.

40:31.782 --> 40:35.348
I had the perfect two candidates,
and somehow, I just let 'em

40:35.373 --> 40:37.239
slip through my fingers.

40:40.310 --> 40:42.244
Well, you know what that means.

40:43.413 --> 40:46.482
You and I are going to have
to put our plans on hold.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.317
Again.

40:52.088 --> 40:53.589
I'm so sorry.

41:05.034 --> 41:07.636
Oh, yeah, you know, I forgot to tell you.

41:07.971 --> 41:09.237
Your son.

41:09.639 --> 41:11.139
Sharp kid.

41:11.774 --> 41:13.508
He's looking for you.

41:14.243 --> 41:16.211
He's getting closer every day.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.881
You'd tell me if he tried to
contact you in any way, wouldn't you?

41:22.218 --> 41:25.587
You know what happens when we
keep secrets from each other.

41:28.124 --> 41:29.324
Okay.

41:30.893 --> 41:32.460
Anyway.

41:34.030 --> 41:35.864
Good night, little brother.
