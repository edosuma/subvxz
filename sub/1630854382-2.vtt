00:00.913 --> 00:01.610
<i>Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.697 --> 00:04.613
<i>David Hasselhoff
was everywhere.</i>

00:04.787 --> 00:06.876
<i>He rocked the free world
in those red shorts
on the beach.</i>

00:07.050 --> 00:09.792
<i>And no one worshipped the Hoff
more than my brother, Barry.</i>

00:09.966 --> 00:12.099
JTP! Plus assorted lessers.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.405
JTP!
Plus assorted lessers.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.277
Barry, we are not your lessers.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.453
- We're parents--
- Shh. I'm talking.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.367
Okay.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.152
What'd I just taste
on that finger?

00:22.326 --> 00:23.762
Either marmalade
or Laffy Taffy.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.286
Why do we keep
coming over here?

00:25.460 --> 00:28.115
Let me answer that question
with a question:

00:28.289 --> 00:30.682
Do you guys know
who's in Philadelphia
right now?

00:30.856 --> 00:32.162
- The mayor?
- The Oak Ridge Boys?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.816
I have no guess,
but I'm excited.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.472
America's most dynamic film
and TV star, David Hasselhoff!

00:37.646 --> 00:39.039
Morning gravy!

00:39.213 --> 00:40.692
I love him in <i>Knight Rider.</i>

00:40.866 --> 00:43.739
Making the audience believe
that you have a complicated,

00:43.913 --> 00:46.133
emotional relationship
with a car?

00:46.307 --> 00:47.308
That's acting, folks.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.918
Bill gets it.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.138
He's here,
and I need his autograph.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.183
How exactly
can <i>we</i> help you with this?

00:53.357 --> 00:55.011
That's for you to answer, Ginzy.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.883
Now, let's get those
little noggins cranking.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.148
There are no bad ideas,
but, uh, Matt Bradley,
sit this one out.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.714
That's not the punishment
you think it is.

01:02.888 --> 01:05.804
Great, you're all here.
We have got a lot to go over.

01:05.978 --> 01:06.892
- Barry, take a seat.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.372
Why would I sit?

01:08.546 --> 01:10.244
This is my meeting
to brainstorm

01:10.418 --> 01:12.376
how I can meet
and befriend David Hasselhoff.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.161
No, it's my meeting
to brainstorm

01:14.335 --> 01:16.250
how the community
can come together

01:16.424 --> 01:18.469
to fill the void in Mom's heart
when I go to college in a week.

01:18.643 --> 01:19.775
I was invited to both meetings.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.733
It's a neat feeling.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.780
Adam, you don't need to worry.
Your mom is ready for this.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.826
You're just projecting
how you feel about
Chad going to college.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.263
You gotta remember,

01:29.437 --> 01:31.178
my mom loves me way more
than you love your son.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.049
Enough!

01:33.223 --> 01:36.052
We are not here to discuss
Ginzy's shaky family relationships.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.923
I want to hear some ideas.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.838
JTP, hit me!

01:40.012 --> 01:41.449
You could write a letter
to his fan club?

01:41.623 --> 01:43.668
That's how I got
Captain Kangaroo's J. Hancock.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.017
Now on to me!

01:45.192 --> 01:47.629
The key to helping Mom
will be to distract her.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.500
She may not care about
you all that much,

01:49.674 --> 01:50.936
but she's always game
for meddling

01:51.111 --> 01:52.373
in someone else's business.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.983
Bill, what's going on
in your life?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.072
Well, Dolores and I
are remodeling our kitchen.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.596
-  Ooh.
- I could ask Bev
to pick out knobs.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.903
Hmm, we need something
more personal.

02:01.077 --> 02:04.080
More personal than knobs? Okay.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.257
What if you confided in her
that you and Dolores
are having issues?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.780
You two have seemed
distant lately.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.391
- We have?
- She looks
right past you, Bill.

02:10.565 --> 02:11.348
Everyone sees it.

02:11.522 --> 02:12.349
Aww.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.700
Oh, look,

02:15.874 --> 02:19.835
you've all come over
to watch me bravely take on
my new life as a widow.

02:20.009 --> 02:23.012
Not at all. We're actually here
because Smiley Glasses

02:23.186 --> 02:24.796
thinks you're going
to be heartbroken
when he goes to college.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.016
Aww.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.670
You've been through
a lot this year.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.541
I thought maybe everyone
could help out somehow.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.892
That is so sweet of you all
to support me in this way.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.459
And, you know,
there is one thing

02:35.633 --> 02:37.548
that really would feed my soul.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.247
Nom-noms from my Schmoo.
Mom, no!

02:40.421 --> 02:42.205
Come on,
you've only got a week left.
You're gonna miss this.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.946
- Aw!
- You're gonna miss it!

02:44.120 --> 02:46.122
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪</i>

02:46.296 --> 02:48.733
<i>♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say ♪</i>

02:51.910 --> 02:53.651
<i>♪ I don't know the future ♪</i>

02:53.825 --> 02:56.828
<i>♪ But the past keeps
Getting clearer every day ♪</i>

02:57.002 --> 02:59.483
<i>It was
September 28th, 1980-something,</i>

02:59.657 --> 03:02.225
<i>and Erica and Geoff
were crossing
an important milestone.</i>

03:02.399 --> 03:03.922
<i>They were about to learn
the sex of their baby.</i>

03:04.096 --> 03:05.054
This is so exciting.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.011
And it's not that I'm rooting

03:06.186 --> 03:07.187
for it to be a girl,

03:07.361 --> 03:08.231
but I could really use a break

03:08.405 --> 03:09.667
from all the mohel interviews.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.103
I think I'm nervous.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.714
I know your mom just wants
to find the right guy,

03:12.888 --> 03:14.281
but a dozen in-depth
discussions

03:14.455 --> 03:16.935
about ritual circumcision
seems like too many.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.589
Of course, your pacing
isn't helping.

03:18.763 --> 03:19.634
She also says
"penis" and "foreskin"

03:19.808 --> 03:21.201
way more than is necessary.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.724
Like, we all get the procedure.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.552
Okay, Geoff, sit down!

03:24.726 --> 03:26.162
Sorry, I-I guess
we're both nervous.

03:26.336 --> 03:26.858
But it's gonna be okay.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.164
Hey, you two.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.296
Dr. B!

03:29.470 --> 03:29.992
Please don't call me that.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.255
...O-W-M-A-N. Bowman.

03:32.429 --> 03:32.995
With "doctor" in front.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.475
Dr. Bowman. Saved it!

03:34.649 --> 03:36.128
You're gonna be a weird dad.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.217
You ready to hear
what you're having?

03:37.391 --> 03:38.174
- Yes, we are.
- We're gonna pass.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.307
- Okay.
- Um, hon?

03:40.481 --> 03:42.570
Look, I-I know we wanted
to find out the sex.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.745
But I don't want to
find out the sex.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.399
So let's not find out the sex.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.096
But we've been
discussing this for months.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.967
Which is exactly why
we're gonna hear it!

03:49.141 --> 03:49.925
Another time.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.319
- Erica.
- Okay, Bowman, go.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.103
- Now stop!
- Oh, geez.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.322
Boy or girl? Spill it!

03:55.496 --> 03:56.932
- And you die!
- Okay, okay.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.847
What's going on?

03:59.021 --> 04:00.762
'Cause I thought that you were
excited about finding out.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.113
I was, but suddenly
it seems too soon.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.376
I don't want to know
until the baby's
really here. I'm sorry.

04:06.550 --> 04:07.682
Call me when you figure it out.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.249
Okay, we will. Or we won't.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.511
I guess that's your point.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.426
Yay, parenting!
It's already hard.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.775
<i>
While Erica had flip-flopped</i>

04:13.949 --> 04:15.080
<i>on finding out
the sex of their baby,</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:17.300
<i>I was still concerned
my mom would flip out</i>

04:17.474 --> 04:18.780
<i>when I went to NYU.</i>

04:18.954 --> 04:20.608
Hey, Mr. Glascott,
got a second?

04:20.782 --> 04:22.479
For a recent graduate
who's off my books?

04:22.653 --> 04:23.828
Absolutely not.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.874
Shut the door behind you,
and have a great life.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.485
Please!

04:28.659 --> 04:30.487
Adam, I just spent
the last hour

04:30.661 --> 04:31.749
at the Home Ec sewing machine

04:31.923 --> 04:33.447
altering my own pants

04:33.621 --> 04:35.710
so they could fit
a third grader who wet himself.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
I need this Cinnabon bad.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.583
But I'm really worried
about my mom.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.585
I need you to have a heartfelt
one-on-one with her.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.196
Well, as you know, heartfelt
one-on-ones are kinda my thing.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.589
I know she's gonna be devastated

04:45.763 --> 04:47.417
when I go away to NYU,

04:47.591 --> 04:49.680
but she's putting on
a brave face.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.421
Can you find out
how she's really feeling?

04:51.595 --> 04:53.858
As an admired and esteemed
guidance counselor,

04:55.120 --> 04:56.644
the best man is on the job.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.820
Odd. I've never seen
your legs before.

04:58.994 --> 04:59.995
Well, we all have them.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.519
Some are just skinnier
than others.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.216
And do not touch that Cinnabon.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.697
<i>And so,
Mr. Glascott went to see</i>

05:06.871 --> 05:09.178
<i>if he could figure out
what was really going on
in my mom's heart.</i>

05:09.352 --> 05:10.397
Hey, John. How are you?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.268
- Not lonely. You?
- What?

05:12.442 --> 05:14.183
Adam's gonna be gone soon.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.403
And I was wondering
how you're feeling

05:16.577 --> 05:18.970
about living with
nothing but the echoes
of his footsteps.

05:19.144 --> 05:23.366
Oh, I'll miss him,
of course, but it's time,
you know?

05:23.540 --> 05:27.109
- It is. So, what if
you fall down?
- Fall down?

05:27.283 --> 05:30.199
You're making sauce,
it splatters,
you slip and fall.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.854
Next thing you know,
you're lying on your back,
legs akimbo.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.726
- I would never spill my sauce.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.120
Unless it's on
a bed of linguine
with Parmed shrimp.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.122
Sounds delicious.
I'll be by later.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.776
But my point is,

05:41.950 --> 05:44.866
you're alone and helpless
because Adam isn't there.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.216
Well, what about Barry?
Or Geoff, or Erica?

05:47.390 --> 05:48.609
Or my father-in-law?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.393
- They're at a movie.
- So? They'll be home soon.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.612
It's <i>The Right Stuff.</i>

05:51.786 --> 05:53.135
Running time
is over three hours.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.136
I'll pull the phone down.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.138
- It's dead.
- Why?

05:56.312 --> 05:58.314
You were overwhelmed
with loneliness
and forgot to pay the bill.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.837
Your world has gone dark.

06:00.011 --> 06:00.882
Tell me I'm wrong, Beverly.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.667
You are! I <i>am</i> ready for this!

06:03.841 --> 06:05.887
And when I am alone,
I will tell myself,

06:06.061 --> 06:08.411
if my friend John
can handle it, then so can I.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.195
- Me?
- Yes!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.110
I mean, you're alone
almost every day,
and you manage.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.635
Sure, you've got that bird,
but it's not a person.

06:14.809 --> 06:15.636
Well, she says stuff.

06:15.810 --> 06:16.898
She repeats stuff.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.421
Uh-huh.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.075
I got a lot to re-examine.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.164
Thank you for always
thinking of me.
It means so much.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.383
Whatever.

06:25.341 --> 06:26.995
- How'd it go?

06:27.169 --> 06:29.258
The woman is a fortress
of hidden emotions.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.086
She's got all of her walls up,

06:31.260 --> 06:32.957
and they are deflecting things
back at innocent people.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.613
-  Get out of here.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.746
<i>While my mom
was holding back her feelings,</i>

06:38.920 --> 06:40.878
<i>Geoff's parents couldn't
contain their excitement.</i>

06:41.052 --> 06:42.445
Aah, big faces!

06:42.619 --> 06:44.186
- What is it? Boy or girl?
- Reveal!

06:44.360 --> 06:46.057
Yeah, we decided
not to find out.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.408
-  me!
- Oh, oh, Lou, calm down.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.714
You calm down!
I want a gender, Linda!

06:50.888 --> 06:52.890
If the kids decide that
they don't want to know,

06:53.064 --> 06:54.501
we have to respect that.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.460
Is it what you and Erica want,
Geoffy? Or just Erica?

06:57.634 --> 06:59.201
Because this has
all the hallmarks

06:59.375 --> 07:01.899
of a classic
Goldbergian flip-flop.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.553
- What are you talking about?
- It's how they control us.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.294
Remember our last dinner there?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.949
Beverly said
we'd be having chicken.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.385
Then what did she serve?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.691
Salmon!

07:10.865 --> 07:12.693
I had fish sticks for lunch.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.651
All that planning
was out the window!

07:14.825 --> 07:16.479
Erica did
lead the charge on this,

07:16.653 --> 07:19.221
but I do have something fun
for you guys.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.049
- It's a sonogram picture
of your grandchild!

07:21.223 --> 07:23.921
Oh! Ah! How cute!

07:24.095 --> 07:25.836
- Where's my jeweler's loupe?
- Jeweler's loupe?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.838
He uses it now
for his new hobby.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.667
He paints pewter
Civil War figurines.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.757
And, yes,
it's as exciting as it sounds.

07:33.931 --> 07:37.326
Oh, and mustard tasting
with your sisters
is Mardi Gras?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.067
- A-ha!
- What is it?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.678
Would you like to know
the sex of your child?

07:41.852 --> 07:43.550
Uh, but Erica--

07:43.724 --> 07:45.465
Sure, she makes
the big decisions for you.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.293
But if you're interested...

07:53.603 --> 07:56.040
You see that tiny protrusion
right there?

07:57.389 --> 07:59.740
- Is that...
- He's a Schwartz man!

07:59.914 --> 08:00.654
- Really?
-  Yes!

08:00.828 --> 08:03.221
Ahh!

08:03.395 --> 08:05.572
Son of my son.

08:05.746 --> 08:09.097
Made in the image of all
the Schwartzes before him
in all our limited glory!

08:09.271 --> 08:11.969
Oh, yes, <i>
that</i> is a Schwartz man.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.014
I'm having a boy?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.711
The name lives on!

08:19.020 --> 08:22.023
Now all you have to do is keep
this secret from your wife
for the next few months.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.155
<i>While Geoff
had to keep a secret,</i>

08:24.329 --> 08:26.854
<i>I was figuring out
how to keep my mom happy.</i>

08:27.028 --> 08:29.509
Okay, so, in a week,
we're set to head off
to NYU together.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.381
On our own, starting
our adult lives together.

08:32.555 --> 08:36.037
But I won't be attending,
so you'll be going alone.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.256
- Wait, what?
- I'm deferring for a year.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.520
Dude, I chose NYU
so we could go together.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.825
To share our adventure?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.827
I talked to student housing,

08:44.001 --> 08:46.874
and you're gonna be
sharing your adventure
with Yuri Agapov.

08:47.048 --> 08:50.617
He's enrolled in the school's
Elder Education
Foreign Exchange program.

08:50.791 --> 08:54.359
My freshman-year roommate
is some old Russian dude?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.624
I'm sorry. But maybe you can
distract yourself by coming up
with ideas to tell my mom

08:57.798 --> 08:59.713
why I'm not going with you.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.193
Sorry, I'm a little preoccupied
thinking about
how you ruined my life.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.021
Lives get ruined,
that's the way of the world.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.022
You eat the crap sandwich,

09:05.196 --> 09:06.154
you hope
the next one's smaller.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.504
But it never
works out that way.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.288
- He is not like
your other grandpa.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.290
What are you doing
with that chalkboard?

09:12.464 --> 09:13.988
Just a little
brainstorming sesh.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.904
But I brought the JTP here
for <i>my</i> brainstorming sesh.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.428
Brainstorming? You told us
you invented a new pizza.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.170
Yeah, barbecue ribs,
fried rice, and taco.

09:22.344 --> 09:23.780
It seems like too many flavors,
but now we'll never know.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.303
JTP, shh!

09:25.477 --> 09:26.609
JTP, shh!

09:26.783 --> 09:28.393
I heard the Hasselhoff movie

09:28.568 --> 09:30.178
is hiring locals
to run errands.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.136
So why are we here?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.225
I need you to give me tips
to make me look
like a pathetic loser

09:34.399 --> 09:35.836
that would fetch coffee
for Hollywood people.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.577
Why would <i>we</i> know anything
about being a loser?

09:37.751 --> 09:38.882
No reason.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.884
Just tell me where you buy
your clothes

09:41.058 --> 09:42.407
and how you live your lives,
and I'll take it from there.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.192
- Super hurtful.
- Not cool.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.802
Mostly Sears.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.936
Barry gave me an idea,
Dave Kim.
Follow me to my car.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.852
What happens if I commit
and then you just decide
not to go to your car?

09:52.026 --> 09:52.766
Huh? Huh?

09:54.550 --> 09:56.508
We can do better
than these people.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.902
<i>Yep, I was armed
with a brilliant plan:</i>

09:59.076 --> 10:01.557
<i>hassle the Hoff
by sneaking into his trailer.</i>

10:01.731 --> 10:03.428
Hello? Mr. Hasselhoff?

10:05.213 --> 10:06.257
He's not here.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477
Good.
I'm rooting for you to fail.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.479
Although this is kinda cool.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.524
We're in the Hoff's
inner sanctum.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.353
To think, this is where
he works on his craft

10:15.527 --> 10:17.007
and brushes his lustrous mane.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.792
Holy crap,
his <i>Knight Rider</i> jacket.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.360
- Whoa.
- So rugged yet supple.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.101
That's full grain, baby.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.364
Softer than
my mother's nightgown.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.105
- Softer than both of
our mothers' nightgowns.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.238
Why are you boys
being weird in my trailer?

10:30.412 --> 10:33.154
Hello, Mr. Hasselhoff, sir.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.982
Wow, you look
even buffer in person.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.940
Thank you. The secret
is to be born beautiful.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.899
It is an honor.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.117
And if it wasn't
for <i>Knight Rider</i>

10:40.291 --> 10:41.771
and the way you handled KITT,

10:41.945 --> 10:43.904
I may never have mustered up
the courage to learn to drive.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.558
Please leave.

10:46.733 --> 10:50.127
Before we go, may I offer you
my humble services
as your on-set assistant?

10:50.301 --> 10:52.739
No, now beat it before
I have you both arrested.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.176
<i>So,
my plan failed,
but I wasn't done yet.</i>

10:55.350 --> 10:58.614
I won't give up!
You'll love my perseverance!

10:58.788 --> 11:01.617
But you should know that
I have a note from my doctor
about lifting things.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
Out, out, out, out, out, out!

11:06.187 --> 11:08.798
<i>Geoff knew
something he shouldn't,</i>

11:08.972 --> 11:11.192
<i>and the hard part?
Keeping his mouth shut.</i>

11:11.366 --> 11:13.977
Listen. I know
you guys decided against

11:14.151 --> 11:15.239
finding out
the sex of the baby,

11:15.413 --> 11:17.198
but just in case,

11:17.372 --> 11:18.852
the search
for the right mohel continues.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.854
More mohels. Yay.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.639
If it's a boy,
the foreskin and penis
will be the stars of the show.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.510
Can't wait to see that show.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.338
Ooh, look at the time.
I'm supposed to meet
Ginzy at foreskin.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.818
Oh, I mean 4:00.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.733
Oh! Someone's got
foreskin on the brain.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.822
You okay, hon?

11:32.996 --> 11:34.345
I know you really wanted
to find out today.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.478
Oh, I'm fine.
As long as you're happy.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.654
Also I found out
the sex of the baby.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.830
- What?
- I-It's my dad's fault.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.093
He saw the sonogram,
and he is a doctor,

11:43.267 --> 11:44.834
and he held this lens-thingy
with his own eye socket.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.270
Wow. You know what you are?

11:46.444 --> 11:47.228
- A bad boy?
- That's right.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.099
And what happens to bad boys?

11:49.273 --> 11:50.579
They get punished
'cause they did bad.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.973
See, you know the sex
of our baby, but guess what?

11:53.147 --> 11:54.278
I forbid you to tell me.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.541
I can't keep this to myself!

11:56.716 --> 12:00.545
Until our baby is born,
you will carry this burden
with you day after day,

12:00.720 --> 12:03.070
knowing it was forged
in the fires of your betrayal.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.854
Please don't do this to me!
Wait, where are you going?

12:05.028 --> 12:07.378
Out. So you can be alone
with your thoughts.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.641
Alone with my thoughts?
But that's when a bad boy
feels baddest!

12:09.816 --> 12:11.600
Remember, you did this.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.558
And I would never
do that to you.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.082
<i>
But she totally would.</i>

12:15.256 --> 12:18.259
I need Dr. Bowman to tell me
the sex of my baby now.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.304
Also, my husband
can never know I was here.

12:20.478 --> 12:23.394
And if he finds out,
I'll know that someone
in this room is a rat.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.136
Ma'am, Dr. Bowman
is in delivery.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.790
Fine. I'm sure
the info's in my file.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.314
It must be one of these, right?

12:30.488 --> 12:32.403
Not me, not me, not me.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.058
Ma'am, it's not there.
What was your name again?

12:35.232 --> 12:35.885
Erica Goldberg.

12:38.148 --> 12:38.975
Thank you.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.370
Oh, my God.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.328
<i>While Erica
knew what she was having,</i>

12:44.502 --> 12:46.896
<i>I was having a hard time
telling my mom the truth.</i>

12:47.070 --> 12:48.637
I got a job
with David Hasselhoff.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.031
<i>I did not get a job
with David Hasselhoff.</i>

12:51.205 --> 12:52.815
Adam, what are you
talking about?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.469
It sounds too good to be true.

12:54.643 --> 12:55.731
<i>It was.</i>

12:55.905 --> 12:56.993
But I'm his new
personal assistant.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.690
<i>Again, I was not.</i>

12:58.865 --> 13:00.431
What the hell does
a personal assistant do?

13:00.605 --> 13:03.304
You pick up dry cleaning,
roll up turkey slices,

13:03.478 --> 13:05.088
maybe visit with a sick parent

13:05.262 --> 13:06.698
if it conflicts with
an important drinks meeting.

13:06.873 --> 13:07.917
So you'll be
helping an [bleep]?

13:08.091 --> 13:09.963
That's just how
Hollywood works, babe.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.008
And it's a great way
to get my foot in the door
and learn the biz.

13:12.182 --> 13:15.011
But you go to NYU in a week.
You can't start a job now.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.578
Especially
since it doesn't exist.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.755
The Hoff, like myself,

13:19.929 --> 13:22.366
is the kind of man
other men want to be.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.892
I know how he dreams,
how he thinks, how he sniffs.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.850
Like this.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.809
See? Effortless.

13:29.983 --> 13:30.897
What are you talking about?

13:31.071 --> 13:32.768
He'd never hire
a dork like you.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.204
Then why do I have this?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.641
The script pages
they're shooting that day.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.601
Face it.
David and I are best buds now.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.951
Our wives
will have to get along
on our joint vacations

13:42.125 --> 13:44.040
even though
they despise each other.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.347
I demand you introduce me
so I can have the life
you are describing.

13:46.521 --> 13:47.957
Absolutely not.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.568
Part of my job is to make sure
people like you

13:50.742 --> 13:52.005
don't get anywhere
near David Hasselhoff.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.484
Damn it!

13:53.658 --> 13:55.443
That sounds like something
David would do.

13:55.617 --> 13:59.708
Look, if you leave right now,
silently and without a scene,

13:59.882 --> 14:00.622
maybe I'll get you
his autograph.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.631
I'm still not sold, Adam.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.851
Your father always said,
"There's nothing more important
than college."

14:12.025 --> 14:14.375
I'll still go.
After I defer a year.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.985
I called NYU.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.161
They said the job
would count as school credit.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.684
<i>They couldn't
because there was no job.</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:21.164
- Really?
- Yes.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.600
<i>Not even a little.</i>

14:22.774 --> 14:24.689
It's like
the perfect situation.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.301
And, I mean,
it's David Hasselhoff.

14:27.475 --> 14:28.911
And who better
to teach you about life
than a Hollywood actor?

14:29.085 --> 14:30.173
Well...

14:30.347 --> 14:31.044
Is that a yes, Mama?

14:32.088 --> 14:33.089
I guess so.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.700
<i>My lies worked.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.268
<i>Meanwhile, Erica
was working over Geoff
for betraying her trust.</i>

14:38.442 --> 14:40.357
Here you go.
Nachos from your favorite
Tex-Mex joint.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.968
-  It's ringing.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.492
Hello?

14:45.493 --> 14:46.711
Uh-huh. Thanks.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.413
That was the doctor's office.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.197
You, uh,
left your sunglasses there

14:54.371 --> 14:55.895
when you went by to find out
the sex of the baby?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.157
Oh, [bleep].

14:57.331 --> 14:58.593
You've been making me
feel guilty

14:58.767 --> 15:00.203
and running me all over town

15:00.377 --> 15:01.813
when you did
the same thing I did?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.251
I only wanted to know
after you knew!

15:04.425 --> 15:05.730
I could have just told you
what I knew!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.123
I didn't want you to know
that I knew!

15:07.297 --> 15:09.212
I knew you wanted to know.
I just knew it!

15:09.386 --> 15:11.258
I knew that you knew
that I wanted to know,

15:11.432 --> 15:13.303
but you had still known
before I hadn't known anything!

15:13.477 --> 15:15.088
And you knew that was wrong!

15:15.262 --> 15:16.480
Well, it's also wrong
to pretend not to know

15:16.654 --> 15:17.786
when you knew what was known!

15:17.960 --> 15:20.267
Well, it was still unknown
until I knew it,

15:20.441 --> 15:22.704
but that was after you knew
what I didn't want to know.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.706
- I know!
- And now I know!

15:24.880 --> 15:26.316
So we can just say it
and know together!

15:26.490 --> 15:27.883
- We're having a boy!
- We're having a girl!

15:28.057 --> 15:29.319
- What?
- What?

15:29.493 --> 15:31.495
<i>The sex
remained a mystery,</i>

15:31.669 --> 15:34.324
<i>but what wasn't a mystery
was that my mom was going
to interfere in my life.</i>

15:34.498 --> 15:37.066
Welcome to the family,
Mr. Hasselhoff!

15:37.240 --> 15:39.286
- What the h--
- I'm Adam's mom.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.375
- Adam?
- Yeah.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.507
The little piece of pottery
that I baked in my lady kiln
18 years ago.

15:43.681 --> 15:44.856
Lady kiln?

15:45.031 --> 15:48.077
Oh, poor thing, you seem off.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.297
Did you have
a rough day on set?

15:50.471 --> 15:51.994
Listen, why don't I give you
some shrimp Parm

15:52.168 --> 15:53.691
and then you can go shluffie?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.171
Lady, what's happening here?

15:55.345 --> 15:57.434
You know Adam,
your new assistant.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.001
Remember? I baked him in here.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.047
I don't have a new assistant.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.614
Glasses,
golden locks like sunshine?

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
A million-watt smile
that would melt an iceberg?

16:05.877 --> 16:08.315
I know who you think
you're talking about, and no.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.494
Well, why would he lie to me?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.583
I'm sorry, Mr. Hasselhoff,
I got to figure this out.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.763
- Ah.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.158
<i>Geoff and Erica
still didn't know</i>

16:25.245 --> 16:26.811
<i>if they were having
a boy or a girl,</i>

16:26.898 --> 16:28.639
<i>and it was time
to find out the truth.</i>

16:28.813 --> 16:30.380
So, this is the sonogram

16:30.554 --> 16:31.903
your father,
the ophthalmologist,

16:32.078 --> 16:33.731
was looking at
when he determined
you were having a boy?

16:33.905 --> 16:37.387
And the appendage
in question was, um,

16:37.561 --> 16:39.737
reminiscent in the style
of most Schwartz men.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.522
Yeah, that's a pinky.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.176
Yeah, it is pink, isn't it?

16:43.350 --> 16:45.134
But don't worry,
it'll cool down
to a pale chiffon.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.093
I meant, that's not a penis.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.617
Well, it's not much,
but it'll still do
what it needs to.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.184
He's saying
it's a pinky finger, dumb-dumb.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.012
Ohh.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.230
So it is a girl?

16:54.404 --> 16:55.101
Because...

16:55.275 --> 16:56.580
The "F" on my chart.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.104
For "Female"?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.671
And who else on your chart
could be female?

17:00.845 --> 17:01.585
Me?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.545
Ohh.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.938
When it comes to taking
care of this baby,
will you two have help?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.898
Okay, so we were both wrong.
Can you just tell us?

17:10.072 --> 17:11.682
I would, but someone
made a mess of our files,

17:11.856 --> 17:13.989
and the slip of paper with that
info hasn't been found.

17:14.163 --> 17:17.558
Well, that person
sounds fun and pretty.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.777
Today is your
high-resolution ultrasound.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.562
If you want to know,
I can tell you then.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.216
All right? You think about it.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.174
<i>As Geoff and Erica
had a decision to make,</i>

17:25.348 --> 17:28.264
<i>my mom knew exactly
what she wanted to say to me.</i>

17:28.438 --> 17:30.136
Home already, Schmoo?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.528
We wrapped early.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.400
The director threw a tantrum
about his smoothie

17:33.574 --> 17:34.575
and wouldn't come out
of his trailer.

17:34.749 --> 17:35.880
That's Hollyweird.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.927
Oh, balls!

17:39.101 --> 17:40.711
Your sweater would suggest
that you know

17:40.885 --> 17:43.149
I'm not actually working
with David Hasselhoff.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.151
Do you have any idea
how heartbreaking it was

17:45.325 --> 17:47.327
for me to bedazzle
this sweater, Adam?

17:47.501 --> 17:49.851
No, but it seems like
there might have been
an easier way to call me out.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.766
She's been ironing with her
back to the door for an hour.

17:51.940 --> 17:52.723
What's going on?

17:52.897 --> 17:53.855
Oh.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.161
This should be good.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.206
I went to see Mr. Hasselhoff

17:57.380 --> 17:59.643
to deliver a "thank you Parm"
for hiring Adam,

17:59.817 --> 18:01.123
but he made the whole thing up.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.777
My Schmoo is a this!

18:02.951 --> 18:04.083
A big fat this!

18:04.257 --> 18:07.173
You spoke to David Hasselhoff?

18:07.347 --> 18:10.176
How is everyone but me managing
to get so close to this guy?

18:10.350 --> 18:12.613
I don't know what's going on
in your head, Mr. This,

18:12.787 --> 18:15.746
but the first thing we're going
to do is re-enroll you at NYU.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.966
No! I can't leave you now.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.141
You've been through too much.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.360
I'll be okay.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.796
- You won't.
- Adam!

18:21.970 --> 18:22.449
I don't believe you!

18:23.493 --> 18:24.625
What is this about?

18:26.757 --> 18:29.369
It's just, <i>I'm</i> not ready.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.285
Okay?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.678
I'm not ready.
I thought I was,
but I'm just not.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.203
Sweetie.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.684
Losing Dad, it's been a lot.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.906
And now with Barry
and Pop-Pop here,

18:45.080 --> 18:46.473
and Geoff and Erica
having the baby,

18:48.605 --> 18:49.693
I'm finally feeling
almost good again.

18:51.173 --> 18:51.739
I don't want to give that up.

18:53.784 --> 18:54.959
Well, then you don't have to.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.135
Really?

18:56.309 --> 18:57.658
Yeah.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.399
NYU will be there
in another year.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.796
Sorry I tried to put it on you.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.537
I should have just admitted
how I was feeling.

19:07.711 --> 19:08.843
It's okay, Schmoo.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.018
We're all doing
the best we can.

19:11.280 --> 19:11.715
Confession!

19:13.369 --> 19:15.415
The reason I've been so crazy

19:15.589 --> 19:18.113
about getting
that autograph is, well,

19:18.287 --> 19:20.115
we used to watch <i>
Knight Rider</i> with Dad.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.726
He loved it as much as us,

19:22.900 --> 19:24.772
so I-I thought it'd be cool
to have something
that reminded me of that.

19:25.947 --> 19:26.513
You know what?

19:28.384 --> 19:29.907
You want an autograph?
Let's go get it.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.692
- For real?
- Yeah, I want to meet
this Hoff guy, too.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.563
Come on, Bar.

19:33.737 --> 19:34.869
Let's go break into
the poor man's trailer again.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.392
I'd love that.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.742
<i>It's funny.</i>

19:38.916 --> 19:42.137
<i>Sometimes the detours of life
can take us exactly
where we need to be.</i>

19:42.311 --> 19:43.791
<i>But it's also nice
when you're already
on the right path.</i>

19:44.879 --> 19:46.315
There it is.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.751
First live images of your baby.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.406
And everything's okay?

19:50.580 --> 19:51.842
It's perfect.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.280
And here is the heartbeat.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.240
Oh, my God.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.024
That's our baby.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.157
I just can't believe it.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.290
So, do you wanna know
if it's a boy or a girl?

20:06.335 --> 20:06.857
- Nope.
- No, thank you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.947
The baby's healthy.

20:10.121 --> 20:10.774
Erica's healthy.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.559
That's all that matters.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.562
<i>♪ She's driving away... ♪</i>

20:15.736 --> 20:16.911
<i>No matter
how much we plan,</i>

20:17.085 --> 20:19.043
<i>there will always be surprises.</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:23.309
<i>Some good, some bad,
and some you never
could have predicted.</i>

20:23.483 --> 20:24.875
I thought he was shorter.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.312
It's like looking in a mirror.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.835
We're gonna need an autograph.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.577
And I really think
you should hire my son.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.579
If you promise to never
come in this trailer again,

20:34.407 --> 20:36.147
I might be able to get him
a PA job on the set.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.758
- Really?
- But...

20:37.932 --> 20:39.499
He's got to bring me
more of that shrimp Parm.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.674
It's so good.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.502
-  Yes.

20:42.676 --> 20:43.764
<i>That's the thing
about family.</i>

20:43.938 --> 20:45.983
<i>When you lean on
the people you love,</i>

20:46.157 --> 20:48.595
<i>things tend to work out
in the end.</i>

20:48.769 --> 20:51.511
<i>And even your biggest dreams
can come true.</i>

20:51.685 --> 20:52.773
<i>♪ Let's go ♪</i>

20:58.561 --> 20:59.997
Ah, JTP,

21:00.084 --> 21:01.477
my barbecue rib,

21:01.564 --> 21:03.087
fried rice, taco pizza.

21:03.174 --> 21:03.958
Whoo!

21:04.132 --> 21:05.133
Buckle up and enjoy

21:05.307 --> 21:06.830
your international journey.

21:07.004 --> 21:10.660
It's both sweet and salty,
but also soft and crunchy,

21:10.834 --> 21:12.532
as if zero thought
was given to its assembly.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.881
Oh!

21:14.055 --> 21:15.361
I just bit
into something sharp.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.579
That's rib bone.

21:16.753 --> 21:17.580
I left them in

21:17.754 --> 21:18.755
for some extra flavor.

21:18.929 --> 21:19.974
That explains why
my slice is so heavy.

21:20.148 --> 21:20.975
Pizza can be anything.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.106
Not in this case.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.499
Move! I'm outta here!

21:23.673 --> 21:24.674
I'll finish his.

21:26.241 --> 21:26.894
Ew.

21:28.461 --> 21:29.157
Not bad.
