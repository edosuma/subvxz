PENNYWORTH#110
"Marianne Faithful"
Closed Captioned

00:10.880 --> 00:14.971
I hereby introduce our
new leader, Lord James Harwood.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.409
LADY HARWOOD:
Welcome home, my love.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.324
HARWOOD:
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.847
You seem troubled.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.327
We'd given you up for dead.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.112
I-I feel like I'm dreaming.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.333
MRS. PENNYWORTH:
Your dad's got cancer.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.944
He's dying.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.556
ALFRED: I'm looking for
Captain John Curzon.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.167
This man has killed my fiancée.Sorry, love.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.692
The PM wants you buried alive.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.086
Seven years. Take him down.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.348
Things are going
to get pretty nasty.

00:44.392 --> 00:45.741
I'm not sure you
should be involved.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.264
That's exactly why you...I can't stop you

00:47.308 --> 00:48.918
from working for
the No-Name League.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.441
I'm just saying,
think about it.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.575
Thomas, you must take Martha
with you to the negotiations.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.707
I'm in.
What are the negotiations?

00:55.751 --> 00:57.840
Are you willing to kill
to get out of here?

00:57.883 --> 01:00.321
AZIZ: The Ravens
and the No-Name League

01:00.364 --> 01:03.063
are negotiating
an electoral pact.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.108
Lord Harwood and the No-Name
patsies have to go.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.852
What's all this wailing, Mother?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.984
The police wanted him to do
a murder and he wouldn't,

01:12.028 --> 01:13.464
so he's going on the run.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.162
HARWOOD: The prime minister
tried to kill me.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.512
And now, the
crisis is here.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.992
If the queen is with you,
then we are.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.820
The queen is with me.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.388
It burns!

01:51.241 --> 01:52.547
Fuck.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.036
Hello? Hello?

02:05.647 --> 02:08.867
The queen... has been kidnapped.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.657
Hello?

02:15.700 --> 02:17.006
ALFRED: Hello, Mum.Alfie.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.139
Where are you?

02:19.182 --> 02:21.053
Listen, I can't say too much

02:21.097 --> 02:22.620
'cause your phone has
probably been tapped.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.579
What, somebody's listening?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.189
They should be ashamed
of themselves.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.800
Yeah, look. I've found a way out
of the country.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.281
So if you don't hear from me
for a while,

02:31.325 --> 02:32.761
don't worry about it.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.719
As soon as I can,
I'll let you know where I am.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.330
MR. PENNYWORTH:
Is that Alfie?

02:36.373 --> 02:39.159
Yes.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.248
Your father wants a word.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.597
He-He's found his way

02:42.640 --> 02:45.252
out of the country;
he's going.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.471
He said there's
somebody listening.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.651
Hello, son.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.045
ALFRED:
Dad.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.394
I won't ask any questions.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.180
Y-You must be in a hurry,
I expect.

03:01.833 --> 03:05.054
Not long now.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.230
Things are going to change,

03:07.274 --> 03:10.451
and you'll be safe to come home.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.541
So... we'll see you again soon.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.761
Yeah, you will.
No doubt.

03:16.805 --> 03:19.808
I-I'll put your mother back on.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.592
Best of luck, son.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.420
Bye, Dad.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.554
MRS. PENNYWORTH:
You be good, Alfie.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.686
Goodbye.Bye, Mum.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.819
Bye.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.492
POLICEMAN: Approaching
Lord Harwood's Manor.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.277
Lord Harwood is to be
apprehended alive.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.723
POLICEMAN:
Room's clear!

04:09.118 --> 04:10.337
The place is empty.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.912
PEGGY:
Now, listen,

04:20.956 --> 04:22.305
I'm gonna hold
the phone for you,

04:22.349 --> 04:24.699
and you're gonna read this here,

04:24.742 --> 04:26.309
just as it's written. Yeah?

04:26.353 --> 04:29.007
Now, you're to promise
you won't cause any mischief

04:29.051 --> 04:30.574
or scream or
owt like that.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.446
No point, any road.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.230
The neighbors
are used to screaming.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.711
You'll be good?

04:40.410 --> 04:41.933
I really don't think...

04:41.977 --> 04:43.283
Do you want to live?

04:47.069 --> 04:48.200
Then do as you're told.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.210
I...

04:58.254 --> 05:01.170
I am safe and healthy

05:01.213 --> 05:04.695
and among friends.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.872
I am speaking
under no compulsion.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.787
As queen

05:09.831 --> 05:11.876
and head of the armed forces,

05:11.920 --> 05:16.446
I command the immediate
resignation of the government.

05:16.490 --> 05:20.363
By force, if necessary.

05:20.407 --> 05:24.715
I appoint Lord Harwood

05:24.759 --> 05:26.978
as my new prime minister...

05:27.022 --> 05:29.067
...invested with full
sovereign power.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.940
He has my full trust

05:31.983 --> 05:34.334
and confidence.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.248
SOLDIER:
All right, ready? Step it up!

05:36.292 --> 05:39.034
Move it!
Left. Left, right, left.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.036
Give them a hand
with the sandbags!

05:41.079 --> 05:43.908
That's it, soldiers!

07:08.515 --> 07:11.082
The PM's on the line, my Lord.

07:14.129 --> 07:17.132
Prime Minister,

07:17.175 --> 07:20.614
are you there?

07:20.657 --> 07:22.267
Hello?

07:22.311 --> 07:23.573
We're thinking.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.489
Well, I thought
we'd been disconnected.

07:30.275 --> 07:33.583
We need more time
to consider the position.

07:35.672 --> 07:40.547
I have the queen,
I have the pretender.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.419
The army have tanks
en route to your door.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.943
There is nothing more
to consider.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.511
Resign.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.122
Resign now, or face
the consequences in blood.

07:54.038 --> 07:56.998
We will not be bullied, sir!

07:57.041 --> 07:59.740
Bullied, my old friend?
Bullied?

07:59.783 --> 08:01.959
I'll see you hung on a hook!

08:02.003 --> 08:05.267
Tempers are high.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.964
I'm sure you'll
agree, my Lord,

08:07.008 --> 08:09.227
there is no need
for that kind of talk.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.537
Absolutely right.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.278
No banter.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.454
Give him time
to see sense.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.151
Why?

08:20.195 --> 08:22.893
We must do our
utmost to avoid

08:22.937 --> 08:25.330
shedding English blood.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.116
Give him 24 hours.For God's sake.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.509
Our utmost.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.383
Prime Minister.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.736
We will shortly have full
control of the capital.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.346
You have 24 hours to resign

08:41.390 --> 08:43.131
to ensure a peaceful transition.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.960
If you don't,
we shall use violence.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.963
Personally, I'd prefer
you to be stubborn,

08:49.006 --> 08:50.747
but it's your call, old man.

08:59.234 --> 09:02.890
A high hand, sir.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.283
I hope you know what you're
doing, for all our sakes.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.546
So do I.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.638
Tell me.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.074
Where is the queen?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.728
Well, I shan't be
telling you that.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.295
As a strategic cove
yourself, you understand.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.343
Hmm.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.780
I understand well enough.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.216
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:25.260 --> 09:27.088
I'll see to the duke
and duchess's accommodation.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.698
Please.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401
MAN:
Get the general on the line.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.103
Light one of those
for me, will you?

09:45.106 --> 09:47.717
Try to get along
with him a little better.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.806
Did I vex him?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.329
A little.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.202
He'll get over it, I expect.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.030
And you, Frances?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.249
Don't play with me, Jimmy.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.469
We've abducted the queen.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.689
You know damn well
I didn't sign up for that.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.909
We're doing big
things, Frances.

10:05.953 --> 10:09.173
Big things are heavy.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.828
I can't do this
without you.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.438
Now...

10:13.482 --> 10:16.746
more than ever, I need you
to trust my judgment.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.313
Do you?

10:35.722 --> 10:37.201
The list.Yes, my Lord,

10:37.245 --> 10:38.638
the lists are ready.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.690
Would you like
a sandwich?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.780
No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.610
That one's
cheese and pickle,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.394
and that's fish paste.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.309
Really, I...
I couldn't possibly...

10:58.353 --> 11:01.835
We won't have it said that
you weren't fed properly.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.401
Eat.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.682
Mm.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.121
The bosun's
named Roberts.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.644
He'll be the man
that you deal with,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.385
but the captain
is in on it.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.169
Once the ship is
well out to sea,

11:32.213 --> 11:33.736
you can come
out of hiding.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.608
Two weeks, and you'll
be in New Orleans.

11:38.654 --> 11:42.005
DAVEBOY:
America.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.225
Fuck, man.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.273
We'll never see you
again, will we?

11:49.317 --> 11:51.362
Don't worry. I'll send you
a postcard once I'm settled.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.109
Yeah. You'll keep an eye
on Mum and Dad, right?

11:59.153 --> 12:01.024
BAZZA:
We got them.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.200
Hello, lads.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.420
ALFRED:
Hello, Officer.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.639
You're very cheery.Special alert.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.859
Docks, railways,
airports.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.731
All closed.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.211
All available men
called out.

12:14.255 --> 12:17.345
Overtime pay, untold.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.739
What's the occasion?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.566
Oh, no, they don't tell us.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.568
No, we just got
to stop any and all

12:23.612 --> 12:24.874
suspicious-looking characters

12:24.918 --> 12:27.485
and bring them in for
questioning. That's all.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.794
So where are you boys
off to, then?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.188
Back to our ship.Huh.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.016
Sailors, are you?

12:36.059 --> 12:37.234
ALFRED: Yeah.Anchors aweigh.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.501
You'll have
your union cards then.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.721
Sir, we're late.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.984
Our ship might leave without us. Nah.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.290
You're safe.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.727
No ships are allowed
to leave port.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.989
Union cards.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.645
Fuck's sake.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.778
Anchors aweigh?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.969
: It just
came out wrong.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.763
POLICEMAN:
You fucking hear me!

13:44.562 --> 13:46.347
Pack a bag.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.783
Get your passport and valuables.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.656
What? Why?
What's going on?

13:51.700 --> 13:55.095
Lord Harwood is staging a coup--
a successful one, looks like.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.531
He has the army with him,

13:56.574 --> 13:58.228
and yesterday he
abducted the queen.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.970
Oh, my God. For sure?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.624
Straight from the Pentagon's
phone intercepts.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.626
It's not public
knowledge yet,

14:04.669 --> 14:06.671
but all hell is
about to break loose.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.457
The Ravens will have
a death list.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.154
You and I are almost
certainly on it.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.764
A death list?

14:12.808 --> 14:16.203
Come on.Seriously.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.900
They could be
on their way here now.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.728
The CIA's arranged transport
out of the country.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
We'll go to
my hotel room

14:21.208 --> 14:23.906
and wait there.
It's safer.Out of the country? No.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.299
You prefer to be hung
from a lamppost?

14:25.342 --> 14:27.431
What about the League?
What about Undine Thwaite?

14:27.475 --> 14:28.868
She can take care
of herself.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.131
Or not. That's not
our problem anymore.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.612
Speak for yourself. I made
a commitment to the League,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.223
and I won't
abandon them now.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.356
I'll-I'll go to League HQ, and
I'll see what I can do to help.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.664
Don't be so stupid.
The League is doomed.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.405
Why sacrifice yourself
to a lost cause?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.755
You wouldn't understand.
You don't believe in anything.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.583
Very little.
What I do believe in is true.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.063
What you believe in isn't.

14:50.106 --> 14:53.022
You're gonna give me a lecture
on the real world now?

14:53.066 --> 14:54.806
Your precious Undine Thwaite
had her own husband

14:54.850 --> 14:57.940
killed in front of her so that
she could take his place.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.511
That's bullshit.No bull.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.513
She is exactly
as wrong as Harwood

15:05.556 --> 15:07.515
or any other
would-be dictator.You're lying.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.517
Why the hell would I lie to you?

15:09.560 --> 15:12.172
The killing was sanctioned
by the CIA.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.262
They thought that she
would be easier to control,

15:15.305 --> 15:17.655
and the gunman was our
old friend Alfred Pennyworth.

15:25.881 --> 15:28.057
Even if that's true,

15:28.101 --> 15:30.930
she's just one person.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.888
That doesn't make
the whole movement wrong.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.981
No. No, it doesn't. True.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.417
Can we go now?

15:42.898 --> 15:47.076
Look, I... I'm sorry.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.905
I didn't want to tell you.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.821
Knowing a secret like that
can be dangerous.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.217
Is there a back way out of here?No.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.306
Then go hide. What?You go hide.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.916
Martha.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.967
Alfred.Martha Kane.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.577
Daveboy and Bazza.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.013
Hi.Hello, hi.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.320
I'm sorry to burst in on you
like this, but...

16:13.363 --> 16:15.975
Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.499
We're all
friends here.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.936
Thomas. I was just about
to ask Miss Kane

16:20.980 --> 16:22.372
if she knew
where you were.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.939
Why?
Anyone else here?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.029
No.We'll look around anyway.
No offense.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.552
Go ahead.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.424
I'm trying to get out
of the country,

16:30.467 --> 16:33.427
but it seems like every copper
in London's out looking for me.

16:33.470 --> 16:36.082
So I thought, who do I know
who knows people with airplanes

16:36.125 --> 16:37.300
who owes me a favor?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.955
Okay. Two things.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.653
One, the police
aren't looking for you.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.264
Harwood is staging a coup.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.570
He's got the army on his side
and he's abducted the queen.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.050
Hence all the
police activity.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.965
And two, since when
do I owe you a favor?

16:50.009 --> 16:51.706
The queen, abducted?

16:51.749 --> 16:53.273
THOMAS: Yeah, a short young
woman with a Manchester accent

16:53.316 --> 16:55.840
attacked two ghillies and took
her while she was out hunting.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.278
Now Lord Harwood's the only one
who knows where she is.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
A short woman
with a Manchester accent.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.803
Bet Sykes.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.501
Bet Sykes is dead.ALFRED: Yeah.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.242
No. Long story.

17:06.286 --> 17:09.289
The meeting with Harwood.
Remember the woman with him?

17:09.332 --> 17:11.900
He called her Sykes.Yes, I believe he did.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.642
Interesting, 'cause that
wasn't Bet Sykes.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.297
Well, how would you know?
You weren't even th...

17:17.340 --> 17:21.823
Oh. Ah.

17:21.866 --> 17:25.348
You were there.
You were the bad sniper.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.657
You missed deliberately?Alfie can shoot down flies.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.920
You missed because it was us?

17:31.963 --> 17:33.530
ALFRED:
I was tempted.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.837
Would've solved
a lot of problems,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.360
but it didn't seem
like fair play.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.060
Thank you.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.931
And you guys, too,
I guess.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.455
Not at all.
I was for shooting you.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.109
Nothing personal.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
DAVEBOY:
Me, too, and that's

17:49.155 --> 17:50.765
a lot of peer pressure
on your man.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.072
You two should be grateful.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.595
I am. Thank you.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.249
Much appreciated,
and fuck you guys.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.730
I was thinking
that you could pay me back

17:59.774 --> 18:01.384
with a seat on a plane
to America.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.734
You got it. There's a plane
leaving this morning.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.041
But now I'm having
second thoughts.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.608
Don't do that. Why?

18:07.651 --> 18:10.524
The queen's been hidden
somewhere clever,

18:10.567 --> 18:12.134
and we've stumbled across
two different women

18:12.178 --> 18:14.528
from Manchester
named Sykes.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.922
Now, if we were looking to find
the queen, I'd call that a lead.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.665
You're right.BAZZA:
Sherlock and Watson now.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.103
We're not looking
to find the queen.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.321
It's none
of our business.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.801
Nor ours. We're getting
on that plane.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.716
No, hold on. If there's even

18:28.759 --> 18:30.587
the slightest chance
that we can rescue the queen

18:30.631 --> 18:33.329
and stop Harwood, then surely
we have a moral duty to try.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.070
That is debatable.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.769
We're fighting against fascism,
against naked evil.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.163
And we lost this round.
We have to leave.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.644
I have been ordered to leave.I haven't.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.254
You see what
you've done here?

18:45.298 --> 18:48.605
You can go.
I'm not stopping you.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.130
BAZZA:
Alfie,

18:51.173 --> 18:52.870
America. Safety.

18:52.914 --> 18:56.744
If we rescue the queen,
I'm sorted, aren't I?

18:56.787 --> 19:00.051
Wouldn't need to run.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.184
Never mind Newgate,
knighthoods all round.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.580
I could stay
with Mum and Dad.And if we fail?

19:06.623 --> 19:08.582
Fail?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.932
Gercha.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.071
Morning, Mrs. P.Morning, Joe.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.725
Just one bottle today.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.162
Just one.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.384
MR. PENNYWORTH: He's done it,
Mother! He's done it!

19:28.428 --> 19:30.560
Who's done it?

19:30.604 --> 19:32.997
Who's done what?Lord Harwood has struck!

19:33.041 --> 19:37.480
The Raven Society's
overthrown the government.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.090

You said Ravens was just

21:01.303 --> 21:03.174
You never said anything
about revolutions.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.699
We've won, Mother,
we've won.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.222
Where are you going?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
I'll have to report
for duty at my chapter.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.009
You can't go out. You're poorly.

21:12.053 --> 21:15.143
I've never felt better
in my life.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.938
It's good to see you
again, Alfred.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.594
Likewise.How are you?

21:31.638 --> 21:34.162
Good. You?No, I mean really,

21:34.205 --> 21:36.599
how are you?
In yourself.

21:38.427 --> 21:41.648
In myself? Haven't
checked recently.

21:41.691 --> 21:45.652
Well, you should. The violence
you live with needs processing,

21:45.695 --> 21:47.828
I would think.
Don't you?

21:47.871 --> 21:51.353
Are all American
women like this?

21:51.397 --> 21:52.528
That must be exhausting.

21:52.572 --> 21:55.183
No, Martha is a special case.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.228
I'm just saying that repression
is unhealthy.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.143
I couldn't disagree more.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.342
Thank God we lived
to see this moment.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.347
The future's bright,

22:28.390 --> 22:33.308
but we here must remember
we're the Old Guard.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.355
The future doesn't belong to us.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.662
Our day's near done.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.447
If called upon,

22:41.490 --> 22:45.929
our duty is to defend this
victory with our last breath!

22:50.847 --> 22:52.936
No surrender!

22:52.980 --> 22:54.982
ALL:
No surrender!

23:06.559 --> 23:09.779
Awfully decent of you
to stay, old boy.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.434
Above and beyond
and all that.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.957
You flatter me, sir.

23:14.001 --> 23:16.656
If I had some craven way
to get out, I would take it.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.310
As it is, if I must go,

23:19.354 --> 23:20.964
I'm glad to go out
in honorable company.

23:21.008 --> 23:24.403
In such dramatic fashion, eh?

23:39.505 --> 23:40.854
Tell me something.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.639
Did you kill
Julian Thwaite?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.424
Why do you ask?

23:45.467 --> 23:48.209
I guess that means yes.
Did Undine Thwaite know?

23:48.252 --> 23:50.124
Was she part of it?

23:50.167 --> 23:53.432
I didn't ask her.Thomas says she knew.

23:53.475 --> 23:57.087
What does it matter now?I'd like to know
the truth.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.698
I told you the truth.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.177
Forgive me if I don't
always believe what yousay.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.875
I told you the truth because
I want to help you

24:01.918 --> 24:03.790
make good choices.
Forgive me.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.140
Why do you want to help me?
How does that help your agenda?

24:06.183 --> 24:07.837
Agenda? Oh, for God's sake.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.360
Helping you doesn't
help me at all.

24:09.404 --> 24:10.623
I like you, okay?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.451
I like you and I want to
be a friend to you.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.410
God knows why.So, you want to discredit
the cause that I believe in

24:15.454 --> 24:17.673
because you like me?No. Yes. Yes.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.110
That's exactly correct.
I give up.

24:29.163 --> 24:32.558
Oh...

24:32.601 --> 24:35.256
You...

24:35.299 --> 24:36.736
you-you mean, you likeme.

24:36.779 --> 24:40.740
Forget I ever spoke, okay?Wow.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.569
That hadn't occurred to me.

24:43.612 --> 24:44.918
Like, sexually?

24:44.961 --> 24:47.268
Uh, I'm sorry, Alfred.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.443
Pretend I'm not here.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.577
Nearly there.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.404
Thank God.

25:11.248 --> 25:14.425
Have you got Mrs. Block,
the Barber's Wife?

25:19.474 --> 25:20.780
Fuckery.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.136
Go on.That's all right.

25:29.179 --> 25:32.182
You've another turn,
until you get one wrong.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.663
Go on.

25:38.798 --> 25:42.105
And...

25:42.149 --> 25:44.455
and Master Bun,
the Baker's Son.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.676
You're too bloody good at
this game, too good by half.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.811
Give over, Bet.
It's just a game.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.643
She's looking at my cards.She's been kidnapped.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.994
She's had a knife at her throat,
her throne's in balance,

26:01.037 --> 26:02.735
and yet she's so desperate
to win at Happy Families,

26:02.778 --> 26:04.345
she's looking at your
bloody cards, is she?

26:08.654 --> 26:09.742
Are you?

26:11.570 --> 26:14.007
No.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.011
Go on.

26:24.321 --> 26:25.714
Hello?

26:25.758 --> 26:29.718
Hi. Is Mistress Sykes at home?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.938
Who's asking?

26:34.288 --> 26:36.290
Hi, uh, we saw her
advertisement,

26:36.333 --> 26:38.161
and we thought that maybe
she could help us with...

26:43.602 --> 26:44.820
What are you doing here?

26:44.864 --> 26:46.605
What do you think?

26:47.910 --> 26:48.998
Hello, everyone.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.742
Your Majesty.
Remember me?

26:53.786 --> 26:55.526
Yes.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.094
Hello again, Bet.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.835
Do us a favor,
put the knife down.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.663
I'll stab her.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.447
ALFRED:
Leave off.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.754
Why would you do that?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.451
You must be Margaret Sykes.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.323
Peg. How do.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.847
Tell your sister to put
the knife down.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.980
Oh, you think she'll do
as I tell her, will she?
Heck as like.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.373
How'd you find us?

27:16.417 --> 27:17.853
You're in the phone book.

27:17.897 --> 27:21.030
BAZZA: Clear!DAVEBOY: Clear!

27:21.074 --> 27:22.989
Bet, put the knife down.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.555
Please?

27:24.599 --> 27:26.732
I'll stab her, I will.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.256
: Nothing
against you, pet.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.997
I won't be thwarted.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.782
He's got a gun
pointed at you.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.697
So does he.
That's you, thwarted.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.570
Come on, love, please.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.182
Have I to see
my own sister shot dead

27:42.225 --> 27:43.531
out of sheer
bloody mindedness?

27:43.574 --> 27:45.402
Have I to see that?

27:45.446 --> 27:46.882
After all that I've done
for you?

27:55.848 --> 27:57.806
Thank you.

27:59.808 --> 28:02.071
I didn't give up.

28:02.115 --> 28:05.031
She made me.

28:09.644 --> 28:10.645
There's no one else here.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.214
It's too easy. Huh?

28:26.269 --> 28:27.575
Would you look at that, eh?

28:29.316 --> 28:31.927
He goes. Him. And her.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.016
And these chaps.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.151
Sir.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.544
General Malcolm speaking.QUEEN: General?

28:43.373 --> 28:46.202
Listen to me very closely.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.816
Yes, ma'am.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.819
Immediately.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.690
Given a choice...

28:55.734 --> 28:57.387
You won't be
needing that.

28:59.563 --> 29:00.869
I'm sorry?

29:00.913 --> 29:02.175
That was the queen.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.354
Oh?I have new orders.

29:07.397 --> 29:10.487
I try not to take undue pleasure
in doing my duty.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.751
But in this case...

29:12.794 --> 29:15.362
I'm going to indulge myself.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.253
Take him away.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.736
And her.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.219
Come on.
This way.

29:52.051 --> 29:55.532
Keep on moving!
Move it along there!

30:31.046 --> 30:33.135
My dear people,

30:33.179 --> 30:36.704
I'm so very happy
to speak to you today.

30:36.747 --> 30:42.014
Happy to assure you I'm safe
and among friends.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.108
When death seems close,

30:49.151 --> 30:52.328
certain truths about oneself
become all too clear.

30:52.372 --> 30:56.811
In truth, I've not always been
the best of rulers.

30:58.769 --> 31:02.469
In truth, sometimes I've been
blind to the suffering

31:02.512 --> 31:04.601
of my people.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.866
That will change, I promise you.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.563
We are all one nation,

31:09.606 --> 31:12.566
one island.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.003
Let us move forward together

31:15.047 --> 31:19.703
in a spirit of unity
and forgiveness.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.881
God bless all of us.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.885
Off air.

31:39.898 --> 31:40.986
How was I?

31:41.029 --> 31:42.422
Bloody good, ma'am.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.859
I do wish you wouldn't
call me "ma'am."

31:44.903 --> 31:47.035
It sounds like you're
speaking to my mother.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.645
What would you like me
to call you, then?

32:06.881 --> 32:08.361
Sorry, Mr. P.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.453
Least said,
soonest mended, love.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.777
Right, lads.
The usual?

32:33.821 --> 32:35.649
Aye.
Funny old week.

32:35.692 --> 32:39.174
Fucking coup?
Bloody liberty, I call it.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.220
The queen said it right,
didn't she?

32:41.263 --> 32:42.743
We're all one island.

32:42.786 --> 32:45.702
If you don't like it,
get in the fucking queue.

32:45.746 --> 32:46.790
Cheers, lads.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.271
Cheers.Cheers.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.969
So, how's yourselves?
Busy week?

32:54.494 --> 32:55.495
Not too bad.

32:55.538 --> 32:57.018
All right?

32:57.062 --> 32:58.498
All right.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.021
Where's Alfie?

33:02.023 --> 33:03.111
I-I don't know.

33:14.557 --> 33:18.387
We must never tell anyone
about this. Never.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.823
Not a soul.

33:22.696 --> 33:25.264
Who'd believe me?

33:25.307 --> 33:27.744
Um, I should, um...
I should be going.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.746
Can't you stay for breakfast?

33:29.790 --> 33:32.271
It's... it's almost midday.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.013
Thursday.Lunch, then.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.754
I would. I'd-I'd like to stay,

33:37.798 --> 33:40.627
but, um, I should, uh,
see me mum and dad.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.238
They'll be worried about me.

33:43.282 --> 33:46.067
Yeah. Of course.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.068
That's fine.

34:17.577 --> 34:20.406
Mum? Dad?

34:24.975 --> 34:28.153
You're supposed
to be gone!Well, I changed my mind.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.980
Didn't fancy abroad.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.374
Be serious. What about
the law after you?

34:32.418 --> 34:33.723
Well, they changed
their mind, too.

34:33.767 --> 34:36.117
A royal pardon.
Cast iron.
How?

34:36.161 --> 34:38.424
Why?ALFRED: Well, wheels
within wheels.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.904
All's well that ends well,
eh, Mum?

34:46.910 --> 34:48.651
Cheers.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.006
You had
something to do with the defeat

34:56.050 --> 34:58.922
of Harwood's rebellion,
I suppose.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.707
Uh, hence the pardon.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.188
Something like that.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.146
Yeah.

35:05.190 --> 35:08.541
Well, good. Good.

35:08.584 --> 35:11.500
I imagine you'll be
well ensconced now

35:11.544 --> 35:12.719
with the powers that be.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.200
Yeah, I am.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.593
They've offered me
a job. A good one.

35:17.637 --> 35:18.986
Working for Scotland Yard.

35:21.597 --> 35:22.685
You gonna take it?

35:22.729 --> 35:26.211
Well, I have to think.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.474
It felt good, though, Dad.

35:28.517 --> 35:31.999
It felt like I did something
useful, you know.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.262
Long time since
I've felt that.

35:34.306 --> 35:39.224
Hmm. Well, I'm very proud
of you, son. Very proud.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.139
I'm glad you're pleased.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.014
I would've thought you
had quite liked the look

35:47.057 --> 35:48.363
of Harwood and the Ravens.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.757
Order and strength
and all that.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.803
Hmm, and all that. Well,
I dare say there's nothing wrong

35:53.847 --> 35:57.677
with order and strength,
but what do I know?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.158
Hmm.

36:03.552 --> 36:06.251
While your mother's
not watching...

36:06.294 --> 36:08.253
Here.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.269
She told me, you know.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.795
She had to.

36:28.838 --> 36:29.970
Told you what?

36:32.102 --> 36:33.016
Cancer.

36:35.497 --> 36:39.458
Oh. Right.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.287
Well, I'm...

36:42.330 --> 36:45.377
I'm sorry she did that, son.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.989
To be expected, I suppose.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.253
Women.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.258
I...

36:57.302 --> 37:00.087
I didn't want any fuss.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.351
No, I understand.

37:03.395 --> 37:05.135
Don't be angry with her.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.529
Oh, I'm not. I won't.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.139
I've no anger left in me.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.794
I'm just glad I know.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.623
You know, so I can be here.

37:17.583 --> 37:20.716
I haven't got very long, son.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.936
I need you to
promise me something.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.459
You never know.

37:24.503 --> 37:27.070
You have to promise me that
you'll always think well of me

37:27.114 --> 37:29.116
when I'm gone.

37:31.814 --> 37:32.859
Whatever people might say.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.339
What might people say?

37:34.382 --> 37:37.951
You promise me?Yeah, I promise.

37:41.563 --> 37:45.263
You told him about my cancer,
you wretched woman!

37:49.484 --> 37:51.181
I'm only joking.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.271
You silly sausage.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.925
Come here.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.318
I don't mind, really.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.102
Hey...

37:59.146 --> 38:00.843
maybe he'll show a little
bit more respect now.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.759
Eh?

38:07.197 --> 38:09.591
HARWOOD:
I'm truly sorry, ladies.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.202
I've got you into
a bit of a scrape, eh?

38:12.246 --> 38:13.726
PEGGY: It don't
look good, does it?

38:13.769 --> 38:16.859
We don't blame you, mind.
You did your best.

38:16.903 --> 38:20.950
Don't despair.
All is not yet lost.

38:20.994 --> 38:23.997
A great leader prepares
for every possibility.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.607
Even failure.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.654
We still have one last
battalion in reserve.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.960
What do you mean, Jimmy?
What have you done?

38:31.004 --> 38:35.182
The Old Guard die,
they do not surrender.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.673
Goodbye, you lot.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.370
Will you be late?

38:49.414 --> 38:52.025
Don't stay up.

38:52.068 --> 38:55.158
His nibs is throwing
a big celebration dinner.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.252
I love you.

39:03.993 --> 39:07.214
Oh. Thanks very much.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.346
I love you, too.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.177
MAN :
Frankenstein would been accepted
as a genius of science.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.093
Instead, he was sent
to the guillotine.Goodbye, son.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.660
Bye, Dad.

39:18.704 --> 39:21.968
MAN :
I swore I would have my revenge.

39:22.011 --> 39:25.363
They will never be rid of me.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.847
This is something I am proud of.

40:02.835 --> 40:03.836
Hi.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.883
Come in.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.668
I'm in.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.409
What are you doing?

40:13.933 --> 40:17.240
Paperwork.
Hmm.

40:17.284 --> 40:21.114
The CIA really sucks, huh?

40:21.157 --> 40:22.420
What do you want, Martha?

40:24.683 --> 40:27.250
I, um...

40:27.294 --> 40:31.254
I've been thinking about
what you said...

40:31.298 --> 40:32.299
in the black mariah.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.519
The black mariah?

40:34.562 --> 40:36.390
Mm-hmm.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.306
Oh, that.
Uh, have you?

40:39.349 --> 40:42.091
I've forgotten.
It's a blur.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.315
You said, um...

40:48.358 --> 40:50.099
Well, actually,
you said a lot of things,

40:50.143 --> 40:52.058
but, um...

40:54.190 --> 40:56.628
...you said that you like me.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.763
Sexually.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.901
I-I said nothing
of the kind.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.903
You... you...

41:10.946 --> 41:13.122
inferred that.Was I wrong?

41:16.169 --> 41:19.302
Well, I like all
sorts of women...

41:19.346 --> 41:21.130
sexually.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.958
You're not a special case.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.351
Why do you ask?

41:24.394 --> 41:26.484
That was a no, wasn't it?

41:26.527 --> 41:28.007
I wasn't wrong?

41:30.618 --> 41:32.359
Well, not in principle.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.579
No.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.711
Where is this going?
Okay.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.408
Good.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.064
Well, I thought about
what you said,

41:42.108 --> 41:43.501
and, um...

41:48.462 --> 41:49.985
...I surprised myself.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.989
I find that I like you, too.

41:57.776 --> 41:59.255
So here I am.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.131
Here you are.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.407
MAN :
You're quite safe now.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.675
Hello?

42:27.719 --> 42:29.721
Yes.

42:29.764 --> 42:32.288
May I ask who's...

42:32.332 --> 42:33.638
Oh.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.596
Alfie, it's for you.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.989
Who is it?

42:37.032 --> 42:40.470
A lady. Prefers not
to say who she is.

42:40.514 --> 42:41.733
ALFRED:
Ah.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.216
Hello?

42:47.260 --> 42:50.306
Alfie, it's me.

42:50.350 --> 42:52.439
Oh, hello.
Um, anything wrong?

42:52.482 --> 42:56.225
No, no, just... bored.

42:56.269 --> 42:57.923
I'm at a horrible dinner party.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.620
I wish you were here.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.579
Well, best I'm not, probably.

43:01.622 --> 43:04.190
It's at the
Sir Francis Duke's house.

43:04.233 --> 43:07.759
The PM, the chancellor,
and 20 other ancient creatures

43:07.802 --> 43:09.935
celebrating their victory.

43:09.978 --> 43:11.589
Tedium beyond words.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.591
Oh, yeah. I can imagine.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.985
So, uh...

43:17.029 --> 43:18.247
Thank you for a lovely time.

43:18.291 --> 43:20.380
It was scrumptious.

43:20.423 --> 43:22.774
Uh, yeah, it was. Yeah.

43:22.817 --> 43:25.820
Thank you, too, also.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.256
We shall meet again, I hope.

43:27.300 --> 43:30.738
Yeah, I hope so, too.

43:30.782 --> 43:34.524
I'm rather hard to get hold of.
I'll call you, shall I?

43:36.091 --> 43:38.441
Yeah.

43:38.485 --> 43:39.747
Bye, Alfie.

43:39.791 --> 43:41.488
Bye, Your M...

44:28.970 --> 44:30.972
MAN: I'm not tall enough
to get it meself.

44:50.513 --> 44:52.037
Hello.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.355
What's the matter?

45:08.444 --> 45:09.968
Don't know.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.754
I've got a bad
feeling as well.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.714
Maybe it's the film.

45:18.585 --> 45:19.717
Yeah.

45:31.206 --> 45:32.468
It's still there.

45:32.512 --> 45:34.166
What is it?

45:36.951 --> 45:38.910
Dad was acting strange.

45:38.953 --> 45:41.695
He's not well.No, something else.

45:44.959 --> 45:45.917
What?

45:47.135 --> 45:48.310
You made a face.

45:48.354 --> 45:50.530
It's my face, I can do
what I like with it.

45:50.573 --> 45:51.792
Mum...

45:54.229 --> 45:57.537
He was upset about all that
Raven Society lark.

45:57.580 --> 45:58.712
Why?

45:58.756 --> 46:00.453
He-he just was.

46:00.496 --> 46:02.107
Why? He's not one of them.

46:03.238 --> 46:06.111
Not so as you'd know.

46:06.154 --> 46:07.982
What do you mean?

46:08.026 --> 46:10.028
He wasone of them?

46:12.857 --> 46:15.076
Well, why didn't he tell me?
Why didn't youtell me?

46:15.120 --> 46:16.904
Nobody's supposed to
know. Not even me.

46:16.948 --> 46:21.822
It was a secret hobby sort
of thing, like the Masons,

46:21.866 --> 46:23.868
and he was in the
most secret chapter.

46:23.911 --> 46:25.783
As if a man's wife
wouldn't find out.

46:25.826 --> 46:28.089
Silly buggers.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.830
It seemed harmless
at the time.

46:29.874 --> 46:32.615
Harmless? They tried
to take over the country.

46:32.659 --> 46:35.836
He just liked the camaraderie.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.317
Call themselves the Old Guard.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.754
Once a month, he'd come home
drunk, singing "Jerusalem."

47:11.567 --> 47:12.742
Where are you going?

47:12.786 --> 47:15.571
Nowhere. Out.

47:15.615 --> 47:18.444
Need some air.
Bit of a shock, that's all.

47:18.487 --> 47:19.706
Alfie?

47:28.193 --> 47:29.368
What?

47:29.411 --> 47:30.586
What?

47:30.630 --> 47:31.892
You're laughing.

47:31.936 --> 47:35.156
: I'm...Hmm?

47:35.200 --> 47:37.593
Well, it's funny,

47:37.637 --> 47:39.465
you and I... making out.

47:39.508 --> 47:41.859
Okay.

47:43.034 --> 47:44.513
True.

47:44.557 --> 47:46.907
You're not gonna be giggling
the whole time, are you?

47:46.951 --> 47:49.301
I'll restrain myself.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.869
Good.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.871
Comedic sex
is all very well...

47:53.914 --> 47:56.438
Thomas!

48:01.139 --> 48:02.923
Shit. Thomas!

48:13.847 --> 48:16.545
MARTHA:
Thomas. Thomas,

48:16.589 --> 48:17.503
stay with me.

48:22.508 --> 48:24.553
Stay with me, Thomas.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.276
CHEF:
Keep it moving.

49:44.372 --> 49:46.026
Excuse me.

49:46.070 --> 49:47.636
You can't go down there.

49:51.510 --> 49:53.294
Should you be here, sir?

49:58.734 --> 50:00.519
Mrs. Draper!

50:00.562 --> 50:02.042
Alfie!

50:02.086 --> 50:03.435
Ah...I thought that was you.

50:05.089 --> 50:06.481
Ah... gorgeous
as ever.

50:06.525 --> 50:09.441
Get out.
How are you?

50:09.484 --> 50:12.096
Got to have a quick word with
the old man. Mum's took poorly.

50:12.139 --> 50:14.098
Oh. Come along, then.

50:14.141 --> 50:16.361
Nothing serious, I hope.Me, too.

50:16.404 --> 50:18.493
He's all right, sir.
He's family.

50:18.537 --> 50:19.668
All right.

50:39.819 --> 50:41.777
Marvelous.

51:00.100 --> 51:01.406
MAN:
Hey! Where you...

51:09.022 --> 51:09.979
Dad?

51:12.460 --> 51:14.071
Alfie, what are
you doing here?

51:15.637 --> 51:17.639
I...

51:17.683 --> 51:20.773
I need to have
a word with you. Now.

51:20.816 --> 51:23.210
Go away, son.

51:23.254 --> 51:24.385
I'm on duty.

51:32.437 --> 51:33.699
You do what I say, boy.

51:33.742 --> 51:36.223
What the hell is going on?

51:38.399 --> 51:39.748
Shut it!

51:44.579 --> 51:46.059
Nobody move or speak.

51:50.890 --> 51:51.978
Thank you.

51:53.588 --> 51:55.024
Dad...

51:55.068 --> 51:57.157
Except you, son.

51:57.201 --> 51:58.550
You have to go now.

52:01.857 --> 52:03.729
You need to be looking after
your mother.

52:06.253 --> 52:08.342
That's your job.
Think about her.

52:08.386 --> 52:10.344
No, no, no.
She'll understand in the end.

52:10.388 --> 52:13.478
I don't give a fuck
about the end.

52:13.521 --> 52:15.871
I care about now.
Don't do this.

52:17.003 --> 52:18.961
I'm sorry, son.

52:20.311 --> 52:21.486
I love you.

52:27.535 --> 52:29.058
