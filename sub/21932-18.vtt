00:49.982 --> 00:51.824
Folks like that like to come in here

00:51.847 --> 00:53.668
and lord it over the likes of us.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.076
Full suit and tie.

00:57.292 --> 00:59.342
Go drink somewhere else!

00:59.969 --> 01:01.760
No trouble from you two, now.

01:02.493 --> 01:03.782
Sorry, Detective.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.619
I've seen him.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.136
Supposed to be the brightest
fellow in all Toronto.

01:11.483 --> 01:12.851
He look bright to you?

01:12.892 --> 01:14.039
Nope.

01:14.559 --> 01:16.356
Not so bright at all.

01:20.796 --> 01:23.491
- Hey! Go easy on him!
- Nice work.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.904
You may wanna go home now fellas.

01:27.889 --> 01:29.852
Barkeep, I'll have another.

01:29.871 --> 01:31.993
- Why don't you throw him out?
- It's a celebration.

01:32.011 --> 01:34.169
- He's the one that started it.
- I got a promotion.

01:34.942 --> 01:37.576
Time was I couldn't hold down a job,

01:37.594 --> 01:40.722
let alone get a raise
and my name on the door.

01:42.458 --> 01:43.569
Just goes to show you,

01:43.587 --> 01:46.299
a man can change his life
if he sets his mind to it.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.008
Don't you agree?

01:48.252 --> 01:49.684
If you say so.

01:50.357 --> 01:52.351
Many a time in my past I'd be...

01:52.379 --> 01:54.654
sitting in a place like this

01:54.779 --> 01:57.215
wanting to down that drink to forget.

01:58.468 --> 02:00.610
What if you're just looking for privacy?

02:02.770 --> 02:05.243
For that you have to
drink at home, my friend.

02:06.487 --> 02:08.660
Of course, that's not always an option.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.364
You know when we split,

02:11.903 --> 02:15.499
I was dancing down the
street I was so damn happy.

02:15.540 --> 02:17.348
Me and the wife, I mean.

02:18.159 --> 02:19.605
Congratulations.

02:19.616 --> 02:21.188
It didn't last.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.871
The more I put my life back together,

02:23.882 --> 02:25.744
the more I realized what I'd lost.

02:26.433 --> 02:28.195
She was the first thing I thought of

02:28.230 --> 02:30.014
when they told me about my promotion.

02:30.139 --> 02:32.352
I just want to tell her the good news.

02:32.477 --> 02:35.887
- So go tell her.
- I would if I could find her.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.040
I've been searching for her a year.

02:38.702 --> 02:41.834
- A year?
- She didn't exactly keep me apprised

02:41.851 --> 02:44.954
of her forwarding address
after I walked out on her.

02:44.989 --> 02:47.344
I'm sure she was glad to see me go.

02:51.864 --> 02:54.426
I couldn't stand to look
her in the eye anymore.

02:55.474 --> 02:59.034
By the time I realized what
I'd lost, she'd moved on.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.013
I'd give just about
anything for a second chance.

03:09.739 --> 03:11.500
Maybe I can help you.

03:12.024 --> 03:13.486
What do you mean?

03:16.088 --> 03:18.040
Let's go find your wife.

03:18.437 --> 03:21.079
- Really?
- I won't offer twice.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.428
It's something I'm very good at.

04:05.151 --> 04:06.734
You can't blame him.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.749
I wouldn't be at work either.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.014
I can't imagine I'd
want to be home either.

04:12.054 --> 04:15.899
One hopes this won't put too much
of a strain on their relationship.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.202
How so?

04:18.327 --> 04:19.732
In the face of a great loss,

04:19.755 --> 04:23.284
emotions can be misdirected,
feelings amplified.

04:23.457 --> 04:26.190
I knew a young couple who
experienced a similar issue.

04:26.382 --> 04:28.159
They never recovered.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.469
William Murdoch and Julia Ogden

04:30.495 --> 04:32.495
are two of the strongest
people that I know.

04:33.526 --> 04:35.099
They'll be fine.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.583
Sir,

04:36.623 --> 04:39.956
we found a body at the docks
near the mouth of the Don.

04:40.305 --> 04:42.586
Or rather, a portion of a body.

04:42.661 --> 04:43.680
A portion?

04:44.820 --> 04:46.237
You take this.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.430
I don't even want to know.

04:59.501 --> 05:00.969
Ahem.

05:05.189 --> 05:07.964
The secret to dealing
with gruesome remains

05:07.999 --> 05:10.578
is to replace natural
instinct with logic.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.770
OK.

05:13.969 --> 05:15.443
How?

05:15.737 --> 05:17.130
Consider an ant.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.353
Imagine you trod upon one, crushing it

05:19.364 --> 05:21.879
and leaving its body
mangled beyond recognition.

05:21.913 --> 05:23.705
Now, does this disturb you?

05:23.915 --> 05:25.622
- Not really.
- Exactly,

05:25.645 --> 05:28.029
so we simply apply the transitive law.

05:28.058 --> 05:29.906
If we are not disturbed by an ant,

05:29.911 --> 05:32.185
there is no reason to
be disturbed by a beetle.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.707
If not by a beetle, then
not by a caterpillar,

05:34.748 --> 05:37.960
nor a butterfly, nor
a sparrow, nor a fish

05:37.994 --> 05:40.158
nor a rabbit, nor a dog,

05:40.283 --> 05:41.954
nor a human.

05:42.386 --> 05:43.768
What we have here, then,

05:43.797 --> 05:47.938
is no more disturbing than
the squashed remains of an ant.

05:48.156 --> 05:49.560
What's this?

05:49.825 --> 05:53.944
A reminder of the
inhumanity of man, Miss Hart.

05:54.126 --> 05:56.186
How poetic. May I have a look?

05:56.187 --> 05:57.770
It's quite grisly, ma'am.

05:57.804 --> 06:00.284
Perhaps it would be best
to wait for Dr. Ogden.

06:00.409 --> 06:02.145
I don't expect her today.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.455
Whatever it is, I assure
you I can handle it.

06:05.835 --> 06:07.324
Ahem.

06:11.073 --> 06:13.815
- His head is missing.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.573 --> 06:19.071
Incredibly sad about the
detective and his wife.

06:19.196 --> 06:20.701
Yes.

06:20.972 --> 06:23.340
But you know, it has me
thinking about the future.

06:23.746 --> 06:25.976
I've been thinking about that myself.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.174
I mean our future in particular.

06:28.243 --> 06:29.815
Yes, George.

06:30.374 --> 06:32.706
Wasn't Paris a magical city?

06:33.345 --> 06:35.417
Do you ever imagine us back there?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.743
Yes, I suppose.

06:37.801 --> 06:39.833
What if we were to live there?

06:40.921 --> 06:42.999
Nina, I don't know. I mean...

06:44.145 --> 06:45.797
I don't know the language.

06:45.832 --> 06:48.664
You picked up a little bit. I
know ้clair. That's about it.

06:49.815 --> 06:52.578
I've been offered a
job at the Moulin Rouge.

06:53.332 --> 06:55.625
- George, I'm going to accept it.
- What?

06:55.688 --> 06:58.250
And I want you to come with me. Nina!

06:59.015 --> 07:01.260
Let's make a new life, George.

07:02.066 --> 07:03.590
Once you pick up the language,

07:03.604 --> 07:05.716
perhaps you could become
a member of the Sรปret้.

07:05.734 --> 07:08.070
I'm sure with your experience,
they'd be happy to have you.

07:10.281 --> 07:11.956
I don't know what to say to this.

07:12.987 --> 07:15.204
I want this for us.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.236
For you, George.

07:17.674 --> 07:19.038
Please.

07:20.305 --> 07:23.512
Nearly all of her family are
either dead or have left town.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.880
- Did she have friends?
- I tracked down a few but nothing.

07:26.932 --> 07:30.501
I even checked her favourite
bookstores too. Annie loved to read.

07:30.536 --> 07:33.043
Anything with a good
mystery or a bit of romance.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.446
- And no one had seen her.
- No, not recently.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.254
That's why I think she
must have left town.

07:37.283 --> 07:40.847
Even her physician hadn't seen
her since... springtime I think.

07:40.852 --> 07:43.654
- Did she see him regularly?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

07:43.688 --> 07:46.257
She's epileptic, so she'd
see him for the bromide.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.344
She hadn't had a fit in years, but
an ounce of prevention, as they say.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.229
- Did she work outside the home?
- She did.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.499
Annie was a home nurse,
a real caring sort.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.736
Presumably you asked
after her at her workplace?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.714
It was private homes, mostly.

08:00.727 --> 08:02.915
I never took much notice
of where she was working

08:02.941 --> 08:04.509
and who she was nursing.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.399
I never took much
notice of a damn thing.

08:07.733 --> 08:09.880
Wasn't much of a husband, was I?

08:10.369 --> 08:13.460
- We all make mistakes.
- Yeah. Thanks.

08:13.909 --> 08:16.413
The last place she lived
is just down this way.

08:28.628 --> 08:31.823
- How are you feeling, Doctor?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.780
I was hoping to catch William.

08:33.905 --> 08:36.123
Oh. I've not seen him today.

08:36.347 --> 08:37.821
Oh.

08:38.121 --> 08:41.529
I just stepped out for a moment.
I thought he was coming here.

08:41.707 --> 08:45.000
- He's likely at home.
- You both need some time, I'm sure.

08:45.409 --> 08:48.737
Well, one can't sit around
feeling sorry for oneself.

08:49.927 --> 08:51.470
I'll find him.

08:52.743 --> 08:54.090
Thank you.

08:58.235 --> 09:01.914
It appears the head and each leg
was severed with the same blade.

09:01.925 --> 09:03.422
Are you certain?

09:03.659 --> 09:06.737
Yes. The arms though, those
were removed differently.

09:06.771 --> 09:09.306
Each arm took multiple
hacks to be severed.

09:10.636 --> 09:12.977
You seem to have steeled
your nerves, Constable.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.945
I'm using the transitive law, Miss Hart.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.880
This torso is just an ant.

09:16.915 --> 09:18.353
Well executed.

09:19.177 --> 09:20.884
The wounds look similar,

09:20.919 --> 09:22.963
how can you be sure
a different implement

09:22.986 --> 09:25.422
was used to take the fellow's arms?

09:25.506 --> 09:27.591
You mean because I'm not a doctor.

09:27.805 --> 09:29.426
Well, yes.

09:30.061 --> 09:31.771
Despite what you may think,

09:31.811 --> 09:33.944
I don't sit around
twiddling my thumbs all day.

09:34.017 --> 09:36.533
I've read every book
in Dr. Ogden's library.

09:36.658 --> 09:39.036
There are several chapters
on the removal of limbs,

09:39.070 --> 09:40.686
if you're interested to have a read.

09:41.096 --> 09:42.234
Hmm.

09:42.593 --> 09:46.486
What if we find her and
she doesn't want you back?

09:46.500 --> 09:47.847
Oh.

09:48.693 --> 09:50.790
I suppose I could tell her I'm sorry.

09:50.915 --> 09:52.893
End things on an up note, you know?

09:52.936 --> 09:55.061
Do you think there's
hope for reconciliation?

09:55.084 --> 09:56.535
I like to think so...

09:56.660 --> 09:59.263
but some things are
just too broken to fix.

09:59.908 --> 10:01.422
This is it here.

10:08.699 --> 10:11.168
As I said, she moved on months ago.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.658
Well, at least one person
wasn't aware of that.

10:14.894 --> 10:16.573
A Mr. Frank Gage.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.377
Yes.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.564
I think he was one of her clients.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.063
Mr. Gage?

10:24.565 --> 10:26.137
Mr. Gage...

10:26.891 --> 10:28.837
I'm Annie's husband.

10:29.009 --> 10:30.821
Do you remember Annie?

10:30.855 --> 10:32.833
Annie is a lovely girl.

10:32.902 --> 10:34.889
She used to cut my hair.

10:34.946 --> 10:37.461
Yes. Does she still come by,

10:37.495 --> 10:39.137
take care of you?

10:39.262 --> 10:41.698
The new girl is Miss Turner.

10:41.924 --> 10:45.571
Miss Turner doesn't
like me to have sweets.

10:47.631 --> 10:49.036
Mr. Gage,

10:49.161 --> 10:51.471
when did you last see Annie?

10:51.972 --> 10:53.777
No Annie.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.947
Miss Turner is the new girl.

10:58.138 --> 10:59.698
He's confused.

10:59.738 --> 11:03.087
At any rate, it seems clear that
she doesn't work here any longer,

11:03.121 --> 11:06.375
which would explain why he sent
the letter to an old address.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.947
Damn it.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.340
Mr. Gage?

11:12.530 --> 11:15.311
Miss Turner doesn't
like you to have sweets?

11:15.436 --> 11:18.068
No sir. Meat and potatoes.

11:18.103 --> 11:20.221
She gives me meat and potatoes.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.622
Meat and potatoes. Meat and potatoes.

11:22.662 --> 11:24.106
Then who gave you these?

11:24.129 --> 11:25.897
Oh... Ahem.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.567
Mr. Gage,

11:34.809 --> 11:37.287
did Miss Turner cut your hair this week?

11:37.322 --> 11:40.330
No, I told you. Annie does that.

11:40.387 --> 11:42.069
Annie cuts your hair?

11:42.247 --> 11:44.324
Did she cut your hair this week?

11:44.589 --> 11:46.150
Was she here?

11:47.762 --> 11:50.330
He said Annie cuts his
hair. Maybe she was here.

11:50.359 --> 11:51.752
I believe she was.

11:51.809 --> 11:53.595
Then she could come back.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.707
- We could just wait here for her.
- That won't be necessary.

11:56.832 --> 11:58.709
Thank you, Mr. Gage.

11:59.907 --> 12:01.739
Why? Where are we going?

12:01.912 --> 12:03.766
I believe I know where she is.

12:17.267 --> 12:18.813
Thank you.

12:23.137 --> 12:24.483
Ah, yes.

12:25.001 --> 12:26.261
Here we are.

12:27.028 --> 12:28.314
Where are we?

12:28.968 --> 12:32.227
This is where my wife likes
to buy Danish pastries.

12:32.254 --> 12:34.481
Like Annie did for Mr. Gage?

12:35.210 --> 12:37.257
Maybe she lives in the neighbourhood.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.194
But wait, you said...

12:39.215 --> 12:42.172
If Annie lived here, she would
still be working for Mr. Gage.

12:42.204 --> 12:45.971
But he has a new girl, suggesting
that Annie has moved out of town.

12:46.052 --> 12:47.857
Too far to still work for him,

12:47.982 --> 12:50.089
but not so far that she can't visit

12:50.105 --> 12:52.094
every few weeks for a haircut

12:52.310 --> 12:53.740
and a treat.

12:53.775 --> 12:55.985
Somewhere just outside of town.

12:56.661 --> 12:59.742
This coach goes to
Markham and back every day.

13:05.196 --> 13:07.720
Judging by the location
where the torso was found,

13:07.747 --> 13:10.098
we have to assume it
traveled down the Don River.

13:10.135 --> 13:12.075
I've identified the
locations here, here,

13:12.108 --> 13:15.405
here, and here, of
every industrial facility

13:15.426 --> 13:17.783
along the Don that
operates blades large enough

13:17.846 --> 13:20.247
to bisect a homo sapien.

13:22.450 --> 13:23.906
What?

13:24.376 --> 13:26.253
Chop a chap in half.

13:26.948 --> 13:29.710
Young Brackenreid, I want you to call on

13:29.724 --> 13:31.925
every one of these places

13:31.960 --> 13:34.194
to see if... well,

13:34.229 --> 13:37.363
to see if any of their employees
are murderers, I suppose.

13:37.488 --> 13:38.763
Yes, sir.

13:39.054 --> 13:41.800
I must say... this, fantastic!

13:41.836 --> 13:43.945
I really should get one of my own.

13:45.788 --> 13:48.404
Constable, it seems
something is troubling you?

13:48.772 --> 13:49.943
How so?

13:50.068 --> 13:52.813
There's an expression on
your face that suggests

13:52.847 --> 13:54.982
you have a thought in your head.

13:56.478 --> 13:58.770
Do you remember I asked
you about visiting Paris?

13:58.786 --> 13:59.992
No.

14:01.186 --> 14:03.710
And then I was away for some time?

14:04.775 --> 14:07.493
- No.
- No. Well, in any case, I did.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.529
I went to Paris with Nina.

14:09.829 --> 14:12.034
And she wants to go again, but...

14:12.769 --> 14:14.174
for good.

14:14.525 --> 14:17.404
So, you're considering
leaving us all behind?

14:17.438 --> 14:20.519
I don't want to. My
whole life is here. But...

14:21.929 --> 14:24.278
I could imagine a life there.

14:25.059 --> 14:26.656
I don't know. If I...

14:26.680 --> 14:29.388
if I don't go, I lose Nina.

14:29.691 --> 14:31.084
If I do,

14:32.004 --> 14:34.198
I lose everything
else that's dear to me.

14:35.246 --> 14:37.858
One loss doesn't outweigh the other?

14:39.554 --> 14:42.505
The enormity of either seems
too great to contemplate.

14:43.153 --> 14:44.674
Oof.

14:45.288 --> 14:46.455
Well...

14:47.763 --> 14:51.146
I... can't give you any advice.

14:51.995 --> 14:55.772
But I can tell you what I know.

14:57.107 --> 15:00.588
I know that we spend our whole
lives holding on to what we have.

15:00.761 --> 15:04.258
We fear loss as much as death itself.

15:04.383 --> 15:07.120
But without loss, there is no change.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.957
And without change, there is no...

15:11.366 --> 15:12.614
life.

15:14.996 --> 15:16.582
Detective...

15:17.301 --> 15:20.231
You realize there's nothing
written on the blackboard, right?

15:20.479 --> 15:24.468
Uh, yes, but it provides
a frame of reference.

15:25.197 --> 15:26.657
Ah.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.235
Markham, eh?

15:32.694 --> 15:34.258
What a dump.

15:34.669 --> 15:36.483
We'll be back at it at daybreak.

15:36.517 --> 15:37.917
No need for indulgences.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.073
Sorry. I didn't mean to complain.

15:40.695 --> 15:42.635
I sure am thankful, Detective.

15:42.924 --> 15:44.726
I've been searching for Annie for months

15:44.759 --> 15:46.927
and you've nearly found
her after only a day.

15:46.961 --> 15:48.962
Perhaps we've nearly found her.

15:49.136 --> 15:50.979
We mustn't get too excited.

15:51.332 --> 15:53.972
So, why are you doing all this for me?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.961
I suppose I can relate.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.101
How's that?

16:01.371 --> 16:03.375
Something with your wife, huh?

16:03.856 --> 16:06.180
Eh, I won't pry.

16:06.948 --> 16:09.049
But I know it must be trouble at home.

16:09.315 --> 16:12.352
A man like you is sure to be
married to a hell of a woman.

16:12.387 --> 16:14.174
Pardon my language.

16:14.812 --> 16:16.957
You're not such a bad
detective yourself.

16:17.655 --> 16:19.726
She is one hell of a woman.

16:20.092 --> 16:21.838
So what happened?

16:24.254 --> 16:26.497
I said some things,

16:26.767 --> 16:29.302
some terrible things
that are unforgivable,

16:29.993 --> 16:32.305
at the worst possible time.

16:33.381 --> 16:34.708
Will you go back?

16:35.938 --> 16:37.684
I don't know that I can.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.878
Some things are too broken to fix.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.337
You don't know that,

16:42.953 --> 16:44.715
not 'til you try.

16:47.353 --> 16:49.839
She did something that goes against...

16:49.964 --> 16:51.725
everything I believe.

16:52.709 --> 16:54.563
She knew how I would feel

16:54.574 --> 16:56.263
but did it anyway.

16:57.260 --> 17:00.151
In response, I was cruel.

17:03.171 --> 17:05.707
The truth is those things
have been between us

17:05.944 --> 17:07.840
since the very beginning.

17:08.409 --> 17:11.420
I suppose it just took
this long to push us apart.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.532
Well, in that case,

17:14.862 --> 17:17.851
maybe I'm not the only one
who could use a second act.

17:22.190 --> 17:25.192
Not a single factory reported
a suspicious employee.

17:25.226 --> 17:28.346
- And no evidence of a bloody incident?
- None, sir, I asked.

17:28.395 --> 17:32.087
Whoever did this worked carefully
to dispose of every part of the body,

17:32.100 --> 17:33.977
most of which we still haven't found.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.513
It makes sense they would have
cleaned the scene of the crime.

17:36.537 --> 17:39.239
What about other facilities
further away from the Don?

17:39.468 --> 17:40.964
But how far away?

17:40.994 --> 17:43.519
What we need is more
information about the victim.

17:44.138 --> 17:46.252
If only the coroner was available...

17:46.931 --> 17:48.397
I can do the post-mortem.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.395
I've seen Dr. Ogden
do it a million times.

17:50.425 --> 17:52.402
But you've never done it yourself?

17:53.772 --> 17:55.844
Did you solve your
first case, Detective?

17:55.922 --> 17:58.825
- Of course.
- Even though you'd never done it before?

17:59.333 --> 18:01.823
I suppose you have a point.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.231
I certainly do.

18:08.669 --> 18:10.046
Ooh!

18:15.497 --> 18:17.210
Annie lived next door to me.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.620
Lived?

18:19.018 --> 18:20.388
Where did she move to?

18:20.513 --> 18:21.971
She didn't move.

18:22.438 --> 18:23.514
She died.

18:23.726 --> 18:25.071
Oh, God.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.456
Are you quite sure?

18:28.504 --> 18:30.390
I heard that they found her in the bath.

18:30.424 --> 18:32.476
Some ailment had come over her...

18:32.974 --> 18:34.521
A seizure?

18:37.582 --> 18:38.836
I'm so sorry...

18:38.883 --> 18:40.003
I just attended the service

18:40.024 --> 18:42.061
over at Leonard's Funeral
Parlour this morning.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.231
The notice was in this morning's paper.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.396
Is he gonna be all right?

18:47.629 --> 18:49.202
He was her husband.

18:49.859 --> 18:51.165
And he didn't know?

18:52.925 --> 18:54.166
How awful.

18:55.847 --> 18:58.775
The man who rents the rooms
was clearing out her things.

18:58.852 --> 19:01.425
I believe they're still
inside if he'd care for them.

19:03.436 --> 19:04.891
And you spoke to him?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.407
Yes. He's fine.

19:06.991 --> 19:07.991
I see.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.883
So when is he coming back?

19:10.231 --> 19:12.165
- I don't know.
- He is coming back?

19:12.499 --> 19:13.896
I, uh...

19:16.239 --> 19:18.427
There is no need to lie
to me on his account.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.249
You didn't even speak to him, did you?

19:21.642 --> 19:24.392
No, but I know Murdoch, and
I know what he's thinking,

19:24.583 --> 19:26.780
and I know he'll be back
when he gets his head right.

19:26.814 --> 19:29.243
- We just have to be patient.
- Oh, is that so?

19:30.392 --> 19:32.888
Funny thing, I used to
think I knew him as well.

19:33.158 --> 19:35.082
When he returns, you'll see.

19:35.277 --> 19:36.526
That's just it.

19:36.651 --> 19:38.792
I'm no longer sure I
want him to come back.

19:39.876 --> 19:43.193
- I understand you being angry but...
- I had a life before William Murdoch.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.074
I can have one again.

19:58.317 --> 20:00.902
My desk, Miss Hart.
I'm not gone quite yet.

20:04.357 --> 20:05.507
What have you?

20:05.632 --> 20:07.495
Detective Watts had a pressing case.

20:07.521 --> 20:09.858
I suggested we wait for your return,

20:09.859 --> 20:11.322
but he urged me to proceed.

20:11.447 --> 20:12.943
Rightly so.

20:13.068 --> 20:15.554
- The victim remains unidentified?
- Yes.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.918
I'm examining the stomach contents
now to see if they can help us.

20:19.342 --> 20:21.460
All that we know so far
is that he was found in...

20:21.482 --> 20:23.700
Miss Hart, we have a puzzle for you.

20:23.735 --> 20:25.637
Oh, Doctor.

20:26.363 --> 20:27.855
Welcome back.

20:28.192 --> 20:30.808
We'll make this a
two-coroner puzzle then.

20:30.839 --> 20:32.361
Inspector?

20:34.237 --> 20:35.404
It's an arm.

20:35.915 --> 20:37.674
Washed up on the banks of the Humber.

20:38.646 --> 20:40.822
We need to know if it's a match.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.672
Let's take a look.

20:43.304 --> 20:45.250
It must be from the same person.

20:45.574 --> 20:47.191
How many stray arms could there be?

20:47.421 --> 20:49.781
I believe I may have
found our murder weapon.

20:49.906 --> 20:51.597
Oh, yes!

20:51.722 --> 20:53.261
- What do you think?
- Yes.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.360
It looks about right.

20:57.861 --> 20:59.170
William.

20:59.172 --> 21:01.230
- Dr. Ogden?
- Doctor?

21:01.403 --> 21:02.475
Hm?

21:02.709 --> 21:04.166
Do you concur?

21:05.048 --> 21:07.016
Yes. Of course.

21:07.716 --> 21:10.713
Miss Hart knows the details
of the case better than I do.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.203
Excuse me for just one moment.

21:16.593 --> 21:18.171
I want to see Annie.

21:18.201 --> 21:20.691
Annie Beckett. I'm her husband.

21:21.219 --> 21:24.232
Oh, I'm so sorry. The
service has concluded.

21:24.271 --> 21:27.661
We understand, but if we could
see the body, just for a moment?

21:27.873 --> 21:31.620
What I mean is there is
no body to see any longer.

21:32.066 --> 21:35.416
The cremation took place
directly following the service.

21:35.676 --> 21:37.776
Her minister told me that was her wish.

21:39.557 --> 21:40.928
I'm very sorry.

21:41.339 --> 21:43.753
It's our standard procedure
when there's no family

21:43.791 --> 21:45.524
to dictate proceedings.

21:46.177 --> 21:47.440
I see.

21:48.417 --> 21:49.866
Thank you for your time.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.564
Of course, I can offer you the remains.

21:53.048 --> 21:56.632
Though you may want to
purchase a receptacle.

21:59.079 --> 22:01.587
Because the torso was found
at the mouth of the Don,

22:01.596 --> 22:03.221
we assumed it traveled downriver.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.734
But with the arm being
found along the Humber...

22:05.764 --> 22:08.936
we must infer the disposal
site was actually in the west.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.772
Therefore, the torso
simply traveled further,

22:11.806 --> 22:13.508
all the way down to the lake,

22:13.525 --> 22:16.816
where its currents
moved it hither and yon,

22:16.820 --> 22:19.176
eventually delivering it here.

22:20.253 --> 22:22.510
What happened to the rest?

22:24.425 --> 22:26.977
I doubt they'll ever be found.

22:28.577 --> 22:29.718
Detective?

22:29.787 --> 22:32.209
- I have the post-mortem results.
- Tremendous.

22:32.213 --> 22:33.372
And?

22:33.441 --> 22:35.576
There was one item of note.

22:35.883 --> 22:38.036
Shortly before death, he'd taken a pill.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.372
Largely undigested.

22:39.381 --> 22:41.733
- Were you able to identify it?
- Yes.

22:41.768 --> 22:44.460
I used to formulate and
sell vital amines myself.

22:44.491 --> 22:47.115
They're composed of ferrous
and magnesium sulphates.

22:47.176 --> 22:49.061
A patent medicine.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.862
Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale People.

22:51.914 --> 22:53.708
Yes, those. You know them?

22:53.743 --> 22:54.841
I take them on occasion.

22:54.863 --> 22:56.562
They're good for building
strength and stamina.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.467
No they're not. But by all means, enjoy.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.394
I don't believe this pill
was from Dr. Williams.

23:02.437 --> 23:03.513
No?

23:03.557 --> 23:06.112
I'm very familiar with
patent medicines, Detective,

23:06.138 --> 23:09.596
and Dr. Williams' pills, as
ineffective as they may be,

23:09.631 --> 23:12.831
are unadulterated. This
one contained arsenic.

23:12.896 --> 23:15.087
- He was poisoned?
- Certainly not.

23:15.126 --> 23:16.268
It was a trace amount.

23:16.557 --> 23:19.009
Then you're not sure who made the pill?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.005
Arsenic is not uncommon
in and of itself.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.120
But when mixed with the
other two ingredients?

23:24.366 --> 23:27.381
There's only one product
that matches the composition.

23:27.415 --> 23:28.469
Do tell.

23:28.594 --> 23:29.809
It's one of Allman's.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.422
He's a Toronto pharmacist

23:31.448 --> 23:33.425
who makes and brands his own medicines.

23:33.464 --> 23:36.568
- And where would his pharmacy be located?
- Weston Road,

23:36.607 --> 23:37.774
just north of the Junction.

23:37.787 --> 23:41.164
Weston Road, just north of the Junction.

23:42.582 --> 23:44.147
Very near to the Humber.

23:50.214 --> 23:53.352
The coach for the city leaves at
quarter past seven in the morning.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.041
I'll wake you.

23:56.677 --> 23:58.701
I doubt I'll be sleeping much tonight.

23:59.457 --> 24:02.332
We may be parting ways
before getting on that coach.

24:02.354 --> 24:03.992
You're not going back to Toronto?

24:06.638 --> 24:08.800
These are all the things
from her rooming house.

24:08.878 --> 24:10.500
There's not even anything here.

24:11.248 --> 24:12.471
How do you mean?

24:13.194 --> 24:14.953
Nothing that means anything.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.942
Nothing that reminds me of her.

24:17.474 --> 24:19.420
It's just things anyone would have.

24:20.691 --> 24:24.037
- No books.
- No books, no jewelry...

24:24.716 --> 24:28.351
it's like everything that would have
meant something to her is missing.

24:33.371 --> 24:34.992
I've given it some thought.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.446
And I've decided to take some
time away from the morgue.

24:37.473 --> 24:38.721
Good.

24:38.846 --> 24:40.656
I don't know for how long.

24:40.781 --> 24:42.267
Take as long as you need.

24:42.588 --> 24:43.967
I'll have a word with
the Chief Constable.

24:43.975 --> 24:45.666
We'll find someone to fill in for you,

24:45.683 --> 24:47.643
and you'll be welcomed
back whenever you're ready.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.566
I don't know if I will be.

24:54.103 --> 24:55.387
I went there today,

24:55.711 --> 24:58.033
trying to return to my normal life.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.038
And when I looked up,
instead of William,

25:01.103 --> 25:03.575
there were three strangers
looking back at me,

25:03.895 --> 25:06.264
all of them engrossed
in some gruesome puzzle.

25:07.207 --> 25:08.508
He'll be back.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.083
It's not about William.

25:13.402 --> 25:16.212
For more than 10 years,
I've been mired in death.

25:16.407 --> 25:17.635
Why? For what?

25:18.219 --> 25:19.525
To help people.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.646
To put the guilty away
and set the innocent free.

25:23.632 --> 25:25.461
Of course. I'm not saying that

25:25.513 --> 25:27.376
what I did was without merit.

25:28.799 --> 25:31.435
I'm just saying I don't
think I want to do it anymore.

25:34.996 --> 25:36.871
It's not a factory exactly,

25:36.881 --> 25:38.514
but there is somewhere we should look.

25:38.541 --> 25:41.643
- And where's that?
- It's an abattoir.

25:41.718 --> 25:43.816
Interesting. Everyone accounted for?

25:43.843 --> 25:46.317
No employees suddenly fleeing town?

25:46.487 --> 25:49.241
The shift manager went round
and accounted for every man

25:49.263 --> 25:50.652
on the floor while I was
on the phone with him,

25:50.669 --> 25:53.749
but that was only the day
shift. There is a night shift...

25:54.014 --> 25:55.603
with only two workers.

25:55.614 --> 25:58.484
Not just interesting, very interesting.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.526
- You're a police officer.
- Yes.

26:04.148 --> 26:06.245
I mean... what?

26:06.370 --> 26:09.309
I didn't think you were. You
didn't think you were, but

26:09.343 --> 26:10.708
here we are.

26:11.022 --> 26:13.579
Suddenly, the uniform fits.

26:13.795 --> 26:15.763
It's the same uniform.

26:15.888 --> 26:18.703
But you have grown into it.

26:19.212 --> 26:21.338
Meanwhile, after an extensive interview

26:21.351 --> 26:23.029
with the patent-medicine pharmacist,

26:23.046 --> 26:25.731
I came away with the name of
a man who regularly purchased

26:25.744 --> 26:27.002
the pills in question.

26:27.175 --> 26:29.008
- And you know what?
- What?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.217
He's a butcher.

26:32.294 --> 26:33.894
With me, Constable.

26:37.413 --> 26:39.596
I've given your proposal
a great deal of thought.

26:39.721 --> 26:41.257
And have you decided?

26:41.582 --> 26:43.280
- I have.
- So?

26:43.955 --> 26:46.099
Well, I can't tell you
quite yet. I don't feel

26:46.121 --> 26:48.516
I've impressed upon you the
extent of my deliberation.

26:48.551 --> 26:51.214
- This was a real dilemma for me.
- I'm sure it was.

26:51.339 --> 26:53.384
Yes. Well, on one hand there's you.

26:53.621 --> 26:55.715
And you mean the world to me. But then,

26:55.953 --> 26:58.331
there's everything else in
the world that I hold dear.

26:58.556 --> 27:00.017
It's a difficult choice.

27:00.549 --> 27:02.469
If I was you, I'd be flattered.

27:02.702 --> 27:05.962
Here I am equating you, one person,

27:06.022 --> 27:09.274
to all the other people and
places and things in my life.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.373
It's very impressive.

27:10.412 --> 27:13.430
I'm flattered by every minute
you spend with me, George.

27:13.447 --> 27:15.350
All right, don't get saucy.

27:15.986 --> 27:17.179
Here's the thing,

27:17.987 --> 27:19.830
I have a proposal of my own.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.494
If I'm going to be with you,

27:24.016 --> 27:26.883
if I'm going to turn my back
on all those other things,

27:27.280 --> 27:28.928
I want to give you all of me.

27:30.406 --> 27:31.556
Nina Bloom,

27:33.039 --> 27:34.510
will you be my wife?

27:39.053 --> 27:41.383
- No.
- No?

27:41.746 --> 27:44.388
No. I'm sorry. I can't, George.

27:56.015 --> 27:58.389
There are stains on these clothes.

27:59.457 --> 28:00.923
They're very unusual.

28:01.986 --> 28:03.858
I believe they're from formaldehyde.

28:05.419 --> 28:07.248
Why would she have
been working with that?

28:09.401 --> 28:10.716
The funeral home.

28:11.654 --> 28:14.364
Perhaps she knew someone there, or...

28:15.036 --> 28:16.314
she worked there?

28:16.699 --> 28:18.208
With dead bodies?

28:19.112 --> 28:21.723
You said she had
experience cutting hair...

28:21.792 --> 28:24.088
if she had recently moved
to Markham, needed work,

28:24.106 --> 28:26.614
perhaps she took what she could get.

28:27.293 --> 28:28.542
So...

28:29.009 --> 28:30.968
So what does any of this mean?

28:41.228 --> 28:42.940
Hey! What are you doing?

28:46.048 --> 28:47.674
These aren't human ashes.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.009
They're the wrong density.

28:50.398 --> 28:51.860
This is wood.

28:52.642 --> 28:54.713
This is from a fireplace.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.222
I don't understand.

28:56.347 --> 28:58.168
No, it's good. It's good.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.272
It means your wife may
not actually be dead.

29:03.516 --> 29:05.223
The people at the funeral home

29:05.258 --> 29:06.896
were covering something up.

29:07.855 --> 29:09.252
If she did work there,

29:09.278 --> 29:11.025
which would explain these stains,

29:11.659 --> 29:13.792
then perhaps they're
doing it on her behalf...

29:15.252 --> 29:18.552
... which means they helped
her to fake her own death.

29:20.267 --> 29:21.349
But why?

29:22.923 --> 29:24.968
She wanted people to believe

29:25.452 --> 29:26.780
that she was gone.

29:26.987 --> 29:29.599
That she hadn't just left town.

29:30.939 --> 29:32.807
She was running from something...

29:33.724 --> 29:36.596
or someone.

29:38.212 --> 29:40.401
You're right about that, Detective.

30:39.758 --> 30:42.087
It's always important to consider

30:42.120 --> 30:44.102
where your next meal is coming from.

30:54.506 --> 30:57.133
Mr. Lloyd Dixon?

30:57.317 --> 31:00.544
- Can I help you?
- Oh, the Constabulary.

31:01.436 --> 31:04.176
This is for a Mr. Melvin Kulik.

31:04.301 --> 31:06.419
To tell you the truth,
Melvin's running late.

31:06.446 --> 31:09.044
- I'm helping him out.
- Oh, so if we wait around,

31:09.045 --> 31:10.505
we'll get to speak with him?

31:11.630 --> 31:14.733
Or is Mr. Melvin Kulik dead, Lloyd?

31:14.770 --> 31:18.419
No. As far as I know,
he's just late, maybe sick.

31:18.759 --> 31:21.337
- What do you mean, dead?
- Detective.

31:21.958 --> 31:24.406
Perhaps you used this to
cut your friend's arm off?

31:27.562 --> 31:29.026
It was an accident!

31:29.151 --> 31:32.335
Strange sort of accident,
removing a man's limbs.

31:32.378 --> 31:35.621
- And head.
- Yes... and head.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.659
We were fooling around. Melvin
put his head under the blade.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.853
I didn't mean to hit
the switch, I swear!

31:41.896 --> 31:43.674
Come on to the Station House, Mr. Dixon.

31:43.723 --> 31:46.813
It was an accident! I didn't
know what rightly to do is all.

31:46.856 --> 31:48.923
Slicing off the man's
legs isn't the answer

31:48.979 --> 31:51.271
most people would come to, Lloyd.

32:15.474 --> 32:17.218
Just go back to where you came from!

32:17.242 --> 32:18.842
I'm not finished with you yet!

32:18.919 --> 32:20.398
Thought you could get away from me?

32:22.089 --> 32:23.096
You lied to me.

32:23.113 --> 32:25.211
- Why did you bring him here?
- Shut up Annie.

32:25.462 --> 32:27.139
Now you've done your job, Detective.

32:27.164 --> 32:28.907
Now leave and let Annie
and me here settle this.

32:28.924 --> 32:30.477
This has gone far enough, Mr. Beckett.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.380
Don't do anything else you'll regret.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.072
Thank you for your help.

32:36.102 --> 32:39.431
I didn't tell you everything
about my lovely wife, Detective.

32:39.556 --> 32:41.604
How she's the one who
started me gambling

32:41.642 --> 32:44.142
because she needed someone to
stake her. Isn't that right, Annie?

32:44.155 --> 32:45.980
You'd never had so
much fun in your life.

32:46.002 --> 32:47.147
You're right, it was fun.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.954
My life was perfect 'til you
took everything and disappeared.

32:49.997 --> 32:52.033
- Stole it all...
- You wouldn't have made a penny

32:52.034 --> 32:53.141
if it wasn't for me.

32:53.176 --> 32:55.537
- Useless man, thick in the head...
- Shut up Annie.

32:55.554 --> 32:58.365
Do something about this! You're the
one that lead him straight to me.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.424
Do something!

32:59.433 --> 33:01.348
- He won't be leaving here.
- Imagine my luck

33:01.365 --> 33:04.123
when the great William
Murdoch walked into my bar

33:04.124 --> 33:05.788
and sat down right next to me.

33:05.814 --> 33:07.639
But now I'm finished with you Detective.

33:07.678 --> 33:09.360
Well, I'm not finished with you.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.438
Another step and I'll kill her!

33:18.037 --> 33:19.058
Kill him!

33:23.651 --> 33:24.969
Put the knife down.

33:24.987 --> 33:27.705
- You never should have brung him here.
- I know.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.418
Now put the knife down.

33:29.543 --> 33:31.259
I just wanted a new life.

33:31.787 --> 33:34.934
Don't you get it? I
just wanted a new life.

33:35.632 --> 33:37.996
Put the knife down and you have it.

33:38.459 --> 33:39.587
We all do.

33:48.892 --> 33:50.465
Well, I do understand.

33:51.252 --> 33:52.796
Loss changes us.

33:53.453 --> 33:55.676
And although you spoke emotionally,

33:55.689 --> 33:57.323
you were not altogether incorrect.

33:57.963 --> 34:01.227
I may have rushed our study
to the trial stage prematurely.

34:01.279 --> 34:03.259
Well, at my own urging.

34:04.461 --> 34:07.068
I wanted this child very badly.

34:09.978 --> 34:11.674
I need to accept that being a mother

34:11.687 --> 34:13.525
is a door that's closed to me.

34:14.081 --> 34:16.304
The results don't indicate that.

34:16.607 --> 34:18.820
In fact, we achieved
much greater success

34:18.833 --> 34:20.385
than we may have hoped.

34:21.277 --> 34:22.724
That might be true...

34:24.159 --> 34:26.801
... but if you do try
again, it won't be with me.

34:37.704 --> 34:39.174
You wanted to see me?

34:39.840 --> 34:40.925
I do.

34:41.304 --> 34:42.620
About yesterday...

34:42.849 --> 34:44.469
you caught me off guard.

34:45.438 --> 34:47.188
So I wasn't the only one surprised.

34:48.138 --> 34:49.766
I suppose there's a part of me

34:50.004 --> 34:53.056
that can't believe a good man
like you would want to marry me.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.599
Well, a good man asked.

34:57.203 --> 34:58.759
When you proposed...

34:59.166 --> 35:02.438
I was suddenly thinking a
thousand things all at once.

35:03.355 --> 35:04.699
I was thinking...

35:04.777 --> 35:06.657
how beautiful the ring was

35:07.366 --> 35:09.247
and how sweet you are.

35:10.146 --> 35:12.887
And I was thinking how
I never wanted to marry,

35:13.583 --> 35:15.149
but that maybe I could.

35:16.395 --> 35:17.395
Maybe...

35:17.574 --> 35:19.318
you could come to Paris,

35:19.809 --> 35:23.091
and we could spend our
wonderful lives together.

35:24.514 --> 35:27.163
And I was thinking that
I'd be happy doing that.

35:27.972 --> 35:29.255
And then you said no.

35:30.053 --> 35:31.939
Because I know what you want.

35:32.741 --> 35:34.882
You want a wedding,

35:35.217 --> 35:37.497
and a wife and a family,

35:37.622 --> 35:39.699
and I think that that's lovely, but...

35:41.771 --> 35:43.797
... I'm not going to be
able to give you that.

35:44.824 --> 35:46.145
Well, how do you know?

35:46.806 --> 35:49.867
Sometimes the things that
people want can change.

35:50.244 --> 35:52.384
Who's to say I still want all that?

35:54.073 --> 35:56.260
How do you know I wouldn't
give it up for you?

35:57.597 --> 35:59.634
If you wanted just me,

36:00.377 --> 36:02.656
you would have said yes to Paris.

36:04.226 --> 36:06.016
The ring said the rest.

36:12.310 --> 36:13.374
Come here.

36:39.933 --> 36:41.088
Doctor Ogden.

36:43.082 --> 36:44.284
Tom.

36:44.357 --> 36:45.762
Is Murdoch home yet?

36:45.931 --> 36:46.982
No.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.815
And I'm sorry, Tom, but
I can't discuss this.

36:49.901 --> 36:51.972
- No, of course not.
- Thank you.

36:52.508 --> 36:54.742
Look, I wanted to tell you something.

36:54.764 --> 36:57.189
When you lost your child,
I didn't say anything.

36:57.518 --> 36:59.991
I thought these things
were better left unsaid.

37:01.201 --> 37:03.337
I really, I don't need to...

37:03.588 --> 37:04.682
Julia...

37:05.015 --> 37:07.030
losing a child is a terrible thing.

37:07.052 --> 37:09.901
I don't care if it's an unborn
baby or a fully-grown adult.

37:10.381 --> 37:11.950
It's the worst pain that you and Murdoch

37:11.963 --> 37:13.498
have had in your lives together.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.318
But you'll get through it.

37:15.443 --> 37:16.525
Both of you.

37:17.286 --> 37:19.642
- Do you believe so?
- Yes I do.

37:20.256 --> 37:22.544
Take time away from
the morgue, of course.

37:22.622 --> 37:23.984
But promise me one thing.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.432
What's that?

37:25.657 --> 37:27.814
No letters of resignation today.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.638
You're not thinking
clearly at a time like this.

37:31.464 --> 37:32.601
Sometimes...

37:32.683 --> 37:34.659
crisis brings clarity.

37:35.506 --> 37:36.812
You might be right.

37:37.348 --> 37:39.981
But don't make any decisions
that you can't undo.

37:56.758 --> 38:00.247
I must say, the morgue suits me
much more than I ever expected.

38:00.650 --> 38:02.557
The science, the precision,

38:02.682 --> 38:04.999
the puzzling out of obscure details.

38:05.726 --> 38:08.006
Dr. Ogden's absence
allowed me to realise

38:08.010 --> 38:10.196
I am quite capable
of doing it on my own.

38:11.338 --> 38:13.565
I do worry about her,
though. She's been...

38:13.777 --> 38:15.567
rather distracted as of late.

38:15.637 --> 38:17.595
Erratic, emotional...

38:17.902 --> 38:19.605
It's quite sad to see.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.009
She does mean so much to me, after all.

38:23.609 --> 38:26.714
Sounds to me like you'd be better
off running the place yourself.

38:27.146 --> 38:29.973
Well, I'm not nearly
finished my schooling yet.

38:30.038 --> 38:33.046
I suppose I do have years
of medical experience.

38:33.090 --> 38:35.653
I have a thing or two to
do with solving your case.

38:36.258 --> 38:37.772
What exactly are you after?

38:37.858 --> 38:38.952
After?

38:39.129 --> 38:41.023
You ask me here. You tell me

38:41.045 --> 38:43.069
the doctor's no longer up to the task.

38:43.086 --> 38:45.499
I'm thinking you want me
to do something about it.

38:45.815 --> 38:49.266
Well, I can't bring any of these
concerns to anyone at Station Four.

38:49.503 --> 38:51.083
They'd all defend the detective's wife

38:51.097 --> 38:52.477
no matter the circumstance.

38:52.768 --> 38:55.531
So you want me to go
around them and pass word

38:55.569 --> 38:57.607
of her performance to
the Chief Constable.

38:58.413 --> 39:00.668
I simply want you to tell the truth.

39:01.491 --> 39:02.702
Why would I help you?

39:04.697 --> 39:06.129
Because you want to.

39:08.623 --> 39:09.973
Is that right?

39:11.039 --> 39:12.585
Yes, Inspector.

39:12.889 --> 39:15.550
You and I are going to
be the best of friends.

39:18.041 --> 39:20.126
Or more than friends.

39:29.310 --> 39:31.053
I'd like to be alone, George.

39:32.925 --> 39:35.520
If that were true, sir, you
wouldn't be so easily found.

39:36.886 --> 39:38.017
Ahem.

39:39.428 --> 39:41.327
I asked Nina Bloom to marry me.

39:43.803 --> 39:44.879
Good for you.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.412
She said no.

39:47.682 --> 39:48.682
Oh.

39:50.424 --> 39:51.424
I'm sorry.

39:51.802 --> 39:54.406
Well, that's just it,
sir. I'm not so sure I am.

39:55.008 --> 39:57.519
I mean, I was devastated
in the moment of course,

39:58.484 --> 39:59.926
but as I walked away,

40:00.099 --> 40:01.192
I felt...

40:02.012 --> 40:03.012
light.

40:04.597 --> 40:07.708
I felt as if a... a
load had been lifted.

40:08.374 --> 40:10.899
I mean, she's an
extraordinary woman but...

40:11.297 --> 40:12.521
for me,

40:13.260 --> 40:17.569
for the things I truly believe I want,

40:18.862 --> 40:21.102
she's not the one. Do
you know what I mean?

40:22.684 --> 40:24.067
I believe I do.

40:24.357 --> 40:25.541
Which makes me think

40:25.584 --> 40:28.823
if somebody was so fortunate
as to find that person,

40:28.849 --> 40:30.802
why would you ever throw that away?

40:33.072 --> 40:35.022
I don't think she'll
have me back, George.

40:35.147 --> 40:36.557
Of course she'll have you back.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.921
I lost my temper,

40:38.978 --> 40:41.365
- said some things.
- Who hasn't done that?

40:42.429 --> 40:44.871
Some things I may even believe.

40:45.338 --> 40:47.163
Well, sir, what's more important to you?

40:47.181 --> 40:49.122
Those things, or her?

40:51.794 --> 40:52.794
Both.

40:53.541 --> 40:55.503
Well, if you'll beg my pardon, sir,

40:55.901 --> 40:57.557
perhaps you should find out

40:57.760 --> 41:00.201
if those two things
could exist together.

41:01.734 --> 41:04.328
Another mystery for
me to solve, eh George?

41:05.074 --> 41:07.727
Well, you don't need to be William
Murdoch to solve that one, sir.

41:08.451 --> 41:11.623
She's the one for you.
You know it. I know it.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.027
Hello.

41:34.103 --> 41:35.504
Hello, William.

41:40.766 --> 41:41.899
You're leaving?

41:47.957 --> 41:50.210
I don't know quite what to say.

41:52.869 --> 41:55.779
But if you want to leave,
that's certainly your right.

41:56.138 --> 41:58.006
You don't need to tell me that.

42:02.074 --> 42:04.720
- I was hurt.
- We were both hurt.

42:07.318 --> 42:10.297
But what I did was inexcusable
in your eyes, at least.

42:12.052 --> 42:14.543
It's possible we'll
never find common ground.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.285
I know.

42:17.267 --> 42:18.745
But it doesn't matter.

42:21.863 --> 42:24.171
We are not the same, Julia.

42:25.468 --> 42:28.302
We've been different
every day of our marriage.

42:30.404 --> 42:33.023
But I count every
single one of those days

42:33.057 --> 42:35.151
as the happiest in my life.

42:37.374 --> 42:38.706
And that's enough?

42:40.716 --> 42:41.848
I think so.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.027
Are you certain?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.059
If we never have a child,

42:52.014 --> 42:53.443
it doesn't matter.

42:55.508 --> 42:57.514
What matters is that we're together.

43:00.535 --> 43:04.105
Your love means more
to me than everything.

43:06.728 --> 43:08.479
William...

43:09.879 --> 43:11.500
Please don't go.

43:16.956 --> 43:18.712
I won't.

43:19.802 --> 43:21.679
I'll tear the ticket up.

43:21.852 --> 43:24.219
- No.
- No?

43:26.743 --> 43:28.224
Let's buy another one.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.294
Oh...
