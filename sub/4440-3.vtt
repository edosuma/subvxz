00:20.110 --> 00:22.446
What?!

00:26.941 --> 00:29.921
I mean, I used to be invisible to him, but

00:29.922 --> 00:32.051
now he keeps looking at me,

00:32.086 --> 00:34.649
like he knew we stole
these plants from him.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.028
I'm just being paranoid, right?

00:37.029 --> 00:39.663
Well, these buds are called
Purple Thunder Paranoia,

00:39.664 --> 00:41.498
but no, you're not being paranoid.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.100
No, of course I am.

00:44.101 --> 00:46.836
Like right now, it looks
like he's coming over here.

00:46.837 --> 00:50.039
He looks pissed. Why would he
be coming over here pissed?

00:50.040 --> 00:52.443
I don't know, Ryan. Maybe
because you smashed his window,

00:52.444 --> 00:54.345
stole his weed and shat in his boot?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.846
You smashed his window.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.950
You, me. What's the difference?

01:00.656 --> 01:02.543
What is the difference?

01:14.068 --> 01:17.537
Wilfred, I think there's
something in that weed.

01:17.538 --> 01:20.207
I don't think so, mate,

01:20.208 --> 01:23.210
but there's only one way to find out.

01:34.988 --> 01:37.791
Yeah, that doesn't happen till later.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.733
Later? What are you...?

01:41.280 --> 01:43.293
Wilfred what's going on?

01:43.328 --> 01:45.500
Am I dreaming?
I want to wake up now.

01:45.501 --> 01:47.702
Ryan, there's something I need to tell you.

01:47.703 --> 01:49.204
I don't think you'll remember this,

01:49.205 --> 01:50.539
but perhaps that's for the best.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.175
None of this is real.

01:52.176 --> 01:54.010
There's no way he could know it was me.

01:54.011 --> 01:55.712
That's the thing I need to tell you, mate.

01:55.713 --> 01:58.448
He knows.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.366
Up for a stroll, mate?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.906
Oh. It's for you.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.144
Open it.

02:23.145 --> 02:25.346
You don't have to say,
"Open it," okay, Ryan?

02:25.347 --> 02:26.547
I know to open it.

02:29.084 --> 02:31.719
It's a Kobe beef femur
from a high-end butcher.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.454
It's the best money can buy.

02:33.455 --> 02:36.724
Feel that weight.

02:36.725 --> 02:38.793
Oh, I thought you'd be excited.

02:38.794 --> 02:40.394
You want me to be excited, Ryan?

02:40.395 --> 02:41.862
Buy me a new bong.

02:41.863 --> 02:43.597
Or better yet, a vaporizer.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.934
But a bone? It's like giving
a basketball to a black guy.

02:46.935 --> 02:49.169
It was meant to be a
token of our friendship.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.005
Oh, speaking of tokin',

02:50.040 --> 02:52.799
let's spark up some of that
weed we nicked from Spencer.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.642
Maybe we can vaporize it in my new bone.

02:57.587 --> 02:58.646
Hmm. No.

02:58.647 --> 03:00.415
Won't quite work, will it?

03:00.416 --> 03:01.716
What's going on here?

03:01.717 --> 03:03.785
What kind of racist monster

03:03.786 --> 03:06.254
would spray-paint the symbol
of another person's culture?

03:06.255 --> 03:08.490
It's a hate crime!

03:09.415 --> 03:12.059
Hey white boy, is that your dog?

03:12.060 --> 03:13.961
No, I'm just watching him for a friend.

03:13.962 --> 03:16.263
My wife is extremely fearful of dogs.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.935
Lakshmi was bitten in the old neighborhood.

03:17.970 --> 03:21.206
We had to call Animal Control
and put the beast down.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.269
So would you please?!

03:23.270 --> 03:24.404
Wilfred,

03:24.405 --> 03:27.106
come!

03:27.107 --> 03:28.908
Please?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.476
It's not like I was gonna bite her.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.012
Last time I had Indian,
it gave me the shits for a week.

03:36.182 --> 03:40.119
Come back to the scene of the crime,
didn't you? I know it was you!

03:40.120 --> 03:43.622
I know it was you!

03:43.623 --> 03:46.192
I had to call the cops on
that hoodlum a few weeks ago.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.861
I'm certain this is his revenge.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.965
That motorcycle dick is
ruining the neighborhood.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.634
You need to put that asshole in his place.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.736
What's the point of a confrontation?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.338
I'd just get my ass kicked.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.140
So what? That'd be less painful

04:00.141 --> 04:01.742
than walking around in constant fear.

04:01.743 --> 04:05.280
What would you suggest I do?

04:05.281 --> 04:08.216
March over there,
look him straight in the eye,

04:08.217 --> 04:10.818
and say, "I'm the man
who shat in your boot."

04:10.853 --> 04:13.672
and then you *** and *** in the ass

04:13.707 --> 04:16.491
You want me to have sex with him?

04:16.492 --> 04:18.493
It's called domination.

04:18.494 --> 04:21.396
That's how dogs handle it,
and believe me, it's very effective.

04:21.397 --> 04:23.465
And have you done this with another dog?

04:23.466 --> 04:25.821
Every goddamn day.

04:25.856 --> 04:27.581
I can't imagine a scenario

04:27.616 --> 04:29.771
in which I would do something like that.

04:29.772 --> 04:33.341
Well then, you have no imagination.

04:33.342 --> 04:35.710
If only that were true.

04:35.711 --> 04:39.122
I mean, I used to be
invisible to him, but...

04:39.157 --> 04:41.288
but now he keeps looking at me,

04:41.323 --> 04:43.916
like-like he knew we stole
these plants from him.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.721
I'm just being paranoid, right?

04:46.756 --> 04:47.589
Well, these buds

04:47.590 --> 04:49.658
are called Purple Thunder Paranoia,

04:49.659 --> 04:51.326
but no, you're not being paranoid.

04:51.327 --> 04:53.194
Of course I am.

05:05.741 --> 05:07.742
Ryan, there's something I need to tell you.

05:10.813 --> 05:12.547
- Is that...?
- It is.

05:12.548 --> 05:15.383
Mate, the thing is, he knows.

05:15.384 --> 05:17.718
- How is that possible?
- Because after

05:17.719 --> 05:19.420
we broke into his house,

05:19.421 --> 05:22.690
I think I may have left your
wallet under the window.

05:22.691 --> 05:23.958
- What?!
- Actually,

05:23.959 --> 05:25.827
wait. No, no.

05:25.828 --> 05:28.496
I definitely did do that.

05:37.632 --> 05:39.033
I know you're in there!

05:39.068 --> 05:41.258
Why the hell would you leave
my wallet outside his window?

05:41.293 --> 05:43.817
I don't know, Ryan. Why is the sky grey?

05:43.818 --> 05:45.418
Why is the grass grey?

05:45.419 --> 05:47.520
Why is a rainbow grey, grey,

05:47.521 --> 05:50.289
grey, grey, grey and infra-grey?

05:50.290 --> 05:54.893
Now open the door, pull down
his pants and tear that ass up.

05:57.464 --> 05:59.998
Hey, Ryan, lose something?!

05:59.999 --> 06:02.500
Uh. Oh, wow, I've been looking for this.

06:02.501 --> 06:04.001
Yeah, because you dropped it

06:04.002 --> 06:06.604
when you broke into my house,
you piece of shit.

06:06.605 --> 06:08.789
Enough words, Ryan! I'll hold him down,
you get his pants off.

06:08.824 --> 06:09.972
No! No, no, no, no, no.

06:10.007 --> 06:10.986
I can explain.

06:11.021 --> 06:13.646
Yeah, go ahead, but I'm
not a very good listener.

06:13.647 --> 06:16.882
They, uh... they-they
broke into my house, too!

06:16.883 --> 06:18.617
Come on, Ryan.

06:18.618 --> 06:20.252
Only a complete tosser would believe...

06:20.253 --> 06:21.354
Keep talking. Yeah.

06:21.355 --> 06:22.789
They stole my wallet.

06:22.790 --> 06:24.190
They-They must have dropped it

06:24.191 --> 06:26.059
when they broke into your house.

06:26.060 --> 06:27.561
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.063
No! N-No bullshit, and

06:29.064 --> 06:32.900
that sick bastard actually
took a dump on my Blu-ray.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.681
- He shit in my boots!
- Yeah.

06:36.871 --> 06:38.688
Guess you think you're
pretty clever, eh, Ryan?

06:38.723 --> 06:40.597
Yeah, well,

06:40.841 --> 06:43.376
looks like we're both victims here.

06:43.377 --> 06:46.211
I'm sorry, I-I didn't even get your name.

06:46.212 --> 06:47.379
Oh, it's Spencer.

06:47.380 --> 06:49.114
You know, it's funny.

06:49.115 --> 06:50.515
I... I've seen you around the neighborhood,

06:50.516 --> 06:52.350
and I... I always figured you were a dick,

06:52.351 --> 06:55.688
but now I feel like I'm the dick.

06:55.689 --> 06:58.324
I'm sorry I barged in on you.

06:58.325 --> 07:01.128
Hey, it's fine. Anytime.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.696
ah.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.937
You make me sick.

07:08.938 --> 07:11.239
Oh, you're mad at me? You set me up!

07:11.240 --> 07:13.475
- You pussed out!
- I did not puss out.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.076
Sometimes when I look at you,

07:15.077 --> 07:16.578
I can almost see a giant tampon string

07:16.579 --> 07:18.146
hanging out of you. Ryan, you can't

07:18.147 --> 07:19.616
run away from your problems.

07:19.651 --> 07:21.438
I'll take care of this my way,

07:21.473 --> 07:23.219
the way that did not get my ass kicked.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.087
He's gone, and he's not coming back.

07:25.088 --> 07:27.524
Well, that's interesting,
because he's at the front door.

07:27.525 --> 07:29.192
No, he's not.

07:34.532 --> 07:37.033
Hey,

07:37.034 --> 07:39.574
now that I think you're cool,
and you think I'm cool,

07:39.609 --> 07:41.464
I was thinking we can hang out.

07:41.465 --> 07:42.465
Oh. Hmm...

07:42.973 --> 07:44.774
You like porn? God, listen to me.

07:44.775 --> 07:46.542
What am I, some kind of idiot?

07:46.543 --> 07:48.277
Who doesn't like porn?

07:49.278 --> 07:51.696
Damm, this shit gets my rock hard.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.617
You too, right?

07:55.618 --> 07:58.186
Uh...

07:58.187 --> 07:59.620
Yeah... I guess.

07:59.621 --> 08:00.955
Having fun, Ryan?

08:00.956 --> 08:03.991
Just another lazy Sunday watching porn

08:03.992 --> 08:05.659
with your drunk, rock-hard neighbor.

08:05.660 --> 08:07.327
It's all good.

08:07.328 --> 08:09.296
I'm having a great time, too, buddy.

08:09.297 --> 08:12.226
Hard to believe four hours ago,
we didn't even know each other.

08:12.261 --> 08:15.467
Four hours? Yeah!

08:15.502 --> 08:17.671
Hey, how... how long does
that battery last anyway?

08:17.672 --> 08:20.041
Oh, shit! I should have brought my cord.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.509
You're not a Mac guy, are you?

08:21.510 --> 08:23.411
Oh, well, the thing is, I...

08:23.412 --> 08:25.983
Nice save! Good doggy!

08:26.018 --> 08:30.685
Yeah! Now we can porn out all night!

08:30.720 --> 08:32.620
Uh, well, let me... let me just

08:32.621 --> 08:35.990
feed Wilfred his lunch,
and then we can resume

08:35.991 --> 08:38.058
porning out.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.632
Okay, lunch-wise, I'm thinking

08:44.633 --> 08:46.133
a thinly-sliced porterhouse on a...

08:46.134 --> 08:47.935
I'm not making you lunch, Wilfred!

08:47.936 --> 08:50.504
It's like you're torturing me for fun. Why?

08:50.505 --> 08:52.574
I'm giving you a gift,

08:52.575 --> 08:54.542
and it pains me to watch you squander it.

08:54.543 --> 08:57.511
A gift?! What you're
giving me is a sociopathic,

08:57.546 --> 08:59.115
porn-crazed pain in the ass.

08:59.150 --> 09:00.314
Oh, I forgot.

09:00.315 --> 09:02.684
You're the resident
authority on gift giving.

09:02.685 --> 09:05.587
- That bone is a nice gift.
- It's a shit gift!

09:05.588 --> 09:07.822
What I'm giving you is far more valuable.

09:07.823 --> 09:09.457
A chance to be rid of that
knuckle-dragging asshole

09:09.458 --> 09:11.059
once and for all.

09:11.060 --> 09:13.495
I'm gonna get rid of him... my way.

09:15.231 --> 09:18.400
Hey buddy, I think I'm a little porned out.

09:18.401 --> 09:20.235
Oh, I get it.

09:20.236 --> 09:22.237
Say no more. I, uh...

09:22.238 --> 09:24.640
Sometimes I come on a little bit strong.

09:24.641 --> 09:26.442
You know, at least,
that's what my caseworker says.

09:26.443 --> 09:28.110
So enough porn.

09:28.111 --> 09:28.878
Yeah.

09:28.913 --> 09:30.946
Let's hit the titty bar!

09:30.947 --> 09:34.516
Oh, that... that... that sounds fun, um,

09:34.517 --> 09:36.318
but I-I really should...

09:36.319 --> 09:38.987
I should clean out the poop
from the Blu-ray player.

09:38.988 --> 09:40.421
It's been a few days, so...

09:40.422 --> 09:42.089
Oh. Oh, okay.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.288
Okay, rain check, buddy. Okay.

09:43.323 --> 09:47.194
Hey Ryan some of that
weed we stole off Spencer!

09:47.195 --> 09:49.763
- What is up with your dog?
- Yeah, stolen weed right here.

09:49.764 --> 09:51.566
- I'll bring it up.
- He is, like, freaking out.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.201
- Shouldn't we see what's up?
- No. Hey.

09:53.202 --> 09:55.236
- You know what? Let's go
to the titty bar. - Great!

when you have a transsexual
stripper for a dad.

10:44.654 --> 10:47.790
Now, he had perfect breasts.

10:47.791 --> 10:51.393

Listen, Spencer, there's
something I need to tell you.

11:11.078 --> 11:13.113
You can tell me anything, Ryan.

11:13.114 --> 11:17.383
And I want you to be
completely honest with me.

11:17.384 --> 11:18.317
My last buddy...

11:18.318 --> 11:20.053
Jesse...

11:20.054 --> 11:22.121
he was a liar and a thief.

11:22.122 --> 11:26.826
And that's why I punched him
in the throat and rip off his ear!

11:26.827 --> 11:28.694
Now, what'd you want to tell me?

11:28.695 --> 11:32.665
I was just gonna say, um...

11:32.666 --> 11:35.435
th-that stripper has weird breasts.

11:35.470 --> 11:38.176
Oh nice! Where?

11:38.211 --> 11:38.537
Her?

11:38.538 --> 11:39.972
Her?

11:44.577 --> 11:45.677
Mm.

11:45.678 --> 11:47.812
That was weird.

11:51.383 --> 11:52.831
Well, see you around.

11:53.052 --> 11:56.321
Hey, I got half a bottle of schlag
and taco shells inside.

11:56.322 --> 11:57.856
The night is young.

11:57.857 --> 12:00.125
Schlag and taco shells it is!

12:00.126 --> 12:01.493
W-Wilfred, come here!

12:01.494 --> 12:03.996
Relax. I know how to get him back.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.368
Look at that dumb dog.

12:09.369 --> 12:11.504
Ryan!

12:12.114 --> 12:13.367
Are you seeing this?

12:16.880 --> 12:18.982
This... defys...

12:19.017 --> 12:20.847
all... logic!

12:24.385 --> 12:25.886
Why...

12:25.887 --> 12:27.654
can't I...

12:27.655 --> 12:29.489
catch... it?

12:29.964 --> 12:32.979
Ryan... make it stop.

12:33.014 --> 12:36.163
I'm begging you, do something!

12:36.164 --> 12:37.865
Wilfred's been misbehaving all day.

12:37.866 --> 12:39.733
He deserves this.

12:39.734 --> 12:41.802
Okay, check this out.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.808
Where are you, you gray bastard?

12:48.877 --> 12:50.911
Show yourself!

12:50.912 --> 12:53.380
Let's finish this!

12:53.381 --> 12:55.049
What's going on? What's all the noise?

12:56.418 --> 12:58.453
There you are.

12:58.454 --> 12:59.454
Wilfred, no!

13:02.527 --> 13:04.295
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Don't worry,

13:04.296 --> 13:06.563
we're gonna take him to a nice farm upstate.

13:06.564 --> 13:07.798
Ooh, a farm.

13:07.799 --> 13:09.967
With duckies and piggies and ponies.

13:09.968 --> 13:12.369
I wonder if I can kill a pony.

13:12.370 --> 13:15.839
There must be something I can do. Please.

13:17.142 --> 13:19.209
All right, give me 50 bucks,

13:19.210 --> 13:22.280
I'll leave him leashed up to the
Dumpster behind Animal Control.

13:22.281 --> 13:23.915
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:23.916 --> 13:26.968
Hey, Ryan! I just found this Persian chick

13:27.003 --> 13:30.078
on Craig's List who said she'll
let us throw a shoe at her.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.191
What the hell is he doing here!

13:32.192 --> 13:35.160
Spencer. Jesse.

13:35.161 --> 13:37.696
- Wait. You're Jesse?
- Yeah, that's

13:37.697 --> 13:39.932
the little bitch who stole my girlfriend

13:39.933 --> 13:40.999
<i>and my toaster oven.</i>

13:41.000 --> 13:43.068
You banged my mom!

13:43.069 --> 13:45.937
One time! And I texted you
the minute I finished!

13:45.938 --> 13:47.505
I didn't lie about it!

13:47.506 --> 13:49.592
You're friends with this jerk?

13:49.627 --> 13:50.174
Best friends.

13:50.175 --> 13:51.575
Huh.

13:51.576 --> 13:52.843
Well, in that case...

13:52.844 --> 13:55.112
the deal's off!

13:55.113 --> 13:58.049
Oh, and by the way, there is no farm.

13:58.050 --> 14:00.385
He's getting the needle.

14:01.988 --> 14:03.522
So long, Ryan.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.758
Come visit me at the farm.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.410
Bring bread for the ducks!

14:13.663 --> 14:16.932
What the hell?
I told you the deal was off.

14:17.019 --> 14:18.004
And why you bring him?

14:18.039 --> 14:20.040
I'm onlye here becaue my new best friend

14:20.041 --> 14:21.708
asked me to come.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.910
You two have some things to talk about.

14:23.911 --> 14:26.812
Right, Spencer?

14:26.813 --> 14:29.720
In the meantime, may I have five minutes
alone to say good-bye to my dog?

14:30.883 --> 14:32.917
Ten cages down on your right.

14:36.956 --> 14:40.052
Yeah, I hear you yapping.
You want the smokes,

14:40.087 --> 14:41.839
but what are you gonna do for me?

14:41.874 --> 14:43.161
You think it was easy smuggling these in?

14:43.162 --> 14:45.430
Believe me, it didn't tickle coming out.

14:48.410 --> 14:49.561
It's about time.

14:50.501 --> 14:51.046
Good to go?

14:51.081 --> 14:53.018
I'm working on it.

14:53.217 --> 14:57.388
Look, I shouldn't have let Spencer tease
you with that laser pointer.

14:57.741 --> 14:58.697
I'm sorry.

15:01.519 --> 15:02.813
Apology accepted.

15:04.601 --> 15:07.133
Isn't there something you'd
like to apologize for?

15:07.600 --> 15:10.019
No that I can think, no.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.017
My wallet?

15:12.052 --> 15:13.786
Everything else you've put me through today?

15:13.821 --> 15:15.521
Why would I apologize for giving you a gift?

15:15.556 --> 15:16.827
If anything, a thank you would be nice.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.096
Uh, yeah, she was your girlfriend,

15:19.097 --> 15:20.664
but she was a prostitute!

15:20.665 --> 15:23.100
You knew damn well she
didn't work on Saturdays!

15:23.101 --> 15:25.270
You banged her on Shabbas, man!

15:25.271 --> 15:28.039
Seems like you've got everything
under control, eh, Ryan?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.742
Getting my ass kicked is
not gonna solve anything.

15:30.743 --> 15:35.279
Ryan, will you please tell this
lying thief the mining of loyalty?

15:35.280 --> 15:38.783
Oh, right! This coming from the
guy who took advantage of my mom!

15:38.784 --> 15:42.153
My sweet, innocent mom
when she was on ecstasy!

15:42.154 --> 15:44.321
Okay, guys, enough!

15:45.849 --> 15:48.559
Spencer, you may not think what you
did to Jesse was wrong,

15:48.560 --> 15:51.724
but he thinks it was wrong,
and he was hurt by it.

15:51.759 --> 15:53.549
The same goes for you too, Jesse.

15:54.098 --> 15:56.500
And if caring about

15:56.501 --> 15:58.937
your best friend's feelings
isn't important to you,

15:58.938 --> 16:01.815
then maybe you don't know
what friendship really is.

16:06.012 --> 16:08.703
Aw, take your mutt.

16:08.738 --> 16:10.382
I'll lose the paperwork.

16:10.383 --> 16:11.250
Thank you.

16:14.367 --> 16:17.333
You... watched any porn lately?

16:18.693 --> 16:21.015
I have a government job,

16:21.434 --> 16:23.750
all I do is watch porn.

16:26.258 --> 16:28.701
Oh, hey, Ryan, do you mind if I, um...

16:28.702 --> 16:30.737
Not at all. Go porn out.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.941
So, Spencer's back with Jesse,

16:34.942 --> 16:37.577
and I didn't get my ass kicked.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.814
Guess I can run away from my problems.

16:40.815 --> 16:42.716
Hey!

16:42.717 --> 16:44.777
The third amigo has arrived!

16:44.812 --> 16:46.323
- And the saga continues.
- I was just

16:46.358 --> 16:48.388
on my way over to Spencer's
to grab the schlag.

16:48.389 --> 16:51.425
Nice! You brought food for the crew!

16:54.014 --> 16:56.374
Jesse and I let ourselves in.
I hope you don't mind.

16:56.409 --> 16:58.131
I don't mind, Ryan. Do you mind? Oh!

16:58.132 --> 17:00.000
Okay, here's what I'm thinking, all right?

17:00.739 --> 17:03.344
****

17:03.379 --> 17:04.372
bottle rocket fight.

17:04.373 --> 17:06.691
Then, assuming there's no major burns,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.010
we head over to the waterslide park.

17:09.011 --> 17:11.311
And after that, we go to the bar,

17:11.313 --> 17:13.381
where the bartender
won't even throw us out

17:13.382 --> 17:15.250
because it's, like, the best bar ever.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.951
I shat in your boot.

17:18.448 --> 17:19.229
What?

17:19.263 --> 17:21.742
I broke your window, I stole your weed,

17:21.778 --> 17:23.431
and I took a shit in your boot.

17:23.465 --> 17:25.084
And then I lied to your face.

17:25.118 --> 17:25.858
Why?

17:25.858 --> 17:29.052
Because you're an asshole, Spencer.

17:29.087 --> 17:31.399
<i>How am I an asshole?</i>

17:31.434 --> 17:33.165
Because you-you rev your motorcycle

17:33.166 --> 17:34.934
at all hours of the night,

17:34.935 --> 17:38.037
you sprayed the Patels' statue,
and you leave your damn

17:38.038 --> 17:40.406
trash cans in front of my damn garage all...

17:40.407 --> 17:43.009
You steal from me,

17:43.010 --> 17:45.111
lie to me! I am gonna rip your...

17:48.126 --> 17:49.514
You all right, mate?

17:51.228 --> 17:52.286
Am I all right?

17:52.287 --> 17:53.989
Oh.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.994
Oh.

17:56.557 --> 17:58.502
I lost a tooth.

17:59.753 --> 18:02.974
And I think he may have
broken my eye socket.

18:07.611 --> 18:09.103
I was in a fight.

18:11.496 --> 18:13.139
With a scary dude.

18:13.140 --> 18:16.243
And I'm all right!

18:16.999 --> 18:18.058
Thanks, Wilfred.

18:18.093 --> 18:19.825
Thank you.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.499
This turn out to be a pretty *** gift after.

18:26.384 --> 18:27.590
What the hell?

18:27.625 --> 18:31.276
- I, uh... - He has ten seconds
to get his friend out of your house.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.527
You have ten seconds
to get your friend out of my house.

18:33.531 --> 18:34.965
Or else the same thing's
gonna happen to him.

18:34.966 --> 18:37.307
Or else the same thing's
gonna happen to you.

18:37.342 --> 18:38.135
Oh, shit, man!

18:38.136 --> 18:39.704
And if you ever see his
face again, you're gonna

18:39.705 --> 18:42.300
slash his family's throats in their sleep
and then go to their funerals

18:42.335 --> 18:44.075
and slaughter everyone who shows up.

18:44.076 --> 18:45.843
Oh, that's gold. Say that, Ryan.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.274
I'm not saying that.

18:48.691 --> 18:50.088
You're such a pussy.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.183
I owe you, this is a tough one.

19:17.193 --> 19:20.062
Um, I guess I'd screw Toto,

19:20.063 --> 19:22.164
marry Lassie and kill Marmaduke.

19:22.165 --> 19:23.666
Your turn.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.613
Oh, no thanks. Dogs aren't really my thing.

19:25.648 --> 19:27.618
Answer the question Ryan.

19:27.653 --> 19:29.470
Uh... all right.

19:29.471 --> 19:32.646
- I guess I'd screw Anne Hathaway.
- No, no, she's not on the list.

19:32.681 --> 19:34.608
Go pick someone on the list.

19:35.864 --> 19:37.211
These are all dogs.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.463
Ok. Lassie.

19:43.385 --> 19:45.219
You can't screw Lassie.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.892
She's my wife!

19:46.927 --> 19:48.779
Now pick someone of the list!

19:49.223 --> 19:52.492
The only other name on here is Scrappy-Doo.

19:52.493 --> 19:55.362
That's sick, Ryan. He's only ten months old.

19:55.363 --> 19:57.597
What, you-you into kiddies?
Is that your thing?

19:57.598 --> 19:59.332
I didn't have any other choice!

19:59.333 --> 20:00.600
You could have taken a pass.

20:04.035 --> 20:05.199
You're doing it wrong.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.746
No, I'm not.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.374
You're missing the whole point of the toy.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.944
Here, give it here.
