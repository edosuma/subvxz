Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:22.254
(speaking Spanish
angrily)

00:23.323 --> 00:24.556
<i>Horriblé!</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.658
You're not the only one
who knows Spanish!

00:26.660 --> 00:29.194
<i>Arroz con pollo!</i>
<i>Dos</i> margaritas!

00:29.196 --> 00:30.562
Gloria Estefan!

00:30.564 --> 00:32.798
Guys, guys, I have had
a long day at work.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.299
I just want to watch some TV.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.235
I don't want to listen
to you two argue.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.003
He do my word puzzles!

00:38.005 --> 00:40.139
She doesn't understand
how word searches work.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.940
She just circles
every letter.

00:42.909 --> 00:44.710
My way more fun!

00:45.845 --> 00:47.980
She's also drunk
on the job!

00:47.982 --> 00:49.415
(gasps)

00:49.417 --> 00:51.817
That lie!

00:52.819 --> 00:55.621
I drink <i>before </i>
<i>I get here!</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:01.226
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo.

01:04.931 --> 01:05.998
Hey, guys,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.266
I got your coffee.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.835
Mmm, the last
pumpkin spice latte

01:09.837 --> 01:11.336
of the season.
Mm-hmm.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.073
Tomorrow, everything
turns to peppermint.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.576
Mmm.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.011
Well, thank you
for getting 'em, Crawford.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.412
You got 'em so quick.

01:20.414 --> 01:24.249
Yeah, they give it to you faster
if you say your name is Hitler.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.188
Hey, guys, I'm so sorry.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.356
The INS busted a huge
sweatshop in the basement

01:31.358 --> 01:33.192
and I couldn't get up here.
What?!

01:33.194 --> 01:35.260
Oh, yeah, there's sweatshops
all over this country.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.895
It's terrible.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.699
That's why I always look
for that "Made in China" label.

01:41.968 --> 01:45.771
Anyway, uh, the INS is sweeping
the whole building

01:45.773 --> 01:46.905
for illegal immigrants.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.440
Illegal immigrants?
Sweeping?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.809
Oh, my God! Edna!

01:53.713 --> 01:56.215
It's so sad how many little
steps he needs to take

01:56.217 --> 01:57.783
just to go somewhere.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.619
Edna! No!

02:00.621 --> 02:02.588
I'm sorry, sir.
I have to detain her.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.823
No, I'm-I'm sure this
is just a misunderstanding.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.726
Her only form of I.D. was a
picture of a cake that said,

02:07.728 --> 02:10.229
"Happy Birthday, Edna."

02:11.331 --> 02:13.665
They let me get on plane
with it.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.335
I don't understand.
How did this happen?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.569
He turn me in!

02:17.571 --> 02:19.238
Yes, he did.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.840
He's a hero.
Thank you, sir.

02:21.842 --> 02:25.344
These illegal immigrants
are a danger to our way of life.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.079
How?

02:27.081 --> 02:29.915
I don't know.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.250
Look, Edna, Edna,
don't worry.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.186
We will figure
something out.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.188
Good-bye, Eli.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.757
Take care of my mop.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.663
<i>Mijo,</i> you stay with Eli.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.504
What the hell
did you do?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.106
Nothing! An officer came
to the door

02:54.108 --> 02:58.143
looking for illegal immigrants,
and I pointed at Edna.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.545
Why didn't you lie?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.813
Because turning in others is how

03:01.815 --> 03:03.949
this family has survived
every major war.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.786
Well, congratulations, you're
now ruining people's lives

03:07.788 --> 03:09.221
without even leaving the couch!

03:09.223 --> 03:11.823
Listen, I feel terrible!

03:11.825 --> 03:13.692
Mmm. Good sandwich.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.826
I don't know how

03:14.828 --> 03:16.328
you sleep at night.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.897
On my stomach, so no one tries

03:18.899 --> 03:21.633
any funny business
with my thing.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.202
What about your "back thing"?

03:23.204 --> 03:26.805
If they want to risk Vesuvius,
go ahead.

03:29.842 --> 03:33.212
I always thought I'd do
very well in prison.

03:34.414 --> 03:39.685
It's mostly reading
and avoiding eye contact.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.321
Both of which I enjoy.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.522
Are you kidding me?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.324
So many people would want
to stab you,

03:45.326 --> 03:48.060
they'd have to do it in shifts.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.001
Why you bring him?

03:56.003 --> 03:58.237
Edna...

04:00.106 --> 04:01.206
How are you?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.342
It's okay so far.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.444
I do a lot of push-ups.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.614
Did they say what's
gonna happen?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.882
I get deported to Mexico
tomorrow.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.184
What?! No!

04:12.186 --> 04:13.352
Well, we tried.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.955
Is this a big joke
to you?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.757
You know what?
For once in your life,

04:18.759 --> 04:20.525
try to think about someone
besides yourself.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.794
Like who?

04:22.796 --> 04:26.064
Like Edna...
who you put in jail!

04:26.066 --> 04:29.201
Like me, your son!
This hurts me!

04:29.203 --> 04:30.402
I love her!

04:30.404 --> 04:32.471
Eli, we only have
two minutes to talk.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.007
Hold on just one second.
Dad...

04:36.309 --> 04:39.444
...you left when I was five;
you took away my father.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.913
And now you're taking Edna away.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.182
How can you do this to me twice?

04:46.919 --> 04:48.120
Fine.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.988
Get out of the way.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.495
Edna...

04:56.497 --> 04:59.131
will you marry me?

05:08.474 --> 05:11.543
What if you're not "the one"?

05:15.415 --> 05:17.516
I'm an American citizen.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.551
I'm the one.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.256
Okay.

05:24.258 --> 05:25.891
Great.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.263
Okay, I'm the wedding planner.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.698
All decisions have
to go through me.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
We have a long list
to get through

05:34.702 --> 05:36.268
and we're already,
like, so behind.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.037
Warner, baby,
please don't turn
into a groomzilla

05:39.039 --> 05:40.339
like you did
at our wedding.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.507
Groomzilla?
What are you talking about?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.109
That was my big day.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.178
Any good wedding is all about
the groom-- okay, whatever.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.779
I want to be
positive right now.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.781
Okay, let's talk theme.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.317
I'm thinking, "Havana Dusk,"

05:52.319 --> 05:55.687
"Butterfly Fantasia,"
or "Rustic Rumpus."

05:55.689 --> 05:57.622
"Rustic Rumpus."

05:57.624 --> 06:00.659
Uh, bridesmaids' color palette.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.294
Veronica, what are you
thoughts?

06:02.296 --> 06:03.662
No opinion?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.864
Great. Just another thing
for me to do!

06:06.733 --> 06:07.899
You know,
he's right, though.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.301
This wedding has
to convince the INS

06:09.303 --> 06:11.036
that your relationship with Edna
is real.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.405
It'll be real.
Watch this.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.174
Edna, where do you want
to go to eat tonight?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.242
I don't know.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.211
Where do <i>you</i> want
to eat tonight?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.345
I just asked you!

06:20.347 --> 06:21.580
Don't yell at me!

06:21.582 --> 06:24.216
See?

06:25.585 --> 06:27.152
Excuse me, Mr. Groomzilla.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.887
Yeah?

06:30.323 --> 06:35.394
Before anything, Mr. David have
to get my father blessing.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.365
Your father's bless...

06:40.367 --> 06:45.971
I'm in my 60s, and you're
somewhere between 30 and 75.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.510
Edna old-fashion.
Here.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.647
(phone ringing)

07:00.119 --> 07:01.553
<i>Hola.</i>

07:01.555 --> 07:03.855
Yes. My name is David.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.724
I want to marry
your daughter Edna.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.592
Yeah, okay.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.933
Okay, so the next thing on the
list is "Call the photographer."

07:14.935 --> 07:17.636
Oh, good, 'cause
the INS will want pictures.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.938
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm a businessman.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.641
Let me handle these
negotiations.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.243
Yeah, hello, um,
I'd like to book you

07:25.245 --> 07:27.646
to shoot a wedding
on the 28th.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.747
Mm-hmm.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.082
$3,000?!

07:31.084 --> 07:32.451
Great.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.420
Dad, you just took his price.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.722
How was that a negotiation?

07:37.724 --> 07:42.494
Ah, the negotiations start after
the wedding, when I can't pay.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.331
Okay, I can't put out
that fire right now.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.634
Uh, the next
is tablecloth swatches.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.669
Come on, people!

07:50.671 --> 07:52.304
What is wrong with him?

07:52.306 --> 07:56.341
He's on one of his
Chardonnay-fueled
rampages right now.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.945
Oh, my God,
I said sage tablecloths!

07:59.947 --> 08:02.180
This is moss!

08:02.182 --> 08:05.083
Oh, my God,
I can't even deal
with this right now.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.785
Uh, let's talk
wedding dresses.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.520
Something strapless,
right, Edna?

08:08.522 --> 08:11.156
<i>Sí.</i>
<i> (chuckles)</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:13.024
Ooh!

08:13.026 --> 08:17.496
I urge you, consider
something with straps.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.499
Lots and lots of straps.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.935
Okay, well, we'll just
leave that open.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.936
Uh, flowers?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.371
Eli, any thoughts?

08:26.373 --> 08:29.374
Oh, uh, I only know,
like, two flowers.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.010
So, uh... daisies?

08:35.314 --> 08:37.282
Daisies?

08:38.050 --> 08:40.619
(mocking laughter)

08:42.488 --> 08:44.723
Daisies...

08:44.725 --> 08:46.358
Daisies?!

08:47.159 --> 08:49.060
Get out of your house right now!

08:49.062 --> 08:51.463
I didn't do anything.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.964
That's exactly my point!

08:52.966 --> 08:54.299
Nobody's doing anything!
I'm doing everything!

08:54.301 --> 08:57.569
We started ten minutes ago.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.039
And you put yourself
in charge.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.141
If I weren't in charge,
who would be?! You?! Ha!

09:03.143 --> 09:04.976
What do you know about love?!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.812
Okay, honey,
honey, honey...

09:07.814 --> 09:10.048
Try and breathe, relax.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.150
I know. I just have
so much pressure right now.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.585
My hormones
are going crazy.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.086
Honey, take me home.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.055
I need my Fiona Apple
and my cucumber bath.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.258
All I wanted to do
was something beautiful!

09:21.894 --> 09:26.064
I afraid to tell him
I want a SpongeBob piñata.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.511
No one good is here.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.617
("Wedding March" plays)

09:49.121 --> 09:52.157
(sobbing):
Oh, God... so emotional!

09:53.960 --> 09:55.660
So beautiful!

09:58.698 --> 10:02.901
Look at these zinnias!

10:02.903 --> 10:05.136
Don't touch that!

10:05.138 --> 10:07.973
These are zinnias, Eli!

10:07.975 --> 10:10.842
Zinnias!

10:15.715 --> 10:18.183
Oh... go.

10:21.253 --> 10:25.123
Beerly de-loved...
(chuckles)

10:27.226 --> 10:31.296
Supposed to get
a two-minute laugh.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.664
Idiots.

10:32.666 --> 10:39.804
All right, uh, Camila will now
do a reading from Corinthians.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.442
"Love is patient..."

10:44.444 --> 10:45.276
Hurry up.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.313
All right, thank you.

10:49.448 --> 10:52.083
And now the couple will now
exchange vows,

10:52.085 --> 10:54.319
which they have written
themselves.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.594
Mr. David, I be your wife
here and in Mexico.

11:02.596 --> 11:06.931
We go to mall together
sometime.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.501
Good night and good luck.

11:11.003 --> 11:15.507
Edna, I promise to try
not yell at you today.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.776
I will be
a good husband

11:17.778 --> 11:20.712
as long as you
leave me alone.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.047
Also...

11:22.049 --> 11:24.382
don't eat food off
my plate in restaurants.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.617
I hate that.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.220
If you want something,
just order it yourself.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.290
Don't take advantage
of my good ordering.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.394
(sobbing):
Oh, my God...

11:37.329 --> 11:38.997
CRAWFORD:
Okay. (clears throat)

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
By the power vested in me

11:41.001 --> 11:44.536
by SoYouWannaMarryPeople.com,

11:44.538 --> 11:47.972
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.574
You may kiss the bride.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.742
It's up to you.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.212
Mwah!

11:57.249 --> 11:58.983
You know, even though
this is just

11:58.985 --> 12:00.585
to keep Edna
in the country,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.387
I still can't believe
they're going through with it.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.390
I always get
so emotional at weddings.

12:08.327 --> 12:11.496
Yeah, take it
down a notch.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.900
Stuff it, lady.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.206
Morning, Edna.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.608
Please call me "Mom."

12:25.377 --> 12:26.111
Uh...

12:26.113 --> 12:28.179
that's a little weird.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.249
Eli, I take vow
very serious.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.285
I your mother now.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.955
Dad, is she kidding?

12:36.957 --> 12:37.956
Are you kidding?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.023
No.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.925
No.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.128
Whatever.
I gotta go to work,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.763
so...
You take jacket.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.964
It's raining.
(laughs)

12:45.966 --> 12:47.365
No, I...
my office is downstairs.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.200
I don't even need
to go out of the building.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.936
Edna house, Edna rules.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.406
Okay...
Wait.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.309
I spit your hair down.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.753
Hair too messy.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.221
David, you help.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.723
(snorts, spits)

13:11.725 --> 13:13.358
Oh, my God!

13:25.070 --> 13:27.472
Hey, Paddington.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.809
Edna made me wear it.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.312
She thinks she's my mom now.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.715
Hey, you want to do
Pilates tonight?

13:38.684 --> 13:39.918
I can't.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.019
I'm grounded.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.188
I have...
What am I talking about?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.923
I am an adult,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.525
and they are living
in my house!

13:47.527 --> 13:49.994
I'm gonna give them
a piece of my mind.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.031
Da...

13:53.833 --> 13:55.433
(muttering)

13:57.036 --> 13:59.437
Ugh, the slob...

14:13.285 --> 14:14.953
(screams)

14:17.823 --> 14:19.190
DAVID:
Close your eyes,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.526
because we're not
at a point I can stop.

14:25.231 --> 14:28.032
EDNA:
Hi, Mr. Eli!

14:38.911 --> 14:40.178
I'm glad you caught us.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.512
Now we can stop hiding.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.915
Hiding?! How much have
you been doing it?

14:43.917 --> 14:46.384
A lot.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.820
What are
you wearing?

14:48.822 --> 14:51.789
Who are you supposed to be,
Billy the Yid?

14:54.927 --> 14:56.828
Edna's dressing me now.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.731
He my <i>pequeño ranchero.</i>

15:01.433 --> 15:02.734
Dad, what are you doing?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.936
This was just supposed
to be for the INS.

15:04.938 --> 15:05.937
What?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.572
She started it.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.440
I was just
sitting on the couch,

15:09.442 --> 15:10.842
minding my own
business.

15:10.844 --> 15:13.544
Then suddenly, her business
was on my business

15:13.546 --> 15:15.914
and we were in business.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.083
And business is very good.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.691
Thank you for having me over.

15:26.693 --> 15:30.295
My home has become a den
of erotic nightmares.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.763
Well, don't look at it that way.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.431
Sex gets better
when you get older,

15:33.433 --> 15:35.934
'cause you can't get
pregnant or gonorrhea.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.871
What are you talking about?

15:39.873 --> 15:41.806
Of course you can
still get gonorrhea.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.975
Oh, boy.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.313
Well, I've got
to find a way

15:48.315 --> 15:49.781
to cool their relationship.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.083
Eli, the more you try to pull
your Dad and Edna apart,

15:52.085 --> 15:54.652
you realize you're just gonna
push them closer together.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.287
Warner and I have
so many haters

15:56.289 --> 15:58.089
and they just make
our marriage stronger.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.091
I am so through
with the haters.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.326
They're so bogus.
Bogus.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.493
(laughing)

16:02.495 --> 16:04.462
What are you guys
talking about?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.831
Nobody knows or
cares who you are.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.801
Oh, honey, looks like
we have another hater.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.471
Look, we just gotta get through
this interview with the INS

16:13.473 --> 16:15.573
and everything will go back
to the way things were.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.408
When's the interview?
It's tomorrow--
and they want

16:17.410 --> 16:19.644
to talk to all of us,
so just tell the guy

16:19.646 --> 16:21.279
that Edna and my dad
are in love

16:21.281 --> 16:22.847
and had a nice wedding.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.682
A "nice wedding"?

16:24.684 --> 16:28.519
How much do you hate me
right now?

16:28.521 --> 16:31.789
So, you two are now married?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.992
Yes. We have frequent
sexual intercourse

16:33.994 --> 16:35.793
and the photos
to prove it.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.997
Sir, that's okay,
I don't need to s...

16:38.999 --> 16:40.765
Wow.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.503
Yeah, she's
surprisingly bendy.

16:46.638 --> 16:49.440
(clears throat)
I'm gonna have to interview

16:49.442 --> 16:51.442
each of you separately
to verify that

16:51.444 --> 16:53.945
this marriage is real.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.049
How old are you?

16:58.051 --> 16:59.217
Sixty-six.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.753
He 97.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.722
Did Edna
go to college?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.324
No way.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.227
I go to Arizona State.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.963
It's a waste of four years.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.833
Oh, yeah, they're very
affectionate with each other.

17:15.835 --> 17:19.137
They... make love...
all the time.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.005
(chuckles):
Oh, I know.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.707
They gave me these pictures.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.542
(gasps)

17:26.378 --> 17:31.282
It turns out you <i>can </i>
<i>still get gonorrhea.</i>

17:32.918 --> 17:34.185
So then...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.586
I wound up putting tea lights

17:35.588 --> 17:38.089
in these little paper bags,
and it worked perfectly.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.725
Again, all me.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.226
You sound like a professional.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.595
(laughing):
Thank you.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.665
How'd we do?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.501
Well, I asked you both
20 questions about each other,

17:50.503 --> 17:52.837
and the only one
you both got right was:

17:52.839 --> 17:55.606
"Who is the best Iglesias?"

17:55.608 --> 17:59.444
Julio...!
Julio...!

17:59.446 --> 18:02.613
I'm afraid this marriage
is a sham.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.082
Edna, pack your bags.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.017
No! Are you insane?

18:06.019 --> 18:08.286
The fact that we know nothing
about each other

18:08.288 --> 18:10.021
proves we're married.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.657
When's your wife's birthday?

18:15.294 --> 18:17.295
In the fall.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.796
See?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.399
Sir, at this point,
my wife and I

18:21.401 --> 18:24.869
are just staying
together for the dogs.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.538
Edna needs
to go.
No!

18:27.540 --> 18:29.941
You can't even make
your <i>fake</i> marriages work!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.275
Wait.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.944
It's okay, Eli. I go.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.779
Edna, when we first met,
there were times

18:34.781 --> 18:37.548
when I wouldn't eat just
so I'd have enough to pay you.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.485
And-and there were weeks
where your salary

18:40.487 --> 18:44.489
would eat up almost all
of my unemployment checks.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.424
But I knew one thing--

18:46.426 --> 18:49.961
I did not want
to pick up after myself.

18:51.096 --> 18:54.465
(crying): And now you're
cleaning my penthouse.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.901
Edna go back to Mexico so happy

18:56.903 --> 18:59.971
because of the time
I spent with Eli.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.739
You are my son.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.275
Oh, Edna, you are my mom.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.477
(speaking soothingly in Spanish)

19:06.479 --> 19:08.079
Okay, let's go.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.348
(phone rings)

19:11.250 --> 19:12.917
Yeah?

19:14.119 --> 19:16.187
Aw, crap.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.323
Ma'am, you're free to go.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.459
Wha...?!
Oh, my gosh!

19:21.461 --> 19:22.593
Wait, what-what happened?

19:22.595 --> 19:25.263
Eh, the government
shut down again.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.931
(laughs)

19:26.933 --> 19:29.467
Which means
my paychecks
have stopped.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.169
(laughs)

19:31.970 --> 19:34.105
Oh, but, uh...

19:34.107 --> 19:36.374
I also teach bowling.

19:38.777 --> 19:41.846
Don't you pretty much
just roll it at the pins?

19:42.514 --> 19:44.182
Yeah.

19:45.317 --> 19:48.219
(Edna and Eli laughing)

19:52.457 --> 19:54.692
Hey. You know,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.727
I really admire
what you did for Edna.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.563
Oh, yeah, it's amazing--
when you don't have kids,

19:58.565 --> 20:01.465
it really frees up time to get
involved in your maid's life.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.800
Mm.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.670
You planned a lovely wedding.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.838
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.841
You know, I, uh,
I-I went to the doctor,

20:10.843 --> 20:13.411
and I found out
that my testosterone

20:13.413 --> 20:15.880
was basically zero.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.381
So...

20:17.383 --> 20:19.650
So I got a prescription,

20:19.652 --> 20:22.353
and hopefully
I'll stop drinking appletinis

20:22.355 --> 20:25.089
and crying all the time.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.826
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.261
Picked up the wedding pictures,

20:30.263 --> 20:32.430
and great news-- I was able
to bargain the guy down

20:32.432 --> 20:33.664
to $3,000.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.900
Wow. Hey.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.768
Check these out.
Yeah.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.037
Aw.
Look at that.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.407
Oh. Aw, look
at those zinnias.
Yeah.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.775
Yeah, it turned out great.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.978
Yeah, no thanks to you.

20:47.846 --> 20:51.182
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me just...

20:51.184 --> 20:53.017
<i>Hola. Hola.</i>

20:53.019 --> 20:55.920
Hey! What are you two
so happy about?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.421
We just got divorced.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.395
I get half his money.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.497
Six dollars!

21:09.768 --> 21:13.271
(Fiona Apple's
"Criminal" playing)

21:27.085 --> 21:29.787
(knocking on door)

21:29.789 --> 21:32.556
This is <i>my</i> time right now!

21:32.558 --> 21:34.125
This is <i>my</i> time.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.329
CAMILA: Honey, are you
taking your pills?

21:42.834 --> 21:46.804
(singing along):
¶ I've been a bad, bad girl...

21:48.006 --> 21:51.942
¶ I've been careless
with a delicate man... ¶
