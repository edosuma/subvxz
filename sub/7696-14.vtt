WEBVTT

01:29.505 --> 01:30.798
It's about time.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.517
Good morning, Hill.

01:43.102 --> 01:46.647
- Oh, good morning, um...
- Fugate.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.232
Temple Fugate?

01:48.816 --> 01:51.652
I should think you'd remember
the name by now, Counselor.

01:51.819 --> 01:54.989
We've only been taking
the same train every day for...

01:55.197 --> 01:58.534
One year, seven months and 13 days.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.787
Right. The efficiency expert.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.291
Six minutes behind schedule.

02:08.377 --> 02:11.005
You seem pretty tightly wound
this morning, Fugate.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.549
I have an important court hearing today.

02:13.674 --> 02:16.927
There's been a $20 million judgment
against my company.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.846
My attorney has appealed.

02:18.929 --> 02:20.139
But if we lose,

02:20.222 --> 02:22.350
it's the end of everything.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.810
Temple, let me give you some advice.

02:25.102 --> 02:27.897
I'm a lawyer.
Trust me, I know these things.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.192
If that judge sees you
looking as tense and haggard

02:31.275 --> 02:32.485
as you are â€œOW,

02:32.610 --> 02:34.362
he'll think you were up to something.

02:34.820 --> 02:35.821
Loosen up.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.115
Do something to relax
before you go into court.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.618
Get out of your routine
for a few minutes.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.370
Do you take a coffee break?

02:42.536 --> 02:44.080
Of course. Every day,

02:44.246 --> 02:45.831
at 3:00 on the dot.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.250
Then take it at 3:15.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.712
But... My schedule.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.256
Forget your schedule for one day.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.177
Believe me,
it will make a new man out of you.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.526
I needed those five minutes ago.

03:13.859 --> 03:15.069
I'm sorry, sir, but...

03:15.194 --> 03:16.779
Thirty-seven pages?

03:16.904 --> 03:20.616
That would take a copier
exactly one minute and 49 seconds.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.452
One more delay like this
and you're fired.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.455
Your coffee, sir.
And those court documents you requested.

03:28.165 --> 03:31.043
<i>Take your coffee break
at 3:15.</i>

03:32.253 --> 03:33.879
<i>And get out of the office.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.465
Put that in a thermos, Ms. Perkins.

04:04.034 --> 04:05.035
Aah!

04:07.037 --> 04:09.290
You little brats!

04:15.588 --> 04:17.381
No! No!

04:17.631 --> 04:19.216
Don't do this to me!

04:21.218 --> 04:23.179
My lawyer needs those papers.

04:38.819 --> 04:40.863
Due to his failure to appear,

04:40.988 --> 04:43.741
this court finds your client in default.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.202
Summary judgment against him stands,

04:46.577 --> 04:47.870
at $20 million.

04:49.413 --> 04:52.082
No! You can't! I'll be ruined!

04:52.333 --> 04:56.003
Then perhaps this will teach you
to be on time for a change.

05:41.715 --> 05:45.177
Are you quite sure you won't stop
for breakfast, Master Bruce?

05:45.511 --> 05:47.847
The meals they serve
at these fundraisers...

05:47.972 --> 05:49.765
Mmm, ghastly.

05:49.890 --> 05:52.810
Alfred, I'm sure Mayor Hill
will put out a good spread.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.979
He knows you don't kick off
a reelection campaign

05:55.062 --> 05:56.397
by poisoning your supporters.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.445
Really? If he were
in a hurry to get to the food,

06:03.529 --> 06:05.698
he'd be ahead of us
instead of behind us.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.502
I take it taxi drivers
are no longer required

06:18.586 --> 06:20.462
to obey traffic signals.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.047
Climb off it, geezer.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.424
You had the red.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.717
It's nobody's fault.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.051
Look.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.556
The traffic signals are malfunctioning.

06:33.475 --> 06:34.518
What the devil?

06:35.185 --> 06:36.395
That is rude!

06:36.478 --> 06:37.730
It's the same thing all the time.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.482
I'll sue you.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.784
There's the foul-up.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.369
Mayor Over-the-Hill.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.622
Nothing works right
in this city no more.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.375
I fear this does not bode well
for his campaign.

06:59.126 --> 07:00.127
No-

07:00.252 --> 07:01.295
No, it doesn't.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.464
And that may be exactly the point.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.987
Another piece of outlandish graffiti?

07:27.488 --> 07:30.074
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

07:47.424 --> 07:48.592
Hold it!

07:48.884 --> 07:50.511
Well, well.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.137
The Batman.

07:52.304 --> 07:54.348
It's about time you showed up.

07:54.723 --> 07:58.227
I suppose you want to know
why I've brought downtown Gotham

07:58.352 --> 08:00.437
to a standstill, Batman. Hmm?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.398
Well, let's just say

08:02.481 --> 08:07.361
it's because I'm a civic-minded citizen
with a lot of time on his hands.

08:19.915 --> 08:21.834
I want some answers, wise guy.

08:23.752 --> 08:24.753
Talk!

08:24.920 --> 08:25.921
A pity.

08:26.046 --> 08:27.965
I don't know what to tell you, Batman.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.093
Except, perhaps that the 9:15

08:31.176 --> 08:33.971
is always six minutes early.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.494
If the creep with the clocks
did sabotage the entire traffic system,

08:57.953 --> 08:59.913
he had to have come here to do it.

09:00.789 --> 09:01.790
Wait here.

09:07.796 --> 09:08.797
My pleasure.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.134
This is one of the finest back alleys
in all of Gotham.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.877
What kind of saboteur

09:46.960 --> 09:50.506
uses a $6,000 Metronex
to trigger a time bomb?

09:50.631 --> 09:53.008
A saboteur with too much money?

09:53.675 --> 09:56.011
Most jewelry stores
register the serial numbers

09:56.095 --> 09:57.554
of the Metronexes they sell.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.935
Let's see what the police database
turns up.

10:05.395 --> 10:08.857
"Temple Fugate. 362 Brayfogle."

10:09.358 --> 10:10.567
Let's go, Alfred.

10:15.280 --> 10:19.201
It appears Mr. Fugate's neighborhood
has seen better days.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.500
What is it about
that particular clock tower?

11:08.750 --> 11:11.420
He's got more data on it
than anything else in the city.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.463
There's been a slight blackout.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.508
Just one city block,
between Schiff and Robinson,

11:16.592 --> 11:18.010
west of Molldorf.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.013
The location
of Gotham Mutual's main branch.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.683
No doubt some malefactors
blacked out the bank,

11:24.975 --> 11:26.935
to disable the locks on the vault.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.813
Yes, the time locks.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.981
- Fugate.
- Fugate.

12:10.812 --> 12:13.523
<i>Sorry I couldn't be
with you in person, Batman.</i>

12:13.649 --> 12:15.359
<i>But, I've got a train to catch.</i>

12:15.442 --> 12:18.570
<i>This box contains
a high-speed vacuum pump.</i>

12:18.695 --> 12:21.531
<i>I know you've got
all kinds of gas masks.</i>

12:21.698 --> 12:23.700
<i>So, I'm putting you out of my misery</i>

12:23.784 --> 12:27.120
<i>by simply removing
all the oxygen from the room.</i>

12:30.958 --> 12:32.876
<i>The process will take 15 minutes,</i>

12:33.210 --> 12:35.003
<i>which is exactly 17 minutes less</i>

12:35.087 --> 12:36.588
<i>than the time it would take you</i>

12:36.672 --> 12:39.967
<i>to burn through the door
with that oxyacetylene torch of yours.</i>

12:41.301 --> 12:44.721
<i>Oh, and, I don't recommend
trying to open the pump's housing.</i>

12:44.930 --> 12:47.724
<i>It's rigged
with a vibration-sensitive explosive.</i>

12:47.975 --> 12:50.352
<i>Of course,
if you want to get blown to bits,</i>

12:50.602 --> 12:52.229
<i>that's fine with me.</i>

12:52.354 --> 12:55.857
<i>Either way, it's time to say
adieu, Batman.</i>

13:32.978 --> 13:35.105
This magnificent station,

13:35.230 --> 13:39.026
home of the world's
first fully-automated subway line,

13:39.151 --> 13:41.778
is the fulfillment of my pledge to you,

13:43.030 --> 13:46.867
to make our subways safer
and more efficient.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.954
And so, I declare Gotham Central Station

13:51.079 --> 13:52.998
officially open.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.967
Let the first train arrive!

14:15.312 --> 14:16.938
Where is it?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.506
What an embarrassment.

14:44.132 --> 14:47.719
I wanted that train here
at 2:30 on the dot!

14:48.136 --> 14:50.722
<i>So, is this what you want?</i>

14:50.847 --> 14:53.683
<i>A mayor who can't
even get a single subway train</i>

14:53.767 --> 14:54.976
<i>to arrive on time?</i>

15:02.150 --> 15:03.860
<i>Clear the platform, please.</i>

15:04.111 --> 15:07.489
<i>Here comes some more
of our mayor's incompetence.</i>

15:46.695 --> 15:49.239
Only minor injuries. Thank God.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.199
Hill! Where's Hill?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.954
<i>And in the wake of the subway accident,</i>

16:38.038 --> 16:39.039
<i>this grim news,</i>

16:39.164 --> 16:41.249
<i>Mayor Hamilton Hill has vanished.</i>

16:41.625 --> 16:43.877
<i>The police have no leads
to his whereabouts</i>

16:44.002 --> 16:45.837
<i>and they fear
he may have been kidnapped.</i>

16:57.891 --> 16:59.476
Comfortable, Hill?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.353
Well, you won't be for long.

17:01.686 --> 17:06.149
At 3:15 on the dot,
those hands will come together,

17:06.316 --> 17:08.443
and you'll be crushed like an insect.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.779
3:15, Hi...

17:10.987 --> 17:14.115
Does that time hold any meaning for you?

17:14.241 --> 17:16.117
I don't know what you're talking about!

17:16.368 --> 17:20.622
You told me
to take my coffee break at 3:15.

17:20.997 --> 17:23.500
- What?
- You don't remember?

17:23.667 --> 17:24.960
My court date?

17:27.295 --> 17:28.922
Oh, my Lord!

17:29.005 --> 17:30.173
The lawsuit!

17:30.590 --> 17:33.969
Fugate, I swear,
I was only trying to help.

17:34.177 --> 17:35.220
Don't hand me that.

17:35.428 --> 17:36.555
You did it on purpose.

17:36.846 --> 17:40.600
The plaintiffs were represented
by your law firm, Mr. Mayor.

17:43.436 --> 17:46.398
But I had nothing to do
with that case, Fugate.

17:46.898 --> 17:47.941
Liar!

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
Not that it matters anymore,

17:50.193 --> 17:54.864
now that you have an appointment
to keep at 3:15 precisely,

17:54.948 --> 17:56.950
with the grim reaper!

18:04.332 --> 18:07.043
I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate.

18:07.168 --> 18:09.045
Don't count on it, Batman.

18:09.170 --> 18:12.048
When it comes to clocks, I am king.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.383
<i>En garde!</i>

18:16.428 --> 18:17.429
Huh?

18:18.013 --> 18:19.014
Whoa!

18:41.328 --> 18:42.537
Give it up, Fugate.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.581
Hill committed no crime against you.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.166
He did worse.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.251
He made me late!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.582
I could do this all day, Batman,

19:27.707 --> 19:29.000
but your time is up.

19:50.563 --> 19:52.190
I've studied
news footage of you.

19:52.273 --> 19:53.358
And I know that it takes you

19:53.441 --> 19:56.903
exactly 1/20 of a second
to throw a punch.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.613
Very clever.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.533
But it only takes me 1/30 of a second

20:01.825 --> 20:03.326
to do this.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.130
Huh?

20:41.740 --> 20:42.907
Fugate!

20:43.032 --> 20:44.492
You can't escape!

20:44.784 --> 20:47.162
<i>Au contraire,</i> Batman.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.999
You of all people should know

20:51.791 --> 20:53.918
there's always a way out.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.760
Fugate!

21:30.330 --> 21:32.916
Well, he won't be doing
any more campaigning for a few days.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.335
But at least the Mayor is safe.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.837
No trace
of this Clock King, though.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.548
How could anyone survive
a wreck like this?

21:40.757 --> 21:42.926
If I could, he could.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.052
Then,

21:44.511 --> 21:46.179
you think we'll hear from him again?

21:46.387 --> 21:48.139
I wouldn't be surprised, Commissioner.

21:48.264 --> 21:49.265
In fact,

21:49.349 --> 21:51.768
I'd say, it's only a matter of time.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.801
English - SDH
