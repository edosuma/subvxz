[suspenseful music]

00:09.884 --> 00:10.969
* *

00:11.011 --> 00:12.345
- Here at CrimeCon
in Las Vegas,

00:12.387 --> 00:14.681
a tragic end
to the life of Dahlia Stone.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.767
She was the only known survivor
of the Westside Ripper.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.102
[people screaming]

00:19.144 --> 00:21.187
Police sources reveal
that it appears

00:21.229 --> 00:22.564
she took her own life.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.773
[people screaming]

00:23.815 --> 00:24.899
- I mean, just...splat.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.443
[people screaming]

00:26.484 --> 00:28.903
- And we will be live casting
a special memorial tribute

00:28.945 --> 00:31.740
to Dahlia Stone
in Ballroom A at 9:00 a.m.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.450
- We'll have more
on this story later tonight.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.743
- Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.828
I told you he killed her.
- We don't know that.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.079
- OK, maybe we should just
talk to the cops.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.080
We were standing right there.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.874
We look so suspicious.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.834
- You want me to talk to
the cops about a second body?

00:42.876 --> 00:43.918
How's that gonna look?

00:43.960 --> 00:46.087
- Uh, we just ran away.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.672
- Yeah, everybody ran.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.883
Nobody likes talking
to the cops ever.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.176
Ruby and Carlos ran.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.428
They don't know
a fucking serial killer.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.388
We're gonna be fine.
- Oh, really, really?

00:55.430 --> 00:56.806
Am I just overreacting
about the body

00:56.848 --> 00:58.641
that just fell
straight from the sky?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.727
Matt's probably halfway
to Mexico by now

01:00.769 --> 01:03.063
when we're still standing here
like a bunch of fucking chumps.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.272
We have to leave.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.648
Start packing.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.067
[knock at door]

01:07.108 --> 01:13.782
* *

01:14.783 --> 01:16.117
This is it. This is it.
- No, no.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.494
- This is the cops.
We're going to jail.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.661
- Shh. Calm down. Calm down.
- Our lives are over.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.622
[knock at door]

01:20.663 --> 01:24.334
* *

01:24.376 --> 01:26.336
[forceful knocking]

01:26.378 --> 01:33.510
* *

01:36.763 --> 01:40.934
- I know what you're thinking,
but good news.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.560
It wasn't me.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.940
- OK, well, do you know
what happened?

01:46.981 --> 01:48.024
- Yeah.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.276
All right, so...

01:50.318 --> 01:52.529
I go up to the bar, right,
to confront her,

01:52.570 --> 01:54.906
and she denies it,
but she freaks.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.784
Like, I think she's, like,
a total sociopath.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.119
But that's it.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.954
I leave, and...

02:00.995 --> 02:02.455
[sucks teeth]

02:02.497 --> 02:05.250
[whistles]
Bam.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.918
- You were up there
with her on the roof?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.211
- Relax, all right?

02:08.253 --> 02:10.797
There was one camera,
blind spots everywhere.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.424
We're totally safe.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.717
Justice is served,

02:13.758 --> 02:15.677
and I didn't even need
to get my hands dirty.

02:15.719 --> 02:19.389
- So you're saying she just
confessed and then jumped?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.766
- Well, she didn't
actually confess,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.852
you know, but she knew
she'd been exposed.

02:23.893 --> 02:27.313
Maybe she just...
couldn't handle it.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.483
- Or--or maybe she realized

02:30.525 --> 02:32.569
that she was standing in front
of the Westside Ripper

02:32.610 --> 02:34.195
who was gonna finish the job,

02:34.237 --> 02:35.572
so you threw her the fuck over.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.198
- OK, all right, let's--
let's--let's--

02:37.240 --> 02:39.659
everybody stay calm, and we'll
try to figure out next steps.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.703
- Yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

02:41.745 --> 02:48.501
* *

02:48.543 --> 02:50.712
- You guys going somewhere?

02:50.754 --> 02:53.048
- Uh, yeah.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.716
We're not staying here
after everything that happened.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.927
- Well, actually,
we are gonna stay right here,

02:57.969 --> 03:00.722
exactly as we planned,
until the end of CrimeCon.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.848
You got it?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.142
We change hotels,
flights, anything,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.393
that's a red flag.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.895
- So you want us
to stay inside for two days?

03:06.936 --> 03:09.522
- [laughs] No, Nathan, no,
that would be even weirder.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.025
Just get out there
like a normal person.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.404
* *

03:16.446 --> 03:18.573
- He is so full of shit.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.866
There's no way
he didn't push her.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.159
- I don't know.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.952
I mean, it's--it's--
it makes too much trouble.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.372
All he wants to do
is to protect the brand,

03:25.413 --> 03:27.207
and now he's got
this shit show.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.209
- We had one rule:
no more killing.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.251
He broke it.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.461
It was insane that we thought

03:31.503 --> 03:33.380
we could control
that fucking psychopath.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.424
I'm gonna spend
my last night of freedom

03:36.466 --> 03:38.802
at home in my own bed,

03:38.843 --> 03:40.887
and then tomorrow
we are gonna go to the cops,

03:40.929 --> 03:43.223
and we're gonna--
- We're not going anywhere.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.975
* *

03:46.017 --> 03:48.895
You asked me to do this
together, remember?

03:48.937 --> 03:51.398
Together.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.067
And I did.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.527
I got no place to hide.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.279
I'm his fucking alibi.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.073
But now things
are getting real,

04:00.115 --> 04:01.950
you don't get to get all wobbly
and give up

04:01.991 --> 04:03.326
and throw us to the wolves,

04:03.368 --> 04:04.744
because maybe--
maybe that girl did jump.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.746
Maybe he's telling the truth.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.332
If we're gonna destroy
our life, our family's lives,

04:09.374 --> 04:11.334
we better be fucking sure,
and we're not.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.795
So unpack your stuff.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.338
We're staying.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.090
- Hmm.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.217
OK, fine.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.969
But he pushed her,

04:21.011 --> 04:24.055
which means this whole fucking
game is about to be over.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.390
You'll see.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.143
[door slams]

04:28.184 --> 04:32.439
* *

04:32.480 --> 04:36.901
[indistinct chatter]

04:36.943 --> 04:38.028
[tense music]

04:38.069 --> 04:40.363
- Signed copies of "Not Today,"
folks.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.949
Signed copies of "Not Today."

04:42.991 --> 04:46.161
* *

04:46.202 --> 04:47.370
- Come on over.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.539
Westside Ripper merch
right over here.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.125
Hey, we got signed copies
of "Not Today," folks.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.168
Come on over.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.294
This is the place to do it.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.046
Signed copies of "Not Today."

04:56.087 --> 05:00.342
Real Westside Ripper merch,
signed copies.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.634
You looking
for something special?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.553
- People buy this...

05:03.595 --> 05:05.388
Westside Ripper merch?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.890
- [laughs]
Yeah, he's my best seller.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.517
Uh, what do you want,
a T-shirt, a calendar,

05:09.559 --> 05:10.894
coloring book right here?

05:10.935 --> 05:11.936
I got everything.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.063
You read "Not Today"?

05:13.104 --> 05:14.397
- [sucks teeth]
Wow.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.982
- This thing's selling
like hotcakes

05:16.024 --> 05:17.192
since she peaced out.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.735
The Westside Ripper,

05:18.777 --> 05:21.654
he's putting my son
through college.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.448
[laughs]

05:23.490 --> 05:24.532
- That's great.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.076
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yeah.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.535
Can I get you something?
- Yeah, I'll take--

05:27.577 --> 05:29.120
- You're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.622
Best book you ever read.

05:35.251 --> 05:38.213
[uneasy music]

05:38.254 --> 05:43.009
* *

05:43.051 --> 05:46.221
- [breathing heavily]

05:46.262 --> 05:48.556
* *

05:48.598 --> 05:50.475
- [sighs]
- You know what?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.394
You're stressing me out.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.145
I need a drink.

05:54.187 --> 05:59.109
* *

05:59.150 --> 06:01.111
- Well, wait up.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.614
[indistinct chatter]

06:04.656 --> 06:08.284
* *

06:08.326 --> 06:10.620
- What's your favorite murder?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.416
- Uh...
[clears throat]

06:14.457 --> 06:16.251
You know, I, um--

06:16.292 --> 06:18.336
I love the classics:

06:18.378 --> 06:21.965
Bundy, Gacy, Leopold and Loeb.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.341
- Love those guys.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.301
- You do?
- Yeah.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.845
- What about you?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.931
- I can't go past my guy here,
the Westside Ripper.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.057
- Yeah?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.267
- All the other
serial killers today,

06:32.308 --> 06:34.936
they have no flair, no style.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.855
Even the Golden State Killer
turned out to be

06:36.896 --> 06:38.606
a mumbly old fuck
in a wheelchair.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.817
- Oh, my God,
his apology at trial?

06:40.859 --> 06:43.403
"Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry." Please.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.612
- Exactly.
You got caught, dude.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.198
Just own it.
- Yeah.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.410
- But the Westside Ripper,
he's got game.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.954
He's making the cops
look stupid.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.707
And I don't believe this chick
for one second.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.168
The Westside Ripper
would never be so sloppy

06:58.209 --> 07:00.295
to leave behind a survivor.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.255
I think she's full of shit
and she made the whole thing up

07:02.297 --> 07:03.840
and that is why she jumped.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.925
- Yeah.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.640
[suspenseful music]

07:12.682 --> 07:15.894
* *

07:15.935 --> 07:17.604
Hey...

07:17.645 --> 07:20.607
* *

07:20.648 --> 07:22.650
You want to have
a drink with me?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.195
- Here we go!
- Oh, boy.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.780
- Yes!
- Oh-ho-ho!

07:26.821 --> 07:28.114
- Shot, shot, shot, shot...

07:28.156 --> 07:29.866
both: Shot, shot, shot,
shot, shot, shot.

07:29.908 --> 07:33.328
- You guys, no,
we're not gonna do...that.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.829
- Come on.
You're in your third trimester.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.664
Just pretend you're French
or something.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.124
- Do whatever you want.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.001
We are in Vegas.
- All right, fine.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.419
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.589
OK, I think that after
the whole dead body incident,

07:44.631 --> 07:47.050
we could all do
with a little pick-me-up.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.260
One for you.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.055
[dance music playing]

07:52.097 --> 07:53.348
* *

07:53.390 --> 07:55.350
And one for me.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.519
And one for you.
- I don't--

07:57.560 --> 07:59.729
- Oh, there we go, perfect.
OK.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.148
- You want to spit it out?
I mean, we're in Vegas.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.566
* *

08:03.608 --> 08:04.859
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

08:04.901 --> 08:06.111
- Whoo!
- Salud.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.987
- Salud.
- Yes.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.322
Mmm. And--

08:09.364 --> 08:11.783
- Oh, my God, I have
missed you so much.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.243
- And now...
- [exhales forcefully]

08:13.284 --> 08:14.869
- The fun begins.
- What does that mean?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.204
We're having a great time.
- That means we're dancing.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.539
- Where are we go--
- Come on, come on, come on.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.499
- Hey, come on, come on,
come on.

08:19.541 --> 08:26.673
* *

08:35.223 --> 08:37.225
- So is this is your first time
at CrimeCon?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.436
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.812
But you know what?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.188
I kind of love it.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
- So you make content?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.569
* *

08:47.610 --> 08:49.446
- I do.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.032
I do make content.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.283
- What kind?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.492
- You know, the usual kind--

08:54.534 --> 08:56.661
uh, abduction, murder.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.872
- Well, I am a TV writer.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.165
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.209
I'm actually here
researching my next big thing.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.129
- Have you written
anything I might have seen?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.840

20:57.173 --> 20:59.426
- Ted Bundy bottle opener!

20:59.467 --> 21:01.678
Get your Ted Bundy
bottle opener.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.805
Ted Bundy bottle opener.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.432
- I'll take the Killer Jam.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.809
- Thank you.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.853
- Mom, look.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.439
It says the Westside Ripper's
here,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.065
live in Ballroom D.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.026
- What?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.987
[suspenseful music]

21:19.029 --> 21:20.905
* *

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
- [scoffs]

21:31.750 --> 21:34.044
There's no way
the Westside Ripper's in here.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.670
This is bullshit.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.757
[microphone feedback squeals]

21:38.798 --> 21:40.759
- Hello, and welcome
to the second episode

21:40.800 --> 21:43.553
of our exciting new
true crime podcast,

21:43.595 --> 21:45.472
"Based on a True Story."

21:45.513 --> 21:48.516
I'm your host,
the Westside Ripper.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.143
[people murmuring]

21:50.185 --> 21:52.145
And I've spent
the last few days here

21:52.187 --> 21:53.980
in my element at CrimeCon.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.816
And to celebrate, last night,

21:56.858 --> 21:59.361
I killed Dahlia Stone.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.612
[people gasping]
- Oh, my God.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.240
- That was no accident,
no suicide.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.034
If you want to know more,

22:06.076 --> 22:08.870
stick around
after the break.

22:10.372 --> 22:15.502
- * I will remember you *

22:15.543 --> 22:16.836
[phone chimes]

22:16.878 --> 22:21.257
* Will you remember me *

22:21.299 --> 22:23.551
[phone chimes]

22:23.593 --> 22:27.305
[phones chiming]
* Don't let your life *

22:27.347 --> 22:30.266
* Pass you by *

22:30.308 --> 22:32.268
[people murmuring]

22:32.310 --> 22:34.229
* Weep not for *

22:34.270 --> 22:35.730
- Hey, what's going on?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.232
- * The memories *

22:37.273 --> 22:38.692
- The Westside Ripper's here?

22:38.733 --> 22:40.276
- Oh, my--we got to go.
- What?

22:40.318 --> 22:41.403
- Shit.
- Come, come.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.738
- * Remember the good times *

22:44.322 --> 22:46.449
[phone buzzing]

22:46.491 --> 22:48.118
- It's Ruby.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.202
Hi.

22:49.244 --> 22:50.954
- Oh, my God, Ava,
where are you?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.831
- Uh, the buffet.
Where else?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.749
- OK, well,
get down to Ballroom D.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.209
The Westside Ripper is here.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.420
[tense music]

22:58.461 --> 22:59.838
- What?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.464
- Yeah, he's talking
about how he killed

23:01.506 --> 23:03.883
Dahlia Stone last night.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.011
- Uh, OK, yeah, we're--
we're--we're on our way.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.721
* *

23:07.762 --> 23:09.097
What the fuck?

23:13.727 --> 23:16.646
[suspenseful music]

23:16.688 --> 23:19.607
* *

23:19.649 --> 23:21.693
[indistinct chatter]

23:21.735 --> 23:24.112
- This can't be for--

23:24.154 --> 23:25.321
this must be
something different.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.364
- OK.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.617
* *

23:29.659 --> 23:30.869
- Oh, my God.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.328
- What the fuck is he doing?

23:32.370 --> 23:33.705
- I--

23:34.831 --> 23:37.000
- I never met Dahlia Stone.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.585
I never attacked her.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.045
And I certainly
never ran away from her

23:40.086 --> 23:41.838
holding my balls.
[laughter]

23:41.880 --> 23:43.590
I have a long and proud record

23:43.631 --> 23:45.800
of leaving no survivors
behind.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.093
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.136
- So I followed her up to...

23:48.178 --> 23:49.554
- Oh, my God.
- This is insane.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.181
- Yeah.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.392
- Have you heard of this,
"Based on a True Story"?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.852
- No.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.604
- She said she'd tell
the world the truth:

23:57.645 --> 23:59.397
she made it all up.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.649
But I decided to throw her
over the railing instead.

24:01.691 --> 24:02.692
[people gasp]

24:02.734 --> 24:04.736
- [mouthing words]

24:04.778 --> 24:07.572
[people murmuring]

24:07.614 --> 24:08.948
- Oh, and on the rooftop,

24:08.990 --> 24:11.242
she was wearing
a star pendant.

24:11.284 --> 24:15.330
I'm sure my friends
at the LVPD will confirm.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.331
- [whispering] We got to go

24:16.373 --> 24:17.374
talk to Matt.
- OK.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.541
- [normally]
We'll be right back, OK?

24:18.583 --> 24:19.584
- Yeah, yeah.
See you in a bit.

24:19.626 --> 24:25.507
* *

24:25.548 --> 24:26.591
- Oh.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.468
Ava!

24:28.510 --> 24:34.641
* *

24:34.683 --> 24:35.934
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Matt--

24:35.975 --> 24:37.852
- Shh, be cool.
Be cool, all right?

24:41.856 --> 24:44.234
- Hey, you said
you didn't do it.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.944
- Yeah, and I didn't.
I didn't do it.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.738
How many times?
I didn't do it.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.408
But I did have
a light bulb moment.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.827
Nobody gives a shit about
cold cases anymore, right?

24:53.868 --> 24:56.371
It's too old-school,
too "Serial."

24:56.413 --> 25:00.750
Our fans, they want
fresh content, new murders.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.877
And the newer, the better.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.671
- OK, that's great,
but we had an agreement.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.630
You said--
- I know we had

25:05.672 --> 25:06.715
an agreement, all right,

25:06.756 --> 25:07.966
but that doesn't mean--
- Shh.

25:08.008 --> 25:11.052
- That doesn't mean
that we can't, you know,

25:11.094 --> 25:13.263
claim a few of these
as our own.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.806
[indistinct chatter]

25:14.848 --> 25:16.516
I mean, look at this buzz.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.644
[indistinct chatter]

25:19.686 --> 25:21.938
These jackals,
they are loving it.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.565
There is an entire

25:23.606 --> 25:25.650
Westside Ripper industry
out there,

25:25.692 --> 25:28.403
people making money
hand over fist

25:28.445 --> 25:30.530
on my hard work.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.699
What do we get?
Nothing.

25:32.741 --> 25:35.493
113 fucking downloads.

25:35.535 --> 25:38.413
* *

25:38.455 --> 25:40.790
We've got to change it up.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.751
This is changing it up.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.671
So get on board,

25:46.713 --> 25:49.007
'cause this dream,

25:49.049 --> 25:51.926
this dream we had together,

25:51.968 --> 25:55.513
it's happening right now.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.182
* *

25:57.223 --> 25:59.017
- Matt, come back.
- I'll see you inside.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.643
- Come--

26:00.685 --> 26:07.817
* *

26:09.069 --> 26:11.279
Wow, this is
a lot of people, huh?

26:11.321 --> 26:12.906
- Yeah.

26:12.947 --> 26:20.080
* *

26:22.290 --> 26:25.377
- You know...

26:25.418 --> 26:28.421
maybe that girl did jump.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.216
- Totally possible.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.219
- Who's to really say
who jumped or didn't jump?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.887
We can't...
- Absolutely.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.848
- Say.
- No, we can't.

26:38.890 --> 26:42.060
- * From the cradle bars
comes a beckoning voice *

26:42.102 --> 26:44.187
* It sends you spinning *

26:44.229 --> 26:46.398
* You have no choice *

26:46.439 --> 26:53.446
* *

26:53.488 --> 26:54.823
- More murders to come.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.950
New podcasts every Friday.
