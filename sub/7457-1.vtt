00:24.785 --> 00:29.011
I know that most people decorate
tombs on the Day of the Dead,

00:29.401 --> 00:32.287
but... my mother
loved Christmas.

00:33.377 --> 00:40.410
Therefore, independently
of the weather, every Christmas, I go to
cemetery to decorate his grave.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.503
Can people freeze
if they stay here?

00:56.543 --> 01:00.290
-You're not from around here?
-I left a long time ago

01:04.465 --> 01:06.254
Merry Christmas!

01:06.294 --> 01:09.101
Merry Christmas!

01:13.526 --> 01:17.223
If you believe, small miracles
can change your life.

01:18.402 --> 01:25.325
A child who laughs, the car that needs
a repair, even a pair of shoes.

01:26.374 --> 01:29.940
Nor did I know that I needed a
miracle, until it happened.

01:30.959 --> 01:34.326
It was about fifteen years ago

01:35.285 --> 01:38.751
What have I done to
deserve a beautiful girl?

01:39.610 --> 01:43.247
She is amazing, fifty times
more intelligent than me.

01:44.455 --> 01:46.384
Talented, clean your room.

01:47.043 --> 01:49.990
It is excellent in the School.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.615
So maybe you will not go
to my concert tonight?

01:56.024 --> 01:58.272
- This time I will go.
- Maybe I should not go.

01:58.471 --> 02:01.548
-What are you talking about?
-I feel a little dizzy.

02:02.827 --> 02:05.974
You are very well,
sleep a little more.

02:07.722 --> 02:10.779
Dad, when you come
tonight, bring me flowers.

02:12.188 --> 02:13.177
You can bet.

02:19.251 --> 02:21.398
-Robert, do you want to drink your coffee?
-No, I'm late.

02:22.537 --> 02:24.236
- Hey, guess what.
-What?

02:24.326 --> 02:26.833
Remember that Victorian mansion?

02:27.083 --> 02:29.640
The mansion you were
drooling for having?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.927
- As I remember you were the one who drooled!
-On sale.

02:34.615 --> 02:37.742
- It's a great commitment!
- Let's fly higher

02:40.020 --> 02:44.735
- You're coming tonight, right?
- Everyone puts me to the test today!

02:45.205 --> 02:48.072
Buy some roses and
please do not be late.

02:48.391 --> 02:52.238
I have clients from the agricultural
sector who are trying to keep the tubes

02:52.278 --> 02:54.795
of irrigation. It's one thing,
I'm leaving the job now.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.413
You talked to the farmers. true?

02:57.083 --> 02:59.430
Everyone in the company is involved.
Tom prepares documents, Noggets

03:00.210 --> 03:03.336
He does not stop talking with men on his
tractors like removers through his short nose.

03:03.376 --> 03:05.634
They are experienced partners,
they always get what they want.

03:05.674 --> 03:08.621
I am better at what I do.
And I work hard.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.148
Gwen prepared this curriculum for you.

03:12.278 --> 03:15.235
We need you again to teach
a course on Madson Hill.

03:16.873 --> 03:19.780
I think Lilly is used
to staying at home?

03:20.449 --> 03:22.937
Yes! But we agreed to do it...

03:23.906 --> 03:26.244
I think we talk about it.

03:33.656 --> 03:36.134
- See you at night.
- Very good

04:13.207 --> 04:15.744
Is not my style!

04:29.760 --> 04:30.180
I caught her

04:30.929 --> 04:32.437
- Run Run!
- Have you heard, come on!

04:33.117 --> 04:35.544
All right, I'm ready. Come on, strip

04:40.190 --> 04:40.979
I am so sorry!

04:42.058 --> 04:44.645
You hit my antenna, did not you
see me before throwing the ball?

04:44.805 --> 04:47.003
I was just trying to teach
my son how to throw

04:48.112 --> 04:52.637
Think it is so. Whatever.

04:55.155 --> 04:57.572
I'd better take my coffee
before going to school.

04:58.441 --> 05:00.030
- Crepes?
- Oh, boy, it's okay.

05:03.506 --> 05:05.384
Come on mom, why
are you delaying?

05:06.363 --> 05:08.112
I'm going, I'm going!

05:12.817 --> 05:14.965
Well, check out the classifieds!

05:17.163 --> 05:20.080
- Here it is.
- Bom!

05:21.318 --> 05:23.456
- Not yet.

05:24.305 --> 05:26.054
Let me see.

05:27.123 --> 05:30.529
If you get a job as a
cook you will be rich.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.527
Thank you!

05:33.196 --> 05:34.935
Here, mom, I found it, I found it!

05:34.975 --> 05:38.072
We are not going to have puppies.
No way!

05:40.130 --> 05:42.597
Honey, you have more butter?

05:42.637 --> 05:47.332
Why not! You did not
have a dog as a child?

05:47.812 --> 05:50.040
- That's a good argument!
- Help.

05:50.389 --> 05:53.906
I'll take care of him.
No, we do not have much money.

05:53.946 --> 05:57.103
- It's the last thing we need.
- I need a puppy.

05:57.662 --> 06:01.918
- Why can not I have a puppy?
- Why?

06:03.117 --> 06:04.575
Wait a minute!

06:04.925 --> 06:06.283
I do not know dear!

06:08.821 --> 06:10.729
Well, remember my
friend's goldfish?

06:13.127 --> 06:15.924
Two weeks ago they are
floating around the belly.

06:17.053 --> 06:18.881
I did not want to bury him.

06:21.158 --> 06:22.817
Have you finished all your homework?

06:24.006 --> 06:26.863
- The majority?
- The teacher taught them to only do the majority?

06:28.072 --> 06:30.469
- Yes!
- Yes, go to school!

06:34.275 --> 06:36.743
This sucks!

06:39.081 --> 06:43.936
- Do not you want to talk about the dog at least?
- Oh, dear, it's so irresponsible.

06:44.815 --> 06:47.632
- It's just a boy.
- Children have to be responsible.

06:48.921 --> 06:52.587
Your mother says that the dog was
exactly the cure for you
irresponsibility, okay?

06:54.095 --> 06:56.004
-My mother said that?
-Yes.

07:07.033 --> 07:09.800
- Any news from the doctor?
- Nothing new.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.436
So... respect?

07:13.996 --> 07:15.284
Regarding what?

07:16.513 --> 07:18.421
To the puppies?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.128
This is a dirty trick.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.195
- It was not.
- It's not fun

07:24.735 --> 07:26.803
-We'll talk later!
-Bye

07:27.932 --> 07:29.420
I love you!

07:42.227 --> 07:47.902
<i>Andrews Mechanics Workshop</i>

07:52.087 --> 07:53.946
- Hi boss.
- How are you, Carl.

07:54.845 --> 07:57.013
I was thinking about placing a

07:57.052 --> 07:59.240
cappuccino machine, maybe that
will attract more customers

07:59.280 --> 08:00.509
Maybe that will help!

08:00.549 --> 08:03.416
Carl, do you know what a cappuccino is?

08:03.456 --> 08:05.054
An Italian sports car.

08:08.761 --> 08:12.307
We have Italian sports cars around
here, they're a lot of old cans.

08:13.346 --> 08:14.965
Let's go to work!

08:16.004 --> 08:18.641
A pair of magic shoes!

08:19.270 --> 08:24.605
All night the girl put on her special
shoes and ran through the woods...

08:25.034 --> 08:27.662
He danced, as if by magic, the entire night.

08:28.781 --> 08:34.284
When he woke up at dawn,
the shoes were gone.

08:36.173 --> 08:38.341
and she still could not walk.

08:40.849 --> 08:42.307
Nathan!

08:42.746 --> 08:44.705
Come here!

08:49.460 --> 08:52.127
-Because you do not finish the story.
-Agree.

08:56.053 --> 08:59.300
Finally, one day the girl woke up
and told her dream to her mother.

08:59.979 --> 09:03.256
Lying on the bed and motionless, he said:
I do not want to have more dreams

09:03.896 --> 09:05.314
Why? Asked his mother.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.971
Well, I'm tired of dancing
alone, said the girl.

09:08.921 --> 09:11.288
But you never danced alone, said her mother.

09:11.328 --> 09:14.275
You were dancing with the angels.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.619
I am sorry!

09:22.157 --> 09:24.015
I wore a pair of shoes just like this one.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.412
It, it seems dramatic, but

09:27.892 --> 09:31.008
I had never started dancing,
and it was wonderful...

09:32.677 --> 09:36.113
Well, someone got excited about the story.
Besides Mrs. Andrews?

09:36.833 --> 09:37.971
Noooo!

09:44.205 --> 09:46.193
Do not forget to finish
the art project!

09:46.893 --> 09:50.309
And please do not forget
the concert tonight!

09:50.968 --> 09:54.295
The choir members remember to arrive
half an hour early. Thank you!

10:01.018 --> 10:03.466
Hey you know. You have
to finish your studies,

10:03.506 --> 10:04.615
You could have a good
job here, Maggie.

10:04.655 --> 10:08.061
No, I like to do it voluntarily.
Especially the music.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.159
Yes, but think about the pay.

10:10.199 --> 10:14.914
Well, I do not see myself going back to
studios now. Maybe in a few years...

10:14.954 --> 10:17.842
- You would enter my place!
- You say the same thing every year

10:18.191 --> 10:21.088
Next year I'll be in Florida!

10:21.128 --> 10:24.725
-What are you going to do there?
-To have peace and quiet

10:24.765 --> 10:26.463
I'll leave the problems to you.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.707
How many farmers
involved so far?

10:33.736 --> 10:35.224
So far we have twenty-eight, more...

10:35.644 --> 10:38.181
- It bends but we're going to have to sweat the shirt.
- I have a list of names.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.516
I need all the necessary hydrology
documentation of the area that you made,

10:43.556 --> 10:47.562
they have water rights, until
the end of the 19th century.

10:47.911 --> 10:49.720
- All.
- It is done!

10:49.820 --> 10:54.645
I need a study of flora and fauna,
everything that lives: fish, plants. All

10:55.114 --> 10:57.732
The lady who paid the
taxes checks my folder.

10:58.761 --> 11:02.327
We still need your signature and
comments from Boswell Pharmaceutical

11:02.357 --> 11:03.186
They confirmed the interview that
was requested with his wife.

11:03.406 --> 11:05.104
Excellent!

11:05.754 --> 11:07.152
Robert!

11:07.871 --> 11:09.300
I received a call from
John Cardwell, we have

11:09.500 --> 11:11.088
the case of a complicated
farm, in your hands.

11:11.578 --> 11:13.086
Yes, I do not blame them. If
you can testify on your way

11:13.426 --> 11:15.284
There will be a farm
left in the city.

11:15.983 --> 11:17.822
- And when will he testify?
- Morning.

11:18.551 --> 11:20.039
This case is getting too long.

11:20.699 --> 11:22.547
You should have anticipated it before,
not letting things go forward.

11:30.109 --> 11:31.788
It's going to be OK!

11:32.797 --> 11:34.715
Excuse me, Mrs. Andrews

11:35.624 --> 11:37.562
What's up, Lily?

11:38.601 --> 11:40.998
My nose is blocked
and my throat hurts.

11:41.798 --> 11:44.225
I guess I will not sing tonight.

11:45.234 --> 11:46.673
Let see your language.

11:47.971 --> 11:49.740
Well, do you know what I think you have?

11:50.489 --> 11:52.906
Anxiety, I'm the same too.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.842
You know, after you start
singing, it will disappear.

11:57.672 --> 11:59.690
I promise

12:00.689 --> 12:02.627
We are going to be ready.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.434
I will see you later!

12:06.802 --> 12:09.240
Hi, I do not think we've met
before, I'm Lily's mother

12:09.610 --> 12:11.068
I'm Maggie Andrews, it's a pleasure.

12:11.608 --> 12:12.926
Pleasure in knowing her too.

12:13.656 --> 12:14.755
Lily is just adorable.

12:15.544 --> 12:18.471
-Where did you get that voice from?
-I assure you not of me.

12:19.909 --> 12:21.628
- Can I help with these chairs?
- I would like to, thank you!

12:22.607 --> 12:24.904
I studied music for
some time, but...

12:25.544 --> 12:27.811
-You studied music?
-Yes.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.268
Until I found my husband, he
went to law school and...

12:31.308 --> 12:35.564
We had a mountain of accounts to pay and the
music did not seem to be very practical...

12:35.604 --> 12:37.572
Then, I went to study
administration.

12:37.612 --> 12:41.807
- When was your son born had to stop working?
- Something like that.

12:42.057 --> 12:45.833
-And you?
-I am also a teacher... in my dreams.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.629
-Your husband must be very proud of Lily?
-It is.

12:51.678 --> 12:54.205
He is here?

12:55.094 --> 12:55.963
Is coming.

13:20.728 --> 13:22.687
How are you, Kate?
-Good and you?

13:25.494 --> 13:29.130
- Robert is here?
-You know your son.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.098
- How are you, Dalton?
- Well well. Thank you!

13:31.558 --> 13:33.715
Do not you think I
should wear a tie?

13:34.415 --> 13:35.903
Come on! You know I hate ties

13:41.867 --> 13:44.055
You will be great!

13:48.661 --> 13:51.697
Oh, dear, I'm sorry I created a fool for a son.

13:52.427 --> 13:54.734
It's not his fault, he
can not stop working.

13:56.423 --> 13:57.821
Like his father!

14:14.714 --> 14:16.932
Mom!

14:18.531 --> 14:20.519
-Good luck, mom.
-I love you.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.635
-Thank you!
-I love you so much.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.592
Do not fall behind!

14:28.640 --> 14:30.619
My Lord, let me do this work.

14:33.126 --> 14:34.375
Thank you!

14:48.191 --> 14:50.758
Thank you, Thank you
all for being here.

14:51.518 --> 14:55.144
My name is Maggie Andrews, and
I'm the director of the Choir

14:56.622 --> 15:00.858
We have a great show tonight, your
children are great. They worked a lot!

15:01.637 --> 15:05.633
And for this reason, I have great news:
The city has chosen its children

15:06.413 --> 15:10.179
to sing during the illumination of the
Christmas tree in the Plaza de la Ciudad.

15:15.404 --> 15:17.841
The rehearsals will start next holiday
and it is better to be prepared!

15:25.354 --> 15:30.988
OK, let's start. To kick off tonight,
we have a wonderful young singer.

15:32.087 --> 15:33.615
Miss Lilly Layton.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.953
Watch out!

16:07.452 --> 16:10.568
Dalton, I still think you're driving too fast.

16:11.468 --> 16:12.896
Silly stuff!

16:13.785 --> 16:16.802
-And you should wear a tie.
-I never liked wearing ties.

16:19.949 --> 16:22.497
He is very kind to bring me here.

16:23.645 --> 16:25.424
I really live next door, so...

16:26.173 --> 16:30.159
- Would you accept a tea?
- No no. I have to go.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.265
Oh, Dalton, you can stay, I insist!
I want to talk about tonight.

16:35.144 --> 16:37.971
I have to order a table full of papers
waiting for me. Anyway, thank you!

16:39.190 --> 16:41.038
-Hey, Robert!
-Hi! How are you?

16:42.057 --> 16:45.623
Dalton, who is this stranger in my house?
Do not wait, do not tell me.

16:47.681 --> 16:49.460
Oh yes, my son, the lawyer!

16:50.668 --> 16:52.906
- Why do not they put the correct name?
- The price of the company!

16:52.946 --> 16:56.602
A hundred dollars per hour. Dalton, a mother
should not be on her son's side, right?

16:56.632 --> 16:58.770
Mothers love their
children, good or bad.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.928
There is a big difference.

17:00.968 --> 17:03.955
- I need you to sign this.
- What is it.

17:04.594 --> 17:05.703
Revised taxes.

17:05.742 --> 17:08.970
- Work work work. He can not wait?
- Mom, hurry!

17:09.010 --> 17:12.806
Dalton, do not tell me you're tired
it will be when you reach my age.

17:12.846 --> 17:15.194
- Listen to your mother. Goodnight!
- Goodbye!

17:17.002 --> 17:19.290
Sign it! Put it in your mailbox!

17:20.788 --> 17:23.905
- I'm going!
- Robert, do not just think about work!

17:24.604 --> 17:25.613
I already heard you!

17:25.963 --> 17:28.221
- Remember!
- I'm listening!

17:35.374 --> 17:37.122
Kate!

17:54.904 --> 17:58.181
I'm sorry, I had a lot of
cases to review for tomorrow.

17:59.439 --> 18:01.198
And you had to be
until 08:30 PM?

18:02.257 --> 18:07.392
You never had cases where you
stayed until 08:30 at night

18:07.431 --> 18:09.759
All this because I did not
want to go to a concert.

18:11.208 --> 18:14.235
I had 10 thousand phone calls!
Desktop routines

18:25.503 --> 18:27.661
And then someone leaves
for some reason.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.486
It seems to have no life.

18:35.673 --> 18:36.892
I know you, Robert.

18:36.932 --> 18:40.388
And I know that you are capable of
doing anything, even when you can not.

18:41.278 --> 18:43.395
It's Lily who worries me.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.101
She is awake?

18:48.730 --> 18:50.568
Yes!

19:01.168 --> 19:02.287
Hello!

19:03.016 --> 19:06.333
I will not talk to you
I'm in the middle of the Show.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.208
You should not have a
television in your room

19:11.407 --> 19:13.595
-Who is that device?
-Of yours.

19:16.492 --> 19:18.780
I assure you it is
the best for you

19:21.367 --> 19:23.276
How was it?

19:24.354 --> 19:25.583
I was pretty good

19:26.333 --> 19:28.460
-The people asked me for
BIS, daddy -I bet that yes.

19:29.359 --> 19:31.208
You really would
have liked the Show

19:32.227 --> 19:35.054
But, Daddy... I wanted
you to be there

19:38.261 --> 19:40.179
Next time I will go.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.206
I promise.

19:53.096 --> 19:57.042
I know you're tired of hearing the same thing,
but I did not have to be there to
feel proud of you

20:04.694 --> 20:06.722
Kate!

20:31.887 --> 20:37.002
Is not it wonderful? We are all proud of Lily
Layton. How beautiful the future awaits you.

20:39.829 --> 20:42.177
Doctor Mather, come in!

20:44.904 --> 20:46.143
Excuse me, it's too late.

20:46.772 --> 20:49.349
Did not know that the
doctors made visits?

20:50.029 --> 20:52.127
Well, there are exceptions.

20:53.275 --> 20:55.134
Please sit down!

20:59.140 --> 21:01.158
Maggie, the exam results came.

21:02.296 --> 21:04.195
And they are not good.

21:05.214 --> 21:07.152
Your heart is not
pumping correctly.

21:08.161 --> 21:10.318
That's why he has
difficulty breathing.

21:10.788 --> 21:13.116
You have an incongruent
failure in the heart.

21:17.072 --> 21:18.420
But how...

21:19.040 --> 21:21.487
We thought it was
because of the flu.

21:22.226 --> 21:24.324
It is an inflammation
of the myocardium.

21:24.994 --> 21:28.051
It has the same symptoms, but...
it's not the flu.

21:28.630 --> 21:31.417
I would have liked it to be so...
I really would have loved

21:31.847 --> 21:34.354
We think it may be
caused by a virus.

21:36.103 --> 21:37.032
What does it mean?

21:37.461 --> 21:41.337
It means that Maggie's heart
muscle cells are being destroyed.

21:42.246 --> 21:44.155
And this is getting worse.

21:44.864 --> 21:46.103
And now, what are we going to do?

21:46.143 --> 21:51.168
There is nothing more that can be done, I
want to send you to Boston, for more tests.

22:07.281 --> 22:09.579
I can not do this!

22:10.378 --> 22:12.486
Do you need the instruments to sing?

22:13.086 --> 22:14.204
This looks good!

22:15.034 --> 22:19.090
Maybe I'll take one or two for Maggie.
You know how much he loves Chocolate.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.977
I also like Maggie, I wish
I had met her before.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.145
I would have liked to help
her with the whole concert.

22:25.253 --> 22:29.709
I'm feeling aromas, I'll have
to see where they come from

22:30.109 --> 22:32.536
So this is what was driving
me crazy while shaving.

22:33.155 --> 22:35.423
- Do not!
- I think you should return this to the store.

22:35.843 --> 22:36.332
-Just one?
-Dad!

22:36.972 --> 22:38.220
Dad, no!

22:39.090 --> 22:41.068
I see that they are not for me.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.855
They are for the choir!

22:44.894 --> 22:46.982
And, you'll go to the Christmas Concert, right?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.298
If there is a DAY in the year, what
can you count on me is Christmas.

22:50.938 --> 22:54.714
And happily, without a shadow of a doubt,
it will be the last Christmas in this house

22:54.744 --> 22:57.441
Next year we will
be in Madison Hill.

22:58.230 --> 23:01.187
Why Madison Hill?
I do not want to live there.

23:01.217 --> 23:04.095
You will love it, you
will have a large room.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.912
You have an interview with Boswell
Pharmaceutical at 10 o'clock in the morning

23:06.952 --> 23:08.510
Interview for what?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.378
For a new job for mom.

23:10.578 --> 23:12.696
I do not think Robert, I thought
we would talk about it.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.683
- Talk?
- Forget this! I'm going to do the interview.

23:15.723 --> 23:20.638
- I worked hard for this.
- Very good, good. Case closed, I will.

23:22.216 --> 23:23.535
It is true!

23:33.086 --> 23:34.384
Lily!

23:38.410 --> 23:40.328
If you are going to get that job

23:41.957 --> 23:44.055
... I think I will
not see you either.

23:52.236 --> 23:55.203
I called the parents so they did
not send me email after I left.

23:55.993 --> 23:58.130
Doctors say I have to
go to a Heart Hospital

23:58.800 --> 24:00.748
-You'll need a transplant?
-They say it's the only thing they can do

24:01.707 --> 24:04.035
The good news is that they are
determined to make me live.

24:04.774 --> 24:07.131
When they call, we have to go
to Boston as fast as possible

24:07.941 --> 24:09.809
we have to carry these Beeper

24:11.038 --> 24:12.676
Jack has one too.

24:13.925 --> 24:16.052
If you need... of anything,
if I can help in any way.

24:17.051 --> 24:19.399
Well, I was thinking, if you get a
call from school, maybe you could...

24:20.328 --> 24:23.225
take care of Nathan, we'll hire
an assistant to be with him
while we are in Boston.

24:23.265 --> 24:26.282
No, it will not be necessary, Nathan
can stay with me until they return

24:27.781 --> 24:29.759
-Insurance?
-Absolutely.

24:31.087 --> 24:34.894
I have excellent neighbors who like children
who visit them and drink chocolate...

24:34.934 --> 24:38.640
..if Nathan stays with me, rest
assured that he will do his homework

24:38.930 --> 24:41.967
-Everything is set.
-Thank you

24:47.171 --> 24:48.890
Oh, Lily!

24:56.172 --> 24:57.991
Hello everyone!

24:59.689 --> 25:02.386
All right, everyone,
let's get ready.

25:37.431 --> 25:40.578
Well, everyone open their singing books.

25:40.878 --> 25:43.865
We are going to work in groups.

25:47.411 --> 25:49.639
You left it on the
kitchen table.

25:58.949 --> 26:01.297
Maggie, is everything okay?

26:01.847 --> 26:04.004
Do you want me to call a doctor?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.611
I can not do this, I have no strength.

26:08.710 --> 26:11.217
-Kate, can you do me a favor?
-Insurance!

26:12.136 --> 26:14.344
-Continue the class.
-You mean now?

26:14.684 --> 26:16.262
No, I mean the
Christmas Program.

26:16.892 --> 26:19.059
Oh, Maggie, I can not... I
do not have experience...

26:19.829 --> 26:22.616
-But you studied music.
-Yes, but it was a long time ago...

26:23.745 --> 26:26.032
... I can not, I'm not capable.

26:26.822 --> 26:28.929
But you have the heart.

26:30.568 --> 26:32.716
It's just a joke.

26:35.533 --> 26:36.911
Is that...

26:37.771 --> 26:40.118
I have something today.

26:53.425 --> 26:55.573
I do not get!

26:57.161 --> 26:58.850
These children!

27:13.934 --> 27:15.293
Where are the other Lily?

27:15.613 --> 27:17.771
Oh! I know where they
are, I can in a second

27:18.850 --> 27:20.348
Are here!

27:21.857 --> 27:24.824
I think dad has gone crazy.
Fill out the form.

27:25.713 --> 27:26.512
Why? do not!

27:27.651 --> 27:30.838
Oh! Who does this here, your
father had to return it.

27:37.661 --> 27:39.559
It is better to go up to your room.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.150
What's happening, Kate?
You lost your interview.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.508
Something came up at school

27:51.547 --> 27:54.344
-What are you talking about.
-I'm going to do the Christmas Program.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.986
This is not happening, you
did not leave everything.

28:02.026 --> 28:07.031
Did you change the interview for a Christmas
program at school? This is a joke!

28:07.641 --> 28:09.559
-Maggie, be sick.
Maggie?

28:10.658 --> 28:13.545
The music teacher, Robert.
From the choir.

28:13.615 --> 28:17.201
Have an Aspirin, that's
not your problem.

28:19.988 --> 28:24.054
She is waiting for a heart transplant...
a heart transplant.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.622
Something that you could consider.

28:30.688 --> 28:33.555
You have the opportunity
to get a great job.

28:33.695 --> 28:36.462
..in which anyone would do everything
to get it, and you do not want it?

28:37.431 --> 28:40.897
By the way, because the School does not
place a substitute. Are not taxes for that?

28:41.816 --> 28:43.745
It is a voluntary work. If Maggie does not...

28:43.784 --> 28:47.421
... I did it, there would be no Choir,
and without Chorus, our daughter ..

28:47.461 --> 28:50.877
..and the rest of the children, they would
not have experience singing for one ..

28:50.917 --> 28:54.724
community. And I do not know why
I'm giving you explanations.

28:56.841 --> 28:57.701
I think there must be
another volunteer.

28:58.690 --> 29:00.997
There must be someone responsible.

29:01.717 --> 29:02.895
Is that witchcraft?

29:03.465 --> 29:05.283
Because you?

29:07.471 --> 29:10.608
And, why not me, Robert?
why?

29:10.738 --> 29:15.872
This is important for me, maybe it's
something that will make me feel good.

29:16.482 --> 29:19.529
Look, I know this can interfere with

29:19.569 --> 29:21.137
your plans to make money,
but what is best for you.

29:21.177 --> 29:24.274
It's not about me,
it's about the family.

29:25.053 --> 29:28.969
-Then, they are your dreams, you want me to follow you.
-You know what my dreams are?

29:29.828 --> 29:33.125
My dreams are... I'll tell you: I'd
like to go to Dean's desk and ..

29:33.165 --> 29:35.982
tell him to deliver the
cases to someone else.

29:36.771 --> 29:40.348
But I'm not telling you, you know why?
because I have a family to support.

29:40.538 --> 29:44.714
-I feel we are a burden!
- Oh please.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.489
I just want to say that.

30:04.194 --> 30:06.692
What I want to say is: You do
not know what my dreams are.

30:12.366 --> 30:14.574
Robert, that's a problem...

30:15.623 --> 30:17.601
for us two!

31:08.260 --> 31:10.308
Nathan Andrews, what's happening?

31:14.044 --> 31:15.213
Your heart...

31:15.942 --> 31:19.599
... I wanted to know if it was still beating.

31:37.461 --> 31:41.377
This will not work, this will not work!

31:43.644 --> 31:45.253
I said, this would not work.

31:49.848 --> 31:51.247
Sorry!

31:51.287 --> 31:55.043
-Works at Wilson's. -Better,
I'm the owner, Tom Wilson.

31:55.363 --> 31:59.019
This fell out of a delivery truck, I
tried to return it but it was closed.

31:59.059 --> 32:00.927
I called, but a young man
said he was not there.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.335
OK, most people
travel in this era

32:03.375 --> 32:06.512
It seems that the shipping in our.

32:07.860 --> 32:10.118
- It's not exactly your style, but I'll try.
- Very good. Thank you!

32:31.367 --> 32:33.205
I'll call a crane for you.

32:33.245 --> 32:35.513
No, I'll take it to the
one who sold it to me.

32:35.552 --> 32:40.358
No, no, trust me, I know a man,
honest, decent and knows about cars

32:41.596 --> 32:45.063
- I mean, it does not turn on. You will save time.
- Very well thanks.

32:52.496 --> 32:55.812
Well, I'll give you a test, but...
It's probably electric.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.979
Well, I want it as
quickly as possible.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.497
-I will do what i can.
-All right.

33:02.925 --> 33:06.192
Oh, please, put a blanket
over him tonight, okay?

33:08.839 --> 33:10.368
All right.

33:12.855 --> 33:15.243
That guy, he looks like
he drinks cappuccino.

33:24.164 --> 33:26.072
I have to go.

33:41.646 --> 33:44.294
Well, you have something for me, boy.

33:45.443 --> 33:47.670
What do you say if we have an ice cream?

33:49.029 --> 33:50.458
No thanks.

33:50.547 --> 33:52.585
Insurance?

33:53.584 --> 33:55.702
Have you met someone
who likes to hide?

33:59.199 --> 34:00.078
Do not!

34:06.901 --> 34:11.626
I bet you're hungry,
let's get out of here!

34:28.020 --> 34:29.697
Please, can I have your
attention, children?

34:30.476 --> 34:32.594
Attention please!

34:35.393 --> 34:36.731
Class!

34:49.697 --> 34:51.726
Hello everyone.

34:52.445 --> 34:54.453
I'm Kate Layton, Lily's mom.

34:55.592 --> 35:00.787
I'm here to replace Mrs.
Andrews while she's...

35:05.762 --> 35:05.802
Well, listen, I'll need your...

35:06.352 --> 35:09.758
help, I've never done this before, but Ms.
Andrews says that

35:09.798 --> 35:15.283
you are the most, and I know that it is
true because I was in all the concerts

35:15.323 --> 35:19.418
Including when Troy
vomited in the box.

35:22.915 --> 35:28.320
This upcoming Christmas
concert will be great!

35:28.629 --> 35:33.075
Mrs. Andrews is counting on you and
we will not disappoint her, right?

35:33.115 --> 35:35.093
-True!
-As?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.760
-True!
-Sorry?

35:39.438 --> 35:43.255
-True!
-True! Okay, so let's go
to page 33 of the book.

36:05.482 --> 36:09.259
Dr. Lawrence, call 76. Dr.
Lawrence, room 76, please.

36:10.367 --> 36:13.215
-What fast!
-We do it as quickly as possible.

36:13.255 --> 36:14.763
Better put the seat belt.

36:14.803 --> 36:17.930
-Doctor, who is the donor?
-A teenager.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.987
Your poor mother.

36:23.644 --> 36:25.283
I will leave as soon as I finish.

36:40.827 --> 36:43.025
-Curtain lights.
-You like them, do you?

36:43.055 --> 36:47.390
Mrs. Layton takes Christmas seriously.
It took a week to prepare these things

36:49.219 --> 36:50.487
Here, come!

36:52.425 --> 36:54.383
-Hello Ellen!
-Dalton!

36:55.382 --> 36:57.970
-This is Nathan!
-Good good good...

36:59.199 --> 37:01.926
- Hello!
- Will stay with me this
night. Maybe a couple of nights.

37:02.176 --> 37:06.132
I knew you would come. Come with
me, I want to show you something.

37:11.686 --> 37:13.564
Here it is!

37:24.703 --> 37:27.400
- He has all the things that the Red Sox.
- My son!

37:27.610 --> 37:30.917
-A long time ago.
- He must have been good.

37:30.997 --> 37:35.532
It was, everything I did was
practice and practice...

37:36.271 --> 37:38.110
He had to be the best.

37:38.150 --> 37:41.286
-What is your favorite team?
-Oh The Red Sox.

37:41.496 --> 37:43.974
Oh, this is not good.

37:45.902 --> 37:47.740
Maybe you like this.

37:51.037 --> 37:53.195
I'm sure it will work for you.

37:54.753 --> 37:57.330
-Robert will not even know that I'll give it to you.
-Thank you

38:07.580 --> 38:09.268
What is that?

38:11.586 --> 38:13.494
Robert's lunch box.

38:14.623 --> 38:16.202
Well, Cool!

38:18.239 --> 38:20.058
Cool!

38:48.569 --> 38:55.063
Dear Robert, I was remembering
when you were a child

38:56.911 --> 38:59.328
Jack and if the procedure did not work?

39:01.756 --> 39:04.014
I do not know.

39:12.275 --> 39:13.914
The news is not good.

39:14.903 --> 39:16.811
We had problems with
the donor's heart

39:18.120 --> 39:19.808
It was perfect for
your blood type.

39:21.007 --> 39:23.464
But he was infected
with type B hepatitis.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.082
I am so sorry!

39:27.091 --> 39:30.157
And what do we do now? I mean,
there must be something I can do.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.573
Maybe there is another donor, there
is always an opportunity, right?

39:34.613 --> 39:36.781
As Maggie's immune
system is failing,

39:37.910 --> 39:40.587
and her blood type is hard
to find, the odds are...

39:40.627 --> 39:44.253
just for a miracle!

40:02.046 --> 40:04.113
Jack, we must go home.

40:05.182 --> 40:07.720
I'm not going to stay in a hospital.

40:21.876 --> 40:23.444
I want to make an
offer for that house.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.028
I thought you said you
could not pay it.

40:30.077 --> 40:33.274
The Christmas program will end in a couple
of weeks, I will continue after that.

40:33.314 --> 40:35.862
I do not know after that.

40:39.618 --> 40:40.018
Kate!

40:40.997 --> 40:42.675
What are you trying to do

40:44.024 --> 40:45.912
What is happening?

40:47.960 --> 40:52.016
I like the School project, I
like to work with young people.

40:52.945 --> 40:55.122
Maybe I want to teach.

40:55.772 --> 40:58.599
- Go back to school.
- My teaching title is fine.

40:58.899 --> 41:02.945
-When did this start?
-Robert, I'm trying to talk to you for months.

41:02.985 --> 41:06.911
You are never here, the same as when you are,
it seems like I can not get your attention

41:06.951 --> 41:09.948
I was just trying to
make a living, Kate.

41:16.831 --> 41:18.949
What kind of support is that, Robert?

41:20.087 --> 41:22.245
And at what price?

41:25.542 --> 41:28.509
We were two people who
shared the same house.

41:30.008 --> 41:31.776
and sometimes, the same bed.

41:35.092 --> 41:36.941
There are no more options.

41:44.853 --> 41:47.280
I guess you do not want
me to make a new offer.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.660
Think about it a little!

42:12.925 --> 42:14.853
Everything is alright?

42:14.893 --> 42:16.501
If it is!

42:20.247 --> 42:21.346
Oh, Kate!

42:21.386 --> 42:24.743
Hi, Maggie, I did not know if it was all right,
maybe it would be better to come back later.

42:24.783 --> 42:25.822
Nonsense, sit down!

42:26.041 --> 42:27.950
-I will prepare lunch!
-Thank you!

42:28.529 --> 42:30.937
I was dying to chat together
about Christmas music.

42:32.585 --> 42:35.152
-How have the boys behaved?
-Excellent.

42:35.672 --> 42:37.510
I need your advice, Maggie.

42:37.550 --> 42:41.656
I thought, instead of singing on the Christmas
tree, maybe, singing in the streets.

42:42.065 --> 42:45.162
-Resolved, I love it.
-Really?

42:45.202 --> 42:46.241
If you could go from
house to house.

42:48.199 --> 42:53.354
Well, Pierdy complains that almost 90
percent of the fish die at 81, 82 and 83.

42:53.554 --> 42:57.410
Well, those claims are
incredible, ninety percent?

42:57.530 --> 43:01.026
The highest water levels
were ten years ago, then no.

43:01.116 --> 43:02.984
We are receiving more people

43:03.824 --> 43:05.752
- Gwen?
- I'm trying.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.319
Try again. And what about
the Woodshole expert?

43:08.359 --> 43:10.527
It is available, but it was
never used as an expert.

43:11.526 --> 43:15.072
Well if you wait a little longer,
you'll have the biologist who ..

43:15.112 --> 43:17.640
He talked with David
about the Stanley case.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.427
I can not use that type. get to
the Woodshole, he is the man.

43:23.034 --> 43:24.663
Pierdy complains that the farmers...

43:24.703 --> 43:27.240
... they consume a lot of water,
they will testify that the fish die

43:27.760 --> 43:31.955
When the level of the lakes is higher, it
will kill him, Gwen bring them together.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.669
- Mr. Layton?
-Yes!

43:39.678 --> 43:42.605
- Rivercity real estate on line two,
and this was sent by his mother
- Thank you!

43:52.385 --> 43:55.272
-Hello Jeanny.
- Mr. Layton, I was calling you

43:55.971 --> 43:57.889
I had a long day...

43:58.659 --> 44:02.984
It's about the Madison Hill house, I'm sorry
to inform you that there was another offer.

44:04.043 --> 44:05.712
What do you mean, with another offer?

44:05.881 --> 44:09.338
-Someone gave another higher offer.
-And they accepted?

44:09.378 --> 44:11.106
I think so!

44:11.995 --> 44:13.764
You promised me that I would
be the first to know.

44:14.603 --> 44:16.791
I'm very sorry, Mr. Layton,
but I could not find it.

44:17.999 --> 44:22.345
-All right, if this offer fails, let me know.
-I will do so.

44:24.703 --> 44:27.670
No salt is tasty!

44:32.115 --> 44:34.093
-You're good?
-I'm fine, go to work

44:36.151 --> 44:39.847
Wherever you go, just in case.

44:44.563 --> 44:45.782
go away! go away!

44:47.849 --> 44:49.378
Bye! bye!

44:51.676 --> 44:56.850
I do not remember when it was the last time
I saw my husband for lunch, dinner or...

44:57.010 --> 44:59.148
... at the school parent meeting.

45:01.945 --> 45:05.192
I know we live in the same house because
we have to brush our teeth in the morning.

45:05.821 --> 45:07.790
and toothpaste mixed
in the middle.

45:10.367 --> 45:12.775
You know what I think, I think they
are getting slower and slower.

45:16.561 --> 45:19.338
How long are you going to hide that?

45:21.216 --> 45:24.473
I do not know if I can
do more of that, Maggie.

45:31.556 --> 45:33.574
How long are you married?

45:35.532 --> 45:38.259
-Not enough.
-Oh, Maggie, I'm so sorry.

45:38.299 --> 45:39.188
Is nothing.

45:44.303 --> 45:46.361
The problem with Jack...

45:48.539 --> 45:51.716
... he is not ready for
what is going to happen.

45:52.715 --> 45:55.002
Not a little prepared

46:00.597 --> 46:02.685
And Nathan!

46:04.733 --> 46:08.439
I do not want to leave them Kate, I
do not want to leave them like that.

46:19.897 --> 46:21.835
I am sorry!

46:35.242 --> 46:39.078
If you need help with the lesson
at home let me know, okay?

46:41.825 --> 46:44.533
Sometimes I'm afraid
to go home...

46:45.502 --> 46:48.159
and not find my mom.

47:02.874 --> 47:06.441
It's hard to imagine, but Jack and I met
in one of those dance studio classrooms

47:06.481 --> 47:09.428
Jack, and you, kid!

47:10.647 --> 47:13.943
-Nathan?
-Yes!

47:14.663 --> 47:16.760
-How is school going?
- A nuisance!

47:17.929 --> 47:19.697
Great.

47:22.385 --> 47:28.089
Well, anyway, since I was a girl
I loved dancing, but not Jack.

47:28.129 --> 47:32.085
- His mother made him take dance lessons.
- Poor Jack!

47:32.395 --> 47:35.831
- I think she thought about giving him a little pose.
- Or help with the girls.

47:36.830 --> 47:38.988
-Exactly, it helped me.
-And you him.

47:40.846 --> 47:44.463
So every year on our anniversary,
we get dressed and go dancing.

47:45.392 --> 47:47.500
It is very romantic!

47:48.648 --> 47:51.626
I used to have that
pair of dance shoes...

47:52.365 --> 47:54.263
I do not know what happened to them...

47:55.831 --> 47:59.228
every time I put them
on, I just felt so...

48:00.936 --> 48:03.204
...special.

48:04.872 --> 48:08.479
Those few hours once a year...

48:08.609 --> 48:11.506
... they were magical.

48:21.226 --> 48:26.700
Jack, I hated to dance,
but I did it for me.

48:30.377 --> 48:31.715
How good!

48:33.274 --> 48:36.361
It was not bad either,
with each of his hands.

48:57.010 --> 48:58.888
Hey, take care little man!

49:11.206 --> 49:15.841
<i>Attention to all visitors, there is a special
discount on the sale of men's clothing.</i>

49:15.881 --> 49:18.459
<i>Attention to all visitors, there is a special
discount on the sale of men's clothing.</i>

49:34.053 --> 49:35.871
Perfect

49:47.490 --> 49:48.878
$ 19.99-

50:13.883 --> 50:15.342
Pa .. I need to work!

50:15.382 --> 50:17.529
I need a job now, please!

50:17.569 --> 50:22.105
Well dad, it's very important!

50:22.145 --> 50:24.742
It is very very important!

50:24.782 --> 50:27.869
A job, what are you talking
about, why are not you home?

50:27.909 --> 50:31.426
Hey Boss, the capuchin man
wants to talk to you!

50:31.466 --> 50:36.161
-All right!
-I need to earn some money.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.618
Please daddy!

50:38.658 --> 50:42.824
Nathan, I'm not going
to want puppies, okay?

50:42.864 --> 50:45.501
Do you understand ?, without puppies

50:46.480 --> 50:50.207
But dad, it's not about puppies.

50:52.844 --> 50:54.902
You have my car since last week .. and ..

50:56.311 --> 50:57.589
What accounts are these?

50:57.629 --> 51:00.576
When Jack Andrews takes
an expensive car, sir...

51:05.451 --> 51:08.039
Money is like tin, when you
get to like it, it ends.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.182
You see, 5 cents is 5 cents.

51:26.460 --> 51:28.628
You give me that can, dad!

51:44.203 --> 51:47.519
You did not do well on your
last math test, little man!

51:47.559 --> 51:48.858
I know!

51:49.467 --> 51:51.515
-You can do much better.
- Hey, look at that!

51:52.824 --> 51:54.912
-This is great!
-Great!

51:54.942 --> 51:57.240
It's an empty, dirty can,
what are you talking about?

51:57.280 --> 51:58.808
It's worth 5 cents.

51:59.338 --> 52:02.984
If I get twenty I'll have a dollar,
and I'll pick up a lot more.

52:03.523 --> 52:04.772
I'll make more money

52:05.991 --> 52:09.328
and I can buy a special gift
for my mom at Christmas.

52:11.935 --> 52:14.353
Well enter the car.

52:15.391 --> 52:16.880
Good idea!

52:34.023 --> 52:35.252
Hello, Jake

52:37.359 --> 52:40.536
Mr. Layton, Ronald came.
Nobody else.

52:41.306 --> 52:43.973
When I heard that he was coming,
some others waited to see him.

52:45.371 --> 52:48.019
I know how important
water is for you.

52:48.698 --> 52:50.277
That's it!

52:52.175 --> 52:56.231
Well, I brought a camera, show me
the home of the famous remora.

53:23.094 --> 53:27.599
Not all developers, or Pierdy
environmental groups have achieved it.

53:28.279 --> 53:30.077
Are we going to lose our farms, Mr.
Layton?

53:30.826 --> 53:33.763
Many of us here, we have our roots for
more than one hundred years on this earth

53:33.933 --> 53:36.300
None of that would make a difference for a judge.

53:37.399 --> 53:39.088
Why are they behind
people like us?

53:39.128 --> 53:41.995
Because of fish that nobody wants
to fish and nobody wants to eat?

53:42.914 --> 53:44.173
PIERDY companies like it.

53:45.162 --> 53:47.379
They take advantage of the environment,
they do not care about the fish

53:48.079 --> 53:49.357
They want their lands.

53:50.197 --> 53:52.574
They cut the water, they lower
the prices they buy cheap and ..

53:53.413 --> 53:55.641
It is then that they sell
for a much higher price

53:56.041 --> 53:58.059
I think it's the fish
that are hurting us.

53:59.238 --> 54:01.655
My grandfather was a farmer
during the Great Depression...

54:02.205 --> 54:03.763
... the bank took away his land.

54:06.131 --> 54:08.029
I do not know if we will achieve it...

54:09.707 --> 54:11.455
... but let's fight.

54:13.204 --> 54:15.291
I will talk to all the
experts personally.

54:16.690 --> 54:19.168
whatever the argument they
have to block irrigation.

54:19.747 --> 54:23.893
Well, if we do not win, we
will not be together next year

54:29.637 --> 54:30.666
Thank you!

54:32.155 --> 54:33.134
Thank you!

54:46.220 --> 54:48.119
Nathan, come here!

54:55.221 --> 54:56.590
Nathan!

55:00.876 --> 55:02.005
Nathan!

55:02.744 --> 55:04.432
Why are not you answering me?

55:05.092 --> 55:06.340
I wanted to surprise
Mom with those lights.

55:06.430 --> 55:09.767
Mom has to rest,
without surprises.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.775
The dinner is ready

55:13.563 --> 55:15.421
Nathan!

55:16.580 --> 55:20.556
Thanks for the lights, they are beautiful!

55:21.395 --> 55:23.134
You're welcome!

55:26.161 --> 55:30.426
Your mom is right, the
lights are great son.

55:40.806 --> 55:43.203
I think I'm going to get it, like that, ah?

55:45.961 --> 55:49.277
Honey, talk to Nathan tonight.

56:01.985 --> 56:04.662
-Canta!
-Don't sing this song!

56:20.906 --> 56:21.835
Daddy!

56:25.012 --> 56:27.000
Hello, Robert!
-We already took the dinner.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.457
I'm sorry, I'm late
because of some clients.

56:29.497 --> 56:30.916
We thought you would not come.

56:34.612 --> 56:37.779
Well, sometimes I am
surprised by myself.

56:39.317 --> 56:42.214
We knew you would come, we are going
to prepare something for dinner.

56:45.082 --> 56:46.810
Robert!

56:47.639 --> 56:49.667
Sit down!

56:50.366 --> 56:53.273
It smells good, everything smells good!

56:54.642 --> 56:56.910
This is the test
of the pink tray.

57:05.211 --> 57:06.540
This pink tray is the
improvement you have made.

57:06.580 --> 57:10.956
Robert, I'm not blind
and I'm not stupid!

57:11.465 --> 57:13.973
Something is wrong between you and Kate.

57:17.149 --> 57:18.798
You're right.

57:19.997 --> 57:23.383
You know, people actually go
through things that are very...

57:24.732 --> 57:26.400
... more complicated!

57:26.440 --> 57:28.338
It's when you put your
marriage in play.

57:29.127 --> 57:34.152
And what are these things: power, prestige, taking
the account to see who is the first of the company.

57:36.860 --> 57:41.605
I still remember your feet
after you got out of the crib.

57:42.744 --> 57:44.512
And sometimes I remember...

57:45.091 --> 57:47.869
... the smell of grass,
after cutting it.

57:49.117 --> 57:54.162
Sixth grade... Oh, the man who became,
when he brought me the report card.

57:54.202 --> 57:55.971
All outstanding.

57:56.860 --> 57:58.888
... and your first deadly game.

57:59.807 --> 58:00.636
Rivercity against the Redsox.

58:02.564 --> 58:05.121
Oh, and when I saw the tears in
your eyes when they lost the game.

58:06.001 --> 58:07.939
Thinking you
disappointed the team.

58:07.979 --> 58:09.687
Common things, Robert.

58:09.727 --> 58:13.823
Simple things, from day to day.

58:14.612 --> 58:18.138
Your father failed, in
many of those things ..

58:18.178 --> 58:21.285
... he never shared these memories.

58:21.775 --> 58:23.533
At the end...

58:26.060 --> 58:30.126
... And in the end I think that
you would like to share them too

58:42.544 --> 58:45.841
They arrived separately,
they will split apart.

58:46.770 --> 58:49.877
They do not realize how
much they love each other.

58:51.485 --> 58:54.822
Sometimes the darkest
things are for some reason.

58:58.388 --> 58:59.777
-Good evening, Dalton!
-Goodnight!

59:06.959 --> 59:09.357
What things in the world, are
you doing with all those cans?

59:09.397 --> 59:13.743
What's wrong with trying to make
a better world for someone.

59:21.075 --> 59:23.193
Are you okay, do you look tired?

59:23.913 --> 59:27.169
I'm fine, just worried.

59:29.477 --> 59:31.135
Safe?

59:31.845 --> 59:32.993
Yes!

59:33.982 --> 59:35.301
Do you want me to help you
turn off all the lights?

59:35.341 --> 59:39.727
No, I'm going to leave them like
that, I'm going to sit a little.

59:40.945 --> 59:42.894
-Good, goodnight!
-Goodnight!

59:56.640 --> 59:58.128
Is beautiful!

59:58.937 --> 01:00:00.925
Your design is so smart.

01:00:03.123 --> 01:00:05.431
I would like to put
angels in the front, mom.

01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:09.896
I love the Angels.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.698
Soon I will see a lot of Angels.

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:21.355
you will do it?

01:00:21.395 --> 01:00:22.164
Yes!

01:00:22.204 --> 01:00:24.901
In the sky.

01:00:27.099 --> 01:00:29.607
Why does God have to
take you to heaven?

01:00:29.906 --> 01:00:32.044
I do not have all
the answers Nathan?

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:34.901
But...

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:40.726
... It's not like, that He takes me...

01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:45.801
..but it's ok that He is
receiving me in Heaven

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:51.335
-Exist animals in Heaven?
- I bet they have many animals.

01:00:51.365 --> 01:00:54.782
-Children?
-Principally puppies.

01:00:57.049 --> 01:01:01.854
Call me mom, I told dad... he would
not want to be taken to heaven!

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:05.930
No, he understands.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.798
Let me know if he changes his mind.

01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:13.153
You know...

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:19.137
.. Can you be somewhat angry with me sometimes, because I
have to go, but I want you to know that everything is fine.

01:01:21.365 --> 01:01:23.693
But remember always...

01:01:25.201 --> 01:01:27.449
... that you are my greatest joy.

01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:32.234
And I love you very much.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:41.235
Will the grandfather see?

01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:43.623
He will meet me at the door.

01:01:44.332 --> 01:01:45.681
Tell him one thing for me?

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:48.038
Insurance!

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:54.062
When I was alone, I found a
dollar in his dressing room...

01:01:54.122 --> 01:01:55.920
and I took it!

01:01:57.579 --> 01:02:03.143
And I ended up spending it. I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry.

01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:06.220
I will tell that to him.

01:02:11.345 --> 01:02:14.412
Do not go mom!

01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:17.898
I do not want you to
leave, I need you.

01:02:18.538 --> 01:02:21.135
I just have to go, dear. I have to...

01:02:21.425 --> 01:02:22.554
Take me with you.

01:02:22.594 --> 01:02:25.451
No, you need to stay
here with your daddy!

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.297
Nobody is going to take you out now
that you have to take care of him.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.459
Agree.

01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:41.495
Nathan.

01:02:42.464 --> 01:02:44.751
Even if mom has to leave...

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.927
you will always
know where mom is.

01:02:48.967 --> 01:02:51.205
..here!

01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:53.852
you promise me?

01:02:56.879 --> 01:02:58.598
I promise.

01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:03.703
Do you know mommy?

01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:07.699
Every time I feel
my heart beating

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.416
I will remember You

01:03:12.853 --> 01:03:14.032
Thank you!

01:03:59.247 --> 01:04:01.225
Oh God!

01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:06.689
Ellen!

01:04:09.337 --> 01:04:11.365
The lights left out here.

01:04:18.797 --> 01:04:20.316
Ellen!

01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:23.962
You left all the
lights on outside.

01:04:24.701 --> 01:04:26.630
It's going to cost
you a small fortune!

01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:28.608
Ellen!

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.399
Oh no!

01:05:09.157 --> 01:05:11.065
We had little time.

01:05:11.105 --> 01:05:12.903
It was very fast.

01:05:29.856 --> 01:05:32.843
She continues to live
inside of us, Robert.

01:06:00.645 --> 01:06:03.093
Feel free to call, no
matter the time. Agree?

01:06:08.148 --> 01:06:10.036
Do not delay, Jack.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:13.622
I appreciate everything.

01:06:22.553 --> 01:06:24.382
Daddy!

01:06:25.141 --> 01:06:27.988
-Where are you going?
-I'm going out.

01:06:28.028 --> 01:06:30.815
-With Dalton-True?

01:06:34.272 --> 01:06:38.767
- Well, I think I'll have to see...
- I'm going to buy cereals.

01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:42.863
I'm going to buy lunch, I'm
going to do a little ..

01:06:42.983 --> 01:06:44.581
Tuna sandwich.

01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:47.479
Dalton will arrive at any time.

01:06:52.224 --> 01:06:55.181
- Surely you do not want to stay?
- It's Christmas Eve, Dad.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.338
I have something important to do.

01:06:58.378 --> 01:07:00.186
Agree.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.439
Do not be late!

01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:46.969
Yes I know!

01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:52.793
- I brought this lunch!
- Oh thanks

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.250
Let's go downtown!

01:08:20.865 --> 01:08:24.042
This is the center of the river street.
You can find something here.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.017
It's one of the most beautiful Christmas
trees I've seen, what do you think?

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:37.129
-Get one!
-Excellent.

01:08:38.178 --> 01:08:39.716
Remember when I told you that ..

01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:42.433
I had never lost
anyone close to me?

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.202
Yes!

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:47.259
Well, I lied!

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:52.912
My wife died eleven years ago,
shortly before moving here.

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:55.121
Why did he lie?

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:59.736
Because it was painful
to talk about it.

01:09:00.705 --> 01:09:03.193
And why do you talk about it now?
-Why...

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:06.488
... I know the pain does not go away...

01:09:06.529 --> 01:09:09.247
... If you do not want to talk about it.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.462
It's good to know that.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.432
Let's cross here.

01:09:29.696 --> 01:09:31.045
- Hey, another one!
- Yes!

01:09:32.353 --> 01:09:34.051
- Another can!
-Yes!

01:09:35.281 --> 01:09:36.749
Uau!

01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:39.136
- Check it out!
- What's going on here?

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:41.533
This is a gold mine!

01:09:41.573 --> 01:09:45.041
- You were right, it's a great place
to find the cans.
- Yes

01:09:47.658 --> 01:09:51.944
Each one is worth 5 cents, and there
are probably a hundred of them...

01:09:51.984 --> 01:09:55.680
... then they are like 5 dollars.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.138
They are many cans

01:09:58.188 --> 01:10:01.065
And they are all mine. I'm
going to make a lot of money.

01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:05.261
And what will you do with that pile of money?

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.176
I'll buy the Christmas
shoes for my mother.

01:10:11.285 --> 01:10:13.752
Ok, let me help you.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.189
Where is Robert?

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.698
Let's wake up to the city!

01:11:58.897 --> 01:12:01.045
I have to go. It's Christmas Eve!

01:12:02.124 --> 01:12:04.191
You should go too.

01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.209
I beat him, Gwen.

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:09.696
Well, if no one can Robert, can

01:12:12.873 --> 01:12:14.241
Merry Christmas!

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.828
-Thank you!

01:12:18.247 --> 01:12:20.975
To you too.

01:13:17.168 --> 01:13:18.307
Jack.

01:13:28.467 --> 01:13:31.174
You have to let me go.

01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:44.751
I know.

01:13:47.148 --> 01:13:48.187
Jack

01:13:52.923 --> 01:13:54.921
About the puppy

01:14:01.964 --> 01:14:03.732
I will have to accept it.

01:14:17.718 --> 01:14:19.556
One more thing.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.059
We can dance?

01:14:43.282 --> 01:14:44.671
Agree!

01:14:47.558 --> 01:14:49.936
Ok, I have you!

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:35.470
-Hey!
-Sorry!

01:15:40.515 --> 01:15:43.822
Oh, no, no... no

01:15:47.987 --> 01:15:50.185
It can not be
closed, it can not.

01:15:51.354 --> 01:15:53.602
Open... Please!

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:04.151
-Excuse us sometimes we close the door
early.
-Thank you!

01:16:08.267 --> 01:16:10.105
How old are you?

01:16:10.585 --> 01:16:12.233
-Seven!
-seven!

01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:14.251
Excuse me, I'm looking for a...

01:16:14.811 --> 01:16:17.318
Lonely doll, I think
they saved one for me?

01:16:18.057 --> 01:16:22.343
We keep one until 6:00 p.m. It's
Christmas Eve, we had to sell it.

01:16:22.863 --> 01:16:25.680
I could try Dealinger's, but
they sure sold everything, too.

01:16:27.658 --> 01:16:29.016
Do not!

01:16:29.826 --> 01:16:31.214
Do not!

01:16:37.808 --> 01:16:40.365
Where is it?

01:16:41.524 --> 01:16:44.960
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the store
will close in five minutes</i>

01:16:50.545 --> 01:16:54.831
<i>Bring your purchases to the box, the
store will close in five minutes.</i>

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:03.852
Merry Christmas, Chaoo!

01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:05.919
Thank you!

01:17:10.015 --> 01:17:13.302
Hey boy, do you find it nice?

01:17:13.492 --> 01:17:14.411
Thank you Merry Christmas!

01:17:14.471 --> 01:17:17.318
You would prefer a
baseball, right?

01:17:18.727 --> 01:17:21.953
Well, I will find only child in the
world that does not reject such a gift.

01:17:32.912 --> 01:17:39.116
<i>Attention please, bring your purchases to
the cashier the store is already closed.</i>

01:17:39.396 --> 01:17:41.744
Next!

01:17:42.683 --> 01:17:44.161
Excuse me!

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:46.449
Excuse me, sir, it
will be super fast.

01:17:47.748 --> 01:17:49.576
Agree!

01:17:50.495 --> 01:17:52.683
Ten and nine and ninety-nine,
with the discount

01:17:57.818 --> 01:17:59.786
Please hurry up.

01:18:11.634 --> 01:18:12.533
Do not!

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:14.411
You are missing five
dollars and fifty cents

01:18:14.451 --> 01:18:16.359
What?

01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:21.254
I stuttered, or something like that. You
have five dollars and fifty cents less.

01:18:23.592 --> 01:18:25.110
Look boy...

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:30.455
You do not have enough money, you're
getting stuck, you come back next year.

01:18:30.495 --> 01:18:33.272
Then it will be very late!

01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:36.149
Very late!

01:18:38.007 --> 01:18:39.686
-Mr!
-Yes?

01:18:40.695 --> 01:18:42.273
-Mr!
-Yes!

01:18:51.734 --> 01:18:53.152
Hey guy!

01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:56.768
What is happening to you?

01:18:57.628 --> 01:18:59.785
I do not have enough money, and...

01:19:00.655 --> 01:19:02.653
My mom is really bad.

01:19:02.693 --> 01:19:06.369
Hey, hey calm!

01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:12.772
Sir, have you met someone
who was about to die.

01:19:19.106 --> 01:19:21.833
This will be my mom's Last Christmas...

01:19:22.693 --> 01:19:25.809
... And I wanted him to wear the shoes before...

01:19:27.678 --> 01:19:29.356
I left for Heaven.

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:43.592
You can take them.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.547
Oh, sir, it would help me,
I'll give it back, I promise.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.293
Is about...

01:19:53.442 --> 01:19:55.030
...it's for him.

01:19:58.786 --> 01:20:00.235
Thank my Lord!

01:20:25.679 --> 01:20:27.138
Mr!

01:20:27.877 --> 01:20:29.616
Ready?

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:31.763
He went!

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:35.829
Do not!

01:20:36.758 --> 01:20:38.657
No, I do not think it is.

01:21:11.723 --> 01:21:13.312
I do not want to leave again?

01:21:16.119 --> 01:21:18.547
Tonight you really need to
be taken, can you help me?

01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:24.601
Almost a Miracle, is not it?
Snowing at Christmas.

01:21:26.978 --> 01:21:28.656
Go to the concert?

01:21:28.996 --> 01:21:32.233
-Yes.
-Come with me.

01:21:35.779 --> 01:21:37.877
My father made me swear
that I did not...

01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:39.236
would miss any Christmas concert

01:21:39.566 --> 01:21:42.153
I thought it would be
behind Times Square.

01:21:42.193 --> 01:21:44.680
It was, but everything changes, do not you think?

01:21:46.698 --> 01:21:49.296
<i>"Sir, I want to buy these shoes...</i>

01:21:50.385 --> 01:21:52.832
<i>... For my mother please</i>

01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:58.547
<i>It's Christmas Eve and they
are exactly your number.</i>

01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:03.821
<i>Could you hurry, sir?</i>

01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:07.428
<i>Dad says there's not much time.</i>

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:12.233
<i>You see, she has been
sick for some time</i>

01:22:13.332 --> 01:22:16.029
<i>I know these shoes will make you smile</i>

01:22:16.978 --> 01:22:19.276
<i>And I want it to be beautiful</i>

01:22:20.275 --> 01:22:22.902
<i>I know mom will meet JESUS</i>

01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:25.669
<i>Tonight.</i>

01:22:30.035 --> 01:22:32.962
<i>You can hurry, sir</i>

01:22:33.432 --> 01:22:36.489
<i>Dad says there is not much time</i>

01:22:37.498 --> 01:22:41.494
<i>See you, I want her to look beautiful</i>

01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:45.480
<i>If mom goes to meet JESUS</i>

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.017
<i>tonight!</i>

01:22:49.386 --> 01:22:51.244
I arrived mom!

01:22:52.473 --> 01:22:54.241
Maa!

01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:03.452
I bought you these shoes.

01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:11.613
So you can use them in Heaven.

01:23:27.428 --> 01:23:30.245
These are the most beautiful
shoes I have ever seen.

01:23:35.949 --> 01:23:37.687
Can you place them for me?

01:23:37.727 --> 01:23:39.675
Insurance!

01:24:00.764 --> 01:24:02.472
Thank you!

01:24:06.119 --> 01:24:07.697
Nathan!

01:24:12.502 --> 01:24:14.470
Do not forget...

01:24:26.688 --> 01:24:28.736
My dad loved music...

01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:31.723
...a lot!

01:24:32.243 --> 01:24:34.251
I know you're worried I know you.

01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:37.727
We will be fine!

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:46.309
Do not care anymore!

01:25:16.329 --> 01:25:18.297
Hello Dalton, have you seen Kate?

01:25:19.216 --> 01:25:21.383
It's there!

01:26:32.133 --> 01:26:34.251
I'm sorry about your friend!

01:26:36.548 --> 01:26:38.077
I also.

01:26:42.253 --> 01:26:44.181
This is your husband, ma'am?

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.768
Yes!

01:26:48.067 --> 01:26:51.274
I certainly appreciate all that Mr.
Layton has done for us.

01:26:52.213 --> 01:26:55.020
You know, he's been working
late, and it's very difficult.

01:26:56.139 --> 01:26:59.026
But we would be lost if
it were not for him.

01:27:00.035 --> 01:27:02.163
Your husband has given
us hope this Christmas.

01:27:11.174 --> 01:27:12.842
What happened to you tonight?

01:27:14.081 --> 01:27:16.668
I went to Wilson to pick up the doll...

01:27:17.267 --> 01:27:20.274
Of course, they had already sold it, and then...

01:27:24.091 --> 01:27:26.308
I found that boy.

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:33.242
who showed me how much I love you

01:27:37.068 --> 01:27:38.916
Do not!

01:27:38.956 --> 01:27:40.584
It is true,

01:27:41.283 --> 01:27:42.852
So much!

01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:49.575
To you and Lily.

01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:54.760
And I want you to teach,
you were born to teach.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.707
And I'm not interested in buying the house,
and I do not care if you come back ..

01:27:57.747 --> 01:27:59.885
to school, and I do not
care about anything else.

01:28:03.122 --> 01:28:05.219
I've been so stupid!

01:28:10.684 --> 01:28:12.862
I only want to make you happy.

01:28:16.009 --> 01:28:19.305
You forgive me?

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.028
I already forgive you.

01:29:13.631 --> 01:29:14.790
What do you say?

01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:16.708
Very good!

01:29:17.038 --> 01:29:20.924
-Where are you going, it's three thirty?
-I have to go to a game of Basketball

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:24.500
-Okay coach, give them hard!
-OK!

01:30:07.607 --> 01:30:10.864
<i>Dear Robert, I was remembering
when you were a child,</i>

01:30:11.763 --> 01:30:14.061
<i>You had so much
passion for things.</i>

01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:18.236
<i>you used to talk about the things
you would do when you were big</i>

01:30:19.255 --> 01:30:23.101
<i>I just want to tell you that it does not
matter what difficulties you may face</i>

01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:25.799
<i>GOD is there!</i>

01:30:25.839 --> 01:30:29.585
<i>Maybe, it will be in Lily's
songs, or in Kate's laughter</i>

01:30:29.665 --> 01:30:33.371
<i>In the simplest things, but
if you listen carefully...</i>

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.987
<i>you can hear it</i>

01:30:43.161 --> 01:30:45.139
I miss you, mom!

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.946
Kate is doing it for the best.

01:30:49.935 --> 01:30:51.983
Lily too.

01:30:54.011 --> 01:30:56.768
You would be proud.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.618
He's the first person I see
around here at Christmas...

01:31:06.658 --> 01:31:08.286
...in years

01:31:08.566 --> 01:31:11.033
I was just thinking the same thing

01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:16.478
Well, I have to go, the studios.

01:31:16.828 --> 01:31:19.365
-College?
-Medicine School.

01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:23.021
Merry Christmas

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.850
For you too!

01:31:27.227 --> 01:31:28.806
Nice hat!

01:31:29.715 --> 01:31:31.243
Pretty?

01:31:36.718 --> 01:31:38.936
- Subtitle not translated -

01:31:39.905 --> 01:31:42.502
If you are open to it, small
miracles can change your life.

01:31:43.881 --> 01:31:48.006
The laughter of a child,
a dinner in a pink pot

01:31:49.055 --> 01:31:53.111
A car that needs fixing

01:31:53.501 --> 01:31:55.009
even a pair of shoes.

01:31:56.305 --> 01:32:02.839
