WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.223
-Previously onSEAL Team...
-They're gonna take her alive.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.834
It's the way it must be!

00:08.878 --> 00:11.011
We can't tell you how sorry
we are for your loss.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.404
JASON: We're getting pulled back
to the States tomorrow.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.667
You are leaving us?
You're no warriors.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.582
BLACKBURN: Gentlemen, I realize
your feet have barely touched

00:17.626 --> 00:19.454
the ground here,
but you'll be spinning up.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.499
DAVIS: Your mission remains
a capture/kill of Jamar Yasiri.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.545
Additionally, you will be
gathering any intel

00:23.588 --> 00:26.026
that may help expose
a more powerful entity.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.984
Welcome, hi, come on in.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.986
CLAY: Too many guys get off
of the battlefield believing

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
they'll never shake the things
they've seen and done.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.512
You know, this place
is to help guys like us.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.079
Bravo Team,
what misfortune

00:36.123 --> 00:37.646
have you returned
to inflict upon us?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.126
We came back
to take out Yasiri.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.823
Weeks after his men
killed our commander?

00:40.866 --> 00:43.913
Word is, some of the ISIS
whose compound was destroyed

00:43.956 --> 00:46.089
might know the location
of Yasiri.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.657
Jamar Yasiri, al-Sham Brigade,
do you know this man?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.485
And here, I thought
you were coming to apologize

00:50.528 --> 00:52.313
about the drones that forced me
into this place.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.923
It was Yasiri's drones.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.404
Yasiri is our enemy
just like he's yours.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.449
[gunfire]

01:00.060 --> 01:01.148
Jackpot.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.845
DAVIS: Ray, I need to confirm

01:02.888 --> 01:04.281
that the HVT's laptop
has remained secure

01:04.325 --> 01:05.543
in a Faraday case.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.067
Stay blacked out
until I can ensure

01:07.110 --> 01:08.546
you haven't been compromised.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.939
You figured out where
their weapons came from?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.462
Their weapons, their funding,

01:11.506 --> 01:14.726
it's all coming
from the same place... Iran.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.253
[imam singing prayer]

01:23.518 --> 01:25.346
-MEN: Ah!
-Let's fucking see

01:25.389 --> 01:27.217
what I fucking
hauled in here, huh?

01:27.261 --> 01:30.046
It's the magic.
Here comes the magic.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.875
All right, naming rights
to Sonny's second-born.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.442
-That's right.
-All right.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.835
-A massage from Brock.
-[laughter]

01:36.879 --> 01:39.664
The gift of eternal
enlightenment from Trent.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.058
-You cannot put a price on that.
-No, you cannot.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.365
All right, what'd I miss?
What did I miss?

01:44.408 --> 01:46.584
-JASON: Brock massages.
-[overlapping chatter]

01:46.628 --> 01:48.108
Just another poker night
in purgatory.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.066
Please tell me
that was Command calling

01:50.110 --> 01:51.937
telling us that we're going
back to work.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.114
Because it's been over a week
and I'm starting to go crazy.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.725
No, it was Naima,
just some vet center stuff.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.683
Last I heard from the brass,

01:58.727 --> 02:00.381
they're still trying to wrap
their heads around Iran

02:00.424 --> 02:02.165
being the force
behind al-Sham Brigade.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.645
OMAR: Well, while they wrap
their heads,

02:03.688 --> 02:05.168
we sit on our asses.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.475
Unlike Brock,
DoD's keeping their cards close.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.433
They got no choice.
We make a move that lets Iran

02:09.477 --> 02:11.218
know we're onto 'em,
and things escalate.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.871
OMAR: Shoot it out with
the foot soldiers all you want,

02:12.915 --> 02:14.438
but when you lock onto the top,
it's hold fire.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.092
[clicks tongue]
That part.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.442
Yeah, it's puppet masters
protecting puppet masters.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.183
Nobody wants World War III.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.967
Especially not
the innocent people

02:22.011 --> 02:23.839
under the control
of a reckless regime.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.884
Well, I see Bravo 1

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
still does a mean
Johnny Chan impression.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.149
-Yeah.
-Look at this, huh?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.715
SONNY: Hey, look, look,
anybody else think

02:30.759 --> 02:34.023
that Jason's noggin problems
is just a long con

02:34.066 --> 02:37.766
-to take all our cash?
-[laughter]

02:37.809 --> 02:40.290
Hey, you can laugh,
new guy, it's all right.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.598
Well, you do seem
to be a card shark.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.513
Maybe all those headshots
gave you a beautiful mind.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.254
[laughter]

02:47.297 --> 02:50.561
Whoo, the one good thing
about a week in limbo

02:50.605 --> 02:52.172
is we are one big happy family.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.825
SONNY: I got some side action
for you.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.958
Raise the stakes,
make it a little exciting.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.394
-Okay?
-What's up?

02:57.438 --> 02:59.091
One hand, head-to-head.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.442
-If I win, okay...
-Mm-hmm.

03:01.485 --> 03:02.834
You stop all this crazy talk

03:02.878 --> 03:04.532
about retiring
in a couple months.

03:04.575 --> 03:07.361
Now, that is one time in my life
I will root for Sonny.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.232
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Come on...

03:09.276 --> 03:13.062
I appreciate you, brother,
but I'd rather save my luck

03:13.105 --> 03:14.672
for outside the wire.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.718
Hey, we mix it up with Iran,
we're gonna need it.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.940
â™ª

03:29.905 --> 03:32.603
You realize the discovery
of Iran's involvement

03:32.647 --> 03:35.389
raises a whole minefield
of strategic questions

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
for SOCOM to consider?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.043
RAY: I guess
I'm wondering, sir,

03:38.087 --> 03:39.480
where we fall
in those considerations.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.612
Our last trip here,
we got yanked home

03:41.656 --> 03:43.745
in a heartbeat, and we still
had unfinished business.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.399
Now, our mission's accomplished.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.922
Look, if there's any follow-ons,
let us at 'em, all right?

03:46.965 --> 03:48.402
We're clawing the walls here.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.273
Walls still surrounded
by a dozen enemy groups,

03:50.317 --> 03:52.449
including the remains
of Yasiri's militia,

03:52.493 --> 03:54.277
who can't be happy
their leader got got.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.192
There's no reason to believe
that Bravo is vulnerable

03:56.236 --> 03:58.281
to retaliatory attacks.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.936
The Agency has successfully
pushed the narrative that Yasiri

04:00.979 --> 04:02.590
was taken out by ISIS.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.680
You all are real good at
spinning those lies, aren't you?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.334
Excuse me, Petty Officer?

04:07.377 --> 04:09.510
Now, what happens when
that story of yours falls apart?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.207
We just gonna stay here
and take that hit?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.557
All right, check it, Sonny.
Come on.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.996
Bravo Team will stand by
until further instructed.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.955
Yes, sir.
Roger that.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.826
JASON: Sonny, what the fuck
was that back there?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.437
Why you unloading
on Blackburn like that?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.177
I mean, look, you know,
he's our boy and all,

04:25.221 --> 04:26.831
but he's still
our executive officer.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.616
-You can't do that.
-I know, I'm just getting sick

04:28.659 --> 04:31.575
and tired of this head-shed
horseshit over our Mali op.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.751
Okay, that's top
of the food chain politics

04:33.795 --> 04:35.318
going on right there,
you cannot pin that

04:35.362 --> 04:36.885
on Blackburn or DEVGRU.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.626
All cogs in a corrupt machine.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.323
Whatever they're hiding,
Davis might have dropped,

04:40.367 --> 04:42.238
but I won't, and this ain't
no conspiracy,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.458
Area 51 bullshit, Jas, okay?

04:44.501 --> 04:45.850
Something happened on our op,

04:45.894 --> 04:47.156
and they are trying
to cover it up.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.419
I know, I know.
I know.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.813
I think they're trying
to make me a part of it, too.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.119
What the hell you mean?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.208
I'm up for the Navy Cross
for Mali.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.692
I mean, that run you did saved
all our asses, especially Clay.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
But them giving you that medal
focuses on what you did

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
and not what went wrong.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.698
That's right,
it puts the spotlight on me.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.744
Whatever was rotten, it just
stays in the shadows.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.705
Now, a Navy Cross investigation,

05:14.749 --> 05:17.404
that's gonna span
across your entire career, okay?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.275
They might get wise
to your TBI.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.583
That's not what
I'm worried about.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.019
You know how this works.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.195
Extortion 17,
Roberts Ridge,

05:26.238 --> 05:28.197
all those families trying
to get answers,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.025
and they cannot get the truth.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.158
DoD wants to bury something,
they bury it eight miles deep.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.899
That's why I'm not
gonna stop digging, okay?

05:34.943 --> 05:36.727
And this investigation that
they're gonna do to you,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.381
you don't have shit
to worry about, okay,

05:38.425 --> 05:40.122
'cause the team will have
your back as we always do.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.385
Besides, how many shots
has Bravo 1 taken

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
home and away?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.562
Has one of those shots landed?
No.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.825
I've had plenty of
consequences, Sonny, plenty.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.524
Yeah, look at you now.
You're rolling pretty

05:50.567 --> 05:52.743
with eight and a half
of your nine lives.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.408
SARSFIELD: As galling as we all
find the fact that Tehran

06:05.452 --> 06:08.106
would use a proxy for us
to carry out this attack

06:08.150 --> 06:10.805
on an American vessel,
I'm yet to be presented

06:10.848 --> 06:12.502
with any appropriate response.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.113
RIVAS: Simply no appetite
for open aggression with Iran.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.376
Due respect, Admiral.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.423
We may have a more
specific target.

06:20.467 --> 06:24.601
-More specific?
-Sir, our enemy is one man.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.734
Iranian General
Afshin Rajavi.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.127
Communications with
al-Sham Brigade leadership

06:29.171 --> 06:32.174
show that General Rajavi
was giving them their orders,

06:32.217 --> 06:34.611
supplying weapons,
and personally directed

06:34.655 --> 06:36.308
the attack on the USS Crampton.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.485
General Rajavi is one of
the most highly placed figures

06:38.528 --> 06:39.834
in Tehran.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.226
Why get his hands dirty
with that?

06:41.270 --> 06:43.141
To keep Iran's
plausibly clean, sir,

06:43.185 --> 06:45.883
while he advances their interest
in the region.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.451
Theory is, the use of
Russian missiles in that attack

06:48.495 --> 06:50.366
was an attempt to further pull
our attention

06:50.410 --> 06:52.847
away from the Middle East
toward Moscow.

06:52.890 --> 06:57.068
But that misdirection failed,
drew our SEALs into Syria

06:57.112 --> 07:00.463
and exposed Rajavi as the figure
behind al-Sham Brigade,

07:00.507 --> 07:02.726
a force which has now
been degraded.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.860
-It's a closed loop.
-Except, sir,

07:05.903 --> 07:07.688
the Cramptonattack
was only one salvo

07:07.731 --> 07:09.820
in a campaign
of clandestine operations

07:09.864 --> 07:11.561
Rajavi was waging in the region.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.737
Carried out under his orders
with the full backing

07:13.781 --> 07:16.261
and resources of Iran,
while giving them distance

07:16.305 --> 07:17.915
from the resulting bloodshed.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.657
We'll take a look.
Thank you.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.706
With all due respect, sir,
without action against Rajavi,

07:25.749 --> 07:27.534
we are begging
for another Ukraine,

07:27.577 --> 07:29.318
inviting Iran to launch
an offensive

07:29.361 --> 07:31.494
that will change
the geopolitical landscape

07:31.538 --> 07:32.887
for a generation.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.281
Our chance to stop that is now.
It's him.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.155
We are not venturing
into a sovereign nation

07:40.198 --> 07:41.852
to eliminate a sitting general.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.203
If Rajavi is as hands-on
with these global actions

07:45.247 --> 07:48.642
as it sounds,
he must travel quite a bit.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.471
Stands to reason, sir.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.040
If someone can find
an angle of attack on him

07:56.084 --> 08:00.871
outside Iranian borders without
implicating U.S. forces,

08:00.915 --> 08:03.657
I can see greenlighting
action on him.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.093
Yes, sir.

08:13.797 --> 08:17.322
[door opens and closes]

08:18.498 --> 08:20.891
You rub on that thing enough,
maybe the op genie appears,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.458
grants us some action.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.287
[sighs]

08:25.330 --> 08:27.071
Jas, you know Sonny
getting salty with Command

08:27.115 --> 08:28.943
is not gonna make them
any quicker to task us

08:28.986 --> 08:32.555
-or bring us home.
-I talked to him.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.514
You got his ass screwed back
in the right direction?

08:35.776 --> 08:37.691
I just realized
mine hasn't been.

08:39.388 --> 08:44.915
You know, I've just been looking
over my shoulder so much,

08:44.959 --> 08:50.834
decommissioning, Omar,
medal investigation.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.273
First two storms have passed.
You'll weather the next one.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.319
Right, I'll walk away just fine,

08:57.362 --> 08:59.582
when Clay, Hamal,
and Commander Nouri didn't.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.889
You've taken your share
of damage too, brother.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.587
Right, and I got
to move on every time,

09:04.631 --> 09:07.851
while Clay is just stuck
living in his.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.464
Jas, there's a big difference
between living in your hurt

09:12.508 --> 09:13.988
and living with it.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.816
Now, Clay, he's doing great.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.426
He's at the center every day
paying forward

09:17.469 --> 09:18.775
the support that you gave him.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.126
I don't need
a cheerleader, Ray.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.652
Sure.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.001
You need a target.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.570
Downtime's nobody's friend.

09:36.271 --> 09:39.448
All right.
I'll leave you to it.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.198
Hey, Ben.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.156
We missed you
at the group session, man.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.941
Two of our guys discovered
they both got injured

09:53.984 --> 09:55.507
during Operation Iron Harvest.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.509
Touching.
I can't wait to hear

09:57.553 --> 09:59.903
what happens on the next episode
of Cry Coach.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.470
Yo, hey.
You good?

10:01.513 --> 10:02.993
Naima told me that you missed
your appointment

10:03.037 --> 10:04.255
with the V.A. yesterday.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.127
I'm exhausted.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.172
I thought sleeping in a bed here
instead of my truck

10:08.216 --> 10:09.783
would have helped.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.349
You still looking for that sleep
without a nightmare?

10:11.393 --> 10:12.699
Nightmares are easier
to handle than reality

10:12.742 --> 10:13.917
when I'm lying awake
at 2:00 a.m.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.919
wondering where I go from here.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.139
Well, that career counselor
have any leads for you?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.837
Facilities maintenance
at Fort Lee

10:20.881 --> 10:22.491
or Air Station Oceana.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.537
Thought Top Gun was cool,
wait till you see the guys

10:25.581 --> 10:27.235
that fix those guys' shitters.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.672
Look, hey, you-- do you ever
think about just, like,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.500
trying something
completely new?

10:31.543 --> 10:34.895
Like going to school, or just
try leaving the military behind?

10:34.938 --> 10:36.592
Just let 'em off the hook?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.987
-What do you mean?
-They did this to me.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.380
I walked into that
Air Force recruiting office

10:42.424 --> 10:46.254
gaslit by all that "Aim high,
fly, fight, win" bullshit.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.691
Well, I never got
off the fucking ground,

10:48.735 --> 10:51.085
fought dirty, and I've been
losing ever since.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.565
Air Force broke me.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.002
It's on them to put me
back together,

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
start with a job.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.353
Look, the military
is a lot better at breaking us

10:58.396 --> 10:59.963
than it is fixing us.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.878
Maybe that's why it's best
for you just to cut ties,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.793
you know, just try
and move on with your life.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.621
Yeah, from the guy
who gave 'em a leg

11:05.665 --> 11:07.536
and still lurks around base
begging for more.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.021
I got a fresh box
of coffin nails

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
screaming to be smoked.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.851
See ya.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.504
Hey, hey.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.508
Look, 2:00 a.m. hits hard.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.120
You got my number.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.916
OMAR: Yo, we catch anything
from Command?

11:39.960 --> 11:44.138
-Ah, crickets.
-Too bad.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.183
Bravo seems to prefer
chaos to calm.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.794
Jason especially.
[sighs]

11:47.837 --> 11:49.839
Yeah, well, Bravo 1
can't have a one-track mind

11:49.883 --> 11:51.580
-outside the wire.
-Huh.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.758
What do you do when he gets
frustrated like this?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.151
You know, I worked
with team leaders

11:57.194 --> 11:58.543
who want an ego massage,

11:58.587 --> 12:00.241
others who want
a drinking buddy,

12:00.284 --> 12:02.025
others who wanna be left
the fuck alone.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.505
Oh.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.986
You're looking for
the Jason Hayes

12:06.029 --> 12:07.683
2IC user manual, huh?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.990
At least the "don't feed
after midnight" bullet points,

12:10.033 --> 12:12.209
while you're still around.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.776
Fair enough.

12:13.820 --> 12:18.868
Um... yeah, usually,
he just needs, you know,

12:18.912 --> 12:21.479
time and space to shark around.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.005
Hard part is knowing when
there's a deeper problem.

12:25.048 --> 12:28.573
I mean, the guy's endured
as much loss as any Frogman.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.708
-He seems to manage it.
-Better now than ever.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.449
I mean, part of me
still worries that

12:34.492 --> 12:37.582
that next blow will break
that dam of trauma inside him.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.410
Yeah, how do you help
prevent that?

12:41.108 --> 12:42.849
[sighs]
Well, the truth is,

12:42.892 --> 12:45.242
for the past year Clay's done
most of the heavy lifting.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
I mean, he's the one
that woke Jason up

12:46.853 --> 12:47.984
to his head issues.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.160
Didn't back down
when it got ugly.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.208
He put Jason on the path
to healing.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.386
You know,
whatever you take from me,

12:58.429 --> 13:00.562
you should take some
from Clay, too.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.131
Do not be afraid
to call Bravo 1 out.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.308
[sucks teeth]
Okay.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.744
So, I just gotta do the job

13:08.788 --> 13:10.572
of two of the best Frogmen
in DEVGRU.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.139
Easy fucking day.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.749
I'm glad we're on
the same page.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.490
[both laughing]

13:15.533 --> 13:17.274
Yo, I'm gonna get back
to this work, but...

13:17.318 --> 13:18.798
I'll catch you later.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.498
Ma'am?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.329
Latest SIGINT from Syrian
extremists shows an uptick

13:28.372 --> 13:30.026
in the questioning
of Yasiri's death

13:30.070 --> 13:32.420
and whether it was actually
at the hands of ISIS.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.118
Might just be more noise than
signal at this point, but...

13:35.162 --> 13:38.469
Our cover story's unraveling.
Okay, we need to work faster.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.602
Where are we on
General Rajavi's travel history?

13:40.645 --> 13:42.734
Documented appearances
in Beirut, Baghdad,

13:42.778 --> 13:44.562
Aleppo, and Northern Yemen
over the past two months.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.782
Did we have any advance
indications of those visits?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.915
We need to turn where he's been
into where he's going.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.394
Retrospective analysis

13:50.438 --> 13:52.048
doesn't show any pattern
to project forward.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.529
Rajavi's meticulous about
switching up aircrafts,

13:54.572 --> 13:56.879
changing residences,
leaving zero footprints.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.707
Financials show any chink
in the armor?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.622
Any personal spending patterns?

14:00.665 --> 14:01.884
Negative,
financials all seem to go

14:01.928 --> 14:03.277
through the same murky channels

14:03.320 --> 14:04.844
that bankroll the weapons
and fighters.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.237
Hang on.
What's this here?

14:10.762 --> 14:14.418
DAVIS: His name is Reza Khoi.
He's the head of Karaj Capital,

14:14.462 --> 14:16.507
a multinational
financial services firm

14:16.551 --> 14:18.161
based in Iran.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.642
The funds used for
General Rajavi's global attacks

14:20.685 --> 14:21.948
all go through this man.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.606
Khoi's grip on
General Rajavi's war chest

14:28.650 --> 14:30.652
suggest that he's also aware
of his movements.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.915
And unlike Rajavi,
we know that Khoi

14:32.959 --> 14:34.351
is currently out of Iran

14:34.395 --> 14:35.657
working from his
corporate office

14:35.700 --> 14:37.311
in Amman, Jordan.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.878
Potential special activities op?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.792
If Bravo can get close to Khoi,

14:40.836 --> 14:43.230
hack into his communications
with Rajavi,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.885
it could reveal
an opportune time and place

14:45.928 --> 14:47.408
that the general
will be vulnerable.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.948
â™ª

15:12.999 --> 15:15.305
Bravo 3, this is 1,
looks like HVT's clocking out

15:15.349 --> 15:16.916
for the night.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.962
It's past 11:00.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.921
Whatever happened
to banker's hours?

15:23.139 --> 15:24.532
Khoi's gotta
roll his sleeves up,

15:24.575 --> 15:26.577
run a legit brokerage
and launder cash

15:26.621 --> 15:28.753
for General Rajavi's
world tour of terror.

15:28.797 --> 15:31.408
We swap the rubble of Syria
for the bright lights of Amman,

15:31.452 --> 15:33.062
still end up in the dust.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.716
Look, no one's getting
comfortable here, all right?

15:34.759 --> 15:38.502
Davis says that Khoi
is flying out tomorrow night

15:38.546 --> 15:39.982
to some conference
in Shanghai.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.505
China's a no-go for us.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.464
And our cover story
for the Yasiri hit

15:43.507 --> 15:44.900
won't hold much longer.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.293
Rajavi's gonna get wise
to the fact

15:46.336 --> 15:47.642
that we're onto him soon.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.818
Security Khoi
rolls with here,

15:49.861 --> 15:51.994
getting within hacking range
of his tech is no easy feat.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.822
Doing a pattern of life
to find a security lapse

15:53.865 --> 15:56.694
-could take weeks.
-We got hours.

15:56.738 --> 16:00.611
The clock's ticking.
Clock is ticking, boys.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.495
[groaning] What's the word
from this damn mountaintop?

16:14.538 --> 16:17.759
Hey, your recon from last night
indicate we can get close

16:17.802 --> 16:20.196
-to Khoi at his residence?
-Filthy with security.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.156
A laser-beam shark
short of Dr. Evil's volcano.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.984
Which means the best shot
we have

16:25.027 --> 16:27.464
at tapping this guy's data
is when he's in his office.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.813
Yeah, his need to look legit

16:28.857 --> 16:30.163
means he's got less
firepower around.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.599
Plus the building's got
other businesses

16:31.642 --> 16:33.122
in the lower floors.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.689
Gives us cover to work
our way up to Khoi's.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.430
You know, the vacant office
right above his

16:36.473 --> 16:38.562
should be within range to use
a sniffer on his Wi-Fi.

16:38.606 --> 16:39.911
We could rip his laptop,

16:39.955 --> 16:41.261
shouldn't take more
than ten minutes.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.219
Less firepower around,
what's that mean?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.786
Three to four guards
roaming Khoi's floors,

16:44.829 --> 16:46.353
all wearing the same gray suits.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.615
I haven't had time
to nail down their patterns.

16:47.658 --> 16:48.877
Which we won't have.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.661
Command made it very clear

16:50.705 --> 16:52.576
that this has to happen today,
right?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.230
So, we sit on the bench
for a week in Syria,

16:54.274 --> 16:55.579
and now they're in a rush,

16:55.623 --> 16:57.277
so we gotta do it
quick and dangerous?

16:57.320 --> 16:58.626
All right, look, why do you got
the bug up your ass

16:58.669 --> 17:00.280
about accountability,
Sonny, huh?

17:00.323 --> 17:02.064
Remember, all right,
we're going after the dirtbag

17:02.108 --> 17:03.761
who took out
20 American sailors, okay?

17:03.805 --> 17:06.242
-So, dial it the fuck in.
-Roger that.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.516
Khoi's punching in.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.652
All right.
Hey, let's go to work.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.052
[indistinct chatter]

17:59.078 --> 18:00.775
Sweaty in business casual.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.517
I built my whole life
around avoiding this.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.693
Yeah. Come on.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.931
â™ª

18:35.288 --> 18:37.333
â™ª

19:00.313 --> 19:02.141
Sniffer's not finding
Khoi's network.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.014
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.321
Is the HVT still in his office,
laptop on?

19:11.889 --> 19:14.022
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1,
do you copy?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
Bravo 3, this is Mako 1,
do you copy?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.594
[static crackles]

19:20.637 --> 19:22.248
Might all be part
of the same problem.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.467
Hold here.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.904
-I'll be right back.
-I'll keep trying.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.091
1, do you copy?

19:44.487 --> 19:45.793
1, do you copy?

19:47.838 --> 19:48.926
Mako.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.538
Say again, 1.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.061
You're broken,
but you're readable.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.194
-What's up?
-We have a problem here.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.152
Seems that we're up against
some type of signal jammer.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.632
It's disrupting comms
and other tech.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.895
We can try workarounds
with the computer,

20:00.938 --> 20:03.071
but we'll still
be in the cone of silence.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.334
Can you hold it where you are?

20:05.378 --> 20:08.250
Negative.
Too far away from 4.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.121
If a gray suit pops out
of that stairwell near him,

20:10.165 --> 20:11.471
he's screwed.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.907
If you go back
to the office,

20:12.950 --> 20:14.517
you're both working blind.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.653
I'll stick with my brother.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.090
I'm heading back in.
We'll work quick, going dark.

20:32.579 --> 20:33.971
SONNY: I don't like 'em
being in there

20:34.015 --> 20:35.843
with no eyes and ears.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.522
Especially when them
gray jackets

21:02.565 --> 21:04.045
are getting stirred up
about something.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.699
[siren whooping]

21:05.742 --> 21:08.571
Might have to do with that.
Check out the street.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.312
[siren continues whooping]

21:13.359 --> 21:15.448
[siren whooping]

21:15.491 --> 21:16.710
Hey.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.029
What's this?

21:33.248 --> 21:34.510
It's the VIP.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.513
More guards in the mix.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.080
[elevator dings]

21:39.123 --> 21:40.864
SONNY: Bravo 1, this is 3.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.649
Security's doing a sweep
and making their way

21:42.692 --> 21:45.260
up to our guys' pos.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.175
-Do you copy?
-Copy.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.092
-What's the move?
-You stay here.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.835
I'm going up.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.231
[elevator dings]

22:17.640 --> 22:20.208

22:23.472 --> 22:25.213
Work trip, yeah.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.477
Dry heat, my ass, right?

22:32.438 --> 22:35.005
[speaking foreign language]

22:45.015 --> 22:46.495
Come on, Jas.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.454
Still not getting through.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.238
We're running out of options.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.723
Hey.
We need to move.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.333
Now. Let's go.

23:03.077 --> 23:05.122
â™ª

23:28.102 --> 23:29.451
Get what we're after?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.845
-Not even close.
-Just lucky to get out.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.682
[Jason sighs]

23:45.772 --> 23:47.295
SONNY: I take it
you two corporate raiders

23:47.338 --> 23:48.688
didn't close the deal.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.211
RAY: Khoi's got a firewall
around him,

23:50.254 --> 23:51.821
we couldn't even tap
into his damn network.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.215
SONNY: Oh, and that puts us
absolutely nowhere.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.825
Tell you what, man,
why don't we go to Petra

23:55.869 --> 23:58.045
and make something of this
godforsaken trip?

23:58.088 --> 24:00.656
-Yo, we might not be nowhere.
-What's that mean?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.658
So, I overheard the two guards
running their mouths

24:02.702 --> 24:04.486
in the elevator
through Jason's open comms.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.357
Khoi's guy mentioned
accompanying his boss

24:06.401 --> 24:08.359
to an event tonight
at the Amman Citadel

24:08.403 --> 24:10.144
before they head to China.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.841
And it looks like it'll be
one hell of a party.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.496
Booze, women--
maybe his defenses come down.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.019
If we get close to him there,

24:16.063 --> 24:17.717
maybe we can take a swing
at cloning his phone

24:17.760 --> 24:19.414
-before he gets on his flight.
-Aw, man, the phone's

24:19.458 --> 24:21.198
probably just as hack-proofed
as the computer is.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.030
[sighs]

24:27.074 --> 24:29.119
Hold on, you know,
the route between the party

24:29.163 --> 24:31.165
and the airport, there's a lot
of dead spaces here.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.514
-What's that mean?
-What does it mean?

24:32.558 --> 24:33.950
You know what,
we got one last shot

24:33.994 --> 24:35.952
of getting this guy Khoi
before he vanishes.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.824
Now, the scalpel,
it's not working--

24:37.867 --> 24:39.521
too delicate with this guy.
Gotta drop the hammer,

24:39.565 --> 24:40.957
get the guy himself.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.829
Jason, we don't need Khoi,
we need his data.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.005
Well, how far did that get us?
Got us nowhere, okay?

24:45.048 --> 24:46.920
Phone's out.
Forget the phone.

24:46.963 --> 24:50.140
Okay, Khoi leaves the shindig,
middle of the night,

24:50.184 --> 24:52.491
one of those dead zones,
vehicle interdiction.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.275
JASON: We smash and grab
this motherfucker

24:54.318 --> 24:56.016
and squeeze him for all
he knows about the general.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.757
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You're making it sound

24:57.800 --> 24:59.367
like we're not talking
a dozen variables

24:59.410 --> 25:00.629
that could spell disaster, Jas.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.283
Khoi's guards,
they're no joke.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.111
The vehicle's up-armored,
and we got, what,

25:04.154 --> 25:06.243
eight hours
before this party kicks off?

25:06.287 --> 25:08.245
-Come on.
-So, let's get to work.

25:08.289 --> 25:11.205
Certain factors took the op
out of Bravo's control,

25:11.248 --> 25:12.772
but their team leader
has informed me

25:12.815 --> 25:14.643
they're exploring
alternate avenues.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.253
Excellent work, everyone.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.213
Can I speak to you privately?

25:24.958 --> 25:27.351
-[door closes]
-My team busted their asses

25:27.395 --> 25:28.701
to get Bravo
to the 10-yard line,

25:28.744 --> 25:29.963
and then Bravo fumbled it.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.530
Didn't seem
like that long ago

25:31.573 --> 25:33.401
that Bravo was your team,
win or lose.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.142
The boulder that I pushed
up a hill

25:35.185 --> 25:37.361
to send them back to Syria,
to get the brass

25:37.405 --> 25:40.103
zeroed in on Rajavi, it cannot
come rolling back down.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.801
There's too much riding on it.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.676
What other avenues
are they pursuing?

25:50.723 --> 25:54.378
Jason had me reach out
to a mutual contact in the area.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.164
Jordanian American, former OGA
who can pull some strings

25:57.207 --> 25:59.732
to facilitate
a second run on Khoi.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.386
Well, what help do they need
with another data extraction?

26:02.430 --> 26:05.520
They've pivoted
to apprehending Khoi himself.

26:05.564 --> 26:10.917
Details beyond that,
I trust them enough not to ask.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.222
Then I will.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.445
What happens when General
Rajavi's money man vanishes?

26:17.488 --> 26:19.186
He will know
we are hunting him

26:19.229 --> 26:21.188
and he will go even deeper
underground.

26:22.842 --> 26:27.934
Right now, all I am focused on
is pulling for Bravo's success.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.283
Understood?

26:31.198 --> 26:32.286
Yes, sir.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.813
-Spiking the punch.
-JASON: Copy, 3.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.423
Sonny's on the way
to plant the kill switch

28:06.467 --> 28:08.295
on Khoi's vehicle.

28:08.338 --> 28:11.211
Your Jordanian buddy delivered,
getting him into that party.

28:11.254 --> 28:14.910
Sure did. A hell of a lot easier
for him to scam some tickets

28:14.954 --> 28:17.652
into the party than getting
this fucking bird.

28:19.045 --> 28:22.570
So, HVT hits the road,
they'll kill the engine,

28:22.613 --> 28:25.268
we'll swoop in and do
an air-to-ground interdiction.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.837
It sounds simple.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.926
Yeah.
Let's hope.

Yeah. Oh.

get back to the party.

in your head?

She's good, yeah.
What about yours?

What is it?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.002
I'm, uh...

30:32.004 --> 30:34.267
I don't think I wanna go back
to Green Team.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.490
What do you mean?
Do...

30:41.840 --> 30:43.450
Do you wanna go back
to operating?

30:48.194 --> 30:51.153
If we weren't anchored here,
where would you wanna go?

30:52.807 --> 30:56.115
Like, if you could pursue
whatever you wanted, wherever,

30:56.158 --> 30:57.551
raise Brian anywhere?

30:57.594 --> 30:59.292
[chuckles]
Why?

30:59.335 --> 31:01.381
Because so much of our life
has just been about me.

31:01.424 --> 31:04.166
You know, my job,
my schedule, my struggles.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.081
Mm-mm, no, no, no.
They're ours.

-Come on, writer.
-I'm serious.

31:23.272 --> 31:29.975
Um, I teach and I work
on my novel,

31:30.018 --> 31:31.628
which is, of course, brilliant,

31:31.672 --> 31:34.022
but still very much
best-seller accessible.

31:36.024 --> 31:40.681
And the three of us,
we go on a walk

31:40.724 --> 31:44.380
every sunset on the beach.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.384
Yeah.
If you're asking.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.604
I am.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.694
Look, I've been talking to Ash

31:53.737 --> 31:55.652
about picking our TBI crusade
back up,

31:55.696 --> 31:57.959
but I can do that from anywhere.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
You're actually serious?

32:00.005 --> 32:02.311
[both chuckle]

wanted to stop surprising you.

-It's Ben.
-Go ahead.

-[clears throat]
-Hey, Ben, what's up?

32:19.154 --> 32:20.503
Clay, need your help here.

32:20.547 --> 32:21.983
Yo, what's going on, man?
Where are you?

Behind the strip mall
in Hampton,

Highway 6 and Temple.
Can you come?

Hey, hey, well,
slow down, slow down.

-What is it?
-I don't know.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.088
He sounded frantic.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.134
Well, you said he was spinning
last time you saw him.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.180
Yeah.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.358
Maybe I should go check on him.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.884
Sure.

32:56.496 --> 32:58.150
All right,
I'll be back soon, okay?

32:59.325 --> 33:00.717
-Love you.
-Love you.

-[string quartet playing]

33:13.687 --> 33:17.734
Okay, I'll be hearing
from you tomorrow. Thank you.

Bravo, stand by.

HVT is boarding
a private helicopter.

34:05.434 --> 34:08.220
I say again, he is leaving
by air, not ground.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.620
Mako 1, HVT's bird,

34:17.664 --> 34:19.274
does it have a HeloSAT
or an antenna?

34:20.101 --> 34:22.451
RAY: It's a HeloSAT.
Why, what are you thinking?

34:22.495 --> 34:26.064
I'm thinking we kill the comms
before we do an interdiction.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.154
1, say again, interdict?

34:29.197 --> 34:30.503
Yeah, we're gonna do
a helo-to-helo interdiction.

34:30.546 --> 34:31.852
The hell did he just say?

34:31.895 --> 34:33.288
1, I don't see that
as an option.

34:33.332 --> 34:35.116

follow vehicle trail us.

37:17.017 --> 37:19.062
They're not responding.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.455
This'll get their attention.

37:21.413 --> 37:22.979
[gunshots]

37:32.293 --> 37:33.816
They're putting down.

37:53.053 --> 37:56.274
â™ª

38:17.338 --> 38:19.949
[gunfire]

38:30.830 --> 38:32.875
[engine rumbling]

38:54.462 --> 38:56.508
[crickets chirping]

39:13.394 --> 39:14.830
What are you doing?

39:17.442 --> 39:18.617
You actually came.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.751
Air Force Recruitment Center.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.753
This where you enlisted?

39:24.797 --> 39:26.799
The scene of the crime.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.409
Your ninja skills
help me get in there,

39:28.453 --> 39:30.150
we can do to their office
what they did to me.

39:30.193 --> 39:31.760
-You don't wanna do that.
-You told me

39:31.804 --> 39:33.414
I should cut ties
with the service.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.503
Can't just walk away,

39:35.547 --> 39:37.592
let some other kid
get suckered in there.

39:39.725 --> 39:42.380
Torching this place might
actually do some fucking good,

39:42.423 --> 39:44.033
and redeem me for all
the blood on my hands.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.426
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

39:46.732 --> 39:48.255
You trying to get caught?

39:49.822 --> 39:52.607
Let's go someplace else,
we can talk this through.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.566
There's security patrol
right down the way, man.

39:54.609 --> 39:57.090
If you're not here to help,
fuck off.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.223
This is only gonna
mess your life up even worse.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.965
What you're fighting through
right now,

40:03.009 --> 40:04.967
this isn't gonna fix it.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.711
Mm, you're probably right.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.801
It won't fix me.

40:12.845 --> 40:16.022
Nothing will at this point.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.939
-That's not true.
-Oh, yes, it is.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.204
My life already ended here
at one point.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.728
Don't need to stick around...

40:26.772 --> 40:29.165
to see it happen again.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.958
-You fucking pulled it off.
-It's not over yet.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.612
Sonny, check it.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.570
Hey, turn him.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.573
-Let's talk.
-You're a businessman,

40:45.617 --> 40:47.140
so you know how this deal goes.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.968
Give us the intel we need,
this stays smooth.

40:49.011 --> 40:50.883
Or you're gonna feel the pain
of us getting it out of you.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.322
What is it I can do
for the American government

40:55.365 --> 40:57.455
to go back to my evening,
gentlemen?

40:57.498 --> 41:00.240
General Rajavi,
you handle his finances.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.329
You know when and where
we can find him outside Iran.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.026
All of my thriving
business interests,

41:04.070 --> 41:06.289
and that nasty rumor is the one
you want to discuss?

41:06.333 --> 41:08.640
I would be remiss
not to loop in my attorneys.

41:08.683 --> 41:10.511
Do you think a mid-air chase
and your two dead guards

41:10.555 --> 41:12.339
was a warm-up to getting
your lawyers involved?

41:12.382 --> 41:14.080
Rajavi, when and where?

41:14.123 --> 41:15.690
Or they're gonna find
your fucking body

41:15.734 --> 41:18.650
in a burning chopper.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.522
I'm afraid those mid-air
theatrics were all for naught.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.350
Great, strap him in.
Burn the fucker.

41:24.569 --> 41:25.744
-Douse it.
-KHOI: All right.

41:25.787 --> 41:28.921
-Come on.
-All right, all right.

41:32.315 --> 41:34.404
I may have heard that Mr. Rajavi

41:34.448 --> 41:36.058
will be traveling
three days from now.

41:37.233 --> 41:41.020
-Where?
-Blasim Airfield, Mosul, Iraq.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.588
If you need more than my word,

41:43.631 --> 41:45.981
my phone is in
my inner left pocket.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.029
Uses retinal scan.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.641
-[phone chirps]
-Check it.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.991
All the verification
you will need is in there.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.645
Yeah, well, we're gonna
hold onto you

41:57.689 --> 42:00.605
-until we can confirm that.
-Then what happens to me?

42:00.648 --> 42:02.215
Better than what's gonna happen
to the general.

42:02.258 --> 42:04.522
Stuff him in the fucking truck.

42:14.401 --> 42:16.664
-Just put the fucking gun down.
-Go!

42:16.708 --> 42:18.274
Look, I'm not leaving you, okay?

42:18.318 --> 42:20.146
-This isn't the answer.
-You said so yourself.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.844
Military and politicians ain't
gonna put us back together.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.021
Maybe this'll wake 'em up.

42:27.022 --> 42:29.068
Look, my-- my buddy
shot himself four years ago

42:29.111 --> 42:31.287
in the V.A. parking lot.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.507
You think it made a difference?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.640
I'm not letting you
follow in his footsteps.

42:35.683 --> 42:37.816
Look, the only thing
that the American war machine

42:37.859 --> 42:39.382
has proven that it's capable of

42:39.426 --> 42:41.341
is chewing up and spitting out
its war fighters.

42:41.384 --> 42:43.343
But we gotta stay in the fight.

42:43.386 --> 42:46.346
I told you,
our war is over.

42:47.782 --> 42:49.610
-It's over.
-Maybe.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.046
â™ª A cold arm...â™ª

42:51.090 --> 42:52.918
But guys like you
are worth fighting for.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.228
I went from being considered
one of the biggest badasses

42:59.272 --> 43:01.056
on the planet to an object
of pity at work

43:01.100 --> 43:02.623
and a threat at home.

43:02.667 --> 43:04.451
And it put me
right where you are weeks ago.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.323
I had a rifle, a spot
picked out in the woods,

43:07.367 --> 43:08.890
I didn't see a path back.

43:08.934 --> 43:10.892
And then someone found me,
and they led me out.

43:13.895 --> 43:15.593
Wish I had teammates like that.

43:15.636 --> 43:17.203
This fucking war
is in its third decade.

43:17.246 --> 43:19.335
Man, guys like us,
we're not alone.

43:19.379 --> 43:21.642
[crying]

43:21.686 --> 43:25.515
Maybe that's why I was saved,
so I could be here for you.

43:26.952 --> 43:28.693
Your brother.

43:28.736 --> 43:30.477
You really think
that's how this shit works?

43:30.520 --> 43:32.827
I don't know, man,
there's gotta be some point

43:32.871 --> 43:34.873
to all of it, right?

43:36.526 --> 43:38.398
I'll help you find it.

43:39.878 --> 43:42.489
Hey, look at me.

43:42.532 --> 43:45.100
â™ª Hey, you are alone...â™ª

43:45.144 --> 43:47.015
Just give me the gun.

43:47.059 --> 43:50.671
â™ª You are aloneâ™ª

43:55.676 --> 43:59.811
â™ª I read it in the paperâ™ª

43:59.854 --> 44:02.378
[sobbing]

44:02.422 --> 44:05.338
â™ª

44:08.907 --> 44:10.386
[continues sobbing]

44:10.430 --> 44:14.869
â™ª Hey, you are aloneâ™ª

44:14.913 --> 44:18.830
â™ª You are aloneâ™ª

44:18.873 --> 44:22.268
Thanks, for looking out for me.

44:22.311 --> 44:24.226
Easy day.

44:24.270 --> 44:26.315
MAN: Security!

44:26.359 --> 44:29.144
[gunshots]

44:29.188 --> 44:35.455
â™ª I've been silent and stoicâ™ª

44:39.589 --> 44:46.596
â™ª Crazy, I denied you soâ™ª

44:54.039 --> 45:00.828
â™ª Sing another song.â™ª
