-They're gonna take her alive.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.834
It's the way it must be!

00:08.878 --> 00:11.011
We can't tell you how sorry
we are for your loss.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.404
JASON: We're getting pulled back
to the States tomorrow.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.667
You are leaving us?
You're no warriors.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.582
BLACKBURN: Gentlemen, I realize
your feet have barely touched

00:17.626 --> 00:19.454
the ground here,
but you'll be spinning up.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.499
DAVIS: Your mission remains
a capture/kill of Jamar Yasiri.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.545
Additionally, you will be
gathering any intel

00:23.588 --> 00:26.026
that may help expose
a more powerful entity.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.984
Welcome, hi, come on in.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.986
CLAY: Too many guys get off
of the battlefield believing

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
they'll never shake the things
they've seen and done.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.512
You know, this place
is to help guys like us.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.079
Bravo Team,
what misfortune

00:36.123 --> 00:37.646
have you returned
to inflict upon us?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.126
We came back
to take out Yasiri.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.823
Weeks after his men
killed our commander?

00:40.866 --> 00:43.913
Word is, some of the ISIS
whose compound was destroyed

00:43.956 --> 00:46.089
might know the location
of Yasiri.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.657
Jamar Yasiri, al-Sham Brigade,
do you know this man?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.485
And here, I thought
you were coming to apologize

00:50.528 --> 00:52.313
about the drones that forced me
into this place.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.923
It was Yasiri's drones.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.404
Yasiri is our enemy
just like he's yours.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.449
[gunfire]

01:00.060 --> 01:01.148

01:01.191 --> 01:02.845
DAVIS: Ray, I need to confirm

01:02.888 --> 01:04.281
that the HVT's laptop
has remained secure

01:04.325 --> 01:05.543
in a Faraday case.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.067
Stay blacked out
until I can ensure

01:07.110 --> 01:08.546
you haven't been compromised.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.939
You figured out where
their weapons came from?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.462
Their weapons, their funding,

01:11.506 --> 01:14.726
it's all coming
from the same place... Iran.

what I fucking
hauled in here, huh?

01:27.261 --> 01:30.046
It's the magic.
Here comes the magic.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.875
All right, naming rights
to Sonny's second-born.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.442
-That's right.
-All right.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.835
-A massage from Brock.
-[laughter]

01:36.879 --> 01:39.664
The gift of eternal
enlightenment from Trent.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.058
-You cannot put a price on that.
-No, you cannot.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.365
All right, what'd I miss?
What did I miss?

01:44.408 --> 01:46.584
-JASON: Brock massages.
-[overlapping chatter]

01:46.628 --> 01:48.108
Just another poker night
in purgatory.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.066
Please tell me
that was Command calling

01:50.110 --> 01:51.937
telling us that we're going
back to work.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.114
Because it's been over a week
and I'm starting to go crazy.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.725
No, it was Naima,
just some vet center stuff.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.683
Last I heard from the brass,

01:58.727 --> 02:00.381
they're still trying to wrap
their heads around Iran

02:00.424 --> 02:02.165
being the force
behind al-Sham Brigade.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.645
OMAR: Well, while they wrap
their heads,

02:03.688 --> 02:05.168
we sit on our asses.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.475
Unlike Brock,
DoD's keeping their cards close.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.433
They got no choice.
We make a move that lets Iran

02:09.477 --> 02:11.218
know we're onto 'em,
and things escalate.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.871
OMAR: Shoot it out with
the foot soldiers all you want,

02:12.915 --> 02:14.438
but when you lock onto the top,
it's hold fire.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.092
[clicks tongue]
That part.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.442
Yeah, it's puppet masters
protecting puppet masters.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.183
Nobody wants World War III.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.967
Especially not
the innocent people

02:22.011 --> 02:23.839
under the control
of a reckless regime.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.884
Well, I see Bravo 1

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
still does a mean
Johnny Chan impression.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.149
-Yeah.
-Look at this, huh?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.715
SONNY: Hey, look, look,
anybody else think

02:30.759 --> 02:34.023
that Jason's noggin problems

Well, you do seem
to be a card shark.

gave you a beautiful mind.

02:47.297 --> 02:50.561
Whoo, the one good thing
about a week in limbo

02:50.605 --> 02:52.172
is we are one big happy family.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.825
SONNY: I got some side action
for you.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.958
Raise the stakes,
make it a little exciting.

-What's up?

-Mm-hmm.

03:01.485 --> 03:02.834
You stop all this crazy talk

03:02.878 --> 03:04.532
about retiring
in a couple months.

03:04.575 --> 03:07.361
Now, that is one time in my life
I will root for Sonny.

for outside the wire.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.718
Hey, we mix it up with Iran,
we're gonna need it.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.940
♪

03:29.905 --> 03:32.603
You realize the discovery
of Iran's involvement

03:32.647 --> 03:35.389
raises a whole minefield
of strategic questions

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
for SOCOM to consider?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.043
RAY: I guess
I'm wondering, sir,

03:38.087 --> 03:39.480
where we fall
in those considerations.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.612
Our last trip here,
we got yanked home

03:41.656 --> 03:43.745
in a heartbeat, and we still
had unfinished business.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.399
Now, our mission's accomplished.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.922
Look, if there's any follow-ons,
let us at 'em, all right?

03:46.965 --> 03:48.402
We're clawing the walls here.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.273
Walls still surrounded
by a dozen enemy groups,

03:50.317 --> 03:52.449
including the remains
of Yasiri's militia,

03:52.493 --> 03:54.277
who can't be happy
their leader got got.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.192
There's no reason to believe
that Bravo is vulnerable

03:56.236 --> 03:58.281
to retaliatory attacks.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.936
The Agency has successfully
pushed the narrative that Yasiri

04:00.979 --> 04:02.590
was taken out by ISIS.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.680
You all are real good at
spinning those lies, aren't you?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.334
Excuse me, Petty Officer?

04:07.377 --> 04:09.510
Now, what happens when
that story of yours falls apart?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.207
We just gonna stay here
and take that hit?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.557
All right, check it, Sonny.
Come on.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.996
Bravo Team will stand by
until further instructed.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.955
Yes, sir.
Roger that.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.826
JASON: Sonny, what the fuck
was that back there?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.437
Why you unloading
on Blackburn like that?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.177
I mean, look, you know,
he's our boy and all,

04:25.221 --> 04:26.831
but he's still
our executive officer.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.616
-You can't do that.
-I know, I'm just getting sick

04:28.659 --> 04:31.575
and tired of this head-shed
horseshit over our Mali op.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.751
Okay, that's top
of the food chain politics

04:33.795 --> 04:35.318
going on right there,
you cannot pin that

04:35.362 --> 04:36.885
on Blackburn or DEVGRU.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.626
All cogs in a corrupt machine.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.323
Whatever they're hiding,
Davis might have dropped,

04:40.367 --> 04:42.238
but I won't, and this ain't
no conspiracy,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.458
Area 51 bullshit, Jas, okay?

04:44.501 --> 04:45.850
Something happened on our op,

04:45.894 --> 04:47.156
and they are trying
to cover it up.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.419
I know, I know.
I know.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.813
I think they're trying
to make me a part of it, too.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.119
What the hell you mean?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.208
I'm up for the Navy Cross
for Mali.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.692
I mean, that run you did saved
all our asses, especially Clay.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
But them giving you that medal
focuses on what you did

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
and not what went wrong.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.698
That's right,
it puts the spotlight on me.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.744
Whatever was rotten, it just
stays in the shadows.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.705
Now, a Navy Cross investigation,

05:14.749 --> 05:17.404
that's gonna span
across your entire career, okay?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.275
They might get wise
to your TBI.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.583
That's not what
I'm worried about.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.019
You know how this works.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.195
Extortion 17,
Roberts Ridge,

05:26.238 --> 05:28.197
all those families trying
to get answers,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.025
and they cannot get the truth.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.158
DoD wants to bury something,
they bury it eight miles deep.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.899
That's why I'm not
gonna stop digging, okay?

05:34.943 --> 05:36.727
And this investigation that
they're gonna do to you,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.381
you don't have shit
to worry about, okay,

05:38.425 --> 05:40.122
'cause the team will have
your back as we always do.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.385
Besides, how many shots
has Bravo 1 taken

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
home and away?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.562
Has one of those shots landed?
No.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.825
I've had plenty of
consequences, Sonny, plenty.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.524
Yeah, look at you now.
You're rolling pretty

05:50.567 --> 05:52.743
with eight and a half
of your nine lives.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.408
SARSFIELD: As galling as we all
find the fact that Tehran

06:05.452 --> 06:08.106
would use a proxy for us
to carry out this attack

06:08.150 --> 06:10.805
on an American vessel,
I'm yet to be presented

06:10.848 --> 06:12.502
with any appropriate response.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.113
RIVAS: Simply no appetite
for open aggression with Iran.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.376
Due respect, Admiral.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.423
We may have a more
specific target.

06:20.467 --> 06:24.601
-More specific?
-Sir, our enemy is one man.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.734
Iranian General
Afshin Rajavi.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.127
Communications with
al-Sham Brigade leadership

06:29.171 --> 06:32.174
show that General Rajavi
was giving them their orders,

06:32.217 --> 06:34.611
supplying weapons,
and personally directed

06:34.655 --> 06:36.308
the attack on the USS Crampton.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.485
General Rajavi is one of
the most highly placed figures

06:38.528 --> 06:39.834
in Tehran.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.226
Why get his hands dirty
with that?

06:41.270 --> 06:43.141
To keep Iran's
plausibly clean, sir,

06:43.185 --> 06:45.883
while he advances their interest
in the region.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.451
Theory is, the use of
Russian missiles in that attack

06:48.495 --> 06:50.366
was an attempt to further pull
our attention

06:50.410 --> 06:52.847
away from the Middle East
toward Moscow.

06:52.890 --> 06:57.068
But that misdirection failed,
drew our SEALs into Syria

06:57.112 --> 07:00.463
and exposed Rajavi as the figure
behind al-Sham Brigade,

07:00.507 --> 07:02.726
a force which has now
been degraded.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.860
-It's a closed loop.
-Except, sir,

07:05.903 --> 07:07.688
the Cramptonattack
was only one salvo

07:07.731 --> 07:09.820
in a campaign
of clandestine operations

07:09.864 --> 07:11.561
Rajavi was waging in the region.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.737
Carried out under his orders
with the full backing

07:13.781 --> 07:16.261
and resources of Iran,
while giving them distance

07:16.305 --> 07:17.915
from the resulting bloodshed.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.657
We'll take a look.
Thank you.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.706
With all due respect, sir,
without action against Rajavi,

07:25.749 --> 07:27.534
we are begging
for another Ukraine,

07:27.577 --> 07:29.318
inviting Iran to launch
an offensive

07:29.361 --> 07:31.494
that will change
the geopolitical landscape

07:31.538 --> 07:32.887
for a generation.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.281
Our chance to stop that is now.
It's him.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.155
We are not venturing
into a sovereign nation

07:40.198 --> 07:41.852
to eliminate a sitting general.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.203
If Rajavi is as hands-on
with these global actions

07:45.247 --> 07:48.642
as it sounds,
he must travel quite a bit.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.471
Stands to reason, sir.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.040
If someone can find
an angle of attack on him

07:56.084 --> 08:00.871
outside Iranian borders without
implicating U.S. forces,

08:00.915 --> 08:03.657
I can see greenlighting
action on him.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.093
Yes, sir.

08:13.797 --> 08:17.322
[door opens and closes]

08:18.498 --> 08:20.891
You rub on that thing enough,
maybe the op genie appears,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.458
grants us some action.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.287
[sighs]

08:25.330 --> 08:27.071
Jas, you know Sonny
getting salty with Command

08:27.115 --> 08:28.943
is not gonna make them
any quicker to task us

08:28.986 --> 08:32.555
-or bring us home.
-I talked to him.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.514
You got his ass screwed back
in the right direction?

08:35.776 --> 08:37.691
I just realized
mine hasn't been.

08:39.388 --> 08:44.915
You know, I've just been looking
over my shoulder so much,

08:44.959 --> 08:50.834
decommissioning, Omar,
medal investigation.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.273
First two storms have passed.
You'll weather the next one.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.319
Right, I'll walk away just fine,

08:57.362 --> 08:59.582
when Clay, Hamal,
and Commander Nouri didn't.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.889
You've taken your share
of damage too, brother.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.587
Right, and I got
to move on every time,

09:04.631 --> 09:07.851
while Clay is just stuck
living in his.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.464
Jas, there's a big difference
between living in your hurt

09:12.508 --> 09:13.988
and living with it.
