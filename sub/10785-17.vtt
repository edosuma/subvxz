Then I have something
to look forward to.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.708
- That's funny.
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.375
Very funny. Have I told

You grow up in a small

No! No, I'm just... I guess I'm
a little intimidated by you.

my ambition for arrogance.

It's just that, you know,
when I first started out
in the business,

15:18.917 --> 15:20.625

toughens the exterior.

When did you start
taking pictures?

20:19.250 --> 20:22.708
For as long as I can remember,
I've always been
fascinated with faces.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.500
And how differently they
appear in certain light.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.708
And I made the discovery
that there are a few faces

20:27.708 --> 20:31.041

different emotions all at once.

in love with him.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.708
He's my best friend.

25:11.708 --> 25:15.500
You. You are some barracuda

25:15.500 --> 25:17.166
who needs someone
to keep her bed warm.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.083
KIM: You don't know
even the first thing about me.

25:19.083 --> 25:22.291
And before you try to
paint me into some role
of the wicked temptress

25:22.291 --> 25:23.959
who's trying to seduce
your non-boyfriend,

25:23.959 --> 25:26.834
at least get your
facts straight.
I told you. I am a virgin.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.375
Oh, please. We Creeksiders
may be provincial

25:29.375 --> 25:31.208
but we are not stupid.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.625
Now, Grams,
it is the nineties,

25:32.625 --> 25:35.500
and women today have
to protect themselves.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.333
You do have contraceptives,
don't you?

25:37.333 --> 25:38.625
That's it. I'm not going.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.458
Oh, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Back here. come on.

25:44.458 --> 25:47.542
I predict that this
will be a magical evening

25:47.542 --> 25:49.583
filled with
old fashioned romance.

25:50.959 --> 25:54.083
And besides, Whit seems
like a really cool guy.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.333
I'm sure he has Trojans
in his wallet.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.083
So, what should I wear?

26:04.083 --> 26:05.834
You can wear
whatever you want.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.333
Just think of this
as an opportunity

26:07.333 --> 26:10.000
for you to try on
a different side of
your personality.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.708
You know,
how would you like
to see yourself?

26:12.708 --> 26:14.875
This one. right here.
this is it.

26:15.667 --> 26:18.667
- I feel like a drag queen.
- No, you look great.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.417
All right, loosen up
there, loosen up.

26:20.417 --> 26:22.166
All right, Joey, give me
a little bit of attitude.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.041
Attitude. Yes, yeah.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.542
Excellent. All right,
you're Madonna
strutting her stuff on stage.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.834
Good. Good.
Keep that up, keep that up.

26:29.834 --> 26:31.208
All right, all right.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.583
Excellent. That's it, Joey.

26:34.583 --> 26:36.083
That's it. That's what
we're talking about.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.083
You're the ghost of Katherine.
You're waiting for Heathcliff

26:38.083 --> 26:39.417
at the end of
Wuthering Heights.

26:39.417 --> 26:43.000
Good one. Thanks.
God, she's amazing.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.083
- So, you two, uh, just friends?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, friends.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.500
- Definitely.
- Good. Excellent, Joey.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.750
Give me one more of those.
Give me one more.

27:16.583 --> 27:17.792
That's it, that's it.

27:18.250 --> 27:21.208
You're fabulous, Joey.
Absolutely fabulous.
I cannot wait to print these up.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.625
Thank you.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.333
You are a born diva.

27:37.500 --> 27:42.667
No. No. No.
Definitely not.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.625
Nope. No.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.166
Dating is just like
riding a bike.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.625
All you have to do
is get back on.

27:52.708 --> 27:54.667
And when he takes
one look at you--

27:54.667 --> 27:55.875
believe me...

27:55.875 --> 27:58.083
He won't want
to do much talking.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.500
You should come
to see me, young man.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.375
Your fortune told
for only $5.00.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.667
I'm just curious...

28:18.667 --> 28:20.750
When somebody comes to you
to have their fortune told,

28:20.750 --> 28:23.125
why can't you just
say something nice,

28:23.125 --> 28:24.000
something reassuring?

28:24.375 --> 28:26.166
Because I guarantee you
that's all they want to hear.

28:26.166 --> 28:28.125
But that would
not be the truth.

28:28.125 --> 28:31.083
If they ask for truth,
then they must hear the answer.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.542
Well, I'm not asking.

28:38.041 --> 28:40.000
I think I tell you anyway.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.208
I see a young man
who wears a mask

28:44.208 --> 28:45.667
that is not his own.

28:46.166 --> 28:49.208
To the world he is
strong and confident.

28:50.041 --> 28:52.708
But beneath the mask
is a little boy

28:52.708 --> 28:56.500
afraid of the world,
afraid of everything.

28:56.500 --> 29:01.291
He knows all he has is
resting on a house of cards.

29:01.291 --> 29:05.917
Even the tiniest gust of wind--
Poof!

29:05.917 --> 29:07.625
Knock it all down.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.458
There's something
I wanted to, um...

29:20.542 --> 29:21.458
Nah.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.959
Nah, just forget it.
It's nothing.

29:25.959 --> 29:27.208
No. what?

29:32.834 --> 29:35.000
There's something
I wanted to, uh...

29:36.041 --> 29:37.000
Yes?

29:38.750 --> 29:42.417
Is your friend Jack
dating anyone?

29:50.083 --> 29:52.000
So, what happened?

29:52.417 --> 29:54.625
Well, he probably would have
thrown me on the ground

29:54.625 --> 29:56.625
and made passionate
love to me if...

29:56.625 --> 29:57.708
If?

29:58.625 --> 29:59.834
He wasn't gay.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.000
What?

30:02.542 --> 30:04.458
He compared me to Madonna
and Marilyn Monroe--

30:04.458 --> 30:06.250
I mean, talk about
your red flags.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.542
What?

30:09.500 --> 30:11.875
He's gay. As in $3 bill.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.166
You're kidding me.

30:14.792 --> 30:16.583
No. Um, and Jack,

30:17.250 --> 30:19.667
you really need
to develop some gaydar.

30:20.875 --> 30:21.875
Oh, yeah.

30:21.875 --> 30:23.166
I hear they're
giving a training course

30:23.166 --> 30:25.083
on that down at
the community center.

30:28.625 --> 30:32.250
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm new at this.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.959
You? What about me?

30:34.959 --> 30:36.625
People look at me
like any minute

30:36.625 --> 30:40.542
I'm about to start tap dancing
to Bette Midler albums.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.375
Well, this should cheer you up.
As it turns out,

30:44.375 --> 30:47.208
a tall, dark stranger's
coming into your life.

30:47.208 --> 30:48.041
What?

30:48.708 --> 30:51.458
He wanted to meet you,
so I told him you'd be
by the fire at 11:00.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.041
You what? Why?

30:53.041 --> 30:55.750
Because he's nice and
smart and attractive.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.208
I mean, what's your problem?
Just go out with him.

30:58.208 --> 31:00.000
You know, just because
there happens to be

31:00.000 --> 31:01.834
a second homosexual
in Capeside,

31:01.834 --> 31:04.750
It doesn't mean that I'm
obligated to go out with him.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.041
So... What did you think?

31:21.291 --> 31:22.583
It's fine.

31:23.583 --> 31:24.583
Fine?

31:26.708 --> 31:28.041
Well, come on, I mean...

31:28.959 --> 31:30.708
Your opinion is
really important to me.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.583
I really want to learn, so...

31:36.041 --> 31:39.583
- You want my honest opinion?
- Yeah. don't hold back.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.375
Are you sure you want the truth?

31:42.208 --> 31:43.166
Yeah.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.542
Ok, then I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it, Dawson.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.375
I think your film is
completely uninspired.

31:49.750 --> 31:53.375
The production value's flat,
your story's non-existent,

31:53.375 --> 31:55.333
even your dialogue
isn't believable.

31:55.333 --> 31:57.500
It needs some work.
I mean, I know that--

31:57.500 --> 31:58.750
It lacks emotion
of any kind

31:58.750 --> 32:00.417
and says nothing
to the audience.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.834
I was thinking if I cut
the B-story line--

32:03.834 --> 32:04.917
It won't help.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.041
It's a preposterous
soap opera

32:07.041 --> 32:09.750
about a bunch of
teenagers who talk too much.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.125
I mean, we've seen it before.

32:11.125 --> 32:14.250
All that self-aware,
self-referential hyperbole

32:14.250 --> 32:16.750
filled with clichés
disguised as send-ups.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.125
It actually borders
on plagiarism.

32:21.959 --> 32:24.000
I mean, this is only
my second film, though.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.417
I'm still learning.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.083
Look, Hollywood's tough.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.917
They don't hand out rejection
with a box of chocolates.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.917
It's real, it's harsh,
and it hurts.

32:37.625 --> 32:40.458
You're sweet, Dawson,
and you're just
the kind of person

32:40.458 --> 32:42.291
that Hollywood eats
for breakfast.

32:42.750 --> 32:46.500
And it would break my heart
to see that happen to you.

32:50.333 --> 32:52.834
Thank you.
I appreciate your honesty.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.917
I'm sorry, Dawson.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.333
Thanks.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.041
I'm sorry, Joey.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.458
I overreacted.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.500
I know that I should be
moving forward

33:29.500 --> 33:32.333
towards this whole new
sexual identity--

33:32.333 --> 33:34.291
The truth is
I'm just not ready.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.500
Not yet.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.667
Yeah. We have a whole lifetime

I'm on the proverbial rebound.

37:10.291 --> 37:12.208

37:18.792 --> 37:21.458
I don't have the relationship

37:23.667 --> 37:28.000
I guess I'm just trying
to fill the void.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.041
Can I ask you something?

37:33.041 --> 37:34.083
Yeah.

Why did the two

I could think of a million
different reasons,

37:42.792 --> 37:48.750
but now I can't think of any.
Does that make any sense?

Oh, well, uh,

38:53.542 --> 38:55.708

- Mmhmm.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.166
Oh. You know, I'm so sorry.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.291
She blew me off.

41:07.291 --> 41:14.250
No. She is here.
She surrounds you.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.250
Then why do I keep
losing her?

41:17.375 --> 41:21.166
That which is lost
can be found again.

41:35.625 --> 41:36.792
Thanks.

43:20.166 --> 43:21.333
Who's there?

43:27.250 --> 43:28.750
Daddy?
