01:18.895 --> 01:20.498
Everyone needs a plan.

01:21.632 --> 01:22.830
That's what my
mom told me as she

01:22.832 --> 01:24.734
was carrying me north
across the border.

01:26.903 --> 01:28.136
Everyone needs a plan.

01:30.641 --> 01:33.475
I'm 22 years old and
still undocumented.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.077
Illegal.

01:35.079 --> 01:37.678
I don't care what
you call it, really.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.682
They're all just other
words for afraid.

01:42.919 --> 01:44.819
I grew up knowing
that any one of us,

01:44.821 --> 01:47.455
my mom, my dad, my sisters,

01:47.457 --> 01:50.191
could be basically
kidnapped by the government.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.628
My mother and my brother
were just taken by immigration.

01:52.630 --> 01:56.999
My dad was detained in front
of me on my way to school.

02:02.939 --> 02:04.405
Most
immigrants pass through

02:04.407 --> 02:06.407
a kind of purgatory on their
way out of the country.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.210
A detention center.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.945
Inside, there's
been cases of abuse

02:10.947 --> 02:12.950
and even mysterious death.

02:15.119 --> 02:17.421
Well, tonight, I
have one question.

02:19.155 --> 02:20.355
How can I get in?

02:41.044 --> 02:43.214
Our inside man
was Claudio Rojas.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.882
He just didn't know it yet.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.134
Yeah?

03:05.136 --> 03:06.237
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:52.448 --> 03:53.714
Claudio Rojas!

03:54.552 --> 03:56.017
Papa?

03:56.019 --> 03:56.487
We have an
order for your deportation.

04:09.365 --> 04:11.266
19108.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.167
1950YN.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.224
In cases
like your father's

04:36.226 --> 04:38.460
there's really nothing
that can be done.

04:38.462 --> 04:40.831
We can help speed
up his deportation.

04:41.899 --> 04:43.000
Okay, thanks.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.832
My name is Marco Saavedra.

05:16.834 --> 05:19.000
I am undocumented and unafraid.

05:19.002 --> 05:21.335
I am originally
from Oaxaca, Mexico.

05:21.337 --> 05:22.770
I crossed the border
at the age of three

05:22.772 --> 05:25.207
through the Sonoran Desert.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.241
Went to school in Massachusetts.

05:27.243 --> 05:31.012
I believe that none of us are
free as long as one family

05:31.014 --> 05:34.015
is suffering deportation
or separation.

05:49.466 --> 05:50.965
Everyone needs a plan.

06:04.514 --> 06:06.750
For two years I've been
working with a group.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.118
We're all young illegals.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.286
Our mission?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.923
Stop the deportations.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.060
It was self defense.

06:17.361 --> 06:18.228
Our strategy?

06:19.430 --> 06:23.733
Organize, escalate,
shut something down.

06:25.902 --> 06:29.238
We came outta the shadows and
stopped a few deportations.

06:31.175 --> 06:32.009
Our own.

06:35.045 --> 06:36.510
The new plan?

06:36.512 --> 06:39.816
Get into the Broward Detention
Center and get people out.

06:44.954 --> 06:46.421
What was the number again?

06:46.423 --> 06:48.823
Come on Marco, 207.

06:57.134 --> 06:58.200
All right.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.570
See you guys soon, I hope.

07:11.014 --> 07:11.947
Good luck.

07:22.392 --> 07:23.993
The Border Patrol.

07:25.596 --> 07:26.928
My own personal Death Star.

07:29.466 --> 07:30.965
Customs and Border Protection

07:30.967 --> 07:33.169
is twice the size of the FBI.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.275
The largest law enforcement
agency the world has ever known.

07:51.154 --> 07:53.320
What can I do for ya?

07:53.322 --> 07:54.157
Hi.

07:56.159 --> 07:59.029
I'm looking for my cousin.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.796
Your cousin, why?

08:01.798 --> 08:05.935
We may think he, he's
detained by the Border Patrol.

08:07.036 --> 08:09.503
Is he an illegal alien?

08:09.505 --> 08:10.738
Does he have papers to be here?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.010
No, he
don't have papers.

08:14.411 --> 08:18.115
Did he come
here, to America illegally?

08:19.015 --> 08:20.714
We all came together.

08:20.716 --> 08:25.253
Do you have
papers to be here legally?

08:25.255 --> 08:26.322
No.

08:27.558 --> 08:29.425
You know
I have to arrest you.

08:32.128 --> 08:33.229
Oh.

08:34.698 --> 08:38.600
Keep your
hands behind your back.

08:38.602 --> 08:39.534
Come on, turn around, now.

08:39.535 --> 08:41.436
Put your hands behind your back.

08:57.220 --> 08:58.687
I've determined you're in
this country illegally.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.154
You're gonna be transported
to a detention facility

09:00.156 --> 09:02.459
and most likely deported
given your previous arrest.

09:03.993 --> 09:04.894
Any questions?

09:09.099 --> 09:09.932
No.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.616
They called Broward a
model detention center.

09:32.222 --> 09:34.324
Detainees with no
criminal record,

09:35.526 --> 09:38.360
minimum security,
TVs in every room.

09:44.434 --> 09:46.770
I kept telling myself
it was a Florida motel

09:47.671 --> 09:49.571
where I couldn't check out.

10:08.992 --> 10:11.060
A year ago I was reading Kafka.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.563
Now I was living it.

10:15.932 --> 10:18.933
Because none of the men
in here committed crimes,

10:18.935 --> 10:20.737
they weren't being
legally punished.

10:21.604 --> 10:23.203
And so they don't get a right

10:23.205 --> 10:25.740
to a trial before
getting locked up.

10:25.742 --> 10:28.108
They don't get a court
appointed lawyer.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.178
They don't even get a sentence.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.880
They just get warehoused.

10:57.174 --> 10:59.476
I'm with the National
Immigrant Youth Alliance.

11:08.584 --> 11:13.022
Now who's on
the mess hall for turn over?

14:41.797 --> 14:42.631
Rojas.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.101
Call from

15:21.103 --> 15:24.371
an inmate at Broward
Transitional Center.

15:24.373 --> 15:27.608
This call is subject to
recording and monitoring.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.345
Mohammad, did you know
they have solitary in here?

15:30.347 --> 15:31.178
Sure.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.112
You did?

15:32.114 --> 15:33.347
And you didn't tell me this?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.848
Why,
are you scared?

15:34.850 --> 15:36.116
No, I'm not scared.

15:36.118 --> 15:37.552
Of course not.

15:37.554 --> 15:38.752
I just didn't know.

15:38.754 --> 15:40.154
Just
don't get sent there.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.923
And also, we have
somebody comin' by later,

15:41.925 --> 15:43.290
they're gonna bring
you some paperwork.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.793
Gotta go my love, Maria.

15:45.795 --> 15:47.097
Okay, okay, bye.

15:50.132 --> 15:52.266
Okay, it's going.

15:52.268 --> 15:53.367
Should I speak up
louder or is that fine?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.534
- Just so I know I'm not...
- That's good.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.602
Okay.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.505
I hate videos.

15:57.507 --> 15:58.906
Let's go.

15:58.908 --> 16:00.308
Hi everybody, my
name's Mohammad.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.043
I am undocumented.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.778
My parents immigrated
here from Iran

16:03.780 --> 16:05.212
when I was just three years old.

16:15.325 --> 16:17.625
If you were deported where
would you be deported to?

16:17.627 --> 16:19.394
If I was deported I
would be deported to Iran,

16:19.396 --> 16:20.962
and because I'm
gay that's probably

16:20.964 --> 16:22.829
not the best place to go.

16:22.831 --> 16:24.966
Please support the
youth, support education,

16:24.968 --> 16:25.799
pass the DREAM Act.

16:27.436 --> 16:28.468
The federal bill

16:28.470 --> 16:30.471
would give
undocumented immigrants

16:30.473 --> 16:31.872
brought to the U.S. as children

16:31.874 --> 16:34.842
a pathway to
permanent citizenship.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.877
One day my mom just
learned about the DREAM Act

16:36.879 --> 16:38.913
and what she told me was,
"Don't ever search for it

16:38.915 --> 16:41.949
"'cause the government
will find us somehow."

16:41.951 --> 16:44.385
And so the first thing I did
is I Googled the DREAM Act.

16:44.387 --> 16:46.087
From there I sorta got connected

16:46.089 --> 16:47.587
with other undocumented youth.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.090
Essentially what we're
gonna do from now

16:49.092 --> 16:51.024
is the training is
still gonna happen.

16:51.026 --> 16:53.593
It's gonna start as soon as
we kick everybody else out.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.295
We're just gonna
do the legal part

16:55.297 --> 16:56.597
for the folks that
are doing the action,

16:56.599 --> 16:58.098
so we'll talk about that.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.334
We're here ask Senator McCain
to cosponsor the DREAM Act.

17:00.336 --> 17:02.537
So we're here to ask him to
cosponsor the bill right now.

17:02.539 --> 17:04.071
Five protestors,

17:04.074 --> 17:06.773
reportedly all illegal
immigrants are refusing to leave.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.008
Marking one

17:08.010 --> 17:10.210
of the first known
instances activists

17:10.212 --> 17:11.512
have risked deportation.

17:11.513 --> 17:12.380
DREAM Act now!

17:12.382 --> 17:13.714
DREAM Act now!

17:13.717 --> 17:15.415
DREAM Act now!

17:15.417 --> 17:17.119
DREAM Act now!

17:19.555 --> 17:21.523
How do you wish to plead, Sir?

17:22.459 --> 17:23.724
Not guilty.

17:23.727 --> 17:25.392
The one thing that every
undocumented kid is told

17:25.394 --> 17:28.262
is if you see a police
officer run and hide

17:28.263 --> 17:30.264
because you could get
turned over to immigration.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.601
What we learned is
that to actually

17:34.603 --> 17:35.969
have power as an immigrant,

17:35.971 --> 17:38.074
you have to do the
exact opposite.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.342
Whenever we got
arrested publicly,

17:42.344 --> 17:44.144
ICE was nowhere to be found.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.912
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go, turn around.

17:45.914 --> 17:46.747
Let's go.

17:50.519 --> 17:51.718
So once we
sort of had the safety

17:51.720 --> 17:54.322
of knowing we could
not be deported,

17:54.324 --> 17:56.157
we sort of had
infinite possibilities.

18:12.542 --> 18:13.807
Okay.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.547
Hey, I'm working with a group

18:20.549 --> 18:22.550
and we're tryin' to
get people outta here.

18:22.552 --> 18:25.352
I was wondering if I could
give you their number?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.056
Wait, get people out?

18:28.158 --> 18:28.992
How?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.892
Well, how'd you
end up in here?

18:31.894 --> 18:32.959
So stupid, man.

18:32.961 --> 18:34.328
I don't have a driver's license,

18:34.330 --> 18:35.696
so I was riding my
bike on the sidewalk

18:35.698 --> 18:37.467
and I get stopped by the cops.

18:40.937 --> 18:42.439
They hand me over to ICE.

18:44.239 --> 18:45.739
But the flip side is this.

18:45.741 --> 18:47.842
As quick as they sweep you
up they can release you.

18:47.844 --> 18:49.377
All it takes is
someone from ICE,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.446
from the President on
down to make that call.

18:51.448 --> 18:52.746
That's what our group does.

18:52.748 --> 18:54.916
We put pressure on those people.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.284
Let me see your book.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.457
Call this number.

19:03.459 --> 19:05.059
Tell 'em Marco told you to call.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.203
Copy that, comin' now.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.840
I want that cleaned up by lunch.

19:18.307 --> 19:19.241
Sure thing, boss.

19:21.344 --> 19:22.277
You got a minute?

19:24.581 --> 19:26.147
Sure.

19:26.149 --> 19:27.183
From India?

19:28.517 --> 19:29.352
Sri Lanka.

19:32.889 --> 19:35.225
How long you been in here?

19:37.326 --> 19:38.127
Two years.

19:39.161 --> 19:41.094
Hey, my friend, my friend.

19:41.096 --> 19:45.535
Oh.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.134
He's resisting.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.236
Hey, do not resist.

20:23.238 --> 20:25.105
Up against the wall.

20:25.107 --> 20:26.873
Grab the ankles, damn it.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.517
Do not resist!

21:01.143 --> 21:02.109
Hi.

21:02.111 --> 21:03.680
Do you know a guy named Marco?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.981
He said I should call you,

21:07.417 --> 21:09.485
and to tell you I'm
a DREAMER at Broward.

21:11.621 --> 21:14.889
We basically did this whole
intake when people called us.

21:14.891 --> 21:16.756
We got their name,
their alien number,

21:16.758 --> 21:19.526
how they got detained,
their history.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.762
Ismael, what's
his story, Viri?

21:21.764 --> 21:24.765
Ismael came by
himself to the U.S.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.168
at the age of 12 and
he's from Guatemala

21:27.170 --> 21:30.905
and he has been here since
and he's 18 years old now.

21:30.907 --> 21:32.974
Every deportation
can be stopped.

21:32.976 --> 21:34.708
The government has the power

21:34.710 --> 21:37.544
to grant discretion for
anybody not to be deported.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.380
Yeah, so it's the National ICE

21:39.382 --> 21:41.515
in D.C. that can do something.

21:41.517 --> 21:44.819
The perfect example is Obama's
uncle who's undocumented.

21:44.821 --> 21:45.785
He had a DUI.

21:45.787 --> 21:47.522
His deportation was stopped.

21:50.093 --> 21:52.226
Once it was like
okay, this case is solid,

21:52.228 --> 21:54.564
we started an online petition.

21:56.431 --> 21:58.232
Every time somebody
would sign the petition,

21:58.234 --> 21:59.367
there was an automatic email

21:59.369 --> 22:00.834
that was generated that was sent

22:00.836 --> 22:04.537
to the personal email of someone
that worked at Immigration.

22:04.539 --> 22:07.140
We had probably 4,000
signatures in just

22:07.142 --> 22:09.043
the period of like, 12 hours.

22:09.045 --> 22:10.647
His name is Ismael.

22:14.784 --> 22:16.953
5360, 5360.

23:32.694 --> 23:34.527
Ismael, I got a
question for you, man.

23:34.529 --> 23:36.132
What's your room number inside?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.636
264?

23:42.638 --> 23:45.238
Obama was saying, "We're
not jailing people

23:45.240 --> 23:46.607
"unless they are criminals."

23:46.609 --> 23:47.874
Hey, question for you.

23:47.876 --> 23:49.778
Do you have a GED or
high school diploma?

23:52.582 --> 23:53.848
At this point
there was already

23:53.850 --> 23:56.249
the online petition
calling for his release,

23:56.251 --> 23:57.918
but we needed more.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.719
We reached out
to Senator Nelson

23:59.721 --> 24:02.188
and Ted Deutch who's
a representative

24:02.190 --> 24:05.426
because his district is the
Broward Detention Center.

24:05.428 --> 24:07.128
The purpose of
petitions was really

24:07.130 --> 24:10.130
to annoy the hell
out of the offices.

24:10.132 --> 24:12.733
Some offices clearly
were overwhelmed

24:12.735 --> 24:15.036
by the calls that came in.

24:16.639 --> 24:20.174
It's because of the National
Immigrant Youth Alliance

24:20.176 --> 24:22.243
that we were first made aware

24:22.245 --> 24:24.311
of what was happening
at this facility.

24:24.313 --> 24:25.680
That's why we got involved.

24:27.417 --> 24:29.082
Okay, I'm gonna
hand you back to Bryan

24:29.084 --> 24:30.452
but I'm all good at my end.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.399
Ismael Garcia?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.638
Ismael Garcia?

24:54.376 --> 24:55.775
Are you Ismael?

24:55.777 --> 24:57.277
Come with me to
processing, let's go.

24:57.279 --> 24:58.280
I ain't got all day.

25:01.049 --> 25:02.283
Yes, hi.

25:02.285 --> 25:06.019
I'm calling to find out
the status of a case.

25:06.021 --> 25:06.853
Okay.

25:06.855 --> 25:07.688
What is his name?

25:07.690 --> 25:08.522
Ismael.

25:08.524 --> 25:10.824
I-S-M-A-E-L.

25:10.826 --> 25:12.759
Okay, he has been released?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.593
Yes.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.527
Okay, okay.

25:14.529 --> 25:15.329
That's what I wanted to know.

25:15.331 --> 25:16.563
Thank you.

25:16.565 --> 25:17.665
- You're welcome.
- Okay, buh bye.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.168
Buh bye.

25:20.569 --> 25:21.901
Ismael got released.

25:21.903 --> 25:24.071
DREAMER released,
DREAMER released,

25:24.073 --> 25:27.874
- DREAMER released!
- Ismael got released.

26:27.702 --> 26:28.936
Here you go.

26:41.284 --> 26:46.289
Okay.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.756
So I call my dad
and my dad comes in,

27:23.758 --> 27:27.727
and as soon as he came in,
like Border Patrol showed up.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.298
So, they were like, "Okay,
we have to take you in."

27:41.043 --> 27:43.379
I was there for three
months with my dad.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.291
But my dad came out
with a different deal.

27:57.293 --> 27:58.825
He came out with the condition

27:58.827 --> 28:02.430
of leaving the country
after three months.

28:17.646 --> 28:18.647
Oh, Marco.

28:27.957 --> 28:28.991
Thank
you.

28:46.275 --> 28:50.476
Call the
group that freed Ismael.

28:50.478 --> 28:51.644
Call this number
with your case,

28:51.646 --> 28:54.149
they're waiting for your call.

29:47.902 --> 29:49.035
Hey, this message

29:49.037 --> 29:50.236
- is for Viridiana...
- Hold on.

29:50.238 --> 29:51.772
- Hello, hello?
- Hi, I'm calling

29:51.774 --> 29:55.007
on behalf of my husband who
is at BTC Detention Center.

29:55.009 --> 29:56.342
Calls were coming in

29:56.344 --> 29:59.114
from sunrise to
sundown everyday.

30:07.823 --> 30:10.623
- My brother is in ICE.
- My husband.

30:10.625 --> 30:11.891
- My cousin.
- He's in

30:11.893 --> 30:13.895
the Broward County
Detention Center.

30:14.796 --> 30:17.298
And I was wanting to see...

30:19.101 --> 30:20.967
The 600 man
warehoused in here

30:20.969 --> 30:22.870
all had different cases.

30:22.872 --> 30:24.105
Ismael was easy.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.407
Claudio will be hard.

30:27.977 --> 30:30.246
To get him out was gonna
take a big campaign.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.781
Time, people, planning.

30:33.783 --> 30:35.248
Whether or not he got to stay

30:35.250 --> 30:38.017
in the country was a question
of who will move faster?

30:38.019 --> 30:39.988
Us or them?

30:44.459 --> 30:46.092
The GEO Group has
a contract to run

30:46.094 --> 30:48.296
this facility on behalf
of Homeland Security.

30:49.565 --> 30:51.297
The job program allows detainees

30:51.299 --> 30:52.967
to get involved
and be productive.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.873
Look at your credentials.

30:59.708 --> 31:02.342
Speak English, Spanish.

31:02.344 --> 31:04.345
Got some computer skills.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.584
With that you're lookin' at
library and or nurse station.

31:10.018 --> 31:12.353
That was my first
legitimate job interview,

31:13.521 --> 31:15.223
and my first legal
job in this country.

31:17.692 --> 31:22.096
Working for the GEO Group
earning a dollar a day.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.765
Take the aspirin.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.501
It should help
control the swelling.

31:27.503 --> 31:30.003
Come on, please.

31:30.005 --> 31:30.938
What do you want?

31:30.940 --> 31:32.939
Oh, the Job Office sent me.

31:32.941 --> 31:34.309
Oh, yeah.

31:42.218 --> 31:46.486
First mission, run this to
the station on the east wing.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.321
Thank you.

31:51.927 --> 31:54.163
Nurse told me to take
these to the east wing.

31:58.933 --> 32:01.534
Since the company only
paid a dollar a day,

32:01.536 --> 32:03.972
they had to offer something
else as compensation.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.007
Visitors.

32:07.242 --> 32:09.744
If you agreed to work,
you get more visitors.

32:11.212 --> 32:12.981
That's why most
men worked in here.

32:14.415 --> 32:15.917
That's why I took a job, too.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.530
- Get through, come back.
- Yeah.

32:30.164 --> 32:31.364
I didn't even know there was

32:31.366 --> 32:32.966
a woman side to the
detention center

32:32.968 --> 32:34.834
until Marco turns himself in

32:34.836 --> 32:37.236
and he gets in and he's like,

32:37.238 --> 32:39.305
"Yeah, there's a woman's side."

32:39.307 --> 32:42.008
And then Mo is like, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

32:42.010 --> 32:45.512
This little light bulb went
on and he's like, "Hey Viri."

32:45.514 --> 32:47.581
And I'm like, "Yeah,
I know.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.315
"I know what you're gonna say."

32:49.317 --> 32:50.816
But like Ricardo could

32:50.818 --> 32:53.486
- be here and Ricardo the east.
- Okay, guys let's go eat.

32:53.488 --> 32:55.155
Viri, are you ready
to get detained?

32:57.125 --> 32:58.391
So how did you meet each other

32:58.393 --> 33:01.394
'cause you all come
from different state?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.530
We all did organizing
around legislation,

33:03.532 --> 33:04.765
and so we all kind of talked

33:04.767 --> 33:05.932
to each other on the
phone for awhile,

33:05.934 --> 33:07.167
- those sorts
- Oh, wow.

33:07.169 --> 33:08.034
- of things and then...
- Have you heard of it?

33:08.036 --> 33:08.567
- The DREAM Act?
- No.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.503
Oh.

33:09.505 --> 33:10.670
Do you know there's

33:10.672 --> 33:12.639
an immigration detention
center in Broward?

33:12.641 --> 33:14.373
So they have 600
men and 100 women

33:14.375 --> 33:16.642
and they're in there
for like eight months.

33:16.644 --> 33:17.546
Six, seven months.

33:18.780 --> 33:19.979
So she's gonna go there to find

33:19.981 --> 33:22.549
a story so that we
can work on the cases.

33:22.551 --> 33:23.950
She's the bait.

33:23.952 --> 33:24.918
She's our bait, yeah.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.321
There you go.

33:27.323 --> 33:29.624
I think that's the best analysis
of what's going on here.

33:30.793 --> 33:32.594
I'm gonna have my
birthday in detention.

33:33.996 --> 33:38.200
I mean, I had a dress on and
like, makeup, my hair was done.

33:42.638 --> 33:45.671
I called my mom and
my dad and I said,

33:45.673 --> 33:47.575
"This is what I'm about to do."

33:49.010 --> 33:51.378
They were scared
for their daughter.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.280
I remember me telling them,

33:53.282 --> 33:56.719
"Well, the reality is that
these people could be you."

33:58.921 --> 34:00.187
She's gonna walk
to the Border Patrol.

34:00.189 --> 34:01.822
You remember the Border
Patrol building, right?

34:01.824 --> 34:03.023
- Yeah.
- The one on the left.

34:03.025 --> 34:04.024
- Yeah.
- The parking lot was empty.

34:04.026 --> 34:04.824
Yeah.

34:04.826 --> 34:06.059
Go in.

34:06.061 --> 34:06.726
I'm looking for
my friend, Marco.

34:06.728 --> 34:07.694
Left here.

34:11.632 --> 34:16.002
The idea for Viridiana to
infiltrate was to escalate.

34:35.956 --> 34:37.958
Are you like, lost?

34:41.763 --> 34:43.831
Me no papers.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.335
Okay, how did you get here?

34:49.337 --> 34:50.870
Who dropped you off?

34:53.442 --> 34:55.077
Can one of you
guys get out here?

34:56.779 --> 34:58.344
Wrong place.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.612
Sorry.

35:02.417 --> 35:05.019
Damn it, why did
she dress so fancy?

35:14.228 --> 35:15.362
They saw the Mustang?

35:15.364 --> 35:16.862
They asked if
someone dropped her off

35:16.864 --> 35:19.966
and that he wanted to know
the truth, what's going on.

35:19.968 --> 35:20.900
Okay, tell
her not to walk here.

35:20.902 --> 35:21.870
Tell her to keep walking.

35:24.239 --> 35:26.175
Just keep
walking, tell her...

35:27.442 --> 35:29.076
Just keep walking.

35:29.078 --> 35:30.944
She came in the car,
slammed the door.

35:30.946 --> 35:33.449
Her face was red,
just really upset.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.919
He's an asshole.

35:38.853 --> 35:43.623
It wasn't just enough
to go turn myself in.

35:43.625 --> 35:48.060
I needed to prepare to
actually play this role.

35:54.169 --> 35:55.701
All
visitors be advised,

35:55.703 --> 35:59.272
all bags and large personal
belongings will be searched.

36:06.814 --> 36:08.850
Berlinger
here to see Saavedra.

36:12.453 --> 36:15.723
Radam, short
for Radical Adam.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.560
He was a U.S. citizen,
the only one in our group.

36:21.330 --> 36:22.728
- ID.
- Since most of the guys

36:22.730 --> 36:24.730
in here have
undocumented families,

36:24.732 --> 36:26.966
those families can't come visit.

36:26.968 --> 36:28.667
My parents couldn't visit me.

36:28.669 --> 36:29.870
Go in.

36:29.872 --> 36:30.873
Mo and Viri
couldn't visit me.

36:32.841 --> 36:34.473
But Radical Adam could.

36:41.250 --> 36:42.082
Hi.

36:42.084 --> 36:43.150
Hey.

36:43.152 --> 36:44.951
- I'm Radam.
- Yeah, I know.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.353
Mo told me.

36:46.355 --> 36:47.222
You doin' okay?

36:49.056 --> 36:51.958
A lot better than most
of these guys in here.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.726
I miss my mom's cooking.

36:53.728 --> 36:54.960
She has a restaurant, right?

36:54.962 --> 36:56.897
Yeah, Mexican
food in New York.

36:56.899 --> 36:57.897
I keep tellin' her to call

36:57.899 --> 37:02.002
it The Five Burros but...

37:02.004 --> 37:03.538
Okay, well let's do this.

37:10.111 --> 37:11.277
There's a senator
who's interested

37:11.279 --> 37:13.679
in learning more
about Claudio's case.

37:13.681 --> 37:14.948
There's not much time.

37:14.950 --> 37:16.716
I'll come back in an
hour to pick his up.

37:16.718 --> 37:17.917
- Okay.
- Now there are waivers

37:17.919 --> 37:19.219
in there for the other
urgent cases, too.

37:19.221 --> 37:21.855
Raoul Contralis, Gustafo
Galindo, Pablo Oriano.

37:21.857 --> 37:23.692
Okay, I'll try to
get 'em all done.

37:25.627 --> 37:26.460
Thanks.

37:31.098 --> 37:32.866
Okay, these are basically
permission slips

37:32.868 --> 37:34.570
to waive your right to privacy.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.217
Spread 'em.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.225
Dispatch.

38:46.375 --> 38:47.540
Everything's in there.

38:47.542 --> 38:48.944
Beni didn't sign.

38:50.344 --> 38:51.944
I'm working on getting you
some money for your commissary,

38:51.946 --> 38:53.414
you can buy some better food.

38:59.821 --> 39:01.487
With the
privacy waivers out,

39:01.489 --> 39:03.690
the team on the outside could
build powerful campaigns

39:03.692 --> 39:06.625
to press for the
detainees to be freed.

39:15.002 --> 39:16.169
Oh, fuck this shit.

39:16.171 --> 39:17.603
Don't tell me the call dropped.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.705
My
call dropped, too.

39:18.707 --> 39:20.607
- Were you the same?
- Yeah.

39:24.245 --> 39:25.511
Beni had been in the U.S.

39:25.513 --> 39:28.315
for 10 years trying
to get asylum.

39:28.317 --> 39:31.083
He had been tortured
back in his home country.

39:31.085 --> 39:33.819
I understand why he didn't
wanna sign the waiver.

39:33.821 --> 39:36.188
He didn't like
government documents.

39:36.190 --> 39:38.391
But his asylum
request was denied,

39:38.393 --> 39:39.893
and now he was in limbo.

40:13.594 --> 40:14.426
Beni?

40:25.774 --> 40:29.942
Call from an inmate at
Broward Transitional Center.

40:29.944 --> 40:31.377
Mohammad, they're
deporting Beni.

40:31.379 --> 40:32.679
His flight leaves tonight.

40:32.681 --> 40:33.513
Yeah, yeah, I know.

40:33.515 --> 40:34.848
He just called his wife.

40:34.850 --> 40:36.482
Hey, can you please,
please, please try

40:36.484 --> 40:38.317
and find out what
time his flight is?

40:38.319 --> 40:39.086
Hey Claudio?

40:42.757 --> 40:44.022
Okay, but what do I tell him?

40:44.024 --> 40:45.891
So, tell him to try
and refuse to board.

40:45.893 --> 40:47.761
Like, do the same strategy
as Andy that he did,

40:47.763 --> 40:49.929
which was he told
the pilot that he

40:49.931 --> 40:51.765
was afraid his
life was in danger.

40:51.767 --> 40:53.132
He refused to board.

40:53.134 --> 40:54.667
Tell him to refuse to
put on his seatbelt

40:54.669 --> 40:56.368
and those sorts of things.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.004
I mean, ICE can't
drug him right there

40:58.006 --> 40:59.272
on the spot if they want to,

40:59.274 --> 41:00.940
but can you please,
please, please try

41:00.942 --> 41:02.341
and find out what
time his flight is?

41:02.343 --> 41:03.810
Okay, okay, I'll try.

41:03.812 --> 41:05.210
And call me back right away.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.145
I'll do it.

41:06.147 --> 41:07.379
'Cause what he told his wife

41:07.381 --> 41:08.783
is that he's gonna
get moved at 11.

42:40.875 --> 42:41.774
What are
you lookin' at, man?

42:41.776 --> 42:42.611
Let's go.

42:50.618 --> 42:52.252
- Hey, Anita?
- Hey, Mo?

42:52.254 --> 42:53.786
Yes.

42:53.788 --> 42:56.522
Hey, so we had somebody just
call the deportation officer.

42:56.524 --> 42:57.824
Uh huh.

42:57.826 --> 42:59.491
And they said that
he refused to board

42:59.493 --> 43:01.928
so they're bringing
him back to Broward.

43:05.700 --> 43:08.033
Oh my God!

43:08.035 --> 43:09.537
And he's for sure?

43:11.138 --> 43:13.605
Yeah, so that's what the
deportation officer said

43:13.607 --> 43:15.475
that he's on his
way back to Broward

43:15.477 --> 43:16.708
because he refused to board.

43:16.710 --> 43:18.877
Oh my God.

43:18.879 --> 43:20.913
Let's see if we can
use the urgency right now

43:20.915 --> 43:23.384
and get them to release him.

43:24.486 --> 43:25.585
Okay, perfect, Mo.

43:25.587 --> 43:26.419
Thank you very much.

43:26.421 --> 43:27.353
No problem.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.054
I'll talk to you soon, buh bye.

43:29.056 --> 43:29.888
Bye.

43:29.890 --> 43:32.424
Aw, she's so happy.

43:32.426 --> 43:33.428
Aw.

43:34.428 --> 43:36.295
She's so happy.

43:36.297 --> 43:37.230
That's too much.

43:37.232 --> 43:38.330
I can't handle it.

43:38.332 --> 43:39.565
She's so happy.

43:39.567 --> 43:40.766
I can't handle it
hearing somebody cry.

43:40.768 --> 43:41.701
And
that's just because

43:41.703 --> 43:42.734
he's coming back to Broward.

43:42.736 --> 43:43.670
- I know.
- We need to get him out

43:43.672 --> 43:44.937
- I know.
- right away.

43:59.087 --> 44:01.386
There was a man that
reached out to us.

44:01.388 --> 44:04.924
His wife was detained, Maria.

44:04.926 --> 44:07.859
We said to him there's
a girl from our team

44:07.861 --> 44:10.562
who's gonna turn herself in.

44:10.564 --> 44:12.265
Oh, this is perfect.

44:12.267 --> 44:13.799
It's a
complete different look.

44:13.801 --> 44:16.234
This is how
you get detained.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.971
In order to get
Viridiana inside

44:17.973 --> 44:20.005
we had to sort of
become the stereotypes

44:20.007 --> 44:22.708
that we advocated against.

44:22.710 --> 44:23.645
Really?

44:24.546 --> 44:26.147
This is not believable.

44:31.152 --> 44:34.020
Mister, I'm here
to turn myself in.

44:34.022 --> 44:34.953
- No, too modest.
- Too formal.

44:34.955 --> 44:36.388
Too DREAMER.

44:36.390 --> 44:37.757
Too DREAMER.

44:37.759 --> 44:39.292
- I'm here to...
- It's gotta be Spanish.

44:39.294 --> 44:42.194
I here turn self in.

44:44.498 --> 44:46.031
You've been taking
too many calls.

44:46.033 --> 44:50.069
I can almost
compare it to a theater play.

44:50.071 --> 44:53.975
Mo being the director and
Marco and I being actors.

45:04.285 --> 45:05.217
- All right.
- You're very good

45:05.219 --> 45:06.486
when you're whining as well.

45:06.488 --> 45:08.154
Like, when you made
it sound very whiny.

45:08.156 --> 45:09.422
No, no, like very whiny

45:09.424 --> 45:10.790
- in terms of like...
- No, I know.

45:10.792 --> 45:11.723
- That's what I'm tryin' to...
- 'Cause then more

45:11.725 --> 45:13.192
of your sadness came out in it,

45:13.194 --> 45:16.295
and that's really good 'cause
it's natural desperation.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.830
So make it sound desperate.

45:24.239 --> 45:26.839
I'm going up there to
see if they'll let me in.

45:26.841 --> 45:28.274
Yeah and when you go up there,

45:28.276 --> 45:30.643
be like I wanna go
to Border Patrol,

45:30.645 --> 45:31.911
I wanna go to Border Patrol.

45:31.913 --> 45:34.815
And he's like, wait,
why are you coming?

45:35.817 --> 45:38.183
You wanna smoke before you go?

45:38.185 --> 45:40.353
No, I don't wanna
smoke before I go.

45:40.355 --> 45:41.620
Do you
want a shot of Patron?

45:41.622 --> 45:43.790
No, I don't want
a shot of Patron.

45:43.792 --> 45:44.623
- You good?
- Good luck, Viri.

45:44.625 --> 45:45.824
Yeah, I'm gonna cry

45:45.826 --> 45:47.159
- so that I do it
- Perfect, perfect.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.594
- because if not I'm gonna...
- Be emotional.

46:36.544 --> 46:37.476
- Damn it.
- Did you hang up?

46:37.478 --> 46:38.310
She hung up.

46:38.312 --> 46:39.411
Should I call her again?

46:39.413 --> 46:40.247
No.

46:58.700 --> 46:59.498
Hello?

46:59.500 --> 47:00.299
- Hello?
- Hi.

47:00.301 --> 47:01.134
Oh hi.

47:01.136 --> 47:01.967
Hi, how are you?

47:01.969 --> 47:03.268
Who am I speaking with?

47:03.270 --> 47:04.670
Santiago.

47:04.672 --> 47:06.605
- Don't say a last name.
- I'm sorry?

47:06.607 --> 47:07.839
Santiago.

47:07.841 --> 47:08.775
Don't
say a last name.

47:08.777 --> 47:09.775
Okay, hi Santiago.

47:09.777 --> 47:11.176
My name is Santiago, too.

47:11.178 --> 47:12.411
Oh.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.246
So
I like that name.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.080
Okay.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.015
Check this out.

47:16.017 --> 47:17.449
Okay.

47:17.451 --> 47:18.250
Do you
speak Spanish or English?

47:18.252 --> 47:19.384
Which one's better

47:19.386 --> 47:20.051
- for you 'cause I...
- English.

47:20.053 --> 47:20.853
English.

47:20.855 --> 47:22.020
I prefer English.

47:22.022 --> 47:22.855
Okay.

47:22.857 --> 47:23.790
All right.

47:23.792 --> 47:25.792
Hey, is your mother there?

47:25.794 --> 47:26.625
My mother?

47:26.627 --> 47:27.893
Yes.

47:27.895 --> 47:30.862
Yeah, can
I talk to your mother?

47:30.864 --> 47:32.565
It makes it easier for me.

47:32.567 --> 47:35.835
She doesn't speak English.

47:35.837 --> 47:38.706
Yeah, no, I'll
speak Spanish to your mother.

47:39.573 --> 47:40.739
She says that she doesn't

47:40.741 --> 47:43.975
feel comfortable
speakin' on the phone.

47:43.977 --> 47:45.479
Okay.

47:47.614 --> 47:48.716
He bought it.

48:22.417 --> 48:23.716
Line it up!

48:27.689 --> 48:29.589
Let's go!

48:29.591 --> 48:31.857
Line it up!

48:31.859 --> 48:36.864
Let's go.

49:04.591 --> 49:07.326
Viri, I
have a question for you.

49:07.328 --> 49:08.794
Yeah?

49:08.796 --> 49:10.297
At what point did you stop
talking in only Spanish?

49:12.667 --> 49:15.301
When I
finally made it to BTC.

49:15.303 --> 49:16.368
Okay, okay.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.402
Cool.

49:17.404 --> 49:18.573
Hey, and you saw Marco?

49:20.274 --> 49:22.174
I saw him, yeah.

49:22.176 --> 49:23.609
Aw, cute.

49:23.611 --> 49:26.978
Just careful not to
attract too much attention.

49:26.980 --> 49:27.913
Yeah, I'm not.

49:27.915 --> 49:29.582
I'm just being really quiet.

49:29.584 --> 49:31.317
- Okay.
- Because people are

49:31.319 --> 49:33.853
kind of like not
really trusting.

49:33.855 --> 49:35.620
- Yeah.
- There's word that

49:35.622 --> 49:38.591
there might be some
infiltrators or people

49:38.593 --> 49:40.261
who get along with the officers.

50:13.627 --> 50:14.928
Found our guy, boss.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.169
So you're back.

50:22.602 --> 50:23.736
Who do you work for?

50:23.738 --> 50:25.004
I'm not working for anyone.

50:25.006 --> 50:27.105
Are you a lawyer?

50:27.107 --> 50:27.940
No.

50:27.942 --> 50:28.940
I'm visiting a detainee.

50:28.942 --> 50:30.044
I made an appointment.

50:34.815 --> 50:36.982
I don't know
what you're up to,

50:36.984 --> 50:39.884
but from now on things are
gonna be very different.

50:39.886 --> 50:40.787
Get him out.

50:44.792 --> 50:46.558
The facility came up with
a new policy that said,

50:46.560 --> 50:47.960
"Oh, you're not allowed
to bring documents

50:47.962 --> 50:49.228
"in if you're just a visitor."

50:49.230 --> 50:50.328
Kind of freaking out because

50:50.330 --> 50:51.629
without the privacy waiver,

50:51.631 --> 50:53.332
we can't get people
out in a day or two,

50:53.334 --> 50:54.900
we can't get members
of Congress moving

50:54.902 --> 50:56.701
because they all need
this permission slip.

52:17.752 --> 52:18.583
Okay.

52:18.585 --> 52:19.417
Okay.

53:02.330 --> 53:04.799
Samuel had just
seen his name on the board.

53:06.834 --> 53:08.900
In 48 hours he's
gonna be loaded up

53:08.902 --> 53:10.738
on a plane and sent
back to Honduras.

53:11.939 --> 53:13.839
Here he had an American wife

53:13.841 --> 53:15.276
and four citizen children.

53:16.410 --> 53:19.212
Back there gangs had
killed his two brothers.

53:46.707 --> 53:47.873
Does he have a
criminal record?

53:47.875 --> 53:50.442
Has he ever been
arrested besides this?

53:50.444 --> 53:52.277
According to ICE
policy your husband's

53:52.279 --> 53:54.045
not supposed to be
in there at all.

53:54.047 --> 53:55.580
And he is.

53:55.582 --> 53:57.716
So would you be willing
to make your case public?

53:57.718 --> 53:58.886
Are you okay with that?

54:00.555 --> 54:02.120
These are my four kids.

54:02.122 --> 54:05.992
My husband was stopped by the
police on the way to work.

54:07.395 --> 54:10.261
He was arrested for
havin' an expired license.

54:10.263 --> 54:13.199
At this moment he could be
deported, at any moment,

54:13.201 --> 54:16.167
and my kids are gonna
be without a father.

54:23.444 --> 54:25.109
- Another break?
- No, Sir.

54:25.111 --> 54:26.545
- Get up!
- It's my first break.

54:26.547 --> 54:27.946
Every time I turn around
you're sitting down.

54:27.948 --> 54:28.880
No, that's not true.

54:28.882 --> 54:29.815
Please, boss, it's not true.

54:31.585 --> 54:32.984
Get to work.

54:41.661 --> 54:44.062
Hey, Ashan, are you okay?

54:44.064 --> 54:45.230
What was that all about?

54:45.232 --> 54:46.066
Who cares?

54:47.535 --> 54:48.835
The guy's an ass.

54:50.471 --> 54:52.139
Yeah, he's an asshole.

54:55.076 --> 54:55.910
All right, man.

54:57.178 --> 54:57.978
Hey?

55:00.214 --> 55:02.650
Are you still giving
out that number?

55:04.085 --> 55:05.753
My friends called it.

55:06.687 --> 55:07.520
When?

55:08.622 --> 55:09.656
A week ago.

55:10.757 --> 55:11.589
What'd they say?

55:11.591 --> 55:12.425
I'm not sure.

55:13.627 --> 55:17.897
I think Mohammad is
trying to help him.

55:21.167 --> 55:22.368
God help me.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.147
Samuel had
been taken to processing.

55:36.149 --> 55:37.317
Time was running out.

55:38.486 --> 55:40.421
We had to get his
paperwork out, now.

56:31.238 --> 56:32.870
Hey Ashan.

56:32.872 --> 56:33.707
Hey.

56:37.745 --> 56:39.846
Hey, I was wondering,

56:41.415 --> 56:43.451
and it's okay if
you don't want to,

56:46.986 --> 56:48.888
but would you be
able to do something?

56:50.757 --> 56:52.225
It's not for me, it's for...

56:54.060 --> 56:55.326
For Mohammad?

57:08.542 --> 57:10.208
Samuel's
asylum application,

57:10.210 --> 57:13.679
13 privacy waivers and a
letter to mom promising

57:13.681 --> 57:15.080
I'll come back to help
with the restaurant

57:15.082 --> 57:16.815
if I ever get outta here.

58:09.569 --> 58:10.835
All
right, here we go.

58:10.837 --> 58:12.603
Step out, watch your step.

58:12.605 --> 58:13.406
Single file.

58:14.607 --> 58:16.042
Single file, watch your step.

58:17.143 --> 58:18.243
Come on.

58:24.652 --> 58:25.683
Yes, I have somebody
that's being deported

58:25.685 --> 58:27.920
in a couple hours and I was told

58:27.922 --> 58:31.625
to call headquarters and speak
to somebody who's on call.

58:33.627 --> 58:34.792
It's very urgent.

58:34.794 --> 58:35.828
We filed an emergency
stay of removal

58:35.830 --> 58:37.062
and there hasn't been a decision

58:37.064 --> 58:38.230
and we haven't heard anything

58:38.232 --> 58:39.630
but the family
member contacted us

58:39.632 --> 58:42.236
and said they're being deported
at five in the morning.

58:51.078 --> 58:53.346
Samuel Rosales.

59:14.567 --> 59:15.835
Come with me.

59:21.774 --> 59:23.007
Come with me.

59:44.631 --> 59:47.632
Beni, you gotta
help us out, buddy.

59:47.634 --> 59:48.669
We got a job to do.

59:58.279 --> 01:00:01.148
Miss Moran, I'm
here with Beni.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.420
No.

01:00:08.422 --> 01:00:09.757
Hello?

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:16.728
We just need a
minute to discuss

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.062
a few things with him.

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:07.212
Clear the yard.

01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:31.803
You're coming
with us, asshole.

01:01:31.805 --> 01:01:32.504
- No, no, no, no!
- We're putting

01:01:32.506 --> 01:01:33.337
you on a plane.

01:01:33.339 --> 01:01:34.772
No, no!

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:35.707
God damn
it, you're comin'.

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:37.908
No, no, no, no.

01:01:57.096 --> 01:01:58.399
I had my birthday in there.

01:02:00.868 --> 01:02:03.835
So I remember talking
to Mo and saying like,

01:02:03.837 --> 01:02:05.036
"I don't know how much longer

01:02:05.038 --> 01:02:07.272
"I'm gonna be able
to stay here."

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:15.746
Hey, Neema, you want my biscuit?

01:02:15.748 --> 01:02:18.651
Ever since I did time at
McDonald's I stay away from them.

01:02:20.353 --> 01:02:21.821
I was quiet back then.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.091
My mom used to say ,

01:02:27.895 --> 01:02:30.261
which means like, I
never broke a plate,

01:02:30.263 --> 01:02:34.766
but it really means
like, I was careful,

01:02:34.768 --> 01:02:36.203
always followed the rules.

01:02:38.138 --> 01:02:38.971
You?

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:45.609
Well, I always followed
the rules, big time.

01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:47.180
Graduated top of my class.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:52.553
And then I learned that
I couldn't go to college,

01:02:53.786 --> 01:02:55.723
so I had to learn
how to make biscuits.

01:02:59.493 --> 01:03:03.161
I shoulda just partied by
ass off in high school.

01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:31.183
What you sayin'?

01:04:31.185 --> 01:04:34.421
If the group does it
then I'll do it, too.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.496
If we do it as a group then

01:04:45.498 --> 01:04:46.665
we can get a lot
of media attention.

01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:48.433
Listen to Mr. TV now.

01:04:48.435 --> 01:04:49.667
No, but listen.

01:04:49.669 --> 01:04:51.437
What is the point if
no one's watching?

01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:29.276
30 days?

01:06:05.978 --> 01:06:08.647
He's fasting right now
for like, this is, what?

01:06:08.649 --> 01:06:10.784
16 days maybe, already.

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:13.352
Tomorrow will be like 17.

01:06:14.453 --> 01:06:16.221
So, that's another
thing that concerns me,

01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:17.656
'cause I don't know how he is.

01:06:17.658 --> 01:06:19.156
Like, he talks on the phone

01:06:19.158 --> 01:06:21.359
and he said that he's fine but,

01:06:21.361 --> 01:06:23.194
like I don't see him,
I don't see his face,

01:06:23.196 --> 01:06:25.330
I don't see his
expressions and stuff,

01:06:25.332 --> 01:06:27.364
so, it worries me a lot.

01:06:30.603 --> 01:06:32.071
- Claudio?
- Hey.

01:06:51.959 --> 01:06:54.661
The plan was that
Mo would go to the media,

01:06:55.562 --> 01:06:57.696
go public with the campaign,

01:06:57.698 --> 01:06:59.466
put national pressure on ICE.

01:07:00.334 --> 01:07:01.969
But no one was taking the story.

01:07:26.593 --> 01:07:27.426
What?

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.372
- Hey look.
- What?

01:07:40.607 --> 01:07:41.440
Neema.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.060
It is true?

01:08:02.062 --> 01:08:06.031
Everyone was like.

01:08:06.033 --> 01:08:09.634
And oh my,.

01:08:17.144 --> 01:08:17.978
Viri?

01:08:21.814 --> 01:08:22.648
Yeah?

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:28.453
If you go public, will
my name be on the news?

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:31.455
We don't have
to use your name.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:33.292
- It could just be...
- No.

01:08:35.162 --> 01:08:36.997
I want my husband to see.

01:08:38.398 --> 01:08:40.432
Her name is Neema,
she's from Congo.

01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:43.033
Her husband was beating
her and she finally

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.201
went to the cops to turn him in.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.435
Like, she thought she was doing

01:08:45.438 --> 01:08:47.703
the right thing and
they detained her.

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:49.240
She's been here for
almost three years

01:08:49.242 --> 01:08:52.676
and she hasn't been able to
see her son the whole time.

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:54.145
Yeah, three years.

01:09:17.938 --> 01:09:18.872
Mr. TV man.

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.839
You saw it?

01:09:21.841 --> 01:09:23.175
We want to join the fast.

01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:36.122
He said we're gonna
bring down the wall.

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.957
- Line up, please.
- Viridiana Martinez,

01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:40.124
welcome to "Democracy Now!"

01:09:40.126 --> 01:09:42.593
Why were you willing
to be arrested

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.828
and deported to find out what

01:09:44.831 --> 01:09:46.930
was happening inside this jail?

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:49.267
I have
found several stories

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:53.237
of women who have been
held for over a year.

01:09:53.238 --> 01:09:55.039
We want the immediate release

01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:58.042
of all low priority
cases here at Broward.

01:10:02.515 --> 01:10:03.415
What now?

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.389
We stop eating with the men.

01:10:14.027 --> 01:10:15.026
Stop eating?

01:10:21.768 --> 01:10:25.005
The men
are already doing it.

01:10:38.018 --> 01:10:39.319
Food sucks anyway, right?

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:41.819
Let's do it.

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:48.092
This is
months before the election.

01:10:48.094 --> 01:10:49.526
Elaine where have

01:10:49.528 --> 01:10:51.161
the candidates been
focusing in Florida lately?

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:52.362
It's pretty evenly split

01:10:52.364 --> 01:10:53.865
between republicans
and democrats.

01:10:53.867 --> 01:10:57.834
However, there is also a large
group of Hispanic voters.

01:10:57.836 --> 01:10:59.137
Obama needs the Latino vote.

01:10:59.139 --> 01:11:00.707
He's going after
the Latino vote.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:03.106
We have sort of
a national effort

01:11:03.108 --> 01:11:05.142
with the petition and
everything online trying

01:11:05.144 --> 01:11:07.344
to push for these
deportations to be stopped.

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.713
Claudio Rojas, he's
an Argentinian father

01:11:09.715 --> 01:11:11.382
whose been in there
since February,

01:11:11.384 --> 01:11:12.616
and he's actually the reason

01:11:12.618 --> 01:11:14.619
why we even infiltrated
this detention center.

01:11:14.621 --> 01:11:16.286
If Obama was serious
about all of this,

01:11:16.288 --> 01:11:17.888
he could just give us an
executive order, very simple,

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:20.624
and that's something
that is an actual law

01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:22.793
that has to be followed
with actual rules

01:11:22.795 --> 01:11:24.561
and actual accountability.

01:11:44.951 --> 01:11:47.852
Hey, so this group you're
workin' with, who are they?

01:11:47.854 --> 01:11:49.823
The National Immigrant
Youth Alliance.

01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:54.424
What exactly do they want?

01:11:54.426 --> 01:11:56.060
What do they want?

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:56.863
Freedom.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:04.067
Wait.

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:06.005
Wait, hold on, hold on.

01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:17.450
Handle this fool.

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:20.651
Hey.

01:12:20.653 --> 01:12:22.853
Hey, are you okay?

01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:23.689
- What...
- Quiet.

01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:39.436
Warden?

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:40.871
They're here.

01:12:40.873 --> 01:12:41.707
Sit.

01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:48.614
We've reviewed your cases.

01:12:49.715 --> 01:12:51.050
You're both here illegally.

01:12:52.519 --> 01:12:54.220
You both have prior arrests.

01:12:57.056 --> 01:13:00.924
But today I got some good news.

01:13:00.926 --> 01:13:03.063
You both qualified
for immediate release.

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:05.799
Release?

01:13:06.733 --> 01:13:08.399
Yeah, immediately.

01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:09.633
Just like that?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.767
Oh, we'll give
you a few minutes

01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:12.071
to pull your
belongings together.

01:13:13.206 --> 01:13:15.673
What changed about our case?

01:13:15.675 --> 01:13:17.208
Look, all I need is the name

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.913
and address of the person
that's comin' to pick ya up.

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:26.419
We need to make a phone call.

01:13:53.813 --> 01:13:54.945
You got
that name for me?

01:13:54.947 --> 01:13:55.914
Actually several.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.084
We're not leavin' until
these men get released.

01:14:00.086 --> 01:14:01.020
What did you say?

01:14:02.921 --> 01:14:04.321
You gotta be kidding me.

01:14:04.323 --> 01:14:05.757
These women deserve
to be released

01:14:05.759 --> 01:14:07.191
just as much as I do.

01:14:17.136 --> 01:14:19.236
On my list, Claudio Rojas.

01:14:19.238 --> 01:14:20.339
He has a family here.

01:14:23.675 --> 01:14:27.145
Maria Soledad is a political
refugee from Venezuela.

01:14:27.147 --> 01:14:30.647
Are you really planning to
send her home to be killed?

01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:32.182
Would you please just give me

01:14:32.184 --> 01:14:35.253
the name and address of the
person comin' to pick you up?

01:14:46.366 --> 01:14:47.597
Stop right there.

01:14:47.599 --> 01:14:48.399
We came
to pick up Viridiana.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.066
Just stay right here.

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:51.535
They'll bring her out.

01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:52.969
Why can't
we just come pick her up?

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.273
- 'Cause I said no.
- 51.

01:14:55.175 --> 01:14:56.673
10/4.

01:14:56.675 --> 01:14:58.611
It's about, it's 15 people.

01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:00.679
I'm not leaving.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.647
We're not leaving.

01:15:15.795 --> 01:15:17.794
We have a
situation in the courtyard.

01:15:17.796 --> 01:15:19.696
We need boots on the ground.

01:15:26.072 --> 01:15:27.538
The Broward County Sheriff's
Office has been called.

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.008
In 10 minutes you can
walk out or be hauled out.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.727
Everyone needs a plan,

01:15:49.162 --> 01:15:51.561
but sometimes you
have to improvise.

01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:15.919
Stand back, stand back.

01:16:15.921 --> 01:16:19.155
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:21.093
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.597
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:16:26.299 --> 01:16:28.399
Now you're not scared?

01:16:28.401 --> 01:16:29.566
Please leave

01:16:29.568 --> 01:16:30.935
- our property now.
- My name is Viridiana.

01:16:30.937 --> 01:16:32.235
That's nice.

01:16:32.237 --> 01:16:33.538
I don't work for you.

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.472
- Viridiana, Viridiana?
- Please go.

01:16:34.474 --> 01:16:35.740
What is the fear?

01:16:35.742 --> 01:16:38.676
I don't understand
what the fear is?

01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:41.279
Bye, Viridiana.

01:16:41.281 --> 01:16:42.847
- But I wanna know...
- Another two more weeks.

01:16:46.286 --> 01:16:48.018
You want me to leave but where

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.721
are the other people
that need to be out here

01:16:50.723 --> 01:16:52.789
that should not be held inside,

01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:54.258
and yet they still are
and they're waiting

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.663
for answers and nobody
will give us answers.

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:03.366
Marco?

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:04.901
Marco?

01:17:04.903 --> 01:17:06.369
Marco, woo!

01:17:23.156 --> 01:17:24.254
Hey.

01:17:24.256 --> 01:17:26.757
Oh, good to see you out.

01:17:26.759 --> 01:17:28.459
- Hey, how you doin'?
- You got a new shirt.

01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.694
Yeah.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.130
How are you?

01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:43.341
- That sounds good.
- Aw, they're gonna get out.

01:17:43.343 --> 01:17:46.110
- Yeah.
- You mom is coming...

01:17:46.112 --> 01:17:47.878
In every family
I have been able

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.417
to see my own family
and that's sacred.

01:17:52.652 --> 01:17:54.187
Family is sacred.

01:17:55.621 --> 01:17:58.455
What would I want someone
to do for my family?

01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:10.234
Hurry up.

01:18:26.019 --> 01:18:28.121
Gather your belongings.

01:19:08.294 --> 01:19:09.927
I can pick you up!

01:19:09.929 --> 01:19:11.962
I'm picking my wife up!

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:13.731
It's hard to be
in there to like,

01:19:13.733 --> 01:19:16.232
- just trust whoever you know.
- Yeah.

01:19:16.234 --> 01:19:17.435
Like there's a lot at stake.

01:19:17.437 --> 01:19:18.735
Hey, how are you?

01:19:18.737 --> 01:19:19.869
- Good, good.
- How are you?

01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:21.705
Good, good, how are you?

01:19:21.707 --> 01:19:22.873
- Oh man.
- Long drive?

01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:25.308
Oh man, you have no idea.

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:26.746
You have no idea.

01:19:27.913 --> 01:19:29.346
- Okay.
- What the hell?

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.481
Oh my God.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.419

01:19:55.575 --> 01:19:56.707
Infiltrating!

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:57.775
Infiltrating!

01:19:57.777 --> 01:19:58.609
2012!

01:20:03.248 --> 01:20:04.582
Thank you so much.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:23.669
We have to put you in
isolation for your own safety.

01:20:24.836 --> 01:20:26.803
You lost 12 pounds
in the last 10 days

01:20:26.805 --> 01:20:29.541
and we're worried
about your health.

01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:03.807
Okay.

01:21:03.809 --> 01:21:05.042
Bye.

01:21:05.044 --> 01:21:06.843
360 people didn't
go to breakfast,

01:21:06.845 --> 01:21:09.379
but they're saying that
it's even smaller now.

01:21:09.381 --> 01:21:11.384
The people that are
lining up for meals.

01:21:17.657 --> 01:21:21.525
Claudio told me that he
had already lost his family.

01:21:21.527 --> 01:21:23.429
What else does he have to lose?

01:21:24.596 --> 01:21:27.063
So, I'm choosing
to go back in jail

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.833
again as a symbol knowing that

01:21:28.835 --> 01:21:33.840
I will see my mother
Natalia, my father Antonio,

01:21:34.706 --> 01:21:37.274
my sister Yahida and Carolina.

01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:39.310
And believing that
that same organizing

01:21:39.312 --> 01:21:41.411
will allow Claudio
to see Emiliano

01:21:41.413 --> 01:21:43.549
and his wife and son again.

01:21:56.729 --> 01:21:57.695
The fact that you're all here,

01:21:57.697 --> 01:21:59.195
they're gonna see that on the TV

01:21:59.197 --> 01:22:01.030
and they're gonna be
able to wake up tomorrow

01:22:01.032 --> 01:22:02.900
and have more hope
than they did today.

01:22:02.902 --> 01:22:06.005
So every time you
chant, you chant loud.

01:22:07.206 --> 01:22:08.571
Undocumented!

01:22:08.573 --> 01:22:10.074
Unafraid!

01:22:10.076 --> 01:22:11.107
Undocumented!

01:22:11.109 --> 01:22:12.243
Unafraid!

01:22:12.245 --> 01:22:13.477
Undocumented!

01:22:13.479 --> 01:22:14.477
Unafraid!

01:22:14.479 --> 01:22:15.779
Undocumented!

01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:16.713
Unafraid!

01:22:16.715 --> 01:22:18.015
Undocumented!

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:18.949
Unafraid!

01:23:03.996 --> 01:23:05.195
These folks don't
have drivers license.

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:06.129
They can't visit their
families in there.

01:23:06.131 --> 01:23:07.630
They're tried everything else.

01:23:07.632 --> 01:23:08.665
They're tried the senator,
they've tried everything

01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:11.000
and unfortunately it feels like

01:23:11.002 --> 01:23:13.670
they've read some civil
rights books and I don't know.

01:23:13.672 --> 01:23:14.605
Undocumented!

01:23:14.607 --> 01:23:15.739
Unafraid!

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:16.973
Undocumented!

01:23:16.975 --> 01:23:18.142
Unafraid!

01:23:18.144 --> 01:23:19.043
Undocumented!

01:23:19.045 --> 01:23:20.177
Unafraid!

01:23:20.179 --> 01:23:21.344
Undocumented!

01:23:21.346 --> 01:23:22.378
Unafraid!

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.513
Undocumented!

01:23:23.515 --> 01:23:24.448
Unafraid!

01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:25.316
Undocumented!

01:23:25.318 --> 01:23:26.650
Unafraid!

01:23:26.652 --> 01:23:28.584
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:30.687
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:23:30.689 --> 01:23:32.789
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:34.924
Undocumented, unafraid.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:36.927
Undocumented, unafraid!

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.691
Going into
Broward we kinda jokingly said

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.929
that we were just gonna
bring it to a halt.

01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:22.865
It was an out of
control facility

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:25.437
just by the simple fact
that people were empowered.

01:25:26.505 --> 01:25:28.739
They're not trained to deal

01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:30.542
with people who
hold their heads up.

01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:34.511
In my perfect world, I
wouldn't be a part of it.

01:25:34.513 --> 01:25:36.679
I would've been able
to go to college

01:25:36.681 --> 01:25:38.451
and I would've been
living my life.

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:43.589
Currently, I work
at my family's restaurant.

01:25:46.358 --> 01:25:49.195
I'm involved in the
Immigrant Rights Movement.

01:25:50.595 --> 01:25:51.861
I don't know how I think about

01:25:51.863 --> 01:25:53.696
the decision now but
I definitely have

01:25:53.698 --> 01:25:55.731
more hesitancy now
than I did back then.

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:56.900
Let's take a look

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.368
at the electoral
college map right now.

01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:01.370
With that win in Wisconsin,
look at how close he is.

01:26:01.372 --> 01:26:04.641
Right now he has
257 electoral votes.

01:26:04.643 --> 01:26:06.142
He needs 13 more.

01:26:06.144 --> 01:26:09.245
270 to be elected President
of the United States.

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:12.048
He is getting incredibly,
incredibly close.

01:26:17.555 --> 01:26:19.991
Now people will
believe the worst.

01:26:24.162 --> 01:26:27.830
My husband is currently
in an immigration jail.

01:26:30.336 --> 01:26:32.936
I have three kids
that depend on him.

01:27:03.469 --> 01:27:04.901
Outrage
turning into frustration

01:27:04.903 --> 01:27:07.271
and tears as a mom is deported.

01:27:07.273 --> 01:27:09.573
Her family members say she was
trying to do the right thing.

01:27:09.575 --> 01:27:11.477
Checking in with
ICE is required.

01:27:48.027 --> 01:27:50.280
