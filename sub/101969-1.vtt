[indistinct chatter]

00:57.857 --> 00:59.492
[Richard] Another, sir?

00:59.525 --> 01:00.560
Keep them coming.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.199

03:27.706 --> 03:28.575
Oh, crap.

03:47.626 --> 03:48.728
And you are?

03:49.762 --> 03:52.699
Dragon. Richard Dragon.

05:20.052 --> 05:22.355
[thunder rumbling]

05:25.858 --> 05:26.726
[bats screeching]

05:51.083 --> 05:53.452
He is... preoccupied.

05:53.485 --> 05:54.454
[woman giggling]

05:59.158 --> 06:01.694
He'll want to hear this.

06:01.727 --> 06:03.096
-[woman giggling]
-Come.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.599
I'm sorry to interrupt...

06:06.632 --> 06:08.567
No, no, Schlangenfaust.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.136
We're quite finished here.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.071
What is it?

06:12.104 --> 06:14.607
[Schlangenfaust]
One of our facilities
in France was...

06:14.640 --> 06:15.708
compromised.

06:16.508 --> 06:17.643
And?

06:17.676 --> 06:19.812
Someone knows we have The Gate.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.649
Then you know what to do.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.922
[door opens and closes]

06:33.592 --> 06:37.163
I'm afraid our time
has come to an end.

06:37.196 --> 06:40.766
Honey, in my line of work,
it always does.

06:40.799 --> 06:41.834
But, you know,

06:41.867 --> 06:43.736
if you need any more help,

06:44.870 --> 06:46.506
I'm only a phone call away.

06:48.807 --> 06:49.742
Indeed.

[breathing heavily]

07:08.060 --> 07:08.928
[gasps]

07:10.996 --> 07:12.465
Dance for me.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.235
[sarcastically]
Real funny, wise guy.

07:16.268 --> 07:17.870
Now, open the door.

07:17.903 --> 07:19.572
You aren't the only customer
I have tonight.

07:20.906 --> 07:24.477
[whispering] Dance... for me.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.045
I'm not dancing for you.
You dig?

07:26.078 --> 07:27.680
[shouting] Now open
the damn door!

07:29.648 --> 07:31.083
-You hear me, freak?
-[chamber opens]

07:53.171 --> 07:54.240

Oh, please! God!

07:54.273 --> 07:55.141
No, no!

07:56.608 --> 07:57.810
This isn't funny!

07:59.044 --> 08:01.013
[screaming]

08:01.046 --> 08:04.016
Open the door! Open the door!

08:07.019 --> 08:11.190

Please, no! Please!

-[squeaking]

08:13.292 --> 08:15.828

08:16.895 --> 08:19.265

[funky music playing in club]

09:05.844 --> 09:08.047
Hey. Slow down, Charlie Chan.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.715
There's a line.

09:09.748 --> 09:10.983
I'm not here for the music.

09:11.016 --> 09:12.151
I'm a friend of the owner.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.287
Buddy, I know karate.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.122
So, how about you
get out of here,

09:17.155 --> 09:18.791
before I kick your ass?

09:19.291 --> 09:20.759
Karate?

09:20.792 --> 09:22.761
That stuff only works
in the movies.

09:22.794 --> 09:25.864
Oh, I assure you,
it's very real.

09:25.897 --> 09:28.033
Why don't you show me?

09:28.066 --> 09:30.035
I'll even let you have
the first shot.

09:30.068 --> 09:32.071
[knuckles cracking]

09:32.104 --> 09:33.839
Don't say I didn't warn you.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.308
Not here.

09:36.408 --> 09:37.577
In there.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.116
You're about to enter
a world of hurt.

09:44.149 --> 09:46.185
I'm going to enjoy this,
you little--

09:46.218 --> 09:47.753
[gate closes]

09:47.786 --> 09:50.656
Hey! What are you doing?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.826
Come back here!

09:53.859 --> 09:56.862
[shouting]
Somebody get the key!
Hey! Hey!

09:57.696 --> 09:59.031
Come on, man!

10:03.735 --> 10:05.871
[Silver]
I'm sorry, Bruce.

10:05.904 --> 10:07.139
But it's just not enough.

10:08.173 --> 10:10.242
Look... I love you.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.878
And, I know you love me.

10:12.911 --> 10:16.248
What we have together
is rare. Special.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.652
But after all these months,

10:19.685 --> 10:22.221
there's still a part of you
that I just can't reach.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.257
I know it sounds ridiculous,

10:25.290 --> 10:27.059
but it's like there's some...

10:27.826 --> 10:30.195
dark secret.

10:30.228 --> 10:31.998
Something you're hiding
from me.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.737
Whatever it is, just tell me.

10:38.770 --> 10:39.905
We'll face it together.

10:41.873 --> 10:45.144
Silver, honey,
it's not like that.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.145
There's nothing...

10:47.713 --> 10:49.715
Just... tell me.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.221
I can't.

11:04.896 --> 11:05.898
[jingling sounds]

11:12.838 --> 11:15.708
-Silver...
-Don't call me. Ever.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.349
Excuse me.

11:30.088 --> 11:30.990
Bad time?

11:33.158 --> 11:34.159
Richard?

11:34.192 --> 11:35.761
Sorry about barging in.

11:35.794 --> 11:37.162
I can come back.

11:37.195 --> 11:39.031
No. No. Please.

11:39.998 --> 11:41.300
It's good to see you.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.401
Can I make you a drink?

11:43.769 --> 11:46.472
Sure. Nice pad.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.440
How long has it been?

11:48.473 --> 11:50.876
I can't think of the last time
we saw each other.

11:50.909 --> 11:52.177
Really?

11:52.210 --> 11:54.113
I bet you can remember
the last time.

11:54.146 --> 11:55.414
The first time, too.

11:57.048 --> 11:57.983
Yeah.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.456
-[wind blowing]
-[grunting and panting]

12:54.005 --> 12:54.874
[grunts]

13:05.617 --> 13:06.952
[echoing] Hello?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.922
Anybody?

13:12.257 --> 13:13.559
I've come a long...

13:16.394 --> 13:17.263
way.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.302
Screw you, then.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.843
[door rumbles]

13:32.944 --> 13:33.813
[thuds]

13:37.582 --> 13:38.484
[creaking]

13:42.954 --> 13:43.823
[O-Sensei] Welcome.

13:44.589 --> 13:46.458
We've been expecting you.

13:47.559 --> 13:50.362
No one answered when I knocked.

13:50.395 --> 13:54.933
The door to destiny
is always open...

13:54.966 --> 13:58.304
if you are brave enough
to walk through it.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.209
Now shut the door
before you let the heat out.

14:09.614 --> 14:11.483
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

14:20.258 --> 14:24.196
To find this place
took great skill and courage.

14:24.229 --> 14:25.931
You'll need both.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.368
Yes, O-Sensei.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.203
I'm eager to learn.

14:31.236 --> 14:32.538
They all say that...

14:33.371 --> 14:35.173
at the beginning.

14:35.206 --> 14:37.442
-They?
-Yes.

14:37.475 --> 14:38.978
You'll be the sixth.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.583
Shiva. My best student.

14:44.616 --> 14:47.286
Disciplined. Honorable.

14:48.186 --> 14:49.054
[blade whistling]

15:00.966 --> 15:04.403
You can expect
a speech from her
at graduation.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.707
That is Ben Turner.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.576
-[Ben grunting]
-Strong and fierce.

15:11.609 --> 15:15.247
He came here, seeking a way
to control his temper.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.684
[grunting and growling]

15:18.717 --> 15:19.585
[breathing heavily]

15:22.520 --> 15:24.156
We're still working on that.

15:36.368 --> 15:37.469
That one is Jade.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.106
[grunting]

15:47.445 --> 15:48.981
A good student,

15:49.014 --> 15:51.350
but she is always
asking questions.

15:52.283 --> 15:54.186
Makes my head hurt.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.156
And then, Rip.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.292
A decorated war hero,

16:00.325 --> 16:01.760
now looking for peace.

16:01.793 --> 16:03.362
He's very dedicated.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.235
Also, he makes
an excellent bowl of chili.

16:10.268 --> 16:11.270
You said six.

16:12.804 --> 16:15.240
Oh, yes. [chuckles] Yes.

16:15.273 --> 16:19.144
He's been here so long,
I sometimes forget he's here.

16:24.616 --> 16:25.484
[grunting]

16:32.624 --> 16:34.626
That is Richard.

16:34.659 --> 16:37.162
Richard Dragon.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.631
Each are unique
in their own way,

16:39.664 --> 16:41.199
as you will be.

16:41.232 --> 16:44.169
Now, I have shown you
the grounds.

16:44.202 --> 16:45.237
Where does that lead?

16:46.237 --> 16:49.641
-What?
-That. The door.

16:49.674 --> 16:52.511
It's set apart from
the rest of the buildings.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.645
You didn't mention it.

16:57.449 --> 17:01.086
Didn't I? Richard!

17:01.119 --> 17:03.689
Show our new recruit
to his quarters.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.429
Bruce.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.098
This road is not an easy one.

17:13.131 --> 17:17.036
It often leads to ruin
for those unfit to walk it.

17:18.336 --> 17:19.705
You can still leave.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.776
No, Sensei. I can't.

17:37.555 --> 17:40.225
So, what brings you to Gotham?

17:40.258 --> 17:41.526
Always to the point.

17:41.559 --> 17:44.096
You haven't changed
at all, Bruce.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.264
You might be surprised.

17:46.197 --> 17:47.499
Someone has The Gate.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.369
So, you came here?

17:51.402 --> 17:52.471
What am I gonna do?

17:54.339 --> 17:55.674
Help me find it.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.243
Me? No, no.

17:58.276 --> 18:00.212
In between the club downstairs,

18:00.245 --> 18:02.647
charity functions,
my father's business--

18:02.680 --> 18:04.883
Trouble with your lady.

18:04.916 --> 18:08.720
Right. My calendar
is pretty full.

18:08.753 --> 18:11.289
Now if you need some money,
I'm happy to write a check,

18:11.322 --> 18:12.791
but the other stuff,

18:13.658 --> 18:15.160
those days are over.

18:16.227 --> 18:17.329
[Richard]
That's too bad.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.703
You and I both know
the skills we've acquired
don't fade that easily.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.805
Besides, aren't you
some sort of

18:26.838 --> 18:29.508
globe-trotting super spy now?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.143
Why the hell do you need me?

18:31.176 --> 18:32.577
My employers
would try to open it.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.312
Use it to their benefit.

18:34.345 --> 18:37.449
I can't do this alone.
I need someone I can trust.

18:37.482 --> 18:39.384
Someone to see it through
to the end.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.253
And you, Bruce,

18:41.286 --> 18:43.688
are just about
the most driven man
I've ever known.

18:43.721 --> 18:46.525
Sorry, Richard.
I have my own scene going on.

18:47.892 --> 18:50.129
Yes. I can see that.

18:58.770 --> 18:59.905
[chattering on televisions]

19:06.778 --> 19:10.448
I need to keep an eye
on the patrons.

19:10.481 --> 19:13.518
Afraid they're gonna
rip off your napkins?

19:13.551 --> 19:15.420
The truck will be there
at midnight.

19:15.453 --> 19:16.855
What about the cops?

19:16.888 --> 19:18.390
[scoffs] With what
we're paying them,

19:18.423 --> 19:20.325
they'll help load the drugs!

19:20.358 --> 19:21.593
Whatever this is,

19:21.626 --> 19:23.428
it's not as important
as The Gate.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.634
We owe him.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.839
All right. Let's hear it.

19:36.507 --> 19:38.710
Terrorist group
got their hands on The Gate.

19:38.743 --> 19:42.214
A week later,
the terrorists were all dead.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.582
Tying up loose ends.

19:44.582 --> 19:45.817
You're a loose end.

19:45.850 --> 19:46.885
That's why I came.

19:46.918 --> 19:48.353
[screaming and shouting on TV]

19:53.625 --> 19:54.593
[all screaming]

19:55.693 --> 19:56.795
[crashing]

19:59.597 --> 20:03.668
[Axe Gang member]
Give us the sword
and your death will be quick.

20:03.701 --> 20:06.405
Let's hope knife catching
isn't the only skill
you remember.

20:08.506 --> 20:09.508
[grunting]

20:27.825 --> 20:28.694
[growls]

20:33.698 --> 20:34.766
[growls]

20:44.075 --> 20:46.278
[O-Sensei] The stone
is indomitable.

20:46.944 --> 20:48.680
But, it is just a thing.

20:48.713 --> 20:50.649
Physical in nature.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.883
But, you...

20:51.916 --> 20:55.520
you are much more
than the physical.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.723
Everyday, you will
hit the stone.

20:58.756 --> 21:01.727
It will hurt,
but pain strengthens us.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.996
It will burn,

21:05.029 --> 21:07.432
but fire cleanses the soul.

21:08.766 --> 21:12.037
And then, someday... maybe...

21:12.070 --> 21:13.505
the stone will break.

21:14.906 --> 21:17.309
But, the journey
will make your spirit

21:17.342 --> 21:20.412
as indomitable as that stone.

21:22.847 --> 21:23.715
Begin!

21:26.951 --> 21:28.987
[all grunting]

21:52.744 --> 21:54.012
Giving up already, mama?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.353
If teacher's pet
doesn't have to do it,

22:01.386 --> 22:02.754
I'm not doing it either.

22:04.455 --> 22:06.491
Man says
the stone's going to break.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.760
I'm going to break it! [growls]

22:09.627 --> 22:11.063
[all grunting]

22:16.434 --> 22:17.769
[grunting continues]

22:33.718 --> 22:34.619
[Ben growls]

22:36.421 --> 22:38.156
Man, this is bullshit!

22:38.189 --> 22:39.591
[growls]

22:39.624 --> 22:40.592
[clanging]

22:42.927 --> 22:44.963
Ben, come on.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.898
Naw. Have fun
breaking your hands.

22:46.931 --> 22:49.568
I'm done, baby. [scoffs]

22:50.701 --> 22:52.504
Maybe he's right.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.506
Maybe we should turn in.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.608
[Bruce grunting]

23:04.782 --> 23:05.884
Good night, Bruce.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.497
[groaning]

23:19.597 --> 23:21.099
-[O-Sensei] Bruce.
-[gasps]

23:21.132 --> 23:23.034
I didn't see you.

23:23.067 --> 23:26.538
Darkness is a powerful ally,

23:26.571 --> 23:29.674
if you know how to befriend it.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.976
You will not break
the rock tonight.

23:32.009 --> 23:35.447
Or tomorrow. Or the next day.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.148
Or perhaps ever.

23:37.181 --> 23:40.652
You said to break the rock.

23:40.685 --> 23:43.855
I said to try
to break the rock.

23:45.523 --> 23:47.492
I know what happened to you...

23:47.525 --> 23:48.560
to your family.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.695
The whole world knows.

23:50.728 --> 23:54.732
Now, you want to stop that
from happening to anyone else.

23:54.765 --> 23:58.470
But, evil is as eternal
as this rock.

23:59.637 --> 24:01.606
Even if you break the rock,

24:01.639 --> 24:02.974
there will be pebbles,

24:03.007 --> 24:05.944
break the pebbles,
there will be sand,

24:05.977 --> 24:07.912
and evil remains.

24:07.945 --> 24:09.581
You cannot change that,

24:09.614 --> 24:11.750
no matter how much you train.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.955
Accept what you cannot change.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.257
It is not your burden to bear.

24:19.290 --> 24:22.961
Life is meant
to be lived with others.

24:22.994 --> 24:26.131
It is too hard to do it alone.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.913
[grunting]

24:50.855 --> 24:51.923
[growls]

25:01.299 --> 25:02.300
Bruce!

25:02.333 --> 25:03.802
[all grunting]

25:08.339 --> 25:10.876
Fine. Let's do it the hard way.

25:14.845 --> 25:17.048
[grunting]

25:18.082 --> 25:18.950
[screams]

25:41.305 --> 25:44.676
[Jeffrey] Peace, love
and contentment, my friends.

25:46.177 --> 25:48.813
Live low and humbly
like the snake.

25:48.846 --> 25:51.583
At one with nature. Perfect.

25:51.616 --> 25:54.886
Unchanged for
a hundred-million years.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.857
Give me the numbers.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.160
Ten new offices opening
throughout the country.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.596
The penthouse you requested
in Los Angeles,

26:04.629 --> 26:08.366
and, interestingly,
we've got a new recruit.

26:08.399 --> 26:10.335
[scoffs] I hate his movies.

26:11.669 --> 26:13.805
But, still, money is money.

26:13.838 --> 26:14.973
[phone ringing]

26:16.273 --> 26:19.344
Yes? Schlangenfaust.

26:21.412 --> 26:23.781
Is the problem taken care of?

26:23.814 --> 26:24.882
[Schlangenfaust] No, sir.

26:24.915 --> 26:26.851
The Axe Gang failed.

26:26.884 --> 26:31.222
It would seem our quarry
is a bit more formidable
than we thought.

26:31.255 --> 26:33.691
[Jeffrey on phone]
Too much for you to handle?

26:33.724 --> 26:35.760
-No.
-Good.

26:35.793 --> 26:37.362
And, Schlangenfaust...

26:37.395 --> 26:41.032
make sure the Axe Gang
knows my displeasure.

26:41.065 --> 26:42.734
It's already taken care of.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.802
[straining]

26:57.848 --> 27:00.251
[hesitatingly] So, uh,
what was that back there?

27:00.284 --> 27:03.221
They've obviously been sent
to stop you from interfering.

27:03.254 --> 27:04.656
Not that.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.858
The mask. The costume?

27:08.726 --> 27:09.994
Well?

27:10.027 --> 27:12.197
It's a way
to keep my lives separate.

27:13.097 --> 27:13.965
Safe.

27:15.099 --> 27:16.668
It's more than that, Bruce.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.036
Those guys were scared shi--

27:18.069 --> 27:20.204
Let's concentrate on
the task at hand.

27:20.237 --> 27:22.841
We need to get to the sword
before anyone else does.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.810
So... we need Shiva.

27:27.778 --> 27:28.880
We need Shiva.

27:42.793 --> 27:45.730
[O-Sensei] This...
is Soul Breaker,

27:45.763 --> 27:48.966
one of two swords
made centuries ago

27:48.999 --> 27:52.403
by the master swordsmith,
Muramasa.

27:52.436 --> 27:56.007
The metal has been folded
too many times to count,

27:56.040 --> 27:59.210
making it as flexible as a reed

28:00.144 --> 28:01.813
and as strong as stone.

28:05.149 --> 28:10.221
It is said, the blade
was made with dark magic,

28:10.254 --> 28:12.290
making it more than a sword.

28:12.323 --> 28:16.094
It is a key to life and death.

28:16.127 --> 28:20.932
So, it must be guarded
by one... who chooses life.

28:24.935 --> 28:27.372
Shiva. Come forward.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.048
Because of your focus,

28:37.081 --> 28:39.217
strength, and integrity,

28:39.250 --> 28:41.285
I bestow upon you

28:41.318 --> 28:44.822
the responsibility
of safe-guarding this blade,

28:44.855 --> 28:46.157
Soul Breaker.

28:53.397 --> 28:55.032
[scoffs]

28:55.065 --> 28:58.103
Jade, is there something
you'd like to say?

29:00.871 --> 29:02.273
No, O-Sensei.

29:03.574 --> 29:06.377
Please. We are family here.

29:06.410 --> 29:07.946
There are no secrets.

29:08.846 --> 29:11.282
What troubles you?

29:11.315 --> 29:14.418
Shiva is, as you say,
a woman of integrity.

29:14.451 --> 29:16.954
But, she is soft.

29:16.987 --> 29:19.157
She lacks the killer instinct.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.425
She doesn't deserve the sword.

29:22.059 --> 29:24.829
Oh? And who does?

29:24.862 --> 29:27.064
Anyone else. Rip, maybe?

29:27.097 --> 29:29.467
He's been here longer
than any of us,
besides Richard.

29:30.334 --> 29:32.103
And you feel that tenure

29:32.136 --> 29:34.472
is more important
than my judgement?

29:38.075 --> 29:39.043
Very well.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.116
Rip Jagger, stand.

29:47.885 --> 29:51.055
Would you like to be
the caretaker of the blade?

29:51.922 --> 29:53.891
Yes, O-Sensei.

29:53.924 --> 29:56.360
Then, defeat Shiva,

29:56.393 --> 29:59.531
and the responsibility
will be yours.

30:01.298 --> 30:02.967
Yes, O-Sensei.

30:08.005 --> 30:12.210
Oh, Shiva, one more thing.

30:12.243 --> 30:15.814
You may use only
one finger in defense.

30:16.347 --> 30:17.282
Say, what?

30:18.883 --> 30:20.118
Yes, O-Sensei.

30:29.426 --> 30:30.862
Begin!

Shiva isn't
the woman you remember.

32:00.751 --> 32:02.120
She's changed.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.156
Yeah. So it would seem.

32:09.994 --> 32:13.597
[Bruce] She's the head
of organized crime
in Gotham's Chinatown.

32:13.630 --> 32:15.600
Known for
her ruthlessness and temper.

32:18.402 --> 32:22.039
You haven't put on
your Halloween mask
and tried to stop her yet?

33:09.486 --> 33:13.090
Nothing dishonorable
about winning, darlin'!

Then, you should have
no problem defeating me.

a great time
to put on that mask.

35:33.697 --> 35:34.798
What mask?

35:34.831 --> 35:36.600
Bruce has this mask.

35:36.633 --> 35:38.569
He puts it on and it's like
he's a different person.

of the monastery,

39:43.613 --> 39:45.015
why is it forbidden?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.859
You said there were
no secrets with family.

39:57.594 --> 40:01.732
It is the place
where all destinies converge.

40:01.765 --> 40:04.501
It is why I am here,

40:04.534 --> 40:08.639
and someday,
if you train hard enough,

40:08.672 --> 40:12.042
it will be
why you are here too.

40:15.712 --> 40:18.148
That doesn't make any sense.

40:18.181 --> 40:21.652
Ha! Since when did
I start making sense?

40:25.922 --> 40:27.658
Geez, Ben.

40:27.691 --> 40:30.127
Maybe try to chew your food
instead of inhaling it?

It takes a lot
to look this good.

40:34.498 --> 40:35.999
Oh, no, you didn't.

40:36.032 --> 40:38.502
There better be some rice left
in that bowl, chump,

40:38.535 --> 40:40.871
or you and I
are gonna have to talk.

40:40.904 --> 40:43.006
Sorry, I got the last of it.

40:43.039 --> 40:44.442
I'd be happy to share.

40:46.243 --> 40:48.178
[bowl clangs]

40:48.211 --> 40:50.180
I don't need
your charity, fool!

40:50.213 --> 40:52.550
What I need is for you
to know your place.

40:53.116 --> 40:54.952
And where's that?

40:54.985 --> 40:56.520
Behind me.

40:56.553 --> 40:58.856
You think we're supposed
to give you a break

40:58.889 --> 41:02.125
-because Mommy and Daddy
got killed in front of you?
-[grunts]

41:02.158 --> 41:04.795
Huh? Happens every day
in my neighborhood,

41:04.828 --> 41:06.864
only it don't make the paper.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.665
You only get what you earn.

41:08.698 --> 41:10.234
And from where I'm standing,

41:10.267 --> 41:11.936
you ain't earned
nothing, turkey.

41:13.236 --> 41:14.839
[grunts]

41:16.873 --> 41:19.009
O-Sensei, we have to stop them.

41:19.042 --> 41:20.578
No, they need this.

41:21.745 --> 41:23.881
Plus, my TV is on the fritz.

41:24.948 --> 41:26.517
Come on.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.618
Oh, you wanna go?

41:28.752 --> 41:29.853
[both grunting]

41:29.886 --> 41:30.754
[groans]

41:34.791 --> 41:36.660
[both grunting]

41:40.263 --> 41:41.165
[groans]

41:47.270 --> 41:48.806
Where do you think
you're going?

41:49.739 --> 41:51.208
All right, rich boy,

41:51.241 --> 41:54.578
I ain't ever gonna turn down
whooping somebody's ass.

41:54.611 --> 41:56.680
[both grunting]

41:59.983 --> 42:02.586
-[Bruce exhales]
-You had enough?

42:03.153 --> 42:04.188
[groans]

42:05.622 --> 42:06.957
Not even close.

42:08.058 --> 42:11.228
[both grunting]

42:17.968 --> 42:19.236
Stay down.

42:23.206 --> 42:25.609
[struggled grunts]

42:26.676 --> 42:27.545
[grunts]

42:28.211 --> 42:30.581
[panting]

42:38.622 --> 42:39.957
You're crazy, man.

42:42.659 --> 42:43.761
I can respect that.

42:47.797 --> 42:49.132
[groans]

42:49.165 --> 42:50.734
I got you.

42:50.767 --> 42:52.703
Come on, white rice,
let's get you patched up.

42:53.970 --> 42:55.039
You know what's strange?

42:56.406 --> 42:57.841
I'm kind of hungry.

42:58.642 --> 43:00.043
[chuckles]

43:00.076 --> 43:01.745
Getting your ass beat
does work up an appetite.

43:01.778 --> 43:03.113
[both chuckling]

43:03.146 --> 43:04.348
[Bruce] Ow!

43:04.381 --> 43:07.685
[train whirring]

43:12.055 --> 43:13.991
[indistinct chatter]

43:15.725 --> 43:19.363
[sobbing]

43:24.334 --> 43:27.404
-You okay?
-I can't do it.

43:27.437 --> 43:28.806
I'm not strong enough.

43:30.073 --> 43:32.009
Who says?

43:32.042 --> 43:34.945
-No one. I just--
-That's right.

43:35.879 --> 43:36.914
No one.

43:39.082 --> 43:40.651
When I was a kid,

43:40.684 --> 43:42.986
I didn't think I was
strong enough either.

43:43.019 --> 43:44.922
I thought,
if I trained hard enough,

43:45.989 --> 43:47.324
acted tough,

43:47.357 --> 43:48.959
that was gonna be all it took.

43:49.859 --> 43:52.295
But it's not.

43:52.328 --> 43:57.034
Martial arts is not about
mastering a punch, or a kick.

43:57.067 --> 43:59.069
It's about mastering
what's in here,

43:59.869 --> 44:00.938
and here.

44:02.105 --> 44:04.341
So that when things are hard,

44:04.374 --> 44:07.177
when you don't know
if you're strong enough,

44:07.210 --> 44:09.880
you can reach inside
and remember the truth.

44:10.413 --> 44:11.948
What's that?

44:11.981 --> 44:13.283
The only thing stopping you...

44:14.150 --> 44:15.118
is you.

44:15.151 --> 44:17.421
[train screeches]

44:20.090 --> 44:22.860
-I'm ready now.
-Hell yes, you are.

44:29.199 --> 44:30.868
[Richard] The student
has become the teacher.

44:35.438 --> 44:37.140
Why do I get
the distinct feeling

44:37.173 --> 44:38.409
that you're not here to enroll?

44:39.375 --> 44:41.178
They found The Gate.

44:41.211 --> 44:42.279
And they have the sword.

44:43.379 --> 44:44.248
They?

44:53.490 --> 44:54.458
Let me get my coat.

44:56.226 --> 44:58.228
[train whirring continues]

45:01.231 --> 45:02.866
[Jade] I don't know

45:02.899 --> 45:04.401
why he can't ever
just give me a straight answer?

45:04.434 --> 45:07.938
He always has to be so cryptic
and mysterious.

45:07.971 --> 45:09.873
[Richard] Come on, you should
be used to it by now.

45:10.473 --> 45:12.142
I bet

45:12.175 --> 45:15.979
he hides his most secret
techniques behind that door.

45:16.012 --> 45:17.414
[Shiva] Or riches.

45:17.447 --> 45:21.284
Ancient jewels and gold,
hoarded over time.

45:21.317 --> 45:23.386
I bet it's something powerful.

45:23.419 --> 45:25.255
Something he's too
afraid to use.

45:25.288 --> 45:26.356
[Ben] You're all wrong.

45:31.427 --> 45:33.497
It's probably a Whirlpool.

45:33.530 --> 45:36.734
A luxury spa room
to help him achieve Nirvana.

45:37.233 --> 45:38.302
Shut up.

45:39.102 --> 45:41.171
[all laugh]

45:41.204 --> 45:44.241
What about you, Bruce?
Got any ideas?

45:44.274 --> 45:45.342
Yeah, it's obvious.

45:46.209 --> 45:47.811
Really? Do tell.

45:48.978 --> 45:50.147
It's a distraction.

45:50.980 --> 45:51.849
Good night.

45:59.122 --> 46:00.524
[Ben] I'm still betting
on that Whirlpool.

46:07.864 --> 46:09.366
[distant woman screaming]

46:09.399 --> 46:10.267
What was that?

46:18.308 --> 46:19.476
[footsteps approaching]

46:20.410 --> 46:22.078
Jade and Rip are missing.

46:22.111 --> 46:23.280
So is Soul Breaker.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.916
[Jade screams]

46:25.949 --> 46:26.817
Quickly!

46:30.553 --> 46:31.822
Be on guard.

46:46.169 --> 46:47.170
Jade!

46:47.203 --> 46:48.905
What have you done?

46:48.938 --> 46:52.242
[Rip] What you have been
too afraid to do, old man.

46:52.275 --> 46:55.111
Why do you think I came here
so many years ago?

46:55.144 --> 46:56.213
For your teaching?

46:57.247 --> 46:58.982
I came for The Gate.

46:59.015 --> 47:00.450
The Gate?
What's he talking about?

47:02.352 --> 47:04.855
What O-Sensei
is too afraid to tell you,

47:04.888 --> 47:07.624
is that there is a god
on the other side of this Gate.

47:07.657 --> 47:09.426
One that will make
the world right again.

47:10.627 --> 47:12.062
He calls to me.

47:12.662 --> 47:14.231
And I...

47:14.264 --> 47:17.534
I will be the vessel
of his divine power.

47:17.567 --> 47:20.070
There is no god
on the other side, Rip.

47:20.103 --> 47:21.238
Only a demon.

47:22.038 --> 47:23.506
You have to stop.

47:23.539 --> 47:25.909
Stop before
it's too late, my son.

47:25.942 --> 47:27.644
It's already too late.

47:27.677 --> 47:30.380
The Gate requires
a sacrifice to open,

47:30.413 --> 47:31.581
a soul.

47:31.614 --> 47:33.283
And the sword...

47:33.316 --> 47:36.119
is the conduit, the key.

47:36.152 --> 47:38.455
Stop! Stop, you fool.

47:38.488 --> 47:39.923
Do not open that Gate.

47:39.956 --> 47:41.859
You're the fool, old man.

47:42.659 --> 47:45.395
Rip, listen to your master.

47:46.663 --> 47:48.298
[Rip] Oh, Richard,

47:48.331 --> 47:50.400
he was never my master.

47:52.568 --> 47:55.606
[blazing]

47:58.207 --> 47:59.243
Stand back.

47:59.943 --> 48:01.211
[rumbling]

48:05.048 --> 48:07.918
Come! Your servant
welcomes you.

48:09.285 --> 48:12.489
Yes, the heralds
of the great Naga!

48:12.522 --> 48:14.658
I am Rip Jagger,

48:14.691 --> 48:17.060
-your master's humble--
-[demon roars]

48:17.093 --> 48:18.061
No!

48:18.094 --> 48:19.996
[Rip groans]

48:20.029 --> 48:21.965
[bones cracking]

48:21.998 --> 48:23.633
[demon roars]

48:23.666 --> 48:25.435
This is what
I've trained you for.

48:26.502 --> 48:28.005
[roars]

48:29.138 --> 48:30.040

Hey, over here.

49:47.784 --> 49:50.287
[grunting]

49:55.558 --> 49:57.327
The door, it's closing.

49:57.360 --> 49:58.762
O-Sensei.

49:58.795 --> 50:00.630
[O-Sensei] It takes
a soul to open the door,

50:01.597 --> 50:04.134
and sacrifice to close it.

50:06.769 --> 50:08.338
[all grunting]

50:08.371 --> 50:10.807
No! O-Sensei,
there has to be another way.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.542
-This is my destiny...
-[Richard straining]

50:13.309 --> 50:14.411
My purpose.

50:17.580 --> 50:21.118
Remember, you are
stronger together than apart.

50:22.385 --> 50:25.755
-Never forget...
-[rumbling, slams]

50:25.788 --> 50:26.723
[demon attacks]

50:26.756 --> 50:28.425
[O-Sensei screams]

50:28.458 --> 50:29.359
No!

50:30.493 --> 50:32.195
We have to find a way back in.

50:32.228 --> 50:33.430
We have to save him.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.365
He's gone, Richard.

50:35.398 --> 50:38.134
Whatever was
on the other side, got him.

50:38.167 --> 50:41.338
[rumbling]

50:43.606 --> 50:46.209
[Ben] Come on, brother,
we have got to go. Come on.

50:46.242 --> 50:47.677
He wouldn't want you
to die with him.

51:17.773 --> 51:19.342
[insects chirping]

51:21.277 --> 51:24.448
[helicopter whirring]

51:29.785 --> 51:31.254
[Eve] The Gate is secure.

51:31.287 --> 51:32.689
And the sword?

51:32.722 --> 51:34.124
It's en route as we speak.

51:34.724 --> 51:35.625
Excellent.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.395
Double the security
around the island.

51:39.428 --> 51:42.532
Nothing can interrupt
the ceremony once it's begun.

51:42.565 --> 51:45.535
[whirring]

51:48.304 --> 51:52.309
-[hydraulic whirring]
-[thuds]

51:59.749 --> 52:02.352
Aww, don't be sacred, children.

52:03.619 --> 52:04.688
Not yet.

52:08.524 --> 52:12.129
[airplane engine whirring]

52:20.903 --> 52:21.771
[beep]

52:28.411 --> 52:31.681
[Richard]
Here, aerial photography
of the island.

52:31.714 --> 52:34.851
There's anti-aircraft
artillery all over the place.

52:34.884 --> 52:37.687
Here, here and here.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.856
The place is crawling
with soldiers.

52:39.889 --> 52:41.791
This isn't gonna be easy.

52:41.824 --> 52:43.593
I say we land in the middle
and kill them all.

52:45.661 --> 52:46.896
We're good.

52:46.929 --> 52:48.798
But even O-Sensei
couldn't dodge a bullet.

52:48.831 --> 52:50.533
You sure about that?

52:50.566 --> 52:51.734
[Ben] The tunnels...

52:51.767 --> 52:53.436
Dig this.

52:53.469 --> 52:55.371
There is a series of catacombs
beneath the island

52:55.404 --> 52:57.340
that lead to
the center courtyard.

52:57.373 --> 52:58.741
But getting to it,

52:58.774 --> 52:59.842
I don't know.

52:59.875 --> 53:01.711
What?

53:01.744 --> 53:04.480
There is a vertical cave
that drops a few hundred
feet down.

53:04.513 --> 53:06.349
So, we free-fall in,

53:06.382 --> 53:07.850
open our chutes
and we're in business.

53:07.883 --> 53:10.587
The entrance in 10 feet wide.

53:11.754 --> 53:12.622
Oh.

53:13.623 --> 53:15.258
Then we don't miss.

53:15.291 --> 53:16.559
How is it that you know

53:16.592 --> 53:17.694
so much about
this island, Benjamin?

53:18.928 --> 53:20.430
I've been here before.

53:21.664 --> 53:23.633
In fact...

53:23.666 --> 53:25.302
it's my fault
we're in this mess.

53:29.939 --> 53:32.675
[Ben] After what happened
to O-Sensei,

53:32.708 --> 53:34.377
I needed to work
some stuff out.

53:38.781 --> 53:39.782
[Ben grunting]

53:39.815 --> 53:40.684
[man groans]

53:41.817 --> 53:43.653
-[grunting]
-[groaning]

53:45.521 --> 53:46.623
Aah!

53:56.399 --> 53:59.002
[Ben] I came across
a cobra symbol.

53:59.035 --> 54:00.637
It was identical to Rip's.

54:03.739 --> 54:06.542
That's when I learned
about the Kobra Cult,

54:06.575 --> 54:10.647
a worldwide organization
of murderous zealots.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.716
They had temples
all over the globe.

54:13.983 --> 54:15.285
Deeper I dug,

54:16.319 --> 54:17.354
the more I found.

54:20.890 --> 54:23.260
And I meant to stop
every damn one of 'em.

54:29.965 --> 54:32.936
Each one led me
to someone higher up
in the food chain.

54:33.969 --> 54:36.572
[grunting]

54:36.605 --> 54:38.908
I smashed their
operations all over the world.

54:39.642 --> 54:41.678
[grunting]

54:41.711 --> 54:44.714
In fact, Kobra started
getting a little scared of me.

54:44.747 --> 54:46.783
[grunting]

54:46.816 --> 54:48.618
I'd become
a sort of Boogeyman.

54:58.060 --> 55:00.763
I read a file about some one
hassling those Kobras.

55:00.796 --> 55:01.964
What did they call you?

55:01.997 --> 55:03.400
Black Samurai?

55:04.100 --> 55:05.468
Naw, man.

55:05.501 --> 55:07.603
I was the "Bronze Tiger."

55:07.636 --> 55:08.538
-Ah.
-Nice.

55:08.571 --> 55:09.572
I like it.

55:10.539 --> 55:12.075
[Ben] Turns out,

55:12.108 --> 55:13.943
these cats believe
in some obscure prophesy.

55:15.678 --> 55:17.080
Some chosen one.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.049
A messiah of such power

55:20.082 --> 55:24.120
that he can became the avatar
of their great snake god.

55:24.153 --> 55:26.823
A dude names Jeffrey Burr.

55:26.856 --> 55:28.991

-[Ben grunting]
-[swords clashing]

55:38.667 --> 55:39.803
[thuds]

55:47.676 --> 55:49.479
[Ben] All I had to do
was kill him.

55:54.617 --> 55:55.752
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

55:59.555 --> 56:00.523
[shuddering]

56:00.556 --> 56:01.658
[Ben] He was just a kid.

56:03.659 --> 56:04.761
I just couldn't do it.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.402
I left. Came home.

56:13.002 --> 56:14.104
Started to teach.

56:15.805 --> 56:19.008
Help these kids
like O-Sensei helped me.

56:19.041 --> 56:21.110
I forgot all about Kobra.

56:21.143 --> 56:22.445
You did the right thing.

56:22.478 --> 56:24.080
-[Shiva] Did he?
-Shiva.

56:24.113 --> 56:25.915
If he had slit that
little bastard's throat,

56:25.948 --> 56:27.116
none of us would be here.

56:27.149 --> 56:28.618
He was an innocent.

56:28.651 --> 56:30.420
So was Hitler,
once upon a time.

56:30.453 --> 56:31.754
But give me a time machine,

56:31.787 --> 56:33.456
and I'd toss his bassinet
into a volcano.

56:33.489 --> 56:34.524
Enough.

56:34.557 --> 56:36.192
What's done is done.

56:36.225 --> 56:37.594
Let's focus on the mission.

56:38.694 --> 56:40.463
We're near the drop zone.

56:40.496 --> 56:42.031
Time to get ready.

56:42.064 --> 56:44.467
And lucky for you,
I brought supplies.

56:45.768 --> 56:46.770
[Ben] Tight.

56:49.004 --> 56:52.542
Listen, we need every advantage
we can get out there.

56:52.575 --> 56:54.778
So you damn well better be
wearing that outfit of yours.

56:58.848 --> 57:00.950
[door whirrs]

57:05.855 --> 57:08.091
[whooshing]

57:36.785 --> 57:39.456
[all grunting]

57:43.759 --> 57:45.595
The opening's about
a half a klick that way.

57:46.095 --> 57:46.963
Let's go.

57:54.870 --> 57:57.941
[hurried footsteps]

58:01.176 --> 58:04.747
[footsteps approaching]

58:12.821 --> 58:13.923
[Schlangenfaust] No use hiding.

58:14.790 --> 58:15.892
I know you're there.

58:16.992 --> 58:17.994
Please come out.

58:25.834 --> 58:27.236
Move!

58:27.269 --> 58:29.272
Unless you want me to add
your bones to the others.

58:31.640 --> 58:33.609
Such spirit.

58:33.642 --> 58:35.144
I will take great pleasure

58:35.177 --> 58:37.046
-in watching you die
by my hands.
-[hissing]

58:38.747 --> 58:40.583

58:40.616 --> 58:41.985
What the funky hell?

58:42.818 --> 58:44.120
Please.

58:44.153 --> 58:45.655
Do come closer.

58:48.624 --> 58:49.726

[both grunting]

58:55.030 --> 58:56.566
[groaning]

59:00.869 --> 59:02.739
You really shouldn't
have done that.

59:04.173 --> 59:06.709
-His hand.
-I can see that, Richard.

59:06.742 --> 59:07.844
No, the other one.

59:13.649 --> 59:15.084
[roaring]

59:15.851 --> 59:17.820
So... No blades.

59:20.022 --> 59:21.791

59:56.225 --> 59:59.829
Richard, Shiva,
[grunts] get topside.

59:59.862 --> 1:00:01.130
Ben and I will take care
of these two.

1:00:08.170 --> 1:00:09.205
The sword.

1:00:16.145 --> 1:00:17.947
At last.

1:00:17.980 --> 1:00:19.715
The time has come

1:00:19.748 --> 1:00:23.085
for the great Naga
to walk this Earth.

1:00:23.118 --> 1:00:26.255
No borders, no countries,

1:00:26.288 --> 1:00:29.025
no politicians trying
to hold us down.

1:00:29.958 --> 1:00:31.060
One king.

1:00:31.927 --> 1:00:33.196
One ruler.

1:00:33.962 --> 1:00:35.632
One god.

1:00:42.004 --> 1:00:44.440
[Jeffrey] Take solace,
my children.

1:00:44.473 --> 1:00:47.644
Your sacrifice
will not be in vain.

1:00:48.243 --> 1:00:50.279

1:00:50.312 --> 1:00:51.714
[strangled cry]

1:00:58.454 --> 1:01:00.223
I want my sword back.

Kill them!

1:02:01.350 --> 1:02:03.853
Sir Edmund Dorrance.

1:02:03.886 --> 1:02:07.090
But you may call me...
King Snake.

1:02:09.391 --> 1:02:10.860
I think I'll call you
"dead meat."

1:02:11.393 --> 1:02:14.464
[grunting]

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:18.735

I might have something
that could help.

1:03:15.858 --> 1:03:17.059
Mace? Against them?

1:03:17.092 --> 1:03:18.094
Worth a try.

You're wrong.

That's what
they had you believe.

You were a child

They told you,
you were special.

1:07:23.105 --> 1:07:24.040
No!

1:09:36.805 --> 1:09:39.441
who thought
he could defeat evil.

1:09:39.474 --> 1:09:40.776
And Richard...

1:09:41.810 --> 1:09:43.579
Oh, Richard.

1:09:43.612 --> 1:09:46.248
The plans he had for you.

1:09:46.281 --> 1:09:47.382
[Batman] Who are you?

1:09:47.415 --> 1:09:49.851
The one which was foretold.

1:09:49.884 --> 1:09:51.820
The great Naga.

1:09:51.853 --> 1:09:53.889
The harbinger of destruction.

1:09:54.623 --> 1:09:56.325
Listen...

1:09:56.358 --> 1:09:58.894
Even now my hordes are
making their way to The Gate

1:09:58.927 --> 1:10:02.965
ready to lay waste
to your soft world.

1:10:04.032 --> 1:10:05.601
Release our master.

1:10:06.368 --> 1:10:09.705
[laughs]

1:10:09.738 --> 1:10:12.007
There is no release.

1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:13.775
There is only death!

1:10:13.808 --> 1:10:15.978
[all grunting]

1:10:17.846 --> 1:10:19.615
[groans]

1:10:19.648 --> 1:10:24.753
It is time to bring your world
to its knees before me.

1:10:24.786 --> 1:10:25.854
[grunts]

1:10:31.893 --> 1:10:34.296
[evil laughter]

1:10:34.329 --> 1:10:36.698
Good... Good.

1:10:36.731 --> 1:10:38.934
Your master
has taught you well.

1:10:40.068 --> 1:10:42.004
But it won't be enough.

1:10:42.837 --> 1:10:43.939
[groans]

1:10:44.773 --> 1:10:46.742
[struggling]

1:10:53.515 --> 1:10:54.683
[Shiva grunting]

1:10:54.716 --> 1:10:55.751
[Ben grunting]

1:11:02.957 --> 1:11:03.826
[groans]

1:11:05.427 --> 1:11:06.328
Argh!

1:11:07.429 --> 1:11:08.497
[footsteps approaching]

1:11:08.530 --> 1:11:10.766
[grunting]

1:11:14.336 --> 1:11:16.605
[groans in pain]

1:11:18.039 --> 1:11:19.008
[Batarang whizzing]

1:11:26.348 --> 1:11:27.716
Hmph!

1:11:27.749 --> 1:11:29.017
-Bruce.
-[Shiva groans]

1:11:29.050 --> 1:11:30.485
O-Sensei has shown me

1:11:30.518 --> 1:11:33.055
you are the least skilled
of them all,

1:11:33.088 --> 1:11:35.691
though he admires
your determination. [chuckles]

1:11:35.724 --> 1:11:37.959
Your private battle
to save Gotham.

1:11:37.992 --> 1:11:41.463
Uh, but... the truth is,

1:11:41.496 --> 1:11:43.799
you are just a sad little boy

1:11:43.832 --> 1:11:47.069
trying to quiet
the ghosts of the past.

1:11:47.102 --> 1:11:49.772
You should have heeded
your master's words.

1:11:50.872 --> 1:11:52.808
Evil is eternal.

1:11:54.576 --> 1:11:56.978
I'm coming for your world.

1:11:57.011 --> 1:11:59.815
And you are powerless
to stop me.

1:12:03.051 --> 1:12:04.520
-[beeping]
-[explosion]

1:12:08.156 --> 1:12:09.658
What are you
going to do, Bruce?

1:12:10.625 --> 1:12:11.593
[Batarang whizzing]

1:12:12.127 --> 1:12:13.462
[slashing]

1:12:13.495 --> 1:12:14.863
-[beeping]
-[explosion]

1:12:17.565 --> 1:12:19.902
What do you have
that your comrades don't?

1:12:20.735 --> 1:12:21.704
[Batman] A cape.

1:12:23.571 --> 1:12:24.539
[muffling]

1:12:24.572 --> 1:12:26.975
[struggled muffles]

1:12:27.008 --> 1:12:27.876
[bone cracks]

1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:46.962
[bone cracks]

1:12:46.995 --> 1:12:49.465
As I said... sad.

1:12:50.799 --> 1:12:51.700
[grunts]

1:12:53.468 --> 1:12:54.403
[groans]

1:13:00.508 --> 1:13:01.844
[groaning]

1:13:03.077 --> 1:13:06.581
You don't deserve
to look like him.

1:13:06.614 --> 1:13:08.150
-Don't worry.
-[choking]

1:13:08.183 --> 1:13:10.719
This form is just temporary.

1:13:10.752 --> 1:13:15.157
I can only exist in your world
with a proper shell.

1:13:15.190 --> 1:13:18.193
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1:13:18.226 --> 1:13:21.797
That to stay in this world,
I need an avatar.

1:13:22.797 --> 1:13:24.966
[groans, gasps]

1:13:24.999 --> 1:13:28.837
Someone strong enough
to hold my spirit.

1:13:30.705 --> 1:13:33.141
Your O-Sensei was a clever one.

1:13:33.174 --> 1:13:36.812
Hiding him in plain sight.

1:13:36.845 --> 1:13:39.981
A young boy,
trained in the ways of war.

1:13:40.014 --> 1:13:44.052
His true destiny
hidden from him.

1:13:44.085 --> 1:13:46.555
The one who can
hold the great serpent.

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:48.490
The one they call... Dragon.

1:13:50.892 --> 1:13:52.795
And here you are...

1:13:53.761 --> 1:13:54.930
right in front of me.

1:13:56.764 --> 1:13:58.800
It is your destiny.

1:13:58.833 --> 1:14:02.170
I can give you power
beyond your imagining.

1:14:02.203 --> 1:14:04.072
Purpose.

1:14:04.105 --> 1:14:06.708
Isn't that what
you always desired?

1:14:10.044 --> 1:14:11.113
[Richard] No.

1:14:13.781 --> 1:14:16.618
You have such power
in you, Richard.

1:14:16.651 --> 1:14:19.955
[groaning]

1:14:19.988 --> 1:14:21.790
O-Sensei knew it.

1:14:21.823 --> 1:14:24.826
You are the only one strong
enough to contain my spirit.

1:14:24.859 --> 1:14:26.528
[groaning]

1:14:26.561 --> 1:14:28.129
[panting, exhales]

1:14:28.162 --> 1:14:29.965
[pants]

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:34.236
If I'm the only one
strong enough to hold you,

1:14:36.204 --> 1:14:38.774
then I'm the only one
strong enough to defeat you.

1:14:48.283 --> 1:14:49.585
[grunting]

1:14:52.086 --> 1:14:54.790
Heh! You cannot defeat me.

1:14:56.724 --> 1:14:59.094
Yeah, I think I can.

1:15:03.031 --> 1:15:04.633
This is my destiny.

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:06.668
To be the best fighter
there is.

1:15:06.701 --> 1:15:08.036
And no one...

1:15:08.069 --> 1:15:10.539
Not even some
second-rate demon god

1:15:10.572 --> 1:15:12.040
is going to stop that.

1:15:13.074 --> 1:15:14.510
[grunting]

1:15:18.179 --> 1:15:19.748
[straining]

1:15:27.322 --> 1:15:29.191
[growling]

1:15:31.326 --> 1:15:32.294
[groans]

1:15:41.069 --> 1:15:42.304
[straining]

1:15:42.337 --> 1:15:44.306
I had hoped
you would come willingly.

1:15:44.339 --> 1:15:46.642
[straining]

1:15:50.044 --> 1:15:52.881
But no matter,
I will take you by force.

1:15:57.352 --> 1:15:58.687
[whizzes, beeps]

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.222
[explosion]

1:16:04.058 --> 1:16:04.927
Richard!

1:16:05.727 --> 1:16:06.662
[grunts]

1:16:13.768 --> 1:16:15.870
[O-Sensei] You can't
destroy me, Richard.

1:16:15.903 --> 1:16:18.607
I am forever.

1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.609
-My soul will live on...
-[straining]

1:16:20.642 --> 1:16:22.644
For eternity.

1:16:23.711 --> 1:16:26.014
Soul, did you say?

1:16:32.754 --> 1:16:33.722
No.

1:16:41.262 --> 1:16:42.197
[rumbles]

1:16:46.134 --> 1:16:48.303
[pained growl]

1:16:54.075 --> 1:16:56.945
[pained shriek]

1:17:07.021 --> 1:17:09.257
[groans]

1:17:18.166 --> 1:17:19.101
[groans]

1:17:26.407 --> 1:17:27.409
Richard...

1:17:28.776 --> 1:17:30.012
You are more than I...

1:17:31.312 --> 1:17:32.914
I could ever hope for.

1:17:36.317 --> 1:17:37.952
Thank you, my son.

1:17:37.985 --> 1:17:39.221
[footsteps approaching]

1:17:42.457 --> 1:17:44.759
And Bruce...

1:17:44.792 --> 1:17:47.796
your parents would be proud.

1:17:47.829 --> 1:17:48.863
[hurried footsteps]

1:17:48.896 --> 1:17:49.898
[Shiva] O-Sensei.

1:18:21.963 --> 1:18:22.998
Then it's over.

1:18:24.365 --> 1:18:25.366
No.

1:18:25.399 --> 1:18:26.702
We have to close The Gate.

1:18:27.535 --> 1:18:29.738
Yeah. About that.

1:18:29.771 --> 1:18:32.774
It needs a sacrifice to close,
and well...

1:18:32.807 --> 1:18:34.242
I have a lot to atone for.

1:18:34.275 --> 1:18:36.177
No, I should go.

1:18:36.210 --> 1:18:38.179
O-Sensei left me the sword.

1:18:38.212 --> 1:18:40.482
It is the honorable thing
to do.

1:18:40.515 --> 1:18:43.251
You're both wrong.
This is my burden to bare.

1:18:44.852 --> 1:18:45.887
Where's white rice?

1:19:06.073 --> 1:19:07.308
You think I'm gonna

1:19:07.341 --> 1:19:09.177
let your jive ass
take all the glory?

1:19:09.210 --> 1:19:10.412
-Get out before they--
-[portal door rumbling]

1:19:18.019 --> 1:19:20.088
[slams]

1:19:20.121 --> 1:19:21.456
-You shouldn't have--
-Please.

1:19:21.489 --> 1:19:23.158
I've had enough
of men telling me

1:19:23.191 --> 1:19:24.359
what I should and shouldn't do.

1:19:25.393 --> 1:19:27.162
We're in this together, Bruce.

1:19:27.195 --> 1:19:29.230
Just like we've always been.

1:19:29.263 --> 1:19:30.432
Like we're supposed to be.

1:19:31.966 --> 1:19:34.169
We are "the Dragon."

1:19:35.369 --> 1:19:36.271
[Ben sniffles]

1:19:38.105 --> 1:19:40.441
Are you crying?

1:19:40.474 --> 1:19:42.443
-No.
-[sniffles]

1:19:42.476 --> 1:19:45.847
[demons roaring]

1:19:54.355 --> 1:19:55.323
All right then.

1:19:57.258 --> 1:19:58.324
Let's get it on.
