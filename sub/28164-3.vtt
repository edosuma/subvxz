WEBVTT

00:45.128 --> 00:47.047
Wake up. Wake up.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.177
[groans]

01:03.438 --> 01:04.355
Where am I?

01:05.899 --> 01:06.858
Why am I naked?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.069
Where are my clothes?

01:09.569 --> 01:10.487
Oh.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.949
They got ruined
when you ripped out of them.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.035
You'll get used to it.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.995
Used to what?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.664
Who are you people?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.875
Dude, it's me, Randall.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.210
I'm your RA.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.253
I know that! I meant them!

01:28.379 --> 01:31.508
Oh, this is Hamish and Lilith.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.802
And together, we are...

01:34.260 --> 01:36.179
the Knights of Saint Christopher!

01:36.262 --> 01:38.306
Guys, I thought we were gonna say that
together.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.849
And that's what?

01:41.601 --> 01:42.519
<i>Improv troupe?</i>

01:42.602 --> 01:46.564
-We are a sacred brotherhood.
-A gender neutral collective.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.193
Anointed to fight dark magic
with the power--

01:50.276 --> 01:52.320
Dude! We're werewolves!

01:52.779 --> 01:55.198
And now, so are you.

02:02.038 --> 02:02.997
Oh.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.333
-[laughs]
-[laughs]

02:05.416 --> 02:08.294
Yeah, I get it.
Townie wanted to join a secret society,

02:08.378 --> 02:10.004
so let's make him think they--

02:10.922 --> 02:12.257
[vomits]

02:15.677 --> 02:18.888
Yeah, you ate a deer last night.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.100
This isn't happening.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.437
-This is not happening.
-Oh, it's happening.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.816
The spirit of Silverback
chose you as his champion.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.734
He bound to you, and you transformed.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.570
Transformed into what?

02:34.070 --> 02:34.946
A werewolf.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.281
Dude...

02:37.240 --> 02:39.409
try to keep up.
I told them you were smart.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.620
Silverback's been dormant for 50 years
and he picks this dumb-ass?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.247
[Randall] Jack's the real deal.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.333
Every time I got close to that golem,
he was there.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.836
You saw me fight Clay
and you didn't help me?

02:49.919 --> 02:51.671
You were that thing in the graveyard.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.007
-You almost killed me.
-Welcome to the club!

02:54.090 --> 02:54.924
No!

02:55.592 --> 02:58.094
I am not going to be a werewolf.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.638
Too late. You already are.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.308
Look, no,
it wasn't a full moon last night.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.309
Not a thing.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.604
-What about silver bullets?
-Ah, duh. Because it's a bullet.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.356
Take it back. Un-werewolf me.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.651
Once you're selected,
you're a champion until the day you die.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.946
So, just say the oath and get on with it.
I have class in an hour.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.489
What oath?

03:18.573 --> 03:21.201
"I give my life to the cause."

03:23.494 --> 03:25.830
Fuck this and fuck you.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.334
Hey!

03:29.792 --> 03:32.045
-That was my robe!
-He'll come around.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.213
And if he doesn't?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.131
We kill him.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.564
[sharp ringing noise]

03:53.191 --> 03:54.943
[groans]

03:55.109 --> 03:59.572
-[sharp whisting noise]
-[groans]

04:07.789 --> 04:09.958
[man's voice] The Respondeo Incantation.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.336
Interesting choice.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.090
Given the number of people affected,

04:17.173 --> 04:20.301
I thought it made the most sense.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.887
Unless, of course,
you preferred something else?

04:22.971 --> 04:25.765
No, no, it's some solid incantation.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.767
Reliable.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.728
I'll admit,
creating a large-scale memory shift

04:30.812 --> 04:32.814
isn't as straightforward as it used to be.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.732
Well, that's where Twitter comes in.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.152
I love your new profile picture,
by the way.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.573
Will you be returning to Manhattan soon?

04:43.199 --> 04:45.576
I have some business
that'll keep me in town for a while.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.121
I may need to borrow your temple.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.081
I'll give it back, I promise.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.332
[laughs]

04:51.416 --> 04:54.502
It is at your disposal, as am I.

04:54.585 --> 04:58.172
In that case,
maybe we should throw a little soirée.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.508
I'd love to meet the up-and-comers.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.636
Maybe I can help
put this whole golem thing behind us.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.556
I'll put something together.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.142
Will there be anything else?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.853
That kid that killed the golem...

05:13.229 --> 05:14.981
he failed the selection process.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.482
He did.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.484
Why did he still have his memory?

05:19.610 --> 05:23.281
The Medicum claims she made a mistake
with the powder.

05:25.033 --> 05:25.867
Do you believe her?

05:28.578 --> 05:32.165
Alyssa Drake is one of our brightest.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.293
She's way too smart
to drop the ball like that.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.962
Make sure she's at the party.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.927
[door closes]

05:54.937 --> 05:55.897
Are you seeing this?

06:14.582 --> 06:15.958
It wasn't a bike accident.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.698
Holy shit.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.207
Holy shit.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.462
[woman's voice] Better get used to it.
Magic can get pretty sticky.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.090
What happened here?

07:05.883 --> 07:09.554
[woman's voice]
This looks like a respondeo incantation.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.350
This is nothing.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.145
I had to scrub goat intestines
from the ceiling

07:17.228 --> 07:19.230
the first time I cleaned up in here.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.648
We have to clean this?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.400
No.

07:22.733 --> 07:23.901
"We" don't.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.323
Welcome to The Order, Acolyte.
Cleaning supplies are in the closet.

07:31.742 --> 07:32.952
Amir's shrine,

07:34.120 --> 07:37.248
it changed because
of  this Respondeo Incantation, didn't it?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.918
Maybe tutoring you
won't be so bad after all.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.921
-A tutor?
-Every Acolyte gets one.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.048
You got stuck with me for some reason.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.092
Just lucky, I guess.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.262
Freshmen don't get lucky with me.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.433
And make sure you're thorough.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.768
One speck of blood
could ruin the next incantation.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.271
I have an Ethics class,
but I can be back around one--

08:00.354 --> 08:01.689
Now, Acolyte.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.539
Whoa!

08:18.623 --> 08:20.041
-Watch it.
-Sorry, Professor.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.709
It's all good, Mary Anne.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.587
You've never heard of <i>Gilligan's Island?</i>

08:24.879 --> 08:26.797
I weep for your generation.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.591
Just give me your essay.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.136
Right. The essay
that I was supposed to hand in today.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.640
-Which obviously isn't finished.
-Any chance I could get an extension?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.267
Apologies to favors in less
than a minute. That's impressive.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.437
I'm almost done, it's just that
my roommate has gone missing.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.315
-Did he say missing roommate?
-Shit. Yes.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.652
-He did!
-[lady] Missing roommate.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.612
-Missing roommate.
-I've got...

08:49.862 --> 08:50.947
dead roommate.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.991
Well, that doesn't count. If you can see
the corpse, it's not missing.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.161
Ah! Missing roommate! Bingo!

08:57.662 --> 08:59.413
You owe me $20. Pay up, sucker.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.581
I'll catch you later.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.417
You play bingo with our excuses?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.711
Isn't that a little unethical?

09:05.795 --> 09:09.131
I have a PhD and you're a freshman. But,
no, go ahead, school me on the ethics.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.093
Unethical would be me telling you
that my next pop quiz

09:12.176 --> 09:14.762
is going to be on manipulative themes
in Macbeth.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.141
-Is it?
-I don't know. Is it?

09:20.309 --> 09:23.229
Careful, Jack. I know that smile.
Pure evil.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.899
Shall we retire to the ATM
in the cafeteria?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.025
Yes.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.654
What about my extension?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.657
Yeah, sure.
Anybody desperate enough to use

09:34.740 --> 09:36.784
"the missing roommate" excuse
must need a break.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.369
You're such a push-over.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.038
Hey, just remember this next time
you're trolling Rate-My-Prof.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.286
-[female voice] Oh, over here.
-[female voice] Excuse me. Thank you.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.879
[glass chinks]

10:30.796 --> 10:32.798
Dude. This is bullshit.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.677
-You've never bussed tables before?
-Do we look like people who buss tables?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.054
Do I look like you?

10:38.137 --> 10:41.265
If it makes you feel any better, I had
to scrub the entire temple, top to bottom.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.433
[girl] Yes, it does.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.437
Brandon, hey, I've got another couple
of loads for you. And if you don't mind,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.606
use a little fabric softener this time.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.943
Kyle is making me do his laundry.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.655
Does he make you bring him tacos at 2a.m.?

10:55.946 --> 10:59.283
Then answers the door in full Weinstein
mode? 'Cause that's what Jonas does.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.826
[Brandon] What a dick.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.579
Jonas is an insult to dicks.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.998
So, who'd you get stuck with?

11:07.625 --> 11:08.459
Alyssa.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.088
Oh, that's fair.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.048
-Want to trade?
-Not a chance.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.051
We're supposed to be learning magic,
not bartending.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.594
Maybe they're teaching us patience.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.931
I am very patient,
just ask my roommate, who's still alive,

11:22.014 --> 11:24.100
even though she insists on invading
my personal space.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.603
-Of course you'd go straight to murder.
-It's not murder, it's feminism.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.730
Look, I know it sucks, but...

11:30.231 --> 11:32.525
if we just work hard
and keep our head down and--

11:32.608 --> 11:33.734
Don't fuck up.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.196
[glass chinks]

11:37.738 --> 11:39.156
Oh boy. Here we go.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.994
[Vera] Tonight, we have
a very special guest in our presence.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.249
An alumni,
former Temple Magus of this chapter,

11:48.332 --> 11:50.209
and our current Grand Magus.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.962
Our very own, Edward Coventry.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.631
-[applause]
-Thank you.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.427
[applause]

12:01.345 --> 12:03.222
I told Vera, no speeches.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.348
[laughs]

12:05.182 --> 12:06.684
Magic. [sighs]

12:06.892 --> 12:07.852
Can you believe it?

12:08.853 --> 12:10.896
Sometimes, I can't.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.525
You know...

12:15.568 --> 12:19.280
I'm so jealous of our new recruits.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.531
You're about

12:21.323 --> 12:24.577
to start the biggest adventure
of your lives.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.000
Part of me wishes
that I could be there with you

12:31.083 --> 12:33.377
when your first simple spell is a success.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.463
[restrained chuckles]

12:35.963 --> 12:37.089
<i>Incendetur.</i>

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
[clicks fingers]

12:38.090 --> 12:43.596
[faint ringing starts]

12:43.679 --> 12:44.764
Then there's that moment...

12:44.847 --> 12:46.515
[ringing gets louder]

12:46.599 --> 12:47.933
when you realize

12:48.017 --> 12:49.101
[straining sound]

12:49.185 --> 12:51.061
that with practice...

12:52.438 --> 12:53.564
dedication...

12:53.647 --> 12:55.816
[straining sound]

12:55.941 --> 12:56.984
[Edward] commitment...

12:57.067 --> 13:00.488
[faint ringing]

13:00.613 --> 13:01.906
[sound of flames]

13:07.161 --> 13:09.038
<i>Fiats aurum.</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:13.042
ringing increases

13:13.876 --> 13:15.085
...anything is possible.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.837
[gasps]

13:16.962 --> 13:23.010
[applause]

13:23.093 --> 13:26.514
[applause]

13:26.597 --> 13:28.140
There's one every year.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.226
[laughter]

13:36.649 --> 13:37.691
[door bangs]

13:37.900 --> 13:39.235
[man's voice] I know that look.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.113
Life's pretty hectic
until you learn to control the wolf.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.366
Hectic is not the word I would use.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.743
How the hell did you get in here anyway?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.078
Poof! Magic.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.497
I would have heard that damn ringing.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.833
You've already made that connection?
Sweet.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.961
I thought I was having a stroke
the first time it happened.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.171
Why the hell does it keep trying
to make me change?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.550
It's not the ringing,
it's Silverback driving the change.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.969
He hears that sound, he'll try to get out.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.470
I need him to stop trying so hard.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.473
'Cause I almost transformed
during an incantation tonight.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.935
Dude! You got into The Order?
Why didn't you tell me?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.979
Because it's a secret society.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.273
This is great! Now we can't kill you!

14:17.565 --> 14:20.943
-Why would you want to kill me?
-No, I'm saying I don't want to kill you.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
If you're a double agent,
maybe Hamish and Lilith won't either.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.114
Why do they want to kill me?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.284
-Because you won't say the oath.
-That seems extreme.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.911
Werewolves. This is awesome.
You'll be our guy on the inside.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.037
Randall, hey.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.706
You can't tell them.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.417
It's either that,
or Lilith rips your heart out.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.960
I'm trying to save your life.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.338
And I'm trying to come to terms with this.
I need some time.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.090
And my heart.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.218
I'll do what I can.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.804
But they won't wait forever.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.726
[door bangs]

14:53.809 --> 14:54.810
[sighs]

14:58.230 --> 15:00.190
[man's voice] Lead into gold? Big deal.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.192
You know, I can totally do that.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.570
-Sure, you could.
-What?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.364
It's a simple transformation spell.
That's it.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.825
Okay. Switch it back to lead.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.125
You know, I would,
but I've been drinking, so...

15:21.003 --> 15:22.880
Do you think we'll ever be that powerful?

15:23.422 --> 15:24.340
[Vera] Oh, yes.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.677
With a little luck, a lot of hard work,
anything is possible.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.181
Miss Drake, the Grand Magus
would like to have a word with you.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.557
Me?

15:33.641 --> 15:34.475
Mm-hm.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.768
Did he say why?

15:38.354 --> 15:39.313
You just deal with that.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.733
[laughing]

15:43.984 --> 15:45.152
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.656
-Oh, that's good.
-Yum-num-num.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.495
Am I in trouble?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.164
What makes you say that?

15:57.915 --> 16:00.876
Just because I don't know why I'm here.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.463
Well, then... maybe you're in trouble.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.507
[man's voice] Vera...

16:07.299 --> 16:08.592
stop tormenting her.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.886
Alyssa Drake.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.223
It's a pleasure.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.936
Your hand.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.355
-It's healed.
-I know.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.815
Cool, right?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.317
I've heard so much about you.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.652
All good, I hope.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.779
Let's say I'm intrigued.

16:29.405 --> 16:33.367
Meet me in the temple tomorrow afternoon.
I have an interesting assignment for you.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.621
I'd be honored.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.832
Edward, please.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.502
You may go now, Miss Drake.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.590
[door opens]

16:49.675 --> 16:51.593
She is only a Medicum

16:52.094 --> 16:53.721
and a sophomore.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.348
You know there's an empty seat
on the Gnostic Council.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.685
Yes, Margaret left quite a void.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.687
And quite a mess.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.188
I think you should take it.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.566
We could do great things together.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.029
I'm not sure that I'm the best choice.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.947
Which makes you the perfect choice.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.743
You always put The Order
before your own needs.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.413
-I'll think about it.
-That's all I ask.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.459
[door opens]

17:25.169 --> 17:26.295
[door closes]

17:30.841 --> 17:31.884
[door bangs]

17:34.470 --> 17:36.597
What is a Medicum doing here?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.975
[Edward] Okay!

17:40.434 --> 17:44.229
Vera says that you're the ones
with the most potential.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.774
Potential

17:47.274 --> 17:48.817
will get you into the door,

17:49.026 --> 17:51.153
but it will not guarantee you a seat

17:51.820 --> 17:52.654
at the table.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.824
This obsidian block

17:56.200 --> 18:00.120
is estimated to be
between 1,500 and 2,000 years old.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.539
But spoiler alert.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.750
This is no ordinary...

18:05.250 --> 18:06.085
[pings]

18:06.168 --> 18:07.086
hunk of rock.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.005
[muted breathing]

18:15.219 --> 18:16.178
[bursts]

18:17.387 --> 18:21.475
[Edward] Something is inside this obsidian
that people don't want others to have.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.853
I want you to reverse engineer

18:25.854 --> 18:27.648
the magic protecting this stone.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.985
DELEATUR?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.239
Magus?

18:37.783 --> 18:38.784
With your permission?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.421
<i>Deleatur!</i>

18:51.505 --> 18:52.464
[booms]

18:52.589 --> 18:54.091
[sounds rise up]

18:54.341 --> 18:56.343
Ah! Ow. Ow.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.096
[gasps]

19:00.264 --> 19:01.557
You know how to heal that?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.644
Right. My driver
will take you to the hospital.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.566
Now you know what you're dealing with,
impress me.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.483
Alyssa.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.944
Make sure the temple
gets a proper cleansing.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.612
At once, Magus.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.907
-Now we know why she's here.
-[laughs]

19:24.746 --> 19:25.873
[door bangs]

19:31.211 --> 19:34.006
Ladies and gentlemen,
the late Jack Morton.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.550
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.343
I needed to get some studying in.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.512
Okay.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.639
What you got on Coventry?

19:43.265 --> 19:47.436
Ritual murders? Infant cannibalism?
Please say it's infant cannibalism.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.979
Well, he drinks Mezcal neat

19:49.062 --> 19:51.481
and talks like he's launching
a new smart phone.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.109
Wha-- That's it?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.528
Pops, I am a nothing burger.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.573
Layers and layers of people above me.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.618
I killed a golem
and I all I got was an "attaboy."

20:02.701 --> 20:05.162
You've got to get on this
if we're gonna blow this thing open.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.997
Hey, I told you, no bomb threats.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.790
It's a metaphor, sport.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.001
And my new plan.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.921
We're going to expose Coventry, The Order,

20:14.004 --> 20:16.882
-the whole Megillah.
-Since when is a witch hunt the plan?

20:17.633 --> 20:20.969
Since I realized all you gotta do
is get me proof The Order exists.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.179
You know...

20:23.055 --> 20:24.890
photos, videotape, hard evidence.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.767
Edward will be destroyed.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.519
He'll be lucky
if he's not burned at the stake.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.271
It won't work, Pops.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.026
-They can time travel, can't they?
-No.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.195
But they can change the way
people remember things.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.697
You know those kids that died
during the selection process?

20:40.781 --> 20:41.657
What kids?

20:41.740 --> 20:42.574
See?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.869
Those sneaky bastards.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.332
Nothing should mess with my memory
except old age and whiskey.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.709
Okay. Okay.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.837
[Dad] We gotta be sneakier.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.257
Tell me everything you know
about these dead kids.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.300
I know that I need to get to class.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.887
Jack, you're in college now.
You can't waste your time studying.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.641
-Coventry is your only priority.
-Pops, we will get him, I promise.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.187
I gotta go.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.480
Order business.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.316
-Get me something I can work with!
-I will.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.110
When?

21:21.488 --> 21:24.324
[Jack] Sorry, I'm late. I was studying.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.289
Oh, no. Today I am gonna teach you
how to perform a cleansing incantation.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.165
We're doing magic now?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.209
It's part of your training.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.214
Relax. No one is setting
their hands on fire.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.385
Okay, now, rule number one,

21:43.593 --> 21:45.137
no unsupervised magic.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.889
And rule number two, all magic has a cost.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.392
A cost? Like a sacrifice?

21:50.475 --> 21:52.561
Sacrifice, or an offering.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.147
If you don't pay the price,
things can go wrong.

21:55.605 --> 21:59.693
Really wrong. That's why I'm going
to teach you how to use magic properly.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.362
Pick up that mortar and pestle.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.743
So, what does a cleansing spell
go for these days?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.079
In this case, the cost is your time.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.873
It's nothing to worry about.

22:12.956 --> 22:13.874
Nothing.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.461
And you're just wanna start
grinding the contents.

22:19.921 --> 22:20.922
Clockwise?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.467
-Counter-clockwise?
-It doesn't matter.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.350
Let me see.

22:32.976 --> 22:33.935
That’s perfect.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.940
Now, grab a pinch of the powder
and sprinkle it onto the altar.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.444
-Yeah. Great. Yep.
-Like that? A pinch?

22:48.241 --> 22:49.659
And I'm just gonna...

22:52.120 --> 22:53.580
It's not hard.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.507
That was magic?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.093
Not so bad.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.388
That wasn't magic. This is.

23:09.888 --> 23:10.722
Alyssa, wait!

23:11.890 --> 23:12.724
What?

23:13.558 --> 23:14.434
I...

23:15.018 --> 23:15.894
I...

23:16.686 --> 23:18.563
[laughs]

23:19.981 --> 23:20.857
I...

23:26.530 --> 23:27.823
I really like you.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.244
And...

23:33.745 --> 23:34.871
And this is a mistake.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.424
[Jack] How'd you do on Benson's quiz?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.551
-I studied Macbeth.
-It was on Hamlet.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.927
Which is why I failed.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.055
So, now I have to read that,
and I still have Clarke's essay to finish.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.974
[girl's voice] What's up, players?

23:54.307 --> 23:57.102
You missed Psych today.
Dr. Morales assigned a paper.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.104
-Already turned it in.
-How?

24:00.188 --> 24:01.189
Hang on.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.154
<i>Quidquid requiritur, fiat.</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:09.281
[ringing sound]

24:10.532 --> 24:11.867
I don't have change for a hundred.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.327
Better go to the bar and get it then.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.164
Of course.
Let me know if you want anything else.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.959

24:21.042 --> 24:22.252

24:22.335 --> 24:25.005
[laughter and clapping]

24:25.088 --> 24:25.922
[waitress] Ouch.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.720
You just paid with a drawing.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.722
So, Jonas keeps asking me out.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.807
I keep telling him no, because he's gross.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.185
Then he starts trying to impress me,

24:38.268 --> 24:39.936
bragging about this glamour spell
he knows.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.398
Says it makes life super-easy.
I ask him to show me.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.942
He wants me to carry out
some gross temple fantasy first.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.402
So, I say,

24:47.944 --> 24:49.779
"Show me the spell, so I know it's legit."

24:51.239 --> 24:52.199
He shows me,

24:52.866 --> 24:54.784
I use it to make him think
we already did it.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.414
You fake-screwed
your way into advanced magic?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.124
Excuse me.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.376
I made sweet, fake love to him.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.171
Downside, now he thinks we're soulmates.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.298
Upside, fifteen minutes with a Sharpie,

25:08.381 --> 25:11.843
all my assignments are completed
and I'll never pay for a latte again.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.721
-I win.
-But...

25:14.804 --> 25:17.766
unsanctioned magic is against the rules.
What if you get caught?

25:17.849 --> 25:20.143
It's hard to be worried
when you're this relaxed.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.562
-Here you go. Your change.
-Yes.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.023
Show me.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.734
Me, too.

Yeah!

Yeah! I don't.

-Endometrial tissue in the uterine lining.

Why would I?

27:39.282 --> 27:42.702
-'Cause he's an untrained, rogue wolf.
-He's not a rogue wolf.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.247
If anything,
he's an emotionally unavailable wolf.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.793
We don't know what he's up to.
Or who he's talking to.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.587
Like you weren't overwhelmed
when you first changed.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.507
-Your point is?
-He needs some time.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.593
-We'll let him process a little longer.
-[ringing starts]

27:58.677 --> 27:59.678
Seriously?

28:00.095 --> 28:00.929
Again?

28:01.221 --> 28:02.055
Let's go.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.476
Quick patrol around the city.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.312
[Lilith] 20th time's the charm.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.402
<i>Quidquid requiritur, fiat.</i>

28:15.485 --> 28:17.112
[almost imperceptible ringing]

28:19.030 --> 28:21.157
Professor Clarke.
Thanks for the extension.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.575
Let's see if it was worth it.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.831
"Empirical Detente.

28:27.914 --> 28:31.126
Unconscious Experience
vs Conscious Action."

28:31.876 --> 28:34.379
-Okay. See you later.
-Jack, stop.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.633
You wrote this yourself?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.678
Everything on that paper
was written by me.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.263
Jack.

28:44.264 --> 28:48.017
I know freshman year can be hard,
but Furzsteiger? Are you screwing with me?

28:48.685 --> 28:50.353
-I don't think so.
-I think you are.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.398
And I love it. I mean, you're...

28:53.690 --> 28:57.318
you're tying in physics
and the observer effect?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.945
I mean, this is incredible.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.656
-It's not that great.
-Jack, Jack, stop.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.075
Learn to take a compliment, okay?
Trust me-- whoa!

29:04.159 --> 29:05.076
Professor!

29:05.160 --> 29:06.911
Jesus! Fuck!

29:07.495 --> 29:09.080
Son of a bitch!

29:09.956 --> 29:12.167
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, fuck. I'm fine.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.002
I'm fine.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.754
Really good work, Jack.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.839
Good work. I'm impressed.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.716
Ow!

29:19.799 --> 29:22.427
Fuck. I hope your bag is okay, dumb-ass.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.762
-Move!
-[crashing sound]

29:24.012 --> 29:25.013
Wow!

29:25.764 --> 29:27.640
Someone leveled up.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.225
Just the essentials.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.810
Stuff I need.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.312
[tapping sound on door]

29:32.395 --> 29:34.939
For example, I really need this pizza.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.818
<i>Quidquid requiritur, fiat.</i>

29:40.987 --> 29:42.155
Thirty-eight, fifty.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.574
-Keep the change.
-Thanks, buddy.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.534
-Any time.
-[man's voice] Hey! Asshole!

29:46.618 --> 29:47.494
[bang]

29:47.577 --> 29:49.704
-What the fuck?
-I told you no anchovies!

29:52.832 --> 29:55.794
Have you guys noticed that weird shit
happens when you do a sigil?

29:57.545 --> 30:00.173
This is Belgrave, okay?
Weird shit is normal.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.216
That is true.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.634
This is pathetic.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.179
We're using magic
to scam pizzas and flat-screens.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.557
You're right.
Maybe we should cool things off a little.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.644
-I like the sigils.
-[girl] Cool things off?

30:13.144 --> 30:16.439
I think it's time
to turn things up a notch.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.025
You know what I'm saying?

30:20.443 --> 30:21.945
-Threesome.
-Bigger magic.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.447
I like her idea better.

30:26.157 --> 30:30.912
[groans of pleasure]

30:31.788 --> 30:33.998
Let's say a professor was giving me grief.

30:34.749 --> 30:35.959
What would you suggest?

30:36.543 --> 30:39.712
Your best bet would be
an Interficio Incantation.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.091
And where would I find a spell like that?

30:45.385 --> 30:47.887
There's a book in the reliquary.

30:47.971 --> 30:51.599
[gasps]

30:51.724 --> 30:52.809
What's it called?

30:53.351 --> 30:55.144
I can't remember. It's...

30:56.145 --> 30:58.064
small and

30:58.147 --> 31:00.525
red with a gold trim.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.195
Oh, yeah.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.656
Okay.

31:11.619 --> 31:12.453
Is this it?

31:14.163 --> 31:15.957
Yeah. Where did you get that?

31:16.499 --> 31:17.917
-Shut up.
-Okay.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.755
Stop.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.884
Why? We basically have a moral obligation
to get this.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.594
Go. Get going.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.973
Oh, my God! We should move in together.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.518
My dad has a place. It'd be great.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.275
Ladies and gentlemen, Gabrielle Dupres.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.152
Thank you, thank you.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.827
Remind me why
we haven't dealt with him yet?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.246
Because we've been running
all over town like idiots,

31:55.330 --> 31:57.457
trying to track down
whoever is doing all this magic.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.336
Ten bucks says it's some frosh testing out
their first set of tarot cards.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.339
-I can't remember it ever being this bad.
-You're kidding, right?

32:04.422 --> 32:06.507
Every year, the new Order recruits
get a taste

32:06.591 --> 32:08.301
and start using magic
on themselves.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.303
[Lilith] It's him.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.221
Look at him.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.267
Yesterday he's thrift store chic
and today he's Mr. Fancy Pants.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.228
Maybe he's gotta do laundry.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.563
No, she's right.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.690
Those pants are fairly fancy.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.109
How is a townie getting magic?

32:27.528 --> 32:31.658
Yeah, I probably should've
mentioned this before, but...

32:32.575 --> 32:33.493
Jack's in The Order.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.328
Shut the fuck up.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.081
So he's in The Hermetic Order
of the Blue Rose.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.668
-That doesn't make him a bad guy.
-They're our sworn enemies.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.462
Which is why having an inside man

32:44.545 --> 32:46.422
is going to be fantastic.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.425
Besides, we don't know
if he's doing the magic or not.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.178
-We'll get confirmation.
-So, we're magic cops now?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.972
We've always been magic cops.

32:54.597 --> 32:55.640
Fair.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.351
[Vera]
Medicums aren't allowed unfettered access

32:58.434 --> 33:00.603
to the reliquary, Miss Drake.
You know that.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.521
I do.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.982
-But Edward has given--
-Edward?

33:05.149 --> 33:08.987
The Grand Magus has given us an assignment
and I need to do some research.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.780
Everyone else is a Magistratus.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.741
They don't need special permission
to enter the reliquary. I do.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.036
What kind of assignment?

33:18.079 --> 33:20.623
I... I don't think I'm supposed to say.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.128
Well, then, that puts you in rather
an awkward situation.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.175
It's an obsidian stone,
protected by magic.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.260
That's all I know.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.638
And that's all I will know,
unless I can use the reliquary.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.307
Did you know

33:38.558 --> 33:40.685
I was the youngest ever practitioner

33:40.768 --> 33:43.354
in the Belgrave chapter
to be made Temple Magus?

33:43.438 --> 33:46.149
Yeah. That was a while ago,
don't you wanna move up?

33:48.151 --> 33:52.405
Ambition can be
a valuable tool, Miss Drake.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.532
But so can restraint.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.326
Palm.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.249
<i>Accessus permittatur.</i>

34:10.339 --> 34:11.674
Don't let it go to your head.

34:13.051 --> 34:13.968
Thank you.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.518
[door busts open]

34:23.186 --> 34:26.230
He's not supposed to change the locks.
Now I have to write him up.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.233
I think you can save the ink.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.652
Okay.

34:31.736 --> 34:35.865
This room is ten times cooler
than it used to be.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.493
But that doesn't prove he's doing magic.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.620
This does.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.334
I still don't think we should kill him.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.753
He's smart.
He got 96% on that.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.255
He's in The Order. We can't trust him.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.758
Silverback picked him for a reason.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.302
-We should to figure out what that is.
-Hey, hey.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.304
Last time I checked, I'm in charge.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.515
And I say there's only one way
we settle this.

35:02.058 --> 35:02.892
[splash]

35:03.184 --> 35:04.143
Ha!

35:04.727 --> 35:07.814
-Drink up, loser.
-And don't spill half of it this time.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.442
What have we become?

35:13.986 --> 35:16.405
We're the Knights of Saint Christopher.

35:17.115 --> 35:21.035
We're supposed to be champions
of all that is good and just.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.496
Defenders of the innocent.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.414
And look at us.

35:26.666 --> 35:31.921
We're letting a game of beer pong
decide if Jack Morton lives or dies?

35:37.844 --> 35:38.678
Fine.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.349
-Best out of three?
-Deal.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.022
[Dad] Nothing now.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.733
You've still got nothing?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.026
Not even a photo?

35:54.694 --> 35:55.570
[laughs]

35:56.696 --> 35:57.905
How hard can this be?

35:58.739 --> 35:59.949
It's pretty hard, Pops.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.784
Magic, remember?

36:03.578 --> 36:05.913
You know what's hard?
Sitting here waiting,

36:06.247 --> 36:08.416
knowing we finally have access to Coventry

36:08.499 --> 36:11.127
while you lounge around
with your thumb up your ass.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.212
That's not even close to what I'm doing.

36:14.046 --> 36:17.133
Well, maybe if you weren't so busy
dressing like some preppy idiot

36:17.216 --> 36:19.552
and studying,
you might have something by now.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.888
Something we can use to destroy him.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.681
Or have you forgotten
what we're doing here?

36:23.764 --> 36:25.933
I never forget. How could I?

36:26.392 --> 36:27.560
It's all you ever talk about.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.521
You wanted this, too.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.024
You wanted revenge for your mother.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.276
[laughs]

36:35.776 --> 36:38.029
-So, what's changed?
-Nothing's changed, Pops.

36:38.112 --> 36:39.488
If you would you just listen to--

36:39.989 --> 36:42.700
You know, you're on that phone
every goddamn second,

36:42.783 --> 36:44.911
you can't get one lousy photo? Come on.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.496
I can take a photo.
I can take a bunch of photos.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.043
<i>Quidquid requiritur, fiat.</i>

36:54.378 --> 36:56.464
Here. I have been taking photos.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.007
This is what happens.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.761
Everyone comes out blank.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.306
Christ!

37:06.724 --> 37:09.560
They must be using some kind of magic
to block the cameras.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.270
Yeah.

37:12.271 --> 37:15.024
And until I can figure out
how to bypass it, we're stuck.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.777
So, please, just get off my back.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.364
Yeah. Sure.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.407
Of course. I'm sorry.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.910
You just had to do show me that.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.580
We're good though, huh? A-okay?

37:29.664 --> 37:31.499
-A-okay.
-A-okay.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.759
[gasps]

37:41.842 --> 37:43.469
-Pops?
-No problem.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.512
Pops!

37:44.762 --> 37:51.102
[gasping and choking]

37:51.560 --> 37:54.522
-My grandfather almost died.
-From a cookie.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.608
We're talking about putting an end
to Benson's pop quizzes.

37:57.692 --> 37:58.901
You can't bail now.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.612
Come on, Jack. It's just a coincidence.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.948
I thought that too, but it's not.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.743
First that waitress, then Prof. Clarke,
and the pizza guy.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.121
Alyssa said magic has a price.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.458
And you know what I'm talking about.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.128
I wasn't gonna cut my finger
to make a $20 bill.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.379
I knew it.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.215
-They paid the price because we didn't.
-Look.

38:21.632 --> 38:25.886
We were stupid with the sigils,
but this is a totally different spell.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.180
We can stop Benson's stupid tests.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.767
And think of the service we'd be providing
to the entire freshman class.

38:31.851 --> 38:32.810
At what cost?

38:32.893 --> 38:36.105
That's the best part.
It doesn't require one.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.774
Right. It's a total freebie.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.026
Guys.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.652
-No.
-Look.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.280
You don't have to help
with the incantation.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.614
Just...

38:46.365 --> 38:48.784
get the book back to the temple
without getting caught.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.828
[Jack] How?
We needed Jonas to get in there.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.289
You'll figure it out.
We'll handle the rest.

38:55.875 --> 38:56.709
Deal?

38:58.669 --> 38:59.545
This is it.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.714
The last one.

39:01.797 --> 39:02.965
Yay!

39:20.608 --> 39:21.859
What are you doing?

39:22.568 --> 39:25.613
You're not allowed in here.
You must leave. Edward will be here soon.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.198
I was just... I was--

39:29.367 --> 39:32.328
Doing unsanctioned magic?
What were you thinking?

39:33.245 --> 39:36.123
-Gabrielle got it from Jonas and she--
-No. Stop. I don't wanna hear it.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.375
The less I know, the better.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.669
You're lucky I'm the one who caught you.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.464
Something like this could get us both
in a lot of trouble.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.425
-I'm being responsible. I'm returning it.
-This could have killed you.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.136
-It's a book.
-A book of murder spells!

39:50.471 --> 39:51.347
Idiot!

39:52.223 --> 39:53.307
[door bangs]

40:01.273 --> 40:02.983
Damn it! You liars.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.197
[male voice] Oh!

40:13.619 --> 40:16.789
[male voice] Ah! Oh!

40:20.668 --> 40:22.670
YOU LOST

40:22.795 --> 40:24.713
FOOD

40:27.216 --> 40:28.926
KILL JACK

40:29.677 --> 40:31.679
Oh.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.278
[Edward] Diego. A hand?

41:03.085 --> 41:04.712
[door closes]

41:04.920 --> 41:08.507
Diego has politely offered to take Selena

41:08.799 --> 41:09.717
to hospital.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.302
He isn't coming back, is he?

41:13.053 --> 41:14.472
He asked to be excused.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.603
There's no shame...

41:22.521 --> 41:23.856
in knowing your limits.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.570
There is something I'd like to try.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.312
<i>Secreta tua revelentur.</i>

42:03.395 --> 42:09.318
[ringing noises]

42:17.952 --> 42:19.870
Selena and Kyle cast attack spells,

42:19.954 --> 42:22.289
but they echoed back, so...

42:23.290 --> 42:24.917
I tried submission instead.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.254
Reverse psychology on an incantation.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.049
-Gotta put that major to use somehow.
-Impressive.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.970
You already knew what spell to use.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.222
I told you it was a test.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.602
Is that paper?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.896
Pages from a very old book.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.651
I hope it's a good one.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.112
It's remarkable.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.213
[banging on door] Professor Benson!

43:12.256 --> 43:13.382
[banging]

43:13.507 --> 43:14.925
Professor Benson!

43:15.759 --> 43:17.011
Oh, thank God.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.138
Office hours are three to five-thirty.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.724
I'm sorry to bother you, Professor,
but I had no other choice.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.143
Well, I can think
of several other choices.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.187
Wait, how do you even know where I live?

43:27.271 --> 43:29.565
You geotag your tweets.
Anyone can find out.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.942
Oh. I didn't know that.

43:33.402 --> 43:35.571
That makes you even creepier.
Why are you here?

43:36.822 --> 43:38.824
Professor, I don't know how to say this.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.493
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.287
This is really not appropriate.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.123
You're a student, I am your professor.
That's all.

43:46.206 --> 43:49.376
It's not that! No. Wait.
It's not that you're not attractive.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.211
-You are--
-Know what? You need to leave.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.380
-Right now.
-You're gonna get hurt.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.090
Are you threatening me?

43:55.257 --> 43:56.508
[ringing starts]

43:56.592 --> 43:57.468
Oh, no.

43:58.135 --> 43:58.969
They did it.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.723
I tried to stop them. I told them not to.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.392
-Are you on drugs?
-Hide!

44:06.435 --> 44:11.607
[ringing intensifies]

44:11.690 --> 44:13.942
[ringing]

44:14.068 --> 44:19.698
Ah! Ah!

44:32.503 --> 44:33.587
Oh, no.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.798
Professor.

44:41.428 --> 44:43.138
Oh, no. No, no.

44:48.894 --> 44:49.895
Oh, God.

44:51.563 --> 44:52.648
Professor Clarke.

44:57.736 --> 44:58.862
I'm a murderer.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.784
And you were my favorite.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.205
I'm really sorry, Professor.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.670
-[sound of flies buzzing]
-[swatting noise]

45:58.380 --> 45:59.381
Pants.

46:01.675 --> 46:02.885
Pants!

46:05.095 --> 46:07.765
I'm really, really sorry.

48:03.755 --> 48:06.049
