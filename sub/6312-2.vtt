WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.325
Previously on Elementary...
I lied the other night

00:03.370 --> 00:05.122
when I said I hadn't
seen the captain.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.297
Because of my transgressions,
neither one of us

00:07.340 --> 00:10.036
will be permitted to consult
for the department again.

00:10.070 --> 00:12.470
Your father called.
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.603
MORLAND: You've made
a mess, Sherlock.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.107
I'm here to fix it.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.111
Oh, what a shame.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.084
History repeats
itself, I'm afraid.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.156
We're out of
Tienchi Flower.

00:27.190 --> 00:28.748
This happens
to you often?

00:28.790 --> 00:30.189
Well, it happened
rather famously

00:30.230 --> 00:32.494
on your one and only visit
to Baker Street.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.259
Or do you not recall
excoriating me

00:34.300 --> 00:36.165
for not stocking
your favorite tea?

00:36.200 --> 00:38.168
It won't happen today.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.428
I gave up Tienchi

00:39.470 --> 00:41.199
in 2003.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.105
Well, despite of our
infrequent correspondence,

00:43.140 --> 00:45.131
I've not forgotten the core
tenets of our relationship,

00:45.170 --> 00:46.637
so I can spare
you the speech.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.136
Ithought
to be a great detective,

00:48.180 --> 00:49.647
one had to be a great listener.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.272
I listened
closely for years.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.449
You're too busy
to have patience for weakness,

00:53.480 --> 00:55.539
real or imagined,
and that hasn't changed.

00:55.580 --> 00:59.357
I don't need reminding
that a relapse is grounds

00:59.390 --> 01:02.279
for eviction.
I told you... I'm here to help.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.729
'Cause that's what you do--
you help people?

01:03.760 --> 01:06.228
I help you... Sherlock.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.228
We might have different
definitions of that word.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.420
Several years ago,

01:09.470 --> 01:11.119
who forced you into rehab?

01:11.170 --> 01:13.161
Who paired you
with Miss Watson?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.634
Who set you on the path
from which you have fallen?

01:15.670 --> 01:18.138
So tell me, Father, how are you
to help me this time?

01:18.170 --> 01:21.537
Give your assent,
and I will see you restored

01:21.580 --> 01:24.469
to the employ of
the New York Police Department.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.444
Why would you do that?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.778
When you had your troubles
in London,

01:28.820 --> 01:31.584
I lost faith in you.

01:31.620 --> 01:34.282
I provided for you in New York

01:34.320 --> 01:37.357
because I wanted you
out of sight and mind.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.649
Little did I know

01:40.700 --> 01:42.668
that the untended corner
of the garden

01:42.700 --> 01:44.258
would grow so strong
and healthy.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.189
Yes, I'm quite robust--
seven whole days sober.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.802
I'm not talking
about the last few days.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.173
I'm talking about
the last few years.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.678
I respect what
you've built here,

01:57.710 --> 02:00.838
the work you've done.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.417
I'm proud of you.

02:04.790 --> 02:07.258
Didn't think I would be.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.679
In the early days,

02:09.730 --> 02:12.893
Miss Watson and I
communicated by e-mail.

02:12.930 --> 02:16.764
She described the support system
you were building.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.930
How your job at the department
was an important part of it.

02:20.970 --> 02:23.268
You have structure
there, friends.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.200
I fear that without it,
you'd struggle.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.777
I have Watson,
I have a program,

02:29.810 --> 02:32.210
and the department does
not have a monopoly

02:32.250 --> 02:33.615
on investigative work.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.289
Perhaps I'm wrong to worry.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.709
You know how often I'm wrong.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.353
I don't know how long
I'll be in New York,

02:45.390 --> 02:47.722
but the_offer is
a standing one.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.797
Quite simple for me to reverse
your status with the police

02:50.830 --> 02:53.560
if that's what you
and Miss Watson want.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.636
Well, I can't speak for her.

02:55.670 --> 02:58.309
Of course not.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.638
I am hoping
you will introduce us,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.500
so I can extend
the same offer myself.

03:04.550 --> 03:05.903
And I want to thank her.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.843
She saved my son's life.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.386
("William Tell Overture"
Playing)

03:17.430 --> 03:20.297
MAN:
Taxes should be raised
on the rich.

03:20.330 --> 03:24.289
A: agree.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.890
B: disagree.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.966
("William Tell Overture"
continues playing)

03:30.010 --> 03:33.332
Hey, Dr. Sarkisian,
I-I need a break.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.349
The minimum wage
should be raised.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.803
A: agree, B: disagree.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.647
Seriously, I don't want
to screw up your study,

03:40.680 --> 03:42.682
but I can't take it anymore.
Give me a minute, all right?

03:42.720 --> 03:46.816
Terrorists do not deserve
due process.

03:46.860 --> 03:51.524
A: agree, B: disagree.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.923
(explosions, rapid gunfire)
Both legal

03:55.960 --> 03:57.393
and illegal immigration
should be curbed.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.466
Hello?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.297
A: agree.
(screaming and gunfire
on screen)

04:01.340 --> 04:02.602
Are you guys in there?

04:02.640 --> 04:06.508
B: disagree.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.679
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

04:08.710 --> 04:12.248
*

04:15.020 --> 04:16.681
(door opens)

04:18.850 --> 04:20.351
(gunshot)

04:20.390 --> 04:22.722
*

04:28.960 --> 04:30.860
Hey.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.868
Have you been sitting there
since last night?

04:34.870 --> 04:36.758
Last night, I came home,
you said you were thinking,

04:36.810 --> 04:37.902
I went to bed.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.305
You're dressed for work.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.377
You seem slow today.
Not great timing.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.549
We're due at the scene
of a triple homicide.

04:44.580 --> 04:45.979
What?

04:46.010 --> 04:47.875
We have a job interview.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.842
Sort of. Audition might be
a better way of putting it.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.846
With whom?
Gary Burke. He's FBI.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.688
I met him while
you were working for MI6.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.982
He's a little buttoned-up,
but I think

04:56.020 --> 04:57.829
he's the kind of guy
we can get along with.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.521
Well, he is,
if he's routinely in charge

04:59.560 --> 05:00.549
of triple homicide
investigations.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.953
I don't know how routine it is,

05:02.000 --> 05:03.797
but he caught one this morning.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.525
Three dead at a neuro-economics
lab In Harlem.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.629
Some top-secret research
was stolen.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.798
I convinced him
that he could use our expertise

05:10.840 --> 05:12.102
in neuro-economics.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.903
Are you an expert
in neuro-economics?

05:13.940 --> 05:18.479
I mean, compared
to an FBI agent, apparently.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.375
We can bone up on the way.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.115
He's the only one
who called me back.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.846
Do you want to work or not?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.957
Joan. It's nice_
to see you again.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.924
You, too.
You must be Mr. Holmes.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.621
Special Agent Gary Burke.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.423
Thank you for the invitation.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.960
Yeah, about that.
A few ground rules.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.833
I know you guys are used
to having some latitude,

05:40.870 --> 05:43.009
but on this, you go
where I go, and that's it.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.962
Got it?

05:45.010 --> 05:47.729
Okay. We got
two dead scientists,

05:47.780 --> 05:49.668
one dead test subject,

05:49.710 --> 05:51.598
and seven hard drives stolen.

05:51.650 --> 05:54.574
Janitors found the_bodies
early this morning.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.611
Would we be right
in assuming that one

05:56.650 --> 05:58.982
of the stolen computers had
the surveillance video on it?

05:59.020 --> 06:01.784
You would.
And the contents
of the other six are the reason

06:01.820 --> 06:04.687
that this is a matter
for the FBI and not the NYPD?

06:04.730 --> 06:07.153
Yes, but, uh, let our DARPA
buddies explain the rest.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.997
They just arrived, too.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.890
Morning.
MAN:
Good morning.

06:13.940 --> 06:17.034
Samuel Meher. Deputy Director.
This is Alta Von See,

06:17.070 --> 06:18.765
our head of special projects.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.004
The director wanted to be
here himself, but he had

06:20.040 --> 06:22.440
to brief Congressional
Oversight.
About this?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.902
We fund hundreds of projects,

06:23.950 --> 06:26.043
but these researchers are really
onto something special here.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.446
This is more than a tragedy
for the families.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.017
The work that was taken--
it's big.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.610
I assume you're at liberty to
use more precise descriptives

06:33.660 --> 06:34.911
to explain what was stolen?

06:34.960 --> 06:37.155
How much do you know
about neuro-economics?

06:37.190 --> 06:40.899
We're experts.
Well, I'm not,
so go slow.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.626
Dr. Sarkisian and Dr. Weller

06:43.670 --> 06:45.695
were mapping the loci
in the brain

06:45.730 --> 06:48.164
that light up
when emotional responses

06:48.200 --> 06:51.033
are triggered,
when opinions change.
They were using

06:51.070 --> 06:52.207
the data to perfect
an algorithm.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.175
It works a little like
a personalized search.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.940
The program curates the news
a user reads online.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.572
Cu rates?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.043
The program learns what kind
of stories you respond to

07:02.080 --> 07:05.516
and gives you more of what
you want, as a delivery system

07:05.550 --> 07:07.086
for favorable narratives.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.953
It renders users' opinions
more fluid.
In a nutshell,

07:09.990 --> 07:12.151
Agent Burke, they're perfecting
the art of brainwashing.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.795
MEHER: Well, that's not
how we'd put it.

07:14.830 --> 07:18.129
It's... a weapon
of soft power.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.536
Sarkisian and Weller
hadn't presented the results.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.094
They weren't out
of beta-testing.

07:22.140 --> 07:25.132
But we had high hopes.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.535
(camera shutter clicking)

07:26.580 --> 07:28.070
BURKE:
Dr. Gail Sarkisian.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.975
Figure she was
killed first.

07:30.010 --> 07:31.807
She's closest to the door.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.819
Shots fired from
extremely close range.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.738
Dr. Frank Weller was next.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.145
Shooter double-tapped
him, too. Smooth.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.885
Like a pro.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.751
The test subject
in the next room

07:42.790 --> 07:45.088
was a grad
student volunteer.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.223
_ Ollie Tate.
No srgns of a struggle.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.569
Everything must have
happened quickly.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.228
BURKE: Like I said,
we're looking at a pro.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.693
Mr. Holmes?

07:55.940 --> 07:59.068
This rat is quite
recently dead.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.032
There are no_ visible
Signs of Injury.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.101
Well, there was a lot
of commotion last night.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.277
Maybe he had a tiny
rat heart attack.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.518
You jest, but rats are quite
prone to cardiovascular disease.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.587
How do you think the
killer got inside?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.054
I think perhaps
Dr. Sarkisian let him in.

08:17.090 --> 08:19.126
Perhaps she knew him.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.094
On the way in here,
we passed through two doors

08:21.130 --> 08:23.792
which required a key card
for access.

08:23.830 --> 08:27.698
Dr. Sarkisian's is not hanging
on the lanyard around her neck,

08:27.740 --> 08:31.039
as is Dr. Weller's, so...

08:34.280 --> 08:37.602
She was shot
after walking the killer inside.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.868
Mm.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.172
Doesn't look like she kept
much personal stuff here.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.541
Want to get
to know her better.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.080
We should talk to her
family and friends.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.008
Maybe go to her
home, poke around?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.186
We've already got
a team there.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.154
Should we meet them there?

08:51.190 --> 08:54.819
I've got to finish up here,
stay in my lane,

08:54.860 --> 08:57.829
but if you two want
to take off now, that's fine.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.168
"Take off" as in go home?

09:00.200 --> 09:03.260
We want to be as
helpful as we can, Gary.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.107
Our schedule's pretty
open right now.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.779
(sighs)

09:07.810 --> 09:10.176
If we think we need a hand
with anything we find

09:10.210 --> 09:13.247
at Dr. Sarkisian's,
we'll send it to you.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.249
Good enough?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.248
HOLMES:
Whilst it's certainly

09:18.290 --> 09:21.157
convenient to investigate
from the comfort of one's home,

09:21.190 --> 09:22.657
I do find the FBI's

09:22.690 --> 09:24.749
team approach a
little off-putting.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.280
We're a team.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.928
I'm confused as to
how much help we can be

09:30.970 --> 09:32.665
attached to Agent
Burke's hip.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.759
A murder investigation is
not a three-legged race.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.109
Well, we prove ourselves
on this one,

09:37.140 --> 09:39.973
and maybe they give a little
more leeway on the next one.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.103
Or we could
return to the NYPD

09:42.140 --> 09:44.301
where our colleagues
already know our worth.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.102
What are you talking about?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.675
I met with Father yesterday.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.018
He's offered_ to resurrect our
consultancy With the department.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.780
Wait. You actually
saw your father?

09:53.820 --> 09:56.152
He came here while you
were running errands.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.329
Are you okay?

09:58.360 --> 10:00.021
Do I seem otherwise?

10:00.060 --> 10:02.153
Well, you haven't
seen him in what...

10:02.200 --> 10:05.192
five years, more?

10:05.230 --> 10:08.267
Look, I think it's nice that
he wants to help, but you know

10:08.300 --> 10:10.860
we can't go back to the
department-- it's not possible.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.299
Neither was war in the
Falklands, but the old man tends

10:13.340 --> 10:15.399
to get what he wants.
I can't _tell if _
you're being serious right now.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.408
How much do you really
know of my father?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.317
We've rarely broached the terms
of your initial employment.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.318
Mostly I dealt
with people under him.

10:22.350 --> 10:24.238
I know he's some sort
of International consultant.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.714
It is true, I am not the first
consultant in the family,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.682
but the title is where
the similarities end.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.152
Father's business exists

10:31.190 --> 10:33.329
to grease the skids

10:33.360 --> 10:34.850
so that politicians

10:34.900 --> 10:36.822
and corporations can operate
around the globe.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.292
Sometimes these are
noble ventures.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.298
More often, they are not.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.968
But they happen because
Father is an influence peddler

10:43.010 --> 10:44.307
par excellence.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.036
And if he says he can
restore us, he means it.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.049
What did you say?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.173
I did not.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.848
I'm not sure
it would be worth the cost.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.211
What cost?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.239
The one we would incur

10:56.280 --> 10:57.315
by accepting his offer.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.011
Did he ask us to do something?

10:59.050 --> 11:01.359
No, but it's only
a matter of time.

11:01.390 --> 11:04.086
With him,
there is always a cost.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.280
The toll always comes due.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.057
Aanay. . .

11:09.100 --> 11:11.193
it's not my decision to make,

11:11.230 --> 11:13.767
it's ours.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.136
Well, he's your father.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.365
But as you said, we are a team.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.207
You deserve a chance

11:21.240 --> 11:24.209
to meet the man,
find out if Morland Holmes

11:24.250 --> 11:26.400
is someone you want
to be indebted to.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.382
I find the Chinese character
suspICIous, don't you?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.217
Not their national fiber...

11:35.260 --> 11:37.125
the marking on this note.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.954
It means "beautiful."

11:41.000 --> 11:42.297
I am aware.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.264
The indentations
on the card reveal

11:44.300 --> 11:46.768
that it was used
in a bouquet.
"August 20--

11:46.800 --> 11:49.394
a day I will never forget.
XO, DZ."

11:49.440 --> 11:52.773
"D Zed" sent
three more bouquets

11:52.810 --> 11:54.277
with similar notes.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.335
Dr. Sarkisian's little-used
socral media accounts

11:56.380 --> 11:58.803
are peppered
with risqu communiqus

11:58.850 --> 12:01.318
from a "DiplomatDan."

12:01.350 --> 12:04.478
Now, as luck would have it,
there is a Dan Zheng

12:04.520 --> 12:07.853
who works as a staffer
at China's UN. mission.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.357
So DZ,

12:09.390 --> 12:12.257
Dan Zheng, DiplomatDan,
they're one and the same?

12:12.290 --> 12:15.418
I think "SpyDan" might be
a more accurate moniker.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.894
Perhaps even "KillerDan."

12:17.930 --> 12:19.397
He wouldn't be the
first covert operative

12:19.430 --> 12:22.069
_ to travel with _
diplomatic immunity.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.068
Zheng's functional immunity
would not extend to murder,

12:24.110 --> 12:26.032
but he could make sense
as a triggerman.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.231
He's been pitching woo
at Dr. Sarkisian for months,

12:28.280 --> 12:30.407
so she may have
let him into the building.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.247
Okay, but what about a motive?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.248
Spies don't have motives;
they have orders.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.043
I mean China's motive.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.241
PRC government already controls
Internet access pretty tightly.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.884
What would they want with, uh,
Gail Sarkisian's research?

12:40.920 --> 12:43.252
In my experience,
those with a great deal of power

12:43.290 --> 12:45.884
are often the same people
who want a great deal more.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.158
There's little doubt
that the Communist Party

12:47.200 --> 12:50.089
has an extensive and illustrious
track record With propaganda,

12:50.130 --> 12:52.098
and then
Drs. Weller and Sarkisian

12:52.130 --> 12:55.236
come along and perfect the art--
so the question then becomes:

12:55.270 --> 12:58.068
Did China kill to acquire it?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.476
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:00.510 --> 13:03.001
That's quite all right--
while we awaited your arrival,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.041
we entertained ourselves
by watching our betters

13:05.080 --> 13:07.139
as they processed
Mr. Zheng's apartment.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.011
BURKE:
It's like I told you,

13:09.050 --> 13:12.315
consultants need a chaperone--
we are the FBI.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.853
Kind of big on the rules.
What do we got?

13:14.890 --> 13:17.358
You've seen it all except
the moldy peach in the fridge.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.324
Management says rent was
paid six months in advance.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.453
Hard to say when
this guy ghosted.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.196
We saw some of your agents out
there talking to his neighbors.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.221
Nobody's seen Mr. Zheng
in at least a month.

13:26.270 --> 13:27.464
Sounds like everyone
in the building

13:27.500 --> 13:29.900
kind of hated him.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.532
You guys missed this.

13:33.110 --> 13:36.329
Looks like _
an old n0ise complaint.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.508
Well, it would seem we're on the
hunt for the least competent spy

13:39.550 --> 13:41.415
China's employed
since the Ming Dynasty.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.384
He's ahead of us so far.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.014
This apartment's a stone's throw
from Times Square,

13:46.050 --> 13:48.416
the noisiest part of
the noisiest city in the world,

13:48.460 --> 13:50.883
and yet, Mr. Zheng still managed
to rile his neighbors.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.352
If he's that bad

13:52.390 --> 13:53.527
at blending in,

13:53.560 --> 13:55.391
he'll leave a trail a mile wide.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.898
Yeah. Well...

13:57.930 --> 13:59.898
we don't need a trail.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.261
We just need a ping.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.003
Not a blip, not a bleep.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.406
The stolen computers have got
to be at least a mile away.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.476
So that would tell us
if they were closer?

14:10.510 --> 14:12.000
It's a cell phone
tower simulator.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.473
It sucks up every signal
in a ten-block radius.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.169
When DARPA funds
classified research,

14:16.220 --> 14:19.610
the grant recipients have
to use DARPA computers.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.016
So the laptops that were stolen,

14:22.060 --> 14:24.483
they all have a small,
battery-powered 4G router,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.522
and it would ping if
this unit was close enough.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.866
Listen...
guys, we got to talk.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.503
I'm impressed with how
quickly you dug this guy up.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.998
His disappearing act
is pretty suspicious.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.679
But... this is
probably gonna be the end

14:44.710 --> 14:47.213
of the line on this one,
at least for you guys.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.512
Gary, you know
we can help.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.189
I've seen cases _
less sen5itive than this

14:51.220 --> 14:53.654
get whisked
out of my hands by DC.

14:53.690 --> 14:55.578
My bosses will do
everything in their power

14:55.620 --> 14:57.520
to keep a lid on this.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.994
They won't want to tip Zheng so
he runs, and they sure as hell

15:00.030 --> 15:02.225
won't_ want _to start
a slap fight With China.

15:03.730 --> 15:06.938
This whole thing is gonna be
sorted out very quietly

15:06.970 --> 15:09.438
and at a very high level.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.267
No, you're wrong.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.437
Excuse me?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.277
This isn't gonna
be handled by DC,

15:15.310 --> 15:16.971
and it's not
gonna be qUIet.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.648
It's gonna be loud.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.690
TV NEWSWOMAN:
...as calls intensify
for accountability from DARPA,

15:32.730 --> 15:35.699
State Department officials won't
say if the Chinese government

15:35.730 --> 15:38.062
will respond
tonight or tomorrow.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.193
No additional information
is available...

15:40.240 --> 15:42.231
Good news.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.238
I'm not the leak, either.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.067
Not the most bracing
interrogation

15:46.110 --> 15:47.532
I've experienced,
but I thought their technique

15:47.580 --> 15:48.729
was adequate. You?

15:48.780 --> 15:50.202
Sorry about the third degree,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.548
but you get
why it had to be done.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.241
New people, new leak.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.713
Your superiors have
reason to be panicked.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.139
I'm n_ot_sure whether_ the
media is more exerCIsed

15:58.190 --> 16:01.079
about the existence
of a propaganda program
or the fact that it was

16:01.120 --> 16:03.224
insufficiently guarded.
I think DC's more concerned

16:03.260 --> 16:04.659
with how this affects
the manhunt.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.227
If Zheng wasn't
on the run before, he is now.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.767
I want to thank you both
for all your help.
We just got cleared.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.665
You're gonna
cut us loose now?
I'm sorry.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.792
We're in crisis mode here.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.637
We're circling the wagons.
Perhaps you'd
reconsider

16:16.670 --> 16:19.138
ifI could tell you where
you'll likely find Dan Zheng.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.205
What do you mean?

16:20.240 --> 16:23.505
Well, my theory is admittedly
in its larval stage.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.479
Its development
is being hampered

16:26.510 --> 16:28.148
by a lack of access.
There's only so much

16:28.180 --> 16:30.648
to be gleaned by glimpsing
through a crack in a door.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.317
You give us just a moment
inside that room,

16:32.350 --> 16:34.659
and then tell us
whether we belong in your wagon.

16:34.690 --> 16:38.023
Well, as you can see,
there's a silver lining

16:38.060 --> 16:40.199
to the leak--
11 million New Yorkers

16:40.230 --> 16:42.152
have_bec_ome de facto
deputies in your search.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.690
And at least one
of their tips

16:43.730 --> 16:46.528
was legitimate-- Zheng was seen
at the World Trade Center.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.697
We have a mobile team rolling
at the World Trade Center?

16:48.740 --> 16:50.503
No pings yet, but we got
25 people canvassing.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.132
HOLMES:
I might suggest

16:52.170 --> 16:54.331
a more promising place
to trawl for your quarry.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.699
I'm reasonably sure

16:55.740 --> 16:57.674
that that satchel
Mr. Zheng is carrying

16:57.710 --> 17:00.349
is a drummer's bag--
it's meant for skins and sticks.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.369
There were some strange

17:01.420 --> 17:02.409
indentations in the carpet

17:02.450 --> 17:03.781
at Mr. Zheng's apartment.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.219
In light of the
noise complaint

17:05.250 --> 17:06.581
that Watson found,
and now that bag...

17:06.620 --> 17:08.156
Um, well, they were
made by a drum kit.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.784
So what?
WATSON: So that
noise complaint

17:10.830 --> 17:12.286
was over a year old.
Kit's gone,

17:12.330 --> 17:14.252
but he obviously still
has some of his gear.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.291
He's been playing
somewhere else.

17:16.330 --> 17:19.265
There are seven different
state and federal

17:19.300 --> 17:21.268
law enforcement agencies
hunting this guy,

17:21.300 --> 17:25.168
and you think he was on his way
to practice his drumming?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.474
There's a subway station beneath
that building with access

17:27.510 --> 17:29.307
to the 1 train
and Columbus Circle,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.103
home to the Bernstein
MUSIC Conservatory,

17:31.150 --> 17:32.640
being the densest concentration
of music rehearsal spaces

17:32.680 --> 17:34.318
in the city-- I could
think of worse places

17:34.350 --> 17:36.238
to lie low.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.611
Let's pull a
team together.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.187
It's worth a shot.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.778
Did we earn our place?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.457
For now.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.321
Hey, we should
tell your father

17:47.360 --> 17:49.351
we're not gonna make it
to his office.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.129
Last time
I missed a meeting with him,

17:51.170 --> 17:53.195
it took years to get back on
the calendar, so you should go.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.639
On my own?

17:54.670 --> 17:56.262
Well, my absence might
be a good thing.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.302
I tend to be a distraction
when I'm around Father.

17:58.340 --> 18:01.207
I look forward
to your thoughts.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.342
Mr. Holmes?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.880
Miss Watson is here.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.558
Miss Watson.

18:13.590 --> 18:15.285
At long last.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.426
I assume_ Sherlock
won't be joming us.

18:18.460 --> 18:19.859
Yes, work intrudes.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.448
I'm sure you, of all people,
understand.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.266
Just as well. I wanted a chance
to get to know you myself.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.597
Please.

18:26.630 --> 18:29.531
I wish my business brought me
to New York more often.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.435
Yes, this is
a nice office

18:31.470 --> 18:33.404
to never use.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.409
I gather my son told you
a bit about me.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.274
His opinions, his...
colorful renderings of our past.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.880
I know you two
don't get along.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.740
If you think that Sherlock
is the only one

18:44.790 --> 18:46.746
who considers me an enemy,
you'd be wrong.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.587
He doesn't consider you
an enemy.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.383
An antagonist, then.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.580
No. I think he
just thinks...

18:52.630 --> 18:54.427
you're a terrible father.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.438
I assume he explained my offer.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.665
He said that
you could get

19:03.710 --> 19:06.201
the NYPD to take us back.
He made it sound like

19:06.240 --> 19:07.707
you could just wave
a wand, or something.

19:07.740 --> 19:11.369
I wouldn't wave a wand,
I would pick up a phone.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.344
And what do you want in return?

19:13.380 --> 19:14.415
Nothing.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.713
You find that hard
to believe?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.718
I find it hard to believe

19:19.750 --> 19:22.548
that charity brought you
to a place like this.
Charity didn't.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.528
Solving problems did.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.879
Mm.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.728
Is that what Sherlock and I are?
Problems?

19:30.730 --> 19:33.858
Heroin is a problem, Joan.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.460
You know that
better than most.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.670
When I hired you
to tend to my son,

19:41.710 --> 19:44.372
I had no idea
I was teeing up a partnership.

19:44.410 --> 19:46.378
Nor did I foresee
the benefits

19:46.410 --> 19:48.378
of working
with the American police.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.241
But it happened, it worked.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.558
I want it to work again.

19:56.590 --> 19:58.421
We got a bounce
in the computers here

19:58.460 --> 20:00.599
on the southwest corner
of this block.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.552
I want Marshall and Barrios

20:02.600 --> 20:04.227
to take the even floors.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.760
O'Neill, Singer,
you take the odds.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.439
Now, you get any pushback,
anybody wants to see a warrant,

20:08.470 --> 20:09.562
you hit me on the radio,

20:09.600 --> 20:10.737
we'll line it up.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.260
No shortcuts.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.403
Okay? Let's go.

20:15.940 --> 20:18.340
(phone buzzing)

20:20.920 --> 20:22.740
I'm feeling a bit
vestigial at the moment.

20:22.780 --> 20:25.578
I'll, um... just be
in the coffee shop.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.451
BURKE:
Okay.

20:28.490 --> 20:29.559
Yeah, it's Burke.

20:29.590 --> 20:32.479
Yeah, they're
on their way in.

20:32.530 --> 20:34.498
Yeah,
I'll let you know.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.293
I will. Yeah.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.321
*

20:43.940 --> 20:46.500
You forgot to assign...

20:53.650 --> 20:55.641
*

21:15.600 --> 21:18.433
BURKE:
If he has a summons, just make
it clear he's not here about...

21:18.470 --> 21:20.700
Where'd you get that?

21:20.740 --> 21:23.072
One day you're going to have
to explain to your agents

21:23.110 --> 21:24.839
whether B is odd or even.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.372
B as in "basement."

21:28.420 --> 21:29.944
The other things were too
far down in the Dumpster

21:29.980 --> 21:31.481
to reach without getting
absolutely filthy.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.612
But I'm sure you've
got people for that.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.550
That was in the trash?
I assume

21:34.590 --> 21:36.854
(phone buzzing)
Mr. Zheng put it there
after he copied

21:36.890 --> 21:38.551
the research and wiped
the surveillance footage

21:38.590 --> 21:40.558
of the three murders
he committed.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.625
Yeah, it's Burke.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.927
You're kidding me.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.892
(clears throat)

21:47.940 --> 21:49.931
On my way.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.106
Dan Zheng just
turned himself in.

21:54.140 --> 21:57.075
Says he's innocent.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.408
It is beyond dispute

21:59.450 --> 22:00.712
that my client
could not have authored

22:00.750 --> 22:02.547
the tragic events in Harlem.

22:02.580 --> 22:03.979
He was at the symphony

22:04.020 --> 22:05.510
here in Manhattan
when they occurred.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.484
And yet your news media

22:07.520 --> 22:09.681
has turned him into
an international pariah.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.620
No one has made the claim
that Mr. Zheng

22:11.660 --> 22:12.684
pulled the trigger
himself.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.357
The relevant fact remains

22:14.400 --> 22:15.628
his relationship to
one of the decedents.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.525
Mr. Zheng could've
called Dr. Sarkisian

22:17.570 --> 22:18.298
and induced her _
to welcome an accomplice.

22:18.330 --> 22:19.661
Please, forgive
the interruption.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.497
We can't control

22:21.540 --> 22:22.495
what the press
has been writing.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.734
No, of course.

22:23.770 --> 22:24.998
It is a free country,

22:25.040 --> 22:26.530
as you are all
so fond of saying.

22:26.570 --> 22:29.368
And yet my client
falls under suspicion

22:29.410 --> 22:32.140
for having once dated
an unmarried woman.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.477
Are you at least going
to ask him how the computers

22:33.520 --> 22:34.839
came to be found
on the same block

22:34.880 --> 22:36.142
as rehearsal space
rented in his name?

22:36.180 --> 22:38.387
Every person in
this hemisphere

22:38.420 --> 22:40.411
knew Mr. Zheng
was your suspect.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.519
The culprit clearly
dumped the CPUs

22:42.560 --> 22:43.879
in your path
to frame him

22:43.930 --> 22:46.387
and, by extension, our country.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.590
You have nothing.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.669
Hey.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.860
What are you doing?

22:53.900 --> 22:55.868
Working.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.663
In my office?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.029
Technically,
it's my father's office.

22:59.070 --> 23:00.503
Or did he sweeten
the offer today

23:00.540 --> 23:01.871
and throw in the brownstone?

23:01.910 --> 23:03.775
What did you think of him?
I don't know.

23:03.810 --> 23:06.108
I mean, in some ways he was
exactly what I was picturing.

23:06.150 --> 23:07.617
In some ways, he wasn't.

23:07.650 --> 23:08.674
Explain.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.608
No horns,

23:10.650 --> 23:12.481
for one thing...
no pitchfork.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.954
And he seemed pretty sincere
about what he wanted for you.

23:14.990 --> 23:17.117
The most confounding part.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.980
I mean, I'm still
thinking it over,

23:19.030 --> 23:20.520
but...

23:20.560 --> 23:21.754
I didn't get the impression

23:21.800 --> 23:23.688
_ we need to_r_ush
into any deCI5ions.

23:23.730 --> 23:26.096
No_r_should we. Not at such
a critical moment in our case.

23:26.130 --> 23:27.631
I thought we got benched.

23:27.670 --> 23:28.830
What is all this?

23:28.870 --> 23:29.996
Well, that depends.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.632
On...?

23:31.670 --> 23:33.706
On how you feel
about being made

23:33.740 --> 23:35.628
an accessory
after the fact.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.978
When I found the
stolen computers today,

23:38.010 --> 23:39.944
I had a moment alone, so...

23:39.980 --> 23:42.175
I sent myself copies of
Dr. Sarkisian's data--

23:42.220 --> 23:43.949
correspondence,
notes, etcetera.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.515
That is extremely illegal.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.949
But entirely prudent.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.958
Who knows how long
it's gonna take the FBI

23:49.990 --> 23:51.821
to draw all
the proper inferences

23:51.860 --> 23:53.691
and realize that China
is owed an apology?

23:53.730 --> 23:54.856
What are you talking about?

23:58.570 --> 24:00.663
Are you able to detect

24:00.700 --> 24:04.067
a difference
between these two?

24:06.110 --> 24:08.237
No.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.646
I mean, it's been a while
since my neurology rotation.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.568
Should I?
Another test of your ability

24:12.610 --> 24:14.976
to compare and contrast.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.089
Are they the same
or different?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.929
They're identical.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.224
Yes. Except
in one key respect--

24:27.260 --> 24:29.592
the dates at which
they were administered.

24:29.630 --> 24:31.495
They are
before-and-after surveys

24:31.530 --> 24:32.929
from Sarkisian

24:32.970 --> 24:34.130
and Weller's experiments.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.592
They were beta-testing
their algorithm.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.961
Volunteer subjects were
put through a battery

24:38.010 --> 24:41.275
of brainwashing protocols,
and none of them worked,

24:41.310 --> 24:42.902
at all.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.272
So this guy was especially
resistant to propaganda?

24:45.310 --> 24:47.517
They all were.
Hundreds of grad students

24:47.550 --> 24:49.245
signed up to be guinea pigs.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.941
DARPA's proprietary algorithm,

24:50.990 --> 24:52.617
meant to change
hearts and minds,

24:52.650 --> 24:54.515
couldn't nudge anyone

24:54.560 --> 24:56.653
from "mildly supporting"
to "mildly opposing"

24:56.690 --> 24:58.248
even the most milquetoast
of policies.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.622
Retiring the penny, for example.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.299
That's some
pretty bad propaganda.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.594
Dr. Sarkisian
admitted as much herself.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.689
She wrote an e-mail
to her partner

25:07.740 --> 25:09.731
stating her intent to withdraw

25:09.770 --> 25:11.738
a grant proposal
for further funding.

25:11.770 --> 25:13.203
And Weller concurred.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.174
"Our current understanding
of neurological processes

25:15.210 --> 25:17.678
"is simply not sufficient
to design a system

25:17.710 --> 25:20.178
by which those processes can be
effectively manipulated."

25:20.210 --> 25:21.848
If Dan Zheng

25:21.880 --> 25:25.008
is to be believed-- and I think
at this point he is--

25:25.050 --> 25:27.587
his last assignation
with Gail Sarkisian

25:27.620 --> 25:30.054
was the same day
this e-mail was sent.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.626
So you think she told him
that her program

25:31.660 --> 25:32.854
was a dud,
and he lost interest.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.858
He learned what
he had been sent to learn

25:34.900 --> 25:36.754
and then reported back
to the PRC government

25:36.800 --> 25:39.689
that they had nothing to gain--
and nothing to fear--

25:39.730 --> 25:41.766
from an American
propaganda program.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.768
So the Chinese didn't do it.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.107
Worse than that, Watson.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.176
I think three people
died for nothing.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.741
I think we have
to tell the FBI.

25:55.780 --> 25:59.614
Tell them what? That I stole
some top secret research?

25:59.650 --> 26:02.210
Or that we have eliminated
one billion Chinese suspects

26:02.260 --> 26:05.149
in favor of one _
neo-reactionary monarchist?

26:05.190 --> 26:07.988
I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that, no.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.692
But Maurice Antonov_ has
two really good motives.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.994
Only one of which we're
adequately prepared to present.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.294
So why not just go with that?

26:15.340 --> 26:17.831
The guy divorced Gail Sarkisian
six months ago.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.805
Ex-husband hates ex-wife--
kills her, kills the witnesses.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.330
Stealing the computers
may have just been

26:22.380 --> 26:24.200
a way to throw everyone
off the scent.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.343
I'd rather not present
a theory of the crime

26:26.380 --> 26:29.178
I do not believe.
Simple stories sell.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.847
You've been reading
too much propaganda theory.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.710
I do not wish
to bamboozle the FBI

26:32.750 --> 26:35.059
into pursuing Mr. Antonov--
I want to question him myself.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.183
And if he fits,
present a complete thesis

26:37.220 --> 26:38.824
of his true motive.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.225
This is a man

26:40.260 --> 26:42.194
who blogs as Henry IX,

26:42.230 --> 26:43.720
who advocates
for the restoration

26:43.770 --> 26:46.330
of a Tudor-style monarchy
in the let century.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.031
Yeah, but being a kook

26:48.070 --> 26:50.391
doesn't make him less likely
to be a killer.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.704
My point
is that if Antonov did do it,

26:52.740 --> 26:54.879
it might not be because
he grew to hate his ex-wife,

26:54.910 --> 26:57.743
but because he was
still in love with her work.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.345
Sarkisian's earliest experiments
were designed

27:02.380 --> 27:05.281
to push her subjects
towards neo-fascist beliefs

27:05.320 --> 27:07.959
about the failings
of democracy,

27:07.990 --> 27:10.117
a protocol Antonov suggested.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.287
I submit that he hoped
his wife's software

27:12.330 --> 27:14.321
could sell his ideas
to the masses.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.796
Yeah, but we don't know if he
still thought that was possible,

27:17.830 --> 27:20.663
or if he knew the propaganda
algorithm was a failure.
Precisely.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.863
It should be a simple enough
question to ask the man.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.003
MAN:
Congratulations.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.702
I-I didn't realize
I had dropped enough clues

27:28.740 --> 27:30.435
for anybody to find me.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.846
But you are
the first of my followers

27:32.880 --> 27:35.815
to uncover my identity.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.989
Why are you anonymous,
Mr. Antonov?

27:38.020 --> 27:41.353
Won't it be more difficult
to hasten the demise
of the American imperium

27:41.390 --> 27:43.312
from behind
a pseudonym?
Ah-ah, let's be clear.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.284
I never suggested
that I become king,

27:46.330 --> 27:49.128
only that someone should.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.991
It's an opinion that is...

27:51.030 --> 27:53.863
not very socially acceptable
at the moment.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.039
One day. (chuckles)

27:56.070 --> 27:57.901
Well, how are you
in such high spirits

27:57.940 --> 28:00.135
with modernity and progressivism
eroding the natural order?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.479
Do you have some
fresh reason for optimism?

28:02.510 --> 28:04.398
Of course.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.202
The two of you.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.741
The truth draws
talented people

28:08.780 --> 28:11.749
like moths to a flame,
more every day.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.041
Acolytes.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.978
Is that what you'd call us?

28:15.020 --> 28:17.409
You're... kindred spirits.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.452
"There will be no end

28:21.500 --> 28:25.391
"to the troubles of humanity
until philosophers

28:25.430 --> 28:28.991
become kings."
Actually, we're not acolytes,
we're detectives.

28:30.140 --> 28:31.960
And I'm with Churchill,
I'm afraid.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.001
"Democracy is the worst form
of government,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.769
except for all the others."

28:35.810 --> 28:37.300
WATSON:
We were wondering
where you were

28:37.340 --> 28:39.479
three nights ago,
around 9:00 pm.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.783
This is about what happened
in Gail's lab.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.811
There's evidence that suggests

28:45.850 --> 28:47.852
that you wanted
to use her algorithm

28:47.890 --> 28:49.118
to push your ideas online.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.851
I was here.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.950
I was hosting a seminar
on Thomas Carlyle.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.164
It started at 7:00
and ended at 10:00.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.909
There are over a dozen witnesses
who Will vouch for me.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.076
You know something,
Mr. Antonov.

29:08.110 --> 29:12.376
And Why would I help a tool
of a bloated and dying empire?

29:12.410 --> 29:15.208
Because you don't Wish to be
doxxed as a public servant?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.047
I mean, What would
your followers think

29:17.080 --> 29:19.810
if they realized you suckled
at government's teat?

29:21.960 --> 29:25.384
Look, you have the wrong idea.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.422
No one would have killed Gail
for that algorithm.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.428
It didn't work.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.938
And you know that how?
Well...

29:33.970 --> 29:37.189
she never changed
her password.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.209
I would... check
on her sometimes.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.778
We had 11 good years,
and I missed her.

29:46.310 --> 29:50.576
(sighs) Gail was disappointed
with the program, obviously,

29:50.620 --> 29:53.418
but... well,
she was nervous, too.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.556
She wasn't sure at all
how her patron would take it.

29:56.590 --> 29:58.922
What patron?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.996
A man named Samuel Meher.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.429
He works at DARPA.

30:02.460 --> 30:04.462
He... put his neck on the line

30:04.500 --> 30:06.092
to fund the
whole project.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.291
He was very intense.

30:08.340 --> 30:12.231
I didn't like the way
he talked to her in e-mails.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.101
I would have
said something...

30:14.140 --> 30:17.974
If it hadn't meant admitting
to cyber-stalking your ex.

30:18.010 --> 30:21.013
I never would have hurt her.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.078
HOLMES:
Yeah.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.519
Good luck overthrowing
the government.

30:24.550 --> 30:26.108
Don't put us against the wall

30:26.150 --> 30:28.152
when you get those
firing squads going, will you?

30:30.660 --> 30:32.981
You buy Meher
as a suspect?

30:33.030 --> 30:34.998
Well, he's ex-military;
he's capable.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.998
It's worth checking
Sarkisian's e-mails

30:37.030 --> 30:38.998
for his intimidating comments.

30:39.030 --> 30:41.260
Would you mind running
his name at the FBI?

30:41.300 --> 30:43.268
And if they ask
why I'm looking?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.302
Oh, tell them it was ordained
by the architect

30:45.340 --> 30:47.035
of a techno-feudal monarchy.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.474
Are you looking
into Samuel Meher?

30:53.580 --> 30:55.468
Oh, you get copied
on my searches?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.476
All guest log-ins
are monitored.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.886
Got to be able to_ account
for your actIVIty.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.979
I didn't...
I didn't even know

31:02.020 --> 31:03.487
you were coming
into the office today.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.078
So... What's up?

31:05.130 --> 31:06.950
Well, Sarkisian and Weller
reported to Meher.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.548
He was their champion.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.398
I just wanted to make sure
their relationship
was a good one.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.068
And What about this stuff?

31:13.100 --> 31:15.091
Sonic-pressure shields.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.409
Robotic dogs.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.260
Nanotechnology.
Yeah, these are other projects

31:20.310 --> 31:22.198
_that Weller _
was administering funding for,

31:24.310 --> 31:27.074
I was just wondering
who else had access.

31:27.110 --> 31:29.544
Just keep me in the loop
next time, okay?

31:29.580 --> 31:32.048
Sure.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.957
What's a mansion
got to do With Meher?

31:34.990 --> 31:36.981
Oh, this is something else
for another case.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.581
Well, I know
what consultants make, Joan,

31:40.630 --> 31:43.121
so if you're looking
for a new place,

31:43.160 --> 31:45.299
might want to lower your aim.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.667
(teakettle Whistling)

31:51.710 --> 31:53.268
(door closes)

31:53.310 --> 31:55.574
How did you fare
at the FBI?

31:55.610 --> 31:57.100
(sighs) Not well.

31:57.140 --> 31:59.608
I did not find anything
in Samuel Meher's background

31:59.650 --> 32:02.073
that would suggest
he would kill three people

32:02.120 --> 32:05.544
to cover up a botched project.
Mm. Well, I'm
hardly surprised.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.649
I'm beginning to sour on him
as a suspect myself.

32:07.690 --> 32:10.079
Why is that?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.678
Well, aside from the victims...

32:11.730 --> 32:14.221
no one suffered _
a worse result from the crime.

32:14.260 --> 32:17.195
I'm sure Mr. Meher
would reject the old adage

32:17.230 --> 32:20.267
that there's no such thing
as bad publicity, hmm?

32:24.710 --> 32:28.077
So, a secret brainwashing
program that everyone thinks

32:28.110 --> 32:30.704
has fallen into the hands
of the Chinese.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.278
I'd say this qualifies
as a PR nightmare.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.339
Is that Tienchi Flower tea?

32:38.390 --> 32:40.540
Mm. It was on my mind today.

32:40.590 --> 32:42.251
Amongst other things.

32:44.260 --> 32:47.127
I've decided to take Father up
on his offer.

32:48.730 --> 32:50.391
I don't think
he's entirely correct

32:50.430 --> 32:53.399
that the department is essential
to my "support system."

32:53.430 --> 32:57.594
Our work certainly hasn't been
a boon to my well-being of late.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.302
But there are
other considerations.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.142
I believe
it would make me happy.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.648
That matters.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.342
You're not worried
about the cost?

33:10.380 --> 33:13.019
One could argue
it was paid long ago.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.608
What does that mean?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.616
If I've learned one thing
over the last

33:16.660 --> 33:20.027
couple of years, it's the
importance of making amends.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.051
Sometimes they should
also be accepted.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.498
Well, if it's
all right With you,

33:26.530 --> 33:28.691
I think I need
a little more time.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.696
Of course.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.514
Two op-eds calling for
Samuel Meher's dismissal.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.347
If he was behind the murders

33:44.390 --> 33:46.381
it was the ultimate act
of self-sabotage.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.353
You know, just because
an algorithm

33:51.390 --> 33:53.221
can't sway public opinion,
doesn't mean

33:53.260 --> 33:54.693
a good, old-fashioned
scandal can't.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.528
Maybe we should look for someone

33:57.560 --> 34:00.165
who did benefit from all this.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.567
When we get back, let's send
those specs over to Gilchrist.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.309
I've... uh... just...

34:07.340 --> 34:08.432
Hi.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.277
You're the
consultants, right?

34:10.310 --> 34:12.346
The ones working
with Agent Burke?

34:12.380 --> 34:13.404
Samuel Meher
said that you were back

34:13.450 --> 34:14.815
in town to meet
with Senator Shapiro.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.239
That's right.
HOLMES: I imagine you'll be

34:17.280 --> 34:18.645
meeting with every member
of the Armed Services Committee

34:18.690 --> 34:22.319
that approves
presidential appointees.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.351
Now the head of your agency
is retiring.

34:24.390 --> 34:26.426
Now that Mr. Meher's career
is in the tank,

34:26.460 --> 34:28.291
you're the heir apparent.

34:28.330 --> 34:29.752
It's a possibility.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.360
It's-it's also, uh, motive.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.335
Three murders, theft of some
top secret research...

34:35.370 --> 34:37.634
I mean, it's a big move,
but you would need one

34:37.670 --> 34:39.638
to leapfrog Meher
on the org chart.

34:39.670 --> 34:42.332
In a few months you're going
to be controlling the strings

34:42.380 --> 34:44.769
to DARPA's $2.8 billion budget.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.301
I don't have _a clue
what you're talking about.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.477
"Dan Zheng,
a suspect first identified

34:49.520 --> 34:51.784
by the New Jersey
Dispatch."

34:51.820 --> 34:54.357
Now, they don't break a lot
of national news in Trenton,

34:54.390 --> 34:55.857
but this was the paper

34:55.890 --> 34:57.312
you trusted your
scoop with because

34:57.360 --> 35:00.158
you went to college
with their managing editor.

35:00.190 --> 35:01.498
Given the First and Fifth
Amendments, it's unlikely

35:01.530 --> 35:02.690
that you would ever be outed

35:02.730 --> 35:04.368
as the source
of the leak,

35:04.400 --> 35:06.265
but who else makes sense?

35:06.300 --> 35:07.892
You didn't know
anything about Dan Zheng

35:07.930 --> 35:09.431
when you committed
the murders.

35:09.470 --> 35:11.904
But when he became a suspect,
you took advantage.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.601
You heard the FBI was
gonna be looking for him

35:13.640 --> 35:15.403
around Columbus Circle,

35:15.440 --> 35:17.738
so you dumped the stolen
computers right in their path.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.748
So I'm not
just the leak, then.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.873
I drove up from DC
in the dead of night

35:21.920 --> 35:24.411
and killed three people,
like some kind of super spy?

35:24.450 --> 35:25.747
No. You had an accomplice.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.382
It was her.
(chuckles)

35:27.420 --> 35:29.411
I'll tell you What.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.623
Uh, you can look anywhere
you want for my accomplice.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.389
I'll turn over _
my phone records, my e-mail,

35:34.430 --> 35:36.159
my bank statements--
anything you want.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.599
It's all gonna be picked through
when I get

35:37.630 --> 35:38.927
confirmed to run the agency,
anyway.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.369
You can be the first to vet me.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.407
(sighs) Well, that's it.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.803
That's the last of it.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.477
Every piece
of personal correspondence

35:54.520 --> 35:55.942
and financial data.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.345
Every last phone
record and e-mail that

35:57.380 --> 35:58.847
Alta Von See surrendered
to the FBI.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.949
I have examined

36:00.990 --> 36:03.618
all of it_and I have not been
able to discover her accomplice

36:03.660 --> 36:06.823
or even the slightest whiff
of impropriety.
Ugh. So that

36:06.860 --> 36:08.896
_ rancid smell
isn't impropriety?

36:08.930 --> 36:10.659
It's hkarl.

36:10.700 --> 36:13.225
Fermented Icelandic shark meat.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.532
Brain food. It's...

36:14.570 --> 36:16.231
a shock to the senses.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.238
I thawed some out
after you fell asleep.

36:18.270 --> 36:20.238
I needed something to...

36:20.270 --> 36:22.409
dredge us out of this funk.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.341
That stuff is contributing
to the funk, trust me.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.701
Oh, come on.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.411
Burke _was clear_about
returning the eVIdence

36:29.450 --> 36:31.247
in the same condition
we got it in.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.884
Yes, heaven forfend
that the law enforcement unit

36:33.920 --> 36:35.558
designated Burke, Agent Gary

36:35.590 --> 36:37.387
would get
his papers back stained.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.888
His operating system
might shut down.

36:39.930 --> 36:41.921
The FBI aren't robots.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.723
You're just upset
because we got a lecture

36:43.760 --> 36:46.399
for talking to Alta Von See
without him.

36:46.430 --> 36:47.692
You sure he's not a machine

36:47.730 --> 36:49.459
programmed to follow
Bureau protocol?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.536
I'm sure DARPA has one
in the works, along with

36:51.570 --> 36:53.561
a panoply of mechanical dogs,

36:53.610 --> 36:55.271
sonic pressure shields,

36:55.310 --> 36:57.574
cargo transport blimp...

36:58.950 --> 37:00.941
What is it?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.779
I think I may have discovered
Alta Von See's accomplice.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.481
There's only way
to know for sure.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.385
When _is the last time
you dissected a rat?

37:12.860 --> 37:15.351
Alta, you are not
a swift woman,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.992
you are not
fleet of foot.

37:17.030 --> 37:20.363
I'll admit I did not think
you capable of this crime.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.628
I should not have
discriminated.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.989
You are very clever.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.905
We did you a favor
coming all the way

37:24.940 --> 37:26.999
out here for whatever
the hell this is.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.009
You're not gonna let this man
insult my client.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.804
Clever is a compliment,
counselor.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.511
You want insults, just wait.

37:34.550 --> 37:37.519
You'll be hearing
"triple murderer" in a minute.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.381
That is What I'm implying,
Ms. Von See.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.682
That without _
any particular skill

37:40.720 --> 37:42.381
or training with firearms,

37:42.420 --> 37:44.354
you were able to create
a bloodbath here

37:44.390 --> 37:46.028
that would look like
the work of a professional.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.721
You did this yourself.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.558
I know you said there'd be
no reason for me to talk,

37:50.600 --> 37:53.489
but do you mind if I say
thatsinsane?
You seemed awfully bold,

37:53.530 --> 37:55.691
volunteering all of your bank
and phone records.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.059
We assumed
we'd find the person

37:57.100 --> 37:58.499
who helped you
execute your plan.

37:58.540 --> 38:00.667
HOLMES: Not to mention
three innocent people.

38:00.710 --> 38:04.271
The problem was we were looking
for a person, not a device.

38:10.950 --> 38:12.383
What is that?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.456
Do you want to explain
or shall I?

38:15.660 --> 38:19.084
This is a sonic pressure shield.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.325
It is a truly ingenious--
albeit fascist--

38:21.360 --> 38:23.453
piece of technology.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.593
The DARPA-funded scientists
across the hall

38:25.630 --> 38:27.791
have been developing it
as a crowd-control device.

38:27.830 --> 38:31.095
It emits a direct blast
of low-range

38:31.140 --> 38:34.632
sonic waves which vibrate_at the
same frequency as lung tissue.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.977
would you like a demonstration?

38:36.010 --> 38:37.477
WATSON:
The idea is for police

38:37.510 --> 38:39.774
to use it on unruly protesters.

38:39.810 --> 38:42.017
To disrupt their breathing
and incapacitate them.

38:42.050 --> 38:43.472
You used it to turn

38:43.520 --> 38:45.681
Gail Sarkisian, Frank Weller
and Ollie Tate

38:45.720 --> 38:48.018
into sitting ducks.
By the time
you entered the room,

38:48.050 --> 38:49.381
your targets were essentially

38:49.420 --> 38:50.785
out on their feet, suffocating.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.959
You could approach them
at your own speed

38:52.990 --> 38:54.855
and then shoot them,
point blank, Without risk

38:54.900 --> 38:56.959
of being overpowered.
This is crazy.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.389
You don't have any proof.
WATSON: Actually,
that's not true.

38:59.430 --> 39:01.489
The shield's power
may be invisible,

39:01.540 --> 39:02.495
but its effects
are not.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.405
You shot your
three victims

39:04.440 --> 39:06.704
before their lungs
could be damaged badly enough

39:06.740 --> 39:09.470
to show up in an autopsy.
But there was a fourth victim.

39:10.610 --> 39:12.578
Frank Weller's pet lab rat.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.747
As you can see,
the otherwise healthy rodent

39:19.790 --> 39:21.587
has perished from asphyxiation.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.087
I personally don't know
what I'm looking at

39:23.120 --> 39:26.624
but even if I did, Who's to say
Ms. Von See did this?

39:26.660 --> 39:28.059
I'll say it.

39:28.090 --> 39:30.957
We found traces of blood
at the bottom of the shield,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.661
so we know it was used.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.736
And there was an odd streak
on the baseboard

39:34.770 --> 39:36.590
in the closet across the hall,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.665
where the shield
is stored.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.599
Black rubber.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.107
This...

39:43.140 --> 39:45.904
compels you to hand
over your crutch,

39:45.950 --> 39:48.646
so we can test the rubber tip
for a match.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.648
If it does...
Good luck explaining

39:50.680 --> 39:52.944
why you were locked in a closet
with a bloody murder weapon.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.811
You know, it could be worse.
Imagine how embarrassing

39:55.860 --> 39:57.088
this would all be
if it had come out

39:57.120 --> 39:58.155
during your confirmation
heanng.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.495
(tapping on glass door)

40:02.530 --> 40:03.952
ASSISTANT:
Sorry to interrupt.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.524
Ms. Watson is here to see you.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.662
She wasn't on the schedule.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.962
It's all right, Jessica.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.491
Please take a seat.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.007
I'm fine, thank you.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.634
Did you misplace my number?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.636
Some things are better
to discuss in person.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.171
Like violating
campaign finance laws,

40:19.210 --> 40:22.668
bribing elected officials,
that sort of thing.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.540
Sherlock didn't say much
about you over the years,

40:24.590 --> 40:25.648
but he said enough.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.487
I didn't think
I should trust you.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.159
So I didn't.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.681
I think you'll recognize this.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.849
It's a small estate

40:36.900 --> 40:39.198
in Southampton I used to own.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.118
Up until very recently.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.035
You sold it a few days
after Sherlock relapsed.

40:43.070 --> 40:44.560
That's right.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.702
The price jumped out a me.

40:45.740 --> 40:48.163
Three million
below market value.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.974
It's not
a great deal for you.

40:51.010 --> 40:53.706
I don't know that
it's as bad as you think.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.218
No. Probably not.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.514
Not when you consider
that same lucky home buyer

40:58.550 --> 40:59.983
did you a big favor.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.818
He funded a super PAC that
supports the district attorney.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.727
And just like that,
Sherlock is no longer

41:05.760 --> 41:08.649
facing criminal charges
against Oscar Rankin.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.666
Would you like a drink, Joan?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.695
No, thanks.

41:17.540 --> 41:21.260
I don't know
what to tell you.

41:21.310 --> 41:23.938
There are things that money
can't buy,

41:23.980 --> 41:27.541
but fewer, perhaps,
than you'd like to believe.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.646
I'm curious.

41:33.650 --> 41:36.118
Why kick over rocks
if you really don't

41:36.160 --> 41:37.650
want to know
what's beneath them?

41:39.660 --> 41:41.287
I take it you're here alone

41:41.330 --> 41:42.695
because you haven't
told Sherlock.

41:42.730 --> 41:43.958
No, I haven't.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.820
I hope you have the good sense

41:45.870 --> 41:47.690
to keep it that way.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.539
My son was born

41:49.570 --> 41:53.939
with a malignant sense
of self-righteousness.

41:53.970 --> 41:57.098
I have little doubt that he
would expose the arrangement,

41:57.140 --> 41:59.540
probably land himself
in prison just to spite me.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.309
Be back where he was
a few days ago:

42:01.350 --> 42:05.787
adrift, uncertain, at risk.

42:05.820 --> 42:09.756
You took quite a risk yourself.

42:09.790 --> 42:12.179
I've always been Willing to go
to lengths to protect Sherlock.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.754
So have I.

42:13.790 --> 42:15.690
You should keep that in mind,
because Sherlock

42:15.730 --> 42:18.290
is gonna call you tonight
and he's gonna accept your help.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.064
He wants to go back to the NYPD.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.192
I'm gonna go with him.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.208
That's good news.

42:25.240 --> 42:28.937
I can't imagine why you would
deliver it as a threat.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.642
Doesn't have to be.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.898
But if you're gonna be a part
of Sherlock's life again,

42:33.950 --> 42:36.646
I want to make one thing clear.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.887
I'm not gonna let you hurt him.
