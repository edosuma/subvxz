 NARRATOR: On this episode
 of "Mythbusters,"

 and then get blind drunk...

 Over.

 NARRATOR:... as they test

 from Hollywood.

00:21.921 --> 00:22.855
 [ Laughs ]

00:22.856 --> 00:25.856
 NARRATOR: Can a blind person
 really drive without crashing?

00:25.925 --> 00:28.925
 We've got an actual blind person
 driving a car.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.930
 NARRATOR:
 Then Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:31.931 --> 00:34.733

 at a golf trilogy.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.268
 Oh!

00:36.269 --> 00:39.269
 NARRATOR: Can your shoes turn
 you into a lightning magnet?

00:40.940 --> 00:43.809
 Is a tree really
 an impenetrable obstacle?

00:43.810 --> 00:45.177
 Fire at will!

 NARRATOR:
 And, ÃƒÂ  la "Caddyshack"...

 Okay, you want to play rough,
 little gopher?

00:49.315 --> 00:52.315
 NARRATOR:... can an underground
 explosion really sink a putt?

 Boom, boom.

 NARRATOR:
 Who are the Mythbusters?

01:01.461 --> 01:02.694
 Adam Savage...

 I can't believe
 that this is my job.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.686
 NARRATOR:
 They don't just tell the myths.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.687
 They put them to the test.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.665
 Fasten your seat belts because
 blind driving peels out first.

 [ Imitates car engine ]

 [ Imitates tires screeching ]

01:51.511 --> 01:52.711
 What are you doing?

01:52.712 --> 01:54.213
 I'm driving blind.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.047
 Why?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.483
 'Cause it's our next myth.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.852
 Oh, you mean like
 in the "Scent of a Woman"?

01:59.853 --> 02:02.853
 It's like you're freakin'
 psychic. That's awesome.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.324
 Yes, where Al Pacino's
 character, who is blind,

02:05.325 --> 02:07.526
 is able to drive a sports car

02:07.527 --> 02:09.428
 by being given instructions
 from his passenger.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.829
 That's what we're gonna test.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.830
 -Hoo-ah!
 -[ Laughs ]

02:14.267 --> 02:16.168
 NARRATOR:
 In "Scent of a Woman,"

02:16.169 --> 02:19.169
 a blind driver takes a sports
 car for a high-speed spin.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.473
 By responding
 to turn-by-turn instructions

02:23.643 --> 02:26.211
 from his terrified
 sighted passenger,

02:26.212 --> 02:28.714
 they pull off
 the seemingly impossible.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.816
 Here I go.
 Here I go!

02:30.817 --> 02:32.151
 Ready? Now!

02:32.152 --> 02:35.152
 NARRATOR: But can such teamwork
 really work?

02:38.091 --> 02:39.591
 I did it!

02:39.592 --> 02:42.592
 Oh, Charlie!

02:43.329 --> 02:44.897
 I assume you have a plan.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.365
 I do,
 and it's a pretty simple one.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.200
 I figure
 we need a blindfold, a car,

02:48.201 --> 02:51.069
 and [chuckles]
 a closed course to drive on.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.705
 I'll put on the blindfold
 and go wherever you tell me.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.008
 -And can we take turns?
 -Absolutely.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.443
 I think it's imperative
 that we both have a crack at it.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.511
 [ Horn honks ]

02:59.512 --> 03:01.013
 NARRATOR:
 So, let's get cracking.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.014
 To try to re-create this highly
 hazardous driving technique

03:04.584 --> 03:05.651
 in the real world,

03:05.652 --> 03:08.353
 the guys are using
 a pedestrian-free zone.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.989
 ADAM: The lovely people
 at the Alameda County Sheriff's

03:10.990 --> 03:12.691
 Emergency-Vehicle
 Operation Center

03:12.692 --> 03:14.893
 have lent us
 their driving course.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.596
 It is a blank slate.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.565
 I'm gonna set up
 a whole bunch of cones

03:19.566 --> 03:22.566
 that will create our
 city streets for blind driving.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.804
 NARRATOR: Jamie is going
 to play the blind driver first,

03:25.805 --> 03:27.839
 so Adam sets up
 the course alone.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.442
 This means
 that the mustachioed maestro

03:30.443 --> 03:33.443
 won't have the advantage
 of knowing its twists and turns.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.315
 In setting up the course
 for our blind driver,

03:36.316 --> 03:38.116
 I've tried to add
 all the obstacles

03:38.117 --> 03:39.151
 that we see in the movie.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.919
 So I'm starting out with a nice,

03:40.920 --> 03:43.920
 long get-your-bearings
 kind of straightaway.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.990
 That also includes
 a sharp left-hand turn.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.560
 Right after that, I've got
 a second sharp left-hand turn.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.398
 [ Chuckles ] And...

03:53.399 --> 03:56.399
 I've included an obstacle
 for Jamie to swerve around.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.037
 This ought to be
 all the challenges

03:59.038 --> 04:01.540
 we need for our blind driver.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.809
 NARRATOR:
 And that just leaves the car,

04:03.810 --> 04:06.810
 which, for this test, comes
 complete with in-car cameras,

04:06.913 --> 04:09.414
 a driving instructor
 called Derek,

04:09.415 --> 04:11.783
 and a crucial safety feature.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.086
 JAMIE: This car is specially
 rigged with controls

04:14.087 --> 04:16.688
 so that he can hit
 his own set of brakes

04:16.689 --> 04:19.257
 and stop the car
 in case I get frisky on him.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.524
 That's gonna be tricky.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.160
 Are you feeling ready, champ?

04:22.161 --> 04:24.529
 Yeah, let's do it.

04:24.530 --> 04:25.797
 NARRATOR:
 Just like in the movie,

04:25.798 --> 04:28.200
 Jamie will be totally
 in the dark,

04:28.201 --> 04:31.201
 relying solely
 on Adam's directions.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.508
 ADAM: All right, Jamie, go
 forward, just get your bearings.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.310
 A little bit to the left.
 A little bit to the left.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.244
 That's good.

04:39.245 --> 04:42.080
 NARRATOR: Cruising at an easy
 pace down the straightaway,

04:42.081 --> 04:44.283
 they come to their first bend
 in the road.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.052
 Okay, there's a turn
 coming up to the left.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.086
 Excellent.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.022

 Made it with no cones down.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.456
 Straighten it out.
 Straighten it out.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.392
 Okay, pick up the speed.
 Let's pick up the speed.

 But not for long.

 to the right.

 To the right, to the right.
 More to the right.

 into a game of cone Pac-Man.

 More to the right. To the left,
 to the left! Hard to the left.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.842

05:12.745 --> 05:14.813
 We need a new navigator.
 [ Chuckles ]

05:14.814 --> 05:17.783
 NARRATOR: Like a couple
 of out-of-sync co-drivers,

05:17.784 --> 05:19.284
 Adam blamed Jamie.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.987
 His ability to correct
 on the fly on the straightaways

05:21.988 --> 05:24.756
 was pretty poor, even up to
 and including his ability

05:24.757 --> 05:26.758
 to know left from right
 at times.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.827
 NARRATOR:
 And Jamie blamed Adam.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.896
 JAMIE:
 You know, "More, more, more"

05:30.897 --> 05:33.098
 is like "What, what, what?"

05:33.099 --> 05:34.933
 It's easy to get confused

05:34.934 --> 05:37.602
 or not do something enough
 or too little.

05:37.603 --> 05:40.572
 NARRATOR: If the guys
 don't begin to work as one,

05:40.573 --> 05:42.941
 they're finished,
 finished, finished.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.942
 [ Laughs ]

05:51.784 --> 05:54.386
 Fore!

05:54.387 --> 05:56.088
 So, Grant, what's with
 the sweater? Did you retire?

05:56.089 --> 05:58.023
 No, I'm not retiring yet.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.024
 I'm merely appropriately dressed
 for our next series of myths.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.160
 Is the next series of myths
 about fashion disasters?

06:04.664 --> 06:05.430
 No.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.833
 With over 60 million golfers
 around the world,

06:07.834 --> 06:10.535
 it's no surprise that
 the website has been inundated

06:10.536 --> 06:12.804
 with requests
 to do myths about golf.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.805
 The first one
 is that a tree is 90 % air.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.776
 Yeah, I've heard that one,
 and a lot of golfers say

06:17.777 --> 06:19.211
 if your ball
 gets stuck behind a tree,

06:19.212 --> 06:20.679
 instead of shooting
 around the tree,

06:20.680 --> 06:22.180
 it's better
 to shoot through it

06:22.181 --> 06:24.249
 because you have a 90 % chance
 of getting through it

06:24.250 --> 06:25.951
 because it's 90 % air.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.453
 Great. So all we need
 is a bucket of balls,

06:28.454 --> 06:30.856
 some golf clubs,
 camp out behind a tree,

06:30.857 --> 06:33.158
 see how many we hit through.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.426
 Sounds good to me.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.595
 NARRATOR: From a distance,
 a tree may look like

06:36.596 --> 06:38.630
 a solid, impenetrable object.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.066
 But up close,
 there's a huge amount of space

06:41.067 --> 06:42.734
 between its leaves.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.735
 So huge that some golfers think
 you have a 90 % chance

06:47.240 --> 06:50.240
 of swinging clean through.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.512
 To find out
 if this myth is all hot air,

06:53.513 --> 06:55.213
 Team Tee Off travels

06:55.214 --> 06:58.214
 to one of the most famous
 golf courses in the world.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.153
 All right, let's do this.

07:01.154 --> 07:04.154
 I'm starting to feel
 a little underdressed.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.192
 TORY: Where better to come
 than world-famous Pebble Beach?

07:07.193 --> 07:09.428
 This is where Jack Nicklaus
 and Tiger Woods play.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.996
 And now they're gonna
 let us play?

07:10.997 --> 07:13.632
 NARRATOR: Yeah, I'm not sure
 they've seen the show.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.234
 But with a world-class
 golf course -- check --

07:16.235 --> 07:19.235
 some top-rate golf outfits --
 uh, check --

07:19.605 --> 07:22.605
 now the team just needs a tree.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.443
 And this should do.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.978
 TORY: The tree that we picked --
 it's a very average tree.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.979
 And it's the kind of tree that
 you would try to play through

07:30.016 --> 07:32.451
 'cause when you look at it, you
 see that there is enough light.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.786
 So you're thinking,
 "I could get through this

07:34.787 --> 07:36.822
 and actually play through
 to the next hole."

07:36.823 --> 07:38.990
 NARRATOR:
 So, what's the plan, Tiger?

07:38.991 --> 07:41.393
 So, to begin our initial
 research into this myth,

07:41.394 --> 07:44.394
 we're each going to hit
 10 golf balls into the tree

07:44.764 --> 07:46.298
 and see if we can
 make it through.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.299
 NARRATOR: And if 9 of those 10
 do sail through,

07:49.302 --> 07:51.069
 it's myth confirmed.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.238
 Having played golf
 since high school,

07:53.239 --> 07:55.106
 Tory is going to tee off first.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.908
 The bad thing is,
 I find myself

07:56.909 --> 07:59.778
 in this situation quite often
 when I'm playing golf.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.714
 NARRATOR:
 First shot went like a shot --

08:02.715 --> 08:04.449
 straight through the foliage.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.750
 -Look at that.
 -KARI: Nice one.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.751
 See? Normally, I would have
 to shoot out into the fairway.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.089
 -KARI: One for one.
 -I just cut the corner.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.090
 NARRATOR: But shot two
 stops dead in its tracks.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.128
 I'm gonna have to say that one
 didn't make it through the tree.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.431
 NARRATOR:
 So, it's one apiece after two.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.200
 And after a montage
 of the other eight balls,

08:22.201 --> 08:23.502
 what's the final score?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.704
 So far, the score
 is six made it through,

08:25.705 --> 08:27.572
 two went wacky,
 and two came back at us.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.573
 NARRATOR: In other words,
 for Tory, the tree was 60 % air.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.645
 Can Kari do any better?

08:33.645 --> 08:35.313
 -Sure you want to stand there?
 -No.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.948
 NARRATOR: Kari quickly learns
 that in golf,

08:37.950 --> 08:40.950
 no matter how bad
 your last shot was...

08:41.220 --> 08:43.321
 KARI: Oh!

08:43.322 --> 08:45.624
 NARRATOR:
...your worst is yet to come.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.726
 Ba-na-na-na-na-na!
 [ Laughs ]

08:47.727 --> 08:50.727
 NARRATOR: Of Kari's 10, only
 one ball went towards the tree,

08:52.131 --> 08:54.366
 and that was along the ground.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.068
 But she's still better
 than Grant.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.970
 Stee-rike one.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.939
 Yeah, Grant.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.108
 NARRATOR: In golfspeak,
 swinging and missing the ball

09:03.109 --> 09:05.744
 is known as a whiff.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.745
 So his aim positively stinks.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.915
 Maybe you should take up tennis.

09:12.785 --> 09:15.785
 NARRATOR: So far, our threesome
 has dug up plenty of dirt.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.857
 But nearing a conclusion,
 they ain't.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.625
 Okay, well,
 this was not very scientific.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.626
 Out of 30 balls, how many
 of them actually counted?

09:23.763 --> 09:24.896
 Yeah, not many.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.565
 We're gonna have to figure out
 a way to get these balls

09:26.566 --> 09:27.799
 to go at a consistent speed,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.768
 and we're gonna need to aim it
 at the tree,

09:29.769 --> 09:32.704
 so that way we get a good test.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.240

 Doing good.
 You're doing good.

 before things go bad.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.788
 Brake. Hard left.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.256
 Too hard.
 Straighten it out.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.458
 NARRATOR:
 If they were on a real street,

09:53.459 --> 09:55.961
 Adam would now be
 up over the sidewalk...

09:55.962 --> 09:58.597
 Hard left.
 Straighten it out. More.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.513
 DEREK:
 Every single one of them.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.115
 NARRATOR:
 The blind-driver theory

10:17.116 --> 10:19.851
 is looking like it's on the road
 to being busted.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.220
 But the guys
 did confirm one thing --

10:22.221 --> 10:24.990
 there's no "I" in team.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.091
 This is all about teamwork.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.393
 It's not about the driver
 or the navigator.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.462
 It's about how both of them
 are working together.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.831
 They really have to get in sync
 for this to work.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.433
 NARRATOR:
 So, shall we take it to the max?

10:35.434 --> 10:38.003
 -We really need a blind guy.
 -I totally agree.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.304
 No one will believe
 this is plausible

10:39.305 --> 10:42.305
 until we get an actual blind guy
 in the driver's seat.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.581
 NARRATOR: One of the most
 frustrating situations

10:49.582 --> 10:52.582
 you can get in in the sometimes
 infuriating game of golf

10:53.119 --> 10:55.854
 is getting stuck behind a tree.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.089
 To swing you
 out of the jungle...

10:58.090 --> 10:58.823
 Nice.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.759
 NARRATOR:... the team
 has been testing the myth

11:00.760 --> 11:02.227
 that when blocked by a tree,

11:02.228 --> 11:04.329
 you should try to shoot
 right through it.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.098
 I'm gonna have to say that one
 didn't make it through the tree.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.567
 NARRATOR: The theory is that,
 although a tree looks solid,

11:09.568 --> 11:11.936
 90 % of its volume is air,

11:11.937 --> 11:14.937
 meaning a ball will sail through
 90 % of the time.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.008
 But so far, their golfing skills
 have been so bad

11:19.712 --> 11:22.280
 that testing the myth
 has been impossible.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.783
 And that means
 they're gonna need a plan "B."

11:24.784 --> 11:25.784
 Oh!

11:25.785 --> 11:26.885
 I know, it's pretty obvious.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.319
 In order to test this properly,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.388
 we're gonna have to take
 ourselves out of the equation,

11:30.389 --> 11:32.457
 -which means only one thing.
 -We're getting Tiger Woods?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.626
 No, better!
 We're gonna build a robot!

11:34.627 --> 11:35.160
 Mm.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.328
 We're gonna build a machine
 that fires balls

11:37.329 --> 11:40.265
 at the same speed and angle
 as a professional golfer.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.068
 Then we shoot a really big
 sample size, like 100 balls,

11:43.069 --> 11:45.904
 and see if they go through
 the tree 90 % of the time.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.906
 What is it with you
 and these robots?

11:47.907 --> 11:49.374
 NARRATOR:
 Using compressed air,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.276
 Grant hopes to shoot balls
 through the barrel

11:51.277 --> 11:54.277
 at the same velocity
 as a proficient human golfer.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.147
 And that's something
 they figured out earlier.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.385
 Before they left Pebble Beach,

12:00.386 --> 12:02.921
 the team met pro golfer
 Laird Small

12:02.922 --> 12:05.223
 to precisely analyze his swing.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.391
 -How you doing? I'm Tory.
 -Tory.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.727
 Welcome to Spyglass Hill in
 Pebble Beach. Glad you're here.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.528
 NARRATOR:
 Using the high-speed camera,

12:10.529 --> 12:12.831
 they determined
 that when ball leaves club,

12:12.832 --> 12:15.832
 it does so
 at around 150 miles an hour.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.070
 So that's what Grant's
 aiming for.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.072
 He makes it look so easy.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.073
 Well, he is the pro.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.644
 GRANT: We don't want it
 to be superhuman

12:26.645 --> 12:29.645
 to give it some advantage
 at getting through the tree.

 Time to test its oomph.

 Here we go.
 In 3, 2, 1.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.291
 NARRATOR:
...and what do you know?

12:40.292 --> 12:43.061
 The ball shot out
 at 150 miles per hour,

12:43.062 --> 12:45.363
 just like the real deal.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.333
 Now we know how to make
 foam cylinders.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.868
 NARRATOR:
 Armed with their machine

12:49.869 --> 12:51.703
 and a serious amount of balls,

12:51.704 --> 12:53.538

 heads back to the course

12:53.539 --> 12:56.539
 for the 90 %-Air Invitational.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.177
 KARI:
 We want to see how the tree

12:59.178 --> 13:00.278
 affects the distance
 of the ball,

13:00.279 --> 13:03.279
 so we're going to shoot 100
 balls without a tree in the way

13:03.449 --> 13:05.083
 and 100 balls
 with the tree in the way

13:05.084 --> 13:06.584

 skips years of aggravation

 the complexities

 of the backswing, downswing,
 and follow-through.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.548
 Without the tree
 impeding their flight,

13:36.549 --> 13:39.549
 most of the yellow balls
 landed 500 feet away.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.753
 Now to see how far they go
 with the tree in the way.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.491
 This time,
 they're using pink balls.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.492
 So, for this myth, which is
 that the tree is 90 % air,

13:50.796 --> 13:53.796
 what we'll be looking for
 is 90 of the pink balls

13:54.600 --> 13:57.468
 will be at the same distance
 as the yellow balls.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.070

 But there's a twist.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.906
 Having assessed his competition
 from the sidelines,

14:01.907 --> 14:04.907
 Tory is also going to pit
 himself against Grant's robot

14:06.045 --> 14:07.445
 using blue balls.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.013
 So, what are his chances?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.316
 Come on, it's Grant's robot.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.884
 It's got consistency.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.953
 He can make that exact.

 I don't really think
 that Tory has a chance.

 to find out.

 into the tree.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.240
 But how many
 will sail clean through?

14:37.443 --> 14:40.443
 Will it be the 90 %
 that this myth needs?

 Now to tally up who won --

14:45.684 --> 14:48.684
 Tory, the machine, or the tree.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.589
 By counting
 the pink and blue balls

14:51.590 --> 14:53.691
 that made it into the same range
 as the yellow,

14:53.692 --> 14:55.793
 they can calculate
 the percentage

14:55.794 --> 14:58.096
 that were unimpeded by the tree.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.397
 27.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.165
 27 balls made it
 through the tree.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.767
 So 27 %.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.869
 -24 % on the pink.
 -Wow.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.870
 So, about --

15:05.871 --> 15:08.740
 Well, that's about a quarter
 of the balls made it through.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.909
 That's not 90 % air right there.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.543
 No, it's not.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.013

 a low percentage of balls

15:15.014 --> 15:16.481
 making it through the tree,

15:16.482 --> 15:19.482
 for proponents of the myth,
 Kari's got some bad news.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.253
 Now, the myth says
 that the tree is 90 % air.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.821
 That should be 90 % of the balls.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.723
 That was only 25 % of the balls.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.258
 That means this myth is busted.

 but I beat the machine.

 NARRATOR: Having already taken
 this theory for a test-drive,

15:41.106 --> 15:44.106
 they set a new standard
 in reckless driving.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.945
 Now they're shifting it
 into high gear.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.280
 We realized that's not enough.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.250
 We need an actual blind person
 behind the wheel of the car.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.052
 And more than that,
 we need to raise the stakes.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.955
 A closed course isn't good
 enough. We need city streets.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.857
 NARRATOR: Safely away
 from inhabited neighborhoods,

15:59.858 --> 16:02.858
 the site for their trial
 is an abandoned military base.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.497
 This location is amazing.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.498
 They are residential streets,
 and they're totally abandoned.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.071
 And I got to tell you,
 it's creepy as heck.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.072
 It really is postapocalyptic,
 and I'm expecting a zombie horde

16:17.343 --> 16:20.343
 to come crawling out
 of a basement at any moment.

16:20.412 --> 16:23.281
 Nice view.
 Just like home.

 they found the ideal location,

 -Hi, Jerry.
 -Jamie, howdy.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.725
 -Glad to meet you.
 -Hey, man, good to meet you.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.726
 So, you're here to do a little
 driving for us, I understand.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.663
 I certainly am.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.199
 Well, there are different
 kinds of blindness.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.334
 There's legally blind,
 as per the definition,

16:43.335 --> 16:45.737
 and then there's
 "can't see a darn thing" blind.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.739
 -What are you?
 -No light, no nothing.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.774
 That's perfect.
 Are you ready to drive?

 Hoo-yah!

16:51.010 --> 16:52.443
 [ Both laugh ]

16:52.444 --> 16:55.444
 NARRATOR: Jerry is one
 gutsy guy, and he needs to be,

16:55.581 --> 16:57.648
 because his route
 through the burbs

16:57.649 --> 16:59.851
 is full of twists and turns.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.487
 We start out
 with a nice straightaway,

17:02.488 --> 17:05.455
 easing into a little bit
 of a curve,

17:05.457 --> 17:08.457
 then a hard right-hand turn,

17:08.694 --> 17:11.694
 and an obstacle
 just like yesterday.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.165
 But we're not done.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.867
 One more right-hand turn
 before we get home,

17:16.868 --> 17:19.868
 and we've got to finish off
 by parking in the driveway.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.140
 That's our course.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.809
 It's the blind
 leading the bald now, isn't it?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.277
 -Yeah.
 -Oh, very funny.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.278
 You have fun now.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.957
 Up next, we have
 a real shocker of a myth.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.393
 That's right. This one involves
 thunderbolts and lighting.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.961
 Very, very frightening.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.663
 Now, the myth is that

17:45.664 --> 17:48.399
 if you're playing a round
 of golf in a thunderstorm

17:48.400 --> 17:50.234
 and you're wearing metal cleats,

17:50.235 --> 17:52.670
 you're more likely
 to get hit by lightning.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.305
 KARI: We know playing golf
 in a thunderstorm

17:54.306 --> 17:55.840
 is seriously dangerous,

17:55.841 --> 17:58.709
 but this myth is not about
 holding a club in the air

17:58.710 --> 17:59.844
 or a golf umbrella.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.846
 That's obviously a bad idea.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.714
 This is about
 whether the metal cleats

18:03.715 --> 18:06.715
 in the bottom of your shoes
 actually attract the lightning.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.120
 NARRATOR:
 This myth isn't out of thin air.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.856
 Golfers are sometimes
 struck by lightning

18:11.857 --> 18:14.857
 because it's attracted to their
 highly conductive metal clubs.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.862
 But could metal cleats
 on their shoes

18:17.863 --> 18:20.863
 also be enough to attract
 a bolt from the blue?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.768
 All right, well, this myth
 is a little problematic.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.070
 First of all, not many lightning
 storms this time of year.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.606
 And secondly, it's just
 too dangerous to film in one.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.408
 Yeah, and the chances are
 the camera crew

18:30.409 --> 18:31.576
 would be the first to get hit.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.011
 And we don't want that
 to happen, do we?

18:34.012 --> 18:35.246
 GRANT: Agreed.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.614
 So, to keep all of us safe,

18:36.615 --> 18:38.683
 let's build
 two ballistics-gel dummies

18:38.684 --> 18:40.918
 with the same electrical
 resistance as a person.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.087
 We'll put regular plastic cleats
 on one

18:43.088 --> 18:44.622
 and metal cleats on the other

18:44.623 --> 18:46.290
 and see which gets hit
 by lightning.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.559
 Well, for the lightning, we
 should go to an electric company

18:48.560 --> 18:49.894
 that has a test facility.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.429
 This way, we have
 a controlled environment.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.631
 We can put our ballistic golfers
 wherever we want them,

18:53.632 --> 18:54.966
 and then we can see
 if we can fry them

18:54.967 --> 18:56.200
 with one of these
 lightning bolts.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.602
 Good ideas.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.404
 NARRATOR: To explore
 this high-voltage theory,

19:00.405 --> 19:03.405
 Tory gets started by modifying
 a pair of mannequins.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.978
 Ballistic-gel golfer...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.979
 will lightning be attracted
 to your golf cleats?

19:10.782 --> 19:12.116
 NARRATOR:
 For the later tests,

19:12.117 --> 19:14.685
 it's crucial
 that these golfer stand-ins

19:14.686 --> 19:17.686
 have the same electrical
 properties as the human body.

19:17.789 --> 19:20.789
 And filling them
 with a special ballistics gel

19:21.260 --> 19:22.326
 should do just that.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.694
 TORY: The ballistics gel
 is gonna give us

19:23.695 --> 19:26.695
 the same kind of resistance to
 electricity as the human body.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.965
 [ Straining ] Okay.
 Yeah.

19:30.966 --> 19:32.600
 KARI:
 He's a unicorn.

19:32.601 --> 19:35.436
 NARRATOR: When they're set,
 they head out to the links

19:35.437 --> 19:37.438
 in search of lightning.

19:37.439 --> 19:40.439
 Wait!

19:41.843 --> 19:44.011
 NARRATOR:
 The PG&E Technology Center

19:44.012 --> 19:47.012
 is one of the Mythbusters'
 favorite playing grounds.

19:47.115 --> 19:50.115
 But even though from the outside
 it looks like a giant golf ball,

19:51.053 --> 19:54.053
 there's not a fairway
 to be found.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.690
 First up, Kari gets
 the lightning lowdown.

19:58.226 --> 19:59.460
 How does
 this simulate lightning?

19:59.461 --> 20:02.029
 This uses a generator
 back in the shed back there

20:02.030 --> 20:04.799
 and creates very,
 very high-voltage electricity

20:04.800 --> 20:06.534
 that comes through a ball
 over there,

20:06.535 --> 20:08.135
 and it goes to the ground.

20:08.136 --> 20:11.072
 NARRATOR: Because lightning
 is no laughing matter,

20:11.073 --> 20:13.407
 here's an important
 safety message.

20:13.408 --> 20:15.576
 Even our crews,
 who are specially trained

20:15.577 --> 20:18.212
 to work in extremely
 hazardous conditions,

20:18.213 --> 20:20.147
 know that when the lightning
 is coming,

20:20.148 --> 20:21.582
 they need to seek shelter
 immediately,

20:21.583 --> 20:23.551
 and everybody else
 should do the same thing.

20:23.552 --> 20:24.752
 This is our lightning source,

20:24.753 --> 20:27.753
 so we need to set up our golfers
 equidistant from this source.

20:27.823 --> 20:29.156
 And then we dress
 our golfer dummies --

20:29.157 --> 20:31.225
 one with plastic cleats,
 one with metal cleats --

20:31.226 --> 20:32.660
 and see
 where the lightning strikes.

20:32.661 --> 20:33.961
 This is gonna be fun.

20:33.962 --> 20:35.329
 [ Laughter ]

20:35.330 --> 20:38.330
 NARRATOR: First they need
 to lay out some groundwork.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.101
 GRANT:
 So what we're trying to do here

20:40.102 --> 20:42.136
 is simulate a golf course.

20:42.137 --> 20:43.170
 That's why we have this.

20:43.171 --> 20:46.171
 It's a copper plane,
 and we have a clamp.

20:46.241 --> 20:48.175
 We're gonna connect the clamp
 to the copper plane,

20:48.176 --> 20:51.176
 and that's gonna be connected
 to the ground of the facility.

20:52.047 --> 20:55.047
 And that will give us
 that electrical-earth simulation

20:56.518 --> 20:58.185
 that we need
 to conduct this test.

20:58.186 --> 21:00.821
 NARRATOR: Then because
 there's nothing like the feel

21:00.822 --> 21:03.822
 of fresh green turf underfoot,
 they lay out some sod.

21:05.293 --> 21:07.228
 It's a golf course.
 Sweet.

21:07.229 --> 21:08.262
 NARRATOR: Next...

21:08.263 --> 21:11.263
 You guys
 got any power around here?

21:11.767 --> 21:14.735
 NARRATOR:... Tory removes
 the tops of the dummy's heads

21:14.736 --> 21:17.736
 and soles of their feet,
 so when the lightning strikes,

21:17.806 --> 21:20.741
 it will have a clear path
 to the ground.

21:20.742 --> 21:23.742
 [ Giggles ]

21:24.312 --> 21:27.312
 NARRATOR: Time to get kitted up
 in appropriate attire.

21:27.749 --> 21:30.618
 We want to give this myth the
 best possible chance of working,

21:30.619 --> 21:33.619
 so we have found
 some leather-soled shoes

21:34.189 --> 21:35.556
 with metal cleats.

21:35.557 --> 21:37.825
 It's gonna give us
 the best conduction path.

21:37.826 --> 21:39.760
 Now, to be
 a really good comparison,

21:39.761 --> 21:42.761
 we have our modern rubber-soled
 shoes with plastic cleats.

21:44.132 --> 21:47.132
 NARRATOR: And all laced up,
 they're ready to hit the green.

21:48.437 --> 21:51.272
 Wow.
 That's a well-attired golfer.

21:51.273 --> 21:54.141
 Yeah, I've never seen a golfer
 with just golf shoes.

21:54.142 --> 21:55.409
 That would freak me out.

21:55.410 --> 21:56.977
 NARRATOR: Finally,
 they place both golfers

21:56.978 --> 21:59.978
 the exact same distance
 from the lightning source.

22:01.116 --> 22:03.250
 This guy is at 46 1/2.

22:03.251 --> 22:05.252
 -Yeah!
 -Great!

22:05.253 --> 22:06.987
 Perfect is good enough for me.

22:06.988 --> 22:09.356
 NARRATOR: Oh, no.
 It's starting to rain.

22:09.357 --> 22:12.357
 Who will be struck out
 of the game first?

22:13.795 --> 22:15.930
 And right here, right now,

22:15.931 --> 22:18.566
 it's time to put that theory
 to the test.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.835
 Well, Jamie is just about
 to get in the backseat,

22:20.836 --> 22:23.637
 while he lets Jerry control
 everything to do with the car.

22:23.638 --> 22:25.306
 Jerry is 100 % blind,

22:25.307 --> 22:27.741
 and that means the stakes here
 are pretty high.

22:27.742 --> 22:29.243
 And if I had to make
 a prediction,

22:29.244 --> 22:32.179
 I think there might be
 some curbage on this trip.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.180
 NARRATOR: Well, with those words
 of wisdom, it's go time.

22:35.784 --> 22:38.185
 Jamie and Jerry,
 are you guys ready to go?

22:38.186 --> 22:40.221
 -Ready to rock 'n' roll.
 -Yeah, we're all set.

22:40.222 --> 22:41.622
 [ Laughs ]

22:41.623 --> 22:43.624
 Okay, we'll wait for you.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.226
 On your mark, go ahead.

22:45.227 --> 22:48.227
 I'd just let the brake go and
 see -- We'll start to roll.

22:48.597 --> 22:50.664
 Cool.
 That's perfect.

22:50.665 --> 22:53.665
 NARRATOR: Jamie's strategy
 is to start off nice and easy.

22:54.703 --> 22:56.103
 That's perfect.

22:56.104 --> 22:59.104
 I think the trick here is gonna
 be to work incrementally.

22:59.574 --> 23:02.574
 We're gonna start slow and
 gradually build up from there.

23:03.445 --> 23:04.712
 Right.

23:04.713 --> 23:05.980
 Perfect.

23:05.981 --> 23:08.981
 We've got an actual
 blind person driving a car.

23:12.921 --> 23:14.922
 You don't see that every day.

23:14.923 --> 23:16.924
 NARRATOR: Obeying all the rules
 of the road,

23:16.925 --> 23:19.925
 other than having a completely
 blind person at the wheel,

23:20.095 --> 23:22.496
 they come to a 90-degree turn.

23:22.497 --> 23:23.731
 JAMIE:
 Okay, cool.

23:23.732 --> 23:26.732
 A hard right.

23:27.002 --> 23:28.736
 Straighten it out.

23:28.737 --> 23:31.405
 NARRATOR: And with that nailed,
 Jamie utters the words

23:31.406 --> 23:33.807
 the insurance company
 doesn't want to hear.

23:33.808 --> 23:35.075
 Give it a little gas.

23:35.076 --> 23:38.076
 NARRATOR: That's right. Jamie
 gets Jerry to put his foot down.

23:38.780 --> 23:39.914
 More gas.

23:39.915 --> 23:41.615
 That looks good.
 Okay.

23:41.616 --> 23:43.551
 That's a good speed.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.287
 He's going about 20 miles
 an hour now.

23:46.288 --> 23:48.188
 This is for real, man.

23:48.189 --> 23:49.323
 A little more gas.

23:49.324 --> 23:52.324
 NARRATOR: Traveling over
 the limit in a residential area,

23:52.627 --> 23:54.929
 Jerry is officially speeding.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.930
 ADAM: 35 miles an hour.
 [ Laughs ]

23:58.500 --> 24:00.901
 NARRATOR:
 Jerry's final test requirement

24:00.902 --> 24:02.202
 could be the toughest.

24:02.203 --> 24:05.039
 Now comes the last obstacle --
 parking.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.206
 Start to brake.

24:06.207 --> 24:09.207
 Now turn hard left.

24:09.311 --> 24:10.744
 NARRATOR:
 But it looks like Jerry

24:10.745 --> 24:13.745
 will successfully avoid
 traffic school.

24:14.115 --> 24:15.549
 JAMIE: And stop.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.784
 You made it.

24:20.522 --> 24:23.522
 With no injuries,
 no impacts, no nothing.

24:24.626 --> 24:26.660
 -That was fantastic!
 -Yo.

24:26.661 --> 24:28.529
 -Jerry, shake my hand.
 -Yo!

24:28.530 --> 24:30.331
 -You are a natural.
 -Yo.

24:30.332 --> 24:32.366
 [ Laughs ]

24:32.367 --> 24:33.767
 I had a good guide.

24:33.768 --> 24:36.270
 I think that Jerry
 was better than either of us

24:36.271 --> 24:39.271
 'cause he has no preconceptions
 about how he wants to drive.

24:39.941 --> 24:42.910
 Yeah, he followed
 my instructions exactly,

24:42.911 --> 24:44.712
 and it was a piece of cake.

24:44.713 --> 24:47.681
 ADAM: Jerry's ability
 to drive is astounding.

24:47.682 --> 24:49.717
 I wouldn't have known
 he was blind,

24:49.718 --> 24:52.453
 watching him drive
 around our course.

24:52.454 --> 24:53.887
 That was amazing.

24:53.888 --> 24:55.222
 NARRATOR:
 But watch this space

24:55.223 --> 24:58.223
 because there's a dangerous
 twist in the tale for this myth.

24:59.327 --> 25:02.327
 Would Jerry be as in control
 if Jamie wasn't?

25:03.331 --> 25:04.732
 ADAM:
 Jerry, what do you say?

25:04.733 --> 25:06.300
 Are you willing
 to let a drunk Jamie

25:06.301 --> 25:07.935
 guide you while driving?

25:07.936 --> 25:10.137
 Sure, as long as I get
 a shot at that bottle

25:10.138 --> 25:11.338
 after we're all over.

25:11.339 --> 25:14.339
 That's the spirit!

25:16.478 --> 25:17.678
 NARRATOR:
 In this thunderdome,

25:17.679 --> 25:20.280
 the team set up
 two ballistics dummies

25:20.281 --> 25:22.750
 equidistant
 from a high-voltage source.

25:22.751 --> 25:25.751
 The only difference is one is
 wearing shoes with metal cleats.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.088
 The other -- plastic.

25:28.089 --> 25:30.457
 So, what are they looking for?

25:30.458 --> 25:33.427
 To confirm this myth,
 we need to see a definite trend

25:33.428 --> 25:36.428
 of lightning discharging into
 the dummy with the metal cleats.

25:37.432 --> 25:39.266
 NARRATOR: And with the dummies
 sitting pretty,

25:39.267 --> 25:41.835
 it's time to unleash
 the lightning.

25:41.836 --> 25:44.836
 All right, you guys,
 this is it -- 10 strikes.

25:44.973 --> 25:47.041
 We got two identical dummies.

25:47.042 --> 25:49.343
 One has metal cleats.
 The other has plastic.

25:49.344 --> 25:51.011
 All right, fire it up.

25:51.012 --> 25:52.946
 KARI: Aah!

25:52.947 --> 25:54.815
 One on plastic.

25:54.816 --> 25:56.650
 Two on plastic.

25:56.651 --> 25:58.218
 Oh!
 There we go.

25:58.219 --> 25:59.553
 Two plastic, one metal.

25:59.554 --> 26:00.954
 NARRATOR:
 The guys are unleashing

26:00.955 --> 26:02.556
 10 bolts from the blue

26:02.557 --> 26:04.825
 and keeping a tally
 of who gets hit --

26:04.826 --> 26:07.826
 the metal-cleat golfer or his
 plastic-preferring counterpart.

26:08.763 --> 26:11.763
 Two on the metal,
 four on the plastic.

26:11.933 --> 26:14.933
 NARRATOR: And after a shocking
 few minutes, the results are in.

26:16.171 --> 26:19.171
 Six on the plastic,
 four on the metal.

26:20.442 --> 26:21.642
 GRANT:
 So, for our first test,

26:21.643 --> 26:23.977
 we had two identical
 ballistics-gel dummies

26:23.978 --> 26:26.714
 at equal distances
 from our high-voltage source.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.583
 What we saw
 was a fairly equal distribution

26:29.584 --> 26:31.485
 of lightning strikes
 between the two,

26:31.486 --> 26:34.254
 which indicates
 that there's no difference

26:34.255 --> 26:35.556
 having the metal cleats.

26:35.557 --> 26:37.825
 So that means metal cleats
 do not attract lightning.

26:37.826 --> 26:38.992
 This myth is busted.

26:38.993 --> 26:41.061
 -Busted.
 -Busted.

26:41.062 --> 26:43.664
 NARRATOR: So, in bad weather,
 wearing metal spikes

26:43.665 --> 26:45.999
 won't increase the chance
 of lightning strikes,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.268
 but what about holding a club?

26:48.269 --> 26:50.704
 If you notice,
 during your backswing,

26:50.705 --> 26:52.740
 you actually become
 a lightning rod.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.275
 So what I'm gonna do is attach
 this golf club to that golfer,

26:55.276 --> 26:57.444
 and we're gonna find out,
 if you are crazy enough

26:57.445 --> 27:00.445
 to play during a storm,
 what might happen.

27:48.696 --> 27:50.364
 Okay, the greenskeeper
 is going mad

27:50.365 --> 27:51.832
 trying to catch a gopher
 he just can't get,

27:51.833 --> 27:54.833
 so he decides he's going
 to exterminate him with C-4.

27:55.103 --> 27:57.771
 He puts C-4 down
 each of the gopher holes

27:57.772 --> 27:59.473
 and gets ready to blow him
 to smithereens.

27:59.474 --> 28:02.474
 But before he pushes the button,
 50 yards away,

28:02.844 --> 28:05.379
 there's a golfer
 trying to make the winning putt.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.380
 He hits the ball, but it catches
 just on the edge of the cup.

28:08.716 --> 28:11.285
 And then the groundskeeper
 sets off the explosions,

28:11.286 --> 28:14.286
 with big bursts of fire,
 destroys half the golf course,

28:14.355 --> 28:15.756
 and sinks the winning putt.

28:15.757 --> 28:18.325
 So we need to find out
 if C-4 causes that much damage

28:18.326 --> 28:20.694
 and if it does,
 is the shock wave strong enough

28:20.695 --> 28:22.095
 to knock the ball into the cup?

28:22.096 --> 28:22.963
 Exactly.

28:22.964 --> 28:25.964
 Okay, let's get some explosives
 and head back to Pebble Beach.

28:26.034 --> 28:27.334
 Actually, your golf swing

28:27.335 --> 28:29.603
 already destroyed
 half of their golf course,

28:29.604 --> 28:31.038
 so they're not letting us
 come back,

28:31.039 --> 28:33.707
 so we have to find another place
 to do the experiment.

 NARRATOR:
 It's a great gopher golf scene

28:39.013 --> 28:41.982
 where you get two myths
 for the price of one.

28:41.983 --> 28:44.983
 First, will C-4 really explode
 into great balls of fire?

28:49.958 --> 28:52.826
 And second,
 will the resulting shock wave

28:52.827 --> 28:55.827
 be enough to knock
 a teetering ball into the hole?

28:57.165 --> 28:58.899
 As a golf-course substitute,

28:58.900 --> 29:01.900

 perfect for their experiments.

29:11.246 --> 29:12.646
 It kind of looks like
 a golf course.

29:12.647 --> 29:14.014
 There's tons of gopher holes.

29:14.015 --> 29:16.149
 And they've agreed
 to let us blow it up with C-4.

 Sure enough, the ground

 the telltale signs of gophers.

29:23.091 --> 29:25.325

29:29.063 --> 29:32.063
 this is a gopher ghost town.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.234
 For this golf myth,
 we have two things to test.

29:34.235 --> 29:36.837
 They come from the last scene
 in "Caddyshack,"

29:36.838 --> 29:39.072
 which is an American icon,
 if you ask me.

29:39.073 --> 29:41.541
 First of all, can C-4
 create the kind of explosions

29:41.542 --> 29:44.542
 that they have happening
 in that last golf scene?

29:44.812 --> 29:47.648
 And secondly,
 can the ground shake enough

29:47.649 --> 29:49.016
 to drop that golf ball,

29:49.017 --> 29:52.017
 teetering on the edge
 of the hole, into the hole?

29:52.353 --> 29:55.353
 So, 50 yards that way.

29:55.423 --> 29:56.523
 All right.

29:56.524 --> 29:58.358
 NARRATOR:
 From closely watching the movie,

29:58.359 --> 30:01.028
 they've calculated
 that it was about 50 yards

 Seeing the amount of C-4
 that we have out in this field,

 I think it's probably
 a 50/50 chance

 of the ball not going
 in the cup,

 between the explosion

31:25.513 --> 31:28.048

 in real gopher holes

31:28.049 --> 31:31.049
 and what you see in the movie
 is the element of fire.

 And what we saw is just a blast
 of dirt going straight up.

31:35.356 --> 31:38.225

 the movie fireball was a fake.

 That's not surprising.

32:09.357 --> 32:10.490

36:58.612 --> 37:01.612
 JERRY: The situation
 felt a little less in control,

37:02.483 --> 37:05.151
 and twice Derek intervened.

37:05.152 --> 37:08.152
 He grabbed the wheel once,
 and he also hit the brake once.

37:09.056 --> 37:11.691
 Hard right.

37:11.692 --> 37:13.226
 NARRATOR:
 But the guys do manage

37:13.227 --> 37:15.862
 to pull into the drive
 in one piece.

37:15.863 --> 37:18.598
 You got me home,
 and I was drunk.

37:18.599 --> 37:20.200
 [ Chuckles ]
 Thank you, Jerry.

37:20.201 --> 37:21.634
 You're my best friend.

37:21.635 --> 37:23.169
 You bet your sweet bippy.

37:23.170 --> 37:26.170
 [ Laughter ]

37:26.507 --> 37:28.408
 NARRATOR:
 From where Adam was sitting,

37:28.409 --> 37:30.276
 there was
 a very distinct difference

37:30.277 --> 37:33.277
 between Jamie's navigation
 skills sober versus drunk.

37:35.049 --> 37:37.183
 ADAM:
 You were weaving much more

37:37.184 --> 37:39.119
 from right to left,
 right to left.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.421
 There was a lot of delay
 in correction.

37:41.422 --> 37:43.356
 And if I was a cop behind you,

37:43.357 --> 37:44.991
 I would be pulling
 that car over,

37:44.992 --> 37:47.260
 thinking there's a drunk man
 behind the wheel.

37:47.261 --> 37:50.261
 I don't know which is worse --
 being blind or blind drunk.

37:51.298 --> 37:52.932
 NARRATOR:
 So, if you ever consider

37:52.933 --> 37:55.735
 the blind-driving method
 of getting somewhere,

37:55.736 --> 37:57.303
 call a cab.

37:57.304 --> 38:00.304
 JERRY:
 Hoo-yah!

38:03.310 --> 38:06.310
 Can we stop doing these drinking
 myths? I don't feel so good.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.680
 [ Chuckles ] Okay, I'll do the
 heavy lifting in the wrap-up.

38:10.284 --> 38:13.086
 I think you and I proved
 on the closed course

38:13.087 --> 38:15.155
 that, with a little practice,
 it is possible

38:15.156 --> 38:16.389
 to drive while blindfolded

38:16.390 --> 38:19.125
 as long as your instructions
 are competent.

38:19.126 --> 38:21.194
 And our blind guy that we got --

38:21.195 --> 38:23.496
 Jerry -- actually turned out
 to be a great driver.

38:23.497 --> 38:25.131
 He did, and that combined

38:25.132 --> 38:27.100
 with the story we found
 of someone actually doing it,

38:27.101 --> 38:29.669
 I'd say this one
 is totally confirmed.

38:29.670 --> 38:32.338
 It's illegal, but you can do it.
 It's confirmed.

38:32.339 --> 38:34.974
 You know what my favorite part
 of this whole story was?

38:34.975 --> 38:36.509
 Was that after you got drunk,

38:36.510 --> 38:39.510
 your instructions made Jerry
 drive as if he was drunk.

38:41.081 --> 38:43.183
 I would have never called that.

38:43.184 --> 38:45.819
 Hmm.
 I thought I did pretty well.

38:45.820 --> 38:47.587
 Yeah, but that's
 the whole point.
