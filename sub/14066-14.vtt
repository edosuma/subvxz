00:00.030 --> 00:01.400
I don't think it's working out.

00:01.440 --> 00:03.510
–What isn't working out?
–Us.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.240
Andrea Michele, the client.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.630
Am I getting my ass whipped?

00:06.670 --> 00:07.670
Not that I don't like that.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.480
You need to tone it down.

00:09.490 --> 00:10.370
Now I'm horny.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.900
“United States coast guard auxiliary,

00:11.940 --> 00:13.870
a volunteer component of the coast guard.”
–Let's go.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.550
I get seasick, but whatever.

00:15.590 --> 00:17.140
Oh, we're gonna be in the military.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.420
Already my penis feels bigger.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.180
Katie.

00:36.190 --> 00:38.840
A court-appointed, indigent
client— cheque forgery.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.880
I should be able to manage that.

00:39.920 --> 00:40.960
Yes, manage it quickly, please,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.884
so we can put you on a case that might
actually make this firm some money.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.240
Hello.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.490
“Dear Maureen, being with you is being

00:54.500 --> 00:56.970
”thinking about the
last time we made love,

00:57.010 --> 01:01.050
”I feel both a total sense of
peace and a voracious hunger.

01:01.060 --> 01:05.200
”When I am on you, I am. Meet me.”

01:05.760 --> 01:08.100
That's sweet, but I'm not Maureen.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.130
I'm Maureen.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.210
Guess who wrote this.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.460
The suspense is simply
more than I can bear.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.540
My pastor.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.730
We had an affair.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.920
And this is one of the letters
he wrote while we were together.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.050
I loved him.

01:19.060 --> 01:20.120
He dumped me.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.720
I want to sue him.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.340
–Clarence.
–Yes.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.120
This is Maureen.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.350
She loves her pastor.

01:25.390 --> 01:29.350
Clarence will help you. Pay no
attention to his shifty eyes.

01:31.130 --> 01:32.540
Hello.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.710
–Who are you?
–Who are you?

01:35.040 --> 01:35.610
Busy.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.590
Andrea, hi.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.580
My friends call me the “beav”.

01:38.970 --> 01:39.770
Uh, oh, yes. I remember you.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.900
You're the one that sued
over the nuclear power plant.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.730
Well, what is it today, Beav?

01:45.780 --> 01:46.960
Congratulations.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.470
Who's the lucky troop ship?

01:48.510 --> 01:50.170
Funny. Got a first name?

01:50.180 --> 01:51.240
Extremely.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.160
Extremely Busy.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.060
Hold on! I bring business.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.420
This ring is a zirconium.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.730
It's supposed to be my mother.

01:56.770 --> 01:58.690
You're very tall, by the way.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.630
I sent her ashes to a company that
takes out the carbon, heats it up,

02:01.670 --> 02:04.520
smashes it down and turns
it into a memorial diamond.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.480
But this, as I said, is not a diamond.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.950
It's a cubic zirconium.

02:07.990 --> 02:09.400
I've been defrauded.

02:09.410 --> 02:14.860
I'm looking for a tall, distinguished yet
privately debauched attorney to satisfy the Beav,

02:14.900 --> 02:16.540
and you're it.

Boston Legal
Season 04 Episode 14
Rescue Me

02:50.730 --> 02:53.540
Hello, Mr Morris. I'm Katie
Lloyd. I'll be representing you.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.660
Leo.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.680
Aries.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.120
Now we've got that out of the way.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.340
No, my name is Leo.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.940
Oh, I beg your pardom, um…

03:01.950 --> 03:05.600
I see you're charged with felony forgery,
and there appears to be ample evidence.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.350
Well, that's only because I did it.

03:07.390 --> 03:08.810
Oh, I see. Do you—
do you have a reason?

03:08.850 --> 03:11.120
I do. I'm dying.

03:11.130 --> 03:12.318
You don't look it.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.130
You got me.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.648
I'm not, and therein lies the problem.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.500
You seem confused.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.610
I'd be glad to explain over dinner.

03:18.650 --> 03:19.650
How about you do so now?

03:19.690 --> 03:20.290
Okay.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.970
Are you familiar with
viatical settlements?

03:22.010 --> 03:25.540
A termally ill person signs over his
life insurance policy for up-front cash—

03:25.580 --> 03:28.880
And when that person dies, the company
collects the policy's full death benefit.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.650
Yes. Four years ago, I
was diagnosed with AIDS.

03:31.690 --> 03:32.970
Bad blood transfusion.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.100
“He adds to assure me he's straight.”

03:35.140 --> 03:37.730
Anyway, I didn't respond to
any of the medications, none.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.390
My T-cells plummeted,
my viral load soared.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.370
I couldn't work. I had no savings.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.660
I needed money to live on.

03:43.700 --> 03:44.400
Well, to die on.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.220
So you sold your life insurance policy?

03:46.260 --> 03:50.430
Yeah, they gave $40,000 and agreed
to cover my health and life insurance
benefits for the rest of my life,

03:50.470 --> 03:52.120
which seemed to be a few months away.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.730
But then these new
treatments came out—

03:53.770 --> 03:57.440
they call them rescue drugs for AIDS patients
who don't respond to normal medications—

03:57.480 --> 03:58.880
and turned things around.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.020
Great for me. I get to live.

04:01.030 --> 04:05.050
Not so great for the viatical company
which promised to pay for my health
insurance for the rest of my life.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.000
And now they want out of the deal?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.250
And I still need the deal.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.730
Basically, if I don't get
the right treatment, I die.

04:09.770 --> 04:14.300
So I took one of their cheques, made counterfeits
and started paying the premiums that way.

04:14.340 --> 04:15.910
Evidently that's a crime?

04:15.950 --> 04:19.269
Well, I've been assigned by
the court to your case, so…

04:19.310 --> 04:20.709
I'm in luck.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.460
I told him to get rid
of it, but he didn't.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.750
What do you expect me to do?

04:30.790 --> 04:32.020
Backstop him.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.920
Help make it go away.

04:33.930 --> 04:35.830
She's suing her pastor for dumping her?

04:35.870 --> 04:36.580
That's ridiculous.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.600
Ah, of course it is.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.960
This is the firm where ridiculous—

04:45.010 --> 04:46.580
Excuse me.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.580
Hello.

04:54.450 --> 04:55.930
Need something?

04:55.940 --> 04:56.900
What are you doing?

04:56.940 --> 04:58.090
Mouth-to-mouth.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.600
Coast guard training.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.730
We need to know CPR.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.640
No tongue.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.090
I've saved you some time.

05:09.130 --> 05:11.180
I've called the president of the
company that makes these rings,

05:11.220 --> 05:13.690
and he's agreed to come
here and meet with you.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.830
You should be on your knees thanking me.

05:15.870 --> 05:18.576
Win this case, and
I'll get down on mine.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.520
Well, had she
been drinking or—

05:34.560 --> 05:37.130
No, no. It was a school day.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.010
She had been up the prior
night studying for a test.

05:40.050 --> 05:43.690
Earlier that week, she had pulled
an all-nighter to finish a paper.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.370
They think she fell asleep
at the wheel.

05:46.770 --> 05:49.730
How can I be of help, Mrs Joseph?

05:51.130 --> 05:56.150
I believe that my daughter
was hugely sleep deprived

05:56.160 --> 05:59.240
as a result of both stress and workload.

05:59.250 --> 06:04.992
I partly blame myself for even letting her
drive because I knew how tired she was, but…

06:05.110 --> 06:08.740
she wouldn't be dead
if it weren't for the…

06:11.880 --> 06:15.570
I want to sue her high school.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.490
You can't use a snorkel, man.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.210
Why not?

06:19.220 --> 06:20.210
Well, they won't let you.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.270
We're supposed to be
able to save people.

06:21.310 --> 06:22.980
You look like you need to be rescued.

06:23.020 --> 06:24.380
Denny, I'm afraid of the water.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.720
Don't say that to the coast guard!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.730
They won't let you in, man.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.250
What's his problem now?

06:33.260 --> 06:35.600
I have no idea.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.920
They'll drop the
charges, just like that?

06:40.960 --> 06:41.850
No, not just like that.

06:41.890 --> 06:44.020
It took a phenomenal bit
of lawyering on my part.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.070
And it's conditioned on the viatical
company agreeing not to press charges.

06:47.110 --> 06:49.780
I have a settlement conference
scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00.

06:49.820 --> 06:50.870
Well, what's your cause of action?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.300
Emotional distress.

06:52.310 --> 06:53.320
For a break up?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.590
Well, this was her pastor.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.250
There may be a special duty
of care, like with a therapist.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.220
I don't know, Clarence.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.090
Well, I might as well try,
what's to lose?

07:00.130 --> 07:00.960
Honestly?

07:00.970 --> 07:02.520
Your career.

07:02.530 --> 07:05.920
I don't mean to be harsh, but
if you want to advance here,

07:05.960 --> 07:10.200
taking cases that waste the firm's time and
resources isn't the best way to accomplish that.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.800
Carl's not happy you ran with this.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.690
He'll be happy if we get something.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.460
You okay?

07:41.290 --> 07:43.840
So talk to me. What's the matter?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.380
It's not a new discussion.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.250
The cases we…

07:51.830 --> 07:56.830
I've got Clarence and Lorraine handling a woman
who's suing because her pastor dumped her.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.470
Katie is taking care of
a court-appointed matter.

07:59.510 --> 08:03.060
Denny and Alan are very busy
trying to join the coast guard.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.730
Your friend Andrea wants
me to sue some crematorium

08:06.740 --> 08:11.290
for turning her mother
into a cubic zirconium.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.610
It seems like
every case we do—

08:13.620 --> 08:15.690
Carl. Sorry.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.470
I just took a client.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.310
Her daughter was killed in a car wreck,

08:20.350 --> 08:22.580
and she wants to sue her high
school for wrongful death,

08:22.620 --> 08:25.040
claiming they made
her kid sleep deprived.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.110
I just couldn't say no to the woman.

08:27.150 --> 08:28.800
Sorry.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.850
That's who we are, Carl.

08:37.409 --> 08:42.440
Would you like to lighten
the mood by talking about us?

08:44.010 --> 08:45.740
Sure.

08:46.030 --> 08:49.160
Have you really been that unhappy?

08:52.180 --> 08:53.610
I think…

08:54.090 --> 08:59.130
when people become parents, their personal
lives get pushed to the back burner,

08:59.170 --> 09:01.350
where they sit dormant for years.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.280
Husbands and wives become…

09:03.290 --> 09:05.800
ancillary to each other,
'causing many a marriage to fail.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.220
Mine did, as did the
dozen or so of yours.

09:09.230 --> 09:10.650
Funny.

09:11.630 --> 09:14.430
You and I are very compatible, Shirley.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.370
We like the same movies,
we go to museums together.

09:17.410 --> 09:22.740
We just make splendid company when we're
not off independently doing our own things.

09:22.780 --> 09:26.040
And we make excuses for the lack of…

09:26.050 --> 09:28.470
let's call it heat.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.580
We're not that old, Shirley.

09:33.590 --> 09:37.220
And sexually, you are still a
beautiful, passionate woman.

09:37.260 --> 09:41.430
I'm still capable of passion,
without medication even.

09:41.750 --> 09:46.190
I mean, these are the years when our
personal lives should be very much

09:46.230 --> 09:48.270
on the front burner again.

09:48.770 --> 09:52.340
And with you and I, together…

09:53.680 --> 09:55.610
they're not.

09:55.620 --> 10:01.340
Which brings me back to:
“you deserve more, and so do I.”

10:04.350 --> 10:06.740
Does that make sense?

10:08.810 --> 10:11.470
A little too much, actually.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.230
Shirley, I've represented you.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.410
I now need you to represent me.

10:17.420 --> 10:18.280
Why?

10:18.290 --> 10:23.850
It's possible I might be disqualified from
the coast guard cause I'm afraid of water.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.750
I want to sue under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.090
I think not.

10:39.090 --> 10:44.290
An egregious wrong by your client has resulted
in a great spiritual loss to miss Janely.

10:44.330 --> 10:46.820
They banged, he bailed, she bruised.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.200
We're prepared to go forward with this.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.130
But we're willing to
entertain a settlement offer.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.840
Would we be here if he'd
kept on slapping her sheets?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.940
It wasn't cheap and ugly.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.480
It was a profound love.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.150
Tell her.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.150
I was…

11:05.160 --> 11:08.810
intoxicated… I was powerless.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.200
Did you love me?

11:19.830 --> 11:21.430
No.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.830
But…

11:27.410 --> 11:29.370
It was lust.

11:29.380 --> 11:34.180
What we were doing was
a sin and had to stop.

11:34.460 --> 11:39.610
And I couldn't leave my wife
and marry you just for the lust.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.450
That would just be sinning
against you even more.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.090
W-w-well, what
do I do now?

11:48.770 --> 11:54.750
If I don't have you, what do I do?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.900
She was taking four AP courses.

12:05.910 --> 12:08.950
She was involved in
at least 15 activities.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.580
This was by her choice.

12:10.590 --> 12:13.050
Well, it was and it wasn't.

12:13.060 --> 12:16.380
She saw everybody else doing it,
and she didn't want to lag behind.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.800
It just seems
there's this frenzy,

12:18.810 --> 12:21.480
be it SAT scores or
getting into the best college,

12:21.520 --> 12:27.180
and the kids, even the ones who get A's
like Samantha, feel they can ways do more.

12:27.190 --> 12:28.560
And you blame the school?

12:28.600 --> 12:32.550
Well, I realize that some
of it comes from the parents.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.250
We all want our kids to succeed, but…

12:36.260 --> 12:38.940
but most of the pressure
comes from their peers.

12:38.980 --> 12:42.150
And certainly the schools
can see the stress.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.380
It's widespread.

12:44.390 --> 12:48.030
Do the parents see the stress?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.370
Yes, and I did.

12:50.380 --> 12:53.810
But how do you get your kid to
decompress when she feels that

12:53.850 --> 12:56.450
if she doesn't take four AP courses,

12:56.460 --> 13:00.920
if she doesn't succeed in sports, if
she isn't involved in school government,

13:00.960 --> 13:03.640
then she can forget about
going to a selective college?

13:03.680 --> 13:08.000
After all of her activities, she would
come home from school at 9:00 or 10:00,

13:08.040 --> 13:10.820
only then to start her homework.

13:10.830 --> 13:14.270
Now these schools need to
set limits, and they don't.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.370
Did you?

13:15.380 --> 13:18.650
–I tried, but I––
–Ever lean on h to do better?

13:19.870 --> 13:21.910
Sometimes.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.360
And I regret it.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.590
If I had her back, I would say,

13:26.600 --> 13:31.350
“honey, let's go to the beach or take
a hayride or build a snowman or”…

13:31.360 --> 13:34.520
My god, these kids don't even
go on spring break these days.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.580
They use the time to visit
colleges or take SAT courses.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.890
I'm sorry, judge.

13:40.930 --> 13:45.880
I know that you don't want tears, but—
but we put too much on these kids.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.020
They don't sleep.

13:48.030 --> 13:51.090
And my baby's dead because of it.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.030
Good morning.

14:06.070 --> 14:06.960
My name's Katie Lloyd.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.250
I represent Leonardo Morris.

14:08.290 --> 14:09.950
Yes, we've actually met before.

14:09.990 --> 14:10.980
How are you, Leo?

14:11.020 --> 14:11.720
Alive.

14:11.730 --> 14:13.720
I can be such a killjoy.

14:13.730 --> 14:16.820
And I'm Bob Winthrop, the
CEO of Living Securities.

14:16.860 --> 14:18.120
–Katie Lloyd.
–Pleasure.

14:18.160 --> 14:21.900
First, let me say, Mr Morris,
we are happy for your recovery.

14:21.940 --> 14:23.120
I've met with the district attorney.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.300
I suspect she'd agree not to prosecute on the
cheque forging if you agree not to press charges.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.520
Done.

14:28.530 --> 14:29.970
–Really?
–Of course.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.340
And I assume you'll agree
not to pursue us civilly.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.740
I can't do that.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.180
You entered into a contract
to pay for my health insurance.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.130
You breached it.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.420
That contract presumes
a meeting of the minds.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.710
Clearly there wasn't here.

14:40.750 --> 14:41.990
–How do you figure?
–Leo.

14:42.030 --> 14:43.240
She asks.

14:43.250 --> 14:48.470
Well, uh, I don't want to sound like
a ghoul, but that contract presumes
you'd be dead within six months.

14:48.510 --> 14:51.040
As it turns out, you could live forever.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.700
That was you not wanting
to sound like a ghoul?

14:52.740 --> 14:55.640
Look, everybody knows
what viatical companies do.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.650
We buy life insurance
policies from dying people.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.500
He presented himself as a dying man.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.340
He didn't die.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.040
What did you do with my mother?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.320
Well, as I was explaining
to Mr Sack, uh,

15:14.360 --> 15:17.630
despite our best efforts to provide
you with a carbon, cremain-based gem—

15:17.670 --> 15:19.220
Yeah, where is she?

15:19.230 --> 15:20.860
We encountered a glitch.

15:20.870 --> 15:24.490
If you'll refer to the contract, “in the
event of a material processing complication,

15:24.530 --> 15:28.460
”Life-Jewel guarantees a substitute
of equal or greater value.”

15:28.500 --> 15:33.410
Cubic zirconium is of
greater value than ashes.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.340
What, are you kidding me?

15:34.380 --> 15:36.100
I'll gladly provide you a full refund.

15:36.140 --> 15:39.250
–I want you to refund me my mother, her ashes.
–Plus…

15:39.290 --> 15:42.550
$25,000

15:42.990 --> 15:44.010
Well, we'll see you in court.

15:44.050 --> 15:47.040
–Wait. Now let's just hold on a second.
–Of course we're not going to accept that insulting offer.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.970
–Andrea, look––
–Here's a guarantee, Mr Parkes:

15:49.010 --> 15:52.330
call your lawyer. We
will see you in court.

15:53.910 --> 15:56.080
Go on. Go.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.200
What?

16:15.740 --> 16:16.980
You're upset with me.

16:17.020 --> 16:20.500
I'm upset with myself
for being manipulated.

16:20.510 --> 16:24.360
Look, uh, may I call you “Extremely,”
though it's a funny first name?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.550
Call me Carl, Beav.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.720
You know, you need
to loosen up a little.

16:28.760 --> 16:32.700
Now how often does it happen that an oversexed
woman barges in with a cubic zirconium,

16:32.740 --> 16:35.440
complaining that it's not her mother?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.640
What do you mean, I have no case?

16:39.650 --> 16:43.550
Well, Maureen, courts don't
intervene in failed romances.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.640
To give another person one's
love, that's everything, isn't it?

16:47.680 --> 16:53.970
It is, but when one enters into a love affair,
he or she assumes the risk of a broken heart.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.870
Can't you do anything?

16:55.880 --> 17:00.310
Because of what he did, I no
longer even believe in God.

17:01.050 --> 17:03.780
This just isn't fair.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.500
You no longer believe in God?

17:06.869 --> 17:10.099
No. How could I?

17:12.339 --> 17:14.990
Look, kids are raised
with the mind-set now…

17:15.030 --> 17:19.430
forget about love of learning,
it's get into the trophy college.

17:19.440 --> 17:24.880
All I ever hear about is how our kids don't
learn, how our education system is failing.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.510
It is.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.540
Getting the grade is
not the same as learning.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.670
In fact, sometimes
they're mutually exclusive.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.860
The kids have mastered test taking.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.720
It's memorization.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.120
They forget it as soon
as the exam's over.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.880
Moreover, the competition has
created a culture of cheating.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.760
It's all about getting the advantage.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.330
And it's every bit as bad
as Mrs Joseph suggests.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.930
What do we do about it?

17:45.940 --> 17:49.990
Well, in my thinking, it
does start with the parents.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.060
They see dad —now mom and dad—
competing in the workplace,

17:54.070 --> 17:58.426
maximizing career opportunities,
exploiting any edge they can get.

17:58.430 --> 18:02.000
We live in a society
that likes to keep score.

18:02.010 --> 18:03.570
It happens in life.

18:03.580 --> 18:08.992
It's going on in the home, and—and we
can't stop it from happening in the schools.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.510
How about not offering the AP courses?

18:12.520 --> 18:16.070
We do that, and the kids leave in droves
and find someplace that does offer them.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.410
Stress-management classes?

18:17.450 --> 18:18.210
We've got them.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.160
The kids don't have
time to schedule them in.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.690
Limiting the amount of
extracurricular activities?

18:22.730 --> 18:24.140
Well, it sounds good.

18:24.150 --> 18:28.480
Problem is, when it comes time apply to college,
our kids compete with kids from other schools.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.600
What you're suggesting is we take
away their ability to compete fairly.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.700
How do we do that? We
put a big sign saying,

18:33.740 --> 18:35.600
“if you want to go to
Harvard, don't enroll here”?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.630
Yes. It doesn't have to be Harvard.

18:37.670 --> 18:38.710
Tell that to the parents.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.390
Well, somebody's got
to take the lead here.

18:40.430 --> 18:41.100
How?

18:41.110 --> 18:43.060
Should we say, “don't aim for the top”?

18:43.100 --> 18:45.210
How about let's
redefine what the top is?

18:45.250 --> 18:48.210
But it's the kids who define it.

18:48.220 --> 18:54.820
Does getting into a select college mean they have
a better chance of achieving success or happiness?

18:55.690 --> 18:57.480
–No.
–Well…

18:57.490 --> 19:00.394
maybe you should start
by telling them that.

19:05.640 --> 19:09.130
Even assuming you really are
willing to go to jail on the forgery—

19:09.170 --> 19:12.370
If I can't afford my medications,
my lifespan gets pretty short.

19:12.410 --> 19:13.690
Prison doesn't really scare me.

19:13.730 --> 19:18.110
You'd be dead long before this could ever get to
trial, so why should we be scared of a lawsuit?

19:18.150 --> 19:19.810
His estate can sue for wrongful death.

19:19.850 --> 19:20.642
Oh, come on.

19:20.650 --> 19:24.400
Look, we make it possible for terminal
people to enjoy some quality of life.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.470
By betting on their death.

19:25.510 --> 19:26.940
You don't know my business, counsel.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.810
I will make it a point, sir, for
the jury to know your business.

19:29.850 --> 19:32.090
They will learn that your
industry is rife with corruption,

19:32.130 --> 19:34.420
that it's largely
unregulated by the SEC,

19:34.460 --> 19:39.610
That a grand jury indeed found
that up to 50% of viatical agreements
may indeed have be procured by fraud.

19:39.650 --> 19:41.980
–Look, you don't have— –And while
you entice investors by convincing them

19:42.020 --> 19:45.490
they're making a humanitarian
investment that will turn a huge profit,

19:45.530 --> 19:49.780
you currently have no fewer than 11 lawsuits
filed against you by these investors,

19:49.820 --> 19:52.340
who've yet to see any of the
giant returns you guaranteed.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.850
My investors have done
just fine, thank you.

19:54.890 --> 19:59.080
In the '80s perhaps, when
AIDS victims paid off by dying quickly.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.040
You bought my client's policy
when he was circling the drain.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.030
You made what you thought was a sure bet, and
now that it's turned out otherwise, you renege.

20:06.070 --> 20:07.550
You've breached a
contract, Mr Winthrop,

20:07.590 --> 20:10.830
and in so doing, have made it impossible
for my client to afford his medication.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.200
You very well may hasten
his death, but hey,

20:13.240 --> 20:16.780
I'm sure the jury will
find you quite sympathetic.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.390
Okay, that was good.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.200
Thank you.

20:22.210 --> 20:23.280
So where do we go from here?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.120
Well, hopefully they'll
make us an offer.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.950
I mean you and me.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.660
You got me all excited about
living another 40 years or so.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.330
Did I?

20:30.340 --> 20:33.560
If only I'd known getting
arrested could have such an upside.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.370
All the crimes I could have committed.

20:35.410 --> 20:40.620
Leo, I represent you, so it would
be extremely unethical to— for me to—

20:46.250 --> 20:47.810
to kiss you.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.440
So now you're in trouble.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.940
Big trouble.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.190
I better go.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.190
Uh, you'll call?

21:11.230 --> 21:12.250
What's wrong with you calling?

21:12.290 --> 21:14.710
No, I meant if we get an offer.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.270
I'll definitely be calling.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.100
Night, Leo.

21:19.550 --> 21:20.770
Night.

21:33.650 --> 21:35.320
Thank you for coming back.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.020
Reverend Joyner, I just
want to extend my apologies.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.190
It was wrong for my client to sue you.

21:40.230 --> 21:43.630
I must confess I hadn't properly
reviewed the facts, but now that I have,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.510
we'll be withdrawing
our claim forthwith.

21:45.550 --> 21:46.620
What?

21:46.630 --> 21:47.600
Is this a trick?

21:47.640 --> 21:51.740
No, it's not a trick, Ms Path. I quite properly
realized it shouldn't be Kurt who Maureen sues,

21:51.780 --> 21:53.390
but rather the church.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.090
What? Why?

21:55.100 --> 21:57.930
Well, your relationship
began with you as her pastor.

21:57.970 --> 21:59.780
You were acting as an
agent of the church.

21:59.820 --> 22:00.450
Nice try.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.080
You can't sue a church
for a broken heart, Twiggy.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.950
The claim would be loss of faith.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.270
The reverend has caused my
client to lose her faith in God.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.440
That's ridiculous.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.560
Is it now?

22:10.570 --> 22:12.210
I suspect not to Kurt.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.730
I had opportunity to read
several of his sermons,

22:14.770 --> 22:19.590
many of which eloquently convey
how love and faith are inextricably,

22:19.600 --> 22:21.920
indelibly woven together.

22:21.930 --> 22:26.390
“Whoever does not love does not
know God because God is love.”

22:26.400 --> 22:27.550
That's beautiful.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.290
Yes, we quite rightly will
be pursuing the church now.

22:30.330 --> 22:32.150
They're a much deeper
pocket, by the way.

22:32.190 --> 22:34.870
Oh, and thank you for
categorizing your feelings as lust.

22:34.910 --> 22:41.060
It will help with liability, though
I'm not sure your congregation will be
pleased to learn their pastor is a sinner.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.640
Look, maybe we can just settle this.

22:43.650 --> 22:44.990
No, we can't.

22:45.000 --> 22:45.890
Emma…

22:45.900 --> 22:47.820
I can't have the church
dragged into this.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.270
She's extorting you, Kurt.

22:49.310 --> 22:52.190
She's just trying to scare
you so you'll quit fighting.

22:52.230 --> 22:54.540
Is God a quitter?

22:54.550 --> 22:55.280
No.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.510
I need more conviction, Kurt.

22:56.550 --> 22:58.100
Is God a quitter?

22:58.110 --> 22:58.940
No.

22:58.950 --> 23:01.150
What would Jesus do, Kurt?

23:01.160 --> 23:02.340
He'd fight back.

23:02.350 --> 23:04.490
Jesus wasn't a baby, was he, Kurt?

23:04.530 --> 23:05.990
No.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.160
Jesus would get her.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.410
That's what he'd do.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.080
He'd get her.

23:11.370 --> 23:13.500
We're not settling.

23:17.450 --> 23:20.700
What kind of preposterous
nonsense is this?

23:20.710 --> 23:23.090
That's the kind of nonsense
we specialize in, judge.

23:23.130 --> 23:26.320
But as preposterous as it is,
these companies actually exist.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.930
They convert the remains
of people into diamonds.

23:28.970 --> 23:32.100
This firm, however, lost the
ashes of my client's mother,

23:32.140 --> 23:34.800
and instead proffered a cubic zirconium.

23:34.810 --> 23:35.570
It isn't right.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.370
I don't really care.

23:37.380 --> 23:42.080
Why should a court take up its
valuable time with something so…

23:42.090 --> 23:43.660
so… so—

23:43.670 --> 23:44.790
Because it matters, judge.

23:44.830 --> 23:47.380
Cases like this really do matter.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.500
Are you going to make me tell you why?

23:51.510 --> 23:53.160
Yes.

23:53.980 --> 23:55.670
Okay.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.580
I'm a great believer in capitalism.

24:01.590 --> 24:05.370
It fuels our competitive edge,
it's the lifeblood of our economy.

24:05.410 --> 24:10.500
But it also can bring out some
of our most disgusting tendencies.

24:10.510 --> 24:14.230
And nowhere are we more
exploitative, more disgusting,

24:14.240 --> 24:17.250
more soulless than we
are in the death business.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.720
Get them when they're grieving.

24:18.760 --> 24:24.080
Whether it's the solid mahogany coffin,
the choicest plot, the marble tombstone—

24:24.090 --> 24:28.520
if you truly loved a lost one, you
should pay through the nose to show it.

24:28.560 --> 24:34.980
And they come up with ingenious, creative new
ways to profit off grief, like these diamond rings.

24:35.230 --> 24:39.710
It's so easy to bilk people in
their weakest emotional states.

24:39.720 --> 24:44.550
They'll pay a higher price, they'll sign a misleading
contract, they won't scrutinize the fine print.

24:44.590 --> 24:49.820
My God, who first came up with,
“let's burn the bodies and sell urns”?

24:49.830 --> 24:55.350
The truth is, we are so desperate to hold
on to our loved ones, we'll do anything.

24:56.110 --> 25:01.160
My client sought to hold on
to her mother with a ring.

25:01.170 --> 25:07.030
They lost the ashes, they breached the contract,
then tried to defraud her with a cubic zirconium.

25:07.070 --> 25:12.480
And with that, I think our time
has come to take advantage of them.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.050
$750,000?

25:25.060 --> 25:25.840
I think we have to take it.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.030
And they'll waive the forgery charges?

25:27.070 --> 25:29.842
They will. You'll have
a cheque this week.

25:29.860 --> 25:32.530
What can I say? Marry me.

25:32.540 --> 25:35.800
Then half the money
would be mine, I suppose.

25:36.340 --> 25:39.010
You know, once this case is
over, I won't be a client anymore.

25:39.050 --> 25:40.210
No, you won't.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.630
You'll be free to do…

25:42.640 --> 25:44.130
whatever.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.450
I suppose I will.

25:51.340 --> 25:53.920
But… you shouldn't do it here.

25:59.410 --> 26:02.840
We've all heard the moans of the
modern-day high school teacher—

26:02.880 --> 26:05.240
“my kids aren't motivated,
they don't want to learn.”

26:05.280 --> 26:08.400
And that's real, but
we got another epidemic,

26:08.410 --> 26:12.530
especially in the middle-class,
upper-class and affluent schools.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.810
It's called teenage depression.

26:14.820 --> 26:17.360
A recent study at the centers
for disease control, found that

26:17.400 --> 26:22.840
17% of kids in grades 9 through 12
have seriously considered suicide.

26:22.850 --> 26:25.490
What? 17%?

26:25.500 --> 26:29.140
It is now the third leading
cause of death for teenagers.

26:29.180 --> 26:33.640
Some experts say drowsy driving
is as deadly as drunk driving.

26:33.650 --> 26:37.060
80% of teenagers today
are sleep deprived.

26:37.070 --> 26:41.710
This now, when we're learning that losing
sleep causes a multitude of medical issues,

26:41.750 --> 26:47.810
not just depression, but anxiety,
weakening of the immune system, ADHD.

26:47.820 --> 26:52.510
High-stress teens are twice as
likely to smoke, drink, use drugs.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.170
What the hell is going on?

26:54.210 --> 26:56.540
Our kids are overstressed, overscheduled

26:56.580 --> 27:00.300
because it's all about getting the
grade, getting into a good college.

27:00.340 --> 27:04.250
Oh, they're arriving at
college, by the way— fried.

27:04.260 --> 27:08.480
Princeton is now considering recommending
a gap year between high school and college

27:08.520 --> 27:13.860
because freshmen are showing up
burned out, in no condition to learn.

27:13.870 --> 27:17.650
Why in God's name do we have to
teach AP courses in high school?

27:17.690 --> 27:18.840
These are college courses.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.170
What ever happened to waiting for college?

27:21.210 --> 27:25.880
And the answer can't be, “we have to
offer them 'cause other schools are.”

27:25.920 --> 27:28.450
And for all the work those
stressed-out kids are doing,

27:28.490 --> 27:33.480
there's no correlation between happiness,
success and getting into the right school.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.870
None.

27:34.880 --> 27:40.960
Meanwhile, they're missing out
on fun, downtime, being  a teenager.

27:40.970 --> 27:43.810
It's taking a physical
and emotional toll.

27:43.820 --> 27:47.060
The neuroscience on multitasking
shows it hurts the brain.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.940
It dumbs us down.

27:48.950 --> 27:54.000
All this stuff our kids are doing
to get ahead is setting them back.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.900
Samantha Joseph ended up dead.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.500
This is a much bigger
picture than high school.

28:03.530 --> 28:06.050
It's our nation's power culture today.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.750
Do everything it takes to get ahead.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.380
The athletes take steroids,
the students pop adderall,

28:12.390 --> 28:14.910
our elected officials
engage in dirty politics—

28:14.950 --> 28:16.170
it's all about winning.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.800
And parents?

28:17.810 --> 28:19.820
They want their kids to win.

28:19.830 --> 28:22.530
There may be no correlation
between success and Harvard,

28:22.570 --> 28:25.910
but they want their kids to
wear the crimson just the same.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.200
They look at their friends'
kids, their neighbors' kids,

28:28.240 --> 28:34.440
and they want their own kids to be better
than, because we are a nation of winners.

28:36.820 --> 28:41.910
Samantha Joseph perhaps died in
part because she was doing too much,

28:41.920 --> 28:44.230
trying to succeed in
a competitive world.

28:44.270 --> 28:47.740
And yet ask any parent
what they want most,

28:47.750 --> 28:53.370
it's “prepare my teen to
succeed in a competitive world.”

29:11.860 --> 29:16.660
People today with AIDS
can live a long time, but…

29:17.000 --> 29:20.360
many more die quickly,
and it is not a fun death.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.140
Is death supposed to be fun?

29:22.180 --> 29:24.060
Love is.

29:24.460 --> 29:27.250
Have you considered,
if this worked out,

29:27.260 --> 29:32.910
you couldn't have a biological child
with him without risking AIDS
to both yourself and the baby?

29:32.950 --> 29:36.380
Might you let us have a single date
before counseling me on marriage?

29:36.420 --> 29:39.740
Relationships start with a single date.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.030
I'm not your mother,

29:44.040 --> 29:48.970
but since your parents are in England
and I'm the one that hired you,

29:50.060 --> 29:53.580
I would ask you to think
very carefully about this.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.140
Common sense can be an ugly
beast sometimes, can't it?

30:25.210 --> 30:26.890
Judas priest.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.330
Too patriotic?

30:28.340 --> 30:30.190
What a suck up.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.320
There's my little litigator man.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.910
So cute.
–Andrea.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.070
I couldn't stop thinking about
you and your big speech and—

30:41.110 --> 30:44.370
Andrea, by some miracle, the judge
ruled in our favor, which means,

30:44.410 --> 30:48.000
oh, joy, we get to keep
handling this megacase.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.680
Speaking of trials of the century.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.840
Clarence, Lorraine, please tell me
you got a settlement from the pastor.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.740
We're working on it.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.270
“Working on it.”

30:55.280 --> 30:56.400
Here she comes.

30:56.410 --> 30:58.700
I have truly wonderful news.

30:58.710 --> 31:02.090
After Kurt's disgusting behavior
yesterday, I confronted him.

31:02.130 --> 31:04.700
We got into a big fight, all
kinds of emotions poured out.

31:04.740 --> 31:07.850
Sum total—
he still loves me.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.090
We're back together.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.630
I'm dropping the suit.

31:10.640 --> 31:14.240
Thank you all so, so much.

31:17.270 --> 31:19.070
Oh, great!

31:19.080 --> 31:21.570
We came out of it with a thank-you.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.490
Golly gee.

31:29.790 --> 31:33.530
Okay, here's the deal—
you need serious help.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.270
That was a good thing that
just happened out there.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.070
Two people in love got back
together— that's a victory.

31:38.110 --> 31:40.960
The fact that you can't see past
the bottom line to appreciate that—

31:41.000 --> 31:42.960
you got a problem.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.920
I appreciate it when I fall in love.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.712
As for Maureen's bliss—
–Oh, wait. When was the last time that happened?

31:49.720 --> 31:51.020
That would be none of your business.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.280
Yes, it is my business, because
I want to go out with you.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.110
I'm barely just getting
out of a relationship.

31:56.150 --> 31:57.880
Oh, a faux relationship.

31:57.890 --> 32:00.910
We both know that. Even Shirley does.

32:02.010 --> 32:05.670
Aside from all of the sexually transmitted
diseases I'd be exposing myself to—

32:05.710 --> 32:07.340
Oh, that's funny.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.090
My sex is safe, partner.

32:09.100 --> 32:12.260
Oh, there I go, calling
you “partner” already.

32:12.740 --> 32:18.220
Okay, here's the deal— when I am not in a
relationship, I am prone to a few hollow thrills.

32:18.260 --> 32:23.410
But when I'm in one, I am
totally, unflinchingly monogamous.

32:24.190 --> 32:27.240
You need somebody like me.
You know you do.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.300
And you like me.

32:29.310 --> 32:32.800
Why else would you have
taken my stupid case?

32:33.690 --> 32:35.070
I think you need to leave now.

32:35.110 --> 32:35.970
I'm not leaving.

32:36.010 --> 32:39.772
–I'll call security.
–Go ahead. Tell 'em to bring backup.

32:44.360 --> 32:48.360
I read a book called “doing
school” by Denise Pope.

32:48.370 --> 32:50.010
I found it spot-on.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.590
Every parent should read it.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.480
Kids “do” school today.

32:53.490 --> 32:54.670
It's not about learning.

32:54.710 --> 32:58.330
It's piling up achievements that
look good on the college AP,

32:58.370 --> 33:01.260
and it's gotten way, way out of hand.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.510
And you know what as a
society get out of it?

33:03.550 --> 33:08.390
A nation of test takers, club
presidents and volleyball captains.

33:08.400 --> 33:13.590
But we're losing the
innovators, the free thinkers,

33:13.600 --> 33:15.410
the dreamers.

33:15.420 --> 33:21.470
We lose our values—
honesty, integrity, character.

33:22.060 --> 33:27.150
A bunch of outcome-oriented kids are
being led by outcome-oriented teachers

33:27.160 --> 33:29.850
who are pushed by goal-driven parents.

33:29.860 --> 33:33.980
And 20% of today's teenagers
experience depression,

33:33.990 --> 33:39.370
and a large percentage of them,
like Ms Rome says, attempt suicide.

33:40.390 --> 33:44.080
We need to get it together, fast.

33:44.490 --> 33:48.550
I feel the high school is more
likely in a better position

33:48.560 --> 33:51.480
to remedy this than the parents.

33:51.850 --> 33:55.220
I'm going to allow
this case to go forward.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.910
We're adjourned.

34:02.420 --> 34:05.080
Well, thank you.

34:05.090 --> 34:06.900
This is just the start, Carolyn.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.020
It figures to be a very long journey.

34:09.060 --> 34:12.429
Yes, yes, and I'm prepared to take it.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.969
Are you with me?

34:13.980 --> 34:15.969
I am.

34:23.739 --> 34:27.710
Okay, next up: Alan Shore,
you'll be rescuing Mr Crane.

34:27.719 --> 34:28.940
Oh, God help me.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.090
Okay, we ready?

34:30.100 --> 34:33.590
Maybe I could rescue him by
persuading him not to jump in.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.100
Go!

34:35.110 --> 34:37.389
Try not to drown me.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.550
Okay, Mr Shore, go.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.130
Not everybody can get in the water.
Somebody's got to drive the boat.

34:46.170 --> 34:49.070
I don't see why I couldn't
just drive the boat.

34:49.110 --> 34:51.830
–Go!
–Oh, dear.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.470
Get 'em out.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.780
We'll never get in now.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.830
Oh, shut up.

36:04.350 --> 36:06.340
Where's my money?

36:07.240 --> 36:08.730
I was in the
neighborhood and thought—

36:08.770 --> 36:09.950
well, actually, I wasn't
in the neighborhood.

36:09.990 --> 36:12.150
I had to fight like hell
through traffic to get here.

36:12.190 --> 36:14.620
But now that I am here…

36:16.890 --> 36:19.060
What?

36:19.070 --> 36:23.310
I spent a rather long
night of the practical soul.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.970
I don't fare very
well against practical.

36:32.540 --> 36:36.530
I don't think it would be a great idea
for me to fall in love with you, Leo.

36:36.570 --> 36:42.190
And I fear if I were to spend
time with you, I'd have no choice.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.620
I realize I'm guilty of a bigotry.

36:45.630 --> 36:50.150
But as bigotries go, one
of the more reasonable ones.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.480
You're an incredible man.

36:53.490 --> 36:55.330
I just…

36:55.340 --> 36:59.290
don't think I can go where
this would inevitably lead.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.810
Yeah, it was pretty selfish
of me to expect otherwise.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.820
–No, it's just––
–Katie…

37:15.530 --> 37:17.180
I get it.

37:41.190 --> 37:45.400
Um, Andrea was in
my office not long ago.

37:46.050 --> 37:51.450
She got down on one knee and
asked for permission to marry you.

37:53.050 --> 37:55.500
She'd be good for you, Carl.

37:55.510 --> 37:57.670
Hasn't even been a day yet,
and you're pimping me out.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.170
I'm jealous actually.

38:00.180 --> 38:03.090
But part of being
grown-up, I suppose—

38:03.100 --> 38:05.280
We just broke up, for God's sake.

38:05.290 --> 38:07.630
Nobody's that much a grown-up.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.880
I guess not, but…

38:10.890 --> 38:16.730
I agree with what you said, and I actually
do think Andrea would be great for you.

38:16.740 --> 38:22.030
And believe it or not, I
really do want you to be happy.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.280
She thinks I'm cute.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.190
You are cute, Carl.

38:31.200 --> 38:34.420
You are incredibly cute.

38:43.740 --> 38:45.900
I can still taste the
chlorine in my lungs.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.990
Oh, you're being a baby.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.540
It's gonna be on our military
record forever, you ow?

38:49.580 --> 38:53.280
–We can retake the test.
–I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.240
Oh, shut up.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.150
What's the big deal, anyway?
–It's a big deal.

38:57.190 --> 38:58.360
If you don't finish at
the top of your class,

38:58.400 --> 39:01.810
you don't make the short list for
officer material. You don't make officer—

39:01.850 --> 39:04.470
Well, aren't you just one
fat microcosm of society?

39:04.510 --> 39:06.550
Get ahead. This is just
like Whitney's case.

39:06.590 --> 39:09.270
All these high school kids––
–How do you know about Whitney's case?

39:09.310 --> 39:12.290
I know because I take time
out to talk to my neighbors.

39:12.330 --> 39:17.550
Maybe you should try that during
one of your sexual solicitations.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.258
Good night for a jump. You first.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.930
Oh, shut up.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.780
I'm sorry.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.710
I'm sorry I screwed up the…

39:35.720 --> 39:38.130
swim test.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.490
I don't like to fail.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.680
I won't even try something if I
think there's a risk of failure.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.240
–That's absurd.
–No, it isn't.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.130
We're Americans. We're
winners. That's our culture.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.790
We declare victory even if
we lose. That's who we are.

39:52.830 --> 39:56.230
Well, maybe we all need
to be a little more humble.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.140
I don't like fighting.

40:04.150 --> 40:06.550
Neither do I.

40:06.850 --> 40:10.180
It's not healthy to go
to bed angry at somebody.

40:10.830 --> 40:13.990
Especially when it's your best friend.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.390
Why don't we just get it over with?

40:35.690 --> 40:37.110
I feel better.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.780
So do I.

40:38.790 --> 40:40.400
Sleepover?

40:40.410 --> 40:41.850
I knew it.

40:41.860 --> 40:42.370
Forget it, Denny.

40:42.410 --> 40:44.100
One hug, right into the sack.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.040
I said forget it.

40:45.080 --> 40:48.420
It's not that I don't like them,
but they need to be special.

40:48.460 --> 40:52.180
If you have them all the time,
they lose their specialness.

40:52.220 --> 40:55.120
They're always special to me.

41:18.090 --> 41:20.320
Next time I'll eat something spicy.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.520
The gas will make me buoyant.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.850
They had to pull us to shore.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.190
You were gurgling.
–I wasn't.

41:28.230 --> 41:28.910
I heard it.

41:28.950 --> 41:30.670
IT was like two beached whales.

41:30.710 --> 41:31.810
Oh, we're pathetic.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.240
I thought you were
giving me the Heimlich.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.380
Oh, stop it.
