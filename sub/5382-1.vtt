03:05.818 --> 03:09.310
Hi. I'm Devin Villiers, M.D.

03:10.623 --> 03:14.218
I couldn't help noticing
your lovely necklace.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.990
And what's your area of specialty,
Dr. Villiers?

03:17.063 --> 03:18.621
I kill monkeys,

03:18.698 --> 03:22.395
as well as rats, gerbils,
the occasional potbellied pig,

03:22.468 --> 03:25.266
but mostly monkeys.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.735
- He means medical research, dear.
- Nope.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.436
I just like to kill monkeys.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.477
It's late. We should be going.
Good night, Doctor.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.947
- Good night.
- Yeah.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.011
Go easy on him tonight!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.174
What?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.650
Oh, my goodness.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.406
What do you want from me?

04:41.848 --> 04:43.645
Somebody please help me.

04:48.721 --> 04:51.485
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

04:51.557 --> 04:55.288
- I'm getting worse.
- I don't have it, swear to God.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.885
Don't fuck with me!

04:57.597 --> 04:59.531
Please, you gotta believe me!

05:04.470 --> 05:06.995
I need that buffer now, Devin.

05:07.073 --> 05:10.304
It's locked in a vault.
I can't get to it, nobody can.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.646
- Then make some more.
- No. No, not me.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.212
Then who? Who can make the buffer?

05:18.818 --> 05:21.184
Maggie! Maggie Dalton.

05:26.092 --> 05:29.528
She synthesized the compound,
did the research.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.756
Nobody else, just her.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.264
Maggie Dalton.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.970
Please, please let me go.

05:39.605 --> 05:43.803
Don't tell anyone I was here.
You never even saw me.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.503
No, no. God, no.

06:11.637 --> 06:12.831
But I saw you.

06:24.851 --> 06:28.252
Excuse me, there's a guy
in the bathroom, bleeding.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.481
Come on.

06:50.676 --> 06:51.904
Oh, shit.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.423
We need paramedics in here right away.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.467
How could we have let this slip by?

07:42.829 --> 07:43.818
Hey.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.191
- Sleeping on the job?
- Me? No.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.234
Just deep in thought.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.997
Yeah, 40 winks deep.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.761
What'd you find out?

07:53.840 --> 07:58.777
Well, they said he was pretty trashed,
committed some serious party fouls.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.777
Assume our suspect's covered in blood.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.615
How does he walk out of here unnoticed?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.050
And barefoot.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.188
Check it out.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.064
Death by cell phone.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.628
That's a first.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.832
- He popped the SIM card.
- So somebody's got his address book.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.740
- That can't be good.
- Nope.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.015
Excuse me, we're not finished in here.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.315
- My God!
- Excuse me, excuse me.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.119
I'm sorry, Detective.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.526
This man was one of my staff.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.188
I apologize. May I?

08:51.831 --> 08:55.824
I'm Dr. William Reisner,
of the Reisner Institute.

08:56.068 --> 08:59.094
- Think tank over in Redmond.
- Yes.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.006
And on occasion, we do more than think.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.942
- Any thoughts on this?
- We contract to the Pentagon, Detective.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.182
As I'm sure you can imagine,
we have a long list of enemies.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.049
Great, well, we'd love
to get a statement from you outside.

09:13.119 --> 09:16.850
- We'll be taking over from here.
- On whose authority?

09:16.923 --> 09:20.552
Well, I've cleared it with your superiors,
if that's what you mean.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.528
They clear you
to contaminate the crime scene, too?

09:29.335 --> 09:31.667
- Are we good now?
- Yeah, perfect.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.672
Let's make sure Forensics bags the hands,
I want to get a fingernail...

09:34.740 --> 09:37.800
- You all heard the Colonel.
- Yeah, I heard the Colonel.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.805
Let's let it go, Frank.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.281
- We're rolling over on this?
- It's not me.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.446
DOD's calling the shots on this one.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.955
Reisner's hooked in with the Pentagon.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.958
- You're letting them investigate themselves.
- Did I say I liked it?

09:54.026 --> 09:57.792
Come on, this isn't
Halliburton overcharging for unleaded, Tom.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.660
It's a murder case, they have no jurisdiction.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.256
Read the Patriot Act.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.736
- I need you to run a soft cover on this girl.
- Great.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.398
- Still letting us give out tickets, right?
- Yeah.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.703
She was the staff biologist
over at the Institute.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.108
- Reisner's concerned about her.
- Babysitting gig.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.507
Look, you're still on the case.

10:16.082 --> 10:19.574
Besides, she's got, like, eight diplomas,
you might learn something.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.712
- Look, Tom...
- We're done, Frank.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.512
Now get out of here,

10:26.926 --> 10:28.985
before my ulcer starts bleeding.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
What, were you guys born in a barn?

10:44.610 --> 10:48.410
- I guess I should've studied biology.
- Yeah, right?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.709
Great.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.655
Hello, Detectives.
Thank you for helping us out.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.549
Come in.

11:04.930 --> 11:05.919
Hey.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.157
- Hackles down.
- Yeah.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.436
This is Dr. Margaret Dalton.
Margaret, these are Detectives Turner and...

11:19.512 --> 11:22.379
- Martinez. We'll be taking the first shift.
- Great.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.911
How much danger do you think I'm in?

11:27.520 --> 11:32.389
Well, we don't know too many of the details,
Miss Dalton, we're just security.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.887
Well, my colleague was murdered,

11:37.963 --> 11:40.932
brutally, from what I've been able
to piece together.

11:41.967 --> 11:46.267
And honestly, I expected someone
more senior, more in the loop.

11:47.606 --> 11:51.337
The chief assures me
they're two of the finest on the force.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.068
You'll be fine, ma'am.

11:53.145 --> 11:56.410
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm sure you're entirely competent.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.679
Thanks.
Do you mind if we secure the premises?

11:59.752 --> 12:00.810
Go ahead.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.023
Good night, William.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.150
I'll check back in the morning.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.641
Well, I'll be upstairs.
Make yourselves comfortable.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.242
- Sorry, I was just gonna...
- I've gotta get that fixed.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.409
I got a 1920s bungalow.
Does the same thing.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.476
Creaks and groans like a ghost.

12:42.328 --> 12:45.422
- You check downstairs, I'll take up.
- I'm sure you will.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.899
- Okay, you take upstairs, I'll take down.
- No, no, go ahead, I'm fine.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.027
- You sure?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

12:51.103 --> 12:53.970
I like it down here
with the creaks and the groans.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.808
- You have any firearms in the house?
- No.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.941
Anyone else regularly use your place?
Friends, relatives?

13:05.017 --> 13:06.143
Nope.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.752
You don't have a housekeeper? Boyfriend?

13:09.088 --> 13:10.282
I have a cat.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.490
I'm a dog person, myself. This your office?

13:13.793 --> 13:14.851
Yeah.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.659
Mostly just some personal stuff.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.259
- Do you mind?
- No, no, not at all.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.446
Rainfall noise works for me.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.043
I need to check in there.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.880
I guess if you've got
any voyeuristic tendencies,

13:43.956 --> 13:44.980
this is a great job, huh?

13:45.057 --> 13:47.890
Don't worry,
we take pills for that sort of thing.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.559
My kid sister, Heather.
She's a freshman at U-Dub.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.636
Must be close.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.301
Or I'm overcompensating.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.979
We're done up here.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.565
What were you and Dr. Villiers working on?

14:38.177 --> 14:40.645
Do you discuss your cases with strangers?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.538
I'm still bound
by a non-disclosure agreement.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.677
- I couldn't tell you if I wanted to.
- What do you mean "still"?

14:47.753 --> 14:50.813
Well, I haven't worked there for six months.
I was let go.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.357
What do you do now?

14:52.925 --> 14:54.222
I'm unemployed.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.823
Quite an overhead you got.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.063
William Reisner
was an extremely gracious employer.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.831
- All secure downstairs, Frank.
- Great.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.370
Here's my cell phone number.
Put it on speed dial.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.598
We'll be right outside if you need us.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.938
One of us could stay inside
if you'd feel more comfortable.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.205
I'll be fine.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.513
I'd like to keep that door unlocked,
in case we need to get to you quickly.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.948
Is that standard?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.712
Well, it's a good idea.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.014
Okay, then.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.677
Okay, anyone with eight degrees
has no right to look like that.

15:45.744 --> 15:46.972
Like what?

15:47.046 --> 15:49.276
Oh, yeah, act like you didn't notice.

15:50.316 --> 15:53.444
She could probably melt concrete
with those blue eyes.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.248
They were green, actually.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.351
- Bell Ranger.
- Not one of ours.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.218
It's heading north.
I'll call it in anyway. N-7953?

16:07.299 --> 16:10.291
Lewis, it's Turner.
Get me an ID through Sea-Tac ATC.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.202
Non-police Bell Ranger, tail number N-7-9

16:13.272 --> 16:14.637
- 5-3.
...5-3.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.299
<i>- 7-9-5-3. Got it.</i>
- Okay.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.610
- Have fun.
- Okay.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.815
Hey, Frank.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.619
<i>Keep it down in there,</i>
<i>you're gonna disturb the neighbors.</i>

16:33.859 --> 16:37.317
<i>I'm sure they got better things to do</i>
<i>than listen to me hum.</i>

16:39.465 --> 16:42.298
You promise? I mean, really, really promise?

16:42.368 --> 16:46.361
- Don't worry.
- I swear, if you Paris me, I'm dead.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.099
My dad will kill me.

16:48.607 --> 16:52.441
- I mean it.
- Come on. You know I'd never do that.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.642
What if my parents come home early?

16:58.717 --> 17:01.982
My dad sometimes drives around the block
just to trick me.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.316
I'll go check.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.194
It's all good.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.691
Close the blinds, okay?

17:50.269 --> 17:51.361
All right.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.407
Now, play with yourself a little,
have some fun.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.966
- You sound like a porn director.
- You wish.

18:05.784 --> 18:06.978
Nice.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.892
<i>Hey, Frank, look in the mirror.</i>

18:17.229 --> 18:19.857
Your Arizona tan is officially gone.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.456
<i>You're one of us now.</i>

18:22.935 --> 18:24.800
Great, how'd that happen?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.402
I like it. It suits you.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.268
Oh, thanks.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.943
Shit.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.252
That's it.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.624
Come on, a little more.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.101
Nice.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.343
- That's it.
- Okay, your turn.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.009
<i>What've we got here?</i>

19:16.421 --> 19:18.252
Must be the sister, Heather.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.921
Hey. It's Heather, right?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.890
You look like a cop.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.197
What makes you say that?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.596
Your suit.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.865
Nobody would actually wear that.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.337
I'm Detective Martinez.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.673
She's dead, isn't she?

19:44.750 --> 19:47.548
At her computer,
suffocated under a pile of printouts.

19:47.619 --> 19:48.745
Nobody found the body for days,

19:48.820 --> 19:51.789
and now there's some
creepy bio-culture growing out of her nose.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.620
No, no, she's fine.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.526
Everything's fine.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.994
Means everything's not fine.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.566
Oh, yeah, she's a peach.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.837
Okay, I think I got it. Okay.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.808
Wait, just a sec.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.579
What are you doing?

20:25.657 --> 20:28.490
- I thought I saw someone.
- What?

20:29.394 --> 20:30.827
Ash, come on.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.920
There's nobody here.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.127
Let's play.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.430
What the hell is wrong with you?

20:43.308 --> 20:44.639
Someone's here.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.305
Ashley, there's nobody here. Nobody.

20:55.988 --> 20:56.977
Maggie!

20:57.689 --> 20:58.917
Oh, shit!

21:06.798 --> 21:10.199
Oh, Heather, I'm so sorry.
Something came up at the last minute.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.760
Yeah, I figured as much from the stakeout.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.032
It's just a precaution.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.308
Against unauthorized quality time
with your sister?

21:19.645 --> 21:21.078
It's a work thing.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.614
That non-disclosure shit
does not apply to me.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.673
There's nothing to worry about.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.652
- Go to the concert, take Chelsea...
- I already did.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.414
It's over.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.151
Listen, Heather, I'm really sorry.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.562
This is just a crazy time right now,
but it will be over soon, I promise.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.688
Right.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.688
Well, in the meantime,

21:41.767 --> 21:45.567
I'm gonna go shoot crystal and get pregnant
by some guy I barely know.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.507
No, you're not. Heather.

21:49.574 --> 21:53.135
And it wasn't a concert,
it was a poetry slam.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.752
Everything okay?

22:04.690 --> 22:05.748
Okay.

22:07.626 --> 22:08.718
Good night.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.522
Could you...

22:12.831 --> 22:15.026
Could you just make sure she's okay?

22:15.801 --> 22:16.927
You bet.

22:17.469 --> 22:18.458
Thanks.

23:04.616 --> 23:05.810
Hi, kitty.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.812
You want in? Yeah? Come on.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.451
Come on, kitty.

23:11.623 --> 23:12.681
Come on.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.322
Come on.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.057
Come on.

23:33.512 --> 23:34.740
There you go.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.161
- Turner.
<i>- I think I heard something.</i>

23:55.233 --> 23:57.667
Lisa just went inside, it's probably her.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.364
<i>Stay inside your study</i>
<i>until you hear from us.</i>

24:07.813 --> 24:10.111
Lisa, how's everything going in there?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.150
It all looks fine.
I'm just gonna check upstairs.

24:12.217 --> 24:15.880
Okay. Maggie's in her study,
make sure she knows everything's okay.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.723
Who's there?

24:57.796 --> 25:00.560
It's Detective Martinez, ma'am.
Stay in the room.

25:02.534 --> 25:03.592
<i>Lisa?</i>

25:05.637 --> 25:06.695
<i>Lisa.</i>

25:22.420 --> 25:23.478
Shit.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.000
Lisa!

25:55.353 --> 25:56.342
Shit.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.881
Come on, baby.
Come on, stay with me. Come on.

25:59.958 --> 26:00.982
Damn it.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.122
Oh, Jesus.

26:04.763 --> 26:05.821
Come on.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.126
- Stay inside.
- Does she have a pulse?

26:12.203 --> 26:14.797
- No.
- I'll do chest compressions. Breathe.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.605
- And one, and two, and three, and four...
- Come on, Lisa, breathe. Breathe.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.205
And one, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.884
- Breathe, damn it!
- Take over!

26:36.428 --> 26:39.420
One, two, three, four, five.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.021
Come on.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.029
Come on. Come on.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.569
- Detective.
- What?

26:45.637 --> 26:47.730
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.872
I'm sorry, there's no use.

26:58.083 --> 27:01.052
<i>- All units, all units in position.</i>
- Move, move, move!

27:01.353 --> 27:03.082
<i>Second team. Move into Bronco position.</i>

27:03.154 --> 27:04.781
<i>- Take around back.</i>
<i>- Roger that.</i>

27:04.856 --> 27:07.017
<i>Okay, watch your screens,</i>
<i>watch your screens.</i>

27:07.192 --> 27:09.217
Secure the perimeter!

27:09.794 --> 27:10.920
Watch the windows.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.054
Turner!

27:12.530 --> 27:13.519
Help!

27:14.332 --> 27:16.061
<i>Zulu Two, are we clear?</i>

27:17.802 --> 27:18.826
Maggie?

27:19.504 --> 27:20.698
- Maggie!
- Where is it?

27:20.772 --> 27:22.034
- I don't know.
- I know you have it.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.631
It's not here, but...

27:23.975 --> 27:26.307
<i>We got movement upstairs.</i>
<i>All units move into position.</i>

27:26.378 --> 27:27.777
<i>Keep your eyes on the screen!</i>

27:27.846 --> 27:30.781
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

27:30.849 --> 27:33.249
I heard you talking to him. Where is he?

27:34.219 --> 27:35.618
Get out of my way!

27:37.155 --> 27:38.383
<i>Get upstairs.</i>

27:38.490 --> 27:41.891
- Clear out the room, now! Move!
- Go!

27:50.101 --> 27:51.568
They're firing upstairs!

27:52.203 --> 27:53.192
<i>Negative.</i>

27:54.105 --> 27:55.129
<i>Report, report!</i>

27:55.206 --> 27:57.003
<i>Negative. Asserting perimeter.</i>

27:58.009 --> 28:00.307
<i>Civilians clearing through, hold fire.</i>

28:00.779 --> 28:03.543
- Did we get him?
- Still waiting on confirmation.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.310
- Rollins!
<i>- Had him, Colonel Bishop.</i>

28:05.383 --> 28:07.351
<i>- He was right here in front of us.</i>
- Bishop, what's happening?

28:07.419 --> 28:09.011
<i>- We'll get him.</i>
<i>- I got nothing on my screen.</i>

28:09.087 --> 28:10.111
<i>- Do you see?</i>
<i>- I can't see him!</i>

28:10.188 --> 28:11.177
William?

28:11.322 --> 28:14.257
This whole thing was a goddamn setup.
You used her as bait.

28:14.325 --> 28:17.385
Our tactics were necessary. I'm sorry.
Now clear out and let us do our job.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.192
I lost my partner in there,
you son of a bitch!

28:21.299 --> 28:22.823
Get out of here, now!

28:23.735 --> 28:24.759
<i>Repeat fire.</i>

28:24.836 --> 28:26.201
Grenade, grenade!

28:31.676 --> 28:33.405
What the hell's going on?

28:36.614 --> 28:38.343
<i>I can't see a goddamn thing!</i>

28:38.583 --> 28:39.607
<i>Sweep downstairs.</i>

28:39.684 --> 28:40.946
<i>I got him, I got him!</i>

28:41.019 --> 28:42.281
<i>Target! Take him out!</i>

28:55.266 --> 28:57.131
Go, go!

29:10.782 --> 29:11.771
Come on.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.208
Go, go!

29:24.062 --> 29:25.120
Fuck!

29:26.831 --> 29:29.664
Plummer! Watkins! We've lost containment.

29:30.034 --> 29:32.229
Get those Sky-Eyes off the dime.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.795
- Rollins! What the hell happened?
- We lost the subject, sir.

29:36.674 --> 29:38.266
All units, fall back!

29:49.954 --> 29:51.546
Okay, come on. Go, go!

30:03.268 --> 30:05.168
What the hell was that thing?

30:06.304 --> 30:08.295
What kind of biologist are you?

30:09.841 --> 30:11.274
My partner is dead.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.607
He wanted you. Not Lisa, you.
I want answers.

30:14.679 --> 30:17.239
Look, I don't know.

30:19.184 --> 30:22.711
I'm trying to understand this myself.
It doesn't make any sense.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.159
All right.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.393
We'll go to the station and regroup.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.461
No, you can't take me to the police,
you're a cop.

30:41.539 --> 30:44.269
- He'll know I'm there.
- You don't have a choice.

30:45.643 --> 30:46.667
- Let go!
- Turner.

30:46.744 --> 30:47.836
<i>Yeah, hey, dude, it's Lewis.</i>

30:47.912 --> 30:49.641
<i>- About your Bell Ranger...</i>
- I'm not going to the cops!

30:49.714 --> 30:51.739
<i>That tail number doesn't show up</i>
<i>in any of our databases.</i>

30:51.816 --> 30:53.408
<i>Maybe you should go get</i>
<i>your eyes checked, dude.</i>

30:53.484 --> 30:54.473
No shit.

30:58.489 --> 31:02.220
Bacon is murder.
That's right, people, bacon is murder.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.285
That's right! Breakfast kills.
Bacon is murder.

31:11.769 --> 31:12.793
Run!

31:19.978 --> 31:21.036
Excuse me!

31:21.880 --> 31:22.972
Keep going!

31:43.301 --> 31:45.963
This way! This way! This way!
Come on. Come on.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.979
I'm okay. Come on!

32:08.593 --> 32:09.582
Come on.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.533
Oh, shit.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.901
Oh, God.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.295
Oh, God.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.571
Oh, God.

33:41.152 --> 33:42.517
Good Christ.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.492
Yeah, he just walked in.
Listen, I gotta call you back.

34:34.772 --> 34:37.103
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:40.277 --> 34:44.271
We're all pretty shaken up around here.
She was a good cop, Frank.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.581
Well, she was a little more than that.

34:47.652 --> 34:51.018
Dr. Dalton, can I get you anything?
Some water, coffee?

34:51.089 --> 34:54.991
I need a laptop, a secure landline,
and some privacy would be helpful.

34:57.395 --> 35:01.058
- Can I talk to you outside for a second?
- Yeah. Excuse us.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.439
These guys are fucking with us,
they know who did this.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.409
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

35:13.478 --> 35:15.241
Well, give the command, we'll go after him.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.508
I got 100 cops that wanna hit the streets,

35:17.582 --> 35:19.174
and run that shitbag down.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.684
But my orders are to hold them back,
and that means you, too.

35:21.752 --> 35:23.879
What orders? Whose orders, theirs?

35:24.589 --> 35:26.921
I know all about taking bad orders, Tom.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.856
Well, keep your personal beefs
out of this, Frank.

35:28.926 --> 35:30.325
I'm not asking you to plant evidence.

35:30.394 --> 35:32.259
When did you start bending over
for the big boys?

35:32.330 --> 35:34.764
- I don't even recognize you anymore.
- You did what you could.

35:34.832 --> 35:37.699
- Now I need you to walk away.
- Walk away from what?

35:39.370 --> 35:40.860
Walk away from what?

35:42.807 --> 35:46.743
- You know what's out there, don't you?
- I know enough to leave it alone.

35:47.245 --> 35:51.978
Look, we hold her till the Feds get here,
we transfer custody, and we're home free.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.006
Yeah.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.817
Another case cleared, right?

36:05.630 --> 36:08.463
- We're moving you to a holding cell.
- I'm sorry?

36:08.733 --> 36:10.633
Just till the Feds get here.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.130
The Feds?

36:13.738 --> 36:15.467
It's for your own safety.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.481
All right, guys, she's all yours.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.021
This way.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.526
You might wanna use the restroom
before you go in there.

37:19.604 --> 37:22.664
Those holding cell toilets
can get pretty nasty, right?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.973
- It's over there. You want me to take her?
- Sure.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.818
Keep walking. You heard me, go.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.918
Now! Fast. Second floor.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.818
We'll be right outside, don't try anything.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.410
Is that right?

38:13.658 --> 38:15.285
- Hey, Chesley?
- Yeah?

38:16.761 --> 38:19.457
You mind watching the head?
I gotta run back upstairs.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.829
- You go on, then. We'll take it from here.
- Thanks.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.695
This way, this way. Come on.

39:43.414 --> 39:46.781
- Why are you helping me?
- I wanna know why Lisa died. Now.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.637
What are you doing?

40:08.906 --> 40:09.998
Frank!

40:10.708 --> 40:13.506
Tell me everything you know,
or we're going back.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.947
- I can't go back there!
- But I can.

40:19.450 --> 40:20.747
It's your call.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.422
Okay, okay! Okay.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.063
Here, put that on.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.565
- What's happening?
- Get out.

40:46.043 --> 40:49.410
<i>Look, he's just a cop, for Christ's sake.</i>
<i>Get me a fix on him now.</i>

40:49.480 --> 40:51.243
We've got a 90-degree swing
around the lake.

40:51.315 --> 40:52.907
There's no bridge, until here.

40:52.983 --> 40:54.883
Which would put them
in this general vicinity.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.614
If Turner gets Dalton to talk, it's over.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.487
- For all of us.
- He won't, that's a promise.

41:00.558 --> 41:04.050
<i>Seattle patrol unit has found a Mustang</i>
<i>abandoned near Union Bay.</i>

41:04.128 --> 41:07.894
Put Turner out over the Net,
and get his picture to the local TV stations.

41:07.965 --> 41:08.989
Yes, sir.

41:10.568 --> 41:13.935
How does someone like that
just slip out of our hands?

41:14.004 --> 41:15.904
You've really outdone yourselves this time.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.669
Usually when you people make a mess,
at least you can see it.

41:18.742 --> 41:19.800
Thanks.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.577
Get down!

41:32.356 --> 41:35.348
<i>We need assistance setting up a roadblock</i>
<i>at the 5th Street Bridge.</i>

41:35.426 --> 41:37.121
<i>Unit 23, please respond.</i>

41:40.331 --> 41:42.458
Okay. Come on. Get in, get in.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.469
- What are we doing?
- We gotta keep moving.

41:53.544 --> 41:56.138
If we stay in one place,
the cops will catch us.

41:56.213 --> 41:57.703
This is some rescue.

41:58.382 --> 42:01.317
I'm not doing this for you.
I need information.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.123
Okay, start talking.

42:22.606 --> 42:25.200
Five years ago,
a team of molecular biologists

42:25.276 --> 42:27.574
broke the code for human invisibility.

42:27.778 --> 42:30.338
But the program was scrapped,
almost overnight.

42:30.414 --> 42:31.438
Why?

42:31.515 --> 42:34.006
All but two of the first team were killed.

42:34.118 --> 42:36.109
Something went seriously wrong.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.582
A year later, Reisner started up again
with covert funding from the DOD.

42:41.659 --> 42:45.117
The operation was codenamed
Silent Knight, with a "K."

42:45.195 --> 42:46.253
Cute.

42:47.364 --> 42:51.630
The idea was to create
the ultimate national security weapon,

42:51.702 --> 42:53.363
an undetectable soldier.

42:54.805 --> 42:57.831
Reisner managed to reproduce
the original test results.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.536
Then he called me in to correct the defects.

43:00.945 --> 43:03.914
There's a flaw in the invisibility code.

43:03.981 --> 43:07.917
The serum turns human tissue invisible,
but it also has horrible side effects.

43:07.985 --> 43:11.648
Simply put, the serum allows
light to pass directly through us...

43:11.722 --> 43:13.986
- I was there, I believe you.
- Okay, but the radiation...

43:14.058 --> 43:16.993
- Just tell me about the guy.
- It damages your cells.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.086
- Over time, it kills them.
- Skip the science lecture.

43:19.163 --> 43:21.688
Just tell me about him, and make it simple.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.189
Okay.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.703
Dying test subjects, not good.

43:29.073 --> 43:32.702
So I developed a compound
called "the buffer," to keep him alive.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.778
His name was Michael Griffin.

43:37.214 --> 43:40.877
He was Special Forces.
He'd been in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.819
How do you feel?

43:46.724 --> 43:49.750
I feel like I'm about to blast off. I feel ready.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.833
Thanks, Doc, for this opportunity.

44:00.404 --> 44:02.065
What's your name?

44:03.841 --> 44:05.604
Dr. Dalton. Maggie.

44:07.344 --> 44:08.538
Maggie.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.509
Take good care of me, Maggie.

44:16.620 --> 44:19.919
- How's he doing?
- Blood pressure normal, heart rate normal.

44:19.990 --> 44:23.357
Galvanic skin response shows low stress.

44:23.427 --> 44:24.917
He's smiling.

44:29.033 --> 44:30.557
Let's do this.

45:26.090 --> 45:28.558
Reisner told me our test went well.

45:28.726 --> 45:32.526
But when they gave him the buffer
a few days later, he suddenly died.

45:32.596 --> 45:34.860
Somehow the buffer had failed.

45:36.767 --> 45:38.894
<i>Of course, I blamed myself.</i>

45:39.937 --> 45:41.404
<i>I couldn't see the truth.</i>

45:41.805 --> 45:45.571
Reisner let me go, but I couldn't let go.

45:46.910 --> 45:50.004
I had to know why the buffer failed.

45:52.049 --> 45:54.017
And tonight I found out.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.620
The buffer didn't fail.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.714
They never gave it to him.

46:04.995 --> 46:07.828
It was all about making the world
a safer place.

46:08.031 --> 46:09.896
Yeah. Nice job.

46:22.246 --> 46:25.409
<i>Tell Command there are checkpoints</i>
<i>at every bridge and road out of the city.</i>

46:25.482 --> 46:28.974
<i>If Turner and Dalton</i>
<i>try to leave Seattle tonight, we'll catch them.</i>

46:30.154 --> 46:32.918
It's not just the cop we have to worry about,
you realize that.

46:32.990 --> 46:35.925
You've got an invisible assassin out there
fighting his own war.

46:35.993 --> 46:38.120
- And I'll bring him in.
- You've lost control of him.

46:38.195 --> 46:40.755
Griffin's always operated
on the edge of anarchy.

46:40.831 --> 46:43.493
When he goes into combat, he goes deep,
he goes black.

46:43.567 --> 46:45.398
So why the hell would he listen to you?

46:45.469 --> 46:47.903
He's still a soldier, and I'm still his CO.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.201
Griffin cannot get the buffer.

46:51.208 --> 46:52.869
It's that simple.

46:53.110 --> 46:55.704
Now you find him, and end it.

46:55.779 --> 46:58.339
Like I said, he won't get to Dalton.

46:59.082 --> 47:02.609
Nothing happens to her.
Nothing that involves me.

47:04.087 --> 47:06.555
- Are we clear?
- We are.

47:08.692 --> 47:10.057
Wait here.

47:56.073 --> 47:59.167
<i>You have nine new messages.</i>
<i>To listen to your...</i>

47:59.877 --> 48:02.505
<i>Jesus, I saw it on TV. Where are you?</i>

48:13.857 --> 48:17.054
Does the ferry to Edmonds
still run at this hour?

48:19.263 --> 48:20.753
I don't know.

48:21.305 --> 48:27.392
