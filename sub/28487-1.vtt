00:55.856 --> 00:59.418
Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name,

00:59.420 --> 01:02.131
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

01:02.133 --> 01:04.245
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:04.247 --> 01:06.570
Give us this day our daily bread

01:06.572 --> 01:08.724
and forgive us our trespasses as we...

03:41.710 --> 03:43.228
Hey Crystal.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.348
Hey, what's up, Lump?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.181
Ah, nothing much.

03:46.183 --> 03:47.016
Same old shit.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.550
How's business?

03:51.500 --> 03:52.440
Pretty dead.

03:55.551 --> 03:56.801
What have you been doing?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.918
Just skatin' around all day.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.808
Got a bad sunburn, though.

04:01.810 --> 04:05.190
Jesus, you better take
better care of yourself.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.238
You need to wear long sleeves.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.558
I am now.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.640
Kinda too late.

04:15.570 --> 04:16.970
You could tell my fortune.

04:18.410 --> 04:19.618
Got a dollar?

04:19.620 --> 04:20.968
No.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.463
Can I borrow a dollar?

04:22.465 --> 04:23.665
I don't have a dollar.

04:24.810 --> 04:25.643
I can owe ya.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.938
You're fucked.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.488
Thanks.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.571
You see what this is?

04:36.573 --> 04:37.404
No.

04:37.406 --> 04:39.274
That's your best
friend status going down.

04:40.690 --> 04:43.678
I didn't know I had
a best friend status.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.513
For now.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.270
So what you doin' tonight?

04:49.345 --> 04:50.368
I don't know.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.925
Hang out in the park or something.

04:52.927 --> 04:55.508
You know, I saw this really cool place.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.358
It's a factory, a warehouse or something

04:58.360 --> 05:01.408
and I think it's abandoned 'cause I've

05:01.410 --> 05:02.668
been by it a couple of times and I've

05:02.670 --> 05:05.280
never seen anybody come in or out of it.

05:07.130 --> 05:10.310
It's kinda big and um, I don't know.

05:10.312 --> 05:11.915
I think it'd be fun.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.473
What is there to do there?

05:17.383 --> 05:18.214
I don't know.

05:18.216 --> 05:20.799
What's there to do in the park?

05:23.121 --> 05:25.450
Well, I mean, we could go check it out.

05:26.981 --> 05:27.814
Sure.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.850
Are you serious?

05:32.810 --> 05:34.230
Yeah, why not?

05:35.380 --> 05:37.158
Do you wanna go now?

05:37.160 --> 05:40.550
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.738
Well, I don't know
how we're gonna get in.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.440
I'm sure there's a way.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.318
So, he's like, what's your name?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.318
And I'm like, my friends call me Spaz

05:59.320 --> 06:01.128
and he goes well, what
does your mother call you?

06:01.130 --> 06:02.838
And I said dude, my
mother doesn't call me,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.638
but your mother calls
me Sweet Dick William

06:04.640 --> 06:06.691
faggot cock sucker.

06:06.693 --> 06:09.148
So then what happened?

06:09.150 --> 06:09.981
And then what happened?

06:09.983 --> 06:12.278
Bam, KO baby, knocked his ass out.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.420
Left him bleeding on the floor.

06:14.422 --> 06:16.056
That's fuckin' ill!

06:16.058 --> 06:18.321
Why don't you tell
her how that story ends?

06:18.323 --> 06:21.958
Dude, assaulting an officer, six months.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.793
That Crystal?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.216
Yo, Crystal!

06:29.408 --> 06:30.239
What's up, Crystal?

06:30.241 --> 06:31.208
How you doin' beautiful?

06:31.210 --> 06:32.768
What's up Lump?

06:32.770 --> 06:34.468
Hey, what's up Spaz?

06:34.470 --> 06:35.301
Hi Marcus.

06:35.303 --> 06:37.146
What's up Crystal?

06:37.148 --> 06:38.984
Those headaches any better?

06:38.986 --> 06:41.130
Comes and goes, you know.

06:42.887 --> 06:44.388
Crystal?

06:44.390 --> 06:45.908
Crystal this is Tammy.

06:45.910 --> 06:47.108
Tammy this is Crystal.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.443
Hi.

06:48.445 --> 06:49.320
Yeah, whatever.

06:50.367 --> 06:51.534
That's Lump.

06:53.638 --> 06:55.640
What's that shit on your neck?

06:58.370 --> 07:00.259
So where are you two headed?

07:00.261 --> 07:01.092
We're going to a...

07:01.094 --> 07:02.410
We're just going for a walk.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.018
I smell a coverup.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.798
Anybody else smell a coverup?

07:08.800 --> 07:09.638
Don't be an asshole.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.471
Who's being an asshole?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.158
I just asked them where they were going.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.658
I was just gonna take
her to a place that I know.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.177
New place?

07:16.179 --> 07:17.692
you didn't invite us?

07:17.694 --> 07:18.898
Come on.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.552
Got some beer and Marcus
has got some weed.

07:25.120 --> 07:25.951
Well.

07:25.953 --> 07:27.400
Alright, party at Lump's.

07:30.340 --> 07:33.130
Well, is that gonna be alright?

07:34.850 --> 07:37.521
I don't know, I just don't want

07:37.523 --> 07:39.600
too many people over there, you know?

07:41.343 --> 07:42.493
We're gonna get busted.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.740
Nobody's gonna get busted.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.440
Taco slappers.

07:53.290 --> 07:54.190
Hey Spaz.

07:59.881 --> 08:01.808
What's going on everybody?

08:01.810 --> 08:03.000
What's up, Crystal?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.180
Nothing much.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.308
What's up Liz?

08:08.310 --> 08:10.138
Share with your friend.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.608
What's going on, Melanie?

08:11.610 --> 08:14.440
So when are gonna drop this
dike and take on a real man?

08:15.390 --> 08:16.448
Why?

08:16.450 --> 08:17.283
You know any?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.428
Shit, ask Liz.

08:19.430 --> 08:20.848
She knows what kinda meat I'm packing.

08:20.850 --> 08:22.888
In your dreams, needledick.

08:22.890 --> 08:24.478
Hey, when I get a hard on, I don't have

08:24.480 --> 08:26.516
enough skin left over to blink my eyes.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.198
Fuck, I thought it was a pube

08:29.200 --> 08:30.530
'til I saw you taking a piss.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.857
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

08:37.860 --> 08:39.280
especially fuck you.

08:40.212 --> 08:41.044
Ugh.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.130
So where you going?

09:27.960 --> 09:30.293
Wondrous, isn't it?

09:32.693 --> 09:34.508
This is the place?

09:34.510 --> 09:35.538
Yeah.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.940
It's a fuckin' death trap.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.960
It's pretty freaky.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.008
I think it's cool.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.010
This is fucking awesome is what it is.

09:44.950 --> 09:48.348
So, how we gettin' in here, boss?

09:48.350 --> 09:49.968
Well, there's a window around back.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.430
I think we can get in there.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.928
We shouldn't go in there.

09:59.930 --> 10:00.763
Why not?

10:02.280 --> 10:03.560
I have a bad feeling.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.758
Come on, we've got
whiskey, we've got beer.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.790
We got weed.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.510
Marcus, are you coming?

10:49.570 --> 10:51.578
So, what's the deal?

10:51.580 --> 10:53.318
We're gonna take this
dumpster, put it underneath it,

10:53.320 --> 10:55.718
pile the shit on top and climb in.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.560
Sounds good.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.818
First things first, though,

10:58.820 --> 11:00.420
we need to take out this window.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.528
Okay, Liz, you go take
lookout on that corner.

11:12.530 --> 11:14.530
Melanie, you go take lookout down there.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.360
What's wrong with you?

11:22.298 --> 11:23.747
I'm alright.

11:23.749 --> 11:26.332
Well, you don't look alright.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.410
Good shot, Lump.

11:42.278 --> 11:44.018
Hey, this bitch is freaking out.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.658
Five oh!

11:51.350 --> 11:52.900
Get up, we gotta go.

11:58.207 --> 11:59.038
We shouldn't go in there.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.969
Shh.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.853
Marcus, you got any shit on you?

12:03.855 --> 12:06.282
We shouldn't go in there!

14:04.013 --> 14:04.986
Is she alright?

14:04.988 --> 14:07.548
How the fuck should I know?

14:07.550 --> 14:08.688
She's still breathing.

14:08.690 --> 14:11.198
That fucking cop is
gonna come back here again.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.988
Okay, so what
are we gonna do now?

14:12.990 --> 14:14.168
We're going in.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.198
Crystal said we shouldn't go in there.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.048
We've got alcohol,
drugs, a passed-out girl

14:19.050 --> 14:20.458
and there's a cop going around the block.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.808
What are we supposed to do?

14:21.810 --> 14:23.838
Okay, well, what about her?

14:23.840 --> 14:26.218
I'll go in first and
find some rope or something

14:26.220 --> 14:27.820
and you can help me pull her up.

14:29.940 --> 14:30.990
Are you serious?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.133
Yeah.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.395
Crystal, wake up.

14:41.397 --> 14:42.814
Crystal, Crystal.

14:45.939 --> 14:47.272
Wake up Crystal.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.328
Are we inside yet?

14:53.330 --> 14:54.163
No shit.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.768
No you don't, no.

14:58.770 --> 14:59.603
Are you okay?

15:01.750 --> 15:02.828
Yeah.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.338
What's your problem?

15:04.340 --> 15:06.011
Why don't you
just shut the fuck up?

15:06.013 --> 15:06.844
What?

15:06.846 --> 15:09.468
Shut the fuck up.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.650
Oh hell no.

15:12.410 --> 15:13.470
Hey guys.

15:14.350 --> 15:15.730
Come check this out.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.318
Are you sure you're okay?

15:19.320 --> 15:21.690
Yeah, I'm okay.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.938
You know, we should just go.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.330
Well, we're inside now.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.628
Well, what do you want to do?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.098
Come on, let's check the place out.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.010
It looks cool.

15:39.830 --> 15:40.663
Marcus!

15:44.980 --> 15:45.840
Are you coming?

15:50.743 --> 15:51.576
Yeah.

16:44.909 --> 16:47.598
What are you doing?

16:47.600 --> 16:50.933
We're gonna go exploring bwa ha ha ha.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.234
Oh, this is so cool.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.348
Oh, yeah.

20:33.989 --> 20:37.957
That last one, and then
Monica said that Phillip's...

20:37.959 --> 20:39.400
They never
wanted to have a kid.

20:39.402 --> 20:40.538
I don't know why they had one.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.371
Why?

20:41.373 --> 20:42.204
Phillip's going to leave.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.215
They never gave a crap about me.

20:44.217 --> 20:45.708
Why?

20:45.710 --> 20:47.030
'Cause he's
been drinking too much.

20:47.032 --> 20:49.802
But, whatever.

20:49.804 --> 20:52.898
I mean, I didn't give a crap
about them either, so...

20:52.900 --> 20:54.078
You know he
always used to drink a lot

20:54.080 --> 20:54.911
when he was around us...

20:54.913 --> 20:55.744
I just wanted
to get out of there

20:55.746 --> 20:57.105
quick as I could.

20:58.740 --> 21:00.348
I left when I was 16.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.054
Well, how long
are you going away for?

21:07.025 --> 21:08.728
No, no.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.460
One kid and my parents were done.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.778
So I ran into Andy the other day

21:13.780 --> 21:17.300
and he said that we could
use his garage for practice.

21:18.160 --> 21:18.993
Oh, yeah?

21:20.050 --> 21:21.828
What are you looking at?

21:21.830 --> 21:22.980
No one, nothing.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.220
Why do you keep staring at Crystal?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.650
I am not staring at Crystal.

21:41.510 --> 21:43.668
So anyway, what about you?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.040
What about your folks?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.473
Well...

21:51.460 --> 21:53.690
My dad left when I was eight years old.

21:55.197 --> 21:56.028
Oh yeah?

21:56.030 --> 21:56.863
What happened?

22:01.620 --> 22:04.010
You know those headaches that I get?

22:05.260 --> 22:06.093
Yeah.

22:07.230 --> 22:08.061
Well...

22:08.063 --> 22:10.538
I saw how you two were dancing together.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.858
We were just having some fun.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.338
You could've joined us.

22:14.340 --> 22:15.660
Like I'd wanna join you.

22:16.570 --> 22:19.318
Why can't you just act
like you're my girlfriend?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.870
I do act like I'm your girlfriend.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.399
Hey.

22:28.234 --> 22:29.065
What?

22:29.067 --> 22:29.898
You got any beer?

22:29.900 --> 22:30.731
No.

22:30.733 --> 22:35.408
I had a really bad
feeling that something

22:35.410 --> 22:38.310
bad was going to happen to
our neighbor, Mrs. Dixon,

22:40.090 --> 22:44.970
and when my mom came back, I told her and

22:46.340 --> 22:47.440
she didn't believe me.

22:48.620 --> 22:50.898
Hey, hey.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.570
You got any weed?

22:52.572 --> 22:53.718
No.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.553
Oh.

22:55.750 --> 22:59.408
Liz, I came here with you.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.980
I'm gonna leave here with you.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.340
Every time we go to a
party, or we have a party...

23:05.342 --> 23:06.173
Oh, Jesus, not again.

23:06.175 --> 23:07.498
You just have to flirt
with everyone else.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.798
It's really irritating.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.178
Dude, where's my fucking beer?

23:10.180 --> 23:12.734
Cock sucker, get lost man.

23:13.814 --> 23:15.600
Fuck you.

23:15.602 --> 23:19.102
Can't believe nobody has any fucking beer!

23:23.355 --> 23:24.700
Mrs. Dixon had died.

23:26.624 --> 23:28.780
She was strangled by her boyfriend.

23:33.930 --> 23:35.880
Everything kinda fell apart after that.

23:38.230 --> 23:39.838
Every time that I even hang out

23:39.840 --> 23:42.040
with anybody else you freak out.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.678
Why do have to flirt with Crystal?

23:44.680 --> 23:47.158
I just think she's a
cool chick, that is all.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.128
Why don't you fuck her, then?

23:49.130 --> 23:49.980
Liz.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.670
Now every time I have a headache,

23:58.990 --> 24:00.170
I get really scared.

24:07.210 --> 24:08.890
Tonight was a fun night, right?

24:10.640 --> 24:11.473
Yeah.

24:13.740 --> 24:15.050
So far, at least.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.088
How you doin'?

24:24.090 --> 24:25.478
Alright, how are you?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.858
I'm good.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.280
Sick of this shit.

24:29.490 --> 24:31.368
What's up with Marcus and Crystal?

24:31.370 --> 24:32.808
How the hell should I know?

24:32.810 --> 24:33.868
Look at them.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.288
It's pretty disgusting.

24:35.290 --> 24:36.908
Yeah, that bitch needs to go back

24:36.910 --> 24:38.378
to the box she came from.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.188
Yeah, she's really dirty.

24:40.190 --> 24:41.850
Yeah, stank ass bitch.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.508
So, what's up with you and Melanie?

24:45.510 --> 24:46.343
Nothing.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.500
What's up with you and Marcus?

24:50.970 --> 24:53.719
Nothing going on anymore.

24:53.721 --> 24:54.554
Good.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.868
Fuck this.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.118
Fuck you.

25:01.120 --> 25:01.953
Yeah.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.398
Let's get outta here.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
Sounds good to me.

25:16.570 --> 25:18.478
Fuck you too, asshole.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.478
Oh, and honey, I hope
you like a soft serve,

25:20.480 --> 25:23.080
'cause he ain't got nothing
but a fuckin' limp dick.

25:45.966 --> 25:47.608
You see?

25:47.610 --> 25:49.510
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.100
You see what a bitch she is?

26:18.432 --> 26:19.765
Fucking bitch.

26:50.466 --> 26:51.299
Oh, shit.

27:18.829 --> 27:22.038
We should not have let her
go downstairs by herself.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.886
She'll be fine.

27:32.130 --> 27:34.338
There's somebody in here with us.

27:34.340 --> 27:36.630
Who is totally passed out.

27:38.170 --> 27:39.470
Somebody else.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.868
You're not
gonna start freaking out

27:43.870 --> 27:44.920
on me again, are you?

27:47.534 --> 27:48.367
No.

27:49.862 --> 27:51.730
Do you want to do this, or not?

27:53.870 --> 27:54.703
Yeah.

28:03.930 --> 28:04.763
Bonus.

28:08.430 --> 28:09.263
Shit.

28:11.593 --> 28:12.700
Where the fuck is it?

28:16.212 --> 28:17.951
Here we go.

28:26.370 --> 28:27.290
Liz?

28:29.210 --> 28:30.043
Is that you?

28:34.930 --> 28:38.110
Spaz, this isn't funny.

28:42.589 --> 28:43.422
Oh shit!

31:46.995 --> 31:48.938
Where are you going?

31:48.940 --> 31:50.728
I've got to go find Melanie.

31:50.730 --> 31:52.240
But I thought we...

31:53.649 --> 31:54.528
Would you hurry up?

31:54.530 --> 31:56.058
Everything is fine, okay?

31:56.060 --> 31:57.601
Just calm down.

31:57.603 --> 31:59.128
What the fuck is going on?

31:59.130 --> 32:00.656
It was fun.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.718
We heard Melanie scream.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.848
What the fuck is going on here?

32:11.850 --> 32:12.748
Where's Melanie?

32:12.750 --> 32:14.118
Where's Tammy?

32:14.120 --> 32:15.328
We heard her scream.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.808
She's downstairs, he's got her.

32:16.810 --> 32:17.708
We've got to find her.

32:17.710 --> 32:18.541
Who?

32:18.543 --> 32:20.008
Is Tammy in there?

32:20.010 --> 32:21.518
We've got to find her and
get the hell outta here.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.558
What, somebody startin' trouble?

32:24.560 --> 32:26.018
Crystal's just fucked up again.

32:26.020 --> 32:26.940
Where's Tammy?

32:33.870 --> 32:34.703
Look.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.958
There's someone in here.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.930
He's got Melanie.

32:39.770 --> 32:41.958
We've gotta find her and
get the hell outta here.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.457
What are you talking about?

32:43.459 --> 32:46.464
Where's Melanie?

32:46.466 --> 32:50.365
What are you guys doing in here?

32:56.530 --> 32:57.740
We have to find her.

33:07.321 --> 33:08.258
Ah!

33:08.260 --> 33:09.093
Fuck!

33:10.040 --> 33:12.140
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

33:15.700 --> 33:16.998
Alright.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.460
Let's go find Melanie.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.051
What's going on?

33:25.053 --> 33:26.375
Somebody tell me what's going on.

33:26.377 --> 33:27.912
What are we doing?

33:27.914 --> 33:30.831
They heard Melanie scream.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.467
Dude, it was probably a rat.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.011
She doesn't need all six
of us looking for her.

33:35.013 --> 33:35.844
It wasn't a rat.

33:35.846 --> 33:36.677
Shh.

33:36.679 --> 33:38.408
Why are you shushing
me in an empty warehouse?

33:38.410 --> 33:40.810
You trying to sneak up
on Melanie and scare her?

33:42.075 --> 33:42.908
Melanie?

34:09.820 --> 34:10.652
Crystal.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.000
Crystal, you okay?

34:14.987 --> 34:16.788
Oh, now what's the problem?

34:19.040 --> 34:20.199
She's in there.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.228
Oh, hell no.

34:42.230 --> 34:43.547
Y'all are going with me, mother fuckers.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.378
This ain't no one man show.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.909
Get your ass over here.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.040
I'll be right back.

35:56.486 --> 35:57.319
Crystal?

35:59.423 --> 36:01.036
Yeah?

36:01.038 --> 36:04.115
I think we need to get out of here.

36:04.117 --> 36:06.706
That's what I've been saying.

36:22.086 --> 36:24.168
Come on, I can't carry you both.

36:26.290 --> 36:28.130
Move your ass, you fucking pussy.

36:29.290 --> 36:30.458
You know what, Spaz?

36:30.460 --> 36:31.949
You can kiss my ass.

36:33.574 --> 36:35.564
What the fuck?

36:38.850 --> 36:40.017
What the fuck?

37:06.882 --> 37:08.465
Hey, mother fucker.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.649
Ah!

37:33.415 --> 37:34.742
Who was that guy?

37:48.633 --> 37:51.191
Let's block in the fucking door.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.090
I think he's gone.

38:17.660 --> 38:20.077
What are we gonna do?

38:23.680 --> 38:25.618
You guys go find the cops.

38:25.620 --> 38:28.218
Marcus and I are gonna go get this fucker.

38:28.220 --> 38:29.928
Are you fucking crazy?

38:29.930 --> 38:31.668
Lump is still down there.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.198
He's fucking killing him down there.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.031
Fuck him!

38:34.033 --> 38:35.038
Fuck him?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.340
Fuck you!

38:36.342 --> 38:38.576
I'm not leaving anybody behind!

38:47.240 --> 38:48.572
Fuck, you're not
opening this fucking door!

38:48.574 --> 38:50.028
You don't know what's
going on down there!

38:50.030 --> 38:51.388
He could still be alive!

38:51.390 --> 38:53.428
I am not leaving anybody behind!

38:53.430 --> 38:55.408
We don't know what he's
fucking doing to him!

38:58.440 --> 39:00.640
Call
your friends down here.

39:02.605 --> 39:03.546
Fuck you!

39:03.548 --> 39:05.456
I'm not leaving any one
of my friends down there!

39:05.458 --> 39:06.289
Blow!

39:06.291 --> 39:07.671
You don't know!

39:07.673 --> 39:09.090
Crystal!

39:09.989 --> 39:10.822
Spaz!

39:13.028 --> 39:14.278
Help me please.

39:21.498 --> 39:23.360
Get the fuck outta here.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.273
Go!

39:32.730 --> 39:35.181
Some friends you got there.

39:39.887 --> 39:41.448
Get the fuck off me.

39:41.450 --> 39:44.928
You listen to me, you
pansy piece of shit.

39:44.930 --> 39:48.048
That cock sucker down there
just killed two of our friends.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.158
You are gonna go with me and help nail

39:50.160 --> 39:52.778
his ass to the fucking wall.

39:52.780 --> 39:54.680
I told you to get the fuck outta here.

39:56.010 --> 39:57.860
We're not going anywhere.

40:01.890 --> 40:04.198
What are you talking about?

40:04.200 --> 40:05.600
Go see for yourself.

40:29.589 --> 40:31.231
What should we do?

40:31.233 --> 40:32.566
Shut up.

40:51.194 --> 40:52.361
Move!

40:54.538 --> 40:55.600
This is the same window?

40:55.602 --> 40:58.923
Of course this is
the same fucking window.

40:58.925 --> 41:01.592
Mother fucking son of a bitch.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.119
Fuck!

41:07.438 --> 41:09.521
Crystal, what's going on?

41:10.356 --> 41:11.886
I don't know.

41:11.888 --> 41:13.068
Don't give me that shit.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.080
You know something.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.130
I don't know.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.643
But...

41:22.000 --> 41:23.210
I can find out.

41:50.158 --> 41:51.741
Something's coming.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.297
Hi, hello.

42:50.935 --> 42:53.768
Who are you?

42:56.422 --> 42:59.509
My name is Sally.

42:59.511 --> 43:01.070
I used to live here.

43:02.510 --> 43:05.663
Me and my mommy are just visiting.

43:05.665 --> 43:06.498
Yay.

43:08.770 --> 43:09.820
Is your name Crystal?

43:11.179 --> 43:12.012
Pretty.

43:15.408 --> 43:18.107
Yes.

43:18.109 --> 43:19.713
Daddy
said I'm not supposed

43:19.715 --> 43:21.696
to talk to you.

43:25.871 --> 43:29.038
Please, tell me.

43:30.321 --> 43:32.154
What's happening here?

43:34.689 --> 43:38.022
A lot of bad things.

43:38.936 --> 43:41.453
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

43:41.455 --> 43:42.705
Secrets, but...

43:48.314 --> 43:49.147
I will.

43:50.386 --> 43:51.219
Bad girl.

43:57.110 --> 43:58.430
We used to live here.

44:13.568 --> 44:14.670
There was me,

44:15.950 --> 44:17.040
my mom,

44:19.060 --> 44:20.360
and my dad.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.210
I don't think my dad was very happy.

44:44.410 --> 44:46.540
He was mad all the time,

44:48.420 --> 44:49.980
and when he was mad,

44:52.424 --> 44:55.168
he'd always start yelling.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.226
Hey, what the hell you guys doing?

44:57.228 --> 44:58.598
It's a ten-minute goddamn job,

44:58.600 --> 44:59.818
you been working it 30 minutes.

44:59.820 --> 45:01.858
Now get those goddamn boxes off.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.398
Get 'em over there right now.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.658
What the fuck you want us to do?

45:04.660 --> 45:07.208
We only have two fucking
hands, man, not four.

45:07.210 --> 45:08.658
We only have two fucking hands.

45:08.660 --> 45:09.811
What the fuck you want us to do?

45:09.813 --> 45:11.558
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

45:11.560 --> 45:13.694
Don't you ever talk to me like that again.

45:13.696 --> 45:15.636
Don't you ever.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.301
Jesus Christ.

45:19.303 --> 45:22.720
He was only ever nice to a dog.

45:23.785 --> 45:25.864
Yes, there, that's my baby.

45:25.866 --> 45:27.533
My baby, baby, baby.

45:31.151 --> 45:32.722
Oh yes you are.

45:32.724 --> 45:33.668
But one day...

45:33.670 --> 45:35.348
Yes you are.

45:35.350 --> 45:37.375
Pappy ran away.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.100
There were these guys
that worked for my dad.

45:59.150 --> 46:02.948
Mom said they were really nice.

46:02.950 --> 46:04.218
Can you two keep a secret?

46:04.220 --> 46:05.908
Yeah, what?

46:05.910 --> 46:08.500
Last night, me and...

46:11.320 --> 46:12.698
Mrs. Cleaver.

46:14.772 --> 46:15.766
Serious, I was like...

46:26.568 --> 46:27.918
Put that goddamn cigarette out.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.508
Can't you read the fuckin' sign?

47:21.047 --> 47:22.797
Daddy had to let them go.

47:24.010 --> 47:26.908
Mommy got upset.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.090
You are a fucking idiot.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.180
I cannot believe you fired those guys.

47:35.550 --> 47:36.680
You pussy.

47:37.990 --> 47:40.288
You let those guys go and you think you're

47:40.290 --> 47:42.770
gonna run this goddamn place by yourself.

47:44.018 --> 47:46.210
God, what an idiot!

47:47.950 --> 47:50.540
You're just gonna run it
into the goddamn ground.

47:52.410 --> 47:55.798
What's gonna happen to
your family then, huh?

47:55.800 --> 47:58.728
This is how you take care of your family?

47:58.730 --> 47:59.888
Sally and I are gonna be out

47:59.890 --> 48:02.838
on the goddamn street like beggars.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.673
Stop drinking!

48:04.810 --> 48:07.378
All you do is sit there and drink!

48:07.380 --> 48:10.040
That's all you do anymore, God!

48:15.920 --> 48:16.751
I don't know what we're gonna do,

48:16.753 --> 48:18.218
I don't know what we're gonna do

48:18.220 --> 48:23.220
because you are a goddamn loser
and you never listen to me.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.590
You never goddamn listen.

48:41.254 --> 48:43.325
One day, the police came.

48:48.230 --> 48:49.558
Mr. Cleaver?

48:49.560 --> 48:51.518
Yeah, who are you?

48:51.520 --> 48:53.848
I'm Agent Hollis from
the Health Department.

48:53.850 --> 48:55.308
I'm here to inspect the premises.

48:55.310 --> 48:56.760
You mind if I come in?

49:08.870 --> 49:10.950
Daddy did his best.

49:13.730 --> 49:18.730
He tried really hard to run
the business all by himself,

49:21.305 --> 49:23.210
but no matter what he did,

49:26.169 --> 49:28.110
he couldn't get everything done.

49:45.442 --> 49:47.192
So he got in trouble.

49:48.050 --> 49:49.440
This is your B-12.

49:51.490 --> 49:52.940
This is your S-5.

49:54.796 --> 49:56.598
If you wanna appeal it, you can contact

49:56.600 --> 49:58.110
the people on those papers.

50:00.210 --> 50:01.960
You're not gonna stay for dinner!

50:03.900 --> 50:04.790
Fuckin' asshole.

50:08.270 --> 50:10.808
Mommy got upset again.

50:10.810 --> 50:12.588
What'd I fucking tell you?

50:12.590 --> 50:15.599
I told you not to fire
those guys, didn't I?

50:15.601 --> 50:18.598
Now they shut your ass down.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.188
What are we supposed to do now, huh?

50:20.190 --> 50:22.808
You lost us our goddamn home.

50:22.810 --> 50:24.510
Where are we supposed to go, huh?

50:25.440 --> 50:28.548
Big man with all the answers, huh?

50:28.550 --> 50:29.398
What are we gonna eat?

50:29.400 --> 50:31.708
You got money to buy food?

50:31.710 --> 50:32.968
You don't, do you?

50:32.970 --> 50:34.858
God, what was I thinking?

50:34.860 --> 50:38.300
I'm taking Sally and I'm
leaving you and this dump.

50:42.305 --> 50:43.271
Eh!

50:43.273 --> 50:44.598
What?

50:44.600 --> 50:46.918
Can we try to have a
friendly conversation here?

50:46.920 --> 50:48.748
Oh, now you wanna talk.

50:48.750 --> 50:51.732
You haven't talked for years, okay, okay.

51:24.560 --> 51:27.390
I was doing my
homework when it happened.

51:33.426 --> 51:34.820
I guess he was still mad.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.010
What's that smell?

51:39.870 --> 51:40.758
It's your mother.

51:40.760 --> 51:41.610
She's cooking.

51:51.030 --> 51:54.044
He put me in the freezer.

51:54.046 --> 51:56.830
He said he was saving me for dessert.

51:58.910 --> 52:00.850
That's what he always called it.

52:03.922 --> 52:07.590
So, he got in trouble again.

52:12.710 --> 52:13.810
Mr. Cleaver.

52:15.850 --> 52:17.768
I've had the honor of
sittin' on this bench

52:17.770 --> 52:22.668
for some 12 years now and
never in all that time

52:22.670 --> 52:25.290
have I presided over a case of such

52:26.530 --> 52:30.770
inhuman brutality, such wanton deviance,

52:32.920 --> 52:36.688
and because I find you
to be devoid of even

52:36.690 --> 52:40.628
the slightest bit of
remorse for your crimes

52:40.630 --> 52:44.638
and because you continue
to prove yourself a threat

52:44.640 --> 52:46.850
even within the confines of prison,

52:48.730 --> 52:50.898
I feel that I have no
choice but to sentence

52:50.900 --> 52:53.990
you to death by electrocution.

52:56.444 --> 52:59.104
May God have mercy on your soul.

53:01.361 --> 53:02.861
Court's adjourned.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.788
When we were done, me and Mommy

53:31.790 --> 53:34.225
went to a nice place,

53:34.227 --> 53:35.220
angels,

53:39.140 --> 53:42.220
but they said that Daddy couldn't come.

53:43.602 --> 53:46.618
They put him somewhere else.

53:46.620 --> 53:49.008
Somewhere bad.

53:49.010 --> 53:49.843
Fire.

53:52.660 --> 53:55.318
Daddy didn't like it there,

53:55.320 --> 53:57.650
and started a lot of trouble.

53:59.630 --> 54:01.957
They couldn't make him behave.

54:01.959 --> 54:02.792
Evil.

54:05.055 --> 54:07.650
They didn't want him there anymore,

54:08.550 --> 54:11.730
so they gave him his skin back,

54:12.990 --> 54:15.980
but there was nowhere else to put him,

54:17.100 --> 54:19.580
no place except one,

54:22.240 --> 54:23.073
back home.

54:51.140 --> 54:52.930
When they let him out,

54:54.381 --> 54:57.798
there was something they didn't tell him.

55:17.530 --> 55:19.680
He could have his skin,

55:21.400 --> 55:23.930
but he'd never be able to leave.

55:29.310 --> 55:31.020
He tried for a long time.

55:48.395 --> 55:49.884
What the hell am I doing
with this stupid thing?

55:51.290 --> 55:54.510
But nothing worked.

55:54.512 --> 55:58.179
And after a while, he
started to get hungry.

56:00.209 --> 56:01.751
Come here.

56:07.150 --> 56:08.540
Gotcha, you little bastard.

56:23.633 --> 56:25.883
Then there
was nothing left to eat.

56:30.360 --> 56:35.180
He was so hungry that he tried
to go back to the bad place...

56:36.862 --> 56:37.898
Oh fuck.

56:37.900 --> 56:39.250
But every time...

56:43.118 --> 56:45.444
He just came back here.

56:48.597 --> 56:51.768
When he knew he could never get out,

56:51.770 --> 56:56.690
he started to eat the
only thing he had left.

57:15.620 --> 57:17.980
There
isn't much of him anymore.

57:19.790 --> 57:22.310
And he gets hungrier every day.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.370
Hungry for all sorts of things.

57:28.663 --> 57:31.620
But now you and your
friends are here, suffer.

57:36.189 --> 57:38.380
Please, can you help us

57:42.662 --> 57:43.995
get out of here?

57:46.795 --> 57:48.128
Can you help us?

57:51.620 --> 57:53.410
Nothing can help you now.

57:54.940 --> 57:57.880
And there is no way out of here.

58:15.657 --> 58:17.157
You should go now.

58:30.802 --> 58:33.750
I am gonna kill you,
you fucking cock sucker.

58:35.950 --> 58:36.783
Let it go.

58:40.796 --> 58:42.820
Yeah, you better run away, bitch!

58:56.010 --> 58:57.330
Crystal's awake.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.681
Shit, I thought we lost you.

59:06.683 --> 59:07.514
What did I miss?

59:07.516 --> 59:09.555
Everything's fine.

59:09.557 --> 59:10.808
We're gonna get this guy.

59:10.810 --> 59:11.688
No, we're not!

59:11.690 --> 59:14.278
Shut up, we
need to get out of here.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.098
Fine, you all
stay here and I'll go

59:16.100 --> 59:18.158
knock this asshole out
and then go get help.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.538
No you won't.

59:19.540 --> 59:20.868
Crystal.

59:20.870 --> 59:23.565
Look, I'm glad that you're
okay, but I swear to God,

59:23.567 --> 59:24.748
if you give me any of your shit,

59:24.750 --> 59:26.318
I'll break your fucking jaw.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.078
This guy butchered his family.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.768
Got the chair.

59:30.770 --> 59:33.550
He's been trapped in here ever since.

59:35.615 --> 59:37.940
What do you think you're gonna do, Spaz?

59:38.800 --> 59:39.638
She's right.

59:39.640 --> 59:40.718
We can't fuck with this guy.

59:40.720 --> 59:41.818
Oh, Jesus.

59:41.820 --> 59:44.548
That's right,
that's right, Crystal.

59:44.550 --> 59:45.438
Spaz, you're full of shit.

59:45.440 --> 59:46.518
You're not gonna do anything.

59:46.520 --> 59:47.880
Liz, pipe down.

59:51.413 --> 59:53.980
Liz, Melanie
wanted you to have this.

59:58.005 --> 59:59.588
Goddammit!

01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:12.631
Open the
door, you fucking pussy.

01:00:12.633 --> 01:00:13.778
I'm a fucking pussy?

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.010
Come out, we'll see who
the fucking pussy is!

01:00:18.618 --> 01:00:19.449
You're a dead man.

01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:20.450
You're a fucking dead man.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.660
Oh God, what is it?

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:32.680
It's Lump's lump.

01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:35.084
Lump's lump?

01:00:39.777 --> 01:00:41.330
Lump's fucking lump.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.515
Son of a bitch, goddamn mother fucking,

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.338
cunt piece of shit bastard!

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.598
That is it!

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.408
I am tired of fucking
around with this asshole!

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:53.874
You want a war?

01:00:53.876 --> 01:00:57.118
I'll give you a fucking war mother fucker!

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.284
Bring it mother fucker!

01:00:58.286 --> 01:00:59.767
Bring it!

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.828
It's hammer time.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.849
Spaz.

01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:09.684
Look.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.318
Either you guys help me take him down,

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.410
or I will fucking kill you all.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.513
Are you ready?

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.850
Marcus, are you ready?

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.653
Uh huh.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:44.736
Spaz.

01:03:47.601 --> 01:03:48.434
Spaz!

01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:50.739
Are you ready?

01:04:54.081 --> 01:04:54.914
Get up.

01:04:56.186 --> 01:04:57.380
Get the fuck up.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.138
Oh hey, big man huh?

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.324
Big scary mother fucker?

01:05:03.326 --> 01:05:04.807
Big man now?

01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:06.891
Yeah, you tell me.

01:05:06.893 --> 01:05:09.398
Big man, you killed Lump.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.350
You were a big man when you killed Liz.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:16.399
You were a big man when
you fucking killed Melanie.

01:05:36.287 --> 01:05:37.120
Ah!

01:05:40.693 --> 01:05:41.526
Ah!

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880
He's not dead.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.918
Oh yeah?

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.560
Well, he'll never dance again.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.153
Can we go?

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.123
Okay.

01:07:02.178 --> 01:07:03.011
Ah!

01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:37.118
Crystal!

01:08:37.121 --> 01:08:38.756
Crystal!

01:08:38.758 --> 01:08:40.096
This is your fucking fault!

01:08:40.099 --> 01:08:41.662
You're the reason this is happening!

01:08:41.663 --> 01:08:44.569
You're.

01:08:44.572 --> 01:08:45.403
Hey!

01:08:45.404 --> 01:08:46.923
Hey, she's over here!

01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:48.274
She's over here!

01:08:48.276 --> 01:08:49.728
Let me go, let me go.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.108
Shut up!

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:52.835
Fucking bitch.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.434
Tammy, Tammy.

01:09:33.511 --> 01:09:35.178
She went that way.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.390
Burn it down.

01:10:28.162 --> 01:10:30.944
This is all your fault!

01:10:30.946 --> 01:10:33.560
Crystal's
gonna free us, Daddy!

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.250
Now, don't do anything rash, sweetheart.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.228
What are you gonna do?

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.798
You gonna kill me?

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.028
I've died a hundred times.

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.218
I'm still here.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.303
You know why?

01:10:47.301 --> 01:10:48.410
I don't give a shit.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.018
Because hell doesn't even want me.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.610
I keep going there, they
keep sending me back here.

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:58.360
They just can't handle me down there.

01:11:00.438 --> 01:11:02.188
Fuck you.

01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:11.969
No, fuck you.

01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:47.768
This is the place.

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:48.603
Alright.

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:55.650
How are we gonna get in?

01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:06.702
Dinner!

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:15.650
