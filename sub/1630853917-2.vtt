WEBVTT

00:13.722 --> 00:14.723
God.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.196
Thought we were gonna see the widow?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
We are.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.076
We're just gonna have a word
with her sisters first.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.428
Oh, fuck.

01:36.889 --> 01:37.890
Oh, shit.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.853
Shit. Fuck.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.948
You know,
they have every right not to talk to us.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.491
You know that, right? We're not Garda.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.994
Absolutely.
I think they shouldn't talk to us.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.370
What? Well, then, why are we here?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.915
If they don't answer our questions,
we'll leave them alone,

02:02.998 --> 02:04.458
admit defeat, pay out.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.628
But if they invite us in,
we'll know they've got something to hide.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.799
And then we'll haul each one of them
over hot coals until we get to the truth.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.929
Sorry to bother.
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.473
Yeah, I remember you.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.061
Come in.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.391
Do you mind if I record our conversation?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.934
What for?

03:46.018 --> 03:49.146
It's mostly just for,
you know, so I have it--

03:49.229 --> 03:51.481
It's fine. Go ahead.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.483
Do your thing.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.068
Great.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.203
Miss Garvey,
do you mind telling us where you were

04:04.286 --> 04:07.831
the night of claim reference 1757318?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.167
The night Mr. Williams died.

04:10.834 --> 04:14.838
Do you mind telling me what my whereabouts
has to do with our claim?

04:14.922 --> 04:18.091
When we're dealing with
a payout of this size, it's customary to--

04:18.175 --> 04:19.927
Yeah, it's okay. I was with Grace.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.428
We all were.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.723
-All of you?
-Yeah.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.807
Yeah, we're very close.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.726
We get together as often as we can here.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.936
Well, that's nice.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.646
Tight-knit family.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.899
I mean, I didn't even meet my brother
till he was about, what, five years old.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.652
-Let's just stay on track.
-This is your brother?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.862
-Thought he was your son.
-No.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.281
How would he be my son?

04:41.365 --> 04:44.826
-Well, just, it's Claffin and Sons.
-No, that's our father.

04:44.910 --> 04:45.953
Yeah. Also, I'm 35.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.120
We're half brothers.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.914
Yeah? No shit.

04:50.916 --> 04:55.379
You and the insured, Mr. Williams,
you were colleagues?

04:55.963 --> 04:56.964
Yeah.

04:57.965 --> 04:58.966
Were you very close?

05:01.385 --> 05:04.179
We weren't very close.
No. We didn't get on.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.181
Meaning?

05:06.265 --> 05:08.350
Meaning you don't get to choose
your brother-in-law.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.144
Right.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.190
And you didn't think
that he was good enough for her or--

05:26.076 --> 05:28.245
Sorry. It's a friend.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.788
Friend.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.583
Hi, this is Matt. Leave a message.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.545
Very seductive.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.131
You should
save something for the imagination.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.591
A girl likes a little mystery.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.761
So, Matt, I have a free night,

05:44.845 --> 05:49.057
and I was wondering
if you maybe wanted to grab some dinner.

05:50.434 --> 05:54.646
This is Becka, by the way.
From the pub. From the accident.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.316
I said I'd massage you.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.194
Oh, shit.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.529
Not in a sexual way. It's--

06:03.363 --> 06:05.032
Hello? Oh, shit.

06:05.949 --> 06:06.950
Okay.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.788
Now, the night the AD&D came into effect…

06:11.872 --> 06:13.832
-That's accidental--
-Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.752
…do you remember anything
out of the ordinary?

06:17.836 --> 06:20.339
Any odd behavior from the decedent?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.925
-Do you mean John Paul?
-Yeah.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.384
Just say that then.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.263
Anything at work that may have
spilt over into your personal lives?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.350
A quarrel perhaps?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.186
Anything strange that night?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.314
Well, there was something strange.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.234
Actually, yeah, now that you mention it.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.403
The weather was really bad.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.199
I remember a tree had come down
along the main road.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.283
And…

06:50.077 --> 06:51.662
-And go on.
-Well--

06:51.745 --> 06:54.831
Well, we were ordering in
from a Chinese restaurant,

06:54.915 --> 06:58.377
but 20 minutes later,
there's a bang on the door.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.379
And?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.924
And he hands over a bag of Mexican food.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.802
From a Chinese restaurant.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.887
Like, a bunch of Mexican food.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.057
Isn't that weird?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.477
I thought that was weird.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.031
Drive safe.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.204
-Well, you can see why she's alone.
-Didn't give us much, did she?

07:35.330 --> 07:36.331
She gave us plenty.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.043
The cheeky remarks. The deflection.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.339
-Something she didn't want to answer.
-It was you. She didn't wanna answer you.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.800
I don't know.
I thought I was fairly charming.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.304
Bit early for a fire.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.765
Yeah. Clearly the godmother
of the murderous middle-aged sister gang

07:53.849 --> 07:55.017
is burning evidence.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.060
-Still a joke to you, is it?
-No.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.897
But there's no evidence a crime was
committed. We should be looking for fraud.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.691
Murder is fraud
when there's a life policy to pay out.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.736
-Trust me. I've seen this before.
-When?

08:05.819 --> 08:06.862
Get in the car.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.410
-So, what now?
-Yeah. I've been thinking about this.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.829
We need to exhume the body.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.664
Exhume the-- W--

08:17.748 --> 08:19.499
When you say "we," do you mean you and I?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.001
No. The coroner.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.669
There was no postmortem.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.046
Who knows what we find.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.299
Fingerprints. Needle marks.
Maybe there was drugs in his system.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.383
You've lost your mind.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.093
It's better
than losing my bloody business,

08:30.177 --> 08:31.887
which will happen if we don't prove

08:31.970 --> 08:34.640
-that this man was murdered. Thank you.
-Murdered.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.868
-What are you doing?
-Hang on.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.412
What, Tom?

09:08.841 --> 09:09.842
What are you doing?

09:10.676 --> 09:11.927
Evidence, Matthew.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.347
What the fuck?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.390
Bye, Dad! I'll see you after school!

10:04.313 --> 10:05.480
Gracie!

10:06.064 --> 10:09.902
Need to get into work! It's quarter to!

10:09.985 --> 10:11.486
Five seconds!

10:13.155 --> 10:15.866
-Two seconds!
-All right.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.829
Lovely.

10:21.747 --> 10:25.167
I'm going to have a steam
after the gym, so let's eat at 8:00.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.921
I have a stiff calf
I need some moist heat on.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.964
Good idea. Get ready for the walk.

10:31.048 --> 10:34.760
It's not a walk.
It's a 15K all-terrain elite hike.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.763
Which by the way, none of your sisters
have sponsored me for.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.431
They're probably just busy.

10:39.515 --> 10:43.018
Break these in for me, will you?
Just wear them around the house.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.563
And go to the salon while you're in town.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.106
Treat yourself to a freshen up.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.817
You think I need a freshen up?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.694
Did I say "need"?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.364
Thought I said "treat."

10:56.490 --> 11:01.119
Gracie, honestly,
don't make me walk on glass.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.851
What?

11:24.560 --> 11:26.728
I just learned so much about you.

11:27.896 --> 11:31.066
Wow! You're a completely different person
than I thought.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.901
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.987
What did you think I was like?

11:35.487 --> 11:39.867
I don't know. Thought you'd
be more classic, like Céline Dion, Cher.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.244
Fuck off.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.583
Fucking Céline Dion?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.008
Architecture is God?

11:57.050 --> 12:01.054
Oh, no, I bless myself because I
so desperately want that not to get built.

12:02.431 --> 12:03.682
I like it.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.392
Why? You not a fan of change?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.104
What? You like it?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.023
Yeah, I'm a fan of change.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.775
I mean, normally I love what we do,
but that's just…

12:14.610 --> 12:16.612
Look at that. That is a street crime.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.489
And it's gonna bankrupt us.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.619
A little bird told me
you're about to be financial director.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.370
Maybe.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.373
Who do I have to sleep with
to get an opportunity like that?

12:28.874 --> 12:30.834
-Me.
-What?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.044
What do you mean? What?

12:32.127 --> 12:33.754
-No, I was just--
-No, I was joking.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.881
I-- Lost in translation. I--

12:36.381 --> 12:38.675
Gerald! You'd have to sleep with Gerald.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.845
-Well, I'm pleased.
-What's he doing in?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.097
He's never normally here this early.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.850
Yeah. Maybe he's filing a complaint
against himself.

12:46.934 --> 12:47.935
Morning, team.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.522
Gabriel, we never really had
a chance to talk.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.148
How are you settling in? All good?

12:53.232 --> 12:54.358
Yes, great, thank you.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.610
But we've met and talked several times.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.694
Obvi-- Yes, of course.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.572
But anything I can do to help
to give you the smoothest entry possible,

13:00.656 --> 13:01.657
just say.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.617
-Jesus Christ.
-Eva?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.161
I just put my hat in the ring
for the financial director post.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.539
Gerald's pleased, of course.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.542
So I hope you don't mind
a little friendly competition

13:12.209 --> 13:14.878
from the one person here
who knows your dirty secrets.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.964
Just joking.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.843
What?

13:34.231 --> 13:37.651
I have to go home. I have to get there
before Donal and the kids get back.

13:38.277 --> 13:39.862
What are you doing?

13:41.071 --> 13:42.406
Hold on.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.032
What are you do-- I said I had to go.

13:44.116 --> 13:47.035
-Hang on, are you writing on me?
-Just hold still.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.081
That really tickles. Okay.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.091
Why would you do something so stupid?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.219
I don't know.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.680
Maybe being with you
makes me do stupid things.

14:16.607 --> 14:20.068
-I feel like I've run 10K.
-I could go another right now.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.364
So, will I get to see you tomorrow?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.283
Yeah, I hope so.
As long as I get back before--

14:26.366 --> 14:29.036
Oh, for fuck's sake.
It's my brother-in-law. He's a prick.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.370
Hi, JP.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.414
-You're a long way from home.
-Yeah.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.376
You gonna introduce us?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.505
Yeah, of course. It's-- This is Ben.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.882
He's my photography teacher.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.760
I just had a class.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.222
We all need our outlets, don't we?
Keeps life from getting stale.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.140
How's she getting on?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.100
Yeah. She's great.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.810
She's a talent.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.354
I'm sure she is.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.440
Well, back to class.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.866
Here we go. Home again.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.826
Thanks for taking me shopping, Auntie Eva.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.036
You coming in?

15:11.411 --> 15:15.666
-No. I've a stack of work on, so…
-All right. Bye.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.000
-Hey!
-Hey.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.085
Come in!

15:18.502 --> 15:19.795
Please.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.922
Fuck's sake. Okay.

15:23.632 --> 15:24.633
Okay.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.011
I don't know if that would be enough.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.597
Do it! Do the drop. Do the--

15:30.681 --> 15:32.683
-Oh, God!
-Wow.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.017
Then, whoa.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.855
You can do it. You do it.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.231
You got the moves.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.983
Another bag of goodies?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.110
Yeah, well. That's what aunties are for.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.195
Not all aunties.
Do you remember Auntie Orla?

15:45.279 --> 15:47.906
Is this a terrible thing to say?
Is she dead?

15:47.990 --> 15:50.033
Yes, Eva. She is dead.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.619
But it's hard to remember it
'cause she was ill for so long.

15:52.703 --> 15:53.996
And then she got better.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.831
And then she disappeared.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.087
I was gonna say.
Lizzo's playing in Dublin next week.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.714
Birthday present for the Blanaid?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.340
-Over my dead body.
-Yes.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.425
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.678
Eva, to what do we owe the pleasure?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.055
I was just dropping Blanaid back.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.057
Do you know what? I should head off now.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.767
How was school, sweetheart?

16:15.851 --> 16:17.728
Did you get your mark back
on your photosynthesis quiz?

16:17.811 --> 16:18.937
Got a 96.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.772
An A-star.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.399
That's great!

16:23.817 --> 16:27.070
-It's not from the ground she licked it.
-Will you not stay for dinner, no?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.364
Oh, no.
You know, I've got a stack of work on--

16:29.448 --> 16:32.075
What is it they say?
To be a perfect guest, stay at home.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.786
Mammy, we need to get this soaking.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.455
Otherwise you're looking at a stain.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.920
I have not had to put the bins out
in ten years.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.756
-Did I say a thing? I didn't say a thing.
-No, it's just…

16:48.258 --> 16:49.426
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.094
I'll see you later, chicken.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.765
Come here. Why'd you stop dancing
when your daddy walked in?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.683
He just doesn't like it
when I dance like that.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.893
Huh? What?

16:58.393 --> 17:00.729
Yeah, he says
it looks like I'm asking for it.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.528
The prick's becoming an even bigger prick.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.614
He put himself up for the promotion today.
My promotion.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.782
He's doing it to mess with my head, but--

17:12.866 --> 17:15.327
I've been thinking about
that talk we had a while back.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.204
What talk?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.873
Christmas. At the Forty Foot.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.792
Yeah, I was pissed, Bibi.
You're gonna have to remind me.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.294
About looking out for Grace.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.421
-Oh, right, yeah.
-And killing John Paul.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.300
What?

17:30.384 --> 17:31.677
It's all I think about.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.263
It's on a loop in my head.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.223
What are you talking about, Bibi?

17:36.932 --> 17:39.601
-We were joking!
-Well, I wasn't.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.228
Well, I was!

17:41.311 --> 17:44.356
Eva, you said so yourself.
He's sucking the life out of her.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.526
-He's slowly killing her.
-I'm hungry. Are you a bit hungry?

17:47.609 --> 17:51.363
Eva, we cannot just sit back
and do nothing while he drags her under.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.408
God knows, she's not gonna save herself.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.743
I'm not sure what I have.
I might order in though.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.203
Imagine being rid of him.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.999
The prick, gone from her life.
Gone from all of our lives.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.335
I've been thinking of ways to do it
and not get caught,

18:05.419 --> 18:08.630
-and it's trickier than you think.
-Trickier? What?

18:08.714 --> 18:12.509
-Then I saw this.
-I'm not doing this with you, you mad cow!

18:12.593 --> 18:13.886
Jesus, Bibi!

18:14.887 --> 18:20.225
This house fire.
Three people died, but it was an accident.

18:20.309 --> 18:23.312
An investigation found
it was caused by a gas leak.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.147
A spark from a washing machine.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.774
Please, Eva.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.452
Look, I know what he did.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.706
-If anyone deserves to hate him--
-This isn't revenge.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.000
-I don't think even you believe that.
-It isn't.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.003
We can't just kill our brother-in-law.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.881
Bibi! Do I wish he was dead? Yeah.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.466
He is a piece of shit.

18:52.549 --> 18:58.096
But that is not how, you know--
That's not how life, society works.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.099
Okay? You can't just explode a man.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.895
It's barbaric is what it is.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.064
And you and me, we're not…

19:08.190 --> 19:09.191
Barbarians?

19:10.067 --> 19:11.235
Murderers.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.321
We're not murderers.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.117
We could do it in Wicklow.

19:19.785 --> 19:22.746
He's going there on
some stupid fucking sponsored walk soon.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.374
-I saw it in Grace's calendar.
-So?

19:25.457 --> 19:28.710
So, he will be staying at their cabin.

19:29.503 --> 19:33.257
We play happy families one last time
at Blanaid's confirmation,

19:33.340 --> 19:37.469
and then the following weekend
we blow the bloody doors off.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.722
You're talking about taking a man's life.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.058
Not a man.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.769
That man.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.313
That monster.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.901
Give me one good reason why we shouldn't.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.364
Because he's Blanaid's father.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.385
I meant to tell ya.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.637
Michael asked
if he could get a TikTok account today.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.599
Right. Which means he probably
already has one. Fucking Molly.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.477
Yeah. As long as
he doesn't rope us in to family dancing.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.276
Did you take this?

20:34.526 --> 20:36.570
-Yeah. For class.
-God, you're good, aren't you?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.407
You should take one of us and the kids

20:40.490 --> 20:43.827
wearing matching sweaters,
straddling a giant log.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.729
You know-- Just give me a minute.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.164
Fuck!

21:30.999 --> 21:33.418
Just-- I'm just going to the toilet.

21:34.837 --> 21:37.464
When did we start
locking the door for that?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.175
Fuck.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.809
Beautiful day for a confirmation, Mammy.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.019
Do you want a peek at the broach?

21:51.103 --> 21:52.354
Yes, please.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.314
It's really something, isn't it?

21:54.898 --> 21:55.941
It's a pro-life pin.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.318
I'm going to give it to her now.
Is that okay?

21:58.402 --> 22:00.654
Have a little
father-daughter quality time.

22:00.737 --> 22:01.572
Of course.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.991
I mean, she's growing up so fast.

22:04.074 --> 22:06.410
I really feel I need to grab
all these moments while I can

22:06.493 --> 22:08.412
and talk about what lies ahead.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.914
I mean, sinning counts now.

22:11.707 --> 22:12.958
She'll want to remember that.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.545
I'll get rid of him.

22:22.301 --> 22:23.302
Listen, I won't keep ya.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.596
Few bob there for Blanaid for the big day.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.973
-You're so kind.
-It's not a bother.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.349
Horse came in, you know.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.976
You're looking lovely by the way, Grace.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.519
Isn't she?

22:32.603 --> 22:34.938
Like fine wine, getting better with age.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.858
Are you giving away money
you can't afford, Roger?

22:37.941 --> 22:39.276
No. I was just saying to Grace

22:39.359 --> 22:40.736
that I had a horse come in.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.280
-Is she looking forward to the big day?
-She is, yeah.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.616
Come over after for a sandwich
or a cup of tea.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.243
-No, it's a family occasion.
-It is. Yeah.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.870
We'll see you soon, Roger.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.122
-Are you taking the boat out?
-I'm not taking the boat out.

22:52.206 --> 22:54.041
-No, I'm not. Bye.
-Okay.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.125
Jesus Christ.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.628
Here, take that.

22:58.587 --> 23:02.508
What is he thinking?

23:04.134 --> 23:05.761
Absolutely inappropriate.

23:20.359 --> 23:23.695
-Dad, knock.
-Why? What are you hiding?

23:24.947 --> 23:26.323
What's that?

23:26.406 --> 23:27.991
I have a little something for you.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.076
Really?

23:29.493 --> 23:30.577
For the big day.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.248
It's all happening so fast.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.794
It'll be your responsibility
to practice your faith now.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.671
It won't be mum and--

23:44.258 --> 23:45.300
What's the matter?

23:46.176 --> 23:47.261
See you downstairs.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.725
Why in hell are you
buying lingerie for a child?

23:53.809 --> 23:55.018
I didn't buy anything.

23:55.102 --> 23:56.728
She has got a bra up there.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.856
I don't know anything about--
Wait, what? She has a bra?

23:58.939 --> 24:00.732
Do you want her growing up
before her time?

24:00.816 --> 24:02.901
I don't know anything about it.
I wish I did.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.111
She must have bought it for herself.

24:04.695 --> 24:07.573
So, since when does
a 12-year-old child go into a lingerie--

24:07.656 --> 24:09.992
A bra is not lingerie, John Paul.

24:10.826 --> 24:12.244
She is 12. It's a normal age.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.080
If you're Molly,
and you've tits made of fat.

24:15.163 --> 24:18.750
Oh, my God! Auntie Eva got it for me,
because I asked her to.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.712
Because I knew you'd be freaks about it.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.889
Emma Jane Catherine.

24:32.890 --> 24:35.434
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.060
Amen.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.104
-Peace be with you.
-And with your spirit.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.238
Blanaid Maria Bernard.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.826
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.287
-Amen.
-Peace be with you.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.331
And with your spirit.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.587
She looks lovely.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.173
Hey, you.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.260
This is nice.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.849
What the hell is he staring at?

25:18.977 --> 25:21.021
-Don't know.
-Prick.

25:21.104 --> 25:24.024
Big smile. That's it, Blanaid.

25:24.858 --> 25:28.403
Okay, everybody in. Come on, kids.
Mommy, kids, in together.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.030
Come on. Go through. Squeeze.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.616
Squeeze in together. Say cheese.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.077
-Cheese.
-That's the one.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.370
That's the one.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.330
Lovely.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.582
Here you go.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.876
-Did you say cheese?
-Yes, I did.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.294
That's beautiful, Urs.

25:44.378 --> 25:45.420
It is.

25:45.921 --> 25:47.256
-Ruben, come on.
-That's frameable.

25:47.756 --> 25:50.259
Those after-hours lessons
are really paying off, aren't they?

25:50.843 --> 25:53.428
-Michael, give me back my money.
-What after-hour lessons?

25:53.846 --> 25:55.013
Dad, Michael took my money!

25:55.097 --> 25:56.181
Coming, Michael!

25:56.265 --> 25:57.724
-I didn't.
-You did!

25:57.808 --> 25:59.768
Michael, here.
Give it to me. Come over here.

25:59.852 --> 26:02.771
Poor kid's wearing
abortion jazz hands. Did you see that?

26:03.480 --> 26:05.107
I don't know how you work with him.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.733
I would have marched into HR years ago

26:06.817 --> 26:10.612
and told them what a racist, homophobic,
sadistic, bigoted son of a prick he is.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.281
Get rid of him.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.157
That's one way.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.749
Nora, can you give me one of those?

26:22.833 --> 26:24.084
-Please.
-It's for you.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.128
And it's just from me. Okay?

26:26.211 --> 26:29.464
Not from them. Not from those aunties.

26:29.548 --> 26:30.632
Just from this auntie.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.262
Very proud of you today.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.226
Fifty euro. That's very generous.

26:42.269 --> 26:45.689
Perhaps she can spend it on
lace stockings to go with the lingerie.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.858
-What are you talking about?
-John Paul.

26:47.941 --> 26:50.569
-You know exactly what I'm talking about.
-Oh, my God.

26:50.986 --> 26:51.987
Is this about the bra?

26:52.070 --> 26:53.739
So you're not content
with your younger sister

26:53.822 --> 26:55.073
having a reputation about town.

26:55.157 --> 26:57.409
You also need to groom
your 12-year-old niece, is that it?

26:57.492 --> 26:58.869
Can you control your husband, Grace?

26:58.952 --> 27:00.871
I just don't understand
why you didn't ask me, Eva.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.123
Because Blanaid spoke to me about--

27:03.207 --> 27:04.833
I would have liked
to have done that with her.

27:04.917 --> 27:07.002
-I never had that moment with my own mam.
-Grace--

27:07.085 --> 27:08.462
And now you've taken it from me.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.507
She was worried that you
would speak to John Paul.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.966
You would've get his permission--

27:13.050 --> 27:14.051
-I wouldn't have--
-There's nothing there anyway,

27:14.134 --> 27:15.636
two bloody moles worth.

27:16.345 --> 27:17.346
Dad.

27:18.931 --> 27:21.433
Blanaid. Now look what you've done.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.811
Don't you dare turn this on me.

27:24.895 --> 27:26.772
She doesn't come to you,
because she doesn't respect you.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.816
And she doesn't respect you,
because you're weak.

27:32.361 --> 27:35.656
If you want to sexualize a child,
have one of your own.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.744
I forgot. You can't.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.707
Now what's gonna happen?
You're gonna hit me? Are you?

27:48.669 --> 27:50.504
Frigid bitch.

27:59.096 --> 28:00.097
Fuck.

28:41.638 --> 28:45.559
Does this mean you're in?
We're doing the right thing, okay?

28:46.059 --> 28:48.478
For Grace. And for Blanaid.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.175
You all right?

29:24.264 --> 29:25.933
It wasn't fair of Grace to say

29:26.016 --> 29:28.977
that… you took
that moment from her, with Mam.

29:29.978 --> 29:32.606
She missed it because her boobs
took too long to come in.

29:34.691 --> 29:38.153
I had bloody C cups at 12,
and I had no mammy there with me.

29:38.654 --> 29:40.197
But you did great.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.742
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

29:43.825 --> 29:44.826
Yeah.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.540
Did Grace say what day JP
would coming up here?

29:49.623 --> 29:54.211
No, but his walking thing's on Saturday,
so maybe, like, Friday?

29:54.878 --> 29:56.338
So long as he doesn't see Sunday.

30:22.072 --> 30:25.075
I figure we need 50 seconds
to clear the cabin?

30:25.576 --> 30:29.621
So the fuse must be about
three meters away.

30:29.705 --> 30:30.706
Right.

30:30.998 --> 30:33.041
We're gonna have to assume
there's no windows open

30:33.125 --> 30:34.710
or it'll act as a vector if there's wind.

30:36.378 --> 30:40.883
-Hell is a vector?
-Okay, so to the fireplace is…

30:42.801 --> 30:44.052
I don't know if this tape

30:44.136 --> 30:46.638
is going to be long enough.
Bloody thing keeps getting twisted.

30:49.850 --> 30:50.851
Nine meters.

30:52.019 --> 30:53.520
Okay. Write down nine meters.

30:55.606 --> 30:56.690
Eva.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.443
-Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-Nine meters.

31:03.572 --> 31:05.824
I remember smoking up
that chimney with Ciaran?

31:06.366 --> 31:07.951
When you were all asleep.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.661
That was a long time ago.

31:09.745 --> 31:12.915
-Yeah. It's ten years.
-Exactly.

31:12.998 --> 31:16.752
The fireplace is too far.
Help me find another trigger.

31:19.505 --> 31:20.756
What are you doing?

31:20.839 --> 31:23.342
-What are you doing?
-What? I thought you gave that up?

31:23.425 --> 31:24.760
Yeah, I had.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.888
I told you coming up here
was bad for my health.

31:33.185 --> 31:35.521
Everything happens for a reason.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.441
Some patronizing fucker once said.

31:43.862 --> 31:45.447
Well, don't…

31:46.031 --> 31:48.992
Help me find another ignition point, Eva.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.120
Otherwise,
all this will have been for nothing.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.458
Look.

32:01.547 --> 32:02.631
Yeah, I didn't see that.

32:03.507 --> 32:04.758
Open your eyes.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.426
Eye.

32:07.761 --> 32:08.762
Come on.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.812
Hold this. Hold it tight, yeah?

32:17.813 --> 32:19.189
-You got it?
-Yeah.

32:22.526 --> 32:25.445
Yep. That'll work.

32:26.363 --> 32:27.948
-Most important thing.
-What?

32:28.574 --> 32:30.450
Grace and Blanaid aren't with him.

32:35.831 --> 32:38.625
It's an early birthday present
and Christmas present.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.879
Oh, no. I can't.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.256
What? Why?
You can tell Blanaid it was your idea.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.216
-She'll love you for that.
-I don't know.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.635
Look, I feel terrible
about what happened--

32:48.719 --> 32:49.970
Me too.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.848
And it was never about me trying
to take something from you--

32:52.931 --> 32:54.808
Is it okay if we don't talk about it?
Is that okay?

32:54.892 --> 32:56.101
Of course.

32:59.271 --> 33:00.272
But for me.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.192
That could be my "sorry."

33:07.738 --> 33:10.115
-John Paul would never allow--
-John Paul doesn't need to know, does he?

33:10.199 --> 33:12.284
He said he was in Wicklow anyway.
Just en--

33:12.993 --> 33:14.745
Enjoy a night with your daughter.

33:15.996 --> 33:17.623
I can't get her to talk to me, Eva.

33:18.540 --> 33:19.750
It's like I--

33:19.833 --> 33:21.752
I don't know how to give her what sh--

33:21.835 --> 33:23.212
what she wants or…

33:25.088 --> 33:26.590
…or even what she needs.

33:29.843 --> 33:34.264
-John Paul is right. I'm failing.
-J-- Grace.

33:34.348 --> 33:35.599
No, it will be fine. It will be.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.768
I just need to toughen up and wait it out.

33:40.521 --> 33:43.482
Things will get better.
I promise.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.196
I determined the cause
of Mr. Williams's death myself.

33:49.279 --> 33:52.533
Quite frankly, I'm offended
that you're doubting my conclusion.

33:52.616 --> 33:55.118
I think the real offense here is
that there was no forensic autopsy.

33:55.619 --> 33:58.705
-As a matter of principle--
-He had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6%.

33:58.789 --> 33:59.831
Case closed.

33:59.915 --> 34:02.668
Mr. Williams was also
a self-professed teetotaler.

34:03.252 --> 34:06.630
So, 1.6% could demand a second look.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.134
-For Christ's sake.
-I'm sorry.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.219
Is that her again?

34:12.302 --> 34:13.887
-Yeah. I'll just--
-Yeah.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.889
-Why don't you just silence the thing?
-I'm gonna silence it now.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.016
-Turn it off.
-I've turned it off.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.976
Stop wasting my time.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.771
You're not investigators,
you're insurance men.

34:24.022 --> 34:26.733
-Come on.
-Please, Doctor. We're desperate here.

34:27.734 --> 34:30.612
I knew your dad. Ol' Laughin' Claffin.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.156
Used to play darts
with him up at the Gravediggers.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.409
Yeah? Well, I mean do it for him then.

34:37.119 --> 34:40.496
What? Didn't know him that well.
Just played darts with him.

34:41.456 --> 34:44.918
You need an inspector to agree to it.
So take it up with the police.

34:45.543 --> 34:49.339
And you'll need the widow's permission.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

34:50.174 --> 34:51.175
Oh, God.

34:55.971 --> 34:57.014
I'm telling you,

34:57.097 --> 34:59.683
apart from that lady solicitor
he was clearly banging,

34:59.766 --> 35:01.894
Dad knew some real dickheads.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.354
So what now, Thomas?

35:05.063 --> 35:07.232
You know that widow's never
gonna give us her signature.

35:07.316 --> 35:08.984
She's just put him in the ground.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.695
What now? We change our modus operandi.

35:21.246 --> 35:23.498
Well, with any luck, this will be
the last time you see us.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.918
-May I?
-Oh, yeah.

35:27.503 --> 35:30.506
So we met with your sister earlier. Eva.

35:30.589 --> 35:32.132
-You did?
-Lovely woman.

35:33.509 --> 35:35.594
Bit of a sneery head on her, but good fun.

35:36.220 --> 35:39.014
Little difficult. But listen,
that's only if I'm picking out--

35:39.097 --> 35:41.975
She mentioned that
she and your husband didn't always get on.

35:42.059 --> 35:44.061
-She said that?
-Yeah, she did.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.562
I have the exact quote.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.359
Or I could play it for you.

35:50.442 --> 35:51.902
-No, really, I don't need…
-Good, yeah.

35:51.985 --> 35:54.446
-Not sure I could find it.
-Apologies if that was news to you.

35:54.530 --> 35:55.948
No, it's just--

35:56.031 --> 35:58.742
She doesn't seem to be mourning his loss.
Let's just say that.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.370
Well, you know, families,
they have their differences.

36:03.205 --> 36:04.706
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting?

36:04.790 --> 36:06.500
No, I'm not suggesting anything.

36:08.293 --> 36:12.756
But if I was suggesting something,
we do have to look at it from every angle.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.509
-Ask the questions.
-Have you actually asked a question?

36:16.426 --> 36:18.220
Well, I'm gonna ask you one right now.

36:19.096 --> 36:22.808
Is it a possibility that Eva
may have wanted to harm your husband?

36:26.436 --> 36:27.437
Well, you seem upset.

36:28.021 --> 36:31.942
When my parents died,
Eva gave up everything to take care of us.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.735
Took on all the responsibility.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.072
She'd never do anything to hurt me.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.533
Of course she wouldn't.

36:40.534 --> 36:43.287
Anyway, we just have a few papers to sign,
and then we'll be on our way.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.372
Just crossing T's and dotting I's.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.501
And we do have some good news.

36:49.585 --> 36:52.629
-Your sister did corroborate your alibi--
-Alibi?

36:52.713 --> 36:55.799
Did I say alibi? Whereabouts.

36:55.883 --> 36:56.884
Sorry, just initial there.

36:58.260 --> 37:01.013
Just a shame it didn't come
from somebody unbiased.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.598
I mean-- Right there.

37:02.681 --> 37:04.391
I mean, the number of times
I've lied for my brother.

37:05.726 --> 37:06.935
And right down there at the bottom.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.149
And that's it.

37:12.733 --> 37:15.319
And again, Mrs. Williams,
we're so sorry for your loss.

37:25.537 --> 37:26.830
-What is going on, Tom?
-Hey!

37:27.956 --> 37:29.750
-Look what you did.
-This isn't you, all right?

37:29.833 --> 37:32.127
You don't do this kind of thing.
You tricked a widow into signing--

37:32.211 --> 37:34.379
All right, come on.
It wasn't like it was sleight of hand.

37:34.463 --> 37:35.464
Even Dad had limits.

37:35.547 --> 37:38.342
Really, yeah?
Well, lying is a form of deception too.

37:38.425 --> 37:39.551
What does that mean?

37:40.636 --> 37:41.762
Forget it, okay?

37:41.845 --> 37:44.806
Just trust that I know what I'm doing.

37:44.890 --> 37:47.976
Now look, we get a postmortem,
there's nothing there, we let it go.

37:48.060 --> 37:52.523
But I will bet on my unborn child's life
that these sisters are at the heart of it.

37:54.483 --> 37:55.484
I don't know.

37:56.944 --> 37:59.196
-Have I ever been wrong before?
-Yeah.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.031
That time you swore everyone
would sing along with me

38:01.114 --> 38:02.908
-to "Patricia the Stripper."
-Now, come on.

38:02.991 --> 38:05.452
And that time you said I wouldn't choke
if put 20 Polos in my mouth.

38:06.828 --> 38:07.913
I'm buying you a drink.

38:25.138 --> 38:27.599
Well, look at you from out of nowhere.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.268
Where the hell have you been?

38:33.647 --> 38:34.940
Okay, great.

38:37.192 --> 38:38.735
I'll meet you in 15?

38:44.116 --> 38:46.702
Yeah, so it took me a while
to get over her,

38:46.785 --> 38:50.664
especially as I was still raw
from the breakup with you, you know?

38:51.164 --> 38:53.041
I mean, I'm not really fully over her.

38:53.959 --> 38:54.960
Or you.

38:59.339 --> 39:01.633
Did I tell you she punctured
my left testicle?

39:03.218 --> 39:05.095
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

39:05.179 --> 39:06.430
She sounds nuts.

39:07.472 --> 39:08.765
Why'd she do that?

39:09.308 --> 39:10.684
I told her about you.

39:12.019 --> 39:14.146
Is it okay to off-load like this?

39:14.229 --> 39:16.064
You know, I just think, open up the attic,

39:16.148 --> 39:17.482
let the bats fly free, you know?

39:17.566 --> 39:18.942
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

39:19.484 --> 39:20.986
I'm gonna get us another pint.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.198
Why don't you get us a table out back?

39:24.281 --> 39:25.908
-Yeah.
-I think I might start smoking.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.367
Yeah.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.332
Can I get two more pints, please?

39:34.041 --> 39:36.710
Handful of those cocktail sticks,
so I can poke my eyes out.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.087
Fucking hell.

39:39.755 --> 39:41.548
I have a mate whose brother works
for the Guards.

39:42.049 --> 39:43.634
So, if he can put me through
to the inspector--

39:43.717 --> 39:46.094
Yeah, just keep your dignity
this time is all I ask.

39:46.637 --> 39:48.305
Or at least try.

39:55.604 --> 39:56.855
Give me a minute.

40:01.109 --> 40:02.361
Hey. What's up?

40:02.444 --> 40:06.031
Sorry, someone who
doesn't want me to feel shit

40:06.114 --> 40:08.283
about myself is finally calling me back.

40:09.368 --> 40:10.827
Matt, is that you?

40:10.911 --> 40:12.621
Oh, no, you're right here.

40:13.121 --> 40:15.832
-Sorry, I've been working, like--
-All day?

40:15.916 --> 40:18.001
Who needs to hear that much bass?

40:18.085 --> 40:21.046
No, my day job.
I was gonna call you. I just didn't…

40:21.129 --> 40:22.631
Well, now you don't have to.

40:24.383 --> 40:25.759
I hope you score with your date.

40:25.843 --> 40:27.928
-Oh, no. That's my brother.
-Sure.

40:28.011 --> 40:29.596
No, we have different mothers.

40:39.857 --> 40:41.567
These are from that lad over there.

40:42.484 --> 40:44.444
Make sure you give him a nice "thank you."

41:05.215 --> 41:06.508
Hello?

41:06.592 --> 41:07.968
Hey, how are you? It's Matt.

41:08.677 --> 41:09.887
That wasn't so hard, was it?

41:11.763 --> 41:13.473
You said something about getting dinner?

41:13.974 --> 41:17.269
Yeah, I know what I said,
but what do you have to say?

41:17.352 --> 41:21.231
I say maybe let's get a Chinese sometime?

41:21.315 --> 41:24.484
Well, we only have
one Chinese restaurant in town,

41:24.568 --> 41:26.278
and I'm banned from it, so…

41:26.820 --> 41:29.281
How do you get banned
from a Chinese restaurant?

41:30.365 --> 41:31.450
Break up with the owner?

41:32.951 --> 41:33.952
Oh, right.

41:34.036 --> 41:36.830
Well, I really fancy Chinese,

41:36.914 --> 41:40.667
so if you two could get back together,
maybe that would be quite convenient.

41:42.628 --> 41:43.962
What are you up to anyway?

41:45.047 --> 41:46.924
I'm just talking to you.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.085
You're early.

42:24.545 --> 42:27.923
Yeah, well. Early bird.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.718
Can we stop for sandwiches?

42:46.066 --> 42:47.943
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
-Do you wanna drive?

42:51.655 --> 42:54.408
It's just nerves. Okay?

42:55.200 --> 42:56.493
Let's try this again.

43:22.769 --> 43:23.770
Need a hand?

43:23.854 --> 43:26.315
-No, I'll manage. Would you stop--
-All right.

43:26.982 --> 43:28.901
Come on, John Paul. Hurry up.

43:31.945 --> 43:33.864
Will you wait for me please?

43:48.879 --> 43:49.922
Christ!

44:27.251 --> 44:31.547
If the box is empty, Grace,
throw the damn thing away.

44:31.630 --> 44:33.590
I've said it a hundred times.

44:38.136 --> 44:39.513
Oh, for Christ's sake.

44:42.266 --> 44:43.976
What on earth?

45:07.374 --> 45:10.961
This is unbelievable. How did you--

45:12.462 --> 45:14.882
Mam.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.135
Mam!

45:18.218 --> 45:20.846
No, you're right. I won't do that.
Yeah, come on.

45:38.822 --> 45:41.074
Oh, Mam, please don't.
She's about to start. Please.

45:42.034 --> 45:43.952
Hey, love. Everything okay?

45:44.036 --> 45:45.704
Mammy, my feet are so blistered,

45:45.787 --> 45:48.165
all my skin came off in my socks.

45:48.707 --> 45:51.168
And I've been tearing
the place apart for plasters.

45:53.045 --> 45:54.129
Where the hell are you?

45:54.213 --> 45:56.840
We're-- Look, this is--

45:56.924 --> 45:58.425
I promise it's nothing
to be concerned about.

45:58.509 --> 46:00.260
I just had this crazy idea.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.553
Where are you?

46:03.931 --> 46:07.476
B and I got tickets
to a Lizzo concert in Dublin.

46:08.268 --> 46:10.395
Are you kidding?

46:10.479 --> 46:14.399
No. They're a gift from Eva.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.739
We'll talk about it when I get home,
Grace.

46:20.822 --> 46:24.368
Good evening, Dublin!

46:24.451 --> 46:26.286
Blanaid?

46:28.747 --> 46:31.083
Bloody Garveys.

46:47.891 --> 46:49.685
I'm hungry. You?

46:51.478 --> 46:52.521
No.

47:37.608 --> 47:39.443
Been an hour since the lights went out.

47:39.526 --> 47:40.986
He's gotta be asleep by now.

47:44.281 --> 47:45.282
Okay.

48:05.177 --> 48:07.221
Are you gonna join me, or just sit there?

48:08.472 --> 48:09.723
I think maybe the latter.

48:10.349 --> 48:12.142
Which one's the latter?
I always get those confused.

48:12.226 --> 48:14.228
I can't do it, Bibi. I can't do it.

48:14.311 --> 48:17.564
-Eva, you said you were fine.
-How do I know if I'm fine or not?

48:19.191 --> 48:22.152
I mean, look at us!
What are we even doing here?

48:22.236 --> 48:24.154
You know the answer to that question.

48:26.156 --> 48:28.408
All right then. Just gonna do it alone.

48:38.544 --> 48:40.462
Are you actually
gonna let me do this on my own?

48:40.546 --> 48:43.006
I don't want you to do this at all.

49:16.582 --> 49:18.250
Frigid bitch.

49:20.544 --> 49:22.129
Come on.

49:36.643 --> 49:38.812
-Jesus Christ!
-Fuck!

49:40.230 --> 49:41.231
What's taking you so long?

49:41.315 --> 49:43.859
What's taking me so long?
Are you bored out there?

49:43.942 --> 49:45.569
I was worried about you.

49:45.652 --> 49:47.863
The matches won't light.
Give me your lighter.

49:47.946 --> 49:49.907
-What?
-Your cigarettes.

49:50.490 --> 49:52.618
-I threw them away.
-Why would you do that?

49:52.701 --> 49:54.536
Will you just calm down?

50:10.511 --> 50:11.512
Wait.

50:21.438 --> 50:22.731
No, wait. Wait.

50:25.150 --> 50:26.151
I need to finish this.

50:37.079 --> 50:38.497
Go!

51:01.270 --> 51:03.021
Shit, your phone. Turn it off!

51:05.065 --> 51:06.191
Why's he calling me?

51:29.089 --> 51:32.384
-What the actual fuck?
-What?

51:32.467 --> 51:33.886
Oh, my God. He's over there!

51:33.969 --> 51:36.763
-Why?
-He's over there! Fuck!

51:36.847 --> 51:41.935
No!

51:44.104 --> 51:48.901
No!
