ANNOUNCER: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:25.633 --> 00:28.967
<i>here's out host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:29.167 --> 00:30.500
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:30.833 --> 00:32.567
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.800
You're very kind.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:40.933 --> 00:43.700
Welcome to <i>Penn &amp; Teller, Fool Us.</i>

00:43.767 --> 00:46.900
The show with more smoke and mirrors
than Snoop Dogg's dressing room.

00:47.067 --> 00:48.400
(LAUGHING)

00:49.267 --> 00:51.700
Tonight, we have some
of the best illusionists in the world

00:51.800 --> 00:54.833
trying to earn a spot on Vegas'
longest running magic show.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.767
To earn that prize,
they have to fool the stars of that show

00:57.833 --> 00:58.933
and indeed, this one as well.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.067
They've been working together
for over 40 years,

01:01.300 --> 01:04.500
which makes them older
than the combined age of One Direction.

01:04.566 --> 01:07.633
Will you please welcome
the fabulous Penn and Teller.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.567
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:13.667 --> 01:14.733
Gentlemen.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.767
-Teller, as always, such a pleasure.
-Sir.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.000
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:21.467 --> 01:22.633
ROSS: Take a seat, gentlemen.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.400
The show can begin.

01:25.467 --> 01:26.633
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:34.067 --> 01:35.233
Okay, let's get this started.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.000
Now, it's time to meet
our first potential fooler.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.833
<i>I'm Jay Sankey,</i>
<i>and I'm from Toronto, Canada.</i>

01:45.000 --> 01:47.367
I think, like a lot of illusionists,
I'm a bit disillusioned.

01:47.667 --> 01:50.300
<i>And I find that one</i>
<i>of the best ways for me to get in touch</i>

01:50.367 --> 01:52.833
<i>with, you know, wonder and mystery</i>
<i>and all that is teaching magic.</i>

01:53.333 --> 01:55.667
If we don't share the real secrets
with anybody,

01:55.933 --> 01:57.200
magic will be dead in a generation.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.100
<i>And so that's when I really started</i>
<i>producing instructional videos</i>

02:00.167 --> 02:02.167
for my magic fans all over the world.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
I've also been really influenced
by the surreal artists,

02:05.100 --> 02:06.600
<i>people like Magritte,</i>

02:07.767 --> 02:10.400
<i>Banksy, Salvador Dal√≠.</i>

02:11.200 --> 02:13.433
I think it would be great if everybody
who watches this show

02:13.533 --> 02:16.700
<i>ultimately is inspired to learn</i>
<i>more about the art and science of magic.</i>

02:17.167 --> 02:19.167
I also hope I don't die onstage.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.833
Will you please welcome,
Mr. Jay Sankey.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.367
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-Thank you, thank you.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.100
Thank you so much. Thank you.
What a treat to be here.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.867
Good evening.
My name is Jay Sankey,

02:33.100 --> 02:35.467
and I've been lucky enough
to be performing

02:35.533 --> 02:37.567
and creating magic for more than 30 years.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.633
And people often ask me what are
the influences behind the tricks,

02:40.700 --> 02:41.867
where do I get my inspiration.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.033
And I get it from everywhere.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.900
But one thing that has inspired
a lot of my illusions over the years

02:45.967 --> 02:48.000
is the real magic of fire.

02:48.433 --> 02:51.767
I love fire. I love the way it looks,
love the way it smells,

02:52.200 --> 02:54.100
the way it tastes maybe not so much,
you know.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.933
I learned that the hard way once,

02:56.033 --> 02:58.367
but fire can do
so many really cool things.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.967
Here's a very simple example.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.433
We know that off the flame comes heat.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.267
And with heat,
if I hold the pack over it,

03:04.367 --> 03:06.867
watch what happens, just a little bit,

03:06.933 --> 03:09.467
a card will float right up out
of the pack.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.900
Now, that's just a very simple example.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.233
Let's up the ante here.

03:13.467 --> 03:16.300
We're gonna go from cards
and cardboard to something, to metal.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.733
And for this,
I'm gonna be using a stapler,

03:18.833 --> 03:21.600
or as we call it in Canada,
a lethal weapon, okay.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.033
I'm gonna use this.
I'm gonna use this in just a second.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.833
Now, how many people here,
a show of hands,

03:25.900 --> 03:28.000
how many people have ever seen,
maybe in an old movie,

03:28.333 --> 03:30.033
a set table with a tablecloth

03:30.100 --> 03:31.667
and forks and knives
and spoons and everything,

03:31.733 --> 03:34.300
and somebody yanks out the tablecloth
and everything stays on.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.167
How many people?
Yeah, of course.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.500
I'm gonna try to do that now
in a very kind of down-to-earth way.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.333
But instead of a tablecloth,
I'm gonna use a couple of cards.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.400
The cards I'm gonna use are
gonna be the seven of hearts,

03:44.500 --> 03:46.900
okay, and I'm gonna use
the queen of clubs.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.400
I'm also gonna use a dollar bill,
all right.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.567
A dollar bill here.

03:50.633 --> 03:53.133
Now, I'm gonna put the dollar bill
between the two cards

03:53.200 --> 03:56.167
and I'm gonna do this very slowly
'cause I know magicians

03:56.300 --> 03:58.933
have a way of moving very quickly,
and it's suspicious.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.333
I want you to see the bill
is truly between the two, okay.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.100
To make it... Now, of course,
if I tried to pull the dollar bill out

04:05.200 --> 04:06.633
from between the two, it'd be easy now.

04:06.700 --> 04:11.800
But if I take the stapler and put
a staple between all three,

04:11.900 --> 04:13.633
now it's gonna be a lot harder.

04:13.700 --> 04:14.833
Jonathan, would you come
over for a second?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.000
And if you can come on my right side,
please.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.600
I think you're gonna find
that a slightly better view.

04:17.666 --> 04:18.700
Thank you so much.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.067
I know the people at the back...

04:20.132 --> 04:21.733
I know the people at the back,
they can see everything,

04:21.800 --> 04:24.800
but of course, they can't see the staple,
so I'm gonna have you help me out here.

04:24.867 --> 04:26.833
Would you please feel the staple?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.767
-Is that a real staple?
-ROSS: That is a real staple.

04:28.833 --> 04:29.833
SANKEY: Okay, now watch.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.833
A little heat, this is again
the magic of fire.

04:31.900 --> 04:35.100
A little heat and I'm hoping
I'll be able to take the bill and...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.233
-ROSS: Wow.
-Just like that.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.800
-Now look, are there any tears?
-There are no...

04:39.867 --> 04:41.300
-Any tears?
-There are no tears at all.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.500
And are these two cards... Look at this.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.500
Are they truly... Examine that.
You can take it in your hands.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.733
They are stapled together.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.533
They are completely adjoined.

04:48.133 --> 04:50.900
A small miracle,
thanks to fire, a small miracle.

04:50.967 --> 04:53.267
Now, let's take it a step further.
I'm gonna show you a card trick,

04:53.333 --> 04:54.400
but it's not a card trick.

04:54.467 --> 04:55.933
It looks like a card trick,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.467
but it's actually
a public service announcement.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.500
It is. The announcement's very simple.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.533
It's simply this, do not...

05:02.600 --> 05:06.600
When you're gonna work out, always make
sure you warm up before you work out.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.400
Now, do me a favor,
separate the two cards.

05:08.467 --> 05:09.467
-Pull 'em apart?
-Pull 'em apart.

05:09.533 --> 05:10.967
This proves once again that they are...

05:11.467 --> 05:12.600
ROSS: I need to work out more.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.033
-Okay.
-There we go.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.633
They are... And I'm gonna
actually remove the staple as well,

05:16.800 --> 05:19.700
because I'm gonna have the two cards
for your entertainment pleasure,

05:19.833 --> 05:21.567
they're gonna exercise together. Watch.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.067
Both cards, they go down,
they touch their toes.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.400
Kinda weird, I know, I know.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.900
I'm a Canadian, what can I say?
They go back, they touch their heels.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.833
They bend in half, kind
of going cross-eyed, I guess, Jonathan,

05:31.900 --> 05:33.533
you could say, and back this way.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.900
Now, notice they're working out,
but they forgot to warm up.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.300
So this is the risk of tearing muscles.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.433
Sometimes, even the risk...

05:43.500 --> 05:45.800
I don't like this part,
of tearing ligaments.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.833
Now, my job as a magician
the way I see it, Jonathan,

05:48.900 --> 05:51.933
is to try to restore things,
to put the pieces back together.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.800
So look, I'm gonna take
a bunch of the pieces

05:55.633 --> 05:57.900
and I'm gonna just heat them up,
little bit there.

05:57.967 --> 06:01.200
And in fact, I'm also gonna use
some static electricity.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.467
Luckily, I've got enough hair
on my arms, like a baby gorilla,

06:03.767 --> 06:05.867
so what I can do is hopefully take
the pieces,

06:05.933 --> 06:07.300
take about half in each hand,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.833
rub a little bit there,
a little bit there,

06:09.933 --> 06:11.800
and we should see that now, yes,

06:12.500 --> 06:15.567
the cards are still scarred
and they're still hurt,

06:15.633 --> 06:18.433
but, ladies and gentlemen,
you can see both cards are now

06:19.000 --> 06:23.267
totally back together
and completely examinable.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.367
-Wow.
-For you.

06:24.433 --> 06:25.733
-Wow.
-Thank you so much.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.233
Thank you. Thank you, most kind.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.533
Thank you so much, guys.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.867
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-Thank you.

06:30.933 --> 06:35.733
Now, the last trick I'm gonna do is a bit
of a psychic connection between you and I.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.833
-Well, I felt it.
-Okay, I know, it didn't last very long.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.333
Sorry about that part.
I know, I know.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.667
But, and I'm gonna use something
that's kind of unusual.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.000
Along with the cards,
I'm actually gonna also use...

06:45.067 --> 06:47.833
I got it down here.
Sorry, where'd I put that?

06:47.900 --> 06:48.933
Oh, here it is here.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.267
-It's a sparkler.
-Okay.

06:50.733 --> 06:51.733
Now, I don't know if you...

06:51.800 --> 06:53.933
Where did you just pull
this out of, before I touch it?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.333
(LAUGHING)

06:55.433 --> 06:57.467
I know.
Let's say somewhere in the back.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.300
We'll just leave it...
Leave it very generic like that.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.800
Well, I say you've got to get it through
customs somehow, haven't you?

07:01.867 --> 07:03.200
Oh, nice, nice.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.000
Don't even bring up
the customs thing, please.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.067
I'm gonna have them take
a peek at the card.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.433
Now, very important.
A lot of magicians do this.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.800
I want you to notice two things.

07:10.933 --> 07:13.767
Number one is the cards are all different.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.700
I want you to see that they're
all different, my cards.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.567
It's a lot easier
if they're the same card.

07:18.633 --> 07:20.600
A lot less practice, believe me.
It really is.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.400
Okay, so look,
I'm gonna spread out the cards.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.033
-Okay.
-I want you to touch any one you want.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.233
-Any one?
-Any one, doesn't matter.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.567
-Okay, how about that one there?
-Okay, now I'm not even gonna remove

07:27.633 --> 07:28.800
the card from the pack.

07:28.867 --> 07:31.533
I'm gonna leave it sticking
out of the middle of the pack.

07:31.633 --> 07:32.767
We're not gonna take it out,

07:32.833 --> 07:34.233
but I'm gonna ask you
to take a quick peek.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.600
-Okay.
-A quick peek at the card.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.033
-Remember it, keep it in mind.
-Okay, got it.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.200
-Will you remember it?
-Yes.

07:38.267 --> 07:41.033
-The suit, the number, everything?
-Yes. Yes, all of it.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.100
-Okay, all...
-I remember everything about that card.

07:43.167 --> 07:44.367
Now watch, let's try this.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.500
I'm gonna take the sparkler.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.500
-He's thinking about the card.
-Yes.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.333
They were all different.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.567
Here we go.
There we go.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.433
I know you want to sing
<i>Happy Birthday,</i> right?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.533
You immediately want to sing.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.900
Let's see, I'm gonna try to find his card.

07:55.967 --> 07:58.333
I'm gonna take and stick it right through.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.900
Oh, we're doing it.
We're... Yes, yes, look.

08:02.233 --> 08:04.233
It's going through the middle of the deck,

08:04.300 --> 08:06.500
and I'm gonna try
to see if I can pull his one,

08:06.567 --> 08:08.333
it's burning...
It's burning my fingers.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
It's right... Like this, look.
Look, look, look.

08:10.500 --> 08:15.967
Burnt, burnt right through every card
except for one card.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.533
One card.
What was the card?

08:18.867 --> 08:21.533
The card was the jack of spades.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
-You're sure?
-I'm pretty sure.

08:24.067 --> 08:27.633
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I found...

08:28.567 --> 08:31.433
-The jack of spades.
-Wow.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.400
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

08:33.500 --> 08:35.633
-SANKEY: Thank you so much.
-Jay Sankey, ladies and gentlemen.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.100
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.533
-Thank you.
-Okay.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.900
So, you know how this goes, Jay.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.000
Penn and Teller
are gonna have a little chat.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.100
They're gonna think about it.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.600
And while they're thinking,
some of the things we just saw you do

08:45.667 --> 08:48.333
aren't like your standard tricks.
They're things that you have invented.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, inventing is a...
I mean, I love performing,

08:51.100 --> 08:55.700
but ever since I was a very young kid,
inventing has been a big part of who I am.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.967
So, yeah, everything here
is one of my original tricks.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.133
I'm not a big fan of sort of using
other people's magic.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.267
If you were to fool Penn and Teller,
what does that do to your standing?

09:03.333 --> 09:05.733
Well, it super exciting. It's awesome.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.033
You go... I mean, these guys,
yeah, they've seen it all,

09:08.100 --> 09:09.967
they've done it all,
and they even have a show where,

09:10.033 --> 09:11.767
you know, they see so many magicians try.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.933
So if you can pull it off,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.633
frankly,
I think it might be a bit of a fluke.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.867
Okay, they have a consensus,
whether or not it's right,

09:16.933 --> 09:17.967
we'll now find out.

09:18.033 --> 09:20.800
-Penn.
-Well, you know, one of the things that

09:20.867 --> 09:23.767
magicians hardly ever bother doing,

09:24.233 --> 09:28.500
and it's to their detriment,
is giving an overall theme.

09:28.733 --> 09:32.000
Just putting a candle in the middle
of the table and saying,

09:32.067 --> 09:34.967
"This all has to do with fire,"
is fabulous.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.533
-Already we love you.
-Thank you.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.567
I think you know
that we know a rising card,

09:39.633 --> 09:42.700
although you adding the candle
to it is really, really nice.

09:43.033 --> 09:46.467
The staple thing
of the bill between the cards,

09:47.600 --> 09:51.433
we saw a little bit of larceny
at the beginning of this that...

09:51.500 --> 09:52.967
That helped you do that trick.

09:53.033 --> 09:55.667
"Helped" is maybe too weak a word.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.900
Had you do that trick
but it was beautiful.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.767
I loved the fact that you created it.

09:59.867 --> 10:04.200
One of the things I loved the most
is I love how you look

10:04.700 --> 10:07.567
when you show off the hair on your arm.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.033
You know what I'm talking about.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.900
I loved that very much.

-It's a good...
-Is this...

10:14.433 --> 10:15.700
Is this a private moment
that we should...

10:15.767 --> 10:16.767
Oh, it's a private, yes.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.033
PENN: It's a nice pose, isn't it?

10:18.100 --> 10:19.167
He's being very gentle.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.400
You looked very, very good
when you posed like that.

10:21.467 --> 10:22.733
-SANKEY: Thanks.
-It's very attractive...

10:22.800 --> 10:24.000
-SANKEY: Thank you.
-Especially the way

10:24.067 --> 10:25.433
you held it out just like this.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.933
-Remember that?
-I try, brother, I try.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.700
Yeah, I remember that, yeah.

10:28.767 --> 10:32.867
We have an idea that the Jedis
were working with you on the...

10:33.167 --> 10:35.633
-On the final sparkler trick.
-A little bit.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.667
And I'm so happy
that I can say this on TV,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.733
but I'm very happy

10:42.000 --> 10:44.767
and maybe other people
in your life are, too,

10:44.900 --> 10:48.000
with the way you masked the gash.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.833
-Whoa.
-PENN: It was beautiful...

10:49.900 --> 10:51.600
-Whoa.
-PENN: The way you masked the gash.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.133
-Whoa, there's a phrase.
-We loved the whole routine.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.833
-It was really, really wonderful.
-SANKEY: Thank you.

10:54.900 --> 10:58.333
We don't feel anything completely
fooled us, but boy, we loved ya.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.867
Thank you so much, thank you.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.967
-Wonderful job.
-Very kind, thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, Penn.
Thank you, Teller.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.967
Wow, so, Jay,
let me just check.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.067
You're fairly confident
that the things that Penn said

11:11.133 --> 11:14.500
culminating in you masking a gash,
he's all aboveboard.

11:14.567 --> 11:15.967
-He knows what you did.
-Right.

11:16.033 --> 11:17.200
And they busted you.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.467
Yeah, my sense is that
he's totally in the ballpark.

11:20.533 --> 11:23.933
You know, we could be more articulate
and more specific,

11:24.033 --> 11:26.600
but my sense is if Penn and Teller feel
they're in the ballpark,

11:26.667 --> 11:27.967
they're probably in the ballpark.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.333
They're probably right there
in the diamond. Ladies and gentlemen.

you were following in their footsteps?

17:21.599 --> 17:22.599
Oh, certainly.

So I would study different types
of magic then my dad was famous for.

So he was famous for doing
card manipulation when he was a kid,

17:29.167 --> 17:31.133
so I studied the balls,
like you saw in the video.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.700
Yeah, yeah. So you would
deliberately mark out your own territory.

I tried.

We're gonna go to Penn and Teller.

and did he fool you?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.000
-Young...
-(LAUGHING)

17:58.733 --> 18:02.033
It fooled him absolutely completely.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.200
And there's a few things
that we notice, you know.

18:05.267 --> 18:07.067
When you push a...

18:08.033 --> 18:11.000
Box that's a little bigger
than maybe it needs to be

18:11.100 --> 18:13.933
back against a curtain
that's a little further away

18:14.000 --> 18:16.633
and maybe there's a little extra
time to sign.

18:16.867 --> 18:20.233
And we've done sword boxes before,

18:20.300 --> 18:24.000
and we've seen all sorts of ways
to do sword boxes

18:24.300 --> 18:25.600
and we know...

18:26.433 --> 18:28.533
Lots of ways that people have done tricks

18:28.600 --> 18:30.900
that are slightly inferior to this,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.933
and then at the end of a trick

18:34.233 --> 18:37.467
you produce Mark Wilson

21:18.433 --> 21:20.400
by creating something in two dimensions

21:20.467 --> 21:22.533
and then bringing it into real life.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.267
Watch.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.967
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

21:40.667 --> 21:42.300
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

21:49.300 --> 21:52.033
Now of course, I realize that
the screen is a little small,

21:52.100 --> 21:54.767
and I'm going to be doing something
that involves a few more apps.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.167
So fortunately, I came prepared.

21:57.300 --> 22:00.100
I brought along with me
my own personal phone.

22:01.367 --> 22:03.167
(LAUGHING)

22:03.833 --> 22:06.767
Yes, it's a smartphone. It's the 7-plus.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.967
Although, in Penn's hands,
it would be more of a two and a half.

22:12.267 --> 22:14.467
For what I'm about to do,
I require a little bit of assistance,

22:14.533 --> 22:17.133
and I thought who better to help
than our very own host, Mr. Jonathan Ross.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.167
-My pleasure.
-Are you busy? Do you have a minute?

22:19.233 --> 22:21.700
I'm very happy and excited to help.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.000
Come take a seat right here
if you wouldn't mind.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.300
-Sit here?
-Take a seat, yep.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.833
Now, Jonathan, as host of <i>Fool Us,</i>

22:25.900 --> 22:28.767
I know that you've seen
your fair share of card tricks.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.900
So today, we'll be performing
an app trick.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.733
I'm going to select one
of these apps at random

22:34.800 --> 22:37.200
and place it over here
on the microphone stand.

22:37.267 --> 22:39.533
That will serve as my prediction.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.300
Jonathan will then be
choosing a random app

22:42.500 --> 22:45.667
from a similar set of apps right here.

22:46.167 --> 22:49.500
Hopefully, the app that Jonathan
chooses at random

22:49.567 --> 22:51.500
will match my prediction.

22:52.433 --> 22:54.900
Now, if they don't match,
Jonathan messed up.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.400
(LAUGHING)

22:56.633 --> 22:59.300
Now, Jonathan, I don't want
you to see my prediction, all right,

22:59.367 --> 23:01.367
over here on the prediction stand,

23:01.433 --> 23:02.467
so I am going to...

23:02.533 --> 23:03.667
If you don't mind,

23:03.733 --> 23:05.167
I'm going to blindfold you
for the next few minutes.

23:05.233 --> 23:06.900
I have a blindfold for you to wear.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.400
Go ahead and just slip that on for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.233
I'm open to new experiences.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.033
WATSON: Perfect, there you go.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.833
Jonathan, I want you to know I have
your complete comfort

23:15.900 --> 23:17.200
and customer satisfaction in mind.

23:17.267 --> 23:18.367
Relax, take a break.

23:19.033 --> 23:20.100
-Oh, thank you.
-WATSON: There you go.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.367
Feel free to take a nap.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.800
(LAUGHING)

23:23.667 --> 23:25.067
Time for me to make my prediction.

23:25.733 --> 23:27.233
Let's go with...

23:27.800 --> 23:30.600
Let's see, I think will go
with this one today.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.000
I want everyone to remember it.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.067
Commit it to memory.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.300
I'm going to place it over here

23:37.100 --> 23:38.100
in the stand.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.067
Now, Jonathan...

23:42.433 --> 23:43.633
Is going to be choosing...

23:44.700 --> 23:45.800
A random app

23:46.433 --> 23:49.700
from this set of apps.

23:51.533 --> 23:52.700
(LAUGHING)

23:54.000 --> 23:55.933
All different choices. Jonathan.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.267
Jonathan, you can wake up now.

23:57.333 --> 23:58.567
-Jonathan, wake up.
-It wasn't me.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.167
Welcome back.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.933
Go ahead and remove
your blindfold now, if you don't mind.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.300
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

24:04.367 --> 24:05.733
Now, Jonathan, I know that

24:05.800 --> 24:07.967
you're probably aware
that some magicians at this point

24:08.033 --> 24:10.100
may try to make you choose a certain card.

24:10.167 --> 24:11.667
You know, try to force you
to make a choice.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.733
I want you to know this is
a completely free choice.

24:13.867 --> 24:16.233
Truly, pick an app, any app.

24:16.300 --> 24:17.933
-Any one of these?
-Just go ahead, reach in there, yep.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.133
Don't look, just take it out.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.433
-This one.
-That one right there.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.733
Now, don't look at it yet,
just take it out.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.600
Perfect. Allow me to recap.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.067
I have chosen one app,

24:25.133 --> 24:27.867
one app only, which has been
resting here on the prediction stand,

24:27.933 --> 24:30.667
chosen from a whole bunch
of different apps on the phone.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.033
Now of course, Jonathan had
a lot of different choices as well.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.500
We've got 24 apps here.

24:34.633 --> 24:37.567
Jonathan, I want you to now say
the name of the app out loud.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.533
Angry Birds.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.733
(LAUGHING)

24:42.300 --> 24:43.467
-Seriously?
-You want to look?

24:43.867 --> 24:44.900
Can I see?

24:46.833 --> 24:47.967
(LAUGHS)

24:49.600 --> 24:50.667
Uh...

24:50.800 --> 24:51.933
Angry Magician.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.900
-(LAUGHING)
-Just...

24:54.967 --> 24:58.933
Just as well, 'cause I may or may not have
chosen Angry Birds as well,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.367
-ladies and gentlemen.
-Wow.

25:00.433 --> 25:01.733
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

25:01.833 --> 25:04.000
You really had me there
for a second, Jonathan.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.100
You really... You really had me.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.867
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

25:12.167 --> 25:13.800
That was good. Thank you, Trigg.

25:13.900 --> 25:15.633
(LAUGHING)

25:15.700 --> 25:16.700
Very good.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.967
Okay, well, let's go front and center here

25:19.133 --> 25:20.267
while Penn and Teller deliberate

25:20.333 --> 25:22.667
and they talk about how you did
what you did and whether they know.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.867
Let me ask you.
I've never met a Trigg before.

25:25.933 --> 25:27.467
Oh, yeah, well, it's...

25:27.600 --> 25:30.767
It's funny, in school,
math was my least favorite subject.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.267
It's a little bit ironic.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.867
But it's a Norwegian name.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.233
So it's your real name,
it's not a nickname.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.433
No, it's literally my real name.

25:36.667 --> 25:37.767
I'll tell you, it's interesting.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.867
The name Trigg in Norse means
trustworthy and truthful,

25:40.933 --> 25:42.367
which is also ironic.

25:42.433 --> 25:43.533
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
Given that I'm a magician.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.800
It's like the path was chosen
for you there.

25:45.867 --> 25:46.867
WATSON: I guess so.

25:46.967 --> 25:48.000
I think they had long enough.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.167
Let's go over now to Penn and Teller.

25:49.233 --> 25:50.367
Why don't we start with you, Penn?

25:50.467 --> 25:51.533
Okay.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.733
(LAUGHING)

25:53.433 --> 25:55.333
Great routine. We love...

25:55.433 --> 25:56.467
Love bringing...

25:56.567 --> 25:57.967
Bringing technology in.

25:58.267 --> 26:02.033
I don't know if you're old enough
or lucky enough

26:02.233 --> 26:03.533
to have met Billy McComb.

26:03.733 --> 26:05.267
Never in person,
but I'm a big fan of his work.

26:05.333 --> 26:06.633
PENN: We were very good friends.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.133
-Terrific.
-Back in the 90s,

26:08.300 --> 26:10.533
we used a thing he did
called the McComb-ical deck,

26:10.667 --> 26:13.033
-which is what you're doing mostly here.
-Yes.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.300
But a very magnetic version of it.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.867
And you did...
The double punch lines

26:17.933 --> 26:19.700
are always great in a magic trick,

26:19.867 --> 26:22.433
to give one punch line
that completely sells it

26:22.500 --> 26:25.033
and then turn it around the other way,
bringing out a failure.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.733
But the thing I liked most about this,
I think,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.800
is the fact that quick-change

26:30.233 --> 26:33.067
is a really, really magical thing

26:33.200 --> 26:36.000
and it's never used enough in magic.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.100
And using a principal of quick-change

26:39.233 --> 26:40.567
in order to do a...

26:40.767 --> 26:43.800
Another punch line on top of it,
was a wonderful thing.

26:43.867 --> 26:45.733
But I think we got all the...

26:45.800 --> 26:47.467
All the details, what you did,

26:47.533 --> 26:51.133
and I like to see it as kind of a tribute
to the great Billy McComb,

26:51.200 --> 26:52.400
who, for those of you who don't know,

26:52.467 --> 26:54.733
is one of the greatest comedy magicians
who ever lived.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.067
-A fabulous guy.
-WATSON: I hope I did him justice.

26:56.133 --> 26:57.133
ROSS: Let me just check.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.133
What Penn said there,
was that enough for you

26:59.200 --> 27:01.533
to accept that they do know
what was going on up here?

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
-Yes, I think so.
-Okay.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.333
Well, you did it phenomenally.

27:04.933 --> 27:06.267
They know their stuff.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.333
-Thank you, Penn.
-PENN: Thank you.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.667
You were great. It was a great show,
wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.367
Join me in saying thank you
to Trigg Watson.

27:12.433 --> 27:13.900
-Thank you.
-Okay, thank you, sir.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.033
Thank you. I'll have all these.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.633
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

27:17.100 --> 27:19.067
Let's meet our next potential fooler.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.200
Hi, my name is Jen Kramer,

27:23.267 --> 27:26.700
<i>and I live right here</i>
<i>in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

27:28.033 --> 27:30.133
<i>So when I went to Yale,</i>
<i>I became a theater major</i>

27:30.200 --> 27:32.967
because they didn't have a major
in witchcraft and wizardry.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.500
<i>I figured Yale is basically Hogwarts.</i>
<i>I'll join the magic society,</i>

27:36.567 --> 27:40.000
<i>and I show up on campus and it turns out</i>
<i>there wasn't a magic society.</i>

27:40.100 --> 27:41.900
<i>So I decided to start one,</i>

27:41.967 --> 27:44.433
and I'm proud to say,
it's still going strong.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.067
So when I was 14 years old,

27:48.133 --> 27:52.700
<i>I was dreaming of being in Las Vegas</i>
<i>one day performing on a big stage.</i>

27:52.933 --> 27:54.333
<i>Now, that I'm doing my show here,</i>

27:54.433 --> 27:56.533
<i>there'll be girls who come up</i>
<i>after the show and say,</i>

27:56.600 --> 27:59.667
<i>"You know, I never considered magic,</i>
<i>but then I saw the show</i>

27:59.767 --> 28:02.167
<i>"and, you know, now,</i>
<i>I think magic is so cool."</i>

28:02.233 --> 28:04.433
And that, to me, is so rewarding.

28:04.533 --> 28:05.867
I love that about magic.

28:06.533 --> 28:08.200
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

28:11.200 --> 28:13.533
This next performer went to Yale,

28:13.600 --> 28:16.100
which is an adorable American version
of real colleges,

28:16.167 --> 28:17.967
like Oxford and Cambridge.

28:18.033 --> 28:20.367
Will you please welcome, Jen Kramer.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.367
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

28:28.433 --> 28:29.533
Hi, everyone.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.433
Thank you so much for that warm welcome.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.100
It is wonderful to be here with you all.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.933
I did just graduate from Yale University,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.033
and now I'm doing...
Thank you.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.633
Now I'm doing magic full time.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.367
Or, Mom and Dad, if you're watching,

28:42.433 --> 28:45.133
I am a brain surgeon just like I told you.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.833
I do these card tricks
to keep my fingers nimble.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.000
-(LAUGHING)
-Thank you.

28:51.133 --> 28:54.133
And I'd like to show you right now
one of my all-time favorite card tricks.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.200
Jonathan, would you join me on stage?

28:56.267 --> 28:58.733
Let's hear it for Jonathan Ross,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:59.167 --> 29:00.833
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

29:00.900 --> 29:02.367
Thank you very much, Jonathan.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.800
So great to meet you.

29:04.233 --> 29:07.133
Jonathan, I have a deck of cards
here in random order.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.933
I'd like you to please take
a look at that deck of cards

29:09.000 --> 29:10.333
all mixed up there.

29:10.633 --> 29:11.633
Now, Jonathan,

29:11.800 --> 29:14.467
I'm going to give you some
very explicit instructions.

29:14.533 --> 29:17.900
I need you to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

29:17.967 --> 29:19.933
-Can you do that, Jonathan?
-I will try my best.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.700
Excellent. I know you can do it.

29:21.767 --> 29:22.800
-You're married, right?
-Yes.

29:22.867 --> 29:24.533
-You know how to follow instructions well.
-Yes.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.867
All right.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.367
Here's what we'll do.
We'll divide the cards

29:28.433 --> 29:29.867
so they're half-and-half-ish.

29:29.933 --> 29:31.767
You're gonna take one half.
I'm gonna take one half.

29:31.833 --> 29:33.000
Which half would you like?

29:33.067 --> 29:34.300
This half.

29:34.367 --> 29:35.367
That half. Go for it.

29:35.433 --> 29:37.033
Give that half a shuffle, if you would.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.633
Really mix it up well there.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.133
-More shuffle?
-However much you'd like.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.800
-It's up to you.
-They're fully shuffled.

29:43.967 --> 29:45.533
Great. Now, I'm going to turn around

29:45.600 --> 29:48.067
so that I can't possibly see what
you're doing, Jonathan,

29:48.167 --> 29:49.467
but what I would like you to do

29:49.633 --> 29:51.033
is please spread the cards out,

29:51.100 --> 29:52.133
you can see, just like this.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.867
Spread the cards out so that
you can see all of the options.

29:54.967 --> 29:55.967
Yep.

29:56.167 --> 29:59.500
And then I'd like you to think
of any one of those cards that you see.

29:59.567 --> 30:01.067
-Okay.
-Have you got one in mind?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.933
I've got most in my mind right now,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.767
but I'll go back to just one.

30:04.833 --> 30:06.700
Okay, I've changed it.
I've got one in my mind.

30:06.767 --> 30:08.933
KRAMER: You've got one in your mind
and you'll remember that card?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.067
I'm gonna try my best.

30:10.133 --> 30:11.800
Terrific. All right, Jonathan.

30:11.867 --> 30:13.267
I'll grab back the cards.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.400
We'll shuffle them all together, in fact.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.900
And are you ready
for your next instructions?

30:17.967 --> 30:19.200
-Yes.
-You've been doing very well

30:19.267 --> 30:20.833
-following instructions so far.
-Thank you.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.733
Make sure they're nice and mixed up.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.900
Would you hold out...
You're right-handed, yes?

30:25.067 --> 30:26.767
Would you hold out
your left hand actually,

30:26.833 --> 30:28.700
because I'm going to have
you deal some cards.

30:28.767 --> 30:29.800
ROSS: Okay.

30:29.900 --> 30:32.333
All right, terrific.
This is so that the cards are entirely

30:32.400 --> 30:33.900
out of my control right now.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.033
Jonathan,
you've got the cards right there.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.133
I have the power.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.000
Now, what I'm going to ask you to do

30:38.067 --> 30:40.733
is please deal the cards facedown

30:41.300 --> 30:42.567
-onto my palm...
-Okay.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.133
Starting from the top of the deck,
until I say stop.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.967
All right, and by the way, now that the
cards are completely out of my control,

30:49.033 --> 30:51.200
you can let everyone know,
what's the card you're just thinking of.

30:51.367 --> 30:53.967
I thought of the eight of diamonds.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.900
-The eight of diamonds.
-Yes.

30:56.133 --> 30:57.133
All right, well,

30:57.200 --> 30:59.967
please go ahead and I'd like
you to start dealing down cards there

31:00.100 --> 31:01.167
until I say stop.

31:03.133 --> 31:04.200
Oh, stop.

31:05.433 --> 31:07.433
It was quick,
but it was good while it lasted.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.367
(LAUGHING)

31:10.667 --> 31:11.733
I've...

31:11.967 --> 31:14.067
I've heard that far too often in my life.

31:14.467 --> 31:15.600
(LAUGHING)

31:15.800 --> 31:17.867
Now, Jonathan, just to recap
here for a moment.

31:17.933 --> 31:19.267
You looked at the cards,

31:19.333 --> 31:21.900
you were thinking in your mind
of a single card.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.267
You shuffled the deck.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.967
You dealt the cards.

31:25.167 --> 31:26.200
Absolutely.

31:26.333 --> 31:28.667
Right here, the card you're
thinking of, Jonathan.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.467
The eight of diamonds.

31:30.533 --> 31:32.500
Eight of diamonds. Let's see how we did.
Go for it.

31:32.633 --> 31:34.900
Wow! Holy moly.

31:34.967 --> 31:36.333
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

31:36.800 --> 31:38.267
Thank you very much.

31:38.367 --> 31:40.600
-Thank you, Jonathan.
-That was fabulous.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.000
No idea how that...

31:42.500 --> 31:43.967
'Cause I had hold of them
all the time there.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.500
So Penn and Teller are gonna talk

31:45.567 --> 31:47.100
and work out if they can work out
how you did that.

31:47.167 --> 31:48.200
I was kind of on top of it there.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.167
I couldn't see anything. I had no idea.

31:50.233 --> 31:51.600
Let me ask you about
you're schooling, though.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.533
-Sure.
-You speak four languages, is that right?

31:53.700 --> 31:55.367
-I do.
-What are those languages?

31:55.500 --> 31:59.233
I speak English, French, Spanish,
and Swahili.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.800
Wow. Well, I can see why you'd want
to learn some of them,

32:01.867 --> 32:03.933
-but why French?
-(LAUGHING)

32:04.767 --> 32:06.400
-I know. Nobody speaks that language.
-That's crazy.

32:08.233 --> 32:11.133
What's the situation for you
being a woman in magic?

32:11.467 --> 32:14.367
What are the advantages,
and what are the disadvantages of that?

32:14.567 --> 32:17.000
You know, I think there are
advantages and disadvantages.

32:17.067 --> 32:20.833
You know, advantages being that,
I guess, you sort of stand out

32:20.900 --> 32:22.433
just by nature of being a woman.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.367
Disadvantages also being

32:24.433 --> 32:26.700
that things can be a little bit more
challenging.

32:26.767 --> 32:29.800
You know, the magic books are written
for men

32:29.867 --> 32:31.767
and men's clothing and that type of thing.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.233
Yes, because if you're wearing
a big jacket,

32:33.300 --> 32:36.333
then you could conceal stuff more easily
than coming out with bare sleeves.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.900
Exactly, exactly.

32:37.967 --> 32:39.433
Okay, well, I think they're ready now.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.800
They've deliberated long enough.

32:40.900 --> 32:43.367
-Penn?
-Well, you know, the temptation,

32:43.933 --> 32:46.633
because women in magic are so rare

32:47.067 --> 32:50.600
is to talk about how refreshing it is
to see someone with a couple of

32:50.933 --> 32:52.300
X chromosomes up there,

32:52.733 --> 32:56.267
but I don't think that's
the most interesting thing about this.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.333
The most interesting thing about
this is not your gender

32:59.567 --> 33:01.367
but rather that...

33:01.533 --> 33:05.700
What you did is a trick, and the audience
probably can't tell the difference.

33:05.767 --> 33:07.067
What you did is a trick

33:07.133 --> 33:09.233
was predominately intellectual.

33:09.967 --> 33:12.767
And a lot of the people that
come out here and do tricks

33:12.833 --> 33:14.167
it's finger flinging,

33:14.233 --> 33:16.100
it's what I would call juggling.

33:16.467 --> 33:20.333
It's a huge amount of physical practice.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.033
What you were doing there

33:22.167 --> 33:24.300
is a huge amount of mental practice.

33:24.667 --> 33:27.200
As a matter of fact, when you got
to the place when you had to do

33:27.300 --> 33:30.967
a shuffle that...
Well, you had to do your shuffle...

33:31.100 --> 33:32.500
-Yes.
-You could see

33:32.567 --> 33:34.700
that your handling of the cards

33:34.833 --> 33:37.233
was not as smooth as
your handling of your mind.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.100
I'm gonna say a couple of names to you.

33:40.167 --> 33:41.700
There's a great Spanish magician

33:41.833 --> 33:43.767
named Juan Tamariz

33:43.833 --> 33:47.200
and there's another great Chicago magician
named Aronson.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.733
And I bet that either of those two guys

33:49.967 --> 33:52.733
have a pretty good idea
of the capacity you have.

33:52.800 --> 33:57.667
Now, I wanna tell you, my favorite kinds
of card tricks use this technique,

33:57.733 --> 33:59.767
'cause I love it when it's up here
instead of here.

34:00.367 --> 34:02.033
-Okay.
-We got a pretty good idea?

34:02.233 --> 34:04.233
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

34:04.367 --> 34:06.133
I'm assuming that that kind of...

34:06.200 --> 34:07.800
The codes and the names mentioned there,
that's enough

34:07.867 --> 34:10.233
for you to believe that they
know what you were doing?

34:10.300 --> 34:11.533
-It is.
-It was all done up here,

34:11.600 --> 34:12.667
Jonathan, all done up here.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.367
That's why I was so good to work with,

34:14.433 --> 34:15.800
-'cause nothing was being done up here.
-(LAUGHING)

34:16.400 --> 34:17.632
ROSS: But you were fantastic.

34:17.699 --> 34:19.800
It blew us all away for sure,
even if you didn't fool them.

34:19.867 --> 34:21.167
Jen was wonderful, wasn't she?

34:21.233 --> 34:23.000
-Jen Kramer, ladies and gentlemen.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

34:23.067 --> 34:24.500
That was fabulous.

34:24.567 --> 34:25.900
Jen Kramer.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.500
Thank you very much.

34:30.233 --> 34:33.132
Out of all of our acts tonight,
I feel confident in saying,

34:33.199 --> 34:37.300
our final one is without a doubt our most
famous and definitely our best looking.

34:37.433 --> 34:41.067
It's also their show, so they may or
may not have made me say that last part.

34:41.132 --> 34:42.367
Okay, it's time to see them do a trick.

34:42.433 --> 34:45.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
go crazy for Penn and Teller.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.333
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

34:51.467 --> 34:52.667
We'd like to...

34:52.933 --> 34:55.500
We'd like to address a classic of magic,

34:55.567 --> 34:56.900
or actually the classic of magic.

34:56.967 --> 34:59.600
As a matter of fact,
it's the clich√© of magic.

34:59.667 --> 35:02.167
It's a clich√© that when someone
does something impossible

35:02.233 --> 35:04.300
they've pulled a rabbit out of their hat.

35:04.367 --> 35:07.667
And it is the icon of magic

35:07.733 --> 35:11.867
to have a 19th-century magician
with a top hat and a wand, a little tap,

35:11.933 --> 35:13.633
and a live rabbit coming out.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.033
And every magician does this.

35:15.100 --> 35:18.500
Every magician we've had
out here, as part of their routine,

35:18.567 --> 35:20.100
they will pull a rabbit out of their hat.

35:20.167 --> 35:23.233
Every birthday party magician you see,
every backyard magician,

35:23.300 --> 35:25.867
every magician on Broadway,
or on the strip... No.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.233
No.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.967
It's a really rare trick.

35:29.033 --> 35:31.333
It's the clich√© of magic, and yet,

35:31.533 --> 35:34.800
I may see more magic than you,
and I've never seen it,

35:34.933 --> 35:35.967
never once seen it.

35:36.033 --> 35:37.800
Teller sees more magic than I do,

35:37.967 --> 35:40.267
he's never seen it either.
We've never seen that simple trick

35:40.500 --> 35:42.100
of a top hat,

35:42.167 --> 35:46.600
a wand, a couple of taps, and out of there
comes a live rabbit.

35:46.667 --> 35:48.400
There's a few reasons you haven't seen it.

35:48.533 --> 35:51.367
One is it's become an anachronism.

35:51.633 --> 35:54.300
In the 19th century
when this became a clich√©,

35:54.600 --> 35:58.700
many men wore top hats to the theater.
They're called opera hats.

35:58.767 --> 36:00.400
They fold up to go under the seat,

36:00.467 --> 36:03.567
but now, it's very, very rare
to see a man or a woman

36:03.900 --> 36:07.533
wearing a top hat
in 21st-century Las Vegas.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.433
Maybe when there's cosplay in town

36:09.500 --> 36:12.400
or maybe there's somebody
who's into steam punk,

36:12.467 --> 36:13.667
we'll see one or two.

36:13.733 --> 36:15.900
Mostly we see a cowboy hat now and again

36:15.967 --> 36:18.733
and a baseball hat or a cap.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.867
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna loan this to you, if I may.

36:21.933 --> 36:24.133
And just, you know, make sure
you fold it up, open it up,

36:24.200 --> 36:25.267
fold it up, open it up,

36:25.333 --> 36:27.867
put it on your head,
kinda make it your own for a little while.

36:27.933 --> 36:29.800
I'm loaning it to you right here.

36:29.867 --> 36:33.133
So since they can't borrow a top hat,

36:33.200 --> 36:36.600
they'll use something else.
They'll use what magicians call a silk,

36:36.667 --> 36:38.700
which is really just a handkerchief.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.467
They could do a lot of routines
with those.

36:40.533 --> 36:42.500
There's a lot of magic developed for this.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.633
And they'll have a picture of a top hat
on a silk

36:45.700 --> 36:48.233
and they'll pull out a rabbit.

36:48.367 --> 36:52.033
But it's a rabbit pulled out
of a picture of a top hat,

36:52.100 --> 36:55.400
not a top hat,
and it's also not a real rabbit.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.633
This is what's called a kicker.

36:57.733 --> 37:00.500
It's sold in magic stores, very expensive.

37:00.667 --> 37:03.200
It's a spring covered in fur,

37:03.267 --> 37:05.933
and if you puppeteer it properly,
which Teller does,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.900
at least in a long shot,
kinda looks like a...

37:09.067 --> 37:11.533
Like a real rabbit.
Makes the magic much easier,

37:11.667 --> 37:13.033
'cause you can compress this.

37:13.167 --> 37:15.400
You can kind of palm it.
You can also hide it up your sleeve.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.667
It's easier to handle this,

37:16.733 --> 37:20.067
and it also deals with another problem,
another anachronism,

37:20.333 --> 37:22.233
which is in the 19th century

37:22.467 --> 37:25.467
we didn't really care very much
how animals were treated.

37:25.533 --> 37:29.300
But the sphere of compassion
for humanity has grown,

37:29.367 --> 37:31.900
and in the 21st century we insist,

37:32.067 --> 37:33.667
magicians and audiences alike,

37:33.933 --> 37:37.067
that a life is treated with compassion,

37:37.233 --> 37:38.500
dignity and respect.

37:38.633 --> 37:43.533
So it makes it really hard
to do the rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick.

37:45.433 --> 37:46.433
(LAUGHING)

37:47.167 --> 37:48.700
Does anybody here have a top hat?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.267
Anybody have a top hat in the audience?

37:50.433 --> 37:51.500
Is there a top hat?

37:51.700 --> 37:52.767
You have a top hat.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.233
Could you come up here please?
Right up here, yeah.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.733
Bring your top hat with you
right up here, please.

37:55.800 --> 37:56.967
Thank you so much.

37:57.867 --> 37:59.567
-What is your name, please?
-Kat.

37:59.633 --> 38:01.000
Hello, Kat, my name is Penn.

38:01.133 --> 38:03.267
This is Teller right here.
Kat.

38:03.467 --> 38:05.200
And, Kat, take a look at that top hat,
huh?

38:05.300 --> 38:07.567
May I borrow the top hat back
for a moment, please, Kat?

38:07.633 --> 38:08.633
Thank you so much.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.233
And now, Kat, did you get a chance
to fold it up like this?

38:11.300 --> 38:12.600
-I did.
-And you opened it up like that,

38:12.667 --> 38:14.733
you did all that?
Did you look around on the inside?

38:14.800 --> 38:15.933
-Yes, I did.
-It's completely empty,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.567
'cause I'm gonna show this to the camera,
but it's black on black.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.833
So I take a magic wand.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.633
Here's the trick that
you wanted to see, the <i>clich√©.</i>

38:22.700 --> 38:24.733
Borrowed top hat, borrowed from Kat.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.300
Couple of taps right here.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.200
Circular gesture,

38:28.267 --> 38:31.400
and then out of that top hat
comes a live...

38:31.467 --> 38:32.700
-You can touch her.
-Really?

38:32.767 --> 38:34.400
He's so cute.

38:34.467 --> 38:37.567
That's Wossy the Rabbit right there,
Wossy.

38:37.633 --> 38:38.867
-Say hi to Wossy.
-Hi, Wossy. Hi!

38:38.933 --> 38:40.433
Is that a real rabbit right there?

38:40.500 --> 38:42.867
-Hi, it is, oh, my God.
-There it is the classic of magic,

38:42.933 --> 38:44.900
a live rabbit out of a borrowed top hat.

38:44.967 --> 38:46.367
-Thank you so much, Kat.
-It's so cute and fluffy.

38:46.433 --> 38:48.600
Right there, watch your step.
Right back there.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.800
That is our rabbit Wossy.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600

38:52.667 --> 38:55.300
Wasn't that great, ladies and gentlemen?
Penn and Teller.

-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-Phenomenal close to the show,

38:59.000 --> 39:00.900
and that's it. Join us next week

39:00.967 --> 39:04.333
when we see who else can trick
the magnificent Penn and Teller.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.033
-See you then.
