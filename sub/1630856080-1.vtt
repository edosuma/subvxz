D.C., what's going on?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.017
Oh my God.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.519
Thank you.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.897
Thank you. Sit down, sit down,
get comfortable, my God.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.691
Thank you so much.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.234
Oh!

01:13.281 --> 01:14.157
Thank you.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.951
Thank you so much, man.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.577
Washington, D.C.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.204
We're doing Netflix, baby.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.249
We're doin' it. We're doin' it. Oh!

01:26.961 --> 01:29.547
This is so cool, man. I wish...

01:29.631 --> 01:31.632
I wish my grandpa could see this.

01:31.716 --> 01:35.052
He, um... I... I... I always wanted
to bring him here to visit.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.763
You know, he knew how much I loved D.C.,
and he... he...

01:37.847 --> 01:41.600
he loved Maryland.
It was like his favorite state, which...

01:41.684 --> 01:43.352
Well, wh--

01:43.436 --> 01:45.688
Well, which, you know,
is... is a valid response

01:45.772 --> 01:49.275
unless you've been to Baltimore,
because it too...

01:49.359 --> 01:52.153
What the fuck is going on
in Baltimore, dude?

01:52.237 --> 01:56.699
Mar-- Bro, Maryland as a state
cannot pick a tone, dawg.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.034
Just pick one--

01:58.118 --> 02:00.953
It's so beautiful
and so ratchet for no reason.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.623
Can y'all just pick a tone, man?

02:04.707 --> 02:07.668
All of Maryland. Y'all drive
to the beach with your top down

02:07.752 --> 02:10.171
and then go to Baltimore
and lock all your doors.

02:10.255 --> 02:15.176
You know, no middle ground ever, man.
I've only been to Baltimore one time.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.512
I ate lunch there, and the hostess,
who seats you at the restaurant,

02:18.596 --> 02:19.764
had a black eye.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.976
A full black--
It wasn't like, "What happened?"

02:24.060 --> 02:26.103
I... It was pretty obvious what happened.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.982
We couldn't get over the fact,
"This is the face of the company?"

02:30.066 --> 02:32.818
Like, "This is... This is
who you have greeting people?"

02:32.902 --> 02:36.113
And my boy, who I was with
was like, "Yeah, I feel bad for her."

02:36.197 --> 02:39.950
"I feel like they should, you know,
put her in the kitchen or something...

02:40.034 --> 02:42.328
where nobody has to see
her face, you know."

02:42.412 --> 02:45.456
And I was like, "Yeah, but I feel like
if she could cook, she wouldn't

02:45.540 --> 02:47.291
have that black eye."

02:47.375 --> 02:49.543
So...

02:51.212 --> 02:54.131
Testing the water,
seeing if y'all are gonna be fun or not.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.050
Just wanted to see.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.469
Just wanted to see.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.763
I figure if we start
with domestic violence,

03:00.847 --> 03:02.557
the rest of the show should be...

03:03.349 --> 03:05.643
should be pretty smooth
sailing after that.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.479
Yeah, of course, I felt bad for her, man.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.857
She should've had her protection crystals,
you know what I mean?

03:13.568 --> 03:15.653
Fellas, we gotta put our foot down, man.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.281
This crystal shit is getting
out of control.

03:19.032 --> 03:23.161
Ladies,
put the fuckin' pebbles down, okay?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.914
We are sick and tired of walking
into your bedroom

03:26.998 --> 03:29.792
looking like we gotta beat you
in a game of mancala

03:29.876 --> 03:31.585
before we can sleep with you.

03:31.669 --> 03:34.923
What the fuck is
all this gravel doing inside, Thanos?

03:36.716 --> 03:39.135
I swear, the biggest issue
with crystal girls

03:39.219 --> 03:41.345
is the fact it's their entire personality,

03:41.429 --> 03:43.473
and they won't shut up about it.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.143
I mean, you even, God forbid,
bring it up mid-conversation.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.394
Aw!

03:48.478 --> 03:51.814
This is my favorite one.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.482
This is, um...

03:53.566 --> 03:56.861
This is a piece of green Peruvian jade,

03:56.945 --> 04:00.698
and it provides me with, like, strength

04:00.782 --> 04:03.450
and... and... and protection

04:03.534 --> 04:05.828
and... and... and...

04:05.912 --> 04:07.037
and no, it doesn't.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.249
No, it's not, okay.

04:10.333 --> 04:14.379
That's a broken shard
of a Heineken bottle that you...

04:15.421 --> 04:18.633
...that you bought
from a white dude with dreadlocks,

04:19.968 --> 04:22.761
who also runs a throat goat yoga class.

04:22.845 --> 04:23.680
Okay?

04:24.180 --> 04:27.308
Say what it really is, some bullshit.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.270
The only thing it's protecting is me

04:31.062 --> 04:35.107
from dating another girl
who's pussy tastes like kombucha.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.025
Okay?

04:36.109 --> 04:39.445
No more hippie shit.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.322
Shower.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.286
Maybe get back to using real deodorant?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.496
No more of this organic deodorant shit

04:49.580 --> 04:52.082
that lasts shorter
than fuckin' fruit-stripe gum.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.543
Okay? No more.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.753
Y'all remember that garbage?

04:55.837 --> 04:58.255
- Yeah!
- It would last two chews.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.591
That's y'all walking around, two smacks,

05:00.675 --> 05:02.385
stinkin' all over again, dude.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.638
I'm so sick of it, man.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.641
This hippie shit is gonna be
the death of me, I swear.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.270
If I hear one more person blame
how their life is going on Mercury,

05:14.605 --> 05:16.733
I will kill you myself. Do you understand?

05:17.233 --> 05:20.361
You leave that goddamn planet alone.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.950
I'm so tired of you ladies blaming
your poor decision-making skills

05:26.701 --> 05:30.412
on planets that don't even know you.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.249
Get this through your head.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.627
Astrology is not
this magical life guideline

05:36.711 --> 05:39.505
that... that predetermines
your future in the stars.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.756
No, none of that.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.801
Your future is depended
by your thoughts, opinions, and actions.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.679
You are in complete control of
how your future turns out.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.848
It's not up here. It's in here
the whole time. It's up to you.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.435
It has nothing to do with the stars, man.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.855
Just because Jupiter has a ring,
and you don't, doesn't mean...

06:00.193 --> 06:02.403
...that's who you're supposed to look up to

06:02.487 --> 06:04.530
for all this magical advice, man.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.366
And stop trying
to explain it so confidently,

06:07.450 --> 06:09.202
you look stupid every time.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.664
It's so-- The girl of your dreams
will look you straight in the eyes

06:13.748 --> 06:14.957
and say some dumb shit,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.710
like, "Would you even know
how the universe works?"

06:17.794 --> 06:20.213
No, but tell me, Professor.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.883
"There's a planet called Mercury.
When it slows its rotation around the sun,

06:24.967 --> 06:26.885
it causes retrograde 98 million miles away

06:26.969 --> 06:29.847
and that's why my life
is just in absolute shambles."

06:29.931 --> 06:33.267
"Like it's literally not even up to me."

06:33.351 --> 06:34.185
"Like,

06:34.811 --> 06:38.564
it's in the stars and...
...like, we're literally all stardust."

06:38.648 --> 06:39.816
"You know what I mean?"

06:41.401 --> 06:42.860
Yeah, you're gonna die alone.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.948
'Cause you can't take responsibility
for your own actions.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.869
Your life isn't in shambles
because of a planet in the sky.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.790
It's because you can't live
without a vape in your mouth.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.668
And you only fuck guys
who need to borrow your car.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.627
Okay?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.589
Yeah.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.508
That's why your life is in shambles.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.012
You're worried about Mercury
while he crashing your Saturn.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.347
How stupid do you feel?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.854
Wrong planet, bitch. Guess again.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.898
Yeah, it's gonna kill me, man.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.609
I feel it's
a younger generational thing too, right?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.695
The crystals and astrology and all that.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.655
Which makes sense.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.867
I fuckin' hate young people, dude.
I really do. Ah!

07:33.244 --> 07:37.456
Anybody... anybody my age or younger,
you don't have anything to offer me, man.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.291
I just-- I-- You're so rude!

07:39.375 --> 07:42.795
Young people are so disrespectful
even when they're not trying to be.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.299
Like, five months ago, I got a tattoo
of John Lennon on the back of my arm,

07:47.383 --> 07:50.969
and it's... it's pretty fuckin' obviously
John Lennon.

07:51.053 --> 07:55.307
Like, it's... it's a good tattoo. As soon as
I post it on Instagram, everybody was,

07:55.391 --> 07:57.309
"He's a Harry Potter fan?"

07:57.393 --> 08:00.855
I was like, fuck these kids, dude.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.067
That is so disrespectful to one
of the greatest musicians of all time.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.903
Like, John Lennon got
fuckin' <i>Avada Kedavra</i> on his back,

08:07.987 --> 08:09.697
and that's why he's not here. No.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.658
Same glasses,
but he's the boy who didn't live.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.371
I know, and if that made you sad,
you're my audience.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.665
Good. I like you a lot. Good.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.459
It also breaks my heart. That's good.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.337
God, I hate young people.
And there's no middle ground.

08:25.421 --> 08:30.134
I hate young people, and I...
...I fuckin' love

08:31.052 --> 08:32.469
old people.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.598
Oh my God.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.435
It is... it is really
an unhealthy obsession.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.564
It is. Oh, bro,
I would fuck a grandma in a heartbeat.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.732
I really would do it.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.108
I'd do it.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.653
You can.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.322
I don't know if you've done research.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.367
You can fuck as many as you want,
and there's no law against it.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.995
As many as you want. As many as you want.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.372
You just gotta be gentle about it.
You can't...

09:00.456 --> 09:03.292
You can't choke 'em.
You gotta, like, kink their oxygen.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.043
Know what I mean?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.088
Aah, not today. not today.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.841
You're all right. You're fine.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.635
Walker it off.

09:15.471 --> 09:19.057
Fuck being somebody's first.
But somebody's last? That's a flex.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.809
Oh, my goodness.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.727
That's...

09:22.645 --> 09:25.690
That's where I thrive, baby.
I'm out here cleanin' it up.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.942
They call me the Trim Reaper, dawg.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.738
I'm just out here snatchin' souls,
you know what I mean?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.994
Oh, dude, I do... I love old people so much.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.830
Like, the more an old person
is shaped like a candy cane.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.211
Dude.
I love a motherfucker who just...

09:47.295 --> 09:49.838
Argh!

09:49.922 --> 09:51.882
He just can't even look up.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.761
Even he doesn't know
how much life is ahead of him.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.221
You know what I mean? Just...

09:57.763 --> 10:01.601
That's the weight of a good life lived,
fuckin' up his back, man. Ugh...

10:02.310 --> 10:04.520
You old persons
gotta have bad posture, man.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.939
That tells you lived
your life to the fullest.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.234
If you meet one with good posture,
they dodged the draft 100%.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.027
You don't have my respect. Sorry.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.487
Oh, man.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.989
They gotta have bad pos.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.659
The worst an old person's posture,
the better the stories.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.539
"How'd you get like that?" Used to be
my favorite part about visiting

10:23.623 --> 10:26.250
my great-grandmother
at the hospice center she was at

10:26.334 --> 10:29.044
for her remaining years
when I was a teenager.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.005
She's where they take care of you
for your remaining time,

10:32.089 --> 10:35.050
and my mom would drop us off
for like three or four hours,

10:35.134 --> 10:37.761
which is great.
I wanna spend time with my grandma,

10:37.845 --> 10:39.680
but my grandma also had dementia,

10:39.764 --> 10:44.142
so, 25 minutes in, I could be like,
"I'm gonna get some more water,"

10:44.226 --> 10:46.812
and she'd be,
"There's a lot of Blacks." I'm like...

10:48.606 --> 10:50.733
- The--
- There's more for sure, um...

10:51.901 --> 10:54.152
I could excuse myself
and go do my own thing.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.780
It's not that I didn't love her
or didn't wanna hang out.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.950
People with dementia can't remember,
so there's not a lot to talk about.

11:00.034 --> 11:04.079
And it just so happened the guy,
Lenny, in the room right next to her

11:04.163 --> 11:05.498
remembered everything.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.750
This guy was
the coolest person I had ever met.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.587
He was 97 and had
the coolest life I ever heard of.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.882
He'd tell me story after story
after story for hours and hours on end,

11:15.966 --> 11:17.301
and they were captivating.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.097
He lived a very full life.
He fought in three wars in his lifetime.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.348
He climbed five mountains.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.809
He, um...

11:25.309 --> 11:28.770
Yeah, he... he told me he fucked Rosa Parks.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.151
I know, in the front of the bus.
and I was like...

11:36.737 --> 11:38.823
I think you have dementia. I don't think...

11:39.532 --> 11:41.825
that happened the way you remembered it.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.202
Wouldn't the back of the bus
be more private?

11:44.286 --> 11:47.456
I feel like you could put in
some work back there, but well,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
that's the cons of being young, I guess.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.962
You can't fact-check
an old person's story. I wasn't there.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.089
I hate being young.
I don't know nothin'. I'm 28.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.800
I don't know for sure
that Michael Jackson was Black.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.180
Y'all keep saying it. I didn't see it.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.476
And every photo I've seen,
he was an Asian woman, so I--

12:10.146 --> 12:11.105
I'll never know.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.857
It frustrates me to no end, man.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.275
I love old people, dude.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.736
I wish my entire audience was
like 65 and up.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.779
Oh my God.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.657
Yeah. It'd be a much shorter career, but...

12:23.701 --> 12:25.994
They take into consideration
who they've seen.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.621
I'm kinda flattered, you know.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.624
What I love about old stories,

12:30.708 --> 12:33.168
like hearing Lenny's stories
for hours on end

12:33.252 --> 12:36.630
is it inspires me to think
about the stories I'm gonna have to tell

12:36.714 --> 12:37.881
when I get to that age.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.926
I hope I live a full life
and have fun stories to pass down.

12:41.010 --> 12:45.138
I liked hearing about his war stories,
his adventures, his family stories.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.766
That excited me the most,
to have a family someday.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.727
I'm excited to have kids, but not now.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.188
No, not now.
Things are going very well, um...

12:55.024 --> 12:58.903
I'm also terrified to have kids, man,
'cause I've made fun of a lot of people.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.031
And if you believe in karma...

13:05.910 --> 13:09.413
My kid is about to be fucked up, dude.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.876
My kid is about to have five legs
and a shark fin on his back.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.504
He is about to be a monstrosity.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.966
And I know I'm not mature enough
to have that conversation

13:21.050 --> 13:24.053
when he's finally, like,
"Why am I like this?"

13:25.888 --> 13:27.389
Fuck!

13:28.599 --> 13:29.766
I'm just there, like...

13:30.768 --> 13:32.644
Ugh!

13:32.728 --> 13:35.647
'Cause Daddy's funny.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.357
You know.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.568
I've made a lot of people laugh.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.737
So will you.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.201
For different reasons, but you know.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.620
If they pay the admission.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.167
I think it's mainly about timing for me.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.795
I wanna pick the right time
to have kids 'cause I... I'm 28,

13:58.879 --> 14:01.840
so realistically,
I have all the time in the world, but...

14:01.924 --> 14:03.550
The benefits of being a guy,

14:03.634 --> 14:05.886
we don't have to rush
into starting a family.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.556
We can have kids whenever we want,
which I don't think is fair to women,

14:09.640 --> 14:13.227
considering women are the ones
who literally have to have the baby.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.647
Doesn't make sense you'd have
to compete against this biological clock.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.732
It seems messed up.

14:19.316 --> 14:23.153
'Cause for... for women, you can wait
till you're older, but the older you get,

14:23.237 --> 14:26.073
don't the odds start to go up
of your kid being...

14:30.244 --> 14:32.287
"...first to lunch," we'll call it.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.250
Is there a nicer way to say it?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.835
You can groan all you want,

14:38.919 --> 14:42.005
but don't act like 25 minutes
before you were allowed to go,

14:42.089 --> 14:45.467
you didn't have to watch them
hauling ass down the hallway.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.304
You were just like...

14:49.221 --> 14:50.055
Argh!

14:50.723 --> 14:51.849
Goddammit.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.977
Naruto is gonna drink up
all the spaghetti.

14:56.061 --> 14:56.895
Great.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.614
Not to say it's a bad thing.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.869
I... I-- In fact, I actually think
it's kinda cool to see the way God works.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.997
If you pay attention, God always finds
a way of evening things out.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.500
God always replaces
a negative with a positive.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.045
Anytime you see somebody
who is born... less fortunate

15:22.129 --> 15:26.132
in a certain aspect, you don't gotta worry
'cause God's gonna bless them

15:26.216 --> 15:29.511
with... with an attribute,
a... a quality about themselves,

15:29.595 --> 15:31.221
sometimes even a skill set.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.348
Kinda evens that playin' field a little.

15:33.432 --> 15:38.144
I noticed it first in my nephew, Chase.
He's a teenager now, but he's autistic

15:38.228 --> 15:39.063
as fuck,

15:39.772 --> 15:43.567
wh-- which is probably not
the medical term, but he, um... he...

15:44.151 --> 15:46.278
he got it, for sure. Um...

15:46.946 --> 15:49.865
He's, uh... he's... he's nonverbal.
That's his thing.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.701
Unless you're his mom,
he won't speak to you,

15:52.785 --> 15:54.995
no eye contact,
won't acknowledge you're in the room.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.830
It's pretty rude, but that's...

15:58.332 --> 15:59.875
...that's his symptom, you know.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.335
But get this. His blessing...

16:01.835 --> 16:03.837
His blessing is that he can paint.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.966
As a teenager, he paints better
than any art teacher I've ever had.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.011
I just think it's cool to see
the way God always finds a way

16:11.095 --> 16:12.429
of evenin' things out.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.222
It's really impressive to me, and...

16:16.225 --> 16:18.184
I wish I would've known
to look for that sooner.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.478
It might've changed my perspective
on things growing up.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.731
There was a kid, Alex, in our high school.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.026
Alex was the same age as me.
We entered high school together.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.527
Had gym class together.

16:27.611 --> 16:31.407
He... he was special needs,
and he... he had a...

16:34.660 --> 16:38.705
he... he had a...
... <i>dick</i> on him, man.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.956
I don't know...

16:40.040 --> 16:44.169
I don't know how else to tell y'all that.
That boy was... ... <i>blessed</i> , man.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.505
People felt sorry for him.
"Fuck that, dude."

16:47.589 --> 16:50.425
"He's been terrorizing us
in the locker room the whole semester."

16:51.593 --> 16:55.639
Got us all backed up against the lockers.
It's like, "Goddamn, Alex!"

16:56.598 --> 16:59.225
That's where the extra chromosome goes?

17:01.478 --> 17:03.438
Good for you, man.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.024
Until this day,
he's the nicest person I've met.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.694
I hope he's out there
hurting somebody now. Really.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.238
She needs the helmet.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.575
You know, they don't always...
They don't always know their own strength.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.745
But he's a good dude.
He deserves every inch of it and...

17:20.664 --> 17:23.959
Yeah, we used to say
he had dick-you-down syndrome.

17:24.043 --> 17:24.876
Yeah.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.798
Big shout-out to Alex, man.
Big shout-out to Alex.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.675
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.888
Short bus, but a long dick, man.
And that's...

17:36.847 --> 17:40.058
That's balance. It's what life's all about
at the end of the day.

17:40.142 --> 17:40.976
Balance.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.020
You can't have everything.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.273
Sometimes, you just funny.

17:48.859 --> 17:49.777
Whoo!

17:59.453 --> 18:00.287
It's fine.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.791
I still fucked him up in dodgeball.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.588
Out of pure jealousy.
I was like, "You're not even using it."

18:15.385 --> 18:17.346
Yeah, but...

18:18.305 --> 18:20.015
God works in mysterious ways, huh?

18:22.267 --> 18:26.062
Know what's funny? I've mentioned God
eight times the past two minutes.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.732
I'm really not the most religious person.
I'm really not.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.152
I hope there's a god.
I pray every day that there's a god.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.822
It'd make a lot of sense,
answer a lot of questions.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.448
It's tricky sometimes.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.785
Certain things'll happen,
make you question faith a little bit.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.079
It's hard to pick a religion, man.

18:42.663 --> 18:48.084
It's-- I say it's hard to pick a religion,
but I... I... I do still wear a cross chain.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.711
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.299
But for the same reason you bring
a condom on the first date. You know.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.928
I hope I don't gotta use it, but you know.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.305
Just in case.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.809
In case I die, and Jesus is like,
"You ain't gettin' in here."

19:04.893 --> 19:07.187
"Nah, son, I bought the wristband."

19:09.523 --> 19:12.693
Let me in.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.488
I paid for this meet-and-greet.
Where your dad at?

19:25.038 --> 19:27.332
Yeah, religion is... is just tricky, man.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.335
But I've always respected it.
Always respected religion.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.421
Everybody's religion's good.
I have the utmost respect for.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.257
It's important for people
to have something to believe in.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.468
My ex tried to drive it home pretty heavy.

19:38.552 --> 19:42.764
She was super religious. My ex is one
of the most religious people I've met,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.307
which is hilarious

19:44.391 --> 19:46.643
'cause she is not getting
into heaven, bro.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.479
Not... not a fuckin' chance, man.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.939
Not even as my plus-one.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.774
She's gonna have to chill

19:52.858 --> 19:55.736
for a couple centuries
outside these gates, man.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.071
She was so religious,

19:58.155 --> 20:01.282
but just...
...not a good person.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.284
Like, do you know people like that?

20:03.368 --> 20:04.285
Whoo!

20:04.369 --> 20:08.999
They're so religious that you're like,
"You're compensating a little bit."

20:10.250 --> 20:12.752
What kind of Christian wakes up
to read the Bible every morning

20:12.836 --> 20:16.506
when last night, all you wanted me to do
was lick your butt. Like, wha--

20:18.091 --> 20:20.426
What psalm is that, Jezebel?

20:22.763 --> 20:25.891
And how'd you get me to do it?
That's the bigger question.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.018
Dude, that's fuckin' disgusting, man.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.937
You don't understand.
I don't even eat onions.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.357
I never thought I'd do nothing like that.
I don't know what came over me.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.776
I don't know if it was
the butt Holy Spirit or what,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.278
but that shit just

20:39.154 --> 20:42.282
had your boy speaking in tongues.
You know what I mean? Just...

20:46.870 --> 20:47.955
Still broke up.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.000
Did you ever eat someone's ass,
then break up.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.171
It's the worst Last Supper ever, dude.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.297
It's just...

21:00.842 --> 21:01.843
It's disgusting.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.014
Tastes like betrayal and pennies.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.354
But...

21:13.438 --> 21:14.940
...it's her religion, you know.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.402
I don't, you know,
discredit anybody's beliefs.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.820
I believe in things.

21:20.904 --> 21:24.282
I do have beliefs. They might not be
as deep-rooted as religion,

21:24.366 --> 21:27.368
but I do believe in things that affect
my life to a severe degree.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.330
Um, for example,
I'm... I'm a terrible sleeper.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.916
I... I have terrible,
terrible sleep problems,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.961
and part of that is to do with the fact
that one of my biggest beliefs

21:37.045 --> 21:39.214
is in ghosts and monsters.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.719
I'm a 28-year-old grown man,
and my biggest fear is the dark.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.471
You don't know what's in there.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.348
I'll tell you, ghosts and monsters,

21:48.432 --> 21:51.309
and y'all look ridiculous
for not being more concerned about it

21:51.393 --> 21:52.811
on a day-to-day basis, dude.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.646
They're so real.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.773
I'm such a bitch, man. I really am.

21:56.857 --> 21:57.774
I--

21:57.858 --> 22:00.944
I literally have to sleep
with my TV on every single night

22:01.486 --> 22:05.114
'cause I've really convinced myself
that if the TV's on,

22:05.198 --> 22:09.452
the ghosts are gonna think
I have people over,

22:09.536 --> 22:13.790
so... I'll just be like chiming in
to shit that I'm watchin',

22:13.874 --> 22:15.083
just doin' too much.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.044
Just... Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.631
That's crazy how much fun
we're all having in here.

22:23.216 --> 22:27.136
Just me and 12 of the biggest Black dudes
you've ever seen.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.182
Hanging out watching <i>Mean Girls</i> .

22:31.266 --> 22:34.894
You know, you gotta...
...lay down some ground rules.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.313
Gotta let these ghosts know
they're not safe in your house.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.524
You squatted up in there. They don't know.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.235
Twelve Black dudes
ain't afraid of nothin'.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.862
Except for people dressed like ghosts.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.493
Yeah.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.746
I told you all monsters are real.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.794
I just... I... I do not
mess with ghosts, man.

22:59.628 --> 23:03.089
You can't even confront 'em
'cause the ironic thing about ghosts

23:03.173 --> 23:07.219
is the more innocent and approachable
a ghost should be, the scarier it is.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.514
The ghost of a child.
Get the fuck away from me.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.058
I don't know if you're a demon

23:14.142 --> 23:17.186
or an Amber Alert,
but I want you outta my house right now.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.773
Those are always the scariest ones,
just showin' up in your hallways.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.942
Come play with us.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.028
They're always British.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.281
All dead kids are British
when they're a ghost for no reason.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.951
Little dead British kids
always wanna play.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.497
I don't even know
what an American kid ghost would say,

23:36.373 --> 23:38.041
but that'd be terrifying to hear.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.127
Can you imagine crawling
into bed at 3:00 a.m. and hear,

23:41.211 --> 23:42.962
"I hate this school."

23:56.810 --> 23:58.561
Just seeing if y'all are still fun.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.813
Just wanted to see. Just wanted to see.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.940
Just checkin' in.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.026
Ah, dude.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.154
Ghosts are terrifying, man.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.282
The only thing that scares me
more than ghosts is monsters,

24:11.366 --> 24:14.119
and I'm... I'm pretty sick of y'all
not taking 'em serious.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.413
'Cause they're all over the place, man.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.957
That's the thing about monsters.
Nobody knows where they're at.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.543
Everybody has theories
as to where they think they hide.

24:22.627 --> 24:26.339
I've... I've heard weird places.
I've heard, like, closed shower curtain.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.510
I know people who won't use a restroom
unless they open the shower curtain first

24:30.594 --> 24:34.430
to make sure this motherfucker isn't
in there lathering up with the 3-in-1.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.767
It turns out he's the one takin'
fistfuls of hair against the shower walls

24:37.851 --> 24:38.935
for all those years.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.854
Mmm.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.773
A little skeptical about that one.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.567
Some places make more sense than others.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.945
The closet is a big one.
It's pretty standard.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.988
Plenty of people are afraid
of a monster comin' out

24:51.072 --> 24:53.325
in the middle of the night
just eatin' you up.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.494
That checks out.
That's fuckin' terrifyin'.

24:56.578 --> 25:00.081
You can't have a monster comin'
outta the closet. That's scary twice.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.049
You're tellin' me
not only is there a monster in my room

25:09.549 --> 25:12.219
but maybe he's gay?

25:13.011 --> 25:17.223
You said he was gonna eat me up.

25:17.307 --> 25:20.435
You didn't say dick first.
You left out so many details.

25:22.604 --> 25:26.274
Now, I've just got this gay darkness
roaming around my bedroom?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.734
I'm being haunted by Lil Nas X?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.611
You let me know. You let me know.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.410
I wanna know if the next song's about me.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.620
Mm-hmm, yeah.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.290
Like, why'd he choose my closet,
ya know? Like, it's...

25:43.250 --> 25:46.169
That's less scary more flattering.
I can get on board with that.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.505
The closet makes sense.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.508
I will say probably the number one spot
that's most common

25:52.592 --> 25:55.845
that I was never really afraid
of a monster hiding there

25:55.929 --> 25:57.222
was under the bed.

25:58.014 --> 26:01.476
It's one of the more common places,
especially when you're a kid.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.105
You'd be afraid of a monster's hand
comin' up and grabbin' your leg.

26:06.022 --> 26:06.982
Never scared me.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.485
I think because I started
masturbating pretty early.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.573
So by 11 or 12, I was like, "Hey, huh,

26:15.532 --> 26:17.450
if a hand reach up here."

26:19.869 --> 26:21.913
He's just helpin'. You know what I mean?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.832
I'm the monster now.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.668
You know, bro.
He ain't even built for that, bro.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.713
I would dick my bed demon down, dude.

26:30.797 --> 26:34.008
He's not built for those rounds.
He'd be catchin' feelin's,

26:34.092 --> 26:35.510
getting possessive and shit.

26:36.094 --> 26:39.764
He's knockin' on my headboard at 3:00 a.m.
He's like, "You up?"

26:39.848 --> 26:40.682
What?

26:41.308 --> 26:44.101
I got school in the morning, dawg.
Chill out. Chill.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.020
Goddamn.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.688
You're not full? Huh?

26:52.819 --> 26:55.030
I didn't think
he could fit under there, man.

26:55.739 --> 26:59.534
There's no way there's room for a monster
<i>and</i> all those towels under my bed.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.035
You know what I mean?

27:01.119 --> 27:03.454
And if there is one, he is crunchy.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.414
He ain't...

27:04.914 --> 27:07.583
He ain't sneakin' up on nobody.
It's way too loud.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.090
You can hear a semen demon
coming from a mile away.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.383
You really can, right?

27:16.509 --> 27:18.178
They ain't got no stealth at all.

27:20.055 --> 27:20.972
It's a damn shame.

27:26.144 --> 27:26.978
However,

27:28.396 --> 27:30.482
piggybacking off of semen demons...

27:31.024 --> 27:32.358
The--

27:32.442 --> 27:36.404
There is another monster people
are pretty afraid of we should talk about.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.655
Clowns.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.533
A lot of people don't fuck with clowns.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.703
Even though you've dated a few.
That's on you. Still...

27:44.204 --> 27:46.038
Still a respectable fear, I get it.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.749
I... I'm not personally afraid of clowns,
but I get it.

27:48.833 --> 27:52.044
I've... I've got four sisters,
and they're terrified of clowns.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.213
'Cause when I was about 13 years old,

27:54.297 --> 27:57.384
we all watched the, uh,
the original <i>It</i> movies.

27:58.259 --> 28:01.512
For anybody who has no idea,
there's a movie called <i>It</i> .

28:01.596 --> 28:03.598
It's... it's based on a Stephen King book.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.810
It's about
this killer-demon-monster clown,

28:07.894 --> 28:11.188
who lives in the sewer system,
and he comes up through the drains

28:11.272 --> 28:14.483
to, like, eat children.
That's the whole movie, him as a monster.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.694
We watched this movie
at my grandpa's house,

28:16.778 --> 28:19.572
and it scared my sisters so bad,

28:20.240 --> 28:23.076
they didn't shower for three weeks.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.038
That... that's how terrified they were,
that he was gonna come up

28:27.122 --> 28:29.832
through the drains
and eat them when they were kids.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.918
But they didn't know that by that time...

28:33.670 --> 28:35.921
I had been jerking off in the shower.

28:36.005 --> 28:36.840
So like,

28:37.340 --> 28:39.800
he been eating my children. I figured...

28:41.052 --> 28:44.472
I figure we built a good rapport
and understanding, you know?

28:44.556 --> 28:47.558
You're not gonna kill the cow
when you get the milk for free.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.686
That's just...
That's bad Business 101. You know?

28:50.770 --> 28:53.272
His name is Pennywise,
but he be eating quarter-loads.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.483
I'll tell ya that much right now.
That boy...

28:56.276 --> 28:58.862
That boy eatin' good down there, man.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.282
And they all float. Don't they?
Right on top of the water.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.325
Like an oil spill.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.871
You shouldn't be jerking off
in the shower.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.956
That's how you get early onset Candy Cane

29:11.040 --> 29:13.460
'cause you're just hunched over
in that hot water.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.838
You're getting molded like a mouthpiece.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.882
It's also a waste of your time

29:19.966 --> 29:23.177
'cause if you miss the drain directly,
and it gets somewhere on the tub,

29:23.261 --> 29:26.806
you gotta spend the next 12 minutes
just gathering water, like...

29:35.482 --> 29:38.735
It's gotta be a direct hit,
or it does no damage at all. And I'm--

29:39.402 --> 29:43.198
I'm realizing right now,
I need more guy fans. That'd help a lot.

29:44.073 --> 29:47.910
If this room was 70% dudes the way it is
women, this joke would have been like...

29:47.994 --> 29:50.538
Ahh!

29:50.622 --> 29:52.039
'Cause all the dudes get it

29:52.123 --> 29:54.375
and every girl is like,
"Is it a jellyfish?"

29:54.459 --> 29:55.293
Like, what?

29:55.919 --> 29:57.420
Why... why would it stick--

29:57.504 --> 30:00.507
Kind of, consistency-wise,
it's not far off from a jellyfish.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.676
It's disgusting, whatever it is, man.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.429
Guys are so gross.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.058
Luckily, we're funny on accident.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.770
I think that's what helps us get through
the embarrassment of puberty

30:14.854 --> 30:16.772
'cause you ladies would lose your mind

30:16.856 --> 30:19.108
if you really saw
how much of a shitshow it is

30:19.192 --> 30:23.071
to be a young man trying to learn
how to masturbate proficiently.

30:23.988 --> 30:24.822
Ah, dude.

30:24.906 --> 30:28.117
It's just embarrassing mistake
after embarrassing mistake.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.954
I... I mean, I suppose nobody understands
the difficulty more than women

30:32.038 --> 30:35.499
'cause how y'all figure out
your own little fidget spinner on your own

30:35.583 --> 30:38.669
I'll never understand in a million years.

30:38.753 --> 30:42.381
Y'all are just thrown to the wilderness
with no owner's manual or nothing.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.134
Just forced to figure it out for yourself.
And you do!

30:45.218 --> 30:48.012
All by yourself, and I'm so proud
of each and every one of you.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.013
I really am.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.431
'Cause...

30:55.395 --> 30:58.022
'Cause if you didn't,
we never would, literally ever.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.443
You already have to walk us through
every step of the way,

31:02.527 --> 31:05.363
and even that's exhausting
in the simplest form.

31:06.906 --> 31:07.740
Fellas.

31:08.408 --> 31:13.663
How many times
have you fingered a girl for so long

31:14.664 --> 31:16.499
you wake up the next day, like...

31:17.458 --> 31:20.920
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

31:21.004 --> 31:23.673
Did I go fuckin' bowling last night?

31:25.133 --> 31:28.803
Did I indoor rock climb for nine hours?

31:29.596 --> 31:32.681
I'm walking around the next day
pointing at shit like Spider-Man

31:32.765 --> 31:33.683
'cause I can't...

31:34.350 --> 31:36.686
I can't straighten my tendons anymore.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.480
I can't grip shit the next day.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.608
It's like great. Yeah, you came,
and I got cerebral palsy.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.152
Awesome. Yeah, that.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.783
It hurts, man.
You ladies are very strong. Good job.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.080
Women definitely have it harder.
There's no argument there.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.749
I think men just have it
more embarrassing,

31:58.833 --> 32:01.585
'cause we don't...
we don't take anybody's advice.

32:01.669 --> 32:05.297
We only learn via trial and error,
and you don't forget those errors.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.342
Every man in this room has been caught...

32:08.760 --> 32:10.135
whether you know it or not.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.432
You're not as sneaky as you think you are.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.726
And-- That's good,
you have to figure out your system.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.062
As an adult man,
every guy in this room knows

32:20.146 --> 32:22.106
how to do it,
where to do it, when to do it.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.775
How to adjust according
to time zones and solstices.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.736
There's a whole...
There's a whole rigmarole that goes on,

32:27.820 --> 32:29.864
but we have to figure that out
the hard way.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.784
And thank God I never got caught,
like, in the act.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.619
I don't know how I would've recovered,

32:35.703 --> 32:39.207
but I do remember getting caught
with porn for the first time,

32:40.249 --> 32:41.960
and I was, uh, oh, boy...

32:42.669 --> 32:44.963
I... I was 12 years old.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.716
Yeah. In my defense,
I wasn't looking for porn when I found it.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.761
I was looking for Christmas presents
in my parents' bedroom.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.222
It was middle of December.
When I get home from school,

32:55.306 --> 32:58.893
there was always a couple-hour window
before my mom would get home from work.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.646
I knew they'd been Christmas shopping,
so I broke into their room.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.691
I was snoopin' around.
First place I checked was under the bed.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.026
My bed monster was there.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.612
"Oh, you looking for another bitch?"
I was like...

33:10.530 --> 33:13.533
"Not now, a different mission. Okay?" Um...

33:14.867 --> 33:15.868
Um...

33:16.786 --> 33:17.620
Closet.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.831
That's where you keep the goods, right?

33:20.915 --> 33:23.208
So I go over to the closet confidently.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.086
Wing it open.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.257
Nothin'.

33:31.217 --> 33:34.929
So I was about to just give up and go back
to my room, and I heard a voice.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.349
I don't know if it came from in my head
or under the bed, but it said,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.727
"Check the top shelf."

33:46.858 --> 33:48.151
So I did.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.989
And at first glance, it was
a typical top shelf of a parents' closet.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.784
Blankets folded up at the front,
some hoodies to the side,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.870
but what caught my eye
was a piece of blue cardboard

33:59.954 --> 34:01.664
sticking up from behind the blankets,

34:01.748 --> 34:04.417
so I brought the blankets down,
and it revealed this...

34:05.168 --> 34:06.252
this gigantic

34:07.003 --> 34:08.796
Bud Light beer box.

34:09.756 --> 34:13.217
One of the huge cases,
like the 64-can count of Bud Light.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.720
You have stepdads?
You know what I'm talking about.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.932
Yeah, "That this ain't my real family"
case of beer.

34:21.851 --> 34:25.688
But I knew, even at 12 I knew. I was like,
"That's not where beer goes."

34:26.606 --> 34:28.774
"I betcha there's presents in there."

34:28.858 --> 34:30.234
And boy was there.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.946
Bro, I brought this box down.

34:34.030 --> 34:37.366
It was the biggest box
of porn anyone has ever seen.

34:38.076 --> 34:43.122
It was a whole box filled with,
like, 40 VHS tapes

34:43.831 --> 34:48.168
that my stepdad had accumulated
over his "career," I guess.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.503
And I'm...

34:49.587 --> 34:53.507
I'm just siftin' through 'em.
They're labeled different, weird things.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.010
One of them was, like, April 2003,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.638
which was terrifying
'cause that's my mom's name.

35:00.681 --> 35:03.267
I was like, "June, July,
August better be in here somewhere."

35:03.351 --> 35:04.477
Like this better be...

35:05.436 --> 35:08.397
This better be a time stamp
and not therapy forever.

35:08.481 --> 35:12.109
Um... Couldn't risk it,
chose a blank one off the top,

35:12.193 --> 35:14.486
put the box and blankets back
exactly the way I found them,

35:14.570 --> 35:15.612
ran to my room with it.

35:15.696 --> 35:18.074
I had a VHS player in my room,
and I watched it.

35:18.741 --> 35:19.575
A lot.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.537
That first one was for me. Treat yourself.

35:23.621 --> 35:27.750
Yeah. But after that first time,
I was really in there taking down notes.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.128
'Cause not a lot of women
really know how important

35:31.212 --> 35:33.672
porn is to the learning process
of a young man.

35:33.756 --> 35:37.843
'Cause before we see porn,
we don't know anything,

35:37.927 --> 35:39.595
and we really pretend like we do,

35:39.679 --> 35:43.015
so this is a bombshell
of new information to try to absorb.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.185
It's very confusing.
When you're that young and inexperienced,

35:46.769 --> 35:49.021
you have no idea that porn

35:49.689 --> 35:51.274
is not real sex.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.235
At that age, you can't even fathom
that those are two different things.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.653
After I watched this one movie,

35:56.737 --> 35:59.406
I thought you could only have sex
with five other people.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.328
I thought all sex was gang bangs.
I was like, "Huh?"

36:04.412 --> 36:06.580
I need more and better friends.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.500
Not Alex.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.174
It's also a lot
of positive information we do need

36:17.258 --> 36:20.052
'cause we're so stupid
and so confident at that age.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.845
You ever talked to a middle school boy?

36:21.929 --> 36:25.433
We're all like,
"I fucked 100 girls last recess, bro."

36:26.350 --> 36:27.643
"You're a virgin."

36:27.727 --> 36:30.938
And then, we'll finally see porn
a year later, and we're like,

36:31.022 --> 36:32.565
"Oh shit!"

36:33.357 --> 36:36.652
"Pussy is so much lower
than I thought it was."

36:38.196 --> 36:42.116
But before we see porn,
every boy thinks a pussy is right here.

36:43.117 --> 36:46.495
We think we walk dick-first
into your belly button, and that's just...

36:47.121 --> 36:49.498
That's what doing sex is.
You know what I mean?

36:50.374 --> 36:51.917
You hope she got an innie.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.592
So it's... it's a lot of new information
to try to digest, you know?

37:00.676 --> 37:02.344
I'm enjoyin' myself. I'm excited.

37:02.428 --> 37:05.765
Can't wait to go to school.
Tell my friends. I know I'mma be the man.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.183
But because I was so caught up,

37:08.267 --> 37:10.185
I made the biggest rookie mistake.

37:10.269 --> 37:14.482
I... I... I didn't even think...
to... put it back.

37:15.733 --> 37:19.070
I put the box and blankets back,
but I was like, "He's got plenty."

37:19.820 --> 37:22.156
There's no way
he's gonna notice one missing, right?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.073
Wrong.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.619
The same night, dude, around 11:00 p.m.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.830
I didn't even get this tape for 24 hours.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.375
I'm in my room,
packing up for school the next day.

37:33.459 --> 37:37.588
Backpack's full, I'm crawling in bed.
I'm fuckin' exhausted.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.177
From all the notes.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.264
And I'm nice and cozy under the sheets,

37:47.348 --> 37:48.640
comfy under the covers,

37:48.724 --> 37:52.645
and I hear my stepdad come home
from working his late-night shift.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.023
The sounds in the house were
routine every single night.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.483
I could paint the picture
and see what he was doing

37:58.567 --> 38:00.068
without seeing what he was doing.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.778
All the sounds are the same every night.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.990
You'd hear him come through the garage
into the kitchen, crack a beer,

38:05.074 --> 38:06.826
come through the living room
into the bedroom,

38:07.410 --> 38:10.204
where you hear him turn on the shower
and get outta his work clothes.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.414
Just like every night.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.332
Only this night,

38:14.166 --> 38:15.501
I hear him crack the beer,

38:16.210 --> 38:18.546
come through the living room
into the bedroom...

38:20.464 --> 38:21.382
no shower.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.761
Just like 20-25 seconds of silence.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.139
And then, I hear

38:28.723 --> 38:30.349
throughout the house...

38:32.435 --> 38:33.686
"What the fuck?"

38:42.862 --> 38:45.823
I'm in my room, like,
"That could be anything."

38:48.534 --> 38:50.535
I hope my mom's cheating in there.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.124
I hope he walked in
on five other people in his house.

38:58.127 --> 39:02.256
Because that exclamation
was followed by another two minutes

39:03.007 --> 39:04.592
of just silence.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.804
So I'm... I'm in my room,
like, "What the fuck is going on?"

39:10.556 --> 39:12.641
Because then, I hear the footsteps again.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.605
They're getting closer and heavier.

39:18.689 --> 39:22.068
I'm sweating and hard,
a terrifying combination at that age.

39:24.445 --> 39:28.115
It was the first time in my life I hoped
mysterious footsteps was a ghost...

39:29.617 --> 39:33.162
...preferably the ghost of my real dad,
so this wasn't about to happen.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.956
I knew he was gonna whoop my ass.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.500
I knew I was in trouble.
My bed monster was holdin' my hand.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.711
I'm like, "Not right now. Chill, chill."

39:41.420 --> 39:43.088
"Maybe after. We'll see how this goes."

39:43.172 --> 39:44.006
Um...

39:44.965 --> 39:47.343
The footsteps stop at my bedroom door.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.805
I'm like, "Fuck!"

39:51.639 --> 39:53.515
The door creaks open,

39:56.352 --> 39:58.896
and my stepdad leans in,

39:59.522 --> 40:01.857
and all he says is...

40:03.484 --> 40:05.444
"I'm missing something."

40:13.369 --> 40:14.995
"I know you know

40:16.664 --> 40:17.748
what I know,

40:19.291 --> 40:22.002
and when I get home from work tomorrow,

40:23.003 --> 40:24.672
I want it back

40:26.173 --> 40:27.883
and rewound."

40:39.937 --> 40:42.564
I was like,
"To the beginning or where you finished?"

40:44.984 --> 40:47.652
We gotta come up
with some kind of time system now.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.947
This... this is our collection now, okay?

40:51.157 --> 40:52.657
He was like, "You wanna be grounded?"

40:52.741 --> 40:55.577
"Gonna keep me in my room
with this movie? I guess, lock me up."

40:55.661 --> 40:56.536
Know what I mean?

40:56.620 --> 40:58.080
All summer, baby. I'm good.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.583
It was a real turning point
in he and I's relationship

41:01.667 --> 41:04.378
'cause we hated each other,
we had nothing in common,

41:04.462 --> 41:06.589
but... but we... we finally had a thing.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.841
You know, I...
I finally had leverage for once.

41:09.925 --> 41:13.428
We couldn't snitch on the other person
without losing everything. It was nice.

41:13.512 --> 41:17.057
You could either beat me or your dick.
You ain't gonna do both, okay.

41:18.767 --> 41:19.602
Deal?

41:20.352 --> 41:21.186
Deal?

41:29.778 --> 41:31.947
That's how we bonded.
You know? It was nice.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.200
Oh, man.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.625
Yeah. That was
a good bonding experience, man.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.879
Then, the Internet had to come
and ruin everythin'.

41:47.963 --> 41:51.383
I like Internet porn, but you can't bond
with your family anymore.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.304
I hate the Internet. I really do.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.181
Social media... I can't stand social media,

41:58.265 --> 42:01.727
which I know is crazy for y'all to hear
'cause it's why you're all here.

42:03.229 --> 42:06.106
That's a fun fact for you to know.
I hate social media.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.276
I never wanted to do it.
I put it off for years. I can't stand it.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.571
I think social media is awful,
such a negative, toxic place.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.866
It's full of horrible people
saying horrible things all the time.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.326
It's the worst place to never exist, man.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.540
It's awful what people say,

42:23.624 --> 42:26.335
these... these... these people,
these... trolls.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.463
It's a bunch of fuckin' losers

42:30.381 --> 42:32.258
with no friends and no life,

42:32.841 --> 42:34.217
and no profile picture.

42:36.303 --> 42:39.222
Sit at home all day
trying to... ...cancel people,

42:39.306 --> 42:43.018
or say mean comments
'cause their life sucks so fuckin' bad

42:43.102 --> 42:45.770
they can't possibly imagine
a life of misery by themselves.

42:45.854 --> 42:48.857
They have to try to drag other people down
by leaving mean comments

42:48.941 --> 42:50.317
and saying rude stuff.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.155
I respond every time.
Every time, dude. I...

42:55.239 --> 42:56.406
I can't not!

42:56.490 --> 42:58.450
I can't-- I cannot fathom a reality

42:58.534 --> 43:01.119
where people can talk to you
as disrespectful as they want

43:01.203 --> 43:03.538
without facing any physical consequences.

43:03.622 --> 43:06.291
That drives me absolutely insane, man.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.209
And I know--

43:07.293 --> 43:09.295
I--

43:10.129 --> 43:13.173
I know... I... I know as a...
"...public figure,"

43:13.257 --> 43:17.594
I'm supposed to be, like,
the bigger person and take the high road,

43:17.678 --> 43:20.347
but fuckin' kill yourself, dude. I...

43:21.473 --> 43:24.351
That goes for any Internet shit talker
out there, man.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.770
And I know that's
a harsh thing to say to somebody,

43:26.854 --> 43:29.231
but the way I see it,
nobody who's a good person

43:29.315 --> 43:32.484
and actually contributes
anything positive to society

43:32.568 --> 43:35.445
is ever gonna go out of their way
to leave a negative comment

43:35.529 --> 43:38.406
under something you've been so brave
as to create and share with the world,

43:38.490 --> 43:40.659
and we just don't need
people like that around.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.911
Sorry.

43:46.123 --> 43:50.586
It's just insane the lengths people
will go to talk shit on the Internet, man.

43:51.086 --> 43:54.923
Earlier this year, we were flying
from Los Angeles up to Vancouver, Canada

43:55.007 --> 43:56.383
for a comedy festival.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.970
I had one show, one night. It was
a 36-hour trip. Real quick, in and out.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.721
Right? Head to the airport.

44:01.805 --> 44:04.224
The only thing I've brought
with me was my backpack,

44:04.308 --> 44:07.060
which you'd think would be ideal
except for it's an inconvenience

44:07.144 --> 44:08.728
as soon as you get to the airport

44:08.812 --> 44:11.940
'cause TSA doesn't know
where the fuck a backpack goes,

44:12.024 --> 44:16.319
and they change the rules every day
and then treat you like you're an idiot

44:16.403 --> 44:18.530
for not knowing
their made-up set of rules.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.158
This specific occasion, I get through TSA,

44:22.242 --> 44:23.743
little to no issues.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.954
They don't have to pull the bag aside.

44:26.038 --> 44:28.248
Now, I'm heading to the gate,
heading to the plane.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.292
I'm actually pretty excited
about the flight

44:30.376 --> 44:33.003
'cause it's not that long,
and I know I have a window seat,

44:33.087 --> 44:35.589
which is inarguably
the best seat on the plane.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.385
Yeah. Yeah, until the end of the flight.

44:41.178 --> 44:44.223
'Cause you know how they come by
to let you know they're about to land?

44:46.058 --> 44:48.435
Fifty-five minutes
before they're about to land.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.271
And they will...

44:51.355 --> 44:54.274
And they will wake you up
from your window slumber

44:54.358 --> 44:56.067
just to say some stupid shit like,

44:56.151 --> 44:58.612
"I need you to put your window shade

44:58.696 --> 45:00.698
all the way up for landing."

45:01.198 --> 45:04.826
Like this motherfucker
checking his blind spot in 28F.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.797
So, I'm at least looking forward
to gettin' a little nap on the flight.

45:17.881 --> 45:20.175
So we're boarding the plane.
It's a smaller plane,

45:20.259 --> 45:21.676
one you've all been on,

45:21.760 --> 45:25.305
where the overhead bins are so small
they make you gate-check all your luggage.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.390
So I lucked out just having the backpack

45:27.474 --> 45:31.311
'cause even if the bag did fit in the bin,
which it didn't. Too small.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.022
Everybody knows your backpack
goes under the seat in front.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.733
I know that, you know that.
I do it six times a week.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.444
So I'm settlin' into the seat,
putting the bag under,

45:39.528 --> 45:40.904
and I had made a small mistake.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.615
I... I had overpacked the bag
by just a little bit.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.077
So it only fit, like,
75% under the seat in front of me.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.621
So I'm feelin' it out
and I'm like, you know what?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.624
I'll have more room
and be more comfortable

45:52.708 --> 45:55.543
if I put my bag
underneath my legs this way.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.170
So much more room.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.339
I... I... I could still mermaid a little bit.

46:00.632 --> 46:02.801
Problem solved.
Now, I'm sitting back relaxing,

46:02.885 --> 46:06.012
waiting to see who's gonna sit next to me
'cause who sits next to you

46:06.096 --> 46:08.932
plays a huge impact
on your flight experience, right?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.018
I get fucked immediately.

46:12.352 --> 46:14.604
Dude, right behind me
in the boarding process,

46:14.688 --> 46:17.649
here comes two of the worst possible
passengers to sit next to.

46:17.733 --> 46:22.445
Beside me in the middle seat,
is a three-year-old boy who--

46:22.529 --> 46:25.824
Yeah, as soon as he sits down,
is on his three-year-old...

46:31.789 --> 46:34.082
I'm just like, man.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.793
I will cave
this motherfucker's sternum in.

46:36.877 --> 46:37.711
Okay?

46:38.670 --> 46:40.296
I bet it's still soft.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.259
And... I'm pissed off.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.929
Not at the crying. Your baby crying
on a plane doesn't even bother me.

46:48.013 --> 46:50.724
I know you can't control that,
but what you can control

46:50.808 --> 46:53.435
is the physicality of your child.

46:53.519 --> 46:56.020
'Cause for the rest
of this 30-minute boarding process,

46:56.104 --> 46:59.817
this kid would not get his hand

47:00.651 --> 47:02.819
this far away from my face.

47:02.903 --> 47:03.737
Just...

47:06.156 --> 47:08.491
And I'm doing all the polite things
to get him away.

47:08.575 --> 47:11.953
I'm like, "Okay, but...
Okay, all right. Probably..."

47:12.037 --> 47:14.581
"Probably enough.
Somebody can break this up?"

47:14.665 --> 47:17.667
I'm doing all the things
to let the dad know

47:17.751 --> 47:20.920
this isn't okay,
and he's not paying attention.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.131
I was this close
to leaning over to the dad

47:23.215 --> 47:24.383
and being like, "Hey!"

47:25.217 --> 47:28.845
"You mind getting
your sexy-ass kid away from me."

47:38.438 --> 47:40.399
Yeah. I know that's gross.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.568
But what do I gotta do

47:43.694 --> 47:47.572
to get your attention
to let you know this is inappropriate.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.116
What's going on over here?

47:50.617 --> 47:52.619
The dad could not have been
more incompetent.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.830
He was in the aisle seat
watching shit on his iPad,

47:55.914 --> 47:57.457
and the... the dad was...

47:58.208 --> 48:00.752
No disrespect, just an accurate detail

48:00.836 --> 48:05.632
to the story, but the dad was no less
than I'd... I'd say 425 pounds.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.884
Like, he... he was a big dude.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.386
If I had to piss on this flight,
it was gonna be in my seat,

48:10.470 --> 48:13.181
which I fully accepted. It's... it's fine.

48:13.807 --> 48:16.935
So I'm just...
...trying to keep my composure.

48:17.019 --> 48:19.395
We're departing from the gate,
heading towards the runway,

48:19.479 --> 48:22.357
and the flight attendant's
making her rounds up and down,

48:22.441 --> 48:25.444
make sure everyone's buckled in,
and she stopped at my row.

48:25.986 --> 48:29.280
She saw my bag under my legs,
and she goes,

48:29.364 --> 48:30.198
"Uh-huh."

48:31.658 --> 48:32.492
"Sir,

48:33.076 --> 48:36.120
I'm gonna need you to put your bag
under the seat in front of you."

48:36.204 --> 48:37.539
I said, "Ahh."

48:39.207 --> 48:41.126
"Doesn't fit, but it's okay."

48:41.710 --> 48:42.544
"Look."

48:44.171 --> 48:46.256
"Still got plenty of space,
super comfortable."

48:46.340 --> 48:48.132
"I wouldn't even worry about it.
Thank you."

48:48.216 --> 48:50.302
And she goes, "It's not okay."

48:51.053 --> 48:52.846
"Put your bag
under the seat in front of you,

48:52.930 --> 48:56.308
or I will check it where you can go
get it at baggage claim."

48:58.352 --> 49:00.520
I s-- I said, "It... it doesn't fit,

49:01.188 --> 49:04.107
and... we've already departed."

49:06.944 --> 49:08.320
"What do you wanna do?"

49:09.738 --> 49:11.823
And she said, "I don't know,

49:11.907 --> 49:14.242
not my bag, not my problem."

49:17.287 --> 49:20.415
I said, "You're not gonna speak to me
like this is Spirit Airlines, okay?"

49:22.876 --> 49:24.378
"I am an American

49:25.420 --> 49:28.256
Platinum Rewards Executive Pro member."

49:28.340 --> 49:29.299
"Okay?"

49:29.383 --> 49:32.927
"And I have enough miles
for us to speak like adults

49:33.011 --> 49:36.097
and agree that we both know
that's a stupid rule."

49:36.181 --> 49:37.599
"It's not affecting anything."

49:38.183 --> 49:39.017
"Look."

49:41.019 --> 49:43.438
"Let's just drop it
and move on with the flight."

49:44.022 --> 49:47.442
She goes, "It's not a stupid rule.
It's impeding your exit."

49:47.526 --> 49:48.360
I said, "Oh."

49:49.403 --> 49:50.237
"For real?"

49:52.364 --> 49:55.241
"Trapped. First one off is bitch."

49:57.869 --> 49:59.954
"I promise you it's okay."

50:00.038 --> 50:02.415
"It's not okay. If there's an emergency,

50:02.499 --> 50:05.418
you need to be able to get off
as quickly as possible."

50:05.502 --> 50:06.837
I said, "Hey,

50:07.462 --> 50:10.382
what do you think's
impeding my exit more?"

50:12.050 --> 50:14.260
"My bag

50:14.344 --> 50:17.221
or fuckin' Timon and Pumbaa...

50:17.305 --> 50:18.723
...right next to me."

50:28.734 --> 50:29.568
"Huh?"

50:30.652 --> 50:32.988
Even the baby was like... "Ahh!"
And I was like,

50:34.031 --> 50:36.741
You're pissing off
this sexy-ass baby, man.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.376
So now...

50:47.419 --> 50:51.298
believe it or not,
<i>now</i> is when the trouble actually begins.

50:52.799 --> 50:53.717
I'm on the plane,

50:54.676 --> 50:55.761
I'm pissed off,

50:56.845 --> 50:57.929
and I've got Wi-Fi.

51:01.099 --> 51:02.725
So, like an idiot,

51:02.809 --> 51:05.228
as soon as I get service,
I get on Twitter,

51:05.312 --> 51:07.271
and I tweet about
what I just went through.

51:07.355 --> 51:11.693
Basically, all I tweeted was just stating
that I thought this was a ridiculous rule

51:11.777 --> 51:15.238
for her to threaten to check my bag
and add this very inconvenient process

51:15.322 --> 51:16.948
to my very quick in-and-out trip

51:17.032 --> 51:19.367
when it wasn't affecting
anybody or anything.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.411
That's all I tweeted.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.039
And, man.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.585
I didn't know that Twitter is

51:29.419 --> 51:34.966
all...

51:35.050 --> 51:36.676
...flight attendants, all of them.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.512
Every single one of them.

51:39.596 --> 51:41.931
Everybody on Twitter
knows every airplane rule,

51:42.015 --> 51:45.101
and they give the most amount
of fucks about them, apparently.

51:45.185 --> 51:48.521
Dude, hundreds, on hundreds,

51:48.605 --> 51:50.189
on hundreds

51:50.273 --> 51:54.110
of strangers start filling my timeline
with the angriest tweets,

51:54.194 --> 51:56.154
furious at my stance on the situation.

51:56.238 --> 51:59.532
And the dumb general consensus
they would say was shit, like...

51:59.616 --> 52:03.411
"How hard could it be
to just follow the rules?"

52:07.374 --> 52:08.708
Here's the thing.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.419
I understand rules.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.422
I understand
why safety precautions are set

52:14.506 --> 52:15.673
to keep everybody safe.

52:15.757 --> 52:16.924
Obviously, I get that.

52:17.008 --> 52:17.968
But also,

52:18.718 --> 52:20.595
use your fuckin' brain, right?

52:21.304 --> 52:24.640
For example, I understand
that the speed limit on most freeways,

52:24.724 --> 52:26.476
and it varies from city to city,

52:26.560 --> 52:29.854
but on average,
it's about 65 miles per hour.

52:29.938 --> 52:33.275
I totally understand and respect
that is the designated,

52:34.109 --> 52:35.777
suggested speed

52:37.028 --> 52:38.571
for us citizens to follow

52:38.655 --> 52:41.992
to keep traffic moving
at an appropriate pace. I get that.

52:42.784 --> 52:43.785
But also,

52:44.911 --> 52:46.955
if you for real

52:47.998 --> 52:52.252
drive 65 miles per hour

52:52.752 --> 52:54.421
on the freeway,

52:55.505 --> 52:57.757
I will fuckin' kill you,
do you understand?

52:57.841 --> 52:59.968
Ha!

53:02.262 --> 53:04.597
Drive faster, pussy.

53:06.349 --> 53:10.103
Use your instincts to go, "You know what?
I can open this bitch up

53:10.187 --> 53:13.439
to 80 like an adult

53:13.523 --> 53:15.191
and keep this shit moving."

53:15.275 --> 53:16.860
Right? You use...

53:17.527 --> 53:19.946
You use your instincts
to navigate rules, right?

53:20.030 --> 53:22.490
That's how I felt
about the plane situation.

53:22.574 --> 53:25.368
I know what the bag rule is,
everybody does,

53:25.452 --> 53:27.078
but it's not affecting anybody

53:27.162 --> 53:29.372
so how about we chill
the fuck out about it?

53:30.540 --> 53:31.374
Nope.

53:31.958 --> 53:35.795
Instead, I argue
with 700 strangers for eight hours, dude.

53:36.296 --> 53:39.841
Oh, and we're twerkling
back and forth and back and forth.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.052
And-- The best part about arguing
with people on the Internet

53:43.136 --> 53:45.429
about something
you've personally experienced,

53:45.513 --> 53:50.893
is that they weren't there to witness
any of the details of the account, right?

53:50.977 --> 53:54.939
They only know what you've told them
and what they wanna assume.

53:55.023 --> 53:57.233
So, very quickly after you start arguing,

53:57.317 --> 54:00.611
people will just start throwing out
their own wild scenarios

54:00.695 --> 54:03.406
that have nothing to do
with what you're even talking about

54:03.490 --> 54:05.158
just so they seem justified.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.535
I just didn't wanna check my bag,

54:07.619 --> 54:10.663
and people were saying things like,
"It's not about your safety."

54:10.747 --> 54:12.456
"It's about the safety
of people around you."

54:12.540 --> 54:15.251
"What if there's an emergency
crash landing into a mountain,

54:15.335 --> 54:16.878
and during the evacuation..."

54:17.879 --> 54:20.090
"Say it again slower
for yourself. Go ahead."

54:21.049 --> 54:24.344
"You think we're gonna survive the crash?"

54:25.345 --> 54:26.846
"Into the mountain?"

54:27.931 --> 54:30.892
And they have an argument for everything.
"But what if we do survive?"

54:30.976 --> 54:33.394
"And because your bag
wasn't all the way under the seat,

54:33.478 --> 54:37.190
it ends up in the aisleway
and someone trips over it

54:37.274 --> 54:38.441
and injures themself?"

54:47.158 --> 54:48.952
If you...

54:50.620 --> 54:51.538
can't...

54:52.747 --> 54:53.957
step

54:54.833 --> 54:57.752
the fuck over

54:58.753 --> 55:01.256
my ten-inch tall

55:02.048 --> 55:04.718
JanSport backpack

55:05.677 --> 55:08.555
to save your own life,

55:09.681 --> 55:12.308
natural selection, dawg.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.904
You gotta fuckin' die.

55:25.405 --> 55:26.239
Okay.

55:26.823 --> 55:29.075
You're not athletic enough to stay alive.

55:30.952 --> 55:34.080
Dude, I... I could not believe

55:34.622 --> 55:36.791
the lengths people will go to

55:36.875 --> 55:40.294
to argue about shit that has nothing
to do with them on the Internet.

55:40.378 --> 55:44.006
It's impressive, man,
because it snowballs very quickly.

55:44.090 --> 55:47.635
It quickly becomes this mob mentality
'cause what happens online is

55:47.719 --> 55:49.553
once a large enough group of people

55:49.637 --> 55:51.681
start getting upset
with you on the Internet,

55:51.765 --> 55:53.975
everybody wants to get their lickin',

55:54.059 --> 55:56.894
'cause it's full of people
who have negativity towards themself

55:56.978 --> 55:58.854
that they have to project
onto other people.

55:58.938 --> 56:01.148
This is their opportunity
'cause that's your punishment.

56:01.232 --> 56:03.150
If you ever get in trouble
on the Internet,

56:03.234 --> 56:05.236
your punishment is that people can say

56:06.112 --> 56:08.365
anything they want to you.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.701
Anything, even if it's way worse

56:11.785 --> 56:14.412
than what you said
to get in trouble in the first place.

56:14.496 --> 56:17.498
It's impressive, and ultimately,
that stuff never bothers me.

56:17.582 --> 56:18.666
Like, l... look.

56:18.750 --> 56:21.711
You're never gonna hurt my feelings.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.130
Okay, I've been dead inside for so long.

56:24.714 --> 56:27.341
Like, my... my plane crashed
a long time ago,

56:27.425 --> 56:29.802
and I didn't step over the bag,
emotionally speaking.

56:29.886 --> 56:31.096
Ya know what I mean, so--

56:32.222 --> 56:33.848
You can talk your shit
as much as you want.

56:33.932 --> 56:36.600
The thing you have to know about me
and what I've learned,

56:36.684 --> 56:39.020
through therapy or whatever, is that I'm...

56:39.604 --> 56:42.857
...I'm a very defensive person, apparently.

56:42.941 --> 56:46.694
I... I have a very quick trigger reaction
to feel the need to defend myself

56:46.778 --> 56:48.946
if I feel like somebody is coming at me.

56:49.030 --> 56:50.990
And I... I go for the kill every time.

56:51.074 --> 56:53.909
So look, you can talk your shit
to me online as much as you want,

56:53.993 --> 56:56.829
say whatever mean,
hurtful things you wanna say

56:56.913 --> 56:59.248
to try to hurt my feelings, but just know,

57:00.625 --> 57:04.421
I'm gonna fuck you up verbally, dude.
I'm...

57:04.921 --> 57:07.340
My goal is to now make you cry.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.633
Like, I'm gonna win
this battle every time.

57:09.717 --> 57:12.720
So when I hit you harder
than you hit me first,

57:13.221 --> 57:16.557
don't act like
you're the fuckin' victim, okay?

57:16.641 --> 57:20.061
That's my biggest pet peeve
in the entire Internet, and...

57:22.605 --> 57:23.440
...probably...

57:24.691 --> 57:27.943
probably the best example of that
was throughout this Twitter interaction

57:28.027 --> 57:30.196
when all this backpack shit was going on.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.948
I'm arguing with people,
we're going roast for roast,

57:33.032 --> 57:35.117
just really having some fun wastin' time.

57:35.201 --> 57:36.453
I was having fun with it.

57:37.245 --> 57:39.205
Then, there was this one woman.
Took it too far.

57:39.289 --> 57:44.168
She would not shut the fuck up, dude.

57:44.252 --> 57:48.715
She, by herself,
probably tweeted me like 60 to 70 times

57:49.507 --> 57:52.218
whether I responded or not,
and I responded to a lot.

57:52.302 --> 57:55.054
But not... not all of them obviously.

57:55.722 --> 57:58.224
She was one of those people,
saw everybody getting their lick

57:58.308 --> 58:02.436
and she wanted to be a part of that,
so she started saying meaner and meaner

58:02.520 --> 58:05.147
and meaner things
expecting no consequences,

58:05.231 --> 58:06.483
and I didn't really care.

58:07.442 --> 58:09.194
Until her last tweet.

58:10.153 --> 58:13.990
The last tweet, I just couldn't let slide.
The last thing she said to me was,

58:14.949 --> 58:19.453
"I don't understand why you have to be
such an insubordinate <i>,</i>

58:19.537 --> 58:21.497
crybaby, little bitch."

58:28.755 --> 58:30.548
Should I just have blocked her?

58:32.300 --> 58:34.218
My publicist says yes.

58:37.764 --> 58:39.474
But I was so sick

58:40.141 --> 58:42.184
of being ganged up on

58:42.268 --> 58:44.479
1-v-700.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.273
She was being very mean.

58:48.816 --> 58:50.860
She started it.

58:52.737 --> 58:55.531
And... just based off of her profile photo,

58:55.615 --> 59:00.161
she was a, um...

59:00.245 --> 59:02.830
...heavier-set woman.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.208
All I said...

59:07.252 --> 59:08.878
in defense of myself,

59:10.296 --> 59:12.715
was, "Well..."

59:14.926 --> 59:17.928
"...had you not been taking up two seats...

59:20.640 --> 59:24.059
...there would have been room
for me to safely secure my backpack

59:24.143 --> 59:25.645
in another chair."

59:27.146 --> 59:29.440
That's all I said, which...

59:29.524 --> 59:32.693
statistically is not incorrect.

59:34.612 --> 59:36.030
But as we all know,

59:36.614 --> 59:38.741
everybody wants to be a victim now, right?

59:39.242 --> 59:40.660
So how did she,

59:41.202 --> 59:44.247
the person who started it, react?

59:47.500 --> 59:50.044
"How could he say something like that?"

59:50.128 --> 59:51.921
"He's body-shaming me."

59:52.505 --> 59:54.548
"Cancel Matt Rife."

59:54.632 --> 59:57.760
"Bitch, you can't cancel me.
I'm not your gym membership."

59:57.844 --> 59:59.970
"Get the fuck off my feed then."

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.687
I didn't start shit with you.

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:11.690
I'm a nice person, man.
I never wanna hurt anybody's feelings,

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.234
but I fuckin' will.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.027
audience laughing

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.071
It had nothing to do with her, man.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.074
All I wanted to do
was complain about my backpack.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.202
And now I'm this bitch's 13th reason.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.328
Okay.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.417
No. No, fuck that.
You can count reasons, but not calories.

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:33.838
Get the fuck outta my face, dude.
No. Nope. Nope.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:35.839
Nope.

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:38.217
Not doing sympathy today, D.C.
Not doing it.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:43.389
And before any of y'all sit there
even think about taking her side.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.142
You go...
"Oh, I don't know, Matt."

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.602
"That's awfully personal. I mean..."

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:51.605
"I mean, is it really worth
you making fun of her weight

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:52.898
in defense of yourself."

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.735
"What if word gets back to her
you're still making fun of her weight,

01:00:56.819 --> 01:01:00.072
and it affects her so severely
she does something drastic,

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:03.284
like, like, like, like...
like, hangs herself."

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.286
"How would that make you feel?"

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.372
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.917
How'd she get up there?

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.047
Huh?

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:18.633
Yeah.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.971
I'd be fuckin' amazed...

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.976
...that they make tow cables that strong.
I really would.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.812
I really fuckin' would, dude.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.443
Listen.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:39.737
Fuck these people, man.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.240
Your social media is your art.

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:44.950
You can create and share

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.452
whatever you want to share.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.037
And if anybody...

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.289
if anybody has a problem with that,

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.958
I say post more of that shit.

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:57.671
Shove it down their fuckin' throat, man.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:02:00.674
Do you have any idea how many people
don't like me or my comedy?

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:03.427
- You know what? I post every fuckin' day...
- Love you!

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:06.347
...'cause that's what feels right to me.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.264
It's--

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.394
It's what feels right,
and I'm just doing what I think is funny,

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:14.146
and all I can hope to come from that

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.982
is that it makes other people smile,
and it makes them happy.

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.652
That's all I ever want to come
from any of this.

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:24.615
So who cares
if absolutely nobody believes in you, man.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.909
Fuck these people. For 12 years,

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.827
nobody believed in me, man.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:32.248
And if I let that affect how I respected
my own thoughts and ideas,

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:36.335
I wouldn't be doing a Netflix Special
at Constitution Hall in my favorite city

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.795
in the entire country, man.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:44.886
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.106
But what do I know?
I only do crowd work, right?

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:21.922
Hope everybody enjoyed themselves.

01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:24.801
Old people, thank you for coming.
I know you have to be up soon.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:27.887
Did you know who I was when you...
when you came here?

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.638
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:31.432
They play TikTok on the Hallmark?

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:34.643
Shut up.

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:35.853
What is that?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.148
What's in here? We got, uh...

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.817
Is this weed edibles?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.319
Fifty milligrams, you murderer.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.447
If you fuck around
and take 50 mg on your first edible,

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:49.116
you will change your pronouns, dude.
Like, you will...

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.369
Black people, thank y'all.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:54.788
I think it's just y'all.

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:56.123
Ah, two.

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:59.168
I thought for sure I had
a more diverse fan base.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.795
Not as much.

01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:03.964
Oh. Okay. All right.
Let's not point 'em out.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:07.176
That feels very January 6th of y'all.
Let's chill out.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:11.680
I know. It's y'all's city. I know.
