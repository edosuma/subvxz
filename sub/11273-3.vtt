WEBVTT

00:10.540 --> 00:11.734
- Great game.
- Yeah. Hey, look,

00:11.957 --> 00:13.629
they're showing chicks
in the stands every--

00:13.874 --> 00:16.513
Oh, look at that one.
Come to papa!

00:16.791 --> 00:20.864
Oh, yeah, Cliffie, they didn't build that
stadium in Foxboro for nothing, pal.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.245
They sure didn't.
I'll bet it cost millions.

00:25.876 --> 00:28.231
I suppose you're wondering
why a person of my breeding

00:28.501 --> 00:32.210
would be working among
the lumpen proletariat.

00:33.085 --> 00:36.555
Do you mind?
I'm researching a novel,

00:36.877 --> 00:43.146
and working here gives me
insight into their simple pleasures.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.805
Oh, wait, wait. They're zooming in
on a cheerleader here.

00:49.129 --> 00:51.518
I think I've zoomed in
on that one myself.

00:52.546 --> 00:57.142
This language supplies the rich texture
that distinguished Fitzgerald's work.

00:57.547 --> 00:59.617
Cliffie, here comes the wave.

01:07.882 --> 01:10.157
Well, you have to go along with them,
or they get testy.

01:14.383 --> 01:17.341
That's good. Good.

02:31.936 --> 02:37.613
Seeing Baryshnikov dance Giselle
was the experience of a lifetime.

02:38.062 --> 02:43.182
When he took the stage in his cabriole,
it was breathtaking.

02:43.563 --> 02:49.195
- I'd never seen his Albrecht before.
- You mean he split his tights?

02:52.647 --> 02:54.797
I wish.

02:57.481 --> 03:00.154
Hey, Diane, you got a minute?

03:02.649 --> 03:06.528
Listen, I want you to know
that you are the last person on earth

03:06.858 --> 03:08.052
that I would ask for help.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.425
But I figure you've been in college
for a zillion years,

03:10.692 --> 03:12.125
so you must have
picked up something.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.090
- Now that you've buttered me up...
- Well, my kid Gino,

03:16.401 --> 03:18.756
he made this generator
for his school science fair,

03:19.026 --> 03:21.779
- and he can't get it to work.
- What's the problem?

03:22.068 --> 03:24.298
He's not very smart.

03:24.610 --> 03:25.929
Here, take a look at this thing.

03:26.152 --> 03:29.701
If you're asking me to do
Gino's homework for him, I won't.

03:30.069 --> 03:32.264
It's unethical.

03:34.153 --> 03:36.030
- Hey, Mrs T?
- What?

03:36.279 --> 03:40.192
You know, you ought to ask
Mr Clavin. He's very sharp.

03:40.571 --> 03:45.326
He's got more information in his whole
head than I got in my little finger.

03:45.738 --> 03:48.696
- You got that backwards.
- See?

03:51.906 --> 03:55.057
Oh, yeah, Carla, it is common
knowledge that I'm scientifically handy.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.755
As a matter of fact, I spent a good part
of my youth in a laboratory.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.389
And you'd still be there today

04:00.616 --> 04:03.335
if the chimpanzee hadn't taught you
how to open your cage.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.100
Hey. Will you look at that?

04:07.408 --> 04:10.241
One of those
new marital aids, huh?

04:12.034 --> 04:15.993
Okay, Clavin,
the science fair is in one week.

04:16.326 --> 04:19.317
This is your chance to either
gain my respect or lose your tonsils.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.015
Hey, well,
thanks for the opportunity, Carla.

04:22.327 --> 04:25.205
So, Norm, what do you say?
You wanna give me a hand here?

04:25.494 --> 04:30.249
No. I think I'll pass,
Dr Frankenstein.

04:30.662 --> 04:33.017
Cliff, have one on the house
here for your good deed.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.047
Oh, thank you, Sammy.

04:36.288 --> 04:38.722
What about one for lgor?

04:44.997 --> 04:46.715
Sam, who's sitting here?

04:46.997 --> 04:49.795
I don't know, but his coat's
been taking up bar space all night.

04:50.581 --> 04:54.256
So I've noticed.
Cashmere. Very nice.

04:54.624 --> 05:00.540
Hand stitching. Tortoiseshell buttons.
This is a very expensive garment.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.956
Doesn't look that expensive to me.

05:03.875 --> 05:05.627
It has a Bemberg lining.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.192
Oh, well, no fair, now.
You didn't mention that.

05:09.918 --> 05:14.196
I'm gonna hang it up.
Oh, a pipe smoker.

05:14.543 --> 05:17.899
I don't believe it's a domestic blend.
Sam, what do you think?

05:19.461 --> 05:22.931
- I don't smell anything.
- Of course not.

05:23.253 --> 05:25.562
Your olfactory senses have
been destroyed

05:25.837 --> 05:27.589
by that cologne you
marinate in.

05:30.879 --> 05:33.916
Oh, I should've known.
Of course, it's a perique blend.

05:35.171 --> 05:38.925
Jack Meechan, my father's partner,
used to smoke it.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.103
The memory's so clearly
etched in my mind.

05:42.381 --> 05:46.613
He'd sit in his office smoking his pipe.
I'd beg to sit in his lap, and he'd say,

05:47.006 --> 05:49.918
"Okay, little miss,
but you have to pay the toll first."

05:50.215 --> 05:51.967
So I'd give him a big hug,
and then he'd ask,

05:52.215 --> 05:53.648
"How about a tip
for the gatekeeper?"

05:53.882 --> 05:57.238
So I'd give him a peck on the cheek,
and he'd toss me in the air, yelling,

05:57.550 --> 06:01.623
"Who's your favourite uncle?" And
I'd squeal, "Uncle Jack, Uncle Jack."

06:03.342 --> 06:06.379
Was this before or after
you met me?

06:08.760 --> 06:12.435
This is weird. What are you
making a big deal about the coat for?

06:12.802 --> 06:15.635
I was merely trying to conjure up
an image of the owner.

06:15.927 --> 06:20.637
There's nothing wrong with that.
Fantasy's healthy. Everybody does it.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.241
Didn't you ever
fantasize about me?

06:24.679 --> 06:26.271
Yeah, I guess I did.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.293
And I you.
What did you fantasize about?

06:30.638 --> 06:33.710
Mostly that you'd stop
using phrases like, "And I you."

06:36.430 --> 06:39.024
Okay, Watson, fire up.

06:45.682 --> 06:47.354
Cliffie, are you all right?

06:47.682 --> 06:51.311
It went right from my neck
to my lower regions, Norm.

06:53.850 --> 06:56.410
- Anything we can do?
- Yeah.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.117
Crank it up again.

07:03.601 --> 07:05.990
Woody, would you add up
these receipts for me, please?

07:06.310 --> 07:07.743
Sure.

07:11.394 --> 07:13.271
There's eight of them.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.993
Thank you, Woody.
That's what I got too.

07:19.895 --> 07:22.204
Hey, Sam, this guy
never came back for his coat.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.557
Probably saw Diane sniffing it.

07:26.729 --> 07:28.959
- Night, all.
- Night, Woody.

07:29.230 --> 07:33.189
- Okay, Sam, lost and found.
- Give me that.

07:34.147 --> 07:37.537
Maybe there's some identification.

07:38.564 --> 07:41.476
No wallet.
Well, there must be some clue here.

07:41.815 --> 07:46.525
You see?
Two tickets to the Grand Kabuki.

07:46.941 --> 07:51.014
So he likes to watch
two fat guys with diapers butt heads.

07:52.692 --> 07:55.968
- What's that tell you?
- That you're an idiot.

07:57.026 --> 08:00.905
You're confusing sumo wrestling
with classic Japanese theatre.

08:01.943 --> 08:04.696
Gee, please don't tell the guys.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.861
A dried rose. What a romantic.

08:10.736 --> 08:15.764
Could it be a memento from a golden
midi d'amour in some sylvan setting?

08:17.487 --> 08:20.763
What's that?
A classy way of saying a nooner?

08:22.988 --> 08:24.546
Boy, you're really losing it here.

08:24.780 --> 08:28.773
You know, you can't tell what a guy's
like by what he's got in his pocket.

08:29.322 --> 08:33.110
I certainly can.
What do you have in your pockets?

08:33.489 --> 08:36.720
Why don't you check it out
yourself and you tell me.

08:37.948 --> 08:40.542
I think my point is made.

08:46.366 --> 08:52.077
Has it occurred to you this guy may
look like Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy?

08:53.742 --> 08:55.653
I can tell you right now

08:55.951 --> 08:58.988
that the owner of this coat
could well be the most attractive man

08:59.285 --> 09:01.879
I've ever encountered,
whatever he looks like.

09:02.202 --> 09:04.238
Down, girl, down.

09:04.535 --> 09:08.244
What a person looks like has
nothing to do with who that person is.

09:08.619 --> 09:11.895
If my face were transposed
on another soul, would it matter?

09:12.245 --> 09:14.964
To the poor sap
who got it, it would.

09:19.371 --> 09:20.565
Cheers.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.900
Oh, well, hold on a sec. I'll check.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.631
Have we seen a cashmere coat
with Bemberg lining around here?

09:25.955 --> 09:26.944
Sam.

09:27.164 --> 09:30.236
Yeah, why don't you talk
to our coat-check girl.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.709
The dream man
for Miss Chambers.

09:35.290 --> 09:37.963
Hello.
My name is Diane Chambers,

09:38.249 --> 09:44.040
and I want you to rest assured that
your lovely coat is safe in my charge.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.745
I think we have a bad connection.

09:48.084 --> 09:49.676
Your car phone?

09:50.459 --> 09:52.529
You know,
I imagined you had a car phone.

09:53.334 --> 09:57.247
Well, what I meant was, is we were
playing this game, wondering

09:57.585 --> 09:59.621
what you'd be like
based on your coat.

10:00.835 --> 10:02.985
Me?
Well, close your eyes and imagine.

10:03.294 --> 10:06.172
Oh, no, don't.
We don't want you rear-ending a bus.

10:10.545 --> 10:13.981
Oh, forgive my merry sense of
humour. I get it from my mother's side.

10:14.296 --> 10:17.606
- Oh, my God.
- He sounds wonderful.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.993
Really? Well, why don't you
ask him out, then.

10:21.338 --> 10:22.976
Yes.

10:23.839 --> 10:25.670
Listen, you sound like
a charming man.

10:25.922 --> 10:30.438
If it's not too forward, perhaps we
could go for an espresso sometime?

10:30.840 --> 10:32.990
Sometime?
Now, there's a commitment for you.

10:34.424 --> 10:37.382
On second thought,
I'm getting off work now.

10:37.716 --> 10:40.355
If you're not busy,
we could do it tonight.

10:43.758 --> 10:47.546
Oh, we're both such spontaneous
madcaps, aren't we?

10:49.593 --> 10:52.903
You're right down the block?
Momentarily, then.

10:58.927 --> 11:02.840
Making a date with a stranger over
the telephone is a big mistake, Diane.

11:03.178 --> 11:05.738
I tried it.
It was nothing but trouble.

11:06.012 --> 11:08.890
Of course,
mine was an obscene phone call.

11:09.221 --> 11:13.737
I hope this works out. Busted
expectations are a real bummer.

11:14.138 --> 11:16.811
- I won't be disappointed.
- No, no, I was talking about him.

11:19.347 --> 11:23.056
Hey, hey, hey. Here comes
Mr Right down the steps as we speak.

11:23.973 --> 11:27.329
Socks.
He's already got my guy beat.

11:27.682 --> 11:31.721
- What, are you nervous there?
- Not at all.

11:44.976 --> 11:47.331
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:47.643 --> 11:51.556
- I bet you're the guy without the coat.
- Yes, I am. Diane?

11:51.893 --> 11:53.326
You should be so lucky.

11:57.436 --> 11:59.506
Diane.

12:00.353 --> 12:05.381
Aren't you going to introduce yourself
to this lovely gentleman?

12:05.812 --> 12:10.283
Of course I am. I was just waiting
for the proper moment.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.282
I'm Diane Chambers.
How do you do? Welcome to Cheers.

12:13.563 --> 12:15.838
I'm Stuart Sorenson.

12:16.272 --> 12:18.502
- Well.
- Yes.

12:19.523 --> 12:21.593
- Oh, good, you have my coat.
- Ah, yes.

12:21.856 --> 12:24.768
I can't tell you how grateful I am
for you taking such good care of it.

12:25.107 --> 12:27.780
Oh, it was my pleasure.
It's a lovely garment.

12:28.065 --> 12:29.339
Did you get it on the Continent?

12:29.607 --> 12:33.156
- France.
- "The Continent." Nice try, Diane.

12:34.191 --> 12:37.024
Hi, Stuart, I'm Sam Malone. I haven't
seen you in here before, have l?

12:37.317 --> 12:38.989
Well, I'm new to the Boston area.

12:39.234 --> 12:42.067
I'm in the midst of restoring
a carriage house on Beacon Hill.

12:42.359 --> 12:44.634
And I needed a break,
so I just wandered in here.

12:44.943 --> 12:47.013
- It's a nice little pub you have.
- Well, thank you.

12:47.277 --> 12:51.156
- That makes you a carpenter, huh?
- Sam, he's probably an architect.

12:51.527 --> 12:54.405
- Why, yes, I am an architect.
- An architect, you say?

12:54.694 --> 12:57.413
- Did you hear that, Sam?
- Three times.

12:59.778 --> 13:04.454
Listen, Diane, about that date, I realise
we made it over the phone and--

13:04.821 --> 13:06.971
Well, here's your chance
to back out.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.340
This lady's not going to let you
off that easily.

13:10.655 --> 13:13.010
But it was a nice try there, Stuart.

13:15.489 --> 13:17.559
Do you know a place
still open for espresso?

13:17.864 --> 13:20.776
As a matter of fact,
I know a wonderful little boîte.

13:21.073 --> 13:23.712
Every time I go there,
I'm reminded of the Café Lumière,

13:23.990 --> 13:25.901
opposite the Bois de Boulogne.

13:26.199 --> 13:27.871
I know exactly
the one you're talking about.

13:28.116 --> 13:29.993
It's in the lobby
of the Hôtel Sainte-Cécile.

13:30.283 --> 13:32.274
- Yes.
- Well.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.763
That's the only place I stay
when I'm in Paris.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.191
Oh, I'm sorry.
That sounded so pretentious.

13:39.159 --> 13:41.275
There's my car phone.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.181
That sounded pretentious too.

13:44.493 --> 13:46.085
Oh, hell, so I'm pretentious.

13:47.744 --> 13:52.579
- Do you mind if I go get that?
- Not at all. I'll meet you at your car.

13:57.995 --> 14:00.555
There's a back way out of here.
You gotta shinny up a drainpipe,

14:00.829 --> 14:04.299
crawl over some broken glass,
but I think it may be worth it.

14:05.163 --> 14:08.633
What are you talking about?
I feel totally vindicated.

14:08.955 --> 14:10.832
He's everything
I thought he would be.

14:11.122 --> 14:14.319
He's charming, intelligent,
self-deprecating.

14:14.665 --> 14:16.860
I didn't hear "attractive" in there.

14:18.498 --> 14:21.535
- I find him attractive.
- Oh, come on, Diane.

14:21.832 --> 14:25.905
On a scale of one to ten,
me being a 12, of course,

14:26.916 --> 14:29.669
where are you gonna rate Stuart?

14:30.959 --> 14:34.315
Let's change that to lQ.

14:34.626 --> 14:38.619
While your score would remain 12...

14:39.918 --> 14:41.909
...his would skyrocket.

14:42.210 --> 14:45.043
It's too bad you're not gonna be
gazing across the table at his lQ.

14:46.169 --> 14:48.444
Why don't you just admit
you're jealous.

14:48.753 --> 14:52.746
All right, I am.
You're right, but can you blame me?

14:54.212 --> 14:57.170
Sam, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

14:57.504 --> 15:00.780
You bet I am.
I'd kill for a car phone.

15:12.881 --> 15:15.031
Two vodka tonics.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.977
- So where's the stick?
- She and Stuart are on another date.

15:19.341 --> 15:22.219
They went to see a play.
I think it's a whodunit.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.222
With him in the audience,
it's a what-is-it.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.738
Hey, hey, come on.
Lighten up on him, will you?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.647
He turned out to be kind of
a nice fella.

15:28.925 --> 15:30.643
Gonna have to give
Diane credit on this one.

15:30.884 --> 15:32.681
Her intuition proved to be right.

15:32.968 --> 15:37.678
I'm a great believer in intuition.
It's like when I first saw you, Sam.

15:38.093 --> 15:41.051
Something told me you were
super smooth with the ladies.

15:41.386 --> 15:43.854
Maybe it was that time you
walked out of here with four of them,

15:44.136 --> 15:45.694
one on each arm.

15:45.928 --> 15:47.361
You know,

15:47.845 --> 15:50.439
you always just seem to know
the right moves.

15:50.762 --> 15:53.799
Sometimes I like to just stand around
and watch you operate.

15:54.096 --> 15:58.214
- It's like going to school.
- I never really thought of it like that.

15:58.597 --> 16:00.792
Well, yes, I have.

16:03.764 --> 16:06.801
Well, so there we were,

16:07.139 --> 16:11.735
me and 25 soaking wet
Japanese architects in my apartment,

16:12.098 --> 16:14.214
and I'm out of Brie.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.550
Oh, Stuart, what a life you've led.

16:20.891 --> 16:23.280
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll get our drinks.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.431
Hey, Stuart, how was the theatre?

16:25.726 --> 16:27.398
- Great fun, Sam.
- Oh, good.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.365
Hey, Miss Chambers?

16:31.768 --> 16:34.328
I've been meaning to tell you,
I really like your friend Stuart.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.115
Oh, thank you, Woody.

16:37.061 --> 16:39.700
Hey, you think you could get him
to do that great trick for me?

16:41.269 --> 16:42.668
What trick?

16:42.936 --> 16:46.531
The one Sam says he does when he
makes the clock stop by looking at it.

16:49.437 --> 16:52.588
Wasn't that just supposed to be
between you, me and the lamppost?

16:52.938 --> 16:55.691
Well, look at her.
It's an easy mistake.

17:00.147 --> 17:03.025
Excuse me.
I have to speak with Sam.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.869
I'll be back before
the bouquet leaves the glasses.

17:06.732 --> 17:08.688
Might I speak with you briefly?

17:10.107 --> 17:12.984
You might,
but I don't think you will.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.484
I'm sorry about that clock comment.

17:17.733 --> 17:20.645
I made it before I realised
what a nice guy he is.

17:24.026 --> 17:26.744
I'm such a pooh.

17:28.651 --> 17:31.529
- Beg your pardon?
- You heard me. A pooh.

17:34.861 --> 17:40.015
After all these years,
I have to admit it. I'm all talk.

17:40.987 --> 17:45.822
Oh, well, of course you are, honey,
but we've all gotten used to that.

17:48.113 --> 17:52.231
Sam, I have spent the week
with a person

17:52.613 --> 17:55.411
who can converse
on a multitude of subjects,

17:55.739 --> 17:59.015
who listens when I talk,

17:59.698 --> 18:02.212
who treats me with respect.

18:02.531 --> 18:04.726
And a person with whom
I can think of nothing but,

18:04.990 --> 18:07.550
"Why aren't you great-looking?"

18:08.657 --> 18:11.888
Or, "Why can't I stop wishing
you were great-looking?"

18:12.908 --> 18:15.138
This is probably not the right time
to say I told you so,

18:15.408 --> 18:18.798
so if you could just remind me
to get to it later.

18:20.242 --> 18:22.472
Oh, Sam.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.493
I'm small and vain and petty.

18:26.827 --> 18:30.615
Will you stop being hard on yourself?
I mean, that's my job here. Come on.

18:30.994 --> 18:34.225
You had, what, few casual
dates with him? What's the big deal?

18:34.578 --> 18:36.853
Yes, but as often happens
in my life,

18:37.120 --> 18:40.715
this gentleman is becoming
much too serious, much too fast.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.621
He's wearing that smitten look
I know so well.

18:46.538 --> 18:49.006
I've got to do something
before it goes any further.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.888
Uh-huh, I see.

18:51.164 --> 18:55.874
For the first time in my life I can't bring
myself to tell the truth to a man so...

18:56.914 --> 18:58.666
...I need a lie.

18:58.915 --> 19:01.509
And God forgive me,
I'm coming to you for help.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.077
Well, I'm flattered.

19:06.374 --> 19:10.447
All right, let me... Let me give this
a little thought here.

19:10.833 --> 19:15.190
All right. All right, I've never passed
this one on before, but I think it's--

19:15.542 --> 19:18.932
I think it's the ticket here.
It's neat, fast, clean and, best of all,

19:19.251 --> 19:22.402
it makes them want to get away
from you. Now, here's what you do.

19:22.752 --> 19:26.188
You tell him that you have
a contagious skin condition

19:26.502 --> 19:29.892
and that insanity
runs in your family.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.133
Very sensitive.

19:33.837 --> 19:36.556
Well, thank you. It's a gift.

19:37.879 --> 19:41.633
Sam, I have never been
more grateful to you than I am now.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.955
I just looked into the face
of insensitivity and dishonesty,

19:45.255 --> 19:46.608
and it made me blanch.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.590
I am going out there,
and I'm going to break up with Stuart.

19:52.006 --> 19:57.126
But I'm going to do it honestly,
straightforwardly and yet, caringly.

19:57.507 --> 20:01.580
I'll tell him the truth of my feelings, that
I'm not attracted to him romantically,

20:01.924 --> 20:04.392
although I am very attracted to him
as a friend.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.488
And I'll say it in a way that

20:08.758 --> 20:12.546
he will accept and understand
and be grateful for.

20:12.926 --> 20:15.520
Do you even begin to understand
what I'm trying to say?

20:16.510 --> 20:20.389
Everything except the part where you
changed your name to Blanche.

20:25.803 --> 20:27.634
Goodbye, Sam.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.551
Goodbye, Blanche.

20:37.179 --> 20:38.612
Thank you.

20:40.138 --> 20:41.810
- Listen, Stuart--
- Diane, I'm sorry.

20:42.055 --> 20:45.525
I can't put this off any longer.
There's something I have to tell you.

20:47.264 --> 20:49.141
Diane, for the first time in my life,

20:49.389 --> 20:52.187
I'm thinking of making a permanent
commitment with a woman.

20:53.682 --> 20:57.880
Stuart, I have a contagious skin
disease and insanity runs in my family.

21:01.641 --> 21:04.314
My God, Diane,
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

21:04.642 --> 21:06.553
Thank you.
I thought you should know.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.587
Well, that makes me feel
a little selfish,

21:10.851 --> 21:13.081
talking about my good news
after hearing that.

21:13.976 --> 21:15.614
Your good news?

21:16.477 --> 21:19.230
Diane, what I'm trying to say is...

21:19.894 --> 21:21.213
...there's someone else.

21:21.977 --> 21:24.332
She's someone I knew
before I met you.

21:24.645 --> 21:27.603
I honestly thought it was over
between us, but--

21:27.937 --> 21:32.135
Well, we spoke earlier today, and
we decided to work things through.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.380
You're telling the truth,
aren't you, Stuart?

21:41.147 --> 21:43.502
Well, that's the most
wonderful thing I ever heard.

21:45.523 --> 21:48.356
It's tearing me apart inside.

21:48.898 --> 21:51.048
I'm a total wreck.

21:51.899 --> 21:54.732
Don't give up hope, Diane.
No relationship is guaranteed.

21:55.066 --> 21:57.500
Except yours.
Don't you doubt for a moment.

21:57.816 --> 22:02.128
- We're talking ironclad here.
- Well, thank you.

22:02.525 --> 22:05.244
By the way, have you seen
a doctor about that condition of yours?

22:05.567 --> 22:06.556
What con--?

22:06.776 --> 22:09.654
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm seeing a wonderful man.

22:09.943 --> 22:11.854
He's almost
cleared it up completely.

22:12.110 --> 22:15.864
He's about got
that insanity thing licked too.

22:17.902 --> 22:20.177
He's a skin and brain man.

22:21.153 --> 22:22.666
It's a new specialty.

22:23.487 --> 22:25.876
Sounds fascinating.

22:26.195 --> 22:31.553
Well, Diane, I'm really glad we had
this chance to know each other.

22:31.988 --> 22:33.501
Me too.

22:33.780 --> 22:36.578
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Goodbye, Stuart.

22:42.073 --> 22:45.702
Hey, congratulations.
You're free and clear.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.782
Don't congratulate me.
He's a terrific guy.

22:50.157 --> 22:53.672
And I cast him aside
because of his appearance.

22:54.116 --> 22:55.629
I'm greatly ashamed.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.138
Well, from where I was sitting,
it sounded like he was--

22:58.450 --> 23:01.203
All right, Sam, let's not split hairs.

23:02.951 --> 23:04.270
The point is, he's gone.

23:04.493 --> 23:09.692
For the first time ever, I let appearance
taint my feelings toward a man.

23:10.118 --> 23:13.076
Boy, you know what's wrong with you?
You just can't be honest with yourself.

23:13.369 --> 23:16.122
Looks are all
that ever mattered to you.

23:17.911 --> 23:22.826
What are you talking about?
That is utterly inaccurate.

23:23.245 --> 23:24.758
Oh, yeah?
Want me to prove it to you?

23:25.204 --> 23:26.523
Yes.

23:27.663 --> 23:31.576
Who were you more crazy about
than anyone else in your entire life?

23:31.955 --> 23:36.028
Not including yourself there.
Don't answer. It was me.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.769
And there was only one reason
why you ever went out with me,

23:39.039 --> 23:40.313
and that was
because of my looks.

23:42.998 --> 23:45.228
- Not entirely.
- Yes, entirely.

23:45.540 --> 23:49.692
Name one other reason
why anyone would go out with me.

23:50.833 --> 23:54.348
Go on, name one.
You can't, can you?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.470
No, Sam, I can't.
