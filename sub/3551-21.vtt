WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.233
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.233 --> 00:03.674
THERE WAS FLIRTATION.

00:03.674 --> 00:07.007
HERE'S MY CARD.
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS,

00:07.007 --> 00:10.581
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME...
OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T.
 THERE WAS CONFRONTATION.

00:10.581 --> 00:13.084
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
THAT I SUPPORTED YOU,

00:13.084 --> 00:16.487
TOOK A BACKSEAT TO YOUR CAREER,
YOU COULDN'T DO THE SAME FOR ME.

00:16.487 --> 00:18.149
OH! AAH!
 THERE WAS A FIGHT.

00:18.149 --> 00:20.451
LEAVE ME ALONE!
 (door closes)

00:20.451 --> 00:21.552
(gasps)

00:21.552 --> 00:25.056
AND... THERE WERE CONSEQUENCES.

00:30.361 --> 00:34.735
(Mary Alice) SUSAN DELFINO
WAS CHARITABLE TO A FAULT.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.809
SHE JUST COULDN'T RESIST
LENDING A HAND.

00:38.809 --> 00:43.814
THERE WASN'T A LOST PET
SHE COULD IGNORE...

00:43.814 --> 00:49.150
A GIRL IN UNIFORM
SHE COULD REFUSE...

00:50.451 --> 00:54.485
OR A STRUGGLING ARTIST
SHE COULD SAY NO TO.

00:57.528 --> 01:00.631
SO WHEN IT CAME
TO A NEIGHBOR IN NEED...

01:00.631 --> 01:04.063
OH, MY GOD.
PAUL, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:04.063 --> 01:07.238
SUSAN WAS ONLY TOO EAGER
TO HELP.

01:07.238 --> 01:09.600
I STARTED HAVING
CHEST PAINS,

01:09.600 --> 01:11.542
PASSED OUT, CAME TO,
DIALED 9-1-1. (chuckles)

01:11.542 --> 01:13.544
THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING TESTS
ALL NIGHT.

01:13.544 --> 01:15.106
(sighs)

01:15.106 --> 01:18.449
WELL, I'M GONNA BE HERE FOR YOU
TILL THEY FIGURE IT OUT.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.851
I BROUGHT YOU THESE--
MAGAZINES, WATER.

01:20.851 --> 01:22.353
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

01:22.353 --> 01:24.385
I'VE GOT A STREET
FULL OF NEIGHBORS,

01:24.385 --> 01:27.388
AND THE ONLY ONE WHO COMES TO
SEE ME IS THE WOMAN I YELLED AT.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.390
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
 IT WAS MY FAULT.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.393
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU
ABOUT GETTING MY HOUSE BACK.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.625
I SOUNDED LIKE A VULTURE.

01:34.625 --> 01:37.198
MR... YOUNG,
WE'VE GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.230
COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT, SUSAN?

01:39.230 --> 01:41.232
OH, YEAH.
I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.577
WELL, GOOD NEWS.
YOUR E.K.G. CAME BACK NORMAL.

01:46.577 --> 01:49.880
SO IT'S NOT A HEART ATTACK?
 IT'S NOT A HEART ATTACK.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.243
SAYS HERE YOU'VE BEEN
EXPERIENCING DIZZINESS,

01:52.243 --> 01:55.246
NAUSEA, STOMACH CRAMPS.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

01:55.246 --> 01:58.319
I THINK UNLESS
YOU'VE BEEN POISONED

01:58.319 --> 02:01.121
OR YOU'RE PREGNANT,
IT'S PROBABLY JUST STRESS.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.324
HMM.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.226
POISONED?

02:05.226 --> 02:08.199
YEAH. I REMEMBER THIS CASE
WHEN I WAS AN INTERN.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.201
A MAN CAME IN
WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS.

02:10.201 --> 02:13.164
TURNS OUT HIS WIFE WAS PUTTING
ANTIFREEZE IN HIS OATMEAL.

02:13.164 --> 02:15.836
LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY
SO IT WASN'T OBVIOUS.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.608
BUT EVENTUALLY,
IT KILLED HIM.

02:17.608 --> 02:21.842
GOOD LESSON FOR ALL OF US--
DON'T PISS OFF THE OLD LADY.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.859
WHAT DID HE SAY?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.891
HE THINKS IT'S STRESS.

02:40.891 --> 02:43.734
JUST STRESS?

02:43.734 --> 02:47.167
THAT'S A RELIEF. (chuckles)
SO YOU MUST BE STARVING.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.540
WHAT CAN I MAKE YOU
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

02:49.540 --> 02:52.773
YES, SUSAN DELFINO
JUST COULDN'T RESIST

02:52.773 --> 02:56.247
LENDING A HAND
TO A NEIGHBOR IN TROUBLE.

02:56.247 --> 03:00.311
I'M SURE ANYTHING YOU BRING
WILL BE A HUGE HELP TO ME.
 (laughs)

03:00.311 --> 03:06.257
WHICH WAS ABOUT TO CAUSE HER
SOME TROUBLE OF HER OWN.

03:17.428 --> 03:20.231
NO MATTER HOW SECURE WE ARE,

03:20.231 --> 03:23.304
WE ALL EXPERIENCE
MOMENTS OF DREAD.

03:24.905 --> 03:30.210
IT MAY BE JUST BEFORE WE OPEN
OUR CREDIT CARD BILL...

03:30.210 --> 03:34.945
OR HAND OVER A NOTE
FROM OUR TEACHER...

03:36.947 --> 03:43.254
OR STEP ON THE SCALE
AFTER A WEEK AWAY FROM THE GYM.

03:43.254 --> 03:47.628
YES, WE ALL EXPERIENCE
MOMENTS OF DREAD,

03:47.628 --> 03:49.530
AND SOMETIMES

03:49.530 --> 03:51.862
WE HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME...
 (thunder crashing)

03:51.862 --> 03:53.964
BUT OURSELVES.

03:53.964 --> 03:55.666
AAH!

03:55.666 --> 03:57.438
(both scream)

03:57.438 --> 03:59.770
DADDY'S HOME. HOW ARE MY--

03:59.770 --> 04:01.342
(both) SHH!

04:01.342 --> 04:03.844
(growls)

04:05.476 --> 04:08.248
"BLOODY STRANGER TWO"?
SHE CAN'T WATCH THIS!

04:08.248 --> 04:10.921
DADDY, NO!

04:10.921 --> 04:13.724
LOOK, THIS IS ABOUT SOME...
STRANGER WHO COMES TO TOWN

04:13.724 --> 04:16.487
AND STARTS MURDERING
SLUTTY TEENAGERS!

04:16.487 --> 04:18.988
YEAH. IT'S A GOOD LESSON
FOR WHEN SHE'S OLDER.

04:18.988 --> 04:20.831
DON'T BE A SLUTTY TEENAGER.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.663
GABY, THIS IS WAY TOO VIOLENT.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.665
OH, THE KID'S USED TO VIOLENCE.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.668
YOU'VE SEEN ME
MAKE HER EAT CARROTS.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.800
BESIDES, JUANITA KNOWS
THE MOVIE'S FAKE.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.472
RIGHT, HONEY?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.974
DUH. THERE'S NO WAY ONE SPEARGUN

04:33.974 --> 04:36.677
COULD SHOOT THROUGH THREE HEADS
IN REAL LIFE.

04:36.677 --> 04:40.010
EXACTLY. TWO, MAYBE.
(chuckles)

04:40.010 --> 04:41.011
MAYBE.

04:41.011 --> 04:42.713
(remote control clatters)
 HEY!

04:42.713 --> 04:45.486
OH, CARLOS, RELAX.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.888
JUANITA'S TOUGH.
SHE'LL BE FINE.
 (click)

04:47.888 --> 04:49.890
♪♪♪

04:49.890 --> 04:51.291
(both) AAH!
 AAH!

04:51.291 --> 04:52.763
AAH! HE'S OUT THERE!

04:52.763 --> 04:55.996
OH!
 CALM DOWN, SWEETIE.
WHO'S OUT THERE?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.668
THE BLOODY STRANGER.

04:57.668 --> 05:00.731
HE WAS STANDING ON OUR LAWN
LOOKING AT OUR HOUSE.

05:00.731 --> 05:02.903
THE BLOODY STRANGER. NICE.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.975
NO, HONEY, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS, REMEMBER?

05:04.975 --> 05:06.777
HOW IT WAS ALL PRETEND?

05:06.777 --> 05:09.079
CAN I SLEEP IN HERE
WITH YOU GUYS?

05:09.079 --> 05:11.982
(sighs)
 YOU CAN SLEEP WITH HER.
I'M GONNA SLEEP IN YOUR BED.

05:11.982 --> 05:14.385
CELIA'S IN MY BED.

05:14.385 --> 05:16.086
THEN I'LL SLEEP IN CELIA'S BED.

05:16.086 --> 05:17.918
SHE WET HER BED.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.991
(sighs) COME ON IN.

05:25.095 --> 05:27.057
(sighs)

05:27.057 --> 05:29.660
(sighs)
 (click)

05:31.331 --> 05:33.063
(door opens)

05:33.063 --> 05:35.566
HEY!
 HEY!

05:35.566 --> 05:38.939
LOOK WHO'S HOME
IN TIME FOR DINNER!
 YEAH, WELL, I COULDN'T
MISS SPAGHETTI NIGHT.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.672
SPAGHETTI NIGHT'S TUESDAY,
DAD.

05:41.672 --> 05:44.475
YOU MADE IT HOME FOR TACO NIGHT.
 TACO NIGHT?

05:44.475 --> 05:45.976
AY, CARAMBA!

05:45.976 --> 05:47.347
OH!

05:47.347 --> 05:50.581
HEY--NO. I'M KIDDING. MWAH.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.723
HEY, YOUR MOM
MADE A LOVELY DINNER,

05:52.723 --> 05:57.428
SO THE LEAST THAT I COULD DO
WAS BRING HOME DESSERT.

05:57.428 --> 05:59.560
PLANE TICKETS?
 THAT'S RIGHT.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.694
I PLANNED THE FAMILY VACATION
THIS YEAR.
 YOU DID WHAT?

06:03.694 --> 06:04.995
SEVEN DAYS, SIX NIGHTS

06:04.995 --> 06:08.068
AT THE ROYAL KAILUA
SPA AND RESORT

06:08.068 --> 06:09.940
IN... HAWAII.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.072
WHOO!
 DAD!

06:12.072 --> 06:14.545
WELL DONE, SIR!
 (Penny) I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE!

06:14.545 --> 06:17.478
YOU BOUGHT THE TICKETS
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.979
OKAY. NOT EXACTLY

06:18.979 --> 06:22.012
"WOW, TOM, YOU'RE THE GREATEST
HUSBAND IN THE WORLD."

06:22.012 --> 06:24.715
BUT I TOLD YOU, I ALREADY
PLANNED OUR VACATION,

06:24.715 --> 06:28.018
JUST LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING
FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.020
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
YOU DESERVE A YEAR OFF.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.722
(lowered voice)
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

06:31.722 --> 06:34.425
THE WATERSLIDES
AT THIS PLACE.
 (Penny) COOL!

06:34.425 --> 06:39.399
YEAH. YEAH, COOL.
EXCEPT I JUST SPENT TWO WEEKS

06:39.399 --> 06:41.101
MAPPING OUT A ROUTE
FOR A CAMPING TRIP,

06:41.101 --> 06:45.105
AND I PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN
ON AN R.V.
 OKAY, SO WE EAT THE DEPOSIT.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.608
WISH I COULD EAT IT RIGHT NOW.
 (laughter)

06:47.608 --> 06:51.942
(crunch)
 AND I TOLD MY SISTER WE'D
STOP BY AND VISIT ON THE WAY.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.448
WE GET BACK FROM HAWAII,

06:57.448 --> 06:59.720
WE FLY HER OUT
TO SEE US HERE--

06:59.720 --> 07:02.723
BOOM! PROBLEM SOLVED.
 (children cheer)

07:02.723 --> 07:04.655
(laughter)

07:04.655 --> 07:05.956
AND YET STILL NO

07:05.956 --> 07:09.129
"YOU'RE THE GREATEST HUSBAND
IN THE WORLD"?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.762
UH...

07:11.762 --> 07:13.433
OH, MY GOD.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.936
FIRST CLASS?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.108
YOU ARE THE GREATEST HUSBAND
IN THE WORLD!
 (children cheering)

07:18.108 --> 07:21.111
(Penny) AAH! OH, MY GOD!
WE'RE GOING TO HAWAII! AAH!

07:21.111 --> 07:23.944
YES! SO LUCKY!
 OHH.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.716
YEAH.
 (laughter)

07:25.716 --> 07:27.147
HAWAII.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.953
(bell rings,
children shouting playfully)

07:32.953 --> 07:35.125
PRINCIPAL HOBSON!
 (door closes)

07:37.057 --> 07:39.760
PRINCIPAL HOBSON?

07:39.760 --> 07:43.033
PRINCIPAL HOBSON! (sighs)

07:43.033 --> 07:46.737
UH--SUSAN! HEY! (chuckles)
GREAT TO SEE YOU!

07:46.737 --> 07:49.640
DID YOU GET MY E-MAILS?
I SENT YOU, LIKE, TEN.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.142
E-MAILS? NO.

07:52.142 --> 07:56.476
OH. WELL, IN THE FIRST ONE--
 ALL RIGHT. I GOT THEM.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.109
AND I WOULD BE GLAD
TO GIVE YOU YOUR JOB BACK,

07:59.109 --> 08:02.152
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT JUST ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
 OH...

08:02.152 --> 08:03.954
WHY NOT?

08:03.954 --> 08:06.957
SUSAN, YOU CAN'T BE SURPRISED
THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

08:06.957 --> 08:10.591
WHEN YOU SHOW UP ON THE INTERNET
HOLDING A FEATHER DUSTER

08:10.591 --> 08:12.222
AND WEARING A PURPLE BRA?

08:12.222 --> 08:14.494
THAT WAS VERY SPECIFIC.

08:14.494 --> 08:20.030
WELL, I-I HAD TO VERIFY
THE CLAIMS IN ORDER TO--

08:20.030 --> 08:23.073
MY POINT IS,
THE DAMAGE WAS DONE.

08:23.073 --> 08:25.676
I KNOW. I MADE A MISTAKE.

08:25.676 --> 08:28.208
BUT I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE
A SECOND CHANCE.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.211
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I WOULD GIVE YOU THAT CHANCE.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.783
BUT YOU KNOW
PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

08:32.783 --> 08:35.546
THE PARENTS' COUNCIL
HAS ALL THE POWER.

08:35.546 --> 08:37.988
SO... IF I WERE
TO WIN THEM OVER...

08:37.988 --> 08:40.150
WELL, IT WOULD BE A START.

08:40.150 --> 08:43.222
THANK YOU.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.125
OH, AND I PROMISE,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.197
NO FEATHER DUSTER,
NO PURPLE BRA. (chuckles)

08:47.197 --> 08:49.760
AND NO BLACK BUSTIER.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.061
(laughs)

08:51.061 --> 08:54.304
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.239
(lock clicks)

08:59.239 --> 09:01.211
(sighs)

09:01.211 --> 09:03.073
(car door closes)

09:03.073 --> 09:06.847
OH, DETECTIVE VANCE.
I WAS JUST, UM, HEADING OUT.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.549
I WON'T KEEP YOU. I JUST STOPPED
BY TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CARD,

09:09.549 --> 09:12.282
TO REPLACE THE ONE YOU LOST.
 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I LOST IT?

09:12.282 --> 09:15.826
I GAVE IT TO YOU TWO DAYS AGO.
YOU NEVER CALLED ME,

09:15.826 --> 09:18.128
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU LOST IT.
 NO. I DIDN'T.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.630
NOW, IS THAT NICE?

09:19.630 --> 09:22.092
I GIVE YOU A GRACEFUL WAY
TO SPARE MY FEELINGS,

09:22.092 --> 09:24.094
AND YOU CLOBBER ME
WITH FACTS.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.196
YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT?

09:26.196 --> 09:30.601
QUITE SURE. IN FACT,
IT'S RIGHT HERE IN MY PURSE.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.603
YOU DIDN'T THROW IT AWAY.

09:32.603 --> 09:34.905
THAT MUST MEAN
YOU WERE THINKING OF CALLING.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.977
LOOK... (sighs)

09:36.977 --> 09:39.610
THIS IS MY SECOND TRY.
I CAN'T ASK YOU AGAIN.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.182
IS THAT AN ULTIMATUM?
 IT'S A FACT OF COURTSHIP--

09:42.182 --> 09:45.856
TWICE IS CHARMINGLY PERSISTENT.
ONCE MORE AND I'M STALKING YOU.

09:45.856 --> 09:49.920
SO YOU'RE COURTING ME?
 I'M TRYING TO. WHEN WILL YOU
STOP PLAYING HARD TO GET?

09:49.920 --> 09:52.092
MAYBE WHEN YOU STOP
PLAYING HARD TO WANT.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.595
YOU SEE HOW MUCH YOU ENJOY
SMACKING ME DOWN?
 MM.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.598
WHY PASS UP A CHANCE
TO DO IT ALL NIGHT?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.171
COME ON. ONE DINNER.

10:04.134 --> 10:07.978
FINE. THIS THURSDAY,
8:00 P.M.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.110
GREAT. SEE YOU THEN.

10:12.242 --> 10:14.745
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HEADING OUT.

10:17.087 --> 10:18.919
RIGHT.

10:23.053 --> 10:24.354
(bottles clink)

10:25.996 --> 10:27.127
(door closes)

10:27.127 --> 10:29.930
(plastic crinkles)

10:32.833 --> 10:36.236
YOU... WANT ME TO TEST
A TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.338
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.340
WELL,
NORMALLY WE TEST STUFF

10:40.340 --> 10:42.342
LIKE SOIL SAMPLES
AND GROUND WATER,

10:42.342 --> 10:45.345
BUT SURE, I CAN DO IT.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

10:47.177 --> 10:49.279
ANTIFREEZE.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.033
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TONIGHT?

11:03.033 --> 11:06.436
A FRIEND OF MINE'S
PLAYING AT A JAZZ CLUB.
 OH, THANKS, RENEE,
BUT I HAVE A DATE.

11:06.436 --> 11:09.069
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME,
JUST SAY SO.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.272
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE STUFF UP.
 NO! I REALLY DO HAVE A DATE.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.905
IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?
 UH, SLIGHTLY.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.206
SO WHO IS HE?

11:16.206 --> 11:19.309
HE'S A DETECTIVE.
HIS NAME IS CHUCK.

11:19.309 --> 11:21.852
CHUCK VANCE.

11:21.852 --> 11:24.154
WELL, DON'T STOP.
I WANT TO HEAR IT ALL.

11:24.154 --> 11:28.418
ACTUALLY, THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
 THAT'S IT? AND YOU AGREED
TO GO OUT WITH HIM?

11:28.418 --> 11:30.761
(sighs) I NEVER DATE A GUY

11:30.761 --> 11:33.123
UNTIL I'VE DONE
A COMPLETE BACKGROUND CHECK.

11:33.123 --> 11:35.425
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
GOOGLE HIM.
 AMATEUR.

11:35.425 --> 11:38.228
GIVE ME HIS NAME AND I WILL FIND
OUT EVERYTHING WORTH KNOWING--

11:38.228 --> 11:41.932
MARITAL HISTORY, NET WORTH,
RESULTS OF HIS LAST PHYSICAL.

11:41.932 --> 11:43.233
THE PHYSICAL
SEEMS EXCESSIVE.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.235
(sighs)
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT

11:45.235 --> 11:49.279
TILL I SPENT A WEEKEND PINNED
UNDER A DEAD LINEBACKER.

11:49.279 --> 11:51.912
MM.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.914
(coffee pours)
 WHY WOULD YOU LET HER WATCH

11:53.914 --> 11:56.246
SOMETHING CALLED
"BLOODY STRANGER TWO"?

11:56.246 --> 11:59.189
I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M AN IDIOT.
NOW SHE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES

11:59.189 --> 12:02.152
AND CRAWLING INTO OUR BED
EVERY NIGHT.
 WHEN I WAS A KID,
I HAD BAD DREAMS

12:02.152 --> 12:04.454
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE--
JUMPING-OUT-OF-BED,

12:04.454 --> 12:06.456
RUNNING-DOWN-THE-HALL-SCREAMING
KIND OF DREAMS.

12:06.456 --> 12:09.059
SO WHAT'D YOU DO?
 GUESS I OUTGREW 'EM.

12:09.059 --> 12:10.761
(spoon clinking)
 YOU DID?

12:10.761 --> 12:11.862
MM.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.163
JUANITA, COME HERE!

12:13.163 --> 12:16.206
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I FIGURED
YOU COULD TALK TO HER.

12:16.206 --> 12:19.209
YOU KNOW, GIVE HER ONE OF
THOSE "IT GETS BETTER" SPEECHES

12:19.209 --> 12:22.112
YOU GAYS LOVE SO MUCH.
 (door opens)

12:22.112 --> 12:26.146
SWEETIE,
LEE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.148
SO YOUR MOM SAYS
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING NIGHTMARES.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.479
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT?

12:29.479 --> 12:32.222
I SEE THIS CREEPY GUY
STANDING ON OUR LAWN.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.523
OH, YOU POOR THING.

12:33.523 --> 12:36.957
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I HAD NIGHTMARES, TOO.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.990
REALLY?
 YEAH.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.292
MY BROTHER TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS A HOSPITAL

12:42.292 --> 12:45.165
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.367
AND AT NIGHT,
THE INMATES WOULD ESCAPE

12:47.367 --> 12:50.040
AND KIDNAP
LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.273
BUT IT'S NOT REAL. HIS BROTHER
WAS JUST TRYING TO SCARE HIM.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.305
OH, NO.
IT WAS TOTALLY REAL.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.477
ONE SUMMER,
THREE KIDS WENT MISSING.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.349
UNTIL THEY FOUND THEM...
 RIGHT.

12:59.349 --> 13:03.053
ABOUT A MONTH LATER...
IN A RAVINE.

13:03.053 --> 13:05.085
ALIVE!

13:05.085 --> 13:07.157
NO. COME ON.
THEY WERE IN A RAVINE.

13:07.157 --> 13:10.020
WHAT GOOD EVER
COMES OUT OF A RAVINE?

13:10.020 --> 13:11.221
(whimpers)

13:11.221 --> 13:13.223
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

13:13.223 --> 13:16.166
I'M JUST SHOWING HER THERE'S
NOTHING TO BE FRIGHTENED OF.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.168
MY STORY'S WAY SCARIER
THAN HERS.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.870
(sighs)

13:21.201 --> 13:24.204
OKAY. SO CINDY'S IN CHARGE
OF DECORATIONS,

13:24.204 --> 13:26.837
ABBY, YOU'RE HANDLING MUSIC...
 (door creaks)

13:26.837 --> 13:31.281
OH, SORRY. SORRY. DON'T LET ME
INTERRUPT. (chuckles)

13:45.926 --> 13:48.959
(sighs)

13:48.959 --> 13:51.131
SUSAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:51.131 --> 13:54.134
I HEARD YOU GUYS WERE PLANNING
AN OPEN HOUSE NIGHT,

13:54.134 --> 13:56.566
AND I'D LOVE TO PITCH IN.
HOW CAN I HELP?

13:56.566 --> 13:59.239
LET'S SEE. YOU'RE LEGENDARY
FOR YOUR CLEANING ABILITIES.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.111
(scattered laughter)

14:01.111 --> 14:03.273
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

14:03.273 --> 14:06.046
DO YOU NEED ANY REFRESHMENTS?
I COULD MAKE SOMETHING.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.518
THANKS, BUT IF WE NEED
ANY HELP, WE'LL CALL YOU.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.580
IS IT STILL 99 CENTS A MINUTE?

14:10.580 --> 14:13.323
(laughter continues)
 OKAY, UH...

14:13.323 --> 14:16.156
LOOKS LIKE WE SHOULD JUST
GET THIS OUT THERE.

14:16.156 --> 14:20.260
MY FAMILY HAD
A REALLY CRAPPY YEAR.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.064
UH, I DID SOME THINGS
THAT I AM NOT PROUD OF.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.940
BUT I WAS A DAMN GOOD TEACHER
WHEN I WAS AT THIS SCHOOL.

14:29.940 --> 14:34.044
AND I WAS HOPING THAT
YOU LADIES MIGHT EVENTUALLY

14:34.044 --> 14:36.506
SUPPORT HIRING ME BACK.

14:36.506 --> 14:39.609
YOU WANT TO TEACH
HERE AGAIN?

14:39.609 --> 14:41.351
I THINK THE PARENTS' COUNCIL

14:41.351 --> 14:43.483
MIGHT HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.487
LOOK, I-I'M NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS--

14:47.487 --> 14:50.560
JUST A CHANCE TO EARN IT.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.293
LET ME DO SOMETHING
FOR OPEN HOUSE.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.566
I REALLY DO WANNA HELP.

14:56.566 --> 14:59.469
OKAY. HOW ABOUT
YOU PICK UP THE STREAMERS?

14:59.469 --> 15:01.201
STREAMERS?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.673
IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

15:03.673 --> 15:07.307
JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO
CONFUSE THEM WITH TASSELS.
 (scattered laughter)

15:07.307 --> 15:09.179
MEETING ADJOURNED.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.516
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT THIS.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.148
IT FEELS LIKE
SUCH AN INTRUSION.

15:18.148 --> 15:20.190
AND BESIDES,
HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.922
THEN I'M JUST
IN THE NICK OF TIME.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.624
YOU FOUND SOMETHING BAD?

15:24.624 --> 15:28.158
WELL, FOR ME, HIS SALARY ALONE
MAKES HIM A NON-STARTER.

15:28.158 --> 15:31.401
BUT YOU MAY BE MORE INTERESTED
IN WHAT'S ON PAGE THREE.

15:31.401 --> 15:34.934
IS HE A DIRTY COP?
OR A DEMOCRAT?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.037
WORSE.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.568
(sighs)

15:40.370 --> 15:43.143
(mutters indistinctly)

15:43.143 --> 15:44.944
(gasps)

15:46.146 --> 15:48.218
(doorbell rings)

15:53.653 --> 15:55.555
HELLO, CHUCK.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.258
I WAS AFRAID I WAS EARLY,
BUT, UH...

15:58.258 --> 16:00.260
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ALL READY.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.732
OH, I'M READY, ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.043
(indistinct conversations)

16:13.043 --> 16:15.045
HOPE THIS IS OKAY.
YOU LIKE ITALIAN, RIGHT?

16:15.045 --> 16:16.346
EVERYBODY LIKES ITALIAN.

16:16.346 --> 16:19.679
OH, IT'S FINE. (chuckles)
SO LET'S TALK.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.183
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.715
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW?

16:25.715 --> 16:29.359
OH, WHATEVER YOU THINK IS,
HMM... PERTINENT.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.321
OKAY. UM, I WAS BORN
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

16:31.321 --> 16:34.324
I PLAYED SOME BALL
IN COLLEGE.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.626
UM, I HAVE A DEGREE--
CRIMINOLOGY.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.369
INTERESTING.

16:41.031 --> 16:42.302
ANYTHING ELSE?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.704
WELL, I HAVE TWO KIDS.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.476
OH. SO YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.478
YEAH. DIDN'T WORK OUT.

16:48.478 --> 16:51.681
I HOPE YOU DON'T
JUDGE ME FOR THAT.

16:51.681 --> 16:54.144
OH, NO. NOT FOR THAT.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.316
IS SOMETHING WRONG, BREE?

16:56.316 --> 16:59.319
I'M JUST WONDERING WHEN
YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME

16:59.319 --> 17:02.252
THAT YOU'RE STILL MARRIED.

17:02.252 --> 17:05.055
(sighs) I SEE YOU'VE DONE
DUE DILIGENCE.

17:05.055 --> 17:07.057
DID YOUR SOURCE
HAPPEN TO MENTION

17:07.057 --> 17:09.098
THAT I FILED FOR DIVORCE
LAST SPRING?

17:09.098 --> 17:11.101
AND THAT IT HASN'T
GONE THROUGH,

17:11.101 --> 17:13.103
SO TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE STILL MARRIED.

17:13.103 --> 17:15.464
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
 WE HAVEN'T EVEN ORDERED YET.

17:15.464 --> 17:17.467
YOU EXPECT ME
TO LEAD WITH THAT?

17:17.467 --> 17:19.638
"HEY, I'M TECHNICALLY MARRIED.
THE CHICKEN LOOKS GOOD."

17:19.638 --> 17:22.642
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DATING AT ALL
UNTIL YOUR DIVORCE IS FINAL.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.444
WHAT IF YOU
AND YOUR WIFE RECONCILE?
 I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO MY WIFE

17:25.444 --> 17:28.318
IN A YEAR
WITHOUT MY LAWYER PRESENT.

17:28.318 --> 17:31.151
YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR DOING
A SIMPLE BACKGROUND CHECK.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.284
HELL, NO. I'M SURE YOU WANT
TO AVOID ANOTHER MISTAKE

17:34.284 --> 17:37.227
LIKE YOUR SECOND HUSBAND,
THE HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.259
ORSON, WAS IT?

17:39.259 --> 17:40.760
WHAT?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.763
TELL ME, WHO WAS CREEPIER--
HIM OR THAT PHARMACIST

17:43.763 --> 17:46.396
WHO KILLED HIMSELF
WHILE YOU WERE DATING?

17:46.396 --> 17:49.569
(laughs)
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.571
I PULLED YOUR POLICE FILE.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.374
I HAVE A FILE?

17:54.374 --> 17:57.347
AND YOU PULLED IT.

17:57.347 --> 18:00.110
HOW DARE YOU INVESTIGATE ME
BEFORE OUR DATE!

18:00.110 --> 18:03.383
SAY THAT AGAIN, AND THIS TIME,
LISTEN FOR THE IRONY.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.485
THERE IS NO COMPARISON
TO WHAT I DID.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.188
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS!
I HAVE TO PROTECT MYSELF.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.120
OH, WOMEN
CAN BE DANGEROUS, TOO,

18:10.120 --> 18:12.292
ESPECIALLY ONES WHO OWN
FOUR HANDGUNS

18:12.292 --> 18:14.694
AND A .30-06 HUNTING RIFLE.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.396
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.398
YOU ARE TREATING ME
LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL!

18:18.398 --> 18:20.470
WHAT CAN I GET YOU FOLKS
TO START?

18:20.470 --> 18:24.374
I WILL NOT BE ORDERING.
I WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.337
COME ON, BREE. CALM DOWN.
HAVE A DRINK.

18:27.337 --> 18:29.839
I DON'T DRINK.
WASN'T THAT IN MY FILE?

18:29.839 --> 18:32.212
(singsongy)
SOMEONE'S SLIPPING.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.121
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.624
HMM? (kisses)
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.226
I THINK
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME,

18:46.226 --> 18:50.660
MUCH AS I DID WHEN I PLANNED
THIS YEAR'S VACATION.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.562
WE SHOULD HAVE
DISCUSSED THIS.

18:52.562 --> 18:54.834
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.836
I WASN'T SURPRISED.
I WAS BLINDSIDED.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.838
YOU MAY CALL ALL THE SHOTS
AT WORK,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.611
BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE C.F.O. OF THIS FAMILY.

19:01.611 --> 19:04.344
UGH.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.715
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:07.377 --> 19:11.421
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
YOUR ROAD TRIP SOUNDS AMAZING.

19:11.421 --> 19:15.785
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
PAN OUT FOR THIS SUMMER.

19:15.785 --> 19:19.329
BUT YOU MADE A HELL OF A GREAT
START FOR NEXT YEAR'S TRIP.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.293
DON'T PULL THAT
MANAGEMENT TRICK ON ME.

19:23.293 --> 19:25.665
WHAT TRICK?
 THE "YES" SANDWICH.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.367
START WITH A COMPLIMENT,
LOWER THE BOOM,

19:27.367 --> 19:30.600
END WITH A COMPLIMENT. IT'S
THE OLDEST TRICK IN BUSINESS,

19:30.600 --> 19:34.204
AND I TAUGHT IT TO YOU.
 LYNETTE, I ALREADY PROMISED
HAWAII TO THE KIDS.

19:34.204 --> 19:37.447
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT AWAY?
YOU SAW HOW EXCITED THEY WERE.

19:37.447 --> 19:40.280
ONLY BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER
HAD A LAVISH VACATION BEFORE.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.282
GIVE ME THE SAME BUDGET,
AND I'LL MAKE MY TRIP

19:42.282 --> 19:46.185
SOUND TWICE AS GOOD AS YOURS.
 OH, I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU TRY.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
(laughs)

19:48.187 --> 19:50.720
OKAY, THEN. GAME ON.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.863
WE'LL, UM,
WE'LL SIT THE KIDS DOWN,

19:53.863 --> 19:56.566
WE'LL EACH MAKE OUR
PRESENTATION. LET THEM DECIDE.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.568
SOUNDS FAIR TO ME.
GAME ON.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.800
OKAY. GAME ON.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.201
(click)

20:02.201 --> 20:04.404
UH...

20:04.404 --> 20:06.976
HONEY.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.483
I'M NOT TURNED ON.
YOU'RE A VERY HANDSOME MAN.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.515
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SEX.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.417
THAT'S A "NO" SANDWICH.

20:27.757 --> 20:32.302
LEVEL WITH ME, BREE. DO I STILL
HAVE A CHANCE WITH YOU?
 NONE WHATSOEVER.

20:32.302 --> 20:34.764
THEN THIS CAN'T MAKE THINGS
ANY WORSE.

20:34.764 --> 20:36.336
(tires screech)

20:36.336 --> 20:39.739
(horn honks)

20:39.739 --> 20:42.241
THAT'S RIGHT.
KEEP DRIVING, BUDDY.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.355
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
 GET IN, VIOLET.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.626
(sighs)

20:56.626 --> 20:59.289
(door opens)
 OH, MY GOD. YOU COULDN'T
HAVE DROPPED ME OFF

20:59.289 --> 21:01.491
BEFORE YOU PICK UP
A PROSTITUTE?

21:01.491 --> 21:02.592
(door closes)

21:05.395 --> 21:07.497
YOU ARRESTING ME, CHUCK?

21:07.497 --> 21:10.400
JUST TAKING YOU
TO THE WOMEN'S SHELTER.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.403
SO WHAT IS THIS,
YOUR GOOD DEED FOR THE NIGHT?

21:13.403 --> 21:15.845
YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS YOUR DATE?

21:15.845 --> 21:19.008
NO. THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.
SHE HATES ME MORE THAN YOU DO.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.481
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

21:21.481 --> 21:24.914
MY OPINION ISN'T ANY
OF YOUR CONCERN, MISS.

21:24.914 --> 21:26.916
YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HER,
CHUCK.

21:26.916 --> 21:29.759
(singsongy) THIS ONE'S GOT
A STICK UP HER ASS.

21:29.759 --> 21:32.462
AND WHAT QUALIFIES YOU TO MAKE
SUCH SNAP JUDGMENTS

21:32.462 --> 21:36.596
ABOUT PEOPLE YOU'VE JUST MET?
 I'M A HOOKER. IT'S WHAT I DO.

21:38.398 --> 21:41.070
(sighs)

21:46.876 --> 21:48.678
(gears shift, engine turns off)

21:48.678 --> 21:52.482
HERE WE ARE, AND I'M WATCHING
TO MAKE SURE YOU GO IN.

21:52.482 --> 21:56.546
YOU KNOW I'M JUST GONNA BE BACK
ON THAT CORNER TOMORROW.
 YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S TOMORROW'S PROBLEM.

21:56.546 --> 21:58.548
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GIVE UP?

21:58.548 --> 22:02.051
WHAT I AM NOW...
THAT'S ALL I'M EVER GONNA BE.

22:04.654 --> 22:06.356
YOU THINK SO?

22:09.599 --> 22:11.601
DID YOU KNOW
THAT TEN YEARS AGO,

22:11.601 --> 22:15.004
BREE HERE WAS TURNING TRICKS
JUST LIKE YOU?

22:16.466 --> 22:18.107
(whispers) HOW DARE YOU.

22:18.107 --> 22:20.370
BREE,
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.

22:22.011 --> 22:24.914
I MUST HAVE HAULED
HER ASS IN 50 TIMES.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.849
THEN ONE DAY, SHE SAID,
"I'M BETTER THAN THIS."

22:29.849 --> 22:32.121
SHE GOT HERSELF TO SCHOOL.

22:32.121 --> 22:35.124
BEFORE YOU KNEW IT, SHE HAD
A FIRST CLASS CATERING COMPANY,

22:35.124 --> 22:37.026
SO DON'T TRY TO TELL ME

22:37.026 --> 22:39.859
THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE
A BETTER LIFE FOR YOURSELF.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.734
YOU WERE REALLY ON THE STREET?

22:44.734 --> 22:46.436
ACTUALLY, I...

22:52.542 --> 22:56.406
I DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT PART OF MY LIFE.

22:56.406 --> 22:59.409
I GET IT.

22:59.409 --> 23:01.411
(sighs) LOOK AT YOU NOW, HUH?

23:03.553 --> 23:06.756
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:06.756 --> 23:08.418
LIKEWISE.
 (door opens)

23:08.418 --> 23:09.919
THANK YOU, CHUCK.

23:09.919 --> 23:11.621
DON'T MENTION IT.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.466
(door closes)

23:16.466 --> 23:20.430
I KNOW. WAY OUTTA LINE.

23:20.430 --> 23:23.903
YOU SAID I HAD NO CHANCE,
SO I FIGURED, WHAT THE HELL.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.805
HOME?

23:27.677 --> 23:29.108
YES, PLEASE.

23:32.181 --> 23:33.883
(inhales deeply)

23:33.883 --> 23:35.845
(engine starts)

23:44.123 --> 23:46.996
YOU WERE RIGHT. FOUND TRACE
AMOUNTS OF ANTIFREEZE,

23:46.996 --> 23:49.599
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED YOU.

23:49.599 --> 23:51.100
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

23:51.100 --> 23:54.464
IF I ATE ONE OF THESE CASSEROLES
EVERY DAY?

23:54.464 --> 23:57.567
WELL, FOR ONE THING, YOU'D GET
TIRED OF TUNA CASSEROLE.

23:57.567 --> 23:58.868
(chuckles)

23:58.868 --> 24:01.170
AHEM. IF YOU REPEATEDLY
CONSUMED ETHYLENE GLYCOL,

24:01.170 --> 24:03.172
YOUR HEART WOULD START
TO FAIL,

24:03.172 --> 24:06.846
YOUR KIDNEYS WOULD GIVE OUT.
EVENTUALLY, YOU'D DIE.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.918
IT'D BE A NASTY WAY TO GO.

24:08.918 --> 24:11.621
HUH.

24:11.621 --> 24:13.923
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

24:13.923 --> 24:16.926
(rustling)

24:21.761 --> 24:24.163
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:24.163 --> 24:27.166
I THOUGHT I WAS BORROWING
LYNETTE'S TENT.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.540
TURNS OUT I BORROWED
A NYLON BAG OF DEATH.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.502
WHY ARE YOU SETTING UP
THE TENT?

24:32.502 --> 24:34.504
FOR JUANITA.
I WANNA PROVE TO HER

24:34.504 --> 24:36.145
THERE'S NO SCARY GUY
ON THE LAWN.

24:36.145 --> 24:39.148
I FIGURED IF SHE SPENDS
THE NIGHT CAMPING OUT HERE,

24:39.148 --> 24:40.850
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

24:40.850 --> 24:42.612
SO THE KID IS SCARED

24:42.612 --> 24:44.684
THERE'S A KILLER
LURKING OUTSIDE AT NIGHT,

24:44.684 --> 24:48.157
AND YOUR SOLUTION IS
TO MAKE HER SLEEP OUT HERE?
 NOT ALONE, YOU DOPE.
YOU'LL BE WITH HER.

24:48.157 --> 24:49.158
ME?

24:49.158 --> 24:51.160
(sighs) YEAH.
WHAT IF SHE'S RIGHT?

24:51.160 --> 24:53.863
WHAT IF THERE IS A KILLER...
OR IT'S COLD?

24:53.863 --> 24:56.165
OH. (chuckles) FORGET IT.

24:56.165 --> 24:59.168
I GOT AN EARLY MEETING TOMORROW,
AND I'M NOT GOING IN HALF ASLEEP

24:59.168 --> 25:01.170
BECAUSE I SLEPT ON MY LAWN.

25:01.170 --> 25:03.733
YOU CAUSED THIS PROBLEM.
YOU FIX IT, TONIGHT.

25:03.733 --> 25:06.906
AND STOP POUTING.
IT'S FUN TO SLEEP OUTSIDE.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.208
I'M SURE IT IS.

25:09.208 --> 25:13.783
THAT MUST BE WHY THE HOMELESS
ARE ALWAYS SO CHEERY!

25:17.216 --> 25:18.718
(knocks on door)

25:18.718 --> 25:21.551
COME IN.

25:21.551 --> 25:22.521
HEY.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.625
AFTER OUR DATE--
OR RATHER, NON-DATE--

25:25.625 --> 25:27.597
I WAS VERY CONFUSED.

25:27.597 --> 25:29.528
MAKES TWO OF US.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.531
I WAS... OFFENDED WHEN
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE TRUTH

25:32.531 --> 25:34.533
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE
AND ODDLY TOUCHED

25:34.533 --> 25:36.535
WHEN YOU TOLD
A COMPLETE STRANGER

25:36.535 --> 25:38.568
I WAS A WHORE.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.570
WELL, IF YOU LIKE THAT,

25:40.570 --> 25:42.572
YOU SHOULD WAIT
TILL VALENTINE'S DAY.

25:42.572 --> 25:44.574
I WANTED TO KNOW
YOUR SECRETS RIGHT AWAY,

25:44.574 --> 25:46.576
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO
TELL YOU MINE

25:46.576 --> 25:49.148
UNTIL I FELT I COULD TRUST YOU,

25:49.148 --> 25:52.551
AND THAT... WASN'T FAIR.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.124
I WAS NO BETTER.

25:55.124 --> 25:57.126
WHEN DID DATING
BECOME SO COMPLICATED?

25:57.126 --> 25:59.629
WE'RE NOT KIDS ANYMORE.

25:59.629 --> 26:04.333
WE'VE BOTH HAD OUR HEARTS
KICKED AROUND.

26:04.333 --> 26:07.937
I GUESS IT'S MADE US
A LITTLE GUN-SHY...

26:07.937 --> 26:10.239
IF "GUN-SHY" IS THE RIGHT WORD
FOR A WOMAN

26:10.239 --> 26:13.102
WITH AN ARSENAL
AS BIG AS YOURS.

26:15.044 --> 26:17.677
(whispers)
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

26:17.677 --> 26:20.349
I SAY...

26:20.349 --> 26:22.852
WE FORGET ABOUT
THE CRAZY DIGGING FOR DIRT

26:22.852 --> 26:24.313
THAT WE BOTH DID

26:24.313 --> 26:27.156
AND JUST HAVE
A NORMAL FIRST DATE.

26:27.156 --> 26:29.789
ALL RIGHT.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.220
WHEN?

26:31.220 --> 26:33.092
WELL, IT IS LUNCHTIME.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.294
WHY NOT?

26:35.294 --> 26:38.227
I KNOW THIS LITTLE INDIAN PLACE

26:38.227 --> 26:40.329
THAT DOES
AN AMAZING LAMB VINDALOO.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.331
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I LIKE INDIAN FOOD?

26:42.331 --> 26:44.203
I'D RATHER NOT SAY.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.707
(sighs)

26:47.707 --> 26:52.181
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I WANNA
WORK AT THAT SCHOOL AGAIN.

26:52.181 --> 26:54.183
UGH, THOSE SMUG CLIQUEY MOMS.

26:54.183 --> 26:57.346
I MEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
DANA GAVE ME STREAMER DUTY?

26:57.346 --> 27:00.389
IT'S POSITIVELY AWFUL.

27:00.389 --> 27:03.352
SO TELL ME, HOW IS PAUL?

27:03.352 --> 27:06.055
I HEAR HE WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL?

27:06.055 --> 27:08.057
HE THOUGHT HE WAS HAVING
A HEART ATTACK,

27:08.057 --> 27:10.259
BUT THE TEST RESULTS
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

27:10.259 --> 27:12.331
DO THE DOCTORS KNOW
WHAT CAUSED IT?

27:12.331 --> 27:14.033
THEY THINK IT'S STRESS,

27:14.033 --> 27:16.065
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

27:16.065 --> 27:17.907
OH, DON'T BE.

27:17.907 --> 27:21.370
WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD GO BACK
AND HAVE MORE TESTS DONE.

27:21.370 --> 27:23.072
HE'LL BE FINE.

27:23.072 --> 27:25.074
AS A NURSE,
I SAW TIME AND AGAIN

27:25.074 --> 27:27.076
THAT THE BEST PRESCRIPTION
FOR STRESS

27:27.076 --> 27:29.779
IS REST AND GOOD FOOD.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.884
SO SWEET OF YOU TO MAKE
THESE COOKIES FOR HIM.

27:34.884 --> 27:36.886
WELL, YEAH, I HOPE
IT CHEERS HIM UP.

27:36.886 --> 27:40.289
I'M SURE IT'S JUST
WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.334
(liquid splashes, cap clicks)

27:45.334 --> 27:50.239
WELL...
I WISH I COULD DO MORE.

27:50.239 --> 27:52.071
OH, SUSAN.

27:52.071 --> 27:56.445
YOU'RE DOING MORE FOR PAUL
THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY KNOW.

28:08.758 --> 28:10.920
THE GRAND CANYON.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.261
OVER A MILE DEEP.

28:12.261 --> 28:17.296
IT TOOK SIX MILLION YEARS
TO FORM.

28:19.969 --> 28:22.872
SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST--

28:22.872 --> 28:26.035
A SOARING MONUMENT
TO NATURE'S MAJESTY.

28:26.035 --> 28:27.336
SO THAT'S OUR VACATION?

28:27.336 --> 28:30.309
(chuckles) LOOKING AT TREES
AND A HOLE IN THE GROUND?

28:30.309 --> 28:35.044
NOW, NOW, KIDS, YOUR MOM
WORKED HARD ON THIS. BE KIND.

28:35.044 --> 28:39.018
YEAH. YEAH, IF THE GRAND CANYON
ISN'T YOUR SCENE...

28:39.018 --> 28:41.220
DID SHE SAY "SCENE"?

28:41.220 --> 28:44.293
YOU'RE BOUND TO LOVE
OUR NEXT STOP...

28:44.293 --> 28:46.826
THE SCREAMINATOR.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.429
SEVEN MINUTES
OF SHEER ROLLER COASTER TERROR.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.962
"RESPONSIBLE PARENTING" MAGAZINE

28:52.962 --> 28:57.306
CALLS IT THE WORST IDEA
SINCE THE CAFFEINATED JUICE BOX.

28:57.306 --> 28:58.968
THAT'S AWESOME.
 OOH.

28:58.968 --> 29:01.270
THAT SOUNDS REALLY...
 (Preston) OH, ME LIKEY THAT.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.312
(Parker) THAT'S VERY SWEET!
 ANY AND ALL

29:03.312 --> 29:06.215
OF THESE THRILLING DESTINATIONS
ARE AVAILABLE TO US.

29:06.215 --> 29:09.248
WE JUST POINT THE R.V...
(whispers) AND DRIVE.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.980
(Parker) ALL RIGHT!
 (Preston) WHOO!

29:10.980 --> 29:12.982
YES!
 OH, MAN, I CAN'T WAIT.

29:12.982 --> 29:14.984
OOH, I FORGET ABOUT THE R.V.

29:14.984 --> 29:17.987
WON'T IT BE A LITTLE CRAMPED
NOW THAT WE HAVE PAIGE?

29:17.987 --> 29:21.060
OH, MAYBE YOUR DAD'S RIGHT.
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE R.V.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.092
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE...

29:23.092 --> 29:25.995
THE ROAD JUGGERNAUT 8000.

29:25.995 --> 29:27.366
OHH!

29:27.366 --> 29:29.969
STATE-OF-THE-ART
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM,

29:29.969 --> 29:32.802
SIX PRIVATE
SLEEPING COMPARTMENTS,

29:32.802 --> 29:34.974
AND TWO FULL BATHS,

29:34.974 --> 29:38.447
ONE OF WHICH JUSTIN BIEBER USED
ON HIS LAST TOUR TO MAKE...

29:38.447 --> 29:40.379
(gasps) WATER BALLOONS.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.252
SHUT UP!
 (both) SHUT UP!

29:43.252 --> 29:46.956
(Preston) I'M BLOWN AWAY RIGHT
NOW! WE ARE GOING ON VACATION!

29:46.956 --> 29:50.289
(laughter)
 (under breath)
FOLLOW THAT, HAWAII.

29:52.321 --> 29:54.793
(crickets chirping)

29:54.793 --> 29:56.795
WILL YOU TAKE THAT OFF?

29:56.795 --> 29:57.796
NO.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.429
JUANITA,
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

30:00.429 --> 30:02.431
I DON'T CARE HOW I LOOK.

30:02.431 --> 30:05.434
I DON'T WANT THAT KILLER GUY
TO CHOP OFF MY HEAD.
 FIRST OF ALL,

30:05.434 --> 30:08.137
A HELMET WOULDN'T KEEP HIM
FROM CHOPPING OFF YOUR HEAD.

30:08.137 --> 30:10.439
IT WOULD JUST MEAN
I'D HAVE TO CLEAN IT

30:10.439 --> 30:14.383
BEFORE I GAVE IT BACK TO PARKER.
SECOND, THERE IS NO KILLER GUY.

30:14.383 --> 30:17.947
IT'S AN ACTOR IN A MOVIE.
 BUT I'M STILL SCARED.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.449
IT'S OKAY TO BE SCARED.
IT'S EVEN FUN SOMETIMES.

30:20.449 --> 30:24.053
BUT YOU CAN'T LET THAT SCARED
COME FROM INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD,

30:24.053 --> 30:27.056
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO CALM IT DOWN IF IT DOES.

30:27.056 --> 30:29.458
WHAT'S THAT?

30:29.458 --> 30:32.431
(scoffs) IT'S PEOPLE WALKING BY,
JUANITA.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.433
THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.136
THIS IS WHERE YOU TAKE CHARGE
OF YOUR FEAR.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.269
MAMA,
I THINK IT'S THE KILLER.

30:40.269 --> 30:42.912
NO, IT'S NOT, JUANITA.

30:42.912 --> 30:44.243
MOM, LOOK!

30:46.145 --> 30:47.446
AAH!

30:47.446 --> 30:50.549
OH! WHO'S OUT THERE?!
GO AWAY!

30:50.549 --> 30:53.052
(zips)

30:53.052 --> 30:55.424
(both scream)

30:55.424 --> 30:56.926
GOTCHA!

30:56.926 --> 30:59.088
(panting) WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU?!

30:59.088 --> 31:01.190
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

31:01.190 --> 31:05.334
BY GIVING ME A HEART ATTACK--
YOU THOUGHT THAT WOULD HELP?
 KINDA DID.

31:05.334 --> 31:10.069
(laughs) OH, MOM,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR FACE.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.071
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU

31:12.071 --> 31:14.373
THAT NOT EVERYTHING THAT
LOOKS SCARY ACTUALLY IS. SEE?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.405
(rattles)
 PLASTIC.

31:16.405 --> 31:19.478
IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE.
IT LOOKS SCARY, BUT IT'S FAKE.

31:19.478 --> 31:23.382
EXACTLY. I HAVE TO GO.
BOB'S IN THE SHOWER...

31:23.382 --> 31:26.085
AND HE'S ABOUT TO PAY
FOR NOT LIKING MY...

31:26.085 --> 31:29.358
(whispers) CHICKEN POT PIE.
 (chuckles)

31:29.358 --> 31:33.422
(steel guitar and ukulele
playing "Aloha 'Oe")
 SO WHEN YOU CAST YOUR VOTE
TONIGHT, KIDS,

31:33.422 --> 31:35.524
CAST IT FOR ADVENTURE...

31:35.524 --> 31:39.328
LUXURY, NATURE.

31:39.328 --> 31:42.531
'CAUSE HAWAII HAS SOMETHING
FOR EVERY SCAVO,

31:42.531 --> 31:45.304
WHETHER IT IS CIRCLING

31:45.304 --> 31:47.306
A SMOKING VOLCANO
IN A HELICOPTER

31:47.306 --> 31:51.480
OR SWIMMING IN CRYSTAL-CLEAR
WATERS WITH THE DOLPHINS.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.583
IT IS THE VACATION
OF A LIFETIME.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.145
AAH!

31:56.145 --> 32:00.519
(chanting) HAWAII! HAWAII!
HAWAII! HAWAII! HAWAII! HAWAII!

32:00.519 --> 32:03.222
HAWAII! HAWAII!

32:03.222 --> 32:04.423
HAWAII!

32:04.423 --> 32:07.526
HAWAII!
 WHOO!

32:07.526 --> 32:11.000
(music stops)
 I DIDN'T WANNA DO THIS.
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE

32:11.000 --> 32:15.164
LOVES SWIMMING
IN THOSE CRYSTAL-CLEAR WATERS?

32:15.164 --> 32:17.636
NATURE'S HUNGRIEST PREDATOR--
THE GREAT WHITE SHARK.

32:20.469 --> 32:23.472
COME ON. THERE HASN'T BEEN
A SHARK ATTACK ON THE ISLAND

32:23.472 --> 32:25.014
IN FOREVER.

32:25.014 --> 32:28.177
REALLY? OR DID THEY JUST FAIL
TO FIND THE EVIDENCE?

32:28.177 --> 32:31.680
GREAT WHITES
TEND TO EAT THEIR VICTIMS.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.153
WHAT?

32:34.153 --> 32:36.155
THIS IS VERY, VERY UNLIKELY
TO HAPPEN.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.456
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:37.456 --> 32:44.433
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY IF WE ALL
DIE FIRST IN...

32:44.433 --> 32:46.635
A GRUESOME HELICOPTER CRASH.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.071
NOW YOU SEE

32:52.071 --> 32:56.645
WHY THE NATIVES
CALL THEM DEATH BIRDS.

32:56.645 --> 32:58.707
YOU--YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFER

32:58.707 --> 33:00.449
DRIVING ACROSS COUNTRY?

33:00.449 --> 33:03.452
WHO KNOWS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE
OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH?

33:03.452 --> 33:06.685
OH, I DO. IT'S THE CAR CRASH.
 DON'T WORRY, KIDS. WE'RE GONNA
HIRE A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.487
IT WON'T BE YOUR DAD.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.460
GUYS, CAN WE GO UPSTAIRS
AND TALK ABOUT THIS

33:11.460 --> 33:12.991
BEFORE WE VOTE?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.723
YOU BET.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.227
WE AWAIT YOUR VERDICT.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.228
(Porter) YEAH.

33:19.228 --> 33:20.729
ALOHA!

33:20.729 --> 33:22.531
ALOHA!

33:28.307 --> 33:30.409
GOD, YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.141
HOW?

33:32.141 --> 33:34.643
TEN YEARS AGO, CHRISTMAS,

33:34.643 --> 33:36.645
WE ARE STANDING
IN THE SCOOTER AISLE

33:36.645 --> 33:39.518
AT THE TOY STORE
WHEN I WANNA CHOOSE

33:39.518 --> 33:42.121
THE TWINS' BIG PRESENT.

33:42.121 --> 33:46.325
YOU SAY, "TOM, WHEN YOU
START MAKING THE MONEY,

33:46.325 --> 33:48.527
YOU CAN START MAKING
THE DECISIONS."

33:48.527 --> 33:52.030
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING ON THAT
FOR A DECADE? WOW.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.032
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
 I MAKE THE MONEY--

33:54.032 --> 33:57.166
BIG MONEY--MORE MONEY
THAN YOU EVER DID,

33:57.166 --> 34:01.440
SO I GET TO DECIDE
HOW WE SPEND IT!

34:01.440 --> 34:03.442
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE EQUAL PARTNERS.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.415
I JUST WANTED A SAY
IN THE PROCESS.
 NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU WANNA CONTROL THE PROCESS

34:06.415 --> 34:09.318
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.
 WATCH IT.

34:09.318 --> 34:11.480
AND THEN YOU FEEL THAT POWER
SLIPPING AWAY,

34:11.480 --> 34:13.482
AND YOU CAN'T STAND IT.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.784
YOU CAN'T STAND
THAT I AM RUNNING THE SHOW.

34:15.784 --> 34:17.786
RUNNING THE SHOW?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

34:17.786 --> 34:19.788
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FAMILY VACATION--

34:19.788 --> 34:23.391
NOT ANYMORE WE ARE NOT!

34:23.391 --> 34:27.466
THIS IS ABOUT HOW
YOU CAN'T HANDLE MY SUCCESS.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.467
NO, YOU CAN'T HANDLE
YOUR SUCCESS.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.770
YOU'VE TURNED
INTO A POMPOUS ASS!

34:31.770 --> 34:35.204
MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S TURNED YOU
INTO A RAGING BITCH.

34:36.475 --> 34:40.449
(Penny sobbing)

34:44.612 --> 34:47.156
(sobbing continues)

34:47.156 --> 34:50.159
(crickets chirping)

34:53.422 --> 34:55.664
MM.

34:55.664 --> 34:58.667
(footsteps approach)

35:04.533 --> 35:06.835
(sighs)

35:06.835 --> 35:09.708
(lowered voice)
LEE! I AM WARNING YOU.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.481
ONCE WAS FUNNY.
THIS TIME, I WILL KILL YOU.

35:12.481 --> 35:13.782
GET OUT OF HERE!

35:16.515 --> 35:18.187
(dog barking in distance)

35:45.814 --> 35:46.815
HOW'S PENNY?

35:46.815 --> 35:48.317
REALLY UPSET.

35:48.317 --> 35:51.480
SHE KEPT CRYING AND SAYING HOW
SHE DIDN'T WANNA CHOOSE.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.423
I DON'T CARE WHERE WE GO.

35:54.423 --> 35:56.425
WE'LL TAKE THE ROAD TRIP.

35:56.425 --> 35:57.726
NOT THE VACATION, TOM.

35:57.726 --> 36:01.159
SHE DOESN'T WANNA CHOOSE
WHICH ONE OF US TO LIVE WITH.

36:01.159 --> 36:05.734
THAT IS AWFUL.
WHY WOULD SHE THINK THAT?

36:05.734 --> 36:10.168
WHY WOULDN'T SHE? SHE'S SEEN IT
HAPPEN TO THREE OF HER FRIENDS.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.641
WE HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT, TOM,
BUT NEVER LIKE THAT.

36:12.641 --> 36:15.244
I KNOW.
IT'S GOTTA STOP.

36:15.244 --> 36:16.445
I AGREE.

36:16.445 --> 36:18.176
I MEAN, I'M SCARED
TO OPEN MY MOUTH

36:18.176 --> 36:20.479
FOR FEAR YOU'RE GONNA
BITE MY HEAD OFF.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.382
I'M SORRY.
WAS THAT AN OLIVE BRANCH?

36:26.655 --> 36:29.588
I'M NO BETTER, OKAY?

36:29.588 --> 36:31.590
I MISS DINNER
FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK,

36:31.590 --> 36:35.464
AND EVEN WHEN
I AM HERE...

36:35.464 --> 36:37.826
MY MIND IS BACK
AT THE OFFICE.

36:44.473 --> 36:47.576
I THINK WE'RE THE ONES
WHO NEED A VACATION.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.211
ALONE.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.245
YEAH.

36:56.245 --> 36:58.887
NOT A BIG TRIP.
JUST A WEEKEND.

36:58.887 --> 37:01.590
WE CAN... GET A CHANCE
TO BE TOGETHER

37:01.590 --> 37:03.892
AND WORK
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

37:03.892 --> 37:06.625
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.657
WE SHOULD DO IT
THIS WEEKEND.

37:08.657 --> 37:10.959
YOU MEAN IT?

37:10.959 --> 37:13.962
YEAH.

37:13.962 --> 37:16.465
I JUST HAVE TO CHECK
WITH THE OFFICE.

37:16.465 --> 37:18.907
OKAY.

37:25.814 --> 37:27.816
BUT WE ARE GONNA DO IT,
RIGHT?

37:27.816 --> 37:31.420
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
ALL BUSY AT THE LAST MINUTE?
 I SAID WE'LL DO IT,

37:31.420 --> 37:33.852
AND WE'LL DO IT, OKAY?
 OKAY. OKAY.

37:37.626 --> 37:39.528
(cell phone keypad beeping)

37:39.528 --> 37:41.560
(children shouting playfully)

37:41.560 --> 37:42.891
HELLO, SUSAN.

37:42.891 --> 37:45.994
HEY, DANA. I GOT YOU
YOUR STREAMERS.

37:45.994 --> 37:49.568
I SPLURGED AND BOUGHT
THE GOOD ONES--FLAME-RETARDANT.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.641
GOOD. OH, MY GOD. ARE THOSE
COOKIES FOR THE OPEN HOUSE?

37:53.542 --> 37:55.003
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY--

37:55.003 --> 37:58.507
YOU ARE A LIFESAVER. I JUST HAD
TWO MOMS FLAKE OUT ON ME.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.349
REALLY?

38:00.349 --> 38:04.583
UH... WELL...

38:04.583 --> 38:07.586
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN,
SO I BAKED SOME JUST IN CASE.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.589
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT MAKES A GREAT TEACHER--

38:10.589 --> 38:12.821
BEING READY FOR ANYTHING.

38:12.821 --> 38:15.624
THANK YOU.

38:15.624 --> 38:19.528
YOU KNOW, SUSAN, I HAVEN'T
BEEN YOUR BIGGEST SUPPORTER,

38:19.528 --> 38:21.900
BUT MAYBE I MISJUDGED YOU.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.902
THANKS FOR THESE.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.905
LET'S FIND SOME TIME TO SIT DOWN
WITH PRINCIPAL HOBSON

38:26.905 --> 38:30.509
AND TALK ABOUT YOU
COMING BACK.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.080
(whispers) YES!

38:32.080 --> 38:34.543
(squeals)

38:37.315 --> 38:38.617
HELLO, SUSAN.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.789
COME ON IN.
 MEALS ON WHEELS.

38:40.789 --> 38:43.692
WELL, SHOES. BUT "FOOD ON SHOES"
DOESN'T SOUND AS GOOD.

38:43.692 --> 38:45.824
(chuckles)
TODAY'S SPECIAL IS LASAGNA.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.827
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PUT IT
ON A PLATE FOR YOU,

38:48.827 --> 38:51.059
OR DO YOU WANNA EAT IT LATER?

38:51.059 --> 38:53.061
I THINK I'LL HAVE IT NOW.

38:53.061 --> 38:55.504
IN FACT, I'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO JOIN ME.

38:55.504 --> 38:56.905
(whoosh)

38:56.905 --> 38:58.637
OH, I CAN'T.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.970
ACTUALLY, I'M ON MY WAY
TO A FUNCTION AT M.J.'s SCHOOL.

39:01.970 --> 39:04.673
I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A FEW MINUTES. SIT DOWN.

39:04.673 --> 39:07.476
UH...
I'M KIND OF IN A RUSH.

39:07.476 --> 39:08.977
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.

39:08.977 --> 39:11.480
YOU GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
TO BRING ME

39:11.480 --> 39:13.922
THESE DELICIOUS MEALS,
AND WE NEVER SHARE THEM.

39:13.922 --> 39:18.026
IT PAINS ME.
 UH...
PAUL, WHAT'S... GOING ON?

39:21.029 --> 39:24.032
FINE. YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

39:24.032 --> 39:27.095
WHY DON'T YOU STAB ME WITH THIS?
IT'LL BE FASTER.

39:27.095 --> 39:30.439
OR ARE YOU GETTING YOUR KICKS
WATCHING ME DIE SLOWLY?

39:30.439 --> 39:33.772
(clatters)
 OKAY, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.905
THE FOOD YOU'RE BRINGING ME,
SUSAN--IT'S POISONED.

39:36.905 --> 39:38.847
WHAT? THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

39:38.847 --> 39:42.611
I HAD IT TESTED.
COME ON. HAVE A BITE.

39:42.611 --> 39:43.912
PAUL.

39:43.912 --> 39:45.914
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

39:45.914 --> 39:47.916
IS IT BECAUSE YOU WANT
THE HOUSE?

39:47.916 --> 39:50.388
IS IT--IS IT BECAUSE
YOU HATE ME?

39:50.388 --> 39:53.161
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I NEVER PUT POISON IN YOUR FOOD.

39:53.161 --> 39:55.664
WELL, SOMEBODY DID.
WAS IT MIKE?

39:55.664 --> 39:59.598
NO! IT WAS JUST ME.
I-I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO...

39:59.598 --> 40:00.669
WHAT?

40:00.669 --> 40:04.903
OH, MY GOD.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.678
THE COOKIES. I-I'VE GOTTA GO.
I'VE GOTTA GET TO THE SCHOOL!

40:10.739 --> 40:13.742
(indistinct conversations)

40:15.444 --> 40:16.615
(door creaks)

40:16.615 --> 40:18.587
(panting)

40:18.587 --> 40:20.789
OH, CINDY, CINDY.
THE DESSERTS--

40:20.789 --> 40:23.792
THE DESSERTS, MY COOKIES--
HAVE THEY PUT THEM OUT YET?

40:23.792 --> 40:25.624
OH! YEAH.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.697
THEY'RE... JUST...

40:36.104 --> 40:37.606
OH! HA!
 (thud)

40:37.606 --> 40:39.768
I'M SO SORRY.
TRY THE OATMEAL RAISIN.

40:39.768 --> 40:42.471
KATHY, UM, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY POINTS THESE ARE?

40:42.471 --> 40:43.772
YOU'LL THANK ME TOMORROW.

40:43.772 --> 40:47.746
SUSAN? WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THE PARENTS' COUNCIL?

40:47.746 --> 40:49.447
THEY LOVE YOU.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.780
OH, GREAT! (chuckles)
THANKS FOR THE COOKIE.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.583
(chuckles and sighs)

40:54.583 --> 40:56.084
(gasps)

40:59.958 --> 41:02.791
OH. UH...

41:02.791 --> 41:04.963
UH, WHICH ONE OF THESE
IS--IS MINE?

41:04.963 --> 41:08.697
OOH, I HAVE NO IDEA.
WE JUST PUT 'EM ALL TOGETHER.

41:08.697 --> 41:10.669
OH!

41:10.669 --> 41:13.101
WHOOPS! SORRY. OH, SILLY ME.
 (clattering)

41:13.101 --> 41:15.003
CLUMSY!

41:15.003 --> 41:17.606
(amplified voice) IF I CAN HAVE
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION

41:17.606 --> 41:19.508
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

41:19.508 --> 41:22.611
HI. I WANNA WELCOME
ALL OUR WONDERFUL PARENTS.

41:22.611 --> 41:25.053
AND I WANNA THANK
THE DECORATING COMMITTEE

41:25.053 --> 41:28.256
AND THOSE WHO MADE
THE REFRESHMENTS.

41:28.256 --> 41:29.758
OH, INCLUDING SUSAN DELFINO.

41:29.758 --> 41:32.761
THANK YOU, SUSAN, FOR THOSE
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

41:32.761 --> 41:34.763
OH. (amplified voice)
UH... YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:34.763 --> 41:38.567
AND ABOUT THOSE COOKIES
I MADE--DON'T EAT THEM.

41:38.567 --> 41:40.529
THEY'RE POISON.

41:40.529 --> 41:41.700
(laughter)

41:41.700 --> 41:46.775
NO, NO, THIS ISN'T A JOKE.
MY COOKIES WILL KILL YOU.

41:46.775 --> 41:48.076
(door opens)

41:50.609 --> 41:52.681
OH, GOD.

41:52.681 --> 41:55.644
THAT'S HER, OFFICERS.

41:56.945 --> 42:01.149
YES, NO MATTER WHO WE ARE,

42:01.149 --> 42:04.853
WE ALL EXPERIENCE
MOMENTS OF DREAD...

42:04.853 --> 42:08.296
♪♪♪

42:08.296 --> 42:11.159
WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES,

42:11.159 --> 42:14.903
WILL ANYONE BELIEVE
I'M INNOCENT?

42:17.636 --> 42:21.710
WILL MY DAUGHTER
BE A CHILD OF DIVORCE?

42:23.912 --> 42:27.145
WILL THIS MAN BREAK MY HEART?

42:28.546 --> 42:33.722
ARE THERE THINGS
THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT?

42:37.185 --> 42:40.558
AND SOMETIMES...

42:40.558 --> 42:43.962
THE ANSWER...

42:43.962 --> 42:46.264
IS YES.
