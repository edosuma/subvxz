00:03.236 --> 00:04.636
[Margaret groans]

00:04.638 --> 00:06.672
[sobbing]

00:06.674 --> 00:09.975
- [Millie] Every step's gonna make it easier, I promise.
- [Margaret moaning]

00:16.383 --> 00:19.685
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:22.087
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.657
[exhales sharply and pants]

00:33.099 --> 00:36.502
[man] You can't do it
and then I just get mad.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.605
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.979
No. [sobbing] It hurts!

00:46.981 --> 00:51.316
<i>[woman 3] I refuse to stop fighting.
I have to do this for my children.</i>

00:57.323 --> 01:00.692
I don't know what went wrong.
I don't know.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.996
You wanna argue all that
with the scale? Be my guest.

01:23.616 --> 01:30.089
<i>[Dr. Now] A couple hours ago, Margaret
and her mom showed up here at the hospital.</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:35.761
<i>Margaret apparently fell yesterday
and she went to emergency room.</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:40.099
<i>She was transferred to here
because they didn't have any facility</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:44.803
<i>that will take care of
somebody that is 750 pounds.</i>

01:44.805 --> 01:46.638
<i>She is 35 years old,</i>

01:47.340 --> 01:51.143
<i>and she managed
to become 750 pounds.</i>

01:52.212 --> 01:57.916
She is only 5 foot 4 inches
tall, and her BMI is 129,

01:57.918 --> 02:01.653
<i>which is one of the highest
BMI I have ever seen.</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:04.089
<i>And that is very dangerous BMI.</i>

02:04.091 --> 02:07.726
<i>That, combined with the fact
she is not mobile,</i>

02:07.728 --> 02:11.930
has created a very
dire situation for her.

02:11.932 --> 02:17.035
<i>And she can barely stand up
from her bed to bedside commode.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:21.140
<i>When she fell,
she was short of breath.</i>

02:21.142 --> 02:26.145
<i>And she and her mom were
worried she was having a heart attack.</i>

02:26.147 --> 02:32.017
So we ran some tests on her to make sure
she doesn't have any life-threatening issues

02:32.019 --> 02:33.852
<i>we need to address right now.</i>

02:33.854 --> 02:38.657
But regardless, it's clear if
Margaret doesn't do something

02:38.659 --> 02:42.227
<i>to turn her life around, it's
only gonna be a matter of time</i>

02:42.229 --> 02:44.296
<i>before her body gives out.</i>

02:44.298 --> 02:49.034
<i>But at this point, I'm still
not sure she has any intention</i>

02:49.036 --> 02:51.336
to get the help
she needs to do that.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.706
Hello.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.441
[Margaret] Hello.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.977
Hi, Margaret.
I'm Dr. Nowzaradan.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.445
- [Margaret] Nice--
- How are you?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.147
Doing pretty good.
Nice to meet you.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.348
Nice to meet you.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.351
You weigh 750?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.986
[Margaret] Mm-hmm.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.122
So how long have you
been at that weight?

03:10.223 --> 03:11.857
I don't know.

03:11.859 --> 03:16.061
I haven't weighed myself
in three or four years.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.829
Do you get up and walk?

03:17.831 --> 03:21.233
The last time I was able to
really walk was six months ago.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.367
Who take care of you at home?

03:22.369 --> 03:23.902
My mom.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.140
Uh... so... Your mom
has any weight problem?

03:28.142 --> 03:30.642
She's had the gastric bypass.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.780
So if she had gastric bypass,
uh, why is she providing you

03:34.782 --> 03:37.683
too much food and keep you
in, uh, this way?

03:37.685 --> 03:40.452
Because it's easier
not to fight with me

03:41.154 --> 03:42.354
and just pacify me.

03:43.356 --> 03:47.226
So if she doesn't bring it
to you, what happen?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.461
I get mad at her and I tell
her that she doesn't love me.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.496
Okay.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.968
And so what do you think is gonna
happen to you if you continue that?

03:55.970 --> 03:57.369
I'm gonna die.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.007
I don't wanna die.
I wanna change.

04:02.009 --> 04:06.478
So why haven't you done anything to
change your situation up to this point?

04:08.281 --> 04:09.448
I've had abusive...

04:10.083 --> 04:11.416
Abusive life.

04:13.419 --> 04:17.656
What do you mean abusive? By
your parents? Or your family or who?

04:18.391 --> 04:21.293
My family. Especially my dad.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.463
I see.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.298
So you ate to deal with that.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.266
Yes.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.736
Food's my comfort.
I can hide underneath it.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.305
And nobody knows
what's going on in my life.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.142
So how motivated are you
to change your life

04:37.144 --> 04:42.481
and do your part and be able
to lose some weight?

04:42.483 --> 04:45.150
I'm willing to do
whatever I have to

04:45.152 --> 04:46.451
to have my surgery.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.920
All right.

04:48.922 --> 04:53.125
Okay, let's check a couple
thing and see how things are.

04:55.395 --> 04:58.997
I think we're gonna have our
work cut out for us with Margaret.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.901
<i>She says she wants
to change her situation,</i>

05:02.903 --> 05:06.338
<i>but so far she hasn't done
anything to change her life.</i>

05:06.340 --> 05:09.975
Can you lift your foot
up and down?

05:09.977 --> 05:15.647
Margaret said that she ask for the food
but, uh, I think the mother is enabler.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.251
<i>Amazing to me that her mother
had weight loss surgery herself,</i>

05:19.253 --> 05:23.188
<i>is continuing to help her
to eat as much as she wants,</i>

05:23.190 --> 05:26.792
and get her weight
up to 750 pounds.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.261
<i>So this is a very
pathological situation,</i>

05:29.263 --> 05:31.663
and I don't see any motivation.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.999
I don't see any goal
from Margaret.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.669
<i>But I'm ready to give her all the
tools she need to change her life</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:39.104
<i>and try to lose some weight.</i>

05:40.073 --> 05:44.042
Margaret, your BMI is 129.

05:44.044 --> 05:48.180
129 is very high BMI, okay?

05:48.182 --> 05:51.249
So this is very dangerous
situation you're in.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.118
So you have to change your life,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.121
and you have to try
harder, okay?

05:56.123 --> 05:59.224
While you're here, we can
control your eating habit.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.828
But when you go home,
you're gonna be on your own.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.697
And this is gonna be
the test for you.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.633
If you go home and you're not
able to change your eating habit,

06:08.635 --> 06:11.236
there's nothing
we can do for you, okay?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.972
So I'm gonna give you some
research that I want you to read.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.275
It will break down what
you can eat and cannot eat

06:17.277 --> 06:20.912
to do the diet
and what healthy eating is.

06:20.914 --> 06:25.484
So you need to follow it to where
you have some meaningful changes

06:25.486 --> 06:28.387
in your eating habit that's
gonna show on your scale.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.989
Okay? All right.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.695
Right now, we will get her
going in the right direction here

06:36.697 --> 06:38.730
<i>in a controlled environment.</i>

06:38.732 --> 06:42.701
But any progress we make
with her is going to be short-lived

06:42.703 --> 06:45.470
if she doesn't take
responsibility for her life.

06:45.472 --> 06:49.708
So what I want you to do is,
uh, every day, you read this.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.679
Three factor that control your weight,
your frequency, amount, and type of food.

06:54.681 --> 06:57.883
<i>But she doesn't have
any time for playing games.</i>

06:57.885 --> 07:01.086
<i>Because if she doesn't change
her situation soon,</i>

07:01.088 --> 07:02.754
then her time is gonna run out.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.591
This is gonna be something that you're
gonna have to work harder on, okay?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.227
- Okay.
- You think you can make all the changes?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.295
Yes.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.864
You think your mother
is gonna be on board1

07:12.866 --> 07:14.833
- with these changes?
- Yes.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.435
- So--
- She's on board.

07:16.437 --> 07:19.404
Okay. All right,
any questions?

07:22.341 --> 07:24.776
Just please help me.

07:24.778 --> 07:29.181
Well, we're gonna give you all the
tools you need, one step at a time.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.117
But you're gonna have
to do the hard work. Okay?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.453
I totally understand.

07:34.455 --> 07:39.324
Okay. Stick with healthy
eating habit and then try harder.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.793
And if you need anything,
give me a call.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.061
I will do, thank you.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.564
All right, I'll be back
and see you later, okay?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.870
<i>[Margaret] I'm thankful
I made it here.</i>

07:51.872 --> 07:53.605
<i>And that I've been able
to see Dr. Now.</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:56.975
<i>It's an answered prayer.</i>

07:56.977 --> 08:00.579
<i>Because I know I've let myself
get to a breaking point.</i>

08:01.848 --> 08:04.349
<i>And I could have easily
died especially when I fell.</i>

08:05.117 --> 08:07.085
<i>So I have to change now.</i>

08:07.087 --> 08:11.223
<i>Because if I don't, it's going
to be too late for me.</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:26.738
<i>[Margaret] I'm here
in the hospital.</i>

08:26.740 --> 08:28.540
<i>I've been here
for about two weeks,</i>

08:28.542 --> 08:32.244
<i>and that was not part of the
plan when I left the house.</i>

08:32.246 --> 08:37.315
<i>But Dr. Now said I might be able to go
home today, so I'm excited about that.</i>

08:38.217 --> 08:40.185
<i>I'm ready to get on
doing his program</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:41.920
<i>and showing him I can do it.</i>

08:41.922 --> 08:44.289
<i>I need his help
because things are bad,</i>

08:44.291 --> 08:46.124
<i>and they're just getting worse.</i>

08:48.227 --> 08:50.095
- Hey, you ready?
- [Margaret] Yes.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.098
- Ready to go home soon, baby?
- Yes.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.001
I'm ready to go home.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.235
[Millie] I'm just glad
to see you.

09:07.413 --> 09:08.413
[knocking at door]

09:08.981 --> 09:10.015
[Margaret] Who?

09:11.417 --> 09:12.951
Hello, how are you all doing?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.519
Hi, Doctor.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.954
Hi, Margaret, how are you doing?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.155
Doing pretty good.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.823
So how is your mom doing?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.325
You finally get
to meet me in person.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.127
All right, you doing okay?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.930
Yeah, working 42 hours
a week doesn't cut it.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.132
[laughs] I don't get to meet
very many people.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.035
Well, you know, Margaret
is in very poor shape.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.972
She came in at 750 pounds.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.241
- [Millie] That's the starting
point-- - And we kept her on a diet.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.344
In a few days,
she lost 30 pounds.

09:39.346 --> 09:43.081
- So that is what we need to continue at home.
- [Millie] We are.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.052
But I'm gonna give you a goal
of at least 30 pounds each month,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.854
when we wanna see you in
the office and get your weight.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.425
I expect that you lose
100 pounds in three months.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.793
- All right?
- In three months? Okay.

09:54.795 --> 09:58.163
Yeah. If you continue to lose
weight, then we can work with you

09:58.165 --> 10:00.165
and get you to a point
that you're gonna be able

10:00.167 --> 10:02.534
to hopefully have
weight loss surgery.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.135
[Millie] Margaret, how bad
do you want this surgery?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.303
[Margaret] Bad.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.839
- How bad do you want this surgery?
- Bad, Mama.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.941
Then we're gonna work
at every point to get it,

10:09.943 --> 10:11.376
- are we not?
- Yes.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.212
We will order physical therapy and
home health to come and see her.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.982
Get her stamina up so
she can get up and walk

10:16.984 --> 10:18.950
and perhaps come to the office.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.287
And home health is gonna help
with the personal hygiene.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.056
And we already had the
dietician come to talk to her.

10:25.058 --> 10:30.662
She has written the stuff that she need
to read every day and follow the diet.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.931
If she's not able to follow the
diet, we're not gonna be able

10:32.933 --> 10:35.834
- to do anything for her.
- We're going to follow this diet.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.037
No sugary drink
and a lot of exercise, okay?

10:39.039 --> 10:41.940
And you need to have
a positive influence on her.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.376
I had the gastric bypass
seven years ago.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.645
All right, so you should
know better, right?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.213
- You help her.
- Oh, I know all about that.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.116
No, it makes me have the heart
palpitations, the dumping syndrome.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.751
It makes me just
feel plain miserable.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.352
No, I know my limits.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.422
Okay. So we got
a lot of work to do.

10:57.424 --> 11:01.993
And now that you know in one week
we can lose 30 pounds in the hospital,

11:01.995 --> 11:04.729
you should be able
to do that at home too.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.332
- Is that not awesome?
- [Margaret] Yes, it is.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.268
We'll send her home today
and in a year and a half,

11:10.270 --> 11:12.971
- we can get her under 200.
- Yes.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.173
So this is gonna
be the goal, okay?

11:15.175 --> 11:18.209
I want her to be looking
like her mama.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.813
All right then. You're all looking
good and take care, okay?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.915
- I'll see you later.
- 'Cause you got some pretty eyes

11:23.917 --> 11:25.450
and you're a beautiful child.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.222
<i>[Dr. Now] We had Margaret in the
hospital for couple of weeks now.</i>

11:31.224 --> 11:34.693
<i>Most of the tests we ran
on her when she arrived</i>

11:34.695 --> 11:40.198
didn't show any immediate issues
with her except an infection in her leg

11:40.200 --> 11:43.034
<i>that cleared up
after we treated it.</i>

11:43.036 --> 11:47.272
While she's been here, we
had her on a controlled diet.

11:47.274 --> 11:51.042
<i>And in two weeks, we have
been able to get her weight down</i>

11:51.044 --> 11:53.778
67 pounds from when she arrived.

11:53.780 --> 11:58.183
<i>She was 752. Now she's at 685.</i>

11:58.185 --> 12:02.153
So we have made some progress
on that front with her.

12:02.155 --> 12:06.224
And we have also been
providing her physical therapy

12:06.226 --> 12:09.060
<i>to help her get up and walk.</i>

12:09.062 --> 12:12.263
<i>She pushed back some,
but overall she's doing well.</i>

12:12.265 --> 12:15.800
<i>And we have her moving
in the right direction now.</i>

12:15.802 --> 12:20.405
So the next step is for her to
show me she can do this on her own

12:20.407 --> 12:22.440
<i>if she wants to continue.</i>

12:22.442 --> 12:25.877
<i>Hopefully, Margaret
and her mom, Millie,</i>

12:25.879 --> 12:28.780
are as serious
as they are telling me.

12:28.782 --> 12:32.350
<i>Because they both need
to make a lot of changes</i>

12:32.352 --> 12:37.322
if Margaret is gonna have any
chance of success in the long term.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.194
I know it's rough,
but guess what?

12:43.196 --> 12:46.631
This is that miracle we
prayed for, isn't it? Mm-hmm?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.502
-[sobbing] -We finally
got it. Give me a high-five.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.178
- You prove to him you can do it.
- [crying]

13:00.180 --> 13:01.212
[Millie] Okay?

13:02.848 --> 13:04.649
You don't have to prove
to me, I already know it.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.724
- Prove him wrong.
- [crying]

13:12.726 --> 13:15.059
I'll put a picture
on the end of the bed

13:15.061 --> 13:17.962
and let you look at it every
day when you think about it.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.698
You say, "I'm gonna
prove them wrong."

13:42.054 --> 13:44.022
Oh, I need to put
some powder right here.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.924
You're rashed.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.860
<i>[Margaret] It's been a week since
I've come home from the hospital.</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:51.362
<i>And since then, I've been
trying to eat like Dr. Now says</i>

13:51.364 --> 13:53.898
<i>and to do the exercises
he wants.</i>

13:53.900 --> 13:58.069
<i>But ever since then, I've been
really scared of falling like I did before</i>

13:58.071 --> 14:01.372
<i>because my legs have such a
hard time supporting all my weight.</i>

14:03.142 --> 14:05.143
Look, look!
Isn't that something?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.012
Yes! Yes!

14:11.951 --> 14:14.152
<i>[Margaret] And I don't wanna
let her down,</i>

14:14.154 --> 14:17.021
<i>so I'm doing what
Dr. Now told us to do</i>

14:17.023 --> 14:19.123
<i>'cause I know I need
to get this surgery</i>

14:19.125 --> 14:21.392
<i>so I can live a life
more than this.</i>

14:25.130 --> 14:26.164
Ready, honey? You ready?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.532
One, two, three!

14:28.234 --> 14:29.400
Up, one more time.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.271
Now.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.041
- All right, you want a salad?
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.512
<i>[Margaret] But food has always
been there for me.</i>

14:41.514 --> 14:43.648
<i>And if you take that
away from me,</i>

14:43.650 --> 14:46.150
<i>I'm not sure how
I'm supposed to get by.</i>

14:50.022 --> 14:52.090
<i>I've been eating
wrong my whole life.</i>

14:52.092 --> 14:55.793
<i>Not just the wrong foods
but for the wrong reasons too.</i>

14:55.795 --> 14:58.196
<i>In my kid years,
we were starving</i>

14:58.198 --> 15:00.031
<i>because my daddy
ate up all the food.</i>

15:00.033 --> 15:01.633
My dad was 1,000 pounds.

15:02.801 --> 15:05.470
<i>I have two other sisters,
Becky and Tiffany.</i>

15:05.472 --> 15:08.172
<i>And between us, all we
got to do is eat his leftovers.</i>

15:10.175 --> 15:14.345
<i>If we ever complained, Mama would
shush us so we wouldn't upset him</i>

15:14.347 --> 15:16.681
<i>because my dad
was a terrifying man.</i>

15:19.151 --> 15:22.487
[crying] My dad was
very controlling.

15:22.489 --> 15:26.157
<i>And if he said, "You be right
here," she had to be right there.</i>

15:26.159 --> 15:28.927
<i>That's how he was.</i>

15:28.929 --> 15:33.231
You'd wanna hide your feelings away
from him 'cause if you argued with him,

15:33.233 --> 15:38.503
then he would call us names
and just be very mean.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.372
<i>So I learned to sneak
into the kitchen</i>

15:41.374 --> 15:43.741
<i>and I ate his food
to get back at him.</i>

15:43.743 --> 15:46.210
<i>When I ate my dad's food
it was for revenge,</i>

15:46.212 --> 15:48.313
<i>so he wouldn't have it
for his self.</i>

15:48.315 --> 15:49.981
<i>[Millie] She'd get up
in the middle of the night.</i>

15:49.983 --> 15:52.050
If we had something leftover
in the ice box,

15:52.052 --> 15:54.652
she'd go in there
and she would make it

15:54.654 --> 15:56.688
look like she didn't eat it,
but she did eat it.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.693
<i>[Margaret] That's how I got to
120 pounds by the time I was 6.</i>

16:01.695 --> 16:06.564
<i>That's when I was diagnosed with early
signs of diabetes and an eating disorder.</i>

16:08.267 --> 16:11.970
<i>My mom, she started preparing
me my own special meals,</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:14.372
<i>just like she did for my dad.</i>

16:14.374 --> 16:16.074
<i>Except mine was healthier.</i>

16:16.076 --> 16:19.010
<i>And it worked,
I started to lose weight.</i>

16:19.012 --> 16:22.814
<i>And I was happier because I was getting
the attention and the love I was craving.</i>

16:22.816 --> 16:25.850
<i>But my dad did not like not
having all the attention on him.</i>

16:25.852 --> 16:30.154
<i>My dad would make my
mom leave us and go with him.</i>

16:30.156 --> 16:36.194
<i>[Millie] He demanded that I had to be at
the hospital with him every time he went.</i>

16:36.196 --> 16:38.029
<i>I had to go with him
to the doctor's.</i>

16:38.031 --> 16:40.298
<i>He had to go to Dallas.</i>

16:40.300 --> 16:45.003
And for two months, I had to
be completely away from my kids

16:45.005 --> 16:48.573
and live in Dallas, while
they stayed back in Arkansas.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.309
<i>[Margaret] My mom sent us
down the road</i>

16:51.311 --> 16:54.178
<i>to live with our grandmother
on my dad's side.</i>

16:54.180 --> 16:58.149
<i>She was the reason my dad
is as messed up as he was.</i>

16:58.151 --> 16:59.984
I'd call her "Evil Grandma."

17:00.652 --> 17:02.053
Or, "The Wicked Witch."

17:02.855 --> 17:05.690
<i>She's the reason why my dad
has so much hate in his heart.</i>

17:05.692 --> 17:08.960
<i>I remember one of the ways that
she would abuse me was with food.</i>

17:08.962 --> 17:13.765
<i>She made me eat 10 eggs in a
row 'cause I said I was hungry.</i>

17:13.767 --> 17:16.934
<i>But my mama must have figured
it out how my grandmother was,</i>

17:16.936 --> 17:19.504
<i>because she sent us to go stay
with my aunt Carla.</i>

17:19.506 --> 17:21.372
<i>Oh, Aunt Carla,
I really loved her.</i>

17:21.374 --> 17:23.374
<i>I really, really loved her.</i>

17:25.177 --> 17:26.811
<i>When we got to go
to Aunt Carla's,</i>

17:26.813 --> 17:28.913
<i>it was the first time
in my life where I could eat</i>

17:28.915 --> 17:31.449
<i>without being attacked
or ridiculed.</i>

17:31.451 --> 17:34.052
<i>The time we spent there were
the happiest times of my life.</i>

17:34.753 --> 17:36.354
<i>We got to be real close.</i>

17:36.356 --> 17:40.558
<i>And then, around when I started
high school, I lost my aunt Carla.</i>

17:42.428 --> 17:47.031
<i>She was like a second mama
to me, a guardian angel, my hero.</i>

17:47.033 --> 17:49.067
<i>She died very courageously</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:52.203
<i>from a blood-clot that broke off
from her heart and went to her lungs.</i>

17:52.205 --> 17:54.472
<i>Losing my aunt Carla
took a piece of my heart.</i>

17:54.474 --> 17:56.240
<i>I was crushed.</i>

17:56.242 --> 17:58.309
<i>So again, I resorted to food,</i>

17:58.311 --> 18:01.846
<i>because food was the only thing
I had to make the pain go away.</i>

18:01.848 --> 18:06.317
<i>And by the time I was 15,
I was pushing 300 pounds.</i>

18:06.319 --> 18:10.421
Everybody was cruel to Margaret
about one thing or the other.

18:10.423 --> 18:15.026
<i>By the time she was 16, she was so
depressed that she just wanted to die.</i>

18:15.028 --> 18:20.398
It was all due to her needing
to feed what was wrong in here.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.400
When she looked in the mirror,

18:22.634 --> 18:27.171
apparently she didn't love who
she was even though I loved her.

18:27.173 --> 18:31.342
<i>I don't know why she felt like
she wasn't important.</i>

18:31.344 --> 18:33.478
<i>I didn't know how to help her.</i>

18:35.047 --> 18:37.248
<i>[Margaret] I finished my
senior year without friends.</i>

18:37.250 --> 18:39.217
<i>And I just kept eating.</i>

18:39.219 --> 18:42.220
<i>So after I left high school,
I was about 400 pounds.</i>

18:43.956 --> 18:47.291
<i>I tried looking for a job
but nobody wanted me.</i>

18:47.293 --> 18:50.228
<i>By the time I was 20,
I was pushing 500 pounds.</i>

18:50.230 --> 18:53.097
<i>It was hard for me to drive
or do things for myself.</i>

18:53.866 --> 18:55.399
<i>I went on disability.</i>

18:56.034 --> 18:58.402
<i>My dad became more abusive.</i>

18:58.404 --> 19:01.272
<i>After that, my mom reached
a point of no return.</i>

19:01.274 --> 19:02.406
<i>So she packed her stuff</i>

19:02.408 --> 19:04.108
<i>and left
with my older sister, Tiffany,</i>

19:04.110 --> 19:05.810
<i>to take shelter with a friend.</i>

19:05.812 --> 19:09.881
<i>I woke up the next morning and
my sister and my mama were gone.</i>

19:09.883 --> 19:14.018
<i>So my dad told me she had abandoned
me because I was a fat pig and useless</i>

19:14.020 --> 19:15.953
<i>and she couldn't take care
of me no more.</i>

19:15.955 --> 19:20.424
Losing her was the most
upsetting part of my life.

19:20.426 --> 19:24.662
<i>I didn't care if I lived or
died, so I would eat to escape.</i>

19:24.664 --> 19:27.665
<i>I was so terribly lonely.</i>

19:27.667 --> 19:30.134
She would just sit there
and urinate on herself

19:30.136 --> 19:32.336
and that's pretty much
where she stayed.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.906
<i>I mean, she was always
a lonely child to begin with,</i>

19:34.908 --> 19:37.542
<i>and now she was
being alienated and thinking,</i>

19:37.544 --> 19:40.111
<i>"Mama don't love me,
she's abandoned me,"</i>

19:40.113 --> 19:42.246
then self-destruct.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.785
<i>[Margaret] I found out that my
dad told lies to my mama about me.</i>

19:47.787 --> 19:49.453
<i>He was telling her I hated her,</i>

19:49.455 --> 19:52.823
<i>and that I was furious
that she left without me,</i>

19:52.825 --> 19:54.992
<i>and that I was glad
she was gone.</i>

19:54.994 --> 19:58.462
<i>Hearing all of this for the first
time put me in a state of shock.</i>

19:58.464 --> 20:00.998
<i>I never wanted
to see my dad again.</i>

20:01.000 --> 20:03.234
<i>I begged my mom to take me back.</i>

20:03.236 --> 20:07.672
<i>[crying] Mama said, "Baby, you can
live with me, I never said you couldn't.</i>

20:07.674 --> 20:09.974
I never told you
I didn't want you.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.910
I just didn't want your daddy
no more."

20:12.912 --> 20:16.681
<i>I was so relieved, I kept
eating like I always did.</i>

20:16.683 --> 20:22.053
<i>And before I knew it, I was 750
pounds, dependent on my mama.</i>

20:22.055 --> 20:25.489
<i>My cellulitis infection
had gone into my blood stream.</i>

20:25.491 --> 20:29.493
<i>The infection kept getting worse,
and that took me down more.</i>

20:29.495 --> 20:33.564
<i>And before I knew it, I had
become dependent on my mama.</i>

20:35.300 --> 20:38.636
<i>But this feels like a stroke of
luck to be working with Dr. Now.</i>

20:38.638 --> 20:41.339
<i>I know he helps a lot
of people like me.</i>

20:41.341 --> 20:46.077
<i>And I have my daddy's voice in my
head telling me I'm a no good failure,</i>

20:46.079 --> 20:48.079
<i>and that just makes me
wanna give up.</i>

20:48.081 --> 20:50.081
<i>My biggest fear is
what if he's right.</i>

20:50.083 --> 20:52.149
<i>So I know I have to do this.</i>

20:52.151 --> 20:54.785
<i>I am just afraid that
I won't be able to.</i>

20:54.787 --> 20:56.988
<i>Because if I can't,
that's really the end for me.</i>

20:56.990 --> 20:58.756
<i>So I just gotta give it my best</i>

20:58.758 --> 21:00.958
<i>and hope and pray
that's good enough.</i>

21:17.409 --> 21:20.344
[Millie] All right, let me get
you up and let's get you going.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.185
You want some coffee?

21:28.187 --> 21:29.320
[Margaret] No.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.989
[Millie] One of them days?

21:31.991 --> 21:36.093
My mom woke me up this morning
and I hurt in the leg.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.695
All right,
get your bearings together.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.031
I'm gonna fix me a cup of coffee
and I be in here to get you up.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.533
[Margaret]
<i>Everyday is a new struggle.</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:45.903
<i>Today my leg
is really bad swollen.</i>

21:45.905 --> 21:48.172
And so it... It just...
It hurts.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.007
All right, Margaret.

21:50.009 --> 21:53.044
PT called me and they're
gonna be out this morning,

21:53.046 --> 21:55.012
but I need to get you up
before they come.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.781
Okay?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.949
So let's get this show
on the road.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.452
<i>Today, I'm supposed to go
to physical therapy,</i>

22:01.454 --> 22:04.255
<i>but usually I don't have
this swollen leg.</i>

22:04.257 --> 22:06.524
And so, I just didn't really
want to do nothing today.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.732
I did call and try to get her
on the schedule for next week,

22:14.734 --> 22:17.301
<i>and it's just been tough.
I mean, it's been tough.</i>

22:17.303 --> 22:20.471
<i>I can't tell you how many times
a week she tells me she quits.</i>

22:23.041 --> 22:25.309
[Millie] PT's gonna be in here.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.445
- [Margaret] Shut up!
- [dogs barking]

22:27.512 --> 22:30.481
[Millie] Dr. Now, he needs you
to get up 'cause of the blood clot.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.716
And every [bleep] damn
thing else.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.484
You already have a history
of diabetes.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.921
[Margaret] Yeah, I know. But they keep
pushing on you, and they keep pushing on me.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.989
[crying] I'm sick of it!

22:38.991 --> 22:40.591
- [dogs barking] - [Millie]
We're not coming today.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.396
[Margaret] Told you to just
leave me alone, Mom.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.098
[Millie] No, I'm not.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.100
[woman] I'm assuming
that was her mom.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.035
[Margaret] It's all about
what you want.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.137
[Millie] Okay, fine, I quit.
You want that?

22:53.271 --> 22:56.674
[Millie speaking]

22:58.143 --> 23:02.246
[woman] Okay, I don't know how quickly
we'll be able to get scheduled next week

23:02.248 --> 23:05.049
'cause we really moved
things around to see her.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.052
There's not any way
she'll do any PT today

23:08.054 --> 23:10.121
to make sure that she can get
scheduled for surgery?

23:14.926 --> 23:16.227
[Millie] Hello.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.696
Hi, Miss Margaret, I'm Mallory.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.464
So I'm the physical therapist.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.667
I think they just wanted us to
kind of do a general assessment

23:23.669 --> 23:25.870
and see kind of where you're at.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.172
Um, normally are you able
to, like...

23:28.174 --> 23:30.141
Right now, you're not...
I'm not gonna make you sit up.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.343
- But if you needed to sit up, are you able to sit up?
- Yes.

23:32.345 --> 23:33.677
- You're able to sit up all by yourself?
- Yes.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.679
- Not... No help, no nothing?
- No help.

23:35.681 --> 23:38.783
- Okay, what about like getting up from sitting to standing?
- I can get up like that, too.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.384
- You can?
- I can do it by myself.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.019
- Okay, you can do all that part by yourself?
- Yes.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.488
- No issues?
- It's just I'm having problems walking.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.124
- And so-- - Is it, like,
balance problems walking--

23:47.126 --> 23:48.325
- Yes.
- or pain problems?

23:48.327 --> 23:49.460
It's balance and pain.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.662
And pain. Okay, where is
the pain when you're walking?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.063
- My knees.
- In your knees.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.599
- Okay, is it the whole knee, or
like-- - Oh, yes. It's the whole knee.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.368
- Everywhere?
- Uh, they... I have no cartilage in them.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.203
- Okay, no cartilage in either knee.
- So they hurt.

23:59.205 --> 24:04.208
Okay, um, how far are you
normally able to walk

24:04.210 --> 24:06.811
before you have to sit?

24:06.813 --> 24:09.079
From here to the computer table.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.515
Okay, can you lift
this foot up toward you?

24:11.517 --> 24:13.417
Okay, hold it right there.
Don't let me push.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.985
- Does that hurt?
- Nope.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.587
No. Okay, can you push down
into my hand?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.457
Good what about this side?
Can you bring it up?

24:19.459 --> 24:21.592
Hold it up, don't let me push.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.227
- [Margaret groans]
- Ooh, that one hurt?

24:23.229 --> 24:25.896
- Or is it hard to do?
- It's hard to do it because it's making that knee hurt.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.698
[Mallory] That's making your knee
hurt when you try and hold it up?

24:27.700 --> 24:29.166
Okay, can you push down?

24:29.168 --> 24:30.167
- Does that make--
- Mm-mm.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.802
That makes
your knee hurt, too? Yeah?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.705
Here. Can you pull like
you're trying to pull me?

24:34.707 --> 24:37.641
Okay, what about push?
Can you push? Okay.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.077
Okay, can you hold your arm right
here? Don't let me push it down.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.179
Hold it right there.
Any pain? No?

24:42.181 --> 24:45.950
Can you lift it up above?
Yeah, you can? Okay.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.886
- All right, you have any weakness in your arms?
- No.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.789
Like, in your hands
or anything? No?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.859
We made you kind of a goody bag so
you have some stuff that you can do.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.260
'Cause I've got the purple one.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.162
Yeah, so this... This is blue.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.296
I don't know what...
They're just...

24:59.298 --> 25:01.632
- Different brands have
different colors-- - See?

25:02.334 --> 25:03.601
- Oh, yeah.
- But watch.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.503
I can...

25:06.071 --> 25:07.471
- Does that hurt?
- Nope.

25:07.473 --> 25:11.141
Okay, when you're standing, do
you have to hold on to something?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.409
- Yes.
- Yes? Okay.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.079
- If you don't hold on to
something-- - I'm wobbly.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.047
I just have to have
something to hold on to

25:17.049 --> 25:18.616
because I'm not
stable in the feet.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.084
Okay.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.119
- Okay, you have pain in your feet?
- No.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.288
-No, only in your knees? No hip pain?
-Nope.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.289
- No back pain?
- Mm-mm.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.324
Nothing? Okay.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.693
- We gave you a stress ball.
- [laughs]

25:29.695 --> 25:31.095
[Mallory laughs]
Girl, squeeze away.

25:31.097 --> 25:34.231
- You know how much I'm gonna be using this?
- [Mallory] That's okay.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.634
I can give you one of these
in each hand.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.169
<i>[Margaret] I feel better after
meeting the physical trainers.</i>

25:39.171 --> 25:42.339
<i>They're nice people and they
got my best interests at heart.</i>

25:42.341 --> 25:44.174
<i>So they can come back
on the right day</i>

25:44.176 --> 25:45.943
<i>and we can work together
some more.</i>

25:45.945 --> 25:48.379
<i>That will be good
when we do that.</i>

25:48.381 --> 25:52.182
<i>In the meantime, I'll do more
on my own and with my mama.</i>

25:52.184 --> 25:54.118
All right, it was good
working with you

25:54.120 --> 25:56.186
and we will, hopefully,
see you soon.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.922
- Okay, yes.
- Okay? All right.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.657
-Bye, nice to meet you.
-All right, yeah, you too. All right.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.125
- Thanks.
- No problem.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.296
[Millie] Margaret,
we have got to get up.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.335
- Come on.
- I'm coming, Mama.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.670
No, I don't have
a lot of time, Margaret.

26:48.673 --> 26:51.675
[bleeping].

26:51.677 --> 26:53.110
[Millie] Come on.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.485
[exhales]

27:19.204 --> 27:21.639
Push, push, push, push.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.546
It'll be worth it.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.082
Is this not what we've wanted
for seven years?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.194
You remember?
You were my partner then.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.420
[Millie] I know it's rough.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.655
[Margaret] Yeah,
you don't know nothing.

28:16.461 --> 28:17.661
[dog barking]

28:37.248 --> 28:38.415
I got you.

28:45.757 --> 28:47.925
I'm done.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.060
[Millie] I just want you to walk
one more time, and then back--

28:50.062 --> 28:51.462
I'm done.

28:51.464 --> 28:52.963
This is really hurting
me right now.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.935
Get over this "I feel sorry
for Margaret" stuff.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.104
- Mom, shut the hell up!
- [Millie] No, I'm not.

29:01.372 --> 29:04.575
It is very important
that he sees you're moving.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.345
I've let you get away
with this way too long.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.614
Now, it's time to get up.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.283
- [Margaret cries]
- Now, come on!

29:15.053 --> 29:17.888
- Why are you pushing me so--
- [Millie] Because I am.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.224
I'm gonna run
go get my clothes on.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.333
This is your last shot,
so come on.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.201
[sighs]

29:32.937 --> 29:35.672
[groaning]

29:35.674 --> 29:37.441
- Every step.
- [Margaret cries]

29:37.443 --> 29:39.276
[Millie] Yes, it will.
Every step.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.483
[Margaret] One, two.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.995
Now, because this leg
is so edematous,

30:31.997 --> 30:33.897
- scoot over some more in bed.
- I will.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.532
It's just swollen and it hurts.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.434
I'm getting sick.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.203
That's that shot.

30:40.371 --> 30:42.606
[groaning]

30:42.907 --> 30:44.341
Oh.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.765
<i>[Margaret] I've been working
really hard this past month.</i>

31:08.767 --> 31:13.370
<i>And I've worked out a lot
and got a lot more mobile.</i>

31:13.372 --> 31:18.175
<i>But I've had to do it all on my own
because PT has not been coming.</i>

31:19.143 --> 31:21.278
<i>But I've been doing fine
on my own.</i>

31:22.146 --> 31:23.881
<i>I got a little bit more slower,</i>

31:23.883 --> 31:26.183
<i>and maybe the PT
won't like that.</i>

31:28.453 --> 31:32.322
<i>But it's better to me that way
because my leg has been hurting me.</i>

31:33.091 --> 31:35.158
<i>And it keeps getting worse.</i>

31:36.160 --> 31:39.830
<i>I don't wanna push myself
so far that I injure myself.</i>

31:39.832 --> 31:44.167
<i>But I've been able to get a lot more
mobile and that feels really good.</i>

31:45.336 --> 31:48.105
<i>I'm really happy about that.</i>

31:48.107 --> 31:51.074
<i>And I really want Dr. Now to
see how much weight I've lost,</i>

31:51.910 --> 31:54.645
<i>and how much I can get around.</i>

31:54.647 --> 32:00.050
<i>But my mom had to work today, so
she can't drive me to my appointment.</i>

32:00.052 --> 32:04.054
<i>So I'm not going to the clinic
because I had to cancel it.</i>

32:04.056 --> 32:07.591
<i>But Dr. Now set up a video
call to see me anyways.</i>

32:10.261 --> 32:13.497
<i>And I'm worried that he's gonna
say I'm not taking it seriously.</i>

32:14.098 --> 32:17.034
<i>But I really am.</i>

32:17.036 --> 32:22.272
<i>If it wasn't for my leg hurting so
much, then I'd be doing even more.</i>

32:22.274 --> 32:24.341
<i>It's just really that
my mama's gotta work.</i>

32:28.980 --> 32:31.114
[video call rings]

32:33.284 --> 32:34.384
<i>Hi, Margaret.</i>

32:34.386 --> 32:35.953
Hi.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.120
<i>How are you today?</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:39.189
In pain.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.993
<i>[Dr. Now] So is that why you're
not making it in to see me today?</i>

32:42.995 --> 32:47.197
<i>Because last I talked to you, you said
you're gonna be able to come to office,</i>

32:47.199 --> 32:49.967
<i>and frankly,
that's not happening.</i>

32:49.969 --> 32:52.769
<i>So give me some idea
what's going on with you.</i>

32:52.771 --> 32:56.173
Mom had to work today,
and so I had no way of coming.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.375
I'm in pain but I'm willing
to deal with that to see you.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.277
<i>Your mom had to work today?</i>

33:00.279 --> 33:01.812
And I didn't have a ride.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.215
<i>[Dr. Now] Come on, Margaret, we
had this scheduled for a while now.</i>

33:05.217 --> 33:08.819
<i>And you could have called me
to let me know that before today.</i>

33:08.821 --> 33:11.121
<i>So I don't believe
that's the reason.</i>

33:11.123 --> 33:12.889
[Margaret]
It's the only reason, Dr. Now.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.992
My leg hurts
but that wouldn't stop me.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.260
<i>I just need my mom
to drive me and she can't.</i>

33:17.262 --> 33:19.329
[Dr. Now]
<i>Now, physical therapy says</i>

33:19.331 --> 33:22.666
<i>you haven't been cooperating
with them most days.</i>

33:22.668 --> 33:23.900
[Margaret] No, that's not it.

33:23.902 --> 33:26.436
They haven't been coming
consistently for physical therapy.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.806
<i>[Dr. Now] They have, but you
turn them away a lot of times.</i>

33:29.808 --> 33:34.644
<i>But we're gonna make sure we have physical
therapy come to you no matter what.</i>

33:34.646 --> 33:37.314
<i>But right now,
I want to see your progress.</i>

33:37.316 --> 33:40.050
<i>So you need
to come see me today.</i>

33:40.052 --> 33:41.351
[Margaret]
I don't have a ride.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.787
<i>Margaret, you can use METROLift.</i>

33:43.789 --> 33:45.956
I'm not heard nothing
about METROLift.

33:45.958 --> 33:49.926
<i>You have to call METROLift and you
set a time, they come and pick you up.</i>

33:49.928 --> 33:53.163
<i>I'll get Rosie to give you
the information about that</i>

33:53.165 --> 33:56.833
<i>so you can set it up. And you
can get in a wheelchair, right?</i>

33:56.868 --> 33:58.535
Yes.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.239
<i>Okay, they can pick you up with the
wheelchair and bring you to office, okay?</i>

34:02.273 --> 34:03.606
Okay.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.009
<i>[Dr. Now] You don't have to
be up walking the whole way,</i>

34:06.011 --> 34:09.146
<i>but if you aren't able to at
least walk around the clinic,</i>

34:09.148 --> 34:11.114
<i>then that's gonna be an issue.</i>

34:11.116 --> 34:13.116
<i>But METROLift can help you.</i>

34:13.118 --> 34:14.317
Okay.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.953
<i>I need to make sure
you're making progress</i>

34:16.955 --> 34:18.989
<i>and not gaining
your weight back.</i>

34:18.991 --> 34:21.425
<i>Are you feeling
that you lost any weight?</i>

34:21.427 --> 34:23.126
- Yes, sir.
<i>- You are looking like</i>

34:23.128 --> 34:25.128
<i>you have lost some weight.</i>

34:25.130 --> 34:27.197
<i>So that's good,
but you don't look like</i>

34:27.199 --> 34:30.167
<i>you have lost a whole lot
in two months.</i>

34:30.169 --> 34:33.136
<i>So what you have done
with your eating habit?</i>

34:33.138 --> 34:34.871
I have cut everything down.

34:34.873 --> 34:41.011
I'm... I don't eat nothing but salads,
uh, baked chicken, baked fish.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.213
I don't eat nothing...
If it don't...

34:43.215 --> 34:47.017
If it don't swim, fly,
I don't eat it.

34:47.019 --> 34:50.854
<i>How is your mother, uh,
cooperating with your eating?</i>

34:50.856 --> 34:52.889
Oh, my gosh, she's
doing good with it.

34:52.891 --> 34:55.325
She... Matter of fact, she's
even on the diet with me.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.894
All right, so she's not
over feeding you?

34:57.896 --> 35:01.098
No. No, she's not but there
is times where I'm not hungry

35:01.100 --> 35:02.799
and she tells me I have
to eat something,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.935
but that's just to keep
my nutrition up.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.271
<i>So if you're not hungry, you
can skip a meal, can't you?</i>

35:08.273 --> 35:10.240
Oh, I can skip a meal if
I'm not hungry?

35:10.508 --> 35:12.075
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:12.077 --> 35:15.278
Oh, well, thank you, 'cause we thought
we had to put three meals in every day.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.347
<i>[Dr. Now] You... You don't
have to eat three times a day,</i>

35:17.349 --> 35:20.117
<i>you can skip a meal
if you're not hungry,</i>

35:20.119 --> 35:22.052
<i>but make sure you drink plenty
of liquid.</i>

35:22.054 --> 35:23.286
<i>- Okay?
- Oh.</i>

35:23.288 --> 35:25.555
You ain't gotta worry about
that, I drink a lot of water.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.657
<i>Yeah, that'll... That'll
be fine, that'll be fine.</i>

35:27.659 --> 35:30.260
That's all I drink,
is water, water, water.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.562
<i>Good and if you
not doing anything,</i>

35:32.564 --> 35:35.265
<i>just make sure
you do some exercise, okay?</i>

35:35.533 --> 35:37.167
I do that.

35:37.235 --> 35:41.438
<i>All right, so you're going over
the instruction I gave you everyday,</i>

35:41.440 --> 35:44.841
<i>and read it and get yourself more
efficient with your eating habit?</i>

35:44.843 --> 35:47.043
Yes.

35:47.045 --> 35:51.081
<i>Okay. All right. How is your
activity and exercise doing?</i>

35:51.682 --> 35:53.350
It's doing really good, uh...

35:53.352 --> 35:56.052
I'm able to get around a lot
more when my leg's not hurting.

35:56.054 --> 36:00.757
<i>We're gonna go out and make
arrangement for you to get the transport</i>

36:00.759 --> 36:04.060
<i>to bring you to the office today
so we can check your weight</i>

36:04.062 --> 36:06.029
<i>and see how
you're getting around.</i>

36:06.031 --> 36:07.330
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

36:07.332 --> 36:10.200
<i>So we can give you the
information to call METROLift</i>

36:10.202 --> 36:12.035
<i>and they gonna be able
to bring you in,</i>

36:12.037 --> 36:15.705
<i>so you don't have to depend
on your mom to take off the work.</i>

36:15.707 --> 36:18.041
<i>- Okay?
- Okay, thank you.</i>

36:18.043 --> 36:20.277
<i>All right, and I'll see you
in a little bit.</i>

36:20.279 --> 36:22.145
<i>- Okay?
- All right, thank you, bye-bye.</i>

36:47.071 --> 36:50.173
<i>[Margaret] My appointment
with Dr. Now is today.</i>

36:50.175 --> 36:55.278
<i>After the call with Dr. Now last time,
when I missed my appointment with him,</i>

36:55.280 --> 36:58.949
<i>my mom called him back
and told him I couldn't go</i>

36:58.951 --> 37:03.353
<i>because my leg was hurting
and it was becoming infected.</i>

37:03.355 --> 37:06.656
<i>Then, Dr. Now prescribed me
some antibiotics</i>

37:06.658 --> 37:12.095
<i>and gave me more time by
rescheduling one month later.</i>

37:12.097 --> 37:15.665
<i>But he was serious that I had
to make it this time,</i>

37:15.667 --> 37:19.369
<i>and that I had to be up and
walking on my own into the clinic.</i>

37:19.371 --> 37:21.238
<i>So I've been working very hard.</i>

37:21.240 --> 37:23.440
<i>But I'm still scared though,</i>

37:23.442 --> 37:27.077
<i>to find out that I don't
qualify for weight-loss surgery.</i>

37:40.324 --> 37:41.591
Margaret?

37:43.394 --> 37:46.796
<i>[Margaret] At the hospital,
I was 685.</i>

37:46.798 --> 37:49.599
<i>Dr. Now wanted me
to lose at least 60 pounds.</i>

37:50.201 --> 37:53.336
<i>And I know I made good progress.</i>

37:53.338 --> 37:57.340
<i>So I'm hoping I'm at the 625
goal that Dr. Now wanted me at.</i>

38:03.514 --> 38:07.083
<i>But whatever my weight is,
I know I've lost a lot.</i>

38:09.220 --> 38:10.320
Come around here.

38:14.058 --> 38:17.127
Ready? One, two, three.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.097
Now, let go of Mom.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.937
- [laughs] It keeps going--
- Don't move, okay? Don't move.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.408
Your weight is 632.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.109
She's lost 100 pounds.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.078
[cheers]

38:38.149 --> 38:40.116
I knew we were eating
like rabbits.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.286
- Didn't we, Margaret?
- Oh, my God.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.688
[Millie] Isn't it worth
them rabbit eatings?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.022
Oh, my God.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.024
[kisses]

38:48.026 --> 38:51.127
Cowabunga! Give me them up!
That's it. [laughs]

38:52.463 --> 38:53.563
We did it, didn't we?

38:53.565 --> 38:55.198
Yes.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.132
Yes, we did.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.334
We got it.

38:57.336 --> 39:00.370
Okay, we're gonna be going
to room five now, okay?

39:00.372 --> 39:02.339
We gotta walk it, mama.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.574
<i>[Margaret] Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe this.</i>

39:07.778 --> 39:10.113
<i>I've never lost that much
in my life.</i>

39:12.917 --> 39:15.151
All right, let me get
on the other side of you.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.686
And I'll roll up to it.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.122
<i>I just hope that Dr. Now says
that's enough</i>

39:19.124 --> 39:20.757
<i>and I'm gonna have
weight-loss surgery.</i>

39:20.759 --> 39:23.126
[Millie] One, two, three.

39:24.295 --> 39:27.063
Let me help you get over here,
and then I'm gonna get you.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.398
Just tell me how you want me.

39:31.235 --> 39:32.635
<i>[Margaret] This is incredible.</i>

39:32.637 --> 39:35.271
<i>Dr. Now is really
a miracle worker,</i>

39:35.273 --> 39:38.007
<i>because I never thought
I'd be able to do it like this.</i>

39:39.043 --> 39:41.478
<i>This just changes everything.</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:45.248
<i>I'm gonna prove my daddy wrong
and show him I'm good at something.</i>

39:45.250 --> 39:46.416
[knock on door]

39:47.318 --> 39:48.451
Hello, how y'all doing?

39:48.453 --> 39:50.153
- [Margaret] Doing good.
- We're excited.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.921
Great.

39:51.923 --> 39:56.126
Well, Margaret, last month
I saw you on a video call.

39:56.128 --> 39:58.428
And then,
you didn't make it back in.

39:58.430 --> 40:01.831
I never thought we gonna see you
in here, so I'm glad to see you here.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.633
- Yeah.
- [Millie laughs]

40:03.635 --> 40:06.669
[Dr. Now] Even though it's been a
month since you were supposed to be here,

40:06.671 --> 40:08.671
I'm very happy you made it.

40:08.673 --> 40:12.275
And on top of that, you lost
weight and you're more mobile.

40:12.277 --> 40:15.178
So you're down to 632.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.680
So you lost 120 pounds.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.316
All right.

40:20.851 --> 40:21.985
So that's positive.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.988
But, uh, we got
a long way to go.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.258
So what I wanna do next
is talk to you

40:28.260 --> 40:30.693
going to psychotherapy
with your mom

40:30.695 --> 40:33.897
to help you to work on your
dieting a little bit more.

40:33.899 --> 40:37.000
Then, I want you to get
to work with PT,

40:37.002 --> 40:40.303
to get you a little bit more
mobile over the next month.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.305
And if you do those things,

40:42.307 --> 40:46.109
providing that you continue
losing like you have been

40:46.111 --> 40:48.545
and you stick with the program

40:48.547 --> 40:53.883
and we do some tests and see if you're
gonna be safe to do weight-loss surgery,

40:53.885 --> 40:56.319
then we're gonna, um,
approve you for that.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.254
- But all those things--
- [cries]

40:59.156 --> 41:00.256
Okay?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.295
You just made her day.

41:05.297 --> 41:09.966
I told her we'd left all the Debbie
Downers and we were gonna get this.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.702
Not the same girl you met back
at the hospital, is it?

41:15.039 --> 41:16.673
We got it baby, we got it.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.209
Oh, my God.

41:19.211 --> 41:22.245
- We've tried this so many times.
- I'd love to give you a kiss.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.681
You are my Godsend.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.516
You're gonna be one of
her first dance partners

41:26.518 --> 41:29.152
after she gets down to where
she can stand up and walk.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.086
You're my Godsend.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.322
Well,
I'm proud of your progress.

41:32.324 --> 41:37.093
And if you keep it up, we can get
you to weight loss surgery, safely.

41:37.095 --> 41:40.163
And make sure that everything
is gonna be all right for you.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.998
So keep up the good work.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.770
Don't think that you have a made it
and relax and go back to eat habits.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.138
- Oh, no! No, no, no.
- [Millie] No, no, no, no.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.242
- [Dr. Now] Okay.
- I went this far, I'm not going back.

41:52.244 --> 41:56.145
We want to be down to
200 pounds before next year.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.280
That's a good goal.

41:57.282 --> 42:00.316
And weight loss surgery
will help her do that.

42:00.318 --> 42:05.355
So, try to work on improving your
hygiene if you want your leg to improve.

42:05.357 --> 42:08.157
So keep it up.
And stick with the program.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.792
[Margaret] I'm sticking with it.

42:09.794 --> 42:12.161
- All right, I'm proud of your progress.
- Thank you.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.097
- Give me a call if you need anything.
- [Margaret] Okay.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.765
All right,
I'll see you next month.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.868
- Thank you, see you next month.
- [Millie] Yeah, yeah.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.803
I'm so excited,
I can't stand it, Margaret.

42:20.805 --> 42:24.040
- I'm so excited. Gosh, dang.
- Come here, please.

42:27.044 --> 42:31.047
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm very proud of Margaret
and Millie despite my concerns.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:36.119
When Margaret left the hospital, I
gave them the benefit of the doubt.

42:37.121 --> 42:40.123
<i>But with her resistance
to PT at home,</i>

42:40.125 --> 42:44.394
<i>and after she made excuses
and didn't show up last month,</i>

42:44.396 --> 42:48.898
I was very skeptical that she
would make the progress she needs.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.501
<i>Or that she would
ever show up again.</i>

42:51.503 --> 42:55.805
But it is a pleasant surprise
to see Margaret's progress.

42:55.807 --> 42:59.809
<i>And it shows me they are both
taking this seriously.</i>

42:59.811 --> 43:02.979
<i>But before we move ahead
with weight loss surgery,</i>

43:02.981 --> 43:07.450
<i>Margaret needs to make a little
more progress with her mobility.</i>

43:07.452 --> 43:09.752
<i>And it's important
that both of them</i>

43:09.754 --> 43:13.089
start the process of going
to psychotherapy together.

43:13.091 --> 43:19.195
<i>It's very clear that it was in the
disfunction dynamic she has with her mom</i>

43:19.197 --> 43:24.567
<i>is going to be essential to making sure
Margaret maintains her lifestyle change</i>

43:24.569 --> 43:26.202
<i>for the long term.</i>

43:26.204 --> 43:28.304
[panting]

43:30.240 --> 43:31.708
[Margaret]
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

43:32.843 --> 43:36.279
<i>I'm so excited to be getting
surgery from Dr. Now.</i>

43:37.214 --> 43:39.949
<i>And that I have this chance
to change my life.</i>

43:41.719 --> 43:44.654
<i>It's an answer to prayer
and a dream come true.</i>

43:45.723 --> 43:47.957
<i>So I'm gonna keep working
my butt off.</i>

43:52.196 --> 43:55.365
<i>I know this is my last chance
to turn my life around.</i>

43:55.367 --> 43:57.533
<i>So I'm not going to
mess this up.</i>

43:59.036 --> 44:01.504
<i>I'm a do all the things
I should be doing.</i>

44:01.506 --> 44:03.906
<i>And I'm not gonna let up,
no matter what.</i>

44:03.908 --> 44:05.508
[Millie] One, two.

44:07.244 --> 44:09.445
Got ya.

44:09.447 --> 44:12.048
<i>[Margaret] Because now I can
see the light at the end of the tunnel</i>

44:12.050 --> 44:14.317
<i>and I'm just moving faster
towards it.</i>

44:35.239 --> 44:36.673
<i>[Margaret] It has been
two weeks since</i>

44:36.675 --> 44:38.074
<i>my last appointment
with Dr. Now.</i>

44:38.076 --> 44:41.310
<i>And I've been doing
really good with my progress.</i>

44:41.312 --> 44:44.380
<i>I've been doing all my physical
therapy every time they come.</i>

44:45.082 --> 44:46.683
<i>I like Brandon, he's good.</i>

44:47.317 --> 44:49.218
- Hello?
- [dogs barking]

44:50.921 --> 44:52.088
How are you?

44:53.057 --> 44:54.424
Ready for some fun and games?

44:55.025 --> 44:56.359
All right, go ahead and sit up.

45:03.133 --> 45:05.501
[sighing in exhaustion]
Now we're up.

45:06.970 --> 45:09.872
Now, I don't want to wear out
the legs with exercise.

45:09.874 --> 45:14.010
So let's walk. Okay,
slow. Slow and controlled.

45:18.682 --> 45:21.250
You're doing great.

45:21.252 --> 45:23.453
<i>[Margaret] Walking with my
physical therapist still scares me,</i>

45:23.455 --> 45:25.521
<i>but I know he's got me.</i>

45:25.523 --> 45:27.490
<i>He's not gonna let me fall.</i>

45:27.991 --> 45:30.059
Doing great, Margaret.

45:30.061 --> 45:34.897
<i>[Margaret] I am very, very, very
determined to get back up on my feet.</i>

45:34.899 --> 45:37.033
<i>And to do it for myself.</i>

45:38.469 --> 45:42.438
<i>I know I can do this and I
have a big glimmer of hope.</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:45.675
Good job.
Very good.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.077
Great job.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.115
Now, lean forward and press up.

45:52.117 --> 45:54.117
<i>[Margaret] The only thing I
haven't had time to figure out</i>

45:54.119 --> 45:56.152
<i>is therapy for me and my mom.</i>

45:56.154 --> 45:58.121
<i>Like Dr. Now wants us to do.</i>

45:58.123 --> 46:01.324
<i>The hard part is momma has
to find time to take off from work.</i>

46:01.326 --> 46:03.993
<i>And that's gonna
take a whole day.</i>

46:03.995 --> 46:07.797
<i>So when my momma can figure out
the schedule we'll be doing that for sure.</i>

46:07.799 --> 46:09.966
<i>But that's the only thing.</i>

46:09.968 --> 46:11.801
<i>Other than that,
I've been a good girl.</i>

46:11.803 --> 46:14.937
<i>So I think this is gonna be really
good when I get in there to see Dr. Now.</i>

46:14.939 --> 46:18.341
<i>Because there's progress
I'm making for sure.</i>

46:18.343 --> 46:22.078
<i>And the best of that is I can
move a lot better, hither and yon.</i>

46:22.080 --> 46:26.082
<i>And I can't wait to show him,
because I want that surgery.</i>

46:26.084 --> 46:27.517
<i>And it's time for me to get it.</i>

46:28.218 --> 46:29.285
You made it.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.589
All right, you did great.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.460
We'll keep it up.
I'll be back on Friday.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.896
All right, ma'am you
take care. I'll be back.

46:39.898 --> 46:42.198
Keep up with
the exercises, okay?

46:42.200 --> 46:44.167
-Yes, sir. I'll see you Friday.
-Okay.

46:59.683 --> 47:00.616
Give me your hand.

47:01.885 --> 47:04.387
All right.

47:04.389 --> 47:07.056
<i>[Margaret] Today, I'm going
back to see Dr. Now at his clinic.</i>

47:09.259 --> 47:10.459
Just get behind me.

47:11.094 --> 47:12.562
Okay.

47:12.629 --> 47:16.499
<i>And I'm hoping today's the day
that I get scheduled for surgery.</i>

47:19.169 --> 47:21.204
<i>I've worked so hard
and it feels so long</i>

47:21.206 --> 47:24.073
<i>that I really think
it's gonna happen today.</i>

47:24.075 --> 47:28.377
<i>The last time I was here,
I weighed 632 pounds.</i>

47:28.379 --> 47:31.080
<i>If I was still losing
at a steady pace,</i>

47:31.082 --> 47:33.850
<i>I would have lost
another 50 pounds this month.</i>

47:33.852 --> 47:36.285
<i>That means I would have
been down to the 500's.</i>

47:36.287 --> 47:38.387
<i>And I really hope
I made it there.</i>

47:38.389 --> 47:42.024
[Millie] And we'll find out what we
are today, I hope we're in the 5's.

47:42.392 --> 47:43.559
Wouldn't that be cool?

47:44.728 --> 47:46.229
Wouldn't that be cool?

47:47.364 --> 47:50.166
But even if we're in the
low six, we don't care.

47:52.569 --> 47:54.103
But I'm betting we are.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.272
Margaret.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.007
All right.

48:09.186 --> 48:12.088
- Oh, don't dump me out!
- I'm not gonna dump you out.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.523
- I just got you through the door.
- All right.

48:17.995 --> 48:19.695
Just got to give me a second.

48:21.965 --> 48:24.367
[Millie] Once you get up there
you gotta let go.

48:24.369 --> 48:28.504
[sighing in exhaustion] Come on,
hurry, calculate. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.509
Come on, come on, come on.

48:37.514 --> 48:39.482
Your weight is 626.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.617
I didn't lose enough.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.987
Well, we're still doing good.

48:44.989 --> 48:46.022
It's fine.

48:46.024 --> 48:48.758
[panting]

48:48.760 --> 48:51.294
<i>[Margaret] I don't know what
happened or how that's right.</i>

48:56.466 --> 48:59.168
<i>I just hope Dr. Now
can be happy with what I did.</i>

48:59.403 --> 49:00.670
[Millie] I'm going.

49:00.672 --> 49:03.072
<i>[Margaret] And that
he'll see that.</i>

49:03.074 --> 49:06.042
<i>And he'll go ahead and schedule
me for weight loss surgery.</i>

49:10.113 --> 49:12.214
<i>I think I'm just having
a bad day.</i>

49:14.117 --> 49:15.885
How about that?

49:15.887 --> 49:17.486
<i>[Margaret] I'm all swolled up.</i>

49:21.224 --> 49:22.425
[knocking at door]

49:25.796 --> 49:27.363
Hello, how y'all doing?

49:27.365 --> 49:29.065
- [Millie] Okay.
- Doing pretty good.

49:29.067 --> 49:30.032
Good.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.367
Well,

49:32.269 --> 49:34.971
Margaret how's everything
going with you?

49:34.973 --> 49:36.806
I'm disappointed.

49:36.808 --> 49:40.776
Well, uh, what do you mean
you're disappointed?

49:40.778 --> 49:43.312
Cause I thought I would lose
more than what I've lost.

49:43.314 --> 49:47.249
Well, if you were
doing your part,

49:47.251 --> 49:50.019
you would have lost 50 pounds
this past month.

49:50.021 --> 49:52.288
So, it looks like you backslid.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.524
And you're still not
fully cooperating with PT.

49:55.526 --> 49:58.260
And you refused
to do psychotherapy.

49:58.262 --> 50:00.196
So, this isn't good.

50:00.198 --> 50:03.466
Because you're still 626 pounds.

50:03.468 --> 50:08.371
Your BMI today is 107.5.

50:08.373 --> 50:14.343
So, you basically, both of you,
went back to your old habits.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.312
We don't know what we did wrong.

50:16.314 --> 50:19.081
She's still eating the same way.

50:20.183 --> 50:23.119
- I mean yesterday-- - Okay,
hold on right there. Okay?

50:23.121 --> 50:25.121
- Overeating--
- [Dr. Now] Just hold on.

50:25.123 --> 50:27.156
And, like, you don't know
what is going on?

50:27.158 --> 50:30.159
There's a simple, simple math.

50:30.161 --> 50:33.029
You're eating too much,
you're not gonna lose weight.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.164
Which part of this
is very hard to understand?

50:35.166 --> 50:40.036
That she's eating at least four times
as much as what she should be eating.

50:42.239 --> 50:46.142
So, why we overeating and playing
like we don't know what's going on?

50:46.144 --> 50:48.978
But she didn't overeat.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.347
- She's still eating the same-- -
You want to argue that with the scale?

50:51.349 --> 50:53.215
Don't argue with me.

50:53.217 --> 50:55.051
- But she didn't overeat.
- You argue that with the scale.

50:55.053 --> 50:58.320
She couldn't overeat
I gave her proportioned meals.

50:58.322 --> 51:01.057
And it's the same
as I've always given her.

51:01.059 --> 51:05.061
The only thing that we know
that might have been different

51:05.063 --> 51:10.099
is she quit eating the vinaigrette
and ate honey mustard dressing.

51:10.101 --> 51:13.269
Is she eat, what,
a gallon of honey mustard?

51:13.271 --> 51:16.038
Now, I don't know how much
she put on her salad.

51:16.040 --> 51:20.342
- [Margaret] The two cups.
- But I can tell you that's the only difference.

51:20.344 --> 51:22.978
So she's gaining
from thin air, right?

51:22.980 --> 51:24.880
[Millie] Well, I don't know
how she done it.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.048
This is what I know.

51:26.050 --> 51:27.883
Now, I'm the one
who fixes her meals.

51:27.885 --> 51:31.153
- And unless she's getting up when I'm not there.
- No.

51:31.155 --> 51:34.023
I'm not getting up
and I promise you that.

51:34.025 --> 51:37.393
I don't know what
went wrong, I don't know.

51:37.395 --> 51:40.463
- Did you quit exercising during the day?
- No.

51:42.866 --> 51:46.669
For her to be 600 pounds
and keep that 600 pounds,

51:46.671 --> 51:49.605
she's eating
5,000-6,000 calories a day.

51:50.207 --> 51:54.143
If she eat a 1,000
or 1,200 calorie

51:54.145 --> 51:56.345
she gonna lose 100 pounds
in one month.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.314
Okay?

51:58.316 --> 52:00.549
And don't come and tell me
what you're eating.

52:00.551 --> 52:03.752
You want to argue all that
with the scale? Be my guest.

52:03.754 --> 52:04.853
Okay?

52:04.855 --> 52:07.590
If she's not losing weight,
she's eating too much.

52:07.592 --> 52:11.660
You know, she's eating the food that
belongs next five years ahead of time.

52:13.830 --> 52:17.032
Unless you drink your shake in the
morning and you drink a shake at night,

52:17.034 --> 52:19.201
and that's only
300 calories a day.

52:19.203 --> 52:22.571
Who said she should
be drinking a shake?

52:22.573 --> 52:24.673
You are the enabler
in that house.

52:24.675 --> 52:27.343
- You are telling her something that is not correct.
- [Millie] A protein shake.

52:27.345 --> 52:29.111
Well, who said protein shake

52:29.113 --> 52:31.814
- was okay to drink?
- [Millie] Nobody.

52:31.816 --> 52:35.251
So between you two, whatever
is going on, we're killing her.

52:35.253 --> 52:39.889
And if you don't go to therapy and do
what you need, and take this seriously,

52:39.891 --> 52:44.160
my bet is you come in next month
you probably gain some weight.

52:44.162 --> 52:47.863
- [Millie] We didn't even do a month before we came here.
- And give me the same story

52:47.865 --> 52:49.665
that you're not eating
very much,

52:49.667 --> 52:55.237
and between you two, you know, was
maybe honey mustard, and, you know.

52:55.239 --> 52:56.906
I don't want to hear excuses.

52:56.908 --> 52:58.374
I don't want to see the tears.

52:58.376 --> 53:01.744
I don't want to see
any drama in here.

53:01.746 --> 53:03.946
That we don't know
what's going on

53:03.948 --> 53:07.349
and all these stories
that none of it is believable.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.219
So, from here it is simple.

53:10.221 --> 53:13.389
I want you to lose 35 pounds
by next month.

53:13.391 --> 53:15.891
And start seeing psychotherapy.

53:15.893 --> 53:20.963
If not, then we are not
moving ahead with you.

53:20.965 --> 53:24.333
Just because we did not lose it
Margaret, does not mean we can't--

53:24.335 --> 53:26.635
I want to go home.

53:30.073 --> 53:33.475
That's all I want. I just want
out of this office and go home.

53:40.984 --> 53:43.652
Try harder.
You can do it.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.088
Like you're mom said.

53:46.155 --> 53:47.089
Okay?

53:47.156 --> 53:50.059
We have faith that
you can do this, Margaret.

53:50.061 --> 53:54.330
- We're not quitting.
- And you quit, you're never gonna make it.

53:54.332 --> 53:55.965
Okay?

53:55.967 --> 53:59.001
We're gonna get on this horse and
we're gonna do what Dr. Now says.

53:59.003 --> 54:03.739
All right, if you need
anything, give me a call.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.374
- Sure will.
- All right.

54:09.613 --> 54:11.847
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm obviously
disappointed</i>

54:11.849 --> 54:16.185
<i>from what I see from Margaret
and Millie's choices this past month.</i>

54:16.187 --> 54:21.156
There are elements where
Millie tells Margaret positive things.

54:21.158 --> 54:24.660
<i>And pushes her to keep going
and not quit.</i>

54:24.662 --> 54:26.295
<i>But those are all cliches.</i>

54:26.297 --> 54:28.197
<i>What matters is action.</i>

54:28.199 --> 54:33.669
And it is very dangerous when you have
a dynamic where someone talk's the talk,

54:33.671 --> 54:37.973
<i>but doesn't support it with
any of the choices they make.</i>

54:37.975 --> 54:42.645
I have no doubt that Millie loves
Margaret and wants the best for her.

54:42.647 --> 54:46.815
<i>She talks supporting then
contradicts that with her actions.</i>

54:46.817 --> 54:50.085
<i>So whatever progress they have
will be short-lived.</i>

54:50.087 --> 54:52.821
<i>And unless they both
start that process,</i>

54:52.823 --> 54:55.324
<i>we won't be moving ahead
with Margaret.</i>

54:56.092 --> 54:57.960
[Margaret]
<i>I was disappointed.</i>

54:59.029 --> 55:00.296
<i>Let down.</i>

55:02.232 --> 55:04.333
<i>Because I thought I did better
than what I did.</i>

55:05.268 --> 55:09.204
<i>I'm angry at myself
cause I could have did better.</i>

55:09.206 --> 55:12.341
<i>Just disappointed.
[heavy sigh]</i>

55:13.576 --> 55:15.311
<i>But don't give up.</i>

55:17.347 --> 55:20.082
<i>You'll have your
disappointments, but don't give up.</i>

55:40.904 --> 55:43.605
Here, wash your face down.

55:44.140 --> 55:46.475
Make ya feel better.
Get you started.

55:48.144 --> 55:51.013
<i>[Margaret] It's been a week
since my appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

55:51.015 --> 55:53.148
<i>Since then,
me and my mom has talked,</i>

55:53.150 --> 55:58.153
<i>and decided that surgery is the most
important thing that could happen in my life.</i>

55:58.155 --> 56:00.189
- Through with the wash rag?
- Yeah, I just threw it there.

56:00.191 --> 56:01.690
Okay.

56:01.692 --> 56:04.193
<i>[Margaret] So we told Dr. Now
we would do therapy.</i>

56:07.097 --> 56:08.297
- [knocking at door]
- [dogs barking]

56:09.366 --> 56:12.301
All right, get back.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.905
- [Paradise] Hi there, I'm Dr. Paradise.
- Hello.

56:16.907 --> 56:19.041
- I'm Millie, I'm Margaret's mom.
- [Paradise] Hi, Millie.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.176
Would you like to sit
over here where she's at?

56:22.112 --> 56:24.546
[Paradise] You have a
lot of protectors, don't you?

56:24.548 --> 56:26.515
- [Margaret] Yes, sir.
- [Millie] All right!

56:26.517 --> 56:28.283
All right, enough!

56:30.086 --> 56:31.286
Enough!

56:32.655 --> 56:34.390
They don't bite.
They're all friendly.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.425
- I'm Millie and this is Margaret.
- Millie and Margaret, okay.

56:36.427 --> 56:39.461
-I'm Mom.
-Good. Hi, Mom. Good to meet you.

56:39.463 --> 56:41.964
So, Margaret,
I'm glad to see you.

56:41.966 --> 56:44.566
Um, thanks for having me
in your house.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.102
Tell me about growing up in
your house. What was it like?

56:48.271 --> 56:49.471
Hell.

56:52.842 --> 56:55.110
You're getting sad pretty
quick talking about that.

56:55.845 --> 56:56.578
[Millie] We got this.

56:57.881 --> 56:58.580
Give me your hand.

57:00.016 --> 57:01.283
We got this.

57:01.285 --> 57:03.285
We've got to heal now,
do we not?

57:04.487 --> 57:07.956
So you had a tough childhood.

57:07.958 --> 57:10.526
So tough that you
can't even talk about it.

57:11.127 --> 57:13.061
When did you start getting big?

57:15.031 --> 57:18.400
[Millie] She was about...
In kindergarten she was big.

57:18.402 --> 57:20.068
I was bullied.

57:20.870 --> 57:22.638
Okay. Who protected you?

57:23.373 --> 57:25.474
I didn't have anybody
to protect me.

57:26.709 --> 57:29.144
You know, I get the sense
that your mom protects you,

57:29.146 --> 57:32.915
even in just a couple minutes
talking together,

57:32.917 --> 57:34.917
your mom steps in
and says stuff.

57:34.919 --> 57:36.685
She wasn't there.

57:36.687 --> 57:38.187
- What do you--
- [Millie] I had to work.

57:38.189 --> 57:40.923
Did you work all the way
through her growing up?

57:40.925 --> 57:41.990
- [Millie] Yes. I still work.
- Okay.

57:41.992 --> 57:43.926
- You still work now.
- Yes.

57:43.928 --> 57:46.028
What is... Margaret's
by herself during the day?

57:46.030 --> 57:48.096
- Yes.
- [Millie] Okay.

57:48.098 --> 57:51.033
Um, how do you do when
you're by yourself, Margaret?

57:51.035 --> 57:53.802
I talk to her on the phone
while she's a work.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.971
So you talk to each other
all day on the phone?

57:55.973 --> 58:00.275
[Millie] Yes, we may have a
seven-eight hour [laughs] phone call.

58:00.277 --> 58:03.278
- It sounds like you were a very active mother.
- [Millie] Yes.

58:03.280 --> 58:05.447
- My babies are my world.
- [Paradise] Right.

58:06.082 --> 58:07.149
She's not a baby.

58:07.383 --> 58:08.383
She's my baby.

58:08.385 --> 58:10.252
She's your baby and she's 35.

58:10.254 --> 58:13.922
She's still my baby.
She'll always be my baby.

58:13.924 --> 58:17.159
You know, the word "baby"
implies a lot of care.

58:18.027 --> 58:20.095
She's my baby,
she's the youngest.

58:20.097 --> 58:22.331
[Paradise] I'm a little
worried... So yeah, I...

58:22.333 --> 58:25.100
You know, I don't know you very
well Margaret, we just started talking.

58:25.102 --> 58:30.038
But I think that's gonna be my theme
with you, is making you not a baby.

58:30.040 --> 58:33.876
I think you must believe that
the world is a dangerous place.

58:33.878 --> 58:36.979
- It is, and I'm scared-- -
[Millie] We don't trust nobody.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.881
- [Dr. Paradise] And that,
and that-- - I don't let nobody in.

58:38.883 --> 58:40.315
And that people
will hurt you, right?

58:40.317 --> 58:41.750
They'll hurt me.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.752
- That's the thing.
- [Millie] And we have a trust issue.

58:43.754 --> 58:45.954
- I have to say, cause I'm there too.
- I have trust issues.

58:45.956 --> 58:50.993
That's why I become her
comfort zone. Her security blanket.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.461
And I know
you've been doing it forever.

58:52.463 --> 58:56.298
But I'm gonna push you guys to
be a little bit more independent.

58:56.900 --> 58:57.866
- And, and--
- All right.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.167
[Margaret] How do you do that?

58:59.169 --> 59:00.635
You practice.

59:00.637 --> 59:04.406
I want you guys to practice more and
more times of independence for her.

59:04.408 --> 59:06.308
And you get to step back.

59:06.310 --> 59:08.677
And you get to
attend to your job,

59:08.679 --> 59:11.880
and your relationships, and you're
always gonna be there for her.

59:11.882 --> 59:15.050
But you're gonna be there
for her in a way that's healthy

59:15.052 --> 59:17.886
and appropriate
for a 35-year-old woman.

59:17.888 --> 59:20.656
[Margaret] So more or less you're saying
[voice breaks] that I don't need her.

59:20.658 --> 59:21.857
- No.
- [Millie] No, Margaret.

59:21.859 --> 59:24.092
He's not saying
that you don't need me.

59:24.094 --> 59:27.296
- He's more of less saying that my comfort zone is gone.
- He's saying...

59:27.298 --> 59:29.097
Margaret, you will always--

59:29.099 --> 59:30.799
[Margaret] I need to let go
of my comfort zone.

59:30.801 --> 59:32.801
[Millie] He's not saying
you need to let go of me.

59:32.803 --> 59:36.171
Let's take the food from her,
so that's a comfort zone gone.

59:36.173 --> 59:38.240
Okay, now let's take
the mother away from her,

59:38.242 --> 59:40.008
that's another
comfort zone gone.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.209
Maybe we'll just
keep breaking her,

59:41.211 --> 59:42.878
- and breaking her, and breaking her.
- [Mille] Margaret.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.013
Margaret, your mother
can be very present.

59:45.015 --> 59:46.682
I'm just, I'm done.
[crying]

59:46.684 --> 59:49.251
-I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
-[Millie] We're a team. We're a team.

59:49.253 --> 59:52.421
I'm always gonna love you.
Give me a team.

59:52.423 --> 59:56.858
Millie, Millie, do you notice in
this moment that you're jumping in?

59:56.860 --> 1:00:00.796
Because I know how stressful
she is and it is a meltdown.

1:00:00.798 --> 1:00:03.765
And she will
want to resort to food.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:08.003
And here's an opportunity,
even in this little tiny moment.

1:00:08.005 --> 1:00:09.438
We're gonna let her
have her feelings,

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:12.107
'cause I think she's capable
of working through this.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.209
[yelling] You don't know me!

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:16.244
[crying continues]

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:18.113
See the resistance?

1:00:18.115 --> 1:00:21.883
Just get out of my house, just
go, just go, get out of my house.

1:00:21.885 --> 1:00:24.186
I'm done.

1:00:24.188 --> 1:00:27.656
-He's not saying Margaret that I'm
abandoning you -I'm done. I'm done.

1:00:27.658 --> 1:00:30.959
It's interesting she's
getting up in response to this.

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:37.165
Isn't it neat that she's getting
out of bed in response to this?

1:00:37.167 --> 1:00:39.368
But I want you to notice
the urge, right now,

1:00:39.370 --> 1:00:41.436
that you have to jump in
and comfort her.

1:00:41.438 --> 1:00:42.838
- And I--
- That's my job.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.240
I think of her
as a grown up adult.

1:00:45.242 --> 1:00:48.977
And we've gotta
let her self soothe.

1:00:48.979 --> 1:00:51.079
Work on this on her own, in
order for her to realize that.

1:00:51.081 --> 1:00:55.717
The solution is to, um...
to watch her

1:00:55.719 --> 1:00:57.953
- take care of herself.
- [Millie] Margaret, do you want your walker?

1:00:57.955 --> 1:01:01.056
Margaret, please, do not
try to walk without nothing.

1:01:03.126 --> 1:01:04.559
She's trying to get away
from y'all.

1:01:04.561 --> 1:01:06.161
Okay.

1:01:06.163 --> 1:01:09.898
But again, I want you to watch she's
doing this without anybody's help.

1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:13.301
I want her to go in and feel
her feelings and be okay.

1:01:13.303 --> 1:01:15.937
She's a grown up. She's
gonna go deal with her feelings.

1:01:15.939 --> 1:01:17.406
She's gonna come out
in a couple hours

1:01:17.408 --> 1:01:20.342
and I'm sure you guys will
have a fine time after that.

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:21.977
And I think this is really good.

1:01:21.979 --> 1:01:23.211
This is the push
and pull, right?

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:26.648
You may see that as really
negative, I'm proud of her.

1:01:26.650 --> 1:01:28.950
- She basically said--
- I'm proud of her, in a way.

1:01:28.952 --> 1:01:30.919
But I've seen the setbacks.

1:01:30.921 --> 1:01:32.354
I don't think
this is a setback at all,

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:33.355
I think this is a breakthrough.

1:01:33.357 --> 1:01:35.557
She just stuck up for herself.

1:01:35.559 --> 1:01:38.527
Somebody pushing her
and she got space from it.

1:01:54.644 --> 1:01:57.846
<i>[Margaret] It's been a week since
my appointment with Dr. Paradise.</i>

1:01:57.848 --> 1:02:01.750
<i>I've been trying to think
about what he told me to do.</i>

1:02:01.752 --> 1:02:05.554
<i>It's been really hard because I'm
scared of facing this world alone.</i>

1:02:08.124 --> 1:02:12.961
<i>But today I'm gonna try and do some of
the homework that Dr. Paradise gave me.</i>

1:02:12.963 --> 1:02:15.797
<i>He told me it would be
a big improvement,</i>

1:02:15.799 --> 1:02:18.600
<i>if I could go longer
and longer amounts of time</i>

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:21.036
<i>without needing to call
my momma on the phone.</i>

1:02:26.275 --> 1:02:29.344
<i>And today's gonna be a
good day for me to try that out,</i>

1:02:29.346 --> 1:02:31.580
<i>because she's got
a new schedule.</i>

1:02:33.282 --> 1:02:36.051
<i>So she ain't gonna be home
in time for dinner.</i>

1:02:36.053 --> 1:02:38.453
<i>And that scares me,
but I'm gonna give it a try.</i>

1:02:40.356 --> 1:02:43.125
<i>I know it's life or death
for me to lose this weight.</i>

1:02:43.127 --> 1:02:45.861
<i>So I'm trying it,
even if I don't like it.</i>

1:02:45.863 --> 1:02:49.097
<i>Because I'm going back
to see Dr. Now in a few weeks.</i>

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:52.300
<i>And I don't want the appointment
to go like it did last time.</i>

1:02:52.302 --> 1:02:55.103
<i>I intend on getting approved
for surgery.</i>

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:58.006
<i>So if I've gotta go outside
my comfort zone, I'll do it.</i>

1:02:58.008 --> 1:03:00.142
<i>Because I know my future
depends on it.</i>

1:03:16.659 --> 1:03:19.094
I'm really dizzy today.

1:03:19.096 --> 1:03:20.428
[panting and straining]

1:03:20.430 --> 1:03:21.963
You got it.

1:03:22.999 --> 1:03:24.933
Have we not?

1:03:24.935 --> 1:03:26.768
<i>[Margaret] I'm nervous
about today,</i>

1:03:26.770 --> 1:03:28.336
<i>and how it's gonna go.</i>

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:32.073
[Millie] Well, don't
scoot it up too much,

1:03:32.075 --> 1:03:32.941
I gotta shut the door.

1:03:32.943 --> 1:03:34.142
<i>[Margaret] And I know</i>

1:03:34.144 --> 1:03:36.178
<i>what it feels like
to get my hopes up about it,</i>

1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:39.481
<i>and then be disappointed
if I didn't reach my goals.</i>

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:41.516
I gotta open the door.

1:03:44.353 --> 1:03:45.954
<i>[Margaret] So I've been
working extra,</i>

1:03:45.956 --> 1:03:48.089
<i>trying my hardest
to do everything I can</i>

1:03:48.091 --> 1:03:50.158
<i>to make sure
it goes better this time.</i>

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:52.627
<i>'Cause right now, Dr. Now
will get fed up with me.</i>

1:03:56.065 --> 1:03:57.365
Margaret?

1:04:15.051 --> 1:04:16.551
So that you can get up.

1:04:16.553 --> 1:04:18.119
You're not
supposed to be scared.

1:04:18.121 --> 1:04:19.354
Foot.

1:04:25.328 --> 1:04:28.196
<i>At my last appointment,
I was 626,</i>

1:04:28.198 --> 1:04:31.166
<i>and I was supposed to lose
35 pounds in a month.</i>

1:04:31.168 --> 1:04:34.603
<i>So if I did that, the number
I need to see is 591.</i>

1:04:38.441 --> 1:04:39.541
I'm on it.

1:04:45.414 --> 1:04:47.115
Okay, can I get off?

1:04:48.084 --> 1:04:49.417
[softly] Wait, wait.

1:04:50.286 --> 1:04:53.121
Momma, get that wheelchair.

1:04:54.490 --> 1:04:57.058
<i>Oh my, oh my goodness.</i>

1:04:57.060 --> 1:04:59.127
<i>I did it, I did it.</i>

1:04:59.129 --> 1:05:01.196
[nurse] We're gonna go
to room five, okay?

1:05:01.198 --> 1:05:05.233
<i>[Margaret] That's pretty
close. I really hope it is.</i>

1:05:09.138 --> 1:05:11.306
<i>I hope Dr. Now says it's okay.</i>

1:05:11.308 --> 1:05:13.341
<i>I'm only four pounds off.</i>

1:05:13.343 --> 1:05:15.877
<i>Oh, boy, I sure hope
he says that's okay.</i>

1:05:15.879 --> 1:05:18.580
<i>I feel proud of myself
for that weight loss.</i>

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:21.516
<i>I'll be devastated if Dr. Now
is not happy with that.</i>

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.266
[knock on door]

1:05:41.237 --> 1:05:42.504
Hello, how you all doing?

1:05:42.506 --> 1:05:44.739
Doing good, you?

1:05:44.741 --> 1:05:46.074
Good.

1:05:46.076 --> 1:05:48.543
All right, Margaret,
how you getting along?

1:05:49.211 --> 1:05:50.278
I'm doing really good.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:51.346
I can see that.

1:05:51.348 --> 1:05:53.381
You're finally under 600,

1:05:53.383 --> 1:05:55.884
- so how does that feel?
- [Margaret] It feels great.

1:05:55.886 --> 1:05:58.353
[Dr. Now] So, are you
getting around easier,

1:05:58.355 --> 1:05:59.688
and your stamina getting better?

1:05:59.690 --> 1:06:01.389
- Yes.
- All right.

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:04.392
We've got her showers down to
in about 30 minutes time,

1:06:04.394 --> 1:06:06.628
and that's getting up,
out of the bed,

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:08.797
walking into the bathroom,
getting in the shower,

1:06:08.799 --> 1:06:11.333
and getting back out and getting
back in bed, about 30 minutes.

1:06:11.335 --> 1:06:14.369
Where it used to take us
probably an hour and a half.

1:06:14.371 --> 1:06:17.138
Okay, well, you're making
some improvement, though.

1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:18.673
And she fits in
this wheelchair now,

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:20.141
and this is your wheelchair.

1:06:20.143 --> 1:06:23.078
[Dr. Now] Okay. So going in
the right direction.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:24.879
So, what are you doing different

1:06:24.881 --> 1:06:26.181
with your eating habits?

1:06:26.183 --> 1:06:28.016
I'm not eating. [chuckles]

1:06:28.018 --> 1:06:29.184
You're what?

1:06:29.186 --> 1:06:30.885
I'm not eating.

1:06:30.887 --> 1:06:33.888
[chuckles] It might be
three or four o'clock

1:06:33.890 --> 1:06:36.024
in the afternoon
before I finally do eat.

1:06:36.026 --> 1:06:37.993
[Millie and Margaret] And it's
a salad.

1:06:37.995 --> 1:06:40.028
[Millie and Margaret]
With no dressing.

1:06:41.130 --> 1:06:44.733
Well, you lost 31 pounds,

1:06:44.735 --> 1:06:46.334
- so this is...
- In 14 days.

1:06:46.336 --> 1:06:49.371
It's not a whole lot of weight
lost when you are 600 pounds.

1:06:49.373 --> 1:06:50.505
So what do you mean?

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:52.307
You maybe think
you're not eating,

1:06:52.309 --> 1:06:53.375
but you're still eating.

1:06:53.377 --> 1:06:54.943
Well, like I said, I'm just...

1:06:54.945 --> 1:06:57.178
It's three or four o'clock
in the afternoon before I eat,

1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:01.416
and it's salad with
just a handful of protein.

1:07:01.418 --> 1:07:05.086
It's mostly salad. It's mostly
lettuce and tomatoes and...

1:07:05.088 --> 1:07:06.755
[Millie] It's not even
an ounce and a half

1:07:06.757 --> 1:07:09.190
of baked chicken.

1:07:09.192 --> 1:07:13.261
So, what do you call
a handful of protein?

1:07:13.263 --> 1:07:17.365
That's what, I weigh it out.
It's about an ounce of...

1:07:17.367 --> 1:07:18.333
'Cause I weight it up,

1:07:18.335 --> 1:07:20.468
it's an ounce of baked chicken.

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:24.672
Okay, and what are you drinking?

1:07:24.674 --> 1:07:25.974
Water.

1:07:25.976 --> 1:07:27.308
Okay.

1:07:27.310 --> 1:07:30.011
I will not go
from anything but water.

1:07:30.013 --> 1:07:32.147
All right.
If all that is accurate,

1:07:32.149 --> 1:07:33.314
you would have lost

1:07:33.316 --> 1:07:34.949
two to three times what you did.

1:07:34.951 --> 1:07:37.919
So you're still eating
more than you realize.

1:07:37.921 --> 1:07:39.220
But you're making some progress.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:42.190
But let's tighten up
a little bit more, okay?

1:07:42.192 --> 1:07:43.958
- You're taking the vitamins?
- Yes.

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:45.126
[Dr. Now] Okay.

1:07:45.128 --> 1:07:48.063
I used to be all about carbs.
All about carbs.

1:07:48.998 --> 1:07:51.166
I don't care
about carbs no more!

1:07:51.168 --> 1:07:54.002
- Good.
- [Margaret] I don't want them.

1:07:54.004 --> 1:07:56.471
I've learned that
the carbs and sugars

1:07:56.473 --> 1:07:58.006
is what makes you
gain the weight.

1:07:58.008 --> 1:07:59.140
I don't want that no more.

1:07:59.142 --> 1:08:01.042
[Millie] We dropped
the carbs, the fat,

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:02.944
and the sugar.

1:08:02.946 --> 1:08:05.146
I don't need that
in my life no more.

1:08:05.148 --> 1:08:07.449
At least we are on
the right track now.

1:08:07.451 --> 1:08:10.985
We just need to keep pushing,
and go harder.

1:08:10.987 --> 1:08:12.253
And the most important thing is

1:08:12.255 --> 1:08:14.322
that you both
started psychotherapy.

1:08:14.324 --> 1:08:17.192
So I'm proud of
both of you for that.

1:08:17.194 --> 1:08:18.793
Okay, thank you.

1:08:18.795 --> 1:08:20.862
So, with all
your progress, Margaret,

1:08:20.864 --> 1:08:24.265
I'm willing to schedule you
for endoscopy in one month.

1:08:24.267 --> 1:08:26.000
You've still got
a long way to go.

1:08:26.002 --> 1:08:28.036
Stay focused and don't give up.

1:08:28.038 --> 1:08:30.238
And if you lose
another 30 pounds

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:32.874
and keep doing
the psychotherapy and PT,

1:08:32.876 --> 1:08:36.778
and if everything looks good
in your endoscopy and tests,

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.513
then I will schedule you

1:08:38.515 --> 1:08:40.682
for weight loss surgery
at that point.

1:08:40.684 --> 1:08:41.816
Yes, sir.

1:08:41.818 --> 1:08:44.185
Okay. So, have
a positive attitude

1:08:44.187 --> 1:08:47.122
and work hard, and you're
gonna get there, okay?

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:49.224
All righty.
Thank you, Dr. Now.

1:08:49.226 --> 1:08:51.126
- All right, bye.
- [Margaret] All right.

1:08:56.165 --> 1:08:58.433
We got that one.

1:08:58.435 --> 1:09:00.935
I'm happy to see that
Margaret and Millie

1:09:00.937 --> 1:09:03.037
<i>have gotten back on the wagon,</i>

1:09:03.039 --> 1:09:05.740
<i>and that they both
have started psychotherapy.</i>

1:09:05.742 --> 1:09:08.243
That may be helping them
turn things around.

1:09:08.245 --> 1:09:10.445
<i>But they both will need
to stick with that</i>

1:09:10.447 --> 1:09:13.148
<i>if they expect to make
any of these changes.</i>

1:09:13.150 --> 1:09:14.916
<i>And before I feel like</i>

1:09:14.918 --> 1:09:16.918
<i>Margaret is ready to move ahead,</i>

1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:20.321
I need to see a little more
consistency from her.

1:09:20.323 --> 1:09:23.958
<i>So if she keeps moving
in the right direction,</i>

1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:25.059
<i>doing what she needs,</i>

1:09:25.061 --> 1:09:28.730
<i>by going to psychotherapy
and sticking to her PT,</i>

1:09:28.732 --> 1:09:32.534
<i>and then loses another
30 pounds by her endoscopy,</i>

1:09:32.536 --> 1:09:36.404
we will move ahead and do
weight loss surgery on her.

1:09:36.406 --> 1:09:39.140
<i>So, we'll see
how she's doing next month</i>

1:09:39.142 --> 1:09:40.508
<i>and go from there.</i>

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:42.644
<i>But right now, I'm encouraged</i>

1:09:42.646 --> 1:09:45.680
by what I'm seeing
from both her and Millie.

1:09:46.682 --> 1:09:48.650
<i>[Margaret] I'm so happy
and excited</i>

1:09:48.652 --> 1:09:50.185
<i>to move forward like this.</i>

1:09:50.187 --> 1:09:53.955
<i>It feels like I'm so close.
I'm almost there.</i>

1:09:53.957 --> 1:09:56.691
<i>There's no way in no hell
I'm gonna stop trying now.</i>

1:09:56.693 --> 1:09:58.459
<i>Not now and not ever.</i>

1:09:58.461 --> 1:10:00.195
<i>I'm gonna make
Momma and Dr. Now proud</i>

1:10:00.197 --> 1:10:01.462
<i>for sticking with me.</i>

1:10:01.464 --> 1:10:03.731
<i>'Cause I still got
a lot to live yet.</i>

1:10:03.733 --> 1:10:05.333
<i>Just you wait and see.</i>

1:10:18.414 --> 1:10:20.682
<i>I'm here at the hospital
for my endoscopy,</i>

1:10:20.684 --> 1:10:22.383
<i>so Dr. Now can look
down in my stomach.</i>

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:23.851
<i>'Cause here lately
I've been feeling</i>

1:10:23.853 --> 1:10:25.119
<i>a lot of pain in my stomach.</i>

1:10:25.121 --> 1:10:27.322
<i>At first, I thought it was
just because I was hungry.</i>

1:10:27.324 --> 1:10:29.557
<i>But Doc says
it might be something else,</i>

1:10:29.559 --> 1:10:31.426
<i>and that he better check it out,</i>

1:10:31.428 --> 1:10:34.896
<i>and to find out if I'm going
to be fit to get the surgery.</i>

1:10:34.898 --> 1:10:36.064
[choked up] We're gonna
get this done.

1:10:36.066 --> 1:10:37.932
[Millie] Yes, we are.

1:10:37.934 --> 1:10:40.368
But promise me you'll be here
when I wake up.

1:10:40.370 --> 1:10:42.570
Yes, Margaret,
I am not gonna leave you.

1:10:43.072 --> 1:10:44.639
Have I left you?

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:48.476
I keep telling you,
when I left your daddy,

1:10:48.478 --> 1:10:52.313
it was I left your daddy,
I didn't leave you.

1:10:53.048 --> 1:10:54.115
Look at me.

1:10:54.117 --> 1:10:55.216
Who did I leave?

1:10:55.218 --> 1:10:56.484
Dad.

1:10:56.486 --> 1:11:00.054
I didn't leave you. You had
a choice to go, did you not?

1:11:02.258 --> 1:11:04.425
- Yeah.
- I don't leave my kids.

1:11:04.427 --> 1:11:08.363
And I will be here
when you wake up.

1:11:09.798 --> 1:11:11.299
Uh-uh.

1:11:11.301 --> 1:11:13.635
Have I not been with you
every step of the way?

1:11:16.572 --> 1:11:18.406
So why would I stop now?

1:11:20.876 --> 1:11:21.876
Quit them tears.

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:24.279
It's gonna be okay.

1:11:25.914 --> 1:11:27.982
I'm gonna be sitting right here

1:11:27.984 --> 1:11:29.484
waiting on you
when you come back.

1:11:32.254 --> 1:11:33.454
Got it?

1:11:37.259 --> 1:11:39.193
[Millie] Where am I gonna be
when you wake up?

1:11:39.195 --> 1:11:40.295
Right here.

1:11:41.263 --> 1:11:42.563
[Millie] I'm not going anywhere.

1:11:42.565 --> 1:11:44.599
Ah, don't start your bawling.

1:11:46.435 --> 1:11:47.969
We got this.

1:11:55.644 --> 1:11:56.944
Love you.

1:11:56.946 --> 1:11:58.112
I love you.

1:11:59.982 --> 1:12:01.282
[Millie] Get back here.

1:12:02.084 --> 1:12:04.886
Today, we're gonna do
an endoscopy on Margaret

1:12:04.888 --> 1:12:06.387
<i>to make sure there are no issues</i>

1:12:06.389 --> 1:12:08.189
<i>that would prevent us</i>

1:12:08.191 --> 1:12:10.024
<i>from doing weight loss surgery
on her.</i>

1:12:10.026 --> 1:12:12.527
<i>She started working
with psychotherapy,</i>

1:12:12.529 --> 1:12:14.896
<i>which was the big step
I wanted her to take.</i>

1:12:14.898 --> 1:12:17.332
<i>So because of all that,</i>

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:19.867
<i>and the fact that she hasn't
started gaining weight,</i>

1:12:19.869 --> 1:12:21.836
and she's working
with physical therapy

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:22.970
off and on now,

1:12:22.972 --> 1:12:25.940
<i>I am willing to start
the process with her</i>

1:12:25.942 --> 1:12:27.108
<i>to do weight loss surgery,</i>

1:12:27.110 --> 1:12:28.843
<i>starting with the testing.</i>

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:32.113
<i>She has been complaining
of stomach pain recently,</i>

1:12:32.115 --> 1:12:34.282
<i>so the priority is figuring out</i>

1:12:34.284 --> 1:12:36.351
what could be causing that,

1:12:36.353 --> 1:12:40.054
<i>and see if there is something
we need to address with her</i>

1:12:40.056 --> 1:12:42.123
<i>before we move ahead
with anything.</i>

1:12:42.125 --> 1:12:44.292
All right, we can go now.

1:12:51.166 --> 1:12:53.000
[woman speaking]

1:12:53.235 --> 1:12:54.602
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:12:57.106 --> 1:12:59.374
[Dr. Now] We're gonna begin
the endoscopy.

1:12:59.376 --> 1:13:02.377
We're using the camera,
go into her esophagus

1:13:02.379 --> 1:13:04.145
and looking at her stomach.

1:13:07.116 --> 1:13:08.349
Open.

1:13:13.989 --> 1:13:16.157
We got a very huge stomach.

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:17.525
Very big stomach.

1:13:17.527 --> 1:13:20.695
And everything for
the most part looking good.

1:13:20.697 --> 1:13:23.231
The opening of that
does look good.

1:13:23.233 --> 1:13:26.000
The rest of it looks good.

1:13:26.002 --> 1:13:28.336
So she does not have a hernia.

1:13:28.338 --> 1:13:30.671
But she has a big stomach.

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:34.108
Okay, everything looks good,

1:13:34.110 --> 1:13:36.277
so we're gonna remove the scope.

1:13:38.313 --> 1:13:40.548
All right, well done.

1:13:46.855 --> 1:13:48.523
Ooh, time to lie down.

1:13:54.096 --> 1:13:56.063
All right, you're looking great.

1:14:02.471 --> 1:14:04.338
How's everything?

1:14:10.112 --> 1:14:11.179
Hey, Margaret.

1:14:11.181 --> 1:14:12.380
Are you awake?

1:14:13.182 --> 1:14:16.017
All right, your endoscopy
looked good.

1:14:16.019 --> 1:14:17.685
- [Margaret] Oh, that's good.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

1:14:17.687 --> 1:14:19.854
So, everything looked good,

1:14:19.856 --> 1:14:22.290
except you got some gall stones.

1:14:22.292 --> 1:14:25.226
That looks to be the issue
behind your stomach pain.

1:14:25.228 --> 1:14:27.328
And probably that triggers

1:14:27.330 --> 1:14:29.931
some nausea and abdominal pain.

1:14:29.933 --> 1:14:32.333
Just take it easy
in what you're eating

1:14:32.335 --> 1:14:34.902
to help minimize any discomfort,

1:14:34.904 --> 1:14:36.838
and we will address that for you

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:38.739
when we do
your weight loss surgery.

1:14:38.741 --> 1:14:40.074
The other issue is that

1:14:40.076 --> 1:14:42.243
the infection in your leg
has come back

1:14:42.245 --> 1:14:44.312
because of poor hygiene.

1:14:44.314 --> 1:14:47.281
So we need to keep you here
to address that.

1:14:47.283 --> 1:14:49.183
But it shouldn't take too long.

1:14:49.185 --> 1:14:52.019
And keep up your good work.

1:14:52.021 --> 1:14:54.121
And since you lost
some weight...

1:14:54.123 --> 1:14:55.957
Mm-hmm?

1:14:55.959 --> 1:14:57.458
[Dr. Now] We're gonna go ahead
and put you

1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:59.160
in the schedule
for weight loss surgery.

1:14:59.162 --> 1:15:02.196
[both laughing joyfully]

1:15:02.198 --> 1:15:05.333
Told you, teamwork!
Come on, gimme teamwork.

1:15:05.335 --> 1:15:08.336
We been waiting to hear
them words, ain't we?

1:15:08.338 --> 1:15:10.071
Pretty good words
right there, ain't it?

1:15:10.873 --> 1:15:12.340
Pretty good words.

1:15:12.342 --> 1:15:14.342
- We got it, Momma!
- [Millie] We got it!

1:15:15.310 --> 1:15:16.878
That's what we sought.

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.779
- We got our surgery.
- We got it.

1:15:18.781 --> 1:15:20.915
And we're making our way there!

1:15:20.917 --> 1:15:23.251
- You in for the ride?
- [Millie] I'm ready.

1:15:23.253 --> 1:15:24.886
[Dr. Now] But here's
the situation.

1:15:24.888 --> 1:15:27.121
It's gonna take about a month
to make sure that

1:15:27.123 --> 1:15:29.023
there are no issues
with your infection,

1:15:29.025 --> 1:15:32.960
and to be safe before we move
ahead with the operation.

1:15:32.962 --> 1:15:35.263
So I'm gonna keep you here
until next month

1:15:35.265 --> 1:15:37.865
to do that,
and during that time,

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:40.101
I want you to work with
physical therapy

1:15:40.103 --> 1:15:41.335
to build up your stamina,

1:15:41.337 --> 1:15:43.471
get yourself ready for surgery.

1:15:43.473 --> 1:15:46.407
And you did very good
with anesthesia today,

1:15:46.409 --> 1:15:49.076
so you can do well
with that too.

1:15:49.078 --> 1:15:50.344
Okay?

1:15:50.346 --> 1:15:51.546
You hear what he said?

1:15:51.548 --> 1:15:52.780
Thank you, Dr. Now.

1:15:52.782 --> 1:15:54.215
Hey, you're welcome.

1:15:54.217 --> 1:15:55.850
You did the hard work, huh?

1:15:55.852 --> 1:15:57.251
I did.

1:15:57.253 --> 1:15:59.353
- I've worked my butt off.
- It has been a journey.

1:15:59.355 --> 1:16:00.821
[Dr. Now] I'm proud of you.

1:16:00.823 --> 1:16:04.225
So far, you have lost
161 pounds.

1:16:04.227 --> 1:16:06.027
One adult person she lost.

1:16:06.029 --> 1:16:07.028
Yes.

1:16:07.030 --> 1:16:10.097
She's done lost
as much as I weigh. [laughs]

1:16:11.133 --> 1:16:14.302
All right, keep the good work,
and we'll get you ready

1:16:14.304 --> 1:16:17.038
for weight loss surgery
soon, okay?

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:18.306
Thank you, Dr. Now.

1:16:18.308 --> 1:16:19.740
Thank you so much.

1:16:19.742 --> 1:16:20.808
You're welcome.

1:16:20.810 --> 1:16:22.777
You did the hard work,
you did the work.

1:16:22.779 --> 1:16:26.213
No, thank you, because now
my baby's gonna live.

1:16:26.215 --> 1:16:29.183
We're gonna get you down
to your ideal body weight

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:30.785
in 18 months, okay?

1:16:30.787 --> 1:16:32.653
- [Margaret] Thank you.
- [Dr. Now] You're welcome.

1:16:32.655 --> 1:16:35.022
All right, Margaret,
I'll see you later, okay?

1:16:35.024 --> 1:16:37.692
Okay. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:16:37.694 --> 1:16:40.061
You're welcome.
Well, take care.

1:16:41.063 --> 1:16:43.898
I'm proud of Margaret
and how hard she's worked.

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:47.234
<i>But I have a concern
that if we schedule her,</i>

1:16:47.236 --> 1:16:49.804
<i>she will go back home and relax,</i>

1:16:49.806 --> 1:16:51.372
and start to slip a little.

1:16:51.374 --> 1:16:55.109
<i>So keeping Margaret here
in a controlled environment</i>

1:16:55.111 --> 1:16:57.645
<i>will help make sure
that doesn't happen.</i>

1:16:57.647 --> 1:16:59.647
<i>We will help her to do that,</i>

1:16:59.649 --> 1:17:01.082
because she has shown me
she's ready,

1:17:01.084 --> 1:17:03.217
<i>and putting in the hard work.</i>

1:17:03.219 --> 1:17:06.988
<i>So aside from
any new issues that come up,</i>

1:17:06.990 --> 1:17:07.989
we will move ahead

1:17:07.991 --> 1:17:10.291
with her weight loss surgery
in one month.

1:17:29.945 --> 1:17:32.213
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:17:32.215 --> 1:17:33.414
I love you.

1:17:33.416 --> 1:17:34.882
You got this.

1:17:34.884 --> 1:17:36.317
<i>[Margaret] It's been
a hard, long month</i>

1:17:36.319 --> 1:17:37.918
<i>here in the hospital.</i>

1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:40.454
<i>But I feel really good
about all my progress.</i>

1:17:40.456 --> 1:17:42.690
<i>Especially because today I'm
getting my weight loss surgery.</i>

1:17:42.692 --> 1:17:44.291
[Millie] I'll be here
when you wake up.

1:17:44.293 --> 1:17:45.359
<i>[Margaret] It's a really
good feeling</i>

1:17:45.361 --> 1:17:47.028
<i>after everything
I've been through.</i>

1:17:47.030 --> 1:17:49.196
[Millie] Well, I have to come
back for her wheelchair anyway.

1:17:49.198 --> 1:17:52.166
<i>[Margaret] All my trials
and tribulations</i>

1:17:52.934 --> 1:17:54.602
<i>has led me up to this moment.</i>

1:17:55.570 --> 1:17:57.271
[nurse] This is where
we say goodbye.

1:17:58.073 --> 1:17:59.240
I love you.

1:17:59.242 --> 1:18:00.574
[nurse] And no more crying.

1:18:00.576 --> 1:18:02.943
- [Margaret sobs]
- Love you.

1:18:03.645 --> 1:18:06.313
It's okay, Margaret.
Promising you.

1:18:06.315 --> 1:18:08.282
This is the opportunity

1:18:08.284 --> 1:18:11.385
that we've been waiting for
forever, isn't it?

1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:13.688
Isn't it?

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:16.023
Let's make a deal.

1:18:17.059 --> 1:18:19.026
We run the good thing.

1:18:19.028 --> 1:18:21.595
It's gonna be okay, Margaret,
I promise you.

1:18:23.265 --> 1:18:24.331
It's gonna be okay.

1:18:25.267 --> 1:18:27.334
Quit crying.

1:18:27.336 --> 1:18:31.138
Come on, they've got to go.
Everyone's waiting on you.

1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:34.575
I love you. And I'll be here
when you wake up, I promise.

1:18:37.412 --> 1:18:39.847
<i>[Dr. Now] Today we are
attempting to perform</i>

1:18:39.849 --> 1:18:41.949
<i>a gastric sleeve on Margaret.</i>

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:55.196
<i>We have her weight down to 516,</i>

1:18:55.198 --> 1:18:58.899
<i>so we've gotten her to lose
another 51 pounds</i>

1:18:58.901 --> 1:19:01.669
<i>over the past month
on a controlled diet.</i>

1:19:01.671 --> 1:19:05.106
<i>And we've been able to get her
more active with PT.</i>

1:19:05.108 --> 1:19:09.310
<i>So I'm confident that she's
ready to take this step today</i>

1:19:09.312 --> 1:19:11.278
<i>and get her weight loss surgery.</i>

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:14.348
<i>What the surgery will do
for Margaret</i>

1:19:14.350 --> 1:19:18.219
<i>is that it will reduce
the stomach by 90%,</i>

1:19:18.221 --> 1:19:19.920
<i>leaving a small, narrow tube</i>

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:22.389
<i>that looks similar to a sleeve,</i>

1:19:22.391 --> 1:19:26.227
<i>so the patient's food intake
is physically limited</i>

1:19:26.229 --> 1:19:29.063
<i>and the patient is less hungry.</i>

1:19:29.065 --> 1:19:32.066
<i>So this operation
will give them an opportunity</i>

1:19:32.068 --> 1:19:34.268
<i>to lose even more weight.</i>

1:19:37.372 --> 1:19:41.342
<i>So this operation will not
only help curb her appetite,</i>

1:19:41.344 --> 1:19:43.878
<i>but it will limit
her ability to eat</i>

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:46.614
<i>so that she stays on track
with her weight loss...</i>

1:19:51.853 --> 1:19:53.587
MAN: Room lights off,
please, guys.

1:19:55.390 --> 1:19:57.291
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:59.860
<i>while we continue
to work with her</i>

1:19:59.862 --> 1:20:03.130
<i>on the emotional
and psychological issues</i>

1:20:03.132 --> 1:20:05.032
<i>behind her unhealthy eating.</i>

1:20:05.034 --> 1:20:08.769
<i>So this surgery will be a big
and important step for her</i>

1:20:08.771 --> 1:20:11.272
<i>in her journey to get healthy.</i>

1:20:21.116 --> 1:20:24.985
All right, we are almost done
removing her stomach.

1:20:32.894 --> 1:20:34.295
<i>[Millie] On our way here
this morning,</i>

1:20:34.297 --> 1:20:36.664
<i>I had to just keep
reassuring Margaret</i>

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:38.299
she was gonna make it
through this surgery,

1:20:38.301 --> 1:20:40.000
and I was gonna be fine.

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:42.136
<i>We've had a long time
getting here,</i>

1:20:42.138 --> 1:20:44.038
<i>we're just glad
we're finally here.</i>

1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:45.873
<i>She was nervous, she was upset.</i>

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.441
And of course
I couldn't let her know

1:20:47.443 --> 1:20:49.443
that I was just as nervous
and as upset,

1:20:49.445 --> 1:20:51.979
because, I mean,
she cried really bad

1:20:51.981 --> 1:20:54.281
<i>going into the OR, scared.</i>

1:20:54.283 --> 1:20:56.417
She's scared
she wouldn't wake up.

1:20:56.419 --> 1:20:58.085
But she was more scared for me.

1:20:58.087 --> 1:21:00.421
<i>Because Margaret's afraid</i>

1:21:00.423 --> 1:21:03.390
<i>that if something happened
to her, that I'd fall apart.</i>

1:21:03.959 --> 1:21:06.260
And I probably would.

1:21:06.262 --> 1:21:08.262
Mommas don't bury their babies.

1:21:12.701 --> 1:21:15.269
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:21:18.673 --> 1:21:21.075
[man] Keep pulling,
keep pulling, keep pulling.

1:21:24.312 --> 1:21:25.412
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:21:47.168 --> 1:21:49.336
<i>[Dr. Now] Margaret's surgery
went very well.</i>

1:21:49.338 --> 1:21:52.673
<i>We were able to do some
gastrectomy safely on her.</i>

1:21:52.675 --> 1:21:55.509
<i>We didn't have any issues
with anesthesia.</i>

1:21:55.511 --> 1:21:58.812
<i>There were no complications,
and surgery went very well.</i>

1:21:58.814 --> 1:22:00.114
<i>With this operation,</i>

1:22:00.116 --> 1:22:02.216
<i>Margaret should be able to lose</i>

1:22:02.218 --> 1:22:04.118
<i>30 to 40 pounds in one month,</i>

1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:07.087
<i>then after that, lose 20
to 30 pounds each month</i>

1:22:07.089 --> 1:22:09.290
<i>until she gets close
to her target weight.</i>

1:22:09.292 --> 1:22:11.926
<i>Margaret, after she recovers
from the surgery,</i>

1:22:11.928 --> 1:22:14.128
<i>she loses a little more weight,</i>

1:22:14.130 --> 1:22:17.164
<i>she's going to need to have
her gall stones addressed.</i>

1:22:17.166 --> 1:22:20.034
<i>So it's either that,
or she's going to need to have</i>

1:22:20.036 --> 1:22:21.835
<i>the gall bladder surgery.</i>

1:22:21.837 --> 1:22:23.771
<i>But right now, she's doing well</i>

1:22:23.773 --> 1:22:25.005
<i>and I'm proud of her.</i>

1:22:25.007 --> 1:22:27.474
<i>She has worked hard
to make progress,</i>

1:22:27.476 --> 1:22:30.911
<i>and to make the important
changes she needs.</i>

1:22:30.913 --> 1:22:32.279
<i>But we need to make sure</i>

1:22:32.281 --> 1:22:34.448
that Margaret is gonna be
able to cope

1:22:34.450 --> 1:22:36.150
with all the issues that she had

1:22:36.152 --> 1:22:38.118
<i>with the household dynamic</i>

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:41.221
<i>if she's going to be able
to do this for the long term.</i>

1:22:41.223 --> 1:22:44.024
<i>So it's going to be
very important</i>

1:22:44.026 --> 1:22:46.694
<i>that she keeps going
to psychotherapy to do it.</i>

1:22:46.696 --> 1:22:50.030
<i>If not, then it will only be
a matter of time</i>

1:22:50.032 --> 1:22:54.001
<i>before she starts to slip back
into her old habits</i>

1:22:54.003 --> 1:22:57.838
<i>to undo all her progress,
and gain all her weight back.</i>

1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:00.841
<i>But up to this point,
I am proud of Margaret</i>

1:23:00.843 --> 1:23:02.743
<i>for losing the weight she has,</i>

1:23:02.745 --> 1:23:06.013
<i>and for getting out of her bed
to become more mobile.</i>

1:23:06.015 --> 1:23:09.183
<i>That took a lot
of determination from her.</i>

1:23:09.185 --> 1:23:12.086
<i>And my hope is that
she keeps fighting hard</i>

1:23:12.088 --> 1:23:14.989
<i>to move forward towards
where she needs</i>

1:23:14.991 --> 1:23:16.790
<i>more and more each day.</i>

1:23:16.792 --> 1:23:20.094
<i>And if she does that,
then I'm confident that</i>

1:23:20.096 --> 1:23:22.997
<i>we'll be able to get her
to her target weight</i>

1:23:22.999 --> 1:23:24.365
<i>in the next 18 months,</i>

1:23:24.367 --> 1:23:25.899
<i>to give her the chance</i>

1:23:25.901 --> 1:23:28.369
<i>to start pursuing all the dreams</i>

1:23:28.371 --> 1:23:31.238
<i>she has never been able
to pursue and chase,</i>

1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:36.076
<i>and a chance to finally start
living the life she wants.</i>

1:23:51.459 --> 1:23:54.461
<i>[Margaret] It's been about
a month since my surgery,</i>

1:23:54.463 --> 1:23:56.063
<i>and I'm still recovering,</i>

1:23:56.065 --> 1:23:57.831
<i>though I'm feeling stronger</i>

1:23:57.833 --> 1:23:59.867
<i>and I'm starting to get better.</i>

1:23:59.869 --> 1:24:01.135
<i>And I'm feeling really good,</i>

1:24:01.137 --> 1:24:04.038
<i>because my food craving's
almost all the way gone.</i>

1:24:05.006 --> 1:24:06.273
<i>It's still hard for me
to believe</i>

1:24:06.275 --> 1:24:08.842
<i>that I made it as far as I did.</i>

1:24:08.844 --> 1:24:10.310
<i>And a year ago, I didn't know</i>

1:24:10.312 --> 1:24:11.912
<i>if my life
was worth fighting for.</i>

1:24:11.914 --> 1:24:15.115
<i>But now I'm here,
and I'm not only living,</i>

1:24:15.117 --> 1:24:16.650
<i>I'm making plans for the future.</i>

1:24:16.652 --> 1:24:18.552
One thing, Margaret.

1:24:18.554 --> 1:24:21.488
You can tell
you had the stomach done.

1:24:23.124 --> 1:24:24.191
[Margaret] Yeah.

1:24:24.193 --> 1:24:25.559
It's all yours now, you own it.

1:24:25.561 --> 1:24:28.395
Now you just gotta rock it.

1:24:28.397 --> 1:24:31.198
<i>[Margaret] Dr. Now says I need
to keep going to therapy,</i>

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:32.766
<i>and how that's really important</i>

1:24:32.768 --> 1:24:34.368
<i>if I wanna be a success story,</i>

1:24:34.370 --> 1:24:36.837
<i>so I had one other session
with Dr. Paradise,</i>

1:24:36.839 --> 1:24:39.239
<i>and it went a little better
than the first one.</i>

1:24:39.241 --> 1:24:42.109
<i>This time, he was real careful
to reassure me</i>

1:24:42.111 --> 1:24:43.977
<i>that he wasn't trying to take
my mom away from me,</i>

1:24:43.979 --> 1:24:46.180
<i>and I started to trust him
a little more.</i>

1:24:46.182 --> 1:24:49.049
<i>I honestly know that my momma
ain't gonna be here forever.</i>

1:24:49.051 --> 1:24:50.951
<i>Then one day, I'll be here
and she'll be gone,</i>

1:24:50.953 --> 1:24:52.786
<i>so I can live my own life.</i>

1:24:52.788 --> 1:24:55.089
<i>And it doesn't feel good
to say that.</i>

1:24:55.091 --> 1:24:59.159
<i>But Dr. Paradise says I need
to fake it till I make it.</i>

1:24:59.161 --> 1:25:00.627
<i>So here goes nothing.</i>

1:25:01.529 --> 1:25:03.330
<i>Hello, world, I'm Margaret.</i>

1:25:03.332 --> 1:25:05.265
<i>It took a lot.</i>

1:25:05.267 --> 1:25:06.967
<i>You wouldn't believe
the stuff that I've overcome</i>

1:25:06.969 --> 1:25:07.968
<i>to be here today.</i>

1:25:07.970 --> 1:25:09.803
<i>But now
I'm an independent woman.</i>

1:25:09.805 --> 1:25:11.972
<i>And Momma taught me
everything I need to know.</i>

1:25:11.974 --> 1:25:15.742
<i>So when she's up and gone,
and I'm here all by myself,</i>

1:25:15.744 --> 1:25:18.212
<i>I'm gonna do just fine
on my own.</i>

1:25:18.214 --> 1:25:19.646
<i>And that's gonna be
the best gift</i>

1:25:19.648 --> 1:25:20.914
<i>I could ever give her.</i>

1:25:20.916 --> 1:25:22.549
<i>To live my life for me.</i>

1:25:24.285 --> 1:25:26.253
<i>You know what, Momma?
I'm gonna thrive.</i>
