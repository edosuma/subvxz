WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:09.968
<i>Ever have that thing</i>
<i>where you think you know someone</i>

00:10.051 --> 00:12.762
<i>as well as you could</i>
<i>possibly know anyone, and then,</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:16.975
one day, it's just clear as day,
you were totally fucking wrong?

00:17.058 --> 00:18.143
<i>They won't stop.</i>

00:18.768 --> 00:20.103
They'll go after Andy.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.939
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.607
Why'd you change your mind?

00:24.691 --> 00:30.280
I guess if I can reach just one person
who might be thinking of hurting someone,

00:30.363 --> 00:32.907
<i>then a little good</i>
<i>will have come of all this.</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:35.577
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Jane.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.371
Do you know Paula Koontz?

00:38.455 --> 00:40.999
No, I've never heard of her.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.126
<i>Is Charlie who he says he is?</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:44.794
It's complicated, Andy.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.588
You know a lot of things
you never told me.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.757
<i>I'm calling about Laura and Andy.</i>

00:50.967 --> 00:52.761
I'd like to see Geraldine Ross.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.180
<i>I'm making a documentary</i>
<i>on sentencing reform,</i>

00:55.263 --> 00:57.098
<i>and I want to talk to Paula.</i>

01:01.269 --> 01:02.604
Sorry.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.900
Hey, Jane. You've been busy.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.307
<i>Professor Alex Maplecroft.</i>

02:22.100 --> 02:24.018
University of, uh, California, Berkeley.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.896
- My panel starts at 2:00.
- Identification, please.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.277
<i>Remember.</i>

02:32.861 --> 02:36.281
<i>You're a professor of economics</i>
<i>at a prestigious American university.</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:38.867
May I search your bag?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.076
Yes, of course.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.662
<i>You look the part,</i>
<i>so play the part.</i>

02:58.178 --> 03:00.805
Please remain inside the building.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.645
<i>Everyone will believe</i>
<i>you are who you say you are.</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:10.732
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:10.815 --> 03:13.943
<i>the next panel</i>
<i>will commence in 15 minutes.</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:15.862
<i>The dye pack is primed to go.</i>

03:16.779 --> 03:20.116
<i>I'll be in the audience,</i>
<i>ready to press the detonator.</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:55.401
<i>As the image of Martin Queller</i>
<i>covered in symbolic blood</i>

03:55.485 --> 03:58.238
<i>will be on the front page</i>
<i>of every paper around the world,</i>

04:01.199 --> 04:03.785
<i>everyone will know</i>
<i>what happened to your family.</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:11.292
<i>If there needs to be</i>
<i>a change of plan, I'll be there.</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:15.129
<i>Whatever it takes to bring him down.</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:19.509
Professor Maplecroft?

04:21.552 --> 04:24.514
I've been looking for you.
About time we met in person.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
- Mr. Queller.
- Actually, it's Dr. Queller.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.853
Johns Hopkins saw fit to give me
an honorary degree last year.

04:30.937 --> 04:31.896
Hmm, did they?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.566
I endowed a chair in psychiatric studies
in honor of my late wife.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.195
- I'm sorry. I didn't know, I--
- What you don't know could fill a book.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.448
In fact, it already has. Several.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.450
- Most of them about me.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.327
Our panel starts soon.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.872
Why don't we continue this discussion
there like civilized people?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.000
A plea for decorum from the woman

04:52.083 --> 04:54.585
who compares my corporation
to the Third Reich.

04:54.669 --> 04:59.382
Oslo is crawling with media.
Why don't we save the fireworks for them?

05:00.091 --> 05:03.136
That's what we're here for, isn't it?
To put on a good show.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.870
- Here to see Paula Kunde?
- Yes.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.176
Thank you.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.870
You're not Sheila.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.498
Sorry. It was the only way
I could see you on short notice.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.251
My name's Anne Jefferson, I'm a reporter.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.086
Are you here about my appeal?

07:02.171 --> 07:04.132
- Uh, no.
- Okay, get the fuck out.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.510
Uh, two minutes, and I'll get you whatever
you want from the commissary.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.555
I mean it, whatever you want.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.184
Nike, size eight.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.979
- Okay.
- Lotion.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.106
Rolos.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.275
And a carton of Camels.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.612
- Two minutes. Go.
- Yeah, uh…

07:31.409 --> 07:32.702
Do you know this woman?

07:36.831 --> 07:37.790
Daniela Cooper?

07:37.874 --> 07:41.627
She goes by Laura Oliver.
She's a speech therapist in Georgia.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.925
Are you sure?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.886
- I told you.
- She said your name.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.554
- Yeah, we're done here.
- Wait.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.347
You should leave.
I'm about to get very loud.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.724
Hold on. What about this one?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.564
- What's… What's this?
- Uh, nothing, it's…

08:03.232 --> 08:04.484
It's my mother.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.236
From a long time ago.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.534
She send you?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.620
To check up on me?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.540
She's scared that I'm gonna get out soon.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.000
Pay her a visit.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.839
You tell Jane… to go to hell.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.717
- Who's Jane?
- You fucking liar!

08:29.800 --> 08:32.178
- Tell Jane, I'm gonna fucking kill her.
- Stop!

08:32.261 --> 08:35.806
- Do you hear me? She's fucking dead!
- Settle down!

08:35.890 --> 08:37.642
- That rich Queller bitch!
- Let's go!

08:37.725 --> 08:41.687
She's fucking dead!
She's fucking dead!

09:19.225 --> 09:20.184
Morning.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.311
Get some sleep?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.569
You should come upstairs,
when you're ready.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.802
- 'Sup?
- Hey, man.

14:21.068 --> 14:24.113
Who the fuck are you,
and why are you following me?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.114
Put the gun down.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.202
Answer me.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.331
I will. As soon as you put the gun down.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.583
Where's your weapon?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.418
It's in my jacket.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.254
Take it.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.389
- I'm a cop.
- Bullshit.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.600
I'm around cops all day. You're not a cop.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.977
My badge is here in my pocket.
I can show you.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.646
Okay.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.325
My name's Michael Vargas.
I'm a US Marshal.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.745
Well, why would a US Marshal
be following me across four states?

15:16.790 --> 15:19.460
Because you and your mother
are in witness protection.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.386
In there.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.472
Come on.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.392
Come on.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.001
Here.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.137
Hands on the table.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.394
Afraid I might stab you with a chopstick?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.105
After you walked me
through a kitchen full of knives?

16:21.188 --> 16:23.774
You realize how easy
it would have been for me to grab one?

16:27.736 --> 16:29.738
- Get you something?
- In a minute.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.492
Sorry, did you want to order a beer?

16:33.575 --> 16:36.161
Apparently, the Marshals
let their agents drink on the job.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.830
I figured you were in for the night.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.873
Never did I think
you'd walk into that bar.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.210
Your tragic little story about not getting
to play soldier, what was that?

16:44.086 --> 16:45.921
I was being who you wanted me to be.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.094
I dumped that car,
and you still managed to follow me.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.394
It's my phone, isn't it?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.396
Jesus.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.483
Okay.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.279
How long?

17:11.947 --> 17:13.031
How long, what?

17:13.115 --> 17:16.160
Have I been… in protection?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.289
Your whole life.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.046
Hey.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.132
There are people out there
who could hurt you.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.134
Hurt your mom.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.844
Because she's a Queller?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.389
I don't know the details, all right?
I'm just here to assist.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.769
Okay. Then do something for me.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.400
Jasper Queller's holding
a private fundraiser in El Paso tomorrow.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.818
I need you to get me in.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.071
Why?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.822
Can you make it happen or not?

17:54.990 --> 17:57.785
You want me to get you a meeting
with Jeff Bezos while I'm at it?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.995
Well, I guess
I'll just barge in on my own.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.499
You can watch me get arrested, shot,
or whatever they do to people in Texas.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.587
I got a buddy
who works in private security.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.964
He may know someone on Queller's detail.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.051
That's it? A friend of a friend?

18:15.511 --> 18:16.678
Yeah, that's it.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.722
Okay.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.815
Andy paid me a visit
the other day.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.400
A bit of a surprise, to say the least.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.737
How was she?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.573
Her whole world's turned upside down.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.117
I think you know the feeling.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.996
Told me all about your storage unit.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.458
Suitcase full of money.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.337
Also said someone broke into the house.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.048
Hmm. It's nothing, just some… reporter.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.758
You're sure it wasn't Nick Harp?

18:58.762 --> 19:01.014
This is Felix, from D.C.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.560
We've completed
the threat assessment.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.521
- And?
- We're relocating you immediately.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.774
It's too big a risk
to keep you in Belle Isle.

19:10.858 --> 19:15.028
Start all over again?
No. I won't do it.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.448
- Given your exposure, we have no choice.
- You mean, I don't have a choice.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.825
We're trying to keep you alive.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.202
So I can be
your star witness at Nick's trial?

19:22.286 --> 19:25.164
Which is never gonna happen.
Because he's dead.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.542
- You don't know that.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.295
Nobody's seen him in years.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.217
Not since Clara was killed.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.848
You never saw these, did you?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.852
They found Nick's DNA at the scene.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.647
I'm just reminding you
what he is capable of.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.443
Believe me, I have thought about him
every day of my phony life.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.196
Life bought and paid for
by the federal government.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.239
- You owe us.
- Are you kidding?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.533
I gave up everything.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.203
Everything!

20:04.286 --> 20:09.124
And <i>you</i> let the most wanted fugitive
in the country slip through your fingers!

20:10.584 --> 20:13.170
Maybe that's why
you had that fucking heart attack!

20:21.970 --> 20:25.390
If Nick were around,
I would already be dead. He is long gone.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.351
And you know it.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.229
US Attorney's office disagrees.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.066
So you have new information. Hmm?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.401
I want to see it.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.404
You want my help or not?

20:42.532 --> 20:43.533
I'll think about it.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.887
She has friends,
she's smiling, she--

21:03.971 --> 21:04.846
Smiling.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.600
- I'd say we made it out alive.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.977
Yeah, she's okay.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.520
Yeah.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.815
- Shit. I forgot the candles.
- I'll go get the candles.

21:14.898 --> 21:15.816
- I got 'em.
- You sure?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.442
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.360
You want a beer?

21:18.944 --> 21:19.778
No.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.408
- Hey, Charlie.
- Afternoon.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.077
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I'm good.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.121
Hey.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.208
Aw. Thank you.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.461
Good timing.
We're about to light the candles.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.963
You want to stay a while?

21:40.465 --> 21:41.717
Can we talk?

21:53.228 --> 21:54.062
What is it?

21:56.815 --> 21:57.941
Clara was killed.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.861
Two days ago in Oakland.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.780
They found her in an alley. Shot twice.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.576
God. Oh, God.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.660
I'm sorry.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.456
- I know you were close.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.003
Still waiting on forensics,

22:18.086 --> 22:20.881
but a witness who picked out
an age-progression photo of Nick.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.926
Says she saw him near the scene.
Our guys are turning over every rock.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.805
He'll get away. He always does.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.100
And Clara's wallet was missing.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.312
So Nick could have her home address.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.733
There's only one way to make sure
this doesn't come back on you.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.193
We move you.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.411
Laura. He's still out there.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.457
What about Gordon?

22:56.083 --> 22:56.917
He just…

22:57.584 --> 22:59.211
He has to walk from his firm or?

23:00.212 --> 23:03.215
We'll find work for Gordon.
But he can't practice law.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.802
And Andy?
She goes to some strange school,

23:06.885 --> 23:08.720
tells a bunch of lies.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.808
Oh, God, no. I can't. It's just…

23:14.309 --> 23:15.977
I can't fuck with their lives.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.838
Your friend got us in.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.177
Why do you wanna talk to him?

23:50.470 --> 23:51.638
Jasper, I mean.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.355
I know this whole thing
must feel pretty strange.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.900
Why lie to me in that bar?
Why not just tell me you were a Marshal?

24:03.984 --> 24:07.279
- I wasn't supposed to make contact.
- What were you supposed to do?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.906
Just observe.

24:10.824 --> 24:11.908
But you didn't.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.827
Because you were about to get bombed

24:13.910 --> 24:16.121
and start talking about
all this to somebody else.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.914
That would have been a problem because?

24:18.707 --> 24:21.042
Your mother's
a valuable government witness.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.463
That's all I know.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.632
You know a lot more than that.
If you are who you say you are.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.220
I saw your truck parked on our street.
What were you doing there?

24:34.264 --> 24:36.266
Marshals pulled me in last minute.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.518
Charlie Bass couldn't
get there right away.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.228
Charlie?

24:40.937 --> 24:41.771
Yeah.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.234
He's the lead on your mom's case.
Which I should not be telling you.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.069
What does that mean? "Lead"?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.616
Charlie's taken care of your mom
ever since she entered the program.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.368
He set her up with a new identity.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.078
He got her a job.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.747
Made nice with her kid too.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.582
Advice on boys.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.043
A shoulder to cry on
when her parents split up.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.006
The goal is to create trust.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.801
Is that why
you're telling me about Charlie?

25:12.719 --> 25:13.887
So I'll trust you?

25:24.356 --> 25:28.610
NSA picked up chatter about a fugitive
crossing the Canadian border.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.154
These were taken along
the international boundary.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
Legal entry.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.662
Not so legal.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.665
Anybody look familiar?

26:18.994 --> 26:20.495
<i>If you ever leave me,</i>

26:21.288 --> 26:23.790
<i>I would scorch the earth to find you.</i>

26:32.882 --> 26:33.758
Sorry.

26:34.759 --> 26:37.178
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm. I'm sure.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.105
- I want to leave the program.
- No.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.400
- That is not happening.
- I'm done, Charlie.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.444
I'm within my rights
to sign out at any time.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.864
You want to walk out of here
and get <i>yourself</i> killed, that's up to you.

26:56.823 --> 27:00.243
You sign out now,
and you're putting Andy's life at risk.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.370
- And if Nick ever found her--
- He's dead.

27:03.663 --> 27:04.831
I told you, he's dead.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.709
I want the papers.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.545
Now.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.623
We're about five hours from El Paso.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.000
I figure we get a couple hours of sleep,

27:49.084 --> 27:51.920
hit the road in the morning,
be at that hotel before breakfast.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.173
I'll take the couch.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.801
You're not staying in here.
Get your own room.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.887
- That's not how this works.
- I'm not comfortable with that.

28:02.389 --> 28:05.225
And I'm not comfortable
with letting you out of my sight.

28:05.308 --> 28:08.103
So… tie me up
if it'll make you feel better.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.271
But neither of us are leaving this room.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.652
Gonna need my gun back.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.421
You hungry?

28:37.632 --> 28:38.466
No.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.009
Shower?

28:40.593 --> 28:42.137
Can you smell me from there?

28:48.643 --> 28:49.602
What are you doing?

28:51.354 --> 28:52.188
It's a habit.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.610
Look at you,
it's like you're not even a person.

28:57.694 --> 28:58.528
No?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.613
What am I, then?

29:00.697 --> 29:03.616
You're like a likeness of a person.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.618
Something I'd draw in my sketchbook.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.873
That's right. You're an artist.
How's that working out?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.416
Fuck you.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.459
Edgy.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.669
They didn't mention that.

29:16.671 --> 29:17.547
"They"?

29:17.630 --> 29:21.259
Yeah. Atlanta office gave me
some info on your recent activity.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.011
Hobbies. Work.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.430
Hooking up with your mom's nurse.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.682
What was his name again?

29:29.642 --> 29:30.685
Bobby, right?

29:37.358 --> 29:38.985
So what were you doing for her?

29:40.779 --> 29:41.613
Who?

29:41.696 --> 29:42.947
Your mother.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.742
Did she give you any instructions
when you left Belle Isle?

29:46.743 --> 29:47.577
Nope.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.664
How'd you know about the storage unit?

29:52.248 --> 29:53.750
She gave me the key, but…

29:56.252 --> 29:58.254
What would I be doing for her?

29:59.464 --> 30:00.715
Forget it.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.509
No, don't do that. You know something.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.595
No. Just… Try your mom again.
You two can talk it out.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.889
My mom? Who's that?

30:09.182 --> 30:11.059
The lady who gardens and bakes casseroles,

30:11.142 --> 30:14.479
or some daughter of a billionaire
who's been lying to me my whole life?

30:14.562 --> 30:18.149
She was in a cancer ward ready to go
to her grave without telling me the truth.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.318
So, no, I'm not gonna
talk it out with her.

30:21.945 --> 30:22.821
Have it your way.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.924
Can the likeness get a pillow?

31:51.075 --> 31:52.035
Yeah, I'm with her.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.872
Nah. She's asleep.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.668
What do you want me to do with her?

33:29.674 --> 33:30.758
- Hey!

33:30.842 --> 33:33.428
Hey, hey! Hey. It's me.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.181
It's me, all right? Come on.

33:40.643 --> 33:41.602
Come on, I got you.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.188
It's okay. Come on.

33:45.064 --> 33:45.940
Come on.

33:50.945 --> 33:53.489
Just breathe. Just breathe, all right?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.408
You got it.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.423
<i>I keep having this dream.</i>

34:13.426 --> 34:15.553
<i>I'm somewhere dark and cold.</i>

34:17.805 --> 34:18.723
<i>And it's snowing.</i>

34:22.894 --> 34:24.187
<i>And it smells like…</i>

34:26.230 --> 34:27.857
<i>It smells like earth, I guess.</i>

34:30.943 --> 34:33.321
<i>And I can see the snow through the slats.</i>

34:35.698 --> 34:36.824
It's all right.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.328
<i>I'm small… and alone.</i>

34:43.372 --> 34:45.083
<i>And there's someone coming for me.</i>

35:13.486 --> 35:14.403
Morning.

35:18.032 --> 35:18.991
Mind if I join you?

35:25.081 --> 35:25.915
Thanks.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.626
I thought you quit.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.420
I did.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.970
Right after that heart attack
I so richly deserved.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.520
Quite a place.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.773
Yeah, it's special.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.485
Who owned this house
before you boys took it?

35:54.569 --> 35:57.613
Some drug dealer?
Oh, I know. You can't tell me.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.826
I can tell you he's still alive.

36:03.911 --> 36:05.371
He stayed in the program.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.962
When did you stop trusting me?

36:13.838 --> 36:14.964
It's not about that.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.633
I thought we didn't bullshit each other.

36:18.384 --> 36:19.677
We don't.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.137
Then talk to me.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.975
You sent Andy away
because you were afraid of Nick.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.436
Now is when you need me.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.646
Now is when I help you.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.983
You're done with Laura Oliver?

36:34.066 --> 36:34.901
That's fine.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.112
You can be whoever you want.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.948
We'll move you wherever you want.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.450
To Paris.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.451
Vienna.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.330
Is that why you brought me here?

36:47.413 --> 36:49.123
So I'd want the good life again?

36:50.082 --> 36:52.293
I brought you here
because you're too fucking stubborn

36:52.376 --> 36:54.962
to keep yourself alive,
and I'm too old to bury you.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.718
I have spent more of my life with you

37:01.844 --> 37:03.763
than I have with my own family.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.515
Holding your hand.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.393
Keeping you safe.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.983
Didn't work. All this.

37:17.443 --> 37:22.365
It fucked up my marriage.
My daughter is a mess. And I am just…

37:24.951 --> 37:26.118
disappearing.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.710
You know, my mother
lived in a really beautiful place.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.423
And all she wanted… was out.

37:42.051 --> 37:42.885
Charlie.

37:49.892 --> 37:50.893
Just let me go.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.613
Paperwork won't be here for a while.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.283
If you need something, ask Felix.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.678
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

38:26.429 --> 38:27.972
<i>From my new roommate.</i>

38:30.808 --> 38:34.145
You should come live with us,
escape this mausoleum.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.023
Where would we put the piano?

38:37.106 --> 38:38.482
We'll tear out the kitchen.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.651
How will we eat?

38:40.735 --> 38:41.944
We'll live on music.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.534
This new roommate, what's his name?

38:50.911 --> 38:53.914
Nick. Nick Harp.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.000
Is Nick more than a roommate?

38:57.918 --> 38:58.753
No.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.380
Nothing like that.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.300
He's, uh…

39:05.801 --> 39:08.304
<i>He's just… different.</i>

39:09.013 --> 39:10.097
<i>Hmm.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:11.223
<i>Different how?</i>

39:11.766 --> 39:15.436
<i>Unlike the rest of Stanford,</i>
<i>he's not busy spending a trust fund,</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:19.732
<i>or joining the Young Republicans</i>
<i>or the Hitler Youth.</i>

39:20.524 --> 39:22.777
- <i>I want to meet him.</i>

39:23.361 --> 39:24.737
<i>Dad will hate him.</i>

39:28.240 --> 39:29.700
<i>Will I like him?</i>

39:30.284 --> 39:31.535
<i>Oh, no.</i>

39:31.619 --> 39:32.870
<i>No, definitely not.</i>

39:35.581 --> 39:36.665
<i>You'll love him.</i>

39:42.421 --> 39:44.048
<i>My father was…</i>

39:44.131 --> 39:45.466
<i>Uh…</i>

39:45.549 --> 39:47.009
<i>How should I put this?</i>

39:47.718 --> 39:48.552
Challenging.

39:49.220 --> 39:53.516
He did and said
a lot of things I disagree with.

39:53.599 --> 39:57.436
And, being a bit of a rebel,
I wasn't afraid to tell him so.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.605
You can imagine how well that went.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.733
The truth is…

40:05.152 --> 40:06.362
I miss my father.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.406
I'd do anything to bring him back.

40:11.575 --> 40:16.247
The corporate greed
he espoused is a different matter.

40:16.330 --> 40:20.543
I wish that had been
struck down in Oslo instead of him.

40:23.337 --> 40:26.507
I needed to change
what our family stood for.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.424
And I did.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.845
I created the Queller Foundation,

40:30.928 --> 40:34.557
to help those
who could not afford vital medications.

40:35.099 --> 40:40.354
And over the last three decades,
we've saved thousands of lives.

40:41.063 --> 40:43.816
When the Democrats win
the White House this fall,

40:43.899 --> 40:46.902
we'll take care of all Americans.

40:47.695 --> 40:51.282
Because it's the right thing to do.

40:55.035 --> 40:55.911
Thank you.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.917
I hope you all enjoy the book.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.468
A real pleasure to meet you, Alex.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.387
Thank you. And you too, Max. Thank you.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.682
Hey, thank you all, again. Thank you.

41:16.765 --> 41:17.850
Did we thank Hugo?

41:20.853 --> 41:21.687
Great job.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.149
Excuse me, Mr. Queller,
would you mind signing my book?

41:25.232 --> 41:26.066
Of course.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.280
And who should I make it out to?

41:31.989 --> 41:33.324
Jane Queller.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.457
Oh, my God.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.335
You, uh… You look like her.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.379
Uh, can we talk?

41:50.299 --> 41:51.467
Cynthia, uh…

41:51.550 --> 41:54.094
Could you escort this young woman to the…

42:06.357 --> 42:07.608
Right this way.

42:14.782 --> 42:15.741
Is there a problem?

42:15.824 --> 42:17.618
Mr. Queller requested to meet with her.

42:17.701 --> 42:18.661
That's not gonna work.

42:18.744 --> 42:19.954
Hey, it's fine.

42:20.037 --> 42:20.871
No, it's not.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.123
I'll only be a few minutes.

42:29.797 --> 42:30.631
All right.

42:32.049 --> 42:32.883
Thank you.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.718
Perfect. We'll talk soon.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.393
- Can I get you anything?
- Uh, I, I'm fine. Thanks.

43:27.563 --> 43:28.731
Would you like to sit?

43:29.315 --> 43:30.149
Uh…

43:30.774 --> 43:33.277
I don't, I don't think so, if that's okay?

43:37.072 --> 43:41.160
So, um… what did she name you?

43:41.827 --> 43:44.705
Uh, Andrea. Andy, for short.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.207
Of course. It's, uh…

43:48.709 --> 43:50.377
It's for our brother, Andrew.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.465
How is she? How is Jane?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.051
Uh, she's…

43:57.968 --> 44:00.012
She's, uh… She's okay.

44:00.095 --> 44:00.929
Yeah.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.850
Hey, look, I can't imagine
what you two have been through.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.061
Yeah.

44:08.103 --> 44:08.937
Mm.

44:15.569 --> 44:16.528
Do you mind?

44:20.074 --> 44:21.241
Andrea.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.371
Where have you been all these years?

45:21.593 --> 45:25.013
Hey! What the fuck, man?

46:14.813 --> 46:15.689
Shit.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.678
Turn to
your right, please.

47:11.620 --> 47:13.163
This is a mistake.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.361
So, Jane. I'm Charlie Bass.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.493
Let's talk this through one more time.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.372
You can't live anywhere
you've ever been before,

48:37.456 --> 48:40.000
can't so much as touch a piano.

48:44.504 --> 48:47.716
<i>You'll have to cut off everything</i>
<i>and everyone you've ever known.</i>

48:49.676 --> 48:50.552
<i>Friends.</i>

48:51.595 --> 48:52.429
<i>Colleagues.</i>

48:53.555 --> 48:55.474
I'm so glad you took me up on this.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.017
Or your family.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.360
<i>My family…</i>

49:09.738 --> 49:11.365
have never kept me safe.
