00:16.583 --> 00:20.759
It was clear .
Only one of us would survive .

00:21.750 --> 00:23.343
And at the end it was me .

00:24.333 --> 00:25.880
Not him .

02:04.500 --> 02:09.631
Pleasehelp me! I was kidnapped .
My name is Natascha Kampusch .
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,731
3096 Days

02:44.833 --> 02:46.752
This is my beautiful daughter.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.295
Here it is.
Very good around the world.

02:51.208 --> 02:54.062
We will not be that young forever!

02:54.667 --> 02:56.214
Health !

02:57.467 --> 02:58.214
I love you.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.925
Dad, we gotta go , you
Mommy promised me back at eight.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.177
We're in a minute , honey.

03:17.250 --> 03:21.335
And then the man said :
I ... and I have it !

03:25.833 --> 03:27.380
Natascha !

03:33.458 --> 03:36.507
Natascha ,you gotta get up !

03:37.583 --> 03:39.506
I'm not going to repeat again.

03:42.667 --> 03:46.251
I cast you out the dress.
Do I have to use ?

03:46.417 --> 03:48.636
Do you know how long you work on it ?

03:48.833 --> 03:52.963
Other kids would be happy that their
mothers made ??them such beautiful dresses.

03:53.125 --> 03:57.961
It's cute, but it makes me look fat .
Then do not eat so many cakes.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.794
Why are you taking so long?

04:13.708 --> 04:15.927
I have to go to work !

04:37.375 --> 04:39.798
Took you back into that bar?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.477
A girl has nothing
to do in a bar.
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,610
If you later brings back again
is the last time you 'll see.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.300
Enough! Give me a break , we were at the bar.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.715
Honey,I'm sorry !

05:02.958 --> 05:04.256
Do not get so ...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.547

09:28.583 --> 09:30.130
Hello?

09:30.708 --> 09:32.255
Hello !

09:32.917 --> 09:34.464
Is there anybody there?

10:44.625 --> 10:46.172
Arise !

10:50.083 --> 10:51.630
Get to the back.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.464
Take off your shoes .

11:30.333 --> 11:32.131
I want to go with my mom ...

11:58.458 --> 12:00.005
Help !

12:00.542 --> 12:02.089
Help !

12:02.750 --> 12:04.297
Help !

12:17.708 --> 12:19.255
Help !

13:03.167 --> 13:04.714
Mom ...

13:12.750 --> 13:14.297
Mom?
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,297
Day 3

13:54.000 --> 13:55.455
And Prince ...
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,755
the prince wanted to marry a princess.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.874
But it had to be a real princess .

14:03.583 --> 14:05.150
The prince wanted to marry a princess.
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,420
But it had to be a real princess .

14:12.417 --> 14:15.261
One night someone knocked on the door of the palace.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.630
Dale, take one.

14:33.083 --> 14:38.059
And the old Queen thought ,
will put that to the test ..

14:38.158 --> 14:41.633
and put a pea under the bed .

14:42.833 --> 14:45.962
And then laid twenty mattresses
Pea above

14:46.125 --> 14:48.844
and twenty quilts on them.

14:50.292 --> 14:54.468
The next morning she was asked
the princess how she had slept .

14:54.708 --> 14:56.836
And she said: It was horrible.

14:58.083 --> 15:03.510
I was lying on something hard ,
and I have black and blue all over.

15:05.167 --> 15:08.876
Then the prince took her for his wife ,

15:09.083 --> 15:11.802
because he knew he had found his princess .

15:14.875 --> 15:16.422
Then.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.797
Order .

15:34.875 --> 15:36.422
Thank you ...

15:42.208 --> 15:45.178
Already you go ?
Are you going to go far?

15:48.417 --> 15:49.964
Wait!

15:51.542 --> 15:53.761
Will you give me a kiss goodnight ?

15:57.333 --> 16:00.712
My mom always gives me
goodnight kiss ...

16:33.875 --> 16:39.382
Natascha 10 years has disappeared.
Hundreds of police are investigating ,

16:39.542 --> 16:44.048
since she disappeared the morning of March 2 .
Despite the relentless pursuit

16:44.208 --> 16:48.918
the team has not been able to find anything.
Natascha 's mother told reporters ,

16:49.083 --> 16:53.088
I lost all hope.
How could you say that?

16:53.292 --> 16:57.251
I did not, Mom.
The media report what they feel like .

16:57.667 --> 17:02.423
A dive team has been incorporated
looking at gaps in the area.

17:02.625 --> 17:06.209
Thank God Natascha was not involved there.

17:06.458 --> 17:10.884
Natascha remains without loss
trace. Now , in sports ...

17:13.041 --> 17:16.922
" Stop it, leave me alone ...
Help ! Help ! "

17:19.833 --> 17:21.756
"Honey , I'm sorry ..
Do not get so ... "

17:22.208 --> 17:23.755
Five, six .

17:33.517 --> 17:36.037
One, two , three ...

17:43.542 --> 17:48.844
One, two , three, four .

17:51.542 --> 17:53.636
One, two, three .

17:54.333 --> 17:57.963
" I have to count the days . "
Four , five, six .

17:58.817 --> 18:02.091
One, two , three ... what time is ..
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,291
This will serve for the next week.

18:11.792 --> 18:15.547
Beef and cabbage casserole purple.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.802
mashed peas and carrots.

18:20.042 --> 18:23.842
You can have one one day, another in another.
I give up until Wednesday.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.672
All right.

18:27.792 --> 18:29.385
And the potato salad .

18:30.208 --> 18:33.132
Without mayonnaise
so that you can heat .

18:33.375 --> 18:37.209
So I can me with purple cabbage .
As vegetarians.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.005
Vegetarians ? ?

18:43.375 --> 18:45.594
And then your favorite sausage salad .

18:45.750 --> 18:49.129
With cucumber and onions ,
as you like.

18:49.500 --> 18:53.926
You have to eat it soon.
Let's eat it now, Mother . Both.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.674
What have you done now?
Why do you say that?

19:09.792 --> 19:14.218
It is suspected that Natascha
has been kidnapped.

19:14.375 --> 19:19.181
Her captor had stalking while
going to school at this point on the map .

19:19.583 --> 19:22.102
Much of the information given by the police ..

19:22.149 --> 19:25.964
So that pervert should
be abusing that child

19:27.292 --> 19:30.022
Why kidnap another reason ?

19:31.625 --> 19:34.799
Who knows .
Maybe he's crazy mother.

19:42.167 --> 19:45.717
This is a letter to my parents ,
not to worry.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.919
Do you can send it ?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.547
Take off your shirt .

20:15.698 --> 20:16.194
Shampoo.
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,794
Not so much ! .
Any idea how much this costs ?

20:23.042 --> 20:26.046
Good for nothing.
Then let me go .

20:26.250 --> 20:28.578
Nobody wants you .
My parents love me .

20:28.688 --> 20:32.212
Really?
So why not pay the ransom?

20:33.667 --> 20:36.295
They do not care .
That's not true !

20:36.458 --> 20:39.462
Well , do not believe so .
But no one has paid anything for you.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.198
They have no money , why not
you sought a rich family ?
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,798
Why did your parents just have to go to the bank ?

20:44.958 --> 20:46.188
That's all you have to do!
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:49,088
All banks give money to abductions ! .

20:49.750 --> 20:52.834
You do not care !
Because you 're not worth anything to them !

20:53.042 --> 20:56.296
That's not true !
Yes ,it is! True!

20:57.250 --> 21:00.220
Come here !
Now I wash my hair.

21:00.775 --> 21:02.377
Stop mourn .

21:02.792 --> 21:07.047
I told you to stop mourn !
Could you stop?

21:07.250 --> 21:09.469
Look at me.
Stopmourn !

21:10.792 --> 21:12.339
Stopmourn !

21:16.375 --> 21:19.219

Shut up.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.502
Shut up ! Shut up !

21:22.250 --> 21:24.173
I can not stand the tears !

21:24.500 --> 21:26.047
Shut up ! Shut up !

21:27.292 --> 21:28.885
Shut up ! Be still ...

21:33.042 --> 21:35.044
Look at this mess.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.302
Look at me. Look at me !

21:41.000 --> 21:43.219
You're going to clean everything.
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,174
Grandmother ..
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:21,674
Want more coffee ?
Oh , no. I've had enough .

24:21.833 --> 24:23.631
What about you, mom?
Yes , please.

24:29.917 --> 24:30.551
Sorry.
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,951
I do not know because you can not get a job.

24:34.042 --> 24:37.376
What? - I said ,not yet
can get a job !

24:37.583 --> 24:38.530
Mom ...

24:50.458 --> 24:53.302
Sorry.
I was in the back garden .

24:54.417 --> 24:56.294
- Good day .
- Good morning .

24:56.583 --> 25:00.258
Are you the owner of this van ?
Yeah, what 's up?

25:00.417 --> 25:03.045
Can we see it ?
Yes ..

25:03.375 --> 25:06.925
What 's this all about ?
Could you open it , please?

25:07.042 --> 25:13.209
other. Are looking for a white van ? .
Is this about that girl .

25:13.333 --> 25:14.803
Natascha Kampusch ? , Was not that his name?
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,803
Do you know anything about that?

25:17.000 --> 25:21.176
I just saw on TV that looked for a
white van with tinted windows .

25:21.333 --> 25:25.793
I thought someone might approach .
Do not believe how many we have seen.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.209
I can imagine.
Why does all the blinds down ?

25:29.875 --> 25:33.459
Is customary .

25:33.625 --> 25:35.548
Of course. Excuse me ...

25:39.417 --> 25:43.172
I use it for construction .
- Well ...

25:45.625 --> 25:50.210
What type of work do you do ?
Telecommunications . I am a technician.

25:50.458 --> 25:53.302
And for whom do you work?
Pardon?

25:53.875 --> 25:55.548
Who do you work for?

25:57.333 --> 25:58.880

25:59.792 --> 26:03.346
Well , she did.
At the moment I am unemployed ...

26:05.017 --> 26:06.076
So live here then.

26:08.092 --> 26:09.751

26:30.167 --> 26:32.716
So you live alone then?
Yes.

26:33.833 --> 26:39.044
My mother and my grandmother just visit me .
They would like some coffee? Or a cake?

26:39.208 --> 26:41.961
Thanks , no. We have to go .
But ...

26:42.167 --> 26:44.295
- Goodbye .

00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,495
What do you think?
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,464
All is well
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:51,864
I love you ..
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:56,264
Good Night Natascha ..

28:09.417 --> 28:10.964
Good morning.

28:17.458 --> 28:19.005

28:24.583 --> 28:27.086
How long should I stay here?

I can have a watch ? Please?

28:36.750 --> 28:38.297
A watch?

28:42.333 --> 28:43.880
If you're good.

Yes.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.089
Stop looking .

29:26.083 --> 29:27.630
Why is that?

29:29.458 --> 29:33.042
So I can hear you from above.
And talk to you.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.381
Do you also 're alone up there?

30:17.258 --> 30:21.005

I wonder how my family is.

50:50.167 --> 50:55.924
Do you understand ? Because I 'm your family !

They're all dead .

51:06.125 --> 51:07.672
But I'm here .

51:09.375 --> 51:15.382
You're no longer Natascha .
We need a new name for you.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.128
Why did it have to be her ?

54:14.292 --> 54:15.965
Take off your shirt .

54:20.208 --> 54:22.836
There is no reason to use
inside the house .

54:30.583 --> 54:33.006
Why do you need all this space ?

54:39.958 --> 54:41.960
Does your girlfriend moving out here?

58:13.250 --> 58:17.255
So a propos ..
Did you hear what the skier ?

58:17.792 --> 58:21.968

Ski race ,

58:22.958 --> 58:27.338

58:27.958 --> 58:29.505
So ..

58:30.083 --> 58:31.630
Come on.

58:33.458 --> 58:36.091

You do not need one .

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:34.007
Why do you have to do everything twice ?

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:37.128

01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,128

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.922
No.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.254
I went to three stores to find it .

01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:00.544
Do not even think .

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.050
I have my gun and kill whoever .

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:09.089

01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:34.922
Take one.

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:40.132
That is enough even for your room.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.960
I'll show . Come .

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:03.755

" Obey me , obey me ."

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:18.297
Please an employee
in the electrical department .

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:27.510
This is something extravagant for bathing ,
however I like .

Vivi .

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:10.422

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:41.380
Yes , very well.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.959
And now the new bedroom.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.922
Surprise !

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:00.252

And here . All gold.

I know , I put myself tiles .

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.380
Here , look.

01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:27.877
The bedroom Aphrodite.
Or do you prefer the passion ?

01:17:28.917 --> 01:17:30.464
Well , pick one .

01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:36.964
- I want my long hair again.
- So come by Aphrodite .

01:17:38.042 --> 01:17:40.215
Yes.

01:17:41.917 --> 01:17:43.590
Oh , it's so pretty.

01:17:45.042 --> 01:17:47.465
And the carpet , very nice .

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.339
Color ...

01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:54.677
You have good taste .

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:59.004
Good .
Enough space for two ...

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.753
Come on, Mom .
I have a surprise.

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.755
- See?
-Now!

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:14.255
At some point we all need
someone is not it?

01:18:14.417 --> 01:18:15.964
Right.

01:18:16.333 --> 01:18:18.051
Now try it .

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:21.337
- That looks very strong .
- Oh , nonsense .

01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:32.172
It was delicious.

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.005
You are very funny.

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:47.465
The mysterious case of Austria
6 years have passed since the disappearance

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:52.043
Natascha Kampusch in their school ,
the case was never solved.

01:18:52.167 --> 01:18:53.760
I 'm here.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:58.213
There was no trail and to date
found no body.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:02.505
Many remember the photo of the girl
even after six years.

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:04.385
But I'm still alive ...

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:07.073
As heartbreaking theme of the book,
is creepy .
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,073
So many people disappear without a trace.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:40.043
Why are you lying in bed ?
It is noon.

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.880
Stand !

01:19:44.917 --> 01:19:46.464
Aphrodite is here.

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:50.344
- Who?
- Aphrodite.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:53.214
The new bedroom.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.255
Our wedding night.

01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:24.505
This is very beautiful.

01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:32.880
What?

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:36.011
- You do not?
- No. ..

01:20:37.417 --> 01:20:41.422
You belong to me , I can do
what you want.

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:49.052
Why did you choose me ?

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.502
I saw you smile ...

01:21:00.083 --> 01:21:01.960
I saw you smile.

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:09.297
- Hey, baby , how are you ?
- Natascha , no more cakes.

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:26.007
How long did it take all this?

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:30.670
From June to the following March .

01:21:33.042 --> 01:21:35.340
The pipes and cables.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:39.630
The plaster walls .

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:44.792
Always going to different
hardware to achieve things.

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.756
Getting rid of land in different places

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:52.594
Install the doors.

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:55.460
ventilation.

01:21:57.208 --> 01:21:58.755
All for you.

01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:31.676
Do not look at me that way.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.843
Do not give me that look !

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:47.297
What is that smell?

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:53.964
What did you do ?

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:56.130
Nothing .

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:00.796
You're not going to kill
Did you hear ? .

01:27:01.042 --> 01:27:04.842
Do not kill , you understand ?

01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:07.380
Look at me !

01:27:14.792 --> 01:27:16.339
Ah !
You ...

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:18.426
no ..

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.005
want ...

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:26.007
kill you!
Do you understand ?

01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:53.052
Why do you always have to ruin everything?

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.173
It could be so beautiful.

01:27:58.667 --> 01:28:00.590
But ruin everything .

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.047
Let me go ...

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.047
Never.

01:28:21.083 --> 01:28:23.302
Then one of us must die.

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:57.008
18 blows to the head .

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:09.462
6 strokes in the stomach

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:17.886
12 strokes in the ear.

01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:25.467
4 leg kicks .

01:30:31.792 --> 01:30:33.385
Come on . Come on!

01:30:42.833 --> 01:30:45.803
Arise .
Do not act like a fool.

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:48.802
I can not ...
Come on!

01:30:52.917 --> 01:30:54.464
Go !

01:30:54.958 --> 01:30:56.505
Go !

01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:00.880
Oh ,shit!

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.961
My knees tremble a lot.
You are about to ski!

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:10.004
- How much do you think this cost?
- 53 euros .

01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:12.210
- What?
-â¬ 53 !

01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:13.922

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.339
I need to go .

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.047
All right.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.298
Put on your sunglasses.

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.797

Nothing . Do not lie.

01:33:26.917 --> 01:33:28.464
Ah !

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.297
A 18 ..

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:09.385
You want me to court?

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:25.380
What , you're not hungry ? Hmm ?
Take the largest.

01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:29.255

01:36:33.583 --> 01:36:35.130
Yes?

01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:39.093
