<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:43.669
<i>we are blessed to have with us
a key man in the world today.</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:47.965
<i>One of the most beloved of the
Pentecostal movement in America.</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:51.051
<i>God has chosen him.</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:54.221
<i>There's a destiny
at work in him.</i>

00:55.097 --> 00:57.015
<i>He's prayed with presidents.</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:01.520
<i>Now, I know no one who ministers</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:04.666
so tirelessly to so many.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.128
<i>And he's been going
non-stop this tour,</i>

01:09.152 --> 01:11.047
<i>and I thank God for giving
him the strength...</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:12.632
<i>- Hallelujah!
- To be with us</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:14.842
<i>before he flies
back home to Tulsa.</i>

01:17.578 --> 01:18.930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:23.917
<i>put your hands together...</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.962
<i>for the one, the only...</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:30.567
<i>Bishop Carlton Pearson.</i>

01:59.244 --> 02:01.556
<i>We kindly ask you to
step out of the aisle</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:04.124
<i>to allow passengers
behind you to pass.</i>

02:04.583 --> 02:07.437
<i>Please place all carry-on
items in the overhead bins</i>

02:07.461 --> 02:10.213
<i>and any smaller items underneath
the seat in front of you.</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:17.679
No, listen to me. They're
not bluffing, okay?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.682
No, they're not.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.829
No, trust me. We're
at that point now.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.022
If we go back for more,
they're gonna walk.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.192
Could I get a red wine, please?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.071
Tulsa, for a deposition.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.032
All right, I'll
talk to you Monday.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.534
Okay, bye.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.555
- Here you are, miss.
- Oh, thanks.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.545
You a lawyer?

02:52.631 --> 02:53.631
Yeah.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.386
Must be a lot of work.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.646
You must love what you do.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.004
Even the preachers back then, a
lot of them were illiterate.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.924
Most of them were janitors.
The women were housekeepers.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.302
The way it was back then, you either
went to church or you went to jail.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.931
Every Sunday, the church folk would
haul in the drunks and the backsliders

03:24.955 --> 03:26.015
for altar calls.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.142
"Uncle so-and-so just got
out of San Quentin."

03:28.166 --> 03:30.561
- What are altar calls?
- Oh, you don't go to church?

03:30.585 --> 03:33.255
When I was young, but I
was raised Catholic.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.174
What happened? Why did you
stop going to church?

03:36.591 --> 03:37.591
I don't know.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.887
I think the part I liked the
most was being a family.

03:41.847 --> 03:42.847
You married?

03:44.599 --> 03:45.642
Technically.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.913
It's...

03:48.937 --> 03:49.872
Mmm...

03:49.896 --> 03:51.565
It's complicated.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.274
Oh.

03:53.692 --> 03:54.836
I mean... I should finish.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.862
You know, maybe it's
not just chance.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.865
You sitting there,
me sitting here.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.076
Like, fate?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.705
Or purpose.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.172
I can't have kids.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.678
My husband wanted to have
kids and I put it off.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.160
Do you have kids?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.310
Oh, yeah, I got 'em.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.290
Yeah, I got a boy and a girl.
They're a pain in the ass.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.236
I didn't wanna get married
and have kids, honestly.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.158
I was raised to believe that having a
family was a distraction from God.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.535
I struggled with it.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.079
I still do.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.124
Even though they're the most
precious thing to me now.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.666
I'm...

04:52.959 --> 04:55.104
- I'm so sorry. I'm...
- It's okay.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.881
- I'm such a mess.
- That's how everybody feels.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.927
Things are going okay, you skate by.
When they're not, the sky falls in.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.656
I want you to imagine
something, just for a second.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.599
And I want you to
really imagine this.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.727
There's a reason for things.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.271
And there's a simple choice.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.443
I could get you saved
right now if you wanted.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.656
- What does that mean, exactly?
- Pray with me.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.450
Relinquish your sins.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.888
Accept Jesus Christ
into your life.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.623
On a flight to Tulsa?

05:37.712 --> 05:38.964
Hold my hand.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.969
<i>And she's right there...</i>

05:44.803 --> 05:46.930
<i>and I'm right there with her.</i>

05:49.432 --> 05:53.395
And I know this woman is going to hell
if I don't do something about it.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.233
She's never been saved.
She's not born again.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.443
But I'm tired, Lord. I've...

06:00.861 --> 06:03.113
been to seven churches
in four days.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.491
Spent all night, the
night before, preaching.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.595
And I heard God say, "No,
don't let go, Bishop."

06:09.619 --> 06:10.619
Amen!

06:11.580 --> 06:12.622
"Hold on."

06:13.456 --> 06:17.687
I hear Him say, "She
needs your love."

06:19.671 --> 06:21.006
And it's a tough love.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.341
She don't want to hear it.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.821
It's like I love my kids. I don't
care how much that spoon hurts.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.658
Now all the white people
are looking at me like,

06:30.682 --> 06:32.243
"That's not how we
do discipline."

06:34.436 --> 06:37.623
All the white folk here, they like
the nice-talking for the discipline.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.190
"Now, don't do that, Tommy.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.652
Oh, please don't do that, Tommy.
Please."

06:43.236 --> 06:44.589
You know, I'm kidding,

06:44.613 --> 06:45.882
because these days,

06:45.906 --> 06:49.760
black people are starting to discipline
their kids just like white people do.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.929
The white folk are starting
to beat their kids

06:51.953 --> 06:53.723
like the black folk.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.976
Ain't that a blessing? I don't know.
Maybe it's a blessing, who knows?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.437
Okay, let's get
back into it, okay?

06:59.461 --> 07:01.856
Now, we love because Jesus
teaches us to love.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.773
Right.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.317
So, I can love my parents.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.944
I can... I can love my
children, I can love my wife.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.155
I love you, honey. I
can love all of you.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.533
I can love you, and you, and you.
I can love this beautiful choir.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.952
I can love this music.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.414
- I love you, Reggie, I do. I love you.
- Oh, I love you, too, Bishop.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.918
Jesus said, "I give you
the authority to love."

07:21.942 --> 07:24.653
You have been authorized.

07:25.028 --> 07:29.091
You have been anointed and
appointed to bring His love.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.201
- Yes!
- Yes!

07:33.536 --> 07:35.681
That's why we knock
on every door,

07:35.705 --> 07:39.352
turn over every stone,
bug people on planes,

07:39.376 --> 07:41.729
pass out tracts, rant and rave,

07:41.753 --> 07:43.648
shake 'em till we
save every soul!

07:43.672 --> 07:44.923
We may not like it.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.445
We may be tired or ticked
off, but this is what we do.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.530
Look at somebody and say,
"This is what we do."

07:51.554 --> 07:55.076
- This is what we do!
- Because the world needs to get saved!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.827
The world needs to get saved!

07:56.851 --> 07:58.996
Lift 'em up and
say, "Hallelujah!"

07:59.020 --> 08:00.539
Hallelujah!

08:00.563 --> 08:01.749
Say, "I'm a soldier."

08:01.773 --> 08:04.627
- I'm a soldier!
- Say, "I'm a soldier!"

08:04.651 --> 08:08.130
- I'm a soldier!

St. Stephens moved their
women's conference

09:15.722 --> 09:17.533
to Friday the 14th.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.784
I can get Julian from school,

09:18.808 --> 09:21.287
but I'm gonna have to move
your lunch with Lady Gail.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.312
Sister Gina?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.874
- You left it in the pulpit.
- Oh, thank you.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.168
I wanted to talk to you
about Friday's class?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.794
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.254
I think it's fine.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.131
Well, no, it's actually...
It's just...

09:32.155 --> 09:35.509
if you misquote scripture,
people question your teaching.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.244
I thought maybe we could run
through it together next week?

09:39.621 --> 09:41.891
- Claire, can you set a time for that?
- Yes.

09:41.915 --> 09:42.915
Okay?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.541
Thanks.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.233
You okay?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.676
Yeah, just go on up.
I'll be right there.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.219
Okay.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.166
We had a great turnout
this morning.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.441
- Full house.
- That's great.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.462
That was a beautiful
sermon today.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.486
Thank you.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.924
We ought to book you on
some transatlantic flights.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.258
You'd get the whole plane saved.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.327
Sounds like you had
a productive trip.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.250
Carlton?

10:27.252 --> 10:29.396
You ready? We're scheduled
back to back today.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.420
Let's do it.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.452
Da?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.912
Da?

10:44.936 --> 10:45.936
Da?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.319
Okay, Julian. More
greens on that plate.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.744
Maj is down.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.226
Do you want me to pack
your bag for tomorrow?

11:07.250 --> 11:08.751
No, I already packed, baby.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.393
Empty your pockets, sir.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.646
Step through.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.858
There you go.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.300
<i>Oh, man, it's good to see you.</i>

11:39.324 --> 11:42.219
<i>Tell me, Uncle Quincy. Tell me.
I want to know the whole story.</i>

11:42.243 --> 11:43.679
I've been praying a lot.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.246
Yeah, thinking.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.144
I... I guess y'all praying
for me actually worked.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.272
They got you a church down here?

11:53.296 --> 11:56.275
Yeah, they got that nice little church.
Yeah, about a mile from here.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.610
- Good Shepherd.
- Good Shepherd.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.802
Bus pick us up every Sunday.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.239
- Praise God.
- Yeah. Praise God.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.240
Six weeks.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.516
Six weeks, you're
out, Uncle Quincy.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.144
Yeah.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.273
There's something else.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.902
They found drugs in my room.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.155
It wasn't mine, but
that ain't the point.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.785
They're gonna revoke my parole.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.745
Six years.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.375
But my PO tells me you can help.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.920
I mean, if you write a
letter to the board...

12:34.545 --> 12:36.023
Who you are and all...

12:36.047 --> 12:38.841
the people you know,
maybe they let it slide.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.279
Is this why you asked me here?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.741
- No, it's not why. I told you...
- No, you told me you wanted to get saved.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.141
Yeah, I do.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.145
Hey, Carly? Hey, man.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.148
I had this vision.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.193
I mean, it's so clear
and beautiful.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.838
When did your PO tell
you about this letter?

12:59.862 --> 13:00.947
Oh, Carly.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.575
No, no. When did he tell
you about this letter?

13:08.746 --> 13:09.746
Two weeks.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.166
Before you called me?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.395
Six years, Carly.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.814
Doesn't matter if it's
six years or sixty.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.692
The way you live, you're going
to hell, and that's forever.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.110
Then get me saved.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.720
I can't save you to help
you with the parole board.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.224
- It's not the way it works.
- Can't do this kind of time anymore, man.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.562
- Hell, I'll be 76 when I get out of here.
- I'll come back.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.856
I'll help you through it.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.151
But you got to do the work.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.321
I want to help
you, Uncle Quincy.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.114
I do.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.785
This is the only way I know.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.217
Eh...

14:07.180 --> 14:08.973
- I still love you, boy.
- Yeah.

14:11.059 --> 14:15.313
I love you, Uncle Quincy.
I do. Always, always.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.318
Remember who you get
your charm from.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.137
Carlton? You okay?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.664
- Thanks for seeing me, Chief.
- God bless you, son.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.226
Richard.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.960
- Good to see you, Carlton.
- You too.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.256
Of course, he's your uncle
and you love him dearly.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.777
No, it's not just
Uncle Quincy, it's...

15:26.801 --> 15:29.137
half the people I grew
up with and their kids.

15:29.971 --> 15:34.308
They're all going in the wrong
direction, backsliding.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.727
What did I do about it?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.231
I feel like I...

15:42.483 --> 15:45.445
ran from home and spent my life
saving people I don't know.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.947
You did not run.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.534
You came here and got
into our university...

15:52.410 --> 15:54.620
and you dedicated
your life to God.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.747
But I understand how you feel,

15:57.540 --> 16:01.127
thinking of all those you
love but were unable to save.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.548
When Ronnie died, I felt
just the way you do now.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.675
Helpless and guilty.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.596
But what in heaven's
name was I gonna do?

16:12.346 --> 16:15.725
How could I ever
accept a gay son?

16:17.226 --> 16:21.081
And you know, when we got the news
that Ronnie had killed himself...

16:21.105 --> 16:24.042
more than the awful,
awful guilt I felt

16:24.066 --> 16:26.712
was the fact that I had
spent my whole life

16:26.736 --> 16:30.507
healing people and getting people saved
at the Crusades and on television

16:30.531 --> 16:34.076
and I could not bring my
own son to deliverance.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.371
I prayed and prayed for answers.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.708
It was the greatest
test of my faith, ever.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.378
And when I came to understand
that it was a test...

16:46.422 --> 16:48.382
then I was made
stronger than ever.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.011
Thank heaven, God gave me you.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.806
I've always thought of
you as a son, Carlton.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.910
That's what I tell folks.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.393
You're my black son.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.539
What year'd you
get here, in '70?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.732
- Seventy-one.
- Seventy-one.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.819
The Holy Spirit drew me to you the
moment I saw you. Praise God.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.781
And one day, maybe soon,

17:13.406 --> 17:15.117
the good Lord will call me home.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.413
But my comfort and
my joy is knowing...

17:20.373 --> 17:22.165
that you're here
to lead the way.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.791
Yes.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.982
I don't see how you expect us to pull
something like that together, Carlton.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.194
Look, just make a list of all the
cities I guest-preached at last year

17:32.218 --> 17:33.820
and we take the
pageant to every one.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.823
I'm sorry, the entire choir and band?
You know how much that would cost?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.451
Well, you know I can do arrangements
for a smaller choir, right?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.620
And we could just use
the local church band.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.830
Guys, I already have accounting
on my back about Azusa.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.583
- We're incredibly over budget, Carlton.
- I'm sorry, Henry,

17:46.607 --> 17:48.377
I can't care about that.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.295
- It's Ben.
- Tell him I'll call back.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.548
Do me a favor. Would
you rub his shoulders?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.365
Do something.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.177
We need to keep growing,
not rolling back.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.971
Nobody's saying we
need to roll back.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.056
We're shuffling sheep, but
it's all the same flock.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.249
If we're not reaching more
people, then I don't know.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.521
- You want some more maple syrup?
- Sorry, my car wouldn't start.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.838
Got here as soon as I could.

18:09.672 --> 18:13.485
All right, so this is the
one the ad people like.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.178
It's a mock-up, but
you get the idea.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.560
Looks good.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.646
No?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.401
The tears are a bit much.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.862
And your head, it's too
big for the wording.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.698
You should make the wording
bigger and move it over.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.326
Or you could make
your head smaller.

18:39.410 --> 18:43.080
Yeah, Ms. Pearson, I don't think we can
make his head any smaller. It's...

18:46.876 --> 18:49.187
I'm only saying what no one
else has the nerve to.

18:49.211 --> 18:53.090
- You're making everybody uncomfortable.
- You mean, I'm making you uncomfortable?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.218
You need to let go of Nicky.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.822
She's not organized, Carlton.
You said it yourself.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.282
She's late more
than half the time.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.492
I can't fire people 'cause
you don't like 'em.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.329
She's a single mom. She's late
because she's juggling a lot.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.539
And chasing me around
with my stupid hats?

19:07.563 --> 19:08.898
You left it on stage.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.085
You left another one in the parking lot.
Was that last week?

19:12.109 --> 19:14.737
- I hate those hats.
- Then don't wear them, Gina.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.698
What're we talking about?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.094
Hello?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.012
Ma?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.974
Yeah, Ma, slow down.
What happened?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.017
What?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.437
What happened?

19:50.731 --> 19:52.441
My Uncle Quincy hung himself.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.739
Yeah...

20:02.118 --> 20:03.118
Yeah, okay.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.211
<i>In some ways, Quincy raised us.</i>

20:14.630 --> 20:16.882
<i>Helped me raise money
to go to college.</i>

20:17.425 --> 20:18.759
<i>Some from this church.</i>

20:20.636 --> 20:24.157
<i>I sometimes wondered where the
rest of the money came from.</i>

20:25.725 --> 20:27.327
<i>We all know he had his schemes.</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:31.397
<i>But he was always
making people laugh.</i>

20:32.690 --> 20:36.318
<i>He'd always say, "Remember who
you get your charm from."</i>

20:39.405 --> 20:40.823
<i>He never found God.</i>

20:43.367 --> 20:44.577
<i>He never found God.</i>

20:45.578 --> 20:46.704
<i>But I pray for him.</i>

20:48.998 --> 20:50.207
<i>I pray for his soul.</i>

21:02.803 --> 21:06.932
It was good, what you said about Quincy.
He would have appreciated it.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.746
I didn't realize how
many stories I had.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.665
I almost told the one about the time
he took me and Elector to the track.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.417
At the man's memorial?

21:15.441 --> 21:17.210
It's one of my favorites, Ma.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.880
Ooh, I was so mad
at him for that.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.823
I never screamed so much in
my life, that horse came in.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.263
Then I had to come back and
tell you what I'd won.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.516
Elector knew how to keep a
secret better than you did.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.019
You were all, "God
sees everything."

21:34.043 --> 21:35.043
Mm-hmm.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.732
- You told me I wasn't going to heaven.
- You were gambling.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.859
I was six years old, Ma.

21:40.883 --> 21:43.969
- You scared me half to death.
- Well, it worked.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.146
- You know I went to visit him, right?
- Yeah.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.855
He told me.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.026
Said he was happy to see you.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.326
He wanted me to write him a letter.
He tell you?

22:05.574 --> 22:07.952
No, what letter?

22:08.494 --> 22:09.745
For the Prison Board.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.540
Vouching for him, I guess.

22:13.916 --> 22:17.062
He said he messed up and they
were gonna revoke his parole,

22:17.086 --> 22:19.922
but if I... if I wrote this
letter, they'd let him out.

22:21.966 --> 22:22.966
I said no.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.220
Why?

22:28.556 --> 22:30.182
Letter wasn't the point.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.395
He called me down there to get
him saved, but he wasn't ready.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.189
I told him I'd come
back and he...

22:39.108 --> 22:40.568
He just needed more time.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.027
More time?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.493
He was 70 years old.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.823
<i>They've survived the war</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:12.349
<i>and traveled hundreds
of miles to get here.</i>

23:26.614 --> 23:29.426
<i>It's a scene that typifies
the Western response</i>

23:29.450 --> 23:31.261
<i>to the Rwanda crises.</i>

23:31.285 --> 23:35.331
<i>Few people with few resources,</i>
o <i>verwhelmed by millions.</i>

23:35.873 --> 23:40.020
<i>The UN puts the death toll
of this genocide at 800,000,</i>

23:40.044 --> 23:41.897
<i>almost half of them children.</i>

23:41.921 --> 23:45.692
<i>And doctors fear that if the
situation doesn't quickly improve,</i>

23:45.716 --> 23:48.719
<i>many thousands more will die
here in the coming weeks.</i>

23:49.178 --> 23:50.971
<i>As one medic we spoke to said,</i>

23:51.889 --> 23:54.642
<i>"Either there's hope,
or there's nothing."</i>

23:55.392 --> 23:56.936
<i>We've asked the medics....</i>

24:13.494 --> 24:15.913
Oh, Lord. Help me.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.375
God... why?

24:25.339 --> 24:26.840
I don't understand.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.276
God...

24:28.300 --> 24:29.718
Oh, my...

24:33.764 --> 24:35.349
God, I don't know...

24:38.686 --> 24:41.355
But I still believe. I do.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.293
<i>I said, "God, I don't know</i>

24:45.317 --> 24:47.837
<i>how you can call yourself
a loving, sovereign God</i>

24:47.861 --> 24:49.780
<i>and let these people
suffer like this.</i>

24:50.239 --> 24:51.240
Oh, God.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.742
<i>None of them are saved.</i>

24:55.077 --> 24:56.412
<i>They don't know Christ.</i>

24:57.079 --> 24:58.330
<i>They're not born again.</i>

24:59.957 --> 25:03.895
<i>And when they die, you just
suck 'em down into hell.</i>

25:03.919 --> 25:05.004
Oh, God.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.631
Oh, my God...

25:16.390 --> 25:17.993
<i>And then I heard a voice,</i>

25:18.017 --> 25:19.852
as clear as my own, say...

25:20.936 --> 25:22.187
"Is that what you think?

25:23.147 --> 25:26.483
That we're sucking them all down into
hell when they die?" I said, "Yes."

25:27.776 --> 25:29.778
And He said, "What would
you do about that?"

25:30.988 --> 25:33.550
- I said, "Well, we got to get 'em saved."
- That's right.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.952
Got to speak the gospel to them.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.307
Then He said, "Well, if that's
what you think will get 'em saved,

25:41.331 --> 25:42.767
then put your baby down,

25:42.791 --> 25:44.668
turn off your big screen TV,

25:45.294 --> 25:48.023
and get on the first thing
smoking, and get 'em saved."

25:52.718 --> 25:55.012
I said, "God, don't
put that guilt on me.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.223
I've given you the best
40 years of my life.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.061
Besides, I can't save
the whole world."

26:03.353 --> 26:04.855
And He said, "Precisely.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.109
You can't save this world.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.654
That's what we did."

26:16.325 --> 26:19.244
Oh, stay with me. Stay with me.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.998
All my life, I've
been taught it.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.086
Everything I know points to
a choice, heaven or hell.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.338
Many people I loved...

26:30.756 --> 26:33.359
members of my own family went to
hell, and they're there for good.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.778
Now, I could never
reconcile that,

26:34.802 --> 26:36.804
but I do accept it, because
they had a choice.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.309
But when did these people in
Africa separate from God?

26:44.144 --> 26:45.604
When did they make a choice?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.650
And how do they get saved?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.114
And He said, "They don't
need to get saved.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.076
They're already saved.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.454
And I've taken them
into my presence.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.708
They will all be with me...

27:09.128 --> 27:10.146
in heaven."

27:16.218 --> 27:18.947
You get up there and
you tell 6,000 people,

27:18.971 --> 27:20.949
people who depend
on your council,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.910
that everything they believe, and
2,000 years of history, is wrong?

27:23.934 --> 27:25.703
That's not what I said.

27:25.727 --> 27:29.082
Okay, can you explain what you did say,
because I don't think I understand.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.150
I know it's confusing,
Henry, but...

27:31.733 --> 27:34.403
I felt God's love and
I heard His voice.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.675
Carlton, if those
people in Africa,

27:38.699 --> 27:41.052
Catholics, Muslims,
if they're all saved,

27:41.076 --> 27:42.995
does that mean that
everyone is saved?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.956
Everyone gets a pass,
however they live?

27:46.582 --> 27:49.168
- Homosexuals, murderers, rapists?
- I don't know.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.751
I don't know.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.923
But God isn't sending those
people in Africa to hell.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.319
A loving God lets people choose.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.739
That's scripture, right?
That's the good news.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.308
- If we "choose" to seek God.
- Those people, too?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.204
- I can't believe you and I are having...
- Oh, I'm asking.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.498
Yeah, yes. Those people, too.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.292
Dying of Cholera and famine,

28:12.316 --> 28:15.753
the mothers watching their kids die in
dirt fields in the middle of nowhere?

28:15.777 --> 28:17.755
Wherever they're at. Okay?

28:17.779 --> 28:19.966
Wherever they're at, in
whatever corner of the world,

28:19.990 --> 28:22.784
if they are truly seeking
God, they will find Him.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.014
Through a missionary, through
a dream, through a vision.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.624
One way or another, they
will be brought to Christ.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.834
And you're sure about that?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.104
It's the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

28:33.128 --> 28:37.007
It's the same gospel that you've
been preaching for 25 years.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.015
Why didn't you call me?

28:48.435 --> 28:51.855
Or call a meeting? Just take a
minute before you get up there?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.568
Just... come on, you
owe me that much.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.667
I don't know how long.
A few days, maybe.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.564
I'm only asking because I need to
figure out what to tell Julian.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.399
He's old enough to know
something's wrong.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.508
Tell him the truth.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.552
I need time to fast and pray.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.765
I'll be home soon.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.957
<i>Not even Bishop Pearson to
reinterpret God's word.</i>

29:33.981 --> 29:36.668
<i>Say what you want about what
he's preaching right now...</i>

29:36.692 --> 29:38.044
<i>you gotta give this man credit.</i>

29:38.068 --> 29:40.255
<i>He has done a lot for the
Pentecostal movement.</i>

29:40.279 --> 29:42.632
<i>Look, I don't want
anybody to go to hell,</i>

29:42.656 --> 29:45.009
<i>however, the Bible
declares, on Judgment Day,</i>

29:45.033 --> 29:48.221
<i>"He will judge the secrets
of all men's hearts."</i>

29:48.245 --> 29:51.140
<i>And all men are saved, whether
they believe it or not.</i>

29:51.164 --> 29:53.935
<i>That's just not... No. But
here's the basis of our unity.</i>

29:53.959 --> 29:58.147
<i>We all become sons and daughters of
God through the shed blood of Jesus.</i>

29:58.171 --> 30:00.233
<i>Which is what Bishop
Pearson is saying.</i>

30:00.257 --> 30:02.902
<i>He is saying the same
thing that you just said.</i>

30:02.926 --> 30:06.864
<i>I want everybody in heaven, because
that's what the love of God ought to be.</i>

30:06.888 --> 30:10.600
<i>I love him, but he
is absolutely wrong.</i>

30:11.435 --> 30:15.164
<i>Because if you are to refute the
Bible that you grew up on...</i>

30:15.188 --> 30:16.708
- You good?
- I'll call you.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.210
<i>If you are to say now that
the word has fallacy,</i>

30:19.234 --> 30:21.504
<i>then every person
who came to Azusa,</i>

30:21.528 --> 30:23.172
<i>you owe a refund.</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:25.550
<i>Every person who bought your CD,</i>

30:25.574 --> 30:29.512
<i>you ought to give them their money back,
because your name has become great...</i>

30:29.536 --> 30:31.204
Let them see...

30:32.247 --> 30:33.373
the purity...

30:37.502 --> 30:38.545
Oh, Lord.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.840
Oh, please, God.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.426
Oh, Lord.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.764
Oh, Lord, help me, please.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.768
If you had been there, then you
would understand the context.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.853
Don? Yes.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.105
Don? Hey, Don...

30:57.689 --> 30:59.042
Just listen to me
for one second.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.919
No, he did not stop believing
in hell overnight.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.424
Because they're trying
to draw in viewers.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.448
Henry!

31:07.866 --> 31:09.785
It's Ramsey, from the
<i>Christian Press.</i>

31:11.536 --> 31:14.831
Well, okay. How about this? I invite
you to come see for yourself.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.793
Okay, thank you.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.975
- Henry.
- Hey, Gina.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.703
Carlton's not home.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.582
I know. I was actually... I was hoping
that I might be able to talk to you.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.792
Can I come in?

31:40.816 --> 31:42.401
Yeah. Please.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.658
I honestly don't know where
he's going with this.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.454
I also don't know where
he's coming from.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.916
Did something happen
between the two of you?

31:59.418 --> 32:02.563
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.965
No. No, nothing happened.

32:06.133 --> 32:09.070
Nothing new, anyway. He doesn't
really talk to me, Henry.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.762
I think you know how things are.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.472
I do.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.938
Carlton was married to the church
long before I ever came along.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.151
You know what Oral said
to me when we first met?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.212
He said...

32:26.236 --> 32:29.406
He said, "Get married and
the love will come."

32:30.574 --> 32:31.968
Carlton loves you.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.411
Oh, I know. And I love him.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.497
But this was practically
an arranged marriage.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.561
Single, 40-year-old man,
leading a family church

32:41.585 --> 32:43.896
and all the women throwing
themselves at him.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.048
It's no wonder he chose me.
I'm an outsider.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.280
The balcony practically cleared
out after he got married.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.574
We used to joke that you'd
be the ruin of the church.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.141
I heard those jokes.

32:59.269 --> 33:02.022
I know I'm not the first
lady ya'll were expecting.

33:11.781 --> 33:12.781
Speak to him?

33:14.034 --> 33:15.285
See if you get anywhere.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.161
Please.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.962
- Everybody's nervous.
- You speak to Henry?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.566
Yeah, this morning. Um...

33:28.590 --> 33:32.093
He just wanted to know if we talked
and if anything had changed.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.072
He put out a notice telling
everybody just to, you know,

33:35.096 --> 33:37.474
be patient and everything
will get cleared up.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.809
What about you?

33:41.061 --> 33:43.331
Well, Bishop, I'll stand
with you through whatever.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.815
No, I mean what did you
think about what I said?

33:46.691 --> 33:49.402
Well, I mean, I liked it
when you were saying it.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.529
I mean...

33:52.280 --> 33:54.157
I've always been
terrified of hell.

33:54.991 --> 33:59.013
You know, but Henry's saying we could
really lose people if you keep going on...

33:59.037 --> 34:00.664
Henry worries too much.

34:02.207 --> 34:06.562
Bishop, I don't know what I would
do without this church, okay?

34:06.586 --> 34:09.422
- What're you talking about?
- This is all I got.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.677
You're stronger now.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.824
You got your demons, same
as me, same as anybody.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.036
Yeah, but we know that it
ain't really all the same.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.853
You fight it the same way.

34:26.940 --> 34:27.833
You know...

34:27.857 --> 34:31.360
You know how many times my mama tried
to get me delivered back home?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.447
You may never be
fully delivered.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.578
But being gay and doing
gay ain't the same thing.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.456
It's how you live that matters.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.003
You stay with God,
He'll stay with you.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.797
He'll keep you
strong and healthy.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.788
- Hello.
- Two?

35:05.812 --> 35:07.123
- No, we're meeting friends.
- Oh.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.773
- There... there they are.
- Go ahead.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.692
<i>I cut my trip short.</i>

35:12.068 --> 35:13.796
- You didn't have to.
- Yes, I did.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.155
I did have to.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.283
And I'm hoping that you've
come to your senses.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.370
Nothing's changed, Chief.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.125
- If anything, it's clearer to me now.
- Clearer to you?

35:28.335 --> 35:32.189
Would you excuse us, Richard?
Just give us a moment, please?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.733
- You too, son. You mind?
- No.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.693
Thanks so much, I appreciate it.

35:35.717 --> 35:36.717
We won't be long.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.491
Carlton, what is going on?

35:44.309 --> 35:48.355
You know, I wake up every morning and
I expect to feel like my old self.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.792
To feel the need to go out there
and save people, but I...

35:51.816 --> 35:53.193
I don't.

35:54.361 --> 35:57.405
I-I don't. I feel...
I feel free of that.

35:57.822 --> 36:01.534
First, I thought it was just those people
in Africa, but it's not. It's everybody.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.306
Everybody. His blood
covered everybody.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.165
No, that's heresy, son.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.879
- Chief...
- It is heresy, believe me.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.131
Now, listen to me, please.

36:15.465 --> 36:18.277
I watched you build your
church and your ministry,

36:18.301 --> 36:20.237
and nothing filled
me with more pride

36:20.261 --> 36:22.657
than to see how quickly
they came to see you.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.242
Blacks and whites together,
that's a very rare thing.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.953
And now, you've got the
television broadcast

36:27.977 --> 36:30.831
with a whole lot more
people listening to you.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.958
So, I need to ask you
one question, son.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.359
And think about this.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.612
Are you certain it was
God's voice you heard?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.991
You know how the devil works.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.096
You saw your uncle die, unsaved.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.873
He saw you weak and vulnerable, and
told you what you wanted to hear.

36:49.916 --> 36:53.979
If everyone you love cannot enter the
kingdom through the narrow gate,

36:54.003 --> 36:56.524
he will widen that gate
to accommodate them.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.259
It makes sense because
he makes it make sense.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.863
Satan's a snake. He's
a ventriloquist.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.889
And he chose to
speak through you.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.868
But if you continue to lead
people down this path,

37:07.892 --> 37:11.813
it's not only your eternal salvation
you're putting at risk, it's theirs, too.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.983
And that's Satan's victory,
so I ask you again, son,

37:15.734 --> 37:19.362
are you certain it was God's voice
you heard and not the devil?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.803
You need to consider everything
you're putting at risk,

37:25.827 --> 37:27.328
and not just for yourself.

37:29.038 --> 37:33.626
We can go and reason things out later,
but first, we need to fix this.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.106
We'll write something together
right here, right now.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.382
And come Sunday, you'll
make all this right.

37:41.718 --> 37:42.718
All right.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.804
Now, lookie here.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.558
I was taking some notes and I'm
going to suggest that you...

37:49.142 --> 37:51.728
consider Romans 10:9.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.190
I know you're familiar with it.
I've heard you preach on it.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.648
All right.

37:57.525 --> 38:02.071
I want you to consider that,
and also consider preparing...

38:23.051 --> 38:24.177
Henry came by.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.515
Why? He knew where I was.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.976
He came to talk to me.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.565
He thinks you're having
a nervous breakdown.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.908
What did Oral say?

38:50.870 --> 38:52.413
He wants me to recant.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.083
Is that what you're gonna do?

38:58.962 --> 39:00.547
Do you believe God spoke to me?

39:04.342 --> 39:07.488
Well, what does it matter what
I think or what anyone thinks?

39:07.512 --> 39:08.596
Matters to me.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.305
Oh?

39:12.267 --> 39:13.268
Since when?

39:17.063 --> 39:19.416
Henry wants to
know about our home,

39:19.440 --> 39:22.127
and if I'll talk some sense into
you, and you're looking at me for,

39:22.151 --> 39:24.338
- I don't know what.
- Why are you angry?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.364
Because you believed it.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.074
You were sure.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.702
It's not that simple.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.372
God spoke to you or he didn't.

39:34.664 --> 39:37.977
And everyone else, Oral
and Henry and the church,

39:38.001 --> 39:40.437
they have nothing to do with
whether it's true or not.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.982
- It's easy for you, Gina.
- How is it easy for me?

39:43.006 --> 39:45.568
Because I'm responsible for a lot
of things and a lot of people,

39:45.592 --> 39:48.487
including you and
Julian and Majesty...

39:48.511 --> 39:50.573
You'd just as soon see the
church go up in smoke.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.056
You said it yourself.

39:52.974 --> 39:53.974
Wow.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.870
The lawyer? You wanna go there?

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313
You're really gonna bring
that up right now, Carlton?

40:00.899 --> 40:04.611
The only reason I spoke to him was
so that maybe you would listen.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.406
Maybe you would notice
I was in the room.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.512
I had children for you
and for this church.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.955
Carlton, why would I want
to see it go up in smoke?

40:17.206 --> 40:20.043
I thought being with you
meant standing with God.

40:21.711 --> 40:24.547
I thought it meant being a
part of something meaningful.

- Keep on keeping on.
- Keep on keeping on.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.997
Turn to somebody and
say, "We're still here."

42:45.021 --> 42:46.373
We're still here.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.667
I said look at somebody and
say, "We're still here."

42:48.691 --> 42:50.318
We're still here.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.696
I'm gonna get straight
into it, okay?

42:56.741 --> 42:58.367
Now, last Sunday, I...

43:00.078 --> 43:03.289
I told you that God
spoke to me and...

43:04.999 --> 43:06.751
he told me that all
those people...

43:07.710 --> 43:11.881
out there starving and dying in
Africa, without being saved...

43:13.883 --> 43:15.301
they're all going to heaven.

43:17.053 --> 43:18.053
Now...

43:18.429 --> 43:19.847
that's quite a statement.

43:20.223 --> 43:23.142
And to come up here and just
blurt it out the way I did...

43:26.020 --> 43:27.063
I regret it.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.568
All week, people have been...

43:34.612 --> 43:35.738
talking to me...

43:37.365 --> 43:40.576
and trying to help me understand
what I heard and why.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.289
I'm sure many of you've been
having those same conversations.

43:46.165 --> 43:49.293
You say, "If they're saved, does
that mean everybody's saved?"

43:51.379 --> 43:54.841
And if that's true, if you don't
need to accept Jesus, then...

43:55.466 --> 43:56.968
why come to church at all?

43:58.636 --> 44:03.742
And if the Bible says that only those
that accept Christ can be saved,

44:03.766 --> 44:06.269
then it all points to one thing.

44:10.481 --> 44:14.068
That it wasn't God's
voice I heard.

44:16.904 --> 44:17.947
Something else.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.334
Now Romans...

44:31.627 --> 44:33.647
Romans 10:9 says...

44:37.592 --> 44:39.343
I've been...

44:40.136 --> 44:43.347
I've been reading and praying all
week, trying to understand it.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.435
Romans 10:9 says, um...

44:58.738 --> 44:59.738
Henry?

45:03.326 --> 45:05.703
Henry, could you come up here
and read something for me?

45:06.204 --> 45:07.205
If you don't mind.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.080
Of course.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.546
It's, um... It's from
First John, Chapter Two.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.927
It's there. "My dear children."

45:25.348 --> 45:28.535
"My dear children, I write this
so that you will not sin."

45:28.559 --> 45:31.538
"My dear children, I write this
so that you will not sin."

45:31.562 --> 45:33.290
"But if anyone does sin,

45:33.314 --> 45:35.959
we have one who speaks to
the Father in our defense."

45:35.983 --> 45:37.360
"But if anybody does sin,

45:37.902 --> 45:41.548
then we have one who speaks to
the Father in our defense."

45:41.572 --> 45:44.450
"His name is Jesus Christ,
the righteous one."

45:45.368 --> 45:48.704
"His name is Jesus Christ,
the righteous one," go on.

45:53.793 --> 45:56.545
"And He is the atoning
sacrifice for our sins.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.049
But not only for ours..."

46:01.968 --> 46:03.552
"Not only for ours...

46:05.805 --> 46:07.848
but for the sins of
the whole world."

46:11.018 --> 46:13.271
It means Jesus died
for everybody.

46:14.522 --> 46:16.166
That's the literal meaning.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.984
Everyone's included
in the redemption.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.754
Even people that never
accepted Christ,

46:20.778 --> 46:23.382
never heard the word of God,
never set foot in a church.

46:23.406 --> 46:25.384
All those people in Africa
and everybody else.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.410
Everyone's already saved.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.036
And that...

46:30.705 --> 46:32.790
is the finished
work of the cross.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.728
- That is not right.
- John.

46:36.752 --> 46:38.730
I'm gonna answer your questions.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.899
No. No, no, you can't
just rewrite the Bible.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.443
I'm not rewriting anything,
I'm just rereading it, John.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.696
No, you speak the word
of God in this church!

46:45.720 --> 46:47.698
Sit down! Let him finish.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.033
No. You are a messenger, Bishop.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.202
<i>- </i> Sit down.
- Okay, settle down.

46:52.226 --> 46:55.080
- John, Ben, sit down, please.
- No, I've had enough of this.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.231
Come on, let's go. You know...

46:58.190 --> 47:00.919
- we built this church.
- Okay.

47:00.943 --> 47:01.943
We did!

47:02.987 --> 47:04.113
You remember that.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.843
No, it's okay. Just
let 'em leave.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.035
Let 'em leave.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.479
Look, Jesus said study the
scriptures diligently

47:19.503 --> 47:21.922
- because they "testify about me."
- Amen.

47:22.506 --> 47:24.609
Now, if we do... If we do
study them diligently,

47:24.633 --> 47:27.112
then we have to understand
there are contradictions.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.990
For all the Bible says, that the only
way to heaven is to accept Christ,

47:30.014 --> 47:32.308
there's just as much that
says we don't need to.

47:32.683 --> 47:36.145
Now, I just read First
John, but it's... it's...

47:36.771 --> 47:39.815
it's in Corinthians. It's in...
it's in Timothy.

47:40.149 --> 47:42.526
Peter. Here's Timothy 4:9.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.820
Timothy 4:9.

47:46.280 --> 47:51.053
"God is the savior of all mankind,
especially those who believe."

47:51.077 --> 47:52.244
And he goes on.

47:52.661 --> 47:53.746
And, uh...

47:54.330 --> 47:56.207
And there's Paul in Corinthians.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.186
- Thank you.
- I just reread this last night.

47:59.210 --> 48:03.732
"As in Adam all men die, so in
Christ all men shall be made alive."

48:03.756 --> 48:04.799
"All men"!

48:05.257 --> 48:06.342
I can't stay here.

48:12.890 --> 48:16.227
This is the same Bible we've been...
we've been reading all our lives.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.291
So, he's saying... I
don't understand.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.400
Minnie, I...

48:23.275 --> 48:24.777
Minnie, I know it's hard.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.821
I know it's hard, but...

48:27.822 --> 48:30.801
but you know me well enough to know I'd
listen to you or anybody else here.

48:30.825 --> 48:33.744
I'm just asking you to do the
same for me now, please.

48:35.329 --> 48:38.707
People have been saying that I...
I stopped believing in hell.

48:39.917 --> 48:43.671
And I've been thinking about that and
I've been... I've been praying on it.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.965
The God that we worship...

48:47.716 --> 48:50.761
from the parts of this
Bible that we focus on...

48:53.013 --> 48:54.473
that God is a monster.

48:56.851 --> 49:00.497
If we're really saying that God sends
billions of people to burn in hell

49:00.521 --> 49:03.291
for eternity for missing the
mark or missing the point,

49:03.315 --> 49:06.211
or being born someplace else,
well, that God is a monster.

49:06.235 --> 49:09.631
That God is worse than Hitler. That
God is worse than Saddam Hussein.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.866
But that's...
that's not our God.

49:12.366 --> 49:14.994
That's not the God
that we worship.

49:15.578 --> 49:18.247
No, that God loves us all!

Quite a show.

50:11.592 --> 50:12.592
I'm sorry.

50:14.637 --> 50:16.448
I'm out there vouching for you.

50:16.472 --> 50:17.824
I'm making promises all week,

50:17.848 --> 50:20.076
and you march me out there
like I'm some kind of puppet.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.268
I can't just ignore it.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.206
You want proof it wasn't
God's voice you heard?

50:24.230 --> 50:27.024
Half our congregation
walking out, that was it.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.402
What more proof do you need?

50:40.454 --> 50:44.833
<i>Exactly what is your relationship
now with Carlton Pearson?</i>

50:46.544 --> 50:47.795
<i>I'm sorry, um.</i>..

50:48.796 --> 50:51.090
<i>When you've known someone
as long as I've known...</i>

50:51.215 --> 50:53.276
<i>Bishop Pearson, it can
be very difficult</i>.

50:53.300 --> 50:58.281
<i>Oh, well, Richard, I mean, you two
grew up together, in essence.</i>

50:58.305 --> 51:01.326
<i>And your dad took him in
and raised him at ORU.</i>

51:01.350 --> 51:02.536
<i>That's right.</i>

51:02.560 --> 51:05.997
<i>I always thought of him as a younger
sibling I had to look out for.</i>

51:06.021 --> 51:09.793
<i>And now you think this is
the work of dark forces.</i>

51:09.817 --> 51:11.127
<i>Dark angels.</i>

51:11.151 --> 51:13.421
<i>Oh, I believe the devil
has gotten to him, yes.</i>

51:13.445 --> 51:15.590
<i>- And he's being controlled.
- To lead others astray?</i>

51:15.614 --> 51:16.782
<i>That's right.</i>

51:17.283 --> 51:21.096
<i>He's a powerful and trusted voice.
This is a dangerous situation.</i>

51:21.120 --> 51:22.847
<i>And what does Dad say?</i>

51:22.871 --> 51:25.457
<i>- I imagine you talk about it.
- Of course.</i>

51:26.625 --> 51:27.793
<i>He's heartbroken.</i>

51:29.837 --> 51:30.963
<i>He's lost a son.</i>

51:32.881 --> 51:35.318
Can't believe he would
go after you like that.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.802
<i>Not with God's help.</i>

51:37.094 --> 51:38.530
<i>We can all be healed...</i>

51:38.554 --> 51:42.117
- He's waited 25 years for the chance.
<i>- You never lose anyone completely,</i>

51:42.141 --> 51:43.141
<i>you know that.</i>

51:43.976 --> 51:45.811
<i>Just like he's got you, Richard.</i>

52:29.980 --> 52:31.958
- Hey.
- How you doing?

52:31.982 --> 52:34.318
Nice to see you. Hey, Henry.

52:34.735 --> 52:35.778
Hi, how are you?

52:36.236 --> 52:37.321
Please, come in.

52:38.572 --> 52:39.716
- Hello, Gina.
- Henry.

52:39.740 --> 52:43.219
We got some... we got some coffee
on, if anybody wants some, and...

52:43.243 --> 52:44.286
want anything to eat?

52:44.912 --> 52:46.121
I think everyone's okay.

52:46.997 --> 52:47.932
Okay.

52:47.956 --> 52:51.519
Look, before you say anything, I want you
to know I should have done things...

52:51.543 --> 52:53.980
I should've done things differently.
Okay?

52:54.004 --> 52:57.675
I should've talked about it with you.
I should've shared it.

52:58.801 --> 53:01.529
- Carlton.
- No, I should've done things differently,

53:01.553 --> 53:03.931
so if there's anything
you need me to change...

53:04.556 --> 53:05.450
anything.

53:05.474 --> 53:06.767
Let's work it out.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.478
We're leaving Higher Dimensions.

53:11.230 --> 53:12.815
We prayed on it, and...

53:13.691 --> 53:16.026
- we're going to start our own church.
- Henry.

53:17.236 --> 53:20.048
- You can't just leave.
- No, they're not leaving.

53:20.072 --> 53:21.323
We'll talk it through.

53:21.782 --> 53:22.782
It's...

53:22.950 --> 53:25.136
- It's too late for that.
- It's not too late.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.663
I just need time
to understand it.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.099
Okay?

53:29.123 --> 53:31.267
- Just to formalize it.
- Time to sink the whole ship?

53:31.291 --> 53:34.562
- It wasn't God's voice you heard, Bishop.
- Now, how do you know?

53:34.586 --> 53:35.730
- How do you...
- Gina...

53:35.754 --> 53:37.954
- Come in here, ganging up on him.
- What if he's wrong?

53:39.049 --> 53:40.049
You don't know.

53:41.301 --> 53:43.011
None of us... none of us knows.

53:45.139 --> 53:47.826
But you want me to just trust
you and go out and tell people

53:47.850 --> 53:50.328
it doesn't matter if
they accept Christ.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.192
It doesn't matter if they
go out there and sin.

53:52.604 --> 53:56.108
Well, what if it turns out that you
are wrong and there is a hell?

53:57.568 --> 53:58.861
And we are responsible.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.322
Even if I thought you might
be right, which I don't,

54:02.740 --> 54:04.700
it's not a chance that
I'd be willing to take.

54:07.619 --> 54:11.057
You went ahead with this
without any thought about me,

54:11.081 --> 54:13.309
or us, or anyone else.

54:13.333 --> 54:16.354
That's all I've been thinking
about night and day. Don't leave.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.880
It's not us that's leaving.

54:19.214 --> 54:20.257
It's you.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.342
You turned your back on us.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.363
For 20 years, I put your
needs ahead of my needs.

54:25.387 --> 54:27.741
And I put Gina's
ahead of Maggie's.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.492
And I put your kids
ahead of my kids.

54:29.516 --> 54:30.660
I gave you 20 years,

54:30.684 --> 54:34.080
so just remember that it is not me
that is turning my back on you,

54:34.104 --> 54:35.457
it's the other way around.

54:35.481 --> 54:39.335
And I think that you should take a long,
hard look, and ask yourself why God...

54:39.359 --> 54:41.236
why God would want that.

54:43.864 --> 54:46.342
The hardest part about this
whole thing is that you had it.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.137
- You had fellowship with God.
- My fellowship with God...

54:49.161 --> 54:50.472
And it was pure.

54:50.496 --> 54:53.391
- It was true, and you are rejecting...
- I'm closer to God in this moment

54:53.415 --> 54:54.893
than I've ever been in my life.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.395
I love you more than
anything and you know that,

54:57.419 --> 55:00.297
but there is nothing that I can
say right now that you will hear.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.469
You're gonna spend eternity
separated from Him.

55:06.553 --> 55:08.263
I don't know what
to do with that.

55:15.646 --> 55:19.292
- No, no, no, no. Okay, no. Okay.
- Please don't make this harder.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.401
Come on, Henry. This is us.

55:23.779 --> 55:24.780
This is us.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.534
Remember in Jackson?

55:30.118 --> 55:32.579
When they told us we'd never
get white people up there?

55:33.497 --> 55:34.497
Hm?

55:35.207 --> 55:37.084
Or Higher D, that
we'd never fill it?

55:38.001 --> 55:39.586
God put us together.

55:40.504 --> 55:43.465
And we built something
that never existed before.

55:45.175 --> 55:48.053
We got white folk and black
folk praying together.

55:48.512 --> 55:49.596
In Tulsa.

55:51.890 --> 55:53.141
Aren't you proud of that?

55:58.772 --> 56:01.024
It got away from me, that's all.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.069
I just...

56:07.322 --> 56:08.532
I lost control of it.

56:11.285 --> 56:12.411
I'll roll it back.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.128
- You'll pull it back?
- I'll pull it back.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.091
You'll recant what you said?

56:34.016 --> 56:35.809
God spoke to me, Henry.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.403
Just stay.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.493
I can't.

57:03.462 --> 57:07.233
Look, I wanted to find a place as
far away from Higher D as I could,

57:07.257 --> 57:10.719
and it turns out the only spot that's
available is on Memorial Drive.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.639
At 51st. It's not what I wanted.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.560
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.272
It's okay.

57:39.790 --> 57:40.790
Let's go.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.306
You can always change your mind.

58:01.269 --> 58:02.269
You too.

59:31.735 --> 59:32.735
Hi.

59:37.449 --> 59:40.678
- Here you go.
- Carlton, we didn't pay for those.

59:40.702 --> 59:41.912
Uh-oh. It's okay.

59:43.121 --> 59:44.206
You want to help me?

59:45.290 --> 59:46.291
Come on, let's go.

59:47.626 --> 59:48.877
Okay, careful. Careful.

59:50.462 --> 59:51.462
Oh.

59:52.047 --> 59:53.047
Come on.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:01.407
Yes.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.474
Mmm.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:09.897
Keisha?

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.441
Keisha?

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.986
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:18.091
I've been leaving you messages.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.826
No, I know. I'm sorry, I...

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.303
Oh.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.539
But we've been thinking about you.
How... how is Francis feeling?

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.289
Better.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:30.794
I wanted to call.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.298
I try to tell Frank it's
not your fault, but...

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.678
Oh, girl, I can't imagine
what it must be like for you.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:44.933
There's a whole community that
loves you and prays for you.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.520
I'll pray with you right now.
Do you want that?

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.944
Dear God, in the name of Jesus,

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:01.908
awaken my dear sister from
the spirit of deception,

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:05.179
and rebuke the demons
that have vexed her mind

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.414
- and overtaken her body.
- Keisha.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.375
It's okay.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.043
Keisha?

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:15.546
Bishop.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.966
How you doing? How's Frank?

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.051
Fine.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.345
Everyone's fine.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:42.907
Terry.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.124
It's three months pay and
12 months of benefits.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.628
I'll call everybody I can think of.
I promise you that.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.255
Anything else I can do, I will.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.933

Doctors, uh, held me overnight.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.760
Gave me antibiotics,

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:08.635
and, uh...

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.016
They say I'm low on
my T-cell count.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.690
Why didn't you say something?

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.071
Why didn't you tell me
you were getting worse?

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.201
I don't know, Bishop. I just...

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:36.414
I guess I'm just trying to
make it all make sense.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.834
Um...

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.419
Uh...

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.922
I started seeing someone.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:45.631
And...

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:51.471
Misery just... It felt
good to finally just...

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.950
be able to be with someone
and feel like it's okay.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.267
It's not okay.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.356
Bishop, what is this?

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.148
Hm?

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.737
Is this God, just,
like, punishing me?

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.788
Just 'cause there's
no hell, that...

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.500
that don't condone sin.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.130
You don't get to just...

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840
do whatever.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.220
That's not what we're saying.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:35.640
That's not the message.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.562
Well, what is the message?

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.171
<i>Hey, Ma, it's Carlton.</i>

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.359
<i>- What? What happened?
- No, no. Everybody's fine.</i>

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:11.902
<i>I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.720
<i>I just wanted to talk to you.</i>

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.641
<i>I've been thinking
about Uncle Quincy.</i>

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:21.561
<i>I should've helped him.</i>

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.499
<i>Not with getting saved. I just
should've helped him, and...</i>

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:28.067
<i>been thinking about Mama
George and Patrick.</i>

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:29.735
Rudy.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.572
Just everybody I let down.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:36.635
<i>They gave up on God because they thought
God gave up on them, but it was me.</i>

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:37.659
Carlton.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:39.954
<i>Now, you listen to me,</i>

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.831
<i>and you listen good.</i>

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.100
<i>Quincy</i>,

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.603
and Mama George, and Patrick

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:49.339
did what they did and
no one made them.

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:53.760
<i>God didn't put them in hell.
They put themselves in hell.</i>

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:57.847
<i>Now, you read your Bible, boy,
and get your head straight.</i>

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:03.329
You read it and you teach it,
like you always did. You hear me?

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.353
Yes, Ma.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.261
Thank you.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.560
Thank you.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:50.817
- You didn't have to do this.
- Oh, are you kidding?

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:53.003
I'm proud of you.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:55.530
I don't know, it's
just a clerical job.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.490
Something to celebrate.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.835
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.022
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:14.275
Everything's gonna
go back to normal.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:16.634
- I hope not.
- Huh?

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.636
Well...

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.116
you preach differently now.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.017
- It feels more connected.
- Gina...

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.703
The church is
three-quarters empty.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:28.956
Okay, so let's find
a smaller space.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.082
You said you were worried
about the mortgage.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.107
Just...

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.736
Just support me, okay?

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:36.964
I am supporting you.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:39.049
Well, it don't feel like it.
Feels like...

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.926
you're asking me to crawl
back to some storefront,

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.511
preach to 20 people, and...

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.912
talking about...

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.956
Crawl back?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.625
Wow.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.712
Let's just order.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.865
<i>The theology doesn't surprise me.
Why would it?</i>

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.783
<i>We've been preaching this kind
of inclusion for over a decade.</i>

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.102
<i>The only surprise is
who's preaching it.</i>

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.913
<i>Bishop Pearson is
just articulating</i>

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.667
<i>what a lot of people in
the church really think.</i>

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:16.045
I never thought she'd
be agreeing with me.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.319
Who'd have thought?

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.617
I told you Julian I'd take
him to his game today.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:26.453
<i>Bishop Ellis is on the line.</i>

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.290
Yeah, put him on.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.895
Bishop Ellis, how are you?

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:36.381
- Bishop, thanks for taking my call.
<i>- Not at all.</i>

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:38.841
What can I do for you?

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:44.096
Well, we're having our annual
conference here next month and, uh...

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.684
we've been following what
you've been preaching.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:51.162
<i>We feel we ought to
give you a chance to...</i>

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.856
<i>explain these new
positions you're taking.</i>

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:55.608
In a formal setting.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.420
<i>Well, I appreciate the invitation.
Thank you.</i>

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.321
I'd have to know the
context, though.

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:02.407
<i>Context</i> ?

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.826
Yeah, what's the format?
Is this a discussion?

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.747
Bishop, we think you owe
it to the body of Christ.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:13.751
We're offering you an opportunity
to speak directly to your peers.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.755
<i>Frankly, uh, I thought
you'd jump at the chance.</i>

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.610
You might as well just call it what it is.
It's a trial.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:24.697
- Oh, Nicky.
- It's a heresy trial.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.283
Do you have any idea what kind of
circus they're putting together?

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.351
This was J.D. Ellis last week.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:35.416
"If Bishop Pearson is taking
the position we think he is,

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.419
he will be no more welcome
at African-American pulpits

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.421
than Louis Farrakhan."

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:42.172
I'm not intimidated
by these guys.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:43.424
That's not the point.

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:44.967
- Just ignore them.
- I can't.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.428
Then put out a statement
rejecting their legitimacy.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.596
The Joint Council of
African-American Bishops?

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.850
- You want me to deny they're legitimate?
- No, but we don't need them.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:55.519
Look, our numbers have leveled out.
The church is stable now.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:57.563
If I can go there and get
them to understand...

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.255
That's not gonna happen.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.569
Bishop, the members that we
have now, they're loyal to you.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.488
But most of that's just racial. I
mean, Henry took all the white folk.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:09.891
If you go down there and you
make some kind of stand-off...

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.266
and...

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.245
and you lose,

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.854
then we could lose the church.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:17.523
This is God's will. He's
not gonna take my church.

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:19.859
What if he does?

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.046
How many people did
Jesus lose, huh?

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.281
Five thousand, in a day.
He back down?

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:27.426
God spoke to me.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.927
And I'm not backing down.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:32.271
Now, either you're with me or you're not,
but if you're not strong enough, Reggie...

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.134
This is a gift.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.972
It's how we win the
congregation back.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.058
Okay?

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.855
You know I love you, Bishop.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:05.947
Then wish me luck.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.138
<i>There has been...</i>

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:17.852
<i>considerable interest about some
of the things our guest today...</i>

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:19.854
<i>has been preaching.</i>

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.441
<i>Bishop Pearson is
no stranger to us.</i>

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.320
<i>We valued his contribution
to the Body of Christ.</i>

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.117
<i>So I thought it'd
be important...</i>

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.995
<i>before we make a judgment...</i>

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.415
for us to bring him
to the pulpit.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.209
And let him speak for himself.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.462
Bishop Pearson?

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.357
I was counseled not
to come here today.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:09.736
I've been...

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.451
spending a lot of time
thinking about this.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.846
I prayed and fasted.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:22.583
I asked God for the anointing to
speak with conviction and clarity.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.127
I studied.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:30.800
Bishop Ellis?

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:33.636
I want to ask you something.

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.075
Is there anybody you've
loved in your own life?

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.642
Anybody you were close to?

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.142
An uncle?

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.145
A brother? A friend?

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.232
Who backslid and is
in hell right now?

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.169
This ain't about me, Bishop.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.629
It's a simple question.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:51.988
I'll get to the point.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.243
My daddy's in hell.
What about it?

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.412
How do you know?

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.979
- I just want to understand.
- Bishop Pearson, we have a process.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.255
How do you know he's in hell?

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:12.776
- If you can't answer the question...
- Bishop Pearson...

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.404
Then either you're not sure,
or you're afraid to answer.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.930
Because he sinned until the day he died.
That's how I know.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.017
How long's he been there?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.394
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.289
And did you love him?

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:27.940
'Course I did. He was my daddy.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:31.444
But he beat my mama. He beat me.

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:34.923
- He was a fornicator.
- And now God's punishing him.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.550
He's suffering in hell,

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.136
he's tortured and tormented
for all eternity.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.703
So, let me ask you something.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:45.249
Would you get him out
of hell if you could?

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:49.938
That ain't up to me.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.172
How about if it was?

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:55.110
If there was a way we could negotiate
with God, with Jesus and the blood,

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.363
you'd get your daddy out of there
quick as you could, wouldn't you?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.599
- I can't answer that.
- Of course you would, anybody would.

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:05.019
So, the question we have
to ask ourselves is this:

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.147
Are we more merciful than God?

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:10.857
No.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.279
I thank God that
reprobate is in hell.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.450
- You just said that you loved him.
- I adored him.

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:21.577
And you wouldn't get him out?

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:25.664
Hell is where he's at and
hell is where he belongs.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.062
This foolishness.
This arrogance.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:33.023
You come in here telling us we
all wrong and you all right?

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.484
Perverting scripture and
arguing that God don't punish?

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.736
It's false doctrine
you're preaching

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.322
and it will not be
tolerated in our churches.

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:41.346
Amen.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.951
We believe if you confess the
Lord Jesus with your mouth

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:48.038
and believe in your heart that
God raised Him from the dead,

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:49.480
you will be saved.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.294
And that is the only
way you will be saved.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:55.712
Amen.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.477
Next up, we have a
six-octave keyboard

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.813
with a market value of $9,000.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:15.565
Who will give me $1,300 to go? I
got 13 over here, now 13-five.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.360
13-five. Anybody? 13-five.
13-five, now 14?

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.070
For $1,400. Anybody for 14?

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.447
I have 14 over here, 14-five.
14-five...

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.366
14-five. 14-five, now 15.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.034
$1,500 over here.
Thank you, ma'am.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:29.788
15, now 15-five. 15-five.
Anybody for 15-five? 15-five...

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:32.082
16. $1,600 bid, anybody? 16?

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:35.001
I need $1,600. I got 16, thank you.
16. Now 16-five...

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:37.587
16-five. 16-five, now $1,700.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.781
I have to go down
to the storeroom.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.407
Okay.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:50.183
18-five? 18-five, I'm at 18-five.
I'm at 1,800.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.811
1,800. Going once, going twice.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:55.171
Sold, $1,800, number 286.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:59.943
Next up, we've got the offering plates.
Item number 275...

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.862
You looking for a
deal on some pews?

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.637
Yeah.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.183
I just... I had to
see for myself.

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:12.104
It's hard to believe, huh?

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:17.985
Did the bank assume
the mortgage?

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:23.282
Make sure you get a waiver of liability.
You know that, right?

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.535
I hear you're doing well.

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:29.246
Got good numbers.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.916
We're growing, yeah.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.544
How many services
you got over there?

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:38.422
We just added a second.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:41.758
That's great.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.138
I learned from the
best, you know.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:47.931
I did.

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.310
You got any anointing
in there, huh?

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.021
Got to get that oil,
get the fire going.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.691
If you ain't got that oil,
God ain't pleased with you.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.699
Excuse me.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:49.827
Oh, God.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.289
Oh, God.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.151
It's all right. I got you.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.780
John, this is Bishop Pearson.
Bishop, John Felton.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.407
Pleasure to meet you, Bishop.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.682
Sorry I'm late.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:59.480
I know, just look at it.
It'll take five minutes.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.275
<i>So, it's 9,700 square feet.</i>

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.737
It used to be one of the
old Huntsfield warehouses.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:10.383
I figure if we build the
stage up against that wall,

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.594
we can put the
offices over there.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:15.662
Hang some drapes on the windows
and lay down a new floor.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:26.507
Could you excuse us, please?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.467
Oh, sure.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:30.969
Of course. I'll just...

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:32.887
Take your time.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:37.642
Come on, Nicky.

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:46.360
What are we doing here?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:48.821
I don't know what we're doing.

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:57.621
This is the best space
for what we can afford.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.666
What do I preach, Nicky?

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.625
Hm?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.088
Tell me what to preach.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.341
Are you saying...

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:14.054
that God took Higher D, and so
you must've had it all wrong?

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.393
You're telling me you
don't think that?

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.230
That's not fair.

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:37.494
I saw Reggie.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:42.374
I guess you two
don't really talk.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:47.546
How's he doing?

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:56.972
He wanted me to
give this to you.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.520
He's moved back to Texas.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.940
He's moved back to
live with his mother.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.197
So, how was the space?

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:01.620
It's not right.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.081
Oh, but Nicky was so excited.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.046
What was wrong with it?

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:14.715
Here.

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:18.554
Don't put that all in your mouth at
the same time. Let me cut it for you.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.436
Why do you think
he wrote to you?

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:32.901
He loves you.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:37.655
I just...

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:43.453
I just don't want him
to see where I'm at.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:48.083
And where are you?

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.421
I'm here.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:55.590
Yeah.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.343
You're here.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.140
Look at somebody and
say, "We're still here."

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:11.148
We're still here.

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:29.958
Get up, Carlton.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.297
Just get up.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.075
Chief.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:07.578
Carlton.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.998
I was so glad you called.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.917
Sit down, please.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.174
I do ask after you,
believe it or not.

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:22.927
How are you doing?

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:26.598
I guess you saw the
news on Richard.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.352
They're accusing
him of embezzling.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.189
Things have gotten pretty
messed up around here.

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:37.983
I miss you.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.153
How you doing?

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:43.699
I feel lost.

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:48.286
I pray, but I don't
hear anything.

01:26:49.496 --> 01:26:50.872
I don't feel anything.

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:53.625
Just separated from God.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.633
I've been thinking a
lot about Ronnie.

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:04.761
How lost he was and...

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.556
how I pushed him away.

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:14.706
If there was one thing that
made me want to consider

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.523
everything you were preaching,

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:22.612
it was how lonely God must
feel denying his own children.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.036
I turned my back on you, son.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:33.749
Sorry I had to do that.

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:37.836
Maybe I didn't
give you a choice.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:47.012
I was surprised to hear you'd
given up the preaching.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:52.160
And frankly, I was disappointed
because you were called, Carlton.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.602
I still believe that.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:59.232
And I want you to know that
there is a place for you here

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.526
when you're ready
to come back to us.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.554
It's a challenge to
be called by God

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:14.122
and not allow it to fill
you with arrogance.

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.753
It is a very important lesson.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:23.381
Arrogance will
separate us from God.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:28.011
And it'll separate us from the ones
we love most if we're not careful.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:52.928
Honey?

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.600
Hey, buddy.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.319
How you doing? How
you holding up?

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.158
What're you doing here?

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.085
How are you?

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:27.546
Well, you know.

01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:30.592
Doctors gave me a
new medication.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.554
I got diagnosed with Lymphoma.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:37.681
So...

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:48.860
Nicky...

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.405
gave me your letter.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:30:59.496
And I, uh...

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.831
I just want to say I'm sorry.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:06.127
And I wanted to tell
you you're not alone.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.339
Did God tell you that?

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:12.384
He still whispering in your ear?

01:31:13.343 --> 01:31:15.095
Did he tell you
how much I weigh?

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:01.736
You know, I figured
something out, Bishop.

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:04.912
You know how you
used to tell me,

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.646
"Reggie, just stay strong and...

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.358
doing gay and being gay
is two different things"?

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:13.528
Well, it was bullshit.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:17.406
I'm gay.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:19.826
It ain't no choice.

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:24.056
It just is. It is what I am.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.081
It's who I am.

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:30.045
And now, God's gonna
send me to hell for it.

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.982
Just as sure as you sitting there
with your jaw hanging out,

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.966
God is going to
punish me for it all.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:38.887
I tried so hard.

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.157
I tried so hard to get saved.

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:44.392
So many different people tried,
but it just never worked.

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:47.496
But...

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.606
you could get me saved, right?

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:52.776
I mean, if anybody could
do it, you could do it.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.155
Will you do that for me?

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:01.116
Bishop?

01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:03.869
Will you?

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.851
- 'Cause God about to send me to hell.
- Reggie, Reggie.

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:11.896
- I know, I can just feel it now.
- Listen to me, Reggie.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.023
- You don't need to be saved.
- You don't know that.

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.900
You can't know that for sure.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:18.384
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:21.596
Look at me, Reggie.

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.892
When the time comes...

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:29.270
you'll be with Him.

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:40.169
Bishop Carlton Pearson.

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:42.714
These people don't want
to hear from me...

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:45.675
What have I got to
say to them, but...

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:49.470
then I thought, well...

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:54.267
You know, with everything
I've been through...

01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:58.980
I do know something about...

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:01.691
what it feels like
to be an outcast.

01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:05.111
You know? And I...

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:08.573
I do know something about...

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:12.827
what it feels like to be...

01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:16.289
to be told you're not
worthy of God's love.

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.959
I've spent a lot of my life...

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.462
living in fear of God.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:27.175
And I preached that fear.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:31.780
And I preached it and I preached
it, and I preached it so much

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:34.557
that I became afraid
not to preach it.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:40.063
Why is it so hard to
let go of that fear?

01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:44.817
Is it because if God loves
everybody unconditionally, then...

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.153
maybe we have to?

01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:49.571
Is that it?

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:56.329
And what is it about loving each other
unconditionally that scares us so much?

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:02.144
I don't know. But I
do know one thing.

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.855
It know it was God's love
got me in this room.

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:05.880
Amen.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:09.175
I know that. I know Jesus's
love brought me here.

01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:17.284
Can I get an "amen" around here?

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:18.893
Amen.

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.580
- Maybe a little "hallelujah" around here.
- Hallelujah.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.040
Oh, I got some, okay.

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:28.236
I thank God for my life.

01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:32.656
I do.
