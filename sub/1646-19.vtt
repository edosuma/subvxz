WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:03.003
Previously on Prison Break:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.337
This is an overview.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.672
That's just the beginning
of what's on here.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.507
You honor your side of the agreement,

00:07.590 --> 00:09.217
and I will do the unveiling
at the conference tomorrow.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.136
I thought we were working
with these people.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.721
So did I.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.763
Damn well almost got

00:13.847 --> 00:15.223
our asses handed to us
getting these.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.850
These things are
for tomorrow.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.101
I want Scylla today!

00:18.184 --> 00:19.769
Vincent Sandinsky.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.979
-Yes?
-Let's go.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.648
What are you going to do?

00:23.732 --> 00:24.774
I warned you not to come,
Michael.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.277
Well, it's not over,
not by a long shot.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.489
Christina Rose Scofield.
That name mean anything to you?

00:31.573 --> 00:32.449
No.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.825
Yes.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.869
How badly do you want him, Mom?

00:35.952 --> 00:37.871
Michael, listen to me.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.205
That's not an answer.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.624
I'll be in touch.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.924
I get the ass-kicking
of a lifetime

00:50.008 --> 00:51.593
and you come back
empty-handed?

00:51.676 --> 00:52.719
What?

00:52.802 --> 00:53.887
Linc and Michael's mother,

00:53.970 --> 00:54.929
she's got Scylla

00:55.013 --> 00:56.556
here in Miami.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.558
Fuel the jet.

00:58.641 --> 00:59.809
We're going to Miami.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.862
The guy knows something.

01:10.945 --> 01:11.863
Hey.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.406
I don't know what else
I can do to help

01:13.490 --> 01:15.408
you guys.
Please let me go.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.285
I won't say a word
to anyone about this.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.745
Never heard
of the name Christina Scofield?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.038
I told you, no.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.372
Never?

01:21.456 --> 01:22.457
Never.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.882
Yeah.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.343
That guy you picked up at the airport.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.595
There's something
you should know.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.846
What do you mean?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.140
He's not
some innocent victim, Linc.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.268
He and Christina
have been exchanging e-mails,

01:42.352 --> 01:43.603
phone calls, you name it.

01:44.687 --> 01:45.688
They've got some kind of plan.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.234
I just... haven't
figured it out yet.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.276
Thanks.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.736
So what are you going
to do with him, Linc?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.573
Leave town, Michael.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.492
Linc?

02:02.539 --> 02:03.665
Where's Scylla?

02:03.748 --> 02:04.791
No.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.209
Where's Scylla?!

02:16.344 --> 02:17.470
You ready?

02:18.096 --> 02:21.724
-Almost. Is that Sandinsky's phone?
-Yeah.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.024
Good luck.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.569
Thanks. I may need it.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.369
It's Michael again

02:41.452 --> 02:43.079
on Sandinsky's phone.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.330
I thought he turned it off.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.373
Well, now it's on.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.708
Track it.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.626
Michael?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.253
Hello, Christina.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.464
I hope
you're ready to talk.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.633
Let's start
with Vincent Sandinsky.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.634
Vincent Sandinsky

02:56.718 --> 02:58.094
the scientist?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.597
He, uh, he's an old friend
of mine.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.724
A bit of a bore,
don't you think?

03:02.807 --> 03:04.851
But who cares
about him?

03:04.934 --> 03:06.895
I'd rather
talk about you.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.272
I'd rather meet you
face-to-face.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.734
Unless you're bringing me
Scylla, I'm not interested.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.154
No Scylla, no meeting.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.488
That's all I can offer.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.657
What do you hope to accomplish?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.576
I need your answer
in ten minutes, and that's

03:21.659 --> 03:23.328
the last time I'm calling back.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.625
And found him.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.212
He's in an industrial park
in El Portal.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.254
Right up the coast.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.422
All right,

03:34.505 --> 03:35.798
let's go.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.552
You're lying.
You're lying.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.678
I don't work
for the Company.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.680
Six words that
never prove true.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.475
Come on, man.
This is over. Look around!

03:45.558 --> 03:47.936
What are you doing here? I swear I don't
know anything. I don't know anything.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.687
I don't know what
he's talking about.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.314
I am here
for a conference.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.273
That's all. I don't know

03:52.357 --> 03:53.524
who told you otherwise.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.151
I do, and Michael's
also full of crap.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.903
He's got no reason to lie.
Actually, he does.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.155
Michael's leading us off
the scent, so he can get in...

03:59.239 --> 04:01.783
He doesn't want Christina
to have Scylla any more than we do.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.285
It's not the first time he's lied to us.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.995
Where is it?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.958
No.
Linc. Come on, Linc.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.626
He can't talk if he's dead.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.629
You got three seconds.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.923
No!

04:17.006 --> 04:18.633
Burrows!

04:22.720 --> 04:24.097
Put the gun down.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.641
Vincent and I need to talk.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.817
Vincent?
Yeah.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.819
Yeah.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.113
We had a deal.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.281
New deal.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.700
I'm taking charge.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.328
Vincent and I
are old friends.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.205
Where'd you find him?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.749
At an airstrip.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.376
He's got something
to do with Scylla.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.505
-Good.
-Then you can help me find it,

04:57.630 --> 04:58.840
can't you, Vincent?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.261
And you can help me
find Christina Scofield.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.598
Dr. Sandinsky has been

05:07.682 --> 05:10.435
a Company operative since...

05:10.518 --> 05:12.228
how long's it been,
Vincent?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.189
twenty one years.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.108
twenty one years
of service.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.278
Scientist, statistician,

05:20.361 --> 05:22.113
expert field
combatant.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.657
What brought you to Miami?

05:28.369 --> 05:30.246
Does that help?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.581
She invited me,
okay?

05:31.664 --> 05:32.498
She invited me.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.751
Who?
Christina Scofield.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.793
I'm working
with her.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.295
Oh, that brings
you full circle,

05:37.378 --> 05:38.421
doesn't it, Burrows?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.173
But you knew
that already.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.299
When were you planning on

05:41.382 --> 05:44.093
telling me that your mother
was behind all this?

05:45.636 --> 05:47.305
We just found out.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.057
But bottom line is you knew.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.808
All of you!

05:55.063 --> 05:56.064
On your knees.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.317
You heard him!
Get down!

06:01.069 --> 06:02.320
Oh, not you.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.406
I don't need
to make deals

06:05.490 --> 06:07.909
with men who can't
do their jobs.

06:07.992 --> 06:11.287
If Bagwell is the only one
who is competent here,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.372
What?!
he'll do it alone.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.373
Are you serious?!

06:13.456 --> 06:14.874
Who do you think
found this guy?!

06:20.421 --> 06:21.422
Where's Scylla?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.840
I don't know.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.801
I don't.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.345
She doesn't tell me
where she keeps it,

06:27.428 --> 06:29.138
but I do know
where she's staying.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.184
A place called Edgewater Tower,
room 1099.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.229
You have today.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.941
One day.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.351
You're wasting time, Burrows.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.603
One day.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.699
You tipped him off.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.869
Wow... wow.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.122
No, Bagwell.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.374
You stay here.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.043
Yeah, Theodore.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.044
He needs you.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.964
But you'd better stay away
from us.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.436
This is where Michael's
signal is coming from?

07:58.519 --> 07:59.687
-Perfect.
-Be careful.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.247
Stay here.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.919
Check it out.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.461
Let's go.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.712
Let's go!

09:07.296 --> 09:08.631
He's leaving.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.265
Come on. He can't
be that far away.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.349
Let's go!

09:24.522 --> 09:25.648
Out.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.334
Let's go.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.026
All right.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.779
Where is it?

10:15.239 --> 10:17.742
You don't really expect me
to answer that, do you?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.619
Actually, I do,

10:19.702 --> 10:21.412
because your life
depends on it,

10:22.663 --> 10:23.998
and considering
your track record,

10:24.081 --> 10:25.916
I think it's safe to assume

10:26.000 --> 10:28.085
that you're always
looking out for number one.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.506
I've waited twenty five years
for this moment, Michael.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.093
There's no way I can say
everything I want to say.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.845
Why should I let you?

10:37.928 --> 10:39.847
Because I'm
your mother.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.058
That's something
you can't change.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.269
It's something
you can't take away.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.192
It's nice to
meet you, Sara.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.818
In some ways, Michael's
done very well

10:52.902 --> 10:54.195
for himself.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.489
In other ways,
I'm not so sure.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.409
Lincoln has led you
down a dark path.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.495
I make my own decisions.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.829
You break Lincoln

11:03.913 --> 11:05.915
out of prison and he goes
to work for General Krantz.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.917
And he has his reasons.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.380
But if you're looking
for some kind of common ground

11:12.463 --> 11:14.423
between us, maybe that's it.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.468
I don't want to see Lincoln
working for the Company, either.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.887
At least you've stopped
making excuses for him.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.597
I stopped making judgments.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.100
Something I couldn't afford.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.060
But that was a long

11:26.143 --> 11:28.354
time ago, and that's
not why we're here.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.689
No.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.316
You're right.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.277
None of us wants to see
Scylla go back to the Company.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.823
So, if we can put
the past behind us,

11:38.906 --> 11:40.616
maybe we can work something out.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.369
Like what?

11:43.452 --> 11:44.745
Like a deal.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.288
"A deal"?

11:48.457 --> 11:49.500
All right,

11:49.583 --> 11:50.835
you tell me
where Scylla is,

11:50.918 --> 11:52.670
and we'll work out
the details later.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.172
We'll go fifty-fifty.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.341
A mother-son operation?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.259
Maybe.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.178
But first... Scylla.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.432
Please, Michael,
I know better.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.936
We're very similar.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.190
I know what it's like
to look at the big picture,

12:13.274 --> 12:16.026
see all the little
moving parts...

12:16.110 --> 12:19.405
How much easier it is
to think after the surgery.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.408
I know you.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.827
That's why you'll
never be able to manipulate me

12:24.910 --> 12:27.121
like you do
the rest of the world.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.167
You're running out of time.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.733
All right,
there's no one back here!

12:55.816 --> 12:57.193
Well, they were here,
but of course,

12:57.276 --> 12:58.611
there's nobody here now.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.154
'Cause that's what happens.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.366
You know, this
whole thing...

13:04.450 --> 13:06.577
it's just...

13:06.660 --> 13:08.496
It's just... crap!

13:09.789 --> 13:11.373
We're always one move behind,

13:11.457 --> 13:12.541
every step of the way.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.002
Yeah, and it's just going to get
worse now that Bagwell

13:15.085 --> 13:16.462
is breathing down our backs.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.422
How do you make
that kind of mistake, huh?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.966
And let that inbred
get anywhere near us.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.385
No, no, no, the first mistake
was working for Krantz.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.137
-Okay, that was the first mistake.
-What do you think's

13:25.221 --> 13:27.431
going to happen now that he's
in town and he has his goons

13:27.515 --> 13:29.809
calling the shots?
What's going to happen now?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.685
Yeah, I should've
known better

13:31.769 --> 13:33.646
than to get anywhere near this.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.273
All right, you know what?
We should go. Let's go.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.442
No, we can't go because you
saw the photos, right?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.402
You saw the photos, so you know
what he's going to do with them.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.988
We should have known what he was
going to do with them!

13:43.072 --> 13:46.033
-That's what we should've--
-Hey, hey, hey! Just calm down.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.785
You know what?
The deal is over.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.119
Okay? You know it. I know it.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.080
Everybody knows it.
We're not getting out of here!

13:51.163 --> 13:53.499
We're going
to take a walk right to the gallows,

13:53.582 --> 13:55.960
or somebody else is going
to stab us in the back!

13:56.043 --> 13:58.003
I did that walk and I survived.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.339
Even if we win,

14:00.422 --> 14:01.423
do we win?

14:01.507 --> 14:02.508
You don't believe
that, do you?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.218
Look, I'm going to do
what I got to do.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.178
If you don't want to roll
with me, that's fine.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.601
What is that?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.603
Rental receipt,
a silver minivan.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.313
What is this?

14:29.743 --> 14:31.579
What do you know about this?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.621
We found a whole

14:32.705 --> 14:33.914
box of them
down in Little Cuba.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.124
Guns, too.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.376
What do you know
about this?

14:41.297 --> 14:42.840
She wanted me to speak there.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
About Scylla?

14:44.592 --> 14:48.345
She said she'd give me
the script beforehand. That's all I know.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.181
She said her interest
was purely scientific.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.893
Her interest was financial.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.687
She came to me about
a year ago with an idea.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.522
Rather than build
our organization

14:58.606 --> 15:00.399
with Scylla as the
permanent cornerstone,

15:00.482 --> 15:01.817
she wanted to use
the technology

15:01.901 --> 15:04.528
to make a quick profit.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.905
If certain
events occurred,

15:05.988 --> 15:08.616
various nations
might feel the need

15:08.699 --> 15:10.492
for a more modern
defense system,

15:10.576 --> 15:12.620
and they'd come to us
for the answers.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.580
Solar weaponry.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.874
Water desalinization.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.250
Now, what do you know
about all this?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.544
I told you all I know.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.174
Well, I thought
it was a crazy idea.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.009
Plan of an amateur.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
But I figured she'd be angry.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.221
She wasn't allowed
to hold a card.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.141
Now, what was that?

15:37.227 --> 15:38.562
I think it's more than that.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.980
Really?

15:41.482 --> 15:42.650
What did
she tell you?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.695
I know how the Company operates.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.490
Shell corporations
like Ecofield,

15:49.573 --> 15:52.201
rampant misuse of funds.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.204
You're literally
sitting on a gold mine.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.039
But your leadership

15:57.122 --> 15:58.832
only benefits you
and your friends

15:58.916 --> 16:00.501
ten generations
in the future.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.087
And you

16:03.170 --> 16:06.340
would like to see
the Company implode?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.677
I want to see
something happen.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.223
You think too small.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.393
Laos?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.394
We'll all be dead

16:18.477 --> 16:19.478
before that pays off.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
Uh, "Laos," sir?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.025
Don't trouble yourself.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.655
Burrows?

16:29.738 --> 16:31.240
I got a question
for your friend.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.282
What is it?

16:32.366 --> 16:35.035
Ask him what the letters
"DMB" mean.

16:36.954 --> 16:37.913
Do the letters

16:37.997 --> 16:40.666
"DMB" mean
anything to you?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.213
I'm sorry.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.549
I thought you understood me.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.973
She said her place was

16:56.056 --> 16:59.101
on the same block
as Dade-Miami Bank.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.646
Did you hear that?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.231
I got it.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.607
He'd better
be telling the truth.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.403
See what else the doctor knows.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.404
No...

17:10.487 --> 17:12.990
What's Christina's plan?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.662
I don't know.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.830
I don't know.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.290
Maybe we should've...

17:21.373 --> 17:23.500
Maybe we should've followed her
or something.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.088
Sit down for me.
Please.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.384
How about I talk to her?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.180
I might have some perspective.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.223
She didn't leave me
when I was six.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.226
Okay.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.198
I'm sorry we had
to meet this way, Sara.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.783
I'm sorry we had
to meet at all.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.368
Michael's been through
a lot in the last year and at some point,

17:58.452 --> 17:59.870
it's going to be
too much for him.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.121
Michael can handle it.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.372
He's never known a life

18:02.456 --> 18:04.208
without change.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.542
Oh, you say that
like you know him.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.585
Oh, I do.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.921
Better than you.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.464
I don't see
how that's possible.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.258
Well, you will
when your child's born.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.556
See, I wasn't sure at first,
but you do have

18:19.640 --> 18:20.891
that drawn look.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.184
And I see the way you protect

18:22.267 --> 18:24.770
yourself when
you sense danger.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.272
You don't even know
you're doing it. It's instinct.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.484
And what is it you know
about maternal instinct?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.613
I've tried to be a mother.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.781
Even to Lincoln.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.908
How can you say that?

18:37.991 --> 18:43.080
You left them without so much
as an explanation.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.581
But if Michael would listen...

18:44.665 --> 18:46.166
You know what?
You can stop.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
You can't justify
what you did.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.590
Michael doesn't know
you're pregnant, does he?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.016
What happened?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.311
Uh... I got nothing.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.164
Hello, Joyce.
Hi.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.957
How are you?
My name is Don Self,

19:27.040 --> 19:28.083
Homeland Security.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.543
Don't worry.
There's nothing the matter.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.211
I'm just here doing
a favor for my friend.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.213
See, his mother
passed away yesterday.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.591
Okay, and her last
will and testament

19:35.674 --> 19:37.134
is in one of your
security boxes.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.677
It's actually box 6468.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.512
Is he authorized to access it?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.264
- See, that's the problem.
- He's not.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.183
But we're willing to fill out
all the paperwork...

19:44.266 --> 19:46.143
I'm sorry.
Only authorized individuals

19:46.226 --> 19:47.227
are allowed to access
safe deposit...

19:47.311 --> 19:48.770
Listen, lady,
I need to get in that box.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.980
Where's your boss?

19:50.063 --> 19:51.982
Sir? Sir, can I help you?

19:52.065 --> 19:54.318
Yeah. I need
to get in my mom's safe deposit box.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.445
Do you have a court order?
No. No.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.197
DMB policy prevents anyone--
Here's the policy.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.656
Okay, I need to open box 6468.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.950
Right now.
Name's Don Self, Homeland Security.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.160
Excuse me, Mr. Frank?

20:03.243 --> 20:05.996
Number 6468 was accessed
a minute ago.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.164
He just left.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.082
It was the guy
with the silver suitcase.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.174
There he is.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.509
Hey, that looks like
the guy from the embassy.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.161
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?

20:46.870 --> 20:48.580
I'm trying to reach
Christina Hampton.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.040
She's in a meeting right now.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.459
If I don't talk
to her before five,

20:52.542 --> 20:53.752
the deal is off.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.108
Okay.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.944
This is my final offer.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.029
You're going to
take me to Scylla,

21:21.196 --> 21:22.781
and then you can walk.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.740
No questions.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.076
No one tells the general.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.494
You can live the rest
of your life

21:27.577 --> 21:28.495
like this never happened,

21:28.578 --> 21:30.122
but Scylla is mine.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.208
Lincoln would never
let that happen.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.835
He doesn't have to know.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.421
Even as children,
you couldn't agree.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.339
You fought about everything.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.384
The two of you
couldn't be more different.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.096
But you know that,
don't you, Michael?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.306
This isn't about Lincoln.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.392
You have blue eyes,
he has green.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.102
He played
with trucks.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.229
You took apart
the television set.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.189
And I don't need to point out

21:56.273 --> 21:58.650
the difference in IQ

21:59.401 --> 22:01.987
or temperament.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.030
You know what
I'm getting at,

22:03.113 --> 22:04.489
don't you, Michael?

22:07.534 --> 22:09.411
I don't have any idea

22:09.494 --> 22:11.121
what you're talking about.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.665
You've always known it
deep in your heart.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.294
You just had no one
to confirm it.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.506
Lincoln...

22:24.468 --> 22:26.470
isn't your brother.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.692
It's true.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.737
I should have
told you before,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.865
but you always
looked up to him, and...

22:48.200 --> 22:51.161
I had no idea things
would happen like this.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.579
You don't know
what you're saying.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.208
Have you ever

22:56.291 --> 22:58.960
seen pictures
of Lincoln as a baby?

22:59.044 --> 22:59.878
Yes.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.213
No.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.924
There aren't any.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.847
Your father didn't adopt him
until he was three years old.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.934
His parents worked
for the Company.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.772
They were killed
in an explosion in Manila.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.774
Aldo brought him home
the next day.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.317
He felt it was his duty.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.362
He didn't ask me how I felt.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.991
I-I never bonded with him

23:30.075 --> 23:31.827
like mother and son.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.373
He was always so angry.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.208
Understandably so...

23:39.251 --> 23:42.921
He was too young
to remember his mother, but...

23:44.840 --> 23:46.842
he always knew
something was missing.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.304
I can't believe
you're playing this card.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.934
I'm sorry, Michael.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.271
But I felt differently
about you.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.232
And you could tell.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.068
That's why
you always felt guilty.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.570
Why you were always

24:06.653 --> 24:07.946
throwing yourself over the cliff

24:08.029 --> 24:10.365
after Lincoln was already dead
at the bottom.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.160
It's why you went to prison
and pissed your life away.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.370
You don't know why I did

24:15.454 --> 24:16.455
the things I did!

24:16.538 --> 24:18.665
You weren't there!

24:21.001 --> 24:23.170
Who knows what
you could have accomplished?

24:25.130 --> 24:28.717
But you always felt like you had
to make less of yourself

24:28.800 --> 24:33.054
to make Lincoln look
less pathetic in comparison.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.932
Lincoln was more

24:36.016 --> 24:40.020
of a brother to me
than you were ever a mother.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.814
You left.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.733
He stayed.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.027
He fed me.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.988
Kept me off the streets.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.532
Put me through school.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.658
How?

24:53.742 --> 24:56.244
By getting in trouble
over and over again,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.371
just like he is right now.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.583
What do you mean, right now?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.126
Where is he?

25:03.210 --> 25:06.713
He's out looking for Scylla,
and he's not going to find it.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.758
Maybe you should call him
and tell him.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.344
Unless there's too much

25:12.427 --> 25:14.763
bad blood between you.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.307
Or no blood.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.420
Watch the guy on the right.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.423
Is it Michael?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.217
It's gonna be alright.
Just relax.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.848
Where is he?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.312
All right, keep up with him.
Come on.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.522
I am. Just shut up.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.155
It's not that I don't

26:14.239 --> 26:15.365
want to help you.

26:15.448 --> 26:18.118
It's just that I hate to see you
go running after him again.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.082
Michael, what are you doing?!

26:24.165 --> 26:25.875
Michael!
Where is he?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.922
Okay. You want
to go running after him,

26:31.006 --> 26:32.674
flush your life down the toilet

26:32.757 --> 26:34.676
once and for
all? Go ahead!

26:35.260 --> 26:36.344
Where is he?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.930
Why don't you tell me
where he is, or I'll kill you

26:39.014 --> 26:40.223
myself, I swear!

26:40.307 --> 26:41.349
I'll kill you myself.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.643
Michael!

26:44.185 --> 26:45.395
Michael.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.772
Michael!

26:49.190 --> 26:51.359
Come on! Come here!

26:52.527 --> 26:53.570
Where is he? Where is he?

26:53.653 --> 26:55.196
Where is Lincoln?

27:00.452 --> 27:01.911
Where is Lincoln?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.330
Alright! Fine!

27:04.873 --> 27:06.583
There's an energy conference

27:06.666 --> 27:09.919
at the Panda Bay Hotel
in about an hour.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.963
He'll be there.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.423
That's the truth.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.708
I'm sorry.
I'm...

27:49.709 --> 27:51.252
I don't know what to think.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.463
Go. Go, go go.
Go find him.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.758
I got her. Go.

27:56.841 --> 27:59.260
If she gives you any trouble...

27:59.344 --> 28:01.054
If she gives you
any trouble...

28:01.137 --> 28:02.889
I know. Just...

28:02.972 --> 28:04.099
go.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.840
You have surpassed
expectations, Bagwell.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.175
You're much more
than an informant.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.595
I multitask.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.723
Hmm. Well, if things go
as well as expected here,

28:44.806 --> 28:46.808
you'll be rewarded
accordingly.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.228
As a special liaison
to the Company?

28:50.311 --> 28:51.354
Yes.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.357
What exactly does that entail?

28:54.441 --> 28:55.900
Well, that would
be up to you.

28:55.984 --> 29:01.030
Most Company operatives choose
their own career path,

29:01.114 --> 29:02.574
though I can't say
what would suit you.

29:02.657 --> 29:07.245
What do sexual predators
from Alabama typically do,

29:07.328 --> 29:08.496
uh, aside from the obvious?

29:08.580 --> 29:12.459
Those days are behind me,
General.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.252
What I lack in formal education,

29:14.335 --> 29:16.212
I more than make up for in

29:16.296 --> 29:19.632
natural skills
and curiosity.

29:19.716 --> 29:23.428
And as you've seen,
my loyalty knows no bounds.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.138
Then you shouldn't have
any difficulty

29:25.221 --> 29:27.474
passing your final exam.

29:27.557 --> 29:31.060
Now, you didn't
expect that a few phone calls on the sly

29:31.144 --> 29:34.063
would set you up
for life, did you?

29:34.147 --> 29:35.523
No, sir.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.650
I'm ready
for anything.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.612
Good. Then
prepare for this.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.031
When Burrows brings
Scylla back to us,

29:43.114 --> 29:46.951
I will fly it safely
back to Los Angeles,

29:47.035 --> 29:51.372
and you will be the one to
put a bullet in his brain.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.174
Sara?

30:05.011 --> 30:07.347
What's going on in there?

30:07.555 --> 30:08.848
Sara?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.019
What do you want?

30:14.229 --> 30:15.980
Oh, please, keep that open.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.149
Why? So you can

30:18.233 --> 30:20.777
lob more accusations
and assumptions out at me?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.363
I haven't made any.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.698
Lincoln is adopted.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.118
And you're pregnant.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.831
You don't deny it,
do you?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.501
You should tell him.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.711
He'd be happy,
even under the circumstances.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.380
It really isn't
any of your business.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.048
I'm sorry.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.300
Sometimes in-laws

30:44.384 --> 30:46.219
overstep their bounds, but...

30:48.012 --> 30:49.305
You know, when it comes
right down to it,

30:49.389 --> 30:52.892
I am the only mother any of you
will ever have, so...

30:54.686 --> 30:56.563
you shouldn't throw that
away so easily.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.106
Yeah, you know,
the only thing I get from you

30:58.189 --> 31:00.817
is a great example of the mother
I don't want to be.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.488
Sara?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.323
It doesn't have to be like this.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.449
Yeah, it does.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.244
And that was your decision
a long time ago.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.495
Sara, can I just give you

31:12.579 --> 31:13.955
one piece of advice?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.878
Stay out of the bars.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.464
That's good advice.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.800
I have friends in AA.

31:28.177 --> 31:30.972
They're only alcoholics.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.308
I can only imagine
what it's like for you,

31:33.391 --> 31:35.143
trying to stay off the smack.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.270
It's morphine.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.567
Hospital-grade morphine.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.827
Christina Scofield will not be
leaving Miami tonight.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.496
I want eyes at every airport
and gas station

31:55.580 --> 31:57.540
between here and Atlanta.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.668
And I want the names of everyone
attending that conference.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.545
I thought you might
be asking that question,

32:02.629 --> 32:04.255
so I called the front
desk of the hotel.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.798
Said I was
from the newspaper.

32:06.674 --> 32:07.800
Excuse the spelling.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.681
These are all scientists.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.724
I told you.

32:14.807 --> 32:15.642
Those are
the speakers.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.477
The names below
are "special guests."

32:17.560 --> 32:19.812
Sounded like bigwigs
from all over the world.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.314
"Frederich, Carlotto,

32:21.898 --> 32:23.691
Linarte, Ban..."

32:23.775 --> 32:25.318
"Banerjee"?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.487
Naveen Banerjee?

32:27.987 --> 32:29.364
Who is that?

32:30.406 --> 32:32.909
The son of Prime Minister
Nandu Banerjee.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.496
He has a known

32:36.579 --> 32:38.748
interest in solar weapons
technology.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.336
This will all be over
by the end of the day.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.179
Come on, Linc. Where are you?

32:54.847 --> 32:57.183
It's Linc. You know what to do.

32:57.266 --> 32:58.309
Linc, it's me.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.520
Call me when you can.
We got to talk.

33:16.035 --> 33:19.622
Mahone!
This way!

33:49.152 --> 33:50.403
Christina.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.705
Don't move.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.123
Or I'll kill you both.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.522
Where is he?

34:26.606 --> 34:27.899
Where did he go?

34:29.108 --> 34:30.026
There.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.319
Where is he?
Right there, right there.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.166
- Lincoln, stop!
- Why?

34:45.249 --> 34:46.751
Wait, wait.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.795
That's the hotel.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.213
The energy conference.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.298
That's right. It's today.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.344
The silver van.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.429
The rental van.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.806
They want us here.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.057
Something's up.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.475
What the hell is going on?

35:09.148 --> 35:10.274
Downey.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.818
It's for a getaway.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.238
Lincoln, no!

35:15.321 --> 35:16.906
- Where are you?
- Running.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.408
Burrows is on my ass.
Are you okay?

35:19.492 --> 35:21.577
I was worried
you didn't get away.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.954
This whole thing
could go to hell.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.122
I'm fine.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.623
I'm right on time.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.000
See you soon.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.670
Down.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.004
Down.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.508
Good girl.

35:39.679 --> 35:40.763
He'll never
forgive you

35:40.847 --> 35:42.473
for this, and neither
will his brother.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.894
Soon, this will all
be behind us.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.915
Maybe I can meet
my grandson one day.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.538
My apologies, Naveen.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.831
Where have you been?

36:48.915 --> 36:50.666
I was told that you would call.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.169
I got hung up on a few details
for this evening.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.171
You spoke with Downey?

36:55.254 --> 36:56.672
It did very little
to reassure me.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.008
I need to speak
to Dr. Sandinsky.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.344
Oh, you haven't heard?

37:01.427 --> 37:03.512
Dr. Sandinsky
had a family emergency.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.973
His wife was in
a terrible accident.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.350
I spoke with him this morning.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.435
He took a private jet out
this afternoon.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.187
It's very late

37:11.270 --> 37:12.897
to be making
these decisions now.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.857
Yes, but you've come
all this way.

37:14.941 --> 37:15.942
You are prepared

37:16.025 --> 37:17.777
to give your speech,
aren't you?

37:18.194 --> 37:19.237
Fine.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.279
But in light of the fact

37:20.363 --> 37:22.281
that I did not speak
with the doctor,

37:22.365 --> 37:24.575
I'll amend my offer.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.662
One million dollars
in exploratory research.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.373
The rest will follow
in the weeks to come.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.167
That's very generous, Naveen.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.086
History will thank you.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.505
Your country will thank you.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.965
See you soon.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.770
May I have
your attention, please?

37:54.689 --> 37:56.482
We're about to begin.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.193
Thank you.
Welcome to Miami Beach.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.361
And thank you for attending

38:00.444 --> 38:02.238
the first global conference
of its kind,

38:02.321 --> 38:05.366
where great minds will meet
to explore our energy future.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.451
The importance
of finding new ways

38:07.535 --> 38:10.496
to power our world
should not be underestimated.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.040
It's running.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.012
They rented this
in Linc's name.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.346
Look at this.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.515
These passports. It's us.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.392
It's a setup.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.893
For what?
It's a setup!

38:36.731 --> 38:37.815
Thank you.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.577
It's five O'clock.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.911
If Burrows doesn't call
in the next

38:50.995 --> 38:53.039
five minutes,
you're going downtown.

38:55.624 --> 38:56.959
General,
you should see this.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.461
...in the city of Miami.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.130
Today, the venue will be
the Panda Bay Hotel,

39:01.213 --> 39:02.381
where security
has been tightened

39:02.465 --> 39:05.051
for the arrival
of important guests.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.303
This includes Naveen Banerjee,

39:07.386 --> 39:09.597
son of Prime Minister
Nandu Banerjee,

39:09.680 --> 39:11.932
who is scheduled to be
the event's keynote speaker.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.477
Banerjee's fragile
political position

39:14.560 --> 39:17.521
may leave him vulnerable
to criticism on the world stage.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.524
He has aggressively sought
to place his ideas...

39:20.608 --> 39:22.360
Christina's plan.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.987
What she needed
to profit from Scylla.

39:25.071 --> 39:29.408
An incident that'll domino
into global warfare.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.494
...a search for new forms
of greener energy

39:31.577 --> 39:33.996
like sun and wind,
and how these ideas...

39:34.080 --> 39:35.164
Krantz.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.375
You're out.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.835
It's over now.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.587
...the pressure of increasing competition

39:41.670 --> 39:42.588
has caused some tension

39:42.671 --> 39:43.923
between several factions.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.132
No!

39:45.216 --> 39:47.927
So far, U.S. policy makers
have resolved to consider...

39:50.763 --> 39:51.931
You do it.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.352
Do it!

40:25.798 --> 40:26.882
Hey!

40:26.966 --> 40:28.259
You need a pass!

40:28.342 --> 40:29.552
At this point in our history,

40:29.635 --> 40:31.387
solar power accounts
for less than

40:31.470 --> 40:34.056
one-tenth of one percent
of the total power

40:34.140 --> 40:35.724
generated in our world.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.352
And in the next ten years,
that number

40:38.477 --> 40:40.187
should increase
to ten percent,

40:40.271 --> 40:41.397
but it's still not enough.

40:41.897 --> 40:43.149
We must strive to seek

40:43.232 --> 40:45.651
new alternatives so that we can
break this cycle

40:45.734 --> 40:47.069
of oil dependence.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.489
We cannot do that
without your help.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.075
So that's why we're here today:
to explore

40:53.325 --> 40:54.326
our new energy future,

40:54.410 --> 40:56.579
and envision a new tomorrow.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.706
Now, our first guest is
an author and an entrepreneur.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.125
As well as having
a notable heritage,

41:01.876 --> 41:03.002
he has spoken to audiences

41:03.085 --> 41:04.086
across the world.

41:04.170 --> 41:07.339
Please welcome,
Naveen Banerjee.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.431
Thank you. Thank you.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.765
Good evening, my friends.

41:16.849 --> 41:19.143
It is my pleasure to be
here with you today

41:19.226 --> 41:22.188
in this beautiful city
of sunlight.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.940
Throughout the United States,

41:25.024 --> 41:28.402
I find there
to be great interest

41:28.486 --> 41:30.613
in the changing way

41:30.696 --> 41:33.282
that we all power our world.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.993
Many times I have
been approached...

41:36.076 --> 41:37.620
No!

41:37.703 --> 41:40.706
...with a proposal
to reinvent the wheel.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.333
New resources...

42:07.441 --> 42:08.567
Michael!

42:13.781 --> 42:14.782
Linc!

42:15.241 --> 42:16.575
We've got to go.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.080
She set the
whole thing up.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.835
She set the whole
thing up.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.177
Do you have it?

42:35.261 --> 42:36.220
Right here.

42:36.303 --> 42:37.638
How'd it go?

42:37.721 --> 42:39.265
The van was there
with the passports.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.433
I just got off the phone

42:41.517 --> 42:43.060
with our contact at the bank,
and they've got

42:43.143 --> 42:46.021
clean video of Burrows
trying to access the box.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.440
He must have trashed
the hotel room.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.775
His hands were

42:49.858 --> 42:52.194
all over the shells.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.904
You see Michael?

42:54.488 --> 42:55.864
He was there on my way out.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.454
Lincoln's right back
where he started.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.124
But it really is too
bad about Michael.

43:05.207 --> 43:06.208
I know you, uh...

43:06.292 --> 43:08.085
Shut up and drive.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.931
