WEBVTT

00:00.211 --> 00:02.594
I think you'd make a fantastic
supervising producer

00:02.619 --> 00:03.670
on 'The Breakfast Bar'.

00:03.695 --> 00:06.371
- Wow! Thank you. Wow.
- Are you interested?

00:07.091 --> 00:09.031
Yes, I am.

00:09.371 --> 00:10.991
I think I'm being replaced.

00:11.131 --> 00:13.071
I've heard some rumours.

00:13.271 --> 00:15.891
The thing is, who would
they replace me with?

00:17.251 --> 00:21.271
I mean, I feel quite relieved I've
made a decision, finally, you know?

00:21.411 --> 00:22.831
How does this sound?

00:22.971 --> 00:24.431
"Hi, my name is Lily Woodward

00:24.631 --> 00:27.551
"and I am the new supervising
producer of 'The Breakfast Bar'."

00:27.691 --> 00:29.751
Surprise!

00:29.891 --> 00:32.951
Job's yours. Good luck.

00:33.091 --> 00:35.031
It's for 30,000.

00:35.231 --> 00:37.025
I was gonna wait till the baby was born,

00:37.050 --> 00:39.002
but I thought you could
use it now to get set up.

00:39.027 --> 00:40.866
- It's nothing to Mitchell.
- That's not the point!

00:40.871 --> 00:43.591
I don't want to be 30 grand in debt
to your ex-boyfriend.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.071
- Hey.
- You know what, Mitchell?

00:45.096 --> 00:47.151
This whole situation
is just getting a bit much.

00:47.231 --> 00:50.911
- In what way?
- You're always here or on the phone.

00:51.111 --> 00:53.178
- This is Anouk. I work with her.
- Good to meet you.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.191
- Good to meet you too.
- This is Pete.

00:55.371 --> 00:57.291
You interested in writing
something nobody reads?

00:57.311 --> 01:00.811
Good. Well, there's a job that pays
peanuts that's yours if you want it.

01:00.931 --> 01:02.471
Thank you.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.711
- Are you interested in Jack?
- No.

01:05.911 --> 01:09.111
If you lie to me, I can't be your friend

01:09.251 --> 01:11.591
and that would break my heart.

01:11.791 --> 01:15.271
- Can you feel this?
- Yeah.

01:15.471 --> 01:18.031
- What the hell is she doing?
- Oh!

01:18.231 --> 01:19.911
Bloody hell! Simone!

01:21.271 --> 01:24.271
So you don't feel anything for me?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

01:41.311 --> 01:42.911
I'm stuck.

01:58.091 --> 02:00.171
Happy birthday, Lily.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.811
I love your face...

02:12.931 --> 02:14.671
I love your face.

02:26.831 --> 02:29.031
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:29.231 --> 02:32.471
You know when the baby is small,
it'll be in with us.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.071
Uh, yeah.

02:34.211 --> 02:35.831
But what about after that?

02:35.971 --> 02:37.631
Um...

02:37.831 --> 02:39.751
Can't we just clear out
the second bedroom?

02:45.311 --> 02:47.451
Have you ever thought about
moving to the country?

02:47.571 --> 02:49.271
Nope.

02:49.411 --> 02:51.631
Well...

02:51.831 --> 02:53.451
I was talking to Lily's dad last night

02:53.571 --> 02:55.111
about the ecohouse he built.

02:55.251 --> 02:56.591
Mmm.

02:56.791 --> 03:01.631
And I think it'd be nice
to raise a family in the country.

03:01.831 --> 03:05.111
You know, like
kids riding around on bikes

03:05.251 --> 03:07.871
and big blue skies.

03:09.011 --> 03:10.751
Fruit trees.

03:10.951 --> 03:13.951
Yeah, I mean, if you get someone
else to pick the fruit.

03:16.831 --> 03:18.991
It's not that I'm bad in the kitchen.

03:19.131 --> 03:20.871
It's just that I'm limited.

03:21.071 --> 03:23.421
But what I do make, I make very well.

03:23.446 --> 03:24.786
Like what?

03:24.811 --> 03:26.171
I don't want you to laugh,

03:26.351 --> 03:28.171
but I'm really good at making popcorn.

03:28.351 --> 03:30.631
So you can open a packet
and put corn into some oil?

03:30.771 --> 03:32.551
If only it were that simple.

03:32.751 --> 03:36.871
It seems, my friend,
that I can teach you a thing or two

03:37.071 --> 03:39.523
because you missed out
the most important step,

03:39.633 --> 03:40.846
which is putting on the lid.

03:40.871 --> 03:43.451
- I learnt that the hard way.
- I'm impressed.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.362
Yeah, the packet says four minutes,

03:45.656 --> 03:47.636
but it's actually
3 minutes and 45 seconds

03:47.661 --> 03:49.001
and that's where you can run into

03:49.026 --> 03:50.366
all sorts of lid issues.

03:50.391 --> 03:52.671
Lid issues? Can you
walk me through it again?

03:52.871 --> 03:54.466
- Shut up. Shut up!
- I get the packet...

03:54.471 --> 03:56.231
- I'd like to try your popcorn.
- No, no, no.

03:56.311 --> 03:58.911
I don't need your judgement
in my kitchen.

04:00.851 --> 04:03.471
I promise to avoid all judgement.

04:15.811 --> 04:18.031
- Hey, Jack.
- Simone.

04:19.231 --> 04:23.091
Uh, didn't mean
to just turn up on you...

04:24.191 --> 04:25.711
...which is also not true.

04:25.851 --> 04:28.091
But I did try and call.

04:29.471 --> 04:31.831
And then I thought I would surprise you

04:31.971 --> 04:34.091
with a thank-you breakfast.

04:34.291 --> 04:38.951
Um, seeded ficelle
and pistachio torsade.

04:39.151 --> 04:41.711
I don't actually know what that is,

04:41.911 --> 04:45.351
but it's not easy buying
breakfast for a celebrity chef.

04:45.491 --> 04:46.871
You don't need to thank me.

04:47.071 --> 04:49.351
I'm appalled at my behaviour last night

04:49.491 --> 04:51.191
and I'm grateful

04:51.391 --> 04:56.811
that you helped me regain
a small scrap of dignity.

04:58.511 --> 05:00.091
What can I do to get you to forgive me?

05:00.291 --> 05:03.451
Already forgiven.
Really, it's... it's no big deal.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.171
It's what friends do.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.777
Uh, call me if you want to hang out.

05:09.802 --> 05:11.751
Definitely. Definitely.

05:11.891 --> 05:13.911
Well, um...

05:14.051 --> 05:17.871
...enjoy your breakfast, then.

05:32.571 --> 05:34.111
Lily?

05:38.311 --> 05:40.391
What are you doing?
I wasn't gonna invite her in.

05:40.531 --> 05:41.951
I'm stuck.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.431
This is a serious achievement.

05:43.631 --> 05:47.951
This was a huge mistake.
Simone is my best friend.

05:49.151 --> 05:51.751
I know it's complicated right now,
but we can work it out.

05:51.951 --> 05:55.171
What am I supposed to say to her?

05:55.351 --> 05:57.351
"I'm sorry, Simone,
I drank too much last night

05:57.551 --> 06:00.591
"and made a stupid decision
to sleep with Jack."

06:00.791 --> 06:02.471
There's a little more
going on than that.

06:05.546 --> 06:07.638
- Oh, Jesus, it's Simone.

06:07.663 --> 06:11.211
Don't reply.
Just talk to her when you're ready.

06:11.351 --> 06:12.571
Mm...

06:15.391 --> 06:17.131
I've gotta go.

06:17.331 --> 06:20.091
Thank you. I'm sorry. You bought me
breakfast and everything.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.746
You can thank Simone for that, actually.

06:21.751 --> 06:24.331
She wanted to surprise me.

06:24.531 --> 06:27.291
See, now I'm even eating
behind her back.

06:47.611 --> 06:50.411
Jesus Christ. What happened to you?

06:55.211 --> 06:56.831
I slept with Jack.

06:59.631 --> 07:02.931
Wow. I did not expect that.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.191
And it gets worse. I told Simone
that I stayed at your place.

07:06.211 --> 07:07.591
What? Why?

07:07.791 --> 07:09.231
'Cause she turned up to Jack's house

07:09.291 --> 07:11.871
and she was texting me and I panicked.

07:12.011 --> 07:13.751
Well, what are you gonna do?

07:13.891 --> 07:15.451
Oh...

07:15.631 --> 07:19.271
Oh, I figure, well,
there are three options.

07:19.411 --> 07:22.151
One, I tell her the truth.

07:22.291 --> 07:27.391
Two... I lie to my oldest friend.

07:27.591 --> 07:33.191
Or, three, I go home,
climb into bed and say nothing.

07:34.311 --> 07:37.691
- Well, I think you...
- No, I'm gonna tell her the truth.

07:37.931 --> 07:43.271
I'm gonna look her in the eye
and say, "I slept with Jack,"

07:43.411 --> 07:45.511
and then beg for forgiveness.

07:45.711 --> 07:47.511
Bloody hell, Lil. Just be careful.

07:47.711 --> 07:49.871
You know, once you say it,
you can't take it back.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.871
She's my oldest friend.

07:55.011 --> 07:57.311
I hate myself.

07:58.991 --> 08:00.631
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:00.831 --> 08:02.431
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

08:02.471 --> 08:04.631
Well, I didn't want
to announce it at your party,

08:04.771 --> 08:06.231
but I got a place.

08:06.431 --> 08:08.169
- Move in next week.
- Wow!

08:08.194 --> 08:09.521
Congrats, mate. That's awesome.

08:09.546 --> 08:11.406
How did you manage
to keep this a secret?

08:11.431 --> 08:14.511
Uh, just the standard method,
by telling no one.

08:14.651 --> 08:15.871
Does Mum know?

08:16.071 --> 08:18.006
That's where having
a baby sister's gonna come in handy.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.451
I want this place.

08:20.631 --> 08:23.991
I went around to Jack's this morning.

08:24.191 --> 08:25.871
I thought he had someone there.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.651
- I'm a train wreck.
- You're not, Sim.

08:30.871 --> 08:33.910
I'm sorry about last night, Lily.

08:34.051 --> 08:35.390
It's okay.

08:35.530 --> 08:38.551
I had too many shots. I know.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.905
But when I sat on Vincent's lap,

08:40.931 --> 08:43.471
I never thought for a moment
that we could fall over.

08:43.671 --> 08:45.311
I ruined the party.

08:45.511 --> 08:47.591
You really didn't.
I don't think anyone noticed.

08:47.731 --> 08:49.091
I noticed!

08:49.291 --> 08:51.671
And I'm... I'm pretty sure
everyone else noticed.

08:57.451 --> 08:59.191
Sim, um...

08:59.391 --> 09:02.271
Did you stay at Pete's because
you didn't want to come home?

09:03.851 --> 09:05.511
No, we just...

09:08.071 --> 09:10.511
...went back there
and I fell asleep on the couch.

09:51.907 --> 09:53.447
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.907
Um, listen.

09:55.107 --> 09:58.307
I know you've been
thrown in the deep end

09:58.507 --> 10:01.807
and I'm here to make sure
you know that I'm on your team.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.507
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:03.707 --> 10:06.267
And I know you gals
get all anxious about things

10:06.467 --> 10:09.267
and of course, uh, men often
get great advice from other men,

10:09.355 --> 10:13.187
so I want to share with you
the three pointers I was given

10:13.387 --> 10:14.862
when I started working in television.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.540
- You might wanna write 'em down.
- No, it's all right.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.442
- I'm sure I'll remember them.
- Okay.

10:18.447 --> 10:21.347
One, learn how to play golf

10:21.547 --> 10:23.187
'cause anyone who's anyone plays golf.

10:23.387 --> 10:26.707
Contacts are way
more important than talent.

10:26.907 --> 10:29.107
I mean, you saw what happened to Sasha.

10:29.247 --> 10:30.827
You know what?

10:31.027 --> 10:33.827
If she'd spent more time
at the 19th hole with the big man...

10:35.027 --> 10:37.747
she'd have had a job for
life even if she was crap.

10:37.947 --> 10:39.427
- Wow.
- Mmm.

10:39.627 --> 10:43.547
- Um, two. Don't waste time on celery.
- Celery?

10:43.687 --> 10:45.987
Yes, you know, we've all spent hours

10:46.187 --> 10:47.987
chewing that shit and we've hated it.

10:48.187 --> 10:50.827
I'm using 'celery', by the way,
as a metaphor for 'content'.

10:51.027 --> 10:54.887
Now, content matters and celery is...

10:55.007 --> 10:57.247
Well, you know, celery...

10:57.447 --> 10:59.002
- You know what a metaphor is, right?
- Yes.

10:59.007 --> 11:00.607
Thank you for coming by, Eric,

11:00.807 --> 11:03.547
but, you know, I actually have
a meeting pretty much now, actually.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.967
Oh, okay... Oh, hang on!
Three, don't screw the crew.

11:08.187 --> 11:10.747
You won't have to write that one
down 'cause everyone knows that.

11:12.107 --> 11:13.987
Okay, I know this is short notice,

11:14.187 --> 11:16.267
but upstairs have said yes
to trialling a new segment

11:16.467 --> 11:19.107
and I want to focus
on women in the workplace.

11:19.247 --> 11:20.607
Now, I've got some great ideas

11:20.807 --> 11:22.862
and I'm really looking forward
to hearing all of yours.

11:22.867 --> 11:24.267
The door to my office, always open.

11:24.347 --> 11:25.747
Did you actually get this approved?

11:25.767 --> 11:27.387
Not yet, but I will.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.427
Now, smart is what we're looking for.

11:29.627 --> 11:31.467
I'm thinking an international piece.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.907
Women in the boardroom perhaps.

11:34.107 --> 11:36.887
Well, I'm smart
and I don't wanna watch this.

11:37.087 --> 11:40.739
Women hold only 12%
of boardroom seats worldwide

11:40.827 --> 11:42.827
and only 4% actually chair boards.

11:43.027 --> 11:44.483
We could interview some of these women

11:44.561 --> 11:46.161
about how they got where they are today,

11:46.210 --> 11:48.427
the hurdles, the challenges
and the achievements.

11:48.452 --> 11:50.667
It will be uplifting,
powerful and insightful.

11:50.867 --> 11:53.862
Now, the only problem is Eric.
How do we get him on board?

11:53.887 --> 11:55.071
I mean, you know he'll get all

11:55.096 --> 11:57.082
"political correctness
gone too far" with it.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.187
Alice, I want you to talk to him.
Tell him we want his input.

12:00.327 --> 12:01.527
I'm all over it.

12:01.707 --> 12:04.107
Also, someone needs
to take over producing Jack.

12:04.247 --> 12:06.987
May I put my hand up for that job?

12:07.127 --> 12:08.467
Yes.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.987
Also, Alice, I want you to step up

12:11.187 --> 12:13.347
and start producing
some of your own segments.

12:13.547 --> 12:15.147
- Really?
- Absolutely.

12:15.347 --> 12:17.887
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

12:18.087 --> 12:21.027
You're not gonna regret this... at all.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.607
I better go find Eric.

12:23.727 --> 12:26.027
Nikkii, phone mirror down.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.547
Mmm!

12:27.747 --> 12:30.067
- Avocado and sardines?
- Mm-hm.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.147
Can you pass the basil?

12:36.367 --> 12:37.707
Isn't it beautiful?

12:37.907 --> 12:39.987
Yeah, if you like living
in the middle of nowhere.

12:40.187 --> 12:42.467
- Daylesford's not nowhere.
- Hang on.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.127
- Are you serious about this?
- Well, I'm considering it.

12:45.327 --> 12:47.067
If I sell this place and the cafe,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.147
I could buy it and be mortgage-free.

12:49.287 --> 12:50.787
Yeah, and employment-free.

12:51.087 --> 12:52.627
Can you open your mind to it?

12:52.827 --> 12:55.727
Hang on, since when did we go from
needing a spare room for the baby

12:55.927 --> 12:57.487
to packing up and moving to Daylesford?

12:57.547 --> 12:59.127
Can you open your mind to it?

12:59.267 --> 13:00.847
Who am I gonna review?

13:01.047 --> 13:04.007
I mean, there's the same fiddle band
every second Tuesday night.

13:04.032 --> 13:05.822
Why is your first
reaction always negative?

13:05.827 --> 13:07.652
Oh, my God, if I disagree
with you about anything,

13:07.677 --> 13:09.223
then you say I'm not being open to it.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.326
It's like if you picked up a gun

13:10.351 --> 13:13.402
and announced you were gonna shoot
someone and I tried to stop you,

13:13.407 --> 13:15.207
it's like I'm still
just not being open to it.

13:15.407 --> 13:18.707
What? Sometimes I wonder
what is underneath all this anger, Pete.

13:18.907 --> 13:20.879
Anger. Anger's underneath this anger.

13:20.904 --> 13:22.807
And then another layer of anger.
I'm like an anger onion.

13:22.967 --> 13:25.607
Okay. Well, I'm gonna check it out and
Mitchell's offered to come with me

13:25.707 --> 13:27.147
and we're gonna go tomorrow morning.

13:28.487 --> 13:29.887
Has Mitchell? Wonderful.

13:30.087 --> 13:32.707
Well, you and Mitchell have
a wonderful time in the fields.

13:41.007 --> 13:44.367
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:49.247 --> 13:51.887
Would you like to try my gulalung salsa?

13:52.027 --> 13:53.987
Yep, sure.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.087
I know you're freaked out.

14:03.287 --> 14:05.807
I've really been thrown in the deep end.

14:05.947 --> 14:07.307
And because of that, you no longer

14:07.487 --> 14:09.247
have to make any decisions
regarding food.

14:09.447 --> 14:11.347
I'm making it safer for everyone.

14:12.527 --> 14:15.707
It's completely unprofessional
to sleep with the talent.

14:15.827 --> 14:17.167
"The talent"?

14:17.307 --> 14:20.127
Meet your new producer!

14:22.787 --> 14:24.167
Yay!

14:26.487 --> 14:29.267
Oh, what are these? Little cucumbers?

14:29.387 --> 14:31.987
Uh, finger lime or gulalung.

14:32.107 --> 14:34.047
Oh, what language is that?

14:34.187 --> 14:35.527
Uh, Bundjalung.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.647
Gulalung. So cute!

14:37.847 --> 14:39.367
I'm helping Vincent move tonight

14:39.507 --> 14:41.127
so, um, we'll catch up tomorrow?

14:41.267 --> 14:42.467
Sure.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.627
Hmm!

14:49.847 --> 14:53.807
Wow, it... That looks good!

14:53.947 --> 14:58.207
Oh! So when do you move?

14:58.347 --> 15:01.447
Well, it's empty so... tonight.

15:02.627 --> 15:04.367
There's just a few things
to go from here

15:04.567 --> 15:06.267
and everything from storage is there.

15:07.487 --> 15:09.087
Already?

15:09.287 --> 15:11.167
I didn't want to worry you, Mum.

15:13.207 --> 15:14.927
Um...

15:15.067 --> 15:17.647
Wow.

15:17.847 --> 15:20.927
Lil will, um... She can help you
with the rest of this stuff.

15:21.127 --> 15:23.727
- I would just get in the way.
- Mum, don't be like that.

15:23.927 --> 15:26.407
What? No, no! I was gonna
play tennis tonight.

15:26.547 --> 15:28.047
- Mum, you've been amazing.
- Bye.

15:28.247 --> 15:29.527
Good luck.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.007
Yep.

15:34.807 --> 15:36.627
- She didn't cry.
- She's crying.

15:36.747 --> 15:38.287
She's crying right now.

15:47.387 --> 15:49.987
I bet your father knows.

15:50.107 --> 15:52.267
Ha! I can tell by that look.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.447
What? Anthony's going over
to help him unpack?

15:54.647 --> 15:57.647
Mum, Vincent just wants his own place.

15:57.847 --> 15:59.647
And you know what? The place is great.

15:59.787 --> 16:02.407
The kitchen bench is too high.

16:02.547 --> 16:04.207
The cupboards are unreachable.

16:04.407 --> 16:07.707
- And what about the bathroom?
- What about it?

16:07.907 --> 16:10.487
- There are no rails!
- Mum...

16:10.627 --> 16:12.127
Oh, I...

16:12.327 --> 16:16.847
You did such a good job
of pretending to be happy for him.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.987
- I'm really, really proud of you.
- Thank you.

16:22.527 --> 16:24.167
- Okay.
- I knew you stole this!

16:24.327 --> 16:25.962
- Hello!
- You weren't using it.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.267
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey!

16:27.467 --> 16:29.287
- Hi.
- Hi, Lil. Hey, mate. How are you?

16:29.487 --> 16:31.768
I thought a bit of a housewarming
drink might be in order.

16:31.967 --> 16:34.647
We can't stop now, Dad.
Look at the mess this place is in.

16:34.847 --> 16:36.927
It's fine, everyone. Really.
I've got it. It's fine.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.447
I can come back tomorrow.

16:38.587 --> 16:40.407
No! I can do it. It's fine.

16:40.547 --> 16:42.267
All right.

16:44.607 --> 16:46.847
You could come to dinner,
though, if you wanted.

16:48.047 --> 16:49.407
Yeah.

16:50.627 --> 16:52.287
Hey, Pete, where's the lady?

16:52.427 --> 16:55.707
Oh... she's at home.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.747
- Get that into ya, mate.
- Family and friends.

16:57.827 --> 17:00.087
Family and friends!

17:00.227 --> 17:01.767
Hey! Whee!

17:01.807 --> 17:03.807
There go you, buddy. Congrats.

17:11.289 --> 17:13.669
I've had the greatest idea.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.749
You said your door was always open.

17:17.049 --> 17:19.469
Well, the door
was actually closed, but...

17:19.669 --> 17:21.209
So when it's closed, it's not open?

17:21.409 --> 17:24.049
- Tell me. What is it? Tell me.
- Ready for this?

17:24.189 --> 17:26.169
A date with Jack.

17:26.309 --> 17:28.029
Who's Jack dating?

17:28.229 --> 17:30.069
Nobody. But let's be honest.
We all want to be.

17:30.229 --> 17:32.669
- So why not auction him off?
- On air?

17:32.869 --> 17:35.743
A charity fundraiser for, like,
a women's refuge or something.

17:35.768 --> 17:37.876
We could use vox pops from
Dale's interviews with survivors.

17:37.901 --> 17:41.309
- Vox pops on domestic violence?
- Only the positive, upbeat ones.

17:41.429 --> 17:45.286
No. No, Nikkii. Just no. No.
There's no way Jack's gonna agree

17:45.311 --> 17:47.444
to being auctioned off on air anyway.

17:47.717 --> 17:51.409
Well, I'm sure you know him
better than anyone else, so...

17:57.249 --> 17:59.409
You know, I'm just
a huge supporter of women.

17:59.549 --> 18:00.889
Fantastic because I...

18:01.089 --> 18:02.689
There's not enough of them at the top.

18:02.889 --> 18:04.529
I want to be around
to address that, okay?

18:04.669 --> 18:06.389
Now, what I always say is,

18:06.569 --> 18:09.044
"Better to be part of the solution
than part of the question..."

18:09.049 --> 18:10.489
- Problem.
- Problem. That's right.

18:10.629 --> 18:12.169
Yes. You are sharp.

18:12.369 --> 18:13.964
On that note, I'd like
to start targeting

18:13.969 --> 18:15.929
professional women with a new segment.

18:16.069 --> 18:17.269
I like it.

18:17.289 --> 18:18.729
In the past, all the items we've run

18:18.889 --> 18:20.884
on women in business have
had a really great response...

18:20.889 --> 18:23.529
Uh-uh-uh. Okay, you've just identified
a major problem right there.

18:23.629 --> 18:25.029
Problem?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.529
The past. We're all about the future.

18:28.929 --> 18:32.309
What about... future women in politics?

18:32.429 --> 18:34.049
Hmm, too risky.

18:34.249 --> 18:38.046
We've got some good prep
on a domestic violence segment.

18:38.071 --> 18:39.411
No. I mean, really?

18:39.436 --> 18:41.880
Does anyone want to wake up to
breakfast on a Saturday to that?

18:41.905 --> 18:45.689
The new segment needs to be
less about women and more for them.

18:46.428 --> 18:47.969
Like, what do women want?

18:48.169 --> 18:50.129
- I'm...
- What do the partners of women want?

18:50.329 --> 18:52.449
What do the children
of women want? What do you want?

18:54.949 --> 18:58.149
- An on-air auction, live.
- Give me more.

18:58.174 --> 19:00.909
Uh, audience bidding and, um,

19:01.109 --> 19:03.324
Jack cooks dinner for you
at his restaurant.

19:03.349 --> 19:04.869
- It was actually Nikkii's idea.
- Yes.

19:05.029 --> 19:06.429
- But I don't...
- I love it!

19:06.569 --> 19:08.069
A date with Jack. That's gold!

19:08.209 --> 19:09.989
It wouldn't really be a date, but...

19:10.189 --> 19:12.149
- Women love Jack.
- Yep.

19:12.349 --> 19:16.629
A date with Jack, a hot date with Jack.

19:22.109 --> 19:23.409
- Lil, how's it going?
- Hi.

19:23.609 --> 19:26.409
I'm just hoping we can maybe do
some more things from the road now

19:26.609 --> 19:28.809
'cause, you know, Sasha always
said no 'cause of budget.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.424
The budget's still the same, Hamilton.

19:30.429 --> 19:32.164
Yeah, I understand that,
but what I'm thinking

19:32.169 --> 19:35.409
is weather from Antarctica, right?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.224
Okay, so there's the global
warming thing there,

19:37.229 --> 19:39.489
but I'm thinking we can do
a Bear Grylls thing as well,

19:39.669 --> 19:41.444
like, "Oh, no. Hamilton's
trapped in a snow cave.

19:41.449 --> 19:42.789
"Can he get back to the studio?"

19:42.989 --> 19:44.469
I don't really have time to talk now.

19:44.629 --> 19:46.164
- I need to find Nikkii.
- Yeah, of course.

19:46.169 --> 19:47.569
I've actually got a really detailed

19:47.709 --> 19:49.416
PowerPoint presentation
I can email through.

19:49.441 --> 19:50.689
Okay. Fantastic.

19:50.714 --> 19:52.697
Or possibly if you want,
'cause it's a massive file,

19:52.722 --> 19:54.722
maybe I'll do it on a thumb drive
or I could burn a CD.

19:54.747 --> 19:56.387
- For you what's better?
- Either is fine.

19:56.469 --> 19:57.810
- Lily!
- Hi.

19:57.835 --> 20:00.484
I wanna say I was so excited when
I found out you got the promotion.

20:00.509 --> 20:02.869
- You're an amazing mentor.
- Aw, thank you.

20:03.009 --> 20:05.409
Oh.

20:05.529 --> 20:08.129
See ya.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.569
Who is that?

20:10.689 --> 20:12.509
I'll do a thumb drive.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.429
Hey, I've been looking for you.

20:18.569 --> 20:19.989
How about dinner, tonight?

20:20.189 --> 20:21.589
Alice said you were looking for me?

20:21.709 --> 20:23.909
- Yes.
- Yes?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.804
Alice told me you'd had
a great idea of auctioning Jack.

20:31.829 --> 20:34.724
I know, which is exactly what
I wanted to talk to you about.

20:34.749 --> 20:37.229
You know it's bad karma to take
credit for someone else's idea,

20:37.349 --> 20:39.669
especially when you told them
that the idea was stupid.

20:41.139 --> 20:44.159
I didn't take credit for it, Nikkii,
and I didn't say it was stupid.

20:44.184 --> 20:45.524
I said no.

20:45.549 --> 20:48.769
But upstairs love it so I need you
to get Jack to agree to do it.

20:48.889 --> 20:50.829
Why don't you ask him?

20:51.029 --> 20:53.149
You two seem to have
a great relationship.

20:53.349 --> 20:56.069
I thought you were
Jack's producer, Nikkii.

20:56.209 --> 20:57.789
Just a suggestion.

21:01.269 --> 21:04.489
You and Jack, it's obvious.

21:04.689 --> 21:08.349
But not everyone around here
is a "people reader" like me.

21:08.489 --> 21:10.669
So your secret's safe.

21:14.249 --> 21:16.229
Nikkii, just so we're clear,

21:16.429 --> 21:18.557
my relationships,
personal or professional,

21:18.582 --> 21:20.489
are actually none of your business.

21:20.669 --> 21:24.409
I want that auction sorted.
End of story.

21:24.529 --> 21:27.629
You know, I really admire you.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.869
Taking your boss's job isn't easy.

21:30.069 --> 21:33.629
But then again neither is taking
your best friend's boyfriend.

21:47.769 --> 21:50.909
Oh, shit!

21:52.989 --> 21:55.869
Yeah, coming!

21:56.069 --> 21:58.769
Yeah, hold on!

22:00.069 --> 22:02.829
Yeah, coming!

22:03.029 --> 22:04.789
Hello?

22:07.149 --> 22:08.429
- Whoa!
- Hey.

22:08.629 --> 22:11.469
A little bit of mess. I thought Dad
and Lils were gonna help you unpack.

22:11.669 --> 22:13.269
- Whoa, God!
- Yeah, they... it's...

22:13.409 --> 22:15.644
Oh, no. Not helping.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.244
- Mum, I can do it.
- Yeah, no, no. I'm not helping.

22:18.269 --> 22:21.349
I'm not even here. Huh!

22:27.284 --> 22:29.964
- Hey, Lil, we should get going.
- Oh, shit!

22:29.989 --> 22:33.796
Pete, I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot about the gig.

22:33.821 --> 22:35.189
You're not coming?

22:35.389 --> 22:37.044
There are some issues with the show

22:37.069 --> 22:39.869
and I haven't had a chance
to talk to Jack about everything.

22:39.977 --> 22:42.109
Yeah, I guess you gotta
catch him up on your lies.

22:42.249 --> 22:43.789
Don't say that.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.669
I just wish you hadn't implicated me.

22:45.869 --> 22:48.989
I don't... I don't want to be
part of lying to Simone.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.049
I'm sorry.

22:53.169 --> 22:54.789
Yeah, 'bye.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.735
Okay, I've got to admit
it is pretty good.

24:04.935 --> 24:08.695
Apart from the unreachable cupboards
and the benches are too high.

24:08.835 --> 24:11.495
Ooh! Don't. You'll cut yourself.

24:12.615 --> 24:14.615
Mum.

24:18.755 --> 24:20.335
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.095
So who is she?

24:26.235 --> 24:28.415
I'm not telling.

24:28.555 --> 24:30.975
Come on!

24:31.175 --> 24:34.215
Well, okay. I'd better go, then.

24:34.355 --> 24:35.855
Thanks, Mum.

24:37.135 --> 24:38.955
- See you, darling.
- Love you.

24:39.075 --> 24:40.775
Whoo-hoo!

24:49.035 --> 24:51.095
I'm expecting a good review.

24:51.295 --> 24:53.095
These guys should have
made it 10 years ago.

24:53.235 --> 24:54.575
Uh, yeah, I agree.

24:54.775 --> 24:56.895
It should have happened
with their first album.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.055
Are you looking
for anything in particular

24:59.195 --> 25:00.575
or just a bit of everything,

25:00.775 --> 25:02.335
the band, the crowd, the energy?

25:02.535 --> 25:04.535
Start with a bit of everything.

25:04.675 --> 25:06.095
Okay.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.575
There's nothing the music world
needs more than great journalism.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.335
It's the only way
stupid people develop taste.

25:13.475 --> 25:17.055
I guess so.

25:20.455 --> 25:23.415
Oh, the place looks amazing.

25:24.815 --> 25:28.415
I still feel bad about
toppling you over the other night.

25:28.555 --> 25:30.455
It wasn't a problem.

25:30.655 --> 25:33.055
- Nearly killed you.
- It wasn't your fault.

25:33.255 --> 25:37.895
Yeah, I'm gonna blame
that terribly drunk lap dancer.

25:38.095 --> 25:40.575
Ah, yeah, her.
I had a really good time with her.

25:40.715 --> 25:42.855
She's also pretty beautiful.

25:47.175 --> 25:49.315
Oh...

25:50.435 --> 25:51.975
It's too much, isn't it?

25:52.115 --> 25:53.775
Um...

25:58.975 --> 26:02.135
I'm at a bit of a turning point
in my life right now.

26:02.335 --> 26:06.035
I, for some reason,
keep choosing relationships

26:06.155 --> 26:08.735
that are really bad for me

26:08.875 --> 26:11.815
and even when they're good,

26:11.955 --> 26:14.195
I screw them up.

26:16.575 --> 26:22.735
It's really just about me
figuring out... me.

26:27.015 --> 26:32.055
And also I promised Lily I wouldn't
have meaningless sex with you.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.335
Uh, that's a bummer

26:36.535 --> 26:38.695
because meaningless sex
would have been great.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.375
Oh, dear.

26:43.575 --> 26:45.065
- I know!
- Uh?

26:45.089 --> 26:46.750
What even was that?

26:46.775 --> 26:48.350
I don't know. It was
a bit like Zeppelin and...

26:48.375 --> 26:51.855
- The Cure as well. It was amazing.
- Yes, exactly what I was thinking.

27:04.564 --> 27:07.584
Do you want to come back and I'll
show you what shots I took tonight?

27:07.609 --> 27:09.455
I just live around the corner.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.255
Uh...

27:12.395 --> 27:14.055
Yeah.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.975
Pete. What the hell are you doing?

27:24.115 --> 27:25.735
How was dinner with the chef?

27:25.875 --> 27:27.815
I didn't go.

27:27.955 --> 27:30.695
Come inside, you idiot.

27:32.535 --> 27:34.375
Ugh!

27:34.515 --> 27:36.775
So where's Meredith?

27:36.975 --> 27:39.025
- What?
- Meredith.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.215
The mother of your soon-to-be child.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.495
What are you doing?

27:43.635 --> 27:45.495
I'm going to work.

27:45.635 --> 27:46.975
Now?

27:47.175 --> 27:50.495
Today is my first show in my new role.

27:50.635 --> 27:53.895
Mmm, you're gonna smash it.

27:55.095 --> 27:58.127
Meredith has gone
to the country with Mitchell.

27:58.152 --> 27:59.192
Why?

27:59.217 --> 28:00.975
Maybe she's supposed to be with him.

28:01.115 --> 28:02.855
Don't say that.

28:03.055 --> 28:06.095
I'm not sure I'm supposed
to be with her.

28:07.295 --> 28:10.895
That's stupid. We're not
supposed to be with anyone.

28:11.035 --> 28:13.895
Okay, talk later?

28:29.615 --> 28:33.197
Oh! Please tell me
this means Jack is on board.

28:33.222 --> 28:34.490
Nikkii got him.

28:34.515 --> 28:36.395
Which makes him way more
shallow than I thought.

28:36.435 --> 28:38.095
He said he's happy to do it.

28:38.235 --> 28:39.815
He said he likes the segment idea

28:40.015 --> 28:41.955
and he wants to support
Project Safe House.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.995
No one here is concerned
about auctioning a man

28:44.055 --> 28:45.855
to fund a charity that supports women

28:45.995 --> 28:48.595
completely traumatised by men?

28:50.095 --> 28:51.495
No.

29:00.895 --> 29:02.615
I thought I should say sorry.

29:02.755 --> 29:04.775
You texted that.

29:04.975 --> 29:06.955
I know, but I thought
I should say it again.

29:07.155 --> 29:11.495
Now, my first thought
is that we stop all contact

29:11.695 --> 29:13.455
outside of work and important meetings

29:13.595 --> 29:15.595
for at least three months.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.315
That gives me time to consolidate
my career here at the network.

29:19.495 --> 29:21.735
And I also think
the whole you-and-I thing

29:21.875 --> 29:23.215
needs to be kept a secret.

29:23.415 --> 29:25.975
So I really need you
to be on board with that.

29:26.175 --> 29:30.015
Simone will eventually start
seeing or dating someone else

29:30.215 --> 29:32.375
and that will really help
and then maybe...

29:32.515 --> 29:34.455
Well, then maybe we can talk.

29:34.655 --> 29:38.235
- About what?
- About you and I.

29:43.815 --> 29:47.775
I'm not someone you can slot
into your life when it suits you.

29:47.975 --> 29:50.135
How dare you create some sort
of relationship timetable

29:50.175 --> 29:52.335
and expect me to sign off on it?

29:52.535 --> 29:56.055
What we have or had is not
some segment for you to produce.

29:59.375 --> 30:02.015
What's up with the man of the
moment? I need him in wardrobe.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.775
I'm thinking we can ramp up his
hot date factor for the auction.

30:04.975 --> 30:06.455
- Great.
- So do I have free rein?

30:06.655 --> 30:08.615
He is definitely
wearing clothes, Nikkii.

30:08.755 --> 30:12.015
Yes. Oh... Yes.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.597
Have a good show, everyone.

30:30.217 --> 30:34.717
- Good luck, Lily.
- And five, four, three, two.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.432
Camera 2.

30:36.437 --> 30:38.232
Good morning and welcome
to 'The Breakfast Bar'

30:38.237 --> 30:41.677
with me Eric Albrectson and
of course the beautiful Erica Jones.

30:41.877 --> 30:44.557
Oh-ho-ho! Do you know what?
We've got a surprise in store today.

30:44.757 --> 30:47.117
To raise money for Project Safe House,

30:47.317 --> 30:50.357
we've decided to auction off
a studio valuable.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.037
Yes, it's a dinner
with our resident chef

30:53.237 --> 30:56.237
and possibly the most genuine
gentleman I've ever met,

30:56.377 --> 30:57.797
Mr Jack Winters.

30:57.937 --> 30:59.417
Whoo! Smooth!

30:59.617 --> 31:01.657
- Oh, give us a spin.
- You like? Yeah?

31:01.717 --> 31:03.637
- Looking good!
- Fantastic.

31:03.777 --> 31:05.517
It's getting so hot in here,

31:05.717 --> 31:07.637
I might need to take all my clothes off.

31:07.837 --> 31:09.837
Just letting you know
you said that out loud.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.557
Oh, look, it's an absolute privilege

31:11.617 --> 31:14.137
to raise funds for the survivors
of domestic violence.

31:14.257 --> 31:15.877
The volunteers at Project Safe House

31:16.077 --> 31:19.317
give hours and hours of time to
help women and children in crisis

31:19.517 --> 31:21.597
and my contribution is really
nothing in comparison.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.117
Seriously, the whole of Australia

31:23.277 --> 31:25.317
is going to be in love
with him by 10:00am.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.137
But tell us about this date.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.012
What happens? Will you cook for me?

31:29.037 --> 31:30.837
Well, are you thinking
of making a bid, Erica?

31:30.877 --> 31:32.357
Because I would love to cook for you.

31:32.477 --> 31:33.837
- Ooh!
- Well, you're only human.

31:34.037 --> 31:36.437
All right, let's get
the bidding started, then.

31:36.637 --> 31:40.137
Tell our viewers how they
can win a date with Jack.

31:40.337 --> 31:42.257
Well, you can make a bid
directly on our website.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.417
Whoa. 23 bids in the first two minutes.

31:44.617 --> 31:46.957
Australia is frothing for Jack Winters!

31:47.157 --> 31:49.157
Jack, I do have a confession to make.

31:49.357 --> 31:52.797
I am a big dessert girl.
Shocking sweet tooth.

31:52.997 --> 31:54.612
Well, deconstructed banoffee pie

31:54.617 --> 31:56.277
is a classic from a new angle.

31:56.477 --> 31:59.837
Ooh, stop it! My mouth
is watering already.

32:00.037 --> 32:02.557
Didn't expect that to happen.
Too much cream.

32:02.757 --> 32:06.597
Erica, we've hit 2,700 with Jemima1.

32:06.797 --> 32:10.997
Oh, we have Jemima1 in the lead
with a bid of 2,700.

32:11.197 --> 32:15.237
And we're going to a commercial
in five, four, three...

32:15.437 --> 32:17.317
- Alice, can you get me some comments?
- ...two.

32:17.517 --> 32:21.837
Eric, we'll get some bidder comments
down to you for you to read out.

32:22.037 --> 32:24.318
Can you take them down and give them
to the floor manager?

32:24.477 --> 32:27.837
No, no, no, I don't want
to read bloody bidder's comments.

32:28.037 --> 32:30.597
I mean, how is that journalism,
Lily? Honestly.

32:30.797 --> 32:33.637
I know how important
this cause is to you

32:33.837 --> 32:36.517
and I want the viewers to know that too.

32:36.717 --> 32:40.357
Your endorsement
gives our segment integrity.

32:40.557 --> 32:43.077
Five, four, three, two...

32:43.217 --> 32:45.197
Camera one on Eric.

32:45.337 --> 32:47.237
Well, Sandy from Williamstown says

32:47.437 --> 32:51.157
she'd like to make Jack
a part of her complete breakfast.

32:51.357 --> 32:55.637
Well, Sandy, that's why we have him
on 'The Breakfast Bar', don't we?

32:55.837 --> 32:58.877
You know, I was auctioned once.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.956
Oh, Jesus, Lily,
can I move off him, please?

33:00.981 --> 33:03.637
- As quickly as you can.
- How did that cattle sale go, Eric?

33:03.837 --> 33:05.372
I need to see the candlelit table

33:05.377 --> 33:07.357
and Erica is to join Jack.

33:07.557 --> 33:10.417
Can you get one of our bidders
so we can put them through to Eric?

33:10.617 --> 33:13.317
- I'm on it.
- This really is a dream date.

33:13.517 --> 33:15.317
Now, look, I have to ask you, Jack.

33:15.517 --> 33:18.237
Our highest bidder, can they
just request any meal they wish?

33:18.377 --> 33:19.577
Not exactly.

33:19.757 --> 33:21.992
You tell me anything you
don't like, I'll work around that.

33:21.997 --> 33:24.677
But I'm hoping to give the winner
some new taste sensation.

33:24.702 --> 33:25.760
Yum!

33:25.785 --> 33:27.978
Hey guys, we've got
a bidder on the line.

33:28.003 --> 33:29.627
Hello there, bidder. What's your name?

33:29.652 --> 33:31.957
Yeah, hi. My name's Duncan.

33:32.157 --> 33:34.877
Hello, Duncan.
Glad you could phone in, mate.

33:35.077 --> 33:38.837
So, Duncan, tell me, why do you
want to have dinner with Jack?

33:39.037 --> 33:40.417
I really like the stuff he cooks.

33:40.617 --> 33:42.857
- Eric is loving this.
- I think he's a good guy.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.317
That's great, Duncan.

33:44.517 --> 33:46.877
Now, Jack, I'm sure
that this is the question

33:47.017 --> 33:48.677
on all of our viewers' lips.

33:48.817 --> 33:51.857
I have to ask... are you single?

33:53.797 --> 33:56.857
- Yes, I'm... I'm single.
- What?!

33:57.057 --> 33:59.137
No partner! I have to say, I'm shocked.

33:59.317 --> 34:00.677
Well, it's hard working like I do.

34:00.877 --> 34:02.972
Between the restaurant
and the show, there's just no time.

34:02.977 --> 34:04.437
- Yeah.
- Update?

34:04.577 --> 34:10.197
Uh... Sassydame86 just bid $3,900!

34:10.397 --> 34:15.197
Sassydame86 just bid $3,900.

34:15.397 --> 34:19.476
Wow. That's... that's a bid of $3,900.

34:19.677 --> 34:24.137
Sassydame86. And I'm pretty sure
that Jack is worth every cent.

34:24.257 --> 34:26.357
Oh, Duncan, did you hear that?

34:26.556 --> 34:27.972
Can you give me Sassydame's
email address?

34:27.976 --> 34:29.317
There you go.

34:29.516 --> 34:30.992
You're no longer the leading bid!

34:30.996 --> 34:32.532
Dale, can you take over
for five minutes?

34:32.536 --> 34:33.737
Sure.

34:35.077 --> 34:37.637
- Lils, did you see?
- You have to stop bidding.

34:37.837 --> 34:40.157
- Why?
- You just... You can't.

34:40.357 --> 34:42.476
- It's perfect.
- It's a televised dinner.

34:42.677 --> 34:44.476
- I know.
- A televised dinner!

34:44.677 --> 34:46.437
Not the way to try and get back together

34:46.637 --> 34:48.077
when it already didn't work out.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.197
Did Jack tell you to call me?

34:50.397 --> 34:52.777
No, no, he didn't, Sim. I just...

34:52.976 --> 34:54.777
I don't want you to embarrass yourself.

34:54.897 --> 34:56.597
I don't care if I look stupid.

34:56.797 --> 35:00.357
Jack was great to me
and, in a way, I rejected him.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.137
I want to do something to fix that.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.357
What will you do,
go on TV and say you're sorry

35:04.557 --> 35:06.597
for doing coke and sleeping with Lucas?

35:06.737 --> 35:08.357
What's going on, Lil?

35:08.497 --> 35:10.237
Has he spoken to you

35:10.437 --> 35:12.317
since you turned up
at his house with breakfast?

35:12.357 --> 35:14.777
No, he hasn't.
Please, Sim, just leave it alone.

35:14.957 --> 35:17.797
I don't... I don't want you
to be embarrassed.

35:18.997 --> 35:21.237
How do you know I brought him breakfast?

35:24.257 --> 35:25.997
Lily.

35:29.797 --> 35:31.477
Sim...

35:36.577 --> 35:37.777
Yep.

35:39.707 --> 35:43.307
I'll eat anything Jack gives me. Yeah.

35:43.447 --> 35:44.787
I fear where this might lead.

35:44.987 --> 35:46.867
- Duncan won.
- I'm pretty excited.

35:47.067 --> 35:49.307
Congratulations, Duncan from Geelong.

35:49.447 --> 35:53.207
$5,100. What a bid that is!

35:53.327 --> 35:54.667
What a bid indeed.

35:54.867 --> 35:57.067
Hey, Duncan, make sure you get
your money's worth.

35:57.207 --> 35:58.787
And I was right.

35:58.987 --> 36:00.267
What do you mean by that, Eric?

36:00.467 --> 36:02.507
Like to be a fly
on the wall on that date!

36:02.707 --> 36:05.027
Oh, God, get off Eric.
He's gonna say something homophobic.

36:05.067 --> 36:08.927
Jack, can you give me
a wind-up for about 30 seconds?

36:09.047 --> 36:10.567
To everyone who bid today,

36:10.767 --> 36:13.327
I'm humbled by the interest you've
shown in Project Safe House...

36:13.447 --> 36:14.987
Look at that dimple!

36:15.187 --> 36:16.987
There is nothing more important to me

36:17.187 --> 36:19.627
than getting men in behind
the campaign to stop violence.

36:19.827 --> 36:21.707
Duncan, you took the lead here, mate,

36:21.907 --> 36:23.902
so you sound like you're
definitely my kind of guy.

36:23.907 --> 36:25.227
Look forward to meeting you soon.

36:25.407 --> 36:28.667
Bring on the pink dollar
sponsors, people!

36:28.867 --> 36:31.707
Erica, back to you.
Do not let Eric say anything.

36:31.907 --> 36:33.787
- Camera one.
- Thank you, everyone.

36:33.907 --> 36:35.987
And thank you to our ever generous chef.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.467
Enjoy your Saturday.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.927
We'll be back tomorrow morning
with Jack to spice up your weekend.

36:41.107 --> 36:42.707
'Bye!

36:42.907 --> 36:45.507
That was a great first show, Lily.

36:45.647 --> 36:47.207
Thanks to all of you.

37:14.347 --> 37:16.427
Sim...

37:18.487 --> 37:21.707
Sim, I'm really, really sorry.

37:21.847 --> 37:23.787
It was a huge, stupid mistake

37:23.987 --> 37:26.867
and it will never
happen again, I promise.

37:28.147 --> 37:30.107
The problem is, Lil...

37:31.227 --> 37:33.787
it's not about the sex.

37:33.927 --> 37:35.387
You lied to me.

37:35.527 --> 37:37.027
I know. I wanted to tell you.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.667
But I...

37:39.867 --> 37:42.067
I didn't want to ruin our friendship.

37:43.547 --> 37:48.307
What about Jack?
He must have been in on it.

37:49.427 --> 37:51.467
And Pete. He must have known.

37:51.492 --> 37:55.475
No, Pete... It wasn't...
it wasn't like that.

37:55.500 --> 37:59.067
You were at Jack's when I was there.

38:00.207 --> 38:02.207
Did you know it was me?

38:04.207 --> 38:06.347
I hid in the wardrobe.

38:11.767 --> 38:14.927
You're pathetic. I...

38:18.647 --> 38:20.347
Do you love him?

38:22.327 --> 38:25.147
Do you love Jack?

38:25.347 --> 38:30.347
'Cause that's the only way
that this will make any sense.

38:30.487 --> 38:32.467
I don't... I don't know what to say.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.627
I'll do anything,
I'll do anything, please.

38:35.827 --> 38:40.567
You used to say that I had
bad taste in boyfriends.

38:41.747 --> 38:46.747
But maybe the real problem
was just... bad taste in friends.

38:48.707 --> 38:50.627
I'm sorry.

38:50.767 --> 38:52.627
I can't.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:20.067 --> 39:24.147
I get it. You don't want
to move to the country.

39:24.347 --> 39:26.667
- It's just my life's here.
- Yeah.

39:26.867 --> 39:30.907
- My dad, my friends, my work...
- Yeah, yeah. Look, I get it.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.847
What do we have in common, Meredith?

39:50.687 --> 39:54.027
A baby.

39:55.147 --> 39:57.027
We have a baby in common.

40:24.107 --> 40:29.707
I went out to a gig last night
and got way too drunk.

40:29.907 --> 40:32.227
- Okay.
- No, it gets worse.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.027
I... I kissed a girl from work

40:36.227 --> 40:38.987
and she invited me back,
but I didn't go.

40:39.127 --> 40:41.207
I stayed at Lily's.

40:42.987 --> 40:44.567
Are you mad?

40:44.687 --> 40:46.947
No.

40:47.147 --> 40:50.787
Are you gonna keep
being weird about Mitchell?

40:52.107 --> 40:54.267
Only if you move to Daylesford with him.

41:02.147 --> 41:06.907
Okay, I... I might have put
my hands down Anouk's pants,

41:07.107 --> 41:09.987
but I thought about having sex
with her, didn't do it.

41:10.127 --> 41:12.927
Have sex with me.
