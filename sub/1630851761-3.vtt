00:13.416 --> 00:14.375
Thank you guys.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.708
I don't know what happened
over at Netflix,

00:16.791 --> 00:20.083
but big mitzvah that you
brought it over here to Hulu.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.333
-We're so happy to be here.
-JEFF GREENE: So happy.

00:22.416 --> 00:24.916
So, let's, uh,
let's talk tachles.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.166
-What is that?
-Tachles, real talk. (SNAPS)

liked it, didn't love it.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.875
Oh, so you didn't like it?

00:34.958 --> 00:36.208
-No, no.
-No, no.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.958
That's not what we're saying.
I liked it. They liked it.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.958
-EXEC 1: Mm-hmm.
-They liked it?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.250
Or they liked it?

00:42.333 --> 00:44.500
-All three of them.
-I'm not nonbinary.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.000
I'm only a they when
I'm with a group of people.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.250
Are you plural?

00:48.333 --> 00:50.416
-No, I'm gay.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:50.500 --> 00:52.125
And there you have it.
So, casting?

00:52.208 --> 00:54.875
-Yeah.
-I was thinking, for the role

00:54.958 --> 00:57.291
of Uncle Moe, Ted Danson.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.791
-Y-- you can't get away from it.
-JEFF: No, he's everywhere.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.250
LARRY: I can't get away
from him!

01:01.333 --> 01:03.583
Am I right? I mean, anything
he touches turns to comedy gold.

01:03.666 --> 01:06.250
I don't know.
He's not really the right type.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.583
We like Ted. But what do I know?
I'm just a Jew from the Valley.

01:09.666 --> 01:10.750
(LAUGHTER)

01:10.833 --> 01:13.000
You know, it's somebody
we could consider for sure.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.750
-I'll tell you what, though.
-JAKE: Okay.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.958
I've got somebody
for Marsha Lifshitz

01:18.041 --> 01:19.583
who's a discovery.

01:19.666 --> 01:21.833
-Oh. Wow. Okay.
-(EXCITED LAUGHTER)

And her name
is Maria Sofia Estrada,

01:25.250 --> 01:27.625
-and she's fantastic.
-Great.

01:27.708 --> 01:31.000
I was just wondering,
uh, is she Jewish?

01:31.083 --> 01:32.666
Oh, you can't ask that.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.458
-Uh-- Oh, okay. Um...
-JAKE: No, it's okay in
this office. You can ask that.

01:34.541 --> 01:36.000
Why can't she ask that?

01:36.083 --> 01:37.375
I think it's illegal.

01:37.458 --> 01:38.916
Get the fuck out of here!
"Illegal"!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.166
Well, well, listen,
if you like her, we like her.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.833
Just-- can we see some tape?

01:43.541 --> 01:44.875
-See what?
-JAKE: Tape.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.958
That's the process,
it's that, you know,

01:47.041 --> 01:48.666
we'd like to give it the old...

01:49.708 --> 01:51.791

-JEFF: Well...

01:51.875 --> 01:54.833
-It's a visual medium,
this TV thing.
-EXEC 1: Yeah.

Uh, that's great,
we'll get 'em tape.

01:56.833 --> 01:57.833
We'll get 'em tape.

(LAUGHTER)

02:09.958 --> 02:11.833
-Because it's my office.
-Yeah, only you do that, yeah.

-Hey, Larry,

02:13.125 --> 02:15.083
come for Shabbos dinner
one of these weekends.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.916
-Hmm.
-Ow.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.250
-Did that guy ever do stand-up?
-Not to my knowledge,

02:26.333 --> 02:27.833
and if he did,
he couldn't have been good.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.125
God, he really leans
into that Jew stuff,

02:30.208 --> 02:31.208
-doesn't he?
-Boy, oh, boy.

02:31.291 --> 02:33.500
Just like a bad comic.
Every other word is

02:33.583 --> 02:34.958
-Jew this, Jew that.
-JEFF: Jew this, Jew that.

02:35.041 --> 02:36.458
-Yeah, I know.
-Oh, my God.

-(PHONE DINGS)
-Terrible.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.708
Did you slam the door
on your, uh, way out?

02:42.791 --> 02:44.083
-No.
-I just got a text

02:44.166 --> 02:46.666
from them upstairs saying,
"Is Larry mad?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.583
He slammed the door
when he left."

02:48.666 --> 02:49.916
No, I'm not mad. You know,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.875
it's hard to gauge a door
you're unfamiliar with.

02:52.958 --> 02:55.250
(CHUCKLES) In the future,
I promise I'll try and be

02:55.333 --> 02:57.458
a little more considerate
with my door closing.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.208
Um, what the hell
we gonna do about this tape?

03:01.291 --> 03:04.833
I mean, she's just...
She stinks to high heaven.

03:04.916 --> 03:07.791
What about an acting coach?
Acting class?

03:08.750 --> 03:11.250
Cheryl teaches acting now.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.125
-You're kidding me?
-No. Great idea,

03:13.208 --> 03:14.625
-let's ask Cheryl.
-Let's ask Cheryl.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.416
-She'll keep it on the q.t.
-LARRY: Yeah. Absolutely.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.375
(DOOR OPENS)

-LARRY: Hello!
-CHERYL DAVID: Ha.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.791
What are you doing here?

03:20.875 --> 03:24.875
Uh, I have a little, uh, thing
I need to discuss with you.

03:24.958 --> 03:27.500
-Why didn't you text me?
-I could've.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.583
But then, you know,
I would've missed that--

03:29.666 --> 03:32.458
that look of disappointment
wash over your face

03:32.541 --> 03:35.458
when you opened the door,
and that was priceless.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.375
-Do you wanna come in?
-LARRY: Sure.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.583
All right. Please.

03:40.958 --> 03:44.041
LARRY: What's that?
Hot dog eating contest?

03:44.125 --> 03:46.625
This Friday? So disgusting.

03:46.708 --> 03:47.875
CHERYL: That's so gross.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.416
You know,
women do these now too.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.750
-Hmm!
-LARRY: That would be fun,

03:50.833 --> 03:53.666
to date a woman hot dog eater.
Take her out to dinner.

03:53.750 --> 03:57.250
"I'll have a salmon.
She'll have 32 hot dogs!" Yeah.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.416
Um, why are you here?

04:00.500 --> 04:02.833
Well, you know that,
uh, pilot I'm doing?

04:02.916 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.916
-There's an actress in the show.
-Okay.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.791
Oh, God, how do I even say this?
Well, she stinks.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.458
-But you cast her?
-Yeah. Yeah.

04:12.541 --> 04:14.291
Well, why would you cast her
if she's not good?

04:14.375 --> 04:17.041
I can't get into all this now.
Suffice it to say,

04:17.125 --> 04:18.458
she has to be in the show,

04:18.541 --> 04:21.041
and she has to be
better than she is.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.291
-Okay.
-And we need to have a good tape

04:23.375 --> 04:26.250
-for her, to show Hulu.
-All right, easy.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.916
No. It's not gonna be easy.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.250
I mean,
we can set up the camera and--

04:32.333 --> 04:34.375
-and make a nice tape for Hulu.
-Great.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.916
-And they'll be thrilled.
-Yeah.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.208
-Yeah, well...
-You know, we'll just, like,

04:37.291 --> 04:39.208
work on the dialogue
a little bit, and we'll do some

04:39.291 --> 04:42.250
serious character study.
Maybe do some vocal exercises

04:42.333 --> 04:44.458
-that can help.
-Okay, please,
spare me the bullshit.

04:44.541 --> 04:47.458
Just... Thank you, thank you.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.958
It's not bullshit. It's actually
technique that people--

05:00.000 --> 05:01.541
So you guys
are getting the emails

05:01.625 --> 05:02.791
from my office every month?

05:02.875 --> 05:04.375
-I don't read 'em, no.
-JEFF: I don't read 'em either.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.291
You're my business manager.
I pay you to take care of that.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.416
-Okay, fine. Just wanna know
the email's going through.
-Jeff?

-(SIGHS)
-HARRY: Mm-hmm.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.208
Listen, I need some advice
from you.

05:16.291 --> 05:20.333
I met this girl a few nights ago
at a bar.

05:20.416 --> 05:22.708
-She was so gorgeous, like...
-Wow.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.958
-...way outside my coverage.
-Nice, Harry, beautiful.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.875
She just gave me her number,
so then I gave her my number.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.125
-Look at you!
-But then, when I'm going home,

05:31.208 --> 05:33.500
I just texted her,
"Hey, that was really cool.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.041
Do you wanna maybe go get
a drink Thursday night?"

05:36.125 --> 05:38.416
And she immediately replied,
"Oh, yes."

05:38.500 --> 05:40.375
Just... (SNAPS)
...bam, right there.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.208
Then I got greedy
and I texted back,

05:45.291 --> 05:48.000
"How about some food to go
with those drinks?"

05:48.083 --> 05:49.125
Oh, no.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.541
She hasn't texted me back
in two days.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.750
-Oh, God. You pushed the dinner.
-So, I-- I blew it, right?

05:54.833 --> 05:56.666
I scared the rabbit away
and ran at it.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.208
The desperation came through.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.666
-HARRY: It came through.
-You couldn't contain it.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.541
I don't know what to do.
What can--

06:01.625 --> 06:04.333
-Oh, boy. Harry.
-Do you have any ideas?

06:04.416 --> 06:06.291
Well, you gotta send her
something funny.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.250
-It's got to be funny.
-Something funny, okay.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, it's got to be
a funny text.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.625
-I think I might have something.
-What?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.375
Say, "Actually..."
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:18.708 --> 06:21.291
"I can't have dinner
on Thursday."

06:21.375 --> 06:22.541
Okay.

06:22.625 --> 06:25.708
"Because I'm in a hot dog
eating contest the next day,

06:25.791 --> 06:28.208
and I don't wanna ruin
my appetite."

06:28.291 --> 06:30.125
-It's funny.
-I'm gonna fucking send it.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.625
You're saying,
"Hey, I fucked up." Okay?

06:31.708 --> 06:32.875
-I fucked up 'cause of the--
-Yeah.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.083
-Wait, wait, wait.
-"I fucked up, but here's--

06:34.166 --> 06:35.458

but I'm a funny guy."

06:41.166 --> 06:42.416
-Mwah.
-Thanks for having me.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.291
-How's the mattress world?
-Still the mattress champ.

06:44.375 --> 06:45.708
Just opened a new outlet
in Victorville.

06:45.791 --> 06:47.000
That's fantastic.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.166
I'm putting super homies
in mattresses. I'm killing it.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.166
-Wow.
-Honestly.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.416
But the thing I'm doing now,

06:51.500 --> 06:53.541
which is a little bit
more creative, is a hotel.

06:53.625 --> 06:54.875
-What hotel?
-The Funkhouse.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.750
It's Beverly Hills adjacent,
so it's kind of a boutique.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.916
It's an interesting space.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.166
I wanna hear everything.
I got stuff in the oven.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.375
-Go.
-Go get yourself a drink,

07:01.458 --> 07:03.166
-and we'll talk later.
-Okay, sounds reasonable.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.541
Thanks again for having me.
You look terrific.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.166
I'm putting half of your
portfolio into cryptocurrency.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.375
-Hey, guys.
-LARRY: Hey.

07:07.458 --> 07:10.166
I'm kidding,
it's all nerds and Nazis.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.916
-Hey. Hi.
-Hey, hey! My man, how are you?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.166
What's this about
a hotel you're...?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.750
-Yeah.
-You bought a hotel?

07:17.833 --> 07:19.666
I'm doing the whole thing.
It's exciting, huh?

07:19.750 --> 07:20.916
-That's amazing,
-It is. It's amazing.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.375
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, thank you.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.291
Well, you know, we'll see how
it goes, but I feel very good.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.333
What-- what are you doing
about the minibar?

07:26.416 --> 07:27.625
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do

07:27.708 --> 07:30.125
about the minibar?
I don't know, it's a minibar.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.000
They're kind of fascinating
to me, the minibars.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.916
You know, you go into the room,
you're kind of excited about,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.250
"Oh, what do they have?"
Then you see some items,

07:37.333 --> 07:38.791
"I don't know why they got
that one.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.666
What were they thinking about
with this thing?" You know.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.583
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure?

07:43.666 --> 07:47.375
-Suppose I, Larry David...
-Yeah.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.833
...went shopping
for your minibar

07:49.916 --> 07:51.208
and picked out your minibar.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.708
You know, this is a business,
it's not a hobby.

07:52.791 --> 07:54.041
I'm really gonna open a hotel.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.250
-No, I completely understand.
-I need people to--

07:56.333 --> 07:58.791
Why is somebody better at that
than I am?

07:58.875 --> 08:00.875
I know potato chips.
I know M&M's.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.625
They told me not to open up
a mattress shop in Temecula.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.833
They said it's all credit card
junkies and Supercross.

08:05.916 --> 08:07.833
I did it, and guess what?
I'm slaughtering it.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.375
If you think you can do it,
I think you can do it.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.833
I'll go shopping, and then
I'll show you what I got.

08:11.916 --> 08:13.541
Yeah. The answer for you is yes.

-Hi.
-JEFF: Hi.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.708
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.166
I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.250
I gotta get to work.

-CHERYL: Larry?
-LARRY: Oh, hey.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.416
Are you mad at me?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.083
No. Why would I be mad at you?

08:28.166 --> 08:29.708
I don't know,
because I'm doing you a favor

08:29.791 --> 08:32.041
-and you slammed the door on me.
-Really?

08:32.125 --> 08:34.833
You don't hear that
as a slamming of the door?

08:34.916 --> 08:37.083
I didn't hear a door slam,
I'm sorry.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.041
Okay, well,
then you must be door deaf.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.916
Hmm. It's interesting
that you would say that,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.625
because I've always thought
my hearing was a cut above

08:42.708 --> 08:44.041
-the average person.
-Is that right?

08:44.125 --> 08:47.041
Especially disparaging remarks
directed at me.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.750
-Uh-huh.
-"You fucking asshole."

08:48.833 --> 08:50.541
I can hear that, like,
from 50 yards away.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.375
(WHISPERING) "What a fucking--
I hate that fucking guy."

08:52.458 --> 08:53.791
-You know, stuff like that.
-You can hear that?

-Want me to-- Oh.

-Cass, you sit there.
-CASSIE: Here?

09:07.875 --> 09:09.791
All right. Guess I'll sit here.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.250
Look at this!
Look at your leopard... (LAUGHS)

09:12.333 --> 09:14.125
So listen, I'm so happy
to have you all here.

-I wanna do a toast.

thank you all for coming.

-SUSIE: Yes, to friendship.
-FREDDY: To friendship,

09:24.875 --> 09:26.583
and to be with everyone.

-Cheers.

ALL: Cheers.

09:31.916 --> 09:35.083
Larry? You can't look me
in the eye and toast?

09:35.166 --> 09:36.708
-Look you in the eye?
-SUSIE: Yeah.

09:36.791 --> 09:37.708
Towards what end?

09:37.791 --> 09:39.125
Because that's what people do.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.791
-LARRY: Get out of here.
-They look each other
in the eye.

We're raising
people from the dead?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.708
Come on, give me a break.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.500
No, we're connecting
and having some intimacy.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.041
I-- I don't need to connect,
okay? I'm connected.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.833
-What are you afraid of?
-What does it do?

09:50.916 --> 09:53.166
-You're saying,
"Hello. I see you."
-You're saying "I see you."

I acknowledge you!

10:02.458 --> 10:04.208
I connect with you.

10:04.291 --> 10:07.000
SUSIE: Okay, very funny.
You made your point.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.833
-I think you're rude.
-You see how stupid it is?

10:08.916 --> 10:11.250
-SUSIE: Yeah.
I think you're rude.
-It is dumb, come on.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.291
Ooh, so I'm in a bookstore
the other day,

10:14.375 --> 10:15.625
-okay?
-CHERYL: Yeah.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.291
And I'm looking for a book
about Eleanor Roosevelt, okay?

10:18.375 --> 10:20.500
And I'm looking,
and I'm looking under R.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.208
Nothing. I go to the Es.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.500
A book on Eleanor Roosevelt.
It was crazy, it was nuts.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.166
Can you imagine?

10:29.125 --> 10:30.875
You know
what could have happened?

10:30.958 --> 10:32.000
I'm not saying it's definite,

10:32.083 --> 10:34.708
but maybe somebody new
was working,

10:34.791 --> 10:37.916
maybe somebody younger,
and they just didn't know?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.750
You know, that's true.
I saw people there.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.583
Some in their 20s.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.958
Thirties too, couple.

10:45.041 --> 10:46.083
Okay, maybe it's forgivable.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.791
The important thing is
you found it.

10:48.875 --> 10:49.916
ANDY: I did.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.208
And now you're reading it,
and that's great.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.666
ANDY: They don't know the
Dewey Decimal System anymore.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.875
They're not going to libraries.
They're going on their computer.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.375
I decided to go to a bookstore,
and not go online.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.583
-CASSIE: Have you seen this?
-We could get reclaimed wood.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.500
That'll work.
From, like, a gym.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.333
If you're doing a big room,
sometimes they don't have

11:06.416 --> 11:08.541
enough of the same stuff
that matches.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.000
ANDY: If you go to
the right supplier, you do.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.583
But I'll tell you
what I was thinking too.

11:11.666 --> 11:14.375
There's a thing, there's resin.
Okay? It's two polymers.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.583
CASSIE: Is it resin or rah-sin?

11:15.666 --> 11:16.833
ANDY: No, it's resin, R-E-S-I-N.

11:16.916 --> 11:18.750
CASSIE: Okay.
What does it look like?

11:18.833 --> 11:20.833
ANDY: I guess,
it's whatever you want it to.

11:20.916 --> 11:23.875
Cheryl, have you had to put any
new wood or flooring

11:23.958 --> 11:25.375
in your house at all?

11:26.875 --> 11:28.250
No.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.000
CASSIE: That's another thing
we haven't decided.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.541
Dark wood? Light wood?

11:31.625 --> 11:33.000
M-- maybe you could stain
the mahogany.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.958
-But that would be silly.
-So, you know what, Larry,

11:35.041 --> 11:37.333
will you meet me in the kitchen
for a second? I need your help

11:37.416 --> 11:38.500
-with something.
-Sure. Of course.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.208
CASSIE: I like the tiles
that look like wood.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.083
ANDY:
If you get heavy, heavy wood...

11:43.166 --> 11:44.500
It's a fucking nightmare.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.833
-Yeah, it's a disaster.
-It's a disaster.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.458
It's a complete disas--
My dinner party, done.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.708
You know why? Yeah.
Because Andy and Cassie

11:50.791 --> 11:51.875
are in the middle.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.625
-That's what it is.
-And they can't middle.

11:53.708 --> 11:55.541
You have to be able to carry
the conversation.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.291
-Yes.
-You have to be interesting.

11:57.375 --> 12:00.416
You're the point guard there.
You're distributing the ball.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.291
-They can't fucking middle.
-They can't middle.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.500
-Look at-- look at that.
-CASSIE: ...whole family
loves fishing now.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.000
Andy loves it, I love it,
Skylar loves it.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.125
I can't believe it.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.416
-Do you like fishing, Cheryl?
-CHERYL: No.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.166
-Oh, my G-- Fishing?
-Yeah.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.250
What, can we save this?

12:13.333 --> 12:16.208
-I'll take care of it.
-SUSIE: Thank you, Larry.

12:16.291 --> 12:19.083
-It's the bucket of bait, okay,
which is called chum.
-Right.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.583
They call it chum,
I don't know why.

12:20.666 --> 12:24.875
And she takes it,
and she puts it onto the hook.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.500
-She knew what she was doing.
She was born to it.
-(SIGHS) Okay, okay.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.500
-She's great.
-All right. Okay. I'm sorry.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.666
This dinner's not going
very well.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.500
-Oh!
-LARRY: And the reason
it's not going well

12:34.583 --> 12:37.375
is because the wrong people
are in the middle.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.083
(SCOFFS) What?

12:39.166 --> 12:40.666
Yeah. You can't handle
the middle.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.708
-You're not a middler.
-Andy, not everybody

12:42.791 --> 12:44.750
has the personality
for the middle.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.000
It's very presumptuous of you
to even be sitting here.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.125
Freddy happens to be
a great middle, I know that.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.500
I'd like Freddy
and Cassie to switch,

12:50.583 --> 12:52.000
and I'd like Andy
and Larry to switch.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.041
It's your house. I have told
these stories before

12:55.125 --> 12:56.458
and got laughs!

12:56.541 --> 12:58.041
-SUSIE: Separated.
Thank you, Cheryl.
-CHERYL: You're welcome.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.125
Anyway, let me just finish
the story.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.625
-ALL: No!
-No more boat.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.208
-SUSIE: We're done.
-I'll tell you later.
Okay. I'll finish.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.500
-All right.
-Okay.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.791
This is how you middle. Okay?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.583
Guess who I ran into today.

13:09.666 --> 13:11.791
-ALL: Who?
-Callie Lang!

13:11.875 --> 13:14.250
-JEFF: No way!
-Get outta here!

13:14.333 --> 13:15.416
Callie Lang?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.000
I thought she was dead!

13:17.083 --> 13:18.625
-Stage four, man!
-LARRY: No, no.

13:18.708 --> 13:20.166
She survived her cancer.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.666
-She's o-- okay.
-SUSIE: Wow.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.666
She's living in Bend, Oregon.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.291
-Really?
-Bend, Oregon?

13:25.375 --> 13:27.166
I got to tell you,
some of the best advice

13:27.250 --> 13:29.500
I ever got in my life
was from Callie Lang.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.875
When I was starting
the business,

13:30.958 --> 13:33.375
you may forget this, but I was
deciding, "Do I go chairs

13:33.458 --> 13:34.625
or do I go mattresses?"

13:34.708 --> 13:37.791
And she said, "Freddy,
not everybody wants to sit..."

13:37.875 --> 13:39.750
-"...But everybody's
got to sleep."
-FREDDY: That's right!

13:39.833 --> 13:41.083
-Ha!
-And I never looked back!

13:41.166 --> 13:44.250
I think I listened to it
because she was stage four.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.750
-(ALL AGREEING)
-It had, like, an impact to it.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.541
I know. I had the same
sort of experience with her

13:48.625 --> 13:51.791
because she was stage four,
we were having a long talk,

13:51.875 --> 13:53.416
and she gave me
some very good advice

13:53.500 --> 13:56.166
and she said,
"Don't ever sign a prenup."

13:56.250 --> 13:57.833
-ALL: Whoa!
-CHERYL: And I didn't!

13:57.916 --> 13:59.291
And it was very good advice.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.666
That worked out very well
for you, Cheryl.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.125
CHERYL: It did.
It was very good advice.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.625
-She was smart about that.
-HARRY: She was a sage.

14:03.708 --> 14:06.416
She gave me some advice when
she was stage four, and she--

14:06.500 --> 14:08.958
She's the one who told you
not to sign a prenup?

14:09.041 --> 14:12.000
Yes, she had some
sort of perspective

14:12.083 --> 14:14.416
-that other people don't have.
-FREDDY: It's good advice.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.583
SUSIE: You know what she did
for us, Jeff, do you remember?

14:16.666 --> 14:18.583
We were going through that
really rough patch

14:18.666 --> 14:20.125
-and we were gonna split.
-JEFF: Mm.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.041
And she said,
"Work it out, you guys

14:22.125 --> 14:23.666
-are meant for each other."
-ALL: Aww.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.458
"You're gonna have a long,
wonderful life and a marriage.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.625
Cheers to that.
This is a great conversation.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.583
-Cheers to that.
-ANDY: Bravo. Bravo.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.916
-HARRY: To you and to you guys.
-ANDY: I'm happy for you.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.291
Let me ask you this question,
what about stage three advice?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.458
-What do you do?
-And death is not looming?

14:37.541 --> 14:39.666
-What percentage?
-Twenty percent.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.333
LARRY: Twenty percent,
you listen twenty percent.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.125
-What about you?
-Sixty-forty.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.541
Sixty-forty. Freddy?

14:44.625 --> 14:47.166
That's a true coin flip for me.
I could go either way with that.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.166
LARRY: Harry?

14:48.250 --> 14:50.416
Well, I listen,
but grain of salt.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.458
-LARRY: Grain of salt.
-You couldn't pay me

14:52.541 --> 14:54.958
to listen to advice
from a stage three.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.083
-Stage four only!
-SUSIE: Wow!

14:57.166 --> 14:59.208
Stage three doesn't get his ear!
I don't believe that.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.625
-(ALL CLAMORING)
-(SCOFFS) Stage four!

15:01.708 --> 15:03.416
(OVERLAPPING CLAMOR)

15:03.500 --> 15:04.541
You're good.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.791
You're very good.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.791
What is this?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.000
Remember that woman
that I was texting with?

15:20.083 --> 15:21.166
You said I should tell her

15:21.250 --> 15:23.000
that I'm doing
a hot dog eating contest?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.958
Yeah. What-- what happened?

15:25.041 --> 15:27.625
-She believed me.
-Oh, my God. You're kidding?

15:27.708 --> 15:29.958
-No, I'm not.
-How could she believe that?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.500
It's a joke. It's a joke.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.041
But you know
what happened was,

15:33.125 --> 15:36.000
you gave me a lie
so fucking crazy

15:36.083 --> 15:38.541
that she's like,
"Why would he lie about this?

15:38.625 --> 15:39.916
This has to be true."

15:40.000 --> 15:41.625
-Huh!
-Who's the guy that said, uh,

15:41.708 --> 15:44.625
the bigger the lie,
the more they believe it?

15:44.708 --> 15:46.458
-Oh, Goebbels.
-Goebbels.

15:46.541 --> 15:48.875
Yeah, you gave me
a Goebbels-level lie.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.291
-Seriously?
-Yeah. Well, I don't-- Yeah!

15:51.375 --> 15:54.500
Are you saying I achieved
Goebbels lying status?

15:54.583 --> 15:57.083
-Yeah, yeah, you're--
-Because Goebbels is the GOAT.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.541
And you know what happens when
you use a lie from the GOAT?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.750
Not only did she believe it,
but she's impressed.

16:02.833 --> 16:04.125
She's, like,
obsessed with it now.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.166
She texts me all day,
"When did you get into hot dogs?

16:07.250 --> 16:10.208
-Do you like pork or beef or--"
-Wow.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.250
I'm so paranoid she's gonna
come over to my place.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.666
I had to go to Eagle Rock
to a little trophy store

16:14.750 --> 16:17.875
and have a trophy made up
for a hot dog eating contest

16:17.958 --> 16:20.208
that I won in 1998
that I was never in.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.166
What are you gonna do about
the hot dog eating contest?

16:22.250 --> 16:25.000
-You're gonna be in the contest?
-Fuck no! I'm gonna--

16:25.083 --> 16:27.208
I'm gonna keep this going
as long as I can.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.791
Hopefully, we can hook up,

16:28.875 --> 16:31.750
and then I can have my doctor
text me or call me and say,

16:31.833 --> 16:33.500
"Oh, you know what,
because of your health,

16:33.583 --> 16:35.791
I'm gonna have to recommend
that you drop out,"

16:35.875 --> 16:38.291
I got to have-- Fuck!
I got to make up a doctor now!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.500
-By the way.
-What?

16:39.583 --> 16:42.708
I wouldn't be so fast to drop
the hot dog eating.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.791
Clearly, this is... (CHUCKLES)

16:44.875 --> 16:47.291
This is the best thing
you've got going for you.

16:47.375 --> 16:51.083
Well, um, here's your taxes.
Enjoy your refund, Goebbels.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.916
Sorry, Harry.
I did the best I could.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.750
Yeah, well, you did too good!

16:57.791 --> 16:59.083
LARRY:<i> Hey, hey, hey!</i>

16:59.166 --> 17:00.250
Hey, hey, hey.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.875
(LAUGHS) My man.

17:01.958 --> 17:04.875
Hey, what's happening
in Mary Ferguson town?

17:04.958 --> 17:07.708
I'm having a hard time finding
a new Mary Ferguson.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.250
I'm surprised you found two.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.625
Let me show you my ad
for the brand-new one.

17:11.708 --> 17:12.958
Look at this shit.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.500
"Do you love adventure?

17:14.583 --> 17:16.708
Do you wanna travel to Asia
for free?

17:16.791 --> 17:18.250
Is your name Mary Ferguson?

17:18.333 --> 17:21.208
If the answer to all three
of these questions is yes,

17:21.291 --> 17:23.333
then contact Leon Black."

17:23.416 --> 17:25.625
Perfect. I'm thinking
about adding,

17:25.708 --> 17:27.250
"I ain't about that bullshit."

17:27.333 --> 17:29.666
(LAUGHS) Yeah, put it in,

17:29.750 --> 17:32.583
because that will be
a big sell. (LAUGHS)

17:32.666 --> 17:33.708
That'll sell 'em for sure!

17:33.791 --> 17:35.458
I'm posting this shit
everywhere.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.916
I'm putting this shit on, like,
you know how a motherfucker
lose their dog?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.625
I'm putting this shit on
fucking telephone poles

17:40.708 --> 17:42.458
-and trees and shit.
-Who's looking at trees?

17:42.541 --> 17:45.041
Nobody's walking down the street
looking at trees.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.333
The nicest people in the world

17:46.416 --> 17:50.000
are people who will return
a fucking dog to you.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.583
Who's not gonna return a dog?
What kind of asshole?

17:52.666 --> 17:54.875
I kept a dog for six years
one time, I found.

17:54.958 --> 17:57.291
What? Did it have a collar?
Was there a number to call?

17:57.375 --> 17:58.833
LEON: Fuck yeah,
it had all the goodies.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.083
So, why didn't you call?

18:00.166 --> 18:02.708
Because I fucking liked the dog.
I fucking liked the dog.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.125
You know how many times
I walked by

18:04.208 --> 18:06.875
the sign on the fucking tree
that said "lost dog,"

18:06.958 --> 18:09.166
and it was
this motherfucker right here?

18:09.250 --> 18:11.333
-That's cruel!
-I loved that motherfucking dog.

18:11.416 --> 18:13.125
By the way, Larry,
I've got an idea.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.875
It might be perfect
for your fucking minibar.

18:14.958 --> 18:15.958
Really?

18:16.041 --> 18:17.791
People go to hotels to fuck,
you understand?

18:17.875 --> 18:18.916
Yeah, I understand,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.291
but that's not necessarily true,
but go ahead.

18:21.375 --> 18:24.166
So, I take all the elements
of an ED pill

18:24.250 --> 18:27.583
and I infuse it into a beverage.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.166
I call it tap water.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.041
-Tap water.
-Based on tapping that ass.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.375
I understand what
it's based on, yeah.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.041
That's what people go
to hotels to do.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.333
It's like an energy drink
for your dick.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.291
I really think
you're onto something there.

18:38.375 --> 18:39.583
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Good idea. Right?

18:39.666 --> 18:41.875
-One of your best.
-Hey, man, you're missing out.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.666
People love to stay hydrated
and fuck.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.416
-There he is.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, geez.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.916
-ANDY: How are ya?
-What is this?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.250
We were just taking a walk
and strolling.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.541
-It's a beautiful day.
-Yup.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.041
I thought we'd stop by,
say hello.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.458
And if you wanna join us, come.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.250
-Meh.
-CASSIE: Come on!

18:59.333 --> 19:00.708
I don't really like
a purposeless walk,

19:00.791 --> 19:01.791
but thank you.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.500
What does that mean,
"A purposeless walk"?

19:03.583 --> 19:04.958
The walk is the purpose.

19:05.041 --> 19:07.000
The walk has to be
the secondary activity.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.416
-It can't be a primary activity.
-Mm.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.208
For example, you walk
on a golf course,

19:11.291 --> 19:12.458
it's a secondary activity.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.250
The primary activity
is the golf.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.458
-Okay.
-All right.

19:15.541 --> 19:16.625
She has something to ask you.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.500
Uh, we're having
a dinner party in two nights,

19:18.583 --> 19:21.625
and we would really like it
if you would middle, please.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.708
Please?

19:23.291 --> 19:24.375
When is it?

19:24.833 --> 19:25.875
Thursday night.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.708
Ah, I...

19:28.791 --> 19:30.208
-ANDY: Why? Come on.
-I can't.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.458
-Come on. Why not?
-Why?

19:33.666 --> 19:35.416
-Because I'm... (CHUCKLES)
-What?

19:35.500 --> 19:38.208
I'm in a hot dog eating contest
the next day.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.458
-Oh, Larry, shut up.
-What?

19:39.541 --> 19:40.875
-LARRY: True.
-No, you're not.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.416
Seriously, I'm in a hot dog
eating contest the next day

19:42.500 --> 19:43.791
and I can't eat that night.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.500
-Yeah.
-ANDY: Not at all?

19:46.583 --> 19:48.208
What if you just come
and you just don't eat?

19:48.291 --> 19:51.208
Ah, nah, you can't sit
at a table and not eat.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.166
-You feel crazy. Yeah.
-Hmm.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.208
-LARRY: Yeah.
-That's...

19:54.291 --> 19:56.500
Anyway, I got to go pick
somebody up,

19:56.583 --> 19:58.375
so I got to get going.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.625
ANDY: Okay.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.125

-CHERYL: Hi, guys.
-Hi.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.666
-CHERYL: Come in. Come in.
-Maria Sofia, this is Cheryl.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.375
-Hi, Maria Sofia.
-MARIA SOFIA: Hi.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.625
Really nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.000
(GASPS) Nice to meet you too!

20:13.083 --> 20:15.291
This house, beautiful.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.958
-Thank you.
-You got your bag
in the divorce.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.291
Okay.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.583
Um, this is my little
makeshift studio.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.541
-You can put your stuff down.
-Thank you.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.166
I'll be there in one second.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.958
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.250
-(DOOR CLOSES QUIETLY)
-LARRY: Yes!

20:35.333 --> 20:36.750
-CHERYL: Okay, Maria Sofia.
-(SIGHS)

20:36.833 --> 20:38.583
-I'm gonna record this.
-Okay.

20:38.666 --> 20:41.958
And pretend like
this is not even here.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.708
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay?

20:43.791 --> 20:46.458
Marsha, come out here.
I wanna talk to you.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.291
Marsha steps out
into the balcony,

20:48.375 --> 20:50.666
weaving through
the billowing laundry.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.333
Um, you-- That--
You don't need to read that.

20:53.416 --> 20:56.291
That is just, uh, action line.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.333
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sorry. That was weird.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.500
-Let's start from the beginning.
-Okay.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.000
Marsha, come out here,
I wanna talk to you.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.208
-(SCREAMING) I'm right here!
-CHERYL: Stop screaming!

21:04.291 --> 21:06.375
Screaming.
(SCREAMING) I wasn't screaming!

21:06.458 --> 21:09.000
Okay. Also,
if it's in parentheses,

21:09.083 --> 21:10.666
you shouldn't say it either.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.416
-Fine. I got it. I got it.
-CHERYL: Okay.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.000
I wanted to talk to you about
that David boy.

21:16.833 --> 21:17.958
Larry.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.416
CHERYL: Yeah.
That's his name, Larry David.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.708
Well, what about him?

21:22.791 --> 21:25.250
I feel like you're being
seductive right now.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.916
You're talking to your mother.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.333
Are we not close?

21:29.416 --> 21:31.458
In real life, do you ever talk
to your mother like that?

21:31.541 --> 21:35.416
No, I don't seduce my mom.
What is wrong with you? God!

21:35.500 --> 21:38.583
I'm talking to her
about my boyfriend, aren't I?

21:38.666 --> 21:42.375
Uh, I don't really care for him.
I think he's mentally disturbed.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.208
He is not mentally disturbed.

21:45.291 --> 21:46.708
And the worm.

21:46.791 --> 21:48.708
Uh, I--
I saw that choice that you made,

21:48.791 --> 21:50.875
and maybe it's time
to make a new choice.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.791
-Like, what kind of dance?
-No, not a--

21:52.875 --> 21:54.833
-No, I don't find--
You want a little bit of salsa?

21:54.916 --> 21:57.208
Let's just keep going.
Let's just keep...

21:57.291 --> 22:00.500
You want bald children
with no brains, go right ahead.

22:00.583 --> 22:05.375
I don't have to listen to you.
If I wanna see Larry,

22:05.458 --> 22:10.541
oh, I will see...

22:10.625 --> 22:11.750
Larry. (COUGHS)

22:14.541 --> 22:16.291
-Let's just take five.
-(CAMERA BEEPS)

22:16.375 --> 22:20.041
You'd be surprised what
motherfuckers like
in their-- in their minibar.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.583
-LARRY: Black licorice?
-Perfect.

22:21.666 --> 22:25.416
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. We got our first item.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.208
-JEFF: Olives!
-Black or green or both?

22:28.291 --> 22:29.583
Maybe both.

22:29.666 --> 22:32.416
LEON: Fucking mushroom jerky.
They jerked a fucking mushroom.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.125
Oh, figs!

22:34.208 --> 22:35.958
I can't even believe
how good this is.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.041
This is...
Already, we're packed.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.500
JEFF: Oh, fudge!

22:39.583 --> 22:41.291
Wasabi-flavored peas.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.125
Huh? This is the best minibar
of all time.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.250
Yeah.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.375
Hello?

22:50.458 --> 22:54.416
Hey. Yeah, I left my jacket
at your ex-wife's house.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.875
Uh, can you call her and just
see if she can look for it?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.791
Um... All right. Hold on.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.208
-MARIA SOFIA:<i> Okay. Thank you.</i>

-Hey.
-LARRY:<i> Hey, it's me.</i>

23:03.500 --> 23:06.125
<i>So, um, Maria Sofia called me.</i>

23:06.208 --> 23:08.333
She thinks she left her jacket
at your house.

23:08.416 --> 23:10.125
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's not here.

23:10.208 --> 23:11.916
I haven't seen any jacket.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.750
-LARRY:<i> Okay. All right. Thanks.</i>
-Okay.

23:13.833 --> 23:14.833
Okay, bye.

23:14.916 --> 23:17.416
-LARRY:<i> It's not there.</i>
-No, it's there.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.250
She liked the flowers and shit,
so I don't know,

23:19.333 --> 23:22.916
maybe she, you know, she doesn't
wanna actually look for it.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.250
What are you suggesting,
that she's keeping your jacket?

23:26.333 --> 23:27.541
Well, she said she liked it.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.291
Now she's saying
that she can't find it.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.041
-So what am I supposed to think?
-Oh, my God.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.416
Are you out of your mind?

23:33.500 --> 23:36.791
You know what? It's my jacket,
and I'm gonna find it.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.458
All right. Okay.

23:43.708 --> 23:45.916
You know,
I hate to sound immodest,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.500
but I don't think you're gonna
find a better minibar display,

23:49.583 --> 23:51.625
not just in the country,
in the world.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.666
This is just amazing stuff here.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.750
(RATTLING)

23:55.833 --> 23:58.791
Do we love the sound of that,
wasabi peas?

23:58.875 --> 24:00.208
People love wasabi peas.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.833
They're gonna slide out
that drawer.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.208
-They're gonna freak out.
-Hmm.

24:03.291 --> 24:06.500
(EXCLAIMS) "They got peas,
wasabi peas!"

24:06.583 --> 24:09.750
What else do we got here?
Oh, my God. What is this?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.958
It's a parmesan crisp.

24:14.041 --> 24:16.416
This is one of the world's
great crackers.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.916
-There's parmesan in this!
-FREDDY: Mm-hmm.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.791
-Parmesan! You like Parmesan?
-Mm...

24:20.875 --> 24:22.750
Freddy, I've seen you
at an Italian restaurant!

24:22.833 --> 24:25.375
-I like parmesan.
-LARRY: Going like this
with the parmesan cheese!

24:25.458 --> 24:27.208
Come on. This, you're not
gonna find anywhere.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.708
-That's true, not in a minibar.
-Mm-hmm, no.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.125
LARRY: You're not gonna find
a parmesan crisp there.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.791
No, you're not gonna
find that in a minibar.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.291
Yeah, okay. Come on.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.291
Figs? You ever seen that
at a minibar?

24:35.375 --> 24:37.958
No. Of course not. Why?
Nobody's thought of it!

24:38.041 --> 24:40.458
I have! I have!

24:40.541 --> 24:41.708
Do you like figs? You like 'em?

24:41.791 --> 24:43.458
I'm not a-- I wouldn't
say I'm a fig guy.

24:43.541 --> 24:45.750
-You like figs?
-Mm, I'm not a big fig fan.

24:45.833 --> 24:47.625
I'm giving you gold here.

24:47.708 --> 24:50.625
Figs! All right.
The coup de grâce.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.583
Peppermint Pattie.

24:54.666 --> 24:55.750
-Classic.
-It's classic.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.291
It's a classic.
You like a Peppermint Pattie?

24:58.375 --> 24:59.583
I can't say I'm a big fan.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.750
I don't really like
Peppermint Patties, actually.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.916
What do you eat?
What is your story?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.250
You don't seem to like anything.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.625
It doesn't matter what I like,

25:06.708 --> 25:08.375
it matters
what our customers like.

25:08.458 --> 25:10.916
All right. So here's
the headline here. Okay?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.916
We're liking this,
but not loving it.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.375
What do you mean? Who?

25:16.458 --> 25:18.375
Well, we had a focus group
in La Cañada,

25:18.458 --> 25:20.250
and we let them enjoy
the experience.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.625
And we got numbers
on all of this stuff,

25:21.708 --> 25:23.500
-which could be helpful.
-Oh, you had a focus group, huh?

25:23.583 --> 25:26.708
So if I talk to you about
men over 25 on, say, the figs.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.083
Uh, about 15 percent.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.958
Only about 15 percent
of the men are liking it.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.708
Now, if you deal with
educated men,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.250
men that have
four years of college?

25:33.333 --> 25:35.208
Um, it's a little higher,
at 20 percent.

25:35.291 --> 25:36.708
But if you go
to the uneducated men,

25:36.791 --> 25:38.083
you know, high school or less?

25:38.166 --> 25:39.583
ASSISTANT: Then it's lower,
about eight percent.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.916
Right. What we wanna try to do
is we want everyone

25:42.000 --> 25:44.625
-at least in the 70s, 80s.
-ASSISTANT: Mm-hmm, exactly.

25:44.708 --> 25:48.166
So the bottom line here is
we need a four-quadrant minibar.

25:48.250 --> 25:51.916
So would you possibly
be open to working

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
and collaborating with
a co-curator?

25:54.083 --> 25:55.833
Forget it, Freddy.
It's not gonna happen.

25:55.916 --> 25:58.250
There's no co-curator.
I'm the curator.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.791
This is my minibar.
These are my ideas.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.625
And if you don't like it, I go.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.083
I wish you could've been there
in La Cañada. 'Cause again...

26:05.166 --> 26:07.041
-Okay.
-...liking, just not loving
the ideas.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.125
LARRY: I think we're done.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.458
Did you wanna take home
the numbers?

26:09.541 --> 26:11.916
LARRY: No, I really don't.
I'm really not interested.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.250
-I'm sorry you feel that way.
-LARRY: Big mistake.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.375
And you know what else?

26:15.458 --> 26:17.375
I don't want you using
any of my ideas.

26:17.458 --> 26:18.750
I'll fucking sue you.

26:18.833 --> 26:20.500
If you wanna suit up
over the minibar ideas,
you can suit up.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.875
You're just gonna be
throwing your money away.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.583
What, are you gonna sue me
for the Peppermint Pattie?

26:23.666 --> 26:26.083
-If you don't have the vision...
-FREDDY: I don't.

26:26.166 --> 26:29.333
...to know how amazing
a wasabi pea

26:29.416 --> 26:30.750
would be in a minibar,

26:30.833 --> 26:32.416
I don't really want anything
to do with you.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.541
Thank you for your time.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.208
-Okay. All right.
-That's right. Thank you.

26:35.291 --> 26:36.708
All right, let's go
with the other guy.

26:36.791 --> 26:37.916
-Yeah.
-Okay.

26:40.583 --> 26:41.583
-CHERYL: Hi.
-LARRY: Hey.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.166
-Hi.
-Hi, Maria Sofia. Come on in.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.458
-How are you?
-I'm good.

26:45.541 --> 26:46.666
-How are you?
-Good.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.791
So, listen, I've been doing
a lot of studying,

26:48.875 --> 26:51.541
reading up on the Jews.
They use their hands a lot.

26:51.625 --> 26:54.166
So I think I would do,
you know, some, like...

26:55.041 --> 26:56.791
Ah! Something like this.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.791
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

26:59.791 --> 27:01.125
Okay. Why don't you go ahead

27:01.208 --> 27:03.333
and get comfortable
in the studio,

27:03.416 --> 27:05.250
and I will be there
in just a minute.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.083
Good idea.

27:07.166 --> 27:09.458
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-(LARRY SIGHS)

27:11.666 --> 27:18.625
Um, she is the worst actress
I have ever seen in my life.

27:18.708 --> 27:20.083
An eating disorder?

27:20.166 --> 27:22.833
I mean, she reads
her character's name

27:22.916 --> 27:25.958
before she reads the line.
She reads the stage directions.

27:26.041 --> 27:28.750
Larry and Marsha
sit at the table eating!

27:28.833 --> 27:32.041
She also does weird things
with her body physically.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.500
I mean, she's gyrating.

27:33.583 --> 27:36.291
She's practicing her lines
and she's gyrating.

27:36.375 --> 27:37.458
Look at her. Look.

27:37.541 --> 27:40.708
Eat them latkes! (MOANS)

27:40.791 --> 27:42.500
She's so awful.

27:42.583 --> 27:45.125
Just get the best tape you can
and send it to casting.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.666
-Okay? Please?
-Okay. Okay.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.208
She was wearing
the yellow dress!

27:49.291 --> 27:53.541
Larry, she's gonna kill
your show like a cancer.

27:55.958 --> 27:57.250
(QUIETLY) Like a cancer?

28:54.541 --> 28:56.625
You mind if I ask him
some questions?

28:56.708 --> 28:58.041
Yeah, you should.

28:59.291 --> 29:00.625
MARCOS: Hey, uh, Jeff?

29:00.708 --> 29:02.583
-Yeah.
-I'm Marcos.

29:02.666 --> 29:05.208
Um, I was wondering
if I can ask you a question.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.291
-Now is the time.
-Yeah.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.125
This place is doing okay,
it's just,

29:09.208 --> 29:11.250
I was wondering
if you had any advice on,

29:11.333 --> 29:13.958
you know, taking it
to the next level.

29:14.041 --> 29:16.791
-Do you serve breakfast?
-We don't, no.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.958
That would be
an addition you need.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.541
People love breakfast burritos.

29:21.625 --> 29:24.041
You never have anyone
turn down a breakfast burrito.

29:24.125 --> 29:25.458
Oh, my God. So true.

29:25.541 --> 29:27.250
You want my own
personal favorite?

29:27.333 --> 29:30.958
-Please?
-Waffle and a breakfast burrito.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.625
You wrap the waffle?

29:32.708 --> 29:34.833
You wrap the waffle
amongst itself.

29:34.916 --> 29:37.875
And, uh, rice pudding.

29:37.958 --> 29:41.458
And also, you're gonna have
to do a lot of social media.

29:41.541 --> 29:43.958
-I'm not good at it, you know.
-JEFF: You're not good at it.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.541
If you don't like it,
maybe you have

29:45.625 --> 29:48.333
a son or a daughter
who enjoys social media.

29:48.416 --> 29:50.708
I do have a daughter,
but she doesn't have time

29:50.791 --> 29:52.791
for that stuff.
She's gonna be an actress.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.500
You know, I've been in
showbusiness a long time.

29:55.583 --> 29:59.541
And I'm gonna tell you something
that I tell every parent.

29:59.625 --> 30:00.666
Don't do it.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.958
Don't allow your child
to be an actress.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.791
-Really?
-I've met many

30:05.875 --> 30:07.625
-a good young actress...
-MARCOS: Yeah.

30:07.708 --> 30:11.208
...whose life has been ruined
by the business.

30:11.291 --> 30:12.791
That's what I feel.

30:14.541 --> 30:16.416
-Thank you.
-Sure.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.208
Man, I thought she was
gonna be a star, but, uh...

30:20.750 --> 30:22.000
I guess I was wrong.

30:23.166 --> 30:24.416
What are you gonna do?

30:25.250 --> 30:26.875
Now, how about that taco?

30:26.958 --> 30:28.583
I'll get you guys a taco.

30:28.666 --> 30:29.958
-Thank you.
-MARCOS: Okay. Yeah.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.666

30:32.750 --> 30:34.666
MARCOS: What can I get you guys?

30:34.750 --> 30:37.125
Okay. So, what's really
important about this

30:37.208 --> 30:39.208
is the emotion behind it.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.708
Think about something
that makes you mad

30:40.791 --> 30:43.916
while you're reading this scene,
okay? Can you do that?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.625
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah, you've got
a good attitude.

30:45.708 --> 30:48.083
