00:23.231 --> 00:26.985
[man] Sector 5 harvesting will
conclude in ten minutes.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.071
- You heard him.
Ten minutes.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.449
[man] Deposit all crops
before curfew.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.868
[boss] Hurry up!
No slacking!

00:34.909 --> 00:36.703
Get back to work!

00:36.745 --> 00:38.455
- Daniel, you dead idiot.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.582
I told you to stay out of
the deep end.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.503
Dude, where you been?

00:45.545 --> 00:48.214
- I got us a contract.
- Fuck off!

00:48.256 --> 00:49.466
- We're both about
to fuck off.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.717
Four years, and then we get

00:50.759 --> 00:54.137
two acres of pristine
beachfront O.C. property

00:54.179 --> 00:55.513
as our reward.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.640
- "The female has been
assigned to domestic work.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.184
"The male, food service."

00:59.225 --> 01:00.894
We got to do four years
of this shit?

01:00.935 --> 01:03.229
- We've been stuck in these
fields since we were kids.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.483
Did you not hear what I said
about beachfront property?

01:06.524 --> 01:08.735
Once we're done, it's blue skies
and yellow sands

01:08.777 --> 01:11.154
for the rest of our lives.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.614
- What about Adrian?

01:12.655 --> 01:15.033
- Come on, Adrian?
It doesn't mean anything.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.992
We're just having
a little fun.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.119
- I know.
We share a wall.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.413
[Tobin] Do you two assholes
ever shut up?

01:20.455 --> 01:21.623
Don't have me report you.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.999
- Mind your fucking
business, Tobin!

01:23.041 --> 01:24.292
- Don't make me shove this
up your urethra, Tobin.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.836
- No one even likes you!
Why are you even talking?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.129
- Come on, man.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.465
We're packing our bags,
and we're getting out.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.425
- Do I get a say in this
at all or what, huh?

01:32.467 --> 01:33.718
- What are you gonna say,
fuckhead?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.303
That you're not interested
in a better life?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.846
That you don't
want to be happy?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.431
You seriously wanna spend
the rest of your days

01:38.473 --> 01:41.142
becoming shriveled up and
useless like Tobin?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.644
- I heard that.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.521
- We wanted you to hear it!
- She wanted you to hear it.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.024
Okay, let's do it.

01:48.066 --> 01:48.942
But you're finishing
off our work

01:48.983 --> 01:50.443
for the rest of the day.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.281
- Done. Pick em up, fuckhead.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.787
[distant laughter]

02:00.829 --> 02:03.164
- Fuck. My head.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.668
[John Doe] Quiet?

02:06.710 --> 02:07.919
[groaning]

02:07.961 --> 02:08.962
- Why are we here?

02:09.004 --> 02:11.715
- We're okay.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.049
- Are you sure?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.884
- Yeah.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.720
He left a note.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.185
"The astral nauts
of store LIS004

02:33.319 --> 02:35.697
"Please do not move me."

02:35.739 --> 02:39.159
See? They ascended.
We're good.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.911
Fine. I'll take out
the leftovers.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.747
Come on, Zach.

02:46.249 --> 02:51.171
Oh, these bones feel
like spaghetti.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.714
You're lucky I got you
out of Topeka.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.133
Stone almost
smoked your ass, right?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.343
Ow! What's that for?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.219
- I had him!
That was my kill.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.639
- Who, Stone?
Are you delusional?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.183
When I saw you,
your car was sideways

03:03.224 --> 03:04.684
and you were
covered with blood.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.561
Matter of fact,
you're still bleeding.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.274
- At least
he's dead, right?

03:11.316 --> 03:14.152
- Stone? Yeah.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.028
Maybe.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.404
Now that I think of it, no.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.531
- What the fuck, John?
- I was busy trying

03:18.573 --> 03:20.533
to get your ass out of
that amusement park alive.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.618
The fact that we're
both standing here,

03:21.659 --> 03:23.161
I think I made
the right call.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.371
- That wasn't
your call to make.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.206
- Says the asshole
who poisoned me.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.041
- And I told you
not to come back for me.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.334
- Well, I ignored that.
- Why?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.627
- Because it was a stupid
fucking thing to say.

03:30.669 --> 03:31.711
- Well, you're
fucking stupid.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.631
- Well, so are you.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.965
* Yeah *

03:37.592 --> 03:38.718
* Yeah *

03:41.805 --> 03:44.265
- Do you think something's
about to happen?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.642
Because it definitely is.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.480
- It's been a while since I--
- Why do you talk so much?

Excuse me, everyone.

Yes, another one.

back to him?

Bye.

he'll give you a bullet enema,

one first.

ten miles of Officer Psychopath

you pulled.

Oh, my God.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.318
[thunder crashes]

13:44.824 --> 13:46.910
[thunder crashes]

14:11.351 --> 14:13.645
- Oh, lucky shot.
- Really?

14:13.687 --> 14:14.604
You wanna make it
interesting?

14:14.646 --> 14:16.648
- Okay.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.609
I sink it, I get to ask
you whatever I want.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.861
You sink it,
same deal.

14:21.903 --> 14:25.365
- Fine.
You go first.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.409
You fucker.
[chuckles]

14:27.450 --> 14:29.244
You played me.
- Me? No!

14:29.285 --> 14:32.831
That was just luck.
But since you lost,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.958
what's the coolest place
you've ever been?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.835
- Are you seriously not
gonna ask me my first name?

14:36.876 --> 14:40.547
- Oh, shit. Wait, no.
- Nope!

14:40.588 --> 14:43.633
Disneyland.
- What's that?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.510
- You never heard of
Disneyland?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.678
I went there
when I was a kid.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.221
Before the fall.
Lots of kids did.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.474
It had a castle, rides,
princesses, Mickey Mouse.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.600
- Why did this mouse
have a name?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.519
Why was he so special?
- Excuse me.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.646
Mickey was very cool.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.689
He had a snappy little tux,

14:57.731 --> 14:59.149
and he gave very
good hugs, too.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.110
- You hugged a giant mouse?
That's disgusting.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.529
I would never take a child
to this land of monsters.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.907
- It was the happiest place
on earth, motherfucker.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.284
Let me guess, the coolest
place you've ever been

15:09.325 --> 15:10.118
is up your own ass.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.911
- Ah, ah, ah, play the game.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.836
The Container Store.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.047
- The Container Store?
- Yes.

15:22.088 --> 15:26.551
Picture a store full of
plastic containers, dispensers,

15:26.593 --> 15:28.970
big, small,
all different colors.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.389
When I get my own spot
in New San Francisco,

15:31.431 --> 15:34.934
everything is gonna have
its own place to go.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.561
- Do you own anything
of value?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.480
- Ah-- You already asked
your question.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.232
Now it's my turn.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.692
[laughs]

15:42.734 --> 15:44.152
- What do you mean you've never
stepped in the ocean?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.987
- Never have and never will.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.782
- What? Why?
- Ghosts.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.283
The ghosts in the ocean?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.660
- There aren't any fucking
ghosts in the ocean!

15:52.702 --> 15:53.870
- Have you ever been
to the ocean?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.122
It's dark, man.
Look, the shadows

15:56.164 --> 15:59.000
are the perfect
breeding ground for spirits.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.377
And, have you ever heard of
ghost ships?

16:00.418 --> 16:03.171
Who the fuck do you think
are piloting those ships?

16:03.213 --> 16:07.342
Dolphins?
- You fucking dunce.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.261
- You don't have to laugh, man.
- Yes, I do.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.055
That is the dumbest shit
I've ever heard.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.682
Next, you're gonna tell me
you believe in

16:13.723 --> 16:16.935
life on other planets.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.229
Oh, fuck off!
- Not aliens like this.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.772
But come on,
you mean to tell me

16:20.814 --> 16:23.066
that you think we're the only
ones in the whole universe?

16:23.108 --> 16:26.027
Just us? It's a sad way of
thinking, if you ask me.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.362
- You'd rather
believe in aliens?

16:27.404 --> 16:29.781
- I rather believe
we're not in it alone.

16:29.823 --> 16:30.824
- Oh, well, we're not alone,

16:30.865 --> 16:33.284
because, you know,
ocean ghosts.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.786
- Have you ever been to
the bottom of the ocean,

16:34.828 --> 16:36.079
or space?
- Not lately.

16:36.121 --> 16:40.125
- So you don't know
what's out there, do you?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.252
- I'll give you that.
- Thank you.

16:42.293 --> 16:45.380
- I never saw a Watkyn's storm
before today, obviously.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.298
- But I've never seen
a llama and a goat

16:47.340 --> 16:49.134
in the same room
at the same time.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.719
And if we're being honest...

16:50.760 --> 16:54.889
[both] I think they're
the same animal.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.891
- I've never broken my arm.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.144
- I've never
ridden a bicycle.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.895
- I've never seen snow.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.357
- I've never seen
a baby pigeon.

17:04.399 --> 17:08.028
- I've never fucked
in a ball pit... twice.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.532
[thunder crashes]

17:12.574 --> 17:13.992
- Neither have I.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.746
* Burgers and fries
and chips and pies *

17:17.787 --> 17:20.165
* It was simple and good
back then *

17:20.206 --> 17:23.001
[moaning, grunting]

17:23.043 --> 17:24.836
- Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
The other way.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.338
Left, left.

17:26.379 --> 17:31.009
[screaming]

17:31.051 --> 17:32.886
Oh my God! Oh, my God.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.929
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.931
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.769
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.103
[laughing]

17:42.145 --> 17:43.438
You know what it was?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.523
It was that motherfucker's
teeth, you know?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.276
Like they would have been okay
on somebody else's face,

17:48.318 --> 17:50.070
a bigger face.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.446
Anyway, Adrian was
the last person

17:51.488 --> 17:55.075
that I had sex with,
and it just wasn't very good.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.035
- What, the teeth
got in the way?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.620
- Think about it.
- Oh!

17:58.661 --> 18:02.540
- Yes, they did.
[laughing]

18:02.582 --> 18:04.542
[thunder crashes]

18:04.584 --> 18:06.628
Hey, you were right.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.130
I should have thanked you.
- Thank me for what?

18:09.172 --> 18:11.758
Saving your ass
or crushing that ass?

18:11.800 --> 18:12.926
- Gross!

18:12.967 --> 18:16.638
[laughing]

18:16.680 --> 18:19.057
- Look, I was thinking, um--

18:23.561 --> 18:24.896
- Oh, I'm sorry,

18:24.938 --> 18:28.733
is John Doe the motor mouth
actually tongue tied?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.902
Oh, my goodness.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.821
Come on, man,
spit it out!

18:32.862 --> 18:35.323
You're giving me blue balls.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.201
- You should
come with me.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.413
- What?
- Do this delivery with me.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.748
Look, the only reason
we've made it this far

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
is because
we've had each other.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.295
- I can't.
- No, we could be partners.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.547
- Partners?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.090
What would I get out of
being your partner?

18:52.132 --> 18:56.553
- What would you get?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.096
You'd get this.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.724
This delivery gets me
into New San Francisco.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.100
It could get you in, too.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.977
You can have a better life
on the inside.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.564
Security, safety.
- No.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.442
I've been on the inside.
I know what it's like.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.194
- No, no, no. New San Francisco
is different than the O.C.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.195
- You don't know that.
- I do.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.655
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.199
- You really think
you know everything, don't you?

19:18.241 --> 19:20.535
- Well, in this case, I do.
[sighing]

19:20.577 --> 19:23.204
- I can't come with you.

19:24.873 --> 19:25.915
- Okay. Okay,
okay, okay,

19:25.957 --> 19:27.542
look, even if
you go back to Stone,

19:27.584 --> 19:29.461
and even if you succeed
in killing him,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.963
which you won't, by the way--
- Fuck you, I won't.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.673
- There'll always
be another Stone,

19:33.715 --> 19:36.217
and another and another.
Trust me, it's not worth it.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.720
- You don't understand.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.014
- Look, I spent decades dealing
with guys just like Stone.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.266
You think he's the only
crazy asshole out here?

19:43.308 --> 19:45.060
I don't want
that life anymore.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.645
That's why I'm doing this,
to find a better one.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.481
- There's nothing better!

19:49.522 --> 19:50.857
I tried to find
something better,

19:50.899 --> 19:52.942
and I got my brother killed.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.694
- Look, you're
carrying too much,

19:54.736 --> 19:56.613
the jacket, your guilt.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.074
You can't carry around
t-the burden of your brother

19:59.115 --> 20:00.492
for the rest
of your life!

20:00.533 --> 20:01.743
- Well, that's easy
for you to say.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.579
You never had a brother.
You never had anyone.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.837
- Well, at least
I'm not a stubborn asshole

20:12.879 --> 20:15.382
with a death wish because
she's feeling sorry for herself.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.258
- I don't feel
sorry for myself.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.386
- Well, you could've fooled me.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.681
- You know what?
I don't fuckin' need this.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.433
As soon as that storm's over,
I'm gone.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.395
- Fine, you're slowing me
down anyway!

20:30.730 --> 20:33.233
What are you looking at?

20:40.073 --> 20:41.408
- No, no, no.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.994
- So I'm sick of looking
at your shitty face!

20:45.036 --> 20:47.622
[grunting]

20:47.664 --> 20:51.501
But first,
for my collection.

without you...

fuckhead.

21:36.338 --> 21:40.216
- Thanks, little bunny.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.469
- I wanted a better
life for us,

21:42.510 --> 21:45.347
and this isn't it.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.766

Go to sleep!

I can help.

- I don't need your help.
Fuck.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.964
- You don't have to
carry that alone.

24:25.006 --> 24:27.133
- Watch me.
