00:55.667 --> 00:57.233
Sophia.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.834
I wish Mr. Fixit would finish
working on that dishwasher.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.467
The dishes are piling up.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.667
Blanche, we could wash them.

01:04.734 --> 01:07.100
Before dishwashers,
people didn't eat

01:07.166 --> 01:09.300
and wipe the dishes
on their pants.

01:10.533 --> 01:13.100
I used to love washing dishes.

01:13.166 --> 01:17.500
In Minnesota, the whole family would
get together and wash dishes.

01:19.066 --> 01:22.834
Even uncle Gustav,
after the swiss army knife accident,

01:22.900 --> 01:24.700
learned to dry dishes
with his feet.

01:27.367 --> 01:30.967
We used to carry on
and have a happy time.

01:31.033 --> 01:34.400
All you people ever had were
happy times?

01:34.467 --> 01:35.834
It's sickening.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.600
Happy times freezing in the cold,

01:37.667 --> 01:39.367
happy times
during the locust invasion,

01:39.433 --> 01:40.934
happy times eating reindeer.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.900
How about death,
was that happy?

01:45.867 --> 01:50.633
Yes. We got together
and remembered other happy times.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.266
She's getting to me.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.633
In Sicily,
we washed dishes in the river.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.867
(doorbell rings)

01:57.934 --> 01:59.633
I hope that's Mr. Fixit.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.367
We used to beat them
against the rocks.

02:01.433 --> 02:06.667
No, you beat the clothes on
the rocks, not the dishes.

02:06.734 --> 02:08.000
No wonder they broke.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.400
Ok, who wants
to go shopping?

02:11.467 --> 02:13.467
Isn't it early for that?

02:13.533 --> 02:14.800
Then we'll go eat.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.700
It's either shopping or eating.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.066
You didn't talk to him.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.667
I couldn't.

02:19.734 --> 02:21.867
George was on call all weekend.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.867
Three heart attacks, two aneurysms,
and a spastic colon.

02:25.934 --> 02:28.533
Sounds like a guy
I play checkers with.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.867
-Hi, Renee.
-Oh, hi, Rose.

02:30.934 --> 02:32.467
Then you'll talk tonight?

02:32.533 --> 02:34.500
-I'll try.
-Oh, Renee.

02:34.567 --> 02:37.266
It's crazy,
but how can I bother him?

02:37.333 --> 02:40.800
He's doing important stuff,
saving lives.

02:40.867 --> 02:43.200
I'll bother him
because I'm unhappy?

02:43.700 --> 02:47.867
Renee, Jenny just left for college.
All your kids are gone.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.500
This is a perfectly
legitimate problem.

02:50.567 --> 02:52.467
It's the empty nest syndrome.

02:52.533 --> 02:56.667
When I had it, I didn't know
what it was. I was just very depressed.

02:56.734 --> 03:02.567
By the time I figured it out, I was
going to tell Charlie, but he died.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.367
I was so full of grief
about Charlie,

03:04.433 --> 03:07.100
I forgot my empty nest depression.

03:10.967 --> 03:15.700
I couldn't wait
for my kids to get out.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.133
I got depressed
watching them grow older

03:18.200 --> 03:20.600
because it meant
I was getting older.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.033
They were like
noisy little calendars.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.367
When they entered high school,

03:26.433 --> 03:28.100
I told everybody
they were my husband's

03:28.166 --> 03:29.667
from a previous marriage.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.300
And you wonder
why they're in therapy.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.967
Maybe I should go into therapy.

03:37.033 --> 03:41.600
At 2, waiting up for George,
I called a radio talk show.

03:41.667 --> 03:44.266
I gave the solution
to the mid-east crisis.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.200
Giving the Palestinians Greenland?

03:47.266 --> 03:48.467
You heard it?

03:49.934 --> 03:52.734
I didn't know that was you.
You were great.

03:58.066 --> 04:01.367
Giving the Palestinians Greenland?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.667
It's a big place.
Nobody uses it.

04:05.533 --> 04:09.367
You'd take desert people
and put them in the snow?

04:09.433 --> 04:12.000
With proper clothes,
they'll be fine.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.767
You want to talk?

04:15.834 --> 04:17.533
Don't call talk shows.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.667
Talk to your husband.

04:18.734 --> 04:22.667
Blanche, at the hospital,
they call him saint George.

04:22.734 --> 04:26.200
I should tell a saint
to work less, I'm lonely?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.800
Don't you think saint Francis
of Assisi's wife

04:28.867 --> 04:30.300
had a similar problem?

04:30.367 --> 04:33.400
She said, "frank, enough donkeys."

04:36.333 --> 04:40.467
Do I ask George
to cut back his practice?

04:40.533 --> 04:44.000
No. I couldn't possibly
go to another doctor.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.767
See?

04:45.834 --> 04:48.367
George is the only man
to ever see me naked.

04:49.834 --> 04:50.967
Get out of here.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.934
Well, except for Charlie, of course.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.333
Get out of here.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.934
And the Vet.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.700
The vet?

05:08.834 --> 05:12.367
Our prize hen, Henrietta
had some chicken disease.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.633
I don't exactly know what it was.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.000
Chicken pox?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.700
No, I don't think so.

05:19.767 --> 05:24.266
Anyway, I had an earache,
so he saw us at the same time.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.133
For that, you got naked?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.467
I thought that was strange too.

05:35.266 --> 05:37.233
You know, Dorothy,
I think you're right.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.000
I've got to talk to George.

05:39.066 --> 05:39.934
Good girl!

05:40.000 --> 05:43.567
I'll go home and tell him.
I'll cook breakfast for him.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.734
Waffles, he loves waffles.
Well, I'll tell him at dinner.

05:47.800 --> 05:52.066
Dinner's better. He won't be
rushing. I'll make something great.

05:52.133 --> 05:55.533
-I'll tell him in bed.
-It always works.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.400
I'll tell him when he's asleep.

05:58.467 --> 06:01.533
-Renee, come on!
-I'll sound like a wimp.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.867
I can't tell him.

06:02.934 --> 06:06.033
If I can talk to him
about my stool sample,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.834
you can say you're lonely.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.367
Leonard, help me out here.
Where on your diet

06:23.433 --> 06:28.133
does it say creamed chipped beef
and polish sausage are ok to eat?

06:28.200 --> 06:31.500
Leonard, you're 5'6",
you weigh 300 pounds.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.700
What do you mean
you can carry it?

06:34.767 --> 06:36.300
Bekins couldn't carry it.

06:38.133 --> 06:41.633
Ok, come by the office tomorrow.
We'll talk about it.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.633
-(knock on door)
-Goodbye, Leonard.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.467
-Hi, Chuck.
-I'm a multiple personality.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.934
How do you know
which one I am?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.033
Because Mr. Fixit
and Boris use a key.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.133
Ah.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.400
All three of us have the same body,
but I don't get the key.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.467
Don't you get medication, Chuck?

07:05.533 --> 07:08.467
No. The doctor doesn't
prescribe it anymore.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.433
It doesn't stop
the multiple personalities.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.066
It just relieves anxiety.

07:12.133 --> 07:15.367
I'm not anxious.
I make other people anxious.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.033
-Hi, Chuckie.
-Hi, sis.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.533
You're over here early.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.200
I'm looking at apartments.

07:25.266 --> 07:28.367
The doctor says
I can get my own place,

07:28.433 --> 07:30.900
but who can afford
three bedrooms?

07:33.667 --> 07:35.400
Can I go upstairs
and see the dog?

07:35.467 --> 07:37.700
Sure, go ahead.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.066
Renee, we don't have a dog.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.867
If he thinks we do,
who am I to stop him?

07:42.934 --> 07:47.900
Maybe he sees things
we don't have the power to see.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.533
I read that the mentally ill
are the chosen.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.433
Who chooses them,
Shirley MacLaine?

08:00.100 --> 08:02.200
We've got to have a talk.

08:02.266 --> 08:04.967
-We have problems.
-(telephone rings)

08:05.033 --> 08:06.433
-Marital problems.
-Excuse me, honey.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
Hello. Yeah.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.200
Hello, Mr. Schecter.

08:12.266 --> 08:15.000
Oh, that is good news.
Great news.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.533
I'm happy for you.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.900
Congratulations.

08:17.967 --> 08:20.900
Goodbye, Mr. Schecter.
Mr. Schecter peed.

08:24.266 --> 08:26.000
He's 97.

08:26.066 --> 08:28.700
We're both very relieved.

08:28.767 --> 08:29.967
The catheter's no fun.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.433
So, what do you think?

08:31.500 --> 08:34.800
-It's thrilling to pee at 97.
-(doorbell rings)

08:34.867 --> 08:37.867
What about our marriage?
I'm worried about us.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.233
What do you mean?
We're great.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.200
I don't think we're great.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.233
Hi, Rose, Sophia.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.166
Hi. Come sit down.

08:46.233 --> 08:49.333
Sorry to barge in.
Is Mr. Fixit here?

08:49.400 --> 08:52.233
-Chuck is here.
-Oh, darn.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.834
Could he change into Mr. Fixit?

08:56.900 --> 09:00.166
It's a mental illness,
not a masquerade party.

09:00.233 --> 09:04.600
In Sicily, we had a guy
with multiple personalities.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.600
One personality put out
a contract on the other.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.100
He had a shootout with himself
in the Piazza.

09:12.166 --> 09:15.166
He winged a priest
and shot down the Cinzano sign.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.400
He beat himself senseless
before anyone else got hurt.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.934
George, I rewired
your phone system.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.967
You can call worldwide
free of charge.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.600
You can use your television remote

09:28.667 --> 09:30.734
to raise the windows
and flush the toilets.

09:32.900 --> 09:36.700
I'll run over to the freeway,
see if any cars need help.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.767
This guy knocks me out.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.633
Chuck, could you finish
our dishwasher first?

09:42.700 --> 09:45.166
I'm not Chuck. I'm Mr. Fixit.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.967
No problem too big or too small.

09:48.033 --> 09:50.266
This is better than vaudeville.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.367
I'm all yours, ladies.
Lead me to the trouble.

09:54.433 --> 09:57.400
There's nothing I can't fix,
except maybe this old noggin.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.533
That could use rewiring.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.133
Well, let's go.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.266
Come on, we don't
want to lose him. Bye.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.367
-I'd better get to the office.
-We're not done yet.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.500
Couldn't it wait?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.400
Well, no, it cannot wait.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.133
George, the kids are gone.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.767
And you're never here.
I have nothing to do anymore.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.133
What do your friends do?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
Shop, have lunch, some play
golf, some have affairs.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.066
-Which ones are having affairs?
-Oh, I don't know.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.367
Come on, I'll never tell.

10:25.433 --> 10:28.133
The ones who are happy for no
apparent reason.

10:28.633 --> 10:29.934
George.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.567
My life is empty.

10:32.066 --> 10:32.867
Why don't you get a job?

10:32.934 --> 10:34.834
Well, you know,
I was thinking of that.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.700
I could go back
to show business.

10:36.767 --> 10:40.066
Renee, you were the legs
in the dancing cigarette box.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.333
But he loved me.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.166
I brought joy to people.

10:43.233 --> 10:45.700
You sold cigarettes,
you brought cancer to people.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.266
No matter what you think, George,

10:49.333 --> 10:51.567
I'm going to try and get work
in the entertainment business.

10:51.633 --> 10:52.900
But that's not all.

10:52.967 --> 10:55.600
That's just my part.
You've got a part too.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.734
You've got to be here more.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.433
Well, you never
complained before.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.867
The kids were here, I didn't notice.

11:01.934 --> 11:04.667
But, George,
time is important now.

11:04.734 --> 11:08.367
And with them gone, we're supposed
to be together in a new way.

11:08.433 --> 11:12.500
I saw it on a coffee commercial,
I think taster's choice.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.533
This couple,
we're supposed to be like that.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.200
-Like what?
-Like this couple.

11:18.266 --> 11:21.333
They're there,
just the two of them.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.300
Sipping coffee together.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.967
For as long as they have left.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.767
Must be one hell
of a cup of coffee.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.100
I'm in real trouble here,
George.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.767
Our marriage is in real trouble.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.700
(telephone rings)

11:34.767 --> 11:37.033
Excuse me, honey.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.433
Hello.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.800
Yeah.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.500
Describe the pain.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.533
Huh-huh.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.233
Okay, meet me in my office.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.066
Yes, right now.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.033
I gotta go.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.767
-I gotta a sick person.
-I gotta a sick person.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.633
I'll see you later.
I love you.

11:55.533 --> 11:56.967
I love you too.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.100
A movie will cheer you up.

12:08.166 --> 12:09.066
What are you seeing?

12:09.133 --> 12:11.834
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street IV.</i>

12:11.900 --> 12:14.367
Do you have to see
the other three first?

12:14.433 --> 12:16.500
No, Rose, it stands alone.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.567
Hi, everybody.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.000
Jenny!

12:21.066 --> 12:23.333
Why are you home from school?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.400
-You're sick? You're pregnant.
-I quit.

12:25.467 --> 12:26.400
Thank God.

12:26.467 --> 12:27.834
You aren't mad?

12:27.900 --> 12:30.600
I'm glad you're not pregnant.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.533
Why did you quit?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.533
When I got there,

12:34.600 --> 12:37.967
I found my boyfriend practically
living with somebody else.

12:38.033 --> 12:39.100
He'd replaced me.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.266
With what?

12:42.633 --> 12:44.433
A hand puppet, Rose.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.300
Honey, I'm so sorry.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.900
You shouldn't have gone
to Columbia university.

12:52.967 --> 12:57.533
It's in New York City, for heaven's sake.
A subway runs right through it.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.633
You want to go to college

12:58.700 --> 13:02.033
where there are green lawns
and willow trees

13:02.100 --> 13:04.900
and young men
in chinos and ties.

13:04.967 --> 13:07.967
Professors with a touch of gray.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.934
Wise, learned men,
who look up your skirt

13:14.000 --> 13:15.567
if you're sitting in the first row.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.533
Meetings with them,
so they can explain Plato.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
They lean over your books,

13:22.667 --> 13:27.266
and you can smell their pipe tobacco
and their maleness.

13:29.500 --> 13:33.367
Then their arm accidentally
brushes against your bosoms.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.700
The room is filled with
the heat of a taboo lust.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.100
Where is this school?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.967
Jenny, what happened?

13:49.033 --> 13:52.133
He met a thin,
blonde Goddess.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.934
One of those girls
who has everything,

13:55.033 --> 13:58.800
looks, money, brains, a body,
and now, my boyfriend.

13:58.867 --> 14:02.000
I've been in that position
more than once.

14:02.066 --> 14:04.500
You've been in every position
more than once.

14:12.266 --> 14:13.433
My position?

14:13.500 --> 14:16.767
Oh, goodness, no.
The Goddess position.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.567
We have our problems too.

14:19.633 --> 14:22.900
Especially when the Goddess
is twice her previous size.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.266
Honey, I know what you're feeling.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.834
Everyone's been rejected.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.166
The loss of your first love
is the worst.

14:37.233 --> 14:40.867
-I know. I remember mine.
-It was probably a cow.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.266
How on earth did
you know that, Sophia?

14:46.767 --> 14:47.967
Wild guess.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.567
Mine was Larry Ragonetti.

14:51.633 --> 14:55.033
Oh, how I loved him.
He was gorgeous.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.266
He left me for Cookie Kelly.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.767
She kissed with her mouth open.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.333
Why didn't you kiss
with your mouth open?

15:02.400 --> 15:03.900
I was 8.

15:04.734 --> 15:06.100
So?

15:10.333 --> 15:13.800
It's happened to us all,
and we've all survived.

15:13.867 --> 15:14.800
Not me.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.333
Oh, come on, Blanche.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.200
You were never rejected?

15:18.266 --> 15:20.533
Well, once. But just once.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.133
By who?

15:22.200 --> 15:23.867
Weight watchers, for being too thin.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.900
-Come on, girls.
-Thanks for coming over.

15:28.967 --> 15:31.667
-Bye, honey.
-Bye, sweetheart.

15:31.734 --> 15:35.900
-Hello, ladies.
-Bye, George.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.800
Hi, George.
Bye, George.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.033
Hi, honey.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.667
Sweetheart!

15:40.734 --> 15:42.433
What are you doing home?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.266
She's not sick or pregnant.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.166
Is it thanksgiving already?

15:46.233 --> 15:47.333
Dennis dumped me.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.367
Sugar, I'm so sorry.

15:50.433 --> 15:53.200
I wish I could say something
to make you feel better.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.433
How about, I always hated him.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.800
Oh, Daddy.

15:56.867 --> 15:59.166
I know how much it hurts, darling.

15:59.233 --> 16:03.266
I've been rejected many times.
So has your daddy.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.834
I can't go back. I just can't.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.367
Suppose I run into them?

16:08.433 --> 16:10.900
-I'll die of embarrassment.
-No, you won't.

16:10.967 --> 16:12.233
I'm a doctor.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.600
I've never seen anyone
die of embarrassment.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.767
I'll tell you what.

16:17.834 --> 16:20.033
I'll go back and help
get you settled.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.500
-Will you?
-Absolutely.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.633
-Hi, everybody.
-Hi, Oliver.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.567
You want to know
who I slept with?

16:28.633 --> 16:31.834
-No, Oliver.
-The cabin crew of Lufthansa.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.467
So I have to go back?

16:34.533 --> 16:37.667
You're 18.
We're not going to force you.

16:37.734 --> 16:42.066
We will, however, cut you off
and never talk to you.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.834
So you strongly recommend...

16:43.900 --> 16:46.367
-Yes.
-Okay.

16:46.433 --> 16:47.767
I owe you a beer.

16:47.834 --> 16:51.600
I'll see some friends
before going back tomorrow.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.533
-Where you going?
-To school.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.100
-Flying?
-Yeah.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.166
You'd be safer hitching.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.600
Oliver, don't start.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.533
Test pilots know
what goes on up there.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.433
I don't need to hear this.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.233
Or what goes on in the cockpit.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.667
Hey, come on!

17:07.734 --> 17:09.500
-Goodbye, Oliver.
-Bye, Jen.

17:10.533 --> 17:11.567
Poor kid.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.467
Didn't we do the right thing?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.633
-Absolutely.
-Really?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.300
I don't know.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.233
George, take a look at this.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.367
This is a family discussion, Oliver.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.633
Hey, that's nice.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.567
I wish I had a family.

17:27.934 --> 17:30.100
-I think it's skin cancer.
-It's not.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.500
She has to go back.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.567
But if she actually
dies of embarrassment,

17:34.633 --> 17:36.533
I'll never forgive myself.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.333
So, what is this thing?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.600
A liver spot.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.567
Oh, no.

17:42.633 --> 17:45.800
Oh, God.
A liver spot?

17:45.867 --> 17:47.166
It's benign, Oliver.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.667
My father had liver spots.
He looked like a dalmatian.

17:51.533 --> 17:54.400
So, what's this family
talk about, guys?

17:54.467 --> 17:57.567
-It's private, Oliver.
-I see.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.433
-Would you excuse us?
-Sure.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.867
Get out of my house.

18:02.934 --> 18:04.867
-Oh, you mean go?
-Yes!

18:04.934 --> 18:07.633
Why didn't you say so?
See you, guys.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.066
-You know--
-What's that?

18:09.133 --> 18:10.667
-Oliver!
-I'm going.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.066
-What?
-We were great with Jen.

18:16.133 --> 18:19.500
-We were.
-We were a team.

18:19.567 --> 18:20.934
I want to be a team.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.033
What does that mean,
we should get uniforms?

18:24.100 --> 18:29.467
George, we just did something
together, and it felt great.

18:29.533 --> 18:31.967
We've got to do more of that
without the kids,

18:32.033 --> 18:33.266
but you're never here.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.834
What do you want?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.467
Cut back on your practice.

18:37.533 --> 18:42.300
Do I tell a guy in cardiac arrest,
"sorry, I'm meeting my wife"?

18:42.367 --> 18:46.667
Do you know why I'm going
to New York with Jenny?

18:46.734 --> 18:51.133
Not just to help her, to be
with someone who needs me.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.700
Think about it.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.500
Think about that.

18:55.567 --> 19:00.166
I've got the second half of my life
to take care of,

19:00.233 --> 19:02.066
and I don't want to do it alone.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.233
Then Renee calls up
and says she got herself an agent.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.633
Oh, nice.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.300
Not nice, Oliver, she's been in
New York, six days.

19:17.367 --> 19:20.200
Now, she's got an agent who says
she's perfect for commercials.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.600
Who knows what
she's gonna do.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.333
Wouldn't it be funny
if she never came back.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.133
(mouths)

19:29.500 --> 19:31.834
This house is so
empty without her.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.967
-I'm lonely.
-That's why I never got married.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.233
I didn't want to be lonely.

19:36.934 --> 19:39.500
And I didn't want somebody else
driving my car.

19:39.567 --> 19:40.967
You out of Perrier, George.

19:41.033 --> 19:43.767
This is probably what Renee was
talking about.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.033
-She was lonely.
-You're out of beer too.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.000
And peanut butter.

19:47.066 --> 19:50.033
Hell, George, you better get her
back, I'm gonna starve to death.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.266
(knock at door)

19:52.333 --> 19:54.000
Oh, Dorothy!

19:54.066 --> 19:56.266
-What a nice surprise.
-For you, maybe.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.433
George, let's talk.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.867
Do I detect a note of hostility?

19:59.934 --> 20:03.000
A note? How about a symphony?

20:03.066 --> 20:05.333
We thought you might join us
for dinner.

20:05.400 --> 20:09.300
I get the feeling you're mad.
Why is that?

20:09.367 --> 20:13.133
How about stopping by new year's eve
with three naked women,

20:13.200 --> 20:16.266
vomiting in the pool,
passing out in the punch bowl,

20:16.333 --> 20:18.967
and relieving yourself
in the linen closet?

20:20.700 --> 20:23.100
That was six months ago.

20:25.033 --> 20:27.967
George, what do you say?
We'd really love having you.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.600
Maybe some other time.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.133
What about forgive and forget, dot?

20:32.200 --> 20:34.300
I am not dot.
Goodbye, George.

20:35.300 --> 20:35.967
Bye, dot.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.033
-Where are you going?
-New York.

20:40.100 --> 20:40.934
Great. Let's do it.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.200
You're not invited.
I'm going alone.

20:43.266 --> 20:44.600
Yeah, but we could...

20:51.800 --> 20:53.266
Hi, ma.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.567
Hey, how would you like to have...

20:55.867 --> 20:58.333
Come on, Ma.
That was three, four months ago.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.767
(knock on door)

21:08.834 --> 21:10.066
Coming.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.633
Thank God you're here.
I was a wreck.

21:14.700 --> 21:19.500
Sitting there, night after night,
just lonely as hell,

21:19.567 --> 21:22.533
then I thought, what if I lose her?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.400
What would I do without her?

21:24.467 --> 21:27.333
I want her here with me,

21:27.400 --> 21:29.600
and I want to be there
with her too.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.600
So here I am.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.734
There will be changes made.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.900
I love you...

21:34.967 --> 21:38.967
What are you doing opening a door
here without saying, "who's there?"

21:39.467 --> 21:41.767
I wasn't going to stay here.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.367
I missed you. I couldn't stand it,

21:44.433 --> 21:47.233
and I've been going too fast
for you.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.000
You can't change overnight.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.433
I'd like to try.

21:51.533 --> 21:55.867
Here's step one,
I drew a sketch on the plane.

21:55.934 --> 21:59.400
I've decided to make
an office in the house

21:59.467 --> 22:01.734
and move my practice there.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.433
-No.
-Yeah.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.900
I got Maslansky
to take part of my patient load.

22:07.967 --> 22:10.734
In fact, he's taking it all
for the next three days,

22:10.800 --> 22:12.834
while we're here
on our second honeymoon.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.467
George, I love you.

22:18.367 --> 22:19.834
I love you too.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.533
But, honey, this isn't
our second honeymoon.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.934
It's our third?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.600
We never had one.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.533
Of course we had one--

22:28.600 --> 22:30.567
You were an intern.

22:30.633 --> 22:33.066
I don't call two hours
in an empty hospital bed

22:33.133 --> 22:35.300
next to a man in a coma
a honeymoon.

22:36.533 --> 22:38.467
He wasn't in a coma.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.734
I'll make it up
to you right now.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.100
How?

22:53.700 --> 22:57.567
Oh, George,
what a great three days.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.800
This has been
a wonderful honeymoon.

22:59.867 --> 23:02.166
It should be,
you've waited long enough.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.367
You think
we'll stay like this always?

23:09.433 --> 23:11.600
I think eventually
we'll have to go to the bathroom.

23:13.834 --> 23:16.500
-And you'll love me always?
-Always.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.333
I won't always look like this,
you know.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.033
You don't look like
you did 10 years ago,

23:22.100 --> 23:23.633
but that hasn't mattered.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.667
Promise me you'll never get
your teeth bonded

23:28.734 --> 23:30.266

You swear?

-Hmm?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.333
Promise me one more thing.
