01:41.433 --> 01:43.633
It's true.
You can see yourself.

01:49.066 --> 01:51.000
Did you make coffee?

01:54.100 --> 01:58.500
"Make coffee". What do I
look like? A percolator?

01:59.600 --> 02:03.300
Where do I come up with that?

02:03.333 --> 02:05.100
Of course I made coffee.

02:05.133 --> 02:08.166
I know you can't even speak
before you have your coffee.

02:08.199 --> 02:12.666
Question. What is that
on your face?

02:13.566 --> 02:17.066
Toilet paper.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.766
Why would you put
toilet paper on your face?

02:20.800 --> 02:23.533
I cut myself shaving.
Repeatedly.

02:23.566 --> 02:25.600
There's no hot water.

02:25.633 --> 02:26.766
I told Twinkacetti a week ago

02:26.800 --> 02:28.500
that the hot water‐heater
was acting up.

02:28.533 --> 02:30.200
I even sent him
a letter to complain.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.566
Did you mention the sink too?

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
What's wrong with the sink?

02:32.633 --> 02:34.733
It don't work.

02:34.766 --> 02:37.700
What? Well, oh.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.766
Well, it is not draining.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.633
Try turning on
the garbage disposal‐‐

02:40.666 --> 02:41.666
‐ That‐‐
‐ Just try.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.233
‐ Just‐‐
‐ That‐‐

02:43.266 --> 02:44.100
‐ Flick the switch.
‐ No, you turn that‐‐

02:44.133 --> 02:47.700
Balki, turn on
the garbage disposal.

02:47.733 --> 02:50.666
[garbage disposal whirring]

03:07.100 --> 03:11.466
Think I found the problem.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.800
What is it?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.700
It's the garbage disposal.

03:14.733 --> 03:16.400
Wait, I'll fix the sink.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.033
Balki, you don't
have to fix anything.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.100
I don't?

03:19.133 --> 03:21.133
That's Twinkacetti's
responsibility.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.466
Who do you think
fixed the doorbell?

03:22.500 --> 03:23.800
Me.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.500
What do you mean "me"?

03:25.533 --> 03:28.466
I don't mean you.
I mean me.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.466
I fixed the doorbell.
I fixed the oven.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.200
And now, I'm gonna
go fix the sink.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.800
Balki, Twinkacetti should have
repaired all those things.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.166
Why should Mr. Twinkacetti
fix our sink?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.100
Because it's not our sink.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.166
Oh..

03:43.433 --> 03:45.366
Whose sink is it?

03:47.233 --> 03:49.566
Twinkacetti is the landlord.
He owns the building

03:49.600 --> 03:51.633
and everything in it.
Including the kitchen sink.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.166
Why do you think we pay rent?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.733
For the privilege of sleeping
indoors without livestock.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.666
Balki, get off the boat
and join the world.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.466
[doorbell ringing]

04:09.133 --> 04:10.200
‐ Hi, guys.
‐ Jennifer.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.733
Wow.

04:19.366 --> 04:22.100
I just love those
bold American fashions.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.366
Balki, that's a towel.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.033
Well, of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

04:30.066 --> 04:34.166
Is it reversible?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.233
Well, I'd really
like to stay and chat

04:36.266 --> 04:38.566
but I need to use your shower.
Mine's broken again.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.666
Well, help yourself.
Uh, we only have cold water.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.800
Can you believe this building?

04:42.833 --> 04:44.766
I wish we could
do something about this.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.433
Well, I guess I just get started
on that garbage disposal.

04:48.466 --> 04:51.500
Wait a minute. We'll get
Twinkacetti to fix it.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.600
We could band together.

04:52.633 --> 04:55.500
If enough people wanna
change something, they can.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.100
We stopped the war.
We got women to vote.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.366
We came that close

04:59.400 --> 05:04.033
to getting daylight saving
set all year around.

05:04.066 --> 05:06.166
Cousin, Mr. Twinkacetti
is a land owner

05:06.200 --> 05:08.300
and we're just
lowly common peasants.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.600
Balki, this is a democracy.

05:10.633 --> 05:14.033
We're all created
equally lowly and common.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.300
We'll get all
the tenants together.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.800
Make out a list of complaints
and present them to Twinkacetti.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.566
He has to listen to us.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.666
Count me in. Oh and thanks
for letting me use your shower.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.733
Sure.

in a civilized manner.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.500
'Susan'.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.066
I've been trying
to get Twinkacetti

05:46.100 --> 05:47.533
to fix my ceiling
for three years.

05:47.566 --> 05:52.533
Dream on. The man's a rodent.

05:52.566 --> 05:57.666
Does anyone else's
living room tilt to the right?

05:57.700 --> 06:02.033
Yes. Balki.
Not a question, just a comment.

06:02.066 --> 06:07.166
This is wonderful. Here we are,
a group of total strangers

06:07.200 --> 06:10.566
brought together by a common
cause in the pursuit of justice

06:10.600 --> 06:15.800
and the American way.

06:15.833 --> 06:20.566
Well, thank you
for sharing that.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.400
Anything else?

06:22.433 --> 06:27.066
Yeah, who's gonna give this
grievance list to Twinkacetti?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.800
‐ Not me.
‐ We need a leader.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.200
Cousin Larry can be the leader.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.566
Larry, you'd be perfect.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.500
Yes, Larry.
You reek of leadership.

06:37.533 --> 06:41.766
Really? Well,
maybe I do reek a little.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.533
Of course, who's kidding who?
You reek all the time.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.533
All in favor of
Cousin Larry say barta.

06:52.566 --> 06:54.600
[in unison]
Barta.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.633
Well, okay.
Uh, I'll be the leader.

07:00.666 --> 07:04.500
I'll type up the letter to
Twinkacetti and send it to him.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.233
Isn't he something?

07:07.266 --> 07:10.433
We have leases and Twinkacetti
has got to live up to the leases

07:10.466 --> 07:11.700
Yeah.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.633
In a minute, Balki.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.666
In fact, I think
that we'll insist

07:16.700 --> 07:18.633
that he fix
everything on our list.

07:18.666 --> 07:22.466
You know, it is time
that we uh..

07:22.500 --> 07:23.733
placed our order for Tupperware.

07:23.766 --> 07:26.466
Um, who would like
the cold cuts keeper?

07:26.500 --> 07:29.133
Just raise your hand. One, two,
three, four, five six..

07:29.166 --> 07:30.533
Oh, hello, Mr. Twinkacetti.

07:30.566 --> 07:33.266
Tupperware, huh?

07:33.300 --> 07:37.233
Well, uh, actually we're here
because we have uh..

07:41.200 --> 07:44.333
...grievances.

07:44.366 --> 07:48.533
Roof, worn‐out carpet,
clogged disposal..

07:48.566 --> 07:50.566
You know I'd really
like to fix these things.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.433
‐ You would?
‐ Oh, yes.

07:52.466 --> 07:57.800
I‐ I just have a cash flow
problem I.. just this week.

07:57.833 --> 08:02.500
Both grandmothers, they
went in for heart transplants..

08:02.533 --> 08:04.300
No, please.

08:07.266 --> 08:09.133
Oh, you poor, poor man.

08:10.633 --> 08:14.033
And we think
we have problems.

08:14.066 --> 08:19.400
Balki, must you be the poster
child for the hopelessly naive?

08:19.433 --> 08:21.800
The man is lying.
He has no grandmothers.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.266
He probably sold them.

08:26.566 --> 08:28.366
You lied about your nana's?

08:30.566 --> 08:33.700
Look, you ingrates, you got no
right meeting here like this.

08:33.732 --> 08:39.066
Here's what I think
of your list of grievances..

08:39.100 --> 08:40.100
‐ Let's get him.
‐ Yeah!

Mrs. Schalgelmilch!

08:47.233 --> 08:52.066
People, you are turning
into an ugly mob.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.033
Well, not you, Jennifer.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.433
We can still work
within the system.

08:58.466 --> 08:59.566
Cousin Larry is right.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.100
We study something like this
in my citizenship class.

09:02.133 --> 09:05.133
Listen to this man.
He knows his history.

09:05.166 --> 09:09.300
The Boston Tea Party. If people
are angry with King George

09:09.333 --> 09:12.666
because they pay him tax money
but he don't listen to them.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.066
So, they protest
by the get‐together

09:16.100 --> 09:20.166
and they dip his tea bags in
the filthy, dirty harbor water

09:21.833 --> 09:23.666
and they don't
pay the tax money.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.566
But if we protest
by get‐together

09:25.600 --> 09:27.200
and don't pay our rent money.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.233
What would you
call that, Cousin Larry?

09:29.266 --> 09:30.733
Well, I'd call it a rent‐strike.

09:30.766 --> 09:32.600
Cousin Larry
calls a rent‐strike.

09:32.633 --> 09:36.433

who you're dealing with here.

What's going on?
It must be 30 degrees.

10:18.766 --> 10:22.033
25, I checked.

10:22.066 --> 10:23.566
Why is the furnace off?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.600
Why didn't my
electric blanket work?

10:25.633 --> 10:29.500
Why are you
cooking over a candle?

10:29.533 --> 10:32.733
These are easy questions.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.700
We have no heat
or electricity

10:34.733 --> 10:37.466
because Mr. Twinkacetti
turned them off.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.266
How do you like your egg?

10:41.300 --> 10:45.366
Loose, I hope.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.600
Twinkacetti is
playing really dirty.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.300
Nobody can survive
like this here.

10:49.333 --> 10:53.766
Give me that.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.633
You know, the trouble
with you Americans

10:56.666 --> 10:59.233
is you can't take
a little hardship.

10:59.266 --> 11:01.800
You know, in Mypos,
we lived with it constantly.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.600

staring back at them.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.600
Mama asked me to help out

11:25.633 --> 11:29.033
by selling fig cakes
on the street corner.

11:29.066 --> 11:32.133
And we only have just the one
road running through my village.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.033
So, I had to walk 50 miles
to find a street corner.

11:44.466 --> 11:47.566
And by the time I get there,
I ate all my fig cakes.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.700
Now, there's true hardship.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.566
No.

12:02.133 --> 12:05.133
No, true hardship
is listening to that story.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.733
I'm gonna make some coffee.

12:09.766 --> 12:10.766
That's what I need.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.733
'Well, about that coffee.'

12:12.766 --> 12:14.633
Mr. Twinkacetti also
turned off the water.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.600
So you can't have that.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.766
Oh my God. I‐I have to have
coffee to‐to cope, to exist

12:25.800 --> 12:28.800
I need it to uh‐to uh..
what do you call that..

12:28.833 --> 12:31.400
When you‐ When you make up
things in your mind. Think!

12:38.333 --> 12:40.066
I can't think!

12:42.300 --> 12:44.366
I know. I'll go to the
coffee shop in the corner.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.800
‐ Not open yet.
‐ Damn!

12:46.833 --> 12:48.400
I have to have coffee.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.433
I know. I'll make it
with Ginger Ale.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.266
You can't heat it up.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.766
Alright, we'll make a fire.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.400
We have no firewood.

12:56.433 --> 13:01.233
Break up the furniture.

13:05.733 --> 13:09.700
‐ I don't think so.
‐ Why not?

13:09.733 --> 13:10.800
We're not going to burn
the furniture

13:10.833 --> 13:13.533
to make a cup of coffee.

13:13.566 --> 13:16.066
Coffee..

13:16.100 --> 13:18.700
I think you've reached
the end of the pier again

13:18.733 --> 13:20.366
You gotta get
a grip on yourself.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.566
You're right. You're right.

13:22.600 --> 13:27.666
I've‐ I've got to get control.
I've got to keep my wits.

13:48.766 --> 13:50.700
Vinnie, this is Twinky.

13:50.733 --> 13:55.033
I wanna put a grant on
Chocoholic to win in the fifth.

13:55.066 --> 13:56.633
Yeah, of course
I'm good for it.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.200
You think you can
handle this without coffee?

14:11.233 --> 14:13.600
I'm fine. Let me at him.

14:13.633 --> 14:15.533
Top of the mornin', boys.

14:15.566 --> 14:18.400
Did we all sleep warm and
snuggly? Well, I sure did.

14:20.100 --> 14:24.733
Mr. Twinkacetti,
in the middle of the night

14:24.766 --> 14:28.566
you turned off
our‐our‐our, uh, the uh..

14:28.600 --> 14:30.033
‐ Water.
‐ water.

14:30.066 --> 14:30.766
And our.. And our.. And our..
you know the..

14:30.800 --> 14:33.766
[Larry imitating static]

14:33.800 --> 14:36.233
‐ Electricity.
‐ Electricity!

14:36.266 --> 14:38.100
And I am.. I am..

14:38.133 --> 14:40.366
‐ Larry Appleton.
‐ Larry Appleton. I know that!

14:40.400 --> 14:41.800
It's everything else,
I don't know!

14:41.833 --> 14:44.566
Uh, did you boys
come in here to give up?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.666
‐ Oh. Hmm.
‐ Just stand over there.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.233
Yeah.

14:49.266 --> 14:52.600
You know, in Mypos, we have
a word for people like you.

14:52.633 --> 14:53.600
You're a..

14:53.633 --> 14:55.566
[speaking in foreign language]

14:57.433 --> 15:01.266
Gee, take that back, please.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.766
What is a riga‐morchatochus?

15:05.800 --> 15:10.800
It's a by‐product
of swamp slime.

15:10.833 --> 15:15.333
Mr. Twinkacetti, you are
playing really dirty.

15:15.366 --> 15:17.333
But you cannot push us.

15:17.366 --> 15:20.566
We‐We have.. We have..

15:20.600 --> 15:23.566
[sniffing]

15:23.600 --> 15:25.666
Is that fresh coffee I smell?

15:25.700 --> 15:28.100
Fresh hot coffee.
Have some, Appleton.

15:30.066 --> 15:33.300
Special of the day.
Only ten bucks a cup.

15:33.333 --> 15:37.533
$10 for coffee?
That is outrageous.

15:37.566 --> 15:41.100
Balki, lend me $5.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.033
Get a grip on yourself.

15:43.066 --> 15:45.233
You're going to pay $10
for a stupid beverage?

15:45.266 --> 15:47.700
Yes! And don't you
ever call it stupid.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.100
Here's for half a cup.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.700
Oh‐h‐h, that's good.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.533
Alright now, Twinkacetti.
What was I talking about?

16:04.200 --> 16:08.700
I noticed you turned off
our heat and our water and..

16:08.733 --> 16:11.200
‐ And electricity.
‐ You think you're tough?

16:11.233 --> 16:13.733
You don't know what tough is!

16:13.766 --> 16:17.266
This is tough.
I am tough.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.666
In fact, I don't even
need your stinkin' coffee.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.300
You should see him
after a second cup.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.600
O‐o‐oh.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.033
I can take whatever
you can dish out.

16:35.066 --> 16:36.566
In fact, we're not giving in

16:36.600 --> 16:39.333
until you fix
everything on our list.

16:39.366 --> 16:43.166
You heard that right. You better
start respecting Cousin Larry.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.266
Oh, but I do, Turnip.
I respect Cousin Larry

16:46.300 --> 16:49.266
just as much as I respect
Cousin Bo and Cousin Curley.

16:55.166 --> 16:58.600
Cousin, why you didn't introduce
me to the rest of the family?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.165
I forgot.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.000
[instrumental music]

17:15.444 --> 17:20.044
Alright people, it's 7'o clock.
Remember we're trespassing.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.078
Balki, get 'em moving.

17:22.111 --> 17:27.243
[Balki imitating a shepherd]

17:27.278 --> 17:28.611
Well, it's not exactly home.

17:28.644 --> 17:32.178
But it's warmer
than my apartment.

17:32.211 --> 17:33.378
I can't sleep
on the floor anymore.

17:33.411 --> 17:38.344
I'm getting a
flat spot on my hair.

17:38.378 --> 17:42.011
He's here. It's Twinkacetti.
He's early. Everybody hide.

17:56.511 --> 17:58.644
Would you look at this?
They left the lights on.

17:58.678 --> 18:03.944
Even a chimpanzee could turn off
lights and be better company.

18:03.978 --> 18:06.944
[instrumental music]

18:13.611 --> 18:19.078
Who is it?
Come out. Come on.

18:23.444 --> 18:27.944
Morning.
Lovely hair.

18:27.978 --> 18:32.211
Hello. Warm?

18:32.244 --> 18:34.278
‐ Schalgelmilch.
‐ Rodent.

18:38.944 --> 18:41.278
I know what you're going to
say Mr. Twinkacetti

18:41.311 --> 18:43.211
but this is all your fault.

18:43.244 --> 18:44.444
Yeah, if you didn't
turn our heat off

18:44.478 --> 18:45.911
we wouldn't have to sleep here.

18:45.944 --> 18:47.678
I know it's my fault.
And I'm sorry.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.944
Oh, no. You're not gonna
get away with.. hmm?

18:50.978 --> 18:54.478
Hey, all men
are brothers, right?

18:54.511 --> 18:56.911
Who is this man?

18:56.944 --> 18:58.578
I would like to end
our little disagreement.

18:58.611 --> 18:59.644
[phone ringing]

18:59.678 --> 19:01.911
You think I like to
make people suffer, do you?

19:01.944 --> 19:03.644
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yes.

19:03.678 --> 19:07.511
Now, that hurts. Look, I'm
willing to make a few repairs

19:07.544 --> 19:09.511
if you're willing to
pay the rent today.

19:09.544 --> 19:13.511
Mr. Twinkacetti, it's a friend
for you. Mr. Vinnie The Finger.

19:16.311 --> 19:18.344
I'm not here, Turnip!

19:18.378 --> 19:22.278
He says "I'm not here, Turnip".

19:24.444 --> 19:29.178
Oh. Well, okay. Nice chatting
with your Mr. The Finger, bye.

19:32.278 --> 19:35.211
Vinnie says he wants
to take you fishing

19:35.244 --> 19:37.511
and to buy you a concrete vest.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.911
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

19:40.944 --> 19:42.178
Nice man.

19:44.178 --> 19:48.078
Oh‐h‐h. Balki, Balki,
that was his bookie.

19:48.111 --> 19:49.344
He needs money.

19:52.711 --> 19:55.178
‐ Our rent money.
‐ Ye‐e‐es.

19:55.211 --> 19:58.311
‐ We got him.
‐ Yeah.

19:58.344 --> 20:00.344
Listen, people.
This is more than a business.

20:00.378 --> 20:02.378
My life is at stake.
Doesn't anyone care?

20:07.078 --> 20:09.444
That silence is like
a nail in my heart.

20:09.478 --> 20:14.178
Listen, slug. I want my front
door fixed. By tomorrow.

20:14.211 --> 20:16.644
You got it, Schalgelmilch.

20:16.678 --> 20:19.011
‐ We want our places painted.
‐ Painted, right.

20:19.044 --> 20:22.611
‐ And fumigated.
‐ Okay, you got a deal!

20:22.644 --> 20:25.511
[all cheering]

20:29.211 --> 20:32.578
People, listen.
Don't you see what's happening?

20:32.611 --> 20:36.944
We have not won. He has not
given us everything on the list.

20:36.978 --> 20:38.478
Bartokomous, if I could get
you everything on that list

20:38.511 --> 20:42.278
I won't have any more
money for anything else.

20:46.011 --> 20:50.678
What do you think? I just
fell off the turnip truck?

20:50.711 --> 20:54.311
Well, I didn't. I jumped off
with my own two feet.

20:56.978 --> 20:58.411
Now, Max.

20:58.444 --> 21:01.644
You said that the building
needs a new washer and drier.

21:01.678 --> 21:06.111
‐ Right.
‐ Uh, okay?

21:06.144 --> 21:09.178
And‐and‐and Susan, you‐you need
your ceiling fixed.

21:09.211 --> 21:14.278
The whole thing?
Uh, uh okay.

21:14.311 --> 21:16.578
Miss Schalgelmilch,
your carpeting.

21:16.611 --> 21:17.678
You're pushing me!

21:17.711 --> 21:19.978
I'm going to call
Mr. The Finger.

21:20.011 --> 21:23.211
Okay. Okay. Okay!
But that's it!

21:23.244 --> 21:25.411
Well, I got what I wanted.

21:25.444 --> 21:30.444
Now get Norma Rae outta here.

21:30.478 --> 21:33.944
Oh no, wait. There's more thing
on the list. We can fight!

21:33.978 --> 21:36.511
We can hold out! We can win!

21:36.544 --> 21:39.311
Oh, some other time, kid.
I gotta get to work.

21:39.344 --> 21:42.011
Yeah. I gotta go
look for a job.

21:42.044 --> 21:44.011
Thanks for everything, Balki.

21:44.044 --> 21:46.244
But, we don't have everything.

21:46.278 --> 21:49.011
What about remodeling
the recreation room?

21:49.044 --> 21:51.511
‐ Yeah!
‐ What about air‐conditioning?

21:51.544 --> 21:54.178
‐ Air‐conditioning!
‐ What about security system?

21:54.211 --> 21:57.544
‐ Balki, it's over.
‐ Okay.

21:57.578 --> 22:00.311
[instrumental music]

22:04.578 --> 22:09.411
Hey, this is great.
Look, I can't see my breath.

22:09.444 --> 22:10.878
The heat is on.

22:16.611 --> 22:20.144
Balki, what are you doing?

22:20.178 --> 22:25.011
I must sit among the ashes.

22:25.044 --> 22:30.244
No, don't sit among the ashes.

22:30.278 --> 22:34.478
I am humiliated.
I make a fool of myself.

22:34.511 --> 22:39.311
No, you didn't. You made
a lot of people very happy.

22:39.344 --> 22:41.478
[instrumental music]

22:41.511 --> 22:44.978
I don't understand
why they're happy. We lose.

22:45.011 --> 22:47.544
We didn't lose. Twinkacetti's
gonna spend two months

22:47.578 --> 22:49.211
fixing this place up.

22:49.244 --> 22:51.244
But, we don't get
everything on the list.

22:51.278 --> 22:53.611
We never planned to get
everything on the list.

22:53.644 --> 22:55.478
Cousin, you said to
Mr. Twinkacetti

22:55.511 --> 22:58.978
that we will not quit
until we get everything

22:59.011 --> 23:01.011
and I want to do what you said.

23:01.044 --> 23:04.144
That's called negotiating.
You ask for more than you want

23:04.178 --> 23:06.511
so you get what you need.

23:06.544 --> 23:09.144
Then, why don't you just
ask for what you need?

23:09.178 --> 23:14.044
‐ Because you won't get it.
‐ You're right, I don't get it.

23:14.078 --> 23:16.678
Balki, you did a great job.

23:16.711 --> 23:18.111
‐ I did?
‐ You did.

23:18.144 --> 23:19.578
‐ I did good?
‐ You did great.

23:19.611 --> 23:22.644
You got us more than
we ever expected.

23:22.678 --> 23:25.344
You're a very good negotiator.
You stood up to Twinkacetti.

23:25.378 --> 23:27.278
[instrumental music]

23:27.311 --> 23:29.178
I guess I did.

23:29.211 --> 23:33.278
You were going to stop
before we got washer and drier.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.978
This building is very lucky

23:35.011 --> 23:37.144
to have
Balki Bartokomous living here.

23:37.178 --> 23:40.611
‐ Really?
‐ I know I'm better off.

23:40.644 --> 23:46.011
Hi. I just want to say
thank you. You were terrific.

23:46.044 --> 23:47.444
Oh, well, you know, I‐‐

23:47.478 --> 23:52.211
‐ I was talking to Balki.
‐ I knew that.

23:52.244 --> 23:56.278
You were magnetic.

23:56.311 --> 23:59.311
She called me a magnet.

24:01.078 --> 24:04.211
You've got guts, Balki.
I like that in a refugee.

24:07.011 --> 24:08.911
How about coming up
to my place for breakfast?

24:08.944 --> 24:10.344
Would you like that?

24:10.378 --> 24:12.311
Does the sheep
like potato root?

24:18.578 --> 24:21.244
That means yes,
you little lamb kebab.

24:25.211 --> 24:26.611
Don't wait up.

24:28.078 --> 24:30.211
I'm going to negotiate with her.
