STELLA: 'She was a mate of Maisy's
from the stables.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.520
'No-one's looking for her.'

00:03.560 --> 00:05.360
Do the police even know?
Do they care?

00:05.400 --> 00:08.720
Grandad wants to see you.
Why? Cos he's dying.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.040
You called him
The Millfields Monster.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.200
ERIC: 'One minute, he'd be fine,
the next minute,

00:13.240 --> 00:15.760
'he'd completely lose it.'

00:15.800 --> 00:18.440
You're nothing like me!
Nothing like me!

00:18.480 --> 00:21.040
REMY: 'After what you said
about Cleo, I had a look into it.'

00:21.080 --> 00:23.480
And?
'A week before she disappeared,

00:23.520 --> 00:26.400
'she called the police.
She said she had information

00:26.440 --> 00:28.560
'she wanted to share
about Maisy's murder.'

00:28.600 --> 00:29.720
Who are you?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.760
I don't suppose you know
where she is, do you?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.920
I'm kinda worried about her.
I didn't know her well.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.920
JAMAL: 'Who's that?'
CHARLES: 'That's Karl McKeller.'

00:36.960 --> 00:40.480
I hope for both of our sakes,
Charlie, that you'll stop talking.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.280
You've got a fella on the go.
Who is it?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.640
'It's Kelvin. Owns the stables.'

00:44.680 --> 00:46.800
I've still got this.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.280
I thought it might help you
in looking for her.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.720
CLEO: 'Maisy, what are you doing?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.120
'If he finds out we've been in here,
we're in so much shit.'

Stella?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.800
What are you doing in here?

03:31.840 --> 03:33.760
Can you stop shining the...?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.560
I wanna talk to you.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.920
About what?
LAUGHTER FROM VIDEO

03:41.960 --> 03:43.800
'If he finds out we've been in here,

03:43.840 --> 03:46.840
'we're gonna get in so much shit.'
'He won't even notice.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.920
'I can't do it.'
'Maisy, quick, someone's coming.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.480
Shh! Maisie, come on, come on!'
'Shit. Let's go.'

03:51.520 --> 03:55.120
Look, I had no idea
what the girls were getting up to.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.560
You knew summat was going on,
didn't ya?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.040
What?

03:59.080 --> 04:00.640
No.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.360
Course not.
Look, I'm as shocked as you, love.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.400
Are you telling me you do not know
what is going on on your own land?

04:07.440 --> 04:10.160
I hardly spend any time in here.
Look at the state of it.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.480
Look, I'm sorry, love. I'm...

04:14.600 --> 04:16.520
I don't know what to say.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.000
No, cos you're full of shit,
aren't you?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.320
Teddy?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.360
'You all right?'
Yeah. Go on.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.440
It's Grandad.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.480
He's gone.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.320
'Dad?'

05:04.360 --> 05:06.480
Yeah. Thanks for calling.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.840
Er, the funeral's
gonna be in a few days.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.680
Erm, if you're allowed,
will you come?

05:12.840 --> 05:14.600
'You can ask for permission.'

05:16.640 --> 05:20.400
Where was he?
'I was with him, Dad, at home.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.240
'He died in his sleep. It was...

05:22.280 --> 05:24.680
'Yeah, it was peaceful, like.'
Good boy.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.880
TEDDY CRIES

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Dad, you should come to the funeral
cos you'll regret it if you don't.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.440
'I'll let you get on.'
No. Dad!

05:32.480 --> 05:34.280
'Dad!'
I've gotta go.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.800
Can I just have a minute, please?

06:24.120 --> 06:25.840
JESSIE: Our Janice got me that.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.120
It's not my cup of tea.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.200
Well, it's kind of lovely.
And what about this one?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.480
How much for the stallion?
Make it a fiver.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.760
It's daylight robbery.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.560
David Dickinson'd twist his melon
for some of this.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.680
You all right, darling?
Yeah. Nice to see ya.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.440
Oh, just got one on the hook.
I'll see ya in a bit.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.880
How you doing?

06:45.920 --> 06:49.080
Yeah, I'm all right. Where's Kelvin?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.840
He's getting us a drink.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.280
He told me, love. About the video.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.840
Must've been a proper shock,
seeing that.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.040
Bet your head's scrambled.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.800
Ta, love.
Here you go, love. Hi, Stella.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.160
You all right?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.800
Sorry. I didn't know you'd be
popping by. Do you want one?

07:10.920 --> 07:14.160
Yeah, I'll have a coffee, thanks.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.240
How long do you say you'd known him?

07:20.280 --> 07:23.040
I didn't. You never asked.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.240
Since he took over the stables.
About five years back.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.440
Oh, right. He knew Maisy well, then?

07:31.480 --> 07:32.920
Don't, Stella.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.640
Please, for me.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.960
He didn't know.
He's got nowt to do wi' it.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.720
Mum, it happened on his land.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.280
Well, that don't make him guilty.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.320
So, you don't know
anything about it?

07:44.360 --> 07:48.280
That stuff that happened
was out of hours. Not on my watch.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.480
Anyway... where did you and Paul
think she were?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.560
Do you know, after everything
that I've been through,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.120
I thought, for once, you might
just back me, your daughter,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.320
instead of some fella.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.800
That's not fair.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.800
Anyway, you're one to talk.
What's that meant to mean?

08:06.840 --> 08:09.520
Don't think I don't know about
these meetings with that monster.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.840
He's got ya pointing your finger
at everyone but him.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.720
What are you now,
Charles Stone's puppet?

08:13.760 --> 08:15.640
You're pathetic. Piss off.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.440
What's gone on?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.240
Someone took it all.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.680
Who? What did you do?

08:36.720 --> 08:38.160
I didn't do nothing.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.000
Look, Jamal...

08:46.040 --> 08:47.800
You humiliated me out there.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.400
Made me look weak,
and they all saw it.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.000
And they're taking the piss now.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.960
Did you ever have any involvement
with, er, the stables in Millfields?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.120
Did you deal there?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.160
No. Why? Have you heard something?

09:30.200 --> 09:33.160
Listen, us meeting like this,
people are taking notice.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.760
I'm risking a lot
just by talking to you.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.160
You can't keep me in the dark.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.720
Maisy and Cleo were mates.
They went to the stables together.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.200
HE SIGHS

09:57.760 --> 09:59.840
Did you know they were mates?
No.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.280
I'd never met her.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.880
They were
doing drugs together there.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.120
How long were you working for them?
The McKellers.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.520
Most of my life.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.840
Started hanging around with them
when we moved to Millfields.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.840
And their family sort of took me in,
you know.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.720
How did your dad feel about that?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.760
He wasn't around.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.760
He was a lorry driver.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.640
So he'd spend weeks away
on the road.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.240
And when he was home,
he'd just sit in his chair, asleep,

10:43.280 --> 10:45.360
till it was time
to be driving again.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.800
He seemed so weak to me.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.320
I wanted him to be strong.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.840
I wanted him to be a man.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.120
He passed away last night.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.240
He came here. I saw him.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.200
This whole thing,
it took its toll on him.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.160
He died thinking I was guilty.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.800
You can't blame him.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.800
It was an open-and-shut case.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.680
Your DNA was everywhere.
I saw you...

11:28.720 --> 11:32.440
They were only looking for my DNA.
They already had their man.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.360
Let me ask you this.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.120
When you came to court that day,

11:36.160 --> 11:39.200
did you have any doubt whatsoever
that it was me?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.680
They screwed us both, Stella.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.840
They've robbed me of my life,

11:48.880 --> 11:51.360
and they never found the person
who killed Maisy.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.920
Erm, you said it was the McKellers
that sent you, so which one?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.680
I just got a message
with the address

11:59.720 --> 12:01.560
and the make of the car on it.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.640
Honestly.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
That's it.
It could have been anyone of 'em.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.600
They all use burner phones.
They do it for protection.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.160
So there's no paper trail,
no trace, nothing.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.880
You think Maisy
was buying off the McKellers?

12:16.640 --> 12:17.960
I never said that.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.480
You didn't need to.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.280
She ever get into any trouble?
Anything like...

12:24.320 --> 12:25.920
No.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.520
I'd have known about it.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.000
You didn't know about Cleo.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.920
DOOR LOCK BUZZES
MAN: Time's up, folks.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.600
Stella...

12:39.040 --> 12:41.480
..I've got a phone in here.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.200
Right.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.840
Means we can talk,
outside of this room. Privately.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.880
Time's running out, all right?

12:49.920 --> 12:52.320
If you find something,
you need to tell me.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.560
Thanks for coming.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.800
JESSIE: Shovelled so much shit.
God, you should have seen it.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.040
KELVIN: Do you know what?

13:19.080 --> 13:21.000
Charlie's really playing up
these days.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.960
Oh, he's been odd.
Have you put him vegan?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.320
What? No.
What you feeding him?

13:25.360 --> 13:28.800
Oh! What you doing here?

13:30.880 --> 13:34.160
I asked her to come over.
Sort this out.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.080
Kelvin, you don't have
to do anything. Jessie, please.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.160
Gotta tell you something,
and I wanted you both here.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.840
What's going on?

13:43.880 --> 13:46.200
I can't stand you two fighting
cos of me.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.440
And I don't wanna lie to you, love.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.200
Then don't.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.560
Yeah.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.200
Yeah, well... we're going back
a few years now.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.120
I caught some lads in the caravan
late one night.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.720
They were just messing about.
Who?

14:05.760 --> 14:08.240
I didn't see. I shouted at them,
they legged it.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.920
I went in after,
and I saw they'd been doing drugs.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.640
Thought they might be selling.
I don't want to hear about drugs.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.280
Jessie, please.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.200
I-I-I really didn't know what to do.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.960
Go on.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.880
The next day, I get a donation
for the community riding school.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.240
I know what for.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.360
To not say owt.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.280
You know I don't ask
a lot of those kids to pay.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.720
I just wanted
to keep the stables going.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.560
Truth be told, Stella, I was scared.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.680
Scared to try and move the lads on.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.280
Who did you get the money from?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.600
I can't risk telling you.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.800
Oh...

14:54.840 --> 14:56.520
Come on, Kelvin, spit it out.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.360
Roman McKeller.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.480
I really don't think
it was a big operation, Stella.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.400
Just some lads
looking to stash their gear.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.880
Selling to young teenagers
at your stables?

15:17.720 --> 15:19.840
How long ago did it stop?

15:21.120 --> 15:24.200
A few years back. Not long after
that night I caught them.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.520
Was that before or after
my daughter was murdered?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.520
Not long after.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.760
I'm so sorry, love.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.800
Stella...
Stella!

FRONT DOOR
OPENS AND CLOSES

17:57.480 --> 17:58.960
Paul?

18:03.440 --> 18:07.520
So, you didn't know that she was...
taking drugs and having sex?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.480
Of course not. She was 14.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.160
I've never heard
anyone call her Misty.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.680
So you're investigating
our own daughter now?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.680
Just come round here,
let yourself in,

18:20.720 --> 18:22.560
just rummage through her stuff.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.120
To be honest, Paul,
I didn't think I'd be welcome.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.440
Where's Meera?

18:33.480 --> 18:36.240
She's gone to stay with her parents
for a few days.

18:39.880 --> 18:43.560
I would've let you in, you know,
if you'd have asked.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.040
Course I would.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.760
I always wanted
to go through her things with you.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.920
What do you mean?

18:53.120 --> 18:55.560
You just left, Stella.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.400
I know.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.080
I'm sorry.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.480
It's OK. I get it.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.320
We both dealt with things
differently. We always did.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.400
I'm not saying
mine was the right way.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.520
Our daughter was out there,

19:27.560 --> 19:30.680
getting up to... God knows what.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.320
How did we miss it?

19:35.720 --> 19:39.600
How did we not see
that she was acting up?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.200
She must have been...

19:42.400 --> 19:43.840
..so unhappy.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.200
I did.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.280
What?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.320
Paul, what you on about?

20:02.360 --> 20:06.520
There was an incident at school.
And they called me in.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.240
What incident?

20:08.280 --> 20:12.720
She got into a fight with Aashna.
It got physical.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.920
They had a fight?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.560
What was it about?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.880
Dunno.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.840
She wouldn't say.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.440
And what, you just let that go?
Why didn't you say anything to me?

20:25.680 --> 20:27.120
I was scared to.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.320
SHE SIGHS

20:32.360 --> 20:34.840
I think she'd found out
about me and Meera.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.280
Fucking hell, Paul, are you joking?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.400
How? How did she know?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.280
She borrowed my phone once.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.000
I wasn't thinking.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.880
I'm so sorry.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.320
Why wasn't I enough, Paul?

20:58.480 --> 21:02.240
Stella... I wasn't enough for you.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.600
You'd pulled away from me.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.240
You were never home.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.920
You chose to work
when you didn't have to.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.040
And we both knew
we were growing apart.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.720
No, that's not fair.
That's not true.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.280
I couldn't make you happy
any more, Stel.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.120
Maisy was the only reason
we were still together.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.160
And I think she knew it.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.480
Hi, Aashna.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.840
Hi.
You look smart.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.520
I got some work experience
with a friend of my mum's.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.640
It's marketing stuff.
Didn't think I'd stick it out.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.000
Look, thanks for... meeting with me.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.760
I just wanted to ask you some things
about Maisy.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.760
I've heard that you two had
a falling out before she died.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.680
I just wondered
if you'd seen this girl before.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.560
No.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.880
She was a mate of Maisy's.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.440
I heard they were
doing drugs together.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.320
You and Maisy ever do that?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.960
I won't say anything.

22:52.440 --> 22:57.400
I saw her taking drugs.
Pills at house parties.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.600
Do you know where she got them?

23:02.560 --> 23:06.000
She can't get in trouble
any more, so...

23:07.520 --> 23:08.920
Her boyfriend.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.480
What was his name?
She never said his name.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.640
Was proper secretive about him.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.200
That's why we fell out.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.200
What happened?

23:22.320 --> 23:24.800
She flipped, attacked me.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.840
I didn't think she'd react that way.
I'd never seen her like that before.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.840
Why would she do that?

23:34.320 --> 23:36.080
Because I told people.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.800
That she was
going out with a drug dealer.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.480
DIALLING TONE

24:35.600 --> 24:37.360
CHARLES: 'Yeah. I'm here.'

24:39.240 --> 24:40.760
Erm...

24:42.160 --> 24:43.600
..Roman McKeller.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.280
'What do you know about him?'

24:45.320 --> 24:47.040
Why?

24:47.080 --> 24:50.320
The drugs the girls were taking
at the stables...

24:52.400 --> 24:54.160
He's connected with it.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.920
'He paid the owner to keep quiet.'

24:57.960 --> 24:59.680
Are you sure?

24:59.720 --> 25:01.360
Yeah.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.200
I'm sure.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.320
'Can you hear me?'

25:08.360 --> 25:10.040
Yeah, I'm here.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.480
It's just he runs things.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.200
Big things.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.240
And it's just kids messing around.

25:19.280 --> 25:23.000
Doesn't seem like the kind of thing
he'd get involved with.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.600
Well, it's the only connection
we have between us

25:26.640 --> 25:28.240
to Maisy and Cleo.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.560
Do you think
he might've been the one

25:34.600 --> 25:36.280
that sent you there that night?

25:38.440 --> 25:40.960
Again, it's just not usual.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.120
That's more of a middle man thing.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.960
But, yeah, it's possible.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.640
How do I get to him?

25:52.680 --> 25:53.960
You don't.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.280
It's too dangerous.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.760
Just tell me
where to find him, Charles.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.680
MUSIC: 'The Only One I Know'
by The Charlatans

27:03.080 --> 27:04.920
You all right, Stella?

27:04.960 --> 27:06.520
'Ey up, Roman.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.440
Didn't think you knew me.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.800
Everyone does.
After what happened to your lass.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.000
I was hoping we could have a chat.

27:16.040 --> 27:19.360
Yeah. Let's get a drink, eh?

27:20.520 --> 27:21.880
What's your tipple?

27:21.920 --> 27:24.400
Erm, I'm all right, ta.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.400
Oh. Cracking buffet, though.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.640
There's a new farm shop opened
just off Mansfield Road.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.320
You should try these sausages.
Spicy, mind.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.200
I'm all right.
You sure?

27:34.240 --> 27:35.560
Yeah, thanks.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.960
Mmm.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.760
I heard you were back in Millfields.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.360
Yeah, on and off.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.760
Are you keeping tabs on me?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.040
Just in a neighbourly way.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.320
I also heard
you were visiting Charles Stone.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.960
What you doing that for?

28:01.240 --> 28:05.280
He, erm... reached out
through a scheme.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.360
It just helps people
to deal with the past.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.360
So, you've forgiven him, then?

28:13.480 --> 28:15.680
It doesn't work like that.
How does it work?

28:17.520 --> 28:20.160
Erm, you just get to know the person

28:20.200 --> 28:26.360
and then... it helps you try and
find out why they did what they did.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.200
Oh, aye. So what have you found out?

28:31.360 --> 28:34.240
That you knew each other.
Mm-hm.

28:34.280 --> 28:38.080
Apparently, your family was
good to him, and you gave him work.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.520
Yeah, only menial jobs, though.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.600
Not for want of trying -
he was always sniffing round.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.840
Sounds like
you're not very fond of him.

28:45.880 --> 28:51.400
Oh, he's desperate to please.
Willing to do anything, volatile.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.400
How?

28:54.440 --> 28:56.280
He'd take things too far.

28:57.800 --> 29:01.560
That famous temper of his.
He'd lose control.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.640
Like he did that night.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.600
What kind of work
did you have him doing?

29:23.160 --> 29:25.360
What the fuck are you up to, duck?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.080
Hmm?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.560
Visiting with him.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.960
Where'd you think
all that's gonna lead ya?

29:34.280 --> 29:36.800
I'm just trying to find out
who Charles Stone is.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.280
He's the man
who killed your daughter.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.000
What more do you need to know?

29:56.160 --> 29:57.560
Come on, I'll see you out.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.720
Lee, go inside, help with your nan.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.200
Go on.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.000
That's my eldest.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.160
Thick as fuck, always has been.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.560
Still, he's one of us.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.600
PINS CLATTER
Nice one. Go on, Jaden.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.640
REMY LAUGHS

30:36.680 --> 30:38.680
Auntie Stella!
Hey.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.800
Hey.
You all right?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.440
Hi, Auntie Stella!
Aw.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.840
Could've made a bit more
of an effort, couldn't ya?

30:43.880 --> 30:45.520
She ain't even got
any reindeer horns on.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.920
Here y'are, gives 'em here.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.560
Oh!
Boys, what'd you reckon?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.000
Ah, she looks like a...
Even More Christmassy!

30:51.040 --> 30:52.920
Like a reindeer.
Ha-ha! Don't she just?

30:52.960 --> 30:54.720
Thank you. Who's winning?

30:54.760 --> 30:56.680
I am!
Good lad.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.440
Jaden looks more like you every day,
don't he?

31:00.480 --> 31:02.400
Yeah, he does, lucky bugger.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.520
THEY LAUGH

31:04.560 --> 31:06.880
Checked in with
the missing persons' team.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.520
They've managed to find CCTV
of Cleo's last sighting.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.800
Right. And?

31:11.840 --> 31:15.360
Well, she got into a red Golf.
All of her own accord.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.800
So, it's someone she knows?

31:17.840 --> 31:19.000
Looks that way.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.360
Can't see the driver, and I couldn't
get a good read of the plates.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.480
What did you find out
about Lee McKeller?

31:25.520 --> 31:29.760
Oh, he's, er, couple of cautions
for possession, but got no record.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.960
He definitely knows her.
He was in her room.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.440
He's gotta have something
to do with it. Maybe.

31:36.600 --> 31:41.200
Maisy's mate told me that she was,
erm, going out with a drug dealer.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.000
Stella...
Listen, I was the one

31:47.040 --> 31:48.760
who identified Charles, yeah?

31:48.800 --> 31:51.080
I wanted him put away
for as long as possible.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.160
The police told me
they'd do everything it took,

31:53.200 --> 31:56.720
it was a high-profile case.
What if they ignored other suspects?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.600
Don't tell me
that's not a possibility.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.080
What if I've put away
an innocent man?

32:12.560 --> 32:13.960
Charlie.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.400
All right, Roman?

32:16.840 --> 32:18.720
Surprised to see you here.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.720
You haven't left me much choice.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.240
So is that why
you've put your Karl in here?

32:24.280 --> 32:25.920
He won't be here much longer.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.600
My family has a reputation.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.840
We don't like to be linked
to a child killer.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.440
So whatever game you're playing,
you'd better stop.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.720
I'm not the one
playing games, Roman.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.520
Sorry to hear about your dad.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.320
Your Teddy's
got no-one out there now.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.080
No-one looking out for him.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.680
This has got nothing to do
with my boy.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.440
You know that's not how this works.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.120
Roman, please.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.240
Don't make me do this.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.640
Oh, Charlie.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.240
Oi.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.880
Come here.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.880
Oi, leave him alone.
You what?

34:05.440 --> 34:06.720
Put it back.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.160
I'm not asking ya.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.160
I'm fucking telling ya,
put it back.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.560
You didn't have to do that.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.720
I'm not gonna watch people
bully you, am I?

35:01.040 --> 35:03.200
Listen, Jamal, about before...

35:03.240 --> 35:05.800
I shouldn't have done it, all right?
I'm sorry.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.800
It's just sometimes, my...

35:09.840 --> 35:11.760
You know?

35:11.800 --> 35:13.280
Come here.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.360
I'm sorry.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.200
All right? I'm sorry.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.960
MAN: Stone.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.840
Permission's been granted
for your dad's funeral.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.520
Let's go.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.040
Can I come in?

35:50.080 --> 35:51.960
I'm just heading out.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.520
Are you off out on a shift?

35:53.560 --> 35:54.880
Yeah.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.640
I just wanted to let you know
I've finished things with Kelvin.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.600
If I'd had known...
what he was allowing to carry on,

36:05.640 --> 36:08.880
with me taking our Maisy there,
I'd... I know. Mum, I know.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.520
I didn't have a clue either.

36:13.720 --> 36:17.000
She kept all these secrets.
A boyfriend.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.800
I mean, did you know about that?

36:22.400 --> 36:25.280
I thought we were closer than that.
Turns out she told me nothing.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.360
You kept plenty from me
when you was younger.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.240
It's normal.
Everyone goes through it.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.200
It's part and parcel of growing up.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.640
Stuff you and Remy
was getting up to, thick as thieves,

36:39.680 --> 36:41.160
I can only imagine.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.840
Yeah, but what she was getting up to
was more than growing up mum.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.960
Me and Paul let her down.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.520
Don't be daft.
You were brilliant parents.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.400
No. I should've ended things
when I knew it weren't right.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.760
Can't have been easy,
living in that house with us.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.000
You were just doing
what you thought were best.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.040
You wanted to give her
what you didn't have.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.680
A bit of stability.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.680
You haven't made
many of my mistakes, love.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.840
No, but I made plenty of my own,
didn't I?

37:21.720 --> 37:26.160
Look, what I said the other day,
that weren't fair, I'm sorry.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.760
It was, though.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.960
I've always had rotten taste
in blokes.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.400
Kelvin made you happy, though.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.040
Yeah.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.760
Thought I got a good one
this time round.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.160
Come here.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.160
My world.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.760
You're doing all right, duckie.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.600
BELL TOLLS

38:15.600 --> 38:18.480
TEDDY: 'My grandad
lived a simple life.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.800
'That doesn't mean
that it weren't a special one.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.320
'He was a decent, hardworking man...

38:29.120 --> 38:32.360
'..working long hours
to provide for his family.'

38:33.760 --> 38:36.000
These days, that's pretty rare.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.920
And to me, that's a hero.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.920
We didn't see him
as much as we'd liked...

38:47.120 --> 38:48.840
..but these past few years,

38:48.880 --> 38:52.040
I really don't know
what I'd done without him.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.800
I'll miss him every day.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.200
We all will.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.680
Cos he was the very best of us.

39:25.160 --> 39:28.880
A few moments with my son? Please.
OK, we'll give you a few minutes.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.360
Come here.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.800
All right? Come here.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.800
That was beautiful, all right?

39:33.840 --> 39:36.280
It was beautiful.
He'd have loved that, hm?

39:36.320 --> 39:38.280
You'd have done him proud.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.960
I'm proud of ya.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.960
I need you to listen to me
very carefully, right?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.440
You do exactly what I tell you.
Do hear me? Yeah.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.200
You hear me?
Yeah.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.000
You gotta leave.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.440
What?
You gotta get out of Millfields.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.200
You and Grace, you gotta go home,
pack up and get out tonight.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.840
It's not safe for you no more.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.320
This is the McKellers, ain't it?

40:04.520 --> 40:06.720
This is what you've been doing
with Stella.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.360
Teddy, it's complicated.
We can't just leave.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.600
We got jobs, friends,
Grace's family.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.040
Dad, I've never left Nottingham.
I know.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.680
But you're gonna have to now.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.400
Just for a bit. Just lay low.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.800
Dad, you promised me.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.160
You promised me
that you'd handle it,

40:24.200 --> 40:25.680
that you'd keep control.
I am doing.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.640
You're not. Not if this is
what it comes to, Dad.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.880
Listen, all I've ever done
is try to protect you.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.640
So do that now.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.320
Stop.

40:33.360 --> 40:36.240
Dad, please, just stop.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.000
Please.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.360
I'm sorry, son, I can't.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.760
I can't.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.000
Dad, what's gonna happen to you?

40:57.240 --> 40:59.440
Teddy... Teddy...

41:00.880 --> 41:03.720
Son? Teddy!

42:19.440 --> 42:21.080
'Ey up, Lee.

42:22.520 --> 42:24.160
You've been following me.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.640
Look, I need to talk to you.

42:28.680 --> 42:32.560
You know I lost my little girl,
everyone does,

42:32.600 --> 42:35.840
but, erm, her mate's missing now,

42:35.880 --> 42:38.280
and I can't just let it go.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.400
You know Cleo, don't you?

42:40.440 --> 42:43.080
Look, I've lived on this estate
my whole life.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.840
All right?
I know everyone, and they know me.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.640
Yeah, I get that.
So what were you doing in her room?

42:48.680 --> 42:49.920
There you go.

42:52.160 --> 42:55.160
Did you know Maisy?
Ask a shit ton of questions, you do.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.800
You gave 'em drugs, didn't ya?

42:56.840 --> 42:59.560
Who the fuck do you think you are?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.880
You know, you lot are all same.

43:04.920 --> 43:08.080
You act like we're scum for selling,
but you're the fuckers buying.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.400
If you're giving 'em to little kids,
you are scum.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.400
Misty wasn't a little kid.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.840
CAR ALARM BEEPS

44:08.280 --> 44:09.960
How'd it go, then, Charlie?

44:11.520 --> 44:12.760
Huh?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.880
Yeah, all right.
Yeah?

44:30.400 --> 44:32.320
You kept your mouth shut, yeah?

44:37.320 --> 44:39.440
You didn't speak to anyone, did ya?

44:50.160 --> 44:53.280
I know you wouldn't.
Cos you know you're done if you do.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.080
Huh?

45:02.280 --> 45:04.400
You're fucking dead, Charlie!

45:08.120 --> 45:09.680
CLICK

45:11.440 --> 45:13.280
Argh!

45:21.120 --> 45:22.480
SHE SIGHS

45:26.040 --> 45:27.600
Charles, it's me.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.520
I think I know who took her.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.400
