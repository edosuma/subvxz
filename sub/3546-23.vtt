00:00.701 --> 00:02.109
Previously on...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.116
She packed up the kids
and the puppy and left.

00:04.140 --> 00:05.152
Packed 'em up? Why?

00:05.176 --> 00:08.015
She followed you
to Atlantic city.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.217
She knows about your other
woman. Things went from bad...

00:10.241 --> 00:12.719
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

00:12.743 --> 00:15.067
To considerably worse.
Oh, man, she's good.

00:15.091 --> 00:17.064
Looks like the insemination
was successful.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.396
Ohh!
And even the good news...

00:19.420 --> 00:21.168
She's the priority now.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.170
She's the mother of my
child. Came with a catch.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.641
Given any thought
to staying at my place?

00:24.665 --> 00:26.203
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.705
You know, I'm stronger than
people give me credit for.

00:28.729 --> 00:32.539
But sometimes once
you accept the truth... Aah!

00:32.563 --> 00:34.720
You discover that you're
capable... Let's just get out of here.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.213
Of accomplishing...

00:36.237 --> 00:39.116
I'd like to admit myself
for psychiatric observation.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.618
I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.151
Almost anything.

00:44.175 --> 00:49.056
It's a fact
of life in every neighborhood...

00:49.080 --> 00:52.199
People move in
and people move out.

00:52.223 --> 00:55.202
Although very few of them
pack up and leave

00:55.226 --> 00:57.804
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:57.828 --> 01:00.437
But it wasn't the first time

01:00.461 --> 01:03.140
that Betty applewhite
had tried to leave

01:03.164 --> 01:05.141
in the middle of the night.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.115
It had happened once before...

01:08.139 --> 01:10.177
In Chicago...

01:10.201 --> 01:12.219
The same night one of her sons

01:12.243 --> 01:16.123
tried to break up
with his girlfriend...

01:16.147 --> 01:19.156
A young woman
named Melanie foster.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.359
Are you kidding?
You cannot dump me.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.361
I do not get dumped.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.233
If anyone is getting
dumped here, it's you.

01:26.257 --> 01:28.195
However you wanna spin it
is fine, okay?

01:28.219 --> 01:30.237
I just want out.
I just want out!

01:30.261 --> 01:32.639
Okay, Matthew.

01:32.663 --> 01:35.750
Maybe I am a bitch sometimes,
but there are advantages

01:35.774 --> 01:38.074
to dating someone like me,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.577
and I know that you know
what I'm talking about. You...

01:40.601 --> 01:43.150
Melanie, my mother is
in the other room.

01:43.174 --> 01:44.451
Are you crazy?

01:44.475 --> 01:50.187
Clearly, we can't have
a serious discussion here.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.119
Why don't you met me
at the lumberyard at 9:00?

01:52.143 --> 01:53.620
Melanie... Huh?

01:53.644 --> 01:54.721
It's over.

01:54.745 --> 01:57.594
Well, even more reason
for you to show up.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.797
No one can say good-bye
better than I do.

02:24.415 --> 02:29.256
Oh, it's about time.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.329
Caleb? What are you doing here?

02:32.353 --> 02:33.360
Where's Matthew?

02:33.384 --> 02:36.603
I got here first.
I-I know a shortcut.

02:36.627 --> 02:38.765
Does Matthew know
that you're here?

02:38.789 --> 02:41.438
No.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.140
He... he doesn't wanna
be with you anymore.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.551
What does that
have to do with you?

02:46.575 --> 02:48.267
See, I thought...

02:49.940 --> 02:52.679
Maybe... I could be
your boyfriend now.

02:52.703 --> 02:54.353
What?

02:55.806 --> 02:57.284
I love you.

02:57.308 --> 03:01.658
Oh, god, please tell me someone
put you up to this. No?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.331
'Cause if you're serious,

03:04.355 --> 03:08.295
it's too pathetic.

03:08.319 --> 03:10.959
God, what the hell
are you doing?!

03:13.364 --> 03:16.673
Get off of me, you freak!

03:28.609 --> 03:30.709
Melanie?

04:03.274 --> 04:05.252
Yes, a year had come and gone

04:05.276 --> 04:08.325
since the applewhites
had left Chicago,

04:08.349 --> 04:11.328
and Betty thought
they could again slip away

04:11.352 --> 04:13.600
in the middle of the night.

04:13.624 --> 04:17.664
Once we move, how is
Matty gon' find us?

04:17.688 --> 04:20.666
Caleb, I think it's just
gonna be you and me

04:20.690 --> 04:22.369
from now on.

04:25.396 --> 04:28.775
Stop! Let me see your hands!
Put your hands up!

04:28.799 --> 04:32.379
But as she soon discovered,

04:32.403 --> 04:35.952
it's not that easy
to slip away in the suburbs,

04:35.976 --> 04:38.625
because in suburbia,

04:38.649 --> 04:41.358
once the neighbors
hear you're going,

04:41.382 --> 04:45.492
they all insist on showing up...

04:45.516 --> 04:48.816
To say good-bye.

♪♪♪

05:36.537 --> 05:40.387
Everyone must choose the road
they will take in life,

05:40.411 --> 05:42.389
and for a special few,

05:42.413 --> 05:46.092
that road would lead
to Wisteria Lane.

05:46.116 --> 05:51.358
They all arrive
the exact same way...

05:51.382 --> 05:55.432
Driving up
in their overloaded trucks...

05:55.456 --> 05:58.505
Bringing with them
their expensive antiques

05:58.529 --> 06:01.059
and ordinary dreams.

06:03.794 --> 06:08.515
I remember the first moment
I saw each of them.

06:08.539 --> 06:13.380
I met Susan Mayer the day
she moved to Wisteria Lane.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.882
Ah! Okay, break time's over.

06:15.906 --> 06:18.455

so delightfully confident,

I couldn't help
but feel intimidated.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.430
Ohh!

Oh, no!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.663
Ohh! Ohh!

Oh, what am I saying? She's 2.

Okay, I need you
to unbuckle yourself

06:42.402 --> 06:46.483

You're not gonna walk me
into a wall, are you?

Of course not, but when
you see it for the first time,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.853
I want you to get
the whole impact.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.877

Besides, it's gonna be fun.

I don't do drugs.

book proposals in the works.

to be proud of me.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.692
Fine.
Let's take a look inside.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.193
Ohh! That's my girl.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.628
So... is there anything
you should prepare me for?

08:41.652 --> 08:44.030
No! No. It's all good.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.202
Oh! But you should know

08:46.226 --> 08:48.174
that your bed doubles
as the dining table,

08:48.198 --> 08:50.198
and the toilet's in the shower.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.240
Honey, look. I bought us
matching golf outfits

08:54.264 --> 08:56.012
for our lessons tomorrow.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.513
Yeah, about that... I can't go.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.515
I gotta pick up trash
on the freeway.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.047
I'm sorry?

09:01.071 --> 09:02.619
I have to do
my community service.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.626
It's part of my parole,
remember?

09:04.650 --> 09:06.893
Oh, okay, well, I'll just
call the country club

09:06.917 --> 09:08.895
and cancel our lessons.
No, no, no.

09:08.919 --> 09:11.758
I mean, I paid already.
Might as well go without me.

09:11.782 --> 09:14.636
I don't wanna go alone. It was
your idea in the first place.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.633
And I'd love to be there
with you, too,

slushies and condoms

Look, what's the big deal?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.538
Just go take the stupid lesson.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.016
Fine, if you feel that way about it. Hey,
I'm sorry.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.243
All right? I'm just
a little on edge today.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.716
Oh, would you look at this crap?

09:29.740 --> 09:31.740
He has been doing that all day.

09:36.607 --> 09:39.085
Ralph has a little crush. So?

09:39.109 --> 09:41.087
So can't I get a gardener

09:41.111 --> 09:43.590
who isn't trying to sleep
with someone in my house?

09:43.614 --> 09:47.264
You pay 6 bucks an hour.
It's all about the perks, honey.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.642
Susan,
have you talked to Lynette?

09:55.666 --> 09:58.144
Uh, no. Have you tried her cell?

09:58.168 --> 10:00.977
Yeah, she isn't picking up.
Do you know where she is?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.309
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.112
Susan, I think you do.

10:06.136 --> 10:08.955
I really don't, Tom.

10:08.979 --> 10:10.657
Is everything okay?

10:10.681 --> 10:12.218
Yeah. Yeah, we just had a fight.

10:12.242 --> 10:14.721
Listen, if you talk to her,

10:14.745 --> 10:17.764
will you please ask her
to call me?

10:17.788 --> 10:20.648
Thank you.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.737
Hello?

10:30.761 --> 10:33.379
He was just here.

10:33.403 --> 10:35.381
I think you should call him.

10:35.405 --> 10:40.346
I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry. I just can't.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.088
Mom! Yeah. Hang on.

10:42.112 --> 10:44.891
I'll call you later. Okay. Bye.

10:44.915 --> 10:46.192
Yeah?

10:46.216 --> 10:49.055
When is daddy coming?
I wanna show him my dive.

10:49.079 --> 10:52.349
He's not coming, sweetheart.

10:54.084 --> 10:56.834
But you could showme.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.414
You have to talk to Noah.

11:08.438 --> 11:10.977
But he creeps me out. Who cares?

11:11.001 --> 11:12.679
This is my life
we're talking about.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.726
I need a big-time lawyer
in my corner,

11:14.750 --> 11:17.023
and where else are we gonna
get that kind of money?

11:17.047 --> 11:19.956
Noah's not gonna give me a dime
if he knows it's for you.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.958
He hates your guts.
Tell him it's for you.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.659
Tell him you want a car.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.197
Tell him you're ready for him
to buy your love. Trust me.

11:26.221 --> 11:28.434
Dying men are nothing
if not sentimental.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.436
Why do you need so much, anyway?

11:30.460 --> 11:33.940
I thought only guilty men
needed expensive lawyers.

11:33.964 --> 11:36.748
Felicia has obviously been
planning this for months.

11:36.772 --> 11:39.846
Who knows what other kind
of evidence she's planted?

11:39.870 --> 11:42.448
With my luck, they'll open up
the Martha Huber murder again,

11:42.472 --> 11:44.450
try to nail me with some d.N.A.

11:44.474 --> 11:48.785
You swore to me that you had
nothing to do with that.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.857
I didn't.

11:50.881 --> 11:53.289
Look, why are we arguing?

11:53.313 --> 11:56.723
I'm your father.
Do what I'm telling you to do.

11:56.747 --> 12:00.827
You're not my real father.

12:00.851 --> 12:04.030
You ungrateful little...

12:04.054 --> 12:06.377
I rescue you
from that miserable junkie.

12:06.401 --> 12:08.374
I give you a home,
a life worth living,

12:08.398 --> 12:12.098
and now you're making me beg
for one lousy little favor?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.912
I need the money, Zach.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.914
If you won't do it for me,

12:17.938 --> 12:20.108
at least do it for your mother.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.782
After all, she killed herself
trying to protect you.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.372
I met Bree Van De Kamp

12:46.396 --> 12:49.375
the first day she moved
to Wisteria Lane.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.878
There are certain people,
who, when you meet them,

12:51.902 --> 12:55.321
can't help but make
a delightful first impression.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.924
Hello. I'm Bree Van De Kamp,
your new neighbor.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.425
Is this your frog?

12:59.449 --> 13:01.858
Bree was not one of them.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.189
Yes. Why?

13:03.213 --> 13:07.533
Well, it seems that my son
stole it from your yard.

13:07.557 --> 13:09.265
Oh, well, I don't mind.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.767
If he likes it so much,
he's welcome to keep it.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.769
Well, don't tell him that.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.280
If he doesn't feel guilty,
he'll never learn shame.

13:16.304 --> 13:18.244
Hey, what's going on?

13:18.268 --> 13:20.847
Oh. Um, this is
our new neighbor.

13:20.871 --> 13:23.349
It seems her son accidentally
took my garden frog.

13:23.373 --> 13:24.951
Oh.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.953
Please don't make excuses
for him.

13:26.977 --> 13:29.977
That is exactly what
his father does. Rex!

13:34.284 --> 13:36.062
This is my husband Rex.

13:36.086 --> 13:39.065
Hi. We're not weird.
We just seem like we are.

13:39.089 --> 13:42.198
And this is my son...

13:42.222 --> 13:43.422
The criminal.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.055
Go on.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.405
I'm sorry I stole from you.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.979
Just so you know, my mom
did teach me right from wrong,

13:53.003 --> 13:54.920
so my actions should in no way

13:54.944 --> 13:58.235
influence your opinion
of her as a parent.

14:00.971 --> 14:04.490
Wow. Well, is there anything
you'd like to say to my son?

14:04.514 --> 14:06.584
Feel free to be harsh.

14:07.918 --> 14:11.497
No, I'm... I'm good.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.400
Well, now that we've finished
with all this unpleasantness,

14:14.424 --> 14:16.402
I want to assure you

14:16.426 --> 14:18.404
that we are going to be
good neighbors,

14:18.428 --> 14:21.307
and I hope in time,
great friends.

14:21.331 --> 14:23.991
That sounds... lovely.

14:25.395 --> 14:26.873
Come on.

14:26.897 --> 14:28.875
Oh, wait. I'm... I'm sorry.

14:28.899 --> 14:32.078
It was Rex, Andrew and...
What was your name again?

14:32.102 --> 14:35.521
Bree?

14:35.545 --> 14:36.582
What?

14:36.606 --> 14:38.584
You're Bree Van De Kamp, right?

14:38.608 --> 14:40.086
Do I know you?

14:40.110 --> 14:43.589
Orson hodge.
Uh, Susan's dentist friend.

14:43.613 --> 14:45.600
We met after her house
burned down.

14:45.624 --> 14:48.965
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.937
Small world, huh?

14:50.961 --> 14:53.900
Yes. Uh, excruciatingly so.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.041
Ah.

14:55.065 --> 14:57.173
What are you doing here?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.897
Well, three or four times
a week, I visit my... my friend.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.609
What about you?

15:03.633 --> 15:06.652
Oh, I just thought it'd be
a lovely place

15:06.676 --> 15:08.614
to take a nice, long rest.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.256
Ah.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.517
Um, listen,

15:11.541 --> 15:14.660
I told my friends that
I was, um, I was at a spa,

15:14.684 --> 15:17.431
so if you run into Susan,
I... your secret is safe.

15:17.455 --> 15:18.624
And seriously...

15:18.648 --> 15:21.427
I am not
like these other people.

15:21.451 --> 15:24.100
Oh, I can tell.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.111
A real lady always
stands out in a crowd.

15:26.135 --> 15:29.505
Well, that was... Very sweet.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.429
Enjoy your rest,
Bree Van De Kamp.

15:40.010 --> 15:43.089
Boy, do I feel for you.

15:43.113 --> 15:46.027
Trying to convince your friends
that you're still normal,

15:46.051 --> 15:48.024
and you're surrounded
by a bunch of loons.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.395
You, too?

15:49.419 --> 15:51.327
Oh, please.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.300
Dr. Barr goes out of his way
to make me feel

15:54.324 --> 15:56.007
like a complete psychopath.

15:56.031 --> 15:58.686
I think he's crazier
than the patients, actually.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.440
You know that, um,
that woman in the wheelchair?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.248
What's her story?
Yeah, she's a kooky one.

16:07.272 --> 16:09.245
She hasn't spoken a word
since she got here.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.946
She just sits there all day long

16:10.970 --> 16:12.948
waiting for your friend
to come and visit.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.121
He talks to her for hours,

16:15.145 --> 16:17.645
but I don't even think
she can hear him.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.165
Oh, hi.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.338
You said to stop by
for coffee sometime.

16:32.362 --> 16:35.401
I got coffee.

16:35.425 --> 16:38.574
So I can't believe
you caught me spraying for ants.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.576
I must look like a wreck.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.578
Actually, you look kinda sexy.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.110
You've gotta be kidding.

16:44.134 --> 16:46.687
Oh, the way you're taking
charge... it's impressive.

16:46.711 --> 16:49.085
They're just ants,
and they're tiny.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.087
Of course, they do outnumber me.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.589
Oh, you said you wanted
to handle things yourself,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.100
and you're making it happen.
It's good to see.

16:56.124 --> 16:58.564
Thanks.

16:58.588 --> 17:00.566
Even if it does mean

17:00.590 --> 17:03.369
you're not in the market
for a relationship right now.

17:03.393 --> 17:06.031
Oh. Did I say that?

17:06.056 --> 17:08.674
You certainly implied it.

17:08.698 --> 17:12.208
Well, sometimes I say things
I don't mean.

17:12.232 --> 17:17.012
I blame it on my frequent
exposure to ant spray.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.185
What the hell is this?

17:19.209 --> 17:22.088
Karl. What do you want?

17:22.112 --> 17:24.220
Well, I can't believe
you're forcing our daughter

17:24.243 --> 17:26.227
to live in a house with wheels.

17:26.251 --> 17:28.223
I think we need
to talk about this.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.325
Okay, it's temporary,

17:29.349 --> 17:32.027
and if you don't mind,
I'm having coffee.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.759
Oh, it's okay, Susan.

17:33.783 --> 17:37.037
Hey, sorry. I don't mean
to chase you out, buddy,

17:37.061 --> 17:39.435
but, uh, this is really
a family thing.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.467
No, no, I understand.

17:41.491 --> 17:42.761
Cool.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.765
Mmm.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.171
I'll call you later.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.287
You've got a great swing.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.789
You just need a little help
around the Greens.

18:03.813 --> 18:05.791
You know what they say...

18:05.815 --> 18:08.294
Drive for show,
putt for dough. Am I right?

18:08.318 --> 18:10.296
That is so true.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.268
All right. I'll see
you out there. Okay.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.500
Make me something strong.

18:14.524 --> 18:17.103
I have nine more holes
with that guy.

18:17.127 --> 18:20.075
Jim, it was just an hour ago
that the road crew

18:20.099 --> 18:22.108
working here on route 57

18:22.132 --> 18:25.256
saw a member of their own
killed by oncoming traffic.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.254
The victim was a hispanic male
in his early 40s

18:28.278 --> 18:31.257
who, for years, was a prominent
businessman in the area.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.259
Police aren't releasing a name

18:33.283 --> 18:35.321
until the next of kin
can be notified.

18:35.345 --> 18:37.323
We, of course,
will keep you updated...

18:37.347 --> 18:39.325
On any late-breaking
developments

18:39.349 --> 18:40.826
as this tragic story unfolds.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.329
Reporting live from route 57,
this is Craig tsuyumine.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.863
Back to you.

18:59.909 --> 19:04.239
Mrs. Solis! Why you home?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.494
Carlos is dead, xiao-Mei.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.596
No, please don't kill him.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.459
No, you don't understand.
He's already dead.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.201
There was an accident.

19:15.225 --> 19:18.334
He's all over the highway.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.436
No...

19:20.460 --> 19:22.490
He in kitchen.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.779
Hey, babe.
Why you home so early?

19:33.803 --> 19:37.152
Oh, honey! Oh, you're not dead!

19:37.176 --> 19:39.185
Who said I was dead?

19:39.209 --> 19:42.458
The police. They called me.
What are you talking about?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.460
Honey, they didn't know
all the details,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.467
but a witness said
that they saw you

19:46.491 --> 19:49.465
run into the carpool Lane
to pick up a lawn chair

19:49.489 --> 19:51.166
that had fallen off some truck,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.699
and then a bus hit you
right in front of the road crew.

19:53.723 --> 19:57.680
Why aren't you at the road crew?
I paid Ralph to go in my place.

19:57.704 --> 19:59.345
What?

19:59.369 --> 20:02.208
Well, Carlos,
they had your name.

20:02.232 --> 20:05.281
Oh, no. Poor Ralph.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.812
Oh!

20:06.836 --> 20:08.814
Why is your back all sweaty?

20:08.838 --> 20:11.257
I was working out
on the treadmill.

20:11.281 --> 20:13.188
Barefoot?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.496
For god sakes,
Gabrielle, Ralph just died,

20:15.520 --> 20:17.493
and you're worried
about my feet?

20:17.517 --> 20:21.367
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with you?

20:21.391 --> 20:24.391
My fault. Sorry.

20:38.268 --> 20:40.215
You must find that
very peaceful.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.248
Why would you assume that?

20:42.272 --> 20:45.256
Because that's all you've been
doing for three sessions.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.353
I still don't know
anything about you,

20:47.377 --> 20:50.426
except that you rake
in remarkably straight lines.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.428
Is that what you're doing,

20:52.452 --> 20:54.430
asking me all those
ridiculous questions

20:54.454 --> 20:56.937
about my childhood,
trying to get to know me?

20:56.961 --> 20:58.904
Well, here's a clue.
I'm not crazy.

20:58.928 --> 21:02.438
I just have a few issues. And psychotherapy
is how we help you deal with those issues.

21:02.462 --> 21:06.416
What kind of treatment did you think you
were going to get? Honestly, I was hoping

21:06.440 --> 21:08.374
that you'd medicate
the hell out of me.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.416
You don't need anything stronger

21:10.440 --> 21:12.418
than what I've already
prescribed for you.

21:12.442 --> 21:15.326
I have aspirin at home
that packs more of a punch.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.323
It says here your husband died,

21:17.347 --> 21:19.325
you had a boyfriend
who killed himself,

21:19.349 --> 21:22.358
and you suffer from alcoholism.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.861
That's a lot of trauma
for one year.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.564
What about your kids?

21:28.588 --> 21:31.897
Oh, they're fine.

21:31.921 --> 21:34.269
Andrew is backpacking
through Europe,

21:34.293 --> 21:37.573
and Danielle is away
at cheerleading camp.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.427
What's your relationship
with them like?

21:41.671 --> 21:43.349
What do you mean?

21:43.373 --> 21:44.650
Are you close?

21:44.674 --> 21:47.453
Do they share things with you?

21:47.477 --> 21:49.537
What do you feel about them?

21:52.041 --> 21:55.060
You know, I really don't
have time for this nonsense.

21:55.084 --> 21:58.071
Are you going to give me
some serious drugs or not?

21:58.095 --> 22:00.466
No.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.368
Fine. Then I'm going back
to my room.

22:02.392 --> 22:04.730
You know, Bree, I can't
force you to open up to me,

22:04.754 --> 22:08.338
but I can make it easier for
you to focus on your problems.

22:08.362 --> 22:10.376
And how are you
going to do that?

22:10.400 --> 22:12.438
I'm going to tell the orderlies

22:12.462 --> 22:14.440
to confiscate
all your personal items.

22:14.464 --> 22:16.447
I committed myself voluntarily.

22:16.471 --> 22:18.444
When you signed those papers,

22:18.468 --> 22:20.646
I became responsible
for your well-being,

22:20.670 --> 22:24.620
and I will help you in any way I
see fit. I don't need that much help,

22:24.644 --> 22:27.361
because I am not like your
other patients. Oh, sure, you are.

22:27.385 --> 22:29.377
You just don't know it yet.

22:41.831 --> 22:44.940
Your son confessed to murder.
We've got it on tape.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.913
My son has the mind
of a child, detective.

22:47.937 --> 22:50.067
He'd confess to sinking
the "Titanic."

22:52.742 --> 22:54.720
This letter was sent
some months ago

22:54.744 --> 22:58.058
to the Chicago police,
saying the person they arrested

22:58.082 --> 23:00.355
for the Melanie foster murder
was innocent.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.627
We have a hunch you wrote it.

23:01.651 --> 23:04.660
Really? I didn't know hunches
were considered evidence

23:04.684 --> 23:06.361
in a court of law.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.415
They aren't.

23:11.721 --> 23:14.440
But this is.

23:14.464 --> 23:16.751
We found some of
the assailant's d.N.A.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.574
On this jacket.

23:18.598 --> 23:22.548
Now all we need
is a matching sample.

23:22.572 --> 23:25.782
You, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.715
It's not Caleb's.

23:29.739 --> 23:34.389
You can try and deny it, but...

23:34.413 --> 23:36.722
No.

23:36.746 --> 23:38.586
You don't understand.

23:41.451 --> 23:44.451
That jacket belongs
to my other son.

24:09.018 --> 24:12.928
And out of nowhere,
he just attacked me.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.100
My brother's never been violent.

24:15.124 --> 24:17.603
I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt you.

24:17.627 --> 24:20.057
But he did.

24:22.131 --> 24:24.491
Let me just take you home.

24:29.098 --> 24:31.577
This has been
pretty traumatic for me.

24:31.601 --> 24:34.580
I-I-I think that you should
come over for the next few days

24:34.604 --> 24:36.582
so we can talk it out.

24:36.606 --> 24:39.646
We broke up, Mel. It is not
my job to hold your hand.

24:41.811 --> 24:44.551
Well, maybe I shouldn't
go home right away.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.694
Maybe I should go
to the cops first.

24:48.718 --> 24:49.935
The cops?

24:49.959 --> 24:51.867
I was attacked.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.870
It's my civic duty to report it,
don't you think?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.872
Mel, I just told you

24:56.896 --> 24:59.945
that Caleb did not mean
to do what he did, okay?

24:59.969 --> 25:01.647
Melanie, please. Screw you.

25:01.671 --> 25:03.849
No, you cannot tell anybody
about this!

25:03.873 --> 25:07.587
I can tell who I want! Get your hands off
of me! We're talking about my brother here!

25:07.611 --> 25:10.586
Your brother is going to go
to jail for the next ten years,

25:10.610 --> 25:13.140
so I say let go!

25:15.885 --> 25:17.192
Hey, Melanie!

25:17.216 --> 25:18.493
What?!

25:18.517 --> 25:19.595
Uhh!

25:19.619 --> 25:23.649
You leave my family alone! Uhh!

26:05.674 --> 26:07.643
We all met Lynette Scavo

26:07.667 --> 26:09.645
the day
she moved onto Wisteria Lane.

26:09.669 --> 26:13.178
We quickly decided
she would be our friend,

26:13.202 --> 26:17.282
mostly because we were
afraid to have her as an enemy.

26:17.306 --> 26:20.976
Playing Russian roulette with
my ovaries and... take a pill, Lynette!

26:23.152 --> 26:24.590
Hi. Hi.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.597
Hi. Uh, we just wanted to come

26:26.621 --> 26:28.594
welcome you to the neighborhood.

26:28.618 --> 26:32.097
Um,
but we could come back later. Yeah.

26:32.121 --> 26:34.640
No, wait. Actually, wait.
This is perfect.

26:34.664 --> 26:37.011
You know why? Because we need
some impartial judges. Lynette...

26:37.035 --> 26:39.705
Let's suppose your husband
begged you to get pregnant...

26:39.729 --> 26:41.647
Begged you... and out
of the goodness of your heart,

26:41.671 --> 26:44.049
you agreed, even though
it might derail your career.

26:44.073 --> 26:46.056
You agreed to a baby.
Ababy, singular.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.013
Lynette, we've just met
these people.

26:48.037 --> 26:50.255
Then... then you go in
for an ultrasound,

26:50.279 --> 26:52.257
and you hear two heartbeats.

26:52.281 --> 26:54.760
Then and only then does
your husband tell you

26:54.784 --> 26:56.762
that twins run in his family.

26:56.786 --> 26:58.924
I didn't think
it was that big a deal!

26:58.948 --> 27:00.926
Your family had
eight sets of twins

27:00.950 --> 27:02.628
over three generations,

27:02.652 --> 27:04.599
not to mention your relatives
in Kentucky with triplets!

27:04.623 --> 27:06.702
Triplets! So I ask you,

27:06.726 --> 27:10.105
do I not deserve to punish
this man severely?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.606
Well, actually, I think

27:11.630 --> 27:15.380
that twins are genetically
determined by the mother.

27:15.404 --> 27:17.612
What are you, a scientist?

27:17.636 --> 27:21.046
No. No,
I write children's books.

27:21.070 --> 27:24.249
Um, we, uh, just came over
to introduce ourselves,

27:24.273 --> 27:27.653
but we can, um,
do that at another time.

27:27.677 --> 27:29.254
No, wait. Please stay.
It's okay.

27:29.278 --> 27:31.256
We're okay. We're okay, right?

27:31.280 --> 27:35.030
Honey, we don't wanna
freak out the new neighbors.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.703
I'm sorry that you saw
my panic attack.

27:37.727 --> 27:40.165
I won't let it happen again,

27:40.189 --> 27:42.668
especially since this is
my last pregnancy.

27:42.692 --> 27:46.111
Right. You're the boss.
I'm just your love slave.

27:46.135 --> 27:48.173
Aw.

27:48.197 --> 27:49.675
Well, don't encourage him.

27:49.699 --> 27:52.177
Honey, clearly,
our new neighbors can sense

27:52.201 --> 27:56.852
that you have been gifted
with a phenomenal husband.

27:58.107 --> 28:00.025
Cannonball!

28:00.049 --> 28:01.326
Guys?

28:01.350 --> 28:03.358
Could you come here
for a second?

28:03.382 --> 28:06.022
We need to have a serious talk.

28:09.759 --> 28:14.840
Okay, we have had
a great... vacation,

28:14.864 --> 28:17.202
but tomorrow we're going home.

28:17.226 --> 28:22.007
Except we're not going
toourhome.

28:22.031 --> 28:25.010
We're gonna go stay
with grandma.

28:25.034 --> 28:28.153
Is dad gonna be there?

28:28.177 --> 28:30.155
No, dad is not gonna be there,

28:30.179 --> 28:34.920
but he... he is gonna come
and see you guys all the time.

28:34.944 --> 28:38.423
We are still gonna be a family.

28:38.447 --> 28:41.767
It's just...

28:41.791 --> 28:46.701
We won't be living
in the same place anymore.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.335
So...

28:50.359 --> 28:53.199
Is there any questions
you wanna ask me?

28:55.865 --> 28:57.905
Can we go swimming now?

29:01.941 --> 29:03.889
Yeah!

29:03.913 --> 29:05.350
Cannonball!

29:27.466 --> 29:29.174
Mike, what a surprise.

29:29.198 --> 29:32.047
Yeah. How's it goin'?

29:32.071 --> 29:33.919
Good, good. I'm...

29:33.943 --> 29:38.924
Just came in to get
a new battery for my watch.

29:38.948 --> 29:41.787
So... whatcha doin'?

29:41.811 --> 29:43.789
Oh, just buying something
for my grandma.

29:43.813 --> 29:45.290
It's her 90th birthday.

29:45.314 --> 29:46.832
Here we go.

29:46.856 --> 29:48.894
This will sweep her
right off her feet.

29:48.918 --> 29:53.498
It's elegant, and she can
build on it for anniversaries.

29:53.522 --> 29:56.371
Lucky grandma.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.374
You dog. You're gonna ask
Susan to marry you, aren't you?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.877
I didn't say that.
Man, I'm cool.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.810
As far as I'm concerned,
Susan's old news, so...

30:04.834 --> 30:06.151
Mazel tov.

30:06.175 --> 30:08.153
I don't suppose there's any hope

30:08.177 --> 30:10.986
of you keeping your mouth shut
about this, is there?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.989
I wanted to surprise her. Oh,
trust me, brother. She'll be surprised,

30:14.013 --> 30:17.323
and not just
by how small that rock is.

30:23.893 --> 30:25.980
Look, I-I know
it's an expensive car,

30:26.004 --> 30:29.434
but I need one,
so can I get the money?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.409
You're a lousy liar, kid.
I read the papers.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.412
I know what happened
to your father.

30:37.436 --> 30:42.087
My guess is he's in the market
for a fancy lawyer

30:42.111 --> 30:45.520
to get him
some rich man's justice.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.222
Please.

30:47.246 --> 30:51.056
Paul young put Deirdre in a box.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.180
My daughter. Your mother.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.831
So we're clear,

30:56.855 --> 31:00.265
I don't write checks
to monsters.

31:00.289 --> 31:03.268
Why can't you
just give me the money?

31:03.292 --> 31:05.610
You're dying.
You don't need it. I do.

31:05.634 --> 31:08.914
Don't cry, Zach.
It pisses me off.

31:08.938 --> 31:11.846
Well, you said all of this
was gonna be mine,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.949
so when do I get it?!

31:13.973 --> 31:15.960
"Empire" is a highfalutin word,

31:15.984 --> 31:18.453
but that's what I've built.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.855
Unfortunately...

31:20.879 --> 31:26.531
An empire can only be ruled
by an iron fist

31:26.555 --> 31:29.895
and a strong gut.

31:29.919 --> 31:32.998
I wanted to give it to you,
Zach,

31:33.022 --> 31:35.870
but I'm starting to have
my doubts about you.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.905
So what?

31:39.929 --> 31:41.576
Are you cutting me off?

31:41.600 --> 31:45.430
I don't have any use
for weakness.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.006
Get out.

32:32.982 --> 32:35.082
What, are you gonna kill me?

32:36.355 --> 32:39.225
Prove you're a tough guy?

32:42.291 --> 32:44.439
See? That's why I can't give you

32:44.463 --> 32:46.473
the keys to the kingdom, kid.

32:48.697 --> 32:51.167
No balls.

33:33.712 --> 33:38.593
We met Gabrielle solis the day
she moved to Wisteria Lane.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.096
We were all excited
to get a glimpse

33:41.120 --> 33:45.300
of a successful New York model.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.301
Hello?

33:46.325 --> 33:48.103
We saw more...

33:48.127 --> 33:50.135
Hi there.

33:50.159 --> 33:53.159
Than we bargained for.

33:55.164 --> 33:56.511
I'm Mary Alice.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.582
Hi.

33:57.606 --> 34:00.185
This is Susan,
uh, Lynette and Bree.

34:00.209 --> 34:02.016
Welcome to the neighborhood.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.018
Well, I am Gabrielle solis.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.329
Would it be better
if we came back at another time?

34:07.353 --> 34:09.694
Oh! No, no. I was...

34:09.717 --> 34:12.357
Just changing
out of my sweaty clothes.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.030
I didn't realize
moving was such great cardio.

34:16.054 --> 34:20.164
Hey, babe, we haven't tried it
in the kitchen yet.

34:22.291 --> 34:26.040
Honey, uh, I think it's time
to unpack the pants.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.643
Right.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.667
It's nice to meet you ladies.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.280
Let me guess... newlyweds?

34:35.304 --> 34:36.751
Four months,

34:36.775 --> 34:41.054
and I've been dressed like this
for two of 'em.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.149
He's insatiable.

34:54.263 --> 34:56.241
Hey, what are you doing?

34:56.264 --> 34:58.243
Trying to have sex with you.

34:58.267 --> 35:00.327
Now? Babe, it's kind of late.

35:02.271 --> 35:04.249
You don't wanna have sex
with me?

35:04.273 --> 35:06.116
You always wanna have sex
with me.

35:06.140 --> 35:08.113
You wanted to have sex with me

35:08.137 --> 35:10.115
an hour
after your hernia operation.

35:10.139 --> 35:12.557
I'm a little preoccupied.

35:12.581 --> 35:15.290
A good man died today.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.454
Don't take it personally.

35:27.125 --> 35:31.105
Xiao-Mei said
the strangest thing to me.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.107
When I told her you were dead,

35:33.131 --> 35:35.431
she said,
"please don't kill him."

35:38.307 --> 35:40.615
That poor kid.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.769
Oh. We really need to get her
some English lessons.

35:55.384 --> 35:58.233
Julie, what are you doing?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.864
I'm trying to sleep.

35:59.888 --> 36:01.766
Morning, ladies.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.809
Karl! What are you doing?

36:04.833 --> 36:07.820
I've got a little surprise
planned for my girls.

36:07.844 --> 36:11.336
So just sit back and relax.
We'll be there shortly.

36:15.244 --> 36:19.224
No, no, no, no.
No, turn my house around.

36:19.248 --> 36:21.386
Latte?

36:27.316 --> 36:29.316
Out to the right, ladies.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.922
My gift to you.

36:36.665 --> 36:38.343
You bought us a house?

36:38.367 --> 36:40.645
Let's have a look around.
There's three bedrooms,

36:40.669 --> 36:42.647
there's a guest house
in the back

36:42.671 --> 36:45.310
that you could use as a studio.
There's a pool.

36:45.334 --> 36:46.621
A pool? Really? Aah!

36:48.507 --> 36:49.914
What's the catch?

36:49.938 --> 36:52.287
There's no catch.
It's yours, susie.

36:52.311 --> 36:55.189
Yours and Julie's,
no strings attached.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.191
I can't accept this.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.594
I just... I gotta get out
of this mess on my own.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.596
This is not charity.

37:01.620 --> 37:05.199
I owe you...

37:05.223 --> 37:06.901
Consider it payback.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.674
Mom!

37:09.698 --> 37:11.836
There's a poolanda jacuzzi!

37:11.860 --> 37:14.339
At least no one
can drive off with it

37:14.363 --> 37:16.973
while you're sleeping, huh?

37:20.969 --> 37:22.487
Hey, it's Susan.

37:22.511 --> 37:25.490
Just wanted you to know I let
the electrician in your house.

37:25.514 --> 37:28.001
I hope you're having
a great time at the spa.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.855
Bree, hi. It's Betty.

37:30.879 --> 37:33.358
I'm... I'm sorry to leave this
on the machine,

37:33.382 --> 37:35.860
but the police have evidence
that implicates Matthew

37:35.884 --> 37:37.871
in the murder of Melanie foster.

37:37.895 --> 37:39.864
We have to find them, Bree.

37:39.888 --> 37:42.758
We have to find them
and get Danielle back.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.416
You let go of me right now! Hey,
hey!

37:51.440 --> 37:55.380
What's going on here? I am trying to leave,
and these morons won't let me.

37:55.404 --> 37:57.957
Do you know that you can be
arrested for kidnapping,

37:57.981 --> 38:00.685
for detaining someone?!
Why do you need to leave?

38:00.709 --> 38:03.588
Because my daughter is in danger.
Something happened at cheerleading camp.

38:03.612 --> 38:05.590
Okay, there's no camp.
That was a fib on my part.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.871
I found out that she ran away
with a boy,

38:07.895 --> 38:10.595
and the boy is a murderer.
A murderer?

38:10.619 --> 38:13.398
I can tell by your tone
that you don't believe me.

38:13.422 --> 38:16.341
Bree, let's talk about this
in my office.

38:16.365 --> 38:18.403
I don't have time for therapy,
you quack!

38:18.427 --> 38:20.705
Now let me out of here!
Let go of me!

38:20.729 --> 38:22.707
You idiot, let go of me!

38:22.731 --> 38:24.709
You know that I
committed myself voluntarily!

38:24.733 --> 38:27.281
You can't do this to me! No!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.314
Bree, please, don't struggle.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.760
If anything happens
to my daughter,

38:35.784 --> 38:37.462
so help me, god...

38:37.486 --> 38:40.686
We're only trying to help.

39:02.070 --> 39:03.548
What's this now?

39:03.572 --> 39:05.049
I wanna swim.

39:05.073 --> 39:07.560
Well, we already swam.
Now it's time to pack.

39:07.584 --> 39:10.725
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.827
Dad would let me swim.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.829
Well, dad's not here,

39:14.853 --> 39:19.033
so I decide, and I decide no.

39:22.731 --> 39:24.709
Oh, Porter, what are you doing?

39:24.733 --> 39:25.910
Hey!

39:25.934 --> 39:28.518
Hey, get down off that
right now. I mean it!

39:28.542 --> 39:31.376
Okay! Okay, okay, Porter,
just stop, all right?

39:31.400 --> 39:34.449
Just come on inside, and we'll
forget the whole thing.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.721
Aah! Aah! No!

39:45.514 --> 39:46.471
Daddy!

39:46.495 --> 39:47.862
Daddy! Daddy!

39:47.886 --> 39:52.667
Hey, guys. God! Ooh, god,
I've missed you so much.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.421
Oh, you, too, munchkin.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.976
Where's Porter? Is he okay?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.649
He broke his arm.
They took him up to X-ray.

40:04.673 --> 40:08.587
Hey, guys, why don't you look
after your sister for me, okay?

40:08.611 --> 40:10.607
Mommy and daddy need to talk.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.590
I've got nothing to say to you.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.597
I just called because I had to.

40:17.621 --> 40:19.594
Honey, whatever you saw,
I can explain it.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.095
I am not interested,

40:21.119 --> 40:23.097
and if you wanna
keep those fingers,

40:23.121 --> 40:25.621
I would move 'em away
from my body. Thank you.

40:26.955 --> 40:29.434
Lynette,
I am not cheating on you.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.836
I never have, and I never will.

40:31.860 --> 40:34.509
I saw you with that woman.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.517
Her name is Nora. I met her 12
years ago. I don't care what her name is.

40:37.541 --> 40:40.414
I met her before you. She was
a dancer on a cruise ship.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.487
We had a one night stand.

40:42.511 --> 40:45.019
I haven't thought about her in years.
Then why are you going to Atlantic city

40:45.043 --> 40:48.623
every other weekend
to visit her?

40:50.448 --> 40:52.627
I have another child, Lynette.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.560
What?

40:55.584 --> 40:57.537
She got pregnant
from the one night stand.

40:57.561 --> 40:59.934
Nora raised the kid
without ever telling me.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.936
I only just found out about it.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.569
That is why I have been
going back and forth.

41:04.593 --> 41:06.573
I am not having an affair.

41:09.137 --> 41:11.037
Uhh!

41:21.980 --> 41:23.958
The little girl's name is Kayla.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.230
She's 11 years old.

41:26.254 --> 41:29.198
I know I should've told you
about this sooner.

41:29.222 --> 41:32.196
It's just that I wanted to take
a paternity test to be sure,

41:32.220 --> 41:34.520
and I'm definitely the dad.

41:37.666 --> 41:40.645
Why did she wait so long
to contact you?

41:40.669 --> 41:42.947
She said she wanted
to raise the kid alone,

41:42.971 --> 41:47.251
and I... I guess
she's changed her mind, honey.

41:47.275 --> 41:51.485
Baby, I am so sorry.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.487
Not ready for that yet.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.641
Okay.

41:56.284 --> 41:59.854
You have no idea how badly
you scared me.

42:01.690 --> 42:03.167
I am so sorry.

42:03.191 --> 42:05.821
I had already let you go.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.008
Dad! I got a blue cast.

42:14.032 --> 42:17.942
Hey, buddy. You sure did.
That's pretty cool.

42:22.611 --> 42:25.519
Hey.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.623
It itches. Can we go home now?

42:36.585 --> 42:39.203
Yeah. We're going home.
