00:15.000 --> 00:16.995
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:17.000 --> 00:18.999
- You find this job meaningful?
- What?

00:19.020 --> 00:22.340
When I started off, I convinced
myself that this was temporary.

00:22.492 --> 00:25.709
I've been trying to change
Katie's mind about our situation.

00:25.781 --> 00:26.994
Whatever I said six months ago,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.588
I didn't mean that we
would take a break and

00:28.594 --> 00:29.995
everything would go back to how it was.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.995
If I changed my job,
she might take me back.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.455
You'd be at all the awards shows.

00:34.881 --> 00:37.880
You get points on the back end.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.470
What the fuck?

00:39.740 --> 00:40.735
How hard can it be?

00:40.740 --> 00:42.735
Producing a movie. We've got a script.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.735
We don't know the first fucking thing.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.735
So we find someone who does.

00:45.740 --> 00:46.616
Mr. Moreweather,

00:46.736 --> 00:49.228
I'd produce this myself, but
I've never done it before.

00:49.339 --> 00:52.735
So I do the legwork, you advise
me. And we split the profits.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.735
You'd finance one of his movies

00:54.740 --> 00:55.735
as a silent partner.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.735
All of that money would be clean.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.740
I'll think about it.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.735
Hey, it's Miles Daly again.

01:26.740 --> 01:28.735
Calling for Rick Moreweather.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.735
Uh, sorry to leave another message,

01:30.740 --> 01:34.735
but I have some news on the
film script that we discussed.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.735
Um, better I tell you directly.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.735
So if you could give me a
call back, I'd appreciate it.

01:40.740 --> 01:44.735
I'm at 775-127-0432.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.740
All right, thank you.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.735
Ah, look at that, the
reception is shite here.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.735
For all I know he's already called.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.740
I doubt it. Watch the road, okay?

01:57.740 --> 01:59.735
I told Katie I was
starting a new profession,

01:59.740 --> 02:02.740
she thought I meant I was painting
houses or some fucking thing.

02:05.740 --> 02:07.735
She finds out I'm making a movie...

02:07.740 --> 02:09.735
Assuming this producer calls you back.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.735
He'll call.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.739
And I'll tell him I've got financing.
I mean, that's the hardest part that.

02:14.846 --> 02:19.740
Oh, is it, really? The hardest
part, in your experience?

02:36.740 --> 02:39.740
...down the right
side. He's hammered. He had a man.

02:42.740 --> 02:45.740
Get your ass on the ground!

02:52.740 --> 02:53.735
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

02:53.740 --> 02:55.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

02:55.878 --> 02:56.735
Outside.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.740
- All right. All right.
- Let's go.

03:04.740 --> 03:05.740
Go check out that trailer.

03:08.740 --> 03:10.740
Could use some cover.

03:11.740 --> 03:12.740
Or I could just go on my own.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.740
Get him up.

03:21.740 --> 03:25.735
Damn, relax, man.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.735
Oh, gold teeth.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.735
So you're a hard fuckin' OG.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.740
That what that means?

03:33.740 --> 03:35.735
You sell candy around
here, you kick up to Amara.

03:35.740 --> 03:39.740
Listen, man, this is some kinda
big misunderstanding, bruh.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.735
Oh, okay.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.740
Well, then I guess we
can work this out, right?

03:48.740 --> 03:49.735
What do you think, man?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.740
Don't chamber that, shitballs.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.735
I'm cool, man.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.740
Okay, Mr. Cool, set down your piece.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.740
Put down your shells.

04:15.740 --> 04:16.740
Now step back.

04:19.740 --> 04:20.740
Hands on your head.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.735
Don't move.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.740
Hi, Rick? Hello?

04:30.740 --> 04:32.735
Hello?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.740
Shit!

04:36.740 --> 04:38.735
Does the landline work?

04:38.740 --> 04:40.735
- That...
- Mr. Cool, may I use your fucking phone?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.740
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.735
Don't fucking move.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.735
Moreweather Productions.

04:59.740 --> 05:01.735
Hi, this is Miles Daly.
Were you calling me?

05:01.740 --> 05:03.735
It's Gladys at Moreweather Productions.

05:03.740 --> 05:05.735
We got all five of your messages.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.735
I don't have Rick at the moment.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.735
But if you got any news about
your project, I can pass it along.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.732
Okay, great.

05:11.795 --> 05:14.735
I spoke with Rick about a script,
The Admiral's Mistress,

05:14.740 --> 05:16.735
um, but since our conversation...

05:16.740 --> 05:18.735
Move one more fucking inch and
I'll put a bullet in your chin.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.735
All right. I'm not moving.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.735
Since our conversation, I found
an investor to finance the movie.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.735
So all Rick would need to
do is to help me produce.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.735
We good?

05:28.740 --> 05:31.735
All clear. Yeah, just hold on.

05:31.740 --> 05:34.735
Yeah, hey, go underneath.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.740
Okay, what was that, miss?

05:37.740 --> 05:40.740
Yeah, no, I'm, uh, I'm at a play.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.740
Only a half a kilo in
the wall, 30 in cash.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.735
Who's in there?

05:51.740 --> 05:53.740
Three men, one woman.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.981
Leave the bodies. We send a message.

06:00.740 --> 06:01.735
What?

06:01.740 --> 06:03.740
They work for Josias.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.735
Estos?

06:05.740 --> 06:08.735
Say they thought Josias
had an arrangement with us.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.740
No arrangement.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.735
Why Josias fuck with me?

06:13.740 --> 06:18.735
He has a problem, he call me. I
don't drive out for this bullshit.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.740
What d'you wanna do?

07:01.740 --> 07:04.735
Well, this is pleasant.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.735
You're gonna miss me, you know.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.068
You're the one who's
gonna be alone in LA.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.735
I got a family here.

07:11.740 --> 07:14.735
Yeah, maybe you could pair up with Yago.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.735
You can sit on his lap in the Mustang,

07:16.740 --> 07:18.390
and watch Amara light people on fire.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.269
You're using Amara's money to start a

07:20.577 --> 07:22.745
business. How's that gonna turn out?

07:26.262 --> 07:27.740
Oh, you want to see some pictures?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.735
Of what?

07:30.740 --> 07:31.735
I got this book

07:31.740 --> 07:33.735
about Hollywood back in the day.

07:33.740 --> 07:38.735
There's a bar called the Bel-Air
Lounge, you can still get in.

07:38.740 --> 07:40.735
And all the Hollywood
stars used to go there.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.735
Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, uh...

07:42.740 --> 07:46.735
- Katharine Hepburn, really?
- Don't. It's...

07:46.740 --> 07:47.735
That's amazing!

07:47.740 --> 07:49.735
I know that you're... All right.

07:49.740 --> 07:50.735
I'm not moving to LA.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.740
Nobody's asking you to.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.735
I just put a down payment on my condo.

07:55.740 --> 07:59.735
Where I can sit by the pool and
enjoy a cold, refreshing drink.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.735
That's all I need. That's all I need.

08:02.740 --> 08:05.740
That's what people in
LA do, if they're lucky.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.740
And you're happy to spend the
rest of your life in this town?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.740
I am.

08:18.223 --> 08:19.735
That's only three.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.735
One's still inside.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.740
20 bucks, he doesn't make it.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.735
Shit, there he goes.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.735
Vamos.

08:35.740 --> 08:40.740
Middle of nowhere, can't
even get my fucking station.

09:03.740 --> 09:07.735
Seriously? With all ringing, I
thought someone was bleeding out here.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.735
1:00 and you're in a robe.

09:10.740 --> 09:13.735
- So?
- So here's your mail.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.735
Oh, I'm approved for a credit card.

09:15.740 --> 09:16.735
Why are you really here?

09:16.740 --> 09:19.735
Should I be looking for another job?

09:19.740 --> 09:20.735
Why, 'cause I'm in a robe?

09:20.740 --> 09:22.740
I'm working outta my home, that's all.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.735
All right, I'm cooking
eggs. Just come in.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.735
Hate overcooked eggs.

09:30.740 --> 09:31.735
You're depressed.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.735
- What?
- Hey, there's no shame in it.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.735
- If you can't pay me then...
- I can pay you.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.735
I just... I gotta get
something going, that's all.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.735
Which won't happen
unless you come to work.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.735
All right.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.238
What is this, an
intervention? I'm coming

09:45.244 --> 09:47.735
back to work. Can I
have breakfast first?

09:47.740 --> 09:48.740
At 1:00.

09:49.740 --> 09:50.740
Right.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.740
Just have some faith, for Christ's sake!

10:08.740 --> 10:10.735
Here are your drinks, guys.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.735
Hey, what's up, Mano?

10:12.740 --> 10:14.740
Pour this man a drink.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.735
Here you go, baby.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.740
Thanks.

10:20.058 --> 10:21.735
Hey, Gillis owns this club,

10:21.740 --> 10:24.735
and he's in some serious financial shit.

10:24.740 --> 10:27.735
I mean this place is going
into foreclosure, okay?

10:27.740 --> 10:29.735
So if you wanna buy in, you in, baby.

10:29.740 --> 10:31.735
It's pretty empty, man.

10:31.740 --> 10:32.735
What do they pull on a Friday night?

10:32.740 --> 10:35.735
Look, I don't know,
but it's all cash. Okay?

10:36.740 --> 10:38.735
- Hey, Gillis. Yago.
- Hey. Yago.

10:38.740 --> 10:39.735
- Yago.
- Man I was telling you about.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.735
Yeah. You guys doing all right?

10:41.740 --> 10:42.735
Just enjoying ourselves.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.735
All right. If you need
anything, another bottle

10:44.740 --> 10:45.735
or whatever, you just let me know.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.735
- Okay. Thanks.
- All right?

10:57.740 --> 11:01.735
Fuck Miles and that movie bullshit.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.735
Yeah, we could run some serious
cash through this place.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.735
Yeah, keep it in the family, you know?

11:06.740 --> 11:07.735
That's what I'm saying.

11:07.740 --> 11:09.735
We get some bomb-ass DJs from Vegas.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.735
We get Redfoo,

11:11.740 --> 11:13.740
it's wall-to-wall peeps. Bro,

11:14.740 --> 11:16.740
this is all you.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.735
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.740
All right.

11:24.441 --> 11:27.735
When I was your age, we didn't have
graduation ceremonies for every grade.

11:27.740 --> 11:31.735
Seems awful celebratory
for mastering the alphabet.

11:31.740 --> 11:34.735
It's for the parents. Make
them think we got an education.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.735
- Oh!
- No, Ben Felder's walking

11:35.740 --> 11:39.735
and he almost got kept back.
Everyone except for Andy.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.735
Oh, why not Andy?

11:40.740 --> 11:41.740
Got caught shoplifting vodka.

11:43.248 --> 11:44.623
Your friend Andy with the freckles?

11:44.740 --> 11:47.735
- He's stealing alcohol?
- From Albertsons.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.735
And that's what your
buddies do for fun, is it?

11:49.740 --> 11:51.735
Hey, it wasn't me that did it, so...

11:51.740 --> 11:54.735
- What did Mom say?
- Nothing.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.735
- Did you tell her?
- Yes.

11:56.740 --> 11:59.740
When Jeffrey was over. I knew she
wouldn't freak out then.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.735
What's Jeffrey got to do with it?

12:03.740 --> 12:05.735
Mmm, she doesn't get
pissed off when he's around.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.740
She just acts weird.
Even her laugh is weird.

12:09.740 --> 12:10.740
Is he over a lot?

12:11.740 --> 12:13.735
I mean, I guess so.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.740
They hold hands when they
watch CNN. It's really gross.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.867
Sorry.

12:28.145 --> 12:31.184
What? No, no. It's fine.

12:58.493 --> 13:00.735
So they departed out
of the land of Zarahemla,

13:00.740 --> 13:02.735
and took their swords and their spears

13:02.740 --> 13:05.735
and their bows and their
arrows and their slings.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.735
They departed out into the wilderness
to go up to the land of Nephi,

13:09.740 --> 13:12.735
to preach the word of
God unto the Lamanites.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.735
We'd like to invite
everyone to join us down the hall

13:14.740 --> 13:16.740
for light refreshments.
Have a blessed day.

13:24.740 --> 13:25.735
Oh, Tom.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.735
Brittany's laying out food.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.735
Dad, come on.

13:28.740 --> 13:29.735
Hmm, I gotta go to work, so...

13:29.740 --> 13:30.735
You close on the condo yet?

13:30.740 --> 13:32.735
No, but they did give me the keys,

13:32.740 --> 13:33.735
so Brynlee's gonna bring
the kids over tomorrow

13:33.740 --> 13:35.735
and we're gonna check out the pool.

13:35.740 --> 13:36.735
Hmm. You're gonna love the neighborhood.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.735
Got the Walmart right
there, Panda Express.

13:38.740 --> 13:39.735
- Right by the church.
- Dad.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.735
Almost don't even need a car.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.184
Ought to save on gas.

13:43.263 --> 13:44.759
Yeah, we barely go
outside a 5-mile radius.

13:44.917 --> 13:45.410
Dad!

13:45.740 --> 13:48.735
You see me having a conversation? Hmm?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.735
We'll catch you later.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.735
When I'm speaking to Uncle Louis,

13:52.740 --> 13:54.735
you need to let me finish
before you pull me away.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.740
♪ His vengeance will not slumber long ♪

13:59.740 --> 14:01.735
All right, Dick,
widen your stance a little bit.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.735
Remember, I want you to
tuck that right elbow in,

14:03.740 --> 14:05.735
your arm straight across your chest.

14:05.740 --> 14:09.735
Good. Okay. Now, grip, hip and rip.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.735
- Oh!
- There it is!

14:12.740 --> 14:15.735
There you go. Good job. Hey, there.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.735
- Hey!
- Finishing up.

14:17.740 --> 14:18.735
Uh, Dick, this is Katie.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.194
- How're you doing?
- Hi.

14:20.218 --> 14:22.735
- You play golf with this guy?
- Well, I try.

14:22.740 --> 14:23.735
Except I'm so bad, he
can't sit back and watch.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.735
Has to keep giving me instruction.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.735
We're approaching the three, and
she reaches for her five iron.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.735
I'm like, "Uh-oh!"

14:32.740 --> 14:35.735
Hey, grab a table at the
restaurant, I'll be right up, okay?

14:35.740 --> 14:38.735
Okay. Um, so you know, I'm
back at work in 50 minutes.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.740
- Okay, um...
- Good to meet you.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.735
Dick, grab your tee.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.735
She the one you told me about?

14:46.740 --> 14:49.735
With a daughter? Yeah, 12 years old.

14:49.740 --> 14:50.735
Nice kid.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.735
- She's not divorced.
- No, they're separated.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.735
But you know what?
They're on good terms.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.735
I met him the other
night, he seems fine.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.735
How's he feel about you?

15:00.740 --> 15:02.735
Oh, you know me, I get
along with everybody.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.735
Let's put it this way.
He's nothing I can't handle.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.327
Hey, you think I should give Katie the

15:09.366 --> 15:11.735
script so she knows
what the movie's about?

15:11.740 --> 15:12.740
Sure.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.735
I sent it over to that producer.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.735
Oh, they got the compressor
going, they can't hear us.

15:17.740 --> 15:18.735
I'm gonna text.

15:18.740 --> 15:20.735
I couldn't leave Owen's name on it.

15:20.740 --> 15:24.735
'Cause, well, you shot him.
So I used your name instead.

15:24.740 --> 15:25.740
Uh-huh.

15:26.740 --> 15:27.735
You what?

15:27.740 --> 15:29.735
Oh, it's no big deal. No
one cares who the writer is.

15:29.740 --> 15:31.735
You put my name as the writer?

15:31.740 --> 15:32.735
I had to put something down.

15:32.740 --> 15:33.740
So use your name.

15:35.740 --> 15:36.740
It's already done.

15:42.740 --> 15:43.735
Is it good?

15:43.740 --> 15:45.735
- What?
- The script.

15:45.740 --> 15:47.735
The fuck you care if it's any good?

15:47.740 --> 15:50.735
I don't want my name
on a script if it sucks.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.735
Lulu, it's beautiful. It is.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.735
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna ruin your reputation

15:54.740 --> 15:55.740
as a fucking writer.

15:57.740 --> 15:58.740
Come on in, I'll get it.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.735
What if Owen showed
it to somebody? Right?

16:04.740 --> 16:08.735
He had a girlfriend. That roommate.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.735
The impression I got, he
didn't give it to anybody.

16:10.740 --> 16:13.735
Oh, okay. Well, you
know what, it is sloppy.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.735
And I don't want Amara thinking
I've got anything to do with it.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.735
You think Amara's gonna care who the
fucking script writer is? Come on!

16:20.740 --> 16:23.735
All right, you don't mind getting
capped over it, that's fine.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.735
Not everybody feels that way.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.740
Thanks.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.735
Hey!

16:30.740 --> 16:32.735
Owen here?

16:32.740 --> 16:34.249
He moved out.

16:34.272 --> 16:35.267
What?

16:35.327 --> 16:37.322
Yeah, I haven't seen him in days.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.740
My calls go straight to voicemail.

16:42.089 --> 16:43.089
What?

16:45.740 --> 16:47.735
His friends came by before he took off.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.735
One of them gave me
a number, I called it,

16:49.740 --> 16:52.735
but it was disconnected.

16:52.740 --> 16:57.735
I have dated my
share of losers. But this?

16:57.740 --> 17:00.735
Taking my car and just like ghosting me?

17:00.740 --> 17:02.735
What? He took your car?

17:02.740 --> 17:03.735
Yeah. He said he'd
be right back with it,

17:03.741 --> 17:06.736
then he turned off his phone.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.060
- That's crazy.
- I know.

17:08.108 --> 17:09.734
You know, I gave him rent money,

17:09.740 --> 17:12.740
and the landlord never got
it. I'm not even on the lease.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.734
He stole from both of us.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.195
Wait, do you think he had,

17:19.202 --> 17:22.734
like, a family emergency?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.740
Why wouldn't he answer his phone?

17:25.740 --> 17:27.734
I'm Facebook friends with his sister.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.740
I'm gonna talk to his family, like, now.

17:42.740 --> 17:43.740
Hello?

17:50.740 --> 17:52.740
Hello?

17:57.740 --> 17:58.740
Is that... Rick?

18:02.740 --> 18:04.735
Your dad's upstairs, I'm
about to bring him lunch.

18:04.740 --> 18:06.735
- You want to say hey?
- No, that's fine.

18:06.740 --> 18:10.735
I just, uh, came by to give you this.

18:10.740 --> 18:14.740
That's not all of it. I'm gonna
get you all square soon, I promise.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.301
Small hiccup in one of my projects,

18:17.357 --> 18:18.740
but it's all gonna work out.

18:19.740 --> 18:20.735
Okay, Pamela. Thanks.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.740
Uh, you don't want to go up?

18:23.740 --> 18:25.735
Oh. He heard me.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.740
If he doesn't want to
come down, it's fine.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.740
Bye-bye.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.735
Well, it's not a cult movie, per Se.

18:34.740 --> 18:39.735
You know what, I'll send the
treatment over to you, you can...

18:39.740 --> 18:43.735
Yeah, no worries, no worries. No,
no, I'm just checking in, that's all.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.735
Say hi to Mary for me. Okay. Bye-bye.

18:46.740 --> 18:49.735
Too many cult movies in development.

18:49.740 --> 18:50.740
This came from Miles Daly.

18:51.525 --> 18:52.274
Who?

18:52.313 --> 18:54.735
Dropped in last week, didn't have
an appointment. He pitched to you.

18:54.740 --> 18:57.735
Oh, no. No. No, no, no,
no, no. That guy's not real.

18:57.740 --> 18:58.735
He said he has private financing.

18:58.740 --> 19:01.740
All you gotta do is produce,
and you could pay yourself a fee.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.735
You know, I read it. It's good.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.735
- You read it?
- It's been slow recently.

19:09.740 --> 19:13.735
No. No. I've been doing this too long

19:13.740 --> 19:15.735
to use spare change from
the couch cushions, so...

19:15.740 --> 19:18.735
Jimmy! Hey, listen. It's Rick.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.735
I gotta, uh, a thing I
want to sneak over to you.

19:21.740 --> 19:22.735
It's this fantastic property.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.735
Uh-huh.

19:24.740 --> 19:27.735
Little graphic novel called
Children of the Wicked.

19:27.740 --> 19:31.740
And it... No. No, no, no, I didn't.
I pitched something different.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.740
I did? Shit!

19:37.740 --> 19:38.735
Well, you know,

19:38.740 --> 19:41.740
you and I should find
something 'cause together...

19:44.740 --> 19:46.735
Mmm-hmm.

19:46.740 --> 19:48.740
Take care.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.735
Wait till you see this condo.

20:06.740 --> 20:07.735
Feel like I've already seen it

20:07.740 --> 20:09.735
'cause you've told me so much about it.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.740
It's east-facing, so, you
know, you get lots of light.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.740
Pool has 24-hour access.

20:18.199 --> 20:20.199
Partake in a lot of
night swimming, do you?

20:26.740 --> 20:29.735
It's near my sister, you know.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.735
You know, I was talking to my
brother-in-law at church today.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.735
- You remember Tom.
- Not really.

20:33.741 --> 20:36.449
And he was telling me about
just how much they love it there.

20:36.489 --> 20:39.735
I mean, they really feel like
they found a home, you know.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.740
Everything they need is nearby.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.735
Is that what you really want though, Lu?

20:45.740 --> 20:48.735
To be stuck in an even smaller
part of an ugly fucking desert?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.208
I mean, I get it. I do.

20:50.295 --> 20:54.735
It's... familiar, which
I suppose is comforting.

20:54.740 --> 20:55.735
You know I don't think you do get it.

20:55.740 --> 20:58.735
Because you're from Ireland,

20:58.740 --> 21:01.735
and, you know, this is not home for you.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.740
For me, it is.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.735
You're right. Don't listen to me. I...

21:08.740 --> 21:11.735
I just wish you were
coming with me, Lulu.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.735
Well, I'm sure this movie thing
is going to work out for you.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.735
This condo sounds lovely.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.740
Yeah.

21:28.740 --> 21:31.740
And the noise from the
highway doesn't bother you?

21:32.740 --> 21:34.735
What are you talking about?

21:34.740 --> 21:38.735
Well, it's just off the 160, isn't
it? The noise doesn't bother you?

21:38.740 --> 21:39.735
- What you mean? Traffic noise?
- Yeah.

21:39.740 --> 21:43.740
No! You know... I
mean, you don't hear it.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.740
Huh.

21:57.740 --> 22:00.735
Hey, Jerry Fuckheimer.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.740
Yeah. That's good.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.735
That all of it?

22:15.740 --> 22:17.740
Except the girls from Bell
Vista. They need another day.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.735
And you gave it to them
without checking with me?

22:21.740 --> 22:23.735
That is what happened, yeah.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.740
We'll get it to you
tomorrow, first thing.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.740
Hmm, great.

22:29.740 --> 22:33.735
Also, um,

22:33.740 --> 22:35.735
when you get around to it...

22:35.740 --> 22:37.735
Would you pull your
head out of your ass?

22:37.740 --> 22:40.740
Hmm?

22:43.740 --> 22:45.735
Fucking prick...

22:45.740 --> 22:48.735
- Just don't. Okay? Just...
- I'm not. I'm not.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.735
You know, I went by
the condo three times.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.735
- You don't hear the highway.
- I find that surprising.

22:52.740 --> 22:54.735
You don't hear it. It's...

22:54.740 --> 22:55.740
Hold on.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.735
This fucking guy.
What did I fucking say?

23:00.740 --> 23:03.735
Hey, Rick.

23:03.740 --> 23:05.735
No, no. It's great to hear from you.

23:05.740 --> 23:08.735
Um,

23:08.740 --> 23:12.735
I'm in the middle of a
business meeting right now.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.740
Um, I could be there tonight.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.740
Great. Where do you wanna meet?

23:19.740 --> 23:22.735
Oh! You didn't have to do this.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.735
Wanted to say thank
you for taking the time.

23:24.740 --> 23:27.735
Is it too early to open it? Come on.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.735
Don't tell Gladys. She
thinks I'm depressed.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.735
I dunno, it's a long
story. Sit down, sit down.

23:32.740 --> 23:35.614
So, uh, you got a private investor, huh?

23:35.620 --> 23:36.735
I do. I do.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.735
Okay.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.740
And, uh, what's the budget?

23:42.740 --> 23:43.735
How much money you got?

23:43.740 --> 23:45.740
How much will we need?

23:46.740 --> 23:48.735
Well, script the way it is,

23:48.740 --> 23:51.735
you got a lot of period costumes,

23:51.740 --> 23:54.735
a couple castles, got over 100 extras.

23:54.740 --> 23:56.735
If you don't go crazy above the line...

23:56.740 --> 23:58.735
30 million.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.735
Fuck me!

24:00.740 --> 24:03.735
Cheers. It's...

24:03.740 --> 24:06.740
Rick, you think there's any way
we could do it for two million?

24:07.740 --> 24:08.740
Two.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.735
Well...

24:11.740 --> 24:15.740
You know, a lot of producers would
tell you, "Uh, it's impossible."

24:16.740 --> 24:20.735
I happen to be, not to
toot my own horn here,

24:20.740 --> 24:24.735
I have a lot of experience in making
films like this in that price range.

24:24.740 --> 24:27.735
- Oh!
- And there's an art to it.

24:27.740 --> 24:28.735
I don't doubt that.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.735
Now, if we were to take this and rethink

24:30.740 --> 24:33.740
some of the elements that
aren't essential to the script,

24:36.740 --> 24:38.735
I could do it.

24:38.740 --> 24:43.735
That's good. That's... Great attitude.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.735
Also, we're gonna need to
make our money back on it.

24:45.740 --> 24:47.735
That's a really important thing.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.735
Yeah, I will. I mean,
if I were to come on.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.735
I would presell to foreign markets.

24:52.740 --> 24:55.735
That's how you do it.
That's how you recoup, okay?

24:55.739 --> 24:56.753
Need anything before I take off?

24:56.859 --> 24:58.854
No. Goodnight, Gladys.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.712
- You drinking?
- I am. Yeah.

25:01.740 --> 25:03.735
It's a gift from my friend.

25:03.740 --> 25:05.735
Good night.

25:05.739 --> 25:08.734
Okay, tell me about this investor.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.487
Amara De Escalones. She owns a casino

25:11.493 --> 25:14.745
in Pahrump, Nevada, and she's my boss.

25:15.740 --> 25:16.735
You work in a casino?

25:16.740 --> 25:17.740
Indirectly.

25:20.740 --> 25:21.735
Okay.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.740
And, uh, the writer. Who's the writer?

25:25.740 --> 25:27.735
He... He works with us, also.

25:27.740 --> 25:29.735
The writer works at a casino?

25:29.740 --> 25:31.735
Here's the thing about Amara.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.735
She doesn't like to travel,

25:34.740 --> 25:35.735
and she's gonna need to meet you

25:35.740 --> 25:37.735
before she'll sign on to anything.

25:37.740 --> 25:38.740
So you think you can come out?

25:39.740 --> 25:40.735
To Hahrump?

25:40.740 --> 25:41.735
Pahrump.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.735
It's just outside Vegas.

25:44.740 --> 25:48.735
Well, production's gonna have to
fly me first class. And put me up.

25:48.740 --> 25:49.740
Best hotel in town.

25:51.740 --> 25:52.740
In Pahrump.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.740
So you're in?

26:03.740 --> 26:05.735
- Hey, Tia.
- What?

26:05.740 --> 26:07.735
I said, "Hey."

26:07.740 --> 26:08.735
It's nice, right?

26:08.740 --> 26:11.735
Got us a private table,
champagne, it's...

26:11.740 --> 26:12.740
Too loud.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.740
No.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.735
No.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.735
You sure, Tia? It's...

26:21.740 --> 26:22.740
It's Cristal.

26:27.740 --> 26:31.735
So this place does all
their business in cash.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.735
At the door and the bar.

26:33.740 --> 26:36.735
No oversight, which means we could
make up whatever figure we want.

26:36.740 --> 26:37.740
This fucking music.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.735
We could run all our cash
through this company, Tia.

26:44.740 --> 26:48.735
And I'd handle everything, so
there'd be no problem with the books.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.735
All we need is the
initial investment and...

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
I can't hear. It's too fucking loud.

26:54.740 --> 26:55.740
What?

26:57.740 --> 26:58.735
All right, well, then,

26:58.740 --> 26:59.735
maybe we'll talk about it tomorrow,

26:59.740 --> 27:01.735
because this is a good opportunity, Tia.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.735
Yo, yo, yo, yo, why is she taking off?

27:03.740 --> 27:04.740
She's into it, right?

27:10.740 --> 27:12.735
Hang on. Coming.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.735
Shit!

27:15.740 --> 27:18.735
Oh! Hi.

27:18.740 --> 27:21.740
I was expecting UPS.
You're Miles, right?

27:22.740 --> 27:23.740
Jeffrey.

27:24.740 --> 27:25.735
Katie here?

27:25.740 --> 27:27.735
No. Uh, no. She'll be right back.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.113
She just took Emma to school and then

27:29.119 --> 27:30.745
she's gonna run to the grocery store.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.735
Do you wanna... Do you
wanna wait inside for her?

27:34.740 --> 27:35.735
Yeah, that'll be good.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.735
Okay. I'll text her. I'll
tell her that you're here.

27:37.740 --> 27:38.735
Was she expecting you?

27:38.740 --> 27:39.740
No.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.735
Um...

27:45.740 --> 27:48.735
Hey, Miles, I'd love to offer
you an espresso or something,

27:48.740 --> 27:51.735
but I cannot figure out
how to work this machine.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
I know how to work it.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.735
But no thanks.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.740
All right. Let me get these on.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.735
This is weird, isn't it?

28:08.740 --> 28:10.740
Yeah. I guess it is.

28:11.740 --> 28:13.740
What do you do, Miles?

28:14.740 --> 28:15.735
Katie didn't tell ya?

28:15.740 --> 28:17.735
Yeah, of cour... Right.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.740
She said you worked at a casino.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.389
The Silver Dust, in Pahrump.

28:23.740 --> 28:24.735
How about you, Jeffrey?

28:24.740 --> 28:29.137
I'm a golf pro at Sandy
Springs Country Club.

28:29.257 --> 28:32.735
You know, I'm teaching lessons
and holding tournaments.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.735
So it's a lot of
paperwork, too, actually.

28:34.740 --> 28:35.735
- I'm at a desk a lot...
- May I?

28:35.740 --> 28:38.735
Yeah. Of co... Yeah. Sure.

28:38.740 --> 28:39.735
Very nice.

28:39.740 --> 28:41.735
Do you golf?

28:41.740 --> 28:43.735
No. Not really.

28:43.740 --> 28:46.735
Well, what you're holding there
is an adjustable golf club.

28:46.740 --> 28:50.735
You can actually change the,
um, the angle of the face.

28:50.740 --> 28:53.735
Whoa! Whoa!

28:53.740 --> 28:54.735
Adjustable, huh?

28:54.740 --> 28:57.735
Yeah. I... I can get you
a free one, if you want.

28:57.740 --> 28:58.735
- Come on.
- No, seriously.

28:58.740 --> 29:00.552
They send me stuff all
the time for promotions.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.735
I got a couple of those gathering dust.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.735
Miles, you should have one.

29:04.740 --> 29:05.735
Ah, it's wasted on me.

29:05.740 --> 29:06.985
No, it's not.

29:07.183 --> 29:09.735
Listen, golf, it's the game
of kings. Here, you just...

29:09.740 --> 29:12.735
You gotta go easy on your
backstroke. Hold a second.

29:12.740 --> 29:14.735
See where your hips are right now?

29:14.740 --> 29:15.735
Okay.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.735
What that is, is a reverse pivot.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.735
It's gonna make it really difficult

29:19.740 --> 29:20.735
for you to control the distance
and the direction of the ball.

29:20.740 --> 29:23.735
So... Here.

29:23.740 --> 29:25.735
There you go. Widen your stance.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.735
- All right?
- Well, a little more.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.735
- Widen your stance.
- Okay.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.740
Relax your arms and your hips here.

29:30.740 --> 29:31.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.740
You get the idea.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.735
What the fuck are you doing here?

29:40.740 --> 29:42.236
What? I needed to talk,
and then things got...

29:42.242 --> 29:42.735
No.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.001
You need to call before you come over.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.163
He seems nice.

29:48.358 --> 29:49.353
Glad you think so.

29:49.464 --> 29:51.735
And that's who you want to be
with? Arnold fucking Palmer?

29:51.740 --> 29:53.735
Well, at least, I can
tell people what he does.

29:53.740 --> 29:58.002
If you weren't with that guy,
we'd be making fun of that guy.

29:59.740 --> 30:00.735
Okay. Goodbye.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.735
Hold on, hold on. Reason I came over...

30:02.740 --> 30:05.735
I know that for this to
work, I need to make changes,

30:05.740 --> 30:07.735
and I've been doing that. I have. I...

30:07.740 --> 30:09.735
We so can't do this now.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.740
Look, call first, we'll talk.

30:13.740 --> 30:14.740
Bye.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.740
Just be nice to
your sister, you hear me?

30:31.740 --> 30:32.735
Hey, sweetie.

30:32.740 --> 30:35.024
Why don't you get your uncle
one of those root beers?

30:43.740 --> 30:46.735
Oh, I've been waiting for this. Yeah.

30:46.740 --> 30:47.740
Nice.

30:48.740 --> 30:53.740
Just lie back and soak up some rays.

31:18.740 --> 31:21.735
Tell me something honestly.
Does the freeway bother you?

31:21.740 --> 31:22.740
What?

31:24.740 --> 31:25.740
You can hear it.

31:26.740 --> 31:29.740
I didn't till you mentioned it.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.740
But now that I did?

31:34.740 --> 31:35.735
Who cares?

31:35.740 --> 31:36.735
It's a two-bedroom place with a pool.

31:36.740 --> 31:39.735
You can raise a family here.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.740
I guess, yeah.

31:42.740 --> 31:44.740
When you meet the right girl.

31:46.740 --> 31:47.735
Hmm?

31:54.740 --> 31:56.735
Who the fuck put that there?

31:56.740 --> 31:57.913
Language.

31:58.024 --> 32:01.740
Bobby, you keep splashing
your sister and you are out.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.735
So Tom told me that ever
since you guys moved here,

32:09.740 --> 32:11.735
you don't ever go anywhere.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.740
Well, we got the Walmart.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.735
Maybe that's not a good thing.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.735
Bobby!

32:18.740 --> 32:19.740
I am warning you.

32:22.740 --> 32:23.740
Hmm.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.735
I could do this all day.

32:33.740 --> 32:34.735
Come on, man.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.735
My brother don't talk
to me about this shit.

32:36.740 --> 32:37.735
That's too bad.

32:38.740 --> 32:39.740
Don't kill me.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.735
Josias's saying Amara's out of control.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.735
Out of control how?

32:47.740 --> 32:50.735
That she... She's
dropping bodies every week.

32:50.740 --> 32:51.735
She's got feds watching.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.735
You fucked with Josias' business,

32:53.740 --> 32:55.735
so now Josias's moving
on Amara's territory.

32:55.740 --> 32:56.735
What else Josias got planned?

32:56.740 --> 32:58.740
I don't know.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.740
Call your brother, we'll listen.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.735
I can't set him up like that.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.740
Hey.

33:20.740 --> 33:21.735
He's one of ours.

33:21.740 --> 33:22.735
So?

33:22.740 --> 33:24.735
So go easy.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.735
I am going easy.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.735
When you spoke to Amara this morning,

33:29.740 --> 33:31.735
she say anything about the club?

33:31.740 --> 33:32.735
No.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.735
'Cause that was a slow night.

33:34.740 --> 33:35.735
We get Redfoo up in there.

33:35.740 --> 33:37.740
That place is gonna blow up.

33:38.740 --> 33:39.735
Listen,

33:39.740 --> 33:42.735
I know she's meeting
with this movie guy.

33:42.740 --> 33:44.735
But we can't get involved
with that Hollywood shit.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.740
It's not my business. Let's handle this.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.735
Rick.

33:54.740 --> 33:55.735
Hey.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.740
How was your flight?

33:57.740 --> 33:59.735
It was on that.

33:59.740 --> 34:02.735
It's the only direct flight.
Doesn't really have a first class.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.740
Oh, let me get that.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.735
That? That's the casino?

34:14.739 --> 34:17.735
She'll ask about money,
all right? How much, and when.

34:17.739 --> 34:19.735
Yeah, yeah. I know
the drill. Don't worry.

34:19.739 --> 34:20.735
I'm gonna give a little
bit of Hollywood sizzle.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.735
Okay, don't get cute.

34:22.739 --> 34:24.735
She looks like a silly old
woman, but believe me, she is not.

34:24.739 --> 34:28.735
Also, she likes John Stamos.

34:28.739 --> 34:29.739
For this?

34:30.739 --> 34:31.735
Know him?

34:31.739 --> 34:32.739
Oh, that's our writer.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.735
Of course, it is.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.735
- You're the movie guy, right?
- That's me.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.735
Hey, great job on that script.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.735
Thank you. It means a lot.

34:42.739 --> 34:45.735
Uh, before you talk to
Amara, could I have a word?

34:45.739 --> 34:46.735
Sure.

34:46.739 --> 34:48.739
Hang steady, Rick.

34:52.739 --> 34:53.735
What's up?

34:53.739 --> 34:57.735
You and me have been working
together all this time.

34:57.740 --> 34:59.735
And I realized that for your sake,

34:59.740 --> 35:04.735
I cannot let you go to
LA without backup, right?

35:04.740 --> 35:07.740
I mean, especially now
that I'm the writer.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.735
That's right.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.735
You're gonna come with me?

35:11.740 --> 35:12.740
Just till you get on your feet.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.433
You worried about Amara?

35:15.489 --> 35:18.735
Okay. Well, as long as she
knows that this is your thing,

35:18.740 --> 35:20.735
- and I'm just coming along.
- Hmm.

35:20.740 --> 35:21.735
You got a place to stay, right?

35:21.740 --> 35:23.735
Just a furnished place I found online.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.735
There's only one bed, but
we can get an air mattress.

35:25.740 --> 35:29.735
Okay. Well, I can get my down
payment back for the condo.

35:29.740 --> 35:31.735
It's a nice place, but if I go to LA,

35:31.740 --> 35:35.735
I mean, if that's what ends up
happening, I'll just walk away from it.

35:35.740 --> 35:36.735
Thanks, man.

35:36.740 --> 35:38.740
Come on, now. You're my boy.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.740
Two million?

35:48.740 --> 35:50.735
Well, we don't have a budget yet,

35:50.740 --> 35:52.735
but it'll be in that neighborhood.

35:52.740 --> 35:54.735
Well, that's thorough security.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.735
It's a casino.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.735
Yeah, it's... It's beautiful.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.740
Rick Moreweather.

36:02.740 --> 36:03.740
A pleasure.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.735
So you move to LA?

36:07.740 --> 36:09.735
Financially, I'll be responsible.

36:09.740 --> 36:13.735
So yeah, I'll have
Louis there for back up,

36:13.740 --> 36:15.740
and Rick will help produce.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.735
Which movies you make?

36:22.740 --> 36:24.735
Oh, uh, I don't know
if you've heard of them.

36:24.740 --> 36:26.735
Day of Reckoning. Out for Blood.

36:26.740 --> 36:27.735
Hmm...

36:27.740 --> 36:29.735
Of course, this one,

36:29.740 --> 36:31.740
this is a totally different tone.

36:35.740 --> 36:36.740
He looks like John Stamos.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.735
Yeah?

36:40.740 --> 36:41.735
Yeah, little bit, yeah.

36:41.740 --> 36:42.735
His cousin, maybe.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.740
Right.

36:45.740 --> 36:46.735
I just saw Stamos.

36:46.740 --> 36:47.735
Where?

36:47.740 --> 36:49.740
DMV in Studio City.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.735
You guarantee this investment?

36:53.740 --> 36:58.735
Well, "guarantee" is a... A pretty
strong term in the movie business.

36:58.740 --> 37:01.735
We're going to lean on
foreign sales to recoup...

37:01.740 --> 37:03.740
We will absolutely recoup.

37:05.740 --> 37:09.735
My last 18 films have made a profit.

37:09.740 --> 37:12.740
I don't know even know another
producer that can say that.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.735
I'll cut a check for
200 grand on the books.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.735
Then, we'll hand-deliver three payments

37:23.740 --> 37:25.740
of 600,000 each, in cash.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.735
Cash?

37:28.740 --> 37:29.735
Three payments.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.735
Yes, but...

37:31.740 --> 37:33.735
In cash?

37:33.740 --> 37:34.735
That a problem?

37:34.740 --> 37:38.740
It's perfect. It's
perfect, isn't it? Rick.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:43.740 --> 37:45.740
Who doesn't like cash?

37:51.740 --> 37:53.735
Two million, holy shit.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.735
We're actually doing this.

37:55.740 --> 37:56.735
Okay.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.735
That stuff about the recoup,
Rick, that was perfect.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.735
Okay, I gotta go home and pack,
and say goodbye to my sister.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.735
Rick, it was very nice to meet you.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.735
Looks like we'll be working together.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.735
Yeah, I guess so.

38:06.740 --> 38:09.735
Why don't you get me a cab, and
I'll, uh, go to my hotel now.

38:09.740 --> 38:12.740
Uh, no need. We can walk.
Best hotel in Pahrump.

38:13.502 --> 38:14.502
Oh, no.

38:16.740 --> 38:19.735
Doesn't look like much, but it's
actually real, real nice inside.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.740
You hungry? I'm hungry.

38:32.343 --> 38:34.338
Steak and fries from Lucy's Diner.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.735
You will not be disappointed.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.735
Tomorrow me and Louis can get the
money, and we'll drive to Los Angeles,

38:39.740 --> 38:42.735
meet you at the Bel-Air
Lounge to celebrate, all right?

38:42.740 --> 38:43.735
You know the Bel-Air Lounge?

38:43.740 --> 38:45.287
- It's an old Hollywood hangout.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.223
Can we talk about
what's really going on?

38:47.740 --> 38:49.735
What do you mean?

38:49.740 --> 38:52.735
What is it? Tax
evasion? Is that it, huh?

38:52.740 --> 38:56.735
90% off the books. And...

38:56.779 --> 39:00.779
Okay. I may look like a small
fish in a big pond, but...

39:01.208 --> 39:03.049
I am strictly legit.

39:04.740 --> 39:05.735
If I'm liable...

39:05.740 --> 39:06.735
Liable for what?

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
I don't know.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.740
Then what are we talking about?

39:13.740 --> 39:15.735
You're funny.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.740
It's $2 million to make a movie, right?

39:18.740 --> 39:20.740
How is that not legit?

39:22.740 --> 39:25.735
Oh, okay. So what you're saying is

39:25.740 --> 39:27.740
the less I know...

39:29.740 --> 39:31.740
Is that what I'm saying?

39:35.740 --> 39:36.735
What do you do, again?

39:36.739 --> 39:38.226
Have a steak, Rick.

39:38.271 --> 39:41.266
There's ketchup, steak sauce.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.296
Glass of brown liquor.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.735
Okay, so... So what?

39:51.740 --> 39:53.735
Tomorrow we're gonna
get 600,000 in cash?

39:53.740 --> 39:55.735
Huh?

39:55.740 --> 39:57.735
In what, a... A paper bag?

39:57.740 --> 40:00.740
If it makes you feel better,
I'll put it in a briefcase.

40:01.740 --> 40:03.740
Eat your meat. It's getting cold.

40:06.740 --> 40:08.740
No, you don't mess with Amara.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.740
I love and respect that woman.

40:13.740 --> 40:14.735
But her judgment...

40:14.740 --> 40:15.740
Exactly.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.735
I'm not saying she's going senile.

40:19.740 --> 40:22.735
But running our money through
Miles and some half-assed movie

40:22.740 --> 40:24.735
because she wants to
meet John fucking Stamos?

40:24.740 --> 40:26.735
Fucking Miles, bro.

40:26.740 --> 40:28.735
Should erase that cocksucker.

40:28.740 --> 40:29.740
Boom.

40:33.740 --> 40:35.735
I'm serious.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.735
Yeah, so am I, bro.

40:37.740 --> 40:39.735
Look, I got people, all right?

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
You just give the word.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.735
That couldn't come back on us.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.735
That's what I'm saying, all right?

40:45.740 --> 40:47.735
- We get one of my boys...
- Mmm-hmm.

40:47.740 --> 40:48.735
What you say?

40:48.740 --> 40:49.740
The fuck!

40:51.740 --> 40:54.735
How long you been there
standing behind us?

40:54.740 --> 40:56.735
You wanna get shitfaced,
don't do it here.

40:56.740 --> 40:58.735
Don't tell me where to drink.

40:58.740 --> 40:59.735
This man here?

40:59.740 --> 41:01.740
He can drink where the fuck he want.

41:09.740 --> 41:13.735
Shit! He hear what we say?
Fat ass fly on the wall.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.735
Nah, nah, nah, he just walked up.

41:17.740 --> 41:20.735
Hey, can we get another round,
or you gonna make us beg?

41:20.740 --> 41:23.735
Hey, who's gonna pay for
the Bel-Air Lounge tomorrow?

41:23.740 --> 41:25.735
Is that from the bag of cash?

41:25.740 --> 41:27.735
Business expense.

41:27.740 --> 41:28.740
I got you something here.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.740
That's a movie I made in '93.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.735
Don't think I have a VCR.

41:38.740 --> 41:39.735
Could maybe pick one up at a pawnshop.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.735
That's a period drama
that I made for cheap.

41:42.740 --> 41:43.735
Uh-huh, one location.

41:43.740 --> 41:46.735
No... No horse-drawn carriage bullshit.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.735
Added sex scene in
there. Nothing graphic.

41:48.740 --> 41:49.735
Enough to sell it overseas.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.735
And it turned out good?

41:51.740 --> 41:53.735
Well, "good," that's...

41:53.740 --> 41:55.735
It's a subjective term, right?

41:55.740 --> 41:57.735
No, but you're saying

41:57.740 --> 41:59.740
if we do ours like this, it'll be good.

42:03.740 --> 42:06.735
You ever hear of, uh,
Giustino Morrongiello?

42:06.740 --> 42:07.735
Um...

42:07.740 --> 42:09.735
He directed Death in New Orleans.

42:09.740 --> 42:11.735
Oh, that's a great fucking movie.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.735
Giustino is my dad.

42:13.740 --> 42:14.735
No shit. Your dad directed that?

42:14.740 --> 42:18.735
Okay, despite all the... The
critical acclaim, he was always broke.

42:18.740 --> 42:19.735
We got evicted two times.

42:19.740 --> 42:22.735
Not that he cared, he was off.
He was making a film somewhere.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.735
The last film he made
lost so much money,

42:24.740 --> 42:27.735
he bankrupted the fucking studio.

42:27.740 --> 42:30.740
And now, guess who's
paying the mortgage?

42:32.740 --> 42:34.740
I bet he's proud of you.

42:36.740 --> 42:37.740
Proud?

42:39.740 --> 42:43.735
Look, the point I'm making is
you wanna make your money back?

42:43.740 --> 42:44.735
Have to.

42:44.740 --> 42:48.740
Don't get hung up then
on that "quality" thing.

42:53.740 --> 42:54.740
Right.

42:58.740 --> 42:59.740
Katie.

43:01.740 --> 43:04.740
Uh, yeah, uh, just have him
wait in the lobby. Thanks.

43:06.239 --> 43:09.735
It's crazy, I know, but I
got my hands on this script.

43:09.740 --> 43:12.735
Long story... And I...
I think it's amazin'.

43:12.740 --> 43:15.735
So I got it to this
producer that I met in LA,

43:15.740 --> 43:19.740
and I said, "You gotta read this,
man. This has got to be made."

43:20.740 --> 43:22.735
You're... You're making a movie.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.735
Yeah.

43:24.740 --> 43:25.740
- This is happening.
- It is!

43:29.740 --> 43:32.735
And why would
Amara let you just walk away?

43:32.740 --> 43:35.735
I... I'm still working
out the final details over,

43:35.740 --> 43:36.735
but it's not gonna be a problem.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.740
We're driving to Los Angeles today.

43:39.740 --> 43:41.735
You're moving?

43:41.740 --> 43:43.740
Not moving... I'm just... For a bit.

43:44.740 --> 43:46.740
Well, thanks for telling me.

43:47.740 --> 43:50.735
You forget you have a daughter?

43:50.740 --> 43:54.735
For fuck's... That's...
That's why I'm doing this,

43:54.740 --> 43:56.735
so we can be a family.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.735
When school break's up,

43:58.740 --> 44:00.740
I thought that... That
you could both come to LA.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.735
We can't come to LA.

44:03.740 --> 44:05.735
Why not?

44:05.740 --> 44:08.184
My job. The... The
house. The guy I'm seeing!

44:08.287 --> 44:10.735
The golf pro?

44:10.740 --> 44:13.735
That fuckin' polo shirt
with the turned-up collar?

44:13.740 --> 44:14.740
Not a turned up collar.

44:18.740 --> 44:19.735
Well, what about Emma then?

44:19.740 --> 44:22.740
I... I don't like this crowd
that she's running with here.

44:23.740 --> 44:25.735
Excuse me?

44:25.740 --> 44:28.735
Andy, with the fuckin'
freckles, steals vodka.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.735
Which means that he's
drinking at 12 years old.

44:30.740 --> 44:33.735
I know that she told you about this.

44:33.740 --> 44:37.735
You're worried about
her deviant 12-year-old friends.

44:37.740 --> 44:41.735
Your friends are a fuck of a lot
worse than Andy with the freckles.

44:41.740 --> 44:45.735
God, if you're making a movie, it
is some kind of racket. I...

44:45.740 --> 44:46.735
It's not.

44:46.740 --> 44:50.121
There's always an angle. A shakedown.

44:50.168 --> 44:51.735
That's not what this is.

44:51.740 --> 44:54.735
It's a real... It's
a real movie! I swear!

44:54.740 --> 44:55.735
It's an amazing story, Katie.

44:55.740 --> 44:57.735
This guy, this young Irish guy,

44:57.740 --> 45:00.735
he has to go to war to redeem himself.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.735
To the woman that he loves.

45:02.741 --> 45:05.599
But then he returns home and he
realizes that he's been cuckolded.

45:05.605 --> 45:07.015
And he doesn't know how
to deal with it, so...

45:07.021 --> 45:07.735
I'm sorry. Miles...

45:07.740 --> 45:08.740
Uh... I have to get back.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.740
Don't forget Emma's graduation.

45:18.092 --> 45:20.735
Listen to the birds. It almost
sounds as if they're talking.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.735
Well, they are talking.
Those are whip-poor-wills.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.740
They'll be making their nest now.

45:27.740 --> 45:29.735
Hey, hey, buddy.

45:29.740 --> 45:34.735
What do you say we broaden
our fuckin' horizons, huh?

45:34.740 --> 45:37.735
Welcome the pigeon-doves.

45:37.740 --> 45:38.735
How do you know about such a thing?

45:38.740 --> 45:40.735
- What's this?
- Movie Rick made.

45:40.740 --> 45:41.735
Oh, how is it?

45:41.740 --> 45:43.740
Worst thing I've ever seen.

45:44.740 --> 45:46.735
So stop watchin' it.

45:46.740 --> 45:48.740
We gotta go. We got a four-hour drive.

45:49.740 --> 45:51.735
Katie said if I'm makin' a movie,

45:51.740 --> 45:53.735
it must be some sort of con.

45:53.740 --> 45:54.735
And I said, "No, it's not."

45:54.740 --> 45:56.735
And then I come home and watch it.

45:56.740 --> 45:57.735
Are you watching this?

45:57.740 --> 46:00.735
Uh, no, not really.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.735
Every time the door shuts,
you can see the walls shake.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.735
I mean, if this is the kind
of movie we're gonna make,

46:05.740 --> 46:08.740
then the whole thing is a
con! I mean, that's all it is.

46:09.740 --> 46:10.740
Yeah.

46:13.740 --> 46:14.740
I don't follow.

46:16.740 --> 46:18.735
The Godfather.

46:18.740 --> 46:19.735
Right?

46:19.740 --> 46:20.735
Raging Bull. Taxi Driver.

46:20.740 --> 46:22.735
That's the kinda movie you wanna make.

46:22.740 --> 46:24.740
Not this horse shit.

46:26.740 --> 46:30.735
So you work your way up to that, right?

46:30.740 --> 46:34.735
But you make your
money back on this one.

46:34.740 --> 46:35.735
- I...
- And Amara lets you live.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.735
Hey, that's a bonus, right?

46:37.740 --> 46:40.735
And maybe next time, it's, you
know, the... The Taxi Drivers.

46:40.740 --> 46:42.735
It's one driver.

46:42.740 --> 46:44.735
Come on, man.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.493
I come in here, I'm all excited,

46:46.541 --> 46:49.735
and you're just a... Debbie
Downer. I can't keep up.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.740
Shouldn't we at least go before
traffic fucks us in the ass?

47:09.740 --> 47:11.735
What the fuck?

47:11.740 --> 47:12.735
Open the safe.

47:12.740 --> 47:13.735
Open the safe!

47:13.740 --> 47:15.735
I don't know the combo,
okay? I swear to God!

47:15.740 --> 47:16.740
Who does?

47:20.740 --> 47:21.735
Oh, shit!

47:21.740 --> 47:23.735
What up, bro? You remember me?

47:23.740 --> 47:26.735
Yeah, I'm the one you
asked about my teeth.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.740
Asked if they made me a gangsta?

47:43.740 --> 47:45.735
Hello?

47:45.740 --> 47:47.326
Well, we can stop worrying about Owen.

47:47.517 --> 47:51.735
Piece of shit is on a beach, drinking
cocktails with little umbrellas.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.735
How do you know?

47:53.740 --> 47:58.735
Got onto his email account
and found the receipt for his flight

47:58.740 --> 48:02.735
to Mexico. One way to San Felipe.

48:02.740 --> 48:03.735
Wow.

48:03.740 --> 48:05.735
Yeah, wow.

48:05.740 --> 48:07.735
And... And what did he do with your car?

48:07.740 --> 48:09.740
Probably sold it. And then
got a new phone number.

48:11.740 --> 48:13.735
I think I was dating
a professional thief.

48:13.740 --> 48:16.735
He seemed so...

48:16.740 --> 48:18.735
Nerdy, right?

48:18.740 --> 48:19.735
He was staying with
me three nights a week.

48:19.740 --> 48:22.735
Asking me for my opinion
on his stupid scripts.

48:22.740 --> 48:24.735
And I thought I knew him.

48:24.740 --> 48:28.735
I was, like, supposed to meet
his aunt. His favorite aunt.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.740
Who was coming back here from Thailand.

48:31.773 --> 48:33.416
_

48:40.740 --> 48:42.735
Look at this place.

48:42.740 --> 48:44.735
It's just like the book.
It's great, isn't it?

48:44.740 --> 48:46.735
Yeah, it better be.

48:46.740 --> 48:48.740
20 bucks for fuckin' parking.

48:50.740 --> 48:51.735
Rick.

48:51.740 --> 48:54.735
Oh, gentlemen.

48:54.740 --> 48:56.735
All right, you made it, huh?

48:56.740 --> 48:59.735
So did these, uh, famous
actors really eat here?

48:59.740 --> 49:00.735
They did.

49:00.740 --> 49:03.735
Bob Hope, uh, threw up on that wall.

49:03.740 --> 49:04.735
Hah!

49:04.740 --> 49:06.735
Well, I don't see anybody famous now.

49:06.740 --> 49:08.735
Let's get a bottle of good champagne.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.735
The expensive one...

49:10.740 --> 49:11.735
The cheaper expensive one.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.735
Ginger ale.

49:12.740 --> 49:14.735
I'm good for now. Thank you.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.740
And this is for you.

49:19.740 --> 49:20.735
It is a paper bag.

49:20.740 --> 49:22.735
It's, uh, 600,000?

49:22.740 --> 49:24.740
Minus expenses for
myself and Louis here.

49:27.740 --> 49:30.735
Okay. All right.

49:30.740 --> 49:32.735
Well, let's eat, huh?

49:32.740 --> 49:34.735
What do you want? They make a
very good bouillabaisse here.

49:34.740 --> 49:38.735
They got, uh, veal,
if you're a veal guy...

49:38.740 --> 49:39.735
- Mmm. Oh, yeah, look at that.
- Mmm-hmm.

49:39.740 --> 49:41.735
We watched your movie, Rick.

49:41.740 --> 49:42.735
Sins of a Chambermaid.

49:42.740 --> 49:43.735
Wow, good.

49:43.740 --> 49:45.735
It's great that you made it for cheap,

49:45.740 --> 49:47.735
- and then you got your money back on it.
- Hmm.

49:47.740 --> 49:49.735
- Impressive.
- Thank you. Yeah.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.735
But you think with our movie

49:51.740 --> 49:54.740
that maybe we could use
actors that are better at...

49:55.740 --> 49:56.740
Acting?

49:59.740 --> 50:01.735
Also, the sets were a bit wobbly,

50:01.740 --> 50:03.735
and the costumes were...

50:03.740 --> 50:06.735
I guess, my point is, you think
that we can use two million

50:06.740 --> 50:09.740
and make a movie that turns out,

50:10.740 --> 50:11.735
I don't know...

50:11.740 --> 50:12.740
Better.

50:18.740 --> 50:22.735
You know, guys, you... You
brought me a period drama.

50:22.740 --> 50:26.735
Okay, you can make, uh,
Juno for two million,

50:26.740 --> 50:29.735
not Sense and Sensibility.
Not Atonement.

50:29.740 --> 50:31.735
I haven't seen those, have you?

50:31.740 --> 50:32.735
What was that last one?

50:32.740 --> 50:35.735
Yeah, these are movies that...
They're made by big studios.

50:35.740 --> 50:38.735
Ah! So let's get a big studio.

50:38.740 --> 50:41.735
Well, you ever tried to ask
somebody for 30 million? Hmm?

50:41.740 --> 50:42.735
It's not that simple.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.735
I managed to get us two million.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.735
What about that girl that I met at
your office, from Gravity Pictures?

50:47.740 --> 50:48.735
Uh, Ms. Quinn.

50:48.740 --> 50:50.735
April? No, no.

50:50.740 --> 50:51.735
She seemed nice.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.740
No, we're not gonna work with April.

50:54.740 --> 50:56.735
Come on, guys, huh?

50:56.740 --> 50:59.735
I helped you get the money
from the... The old lady, right?

50:59.740 --> 51:01.735
That's what I do. Let me do my job.

51:01.740 --> 51:03.735
He's got a point.

51:03.740 --> 51:06.735
But all that effort and sacrifice,
you don't wanna make any old thing.

51:06.740 --> 51:08.735
You wanna make something
that you're gonna be proud of.

51:08.740 --> 51:11.735
You know, his dad directed
Death in New Orleans.

51:11.740 --> 51:12.735
Okay.

51:12.740 --> 51:13.735
This isn't that film.

51:13.740 --> 51:14.990
But that's what I'm talking about.

51:15.053 --> 51:16.735
A film that makes you feel something.

51:16.740 --> 51:17.735
I know, I know. You
wanna feel something.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.735
That is what your dad did so well.

51:19.740 --> 51:20.735
Leave my dad out of it...

51:20.740 --> 51:22.735
- Making something of substance.
- Okay?

51:22.740 --> 51:24.735
All right, you know, good luck, guys.

51:24.740 --> 51:25.735
Because this is a mistake for me, uh...

51:25.740 --> 51:27.735
- What?
- I hope the project goes well.

51:27.740 --> 51:28.735
I'm not gonna be on it,

51:28.740 --> 51:30.735
- but I look forward to seein' it...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:30.740 --> 51:31.735
...at the local art-house cinema.

51:31.740 --> 51:33.735
I'm sure it's gonna signal a...

51:33.740 --> 51:35.735
A whole new golden age in Hollywood!

51:35.740 --> 51:36.735
Okay, what's happened? What's happening?

51:36.740 --> 51:37.735
Lose my phone number, okay?

51:37.740 --> 51:39.735
I don't know what I said... Rick...

51:39.740 --> 51:40.740
- Thank you for the drinks!
- Hold on.

52:16.740 --> 52:18.740
Hey. Is that Drew Barrymore?
