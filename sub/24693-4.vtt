00:00.699 --> 00:03.320
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.320 --> 00:06.484
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.484 --> 00:08.300
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.471

00:21.107 --> 00:24.149
I need to see you tonight.
9pm.

00:27.784 --> 00:30.507
Niko, you are home early.

00:33.546 --> 00:35.775
You don't even check his diaper, huh?

00:35.775 --> 00:37.283
Were you on the computer all day?

00:37.283 --> 00:39.770
No, no.
We just came in.

00:40.735 --> 00:42.187
You are lying.

00:42.187 --> 00:45.473
Don't lie.
Change the baby.

00:50.423 --> 00:51.863
What are you doing?
Turn that off.

00:51.863 --> 00:54.693
It's for the benefit tonight.
Ready?

00:55.684 --> 00:58.971
The Audubon Society's Honoring my
daddy for saving two Hawks

00:58.971 --> 01:01.066
- whose nest was destroyed...
- Right.

01:01.066 --> 01:03.225
I'm just really on a roll right now.

01:03.225 --> 01:06.435
But everyone wants to see you.

01:07.592 --> 01:10.061
Did you hear back from The New Yorker?

01:13.221 --> 01:16.495
Anya, what happened to your arm?
Niko?

01:16.495 --> 01:18.681
I just need a break.

01:20.355 --> 01:24.437
Be good, boy.
Tomorrow I make Babka.

01:54.450 --> 01:57.706
Can't make it tonight, sorry.

01:58.116 --> 02:00.949
- Ready for another one?
- Might as well.

02:04.304 --> 02:06.084
Is this taken?

02:06.679 --> 02:08.711
It just... freed up.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.152
And this seat?

02:12.765 --> 02:16.620
My friend and I love New York.
Are you a native?

02:16.620 --> 02:18.454
Born and Raised.

02:18.692 --> 02:20.826
Join us for a drink?

02:25.081 --> 02:27.022
Should we ask him?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.819
- You ask him.
- What?

02:28.819 --> 02:31.160
Ask me...
Ask me what?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.656
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.467
Don't tell our husbands,

02:36.467 --> 02:42.055
but we've always had this fantasy
about a three-way with a cute stranger.

02:44.268 --> 02:46.432
Okay, kiss her neck.

02:47.114 --> 02:50.519
That's it.
Keep moving.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.530
Naughty boy.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.645
Kiss her all over.

04:26.856 --> 04:28.293
Wow.

04:29.453 --> 04:34.442
Somebody spent a lot of time tying her up
before they strangled her.

04:36.697 --> 04:39.627
Didn't just tie her up.
Kinbaku.

04:39.627 --> 04:43.819
Erotic Japanese bondage
with natural jute rope.

04:43.819 --> 04:46.329
Whatever you say, Falacci.

04:46.929 --> 04:49.684
Multiple bruises here.

04:49.684 --> 04:52.106
This one's new.

04:52.383 --> 04:54.447
These are older.

04:54.447 --> 04:58.338
S&M games that went too far?
What do you think?

04:58.902 --> 05:00.801
Falacci. You with me?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.394
These earrings look like Dana Crane.

05:03.394 --> 05:05.397
If they're real, they're real emeralds.

05:05.397 --> 05:09.306
Not what a girl with cheap
shoes usually wears.

05:09.763 --> 05:13.595
Hotel manager has security footage
from the elevator.

05:15.062 --> 05:16.997
There's our Jane Doe.

05:16.997 --> 05:21.997
1:23 am.
Key card opened the room at 1:25.

05:21.997 --> 05:24.470
And the guy with the glasses her murderer?

05:24.470 --> 05:26.217
There's someone else in there with them.

05:26.217 --> 05:27.857
Rewind it, would you?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.222
She's embarrassed.

05:35.473 --> 05:38.086
Always great when drunks
make out in front of you.

05:38.086 --> 05:40.913
Come on, honey.
Show us your face.

05:43.581 --> 05:45.127
She doesn't get off with them.

05:45.127 --> 05:48.645
Well, it's gonna be tough
tracking her down based on that.

05:48.645 --> 05:49.846
Hey.

05:49.846 --> 05:51.717
Finally pulled the credit card receipt.

05:51.717 --> 05:54.118
Room was paid for by a Gerry Mitchell.

05:54.118 --> 05:55.969
He's a local.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.723
Compost is nature's
best soil amendment.

05:59.723 --> 06:01.286
Ours is manure-free.

06:01.286 --> 06:04.887
Yeah, but we're not interested
in that kinda dirt, Gerry.

06:04.887 --> 06:06.252
Where were you last night?

06:06.252 --> 06:08.739
Where I am every night...
at home, alone.

06:08.739 --> 06:13.172
Really? Your credit card was used to
check into a room at the East Houston Hotel.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.428
What? A hotel?

06:15.428 --> 06:17.294
It w... wasn't me.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.642
Uh... it's missing.

06:20.642 --> 06:23.031
I must have lost it,
or it was stolen.

06:23.031 --> 06:25.933
We checked with the company.
You didn't report it.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.016
No, I just... I just noticed it now.

06:28.016 --> 06:29.979
When was the last time you used it?

06:29.979 --> 06:31.051
Don't remember.

06:31.051 --> 06:33.936
I been a little unsettled
since my wife left.

06:33.936 --> 06:37.438
Well, then, I guess she can't verify
that you were home last night, right?

06:37.438 --> 06:42.893
I... I was playing Deathscam.
My avatar is yesterday73.

06:42.893 --> 06:45.227
You can check my game log.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.607
The hotel clerk doesn't remember
who signed the register,

06:49.607 --> 06:53.949
but she took one look at Gerry's photo
and said she's positive it wasn't him.

06:53.949 --> 06:56.366
- Because of his weight or his race?
- Both.

06:56.366 --> 07:02.054
Their clientele is all anorexic models
and euro trash named Serge.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.312
Gerry's alibi checks out.

07:04.312 --> 07:07.998
He was, uh, Deathescamming till 6:00 am.

07:07.998 --> 07:10.552
Nice life.
How about the elevator video?

07:10.552 --> 07:13.186
It's blurry, bad angle.
Placebo security.

07:13.186 --> 07:16.099
We can't ID our Jane Doe's companion.

07:16.099 --> 07:19.107
Okay. Any progress ID'ing
our Jane Doe?

07:19.107 --> 07:21.064
Her prints aren't in the system.

07:21.064 --> 07:23.502
And there's no matches
in missing persons.

07:23.502 --> 07:26.711
There is one thing, though.
Her clothes were all discount knockoffs,

07:26.711 --> 07:30.884
but the earrings are Dana Crane.
They're worth 10 grand.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.878
Makes you wonder why
the killer didn't take them.

07:51.726 --> 07:53.683
Oh, what's the matter?
No kiss.

07:53.683 --> 07:56.005
Tammy, I asked you to meet me outside.

07:56.005 --> 07:58.320
Why, is one of your
wife's friends here?

07:58.320 --> 08:00.059
I'll explain later.

08:00.426 --> 08:01.972
Let's go.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.314
Your Jane Doe died from strangulation.

08:16.314 --> 08:19.429
Tox screen showed
a few drinks, no drugs.

08:19.429 --> 08:21.939
Traces of semen in her mouth.

08:21.939 --> 08:23.649
What about the bruising, Rodgers?

08:23.649 --> 08:26.672
The one on the arm
I put several hours before death.

08:26.672 --> 08:30.047
The others are older.
Up to two weeks.

08:30.453 --> 08:33.510
Well, maybe she's in
an abusive relationship,

08:33.510 --> 08:35.541
and this time the guy couldn't stop.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.501
She's also a mother.

08:37.501 --> 08:41.015
Exam of the uterus indicates
she gave birth about 18 months ago.

08:41.015 --> 08:46.172
Well, if someone's watching her kid,
you gotta think they'll call missing persons.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.958
Yes, I'm the one who reported
Anya missing.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.600
Have you found her?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.993
When was the last time you saw her?

08:54.237 --> 08:57.416
Monday night.
I was babysitting Nikos Junior.

08:57.416 --> 09:01.291
Did Anya tell you where she was going
or who she was meeting?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.102
She told me nothing. She...

09:03.102 --> 09:05.711
She just said she needed a break.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.984
You were watching the kid.
Was there a husband?

09:07.984 --> 09:10.148
She's not married.
They live together.

09:10.148 --> 09:12.956
Nikos refuses to do the right thing.

09:12.956 --> 09:15.445
Yeah, well, where was
Nikos on Monday night?

09:15.445 --> 09:16.959
At his diner.

09:16.959 --> 09:18.667
He came home late.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.139
But you filed the report, not him.

09:21.139 --> 09:22.809
What happened to her?

09:22.809 --> 09:25.276
Did he beat Anya too?

09:31.928 --> 09:35.915
She said don't tell anyone
or he'll do it more.

09:35.915 --> 09:39.382
Okay, so, Nikos comes home,
he finds Anya gone, and...

09:39.382 --> 09:41.450
He went crazy.
He smacked me.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.911
And then he went right
to her computer.

09:43.911 --> 09:46.807
- And then he went after Anya?
- I don't know.

09:46.807 --> 09:50.927
He yelled, "Take the baby."
So I did.

09:50.927 --> 09:55.191
He misses his mother.
Why won't you tell me where...

09:58.551 --> 10:01.344
Oh, the son of a bitch.

10:06.808 --> 10:08.936
Nikos Bakalis?

10:09.130 --> 10:10.328
All right, we're police officers.

10:10.328 --> 10:12.917
We have a few questions
to ask you about Anya Pugach.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.621
- Where is she?
- Come downtown, and we'll tell you.

10:15.621 --> 10:17.547
I don't need to hear.
Please, go away.

10:17.547 --> 10:19.506
Sir, no, no, no.
Put that knife down, sir.

10:19.506 --> 10:20.734
She left.
I didn't do anything.

10:20.734 --> 10:22.222
Sir, put that knife down.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.075
This is my kitchen.
I do whatever I want.

10:24.075 --> 10:26.258
- I do whatever I want!
- Put that knife down!

10:30.482 --> 10:32.871
Put it down.
Drop the knife!

10:33.122 --> 10:36.635
And now you're under arrest.
Tell him that in Greek.

10:39.346 --> 10:41.023
Why am I here, huh?

10:41.023 --> 10:44.904
She's the one who left.
Me and my son.

10:44.904 --> 10:46.767
Also she was cheating on you, Nikos.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.898
It is no one's business.

10:49.555 --> 10:52.550
That's it.
I'm done with her.

10:53.398 --> 10:55.044
Yep.

10:57.158 --> 11:00.047
- We know.
- No.

11:00.566 --> 11:03.892
No. Anya.

11:04.234 --> 11:08.697
Sweet, beautiful girl.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.705
You loved her?

11:13.145 --> 11:16.417
Why didn't you report her missing?

11:17.932 --> 11:20.947
She's here illegally.

11:21.461 --> 11:23.115
Didn't want her to be deported.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.578
But you didn't marry her.

11:25.578 --> 11:27.916
So she couldn't leave you?

11:27.916 --> 11:32.190
You need that, Nikos?
To be in control?

11:34.279 --> 11:38.461
Did it piss you off that
she spread them for someone else?

11:42.421 --> 11:44.997
Where were you Monday night?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.791
You think I did this?

11:46.791 --> 11:49.473
No. It was her boyfriend.

11:49.473 --> 11:51.578
- What boyfriend?
- I don't know.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.351
She's always on the computer.
Hiding it from me.

11:54.351 --> 11:56.217
You need to try an alibi, Nikos.

11:56.217 --> 11:58.935
I was at my diner.
I work hard.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.993
- What time did you get home?
- I don't remember.

12:01.993 --> 12:05.320
I went home, and I stayed home.

12:06.668 --> 12:08.926
Check the tape.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.930
So Nikos's alibi holds up.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.456
He had a spy cam in the kitchen,

12:15.456 --> 12:18.615
which proves he went home
and stayed there.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.473
There he is, thanking Olga.

12:25.894 --> 12:28.498
And stayed up drinking all night.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.484
So he controlled Anya,
beat her up,

12:31.484 --> 12:32.918
but didn't kill her.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.436
If it wasn't him,
who else was in her life?

12:35.436 --> 12:37.997
Well, she's got no family in this country

12:37.997 --> 12:40.563
and Olga says she's her only friend.

12:40.563 --> 12:42.733
Nikos thought he had her
where he wanted her

12:42.733 --> 12:44.695
barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.

12:44.695 --> 12:47.869
Until she ended up dead
in the East Houston Hotel.

12:47.869 --> 12:51.269
She wouldn't be the first Ukrainian girl
to get caught up in organized crime.

12:51.269 --> 12:52.658
Look at this.

12:52.658 --> 12:55.539
Anya's computer had
a "Hide from my husband" button.

12:55.539 --> 12:59.657
When she hit F12,
the screen changed to the Kiev Weekly.

12:59.657 --> 13:02.117
- Was she talking to her boyfriend?
- Maybe.

13:02.117 --> 13:08.128
I keep finding these E-mails in her trash
from csherman@fromsonschool.edu

13:08.128 --> 13:11.600
this one... was from Monday night.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.626
Fromson. A pricey private school
on the upper east side.

13:14.626 --> 13:17.821
I wonder how Anya from the Ukraine
hooks up with that world.

13:17.821 --> 13:20.034
C. Sherman.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.934
I wonder if he bought her
those emerald earrings.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.626
This girl, we only met once in person.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.068
But I'm in a custody battle
for Wyatt, my five-year-old.

13:29.068 --> 13:31.423
I can't have my wife find out.

13:31.423 --> 13:33.997
Then you'd better keep talking.

13:34.483 --> 13:38.020
We had a few drinks, went to a hotel.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.364
Then she asked for money
for her sick relatives.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.623
I said I couldn't help her.
Never saw her again.

13:42.623 --> 13:44.696
- When was that?
- Six weeks ago.

13:44.696 --> 13:47.116
But you've continued to e-mail her.

13:47.116 --> 13:52.306
These e-mails to her, they're all from
csherman@fromsonschool.edu.

13:52.306 --> 13:54.466
- That's you, right? / Well, yeah.
- Chris Sherman.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.943
But I didn't write these.
I never use all lower case.

13:57.943 --> 14:00.202
And this week where
there are five messages...

14:00.202 --> 14:03.171
I was camping in the Adirondacks
with Wyatt and two other families.

14:03.171 --> 14:05.575
There's no WiFi up there.

14:05.575 --> 14:07.277
Does anybody know your password?

14:07.277 --> 14:09.781
- I'm very careful.
- Maybe they guessed?

14:09.781 --> 14:13.238
Could it be...
"Wyatt's dad"?

14:13.642 --> 14:17.159
So what's the name of the website
where you met Anya?

14:17.159 --> 14:20.035
Marriedbutsolonely.com

14:20.035 --> 14:21.856
It was a mistake.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.954
All right. Thanks.

14:25.796 --> 14:30.152
Asking for money for sick relatives.
Anya was a real pro.

14:30.152 --> 14:34.483
She hijacked his e-mail address
so client could contact her anonymously.

14:34.897 --> 14:38.524
"marriedbutsolonely.com"?
That's half of New Jersey.

14:38.524 --> 14:42.822
426 men within 50 miles
of the lower east side.

14:42.822 --> 14:45.126
We did a little matchmaking of our own

14:45.126 --> 14:49.001
with the security video
from the East Houston Hotel elevator.

14:49.001 --> 14:51.625
You see the bottom edge
of this dark strip here?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.760
His head is about four inches below it.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.580
That makes him about 5'8".

14:55.580 --> 14:57.796
You gonna use height?
Every man lies about that.

14:57.796 --> 15:01.315
We factored in the traditional male 2" lie.

15:01.315 --> 15:05.037
We're looking at guys who are 5'10".

15:05.277 --> 15:06.811
95.

15:06.811 --> 15:10.566
Caucasian... receding hairline.

15:10.566 --> 15:12.183
Not that anyone's gonna highlight that.

15:12.183 --> 15:14.611
Well, six of them couldn't help it,

15:14.611 --> 15:18.601
including two who also wear glasses.

15:18.601 --> 15:21.864
Our elevator make-out man
wears square black frames.

15:21.864 --> 15:26.942
We think we have our match.
Screen name Lonelyman.

15:26.942 --> 15:28.462
A writer.

15:28.462 --> 15:31.456
They always pose like that.
Hides the double chin.

15:31.456 --> 15:32.958
According to his profile,

15:32.958 --> 15:36.515
he's had one short story published
by the Red Moon press

15:36.515 --> 15:41.006
and a new collection being considered
by a major publisher.

15:41.006 --> 15:44.979
Translation, Lonelyman
has lots of time on his hands.

15:44.979 --> 15:48.798
Track him down.
Find out how he spent it Monday night.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.446
Hey, who knew short story
writing paid so well?

15:52.446 --> 15:54.410
Detectives?

15:55.019 --> 15:58.109
My housekeeper told me
you're looking for my husband.

15:58.109 --> 16:00.371
He's not here right now.
Can I help you?

16:00.371 --> 16:03.198
We need to ask him a few questions.

16:03.883 --> 16:06.756
- Is in Noah in some kind of trouble?
- Well, a friend of his may be.

16:06.756 --> 16:10.099
Can you tell us where
Noah was on Monday night?

16:10.099 --> 16:13.562
Writing. As usual.

16:13.562 --> 16:15.959
I'm sure he's not involved
in any criminal matter.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.149
He's on a deadline.

16:17.149 --> 16:19.562
Well, this may have something
to do with his research.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.659
Can see how.

16:20.659 --> 16:25.923
He's working on a collection of short stories
about the desolate and forlorn.

16:25.923 --> 16:29.140
There must be some mistake.
I'm running late.

16:29.140 --> 16:32.498
Is that a Dana Crane bracelet?

16:32.498 --> 16:35.352
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, wow. I love her stuff.

16:35.352 --> 16:40.311
Doesn't she make a matching earring
with emeralds?

16:40.311 --> 16:43.997
Yes, actually, I own them...
or used to.

16:43.997 --> 16:45.905
I just noticed they're missing.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.773
Are these your earrings?

16:52.266 --> 16:54.777
She may have crossed
paths with your husband.

16:54.777 --> 16:57.518
Now, our concern is that
whoever did this to her

16:57.518 --> 17:00.191
is looking for your husband next.

17:00.191 --> 17:02.962
We keep a studio in the village.

17:02.962 --> 17:04.686
He uses it for writing.
I'll call him.

17:04.686 --> 17:07.402
No, don't.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.983
Noah Brezner.
NYPD.

17:12.983 --> 17:14.339
Just a second.

17:14.339 --> 17:17.369
Open the door, Mr. Brezner. now.

17:17.679 --> 17:19.284
- Hey, Noah.
- Hey.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.678
How's the writing going?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.730
What's this about?

17:26.730 --> 17:29.161
We'll explain it downtown.

17:29.634 --> 17:34.629
She's um... my copy editor.
We're working.

17:36.416 --> 17:39.126
My short story collection is
called Lonleyville.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.722
It explores the price we pay for love.

17:41.722 --> 17:44.979
You mean it's about married men
who wanna get laid.

17:44.979 --> 17:49.903
Some of my stories depict
spouses with yearnings, yes.

17:49.903 --> 17:56.016
Is that why you had a profile
on marriedbutsolonely.com?

17:56.232 --> 17:59.727
You know, I still don't know
what this is about.

18:03.046 --> 18:05.086
Recognize these?

18:07.148 --> 18:08.553
Your wife did.

18:08.553 --> 18:12.255
We found them on a dead girl
in the East Houston Hotel.

18:12.255 --> 18:16.453
And you're on a security video,
kissing her.

18:16.711 --> 18:19.354
And now that we have your prints.

18:19.354 --> 18:22.831
We're gonna find them
on the victim, too, right Noah?

18:25.948 --> 18:27.488
Okay.

18:28.205 --> 18:30.080
I was at a bar.
I had a few drinks.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.096
I'm a writer, I drink.

18:32.096 --> 18:35.516
These two women sat next to me
one a blonde with an accent.

18:35.516 --> 18:37.269
They said they were
leaving town tomorrow.

18:37.269 --> 18:40.968
Back on a plane to their husbands
and kids in Shaker Heights.

18:40.968 --> 18:45.808
We all got a little drunk,
and then they invited me to their hotel.

18:46.106 --> 18:48.373
Sorry. And then what happened?

18:48.373 --> 18:50.484
I don't know.

18:50.484 --> 18:52.917
I remember kissing the blonde,
but that's it.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.270
They must have drugged me.

18:54.270 --> 18:56.662
Next thing I knew,
I woke up with a dead woman.

18:56.662 --> 19:00.180
So I just bolted, just ran home.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.291
Hey. Is this the blonde woman?

19:03.291 --> 19:04.862
Yeah.

19:04.862 --> 19:08.473
And what about the other one?
Remember anything about her?

19:08.473 --> 19:10.469
Brown hair.

19:10.469 --> 19:14.326
Nice figure.
Uh, she was friendly.

19:14.326 --> 19:17.145
Uh, and she was gone when I woke up.

19:17.145 --> 19:20.049
- Can anyone verify any of this?
- The bartender.

19:20.049 --> 19:22.371
The bar on Ludlow Street.
He saw me with both of them.

19:22.371 --> 19:25.289
- Just ask him.
- Oh, we'll do that.

19:26.773 --> 19:28.578
Okay.

19:30.841 --> 19:32.691
So, uh, I can go now?

19:32.691 --> 19:36.088
No. Not yet.
You're under arrest.

19:36.088 --> 19:37.629
For what?

19:38.912 --> 19:40.498
Murder.

19:44.196 --> 19:45.959
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.418
Uh, single malt.

19:47.418 --> 19:49.492
We talked about the creative process.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.437
Anyone else with him?

19:51.992 --> 19:53.985
Lychee martini.

19:54.209 --> 19:57.468
Very blonde.
Eastern European accent.

19:57.468 --> 19:58.669
You got a good memory.

19:58.669 --> 20:01.223
I'm an actor.
And a writer.

20:01.223 --> 20:04.782
So single malt and the Lychee martini.

20:04.782 --> 20:06.508
You happen to catch their conversation?

20:06.508 --> 20:09.546
I didn't have to.
I've seen that a thousand times, man.

20:09.546 --> 20:11.007
The three drink hookup?

20:11.007 --> 20:12.863
Blonde had her room card on the bar.

20:12.863 --> 20:16.135
What about the other woman
they left the bar with?

20:16.135 --> 20:17.870
The brunette?

20:17.870 --> 20:19.370
What other woman?

20:19.370 --> 20:21.112
No, no, it was just the two of them.

20:21.112 --> 20:24.191
Guy was grinning like he hit the jackpot.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.969
Sorry. It's my wife.

20:28.596 --> 20:31.908
Then the bartender is lying.
He must be in on it.

20:31.908 --> 20:33.373
You mean he slipped you a Mickey?

20:33.373 --> 20:35.459
Maybe that's why I can't remember.

20:35.459 --> 20:38.477
You know, I hear bad alibis every day.

20:38.477 --> 20:41.748
But you're a writer. I expected
something a little better from you.

20:41.748 --> 20:43.102
No.

20:43.102 --> 20:45.824
There were two women.

20:46.120 --> 20:51.665
Someone... at the hotel must have seen us
in the lobby, in the elevator.

20:51.665 --> 20:54.625
We did see a second woman
on the elevator.

20:54.625 --> 20:57.878
- You see?
- But only Anya got off with you.

20:57.878 --> 20:59.182
Is that where you got the idea?

20:59.182 --> 21:00.937
No, the other woman, the brunette...

21:00.937 --> 21:03.679
The one whose name
you don't remember.

21:04.139 --> 21:09.220
She said she had to go to her room
and call her husband.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.470
Officer.

21:12.378 --> 21:14.650
Wait. Stop.

21:20.425 --> 21:22.352
I'm being blackmailed.

21:22.554 --> 21:24.170
By the mystery brunette?

21:24.170 --> 21:26.216
I don't know. Maybe.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.355
The morning that I woke up,

21:28.355 --> 21:33.629
there was a photo of me and the dead girl,
and she was all tied up.

21:33.629 --> 21:34.940
You into that, Noah?

21:34.940 --> 21:38.005
No. I grabbed the photo and cut out.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.341
A few hours later, a woman called
and said she had videotaped us.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.391
She wanted 200,000 in cash.

21:43.391 --> 21:45.289
So you're saying
the whole thing's a setup...

21:45.289 --> 21:47.165
The girls, the drinks, the hotel.

21:47.165 --> 21:49.542
I am a patsy, not a killer.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.111
Good rewrite.
Any proof?

21:52.111 --> 21:55.158
I told my girlfriend, Tammy Mills.

21:55.158 --> 21:58.028
The one you found me with.
She's not really a copy editor.

21:58.028 --> 21:59.211
You're kidding.

21:59.211 --> 22:02.554
I was supposed to meet Tammy that night,
but she cancelled.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.343
So you consoled yourself
with a three-way?

22:05.343 --> 22:06.738
I got drunk.

22:06.738 --> 22:10.178
I never would have cheated
on Tammy otherwise.

22:10.178 --> 22:13.374
You told your girlfriend that you woke up
next to a dead woman?

22:13.374 --> 22:14.684
I never lie to Tammy.

22:14.684 --> 22:17.026
Just to your wife.
And us.

22:17.026 --> 22:20.934
I didn't think you would believe me.
The photo makes me look guilty.

22:20.934 --> 22:22.218
So you threw it away.

22:22.218 --> 22:23.541
No, I saved it.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.966
It's in my writing atelier.

22:25.966 --> 22:27.117
Atelier?

22:27.117 --> 22:29.358
You mean the studio your wife bought?
We already searched that.

22:29.358 --> 22:31.707
You looked through
every manuscript? Huh?

22:31.707 --> 22:36.404
It is tucked in the fifth draft
on the bookshelf behind my desk.

22:36.404 --> 22:38.973
It's next to the Raymond Carver.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.897
Here's the Carver.

22:42.897 --> 22:44.312
Hey.

22:46.810 --> 22:50.137
"What we talk about
when we talk about love."

22:50.137 --> 22:52.831
I'll put it right on my list.

22:53.542 --> 22:57.813
And here's Lonelyville.
Fifth draft.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.641
But no photo.

23:00.907 --> 23:04.202
- Surprised?
- Falacci.

23:04.202 --> 23:07.720
Look at these ropes on the dead plants.

23:14.954 --> 23:17.477
Natural jute?

23:17.477 --> 23:19.900
Oh, this guy wants to get punished.

23:19.900 --> 23:25.389
Lab says that Noah's houseplants
had the same Kinbaku rope
found at the crime scene.

23:25.389 --> 23:28.140
But wasn't it Noah who sent
you back to his studio?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.372
You mean his atelier?

23:30.372 --> 23:34.749
Yep. He said we'd find the photo
that would verify his blackmail story.

23:34.749 --> 23:36.307
Which we didn't.

23:36.307 --> 23:39.675
Coffee, light, two sugars.

23:39.675 --> 23:41.167
Cream?

23:41.544 --> 23:43.098
Milk.

23:43.098 --> 23:45.388
Tough it out, Falacci.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.525
So this guy sends us up there.

23:48.525 --> 23:51.180
Why would he set himself up?

23:51.433 --> 23:55.076
Maybe he's just vamping until his wife's
money buys him reasonable doubt.

23:55.076 --> 23:56.826
Vamping? He's a flailing.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.629
She won't even post his bail.

23:58.629 --> 24:01.442
Turns out he's already
dipped into their funds.

24:01.442 --> 24:04.745
200,000 out of their money market.

24:04.745 --> 24:07.818
Which is the exact amount
he claims he was blackmailed for.

24:07.818 --> 24:09.432
You don't really buy into this.

24:09.432 --> 24:14.157
Come on, elevator video.
Bartender testimony. Prints.

24:14.157 --> 24:16.624
We're waiting for his DNA,
but we don't even need it.

24:16.624 --> 24:20.413
In my experience, guilty guys
make up believable lies.

24:20.413 --> 24:24.854
What, like a one-armed man
burst into the room and threw me out?

24:24.854 --> 24:28.670
Yeah, like that, Falacci.
Exactly.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.393
You talk to Hemingway's girlfriend?

24:30.393 --> 24:32.964
Oh, Tammy Mills? Yeah.
She's on her way in.

24:32.964 --> 24:36.017
Come on, that's a waste of time.
She's just gonna lie to save him.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.099
She's his last hope.

24:38.405 --> 24:40.495
See if you can trip her up.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.205
You're trying to trick me.
We were together all night.

24:45.205 --> 24:48.286
Detectives, why are you questioning
my client without her lawyer?

24:48.286 --> 24:49.663
Oh, you're just in time.

24:49.663 --> 24:53.067
She was in the middle of obstructing
justice and hindering a murder investigation.

24:53.067 --> 24:56.120
Back off.
We need a moment.

25:03.182 --> 25:07.450
We're on track now, Detectives.
Isn't that right, Tammy?

25:07.748 --> 25:11.183
I... I was supposed
to see Noah that Monday,

25:11.183 --> 25:14.010
but I texted him and told him
I couldn't make it.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.783
He texted back and said
he was gonna write.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.307
Here.

25:18.307 --> 25:20.603
It's all in my cell.

25:21.689 --> 25:23.014
Did he call you the next day?

25:23.014 --> 25:25.809
Yes. He said he missed me.

25:26.797 --> 25:28.899
He tell you how his night went?

25:28.899 --> 25:31.291
He said his writing went well.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.793
Did he mention he woke up
next to a corpse?

25:34.793 --> 25:38.725
What? / My client has no idea
what you're referring to.

25:38.725 --> 25:40.512
When's the last time you spoke to him?

25:40.512 --> 25:42.753
Well, it's been hard
to talk over the phone.

25:42.753 --> 25:46.880
He wanted me to visit, but I figured
I'd just see him later today.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.101
That's still all right, isn't it?

25:49.431 --> 25:56.536
Ms. Mills, are you saying Noah didn't say
anything to you about being blackmailed?

25:56.536 --> 25:58.760
About a photograph?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.471
What photograph?

26:00.471 --> 26:03.300
Did he say anything about needing money?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.743
Oh.

26:04.983 --> 26:07.390
You found out about that.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.538
Well, we'd like to hear your side.

26:13.745 --> 26:15.910
Go ahead, Tammy.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.705
Noah's marriage was over.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.243
He was gonna borrow
some money from their savings

26:22.243 --> 26:25.222
so we could get away
and make a fresh start.

26:25.222 --> 26:28.258
How much does a fresh start cost?

26:28.494 --> 26:31.100
He said up to 200,000.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.798
His wife wouldn't need to cosign.

26:35.948 --> 26:37.181
I don't understand.

26:37.181 --> 26:40.096
Try this: No one's backing you up.

26:40.096 --> 26:41.354
Not even your girlfriend.

26:41.354 --> 26:44.210
She did say you were
stealing from your wife.

26:44.210 --> 26:47.845
200 grand so that you and Tammy
could start a new life together.

26:47.845 --> 26:51.125
No, I already told you.
I took the money to pay the blackmailer.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.728
Tammy was there outside
when I made the drop.

26:53.728 --> 26:55.940
This doesn't make any sense.

26:58.898 --> 27:00.785
So Noah...

27:03.747 --> 27:06.511
- How well did you know Tammy?
- We're soul mates.

27:06.511 --> 27:08.910
I thought I was happily
married until I met her.

27:08.910 --> 27:11.329
- How long ago was that?
- About two months.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.609
We made an instant connection.
Speed dating.

27:13.609 --> 27:14.959
More research?

27:14.959 --> 27:16.512
It was for authenticity.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.748
Like you were researching Kinbaku.

27:18.748 --> 27:20.652
Hold on a second.

27:20.652 --> 27:22.419
See, here's the problem.

27:22.419 --> 27:24.208
We went back to your studio, Noah,

27:24.208 --> 27:26.968
and we found the same jute
that strangled Anya Pugach.

27:26.968 --> 27:29.097
That's impossible.

27:29.097 --> 27:31.456
The blackmailer must have planted it!

27:31.456 --> 27:35.165
Well, was that before or after
she took away the photo?

27:35.395 --> 27:37.723
We checked your manuscript.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.723
Nothing there.

27:43.199 --> 27:45.261
Then... it's Tammy.

27:45.261 --> 27:47.711
See, she's scared.

27:48.028 --> 27:51.387
Let me... let me talk to her.
She will tell the truth.

27:51.387 --> 27:53.806
We gave her every chance.

27:54.576 --> 27:57.818
Get me to a phone, please.

27:58.191 --> 28:01.665
Tammy, it's me.
I need you to tell the truth now.

28:01.665 --> 28:05.226
I love you, mew mew.
Just don't be afraid.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.967
I'm gonna hand the phone
over to the detectives.

28:08.967 --> 28:11.389
No. You don't need to lie anymore.

28:11.389 --> 28:13.943
I need you to... Tammy?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.476
Wait... Tammy?

28:15.476 --> 28:17.394
Please.

28:21.112 --> 28:25.466
She hung up on me.
I... I don't understand.

28:26.189 --> 28:28.385
She hung up on me.

28:30.607 --> 28:33.001
Noah sounded so upset.

28:33.001 --> 28:35.484
Guilty conscience.

28:35.718 --> 28:37.298
Honey.

28:38.373 --> 28:40.831
It's gonna be okay.

28:43.427 --> 28:48.065
God, I want you.

28:58.584 --> 29:01.436
We have DNA results
for the semen found on Anya.

29:01.436 --> 29:03.339
It's a match for Noah.

29:03.339 --> 29:06.257
Guy's not having a good day.
His rich wife's divorcing him.

29:06.257 --> 29:10.954
His girlfriend says he's lying,
and his DNA's in a dead Ukrainian.

29:10.954 --> 29:14.917
Yeah, well, if he is a mark,
someone did a real number on him.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.234
A mark? What, are you working
for legal aid now? / Ross

29:18.234 --> 29:20.825
You can't still believe
the guy's innocent.

29:20.825 --> 29:22.438
Thank you.

29:23.885 --> 29:27.249
That was the watch commander at Rikers.

29:27.249 --> 29:30.476
Noah Brezner just killed himself.

29:40.457 --> 29:42.908
Cause of death, strangulation.

29:42.908 --> 29:48.592
He hanged himself with a torn bed sheet
tied to the bars of his cell window.

29:48.592 --> 29:50.563
Yeah, but what about these marks here?

29:50.563 --> 29:53.776
My best guess...
he made three attempts.

29:53.776 --> 29:55.701
The first two knots didn't hold?

29:55.701 --> 29:57.241
Apparently not.

29:57.241 --> 29:58.802
What happened to his foot?

29:58.802 --> 30:03.007
Broke two bones.
Probably on one of the early attempts.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.867
Guy couldn't even tie a knot.

30:05.867 --> 30:08.852
Sound like a Kinbaku master?

30:10.420 --> 30:13.540
Sad suicide note.
Not an angry one.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.284
I looked over the case.
Arresting him was the right call.

30:16.284 --> 30:18.898
For now, say Noah was framed.

30:18.898 --> 30:21.273
Tammy denied his story.
She could be in on it.

30:21.273 --> 30:22.909
- What do we know about her?
- Not much.

30:22.909 --> 30:24.266
She's separated.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.767
Moved here from Des Moines
six months ago.

30:26.767 --> 30:28.907
- Talk to the husband?
- Took a while.

30:28.907 --> 30:31.016
He's on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.

30:31.016 --> 30:34.883
According to him, when he took the job,
Tammy felt abandoned,

30:34.883 --> 30:37.561
began an online romance.

30:37.561 --> 30:41.440
"Lee, I'm so crazy happy I found you."

30:41.440 --> 30:44.675
Her husband found the e-mails.
She left and moved to New York.

30:44.675 --> 30:46.015
To be with Lee?

30:46.015 --> 30:49.585
Who knows?
The e-mail address dead ends.

30:49.585 --> 30:52.799
If she was part of a blackmail ring,
she set up the date.

30:52.799 --> 30:55.635
Anya and the brunette
came in to close it.

30:55.942 --> 30:58.591
How did Tammy and Noah meet?

31:00.754 --> 31:02.571
I remember her.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.990
And OPD... overly picky dater.

31:04.990 --> 31:08.630
All the guys would check her box,
but she only chose one a night.

31:09.104 --> 31:10.734
Six minutes up.

31:10.734 --> 31:13.073
Who did Tammy check?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.140
Here's the last one.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.613
Anyone before that?

31:20.818 --> 31:22.509
This man.

31:22.509 --> 31:25.007
Why him, I don't know.
He was so depressed.

31:25.007 --> 31:26.339
Remember him, Falacci?

31:26.339 --> 31:30.160
The manure-free composter,
Gerry Mitchell.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.448
Maybe he didn't lose his credit card.

31:32.448 --> 31:34.901
Okay. I tried speed dating.

31:34.901 --> 31:38.385
She might have been one of
the ten women I met for six minutes.

31:38.385 --> 31:41.295
But I didn't hook up.
I'm trying to get back with my wife.

31:41.295 --> 31:45.249
Then you probably don't want her to know
that you're involved in an extortion ring.

31:45.249 --> 31:46.180
What?

31:46.180 --> 31:50.422
This video spy cam
charged to your credit card?

31:50.422 --> 31:52.218
Sex, lies, and videotape.

31:52.218 --> 31:55.745
You didn't exactly lose your card,
did you, Gerry?

31:55.745 --> 31:57.300
Okay.

31:57.300 --> 32:00.504
Tammy... now, I thought
she understood my sadness.

32:00.504 --> 32:04.105
But she came over once,
and then my credit card was gone.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.912
And you didn't report this because...

32:05.912 --> 32:08.890
Because she was gonna show
the videotape to my wife.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.914
Now what was I supposed to do?

32:10.914 --> 32:13.440
I want my marriage back.

32:14.918 --> 32:18.218
Tammy and her partners
seduce and video married men,

32:18.218 --> 32:19.668
then blackmail them?

32:19.668 --> 32:21.816
Gerry Mitchell.
He was the first mark.

32:21.816 --> 32:22.970
Stole his credit card.

32:22.970 --> 32:25.988
Next up, Chris Sherman.
School accountant.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.918
They took him for 10 grand,
hijacked his e-mail account

32:28.918 --> 32:30.114
so he'd keep quiet.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.190
Used that to coordinate Anya's hookups.

32:32.190 --> 32:34.944
I'm confused.
Was Anya an accomplice or a victim?

32:34.944 --> 32:37.805
Well, we think victim.
We went back to see Olga,

32:37.805 --> 32:40.221
and she showed us this photo.

32:40.221 --> 32:45.003
Anya had given it to Olga just in case
anything ever happened to her.

32:45.003 --> 32:47.137
Anya must have been
cheating on Nikos.

32:47.137 --> 32:49.825
They taped it, then they
threatened to tell that maniac.

32:49.825 --> 32:52.087
And forced her into prostitution.

32:52.087 --> 32:53.497
Brutal.

32:53.497 --> 32:56.232
So Tammy from Des Moines
is the ringleader?

32:56.232 --> 32:57.623
Who's pulling her strings?

32:57.623 --> 32:59.847
The only lead we have
is the second woman,

32:59.847 --> 33:01.926
the brunette that Noah
said he met in the bar.

33:01.926 --> 33:06.765
Except the bartender told us
it was just Noah and Anya that night.

33:06.765 --> 33:09.969
Newsflash, the bartender's
being blackmailed too.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.219
I'll be right there, honey.

33:15.544 --> 33:18.338
Nice family. / Yeah, we're going
to the Global warming rally.

33:18.338 --> 33:20.487
Okay, then I'll make this quick.

33:20.686 --> 33:22.161
You lied to us.

33:22.161 --> 33:24.491
Tell us the truth.
Your wife will never know.

33:24.491 --> 33:27.137
And then you're free
to save the planet.

33:27.417 --> 33:30.059
Hey, Patrick, work with us.

33:30.059 --> 33:33.430
Otherwise, you're gonna be looking
over your shoulder for the rest of your life.

33:33.430 --> 33:36.338
Worrying every time the phone rings.

33:37.004 --> 33:38.720
I had to lie.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.812
So there were two women at the bar
Monday night talking to the writer.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.751
He left with both of them.

33:43.751 --> 33:46.172
The second woman
came back the next day,

33:46.172 --> 33:48.381
convinced me not to talk to the cops.

33:48.381 --> 33:49.885
Can you describe the second woman?

33:49.885 --> 33:51.306
You can see for yourself.

33:51.306 --> 33:54.727
My daughter came home from preschool
with an envelope.

33:54.727 --> 33:56.763
Had a DVD in it.

33:57.874 --> 34:02.298
Okay. That's more of Patrick
than I wanted to see.

34:02.298 --> 34:03.639
Where's the woman?

34:03.639 --> 34:06.173
He'll flip her over any second.

34:06.867 --> 34:10.857
If he's cheating on his wife,
he's not going missionary the whole way.

34:13.811 --> 34:15.474
Wait a second.

34:15.474 --> 34:17.210
Rewind it.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.860
Slow it down.

34:21.507 --> 34:22.913
Freeze.

34:23.117 --> 34:24.594
Now zoom it in.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.976
Isn't that Tammy's lawyer?

34:34.487 --> 34:36.503
Leanne Baker.

34:36.503 --> 34:41.047
A blackmailing con artist
and possible murderer.

34:41.047 --> 34:44.928
A new low even for a lawyer.
If she really is a lawyer.

34:44.928 --> 34:47.460
Yeah. She passed the bar ten years ago,

34:47.460 --> 34:50.012
started out at a top firm.
Bounced around.

34:50.012 --> 34:53.507
Ended up posting bail
for low-level drug dealers.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.164
Last year, she got fired
for sexual harassment.

34:56.164 --> 35:00.136
Apparently, she was hitting
on her female secretary.

35:00.136 --> 35:03.584
So Leanne isn't just Tammy's lawyer.

35:03.584 --> 35:06.553
She's the Lee that Tammy
left her husband for.

35:06.553 --> 35:11.002
None of her e-mails to Tammy
specified gender. Bait and switch.

35:11.002 --> 35:14.720
Pretty cocky to walk into a major case
when you're leading the scam.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.490
Hey, it's not just cocky, it's smart.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.568
If we question Leanne,
she can claim lawyer client privilege.

35:20.568 --> 35:24.703
And if they are lovers,
Leanne knows Tammy won't turn on her.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.814
Maybe.

35:27.814 --> 35:31.272
Maybe not. I'll put a call
into the DA. Once he signs off,

35:31.272 --> 35:34.156
we'll pull Tammy in for a lineup.

35:34.156 --> 35:37.791
Let's see how hard it is
to con a con artist.

35:38.382 --> 35:41.607
- Your witness is late.
- He's on the way.

35:48.262 --> 35:49.805
Coffee, counselor?

35:49.805 --> 35:52.873
- I'll pass.
- It's free.

35:54.355 --> 35:57.156
You'll be looking through this window.

35:57.940 --> 36:02.389
Do you recognize any of these women
from your bar on Monday night?

36:03.121 --> 36:05.431
Yes, number two.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.521
You sure it's her?
Take your time.

36:08.521 --> 36:10.566
She was with the other
blonde and the writer.

36:10.566 --> 36:13.456
Uh, three Martinis.
She paid for the drinks.

36:15.576 --> 36:17.288
Thank you.

36:20.207 --> 36:24.649
We'll be arresting your client
for the murder of Anya Pugach.

36:28.370 --> 36:31.179
This is ridiculous.
He was lying.

36:31.179 --> 36:33.911
I heard bartenders don't lie.

36:37.171 --> 36:38.915
Now, just relax.

36:39.826 --> 36:41.873
It's just I...
I wasn't at the bar.

36:41.873 --> 36:43.660
I was at home texting Noah.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.520
Not according to the bartender.
He said he saw you at the bar.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.012
Noah would have said
it was me if it was me.

36:50.012 --> 36:52.288
Unless you're the murderer
and he was protecting you.

36:52.288 --> 36:54.313
But I wasn't there.

36:54.313 --> 36:57.094
And Noah killed Anya.

36:57.376 --> 36:59.539
Is that what he said?

36:59.539 --> 37:04.106
Um, I just assumed.
I mean, you arrested him.

37:04.407 --> 37:07.203
Noah seem like a killer to you?

37:07.443 --> 37:10.480
No. He was always gentle with me.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.842
You're not a very good
judge of character, Tammy.

37:12.842 --> 37:14.970
Even now, these two aren't your friends.

37:14.970 --> 37:18.000
- You need to stop talking.
- Suit yourself.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.247
Holding's right this way.

37:27.438 --> 37:30.106
- I have to go in there?
- Just till I post bail.

37:30.106 --> 37:31.520
Well, good luck.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.094
High-profile case,
brutality of the murder.

37:34.094 --> 37:36.516
DA's recommending no bail.

37:36.729 --> 37:38.020
I can not go in there.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.661
Well, if you have more to tell us...

37:39.661 --> 37:41.768
She has nothing more to tell you.

37:42.447 --> 37:44.820
How did you know Noah wasn't guilty?

37:44.820 --> 37:46.892
It was the way he committed suicide.

37:46.892 --> 37:49.694
He hanged himself.
But it took him three tries.

37:49.694 --> 37:52.477
Turns out Noah couldn't tie a knot.

37:52.477 --> 37:57.427
But Anya... she was
bound and strangled.

37:57.427 --> 38:03.200
The killer planted this rope
in Noah's studio to frame him.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.204
Oh, my God. Anya.

38:05.204 --> 38:06.485
Tammy, don't look at that.

38:06.485 --> 38:10.172
Noah told us he gave you
a key to his studio.

38:10.172 --> 38:11.965
These your ropes?

38:11.965 --> 38:13.221
It wasn't me.

38:13.221 --> 38:15.093
Maybe someone took your keys?

38:15.093 --> 38:17.544
Noah killed himself
because he was so guilty.

38:17.544 --> 38:21.411
No, actually, it was because
he was heartbroken over you.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.624
He wrote you a note.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.966
Read it.

38:28.552 --> 38:30.464
"Mew, mew,"

38:31.199 --> 38:34.413
"I tried to understand
why you betrayed me."

38:34.413 --> 38:37.593
"I know there must be a reason."

38:37.593 --> 38:38.851
It's fake, Tammy.

38:38.851 --> 38:42.982
No, it's not. It's his writing.
I recognize it.

38:43.217 --> 38:46.302
Mew mew.
That's my nickname.

38:46.302 --> 38:48.959
- Said I was his muse.
- You were...

38:48.959 --> 38:52.214
and, apparently, he didn't want to live
if you didn't love him.

38:52.214 --> 38:54.236
- It's my fault.
- Yeah.

38:54.236 --> 38:57.509
You knew about the blackmail,
and you lied to us.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.027
Don't listen to her, Tammy.

38:59.027 --> 39:01.529
Why did you lie, Tammy?

39:01.529 --> 39:06.110
Because Leanne told you to?
Or is it Lee?

39:10.087 --> 39:15.445
Listen to me.
I'm on your side, not them.

39:15.934 --> 39:17.502
Your side?

39:17.502 --> 39:20.843
She made you sleep
with Anya, with Gerry, with Noah.

39:20.843 --> 39:23.880
Now you're going to jail,
and she has the money.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.147
Tammy, that's blood money.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.105
Oh, no. No one was
ever supposed to die.

39:30.105 --> 39:32.704
That was never the plan.
Just tell them, Leanne.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.043
What you're doing is highly unethical.

39:35.043 --> 39:36.503
Staging lineups?

39:36.503 --> 39:39.165
Pitting a client against her lawyer?

39:39.165 --> 39:42.627
How did you know it was a false ID?

39:44.907 --> 39:47.050
We've got a lawyer waiting for you in case

39:47.050 --> 39:51.578
you think that Leanne is
no longer serving your interests.

39:55.039 --> 39:59.404
I did everything you told me
because I believed that you loved me.

39:59.844 --> 40:02.785
They were gonna film Noah
with the two of them,

40:02.785 --> 40:05.639
then threaten to send it to his wife.

40:05.944 --> 40:08.805
You started to like Noah, didn't you?

40:09.842 --> 40:12.672
It's been a tough slide
for you, huh, Leanne?

40:12.672 --> 40:14.119
I have no idea what you mean.

40:14.119 --> 40:18.220
Graduating with honors.
Passing the bar on your first try.

40:18.220 --> 40:21.061
Then what happened?
Drugs? Booze?

40:21.061 --> 40:23.212
- You don't know me.
- We know this, Counselor.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.715
Your career has sunk like a rock.

40:25.715 --> 40:29.427
Four firms in eight years.
Two stints in rehab.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.430
A sexual harassment suit.
Career over.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.700
Plan "B"...
Con Tammy.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.593
And then you come up
with this blackmailing scheme.

40:36.593 --> 40:38.563
You can't prove any of this.

40:38.563 --> 40:40.303
You were in control.

40:40.303 --> 40:44.333
Your own boss.
Till Tammy went soft.

40:44.333 --> 40:47.893
She was gonna let Noah off the hook,
you big fish.

40:47.893 --> 40:49.361
You're getting older.

40:49.361 --> 40:52.333
How much longer are you gonna
be able to play men for sex?

40:52.333 --> 40:54.535
You tell me, honey.

40:55.098 --> 40:58.242
Threaten Noah's marriage.
That's risky.

40:58.242 --> 41:01.740
But extort him for murder...
that's worth 200,000.

41:01.740 --> 41:03.836
His death is on you, not me.

41:03.836 --> 41:07.003
Yeah, but Anya. Her murder.

41:07.003 --> 41:09.392
That's all you.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.912
How could you kill Anya?

41:12.912 --> 41:14.647
God, she was so sweet.

41:14.647 --> 41:17.902
- She was a whore.
- I liked her.

41:17.902 --> 41:21.365
Good Lord, Tammy.
Who don't you like?

41:21.365 --> 41:23.317
I wouldn't have had to do any of this

41:23.317 --> 41:26.052
if you had just done your job with Noah.

41:26.052 --> 41:28.688
You were supposed to sit in his lap,
take off his glasses,

41:28.688 --> 41:30.799
and unzip his pants.

41:30.799 --> 41:33.552
Not get him to fall in love with you.

41:33.552 --> 41:38.218
He did love me.
He was the only one.

41:39.733 --> 41:42.312
You are pathetic.

41:43.636 --> 41:48.631
Leanne Baker, you're under arrest
for the murder of Anya Pugach.

41:49.326 --> 41:52.073
You need everyone to love you.

41:52.073 --> 41:54.585
Now what do you have?

41:55.717 --> 41:57.613
Nothing.
