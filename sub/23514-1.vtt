00:38.042 --> 00:42.167
Far, far to the north
lies an unforgiving land,

00:42.833 --> 00:48.250
where the nights last several moons,
and the winters are cruel.

00:51.792 --> 00:55.000
This is the land of the Vikings.

00:56.417 --> 01:00.667
Here, fierce chieftains lead
their mighty warriors to battle.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.250
Hello?

01:39.583 --> 01:42.167
Anybody home?

01:43.542 --> 01:45.792
By Thor!

01:57.667 --> 01:59.625
It's always the same.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.083
We raid, and nobody's there.

02:04.042 --> 02:06.833
Are the Gods angry with us?

02:12.583 --> 02:16.292
Hear the words of the Gods!

02:16.958 --> 02:20.125
"Half a loaf of bread is better than none."

02:21.000 --> 02:24.750
"The early bird gets the worm."

02:25.917 --> 02:28.833
Cryptograf, make yourself useful for once.

02:29.292 --> 02:30.583
Odin says...

02:31.792 --> 02:34.833
How do our enemies vanish without a trace?

02:35.375 --> 02:40.250
Odin says that fear lends them wings.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.542
What did you say?

02:44.792 --> 02:47.958
This thing "fear"
gives them the power to fly?

02:48.250 --> 02:54.000
- No, it was just a figure of speech.
- Imagine if we could fly!

02:58.708 --> 03:02.042
Excuse me, I think
you've misinterpreted what...

03:02.250 --> 03:07.125
We need to find a champion of fear,
who will teach us this magic art.

03:07.375 --> 03:11.792
With fear giving us wings,
nothing will stand in our way.

03:11.958 --> 03:16.250
Soon we can boast to the world,
Vikings know all about fear!

03:16.417 --> 03:21.500
We are the most chicken-hearted,
jelly-bellied, weak-kneed cowards of all!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.875
Cowards! Cowards! Cowards!

03:26.500 --> 03:31.917
I would give anything
to whoever brings me that champion.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.667
Anything?!

03:39.583 --> 03:41.458
Cryptograf!
Can you do it?

03:44.625 --> 03:48.792
Odin says that the champion of fear is...

03:50.542 --> 03:52.667
located right...

03:52.958 --> 03:54.292
right...

03:55.250 --> 03:56.542
right there.

04:07.083 --> 04:10.125
And where has the finger of fate pointed?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.792
A village of steadfast Gauls.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.917
The last hold-out against the Roman Empire.

04:16.083 --> 04:20.250
Sharing mutual respect,
harmony and understanding.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.375
- Hi Obelix.
- So, Asterix...

04:29.583 --> 04:31.750
Anything exciting happening today?

04:31.917 --> 04:33.083
No, not really.

04:33.542 --> 04:37.875
- Hey, any trouble from the Romans?
- Nah, afraid not.

04:39.125 --> 04:42.667
- My fish is rotten?
- It's more than rotten, Unhygienix...

04:43.000 --> 04:49.042
I feel like something's missing around here.
I don't know what, maybe a good fish fight.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.042
Actually, there's
a fish fight right now.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.542
There is?

04:56.167 --> 04:57.417
Want to join in?

04:58.542 --> 05:02.125
- I suppose so.
- But Obelix, no stones, okay?

05:02.292 --> 05:05.375
- Well, at least they're fresh.
- Stop the fight!

05:06.208 --> 05:07.375
Stop, I say!

05:08.500 --> 05:09.917
Stop it!

05:10.625 --> 05:16.417
I hold in my hand a letter
from my brother Doublehelix,

05:16.667 --> 05:22.208
the renowned warrior.
The famous hero of the Battle of Gergovia,

05:22.375 --> 05:27.000
who fought side by side
with the great Vercingetorix.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.208
But what's the news?

05:30.292 --> 05:32.000
Oh, yes.

05:32.167 --> 05:36.625
He's sending his
son Justforkix here from Parisium.

05:36.792 --> 05:40.083
Now, you're my two finest warriors.

05:40.250 --> 05:45.208
I'm giving you the job
of training Justforkix to be a man.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.958
We'll make him
the greatest warrior Gaul's ever seen!

05:49.542 --> 05:53.667
We must prepare a grand feast in his honor.

05:53.917 --> 05:56.875
All right, people, you know what to do.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.333
Hey, dudes.

06:23.542 --> 06:24.792
So...

06:25.125 --> 06:27.583
Are you...
of course you are...

06:28.000 --> 06:29.833
Justforkix!

06:30.167 --> 06:36.500
This is Justforkix, son of my brother
Doublehelix, the renowned warrior.

06:36.750 --> 06:40.875
- The famous hero of the battle of...
- Yeah, yeah. Big deal.

06:44.042 --> 06:48.417
These are my finest warriors,
Asterix and Obelix.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.833
They're in charge of your training.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.542
Hello.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.667
Hey, look at that.
Is that your bird?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.958
Yeah, that's SMS... Shortmessageserviceix.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.625
I send SMS's to all my babes.

07:19.917 --> 07:23.250
Guess you're not into new technology,
in the sticks.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.000
Hey, what's for dinner?

07:25.208 --> 07:30.000
- We've prepared an exquisite hors d'oeuvre...
- This fish isn't very fresh.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.917
- I told you so!
- Not fresh?! Why you!

07:40.417 --> 07:44.083
It's great about Parisium
that it's a 24-hour town.

07:44.417 --> 07:50.750
Yeah, well, you know. Open all night.
Trance, dance, the works. It's pretty cool.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.042
You want some wild boar?

07:58.458 --> 08:02.167
Oh, yeah! No.
I don't eat meat, just vegetables.

08:02.667 --> 08:07.583
Vegetables? But, you don't understand.
I bagged the boar myself!

08:07.750 --> 08:13.083
Come on, try a teeny-weenie bite.
When I was your age I ate nothing but boar.

08:13.667 --> 08:18.125
Boar pudding. Boar pot pie.
Boar cake with marmalade...

08:20.125 --> 08:25.333
- Don't force him, you'll turn him off.
- Look at him. See how skinny he is?

08:25.500 --> 08:30.292
If we want to make a warrior out of him,
we've got to get him to eat.

08:38.417 --> 08:42.042
Man! This really is the sticks!

08:50.667 --> 08:55.542
Cacofonix, warble one tune,
and you'll be singing in a boys choir.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.042
Barbarian!

08:59.875 --> 09:02.375
- You want to dance?
- To this?!

09:02.792 --> 09:06.958
No way!
Celtic music is, like, so ancient history!

09:07.708 --> 09:11.250
So, uh... what's, like, groovy right now?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.917
Let me show you how we get down'n dirty

09:18.083 --> 09:20.625
back in the catacombs of Parisium

10:21.333 --> 10:24.375
Hey, are you in the flow, bro?

10:24.917 --> 10:28.792
Oh, yeah. I'm down and dirty, bro.

10:45.208 --> 10:49.500
Sure you packed everything, Olaf?
Your mace? A change of under-armor?

10:49.667 --> 10:51.708
Dad, please!

10:52.083 --> 10:57.125
This is my 34th or 35th raid.

11:30.292 --> 11:33.625
- Oh, honey, come here a sec.
- Yes, dear.

11:34.458 --> 11:40.250
While you pillage the barbarians, drop by
their temple and pick up some chandeliers.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.958
- Yes, dear.
- And here's a list of furniture I want.

11:44.125 --> 11:50.125
I want a selection of economical
but stylish tables, bookcases and cabinets,

11:50.292 --> 11:54.125
in oak and teak, that are easily assembled.
You got that?

11:54.292 --> 11:55.583
Yes, Vikea.

11:55.958 --> 12:01.333
- We could use a new pair of matching skulls.
- I'll look out for twins.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.125
Okay, is it time to go?
I'm all ready.

12:07.292 --> 12:13.375
Abba, I've told you a hundred times. This is
not a pleasure cruise, it's a business trip.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.458
Oh, Daddy, please?
Pretty please?

12:16.625 --> 12:22.250
Let me come, just this once, and then
I'll never bother you again, I promise.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.500
Well...

12:25.292 --> 12:28.292
Absolutely not!
No women or children on board!

12:28.458 --> 12:29.792
- Why?
- Don't argue.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.458
I have spoken, by Thor
and Odin put together!

12:33.625 --> 12:36.542
Don't you go berserk on me, young lady!

12:43.250 --> 12:44.833
I'll make another list.

12:45.542 --> 12:49.333
No women?! No children on board?!

12:50.708 --> 12:52.875
Being a girl sucks!

13:01.875 --> 13:03.083
Heave!

13:03.917 --> 13:06.917
Heave away, lads.

13:35.250 --> 13:39.542
Justforkix?
Time to start training to become a warrior.

13:40.625 --> 13:44.417
It's not even noon, yet.
Wake me up at 3.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.500
Obelix?
May I?

14:14.875 --> 14:16.083
Pirates!

14:19.833 --> 14:20.875
Gauls!

14:42.833 --> 14:44.625
Being a man sucks.

15:51.875 --> 15:52.917
No, no, no...

16:16.083 --> 16:19.000
Gentleman, how is my nephew doing?

16:19.167 --> 16:23.917
- Fantastic, he's doing great.
- Great might not be the word, exactly.

16:24.083 --> 16:28.333
- Oh, yeah. He's doing really great.
- Let's say we're doing our best.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.667
Impedimenta!
Bring him in!

16:32.917 --> 16:34.333
Go on.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.625
No! No, not them!

16:38.292 --> 16:41.667
Please! Please!
Don't leave me alone with them!

16:42.625 --> 16:48.417
Is that what you call fantastic?!
Great progress?!

16:48.625 --> 16:52.333
I gave you a mission to make a man of him.

16:53.042 --> 16:56.708
- Nobody asked me if I wanted to be a man.
- That's enough.

16:56.875 --> 17:03.667
You'll carry on. And you two
better find something he likes to do!

17:08.167 --> 17:10.083
It's ready!

17:13.083 --> 17:15.792
- We getting ready for a party?
- Sort of.

17:17.125 --> 17:21.000
But first you need a little pick-me-up.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.167
Whoa, thanks sonny.

17:37.500 --> 17:41.083
Yeah, I'm not drinking that.
It's not organic.

17:43.708 --> 17:44.750
Wait!

17:45.000 --> 17:48.042
- Wait, it's good for you.
- Look at him go!

17:48.458 --> 17:52.125
It'll make you manly!
It'll put hair on your chest!

17:52.583 --> 17:56.917
You don't have any.
Come to think of it, neither do I.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.625
Obelix!

18:07.167 --> 18:08.208
Thank you.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.625
- Salmon or salmon.
- Salmon.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.042
- Salmon or...
- Salmon.

18:15.250 --> 18:21.000
- Salmon or salmon.
- Salmon... salmon.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.583
You new?
I don't know you.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.208
Yeah...

18:52.208 --> 18:54.208
Abba!
What are you doing here?!

18:54.375 --> 18:58.667
- I said you can't come!
- I've had it up to here with can't!

19:00.083 --> 19:03.708
I'm not staying at home anymore!

19:04.250 --> 19:08.208
- Is it right to treat women like slaves?
- YEAH!

19:08.583 --> 19:11.542
Well, one day we're going to be equal to men!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.417
Yeah!

19:14.333 --> 19:17.542
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm not!

19:17.750 --> 19:20.750
Women want to fly, too.
We want to learn fear!

19:21.000 --> 19:25.625
- We can be just as scared as men.
- Yeah!

19:28.083 --> 19:33.333
- Who is this new guy?
- That's my daughter, cod brain!

19:34.375 --> 19:36.708
Your daughter's a man?

19:37.417 --> 19:39.708
Land ahead!

19:40.625 --> 19:44.250
Okay, men!
Back in your seats and fasten your seatbelts!

19:44.458 --> 19:46.625
We're getting ready for landing.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.583
Um, guys?

20:06.583 --> 20:08.667
I'm really not sure about this.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.083
Just relax, It'll be fun!
Everybody's going.

20:19.208 --> 20:22.583
- Is this where the party is?
- You could say that.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.917
Long live Pax Romana!

20:36.083 --> 20:38.042
- What is that?!
- Whoa!

20:38.292 --> 20:40.333
Cesar forever!

20:41.833 --> 20:44.208
That's Oleaginous.
He's new round here.

20:44.792 --> 20:47.583
- Can I take this one?
- Leave him to the kid.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.542
Right, Asterix.
Leave him to it. Come on.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.792
All right, all right. Take it easy.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.625
- Would your Highness care to do the honors?
- What?!

21:00.792 --> 21:01.833
On 3.

21:02.042 --> 21:03.292
- Are you crazy?
- 1.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.083
- I'm a pacifist!
- 2.

21:05.250 --> 21:08.042
- I'm not going to fight anyone!
- 3!

21:08.583 --> 21:11.042
- Hey, you did it!
- First one down!

21:11.292 --> 21:13.083
Yeah! Well done!

21:25.375 --> 21:27.542
They're animals!

21:43.417 --> 21:48.250
- Let me out of here!
- Second door on the right, past the tent.

21:48.667 --> 21:49.750
Thank you.

21:52.917 --> 21:56.542
- Hey, the kid's getting into it.
- I knew he'd like it.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.958
Crazy!

22:10.542 --> 22:12.333
They're all crazy!

22:23.375 --> 22:24.667
Vikings!

22:31.250 --> 22:34.958
At last, my fist raid. I can't wait!

22:35.167 --> 22:40.292
Nah... don't even think about it.
You stay on board till we're back home.

22:40.583 --> 22:44.167
- What? You can't do that!
- Yes I can.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.917
- I won't stay, you can't make me.
- Yes I can.

22:48.292 --> 22:49.583
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.625
Oh, yeah?

22:52.083 --> 22:53.542
Yeah!

22:59.000 --> 23:02.042
All right, men, you know why we're here.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.625
But they'll be no
killing and plundering this time.

23:05.792 --> 23:07.708
Always nitpicking.

23:08.083 --> 23:13.292
Rather than slaughter them, we must
observe them, and get what we came for.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.583
Find the champion!
Then we'll slaughter them.

23:24.833 --> 23:27.958
Olaf, over here.

23:28.917 --> 23:31.458
- You sure you got the plan?
- Yeah.

23:32.083 --> 23:36.458
No. I'm sorry, Dad,
but it's a really complicated plan!

23:38.625 --> 23:40.500
Sit down and I'll try again.

23:42.125 --> 23:44.125
Here, this is you.

23:44.708 --> 23:47.000
- I'm a rock?
- Just pretend it's you.

23:47.167 --> 23:49.667
- Okay.
- Here's the champion of fear.

23:49.833 --> 23:54.667
See how he's trembling. If you capture the
champion of fear, like this...

23:54.875 --> 23:59.042
Then you can ask
Chief Timeandahaf for anything you want.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.625
Oh.

24:01.083 --> 24:04.792
- What do I want?
- Her, the chief's daughter.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.167
- Abba?!
- Looks like a rock.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.750
There. It's a girl.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.250
- What am I supposed to do with her?
- Marry her.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.875
Why? She took my hair!

24:18.375 --> 24:23.583
The chief doesn't have a son, so his
son-in-law is next in line to be chief.

24:23.958 --> 24:26.125
Do you understand the plan, now?

24:28.792 --> 24:30.083
Yeah!

24:31.708 --> 24:33.792
I'm a rock.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.958
Well, that went rather well.

24:47.750 --> 24:52.083
Yeah. Good enough for the kid, anyway.
He enjoyed himself, I think.

24:52.625 --> 24:57.208
- Obelix, Asterix, help! They're coming!
- Ah, there's our boy.

24:57.458 --> 24:58.875
Yeah, look at him run!

24:59.583 --> 25:03.667
They're landing!
The Vikings are landing on the beach!

25:03.833 --> 25:06.375
We have to tell the others!

25:06.625 --> 25:11.625
- Take it easy. One invader at a time.
- That's right. They take their time.

25:11.917 --> 25:12.958
We were...

25:14.583 --> 25:19.250
- We have to go. What are you waiting for?!
- What? You want to go now?

25:19.542 --> 25:24.083
Aren't you listening to me?
Don't you know who the Vikings are?

25:24.375 --> 25:28.708
Sure, they're ruthless warriors
who destroy everything in their path.

25:29.333 --> 25:33.333
Just because we're provincial
doesn't mean we're not with it.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.292
I don't under...

25:56.250 --> 26:00.083
- Maybe we should talk to him.
- I think he's hungry.

26:00.333 --> 26:05.250
- I'll go get a boar.
- No! It's better if you talked to him.

26:15.708 --> 26:20.375
All right, listen. You mustn't get scared.
We're here for you.

26:20.708 --> 26:24.542
Remember, we're Gauls.
We don't know the meaning of fear.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.292
Well I do. I'm an expert.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.375
I'm afraid of everything.

26:31.875 --> 26:35.000
I'm, like, the champion of fear.

26:36.708 --> 26:40.583
There, there.
Look at you, a big tough warrior.

26:41.125 --> 26:44.000
You're not frightened now, are you?

26:44.333 --> 26:48.833
I guess not. It's not so bad, now.
As long as you're here.

26:49.458 --> 26:52.042
- Spoil sports.
- We'd better get going.

26:52.458 --> 26:56.125
- Or we'll miss lunch.
- We'll continue training tomorrow.

26:56.583 --> 27:00.000
You can easily become a warrior. No problem.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.375
No, it's hopeless.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.792
What?!

27:08.000 --> 27:11.833
You saw the champion?!
And he knows the meaning of fear?!

27:12.708 --> 27:14.625
Yeah, yeah he does.

27:14.792 --> 27:18.292
I observed him.
But when he's with those stupid Gauls,

27:18.542 --> 27:21.125
he forgets it. He's not so bright.

27:21.292 --> 27:22.625
You idiot!

27:23.167 --> 27:27.792
You saw him and didn't grab him?
You think we're here to take notes?

27:28.125 --> 27:33.583
Rescue the champion before these
barbarians train all the fear out of him.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.000
Hey!

27:44.458 --> 27:45.625
Justforkix, I...

27:45.958 --> 27:50.542
I've been trying out some of
the dance steps you showed me, and...

27:50.708 --> 27:53.583
I'm just not sure I got it right.

27:57.417 --> 28:03.458
Well, you're right, you don't got it right.
Your left foot goes behind, like this.

28:03.792 --> 28:07.458
- Oh, yeah, It's better.
- Yeah, much better.

28:07.792 --> 28:11.875
Practice when I'm gone,
and you'll rule the dance floor in no time.

28:12.042 --> 28:13.083
Gone?!

28:14.167 --> 28:16.292
Justforkix, are you leaving us?

28:17.917 --> 28:19.333
Yeah.

28:21.083 --> 28:25.167
Hey, Justforkix. Hold on a sec.

28:28.792 --> 28:33.792
Here, kid, I got something for you.
This is my finest stone.

28:34.042 --> 28:37.083
I wanted to give it to you
when you graduated.

28:37.250 --> 28:40.625
When you became a warrior.
But you can have it, now.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.417
You can keep training with it back home.

28:43.583 --> 28:47.125
If you try to lift it everyday,
I'm sure you'll make it.

28:47.333 --> 28:50.917
Yeah... I don't think so.
It's impossible.

28:51.625 --> 28:54.625
How can you know if you don't try?

29:01.917 --> 29:05.042
What are you doing?
You're encouraging him to go.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.875
- It's his decision to make.
- No, it isn't! No, it isn't!

29:09.083 --> 29:12.708
What about our promise,
and the honor of the village?

29:12.875 --> 29:17.625
- We can't force him, it isn't right!
- Well, it's not right to...

29:22.958 --> 29:25.667
Faster, yeah!
Faster!

29:42.167 --> 29:45.667
Oh, will you look at that.
The axel is shot!

29:46.583 --> 29:48.042
Stupid stone!

29:48.375 --> 29:51.917
This is great!
Just keeps getting better and better!

29:56.875 --> 29:58.708
Who's there?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.750
Hello?

30:03.042 --> 30:04.958
Obelix? Asterix?

30:05.750 --> 30:07.167
Is that you?

30:08.417 --> 30:11.250
Hello?
It's just the wind.

30:12.542 --> 30:15.542
The wind... and some squirrels.

30:16.292 --> 30:19.292
Teeny-weenie harmless little squirrels.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.292
And a Viking!

30:28.708 --> 30:32.292
He doesn't want to be here,
and we don't want him here.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.375
I guess it's better this way.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.792
I feel pretty good about it.
Don't you feel pretty good about it?

30:40.542 --> 30:42.083
I guess so.

30:42.542 --> 30:45.083
Oh boy, I'm getting hungry.

30:45.625 --> 30:49.250
I sure could use a couple of boars.
What do you say?

30:49.458 --> 30:52.042
- I'm not hungry.
- You're not? Come on.

30:52.208 --> 30:55.292
Couple of nice, juicy, boars!

30:56.875 --> 31:02.375
You know?
He never even got to taste that wild boar.

31:05.333 --> 31:10.792
We didn't make him feel that welcome,
if you think about it. He was improving, too.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.458
With just a little bit more training, we
could have made a real warrior out of him.

31:18.708 --> 31:22.125
Well, It's gonna
be real quiet around here, now.

31:23.625 --> 31:25.208
SMS?!

31:25.708 --> 31:29.417
Wait! What?
What's happening?

31:41.125 --> 31:43.250
Justforkix had an accident!

31:45.250 --> 31:48.167
Ah, these foreign chariots are junk.

31:48.375 --> 31:51.792
You put in a teeny little stone,
and they bust.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.167
Strange that he went off
into the forest, alone.

31:55.875 --> 31:59.292
Even stranger, he left my present behind.

32:02.417 --> 32:03.542
Obelix, look!

32:15.167 --> 32:16.417
Justforkix's sword!

32:17.500 --> 32:20.458
He's been kidnapped by the Vikings!

32:21.417 --> 32:22.500
Oh, no.

32:24.083 --> 32:26.917
We have to tell the chief.

32:30.875 --> 32:32.667
Asterix. Obelix.

32:33.917 --> 32:37.958
Guess who's dropped by.
My brother Doublehelix,

32:38.125 --> 32:41.292
the renowned warrior, the famous hero of...

32:41.458 --> 32:45.583
Please no flattery.
Don't forget the battle of Parisium!

32:50.542 --> 32:55.000
Well, I only have a few minutes
before I have to go off to Parisium.

32:55.292 --> 32:58.958
- I'll just go say hello to Justforkix.
- No!

32:59.667 --> 33:02.167
- You can't see him.
- It's impossible.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.375
He's far, far away.

33:05.708 --> 33:08.875
- On a... field trip.
- It's a... training program.

33:09.292 --> 33:11.667
Lot of training, in the program.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.542
Are we talking about the same kid?

33:17.917 --> 33:19.500
Oh, that's a good one.

33:19.917 --> 33:22.292
I'll return at the next full moon.

33:22.625 --> 33:28.792
He'll be back from his field trip by then,
I suppose. See you later.

33:35.125 --> 33:38.708
The Vikings?!

33:42.958 --> 33:44.958
I make a solemn vow.

33:45.333 --> 33:47.708
I shall go to the land of the Vikings,

33:47.875 --> 33:51.375
and bring back Justforkix,
before the next full moon.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.792
- Me too!
- That's good.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.917
My nephew's life, and the
honor of the village, are in your hands.

33:59.167 --> 34:02.875
- Don't worry, we'll get him back in time.
- Asterix.

34:03.042 --> 34:06.417
Take this potion with you,
for the dangers ahead.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.667
Go north till you hit
the first intersection of land.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.125
- Turn left...
- Left.

34:12.333 --> 34:16.000
- Veer right... Go straight...
- Right... Straight...

34:16.167 --> 34:19.958
- Right again, then jig and veer off...
- Jig?!

34:20.417 --> 34:25.042
- What was that? Jig?
- Just follow the North Star.

34:25.458 --> 34:29.083
- Right, got you, North Star.
- Wait! Wait!

34:29.542 --> 34:35.750
Before going off on your epic journey,
you cannot leave without a farewell ballad.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.750
- No, no... you shouldn't...
- But I insist.

34:41.958 --> 34:43.000
Oops.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.792
Farewell. Luck be with you!

34:48.625 --> 34:49.750
What's all that?

34:51.083 --> 34:52.292
Survival rations.

35:07.833 --> 35:11.083
He doesn't look too smashed up.

35:14.042 --> 35:15.083
Mercy!

35:15.333 --> 35:17.500
Mercy?
What's that?

35:20.958 --> 35:24.708
Must be another one
of their strange inventions.

35:32.458 --> 35:33.500
He's good.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.167
Tie him up.
I don't want him flying away.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.292
No!

35:59.542 --> 36:02.500
I'm hungry!

36:03.042 --> 36:07.667
Maybe you shouldn't have eaten
all the survival rations on the first day!

36:08.042 --> 36:11.625
I can't help it, when I'm worried, I eat.

36:12.458 --> 36:15.292
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

36:15.667 --> 36:19.208
A fog is hiding the sky.
I can't see the North Star.

36:20.250 --> 36:23.083
Or anything else, for that matter.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.292
SMS! I thought I'd lost you.

36:40.750 --> 36:43.667
We'll get out of this, right?

36:44.625 --> 36:47.125
Hey! Cool bird. It's yours, right?

36:47.708 --> 36:51.917
- Yeah, sure. It's mine all right.
- Are you the champion?

36:52.250 --> 36:54.625
My name is Justforkix.
Who are you?

36:55.042 --> 36:57.958
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I'm Abba.

36:58.958 --> 37:01.292
Would you help me?

37:02.250 --> 37:04.875
- Yeah, if I can.
- Okay.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.042
Oh, wow!

37:12.917 --> 37:16.667
Yeah... thanks, that's nice.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.667
You're cold?

37:21.042 --> 37:24.125
No, I'm not cold... I'm...

37:24.833 --> 37:28.583
- Afraid.
- You are so lucky!

37:28.958 --> 37:30.917
- Lucky?
- To be able to fly!

37:31.625 --> 37:34.750
- Fly?
- I'd love to fly over the sea like a bird,

37:34.958 --> 37:38.708
and go higher and higher,
right up to the sun!

37:39.500 --> 37:43.583
Will you teach me? Please, teach me.

37:43.958 --> 37:49.792
- Tell me your secret.
- If you help me get back home, I'll try.

37:49.958 --> 37:51.583
What are you doing?!

37:51.750 --> 37:55.000
I've told you 100 times
not to talk to strangers!

37:55.167 --> 37:58.917
- Sorry!
- Not you! Her!

37:59.083 --> 38:04.292
Gee, Dad, thanks for
embarrassing me in front of the hostage!

38:20.583 --> 38:25.125
- I'm still hungry!
- No kidding.

38:25.958 --> 38:30.208
Asterix, do you really think
the North Star is still up there?

38:30.375 --> 38:31.792
Above the fog?

38:32.917 --> 38:34.750
Unless you ate it, yes.

38:35.500 --> 38:39.750
Obelix, you just gave me an idea.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.750
- Did you see it?
- No. Try again.

38:53.292 --> 38:54.625
That way Obelix!

39:30.833 --> 39:35.833
- So, can you talk your dad into letting me go?
- As soon as you teach me to fly.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.583
Oh, yeah... that.

39:39.417 --> 39:41.625
I was just wondering...

39:42.250 --> 39:44.958
What's your attitude about people who...

39:45.125 --> 39:50.625
promise something and then can't deliver it?

39:50.792 --> 39:53.125
Oh, you mean a liar?
Look up there.

39:56.875 --> 39:57.917
What's that?!

39:58.083 --> 40:03.083
The last guy who lied to me.
Daddy took care of him.

40:03.250 --> 40:06.625
How's 3 o'clock Tuesday,
for the first flying lesson?

40:15.958 --> 40:19.542
Let's raise our skulls
to the champion of fear!

40:19.708 --> 40:21.083
Long live the champ!

40:21.583 --> 40:25.125
Long live the champ!
Long live the champ!

40:25.500 --> 40:31.208
- Will they be drinking out of my head, soon?
- No, silly! This is how we welcome guests.

40:33.083 --> 40:35.958
- ... For he's a jolly good Viking
- Skol! Skol!

40:36.833 --> 40:42.250
So, I assume this is organic vegetable juice?
It's vegetable juice, right?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.750
That's organic, all right.

40:48.542 --> 40:51.292
...For he's a jolly good Viking

40:51.458 --> 40:53.417
And so say all of us

40:53.583 --> 40:55.250
And so say all of us...

41:11.542 --> 41:12.583
Look!

41:26.083 --> 41:29.083
- That way.
- Yeah, that way.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.375
Wait!

41:31.500 --> 41:33.750
I have an idea.

41:36.042 --> 41:37.250
Telegraph.

41:38.375 --> 41:39.542
Stenograph.

41:40.583 --> 41:42.083
Horriblegraf.

41:42.708 --> 41:43.917
Nescaf.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.625
Riffraff.

41:47.917 --> 41:50.042
- About time.
- Hafandhaf.

41:51.958 --> 41:53.042
What's so funny?

41:53.833 --> 41:57.292
You hear that, Asterix?
All their names end in "af".

41:57.458 --> 42:02.167
Asteraf! Actually, my name is Asteraf...
Obelaf.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.042
Obelaf!

42:04.250 --> 42:06.958
I don't have you on the invitation list.

42:09.708 --> 42:12.583
We're right here!

42:13.083 --> 42:16.417
Okay. We're officially sneaked in.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.500
Not now.
We have to find Justforkix.

42:29.292 --> 42:32.583
- Hey you, come here!
- Wow! He's back up already!

42:32.750 --> 42:37.208
They're tougher than the Romans,
don't you think? I'll handle him.

42:37.417 --> 42:41.125
Okay, but what ever you do,
don't get yourself...

42:42.792 --> 42:45.167
- Noticed.
- What's going on, here?!

42:45.375 --> 42:50.250
Can't I have a moment of peace and quiet
to eat my walrus à la crème.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.833
How do you make walrus a la crème?
It sounds divine.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.333
Oh, it is.

42:56.083 --> 43:01.250
It's just like making strawberries a la
crème, only instead of strawberries...

43:01.417 --> 43:04.833
Wait a minute!
Who are you and what are you doing here?

43:05.167 --> 43:09.000
I'm Asteraf, and this is Obelaf. Shut up.

43:09.417 --> 43:12.958
- We're looking for Justforkix.
- Ah, the champion.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.417
The champion of what?

43:15.625 --> 43:18.500
Well, fear, of course. Take a look.

43:36.333 --> 43:41.083
- Why aren't you dancing with your fiancée?
- I'm busy.

43:49.083 --> 43:50.417
He's in trouble!

43:55.458 --> 43:57.750
Leave me alone!
They're my friends.

43:58.125 --> 44:00.875
- Friends?
- Long live the champ...

44:04.250 --> 44:07.542
That's great, "champ",
but it's time to say goodbye.

44:07.708 --> 44:10.792
We're going home.
Say bye. Bye, everyone.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.625
- Hey, I just got here.
- Your dad expects you back by the full moon.

44:17.792 --> 44:19.917
Oh, no. Not Dad.

44:20.333 --> 44:22.125
Oh, no! Not Dad!

44:22.458 --> 44:24.000
I'm staying here!

44:24.125 --> 44:25.417
He's staying here!

44:26.958 --> 44:29.250
Enough, already. You're coming with us!

44:29.417 --> 44:32.958
- Careful, you'll get him mad.
- You're just like Dad.

44:33.125 --> 44:38.250
- Don't do this, don't do that...
- If he says that it's for your own good.

44:38.417 --> 44:39.792
He cares about you.

44:40.125 --> 44:44.042
He doesn't care about me.
He only wants to get rid of me.

44:44.208 --> 44:50.125
If he cared about me, he wouldn't have sent
me to stay with a bunch of country bumpkins.

44:50.417 --> 44:53.375
- Bumpkins?!
- Bumpkins?

44:54.583 --> 45:01.583
You put me through a nightmare. They treat me
like I deserve. Just go away, all right?!

45:01.833 --> 45:06.000
I never want to see you again!

45:07.042 --> 45:08.375
Obelix, wait.

45:16.083 --> 45:18.292
Don't forget the tip.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.542
Obelix! Wait for me!

45:31.917 --> 45:34.625
Hey! Obelix!

45:41.208 --> 45:43.333
Justforkix, wait!

45:43.625 --> 45:45.417
Who were those 2 strangers?

45:46.708 --> 45:50.375
- Nobody.
- What's wrong? You were having fun, before.

45:51.792 --> 45:54.375
It was just a message from my father.

45:54.667 --> 45:58.875
I've got problems.
You wouldn't understand.

45:59.208 --> 46:02.208
Maybe I understand better than you think.

46:02.417 --> 46:06.417
Don't worry about it. Come on, lighten up.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.625
Yes!

46:24.667 --> 46:28.583
It's past your bedtime.
Go home, now! Beat it!

46:29.458 --> 46:31.542
- Sorry!
- Let's get out of here.

46:34.625 --> 46:39.833
- We should get back to the party.
- Yeah. Let's go back in.

46:41.958 --> 46:43.667
Friends!

46:43.917 --> 46:49.125
I propose a toast to the man who
brilliantly accomplished his mission...

46:49.417 --> 46:53.000
by capturing the champion of fear!

46:53.208 --> 46:55.917
None other than my son, Olaf.

46:56.083 --> 46:58.625
Yeah!
Long live Olaf!

46:58.792 --> 47:01.750
- Long live Olaf!
- So...

47:02.125 --> 47:04.542
What does that big lad of yours want?

47:05.500 --> 47:08.250
- What?
- My son, Olaf,

47:08.625 --> 47:13.292
has the honor to request
the hand of your daughter, Abba.

47:15.250 --> 47:17.708
- My daughter's hand!
- My daughter's hand?

47:17.875 --> 47:20.583
I could use her skull, but a hand?

47:21.042 --> 47:22.667
What's this all about?

47:23.208 --> 47:27.333
- You promised me to this fish face?!
- It's none of your business.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.625
Choosing a husband
is none of a woman's business?!

47:31.792 --> 47:37.125
That's the Viking way. You pick out a girl
and drag her back to your house.

47:37.375 --> 47:42.083
That's how I met your mom. Nothing wrong
with the good old ways, right, Vikea?

47:42.292 --> 47:46.792
Besides the near scalping,
and the road rash from the dragging...

47:47.125 --> 47:49.583
it was the happiest day of my life.

47:49.833 --> 47:54.208
- Could I jump in here, for a sec.
- I'm not marrying that haddock brain!

47:54.375 --> 47:58.750
- You're marrying the haddock brain!
- There's not going to be a wedding!

47:59.000 --> 48:00.333
Yes, there is!

48:03.500 --> 48:04.917
Stop her!

48:09.250 --> 48:10.833
- Justforkix!
- Abba!

48:11.125 --> 48:13.792
- No!
- Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

48:13.958 --> 48:16.875
As the champion, I am warning you that...

48:19.042 --> 48:22.042
Tomorrow would be a good day for the wedding.

48:22.250 --> 48:25.000
All right. But first...

48:25.417 --> 48:31.125
The champion
is going to show us how he flies.

48:31.667 --> 48:32.917
Obelix.

48:33.708 --> 48:37.125
Obelix. Were are you going?
Planning to walk home?

48:37.333 --> 48:38.500
Yes.

48:38.792 --> 48:41.375
I know how you feel, but Justforkix...

48:41.542 --> 48:44.833
Don't mention that name!
I've already forgotten it!

48:46.375 --> 48:48.292
That's my doggie.

48:48.458 --> 48:53.375
That's a good doggie who loves his daddy.
Unlike some others I won't name.

48:53.583 --> 48:55.250
You can't just walk off.

48:55.458 --> 48:58.333
- Why not?
- Justforkix needs us.

48:58.583 --> 49:01.375
He just doesn't know it.
Come and help me.

49:01.708 --> 49:05.083
I can't after what he said. It's impossible.

49:05.667 --> 49:09.417
That's what Justforkix said
about lifting the stone.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.875
All right, go ahead and frighten us.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.875
- Why?
- So we can fly, of course.

49:27.083 --> 49:29.000
Is he stupid, or what?

49:29.250 --> 49:30.708
They're crazy!

49:31.125 --> 49:33.542
- I said, scare us!
- Yeah.

49:33.917 --> 49:36.417
Sure, here we go.

49:41.875 --> 49:43.875
- What's that?
- It's a scary growl.

49:44.208 --> 49:47.833
No, this is a scary growl.

49:51.708 --> 49:53.917
I'm confused.
Now you're scaring me.

49:54.208 --> 49:58.958
Enough! It's time for the champion to
demonstrate his flying skills.

49:59.750 --> 50:02.292
- Take him to the cliff.
- No!

50:03.417 --> 50:05.292
Justforkix!

50:05.667 --> 50:07.208
Justforkix.

50:07.625 --> 50:10.042
Where is everybody?

50:11.083 --> 50:12.917
There's a body.

50:13.250 --> 50:15.583
Where did they take Justforkix?

50:16.042 --> 50:20.125
- I don't know.
- Tell me... where he is...

50:20.542 --> 50:23.542
or I'll really... lose my temper!

50:25.000 --> 50:26.542
Good work. Subtle.

50:26.792 --> 50:31.083
Way to interrogate the enemy
into telling us absolutely nothing!

50:37.542 --> 50:40.208
- Are you ready for takeoff.
- Roger.

50:43.125 --> 50:45.708
We've got a chemical problem.
I'll fix it.

50:46.208 --> 50:49.708
It's my teeth, they're chattering.

50:49.917 --> 50:53.875
He's in perfect flying condition.
Request permission for takeoff.

50:54.125 --> 50:56.083
Roger. Launch the champion.

50:58.250 --> 50:59.667
Stop!

50:59.917 --> 51:01.458
Wait one moment!

51:02.125 --> 51:03.417
What now?!

51:04.208 --> 51:07.208
Look, Thor has given us a sign!

51:09.500 --> 51:10.750
Yes.

51:13.042 --> 51:16.000
- Too late, it's gone.
- Enough stalling.

51:16.458 --> 51:18.875
I'm beginning to think he can't fly.

51:19.500 --> 51:23.292
And if he can't fly, there'll be no wedding!

51:24.667 --> 51:25.708
He can fly.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.125
- No, I can't.
- He's ready now.

51:30.083 --> 51:33.083
No, please don't drop me!
I'm begging you!

51:33.250 --> 51:34.792
Drop him.

51:44.333 --> 51:46.000
Amazing! He's flying!

51:47.333 --> 51:50.875
Alright, you weak-kneed lily-livered cowards!

51:51.042 --> 51:52.917
Let's fly off the cliff!

51:53.208 --> 51:56.125
Off the cliff!
Off the cliff!

51:56.458 --> 51:58.292
Stop!

51:58.542 --> 52:03.042
First of all, you're not scared enough.
And even more important...

52:03.250 --> 52:07.625
- We have a wedding to attend.
- Oh, right.

52:09.250 --> 52:11.250
Wait! What about me?

52:15.583 --> 52:18.125
Olaf?
O-laf!

52:18.708 --> 52:20.417
You have to come too.

52:20.750 --> 52:23.958
This is your We-di-ding!

52:24.125 --> 52:27.375
Okay, if I have to.

52:28.042 --> 52:31.875
What about the champion?
I believe it won't be long, now...

52:32.042 --> 52:34.042
till he's flying back home.

52:37.708 --> 52:40.708
Cryptograph, you coming or what?

52:43.583 --> 52:46.333
Coming, Chief.

52:48.083 --> 52:52.625
Well, this is really strange.
Maybe fear can make you fly.

52:56.667 --> 52:59.042
Help!

53:00.500 --> 53:03.125
Wow, you're pretty strong!

53:04.125 --> 53:06.667
Asterix! Obelix!

53:07.000 --> 53:11.542
I'm so glad to see you! I didn't
think you'd want anything to do with me,

53:11.708 --> 53:14.583
you know, after what I said to you.

53:17.625 --> 53:19.583
Was I really flying?

53:22.542 --> 53:25.292
- Let's get back to the boat.
- We can't go!

53:25.500 --> 53:30.333
The Vikings think that I can fly, so the
chief promised Cryptograph...

53:30.583 --> 53:36.375
that his son will marry Abba, so I can teach
them to fly... We have to stop the wedding.

53:37.208 --> 53:40.458
- These Vikings are crazy!
- No, we're going home.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.625
- Sorry.
- Forget everything I just said!

53:43.833 --> 53:47.333
I hate you! I hate you!

53:58.208 --> 53:59.333
My little girl.

54:05.458 --> 54:07.750
Stop! Turn around!

54:08.000 --> 54:11.208
- We have to take Abba with us!
- We don't have time.

54:11.458 --> 54:16.208
- Anyway, we can't kidnap the chief's daughter.
- She wants to be kidnapped!

54:17.042 --> 54:20.208
Give the kid his Viking.
It would make him happy.

54:20.375 --> 54:23.875
Out of the question!
Don't make any more trouble!

54:24.083 --> 54:30.250
- Don't get mad at me, I didn't do anything.
- No? Not in front of the kid.

54:31.208 --> 54:36.625
If we'd taken him right from the feast,
we wouldn't be in this mess, but no...

54:37.375 --> 54:41.500
Mr. Obelix had to
be a big baby and run off sulking!

54:41.667 --> 54:46.792
And if you had been nicer to him at the
feast, he would have agreed to come along.

54:46.958 --> 54:50.125
I'm tired of all your
"if this-es" and "if thats!"

54:50.375 --> 54:56.417
I get it, only Mr. Asterix has brains, but
Mr. Asterix doesn't know how to talk to kids!

54:56.708 --> 54:59.083
So, I don't know how to talk to kids?!

54:59.292 --> 55:03.750
What do you think, Justforkix?
You think I don't know how to talk to you?

55:04.042 --> 55:06.875
Justforkix?

55:10.458 --> 55:11.500
No!

55:13.000 --> 55:14.833
Can't make me...

55:15.125 --> 55:16.625
get married. No!

55:19.125 --> 55:21.458
It reminds me of my wedding.

55:21.625 --> 55:26.250
You nearly bit my finger off,
before we gagged you.

55:26.667 --> 55:27.958
Good times.

55:28.417 --> 55:31.958
There's going to be trouble
when Justforkix gets back!

55:32.250 --> 55:35.458
But he's not coming back.
He flew away.

55:35.667 --> 55:39.375
And I don't think he's ever coming back.

55:39.542 --> 55:42.125
Nobody move!
Stop the wedding!

55:42.542 --> 55:43.833
Hooray! The champ!

55:44.083 --> 55:45.250
Justforkix!

55:46.625 --> 55:49.583
What are you doing here?
You were falling...

55:50.417 --> 55:53.208
- I mean, flying away.
- Liar!

55:53.417 --> 55:56.625
You know I can't... I can't...

55:58.375 --> 56:01.000
Possibly let this wedding go on.

56:05.417 --> 56:07.542
What happened to you?!

56:08.042 --> 56:10.792
Get him, boys!

56:17.917 --> 56:21.333
- Hey, hands off our kid.
- Right now, buster!

56:38.333 --> 56:40.667
Now's our chance. Let's go!

56:42.500 --> 56:44.458
Follow them!
Kill the champion!

56:44.792 --> 56:49.958
- Do you understand?
- Kill the champion. That I understand.

56:53.083 --> 56:55.625
We have to make it to the harbor!

57:01.625 --> 57:05.917
Why do we need a boat?
You can just fly away and take me with you.

57:06.208 --> 57:07.917
Right, sorry, listen.

57:08.292 --> 57:12.500
I'm just... I'm not scared enough.

57:13.125 --> 57:14.125
look!

57:25.625 --> 57:29.333
If you touch her I will break you in two!
Like this!

57:32.500 --> 57:35.625
Potion wore off.
Just visualize the break.

57:36.250 --> 57:37.333
Like this?

57:41.208 --> 57:43.292
Great, you're afraid!

57:44.667 --> 57:47.917
- Fly away! You can carry me with you!
- I can't!

57:50.667 --> 57:54.500
- You're still not scared enough?
- I'm plenty scared.

57:54.708 --> 57:57.542
But I can't fly!

57:58.000 --> 57:59.458
What?!

58:26.583 --> 58:28.083
Abba!

58:28.333 --> 58:30.292
Are you all right?

58:31.083 --> 58:33.542
You lied to me!

58:33.875 --> 58:37.250
- You're as bad as all the others!
- Abba, wait!

58:37.417 --> 58:40.542
I'm sorry, I never meant to lie to you...

58:41.083 --> 58:42.792
It just sorta happened.

59:06.417 --> 59:08.417
Go find Asterix and Obelix!

59:25.125 --> 59:28.833
That's what I call a fight!
Much more fun than the Romans.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.250
We should invite them
to invade our village some time.

59:35.125 --> 59:37.583
Oh, no! Where's Justforkix?

59:40.250 --> 59:41.292
What's that?

59:44.917 --> 59:48.542
Dogmatix, what's she saying?
What's the message?

59:51.333 --> 59:56.125
It's about Justforkix being in trouble.
She's too tired to say more.

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:09.375
Nice technique!
That bird has talent.

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:14.208
We better follow her.

1:00:23.792 --> 1:00:25.833
Abba!
We have to get away!

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000
This is gonna be fun.

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:46.750
No!
Don't kill him!

1:01:15.792 --> 1:01:19.750
So, who's the champ now?

1:01:29.875 --> 1:01:31.042
Over there!

1:01:46.333 --> 1:01:49.583
Our boy's coming along, isn't he?

1:01:52.958 --> 1:01:58.500
Abba?

1:02:02.417 --> 1:02:04.542
Olaf! Olaf!

1:02:04.708 --> 1:02:07.042
They're coming.
Kill him now!

1:02:08.542 --> 1:02:09.625
Where are you?

1:02:13.792 --> 1:02:16.125
Hi Dad.

1:02:22.083 --> 1:02:23.292
The champion!

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:26.833
He is flying away with your daughter!

1:02:31.125 --> 1:02:32.625
- Hold it!
- Right there!

1:02:34.583 --> 1:02:35.625
You again!

1:02:36.125 --> 1:02:38.417
Stop him before he flies away!

1:02:38.667 --> 1:02:40.500
He's not going to fly away.

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:43.917
He's a liar, and a cheat!
And a phoney!

1:02:44.417 --> 1:02:48.667
- But we saw him fly!
- That's right, we did. We did!

1:02:48.958 --> 1:02:52.667
- It was all a trick.
- See?

1:02:54.292 --> 1:02:58.250
That was me,
holding him up with a rope, right Dad?

1:02:58.542 --> 1:03:01.583
You idiot! That was supposed to be a secret!

1:03:01.958 --> 1:03:04.125
- He can't fly?!
- Oh, boy.

1:03:04.458 --> 1:03:07.792
So, you were trying to trick me!

1:03:08.917 --> 1:03:13.417
- You're shaking. Are you afraid?
- No, no, Chief!

1:03:13.708 --> 1:03:16.833
Well, maybe a smidge.
Tiny morsel of fear.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.917
Perfect!
That's the right condition for flying!

1:03:20.125 --> 1:03:21.958
Odin lied to me!

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:25.875
Fear can't make you fly!

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.042
No!
Abba!

1:03:30.083 --> 1:03:31.125
Justforkix!

1:03:35.458 --> 1:03:36.750
Hold on!

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:55.417
Stay where you are!
We're coming!

1:04:06.333 --> 1:04:10.292
Flying...
flying is the only way out of this, but...

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:13.292
But that's impossible!

1:04:20.458 --> 1:04:22.292
A good friend once told me,

1:04:22.750 --> 1:04:27.000
How can you know something's impossible,
if you don't try?

1:04:31.417 --> 1:04:33.292
- No!
- Justforkix!

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:36.833
No! No.

1:04:42.083 --> 1:04:43.625
Obelix, look!

1:04:48.625 --> 1:04:49.792
He did it!

1:04:52.875 --> 1:04:54.292
He can fly!

1:04:58.625 --> 1:04:59.667
You...

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.833
...saved my life!

1:05:09.833 --> 1:05:14.292
- You see? Do you see what he's doing now?
- Oh, yes.

1:05:15.042 --> 1:05:18.542
He's doing good.
He is doing really good.

1:05:29.583 --> 1:05:32.292
See?
It's not fear that gives you wings...

1:05:32.875 --> 1:05:34.833
It's love.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.333
Hello? Vikings?

1:05:42.750 --> 1:05:45.958
I have congestion, very weak.
Needing help now.

1:05:46.125 --> 1:05:48.250
Please?

1:05:56.375 --> 1:06:02.208
- A little more boar?
- Oh, allow me to pour you another beer.

1:06:09.875 --> 1:06:13.083
Oh, no!
We're not going to make it, in time!

1:06:13.458 --> 1:06:14.667
Faster!

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.500
Where's my son?!

1:06:24.250 --> 1:06:26.417
I told you, he's gone fishing.

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:30.708
No, you said he had gone hunting.

1:06:31.083 --> 1:06:34.042
That's right, hunting for fish!

1:06:34.708 --> 1:06:40.083
Coming from Parisium, I'm sure you'll
appreciate my newest composition.

1:06:58.042 --> 1:07:02.500
I want to see my son now!

1:07:05.125 --> 1:07:08.083
Oh, hi Dad.

1:07:08.500 --> 1:07:13.375
I get it. I know my boy, all right.
Always after the girls.

1:07:29.250 --> 1:07:33.792
And then Justforkix fought Olaf
with just the boom from the sailboat.

1:07:33.958 --> 1:07:37.125
He was like a one-man army.
- Oh, yes.

1:07:37.375 --> 1:07:42.292
Vitalstatistix, I want to thank you
for what you did for my son.

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:47.208
You should thank Asterix and Obelix.
They did it all.

1:07:48.125 --> 1:07:51.542
It wasn't us,
it was all your son.

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:53.958
Justforkix?

1:07:54.792 --> 1:07:55.917
No.

1:07:56.708 --> 1:07:59.125
I'm not going to shake your hand.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:11.542
Son, I'm proud of you.

1:08:23.042 --> 1:08:25.458
A little gift for our hostess.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:32.250
Modern Viking design. Skull wear, lamps,
furniture. We make lovely stuff, you know!

1:08:32.750 --> 1:08:34.375
And this is Fulliautomatix,

1:08:34.625 --> 1:08:38.625
Unhygienix, Geriatrix,
and our resident musician,

1:08:38.792 --> 1:08:40.292
Cacofonix.

1:08:41.375 --> 1:08:44.750
You hear that?
All their names end in "ix"!

1:08:46.542 --> 1:08:53.083
Perhaps you Gentlemen from the North
would like to hear an original Gaul ballad?

1:08:53.583 --> 1:08:57.125
- Sure, sure, I'd love to.
- Okay, this is the moment.

1:09:13.125 --> 1:09:14.833
No more.
No more!

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:18.667
I feel queasy.
My legs are jelly!

1:09:18.833 --> 1:09:20.500
What's wrong with me?

1:09:21.125 --> 1:09:22.583
Now that's fear.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:33.125
If this is fear,
it must mean that we can fly!

1:09:39.625 --> 1:09:43.875
I was wondering, Getafix.
What's the use of fear?

1:09:45.333 --> 1:09:47.875
- Getafix!
- What?

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:50.833
I said, what is the use of fear?

1:09:51.458 --> 1:09:58.250
Fear is what makes us brave.
Real courage is when you overcome fear.

1:10:15.583 --> 1:10:19.875
And so, for the Vikings,
a new adventure begins.

1:10:20.125 --> 1:10:22.292
Because you have to admit...

1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:28.750
Their scientific expedition
succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.542
Oh, here's a fog.

1:10:33.458 --> 1:10:36.042
I hate fog, I get scared!

1:10:36.667 --> 1:10:40.250
I want my mommy, I don't want any fog.

1:10:40.792 --> 1:10:45.417
Mommy!
