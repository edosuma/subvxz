What is that?

00:08.409 --> 00:11.310
What in the hell
is a MySpace page?
It's, like, that friends forum.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.213
These things are pretty awesome.
You create a profile,
put your picture on there--

other people send you pictures
and want to be your friend.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.284
Oh. So that's the saddest

You guys are losers.

Well, maybe it boils
down to this, smart guy.

There's, like, a ton of pictures
of this guy and your mom.

He does kind of look
like you, Dennis.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.484
Don't jump to
any conclusions here.

That's ridiculous.

Is it any more ridiculous
than our dad having brown eyes,

Can we use

Let's get to it.
There's this guy Bruce
who contacted Dee on MySpace,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.871
and he's claiming to be
our biological father.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.874

out of the way.

A long time ago, I met Bruce
and we had this little affair,

Long story short,
he got me pregnant,
and I had to make a decision.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.748
Seeing as he had no money,
I decided that the best thing
for everyone...

04:09.750 --> 04:13.719
was if I didn't tell Bruce
and let your father think
that the twins were his.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.890
- Where's my dad?
- So he's your dad now--

21:32.892 --> 21:35.459
- Get out of the way.
- Daddy.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.363
Don't Daddy me. You blew
your chances with this daddy.
You're dead to me.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.766
No. Just listen for
a second here, okay?
<i>No. No.</i>

21:41.768 --> 21:44.468
We've had a change of heart.
We've decided to forgive you...

21:44.470 --> 21:46.604
and to allow you
to be our father again.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.674
I'm not into
being your dad anymore.
Don't want to be your dad.

21:49.676 --> 21:53.477
Uh, kinda giving you
a second chance here, Dad.
Daddy, yeah.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.680
- No. I'm over it.
- You can't be over it.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.815
No, no, no.
<i>I'm over it.</i>

21:57.817 --> 21:59.984
He can be over it.
Will you shut up?
What is with you two?

21:59.986 --> 22:02.953
- I am over over over it!
- You're not allowed
to be over it!

Charlie?
Hey, Mom.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.064
What-- What are you
doing here?

22:13.066 --> 22:17.468
- I'm confused.
Do you live here?
- Yeah.

22:17.470 --> 22:21.572
- Bonnie?
- Frank!

22:21.574 --> 22:24.809
How do you guys
know each other?
[ Both Giggling ]

22:24.811 --> 22:28.479
This is my date.
<i>[ Mac ] Whoa! Wait a second.</i>
<i>I thought...</i>

22:28.481 --> 22:31.449
you were going on a date
with a woman you had a one-night
stand with 30 years ago.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.684
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:33.686 --> 22:38.055
So if you guys had
a one-night stand 30 years ago,
and I don't--

22:38.057 --> 22:40.858
You know, I don't
know who my... father--

22:40.860 --> 22:43.694
You could be my--

22:48.900 --> 22:51.435
Dad?
