WEBVTT

00:23.824 --> 00:26.594
You all picked the wrong house.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.076
Let's go.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.177
Okay.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.723
We done?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.234
Oh, God.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.069
Guys.
Over here.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.174
I'm a little
beat up, but I'll live.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.442
Thank God you're okay, Director.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.444
The cop outside said
there was a fatality.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.445
We didn't know if...

01:51.545 --> 01:52.646
I'm fine. Fine.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.315
Can't say the same for him.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.616
One of your uninvited guests?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.818
Well, some don't know
when to leave.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.955
Yo, you all right?
Man, don't do that again.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.459
You'll give me a heart attack.
I appreciate your concern,
Agent Torres.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.929
So what happened?
I came for a glass of water,

02:09.029 --> 02:10.798
I walked in on three
guys wearing masks.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.267
Fought 'em off until
one pulled a gun,

02:13.367 --> 02:14.535
and lucky for me, he missed.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.769
This is the shooter here?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.137
Yeah.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.072
I incapacitated him
while the other two ran off.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.610
McGEE: Incapacitated
is an understatement.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.178
Looks like you broke his neck.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.313
Well, he started it.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.014
Well, no ID.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.649
Hopefully prints
are in the system.
How'd they get in?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.818
I don't know.
The alarm didn't go off.

02:30.918 --> 02:31.885
Did they take anything?
No.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.354
Looks like I interrupted them

02:33.454 --> 02:34.655
before they could
steal anything.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.224
Or maybe they weren't
here to steal.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.393
Okay, we don't need
a Bandium alert for this one.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.628
Let's get to it. McGee.

02:40.728 --> 02:41.795
I'll go check
the alarm system.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.231
Knight, talk
to the neighbors.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.799
Torres, a bullet nearly hit
our beloved director

02:45.899 --> 02:47.968
right over there,
so find it for me.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.570
Agent Parker,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.439
I appreciate you
taking this so seriously,

02:51.539 --> 02:52.973
but is this all
really necessary?

02:53.073 --> 02:55.309
I mean, it could just be
a random burglary.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.644
Could be a lot of things.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.646
But I'm not willing
to take that chance.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.553
Anyone else having a hard time
keeping their eyes open?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.321
Kidding?
We've been up since 3:00 a.m.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.324
Oh, man, what I wouldn't give
for a shower and a shave.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.992
I just want out of these pj's.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.228
We're at work,
for crying out loud.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.096
People keep staring at me.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.934
And now you're staring at me.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.004
"Medical Examiners
Convention 2013."

03:24.104 --> 03:25.373
Is it me,

03:25.473 --> 03:28.742
but does Jimmy have
the exact same T-shirt?

03:29.510 --> 03:32.012
Well, Nick, uh,
yeah, I believe he does.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.283
Oh, God.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.617
Hmm.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.852
Okay, what did we get?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.855
Well, unfortunately, our
John Doe is still a John Doe.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.491
Prints aren't in the system.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.060
Jimmy has his body now, though,
so hopefully he can help ID him.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.128
What about the bullet?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.363
I found it lodged
in the cabinet.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.431
Kasie's running
the ballistics now,

03:50.531 --> 03:52.833
but I also talked
to local PD.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.835
Two houses
in Vance's neighborhood

03:54.935 --> 03:56.704
have been robbed
in the last four months.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.105
Could be the same guys.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.574
Except they don't have
Vance's security system.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.477
Thing is state of the art--
AI, biometrics.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.413
Whoever broke in
knew how to bypass it.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.681
So we're looking at pros.
Neighbors see anything?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.783
No, but their
video doorbell did.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.353
The same van drove past
Vance's house repeatedly

04:12.453 --> 04:13.387
the day of the break-in.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.422
Did you get a license plate?

04:14.522 --> 04:15.756
It's a rental.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.891
But the driver used
a fake ID and credit card.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.327
I have a BOLO out on the van.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.728
Yeah, this random burglary

04:20.828 --> 04:22.296
is sounding less random
by the second.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.964
Vance was targeted.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.266
And with two men on the loose,
he could still be in danger.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.504
Soon as I get there,
I'll call you, okay?

04:30.604 --> 04:31.672
Uh, I got to go.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.041
Director,
I think we got a problem.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.276
What is that?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.811
That's my luggage, Agent Parker.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.613
I know what it is.
Where are you going?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.248
Interpol Conference
in Berlin.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.350
I told you about it last week.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.717
You're still going to that?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.486
Of course I am.
I go every year. Yeah.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.987
Well, it's not every year

04:47.087 --> 04:48.989
that somebody breaks
into your home to kill you.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.159
We don't know that for sure.
Well, it's looking
more like it.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.494
And I think whoever broke in

04:53.594 --> 04:54.828
might not be
finished with you.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.330
I understand your concern,
Agent Parker,

04:56.430 --> 04:59.467
but I'm not gonna let a threat
stop me from doing my job.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.601
I got to say,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.102
I think this is a big mistake.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.605
You shouldn't go.
That's not
your call to make.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.840
Besides,
I won't be going alone.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.678
Olivia,
send them in, please.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.484
This is Agent Dominguez,
Agent Ford.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.486
They are my protection detail.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.354
Anything happens,
they'll be there.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.157
Hey. Alden Parker.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.426
Nice to meet you.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.495
You're dismissed.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.330
Parker...
Go!

05:31.432 --> 05:33.333
Wait outside.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.404
Hey!

05:36.504 --> 05:38.105
What the hell
are you doing?
You want to go to Berlin?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.473
Fine.
I'm going with you.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.208
I'll be your protection detail.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.443
You?
I'm qualified.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.877
No, you're overkill.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.479
You're a senior agent, Parker.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.381
Your place is
here with the team.
They'll be fine.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.917
Besides, I always
wanted to see Berlin.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.720
Plane leaves in an hour.
Your bags aren't even packed.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.523
I always keep
a go bag in my car.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.725
I'll go get it.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.579
Okay, we're good.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.180
Great.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.951
This way, Director.
Just keep moving.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.588
Don't we have to check in?
I... already did it.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.957
I took the liberty of
getting us adjoining rooms.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.625
How nice.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.062
Hey, um, I'd like to stop in
for a quick drink.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.329
It's been a long flight.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.798
We really should go
straight to the room.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.166
It's safer.
Parker, it's one drink.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.434
Besides,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.603
I want to scope out who's here

06:42.703 --> 06:44.772
at the conference.
Director, this way.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.973
Please?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.708
Should've brought
Torres instead.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.877
Director Vance!

06:49.977 --> 06:51.111
Hello.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey...

06:52.746 --> 06:53.947
It's okay, it's all right.
Stand down. I know her.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.583
It's good to see you, Director.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.918
You as well.
It's been too long.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.419
Uh, Agent Parker,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.354
allow me to introduce
Deputy Lena Paulsen

07:01.455 --> 07:03.557
of the German
Federal Intelligence Services.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.193
BND. You'll be attending
the conference as well?

07:06.293 --> 07:07.360
Oh, yes.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.529
I wouldn't miss the opportunity

07:08.629 --> 07:10.363
to talk shop with your director.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.365
He is a bit of a legend
in these parts.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.301
Deputy Paulsen and I
worked together years ago.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.137
Oh, I worked. You were
too busy eating strudel.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.675
Okay.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.310
Uh...

07:23.410 --> 07:25.479
I understand you'll be at the
cyberterrorism panel tomorrow?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.947
Yes, yeah, I'll be there.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.817
Then perhaps afterwards
we can talk some more.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.818
Yes.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.285
Until then, Deputy.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.854
Director.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.697
Hey, Jimmy.
McGee!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.298
Good to see you
changed your clothes.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.967
Yeah, well, I managed
to pop home for an hour.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.969
Couldn't keep working
in my sweats, you know?

07:49.069 --> 07:52.205
Yeah, especially now that
you're Acting NCIS Director.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.407
I read the memo. Congratulations.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.176
That's just until Vance
gets back.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.945
You don't sound too thrilled.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.212
Uh, to be honest with you,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.648
I'm...
kind of dreading it.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.382
I'm a field agent.
I don't want to be stuck

08:02.482 --> 08:03.684
behind a desk
dealing with politicians.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.719
Why not try to
enjoy this, you know?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.556
Embrace your newfound power.
You go on longer lunch breaks,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.357
use the private bathroom,

08:10.457 --> 08:11.892
maybe boss some people around.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.427
Okay, how about I start with
asking you for an update?

08:14.528 --> 08:17.297
Not exactly "bossy,"
but we'll work on it.

08:17.397 --> 08:18.599
Okay. Uh...

08:18.699 --> 08:21.001
No big mystery as to how
our victim died.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.170
This is what you get
if you mess with the director,

08:23.270 --> 08:24.672
a former boxing champ.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.974
Yeah, remind me never to get
on Vance's bad side.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.410
Anything so far as to who
our victim may be?
Possibly.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.981
He's had hair plugs
installed into his hairline.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.184
They're synthetic plastic plugs
which have been banned

08:37.284 --> 08:38.586
in the United States
for decades.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.187
But they're apparently
still quite popular

08:40.287 --> 08:43.190
in Eastern Europe, which is
possibly where he's from.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.461
Oh, Knight found
the robbers' van abandoned

08:48.562 --> 08:50.030
in a D.C. motel parking lot.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.365
We are bringing in
the motel owner now.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.267
Go get 'em, Director.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.608
How many times you gonna
sweep the room? It's clean.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.543
Never hurts to be thorough.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.682
You know, Agent Parker,
I can handle myself.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.519
It's not the first time that
my life has been threatened.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.622
First time on my watch.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.223
Okay, we're good.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.759
Good.
You hungry?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.193
I can order us
a couple of schnitzels.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.195
I'm just gonna turn in.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.764
It's been a long day.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.165
Well, you need anything,
I'll be, uh...

09:25.265 --> 09:27.901
Right next door, got it.
Thanks, Agent Parker.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.412
Hey.
I'm on my way.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.851
Yeah, okay, a little overpriced,
but that'll work.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.728
Oh!

09:58.832 --> 10:00.668
Going somewhere, Director?

10:00.768 --> 10:03.804
Deputy Paulsen's room
perhaps?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.572
I don't know what you mean.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.307
Come on, it's obvious.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.676
The way you couldn't
let go of each other

10:08.776 --> 10:09.943
when you said goodbye?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.912
The two of you
are having a fling.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.548
You've been secretly meeting up
at these conventions each year,

10:15.649 --> 10:16.984
booking rooms on the same floor,

10:17.084 --> 10:19.519
checking in and out
at the same time, eh?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.088
You got all that
from a handshake?

10:21.188 --> 10:23.657
That, and I ran
a background check on her.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.795
Why didn't you
tell me before?

10:27.895 --> 10:30.597
Well, because it's
none of your business.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.632
Uh, it is when your
life is in danger.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.601
Well, now that you know...

10:34.702 --> 10:36.303
can I count on your discretion?

10:36.403 --> 10:37.738
Hundred percent.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.008
But if you're planning
to see her tonight,

10:41.108 --> 10:43.210
I can't let you go alone.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.246
No. Absolutely not.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.015
This is not
a party for three.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.417
I don't need a chaperone.
All due respect,

10:50.517 --> 10:52.452
that's not your call to make.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.054
As long as you are
on foreign soil,

10:54.154 --> 10:55.355
you're my responsibility.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.858
Sorry, Director.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.659
That's the way it's got to be.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.965
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Sykes.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.433
We just have a few
questions about...

11:06.533 --> 11:08.101
Oh, yeah.
Oh, boy, oh, here we go.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.636
This is about
the <i>Dateline</i> exposé

11:09.737 --> 11:11.104
they did on my motel rooms,
isn't it?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
Look, I didn't know

11:12.873 --> 11:14.107
all that gunk was in there

11:14.207 --> 11:15.709
until they waved their
black lights around.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.944
You know, it's like
I told the reporters,

11:17.044 --> 11:18.511
I only rent the rooms,
you know?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.380
I-I can't control
what people do in 'em.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.749
People are animals.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
Mr. Sykes...
I know,

11:23.283 --> 11:25.185
it's a health hazard,
blah-blah-blah,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.887
but I-I swear to you,

11:26.987 --> 11:30.090
I got a brand-new cleaning lady
coming in first thing on Monday.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.291
Or Tuesday.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.193
As disgusting as that is,

11:33.293 --> 11:35.295
we are not interested
in your rooms.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.629
Oh.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.533
Forget I said anything, then.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.602
Yeah, I wish I could.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.072
Do you recognize that man?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.074
He would've been a guest
at your hotel with two others.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.743
Mm. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I remember.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.745
Uh, they came in a few days ago.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.513
Paid cash, kept to themselves,
you know.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.115
I didn't really
socialize with them.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.684
Do you remember
anything else?

11:57.785 --> 12:00.187
One of 'em talked funny.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.956
You know, had an accent.
Russian maybe.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.827
Sorry to interrupt,
but this couldn't wait...

12:08.361 --> 12:10.230
Is that the guy from
the <i>Dateline</i> exposé?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.266
Oof, seriously, dude, nasty.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.501
I'm cleaning it!

12:14.601 --> 12:15.635
Kasie, what's going on?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.037
I was able to track

12:17.137 --> 12:19.572
the fake credit card
used to rent the van.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.108
That same card
was used to book

12:21.208 --> 12:23.276
a flight out of Dulles
earlier this morning.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.112
To where?
Berlin.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.915
No such thing
as a coincidence.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.716
Can't believe this.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.552
What wine did you go with? Red?
Ah, it's a nice choice.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.855
Could you please
give me some space?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.623
Riesling
would've been good, too.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.724
You know, something German.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.327
Just saying.
Yeah, Torres.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.728
We found the two guys
that got away.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.296
They booked a flight to Berlin.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.565
Landed two hours ago.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.336
Lena?
Director!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.939
Stay back. Stay back.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.012
Lena! Lena!

13:00.413 --> 13:02.315
Oh, my God.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.984
Call an ambulance.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.118
I'm right here.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.787
Help is on the way.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.256
Lena, hang on.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.073
Director Vance?

13:26.173 --> 13:28.041
Frauke Biedermann
with the BND.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.711
I'm leading the investigation
into Deputy Paulsen's attack.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.881
How is she?
Still in intensive care.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.515
Lost a lot of blood.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.217
Is she conscious?
Can I see her?
They had to put her

13:37.317 --> 13:39.286
in an induced coma
to stabilize her.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.990
May I ask how you and the deputy
know each other?

13:43.090 --> 13:44.724
We're work colleagues.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.026
I see.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.896
And is it customary
for work colleagues

13:48.996 --> 13:51.764
to visit each other's
hotel rooms late at night?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.236
So, do you have
any suspects yet?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.737
We are still
processing the scene.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.572
What about
the hotel cameras?
Dismantled.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.209
But the attackers stole
the deputy's laptop and phone,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.311
so hopefully we can trace them.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.220
I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.055
Is there some way
I can reach you?

14:15.155 --> 14:18.191
Yeah, my cell number's
on the back.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.860
Thank you.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.063
Oh, one last thing.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.464
The paramedics mentioned

14:24.564 --> 14:27.000
the deputy kept repeating
the same word--

14:27.100 --> 14:28.501
Festung.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.439
It means "fortress" in German.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.307
Does that mean anything to you?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.410
No. I'm-I'm sorry.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.714
Had to ask.
We'll be in touch.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.686
We should have,
uh, told her

14:46.786 --> 14:48.321
about the break-in
at your house?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.523
It's clearly connected.
No. No, no, no.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.992
I think it's best
if we keep

14:52.092 --> 14:53.726
BND in the dark
until we know more. Right.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.996
Okay, first things first.
Let's get you back to D.C.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.198
I got us on a flight
leaving in two hours.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.200
I'm not leaving.
What?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.334
I got to find out who did this.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.236
You're not safe here in Berlin.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.771
If that was somebody
that you cared about

15:04.871 --> 15:06.940
laying in that hospital bed,
would you get on a plane?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.479
Okay.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.949
But if we stay, you got to be
straight with me.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.552
The word that
that deputy said, Festung?

15:20.553 --> 15:22.655
You know what it means,
don't you?

15:23.523 --> 15:26.459
It's how Lena and I met.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.431
So, Festung is the name of an op
that you and Deputy Paulsen ran?

15:31.531 --> 15:32.966
Six years ago.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.935
Prior to the op, our offices
in Europe were chasing

15:36.036 --> 15:39.472
a Chechen terrorist
named Goran Umarov.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.840
I know him. Bad dude.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.776
Tried to blow up
a U.S. naval base in France.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.746
Right. We had received a tip
that Umarov was hiding out

15:46.846 --> 15:48.481
in a small town
near the German border.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.550
We coordinated with the BND
to bring him in.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.387
Deputy Paulsen and I
put the classified op together.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.722
So, what happened?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.657
Umarov didn't want
to go down quietly.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.526
There was gunfire,
he was killed.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.261
Whoever came after you
and the deputy

16:01.361 --> 16:02.762
is obviously connected
to that op.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.197
Maybe payback?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.333
Yeah, but why now?
Six years later?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.535
Dig into Umarov's
family history.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.770
See who's still around
that may want payback.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.406
Also, we're gonna need to learn
everything we can

16:13.506 --> 16:14.907
about this Operation Festung.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.710
Talk to someone who was actually
there on the ground.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.346
All right, being that it was
classified, Director,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.081
we'll need access
to those files.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.482
You'll have them.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.017
Uh, in the meantime,
I'm gonna need one of you

16:24.117 --> 16:26.819
to find the closest
beauty supply store in Berlin.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.522
Why?

16:31.558 --> 16:33.893
You don't want to know.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.798
It's a neat little trick.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.368
Where'd you learn that?
The FBI?

16:41.468 --> 16:42.669
Tenth grade.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.871
Used to remove labels
from beer bottles,

16:44.971 --> 16:46.506
pretend they were soda.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.042
Well, if you don't want to see
the inside of a German prison,

16:49.142 --> 16:50.377
I suggest you mach schnell.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.145
Jawohl, Director.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.782
Ah, like butter.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.994
Yeah, looks like
the Germans

17:08.095 --> 17:09.829
went through this
with a fine-tooth comb.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.865
Yeah, then we'll just have
to find what they missed.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.902
I've been thinking.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.570
Whoever attacked
me and Lena--

17:17.670 --> 17:19.172
they weren't seeking revenge,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.374
or they would've just
killed me back at the house.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.742
They were looking for something.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.578
Yeah, maybe
they already found it.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.115
Agent Biedermann did say
that they stole

17:28.215 --> 17:30.016
the deputy's laptop and phone.

17:30.117 --> 17:33.620
No, Lena would never hide
anything important in those.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.055
She's way too smart for that.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.359
She means a lot to you, huh?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.328
We talked the whole time.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.165
I used to look forward
to these conferences

17:45.265 --> 17:47.134
just so I could see her again.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.236
It's the best part of my year.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.172
You ever wish it was more
than just once a year?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.342
We'd been discussing it,

17:55.442 --> 17:56.976
taking the next step.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.147
I was actually gonna bring it up
to her again

18:00.247 --> 18:02.115
on this trip, but...

18:06.686 --> 18:09.122
Director, you all right?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.659
The position of her body--

18:12.759 --> 18:13.893
it's all wrong.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.363
How do you mean?
Look at the blood trail.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.398
After she was shot,

18:18.498 --> 18:20.267
she crawled toward
the credenza.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.668
So?
So...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.770
the phone is on the other end
of the room.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.373
Shouldn't she have been
crawling toward the phone

18:26.473 --> 18:28.141
to call for help
instead of away from it?

18:34.381 --> 18:37.116
What do you got?
Bible.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.018
Okay.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.687
She's shot,
she thinks she's dying,

18:40.787 --> 18:43.990
so she needs the comfort
of the Good Book.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.659
Not likely.
Lena is a Buddhist.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.097
That's Lena's handwriting.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.701
Why is a Buddhist
writing down Bible verses?

18:57.036 --> 18:59.138
Hey, guys.
Wow!

18:59.239 --> 19:00.673
Acting Director McGee.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.075
What brings you down
to our humble squad room, sir?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.811
I'm dropping off some
of Vance's files here.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.679
I'd thought I'd see
how you guys are doing.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.981
See that, Jess?
Even at the top of Olympus,

19:09.081 --> 19:10.983
he never forgets
about us little guys.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.454
Yeah, shouldn't you be off
doing your director duties?

19:14.554 --> 19:16.689
Oh, please, I've been
trying to avoid

19:16.789 --> 19:18.691
the director's
assistant for hours.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.528
So, any luck tracking anyone
on Vance's op or...?

19:21.628 --> 19:22.862
I wouldn't know.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.331
I can't even read this thing.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.333
Half of it it's either redacted
or in German.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.269
How come we're not talking
about the elephant in the room?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.570
What's the elephant in the room?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.071
Vance and the deputy.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.875
What was he doing
in her hotel room at night?

19:35.975 --> 19:38.110
Well, two people attending
the same conference.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.712
They could just be
exchanging ideas.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.714
Oh, they were
exchanging something.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.984
Oh, heads up.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.986
Vance's assistant at your three.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.290
Acting Director McGee, I have
been looking all over for you.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.658
Um, I was just...

19:51.758 --> 19:53.092
Fraternizing with the agents?

19:53.192 --> 19:56.263
Need I remind you, you have
a full plate today--

19:56.363 --> 19:57.964
budget meeting at 4:00,
Zoom with the DoD at 5:00,

19:58.064 --> 20:00.132
and you're late for a lunch
with Senator Roskin.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.969
Is there any way we can
maybe reschedule all that?

20:06.273 --> 20:08.040
I'll see you guys later.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.642
Bye, Tim.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.582
Thank you, Kasie.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.784
She just tracked down a name
I pulled from the files.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.952
An NCIS agent who worked
on the op in Germany.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.456
Where is he now?
He is retired. In D.C.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.558
Works part-time
as a technical advisor.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.726
For the military?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.761
Not exactly.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.797
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

20:31.731 --> 20:33.500
And... cut!

20:35.001 --> 20:36.636
All right, that's lunch!

20:36.736 --> 20:39.071
Well, thank you for seeing us,
Mr. Newcastle.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.540
Oh, call me Phil.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.109
Always happy to help out
my NCIS family.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.978
If you don't mind me asking,
what exactly do you do here?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.547
Well, basically
I advise production

20:47.647 --> 20:48.948
on how to make things
look legit.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.350
You know, tell them
the right jargon,

20:50.450 --> 20:52.184
make sure they hold
the weapons properly.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.185
Is the movie any good?

20:53.286 --> 20:54.721
It's a piece of crap.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.789
Half the stuff
on the script

20:56.889 --> 20:58.157
would never happen in real life.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.693
Hey, checks don't bounce
and the food's good.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.161
Um, so, Phil,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.031
we had spoke on the phone
about Operation Festung?

21:05.131 --> 21:07.567
Oh, yeah. Vance's German op.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.101
So, uh, what do you remember?

21:09.201 --> 21:11.871
We were to take down
this terrorist Goran Umarov.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.473
I was assigned to lead the raid.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.707
On Umarov's house?
Yeah.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.643
German intel
had Umarov staying there

21:16.743 --> 21:19.178
with his girlfriend
and three of his guys.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.348
We went in at dawn with orders
to take them alive.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.082
So, what happened?
Well, one of my guys

21:23.182 --> 21:24.684
accidentally triggered
the alarm.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.486
Umarov came out, guns blazing.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.120
We returned fire.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.323
After the smoke was cleared,
all five in the house were dead.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.758
Messy.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.626
Is there anything else
that you can remember?

21:33.726 --> 21:36.095
Well, yeah.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.664
The diamonds.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.199
Diamonds?
Yeah.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.702
After the raid,
we went through Umarov's loot,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.705
found a stash of diamonds
in a coffee can.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.508
Two, three million. Easy.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.444
We didn't read anything
in the file about diamonds.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.681
Well, they were there.
I saw 'em with my own eyes.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.883
<i>Okay, Kasie's emailing me</i>

21:56.983 --> 21:58.818
the evidence logs
from the files.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.220
$3 million in diamonds
doesn't just go missing.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.622
Somebody took them.

22:02.722 --> 22:03.890
Yeah, it could be what
our bad guys are after.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.226
Oh, got it.
Let's see.

22:07.326 --> 22:11.297
Any mentions
of the diamonds?
No.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.800
And guess who signed off

22:13.900 --> 22:16.202
on the evidence logs.
Deputy Paulsen.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.372
She would've been the last
person to see the diamonds.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.640
Which means...

22:20.740 --> 22:24.076
Maybe Vance's girlfriend
wasn't a victim.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.113
Maybe she's a thief.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.559
Uh, me, too, me, too.
I had a wonderful time, yeah.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.495
Well, if you keep ordering
bottles of wine like that,

22:42.595 --> 22:43.763
I just may have to.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.532
That could be arranged.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.166
Now, listen, I've got to run,

22:47.266 --> 22:48.768
but before I do,
I just want to know,

22:48.868 --> 22:52.138
do I have your support
for that extra funding?

22:52.238 --> 22:53.139
Count on it.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.274
Great, great.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.776
No, thank you, Senator.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.812
And, uh, say hi to Trish
and the kids for me, okay?

23:01.313 --> 23:02.515
Sorry, guys.
Where were we?

23:02.615 --> 23:03.716
My man!

23:03.816 --> 23:05.552
In the big chair!

23:05.652 --> 23:08.254
Yeah, McGee. You've really
taken to your new role here.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.856
It was just a phone call.
I don't know.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.591
You look pretty comfy
behind that desk.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.859
Yeah, what's next, huh?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.060
You gonna rearrange
the furniture?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.428
Okay, did you come up here

23:15.528 --> 23:16.729
to give me an update
or to bust my chops?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.030
Both.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.600
Uh, so we believe that

23:20.700 --> 23:23.235
Deputy Paulsen stole
millions in diamonds

23:23.335 --> 23:25.037
from the raid on Goran Umarov.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.174
She falsified the evidence
logs to cover it up.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.176
Well, how can you be sure
it was her?

23:30.276 --> 23:31.711
Days after the raid,

23:31.811 --> 23:33.980
the deputy took an unplanned
trip to Antwerp, Belgium.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.147
And what's at Antwerp?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.650
Well, besides waffles?
Diamonds.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.385
It's the diamond capital
of the world.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.187
Yeah, it isn't
looking good.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.421
All right.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.723
So our deputy took the diamonds,

23:43.823 --> 23:45.291
and now our bad guys
want them back.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.793
Any idea yet who
these guys are?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.027
Uh, we know one.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.497
Goran's older brother
Sergei Umarov.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.031
Kasie ran facial recognition

23:52.131 --> 23:54.133
on the two guys who boarded
the flight to Berlin.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.502
We got one direct match.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.803
Sergei's the real deal.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.571
Former leader
of the Chechen mafia,

23:58.671 --> 24:00.740
wanted for sex trafficking,
arms smuggling.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.042
And seven years ago,
Sergei was arrested by Interpol

24:03.142 --> 24:05.912
and had been rotting away
in a Turkish prison.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.446
So he broke out
about two months ago,

24:07.547 --> 24:08.715
which would explain...

24:08.815 --> 24:10.349
Why Sergei is after
the diamonds now.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.485
Okay, do we know
where the diamonds are?
Not yet.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.453
But Kasie's working
on those Bible verses

24:14.554 --> 24:15.722
that Vance and Parker found.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.123
Maybe they'll give us something.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.625
Well, let's hope so.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.326
If we can find the diamonds
before Sergei does,

24:20.426 --> 24:21.360
we can use them to

24:21.460 --> 24:22.895
bait him and catch him.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.565
Yeah, but first, uh...
we may have another problem.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.567
Somebody's gonna have
to tell Vance that

24:27.667 --> 24:29.669
his lady friend is a thief?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.739
Oh...
I forgot about that one.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.749
Sorry.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.685
Couldn't have been easy
taking that call.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.591
You just... you take a second.
I'll be outside.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.595
You know, back
when I was an agent,

24:55.695 --> 24:58.397
I used to look at the
older guys in the office.

25:00.132 --> 25:03.369
Most of them were single,
they were drinkers...

25:03.469 --> 25:05.705
married to the job.

25:06.639 --> 25:09.776
I always wondered
if I would end up that way.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.612
You didn't end up like them.
You got married, had a family.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.614
Yeah, but now I'm alone
in that big house.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.016
Job's all I got left.

25:21.253 --> 25:26.358
Yeah, my ex left, and I-I filled
my time with all these hobbies--

25:26.458 --> 25:28.695
pastries,
birdwatching, piano.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.896
You play the piano?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.965
Like a fiend.
Doesn't matter, though.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.002
It's just, sometimes
I think it's...

25:36.102 --> 25:38.170
just a distraction.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.806
You miss being married?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.142
Know what I miss?

25:43.242 --> 25:45.044
Going to the movies with her.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.479
We used to go
to this revival house

25:47.580 --> 25:49.582
around the corner
and see the classics.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.284
Sucks going to the movies alone.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.920
Oh, yeah.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.789
Sitting there...
the lights come down,

25:56.889 --> 26:00.026
surrounded by all these couples?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.461
Pretending to read
the back of the Goobers box

26:02.561 --> 26:04.731
that you brought in?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.869
I guess I was hoping things
would be different with Lena.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.139
Was hoping
I wouldn't be alone anymore.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.944
Maybe you're not
as alone as you think.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.580
I'll be outside.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.057
Agent Parker.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.059
I would have thought you'd
be back in D.C. by now.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.528
Yeah, we've got some unfinished
business in Berlin.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.730
Your director,

26:37.830 --> 26:39.799
I take it he and the deputy

26:39.899 --> 26:42.802
were more than
just work colleagues?

26:45.304 --> 26:46.605
Lena was my mentor.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.676
She trained me at the academy.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.813
Like your director,
I care about her very much.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.216
So maybe we can help each other.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.951
How do you mean?

26:59.051 --> 27:01.120
I'm a good cop.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.455
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.795
Sorry, I got to take this.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.931
Uh, to be continued?
I hope so.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.468
Yeah, Kasie.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.505
Oh-ho-ho, that is
Sister Kasie to you

27:19.605 --> 27:22.041
because I am ready
to join a convent.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.209
I have spent

27:23.309 --> 27:25.011
hours trying to figure out

27:25.111 --> 27:27.346
the passages Deputy Paulsen
scribbled down.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.916
It's like
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i> up in here.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.450
But you cracked it, right?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.952
Tell me you cracked it. Ah...

27:33.052 --> 27:36.355
"He that is patient
is governed by much wisdom."

27:36.455 --> 27:38.858
Proverbs 14:29.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.026
Kasie...

27:40.126 --> 27:42.394
Okay, all right.
Yes, I cracked it, okay?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.730
Turns out,

27:43.830 --> 27:45.698
when the deputy
wrote down a passage,

27:45.798 --> 27:49.168
say, um, Second Kings
chapter 14, verse five,

27:49.268 --> 27:53.205
she wasn't telling us to go to
the passage and find the clue.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.474
The numbers were the clue.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.977
Two, 14, five.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.579
When you put all the numbers
from the Bible passages

28:00.679 --> 28:03.115
together in a row,
you get a bank account

28:03.215 --> 28:07.720
and a routing number,
specifically a bank in Berlin.

28:07.820 --> 28:11.791
I checked the account and, uh...
it's big.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.793
Let me guess, $3 million big. Yup.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.528
All right, hallelujah, Kasie.
You did it.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.431
Deputy Paulsen must have
sold the diamonds

28:19.531 --> 28:20.599
and deposited the money.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.700
Only the account

28:21.801 --> 28:23.669
isn't in the deputy's name.

28:23.770 --> 28:27.506
It belongs to someone
named Elisabeth Wenders.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.909
Wenders? Who is that, a partner?

28:30.009 --> 28:30.877
Beats me.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.378
But she lives outside of Berlin.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.246
You got an address?

28:35.681 --> 28:37.784
Hey, Jimmy.
Oh, McGee.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.752
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

28:39.852 --> 28:42.088
Well, I...
was gonna make an excuse

28:42.188 --> 28:43.990
about dropping off
some forms, but, uh...

28:44.090 --> 28:46.192
I guess I really
just want to talk.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.259
Oh.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.295
Pull up a slab.
What's up?

28:49.395 --> 28:52.531
Is it, uh, acting director
stuff? You still hating it?

28:52.631 --> 28:55.434
Actually... I don't.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.536
No, I kind of surprised myself.

28:57.636 --> 29:00.239
Talking to senators and dealing
with big picture stuff,

29:00.339 --> 29:03.275
I'm actually...
I'm actually pretty good at it.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.011
I am not surprised.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.313
Being a director definitely
plays to your strengths.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.781
Oh.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.282
You know, when Gibbs left,

29:10.382 --> 29:11.918
there was talk of me
stepping into his position.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.986
I turned it down because
I didn't want to

29:14.086 --> 29:16.889
have to make the choice between,
you know, family and work.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.690
But being director?

29:18.791 --> 29:20.292
You thinking of a career change?

29:20.392 --> 29:21.660
Well, I-- Let's be clear.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.863
I'm not angling for
the director's job here.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.364
I love being an agent,

29:25.464 --> 29:28.667
I love Vance, and hopefully
he will be here forever.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.837
And when forever ends?

29:35.374 --> 29:36.475
This is it.

29:36.575 --> 29:40.246
Elisabeth Wenders,
56 Osterstrasse.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.950
Do you think this is, uh,
Lena's partner in crime?

29:44.050 --> 29:46.953
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.720
Director, it's still my job
to protect you,

29:48.821 --> 29:51.057
but in case I can't...

30:14.513 --> 30:15.882
Okay, ma'am.
It's okay.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.283
Hey, hold on.
Who are you? What do you want?!

30:17.383 --> 30:19.518
It's okay.
My name is
Alden Parker.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.387
This is Director Leon Vance.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.957
We are with the U.S. Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.293
Oh.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.827
Uh, Leon.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.465
My sister has told me
a lot about you.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.167
You're Lena Paulsen's sister?

30:35.267 --> 30:36.302
Yes.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.171
But why are you here?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.008
The diamonds that
your sister stole?

30:42.108 --> 30:43.742
There's some bad people
looking to get 'em back,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.245
and they've already put Lena
in the hospital.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.846
Oh, my God.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.849
And you could be next unless
you tell us what is going on.

30:51.817 --> 30:52.985
The people who hurt Lena...

30:53.085 --> 30:55.354
they don't want the diamonds.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.889
They want her.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.460
Why, is she your daughter?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.895
No.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.065
She's Lena's.

31:19.145 --> 31:22.648
Six years ago, after the raid
on Goran Umarov was over,

31:22.748 --> 31:24.750
Lena went to his house
to assess the damage.

31:24.850 --> 31:27.386
She heard crying coming from
a closet in the back room,

31:27.486 --> 31:29.655
and that's where
she found Heidi.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.690
She was only a
few months old,

31:31.790 --> 31:34.060
stashed under a pile
of dirty clothes.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.827
Malnourished, neglected.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.096
So, it was Goran's baby?

31:37.196 --> 31:39.498
Yes. And Lena
didn't know what to do.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.633
The child couldn't go
to Goran's next of kin.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.102
The Umarovs are monsters.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.372
Giving Heidi to them
would have been too cruel.

31:46.472 --> 31:47.873
So Lena raised
the baby as her own.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.742
And enlisted you
to help keep her secret.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.046
What my sister did
was the right choice.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.347
It was the noble choice.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.083
No.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.086
It was criminal.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.587
Your sister broke the law.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.389
She stole evidence.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.757
She withheld crucial
information from the BND.

32:05.857 --> 32:06.959
From me.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.227
The diamonds were Goran's.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.529
They had been
in his family for years.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.931
Lena simply took what was
rightfully Heidi's

32:13.032 --> 32:15.667
and put it
in a trust fund for her.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.903
Lena never touched
a dime of that money.

32:18.004 --> 32:21.340
Still, she could've told me
about the child.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.608
She lied to me.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.310
Yes.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.713
And she always
hated herself for that.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.251
She was only trying
to protect Heidi,

32:32.351 --> 32:35.387
to give her a better life.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.889
Surely, as a parent,
you can understand that.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.860
Well, despite your...

32:41.960 --> 32:43.362
your good intentions,
Ms. Wenders,

32:43.462 --> 32:44.930
unfortunately
your secret is out.

32:45.031 --> 32:48.234
Goran's brother knows about
Heidi and he's looking for her.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.136
And if we can find her,
so can he.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.503
So, what are we going to do?

32:51.603 --> 32:53.005
We need to get
the two of you out of here

32:53.105 --> 32:54.473
and go someplace safe.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.075
Agreed. But where?

32:56.175 --> 32:59.111
Nearest NCIS safe house is
a thousand miles from here.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.281
Great.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.949
Yeah, text me the address. Thanks.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.052
McGee came through.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.386
BND is gonna let us use

33:07.486 --> 33:09.421
one of their safe houses,
no questions asked.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.190
That was fast.
How did he manage that?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.924
Apparently our acting director

33:13.025 --> 33:15.594
has some, uh, friends
in high places.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.129
Yeah, he's probably already
rearranged the furniture.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.297
Heidi...

33:19.898 --> 33:20.732
<i>Nein.</i>

33:20.832 --> 33:22.334
<i>Nein.</i>

33:22.434 --> 33:23.635
Problem?

33:23.735 --> 33:25.404
She doesn't want to leave.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.838
And she's scared.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.607
I've tried explaining it
to her, but...

33:28.707 --> 33:30.042
Do you mind if I talk to her?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.489
Ah.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.206
Mm-hmm.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.509
Not...

34:03.609 --> 34:05.477
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i> Okay.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.314
Um...

34:08.414 --> 34:11.083
Okay, how do you say
"Smokey" in German? Um...

34:11.183 --> 34:14.320
Smokey.
I speak English, you know.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.921
Thank God.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.524
Your aunt,

34:18.624 --> 34:20.859
did she tell you anything
about what's going on?

34:20.959 --> 34:23.329
Some bad people hurt Mommy.

34:23.429 --> 34:27.633
But those bad people who hurt
her are on their way here.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.301
And that's why
we need to leave now.

34:29.401 --> 34:33.239
What if they hurt me?
No, I'm not gonna let
that happen.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.974
Your mom has always
protected you,

34:36.074 --> 34:37.776
and so will I.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.279
But I'm gonna need you
to trust me.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.880
Can you do that?

34:43.982 --> 34:45.317
Nick. Hey.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.653
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, you speak
to Parker?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.255
Yeah, I just got off
the phone with him.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.057
He is headed to the safe house
now with the girl and the aunt.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.492
Oh, that's a relief.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.594
All we got to worry about
now is finding Sergei Umarov.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.263
Well, you might not
have to look too far.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.931
We tracked the ID
Sergei has been using in Berlin.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.768
He rented another car,
and, using his GPS,

35:02.868 --> 35:04.903
I may be able to find
Sergei's current location.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.805
Great. Then we can call BND
to pick 'em up.

35:06.905 --> 35:11.076
Yeah, just finishing up
the trace now and... boom.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.879
McGEE:
Where is that?

35:13.979 --> 35:16.982
Looks like it's in the
industrial part of Berlin.

35:17.082 --> 35:20.051
Some old factory called
the Ekkehart...

35:20.152 --> 35:21.953
Power Station?
Wait, you've heard of it?

35:22.053 --> 35:23.922
That's where BND said
the safe house is.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.892
Wait, Sergei's at
the safe house now?

35:26.992 --> 35:29.528
Parker and Vance are headed
right towards them.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.969
Did you know
she was gonna be here?

35:38.069 --> 35:39.938
Nobody said anything to me.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.008
Okay, just, uh...

35:43.108 --> 35:44.743
Just wait in the car. Okay.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.781
Agent Biedermann.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.917
BND never told us
you were gonna be here.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.887
I'm in charge of this case.
Of course I'd be here.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.789
You know how much
this means to me.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.458
We have everything
set up for you inside.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.660
You'll have
round-the-clock protection.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.961
Good.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.397
Yeah, McGee.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.866
Is the girl with you?

36:11.703 --> 36:14.373
We never told BND
about the girl.

36:15.307 --> 36:18.877
Hey, Parker! Parker!

36:20.746 --> 36:22.381
Sergei's here!
Let's go, let's go!

36:30.656 --> 36:32.758
Stop, stop!
You'll hit the girl!

36:32.858 --> 36:34.159
Okay, you okay?

36:34.260 --> 36:35.727
I think so.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.464
Come on, get out.
Run as fast as you can.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.332
Let's go. Let's go.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.510
I got right.
I got left.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.878
Let's go!

37:05.491 --> 37:06.758
Sergei's running.
I got him.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.727
Go!
Cover me.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.201
Hey.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.969
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. Come with me.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.338
Come on. Let's go.
This way.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.672
Let's go. Let's go!

37:40.959 --> 37:43.228
This way, this way.
Let's go.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.530
This way. Let's go.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.432
Stay with me, stay with me.
Stay close.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.270
Heidi.

37:53.639 --> 37:54.873
All right.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.446
Heidi.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.147
No.
Shh, shh.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.215
I'm here to take you home.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.585
Damn it.

38:06.685 --> 38:07.953
Heidi.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.156
It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you, okay?

38:11.256 --> 38:13.291
Trust me.

38:13.392 --> 38:17.162
Heidi.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.048
Found you.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.057
Hey!

38:54.766 --> 38:56.868
Oh-ho.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.070
You okay?

39:00.472 --> 39:02.007
He's in there.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.515
Hey.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.918
Hey, uh...

39:13.018 --> 39:14.720
thanks for letting me
borrow him.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.589
He's a very brave
little bear.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.925
Here.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.395
Just like you.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.480
Leon.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.149
Hey. How are you feeling?

39:44.249 --> 39:47.853
Um, how do you Americans say it?

39:47.953 --> 39:50.556
I have been hit by the truck?

39:55.827 --> 39:59.197
Lena, you should know,

39:59.297 --> 40:02.434
everything's gonna be
all right now.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.570
Heidi is safe.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.839
No one's gonna come
after her again.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.743
Oh, I am... I'm so sorry, Leon.

40:11.843 --> 40:12.744
No.
I never meant...

40:12.844 --> 40:15.080
It's okay.
No, no.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.083
I should have told you.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.754
But I only wanted to do
what was best for her.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.423
I understand.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.826
You were protecting
somebody that you love.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.829
There is so much
I want to tell you.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.297
I...
No, no.

40:32.397 --> 40:33.999
Save your energy.
Save your energy.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.067
We'll talk later.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.609
Will there be a later?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.249
I almost forgot.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.384
There's someone
who wants to see you.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.390
Mommy.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.461
Heidi.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.377
Okay, got it. Thanks.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.680
McGee spoke with
the head of BND.

41:21.780 --> 41:25.050
Turns out that Agent Biedermann
was on Sergei's payroll

41:25.150 --> 41:26.752
and that's how
he learned about the op

41:26.852 --> 41:28.620
and yours
and Lena's involvement.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.723
Well, I guess there's only
one question left, then.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.596
What do we do about her?
She broke the law.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.632
Well, I think that the BND

41:40.732 --> 41:42.901
is more interested
in their mole problem

41:43.001 --> 41:44.870
than a little girl
being given a better life

41:44.970 --> 41:46.972
by someone doing
the right thing.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.109
And if the BND comes around
and starts asking questions?

41:53.812 --> 41:55.480
You'll know what to do.

42:02.721 --> 42:06.257
Anyway, we should, uh, grab
a flight and head home.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.059
Although McGee said
not to rush it.

42:08.159 --> 42:11.229
Yeah, I bet.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.865
You know, I noticed
that there's a...

42:13.965 --> 42:15.667
movie theater near the hotel.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.636
It's playing <i>The Third Man.</i>

42:18.469 --> 42:20.839
Orson Welles, ooh,
Joseph Cotten.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.073
That's a classic.
Mm-hmm.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.009
You feel like
catching a flick?

42:24.109 --> 42:27.613
Sure, why not, Director?
Call me Leon.

42:29.314 --> 42:31.349
Let's go to the movies.
