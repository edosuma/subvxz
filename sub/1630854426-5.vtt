00:06.080 --> 00:07.320
- Okay, are you ready?
- Are you ready?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.360
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.720
- Go.
- Okay, let's go.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.520
- Hi, I'm Jamie.
- And I'm Amandine.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.560
We've spent
our entire life savings on vodka.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.920
And chocolate.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.200
And now we've got nothing.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.800
- Zero.
- Zero.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.840
Zilch.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.280
- So, what are we doing?
- Our manifesto.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.520
Yes. Our manifesto.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.880
- Fuck your manifesto!

00:25.960 --> 00:27.400
- Okay, are we doing this?
- Yeah.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.800
Really? Okay, okay, okay, all right.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.760
Okay, manifesto, right.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.360
Number one.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.480
Love is impossible!

00:38.520 --> 00:40.120
- Number two.
- Number two.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.120
If love is impossible, we must...

00:43.200 --> 00:45.560
- believe in the impossible.
- Believe in the impossible.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.720
- We must believe in magic.
- We must believe in magic.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.400
So, you decided
to come alone this week?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.920
I know how busy Jamie's been.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.440
How did it go, by the way, the opening?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.160
How did it go?

01:08.240 --> 01:09.080
Um...

01:12.040 --> 01:13.200
...it was a triumph.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.400
Well, it's good for us
to get this time alone.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.080
Gives me a chance
to hear things from your perspective.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.360
Jamie's gone.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.440
What do you mean?

01:27.640 --> 01:28.760
I mean he left.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
He's gone.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.680
Amandine,
before you say anything further,

01:34.760 --> 01:37.040
I should remind you,
I'm a grief therapist.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.240
I'm not a relationship therapist.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.960
What's the difference?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.320
- Jamie?

01:49.200 --> 01:50.840
I've made you a bacon butty.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.840
I'll leave it outside the door.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.800
- Go on.
- See you in a bit.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.160
She's gonna miss you.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.920
I'll be back tomorrow night.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.240
- Yeah.
- All right, love you.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.320
- Bye.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.600
Eyes peeled.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.600
Horse!

02:43.680 --> 02:45.320
- Where?
- Right.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.040
- Damn.
- That's for me. Thank you.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.080
- Oh, there's a deer!
- Where?

02:50.160 --> 02:51.360
There!

02:51.440 --> 02:53.520
I don't think
I'm gonna be able to top that.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.800
Look! There's the Gruffalo!

02:55.880 --> 02:58.080
All right,
how many points for the Gruffalo?

02:58.160 --> 03:00.520
- Ten thousand!
- Ten thousand?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.920
- Hey!
- Hi, Auntie Lue!

03:17.240 --> 03:18.120
Dad!

03:20.440 --> 03:21.880
Hello, my pumpkin.

03:21.960 --> 03:22.880
Ah!

03:24.320 --> 03:25.760
Hey, pumpkin.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.960
Ah.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.880
You okay?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.400
- Are you crying?
- What?

03:31.480 --> 03:32.600
No. I'm not crying.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.200
Look, I just... I just missed you,
that's all.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.240
Hey, Greta.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.360
We've got goats!

03:37.440 --> 03:38.840
Goats? Where?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.200
Round the back.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.080
- Can I go see the goats, Dad?
- Yeah. Of course you can.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.640
- Does she need wellies?
- No, course not.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.240
Come on. Look, monkey.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.120
Jamie.

03:51.960 --> 03:52.840
Jack.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.000
Thanks.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.040
You look good.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.800
- I mean, not as bad as I thought you...
- How much does Greta know?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.200
She thinks you're exhausted,
taking a few days.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.640
And she hasn't said anything?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.840
No. I think she's good.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.680
Good.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.520
Good.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.160
So, you saw her?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.480
Hmm-mm. Yeah.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.200
- Jamie, I don't think...
- No, yeah, I got it.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.760
- You know. It's just, caught...
- Yeah.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.360
...in the middle a bit,
and then, you know.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.920
- I understand.
- And then...

04:46.640 --> 04:48.360
But yeah, yeah, no, I saw her.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.480
And we spoke before that.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.080
When?

04:55.160 --> 04:57.120
Well, she called me.
She called me that night.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.720
- She called you?
- Yeah.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.040
Why?

05:02.120 --> 05:04.080
Jamie,
we speak on the phone all the time.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.880
- Yeah, about Greta.
- Yeah, sure, and other things.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.000
We're mates.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.360
Did you know?

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
- Know about what?
- Did you?

05:12.560 --> 05:16.040
Did you know, about fucking Dave,
about Jason Burke, did you?

05:16.120 --> 05:17.800
- Jamie...
- Did you know?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.640
Look, I really don't wanna get
caught up in all this.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.600
That's great, no, I...
That's fucking perfect, that is.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.080
- Look, I...
- Who's Paul?

05:24.160 --> 05:25.520
- Jamie.
- Do you fucking know?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.160
I've fucked up
my relationship with her once,

05:27.240 --> 05:28.640
- I don't wanna fuck it up again!
- Do you know who Paul is?

05:28.720 --> 05:29.960
- No, no. Listen...
- Do you know?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.680
- Is it fucking you? Is it fucking you?
- I'm Jack.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.840
- If you're Paul...
- Who she left, for you.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.120
You fucking tool.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.600
Come on, man.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.320
I loved Amandine.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.400
I mean, I really loved her.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.960
And I fucked it up.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.040
And I'd give half my dad's money
to try and change that.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.280
I dunno what's going on
between you two, right,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.920
it's none of my business.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.600
But this is the biggest week of your

06:03.680 --> 06:05.160
life and you're holed up
in the back of beyond

06:05.240 --> 06:06.840
with your head up your ass.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.240
I mean, what's the plan, mate?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.520
Blow up your marriage?

06:09.600 --> 06:10.800
Blow up your career?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.280
And where does that leave Greta?

06:13.360 --> 06:14.680
I know, yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.920
I'm sorry. You've been amazing.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.320
You know what? Actually, I have.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.520
And I haven't done it for you
and I haven't done it for Amandine,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.400
I've done it for her,
I've done it for Greta.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.200
I don't know how you do it, mate,
but you've gotta sort this out, fast.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.840
It's time for you to step up, Jamie.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.040
- Time for you to work your magic.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.400
Dad, Jack, I met a goat!

06:36.480 --> 06:38.000
Here she is. The tiny terror.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.760
Can I get a goat, Dad,
if Mum says yes?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.560
- Mm?
- Dad, can we get a goat?

06:42.640 --> 06:45.400
- We'll see.
- When he says that, it means yes.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.040
Right, I'm gonna skip.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.640
I'll see you later, Lue.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.200
- Take care.
- Come here, you.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.920
Ah! You got me, you got me,
the biggest hug ever!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.880
- I love you, Jack.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.200
I love you too, my darling.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.840
Right, I'm off.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.280
I'll be right back, okay?

07:02.920 --> 07:05.080
You know, if I know Amandine,

07:05.160 --> 07:08.680
and I do, and, uh, if she did this,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.080
which, let's face it,
she did, then, uh...

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
Then what?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.800
Then she must've had a reason.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.760
What do you mean, a reason?

07:18.840 --> 07:19.880
I've gotta go.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.480
Jack... thank you.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.920
Any time.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.760
So, you chose Jamie?

07:50.680 --> 07:54.080
I married Jamie
and he became Greta's father.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.720
- Wah!

07:59.360 --> 08:00.960
Come on Daddy, come on!

08:04.160 --> 08:06.000
And then you betrayed him.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.720
What do you mean?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.240
I think you know
what I mean, Amandine.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.840
You slept with other men.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.600
You had sex with three other men.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.720
Oh.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.360
I see what you mean.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.440
Yes.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.760
Hello, it's me.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.600
I forgot to say, today is the first
of the month, so pinch, punch.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.000
You may remember
that on the first of the last month,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.760
I came to you
and said I needed you to explain why

08:41.880 --> 08:43.520
it was you were so distant.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.080
Why when I speak
it's like you're not listening.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.040
When you come back
from walks, it's like...

08:53.440 --> 08:54.880
like you're back, but you're not.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.960
And I said I was giving you
a month to at least say something,

09:00.760 --> 09:03.320
anything, about what's wrong.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.240
Well...

09:06.200 --> 09:08.840
...today's a new month,
and so I need to know.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.880
I need to know, Lue.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.280
In 1928, Coco met Madeleine Vionnet,

09:24.360 --> 09:26.760
the revolutionary designer of her time,

09:31.520 --> 09:34.520
but just as influential
to the world of fashion.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.640
It makes it cling to the body.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.640
It makes it flow.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.040
Elastic.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.080
Cut the fabric, I cut the fabric,
I cut the fabric, I cut the fabric.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.760
This cut is wrong.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.520
I cut the fabric
at 45 degrees to the weft.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.600
Makes it flow.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.760
Makes it cling to the body.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.760
Who taught you this idea?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.480
It's my own, Mademoiselle Chanel.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.200
It's called the bias cut.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.760
What did you say your name was again?

10:20.840 --> 10:21.760
Madeleine.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.880
My name is Madeleine.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.120
Thanks.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.440
Madam.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.640
Hello.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.840
Just needs more flow.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.600
Yes. See?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.480
Just one small adjustment.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.440
Nice.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.680
- It's good?
- Yeah.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.080
Thanks.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.000
Thanks, thanks.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.720
This collection
is my apogee.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.840
But I couldn't have done it

11:49.920 --> 11:51.760
without the aid and skill

11:51.840 --> 11:53.240
of one person.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.520
My new friend,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.640
and from now on,

11:58.720 --> 12:01.840
my new partner in all my designs...

12:02.880 --> 12:04.320
Madeleine.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.840
- Is it true?
- Yes.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.800
Welcome, Madeleine.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.760
Thanks.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.320
Thanks.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.680
Please.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.160
Now, where's the muppet?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.240
What?

12:32.320 --> 12:33.520
The muppet.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.560
The frog.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.760
It was there.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.520
Have you sold him?

12:38.600 --> 12:41.160
Mrs. Peters, hi.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.720
Can I help you?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.240
Where's the muppet?

12:44.320 --> 12:45.440
Um...

13:00.320 --> 13:02.400
Good afternoon, everybody.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.400
It's a great pleasure and privilege

13:04.480 --> 13:05.960
to introduce author

13:06.040 --> 13:08.920
and visiting principal clinical professor

13:09.000 --> 13:11.200
of veterinary neurology,

13:11.280 --> 13:13.280
Dr. Jefferson Wilson.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.880
Thank you.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.840
Well, I would like to thank
Dr. Chowdhury

13:21.920 --> 13:23.840
for that nice introduction. Thank you.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.080
So...

13:28.160 --> 13:32.480
of the roughly 5,000 species of mammals,

13:32.560 --> 13:34.720
only three to five percent

13:34.800 --> 13:37.200
are known to form lifelong pair bonds.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.960
Today, we're going to look at

13:41.040 --> 13:42.840
the neurobiological mechanisms

13:42.920 --> 13:46.440
regulating social and sexual affiliations

13:46.520 --> 13:48.080
in prairie voles.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.760
This is my fiancé, Pierre.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.040
Hello.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.280
Nice to meet you.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.560
Nice to meet you.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.840
I'm so lucky
to have her as a partner.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.840
Yes, so talented and beautiful...

14:10.920 --> 14:13.440
Unlike the more promiscuous
meadow vole,

14:14.160 --> 14:16.880
the male prairie vole
has a continuous contact

14:16.960 --> 14:18.480
with its female counterpart,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.000
which lasts for all of their lives.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.720
If the female prairie vole dies,

14:23.800 --> 14:26.360
the male does not look for a new partner.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.120
This uniqueness
in the prairie vole behaviour

14:31.200 --> 14:34.800
is related to the oxytocin
and vasopressin hormones.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.680
The oxytocin receptors
in the female prairie vole brain

14:38.760 --> 14:41.480
are located more densely
in the reward system,

14:41.560 --> 14:45.040
and has more receptors
than other species...

14:45.120 --> 14:46.760
But where is Coco?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.760
Coco couldn't make it.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.680
Oh.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.400
Shall we?

15:25.560 --> 15:26.800
Beautiful here.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.920
Recent studies in the US have found

16:22.000 --> 16:25.440
that if prairie voles are given
a solution of H2O and alcohol,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.440
this dopamine bond pattern

16:28.520 --> 16:31.040
is significantly affected...

16:32.920 --> 16:36.520
and the bonding patterns
of the prairie vole

16:36.600 --> 16:39.840
mimic that of the meadow vole...

16:40.720 --> 16:44.480
becoming quickly
and indiscriminately promiscuous.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.160
Where did you find it?

17:29.560 --> 17:30.960
It was under the cot.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.400
You think Jamie smashed
your grandfather's violin?

17:37.400 --> 17:38.760
I know he did.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.080
How does that make you feel?

17:43.800 --> 17:47.400
If you had one word right now
that came to mind,

17:47.480 --> 17:48.800
what would it be?

17:52.680 --> 17:53.880
One word?

17:57.880 --> 17:58.920
Hope.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.240
Look, I don't expect you to understand.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.280
Some people go through their whole lives

18:07.320 --> 18:09.640
without the first fucking clue
what love is...

18:11.000 --> 18:13.080
what a heart is,

18:13.200 --> 18:15.240
what it can do,

18:15.320 --> 18:17.480
what it must do.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.280
- Okay. Are we doing this?
- Yeah.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.520
Really? Okay. Okay.
Okay. All right.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.680
Okay, manifesto, all right.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.320
Number one.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.320
Love is impossible!

18:30.400 --> 18:33.080
- Number two!
- Number two...

18:33.160 --> 18:36.000
If love is impossible,
we must...

18:36.080 --> 18:38.480
- ...believe in the impossible.
- Believe in the impossible.

18:38.560 --> 18:43.280
We must believe in magic.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.880
Look, Amandine,

18:51.960 --> 18:53.680
we can go around and around,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.080
but the fact
is your husband caught you

18:56.200 --> 18:58.560
having sex with three other men.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.320
What makes you think I got caught?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.560
I can always find out...

20:01.640 --> 20:03.160
Happy birthday, Amandine!

20:03.240 --> 20:04.680
Here we go... Oh!

20:07.400 --> 20:09.320
- Amandine, budge up.
- All right.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.880
Here we go, here we go!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.000
Hey, Amandine, budge up,
budge up, budge up.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.800
Okay, ready?
Ready, ready, ready, ready.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.920
Okay, here we go, here we go,
here we go. Okay.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.800
Hi, I'm John.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.880
Hi, I'm George.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.640
Hi, I'm Ringo.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.720
- And I'm Paul.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.040
- ...Ringo.
- And I'm Paul.
