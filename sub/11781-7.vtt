WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.777
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.545
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.579 --> 00:12.546
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.116
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.118
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.151 --> 00:20.054
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.589
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.457
The way you look
sends a message.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.294
Let's just say the message it
sends is not a positive one.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.596
You know? Maybe if
I looked different,

00:28.629 --> 00:30.431
maybe people like
the Judge would treat me
a little differently.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.433
You're gonna tell me
why you ditched me
at the dance last week?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.335
I came back.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.405
Maybe I could
make it up to you
sometime.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.207
BuI'd like that.?

00:39.240 --> 00:39.707
Nick,
our table's ready.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.143
Who's your friend?

00:42.176 --> 00:43.477
How was your date?

00:43.511 --> 00:46.847
She did stay through
the whole thing,

00:46.880 --> 00:47.648
so that part was
an improvement.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.017
Ouch.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.553
Actually, I was thinking
about sleeping over
at a friend's tonight.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.222
Whose house are
you sleeping at?

00:54.255 --> 00:58.226
I'm sleeping
at the house
of Lulu.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.428
I'd be willing to
bet a year of my generous
Board of Education salary

01:00.461 --> 01:03.497
that Jane
isn't sleeping over
at Lulu Pope's.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.366
Where else would
she be sleeping?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.601
Did you ever stay out
all night when you were
in high school?

01:07.635 --> 01:11.272
I have to stop this.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.575
JANE: Fashion starts
oh-so-simply.
With an idea.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.112
There are fabrics and forms,

01:18.146 --> 01:18.712
patterns and prints,

01:18.746 --> 01:22.350
seams and silhouettes.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.319
But the most
important tool that
fashion possesses

01:27.688 --> 01:29.523
is the illusion.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.397
GRAY: We got her.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.267
Piper Grace is the new face
of our ad campaign.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.603
So, Birdie,
what's our
battle plan?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.273
The last time Piper
did a cover shoot,

01:45.306 --> 01:46.640
she showed up
with half her
head shaved.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.442
Runway show in Milan,

01:48.476 --> 01:50.911
no show.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.680
Swimsuit cover shoot
in Fiji,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.548
she went native.

01:54.582 --> 01:58.252
It took them three
weeks to find her.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.119
We cannot afford
any of these mishaps.

01:59.153 --> 02:03.224
We need someone
with her at all times.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.593
No more models for you.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.161
Mmm-mmm.
Don't look at me.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.229
When I worked
for Haute Couture,

02:08.262 --> 02:09.597
I had to watch her
for four days.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.764
And?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.334
Three of them were
spent in a holding
cell in Trenton.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.936
You.

02:15.969 --> 02:16.737
Moving. Out of town.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.510
I'm getting
my wisdom teeth
taken out. Ow.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.712
You people
are pathetic.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.145
What about you, Birdie?

02:27.315 --> 02:31.185
Family reunion.
I, uh, miss them.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.354
Someone's got
to watch her.
Who's it gonna be?

02:33.587 --> 02:36.524
Is it true?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.259
Piper Grace
is the new face
of Donovan Decker?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.227
I love her!

02:45.366 --> 02:46.300
What?

02:51.239 --> 02:54.742
* I've my heart where
my head should be

02:54.775 --> 02:57.478
* Light up the rest of me

02:57.511 --> 03:01.682
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

03:01.715 --> 03:03.717
* Through the stops,
the starts

03:03.751 --> 03:06.454
* And life is a work of art

03:09.523 --> 03:11.492
You want me to
take care of her?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.125
We do.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.296
You are our first choice.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.430
JANE: Because...

03:16.464 --> 03:18.499
Because you're
so responsible.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.334
Oh.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.236
Piper is the model
of the moment, Jane.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.504
This is a big
get for us.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.241
Nothing,
and I mean nothing,
can go wrong.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.509
Of course not.

03:28.542 --> 03:28.809
Wait, why would
something go wrong?

03:31.812 --> 03:35.249
Piper arrives tomorrow
from Milan.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.252
I'm on the first
flight to L.A.,

03:38.286 --> 03:40.588
but I'll be back in time
for the photo shoot.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.491
Until then,
she's all yours.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.427
And I am sure
that everything
will go smoothly.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.296
Of course.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.797
GRAY: Good luck, Jane.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.265
Should be fun.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.800
(SNICKERING) Fun.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.402
Right. Yeah.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.671
Yeah!
It'll be totally fun.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.041
But not too much fun.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.277
There are a few
key things you
have to remember

04:03.311 --> 04:04.712
whilst Piper is
in your care, Jane.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.078
You might want
to take notes.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.550
No tweeting.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.285
No trampolines.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.353
Trampolines?

04:12.386 --> 04:13.487
No faxing.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.688
No Fiji water.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.524
BIRDIE: Trust me.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.293
BOTH: Do not let her
out of your sight.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.694
(CHUCKLING)

04:20.728 --> 04:21.329
Seriously.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.316
Hey.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.851
Let me guess,
you're coming
back from the city?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.686
And you're headed in?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.588
Yeah. Bad timing.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.523
I know.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.724
You wanna grab
a cup of coffee?

04:50.758 --> 04:52.393
I could just
call my brother

04:52.426 --> 04:53.594
and tell him
I'll catch the next train.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.895
I'd like that.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.474
It's just...
I love it.

05:06.507 --> 05:10.611
Every single day
that I go there,
I feel alive.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.813
And as invisible
as I feel at school,

05:12.846 --> 05:16.550
there everyone sees me.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.654
I'm glad you found
something you love
this much.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.624
That's how you feel
about baseball, right?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.626
It's different.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.361
In my house, baseball,
it's pretty much a religion.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.663
I mean, we've had
season tickets
to the Yankees

05:29.697 --> 05:31.432
since before
I was born.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.735
(CHUCKLES)
Don't tell Ben that.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.605
You know, my seventh grade
picture, I think I'm actually
wearing a Yankees uniform.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.908
No, that was fifth grade.
I think.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.912
Um, so, does anyone else
in your family play?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.515
My dad,
he played for Penn.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.682
Got drafted
in the minors,

05:48.716 --> 05:49.717
never made it
to the Show.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.918
The Show?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.920
MajorOh.agues.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588
And is that
what you want?

05:54.622 --> 05:54.655
I think so.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.462
I mean,
that's the plan.
I just...

06:01.495 --> 06:03.931
I don't know
if I've chosen this
or if I was born into it.

06:03.964 --> 06:04.765
You know?

06:04.798 --> 06:08.135
Okay. Let's go there
for a minute.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.369
Okay.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.940
Uh, Dr. Nick Fadden.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.974
No? Okay.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.444
Senator Nick Fadden.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.380
Astrona(LAUGHS)Fadden!

06:23.651 --> 06:26.920
Or, starting pitcher
for the New York Yankees,
Nick Fadden.

06:26.954 --> 06:30.824
Ahh! Crowd goes wild.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.727
It's got
a nice ring to it.

06:33.761 --> 06:37.698
I think even if you'd
been kidnapped
by a family of senators,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.600
or astronauts,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.469
you'd still want to
be a baseball player.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.973
What?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.476
(CLEARS THROAT)
Nothing. It's just...

06:48.509 --> 06:51.979
I'm enjoying this.
Getting to know you better.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.748
Me, too.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.623
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

07:04.858 --> 07:06.960
It's my brother.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.997
And that's the last train.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.500
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

07:12.533 --> 07:12.900
We're gonna work
on this, okay?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.968
Our timing.

07:16.269 --> 07:26.514
Bye.

07:26.514 --> 07:31.519
Bye.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.653
You were supposed
to be home hours ago.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.922
God, Ben,
you scared me!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.023
You have to
stop doing that.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.026
I was just out with Nick.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.260
I thought you were
at your internship?

07:40.293 --> 07:43.497
I was, but then
I ran into him.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.932
Why didn't you call me?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.000
Sorry. I didn't
think I had to.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.504
Well, you do.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.974
And that's what
you said the last time
and the time before that.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.710
You know, Jane,
you've been doing
this a lot lately.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.812
You come and go
and stay out late

07:58.846 --> 08:01.281
and I never really know
who you're with
or where you are.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.283
Uh-huh. I will.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.818
What are you doing?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.954
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with you here.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.990
Why are you being
so serious about this?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.926
Because this is serious.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.061
Look, I've tried
the whole friendly,
big brother routine,

08:14.094 --> 08:16.830
and it's not working.

08:16.864 --> 08:17.731
You do whatever
you want without
even checking with me.

08:17.765 --> 08:21.068
And that's not
like you, Jane.
So...

08:21.101 --> 08:22.703
So I think something
has to change.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.906
I think there has
to be some sort of

08:28.041 --> 08:30.844
punishment for
what you're doing.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.747
(CHUCKLES)
A punishment?

08:33.781 --> 08:36.116
What, you're gonna like
ground me or something?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.619
Actually, yes.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.621
Yes, I am.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.091
You can't do that!

08:44.124 --> 08:46.860
Yeah. I think I can.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.963
I'm your legal guardian.
I'm responsible for you.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.632
Legally, I am.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.933
So I think I'm
going to have to...

08:52.966 --> 08:55.969
(STAMMERING) I'm going
to have to do that thing
that you said.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.706
You can't even say it.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.609
(SIGHS)

09:04.712 --> 09:06.046
You're grounded.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.583
Are you serious?

09:09.617 --> 09:10.150
I am.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.721
Ugh!

09:17.057 --> 09:18.158
Great, now I'm that guy.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.132
Wait, he did what?

09:25.165 --> 09:28.001
He grounded me.
Or at least he tried
to ground me.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.870
Wait. He tried
or he did?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.339
I did.
But I'm not sure
it's sticking.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.874
It's your job
to make it stick.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.876
She needs consequences.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.745
Look, you're doing
the right thing.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.113
I know,
but it just feels
sort of weird.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.015
Like I'Jerk!ng a...

09:42.049 --> 09:43.717
I mean, who does
he think he is?

09:43.751 --> 09:46.854
The boss. Because
I'm in charge, right?

09:46.887 --> 09:49.690
I wouldn't exactly
use the term "boss."

09:49.723 --> 09:50.490
You're more of
a parental figure.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.760
Right. Exactly.
Because I'm her...

09:52.793 --> 09:54.862
Legal guardian.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.964
He pulled
that card, huh?

09:56.997 --> 09:59.767
How exactly am I supposed
to watch the supermodel
when I'm grounded?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.268
He can't do this to me.

10:01.301 --> 10:05.806
That's why you need to
establish boundaries.
Teenagers need boundaries.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.140
I'm sure he's just trying
to do what he thinks
is best, Janey.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.843
I know. I know
he means well,
but I just...

10:12.680 --> 10:15.148
Right. Got it.
I'm leaving.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.384
All right.
See you later.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.251
Hi..

10:18.285 --> 10:20.120
I've been looking
for you all morning.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.656
YoYeah.e?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.992
So, my parents are
going out of town
this weekend.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.094
I'm gonna have
a few people over
after the game.

10:27.127 --> 10:31.064
Nothing big.
But I'd really like it
if you could be there.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.701
Of course.
I'd love to.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.702
Great. I'll see
you there, Jane.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.771
Yup. See you there.

10:37.805 --> 10:38.806
You're not going
to that party.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.140
God. Come on, Ben.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.210
Look, I get it. Okay?
You've made your point.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.912
And I will call
from now on.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.413
You need boundaries, Jane.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.215
Yeah. And consequences.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.750
Where are you
getting this from?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.218
Rita...
Miss SUm...aid...

10:51.251 --> 10:53.453
You were talking
to Miss Shaw about
my personal life?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.188
She is your
guidance counselor.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.224
If you say legal guardian
one more time...

10:57.257 --> 10:59.827
...legal guardian I have
every right to know that
your grades are slipping.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.762
It was one test.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.965
If I provide you
with boundaries
and consequences...

11:04.998 --> 11:06.834
...it helps to prevent

11:06.867 --> 11:10.237
alienation and confusion.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.705
(BELL RINGING)

11:11.739 --> 11:14.041
Okay. Now I'm confused.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.042
Seriously, Ben,
what is this about?

11:15.075 --> 11:18.045
I'm just trying to do
the best I can, Jane.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.146
By grounding me?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.850
Unfortunately, yes.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.986
Okay. So, just when
I start to get a life,
you're gonna ruin it?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.125
A little bit.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.834
Are you working
tomorrow?

11:40.868 --> 11:41.701
No. Why?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.804
Because Nick is
having a party and...

11:43.837 --> 11:46.206
I don't know.
Jane's grounded

11:46.239 --> 11:48.708
and it feels kinda
weird to go to
a party without her.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.080
So, lemme
get this straight.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.982
You'd rather not go
to a party with me,

11:55.015 --> 11:58.018
than go to one
without Jane?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.853
No, it's not like that.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.088
It's exactly like that.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.256
Come on, man.
You gotta go.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.892
It wouldn't be
the same without you.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.827
He's right.
You have to come.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.302
JANE: So, since
I'm under house
arrest this weekend

12:15.335 --> 12:17.938
and facing certain firing
from Gray, yet again,

12:17.971 --> 12:20.507
what do you say
you come over
on Friday night?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.042
We can do
a John Hughes marathon,
order some Thai?

12:22.075 --> 12:25.045
Fine. We can do horror.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
It's not the movie,
Janey. It's...

12:27.280 --> 12:29.149
(EXHALES) Okay,
don't kill me.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.551
I'm going to Nick's party.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.553
AreWith Lulu.us?

12:33.586 --> 12:34.687
Fantastic.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.157
Don't be mad at me.
All right?
Everyone's going.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.225
Everyone but me.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.799
This whole grounding thing
is unbelievably unfair!

12:45.833 --> 12:48.135
I'm as responsible
as Ben is. More.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.336
I have a job.
A real job!

12:49.369 --> 12:53.841
Yes, you do.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.342
Who's been a shut-in
basically her whole life,
living by the rules?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.245
You are. Were.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.547
And who is now
the executive assistant

13:00.580 --> 13:01.882
to the Creative Director
of Donovan Decker?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.550
That would be you.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.919
Clearly, my boss thinks
I'm responsible enough

13:05.953 --> 13:07.187
to put on a trunk show
in her house

13:07.220 --> 13:10.991
and then fly halfway
across the world
to deliver a lookbook.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.127
Okay, fine. I almost
didn't pull off either
one of those things,

13:14.161 --> 13:15.262
but, thanks to you,
I did.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.796
You're welcome.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.167
And now she has assigned me
a very important task
of watching the model.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.336
But how am I supposed
to watch Piper Grace,
and be grounded,

13:23.370 --> 13:26.106
and go to Nick's party
all at the same time?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.140
What do you think
I should do?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.279
I think...

13:32.312 --> 13:35.382
"All we have to decide
is what to do with the time
that is given to us."

13:37.350 --> 13:39.119
Strangely profound.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.054
Gandalf.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.056
Less profound.
Thanks, Billy.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.091
Anytime.

13:56.069 --> 13:56.169
So...

13:58.305 --> 14:00.607
"So..." What?

14:00.640 --> 14:01.374
Is she here?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.177
Piper?

14:05.112 --> 14:07.014
As a matter of fact...

14:09.382 --> 14:11.218
Wow.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.898
So, your fitting
for the shoot is
in about an hour

14:24.932 --> 14:27.667
and then we'll get you
straight over to your
hotel afterwards.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.937
In the meantime,
Gray's out of
the office today,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.005
so I thought maybe
you could just
hang out in here

14:32.039 --> 14:34.307
and watch some TV or...

14:34.341 --> 14:37.444
I don't know,
I could get you
a book or...

14:37.477 --> 14:39.646
Oh. I'm good.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.315
I have a magazine.
So, I'll just
hang out here.

14:42.349 --> 14:46.686
Cool. Well, if there's
anything you need,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.922
anything at all,
just ask me, and...

14:48.956 --> 14:50.257
My desk is just
right out there.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.060
Okay. Great.

14:55.095 --> 14:55.228
Okay.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.070
Hey.
How's she doing?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.171
Oh, she is doing just fine.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.140
Fine. Really?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.382
Hi, Jane.

15:15.415 --> 15:15.915
Hi.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.485
Uh, what's going on?

15:18.518 --> 15:19.486
Just getting in
a little workout?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.988
Uh-huh.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.991
Okay, well...

15:24.024 --> 15:25.392
MAN: T Ah! 's good.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.160
JANE: Um, how... What...

15:28.128 --> 15:29.196
Who is that?

15:29.229 --> 15:32.065
PIPER: It's Jumping Jack.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.234
I met him on
Chatter Addicts today.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.371
Okay, well,
we need to get
rid of him, okay?

15:38.405 --> 15:38.805
PIPER: Oh, you're right.
He's boring.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.074
JANE: Uh-huh.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.143
Sorry, Jumping Jack.
Boring.

15:43.176 --> 15:43.910
Next!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.412
No, no, no,
wait, wait...

15:48.015 --> 15:49.182
Hi!

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
Piper, look, I...

15:51.351 --> 15:53.453
Oh, my God!

15:53.486 --> 15:57.224
Dudes, get in here!
I got Piper Grace
on Chatter Addicts!

15:57.257 --> 15:57.524
We need to get rid
of this right now.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.526
No...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.228
Can you just...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.196
(STRUGGLING)

16:03.230 --> 16:07.400
Frankie! Scooter!
You guys gotta
get in here!

16:07.434 --> 16:10.270
Piper Grace is about to
make out with this chick
on Chatter Addicts!

16:10.303 --> 16:13.073
(GASPS) What?
Oh, (LAUGHING)...

16:13.106 --> 16:15.142
(EXCLAIMING)

16:17.477 --> 16:21.414
Piper, look, this is
a very important and
stressful week for me

16:21.448 --> 16:23.216
and if you could
just help me out,
I could...

16:25.452 --> 16:26.453
Piper?

16:29.456 --> 16:30.457
Oh, no.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.478
* I went past
your door last night

16:51.511 --> 16:53.246
* It made me wonder

16:54.247 --> 16:57.150
* What would it
feel like to be

16:57.184 --> 17:00.053
* Over and under...

17:02.822 --> 17:05.125
Oh, my God!
Rose Apodaca.

17:05.158 --> 17:05.792
I love your
fashion features.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.527
Thank you.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.628
I gotta...

17:10.163 --> 17:12.165
She lost Piper Grace,
didn't she?

17:14.234 --> 17:17.604
* I'm gonna get you

17:17.637 --> 17:19.506
* Yeah, I'm gonna get you

17:22.442 --> 17:24.077
Hello, Jane.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.212
Hi.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.379
How's it going?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.814
Good.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.317
Super. Piper is great.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.253
You've lost her,
haven't you?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.557
Lost her? What?

17:37.590 --> 17:41.628
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
No. "I lost her."
That's so crazy.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.098
I mean, if I had lost her,
where would she be?

17:45.132 --> 17:46.433
Other than in
Gray's office?

17:46.466 --> 17:50.503
Which is where she
is right now, reading
a magazine. Quietly.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.373
Good.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.108
Because we can't lose
track of her under
any circumstance.

17:55.142 --> 17:59.246
Totally. I am on the case.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.214
So, it's going
well in there?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.216
Yes, she is a breeze.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.651
AMmm-hmm.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.519
Really? Not giving
you any trouble?

18:06.553 --> 18:08.688
Not a bit.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.525
Take a look.
What do you think?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.129
That's...
That's amazing.

18:17.664 --> 18:21.301
And I'm gonna
get back to Piper,
right now.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.569
'Cause she's in there.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.305
Jane. Let me know
when you find her.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.174
Is it that obvious?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.410
Let's just hope she's
still in the building.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.279
Oh, my God,
I really hope so.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.350
Have you seen her?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.685
Nope.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.521
Bad, bad, bad,
bad, bad, bad.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.323
Well, that was fast.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.691
Hello, Carter.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.259
It's been a while.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.362
Yes. Yes, it has.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.531
You know,
what do you say,
we get out of here?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.666
Just for fun.
For old times' sake.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.701
I can't.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.337
Sure you can.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.206
Vegas, baby.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.441
Come on.
You know you want to.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.276
I don't.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.544
(STAMMERING)
I really, really don't.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.180
Oh, come on, Carter.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.617
Slot machines,
shiny lights,

19:10.650 --> 19:14.187
dancing boys.

19:14.221 --> 19:14.387
Carter!

19:15.722 --> 19:17.357
I'm so ashamed.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.627
JEREMY: It's time for
your fitting, Piper.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.629
Oh.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.201
41 hours and
36 minutes to go.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.669
This should be fun.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.341
Hey, I need your help.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.608
Shocker.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.478
Remember that
teen model I told you
I'm babysitting?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.414
She's totally
and completely
out of control.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.350
I have to get her from
the office to this hotel

19:43.383 --> 19:45.218
and somehow
keep her calm
until the photo shoot

19:45.252 --> 19:47.220
on Saturday
at Donovan Decker

19:47.254 --> 19:49.689
and I have absolutely
no idea how I'm gonna
do it all alone.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.257
Billy?

19:52.459 --> 19:52.859
Yes?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.395
Will you help?

19:55.428 --> 19:56.329
Dude, you had me
at teen model.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.986
Well, she's all yours now.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.389
Good luck, Jane.

20:32.299 --> 20:32.699
So, what now?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.801
Um...

20:34.834 --> 20:36.403
Well, you know,
I was thinking,

20:36.436 --> 20:38.271
we've had
a really big day,

20:38.305 --> 20:42.008
so maybe we could
just relax, rent a movie.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.610
You could order
room service.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.448
What about the mini bar?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.218
Where's the key?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.387
Oh... I don't know.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.791
Maybe it's...
We'll just look in here.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.430
She's outta control.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.664
I know, right?

21:04.697 --> 21:06.766
It's like she has
absolutely no...

21:06.799 --> 21:08.301
Boundaries?

21:11.504 --> 21:12.439
Wait. Do you hear that?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.642
I don't hear anything.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.709
Exactly.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.812
(GASPS) Piper!

21:19.846 --> 21:22.549
What? Billy said
I could order
room service.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.216
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

21:24.250 --> 21:26.586
Come on in, guys!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.455
AlParty!t!

21:29.856 --> 21:31.724
Who are
these people?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.493
Whoo-hoo!

21:33.526 --> 21:34.794
I met them in the hall.

21:34.827 --> 21:35.862
When?

21:35.895 --> 21:38.064
Just now.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.599
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

21:45.672 --> 21:46.473

Sorry. I'm really sorry.

22:14.667 --> 22:19.506
BEN: I'm...
I'm confused.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.107
Why would they have
a teenage girl look
after another teenage...

22:21.140 --> 22:22.609
(JANE SHUSHING)

22:25.445 --> 22:28.381
Because I am responsible.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.483
You're the only one
who seems to think
that I'm not.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.119
Yeah, about that.
You do recall that you are,
in fact, grounded?

22:33.152 --> 22:36.556
It was for my job.
I wasn't just gonna
say no and...

22:39.692 --> 22:42.729
Did your roommate
just ground you?

22:42.962 --> 22:45.398
(EXHALES)

22:45.432 --> 22:48.735
No. He's kidding.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.538
Totally kidding.
And, he's my brother.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.406
It's just, you know,
a little family joke!

22:53.440 --> 22:55.542
You're grounded!

22:55.575 --> 22:56.543
It's funny, right?

22:58.678 --> 23:00.680
Is that my shirt?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.148
Uh-huh.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.617
Wow. It looks so
different on you.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.661
How old is she again?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.429
Not old enough.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.898
I really love
your house.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.701
It's so homey
and dinky and cute.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.602
Like real life.

23:23.970 --> 23:24.637
Thanks, I think.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.741
Well, I'm off to bed.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.519
So can she stay or not?

23:39.552 --> 23:40.720
Yes. Absolutely.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.654
But you're
still grounded.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.624
You're in high school.
You're a teenager.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.460
I'm the adult here
whether you like it
or not.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.004
TOMMY: Morning, Bilbo.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.806
Bad news.
Republican Convention
was last week.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.875
You're up early.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.011
More like out late.
Just got in.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.913
Still living
the dream, huh?

24:06.946 --> 24:07.780
That's right.

24:11.518 --> 24:12.685
Seriously, though.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.020
What's all this about?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.489
Don't start
with me, Tommy.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.525
See ya.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.261
Hey, Billy.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.696
What do you say
you and me
hang out tonight?

24:23.730 --> 24:26.733
Just you and me?

24:26.766 --> 24:27.634
We can have some
good quality brother
time together.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.968
It'll be good.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.837
It's been a while.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.004
I'd like that.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.640
Yeah, me, too.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.709
Uh... But I've got plans.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.012
Maybe some other time?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.915
It's just, I'm going
to this party tonight.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.617
One of Lulu's friends.
It's nothing. It's...

24:44.651 --> 24:44.817
I'm in.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.089
It's not really
your kind of party,
Tommy.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.661
(CHUCKLES)

24:54.694 --> 25:00.933
* Sometimes we all
seem to make mistakes

25:00.967 --> 25:06.539
* I've made plenty
for you to erase

25:06.573 --> 25:12.545
* I've made plenty
for you to erase *

25:14.714 --> 25:15.782
Hi, Jane.

25:15.815 --> 25:15.848
Hi.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.552
Where's Ben?

25:19.586 --> 25:20.687
Who?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.855
Ben. My brother.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.958
Right. He went
to high school
where he works.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.294
Where you, apparently,
are a student.

25:28.327 --> 25:28.628
Found your ID.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.567
And then I found
your real ID.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.703
Oh, no.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.337
You know, you really
shouldn't leave your
purse out like that.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.739
You never know
what could happen.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.976
(LAUGHS)
It's funny, Jane.

25:44.010 --> 25:47.780
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.983
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna
tell on you.

25:51.017 --> 25:51.984
YouNo.n't?

25:52.018 --> 25:55.722
But on one condition.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.924
I want to go
to high school
with you today.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.727
What?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.997
No. Absolutely not.
I can't do that.
I would...

26:05.031 --> 26:08.735
Wait, why would you
want to go to school?

26:08.768 --> 26:12.004
Because, I've only
ever seen high school
on television, Jane.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.907
I haven't even
set foot in one.
Not once.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.943
I've been a model
since I was 13.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.746
And all I do is work
and travel and
work some more.

26:19.779 --> 26:25.151
And I've never had a chance
to just be normal.
A normal teen.

26:25.184 --> 26:29.922
And just this once,
I'd really like to see
what it was like.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.859
(DOOR OPENS)

26:32.892 --> 26:33.993
I am here.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.764
And I am ready to
babysit the model.

26:37.797 --> 26:38.798
Please?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.969
Change of plans.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.637
Yes, thank you.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.794
JANE: This is unbelievable.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.197
Yeah, high school
is way different than
I thought it would be.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.734
No, I mean, this.
Everyone's looking
at you.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.003
It's like you have
some sort of magical
superpower or something.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.440
Is this what it's
like all the time?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.944
(CHUCKLES)
Of course, silly.
I'm a model.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.947
But not today!
Today I'm just
like you.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.850
An ordinary, average,
nothing special,
high school girl.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.154
(GASPS) We should
totally tell people

27:35.187 --> 27:38.825
that I'm your cousin
from Poughkeepsie.

27:39.258 --> 27:39.525
Poughkeepsie?

27:39.558 --> 27:42.762
Yeah.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.731
Yeah. I don't know.
It could work.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.066
You guys definitely
have the same ear lobes.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.034
Thanks.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.705
All right. Well,
I'll let you two
cousins get to it.

27:52.739 --> 27:53.272
I've gotta
get to class.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.107
No, no, don't go, Billy.

27:55.141 --> 27:58.077
HaveThanks.iper!

27:58.110 --> 27:59.078
Hey, Jane,
how's it going?

27:59.111 --> 28:03.082
Uh, hey, Cam.
It's going fine.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.719
Since the last time
we talked, which was
in the sixth grade.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.255
Yeah, Jane and I
actually are
really close.

28:09.288 --> 28:12.091
So, who are you?

28:14.060 --> 28:15.061
I'm Jane's cousin, Piper.

28:17.096 --> 28:17.997
It's nice to meet you.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.836
Don't you just
love high school?

28:26.773 --> 28:27.840
Okay.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.010
You look so cute
today, Harper.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.812
Oh, thanks.
You, too.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.880
Thanks.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.047
Hi, girls.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.283
(BELL RINGING)

28:39.919 --> 28:42.188
Okay, so we've
just finished one
of the great classics

28:42.221 --> 28:45.491
of American literature,
The Great Gatsby.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.861
Now who can name
a classic work of
English literature?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.064
Uh, yes.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.299
Harry Potter.

28:53.332 --> 28:56.836
Harry...
Harry Potter?

28:56.869 --> 28:58.037
Yeah, you heard of it?

28:58.070 --> 29:00.940
Um, I have
heard of that.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.308
But I haven't
heard of you.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.110
I'm Piper.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.245
Piper, great.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.781
Well... Welcome.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.822
And that is why
I love Africa.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.323
(ALL LAUGH)

29:17.356 --> 29:20.092
They just wanted me
to keep an eye on her

29:20.126 --> 29:21.227
before the photo shoot
tomorrow.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.930
You know,
keep her
out of trouble.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.065
Which is actually
a lot harder
than it looks.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.235
It's amazing how much
they trust you at that
internship thing.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.803
Yeah, it's weird, huh?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.038
Hi!

29:32.071 --> 29:34.106
Hi, you must be Piper.

29:34.140 --> 29:34.773
The guy who likes Jane.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.309
I can tell.
It's a gift.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.046
I'm Nick.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.949
It's nice to
meet you, Nick.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.051
He totally looks like
one of those lovable
popular jock boys

29:45.084 --> 29:48.587
with a heart of gold
that you see
on those TV shows.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.156
Is that what you are?

29:50.189 --> 29:51.257
I guess.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.826
Sort of.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.830
See? It's creepy
how good I am at this.

29:57.864 --> 30:01.834
Okay, well, we're late
for my next class,
so I'll see you later.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.903
Yeah, I'll see you
tonight at my party.

30:03.936 --> 30:04.603
Party? What party?

30:04.636 --> 30:07.373
It's nothing.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.174
Nothing?
It's not nothing.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.043
It's my first
high school party!

30:11.077 --> 30:12.244
Oh, and your
boyfriend's so cute.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.214
Oh, he's not
my boyfriend.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.850
Okay, booty call
boy toy, lover.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.018
Ew.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.087
Oh, Jane.
You're so innocent.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.022
Like a pilgrim
or a singing nun.

30:23.055 --> 30:26.192
Okay. We can't
go to that party.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.293
Jane, we're going
to that party.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.328
If anything's more important
then you getting it on

30:29.361 --> 30:31.197
with hot jock with
a heart over there,

30:31.230 --> 30:33.332
it's me going to my
first high school party.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.634
Why not?

30:35.667 --> 30:39.238
Because I'm grounded.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.308
Okay? And I promised Ben
that I wouldn't go.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.878
Well, then you're just
gonna have to tell Ben
that it's a work obligation.

30:45.912 --> 30:49.916
Which it is.
Because if we don't
go to that party, Jane,

30:49.949 --> 30:54.286
everyone at Donovan Decker
will know that you
really are a teenager.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.988
Make it work, Jane.
Or else.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.158
This bitch
is killing me.

31:02.929 --> 31:03.395
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

31:16.342 --> 31:18.044
So, how'd you get Ben
to let you out of
the house for this?

31:18.077 --> 31:20.312
I didn't.

31:20.346 --> 31:21.680
Jane...

31:21.713 --> 31:23.950
What? He just
would've said no.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.651
And if I didn't
bring Piper here,

31:25.684 --> 31:27.186
she said she was gonna
tell everybody that
I was still in high...

31:27.219 --> 31:28.420
Hey.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.055
Can I grab you
for a sec?

31:29.088 --> 31:32.191
Uh, sure.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.192
Don't take your
eyes off of her.

31:33.225 --> 31:33.292
Not a problem.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.964
(CHEERING)

31:41.100 --> 31:41.800
Nice view.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.136
Tommy, what are
you doing here?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.138
I brought some
party favors.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.473
Your friends have
money to spend

31:47.506 --> 31:49.308
and I got a service
to provide.
It's a win-win.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.943
No, Tommy, no.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.212
Hey, who's that?

31:53.245 --> 31:56.282
That is my brother.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.150
He looks a lot like
you used to look.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.686
Yes. Yes, he does.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.354
It's like a before
and after picture.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.924
And you, the after,
are clearly much better.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.195
He's not gonna cause
any trouble, is he?

32:09.228 --> 32:10.262
(EXHALING)

32:10.296 --> 32:11.930
Let's hope not.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.969
And this is my desk.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.204
It's where I do all
my great thinking.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.338
Obviously.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.507
It's very tidy.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.409
I cleaned up
just for you.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.214
Wow, look at those.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.448
You wanna see the one
I'm most proud of?

32:29.481 --> 32:37.256
Mmm-hmm.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.391
Spelling Bee,
second grade.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.526
You won?

32:40.559 --> 32:41.994
Fourth place.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.295
Oh. And the word
that did you in?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.764
Satisfaction.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.099
(CHUCKLES)

32:53.572 --> 32:54.340

32:54.373 --> 32:57.443
BOY: Nick, do you
have a plunger?

32:58.144 --> 33:00.046
BOTH: Timing.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.751
You guys ready for this?

33:05.784 --> 33:07.553
What(SHUSHING)ng?

33:11.557 --> 33:12.724
You know,
if you were my girl,

33:12.758 --> 33:16.228
I wouldn't be
in there cheering
for some dumb model.

33:16.262 --> 33:19.031
Yeah, right. I can't
compete with that.

33:21.467 --> 33:25.003
Of course you can.
Look at you.

33:26.138 --> 33:26.472
You're gorgeous.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.111
And for the record,
I hate models.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.514
(LAUGHS)

33:35.547 --> 33:37.183
Oh!

33:37.216 --> 33:40.286
ALL: Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.021
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.593
Whoo!

33:47.626 --> 33:49.295
You were supposed
to be watching her.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.397
I got distracted.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.099
Tommy's here.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.366
Oh, boy.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.503
Hi! (LAUGHS)

33:57.536 --> 33:58.570
Okay, show's over, people!

34:03.509 --> 34:05.077
YUh-huh.?

34:05.111 --> 34:08.147
Whoa, this place
is a disaster.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.617
Yeah. It's pretty bad.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.420
Hey, maybe afterwards,
you could stay and help me
clean the place up?

34:14.453 --> 34:16.155
OThanks.e.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.359
(WHISPERING) You know
what that means, right?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.094
What what means?

34:23.329 --> 34:24.396
No.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.465
No. (GASPS) No!

34:28.600 --> 34:30.636
Yes. (LAUGHS)

34:30.669 --> 34:33.672
Let's, uh, let's
get you cleaned up.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.511
Harper, what the hell?

34:40.146 --> 34:42.348
Oh.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.150
No big deal, man,
we were just talking here.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.885
You know, really closely.
'Cause I'm a close talker.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.521
Yeah, we were
justRight?ng.

34:49.555 --> 34:50.556
Totally.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.859
Okay, I'm outta here.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.595
Yeah? Where do you
think you're going?

34:56.628 --> 34:58.530
I'm just leaving.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.367
You're not going anywhere.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.269
Not a good idea,
tough guy.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's all good.
I've got this, Cam.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.239
You've got this?
How'd this dirtbag get
in the party anyhow?

35:07.273 --> 35:08.907
You're right, bro.
It's my fault.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.341
Look, he doesn't want
any trouble, okay?
He's just...

35:09.375 --> 35:12.378
He's just trash.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.213
All right?
You can dress up
all you want,

35:14.246 --> 35:15.714
but you're still
trash, too.
The both of you.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.592
Is that right?

35:29.361 --> 35:30.596
Just get out.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.468
Good choice.

35:37.469 --> 35:37.669
Come on, Lu.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.510
Right.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.721
I can't find her.
Piper is officially
missing.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.189
I've called,
texted, tweeted.

35:57.223 --> 36:01.193
I even looked on
Chatter Addicts.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.595
So much for
being responsible.

36:03.629 --> 36:07.233
You did the best
you could, short of
handcuffing her, right?

36:11.570 --> 36:16.208
So when you said
"cleaning up."

36:16.242 --> 36:17.042
What?

36:17.075 --> 36:20.246
You just meant
cleaning up, right?

36:20.979 --> 36:23.515
Yeah, what did you
think I meant?

36:23.549 --> 36:26.218
* Stuck in this place
and you don't wanna be here

36:26.252 --> 36:29.488
* I know

36:29.521 --> 36:32.491
* Voices call you
in the night

36:32.524 --> 36:33.359
* Come away...

36:33.392 --> 36:35.794
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

36:37.496 --> 36:39.231
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:41.567 --> 36:43.269
(BANGING ON DOOR)

36:45.604 --> 36:48.574
Don't move.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.410
* I just need a light
at the end of the tunnel

36:51.443 --> 36:53.512
* A little light
to illuminate

36:53.545 --> 36:55.314
* The truth in the stillness

36:55.347 --> 36:58.250
* After everything
is blown away

36:58.284 --> 37:00.619
* Life fades in the cuts
and the struggles *

37:00.652 --> 37:02.421
You're coming with me.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.455
Now.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.524
(SIGHS)

37:10.296 --> 37:12.431
BEN: Jane, we've gotta
talk about this.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.566
Oh, you want to talk?
Let's talk.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.769
Why would you do that?

37:17.803 --> 37:21.740
Showing up like that?
It was so embarrassing.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.310
You had no right.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.545
You think
I want this?

37:26.578 --> 37:29.281
You think I didn't
want to be the cool,
older brother

37:29.315 --> 37:31.417
that you visited
in college?

37:31.450 --> 37:33.319
The guy you confide in?

37:33.352 --> 37:35.053
The guy you have
your first beer with?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.356
I would so much
rather be that guy.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.758
But I have to be
this guy, Jane.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.394
It's my job
to keep you safe.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.296
Whether you
like it or not.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.532
I'm sorry.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.335
It's okay.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.343
(EXHALES)
Oh, my God!

37:57.376 --> 38:00.346
Honestly? After taking
care of Piper Grace for
the past couple of days,

38:00.379 --> 38:03.749
I actually
kind of get it.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.084
But I am not
like her, Ben.
I promise.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.454
I am not like Piper.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.855
I know.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.358
Her legs are way
longer than yours.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.460
You...
Shut up!

38:15.427 --> 38:16.428
(EXCLAIMS)

38:22.434 --> 38:24.403
Billy?

38:24.870 --> 38:26.304
Yup.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.484
Are you okay?

38:38.517 --> 38:41.353
Couldn't sleep.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.855
I heard what
happened last night.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.425
You should've found me.
I would've left with you.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.627
I know you would have.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.661
I didn't want to
ruin your night.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.737
I don't know who I am
anymore, Janey.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.375
Well, I do.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.378
You're not your
brother, Billy.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.747
And you're not Cam
and those guys, either.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.419
You're you.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.722
And that's perfect.

39:20.559 --> 39:25.163
So what do you say,
John Hughes
and Thai tonight?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.698
(LAUGHS) I'm in.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.769
Ugh! But I have to
go into the office

39:30.802 --> 39:32.704
and tell Gray
that I lost Piper.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.642
The photo shoot is in...

39:36.675 --> 39:40.546
Four hours
and I don't
have a model.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.448
Gray is gonna kill me.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.151
What?

39:46.184 --> 39:49.455
I might be able to
help you out with that.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.658
Do I get to keep this?

39:53.725 --> 39:54.760
You're funny.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.796
Seriously, I could
use a new robe.

39:58.797 --> 39:59.831
(LAUGHS)

40:04.803 --> 40:07.739
* I've fallen in love
with the winter

40:10.576 --> 40:13.712
* It's so wonderful
because she keeps me warm *

40:15.981 --> 40:18.684
PHOTOGRAPHER: Great.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.453
GRAY: Piper looks
amazing and you
got her here on time.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.522
And she's not
tanned or tattooed.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.824
She's even behaving.
How'd you pull that off?

40:25.857 --> 40:27.493
I have no idea.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.562
MAN: That's a wrap!

40:33.599 --> 40:34.833
Jane, come here.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.235
Thank you.
You look beautiful.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.470
Oh!

40:38.770 --> 40:42.908
No, Jane, thank you.

40:42.941 --> 40:46.478
The last couple of days
have been really normal.

40:46.512 --> 40:49.481
Which is not really
normal for me.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.583
You have no idea
what it's like

40:51.617 --> 40:54.786
to have to pretend
to be so grown up
all the time and...

40:57.055 --> 40:58.690
I guess you do.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.661
Don't grow up
too fast, Jane.

41:02.694 --> 41:03.729
Piper.
You need to change.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.732
The car's waiting
to take you
to the airport.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.033
Okay. Bye.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.535
Bye.

41:12.904 --> 41:17.543
That was a success.
Thanks to you.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.046
Gray and I are
going to a bistro
to celebrate.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.815
We'd love it
if you could join us.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.817
Actually, I think
I'm gonna
head home early.

41:27.553 --> 41:28.787
Maybe another time?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.756
Of course.
Great job.

41:30.789 --> 41:30.822
Bye.

41:44.570 --> 41:44.836
(WHISTLES)

41:48.106 --> 41:49.808
(CHUCKLES)
You're back.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.510
Better than ever.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.546
(GROANS)

41:55.714 --> 41:57.816
It's about time.
