00:04.395 --> 00:07.311
<i>Dr. Ben Song risked
everything when he used</i>

00:07.311 --> 00:10.619
<i>the Quantum Leap Accelerator
to travel back in time.</i>

00:10.619 --> 00:13.491
<i>Now our team's working
to find out why.</i>

00:13.491 --> 00:17.147
<i>As he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is,</i>

00:17.147 --> 00:19.236
<i>he still has one hope--</i>

00:19.236 --> 00:23.545
<i>that his next leap
takes him back</i>

00:23.545 --> 00:29.029
<i>to the place and people
he calls home.</i>

00:33.468 --> 00:35.339
Right this way, Doc. Hurry.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.776
Oh, where the hell
is Dr. Goldman?

00:37.776 --> 00:40.866
I-I'm calling him right now.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.216
Oh, God.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.782
This baby is not due
for another month.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.175
Why is this happening?

00:45.175 --> 00:46.655
That's an excellent question,

00:46.655 --> 00:48.961
which I'm sure Dr. Goldman
can answer.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.180
I just got her
answering service.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.442
They don't know where she is.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.791
Who's going
to deliver our baby?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.576
She is, Right, Doc?

00:54.576 --> 00:55.751
Great.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.057
Me?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.362
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.798
We're going to take
this woman to the place

00:59.798 --> 01:01.278
where the people who
actually deliver babies work.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.366
No time.
That baby is crowning.

01:02.366 --> 01:03.628
It's coming right now.

01:03.628 --> 01:04.803
- I can't do this.
- You can. You can.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.762
- I can't.
- Come on.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.765
Guess I'm doing this.

01:10.635 --> 01:14.074
OK, when you're ready,
as hard as you can, push.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.205
You got this, mama.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.685
You got it.

01:16.685 --> 01:17.773
Come on, baby.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.906
- OK.
- Yes, you got this.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.082
OK, I can see its head.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.170
You're almost there.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.128
Just one more big push.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.564
Come on, mama.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.609
You got it.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.492
Oh.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.192
Congratulations.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.671
It's a girl.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.719
I can take from here, Doc.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.766
Let's get you guys to a room,
OK?

02:06.648 --> 02:09.738
Paging, Dr. Song,
Dr. Ben Song.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.827
Addison, you'll never
guess what I just did.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.437
I delivered a baby.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.788
Like an actual,
real-life human child.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.050
Wow.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.748
Look at you, bringing
life into the world.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.184
It was like a miracle.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.273
But also something I never
want to have to do again.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.101
That is fair.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.798
Hey, looks like
you won't have to.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.887
All right, so this time,
it looks like you

02:28.887 --> 02:31.629
are Dr. Alexandra Tomkinson,

02:31.629 --> 02:34.980
a first-year resident
at Cedarhurst Hospital,

02:34.980 --> 02:37.069
Seattle, 1994.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.158
Oof.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.768
Height of the grunge era.

02:39.768 --> 02:43.902
And, oh, a start of a very
promising medical career.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.428
What you doing?
- The bras.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.820
I'm still not used to them.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.213
Underwire.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.998
Honestly, Steven, you're
holding that against me?

02:52.998 --> 02:55.523
At least I spend my days
trying to save lives.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.264
Of course, I want what's
best for Max.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.439
He's my son.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.049
Is that someone
I should know?

03:00.049 --> 03:01.964
Dr. Sandra Turk.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.835
third year resident,
kind of a mentor for you.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.315
Looks like she's going
through a rough divorce

03:05.315 --> 03:07.099
and a brutal custody battle.

03:07.099 --> 03:08.362
Sure sounds like it.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.754
Your shift ended
an hour ago, Alex.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.234
The hell are you
still doing here?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.758
I got roped into
delivering a baby.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.761
Volunteered is more
like it, knowing you.

03:16.761 --> 03:17.893
Go home.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.416
Get some rest.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.288
You can't save everyone.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.944
There must be someone
at this hospital

03:25.944 --> 03:27.337
whose life I have to save.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.601
Close.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.343
It looks like you're here
to save three people's lives.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.742
Hi, nurse.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.048
Nurse Carolina.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.964
Hey, girl, I was hoping
you could help me.

03:45.964 --> 03:49.359
I am looking for three
specific patients.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.708
These patients got names?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.014
Yes.

03:52.014 --> 03:57.193
Kimberly Cole, Eli Jackson,
and Louis Tann.

03:57.193 --> 03:58.847
They should be in the system.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.548
Nope.
I don't see any of them.

04:05.854 --> 04:06.942
That's weird.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.075
Why would I be here
at a hospital

04:10.075 --> 04:12.426
where the people I'm supposed
to see aren't here?

04:14.341 --> 04:15.690
- They're supposed to be here.
- OK.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.734
But when?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.127
Code trauma.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.781
<i>Repeat, code trauma.</i>

04:19.781 --> 04:20.999
<i>Code trauma.</i>

04:20.999 --> 04:23.219
<i>Repeat, code trauma.</i>

04:23.219 --> 04:25.047
Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.319
- What's going on?
- Train crash.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.147
Multiple victims coming in hot.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.151
Should have left when
you had the chance, Alex.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.196
It's about to get real messy.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.287
All right, people, showtime.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.294
Critical patients
are top priority.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.078
If they can walk,
they can wait.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.603
Someone get me an
intubation tray now.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.605
I need bandages over here.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.564
There's a lot of blood.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.661
Code trauma.

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
Hey. Don't just stand there, resident.

05:14.966 --> 05:15.924
Help someone.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.708
That's what I'm trying to do.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.623
Hey, Madison, what if
the reason those patients

05:19.623 --> 05:20.929
weren't in
the hospital database

05:20.929 --> 05:22.800
was because they hadn't
been admitted yet?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.888
Yes.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.150
OK, Ziggy says there
is a 100% chance

05:25.150 --> 05:26.326
all three were on that train.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.457
Now all I have
to do is find them.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.632
Yeah, and quickly.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.807
In the original timeline,
Kimberly Cole,

05:29.807 --> 05:31.679
Louis Tann,
and Eli Jackson

05:31.679 --> 05:33.158
don't survive the accident.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.464
Dr. Turk, over here.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.552
What do we got?

05:35.552 --> 05:36.988
Female, 17 years old.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.034
Took a piece of
shrapnel to her heart.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.296
She's not breathing.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.471
Alex, get the bag.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.299
She means
the resuscitation bag.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.345
Oh. Right, the bag.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.781
All right,
cover her nose and mouth,

05:46.781 --> 05:48.826
and then squeeze the bag
just slow and steady

05:48.826 --> 05:50.611
until you see her chest
start to rise and fall.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.048
And then just keep
repeating that.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.179
It's working.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.224
Don't get too excited.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.356
She's not out of the woods yet.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.661
Any idea who she is?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.446
I found this in her pocket.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.187
Kimberly Cole.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.754
Wait.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.366
Isn't this one of the patients
you were asking about?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.671
Get her to the OR stat.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.020
And tell Dr. Rojas
to administer

06:09.020 --> 06:11.153
10ccs of Respiratrex.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.329
Is there a problem, Dr. Turk?

06:13.329 --> 06:15.375
No, Dr. Harper.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.028
No problem at all.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.205
All right, you heard him.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.207
Let's get her to the OR, stat.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.907
What's Respiratrex?

06:25.907 --> 06:28.213
Surgical anesthetic.
Why?

06:28.213 --> 06:29.563
Dr. Turk did not seem happy

06:29.563 --> 06:31.303
when Dr. Harper prescribed it
for surgery,

06:31.303 --> 06:33.001
like she thought
it was a bad idea.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.046
Well, pharmaceutical
companies in the '90s would

06:35.046 --> 06:37.875
often sell experimental drugs
to hospitals that seemed

06:37.875 --> 06:39.877
promising at the time,
but turned out to have

06:39.877 --> 06:43.054
negative side effects on people
with pre-existing conditions.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.143
Well, if Respiratrex
was one of those,

06:45.143 --> 06:48.886
why would Dr. Harper
insist on using it?

06:48.886 --> 06:50.888
Because Cedarhurst
was one of the five hospitals

06:50.888 --> 06:53.500
incentivized to use it
during the final trials.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.589
So they're putting profits
before patients?

06:55.589 --> 06:58.461
Well, OK,
if Respiratrex was dangerous,

06:58.461 --> 07:00.594
they didn't know that then.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.726
What are her odds?

07:02.726 --> 07:04.467
50/50, at this point.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.904
I'd be a lot more confident
if Dr. Harper had prescribed

07:06.904 --> 07:10.560
a more proven anesthetic,
like Soprofon or Restanol

07:10.560 --> 07:13.476
or anything other
than Respiratrex.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.435
Can I see her chart?

07:19.177 --> 07:21.223
Girl.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.617
If Dr. Harper finds out
you changed his script,

07:23.617 --> 07:25.488
he will nuke your career.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.190
OK, well, Ziggy says
there's an 85% chance

07:32.190 --> 07:35.411
that Dr. Tomkinson loses
her job if you get caught.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.021
Well, then let's hope
I can save

07:37.021 --> 07:39.502
these people's lives without
ruining Alex's in the process.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.551
Bold.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.601
You know, you're taking
an awful big risk

07:51.601 --> 07:53.560
bringing me in here.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.127
I've committed every square
inch of this place to memory.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.260
Think of what I could do
if I got loose.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.437
It is a risk, but I believe
it's one worth taking.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.961
Do tell.

08:03.961 --> 08:07.312
We want the same thing,
to help Ben save Addison

08:07.312 --> 08:08.792
and bring him home.,

08:08.792 --> 08:10.968
just like your dad wanted
to do for Sam Beckett.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.797
So let's stop working
at cross purposes

08:13.797 --> 08:15.625
and start working together.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.671
What do you know
about Ben's leap?

08:17.671 --> 08:19.586
Trust is a two-way street, partner.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.811
OK, I will tell you
what I know,

08:27.811 --> 08:29.509
but only after I talk to Ben.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.516
Hey, you.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.562
How the hell did you
know Kimberley Cole

08:39.562 --> 08:41.433
was going to be in that crash?

08:41.433 --> 08:45.176
Would you believe I
can predict the future?

08:45.176 --> 08:49.354
And it looks like you're
two for two, Nostradamus.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.661
Now go see if you can predict
how to help this guy.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.885
A brain tumor?

08:59.321 --> 09:01.149
Doc, are you sure?

09:01.149 --> 09:03.978
I'm afraid so.

09:03.978 --> 09:07.155
But the EMT said the worst
thing this could possibly be

09:07.155 --> 09:09.679
is a concussion.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.289
Look, I just hit my head.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.553
And in a way,
it's a good thing that you did.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.555
I just have to send you
over to oncology right away.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.817
What for?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.470
Chemo, radiation.

09:18.470 --> 09:21.256
Whatever treatment the
doctors think would be best.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.867
Aren't you the doctor?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.130
Only temporarily, I hope.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.131
OK.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.699
Then I want you
to discharge me.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.616
Mr. Jackson,
you have a serious,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.400
life-threatening condition.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.750
Yeah.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.317
It's not much of a life
worth living for.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.233
Look, I'm so done fighting.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.802
I've been done ever since
my Sarah passed.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.849
These last five years
without her,

09:48.849 --> 09:51.286
they've been so damn lonely.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.986
I can imagine.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.162
But there must be other
people in your life.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.295
Any family? Kids?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.300
Eli?

10:07.084 --> 10:09.913
You were on the train, too.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.480
What are the odds of that?

10:11.480 --> 10:12.655
You know him?

10:12.655 --> 10:14.439
Of course she does.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.224
She's my daughter.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.317
Wow.
Pagers.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.448
Talk about a throwback.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.929
Another crash victim
just came in.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.627
I'll see you around, Eli.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.368
Actually, Sandra, you--

10:30.368 --> 10:32.675
Don't. Don't. Don't.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.939
Don't tell her about
the tumor, please.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.898
I don't want her to know.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.987
Fine, but you have to
stay here until I get back.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.336
Deal?

10:41.336 --> 10:42.685
Deal.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
Hey.
Any updates on Kimberly Cole?

10:49.039 --> 10:51.389
Ziggy's still working on it.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.348
You found Eli Jackson.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.481
How'd that go?
- Not great.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.919
Turns out he's Sandra's dad,
and he has cancer

10:58.919 --> 11:00.834
but refuses
to do anything about it.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.662
OK, well,
in the original history,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.402
his refusal to seek
treatment allowed

11:04.402 --> 11:07.101
the tumor to metastasize.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.364
You have to change
his mind or else--

11:09.364 --> 11:10.452
He's a dead man.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.888
I get it.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.978
Yeah.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.240
How many fingers
am I holding up?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.851
- Three.
- Great.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.114
Now, can you please tell me
if anyone has seen my wife?

11:20.114 --> 11:21.376
We were on the train together.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.160
I just want to know
where she is.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
We're going to help
you find her, sir.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.773
But first, I need to know,
what's your name?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.339
Louis Tann.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.733
Ben, that's the third name
on the list.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.430
Yeah, and it doesn't seem
like his

11:32.430 --> 11:33.954
is a case of life or death.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.869
If you're done talking
to yourself, Dr. Tomkinson,

11:35.869 --> 11:37.348
I could use your help
over here.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.263
Yes, Dr. Turk.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.269
Oh, no.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.062
All the ORs are taken,
so I'm going to have

11:55.062 --> 11:56.628
to remove that shrapnel here.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.761
It's dangerously close to
a superficial temporal artery.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.502
One slip and he'll bleed out.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.547
And in the original history,
Sandra nicked the artery

12:02.547 --> 12:04.854
and Louis died on the spot.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.944
OK, so what can I do to
make sure that doesn't happen?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.250
Talk to him.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.904
Keep him calm and distracted.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
Finally, something
you're qualified for.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.040
Hi.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.042
Mr. Tann, I'm Dr. Tomkinson.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.652
I understand you're
looking for your wife.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.002
Her name's Jeane.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.830
We were in the third car
near the back

12:23.830 --> 12:26.136
when the train ran off
the rails,

12:26.136 --> 12:28.617
and we got separated.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.967
I'm sure the first responders
are out there looking

12:30.967 --> 12:32.708
for her right now,
but in the meantime,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.231
I just need you to stay calm.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.667
How?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.321
I don't even know
if she's alive or dead.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.280
Look, it's not bad news
until it is.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.804
So let's just focus
on the good.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.807
Can you do that for me,
Mr. Tann?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.026
Yeah, I guess.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.552
So how about you tell me
a little something

12:50.552 --> 12:51.945
about you two?

12:51.945 --> 12:53.903
Like, where did you meet?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.647
In college.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
It was the last summer
before our senior year.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.086
I was working at one
of the neighborhood bars.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.435
She was a waitress.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.220
Turns out, we were
both science majors.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.136
Boy, did we have chemistry.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.140
Yeah, my fiancée
and I met at work too.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.493
How long have you been married?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.103
25 years.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.975
Still going strong.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.065
I'd be lost without her.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.457
Yeah.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.937
I know the feeling.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.809
All right, Mr. Tann,
we're almost there.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.462
So what I want
you to do is focus

13:31.462 --> 13:33.813
on all those amazing
memories of Jeane

13:33.813 --> 13:35.336
so we can get you healed up
and--

13:35.336 --> 13:36.772
- Got it.
- Ah.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.863
Get him stitched up.

13:40.863 --> 13:41.908
Nice work.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.910
We'll do our best
to find her.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.435
Thank you, Doctor.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.570
Nice job, Ben.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.224
You just helped
save a man's life.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.922
Yeah.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.228
Just two more to go,
one of whom

13:58.228 --> 14:02.058
still needs to be convinced
they've got a reason to live.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.364
Well, lucky for us,

14:03.364 --> 14:05.627
that reason works
at this hospital.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.985
Nice.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.334
I see what you're doing.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.859
Magic's good cop,
your drunk cop.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.036
Going to ply me with booze
to loosen my tongue.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.951
Actually,
this is a peace offering.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.039
Oh.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.736
For how things
went down in Belize.

14:27.736 --> 14:30.521
Yeah.
It was a clever sting.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.654
Kind of trap I would've sprung.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.396
To great minds then.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.925
I don't blame you for not
wanting to talk to any of us.

14:42.925 --> 14:46.494
If I was in your position,
being held against my will,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.452
I certainly wouldn't.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.541
See?

14:50.541 --> 14:52.065
You get me.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.242
The only thing is,
I'm not in your position

14:55.242 --> 14:58.201
because I know something
I'm guessing you don't.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.291
Does the name Richard Martínez
ring any bells?

15:01.291 --> 15:04.164
Pretty generic. Why?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.731
Because he called Ben by name
during Ben's fifth leap.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.298
You made a
serious miscalculation

15:08.298 --> 15:09.821
coming here, Ben.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.519
If you value your life,
you need to stop following me.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.999
And how did Ben react
to that?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.043
He was stunned.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.958
He had no idea
what was going on.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.221
But I get the feeling you do.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.962
You really need
to let me talk to him.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.529
Yeah, you said that already.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.880
Look, if this Martínez guy
recognized Ben, that means--

15:24.880 --> 15:27.100
look there is an order
that has to--

15:28.710 --> 15:30.320
Wait. What order?

15:30.320 --> 15:31.669
What do you mean?

15:36.326 --> 15:38.981
You won't tell me because
you don't trust anyone here.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.114
Actually, there's
one person besides Ben

15:41.114 --> 15:42.550
that I will talk to.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.772
<i>40 miles south of Seattle,
train 501 has derailed</i>

15:47.772 --> 15:49.035
<i>in Washington state.</i>

15:49.035 --> 15:51.037
<i>You see that car right there,</i>

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
<i>it is right on [indistinct].</i>

16:00.568 --> 16:02.091
Ahh, what I wouldn't give

16:02.091 --> 16:04.920
for high-speed internet access
right now.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.010
Ah.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.533
Got a patient
with a brain tumor?

16:09.533 --> 16:12.101
Uh, yeah. Any advice?

16:12.101 --> 16:13.276
Send them to oncology.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.017
What if they won't go?

16:15.017 --> 16:17.411
Then you find a way
to make them go.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.934
You're the doctor, Alex.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.805
Their life is in your hands.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.633
Oh, I know.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.766
Believe me.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.550
Hey, so it must have
been a surprise,

16:26.550 --> 16:28.596
huh, seeing your dad here?

16:28.596 --> 16:31.425
We're not exactly
on the best terms.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.167
Is this a recent thing or--

16:34.167 --> 16:35.951
When I was a kid,
my father was

16:35.951 --> 16:38.040
this big-time corporate lawyer.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.694
Defending all these
evil corporations

16:39.694 --> 16:40.956
against chemical spills,

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
sexual harassment suits,
you name it.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.483
The more egregious the crime,
the harder he fought for them.

16:46.483 --> 16:50.270
So hard, in fact, that he
never had time for his family.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.750
I'm sorry to hear.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.448
Don't be.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.190
His bad example is what
drove me to become a doctor,

16:57.190 --> 16:59.235
so I could prevent
people suffering

16:59.235 --> 17:02.238
and be the complete opposite
of him.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.764
Do you think you two
could ever reconcile, or--

17:08.288 --> 17:09.854
Not in this life.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.686
Crap. Harper wants to see us.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.819
Damn right, he does.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.995
It's come to my attention
that somewhere between

17:19.995 --> 17:23.085
the ER and OR, someone altered
Kimberly Cole's chart,

17:23.085 --> 17:26.088
prescribing Restanol
instead of Respiratrex,

17:26.088 --> 17:29.004
despite my explicit instructions.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.615
It was me. I did it.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.356
Why am I not surprised?

17:33.356 --> 17:35.228
Dr. Harper, sir, it may
not be public information,

17:35.228 --> 17:37.099
but there has been studies
that say Respiratrex has

17:37.099 --> 17:38.666
had terrible side
effects on patients

17:38.666 --> 17:39.884
with preexisting conditions.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.843
I'm aware of the studies.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.106
But this drug is about
to be FDA approved,

17:44.106 --> 17:46.239
or else the board wouldn't
have authorize it's use.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.110
Furthermore,
Kimberly Cole doesn't

17:48.110 --> 17:50.721
have a pre-existing condition.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.550
Ziggy says she has an
undiagnosed case

17:53.550 --> 17:55.291
of Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.771
Her interaction with the drug
triggers it

17:56.771 --> 17:58.120
and ultimately causes
her death.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.991
She has Duchenne's
Muscular Dystrophy.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.384
Not according to that chart.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.865
It's... undiagnosed.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.475
Are you a doctor
or a psychic?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.347
All I'm asking is that you
use an alternative anesthetic.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.218
It could mean the difference
between life and death.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.828
Do you agree
with Chicken Little here,

18:10.828 --> 18:12.308
that the sky's about to fall

18:12.308 --> 18:15.746
if we don't stop using
Respiratrex?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.226
I--

18:19.620 --> 18:21.448
We're in crisis mode here.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.451
We will continue using
Respiratrex as prescribed.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.540
But when this is over, missy,

18:26.540 --> 18:28.237
you and I are going
to have a come-to-Jesus

18:28.237 --> 18:30.805
about your future here
at Cedarhurst.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.896
Oh, he did not
just call you missy.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.332
You heard that too?

18:36.332 --> 18:39.379
Can you believe that
condescending tool?

18:40.467 --> 18:41.859
He's got some nerve
talking to you

18:41.859 --> 18:43.296
like you're not even a doctor.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.036
What I can't believe is
that you didn't push back.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.864
You know how dangerous
that drug is.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.344
It wouldn't have mattered.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.085
The pharmaceutical companies
have got the board

18:50.085 --> 18:51.739
deep in their pocket,

18:51.739 --> 18:54.045
and Harper is
the board's lackey.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.178
Nothing you or I could say
is going to change things.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.745
But a girl's life
is at stake.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.443
How can you be so sure?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.880
Call it a hunch.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.231
You want me to risk
imploding my career

19:05.231 --> 19:06.884
in the middle
of a custody battle

19:06.884 --> 19:09.539
I can barely afford to fight
on a hunch?

19:09.539 --> 19:11.715
My son is my whole world.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.196
If I lose him,
I lose everything.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.199
I'm sorry, Alex, it's just--

19:17.199 --> 19:19.419
it's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

19:23.510 --> 19:26.252
It's my damn ex.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.775
Hello?

19:30.038 --> 19:31.996
Oh, Ben, we have a problem.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.868
Let me guess.
I just got myself fired.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.261
No, worse.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.219
Ziggy says hundreds
of people die

19:37.219 --> 19:39.656
from Respiratrex
in the next few years.

19:39.656 --> 19:40.788
You have to get the doctors

19:40.788 --> 19:42.224
to stop using it.
- How?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.443
The drug companies
bought off the board.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.009
The attending physician's
a sexist jerk

19:45.009 --> 19:46.533
who won't listen to me.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.404
And the one doctor who might
be able to change his mind

19:48.404 --> 19:50.014
won't even try because
she's afraid of losing

19:50.014 --> 19:52.278
the only family she has left.

19:53.583 --> 19:58.240
Except it's not
the only family she has left.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.199
Wait.
Ben, where are you going?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.810
To see a lawyer
about a doctor.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.248
What?

20:12.820 --> 20:14.778
Mr. Jackson,
what are you doing?

20:14.778 --> 20:16.606
What does it look
like I'm doing?

20:16.606 --> 20:19.696
Like you're about
to make a fatal mistake.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.611
If you leave now, your chances
of surviving this cancer

20:21.611 --> 20:22.917
dropped precipitously.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.788
Doc, I've made peace
with all that.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.791
I don't know how much
Sandra's told you,

20:27.791 --> 20:31.360
but I wasn't exactly
the best person.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.319
Or the best father,
for that matter.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.147
She may have mentioned it.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.150
It's because all the terrible
things she thinks about me

20:39.150 --> 20:40.630
are true.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.284
I've hurt a lot of people
during the course

20:42.284 --> 20:45.113
of my career, especially her.

20:47.028 --> 20:50.901
And that has haunted me
for most of my life.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.990
I'm not a great believer
in karma,

20:52.990 --> 20:58.822
but I suppose this cancer's
the universe's way of...

20:58.822 --> 21:03.174
balancing out everything
by giving me the ending

21:03.174 --> 21:04.741
that I deserve.

21:04.741 --> 21:08.919
Or maybe the universe
is giving you a chance

21:08.919 --> 21:12.488
to undo all the bad
you've done in the past

21:12.488 --> 21:16.231
by doing some good
here and now.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.843
Your daughter has a chance
to save a lot of people

21:19.843 --> 21:24.500
from a very dangerous drug,
but she can't do it alone.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.676
She could really use
your legal expertise.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.982
At this point, I don't think

21:27.982 --> 21:29.897
she wants anything
from me at all.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.683
Eli, this is your chance
to help people, not hurt them.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.033
And to finally be there
for Sandra

21:36.033 --> 21:37.948
when she needs you most.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.608
Oh, no.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.610
I know that face.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.873
It's the, "I've got news
and you're not

21:49.873 --> 21:52.049
going to like it, Ben," face.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.704
Jeane Tann was just
pronounced brain dead.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.104
Does Louis know?

22:04.148 --> 22:06.542
The nurses are waiting for
one of his doctors to tell him,

22:06.542 --> 22:09.153
and unfortunately,
Sandra's busy.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.851
So you're going
to have to do it, Ben.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.854
We were just talking
about her, Addison.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.029
I know.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.552
Bonding over how lucky
we were to have

22:16.552 --> 22:18.424
found the love of our life.

22:19.468 --> 22:24.560
And now, I have to go in there
and just destroy him?

22:24.560 --> 22:26.257
How do I do that?

22:28.869 --> 22:32.655
You won't remember this,
but I've had

22:32.655 --> 22:38.748
to once walk up to
a lovely home in the suburbs

22:38.748 --> 22:41.534
and tell a mother that
her only son died

22:41.534 --> 22:43.579
on a mission I led.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.756
Addison, I'm so sorry.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.584
She opened that door
and she took

22:48.584 --> 22:52.893
one look at me
and that Army Chaplain and...

22:52.893 --> 22:55.156
she knew.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.810
And my mind just went blank.

22:56.810 --> 23:02.642
My carefully
planned-out speech was gone.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.777
But in its place,

23:07.777 --> 23:11.172
the right words came to me.

23:12.782 --> 23:18.353
I told her that her son
sacrificed himself

23:18.353 --> 23:20.834
for this to be a better world.

23:20.834 --> 23:24.838
And that there's nothing
more noble than that.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.059
And I told her that sh--

23:29.059 --> 23:31.888
I told her that
her son was a hero.

23:33.237 --> 23:36.806
And that for myself
and everybody who knew him,

23:36.806 --> 23:39.853
we were forever changed because
of how he lived his life

23:39.853 --> 23:42.508
with hope and courage.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.815
I told her the truth
as it came to me

23:45.815 --> 23:50.254
from wherever
the truth comes from.

23:50.254 --> 23:57.348
<i>♪ I could possibly
be fading ♪</i>

23:59.786 --> 24:03.703
<i>♪ Or have</i>

24:03.703 --> 24:08.185
<i>♪ Something more to gain</i>

24:11.450 --> 24:16.411
<i>♪ I could feel myself</i>

24:16.411 --> 24:19.588
<i>♪ Growing colder</i>

24:22.591 --> 24:27.335
<i>♪ I could feel myself</i>

24:27.335 --> 24:31.078
<i>♪ Under your fate</i>

24:43.656 --> 24:45.788
Hey. Good news.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.747
I just talked to your dad
and he's agreed

24:47.747 --> 24:49.400
to take up the fight
against the hospital board

24:49.400 --> 24:52.099
to stop the use of Respiratrex.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.667
I never asked you to do that.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.929
Yeah.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.757
No, well--
yeah, but I just thought that,

24:57.757 --> 25:00.411
um, given your history,
it might be a great way

25:00.411 --> 25:02.544
to heal old wounds.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.546
Some wounds never heal.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.418
Well, I don't believe that.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.552
Sandra, I know Eli hasn't
exactly been the best dad,

25:10.552 --> 25:14.295
but he's trying to make things
right before it's too late.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.168
Too late?
Too late for what?

25:18.168 --> 25:19.387
<i>Code blue.</i>

25:19.387 --> 25:22.216
<i>ICU, room seven.
Repeat, code blue.</i>

25:22.216 --> 25:24.348
- Let's go.
<i>- ICU room seven.</i>

25:24.348 --> 25:25.349
We need to start a line.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.655
What happened?

25:26.655 --> 25:28.091
They got the shrapnel out
in surgery

25:28.091 --> 25:30.224
and everything seemed fine
until her vitals suddenly

25:30.224 --> 25:31.878
started bottoming out
and she went into V-tach.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.357
The Respiratrex.

25:33.357 --> 25:35.577
Kimberly Cole must be having
some kind of reaction.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.579
She's coding.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.067
Come on, Kimberly,
stay with us.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.416
Patient's asystolic.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.070
Get the crash cart.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
Ben, she means
a defibrillator.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.812
Over here.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.291
OK. What now?

25:54.291 --> 25:55.815
All right, set it to 100.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.294
OK. Slide it over.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.037
OK, now put one paddle
on her sternum

26:01.037 --> 26:02.256
and one on her left rib.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.562
And tell everyone to get clear.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.780
OK.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.741
Clear.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.613
Oh, come on.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.658
Ben, if you can't get
Kimberly's heart started--

26:12.658 --> 26:14.050
I know.
She's not responding.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.486
Increase the charge to 180.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.444
On it.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.619
- Come on.
- Clear.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.894
Normal rhythm.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.942
ST depressions are back
to baseline.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.948
But it won't last.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.341
There's already signs of severe
damage to all four chambers.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.126
Wait.
What does that mean?

26:46.126 --> 26:48.476
A heart transplant?

26:48.476 --> 26:51.435
I understand you're
frightened, Mrs. Cole.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.569
Rest assured, your daughter
is in the best of hands.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.658
Cedarhurst has one of
the top thoracic surgeons--

26:56.658 --> 26:59.661
This is the only way we
can save Kimberly's life now.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.621
If we can find a suitable donor
on such short notice.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.146
I will check
the donor registry.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.674
I don't know what psychic
hotline convinced you

27:12.674 --> 27:14.502
that girl has an
undiagnosed condition,

27:14.502 --> 27:17.505
or why you think I need
to work things out with Eli,

27:17.505 --> 27:18.811
but if there is
something going on,

27:18.811 --> 27:20.682
I need you to tell me
what it is.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.817
Not just doctor to doctor,
but friend to friend.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.039
Your father has
a tumor in his brain.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.871
Stage two glioblastoma.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.530
The average life expectancy
post diagnosis

27:42.530 --> 27:45.707
is 14 to 16 months, though
some people have been known

27:45.707 --> 27:47.709
to survive 10 years or longer.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.580
It's extremely rare,
but it is possible.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.670
Which is why he needs
to seek treatment tonight.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.455
It's the only way
he can survive this.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.152
I tried sending him
to oncology,

27:56.152 --> 27:57.980
but he wouldn't go.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.548
Stubborn son of a bitch.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.854
Why the hell not?

28:01.854 --> 28:03.986
Because he's lost
the only thing that

28:03.986 --> 28:06.685
can help him survive--hope.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.296
And I think we both know
there's only one person

28:09.296 --> 28:10.906
in here that
can give that back to him.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.308
So what do you think?

28:21.308 --> 28:22.744
Under different circumstances,

28:22.744 --> 28:25.704
Janis would have been
a part of this project.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.271
Looking at everything
that's happened,

28:28.271 --> 28:29.664
maybe she should have been.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.013
Magic, you aren't
seriously blaming

28:31.013 --> 28:32.711
yourself for any of this?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.277
What Ben did isn't your fault.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.583
He kept us all in the dark.

28:35.583 --> 28:38.542
But what happens next
will be on me.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.415
It's time to roll the dice.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.547
We've been playing catch up
this entire time.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.898
Now, whether we like it or not,

28:45.898 --> 28:49.118
Janis is our best chance at
understanding what's going on.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.737
Please tell me
you found a donor.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.218
Ian and I scoured the
entire UNOS waitlist for 1994

29:02.218 --> 29:05.482
and were able to find a match
on the organ donor registry.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.093
There's a "but" coming,
isn't there?

29:07.093 --> 29:09.704
She won't be dead
for another three months,

29:09.704 --> 29:11.924
which brings our chances
of finding a replacement heart

29:11.924 --> 29:13.795
down to 5%.

29:13.795 --> 29:18.887
And leaves Kimberly and me
completely screwed.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.417
OK, all right.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.854
Don't give up, Ben.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.246
We're going to
figure something out.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.161
Like what?

29:32.161 --> 29:33.510
Addison, you and I both know

29:33.510 --> 29:34.816
I was never supposed
to be the leaper,

29:34.816 --> 29:36.600
yet here I am
with three people's fates

29:36.600 --> 29:38.037
in my hand and not
a single clue

29:38.037 --> 29:39.516
how to help them all.

29:39.516 --> 29:42.128
OK, I know you can't
see this right now.

29:42.128 --> 29:45.087
But there is a reason
that you were sent here

29:45.087 --> 29:46.959
to save these three people.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.700
There is a bigger connection
that binds them, all right?

29:49.700 --> 29:52.834
You--you just have to find it.

29:56.316 --> 29:57.578
Wait.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.536
I might actually have an idea.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.368
You're sure there's
no chance of her

30:05.368 --> 30:07.370
ever coming back from this?

30:13.986 --> 30:16.771
My Jeane had the biggest
heart in the world.

30:16.771 --> 30:19.861
Always looking out
for other people.

30:19.861 --> 30:23.865
And, uh, right now
there's a young woman

30:23.865 --> 30:27.303
who needs that heart
in order to survive.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.871
I just...

30:29.871 --> 30:32.004
don't know
if I'm ready to let go.

30:34.920 --> 30:39.272
What happened to Jeane,
to Kimberly, to all of you

30:39.272 --> 30:41.796
on that train,
none of it's fair.

30:43.754 --> 30:46.975
But if your wife's heart
is as big as you say,

30:46.975 --> 30:49.586
I bet she'd want you
to do everything you could

30:49.586 --> 30:52.024
to prevent that accident
from cutting anyone else's

30:52.024 --> 30:55.201
life too short, too soon.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.917
Yes.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.484
She would.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
Yeah. Whew.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.997
For a second there, I thought
this might not work out.

31:54.434 --> 31:55.957
Oh, no.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.959
Kimberly's odds of survival
just started to plummet.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.613
What? Why?

31:59.613 --> 32:01.223
Because the surgeon that was
supposed to do the transplant

32:01.223 --> 32:03.443
got delayed, so Dr. Harper
is scrubbing in.

32:03.443 --> 32:06.011
If he uses Respiratrex--

32:06.011 --> 32:08.535
Kimberly Cole
is going to die.

32:15.455 --> 32:16.456
Sandra.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.936
Oh, Sandra, there you are.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.198
Do you not have your pager?

32:19.198 --> 32:20.677
Sorry, I--

32:20.677 --> 32:22.549
I guess I've just been
distracted since

32:22.549 --> 32:24.203
you dropped the bomb on me
that my father

32:24.203 --> 32:25.552
is basically at death's door.

32:25.552 --> 32:26.814
I should have told
you sooner.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.250
I'm sorry I didn't.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.904
But I've been trying to
save a lot of lives today.

32:29.904 --> 32:32.385
And there's one more I really
need your help with right now.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.605
- OK.
- OK. Come on.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.436
at 50.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.874
Hemo at 7.5,
vitals are holding.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.180
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.965
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.183
Medical emergency.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.402
Excuse me.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.708
Let's prep the chest
for incision.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.060
Showtime.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.235
Pardon me.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.845
Medical emergency!
Excuse me.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.238
Coming through.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.413
Once the heart is removed,
the tissue will only

33:00.413 --> 33:01.718
remain viable for so long.

33:01.718 --> 33:02.981
Every second counts.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.417
Now, let's do this, people.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.549
10ccs of Respiratrex.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.812
Stop.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.292
If you use that drug
on Kimberly again,

33:10.292 --> 33:11.554
it'll kill her.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.686
Turk, what the hell
are you doing?

33:12.686 --> 33:14.253
Something I should
have done sooner.

33:14.253 --> 33:15.689
Respiratrex is dangerous

33:15.689 --> 33:17.473
and we need to stop using it immediately.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.866
Get the hell out of my OR

33:18.866 --> 33:20.607
before I throw you both
out of this hospital.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.610
No, not until
you hear us out.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.786
Tomkinson, what--
have you gone insane?

33:25.786 --> 33:29.050
That's Dr. Tomkinson,
you misogynistic piece of--

33:29.050 --> 33:30.095
Alex, focus.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.661
Right, sorry.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.837
If you go through with this,

33:33.837 --> 33:35.491
you'll be risking exposing Cedarhurst

33:35.491 --> 33:37.537
to a major malpractice suit.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.321
You are a
first-year resident.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.931
You don't know how to deal
with the politics

33:40.931 --> 33:42.498
of how this place operates.

33:42.498 --> 33:43.630
I do.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.327
This hospital needs
that sponsorship.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.808
As doctors,
we vow to do no harm.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.463
That means putting the lives of
our patients before all else.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.421
Which is what
I'm trying to do.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.336
But for some
inexplicable reason,

33:54.336 --> 33:55.642
you two won't let me.

33:55.642 --> 33:58.166
Exposure to Respiratrex
triggered Kimberly's

33:58.166 --> 34:00.995
Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy
and caused irreparable damage

34:00.995 --> 34:02.083
to her heart.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.606
A second dose could kill her.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.869
Duchenne's is rare in girls.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.871
If she had it,
we would know by now.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.048
Show him the chart.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.920
Multiple biopsy results
with elevated dystrophia,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.314
which means her fate
is now in your hands.

34:15.314 --> 34:18.708
So what are you
going to do, Doctor?

34:27.413 --> 34:31.069
Give her 10ccs of Restanol.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.332
Now, if you don't mind,

34:33.332 --> 34:36.465
I have a heart
to transplant, Doctor.

34:42.732 --> 34:46.301
Hey, Nostradamus, nice catch.

34:53.439 --> 34:55.832
Starting tomorrow,
Dr. Harper suspends the use

34:55.832 --> 34:58.531
of Respiratrex and
convinces the hospital's board

34:58.531 --> 35:00.837
to break its contract
with the manufacturer.

35:00.837 --> 35:03.013
Once word gets out,
other hospitals follow suit

35:03.013 --> 35:07.366
and the FDA discontinues
the drug, permanently.

35:07.366 --> 35:12.197
Thank you for having
my back in there.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.895
Thank you for having mine.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.071
Even when I thought
I didn't want it.

35:18.899 --> 35:22.555
So, uh, about Eli?

35:22.555 --> 35:24.557
Ever since this custody
battle started,

35:24.557 --> 35:27.255
I've been preparing
for the worst--

35:27.255 --> 35:28.865
life without my son.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.259
It wasn't until today
seeing my father all alone

35:31.259 --> 35:35.698
that I finally understood how
sad and lonely that could be.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.744
He may not have been
the best father

35:37.744 --> 35:41.139
or even a good one,
for that matter,

35:41.139 --> 35:43.402
but he doesn't deserve
to go out

35:43.402 --> 35:45.317
feeling like he's got no one.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.407
Then you'll talk to him?

35:48.407 --> 35:51.758
Get him to seek treatment,
like, today?

35:51.758 --> 35:54.587
Already reserved his spot
with oncology.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.415
They're just waiting
on me to drag

35:56.415 --> 35:58.808
his stubborn ass down there.

36:08.253 --> 36:11.212
You know, for a guy who
just saved hundreds of lives

36:11.212 --> 36:13.301
over the next few years,

36:13.301 --> 36:15.999
you don't seem very happy
about it.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.264
Today was a lot.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.700
Yeah.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.876
What these doctors
and nurses have to deal with

36:22.876 --> 36:24.399
on a daily basis,

36:24.399 --> 36:28.011
the constant
life and death stakes,

36:28.011 --> 36:29.535
those folks are heroes.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.101
That's true.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.801
But arguably, so are you.

36:34.801 --> 36:39.197
Think about all the lives
that you've changed already.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.373
I guess.

36:41.373 --> 36:44.158
There's still one life
I'm worried about.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.464
Ben.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.553
Ever since I remembered
why I left,

36:47.553 --> 36:51.165
I can't help but wonder,
what if?

36:51.165 --> 36:54.995
What if the moment of truth
comes and I fail?

36:54.995 --> 36:59.434
What if all of this was
for nothing and I let you down?

37:01.349 --> 37:03.395
OK.

37:03.395 --> 37:05.701
First of all,
I can save myself.

37:05.701 --> 37:08.835
So let's just put that
on the table right now, OK?

37:08.835 --> 37:12.317
But secondly,
if that time comes,

37:12.317 --> 37:15.929
if I am in a life
and death situation,

37:15.929 --> 37:18.410
I know I'm not
going to be alone.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.631
I'll have you, Ben.

37:22.631 --> 37:27.201
Just like you were there
for all of those people today.

37:27.201 --> 37:30.639
<i>You gave an estranged father
and his daughter</i>

37:30.639 --> 37:33.729
<i>hope that they could
be a family again.</i>

37:35.775 --> 37:39.605
<i>You gave a young woman
a second chance</i>

37:39.605 --> 37:43.304
<i>at a lifetime
of possibilities.</i>

37:46.525 --> 37:50.050
<i>You gave a man peace</i>

37:50.050 --> 37:52.661
<i>to know
that the love of his life</i>

37:52.661 --> 37:55.185
<i>didn't die for nothing.</i>

37:56.578 --> 37:59.973
And that is why no matter
what the future holds,

37:59.973 --> 38:01.627
I'm not afraid.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.284
Neither should you be.

38:22.952 --> 38:26.695
Finally, someone
listens to me.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.134
Captain Augustine, I was
really hoping to meet you

38:31.134 --> 38:32.788
under better circumstances.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.137
And yet, here we are.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.835
I want you to understand
that I am only here

38:35.835 --> 38:38.054
because Magic asked me
to honor your request.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.928
There is an
incredible myopia that

38:41.928 --> 38:44.452
has descended over all of you.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.673
But you, most of all.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.501
Do you really think
I wanted Ben

38:49.501 --> 38:51.111
to come to me instead of you?

38:51.111 --> 38:53.113
Do you think I was thrilled
that he walked into my life

38:53.113 --> 38:54.767
and dropped a world
of problems in my lap?

38:54.767 --> 38:56.769
Because I actually have a life.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.902
Or I had one before he
showed up and told me a story

38:59.902 --> 39:02.514
that made me drop everything.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.646
So I am sorry.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.692
I'm sorry that I'm not
particularly sympathetic

39:06.692 --> 39:08.520
to your ignorance,
but in this case,

39:08.520 --> 39:11.218
I can promise you,
ignorance is bliss.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.747
What were you working on?

39:18.747 --> 39:21.663
OK, why did Ben leap?

39:22.795 --> 39:24.797
Why am I in danger?

39:24.797 --> 39:26.015
If you weren't going
to say anything,

39:26.015 --> 39:27.713
why did you want
this conversation?

39:27.713 --> 39:31.151
Because I need you
to tell Ben to stop talking...

39:31.151 --> 39:32.674
to you.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.502
You need to go in
that imaging chamber,

39:34.502 --> 39:36.765
and you need to tell him
that from now on,

39:36.765 --> 39:41.770
anything he remembers,
he must keep to himself.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.946
You want us
to stop helping him?

39:43.946 --> 39:46.427
No, I want you
to stop doubting him.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.994
You say you trust him.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.822
Well, there is a very
good reason he didn't

39:49.822 --> 39:51.519
tell you anything, Addison.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.434
Because the problem
with information

39:53.434 --> 39:56.350
is that the only place
we can really keep it secret

39:56.350 --> 39:58.874
is in our mind.

39:58.874 --> 40:02.530
Because once you say it
out loud to someone else

40:02.530 --> 40:06.099
in a world with
a Quantum Accelerator,

40:06.099 --> 40:08.449
everyone knows,

40:08.449 --> 40:11.670
including the people
who sent Richard Martínez.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.455
You want to help Ben,
you will tell him

40:14.455 --> 40:16.326
to trust no one.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.374
Even you.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.305
Running a little
behind schedule.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.828
Yeah, everything looks good.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.961
Startup will be quick.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.224
Ever seen one before,
Colonel?

40:47.488 --> 40:49.098
Seen what?

41:07.160 --> 41:09.205
It's far out.

41:09.205 --> 41:12.295
Like something out
of a science fiction book.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.472
Just wait until you see

41:14.472 --> 41:17.387
what this nuclear reactor
can do.
