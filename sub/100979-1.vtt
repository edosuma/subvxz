Otherwise they go to waste.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.817
- You're single.
- [laughs]

02:31.235 --> 02:32.444
These must be clairvoyant.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.951
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.037
Oh! Sorry.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.956
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.791
I hate when people
have their faces in their phones

[camera shutter]

02:49.002 --> 02:50.629
I think I may have
just taken a picture.

- I hope it's a good one.
- [laughs quietly]

02:56.134 --> 02:57.135
Do I know you?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.513
I feel like I know you.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.806
I'd remember meeting you.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.727
- You want a beet?
- Let me guess, first one's free?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.437
You are on to me.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.607
Um.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.694
It was nice running in to you.

03:13.944 --> 03:14.987
You as well.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.535
[solemn piano music]

03:26.498 --> 03:28.166
- [Mackenzie] Are you okay?
- [Aria] Yeah.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.419
- Yeah, why?
- You seem a little...

03:30.836 --> 03:31.837
off.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.300
[groans]
Okay, I feel off. Yeah.

03:37.176 --> 03:40.345
You know it's like...
somebody came into my house

03:40.429 --> 03:42.264
and rearranged
a bunch of stuff in the night.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.266
Like what?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.350
Spoons.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.186
[Aria] Yeah, well...

03:47.686 --> 03:50.063
the thing is they're actually
in a better drawer

03:50.147 --> 03:52.858
and it makes more sense,
but it's still just weird.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.694
[Mackenzie] what about the show?
Is everything kosher?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.115
- Do you like the space?
- This is really good.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.159
- Did they change the roast?
- Good talk.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.454
[exclaims in disgust]

04:05.829 --> 04:08.332
[Mackenzie] I'll see you soon.
Get there early.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.458
We're not on Aria time.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.214
- Hey, Mackenzie.
- Hi, human.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.216
I don't know what it is,

04:18.300 --> 04:19.760
but I get the feeling
that she doesn't like me.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.845
What makes you think that?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.055
Intuition.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.057
Oh!

04:27.809 --> 04:28.810
Her loss.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.356
[Thomas] This is awful!
Is this a different roast?

04:32.439 --> 04:33.440
[Aria] Thomas, what do you want?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.488
Wow. I can't just stop by
and say hello?

04:39.905 --> 04:40.906
Yeah, you can.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.491
Are you?

04:44.660 --> 04:45.661
What?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.498
Come on, Ari.
What do I have to do?

04:49.706 --> 04:50.707
I need more time.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.543
Yeah well, I know.
I'm trying to give you space

04:52.626 --> 04:54.920
I am, but could you just stop
and talk to me for a second?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.380
You want to talk?
Be there tonight.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.132
- What?
- My art show. The gallery.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.968
Yeah. I'm gonna be there.
But could you just hear me out?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.014
- Way to go, champ.
- Whoops.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.100
Excuse me?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.435
It's none of my business,

05:10.561 --> 05:12.646
but I don't think pressuring her

05:12.729 --> 05:14.106
is going to
get you what you want.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.152
- And you are?
- Have you ever thought

05:19.361 --> 05:21.071
that maybe
you don't make her happy?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
[laughs mirthlessly]

05:24.116 --> 05:25.200
- Uh?
- Just a thought.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.995
Again, none of my business.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.163
Have an excellent day.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.013
- [Aria] Oh. Whoa!
- [Ben] What do you see?

05:46.180 --> 05:50.058
[Aria] I see
a bottle of detergent.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.269
Yeah, it's like...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.104
- laundry detergent.
- [Ben and Mackenzie laugh]

05:54.271 --> 05:56.565
- Okay.
- [Ben] No, no, no, it's okay.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.649
It's okay.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.526
Everybody does it
the first time.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.696
[Ben] So...
that's augmented reality or AR.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.781
[Mackenzie] You should hear
him and the other programmers

06:04.865 --> 06:05.908
- geek out over this.
- Wow!

06:06.325 --> 06:07.910
[Mackenzie] Tell her
what you guys call the code.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.661
- Go on!
- DNA.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.371
[Mackenzie]
It takes a lot longer to say.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.623
[Ben]
First, that was an inside joke.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.832
So, thank you for that.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.418
Second, DNA is code.

06:17.044 --> 06:23.217
[Ben] And ours is immersive.
Dimensional. Disruptive.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.554
Until, of course,
VR really takes off

06:27.638 --> 06:29.556
and we're spending
most of our days

06:29.640 --> 06:31.808
in the virtual world.
But that's years away.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.435
AR is now.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.479
Oh my God.
That sounds horrible.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.314
[Ben] No. Why...
what do you mean?

06:38.774 --> 06:40.609
I mean the virtual thing.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.070
[Aria] Yeah, I'm sure

06:43.153 --> 06:45.280
there are people
that would love to live in...

06:47.282 --> 06:49.284
- you know.
- [Ben] So... yes.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.162
[Aria] I... I like books.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.623
[laughs quietly]
I like the way that the...

06:55.332 --> 06:57.334
pages smell
when they get old and...

06:58.585 --> 07:01.588
I like paints
and oil paints and brushes.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.383
I guess I...

07:04.842 --> 07:07.094
I like the way real things feel.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.596
[Aria] I'm very...

07:09.721 --> 07:11.807
tactile in that way, I guess.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.727
[Ben] I could listen to you
talk all day.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.604
- [Aria laughs]
- Just being honest.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.189
- But I'm taking these away.
- [Aria] Okay.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.734
[Ben] Your style is exactly

07:22.818 --> 07:25.028
the aesthetic we're going for
with this campaign.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.655
The images need a strong voice

07:26.738 --> 07:28.574
that resonates
with a female demographic.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.868
And we want them
to feel hand-painted.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.452
- So...
- Why not

07:32.536 --> 07:34.621
get a female to hand-paint them?

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
Yeah.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.499
Yes.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.793
- [Aria chuckles]
- Mackenzie tells me you have...

07:40.294 --> 07:41.837
- an exhibition tonight?
- [Mackenzie] Yes!

07:41.920 --> 07:42.921
Um...

07:43.338 --> 07:44.590
that might be giving it

07:44.673 --> 07:46.508
a bit more credit
than it deserves.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.635
It's just a small gallery

07:48.719 --> 07:50.846
where a few of my paintings
are hanging in Silverlake.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.931
[Ben] Okay,
well I think that sounds rad.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.683
And I'm looking forward to it.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.393
Because I'm gonna be there.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.645
Okay.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.231
Take some time.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.316
Mull it over.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.151
I think we can do
great work together.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.694
Yeah?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.905
So... you.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.616
- [Mackenzie chuckles]
- And I'll see you later.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.117
[Ben] Thank you.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.538
I like real things?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.875
I know... I know, I know.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.668
- Who are you?
- But I do. I do.

09:11.677 --> 09:12.761
Thomas, are you here?

09:38.996 --> 09:40.539
So... streamlined
the mission statement

09:40.622 --> 09:42.332
and added the bits
here and here.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.001
Underwriting sponsorships
and matched funding.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.252

- Okay.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.130
Oh. I've got to take this.
You want to take a look?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.548
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
Hey, you.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.012
- Look, I'm sorry about...
- It's a sweet gesture.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.472
[Aria] But you can't
let yourself in like that.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.766
- They're your favorite right?
- Yeah,

09:59.850 --> 10:01.560
they're beautiful. It's just...

10:01.852 --> 10:03.270
[Aria] You can't do stuff
like this anymore.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.899
I... I do miss my teammate.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.240
- Hello?
- [Janine] Thomas,

10:16.116 --> 10:17.826
- I like it. It works.
- Great.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.205
- Grosse Pointe meeting.
- Oh. Yeah.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.539
[Ben] I'll be there. Hey, Ari?

10:22.664 --> 10:23.665
Can we sort this out later?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.292
- Sure.
- Thanks.

10:25.709 --> 10:26.877
Bye.

Be with me. Be with me.
Be with me.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.872
Be with me. Be with me.

11:45.581 --> 11:49.334
Be with me. Be with me.
Be with me.

11:50.169 --> 11:54.047
Be with me. Be with me.
Be with me.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.134
Be with me.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.693
[Janine] All right.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.279
We have you
slated to help with the...

12:18.197 --> 12:21.658
Long Beach fundraiser...
in October.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.578
Couldn't do what we do
without our volunteers.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.080
- So, thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.582
I'm psyched, as the kids say.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.292
Or used to say. I don't know.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.753
[Joel chuckles] I'm pumped?

12:33.462 --> 12:34.463
So...

12:35.172 --> 12:36.548
do you work here alone?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.260
Oh god! That sounded horrible.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.346
I only asked because I spend

12:42.429 --> 12:43.555
most of my time in a dark room

12:43.639 --> 12:45.557
- at the university.
- Oh!

12:46.225 --> 12:48.519
Wow, I didn't realize
anyone still shot on film.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.104
- That's great.
- Dark room, right.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.315
Uh, no.
Not that kind of dark room.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.609
Computers.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.194
I do data modeling.

12:57.819 --> 12:58.904
Sport of the future.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.032
Point being, they've got me...

13:02.824 --> 13:04.034
down in the basement.

13:04.326 --> 13:08.038
Alone. 12, 14 hours a day and...

13:09.540 --> 13:12.417
I don't have much of a life
outside of work and honestly...

13:12.584 --> 13:15.254
that kind of isolation
can get to you after a while.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.422
Yeah.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.175
Well, luckily
I've got a business partner.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.718
Thank god,

13:21.802 --> 13:23.262
I don't think
I could do this by myself.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.390
Actually,
he should be back any minute.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.394
Remind me what that's like.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.271
Having someone
to collaborate with.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.399
You two
work well with each other?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.442
Yeah.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.987
Yeah, he's great actually.

13:40.571 --> 13:43.240
You know, passionate and smart.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.201
Energy for days and caring.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.705
- Yeah, I got a good one.
- Oh,

13:49.997 --> 13:50.998
you two are together?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.877
Together together? No.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.131
- No, it's strictly professional.
- You sure?

14:00.215 --> 14:01.508
Because your eyes
kind of light up

14:01.592 --> 14:02.593
when you talk about him.

14:04.970 --> 14:05.971
[Joel laughs]

14:06.054 --> 14:09.641
- I, um...
- Sorry, sorry, I'm gonna go.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.855
Thank you.
And I'll see you in Long Beach.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.523
Water for the world.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.108
Water for the world.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.071
And it's none of my business,

14:23.197 --> 14:25.449
but tell him how you feel.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.492
You won't regret it.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.453
I promise.

[dissonant note]

15:42.484 --> 15:44.236
- Whoa, whoa... whoa.
- [music fades]

15:45.487 --> 15:47.531
Hey,
didn't we do this earlier today?

15:47.781 --> 15:50.784
At the market, you ran into me,
kind of like now, only...

15:54.872 --> 15:56.373
Sorry, just out for a walk.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.375
Do you live around here?

15:59.543 --> 16:00.544
Uh, yeah.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.754
A couple of streets over,
on Rosemont.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.464
Uh, you mean Rosemary.
[laughs]

16:04.548 --> 16:06.258
No,
I'm pretty sure it's Rosemont.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.886
Yeah, I've lived in this area
for a while

16:08.969 --> 16:11.346
and it's three streets over.
It's Rosemary.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.140
Hey.
Not here to argue cartography

16:13.223 --> 16:14.266
with you or whatever.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.685
Sorry I freaked you out. Okay?

16:17.311 --> 16:18.770
Really. Have a good night.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.440
Yeah... I will.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.365
[rock music]

16:43.670 --> 16:44.838
[Mackenzie]
Don't get down about this.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.965
It takes a while
to get a following.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.300
[Aria] No it's fine.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.384
It's just...

16:49.718 --> 16:52.387
I don't know.
I'm having a really odd day.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.557
[sighs]
I thought Thomas would be here.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.977
I thought you two were
taking some time off.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.062
I invited him.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.982
But, it's not like
we're actually together.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.108
So I can't be disappointed,
right?

17:06.484 --> 17:07.486
[phone chimes]

17:07.819 --> 17:10.196
Hey, Ben will be here
in five minutes.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.074
- Are you trying to set us up?
- You and Ben?

17:13.242 --> 17:15.493
- No.
- Because it kind of sounds like

17:15.577 --> 17:16.954
- you're trying to set us up.
- Okay,

17:17.329 --> 17:18.497
Ben is a great guy.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.665
And you could do
a hell of a lot worse.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.584
But this is more about

17:22.667 --> 17:24.795
feeding
that crazy artist in here,

17:25.503 --> 17:27.798
- while feeding her here.
- [snaps teeth]

17:28.298 --> 17:29.299
[Mackenzie laughs]

17:30.175 --> 17:31.176
I don't know, just...

17:31.760 --> 17:34.304
selling detergent while
the world is falling apart.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.349
Hey! You wouldn't
just be selling detergent.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.811
There's...
juice boxes, cereals...

17:41.478 --> 17:42.479
toilet paper.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.189
[both laugh quietly]

17:45.691 --> 17:47.442
Um... should we mingle?

17:53.991 --> 17:54.992
I guess not.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.327
[both laugh]

17:58.787 --> 18:00.789
You know I just
want you to be happy, right?

18:00.873 --> 18:01.957
[Aria]
Yeah, I'm not sure

18:02.040 --> 18:03.959
- happiness is really a thing.
- Fine.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.377
Fuck happiness.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.795
Call it whatever you want.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.380
I just want you fulfilled.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.426
This one.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.012
Yep, this one is my favorite.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.139
It's like she's saying...

18:17.347 --> 18:19.808
I'm not going anywhere,
motherfucker.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.145
It's yours.

18:23.604 --> 18:24.605
No.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.400
- No.
- Yes. I want you to have it.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.029
Really?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.947
Because she's my favorite.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.993
You're a really great friend,
Mack.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.540
What was that?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.292
You're the best.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.877
And I'm not going anywhere...

18:47.377 --> 18:48.378
motherfucker.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.342
I'm not going anywhere,
motherf...

18:55.928 --> 18:57.262
- Really?
- I can't.

19:34.967 --> 19:35.968
[eerie music]

19:39.680 --> 19:40.681
[quietly] What?

19:43.976 --> 19:44.977
It's like I don't live here.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.062
[crackle]

19:59.783 --> 20:02.119
It's Rosemont... the street.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
It's Rosemont.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.705
Again, last night,

20:04.788 --> 20:05.956
- I'm sorry if I scared you.
- No.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.249
I'm sorry.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.835
I could have sworn
the street was Rosemary.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.338
It's like,
I remember it being Rosemary.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.465
- Weird, right?
- The Mandela Effect.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.302
- Sorry?
- It's this phenomenon.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.388
Groups of people who remember
alternate versions of things.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.639
It could be something big.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.725
Like how many states
there are in the U.S.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.685
Or a little thing,
like Rosemary,

20:27.394 --> 20:29.813
- Rosemont.
- You're a weird one, aren't you?

20:30.981 --> 20:32.774
You may not have been
stalking me the other night.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.359
But you're definitely weird.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.904
I like it.
[laughs quietly]

20:37.112 --> 20:38.113
Be right back.

20:39.740 --> 20:40.741
[unnerving music]

20:42.659 --> 20:47.039
[whispering] Be with me,
be with me, be with me.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.141
Yeah, that's not creepy.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.602
I'm just taking
a moment to be grateful.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.146
- What are we grateful for?
- Oh, you know,

21:11.480 --> 21:15.067
good coffee,
sunshine, charming strangers.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.152
Oh, cheers.

21:18.403 --> 21:21.156
Well, we both know I'm charming,
but you?

21:21.240 --> 21:23.700
I can be charming.
I'm keeping it in check.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.118
Just for your sake.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.203
Really?

21:26.453 --> 21:27.913
So once you let loose,
that's it.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.290
- Women are helpless.
- Some people call it a gift,

21:30.374 --> 21:32.960
but me, I also call it a gift.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.879
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

21:41.260 --> 21:44.638
Okay, so tell me more
about this Mandela craziness.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.599
- Blow my mind.
- Okay. Well,

21:47.891 --> 21:49.977
you already think I'm weird.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.354
There's a huge group of people

21:52.437 --> 21:54.022
who all have the same memory

21:54.189 --> 21:56.233
of Nelson Mandela
dying in prison.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.444
Well, except he was released.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.989
And then later on became
president of South Africa.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.991
Right.
But there are 1000s of people

22:04.074 --> 22:05.784
who remember
something different.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.494
Okay. So,
it's like an alternate version

22:07.578 --> 22:09.955
of history.
Like different realities?

22:10.455 --> 22:12.332
[Joel] That somehow
merged with this one.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.377
Yeah, I don't buy it.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.963
Me neither. But it's
a fun thought experiment.

22:18.589 --> 22:20.299
I mean, I'm a sucker
for that kind of stuff.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.801
You know, urban legends,
occult phenomena,

22:23.677 --> 22:25.012
- ancient myths.
- Yeah.

22:25.888 --> 22:28.140
Bigfoot. UFOs. Weirdo stuff.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.185
[Aria] No, no, no.
I think it's a really cool idea.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.769
I do. I just, you know...

22:33.312 --> 22:34.396
- If there...
- [phone chimes]

22:34.563 --> 22:36.940
- were an alternate reality, I...
- [phone chimes]

22:37.649 --> 22:39.151
- [Aria] Sorry.
- Do you need to get that?

22:39.234 --> 22:40.402
- No, I know who it is.
- [phone chimes]

22:40.485 --> 22:41.486
It's just...

22:41.695 --> 22:42.779
- Wow, there's three.
- [phone chimes]

22:42.863 --> 22:43.864
And four.

22:45.908 --> 22:47.576
Four. Comes after three.

22:47.784 --> 22:48.785
I just wanted you to know

22:48.869 --> 22:50.329
- that I could count.
- Wait a minute.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.247
When I learned to count
it was one, two, three, five.

22:54.666 --> 22:55.918
Are you trying to Mandela me?

22:56.668 --> 22:57.669
[Aria laughs]

22:58.462 --> 22:59.463
All right, well...

22:59.963 --> 23:01.256
this was lovely but

23:01.340 --> 23:02.341
[whispering] I have to go.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.135
'Til next time?

23:05.219 --> 23:06.220
[whispering] Yeah, bye.

23:15.229 --> 23:16.313
[Thomas]
You've already talked to

23:16.396 --> 23:18.148
allocations about setting aside
a percentage for us?

23:18.232 --> 23:20.526
With the chance of their
annual contribution increasing

23:20.609 --> 23:23.278
by five percent
over the next five years.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.614
- [Janine laughs]
- That's awesome.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.241
- [continues laughing]
- [exclaims in joy]

23:27.324 --> 23:28.784
That's huge.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.370
You're a superstar.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.334
What?

23:38.502 --> 23:39.920
Oh, come on, Janine. What?

23:42.589 --> 23:43.590
What is it?

23:44.383 --> 23:45.384
[Thomas laughs nervously]

23:46.927 --> 23:48.595
I'm sure
this isn't the right time.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.683
But how do I say this?

23:55.727 --> 23:56.728
I...

23:58.605 --> 23:59.606
I have been feeling...

23:59.940 --> 24:01.024
for a long time...

24:01.692 --> 24:02.693
that...

24:03.819 --> 24:04.945
that I...I

24:06.613 --> 24:08.198
I have wanted to tell you...

24:10.158 --> 24:11.159
Aria!

24:12.077 --> 24:14.079
- Oh. Hi, Janine.
- Hi!

24:15.455 --> 24:17.708
- How are you?
- I'm great. And you?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.501
I'm well.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.170
Thanks.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.173
We miss you around here.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.261
Um...

24:29.803 --> 24:30.804
chamber of silence?

24:33.807 --> 24:34.808
Good seeing you.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.769
- Let's get lunch sometime.
- Sure, yeah.

24:45.277 --> 24:46.486
This is hard on me too.

24:46.737 --> 24:47.863
But you can't pressure me.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.656
And making up reasons
why we need to talk, it's...

24:49.740 --> 24:51.074
Do I make you happy?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.161
[stammers]

24:54.494 --> 24:56.496
Um... do I...

24:56.997 --> 24:58.165
when we were together, did...

24:59.333 --> 25:00.375
did I make you happy?

25:01.710 --> 25:02.794
Thomas, what is this?

25:05.881 --> 25:07.716
It's stupid,
but some guy on the street

25:07.799 --> 25:09.009
said almost
the exact same thing.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.177
that I shouldn't pressure you.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.137
And maybe
I didn't make you happy.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.516
That's what I thought.
You wouldn't know this guy?

25:15.599 --> 25:17.017
He was kind of tall,
kind of big.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.061
I guess it doesn't matter.

25:19.895 --> 25:20.896
[Joel] One, two.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.148
You say you know who it is.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.150
You put your phone away.

25:26.151 --> 25:27.402
You put it on silent.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.363
You apologize...

25:29.821 --> 25:31.532
and you put it in your purse.

25:32.074 --> 25:35.869
[Thomas] I miss you... everyday.
I miss how

25:35.953 --> 25:37.037
great we were together.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.249
Mostly.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.918
Meaning?

25:43.836 --> 25:46.088
[Aria] Last night. The gallery?

25:46.463 --> 25:48.799
Oh,
I'm so sorry about that. Really.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.133
I know,
I should have been there.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.720
I told you I was gonna be there
but I... I knew you wanted time.

25:54.429 --> 25:55.430
I invited you.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.099
[Thomas sighs] Look, I think...

25:58.141 --> 25:59.142
sometimes...

25:59.685 --> 26:00.936
with the work that we do here
which...

26:01.019 --> 26:03.355
you know, it's so essential,
so needed. I...

26:04.231 --> 26:06.692
I forget other things in life
might be important too.

26:08.944 --> 26:12.197
Are they? Or am I selfish.

26:13.824 --> 26:14.825
Well...

26:14.908 --> 26:16.785
we're all a little selfish.
I mean...

26:19.663 --> 26:20.998
Okay,
I'm going to be honest with you,

26:21.248 --> 26:22.374
It doesn't make sense to me.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.668
Not after
all we've done together.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.253
But I'm not you.

26:26.336 --> 26:30.132
I don't have... the artists fire
or whatever people call it.

26:30.215 --> 26:34.052
So... if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

26:34.887 --> 26:36.221
Yeah, but it hasn't been.

26:36.763 --> 26:37.764
It will be.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.474
It is. I promise you.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.643
[Joel] Market.

26:42.603 --> 26:43.604
Rosemont.

26:44.688 --> 26:45.689
Cafe.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.649
- Text messages.
- [eerie music]

26:48.609 --> 26:52.279
One... two... three...

26:54.615 --> 26:56.366
- Four, comes after three,
- four.

26:56.450 --> 26:58.243
I just wanted you
to know that I could count.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.620
It's never been four.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.178
[yelling] Fuck! Fuck!

27:16.678 --> 27:18.555
[Thomas]
Look, I might not be able

27:18.639 --> 27:19.806
to live completely
in your world,

27:19.890 --> 27:21.725
and maybe you
can't have both feet in mine.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.019
But there's enough
between us here.

27:25.229 --> 27:26.438
[Thomas]
We shouldn't throw that away.

27:28.398 --> 27:29.858
You have
to know that I love you.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.154
Only you.

27:36.949 --> 27:37.950
[holds back tears]

27:45.290 --> 27:46.458
- [unsettling music]
- [breathes loudly]

28:06.353 --> 28:08.772
[Mackenzie]
No... no, no.

28:09.064 --> 28:10.065
Okay, dramatic much?

28:10.566 --> 28:12.484
How can you even consider that?

28:12.651 --> 28:14.236
Because I can still
do my art on the side.

28:14.611 --> 28:15.612
You already tried that.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.031
Look, I know you don't
want to hear this.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.158
- Then don't say it.
- But if he loved you,

28:20.284 --> 28:21.451
if he really, really loved you,

28:21.535 --> 28:22.953
then he would
want you to be happy.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.289
And none of this,
"happiness doesn't exist" crap.

28:25.372 --> 28:28.250
- You know what I mean.
- I think he does. Really.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.878
- [Mackenzie sighs] Jesus.
- What?

28:32.546 --> 28:33.547
You don't love him.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.424
Okay. Wow.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.758
You don't.

28:37.134 --> 28:39.178
[Mackenzie] Look,
I know you think I hate Thomas.

28:39.970 --> 28:43.265
I don't. It's just I hate
that he's not right for you.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.059
And he knows it. He does.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.648
All right, fine.
I hate him a little bit.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.902
But in the nicest possible way.

28:54.985 --> 28:57.404
You are such a pain in the ass.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.617
[Aria] But I know you just want
what's best for me.

29:01.992 --> 29:03.202
[Mackenzie] One of us has to.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.666
[eerie music]

30:04.221 --> 30:05.222
[car door shuts]

30:11.436 --> 30:12.896
- [glass shatters]
- [quietly] Fuck!

30:15.190 --> 30:18.068
- [Mackenzie laughs]
- Wait. Did you just hear that?

30:19.695 --> 30:20.821
It sounded like glass breaking.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.743
[whispering] What?
Walking towards the scary sound?

30:26.869 --> 30:28.537
[quietly] Aren't we
supposed to call the cops?

30:29.496 --> 30:31.540
And tell them what?
That we heard a scary noise?

30:33.917 --> 30:34.918
[calls out] Hello?

30:36.128 --> 30:37.129
Like they're gonna answer?

30:38.672 --> 30:39.715
Just hold on.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.055
Hello?

30:50.934 --> 30:51.935
Come on.

30:55.647 --> 30:56.648
Shit.

31:00.777 --> 31:01.945
[Mackenzie]
Could that have fallen?

31:03.864 --> 31:04.865
No.

31:06.116 --> 31:09.828
[Mackenzie] Outside. Let's go.
Come on. Come on!

31:31.767 --> 31:32.809
Shall we restart?

31:38.941 --> 31:40.359
Something different.

31:42.611 --> 31:44.863
Let's try something different.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.041
[glass shatters]

32:00.963 --> 32:02.673
[loud tearing]

32:19.731 --> 32:21.441
[Officer Bowman] Well,
there's no sign of forced entry,

32:21.525 --> 32:22.526
which is good.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.528
Can you tell if there's
anything else missing?

32:25.070 --> 32:27.281
Um... I don't know, but I...

32:27.406 --> 32:28.407
I didn't check everything.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.576
[Bowman] Well I do suggest
getting these locks changed.

32:30.659 --> 32:31.660
Just to be safe.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.328
Now can you stay
with a friend until then?

32:34.288 --> 32:35.497
As if you have to ask.

32:35.581 --> 32:37.457
- She's going to stay with me.
- Great.

32:37.749 --> 32:39.918
[Mackenzie] At least
until I get my own stalker.

32:40.836 --> 32:41.837
You don't want that.

32:42.754 --> 32:43.755
Have a good night ladies.

32:45.007 --> 32:46.425
[Bowman]
Please lock up behind me.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.145
[Thomas] All right. Well,
maybe we can reschedule or...

32:58.228 --> 33:00.189
I mean, do they have any leads?
It's just...

33:00.814 --> 33:02.900
- I don't want you to be alone.
- [Aria] No, no, no. I'm not.

33:02.983 --> 33:04.443
I'm staying
with Mackenzie tonight.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.652
[Thomas] Oh good!

33:05.736 --> 33:06.987
- No, you go.
- Tell her I said hi.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.071
He says, "Hey".

33:09.364 --> 33:10.449
- She says, "Hey" back.
- Yeah,

33:10.532 --> 33:11.700
I'm sure she does.

33:12.326 --> 33:14.203
Listen, you'll stay with her
until I get back from Michigan?

33:14.661 --> 33:16.455
Yeah, what time is your flight?

33:19.166 --> 33:21.335
- About three and a half hours.
- Oh, ouch.

33:22.794 --> 33:25.172
Well,
I hope the fundraiser goes well.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.049
- Thank you, honey.
- Is Janine going?

33:28.133 --> 33:31.053
Tell my guest my
business partner will be going.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.097
I love you.

33:35.599 --> 33:36.600
You, too.

33:36.683 --> 33:37.976
- Text me when you land?
- Of course.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.186
Good night, beautiful.

33:55.827 --> 33:56.828
Thomas.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.998
- [both laugh]
- [Mackenzie] Oh my god.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.127
Back to the stalker dude.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.420
Or woman.

34:05.796 --> 34:07.214
- We don't want to be sexist.
- Of course.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.842
Let's say he...
or she does exist.

34:11.426 --> 34:12.969
Do you have any idea
of who he could be?

34:13.344 --> 34:14.346
No, I...

34:14.763 --> 34:15.764
Oh, well...

34:16.723 --> 34:18.058
There is this one guy.

34:18.809 --> 34:20.643
I don't know though.
He seems pretty normal.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.688
- But is he cute.
- No, he's handsome, yeah.

34:24.773 --> 34:26.108
He's pretty charming too.

34:26.567 --> 34:29.152
We've actually
run into each other.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.737
Yeah. A couple of times. It's...

34:32.739 --> 34:33.907
Oh, wait. Here.

34:35.742 --> 34:36.743
[screams quietly]

34:37.619 --> 34:38.620
[Mackenzie chuckles]

34:38.871 --> 34:40.706
Are you sure you're
not the one doing the stalking?

34:40.789 --> 34:42.206
[Aria laughs] No.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.042
- [Mackenzie laughs]
- He took that photo.

34:44.168 --> 34:45.168
Well, accidentally.

34:45.252 --> 34:46.628
I dropped my phone
and then it...

34:47.462 --> 34:48.797
like, took a picture.
It was weird.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.382
You have to introduce us.

34:50.966 --> 34:53.135
- To my stalker.
- Alleged stalker.

34:53.677 --> 34:54.678
Even if he was,

34:54.887 --> 34:56.096
two birds, one stone.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.056
Because once you go Mack...

34:58.515 --> 35:00.267
you never go back.

35:00.601 --> 35:01.810
[both laugh]

35:22.831 --> 35:24.249
- [Joel] Hey.
- Oh my god!

35:24.374 --> 35:27.002
[chuckles] Sorry.
I did not mean to startle you.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.086
[Janine pants]

35:28.629 --> 35:31.673
I just had one more question
about the Long Beach fundraiser.

35:31.924 --> 35:32.925
Do you have a second?

35:34.009 --> 35:35.010
Um...

35:48.315 --> 35:50.442
I'm not going anywhere,
motherf...

35:51.068 --> 35:53.654
[laughs quietly then sighs]

36:01.370 --> 36:02.371
[crackle]

36:09.461 --> 36:10.462
[unnerving music]

36:20.264 --> 36:23.851
[ringtone]

36:27.312 --> 36:31.275
[ringtone]

36:34.653 --> 36:38.240
[ringtone]

36:41.743 --> 36:45.330
[ringtone]

36:56.508 --> 36:57.509
Stranger.

36:58.844 --> 36:59.845
Oh, hello.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.181
May I join you?

37:11.273 --> 37:12.274
Quiet today.

37:13.567 --> 37:14.693
I'm quiet most days.

37:15.319 --> 37:16.570
So the girl I met before,

37:16.904 --> 37:17.905
when's she around?

37:18.197 --> 37:19.698
Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Because I can come back.

37:21.325 --> 37:24.494
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
And every other Monday.

37:24.953 --> 37:25.954
I'll make a note.

37:26.747 --> 37:28.415
What is it you do,
that you can hang out

37:28.498 --> 37:30.959
- in coffee shops all day?
- I could ask you the same thing.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.505
I'm a software engineer. You?

37:35.380 --> 37:36.381
Unemployed.

37:37.257 --> 37:38.842
I used to help run an NGO.

37:38.967 --> 37:40.677
Well, actually,
I might do that again.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.430
Until then
I've been living off my savings,

37:43.514 --> 37:44.932
which are dwindling.

37:45.682 --> 37:46.683
And the art?

37:48.352 --> 37:50.646
I think that's going to
have to become a hobby.

37:51.063 --> 37:53.232
I feel that it could
be more than that for you.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.401
Not a job. More like a calling.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.823
That's really sweet
but you don't know me that well.

38:02.491 --> 38:04.034
I'm pretty good
at reading people.

38:05.077 --> 38:06.828
I see things.

38:07.287 --> 38:08.997
Okay, Svengali.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.250
What do you see?

38:14.586 --> 38:15.587
I see...

38:17.089 --> 38:19.591
I see a young woman who's torn.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.553
Her art makes her happy.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.514
Maybe happier
than anything else in the world.

38:25.848 --> 38:28.016
But she feels guilty about that.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.644
She feels guilty because...

38:31.728 --> 38:34.356
when she sees all the pain
and the suffering in the world

38:34.606 --> 38:37.442
her art feels trivial
compared to that.

38:39.653 --> 38:41.989
I see someone who sometimes

38:42.239 --> 38:46.285
whispers when something
moves her deeply because...

38:46.869 --> 38:48.453
she knows that words can't

38:48.537 --> 38:50.581
hold the bigness
of a moment like that

38:50.664 --> 38:51.665
But they can shrink it...

38:52.583 --> 38:53.625
make it disappear.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.378
And even when
the greatest sadness

38:56.461 --> 38:59.173
she'll ever know
settles on her shoulders...

38:59.923 --> 39:03.427
there's something beautiful
that just... shines through.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.554
That same fire of compassion

39:05.637 --> 39:07.848
that she's stoked
and nurtured her whole life.

39:08.932 --> 39:10.100
And she's...

39:11.518 --> 39:12.519
radiant.

39:25.741 --> 39:27.659
I'm just taking
a moment to be grateful.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.086
Thank you.

39:39.379 --> 39:40.380
That was...

39:42.174 --> 39:43.342
I call 'em like I see 'em.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.640
Do you want to have a drink
with me tonight?

39:52.184 --> 39:53.185
I have this friend.

39:54.645 --> 39:56.647
I know that I don't know you
that well, but...

39:57.439 --> 39:59.358
I feel like you and her
would really hit it off.

39:59.775 --> 40:00.776
Sure.

40:01.902 --> 40:02.903
Sounds great.

40:03.403 --> 40:05.197
Good... good.

40:07.199 --> 40:08.200
Excellent.

40:16.959 --> 40:18.752
[Joel] Hey,
I've got some friends inside.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.921
Do you mind
if I go in and join them?

40:21.713 --> 40:22.714
We're at full capacity.

40:36.353 --> 40:37.354
Thank you.

40:37.980 --> 40:39.022
Oh... Joel!

40:40.148 --> 40:41.149
- [Joel] Oh, hey.
- Hey.

40:42.484 --> 40:43.652
This is Mackenzie.

40:43.902 --> 40:45.821
Hi. Nice to meet you.

40:45.904 --> 40:46.905
You, too.

40:47.739 --> 40:50.075
[Aria] Okay,
so it's standing room only.

40:50.450 --> 40:53.704
Hour to an hour and a half
for a table, so...

40:54.079 --> 40:56.290
[Joel] Let's go somewhere else.
Where to?

40:58.458 --> 41:00.794
How about some place
with a nice bottle of wine?

41:02.129 --> 41:04.381
There's a little wine bar
a little further down Oceanview.

41:04.590 --> 41:07.134
I haven't been,
but I hear it's pretty good.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.553
How about your place?

41:12.681 --> 41:14.057
Are either of you hungry?

41:16.226 --> 41:17.311
I'm starving.

41:18.729 --> 41:19.730
All right. Let's go.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.279
[Joel] Gracias.

41:28.655 --> 41:31.366
[indistinct conversation]

41:31.867 --> 41:36.330
Okay. The second best burrito
you'll ever have.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.581
What's the first?

41:40.125 --> 41:41.502
I haven't found it yet.

41:41.585 --> 41:42.586
[laughs]

41:42.669 --> 41:44.004
[Mackenzie] Hey!

41:44.087 --> 41:47.382
Do you have any experience
with Augmented Reality?

41:48.300 --> 41:50.552
[Mackenzie laughs] What?
He's an engineer.

41:50.636 --> 41:52.346
Do you know how hard it is
to find a good one?

41:53.305 --> 41:55.098
It's like roping a unicorn.
[laughs]

41:55.182 --> 41:58.936
[Joel] No, the work I do
is more esoteric I suppose.

41:59.937 --> 42:00.938
I...

42:01.897 --> 42:03.524
I create models that...

42:04.691 --> 42:06.985
they try
to determine probabilities

42:07.236 --> 42:09.446
in chaotic complex systems.

42:09.988 --> 42:11.198
Sounds like a hoot.

42:11.323 --> 42:13.075
[both laughing]

42:13.158 --> 42:15.911
[Joel] For example,
what's the probability

42:15.994 --> 42:17.579
of Aria spitting her burrito

42:17.663 --> 42:19.623
- all over the parking lot.
- [Mackenzie laughs] Wow!

42:19.957 --> 42:21.166
That was impressive, by the way.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.584
I'm sorry.

42:22.876 --> 42:23.877
What were the...

42:25.546 --> 42:27.548
What were the forces and events

42:27.798 --> 42:29.508
that conspired
to make that happen?

42:29.800 --> 42:31.635
Easy. Bad breeding.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.763
She does that shit
at least once a day.

42:35.222 --> 42:36.348
[Mackenzie]
You're disgusting.

42:36.682 --> 42:37.683
- [laughs]
- [Aria] Okay,

42:38.141 --> 42:40.018
but seriously,
so something like...

42:40.602 --> 42:41.603
chaos theory.

42:42.479 --> 42:45.732
Where a butterfly
flaps its wings in Beijing,

42:45.816 --> 42:47.317
which then causes a girl

42:47.401 --> 42:50.028
to spit up her burrito
in Los Angeles.

42:50.237 --> 42:52.781
- Right? That kind of complexity?
- [Joel] Exactly that.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.491
So, what are you trying

42:54.575 --> 42:56.660
to figure out
with these probabilities?

42:56.785 --> 42:58.829
Well, let's use this burrito
as our context.

43:00.414 --> 43:02.291
There's a whole lot
going on inside this burrito,

43:02.708 --> 43:03.709
but at the end of the day

43:04.251 --> 43:06.128
there are a finite number
of variables at play here.

43:06.211 --> 43:07.921
What did you order?
Because I just got chicken.

43:08.046 --> 43:09.840
- [all laugh]
- Stay with me here.

43:10.549 --> 43:13.594
Let's just simplify things
and say the contents are just

43:13.802 --> 43:15.137
the rice, the beans,

43:15.512 --> 43:16.889
and maybe
a little bit of hot sauce.

43:18.348 --> 43:19.808
Now, when the burrito's made,

43:20.809 --> 43:23.061
the way the ingredients
combine inside,

43:23.353 --> 43:24.855
well that's totally random,
right?

43:25.564 --> 43:26.565
Uh-huh.

43:28.567 --> 43:29.568
What if it's not.

43:30.402 --> 43:33.363
If we could
understand exactly why

43:33.447 --> 43:35.991
the ingredients
combine the way they do,

43:36.491 --> 43:40.037
we could make this burrito
over and over again.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.622
And every time we made it,

43:42.456 --> 43:43.790
every grain of rice...

43:44.499 --> 43:45.542
every single bean...

43:46.084 --> 43:47.377
and every bit of hot sauce

43:47.461 --> 43:49.046
would be
in the exact same place.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.175
[Mackenzie]
I'm detecting a pattern.

43:54.426 --> 43:55.427
Order.

43:56.178 --> 43:57.679
Everything in its place.

43:58.764 --> 44:01.767
You are a live by the rules
type of guy.

44:01.892 --> 44:03.018
Yes, I used to be.

44:04.186 --> 44:05.187
Like my whole life.

44:05.896 --> 44:08.941
But now... trying something new.

44:09.483 --> 44:10.484
[Aria] Okay,

44:10.859 --> 44:13.070
so besides being a recovering

44:14.071 --> 44:15.531
follow the rules guy,

44:16.114 --> 44:18.617
why does it matter if the rice
falls in the same place?

44:20.285 --> 44:22.246
Well,
if you could replicate an event

44:22.329 --> 44:24.248
so it happens
the same way every time

44:24.414 --> 44:25.541
You'd be obsessive.

44:25.916 --> 44:28.043
[Joel] True, but also...

44:28.126 --> 44:30.379
[Aria]
You could predict anything.

44:32.589 --> 44:35.717
Yes. The weather. The future.

44:36.468 --> 44:39.471
Earthquakes.
Reconstruct the past.

44:40.138 --> 44:41.223
A perfect moment.

44:42.224 --> 44:45.060
But you wouldn't just
be remembering that moment,

44:45.769 --> 44:46.979
you'd be reliving it.

44:52.359 --> 44:54.987
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

44:56.446 --> 44:59.908
I don't think I would
want to relive a moment.

45:00.784 --> 45:02.035
No matter how perfect it was.

45:03.245 --> 45:04.246
[Aria] No,

45:04.663 --> 45:09.585
I want to create new memories,
new experiences, you know?

45:09.960 --> 45:11.420
Even if they're not as magical.

45:14.756 --> 45:15.757
[Mackenzie] Have you done it?

45:17.009 --> 45:19.261
Made the same thing happen
over and over?

45:22.222 --> 45:23.223
Not yet.

45:24.183 --> 45:28.604
Well, I think that this
conversation would go great...

45:29.188 --> 45:30.689
with a nice bottle of wine.

45:32.149 --> 45:33.692
You do have wine at your place,
right?

45:34.318 --> 45:35.319
I do.

45:36.820 --> 45:40.157
[harsh note]

45:40.490 --> 45:42.201
This is the right house,
isn't it?

45:43.493 --> 45:44.494
[groans]

45:45.245 --> 45:46.246
What's going on with you?

45:49.917 --> 45:51.793
I keep hearing these sounds.

45:51.919 --> 45:53.795
Then everything shakes.

45:54.588 --> 45:56.840
- [groans]
- It's probably a brain tumor.

45:57.716 --> 45:59.927
- Thanks.
- I'm sure it's real small.

46:00.010 --> 46:01.011
[laughs quietly]

46:06.600 --> 46:10.312
[harsh note plays repeatedly]

46:11.522 --> 46:12.523
[doorbell chimes]

46:16.610 --> 46:18.487
Ladies. Welcome.

46:21.281 --> 46:22.533
Gas station snacks.

46:22.866 --> 46:23.867
Because we're classy like that.

46:25.035 --> 46:28.205
- [laughs]
- Thank you. Please have a seat.

46:35.254 --> 46:36.255
Crazy.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.757
Yeah,
I got it when I was in Africa.

46:39.007 --> 46:40.467
Where in Africa?

46:40.551 --> 46:43.846
Western, mostly.
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togo.

46:44.555 --> 46:46.682
I spent a couple months there.
Between undergrad and grad.

46:47.599 --> 46:49.309
There's actually an interesting
bit of folklore

46:49.393 --> 46:50.435
that goes with it.

46:51.687 --> 46:54.064
Whoever has possession
of that mask

46:54.147 --> 46:56.233
will have the power
to come back from the dead.

46:56.733 --> 46:59.570
[laughs] UFOs. Bigfoot.

46:59.903 --> 47:01.530
Like I said, I'm a sucker.

47:01.780 --> 47:03.824
So, does that work?

47:04.700 --> 47:05.826
Because I could market it.

47:06.159 --> 47:07.828
- I'll let you know.
- Wait.

47:07.911 --> 47:11.665
Do you know you're resurrected
or forget everything?

47:11.748 --> 47:12.833
Like a zombie.

47:12.916 --> 47:14.084
Great question.

47:14.251 --> 47:16.086
I'll go check the user manual.

47:17.296 --> 47:21.049
Oh. There is one drawback
to coming back from the grave.

47:21.592 --> 47:23.719
You come back without a face.

47:24.303 --> 47:26.096
The mask takes it from you.

47:26.221 --> 47:27.389
[Aria laughs]

47:27.472 --> 47:30.893
Depending on the person,
it could be a benefit.

47:32.060 --> 47:34.521
- Like for you.
- Oh, it's like that is it?

47:34.897 --> 47:37.065
[mysterious music]

47:38.609 --> 47:41.153
So, I've got
a pretty decent Cab.

47:41.570 --> 47:45.908
An okay Zin, and a
Malbec I haven't tried yet.

47:46.992 --> 47:48.744
I'm good with the Cab.

47:49.369 --> 47:50.370
Aria?

47:51.038 --> 47:52.664
[Mackenzie] Hey. Rude.

47:52.831 --> 47:53.999
Put the phone away.

47:54.917 --> 47:57.544
I swear it's like it's
been glued to her hand.

47:57.628 --> 48:01.006
Weird because usually you
have to remind her she has one.

48:01.715 --> 48:05.010
Thomas was supposed to call me
when he landed last night.

48:05.969 --> 48:06.970
Excuse me.

48:15.729 --> 48:17.481
I'm gonna turn on some music.

48:17.564 --> 48:18.857
Give me a second here.

48:19.650 --> 48:20.651
[loud jazz music]

48:20.734 --> 48:22.778
[Joel] Oh. Sorry.
That's a bit loud.

48:23.987 --> 48:25.155
I'll be right back.

48:26.823 --> 48:29.201
[experimental jazz music]

48:37.251 --> 48:40.254
[Mackenzie laughing]
What? You have a body in there?

48:40.379 --> 48:44.091
In there? No, no.
I bury my bodies in the desert.

48:44.299 --> 48:45.968
- Oh.
- Much cleaner.

48:46.051 --> 48:47.052
[Joel chuckles]

48:47.678 --> 48:49.972
Just give me
two seconds to clean up.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.307
I'll give you both
a tour in a minute.

48:53.267 --> 48:58.272
How about you save
that tour for later?

49:02.192 --> 49:04.111
[experimental jazz continues]

49:07.155 --> 49:09.616
[phone rings]

49:17.457 --> 49:19.585
Look, I'm sure
there's a good reason.

49:20.586 --> 49:22.087
I'm sure he's fine.

49:33.390 --> 49:36.518
[experimental jazz
in the background]

49:45.444 --> 49:46.445
[pouring wine]

49:46.528 --> 49:48.322
So, to what should we toast?

49:50.157 --> 49:51.283
To breaking rules.

49:51.909 --> 49:53.202
To breaking the rules.

49:54.369 --> 49:55.787
- [glasses clink]
- Cheers.

49:55.871 --> 49:56.872
Cheers.

49:57.873 --> 49:59.625
[suspenseful music]

50:00.626 --> 50:04.087
[Mackenzie] I've read these
books since I was a little girl.

50:04.338 --> 50:10.677
And it's always been Berenstein,
E-I-N. Not Berenstain, A-I-N.

50:11.053 --> 50:14.306
What ethnicity is that anyway?
Is that even a real name.

50:14.389 --> 50:16.391
You two are perfect
for each other.

50:16.475 --> 50:17.935
- [Mackenzie laughs]
- OK.

50:18.185 --> 50:19.269
Snow White.

50:19.728 --> 50:22.564
The queen looks
in the mirror and says...

50:22.689 --> 50:24.316
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.

50:24.566 --> 50:25.567
Yes.

50:25.734 --> 50:26.735
No.

50:26.902 --> 50:29.696
She says
"Magic Mirror on the wall."

50:29.780 --> 50:30.781
What?

50:30.864 --> 50:31.865
- Uh uh.
- Bullshit.

50:31.949 --> 50:33.784
- Look it up.
- I will, right now.

50:34.618 --> 50:36.828
OK. Speaking of walls,

50:36.912 --> 50:38.622
- I have hit one.
- What?

50:38.997 --> 50:39.998
[Mackenzie] No.

50:41.542 --> 50:42.543
Stay.

50:43.877 --> 50:46.672
[singing]
Just a little bit longer.

50:47.464 --> 50:48.465
- No.
- [both laugh]

50:48.549 --> 50:51.677
All right, this Sleeping Beauty
needs to get her rest.

50:51.885 --> 50:53.595
Do you like what I did there?

50:53.679 --> 50:55.722
Oh. How topical.

50:56.181 --> 50:57.474
Are you okay to drive?

50:57.558 --> 50:59.768
I've been nursing
that glass all night.

50:59.852 --> 51:00.853
You're right.

51:00.936 --> 51:03.689
I got a lot of work
to do in the morning.

51:04.565 --> 51:05.566
Uh uh.

51:06.108 --> 51:08.652
One more glass
and then you walk me home.

51:10.946 --> 51:12.406
Good night, guys.

51:12.489 --> 51:14.449
[Mackenzie]
I'll see you in a bit.

51:25.586 --> 51:28.589
[eerie noises]

51:38.765 --> 51:41.476
[loud disturbing music]

51:56.700 --> 51:57.701
[Mackenzie] So.

51:58.243 --> 51:59.244
About that tour.

51:59.328 --> 52:02.706
Generally, tour hours are
Monday to Friday, nine to six.

52:03.332 --> 52:04.374
Damn.

52:04.499 --> 52:06.919
That means
I have to wait until next week.

52:08.170 --> 52:09.213
Or...

52:10.380 --> 52:12.132
we can make an exception.

52:12.508 --> 52:13.509
Sorry.

52:13.592 --> 52:14.718
Rules are rules.

52:16.178 --> 52:19.306
Didn't we just toast to breaking
a few of those?

52:19.640 --> 52:22.017
[soft jazz music]

52:40.494 --> 52:42.079
There's somebody else.

52:42.162 --> 52:43.413
[Mackenzie chuckles]

52:47.751 --> 52:49.127
Is she your wife?

52:52.506 --> 52:53.715
Your girlfriend?

52:55.968 --> 52:59.096
Somebody I've been interested in
for a very long time.

53:01.473 --> 53:02.474
Mhm.

53:06.311 --> 53:08.188
I don't think we have a problem.

53:09.523 --> 53:11.233
[kissing]

53:21.076 --> 53:23.161
[shower water running]

53:41.263 --> 53:42.723
[Mackenzie] Good morning.

53:44.808 --> 53:45.809
Morning.

53:58.155 --> 53:59.615
Neat is good.

54:09.416 --> 54:11.627
[Mackenzie]
Do you feel like breakfast?

54:12.085 --> 54:13.128
Absolutely.

54:14.463 --> 54:16.298
[door sliding]

54:28.060 --> 54:29.770
I had a good time last night.

54:30.521 --> 54:31.522
Me too.

54:37.444 --> 54:39.863
[water falling]

55:08.725 --> 55:12.896
[eerie piano music]

55:26.410 --> 55:29.288
[screeching violin music]

55:31.582 --> 55:32.624
Mackenzie.

55:46.305 --> 55:47.306
[loud thud]

55:47.764 --> 55:50.642
Jeez. You scared
the bejesus out of me!

55:54.688 --> 55:55.689
Are these yours?

55:56.106 --> 55:58.400
Yeah. Did I leave
them in the bathroom?

55:59.193 --> 56:00.360
Joel had them.

56:00.986 --> 56:04.072
In a drawer. With a picture
of you, thorn in half.

56:04.156 --> 56:05.824
He's your stalker! Joel...

56:05.908 --> 56:08.952
whatever the fuck his last
name is! I slept with him!

56:09.036 --> 56:10.287
Wait.

56:10.370 --> 56:13.749
- He didn't hurt you, did he?
- No. God, no.

56:15.125 --> 56:18.462
Actually, he wasn't
even into it at first.

56:18.545 --> 56:20.714
He kept going on about
this woman.

56:20.797 --> 56:21.965
Turns out it's you!

56:22.925 --> 56:23.926
Fuck!

56:24.301 --> 56:25.302
Okay.

56:26.011 --> 56:27.054
Breathe.

56:27.596 --> 56:28.597
Breathe.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.059
You're okay and I'm okay.

56:38.899 --> 56:41.527
I don't care
if we don't have proof.

56:41.944 --> 56:43.612
And if they don't believe us

56:43.695 --> 56:45.656
but we're going
back to the cops.

56:46.865 --> 56:47.866
Okay.

56:51.328 --> 56:52.871
[soft crying]

56:56.583 --> 56:57.584
Forgive me.

57:00.504 --> 57:01.505
[doorbell rings]

57:04.424 --> 57:05.592
[exhales deeply]

57:15.602 --> 57:16.645
[doorbell rings]

57:17.771 --> 57:18.772
I'm coming.

57:21.692 --> 57:23.402
[voices coming from outside]

57:27.990 --> 57:28.991
Afternoon.

57:29.575 --> 57:31.201
I'm looking for Joel Keller.

57:31.285 --> 57:32.286
That's me.

57:32.369 --> 57:34.746
Great. I have a few questions.

57:34.913 --> 57:38.333
Do you know an Aria Bauer?

57:38.542 --> 57:39.543
Aria?

57:39.626 --> 57:42.546
She was here last night
with her friend, Mackenzie.

57:43.130 --> 57:44.882
Where did you meet Miss Bauer?

57:45.132 --> 57:47.384
I met her at the market
on Honolulu.

57:47.467 --> 57:48.635
A little while back.

57:48.802 --> 57:51.013
I see. Yeah.
She said the same thing.

57:51.096 --> 57:53.015
[chuckling] Okay.

57:54.349 --> 57:55.851
Is there something funny?

57:56.643 --> 57:58.353
No. Just...

57:59.021 --> 58:00.272
Is there a problem?

58:02.357 --> 58:05.527
You mind if I come in?
I mean, it's a furnace out here.

58:08.197 --> 58:09.198
Sure.

58:12.409 --> 58:14.703
[suspenseful music]

58:14.912 --> 58:18.081
[dialling tone]

58:22.878 --> 58:26.256
[voicemail] Your call has been
forwarded to an automated...

58:27.382 --> 58:28.425
What if...

58:30.719 --> 58:32.429
You don't think Joel would...

58:35.474 --> 58:36.475
[locks door]

58:36.767 --> 58:39.520
- [Joel] Would you like a drink?
- [officer] Yeah.

58:39.603 --> 58:40.979
A water would be great.

58:42.439 --> 58:43.440
So...

58:43.899 --> 58:45.817
how did you meet
Miss Bauer again?

58:45.901 --> 58:48.904
Like I said,
I met her at the market.

58:49.154 --> 58:51.114
Right. You did say that.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.241
[whistles]

58:52.324 --> 58:54.660
This is a nice place.

58:55.452 --> 58:56.620
You were decorating?

58:57.788 --> 58:58.789
Cleaning.

59:01.208 --> 59:02.876
She is something, isn't she?

59:03.001 --> 59:04.002
Miss Bauer.

59:04.378 --> 59:08.298
I mean, she is
beautiful and intelligent.

59:08.757 --> 59:10.175
Absolutely charming.

59:11.218 --> 59:13.262
Oh my God, is she charming, huh?

59:13.345 --> 59:15.472
Is this leading
somewhere, Officer?

59:15.931 --> 59:18.100
Because I have work to do.

59:18.183 --> 59:19.518
Oh, you work from home?

59:19.810 --> 59:20.811
Yup.

59:20.894 --> 59:22.604
Let me guess, you are a...

59:22.688 --> 59:23.772
Software engineer.

59:23.939 --> 59:25.941
Huh. Would never
have guessed that.

59:26.775 --> 59:27.776
Me?

59:27.943 --> 59:28.944
I'm a cop.

59:29.027 --> 59:30.028
[laughs]

59:31.613 --> 59:35.534
I'm just shooting the shit cause
it is a scorcher out there.

59:35.826 --> 59:38.161
And in here it's
just nice and cool.

59:38.495 --> 59:40.038
Refreshing, you know?

59:41.206 --> 59:42.666
Mind if I take a look?

59:42.958 --> 59:45.210
- I'm a big fan of the arts.
- Know what?

59:45.294 --> 59:48.797
I'd rather you didn't.
It's one of mine.

59:48.881 --> 59:49.923
It's a painting.

59:50.340 --> 59:53.260
And I tried to get it right,
over and over...

59:53.343 --> 59:56.138
Isn't that like the definition
of insanity?

59:56.346 --> 59:58.473
When you try something
over and over

59:58.557 --> 01:00:00.893
and you expect
to get a different result?

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:06.732
- Isn't it one of these?
- Yes.

01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:08.192
One of these.

01:00:09.943 --> 01:00:10.944
Okay, no.

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:13.614
- [keys jingle]
- [Aria] Okay.

01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:18.660
[officer] My wife is just
like you. She loves photography.

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:21.622
And she was not good
at it at first.

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:24.166
But then she just
kept on practicing

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:28.086
and she developed an interesting
way of looking at things.

01:00:29.129 --> 01:00:31.215
She developed a good eye.

01:00:31.298 --> 01:00:34.092
See, she can just look at things

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.678
the way other people...

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:39.723
don't.

01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:41.600
[suspenseful music]

01:00:45.229 --> 01:00:47.105
It's okay. I get it.

01:00:47.189 --> 01:00:48.440
You're embarrassed.

01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:51.026
But I am a good critic,
you can ask my wife.

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:53.487
I will.
Next time I see her.

01:00:54.279 --> 01:00:55.280
[chuckles]

01:00:56.323 --> 01:00:58.534
[suspenseful music continues]

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:00.118
[Aria] Thomas?

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.462
Here's the thing, Mr Keller.

01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:11.964
In my line of work

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:15.634
I deal with attention
seekers all the time.

01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:17.719
Old, young, male and female.

01:01:18.136 --> 01:01:22.057
You see, Miss Bauer,
she's not an attention seeker.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.267
So I'm thinking

01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:26.353
that maybe you're thinking...

01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:29.439
you and her together.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.027
That's not gonna happen.

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:40.117
Hm. I should get going.

01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:41.910
Have a good afternoon.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:47.332
[officer] Oh, and...

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:49.168
that hobby of yours.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.503
I'd try something new.

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.631
[knife flicks]

01:01:56.633 --> 01:01:58.677
[suspenseful music crescendo]

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:00.304
Thomas?

01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:05.142
[stabbing]

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:09.479
[screams]

01:02:09.563 --> 01:02:11.398
[screaming]

01:02:12.608 --> 01:02:13.775
[stabs]

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:17.154
[laughs]

01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:19.573
- [dramatic music]
- [sobbing]

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:26.663
[gun clicks]

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.418
[shots]

01:02:33.754 --> 01:02:35.380
[heavy breathing]

01:02:36.798 --> 01:02:38.175
[officer] Officer down.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:42.429
Twenty two,
eighty four, Rosemont.

01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:43.972
[breathing heavily]

01:02:44.223 --> 01:02:46.308
[eerie music]

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.102
[whispering]

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:51.230
[officer panting]

01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:54.107
[suspenseful music]

01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:56.902
[Mackenzie] Shit.

01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.987
[Aria screaming]

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:02.574
[disturbing music]

01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.499
[eerie music]

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:17.464
That bad?

01:03:20.342 --> 01:03:21.343
[Mackenzie] Okay.

01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:25.055
We're gonna find you a doctor
in one of these podunk towns and

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:28.058
get him to give you something
for that headache.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:32.354
Or...

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:33.814
maybe...

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:36.525
we hit a motel.

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:38.986
We get drunk.
We order some Chinese food

01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:41.321
and watch some shitty tv.

01:03:44.074 --> 01:03:45.075
Come on.

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.661
What part of that
doesn't sound awesome?

01:03:55.878 --> 01:03:57.921
[eerie music]

01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:02.843
[disturbing music]

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:04.720
[panting] Mackenzie!

01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:06.221
Mackenzie!

01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:08.307
Aria, what the hell?

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:10.601
[disturbing music]

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.232
There was...

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:21.195
Come here.

01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:22.487
Come here.

01:04:25.866 --> 01:04:26.867
Come on.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:29.828
[Aria breathing heavily]

01:04:31.455 --> 01:04:32.456
You're okay.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:37.377
It didn't have a face.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.171
It's just a dream.

01:04:41.173 --> 01:04:42.466
It's just a dream.

01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:50.974
[Aria] He's out there, Mack.

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:52.184
Somewhere.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:57.606
What if he knows where we are
and where we're going?

01:04:58.482 --> 01:04:59.483
How?

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.277
He'd have to be
fucking omniscient.

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:04.738
And he's probably dead.

01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:06.573
Rotting somewhere in a ditch.

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:10.536
You read the report.

01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:12.913
The cop shot him three times.

01:05:13.247 --> 01:05:14.581
The neighbors heard it.

01:05:14.665 --> 01:05:18.043
They didn't find any bullet
holes in the walls or ceiling.

01:05:19.962 --> 01:05:21.004
Do the math.

01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:27.177
I need some water.

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:29.429
- Can you get me one?
- Sure.

01:05:30.764 --> 01:05:33.767
[eerie music]

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:36.979
It's not real.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.022
It's not real.

01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:41.650
[disturbing music]

01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:44.987
What?

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:47.823
[breathing deeply]

01:05:51.785 --> 01:05:52.786
Uh...

01:05:54.705 --> 01:05:55.706
Nothing.

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:10.429
- [Mackenzie] Ready?
- [Aria] Yeah.

01:06:10.512 --> 01:06:11.680
[soft piano music]

01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:13.682
- [Aria gasps]
- [Mackenzie giggles]

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.350
[Aria] Wow.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.936
[Mackenzie] I told you.

01:06:21.773 --> 01:06:22.774
[Mackenzie] What?

01:06:24.693 --> 01:06:26.904
Those are the flowers
Thomas bought me.

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:29.907
Just hold on.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:34.077
[piano music continues]

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:39.458
What does it say?

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:43.128
It's a welcome card.

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:46.882
With a number on the back
if we have maintenance concerns.

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.847
We'll just put these outside.

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:57.392
Okay.

01:07:07.986 --> 01:07:11.740
So I was wondering if
the offer's still on the table.

01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:14.034
Are you kidding?

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:17.204
I know. I know, I messed up.
Forget about it.

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:20.040
Who are you right now?

01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:21.750
Yes.

01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:24.169
- Really?
- Of course it is.

01:07:24.253 --> 01:07:25.963
- Okay.
- And even if it wasn't,

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:28.590
it will take me
two seconds to convince Ben.

01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:30.300
[Aria chuckles]

01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:34.596
Okay, so there's a little
junior high drama here and there

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.432
but it's a great place to work.

01:07:37.683 --> 01:07:40.394
Yeah? And you'll
introduce me to the cool kids?

01:07:40.519 --> 01:07:41.520
Of course.

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:43.939
You're gonna love them.

01:07:44.106 --> 01:07:45.691
Cause they're so rad.

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:47.317
So rad.

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:48.735
[Mackenzie laughs]

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.572
- God, it's hot.
- It's a little hot.

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:53.031
- Want some water?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.115 --> 01:07:54.116
[Mackenzie gasps]

01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:55.200
[Aria laughs]

01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:56.285
You're so dead.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:15.888
I just keep going over it
again and again in my head.

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:20.975
If I just wouldn't have talked
to that psycho at the market.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.194
If I just wouldn't have talked
to that guy at the market.

01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:35.657
Thomas would still be alive.

01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:37.533
[dramatic music]

01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:40.537
Hey.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.332
[takes a deep breath]

01:08:44.249 --> 01:08:45.250
Hey.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.002
We already talked about this.

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:50.881
- [Aria sniffles]
- It's not on you.

01:08:58.388 --> 01:09:00.515
How do you go on, Mack?

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:06.188
How do you keep going
after something like this?

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:12.611
And you know that nothing
will ever be normal or the same.

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:18.992
[sniffling]

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.461
[Aria] Well,
it's an explanation.

01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:31.421
[Mackenzie] That's superstition.

01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:33.340
There's many ways to explain it.

01:09:33.799 --> 01:09:36.676
You've been stressed.
Your whole life has changed.

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:39.429
Your mind is trying
to make sense of it.

01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:43.225
He said any person
who owns that mask

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:45.519
comes back without a face.

01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:48.020
- What did I see?
- Power of suggestion.

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:50.357
He said it
and it's stuck in your mind.

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:52.317
It's as simple as that.

01:09:56.446 --> 01:10:00.242
[mysterious music]

01:10:22.139 --> 01:10:24.933
[panting]

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:29.021
[eerie music]

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:36.361
[music crescendo]

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:43.994
Mackenzie, get up.

01:10:44.161 --> 01:10:45.954
Get up. Come on.

01:10:46.079 --> 01:10:47.289
Right now. Come on.

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:53.837
[music continues]

01:10:57.049 --> 01:10:58.050
[Mackenzie] Fuck.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.801
We're leaving.

01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:01.345
Right now.

01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:06.934
Do you see it?

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:10.062
[eerie music]

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:13.273
[thump]

01:11:24.618 --> 01:11:25.786
[figure] Be with me.

01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:29.206
[loud disturbing music]

01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:43.470
- What?
- The keys. I don't have them.

01:11:43.554 --> 01:11:44.596
Where are they?

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.474
Where are the keys?
I don't know.

01:11:47.558 --> 01:11:49.017
Mack! Where are the keys?

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:50.894
Fuck! I don't fucking know!

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:52.271
Okay, okay!

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.772
Okay.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.360
Shit. Wait!

01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:01.613
[suspenseful music]

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:16.962
[music continues]

01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:13.936
Fuck!

01:13:29.326 --> 01:13:32.788
[eerie music]

01:13:50.305 --> 01:13:52.933
[music continues]

01:14:25.716 --> 01:14:26.758
[Aria] Mackenzie!

01:14:26.925 --> 01:14:27.968
[Mackenzie] No!

01:14:42.357 --> 01:14:44.359
- [bone breaks]
- [Mackenzie screams]

01:14:47.154 --> 01:14:50.574
[Mackenzie screaming and crying]

01:15:03.378 --> 01:15:04.379
No!

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:06.548
- [Mackenzie screams]
- [loud thud]

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:12.888
[thud]

01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:31.490
[suspenseful music]

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:46.088
[action music]

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:53.762
[Aria screams]

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:12.948
[disturbing music]

01:16:18.245 --> 01:16:21.790
[action music]

01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:44.354
[mysterious music]

01:18:19.408 --> 01:18:20.409
[Thomas] Aria?

01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:22.536
Is that you?

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:25.080
[Aria] Thomas?

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.086
I missed you so much.

01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:33.422
Where did you go?

01:18:35.549 --> 01:18:36.550
See..

01:18:37.593 --> 01:18:39.553
This is all I ever wanted.

01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:41.805
To have this again.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.350
I'm not asking for the world.

01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:48.145
Just this.

01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:01.783
What the hell are you?

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:03.744
I'm human.

01:19:04.286 --> 01:19:05.329
Just like you.

01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:07.039
[dramatic music]

01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:08.248
No, you're not.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.752
You don't recognize me, do you?

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:15.422
Even though we've met
a thousand times.

01:19:16.757 --> 01:19:17.925
At times I feel like

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:21.512
there's a spark of recognition
but it's just a fluke.

01:19:23.138 --> 01:19:25.349
You don't actually remember.

01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:27.142
God, I wish you did.

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.520
[Aria breathing heavily]

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:30.771
Go ahead.

01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:32.564
There's no one out there.

01:19:33.774 --> 01:19:35.526
God damn, I love you.

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:38.111
You never give up. Ever.

01:19:38.654 --> 01:19:40.072
We're the same that way.

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:42.449
Only you want him.

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:44.701
And I want you.

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.079
I love you.

01:19:47.788 --> 01:19:48.956
I'll never love you.

01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:50.666
You did.

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.000
You did love me.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.461
[Aria gasps]

01:19:54.586 --> 01:19:56.213
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:20:00.217 --> 01:20:01.927
I want to show you something.

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:08.433
[soft piano music]

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:41.216
[music continues]

01:20:54.771 --> 01:20:57.691
[car horn]

01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:02.362
[dramatic music]

01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:08.368
We were happy.

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.332
And we almost were again.

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:15.918
We were so close, Aria.

01:21:16.084 --> 01:21:17.085
But...

01:21:18.378 --> 01:21:20.631
the flap of a butterfly's wings.

01:21:22.883 --> 01:21:27.387
I tried to salvage it
with some improvisation but

01:21:29.348 --> 01:21:32.184
it's chaotic, complex.

01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:35.979
[glass shatters]

01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:40.484
Simulation isn't really
the right word for it.

01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:42.653
Or virtual reality.

01:21:43.862 --> 01:21:45.447
Cause at the end of the day

01:21:47.032 --> 01:21:48.742
it's all just DNA.

01:21:49.826 --> 01:21:51.578
And DNA fundamentally is...

01:21:51.662 --> 01:21:52.663
Code.

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:57.751
[sniffling]

01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:00.295
None of this is real.

01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:01.380
[Joel] It is.

01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:03.882
Just not in the way
you're used to see it.

01:22:04.132 --> 01:22:06.426
[Aria breathing heavily]

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:09.137
I'm not real.

01:22:10.347 --> 01:22:11.765
[Joel] You make choices.

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:15.519
You have hopes, dreams.
You feel pain.

01:22:16.311 --> 01:22:17.312
Joy.

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:19.481
You're thoughts are your own.

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:21.900
You're kind.

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:24.361
And flawed.

01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:27.239
That's real.

01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:32.953
And you.

01:22:34.371 --> 01:22:35.789
You're code, too.

01:22:38.292 --> 01:22:40.210
In this world, yes.

01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:43.297
Outside...

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.381
Outside?

01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:47.759
You don't think
it's a version of this?

01:22:47.843 --> 01:22:48.844
[laughs]

01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:51.138
The girl I fell in love with.

01:22:53.015 --> 01:22:54.474
The girl you created.

01:22:55.142 --> 01:22:57.352
I wrote the code
that created you.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:00.981
I never could have imagined you.

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:03.442
[crying] Then rewrite me!

01:23:04.776 --> 01:23:07.571
Reprogram me to love you
if that's what you want!

01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:10.282
That wouldn't really
be love then, would it?

01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:13.285
Without choice
it's something different.

01:23:14.703 --> 01:23:16.413
Something ugly.

01:23:18.749 --> 01:23:19.750
[Joel] Now...

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.711
you have
a very real choice to make.

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.299
If you take this,
it will end your life

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:29.051
and we'll start over.

01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:32.846
Aria Bauer will exist again.

01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:35.557
but it won't really be you,
will it?

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:39.978
That variant of Aria
will be a whole new person.

01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:41.563
A clean slate.

01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:43.857
She won't remember.

01:23:43.941 --> 01:23:45.192
Just like you don't.

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:49.029
She won't remember
what happened here

01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:52.991
because the Aria Bauer standing
in front of me will be gone.

01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:56.370
A wave of heat.

01:23:57.538 --> 01:24:00.999
A million,
million particles of energy.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.086
[thump]

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:05.504
[balls clicking]

01:24:09.383 --> 01:24:10.634
Scattered.

01:24:16.056 --> 01:24:18.642
[Joel] Or you can try
something much simpler.

01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:24.356
You loved me once.

01:24:26.567 --> 01:24:27.818
Love me again.

01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.327
You say this is real.

01:24:40.163 --> 01:24:46.211
But what you did to my life
and to my friends were not real.

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:50.257
Not to you.

01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:54.469
You liked toying with us.

01:24:55.971 --> 01:24:57.181
Playing God.

01:24:59.183 --> 01:25:00.684
Breaking the rules.

01:25:02.019 --> 01:25:05.022
Making yourself seem strong.

01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:07.691
Smart.

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:10.777
That must have felt so good.

01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:13.197
Having all that power.

01:25:14.615 --> 01:25:15.949
And you're right.

01:25:16.909 --> 01:25:18.160
I do have a choice.

01:25:19.995 --> 01:25:22.206
A very real one.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:26.210
And I choose...

01:25:27.085 --> 01:25:29.379
anything but you.

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:34.510
Oh, you are the best you yet.

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.514
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:43.894
I'm not going anywhere.

01:25:44.686 --> 01:25:45.854
Motherfucker.

01:25:56.073 --> 01:25:58.158
[Joel panting]

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:08.752
[whispering]

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.802
[eerie music]

01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:20.514
[indiscernible computer voice]

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:33.694
[computer voice]

01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:24.369
Remember.

01:27:26.288 --> 01:27:27.289
Remember.

01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:30.626
Remember.

01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:36.423
Remember.

01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:40.302
Remember.

01:27:44.139 --> 01:27:45.140
Remember.

01:27:45.516 --> 01:27:48.393
[suspenseful music]

01:27:49.186 --> 01:27:50.187
Remember.

01:27:55.484 --> 01:27:57.528
[choking]

01:28:03.784 --> 01:28:05.911
[music crescendo]

01:28:08.664 --> 01:28:09.665
[music stops]

01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:21.343
[soft jazz music]

01:28:44.491 --> 01:28:45.492
Remember.
