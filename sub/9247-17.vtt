WEBVTT

00:03.786 --> 00:05.788
You really got to stay
like that for ten minutes

00:05.875 --> 00:07.137
in order to get pregnant?

00:07.224 --> 00:09.183
Supposedly it gets
the salmon spawning

00:09.270 --> 00:10.749
in the right direction.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.403
I can only do it
for eight minutes, though.

00:12.490 --> 00:15.667
I've got to shave
my legs before work.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.626
You don't have
to tell me, cactus calves.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.454
I got stubble burn on my back.

00:19.541 --> 00:23.849
Wow! The honeymoon
is officially over, isn't it?

00:23.936 --> 00:25.764
- Where are you going?
- To make some breakfast.

00:25.851 --> 00:29.029
I'll scramble my eggs
while you're fertilizing yours.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.683
No, sit down and talk
to me, these are your boys

00:31.770 --> 00:34.469
I'm giving a ride
on the water slide.

00:34.556 --> 00:37.298
Sweetie, you're ovulating
for the next 36 hours.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.561
That's a long time
in the car together.

00:39.648 --> 00:42.346
We can't stop
at every Stuckey's.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.913
- Stay.
- Fine.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.610
but just a warning,
I used up most of my

00:45.697 --> 00:47.438
witty banter during foreplay.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.179
So your idea
of witty banter and foreplay

00:49.266 --> 00:50.833
was kicking
your slippers off and saying

00:50.920 --> 00:53.575
okay, let's do this thing,
papa needs a paycheck.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.708
Hey, it got
your motor running, didn't it?

00:56.795 --> 00:59.059
Baby sex.
Ovulators can't be choosers.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.453
It'll all be worth it
when I see you holding

01:02.540 --> 01:04.847
our beautiful
young'un in your arms.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.503
You're gonna
be the greatest dad.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.114
And listen, I don't care
if we have a boy or a girl.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.073
Either way, they're
gonna be pitching for the cubs.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.380
Or dancing for the Joffrey.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.165
Long as they're
healthy and happy.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.864
And have your
cute little button nose.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.432
- I love you, Mike Biggs.
- I love you, Molly Flynn.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.217
[bell dinging]

01:27.304 --> 01:29.393
Alright, good talk.
I'll see you at 6:00.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.308
Don't be late.
I've got papers to grade.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.442
♪ For the first time ♪

01:34.529 --> 01:36.400
♪ In my life ♪

01:38.054 --> 01:40.317
♪ I see love ♪

01:55.332 --> 01:56.942
I'm telling you, man,
this St. Patty's Day

01:57.029 --> 01:58.814
is gonna be the best ever.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.163
Better than the year
you got drunk

02:00.250 --> 02:01.773
painted yourself
green and then tried

02:01.860 --> 02:04.298
to French kiss
the police horse?

02:04.385 --> 02:06.996
Hey, man, I was
feeding clip-clop a carrot.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.606
Hey, and those pictures
made that look a lot weirder

02:08.693 --> 02:10.086
than it really was.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.610
You took advantage
of a hungry horse, Carl.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.309
Neigh means neigh.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.093
Joke if you want,
but that's what St. Patty's Day

02:17.180 --> 02:19.356
is all about,
free-spirited revelry.

02:19.443 --> 02:22.664
- Some might say, unbridled.
- Aah.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
By the way, uh, are you two
seein' each other again

02:24.796 --> 02:26.189
or has she moved on
to greener pastures?

02:26.276 --> 02:29.061
Hm, oh, that reminds me,
I got to pick up a keg

02:29.149 --> 02:31.412
of green beer for my party,
and talk to my pinata guy

02:31.499 --> 02:33.109
to see if he can do
a leprechaun.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.111
Wow, you're really going all
out for this thing, aren't you?

02:35.198 --> 02:37.679
Hey, this is my first official
blow out in my new apartment.

02:37.766 --> 02:38.723
People are
gonna be talking about

02:38.810 --> 02:40.290
this soiree for years to come.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.118
Well, I'll have to read
about it in the papers

02:42.205 --> 02:44.468
or, next month's
Horse Quarterly.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.255
Wait, now you're not coming?

02:48.342 --> 02:49.952
But I already bought
enough bags of green M&Ms

02:50.039 --> 02:51.388
to dam up a levee.

02:51.475 --> 02:52.911
I was prepared
for Hurricane Mike.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.652
I'm sorry, Carl,
somethin' came up.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.263
No, but you've known
about this for two weeks

02:56.350 --> 02:58.090
and all of the sudden you ju..

02:58.178 --> 03:01.355
Oh, wait.
Molly's ovulating, isn't she?

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
And on St. Patty's Day.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.619
Funny how her eggs never drop

03:04.706 --> 03:08.362
when she's got tickets
to Mamma Mia!

03:08.449 --> 03:10.102
Why don't you just
do a hit and run?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.540
You guys are married,
she knows you're coming back.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.846
Ovulation days aren't just
one and done, Carl.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.022
It's a marathon,
by the time it's over

03:17.109 --> 03:20.417
I won't be able to form a
sentence or pull up my pants.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.680
Hey, this St. Patty's Day

03:22.767 --> 03:24.856
I'm gonna be
the exact same way.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.337
And that right there is
what made that horse picture

03:27.424 --> 03:29.296
really weird.

03:33.038 --> 03:37.042
"My ears have not
drunk a hundred words

03:37.129 --> 03:39.044
"of thy tongue's uttering

03:40.220 --> 03:41.960
"yet I know the sound.

03:42.047 --> 03:46.661
"Art thou not Romeo
a Mont-a-cue?

03:48.228 --> 03:52.667
Neither, fair saint,
if either thee dislike."

03:52.754 --> 03:55.191
Okay, what did we just say
to each other?

03:55.278 --> 03:57.324
You just asked
if I was Romeo, and I said

03:57.411 --> 03:59.326
Yeah,
unless it's a deal breaker.

03:59.413 --> 04:02.067
I don't understand
a word of it.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.765
It might
as well be in Mexican.

04:05.593 --> 04:09.510
Well, Elizabethan poetry
does sound pretty Mexican-y

04:09.597 --> 04:12.164
until you get used to it.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.124
I appreciate you helping me
with my homework, Harry.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.996
You know,
I'm not so much book smart

04:18.083 --> 04:20.912
as magazine smart.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.306
Don't sell yourself short,
you're an ethereal

04:23.393 --> 04:25.874
inquisitive soul
with a palpable effervescence.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.921
Okay, what'd you just say?

04:30.008 --> 04:32.489
- I said, you're pretty neat.
- Oh, thanks.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.013
You're neat too.

04:36.667 --> 04:40.802
"How cam'st thou hither,
tell me, and wherefore?

04:40.889 --> 04:44.458
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb--

04:44.545 --> 04:46.895
"And the place death,
considering who thou art

04:46.982 --> 04:49.506
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here."

04:51.465 --> 04:52.944
That's what
it says right here.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.164
How did you do that?

04:55.251 --> 04:56.426
Well, the..

04:56.513 --> 04:58.602
...balcony scene
from "Romeo and Juliet."

04:58.689 --> 05:01.213
I'm an English lit major
and...Shakespeare's

05:01.301 --> 05:03.477
kinda my thing.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.914
I have a test tomorrow
and if it wasn't for Harry

05:06.001 --> 05:09.483
here me thinks
I'd be screwed.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.660
Oh-ho,
so you're an aficionado

05:12.747 --> 05:14.488
of "The Bard", are you, huh?

05:14.575 --> 05:17.142
Well, I received his collected
works for my 12th birthday

05:17.229 --> 05:19.623
and read every volume,
cover to cover.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.843
Well...like I always
tell my students

05:21.930 --> 05:26.761
reading is one thing,
but understanding is another.

05:26.848 --> 05:30.460
I did understudy Mercutio
at the Shawnee Summer Theater.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.070
And I got
to perform one matinee

05:32.157 --> 05:34.421
when his eczema flared up.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.248
Have you ever played
any of the female roles?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.339
See, in Shakespeare's time
the men played all the roles.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.692
Harry told me, it's
like having an encyclopedia

05:44.779 --> 05:47.521
that breathes really loud.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.610
- Sorry. Deviated septum.
- Yeah.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.829
He got hit in the face
with a tire swing.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.441
Well, I'll leave you
in the hands of this

05:54.528 --> 05:56.791
self-proclaimed expert.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.575
For me and my Romeo
have plans

05:58.662 --> 06:02.405
to "Expend our spirit
in the waste of shame."

06:04.146 --> 06:06.104
Y-you do realize
that's from a Sonnet

06:06.191 --> 06:07.541
and not "Romeo and Juliet?"

06:07.628 --> 06:09.281
You do realize
this know it all stuff

06:09.369 --> 06:11.632
is why people hit you
in the face with a tire swing?

06:16.637 --> 06:17.899
Hey, where you been,
I was getting ready

06:17.986 --> 06:19.248
to start without ya.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.076
Sounds good to me.
I don't need the parade.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.905
Just bring me in
for the fireworks.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.733
By the way,
Carl's very disappointed

06:25.820 --> 06:26.951
we won't be at his party.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.736
Hey, I'm disappointed too.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.086
I used to roll pretty hard
on St. Patty's Day.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.393
Yeah, right,
a four pack of wine coolers

06:33.480 --> 06:34.742
in the teacher's lounge
followed by

06:34.829 --> 06:36.265
a Dirty Spelling Bee?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.136
Really?
Take a look at that.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.704
- What is it?
- St. Patty's Day, 2002.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.706
- What happened?
- Whiskey shots at the bar.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.752
Some drunk jackass
tried to grab a touch

06:44.839 --> 06:47.363
of the blarney and I
elbowed him in the mouth.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.931
- You're kidding!
- Scars don't lie, buddy.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.236
I actually kept his tooth
for a while.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.021
I wonder what I did with that.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.024
So, my wife
has been in a bar fight?

06:56.111 --> 06:57.852
Well, not much
of a fight, I hit him

06:57.939 --> 07:00.332
and he hit the ground.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.986
Why am I just
hearing about this?

07:02.073 --> 07:05.033
Hey, you don't need to hear
about every Tavern Brawl

07:05.120 --> 07:08.036
and which Chicago Bear
I've tongue wrestled with.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.472
What?

07:09.559 --> 07:11.082
That was the past,
this is the future.

07:11.169 --> 07:14.129
- Speaking of which, baby time.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.957
Did he play
offense or defense?

07:16.044 --> 07:18.612
Hmm, that night
he was playing offense.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.310
Who are you?

07:21.397 --> 07:23.051
I am the lady
having your baby.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.879
Let's go, mouth closed

07:24.966 --> 07:27.142
britches down.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.057
Yes, ma'am.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.015
Please tell me
it wasn't a place kicker.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.630
Man, I can't believe
this is all

07:36.717 --> 07:38.370
the dinnerware
this old woman has.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.894
How am I supposed
to throw a nice party

07:39.981 --> 07:42.113
with six plates and three
Flintstones cereal bowls?

07:44.507 --> 07:46.291
Are you sure your grandma
is alright with us

07:46.378 --> 07:47.728
borrowing all of her stuff?

07:47.815 --> 07:50.034
Hey, I am her grandson,
the light of her life.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.907
My happiness is her priority.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.778
Now run upstairs
and grab some towels and soap

07:54.865 --> 07:58.608
before that old buzzard
blows through that door.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.828
Hey, by the way, we are
out of toilet paper too.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.570
Man, how many times I gotta
tell you three sheets is plenty.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.920
Any more than that,
then you should take a shower.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.141
I know, Carl, I've read
the sign you've taped

08:10.228 --> 08:11.229
to the toilet tank.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.797
Don't just read it, do it.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.451
You left me stranded
so many times I almost

08:15.538 --> 08:17.018
had to wipe with the sign.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.935
It's like
living with an animal.

08:22.371 --> 08:25.461
We got gin,
cognac, tawny port.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.811
Damn, that old Baptist
parties like a gangsta rapper.

08:30.031 --> 08:33.121
Boy, if you robbing me,
you better put on a ski mask

08:33.208 --> 08:34.601
and duct tape me to a chair.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.821
Hey, Grandma, um

08:37.908 --> 08:39.867
where's that bottle of J&B
I gave you last Christmas?

08:39.954 --> 08:42.043
- It's gone.
- You drank that whole thing?

08:42.130 --> 08:44.349
It was half empty
when you gave it to me.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.615
Well, it was cold that night
and the heater broke in my car.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.051
Would you prefer
I freeze to death?

08:50.138 --> 08:51.922
It's not my first choice
for the way you die

08:52.009 --> 08:53.489
but it'll do.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.841
By the way, do you have
any nice cocktail glasses

08:57.928 --> 09:00.191
so that the people can enjoy
this cognac in style?

09:00.278 --> 09:02.106
How about I break
that bottle over your head

09:02.193 --> 09:04.195
and they can suck it
out of your ears?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.765
Fine. I don't need
this stuff anyway.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.985
An-and don't bother leaving
it to me in your will

09:11.072 --> 09:13.117
'cause it's all crap!

09:13.204 --> 09:15.424
You're gonna meet
your maker way before I do.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.992
And I got a list of ten ways
to make that happen.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.261
Hello, Nana.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.745
Uh, about these fancy soaps.
Do they contain paraffins?

09:31.832 --> 09:33.747
Because I have
very sensitive skin.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.100
So, Romeo thought
Juliet was dead

09:39.187 --> 09:41.058
and killed himself
but then she wakes up

09:41.145 --> 09:43.452
and sees he's dead
and kills herself?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.802
Well, when you're writing
a tragedy and you hit act five

09:45.889 --> 09:47.804
you gotta wrap things up
pretty quick.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.112
So sad.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.462
They killed
themselves for love.

in each other's arms

Well, I know
he's crazy about you.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.929

something really strange?

...when he's not here..

10:36.853 --> 10:38.289
...I remember feeling that way

10:38.376 --> 10:40.161
when I first met Molly.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.554
- I'd drop her off after a date.
- Mm-hm.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.123
And sit in the car just
starin' at the door, smiling.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.517
Imaginin' the next time
that I'd get to see her.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.955
That's so romantic.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.827

love feels like.

in simple geometry.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.258
A guy shaped like you

12:17.345 --> 12:19.826

shaped like that.

and applied yourself
