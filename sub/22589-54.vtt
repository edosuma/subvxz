we last left Batman sealed...</i>

00:14.307 --> 00:17.727

five feet under water.</i>

00:17.936 --> 00:23.358

01:49.485 --> 01:52.238
The die is cast, Tutlings.

01:52.447 --> 01:57.118
Never again will Batman poke
his bony beak into my business...

01:57.327 --> 02:00.038
...or anybody else's business
for that matter.

02:00.246 --> 02:04.083
Ah! Don't work yourself into a flap, spunky.

02:04.292 --> 02:10.548
He's drowned, not even
brat-to-bat resuscitation can help him now.

02:10.757 --> 02:14.093
Now I must get back to the throne room...

02:14.302 --> 02:19.349
...and see if my adored Cleopatra
has changed her mind in the dungeon.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.685
I still don't see
what that dame has that I don't.

02:22.894 --> 02:27.315
Well, whatever it is,
she's had it centuries longer than you.

02:27.523 --> 02:31.736
You've seen the last of that vatted calf.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.119
Morse Batcode?

02:47.585 --> 02:49.587
Good heavens.

02:56.636 --> 02:59.889
You're in big trouble, King Tut.

03:00.098 --> 03:06.813
Kidnapping, murder, grand theft
and malicious mischief.

03:07.021 --> 03:10.400
You're a party-pooper, Cleo.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.987
Now you see we've had our first spat.

03:16.072 --> 03:20.201
All right, fellows, gather up yon bird boy...

03:20.410 --> 03:23.204
...and bring the Tut Truck
round to the front entrance.

03:23.413 --> 03:26.749
We go now
to the royal oil boiling room.

03:26.958 --> 03:31.879
A perfect place
to make our nuptial arrangements.

03:32.046 --> 03:36.300
Ugh. Aren't going to be
any nuptial arrangements.

03:36.509 --> 03:37.719
I wanna go home.

03:37.927 --> 03:44.225
Oh, and so you shall,
my little lily of the valley of the kings.

03:44.434 --> 03:48.146
In gloriously triumphant splendor
to the Nile.

03:48.312 --> 03:53.276
My father hears about this, he's gonna
run you out of town on an Egyptian rail.

03:53.484 --> 03:58.072
Your father, dear Cleopatra,
lies immobile and in the grave...

03:58.281 --> 04:01.284
...in Rama, great city of the Sahara.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.745
When we get to the royal oil boiling room...

04:03.953 --> 04:10.626
...be sure to prepare some real boiling royal
boiling oil to boil the boy wonder in royally.

04:14.172 --> 04:15.798
Oh, sir.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.024
Oh, come on.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.318
Face it, Cleo.

04:35.526 --> 04:41.699
Fate has pushed us together
and no man can split us asunder.

04:41.908 --> 04:48.331
For the last time, I am not Cleopatra
and you certainly are not King Tut.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.999
Bite your tongue.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.627
She speaks heresy, omnipotent one.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.590
Lord Chancellor,
you don't understand women.

04:57.799 --> 05:01.761
Beneath it all,
she's aflame with love for me.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.596
Yuck.

05:03.763 --> 05:06.057
Reach your heart out.

05:06.265 --> 05:09.727
Please, I beg of you.

05:09.936 --> 05:13.773
Next to Bruce Wayne, my father is probably
the wealthiest man in Gotham City.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.275
He'll pay you anything
if you'll just let me go.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.694
She speaks with straight tongue, sire.

05:18.903 --> 05:22.698
John E. Carson has tons of the stuff.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.534
We could make a good deal.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.119
The market is strong
for young heiresses right now.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.539
Silence, Tutlings.

05:29.747 --> 05:34.252
There will be no deal consummated
until after our marriage.

05:37.755 --> 05:42.635
<i>- I'll</i> do anything if you'll call my father.
- Mmm.

05:45.847 --> 05:47.473
Oh, thank heavens.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.725
You're alive, sir.

05:50.685 --> 05:52.895
Just barely, Alfred.

05:53.104 --> 05:55.773
I came as soon as I received
your Morse Batcode message.

05:55.982 --> 06:00.278
It was really most propitious that I happened
to be dusting the Batcave when you sent it.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.905
I counted on your love for your work.

06:03.114 --> 06:06.951
I don't understand
how you managed to survive with no air...

06:07.159 --> 06:10.204
...and for such a great length of time, sir.

06:10.413 --> 06:14.542
I put myself in a trance
not unlike the Indian fakirs.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.086
It required extreme concentration.

06:17.295 --> 06:20.882
I was able to slow my heart
and respiratory systems to a crawl.

06:21.090 --> 06:25.845
But you were without air for nearly an hour, sir.

06:26.053 --> 06:30.016
Yes, I know of one fakir
who was buried for three years.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.225
Indeed, sir.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.478
Yes, it must have been a remarkable
demonstration of self-control.

06:34.645 --> 06:35.688
Where's Robin?

06:35.897 --> 06:38.733
King Tut removed him from the premises,
where I don't know.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.737
Oh, yes. We must find him.
To the Batcave.

06:43.571 --> 06:48.910
So won't you please call my father,
little baby, hm?

06:49.118 --> 06:53.456
I promise you he'll make you
a very rich man.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.417
Possessing you is all I want.

06:56.626 --> 06:59.211
A boy couldn't ask for anything more.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.256
Will you call him, please?

07:02.465 --> 07:04.634
Pretty please? Would you?

07:04.842 --> 07:09.263
All right. But I insist that he stay away...

07:09.430 --> 07:12.308
...until after the wedding.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.143
Oh, I promise. I promise.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.519
- Agreed?
-Oh, yes. Agreed.

07:15.728 --> 07:17.563
Put her there.

07:28.783 --> 07:30.576
- Hello?
-Hello?

07:30.785 --> 07:33.955
Hello, Dad. This is your future son-in-law.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.498
What?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.626
I'm sure you'll be happy
to welcome me into your family.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.711
I come from good stock.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.091
My father was a king,
grandfather before him, so am I.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.843
Leaving out your larcenous lineage...

07:48.052 --> 07:50.846
...what have you done with
and or to my daughter?

07:51.055 --> 07:52.890
I'm safe, Daddy.

07:53.099 --> 07:57.311
And she'll remain safe for the paltry sum...

07:57.478 --> 08:03.693
...of $8,300,487 and 12 cents,
queen's ransom.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.236
Why such an uneven amount?

08:05.444 --> 08:08.447
<i>I need it to pay off the mortgage
on the pyramids.</i>

08:08.656 --> 08:13.077
The interest rate over 3400 years
is positively usurious.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.453
<i>Very well.</i>

08:14.662 --> 08:18.207
As long as she's in no danger,
no sum of money is too great.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.709
But what about arrangements?

08:19.917 --> 08:22.253
It will take me a while
to get that much cash.

08:22.461 --> 08:27.133
- We'll have to deal through an intermediary.
-I have an idea.

08:27.341 --> 08:32.513
My company sponsors the daily
Jolly Jackson Phone Jockey radio show.

08:32.722 --> 08:35.099
When I've collected
that much money, I'll call in...

08:35.307 --> 08:38.811
...and I'll say, "The sleet in Crete
is never very neat."

08:39.020 --> 08:43.190
- I think you've got it.
-Keep listening to the program.

08:49.155 --> 08:52.158
Operator, get me Commissioner Gordon.

08:58.581 --> 09:02.877
So Tut plans to boil Robin in oil, eh?

09:03.085 --> 09:05.588
I did hear him mention
something to that effect, sir...

09:05.755 --> 09:07.006
...through the skylight.

09:07.214 --> 09:12.720
Also, as I now recall, something
about his royal oil boiling room.

09:12.887 --> 09:16.682
Mm-hm. We'll soon see
about his monstrous scheme.

09:16.891 --> 09:19.727
And next, where he plans to perpetrate it.

09:19.935 --> 09:23.022
Drawing upon my vast storehouse
of chemical knowledge...

09:23.230 --> 09:29.278
...I'm herein concocting an alchemist fluid
which will neutralize the boiling oil.

09:29.487 --> 09:31.697
What exactly does it do, sir?

09:31.906 --> 09:36.202
I'm not quite sure, Alfred. It's the first time
I've ever tried this experiment.

09:36.410 --> 09:43.417
But I think in the end,
it should produce foam rubber.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.461
- Foam rubber, sir?
-Yes, Alfred.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.047
From a tiny capsule like that?

09:48.756 --> 09:54.553
The size of the package, Alfred, is in no way
any indication of the value of its contents.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.098
Of course, sir. Heh. Very apt.

10:02.770 --> 10:03.896
Yes, commissioner.

10:04.063 --> 10:07.149
Urn, first, Batman,
will you be talking to Bruce Wayne?

10:07.358 --> 10:10.027
I occasionally run into him,
commissioner. Why?

10:10.236 --> 10:12.363
I'm worried about my daughter Barbara.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.532
How is she involved in all this?

10:14.740 --> 10:18.702
<i>Well, as Bruce Wayne knows, she's away
at college, she'll be graduating shortly...</i>

10:18.869 --> 10:22.248
...and I'd hate to think that some of the
dire happenings which have happened...

10:22.414 --> 10:27.086
...to that fine professor of Egyptology could also
happen to my beloved daughter at her school.

10:27.294 --> 10:31.549
I rather doubt that your daughter Barbara
is going to get conked on the head...

10:31.757 --> 10:34.635
...and turned into a long-dead
Egyptian ruler, commissioner.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.305
Heh, heh. I know it sounds a little farfetched...

10:38.514 --> 10:43.102
...but she's an only child
and of course, my pride and joy.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.397
I just need a little reassurance.

10:47.106 --> 10:49.275
If I see Bruce Wayne,
I'll ask him to call you.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.611
He knows more about the present
American collegiate scene than I do.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.572
I'd be most grateful, Batman.

10:56.115 --> 11:00.119
You said that was first, commissioner,
what's second?

11:01.787 --> 11:04.623
Second? Oh, yes. Of course. Forgive me.

11:04.832 --> 11:09.003
I must not let my personal concerns conflict
with my public problems.

11:09.211 --> 11:12.006
Are you familiar with Jolly Jackson,
the Phone Jockey?

11:13.340 --> 11:16.969
Isn't he the man who takes calls from people
and then insults them on the air?

11:17.178 --> 11:19.805
Exactly. And here's our predicament...

11:21.390 --> 11:26.478
Our number is klondike-5-8-2-5-7.
The program is "Open Mouth."

11:28.189 --> 11:31.859
- Hello.
-Mr. Jackson, this is Batman.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.820
Sorry about that. I had to cut
you off the air. No names.

11:35.029 --> 11:37.239
But it's important
that my message be heard.

11:37.448 --> 11:41.493
You know, you're the eighth person
that called today claiming to be Batman.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.829
It used to be Napoleon. Now it's Batman.

11:44.038 --> 11:47.416
But I'm really Batman
and I have a message for King Tut.

11:47.625 --> 11:51.045
King Tut'? Listen,
I'm no Egyptian phone jockey, bub.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.506
Maybe not, but this is
a matter of life and death.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.092
Well, you all say the same thing.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.222
All right, listen, if you're really Batman
then you're a very brainy guy, right?

12:01.430 --> 12:02.556
Go on.

12:02.765 --> 12:07.228
Tell me who said, "Biography should
be written by an acute enemy"?

12:07.436 --> 12:11.023
<i>Arthur James Balfour,
born 1848, died 1930.</i>

12:11.232 --> 12:15.069
He was quoted by S.K. Ratcliffe in
the <i>London</i> Observer, January 30, 1927.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.198
Friends, we have
a very special guest on the line.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.326
A great and good friend
of yours truly. Batman.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.996
He has a message for you.
Fire away, caped crusader.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.167
This message is for King Tut only.

12:30.376 --> 12:33.671
I request all other citizens of Gotham City
to comply with my wishes...

12:33.879 --> 12:38.008
...and shut their radios off
for the next 30 seconds.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.940
Curse you, Batman.

12:53.148 --> 12:57.903
May you fall down a flight of stairs and
break every tooth in your head except one...

12:58.112 --> 13:02.866
...and in that, may you have a toothache for
the rest of your life which won't be very long.

13:04.827 --> 13:09.123
Okay, you can turn
your radios up again. Good.

13:09.331 --> 13:13.127
For those of you who didn't hear what Batman
had to say, it was very interesting.

13:13.294 --> 13:16.547
And for those of you who didn't turn
your radios off: Naughty, naughty.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.884
Hello, Jolly Jackson on the line.
Can I help you?

13:21.093 --> 13:23.721
Yeah. This is King Tut speaking.

13:24.555 --> 13:25.764
Well, here we go again.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.935
- Tell that repulsive rodent to--
-Hold on a second, Tutsy.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.437
<i>Sorry to do this, friends...</i>

13:31.645 --> 13:35.482
...but would you mind turning your radios off
again for a few seconds more.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.693
Go ahead, sweetheart.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.657
Tell that blue beanbag
to bring the money...

13:43.866 --> 13:47.036
...to the royal oil boiling room
in the abandoned boiler works...

13:47.244 --> 13:51.665
...in the old Boylston section
of the city tonight. Alone.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.792
And you can also tell him to...

13:57.212 --> 14:00.382
- Oh, oh. Such language.
-Any result, sir?

14:00.591 --> 14:03.052
Yes, Alfred, just as you recalled
and I suspected...

14:03.260 --> 14:05.888
...Tut's holding the girl
in the abandoned boiler works.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.058
Holy steam valve.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.143
Sorry, sir, it just slipped out.

14:11.352 --> 14:14.855
It must be because Master Robin's
uppermost in my thoughts at the moment.

14:15.064 --> 14:17.733
And in mine, Alfred. You mind the store.

14:19.818 --> 14:23.072
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in the royal oil boiling room...</i>

14:23.238 --> 14:26.283
<i>...adjacent to the vacant vat factory...</i>

14:26.450 --> 14:27.576
Ah!

14:27.743 --> 14:31.997
I knew I should have used vegetable oil,
it's not hot enough yet.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.757
Only a few more minutes until countdown.

14:41.965 --> 14:46.762
I think there's enough room in the vat
for Batman, don't you?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.931
About Batman, sire...

14:49.139 --> 14:51.809
...I thought we'd rid ourselves
of him once already this evening.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.770
True. But the caped conniver seems...

14:54.978 --> 14:58.941
...to have a penchant
for escaping from tight places.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.568
He'll not escape this one.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.487
Before this night is out...

15:03.695 --> 15:10.035
...I shall revel in the sight
of a big, crisp, polyunsaturated bat.

15:10.244 --> 15:14.206
And that goes for
his sickening sidekick too.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.835
The banks were all closed.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.921
The most I could muster
was slightly more than 6 million.

15:21.130 --> 15:26.718
That's not enough. That fiend demanded
$8,300,487 and 12 cents...

15:26.885 --> 15:28.512
...and not a penny less.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.472
What can I do?

15:30.681 --> 15:33.684
For once, I just don't know.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.645
Do you think he'd accept
a check for the difference?

15:36.854 --> 15:38.772
It's worth a try.

15:42.151 --> 15:45.654
Batman, please promise
you'll do everything in your power...

15:45.863 --> 15:47.406
...to bring her home safely.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.368
She's the only daughter I have
and I love her very dearly.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.996
You have my word, Mr. Carson.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.960
This ransom will break me,
but I don't care.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.590
Strange. I was under the impression
that you were a multi-multimillionaire.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.091
Everybody thinks so.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.470
But all I have in the world
is now in your hands.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.015
I had hoped to arrange a match
between Lisa and Bruce Wayne.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.934
The combination of our fortunes
would put me back on top...

16:16.143 --> 16:19.104
...and give me room to manipulate.
-A marriage of convenience, eh?

16:19.313 --> 16:22.858
It goes on all the time
among the upper classes.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.153
Normally, I wouldn't think of Bruce Wayne
as a husband for Lisa.

16:26.361 --> 16:31.909
Well, he's a nice enough fellow, but he's
just not marriage material for a girl like Lisa.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.746
Actually, you're more her style.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.706
Me?

16:37.915 --> 16:43.587
I'm afraid not, Mr. Carson.
My heart is already pledged to crime-fighting.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.966
No. No time to tarry.

16:48.175 --> 16:52.095
Lest we forget, lives are at stake.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.517
- Robin.
-Yes.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.227
Is there any hope?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.772
For you maybe,
but I think my goose is cooked.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.112
Listen, kid. You want out of here, right?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.989
Of course I do.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.991
My father will send the ransom money...

17:13.200 --> 17:15.577
...but I'm not so sure King Tut will release me.

17:15.786 --> 17:20.290
Knowing what kind of fink he is,
I'm positive he'll grab you and the loot.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.916
You're going to help us?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.294
Frankly, Robin,
I don't give a darn about you...

17:24.502 --> 17:25.921
...but I want her out of here.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.133
King Tut may be fat, lazy and extremely rude,
but he's all I have.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.470
And with her here
I don't even have that.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.397
Seize them.

17:48.652 --> 17:49.695
Oh.

17:52.239 --> 17:56.410
My queen is disloyal,
the handmaiden is a traitor...

17:56.618 --> 17:58.996
...and everybody is being mean to me.

18:04.501 --> 18:08.922
Very well, you have insulted your king.

18:09.131 --> 18:13.093
So as soon as Batman and Robin
have been fricasseed...

18:13.302 --> 18:15.512
...you'll both join them in yonder pot.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.264
You'll answer to Batman for this.

18:17.472 --> 18:22.603
"You'll answer to Batman for this."
You big tattletale.

18:25.022 --> 18:27.691
Boiling in oil.

18:27.899 --> 18:32.738
One of my dear father's
favorite spectator sports.

18:32.946 --> 18:37.951
Only you won't be a spectator, Batboy.

18:38.160 --> 18:43.832
According to my master plan, the cowled
cornball should be arriving momentarily.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.376
- With the money.
-We'll clobber him.

18:46.585 --> 18:51.840
No, no violence. I can't stand violence.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.009
But I like torture.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.471
It's good, clean fun.

18:57.679 --> 19:03.685
He'll be joining his caped crony
in a double birdbath.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.273
Didn't you find that funny?

19:08.482 --> 19:11.693
The king has made a yuk. Laugh now.
Ha, ha, ha!

19:17.658 --> 19:20.786
Slave girls, ho.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.667
And ten, nine...

19:28.210 --> 19:29.503
...eight...

19:29.670 --> 19:34.716
...seven, six, five...

19:34.925 --> 19:39.554
...four, three, two...

19:39.763 --> 19:42.974
...one, zero.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.355
Ugh!

19:51.233 --> 19:52.901
Into the oil.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.763
Call the commissioner. Tell him Chief O'Hara
and his men can come right over.

21:04.181 --> 21:07.017
Batman, how can I ever thank you?

21:07.225 --> 21:11.480
Having you back with your father and
Bruce Wayne is thanks enough for me.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.064
But what's gonna happen to me?

21:13.273 --> 21:16.443
Don't worry, Neila.
Everything is going to be all right.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.033
Bat.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.954
The new curriculum includes a trip...

21:28.163 --> 21:32.000
...to the archaeological museum and...

21:40.175 --> 21:41.593
Oh.

21:42.761 --> 21:46.890
- Did I do it again?
-You certainly did.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.310
- I hurt anybody?
-Only yourself, professor.

21:50.519 --> 21:53.396
- Only yourself.
-I know.

21:53.605 --> 21:57.025
Oh, I hope the board of regents
will understand...

21:57.234 --> 22:02.197
...that a criminal alter ego
is not an easy thing to overcome.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.866
As a crazed criminal, professor...

22:05.075 --> 22:11.623
...your alter ego would have been dealt
with justly, but firmly, for surely...

22:13.291 --> 22:18.463
...no man is above the law
and no man is below it.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.303
It's been a lovely evening, Bruce.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.180
Yes, I've had a wonderful time too...

22:27.347 --> 22:30.225
...it's just too bad our date had
to be spread over two nights.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.270
But King Tut had other plans for you.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.981
How is the poor, deluded man?

22:36.189 --> 22:38.525
I understand he's doing quite well.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.820
He's undergoing therapy
to cure his ailment.

22:42.028 --> 22:46.867
When he's not functioning as King Tut,
he's really quite normal.

22:47.075 --> 22:50.203
All of us have alter egos we submerge.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.331
True, so true.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.753
Would you like to come in
for a glass of milk and cookies?

23:00.171 --> 23:02.799
I'm afraid it's rather late.

23:03.008 --> 23:05.302
Why, it's 10:30.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.431
On. All right.

23:09.639 --> 23:10.765
Will you call me again?

23:11.933 --> 23:15.395
I wonder if that would be wise, Lisa,
you're a very beautiful woman...

23:15.604 --> 23:18.690
...and you'd make some lucky man
a marvelous wife.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.276
Unfortunately, I'm not that man.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.529
You see,
the Wayne foundation is my wife.

23:24.738 --> 23:28.491
You're just wasting your time with me.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.661
I don't think it's wasting time, Bruce.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.832
It's been very nice knowing you, Lisa.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.128
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.505
A kiss?

23:43.632 --> 23:44.758
Mm-hm.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.637
Well, if you insist.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.306
I do.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.526
Milk and cookies, did you say?

24:05.862 --> 24:08.949
I made the cookies myself.

24:14.245 --> 24:18.333
Man cannot live
by crime-fighting alone.
