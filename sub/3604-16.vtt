15:13.497 --> 15:14.657
What?

15:15.707 --> 15:20.667
Well, no, I'm just wondering
if it's genetic because your
daddy is way into birding.

15:21.505 --> 15:25.544
I went with him sometimes.
He'd come get me up
about 4:00 am,

15:25.884 --> 15:28.500
and we'd be out
walking a trail by dawn.

15:29.387 --> 15:33.721
We'd see goldfinch,
cormorants, woodcocks.

15:34.184 --> 15:38.268
He would be
pulling this old,
rusty wagon behind him,

15:38.396 --> 15:42.014
carrying all
his bird books.
Red wagon.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.771
Yeah, it had these
big rubber wheels...

15:44.861 --> 15:47.443
He used to pull me
in that wagon.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.525
I remember laying
in a red wagon,

15:55.539 --> 15:57.655
all wrapped up
in blankets.

15:57.749 --> 16:01.708
It was still dark,
and the silhouettes
of the tree branches...

16:03.713 --> 16:06.375
I remember thinking
they looked like

16:08.260 --> 16:09.625
snake fingers.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.265
He sold you for money,
you know.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.476
He told me once
he had a little boy
a long time ago,

16:19.813 --> 16:23.055
but he needed cash,
so he sold him.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.732
What kind of man
sells his own son?

16:28.822 --> 16:31.985
Why would he even
tell you something
like that?

16:35.078 --> 16:37.319
Maybe I reminded him of you.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.968
Oh, my God.
I know. It looks harsh.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.344
We tried insulated gloves,
but she shattered
right through them.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.896

is to ensure...
Abby?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.101
This is Tracy Strauss.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.349

17:07.861 --> 17:10.022

for a defense contractor.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.354
Abby, they won't
let me out of here.
You have to do something.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.987

This woman is
extremely dangerous.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.487
Abby, he's lying.
You know me.

17:17.579 --> 17:21.071
This woman is Tracy Strauss,
and you have her shackled
to a chair.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.291
That's why we need
better funding.
Funding?

17:24.419 --> 17:29.504
I am shutting this operation
down today, and then
I'm going to the AG's office

17:29.591 --> 17:32.708
and I'm filing
human rights violations
against you, Senator.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.127

18:03.583 --> 18:06.495

to warn you. You must be
on a list or something.

List? Why is he after me?

18:11.132 --> 18:14.875

Like a special ability
or something?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.888
I can breathe underwater.

in high school.

ljust didn't have to
come up for air anymore.

I didn't know
there were others.

proud of it or something,
but instead ljust...

something out.

should be at home,

my marriage to Deepak.

love Deepak.
