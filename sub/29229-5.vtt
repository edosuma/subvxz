gonna censor me.

08:08.547 --> 08:10.130
How 'bout I talk about
how y'all just sit around here,

08:10.214 --> 08:11.422
barely workin' out,
talking shit,

08:11.506 --> 08:13.130
gossiping like
a bunch of yentas.

08:13.214 --> 08:14.464
- Fuck is a yenta?

08:14.547 --> 08:15.839
- I'm a fuckin' journalist,
all right?

08:15.923 --> 08:16.964
- Hey, Rick, cool out, man.

08:17.047 --> 08:17.964
- I just report about shit

08:18.047 --> 08:19.005
that motherfuckers
don't wanna hear.

08:19.089 --> 08:20.339
- You're fuckin'
black Megyn Kelly.

08:20.422 --> 08:21.464
- Fuck you!

08:21.547 --> 08:22.839
- Ricky, Ricky, Ricky,
come on, come on.

08:22.923 --> 08:25.297
- And what are you?
I'ma--I'ma spit the truth.

08:25.381 --> 08:27.047
- Come--come here.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.673
You know I love you, right?

08:28.756 --> 08:30.839
This place is supposed
to be a low-stress environment.

08:30.923 --> 08:32.172
That's not low stress.

08:32.255 --> 08:34.714
- Look, they--talk to them.
- Hey, hey.

08:34.798 --> 08:37.381
Maybe it's time
you find another gym.

08:37.464 --> 08:38.923
- Come on, Jay, man--I'm--

08:39.005 --> 08:41.005
We unbreakable, man.

08:41.089 --> 08:43.172
- Uh, you broke us.
- Come on, T.

08:43.255 --> 08:46.381
- Mic'll make a motherfucker
say some crazy shit.

08:46.464 --> 08:49.339
- I'll see y'all.

08:49.422 --> 08:52.589
- Used to spend a lot of time
thinking about the future.

08:54.172 --> 08:56.673
I suppose every kid does.

08:56.756 --> 08:59.172
I always wondered
what was out there.

08:59.255 --> 09:01.005
[clock ticking]

09:01.089 --> 09:03.339
Whether I'd
ever leave Bethlehem.

09:03.422 --> 09:07.214
Will my destiny
intervene on my behalf?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.089
Does it even exist?

09:09.172 --> 09:11.714
If it does, then there's
nothing you can do.

09:11.798 --> 09:14.047
If it doesn't...

09:14.130 --> 09:15.923
it's all on us.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.255
No excuses.

09:18.339 --> 09:20.881
Candace.
- Spencer, lookin' sharp.

09:20.964 --> 09:22.756
- Thank you.
This is for you.

09:22.839 --> 09:24.881
- Thank you.
Have a seat.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.089
And welcome to our world.

09:27.172 --> 09:29.923
Different day,
different story.

09:30.005 --> 09:31.381
Some worse than others.

09:31.464 --> 09:33.089
- Yeah, tell me about it.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.506
- Strasmore's first move
as the new owner

09:34.589 --> 09:36.506
and self-appointed GM
of the Chiefs

09:36.589 --> 09:38.214
has been more of the same:

09:38.297 --> 09:39.422
a lightning rod
for controversy.

09:39.506 --> 09:40.714
- This one is bad, though.

09:40.798 --> 09:42.214
- The Chiefs'
continuing PR problem

09:42.297 --> 09:43.756
is only getting worse
with the recent acquisition

09:43.839 --> 09:44.756
of Kisan Teague.

09:44.839 --> 09:46.255
- We need to clean this up

09:46.339 --> 09:47.964
before the CBA negotiations.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.464
- I couldn't agree more.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.547
So let's fix it.

09:52.631 --> 09:53.923
Let's give the guy ten games,

09:54.005 --> 09:55.589
and it'll all blow over
before the playoffs.

09:55.673 --> 09:57.714
- No, we are way
past that point.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.089
- Then give him a year, but
let's not cut the guy's throat.

10:00.172 --> 10:01.964
- It's too late
for a slap on the wrist.

10:02.047 --> 10:03.422
The video's leaking.

10:03.506 --> 10:06.756
- How?
- Does it matter?

10:06.839 --> 10:09.214
- [sighs]
What's on it?

10:10.714 --> 10:12.339
- Take a look for yourself.

10:18.339 --> 10:20.881
- Where is the handsome
bald dude?

10:20.964 --> 10:23.756
- Well, Spencer would
have loved to have been here,

10:23.839 --> 10:27.964
but he's stuck cleaning up
your Kisan-sized mega mess.

10:28.047 --> 10:29.255
- Don't remind me.

10:29.339 --> 10:30.798
It ruined what
would have otherwise been

10:30.881 --> 10:32.297
a beautiful day in paradise.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.506
- No shit. Maybe we can
make your afternoon brighter.

10:34.589 --> 10:35.631
- Yes, we can.

10:35.714 --> 10:37.130
We are prepared to come in

10:37.214 --> 10:38.964
just a smidgen
under Russell Wilson.

10:39.047 --> 10:41.798
130 million,
105 guaranteed.

10:41.881 --> 10:43.172
Boom!

10:43.255 --> 10:45.089
How's that for making
your day bright?

10:45.172 --> 10:47.297
- Just under Russell Wilson?

10:47.381 --> 10:49.130
- Hmm.
He doesn't look impressed.

10:49.214 --> 10:50.589
In fact, he looks
downright miserable.

10:50.673 --> 10:52.798
- Just a crumb below.

10:52.881 --> 10:54.964
- Is that a crumb
or is that a chunk?

10:55.047 --> 10:56.506
You know,
Patrick is a humble guy,

10:56.589 --> 10:58.631
but he still needs
to get paid.

10:58.714 --> 11:00.130
- Don't take this
the wrong way,

11:00.214 --> 11:01.798
but Patrick hasn't done it
as long as Russ.

11:01.881 --> 11:03.130
- No, he hasn't.

11:03.214 --> 11:04.547
He's just doing it better.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.798
- Next thing you know,

11:05.881 --> 11:07.130
he's gonna tell us
he's better than Brady.

11:07.214 --> 11:09.798
- He might be.

11:09.881 --> 11:11.047
Time will tell.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.339
- Live in reality, man.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.589
- The reality is,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.214
Patrick is seven years
younger than Russell,

11:16.297 --> 11:18.631
he's got a better arm,
and he's a goddamn MVP.

11:18.714 --> 11:21.506
Not to mention,
he's the face of the Chiefs

11:21.589 --> 11:23.464
and the future face
of the league.

11:23.547 --> 11:26.881
- We're gonna need a little
bit extra of this dough

11:26.964 --> 11:29.714
to pay for someone
to protect that face.

11:29.798 --> 11:31.964
- Yes, you are.

11:32.047 --> 11:34.005
It's also not
my fuckin' problem.

11:34.089 --> 11:36.255
- I hope he enjoys playing
under his current contract.

11:36.339 --> 11:39.839
- And I hope you enjoy
having a disgruntled superstar.

11:39.923 --> 11:43.547
I mean, that is not a good
look for a new ownership group.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.589
You have a piece, right?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.047
- We do.
- Yeah, we have a piece.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.673
- Well, then we should've
waited for Spencer

11:49.756 --> 11:52.339
to have this meeting,
'cause clearly neither of you

11:52.422 --> 11:54.005
know how this game is played.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.547
- ♪ Hey, guess again

11:55.631 --> 11:57.214

12:02.214 --> 12:03.547
- No, Charles, hear me out.

12:03.631 --> 12:05.506
You cut two of my clients
to clear cap room.

12:05.589 --> 12:06.881
And now you want me
to scratch your back?

12:06.964 --> 12:09.881
How about this?
How about fuck your back.

12:09.964 --> 12:11.172
[laughs]

12:11.255 --> 12:12.964
I hope you get
incurable psoriasis.

12:13.047 --> 12:14.381
- Gavin,
how did this become

12:14.464 --> 12:16.172
about you and me
and skin conditions?

12:16.255 --> 12:18.464
- Alvin is never going
to leave Drew Brees,

12:18.547 --> 12:22.673
who, by the way, I also
represent and vacation with.

12:22.756 --> 12:25.047
- Which, by the way, is
a slight conflict of interest.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.839
- Not to mention,
the guy loves NOLA.

12:27.923 --> 12:29.547
- [sighs]
Gavin, please.

12:29.631 --> 12:30.756
Just take him my offer.

12:30.839 --> 12:33.547
- I'll think about it.
- Stall tactics?

12:33.631 --> 12:35.881
You're really not gonna give
me a shot at this thing, huh?

12:35.964 --> 12:37.422
- Charles,
you're wasting your time

12:37.506 --> 12:40.255
pretending that
this is even a possibility.

12:40.339 --> 12:42.631
And now I am done
wasting mine.

12:42.714 --> 12:44.089
- It's a convers--
[phone beeps]

12:44.172 --> 12:46.130
Hello?

12:50.673 --> 12:54.297
- Refusal to surrender
is a mindset.

12:54.381 --> 12:56.255
Whoa.
Are you okay, boss?

12:56.339 --> 12:57.839
- [sighs]
Yeah, yeah.

12:57.923 --> 12:59.798
Just having
some kind of attack.

12:59.881 --> 13:01.089
- Panic or heart?

13:01.172 --> 13:03.589
'Cause one is way worse
than the other.

13:29.214 --> 13:31.798
You gotta find out
what they put in these lattes.

13:31.881 --> 13:33.422
- Turmeric, I reckon.

13:33.506 --> 13:35.339
They really know how
to treat their employees.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.714
- I need y'all to stop
focusing on the free coffee.

13:37.798 --> 13:38.964
Now, take a look around.

13:39.047 --> 13:41.130
This campus
was built off one game,

13:41.214 --> 13:42.297
"League of Legends."

13:42.381 --> 13:43.464
- That's my game.

13:43.547 --> 13:45.297
- Over a hundred million
monthly players.

13:45.381 --> 13:47.339
- Last year
they made $1.4 billion.

13:47.422 --> 13:48.464
- Smells of money.

13:48.547 --> 13:49.964
[sniffs]
And nerd sperm.

13:50.047 --> 13:52.297
- So how much does it cost
to develop one of these games?

13:52.381 --> 13:54.881
- Couple hundred million--
well, give or take.

13:58.047 --> 14:00.422
- You've wasted my day.

14:02.881 --> 14:04.422
- We're not talkin'
about developing a game.

14:04.506 --> 14:06.839
We want to build
a team to play the game.

14:06.923 --> 14:09.506
- The top esports teams
are worth tens of millions.

14:09.589 --> 14:11.214
Splyce is worth
more than 300, Joe.

14:11.297 --> 14:13.506
- We want our taste.
- And how much is a taste?

14:13.589 --> 14:15.506
- A few million.
- What a bargain.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.214
- That's for an elite
group of players.

14:17.297 --> 14:18.589
Better odds.

14:18.673 --> 14:20.339
- Yeah, elite button pushers.

14:20.422 --> 14:21.464
Amazing.

14:21.547 --> 14:23.172
Anything guaranteed?

14:23.255 --> 14:25.297
- No, but you got
to be in it to win it.

14:25.381 --> 14:27.381
- No!
No, you don't!

14:27.464 --> 14:29.839
Vernon gets a $20 million
signing bonus

14:29.923 --> 14:31.547
before he even
steps onto the field.

14:31.631 --> 14:33.422
Doesn't matter
if he wins or loses.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.964
So I'm not paying
a few million for some nerds

14:35.047 --> 14:37.005
to stare at a screen
and maybe win something

14:37.089 --> 14:38.881
while we hemorrhage
financially

14:38.964 --> 14:40.339
paying for their
Ubers and Quiznos.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.547
Thank you, but no thank you.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.047
- Yeah, but you don't get it.

14:43.130 --> 14:45.464
We're talking about endorsement
deals, Twitch partnerships,

14:45.547 --> 14:47.756
energy drinks,
all kinds of shit.

14:47.839 --> 14:49.422
- Yeah, well, we're
cash poor right now.

14:49.506 --> 14:50.881
Sorry.

14:50.964 --> 14:53.214
- You just spent 50 million
on Jason's fucking agency,

14:53.297 --> 14:54.881
and dude barely
shows up to work!

14:54.964 --> 14:56.089
You won't give me
a fraction of that

14:56.172 --> 14:57.798
to build the future
of our company?

14:57.881 --> 15:00.297
- Jason's business
generates cash flow.

15:00.381 --> 15:01.714
It doesn't suck it.

15:01.798 --> 15:04.714
What you're asking for
is a start-up.

15:04.798 --> 15:06.381
- You don't trust me
to build it.

15:06.464 --> 15:08.506
- Build something
within the framework

15:08.589 --> 15:10.964
that we already have, Reggie,
that's all.

15:11.047 --> 15:12.964
Lance, help me out here.

15:13.047 --> 15:16.547
- I'm sorry to say that
I agree with Reginald here.

15:16.631 --> 15:19.130
- Well, we're gonna have
to agree to disagree.

15:19.214 --> 15:22.422
That's it.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.839
[car door closes]

15:23.964 --> 15:27.923
[engine revs, tires squeal]

15:28.005 --> 15:30.631
- This calls for a new voice
and a new approach.

15:30.714 --> 15:33.631
Mine.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.130
- Look at you, boy.

15:35.214 --> 15:36.964
You're gonna be the first
nigga on the North Pole.

15:37.047 --> 15:39.339
In there looking like
the squirrel off "Ice Age."

15:39.422 --> 15:40.923
- How much--how much time, T?

15:41.005 --> 15:42.923
- You've been in
about two minutes.

15:43.005 --> 15:45.089
- [sighs] Damn.
I must be part Inuit.

15:45.172 --> 15:47.047
- Part what?
How's the leg feel?

15:47.130 --> 15:48.923
- Better than my nuts.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.130
Your turn.
- Shit, man.

15:51.214 --> 15:54.547
I'm down with schvitzing, but
that's where I draw the line.

15:54.631 --> 15:57.506
Come on down.
- Oh, man.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.255
- How's that?
- [groans]

15:59.339 --> 16:01.923
All right, let's get
some borscht, man.

16:02.005 --> 16:03.297
It's the best in the city.

16:03.381 --> 16:05.381
- Oh, man, don't make me
eat that shit again.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.130
- How you gonna be a man
if you don't man up, T?

16:07.214 --> 16:10.506
- We all man up in our
own way, at our own time.
