00:01.418 --> 00:02.960
PAM: (ON PHONE)
Well, l should go.

00:03.045 --> 00:05.213
All right.
l'll tell everybody here
that you say hi.

00:05.297 --> 00:06.964
No, don't.
I'm mad at them.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.424
(CHUCKLES) Why?
What happened?

00:08.509 --> 00:11.469
Not one of them called
to congratulate me
on our engagement.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.720
Ah !

00:12.805 --> 00:16.766
That, they might be
off the hook for,
because l didn't tell them.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.018
What? Why not?

00:19.103 --> 00:22.063
(SOFTLY) l just didn't,
you know, want to deal.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.856
Come on.
It won't be that bad.

00:23.941 --> 00:27.026
Okay. You know what?
Here we go.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.739
Everybody,
l just want to make
an announcement.

00:31.824 --> 00:35.368
Pam and l are engaged.
(ON SPEAKER)
Hi, everyone!

00:35.452 --> 00:37.620
l thought you were
already engaged.
Nope.

00:37.705 --> 00:41.165
That was Roy.
She was engaged to Roy.
Thank you, Angela.

00:41.250 --> 00:45.086
l got a gift for Pam and Roy.
Do l have to get another one?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.254
Yes.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.048
A little close to
my engagement there, Tuna.
What's your game here?

00:49.174 --> 00:52.218
To get married.
She's not a virgin,
you know.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.302
Wow!

00:53.470 --> 00:54.470
What's going on?

00:54.555 --> 00:57.640
No. Nothing.
Nothing, Michael.
Just saying hi.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.767
The tall guy got engaged.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.519
To be married?
Yep.

01:03.939 --> 01:04.939
(GRUNTS)

01:05.566 --> 01:06.691
Sorry.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.800
Pencils down !
Just kidding.
Take your time.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.427
HOLLY: Today is Ethics Day.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.764
After they finish the quiz,
l'm going to run
my first meeting here.

01:37.848 --> 01:44.187
lt's going to be insane.
No, it's not. l have
to read from the binder.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.108
l got it. l got it.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.902
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

02:04.041 --> 02:07.627
(BOTH SINGING)
Let's get ethical, ethical

02:07.711 --> 02:10.463
l want to get ethical

02:10.547 --> 02:12.632
Let's get into ethics, yeah

02:12.716 --> 02:15.301
Let me hear
Dunder Mifflin talk

02:15.385 --> 02:16.469
Your body talk

02:16.553 --> 02:18.846
Let me hear your body talk

02:18.931 --> 02:20.264
(WHOOPS) All right!

02:20.349 --> 02:24.101
"Why are you helping her?
You're not even dating."
She's my friend.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.021
And ultimately my strategy is

02:27.105 --> 02:31.484
to sort of merge this
into a relationship

02:31.568 --> 02:33.569
without her even knowing.

02:34.905 --> 02:39.325
Okay! Let's give it up
for Miss Holly Flax!

02:40.452 --> 02:41.494
HOLLY: Thanks, Michael.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.578
(EXHALlNG)

02:42.663 --> 02:44.831
Today we're going to have
a business ethics seminar

02:44.915 --> 02:47.208
because recently,
without mentioning any names,

02:47.292 --> 02:49.836
there has been some
misconduct at corporate

02:49.920 --> 02:54.257
and we have a very strict
ethics policy and that
employee has been fired.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.678
Come on. He's right there.
He was hired.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.347
Check it out, hired guy.
Nice.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.101
Okay, elephant in the room.
Let's talk about it.

03:05.185 --> 03:09.355
Do l regret what l did?
Of course l do.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.983
Even though it was
an amazing ride
and l'll give an example.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.195
Anyone see Survivor,
Season Six? Anyone know
JoAnna on that show?

03:16.280 --> 03:20.408
ln New York City,
l hooked up with a girl
who looked exactly like that.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.577
lndistinguishable. So. . .

03:23.453 --> 03:27.039
Okay. Well done.
Good speech, Ryan.
You're a good guy.

03:27.124 --> 03:31.043
Let's start discussing
those questionnaires that
you filled in this morning.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.046
lt is wrong to make
personal calls
during work hours.

03:34.131 --> 03:37.008
Now, some of you marked
that you very strongly agree.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.552
But ideally,
you would have selected
"totally agree."

03:39.636 --> 03:44.223
l thought "very strongly
agree" sounded stronger
than "totally agree."

03:44.308 --> 03:46.767
Corporate would like
to emphasize that ideally

03:46.852 --> 03:49.186
you would all totally agree
with that statement.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.524
Well, l think we can
all totally agree that
Holly is totally fantastic.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.986
(MlCHAEL CLAPPlNG)
Thank you.
Okay. Okay.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.823
ln fact, spending a half hour
at the water cooler
during work hours

04:00.908 --> 04:02.366
is a form of stealing.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.492
What?
HOLLY: Yes.

04:03.577 --> 04:07.246
lt's called "time theft"
and it's the same as taking
money from the company.

04:07.331 --> 04:11.250
Can anyone think of examples
of things that are
over-the-line time wasters?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.585
This meeting.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.754
(MEN CHEERlNG)
Can't set them up like that.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.632
Why is it okay for smokers
to take breaks all the time?

04:17.716 --> 04:21.385
lf l want to go outside and
hang out once an hour, then
l'll just take up smoking.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.262
l'll do it. l don't care.
MEREDlTH:
l'll smoke with you.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.805
l got a bag of cigars
in my purse.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.600
Stealing office supplies
is another big ethical area

04:27.684 --> 04:30.019
that there seems to be
some confusion about.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.146
Okay. Could we have
a moment?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.439
(WHlSPERlNG)
Can l talk to you
for a second?

04:33.523 --> 04:34.523
(WHlSPERS) Yeah.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.902
A lot of good stuff.
And you look. . .
You look fantastic.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.779
Michael.
Yeah?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.906
What should we be working on
while you guys are talking?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.783
Do some. . .
Do some work.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.328
(WHlSPERlNG)
People expect a lot
from these meetings.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.123
Laughter, sudden twists,
surprise endings,

04:51.208 --> 04:55.461
you need to be Robin Williams
and M. Night Shyamalan.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.088
You need to be
Robin Shyamalan.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.714
(WHlSPERlNG) Well,
l just have to get
through the binder.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.466
You're. . . lt's just,
you're kind of losing them.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.550
l am?
Yeah.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.595
Don't think about the stakes.
lt'll freak you out.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.432
Okay. Well,
Michael makes
a really good point.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.102
So, let's just open
this up a little bit.

05:11.186 --> 05:16.107
Say my name is Lauren
and here l am shopping
in a supermarket

05:16.191 --> 05:18.234
and l steal a pencil.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.238
That's not right.
(COUGHlNG) Lauren !
Enough with the pencils!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.448
No. l have to
go over pencils
and office supplies.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.743
lt's part of
the ethics thing.
That isn't ethics.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.580
Ethics is a real discussion
of competing conceptions
of the good.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.458
This is just the corporate
anti-shoplifting rules.

05:34.543 --> 05:39.088
l'll drop an ethics bomb
on you. Would you steal
bread to feed your family?

05:39.548 --> 05:40.548
Boom !

05:40.632 --> 05:44.427
Exactly, Andy.
Yeah. l took lntro
to Philosophy twice.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.637
No big deal.
lt's a trick question.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.849
The bread is poisoned.
Also, it's not
your real family.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.768
You've been cuckolded
by a stronger, smarter male.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.979
No, that's not
how it works.

05:56.481 --> 06:03.154
l would not steal the bread.
And l would not let
my family go hungry.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.698
HOLLY: Okay.
But we should get
back to business.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.785
Have any of you
ever faced any ethical
dilemmas in the workplace?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.413
MlCHAEL: Anybody?

06:12.497 --> 06:16.042
This is a chance
for you to say something
without any repercussions.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.545
Stanley?
Oscar, come on.
l'll pass.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.422
l will go first.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.925
When l discovered YouTube,
l didn't work for five days.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.219
l did nothing.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.724
l viewed Cookie Monster
Sings ChocoIate Rain
about 1 ,000 times.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.436
What was the dilemma?
To tell you or not.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.815
And l'm glad l did.
l feel very, very good.
Cathartic.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.526
l promise you that
you are not going
to get into trouble.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.489
You can say anything
you want with total
and complete immunity.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.159
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah. Come on.
Anybody. Let it fly.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.204
Okay. Once in a while,
l'll take a long lunch.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.415
A siesta.
Time thief.
Time thief. Fire him !

06:56.500 --> 07:00.252
Dwight, you've really never
stolen any company time?

07:00.337 --> 07:05.132
Never.
You are a thief of joy.
Anybody else? Yeah?

07:05.217 --> 07:08.219
Sometimes l download
pirated music onto
my work computer.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.930
Who hasn't? Good.
Good. What else?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.765
No, l'd like to hear
more about that.

07:12.849 --> 07:18.562
l once reported Oscar to
the lNS. Turns out he's clean,
but l'm glad l did it.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.857
Well, let's keep
this party moving on.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.192
l'll go.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.612
Have you guys ever met
Bruce Myers, the Scranton
rep for Hammermill?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.155
Bruce.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.741
Well, for the past six years
l have been sleeping with him

07:30.826 --> 07:35.871
in exchange for discounts
on our supplies and Outback
Steakhouse gift certificates.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.164
Jackpot.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.125
(LAUGHS)

07:39.209 --> 07:41.919
(CLEARS THROAT)
Meredith, that is serious.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.381
l mean, not only is that
a conflict of interest,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.633
but there's also
an exchange of goods.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.262
Exchange of steak.
Have you ever had
sirloin steak, honey?

07:51.346 --> 07:54.473
That's crazy.
That's crazy talk.

07:54.558 --> 07:59.228
Meredith, "the Merenator,"
sleeping with suppliers.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.896
(LAUGHS)

08:01.898 --> 08:02.940
Wow!

08:03.024 --> 08:04.150
What time we got?

08:04.234 --> 08:06.485
You know what?
That's a good place
to end it.

08:06.570 --> 08:10.239
Right there.
This, l think, was
a great ethics seminar.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.659
She has given us
a lot of wonderful
things to think about.

08:13.743 --> 08:19.165
Right. What is wrong?
Who's to say, really,
in the end?

08:19.249 --> 08:23.210
l mean, because it is
unknowable. But let's
give her a round of applause.

08:23.295 --> 08:26.589
Holly, everybody! Holly!
Get back to work.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.553
Great job.
l am truly impressed.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.263
That. . . You really
pulled that one out.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.765
Classic. Classic meeting.
We should celebrate.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.394
Michael, there's
some serious issues
with Meredith.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.063
l mean, all of you
have done things
l wouldn't have done myself,

08:43.148 --> 08:45.691
but Meredith's actions
are really over the line.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.235
Yeah. What are you
going to do?

08:54.034 --> 08:59.914
So regarding this supplier,
approximately how many
liaisons have there been?

08:59.998 --> 09:05.085
Liaisons? You mean
meet-ups? l don't know.
Once a month for six years.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.212
Something like that.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.424
Meredith, why don't you
tell Holly it's not
what she thinks,

09:10.508 --> 09:16.263
nothing unethical happened
and that you just like
to sleep around?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.474
Am l in trouble here
or something?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.143
No. No. This is just
a stupid formality.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.146
No, it's not a formality.

09:24.231 --> 09:30.486
Now, were these
"meet-ups" just personal,
unrelated to business?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.781
No. l wouldn't have
done it if it wasn't
for the discount paper.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.532
There's not
a lot of fruit
in those looms.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.245
(EXCLAlMS) For the love
of God, we're trying to
help you, you stupid bag.

09:39.329 --> 09:44.208
What l don't understand is,
why the steak coupons?

09:44.292 --> 09:47.461
l mean, if you were
already getting
the discounted paper. . .

09:47.545 --> 09:52.633
Well, it's funny,
maybe it's a girl thing,
but after we did it,

09:52.717 --> 09:56.845
when he would give me
those coupons, l just
felt good about myself.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.937
Hey, what's going on here?
l thought l had immunity.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.815
Well, unfortunately,
immunity or something
being off the record

10:07.899 --> 10:10.150
does not really exist
in the workplace.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.946
l mean, l've never heard
of anyone who kept their job
after something like this.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.156
Well, l'm not quitting.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.957
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

10:26.334 --> 10:27.293
(EXHALlNG)

10:27.377 --> 10:28.752
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

10:28.837 --> 10:33.465
Yawn, four seconds.
What are you doing?

10:33.550 --> 10:36.135
You had said that you don't
do anything personal
during work time,

10:36.219 --> 10:38.470
so l'm just making sure.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.182
Wait a minute. So you're
going to time me every time
l yawn? That's absurd.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.143
Really?

10:44.227 --> 10:47.771
Hey, look, monkey knows
how to use a stop watch,
everybody.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.064
He's. . .

10:52.277 --> 10:53.610
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

10:54.321 --> 10:57.114
Personal conversation.
1 7 seconds.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.158
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)
There is no way
that that was. . .

10:59.242 --> 11:00.826
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

11:00.910 --> 11:02.286
One second.

11:05.415 --> 11:11.337
Well, well, Holly-lujah !
lt's a miracle
you're at your desk.

11:11.463 --> 11:17.009
lt's Mike-raculous.
(LAUGHS) Reaching.
You'll get there.

11:17.093 --> 11:22.973
Anyway, l was giving it
some thought, and there's
no reason that two attractive,

11:23.058 --> 11:29.772
good looking,
intelligent, funny,
attractive people can't,

11:29.856 --> 11:32.900
you know, just sit down
and work this whole
Meredith thing out.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.110
Sounds good.
Good.

11:36.237 --> 11:40.282
Would you care to
bang it out over lunch?
l already bought this.

11:40.367 --> 11:45.996
No, no, no.
Your food is no good
here, my lady.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.415
Sorry.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.294
You know what?
Let's go out.
Dunder Mifflin's treat.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.967
Actually,
you're not a client,
so we'll just split it?

12:00.178 --> 12:01.428
Ethical.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.559
So, l've gone over
corporate policy.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.729
What do you think?
What do you think
of this place?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.272
lt's very nice.
lsn't it?

12:12.357 --> 12:16.902
Yeah. lt's kind of
business romantic.
So you're from Des Moines.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.322
Mmm.
That sounds so warm.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.616
ln summer.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.745
Here, too.
You know what
my favorite season is?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.497
Maybe we should talk
about Meredith first.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.666
Yes. Get the boring stuff
out of the way.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.503
Autumn was what l was
going to say. When the
leaves change, it's just. . .

12:34.587 --> 12:38.465
l think it's the most
contemplative of seasons.

12:39.008 --> 12:43.095
Okay, so l've gone over this
and l've thought about it
and l just don't think

12:43.179 --> 12:47.224
there's any way l can write
a report that doesn't end
with her being terminated.

12:48.810 --> 12:53.605
Terminate her. Terminator.
(MlMlCS ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER)
"l'm from the future."

12:54.149 --> 12:55.274
Yeah.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.986
Hey, Andy.
Yo.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.738
By any chance, did you
see Battlestar Galactica
last night?

13:01.823 --> 13:04.324
No, l did not.
Was that any good?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.410
Actually not.
lt was really so-so.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.578
Okay.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.373
l mean, l like
all the crazy monsters
and stuff, you know,

13:11.458 --> 13:15.711
like Klingons and Wookiees
and all that, but. . .

13:17.589 --> 13:20.215
Sorry, was there something
you wanted to add, Dwight?

13:22.719 --> 13:25.387
ls that anything
like the original
Battlestar Galactica?

13:25.472 --> 13:29.183
You know what's weird?
lt's practically
a shot-for-shot remake.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.559
Really?

13:32.687 --> 13:35.272
That's cool.
The story's kind of bland.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.733
lt's about this guy named
Dumbledore Calrissian. . .

13:37.817 --> 13:40.152
Okay.
. . .who needs to return
the ring back to Mordor.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.195
(HUFFlNG)

13:41.279 --> 13:44.072
Really.
That doesn't sound right.

13:45.241 --> 13:51.705
l just don't want my employees
thinking that their jobs
depend on performance.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.751
l mean, what sort of place
is that to call home?

13:56.878 --> 14:00.839
And Meredith needs
this job. This is
her main source of money.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.842
Well, that's
very sweet, but we have
to follow the protocol.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.346
Those are the rules.
Okay, new idea.
We don't report it at all.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.515
We just punish her.
We punish her?

14:09.599 --> 14:12.392
Tell her,
"Can't have sex
for six months."

14:12.477 --> 14:14.228
l don't think
we could enforce that.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.898
l don't know.
l saw this thing.
Like a belt with a key.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.233
A chastity belt.

14:19.317 --> 14:25.739
No, it's more of an underwear
garment that has little
spikes, like, made of. . .

14:25.823 --> 14:28.951
Like sometimes they're
made of metal. You know
what l'm talking about?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.912
You unlock
a little door that. . .

14:31.996 --> 14:37.000
Down where you. . .
Where you put. . .
Where you put the. . .

14:44.342 --> 14:48.136
He has not stopped
working for a second.

14:49.347 --> 14:53.809
At 1 2:45, he sneezed
while keeping his eyes open,

14:54.686 --> 14:57.229
which l always thought
was impossible.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.897
At 1 :32, he peed.

14:58.982 --> 15:03.068
And I know that because
he did it in an open
soda bottle under the desk

15:03.152 --> 15:05.070
while filling out
expense reports.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.196
And on the flip side,

15:06.281 --> 15:10.033
l've been so busy
watching him that
l haven't even started work.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.703
lt's exhausting,
being this vigilant.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.831
l'll probably have
to go home early today.

15:16.082 --> 15:21.670
l am just saying that
l don't think that you
understand what l am saying.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.424
No, you are saying
that we should sweep
it under the carpet,

15:25.508 --> 15:28.927
accept the discount
on supplies, not fire Meredith

15:29.012 --> 15:32.014
and pretend like the whole
thing never happened.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.600
Yes.
What am l saying?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.767
Well. . .

15:37.228 --> 15:38.520
(LAUGHS) Busted. l don't. . .

15:38.605 --> 15:42.149
l'm saying that
her behavior is unethical,
and a little icky.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.276
And l don't think l want
to work in an environment

15:44.360 --> 15:46.486
where that sort
of conduct is tolerated.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.031
Well, you have
to tolerate a lot when
you're part of a family.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.658
lt's not a family.
lt's a workplace.

16:05.131 --> 16:09.676
l will be honest with you.
That car ride did not go well.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.803
And that was not my fault.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.139
The only reason
l am standing
out here right now

16:14.223 --> 16:17.643
is because
l don't want to take
the elevator with her.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.771
And l am holding
on to her leftovers.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.201
(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

16:35.161 --> 16:37.496
Nineteen minutes
and 48 seconds.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.707
What were we doing
for 1 9 minutes
and 48 seconds?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.668
None of your business.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.005
So l guess l can assume
that was personal.

16:53.596 --> 16:54.680
Fine.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.893
So maybe you're not
completely ethical after all.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.271
Yes. Maybe l'm not.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.292
lt's been a little tense.

17:25.628 --> 17:31.383
People are suspicious of me
and my best friend in the
office won't even talk to me.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.846
Turns out being
the morality police
does not make you popular.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.557
I should know,
because in middle school
I was the hall monitor

17:38.641 --> 17:42.060
and the kids used to stuff
egg salad in my locker.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.230
Yeah, l was just hoping
middle school was over.

17:50.695 --> 17:54.072
Kendall from corporate HR
is on line one and
Holly's on her way in, too.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.742
What's the only thing
worse than one HR rep?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.994
Two HR reps.
You get me.

17:59.996 --> 18:00.996
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)

18:01.080 --> 18:03.248
Can l sit?
l don't know, can you?

18:06.002 --> 18:07.502
Kendall, my main man.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.588
KENDALL: (ON PHONE)
Listen, Holly, Michael,

18:09.672 --> 18:11.423
l just got the report
that your branch submitted.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.593
And there's a lot of
stuff about a relationship
Meredith's having with a...

18:14.677 --> 18:16.803
Yes, that came out during
the ethics seminar. . .

18:16.888 --> 18:20.599
And let the record show
that it was during the
immunity part of the seminar.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.560
Well, I'm not sure
these circumstances
warrant any action.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.812
l think
it's pretty clear
it was unethical.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.607
Well, from what l can gather,
it seems like a gray area.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.401
Look, to be honest,
the company's getting
a discount at a tough time

18:31.486 --> 18:34.696
in our balance sheet and
l don't know that the right
thing to do for the company

18:34.781 --> 18:36.782
is to turn our
noses up at that.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.951
Kendall, l understand
that the discount is
good for the company,

18:40.036 --> 18:43.455
but l'm just not happy about
the way we're getting it.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.625
(SIGHS) You see, I thought
l was clear with you, Holly.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.126
Your task was
to get signatures

18:48.211 --> 18:51.087
from the employees
showing that they
completed the training.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.214
No, l understand.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.299
Because every other branch
has managed to get this to us,

18:54.383 --> 18:57.427
so if it's not something
you can handle, then
that's a different discussion.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.971
No. No, l can do it.
Good.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.723
(DlAL TONE BEEPS)

19:05.895 --> 19:11.107
How do you tell somebody
that you care about deeply,
"l told you so"?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.861
Gently, with a rose?

19:16.906 --> 19:20.826
ln a funny way?
Like it's a hilarious joke?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.330
Or do you just let it go?

19:25.957 --> 19:29.042
Because saying it would
just make things worse.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.213
Probably the funny way.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.007
Can l have
everyone's attention?

19:37.093 --> 19:40.679
Excuse me.
May l have everyone's
attention, please?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.806
We need to finish
the ethics seminar.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.975
No way, lady.
lt's a trap.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.227
Everyone, please,
l just need
your signatures

19:47.311 --> 19:49.020
to show corporate
that l gave you
the training.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.398
Don't sign anything.
Okay, everybody,
listen up,

19:51.482 --> 19:53.733
if you're not in
that conference room
in two minutes,

19:53.818 --> 19:55.193
l am going to kill you.

19:55.278 --> 19:58.238
lt's a quarter to 5:00
and l have started
to gather my things.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.117
Get in there right now
or l'm going to lose it!

20:13.087 --> 20:14.254
(WHlSPERlNG)
Am l getting fired?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.798
Now is really not
the time, Meredith.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.218
ln this next section
we examine the difference

20:20.303 --> 20:23.138
between sick days
and personal days.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.600
Sick days are only
to be used when
an illness precludes you

20:26.684 --> 20:30.854
from doing your job
or can spread
to your co-workers.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.316
Personal days,
on the other hand,
are much more flexible.

20:36.861 --> 20:40.405
Thank you, Meredith,
this was delicious.
Hey, where's the steak sauce?

20:41.365 --> 20:44.910
l think we're out.
l got some
in my minivan somewhere.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.873
Wait a second,
how does this steak
factor in again?

20:49.957 --> 20:54.586
l think she got it as a tip,
but l don't know why
she didn't just take cash.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.213
l don't care what
she's doing, l hope
she just keeps doing it.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.633
(CHUCKLlNG)
Amen. Just keep
the ribs coming.
