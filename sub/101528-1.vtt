00:54.388 --> 00:56.128
Neil degrasse Tyson:
That universe.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.262
Because we look this way,

00:58.433 --> 01:01.470
we see about the same number of galaxies
this way as that way, as that way.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.039
It kind of looks like
we're at the center,

01:03.063 --> 01:04.849
and they're all
receding from us.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.513
So, hey,
we're at the center there.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.853
You know, but now...
We're smarter than this now.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.484
We say, "we're not gonna fall
for that," okay?

01:11.655 --> 01:15.193
We've fallen for that one nine times already.
We're not gonna fall for this again.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.387
Interviewer: You mean somebody's
sitting there in the corner thinking,

01:17.411 --> 01:20.494
"every time we make ourselves the
star of the show, we're wrong"?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.825
Tyson: So, we're not gonna
make that mistake again.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.369
So, you then apply Einstein's general
theory of relativity, and it says,

01:27.546 --> 01:32.256
"if you live in an expanding universe,
in this fabric of space and time,

01:32.426 --> 01:35.793
"no matter where you are, it will
look like you're at the center.â

01:35.971 --> 01:38.383
Interviewer: So, what? There is no center?
Tyson: Yes.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.637
Interviewer: Every center is an illusion?
Tyson: Yes.

01:42.227 --> 01:46.596
Tyson: That's how we could look like we're
at the center of the actual universe,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.100
even though we're not,

01:48.191 --> 01:52.184
because everybody sees the same
signature of the expansion.

01:52.362 --> 01:56.321
Now, there's an even stronger
argument than the numerics.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.197
Let's look
at the ingredients of...

01:58.368 --> 01:59.574
No. Jack: What?

01:59.745 --> 02:01.781
No, no, no, no. No, no.
What's happening?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.161
Oh, my god, this is bad.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.538
Wait, is it North Korea?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.699
All my tabs. What?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.208
My tabs!

02:08.377 --> 02:10.663
My tabs, my Internet tabs.
They're gone.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.081
Jesus, su.
Did you use my computer?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.051
What are we talking about?

02:17.095 --> 02:18.095
"Adventures in sourdough,

02:18.180 --> 02:20.136
"seven tips
from seven master bakers."

02:20.974 --> 02:22.009
Alexa, pause.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.517
I mean,
your computer was closer.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.971
I was making the bread. Jack!

02:35.072 --> 02:37.063
Alexa, play.
Just for future reference...

02:37.240 --> 02:39.481
Alexa, pause.
I keep my tabs organized.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.116
In this case, all of the flights

02:41.203 --> 02:43.285
I lined up for Stephanie,
which you just obliterated.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.330
Su, how hard is it to just
aggregate all the flights?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.535
I'm sorry.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.126
This is my job, Jack.
It's important.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.252
Alexa, play.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.375
Alexa, stop.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.582
You know, in the world,
in this city,

02:56.677 --> 02:59.589
there are so many things
that are more important.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.671
Okay. What's an important thing?

03:01.765 --> 03:02.971
There's so many.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.014
Name one thing.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.930
Um...

03:08.855 --> 03:11.141
Uh, food wastage.
Great, very good.

03:11.233 --> 03:15.021
In New York alone, a quarter
of the food is wasted.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.895
And it's not just the wasting.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.275
It's the food scraps that get
trapped under other garbage,

03:20.367 --> 03:21.698
and that creates methane.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.225
That's why I always
make the exact...

03:31.169 --> 03:33.876
Done already?
She changed her mind.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.463
I love you.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.502
That's nice.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.296
Did you mean to say,
"I'm sorry"?

03:44.474 --> 03:47.261
Yeah. I'm sorry.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.725
What are you sorry for?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.433
For the thing that you
want me to apologize for.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.318
"Su, I'm sorry for
turning on your computer

03:58.405 --> 03:59.895
"and not restoring all your tabs

03:59.990 --> 04:03.198
"before I started new
bullshit tabs of my own."

04:03.368 --> 04:05.199
Hmm. Yeah, that's it.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.235
Are you listening? Okay, okay.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.538
I am so sorry, soup,

04:10.709 --> 04:14.452
for deleting all of your tabs,
which are very well organized

04:14.629 --> 04:19.339
and I know are very important
to you for work.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.297
A kiss here, please.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.677
That's five bucks.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.815
How long do we have
before the party?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.227
Why? What do you wanna do
before the party?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.565
What... I...

04:41.740 --> 04:43.071
I think you know.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.731
What are we doing?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.704
It's the groom-to-be. Sorry.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.090
Oh, Kylie had a baby.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.475
Ah.

05:29.454 --> 05:35.745
Woman: Andromeda's
a big wide-open galaxy

05:36.336 --> 05:39.123
nothing in it for me

05:39.214 --> 05:43.583
"cept my heart that's lazy

05:43.677 --> 05:47.169
runnin' from my own life now

05:47.264 --> 05:50.631
I'm really turnin' some time

05:50.725 --> 05:54.513
lookin" up to the sky for

05:54.604 --> 06:01.521
something I may never find

06:01.611 --> 06:07.231
stop calling

06:08.159 --> 06:12.323
it's time to

06:16.710 --> 06:19.873
if you think you can save me

06:19.963 --> 06:26.926
I dare you to try

06:27.012 --> 06:31.631
stegosauruses are further from t.
Rexes than t. Rexes are from humans.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.762
Okay, so humans have been around

06:34.853 --> 06:37.560
for 200,000 years, give or take.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.103
Mmm-hmm.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.602
But then dinosaurs, right...
T. Rexes specifically.

06:41.693 --> 06:46.437
They were 65 million years ago, right?
That's 65 million years. Bam.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.897
We're taking it back
100 million years before that,

06:48.992 --> 06:51.108
that's when stegosauruses
were popping off.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.868
We're only, uh, dust bags.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.870
You know, it's like our
individual lives are meaningless,

06:59.961 --> 07:02.122
if you think about it.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.704
But only if you think about it.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.669
Well, you know,
a fun fact about dinosaurs

07:10.764 --> 07:13.597
is they were actually
very small.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.516
Mexico City! That's so hip.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.603
I know.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.687
Ah! Are you so excited?

07:18.772 --> 07:19.887
We're so excited.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.768
We're doing, like, a whole
low-footprint wedding thing.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.941
So nothing disposable,
no plastic straws.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.110
Get that out. Oh, hi.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.153
Oh, and Cal's parents
are flying in

07:29.240 --> 07:32.448
a 12-piece New Orleans
brass band, honey.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.900
Twelve-piece. What?

07:33.995 --> 07:35.986
Yeah. My goodness.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.683
We didn't want to do
the whole mariachi thing

07:37.707 --> 07:39.993
'cause it felt a little
too much like appropriation.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.917
Hey.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.168
Hey!

07:48.259 --> 07:50.500
Stop.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.710
Is that Raph?

07:58.895 --> 08:02.012
There's this volcano there though,
it's called the Managua volcano.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.349
Oh, my god. It sits in the
middle of this expansive lake,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.729
which creates
these offshore winds,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.937
which produces
these gigantic waves.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.740
They're like glass sculptures of waves.
It's awesome.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.193
So it's perfect for this thing
I'm prototyping.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.866
Tubular. Yeah, what
are you prototyping?

08:18.957 --> 08:22.996
Uh... it's, uh, 3D-printed
surfboards made out of algae.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.249
You know, the bad kind? It's
terrorizing the ecosystem out there.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.502
So we're finding
another use for it.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.753
We're borrowing inspiration
from whale tails.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.381
Wow. That's incredible.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.383
I would love to do
something like that.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.010
You know, like,
something tangible.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.386
You can.

08:40.477 --> 08:44.187
Well, yeah,
but we have jobs and...

08:44.274 --> 08:45.935
Raph was an investment banker.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.392
The lost decade, yeah.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.601
Whoa.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.028
How did you get out of that?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.365
I just quit. You know?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.989
I mean, it was changing
the chemistry of my brain.

08:58.079 --> 09:02.072
I was full of a very
slow-burning rage for some time.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.824
I think I have that.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.669
Man, Nicaragua, huh?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.922
Living the dream.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.295
Well, you know, I'm back
and forth quite a bit.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.877
I've been restoring my
grandfather's cabin upstate,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.054
and it's almost done, and...

09:18.141 --> 09:19.506
Actually, this is perfect.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.058
Y'all should enjoy it.
You should go up there.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.760
It's always in need
of inhabitants.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.095
Uh... l mean...

09:25.190 --> 09:26.851
That would be great. Yeah.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.264
Yeah, I mean, only if you want
us to do that. So generous.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.776
If you want. Yeah. Great.
We like that type of stuff.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.481
Oh. Jack, I almost forgot. I got
you something in patagonia.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.236
Me? Yeah.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.153
My god, it's a rock.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.113
It's a crystal.
It's a crystal, yeah.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.074
I thought of you when I saw it.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.832
I know it's kind of kooky, but if
you are feeling stressed or angry,

09:49.923 --> 09:53.165
just hold it in your hand,
and it really helps.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.294
Cool. Yeah.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.921
Thanks, Raph. You're welcome.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.890
I want to start
a community garden.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.969
I want to get some dirt
under my fingernails.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.520
Did you see Raph's hands?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.972
Were they dirty?

10:09.067 --> 10:12.309
No, they were,
like, worn, you know?

10:13.238 --> 10:14.398
Yeah.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.150
I want to be vegetarian again.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.698
Yeah.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.073
It really just makes you
rethink all your life choices.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.615
Mine?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.788
No, no, like a collective you.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.415
Yeah. Yeah.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.334
Yeah. I want to
be better people.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.036
Like a collective people?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.589
No, like us. Like the two of us.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.418
Oh, yeah. No, that's
what I'm talking about.

10:48.481 --> 10:53.350
Woman: As she knows me

10:53.444 --> 10:58.108
are you with me now?

11:02.579 --> 11:05.070
Ah

11:07.250 --> 11:10.492
Are you with me now?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.961
Thank you.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.913
Yeah, we're disconnecting.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.840
Yeah.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.385
Yeah, reconnecting with
each other, I suppose.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.506
Hi, Stephanie. This is su.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.601
I think so.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.676
I'm sorry to bother you
on the weekend.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.103
I just wanted
to make sure you, um...

11:31.191 --> 11:32.306
Yeah.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.058
Got my e-mail.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.361
I wanted to talk to you about
maybe taking this week off.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.939
Well, I have about five...
It's in the e-mail.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.195
Or seven clients... and I
sent you a dropbox link...

11:43.328 --> 11:45.681
Who may need maintenance while I'm gone.
Of anything you might need.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.788
Honestly, I don't think so. Yeah,
I just hope it's all okay.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.160
Um...

11:50.251 --> 11:52.367
Thank you. Bye.

11:53.671 --> 11:59.007
Yeah, so, just pull up
pizzabythedozen.Com.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.043
Yeah, let me know
when you get there.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.591
That's it.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.263
Yeah.

12:08.645 --> 12:13.105
So, they want the users to be able to
star and unstar posts, which is...

12:13.191 --> 12:14.806
I'm fired.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.066
Hey, hang on a sec, dyl.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.691
What?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.652
I mean, can you call her back?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.612
Can you talk to her about this?

12:30.917 --> 12:34.250
Hey, I mean, we...
We don't have to do this.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.086
No.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.414
This is good.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.841
This is a good thing.
It's a good thing.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.802
Are you sure?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.260
Yeah. It's good.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.470
Okay.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.275
Hey, dyl.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.237
I just plucked
a gray nipple hair.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.242
Whoo.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.705
Ooh. New notebook?

13:16.796 --> 13:21.586
Yeah. I'm rethinking my whole life,
so I thought I'd get a freshy.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.798
This will be great, su.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.137
And it's only for one week.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.381
We'll just get away

13:30.476 --> 13:32.933
and let our brain chemistry
sort itself out.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.306
Yeah.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.012
It'll be great.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.563
Yeah.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.772
Jack: I'm proud of us.

13:51.414 --> 13:59.414
You put the big soap
into the little soap

14:01.132 --> 14:02.793
Jack: Big soap

14:02.884 --> 14:04.590
little soap

14:04.677 --> 14:08.044
you put the big soap
into the little soap

14:09.098 --> 14:11.680
you got confirmation
from Raph, right?

14:11.768 --> 14:15.306
Yep. Key is in the garlic braid.
Whatever that is.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.471
I almost forgot my starter.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.806
Su: You're bringing that?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.857
Yeah, it has to be fed.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.150
Okay.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.943
You got everything, right?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.522
Yeah. It's not the end of the
world if we forget something.

14:34.665 --> 14:40.035
Woman: Everyone I
know is with me in a dream

14:40.129 --> 14:42.336
I know that they're not...

14:42.423 --> 14:45.290
Su: Ooh. Chicken,
chicken, chicken.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.754
Full hearts and your eyes on the
prize and I'll keep it all inside

14:56.145 --> 14:57.681
Booch!

15:02.985 --> 15:04.850
I forgot to tell my mom.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.653
That's what
the voicemail is for.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.358
She'll hear the voicemail,
and she'll know what's up.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.989
She's gonna freak about my job.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.787
So she can freak in a week.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.083
Yeah. Okay, ready?

15:21.921 --> 15:22.956
Yes.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.788
Thank you.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.749
Okay. Okay.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.256
One, two, three.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.008
Hello, this is Jack. And su.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.925
And we are going off-line
for one whole week,

15:37.019 --> 15:39.260
but we will be back June 9th.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.519
Su: So if you need us,
um, too bad.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.521
We will have no phones
and no laptops.

15:46.612 --> 15:51.231
Jack: And we're not checking our e-mail
either, guys. And we are not kidding, so...

15:51.325 --> 15:53.441
Su: Bye, world. Jack: Bye.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.669
Jack: Wow. Is this it?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.920
Su: Yeah.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.843
Jack: Jeez.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.340
Su: It's so nice.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.352
Oh, wow.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.274
The air 1s so clean.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.191
This is nice. This is so nice.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.282
This is the best thing
we've ever done.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.779
Jack: Nice.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.662
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.788
What?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.747
Alexa, play Whitney Houston.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.336
What are you doing? Shh.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.421
Siri, play Whitney Houston.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.259
Okay, Google, read Moby-dick.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.741
I looked up some hikes last night
and put them in my notebook.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.286
Jack: You're a genius.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.329
Okay. Let's go.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.417
Go without me.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.195
Whoa. Look at these ants. They're
in a tug-of-war over this crumb.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.539
There's more.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.119
Whoa.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.329
There's a whole line of 'em.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.664
Whoa.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.004
Wow.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.132
They are really going at it.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.095
What? I like ants.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.265
It's funny.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.687
They think this crumb
is so important.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.900
Little do they know,
there are two giant humans

18:32.987 --> 18:35.945
standing right next to them that
could crush them at any moment.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.864
Must be hunting season.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.795
Jack: Man, it really is
beautiful out here though.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.377
We should go build a fire.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.792
Okay. Yeah?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.135
Um...

19:00.306 --> 19:05.346
Jack, I was thinking we could
try something this week.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.142
Okay.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.309
I was thinking about

19:08.397 --> 19:10.353
the things that we're
trying to achieve,

19:10.441 --> 19:12.602
so I wrote this stuff down.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.812
Um...

19:15.529 --> 19:17.065
Okay, wait. What is this?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.989
What is this?
Let me see. Let me see.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.567
"How to be a better 'we.'

19:22.662 --> 19:25.529
"tips for achieving
authenticity in life and love."

19:25.623 --> 19:26.954
What? Yeah.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.906
Is this a list
from the Internet?

19:29.794 --> 19:31.079
Well, yeah, but I handwrote it.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.252
Su. Well, the printer
wasn't working.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.043
Sul! I just...

19:36.133 --> 19:38.249
I just wanted
to have a starting point

19:38.386 --> 19:40.001
for this week to be productive.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.054
"How to be a better 'we." Hmm.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.846
Okay. No, no. Here we go.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.346
"Begin to see yourselves as more

19:47.436 --> 19:52.055
"than what you have allowed yourself
to believe that you can be."

19:52.858 --> 19:55.099
"Begin to see yourselves as more"...
Yeah, it's...

19:55.194 --> 19:58.607
We're not afraid of what we can't do.
We're actually afraid of what we can do.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.983
It's about individual power.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.405
Just read the full description.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.575
You just read the headlines. Read
the description. You might like it.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.495
Su, the whole point of this was
to disconnect from the Internet,

20:07.581 --> 20:09.993
and you brought
the Internet with us.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.075
What is this hippie crap?

20:12.169 --> 20:13.489
You have a crystal
in your pocket.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.420
I like the crystal.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.623
I like the way that
it feels in my hand.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.251
Hey, su, come on.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.213
You don't have to be
responsible for every moment.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.809
I'm sure it's fine.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.466
Well,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.473
must be some bad wood.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.517
Okay.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.811
Next time.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.566
The frogs are croakin'.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.277
Mmm-hmm.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.619
Thank you. Mmm.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.455
You can see the whole
dome of the universe.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.207
Hmm. Whoa!

21:40.216 --> 21:42.207
Did you see that?
A shooting star.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.507
Yeah.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.209
Wow!

21:45.304 --> 21:46.589
Oh! Jack: Oh, my god.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.462
Su: Another one.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.888
Wow. Whoa!

21:49.975 --> 21:52.136
Jack: What? Wow.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.934
Is it normal?

21:54.522 --> 21:56.979
Maybe it's a meteor shower.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.933
I saw this once in Vermont.
I was high on acid.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.898
The urge to take out my phone
right now

22:03.989 --> 22:05.445
is very strong.

22:05.533 --> 22:10.027
I've been wanting to YouTube how to
make a trap to catch a rabbit so bad.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.404
But I'm exercising self-control.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.907
You wanna murder a rabbit?

22:17.086 --> 22:18.371
You wanna see it die?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.043
No, I... no.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.918
I want to learn how to
humanely trap a rabbit.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.588
Who are you?

22:28.597 --> 22:29.803
Jack: Whoa.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.175
Su: Whats...

22:34.812 --> 22:36.222
Did that one hit the earth?

22:40.442 --> 22:41.442
Oh, no.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.983
What? No more.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.398
What?

22:45.656 --> 22:46.941
It was just you get...

22:47.616 --> 22:49.857
You always get your sleep
visions when you drink,

22:49.952 --> 22:51.362
and we're in a new place.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.533
Yeah, but I want more.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.294
What's happening?

23:07.136 --> 23:08.296
Get out!

23:09.013 --> 23:10.013
Get out of here!

23:10.097 --> 23:12.338
Oh, my god, Jackie,
nothing's there.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.010
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

23:14.476 --> 23:15.476
Su: You're asleep.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.971
No, I'm not. I'm not asleep.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.222
Yes, you are. You're asleep.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.054
No, I'm not a spider man.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.348
Oh, okay.
Spider covered in spiders.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.062
It's okay, just...

23:24.403 --> 23:25.403
You're okay.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.065
Man covered in spider string.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.530
It's okay. Trying to eat me.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.735
Yeah.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.645
Oh. Uh... oh.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.062
What? My sandal.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.585
Okay.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.041
So now we'll close our eyes

24:26.131 --> 24:28.087
and just feel each other.

24:28.759 --> 24:29.999
Oh. Okay.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.626
No, not feel me up.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.804
Feel with your brain.
Brain. Sorry.

24:46.694 --> 24:47.754
Well, with your eyes closed,

24:47.778 --> 24:49.689
you can really hear
all of nature's sounds.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.728
Shh. Yes. Shh.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.324
Shh.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.409
Okay, open.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.629
So calm.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.124
Yeah. What a gift.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.921
Yeah.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.502
What do you think
your gifts are?

25:18.100 --> 25:20.432
What? I was just wondering, um,

25:20.602 --> 25:23.639
'cause I was thinking about
my gifts the other day...

25:23.731 --> 25:26.097
Wait, no, su,
I know what this is.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.771
My gifts are
I'm good with animals,

25:29.945 --> 25:31.481
I'm a great listener,

25:32.114 --> 25:33.229
I'm fast.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.723
Have you been doing
an Internet list

25:34.783 --> 25:36.023
this entire time?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.233
Su, that's the opposite
of authentic.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.449
Well, you're being
the opposite of open-minded.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.035
Oh. Well, I think
that you're doing it wrong.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.582
You've just replaced your phone

25:45.669 --> 25:46.669
with a notebook.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.454
I just think, su, that you
need to learn how to relax.

25:54.636 --> 25:55.636
Whoo!

25:55.721 --> 25:57.461
This is relaxing!

26:00.142 --> 26:01.302
Where are you going?

26:02.144 --> 26:04.806
I'm gonna go bake a loaf
of bread and eat it!

26:06.565 --> 26:07.896
On!

26:09.735 --> 26:11.020
Jack!

26:11.195 --> 26:12.195
Wait!

26:12.571 --> 26:13.571
God.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.026
Okay.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.536
"Focus on the present moment."

26:22.706 --> 26:23.946
That's what you've been saying.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.518
"Practice listening
to your body."

26:25.542 --> 26:26.542
Gross.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.450
Su: "Goon an
adventure together."

26:28.629 --> 26:30.961
Jack: That sounds
like a tinder profile.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.192
Su: "Acknowledge your gifts.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.501
"Practice gratitude.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.082
"Do things for others."

26:35.177 --> 26:37.088
I don't really think
we should be using the list

26:37.179 --> 26:38.339
ds a weapon.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.930
Why won't you just do the gifts?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.907
Can you think of a thing
you're gifted at?

26:45.062 --> 26:46.097
Jack.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.349
Jack.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.726
What is that?

26:51.527 --> 26:52.847
Has this been here
the whole time?

26:53.695 --> 26:55.731
The pouffe? Yeah.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.271
I don't know. Probably.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.927
Su: I don't think people
are going around

26:58.951 --> 27:00.311
putting pouffes
in people's cabins.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.246
Jack!

27:03.330 --> 27:05.537
Can you focus on your
gifts for one second?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.614
I floss

27:07.709 --> 27:08.789
and parents love me.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.104
Su: Let's do "be honest about
something you've never told anyone."

27:13.507 --> 27:14.542
Well, you know what?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.669
I just think that honesty's
best in small doses

27:16.844 --> 27:18.334
spread out over a lifetime.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.879
Okay, well, Jack,

27:21.974 --> 27:23.414
I feel like I never get
much from you

27:23.559 --> 27:25.049
outside the regular Jack stuff.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.301
What is wrong with
the regular Jack stuff?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.808
Well, I mean deeper stuff, Jack.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.350
Can you pass me the body wash?

27:32.442 --> 27:33.962
Yeah, which one?
It's the little green.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.146
Here you go. Ooh.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.318
What about this one?

27:37.573 --> 27:38.904
What are you really afraid of?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.398
Uh, I guess

27:40.492 --> 27:42.198
that I'm afraid of my own blood

27:42.286 --> 27:43.321
coursing through my body.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.569
Okay. Well,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.225
I'm afraid of our lives
getting stagnant.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.661
Why are you making up
problems that don't exist?

27:50.127 --> 27:51.287
I think they do exist.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.077
I'm not like you. I can't just

27:53.172 --> 27:55.128
sit around waiting
for life to happen to me.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.710
I want to achieve something
this week, okay?

27:58.093 --> 28:00.300
I lost my job for this week.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.282
Can you pass me the face wash?

28:02.306 --> 28:03.950
Which one is the face wash?
It's the orange one.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.589
Jack, acquaint yourself
with the soaps.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.424
None of them are labeled.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.738
We should be doubling
down on our work,

28:12.858 --> 28:14.189
not running away
from everything.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.483
You know what's authentic?

28:16.987 --> 28:18.773
What? A paycheck with benefits

28:18.864 --> 28:21.196
and having a goddamn
savings account.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.856
So you know,
that I have 37,000...

28:22.951 --> 28:24.907
Your bitcoin
does not count, Jack.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.194
I'm 30. My mom had three kids

28:27.289 --> 28:28.495
by the time she was my age.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.121
You're 34. What are you doing?

29:33.563 --> 29:35.394
No way.

31:03.737 --> 31:04.797
Woman on voicemail: Ethanol.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.632
Su's mom on voicemail: Ethanol? What?

31:06.656 --> 31:08.134
Su's mom: They're attracted
to ethanol?

31:08.158 --> 31:09.694
What is it? Is that a drink?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.202
No, just the Sherry.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.766
Woman: It's here.
I'll get it. Hang...

31:13.955 --> 31:16.071
Su's mom: Hi, surina.
Are you watching this?

31:16.166 --> 31:18.452
Those rats in New York?
They're not rats.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.163
They're not rats, su.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.373
They're talking about it
on fox & friends.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.749
Jeez, mom.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.919
Su's mom: Hi, su. When did
you decide to go away?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.385
Okay, let's do this.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.353
What? Turn on our phones?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.646
What? No, definitely not.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.394
I wanna do the list.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.309
Oh. Yeah.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.853
I thought about
my one honesty thing

31:47.948 --> 31:49.688
that I've never
told anyone before.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.990
Really?
Yeah, and I agree with you.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.639
Like, we should be
productive about this week

31:54.663 --> 31:55.698
and stop fucking around.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.825
Okay. I don't want there
to be any secrets

31:57.916 --> 31:58.996
between us, su.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.412
Jack, I'm sorry...
Just... I refu...

32:01.586 --> 32:03.272
Before you say anything,
can I just, um, say

32:03.296 --> 32:04.411
what I have prepared?

32:05.132 --> 32:06.372
Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.675
Thank you.

32:10.512 --> 32:11.922
I don't know how to be a man.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.391
Okay.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.091
You know how my dad
is really great at man stuff?

32:18.395 --> 32:19.680
Like, he can catch a fish

32:19.771 --> 32:21.432
and get the hook out
of a fish's mouth

32:21.523 --> 32:23.000
when it's still wobbling
on the ground,

32:23.024 --> 32:25.686
and then gut it and then
feed it to the whole family.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.608
My brothers, they
picked up on that stuff,

32:27.696 --> 32:29.277
and they all know
basic plumbing.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.524
And it's like, I don't know

32:30.615 --> 32:32.321
how to get the hook out
of a fish's mouth,

32:32.409 --> 32:34.115
and I don't know
anything about plumbing.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.618
Jack, you're good at...
No, just... I'm trying to...

32:36.746 --> 32:37.781
And um...

32:37.873 --> 32:40.489
Look, I know that that's
all bullshit masculinity,

32:40.667 --> 32:43.955
and I never wanted to be
that type of guy anyway.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.912
So I sort of hid behind
this idea of a modern man

32:47.007 --> 32:49.464
so I wouldn't have to do
that type of guy stuff,

32:49.551 --> 32:53.385
but I'm not good
at the new stuff either.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.053
Yeah, I can cook. I can cook.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.590
But I can't tell
if a bathroom is dirty,

32:58.768 --> 33:01.851
and I am such a bad listener.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.855
And, like, I know that when
you want to talk about stuff

33:04.941 --> 33:06.806
and get honest,
I just shut down,

33:06.902 --> 33:08.767
and I retreat inward,
and I get so silent,

33:08.862 --> 33:09.862
but that's just because

33:09.946 --> 33:11.527
I hate the sound
of my own voice.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.855
It is so pathetic.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.823
God, that felt so good. You go.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.284
What?

33:18.371 --> 33:20.407
Yeah. It doesn't have
to be big like mine.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.205
It could be
a small confession or...

33:22.375 --> 33:24.240
It feels so good
to get it off your chest.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.576
I think you should go.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.001
Um...

33:27.172 --> 33:28.708
A confession? Yeah.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.338
I mean, we both
have to do it, right?

33:30.425 --> 33:31.665
Yeah, of course.

33:32.594 --> 33:36.758
I just can't think
of anything right now.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.463
What's like the last thing

33:38.558 --> 33:40.478
that you weren't completely
honest with me about?

33:41.311 --> 33:42.892
The last thing?
Yeah, the last thing.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.765
The last thing...

33:44.856 --> 33:46.471
Anything, honestly. Big, small.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.272
I mean, it could be
so fucked up.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.443
I eat my contacts.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.780
What?

33:53.823 --> 33:56.860
Every two weeks,
I eat my contacts.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.072
When I change to a new pair,

33:58.161 --> 33:59.401
I eat the old ones.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.657
Your contact lenses?

34:01.748 --> 34:02.748
Yeah.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.748
Why?

34:04.834 --> 34:08.246
I don't know. Ll've had
contacts forever,

34:08.338 --> 34:09.873
and I didn't always do that.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.375
I just wanted
to eat them one night.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.214
And now I can't stop.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.791
Su, this is so bad.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.502
Yeah, it's actually something
I'm really scared of,

34:17.597 --> 34:18.741
'cause, like,
that can't be good for...

34:18.764 --> 34:20.630
Whoa! What the hell?

34:21.351 --> 34:22.351
What?

34:22.435 --> 34:24.891
A critter just flew by so fast.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.606
A critter? What, like a...
Like a fox or a squirrel?

34:30.777 --> 34:32.141
I guess like a hedgehog.

34:33.612 --> 34:34.944
What does a hedgehog look like?

34:35.657 --> 34:36.967
You know like when
Sonic the hedgehog

34:36.992 --> 34:38.857
is in his small,
little ball going so fast?

34:40.954 --> 34:42.194
Did it look like a rat?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.322
No, it was too big and too fast.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.532
Jesus.

34:52.172 --> 34:53.172
I'm sure it's fine.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.553
Give me that one. Okay.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.719
Thank you so much.
You're so sneaky.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.678
Come on, hey, come on, now.

35:09.566 --> 35:10.566
Okay.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.810
I don't feel like looking
at my phone at all right now.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.192
Maybe we should just
move out of New York.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.529
Uh-huh. Get a plot
of land somewhere.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.572
Sure. Start a restaurant.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.654
I wonder how much
land up here costs.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.244
You wanna buy property?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.798
Yeah, or we could do it
in Brooklyn, you know.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.032
Maybe that adds
to gentrification.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.583
I don't know. Okay, so upstate.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.035
Yeah, we'll do upstate.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.792
Who knows? Maybe in a year

35:34.883 --> 35:36.748
we start thinking
about having kids.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.299
Yeah, maybe in a year

35:38.386 --> 35:39.967
we could start actively trying.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.720
Yeah. Like you said,
we'll just start thinking

35:42.807 --> 35:44.172
about having kids.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.599
My baby's drunk.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.603
That's not true. I just have
a little bit of a buzz on.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.859
I'm so sorry.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.737
I did not want to do this.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.410
Unbelievable. I'm so sorry, su.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.202
I did not
envision this happening.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.116
I actually wanted you to win.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.211
Did you?

36:12.295 --> 36:13.455
I did.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.210
Okay, what is this?

36:18.843 --> 36:21.926
Just all this talk
about the future is...

36:22.097 --> 36:23.257
Jack: Oh, okay.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.631
Mortgage.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.925
Oh, my god. Yeah.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.554
401k.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.266
College fund.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.147
Jack: Let's have sex
on the unfinished puzzle.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.359
Su: Say something
about the stock market.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.111
Jack: Collateralized
debt obligation.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.989
Su: Not that. Jack: Not that?

37:09.102 --> 37:10.467
Mmm. What is it?

37:11.354 --> 37:12.754
Get out of here!

37:13.815 --> 37:16.272
You leave us alone.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.769
It's okay. Who is it?

37:17.861 --> 37:18.896
What is it?

37:19.612 --> 37:21.352
Jack: It's a lion. Su: Mmm-hmm.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.531
Okay.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.321
There's a lion looking at me!

37:24.492 --> 37:26.153
Su: No, it's okay. It's okay.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.409
Just come back to sleep.
Come back to...

37:28.496 --> 37:29.986
You stay away
from my girlfriend!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.161
Oh, that's very nice.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.249
You leave us alone.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.369
That's really manly. Thank you.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.959
There's a lion in our room.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.711
Yes. Yeah.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.752
There's a lion trying to eat me.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.254
Trying to eat my girlfriend.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.760
Mmm.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.990
I'm feeling pretty good
about stuff.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.201
Su: Can you make breakfast?

38:14.292 --> 38:16.203
Like one of your
really good breakfasts?

38:16.294 --> 38:17.294
Jack: Mmm.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.710
You want a really
good one now, huh?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.379
Yeah. Yeah?

38:22.550 --> 38:25.087
Okay. I got you, soup.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.252
Yes!

38:29.390 --> 38:31.676
We did a really good job
with that puzzle.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.394
Wait, what the fuck?

38:37.857 --> 38:39.188
What?

38:39.359 --> 38:40.895
What happened to my starter?

38:41.903 --> 38:43.439
Did you bake it all yesterday?

38:43.530 --> 38:44.645
Did I bake it all? What?

38:44.739 --> 38:46.980
No, I've been cultivating
this for six months.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.191
Did I bake it all?
I would never. Jesus.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.822
Are there raccoons around here?

38:56.125 --> 38:57.581
Did we drink all the whiskey?

38:58.378 --> 38:59.788
No, there's plenty left.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.043
Did we spill it?

39:01.798 --> 39:02.833
God.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.590
Jack: I can't believe these
little fuckers ate it all!

39:06.678 --> 39:08.259
Jesus! They licked it clean.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.617
You know what? Maybe Blake still
has some of the offspring.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.007
Oh, I fucking bet
he didn't feed it.

39:14.602 --> 39:15.637
God.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.393
My starter. What...

39:31.202 --> 39:32.863
Jack: What does that?

39:34.497 --> 39:36.658
Is there ethanol
in sourdough starter?

39:38.835 --> 39:40.291
What are you talking about?

39:43.298 --> 39:44.538
Su?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.170
Hey.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.843
Did you move the pouffe?

39:52.098 --> 39:53.963
No. Do you want me
to move it back by...

39:54.058 --> 39:55.844
No, no, no. Don't touch it.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.801
Jack: Okay.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.556
Su: I think maybe...

40:00.857 --> 40:02.222
That's not just a pouffe.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.985
Yeah, I guess I don't really
know what a pouffe is.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.228
What? It's like an ottoman.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.403
Like a furry footstool.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.902
Okay, I thought maybe it was
more like a decorative pouffe.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.137
What's a decorative pouffe?
What do you mean?

40:13.161 --> 40:14.617
I do not know.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.242
Jack: Okay,
what do you think it is?

40:20.501 --> 40:21.786
I don't know.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.661
Okay. Yeah, just...

40:24.839 --> 40:25.874
Su: No.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.042
No. Jesus.

40:31.888 --> 40:32.968
Okay.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.777
Oh, my god.
What the fuck was that?

40:53.952 --> 40:57.489
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.197
No, seriously, what was that?

41:01.292 --> 41:02.657
That was not like
a normal animal.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.120
I need to tell you something,

41:04.212 --> 41:06.203
and you have to promise
not to be mad at me.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.996
What? Wait, what? Su?

41:08.257 --> 41:09.588
Let me secure everything.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.210
Jack: Secure everything?
What is happening?

41:16.683 --> 41:17.683
God.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.891
Su, what is happening?

41:21.062 --> 41:22.097
Oh, my god.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.644
Su? Su? Okay. Uh-huh?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.062
Hi. Hi.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.064
What is happening? Okay.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.141
So, yesterday I was mad,

41:29.237 --> 41:30.477
and then, then...

41:30.571 --> 41:32.132
My mom, she was
talking about these rats.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.356
Your mom? And I thought it was
the usual crap because...

41:34.867 --> 41:35.947
What are you talking about?

41:35.994 --> 41:36.994
I turned my phone on.

41:37.996 --> 41:38.996
What?

41:39.122 --> 41:40.562
I know, but it was
just for a second.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.409
Listen... you broke the pact.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.698
Okay, yeah. I know.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.041
But, Jack, listen to me.
And you lied to me.

41:46.129 --> 41:47.929
Well, technically,
I just omitted information.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.503
Jack: That is the same.
Okay, Jack.

41:49.674 --> 41:51.505
There were these
voicemails from my mom.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.487
I thought she was just
talking about, like,

41:53.511 --> 41:54.842
fox news or whatever,

41:54.929 --> 41:58.421
but she kept saying that these
rats were taking over the city

41:58.558 --> 42:00.640
and, like, something
about ethanol.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.308
And it's just... what?

42:02.478 --> 42:04.343
I don't know. I didn't
listen to all of it.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.521
But isn't it just a little weird

42:06.607 --> 42:08.893
we see this freaky little
creature all of a sudden,

42:08.985 --> 42:11.021
and then the whiskey
and the sourdough?

42:11.195 --> 42:12.935
That's ethanol stuff, right?

42:13.031 --> 42:14.237
What are you saying?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.572
I don't know,

42:16.659 --> 42:18.820
but we need to turn
our phones back on.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.072
We have to find out. No! No, su.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.407
No.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.704
Okay, you're right.
Yeah, let's get back online.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.313
Okay, okay, okay. Okay

42:53.404 --> 42:54.735
Jack: Okay su: Oh.

42:56.157 --> 42:57.442
Ohl

43:02.747 --> 43:03.782
Thank you.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.198
Whoa. What?

43:07.376 --> 43:08.786
I got three more voicemails now

43:08.878 --> 43:09.878
and a bunch of texts.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.294
What about you? No signal.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.547
Come on. Oh, yeah.

43:14.675 --> 43:15.960
I don't have a signal either.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.875
God, no messages. Nothing.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.011
What? It's just if...

43:21.557 --> 43:22.826
If you would have told me
yesterday, then maybe

43:22.850 --> 43:24.215
I'd have all my
messages too, su.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.056
Okay, whatever. It's just...

43:27.605 --> 43:29.186
What, um, what do
your messages say?

43:29.273 --> 43:31.013
Okay. Francis.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.228
"Where are you guys?
Are you seeing this?

43:33.319 --> 43:34.934
"They're infesting all the bars.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.571
"Brooklyn is fucked.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.817
"Let us know that
you guys are okay, okay?"

43:39.408 --> 43:40.568
What the fuck?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.108
Oh. Kate.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.034
"Everyone's assembling
at yankee stadium.

43:44.288 --> 43:47.280
"Wait, no. Don't go there.
It's been destroyed."

43:49.752 --> 43:52.869
Em. "Can I come over?
Julian is dwad."

43:55.174 --> 43:56.254
Oh, dead.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.296
"I don't know what to do."

43:59.470 --> 44:01.051
Oh, shit.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.387
Oh, my god. Julian.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.099
What do the voicemails say?

44:07.478 --> 44:09.764
Uh... yeah. Right.

44:10.898 --> 44:13.514
Su's mom on voicemail: Hi, su.
When did you decide fo go away?

44:13.693 --> 44:14.853
You didn't tell me that.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.813
They're saying
these big rats from Brazil

44:16.904 --> 44:18.144
have gotten into New York

44:18.239 --> 44:19.854
and are causing a lot of damage.

44:20.032 --> 44:23.445
Very dangerous, su!
Anyway, listen.

44:23.536 --> 44:25.868
Can you please have a think
about Thanksgiving?

44:25.955 --> 44:28.662
Because the flights are gonna
start getting expensive, okay?

44:28.958 --> 44:30.698
Bye! Oh, my god. It's
fucking June, mom.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.375
Okay. Next one.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.495
Su's mom: Hi, surina.
Are you watching this?

44:35.590 --> 44:37.876
Those rats in New York,
they're not rats!

44:38.050 --> 44:39.415
They're not rats, su.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.088
They're talking about it
on fox & friends.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.219
Unbelievable.
They're some kind of alien.

44:44.307 --> 44:45.513
Would you believe it?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.799
Extraterrestrials all over the world.
Aliens?

44:47.977 --> 44:50.537
Gene saw one in his backyard. Shit.
I didn't listen to this part.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.011
Hang on. Carol's calling me.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.471
I'll call you back. Bye, bye.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.272
That's it. That's the end.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.644
I mean, we're toast. Aliens, su.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.567
Su: Jack, just stop it.
There's more.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.174
Woman: Ethanol.
Su's mom: What? Ethanol?

45:00.198 --> 45:01.688
Woman: They're attracted
to ethanol.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.318
Su's mom: They're attracted
to ethanol?

45:03.409 --> 45:04.774
What is it? Is that a drink?

45:04.952 --> 45:07.159
Woman: No, just the Sherry.
It's here. I'll get it.

45:07.330 --> 45:08.330
Hang on, hang on.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.325
Surina, hello? Are you there?

45:10.416 --> 45:12.031
Pick up if you're there.
Pick up.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.909
Okay, I love you.

45:15.338 --> 45:17.124
I'm going to Carol's. Bye.

45:18.466 --> 45:20.297
I just ignored her.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.499
I didn't even...

45:22.553 --> 45:24.464
I just thought she was like
a crazy person.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.796
I didn't even try to...

45:26.974 --> 45:29.431
Hey, hey. I'm sure it's okay.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.683
That's the last voicemail
I have from her.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.810
Okay, and who are the other
voicemails from?

45:37.777 --> 45:39.142
Um, Raph.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.148
Your mom... okay, play them.
Play them.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.406
Okay.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.132
Raph on voicemail:
Sorry, making a smoothie.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.031
Listen, shit's getting weird
here in New York,

45:53.125 --> 45:54.603
so I'm gonna come
up there to the cabin

45:54.627 --> 45:56.663
and chill with you guys
till this thing rides out.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.169
Sorry to crash your vibe. Peace.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.625
When is that message from?

46:01.300 --> 46:02.710
Um, yesterday at 1:30 P.M.

46:02.802 --> 46:04.167
Fuck!

46:04.720 --> 46:06.210
Okay, next one, next one.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.825
Jack's mom on voicemail: Hey, su. I'm
trying to get in touch with Jack,

46:08.849 --> 46:10.202
and so we tried you,
but it sounds like

46:10.226 --> 46:12.308
you two have the same
ridiculous voicemail.

46:13.062 --> 46:14.498
Anyway, we just wanted
to let you know

46:14.522 --> 46:15.728
that we loaded up the boat,

46:15.898 --> 46:17.000
and we're gonna be
out on the water

46:17.024 --> 46:18.480
until all of this blows over.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.271
Now, dad has stored up
six weeks of canned food,

46:21.362 --> 46:22.943
so don't worry about us.
All right?

46:23.030 --> 46:24.440
He's got everything
under control.

46:24.532 --> 46:26.132
Listen, if you get this
in the next hour,

46:26.158 --> 46:28.365
we can come pick you up
at any port. All right?

46:29.328 --> 46:30.989
Hope you get this. Bye.

46:31.414 --> 46:32.904
What time's that from?

46:33.082 --> 46:35.698
5:35 P.M. yesterday.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.582
Fuck. Okay.

46:38.004 --> 46:39.289
Yeah. Uh...

46:41.132 --> 46:42.747
Okay. All right.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.257
Raph on voicemail: I'm probably
just leaving a message

46:45.344 --> 46:46.800
for two dead people right now.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.302
We're all gonna die anyway.

46:50.057 --> 46:51.467
So, I'm coming.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.883
My grandfather's gun is
in a chest in the basement.

46:53.978 --> 46:56.765
The code is...
70, when penicillin was invented.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.376
Have it ready for me.
Get away from it!

46:58.441 --> 47:00.181
No, it'll close up. Su: Okay.

47:00.609 --> 47:01.894
We could've got out.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.429
Su: Okay, well, maybe we're
getting ahead of ourselves here.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.316
Aliens, su!

47:06.490 --> 47:07.855
I'm sorry,
but you had ample time

47:07.950 --> 47:09.136
to tell me about this yesterday,

47:09.160 --> 47:10.570
and we could have escaped.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.742
We could be on a fucking
boat right now.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.473
Okay, well, what are we
even doing here?

47:14.540 --> 47:15.780
It's like, your friend's cabin.

47:15.916 --> 47:19.158
I didn't know there were gonna be aliens
on planet earth. There's aliens inside...

47:19.337 --> 47:21.419
Jack: Let's not argue.
It's not helpful to argue.

47:21.547 --> 47:23.879
You are arguing. I'm just
trying to voice my opinion,

47:23.966 --> 47:25.402
and you were starting
to argue with me.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.166
Okay, fine.
Let's just both shut up.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.751
Yeah, you're right. Okay.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.383
Yes, just chill and...

47:32.725 --> 47:34.761
Let's just think
about this for a second.

47:38.814 --> 47:39.974
Okay.

47:40.775 --> 47:44.063
I think we should go into
town, try to get cell service,

47:44.653 --> 47:47.486
and then we'll call your parents
and meet them by the water.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.154
Okay.

47:49.575 --> 47:53.033
Don't you think it would be safer if
we stayed here and, you know, hide?

48:05.341 --> 48:06.831
Okay, okay, okay.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.421
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

48:13.516 --> 48:15.427
What, the car won't start?
Come on!

48:15.976 --> 48:17.011
It's out of gas.

48:17.186 --> 48:18.926
We just put $30 into the tank.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.646
This is an emergency alert.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.357
Take shelter
and stay tuned for updates.

48:28.531 --> 48:31.022
God.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.448
Is there ethanol in gas?

48:35.162 --> 48:36.868
I don't know these things, su.

48:37.248 --> 48:40.456
No, windows up. Windows up!
Definitely do not get out of the car!

48:41.210 --> 48:42.620
Oh, my god.

48:54.515 --> 48:58.633
Okay. Su, I need you to be a little bit
more focused on safety right now, okay?

48:58.727 --> 49:01.184
Jack, it drank the gas.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.648
Oh, god. Oh, my god.

49:09.071 --> 49:10.311
Okay.

49:10.406 --> 49:15.275
Okay. Yeah, so, I guess
that we just stay put, yeah?

49:15.453 --> 49:16.738
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

49:16.912 --> 49:18.448
Yes. Uh-huh.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.489
Uh, we have about three
days' worth of food.

49:21.584 --> 49:24.747
It seems like the place that people
would want to escape to, yeah? So...

49:24.920 --> 49:26.251
Yeah. Yeah.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.162
Okay. Rar

49:28.340 --> 49:29.705
food,

49:29.884 --> 49:31.044
shelter,

49:31.218 --> 49:32.583
and we have a gun
in the basement.

49:34.013 --> 49:36.800
No, no, no, no, no, su.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.340
Okay? No, I'm not adding
a gun to the situation.

49:39.435 --> 49:41.551
There's already enough
danger as it is. No gun.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.061
I can't, I cannot do that.
Can't do that.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.104
Jack. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.020
Jack, I know. Trust me, I know.
The presence of a gun.

49:49.111 --> 49:53.525
Having a gun in the home increases the
probability of one of us being shot.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.735
I hate guns too.
The statistics...

49:55.826 --> 49:57.566
If I so much as pick up a gun,

49:57.745 --> 50:00.657
I'm more likely to shoot you
than anything else in the house.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.992
I know, Jack.
I know the statistics.

50:03.167 --> 50:06.659
You're 11 times more likely to kill
yourself than any external threat.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.665
Exactly.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.204
No guns.

50:11.634 --> 50:12.919
No gun.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.302
It's just that we might need
to use the gun. No, no.

50:17.473 --> 50:19.088
No, no, no.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.178
Like if

50:23.187 --> 50:27.021
aliens are coming toward us,

50:27.358 --> 50:28.814
a gun might stop them.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.484
Okay.

50:37.284 --> 50:38.615
We're gun people.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.448
No. We are gun people now.

50:48.879 --> 50:51.416
Raph: My grandfather's gun is
in the chest in the basement.

50:51.590 --> 50:54.252
The code is...
70, when penicillin was invented.

50:54.343 --> 50:55.423
Have it ready for me.

50:55.511 --> 50:57.172
Man: Get away from it!
No, it'll close up.

50:58.722 --> 51:02.840
It sounded like 19707 um...

51:03.811 --> 51:05.051
Orlike 1770.

51:05.229 --> 51:06.890
17777

51:07.064 --> 51:08.304
18707

51:08.482 --> 51:10.188
what was penicillin
the cure for?

51:10.693 --> 51:14.151
Yeah, I'm just gonna start at 1700.
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

51:18.617 --> 51:22.610
I just hope my mom's okay.
I wish I could call her.

51:22.788 --> 51:25.530
Su, you can't just think
about, yeah, right.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.323
1704.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.117
And the thing about, that's,
you know, 'cause, I mean...

51:30.296 --> 51:32.207
When you have parents... what?

51:32.298 --> 51:35.882
Just, um, I can't...
I can't do the code and talk.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.378
Yeah. There we go. Move over.

51:41.181 --> 51:43.263
So, let's not speculate.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.434
Right.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.804
What do we know?
What do we not know?

51:46.979 --> 51:49.186
Okay, what do we know?
What do we know?

51:49.273 --> 51:52.982
Well, we know that there are
aliens on planet earth.

51:54.153 --> 51:55.313
Jesus Christ.

51:55.404 --> 51:58.942
And we know that they look like
tiny, furry, little footstools,

51:59.033 --> 52:00.694
and that New York
has been evacuated,

52:00.784 --> 52:04.197
which means that other cities
have been evacuated as well.

52:07.249 --> 52:10.286
Look, we can't think about this in
terms of movies that we've seen

52:10.377 --> 52:14.495
because these are aliens from
another planet, not earth.

52:14.673 --> 52:17.881
So, it doesn't really make sense
to be talking in terms of wants

52:18.052 --> 52:20.714
because those are really
earth-based behaviors.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.804
Okay, wait. We have
to start somewhere.

52:25.476 --> 52:28.138
I don't think so. I think
we should start nowhere.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.689
I'm gonna start looking for
more stuff to make weapons.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.440
Wait, are you leaving this room?

52:35.611 --> 52:37.714
Yeah, I think there's more
weapony stuff in the basement.

52:37.738 --> 52:39.729
But, okay, just be careful.

52:39.907 --> 52:42.740
The pouffe is so fast
and sneaky.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.697
Right. Those are earth-based
attributes, but, yeah, okay.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.893
What the hell was that?
I dropped a flashlight.

54:01.363 --> 54:03.979
What are you doing?
I don't know. I don't know.

54:04.658 --> 54:05.943
I'm just...

54:06.118 --> 54:07.858
God.

54:08.036 --> 54:10.402
Can we not split up again?
It's just too scary.

54:10.581 --> 54:11.696
Yeah, sorry.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.616
Um, I got tape,
flashlight, a broom,

54:15.127 --> 54:16.708
and I think
we should use the wine.

54:17.504 --> 54:18.835
Use the wine?

54:19.006 --> 54:21.122
Yeah, as, like,
a distraction bomb.

54:21.759 --> 54:22.759
What?

54:22.843 --> 54:25.155
Okay, so, the pouffe is coming towards us.
We have the wine.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.545
We throw it very far away.
It shatters.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.504
The pouffe goes right
towards the wine.

54:32.686 --> 54:33.721
That's not a bad idea.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.473
It's pretty clever.

54:35.647 --> 54:36.762
Thanks, yeah. I mean...

54:37.816 --> 54:39.272
Just...

54:44.573 --> 54:45.938
The hinges aren't on.

54:46.825 --> 54:48.156
Looks like it could just...

54:48.702 --> 54:50.488
Oh. Bingo.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.240
Oh. Yes.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.031
We should test it.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.055
What are you doing?
Oh. Just protecting my ears.

55:14.436 --> 55:15.676
I think you should too.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.100
Just shoot the gun.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.521
Okay.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.645
God, this trigger's hard to...

55:26.824 --> 55:29.190
Su: Oh!

55:29.368 --> 55:30.858
Jack, are you...

55:31.620 --> 55:32.780
Yeah. Oh.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.577
Is there any in my hair?

55:34.748 --> 55:36.579
Uh, no, I think. Yeah. Cool.

55:36.750 --> 55:39.366
I think you're good.
How about on my body?

55:39.545 --> 55:40.876
You're good. Are you okay?

55:40.963 --> 55:42.078
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

55:44.967 --> 55:47.879
I hid the bullets, too,
in a separate place.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.638
Regardless of everything else,

55:54.184 --> 55:56.140
I'm glad we're on the
same page about guns.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.769
I'm starving.

56:00.399 --> 56:02.230
Me too.

56:02.401 --> 56:04.733
We should probably
ration though, right?

56:04.903 --> 56:05.938
Yeah.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.948
We should make go bags in case we
have to leave really suddenly.

56:11.118 --> 56:14.110
Right. Yeah, like passports
and birth certificates.

56:15.914 --> 56:19.532
Yeah, we don't have those. Okay, yeah.
Go bags. That's a good idea. Okay.

56:20.294 --> 56:26.130
Um, we have spaghetti squash,
microgreens, lamb chops, leftover quinoa.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.134
Would it have killed us to have
gotten some nonperishables?

56:35.642 --> 56:39.134
Okay, three, two, one.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.803
Gol

56:43.233 --> 56:45.440
hey! Hey. Hey.

56:46.111 --> 56:47.317
Aw, crap. Su: Oh, fuck!

56:47.487 --> 56:49.728
Shit! Hey.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.365
On the, hup.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.568
Hup!

56:53.535 --> 56:54.695
Get the ice!

56:59.207 --> 57:02.495
It won't close! It won't close!
It's okay. Let's go.

57:02.669 --> 57:06.036
All right. I'm here with the banana
bag, the duffel, the backpack.

57:06.924 --> 57:07.959
Good.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.384
Twenty-three seconds. Not bad.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.883
This seems like a lot of
stuff to carry on the run.

57:21.730 --> 57:23.095
Su: Okay, okay.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.393
Sean Connery. Jack: Mmm-hmm.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.184
What time are you
going to wimbledon?

57:29.905 --> 57:32.271
Oh. Uh...

57:34.868 --> 57:36.358
Oh, uh...

57:38.372 --> 57:40.237
I don't know.

57:42.084 --> 57:44.917
I was thinking about "ten-ish."

57:47.464 --> 57:48.544
That's a good one.

57:50.300 --> 57:53.042
Okay, Sean Connery. Mmm.

57:53.220 --> 57:58.681
What did Sean Connery say to
the hostage who had a beard?

57:59.226 --> 58:00.636
Mmm.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.267
I don't know.

58:03.438 --> 58:05.895
"I came here to 'shave' you."

58:11.279 --> 58:14.817
Is anyone going to "shave" us?

58:16.368 --> 58:18.825
Or are we gonna have
to "shave" ourselves?

58:21.707 --> 58:25.575
If it's as bad as it seems,
everything's gonna be different.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.872
Maybe I can be a part of the
team that rebuilds the Internet.

58:34.469 --> 58:35.504
Jackie.

58:36.638 --> 58:37.673
Yeah?

58:39.933 --> 58:41.798
We don't have any skills.

58:50.068 --> 58:51.774
Are you scared?

58:53.613 --> 58:54.898
A little bit.

58:56.116 --> 58:57.401
Me too.

58:57.576 --> 58:59.237
A little bit.

59:09.171 --> 59:10.911
You should go to sleep
for a bit.

59:11.089 --> 59:14.422
Mmm-mmm.
And abandon you? No way.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.339
I'm not even tired yet,
seriously.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.798
I'll wake you up when I'm tired,
and then you can keep watch.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.055
I love you, Jackie.

59:41.787 --> 59:43.948
I know they don't
look like us, Jack.

59:46.374 --> 59:50.117
But who's to say they won't
take better care of this place?

59:52.631 --> 59:54.041
Get out of here!

59:54.216 --> 59:55.752
Jack, it's okay.

59:55.926 --> 59:57.132
It's okay.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.009
Pouffe on the couch!

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.087
You stay away from us!

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.467
There's a pouffe on the couch!

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.554
What's happening?
Jack, we need to go.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.352
I need a minute. Jack, we need
to get out of here. Jack!

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.929
Run, Jack.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.814
Okay. Let's go!

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.690
Gol

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:18.028
okay. Okay. Come on. Come on.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.938
Wait, that was the pouffe,
wasn't it?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.732
Yeah, it was. It was. Nol

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.741
barn! Barn! Barn! Barn!

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:26.828
Jack: My god.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.994
My god, I just woke up!

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.419
Okay. Okay.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.589
Oh, my god. Okay. Okay.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.143
Keys?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.601
Keys. Keys.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.769
Carl

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:56.861
yeah.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:58.063
Car! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.978
Okay. Keys here.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.072
No hole!

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.989
No hole! No hole! No hole.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.322
You have to put the clutch in.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.912
Ah! It's stick shift? It's stick.
You can't drive a stick?

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.077
â Can you?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.423
My boyfriend in college taught
me once, but it was once.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.675
I don't know. I'm not very good.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.008
I don't know! Okay.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.093
Oh, my god. Yeah.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.349
All right.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.686
Put the clutch in.
Turn the engine...

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.849
Okay?

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.483
Whoa

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.133
right. You have to
keep the clutch in.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.110
Go, go, go, go. Su, su!

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.738
Come on, come on.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.043
Go, go, go, go!

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.550
Go, go, go!
I'm going, I'm going!

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.006
Jack: Okay. Oh. Okay.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.671
Come on, su.
A little bit faster.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.807
Okay, this is as fast as it goes.
All right. Great.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.093
I'm going. I'm going.
I'm going. I'm going.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.807
Wait. The go bags.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.892
Jack: Goddamn it! The go bags.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.558
We can do this. Twenty-three seconds.
We got this.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:23.236
Su, the pouffe is in the cabin.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.193
Right. Okay, but let's just
forget the fridge stuff.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.678
Then we don't have to
go in the cabin.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:30.785
We have the go bags by the door with the
essentials. That's all we need. Okay?

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.912
Okay. Okay. Okay. So,
I'm gonna reverse.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.290
You're gonna actually go to
the woodpile and get the ax.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:37.355
I'm gonna go into the cabin,
get the grab bags by the door.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:38.981
We'll meet back in the car
and we'll reverse.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:43.089
Reverse, go to the woodpile, go back to the
door, get the go bags, get outside together.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.085
Are you listening or are you repeating?
Go to the ax...

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.469
Just one more time. Get the ax and, I'm
so sorry. What is it? One more time.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.480
Okay. I'll get the door.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:07.572
Su! Sul! What?

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.607
No, stop, stop.
Pouffe on the roof!

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.326
What? Pouffe on the roof!

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:27.293
It didn't drink the gas.
I don't see it. Is it clear?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.718
Jack: I don't know.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.379
Is it good?
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.389
Okay. Okay.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.015
Ohl

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.770
here. Gotcha.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:40.976
Let's go.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.940
Okay.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.030
Do you see any?

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.949
Oh! Oh!

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.740
What was that? It doesn't matter.
Let's just keep going.

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.579
Okay. Okay. Yeah? Okay.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.291
Hey-yo! Oh, god!

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.048
Jack: I'm not an expert, but don't you
think that we should be switching gears?

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:34.359
Damn it. I slept in my contacts.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.902
Wow, you didn't eat 'em?

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:39.117
Still no service?

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.825
No, no service.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.587
Hey, hey.
Hey, wait, what is that?

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:50.208
Oh, oh, oh.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.629
Oh, no.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.388
Wow.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.923
Oh, god, it's a pouffe.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:00.226
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.308
It sucked out the gas!
It sucked out the gas.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.938
It's a fluffer! Shoot it!

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:05.144
Holy shit.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.558
It's going right through it!

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.692
It's going straight through it.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.023
Man: Alice!

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.438
Oh, my god!

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.698
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.244
Jack: No, no, no.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.740
Oh! Shit, su.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.125
Oh, my god. Okay. Okay.
Reverse. Reverse.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.501
Come on. Oh, god. Okay.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.128
Ah! I can't get it!

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.959
Jack, what are you doing?

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:32.800
Su: Jack!

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.348
Holy shit.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:47.891
Ohl

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.454
Holy shit.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.373
It worked. It worked.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.784
Holy shit.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.001
Ohl

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.209
oh. Oh, god.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:15.797
It's in my mouth.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.712
Did it just pouffe us?

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.506
Oh!

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.596
Ohl

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.936
is it gone?

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.854
Yeah, drive. Hmm?

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.487
Jesus, that's a lot of blood.
Fuck.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:49.953
What was that?

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.298
That's a baby.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:01.632
That's definitely a
crying baby in the truck.

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:05.427
Okay, what if it wasn't a baby? What
if it was, like, a bird or something?

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:11.933
Under normal circumstances, you know, I
would help the baby out. You know I would.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:15.820
I just think that right now we should
be just full-blown selfish, yeah?

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:19.073
Jack, we can't be the people who left
the crying baby in the truck though.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.068
Well, maybe
we didn't hear it, right?

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:26.247
What if we just drove by and we
didn't even hear it, the baby?

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.455
Shit!

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:32.336
Oh, god. Aw, shit.

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.305
Shit, it's a baby.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.773
Should we just take it
or should we leave a note?

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.192
Well, I'd like to get the fuck
out of here as fast as possible.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:56.398
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.065
Okay, okay.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.283
Hi.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:09.991
Okay, we're gonna
get you out of here.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.998
Yes, we are. I got you.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:14.787
Can you help me
with the seat belt?

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.881
You're okay.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.042
It's okay.
Just, like, it's stuck.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.631
I don't know why. Okay.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.341
Aw. What the hell?

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.756
Should we, wait. Actually
should we just get him out?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.335
Su: Not worry about
the whole thing?

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.913
Jack: I'm trying to get
the whole thing out.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.897
Su: Okay, just take him out. Just take
him out. Jack: Is this a button or not?

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.433
Su: That's how you should do it.
Let me look for something.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.060
Jack: Why would it look like a
button if it's not a button?

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:40.116
It's like military grade.
Why would you make it...

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:43.733
I don't know.
It's stuck. What...

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.444
It's a diesel, isn't it?

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:48.662
A lady! Uh...

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.040
I'm gonna take the car, okay?

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.201
Okay, no, no, no...

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.415
There's six more bullets
left in this gun.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.339
Please don't take the car.
Please don't do this!

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.959
We don't know what we're doing!
You can't leave us here!

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.546
What about the baby?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.296
It's not my baby.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.555
Wait.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.236
What is happening?

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.277
We're fucked.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.703
I mean, we were fucked.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:32.957
And now we have no car
and a fucking baby.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.493
Where did she come from?
The woods?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.756
The go bags, Jack. Yeah.
What the fuck just happened?

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.082
I knew if we had the gun,
we would still have the car.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:46.095
Su, if we had a gun, she would have
shot us and then stolen the car.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.470
Ohl

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:51.975
is he okay?

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.769
Of course he's not okay.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.918
His parents are dead,
and he's stuck with us, Jack.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.102
You're okay.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.937
You're okay, little guy.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.443
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.861
Okay, let's just grab their shit

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.063
and let's go.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.405
Okay. Where?

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.191
I don't know.
The woods, the other way.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.780
Okay, yeah. Shit.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:11.571
Okay, come on. Still no service.

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:16.083
Okay, let's stay away
from houses and cars. Hi.

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:19.291
Okay, but hurry up because I think
we're kind of in a hot zone here.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:22.374
The car probably still
smells like ethanol. Bingo.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.135
Jack: I feel like I can
still smell the pouffe.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.603
My birth control was in the car.

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:42.310
Goddamn it.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.365
If we don't get rescued in the next
three days, I'm going to get my period.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:46.697
Is that how that works?

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:49.701
Instant noodles, electrolytes,

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.782
epinephrine.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:55.289
Huh. There's a birth certificate
for this little guy.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.575
Oh, my god.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:57.788
What? What is it?

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:01.708
Nol!

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:05.799
Baby Jack?

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.301
Baby Jack.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:10.800
We have two Jacks.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:16.726
On.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:20.482
Oh. I think baby Jack
shat himself.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:22.646
On.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.484
Do you know how to do it?

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.398
Uh, I guess so.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.319
Yeah. I mean,
it's not cricket science.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:33.952
Cricket?

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.535
Rocket science. Yeah.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.745
I changed my nephew
a couple of times.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.457
He peed on me once, so, I
learned my lesson there.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.963
You gotta keep your head back.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:48.001
Just put him on the ground or...

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.635
Changing mat.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:53.719
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Hi. There.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.555
Hi, baby Jack. Hi.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.971
Okay, baby Jack.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.561
Okay. There we go.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:07.904
Oh. What we got here?
A little snappy-snappies?

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:09.860
Yeah.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.817
Oh, okay. Here we are.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.328
Oh. Oh. You got
a little frown on, huh?

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.036
You little frowny guy.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.792
Can you grab his legs?
This is a two-person job.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.203
Sure. Yeah.

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:27.249
Oh! Okay. There we go.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.045
Whoa.

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:41.262
Litterbug.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.361
Jack: Oh.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.275
I think I need to sit down.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:56.531
Okay.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.413
Here we go.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:01.199
There we go.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.455
You're really pretty.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.795
I guess I feel pretty.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.382
I can't see you very well,

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.759
but I would say you look strong.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.640
Yeah.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.051
I feel strong.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:21.806
Good.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:30.694
I mean, this is what
we should have done all along.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:33.777
Had a baby, live in the wild and free.
Yeah. Baby.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:38.074
No burden of a job or society.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.532
Yeah!

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:41.538
Now we have...

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.830
Now we have a son. What?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.671
What? What did you say?

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.337
Do you want to meet
the officiant?

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:56.174
Su, this is reverend tree.
Reverend tree, su.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.515
He's marrying us.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.721
We're getting married?
Yeah, we are.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.103
We're getting married? Yes.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:09.688
Let us promise to always listen to
each other's thoughts and feelings

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.818
and to never lie.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:14.822
Especially when
it pertains to aliens.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.325
Okay. And let's just get jobs
and contribute to society.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:19.906
Let's rebuild the country.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.081
Just give me one second.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.205
Of course. Take your time.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.740
I don't need an answer
right now.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.158
That's when I told the guy,

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.997
"if you come around here
another time,

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:30.083
"you better shove that up your
ass, try to sell me a coconut."

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.049
Su, we have two... su, what is this?
Su, su, su!

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.505
Jack.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.469
Jack.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.222
Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.887
Come snug me. Jack.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:47.930
I'm gonna save you.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.354
Oh, I...

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.487
I got it. I got it.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.577
Wait now.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.739
Is that string cheese?
Don't fight me.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.704
I'm not fighting.
I like that stuff.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:13.960
"Remove... blue."

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.256
One,

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.137
two...

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:22.802
Three.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.070
Hmm.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:24.697
Ohl

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.910
su!

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.542
God. Su, su.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:32.952
Su.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.745
Su. What?

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.164
We've been drugged. Something happened.
What's happening?

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:39.584
What, you're stabbing me?
No, no. The pouffe.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.798
It pouffed us. We just gotta go.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:44.930
It's not very safe out
right now, okay? Oh, no.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:48.184
I lost a contact.
It's not in my eye.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.140
Oh, shit. Goddamn it.

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:53.021
All my other contacts
are in the goddamn car.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:55.649
Hey. Whatever happened
to your glasses?

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.732
I didn't like the way they looked,
so I threw them in the garbage.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.571
Okay. Well, can you see at all?

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:04.108
Through one eye.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.194
Still no service.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.409
Su. What?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.866
Where's baby Jack?

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.000
Uh...

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.127
Jack!

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:24.345
Jack! I mean, he was here,
and then I was here.

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.722
And then he went...
We lost the baby.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.848
Of course we lost the baby.

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.010
I don't think he could've
gotten far, all right?

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:34.897
Yeah. Sure. We can't even take care
of ourselves, let alone a baby.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:38.480
We should've just left him in the car
for someone more capable to find him.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.019
Jack, we're idiots.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.404
We should be dead instead
of baby Jack's parents.

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:46.067
Su, I think you're just having a hard
time right now because we were poisoned.

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:48.907
No. The world is fucked!

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.163
And we should
stop pretending it's not.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:55.827
Okay, maybe if we just be
quiet, we can hear him.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:57.624
Okay?

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.303
We're gonna die out here!

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.756
Su, su, su, su, su, su.
No, no, no.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.346
We're not dying.
Hey, we're not dying.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.930
We're not dying.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:16.310
Let's just try to focus on
one thing, finding the baby.

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:18.190
Yeah? Focus with me.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.520
Okay?

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:37.288
Baby Jack!

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.922
Pouffe.

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:44.754
Su: Is it looking at us
or is it looking at him?

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.089
Okay.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:51.973
On the count of three,

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.226
you grab the knife,
and I'll grab the wine.

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:56.846
One...

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.059
Now!

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.693
Jack!

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.371
Jack.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:22.546
Su, the wine.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:24.752
Okay.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.584
Come on, su. Come here.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.730
Jack!

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.609
Jack!

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:47.946
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Oh, my god.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:49.698
Okay.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.199
Jack. Jack.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:56.874
Let go!

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.426
Get it off! What the fuck?

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.110
You okay?

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.317
No way.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.112
Oh! It's okay.

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:20.364
Oh, baby, I know.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.157
It's okay.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:23.416
Are you okay?

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.415
Yeah. I think so.

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:28.710
I mean, it almost killed me,
but I think so.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:34.844
You stepped between me
and the pouffe.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:37.131
Yeah. You shielded me.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.346
Well, you savagely murdered that
pouffe when it was attacking me.

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:45.560
I really... I didn't like it.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:48.396
I really didn't want to.
I don't like killing things.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.570
Yeah.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.605
Oh. Sorry. I can't stop shaking.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.114
It's okay.

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.149
I'm shaking too. Jesus.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.990
We're chock-full
of epinephrine right now.

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.284
I think we're
close to the trail.

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.136
I think we should just
keep going up that hill.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:15.669
What, do you love me
or something?

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.058
What... what is epinephrine?

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.764
I don't know.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.792
Is that the lookout?

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:05.594
It really is a hice view, huh?

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.099
Here.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.206
We were here
just a few days ago.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.831
Three days ago.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:34.715
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.170
Oh, I don't think it matters

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.126
who we are anymore.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:39.882
Yeah?

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.468
Right?

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.060
Yeah?

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.443
Oh, there's a thingy.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:02.151
Wait, su, there's
something over there.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.455
Was that there before?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.959
Su: Huh.

01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.372
What is that?

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.929
Ah, um...

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.056
Just looking. Su?

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:31.062
I'm just looking. Su.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:59.508
What is she doing?

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.336
Yeah, what's she doing?

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.596
Okay, we're touching it.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:13.309
I can't.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.274
There's like a...

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.106
Like a force field.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.772
Great. Well, maybe we don't touch it.
You know, it's not safe.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.986
What's safe now, Jack?

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.575
Okay.

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.241
Let's touch the thing.

01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:56.143
Cool.

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:03.038
Jack: Is it a communication
tower or something?

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.112
Look, it just keeps going
down into the ground.

01:26:07.954 --> 01:26:09.819
Phone? Phone!

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.579
It's me. It's me. Phone!

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:12.990
Phone!

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.328
Yes! Yeah?

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.063
Yes, come on. No!
Oh, my god. Who is it?

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:18.374
What is it? It won't pick up.
It's totally busted.

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:21.255
It won't answer.
Check yours. Check yours.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:22.426
Yeah. It's on.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:25.051
Ah! We gotta have signal.

01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:27.338
Oh, my god. Yeah, so many texts.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:28.516
Yeah.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.049
Oh, my god.

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:31.143
Holy shit.

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:32.343
Oh, my god.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:33.889
Okay, go to CNN.

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:36.180
Okay. All right.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:37.855
Man:
I'm standing in the center...

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:38.943
What is it?

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.171
Of what used to be Johannesburg.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.901
What? What is that?

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.233
Go to Twitter.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.736
What? This isn't real.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:48.195
What is happening?

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.366
This can't be real.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.529
Go to Facebook.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:09.306
Fuck. Oh, shit.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:10.964
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:12.633
Jack: Oh, my god.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:15.427
No. Oh, shit.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:16.765
Help!

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:17.940
Help!

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:24.190
Help!

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.441
Jack: We're in a pouffe trap.

01:27:25.532 --> 01:27:27.318
We're in a fucking pouffe trap!

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.153
Jack. Wait. Su, su, the phone.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:32.069
Oh, my god, yes. Wait, let me call...

No, I don't wanna worry her.

Automated voice:

We're somewhere

And we have a baby.
We found him, baby Jack.

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:58.144
And we're in a pod.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:01.682
It's some alien trap of some
sort, and we can't get out!

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:05.019

Everything's fine. I'm sorry.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:22.479
Mmm-hmm. It's okay.

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:25.023
Are you having trouble
