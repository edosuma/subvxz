Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.585 --> 00:04.668
Bonnie: The other side
is collapsing,

00:04.670 --> 00:06.700
and everyone in it
is going away.

00:06.701 --> 00:07.900
We need to start
the spell again.

00:07.902 --> 00:09.068
We can't. That was
our one shot.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.453
But Damon's
on the other side.

00:10.455 --> 00:12.558
The spell the Travelers
cast across Mystic Falls

00:12.559 --> 00:14.059
eliminates spirit magic.

00:14.061 --> 00:15.693
Aah!

00:15.696 --> 00:17.195
Vampires can't get
into Mystic Falls?

00:17.197 --> 00:18.730
They can lurk
around the borders.

00:18.732 --> 00:20.315
Luke Parker has been
feeding Elena

00:20.317 --> 00:23.118
some concoction that allows her to
hallucinate Damon.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.287
Elena: The herbs,
they make me so thirsty.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.072
Aah!

00:27.074 --> 00:28.373
Please help me.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.908
Caroline: Stefan
didn't say good-bye.

00:29.910 --> 00:32.244
Damon and Bonnie died,
and he just left.

00:32.246 --> 00:33.779
Elena: I need you to tell me
that you're gonna find Damon

00:33.781 --> 00:35.130
and bring him back
because I don't think

00:35.132 --> 00:36.748
I can live forever
without him.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.417
Stefan: I can't
I gave up.

00:38.419 --> 00:39.918
I moved on.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.636
I want you to
take away Damon.

00:41.638 --> 00:43.088
I want you to compel
me to forget

00:43.090 --> 00:44.172
that I ever
loved him.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.758
[Rumbling]

00:46.760 --> 00:48.593
Do you think
it will hurt?

I don't know.

[Frogs croaking]

01:05.279 --> 01:06.778
Huh.

01:16.790 --> 01:20.375
That got awkward
fast. Ahem.

01:20.377 --> 01:21.793
What happened?

01:21.795 --> 01:23.428
Where is everybody?

01:26.967 --> 01:28.550
Where you going?

01:28.552 --> 01:30.135
Hey.

01:34.191 --> 01:37.159
Well, I feel a fang,
so I'm still a vampire.

01:37.161 --> 01:39.227
Either I'm a dead vampire,
or Mystic Falls

01:39.229 --> 01:40.896
is no longer magic-free.

01:40.898 --> 01:42.230
Look.

01:46.320 --> 01:49.287
I definitely blew that up
about an hour ago.

01:49.289 --> 01:50.989
Why don't we see
any people?

01:50.991 --> 01:52.374
If we're still
on the other side,

01:52.376 --> 01:54.159
we should at least be
able to see the living.

01:57.331 --> 01:59.164
Where the hell are we?

02:01.168 --> 02:03.668
And I don't mean
geographically.

02:06.557 --> 02:08.173
I have no idea.

02:17.184 --> 02:18.683
Matt: Jer, come on.
We're gonna be--

02:18.685 --> 02:23.021
Matt! Sorry. I--I needed
a place to crash.

02:23.023 --> 02:24.573
Jer said it was cool.

02:24.575 --> 02:26.191
This isn't Jer's house.

02:26.193 --> 02:28.076
Well, it's not
yours either.

02:28.078 --> 02:29.694
Look. It's
no big deal.

02:29.696 --> 02:31.746
I can just take off.

02:31.748 --> 02:33.915
Yeah. Why don't
you do that?

02:43.427 --> 02:44.876
Why would you
bring her here?

02:44.878 --> 02:46.845
You shouldn't be anywhere
near her, dumbass,

02:46.847 --> 02:48.213
not after what
happened yesterday.

02:48.215 --> 02:49.881
Caroline compelled
her to forget Elena

02:49.883 --> 02:51.216
attacked her.

02:51.218 --> 02:52.267
It's not a big deal.

02:52.269 --> 02:53.935
Not a big deal?

02:53.937 --> 02:56.771
Right. I forgot. You don't
care about anything.

02:56.773 --> 02:59.608
[Music playing]

03:13.140 --> 03:14.456
Hey.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.625
Hey!

03:16.627 --> 03:18.410
Uh, what are you doing?

03:18.412 --> 03:22.547
I mean, I thought
it'd be nice to--

03:22.549 --> 03:26.551
completely overstay
my welcome.

03:26.553 --> 03:29.588
I'm sorry.
I thought, uh--

03:29.590 --> 03:30.922
never mind
what I thought.

03:30.924 --> 03:33.341
No. I just wasn't
really expecting you

03:33.343 --> 03:37.095
to still be here, so...

03:37.097 --> 03:39.514
Right. So why should
you expect somebody

03:39.516 --> 03:42.267
you spent the night with
to make assumptions about breakfast?

03:42.269 --> 03:43.335
I'm gonna go.

03:43.337 --> 03:44.319
No, no, no, Ivy--

03:44.321 --> 03:46.104
Stefan, I get it.

03:46.106 --> 03:47.939
I am super into you,
you're...

03:47.941 --> 03:50.158
intermittently into me.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.277
Breakfast bad.

03:52.279 --> 03:53.328
Don't worry about it.

03:53.330 --> 03:56.331
Ivy.

03:56.333 --> 04:00.118
Look. Why don't we
have dinner tonight,

04:00.120 --> 04:02.287
although...

04:02.289 --> 04:05.373
I should probably
do the cooking.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.166
Elena, voice-over:
It's been 4 months.

05:21.168 --> 05:22.500
It's time for me
to let go.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.202
You gonna erase
Bonnie from your head, too.

05:24.204 --> 05:26.371
Missing Bonnie
makes me sad, Jer.

05:26.373 --> 05:29.708
Missing Damon makes
me dangerous.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.710
Alaric will compel
away any memories

05:31.712 --> 05:33.545
and then make me forget
that I had him do it.

05:33.547 --> 05:35.680
I need you to keep
the truth from me, too.

05:35.682 --> 05:37.132
Tyler and Stefan
are on board.

05:37.134 --> 05:38.683
What about Caroline?

05:38.685 --> 05:41.936
Somehow, I doubt she'll
take much convincing.

05:41.938 --> 05:43.888
You said that Stefan
was looking for a way

05:43.890 --> 05:45.223
to bring Bonnie
and Damon back.

05:45.225 --> 05:46.558
I thought he was.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.359
I've been feeding
him leads for months.

05:48.361 --> 05:50.061
He let me believe
he was following them.

05:50.063 --> 05:51.863
Well, I've been a little
focused on magic bubble duty,

05:51.865 --> 05:54.232
and as you can see by the
lack of magic in Mystic Falls,

05:54.234 --> 05:56.951
it's a spectacular
fail of a mission,

05:56.953 --> 05:59.070
and now you're telling me
that this whole time

05:59.072 --> 06:01.239
no one has been doing
anything to help

06:01.241 --> 06:03.208
Bonnie and Damon?

06:05.462 --> 06:07.979
I wouldn't exactly
say no one.

06:07.981 --> 06:10.815
[Music playing]

06:14.755 --> 06:16.921
Enzo: Come on.
Just a little hint.

06:16.923 --> 06:18.423
I don't know
anything.

06:18.425 --> 06:21.810
Oh, you witches are
all so monstrously secretive.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.928
Lucky for me,
I'm quite gifted

06:23.930 --> 06:25.930
at unraveling the truth.

06:35.575 --> 06:37.492
OK. There's a coven
in Oregon,

06:37.494 --> 06:38.943
they found away
to communicate

06:38.945 --> 06:41.279
with their ancestors
on the other side

06:41.281 --> 06:42.781
before it went away.

06:42.783 --> 06:45.250
Maybe they know
what happened to your friends.

06:45.252 --> 06:48.002
They call themselves
the Gemini coven.

06:48.004 --> 06:50.121
They're small
and weird,

06:50.123 --> 06:52.257
and they don't
like outsiders.

06:52.259 --> 06:54.292
See? You did
know something.

06:54.294 --> 06:56.594
I just wanted you
to work for it.

07:03.136 --> 07:05.136
Caroline: Ahem.

07:05.138 --> 07:08.857
Heh heh.
Well, well, well.

07:08.859 --> 07:12.477
Now there's a blast
from the past.

07:12.479 --> 07:14.312
Hello, gorgeous.

07:16.950 --> 07:19.200
Talk me
through it again.

07:19.202 --> 07:20.902
I raided the psychology
department's

07:20.904 --> 07:22.787
research library.

07:22.789 --> 07:25.323
In a nutshell, we'll be
using a combination

07:25.325 --> 07:29.210
of hypnotherapy and memory
reprocessing techniques.

07:30.914 --> 07:32.330
The more we talk,

07:32.332 --> 07:33.498
the more you'll relax

07:33.500 --> 07:37.335
and open your mind to me.

07:37.337 --> 07:38.887
We're gonna be searching
through memories

07:38.889 --> 07:40.238
that are deeply embedded,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.390
and each significant memory
that we hit

07:42.392 --> 07:45.009
which is connected to Damon
I will help you modify,

07:45.011 --> 07:46.678
and this should
eventually lead us

07:46.680 --> 07:49.314
to the signature memory,
which once erased

07:49.316 --> 07:51.316
will create a positive
domino effect

07:51.318 --> 07:53.101
through all your
other memories.

07:53.103 --> 07:55.904
Can't you just compel me to forget
everything at once,

07:55.906 --> 07:58.606
and we can go
get a beer?

07:58.608 --> 08:02.410
I'm supernaturally rewiring 3 years
of your memories.

08:02.412 --> 08:05.413
If it were that easy,
I wouldn't be so terrified.

08:08.585 --> 08:10.118
I have some questions.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.037
Answer them honestly.

08:13.039 --> 08:15.540
I will answer
everything honestly.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.542
Do you have doubts
about this?

08:17.544 --> 08:21.930
Yes, but I know
I have to do this.

08:21.932 --> 08:23.381
Are you afraid?

08:23.383 --> 08:25.383
More sad than afraid.

08:25.385 --> 08:26.768
Why sad?

08:26.770 --> 08:28.353
Because I don't want to
stop loving him.

08:28.355 --> 08:31.306
Do you trust me
to be digging around

08:31.308 --> 08:33.140
in your mind?

08:33.143 --> 08:36.394
I trust you completely.

08:36.395 --> 08:41.732
OK. Well, then let's...

08:41.735 --> 08:43.701
Let's get started.

08:45.238 --> 08:47.989
Who was Damon Salvatore?

08:47.991 --> 08:50.742
He was my boyfriend.

08:50.744 --> 08:53.912
I loved him,
and he died.

08:53.914 --> 08:57.832
And when did you
first meet him?

08:57.834 --> 08:59.751
I was in high school.

08:59.753 --> 09:00.802
Damon: Katherine.

09:00.804 --> 09:02.587
No. I'm Elena.

09:02.589 --> 09:04.589
I'm Damon.

09:04.591 --> 09:05.807
Alaric: And what
was he like?

09:05.809 --> 09:08.593
There was something
different about him,

09:08.595 --> 09:12.814
dangerous but not
in a way that scared me.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.232
He was exciting.

09:14.234 --> 09:15.433
I don't know
what I want.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.652
That's not true.

09:17.654 --> 09:20.772
You want what
everybody wants.

09:20.774 --> 09:22.440
What?

09:22.442 --> 09:24.492
And how did he
make you feel?

09:27.614 --> 09:29.831
Like anything
was possible.

09:34.504 --> 09:37.288
You had a nice moment
on the road with a stranger,

09:37.290 --> 09:42.210
but that's all he was,
a stranger.

09:42.212 --> 09:44.762
A stranger.

09:44.764 --> 09:46.814
Two people passing
in the night.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.469
Are you OK?

09:51.471 --> 09:53.488
[Inhales]

09:53.490 --> 09:54.973
Mm-hmm.

09:54.975 --> 09:57.809
Yeah. Let's just--
let's just keep going.

09:57.811 --> 09:59.310
Damon: Ugh.

09:59.312 --> 10:01.312
How many more streets
are we gonna wander?

10:01.314 --> 10:02.981
How many times are
you gonna ask me questions

10:02.983 --> 10:06.317
I don't have
the answers to? Hmm?

10:09.556 --> 10:12.040
There's something weird
about these cars.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.208
Yeah, they're almost
all 20 years old or more,

10:14.210 --> 10:16.894
and yet they look
brand-new.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.329
Hmm.

10:22.886 --> 10:26.888
And that is Elena's
not-so-burnt-to-a-crisp house.

10:39.903 --> 10:42.687
Look.

10:42.689 --> 10:45.106
"Rare solar eclipse
expected to be seen

10:45.108 --> 10:47.108
across 12 states."

10:47.110 --> 10:50.445
The date.

10:50.447 --> 10:54.866
May 10...1994.

10:54.868 --> 10:58.703
Is that--are we--
that's impossible.

11:07.547 --> 11:11.549
I don't think we should be
asking where we are.

11:11.551 --> 11:14.218
I think we should
be asking when we are.

11:21.076 --> 11:24.027
Tell me
about this moment.

11:24.029 --> 11:25.362
No. You know what?

11:25.364 --> 11:26.697
If I'm gonna feel
guilty about something,

11:26.699 --> 11:29.533
I'm gonna feel guilty
about this.

11:29.535 --> 11:30.901
Elena, voice-over:
He kissed me.

11:30.903 --> 11:32.252
I mean, I shouldn't
have let him.

11:32.254 --> 11:33.870
I knew that he was
in love with me,

11:33.872 --> 11:36.339
and even thought
Stefan and I were on the outs,

11:36.341 --> 11:38.408
I shouldn't have
let him.

11:38.410 --> 11:41.928
He kissed you. You thought
it was inappropriate.

11:41.930 --> 11:44.214
You told him so.

11:44.216 --> 11:46.633
I told him
it was wrong.

11:46.635 --> 11:48.385
Who's Damon Salvatore?

11:48.387 --> 11:49.720
He was my boyfriend.

11:49.722 --> 11:52.973
I loved him, and...

11:52.975 --> 11:55.726
He...

11:55.728 --> 11:59.362
He died.

11:59.364 --> 12:01.732
Why don't we, uh--
why don't we take

12:01.734 --> 12:04.067
a little break, OK?

12:04.069 --> 12:06.570
To be honest,
I could use a drink.

12:06.572 --> 12:07.738
Wonder if there's
any booze

12:07.740 --> 12:10.707
in this
empty retroville.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.076
Feels so weird
to be back here.

12:13.078 --> 12:15.312
Practically grew up
on this porch.

12:15.314 --> 12:18.415
All right.
Talk me through it.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.133
Before the other side
collapsed,

12:20.135 --> 12:21.635
my grams said that she
made a sacrifice

12:21.637 --> 12:23.086
so I could find peace.

12:23.088 --> 12:25.555
The part where you
actually have a theory.

12:25.557 --> 12:27.924
Well, this clearly
isn't peace.

12:27.926 --> 12:29.843
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be stuck here with you.

12:29.845 --> 12:31.762
Rude.

12:31.764 --> 12:34.147
She must have--
I don't know--

12:34.149 --> 12:37.200

and when I held your hand,

12:37.202 --> 12:38.902
took you with me.

12:38.904 --> 12:40.771
Well, did she happen
to whisper a safe word

12:40.773 --> 12:43.106
in her last breaths,
a clue maybe,

12:43.108 --> 12:44.157
witchy path out of here?

12:44.159 --> 12:46.076
No, but if we got here
by magic,

12:46.078 --> 12:49.996
magic should be able
to get us out.

12:49.998 --> 12:52.499
And that frown that's
not upside down

12:52.501 --> 12:54.167
is telling me what?

12:58.474 --> 13:01.541
Phesmatos, incendia.

13:14.173 --> 13:15.705

I think would object

13:19.978 --> 13:21.645

positive memories

13:21.647 --> 13:22.979
of Damon from my head.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.815
Yeah, but we we are
literally chasing a lead.

13:24.817 --> 13:27.818
What if we find
something out?

13:27.820 --> 13:30.153
What if Damon returns home

13:30.155 --> 13:31.655
and everything returns
back to normal

13:31.657 --> 13:32.823
and then you're just
sitting there

Then Alaric will bring
back my memories.

13:37.212 --> 13:38.662

13:38.664 --> 13:40.630
Go ahead, Caroline.

I don't want to pressure
you into agreeing.

13:44.219 --> 13:48.221
I don't know
what to say.

13:48.223 --> 13:49.723
I was actually just
trying to think

13:49.725 --> 13:51.758
of what Bonnie would say.

do what's best for you.

it's great

14:06.074 --> 14:07.991

14:14.867 --> 14:16.867

out of school.

you were a lurker

on my life.

used his tongue

up the Gemini coven lead, too?

heard of them.

my best friend.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.973
those feelings going on
forever.

23:30.975 --> 23:32.642
Trust me. You never
forget it.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.277
Maybe we should just
forget about this entire thing.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.145
It was a stupid
idea, OK?

23:36.147 --> 23:37.814
I can't do this anymore,
all right?

23:37.816 --> 23:41.818
I'm done. I'm sorry.

23:48.653 --> 23:50.736
[Music playing]

23:53.432 --> 23:55.265
What's a 7-letter word
for "Kill me now"?

23:55.867 --> 23:58.084
That joke got old
6 weeks ago.

23:58.086 --> 23:59.302
So did this
crossword puzzle.

23:59.304 --> 24:00.786
Every day
for two months,

24:00.788 --> 24:02.221
I've done
this stupid thing,

24:02.223 --> 24:05.207
and I still can't
figure out 27 across.

24:05.209 --> 24:10.796
"An old tongue twister
Eddie turned top 40"?

24:10.798 --> 24:12.965
And I hate pancakes!

24:12.967 --> 24:15.601
Whoa. Don't take it
out on the pancakes.

24:15.603 --> 24:18.137
Those pancakes,
like myself,

24:18.139 --> 24:19.972
are waiting for you
to be witchy

24:19.974 --> 24:21.007
to get us the hell
out of here.

24:21.009 --> 24:22.308
You know I've
been trying.

24:22.310 --> 24:24.310
And failing.

24:24.312 --> 24:25.978
Further evidence
we're in hell.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.446
Not only am I stuck
with you,

24:27.448 --> 24:30.232
I'm stuck with
the useless version of you.

24:34.989 --> 24:36.322
Did you hear that?

24:36.324 --> 24:37.790
What would I
have heard, Bonnie?

24:37.792 --> 24:39.325
We're the only
two people here.

24:39.327 --> 24:41.494
We were the only two
people here two months ago,

24:41.496 --> 24:42.828
and we're the only
two people here now!

24:42.830 --> 24:44.463
Well, I swear
I heard something.

24:44.465 --> 24:46.582
Maybe it's the sound
of existential despair.

24:46.584 --> 24:48.217
I hear that's what hell
sounds like.

24:48.219 --> 24:50.169

You think we're trapped in your hell?

in mine.

So, Stefan, tell us.

very charming.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.667
When'd you get it?

25:04.669 --> 25:05.952
About a month or so ago.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.453
No. More than
that, remember?

25:07.455 --> 25:09.789
We met two months ago,
and you already had it.

25:09.791 --> 25:13.126
You've lived here for
more than two months?

25:13.128 --> 25:17.263
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess I have.

25:17.265 --> 25:20.183
Well, I guess
that's just weird

25:20.185 --> 25:23.603
because everyone thought you
were living somewhere else,

25:23.605 --> 25:26.306
and your job was supposed
to be investigative work,

25:26.308 --> 25:28.641
not auto repair.

25:28.643 --> 25:30.276
Right. Well, I've
moved on from that job.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.944
Well, you can't move on
from investigative work

25:31.946 --> 25:33.313
until you've solved the
investigation, Stefan.

25:33.315 --> 25:35.081
How about we
just drop it?

25:35.083 --> 25:36.649
I'm happy doing
what I'm doing now,

25:36.651 --> 25:38.785
and that's all that
should really matter, right?

25:38.787 --> 25:42.822
There, darling, no need
to make a scene.

25:42.824 --> 25:44.657
Really it's all
probably just some

25:44.659 --> 25:46.159
big misunderstanding.

25:46.161 --> 25:48.127
Perhaps this
will clear it all up.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.495
Aah! Oh, my god!

25:49.497 --> 25:50.630

wrong with you?

Calm down, come with me.
Let's go upstairs.

a scene?

What kind of coward
gives up

You don't know
what you're talking about.

26:15.857 --> 26:18.024
Why don't you
enlighten me?

26:32.123 --> 26:34.540
Hey. This is really
not a good time.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.876
I'm sorry. I've just
hit a wall with Elena.

26:36.878 --> 26:38.277
I just need
some insight.

26:38.279 --> 26:39.712
OK. What's the wall?

26:39.714 --> 26:40.963
I'm trying to get her
to figure out when she

26:40.965 --> 26:42.548
first fell in love
with Damon,

26:42.550 --> 26:44.050
but she can't seem
to get there.

26:44.052 --> 26:45.385
Well, yeah, because
she doesn't want to admit

26:45.387 --> 26:46.719
what everyone else
already knows.

get him out of here.

and I really don't feel like

27:09.067 --> 27:10.433
another go-around.

27:10.435 --> 27:12.902
I'm sorry that you heard
what I said.

27:15.106 --> 27:17.323
It's fine, Caroline.

27:17.325 --> 27:20.576
I really don't care.

27:20.578 --> 27:23.279
Why?

27:23.281 --> 27:25.615
Why don't you care?

27:25.617 --> 27:28.084
You were the one
who always cared.

27:28.086 --> 27:30.586
It's what I liked
about you.

27:30.588 --> 27:32.422
You know, amidst
all the crazy

27:32.424 --> 27:34.957
in our perfectly
messed up lives,

27:34.959 --> 27:36.542
you cared more
than anyone,

27:36.544 --> 27:38.344
so how could you
just stop?

27:38.346 --> 27:40.179
Because I had to.

27:40.181 --> 27:42.298
I had to move on.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.883
You know, the months
before I moved here,

27:43.885 --> 27:46.552
I was following every lead that
Alaric sent my way.

27:46.554 --> 27:49.055
I spoke to every witch,
every shaman,

27:49.057 --> 27:51.724
every psychic in 20 countries
around the globe,

27:51.726 --> 27:53.726
and every lead was
a dead end.

27:53.728 --> 27:55.311
But Enzo has
another lead.

27:55.313 --> 27:56.646
There's this coven
in Oregon--

27:56.647 --> 27:58.280
the Gemini coven. Yeah.

27:58.283 --> 27:59.732
I looked into them,
too, Caroline.

27:59.734 --> 28:01.651
There was nothing there
because there's

28:01.653 --> 28:03.486
nothing we can do.

28:03.488 --> 28:06.122
Damon and Bonnie
are dead.

28:06.124 --> 28:07.740
I had to come to terms
with that,

28:07.742 --> 28:10.126
and once I did,
I had to start over.

28:10.128 --> 28:11.994
I couldn't just live
my old life

28:11.996 --> 28:13.329
with my old friends.

28:13.331 --> 28:15.164
I couldn't go near
Mystic Falls or Elena--

28:15.166 --> 28:16.666
or me?

28:19.971 --> 28:23.089
Because I thought we
were closer than that.

28:23.091 --> 28:26.509
I mean, you couldn't hear
in all those messages that I left you,

28:26.511 --> 28:30.680
you couldn't hear that I was
completely falling apart without you?

28:39.657 --> 28:43.025

listened to them.

honest with yourself.

still with Stefan.

faithful to Stefan.

-I did everything.

30:04.609 --> 30:06.275
I know you did, Elena.

30:06.277 --> 30:07.910
You don't want to admit it
because you feel like

30:07.912 --> 30:09.111
you're betraying Stefan,
but this won't work

30:09.113 --> 30:10.279
until you do.

in your young life.

wrong with that.

used to say.

my own evil doppelganger

30:47.986 --> 30:49.952
was smarter than me?

You can tell me.

summer looking for Stefan,

that I wasn't gonna go.

leave the room

my birthday gift.

It was a necklace that
Stefan had given me.

it hurt him,

35:46.555 --> 35:47.854
Oh, you know,
my friend, he's,

35:47.856 --> 35:50.223
uh, a bad drunk.

35:50.225 --> 35:55.395
Yipes. Well, at least
your friend Caroline seemed nice.

35:55.397 --> 35:57.030
Yeah.

35:57.032 --> 35:58.949
I'm gonna
throw this out.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.576
Let her go.

36:11.079 --> 36:12.379
OK.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.920
I've got a girl out
there crying over you

36:19.922 --> 36:22.055
because she cares
so much,

36:22.057 --> 36:23.590
and I'm here trying
to figure out why

36:23.592 --> 36:27.060
but I can't see what's
worth caring about.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.728
You know, Damon once
told me that he promised you

36:28.730 --> 36:30.764
an eternity of misery,
and I remember thinking,

36:30.766 --> 36:32.516
"well, what could his
brother have ever done

36:32.518 --> 36:35.068
to inspire
so much hatred?"

36:35.070 --> 36:38.104
But now I get it.

36:38.106 --> 36:41.658
You're not
a brother to him.

36:41.660 --> 36:45.028
Brothers don't give up.

36:45.030 --> 36:46.746
So every time I see
you doing anything

36:46.748 --> 36:48.415
that looks like
you've done so,

36:48.417 --> 36:50.417
every time you try
to start over in a life

36:50.419 --> 36:52.619
that's nothing
but a lie,

36:52.621 --> 36:55.455
I will make you pay.

36:55.457 --> 36:58.959
I will be the one to
bring you the misery you deserve.

36:58.961 --> 37:00.293
Err!

37:02.464 --> 37:08.068
See? We're still
neck people.

37:08.070 --> 37:09.102
Bonnie on phone:
It's Bonnie.

37:09.104 --> 37:10.637
Leave me a message.

37:10.639 --> 37:13.106
Jeremy: Hey. It's me.
I paid your cell bill again.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.975
Your mom said I could.
I think she felt

37:14.977 --> 37:16.977
sorry for me or something.

37:16.979 --> 37:19.145
Maybe she just wants to hear
the sound of your voice, too.

37:19.147 --> 37:20.313
What do I know?

37:20.315 --> 37:22.649
[Music playing]

37:22.651 --> 37:24.568
I am so pissed at you, Bonnie.

37:24.570 --> 37:28.955
Yeah. Still. You told me you
were gonna die over the phone,

37:28.957 --> 37:31.374
so you kind of deserve me
railing at you on voicemails

37:31.376 --> 37:33.460
that you're never gonna get.

37:38.083 --> 37:41.501
I guess I'll call
and yell at you again tomorrow.

37:49.978 --> 37:51.478
Gah! You scared
the hell out of me.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.480
Shh. We got
a little problem.

37:53.482 --> 37:56.182
Sarah's shady. The plates
on her car are stolen.

37:56.184 --> 37:57.317
She's got to go.

37:57.319 --> 37:58.351
What are you--
deputy Dewey?

37:58.353 --> 37:59.686
How do you know that?

37:59.688 --> 38:01.187
Sarah: It doesn't matter
how he knows it.

38:01.189 --> 38:03.940
He's right. I stole it
from my old boss.

38:03.942 --> 38:05.859
He had wandering hands,
so I wandered my hands

38:05.861 --> 38:07.193
to his car keys.

38:07.195 --> 38:08.528
Look, no offense,
but you got to find

38:08.530 --> 38:09.696
someplace else to say.

38:09.698 --> 38:11.164
I totally get it.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.532
I appreciate you guys
helping me.

38:12.534 --> 38:13.833
Really, I do.

38:13.835 --> 38:17.087
It's OK. I have
family here sort of.

38:17.089 --> 38:19.706
I mean, I haven't met him,

38:19.708 --> 38:22.509
but my dad,
he supposedly lives here.

38:22.511 --> 38:24.461
It's not like he's gonna let
me sleep on the street, right?

38:24.463 --> 38:26.579
Matt, at least let
her stay till she finds her dad.

38:26.581 --> 38:27.881
Seriously, Jer?

38:27.883 --> 38:29.182
I'm on the community
protection committee,

38:29.184 --> 38:30.850
and she's a car thief.

38:30.852 --> 38:32.302
All right. Fine.
We can go stay

38:32.304 --> 38:33.720
at Stefan and Damon's.
No one's there.

38:33.722 --> 38:34.938
You can't leave.
I told Elena that

38:34.940 --> 38:36.473
I'd watch out for you.

38:36.475 --> 38:38.155
It's not like she
can do anything about it.

38:46.068 --> 38:48.318
Matt, voice-over: So she
says she has family here.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.736
That's probably
another lie,

38:49.738 --> 38:50.738
but I'll look into it.

38:50.739 --> 38:51.905
Thanks, Matt.

38:51.907 --> 38:53.156
Look. Jeremy's
a good kid.

38:53.158 --> 38:55.041
He's just going
through some stuff.

38:55.043 --> 38:56.159
I know all
about him.

38:56.161 --> 38:58.378
I grew up
with his dad.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.497
Wait. You're
from Mystic Falls?

39:00.499 --> 39:02.332
Born and raised till
my parents split.

39:02.334 --> 39:04.718
I think that's why
I'm such a geek about this town.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.919
My family were such
big supporters,

39:05.921 --> 39:07.587
one of the founding
families actually.

39:07.589 --> 39:08.922
Which family?

39:08.924 --> 39:12.592
The Fells. I'm
Thomas Vincent Fell III,

39:12.594 --> 39:14.227
to be exact.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.679
My dad called me Tripp,

39:15.681 --> 39:17.347
but I was such
a clumsy kid

39:17.349 --> 39:19.599
that I took my mom's maiden name
when he bailed.

39:19.601 --> 39:23.737
Can you imagine--
Tripp fell?

39:23.739 --> 39:26.439
So if you're
from a founding family,

39:26.441 --> 39:29.325
that means you know all the stuff
that goes along with it then, right?

39:29.327 --> 39:32.412
Oh. Is there a secret handshake
I never got taught?

39:32.414 --> 39:34.948
Look. Um, I got to go.
I'll see you later

39:34.950 --> 39:36.282
for training,
though, yeah?

39:36.284 --> 39:37.617
Yeah, sure.

39:37.619 --> 39:39.836
[Music continues]

39:39.838 --> 39:41.287
[Sighs]

39:44.926 --> 39:46.926
Any final words?

39:46.928 --> 39:49.095
[Hissing and screaming]

39:55.971 --> 39:57.303
Aah!

40:20.712 --> 40:23.163
[Screaming continues]

40:23.165 --> 40:25.999
[Music playing]

40:54.996 --> 40:57.030
I miss them, too,
you know?

41:10.378 --> 41:13.346
Look who got 27 across.

41:13.348 --> 41:16.216
I wish. 27 across
is a rock

41:16.218 --> 41:18.685
I am pushing up
an endless mountain.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.720
"An old tongue twister
Eddie turned top 40."

41:20.722 --> 41:23.556
Eddie Vedder,
Pearl Jam.

41:23.558 --> 41:25.024
"Yellow Ledbetter."

41:25.026 --> 41:26.526
Good work.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.983
Are you messing
with me?

41:33.985 --> 41:36.202
No. Are you
messing with me?

41:37.789 --> 41:40.707
I didn't finish this.

41:40.709 --> 41:42.192
Well, neither did I.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.081
There's someone
else here.
