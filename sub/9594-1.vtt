00:21.155 --> 00:23.557
* The flowers, the flowers

00:23.657 --> 00:25.626
* Grow in the ground

00:25.726 --> 00:27.261
* Give them water

00:27.361 --> 00:28.796
* Or they will die

00:33.634 --> 00:34.735
Blackfire?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.036
Hey, little sister.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.573
Cover my flank.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.441
Of course!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.179
What are you doing here?

00:45.279 --> 00:46.414
I came to see you, sweetie.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.151
But you never visit.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.085
I thought
you did not like me.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.223
Oh, honey!
Where did you get that idea?

00:55.323 --> 00:56.524
You never answer my calls.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.559
Got a new number.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.563
When I was five
you stole my favorite dolly.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.432
Just so I could
have something that
reminded me of you.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.105
So you really came
back here just for me?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.806
There is no other reason?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.742
I just had to see
my baby sister.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.346
Ooh! Then we can
begin the closeness.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.317
Okay, enough hugging.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.325
Wonderful friends,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.227
look who has paid us
a surprise visit!

01:33.727 --> 01:35.163
I love surprise visits!

01:36.897 --> 01:38.299
Hey, everybody.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.100
Except for that one.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.170
-Her.
-Ugh. Bah!

01:42.270 --> 01:44.372
Yes, the Her herself.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.107
Hi Robin, you miss me?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.510
Uh, no.
Because you are evil.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.714
And I'm only attracted
to niceness and sweetness,

01:53.814 --> 01:56.284
and innocent things,
like a puppy with ears
too big for his head.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.287
Star, can I talk
to you a minute?

01:59.387 --> 02:00.388
STAR: Oh!

02:01.789 --> 02:04.792
Can you believe Blackfire
has come to see me?

02:04.892 --> 02:06.527
Is that not wonderful?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.363
Every time you
let her into your life
she crushes you.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.698
But I do not
think this time...

02:10.798 --> 02:12.366
No!

02:13.701 --> 02:15.269
She is one of the
most wanted criminals
in the galaxy, Star.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.239
Mmm-hmm.
Girl, that girl is
bad girl news, girl.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.640
She's up to something.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.675
And ugh... Blah!

02:21.775 --> 02:24.278
Stop it!

02:24.378 --> 02:27.681
All I have ever wished
for is to have this
sister relationship.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.651
And Blackfire knows

02:30.751 --> 02:34.255
if she lets me down again
it will break my heart.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.924
And darkness
will ooze from it,

02:37.024 --> 02:39.293
contaminating the
river of my soul.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.195
Then filled with the poison

02:41.295 --> 02:43.231
I will rain death
and destruction

02:43.331 --> 02:45.666
upon all the creatures
of the universe!

02:45.766 --> 02:47.201
Starting with...

02:48.336 --> 02:50.271
Hey, Sis.
Let's dye your hair
so we can be twinsies.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.540
Ooh, I always wanted
to be the twinsies.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.176
Sister fun time!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.330
You look great, sweetie.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.565
But it's really
missing something.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.199
What is it that is missing?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.334
I know.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.338
Oh, that's such
a great color for you.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.342
There is something of meaning
I wish to relate to you.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.943
I have dreamed of us...

03:30.043 --> 03:30.778
Shh. Can it wait?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.781
WOMAN: That's Blackfire,
the one you're looking for.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.787
Bye-bye, sweetie.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.255
Blackfire!

04:08.716 --> 04:09.817
Hey, Robin.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.453
Anyone ever tell you
you have a nice butt?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.021
Save it,
you shameless harpy.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.690
I don't know why
Star puts up with you.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.259
Wait, where is she?
What did you do to her?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.728
Titans, dig up the yard!

04:23.931 --> 04:25.466
Argh!

04:25.566 --> 04:27.568
Oh, calm down, Mr. Butt.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.771
She's fine.
She's just in jail
serving out my sentence.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.840
This is why you showed
up in the first place.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.642
-Unbelievable!
-She trusted you.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.744
Dibs on Star's room!

04:38.679 --> 04:40.581
She's got the best room,
end of the day.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.417
How could you do this to her?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.686
Oh, cut me some
slack, Mr. Butt.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.322
No one ever taught me
how to be a good sister.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.491
Then get yourself a backpack
and a spiral notebook.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.059
And a number two
pencil and a pen
and a math book

04:52.159 --> 04:53.761
and a protractor
and a scientific calculator,

04:53.861 --> 04:55.663
with a juice box
and some healthy snacks,

04:55.763 --> 04:57.565
and an apple
for your teacher.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.733
-'Cause we're gonna
take you to school.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.801
Sister school yo.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.440
Now listen
so I can teach you
how to listen.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.442
Huh, whatever.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.843
The keys to active listening

05:09.943 --> 05:12.446
are eye-contact,
and hand-holding.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.981
Allow me to demonstrate.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.084
Go on, Beast Boy.
I'm listening.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.753
My problem is
I'm just too sweet
and funny.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.822
And girls
just take advantage.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.591
I hear your pain.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.760
You have to talk it out
before you can walk it out.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.861
Now you try.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.831
Go on, Beast Boy.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.333
I'm listening.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.703
Sometimes I think
I'll never find love.

05:37.004 --> 05:37.905
Shut up and be a man!

05:39.072 --> 05:41.809
My...

05:47.881 --> 05:50.584
You have broken
my heart, Sister.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.421
And now I will break you.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.503
Okay, lesson two.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.540
Hugging.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.911
-Oh.
-ROBIN: Terrible effort.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.379
-Ahhh!
-Again!

06:20.514 --> 06:22.516
No, no, no.
I'll show you myself.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.884
Arms out wide,

06:25.619 --> 06:26.987
come in tight
but not too tight.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.456
Pats on the back, optional.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.391
Yes, that's much,
much better.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.494
Oh, this feels good.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.895
No, no, no.
Wrong kind of hug.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.530
-Get away.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.887
Oh! Greetings friend.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.889
What are you doing?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.791
"Oh, sister,
I'm here to tell you

07:03.891 --> 07:06.560
"how you have made me feel
all these gamma years."

07:06.660 --> 07:08.195
You look ridiculous.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.497
You look ridiculous!

07:09.597 --> 07:11.064
Stick to the script.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.000
What Starfire meant to say

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
is do not be the
glorpner, friend.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.839
Glorpner? That's not
even a word, genius.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.774
Don't you make
me come over there!

07:20.874 --> 07:22.510
I told you
this wouldn't work.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.478
Stay in character.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.814
What the Starfires
are trying to say is...

07:29.182 --> 07:31.852
"When you were in the trouble
who did you turn to?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.587
"Oh, sister,
when you were..."

07:33.687 --> 07:35.022
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.925
Your butt looks
fantastic in that skirt.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.793
Argh!

07:39.893 --> 07:42.162
I have no idea
how Starfire could
still love you

07:42.262 --> 07:43.697
after all you
put her through.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.535
She loves me?

07:47.635 --> 07:49.837
Probably the only person
in the universe who does.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.085
Wait.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.654
I wanna be
a better sister.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.069
Sister fun time.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.714
Looks good.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.283
I'm so glad you like it.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.219
Uh, you think you could
give me a make

08:39.319 --> 08:40.988
I hate my look.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.924
I hear somebody who's
not happy with himself.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.927
But who should be,
because he is great.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.929
Aww. Thanks!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.297
So Robin...

08:50.397 --> 08:52.800
Please, call me Mr. Butt,
you've earned it.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.168
I wish you were
my sister, sister.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.970
Starfire's gonna be
so proud of you.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.575
Hey, she's back.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.076
Star?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.111
Mr. Butt, are you okay?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.647
I'm here

09:06.747 --> 09:07.981
for the Her!

09:09.216 --> 09:11.184
Blackfire, remember
the lessons!

09:11.284 --> 09:13.286
Starfire, sweetie...

09:13.386 --> 09:15.789
You have never
done anything for me,

09:15.889 --> 09:18.025
except use me
and trick me

09:18.125 --> 09:19.627
and get me into trouble!

09:19.727 --> 09:21.929
I hear you and I'm sorry!

09:22.029 --> 09:24.564
It's too late for the sorry!

09:27.200 --> 09:28.168
Ahhh!

09:55.796 --> 09:56.997
You look like
you could use a hug.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.732
Ahhh!

09:58.832 --> 09:59.967
This would look great on you.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.705
I am not falling
for the act again!

10:04.805 --> 10:06.874
Wait, I've got
something to show you.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.279
The dolly you stole
from me as a child?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.281
Blackfire,
where did you get it?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.249
I've had it the whole time.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.751
I shouldn't have taken it.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.619
And I shouldn't have kept it.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.855
Starfire, I'm sorry.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.757
You really have changed.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.759
Yes. I have.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.628
Well,

10:28.729 --> 10:29.830
so have I.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.306
So what happened?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.043
We worked things out.
