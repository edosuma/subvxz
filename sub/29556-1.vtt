-Sure.

your phone I can show you
how to use the app.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.920

Hey, I got this clock, watch
and a pretty good knife.

15:13.647 --> 15:14.579
The watch runs?

15:14.581 --> 15:17.415
Uhm, I was hoping maybe
you'd fix it.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.385
Buy, sell, pawn, no repairs.

15:22.489 --> 15:26.024
Any way I can get cash
today, up front?

15:26.026 --> 15:26.958
No.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.163
Is that real?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.364

-Did you get the job?
-No, 'cause your

17:16.569 --> 17:17.769
car's a piece of shit.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.771
Mouth, no obscenities
in my house!

17:19.772 --> 17:21.571
I couldn't get the job!

17:21.574 --> 17:23.508
'Cause your car!

17:23.510 --> 17:26.577
The engine, it blew up
and now it's going to

17:26.579 --> 17:28.613
they're going to take it away
and it's going to

17:53.106 --> 17:53.838
What?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.208
You know that you've
always been immature.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.778
You probably got mad
and wore the car down.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.748
It was a good car.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.383
You think that this is my fault?

No, no he's just angry.

Okay, same as last time.
Alright.

-[officer Dixon] Hello, Ronnie.
-Sir.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.167
You know why your mother
called me here tonight?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.402
Yes, sir.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.505
Y'know, frankly I'm...

19:36.442 --> 19:37.675
I'm tired of getting
these calls.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.778
You've been off probation
long enough,

19:40.780 --> 19:41.879
what's the problem?

19:43.850 --> 19:44.916
I'm just frustrated.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.518
No one listens to me.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.687
I feel like shit.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.724
I'm listening to you
Ronnie, loud and clear.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.696
Now, I could cite you for
a domestic, but I won't.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.402
If you touch your mother,
that's a whole other story.

20:06.239 --> 20:06.971

-Yeah.
-Alright.

We haven't had a real man
in this house

20:47.413 --> 20:49.614
in so long, thank you Officer.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.017
Okay, if he has any
more outbursts

20:53.019 --> 20:56.420
we can refer him to
county for a psych eval.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.856
Having a job would help
him out a great deal.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.959
He'll have one this week,
or you can take him in.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.429

wrong in this world.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.010
Right now, right?

23:01.414 --> 23:02.780
Lot of bad shit, huh?

23:06.786 --> 23:08.753
[sniffs]

23:08.755 --> 23:09.987
In our country...

23:21.467 --> 23:24.735
Today was a pretty
rough day for me.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.172
I lost a lot of money
and I lost a car

23:28.174 --> 23:29.607
and I lost a job.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.644
But everywhere I go
there's illegals

23:34.647 --> 23:35.746
and they're running the show.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.150
They own everything.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.653
And they look down on you.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.661
My father was a real man.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.697
He died.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.436
In the Gulf War.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.939
Back when America cared
about its heroes.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.813
But now we got these
libtards running the show.

24:10.149 --> 24:13.484
You can't be proud to be
white and male anymore.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.454
It's not politically correct.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.156

try and tell you

24:19.158 --> 24:21.058
what to be, what to think.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.194
Well, you know what?

24:23.196 --> 24:25.696
White men created this country.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.565
We created this country.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.034
But we're losing it, folks.

24:30.937 --> 24:34.004
But as real patriots, we got
to have each other's backs.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.174
Because I don't want to
lose this fucking country

24:37.176 --> 24:41.812

[Ronnie voiceover] <i> Look at her,</i>
<i> the old bitch.</i>

33:51.797 --> 33:54.364
<i> She won't ever let me alone.</i>

33:54.366 --> 33:56.733
<i> She gets something out</i>

33:57.703 --> 34:00.303

34:00.305 --> 34:02.439
<i> to get more comfortable</i>

34:03.208 --> 34:05.142
<i>While a man has to get out there</i>

34:05.144 --> 34:08.411

34:08.414 --> 34:11.047

34:17.755 --> 34:20.290

34:20.292 --> 34:23.293

34:23.295 --> 34:25.629

<i> 'em and they act all innocent,</i>

34:26.465 --> 34:28.732

<i> got to be an alpha male,</i>

34:28.734 --> 34:31.467

34:31.703 --> 34:34.771
man, stronger than woman.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.277
Women are weaker, women
are weaker so they need

34:40.279 --> 34:41.578
a man to get them stuff.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.614
Got to know what you're
dealing with.

34:48.219 --> 34:51.487
Yeah, that's it, stay strong.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.558
Patriots, stay strong.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.796
Fuck yeah.

35:36.502 --> 35:37.434
Hey.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.203
Yo, Reza!

35:43.542 --> 35:44.525
What're you doing
in those books?

35:44.526 --> 35:45.509
What if somebody wants to
come in and buy something?

35:46.445 --> 35:48.411
I'm studying, but I think my dad

35:48.413 --> 35:50.514
wanted you to change the heads
before you started mopping.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.482
No, he didn't say shit to me.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.686
I think you just fucking study
so you don't have to work.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.823
It's the SAT I'm trying
to get into Stanford.

36:00.225 --> 36:05.262
Oh, okay, you're going to
be Mr. Fancy Pants, huh?

36:05.397 --> 36:08.598
-Yeah.
-Mr. fucking scholar, okay.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.200
Well, you know what?

[loud knocking]

36:18.644 --> 36:22.445
Condoms, I want some rubbers,
I have a hot date tonight.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.515
I'm serious.

36:27.953 --> 36:28.885
Okay.

-[cash register beeping]
-[Reza] $3.85

36:34.393 --> 36:35.525
Do we get an employee discount?

36:35.527 --> 36:36.459
No.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
Keep the change.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.301
'Cause come tomorrow, you're
going to hear all the stories.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.336
Sure.

36:51.944 --> 36:55.679
Hey! [giggles]

36:56.848 --> 36:58.682
I'm going to get some
big news. [laughs]

37:03.922 --> 37:07.290
Hey, Melanie....Hi Melanie

37:07.559 --> 37:10.293
Hi, Ronnie.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.868
[water running]

37:18.870 --> 37:21.905
Hi, how are you, Melanie?
I'm Ronnie.

37:23.242 --> 37:27.477
Well, it's Ronald but everyone's
always called me Ronnie.

37:31.783 --> 37:35.352
[soft jazz music]

37:38.423 --> 37:39.456
[Melanie] Ooh, I'll have that

37:39.458 --> 37:41.658
Madame Butterfly tea, please.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.859
[server] Sure.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.296
[soft jazz music]

37:50.636 --> 37:53.770
So, I figure I just need
one more semester at Season.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.039
I mean I could do another
semester but I really

37:56.041 --> 37:58.575
want to push for UCLA,
they have a much better

37:58.577 --> 38:00.277
program there and I dunno,

38:00.279 --> 38:01.945
I just kind of want to
explore someplace new.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.648
Right now I'm just happy
that I can pay my bills

38:04.650 --> 38:06.916
and I'm finally getting
to study what I love.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.320
So what about you,
you seem kind of quiet.

38:10.822 --> 38:14.924
I have a job and I'm
just kind of hanging out,

38:14.926 --> 38:17.027
y'know like I can't complain.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.065
Do you enjoy what you do?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.968
Mmm, no, but I mean
who does, right?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.837
Maybe you could find something
that you enjoy better.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.907
I'd really like it if
I was in the military.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.909
Special Ops.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.444
I don't really know
much about that.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.079
Why the military?

38:36.081 --> 38:37.614
What do you mean why?

38:37.883 --> 38:39.949
I'm just curious. [giggles]

38:40.986 --> 38:44.454
Well, because there's a
shitload of threats right now.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.489
We're getting threatened
all the time

38:46.558 --> 38:49.659
and nobody's doing anything,
so I want to

38:49.661 --> 38:51.828
fight for our country
you know, they need men.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.029
I mean most guys
in college today

38:53.031 --> 38:54.798
are cucks anyway, you know?

38:54.800 --> 38:56.499
-They're what?
-Cuck.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.436
You know cuck, like a pussy.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.779
That's a derogatory use of
that word, I find it offensive.

39:10.982 --> 39:14.017
Pussy? Why?

39:14.019 --> 39:15.552
Because you think
pussy means weak.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.521
Anything a woman has
is less than a man's?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.924
No, I got no problem with pussy.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.827
I just mean that men
should act like men.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.764
You know, I mean you
like real men, right?

39:27.766 --> 39:29.532
Admit it, all chicks do.

39:29.534 --> 39:33.002
-Chicks?
-What? I--

39:33.004 --> 39:35.538
Nothing is untrue, what I said.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.043
You really think that you're
going to support yourself

39:40.045 --> 39:42.112
with this bullshit arts degree?

39:42.114 --> 39:43.546
You know what, I think
you would've been

39:43.548 --> 39:44.731
a lot more successful

39:44.732 --> 39:45.915
if you'd have gone to college.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.617
What is that supposed to mean?

39:47.619 --> 39:50.019
We are not a match,
best of luck.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.488
Wait a minute, you can't
go anywhere yet

39:51.490 --> 39:52.756
I bought you this
fucking coffee.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.023
I bought you this,
here no, look.

39:55.460 --> 39:55.926
Let go of me!

39:55.927 --> 39:56.393
You think
you're better than me--

39:56.395 --> 39:57.727
Let go of me!

39:57.729 --> 39:59.696
-She said, let go!
-[customer] Hey man!

40:01.566 --> 40:04.401
Okay no, no, no,
I'm not a bad guy

40:04.503 --> 40:06.069
I'm just trying to talk to her

40:06.171 --> 40:07.771
but you're being
a fucking bitch!

40:07.773 --> 40:09.539
You're being a fucking bitch!

40:20.419 --> 40:22.185

40:23.455 --> 40:25.522
<i> They're out to brainwash</i>
<i> people, folks</i>

40:25.524 --> 40:26.990
and they're succeeding
by turning

40:26.992 --> 40:29.626
these women into
fucking feminazis.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.829
Meanwhile, while men
are out there trying to

40:32.831 --> 40:37.100
get real jobs that are
useful to society,

40:37.969 --> 40:41.671
these women are tricked into
studying this useless crap.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.742
What're you going to do with
a women's studies diploma?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.645
Let me tell ya you're probably
going to marry a rich guy

40:48.647 --> 40:50.013
like the gold digger
that you are.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.882
You act like you're respectable,

40:52.884 --> 40:55.118
well you don't have any
respect for average guys.

40:55.921 --> 40:57.554
Fucking gold digger.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.791
You work hard and wait
for the vultures.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.527
You better believe it, patriots.

more money, nicer car,

41:11.670 --> 41:13.236
And they get away with it,
they get away with it

41:13.238 --> 41:14.704
'cause they got all
these guys who are

41:14.706 --> 41:16.239
white knighting around them.

41:16.241 --> 41:19.642
All these fucking losers who
are trying to defend them,

41:19.644 --> 41:22.078
they want to fuck them,
but they make me look out

41:22.080 --> 41:24.147
like I'm the bad guy.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.184
Any guy who defends
feminism is a cuck.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.687
He's a cuck or a fag.

41:32.157 --> 41:37.527

signing off, patriots.

you needed any yard work.

yeah I think we

might have some work for you.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.209
The flowerbed in the front, huh?

48:03.615 --> 48:07.483
Yeah, we'll be out in a minute.

48:08.653 --> 48:12.221
Just right, the one on the left?

48:12.223 --> 48:13.923
To the left, the flowerbed.

48:33.111 --> 48:34.410
-Hey.
-Hi.

48:34.612 --> 48:36.379
I thought maybe you
could use some iced tea.

48:36.614 --> 48:37.647
Sure.

48:46.391 --> 48:48.491
It's good, thank you.

48:48.493 --> 48:50.927
[laughs] You don't
plant the planter.

48:52.664 --> 48:54.230
Here, what you do is
you just give it

48:54.232 --> 48:56.299
a little light squeeze...

48:56.935 --> 48:59.302
and slide it
right out like that.

49:00.538 --> 49:03.372
And you sort of loosen up
the roots a little

49:04.309 --> 49:06.042
then slip it right in.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.179
[laughs] Oops.

49:11.182 --> 49:12.415
Yeah, just like that.

-Yeah.

Perfect, oh that's great.

49:35.373 --> 49:37.039
And just like that.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.109
Do you have a girlfriend?

49:42.246 --> 49:43.346
Not right now.

49:44.248 --> 49:47.483
No? Huh, I'm surprised.

-Red one?

-Yep, gentle, gentle.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.711
Now let's do a purple one.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.581
You got it.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.453
Thank you.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.123
Ronnie?

50:30.161 --> 50:31.594
Bill and I think you're
pretty cool.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.463
We're going to party tonight
if you want to join us.

50:36.601 --> 50:37.533
Party?

50:42.540 --> 50:45.775
We sometimes record it.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.217
Just for personal use.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.621
If that's...

51:01.726 --> 51:03.092
cool with you?

51:09.534 --> 51:12.334
[synth music]

51:37.829 --> 51:39.128
That's it.

51:47.238 --> 51:49.805
[loud moaning]

51:49.807 --> 51:54.176
Yeah, go ahead, come
here, darling, it's okay.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.546
You like to watch?

51:58.883 --> 52:02.384
Yeah? Me too.

52:02.386 --> 52:07.123
[gasps] Oh, that's it.
Touch yourself.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.793
[synth music]

52:18.903 --> 52:20.636
Come closer, Ronnie.

52:22.306 --> 52:23.239
That's it.

52:25.343 --> 52:28.611
Go ahead, play with yourself.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.480
[loud moaning]

52:31.482 --> 52:32.681
On your knees.

52:35.720 --> 52:36.886
Yeah, oh yeah.

52:41.459 --> 52:42.758
Oh, let me see.

52:48.499 --> 52:49.632
Oh, that's it.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.669
Take your shirt off.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.573
That's it, that's it, baby.

53:00.244 --> 53:02.778
[gasping]

53:13.858 --> 53:16.592
[loud moaning]

53:54.632 --> 53:56.265
So we really like you, Ronnie.

53:59.470 --> 54:00.970
You like to party with us?

54:02.807 --> 54:03.739
Yes.

54:05.343 --> 54:06.942
We shoot a lot of our parties.

54:08.613 --> 54:10.279
Mainly for my VIP crowd,

54:10.748 --> 54:12.314
you know just stuff like
you did tonight.

54:13.451 --> 54:14.450
You get paid.

54:17.622 --> 54:18.554
Seriously?

54:19.257 --> 54:20.256
Yeah.

54:20.825 --> 54:23.525
Two, three times a week.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.929
All you got to do is
follow the script.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.565
Can you do that, Ronnie?

54:30.801 --> 54:31.967
Can you follow the script?

54:40.444 --> 54:43.545
[upbeat choral music]

54:51.722 --> 54:52.755
[door slamming]

54:52.757 --> 54:54.890
Baby, I've been worried sick.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.859
It's some darn girl, isn't it?

54:57.328 --> 54:58.994
-No.
-[mother] Some little thing

54:58.996 --> 55:00.596
-you've been seeing.
-No.

55:02.066 --> 55:03.565
Did you have a good day at work?

55:06.504 --> 55:09.772
Yeah, yeah, it was good.

55:09.974 --> 55:10.906
Work's good.

55:14.011 --> 55:17.079
[upbeat choral music]

55:27.725 --> 55:29.491
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.460
Please, I need
the money, please.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.329
These are too old, they're crap.

55:33.331 --> 55:36.398
I try them,
they all work, I swear.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.666
I have better ones in my store.

55:39.937 --> 55:41.737
Ten dollars, it's okay.

55:41.739 --> 55:43.005
[pawnbroker] I said no.

55:43.007 --> 55:44.006
Please I need the money.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.108
Excuse me, do you speak English?

55:46.110 --> 55:47.576
Do you speak English?

55:47.578 --> 55:49.978
He said no, he doesn't
want your shit.

55:49.980 --> 55:51.547
That means get the fuck out.

55:54.719 --> 55:56.985
You still got the Deagle?
I brought cash.

55:57.722 --> 55:58.887
Sold it earlier today.

56:00.458 --> 56:04.860
Shit, guess it's not
my lucky day, huh.

56:10.401 --> 56:11.533
Well, what about that?

56:15.740 --> 56:16.672
How much?

56:20.745 --> 56:24.880
So, I've been reading
some of your comments

56:26.417 --> 56:29.118
first of all thank you,
a lot of patriots

56:29.120 --> 56:31.019
enjoyed my last video

56:31.021 --> 56:35.090
and I just want to say
that I did it for you guys.

56:38.996 --> 56:44.066
I'm worried, I'm worried about
the safety of this country

56:44.535 --> 56:46.869
as we get more and more
of these immigrants in.

56:47.438 --> 56:49.171
We're not only seeing
them take over stores

56:49.173 --> 56:52.508
and neighborhoods, but they're
actively threatening us

56:52.510 --> 56:54.643
and trying to make us afraid.

56:55.012 --> 56:57.146
I mean, okay here's
what happens,

56:57.148 --> 56:59.448
see, the liberal presidents

56:59.450 --> 57:03.485
that we've had, they
slowly started giving

57:03.487 --> 57:07.523
more and more and more of
these special snowflake rights

57:07.525 --> 57:09.558
to people who don't belong here.

57:10.795 --> 57:13.095
Everywhere you look
you got liberal cucks

57:13.097 --> 57:16.698
screaming about black
rights, Muslim rights,

57:16.700 --> 57:20.102
they say we're to blame,
that we owe them something.

57:20.104 --> 57:22.638
They stir shit up these days
because they know

57:22.640 --> 57:24.206
that the liberal Jews are
going to print anything

57:24.208 --> 57:26.809
that attacks real white
American men.

57:27.478 --> 57:29.478
So you best believe I'm
going to stand my ground

57:29.480 --> 57:31.780
if I-- if I need to.

57:32.783 --> 57:38.153
Look, I'm not racist I just know

57:38.155 --> 57:41.790
the difference between a
black person and a nigger.

57:43.494 --> 57:47.196
Now the Muslims... don't
even get me started

57:47.198 --> 57:50.065
they come in like rats, you
just blink and they have

57:50.067 --> 57:53.168
taken over everything,
every single store,

57:53.170 --> 57:55.571
they think that they're
better than you.

57:55.573 --> 57:58.140
Makes their day to look down
on a real American.

58:00.744 --> 58:03.579
Just because you got an
upgrade from goat-fucker Syria

58:05.683 --> 58:07.683
that don't mean that
you can come here
and try and take away

58:07.685 --> 58:09.017
the freedom that we made

58:09.019 --> 58:10.619
for ourselves, for this country.

58:10.621 --> 58:14.022
You try and come over,
take it away from me?

58:14.024 --> 58:16.725
Not on my fucking watch.

58:20.064 --> 58:23.065
Sayonara, bam!

58:26.670 --> 58:27.769
That's it.

58:29.707 --> 58:32.908
Signing off, patriots,
stay strong.

58:50.661 --> 58:54.062
Yeah, that was pretty
fucking good, you fucking--

58:54.064 --> 58:57.933
You come here...
[imitates gun firing]

59:00.004 --> 59:03.238
Not on my watch. [chuckles]

59:04.108 --> 59:05.774
Not on my fucking watch!

59:06.277 --> 59:09.278
[imitates gun firing]

59:15.986 --> 59:17.319
Never look
in the camera, Ronnie.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.224
[Candy] So let's do it just
like we practiced, okay?

59:23.027 --> 59:24.226
-Yup.
-[Candy] Okay.

59:25.329 --> 59:27.262
[Bill] And action.

59:29.099 --> 59:30.632
[Candy]
Honey, I've been thinking.

59:31.769 --> 59:33.101
Oh, yeah? What? About what?

59:33.637 --> 59:34.903
[Candy] About last night.

59:35.072 --> 59:37.205
You didn't leave me satisfied.

59:37.775 --> 59:38.707
I didn't?

59:39.810 --> 59:42.277
You lasted two minutes tops.

59:42.279 --> 59:46.181
I think it's getting worse,
and your dick is too small.

59:46.984 --> 59:49.084
So you know you friend
Jack from work?

59:49.720 --> 59:51.753
Well, I invited him
over to show you

59:51.755 --> 59:53.155
how pathetic you are.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.091
Hey, sugar. Hey, buddy.

59:57.962 --> 01:00:05.167
-Look at all this ass.
-Ooh, yeah.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:07.035
[Candy] Let's get you
out of these clothes.

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:10.272
[Jack] Yeah, oh yeah.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.174
That's what a real
cock looks like.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.743
[Jack] Ah, baby. [gasps]

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.748
Yeah, baby, suck it.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:22.818
That's right, baby.

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:26.622
[loud moaning]

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.865
Suck it, baby. Suck it, yeah.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:38.867
[loud moaning]

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.736
Oh, suck that dick.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:41.903
Oh, baby.

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:47.042
[loud moaning]

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:51.413
I want to fuck, take this off.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.917
Show me. Oh, yeah.

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:57.386
-[Jack] Fuck you, baby.
-Oh, yeah.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:58.687
[Jack] Fuck that ass.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:59.721
[Candy] Get it up, honey.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.657
Can you get it up?

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:04.059
Can you do it,
can you get it up?

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:09.231
Oh, yeah. That's a real cock.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:14.736
-[loud moaning]
-Oh, oh yes!

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.139
Oh, that's it!

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.073
Oh, I'm coming!

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:20.809
[loud moaning]

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:28.850
Look at that pathetic
little thing.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.687
Look at you, you're nothing,

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:35.190
you're so sad, you're such
a pathetic little man.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.726
Oh, yes [screams].

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.430
Oh, yes, yes.

Got you, you fucking nigger.

[Bill] And, action.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.417
I thought you said
you were married.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.220
I could never stay
married to a man

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:46.555
with a dick that small.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:49.457
But I thought you liked the
car that I bought you, baby.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.962
Well, Antonio here loves
bending me over the hood.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.263
That's right, baby.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.466
This is how a real man
bends her over the hood.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:05.407
[Candy] Yeah, oh yeah!
[gasps] Yeah.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:08.510
Oh like that, like that, yeah.

[Bill] Cut.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:19.855
-Get down by the bed.
-What?

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.390
You want to get paid or what?

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:27.896
Don't chicken out on me, Ronnie.

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:51.519
Oh, yeah, that's it.
Are you ready, baby?

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:52.954
-[Antonio] Yeah, baby.
-You there?

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:54.189

I'm ready, yeah. [pants]

How do you like that dick?

[Candy] Ronnie...

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:41.303
Wait.

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:44.072
It was a shock, I know!

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:47.008
Ronnie, look at me!

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:55.483
You and me, we're a team,
right, you understand?

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:58.386
We just, we got to have
each other's backs.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.621
But I didn't sign up for that.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.189
But you're great at what you do

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:02.590
and we need you.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:12.200
Listen, we need to just
spend some time together

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.568
just you and me, don't we?

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:18.306
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:23.278
So tomorrow Bill's going
off to Ventura.

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:25.714
Come on over for a drink, okay?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:28.550
Okay, good.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:34.289
You did great, you did great.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.626
-Thank you.
-See you tomorrow.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:48.636
See you tomorrow.

[Ronnie chuckles] <i> You really</i>
<i> think it's funny?</i>

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:01.342
Well, you're either in AA or
some sort of religious kook.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.211
So which one is it, Ronnie?

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.212
Oh, it's neither,

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:07.215
I just don't
like the way that it tastes.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:08.850
Well, we're going
to change that.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:14.789
Salt, tequila, lime,
gimme your hand.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.265
Lick, drink, suck.

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:34.709
[Candy giggles]

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:38.897
Are you okay?

01:08:38.898 --> 01:08:40.548
The first one's always
the roughest. [laughs]

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.483
Can I kiss you?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.519
Yeah.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.538
You want to do some crystal,
it'll straighten you out?

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:09.277
No, I'm okay with the drinks.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.313
[loud snorting]

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:25.727
Let's go outside.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.846
[birds chirping]

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:54.422
-Can I tell you something?
-Yeah.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:56.591
You can tell me anything.

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:05.400
I want to do something
else with my life.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.237
Maybe get out of LA.

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:15.210
Yeah, me too.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:24.552
I could take you away, I could
take you away from all this.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.357
What do you think?

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:48.376
I really like you, Ronnie.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:54.315
Do you like me?

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.353
Yeah.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.719
Have you ever been with
a woman before?

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:35.990
Yeah.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.881
[lips smacking]

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:21.703

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:05.480
[heavy breathing]

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:10.818
[Candy] Uh, ooh!

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:14.956
[heavy breathing]

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.894
[soft moaning]

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:25.099
I love you.

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:30.405
I love you.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:36.177
[whimpering]

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:47.155
Whoa.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.491
[heavy panting]

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:58.866

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:38.706
[deep breathing]

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:02.797
How'd you sleep?

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:11.706
-Fine.
-I bet.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.043
Candy probably gave you
a little something.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.246
Gave you a free one, huh?

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:22.049
Yes, sir.

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:23.684
Well she might've given
it to you for free

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:26.854
but that's my wife.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:31.225
Look, it's not--

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.130
You want me to fuck you up?

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:44.171
-No.
-Then you got to pay.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:48.109
Okay, how much?

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:50.978
200 bucks.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.151
Can I get you a check?

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.323
Mm-hm.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:13.568
Go on, Ron, why don't
you get your clothes?

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:24.045
[suspenseful music]

[gun shots firing]

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.084
[customer] Can't you do
something about these guys?

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:04.785
There's nothing I can do,

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.054
I try to tell these guys
don't come in with--

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:10.291
-He's a fucking clown.
-I know, there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:12.893
Excuse me, are you a veteran?

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:15.930
-Yeah.
-What unit?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.967
54th battalion, Afghanistan.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.637
-[customer] Where?
-All over.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.740
[employee] That's
a First Gulf War uniform,

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:26.774
you look a little young, bud.

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:29.110
[customer] Stealing
valor there, junior?

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:31.746
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.115
Motherfucker.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:38.052

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:42.423
[exhales]

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:48.095
So a lot of people think
that conceal carry holders

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:52.033
are scary,
yeah they think they're scary,

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:54.268
well, you'd be right to
be scared of this.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:02.076
That's a fucking 38 Magnum,
it's real.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:06.347
Has enough power to
kill a grizzly.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.351
That's why the liberals
want it banned, yeah.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:12.019
But here's the thing,

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:19.026
when the shit hits the fan,
when the real bad guys take over

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.429
you're going to want us
on your side.

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:25.066
When the time comes you're
going to be begging us for help.

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:28.869
But here's the thing, we
don't have to do anything

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.004
for you liberal cucks.

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.773
You tried to take away
our second amendment.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:36.177
So when the fire comes,
you're going to burn.

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:43.751

[Ronnie] Yeah, you
want to be in it?

Fuck yeah, you want to know
what really pisses me off?

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:45.366
What offends me, all
these fucking sissies

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:48.269
who care more about safe
spaces on college campuses

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:52.139
than our right to
say what we want.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:55.075
If you want a safe space,
stay the fuck home.

All these fucking libtards
are all over the place.

01:22:23.406 --> 01:22:26.540
And this place is
a fucking snake pit.

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:29.076
They're marching,
screaming, you can hear 'em.

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:31.278
Amping up for their own
little snowflake rights.

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.950
I have my papers and
I did it the right way

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:37.318
and I'm here
in the United States

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.053
and I'm extremely patriotic.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:41.956
I love our president
and I just think people

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:45.059
who are not from this country
should, you know, leave.

01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:47.461
They just think they
can sneak in,

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.064
like that's not right, you know?

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:53.534
Thank you.

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:57.705

Patriots, live update,
I'm down in Anaheim

01:23:06.449 --> 01:23:09.216
you wouldn't believe
these libcucks down here.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:12.353
But Mr. Dalmain called
on us, so we've come.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:15.489
There's a lot of people who
are flat out anti-American.

01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:18.659
That's it for right now,
signing off, patriots.

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:21.762
Signing off in this.

[Chance] Get whatever
you want, it's on me.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:03.137
Thank you, you sure?

01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:06.373
Oh, absolutely.
I don't often get the chance

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.709
to meet subscribers who
have their own channel.

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:13.714
[ambient jazz music]

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:25.826
So, you're trying to spread
the word about real America?

01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:29.229
Trying to tell what's gone awry?

01:24:29.832 --> 01:24:32.633
Yes, sir, I mean that's
why I pretty much

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:36.654
started my channel, you know.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:38.672
All the problems we're
facing, immigrants, all that.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:42.543
Yeah, I think you
follow my views on

01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:45.279
identity-forming cultures,
the systemic

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:48.315
watering down of
the white nation state.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:55.789
How I see it, we got to
have real patriotism.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:59.159
You know, cause otherwise
anyone could come in here

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:00.627
and take this country away.

01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:05.466
To be honest with you,
I am sick of the blacks

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:07.801
and the Muslims, they're
telling us what to do.

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:09.403
[Chance] Yeah.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.138
Yeah, you're quite astute.

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:14.408
I can tell that the anger
in your videos is real.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:18.245
I'm sure that's part of
what makes 'em so popular.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:23.817
Thank you, Mr. Dalmain.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:29.756
Let me ask you
a question, Ronnie.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.761
How far are you willing to go?

01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:39.833
[ominous music]

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:41.368
What do you mean how far?

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:45.706
Well, our country, it's shifting

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:53.413
not just in terms of politics
or morality, but culturally.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.417
Europeans are the creators.

01:25:57.419 --> 01:26:01.522
They stoked the fires
of art and industry.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:07.628
But now we're losing the
battle on a population front.

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:15.903
All these Africans
and Pan-Asian peoples.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:21.808
Hispanics, they're here to stay.

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.513
We're in need of a great
cultural revolution.

01:26:27.283 --> 01:26:30.417
It's theirs or ours.

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:36.690
It takes an iron will to
build a great civilization,

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:41.228
and a small lapse in faith,
that could cost us everything.

01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:44.231
Faith in like God?

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:47.467
In our identity, our principles,

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:49.670
the DNA of European nations.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.641
And when it comes down
