00:16.892 --> 00:17.892
<i>A thief hunted!</i>

00:18.479 --> 00:19.602
<i>In a daring assault,</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:21.812
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka,</i>

00:22.413 --> 00:25.441
<i>boarded the warship
of cunning bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

00:25.840 --> 00:27.568
<i>to recover a stolen holocron</i>

00:27.821 --> 00:30.738
<i>containing a list
of the galaxy's force-sensitive children</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:32.606
<i>and future Jedi knights.</i>

00:33.158 --> 00:35.368
<i>After a desperate chase and duel
with the villain,</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:37.649
<i>Anakin and his troops defeated Bane</i>

00:37.774 --> 00:40.387
<i>but were forced
to evacuate his doomed vessel</i>

00:40.512 --> 00:42.059
<i>without the holocron.</i>

00:53.893 --> 00:55.605
How many made it off this time?

00:55.792 --> 00:56.792
Just us.

00:57.436 --> 00:58.436
Denal,

00:58.615 --> 01:00.680
good job frying that bounty hunter.

01:01.635 --> 01:03.750
- Let's get some grub.
- You hungry?

01:03.967 --> 01:05.167
I'll catch up.

01:05.825 --> 01:07.275
So what now?

01:07.585 --> 01:09.277
We get the injured
to the medical bay.

01:09.685 --> 01:12.267
General, there's something
I think you should see.

01:15.712 --> 01:17.649
Trooper, are you all right?

01:19.915 --> 01:21.865
Must've been hit in the head.

01:22.533 --> 01:23.583
It's blood, sir.

01:24.458 --> 01:26.252
And it sure isn't
from any of our men.

01:28.058 --> 01:29.658
Wait!
You're injured.

01:30.225 --> 01:31.549
That might be serious.

01:33.274 --> 01:34.677
You're no clone.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.077
Admiral, lock down
the hyperspace rings! Hurry!

02:01.726 --> 02:04.769
What could possibly have happened
since I last spoke with you?

02:07.284 --> 02:09.753
It's Bane.
Lock those rings now.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.676
- No, lock them all down. Hurry.
- Deactivating hyperspace rings.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.349
We'll have to inform the Council.

02:30.256 --> 02:33.069
It is most unfortunate
Bane was allowed to escape

02:33.489 --> 02:34.489
again.

02:34.614 --> 02:36.572
With access
to the names and locations

02:36.740 --> 02:38.908
of the most force-sensitive children
in the Republic.

02:39.228 --> 02:41.008
Inflict devastating damage

02:41.133 --> 02:43.415
on the Jedi Order he could.

02:43.870 --> 02:46.207
We've discovered
Bane's working with the separatists.

02:46.714 --> 02:48.841
There are thousands of children
on that list.

02:48.966 --> 02:50.419
Which will he go after first?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.745
Small chance there is,
through the force,

02:53.870 --> 02:55.770
the Council may detect them.

02:56.716 --> 03:00.716
I have delivered what you wanted.
The Jedi were no problem.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.810
Anything else I can help you with?

03:03.985 --> 03:06.095
I need test subjects.

03:06.735 --> 03:07.895
Choose four children

03:08.063 --> 03:09.576
and bring them to Mustafar.

03:10.187 --> 03:11.937
I will take care of them.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.389
Kidnapping innocent children?

03:16.275 --> 03:19.198
Seems like a small-time crime
for the likes of you.

03:19.577 --> 03:23.577
Among the children of the Jedi,
there are no innocents.

03:24.094 --> 03:25.252
Sure, sure.

03:26.121 --> 03:29.621
As long as I get paid,
it makes no difference to me.

03:33.221 --> 03:34.471
A jungle world.

03:35.277 --> 03:36.809
Dome cities I see.

03:37.964 --> 03:39.504
Rodia it is.

03:41.835 --> 03:43.771
A house in Kay Tap Square.

03:44.816 --> 03:45.966
I see it too.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.093
There's an ocean planet,

03:48.531 --> 03:50.531
home to Nautolans,

03:51.368 --> 03:52.565
Glee Anselm?

03:52.949 --> 03:54.059
Glee Anselm

03:54.443 --> 03:55.443
I see not.

03:55.845 --> 03:57.005
I sense...

03:58.064 --> 04:00.000
A place I've been to before.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.550
Waterfalls.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.075
Naboo.

04:03.396 --> 04:04.396
Jan-Gwa.

04:05.068 --> 04:06.918
A village, southern sector.

04:07.402 --> 04:09.206
Sense it strongly, I do.

04:09.505 --> 04:11.167
The Gungan child was screaming.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.357
The future you see,

04:13.865 --> 04:15.165
young Skywalker.

04:15.509 --> 04:16.714
To Naboo you must go.

04:17.623 --> 04:19.273
Cad Bane you will find.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.658
With you, take your Padawan.

04:22.405 --> 04:24.764
You are certain
there is no child on Glee Anselm?

04:25.145 --> 04:26.869
Into the shadow of the dark side

04:26.994 --> 04:28.534
taken the child was.

04:28.815 --> 04:31.205
Shrouded is his fate from us.

04:31.761 --> 04:33.079
Great the loss is.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.284
But more children in danger
there are.

04:36.855 --> 04:38.694
I shall leave for Rodia immediately.

04:39.232 --> 04:40.732
Find more younglings

04:41.010 --> 04:42.010
we will.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.250
Your son is strong with the force.

04:52.587 --> 04:54.683
He will make a fine Jedi.

04:55.288 --> 04:57.909
Master Ropal said
the day would come for him

04:58.034 --> 05:01.217
to go to the Temple,
but not for some time.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.908
Master Ropal was unaware

05:04.033 --> 05:05.965
of the danger your son is in.

05:06.260 --> 05:09.198
Jedi imposters
have been roaming the galaxy,

05:09.457 --> 05:11.507
stealing the future younglings.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.737
For your son's protection,

05:13.935 --> 05:15.698
I'm going to have to take him now.

05:15.823 --> 05:18.025
He is my only child.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.569
Look into this.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.690
It will relax you.

05:32.922 --> 05:35.084
Let's hope we have arrived in time.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.774
If you're looking for my son, Jedi,

06:01.982 --> 06:03.359
he's not here.

06:03.726 --> 06:04.826
Where is he?

06:06.565 --> 06:07.765
Open the door.

06:10.857 --> 06:12.288
You'll never get him.

06:12.904 --> 06:15.606
- Where is the bounty hunter?
- Bounty hunter?

06:16.302 --> 06:18.310
He was a Jedi.

06:20.015 --> 06:22.256
Jedi do not carry blasters.

06:22.763 --> 06:24.324
What have I done?

06:55.245 --> 06:56.415
General Skywalker,

06:56.794 --> 06:58.247
they told us you were coming.

06:58.372 --> 07:00.371
Has the Gungan family been notified?

07:01.045 --> 07:03.440
Captain Lunker here
is in charge of the operation.

07:03.565 --> 07:05.132
He will take you to Jan-Gwa city.

07:05.578 --> 07:07.312
Let me take the lead, Master.

07:07.437 --> 07:09.261
I've got a score to settle.

07:09.815 --> 07:11.180
All right, go with the Gungan.

07:11.585 --> 07:12.965
I'll be there shortly.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.064
Don't move, sleemo.

08:02.396 --> 08:05.818
You weren't the child
I was expecting to find.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.152
Obviously.

08:07.434 --> 08:09.947
You're quite clever, but naive.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.567
Looks like I win.

08:34.136 --> 08:36.722
I think I've earned the right
to wear this again.

08:45.685 --> 08:47.443
Your daughter is safe now.

08:47.655 --> 08:49.545
Do you really believe that?

08:59.225 --> 09:01.358
We know you've taken
at least two children.

09:01.483 --> 09:04.216
- Where are they?
- Beyond your reach.

09:04.341 --> 09:07.129
- Who are you working for?
- I work alone.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.871
It is only a matter of time
before we locate the holocron.

09:11.297 --> 09:13.218
Make it easier on yourself.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.847
What are you going to do, Jedi,
torture me?

09:17.525 --> 09:18.525
I think

09:18.775 --> 09:20.875
the fear of whoever you work for

09:21.311 --> 09:23.187
outweighs your fear of us.

09:24.305 --> 09:26.525
This conversation is over.

09:31.825 --> 09:34.740
We tore the ship apart.
There's no sign of the holocron

09:35.116 --> 09:36.216
or the kids.

09:36.675 --> 09:38.714
Did you check
the ship's navigation records?

09:38.839 --> 09:41.246
They were wiped clean
before he landed on Naboo.

09:41.902 --> 09:44.413
We'll have to use the force
to make him talk.

09:44.538 --> 09:46.835
I don't think Bane is that weak.

09:47.221 --> 09:50.297
Maybe if we all concentrated
on his mind together.

09:51.263 --> 09:53.930
Using the force to compel
a strong mind to cooperate

09:54.055 --> 09:55.789
is risky.

09:55.914 --> 09:59.014
There is a danger that his mind
could be destroyed in the process.

09:59.997 --> 10:01.350
Do we have another choice?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.988
You will take us to the holocron.

10:15.369 --> 10:17.991
Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.

10:18.472 --> 10:20.622
You will take us to the holocron.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.612
Forget it.

10:23.645 --> 10:26.019
You will take us to the holocron.

10:28.597 --> 10:29.878
I won't.

10:30.217 --> 10:32.548
And you will take us... now!

10:35.024 --> 10:36.324
I will take you.

10:38.147 --> 10:39.597
Get out of my head.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.190
Perhaps we should try... again.

10:52.863 --> 10:54.563
I've had enough of that.

10:55.543 --> 10:57.543
I'll take you to the holocron.

10:58.097 --> 11:00.784
You'll get your children back.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.389
The chancellor wants a report
on our progress.

11:13.514 --> 11:17.455
Tell him this is not Republic business.
It's an internal Jedi affair.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.208
I'm sorry to disagree, but as long as
the Jedi are acting as a military,

11:21.333 --> 11:23.205
we should report to the chancellor,

11:23.476 --> 11:25.736
even on internal matters
such as this.

11:25.861 --> 11:28.385
Well, then, I guess
you just volunteered to go.

11:28.510 --> 11:30.522
- Give the chancellor my regards.
- Wait a minute.

11:30.647 --> 11:32.941
I agree.
Report back here when you are finished.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.405
This could be a trap, Master.
You sure you don't need us to go?

11:38.676 --> 11:40.549
Of course it's a trap, Skywalker.

11:40.674 --> 11:43.243
I will contact you
when we find the children.

11:43.571 --> 11:45.798
What if they don't find those kids?

11:45.923 --> 11:47.773
They will, snips.
Come on.

11:59.172 --> 12:00.400
The coordinates.

12:00.525 --> 12:02.214
The coordinates are...

12:03.222 --> 12:05.730
673117,

12:05.855 --> 12:08.789
cross 7RB71.

12:09.288 --> 12:12.220
That will take us
into the far Outer Rim,

12:12.345 --> 12:13.440
neutral space.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.475
Do you want your holocron

12:15.855 --> 12:18.455
and your kids or not?

12:30.455 --> 12:31.540
Anakin,

12:31.665 --> 12:33.144
it is good to see you.

12:33.484 --> 12:34.784
Your Excellency.

12:38.907 --> 12:40.257
Excuse us, child.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.860
I understand you made
an important arrest

12:49.985 --> 12:51.911
in the plot to destroy the Jedi.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.318
Do you think a simple bounty hunter
could create such a plan?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.653
I believe someone else, someone
much more powerful was behind this.

13:00.374 --> 13:01.822
I don't think it was Dooku.

13:03.327 --> 13:06.910
And have you any clues
as to who it may be?

13:07.367 --> 13:08.537
Not yet, chancellor.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.491
Have patience, my boy.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.773
<i>There, there, child.</i>

13:29.750 --> 13:32.204
<i>Soon you will cry no more.</i>

13:33.070 --> 13:34.070
Master,

13:34.195 --> 13:38.195
subjects of this age rarely survive
the slave conditioning procedure.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.091
<i>And I'm afraid
the risk is necessary.</i>

13:41.420 --> 13:43.749
<i>The natural talent
these children possess</i>

13:43.874 --> 13:46.938
<i>is too great to be wasted
by the Jedi.</i>

13:50.114 --> 13:51.800
<i>I foresee an army</i>

13:51.925 --> 13:55.101
<i>of force-talented spies
in my service,</i>

13:55.226 --> 13:56.705
<i>trained in the dark side</i>

13:56.830 --> 14:00.403
<i>to peer into every corner
of the galaxy from afar.</i>

14:00.597 --> 14:03.399
<i>And my enemies would be helpless</i>

14:03.524 --> 14:05.227
<i>against such vision.</i>

14:07.838 --> 14:10.738
<i>If the surgery fails,
I will have lost nothing.</i>

14:36.040 --> 14:37.452
We'll be fine, Cody.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.866
- Stay here and watch the ship.
- Yes, sir.

14:39.991 --> 14:41.841
I'll keep the ship running.

14:50.495 --> 14:52.745
I do not sense any children nearby.

14:53.201 --> 14:54.351
Neither do I.

14:56.509 --> 14:58.755
Where are you keeping the children?

14:58.880 --> 15:00.656
The children are safe.

15:01.003 --> 15:02.248
But first,

15:02.373 --> 15:04.519
there is your precious holocron.

15:08.426 --> 15:10.026
Let me get it for you.

15:10.548 --> 15:12.198
No more of your tricks.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.656
Blast!

15:16.042 --> 15:18.343
You certainly stepped
in it this time.

15:33.338 --> 15:35.123
So long, Jedi.

15:40.826 --> 15:42.191
Now what do we do?

15:58.360 --> 16:00.760
Well, the piloting systems
are clean.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.909
- Check the landing gear?
- Double-checked it.

16:04.143 --> 16:07.599
I have the feeling Master Windu
and Obi-Wan could've used our help.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.560
I don't like being out of the action
either,

16:09.685 --> 16:11.352
but somebody's got to do this job.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.885
And it always ends up being us.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.152
Bane picked up a lot
of volcanic ash on his travels.

16:21.030 --> 16:22.780
What have you got, Artoo?

16:23.167 --> 16:25.702
Looks like Bane erased
his navigation records,

16:25.827 --> 16:27.869
but not his fuel computer.

16:28.037 --> 16:29.037
So?

16:29.440 --> 16:31.732
If we cross the list of planets
we know he visited

16:31.857 --> 16:33.458
with the distance he traveled...

16:33.688 --> 16:37.503
We may be able to calculate
where else he went. That's a new one.

16:37.671 --> 16:40.614
It's an old Jedi trick
we use to track down smugglers.

16:40.739 --> 16:42.091
Okay, let's see.

16:42.379 --> 16:45.130
Glee Anselm, Rodia, Mustafar,

16:45.255 --> 16:46.971
- Naboo.
- Wait.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.515
Mustafar?
There were no children on Mustafar.

16:50.161 --> 16:53.770
It's a mining world, very remote.
Probably stopped there to refuel.

16:54.155 --> 16:55.755
That explains the ash.

16:56.028 --> 16:58.148
But it was six systems
out of his way.

16:58.273 --> 17:00.660
Maybe he met up
with whoever he's working for.

17:00.785 --> 17:02.195
It's worth a look, isn't it?

17:03.818 --> 17:06.068
Anything to get out of this hangar.

17:15.684 --> 17:17.284
I've got the holocron.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.101
Anytime, Cody.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.694
We're coming up on Mustafar.

17:43.327 --> 17:45.377
Artoo, begin the landing cycle.

17:57.126 --> 17:59.052
A starship is approaching.

17:59.177 --> 18:00.962
It is not the bounty hunter.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.772
<i>This was unexpected.</i>

18:04.230 --> 18:07.130
<i>Evacuate the children
to my secondary facility.</i>

18:07.539 --> 18:10.096
<i>I'm afraid this installation
is lost.</i>

18:10.473 --> 18:12.974
<i>We must destroy all the evidence.</i>

18:13.311 --> 18:16.728
<i>Turn off the gravity supports
and let the building sink into the lava.</i>

18:17.211 --> 18:20.579
<i>- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Just do as I say.</i>

18:31.833 --> 18:33.829
You sure this is the right place?

18:33.954 --> 18:35.504
We're gonna find out.

18:47.301 --> 18:49.101
I sense something, Master,

18:49.461 --> 18:50.961
and I don't like it.

18:51.346 --> 18:53.196
It's the dark side, Ahsoka.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.292
This is the right place.

19:02.014 --> 19:03.200
Did you hear that?

19:03.325 --> 19:06.550
Yeah, I heard it.
The question is, where are they?

19:10.377 --> 19:11.377
This way.

19:14.698 --> 19:16.683
All gravity supports off.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.251
Quick, the Jedi are coming.

19:26.444 --> 19:29.717
Turn out the lights. Hurry, hurry.

19:43.393 --> 19:44.566
We're too late.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.051
I can sense they're still here.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.008
Be careful of the younglings.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.769
I know!

20:42.371 --> 20:45.251
- The panel's fried.
- Where's Artoo?

21:00.565 --> 21:01.565
Be quiet.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.447
It's okay.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.999
The base was completely destroyed,
Master,

21:25.167 --> 21:27.126
and so was any clue
who's behind this.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.463
Most unfortunate this is.

21:30.977 --> 21:32.797
And we still have Bane.

21:36.390 --> 21:37.804
He got away again?

21:38.235 --> 21:40.495
The important thing is
that the children are safe

21:40.620 --> 21:42.567
and we've recovered the holocron.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.142
The list is intact,

21:44.377 --> 21:46.577
and there is no evidence
it was copied.

21:46.702 --> 21:48.972
Still, the future of all Jedi

21:49.360 --> 21:50.581
uncertain is.

21:51.428 --> 21:53.078
Move forward cautiously

21:53.610 --> 21:54.654
we must.

21:55.305 --> 22:01.522
