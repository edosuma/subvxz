NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues…

00:03.461 --> 00:06.089
Back out the door
before one of us gets reckless.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.298
He had a shotgun!

00:07.382 --> 00:09.092
He coulda killed those people on the bus!

00:09.175 --> 00:10.677
Hey, easy, Mick! Easy, easy!

00:10.760 --> 00:13.346
I won't have no drunk covering my back.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.682
She's with me, Chuck.

00:16.975 --> 00:20.895
All right! That's it! I want everybody
to put your hands on the bar right now.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.981
-Put your hands on the bar.
-Freeze!

00:23.064 --> 00:26.192
(gunshots)

00:26.276 --> 00:28.903
I'm no cop, Frank. I wanna take my wife

00:28.987 --> 00:30.864
and my babies
and get the hell out of here.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.410
(indistinct chatter and laughing)

00:43.376 --> 00:46.212
I can well understand
your spirited feelings

00:46.296 --> 00:50.300
towards spring's final,
albeit belated, arrival.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.801
Nevertheless, be forewarned.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.722
Everybody out there is gonna feel
just as feisty as yourselves.

00:55.805 --> 00:56.723
WOMAN: I don't know.

00:56.806 --> 01:00.185
Statistically speaking,
expect a 25% increase, felony-wise,

01:00.268 --> 01:03.730
-30-35%, misdemeanor-wise.
-I don't feel feisty.

01:03.813 --> 01:08.485
From us that means extra care,
extra alertness, extra professionalism.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.362
It does not mean drag racing our units,

01:11.988 --> 01:16.409
siestas in the sunshine,
and/or flirtatious interludes

01:16.493 --> 01:18.119
with, no doubt,

01:19.079 --> 01:22.665
scantily dressed individuals
of the female persuasion.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.959
(laughing)

01:25.043 --> 01:26.252
Next item.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.089
Item 12.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.466
Three memoranda from Division

01:31.549 --> 01:33.927
concerning a joint meeting Thursday next,

01:34.594 --> 01:36.888
the Black Police Officers Association,

01:36.971 --> 01:40.433
the Hispanic Police Officers Coalition,

01:41.059 --> 01:43.812
the Jewish Police Officers Caucus.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.688
(scattered laughter)

01:45.772 --> 01:50.276
Please endeavor to attend.
Please endeavor to contribute.

01:52.028 --> 01:55.490
Item 13 regards blood.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.661
(all murmuring and groaning)

01:59.744 --> 02:01.621
As you are no doubt well aware,

02:01.704 --> 02:05.375
the county blood bank
remains woefully understocked,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.711
and, given our particular indebtedness
to that life-saving institution,

02:08.795 --> 02:11.506
what say we find the time
in the next few days

02:11.589 --> 02:14.843
to stop by, roll up our sleeves,

02:14.926 --> 02:16.511
and give a little back?

02:16.594 --> 02:20.014
I'm gonna be booked next week.
Can't do that.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.141
MAN: I'm booked.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.811
All right. The last item…

02:26.312 --> 02:28.773
concerns the ongoing
armed robbery situation

02:28.857 --> 02:30.859
plaguing the Transportation Authority.

02:31.901 --> 02:36.698
To date, they have had 18 incidents
on bus and subway cars.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.577
It's apparent this perpetrator's getting
more cocksure all the time.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.537
Per Transport's request,

02:42.620 --> 02:45.039
we're pulling six plainclothes teams
to assist,

02:46.040 --> 02:49.210
so check for change-of-duty assignments
posted upstairs.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.047
East Side park units, write this one down.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.468
-3727 Von Steuben Avenue…
-That's us.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.845
…needs crowd control.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.889
All East Side park units.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.599
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.475
Hey!

03:06.436 --> 03:07.729
Let's be careful out there.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.690
I swear, I haven't even had breakfast yet.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.025
Would you stop complaining?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.110
I'm not complaining.
I'm simply stating a fact.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.070
I'll tell you,
I'm meant for better things.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.989
It's gonna happen to me out there today.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.283
Well, stick with me, and we'll find them.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.827
We'll never get to breakfast.
I'll guarantee you that.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.538
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:27.707
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:27.790 --> 03:31.377
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:38.551 --> 03:42.472
(theme music playing)

04:39.070 --> 04:42.073
(calm music playing)

04:56.713 --> 05:00.341
(indistinct chatter)

05:21.571 --> 05:23.656
I don't need to write it down, man.
Just say it.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.368
Ah, you got that? Three black, two cream,
two cream, and sugar.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.619
Yeah, yeah.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.663
(man muttering indistinctly)

05:31.247 --> 05:33.082
That's the last
you'll ever see of that guy.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.126
Maybe, maybe not.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.421
You wouldn't want to make
a little wager on it, would you?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.256
Such as?

05:40.923 --> 05:42.550
Uh, I'll bet you lunch.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.802
You're on.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.263
Hey, man! What's going on here?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.515
Why you want to know?
You in the F.B.I. or something?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.434
-No. I just want to know.
-We don't know yet.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.479
-Keep your mouth shut. Get out of here.
-We're just trying to help out.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.106
-You got a name?
-No name. No name, man. No name.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.610
-What's up?
-Two more dead still upstairs.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.154
Somebody stepped real hard
on the heroin he sold 'em.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.698
-Strychnine?
-Yep.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.741
That him?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.870
No. He just made the buy for 'em.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.622
One of the victims was his girlfriend.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.791
-(sighs)
-Nice.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.086
Nice day. Almost beach weather.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.713
RENKO: Wanna go to the beach?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.423
HILL: Yeah. Let's get out of here.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.135
POLICE MAN:
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.555
(bangs on door)

06:30.973 --> 06:33.684
-Weeks?
-It's Goldblume, Weeks.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.232
This all of it?

06:39.315 --> 06:41.859
The coroner took two bags
for lab analysis.

06:41.943 --> 06:42.944
Right.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.029
Well, we'll take it from here.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.491
I was wondering
how we're gonna proceed on this.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.952
I wouldn't worry about it, Sergeant.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.916
Well, it seems to me, bad heroin means
we notify Street Drug Analysis,

06:56.999 --> 06:59.001
free clinic, County Health.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.838
-You know, get the word out.
-We got it covered, man, okay?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.173
MAN: Don't push.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.343
DISPATCHER (over radio):
<i>Unit 02, Unit 02, see the woman--</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:09.637
RENKO: Oh, Lord have mercy. That's us.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.432
Bobby, get in the car. Let's go.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.937
-HILL: Get out of the way!
-WOMAN: Hey!

07:18.646 --> 07:20.648
RENKO:
All right, you people. Get out of the way.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.442
Just get out of the way of this car!

07:23.151 --> 07:25.486
(siren wailing)

07:28.406 --> 07:31.033
(action music playing)

07:33.369 --> 07:34.996
(tires screeching)

07:50.678 --> 07:53.055
-WOMAN: About time.
-You the lady who called in?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.558
-Over an hour and a half ago.
-Well, we just got the call.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.060
Poor thing has been screaming
her lungs out all morning.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.104
This is the last time
she gonna be pullin' this.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.648
You say a woman left her kids
in the apartment unattended?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.317
That's what I just told you.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.318
All the time.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.028
I told that to your station an hour ago.

08:07.111 --> 08:10.072
-Police officers. Open up, please.
-She ain't in there.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.282
She's out.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.035
I saw her go out all dressed up
to meet some you-know-what.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.995
Why don't you all
go back to your apartments?

08:16.078 --> 08:19.457
Police officers. Will you open up, please!
Anyone with a key on the premises?

08:19.540 --> 08:22.210
-Oh my Lord!
-(groans)

08:24.295 --> 08:25.129
Thank you.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.131
(bang on door)

08:28.758 --> 08:31.260
-Ah, will you look at this?
-No, hey, hey. Okay.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.263
-Hey. Say, little fella.
-Don't cry.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.600
-Little man, it's okay.
-Little baby, what's your name?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.561
-April.
-April? What's your name?

08:40.645 --> 08:43.814
-You okay?
-RENKO: You are dirty, April.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.026
-Is there a rag or something, please?
-RENKO: What's the matter with you?

08:47.109 --> 08:48.361
Thank you.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.863
I'm just gonna wipe this off. There we go.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.575
Yeah. There we go. That's pretty good.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.287
Come on here. Come on. Come on.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.623
Everything is gonna be okay.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.500
RENKO: Get the peanut butter off of you.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.460
-Is that the mother?
-That's her.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.629
RENKO: Got any bread?
I could make a sandwich.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.007
Aw, that's so cute, now,
you little beautiful thing, you.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.469
Okay, you think you could stay with them
and change their diapers and clean 'em up

09:13.553 --> 09:15.137
while we try to locate the mother?

09:15.221 --> 09:18.516
I've done enough. I-I don't think
I want to be any more involved in this.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.561
Lady, you're already involved.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.146
-She's down the street in the tavern.
-The mother?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.440
That's right. That's where she goes.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.777
Then why didn't someone say something
before we broke the door in?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.863
I don't believe it. Watch out.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.450
What happened to you Friday?
I thought you were gonna drop by.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.619
MAN: I told you I had
some business to take care of.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.663
Business? What kind of business?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.665
Just business, baby. That's all.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.334
-More important than me?
-You know that's not true.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.170
You know that.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.885
MAN: Pay him no mind, he might go away.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.846
Excuse me. Are you Shirret Anders?

09:56.929 --> 09:59.765
Would you please step outside?
We'd like to talk to you for a minute.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.560
You are Shirret Anders?

10:02.643 --> 10:05.062
Why don't you back off, man,
and get the hell out of here.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.149
-Come on, please.
-It's okay. It's okay.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.037
Take off that badge sometime, white meat.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.209
One more word out of you, my friend,
you're going to County Emergency.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.137
She could've called, but she didn't.
I just went ahead.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.682
-She has the key.
-She said the babysitter didn't show up.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.142
Is that right?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.602
Listen, in the future, Shirret,

10:44.685 --> 10:47.229
you don't leave your children alone.
You understand?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.316
Now, we're gonna be back
to check up on you.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.611
Okay, now, you go on upstairs
and tend to your babies.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.203
RENKO: "My babysitter didn't show up."
What's wrong with these people?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.872
They leave their children all day long
in those apartments.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.166
Renko, Renko. She's all of 19, man.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.795
She's on welfare with two babies
and no life to live.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.214
Why can't you be a little more
understanding about it?

11:13.297 --> 11:16.342
I understand. I understand
maybe she should've thought about that

11:16.425 --> 11:18.052
before she started crankin' 'em out.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.180
-It don't work that way, my friend.
-Oh, it don't, huh?

11:21.263 --> 11:23.891
(distant siren wailing)

11:26.143 --> 11:27.978
(woman talking indistinctly over phone)

11:28.062 --> 11:31.440
Look, lady, you can ameliorate
the situation yourself

11:31.524 --> 11:34.735
by merely lowering your window shades.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.405
Three undercover officers on the same bus?

11:37.863 --> 11:40.032
Who are they protecting, each other?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.702
(phone ringing)

11:42.785 --> 11:44.537
(indistinct chatter)

11:47.581 --> 11:48.666
GOLDBLUME: Mm-hmm.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.548
Been on the telephone
all morning, so we hear.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.590
Hold on.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.511
-That's right.
-No, that's wrong.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.305
You keep your nose and your face
out of what you don't know.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.682
GOLDBLUME: I know enough.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.892
What's going on, Weeks?

12:09.019 --> 12:10.688
Into my office. You, too, Henry.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.778
Hold on. I'll talk to you later.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.698
The word's out on the street already.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.367
Not a junkie on the Hill
doesn't know it's rat-kick out there,

12:23.451 --> 12:25.911
not that that's gonna make
much difference to most of 'em.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.414
So, what's your problem
with the investigating officers

12:28.497 --> 12:30.458
notifying the proper agencies?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.085
I'll tell you what the problem is.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.378
Look, both of you.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.172
Narcotics runs its own shop up here.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.131
That's understood.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.799
But it does not own the Hill,

12:38.883 --> 12:41.761
and it doesn't walk all over
other personnel trying to do their jobs.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.638
You got problems, you bring 'em in here.
Understood?

12:44.722 --> 12:45.556
Right.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.643
They got the kid waiting for you
in Interrogation.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.936
He's all yours.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.148
Right.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.365
They just love it.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.369
Nothing like a little terror in
the streets to bring up the collar count.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.746
They're a breed apart, Henry.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.623
Yep.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.421
You know if we got support from Division
in putting out the word?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.631
No support.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.344
Four kids are dead from this.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.471
Frank?

13:25.554 --> 13:29.517
It's six dead, Henry,
and it's solely Narcotics' operation.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.519
I'm sorry. Division.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.354
I don't believe this.

13:37.733 --> 13:42.863
They're concerned our interference
might impede their nailing the pushers.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.533
Now, what Division means is that

13:45.616 --> 13:48.118
a couple of dozen dead junkies
isn't worth the trouble.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.829
I mean, it's a public service.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.498
I wish I could say no to that,
Henry, but I can't.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.961
In the meantime, we'll do what we can
to notify the street people.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.921
This is wrong, Frank.

13:59.672 --> 14:04.093
I know, Henry, but there isn't a hell
of a lot more I can do about it.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.558
(door slams)

14:16.105 --> 14:18.732
WASHINGTON: Hey, babe,
do you see Belker in the back of the bus?

14:18.816 --> 14:21.068
LARUE: Hey, I'm having trouble
just seeing the bus.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.203
Rotten way to make a buck, man.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.205
Hey, it's part of the J-O-B, babe.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.000
(police radio, indistinct)

14:38.085 --> 14:40.421
It's stupid, man.
It's a total waste of time.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.256
I'm bored silly.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.301
-(horn honking)
-Hey, green light, babe.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.052
-All right.
-You really hurt yourself

14:47.136 --> 14:48.470
for a change last night, huh?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.723
There's seats back there.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.937
-Look at him. He looks like a pervert.
-Look at that beard!

14:58.188 --> 15:00.107
Let's go back over here.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.820
(women talking indistinctly)

15:07.615 --> 15:10.284
I don't know
what they've let driving on these buses.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.831
Yo, Belker! Lunch break, babe.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.916
We're going in.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.419
(happy grunting)

15:24.965 --> 15:26.717
WOMAN: A fried chick, please!

15:30.304 --> 15:31.805
Mick, you gotta buy something,

15:31.889 --> 15:33.599
or I can't let you take up a stool.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.562
Okay. Would you bring me
a glass of water, hot?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.982
Big spender. A real Gotrocks.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.651
(growls)

15:45.486 --> 15:46.862
(whistling)

15:48.906 --> 15:51.158
It's a gift from my new squeeze.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.912
She's a stew. Man, she's killing me.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.664
Flies nights, sleeps days,

15:56.747 --> 15:59.917
and all she wants to do with her time off
is boogie all night long.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.380
-You ever do a stew?
-Couldn't say, man.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.384
Hey, man. Something bothering you?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.510
Yeah.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.053
You.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.348
-Drinkin' a lot these days.
-This? Come on.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.184
It's-It's just the hair of the dog.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.145
Look at you, man. Your paws are shaking.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.855
Don't get righteous with me, Neal.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.275
-We've closed too many bars together.
-Yeah. Off-duty.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.320
You never see me drinkin'
on the job, man. Never.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.488
What are you, my mother?

16:29.571 --> 16:33.534
Closer than that, man. I'm your partner.
Hey, look, man.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.203
I don't give a damn
what you do on your own time,

16:36.286 --> 16:38.622
but on my time,
you better be taking care of business,

16:38.706 --> 16:42.001
which you can't be doing when you got
your lips wrapped around a pint. You dig?

16:42.084 --> 16:45.087
I can give this up anytime, my friend.
Anytime.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.755
-Yeah, sure.
-That's right.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.551
-How's Saturday night?
-Sounds fine.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.511
-Bobby?
-I don't know.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.388
He'll be there.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.099
Just 'cause you broke up,
that's no reason to crawl into a hole.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.226
-Ah, man. Okay, okay.
-This is a good group here.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.728
You're not gonna miss it.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.604
-All right.
-Come on, Bobby.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.981
I said okay!

17:04.064 --> 17:06.942
All right. I'll bring some champagne
or Ripple or something.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.361
Now, you just bring yourself.
Here's what I got in mind.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.947
We're gonna take some steaks that I got,
broil 'em up,

17:12.031 --> 17:15.075
and get a bottle of sauvignon cabernet
and drink that.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.536
-Then we're gonna get in the old hot tub.
-Hot tub?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.954
I've never been in a hot tub.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.790
You know you have to go naked.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.918
Am I one of the boys,
or am I one of the boys?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.170
-Yeah.
-Well.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.298
You may be one of the boys, but you're
a lot prettier than my last partner.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.426
Not prettier than my Perez here.
Bigger maybe.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.512
Excuse me, boys. Nature call.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.350
You don't have a hot tub.
What are you talking about?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.770
I got a bathtub. I got attachments.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.854
(kissing sound)

17:46.065 --> 17:47.941
Want to keep your hands to yourself,
Cooper?

17:48.025 --> 17:49.318
What did I do?

17:49.401 --> 17:50.903
You're so hot for body contact?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.946
Let's go.
Come on. I'll give you body contact.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.573
-Come on, Bates.
-BATES: Come on.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.533
You wouldn't hit somebody
smaller than you.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.910
Hey, partner. Let it go.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.453
We gotta ride.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.914
BATES: Look, I can handle
my own beefs, Joe.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.333
You want to try me or what?

18:05.709 --> 18:06.960
I dream about it, Lucille.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.546
Hey, why don't you just sit down
and order your lunch?

18:09.630 --> 18:10.923
Come on. What do you say?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.468
Touchy.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.974
I'm okay, okay? I'm just fine.
I'm okay. I'll see you at the car.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.772
She's a feisty little heifer,
but she couldn't take him.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.273
Don't bet on it.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.943
Bet she can take you.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.069
(chuckles)

18:39.618 --> 18:41.662
(muffled) What do you say?
You want to go to work?

18:41.745 --> 18:44.581
What did you have for lunch, Belker?
Sewage?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.416
(growls)

18:47.876 --> 18:49.128
Whew.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.216
-(high-pitched) What is your name?
-(trumpeting)

18:54.299 --> 18:56.593
Officer, she left 'em again,

18:56.677 --> 18:58.762
just as soon as you boys
were out the door.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.932
I don't want to hear it.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.644
Look, could you just take this stuff
and stay with the kids?

19:05.727 --> 19:06.979
We're gonna go get the mother.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.939
Damn!

19:09.022 --> 19:11.316
(comedy music playing)

19:11.400 --> 19:13.110
(indistinct chatter)

19:18.323 --> 19:21.618
I think you'd better come on outside
so we can talk over this situation.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.497
Shirret, you can't keep
leaving your kids alone.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.708
Why don't you leave her be, brother?

19:28.375 --> 19:31.086
Now come on outside
so we can talk this problem over,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.504
so we can get it settled.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.048
It ain't no problem.
Lady next door is looking after 'em.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.717
-You can ask her.
-We did.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.345
Now, if you want me to arrest your butt
for child abandonment, I will.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.682
But it'd be a lot easier
if you'd just come along voluntarily.

19:43.765 --> 19:47.436
-You better let her arm go, brother.
-I am not your brother!

19:48.020 --> 19:50.397
And if you don't shut up,
I'll run your butt in, too.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.403
You can make it hard
or you can make it easy,

19:56.486 --> 19:58.989
but we're gonna take you and the kids in.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.490
You can't take my babies.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.326
My babies is all I got.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.328
You should've thought of that before now.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.915
It's not up to us anymore.
It's up to the welfare agency.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.376
She's with me, Chuck,

20:11.460 --> 20:13.420
and she don't go nowhere she don't want.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.838
-(bang)
-(glass shattering)

20:14.922 --> 20:18.550
All right! That's it! I want everybody
to put your hands on the bar right now!

20:18.634 --> 20:19.718
Put your hands on the bar!

20:19.801 --> 20:21.345
-BOBBY: Come on!
-Get 'em up there!

20:22.888 --> 20:25.557
I said get your hands
on the bar right now!

20:27.184 --> 20:30.354
All right, Bobby, you call a unit
and ambulance for this big guy here.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.314
-Get 'em up.
-Shirret!

20:33.649 --> 20:36.276
-Come on.
-I better go with them, honey.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.321
Come on.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.743
I want y'all to keep your hands
on this bar till I'm out of here.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.703
Get your hands on the bar
till I'm out of here.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.426
(sighs)

21:03.345 --> 21:04.346
Uh-huh.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.643
Brazilian blend with a little, uh,
touch of Colombian for body.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.312
Ooh, you have an amazing nose, Howard.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.607
-(laughs) Thanks, Phil.
-Why don't you have a cup?

21:15.691 --> 21:17.192
Uh, don't mind if I do.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.613
I need a little bracer.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.243
(sighs): It was a long night.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.079
Oh, that hostage situation on Margate?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.123
No.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.624
Uh…

21:33.750 --> 21:35.836
To be frank, Phil,

21:36.878 --> 21:38.922
I spent the entire night with a woman.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.550
-You, too?
-Hmm.

21:42.884 --> 21:46.555
-Lorraine Duval.
-Oh, that's a nice handle.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.181
It's kismet, Phil.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.018
We rode up in the elevator together,

21:52.311 --> 21:54.479
and, uh-- and then it turns out…

21:54.563 --> 21:57.024
that she lives
just three doors down from me.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.819
Well, anyway, we went
to our respective apartments

22:00.902 --> 22:04.197
and, uh, to make a long story short,

22:05.157 --> 22:07.326
her key broke off in the lock,

22:08.118 --> 22:11.872
and I was in my uniform,
so I blew her lock off with my .357.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.750
And we got to talking.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.713
Well, it turns out
that she is a translator

22:19.796 --> 22:21.757
for the Belgian Consulate.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.634
Tall and, uh…

22:25.886 --> 22:27.137
shapely.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.139
Auburn tresses.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.682
-(sighs)
-(giggles)

22:30.766 --> 22:34.061
Hmm. A master's degree
from Georgetown University, and--

22:34.144 --> 22:36.730
And a former artist's model in Paris.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.776
I mean, she is a very, uh…

22:40.859 --> 22:42.069
(chuckles)

22:42.819 --> 22:44.279
worldly woman.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.783
Hmm. Well, then she'd certainly
appreciate this, Howard.

22:47.866 --> 22:52.037
You know, last Sunday, Grace and I
took her four-wheel up to the country

22:52.120 --> 22:54.956
and went nude horseback riding.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.710
Oh. (snickering)

22:58.794 --> 23:00.170
I'm still a little chafed…

23:00.253 --> 23:01.797
(laughs)

23:01.880 --> 23:03.215
…but it was worth it.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.511
Hey, maybe you and Miss Duval
would care to join us sometime.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.888
No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking, Phil.

23:09.971 --> 23:14.393
But believe me,
we just talked the entire night.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.896
I showed her my dueling pistol.

23:19.022 --> 23:19.940
Then we…

23:20.816 --> 23:24.236
we went up on the roof
and watched the sunrise.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.782
I haven't had this…

23:29.866 --> 23:32.744
this sense of my essence, Phil,

23:33.537 --> 23:34.746
since, uh…

23:35.455 --> 23:37.541
since before I…

23:37.624 --> 23:38.875
I broke up with Audra.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.253
Oh! Howard.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.171
(laughs)

23:44.089 --> 23:45.799
Eh, women. What are we without them?

23:45.882 --> 23:48.009
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

23:48.093 --> 23:49.219
Excuse me.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.012
(clears throat)

23:54.724 --> 23:57.602
-Where's his paperwork?
-They're writing him up now.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.563
Another 10 minutes, if you'd like to wait.

23:59.646 --> 24:00.814
It's okay.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.658
Mr. Davis,
I'm your public defender of record.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.034
My name's Davenport.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.913
You're charged with rape assault.
Is that correct?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.086
Were your rights read to you
by the arresting officers?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.382
Did you say anything
to the arresting officers?

24:30.927 --> 24:32.762
What caused the injuries to your face?

24:32.846 --> 24:34.139
I didn't say nothing.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.518
Them pigs just grabbed me, pulled me down,

24:39.186 --> 24:40.770
started slamming away.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.482
I didn't say nothing.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.359
I didn't do nothing.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.614
Okay, Mr. Davis.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.283
I'll be right back.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.872
(phone rings)

24:58.955 --> 25:00.874
(typewriter clacking)

25:01.875 --> 25:03.960
Your suspect, Mr. Davis.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.962
Why wasn't he taken to County Emergency?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.882
-It's pretty simple, ma'am.
-His eye is practically swollen shut.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.968
He didn't want to go, ma'am. We asked him.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.679
Then those injuries
were sustained during his arrest?

25:14.763 --> 25:16.890
Ma'am, he resisted arrest,

25:16.973 --> 25:19.434
not to mention the fact
that he assaulted both of us.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.894
What's the problem, counselor?

25:21.686 --> 25:24.189
The problem's a battered suspect, Furillo,

25:24.272 --> 25:25.440
and who knows what else

25:25.524 --> 25:28.276
once these two gentlemen
kindly produce an arrest report.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.154
-It's almost done, Captain.
-Okay.

25:32.989 --> 25:33.949
May we?

25:38.328 --> 25:41.831
Since you have an interest in the suspect,
I thought I'd fill you in.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.710
He's being charged with rape,
statutory rape, object rape,

25:45.794 --> 25:47.087
assault with a deadly weapon,

25:47.170 --> 25:49.256
resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.633
-Look, Furillo--
-Before you put me in my place,

25:51.716 --> 25:54.594
I think you should know
this Mr. Davis tied the victim,

25:54.678 --> 25:57.430
a 15-year-old named Estelle Hernandez,

25:57.514 --> 26:00.767
to a chain-link fence
near the underpass in Van Buren Park,

26:00.850 --> 26:02.686
-raped her, sodomized her…
-Frank.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.605
…tortured her with lit cigarettes,
raped her again with a bottle.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.942
Officers further observed streams of blood
running down the victim's legs.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.068
That's enough!

26:14.698 --> 26:15.782
I'm sorry,

26:16.908 --> 26:19.661
but you assumed those two cops
out there were the heavies.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.124
More than that, I don't want you anywhere
near that animal.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.542
(scoffs)

26:29.838 --> 26:32.299
That's a little old-fashioned,
wouldn't you say?

26:32.382 --> 26:35.343
Maybe. I've got a lot
of old-fashioned ideas about you,

26:35.427 --> 26:37.887
so you can turn this case
over to someone else. All right?

26:38.805 --> 26:40.348
I don't think I can do that.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.060
See ya.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.690
(door slams)

26:56.156 --> 26:58.617
What the hell does that mean,
"inconclusive"?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.869
-Here you go. Here you go, Shirret.
-Thank you.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.122
You mean they have to run the whole series
again? Ah, geez.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.875
Can't we find a doctor
who'll do it right the first time?

27:08.293 --> 27:11.004
No, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm not yelling at you.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.466
You're gonna take him in now?

27:15.342 --> 27:16.384
Where?

27:17.302 --> 27:18.928
Well, call me as soon as they're done.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.057
Rachel, I don't care. Just call me.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.517
Yeah.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.812
Everything all right, Henry?

27:29.105 --> 27:34.277
Ah, yeah. You know, Ray,
little ones have such delicate systems.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.446
They sneeze,
you got to race 'em off to the doctor.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.697
I know what you mean.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.451
I heard something about some tests.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.829
Yeah, my youngest, Josh,
he's a little run-down.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.875
Actually, he looks like hell.
Dark circles, tired all the time.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.378
So, they're running a bunch of tests
on him at St. John's.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.798
He's probably a little anemic.
That's all, Henry.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.634
It's funny. The little guy'll be sittin'
there talking to you,

27:57.717 --> 28:00.220
and all of a sudden
he's asleep, mid-sentence.

28:00.970 --> 28:01.930
It's a little scary.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.099
Happens all the time, Henry.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.644
You know, when my Joselito
was four or five years old,

28:07.727 --> 28:10.230
-the doctors had to put him on--
-Excuse me. I've gotta go.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.731
Henry, he's going to be all right.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.609
I can't sit here while they're sticking
my kid full of needles.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.571
(children chattering, laughing)

28:24.661 --> 28:27.288
I'm looking for an Officer Hill or Renko.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.416
-Yeah, right here.
-Hi, I'm Officer Hill.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.167
-Denise Thompson.
-This way.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.921
Is there someplace I can interview
the woman privately?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.381
Uh, no, I'm afraid not.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.091
-The interrogation--
-Never mind.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.805
This is my partner, Officer Renko.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.808
-This is…
-Shirret Anders.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.726
Yes, ma'am.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.769
I'm filling in
for your old welfare worker.

28:49.853 --> 28:53.189
She retired rather suddenly,
and I'm still waiting for her files.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.820
Do you know who the father or fathers
of the children are?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.572
Uh-uh.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.949
-How old are the children?
-(sighs)

29:03.032 --> 29:05.827
Christopher is five, and April is three.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.662
-How old are you?
-Twenty.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.166
-I take it you're still receiving A.D.C.?
-Yes, ma'am.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.710
Officer Hill,
have you done your paperwork?

29:14.252 --> 29:16.379
-Uh, no.
-Why don't you? I'm running late.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.758
Wait a minute. We're talking about
a charge of child endangering here.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.386
That's pretty heavy stuff.
Why can't we be a little more creative?

29:23.470 --> 29:25.221
In what way did you have in mind, Officer?

29:25.305 --> 29:28.016
The point is, if you can open up a file,
just give her a warning,

29:28.099 --> 29:29.768
maybe we can help the situation.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.979
Officer, I already have a caseload
I can't adequately service.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.484
Conditions which provoked the situation
will, in all probability, not change,

29:37.567 --> 29:40.570
and my own personal experience
tells me that Miss Anders here

29:40.653 --> 29:42.989
doesn't yet have what it takes
to adequately provide

29:43.072 --> 29:44.866
for her children's well-being.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.035
Lady, I love my kids,

29:47.118 --> 29:49.245
but I just got to get out
sometime, you know?

29:50.038 --> 29:52.624
What happens to these kids
if I charge her?

29:52.707 --> 29:54.542
-They become wards of the court.
-Exactly!

29:54.626 --> 29:57.170
They're either dumped
into some overcrowded institution

29:57.253 --> 29:58.671
or farmed out to some foster home.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.965
You're making this very difficult,
Officer Hill.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.091
You're damn right I am.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.761
There are three people involved here.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.473
Why don't you give the lady a chance?

30:09.098 --> 30:11.643
I think that she can turn
this whole thing around.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.936
You do, do you?

30:13.978 --> 30:15.021
You're so sure of that?

30:15.730 --> 30:18.024
Well, not as sure as you are
that she won't,

30:19.359 --> 30:21.277
but sure enough to bet a dinner on it.

30:23.571 --> 30:27.200
You think Officer Hill's right? You think
you can get your act together, Shirret?

30:27.283 --> 30:28.535
Yes, ma'am.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.869
I love my babies.

30:29.953 --> 30:30.787
I will.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.542
I won't make you an official case,

30:36.084 --> 30:39.045
if Officer Hill is willing to share
the responsibility

30:39.128 --> 30:41.756
and periodically look in on you
to see how it's going.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.633
-All right?
-All right.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.468
Come on, girl. I'll ride you home.

30:55.812 --> 30:59.691
"Sure enough to bet a dinner on it."
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.609
She didn't say one word, did she?

31:01.693 --> 31:02.944
Talk about ice water.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.614
It doesn't matter. I wasn't hitting on her
anyway, Renko, so cool it.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.408
Yeah, she cooled you. I saw you

31:08.491 --> 31:11.661
looking at her
with those big, brown eyes of yours.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.121
Oh!

31:14.497 --> 31:16.666
Yeah, she was something to look at.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.794
She sure was, buddy,
but all you're gonna get to do is look.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.256
No big deal.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.727
(phone buzzing)

31:39.397 --> 31:40.273
MAN: Yeah?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.776
Yeah. Weeks.

31:44.777 --> 31:48.865
Face forward. Look straight ahead.
Number two, take your hat off.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.246
Look 'em over good, kid. I wanna know
which one of 'em sold it to you.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.166
Weeks.

31:58.249 --> 32:02.253
Just got a call from Fuchs at Midtown.
They turned your case.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.633
Just a couple of amateurs going
into business for themselves.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.968
They didn't even know
what the hell they were cutting.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.262
So, it's over and out, Weeks.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.723
What say we charge the driver kid
with possession

32:13.806 --> 32:15.391
and get on to some new business?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.445
Recognize any of 'em, sweetheart?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.907
-Uh, I don't know.
-Try harder.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.451
I'm not sure. Could you let go of my hair?

32:33.534 --> 32:34.786
Come on.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.913
Try a little harder, kid.
Help me on this one.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.165
Number four.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.920
-Four?
-Yeah, I think.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.255
-You sure?
-Yeah. (grunts)

32:46.339 --> 32:47.882
You lying little cockroach!

32:47.966 --> 32:49.467
Number four's one of my guys.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.094
Stand up. Stand up!

32:51.761 --> 32:53.304
-(grunts)
-Get up.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.265
I hate liars.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.435
You lying little scum.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.235
(woman on radio, indistinct)

33:10.989 --> 33:12.532
(indistinct chatter)

33:16.369 --> 33:18.079
Hey, you guys. Over.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.914
Yeah. Over.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.083
Uh, it's pretty slow here.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.668
We got two more stops,

33:23.751 --> 33:25.878
then we're coming back
the other way. Over.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.672
We got you covered, Fido. Over.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.883
How'd you like a collapsed lung,
kidney breath? Over.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.886
And out. Best in show, mixed breed.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.763
Why don't you lighten up on the dude, huh?

33:40.977 --> 33:42.895
WASHINGTON:
Hey, pull into that gas station.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.647
I gotta make a pit stop. Will you, man?

33:48.151 --> 33:49.068
(tires screech)

33:49.152 --> 33:51.988
Be a couple of minutes.
Monitor the radio, okay?

33:52.071 --> 33:53.990
-No sweat. I got you covered.
-All right.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.410
(exhales)

34:07.920 --> 34:11.799
(woman speaking indistinctly over radio)

34:39.869 --> 34:42.163
MAN: Exit the rear of the bus, please.
Exit at the rear.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.539
WOMAN: I have to get off.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.834
-MAN 1: Coming through.
-MAN 2: Head to the back.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.256
-Look at me!
-(all screaming)

34:53.341 --> 34:54.383
Get down. Get down.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.428
It's happening. It's coming down.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.306
(on radio) <i>It's coming down now.</i>
<i>You guys there?</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:03.184
Give me that! Give me the watch.
Give me that wallet!

35:03.267 --> 35:06.229
-(shouts)
-Freeze, little hair bag!

35:07.772 --> 35:09.565
Do it, and we're both dead.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.903
Back out the door
before one of us gets reckless.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.618
(suspenseful music playing)

35:20.701 --> 35:23.663
(bus passengers whimpering)

35:29.669 --> 35:32.338
-Drop it!
-(screams)

35:32.421 --> 35:34.841
(action music playing)

35:37.051 --> 35:39.512
-(tires screech)
-(horn honking)

35:39.595 --> 35:42.014
MAN (in car): Stupid idiot!
You wanna get killed?

35:45.810 --> 35:47.854
Move it. Move!

36:04.579 --> 36:06.664
Move! Get out of there!

36:12.712 --> 36:15.256
-Get down! Get down!
-Hey! Watch out!

36:25.433 --> 36:26.434
(groans)

36:35.610 --> 36:36.736
Freeze it!

36:38.237 --> 36:39.947
-(shot)
-(glass shatters)

36:42.033 --> 36:43.951
(shots)

36:44.035 --> 36:45.244
(glass shatters)

36:48.289 --> 36:50.124
(panting)

37:00.426 --> 37:02.303
(siren wailing)

37:04.138 --> 37:06.766
(tires screeching)

37:07.767 --> 37:11.312
(indistinct conversation over radio)

37:11.395 --> 37:13.147
-Where were you?
-Huh?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.900
I radioed you! Where the hell were you?

37:16.442 --> 37:18.736
He could've killed me. He had a shotgun.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.696
He coulda killed those people on the bus.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.032
Easy, man. Easy, easy.
Okay. Now, take it easy.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.493
Don't you tell me
to take it easy, Washington,

37:25.576 --> 37:28.079
not with him standing there
stinking of booze!

37:28.162 --> 37:29.538
And where the hell were you?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.290
Pit stop, babe. Sorry.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.708
Both of you?

37:32.792 --> 37:34.669
It takes both of you to go to the can?

37:34.752 --> 37:37.421
I just ran in for some cigarettes, Mick.
I'm sorry.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.132
You're full of crap, LaRue!

37:40.216 --> 37:41.676
You're a drunk.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.595
I won't have no drunk coverin' my back.

37:44.679 --> 37:45.888
(growls)

37:45.972 --> 37:47.306
Oh, man.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.599
(pants)

37:51.060 --> 37:52.979
Investigation team's on its way up.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.983
I'd ditch that pint
and do something about my breath.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.652
Yeah. Hey, look, uh,

37:59.735 --> 38:01.779
maybe you'd better talk
to Belker or something.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.991
He's liable to, you know, say something
to that investigating team.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.119
This is the last time, J.D.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.538
I mean that, man. The last time.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.001
Now, you do something about that problem,
or you've lost me.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.837
It won't happen again, man.
You got my word. Okay?

38:27.763 --> 38:30.182
(bell ringing)

38:36.063 --> 38:38.774
Okay, I'll see you next week. Bye-bye.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.032
Uh, Miss Pauley.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.950
Excuse me.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.202
-Yeah.
-Andy Renko from, uh--

38:50.286 --> 38:51.912
-Yeah.
-Anyway, I wanted to ask you

38:51.996 --> 38:53.456
about our essay that's due.

38:53.539 --> 38:56.500
Now, you say you want it written
in the third person,

38:56.584 --> 38:58.836
but you want it written
about something we know about.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.547
So, wouldn't it be better
if I did it from the "I" point of view?

39:02.214 --> 39:03.549
Well, this is practice.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.010
You see, this way it gives you
an opportunity

39:06.093 --> 39:07.720
to experiment with the language.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.263
-Experiment?
-Yeah.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.849
-Good. Okay.
-Okay? See you next week.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.226
-Yeah, good night.
-Good night.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.313
Miss Pauley, I'd feel a lot better
if I could walk you to the parking lot.

39:17.396 --> 39:20.232
This isn't the best of neighborhoods.
There's creeps around here.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.484
There's some people here

39:21.567 --> 39:24.528
that'd steal the smell off a junkie,
if you know what I mean, uh…?

39:24.612 --> 39:26.197
-Subway.
-Subway.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.741
-Yeah. I don't have a car.
-No car? Well, that's worse.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.409
That's four blocks from here,

39:30.493 --> 39:33.829
and I'd just feel better
if I maybe gave you a ride or something.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.750
-What are you driving, a spaceship?
-Ah, no, ma'am.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.585
You'd be riding on the back

39:39.668 --> 39:43.756
of a 1957 Harley-Davidson Hydro Glide hog.

39:43.839 --> 39:46.217
That's the original,
mind you, not a chopper.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.970
I have a 1,250cc. panhead
and a suicide clutch.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.681
Of course, uh,
being as you're wearing a skirt,

39:52.765 --> 39:54.433
maybe I ought to walk you home,

39:54.517 --> 39:57.269
unless you like to ride sidesaddle.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.357
If you don't mind my asking, Mr. Renko--

40:02.108 --> 40:03.609
Why is it that you come on to everyone

40:03.692 --> 40:06.570
like you just spent the afternoon
shoveling horse manure?

40:08.364 --> 40:09.990
Evening, ma'am.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.369
Mr. Renko.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.287
Mr. Renko.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.790
Yeah.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.210
Look, I've read some
of what you've written.

40:21.293 --> 40:24.422
You've got some fine ideas
and some fine perceptions,

40:24.505 --> 40:27.133
but I'll tell you, no one in this class
seems able to get past

40:27.216 --> 40:30.469
that continual line of macho garbage.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.931
Which is to say, yes,
I do mind riding sidesaddle.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.933
I mind the innuendo.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.563
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.566
It's just that I don't think a woman
as fine-looking as you

40:43.649 --> 40:47.069
should be all alone walking around in the
middle of the night, not around here.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.280
I'm a policeman, you know?

40:50.489 --> 40:51.532
Yeah, I know.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.038
Well, like you said,

40:59.165 --> 41:00.791
it is a four-block walk.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.544
Lots of creeps out there.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.465
-Besides me, right?
-Yeah.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.428
You, uh--You know
anything about motorcycles?

41:12.887 --> 41:13.929
Hmm… Not really.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.016
I bought this motorcycle
from this old boy down in Oklahoma.

41:17.099 --> 41:20.019
He had it shipped up here
on a flatbed truck, so I kind of…

41:20.102 --> 41:21.604
(romantic music playing)

41:24.815 --> 41:27.151
(indistinct shouting)

41:28.903 --> 41:31.363
(downbeat music)

41:44.752 --> 41:46.212
Thanks, Frank.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.846
What's the next step?

41:55.930 --> 41:57.765
Well, they're still running blood tests.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.604
They're gonna run what they call a…
a myelogram tomorrow morning,

42:03.687 --> 42:06.148
see if there's any problem
with his nervous system--

42:06.232 --> 42:08.400
blockage or something from a fall.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.361
How's Rachel holding up?

42:10.986 --> 42:11.820
Good.

42:12.821 --> 42:16.033
She, uh… She'll wait till something
happens one way or the other,

42:16.116 --> 42:17.451
and then fall apart like me.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.578
Don't knock it. It's a good trait.

42:21.747 --> 42:24.291
Why don't you take a couple of days,
see this thing through?

42:24.375 --> 42:25.543
Yeah, Rachel'd love that.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.878
Me down at the hospital
with her, making her nuts.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.005
Nah, I'm better off up here.

42:31.423 --> 42:32.591
Besides…

42:35.886 --> 42:38.180
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about myself, Frank.

42:40.474 --> 42:42.059
About my life, about this job.

42:45.521 --> 42:46.772
I'm no cop, Frank.

42:48.607 --> 42:50.359
The masquerade's gone on long enough.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.195
You've had a hard couple of days, Henry.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.488
It's not that.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.408
It's not just since Josh.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.332
It hasn't gotten any better
out there, Frank,

43:06.834 --> 43:08.210
not in my 12 years.

43:08.294 --> 43:09.461
Hell, it's worse than ever.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.256
We can't even make a dent in it,
and I'm not built like that.

43:13.299 --> 43:16.176
I can't live day-to-day
with that hopeless sewer out there

43:16.260 --> 43:17.595
just getting worse and worse.

43:26.061 --> 43:28.522
I'm not ashamed to say
they can take it and I can't.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.442
-They're tougher than I am.
-I doubt that, Henry.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.910
I wanna take my wife and my babies
and get the hell out of here,

43:43.203 --> 43:47.750
where I don't have to worry about
the violence and dope and race riots…

43:48.667 --> 43:51.170
and my children getting raped
coming home from school.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.425
Sorry.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.928
It's all right.
I worry about mine the same way.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.890
You know, mostly I wanna…

44:04.850 --> 44:06.143
take 'em somewhere where…

44:06.810 --> 44:09.938
(laughing): I can tell the good guys
from the bad guys.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.526
'Cause we don't have that luxury anymore.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.487
Not in this department we don't.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.322
That's not true, Henry.

44:19.698 --> 44:20.616
Hmm.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.204
Not completely.

44:26.163 --> 44:29.208
Most of us are still the good guys,
and most of us are still trying.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.335
It's hard.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.837
We're imperfect.

44:34.963 --> 44:37.633
The system sometimes makes
terrible mistakes, as it did today.

44:37.716 --> 44:39.885
-Come on. Don't do this.
-It's a big, cumbersome,

44:39.968 --> 44:41.095
imperfect system, Henry.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.305
And if you leave it,
it'll be just a little bit worse

44:44.056 --> 44:45.057
because you're good.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.686
I like to think I am, too.

44:51.105 --> 44:54.441
So, before you put through a resignation,
think about it, would you?

44:55.901 --> 44:58.445
(sad music playing)

45:25.389 --> 45:28.058
(theme music playing)

45:40.320 --> 45:42.030
(suspenseful music playing)

45:42.114 --> 45:45.033
(siren wailing)

46:25.616 --> 46:26.992
(car doors closing)

46:51.266 --> 46:53.060
Hey, I don't want
to be here all night, man.

46:53.143 --> 46:55.020
MAN 2:
I'm taking care of business, ain't I?

47:03.529 --> 47:05.155
Police officer! Hold it right there.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.491
-Hey, cops, man.
-Freeze!

47:07.574 --> 47:08.826
-(shots)
-Get down!

47:08.909 --> 47:10.118
-(man groans)
-(gunshots)

47:11.078 --> 47:13.038
-(shots)
-Curtis!

47:13.121 --> 47:15.165
Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on!

47:15.249 --> 47:17.543
-(shots continue)
-(tires screeching)

47:20.504 --> 47:23.382
(tires screeching)

47:24.508 --> 47:26.009
Police officer! Open up!

47:27.219 --> 47:29.680
(banging) Police! Open up!

47:35.018 --> 47:37.354
(panting)

47:39.857 --> 47:40.983
(sighs)

47:45.445 --> 47:47.614
(theme music plays)
