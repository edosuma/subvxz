WEBVTT

01:39.892 --> 01:41.852
Stop. Stop.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.395
Gary, what the fuck?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.314
Court order for asset seizure.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.982
Pay your property taxes, Maddie.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.027
No, this is a mistake.
I'm negotiating a payment schedule.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.987
Guess they're done negotiating.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.698
So they take my car? I'm an Uber driver.

01:54.698 --> 01:55.782
Not my problem.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.035
How am I supposed
to pay their taxes bartending?

01:58.035 --> 02:01.038
My problem is that
you went radio silent on me.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.831
Is that what this is about?

02:02.831 --> 02:06.084
No, I also have a contract
with the county,

02:06.084 --> 02:07.085
but I'm saying,

02:07.085 --> 02:09.670
a little explanation about why
I never heard from you again

02:09.670 --> 02:11.048
would've been nice.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.217
You can't just ghost people.
Three months is not nothing.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.845
Three months? Felt longer. In a good way.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.306
Wait, Gary, please stop.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.682
You were right, okay?

02:20.682 --> 02:23.602
My feelings were so intense
that I got scared.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.312
I freaked out.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.148
Is that true?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.442
Of course it's true, you big dummy.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.946
Last night, I was doing laundry,
and I thought to myself:

02:35.239 --> 02:40.160
"I miss that fucker. I miss hearing
about what the Jets were doing wrong."

02:40.744 --> 02:43.038
What you would do differently
if you ran the team.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.332
- They'd be so much better.
- So much better.

02:46.250 --> 02:50.212
The other day, I saw a green sock,
and I was like, that's Gary's.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.341
This feels good.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.553
Just say my car wasn't here, okay?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.139
Yeah. You know what?

03:01.139 --> 03:04.309
I will do that
because it's not gonna be here.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.480
What...? That's my cousin.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.024
He's from Italy.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.152
Gary, I swear to God, he's my cousin.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.572
Second cousin. That's their culture.

03:16.572 --> 03:20.367
- Have you ever been to Italy?
- I wanted closure, I got closure.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.702
- Thank you.
- Gary, come on.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.705
- It was a fling.
- No, no, it wasn't, not to me.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.790
My sister was right about you.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.752
Wait, your sister who was arrested
for elder abuse?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.087
Okay, Gary.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.673
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.759
You think you're so perfect?

03:37.759 --> 03:40.095
You're indecisive, which is annoying.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.057
Okay, Gary, I'm sorry.
Will you drop me off?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.185
I'm bartending at the Claw today.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.519
God. You know...

03:48.896 --> 03:50.480
I just can't decide.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.732
You're an asshole.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.005
You think I chose this?

04:31.230 --> 04:32.731
Hi, Gary. What can I get you?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.399
Let me get a banana bread.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.527
Actually. Wait, hold on.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.530
I gotta go lemon loaf.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.454
I'm gonna...

04:49.122 --> 04:50.207
I want a heated...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.547
- That's gonna be 4.50.
- Right.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.103
Come on.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.234
Hey.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.611
What the hell are you doing?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.446
Trying to save my house!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.873
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.211
No. No, no, no.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.634
Come on, man.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.401
Gotta get it together, Maddie.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.653
One more infraction
and you lose your licence.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.406
Lot of good a licence is gonna do me
when I don't have a car.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.366
My mom left me that house.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.535
It's paid off. Can they do this?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.704
If you haven't paid your taxes, they can.

06:10.704 --> 06:15.334
So these rich fucks move in
and then our taxes triple? Bullshit.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.753
Good news is
you have till September 1st.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.882
- You'll pay it off.
- Not without a car, man.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.220
Any idea how much money I lose
every day I'm not Ubering?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.347
Summer's when I make my nut for the year.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.306
I get it.

06:29.306 --> 06:33.352
These people are moving in,
trying to push me out?

06:33.352 --> 06:35.145
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.526
Course you do. Thanks.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.320
- See you on the water.
- All right.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.540
Come on, dawg. You know how we do.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.125
New house is right on the water.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.586
Tore down the old place. Gotta come out.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.921
G and T with lime.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.966
Yeah, I take him out on the boat,
like, every day.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.134
We're not open until noon.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.137
Know what, bro?
Let me call you right back.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.140
It is noon.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.143
It's 11:57.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.355
Got it.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.358
Now what time is it?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.154
It's 11:56.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.786
- Give it back.
- Why not wait on your boat?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.997
I'll blow the foghorn when we're open.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.832
The fuck's wrong? Just asked for a drink.

07:36.832 --> 07:40.627
Hey, hey, hey. Stop that.
What is going on here?

07:41.336 --> 07:44.131
Sir, I will make your drink for you.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.382
Good Lord.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.801
Fuck that. You need to fire her.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.887
I can't. She has a disability.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.054
What? No, I don't.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.431
- You don't?
- No.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.350
- That's the reason why I hired you.
- Bullshit.

07:55.350 --> 08:00.189
You know what? We cannot start off
the summer like this, okay?

08:00.189 --> 08:03.025
You could be a bitch
any other month of the year.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.694
Be a bitch in October.
Be a bitch in March.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.613
Don't be a bitch in June. Okay?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.239
These people keep our lights on.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.201
These people are the reason
I'm losing my house.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.703
Sorry, Fern.
I'm having a shitty morning.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.829
Yeah, I see that.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.457
You know what helps me?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.210
Folding napkins.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.297
Oh, this car's only $1000.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.091
Oh, no, that's just the tyres.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.345
Not gonna find anything on Craigslist.
I've looked.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.472
You could always sell your kidney.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.477
You could sell your hair,
your plasma, your eggs.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.104
The human body's a cash cow.
People don't understand that.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
Jim, I can feel our baby getting dumber.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.275
Just trying to help.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.944
You could always rent the house out.

08:46.944 --> 08:50.239
No. I can't stand the thought
of those summer people

08:50.239 --> 08:51.532
being in my house.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.408
Hey, hey. Look at this.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.329
"Need a car for college?

08:57.329 --> 08:59.665
Date our 19-year-old son this summer.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.418
He's a wonderful young man,
extremely smart, but socially shy.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.504
Never had a girlfriend.
We've tried everything.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.298
We're looking for an attractive,
kind, intelligent woman,

09:08.298 --> 09:09.800
early to mid-20s,

09:09.800 --> 09:13.929
to date him and bring him out of his shell
before he leaves for college in the fall.

09:13.929 --> 09:18.016
In exchange, we'll give you a Buick Regal,
clean, rust-free, 40K miles.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.309
Serious enquiries only."

09:19.977 --> 09:21.186
"Date" is in quotes.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.273
- It's gotta be a joke, right?
- No.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.150
Have you seen
these helicopter parents?

09:27.150 --> 09:28.819
They'll do everything for their kids.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.238
Surprised they're not gonna
fuck him themselves.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.323
It does say early to mid-20s, though.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.285
- That's okay. I can pass for that.
- Okay.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.287
You won't rent your house out,

09:38.287 --> 09:40.372
but now you'll rent out your vag?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.416
The adults are talking.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.043
Just 'cause I'm a guy,
I can't express an opinion?

09:45.043 --> 09:46.962
- Exactly. Yeah, shut up.
- Yeah.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.423
You have a Road Runner tattoo
covering your entire back.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.176
Don't think you should tell anybody
what to do with their body.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.094
What about an OnlyFans page?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.055
What's an OnlyFans page, Jim?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.100
That would take too long.
I need a car now.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.853
Just surprised you're considering this.
That's all.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.856
I've had a one-night stand before
and gotten zero Buick Regals for it.

10:05.856 --> 10:09.693
Babe, you don't know this, but women have
all sorts of reasons for having sex.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.695
I had sex once because I didn't want
to commute in the morning.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.240
I've had sex once
to get out of playing Settlers of Catan.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.284
I had sex once on a first date

10:17.284 --> 10:19.620
- 'cause I thought he was gonna kill me.
- Jesus.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.873
- You're with me now, babe.
- She's talking about you, dumbass.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.128
Yeah! Epic!

10:28.837 --> 10:31.173
Waves are firing. No tourists.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.801
- You guys are missing out.
- It's probably not even real.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.387
It would be the fastest way to get a car.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.725
Oh, yeah. Kid would cream his shorts
as soon as he saw you.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.853
- Then you can just drive right home.
- Oh, my God.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.356
- Jim.
- You want my opinion?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.984
These people use us.
So why don't we use them?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.613
I just know my mom would've wanted me
to save that house.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.824
Yeah. Things are so expensive now.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.619
Think I wanna wait tables
after teaching kids all year?

11:00.619 --> 11:01.662
Listen to me.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.914
If you're really in a pinch,
you can use our van.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.041
I'll send Sara to fuck the kid instead.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.751
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Jim.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.711
Just trying to keep it light.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.506
Think a kid wants to have sex with you
in your current condition?

11:13.257 --> 11:15.467
- Get back into the sea.
- Just opened a beer.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.386
Go to the sea.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.639
- It's cold as fuck--
- Go in the ocean.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.224
Might just keep paddling.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.327
Maddie.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.329
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.247
Hey.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.583
- Any trouble finding the place?
- No.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.252
No. Found it.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.338
Oh, well, welcome to our home.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.216
I'm Allison and this is my husband, Laird.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.760
Layered? Like lasagna?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.096
Lasagna? No. Laird.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.557
Laird. Am I saying that right?

13:26.557 --> 13:28.684
Yeah, one syllable. Laird.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.685
Okay.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.063
- Just call me Laird.
- I can't.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.858
So should I come up,
or do you wanna come down here?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.776
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on up.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.236
- That'd be great.
- Come on up.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.084
I just want you to know,

13:54.084 --> 13:57.004
we have the utmost respect
for sex workers.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.839
I am...

13:58.839 --> 14:00.424
not a sex worker.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.968
- Not that there's anything wrong.
- Oh, no.

14:03.844 --> 14:08.432
So, Maddie, tell us about yourself.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.559
- Where you from?
- Here, actually.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.019
Wow, a local.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.312
I'm jealous.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.606
You live in paradise all year long.

14:15.606 --> 14:18.901
I meant to ask this on the phone,
but how old are you?

14:18.901 --> 14:19.818
Well...

14:20.402 --> 14:25.991
I know you were looking for someone
early to mid-20s.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.452
- I'm slightly older.
- Right. How old?

14:29.286 --> 14:30.329
I just turned 29.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.788
- Recently?
- Last year.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.540
- So you're 29?
- Last year.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.335
And how old are you, like, right now?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.295
- One more year older.
- So 30.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.214
Yeah. 32.

14:42.007 --> 14:42.841
I...

14:43.592 --> 14:44.718
May I be frank?

14:46.637 --> 14:49.765
I'm assuming that I'm here
because you haven't found anyone yet,

14:49.765 --> 14:51.850
and the reason
you haven't found anyone yet

14:51.850 --> 14:54.978
is because young girls are idiots.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.855
That's not their fault. They're young.

14:56.855 --> 14:57.940
But...

14:57.940 --> 15:00.526
this is your son we're talking about.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.947
What you need is someone
who looks like a peer,

15:04.947 --> 15:07.783
but has the maturity
to be able to handle this

15:07.783 --> 15:11.495
with the tact and sensitivity
the situation requires.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.830
- She's good.
- Good.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.998
Good answer.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.877
We've just been so worried about our son.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.549
Percy is so loving,
and he is so sensitive,

15:23.549 --> 15:25.634
and he's extremely bright.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.761
He's going to Princeton next year.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.179
Oh, I've heard of it.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.473
He's an amazing musician,
but won't play for anyone.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.309
He's just having
a lot of trouble socially.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.644
You know, and as a mother,

15:35.644 --> 15:38.564
that's just been really hard to watch
these past four years.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.900
Always on his phone,
doesn't come out of his room,

15:41.900 --> 15:45.362
he doesn't have any friends,
he doesn't talk to girls.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.116
Doesn't drink, doesn't go to parties,
doesn't drive.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.784
Doesn't do anything that I did.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.996
We can't send him to college like that.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.247
He'd never make it.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.875
Well, that's why
you called a professional.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.461
Not a professional,
just a girl who needs a car.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.132
Yeah. We didn't come by this easily.

16:05.883 --> 16:08.343
We tried everything
to bring him out of his shell.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.431
- We're at the end of our rope.
- I was shy when I was Percy's age.

16:12.431 --> 16:15.350
But I dated this girl
before I went to college,

16:15.350 --> 16:17.728
and she really opened me up sexually.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.104
- Okay.
- Barbara.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.274
Anyway, by the time I got to college,

16:22.274 --> 16:25.027
I was out of my shell and thriving.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.322
- Yes, and that's what we want for Percy.
- Is this him?

16:28.322 --> 16:29.239
Yes.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.661
- Wow, he's adorable.
- Isn't he?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.414
So...

16:38.498 --> 16:39.499
how does this work?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.169
The honour system or...?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.421
That, and we know his passcode.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.049
And he's not gay?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.301
No. We've seen his Internet history.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.929
Yeah, the porn is graphic, but not gay.

16:51.929 --> 16:55.265
A little gay. Large groups of people.

16:56.642 --> 17:00.938
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,
but does it have to be a Buick?

17:01.855 --> 17:03.065
It's just what Dad drove.

17:03.982 --> 17:07.694
Okay, then, why don't you date Percy
and the Buick is yours?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.571
And don't just "date" him, you know?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.366
Get to know him, 'cause he's a good kid.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.785
So when you say date him,

17:14.785 --> 17:18.079
do you mean date him or date him?

17:18.789 --> 17:20.624
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's correct.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.001
- Date him.
- Date him hard.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.086
Okay.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.213
I'll date his brains out.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.715
So is he in his room?
Should I jump out and surprise him?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.634
No. No, no, no. He's not here.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.928
He can't know about this.
Nobody can know about this.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.764
Nobody can know about this.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.851
Also, it would devastate him,
which would defeat the purpose

17:38.851 --> 17:40.727
of building up his confidence.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.229
Right. Right.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.190
He volunteers at the animal shelter
from 10 to 6.

17:45.190 --> 17:49.111
We thought maybe you could go
and act like you wanna adopt a dog.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.821
And I don't see this happening,

17:50.821 --> 17:55.117
but if Percy dates somebody
the organic way...

17:55.117 --> 17:57.494
- Got it. Better get to work.
- Yeah.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.343
I'm drifting.
I'm drifting, I'm drifting, I'm drifting.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.219
Hi. Can I interest you
in some unconditional love?

18:55.219 --> 18:58.347
- Looking for something to slobber on you?
- Can he help me?

18:59.306 --> 19:02.768
Well, he works with the dogs.
I deal with the people.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.312
But you have a weird energy.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.314
Don't worry, I've been neutered.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.982
I want him.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.528
Percy, can you help this lady?

19:17.449 --> 19:18.784
Mind if I touch your wiener?

19:19.493 --> 19:21.453
- What?
- Your dog.

19:23.622 --> 19:24.623
Yeah.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.001
How can I help you?

19:28.001 --> 19:29.753
I wanna adopt a dog.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.338
Oh, yeah. Sure.

19:34.508 --> 19:35.342
Great.

19:38.971 --> 19:41.056
- That's a cool cartoon.
- It's anime.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.392
Yeah, animated. That's what I said.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.353
Excuse me. I need your help.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.146
Sorry, sorry. Okay.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.940
What kind of dog are you looking to adopt?

19:49.940 --> 19:52.067
I wish I could adopt them all.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.861
Which is the most fucked up?

19:55.737 --> 19:58.115
The most messed up is Milo.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.199
This is Milo.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.660
He's been here the longest.

20:03.996 --> 20:07.457
He was a drug dog for the state police,
but they forced him into retirement

20:07.457 --> 20:10.669
because he got addicted to C-O-C-A-I-N-E.

20:10.669 --> 20:11.753
Cocaine?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.630
No! Milo!

20:13.630 --> 20:14.882
Milo. Milo.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.093
If he hears the word, he gets triggered.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.053
Sorry, Milo. I'm fresh out.

20:21.555 --> 20:22.931
It's okay. It's okay.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.142
I have to ask you questions

20:25.142 --> 20:27.519
just to make sure
you're a suitable candidate.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.314
We do it with everyone. It's the rules.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.274
A little rule follower, huh?

20:32.274 --> 20:34.568
Yeah, they're super important.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.571
So is there, like,
an office or somewhere private?

20:38.989 --> 20:40.032
An office.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.825
- Come right this way.
- Great.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.204
Maddie Barker.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.290
I feel so far from you.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.735
Spouse?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.905
Currently single.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.114
Thank God too.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.742
You can just have more fun.
Be spontaneous.

21:23.742 --> 21:24.993
"Unmarried."

21:25.827 --> 21:26.662
Children?

21:27.329 --> 21:29.373
No. God, no. Too young.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.875
Having fun still. Meeting new people.
I love that.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.086
"Childless."

21:36.547 --> 21:38.006
Why do you want to adopt a dog?

21:38.006 --> 21:40.300
Because I can't have dogs of my own.

21:44.972 --> 21:47.599
And what do you plan to do
with the dog if you move?

21:47.599 --> 21:48.892
I'm not moving.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.477
Well, if you did.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.813
I have lived here my whole life.
Not going anywhere.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.982
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.692
No. Pry.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.069
Pry me open.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.580
Oh, what? Already?

22:10.581 --> 22:11.790
Okay. Sorry.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.042
I'll have to send this application
up to my supervisor.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.378
Come on. Gotta be more questions.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.673
Yes, there are,
but I have to start closing up.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.967
So yeah. You can come back
another day, though.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.720
I might not want a dog another day.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.514
I want a dog right now.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.309
Well, then,
pet ownership may not be for you.

22:30.309 --> 22:36.481
You sound a lot like the kind of person
we would normally take a dog from.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.443
How about I give you a ride home?

22:39.443 --> 22:41.028
And we can keep talking?

22:41.028 --> 22:44.156
- You're on the way.
- How do you know where I live?

22:44.740 --> 22:46.200
Your parents told me.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.036
- What?
- It's on your school bag.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.710
Everything under control?

22:56.710 --> 23:00.464
Hey, Crispin, what's the company policy
about leaving early?

23:00.464 --> 23:03.008
It's like we super can't do that, right?

23:03.008 --> 23:05.260
Would that be, you know, frowned upon?

23:05.260 --> 23:07.387
Oh, come on. Let's go.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.305
Okay.

23:08.931 --> 23:09.973
Okay.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.725
You can finish alone, right?

23:11.725 --> 23:13.435
Bet you do it all the time.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.353
Thanks.

23:15.062 --> 23:15.896
Bye.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.106
Okay, then.

23:18.941 --> 23:19.775
Approved.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.032
- That's your car?
- It is for tonight.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.827
Actually, you know what?

23:30.827 --> 23:33.830
This sucks, but I just remembered
I rode my bike here, so...

23:34.498 --> 23:36.959
This is what-- I'll go on this.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.126
Well, that's okay.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.464
I can just throw it in the back.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.675
You can ride up front with me.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.056
Oh, come on. I won't bite.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.643
Unless you want me to.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.524
Okay. But no biting.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.155
I mean, whatever.
I've been with girls a couple times.

24:07.698 --> 24:10.534
- Where's the rest of my seat belt?
- It's a lap belt.

24:10.534 --> 24:13.704
Pretend you're on an airplane.
I'll be your flight attendant.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.582
Why is the flight attendant
flying the plane?

24:16.582 --> 24:18.750
I've killed the pilot
and taken over the plane.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.043
You're my hostage.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.600
- This isn't the way to my house.
- It's a shortcut.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.826
Give me that. What are you doing?

24:52.826 --> 24:55.078
Our generation and our phones, huh?

24:58.624 --> 24:59.833
We're home.

25:01.793 --> 25:02.836
Okay.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.135
What you got down there? Something for me?

25:14.264 --> 25:15.766
Oh, fuck!

25:28.362 --> 25:29.363
Why?

25:29.363 --> 25:30.864
You tried kidnapping me!

25:30.864 --> 25:33.951
I can't kidnap you. You're 19. Grow up.

25:33.951 --> 25:36.370
You put me in a van and took my phone.

25:36.370 --> 25:40.666
If I were kidnapping you, would I give
my personal information first?

25:40.666 --> 25:43.544
Why couldn't you have used
your rape whistle?

25:43.544 --> 25:45.087
Why would I have a rape whistle?

25:45.087 --> 25:47.130
Why do you have fucking Mace?

25:47.965 --> 25:48.799
Sorry.

25:49.508 --> 25:52.386
Will you get the hose, please? Please.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.017
- It's broken.
- Is the water on?

25:59.017 --> 26:01.937
- You have to turn the water on?
- Are you fucking with me?

26:01.937 --> 26:04.273
- Maybe it was already on.
- The spigot.

26:04.273 --> 26:05.732
- The spigot.
- Oh, okay.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.276
God.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.282
God. Fuck.

26:13.282 --> 26:14.992
- Stop spraying me with it.
- I'm sorry.

26:14.992 --> 26:16.660
I'm trying to help. I'm sorry.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.873
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:20.873 --> 26:21.957
I'm sorry.

26:22.791 --> 26:23.792
I'm sorry.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.044
I didn't know
what you were trying to do.

26:27.087 --> 26:29.840
- I just thought you were hot.
- You think I'm hot?

26:29.840 --> 26:33.051
Yeah. I think you're super hot.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.305
Maybe we should go on a date, then?

26:38.140 --> 26:39.474
I'll go throw another dress on.

26:39.474 --> 26:43.395
Oh, no, I didn't mean now.
I meant, you know, tomorrow. Like...

26:44.146 --> 26:44.980
a real date.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.483
Yeah, that's better.

26:49.109 --> 26:50.152
Okay.

26:50.152 --> 26:51.278
Tomorrow, then.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.577
Thank you for the ride.

27:01.079 --> 27:01.914
Bye.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.921
Can't believe
this kid is going to Princeton.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.088
He's dumb as shit.

27:10.088 --> 27:13.884
He's just afraid of the world.
They all are. Grew up in bubble wrap.

27:13.884 --> 27:18.138
My cousin, she's 20. Still lives at home.
Won't go outside without a helmet.

27:19.348 --> 27:20.557
It might be a medical thing.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.685
The problem is the parents. They baby him.

27:23.685 --> 27:26.730
Anyway, I'll need the van tonight
for my big date.

27:26.730 --> 27:27.940
- No.
- What?

27:27.940 --> 27:28.857
No.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.734
Gonna take me a week
to air that thing out.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.195
Sara's pregnant.
I can't have her breathing those fumes.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.781
Ask Fern to borrow that Claw car.

27:37.241 --> 27:38.742
That'll drop his panties.

27:42.913 --> 27:44.748
- Hey, Mel.
- Hi, Mel.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.041
Hey, guys.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.252
Did you hear about Mel?

27:48.252 --> 27:50.796
She got herself a sugar daddy.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.089
You could do that.

27:52.089 --> 27:55.217
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about a car or property taxes.

27:55.217 --> 27:59.137
No. No way I'm gonna be on call
to some rich asshole all summer.

27:59.137 --> 28:03.225
If you see me doing that,
it means I've compromised who I am,

28:03.225 --> 28:05.561
and you can kill me
because I've given up.

28:06.478 --> 28:09.690
I should have this Buick by now,
but this kid is unfuckable.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.947
Well, you look like an accountant
in the Bahamas.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.868
It was too hot for pants.

29:04.745 --> 29:07.039
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:07.623 --> 29:10.167
I'm so glad we're doing this.
A date was a great idea.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.793
Am I allowed to be here?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.504
Oh, yeah. I know the owner. It's fine.

29:13.504 --> 29:15.422
It's just that I'm not 21.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.924
That doesn't matter here.

29:16.924 --> 29:18.800
I think it's a federal law, but...

29:23.514 --> 29:25.557
Where is the waitress?

29:25.557 --> 29:28.101
I just hope my parents don't find out
that I'm here.

29:28.852 --> 29:29.853
Do they come here?

29:29.853 --> 29:31.647
No, no. They track my phone.

29:31.647 --> 29:34.608
Wow, okay. Do they microchip you too?

29:37.819 --> 29:39.238
There she is, the Flash.

29:39.238 --> 29:40.739
What do you want, Maddie?

29:41.323 --> 29:43.617
A Long Island iced tea for me, and...

29:43.617 --> 29:45.619
- Pepsi, please.
- We only have Coke.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.791
- Do you wanna go somewhere else?
- No, Percy.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.501
He'll have a Long Island iced tea too.

29:53.085 --> 29:54.086
Okay.

29:54.086 --> 29:55.003
Thank you.

29:58.924 --> 29:59.967
I'm really tense.

30:00.676 --> 30:02.094
Why? Is everything okay?

30:02.094 --> 30:07.140
Yeah, I just-- I had this really
intense dream about you last night.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.225
Don't ask.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.686
Of course. That's private.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.229
Do you ever have those?

30:12.229 --> 30:13.605
Intense dreams?

30:15.566 --> 30:17.359
Actually, yeah.

30:17.359 --> 30:18.527
Tell me.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.530
You know Harley Quinn from <i>Suicide Squad?</i>

30:22.447 --> 30:23.282
Okay.

30:23.282 --> 30:28.036
I had this one dream
where I wouldn't let her adopt a dog.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.415
So she'd locked me
in one of the dog cages

30:31.415 --> 30:33.375
and dragged me back to her hideout.

30:33.375 --> 30:36.461
I kicked at the cage and screamed.

30:36.461 --> 30:37.629
And that made you come?

30:38.839 --> 30:39.673
I did not.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.758
How is that a sex dream?

30:42.759 --> 30:44.553
You asked me if I have intense dreams.

30:46.054 --> 30:48.432
You're right.
I should've been more specific.

30:49.850 --> 30:52.686
I used to have nightmares about this song
when I was a kid.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.354
Why?

30:54.354 --> 30:57.608
'Cause it's about a monster.
A man-eater.

30:58.442 --> 31:02.738
"She only comes out at night.
Watch out, boy. She'll chew you up."

31:04.323 --> 31:06.283
I don't think
that's what the song is about.

31:06.283 --> 31:07.492
I'll look into that.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.537
Long Island iced tea
for America's sweetheart,

31:10.537 --> 31:11.747
and one for the boy.

31:11.747 --> 31:14.416
Oh, good news, by the way.

31:14.416 --> 31:15.792
We got some new dogs in today.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.753
So, you know, if you're still looking...

31:21.840 --> 31:23.759
This is the worst iced tea I've ever had.

31:23.759 --> 31:25.511
Percy, you're going to college soon.

31:25.511 --> 31:27.596
You're gonna have to learn how to drink.

31:27.596 --> 31:29.723
Can't go your whole life
scared of everything.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.642
I'm not scared of everything.

31:31.642 --> 31:33.185
Come on. Open up.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.436
Have your medicine.

31:34.436 --> 31:36.271
- Come on, baby bird.
- I don't like it.

31:36.271 --> 31:37.940
- Oh, shit.
- Well, well,

31:37.940 --> 31:40.192
look at what the tide dragged in.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.319
Hello, Travis.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.572
Well, I don't know if you heard, but...

31:47.366 --> 31:48.825
That's great. Congratulations.

31:48.825 --> 31:50.786
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.206
Turns out your little disappearing act,

31:54.206 --> 31:56.333
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.627
Well, I'm happy I could help.

31:58.627 --> 31:59.753
You know...

32:01.046 --> 32:05.467
my wife, she speaks three languages.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.970
She's hot as fuck. The sex is incredible.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.515
We do everything together. All of it.

32:11.515 --> 32:13.851
That's great.
Is her vagina dishwasher-safe?

32:13.851 --> 32:14.768
No.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.312
She's a real person.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.398
Unlike you.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.067
Wanna know what the best part is?

32:22.818 --> 32:24.528
When I told her that I loved her,

32:25.237 --> 32:28.323
she said it back to me
instead of running away.

32:28.991 --> 32:30.409
Like a coward.

32:30.409 --> 32:33.287
That must've been
a really exciting second date.

32:39.001 --> 32:40.794
You better be careful of this one.

32:42.588 --> 32:43.922
She is slippery.

32:43.922 --> 32:46.550
Bye-bye. Bye, Travis.

32:48.635 --> 32:51.180
- Is that your ex-boyfriend?
- More like a friend.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.016
It felt like you didn't really like him.

32:54.016 --> 32:57.811
- You met him. Do you like him?
- I didn't have sex with him.

32:57.811 --> 33:00.147
Do you want to? I can call him back over.

33:00.147 --> 33:02.274
- Hey, Travis.
- No, no, no. No.

33:02.983 --> 33:04.484
I don't wanna do that. I just...

33:04.484 --> 33:06.737
I don't know
why you'd have sex with someone

33:06.737 --> 33:07.946
if you don't like them.

33:07.946 --> 33:10.616
It was Christmas, I was lonely.
I don't know.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.409
Why'd you disappear on him?

33:12.409 --> 33:14.953
What's with the questions?
Can't we get drunk and have fun?

33:14.953 --> 33:17.581
Oh, sorry. Just trying to get to know you.

33:20.417 --> 33:23.003
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yes. Please.

33:24.171 --> 33:25.631
I think I'm a little drunk.

33:25.631 --> 33:27.799
Yeah, you've been drinking a lot.

33:28.550 --> 33:29.551
No, I wasn't.

33:30.511 --> 33:32.262
God, I love the beach.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.723
I just feel so free out here. Don't you?

33:36.016 --> 33:36.850
Yeah.

33:37.601 --> 33:41.063
I think it's closed, though.
Oh, it's after 8, so...

33:42.105 --> 33:44.858
We could come back during operating hours.

33:44.858 --> 33:48.320
- We got the whole place to ourselves.
- Lots of red flags.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.948
- Let's go swimming.
- There's no lifeguards.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.909
Perfect. We can go skinny-dipping.

33:55.202 --> 33:56.912
Oh, look, no swimming.

33:57.788 --> 33:59.122
Oh, we tried.

33:59.748 --> 34:03.418
You know, those rules are
more like just suggestions.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.380
Come on, let's get you
out of these Daisy Dukes.

34:07.297 --> 34:08.882
Maddie, I don't know.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.594
I'm ugly to you. I knew it.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.138
- I knew it.
- What?

34:16.764 --> 34:17.599
No.

34:19.309 --> 34:20.978
- No.
- Seems like it.

34:20.978 --> 34:21.895
No, I...

34:23.688 --> 34:25.107
I think you're the...

34:25.107 --> 34:27.275
I think you're the prettiest person
I've ever seen.

34:28.402 --> 34:29.235
Really?

34:30.279 --> 34:31.112
Pretty where?

34:37.077 --> 34:38.078
Pretty here?

34:41.290 --> 34:43.917
Or pretty here?

34:51.592 --> 34:52.801
What about sharks?

34:53.342 --> 34:54.344
None here.

34:55.679 --> 34:56.513
Jellyfish?

34:56.513 --> 34:57.848
Not in season.

34:57.848 --> 35:00.893
It's really the lack of lifeguards
that's causing an issue for me.

35:00.893 --> 35:04.271
- Just get the fuck in here right now!
- Okay! Okay. Okay.

35:05.105 --> 35:07.858
Come on.
I promise nothing's gonna happen.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.613
Isn't this how <i>Jaws</i> started?

35:17.075 --> 35:18.660
I'm going to trust you.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.426
See? It's not so bad.

35:40.098 --> 35:41.683
Fuck her!

35:41.683 --> 35:44.019
Fuck her in the butt!

35:44.019 --> 35:46.313
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

35:46.313 --> 35:47.397
Hello.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.400
Hey, what you up to over there?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.361
Just doing our taxes.

35:53.111 --> 35:54.488
These yours?

35:54.488 --> 35:56.532
Yeah, no need to fold them.

35:56.532 --> 35:58.534
Let's take her clothes. Take her clothes.

35:58.534 --> 36:01.161
- Take her fucking clothes.
- They're taking our clothes.

36:01.161 --> 36:04.915
- Hey, put that back!
- Suck my balls!

36:06.625 --> 36:07.918
I'm warning you.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.379
Bye, sea bitch.

36:10.379 --> 36:12.464
You said nothing bad would happen.

36:12.464 --> 36:15.551
- We need to find an adult.
- Percy, you're an adult.

36:15.551 --> 36:16.885
Where are you going?

36:18.220 --> 36:19.638
Oh, dude. What the fuck?

36:19.638 --> 36:21.223
- Gross, right?
- Dude.

36:21.223 --> 36:22.349
It's like nasty.

36:22.349 --> 36:24.643
- Wait, are you serious?
- We lost one.

36:25.185 --> 36:27.145
- Fuck yeah.
- Come here, cunts.

36:27.145 --> 36:28.605
What the fuck?

36:31.900 --> 36:33.151
Shit.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.903
- Stay the fuck back.
- Who wants some?

36:35.946 --> 36:37.281
Fucking...

36:38.282 --> 36:39.241
Come on.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.545
Come here. Come on. Come on.

36:52.337 --> 36:53.380
Oh, my God.

36:54.381 --> 36:56.133
- Connor.
- What the fuck?

36:57.426 --> 36:59.261
What about you?
You want the business?

36:59.261 --> 37:01.680
- Take it. Take it.
- Think it's cool to steal clothes?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.807
- You need fucking help.
- I'm calling the cops.

37:03.807 --> 37:06.476
And stay the fuck out of Montauk!

37:09.229 --> 37:10.314
Where were we?

37:10.981 --> 37:14.401
- What happened over there?
- I got our clothes back.

37:15.194 --> 37:17.988
- Did you beat up those kids?
- No.

37:17.988 --> 37:20.657
- They apologised.
- I heard screaming.

37:21.825 --> 37:23.493
That was the apologising.

37:27.497 --> 37:31.293
I don't like this.
Something's really wrong with you.

37:31.293 --> 37:35.130
They had our clothes, our phones,
our keys, our wallets.

37:35.130 --> 37:38.175
I got them back.
What would you have done? Nothing?

37:38.175 --> 37:40.719
- You should be thanking me.
- I was coming up with a plan.

37:40.719 --> 37:43.013
To do what? Call your mom and dad?

37:43.013 --> 37:44.056
Sack up, ho.

37:45.224 --> 37:48.268
Sorry. That was mean. Let's fuck.

37:49.895 --> 37:50.979
No?

37:53.232 --> 37:54.233
Why not?

37:54.775 --> 37:57.486
Because it's like you're trying to eat me.

37:57.486 --> 37:58.529
Oh, God.

37:58.529 --> 38:01.532
I'm not gonna have sex
with somebody that I don't know.

38:01.532 --> 38:04.368
It's better that way. Trust me.

38:04.368 --> 38:05.994
Not for me.

38:06.828 --> 38:10.332
This is bullshit. I'm done.
I feel sorry for you.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.343
Fucking waste of time.

38:21.343 --> 38:23.136
Hey! Hey!

38:25.556 --> 38:27.808
- Hey, give me my clothes.
- Okay.

38:28.642 --> 38:31.019
Here, take your little booty shorts.

38:33.397 --> 38:36.400
Where's my phone? Is it in your car?

38:36.400 --> 38:38.485
- Nope.
- You barely even looked.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.404
- It's not in here.
- Can you check?

38:40.404 --> 38:43.657
- My parents need to know where I am.
- Why? Are you a child?

38:49.913 --> 38:50.998
Give me my phone!

38:50.998 --> 38:53.876
- Percy, get off my hood.
- Not until you give me my phone.

38:53.876 --> 38:56.503
- I need it.
- Okay, guess we're doing this.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.675
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, very funny, Maddie.

39:01.675 --> 39:03.635
- Yo!
- Now let me off.

39:05.304 --> 39:07.139
Just give me my phone.
I just need my phone.

39:07.139 --> 39:10.893
- I will drive to fucking Chicago.
- Just give me my phone.

39:12.644 --> 39:15.480
Don't test me. 'Cause I'm fucking crazy.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.192
I'm stupid. I'm dumb. I don't give a--

39:18.192 --> 39:19.610
Fuck me.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.278
- Oh, thank God.
- Fuck.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.114
- Idiot.
- Oh, thank God.

39:24.114 --> 39:27.242
Okay, pull over.
Just pull over. Just stop.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.913
I'm on probation. I can't lose my licence.

39:30.913 --> 39:32.206
<i>Pull over.</i>

39:33.665 --> 39:35.667
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hang on.

39:36.710 --> 39:38.670
Sorry. Hold on.

39:38.670 --> 39:42.090
Oh, my God!

39:47.095 --> 39:48.305
God.

39:58.941 --> 40:01.610
I'm not seeing any cops out there.
I think we lost them.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.946
Are you sure? Keep looking.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.741
I can't believe
you drove over the train tracks.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.535
I thought we were gonna die.

40:09.535 --> 40:12.037
You were really brave,
holding on to the hood like that.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.956
Most guys would've fallen off.

40:13.956 --> 40:17.125
I have pretty strong hands
from piano lessons.

40:17.125 --> 40:19.169
We should have some music.

40:19.169 --> 40:20.629
Yeah, yeah.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.631
Hey, thank you for these clothes,
by the way.

40:24.299 --> 40:26.426
I like your house a lot. It's cosy.

40:26.426 --> 40:28.720
Bedroom's the best part.
I'll show you later.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.649
Oh, we're wearing the same shorts.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.866
Did you grow up dancing?

40:51.577 --> 40:52.661
Smack it.

40:52.661 --> 40:55.330
You want...? Me smack it?
You want me to smack it?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.668
- Do I have your consent...?
- Yeah.

40:59.668 --> 41:01.712
Smack it. Harder.

41:03.088 --> 41:03.922
Hit it.

41:05.424 --> 41:06.425
Sorry.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.930
So how long have you lived here?

41:24.318 --> 41:26.320
You're a little heavy on my legs.

41:27.196 --> 41:28.322
You wanna switch?

41:38.707 --> 41:40.042
Do you wanna go to the bedroom?

41:40.918 --> 41:41.919
We can take it slow.

41:42.878 --> 41:43.712
Yeah.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.048
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

41:46.632 --> 41:48.133
Yeah, I wanna-- I wanna--

41:48.133 --> 41:51.220
Yeah, I'm just a little itchy.
But let's go.

41:52.346 --> 41:53.180
Sorry.

41:53.764 --> 41:55.015
Does it look weird?

41:55.766 --> 41:58.393
- No, it's fine.
- My back itches too.

42:01.563 --> 42:03.398
- Oh, my God.
- What?

42:05.734 --> 42:07.069
Oh, God.

42:09.321 --> 42:11.281
This happens sometimes when I get anxious.

42:11.281 --> 42:13.617
I know you're really horny. I'm sorry.

42:14.618 --> 42:15.452
Fuck.

42:16.578 --> 42:19.540
This is for board rash,
but it should do the trick.

42:20.749 --> 42:22.167
I'm so embarrassed.

42:23.126 --> 42:24.253
Don't be.

42:25.921 --> 42:28.674
I once went to a Halloween party
dressed as a baby.

42:28.674 --> 42:31.593
My crush was there,
and as we were hooking up,

42:31.593 --> 42:34.638
we both realised
that I got diaper rash from my costume.

42:35.389 --> 42:36.723
I was 21.

42:36.723 --> 42:38.392
You didn't wear underwear?

42:39.059 --> 42:40.727
Diapers are underwear.

42:40.727 --> 42:43.564
No, they're not.
Diapers are like wearable toilets.

42:43.564 --> 42:44.982
Well, I didn't use it.

42:45.816 --> 42:46.692
Sure, you didn't.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.653
There's a smile.

42:52.531 --> 42:54.616
I don't really have a lot to smile about.

42:55.409 --> 42:57.119
I can barely leave my room.

42:59.580 --> 43:01.540
Well, I've lived in this house
my whole life.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.791
Really?

43:02.791 --> 43:05.294
I did leave once, when I was 18.

43:05.878 --> 43:07.838
I had this custom board

43:07.838 --> 43:10.340
of all the California beaches
I was gonna surf.

43:10.340 --> 43:15.012
Made it all the way to New York City
before I turned back around.

43:15.012 --> 43:16.555
Why'd you turn around?

43:16.555 --> 43:19.725
I just realised everything I need is here.

43:20.309 --> 43:22.227
And my mom got sick. So...

43:24.229 --> 43:25.939
I stayed to take care of her.

43:27.774 --> 43:29.193
Why couldn't your dad do it?

43:30.694 --> 43:32.154
Lift up your arms.

43:35.073 --> 43:36.992
I had to switch schools...

43:37.993 --> 43:40.579
after I had a sleepover in ninth grade
and everybody found out

43:40.579 --> 43:43.874
that I still slept
in my parents' room sometimes, so...

43:46.418 --> 43:50.881
It turned into this rumour
that I slept in the same bed with them...

43:52.216 --> 43:54.801
and then it became
that I had sex with them.

43:57.930 --> 43:58.931
It was awful.

43:59.556 --> 44:02.267
Probably why I spend so much time alone.

44:02.267 --> 44:03.769
You don't have any friends?

44:03.769 --> 44:07.314
Yeah, I have tons of friends, just online.

44:10.526 --> 44:12.903
Having Jody in my life helped a lot too.

44:14.321 --> 44:15.155
Who?

44:15.906 --> 44:17.950
- Jody's my old nanny.
- Turn around.

44:28.544 --> 44:31.171
I'm sorry
I couldn't have sex with you today.

44:32.756 --> 44:35.843
I guess I'm just a bit of a romantic.

44:36.885 --> 44:37.719
It's okay.

44:38.887 --> 44:41.348
Maybe we could spend the day
together tomorrow?

44:41.974 --> 44:43.767
Then, I promise, I'll put out.

44:46.812 --> 44:47.646
Sounds nice.

45:00.284 --> 45:01.743
It's just, like, swish.

45:02.703 --> 45:03.620
What's that?

45:15.007 --> 45:17.009
No blocking sensors!

45:17.593 --> 45:19.011
You! You're out!

45:32.191 --> 45:34.193
- Frisbee thing and then the smallest...
- Yeah.

45:38.322 --> 45:39.740
Yeah. Got it, got it.

45:39.740 --> 45:40.657
Bye!

45:40.657 --> 45:41.867
Get a life.

45:48.207 --> 45:49.208
There.

45:51.418 --> 45:53.337
You can finally drink while you're at bat.

45:53.337 --> 45:56.006
You get me. What else?

45:57.174 --> 45:58.008
Close your eyes.

46:00.302 --> 46:01.845
And stick out your finger.

46:05.349 --> 46:06.892
Now you're stuck with me forever.

46:07.976 --> 46:09.186
It's a finger trap.

46:10.771 --> 46:11.897
Percy, get me out of this.

46:11.897 --> 46:14.274
Stop pulling away.
Stop pulling away. Relax.

46:14.775 --> 46:15.776
Just push in.

46:26.453 --> 46:28.872
Do you think we would've been friends
in high school?

46:28.872 --> 46:30.165
Yeah, I think so.

46:30.749 --> 46:32.876
I don't know.
I feel like you were, like...

46:33.544 --> 46:35.128
prom queen or something.

46:35.921 --> 46:37.422
I didn't even go to prom.

46:38.215 --> 46:39.925
What? Nobody asked you?

46:39.925 --> 46:42.594
Everybody asked me. Teachers asked me.

46:43.220 --> 46:45.806
I had a date, and a dress, and...

46:45.806 --> 46:47.182
What happened?

46:47.182 --> 46:49.268
It was a long time ago. Who cares?

46:50.561 --> 46:51.770
I care.

46:54.147 --> 46:57.317
Well, you asked
why my dad didn't take care of my mom

46:57.317 --> 46:58.527
when she was sick.

46:59.319 --> 47:02.114
It's 'cause he was in the city
with his family.

47:03.115 --> 47:04.366
They summer here.

47:06.159 --> 47:07.452
They had an affair.

47:09.955 --> 47:11.331
And then I came along.

47:12.249 --> 47:15.169
I was just a mess
that he didn't wanna deal with.

47:15.169 --> 47:18.213
So he had his lawyers clean everything up,

47:18.213 --> 47:21.758
gave my mom some money
and a house to make us go away.

47:23.218 --> 47:26.513
Years later, I wrote my dad a letter

47:26.513 --> 47:29.141
asking why he wanted nothing
to do with me.

47:30.058 --> 47:32.102
But on the morning of prom...

47:33.020 --> 47:36.148
I got the letter returned, unopened.

47:38.817 --> 47:41.528
And so after that,
I didn't wanna go to prom.

47:41.528 --> 47:43.614
I didn't wanna--
I didn't wanna do anything.

47:43.614 --> 47:46.408
I just stayed in my room and cried.

47:47.409 --> 47:49.745
Why didn't you reach back out to him?

47:51.079 --> 47:54.124
'Cause fuck him. He left.
He can reach out.

47:58.337 --> 47:59.171
What?

48:00.797 --> 48:02.174
Can I kiss you?

48:23.487 --> 48:24.363
It's Jody.

48:25.364 --> 48:26.365
Who?

48:26.949 --> 48:29.117
Jody. My nanny. Remember?

48:29.117 --> 48:31.328
-"Meet at the lighthouse."
- Yeah.

48:31.912 --> 48:32.746
Okay.

48:33.997 --> 48:36.083
You sure you don't wanna
just go back to my house?

48:36.083 --> 48:37.501
I'm still horny from that kiss.

48:37.501 --> 48:38.877
Yes, Jody!

48:39.503 --> 48:40.838
- Hi.
- There he is.

48:40.838 --> 48:42.214
The tickle prince.

48:44.716 --> 48:46.260
So this must be the famous Maddie.

48:46.844 --> 48:49.388
And you're Jody.
You were Percy's nanny?

48:49.388 --> 48:50.806
Mr Mary Poppins.

48:52.724 --> 48:55.519
You guys stayed pretty close, huh?

48:55.519 --> 48:57.271
Oh, yeah. Super close.

48:58.438 --> 48:59.648
What'd you win there, pal?

49:00.440 --> 49:02.442
- Is that a Frisbee?
- Oh, yeah, Maddie won it.

49:02.442 --> 49:03.777
- Nice.
- Look at that.

49:03.777 --> 49:05.863
- Maddie, score!
- Yeah.

49:05.863 --> 49:07.239
Hey, Perce, go long.

49:11.994 --> 49:13.078
I got it.

49:13.662 --> 49:16.540
- Real motor on that little guy.
- What the fuck do you want?

49:18.500 --> 49:21.211
- Excuse me?
- It's his parents' money, not his.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.881
You like little kids or something?

49:23.881 --> 49:25.883
Do I like little kids?
You're a male nanny.

49:25.883 --> 49:27.551
What do you want from him?

49:27.551 --> 49:29.469
Same thing as you. I wanna date him.

49:32.014 --> 49:34.892
I have nannied for a lot
of powerful families out here.

49:34.892 --> 49:36.727
So if you hurt him...

49:37.519 --> 49:38.812
I'll hurt you.

49:38.812 --> 49:40.898
What are you gonna do?
Throw a pacifier at me?

49:41.732 --> 49:43.108
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

49:44.026 --> 49:45.903
It was in a prickle bush, but I got it.

49:45.903 --> 49:47.196
That's incredible.

49:49.656 --> 49:52.159
Okay, are you ready for your gift?

49:52.159 --> 49:53.160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.494
I'm bringing it out.

49:57.372 --> 50:00.125
Oh, my God...

50:00.918 --> 50:02.002
Did you find this?

50:02.002 --> 50:03.921
Figured it would get him
into surfing early.

50:03.921 --> 50:05.297
Wow, this is...

50:06.256 --> 50:07.716
- It turns on.
- It does?

50:07.716 --> 50:09.843
Why don't we see if that makes it better?

50:09.843 --> 50:12.179
Yeah, I have batteries somewhere.

50:12.179 --> 50:13.388
Nice.

50:15.807 --> 50:16.892
No.

50:18.894 --> 50:20.729
Hey, how's the Buick thing working out?

50:20.729 --> 50:22.981
- I haven't gotten it.
- Really?

50:26.193 --> 50:27.194
Why?

50:29.655 --> 50:32.658
I mean, they haven't given it to you yet?

50:32.658 --> 50:34.493
You could sue them for that, you know.

50:34.493 --> 50:36.578
Actually, we haven't had sex yet.

50:37.496 --> 50:39.831
He just needs more of a connection first.

50:39.831 --> 50:42.376
I actually really like him.
We're becoming friends.

50:45.712 --> 50:48.340
He's gonna forget about me.
He's going to college in the fall.

50:48.340 --> 50:49.383
I don't know.

50:49.383 --> 50:51.510
Well, it's happening tonight.
We're getting dinner.

50:52.177 --> 50:53.679
You're going to dinner.

50:53.679 --> 50:56.139
Okay, so you're, like,
"dating" dating, then.

50:56.139 --> 50:57.140
Shut up.

51:00.644 --> 51:02.062
I know what I'm doing.

51:09.444 --> 51:10.529
Maddie.

51:11.530 --> 51:13.031
It's me, Doug Khan.

51:13.991 --> 51:16.743
We went to high school together.
Remember? I...

51:17.327 --> 51:18.662
I ran varsity track?

51:19.329 --> 51:21.415
I had that sweet cherry-red Miata?

51:23.250 --> 51:25.669
I had sex with our Spanish teacher,
Mrs Walsh.

51:25.669 --> 51:29.464
Doug Khan! You were on TV.

51:29.464 --> 51:31.008
Didn't Miss Walsh go to jail?

51:31.008 --> 51:31.925
No.

51:32.759 --> 51:34.136
Mrs Khan did.

51:35.179 --> 51:36.180
We got married.

51:36.722 --> 51:37.806
But, you know...

51:39.099 --> 51:40.392
they never run that story.

51:40.392 --> 51:42.019
How can I help you, Doug?

51:42.019 --> 51:44.396
Well, I'm a real estate broker now.

51:45.147 --> 51:48.275
I don't have to tell you,
this is a fabulous neighbourhood.

51:48.275 --> 51:50.319
I mean, an acre on this street?

51:51.403 --> 51:52.446
Name your price, Maddie.

51:52.446 --> 51:54.865
- It was great catching up, Doug.
- Listen, come on.

51:54.865 --> 51:58.493
If you don't pay off your lien,
the county's gonna fire-sale your house.

51:58.493 --> 52:01.747
You'll lose half of what it's worth.
Let me list it, you'll get full price.

52:01.747 --> 52:05.501
So they can tear this whole thing down?
Stay off my yard, Doug.

52:43.038 --> 52:44.414
Was this a stupid idea?

52:44.414 --> 52:47.292
No, I love it.
We're finally going to prom.

52:48.502 --> 52:49.837
I have something for you.

52:55.926 --> 52:57.177
I have this.

52:57.970 --> 52:59.429
It's from my garden.

53:00.097 --> 53:01.181
Careful.

53:06.353 --> 53:09.648
You look very handsome.
Should we take a picture?

53:11.650 --> 53:14.403
I left my phone at home. On purpose.

53:14.403 --> 53:15.946
- What?
- Yeah.

53:15.946 --> 53:17.948
- I don't believe you.
- No, I did.

53:17.948 --> 53:19.992
- I don't believe you.
- No! I don't have it.

53:19.992 --> 53:22.744
I did. I did. I just wanna talk to you.

53:35.340 --> 53:36.383
Just crack it.

53:36.383 --> 53:38.177
The claws are still sharp!

53:39.803 --> 53:43.223
This is so much better
than if I actually went to my prom.

53:43.932 --> 53:44.892
Why didn't you?

53:46.393 --> 53:48.187
I just didn't ask anybody.

53:48.187 --> 53:49.396
Why?

53:49.396 --> 53:51.106
I don't know. I guess...

53:52.858 --> 53:56.486
After everything that happened at school,
I just wanted to stay invisible.

53:59.198 --> 54:00.866
If they couldn't see me,
they couldn't make fun of me.

54:01.742 --> 54:04.703
People should see who you are.
You're great.

54:06.455 --> 54:07.289
Thanks.

54:15.506 --> 54:17.508
- What?
- Play something.

54:17.508 --> 54:18.842
No.

54:18.842 --> 54:21.345
You said you play.
You should play something.

54:21.345 --> 54:22.721
I'm not going to play.

54:23.472 --> 54:25.182
If you don't play something,

54:25.182 --> 54:27.226
I'm gonna make a toast
to the entire restaurant

54:27.226 --> 54:28.852
about what an amazing lover you are.

54:30.229 --> 54:32.523
Good. It's time they find out.

54:34.149 --> 54:35.734
Stop, stop, stop.

54:38.987 --> 54:41.323
What do you want me to play?

54:41.323 --> 54:43.992
Doesn't matter.
Play anything. Play it for me.

54:45.661 --> 54:46.495
Fuck.

54:47.287 --> 54:48.121
Fuck.

54:48.872 --> 54:50.374
Fuck me. Fuck.

54:52.167 --> 54:53.502
Okay. Okay.

54:55.170 --> 54:56.004
Fuck.

55:39.256 --> 55:42.176
<i>She'll only come out at night</i>

55:43.969 --> 55:46.305
<i>The lean and hungry type</i>

55:48.140 --> 55:53.187
<i>Nothing is new
I've seen her here before</i>

55:56.398 --> 55:59.109
<i>Watching and waiting</i>

55:59.860 --> 56:05.782
<i>Oh, she's sitting with you
But her eyes are on the door</i>

56:11.663 --> 56:13.999
<i>So many have paid to see</i>

56:15.042 --> 56:18.045
<i>What you think you're getting for free</i>

56:18.921 --> 56:20.714
<i>The woman is wild</i>

56:20.714 --> 56:25.469
<i>A she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar</i>

56:26.261 --> 56:28.013
<i>Money's the matter</i>

56:29.264 --> 56:31.141
<i>If you're in it for love</i>

56:31.141 --> 56:34.228
<i>You ain't gonna get too far</i>

56:40.526 --> 56:42.778
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

56:43.946 --> 56:47.366
<i>Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up</i>

56:47.366 --> 56:50.202
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

56:50.202 --> 56:52.746
<i>She's a maneater</i>

56:54.289 --> 56:56.708
<i>I wouldn't if I were you</i>

56:57.709 --> 57:00.003
<i>I know what she can do</i>

57:01.004 --> 57:07.261
<i>She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart</i>

57:08.095 --> 57:09.680
<i>Mind over matter</i>

57:10.889 --> 57:15.727
<i>Oh, the beauty is there
But a beast is in the heart</i>

57:21.191 --> 57:23.569
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

57:24.611 --> 57:27.865
<i>Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up</i>

57:27.865 --> 57:30.576
<i>Oh, here she comes</i>

57:30.576 --> 57:33.036
<i>She's a maneater</i>

57:58.103 --> 57:59.271
Yes!

58:05.777 --> 58:06.820
What the fuck?

58:08.238 --> 58:09.406
That was unbelievable.

58:09.907 --> 58:11.450
How did you even know that song?

58:12.117 --> 58:16.121
We talked about "Maneater,"
so I went home and learned it.

58:16.121 --> 58:17.873
What are you?

58:17.873 --> 58:19.208
Percy.

58:19.208 --> 58:22.711
- Natalie. Oh, my God. That's so funny.
- Hi. That was amazing.

58:22.711 --> 58:25.631
Oh, my God.
Dude, I haven't seen you in so long.

58:25.631 --> 58:27.758
My parents said
that you're going to Princeton.

58:27.758 --> 58:29.718
- Yeah.
- I am too.

58:29.718 --> 58:32.179
- Oh, my God, that's so great!
- How funny is that? I know!

58:32.179 --> 58:33.263
That's amazing.

58:34.598 --> 58:35.641
Maddie, this is Maddie.

58:35.641 --> 58:38.852
Maddie. So nice to meet you.
Are you friends with his parents too?

58:38.852 --> 58:40.145
No.

58:41.230 --> 58:43.524
- So are you excited?
- Yes! So excited.

58:43.524 --> 58:47.694
Except it's wild, I look at all, like,
the freshman girls at my high school...

58:48.862 --> 58:53.825
and I don't know.
I just feel so old. You know?

58:53.825 --> 58:56.495
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So good to see you.

58:56.495 --> 59:00.374
I don't know what you're doing later,
but there's this party that I'm going to.

59:00.374 --> 59:02.751
There's gonna be a bunch
of Princeton people there.

59:02.751 --> 59:05.379
We have plans, but thank you so much.

59:05.379 --> 59:07.798
Oh, dang. I can send you the address.

59:07.798 --> 59:09.883
He didn't bring his phone. So...

59:09.883 --> 59:11.844
- Oh, I can give you the address.
- No need.

59:11.844 --> 59:13.136
- Can't hurt.
- Might hurt.

59:15.180 --> 59:18.934
- 31 Amagansett Road.
- It was so nice to meet you.

59:20.477 --> 59:23.355
Oh, my God. Next year is
gonna be so fun. I can't wait.

59:23.355 --> 59:25.899
- That's so exciting. Yeah.
- Okay. So nice to run into you.

59:25.899 --> 59:28.735
- So nice to meet you, ma'am.
- Bye. Have a good night.

59:28.735 --> 59:29.862
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Bye.

59:31.113 --> 59:32.114
So funny.

59:32.865 --> 59:35.784
Don't remember ordering
a phoney bitch for dessert.

59:36.368 --> 59:37.995
Natalie's, like, super nice.

59:37.995 --> 59:40.998
Well, anyway. I can't believe
you can do that, but you can't drive.

59:40.998 --> 59:45.043
Yeah, actually, so I've been thinking
about getting my licence.

59:45.043 --> 59:47.254
- That's great.
- Yeah? Good.

59:47.254 --> 59:51.508
You know, 'cause Princeton's
like five hours away by train,

59:52.092 --> 59:53.760
but if I have a car, then I can--

59:53.760 --> 59:56.471
It'll be a lot easier for me
to come back here on the weekends.

59:58.515 --> 59:59.725
Well, you're gonna--

01:00:00.767 --> 01:00:03.645
You're gonna wanna spend
the weekends in school.

01:00:04.229 --> 01:00:05.939
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:09.193
You can always come visit me.

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:11.403
Well, I don't have a car.

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:14.364
Oh, you could take the train.
It's only five hours.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.824
Yeah.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.871
I just don't really--
I don't do long distance.

01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:24.875
You know,
I hear Montauk is the best in the fall.

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:27.169
All the summer people are gone. So...

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:32.132
It's a lot of travel.

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:37.179
I don't know what you want.

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:43.852
Just wanna have fun tonight
and not talk about all this stuff.

01:00:48.106 --> 01:00:49.691
I'd like to leave, please.

01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:52.903
Are you serious?

01:00:52.903 --> 01:00:53.820
Yes.

01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:56.657
It's my prom too.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:00.035
Fuck.

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:14.049
- I'm just trying to be realistic.
- Yeah.

01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:16.260
Me too.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.316
You're drinking now?

01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:34.236
Yeah. I love vermouth.

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.283
I'm going to college soon.
I need to know how to drink, right?

01:01:45.038 --> 01:01:46.206
Where are we going?

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:49.543
It's a shortcut.

01:01:59.428 --> 01:02:00.637
The Princeton party?

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:02.764
You said I needed to hang out
with people my own age, right?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.100
Well, I didn't mean tonight.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.476
Then don't come.

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:11.732
Party!

01:02:58.028 --> 01:02:59.530
Do you guys know Percy?

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:03.242
Do you know Percy?

01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:05.911
Yo, yo, what's going on, you guys?
It's your boy, Cameron B.

01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:09.623
We are kicking the summer off right
at a sick house party in Montauk.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:12.459
Now me. Yo, what's up?
It's me, Trash Gucci.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:15.170
If you or someone you know
is being bullied,

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.922
never be afraid to speak up.

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:18.715
- Bullying is not a--
- Excuse me, ma'am.

01:03:18.715 --> 01:03:21.093
Can you not do that
while we're recording? Thank you.

01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:23.178
Just getting a beer, Frosted.

01:03:23.178 --> 01:03:24.555
Did she just call me Frosted?

01:03:24.555 --> 01:03:26.682
That, my friends,
is what we call a bully, huh?

01:03:26.682 --> 01:03:29.852
Oh, no, not a phone.
Someone help, I'm being filmed.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.564
Have you seen Percy?

01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:37.025
Oh, yo, <i>mami.</i> How old are you?

01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:38.986
Twenty-three.

01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:40.612
Damn, you old as fuck.

01:03:40.612 --> 01:03:44.157
- No disrespect. He loves cougars.
- I fuck with the big cats.

01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:46.285
Why don't you two big cats
fuck each other, then?

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:49.955
- Is that an insult?
- Shut the front door.

01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:51.957
It sure is, professor.

01:03:51.957 --> 01:03:54.793
Why is us having sex
with each other an insult? I'm confused.

01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:58.005
- Say what you just said. Say that again.
- No, I didn't mean it in a homophobic way.

01:03:58.005 --> 01:03:59.923
How'd you mean it, then?

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.384
It was a joke. I'm not--
I've been with girls.

01:04:02.384 --> 01:04:04.219
I'm not homophobic.

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:07.055
Where the fuck did you come from?
Stop filming me. No comment.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.475
Whose mom is that?

01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:14.855
Have you seen Percy?

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.650
Oh, my God.

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:20.736
Was that funny?

01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:22.654
He's with Natalie upstairs.

01:04:24.448 --> 01:04:25.574
Hey!

01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:34.124
Move! Coming through.

01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:37.753
- Percy?
- Yeah?

01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:39.296
Wait, your name's Percy?

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:40.422
Yeah.

01:04:42.508 --> 01:04:43.550
Percy?

01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:46.053
Sorry. Continue.

01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.221
Percy?

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.266
Doesn't anyone fuck anymore?

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:55.729
Percy?

01:04:56.313 --> 01:04:57.314
Percy?

01:04:58.315 --> 01:04:59.691
Open this door!

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:00.776
Percy!

01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:04.446
Percy, open this door.
This is your last chance.

01:05:15.749 --> 01:05:18.085
- Did you fuck him?
- Oh, my God.

01:05:18.836 --> 01:05:20.003
Did you fuck him?

01:05:20.003 --> 01:05:21.672
Calm down. Please, nothing happened.

01:05:21.672 --> 01:05:22.881
The room is spinning.

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.299
You're drunk already?

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:27.135
No, he took something.
I don't know. I think it was a pill.

01:05:27.135 --> 01:05:31.515
Percy? Did you take something?
Percy, did you take a pill?

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:35.853
Come...

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:43.110
Stick your fingers down your throat.
Make yourself throw up.

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.279
- I don't wanna.
- Deeper, deeper.

01:05:48.198 --> 01:05:49.199
No.

01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:50.951
Let me do it!

01:05:59.084 --> 01:06:00.210
Do you feel better?

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:03.630
Not even at all.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.259
I didn't know
you couldn't drink on Ibuprofen.

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:09.928
That's what you took?

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:14.516
- Found her.
- Okay, who told the joke?

01:06:14.516 --> 01:06:16.018
Your fucking parents are here?

01:06:16.018 --> 01:06:19.438
You think our son would have
a party without our consent?

01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:21.607
That's it. Come on. You don't belong here.

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:24.484
I don't belong here?
I've fucking lived here my whole life!

01:06:24.484 --> 01:06:25.569
You don't belong here.

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:28.989
You don't belong
at a high-school party, miss.

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.991
Oh, well, yeah-- We're leaving.

01:06:30.991 --> 01:06:32.576
- Let me get--
- Stay away from her.

01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:33.619
Stay back. Okay?

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:36.121
- I said, let go of her--
- Stay back!

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:38.332
- Get out of here. Come on.
- Don't touch me! Percy--

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:43.253
Oh, shi-- Oh, fuck! Oh, sh-- Maddie.

01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:49.843
Fuck!

01:06:50.677 --> 01:06:51.678
We should go.

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:05.651
I just want you to know
I would never hurt you.

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:09.947
I know.

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:15.911
I'm ready for you.

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:18.872
Are you sure?

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:19.873
Yes.

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:23.418
Okay.

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:25.295
I...

01:07:34.304 --> 01:07:36.723
I don't know.
Where's the perforation?

01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:39.977
Let me help you.

01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:47.568
I love you.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.201
Percy, you're drunk.

01:07:57.536 --> 01:07:58.537
A little.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:03.458
Is that all right?
I mean, I still love you.

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:06.378
I don't think we should do this
when you're drunk.

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:08.589
Not for your first time.

01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:10.465
Okay.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:15.012
I think we should wait.

01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:17.471
If that's what you want.

01:08:19.808 --> 01:08:20.975
That's what I want.

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:34.907
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:38.076
- Fun night?
- Yeah, yeah, really fun.

01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:39.328
That's good.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:42.456
Hey, I'll drive you to work. We can chat.

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:45.792
Actually,
would it be all right if I drive?

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:50.546
I'm thinking about getting my licence,
so, you know, I could use the practice.

01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.508
My son, the licenced driver?

01:08:52.508 --> 01:08:55.385
Yeah, it'll just...
You know, if I have a car,

01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:57.054
it'll be easier to see my girlfriend.

01:08:58.764 --> 01:08:59.973
Your girlfriend?

01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:04.685
Yeah. Her name is Maddie.

01:09:05.437 --> 01:09:08.357
She's on the older side.
But she's really, really fun.

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:10.734
- Fun's important.
- Yeah.

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:14.947
She doesn't really wanna do long-distance,
so I'm not gonna go to Princeton.

01:09:16.782 --> 01:09:17.616
What?

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:21.787
Just, you know, Maddie's here.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.663
Just makes sense for us.

01:09:23.663 --> 01:09:25.122
You're going to Princeton.

01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:27.000
I'm not.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:29.670
- I'm 19.
- Okay.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.129
I'm an adult now.

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.341
I can make my own decisions.
And I'm going to stay here, okay?

01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:39.304
Sweetie, why don't you go wait in the car?
And Daddy will be right out.

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:45.143
What the fuck was that?

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:51.524
Just relax, okay?

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:55.237
You drive for a living.
Let me take this one.

01:09:57.948 --> 01:10:01.577
She's angling for the Tesla.
Call her right now. I'm gonna yell at her.

01:10:01.577 --> 01:10:03.036
- You're gonna yell at her?
- Yeah.

01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:06.248
You're gonna yell at the one person
who can convince him to go to college?

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:08.250
- You're right. You're right.
- I know.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.502
You think that they...? That...?

01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:12.045
Call her. Call her now.

01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:20.179
Hi.

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.598
I was gonna call you.

01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:24.558
Listen, I don't think I can do this.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:26.643
<i>Percy has gotten way too attached.</i>

01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:28.896
You can have the car.

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.064
Really?

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:33.317
Even though we didn't...?

01:10:33.317 --> 01:10:36.987
You got him out of his shell,
and that's all we wanted.

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:40.324
But now he's got this idea
that he wants to stay in Montauk,

01:10:40.324 --> 01:10:43.869
and you need to convince him
that he has to go to college.

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:47.331
Yeah.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.126
Great. Great.
I'll sign over the title today.

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:57.216
<i>So if I can convince him
to go to Princeton, I get the car?</i>

01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:59.134
<i>I don't have to have sex with him anymore?</i>

01:10:59.134 --> 01:11:01.220
- Hello? Maddie? Hello?
- Maddie?

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.137
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:49.518 --> 01:11:50.519
Can I try some wine?

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.272
- Yeah.
- Sure.

01:11:53.272 --> 01:11:54.356
I think that's okay.

01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:04.908
Okay. That's good.

01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:05.826
Easy there.

01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:17.337
Sweetie, please.

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:20.382
- You wanna savour it. Savour it.
- Yeah.

01:12:35.814 --> 01:12:37.858
Did I double-book?

01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:48.076
Aren't you guys gonna
ask Maddie about herself?

01:12:49.286 --> 01:12:52.456
Oh, Maddie, where are you--?
Where are you from?

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.709
Here, actually. I'm from here.

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.420
Yeah, in fact, she's never--
You've never left, right?

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.173
It's so beautiful here, I don't blame you.

01:13:02.382 --> 01:13:03.550
This chicken is delicious.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:04.718
Oh, thank you.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:07.679
- Mom, you didn't make it. Inez did.
- Percy.

01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:11.850
Well, the important thing is
that it's delicious.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.727
I think the important thing is the truth.

01:13:14.811 --> 01:13:18.065
And I haven't been
entirely truthful with you all.

01:13:18.065 --> 01:13:20.776
I didn't get the dates wrong.

01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:23.737
I just wanted to introduce you to them,

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:25.906
but I didn't know how to explain
how old you are.

01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:32.579
Well, I'm not that old.

01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:34.915
I actually know someone

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:37.793
who married
our high school Spanish teacher.

01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:39.711
Forty-year age difference.

01:13:39.711 --> 01:13:42.214
Forty years?
And that's how old you are, right?

01:13:42.214 --> 01:13:43.131
No.

01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:47.678
You guys aren't gonna ask us how we met?

01:13:50.222 --> 01:13:51.223
How'd you meet?

01:13:51.223 --> 01:13:54.309
Do you wanna tell them?
No, I'll tell them. This is so us.

01:13:54.309 --> 01:13:57.855
It's actually really random.
Maddie came in to adopt a dog.

01:13:57.855 --> 01:14:02.359
Yeah, but I rejected her application
because she was totally unqualified.

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:03.652
But we still hit it off.

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:05.863
I mean, the first day we met,
I had to Mace her,

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:07.030
she was so fucking horny.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:08.824
Percy. Percy, be a gentleman.

01:14:08.824 --> 01:14:11.243
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:14.705
We actually have a lot in common.
In four years, we'll both be seniors.

01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:18.584
Oh, I'm so-- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:14:18.584 --> 01:14:21.044
I have to get this,
but keep getting to know each other,

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:22.462
you know, chat.

01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:23.672
My favourite people.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.178
- Did you tell him?
- No.

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:34.725
I brought tools.

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:36.935
We need to move fast.
We're in the middle of dinner.

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:40.355
- What are you having?
- Roasted chicken and salad.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:42.316
I fucking love salad.

01:14:50.908 --> 01:14:52.659
She's gonna hate not having hubcaps.

01:14:58.624 --> 01:14:59.708
It's very simple.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:03.128
She broke your heart, you break the car,
since that's all she cares about.

01:15:04.505 --> 01:15:06.715
She was just like
every other thing in my life:

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:08.926
Planned by my parents.

01:15:17.601 --> 01:15:19.978
Fuck! It's not doing anything.

01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:22.231
Goddamn American-built.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:33.951
- Yeah. Yeah! Okay.
- Yeah.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:42.709
That'll teach her.

01:15:47.339 --> 01:15:49.007
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there he is.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:51.718
Everything all right?

01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:05.607
Hey.

01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:08.652
How we doing?

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.613
Where were you?

01:16:15.325 --> 01:16:16.618
You okay? I--

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:18.829
Percy, your parents are downstairs.

01:16:19.454 --> 01:16:21.039
I really don't think they mind.

01:16:21.707 --> 01:16:26.420
- Well, can we just talk? God!
- Stop. What's--? My wrist.

01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:31.758
What's going on?

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:38.432
I'm just a little confused.

01:16:39.016 --> 01:16:40.100
Because I--

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.644
Because I thought you wanted
to have sex with me.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.188
So...

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:48.108
If there's something I don't know,
just tell me.

01:16:50.986 --> 01:16:52.070
No.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:53.447
No?

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:54.656
No.

01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:57.743
I want to. Let's do it.

01:17:00.704 --> 01:17:01.872
Let's have sex.

01:17:02.623 --> 01:17:05.000
This is what you want?
This will make you happy?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.044
Yeah. Yep.

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:08.545
Great.

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:34.696
What--? What do I do?

01:17:34.696 --> 01:17:35.781
Get on top.

01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:44.164
- Okay. Yes.
- Okay. And now...

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.084
Okay, I'll help you.

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:49.336
Percy, you're not...

01:17:50.212 --> 01:17:51.922
- And then I'll help you--
- Oh, fuck!

01:18:04.142 --> 01:18:05.352
Did you come too?

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:06.979
No.

01:18:10.774 --> 01:18:12.401
That was my thighs.

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:15.904
Just gonna...

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:31.003
By the way, your car is in the forest,
crushed by a tree.

01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:32.629
What?

01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:37.467
I had some kind of stupid idea
that you actually liked me.

01:18:39.428 --> 01:18:40.470
Percy.

01:18:41.054 --> 01:18:42.514
Was any of it real?

01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:43.807
Yes.

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:47.477
It is real. I've told you things
I've never told anybody.

01:18:49.396 --> 01:18:53.192
I was just trying to save my house.
It wasn't personal.

01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:55.819
It felt personal to me.

01:18:55.819 --> 01:18:59.781
- Percy, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
- You should go, I think.

01:19:21.762 --> 01:19:24.431
The truth is,
one day I'll live in Paris or something,

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:27.643
and I'll come back to visit Montauk
and you'll still be here.

01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:33.857
How much money do your parents have?

01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:37.444
Why don't you go ask them?
I know you guys are close.

01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:40.614
But you're rich, right?
You never have to worry about money.

01:19:42.115 --> 01:19:45.160
So my life is amazing, right?
I have no problems.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.787
I'm gonna lose my house.

01:19:49.081 --> 01:19:51.500
And I don't have a rich dad
that can help me.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.835
Actually, Maddie, you do.

01:19:52.835 --> 01:19:54.837
And you're gonna waste
your life in that house

01:19:54.837 --> 01:19:56.839
waiting for him to come back
and apologise.

01:19:57.464 --> 01:20:00.300
Because that's really why
you never made it past New York, right?

01:20:50.934 --> 01:20:52.311
What? Gary, no.

01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:54.146
No, no, no.

01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:55.981
This is not my car.

01:20:55.981 --> 01:20:59.902
Well, your name's on the title.
It's your car.

01:21:01.904 --> 01:21:04.239
What am I supposed to do
with a car that doesn't run?

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:06.116
Who says it doesn't run?

01:21:08.452 --> 01:21:10.287
These things are built to last.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.165
Unlike us.

01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:16.752
What?

01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:20.255
I didn't say anything.

01:21:30.974 --> 01:21:32.643
What the fuck, you guys?

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:34.269
Percy, language.

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:37.481
You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore. I'm the parents now.

01:21:38.482 --> 01:21:41.151
What other stuff have you been
doing for me I don't know about?

01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:45.781
That time I beat you in basketball,
did you let me win?

01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:48.408
No. You beat me fair and square.

01:21:48.408 --> 01:21:49.618
What about Kyle McElroy?

01:21:50.452 --> 01:21:52.120
Kyle McElroy.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.123
The kid who bullied me.
Did you have him expelled?

01:21:55.123 --> 01:21:59.169
No. I was told it was a dream of his
to go to military school.

01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:02.881
Okay. Whatever this is, it's done.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:07.135
You can't track me anymore.
I'm changing my phone passcode.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:08.136
To what?

01:22:08.804 --> 01:22:11.223
Okay, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:22:11.223 --> 01:22:13.350
I know you're trying to help me,
but you're not.

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:18.772
You have to let me fail
or succeed on my own.

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:20.858
Understood?

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.152
Okay, you can go.

01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:26.196
Okay.

01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.952
- Stop! Leave it.
- Yeah.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:56.935
Kelly?

01:22:58.228 --> 01:22:59.855
I have your picture.

01:23:02.566 --> 01:23:03.692
Get in.

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:07.237
- I'm not getting in that car.
- Get in.

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:15.370
<i>Finish him!</i>

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:22.044
<i>Fatality.</i>

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:58.539
To Maddie. You figured it out.

01:23:58.539 --> 01:24:01.291
Yeah. I mean,
that car's a little banged up.

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:03.919
Whatever, the summer's over.
We got our town back.

01:24:03.919 --> 01:24:06.213
And we can still have Thanksgiving
at my place.

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:10.717
- Yeah.
- What?

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:15.055
Okay. Fine, I'll do it.

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:16.348
Here it goes.

01:24:19.309 --> 01:24:21.144
Sara has something to tell you.

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:24.064
Thank you, Jim.

01:24:27.568 --> 01:24:30.112
- We're gonna move to Florida, I think.
- What?

01:24:30.696 --> 01:24:32.865
I know, I know,
we wouldn't if we didn't have to.

01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:34.950
You know that.
I don't wanna move to Florida.

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.619
We just can't afford
to buy our own place here.

01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:40.747
And we can't keep staying
with Jim's parents when the baby comes.

01:24:40.747 --> 01:24:43.709
- They only have one bathroom.
- Can't believe this.

01:24:44.376 --> 01:24:46.253
We're really out of options. I'm sorry.

01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:49.590
- Yeah. We wanna stay.
- Don't be mad.

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:54.094
I'm not mad. I just...
I can't believe you're leaving.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.055
Well, I can't believe you're staying.

01:24:58.307 --> 01:24:59.183
What does that mean?

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:03.395
You know what, I just--
My buddy's in the bathroom.

01:25:05.898 --> 01:25:10.110
I just mean that... I don't know.

01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:12.905
How long are you gonna keep doing this?

01:25:12.905 --> 01:25:15.991
Having sex for Buicks?
This is probably it.

01:25:15.991 --> 01:25:17.284
That wasn't what I meant.

01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:20.537
I did what I needed to do
to save my mom's house, okay?

01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:27.127
Yeah. You keep saying that,
but your mom wanted you to be happy.

01:25:28.128 --> 01:25:29.087
You don't seem happy.

01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:31.715
- I am happy.
- Are you?

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.553
I like my life here.

01:25:40.224 --> 01:25:41.225
All right.

01:25:42.935 --> 01:25:45.771
I should tell you I go back
to the city tomorrow morning.

01:25:45.771 --> 01:25:47.773
Oh, tomorrow?
Can't you go any sooner?

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:49.942
You're funny.

01:25:55.697 --> 01:25:59.660
What is this? A finger trap?
I used to love these things.

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.665
You okay?

01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:07.876
So do you live in the city?

01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:13.090
Have you been out here
for the whole summer or...?

01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:14.591
What is this, a questionnaire?

01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:17.386
I was trying to get to know you.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.555
I'm sorry.

01:26:24.268 --> 01:26:25.435
I have an idea.

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:27.688
Close your eyes for me?

01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:30.607
Come on, close them. Give me your finger.

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:35.404
Forward.

01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:37.406
Up.

01:26:37.406 --> 01:26:39.116
Okay, open your eyes.

01:26:39.116 --> 01:26:40.659
Oh, what the fuck?

01:26:40.659 --> 01:26:42.452
That's disgusting.

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:45.831
- Stop pulling on it!
- This was a gift from a friend.

01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:47.833
Don't pull it, don't pull it, don't--

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.626
You have to push in to get out.

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:50.752
I'm trying.

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.261
That was kind of weird, huh?

01:27:00.888 --> 01:27:01.889
Anyways.

01:27:02.973 --> 01:27:04.600
I live in Battery Park.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.517
Get out.

01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:07.186
Yeah.

01:27:40.594 --> 01:27:41.595
Here you go.

01:28:02.908 --> 01:28:04.117
<i>Doug Khan Realty.</i>

01:28:04.117 --> 01:28:07.120
<i>Doug. It's Maddie. I wanna sell.</i>

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.288
<i>Great!</i>

01:28:08.288 --> 01:28:10.749
<i>Don't get too excited. There's a catch.</i>

01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:17.297
Hey, is he here?

01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:18.882
No.

01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:23.095
Well, he won't return my calls or texts.
Will you tell him I came in?

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.264
Absolutely fucking not.

01:28:25.264 --> 01:28:26.431
Really?

01:28:26.431 --> 01:28:28.976
Yeah. You fucked up. He's a special guy.

01:28:32.813 --> 01:28:34.189
Cocaine!

01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:40.654
All right.

01:28:40.654 --> 01:28:42.114
Let's hear it.

01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:45.033
"My name is Jody and I'm a registered..."

01:28:45.033 --> 01:28:48.287
Remember when I said
I've made some powerful friends nannying?

01:28:48.287 --> 01:28:51.415
That includes
the Suffolk County tax assessor.

01:28:51.415 --> 01:28:54.126
And they're gonna make
your property taxes go up.

01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:55.711
Way up.

01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:57.087
I sold the house.

01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:05.012
Sorry, can I actually use your bathroom?
It's number two, so...

01:29:05.846 --> 01:29:06.847
Okay.

01:29:09.016 --> 01:29:10.100
It's Maddie.

01:29:10.976 --> 01:29:12.436
Can I talk to him?

01:29:12.436 --> 01:29:13.896
<i>He's not home.</i>

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:16.064
<i>He'll be at the Princeton mixer later.</i>

01:29:16.064 --> 01:29:18.108
Okay. Thanks.

01:29:45.844 --> 01:29:48.263
And there are several eating clubs
to choose from,

01:29:48.263 --> 01:29:49.932
if you make it to junior year.

01:29:51.808 --> 01:29:54.228
I can't wait to be eaten at Princeton.

01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:55.854
- What?
- I've tried calling you.

01:29:55.854 --> 01:29:57.523
You can't just ignore me.

01:29:57.523 --> 01:29:58.774
Leave me alone.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:00.484
Percy, don't shut me out.

01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:03.695
- I don't owe you anything.
- Stop.

01:30:03.695 --> 01:30:04.780
Percy.

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:08.492
I don't owe you anything.
I don't owe you anything.

01:30:08.492 --> 01:30:09.785
Well, I owe you something.

01:30:10.327 --> 01:30:12.120
Our friendship is real.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.165
You made me realise
I needed to push in to get out.

01:30:15.707 --> 01:30:18.544
I was hurt. So I hurt people.

01:30:19.294 --> 01:30:21.630
Percy. Percy.

01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:25.467
Percy, unlock the door.
Come on, open the door.

01:30:25.467 --> 01:30:26.677
Please, let's talk.

01:30:31.473 --> 01:30:32.307
What are you doing?

01:30:32.307 --> 01:30:35.310
Get off the hood.
I don't want anything to do with you.

01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:37.813
I'm not getting off until you talk to me.

01:30:39.064 --> 01:30:40.732
Then I guess we're doing this.

01:30:42.359 --> 01:30:45.863
Hey, okay. Easy. Easy. Fuck.

01:30:45.863 --> 01:30:47.948
This is scary.
I can't believe you did this.

01:30:47.948 --> 01:30:49.116
Then get off!

01:30:49.116 --> 01:30:52.619
No! Not until you believe me
that I care about you.

01:30:52.619 --> 01:30:55.664
You lied to me
just so you could get a fucking car.

01:30:55.664 --> 01:30:58.166
- You don't give a shit about me.
- Yes, I do.

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:00.002
Pull over! Let's talk!

01:31:01.336 --> 01:31:03.172
Get off the hood of my car!

01:31:03.589 --> 01:31:04.715
Make me!

01:31:06.508 --> 01:31:08.218
- Had enough?
- No!

01:31:08.218 --> 01:31:09.636
Oh, my God!

01:31:10.596 --> 01:31:15.267
- I can't see! You're blocking me!
- Oh, my God! Percy!

01:31:21.231 --> 01:31:22.316
Fire!

01:31:34.995 --> 01:31:35.871
Oh, shit.

01:31:36.496 --> 01:31:37.497
Oh, my God.

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:42.127
Oh, shit.

01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:50.135
Maddie?

01:31:50.135 --> 01:31:52.304
Maddie!

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.476
It's okay.

01:32:03.023 --> 01:32:04.066
I'm sorry.

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:06.276
I'm sorry.

01:32:28.715 --> 01:32:31.927
I just got my licence
and I've already ruined two cars.

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:35.639
The Buick's not ruined. I fixed it up.

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:39.726
It just needed a little love.

01:32:41.603 --> 01:32:43.689
My grandfather shot himself in that Buick.

01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:46.650
I'm kidding.

01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:49.528
You little shit.

01:32:50.571 --> 01:32:52.239
You're lucky I came back for you.

01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:54.449
Where would you be without me?

01:32:56.743 --> 01:32:59.371
I'd definitely still be a virgin.

01:33:00.873 --> 01:33:02.624
You're still a virgin, hotshot.

01:33:02.624 --> 01:33:04.001
No, that counts, actually.

01:33:05.627 --> 01:33:08.172
Well, you can tell your friends in college
whatever you want.

01:33:09.756 --> 01:33:11.341
If I make any friends.

01:33:13.886 --> 01:33:15.429
What do you mean? We're friends.

01:33:22.019 --> 01:33:24.646
I think we're probably gonna
come back out for Thanksgiving.

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:26.356
I won't be here.

01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:30.861
I sold the house.
I'm moving to California.

01:33:41.288 --> 01:33:42.623
You're gonna be okay.

01:33:45.751 --> 01:33:47.794
What are you, some kind of wise Buddha?

01:33:47.794 --> 01:33:50.088
I'm older than you. You're gonna be okay.

01:33:52.257 --> 01:33:53.592
We're both gonna be okay.

01:34:02.976 --> 01:34:03.810
Maddie?

01:34:04.353 --> 01:34:05.187
Yeah?

01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:06.813
It still counts.

01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:15.822
Am I being executed? Is that the surprise?

01:34:15.822 --> 01:34:16.949
No peeking!

01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:18.408
Yeah, no. This is good news.

01:34:18.408 --> 01:34:21.119
You're not blindfolding me
to tell me you're having an affair?

01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:22.371
All right.

01:34:26.834 --> 01:34:29.044
- What am I looking at?
- The house.

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:30.045
The house.

01:34:30.045 --> 01:34:32.047
Instead of selling it
to some rich asshole,

01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:33.799
I decided to sell it to you guys.

01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:36.009
Yeah, a regular asshole.

01:34:36.009 --> 01:34:38.887
Who had to sell one of the boats.

01:34:38.887 --> 01:34:40.389
Maddie, we can't.

01:34:40.389 --> 01:34:42.808
No, we can.
And she could've gotten more for it.

01:34:42.808 --> 01:34:44.268
I got enough.

01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:47.646
This is how we stay.
This is what we wanted.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.649
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:34:53.151 --> 01:34:53.986
Oh, wait.

01:34:55.821 --> 01:34:59.575
Oh, right, the thing you made.

01:34:59.575 --> 01:35:01.451
- There it is.
- Should we put it up?

01:35:02.619 --> 01:35:05.038
We will do that.
We're gonna do it as soon as you leave.

01:35:06.498 --> 01:35:08.417
Well, I guess this is it.

01:35:08.417 --> 01:35:12.588
- Call us as soon as you get there, okay?
- Or don't. Totally fine either way.

01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:13.672
Yeah. We're cool.

01:35:13.672 --> 01:35:16.258
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:18.635
Empty nesters. Finally.

01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:21.597
Yeah, come on. Get out of here, you.

01:35:27.853 --> 01:35:28.937
I love you guys.

01:35:28.937 --> 01:35:30.981
- And we love you so much.
- Love you too, huh?

01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:32.232
Please don't follow me out.

01:35:32.232 --> 01:35:33.650
- No.
- Okay.

01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:34.818
Okay.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:40.991
- Sure you don't want help with the bags?
- No, I got it.

01:35:47.623 --> 01:35:49.541
Well, let him do it.

01:35:49.541 --> 01:35:50.876
Yeah.

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.215
Honey.

01:35:59.927 --> 01:36:00.928
Yeah, that's it.

01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:02.930
- That's worth it.
- Yeah!

01:36:03.639 --> 01:36:04.473
Okay.

01:36:06.266 --> 01:36:09.353
- All right. All right, guys. See you.
- Bye, sweetie.

01:36:14.358 --> 01:36:15.192
Okay.

01:36:15.192 --> 01:36:17.444
- Nice! All right.
- Yeah.

01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:19.404
- I'll see you guys for Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

01:36:19.404 --> 01:36:20.322
Okay.

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:25.035
Wrong way.

01:36:25.035 --> 01:36:26.453
- Bye!
- Bye, sweetheart.

01:36:35.838 --> 01:36:37.881
Your Uber's here.

01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:40.050
I requested no conversation.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:43.971
Oh, we're talking, buddy.
All the way to Princeton.

01:36:43.971 --> 01:36:47.641
Then I'm gonna call you
for my whole drive to California.

01:36:47.641 --> 01:36:49.268
Tell you about my new boyfriend.

01:36:51.395 --> 01:36:52.479
New boyfriend?

01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:54.731
He's a former cop.

01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:55.941
Okay.

01:36:55.941 --> 01:36:58.068
He's had some drug addiction in the past.

01:37:00.195 --> 01:37:01.405
Do you want to meet him?

01:37:01.947 --> 01:37:02.781
No.

01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:05.409
Well, he really wants to meet you.
Come on!

01:37:05.409 --> 01:37:08.787
Milo! Hey! Hey.

01:37:11.832 --> 01:37:12.958
You ready to leave?

01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:15.335
Yeah.

01:37:16.378 --> 01:37:17.212
Are you?

01:37:17.212 --> 01:37:18.130
Yeah.
