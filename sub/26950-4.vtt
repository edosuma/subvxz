00:06.458 --> 00:10.250
(soft eerie music)

00:45.167 --> 00:46.375
(grunting)

00:46.917 --> 00:48.250
- What do you want?

00:48.250 --> 00:50.708
- I come to check my silver.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.667
- You'll get to count your
silver when the job's done.

00:52.667 --> 00:57.000
- I cannot let you
leave the ship without
giving me my pay.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.667
- Oh, believe me, brother,
I'm not leaving this ship
without you.

01:01.667 --> 01:04.500
- No!
I never leave the ship.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.417
Why are we here?!
Why do we come here?

01:10.042 --> 01:11.292
- It's for a woman.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.500
- You have a Madelena?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.375
What is her name?

01:17.917 --> 01:20.292
- Grace.
- (softly): Grace.

01:20.917 --> 01:23.417
- What are you two wee lassies
whispering about?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.583
- We've reached land.

01:25.583 --> 01:28.583
- Well, thank fuck for that.
Te Rangi!

01:30.667 --> 01:33.625
Never thought I'd say this,
but I wish I was still
on that ship.

01:33.625 --> 01:36.625
- Yes, MacDonald, even though
she does not like you,

01:36.625 --> 01:39.042
I am not surprised that
you want to be with her.

01:39.042 --> 01:42.583
- Listen, Captain Fortu-nutter,
technically we're on land now,

01:42.583 --> 01:45.083
so you watch what you say
or you're getting it tight.

01:45.083 --> 01:48.083
- No-no-no-no-no, my friend,
you misunderstand,

01:48.083 --> 01:50.375
I'm just trying to explain
my feeling. Huh?

01:50.375 --> 01:53.083
(in Maori):
<i> - He is in mourning,</i>
<i> show some respect.</i>

01:53.083 --> 01:56.333
<i> Leave him be,</i>
<i> you'll make him cry again.</i>

01:56.333 --> 01:59.792
(in Portuguese):
<i> - But maybe a good cry</i>
<i> will make him feel better.</i>

01:59.792 --> 02:01.958
- English, Cree, or silence.

02:02.542 --> 02:04.708
McTaggart, I need your help.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.500
Men and weapons.

02:08.167 --> 02:09.625
- Why you asking me?

02:09.625 --> 02:11.667
I told you
I didn't want to come back here.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.917
I can't help ya.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.208
- Magnus,

02:14.208 --> 02:16.000
you know where I am.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.708
- Declan, I'm serious,

02:18.708 --> 02:21.292
the men I know here told me
if I ever returned,

02:21.292 --> 02:23.292
they'd break my back,
stuff me in a sack,

02:23.292 --> 02:25.083
drop me
to the bottom of the loch.

02:25.083 --> 02:28.042
- I need to get to her,
I need to get to him.

02:28.042 --> 02:31.083
You never told me what
happened to you here, but right
now, I need you to help me.

02:31.542 --> 02:35.292
- Uh, forgive me for overhearing
every word of this,

02:35.292 --> 02:38.375
but in my experience -
which is very much -

02:38.375 --> 02:41.417
going home
is never as bad as one think.

02:41.417 --> 02:43.500
I am sure we can talk
to your friends

02:43.500 --> 02:45.375
and bring out from them
the help we need.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.083
After all,

02:48.375 --> 02:52.000
we are doing this
for the love of a woman.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.542
Ah!

02:56.833 --> 02:58.708
- We're gonna have to go
north.

02:58.708 --> 03:01.500
And this is going to end badly.
- Just get me there.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.083
- Well, hang on!

03:03.083 --> 03:05.167
Shouldn't we make sure
that Benton is even here first?

03:05.167 --> 03:06.333
(high-pitched voice):
Gna-gna-gna.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.000
Shut up.
Just stay on the ship.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.750
Te Rangi, see if you can find
someone to mend those sails
right here, quick.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.167
Tell 'em where we're going.

03:17.292 --> 03:20.375
(theme music)

04:20.500 --> 04:22.958
- You bring violence
of the white men to my people,

04:22.958 --> 04:25.000
spilling blood on our hands!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.292
- It was in defence of
our lives. Please, forgive me.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.667
- It is not I
you should ask forgiveness of.

04:32.583 --> 04:35.750
I trust you'll be
accompanying his body
back to Fort James.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.417
- We can't go back
to Fort James.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.292
- We must respect his death.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.542
-<i> Okimaw. </i>May we please speak
in private?

04:50.542 --> 04:52.958
- You think I am so naive
as to believe

04:52.958 --> 04:55.958
trading with you
will be any different than HBC?

04:55.958 --> 04:57.583
- It will be different.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.250
Imagine a fort
where all can live

04:59.250 --> 05:02.500
without the constant fear of
the HBC striking down on us.

05:02.500 --> 05:07.125
- Our story of creation
reminds us of humility.

05:08.042 --> 05:12.583
It was Muskrat that brought
that mud up
from the depths of the water

05:12.583 --> 05:15.208
to create Turtle Island.

05:15.208 --> 05:18.958
Not the bear, or the eagle,
or the beaver.

05:20.083 --> 05:22.917
We're only as strong as
our most vulnerable.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.708
- We are vulnerable, Kamenna.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.667
All of us.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.000
You know the company is
partnering with the Iroquois,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.125
your enemies.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.750
- Yeah, I know.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.917
- Then you know your days of
peaceful trade are numbered.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.292
Once they start encroaching
on your territory.

05:42.292 --> 05:44.667
- Yeah, I can't argue with you
on that.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.125
- Do we have our deal?

05:48.792 --> 05:53.333
- If you fell the HBC,
it will not be through
a river of blood.

05:58.167 --> 05:59.500
- You have my word.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.417
(in Cree):
<i> - The officers are coming.</i>

06:04.000 --> 06:05.667
- Cock walloping
jumping fuck!

06:05.667 --> 06:06.625
Michael!

06:09.833 --> 06:12.542
(chatter)
We've got company,
troops on the move.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.083
Let's move this bastard.
Move those!

06:20.958 --> 06:22.917
(Vanstone):
A soldier named Vinnicombe
was coming here.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.250
- Let's go.
(Vanstone): Have you seen him?

06:25.250 --> 06:27.208
- Go ahead, Malcolm. Godspeed.
- Michael...

06:28.375 --> 06:31.792
If you show your face
out there, those pricks
will peel it off you.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.792
- I'm not gonna let Kamenna
deal with this any longer.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.583
- I'll deal with this,
but you go.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.375
Go.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.250
- I'll burn this camp!
Take those furs,

06:44.250 --> 06:45.917
and any others you find.

06:46.292 --> 06:48.083
It'll save us a trip later.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.250
- You're looking for
Michael Smyth, eh?

06:52.417 --> 06:54.292
I might know something about
where he's to.

06:54.292 --> 06:56.625
- Where is he, Brown?
- Oh, well...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.250
He's not here.

07:01.042 --> 07:02.042
- What the?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.917
Major Vinnicombe is dead.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.500
Collect his corpse.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.625
Arrest this prick.
- Yes, sir.

07:25.042 --> 07:27.083
(soft music)

08:13.542 --> 08:15.125
(bird crying)

08:23.125 --> 08:24.083
- Grace?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.083
Look at me, please.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.833
Let me see your lovely face.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.458
You're tall.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.167
Like your mother was.

08:40.208 --> 08:43.750
- You left Fort James for
Montreal, and never returned.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.083
I got word you were dead.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.792
- I had to leave, Grace.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.917
No time for goodbyes.

08:55.917 --> 08:58.208
You don't understand how--
- No, I understand.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.458
I understand that the only thing
ever to light a fire

09:02.458 --> 09:04.375
under your arse
was the promise of silver...

09:05.208 --> 09:07.083
or the threat of
getting your hands cut off.

09:07.958 --> 09:10.125
Surprised to see
you still have them,
to be honest.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.125
- Luckier if I didn't, eh?

09:13.125 --> 09:16.042
They would have a job
to shackle me then.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.083
- From the state of you,

09:20.083 --> 09:21.875
it would seem
you came to this prison
from another.

09:22.458 --> 09:25.708
- Must give you some happiness.
Hm?

09:26.792 --> 09:30.417
See your useless old man
get his comeuppance for...

09:30.417 --> 09:32.250
for all the pain I've caused.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.833
I'm sure you've dreamed of
this day.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.083
- Don't flatter yourself,
Edward.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.000
You never made it
into my dreams.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.125
- Honestly, Mr. Pond,
I don't think it's necessary
for you to go

09:47.125 --> 09:49.167
rushing out
into the wilds like this.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.917
The Browns already think us
murderous.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.833
If you need their cooperation,
you should consider
the best course of action.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.333
And-and Michael is...

09:57.333 --> 10:00.167
a necessary evil
if you want that
Lake Walker trade.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.500
- Why are you giving me advice
on business?

10:03.375 --> 10:04.667
You did your job.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.625
Why don't you wait
in the parlour...

10:09.625 --> 10:11.750
aging cruelly
until I return?

10:14.833 --> 10:19.375
- If I pay Douglas Brown
another visit, I'm sure I--
- Stop!

10:21.500 --> 10:24.125
Is this all an excuse
for you to see
Douglas Brown again?

10:24.125 --> 10:29.333
- Why would I want to see
that boorish bookworm?

10:30.208 --> 10:31.875
He's depressing to be around.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.958
- Every girl loves
a little sadness.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.708
- Look, you're gonna be fine.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.083
I'll give Mary her due,

10:44.083 --> 10:45.750
she knows how to concoct
her herbs,

10:45.750 --> 10:49.792
and you'll feel poorly, yes,
but you won't die, I promise.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.375
- Where is Mary?

10:52.958 --> 10:56.042
- She's not here.
- Where is she, Imogen?
- I don't know.

10:56.042 --> 10:58.792
- I'd expect a woman like you
to know
when the numbers are off.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.750
- This is a business,
not an orphanage.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.542
And that girl's got
a mind of her own,

11:02.542 --> 11:04.250
and I'm hardly her keeper.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.542
- But you have no problem
with keeping other women,
do you?

11:09.333 --> 11:11.250
Buying our women.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.292
- I don't have to go looking.

11:17.292 --> 11:20.500
My girls come to me
with silver in their eyes
and lots of love to give.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.250
- Is that what O'Reilly
convinces them they're doing

11:23.250 --> 11:24.958
before he sells them to you?

11:25.792 --> 11:28.917
- The only thing I buy
from Mr. O'Reilly is
the occasional brace of hare.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.542
- Mary was to meet me
and she did not.
I want to know where she is.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.000
- Probably off somewhere
praying to God

11:44.000 --> 11:46.125
she don't go to hell
for working here.
(chuckling)

11:46.958 --> 11:50.667
- I will wait.
- I would prefer if you didn't.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.458
- Bring me some of
your terrible food.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.583
- You know you should
reconsider.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.958
Spirited girls like yourself
fetch a good purse working here.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.208
- I will show you
what spirited looks like.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.875
- And you'll see the end of
my musket if you dare to try.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.083
I'll fetch you your soup.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.875
- Hold on, hold on.

12:34.292 --> 12:35.875
Just wait a minute.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.750
If they're actually in here,

12:37.750 --> 12:41.792
your best chance would be
to shoot the fat ginger one
in the puss,

12:41.792 --> 12:43.500
that'll slow him down
at least. Good luck.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.000
(background chatter)

12:55.833 --> 12:56.958
(grunting)

12:59.333 --> 13:01.167
- Welcome home, Maggie.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.292
- Well, at least we know
we have come
to the right place, huh?

13:05.292 --> 13:07.667
(indistinct chatter)

13:13.667 --> 13:14.833
- You stay here.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.500
I don't think it'll be safe
for you where I'm going.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.167
- Well, what am I supposed
to do?

13:19.167 --> 13:21.750
- Don't wander off.
- Oi!

13:22.625 --> 13:24.167
When are you coming back?

13:47.375 --> 13:49.292
- Who the fuck are you lot,

13:50.417 --> 13:51.958
and what are you doing
in my establishment

13:51.958 --> 13:55.417
with this wee rodent-balled
shite bag?

13:56.167 --> 13:59.667
- It's very interesting for you
to have asked, Mister...?

13:59.667 --> 14:01.125
- His name is Barclay.

14:02.583 --> 14:03.917
And I'm Angus.

14:05.167 --> 14:10.000
- These men killed the Redcoats,
then press us into service
in the name of the King.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.500
So you see, uh,
they are no friends
to the Crown.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.125
Seems that none of us are.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.000
- Fuck off.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.125
Or you could stay.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.792
See what we do to cowards.
(agitated chatter)

14:35.250 --> 14:39.792
(moaning)
- Now that was a nice wee kip.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.042
- What would make a man do
something so reckless,

14:43.042 --> 14:45.667
as to follow this wee prick

14:45.667 --> 14:49.667
into the one place on Earth
where he is least welcome?

14:50.792 --> 14:51.917
- I need your help.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.708
- Why the fuck
should I help you?

14:58.417 --> 14:59.375
- Hope.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.250
- Hope?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.833
- Before it forsakes you
for good.

15:06.167 --> 15:08.000
Look at this place.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.833
A sad little sarcophagus
for desperate shrinking cowards.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.000
- Oh, you should stop.

15:20.042 --> 15:23.292
- Oppression from others
is what we all have in common.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.708
Is it not better to fight
for your homes, your land,

15:27.417 --> 15:28.583
your self-respect,

15:28.583 --> 15:32.708
<i>mana, </i>that was stolen from you?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.292
Will the red blanket
keep you warm

15:35.292 --> 15:39.875
when you are thrown out
into the cold
as food for their dogs?

15:41.083 --> 15:42.792
Or you can join us.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.333
Help us.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.750
Help this man raise his hand
against those who have taken
what is not theirs to take.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.333
- What was taken from you?

15:56.292 --> 15:57.708
- He took everything.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.542
- Looks like
we've all lost something.

16:12.417 --> 16:14.917
I think drinking's
the best way to find out

16:14.917 --> 16:18.833
what a man is really all about.
- What does that mean exactly?

16:18.833 --> 16:20.167
- He likes to drink.

16:20.167 --> 16:22.458
He likes to find new friends
to drink with.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.583
Just mind your head.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.542
- There's just one rule--

16:25.542 --> 16:26.708
- Oh!

16:27.208 --> 16:28.958
(Declan grunting)
- Keep up.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.250
- You're dead.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.292
- You left me
to fend for myself.

16:55.292 --> 16:57.000
- And you thrived!

16:57.458 --> 17:00.458
You showed as much mettle
as any man could.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.292
And I got you the ale house,
so that--

17:02.292 --> 17:04.000
(scoffing): You got
the ale house for yourself

17:04.000 --> 17:06.333
so you could drink your
life away when the war was over.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.250
- You learned how to be tough.

17:08.250 --> 17:12.708
You learned to be strong.
My-my failings became
your successes.

17:15.333 --> 17:19.167
I don't know how
my wrongdoings have now
landed you here, but--

17:19.167 --> 17:20.333
- This isn't about you.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.875
This has everything to do
with me, because His Lordship
wants something from me.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.042
- Does he now?

17:32.792 --> 17:35.583
- He thinks he can use you
to get me to do what he wants.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.542
- Whatever it is, will you--

17:40.542 --> 17:43.333
- Well, it's a complicated
matter of integrity, Da.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.500
I wouldn't expect you
to have a useful opinion.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.333
- What happens
if you refuse him?

17:51.333 --> 17:52.708
- Well, then, you die.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.542
- I loved you, in my own way.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.792
Taught you as I saw fit.

18:08.292 --> 18:10.708
Where is your compassion
for a...

18:11.583 --> 18:13.750
for a lonely, cursed man,

18:14.042 --> 18:16.667
a man forced to be
both father and mother

18:16.667 --> 18:19.167
to a such a willful--
-<i> I </i>lack compassion!

18:20.208 --> 18:21.875
You will never,

18:21.875 --> 18:24.583
never know the danger
you put me in.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.167
Father.

18:27.042 --> 18:28.375
Every day.

18:29.417 --> 18:32.667
What your lack of your kindness
left me vulnerable to:

18:34.208 --> 18:37.375
the wilderness, the cold,
the violence, the blood.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.500
The men.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.500
It was your job

18:43.500 --> 18:45.250
to keep me safe.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.167
To love me,

18:47.167 --> 18:48.917
to foster me,
to feed me,

18:48.917 --> 18:50.667
but you abandoned me instead.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.667
And now, you demand
my compassion!

19:05.667 --> 19:07.542
- You are right to abandon me.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.917
If I am to die here...

19:15.375 --> 19:16.542
so be it.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.792
But I will not die
without your forgiveness, Grace.

19:29.292 --> 19:33.250
Do not damn me
to the eternal like this...

19:35.917 --> 19:39.083
in pain for your love.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.042
(sobbing)

19:45.917 --> 19:47.042
Forgive me.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.125
Forgive me, please.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.417
(sniffling)

19:55.000 --> 19:59.375
(Benton): I had very different
expectations
for our relationship.

20:00.542 --> 20:01.500
Hm.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.792
But believe me,
I do understand.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.583
After spending years

20:06.583 --> 20:08.375
surrounded by men on a ship,

20:08.375 --> 20:12.542
I'm sure you were
very easily manipulated
by Ms. Emberly.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.625
- She's a nice lady.
- She is.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.125
Very nice lady.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.458
And you were starved
of female companionship.

20:21.542 --> 20:24.583
You chose to help Ms. Emberly,

20:25.750 --> 20:28.375
at the expense of helping me.

20:30.833 --> 20:35.500
So now,
her fate is in your hands.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.500
- Um, what's that supposed
to mean?

20:39.292 --> 20:42.000
- Unless you help bring
Declan Harp to me,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.833
Grace Emberly will meet
a very tragic end.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.542
- Well, I don't know
what you're talking about, see,

20:49.917 --> 20:51.125
I don't know anything
about her.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.625
- Oh, please.

20:53.292 --> 20:55.292
I've long since abandoned
the notion

20:55.292 --> 20:58.208
that there is such a thing
as coincidence.

20:59.833 --> 21:02.708
Don't try my patience, girl.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.167
You are on very thin ice
as it is.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.333
- I don't have to bring Harp
here.

21:11.042 --> 21:12.667
He's on his way to see ya.

21:16.458 --> 21:19.167
- Then you will tell me
everything he's planning

21:19.167 --> 21:22.083
and you will say nothing to him
in return.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.625
(soft classical music)

22:09.625 --> 22:10.750
- LeBlanc!

22:10.750 --> 22:12.375
Can you come in here?

22:18.875 --> 22:21.583
Get me a bottle
of fine champagne.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.333
(twig snapping)

22:37.792 --> 22:39.458
(suspenseful music)

22:54.792 --> 22:55.833
- O'Reilly!

22:59.083 --> 23:00.708
Aren't you a sight?

23:00.708 --> 23:02.667
- I could say the same thing
about you.

23:11.292 --> 23:14.125
- I got the trade deal with
Kamenna and the Lake Walkers.

23:14.583 --> 23:15.917
Exclusive!

23:15.917 --> 23:17.792
If there was ever
a time to build, it's now.

23:17.792 --> 23:20.208
But one of our partners is
locked up.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.792
Malcolm gave himself up
to save me.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.542
I can't just leave him
with Vanstone.

23:23.542 --> 23:24.958
- You're a good man, Michael.

23:25.458 --> 23:26.417
Loyal.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.000
That Vanstone,

23:30.042 --> 23:31.917
only one he's loyal to
is himself.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.167
- O'Reilly,

23:35.750 --> 23:37.500
I'm gonna need your help
getting Malcolm out.

23:40.875 --> 23:41.833
- I...

23:42.583 --> 23:44.125
I can give you a hand
with that.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.917
- My father's destiny
is in your hands, not mine.
- Not so.

23:55.375 --> 23:58.208
It's up to you
whether he lives or dies.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.500
Did I not make myself clear?

24:00.500 --> 24:04.083
- What is you seek from me
that you would go
to such lengths?

24:04.083 --> 24:07.458
- I wish you to speak
to Lord Fisher on my behalf.

24:07.458 --> 24:09.917
- The Chairman of
the Board of Directors?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.375
And say what?

24:12.375 --> 24:14.875
- Whatever I desire you to say.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.875
- So my testimony will be
the thing to redeem you.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.667
You wish me to secure
your reputation

24:23.667 --> 24:25.750
so you can regain
the power you lost.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.625
- Such a clever girl!

24:32.167 --> 24:33.792
- The answer is no.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.917
- Then your father will die.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.625
- I think you'd be putting him
out of his misery, to be honest.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.708
- Captain, do your worst.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.375
I have to say,

24:47.375 --> 24:50.083
you are full of surprises,
Grace.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.417
(Edward): No.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.625
No! Grace!

24:54.500 --> 24:56.458
I want to speak
to his Lordship!

24:56.458 --> 24:59.375
Grace! Forgive me!
Ah! Ah!

24:59.375 --> 25:00.500
- Stop!

25:00.500 --> 25:01.750
(screaming)

25:02.208 --> 25:03.542
Stop him.
- I will,

25:03.542 --> 25:06.458
if we have an agreement.
- Grace! Forgive me!

25:06.458 --> 25:07.833
- Let him go.

25:08.542 --> 25:11.583
A full pardon
and release from prison
and I'll do what you ask.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.000
- Captain Winton, stand down.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.542
I knew you'd come around.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.792
(background chatter, laughter)

25:39.917 --> 25:42.833
- Good day, sir.
- Madam.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.417
Where is the, um, patron?

25:51.417 --> 25:53.042
- Who?

25:53.042 --> 25:54.583
- The proprietress.
The, um...

25:55.667 --> 25:57.833
That auburn-haired seraph.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.042
- Oh, Grace Emberly.
- Hm.

26:00.042 --> 26:01.125
- No, she's gone.

26:01.708 --> 26:02.833
I'm in charge now.

26:06.083 --> 26:09.083
Can I get you... an ale?
Some food?

26:10.083 --> 26:11.167
Fresh rabbit stew today.

26:11.167 --> 26:13.125
- Doesn't that sound delicious.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.833
Do you have any rooms for let?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.250
- I do.
- Hm.

26:18.625 --> 26:21.625
- Rates depend on the woman
and for how long
you want to be entertained.

26:21.625 --> 26:25.000
- There is nothing I like more
than a little debauchery.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.792
Sadly, I am here
in the pursuit of business.
- Ah.

26:29.375 --> 26:31.125
- I might be staying
for a while.

26:31.125 --> 26:32.792
Your handsomest suite, please.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.750
(coins jingling)

26:35.042 --> 26:36.125
- Yes, sir.

26:38.708 --> 26:39.667
- Ahem.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.208
- My valet told me
you were here.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.375
- Your valet?

26:48.167 --> 26:50.125
I hope you do not mind me
calling.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.458
- Not at all.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.333
But it doesn't seem
quite normal

26:54.333 --> 26:56.792
for you to simply stroll
by Grant's place.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.792
Unless you've come
with a purpose?

26:59.833 --> 27:00.917
- No purpose.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.250
Other than, I-I suppose...

27:04.208 --> 27:05.458
to see you.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.417
- To see me?

27:07.417 --> 27:08.750
Is that so?

27:09.583 --> 27:10.750
- Why...

27:12.042 --> 27:14.708
I thought that
Grant and Pond having left,

27:14.708 --> 27:17.833
you here all to your own,
you may... ahem...

27:18.208 --> 27:20.708
...perhaps enjoy
a dinner guest.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.208
- You suggest we dine here?

27:23.208 --> 27:26.833
- I'd invite you to my house,
but Josephette might read
too much into it.

27:26.833 --> 27:30.917
- Oh, well, anything
to interrupt the boredom.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.750
I mean...

27:33.750 --> 27:36.875
I mean yes.
Dinner would be lovely.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.500
- Good.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.208
- Push me one more time,

27:54.208 --> 27:56.375
you're gonna lose
that fucking hand, mate.
- Oh yeah?

28:00.792 --> 28:02.250
Steady, boys!

28:03.000 --> 28:04.458
Major Vinnicombe

28:04.458 --> 28:08.708
has met his end.
But I've arrested his murderer!

28:08.708 --> 28:09.958
And tomorrow,

28:10.667 --> 28:12.875
we'll string him up
as an example.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.417
Oh!

28:15.333 --> 28:18.458
(grunting):
Put him in the fucking tent!

28:18.458 --> 28:20.500
- Yes, sir.
- And he is my catch.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.708
I want it known
that I caught him,

28:22.708 --> 28:26.417
I'll try him, and I alone
will decide his sentence.

28:26.417 --> 28:29.583
- You cannot decide
when to take a shite
for yourself, mate.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.750
(exclamations, grunting)

28:31.958 --> 28:33.250
- Go!
- Yes, sir.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.083
Come on you.
- You'll pay for that, mate.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.167
- Get in the fucking tent.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.208
- Vanstone.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.708
What's all the noise about?

28:49.458 --> 28:51.625
(chatter in camp)

29:00.667 --> 29:02.583
- O'Reilly, haven't seen you
in a while.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.458
Looks like you got
a good haul of pelts.

29:05.167 --> 29:07.083
- I see you're not doing too bad
yourself there.

29:07.542 --> 29:12.333
- Ah, that's not fur, that's
Major Vinnicombe's corpse.
(gasping)

29:13.250 --> 29:14.708
- Rest in peace.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.292
What happened?
- I caught one of the bastards
who did it.

29:18.292 --> 29:21.583
A Scot. He's an ally of
the Black Wolf Company!

29:21.583 --> 29:23.042
- Well done.
- Yeah.

29:23.042 --> 29:25.125
I got him roped up
in the tent now.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.375
I'll try him in the morning,

29:27.375 --> 29:29.833
and I fully intend
to find him guilty.

29:29.833 --> 29:31.708
- Oh, as you should,
aye, as you should.
- Well,

29:31.708 --> 29:34.375
someone's got to take charge of
Fort James.

29:34.667 --> 29:37.292
And what better way
to declare my authority

29:37.292 --> 29:39.292
than to hang a dissident?

29:52.208 --> 29:55.625
(in Cree):
<i> - What is your name?</i>

29:57.417 --> 29:58.625
- Pardon me?

29:59.167 --> 30:02.083
(in Cree):
<i> - Are you with the man</i>
<i> who trades women?</i>

30:02.417 --> 30:06.208
- I don't speak Cree.
I'm Haudenosaunee.

30:06.875 --> 30:08.333
- What is your name?

30:08.333 --> 30:09.917
- I am Kahwihta,

30:09.917 --> 30:13.167
wife of Mr. O'Reilly.
- Where is he?

30:14.083 --> 30:16.375
- Who are you?
- Sokanon.

30:16.958 --> 30:18.208
Is he here with you now?

30:18.208 --> 30:19.583
- What do you want?

30:19.583 --> 30:20.792
- I want your help.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.708
To stop these men
and what they do.

30:28.833 --> 30:31.625
- It was not my choice
to marry him.

30:31.625 --> 30:33.417
- Were you sold to O'Reilly?

30:33.417 --> 30:36.583
- Religious men<i> gave </i>me to him.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.208
Mr. O'Reilly works with them

30:39.208 --> 30:41.542
to find wives
for the working men.

30:42.375 --> 30:45.542
My family was tricked by
the Godly men into believing

30:45.542 --> 30:48.583
my marriage would secure
trade relations.

30:48.583 --> 30:52.208
That I would benefit us all
by learning the ways of
a new god.

30:54.292 --> 30:56.833
- I promise you,
I will put an end to this.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.292
And I will free the women,
like you, who have been taken.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.625
- But you can't undo
what is done.

31:02.292 --> 31:06.667
How will<i> you </i>reunite them
with their mothers
and sisters again?

31:07.208 --> 31:08.750
- Protect yourself, sister.

31:09.667 --> 31:14.708
Women of the People,
like you and I, are not safe
around some of these men.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.500
Tell me where he is.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.625
- He's at the tent.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.750
- You should have
a couple of ale, my friend.
On me.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.083
Celebrate your victory.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.792
(Vanstone):
You are absolutely right.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.958
Herman,

31:41.958 --> 31:44.125
stay on your post.
- Yeah, and maybe,

31:44.125 --> 31:46.583
uh, you might have some coin
left over...

31:46.583 --> 31:47.833
to get a woman.

31:52.042 --> 31:55.792
- I can't help but notice
you remind me of
a neighbour I had back home.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.542
Now, he was awful brute.
(grunting)

32:00.542 --> 32:01.958
(grunting)

32:01.958 --> 32:03.792
(Malcolm chuckling)

32:03.792 --> 32:05.875
- I never thought I'd see
the likes of you again,
Michael Smyth.

32:05.875 --> 32:08.792
- Yeah, well,
we're in this together now.
(grunting)

32:13.167 --> 32:14.625
- Good work.
- It's a pleasure.

32:18.375 --> 32:19.333
- Pond?

32:20.208 --> 32:21.500
- This is cozy.

32:23.125 --> 32:25.667
Why am I not surprised
to find the two of you
together?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.083
- It's your turn again.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.000
(Declan groaning)

32:39.417 --> 32:41.125
- Okay.
(burping)

32:41.750 --> 32:42.917
Stop moving.

32:45.542 --> 32:46.500
(grunting)

32:46.875 --> 32:48.375
(loud exclamations)

32:48.375 --> 32:49.750
(McTaggart):
Oh, you baldy bastard.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.042
(Declan grunting)
(Barclay): Ah!

32:57.708 --> 32:59.542
(Barclay burping)
(loud exclamations)

33:01.458 --> 33:02.458
(retching)

33:06.958 --> 33:08.875
(vomiting loudly)

33:11.500 --> 33:14.208
(background chatter)
- Oh!

33:17.833 --> 33:18.792
- Don't worry about it.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.958
I've never seen anyone -
other than myself -

33:23.667 --> 33:26.125
drink anywhere near as much as
you did.

33:26.125 --> 33:30.000
- I was just warmin' up.
Let's do it real for this time.
Come on.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.083
- Nah, it's done.

33:35.125 --> 33:36.708
I'll help you get your lassie.

33:40.000 --> 33:40.958
- You will?

33:42.708 --> 33:44.042
But I lost.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.000
- Everyone loses, big man.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.750
But if you're willing to go
that hard...

33:50.250 --> 33:51.375
we'll help.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.708
- Thanks, Barman.

33:56.125 --> 33:58.083
(drunken mumbling)

33:58.083 --> 34:00.875
- I was here in the marketplace
earlier, and I overheard
this housekeeper

34:00.875 --> 34:03.875
buying some stuff for a castle
just outside the village.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.500
Now, she was bragging about
some Lord who'd been away
for a long time,

34:07.500 --> 34:08.792
and he'd just come home.

34:08.792 --> 34:11.708
So, I come in closer
and I overheard

34:11.708 --> 34:15.542
that this Lord she was going on
about, is Benton.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.250
- What did this lady look like?

34:20.458 --> 34:23.625
- Well, sh-she was about
my height, I dunno really.

34:24.292 --> 34:25.583
She was wearing a hat.

34:26.167 --> 34:27.958
Anyway, you left me alone
for so long,

34:27.958 --> 34:29.375
I nicked some food.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.333
Hungry?

34:30.625 --> 34:31.750
(Declan): Food!

34:31.750 --> 34:33.625
- What?
What's happened to you?

34:36.542 --> 34:40.250
- I punched a
big fat ginger pig...
in the face.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.167
Then, I puked.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.000
But I won.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.542
- Aye, he sort of won.
Meaning we have help.

34:48.542 --> 34:50.458
But he's a fucking mess,
as you can see.

34:50.458 --> 34:54.792
- No, come on, we got to find
Bemberly, I mean Emberly.
Emby. Grace.

34:54.792 --> 34:57.917
Come on, let's go.
- I think that
an even better idea

34:57.917 --> 35:01.000
would be to do it
in the morning.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.917
This can help
to drop our chance...

35:05.333 --> 35:09.708
of bringing people
who hear a big, drunk man,
and come to kill us.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.875
- Nope. Nope. Let's go.
Come on, Chief.

35:12.875 --> 35:14.875
I don't understand
what he said, let's leave.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.375
I don't understand Portuguese.
Come on!

35:19.833 --> 35:21.125
- Aye, come on.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.500
- "To Lord Fisher,

35:24.583 --> 35:28.167
I am writing to you as you are
the head of the great
Hudson's Bay Company,

35:28.167 --> 35:32.458
and the person who would be
most in need of the following
information:

35:33.208 --> 35:37.500
I am Governess of Fort James,
wife to Jonathan Chesterfield.

35:38.208 --> 35:40.417
It is my greatest regret
to inform you

35:40.417 --> 35:43.333
that my husband has committed
treason against the Company,

35:43.875 --> 35:46.167
and therefore the King himself."

35:46.667 --> 35:50.708
- "He has betrayed
his British honour,

35:51.583 --> 35:57.500
and neglected his sworn duty
as both Governor

35:58.000 --> 36:01.583
and a member of
the Royal British Army.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.958
He has taken great pains to...

36:07.625 --> 36:11.125
corrupt the good name of
Lord Benton."

36:11.125 --> 36:12.625
No, no, wait.

36:13.667 --> 36:16.375
"The most loyal Lord Benton."

36:17.042 --> 36:22.375
"The only obstacle to
Chesterfield's nefarious goals

36:23.667 --> 36:26.208
and traitorous ambition...

36:27.208 --> 36:29.792
to rule the New World."

36:34.042 --> 36:38.917
- You seem to, uh,
fit in quite well,
to your new environment.

36:38.917 --> 36:41.833
- Hm, I think I was born
to be rich.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.792
- Hm.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.500
How long do you intend
on living here,

36:46.500 --> 36:49.375
with Pond and Grant
hovering over you?

36:49.667 --> 36:51.750
- I hadn't really
thought about it.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.583
- I'd be concerned.

36:54.833 --> 36:57.583
Things may change abruptly
upon their return.

36:59.458 --> 37:03.375
- Mr. Grant has made
many a magistrate wealthy,

37:03.375 --> 37:07.375
which is how he and Mr. Pond
escape trial.

37:07.375 --> 37:08.625
- Mr. Pond...

37:09.542 --> 37:11.250
is a dangerous man.

37:11.917 --> 37:13.583
I have seen myself
what he can do.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.708
- He may be strange,
but he's not dangerous.

37:16.708 --> 37:20.417
- I suppose you've never seen
him kill a man in cold blood

37:20.417 --> 37:22.250
before your very eyes.

37:25.208 --> 37:27.417
- Grant is the dangerous one.

37:28.208 --> 37:32.083
- How so?
- He's the worst kind of
dangerous there is.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.958
He's powerful, immoral
and frightfully insecure.

37:36.958 --> 37:38.833
- I know it in my veins,

37:39.792 --> 37:42.792
he's responsible
for the death of my wife.

37:43.542 --> 37:45.625
I simply need to prove it.

37:46.583 --> 37:49.208
- It's a terrible thing
to lose someone close to you.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.792
My brother died.

37:54.958 --> 37:58.500
In England.
He was killed by a soldier.

37:59.542 --> 38:01.542
It was Michael's fault.

38:02.875 --> 38:08.208
- It seems Michael is
more of a plague on you
than Grant is on me.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.625
- Are you concerned for me?

38:17.708 --> 38:20.792
- I suppose you could...
call it that.

38:26.458 --> 38:30.167
Ah, now you've seen
how clumsy I can be.

38:30.167 --> 38:31.250
- Oh, my God.

38:32.583 --> 38:34.000
It's ruined!

38:34.542 --> 38:36.333
- It's just a wee bit of wine.

38:36.833 --> 38:39.292
- No! He's going to lose
his mind.

38:40.042 --> 38:41.500
- Alright. Uh...

38:42.917 --> 38:44.500
Stop it. Look at me.
Look at me.

38:47.292 --> 38:50.000
It's alright,
I can do it.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.042
Up we go.

38:53.042 --> 38:54.000
Come on.

39:07.417 --> 39:09.542
- Okay, Vanstone,
he's no Benton,

39:09.542 --> 39:11.125
or even Chesterfield.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.875
He's a dull-head, but
he can still be dangerous to us.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.833
- Yeah. And his men,
they don't trust him.

39:14.833 --> 39:17.333
- If we can knock Vanstone
down a few pegs
and run the Redcoats out,

39:17.333 --> 39:20.458
we might actually have a chance
of taking charge of Fort James.
All of it.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.583
- A deal with the Lake Walkers
and no one to compete with,

39:22.583 --> 39:25.042
and the HBC will abandon
this place come spring.

39:25.042 --> 39:27.167
- They will if they feel
the force of all our men.

39:27.167 --> 39:29.917
- Great. So now, can we
get out of here before
the firing squad comes?

39:29.917 --> 39:32.542
'Cause I'm happy with
the number of holes I've got.

39:34.792 --> 39:38.875
- Sorry to keep you so late.
- That's no bother.

39:38.875 --> 39:42.542
I'm sorry we have to lay off
the remaining workers.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.125
- Hopefully Malcolm Brown
will come through.

39:44.125 --> 39:47.750
- If Malcolm fails,
then all is lost.

39:47.750 --> 39:52.042
Have you considered that
it may be wise to think about
alternative plans?

39:52.042 --> 39:56.125
There is another Brown brother
with whom you must contend.

40:00.708 --> 40:05.167
- Michael is a thief.
But he's-he's not a liar,
if that makes sense?

40:06.625 --> 40:08.250
- Not really.
(chuckling)

40:09.167 --> 40:11.708
- Well, he-he's cunning,
he's clever.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.167
Charming.

40:13.167 --> 40:14.917
But he is loyal.

40:14.917 --> 40:17.875
You just...
have to be on his side.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.250
- Yet, you say he's...
responsible for the death of
your brother?

40:25.125 --> 40:27.208
I, too, lost a brother

40:27.208 --> 40:30.792
at the hands of a soldier.
- I'm sorry.

40:32.292 --> 40:34.250
- May I ask you something?

40:34.917 --> 40:37.083
- I can't promise I'll answer.

40:39.375 --> 40:43.500
- This household
is not a safe place for you.

40:44.500 --> 40:49.958
If you're ever in danger,
come to me. Do not hesitate.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.792
- That's not a question.

40:59.125 --> 41:02.083
If only people knew
the real man
inside Douglas Brown,

41:02.792 --> 41:05.917
he'd be the most sought-after
bachelor in Montreal.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.958
It's... it's late.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.708
- Why, yes, it's late. Uh...

41:43.667 --> 41:46.042
I've overstayed my welcome.

41:46.042 --> 41:47.292
I'm sorry.

41:49.833 --> 41:50.792
Good night.

42:06.125 --> 42:08.208
- We let go
the last of the workers today.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.125
(Douglas sighing)

42:10.125 --> 42:13.542
- Well, once your furs arrive,
they'll be back to work
soon enough.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.833
- Yeah, that's<i> if </i>the furs
arrive.

42:15.833 --> 42:16.958
(chuckling)

42:16.958 --> 42:18.875
- I find it odd

42:18.875 --> 42:23.375
that you'd go behind my back
and conspire against me
with my brother,

42:23.375 --> 42:26.083
and yet, have so little faith
in him.

42:26.792 --> 42:28.375
- Malcolm is capable.

42:28.708 --> 42:31.708
But it is Michael Smyth
that we rely upon.
- Hm.

42:31.708 --> 42:35.750
- And it is imperative that
we do nothing to undermine
our arrangement with Michael.

42:35.750 --> 42:39.167
- Perhaps it's Michael Smyth
that's the one
who cannot be trusted.

42:48.042 --> 42:49.833
(background chatter, laughter)

42:52.958 --> 42:56.042
- Excuse me? Could I talk to you
for a moment?
- Okay. Easy.

42:56.042 --> 42:57.333
What can I do?

42:59.958 --> 43:01.917
What is this about?
- Well,

43:01.917 --> 43:04.125
nothing in, uh,
particular,

43:04.125 --> 43:05.750
it's just--
- Don't waste my time.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.125
- Well, it's not like
I'm paying you for it, I mean...

43:13.208 --> 43:14.667
- Are you crazy?

43:27.958 --> 43:30.708
- You will destroy no more lives
after tonight.
- Who-o-o-a!

43:30.708 --> 43:33.667
No, today I saved a life.
In fact,

43:33.667 --> 43:37.250
I saves lives every day.
- Is that what you call them,
you and your holy men?

43:37.250 --> 43:38.667
Taking our women.

43:38.667 --> 43:40.708
- Ha! Ha! Don't, don't,
do not be hasty, uh...

43:41.333 --> 43:43.625
It seems that we could help
each other. I mean...

43:43.625 --> 43:46.667
don't you think
it makes more sense for us
to work in tandem,

43:46.667 --> 43:49.417
rather than uh,
for us both to end up dead
on the Fort road?

43:49.417 --> 43:51.083
- Who else are you working
with?

43:51.083 --> 43:53.125
What business do you have
with Michael Smyth?

43:53.125 --> 43:55.208
- Oh, sure, she knows
Michael, me mate.

43:55.667 --> 43:57.083
You fancy him?

43:57.083 --> 43:58.375
You know, uh...

43:58.917 --> 44:00.958
I could make something happen
between you and he.
(chuckling)

44:00.958 --> 44:03.667
- You tell me the truth
about everything

44:03.958 --> 44:07.792
or I will open up your head
and look for it myself.
(woman): Sokanon!

44:09.583 --> 44:10.750
(overlapping grunting)
