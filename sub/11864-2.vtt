WEBVTT

00:05.755 --> 00:09.420
Everybody dies.
That's just the way it is.

00:09.551 --> 00:14.462
I'm told I'm not supposed to argue
or question or even try to understand.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.720
I'm told a lot these days.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.179
Ever since my life was snuffed out
by a toilet seat from a space station

00:21.312 --> 00:24.646
and I joined the undead
and became a grim reaper.

00:24.774 --> 00:28.060
This is Rube.
He's my boss. He's undead too.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.231
He gets the list:
who's to die when and where,

00:31.364 --> 00:34.318
which he passes on
to the rest of us grim reapers.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.784
- This is what we look like to the living.
- Holy shit!

00:37.912 --> 00:39.952
My name is George Lass.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.625
This was my home
and this was my family.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.584
Dad, my sister Reggie, and Mom.

00:47.714 --> 00:51.546
- They're having trouble coping. So am I.
- I want my life back!

00:51.676 --> 00:54.084
- ETD?
- Estimated Time of Death.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.427
The first one's never easy.

00:56.556 --> 01:00.423
She's just a little girl.
She can't die. It's cruel.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.640
You can't change fate.
You march over there and take her soul quick.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.141
- Wait!
- You can't go where she's going.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.195
- What is it?
- It's not for us to know.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

02:16.052 --> 02:18.590
My name is George Lass

02:18.722 --> 02:20.880
and I've been dead for seven days.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.930
OK. That's a little dramatic.
I'm actually undead.

02:25.061 --> 02:30.186
A modern-day grim reaper.
I can take the souls of people about to die.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.393
Fucking nightmare!

02:36.197 --> 02:39.032
But I can't open my front door.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.447
It would help to have a key,

02:41.578 --> 02:44.413
but when you're squatting
in some dead guy's apartment,

02:44.539 --> 02:47.112
you can't expect a mint on your pillow.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.251
Even with this
seemingly divine power that I have,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.919
I don't get paid a cent,

02:56.051 --> 02:59.799
I can't disappear or fly
or walk through walls...

03:00.388 --> 03:01.419
What a shit-hole.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.506
.. and I had to live in this guy's apartment
that was really messy.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.721
Kind of like his death.

03:17.364 --> 03:22.322
Every night I laid in bed
and went over the facts again and again.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.658
I think I lived a normal life.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.328
- Get up!
- Mom.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.782
Get out of bed and go to work.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.168
You will collect a paycheck
and move out of this house.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.503
And then I was killed.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.624
Aw, shit!

03:40.470 --> 03:45.346
I became a reaper,
lifting the souls I was told to take.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.893
It's fucking weird.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.637
It's not our job to drop the pianos
or the toilet seats.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.023
- Whose job is it?
- Gravelings.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.772
Sleep.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.360
Maybe next week I'll get used to it.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.663
Maybe next week it'll make more sense.

04:16.798 --> 04:21.423
Maybe next week I won't sleep
in the back of my parents' car.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.177
My name is George Lass.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.882
I died when I was 18 years old.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.480
I take souls for a living.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.902
And these are the days of my afterlife.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.625
Oh, good Christ! Who are you?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.913
I... live here.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.679
- Were you Brandon's girlfriend?
- Yes.

05:11.895 --> 05:16.307
Friends and family
usually want a piece of you after you die.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.644
After all, who you are
is what you left behind.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.023
Actually, that's mine.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.196
Oh.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.364
That and the, um... TV.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.953
We gave him that TV.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.748
Did you even know Brandon?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.627
A little bit.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.253
But not really though.

05:48.390 --> 05:52.055
I moved in the day we met.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.684
Was this before or after he died?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.690
Same day.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.068
Please don't take the TV.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.028
But for me,
it wasn't what I left behind...

06:14.082 --> 06:15.956
.. it was who.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.911
- Hello, Claire.
- Hi.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.003
Um...

06:20.130 --> 06:22.206
What is it, Claire?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.748
This is difficult for me.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.834
I mean, it's difficult
for me to be telling you this.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.555
- It's about your daughter, Reggie.
- What about her?

06:32.684 --> 06:39.565
I just think what you're doing
could be considered a form of... abuse.

06:41.776 --> 06:47.067
Why did you tell Claire
that I don't let you go to the bathroom?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.567
Did you tell anyone else
I don't let you go?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.822
Who?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.529
The Gibsons and the McMinns.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.161
And the Lees.

06:59.294 --> 07:03.671
Jesus, Reggie! I could be arrested!
Do you want me to go to jail?

07:03.798 --> 07:06.503
Why? Why would you tell them that?

07:06.634 --> 07:08.923
So they'd let me use their bathroom.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.295
What is wrong with our bathroom?

07:12.515 --> 07:14.638
Nothing.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.717
Reggie, you are freaking me out.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.989
Reapers don't get a free ride.
Roxy works for the city.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.658
- There's a minute left. Write the ticket.
- Let me do my job, man.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.454
Where do all the coins go?
It doesn't seem big enough.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.497
There's this network of
pressurised vacuum tubes under the sidewalk.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.413
The meters drop off their reservoir
every three or four hours,

07:46.549 --> 07:51.425
it sucks through the tubes and dumps
into the basement of the parking office.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.006
- Oh, my God. Really?
- You got shit for brains, man.

07:55.141 --> 07:59.554
I got the keys and these bad boys
hold more than you think.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.139
- Roxy, come on. Give him the ticket.
- Whoa! Wait!

08:03.274 --> 08:07.058
- Wait! I'm coming.
- Not fast enough.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.069
- I'm here.
- It's done, sir.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.569
- I got change. Look.
- It's done, sir.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.069
- Come on, I'm right here.
- It's done.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.038
Lady, you saw me coming over.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.118
You need to step off, sir.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.335
- Fucking robot.
- You don't know me.

08:26.464 --> 08:31.422
"Look at me. I'm so powerful.
I can write a ticket on the fancy sports car."

08:31.553 --> 08:34.636
So you can go home at night
to your fucking TV dinner

08:34.764 --> 08:37.135
and feel better about your lousy life.

08:37.267 --> 08:42.058
You wake up every morning
wondering what the world's gonna do for you,

08:42.188 --> 08:45.723
wondering who's gonna
bend over backwards and kiss your ass.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.773
Just thank God for another day
and leave it the fuck at that.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.729
- Take this ticket back.
- No.

08:53.867 --> 08:58.078
- Hey, my friend. Come on.
- I am not your friend, my friend!

08:58.204 --> 09:01.371
Cool it! Sir, I'll say this
as politely as possible.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.373
I will fuck you up.

09:06.629 --> 09:10.413
- Are you kidding me?
- You don't know me.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.218
- I'm gonna report you.
- You really don't know my boss.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.425
Have a nice day.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.060
What's with the piece?

09:24.189 --> 09:27.723
These things can just drag on and on.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.319
OK.

09:46.252 --> 09:50.665
People say the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.417
As if that makes
all the shitty things in life any sweeter.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.890
Death is equally mysterious...

09:59.933 --> 10:02.684
.. but there's no sugar-coating that turd.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.024
Be it divine intervention
or natural selection...

10:19.828 --> 10:22.449
.. everyone's got an appointment.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.622
You may not know the time
or the place...

10:29.170 --> 10:31.246
.. but we do.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.552
He was slumped over the table
with the vacuum cleaner.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.432
- I think he was having sex with it.
- Upright?

10:41.558 --> 10:44.475
- Slumped over.
- The vacuum cleaner.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.603
Oh. No, the other kind, with the hose.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.731
I need a vacuum cleaner,
but I want an upright.

10:50.859 --> 10:56.101
Our friends down at County General need
volunteers to help with appointment overflow.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.695
Any takers?

11:00.744 --> 11:02.950
- What do you get?
- What do you mean?

11:03.079 --> 11:07.326
- Why should I do it?
- How about a good deed for good deed's sake?

11:07.459 --> 11:10.460
- Yeah. How about that?
- No, seriously.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.585
- Do you get anything?
- You get a coupon, peanut, from me.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.254
That coupon is redeemable
for one favour.

11:17.385 --> 11:22.047
You don't have any coupons,
so you don't have any favours. See?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.424
Coupons don't pay my rent.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.430
I County-ed once. Everybody was sad.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.231
One lady was so upset,
she had a snot bubble.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.930
She got so mad when I told her.

11:33.068 --> 11:37.646
- I think I'd like to pass.
- All I can do is ask.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.078
I didn't get a Post-it.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.611
- You're riding shotgun.
- Beg pardon?

11:46.748 --> 11:51.991
George thinks it's her call whether people
live or die, so she needs a chaperone.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.836
Today, you're it.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.010
Couldn't we have taken a cab?

12:04.140 --> 12:06.810
Do you have money for a taxi?
I don't.

12:06.935 --> 12:11.015
- Aren't there any commuter buses?
- I don't see any.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.319
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.400
- Hi.
- Thank you so much for stopping.

12:26.538 --> 12:29.788
You ladies are gonna
catch your death of cold. Hop in.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.870
I don't mean to piss all over this, but...

12:33.003 --> 12:37.463
We're on the edge of nowhere with
ten miles to go and I'm wearing Blahniks.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.042
Do you know how many people died
for me to get these?

12:41.177 --> 12:44.178
- Uh, no.
- Five. Five people had to.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.057
That alone makes them special.

12:47.183 --> 12:52.344
I am really trying to respect you,
Toilet Seat, I am, but it's hard sometimes.

12:52.480 --> 12:57.391
I know we'll work it out.
We both just have to be a little more tolerant.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.813
In the meantime,
you should get in the goddamn car.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.001
There was a sweetness to Betty,

14:05.136 --> 14:08.054
an ease in which she got the job done.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.440
Say, are you one of them Garson boys?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.358
- I am.
- I know your daddy.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.862
- You know Daddy?
- Mm-hm. I sure do.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.566
- How's your momma?
- She's just fine.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.992
So nice of you to ask after her.

14:33.123 --> 14:37.500
Your beautiful mother used to make
the most darling quilts I ever saw.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.126
- Momma made quilts?
- Mm-hm. She named them too.

14:41.256 --> 14:45.716
One of them was "Autumn Leaves
in Moonlight" and one was "Serendipity".

14:47.637 --> 14:50.389
I can't believe my ears.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.054
- Can I take your picture?
- Hell, yeah.

14:54.185 --> 14:58.230
Betty liked being a reaper.
It was painless for her.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.471
Happy thoughts.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.933
And I hated her for that.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.566
I couldn't get past the killing part.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.950
It didn't matter if I could put a smile
on a dead man's lips...

15:18.126 --> 15:21.127
.. I still felt like an accomplice to murder.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.767
Maybe we should get out here.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.362
You don't want me to wait
until you get your next ride?

15:51.493 --> 15:53.201
You are the sweetest.

15:53.328 --> 15:58.784
I wonder if she wanted
to save him, or if she wanted to be bad.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.167
What would you be doing
if you hadn't picked us up?

16:02.295 --> 16:07.087
- I guess I'd be driving.
- Then that's what you should do.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.755
You have a wonderful evening.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.680
What a nice man.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.863
There was no signpost for me,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.995
at least not one that I wanted to follow.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.456
I was rudderless. I didn't belong.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.035
Was I the only bad person?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.378
Didn't anybody else wanna be bad?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.045
There's a ridiculous amount of gum under here.

16:50.176 --> 16:54.008
- Don't touch it. Wash your hands.
- It's gum.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.427
It's been in somebody's mouth
with germs.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.555
Germs are everywhere.
It's viruses you need to watch out about.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.604
- I think there are viruses on there too.
- No.

17:04.816 --> 17:08.980
Viruses need a biologically-active environment
to survive.

17:09.112 --> 17:14.355
Synthetic rubbers and artificial flavourings
are not biologically active.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.738
- That is sick.
- Isn't saliva biologically active?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.910
- Über-waffle?
- Thank you.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.580
And Das Mexi-Fest.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.749
You ordered Mexican food
in a German waffle house?

17:29.883 --> 17:33.667
It was on the menu.
It has all the flavours of the world.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.635
I used to think that soul food
meant it came from Korea.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.598
You know... Seoul is a city in Korea.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.985
- Excuse me. Do you have any crackers?
- You mean besides you?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.567
They come with the soup.
You want soup?

17:56.076 --> 18:00.453
- No, thank you.
- Get a job if you're hungry.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.369
- Do you like fries?
- Yeah.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.545
Thank you.

18:17.639 --> 18:22.301
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't do beans.
I got consistency problems.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.018
Lima beans, black beans, pinto beans,
I don't do that shit.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.848
I feel the same about custardy foods.
Custardy and lumpy.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.226
Tapioca's like hell to me.

18:32.362 --> 18:36.146
I can have yoghurt,
but it has to have cereal in it.

18:37.450 --> 18:42.326
I was undead and kicking,
but at a loss on how to live.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.741
And carving my own path
seemed like way too much work.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.098
How do you know it was her?

19:34.215 --> 19:38.593
- Well, I had an interesting day today.
- Oh?

19:38.720 --> 19:42.800
- Took the afternoon off and went shopping.
- Good for you.

19:42.932 --> 19:47.179
Went to three Home Depots
to buy toilet seats for Reggie's school.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.186
You'll never guess why.

19:50.357 --> 19:55.232
I only took one. Jason Murray
and Steven Schultz took all the rest.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.691
I called Jason Murray and Steven Schultz.
They said you're an effing liar.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.232
Don't let me catch you using that word.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.283
- She even got the one in the teacher's lounge.
- No, I didn't.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.952
Reggie! Go to your room.

20:14.214 --> 20:19.635
I got some referrals for a child psychologist.
I'll interview people on Monday.

20:19.761 --> 20:23.379
- She doesn't need therapy.
- She needs something.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.890
Life is like an assembly line.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.934
First you have the great idea,
the master plan.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.603
You make the prototype

20:34.734 --> 20:36.857
and you start mass producing.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.400
Billions and billions.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.698
They don't last forever. Nothing does.

20:44.744 --> 20:50.829
And it's your job to take 'em off the shelf.
You're helping to restock life, peanut.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.410
This pill
wasn't going down any easier.

20:57.632 --> 21:00.123
Two family packs of mini waffles.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.593
I know that if this
was supposed to last, it would.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.925
Don't let that be a bad thing
any more than it is.

21:07.058 --> 21:11.720
That's sage advice, but I think
it's stupid to put me in this position.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.097
I could have a nervous breakdown.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.233
I'm very prone to anxiety attacks.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.602
Big deal.

21:19.738 --> 21:23.237
I don't think
I'm supposed to be doing this.

21:23.366 --> 21:27.150
If somebody else were supposed
to be doing this, I'd be with them.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.537
But I don't know anything about anything!

21:30.665 --> 21:36.620
You think I do? Most of the time
I'm talking out of my ass. I don't know shit.

21:36.755 --> 21:40.289
When we're supposed
to know something, we'll know it.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.960
I lost my train of thought.
What was I saying? Yes.

21:44.095 --> 21:47.678
Be patient, for Christ's sake.
You're learning.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.642
Just smell some fucking roses already.

21:51.895 --> 21:55.845
I'll never understand
the instinct to miniaturise food.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.983
- Bite-size.
- That's not bite-size.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.399
I can't put this into my mouth.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.364
- You got a little doggy box?
- You got it.

22:04.491 --> 22:08.535
- Now my fingers are sticky.
- You ate three of them.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.407
You wanna get my wallet
out of my pocket? Please.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.948
Back pocket. Right.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.958
Thank you very much.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.091
You do the honours. Pick this up for me.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.799
I'm gonna get some air.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.392
Can I help you?

22:38.525 --> 22:42.902
- Say, aren't you one of them Roth boys?
- Yup.

22:43.029 --> 22:47.490
As I stood there
staring at the soon-to-be-dead man,

22:47.617 --> 22:52.908
I thought of him like a box of waffles
whose expiration date had come up.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.162
- Can I get my bill?
- Sure.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.625
I wonder
how Mr Waffle's gonna bite it?

22:58.753 --> 23:01.588
Then there were the monkeys
in the works.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.674
Monkey see...

23:18.064 --> 23:20.021
.. monkey do.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.139
Somebody call an ambulance.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.817
Urgh!

24:07.614 --> 24:10.187
- Hold still.
- Ow!

24:10.325 --> 24:12.650
- OK?
- You fucker!

24:15.413 --> 24:17.287
How are ya doing, dead guy?

24:17.415 --> 24:20.333
Reapers heal way too fast.

24:20.460 --> 24:25.288
I wanted to be damaged beyond repair.
Incapacitated.

24:25.423 --> 24:29.124
If I couldn't do it,
they couldn't make me do it.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.968
Could they?

24:31.096 --> 24:34.429
I mean,
maybe if death could take a holiday...

24:39.479 --> 24:43.643
That's not right. That's not right.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.273
Maybe I can quit.

24:52.742 --> 24:56.407
- Do you guys smell urinal cake?
- I smell strawberries.

24:56.538 --> 25:00.203
- Does it smell like strawberries?
- Strawberries and urine.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.951
- What happened to the sign?
- Fell down and killed somebody.

25:04.087 --> 25:06.708
- No shit? Who?
- Monty.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.754
- Who?
- Fellow with the miniature food at the counter.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.922
Oh, I don't know him.
Must have been new.

25:14.973 --> 25:18.757
- Is there a reason I'm still waiting here?
- No.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.645
Seven and two bits each.
That includes tip.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.534
That's for you.
Hold on, buddy. Here you go.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.666
I was a deserter.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.549
And there wasn't much he could do about it.

25:50.675 --> 25:54.044
I didn't sign anything,
didn't agree to anything

25:54.179 --> 25:57.215
and I sure as shit
didn't shake anyone's hand.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.926
Come on, George.
Open the fucking door.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.684
I took no responsibility...

26:07.901 --> 26:11.270
.. but that didn't stop him
trying to force it on me.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.691
I convinced myself if I didn't touch it,
I wasn't obligated.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.953
If I wasn't obligated,
I had no responsibility.

26:35.512 --> 26:39.426
But what happens if somebody
has an appointment with death...

26:40.892 --> 26:43.727
.. and death doesn't show up?

27:00.912 --> 27:03.533
Is there a reprieve?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.786
Does that somebody's name
go back in the hat?

27:29.816 --> 27:31.892
Or does death get penalised?

27:41.077 --> 27:44.493
Maybe someone was trying
to send me a message.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.700
Reggie?

27:50.837 --> 27:53.043
Reggie, open the door!

27:53.173 --> 27:55.842
Go away! I have diarrhoea.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.846
How's your tummy?
You want some more Pepto-Bismol?

28:11.232 --> 28:12.312
OK.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.195
Do I have to go to therapy?

28:21.910 --> 28:23.986
Not if you don't want to.

28:34.422 --> 28:36.498
Way to enable.

28:52.357 --> 28:57.648
You know, you can talk to us...
about stuff.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.527
If you want to.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.785
All right. Well...

29:09.666 --> 29:12.786
- Good night.
- Night.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.587
Don't think I've forgotten
about the toilet seats.

29:22.095 --> 29:26.045
It was like an alternate universe
where I didn't exist.

29:27.392 --> 29:30.559
There were no goatees
or gold lamé sashes.

29:32.063 --> 29:34.519
Just a hole where I used to be.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.519
And everyone was making sure
to step around it.

29:54.878 --> 29:58.294
I gotta pay rent? Fuck.

30:01.426 --> 30:05.127
Consciousness depends on
how much blood you got in your brain.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.007
- Does it?
- Yes.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.972
The more blood flow through your brain,
the better it works.

30:11.102 --> 30:17.306
How does a hole in your skull get more blood
to your brain? I thought it'd be the opposite.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.933
Yeah. I asked the same question.

30:20.070 --> 30:23.818
They gave me an answer.
I'm fairly certain it made sense.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.439
I just can't be bothered to remember it.

30:26.576 --> 30:30.656
OK. What does this have to do
with getting a day job?

30:30.789 --> 30:35.664
Stimulation. Monotony is the mind killer.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.960
You're not gonna get blood pumping
sitting behind a desk.

30:39.089 --> 30:43.834
- Stimulation don't pay my rent.
- Then learn to live off the wild.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.467
It all sounded very glamorous.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.885
But I had to consider the source.

30:56.981 --> 31:01.560
After all, he drilled a hole in his head
chasing a permanent high.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.905
Too bad. It got away from him.

31:14.124 --> 31:17.623
- How much do you need?
- 650 dollars.

31:17.752 --> 31:20.504
- It's a lot of money for a shit-hole.
- Yeah.

31:20.630 --> 31:24.580
- Have you spoken to Rube?
- No. Is he mad at me?

31:24.718 --> 31:28.667
You missed an appointment.
I can't imagine he's... tickled.

31:29.931 --> 31:33.680
All right. You can have this one if you carry it.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.140
My arms are already asleep.

31:37.272 --> 31:42.147
- Can't I just take one of these?
- You can take the lighter one...

31:47.907 --> 31:50.030
That fucking hurt!

31:53.204 --> 31:55.874
Rube wants to see you at the morgue.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.299
Hi.

32:09.220 --> 32:13.717
- We're looking for JP Davis.
- You're all relations?

32:14.768 --> 32:17.056
Yeah.

32:17.187 --> 32:22.429
As fate would have it,
JP Davis was gonna die with or without me.

32:23.485 --> 32:28.063
There was no forfeit
and his name didn't go back in the hat.

32:28.198 --> 32:32.492
- May we have a moment please?
- Oh, of course.

32:39.793 --> 32:44.918
- Well, you really fucked the dog, peanut.
- What?

32:45.048 --> 32:49.757
- "What?" You had an appointment.
- I didn't make an appointment.

32:49.886 --> 32:51.345
Beat her.

32:51.471 --> 32:55.303
It doesn't matter who made it.
You had an appointment.

32:56.935 --> 33:01.264
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...
mission accomplished.

33:01.398 --> 33:04.731
You're wrong.
That was me correcting you.

33:04.859 --> 33:09.652
- I'm confused.
- He's still in there, you silly bitch.

33:12.242 --> 33:15.445
God! Oh, God!

33:15.578 --> 33:18.200
God! Oh, God!

33:19.582 --> 33:21.456
No, please...

33:23.670 --> 33:25.164
Oh, God!

33:25.296 --> 33:29.246
Holy shit! Is he in pain?

33:29.384 --> 33:32.219
Physically? No. He's dead.

33:33.346 --> 33:37.474
But emotionally?
I imagine this is pretty traumatic.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.183
Holy shit!
Why didn't somebody do something?

33:41.312 --> 33:44.064
It's not somebody's job. It's yours.

33:44.190 --> 33:48.270
Oh, that's...
That's stupid. This isn't my fault.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.484
It's not my fault. It's not Roxy's fault.

33:53.616 --> 33:57.697
That's such bullshit.
This is life and death.

33:57.829 --> 34:01.613
- She's finally figuring that out.
- Fuck you!

34:01.750 --> 34:04.869
Life and death can be simple.
Just do as I say.

34:05.003 --> 34:07.672
Cop a feel before this guy unspools.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.355
Oh, God! Oh, God!

34:34.908 --> 34:37.612
Oh, God. Oh, God.

34:40.038 --> 34:42.908
Thank you. Thank you.

34:44.626 --> 34:47.117
Cause and effect, peanut.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.041
Butterfly wings. Ripples in the pond.

34:51.299 --> 34:52.958
However you wanna put it.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.925
What you do now matters.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.131
What you don't do matters.

35:00.850 --> 35:03.258
Now say you're sorry.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.690
I'm sorry.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.061
It wasn't my fault.

35:17.325 --> 35:21.405
This lovely lady is gonna show you
some very pretty lights.

35:21.538 --> 35:24.373
- You go on ahead.
- What kind of lights?

35:24.499 --> 35:26.788
He said pretty, didn't he?

35:30.463 --> 35:33.583
- I can't do this.
- Sure you can.

35:34.676 --> 35:38.092
- You have to.
- I don't have to do shit.

35:39.431 --> 35:45.303
Do you like spaghetti, George?
I like spaghetti. I like board games.

35:46.396 --> 35:50.857
I like grabbing a trifecta
with that long shot on top.

35:50.984 --> 35:54.234
That ozone smell
you get from air purifiers.

35:54.362 --> 35:59.439
And I like knowing the space
between my ears is immeasurable.

35:59.576 --> 36:03.027
Mahler's First, Bernstein conducting.

36:03.163 --> 36:05.369
Think about all the things you like

36:05.498 --> 36:08.748
and decide whether
they're worth sticking around for.

36:08.877 --> 36:11.913
If they are, you'll find a way to do this.

36:13.214 --> 36:16.168
- What if I don't?
- Then you go away.

36:17.052 --> 36:20.052
Then you don't get
to like anything any more.

36:33.068 --> 36:35.107
- Hello, Claire.
- Hi.

36:36.821 --> 36:41.530
I had another visit from your daughter
today and, uh... Well, um...

36:43.119 --> 36:44.827
She took something.

36:44.954 --> 36:48.786
Reggie!
Get your ass down here right now!

36:50.251 --> 36:54.795
Thanks, Claire. We'll get it back to you
as soon as we find it.

36:54.923 --> 36:59.798
OK. Any chance you might know
when that would be?

36:59.928 --> 37:02.633
- No.
- OK.

37:04.391 --> 37:07.178
I thought about all the things I liked

37:07.310 --> 37:09.979
and all the things I didn't like,

37:10.105 --> 37:15.347
and I realised you can like something
and not like it at the same time.

37:15.485 --> 37:19.649
Not like loving unconditionally.
That's an act of desperation.

37:20.949 --> 37:23.025
This was different.

37:27.872 --> 37:31.656
Like respecting somebody
for being a mess

37:31.793 --> 37:34.414
because you're a mess too.

37:55.400 --> 38:00.276
It was reassuring to finally find
someone else who wanted to be bad.

38:01.489 --> 38:06.484
And if was horrifying to know
it wasn't just what I do now that matters.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.452
Jesus Christ!

38:13.418 --> 38:16.834
It was what I did then.

38:18.381 --> 38:20.374
I wasn't done liking things.

38:21.801 --> 38:24.838
I wasn't done not liking things.

38:28.099 --> 38:30.306
I wasn't done.

38:30.435 --> 38:33.187
Mildred Hagen?

38:34.481 --> 38:39.273
- Hi. I'm Delores Herbig. As in...
- Her big brown eyes.

38:39.402 --> 38:42.902
Well, you must know a Herbig or two.

38:43.031 --> 38:47.360
Yeah. I know a... Barbara.
Barbara Herbig.

38:48.912 --> 38:51.581
I think she made quilts or something.

38:52.707 --> 38:55.079
How queer.

38:55.794 --> 38:57.703
Why don't you come with me?

38:59.005 --> 39:02.457
So I forged ahead.
I found a way.

39:04.094 --> 39:06.501
Can I call you Millie?

39:07.722 --> 39:10.094
Yeah. OK.
