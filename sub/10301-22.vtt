01:20.500 --> 01:22.456
<i>Oh, Lord...</i>

01:24.820 --> 01:27.129
<i>...if I ever meant anything to you...</i>

01:27.340 --> 01:31.856
<i>...please let me fall asleep
before she thinks of sex.</i>

01:35.060 --> 01:37.335
Al...

01:39.380 --> 01:41.848
You are a woman, aren't you?

01:44.140 --> 01:47.018
Peg, we just did it last month.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.456
A man can't just roll over
and do it again.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.220
We have to rest in between.

01:52.540 --> 01:56.374
<i>Al, you can't wear
that cool V-neck T-shirt...</i>

01:56.580 --> 02:03.133
...and those stained pyjama bottoms
and expect me not to want you.

02:04.740 --> 02:08.096
They do show off the merchandise,
don't they.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.250
Let's prepare ourselves.

02:29.860 --> 02:32.215
Oh, Al, you're...

02:32.420 --> 02:34.058
...done.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.255
Thanks again, honey.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.609
How you feeling, Peg?

02:50.820 --> 02:54.290
I'm surprised you could make it
down those stairs this morning.

02:55.420 --> 02:58.412
I know. I was pretty tired.

02:58.620 --> 03:02.499
I hope that buzzing
didn't keep you awake last night.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.013
Yeah, those damn bees.

03:10.620 --> 03:14.613
You know, one must have stung you,
too, because I heard you scream.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.216
You wanna do it again tonight?

03:19.420 --> 03:21.456
Oh, Peg, I think if we do it again
too soon...

03:21.660 --> 03:24.413
...it'll cheapen the experience.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.929
Bask in the afterglow, baby.

03:28.740 --> 03:32.176
Now, Peg, you're not glowing.
You don't have that...

03:32.380 --> 03:36.134
...I've-been-satisfied-by-Al-Bundy look
on your face.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.217
Maybe you should go
to your girlie doctor.

03:38.420 --> 03:41.457
They say you should get checked out
every 50 years or so.

03:41.940 --> 03:46.218
You know, put you up on the old rack,
check your belts and hoses.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.812
Honey, there is nothing wrong
with my belts and hoses.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.773
I just need to be taken out
and driven once in a while.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.891
Well, that can't be a shot at me.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.615
I'm Al "The Mailman" Bundy.
I deliver.

04:06.580 --> 04:11.893
Yes, Al, but mailmen are slow.
And they deliver every day.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.688
Yeah, but they don't always
have to go to the same house.

04:21.980 --> 04:24.494
But seriously, Peg,
I mean, you weren't satisfied?

04:25.140 --> 04:28.371
<i>Well, let's put it this way:
I used to call you "the minuteman. "</i>

04:28.580 --> 04:31.538
Now I long for those days.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.937
But, you know,
Marcie was very comforting.

04:34.140 --> 04:38.019
She said with you,
the sooner it's over, the better.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.492
You told her?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.179
Al, you...

04:43.380 --> 04:45.769
You wanna throw around
the football?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.456
There, are we done?

04:54.380 --> 04:56.530
I think she might have told him.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.089
Al, really, you shouldn't feel badly.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.768
The reason you're so inept
in the bedroom...

05:01.980 --> 05:04.096
...is because you've put
all of your energy...

05:04.300 --> 05:07.417
...into your magnificent shoe career.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.654
It's time someone spoke for Al.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.291
Guess I was wrong.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.333
Oh, Al's down.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.974
I guess my work is done.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.576
Well, let's leave
these two lovebirds alone.

05:25.780 --> 05:28.897
They may wanna have sex
for a second.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.289
Whoops, they're done.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.131
Oh, relax, Al.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.218
I'm sure she didn't tell anyone else.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.576
Hey, Bundy, do me a favour.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.010
Have sex with your wife 50 times.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.654
We're cooking an egg.

05:56.500 --> 06:01.494
Darly, why don't you use the time it
takes your son to get out of his dress?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.338
Hiya, boy. How you doing?

06:10.540 --> 06:14.579
<i>Well, let's just say you won't hear
my bitch complaining to her friends.</i>

06:16.420 --> 06:18.138
Good boy.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.734
Daddy, do you remember
my boyfriend T-Bone?

06:27.980 --> 06:30.699
No, but he sounds delicious.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.456
Oh, I'll tell him you said so.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.733
We were all down at the Harley shop,
and he got into a discussion...

06:37.940 --> 06:41.569
...about whether there should be a limit
to presidential campaign contributions.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.248
Which, of course,
led to a knife fight.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.568
And you should be proud to know
that when kids fight...

06:47.780 --> 06:50.817
...they say, " I'm gonna waste you
quicker than Al Bundy. "

06:53.700 --> 06:55.099
What really bothered me...

06:55.300 --> 06:57.655
...was that I didn't know
about this politics stuff.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.691
Daddy, they called me stupid.

06:59.940 --> 07:01.896
Am I stupid, Daddy?

07:03.180 --> 07:04.818
Pumpkin...

07:05.700 --> 07:07.770
Now, you see that tree out there?

07:08.260 --> 07:13.254
Now, that tree grows and breathes,
just like you.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.419
So, pumpkin, you're just as smart
as that tree.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.652
Oh, you have to say that
because you're my father.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.332
Hey, anybody on the street
would say that.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.768
But now, pumpkin...

07:35.980 --> 07:39.370
...if you want to impress
that psychopath that you're dating...

07:39.580 --> 07:41.536
<i>...here's what you should do:</i>

07:41.740 --> 07:43.935
Learn one thing really well.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.017
Just pick some topic
that comes up often...

07:46.220 --> 07:48.211
...among your friends
in conversation.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.018
So politics or condoms?

07:53.940 --> 07:56.295
Politics would be good.

07:56.620 --> 07:58.895
You can start by learning
about all the presidents.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.777
There's more than one?

08:03.100 --> 08:04.931
Indeed.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.177
So learn all about the presidents...

08:07.380 --> 08:10.690
...and you'll fool your friends into
thinking you know other things too.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.016
And you'll never have to impress
anybody again.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.730
Thanks. I'm gonna go learn
about the presidents...

08:15.940 --> 08:18.090
...quicker than Al Bundy.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.857
Hi, honey.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.373
You're gonna be so proud.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.094
At the supermarket I heard
that they have changed...

08:33.299 --> 08:35.336
...the 10-item-or-less express line...

08:35.539 --> 08:37.849
...to the Al Bundy line.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.934
Oh, honey, you look down.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.973
Well, I got you a little present.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.014
Aurora white...

08:50.300 --> 08:53.212
...and a nice burrito.

08:53.420 --> 08:56.890
Come on, Al, break them both open.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.173
No.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.893
My self-esteem, my sexuality...

09:02.100 --> 09:05.331
...my whole manhood
has been taken from me.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.897
I never want to go
to the bathroom again.

09:10.700 --> 09:15.728
Well, maybe we can finally get
that curl out of the wallpaper.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.774
And the birds will come back again.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.252
Oh, honey,
this is really bothering you.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.655
Well, I'm gonna fix it right now.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.612
Okay.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.379
Hello, Marcie.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.653
Al and I just had a major sex-o-rama.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.499
Yeah, Al Bundy.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.730
He was magnificent.

09:46.940 --> 09:49.932
Yes, Al Bundy.

09:50.140 --> 09:53.212
Well, Marcie, I- I don't have
the strength to speak any longer.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.092
But let's not tell anyone about this.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.097
Except the girls
at the beauty parlour...

09:57.300 --> 10:00.656
...because, you know,
we know we can trust them.

10:02.580 --> 10:05.014
Al's got that look in his eye again.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.979
Oh, no, Al.

10:07.220 --> 10:11.452
Please have mercy. I... I...

10:20.300 --> 10:24.009
Well, now you're a legend, baby.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.973
- Feel better?
- No.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.776
We know it's not true.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.659
Come on, honey, have a burrito.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.339
No.

10:34.820 --> 10:39.336
Oh, come on, Al. It's off a truck.

10:44.620 --> 10:47.657
- Well, maybe just one bite.
- Yeah.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.017
Maybe just one roll.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.656
Still hurting, though.

11:05.060 --> 11:07.972
Wanna share some of that with me?

11:26.100 --> 11:30.093
All right, honey. Now we are gonna
learn all about the presidents.

11:30.340 --> 11:35.130
As a visual aid, we are gonna use
xeroxed copies of Daddy's money-

11:36.220 --> 11:38.575
I have the originals.

11:38.780 --> 11:42.090
- with pictures of our greatest
dead presidents on them.

11:42.300 --> 11:46.054
Now, this is George Washington,
the father of our country.

11:47.060 --> 11:49.528
I thought that was James Brown.

11:51.220 --> 11:53.734
No, he's the Godfather of Soul.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.938
I thought that was Don Corleone.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.093
I think we've had enough
for one day.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.336
Well, I still thirst for knowledge.

12:03.540 --> 12:07.055
I'll go to the place that got me through
high school, the principal's house.

12:10.340 --> 12:14.618
His door always was opened
for troubled girls.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.288
Hey, Daddy, ask me
who's on the one-dollar bill.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.092
Who's on the one-dollar bill?

12:21.340 --> 12:22.978
George Jefferson.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.736
So it was George Washington
that was married to Weezy?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.570
Al, I was
at the beauty parlour today...

12:36.780 --> 12:39.578
...and your name
is on everyone's lips.

12:39.780 --> 12:42.738
Well, that and bonbon crumbs.

12:43.020 --> 12:44.851
Everyone thinks you're a stud.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.930
- But you don't.
- Sure, I do.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.539
You do?

12:49.780 --> 12:53.090
Okay, your relentless interrogation
has broken me.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.052
I don't.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.250
But either way, it doesn't matter.

12:58.460 --> 13:01.770
Because you're mine and I love you.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.329
Honey, I'm gonna go upstairs now
and take a shower.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.930
My new nozzle, Jeffrey, just came in.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.776
What happened to me?

13:25.980 --> 13:27.857
I used to be good.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.130
Everyone said I was good.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.535
And girls don't lie.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.656
Only women lie.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.251
Maybe I should ask
some of my ex-girlfriends.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.099
How desperate would I have to be
to have my ego boosted...

13:41.300 --> 13:44.610
...by girls I slept with
and never called again?

13:44.860 --> 13:47.852
Come on, Lois. So it's been 20 years
since I promised to call you.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.176
I'm calling you now.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.495
Now listen, this is a toll call
so let me get right to the point.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.931
Remember that night in the back seat
of my old Dodge?

13:58.140 --> 13:59.971
How was I?

14:00.380 --> 14:02.689
I knew it.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.411
"What kind of car am I driving now?"
I gotta go. Bye.

14:10.820 --> 14:14.256
Yeah, can I speak to Marilyn Fisher?

14:14.460 --> 14:17.133
Oh, she's Mrs. O'Brien now.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.089
You're the husband. I see.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.052
Well, could you do me a favour?

14:22.260 --> 14:26.378
Yeah. My name's Al Bundy.
Could you ask her if she meant it...

14:26.580 --> 14:29.811
...when she said she'd had them all,
but I was the best?

14:32.980 --> 14:35.494
Oh, she's breast-feeding.
Hey, that...

14:35.700 --> 14:38.260
That brings back memories.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.253
So I was great.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.371
The best!

14:46.860 --> 14:50.489
Oh, come on, now.
You're making me blush.

14:51.460 --> 14:54.611
Well, thank you,
Sister Mary Ignatius.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.971
I knew I was good.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.648
And if I was good once
I can be good again.

15:08.860 --> 15:12.489
I'll just get back in shape
and show Peg I still got it.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.690
Al, I'm gonna take a nap.

15:17.940 --> 15:20.329
Yeah, rest up, baby.

15:21.140 --> 15:24.450
And this time I may even kiss you.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.415
Well, son, this is where
it all happens.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.417
The Bundy gymnasium.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.612
And until recently,
the place I came to cry.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.375
But not today. Today we train.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.810
Do a little bench press.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.011
Do about 30 reps.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.051
Count for me, son.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.572
One.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.252
Take the weight, son.

16:06.580 --> 16:09.048
- What?
- Take the weight.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.495
- Got it?
- Yeah.

16:14.380 --> 16:15.938
Mommy!

16:16.180 --> 16:18.410
- Get it off me! Get it off me!
- Okay.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.851
I'm gonna- I'm gonna roll it, Dad.
I'm gonna roll it.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.535
Not that way!

16:25.580 --> 16:27.138
Other way.

16:27.340 --> 16:28.978
Mommy!

16:43.220 --> 16:45.097
How many was that?

16:46.740 --> 16:48.298
One, Dad.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.774
All right. Well...

16:49.980 --> 16:53.017
...that's enough weightlifting.
Don't wanna get too bulked up.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.376
Supple strength is what I need.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.332
- We'll go hit the heavy bag.
- All right.

16:57.540 --> 17:00.418
- I used to box in the Golden Gloves.
- Really, Dad?

17:00.660 --> 17:02.457
Son, don't you think
if I actually had...

17:02.660 --> 17:05.696
...I'd have told you about it
100,000 times by now?

17:07.900 --> 17:09.413
All right.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.417
You gonna be okay, Dad?

17:27.619 --> 17:29.497
Maybe.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.408
Well, I hope so, because...

17:31.620 --> 17:34.180
...it's a long way to get
a neighbour to give mouth-to-mouth.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.173
You know, son...

17:36.380 --> 17:38.371
...this has taught me
a valuable lesson.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.013
I'm plenty strong enough...

17:40.220 --> 17:42.051
...but it's endurance that I need.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.693
Come, boy!

17:43.900 --> 17:45.333
I'm going to run.

17:45.540 --> 17:49.579
I need motivation. Show me the picture
of Grandma in her string bikini, please.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.932
Come on, Dad. Come on.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.415
Just two more steps.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.972
Thanks for helping,
Mr. and Mrs. D'Arcy.

18:07.180 --> 18:10.377
We wouldn't have helped,
but he passed out on our lawn.

18:10.580 --> 18:15.290
And I would have left him for compost,
but the flies started gathering.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.849
It's our little squirrel friend, Zippy.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.770
Well, it doesn't look like Zippy.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.173
Well, you have to imagine him...

18:37.380 --> 18:40.497
...with blood, bones,
and internal organs.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.770
Squirrel killer.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.050
Get him, Zippy.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.179
Okay, come on. Marcie.

18:49.380 --> 18:52.656
Marcie, come on.
Come on, let's go, honey.

18:52.860 --> 18:56.409
I'll give Zippy a nice burial.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.814
Cheer up, Dad.
So you killed a squirrel.

19:10.020 --> 19:13.296
If it wasn't you it would have been
some cook at a Chinese restaurant.

19:14.860 --> 19:17.249
Oh, Daddy, I'm glad you're alone.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.018
Listen, I have great news.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.694
You found your underwear
in the park?

19:25.500 --> 19:29.334
No, but if I'm ever looking for it
I know you're wearing it.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.010
Anyway, Daddy,
your advice worked out.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.610
We were at the biker bar and everyone
started talking about what happens...

19:38.820 --> 19:42.176
...when no presidential candidate
has a clear majority of electoral votes.

19:42.380 --> 19:45.531
And I said that the last time
this happened was in 1824.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.698
The House decided the election
and John Quincy Adams won.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.575
Daddy, I wowed them.
Now everybody thinks I'm a genie.

19:55.140 --> 19:57.893
Oh, thank you, Daddy. Now I know
I can overcome any obstacle.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.738
I love you.

20:05.940 --> 20:07.817
Where you going, Dad?

20:08.780 --> 20:10.099
To the basement.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.298
You gonna cry, Dad?

20:13.260 --> 20:15.171
Yeah, I am.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.970
But then I'm going to train.

20:18.180 --> 20:21.695
Because if my little girl
can train herself to hold a thought...

20:23.260 --> 20:26.297
...I can train myself to hold my wife.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.813
Let's see what you got, punk.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.856
Oh, Al!

21:49.540 --> 21:52.498
Oh, Al!

21:54.580 --> 21:57.811
Oh, Al!

22:14.580 --> 22:18.414
And to all a good night.
