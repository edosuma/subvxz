00:35.626 --> 00:37.827
<i>Star light, star bright,</i>

00:37.860 --> 00:39.864
<i>wish I had a home tonight.</i>

00:39.897 --> 00:41.966
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

00:41.998 --> 00:44.601
<i>Please, God,
I need a rescue!</i>

00:44.635 --> 00:46.870
<i>It is so cold in here.</i>

00:46.903 --> 00:49.572
<i>I'm always right here,
Charlie.</i>

00:49.605 --> 00:50.974
<i>I'm always right here.</i>

01:04.321 --> 01:05.956
There's so many.

01:05.988 --> 01:09.058
Yeah, there's a lot of them
and they all need a home.

01:09.092 --> 01:10.995
Yeah.

01:12.929 --> 01:14.964
Oh, this one's cute.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.003
Hmm, I wish we could
find them all homes.

01:22.605 --> 01:24.007
<i>Oh, Michael!</i>

01:24.040 --> 01:25.608
<i>Bring him in here.</i>

01:25.641 --> 01:29.113
<i>I need a rescue
right about now.</i>

01:29.146 --> 01:32.817
<i>My time
is getting short here.</i>

01:34.884 --> 01:36.586
You know...

01:36.619 --> 01:38.154
I've got a really special
dog in the other room.

01:38.188 --> 01:39.590
I think you're really
going to like him.

01:39.622 --> 01:41.257
- You want to take a look?
- Yeah.

01:41.290 --> 01:42.759
Yeah, let's go,
come on. This way.

01:44.293 --> 01:46.596
<i>Charlie,
here's your rescue.</i>

01:46.629 --> 01:49.265
<i>Scoot out over now
and give Jimmy a high five.</i>

01:49.298 --> 01:51.735
- Jimmy, meet Charlie.
- Wow.

01:55.671 --> 01:59.009
This is the one.
He's so cute.

01:59.042 --> 02:02.313
Your "him" is actually
a "her", I think.

02:02.346 --> 02:03.847
Still named
Charlie, though.

02:03.879 --> 02:05.982
<i>He's all yours,
Charlie.</i>

02:06.015 --> 02:08.318
<i>He'll have a challenge or two
that I will need your help with,</i>

02:08.352 --> 02:10.854
<i>but you will be
warm tonight.</i>

02:10.886 --> 02:12.989
- <i>Thank you, God.</i>
- <i>My greatest pleasure.</i>

02:13.991 --> 02:15.959
Can I pick her up?

02:15.993 --> 02:17.261
Yeah, she's all yours.

02:22.231 --> 02:23.700
<i>Easy! Easy, guy!</i>

02:23.733 --> 02:25.969
Why don't you go
introduce Charlie

02:26.003 --> 02:28.037
to the rest
of your family, huh?

02:28.070 --> 02:30.675
- Yeah, of course.
- <i>Ah, he'll get the hang of it.</i>

05:04.994 --> 05:06.329
Mom, you should
have seen it.

05:06.362 --> 05:08.232
We won, and I scored
the last goal!

05:08.264 --> 05:09.398
It was awesome!

05:09.432 --> 05:11.902
That is great news, Jimmy!
Hey, Emily?

05:11.934 --> 05:14.036
Can I get a couple of hot
chocolates down here to celebrate?

05:14.069 --> 05:15.105
Of course!

05:15.138 --> 05:17.174
<i>Over here!</i>

05:17.206 --> 05:18.775
<i>Don't forget the cookie!</i>

05:18.809 --> 05:21.078
Don't worry, Charlie.
I won't forget about you.

05:23.547 --> 05:26.884
Mom, I'm so excited. I can't wait
for Dad to see our soccer team.

05:26.917 --> 05:29.119
You know, your dad is coming home
in January for good this time,

05:29.151 --> 05:31.788
and he's not going back
ever again.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.857
- Really?!
- Yes!

05:34.891 --> 05:36.960
You know, I played horrible
last time he was here.

05:36.992 --> 05:38.862
Wait until he sees
me play now.

05:38.895 --> 05:41.832
I know. And that's why I picked up
so many extra Christmas parties,

05:41.864 --> 05:43.400
so that we can get help
with the bills

05:43.432 --> 05:46.202
and spend quality time
with your dad when he returns.

05:46.235 --> 05:49.005
Awesome.

05:49.038 --> 05:50.439
Which reminds me,
I have four parties tonight,

05:50.473 --> 05:52.309
and the last party
I am serving,

05:52.341 --> 05:55.545
which means that I won't get
home until really late.

05:55.578 --> 05:58.314
So, can you get
yourself home, homework done,

05:58.348 --> 06:01.417
- dinner for you and Charlie?
- Sure, Mom.

06:01.451 --> 06:03.253
- Two hot chocolates to celebrate?
- Thank you.

06:03.285 --> 06:04.521
- Of course.
- Whoo!

06:04.554 --> 06:07.124
- To the winning goal.
- Yes.

06:07.157 --> 06:08.526
Congratulations.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.029
Delish. Listen, I've got
to get back to work.

06:12.062 --> 06:13.297
- Mm-hmm.
- Enjoy your hot chocolate.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.831
Get home safe and sound
with Charlie.

06:14.864 --> 06:16.465
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay, watch for the cars.

06:16.499 --> 06:18.335
- I will. Love you.
- Love you.

06:20.636 --> 06:23.540
And because of the incident
last week,

06:23.573 --> 06:26.844
I'm ordering the enforcement
of our leash law.

06:26.876 --> 06:30.913
We have been way too lax about
penalties for dogs without a leash,

06:30.946 --> 06:33.583
collar or tags
for way too long.

06:33.617 --> 06:36.153
We will have hundreds
of people downtown

06:36.186 --> 06:39.156
for our parade
and for Christmas shopping.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.090
So, we don't want anyone

06:41.124 --> 06:46.063
stepping into any "presents"
left by our furry friends.

06:46.095 --> 06:49.333
What is the penalty
for having no leash,

06:49.365 --> 06:51.300
and who is enforcing?

06:51.333 --> 06:53.937
Well, officers Vic
and Don here

06:53.970 --> 06:55.939
will be enforcing
the leash law.

06:55.972 --> 06:57.574
I guess things are going to be
different now, Charlie.

06:57.607 --> 07:01.345
The fine is $100
for the first offence.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.946
I guess our plans
have changed.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.650
Got to go to the pet store
before we get our Christmas tree.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.920
Every time after that,
we'll add another $100.

07:09.953 --> 07:12.054
It's going to be a killer for mom.

07:12.088 --> 07:14.258
We need to get out of here
before someone sees us.

07:14.290 --> 07:17.461
All fines have to be paid
before your pooch is picked up.

07:18.662 --> 07:20.564
Any other questions?

07:20.597 --> 07:22.867
Thank you, thank you.
Let's go.

07:30.607 --> 07:33.176
Hi, there, Jill's Cakes
and Bakes. Can I help you?

07:33.208 --> 07:37.146
Jill, it's for you.
It's John's commanding officer.

07:50.126 --> 07:51.161
Jill Frost.
Can I help you?

07:53.696 --> 07:55.064
Yes.

07:56.566 --> 07:57.534
Yes.

07:59.602 --> 08:00.604
I understand.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.677
Bring a pen and paper.

08:07.711 --> 08:09.513
1400 hours.

08:10.980 --> 08:12.415
Okay.

08:12.449 --> 08:16.720
Uh-huh, 57 Fairfield.
Yes, sir.

08:16.752 --> 08:19.989
I will be there
to pick him up.

08:20.023 --> 08:21.458
Yes, thank you.

08:24.093 --> 08:26.562
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

08:26.595 --> 08:29.632
John's coming home tomorrow!

08:29.665 --> 08:33.602
- That's great news, right?
- Yeah, I should be thrilled.

08:33.635 --> 08:36.539
But it's five weeks early.
Five weeks early.

08:36.573 --> 08:39.543
And I'm so overbooked,
I can't even think straight.

08:39.575 --> 08:42.578
Kate, Emily, can you take
over my calendar tomorrow?

08:42.611 --> 08:44.514
- Of course! Of course.
- Please.

08:44.546 --> 08:47.216
I've got to pick him up
at 2:00. I'm so sorry.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.386
- It's okay, we've got this.
- Don't worry about it.

08:53.423 --> 08:55.659
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.485
Hi, Will.
Thank you so much.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.501
Jill's Cakes and Bakes!

09:38.535 --> 09:40.136
Merry Christmas.

09:42.505 --> 09:44.508
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

09:49.679 --> 09:51.280
Hello, Pam.

09:51.314 --> 09:53.216
You'll never guess
where I'm off to.

09:53.248 --> 09:55.084
<i>Probably not.</i>

09:55.117 --> 09:57.487
I'm on my way to pick up John
at the airfield.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.290
<i>Why so early? I thought he
was coming home in January.</i>

10:01.324 --> 10:03.426
I know, it was supposed
to be in January,

10:03.459 --> 10:06.729
but there was an incident in the
barracks so they released him early.

10:06.762 --> 10:09.266
His gain, my pain.

10:09.299 --> 10:12.636
<i>I remember what it was like when
Ronnie came home from Afghanistan.</i>

10:12.669 --> 10:16.206
<i>He was barking orders
at Mom constantly.</i>

10:16.238 --> 10:18.441
<i>Still does it sometimes.</i>

10:18.474 --> 10:19.775
How is Ronnie doing anyway?

10:19.809 --> 10:22.279
Is he still there
with Mom at the house?

10:22.311 --> 10:24.480
<i>Yes, he's still there.</i>

10:24.514 --> 10:26.850
<i>He has good days
and bad days,</i>

10:26.882 --> 10:30.519
<i>but she says
he's turning the corner.</i>

10:30.553 --> 10:32.489
<i>Well, Hank said he saw
him down at the Moose Lodge,</i>

10:32.521 --> 10:34.190
<i>and at Veteran's Park.</i>

10:34.223 --> 10:36.193
<i>Oh, thank goodness
for Hank Wentworth.</i>

10:36.226 --> 10:39.862
<i>I see him riding around town
with Jimmy every once in awhile.</i>

10:39.896 --> 10:41.698
Hank has been
a godsend to both of us.

10:41.731 --> 10:44.201
I mean, he's been like
a grandfather to Jimmy,

10:44.233 --> 10:46.469
and he helps me with all the errands
that'd have fallen through the cracks

10:46.502 --> 10:49.205
- if he wasn't there.
- <i>I wish I could help more,</i>

10:49.238 --> 10:53.242
<i>but since Daddy died,
I have been overwhelmed</i>

10:53.275 --> 10:55.112
<i>helping Mom get Ronnie
back on his feet again.</i>

10:55.145 --> 10:57.247
You know, Jimmy
and Charlie love to visit.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.682
Maybe we'll have
them do that this week.

10:58.714 --> 11:02.184
<i>Of course! Mom would love
to see them.</i>

11:02.218 --> 11:04.554
<i>Charlie seems to brighten
Ronnie's mood when she visits.</i>

11:04.587 --> 11:06.823
I'm almost there.
I'm a bit nervous.

11:06.856 --> 11:10.559
Actually, I'm a lot nervous.
I mean, I'm excited to see him,

11:10.593 --> 11:12.596
I'm just worried that he'll
be disappointed, you know?

11:12.628 --> 11:15.131
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

11:15.165 --> 11:17.867
<i>What John needs most
is time to adjust.</i>

11:17.900 --> 11:19.736
<i>It'll be
wonderful for Jimmy</i>

11:19.769 --> 11:22.672
<i>to have his dad home
for Christmas after all.</i>

11:22.704 --> 11:25.175
Yeah, thanks, sis.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.844
It'll be a holiday to
remember, one way or the other.

11:58.274 --> 11:59.576
John!

12:13.488 --> 12:15.391
- Hi.
- Hi!

12:15.425 --> 12:17.527
Oh, my gosh!

12:19.862 --> 12:21.732
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you.

12:26.769 --> 12:29.873
So, how did you manage
to get home five weeks early?

12:31.473 --> 12:34.410
That's kind of a long
and unpleasant story.

12:36.279 --> 12:39.316
But it won't affect
my honorable discharge.

12:39.348 --> 12:41.751
Or my retirement benefits.

12:41.784 --> 12:43.653
That's a good thing,
right?

12:43.685 --> 12:45.622
Yeah, it's a good thing.

12:45.655 --> 12:48.692
Good. Let's get you home.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.859
Okay?

12:59.269 --> 13:00.737
Nice wheels.

13:00.770 --> 13:03.906
- Whose car did you borrow?
- It's mine.

13:03.939 --> 13:08.712
Well, ours. I've been doing pretty
good down at Jill's Cakes and Bakes.

13:08.745 --> 13:11.548
- Jimmy know I'm coming home?
- Nah.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.649
I thought
we'd surprise him.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.520
Also, I hate to be the
practical one in this moment,

13:17.553 --> 13:19.689
but did you ever get
your driver's license renewed?

13:19.722 --> 13:23.393
Nope. I thought I could
do it when I got home.

13:24.424 --> 13:26.662
It's not as easy
as it used to be.

13:26.695 --> 13:30.466
Things have changed since
you were last a civilian.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.902
Well, I like the new car.

13:32.934 --> 13:35.405
Can't wait to see
what else is new.

13:54.623 --> 13:56.925
So, this is
where we live now.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.594
Yes.

13:58.627 --> 14:00.562
I've been doing so good
down at the bakery,

14:00.596 --> 14:02.532
I was able to buy us
this fixer-upper.

14:05.535 --> 14:08.737
I see where I fit in already.

14:08.771 --> 14:11.841
Can you give it
a chance, John?

14:11.873 --> 14:15.511
Trust me, this is going to
be a Christmas to remember.

14:15.545 --> 14:17.814
You just have
to stay flexible.

14:17.847 --> 14:21.818
My husband's early homecoming is not
an acceptable excuse for my clients.

14:21.851 --> 14:24.087
They just want their
parties to be "buzz-worthy."

14:24.120 --> 14:26.489
I'm sure I can find some
things to do around the house.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.527
Where's my chair?

14:31.560 --> 14:32.862
Dad, you're really home?

14:34.030 --> 14:36.065
- Dad, you're home!
- Yeah!

14:36.098 --> 14:37.900
I missed you.

14:40.670 --> 14:43.640
I thought you weren't coming
home for another five weeks.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.008
Oh, you should
have seen yesterday!

14:45.040 --> 14:47.544
I scored the winning goal.
It was awesome.

14:47.577 --> 14:50.947
And Charlie here
has been helping me practice.

14:50.979 --> 14:53.449
So, this is
the famous Charlie?

14:53.482 --> 14:55.484
And my best friend.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.586
It's a poodle dog.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.723
She's actually
a Maltese Terrier.

14:59.756 --> 15:01.824
It's okay, Jimmy.
We'll get you a real dog.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.727
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

15:03.760 --> 15:06.463
It's okay, Dad.
I'm fine with Charlie.

15:06.496 --> 15:07.963
Well, I'm not.

15:07.997 --> 15:10.900
It's Christmastime.
We'll find her a new home.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.869
And then we'll get
you a German Shepherd,

15:12.901 --> 15:14.771
like the ones that saved
our bacon in Afghanistan.

15:14.804 --> 15:16.372
- Okay?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:16.405 --> 15:19.476
Why don't we just take
this up another time?

15:19.508 --> 15:22.978
What? It's just I wasn't expecting
a pit bull's snack for a dog.

15:23.011 --> 15:25.681
<i>And I'm not a snack of anyone!</i>

15:25.714 --> 15:27.850
<i>Give me a chance
there, Dad!</i>

15:27.883 --> 15:31.153
This is Jill.

15:31.186 --> 15:32.388
Come on, Charlie.

15:35.757 --> 15:37.826
Yes, ma'am.

15:37.859 --> 15:40.529
Charlie, I know
it's been hard.

15:40.563 --> 15:44.734
Dad, and now the mayor
attacking us from both sides.

15:44.766 --> 15:46.835
I shouldn't dare ask
for a collar now.

15:46.868 --> 15:51.107
Dad would just say, "Oh,
I guess we can't afford the dog!"

15:51.140 --> 15:54.744
What a homecoming.

15:54.776 --> 15:57.413
"Here I
come, and out goes the dog."

15:57.447 --> 16:01.484
No, we'll have to show him. You'll just
have to be on your best behavior, 'kay?

16:01.516 --> 16:04.020
Well, well, well.
Officer Don, what do we have here?

16:04.053 --> 16:06.423
Oh, it looks like
our first offender.

16:06.455 --> 16:08.457
I thought that rule
didn't apply until Monday.

16:08.491 --> 16:10.727
Well, that's where you'd be
wrong, little fella.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.128
I saw you two
in the crowd.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.762
If you'd stuck around
until the end,

16:13.795 --> 16:15.898
you'd know that our patrol
started right that minute.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.433
What's his name?

16:17.467 --> 16:19.602
Oh! Ah!

16:19.635 --> 16:21.069
It's not a him, it's a her,
and I will get a leash

16:21.102 --> 16:22.872
as soon as my mom
is done with work.

16:22.905 --> 16:25.775
That excuse is not gonna work
tonight, all right?

16:25.808 --> 16:28.477
That's our first collar,
and we're gonna need him.

16:28.511 --> 16:32.115
So, hand him over peacefully
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

16:32.147 --> 16:34.117
Officer, I need
another chance.

16:34.150 --> 16:35.885
My dad just got home
from Afghanistan,

16:35.918 --> 16:37.987
and he's still
getting used to the dog.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.924
I don't want to have to tell him that
he needs to bail her out of doggy jail.

16:40.957 --> 16:43.059
- <i>Doggie jail?!</i>
- What do you think, Officer Don?

16:43.092 --> 16:44.861
Do you think we can give
this one a day's grace?

16:44.894 --> 16:47.630
Not on your life!
If word gets out,

16:47.663 --> 16:50.233
then we'll be stuck
in dog catcher purgatory

16:50.266 --> 16:52.068
for the rest of our police
department career.

16:52.101 --> 16:55.572
Come on, Don! As far as excuses
go, that's a pretty good one.

16:55.604 --> 16:58.040
Hey, hey, you heard
what the mayor said.

16:58.074 --> 17:00.510
She said if we solve
this problem,

17:00.543 --> 17:03.679
we can get back in our patrol
car, no problem.

17:03.713 --> 17:04.946
<i>Let's go!</i>

17:06.146 --> 17:08.650
Hey! Come here!

17:13.888 --> 17:15.590
- Gotta run!
- <i>Good one!</i>

17:28.037 --> 17:29.506
John.

17:31.273 --> 17:33.575
Babe.

17:33.608 --> 17:35.744
Sorry. You fell asleep
on the couch.

17:36.913 --> 17:39.583
Come. Let's take you
upstairs.

18:06.908 --> 18:10.012
So, what do you think?

18:10.046 --> 18:12.048
I think
it's a bit big on you.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.982
No, not the shirt.

18:14.015 --> 18:17.286
I just wore it because it
made me feel close to you.

18:17.319 --> 18:19.588
But now
I don't have to...

18:21.057 --> 18:24.094
because you're here.

18:26.596 --> 18:27.931
I mean,
what do you think?

18:29.932 --> 18:31.934
It's better than a bunk
in the barracks.

18:33.603 --> 18:36.272
That good, huh?

18:36.305 --> 18:38.041
I just don't know
if I'm going to fit

18:38.073 --> 18:41.009
into this new life
that you've carved out for us.

18:41.042 --> 18:44.246
Well, I think you'll like it
if you just give it a chance.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.648
I mean, Etowah has
a bad apple or two,

18:46.682 --> 18:49.819
but not enough to spoil
the whole barrel.

18:52.855 --> 18:53.890
John?

18:55.290 --> 18:56.826
John, you asleep?

19:08.136 --> 19:09.905
Good night, dear heart.

19:15.277 --> 19:16.713
Hey, Mom.

19:16.745 --> 19:18.080
Hey, you have everything
you need for school?

19:18.114 --> 19:20.717
I do. Is it okay
if Charlie stays here?

19:20.750 --> 19:23.353
- Why is that?
- Well, there's a new leash law,

19:23.386 --> 19:25.355
and I don't want her to get
caught while I'm at school.

19:25.387 --> 19:27.022
All right,
I'll keep her inside.

19:27.056 --> 19:28.891
- Not to worry.
- Thank you.

19:28.924 --> 19:31.060
- You're welcome. I love you!
- I love you too.

19:34.730 --> 19:37.800
<i>I will work on Dad
while you are at school.</i>

19:41.870 --> 19:43.905
- <i>Found you!</i>
- Charlie, get off.

19:43.938 --> 19:46.041
Ugh.

19:46.075 --> 19:50.078
<i>Not so long ago this was
my side of the bed, you know.</i>

19:52.114 --> 19:53.415
Charlie.

19:53.448 --> 19:54.916
Charlie, get out of here.

19:54.950 --> 19:56.886
Hey, move.

19:59.254 --> 20:01.390
Silly dog.

20:06.261 --> 20:08.263
Honey, can you get
this mutt away from me?

20:08.297 --> 20:10.700
<i>I'm doing
my best here!</i>

20:10.732 --> 20:12.702
Charlie, go lay down.

20:14.302 --> 20:16.071
So, what's
on the agenda today?

20:16.105 --> 20:18.241
I have six parties
to prepare.

20:18.273 --> 20:20.275
Thank God for Kate,
Will and Emily

20:20.309 --> 20:23.011
who hold down the fort
at Jill's Cakes and Bakes.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.846
Well, I'll come with you
if you want.

20:24.879 --> 20:26.448
I ran
a 150 soldier company.

20:26.482 --> 20:28.785
I'm sure I can handle
a little catering outfit.

20:28.818 --> 20:30.286
Okay.

20:31.386 --> 20:32.388
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

20:40.361 --> 20:43.298
<i>Good morning, everyone!
This is John.</i>

20:43.331 --> 20:46.135
- He's here to help.
- Good morning. Welcome home.

20:46.167 --> 20:49.137
I'm Will. I manage the cafe
part of Jill's Cakes and Bakes.

20:49.171 --> 20:51.307
- Nice.
- Would you like a cup of coffee or tea?

20:51.339 --> 20:53.909
Coffee would be great.
Nice to meet you.

20:53.943 --> 20:55.877
You too.

20:55.911 --> 20:58.915
Oh, hi!
Hi, John!

20:58.947 --> 21:01.783
- Welcome home.
- Kate Libby.

21:01.817 --> 21:03.720
She's sort of our frosting
that keeps the cake together,

21:03.752 --> 21:06.121
- so to speak.
- Nice to meet you.

21:06.155 --> 21:08.491
Would somebody mind
grabbing the door for me?

21:08.523 --> 21:10.424
Sure.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.929
Thank you.

21:13.963 --> 21:15.030
- Good morning.
- Morning.

21:16.197 --> 21:17.099
Morning.

21:19.135 --> 21:21.971
So, what can I do?

21:22.003 --> 21:25.507
We're short on help with all
our special Christmas orders.

21:25.540 --> 21:27.510
Want to help take the orders
for those two ladies there?

21:27.542 --> 21:28.877
Yeah, I don't mind.

21:30.178 --> 21:32.081
- Can I hand you this?
- Yeah, I'll trade you.

21:34.450 --> 21:35.418
Thanks.

21:37.086 --> 21:38.453
What can I get you, ladies?

21:38.486 --> 21:41.790
I'll have a peach tea
and cinnamon toast.

21:41.823 --> 21:44.226
Make sure you push
the toast down twice.

21:46.162 --> 21:48.297
I'm a little jet-lagged.
I just got back from Afghanistan.

21:48.329 --> 21:50.098
You're not messing
with me, are you?

21:50.132 --> 21:52.869
Oh, no, not at all.
It's a real thing.

21:52.902 --> 21:56.105
If you push it down twice,
it gets hotter.

21:56.137 --> 21:59.141
Okay, good to know.
What can I get you, ma'am?

21:59.175 --> 22:03.078
Yes, um... Well,
I would like a pot of Earl Grey.

22:03.111 --> 22:06.114
Two eggs, poached.
Wheat toast, but no butter.

22:06.147 --> 22:10.453
Vegan sausage and a blueberry
muffin, warmed, split in half,

22:10.485 --> 22:12.120
and make sure
it's warm in the middle.

22:12.154 --> 22:14.857
Cream cheese on the side
and a glass of ice water.

22:14.889 --> 22:17.993
Actually, make that
water with no ice.

22:18.027 --> 22:20.363
You know, that was
a real complicated order.

22:20.396 --> 22:23.933
I'm just used to ordering
a red pack or a... blue pack.

22:23.965 --> 22:27.302
Um... I'm sure we have it.
I'll see what I can do.

22:32.241 --> 22:33.408
Here we go.

22:33.442 --> 22:35.811
I think you scared
that poor boy.

22:35.845 --> 22:37.012
I did not!

22:37.046 --> 22:38.815
I just ordered
what I always order.

22:38.848 --> 22:40.950
- Well, that's scary.
- Well, did you see him?

22:40.982 --> 22:42.350
There's something
wrong with his brain!

22:42.384 --> 22:43.586
What's wrong
with him is you!

22:43.618 --> 22:45.154
Oh, stop it!

22:45.186 --> 22:47.022
You embarrass me.

22:57.465 --> 22:59.269
<i>That's not good.</i>

23:00.402 --> 23:03.206
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

23:05.473 --> 23:06.408
Can I have my jacket?

23:37.239 --> 23:39.242
Hey, Charlie!

23:39.274 --> 23:41.276
Whatcha got going
on this morning, girl?

23:41.309 --> 23:42.578
You know this dog?

23:42.610 --> 23:45.113
- <i>Of course he does!</i>
- Sure do.

23:45.146 --> 23:47.049
<i>Hank and I are buddies.</i>

23:47.081 --> 23:48.851
You'd be John.

23:52.253 --> 23:53.488
Welcome home.

23:55.124 --> 23:59.863
I'm Hank.
Vietnam, '67-'68.

24:01.696 --> 24:06.068
Jill told me that you'd be
back for good in January.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.670
She is so happy about that.

24:08.703 --> 24:12.474
You know, she worked really,
really hard to give you a soft landing.

24:14.376 --> 24:16.045
I know she has.

24:20.115 --> 24:21.517
She's been great.

24:22.717 --> 24:25.253
I had a PTSD incident.

24:25.287 --> 24:26.989
They sent me home
five weeks early.

24:27.021 --> 24:29.191
They set you up
with anybody stateside?

24:29.223 --> 24:33.995
I have to see a shrink for six
weeks, and then we'll see.

24:34.029 --> 24:38.034
You know that the best antidote
for PTSD is a good dog.

24:38.067 --> 24:40.603
You got a great
little dog right here.

24:40.636 --> 24:43.039
<i>Please talk
some sense into him.</i>

24:43.071 --> 24:47.010
<i>He's a little high strung,
if you know what I mean.</i>

24:49.011 --> 24:50.312
Charlie, you gonna
come get a coffee?

24:50.346 --> 24:52.982
Come on.
Yeah, let's go.

24:53.014 --> 24:55.318
- Jill's Cakes and Bakes.
- <i>Kate!</i>

25:03.392 --> 25:05.061
<i>What happened?!</i>

25:05.094 --> 25:09.065
Nothing that a pound of
confectionary sugar won't fix.

25:09.098 --> 25:11.067
<i>We need a complete reorder
for Mrs. Buchanan.</i>

25:11.099 --> 25:12.968
Okay.

25:13.001 --> 25:16.271
One reorder coming up.

25:16.305 --> 25:18.474
How should I get that to you
and Mrs. Buchanan?

25:18.507 --> 25:21.010
Uh... Get in the car
and drive them over?

25:21.042 --> 25:23.578
You do realize what you're
asking of me, correct?

25:23.611 --> 25:27.315
I'm a Southerner, and we
Southerners do not drive in the snow

25:27.348 --> 25:31.052
unless it is
an extreme emergency!

25:31.086 --> 25:32.555
- <i>Oh, my battery is dying.</i>
- Jill? Hello?

25:32.588 --> 25:34.123
Jill? Hi.

25:34.155 --> 25:36.291
Did you hear
anything I said?

25:37.792 --> 25:39.494
<i>Thomas.</i>

25:42.431 --> 25:43.433
Judy.

25:45.701 --> 25:47.303
Jimmy?

25:47.336 --> 25:49.338
Jimmy, are you
okay, buddy?

25:50.806 --> 25:52.775
This is not
your usual mode.

25:52.808 --> 25:55.310
Why don't you and I have a
little visit after class today?

25:55.344 --> 25:57.179
We'll talk
about this score, okay?

25:57.212 --> 26:00.249
Yes, sir.
I'm really sorry.

26:02.818 --> 26:05.687
And Jane. Yeah.

26:22.136 --> 26:24.607
Jimmy, about this test score.

26:26.308 --> 26:27.309
You failed.

26:29.845 --> 26:33.382
The whole town knows
your dad is finally home,

26:33.415 --> 26:35.651
and I'm sure this is
a very exciting time for you.

26:35.684 --> 26:37.252
It's very overwhelming.

26:37.286 --> 26:39.655
I need to keep Charlie
away from my dad,

26:39.687 --> 26:42.223
and now there's
puppy police too.

26:42.257 --> 26:45.728
I can't help you with
Charlie and the puppy police,

26:45.761 --> 26:49.498
or your time welcoming
home your dad.

26:49.530 --> 26:52.534
But I can come up
with some extra credit

26:52.568 --> 26:54.837
to put your math grade
back on score.

26:54.869 --> 26:57.305
We'll come up with something.
How's that sound?

26:57.338 --> 26:59.308
- Sound good?
- Great.

26:59.340 --> 27:02.145
- Okay, have a great day.
- You too.

27:25.666 --> 27:28.503
So, why so glum,
my little chum?

27:28.537 --> 27:29.805
It's the jolly season.

27:29.838 --> 27:33.274
You should have
the world by the tail.

27:33.308 --> 27:35.778
I failed my first
math test in my life.

27:35.810 --> 27:37.612
I feel horrible.

27:37.646 --> 27:40.582
- Oh, well, um, did you study?
- Yeah.

27:40.616 --> 27:43.618
- Do the best that you could?
- I did the best I could.

27:43.652 --> 27:45.788
I just fell asleep
halfway through the test.

27:47.889 --> 27:51.459
You fell asleep
halfway through the test.

27:51.492 --> 27:54.664
Hmm. Not good.

27:55.864 --> 27:57.500
But still,
all this bad grade stuff

27:57.532 --> 27:59.400
is really going to throw a
wrench in my future plans.

27:59.434 --> 28:01.569
Well, you know, I wouldn't
throw in the towel

28:01.603 --> 28:04.140
on something like that
right away, my little friend.

28:06.742 --> 28:09.578
Well, this looks like
a nice little place

28:09.610 --> 28:11.780
to get an early Christmas
present for Charlie.

28:11.812 --> 28:13.648
- What do you think?
- Yes, it does.

28:13.682 --> 28:15.550
Yeah.
You're paying.

28:15.584 --> 28:18.187
Wait. I thought
you were paying.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.424
Well, me, I...

28:25.626 --> 28:28.530
We're not just dog catchers, Don.
We're police officers.

28:28.563 --> 28:32.567
We deserve respect and...
and dry... ness.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.669
Look, we just get this dog
situation under control,

28:34.703 --> 28:36.771
and we'll be back in
the cruiser in no time, okay?

28:36.805 --> 28:39.275
- How hard can it be?
- Not very difficult at all.

28:39.308 --> 28:40.709
Little tedious maybe.

28:40.742 --> 28:43.212
Well, it just depends
on the circumstances, right?

28:43.244 --> 28:45.380
I tell you what,
the only thing that matters

28:45.414 --> 28:46.781
is that we get
these little mutts,

28:46.815 --> 28:48.551
because they're our only ticket
back in the action.

28:48.584 --> 28:50.920
Yeah, you mutts!
These...

28:50.953 --> 28:52.320
There's one right now!

28:52.354 --> 28:54.456
I'm going to be dry!

28:54.489 --> 28:55.725
<i>Cheech, look out!</i>

28:56.992 --> 28:58.460
Yeah!

28:58.492 --> 29:00.195
- <i>Oh, Cheech!</i>
- Wait, Don.

29:00.229 --> 29:01.463
This is Mrs. Gonzalez' dog.

29:01.495 --> 29:02.897
We can't take it
to doggy jail.

29:02.931 --> 29:05.568
- She can't afford that.
- A dog's a dog, Vic.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.735
Well, but this one's...

29:08.270 --> 29:09.905
Ugh, I don't think...

29:11.005 --> 29:12.641
All right, Don.

29:14.643 --> 29:15.845
Come on, buddy.

29:16.877 --> 29:18.646
I can't do it, Don!

29:18.680 --> 29:21.283
Vic, get the dog.

29:21.316 --> 29:23.919
Okay, I want to be dry.
I want to be dry.

29:23.952 --> 29:25.688
- Good.
- Okay, come on, buddy.

29:25.721 --> 29:26.923
We're gonna go.

29:30.358 --> 29:32.994
Oh, wow,
you're home early.

29:33.028 --> 29:34.797
Yeah, Hank
gave me a ride home,

29:34.829 --> 29:37.299
and we got a little
present for Charlie.

29:37.331 --> 29:38.434
Where is she?

29:38.466 --> 29:40.703
Well, it's funny
you should ask.

29:40.735 --> 29:44.540
Two officers came by the house
today looking for Charlie too.

29:44.572 --> 29:47.942
Said that she'd been seen walking
around town without a leash.

29:47.975 --> 29:50.345
Oh, at least
we have one now.

29:50.378 --> 29:52.481
Okay, good.
Because I thought

29:52.513 --> 29:55.717
you were going to get that German
Shepherd sooner than I thought.

29:55.751 --> 29:59.622
<i>Here we go with
the German Shepherd again!</i>

29:59.655 --> 30:00.990
Did you check the back porch?
That's where she goes

30:01.022 --> 30:02.724
when she knows
she's being hunted.

30:02.758 --> 30:05.394
No, I'm only joking.
She did come back, and I let her in,

30:05.426 --> 30:06.761
but then she hid somewhere.

30:06.794 --> 30:09.297
<i>I'm under here.</i>

30:09.330 --> 30:10.866
But what I don't
understand is,

30:10.898 --> 30:14.270
if she knows not to go out
in the first place,

30:14.302 --> 30:16.771
but she knows where to go
when she's chased,

30:16.805 --> 30:18.874
then why is she
not smart enough

30:18.906 --> 30:20.643
not just to go out
in the beginning?

30:22.610 --> 30:23.911
Charlie!

30:23.944 --> 30:25.748
It's because she makes
her rounds.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.715
She visits
all the neighbors.

30:27.749 --> 30:30.752
Mrs. Wagner gives her
treats in the morning.

30:30.786 --> 30:33.522
As far as I know, Charlie is the
only one that visits Mrs. Wagner,

30:33.555 --> 30:35.991
except when I'm
on my paper route.

30:36.023 --> 30:38.426
Yeah, it's not
exactly rounds.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.928
Listen, I'm hungry.
You want a sandwich?

30:39.961 --> 30:41.463
- <i>My favorite!</i>
- Of course.

30:41.495 --> 30:42.397
Come on.

30:46.702 --> 30:48.737
Did you tell Gram
you're home?

30:48.770 --> 30:51.906
She still thinks
I'm coming home in January.

30:51.940 --> 30:54.743
Haven't had the heart to tell
her that things got off-kilter

30:54.776 --> 30:56.812
and they sent me
home five weeks early.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.419
But I'm glad to be home.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.887
You glad to see me?

31:05.921 --> 31:08.657
Of course I am!

31:08.690 --> 31:12.361
The last time I saw you,
you were playing with cars and trucks.

31:13.794 --> 31:15.363
I'm in junior high now, Dad.

31:15.396 --> 31:17.832
It's all about sports
and videogames.

31:20.635 --> 31:21.837
What time does
your mom get home?

31:21.869 --> 31:23.338
Whenever she's
done with work,

31:23.371 --> 31:26.341
but that just gets later
and later this season.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.910
How 'bout when I'm done
with homework,

31:27.943 --> 31:30.011
we can go pick her up
for some dinner?

31:30.044 --> 31:32.580
Yeah. That's a good idea.

31:33.882 --> 31:35.084
Yeah, eat up.

31:38.653 --> 31:40.522
Mmm.

31:48.797 --> 31:52.000
Local on North
or Mama Ernesta's?

31:52.032 --> 31:54.770
<i>Local on North! They give me
treats on the porch!</i>

31:54.802 --> 31:56.871
Mama Ernesta's
spaghetti.

31:56.905 --> 31:58.973
- Ah, I love that place.
- Okay.

32:12.521 --> 32:15.691
What?!
John!

32:15.723 --> 32:17.525
Jimmy, be careful!

32:20.561 --> 32:21.829
Jimmy!

32:21.863 --> 32:23.065
Jimmy, get her
in the car, quick!

32:23.098 --> 32:24.633
Hank, is she okay?

32:24.665 --> 32:26.635
She's badly hurt!
Call the vet!

32:26.667 --> 32:28.603
Tell them we're on our way.
It's an emergency!

32:28.636 --> 32:30.405
- Okay.
- Now!

32:35.844 --> 32:38.414
Doc. Yeah, Charlie's
on her way there.

32:38.446 --> 32:39.714
I think she's
been hit by a car.

32:39.748 --> 32:41.517
Yes, thank you!

32:41.550 --> 32:43.117
John, sit down.

32:43.151 --> 32:45.521
Sit. Please.

32:45.553 --> 32:47.955
You're scaring me.

32:47.989 --> 32:49.392
What happened?

32:50.925 --> 32:53.028
- I'm okay.
- I'm sorry.

32:56.865 --> 32:58.066
I'm so sorry.

32:58.098 --> 33:00.569
- Oh.
- What was that?

33:04.473 --> 33:06.875
<i>This was not in the contract.</i>

33:06.907 --> 33:08.910
<i>Am I on to the
next assignment?</i>

33:08.944 --> 33:11.046
<i>No, Charlie.
You're going to be fine.</i>

33:11.078 --> 33:13.648
<i>The family you are rescuing
needed a little diversion</i>

33:13.682 --> 33:15.517
<i>from their own troubles
for a moment.</i>

33:15.550 --> 33:17.586
<i>So, we gave them
something else to focus on.</i>

33:17.618 --> 33:20.722
<i>Sounds like a standard
priorities check for the family.</i>

33:20.754 --> 33:21.989
<i>Right, boss?</i>

33:22.022 --> 33:23.591
<i>You're absolutely righ.</i>

33:23.625 --> 33:26.528
<i>I'd like to be right
and feel a little less</i>

33:26.560 --> 33:28.730
<i>like I was tossed into
the washing machine.</i>

33:28.762 --> 33:30.765
<i>Let's get you in to see that
doctor for your check-over,</i>

33:30.799 --> 33:32.134
<i>and then we'll wake you
back up</i>

33:32.166 --> 33:34.569
- <i>and you'll be fine.</i>
- Doc! Doc!

33:34.603 --> 33:35.704
Emergency!

33:37.938 --> 33:38.940
You got
to help her, Doc!

33:42.577 --> 33:44.813
- What happened?
- I think she was hit by a car.

33:44.846 --> 33:47.950
- It'll be okay, Jimmy. It'll be okay.
- Okay.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.751
There's a little
tenderness in her paw,

33:49.783 --> 33:51.686
so I can wrap it up, but...

33:51.720 --> 33:54.490
not a scratch at all.

33:54.522 --> 33:57.024
Jimmy, you need
to ring your mother.

33:57.058 --> 34:01.663
Tell her that we just witnessed
a miracle here tonight.

34:01.695 --> 34:03.499
- Charlie.
- All patched up.

34:03.531 --> 34:05.934
<i>You can wrap it up,
but I'm gonna tear it off.</i>

34:11.039 --> 34:12.507
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:14.175 --> 34:16.678
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, how is she doing?

34:17.978 --> 34:19.681
- All right.
- Yeah? She's doing good?

34:19.714 --> 34:22.583
Hi, Charlie.

34:22.617 --> 34:24.185
Hey, why did Dad
leave with Gram?

34:24.217 --> 34:26.021
He's decided to stay
with her for a few weeks.

34:26.053 --> 34:27.989
You know, tonight
kinda scared him,

34:28.022 --> 34:30.225
and he's afraid he might hurt
one of us accidentally.

34:30.257 --> 34:32.627
In fact, his commanding
officer warned me

34:32.659 --> 34:34.128
that he might have some
re-entry issues,

34:34.161 --> 34:37.764
so we just need to give him
a little bit of space.

34:37.797 --> 34:39.065
He's just going to be
right up at Gram's house.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.636
You guys can go visit
any time you want.

34:41.668 --> 34:44.705
Okay. I think me and Charlie
are going to go to sleep.

34:44.737 --> 34:46.774
Okay. All right,
come on, Charlie.

34:49.577 --> 34:50.646
Okay.

34:51.780 --> 34:53.880
It's been a tough day
for Charlie.

34:53.914 --> 34:55.516
Yes, it certainly has.

34:58.285 --> 35:01.722
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning.

35:01.756 --> 35:04.826
This is my friend over at the
Etowah Valley Construction.

35:04.859 --> 35:06.929
It's important.

35:09.330 --> 35:13.035
Are you fixing me breakfast or
are you trying to fix my life?

35:13.068 --> 35:16.638
Whatever it takes, son.
I'm just here to help.

35:29.249 --> 35:31.052
- Hi, darlin'!
- Morning, Nana.

35:31.086 --> 35:32.988
Oh, good morning,
sweetheart.

35:33.021 --> 35:34.957
How about a little
extra breakfast?

35:34.990 --> 35:37.825
I have hot biscuits
in that oven,

35:37.859 --> 35:40.963
and I've got some country gravy
with sausage on the stove.

35:41.997 --> 35:43.598
No, thanks.

35:43.631 --> 35:46.200
Now, mama, how's she
handling this drama?

35:46.234 --> 35:48.837
Because she is in the middle
of her busiest season.

35:48.870 --> 35:50.839
I don't think she has time
to think about it.

35:50.872 --> 35:53.609
- Oh.
- She's really worried about Dad, though.

35:53.642 --> 35:55.611
Yeah, me too.

35:55.644 --> 35:57.111
Well, I can't
talk about this now.

35:57.144 --> 35:58.646
- I need to go to school.
- Of course you do.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.116
- I got soccer practice after.
- Ooh!

36:01.149 --> 36:02.984
- Um, can Charlie stay here with you?
- Well, of course!

36:03.017 --> 36:04.385
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, baby.

36:04.419 --> 36:06.754
<i>I want to see
Uncle Ron.</i>

36:15.062 --> 36:17.398
Oh! Oh, hey!

36:17.432 --> 36:21.269
Look at that.
Oh, you're okay.

36:21.301 --> 36:24.905
- Are you okay?
- <i>I love you, Uncle Ron.</i>

36:24.939 --> 36:28.410
Okay, let's go get a sausage.
Let's go, come on. Go.

36:28.443 --> 36:30.011
Let's go.

36:43.024 --> 36:44.760
You must be John.

36:44.792 --> 36:46.060
Come on in.

36:52.133 --> 36:54.169
I'm Dr. Warren.

36:54.202 --> 36:55.370
Have a seat.

37:00.408 --> 37:01.310
Ahem.

37:03.477 --> 37:07.182
So, I'm here to help you, okay?
Whatever that looks like.

37:07.214 --> 37:09.684
I'm not here to judge you.
I'm here to help you.

37:09.718 --> 37:10.653
Okay?

37:12.319 --> 37:14.189
I do have
a few questions.

37:14.222 --> 37:16.758
Okay. Here we go.

37:18.859 --> 37:20.828
Is there anything
you've always wanted to do?

37:20.861 --> 37:22.129
Yeah.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.465
I always wanted
to join the military,

37:24.499 --> 37:25.968
ever since I was
a young kid.

37:27.267 --> 37:29.203
And I did that.

37:29.236 --> 37:31.205
Now that chapter's over.

37:31.238 --> 37:33.407
Is it what you
thought it would be?

37:33.441 --> 37:35.176
Sometimes it was.

37:35.209 --> 37:38.312
Just nothing
can prepare you for...

37:38.345 --> 37:41.816
...the things
you see over there...

37:41.850 --> 37:46.221
and-and the sounds that you hear, and...
the smell.

37:48.122 --> 37:51.693
And the constant anticipation
of there being a roadside bomb.

37:53.861 --> 37:55.830
Just left me
a little skittish.

37:56.830 --> 37:58.867
Let's look forward.

37:58.899 --> 38:01.470
That past is going to be
with you for a long time.

38:01.502 --> 38:05.073
The PTSD will begin to have
less of a grip on you

38:05.106 --> 38:08.477
once you replace it
with a more calm experience,

38:08.510 --> 38:10.845
when you have
a renewed sense of purpose.

38:10.879 --> 38:12.814
My only goal,
really,

38:12.847 --> 38:16.285
is to try to get to the next
day without hurting anyone.

38:17.919 --> 38:22.491
Including Charlie,
this little white poodle dog

38:22.524 --> 38:26.094
that my son decided to adopt
while I was away.

38:26.127 --> 38:29.097
Does the little
white dog bother you?

38:29.129 --> 38:31.133
A little bit.

38:31.165 --> 38:33.836
John, did you have
a military working dog?

38:37.839 --> 38:39.508
I had this dog
called Tango.

38:41.876 --> 38:46.080
He died...
after an IED.

38:46.113 --> 38:49.117
It happened... last year.

38:50.584 --> 38:53.054
He was my best friend
for over two years.

38:54.088 --> 38:56.223
So, you lost
your best friend.

38:56.256 --> 38:58.092
Do you think
that's the reason

38:58.126 --> 39:02.097
that the relationship Charlie has
with Jimmy bothers you so much?

39:02.129 --> 39:04.532
I suppose so.

39:04.566 --> 39:08.904
But I was planning on getting Jimmy a
German Shepherd like Tango when I got back,

39:08.937 --> 39:11.839
but then he had this little
white poodle dog,

39:11.872 --> 39:13.809
who follows me
everywhere.

39:13.841 --> 39:18.914
And I just can't seem to shake her.

39:18.946 --> 39:20.149
There she is right now!

39:21.316 --> 39:23.852
Oh! She's so cute!

39:23.885 --> 39:27.022
Maybe she's on a mission
on her own.

39:27.055 --> 39:30.125
You know, not all angels
have wings and halos.

39:31.225 --> 39:32.560
I'm having lunch
with Captain Jack

39:32.593 --> 39:34.896
at the hoagie shop right
across from the park.

39:34.928 --> 39:37.398
Why don't you join us?

39:37.432 --> 39:39.434
Yeah, sure.

39:39.466 --> 39:41.102
Good. Let's go.

40:00.488 --> 40:01.423
Jack?

40:02.490 --> 40:03.859
- Jack.
- What?

40:04.658 --> 40:06.493
I wanted you to meet John.

40:06.526 --> 40:09.231
He just came in
from Afghanistan.

40:10.265 --> 40:12.467
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:14.269 --> 40:16.338
How did it go
at the VA's office last week?

40:16.370 --> 40:18.073
Is there anything I can
help you with down there?

40:18.106 --> 40:19.441
It was okay.

40:22.142 --> 40:23.911
They want me to have
more sessions with you

40:23.944 --> 40:26.314
- to help stabilize my family unit.
- Mm-hmm.

40:26.347 --> 40:28.550
But hell, my family doesn't
know where or how I'm livin'.

40:30.084 --> 40:31.986
I guess I was kinda mean
to 'em when I got home.

40:34.088 --> 40:36.624
I don't even know how
to talk to them anymore.

40:36.658 --> 40:40.095
I want you to come
see me next week, okay?

40:40.127 --> 40:42.030
Okay.

40:42.062 --> 40:43.464
I'm all right, though.

40:43.497 --> 40:45.266
Just praying
for a mild winter.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.068
Well, good luck with that.
It's already snowed twice,

40:48.102 --> 40:50.272
and it's not even
Christmas day yet.

40:50.305 --> 40:53.375
Are you working
around here?

40:53.408 --> 40:54.576
Huh?

40:54.609 --> 40:57.179
I said, are you
working around here?

40:58.412 --> 41:00.048
Sometimes.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.385
Have you ever heard of Etowah
Construction Company?

41:04.419 --> 41:06.054
Yeah, I worked
with 'em before.

41:06.086 --> 41:08.188
They hire a lot of vets.

41:08.222 --> 41:11.158
You might want to catch up
with Roy Sutherland over there.

41:11.191 --> 41:13.560
Yeah, I'm actually
in contact with him.

41:13.593 --> 41:16.964
I'm heading over there
right after I finish this.

41:24.004 --> 41:27.575
Yeah, I got it. I want
27 floor samples on...

41:27.607 --> 41:29.144
- You John?
- Yeah.

41:29.176 --> 41:30.511
Okay, let me call you
right back, hold on.

41:31.578 --> 41:32.981
Blitz.

41:33.013 --> 41:34.582
Arthur told me
about you.

41:34.615 --> 41:36.685
Is that your dog?

41:38.452 --> 41:40.187
- Complicated.
- Complicated.

41:40.220 --> 41:41.588
All right,
well, here's the deal.

41:41.622 --> 41:43.692
I'll go ahead and pick
you up in the morning.

41:43.725 --> 41:47.062
I think it'd probably be best if
you left the dog at home, though.

41:47.095 --> 41:50.064
I'l try, but she
follows me everywhere.

41:50.097 --> 41:51.365
Okay, 6:30.

41:51.399 --> 41:53.167
Now I usually stop
by the Moose Lodge.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.568
It's a reasonable spread.

41:54.602 --> 41:56.705
So, if you're hungry,
that'll be the spot.

41:56.738 --> 41:58.272
How you looking on gear?

41:58.305 --> 41:59.606
I have
my service helmet.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.509
Yeah, that's probably
not going to work.

42:01.542 --> 42:05.380
I tell you what,
you can go ahead and use mine,

42:05.412 --> 42:06.613
and that'll get you going.

42:06.647 --> 42:11.286
- What are you, English?
- My dad is.

42:11.318 --> 42:13.454
I spent
a lot of time over there.

42:13.488 --> 42:15.022
Complicated.

42:15.055 --> 42:16.423
Early morning, John.

42:22.662 --> 42:25.065
Emily, can you take care
of the cafe for the weekend?

42:25.098 --> 42:26.667
- Absolutely.
- And Kate,

42:26.700 --> 42:28.435
can you get the last four orders
out for the rest of the day?

42:28.468 --> 42:30.271
Oh, yeah, definitely.

42:30.303 --> 42:32.573
Oh, just remember Christine
comes in Sunday night.

42:32.606 --> 42:34.541
We're in final
wedding day countdown.

42:34.575 --> 42:36.345
<i>Don't forget me!</i>

42:38.178 --> 42:41.115
- Thanks for backing me up.
- Of course.

42:41.149 --> 42:42.551
You know it.

42:44.252 --> 42:47.655
Dinner for two.
Can we get it later?

42:49.189 --> 42:51.225
Jill! Uh...

42:51.258 --> 42:54.028
We need to go over
Will's wedding plans.

42:54.062 --> 42:58.500
Yeah. Okay.
All me.

43:02.736 --> 43:03.738
<i>Here you go, Cap.</i>

43:05.138 --> 43:07.041
Looks like
somebody's been busy.

43:07.075 --> 43:10.044
You working for the Etowah
Construction Company now, John?

43:10.077 --> 43:12.413
I'm gonna give it
my best shot.

43:12.446 --> 43:15.450
Haven't done this work
in two decades.

43:15.482 --> 43:16.651
Maybe it'll get me
back into shape.

43:16.684 --> 43:18.153
Lookin' pretty fit to me.

43:18.185 --> 43:19.687
Listen, Harpster's on site,

43:19.720 --> 43:21.689
so be advised everything
is gonna get moved around

43:21.722 --> 43:24.426
at least three times
before we get started.

43:24.459 --> 43:25.527
Got that right.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.362
Yeah. Makes
for a long day.

43:27.394 --> 43:30.330
Why did you hire him
if he's so inefficient?

43:30.363 --> 43:32.533
Well, he actually
owns the company, John.

43:32.566 --> 43:34.068
He writes
all the checks.

43:34.102 --> 43:36.504
Now you tell me.

43:36.537 --> 43:38.406
You're going
to fit in great, John.

43:38.439 --> 43:40.375
Listen, he loves
helping a vet,

43:40.408 --> 43:42.243
and he was 4-F himself,

43:42.276 --> 43:46.314
but he always has room on
a crew for a guy like you.

43:49.383 --> 43:51.718
Hey! Hey, don't stand
there like a lox!

43:51.752 --> 43:53.755
Go! Yeah, you!

43:53.787 --> 43:55.122
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

43:57.658 --> 43:58.827
Just point me
in the right direction.

43:58.859 --> 44:00.261
All right, bud,
let's go.

44:01.629 --> 44:04.332
Tell you what,
let's start right on over here.

44:07.334 --> 44:09.771
- Holy cannoli.
- What? Did you win?

44:09.803 --> 44:15.609
No. Tonight is the Christmas
concert at Etowah Theatre.

44:15.642 --> 44:17.778
Amy, a good friend of mine,
her granddaughter's in it,

44:17.812 --> 44:20.448
and I promised
that I would take her.

44:20.481 --> 44:24.285
John, isn't Jimmy
in the show as well?

44:24.318 --> 44:26.287
- Yep.
- Why don't you guys come with me?

44:26.319 --> 44:28.155
I mean, we can get ourselves
some Christmas spirit.

44:28.189 --> 44:29.491
I don't want to go.

44:29.524 --> 44:31.126
- Come on, Jack.
- I don't want to go.

44:31.158 --> 44:33.461
Well, I have to go.

44:33.493 --> 44:36.263
I need to patch
things up with my son.

44:36.296 --> 44:38.765
- Can we take your truck?
- Yeah, no worries.

44:38.798 --> 44:42.136
Let's do it, guys!

44:42.169 --> 44:44.638
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah, come on, Cap.

44:44.671 --> 44:46.907
- Eh.
- <i>Come on, Jack.</i>

44:46.941 --> 44:48.910
<i>You could use
a Christmas spirit boost.</i>

44:48.943 --> 44:51.211
I guess it won't
kill me, Charlie.

44:51.245 --> 44:52.781
<i>Let's go.</i>

44:54.481 --> 44:55.617
Come on, Charlie.

45:04.392 --> 45:07.194
Go down there, and you have
a wonderful concert, okay?

45:07.227 --> 45:09.263
- Mm-hmm.
- Go.

45:12.432 --> 45:14.168
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:14.202 --> 45:16.937
I'm Pastor PK, and I want
to welcome you tonight

45:16.970 --> 45:20.574
to kick off the holiday
season the right way,

45:20.607 --> 45:23.912
and always remember the
real reason for the season.

45:25.213 --> 45:26.481
Oh, what do
we got, guys?

45:26.513 --> 45:27.881
- Grab something, Hank.
- Oh, yeah.

45:27.914 --> 45:30.518
I think I'll have
a Georgia Peach.

45:31.586 --> 45:33.254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

45:33.287 --> 45:35.522
So good to see some
friendly faces in the back,

45:35.555 --> 45:37.425
some veterans...
Hank.

45:37.457 --> 45:39.226
Captain Jack.

45:39.260 --> 45:42.564
Blitz. Ronnie.
Good to have you tonight.

45:42.597 --> 45:44.332
Tonight is for you,

45:44.365 --> 45:46.200
and all you've done
for our country.

45:46.234 --> 45:47.735
I'm so glad
you made it.

45:47.767 --> 45:50.604
It just started.

45:50.638 --> 45:52.807
- Sorry I'm late, babe.
- It's all right.

45:52.839 --> 45:54.975
Before we begin tonight,
I'd like to take a moment

45:55.008 --> 45:58.478
to remember an old friend,
a veteran, Ollie.

45:58.511 --> 46:02.450
You remember Ollie?
We lost him a year ago today.

46:02.482 --> 46:06.220
That snowstorm and cold front that came in.
He died of exposure.

46:06.254 --> 46:09.324
Let's take a moment
to remember him. Corey?

46:44.658 --> 46:45.727
Thank you, Corey.

46:47.495 --> 46:48.863
And thank you all
for coming.

46:48.896 --> 46:52.466
And without further ado,
in the spirit of Christmas,

46:52.499 --> 46:54.801
the Etowah Youth Choir.

47:41.716 --> 47:45.586
Right. Everybody, "Hark!
The Herald Angels Sing."

47:51.691 --> 47:54.461
Let's be serious.
From the top.

48:34.901 --> 48:37.537
Blitz, do you ever think
we should mix it up a little?

48:37.571 --> 48:39.774
I mean, we're here
morning, noon and night.

48:39.807 --> 48:42.477
And now, thanks to Captain
Jack, we're here Saturdays.

48:42.510 --> 48:45.580
We see the same
people day after day.

48:45.613 --> 48:46.914
It feels
like <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

48:46.946 --> 48:50.352
Well,
I have my reasons, man.

48:53.053 --> 48:56.891
- So I'm seeing this VA therapist.
- Uh-huh.

48:56.923 --> 49:00.560
And she says you Marines
are not good at sharing.

49:00.593 --> 49:02.129
Oh, is that right?

49:02.162 --> 49:03.664
I think she's right.

49:03.696 --> 49:05.999
- I appreciate it.
- How you guys doing?

49:06.033 --> 49:08.803
Good, Jack.
What's going on, man?

49:08.836 --> 49:11.406
By the way, Charlie
come back in?

49:11.439 --> 49:14.008
I let her out earlier.
I...

49:14.040 --> 49:16.778
I haven't seen her.
Seen her, Jack?

49:16.810 --> 49:20.147
Not since
early this morning.

49:20.180 --> 49:23.885
- You guys seen Hank?
- Not yet.

49:25.553 --> 49:28.189
That ain't like him.

49:28.222 --> 49:30.591
Maybe she's gotten
into something.

49:30.624 --> 49:33.395
- I'll go check.
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

49:35.095 --> 49:36.030
All right.

49:39.098 --> 49:40.033
Huh.

49:43.470 --> 49:44.571
Hank!

49:53.781 --> 49:54.983
<i>Hank!</i>

49:58.252 --> 50:00.021
<i>Hank, where are you?</i>

50:06.260 --> 50:08.796
<i>Where are you, Han?</i>

50:08.828 --> 50:09.897
Charlie!

50:11.031 --> 50:12.767
Charlie!

50:16.002 --> 50:16.870
Charlie!

50:23.042 --> 50:24.678
<i>Where are you, Hank?</i>

50:30.551 --> 50:32.086
<i>Hank!</i>

50:33.620 --> 50:34.588
<i>Help!</i>

50:35.756 --> 50:38.559
<i>Hank's over here!</i>

50:38.591 --> 50:40.528
Charlie!

50:42.129 --> 50:43.531
Charlie!

50:43.564 --> 50:45.165
Charlie?

50:45.198 --> 50:47.534
Come on, girl.

50:47.568 --> 50:49.102
Hank!

50:49.135 --> 50:51.037
- Hank!
- Hank!

50:51.071 --> 50:53.607
Hank, are you okay?

50:53.640 --> 50:55.108
- Hank.
- Hey, Charlie.

50:55.142 --> 50:56.711
- Hank.
- Come on, roll him on over.

50:57.912 --> 51:00.080
<i>Oh, Hank.
Hang in there with us.</i>

51:00.113 --> 51:01.781
- <i>Hang in there, Hank.</i>
- Can you hear me?

51:01.814 --> 51:04.818
Can you hear me?

51:04.852 --> 51:05.886
- Call 9-1-1.
- Yeah.

51:05.919 --> 51:07.921
Call an ambulance, now!

51:21.968 --> 51:23.871
Well done,
Charlie.

51:24.972 --> 51:26.207
Blanket.

51:35.816 --> 51:37.584
You're okay.

51:37.618 --> 51:40.588
<i>Not Hank!
Please, not Hank.</i>

51:40.620 --> 51:43.624
<i>After Jimmy,
Hank is my best friend!</i>

51:43.656 --> 51:45.693
<i>Not to worry, Charlie.</i>

51:45.725 --> 51:47.261
<i>I like Hank too.</i>

51:49.062 --> 51:50.631
Come on, John.

51:50.664 --> 51:52.232
- Hank.
- Stay with us, Hank.

51:52.265 --> 51:54.001
What is that?

51:54.033 --> 51:55.736
Purple Heart.

52:08.182 --> 52:09.617
Hank...

52:38.011 --> 52:39.280
So, what do you call
this place?

52:42.115 --> 52:44.217
Some of us
call it home.

52:44.251 --> 52:46.319
So, you vets
are homeless?

52:46.352 --> 52:47.354
Man.

52:48.856 --> 52:50.191
After serving your country,

52:50.223 --> 52:51.725
this is... this is
where you live now?

52:51.758 --> 52:54.794
- In tents?
- Something like that.

52:54.827 --> 52:57.664
So, that's why I keep seeing you
in these familiar places,

52:57.698 --> 52:59.634
trying to keep warm
or get something to eat,

52:59.667 --> 53:01.702
or catch a day job, huh?

53:01.734 --> 53:04.238
It's been like that
for three years for me now.

53:04.271 --> 53:06.006
Where's your family?

53:06.039 --> 53:11.378
I had a couple of bad
incidents with my family,

53:11.412 --> 53:15.783
which made me stray away.
I just strayed away.

53:15.816 --> 53:19.386
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
And I still don't.

53:19.419 --> 53:22.188
I have a nephew
that plays ball for UGA.

53:22.222 --> 53:23.957
He's good!

53:23.990 --> 53:28.194
I just save money and try to
see him play whenever I can.

53:28.227 --> 53:30.231
- Does he know you're here?
- No.

53:30.263 --> 53:33.066
Like I told you, I try
to stay under the radar.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.935
I don't want anybody
to know I'm out here.

53:34.968 --> 53:37.338
I'm sure
he wouldn't mind knowing.

53:37.370 --> 53:39.073
I said something
I regret to his mom.

53:39.106 --> 53:40.808
She doesn't know
I'm out here either.

53:42.008 --> 53:43.677
That's why we don't like

53:43.711 --> 53:47.013
law enforcement and ambulances
coming around here.

53:47.046 --> 53:49.215
It blows our cover.

53:49.249 --> 53:51.252
Or it blows
your covers off!

54:01.394 --> 54:03.063
Charlie!

54:08.267 --> 54:09.436
Oh, Charlie.

54:14.908 --> 54:18.379
Charlie. There you are.

54:20.214 --> 54:22.116
Come here.
Are you cold?

54:23.950 --> 54:26.286
- - You saved
a life today, you did.

54:26.319 --> 54:28.189
You're a good boy.

54:28.222 --> 54:29.323
I mean, girl.

54:39.265 --> 54:41.901
- Are you comfortable?
- Incredibly.

54:41.935 --> 54:45.372
My biggest shock
was the food.

54:45.405 --> 54:48.008
Hospital food
is so underrated.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.044
Well, we just have
a few more tests to run,

54:50.077 --> 54:52.946
and you should be able to eat
just about anything you want.

54:52.979 --> 54:54.180
Oh, good.

54:54.214 --> 54:55.883
Now, the doctor's going
to be here shortly

54:55.915 --> 54:57.952
to give you an update,
but, in the meantime,

54:57.984 --> 55:00.253
I wouldn't be in any rush
to get out of here.

55:00.287 --> 55:03.323
- It's really cold outside.
- Yeah.

55:03.356 --> 55:06.292
Good morning, Chief Warrant
Officer Wentworth.

55:06.325 --> 55:08.762
I hear we had an incident
with the ticker.

55:08.796 --> 55:10.097
- Morning, Doc.
- Oh.

55:10.129 --> 55:12.465
You know, I was
in the Army too. Major.

55:12.499 --> 55:14.001
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

55:14.033 --> 55:15.301
So, um, there's
good news here.

55:15.334 --> 55:17.203
You had a relatively mild
heart attack

55:17.236 --> 55:20.140
that was complicated
with a lung infection,

55:20.173 --> 55:23.877
but you're required to stay in a
warm, dry place in order to recover,

55:23.910 --> 55:25.146
and you should
recover fully.

55:25.178 --> 55:27.847
Good news for a lad
your age, huh?

55:27.881 --> 55:31.819
- Yeah, great.
- So, helicopter pilot.

55:31.852 --> 55:33.521
- Yes, Hueys mainly.
- Oh.

55:33.553 --> 55:35.222
You know, you're never
really tested in Medicine

55:35.254 --> 55:38.091
until you have to practice
in a MASH unit.

55:38.124 --> 55:40.894
He can walk around now,
with assistance.

55:40.928 --> 55:42.797
I will be happy
to assist you.

55:42.830 --> 55:44.932
We'll start you
walking around tomorrow.

55:44.964 --> 55:47.334
In the meantime, relax,
enjoy your company

55:47.367 --> 55:49.537
and some more of the
delicious hospital cuisine.

55:49.569 --> 55:50.972
I'll be back this evening.

56:00.347 --> 56:02.249
<i>Today,
what happened in this town</i>

56:02.281 --> 56:03.950
<i>is we discovered
that great men</i>

56:03.984 --> 56:06.187
that have served
this country, veterans,

56:06.220 --> 56:08.888
they don't have a home.

56:08.921 --> 56:13.993
Those are veterans that have
really protected our home...

56:14.026 --> 56:17.231
so that we can enjoy
what we call a home.

56:18.531 --> 56:20.367
I mean, they're right
here amongst us.

56:20.399 --> 56:22.169
Just think of Hank.

56:23.502 --> 56:27.106
It is time for this town
to take action.

56:27.140 --> 56:28.576
What are we going to do?

56:28.609 --> 56:31.879
Who wants to do something,
and do something now?

56:31.912 --> 56:35.149
- That's what I want to know.
- I say we get a team together...

56:35.182 --> 56:37.184
and we build
these vets a house.

56:37.216 --> 56:39.419
Now, who's with me?

56:43.923 --> 56:45.525
There we go!

56:45.559 --> 56:47.560
You know what, John?

56:47.593 --> 56:50.964
I agree, and I think God's
already brought the team together.

56:50.997 --> 56:52.131
Check this out!

56:52.164 --> 56:53.533
We want to build
some homes?

56:53.566 --> 56:56.603
Roy knows how to do that.
He's an architect.

56:56.636 --> 56:59.207
Let's do it.
I say let's do it!

57:01.475 --> 57:04.078
Jim, can we get
the vets together?

57:04.111 --> 57:05.511
- Can you do that for us?
- Mm-hmm.

57:05.544 --> 57:07.914
Excellent! Excellent!

57:10.484 --> 57:14.255
You can't build a house
unless you have some land.

57:16.589 --> 57:18.158
And Mayor Aurora,

57:18.191 --> 57:20.426
do you think you can get
the city council

57:20.459 --> 57:22.963
to provide some land
for the vets?

57:22.995 --> 57:25.899
I can definitely find you
some land, Pastor.

57:25.932 --> 57:28.001
There's the land.
Let's give her the hand!

57:29.602 --> 57:32.438
What's the next thing
we need to do?

57:32.472 --> 57:35.408
I think it's time to get some supplies.
Come on, Blitz.

57:35.441 --> 57:37.377
Let's do it!
Let's do it!

57:46.953 --> 57:49.522
It's an amazing time
of year, isn't it?

57:49.555 --> 57:51.224
Lots of forgiveness
in the air.

57:52.559 --> 57:54.995
Don't get your hopes up
too high there, John.

57:55.028 --> 57:57.564
We've seen
enthusiasm before.

57:57.597 --> 57:59.200
And once things
get out of sight...

58:00.700 --> 58:03.937
dies back down
into see no evil,

58:03.970 --> 58:07.474
hear no evil,
do nothing.

58:08.475 --> 58:10.243
Oh, come on, Jack.

58:10.276 --> 58:11.444
Where's
your Christmas spirit?

58:12.678 --> 58:15.415
Been a while since Saint Nic
paid a visit.

58:18.151 --> 58:19.687
- Here, pull in here.
- All right.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.422
I need to go
check on Jimmy.

58:21.455 --> 58:23.524
I promised him I'd stop by
and watch him play soccer.

58:23.557 --> 58:24.457
Mm-hmm.

58:48.314 --> 58:50.583
Great job, Jimmy!

58:53.386 --> 58:55.122
- Great job, bud.
- Hey, Dad.

58:55.155 --> 58:58.524
- Hey, good job.
- <i>Good job, Jimmy!</i>

58:58.557 --> 59:00.593
Charlie saved Hank's life.

59:00.627 --> 59:03.030
<i>I'm the hero today.</i>

59:03.062 --> 59:05.465
So, I guess we can keep her?

59:05.499 --> 59:07.301
That's good with me.

59:07.334 --> 59:08.569
Good job.

59:08.602 --> 59:10.370
- Thank you. Bye.
- See you, buddy.

59:26.419 --> 59:28.055
It's a great day!

59:28.088 --> 59:30.124
Thank you very much,
Mayor and Council,

59:30.156 --> 59:33.361
for donating this site for
this project to be built.

59:36.763 --> 59:38.298
- What do you need?
- Thanks for showing up.

59:38.330 --> 59:39.633
Absolutely.
You doing all right?

59:39.665 --> 59:42.769
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, good.

59:43.702 --> 59:45.305
Carry it over.

59:49.443 --> 59:52.379
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, man. What's up, John?

59:52.412 --> 59:54.680
Have you seen my brother-in-law,
Ronnie, recently?

59:54.714 --> 59:56.116
Jill is worried
about him.

59:56.149 --> 59:59.053
PTSD is tough.
You know firsthand.

59:59.086 --> 01:00:01.288
I mean, you've just
experienced that,

01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:05.125
but the encouraging thing is,
look what we're doing here.

01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:10.497
All right!
This is the last play.

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:12.800
Let's play the game,
we're going for a Hail Mary!

01:00:12.832 --> 01:00:15.234
That's what we're doing!
Hail Mary!

01:00:15.267 --> 01:00:16.669
Let's go!
It's Christmas!

01:00:26.613 --> 01:00:28.448
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

01:00:28.481 --> 01:00:29.782
- Good!
- We brought Charlie.

01:00:29.816 --> 01:00:32.586
Hey, my little girl.

01:00:32.618 --> 01:00:35.122
Why didn't you say
anything, Hank?

01:00:35.155 --> 01:00:38.492
Uh... I didn't want to be a
burden, upset people.

01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:40.794
- You're never a bother.
- Ah.

01:00:43.863 --> 01:00:46.165
Good afternoon,
my man. How are...

01:00:46.198 --> 01:00:49.403
Oh. Hi. I didn't know
you had visitors.

01:00:49.435 --> 01:00:50.336
Hi.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.405
So how you doing, Hank?

01:00:51.437 --> 01:00:53.106
I'm fine, thanks, Doc.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.309
I can't wait to get out
of here and get some real food.

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:57.610
I bet you are, yeah.
I'll check back with you a little later.

01:00:57.644 --> 01:00:58.846
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:00:58.879 --> 01:01:00.347
Mm-hmm.

01:01:05.285 --> 01:01:06.287
Captain Jack!

01:01:08.522 --> 01:01:09.757
Captain.

01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:13.660
Is that you out there?

01:01:14.928 --> 01:01:17.798
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Hey, man.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.334
- What do you need, Rev?
- It's cold out here.

01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:22.303
- Yeah.
- Checking on you.

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.140
Whoo. Cold night.

01:01:26.173 --> 01:01:27.841
Yeah, not as cold
as the night before, though.

01:01:27.874 --> 01:01:31.645
- Whoo.
- Sun kinda warmed it up.

01:01:31.678 --> 01:01:34.348
I got some canned goods up at the
Moose Lodge for you and the guys.

01:01:34.381 --> 01:01:36.482
And maybe
some more blankets.

01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:39.552
Always use some more blankets.

01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:41.821
- That a car coming?
- I don't know.

01:01:41.854 --> 01:01:44.657
Keep it quiet, Rev.
It's too cold to move right now.

01:01:46.593 --> 01:01:50.830
I read in the paper your sister
is running for state Senate.

01:01:50.863 --> 01:01:53.367
Did you hear about that?
Pretty impressive.

01:01:54.434 --> 01:01:56.769
She's a smart one.

01:01:56.803 --> 01:01:58.205
How you know
she was my sister?

01:01:58.238 --> 01:02:01.274
Oh, way of knowing things.

01:02:01.307 --> 01:02:04.510
Don't you think it's maybe time for
you to reconnect with your sister?

01:02:04.544 --> 01:02:05.946
What do you say?

01:02:05.979 --> 01:02:08.881
I'd like to see them all,
but I don't know about now.

01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:11.817
I don't know if this is
the right time, you know?

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:13.720
I always got your back.

01:02:13.752 --> 01:02:16.589
Got your six,
got your six.

01:02:16.622 --> 01:02:17.758
All right.

01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:21.528
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Hank, Hank, Hank, Hank.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.363
- Come on, come on, that's...
- What?

01:02:23.396 --> 01:02:25.198
- Let's go back this way, come on.
- Oh, come on!

01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:29.235
"Our words should be like little
silver boxes with bows on top."

01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:32.606
That's like a little breakdown of what
Florence Littauer's little girl said.

01:02:32.638 --> 01:02:35.374
I thought this was
supposed to be a fun game.

01:02:35.408 --> 01:02:36.443
It is a fun game!

01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:37.977
Yeah, for some of us.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.845
Come on!
Yeah, yeah, let's go!

01:02:39.879 --> 01:02:42.516
- Oh, stop, stop, stop.
- Yeah! Whee!

01:02:42.548 --> 01:02:44.450
- You're in trouble.
- What? Come on!

01:02:44.484 --> 01:02:46.953
- Hold it there and I'll...
- Oh, shush. Walk.

01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:50.390
I've heard a lot about you.

01:02:50.423 --> 01:02:52.258
You're a real hero
to this town.

01:02:52.292 --> 01:02:53.594
I wouldn't believe that.

01:02:54.928 --> 01:02:56.396
- Nice!
- Good job!

01:02:58.397 --> 01:02:59.966
Hey, I'm
Captain Jack's nephew.

01:02:59.999 --> 01:03:02.602
You can use me on anything
that needs a reach.

01:03:04.037 --> 01:03:06.906
I guess. Ah, let's see
what you can do.

01:03:08.408 --> 01:03:11.444
- Any kids?
- No. You?

01:03:11.477 --> 01:03:13.280
I have a daughter.
Shelby.

01:03:13.312 --> 01:03:17.617
I lost my wife
about 20 years ago.

01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:21.555
Um, I haven't spoken to Shelby
for a number of years.

01:03:21.588 --> 01:03:24.225
I just didn't want
to be a burden to her.

01:03:25.758 --> 01:03:29.328
I would want to know,
if it were me.

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:31.564
It's... it's a little
more complicated.

01:03:31.597 --> 01:03:32.932
<i>A man was discovered...</i>

01:03:32.966 --> 01:03:35.435
I think I need to have
a little lie down.

01:03:35.468 --> 01:03:37.571
<i>The man has been identified
as Hank Wentworth,</i>

01:03:37.604 --> 01:03:40.274
<i>who has been taken
to Mercy General Hospital.</i>

01:03:40.307 --> 01:03:42.376
<i>He is expected
to fully recover.</i>

01:03:42.408 --> 01:03:44.343
- <i>What made this story bigger...</i>
- Let's get you lying down.

01:03:44.377 --> 01:03:45.712
- No, no.
- What?

01:03:45.745 --> 01:03:47.547
<i>...was discovered here
in the woods</i>

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.982
<i>where there were more
than a dozen homeless veterans</i>

01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:53.586
<i>living here for years,
unknownst to the community of Etowah.</i>

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.455
They-they found
the Tent City.

01:03:56.488 --> 01:03:58.824
- Oh, where is everybody?
- It's okay.

01:03:58.857 --> 01:04:00.926
- No, where is everybody?
- We'll find out.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:01.927
We'll find out, okay?

01:04:01.961 --> 01:04:03.763
- No.
- I'm sure...

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:06.732
- Where have they all gone?
- I'm sure they're fine.

01:04:06.765 --> 01:04:10.604
<i>This has been brought to the attention of
Etowah's mayor Aurora Hall, and Pastor PK,</i>

01:04:10.636 --> 01:04:14.675
<i>who have immediately called a town hall
meeting to address this issue at once.</i>

01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:18.311
- Get some sleep.
- Could you do something for me, please?

01:04:19.713 --> 01:04:23.617
Can you find Jill?

01:04:23.649 --> 01:04:26.352
Ring her, please,
and get her to tell Jimmy

01:04:26.385 --> 01:04:29.555
I have the Christmas tree in
the back of the truck, okay?

01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:32.092
Okay, okay.
You lie down. Quiet.

01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:35.394
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Jill. Shh, shh, shh.

01:04:35.428 --> 01:04:37.531
Okay.

01:04:37.564 --> 01:04:39.066
<i>It's very cold outside.</i>

01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:40.834
<i>It's very heartbreaking.</i>

01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:43.403
<i>These are terrible
conditions to be living in.</i>

01:04:43.435 --> 01:04:47.740
- <i>I simply can't imagine...</i>
- Yes, hello, Jill. This is Hilde calling.

01:04:47.774 --> 01:04:53.013
I'm here at the hospital with
Hank and he's asked me to call you

01:04:53.046 --> 01:04:55.749
and tell you that he has
a Christmas tree in his truck,

01:04:55.781 --> 01:04:58.984
and you should tell Jimmy,
and that's all.

01:04:59.017 --> 01:05:01.921
Maybe you could call Hank
a little bit later on, okay?

01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:03.891
Thank you, bye-bye.

01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:20.540
<i>Doctor Johnson,
please pick up line 3.</i>

01:05:20.573 --> 01:05:23.510
<i>Doctor Johnson,
please pick up line 3.</i>

01:05:37.189 --> 01:05:38.992
You'll be happy to know

01:05:39.024 --> 01:05:42.662
I'm not sending you home for
the holidays with assignments...

01:05:42.694 --> 01:05:44.131
except for one lucky gentleman,

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:45.832
and he may see me after class.

01:05:45.865 --> 01:05:47.868
Thank you, Mrs. Masters,

01:05:47.901 --> 01:05:51.171
for helping us use math
with our gingerbread.

01:05:51.203 --> 01:05:53.073
Having fun?

01:05:53.106 --> 01:05:54.707
Good.

01:06:11.691 --> 01:06:13.127
Everyone have a great holiday!

01:06:16.229 --> 01:06:17.431
Jimmy?

01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:19.900
Jimmy.

01:06:21.468 --> 01:06:24.004
I have a timely
project for you.

01:06:24.037 --> 01:06:25.439
I think you'll like this one

01:06:25.472 --> 01:06:27.441
and it will wipe out
your bad grade.

01:06:27.473 --> 01:06:29.109
I'm listening.

01:06:29.142 --> 01:06:31.477
It will take
a little research.

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.848
I want you to find out how many towns
and cities there are in America,

01:06:35.881 --> 01:06:40.086
and research how many
homeless veterans there are.

01:06:40.118 --> 01:06:44.089
Figure out what it would cost to
build houses for each of the vets.

01:06:44.122 --> 01:06:45.758
You might need to check
with Mr. Sutherland

01:06:45.792 --> 01:06:48.495
over at the building site
for help with this last part.

01:06:48.528 --> 01:06:50.163
Let's figure out
what it would take,

01:06:50.196 --> 01:06:53.567
mathematically speaking,
to solve this problem.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.202
- Got it, sport?
- Got it.

01:06:55.234 --> 01:06:57.169
Get to work.

01:06:57.202 --> 01:06:59.205
Happy holidays.

01:07:31.905 --> 01:07:33.272
Hey, Jimmy!
How are you?

01:07:33.305 --> 01:07:35.574
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good. Hey, Charlie.

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:36.977
How are you doing?

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:40.213
So, we're building houses
for the homeless veterans.

01:07:40.245 --> 01:07:42.281
Is there a way
you could donate?

01:07:42.314 --> 01:07:44.050
Oh, I'd love to!

01:07:47.754 --> 01:07:48.955
Thank you.

01:07:48.988 --> 01:07:50.924
- Here's a 20.
- A 20!

01:07:52.992 --> 01:07:55.160
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. Thank you.

01:07:55.193 --> 01:07:56.195
You're welcome.

01:07:57.863 --> 01:07:59.698
Okay.

01:07:59.731 --> 01:08:01.200
There you go, Charlie.

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:03.069
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas.

01:08:03.102 --> 01:08:04.605
I hope that helps.

01:08:09.242 --> 01:08:11.644
Here you go, girl.
Is that better?

01:08:11.678 --> 01:08:12.746
Yeah!

01:08:14.613 --> 01:08:16.048
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:18.752
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:24.591
Hey! I've got
some good news.

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:28.127
The fundraising was so good,
we get to build more of these.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.763
When we finish this one,
we'll move right on to the next!

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:32.732
So, when we get
this done, we...

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:34.935
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Ho-ho-ho!

01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:37.604
And Merry Christmas.
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.778
So, when we're done
with... this one...

01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:46.845
we got to do it again?

01:08:46.877 --> 01:08:48.647
We're getting
really good at this,

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.216
like a well-oiled machine.

01:08:50.247 --> 01:08:51.917
So...

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:53.653
When is all this
going to stop?

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:56.990
I suppose when we've housed
all the homeless vets.

01:08:57.022 --> 01:09:01.026
Yes! Yes! No more homeless...
Whoa! Whoa! Ah.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.796
Did I see... Santa?

01:09:05.064 --> 01:09:06.633
Uncle Jack!

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:16.309
I missed you, man.
Missed you.

01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:18.011
I missed you too.

01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:23.316
There's Mom.

01:09:24.716 --> 01:09:25.719
Want some goodies?

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:28.886
Got sandwiches for you,
like I promised.

01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:30.957
- Thanks, mama.
- You're welcome.

01:09:33.126 --> 01:09:34.761
Hey, Jack!

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.798
You look well.

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:42.167
Been a long time.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.939
Yeah, I have been
really well.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.841
In fact, I've been looking
all over Creation for you.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:52.412
So yeah, your mail
still comes to the house,

01:09:52.444 --> 01:09:57.283
but I had no idea
where to forward it.

01:09:57.315 --> 01:09:58.984
I don't mean
you any harm.

01:09:59.017 --> 01:10:00.854
I just didn't want
to get in your way.

01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:05.659
I see you're running
for public office.

01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:07.360
I am.

01:10:09.928 --> 01:10:12.998
Hey, so maybe you can help me
understand something,

01:10:13.031 --> 01:10:16.102
something that I just
haven't been able to grasp.

01:10:17.936 --> 01:10:21.006
How does a captain
in the Army,

01:10:21.039 --> 01:10:25.678
one that requires a degree, one that
you happen to have from Georgia Tech...

01:10:28.146 --> 01:10:30.082
How did you end up
in a homeless camp, Jack?

01:10:30.115 --> 01:10:31.818
That's not an easy answer,

01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:34.320
and not a conversation
I want to have right now.

01:10:34.352 --> 01:10:36.155
Maybe after the holidays.

01:10:38.324 --> 01:10:40.727
I wish that I'd known sooner.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.061
Things are looking up.

01:10:42.095 --> 01:10:44.396
We're really making
a turnaround here.

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:48.467
That doesn't excuse
the disappearing act.

01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:51.303
Some things are
just beyond explanation.

01:10:51.337 --> 01:10:53.106
Hmm.

01:10:53.138 --> 01:10:56.810
But I saw how you
and Howard connected.

01:10:56.842 --> 01:11:00.413
It's amazing how he's become
such a nice young man, huh?

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.084
Yes, he is.
I follow him from afar.

01:11:06.985 --> 01:11:10.456
Our star basketball player,
my nephew.

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.895
Helping out just
because of me.

01:11:15.927 --> 01:11:20.266
Well, some things are
just beyond explanation.

01:11:24.936 --> 01:11:28.173
Well, well, well.

01:11:28.207 --> 01:11:31.343
Isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:35.781
Tell me, do you have
a date for this evening?

01:11:35.815 --> 01:11:39.319
A date? Well, that's exactly
what I had in mind.

01:11:39.351 --> 01:11:43.756
Which is why I have brought us
this delicious heart-healthy meal

01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:46.158
from my most favorite
Italian restaurant.

01:11:46.191 --> 01:11:49.361
Mm. A little romance.

01:11:49.395 --> 01:11:52.031
I didn't think they allowed
that in the hospital.

01:11:52.064 --> 01:11:55.901
Romance? Romance is
heart-healthy.

01:12:00.006 --> 01:12:01.274
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:12:01.306 --> 01:12:05.344
You know, I could
get really used to this.

01:12:05.378 --> 01:12:09.415
Well, I would really,
really like to make this

01:12:09.448 --> 01:12:14.253
a more frequent occurrence,
if I'm not being too forward.

01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:17.289
You're not being
too forward, my dear.

01:12:17.323 --> 01:12:18.325
You know...

01:12:21.894 --> 01:12:24.497
I...

01:12:24.529 --> 01:12:27.367
look at this as a
new lease on my life.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.271
I don't know if it's going to
work in the future, or if it will,

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:34.440
but...

01:12:34.472 --> 01:12:38.477
everything that I've done

01:12:38.511 --> 01:12:42.516
to try not to be
a burden to anyone...

01:12:50.589 --> 01:12:55.360
Now? Now I'm a burden
to everyone.

01:12:55.394 --> 01:13:00.100
And all I want is to be well
and have my health back.

01:13:03.269 --> 01:13:07.406
Some things just take care of
themselves over time, okay?

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.309
And I...

01:13:11.177 --> 01:13:13.847
Well, I'd like to be a part of
the next chapter in your life.

01:13:13.879 --> 01:13:16.248
I think that we could make
a very nice family together.

01:13:27.927 --> 01:13:30.263
- Hey!
- Hey! What do we have here?

01:13:30.296 --> 01:13:31.998
We have brought
you the decorating committee.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:33.298
The whole class
wanted to help out,

01:13:33.332 --> 01:13:35.401
so we decided to add
some holiday spirit

01:13:35.434 --> 01:13:38.003
to the new houses and make
them feel like a real home.

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:02.628
You know, you and Charlie are
really inspiring, you know that?

01:14:02.662 --> 01:14:05.231
Well, I've got to go.
Are you going to be home for dinner?

01:14:05.263 --> 01:14:06.967
Yeah! I'll call your mom.

01:14:07.967 --> 01:14:09.469
Okay, see you at 5:00.

01:14:09.502 --> 01:14:11.671
Mr. Masters, it was so fun.
Thank you.

01:14:11.704 --> 01:14:13.206
Don't forget
the extra credit project.

01:14:13.239 --> 01:14:14.674
- I won't.
- I'll put this on the door.

01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:24.250
All right, PK.
I'll be right back with those waters.

01:14:24.283 --> 01:14:27.020
- Hey.
- Hey! Is that Harpster over there?

01:14:27.052 --> 01:14:30.489
Yep, looks like he's practicing
giving the dedication.

01:14:30.522 --> 01:14:33.559
I've never seen that man
give a public speech in my life.

01:14:33.592 --> 01:14:36.029
- Is he going to be all right?
- Ah, he just needs a little practice.

01:14:36.061 --> 01:14:38.397
- It'll be fine.
- I think we can all agree on that.

01:14:38.431 --> 01:14:39.966
He's the one who
put up the resources,

01:14:39.998 --> 01:14:41.600
so he's going to be the one
giving the dedication.

01:14:41.633 --> 01:14:43.235
Hmm.

01:14:43.269 --> 01:14:45.038
It's the holidays again,

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:48.573
and this time always makes
me think about my father.

01:14:48.606 --> 01:14:50.443
I know what it's like...

01:14:52.578 --> 01:14:55.114
to be without a family.

01:14:55.146 --> 01:14:57.316
Especially at this time
of the year.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:02.120
That's why I sponsor the...
the homeless Christmas dinner.

01:15:02.154 --> 01:15:05.492
I love the stories
that the vets tell.

01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:08.528
The stories of... of, um,

01:15:08.561 --> 01:15:13.165
being in foreign places
and what it's like to serve,

01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:15.034
and it would be an honor
to just join them

01:15:15.066 --> 01:15:16.601
in the places
they would hang out,

01:15:16.635 --> 01:15:18.972
just for some
of that camaraderie.

01:15:21.239 --> 01:15:23.575
It's just that's not
the way it is.

01:15:23.609 --> 01:15:27.379
But it's gonna be different
this next year. It is!

01:15:27.413 --> 01:15:32.718
Because I'm gonna travel with Santa...
Santa Claus.

01:15:32.752 --> 01:15:35.521
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna
deliver presents

01:15:35.553 --> 01:15:37.589
and help him
spread good cheer.

01:15:39.124 --> 01:15:41.159
See, the greatest gift,

01:15:41.193 --> 01:15:43.596
the greatest gift of all
that you can ever give...

01:15:46.132 --> 01:15:47.701
is to welcome someone.

01:15:49.568 --> 01:15:51.437
To include them.

01:15:55.574 --> 01:15:56.576
Frenchie?

01:15:58.276 --> 01:16:00.646
I'll include you.
You include me?

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.716
Frenchie?

01:16:03.748 --> 01:16:04.751
Frenchie!

01:16:08.154 --> 01:16:09.722
<i>It looks good.</i>

01:16:09.754 --> 01:16:12.257
- <i>And you look beautiful.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

01:16:13.825 --> 01:16:14.761
I'm glad you're home.

01:16:14.793 --> 01:16:16.461
So, I'm really looking forward

01:16:16.494 --> 01:16:17.596
to just spending
quality time...

01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:20.266
Mom! It's December 20th!

01:16:20.298 --> 01:16:21.501
And?

01:16:21.534 --> 01:16:23.603
It's Will and Christine's
wedding!

01:16:23.636 --> 01:16:25.605
You're the caterer!
We're the guests!

01:16:25.637 --> 01:16:27.573
Oh, Ashley Hall is
gonna be there!

01:16:27.605 --> 01:16:29.374
Oh, my gosh!
You are absolutely right,

01:16:29.408 --> 01:16:31.310
and I have totally forgotten
I am the caterer,

01:16:31.342 --> 01:16:33.078
and we are all invited guests.

01:16:33.111 --> 01:16:34.212
I'm not dressed as a guest,

01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:36.248
and I'm not dressed
as a caterer!

01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:37.182
We've got to go. Come on!

01:16:37.216 --> 01:16:38.718
Upstairs. Let's go!

01:16:38.751 --> 01:16:40.619
- What should I wear?
- Sunday best!

01:16:40.653 --> 01:16:42.187
Ashley!

01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:44.824
Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!

01:16:44.856 --> 01:16:46.091
Ashley!

01:16:46.124 --> 01:16:47.627
I cannot believe
I am late.

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:49.461
Forgot!

01:16:49.494 --> 01:16:52.265
<i>You're off to a wedding.
I'm stuck here by myself?</i>

01:16:52.297 --> 01:16:54.232
<i>I don't think so.
I'm heading out.</i>

01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:56.702
Hurry up, guys!
We're going to be late!

01:16:56.735 --> 01:16:58.771
- Oh, my God.
- Almost ready.

01:16:58.803 --> 01:17:01.740
Put my boots on.

01:17:01.774 --> 01:17:03.409
- Ow!
- Oh! Are you okay?

01:17:03.441 --> 01:17:04.709
Yes, I'm fine.

01:17:04.743 --> 01:17:06.178
Come on, Jimmy!

01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:22.361
It's not the evening we had planned, but...
it'll be fun.

01:17:22.394 --> 01:17:24.163
Might be fun,
might be horrible.

01:17:24.195 --> 01:17:25.698
The wedding planner
left me a list a mile long,

01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:27.499
and I haven't seen it since.

01:17:27.533 --> 01:17:29.267
I have totally
dropped the ball.

01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:30.602
You'll be okay.

01:17:30.636 --> 01:17:32.405
They probably had to get
a food truck for dinner.

01:17:32.437 --> 01:17:35.440
If there is a cake,
you'll be in the clear.

01:17:37.443 --> 01:17:39.311
Here they come.

01:17:39.345 --> 01:17:41.314
- Ashley!
- Who is Ashley?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.584
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Who?

01:17:45.618 --> 01:17:48.120
- Ashley.
- Who is Ashley?

01:17:48.154 --> 01:17:49.522
That is Ashley.

01:17:49.555 --> 01:17:51.691
Her mom is moving
here to Etowah.

01:17:51.723 --> 01:17:54.394
And we're going to be in
the same school next year.

01:17:55.394 --> 01:17:56.529
Here comes the bride.

01:18:16.481 --> 01:18:18.484
Let me ask you
a question.

01:18:18.516 --> 01:18:21.386
If you've given back
every stray we've caught,

01:18:21.419 --> 01:18:23.522
how are we ever supposed
to get back in the cruiser?

01:18:23.556 --> 01:18:24.924
See, that's where
we have a disagreement.

01:18:24.957 --> 01:18:27.392
Are they really strays
if we know who owns them?

01:18:27.426 --> 01:18:29.162
If you can get your hands
on one of them,

01:18:29.195 --> 01:18:30.563
and there's not someone
on the other end of the leash,

01:18:30.596 --> 01:18:31.864
then they're fair game!

01:18:31.896 --> 01:18:34.300
Okay, see... no. I don't get
that either, okay?

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:36.669
Because if I know the Chihuahua
belongs to Mrs. Gonzalez,

01:18:36.702 --> 01:18:38.303
what, am I still
supposed to turn it in?

01:18:38.337 --> 01:18:40.339
I mean, what if it just
got out or something, huh?

01:18:40.372 --> 01:18:44.342
She can't pay no $100 fine, and you
know she can't live without her Cheech.

01:18:44.376 --> 01:18:46.745
And I could not live with myself
if something happened to that dog

01:18:46.779 --> 01:18:48.781
just because she can't pay.

01:18:48.814 --> 01:18:50.550
That's the job, Vic!

01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:52.618
Well, it's a
horrible job, Don!

01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:54.186
Well, that's how we
get back in the cruiser!

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.155
Well, look,
I'm out of ideas, okay?

01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:01.727
Look. Isn't that the dog that
goes with the Frost family?

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.628
Oh, yeah,
it's a great idea, Don.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:05.897
Let's capture the dog of the
family helping the homeless vets.

01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:07.800
Oh, that's such great PR.

01:19:07.833 --> 01:19:10.736
It's how we meet our quota.
Go get her!

01:19:10.769 --> 01:19:13.772
Fine. I'll catch her
if I can.

01:19:13.806 --> 01:19:16.242
- You can do this.
- Oh, great, yeah.

01:19:16.275 --> 01:19:18.244
Why am I doing this?
You're the fast one.

01:19:18.276 --> 01:19:20.212
- I'll help.
- Oh, yeah, great!

01:19:20.245 --> 01:19:22.547
Two grown men
to catch a four-pound dog.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.551
<i>Excuse me, boss?
I could use a hand here.</i>

01:19:26.584 --> 01:19:27.686
Finally got you.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.722
Got you, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

01:19:29.754 --> 01:19:31.623
- Good evening, officers.
- Good evening.

01:19:31.656 --> 01:19:33.726
Good evening.
Well, I must admit

01:19:33.758 --> 01:19:36.494
your enforcement program
has accomplished its goal.

01:19:36.528 --> 01:19:38.597
I see you have another one.

01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:42.935
- <i>I'd love a miracle right about now.</i>
- <i>I'll work on it.</i>

01:19:42.967 --> 01:19:49.007
You know, I haven't experienced any
surprises in weeks, so thank you.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.713
<i>Do you think you could throw in a
promotion for our fine officers,</i>

01:19:54.747 --> 01:20:00.319
<i>as an extra Christmas bonus for
your angel in training here?</i>

01:20:00.351 --> 01:20:02.721
<i>I need these guys
out of my hair.</i>

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:04.690
And because you've
taken care of this issue

01:20:04.722 --> 01:20:07.493
so efficiently
and with humanity

01:20:07.525 --> 01:20:10.462
towards some of our more
delicate residents,

01:20:10.495 --> 01:20:12.597
I'm recommending to the Chief

01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:16.769
that we put you back on full
police duty starting Monday.

01:20:16.802 --> 01:20:21.641
And, as a Christmas bonus,
you are off-duty as of now.

01:20:21.673 --> 01:20:25.444
So, go visit your families,
spend some time,

01:20:25.476 --> 01:20:27.747
or come and help us finish
the home for the veterans.

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:29.614
Sure, yeah.
Most grateful, ma'am.

01:20:29.647 --> 01:20:31.617
Yeah, Merry Christmas, ma'am.
It's been a pleasure to serve.

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:33.419
We just have one
more charge to turn in.

01:20:33.452 --> 01:20:36.055
Oh! What happened
to the offender?

01:20:36.087 --> 01:20:38.690
- I don't really know.
- Oh, well...

01:20:38.723 --> 01:20:40.059
Not our charge anymore?

01:20:40.092 --> 01:20:43.329
Merry Christmas.

01:20:43.361 --> 01:20:45.397
Merry Christmas!

01:20:45.431 --> 01:20:48.467
- Where'd that... where'd that dog go?
- No idea.

01:20:48.499 --> 01:20:52.738
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:55.974
William, you may
now kiss your bride.

01:21:08.486 --> 01:21:09.721
Ta-da!

01:21:09.754 --> 01:21:11.757
Oh, my gosh, Kate,
how did you know?

01:21:11.789 --> 01:21:13.926
Well, you know, I thought
you had a lot on your mind,

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:16.494
and when I found the detailed
list from the wedding planner,

01:21:16.528 --> 01:21:18.364
I just thought,
"I'm gonna help you out."

01:21:18.396 --> 01:21:19.631
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:21:19.664 --> 01:21:21.466
Oh, my gosh,
Will looked so happy

01:21:21.499 --> 01:21:23.868
and he would have been so
disappointed if this was a huge flub.

01:21:23.901 --> 01:21:25.671
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:25.704 --> 01:21:27.606
- Gorgeous cake!
- Thank you.

01:21:27.638 --> 01:21:28.740
It is what made us famous.

01:21:45.123 --> 01:21:48.626
Why don't you ask her to dance
before you lose your nerve?

01:21:48.659 --> 01:21:51.629
I don't have a nerve.
I've been so anxious to see her,

01:21:51.663 --> 01:21:54.567
and she's so beautiful,
I don't know what to say.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.468
Just say, "Hey, would you
like to dance?"

01:21:56.502 --> 01:21:58.104
It's a real icebreaker.

01:21:58.137 --> 01:22:00.072
I'm not too good
at dancing.

01:22:00.105 --> 01:22:01.841
Want me to give you
a quick lesson?

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:03.809
No, I'm going in.

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:06.878
- May I cut in?
- Thank you.

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:12.985
I'm glad you could come.
How was your flight?

01:22:13.017 --> 01:22:14.453
Long.

01:22:14.485 --> 01:22:16.756
Well, I think
you're very pretty,

01:22:16.788 --> 01:22:18.523
and I like the dress.

01:22:20.559 --> 01:22:22.494
Thank you,
but as these things go,

01:22:22.528 --> 01:22:23.896
it's the bride's choice.

01:22:23.928 --> 01:22:25.998
I'll say.

01:22:37.575 --> 01:22:39.744
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:39.778 --> 01:22:42.815
Christine and I are honored to
share our special day with you.

01:22:42.847 --> 01:22:46.185
It's wonderful to have
both our families here and...

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:50.755
Oh, my gosh! Hank Wentworth and
his new friend, Hilde Becker!

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:53.626
Thank you all for doing this!

01:22:53.659 --> 01:22:55.928
It's so good to see
you in good health, man.

01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:04.170
Congratulations.

01:23:04.203 --> 01:23:06.004
You too.

01:23:07.071 --> 01:23:09.675
You're up now.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.610
- We'll be dancing.
- We'll be dancing.

01:24:00.926 --> 01:24:02.662
Hello! Come in!

01:24:04.296 --> 01:24:05.731
- Hi.
- Hey, Jimmy.

01:24:05.763 --> 01:24:07.199
It's nice seeing you.

01:24:07.231 --> 01:24:10.602
- It's cold.
- Yeah.

01:24:10.636 --> 01:24:13.739
I can't believe you guys
have done that in less than a month.

01:24:13.771 --> 01:24:15.039
Someone could
live there already.

01:24:15.073 --> 01:24:17.243
We are one city
inspection away

01:24:17.275 --> 01:24:20.645
from a ribbon cutting
or something.

01:24:20.678 --> 01:24:22.714
But who is living
in those houses?

01:24:22.748 --> 01:24:25.851
To start with,
it's gonna be Hank and Captain Jack.

01:24:25.883 --> 01:24:29.921
And they'll be able to live there
and get their lives back in order.

01:24:29.954 --> 01:24:31.856
And in a year or so,
they'll be moving on

01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:33.892
and we'll have
some new vets move in.

01:24:33.926 --> 01:24:35.561
So, we're not leaving
any comrades

01:24:35.593 --> 01:24:38.029
on the battlefield,
so to speak.

01:24:38.062 --> 01:24:41.165
The homeless situation
is really complicated.

01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:44.603
And the homeless
veterans situation

01:24:44.636 --> 01:24:46.638
is twice as complicated.

01:24:46.672 --> 01:24:48.007
Well, why is that?

01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:51.310
We send men
and women off to war,

01:24:51.342 --> 01:24:57.048
and they see just horrendous things in
the battles and places that they go,

01:24:57.082 --> 01:24:59.752
stuff that we can't even
really imagine.

01:24:59.784 --> 01:25:01.287
When they come home,

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.157
society cannot even
understand their situation.

01:25:05.190 --> 01:25:08.761
Vets hurt
in a very different way.

01:25:08.793 --> 01:25:12.330
Yeah, my dad has some of that.
It can be scary.

01:25:12.364 --> 01:25:15.067
Yeah. Well, I'm glad to see
that he's feeling better.

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.303
Giving him a sense of purpose
has really helped in his healing.

01:25:18.337 --> 01:25:22.074
Oh, Mr. Masters sent me here
for an extra credit project.

01:25:22.106 --> 01:25:24.276
- You want to check it out?
- Sure!

01:25:25.944 --> 01:25:27.213
It's this one
right here.

01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:32.617
Ah! This looks
interesting.

01:25:38.623 --> 01:25:40.059
- Hey, darling.
- Hey!

01:25:41.293 --> 01:25:46.231
I brought you
some hot chocolate.

01:25:46.263 --> 01:25:47.999
Oh, Southern style?

01:25:48.033 --> 01:25:49.602
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

01:25:49.635 --> 01:25:51.169
That's great.

01:25:51.203 --> 01:25:52.138
Mm-hmm.

01:25:53.137 --> 01:25:55.807
Mm. Yeah.

01:25:55.841 --> 01:25:58.744
- That is Southern style.
- Yeah.

01:25:58.776 --> 01:26:00.178
I've been doing
some thinking.

01:26:00.212 --> 01:26:01.946
Uh-oh.

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.383
Yeah, I've been, uh...

01:26:04.415 --> 01:26:06.885
I've been reminded of late

01:26:06.918 --> 01:26:11.156
about when your dad returned
from his tour in Korea.

01:26:12.289 --> 01:26:15.260
I remember y'all talking
about Korea.

01:26:15.293 --> 01:26:18.364
Yeah, he found it
difficult to...

01:26:18.396 --> 01:26:22.767
to reunite with people
at home, even with you.

01:26:22.801 --> 01:26:25.137
You know, he had
a ringing in his ear,

01:26:25.169 --> 01:26:27.373
and it hurt
when people talked to him,

01:26:27.405 --> 01:26:29.841
and his head hurt.

01:26:29.874 --> 01:26:33.745
He didn't know how
to make you understand.

01:26:33.779 --> 01:26:36.115
It wasn't you that he was
pulling away from.

01:26:38.984 --> 01:26:41.352
- You know what he did?
- No. What'd he do?

01:26:41.386 --> 01:26:45.691
- Your daddy took you fishing.
- Fishing! Oh!

01:26:45.723 --> 01:26:48.060
Yeah. I love fishing
and he did too.

01:26:48.092 --> 01:26:50.261
- We had a great time.
- Uh-uh.

01:26:50.294 --> 01:26:53.031
- Huh?
- Actually, he didn't.

01:26:53.065 --> 01:26:54.867
What?! He didn't love fishing?

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.235
- No.
- Oh.

01:26:56.267 --> 01:27:00.004
No, no. What he did is
he found a place

01:27:00.038 --> 01:27:04.243
where you and he could
reconnect by being quiet.

01:27:04.275 --> 01:27:06.811
- Mm-hmm.
- Got to be quiet because...

01:27:06.845 --> 01:27:09.815
- You can't scare the fish.
- That's right!

01:27:09.847 --> 01:27:13.685
So, let you do the fishing,
while he did the reconnecting.

01:27:13.718 --> 01:27:16.254
And it made him so happy.
You know why?

01:27:16.288 --> 01:27:18.323
Because you were
off together,

01:27:18.355 --> 01:27:20.191
and you were doing
the thing that you loved.

01:27:20.225 --> 01:27:22.327
Mm-hmm.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.230
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, you bet.

01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:28.367
Merry Christmas.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.270
You've come a
long way since we've met.

01:27:31.302 --> 01:27:33.004
You know, I think
building these houses

01:27:33.038 --> 01:27:35.074
has been the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:27:35.106 --> 01:27:36.874
I've got
my civilian skills back,

01:27:36.908 --> 01:27:40.345
and I really feeling like
I've been contributing.

01:27:40.378 --> 01:27:43.282
Taking action is a huge step
in the right direction.

01:27:45.217 --> 01:27:48.320
I want to invite you to the
completion party tomorrow.

01:27:48.352 --> 01:27:50.756
It would be really important
to me if you meet my family.

01:27:50.788 --> 01:27:53.157
And I think they deserve
to meet the person

01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:55.226
that's helped me out
so much.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:58.262
It's my way of thanking you
for your years of service.

01:27:58.296 --> 01:28:01.100
And I want to personally
thank you

01:28:01.132 --> 01:28:04.001
for helping the vets
that I can't reach.

01:28:04.034 --> 01:28:05.336
Anytime, Doc.

01:28:05.369 --> 01:28:07.205
Anytime here,
as well.

01:28:09.373 --> 01:28:10.775
You need me,
I'm here for you.

01:28:10.809 --> 01:28:13.345
You call me,
you stop in anytime, okay?

01:28:13.378 --> 01:28:15.080
Okay.

01:28:15.113 --> 01:28:16.315
So, you going
to come tomorrow?

01:28:16.347 --> 01:28:17.850
It's gonna be fun.

01:28:19.016 --> 01:28:20.019
Remember fun?

01:28:21.019 --> 01:28:23.254
Okay! I'll be there.

01:28:23.288 --> 01:28:24.990
Okay, good.

01:28:25.022 --> 01:28:27.059
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye, John.

01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:34.800
It is
with the greatest pleasure

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:38.137
that we can dedicate
these new homes

01:28:38.169 --> 01:28:40.305
before the holiday season.

01:28:40.337 --> 01:28:44.142
From the impossible
to the livable,

01:28:44.176 --> 01:28:47.812
all within a month,
is a miracle!

01:28:47.846 --> 01:28:50.915
- Y'all...
- Ho-ho-ho! Hello, everyone!

01:28:50.949 --> 01:28:54.119
Merry Christmas to all!

01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:55.820
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:28:55.854 --> 01:28:58.222
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:28:58.256 --> 01:29:00.126
Ho-ho-ho!

01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:06.430
Hi, how are you?

01:29:06.463 --> 01:29:08.266
- Dr. Warren.
- John!

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.301
Please,
meet my wife Jill.

01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:10.568
Oh, Jill!

01:29:10.601 --> 01:29:12.470
- This is the doctor.
- Dr. Warren.

01:29:12.503 --> 01:29:13.538
It's so good to meet you.

01:29:29.587 --> 01:29:31.055
Mommy,
what's wrong?

01:29:31.088 --> 01:29:33.124
Who is that man
looking at us?

01:29:33.158 --> 01:29:35.427
He's looking at me.

01:29:38.195 --> 01:29:41.867
He doesn't know about
my favorite little elf yet.

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:45.304
That man is your grandpa.

01:29:45.337 --> 01:29:47.173
My grandpa?

01:29:48.239 --> 01:29:51.042
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Shelby.

01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:54.212
His name is Henry.

01:30:07.158 --> 01:30:09.428
Henry, is it?

01:30:09.461 --> 01:30:11.997
Do you know that my name
is Henry too?

01:30:12.029 --> 01:30:14.599
I know. Mommy
told me about you,

01:30:14.632 --> 01:30:16.501
and that's how
I got my name.

01:30:16.534 --> 01:30:18.971
Oh, good!

01:30:19.003 --> 01:30:20.404
Do you like Santa Claus?

01:30:20.437 --> 01:30:23.908
Not as much
as meeting my grandpa.

01:30:30.949 --> 01:30:33.218
Thank you so much
for what you've done for us.

01:30:33.251 --> 01:30:35.020
Thank you for your service
to our country.

01:30:35.052 --> 01:30:36.587
We appreciate you.

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.290
And we have a special gift for
you, my friend.

01:30:39.324 --> 01:30:42.461
For as long as you need
it, it's yours.

01:30:42.494 --> 01:30:44.897
A new home.
God bless you.

01:30:50.302 --> 01:30:52.905
Captain Jack.
You've given a lot to us.

01:30:52.937 --> 01:30:54.172
You've given us
a great gift.

01:30:54.204 --> 01:30:55.239
You've protected
our country,

01:30:55.272 --> 01:30:57.441
you've protected
our freedoms,

01:30:57.475 --> 01:30:59.977
and I'm going to tell you the same
thing, my friend.

01:31:00.011 --> 01:31:02.214
For as long as you need
it, it's yours.

01:31:02.247 --> 01:31:04.348
A new home.
God bless you too.

01:31:04.382 --> 01:31:06.184
God bless you.

01:31:09.387 --> 01:31:13.225
How about a Merry Christmas
for all of these fine veterans?

01:31:13.257 --> 01:31:14.392
Merry Christmas!

01:31:14.426 --> 01:31:17.062
Thank you so much!

01:31:17.095 --> 01:31:18.597
Now, who wants
a candy cane?

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:23.200
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:31:23.234 --> 01:31:24.535
Good to see you.

01:31:32.644 --> 01:31:34.113
A bathroom.

01:31:40.985 --> 01:31:43.488
- Baby sis.
- Hey, big bro!

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:46.257
- How'd you get here?
- I flew.

01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:47.659
Come here.

01:31:47.691 --> 01:31:51.128
- Man.
- Oh, man, I missed you.

01:31:51.162 --> 01:31:52.564
Oh, I missed you too.

01:31:52.596 --> 01:31:55.733
Will you marry me?

01:31:55.766 --> 01:31:58.436
I have nothing.

01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:01.039
Nothing to give you.

01:32:01.071 --> 01:32:02.606
To give me?

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.544
Sweetheart, you have
already given me so much.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:12.216
<i>So, Charlie, looks like
everyone got their Christmas wish.</i>

01:32:12.249 --> 01:32:14.118
<i>What about you?</i>

01:32:14.151 --> 01:32:16.555
<i>Well,
what I wish for...</i>

01:32:16.587 --> 01:32:19.123
<i>I wish everyone had
a home for Christmas,</i>

01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:21.459
<i>two paws and four paws.</i>

01:32:53.525 --> 01:32:56.728
I gave Jimmy the task to
figure out what it would cost

01:32:56.761 --> 01:33:01.066
to solve the problem of homeless
veterans in our country.

01:33:02.232 --> 01:33:03.735
What did you
come up with?

01:33:03.767 --> 01:33:09.040
So, the population of the USA
is 327 million people.

01:33:09.074 --> 01:33:12.411
It takes about $55,000
to build one house.

01:33:12.444 --> 01:33:15.547
And there's about 40,000
homeless vets

01:33:15.579 --> 01:33:17.582
living in the street
and in their cars.

01:33:19.516 --> 01:33:22.053
If we multiply
how many vets by the cost,

01:33:22.087 --> 01:33:24.823
we get $2 billion.
And that's a lot of money.

01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:26.624
How did you get
to that figure?

01:33:35.867 --> 01:33:38.570
Well, if you take $2 billion

01:33:38.602 --> 01:33:41.138
and divide it by how many people
live in the United States,

01:33:41.172 --> 01:33:43.708
we get $6.63.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:46.677
- And that we can do.
- Great job!

01:36:39.883 --> 01:36:41.285
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

01:36:41.319 --> 01:36:42.520
- There's this crack.
- All right.

01:36:42.552 --> 01:36:44.355
I see you got
a nasty one here.

01:36:44.388 --> 01:36:45.789
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:36:45.823 --> 01:36:47.926
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:36:47.958 --> 01:36:49.760
- Can you take care of that?
- Yeah, yeah. That will be no problem.

01:36:49.793 --> 01:36:51.328
Sure. Cool.

01:36:51.361 --> 01:36:53.397
Thank you, sir.
I'll go and get started.

01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:55.400
All right, we got it
taken care of.

01:36:55.432 --> 01:36:56.400
- Looks good, looks good.
- Sure thing.

01:36:56.434 --> 01:36:57.636
Yes, sir,
thank you so much.

01:36:57.668 --> 01:37:00.337
Definitely. Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

01:37:22.827 --> 01:37:26.330
Mommy's gonna like
this new windscreen, huh?

01:37:26.364 --> 01:37:28.734
Oh, she's gonna
be happy.

01:37:30.334 --> 01:37:31.569
Oh, yeah.

01:37:35.558 --> 01:37:40.558
