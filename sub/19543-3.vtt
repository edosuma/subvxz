WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:11.836
Goku was powerless against the
might of his Saiyan brother, Raditz.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.466
--Father!
--Whoa, there!

00:14.556 --> 00:18.174
Kakarrot, I have your child.

00:18.268 --> 00:22.386
If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

00:22.481 --> 00:26.099
Will he be able to get Gohan back?

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.279 --> 01:59.026
"A Life-or-Death Battle! Goku anol
Piccolo 's Ferocious Suicide Attack. "

02:01.330 --> 02:03.662
If you're just finding out
how fearsome a Saiyan is,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.330
it's already too late.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.953
For those who still defy me

02:07.044 --> 02:12.255
after I've gone to the trouble of
warning them, there is only death!

02:12.341 --> 02:13.501
He's got us.

02:13.592 --> 02:17.084
To think that there are even
stronger guys than him out there.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.842
It's exciting, isn't it, Son Goku?

02:20.933 --> 02:24.926
Sorry, but this time, I ain't feeling excited.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.057
I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

02:28.148 --> 02:33.438
It's only natural. But that terror
will soon be turning to despair.

02:33.529 --> 02:38.193
Never mind me, where is my son?!
Where did you hide him?!

02:38.283 --> 02:42.401
I haven't hidden him. He was just
wailing so loud, I locked him up.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.909
You see that hole behind you? He's in there.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.713
Over there?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.665
Gohan...

02:56.760 --> 03:01.925
Father! Help me! Father!

03:02.015 --> 03:07.009
Just sit tight, Gohan! Daddy will
help you out of there right away!

03:08.981 --> 03:11.142
Don't be ridiculous!

03:11.233 --> 03:14.100
There's no way you can help him!

03:14.194 --> 03:17.937
Not when you guys are going to die first!

03:20.158 --> 03:22.410
All right, let's do it!

03:22.494 --> 03:24.951
We don't have any other choice!

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.145 --> 03:49.806
Behind me!

04:08.498 --> 04:10.079
Yikes!

04:19.635 --> 04:22.000
W-Where did you go?!

04:22.095 --> 04:23.801
Right here.

04:35.317 --> 04:40.186
D-Damn! A-Are you all right, Piccolo?!

04:42.991 --> 04:47.985
R-Relax. I can still manage
to fight with one arm.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.161
It looks like your deaths are drawing near!

04:56.838 --> 05:01.832
Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new moves up your sleeve?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.419
Sorry, but to be honest, I ain't got any.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.220
You've been slacking.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.515
And here, I've been training earnestly,
developing a new move.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.638
What are you whispering about?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.015
Whatever strategy you
come up with, it won't work!

05:15.107 --> 05:19.350
It'd be easier on you if
you just croaked right away.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.230
Can you do it with only one arm?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.232
Yeah, that part's all right.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.908
But it takes quite a bit of time
to build up the Ki for this move.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.287
While I do, you fight him by yourself,

05:32.374 --> 05:34.080
and keep his attention drawn.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.953
You got it.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.663
I had been saving this to kill you with.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.545
And now, you might just
end up saving me with it, huh?

05:44.636 --> 05:49.221
If I'm able to kill him with it,
your turn will come next.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.684
All right, I can't wait to see it!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.145
Now, let's see if I can keep him bottled up!

06:22.841 --> 06:25.173
You sure are persistent!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.046
Ka...

06:27.137 --> 06:29.469
......me

06:29.556 --> 06:32.047
His battle power is going up!

06:32.142 --> 06:34.224
...ha...

06:34.311 --> 06:36.643
......me

06:39.483 --> 06:45.820
A-And his battle power is 1,020!
Unbelievable! It's still going up!

06:47.532 --> 06:50.023
...Ha!!

06:58.126 --> 07:00.742
You've got some nerve!

07:17.229 --> 07:19.971
H-He caught it!

07:21.900 --> 07:25.017
l have a present for you, now!

07:39.584 --> 07:41.415
Die!

07:46.383 --> 07:49.591
Battle power 1,330...!

07:49.678 --> 07:52.636
H-He's concentrated all of his battle power

07:52.722 --> 07:54.929
into his fingertips!

07:55.016 --> 07:59.851
D-Damn! These guys are able to
manipulate their power at will!

07:59.938 --> 08:03.897
Take this on! Makankosappo!!

08:35.849 --> 08:39.136
H-He dodged it!

08:39.227 --> 08:42.719
To think that you'd injure me...

08:42.813 --> 08:45.430
You'll pay for that!

08:53.617 --> 08:56.575
See you in Hell!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.541
You dropped your guard, huh?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.336
Now I've got your tail!

09:11.468 --> 09:14.551
W-When did you manage to...

09:14.638 --> 09:17.721
Piccolo! Now! Do that thing again!

09:17.807 --> 09:21.391
You've outdone yourself, Goku!
Hold onto that tail tightly!

09:21.478 --> 09:24.265
I can only use this technique one more time!

09:24.356 --> 09:30.192
K-Kakarrot, y-you would kill your only brother?

09:30.278 --> 09:35.363
Shut up! I told you, anyone as
cruel as you are ain't my brother!

09:35.450 --> 09:37.941
Don't you talk about yourself like that,

09:38.036 --> 09:39.776
not after you were about to kill me!

09:39.871 --> 09:43.329
I-I'll stop! I've had a change of heart!

09:43.416 --> 09:46.499
I'll leave this planet without any more trouble!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.702
Don't fall for it, Son Goku!

09:48.797 --> 09:50.879
He doesn't mean what he's saying!

09:50.966 --> 09:54.458
There's no way he's going to do that!

09:54.552 --> 09:57.885
P-Please, believe me, my brother!

09:57.973 --> 10:01.386
Sure, I've done a lot of
terrible things up to now,

10:01.476 --> 10:07.722
i-including to you. But I will
keep my promise to you!

10:07.816 --> 10:09.272
Y-You mean it?

10:09.359 --> 10:12.442
I-I mean it!

10:13.530 --> 10:17.990
N-No! Don't let go of his tail! That's his ploy!

10:19.661 --> 10:23.825
Please, Kakarrot! Believe me!

10:28.545 --> 10:30.661
Son Goku!

10:45.228 --> 10:51.269
You hapless fool! It's rare to
find anyone as dumb as you!

10:51.359 --> 10:54.317
T-That was dirty!

10:54.404 --> 10:57.942
But I'm not like you.
I am a first-class warrior!

10:58.033 --> 11:00.274
I won't hesitate for a moment to kill you,

11:00.368 --> 11:02.745
even if you are my brother!

11:02.829 --> 11:06.617
You want me to show you
what I'm talking about? Hmm?

11:08.251 --> 11:11.459
Suffer some more! Your death is near!

11:13.590 --> 11:17.424
What's the matter?
Do that thing you did earlier!

11:18.887 --> 11:22.425
H-He'll just avoid it again like this!

11:29.356 --> 11:30.937
What?!

11:50.043 --> 11:54.161
W... What's this?!

11:54.255 --> 11:55.506
Impossible...

11:55.590 --> 11:58.457
G-Gohan...?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.918
R-Run away, Gohan...

12:02.013 --> 12:04.299
Run away!

12:08.103 --> 12:13.848
B-Battle power... 1,307?!

12:17.779 --> 12:19.315
Stop picking on...

12:19.406 --> 12:25.072
m H
her..
y fat

12:36.714 --> 12:38.375
Ow!

12:38.466 --> 12:41.208
G-Gohan...

12:41.302 --> 12:43.964
Father!

12:44.055 --> 12:46.797
D-Did you...?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.803
F-Father...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.599
Y-You little brat!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.772
R-Ru n away!

12:58.194 --> 13:01.186
Gohan, run away!

13:01.281 --> 13:04.444
Run away! Hurry!

13:04.534 --> 13:10.325
N-Now his battle power is just â€™I?

13:10.415 --> 13:15.910
I-It changes completely,
together with his feelings.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.336
Run away!

13:19.799 --> 13:22.006
Gohan!

13:23.094 --> 13:25.255
Gohan!

13:29.893 --> 13:33.351
S-Stop! Don't do it! He's just...

13:33.438 --> 13:36.805
Just a child, is that what you're telling me?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.356
You've got to be kidding.

13:38.443 --> 13:42.812
That kid has a battle power
far higher than you two.

13:42.906 --> 13:46.569
I'll kill him now, before he becomes
able to better use his power.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.407
Don't worry, though.
I'll reunite you soon enough.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.114
In the next world, that is.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.006
Wait!

14:08.306 --> 14:14.597
You're the first one to ever
do this much damage to me.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.978
But this is where it ends!

14:25.448 --> 14:27.359
Die!

14:29.577 --> 14:31.533
W-Why, you!

14:32.580 --> 14:33.820
Piccolo!

14:33.915 --> 14:37.954
Quick! That technique from before!

14:38.044 --> 14:41.457
I've been getting it ready,
thinking this might be coming!

14:41.548 --> 14:46.133
But I'll need... a little more time!

14:47.470 --> 14:49.836
Piccolo! H urry!

14:49.931 --> 14:52.343
Make it quick!

14:52.433 --> 14:55.391
Let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

14:55.478 --> 14:59.346
With us stuck together, you won't
come out unharmed, either!

15:01.234 --> 15:03.816
Then I'll die right along with you.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.110
W-What did you say?!

15:06.197 --> 15:08.062
A-Are you out of your mind?!

15:08.157 --> 15:11.945
There ain't any other way to defeat you!

15:13.705 --> 15:15.366
Son Goku...

15:15.456 --> 15:18.664
I'm not going to hold back!

15:18.751 --> 15:24.747
Nothing would be better than
having you out of the picture, too!

15:24.841 --> 15:28.834
L-Let me go! H was wrong!

15:28.928 --> 15:31.795
I won't ever come to this planet again!

15:31.889 --> 15:34.972
Y-You're not going to trick me again!

15:35.059 --> 15:39.928
It's no lie! D-Don't you trust
your own brother's word?!

15:40.023 --> 15:43.481
Piccolo! Hurry it up!

15:47.947 --> 15:50.984
Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready?

15:51.075 --> 15:53.407
Do it!

15:53.494 --> 15:55.576
Take this!

15:55.663 --> 15:57.494
Wait!

15:57.582 --> 16:00.665
Makankosappo!!

16:21.522 --> 16:25.515
D-Damn it all!

16:47.256 --> 16:56.972
D-Damn! To think that I would be...
d-done in... by these guys...

16:57.058 --> 17:01.927
I-Imagine, Kakarrot...

17:02.021 --> 17:06.560
...g-giving up his... own life...

17:06.651 --> 17:09.563
Son Goku can be brought
back to life in no time.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.645
What?!

17:11.739 --> 17:15.732
On this planet, we have some
nice things we call Dragon Balls.

17:15.827 --> 17:20.195
By making a request to them,
any wish you desire is possible.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.156
Even bringing the dead back to life.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.789
D-Damn...

17:28.172 --> 17:33.257
Still, I'm glad you told me that.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.088
This entire situation up to now

17:39.183 --> 17:45.600
has been transmitted to my two
companions, far away in outer space.

17:45.690 --> 17:51.310
--What?
--W-When they learn I've been beaten, they...

17:53.406 --> 17:56.819
...they're sure to be coming here...

17:57.994 --> 18:01.737
They'll sweep not just you,

18:01.831 --> 18:04.413
but everyone on this planet,

18:04.500 --> 18:09.585
away in the... blink of an eye...

18:09.672 --> 18:12.129
T-Those... two guys...

18:12.216 --> 18:15.754
W-When will they... get here...?

18:15.845 --> 18:20.134
One year... Just one year...

18:23.811 --> 18:29.556
In one year, two more of you,
who are even stronger...

18:29.650 --> 18:33.188
It was a short-lived celebration, huh...?

18:36.324 --> 18:42.035
You guys are no more than worms after all...

18:53.049 --> 18:55.665
You can rest in peace now.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.469
You had to go and open your big mouth.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.226
Son Goku, he's dead.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.519
Ah! There are a few of them down!

19:08.606 --> 19:10.562
W-Who's that still standing?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.515
It's Piccolo!

19:15.488 --> 19:18.230
Raditz is dead.

19:18.324 --> 19:22.363
Seriously, how pathetic.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.738
To think that he was killed

19:23.830 --> 19:26.867
by guys whose battle power
was just over a thousand.

19:26.958 --> 19:31.327
What do we do? Put this planet
on hold, and go there?

19:31.420 --> 19:36.335
They did say something... interesting, huh?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.381
About "Dragon Balls" or whatever.

19:38.469 --> 19:42.132
Yeah. Supposedly, they grant any wish.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.588
All right, let's go.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.174
We're going to bring Raditz back to life, right?

19:46.269 --> 19:51.138
You must be joking. We don't
need that useless guy anymore.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.187
How does this sound?

19:55.278 --> 19:59.942
We never grow any older, and gain eternal life?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.899
By doing that, we'll be able
to enjoy fighting forever.

20:02.994 --> 20:06.703
I get you. That would be great!

20:10.209 --> 20:11.995
And that's how it happened.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.747
H see.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.705
Goku! Goku, I say!

20:16.799 --> 20:19.791
Hey, Goku! Stay with me!

20:19.886 --> 20:24.175
Gohan-kun is all right. He's just unconscious.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.973
Thank... goodness...

20:28.060 --> 20:30.517
--He's coming to!
--Goku!

20:30.605 --> 20:35.065
...I won't have to have Chichi yell at me.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.187
Son-kun...

20:42.867 --> 20:45.233
K-Kuririn...

20:45.328 --> 20:51.619
Dying is... pretty... n-nasty, huh?

20:51.709 --> 20:55.827
W-What are you talking about,
Goku?! Get hold of yourself!

20:55.922 --> 20:57.537
This isn't like you!

20:57.632 --> 21:03.298
L-Looks like this time, at least, I'm done for.

21:03.387 --> 21:07.801
D-Don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

21:09.560 --> 21:13.894
P-Please do...

21:17.818 --> 21:19.558
Goku...

21:19.654 --> 21:21.610
GokuII

21:21.697 --> 21:25.906
Goku sacrificed his own life to defeat Raditz.

21:25.993 --> 21:30.578
However, a new enemy
is now closing in on Earth!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:33.811 --> 22:35.096
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:35.187 --> 22:37.929
Wow, I died in a hurry, huh?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.857
What? You don't want to go to Heaven?

22:40.943 --> 22:42.399
Great King Yama!

22:42.486 --> 22:45.899
Hmm, you're going to train unoler Kaio?

22:45.990 --> 22:49.198
Don't blame me if you fall
off the Serpentine Road.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.900
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:50.995 --> 22:54.487
"Run in the Next World, Son Goku!
The Million-Kilo-Long Serpentine Road. "

22:54.582 --> 22:59.827
Father! I'm scared of my green uncle!
