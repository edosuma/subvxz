00:00.094 --> 00:01.631
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.655 --> 00:03.383
Grandma and Grandpa have
money invested in this house.

00:03.408 --> 00:05.024
We need to sell it to pay them back.

00:05.060 --> 00:06.409
- Who's that?
- Aaron.

00:06.444 --> 00:10.021
- Should I be worried about this guy?
- No, we're texting about Kyle.

00:10.046 --> 00:11.678
Callie: The JJC is not taking his case.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.536
Aaron: Let's say we
find this curb painter.

00:13.571 --> 00:14.865
What's the plan? Walk
up to them and ask,

00:14.889 --> 00:17.540
"Hey, by any chance, did you
kill an old lady four years ago?"

00:17.575 --> 00:19.809
Mariana: I took some
of Jesus's ADHD pills.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.811
- Why?
- To stay up. To stay focused.

00:21.863 --> 00:23.824
- Promise me you won't take any more.
- I won't. I promise.

00:23.848 --> 00:26.799
Are you still upset about
what I told your dad?

00:26.835 --> 00:29.619
His moms are blaming him for
everything that happened with Callie.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.335
What do they mean everything
that happened with Callie?

00:31.360 --> 00:32.772
They had sex.

00:32.807 --> 00:35.374
Promise me that you will not
hold back on this audition

00:35.410 --> 00:37.404
because you feel that you have
an obligation to this girl.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.762
It's your business if you
wanna buy pot for your son,

00:39.814 --> 00:41.842
but I don't want him giving
any more of it to my brother.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.507
I'm never gonna tell you anything again.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.195
So just stay out of my life.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.648
We have an offer on the house, and we'll
have to be out by the end of the month.

00:49.891 --> 00:52.470
There are a couple of things that
we need to talk to you all about.

00:52.494 --> 00:54.796
But first of all, we would like
to know who this belongs to.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.824
- Jesus: Don't look at me.
- Mariana: It's not mine.

00:57.476 --> 00:58.664
What is it?

00:58.700 --> 01:00.320
It's a pipe for smoking marijuana.

01:00.418 --> 01:01.418
Callie?

01:02.670 --> 01:03.859
It's not mine.

01:03.884 --> 01:06.007
Okay, well, I found it in
one of the boxes in the garage

01:06.032 --> 01:07.801
where you've been spending
a lot of time lately.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.826
You are welcome to drug test me.

01:09.861 --> 01:10.921
Okay.

01:12.078 --> 01:13.094
Maybe it belongs to Gabe.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.462
No, no way.

01:15.164 --> 01:17.348
Okay, there's something else
that we need to tell you.

01:17.383 --> 01:19.896
What? We made a boatload on the
yard sale and don't have to move?

01:19.921 --> 01:21.118
Yeah, no thanks to you.

01:21.234 --> 01:23.170
- Me?
- Yeah, you sat on your ass all day.

01:23.206 --> 01:25.473
- Callie disappeared, like, all day.
- Hello.

01:25.525 --> 01:27.102
Sorry I had to work
on my senior project.

01:27.126 --> 01:28.109
Which was pretty convenient.

01:28.144 --> 01:29.471
- You did nothing.
- I did more than anybody.

01:29.495 --> 01:31.312
Oh, I'm sorry. I had a nail in my head.

01:31.314 --> 01:33.264
Mama and I are filing for divorce.

02:37.572 --> 02:39.134
Hey.

02:39.365 --> 02:41.198
I'm leaving now.

02:41.470 --> 02:43.284
You sure you don't want
a ride to the airport?

02:43.319 --> 02:45.319
Yeah, I'm sure. You sleep.

02:46.456 --> 02:48.289
You're gonna be brilliant.

02:51.327 --> 02:53.294
Tell Mason bye for me.

02:55.777 --> 02:57.142
Okay.

03:11.628 --> 03:12.628
I love you.

03:17.496 --> 03:18.720
I love you too.

03:37.256 --> 03:40.207
Knock, knock. Hello,
hello. Everyone decent?

03:40.209 --> 03:42.002
One of your brood said we could come up.

03:42.345 --> 03:43.266
Uh, "we"?

03:43.291 --> 03:45.346
I've got the client and their
contractor here with me.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.789
- We spoke yesterday.
- Uh, yeah, that's right. We did.

03:47.814 --> 03:51.650
Thanks so much. We're just in such
a time crunch with the baby coming.

03:52.271 --> 03:54.271
- I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
- Forgot?

03:54.307 --> 03:56.190
What we're thinking is
blowing this wall out

03:56.225 --> 03:58.253
and making the bedroom on
the other side a master bath.

03:58.277 --> 04:00.708
- Can we talk, please?
- Realtor: I think it's a great idea.

04:00.733 --> 04:02.649
You know, you could
make this a walk-in.

04:02.674 --> 04:04.557
- Oh, I love that.
- Yeah.

04:06.235 --> 04:09.753
Okay, seriously? Seriously? We have one
week to pack up this entire house, Lena.

04:09.778 --> 04:10.860
I didn't know what to say.

04:10.885 --> 04:13.240
You say no. They're already
rushing us out as it is.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.453
(scoffs) Would you stop fighting?

04:15.478 --> 04:17.805
Mariana, will you please
take the give-away

04:17.829 --> 04:19.829
box downstairs and put
it on the front porch?

04:19.855 --> 04:20.846
(sighs)

04:20.870 --> 04:23.167
Listen, we all have to help, okay?

04:23.252 --> 04:26.253
Okay, we'll, who's gonna help me
write a 20-page paper by Monday

04:26.255 --> 04:28.721
and raise $5,000 in
three weeks for Worlds?

04:31.807 --> 04:35.469
I am also stressed out because
right now, we have nowhere to live.

04:35.494 --> 04:36.735
I haven't found the right place yet.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.183
There's never gonna
be a right place, love.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.703
For now, we need a roof over our heads.

04:41.728 --> 04:44.548
Hey, would you all mind
since she's got her man here,

04:44.573 --> 04:47.080
if they just take a quick
peek at the kids' bath.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.392
Would we mind? Why would we mind?

04:52.025 --> 04:55.064
Okay... terrific.

04:55.447 --> 04:57.084
(phone ringing)

04:57.120 --> 05:00.393
Ugh! It's my soon-to-be
ex-husband. What?

05:01.393 --> 05:05.159
How am I supposed to pay any
bills when you froze our assets?

05:05.194 --> 05:06.947
Stef: Honey.

05:07.136 --> 05:10.988
You can keep dragging me back to this
house, but it's not getting cheaper.

05:11.134 --> 05:12.466
It's perfect.

05:12.783 --> 05:14.907
(sighs) We can't afford it, Lena.

05:14.932 --> 05:17.634
I spoke with my parents, and they
offered to give me my inheritance now

05:17.659 --> 05:19.008
that we could use for the down payment.

05:19.033 --> 05:20.291
Okay, and what about the mortgage?

05:20.343 --> 05:21.619
We can swing it.

05:22.426 --> 05:25.603
We could swing it, and then all
the kids could have their own rooms.

05:26.215 --> 05:29.517
So, we are adopting the twins?

05:29.908 --> 05:31.282
Well, space wouldn't be an issue.

05:31.307 --> 05:33.099
Yeah, but that's not
the only issue, Lena.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.090
It's our dream house.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.869
Can't you see us here?

05:38.244 --> 05:40.294
Raising our kids and growing old?

05:40.540 --> 05:41.540
Hmm?

05:43.099 --> 05:45.065
(whispering) Please.

05:45.101 --> 05:47.846
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.728
Please.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.527
- Okay.
- Oh!

05:55.002 --> 05:56.713
Oh, I love you so much.

05:56.918 --> 05:58.784
I love you too.

05:59.215 --> 06:00.998
(laughing)

06:18.253 --> 06:20.643
_

06:37.320 --> 06:39.136
Jude: Okay, I'll see you at school.

06:39.188 --> 06:40.437
Uh, wait.

06:43.109 --> 06:45.409
Here. Keep it.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.930
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

06:47.955 --> 06:49.788
It's cool. I want you to.

06:50.399 --> 06:51.988
(horn honks)

06:52.013 --> 06:53.200
Okay, see you.

06:55.187 --> 06:56.503
You have any garbage?

06:56.539 --> 06:57.539
What?

06:57.573 --> 06:58.573
Garbage?

06:59.575 --> 07:01.408
Oh.

07:01.748 --> 07:02.748
Yeah.

07:04.430 --> 07:07.248
You can probably sell
this at the yard sale.

07:07.283 --> 07:08.283
Whatever.

07:11.137 --> 07:13.053
Are you still mad at me about Noah?

07:15.224 --> 07:16.490
Jude, I don't deserve this.

07:16.525 --> 07:18.425
What do you deserve, Callie?

07:18.461 --> 07:20.621
Seeing that the only secrets
you can keep are your own.

07:26.151 --> 07:27.233
(phone beeps)

07:31.240 --> 07:33.880
_

07:36.246 --> 07:40.450
_

07:41.589 --> 07:45.442
_

07:46.305 --> 07:49.184
She's supposed to be the one that's in
charge of finding us a place to stay.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.141
How hard can that be?

07:51.177 --> 07:53.538
Well, there's a three-bedroom
apartment in my building for rent.

07:53.562 --> 07:56.080
Oh, that would be interesting.

07:56.115 --> 07:57.448
(phone ringing)

07:57.483 --> 07:59.133
Oh, it's B. It's B.

07:59.168 --> 08:00.445
Hey, buddy. I'm here with your
dad, and you're on speaker phone.

08:00.469 --> 08:02.369
Mike: Hey, B, how was your flight?

08:02.421 --> 08:03.354
Good.

08:03.389 --> 08:05.205
Stef: Are you in the city?

08:05.241 --> 08:07.224
Yeah, I just came out of the subway.

08:07.259 --> 08:09.193
I'm at, uh, Columbus Circle.

08:09.245 --> 08:10.305
Mike: Did you get lost yet?

08:10.549 --> 08:13.147
No one gets lost anymore,
Dad. I've got my phone.

08:13.182 --> 08:15.049
Headed to Lincoln Center.

08:15.084 --> 08:18.018
I'll call you when I'm
checked in and at the dorm.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.436
Mike: Okay, we're proud of you, B.

08:19.488 --> 08:20.421
Thanks, Dad.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.022
- Stef: Love you.
- Love you too.

09:13.568 --> 09:15.451
(bottles clink)

09:22.971 --> 09:23.971
AJ: Hey.

09:25.122 --> 09:26.388
Your boyfriend is here.

09:28.255 --> 09:30.003
There was other DNA on the murder weapon

09:30.027 --> 09:32.224
besides Martha Johnson's and Kyle's.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.521
Why didn't Kyle's lawyers ever see this?

09:34.546 --> 09:35.739
Because Detective Gray
didn't want him to.

09:35.932 --> 09:38.717
He used a private lab that
was shut down about a year ago

09:38.769 --> 09:41.130
because of allegations that they
doctored reports for the police

09:41.154 --> 09:42.755
to help them with their cases.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.255
Hey, how did you get that?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.825
Uh, the lab's database was
subpoenaed in another investigation,

09:46.850 --> 09:48.552
and I got them to let me take a look.

09:48.615 --> 09:51.683
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

09:52.076 --> 09:53.919
If we can place another
suspect at Martha

09:53.944 --> 09:55.894
Johnson's house on the
day she was murdered,

09:55.929 --> 09:57.829
someone who may have had a motive,

09:57.865 --> 10:00.888
then we might get a judge to
order them to give a DNA sample.

10:00.913 --> 10:02.897
Like our curb painter.

10:02.922 --> 10:04.528
Who's that?

10:05.029 --> 10:07.310
Um, there was a guy
painting addresses on

10:07.335 --> 10:10.069
people's curbs without their permission

10:10.094 --> 10:12.778
and then harassing them to pay.

10:12.803 --> 10:15.086
So we knocked on some doors.

10:15.150 --> 10:16.435
When was this?

10:16.901 --> 10:17.643
Um...

10:17.668 --> 10:19.869
After we told you to stop
harassing people yourself.

10:20.170 --> 10:21.849
- We didn't harass anyone.
- Callie...

10:21.874 --> 10:23.183
I'm almost finished
with my senior project,

10:23.207 --> 10:25.085
and you told me I could
go through the case file.

10:25.109 --> 10:26.942
But we did tell you to
stop playing detective.

10:26.977 --> 10:27.903
We didn't.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.536
I mean, we did find out where he lives,

10:30.561 --> 10:32.107
but we didn't knock on his door.

10:32.303 --> 10:34.270
- You know where he lives?
- Yeah.

10:34.585 --> 10:35.934
His name is Doug Harvey.

10:37.073 --> 10:38.940
What if you questioned him?

10:38.965 --> 10:42.622
If you could get him to admit to
painting Martha Johnson's curb,

10:43.035 --> 10:44.868
that might be all we need.

10:45.898 --> 10:48.445
- Right?
- Maybe.

11:10.380 --> 11:12.763
- Hi.
- Oh. Uh...

11:13.083 --> 11:15.140
I think I have the wrong room number.

11:15.192 --> 11:16.778
Is this 1584?

11:16.803 --> 11:18.193
- Um, yep.
- Yeah.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.771
- This... This is your room?
- Yeah.

11:20.988 --> 11:22.922
Okay, I guess they made a mistake then.

11:22.947 --> 11:24.136
You're auditioning?

11:24.263 --> 11:27.803
Yeah. Yeah, and they, uh,
assigned you as my roommate.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.474
Yeah, that happens a lot.

11:29.646 --> 11:30.662
What does?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.124
My name is Ariel, but I go by Ari,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.160
and sometimes, they think I'm a guy.

11:35.349 --> 11:37.145
Gotcha. Um...

11:37.197 --> 11:39.114
Okay, well, I guess I'll go tell them.

11:39.149 --> 11:41.622
- Sorry for the hassle.
- No, not your fault.

11:43.807 --> 11:44.807
(grunts)

11:46.006 --> 11:48.840
Whoa! Would you slow down?

11:49.594 --> 11:52.528
- Mariana!
- Sorry.

11:52.783 --> 11:55.651
I can't believe that Nick was
hiding up here. It freaks me out.

11:55.676 --> 11:58.144
I'm definitely not going up
in the attic. That's for sure.

11:58.168 --> 12:00.700
You haven't gone and
seen him again, have you?

12:00.725 --> 12:01.521
No.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.591
You should just tell him that you're
not his girlfriend anymore, you know.

12:04.616 --> 12:06.482
I will when he's better.

12:06.507 --> 12:07.552
He might not get better.

12:07.577 --> 12:10.177
Okay, can you stop talking about
it, please? It's stressing me out.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.429
What is that?

12:12.454 --> 12:13.770
It's Mom's journal.

12:14.184 --> 12:15.363
You mean Mama's journal?

12:15.388 --> 12:17.286
No. Stef's.

12:17.632 --> 12:19.833
Hey, well, you can't read that.

12:19.858 --> 12:21.708
If someone read my journal, I would die.

12:21.733 --> 12:22.859
Wait. You have a journal?

12:23.283 --> 12:24.283
No.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.037
Yeah, you're right. We
shouldn't be reading this.

12:33.938 --> 12:35.872
Okay, well, um...

12:36.033 --> 12:37.076
all this can go to the yard sale.

12:37.101 --> 12:38.927
Well, I'm not supposed
to be picking stuff up.

12:39.271 --> 12:40.232
I think you can handle it.

12:40.257 --> 12:41.247
(scoffs)

12:41.272 --> 12:44.708
You know, I'm at an increased
risk of having a seizure.

13:07.013 --> 13:09.552
Hey, we're supposed to be
packing stuff into boxes.

13:10.721 --> 13:12.357
How much of this have you read?

13:13.833 --> 13:16.513
Um, not much.

13:17.983 --> 13:20.302
Yeah, is that why you hid it from me?

13:20.327 --> 13:22.125
It's not a big deal.

13:24.363 --> 13:26.480
She didn't want to adopt
us. That's a pretty big deal.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.505
Mariana.

13:28.924 --> 13:29.939
You know what?

13:30.152 --> 13:31.218
I wanna leave this house.

13:31.253 --> 13:32.778
Between Nick and this,

13:32.803 --> 13:34.088
all of my good memories are ruined.

13:34.090 --> 13:36.023
So, here.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.424
What am I supposed to do with this?

13:40.449 --> 13:42.049
Burn it, for all I care.

14:13.343 --> 14:14.408
Nice place.

14:14.864 --> 14:16.786
The guy could use a gardener.

14:16.811 --> 14:18.192
And a Dumpster.

14:27.341 --> 14:29.193
- (dog barking)
- Man: Who is it?

14:29.228 --> 14:30.361
Stef: San Diego Police.

14:30.413 --> 14:32.552
We were hoping that we could
talk to you, Mr. Harvey.

14:36.859 --> 14:39.341
(dog continues barking)

14:43.380 --> 14:46.260
- You got a warrant?
- We're not here to search your home.

14:46.295 --> 14:49.196
You're on my property.
My property is my home.

14:49.231 --> 14:50.597
If you don't have a
warrant, you're trespassing.

14:50.622 --> 14:53.167
Relax. We just want to
ask you a few questions.

14:53.202 --> 14:56.954
We understand that you used to paint
addresses on curbs four years ago.

14:56.979 --> 15:01.214
I have a business
permit: 0-2-00-4-6-2-5-0.

15:01.239 --> 15:04.188
- 0-2-00-4-6-2-5-0.
- Take it easy.

15:04.419 --> 15:07.214
Yeah. We're not concerned
with that. Really. You're fine.

15:07.216 --> 15:10.184
We, uh, we wanted to know
if you knew Martha Johnson.

15:10.857 --> 15:11.652
Who?

15:11.677 --> 15:13.857
She lived about two blocks
from here, on Penn Street.

15:14.356 --> 15:16.290
You may have painted
her curb four years ago.

15:16.325 --> 15:17.755
I've painted a lot of curbs.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.163
Did you paint hers?

15:19.382 --> 15:20.622
I have no idea.

15:20.802 --> 15:22.263
Did you know that she was murdered?

15:22.779 --> 15:24.208
- No.
- Really?

15:24.233 --> 15:26.011
Because it, you know, happened
here in your neighborhood.

15:26.035 --> 15:27.880
I'm surprised you
didn't hear about that.

15:27.905 --> 15:29.870
I try to keep to myself.

15:29.922 --> 15:31.033
I don't really read the papers.

15:31.057 --> 15:33.810
Well, you seem to have
an awful lot of them.

15:33.835 --> 15:35.218
I pick up stuff.

15:35.344 --> 15:36.646
To recycle.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.245
- Oh.
- To organize.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.919
Gotcha. Makes sense.

15:40.149 --> 15:43.638
All right. Well, listen, if you
do happen to remember anything,

15:43.663 --> 15:46.103
this is my card. Please,
go ahead and call me.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.005
Okay? Thank you for
your time, Mr. Harvey.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.474
You have a good day.

15:49.729 --> 15:51.544
I'll get the door.

15:51.569 --> 15:52.569
Okay.

15:58.401 --> 16:00.028
What do you think?

16:00.119 --> 16:02.739
He's a nut-job, it doesn't
make him a murderer.

16:26.872 --> 16:29.982
So, did you figure out
your room situation?

16:30.794 --> 16:33.091
Uh... Yeah, I did.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.886
- Music?
- Yeah.

16:35.938 --> 16:37.938
- I thought so.
- Why?

16:37.940 --> 16:41.125
Well, um, you don't look like a dancer,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.060
and you don't act like an actor.

16:45.896 --> 16:47.131
Okay. How about you?

16:47.166 --> 16:48.716
- Dance.
- Oh.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.675
I would've thought drama.

16:50.750 --> 16:51.630
(chuckles)

16:51.655 --> 16:53.014
So, are you going out tonight?

16:53.038 --> 16:55.755
Uh... Well, I thought I'd
check out Times Square.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.096
Times Square.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.974
So, this is your first time in New York?

17:00.146 --> 17:02.062
Um, yeah. Why?

17:02.114 --> 17:05.999
Nothing. Um, just don't take any
pictures with anyone in a costume,

17:06.035 --> 17:07.078
unless you're willing to pay them.

17:07.102 --> 17:09.646
Some of them can get really aggressive.

17:09.817 --> 17:11.933
You know, I might just end
up walking around here...

17:11.957 --> 17:14.907
No. You have to go to
Times Square at least once.

17:14.944 --> 17:17.310
Um, I'm going to a party in Midtown.

17:17.313 --> 17:20.180
I can walk with you if
you want the company.

17:20.182 --> 17:22.132
Sounds like what I need is protection.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.067
(chuckles) I can offer that.

17:24.103 --> 17:26.970
Oh, really? I didn't know they had
martial arts in the dance program now.

17:26.994 --> 17:28.961
Okay. I'm tougher than I look.

17:29.008 --> 17:30.991
Hey, I wouldn't mess with you.

17:31.026 --> 17:32.583
That's too bad.

17:35.364 --> 17:38.513
Mm. You're so fancy, bringing me here.

17:38.901 --> 17:42.236
On the floor, the fancy rug.

17:42.238 --> 17:44.263
It's good for your back.

17:44.288 --> 17:46.067
- You're so thoughtful.
- What can I say?

17:46.091 --> 17:47.107
(both laugh)

17:53.083 --> 17:56.099
Yo, so, uh, what's the
story with this Aaron dude?

17:57.303 --> 17:58.614
What do you mean?

18:00.172 --> 18:02.864
He ever take you for a
ride on his motorcycle?

18:05.194 --> 18:08.061
- (chuckles)
- Seriously.

18:08.113 --> 18:09.963
How'd y'all meet?

18:11.317 --> 18:13.036
Why does it matter?

18:14.253 --> 18:16.147
Mike: The landlord gave
me the code to the lock-box,

18:16.171 --> 18:17.832
so I can show it for him
when he's out of town.

18:17.857 --> 18:19.841
- Stef: Huh.
- Knocks a little off my rent.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.960
Wow. Looks just like your place.

18:23.239 --> 18:26.082
Mike: I think it's the same exact floor
plan, except for the extra bedroom.

18:26.107 --> 18:27.848
Stef: Oh, my God.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.947
(sighs) I can't imagine
all of us crammed

18:29.971 --> 18:32.263
in here, living on top of each other.

18:32.288 --> 18:34.871
Mike: I'm sure he'd let
you go month-to-month,

18:34.907 --> 18:36.840
you know, until you guys find a house.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.253
Stef: If we can afford to rent a house.

18:38.277 --> 18:41.011
Mike: Well, when you make detective,

18:41.046 --> 18:42.930
that'll be a big salary bump.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.001
I don't think Brandon
will ever move home

18:48.053 --> 18:50.938
if he knows he has to share
a room with Jesus and Jude.

18:50.990 --> 18:52.272
What's the closet space like?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.622
I don't think Brandon's coming home.

18:55.244 --> 18:57.739
- What do you mean?
- Not as long as Callie's there.

18:58.575 --> 19:01.014
Look, Stef, I know they had sex,

19:01.050 --> 19:02.896
and I know that's why
he moved in with Cortney.

19:02.921 --> 19:06.236
Stef: Wait. You cannot blame
Callie entirely for what happened.

19:06.272 --> 19:07.888
- Okay? It's not fair.
- I'm not.

19:07.923 --> 19:10.185
But you have to admit, she's
caused Brandon a lot of trouble

19:10.209 --> 19:11.683
from the time she showed up.

19:11.708 --> 19:14.094
And Brandon is responsible
for his own actions, Mike.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.013
- I'm not saying he isn't.
- Okay, good.

19:16.048 --> 19:17.881
But I think she toyed with him.

19:17.916 --> 19:19.961
I don't think she meant to, but I
don't think she can help herself,

19:19.985 --> 19:21.852
-which is why I'm worried about AJ.
- Hey.

19:21.887 --> 19:25.044
I mean, wasn't he also her foster
brother when they crossed the line?

19:25.257 --> 19:27.285
And what about this Aaron
kid? He's obviously into her.

19:27.309 --> 19:29.542
- Is she yanking his chain too?
- Okay, okay. That's enough.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.880
Enough. You're talking
about my daughter right now.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.021
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

19:34.427 --> 19:37.442
I just don't want to see
another one of my sons get hurt.

19:51.677 --> 19:53.544
Will you please talk to me, Callie?

19:54.464 --> 19:56.297
I met Aaron at a coffee shop.

19:59.513 --> 20:02.619
He had a law book. I thought he
looked too young to be in law school.

20:05.184 --> 20:07.435
I told him my name was Cameron.

20:08.271 --> 20:10.544
He took me for a ride on his motorcycle.

20:10.569 --> 20:12.146
And we went to the beach.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.239
And he kissed me.

20:18.821 --> 20:20.349
Oh...

20:20.480 --> 20:21.927
When was this?

20:22.153 --> 20:24.136
When I was suspended from school.

20:25.872 --> 20:27.794
I also told him I had a boyfriend.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.888
So he does want to date you?

20:31.017 --> 20:32.350
No, we're just friends.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.043
I'm not toying with you.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.418
Or yanking anyone's chain.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.910
Okay.

20:55.932 --> 20:57.782
Hey. What you doing?

20:58.694 --> 21:00.544
(sighs)

21:00.579 --> 21:03.397
Do you think we can take
Frankie's tree when we go?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.230
Uh... Yeah.

21:07.274 --> 21:09.491
Yeah. I'll make a call.

21:11.161 --> 21:14.635
Hey, uh, we wouldn't be able
to take it where we're going,

21:14.660 --> 21:16.255
I mean, at least not right away.

21:16.399 --> 21:17.333
Where are we going?

21:17.358 --> 21:21.232
There's a three-bedroom apartment
for rent at Mike's building.

21:21.372 --> 21:23.467
It's not huge, but it's
month-to-month, so it's...

21:23.519 --> 21:25.836
(sighs) You already looked at it?

21:25.888 --> 21:27.638
I did. Mike showed it to me.

21:27.673 --> 21:28.817
And I didn't want to lose
it, so I put down a deposit.

21:28.841 --> 21:30.657
Without discussing it with me first.

21:30.659 --> 21:31.703
Lena, we need some place to go.

21:31.727 --> 21:33.294
So this is how it's always going to be?

21:33.650 --> 21:36.513
It's like we take one step
forward and two steps back.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.817
I mean, if nothing is ever going to
change between us, what is the point?

21:45.685 --> 21:48.709
So, what do you think?

21:48.744 --> 21:51.728
I can't think. It's
like sensory overload.

21:51.764 --> 21:53.847
The one redeeming part is Broadway.

21:53.882 --> 21:56.717
I mean, look at all the
billboards. You have Lion King,

21:56.752 --> 21:59.469
Chicago, Hamilton.

21:59.521 --> 22:01.538
This is what I want to do one day.

22:01.573 --> 22:03.590
I want to be on Broadway.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.813
Looks like I'm going blind.

22:09.865 --> 22:11.448
(laughs)

22:11.483 --> 22:13.333
Oh, great. Don't... Don't look.

22:13.385 --> 22:15.369
The big guys in the
costumes, they are, uh...

22:15.404 --> 22:16.724
- Yep. What you were saying.
- Yep.

22:16.755 --> 22:17.788
Got it.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.928
So, do you want to
see the real New York?

22:23.662 --> 22:24.778
What about your party?

22:24.813 --> 22:27.581
Honestly, I... I hate parties.

22:27.616 --> 22:28.649
Can we walk?

22:28.701 --> 22:31.551
Mm-hmm. We can walk all you want.

22:31.603 --> 22:33.983
This is a city that never sleeps.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.928
Gonna make a basket. Literally.

22:45.751 --> 22:47.634
(laughs)

22:49.505 --> 22:52.556
Shh... We have to be quiet.

22:52.581 --> 22:55.415
Okay. Maybe we should stop talking.

22:59.765 --> 23:01.444
Hey, so...

23:02.190 --> 23:06.968
I've never... done anything,
you know, below the waist.

23:07.113 --> 23:09.397
Okay. So...

23:10.576 --> 23:12.514
Everybody has their first time.

23:15.397 --> 23:16.797
(stammers) Don't.

23:16.832 --> 23:18.452
Look, I just...

23:18.609 --> 23:20.642
I don't think I'm ready for that.

23:20.803 --> 23:24.521
Um... Okay. Sorry.

23:24.556 --> 23:26.690
- I should go.
- You don't have to go.

23:26.742 --> 23:28.625
No. It's... it's like, um...

23:28.660 --> 23:30.421
I'll talk to you later.

23:37.070 --> 23:40.150
Well I can't remember the
last time I saw a sunrise.

23:40.968 --> 23:42.801
(laughs) What?

23:42.836 --> 23:44.499
You better not fall asleep
during your audition.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.357
(laughs) No.

23:47.656 --> 23:49.922
I feel... great.

23:59.874 --> 24:01.702
Everything okay?

24:01.754 --> 24:05.694
Um, I've... got a girlfriend.

24:06.874 --> 24:09.626
Ah, back in San Diego.

24:09.662 --> 24:12.012
And, uh...

24:12.014 --> 24:14.952
we sort of live together.

24:16.843 --> 24:19.720
And she has a kid.

24:19.722 --> 24:22.116
She... has a kid?

24:22.602 --> 24:24.483
His name is Mason.

24:25.077 --> 24:26.977
Wow, um...

24:27.206 --> 24:29.897
What are you going to do
if you get into Juilliard?

24:33.084 --> 24:34.764
I don't know.

24:35.771 --> 24:37.755
I don't know. I...

24:37.807 --> 24:40.674
I mean, I... I help support her.

24:41.124 --> 24:42.693
And I pay half the rent.

24:42.728 --> 24:45.068
I watch Mason practically every day.

24:45.093 --> 24:46.930
Do you even want this?

24:46.966 --> 24:49.583
Do you really, really want this?

24:49.966 --> 24:52.200
I mean, I want to go to
Juilliard more than anything.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.109
Do you have any idea what
it takes to study here?

24:56.561 --> 24:57.858
Everything.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.011
And after every 16-hour day,

25:01.046 --> 25:03.614
you have nothing left
to give to anybody.

25:04.139 --> 25:06.033
And you shouldn't have to.

25:06.301 --> 25:09.052
These four years are yours.

25:10.155 --> 25:13.361
I mean, you don't... You
don't have to be mean.

25:13.675 --> 25:17.377
You have every right to be selfish.

25:19.186 --> 25:22.616
You can't go into your audition
with a piece of you feeling

25:22.651 --> 25:24.757
obligated to fail.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.186
'Cause you will.

25:27.890 --> 25:30.902
(stammers) What do I do, then? I mean...

25:32.402 --> 25:35.646
- Break up with her?
- (grunts)

25:35.681 --> 25:38.113
- What, like on the phone?
- Yeah.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.358
(scoffs)

25:42.993 --> 25:45.193
I... I don't think I can do that.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.006
Then... write her a letter.

25:50.207 --> 25:52.573
Yeah. Put it all down on paper,

25:52.598 --> 25:54.442
how bad you feel, all of it,

25:54.467 --> 25:56.500
and then you put a
stamp on it and mail it.

25:57.574 --> 25:59.620
You'll beat it back to San Diego,

25:59.622 --> 26:02.301
and... then you can do it in person.

26:03.277 --> 26:05.559
Right now, you need to
do this for yourself.

26:05.817 --> 26:09.465
So... that way, when
you play tomorrow...

26:09.654 --> 26:13.439
Well, today... (laughs)

26:14.058 --> 26:15.874
... you're free.

26:27.706 --> 26:29.789
Callie: You're selling this?

26:29.919 --> 26:32.809
I gave this to you
for your 13th birthday.

26:33.662 --> 26:35.729
It's a kid's toy, Callie.

26:35.945 --> 26:37.496
Okay, look.

26:38.041 --> 26:40.091
I didn't tell Moms about the pot,

26:40.152 --> 26:42.121
so I did keep your secret.

26:42.911 --> 26:44.344
And if I see someone who I
think is a bad influence on you,

26:44.346 --> 26:47.510
I'm not just going to stand
by and watch you screw up.

26:47.535 --> 26:49.020
You don't know anything about Noah.

26:49.449 --> 26:51.366
He's not a bad influence.

26:51.824 --> 26:54.192
And at least he's not my foster brother.

26:56.754 --> 26:58.201
Okay.

27:00.996 --> 27:02.879
(phone ringing)

27:04.200 --> 27:06.800
Hey, Mom. We're just setting up
the yard sale. Can I call you back?

27:08.691 --> 27:10.098
Oh, my God.

27:10.731 --> 27:13.371
Excuse me. How much is this?

27:15.582 --> 27:18.195
Man: It's a beautiful
house. Why you selling?

27:18.527 --> 27:21.590
Uh... (chuckles) Downsizing, you know.

27:21.615 --> 27:24.582
Huh. You're selling the
Art of War. It's a classic.

27:24.607 --> 27:25.823
How much you want for it?

27:25.848 --> 27:27.299
I don't know. A dollar.
Does that sound good?

27:27.324 --> 27:28.972
- I'll give you 50 cents.
- Sold.

27:29.007 --> 27:30.668
- Thank you.
- Huh.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.310
I should probably introduce myself.

27:33.345 --> 27:35.178
Detective Joe Gray.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.035
I understand you're interested
in an old case of mine.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.520
Oh, yeah? Where'd you get that idea?

27:43.572 --> 27:46.000
It doesn't matter where. I also
hear you're trying to make detective.

27:46.024 --> 27:47.908
The first thing you
learn, if you do make it,

27:47.960 --> 27:49.976
is that we don't meddle
in each other's cases.

27:49.978 --> 27:52.862
We respect each other.
We got each other's backs.

27:52.898 --> 27:55.254
But then again, that's
if you make detective.

27:56.590 --> 27:58.660
- Thank you for the heads-up.
- No problem.

27:58.879 --> 28:00.385
Have nice yard sale.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.393
I hope you make a killing.

28:06.061 --> 28:09.012
- (phone ringing)
- Hello? Kyle...

28:10.667 --> 28:12.700
Yeah, slow down. What's going on?

28:12.893 --> 28:15.846
- Hey.
- What?

28:15.871 --> 28:17.904
My mom negotiated a
payment plan with the IRS,

28:17.956 --> 28:20.134
and she took a loan against
her pension to pay of the lien.

28:20.606 --> 28:22.158
Okay. What does... What does that mean?

28:22.210 --> 28:24.012
We don't have to sell the house.

28:26.292 --> 28:29.043
Okay. But... But we already have.

28:51.559 --> 28:54.550
_

28:56.114 --> 28:58.402
They're sending Kyle

28:58.427 --> 28:59.762
Aaron (over phone): But he's not 18 yet.

28:59.787 --> 29:00.571
I know.

29:00.596 --> 29:04.339
Listen. Do we really need Doug Harvey
to admit to knowing Martha Johnson?

29:05.234 --> 29:08.152
I mean, like, if we
somehow got some DNA,

29:08.456 --> 29:10.087
tested it and it was a match.

29:10.112 --> 29:12.389
It wouldn't be admissible in court.

29:12.519 --> 29:15.261
But would it be enough to
get the JJC to take the case?

29:15.286 --> 29:17.353
If there was another potential suspect?

29:17.678 --> 29:20.462
Maybe. But how do we get his DNA?

29:24.050 --> 29:25.853
Hey, I'm getting another
call. Can I call you back?

29:25.878 --> 29:28.422
Okay. Don't do anything crazy, please.

29:28.658 --> 29:30.183
No, I won't.

29:51.580 --> 29:53.511
Woman: Brandon Foster?

29:54.504 --> 29:57.572

30:05.311 --> 30:08.262

31:40.523 --> 31:44.691

okay. It's okay. Shh!

32:08.267 --> 32:10.200
Come on. Come on.

32:11.287 --> 32:13.570

33:13.532 --> 33:18.402

33:18.454 --> 33:20.655
Wait. You're getting a divorce.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.396
Now that we have your attention.

33:22.441 --> 33:26.039
We're not getting a divorce.
We are filing for divorce.

33:26.064 --> 33:28.562
- Why?
- So we can freeze our assets.

33:28.614 --> 33:30.787
The buyer doesn't want
to let us out of escrow.

33:30.812 --> 33:33.787
But if our assets, including
this house, are tied up...

33:33.812 --> 33:35.867
We're hoping that they'll walk away.

33:36.984 --> 33:40.257
Wow. That's actually a
devious plan. I'm impressed.

33:40.292 --> 33:43.393
We actually got it from our realtor,
ironically, who is getting divorced.

33:43.429 --> 33:45.742
And we're not trying to
be devious. We're just...

33:45.767 --> 33:47.945
just trying to hold on
to this home that we love.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.550
- How does that sound to you guys?
- Amazing.

33:50.602 --> 33:51.652
- Awesome.
- Great.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.763
Now we have to stay here.

33:57.258 --> 33:58.698
What is going on with her?

33:58.875 --> 34:01.787
Outside of the usual drama,
she read your journal.

34:01.812 --> 34:04.102
- My journal?
- No. Yours.

34:04.297 --> 34:06.297
Jesus: And what you
said in it about Mama.

34:06.536 --> 34:08.402
What did you say about
me in your journal?

34:14.193 --> 34:16.208
(keyboard clacking)

34:19.456 --> 34:21.828
(sighs) Can I please explain?

34:22.501 --> 34:25.117
What's to explain? You didn't want us.

34:25.141 --> 34:26.382
That's not true.

34:28.312 --> 34:32.192
I remember when Mom first walked
through the door with the two of you.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.523
You ran right over to me
and you leapt into my arms.

34:36.054 --> 34:38.210
You bonded with me instantly,

34:38.693 --> 34:40.743
and it made me a little uncomfortable.

34:42.391 --> 34:44.509
Oh, so you just didn't want me?

34:44.677 --> 34:47.641
No. It made me uncomfortable because...

34:48.652 --> 34:51.518
my own mother was never
very affectionate with me.

34:52.638 --> 34:53.554
Grandma?

34:53.699 --> 34:55.899
She softened up over the years, but...

34:57.180 --> 35:00.187
she just wasn't nurturing in that way.

35:01.607 --> 35:02.937
And...

35:04.075 --> 35:08.094
when I looked at you, I saw
me as that little girl...

35:10.116 --> 35:12.066
who yearned for her mom to...

35:12.812 --> 35:15.164
to hold her and comfort her.

35:15.970 --> 35:18.921
And I guess it scared me a little,

35:19.044 --> 35:21.028
and it made me sad.

35:24.444 --> 35:26.344
And then one night,

35:26.369 --> 35:28.336
you had a bad dream.

35:28.696 --> 35:31.614
You woke up crying, and
I came into this room...

35:32.685 --> 35:34.398
and I held you...

35:36.442 --> 35:38.523
and my heart broke right open.

35:41.155 --> 35:43.625
I felt so much love for you...

35:45.601 --> 35:47.517
and so much compassion.

35:50.806 --> 35:53.691
And I realized, in that moment that...

35:55.180 --> 35:57.547
this sweet, sweet little girl...

35:58.596 --> 36:00.320
was sent to me.

36:03.007 --> 36:06.352
She was sent to me to
heal my little girl inside.

36:09.228 --> 36:11.312
And I realized that...

36:11.847 --> 36:14.164
you were meant to be my daughter...

36:15.757 --> 36:17.641
and I was meant to be your mother.

36:20.494 --> 36:22.511
Adopting you was a gift.

36:24.187 --> 36:27.258
You and your brother have
brought me the greatest joy.

36:30.748 --> 36:32.531
And the thing that I'm...

36:32.810 --> 36:35.977
most proud of in my life
is being your mother.

36:38.004 --> 36:40.855
And I'm so sorry that
you read what you did.

36:47.396 --> 36:48.396
Hey.

36:49.484 --> 36:51.789
Hey. Can I ask you something?

36:52.961 --> 36:55.401
Is there some reason that you
don't want to stay in this house?

36:58.009 --> 37:00.393
No. I... I just said that.

37:02.512 --> 37:03.528
You're sure.

37:05.588 --> 37:06.859
Yeah.

37:14.034 --> 37:15.166
Hey.

37:15.264 --> 37:18.418
So, I'm sorry I was
such an ass last night.

37:18.443 --> 37:19.875
It's... it's okay.

37:20.578 --> 37:23.196
My moms found your pipe by the way.

37:23.248 --> 37:24.248
Oh.

37:25.334 --> 37:27.516
- Damn.
- I... played dumb.

37:27.929 --> 37:30.531
They think it belongs to the
guy who worked on the garage.

37:30.992 --> 37:33.173
- I'm sorry, man. I...
- Look.

37:33.175 --> 37:34.500
I'm sorry too,

37:35.120 --> 37:36.523
about last night.

37:37.613 --> 37:41.295
You were right. Everyone
does have a first time,

37:41.320 --> 37:45.883
and I guess, maybe,
I was just... nervous.

37:46.990 --> 37:51.422
But I still want to
if... you, you know...
