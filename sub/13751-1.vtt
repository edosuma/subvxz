Rodrigo.

03:57.052 --> 04:00.389
Rodrigo, we will find
the men we need in there.

04:23.412 --> 04:25.372
We are from the village
of Santa Poco.

04:29.543 --> 04:31.295
We have come here for your help.

04:39.386 --> 04:42.639
A very great injustice
has been done.

04:42.723 --> 04:46.143
A man named El Guapo's
threatening our very lives.

04:46.226 --> 04:50.481
We are looking for men who are brave
enough to stand up to this tyrant.

04:53.275 --> 04:54.610
Senorita.

04:55.444 --> 04:57.738
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

05:12.127 --> 05:13.253
I'll help ya.

05:16.632 --> 05:19.051
But first you're gonna
help me, darlin'.

05:21.553 --> 05:24.348
- Leave him alone!
- Get out of here!

05:30.437 --> 05:34.024
They are no better than El Guapo.
They will not help us.

05:34.108 --> 05:36.443
- No one will help us.
- Rodrigo, you must have faith.

05:36.485 --> 05:39.989
The Holy Mother will help us.

08:39.793 --> 08:43.714
With three men such as these, El Guapo
would not dare to enter our village.

Three...

09:23.462 --> 09:25.214
Amigos.

09:25.297 --> 09:28.050
We have seen your deeds
and think you are very great.

09:29.968 --> 09:33.347
We can pay you 100,000 pesos.

09:33.430 --> 09:34.890
A hundred thousand pesos?

09:35.849 --> 09:38.185
We do not have 100,000 pesos.

09:38.268 --> 09:40.688
Don't worry, Rodrigo.
They will refuse it.

09:40.729 --> 09:42.981
But it would be an insult
not to offer it to them.

09:44.566 --> 09:47.903
One hundred thousand...

09:47.987 --> 09:49.113
pesos.

09:49.196 --> 09:52.741
One hundred thousand pesos
if you come to Santa Poco...

09:52.825 --> 09:56.578
and put on a show of your strength
and stop the...

09:56.662 --> 09:58.455
the horrible...

09:58.539 --> 10:00.124
Evil, murdering.

10:00.207 --> 10:02.876
Villainous monster, El Guapo...

10:02.918 --> 10:07.047
so that once again we
can be a peaceful village.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.559
Twenty-three pesos.

10:21.186 --> 10:22.813
We only have ten.

10:26.358 --> 10:29.361
Okay. I give you
the ten-pesos version.

10:31.113 --> 10:32.990
You are great.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.952
One hundred thousand pesos.

10:37.745 --> 10:41.707
If you come to Santa Poco.
Put on show.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.084
Stop the...

10:49.923 --> 10:52.092
I'll put "infamous El Guapo."

10:52.176 --> 10:53.135
Infamous?

10:54.636 --> 10:57.431
It means murderous, evil.

10:57.473 --> 11:00.517
All like you said.
And it will save you money.

11:00.601 --> 11:02.102
Thank you.

11:25.292 --> 11:29.171
We've got to get back to basics.
Shootin' for Love.

11:29.254 --> 11:33.342
Wanderers of the West.
The Ride of the Three Amigos.

11:33.425 --> 11:36.804
All the great Amigo pictures
had one thing in common...

11:36.887 --> 11:39.348
three wealthy
Spanish landowners...

11:39.431 --> 11:41.892
who fight for the rights
of peasants.

11:41.975 --> 11:44.645
Now, that's something
everyone likes.

11:44.687 --> 11:46.438
It's a people idea.

11:46.522 --> 11:50.442
It's a story a nation
can sink its teeth into.

11:50.526 --> 11:54.196
But then came Those Darn Amigos.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.574
A box office failure.
Nobody went to see it.

11:57.658 --> 12:01.328
Because nobody cares about three
wealthy Spanish landowners...

12:01.370 --> 12:03.747
on a weekend in Manhattan.

12:03.831 --> 12:06.333
We strayed from the formula...

12:06.417 --> 12:08.544
and we paid the price.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.173
- I thought we were quite good in it.
- Good?

12:13.215 --> 12:14.758
We were great.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.512
Why don't you tell the boys
about the Cochise picture, Morty?

12:19.388 --> 12:22.433
Sandy and Irving
are working on it right now.

12:22.516 --> 12:26.228
You meet Cochise. At first
you think he's a terrible guy.

12:26.311 --> 12:29.148
You fight,
then you get to know him.

12:29.231 --> 12:32.651
You come to respect each other,
and at the end of the picture...

12:32.735 --> 12:33.861
you're friends.

12:33.902 --> 12:35.779
We send you boys to Baja.

12:35.863 --> 12:38.741
We shoot the picture in eight days.
What do you think?

12:44.913 --> 12:46.999
That'll be the day.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.169
What did he say?

12:50.252 --> 12:53.088
He said, "That'll be the day,"
Mr. Flugleman.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.507
What?

12:56.634 --> 12:59.178
I don't think you understand
who you're talking to here.

12:59.261 --> 13:01.805
We have a few items
we want to straighten out first...

13:01.889 --> 13:04.183
or you might be looking
at three actors...

13:04.266 --> 13:07.394
who really don't feel like
making a Geronimo picture.

13:09.813 --> 13:12.107
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:12.191 --> 13:14.193
Lucky, I think maybe we should...

13:14.276 --> 13:17.321
What we're talking about
is money, real money.

13:17.404 --> 13:19.323
Amigo money.

13:19.406 --> 13:22.159
No dough, no show.

13:23.827 --> 13:26.163
Boys. Boys.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.584
Let me just say one thing.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.504
It'll be a cold day in hell
when Harry Flugleman...

13:33.587 --> 13:37.299
let's an actor
tell him what to do!

13:38.300 --> 13:41.428
Do you know what
the word nada means?

13:41.470 --> 13:43.931
In all those Mexican movies
you made...

13:43.972 --> 13:46.266
did you ever hear that word?

13:47.309 --> 13:50.104
- Isn't that a light chicken gravy...
- It means "nothing"!

13:50.187 --> 13:53.941
Zero. Zip. It's what you're gonna have
when I'm through with you!

13:53.983 --> 13:56.485
You hit Harry Flugleman
on a bad day.

13:56.527 --> 13:59.113
I'd like to continue
to work for free, Mr. Flugleman.

14:00.155 --> 14:02.324
Are you living
in the studio mansion?

14:03.534 --> 14:04.618
Yeah.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.537
Not anymore, you're not.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.456
- Sam!
- The Amigos are out of the mansion.

14:09.498 --> 14:12.835
Where did you get those clothes?
From a movie?

14:12.918 --> 14:16.296
Yeah, the studio gave them to us.
Those Darn Amigos.

14:16.380 --> 14:19.133
Well, we're taking them back.
Sam!

14:19.216 --> 14:22.636
Get wardrobe over here right away.
Take the Amigos' clothes.

14:22.678 --> 14:25.931
Wait a minute!
You can't take our clothes.

14:26.014 --> 14:28.976
You gave us these clothes.
They were presents!

14:29.017 --> 14:30.310
Wait a minute!

14:30.352 --> 14:31.645
Lucky.

14:31.687 --> 14:35.733
Wait a second. I think you
misread who you're talking to here.

14:36.817 --> 14:39.069
Misread?

14:39.153 --> 14:43.574
I want these schmucks off of my lot.
Your asses have just been streamlined.

14:43.657 --> 14:47.494
The Three Amigos are history.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.664
You're through!

14:54.710 --> 14:58.714
And Mr. Flugleman says you're not
to come back on this lot ever!

15:04.762 --> 15:08.849
Look, boys, I know show business.
Something always turns up.

15:08.932 --> 15:10.476
Telegram for the Three Amigos.

15:20.694 --> 15:23.030
"Three Amigos,
Hollywood, California.

15:23.113 --> 15:24.531
You are very great.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.328
One hundred thousand pesos
to come to Santa Poco.

15:29.411 --> 15:32.039
Put on show. Stop.

15:32.122 --> 15:35.250
The infamous El Guapo."

15:35.334 --> 15:38.712
What does that mean?
"In-famous"?

15:38.796 --> 15:43.676
In-famous is when you're
more than famous.

15:43.759 --> 15:47.972
This man El Guapo is not just famous,
he's in-famous.

15:48.055 --> 15:51.809
A hundred thousand pesos to do
a personal appearance with El Guapo...

15:51.892 --> 15:54.645
who is probably the biggest actor
to ever come out of Mexico.

15:54.728 --> 15:57.064
Wow. The in-famous?

15:57.106 --> 15:59.108
In-famous?

16:15.749 --> 16:19.420
Wouldn't it be easier if we just
asked Flugleman for our Amigo costumes?

16:19.503 --> 16:22.881
No, Flugleman hates us right now.
He's never gonna give us our costumes.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.967
Lucky's right.
This is the only way.

17:03.839 --> 17:06.300
You two! You!

17:06.342 --> 17:08.135
You two!

17:08.218 --> 17:09.636
Look!

17:13.098 --> 17:16.060
Whippoorwill, whippoorwill!
Look up here, look up here!

17:17.560 --> 17:20.064
Hey, you, look! Up here!

17:20.146 --> 17:22.941
Up here, up here!

17:25.527 --> 17:27.445
Hey, you guys!

17:30.616 --> 17:31.700
This way.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.143
Turn on the lights.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.690
Hey, what's goin' on up there?

18:02.773 --> 18:05.526
Let's go, Amigos.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.157
Adios!

18:52.614 --> 18:55.909
I'm looking for a man
by the name of El Guapo.

18:56.952 --> 18:58.162
Do you know this man?

18:59.955 --> 19:01.957
Perhaps, senor.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.626
Where'd you get
that pretty little gun?

19:08.297 --> 19:12.634
El Guapo will be interested to see me.
I have something he wants.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.511
I'm talkin' to you.

19:15.929 --> 19:18.474
Where'd you get
that pretty little gun?

19:19.558 --> 19:21.477
I'm meeting some friends
of mine here.

19:22.811 --> 19:26.106
When they get here,
tell them to wait.

19:26.190 --> 19:27.775
How will I know them?

19:27.858 --> 19:30.110
You will know them.

19:30.194 --> 19:32.738
You will most certainly know them.

19:34.365 --> 19:37.368
Why don't you come over here
and sit on my lap?

19:37.451 --> 19:39.870
I wanna show you something, honey.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.197
Anyone else with a comment?

20:21.078 --> 20:22.997
Some friends of mine
will be coming here.

20:23.080 --> 20:27.543
I hope you will show them more
courtesy than you have shown me.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.170
They aren't as kindhearted
as I am.

21:16.967 --> 21:19.762
Looks like somebody's been down here
with the ugly stick.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.349
Let's go.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.819
Excuse us.

21:35.903 --> 21:39.073
We're not Mexicans.
We're from out of town.

21:39.114 --> 21:42.201
We were wondering if you could tell us
where the best hotel in town is.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.119
There's no hotel in this town.

21:44.203 --> 21:48.082
Great. No hotel.
I could kill somebody.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.168
Excuse me.

21:51.251 --> 21:53.170
You are the...

21:56.799 --> 21:59.301
Yes, we are.

21:59.384 --> 22:00.803
We have heard of you.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.304
No kidding.

22:03.972 --> 22:06.266
I have a message for you.

22:08.143 --> 22:10.813
The German says to wait here.

22:13.315 --> 22:15.400
Hmm, yeah.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.782
Well, so long as we've got some time
to kill, I think I'll have a beer.

22:21.865 --> 22:24.326
We don't have no beer.
Just tequila.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.536
What's tequila?

22:25.619 --> 22:27.329
It's like beer.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.956
Is it fattening?

22:29.039 --> 22:30.124
Fattenings?

22:30.207 --> 22:32.710
Forget it. If it's like beer,
we'll have some. Three tequilas.

22:32.793 --> 22:35.754
Sure. Sure, amigos.

22:35.838 --> 22:37.256
Enjoy yourselves.

22:38.549 --> 22:42.052
But try not to get
into too much trouble, okay?

22:45.514 --> 22:46.598
Thank you.

23:03.032 --> 23:04.491
Hey there!

23:08.120 --> 23:11.498
- It's an odd taste, isn't it?
- It's probably watered down.

23:13.542 --> 23:16.754
There's something about this place.
Everybody seems so grim.

23:16.837 --> 23:20.257
They're just intimidated.
They've only seen us on the big screen.

23:24.261 --> 23:27.097
We're just folks like you.
Just relax.

23:28.223 --> 23:31.143
Dusty, go on over
to that piano.

23:31.226 --> 23:33.145
Oh, no.

23:33.228 --> 23:35.564
I haven't played in so long,
I couldn't, really.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.528
Been a long time.

23:41.612 --> 23:44.198
All right, we're gonna do
a little number for you...

23:44.281 --> 23:47.242
but remember, we're a bit rusty,
so bear with us.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.620
- Just like the old days.
- All right.

23:49.703 --> 23:50.788
Maestro.

24:04.301 --> 24:08.555
<i>My little buttercup
has the sweetest smile</i>

24:11.308 --> 24:15.312
<i>Dear little buttercup
won't you stay a while</i>

24:18.274 --> 24:22.111
<i>Come with me
where moonbeams paint the sky</i>

24:24.863 --> 24:28.283
<i>And you and I might linger</i>

24:28.367 --> 24:32.079
<i>In the sweet by-and-by</i>

24:32.121 --> 24:34.665
<i>Oh, dear little buttercup</i>

24:34.748 --> 24:38.585
<i>With your eyes so blue</i>

24:40.045 --> 24:41.964
<i>Oh, little buttercup</i>

24:42.047 --> 24:44.466
<i>You're a dream come true</i>

24:46.718 --> 24:48.137
<i>You and I</i>

24:48.220 --> 24:51.181
<i>Will settle down in a cottage</i>

24:51.265 --> 24:52.474
<i>Built for two</i>

24:52.558 --> 24:54.268
<i>Oh</i>

24:54.309 --> 24:56.270
<i>Dear little buttercup</i>

24:56.311 --> 24:59.773
<i>I love you</i>

24:59.815 --> 25:01.400
Everybody!

25:01.483 --> 25:03.944
<i>My little buttercup</i>

25:03.986 --> 25:06.280
<i>- Has the sweetest
- Smile.</i>

25:06.363 --> 25:08.198
Hey, great.

25:08.282 --> 25:10.701
<i>Dear little buttercup</i>

25:10.784 --> 25:13.120
<i>- Won't you stay a...
- While, while!</i>

25:15.164 --> 25:18.041
<i>You and I will settle down</i>

25:18.125 --> 25:21.879
<i>In a cottage built for two</i>

25:21.962 --> 25:23.380
<i>Oh</i>

25:23.464 --> 25:25.299
<i>Dear little buttercup</i>

25:25.382 --> 25:27.217
<i>- Sweet.
- Little buttercup</i>

25:27.301 --> 25:29.470
<i>My little buttercup</i>

25:29.511 --> 25:32.848
<i>I love you</i>

25:43.650 --> 25:44.818
What'd I tell ya?

25:44.860 --> 25:46.820
Yeah, they loved us.

25:54.036 --> 25:56.664
- What is that?
- It's a plane.

25:56.705 --> 26:00.167
Not just any plane.
It's a Tuppan-601.

26:01.543 --> 26:03.837
I flew one in
Little Neddy Goes to War.

26:05.506 --> 26:06.590
What's it doing here?

26:06.674 --> 26:08.759
I think it's a mail plane.

26:08.842 --> 26:10.552
How can you tell?

26:10.636 --> 26:14.014
Well, didn't you notice
its little balls?

26:17.935 --> 26:20.687
The little balls hanging down.

26:24.691 --> 26:27.277
The little... The balls.

26:27.361 --> 26:29.947
The mail plane.
It's a "male" plane.

26:30.030 --> 26:31.949
And the balls...

26:47.631 --> 26:50.551
Let's go find out
where we're supposed to be.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.648
Hey, look at the two
little sissies!

27:22.291 --> 27:25.419
This town is getting
too rough for me.

27:26.837 --> 27:30.424
Carmen, the Three Amigos...
I saw them coming out of the cantina.

27:37.306 --> 27:39.600
- You are the Three Amigos?
- Yes, we are.

27:43.479 --> 27:45.022
Told you we were big down here.

27:48.442 --> 27:51.236
Come. We will take you
to Santa Poco.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.613
- Great!
- Fine.

28:19.973 --> 28:22.059
This is our village.

28:41.412 --> 28:44.665
Isn't that the Three Amigos?

28:44.748 --> 28:47.209
Do you think they can
protect us from El Guapo?

28:54.174 --> 28:57.428
- Welcome to Santa Poco.
- Here you go.

28:59.430 --> 29:01.598
Dusty Bottoms.

29:05.894 --> 29:08.439
Can I have your watch
when you are dead?

29:10.399 --> 29:12.317
What did he say?

29:17.906 --> 29:20.659
Mmm, that's good. Very good.

29:41.305 --> 29:44.600
We are honored
to have you in our home.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.021
Do you have anything
besides Mexican food?

29:51.774 --> 29:54.735
Lucky, how's this show
supposed to work anyway?

29:56.403 --> 30:00.240
Well, I talked to Rodrigo tonight.
He's the kid.

30:00.282 --> 30:02.826
He was kind of hazy
on the details...

30:02.910 --> 30:04.787
but as far as I can figure...

30:04.870 --> 30:07.539
El Guapo's coming
in a day or two.

30:07.623 --> 30:10.250
He rides in,
acts like he owns the place.

30:10.292 --> 30:14.129
We come out, put on a big show
and pretend like we run him off.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.715
It's pretty much what we did
in Shootin' for Love.

30:23.430 --> 30:27.267
Lucky. What are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

30:31.397 --> 30:32.982
A car.

30:33.065 --> 30:36.151
A big, shiny, silver car.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.363
I'll drive all over Hollywood...

30:39.446 --> 30:41.991
show Flugleman a thing or two.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.576
What about you?

30:44.660 --> 30:47.579
New York. Maybe Paris.

30:48.998 --> 30:50.916
A lot of champagne.

30:51.959 --> 30:55.129
Parties.
Be a big shot for a while.

30:55.170 --> 30:56.922
Yeah.

30:57.673 --> 30:58.966
How 'bout you, Ned?

30:59.008 --> 31:02.302
I'm gonna start a foundation
to help homeless children.

31:04.638 --> 31:07.057
That occurred to me
to do that at one point too.

31:07.141 --> 31:11.103
I meant I would do that first,
and then I would get a big, shiny car.

31:16.817 --> 31:18.694
Let's get some more tequila.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.655
El Guapo said to wait here.

31:22.656 --> 31:24.867
By the time he's here,
we'll be back.

31:27.119 --> 31:31.540
Let's go to Santa Poco.
They'll be glad to see us!

32:01.737 --> 32:03.739
Which one do you like best?

32:06.075 --> 32:08.368
I like the one
who's not so smart.

32:09.912 --> 32:11.163
Which one is that?

32:11.246 --> 32:13.624
Juanita.

32:17.378 --> 32:19.421
Bandidos! Bandidos!

32:19.505 --> 32:22.299
Sooner than expected.
I must warn the Three Amigos.

32:22.383 --> 32:23.550
Bandidos!

32:31.934 --> 32:33.852
They are coming!

32:35.396 --> 32:38.023
- Who?
- El Guapo and his men.

32:38.774 --> 32:40.692
Already?

32:40.776 --> 32:42.903
Well, we'll start
to get ready then.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.202
Geez, they want us
to do the show now.

32:50.285 --> 32:53.414
- Weren't we going to have a rehearsal?
- Obviously not.

32:53.497 --> 32:56.875
They've probably done it a million
times, and we know what we're doing.

33:02.131 --> 33:04.633
Looks like there's
about three of them.

33:06.218 --> 33:09.138
Perfect. Rodrigo said
there'd be 50, now there's 3.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.597
They better not cut our money.

33:10.639 --> 33:13.392
Where's our tequila?
We're waiting!

33:23.736 --> 33:25.654
Say, those guys look pretty good.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.240
Are you kidding? They're doing
every cliche in the book.

33:28.323 --> 33:32.077
We'll give them 30 seconds. I hope
those horses they got for us are okay.

33:32.161 --> 33:35.664
If I have to come into that cantina,
somebody's gonna die!

33:43.088 --> 33:45.591
Okay, Amigos, this is it.
Ned, big smile.

33:45.633 --> 33:49.344
- Dusty, relax and have fun with it.
- I'm just gonna have fun with it.

34:01.857 --> 34:04.067
- I'm Lucky Day.
- I'm Ned Nederlander.

34:04.151 --> 34:06.362
I'm Dusty Bottoms,
and together we're...

34:06.445 --> 34:08.362
The Three Amigos!

34:26.172 --> 34:28.257
Let's go!

34:37.184 --> 34:39.353
Well, you slime-eating dogs...

34:39.395 --> 34:41.188
you scum-sucking pigs...

34:41.230 --> 34:44.983
you sons of a motherless goat.

34:45.067 --> 34:48.737
Son of a motherless goat?
And who are you?

34:48.821 --> 34:52.574
Wherever there is injustice,
you will find us.

34:53.867 --> 34:57.036
Wherever there is suffering,
we'll be there.

34:59.081 --> 35:00.165
Line.

35:00.249 --> 35:05.045
Wherever liberty is threatened...

35:05.129 --> 35:06.922
you will find...

35:07.005 --> 35:09.800
The Three Amigos.

35:23.439 --> 35:25.983
- Who are these monkeys?
- I don't know.

35:27.568 --> 35:28.694
Should we kill them?

35:28.777 --> 35:31.864
No, let's go tell El Guapo
what we've seen here.

35:41.582 --> 35:43.500
And stay out.

35:47.921 --> 35:50.007
- Nice show.
- Not bad for a matinee.

35:50.090 --> 35:53.802
- Damn it, I forgot a line though.
- They'll never notice it.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.786
They're really starved
for entertainment around here.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.247
I'm telling you, I've been
in this situation before.

36:22.331 --> 36:24.249
Ask for the money now
while they're excited.

36:28.837 --> 36:30.797
You were magnificent.

36:30.839 --> 36:32.925
- Oh!
- We were okay.

36:43.811 --> 36:44.937
Then what happened?

36:44.979 --> 36:47.815
Then they got on their horses.

36:47.898 --> 36:52.444
They rode all over the town,
shooting their pistolas up in the air.

36:53.529 --> 36:56.865
And they called us
scum-sucking pigs.

36:56.949 --> 36:58.033
Us!

37:00.494 --> 37:02.788
What should we do, El Guapo?

37:03.539 --> 37:06.792
Tomorrow I will take
50 men with me...

37:06.834 --> 37:09.795
find these three gringos,
open their stomachs...

37:09.837 --> 37:12.965
grab their intestines
and squeeze the shit out of them!

37:19.930 --> 37:21.682
Perfect.

39:10.791 --> 39:13.294
Do you have a girlfriend
back home, Dusty?

39:16.922 --> 39:20.926
We never really had time for that
sort of thing, being so busy.

39:20.968 --> 39:23.762
Have you ever kissed a girl?

39:23.804 --> 39:26.515
Oh, yeah. Sure, lots of times.

39:28.308 --> 39:30.602
Would you like to kiss me?

39:31.437 --> 39:32.855
Yeah.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.363
Well?

39:45.159 --> 39:47.619
What, now? Here?

39:48.370 --> 39:51.915
We could take a walk,
and you could kiss me on the veranda.

39:53.250 --> 39:55.919
Lips would be fine.

39:56.003 --> 39:57.963
One time Dorothy Gish...

39:58.046 --> 40:01.383
was visiting me
on the set of...

40:01.467 --> 40:04.511
Little Neddy, Grab Your Gun.

40:04.595 --> 40:07.639
And she came up to me...

40:07.723 --> 40:10.392
and she looked me in the face.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.853
I'd never met her.
I just know her from the films.

40:12.895 --> 40:15.105
You know, Dorothy Gish...

40:15.189 --> 40:17.024
Lillian's sister.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.651
And she looked me in the eyes
and she said...

40:21.028 --> 40:25.407
"Young man, you have got it."

40:27.326 --> 40:28.744
And...

40:33.248 --> 40:35.209
Dorothy Gish.

40:35.250 --> 40:37.211
It's a true story.

40:57.231 --> 41:01.109
Next time we come here,
I'm gonna ask for a different room.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.695
Amigos,
El Guapo himself is here...

41:03.779 --> 41:06.073
with all his men,
just outside the village.

41:06.115 --> 41:10.536
I have your horses waiting.
You must ride against them now.

41:11.787 --> 41:14.998
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.

41:31.306 --> 41:33.725
Looks like we got
another show to do.

41:33.809 --> 41:36.437
- Great.
- Let's get it over with.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.397
Yeah.

41:45.529 --> 41:47.030
Let's go.

41:51.994 --> 41:54.747
They are so brave.

42:08.510 --> 42:10.721
It's a pleasure working with you.

42:12.389 --> 42:15.684
Well, you dirt-eating
piece of slime...

42:15.768 --> 42:17.895
you scum-sucking pig...

42:17.978 --> 42:20.355
you son of a motherless goat.

42:21.732 --> 42:22.900
Who are you?

42:22.983 --> 42:27.154
Wherever there is injustice,
you will find us.

42:27.237 --> 42:30.824
Wherever there is suffering,
we'll be there.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.036
Tell us we will die like dogs.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.120
What?

42:35.162 --> 42:37.498
Tell us we will die like dogs.

42:41.001 --> 42:42.920
You will die like dogs.

42:43.003 --> 42:47.716
No, we will not die like dogs!
We will fight like lions.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.095
- Because we are...
- The Three Amigos.

43:01.647 --> 43:02.982
Ride, caballeros!

43:05.651 --> 43:07.945
Ride, Amigos.

43:19.248 --> 43:21.208
I like these guys.

43:22.293 --> 43:24.420
They are funny guys.

43:26.046 --> 43:28.298
Just kill one of them.

43:35.722 --> 43:37.474
Hold it!

43:38.767 --> 43:40.978
Lucky? Geez, you all right?

43:41.061 --> 43:44.189
- What happened?
- I don't know.

43:44.231 --> 43:46.191
- Here.
- Oh, geez.

43:49.194 --> 43:51.363
- Ow! Ow!
- What?

44:02.124 --> 44:04.084
Wait a second.

44:08.088 --> 44:09.173
Let me see that.

44:11.759 --> 44:14.511
Come on, come on.

44:18.765 --> 44:20.267
Oh, great!

44:20.309 --> 44:21.727
Real bullets.

44:24.813 --> 44:27.191
I'll keep this.

44:27.274 --> 44:29.651
You're in a lot of trouble,
mister!

44:48.629 --> 44:50.088
Excuse me.

44:57.596 --> 44:58.889
It's real.

45:00.349 --> 45:03.560
- What?
- This is real.

45:06.230 --> 45:08.732
- You mean...
- Yes.

45:09.816 --> 45:13.028
They're going to kill us.

45:25.624 --> 45:28.001
What am I doing in Mexico?

45:29.670 --> 45:32.798
- I've been shot already.
- I know.

45:33.966 --> 45:36.385
What are we gonna do?

45:36.468 --> 45:39.721
We're not gonna get paid,
that's for sure.

45:40.973 --> 45:43.934
Let me talk to 'em,
man to man.

45:44.017 --> 45:46.061
Yes.

45:57.239 --> 45:59.533
Mr. Guapo...

45:59.575 --> 46:03.871
I'd just like to say,
on behalf of the Three Amigos...

46:03.912 --> 46:07.624
we're very, very sorry
and we'd like to go home now.

46:14.089 --> 46:16.592
You see, sir...

46:16.675 --> 46:18.594
we're not gunfighters.

46:19.887 --> 46:21.138
We're movie stars.

46:22.056 --> 46:23.182
Movie stars?

46:23.265 --> 46:26.727
Yeah, actors, entertainers.

46:30.522 --> 46:32.941
You know, we sing and dance.

46:33.025 --> 46:35.486
Yeah, you know...

46:35.569 --> 46:37.905
<i>My little buttercup</i>

46:37.946 --> 46:40.324
<i>Has the sweetest smile</i>

46:42.785 --> 46:45.371
Don't you want to die like dogs?

46:45.412 --> 46:49.166
Well, if there's any way
of avoiding that part of it...

46:49.249 --> 46:51.919
El Guapo only kills men.

46:53.587 --> 46:56.048
He does not kill crying women.

46:57.925 --> 46:59.385
So go...

47:00.427 --> 47:02.721
you big movie stars.

47:04.848 --> 47:06.558
Thank you.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.684
Faster!

47:20.197 --> 47:21.990
People of Santa Poco.

47:24.743 --> 47:29.206
You were very foolish to bring men
to try to stop El Guapo.

47:32.501 --> 47:35.004
You have hurt me.

48:08.078 --> 48:10.122
You see, Jefe?

48:10.163 --> 48:12.458
A rose can bloom in the desert.

48:22.843 --> 48:24.678
Jefe!

48:24.762 --> 48:28.307
Santa Poco is no longer
under my protection!

48:34.355 --> 48:36.607
The town is yours, muchachos!

49:54.059 --> 49:55.352
Afternoon.

50:22.629 --> 50:26.592
- We'll just get our things and go.
- There is nothing of yours here.

50:26.633 --> 50:28.927
El Guapo has taken everything.

50:30.471 --> 50:31.597
Sorry.

50:32.973 --> 50:36.852
Did you see a pair of cuff links?
They were mother-of-pearl...

50:39.188 --> 50:40.689
Where's Carmen?

50:40.773 --> 50:43.150
El Guapo has taken her too.

50:53.786 --> 50:56.372
- Let's go back to Hollywood.
- The sooner, the better.

50:56.455 --> 50:58.916
- It's too hot down here.
- That and my hay fever.

50:58.999 --> 51:02.169
- We don't belong down here anyway.
- Where's Ned?

51:09.343 --> 51:10.803
What are you doing?

51:11.762 --> 51:14.306
What do we have to go back to?

51:14.389 --> 51:17.059
You've no jobs, no money...

51:18.143 --> 51:19.311
no place to live.

51:21.063 --> 51:23.065
No friends.

51:23.148 --> 51:24.566
No women.

51:26.318 --> 51:27.569
No self-respect.

51:27.653 --> 51:29.697
Oh, hold on. Wait.

51:29.780 --> 51:31.824
Ned, we could get killed.

51:33.909 --> 51:37.621
Back there the Three Amigos
are already dead.

51:37.704 --> 51:39.832
Here we could be
the Three Amigos for real.

51:43.878 --> 51:45.838
I'm drawing a line.

51:50.968 --> 51:53.220
Men or mice?

51:53.303 --> 51:54.555
What'll it be?

52:59.828 --> 53:01.622
Let's ride!

53:21.391 --> 53:24.895
- Great job catching the food, Ned.
- Oh, thanks, Lucky.

53:24.979 --> 53:27.439
How do you like your bat, Dusty?

53:27.523 --> 53:30.609
- Medium rare.
- This should do it.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.238
Thanks.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.504
How far did we ride before we
had to go back and get directions?

53:50.587 --> 53:52.005
Just three or four miles.

53:55.134 --> 53:56.635
Read those instructions again.

53:56.719 --> 53:58.178
All righty.

54:00.764 --> 54:02.766
All right.

54:02.849 --> 54:04.768
We go east...

54:06.103 --> 54:08.897
through the desert
until we come to the singing bush.

54:08.981 --> 54:10.983
The singing bush?

54:11.066 --> 54:13.652
When we find the singing bush...

54:13.694 --> 54:17.698
we say the magic chant,
each fire one shot in the air...

54:17.781 --> 54:20.033
and that will summon
the invisible swordsman...

54:20.117 --> 54:22.661
and he will then show us
the way to El Guapo's.

54:23.745 --> 54:25.789
- Want your wings?
- No, fine.

54:27.374 --> 54:28.500
Here you go.

54:28.542 --> 54:30.502
Oh, great, thanks.

54:34.673 --> 54:36.592
Well, good night.

54:39.386 --> 54:43.182
Look at the little fella.
He's tuckered out already.

54:46.477 --> 54:47.728
What was that?

54:47.811 --> 54:49.563
It's just a coyote.

54:52.024 --> 54:53.942
I've never slept outside before.

54:54.026 --> 54:55.569
Take it easy.

55:12.378 --> 55:15.798
<i>Arizona moon keep shinin'</i>

55:17.966 --> 55:22.054
<i>From the desert sky above</i>

55:24.097 --> 55:26.642
<i>You know, pretty soon</i>

55:26.725 --> 55:29.144
<i>That big yellow moon</i>

55:29.228 --> 55:31.146
<i>Will light the way</i>

55:31.230 --> 55:32.439
<i>Back</i>

55:32.523 --> 55:35.943
<i>To the one you love</i>

55:36.026 --> 55:39.154
<i>Blue</i>

55:39.238 --> 55:41.365
<i>Shadows</i>

55:41.448 --> 55:43.742
<i>On the trail</i>

55:50.040 --> 55:52.960
<i>Little cowboy</i>

55:53.002 --> 55:54.962
<i>Close your eyes</i>

55:56.422 --> 55:58.799
<i>And dream</i>

56:00.509 --> 56:02.511
<i>All of the doggies</i>

56:02.594 --> 56:06.306
<i>Are in the corral</i>

56:06.348 --> 56:09.685
<i>All of your work is done</i>

56:12.229 --> 56:14.440
<i>Just close your eyes</i>

56:14.481 --> 56:16.942
<i>And dream, little pal</i>

56:17.901 --> 56:20.654
<i>Dream of</i>

56:20.696 --> 56:23.991
<i>Someone</i>

56:36.045 --> 56:38.881
<i>Blue</i>

56:38.964 --> 56:41.300
<i>Shadows</i>

56:41.341 --> 56:44.345
<i>On the trail</i>

56:49.850 --> 56:52.519
<i>Soft wind blowin'</i>

56:52.603 --> 56:56.649
<i>Through the trees</i>

56:56.732 --> 56:59.902
<i>Above</i>

57:00.986 --> 57:05.032
<i>All the other little cowboys</i>

57:06.241 --> 57:10.704
<i>Back in the bunkhouse now, so</i>

57:11.872 --> 57:14.708
<i>Close your</i>

57:14.750 --> 57:18.337
<i>Eyes and</i>

57:18.420 --> 57:20.672
<i>Dream</i>

57:36.272 --> 57:39.024
Good night, Lucky.
Good night, Dusty.

57:39.066 --> 57:42.528
Good night, Ned.

57:43.487 --> 57:44.571
Good night, Ned.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.079
Good night, Lucky.

57:52.162 --> 57:54.081
Good night, Dusty.

59:39.603 --> 59:40.854
Lip balm?

59:43.565 --> 59:46.443
<i>She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain when she comes</i>

59:49.196 --> 59:51.824
<i>She'll be comin' 'round the mountain
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain</i>

59:51.907 --> 59:54.493
<i>She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain when she comes</i>

59:54.535 --> 59:58.455
<i>She'll be ridin' six white horses
when she comes, when she comes</i>

01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:04.128
<i>She'll be ridin' six white horses
She'll be ridin' six white horses</i>

01:00:04.211 --> 01:00:06.839
<i>She'll be ridin' six white horses
when she comes</i>

01:00:06.922 --> 01:00:08.006
Excuse me.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.675
Are you the singing bush?

01:00:09.716 --> 01:00:12.720
<i>Follow the sea
Yea, ho, blow the man down</i>

01:00:12.803 --> 01:00:15.139
- Pay attention and listen to me
- Let me talk to him.

01:00:15.222 --> 01:00:17.891
Excuse us.
Are you the singing bush?

01:00:17.975 --> 01:00:20.227
<i>Yea, ho, blow the man down</i>

01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:24.148
Hello? Hi!

01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.901
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down</i>

01:00:27.985 --> 01:00:29.069
Excuse us!

01:00:29.152 --> 01:00:32.364
<i>Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies</i>

01:00:33.615 --> 01:00:36.201
<i>We're gonna leave you now</i>

01:00:36.243 --> 01:00:39.580
Forget it. My guess is
this is the singing bush.

01:00:39.663 --> 01:00:41.206
Let's go summon
the invisible swordsman.

01:00:41.248 --> 01:00:45.544
Summon the invisible swordsman?
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:00:45.586 --> 01:00:49.339
<i>Over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea</i>

01:00:49.423 --> 01:00:51.008
<i>My Bonnie lies over</i>

01:00:51.091 --> 01:00:55.346
Now let me see here. We each
have to fire one shot in the air...

01:00:55.429 --> 01:00:57.347
say the magic chant...

01:00:57.431 --> 01:01:00.267
and the invisible swordsman
will appear.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:03.270
<i>Bring back, bring back</i>

01:01:03.312 --> 01:01:05.314
<i>Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me</i>

01:01:05.397 --> 01:01:07.399
Neddy!

01:01:07.483 --> 01:01:10.778
<i>Well, I got an old mule
and her name is Sal</i>

01:01:10.819 --> 01:01:12.821
<i>Fifteen miles
on the Erie Canal</i>

01:01:18.118 --> 01:01:19.578
Dusty.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.580
<i>Filled with lumber, coal and hay</i>

01:01:21.622 --> 01:01:26.001
<i>And we know every inch of the way
from Albany to Buffalo</i>

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.513
Great! You've killed
the invisible swordsman.

01:01:37.596 --> 01:01:40.766
<i>Oh, I wish I was
in the land of cotton</i>

01:01:40.808 --> 01:01:43.435
<i>Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away</i>

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:44.603
He's dead.

01:01:44.687 --> 01:01:46.647
How was I supposed to know
where he was?

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:51.443
You were supposed to fire up.
We both fired up!

01:01:51.485 --> 01:01:54.154
It's like living
with a six-year-old.

01:01:54.238 --> 01:01:56.740
Now we'll never find El Guapo's.

01:01:56.824 --> 01:01:59.201
He was the only one
who could show the way. We're lost.

01:02:03.205 --> 01:02:05.791
It's the Tuppan-601
we saw in Diablo.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:07.126
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:10.879
I'll bet it's going to El Guapo's.
Mount up!

01:02:10.963 --> 01:02:15.050
<i>Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny</i>

01:02:15.134 --> 01:02:16.385
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:18.387
It means, get on your horses.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.515
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:02:21.598 --> 01:02:24.309
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

01:02:46.874 --> 01:02:50.336
Carmen, today is
El Guapo's birthday...

01:02:50.377 --> 01:02:52.838
and tonight,
you are to be El Guapo's woman.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.424
I would sooner die.

01:02:56.508 --> 01:02:59.219
Let me prepare you
for the way El Guapo makes love.

01:02:59.303 --> 01:03:02.848
Tell me, Carmen,
do you know what foreplay is?

01:03:05.726 --> 01:03:07.728
Good. Neither does El Guapo.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.732
Jefe, the German arrive yet?

01:03:11.815 --> 01:03:16.069
Not yet, El Guapo. Many presents
have been coming for your birthday.

01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:20.199
German has the only presents
I want: Guns.

01:03:20.282 --> 01:03:25.079
Guns under the name of El Guapo
will be hanging on everyone's lips.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.705
He will be here, Guapo...

01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:30.167
but I think you will like
your other presents too.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:33.128
I have put many beautiful pinatas
in the storeroom...

01:03:33.212 --> 01:03:37.216
each of them filled
with little surprises.

01:03:37.299 --> 01:03:38.759
Many pinatas?

01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:40.886
Oh, yes, many.

01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:44.556
Would you say I have
a plethora of pinatas?

01:03:44.598 --> 01:03:46.433
A what?

01:03:46.516 --> 01:03:48.894
A plethora.

01:03:51.063 --> 01:03:53.774
Oh, yes,
you have a plethora.

01:03:53.857 --> 01:03:56.777
Jefe, what is a "plethora"?

01:03:58.237 --> 01:03:59.405
Why?

01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:01.824
You told me I have a plethora...

01:04:01.907 --> 01:04:05.410
and I just would like to know
if you know what a plethora is.

01:04:05.494 --> 01:04:08.413
I would not like to think
that a person would tell someone...

01:04:08.455 --> 01:04:10.082
he has a plethora...

01:04:10.124 --> 01:04:13.210
and find out that that person
has no idea...

01:04:13.294 --> 01:04:16.797
what it means to have a plethora.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.799
Forgive me, El Guapo.

01:04:18.882 --> 01:04:23.971
I know that I, Jefe, do not have
your superior intellect and education.

01:04:24.054 --> 01:04:26.348
But could it be that, once again...

01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:28.934
you are angry at something else...

01:04:28.976 --> 01:04:30.978
and are looking
to take it out on me?

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.605
Like what, Jefe?

01:04:32.646 --> 01:04:36.608
Could it be because
you are turning 40 today?

01:04:37.859 --> 01:04:42.990
Could it be because Carmen chooses to
sleep in her cell instead of with you?

01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:48.162
Why don't you just take her?

01:04:48.245 --> 01:04:51.164
When you want cattle,
you take the cattle.

01:04:51.248 --> 01:04:54.376
When you want food,
you take the food.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.211
When you want a woman...

01:04:56.295 --> 01:04:59.089
you just take the woman.

01:04:59.173 --> 01:05:01.175
Why don't you just take her?

01:05:03.636 --> 01:05:06.931
You do not understand women.

01:05:07.014 --> 01:05:11.643
You cannot force open
the petals of a flower.

01:05:11.685 --> 01:05:16.190
When the flower is ready,
it opens itself up to you.

01:05:17.358 --> 01:05:19.610
When do you think Carmen will...

01:05:19.693 --> 01:05:22.321
open up her flower to you?

01:05:22.404 --> 01:05:25.949
Tonight, or I will kill her.

01:05:29.494 --> 01:05:33.082
There is the German now,
right on time.

01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:37.920
We must make him welcome.

01:05:47.221 --> 01:05:49.181
This way, boys.

01:05:54.728 --> 01:05:56.146
Stay.

01:06:08.492 --> 01:06:09.577
Down.

01:06:12.454 --> 01:06:13.789
My God.

01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:21.964
We're gonna have to figure out
a way to get inside.

01:06:22.047 --> 01:06:24.049
It looks impossible.

01:06:24.091 --> 01:06:26.385
Lucky, those walls
are 25 feet high.

01:06:26.427 --> 01:06:29.263
There's a guard at every post.
There's no way we'll ever get in there.

01:06:29.346 --> 01:06:33.767
- I think Dusty's right.
- We're gonna have to use our brains.

01:06:33.809 --> 01:06:35.269
Damn it.

01:06:41.316 --> 01:06:43.277
Here come the guns!

01:07:26.487 --> 01:07:28.447
Jefe, what's his name?

01:07:29.782 --> 01:07:32.201
- That's Paco.
- Paco!

01:07:34.286 --> 01:07:35.829
Take off your hat.

01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:38.790
Hold it up!

01:07:38.874 --> 01:07:40.209
Higher!

01:07:50.427 --> 01:07:52.471
You lived up to your promise.

01:07:52.513 --> 01:07:55.307
You will be my guest
at the celebration today.

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:58.685
A little party
my men are throwing for me.

01:08:56.618 --> 01:09:00.122
- This is where we'll climb up.
- What about that guard?

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:04.752
- I'll throw a rock and distract him.
- Okay.

01:09:05.795 --> 01:09:08.755
But I would throw it out there,
maybe toward that tree.

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:10.256
Wait a second.

01:09:10.298 --> 01:09:13.426
No, in the dry riverbed.
They're...

01:09:18.307 --> 01:09:19.433
Let's go.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.484
You like it?

01:10:21.745 --> 01:10:22.788
Seize him!

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.169
So far, so good.

01:10:28.252 --> 01:10:30.545
What was that noise?

01:10:30.629 --> 01:10:32.631
I do not know.

01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:46.729
I have three demands.

01:10:46.812 --> 01:10:49.982
One: That you stop harassing
the people of Santa Poco.

01:10:50.065 --> 01:10:52.651
Two: That the land of Mexico...

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:54.528
be redistributed equally
among the people...

01:10:54.611 --> 01:10:58.198
and a proportional system
of government be established...

01:10:58.282 --> 01:11:00.826
consisting of three separate,
but equal, branches...

01:11:00.868 --> 01:11:03.787
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial.

01:11:03.871 --> 01:11:04.997
And three:

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.751
That the girl Carmen
be returned to me unharmed.

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:11.462
Amigo, why you come here?

01:11:11.545 --> 01:11:15.591
You don't belong.
Now we have to kill you.

01:11:16.717 --> 01:11:18.010
Take him away.

01:11:18.051 --> 01:11:20.554
Excuse me,
did you say kill me?

01:11:55.672 --> 01:11:59.801
Under my system, you would no longer
be under the thumb of El Guapo...

01:11:59.885 --> 01:12:03.055
but you would be free
to determine your own destiny.

01:12:03.097 --> 01:12:07.643
You see, under a strong federal system,
you have certain rights.

01:12:07.726 --> 01:12:10.229
For example, owning property.

01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:12.940
You two could have a beautiful
little castle on the mesa.

01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:15.400
You know, I can see it now,
with your little bambinos...

01:12:15.442 --> 01:12:17.110
running everywhere,
playing in the yard.

01:12:57.693 --> 01:12:59.152
- We have a plan.
- What is it?

01:12:59.194 --> 01:13:00.988
First, we break into
El Guapo's fortress.

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:02.864
And that you've done.
Now what?

01:13:04.032 --> 01:13:06.451
Well, we really didn't expect
the first part of the plan to work...

01:13:06.493 --> 01:13:08.620
so we have no further plan.

01:13:08.662 --> 01:13:11.165
Sometimes you can
overplan these things.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:13.834
So give me a second
to talk to Lucky.

01:13:13.918 --> 01:13:15.461
- I'll get back to you.
- Wait!

01:13:15.544 --> 01:13:17.546
There's a guard
outside the door.

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:55.000
Quick!
You must dress in his clothes.

01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:57.503
Then you will be able
to move freely in the courtyard.

01:13:57.544 --> 01:13:59.504
Got it.

01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:04.051
Ow! Ow! Easy.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:15.020
Come and get 'em.

01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:26.574
So I just wait here then?

01:14:29.535 --> 01:14:31.453
Okay, you go get the horses.
Meet us out front.

01:14:31.537 --> 01:14:33.455
That's a good plan.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.916
Thank you.

01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:56.121
A toast to El Guapo.

01:16:04.254 --> 01:16:07.174
Today, he is...

01:16:10.177 --> 01:16:12.554
33 years old!

01:16:24.358 --> 01:16:29.738
On behalf of myself, Jefe...

01:16:29.821 --> 01:16:32.700
and the rest of the boys...

01:16:32.783 --> 01:16:35.410
we chipped in and...

01:16:35.494 --> 01:16:38.163
got you this gift.

01:16:48.382 --> 01:16:51.009
What can you say
about such men?

01:16:58.392 --> 01:17:00.895
It's a sweater!

01:17:07.359 --> 01:17:09.277
Gonna make it.

01:17:35.596 --> 01:17:37.431
I made it!

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:44.897
My men, my compadres...

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.775
what we have done,
we have done together.

01:17:50.903 --> 01:17:54.573
I know each one of you
like I know my own smell.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:07.920
We fought together
the priests of this mission.

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:15.260
We crushed the federales
on the plains of Oaxaca.

01:18:18.305 --> 01:18:19.765
Jose!

01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:22.518
Together, we...

01:18:22.601 --> 01:18:25.020
- Burned the village!
- Burned the village!

01:18:26.146 --> 01:18:28.774
- And...
- Raped the horses!

01:18:30.943 --> 01:18:32.694
And we...

01:18:32.778 --> 01:18:35.989
- Rode off on the women!
- Rode off on the women!

01:18:36.073 --> 01:18:38.116
And...

01:18:38.158 --> 01:18:39.660
- We plundered!
- Plundered!

01:18:41.286 --> 01:18:42.955
- And...
- Pruned.

01:18:43.038 --> 01:18:46.041
- Pruned the...
- Hedges.

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:49.503
- Hedges.
- Of many small villages.

01:18:49.587 --> 01:18:54.299
Of many small villages.
Who the hell are you?

01:18:54.341 --> 01:18:58.637
- Another one of the goddamn gringos.
- Take this monkey away!

01:18:58.679 --> 01:19:01.181
Put him with the other
Yankee maricon.

01:19:01.223 --> 01:19:05.561
What is happening around here today?
Are gringos falling from the sky?

01:19:09.356 --> 01:19:10.899
Yes, El Guapo.

01:19:14.152 --> 01:19:17.406
Now we have all the Amigos.
Take 'em away.

01:19:17.489 --> 01:19:19.867
One moment, please.

01:19:19.908 --> 01:19:21.243
I know who this man is.

01:19:21.326 --> 01:19:25.206
- You do?
- Yes, it is Ned Nederlander.

01:19:25.247 --> 01:19:27.708
Who?

01:19:31.504 --> 01:19:36.175
You are my favorite star
of the silver screen.

01:19:36.258 --> 01:19:38.218
Really?

01:19:40.554 --> 01:19:45.017
In Germany, the cinema is very popular.
I've seen all of your films...

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.230
including when you were known
as "Little Neddy Knickers."

01:19:49.313 --> 01:19:51.899
Well, that was a long time ago.

01:19:51.982 --> 01:19:55.903
It was this man who inspired me
to learn the art of the quick draw.

01:19:55.944 --> 01:19:58.739
I looked up to this man.
I studied his every move.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.659
It was my dream to be as fast
as Ned Nederlander.

01:20:02.743 --> 01:20:05.454
I practiced every day
for hours and hours.

01:20:05.537 --> 01:20:07.540
He was a god to me.

01:20:07.623 --> 01:20:11.460
A god?
Well, I don't know about that.

01:20:11.544 --> 01:20:15.214
But it is nice to meet a fan.
You know, often I think...

01:20:15.297 --> 01:20:17.299
Then I found out about movie tricks.

01:20:17.382 --> 01:20:19.760
Trick photography.
I was crushed.

01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:21.470
I never used trick photography.

01:20:21.553 --> 01:20:25.349
That is impossible. No one can be
as fast as you appear to be.

01:20:25.432 --> 01:20:27.017
I am that fast.

01:20:28.435 --> 01:20:29.854
We shall see.

01:20:29.937 --> 01:20:30.980
Happy to.

01:20:31.063 --> 01:20:35.400
Does anybody have a watch?
Preferably one with a second hand.

01:20:35.442 --> 01:20:36.985
I got a stopwatch.

01:20:37.069 --> 01:20:42.074
No stopwatch. As you Americans say,
"We will play for keeps."

01:20:43.993 --> 01:20:45.953
Give me back his gun.

01:20:47.746 --> 01:20:52.126
Leave him here.
He might like to see his friend die.

01:20:52.209 --> 01:20:54.211
I've seen it.

01:21:22.281 --> 01:21:24.700
You don't understand.
I don't shoot at people.

01:21:24.783 --> 01:21:27.202
You see, it's against
my upbringing.

01:21:27.286 --> 01:21:30.038
Call it etiquette, whatever.
You know, I was thinking...

01:21:36.337 --> 01:21:38.797
I've waited for years
for this moment.

01:22:09.203 --> 01:22:12.164
You wanna die
with a man's gun.

01:22:12.206 --> 01:22:16.460
- Not a little sissy gun like this.
- Enough!

01:22:16.543 --> 01:22:18.504
Take the gun!
Let's go!

01:23:58.645 --> 01:24:00.731
I have had enough
of this, Yankees.

01:24:00.814 --> 01:24:02.691
Not so fast, El Guapo!

01:24:04.026 --> 01:24:07.196
Or I'll fill you so full of lead,
you'll be using your dick for a pencil.

01:24:09.448 --> 01:24:10.615
What do you mean?

01:24:10.657 --> 01:24:12.743
I don't know!

01:24:12.826 --> 01:24:14.912
- I think he means that if you...
- Shut up!

01:24:16.205 --> 01:24:19.958
So, you thought you could
outsmart the Amigos.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.962
Well, not this time.
Dusty, cover El Guapo.

01:24:26.507 --> 01:24:29.092
Now, everybody,
throw down your guns.

01:24:29.176 --> 01:24:31.762
Do as he says!

01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:37.142
Not you, Dusty.

01:24:37.184 --> 01:24:38.644
Sorry.

01:24:42.064 --> 01:24:47.068
Okay, now, everybody lay down
and put your hands behind your head.

01:24:49.571 --> 01:24:52.658
Ned, open the gates!

01:25:25.065 --> 01:25:27.192
And don't try to touch
those guns!

01:25:29.737 --> 01:25:31.071
Kill them!

01:25:42.082 --> 01:25:45.002
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:25:46.962 --> 01:25:49.214
Ride, Amigos, ride!

01:26:40.682 --> 01:26:44.103
What luck! It's a Tuppan-601.
You can fly one.

01:26:44.144 --> 01:26:46.438
Yeah. Didn't you fly one
in Little Neddy Goes to War?

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.483
Well, not exactly.
Actually, my stuntman did.

01:26:49.566 --> 01:26:51.568
I'm pretty sure
I can remember.

01:27:04.957 --> 01:27:08.127
- Look out, Ned.
- My God!

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.515
So long, El Guapo!

01:27:21.557 --> 01:27:24.101
I will see you in Santa Poco.

01:27:55.174 --> 01:27:56.759
Santa Poco!

01:27:58.885 --> 01:28:00.596
Ned, land.

01:28:08.395 --> 01:28:09.354
Hold it.

01:28:47.142 --> 01:28:48.560
El Guapo is on his way.

01:28:49.770 --> 01:28:53.399
Someday the people of this village
will have to face El Guapo.

01:28:53.441 --> 01:28:55.275
We might as well do it now.

01:28:56.318 --> 01:28:59.905
In a way, all of us
have an El Guapo to face someday.

01:28:59.988 --> 01:29:04.076
For some, shyness
might be their El Guapo.

01:29:04.159 --> 01:29:07.746
For others, a lack of education
might be their El Guapo.

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:09.582
For us...

01:29:09.623 --> 01:29:12.710
El Guapo is a big dangerous guy
who wants to kill us.

01:29:12.793 --> 01:29:15.963
But as sure as my name
is Lucky Day...

01:29:16.046 --> 01:29:18.006
the people of Santa Poco...

01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:20.342
can conquer their
own personal El Guapo...

01:29:20.425 --> 01:29:23.387
who also happens to be
the actual El Guapo.

01:29:24.513 --> 01:29:27.391
We want to defend ourselves.
But how?

01:29:27.475 --> 01:29:32.688
By using the skills and the talents
of the people of Santa Poco.

01:29:32.771 --> 01:29:34.356
This is not a town of weaklings.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.443
You can turn your skills
against El Guapo.

01:29:40.112 --> 01:29:42.031
Now...

01:29:42.114 --> 01:29:46.118
what is it that this town
really does well?

01:29:55.794 --> 01:29:57.295
We can sew.

01:29:57.337 --> 01:29:59.423
There you go.
You can sew.

01:30:00.716 --> 01:30:02.676
If only we had known this earlier.

01:30:02.718 --> 01:30:05.304
- Ned, Dusty.
- Sewing.

01:30:05.387 --> 01:30:08.390
Remember our film,
Amigos, Amigos, Amigos?

01:30:08.474 --> 01:30:12.144
- Yes.
- Remember what we did in that movie?

01:30:12.186 --> 01:30:15.564
- Gee, do you think it could work?
- It's got to work.

01:30:15.648 --> 01:30:17.566
It's our only hope.

01:31:03.821 --> 01:31:07.491
Sew, very old one.
Sew like the wind.

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.582
Okay, dig here.

01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:26.195
Where are you?

01:32:28.822 --> 01:32:30.741
There they are, El Guapo!

01:32:40.501 --> 01:32:42.628
Now they're over there,
El Guapo.

01:32:48.341 --> 01:32:50.052
Now they're over there.

01:32:52.179 --> 01:32:53.764
Shoot 'em!

01:32:55.515 --> 01:32:56.642
They're over there.

01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:02.189
Now they're over here.

01:33:09.696 --> 01:33:12.157
What the hell is happening
around here?

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.160
Shoot, shoot!

01:33:16.537 --> 01:33:19.123
Now they're over there,
on top of the church.

01:33:21.208 --> 01:33:22.835
They are everywhere.

01:33:22.918 --> 01:33:24.837
They're over there too.

01:33:50.612 --> 01:33:52.864
Come back, you cowards!

01:33:52.906 --> 01:33:56.243
You traitors!

01:33:58.412 --> 01:34:00.998
I'm still here, El Guapo.

01:34:17.931 --> 01:34:19.683
You stupid horse!

01:35:06.689 --> 01:35:08.899
That was some good trick.

01:35:12.194 --> 01:35:15.489
Come closer.
I have something to tell you.

01:35:25.124 --> 01:35:27.543
That was a good trick too.

01:35:37.135 --> 01:35:40.806
I'm gonna miss you,
Senor Dusty.

01:35:45.394 --> 01:35:46.979
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pablo.

01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:51.233
Here.

01:35:51.316 --> 01:35:53.235
I want you to have my watch.

01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:04.955
I wanna go with you.

01:36:05.039 --> 01:36:10.794
No, Pablo, there's still much
to be done here. Your village needs you.

01:36:10.878 --> 01:36:12.921
And your family needs you.

01:36:13.005 --> 01:36:16.675
We are men without homes.

01:36:16.758 --> 01:36:18.719
We were meant to wander.

01:36:18.761 --> 01:36:23.724
You will always have a home here
with us in Santa Poco.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.646
Good-bye, Dusty.

01:36:33.734 --> 01:36:36.611
You have done
what you said you would do.

01:36:36.695 --> 01:36:39.073
Long will the memory of the Three Amigos
live in the hearts...

01:36:39.114 --> 01:36:40.782
of the people of Santa Poco.

01:36:56.131 --> 01:36:58.508
I'll come back one day.

01:36:58.592 --> 01:37:00.511
Why?

01:37:03.263 --> 01:37:06.975
Well, I thought that maybe
you and I could...

01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:53.022
Let's ride.

01:38:04.366 --> 01:38:07.703
We are proud to give you
all that we have.

01:38:07.786 --> 01:38:09.079
Here, I'll take that.

01:38:20.007 --> 01:38:23.969
Our reward is that justice
has been done.

01:38:27.014 --> 01:38:31.143
And remember: Wherever there
is injustice, you will find us.

01:38:31.227 --> 01:38:34.313
Wherever there is suffering,
we'll be there.

01:38:34.355 --> 01:38:37.733
Wherever liberty is threatened,
you will find...

01:38:37.816 --> 01:38:40.151
The Three Amigos!

01:38:46.491 --> 01:38:47.910
Let's ride!

01:39:02.549 --> 01:39:04.510
Let's ride!

01:39:05.305 --> 01:39:11.170
