- Watch out!
- Aah!

[tires screeching]

00:04.430 --> 00:06.227
[windscreen shatters]

00:06.240 --> 00:07.593
(Spencer)
'We have one choice here.‘

00:07.600 --> 00:10.137
Make it look like
Rollins skipped town.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.960
What happened with Hanna,
it was confusing.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.063
But that's all it was.
A moment of confusion.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.229
I just need more time.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.707
I judged you too quickly.

00:16.710 --> 00:17.779
'Why don't we start over?‘

00:17.780 --> 00:19.771
Let's get dinner this week.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.771
- I'm Marco.
- I'm leaving.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.247
[moaning]

00:23.250 --> 00:25.616
You've written a really
beautiful love story for Nicole.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.281
I can finally hear
her name now

00:27.290 --> 00:29.554
without trying to...put
my fist through a wall.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.358
If we just stay calm and stick
to the plan, we'll be fine.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.351
This is about containment,
and right now

00:34.360 --> 00:35.998
'everyone who knows about
Rollins is sitting in this car.‘

00:36.000 --> 00:38.025
And by the time the police
realize that he's missing

00:38.030 --> 00:39.395
'he'll be halfway
towards Philly.‘

00:39.400 --> 00:40.628

thought I could go back

00:40.640 --> 00:41.937
in there, but] can’t.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.259
Everyone is counting on us.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.067
You promise
you'll come back for me.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.139
(Spencer)
We ﬁnd the burner phone

00:46.140 --> 00:47.539
we ﬁnd E/liotis accomplice.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.929
It's Mary Drake.
Who else could it possibly be?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.508
(Jenna)
HI} Archer. Itis Jenna.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.639
Emily, hey, I thought
you might want to stop by Ali's

00:55.650 --> 00:59.040
on your way to Hollis. They're
releasing her this morning.

00:59.060 --> 01:03.508
And I look kinda conspicuous
standing here alone.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.179
[sighs]
I still feel horrible

01:05.190 --> 01:07.055
that I ever believed
that she did it.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.722
Okay, she just got here
so call her, text her

01:09.730 --> 01:11.163
or just come by.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.963
Hi, we tried to get you out.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.130
It's okay.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.459
I figured it out.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.461
[car door opens]
Is that Jason?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.539
Nope, Jason couldn't make it.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.768
Okay, so who..

01:28.150 --> 01:29.412
A casserole?

01:29.420 --> 01:32.685
Arya, what a thoughtful
gesture. Thank you.

01:32.690 --> 01:35.181
Just, uh, little something
in case

01:35.190 --> 01:36.384
Alison does_n't wanna
cook dinner.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.324
Well, we have to ask
you around, you know

01:38.330 --> 01:40.525
sometime soon to repay
the kindness.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.997
But for now..

01:42.000 --> 01:43.319
...Alison needs her rest.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.558
I could use the company.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.094
Well, that's what
you have me for.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.193
- You're staying here?
- Doctor's orders.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.236
Terms of my release.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.867
Aunt Mary

01:51.870 --> 01:53.735
do you mind
if we have a moment?

01:54.710 --> 01:55.870
Of course.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.738
What the hell
is she doing here?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.172
After what happened
with Elliot

02:01.180 --> 02:02.818
Welby's concerned
that I'll sue

02:02.820 --> 02:06.187
so they're doing
an internal investigation and..

02:06.190 --> 02:07.543
...she's gonna be staying
with me

02:07.560 --> 02:09.755
until a social worker
can reVIew my case.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.079
She was helping him

02:11.090 --> 02:12.728
in zombie make-up.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.426
I had to get
out of there somehow.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.796
And it's easier to keep
an eye on her here.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.960
What's going on with Jenna?

02:18.970 --> 02:21.029
Do we know
why she was calling Elliot?

02:21.040 --> 02:22.837
[sighs]
Mona's got his burner phone.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.762
She's been digging around,
but we haven't heard--

02:24.770 --> 02:26.101
Ladies, I'm sorry

02:26.110 --> 02:27.600
but I really must insist.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.628
Ali...do you want me
to stay?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.538
She's just gonna keep acting
like a demented den-mother

02:32.550 --> 02:34.245
if you're here.
Leave me alone with her.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.911
I'll get some answers
and I'll check in later.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.376
I don't like this.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.642
Trust me...neither do I.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.869
[door opens]

02:58.570 --> 03:01.232
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.674
Swear this one you'll save

03:03.680 --> 03:06.240
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:06.250 --> 03:08.741
Taking this one to the grave

03:08.750 --> 03:13.949
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

03:13.960 --> 03:16.349
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:16.360 --> 03:18.885
If one of them is dead

03:21.160 --> 03:23.549
Elliot_ contacted me
In London.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.322
He told me about Charlotte.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.524
That she survived

03:26.540 --> 03:28.428
'only to be murdered.‘

03:28.440 --> 03:29.998
And that nearly shattered me

03:30.010 --> 03:31.363
having my baby given back to me

03:31.370 --> 03:34.601
in the same moment
she was taken away.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.329
'Elliot_seemed_to share
In my gnef.‘

03:37.350 --> 03:38.942
Could I get a glass of water?

03:45.250 --> 03:47.639
Elliot_and I had Charlotte
In common too.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.349
_He sucked me in
In the same way.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.225
What I don't understand

03:55.230 --> 03:57.824
is how you could agree
to help a stranger

03:57.830 --> 03:59.821
drive another person insane.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.660
Rollins was clever

04:01.670 --> 04:02.591
manipulative

04:02.610 --> 04:07.104
and I was...so vulnerable.

04:07.110 --> 04:10.534
As we consoled one another, he
began to share his suspicions.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.472
That I killed Charlotte.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.300
I did nothing
but try and help her.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.742
I didn't know you, Alison

04:15.750 --> 04:17.308
and my experiences

04:17.320 --> 04:19.584
with your mother
made it easy for me

04:19.590 --> 04:21.649
to believe you were cut
from the same cloth.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.855
And that's why you thought
I deserved to die?

04:23.860 --> 04:25.157
I never agreed to that.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.525
He told me that Charlotte

04:26.530 --> 04:27.883
wanted me to have her money

04:27.900 --> 04:30.994
and that for me
was justIce but..

04:31.000 --> 04:32.695
...he wanted vengeance.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.065
I tried to talk him
out of it

04:34.070 --> 04:35.162
but he was intent on taking

04:35.170 --> 04:36.569
an eye for an eye.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.333
And now I regret
ever believing

04:38.340 --> 04:40.558
a thing he told me.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.140
Alison, I hope that
my telling the truth

04:43.150 --> 04:45.539
will earn your forgiveness.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.743
I have so little family left.
I never should have..

05:00.630 --> 05:04.555
Do we know anything else
about...who he really is?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.463
The police know that
Elliot Rollins

05:08.470 --> 05:10.768
is a fake identity

05:10.770 --> 05:13.261
that he wasn't even
a real doctor.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.305
They're still investigating.

05:15.310 --> 05:19.201
Well, it's been quite
an emotional morning.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.201
I could use a lie down.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.040
Which way is
the guestroom, please?

05:23.050 --> 05:24.881
It's upstairs,
at the end of the hall.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.658
It's an old mattress.

05:29.690 --> 05:31.624
I hope you don't find it
too uncomfortable.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.427
I've slept on worse.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.426
If you don't mind,
I'll-I'll go upstairs now.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.635
[sighs softly]

05:46.910 --> 05:48.901
[dramatic music]

05:55.280 --> 05:57.578
Ooh it's not enough

05:58.990 --> 06:04.485
Everything we've dreamed of
it's almost time..

06:04.490 --> 06:07.027
[chuckling]

06:07.030 --> 06:08.395
Morning.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.623
You're one of those
mornIng people, aren't you?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.188
Mm.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.191
Coffee is a nice touch.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.428
It's, uh, my way of saying

06:16.440 --> 06:18.431
sorry that I talked
your ear off

06:18.440 --> 06:20.601
and kept you up all night.

06:20.610 --> 06:24.205
No, I liked getting
to know you more.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.848
I talked until
you fell asleep.

06:25.850 --> 06:29.775
Heh, guess I missed my chance
for a goodnight kiss.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.014
'Here.'

06:32.890 --> 06:34.118
For future reference

06:35.320 --> 06:37.880
I usually talk like that
when I'm nervous

06:37.890 --> 06:40.654
and when I'm waiting for
somebody to make the first move.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.062
Makes my heart beat like

06:47.070 --> 06:49.937
A marching band

06:51.640 --> 06:53.130
[cell phone chiming]

06:58.550 --> 07:00.108
- Anything important?
- No.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.179
Just my friends wanting
to meet up in the morning

07:02.180 --> 07:03.579
before I can..

07:04.420 --> 07:05.512
- Oh, my God!
- What?

07:05.520 --> 07:06.714
- Oh, no.
- What?

07:06.720 --> 07:10.019
Uh...my test started
ten minutes ago.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.054
Okay, what do you need?

07:11.060 --> 07:12.084
Just take your time

07:12.090 --> 07:13.125
finish your coffee

07:13.130 --> 07:14.427
uh, spare key's in that bowl

07:14.430 --> 07:16.091
and just, ah, lock up

07:16.100 --> 07:17.158
before you leave, okay?

07:22.140 --> 07:23.459
Bye.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.708
[keys jingling]

07:35.580 --> 07:38.708
Oh! What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting you.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.245
Yeah, I just needed
a quiet place to work.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.284
How was your trip?

07:42.290 --> 07:43.712
Uh,good"

07:45.060 --> 07:46.527
...productive.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.953
Are you...in the middle
of a thought

07:48.960 --> 07:51.497
or can I come give you
a proper hello?

07:53.400 --> 07:55.368
Hello.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.668
- I missed you.
- I missed you too

07:59.010 --> 08:01.035
Something happened
while I was away.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.329
What do you mean?

08:04.350 --> 08:07.945
I needed to get out of town
to concentrate on Liam's notes

08:07.950 --> 08:11.738
uh, but I spent a night
in New York.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.082
I went to see
NIcole's parents.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.318
Oh.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.912
I wanted them to know about us

08:16.930 --> 08:21.458
and...they needed to know that
I'm moving forward with my life.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.325
Yeah. What did they say?

08:23.330 --> 08:25.719
They were happy for me.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.994
I never understood why
they were so worried about me.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.264
They were the ones
who lost their daughter.

08:30.270 --> 08:31.999
They didn't want you
to be alone.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.238
Yeah.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.503
I just didn't know if it would
make you uncomfortable.

08:36.510 --> 08:37.738
No, I'm glad you went.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.071
I'm sure that meant
a lot to them.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.116
And it felt wrong
keeping a secret from you.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.841
So can you take a break

08:46.860 --> 08:48.851
tell me whatI missed
while I was away?

08:50.160 --> 08:51.718
Nothing much, really.

08:59.900 --> 09:00.161
Hi.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.433
No, I know, I'm sorry
I'm so late but..

09:06.440 --> 09:07.737
Okay.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.869
Oh, no.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.775
(man over police radio)
'Attention all available units.‘

09:17.790 --> 09:20.441
'Backup requested
at Malvern Station'

09:20.460 --> 09:22.280
'15 North Warren Avenue.‘

09:22.290 --> 09:25.828
'11-24 with possible 10-57.‘

09:25.830 --> 09:28.025
[indistinct chatter]

09:29.670 --> 09:31.968
Does that mean
they found Rol|Ins' car?

09:31.970 --> 09:35.462
Yeah, an 11-24
is an abandoned vehicle

09:35.470 --> 09:37.267
and that _other code is
for mIssmg persons.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.635
Yeah, except he's not missing.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.130
Well, that's the way
they're playing it.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.472
Did you see that article buried
in the back of the paper?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.799
The cops are withholding
details.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.846
Does that mean
we're screwed?

09:45.850 --> 09:47.477
No, actually. It means
that they think

09:47.480 --> 09:49.118
that he's alive
and on the run.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.576
Which means that they're
putting together the pieces

09:50.590 --> 09:52.182
exactly how we want them to.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.817
Just keep your head down.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.253
Everything's gonna be fine.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.725
What are you working on?

10:03.930 --> 10:07.297
Um, business plan
Lucas wants by tomorrow.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.790
[cell phone ringing]

10:10.040 --> 10:11.291
It's Aria.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.334
She said Mona found something

10:12.340 --> 10:13.864
on Elliot's burner phone.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.734
There's a location
besides the car

10:15.740 --> 10:17.731
where Rollins used
this phone a lot.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.047
Well, did she say
where it was?

10:19.050 --> 10:20.301
No, I guess it's hard to trace.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.140
Mona said that
it might take a while.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.242
Okay, what else?

10:23.250 --> 10:24.274
Well, she recovered

10:24.290 --> 10:26.110
his deleted text

10:26.120 --> 10:28.111
and...found this.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.353
Wait a minute,
so Rollins knew that

10:31.360 --> 10:32.884
Ali didn't kill Charlotte.

10:32.890 --> 10:35.120
He sent that the night
he took Alison out of Welby.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.792
Okay, if this text means
what I think it means..

10:37.800 --> 10:39.722
He wasn't taking Alison
somewhere to kill her.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.219
I thought we were
the ones who helped

10:41.240 --> 10:43.037
convince him All did it.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.530
Do we know
who he sent this to?

10:44.540 --> 10:46.337
No, there's no names
in the contact list

10:46.340 --> 10:49.229
and Mona thinks that
that number probably belongs

10:49.240 --> 10:50.332
to another burner phone.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.972
I mean, how much
do wanna bet that

10:52.980 --> 10:55.141
that number belongs to Jenna?

10:55.150 --> 10:57.448
Why would Jenna actually care
who killed Charlotte?

10:57.450 --> 10:58.610
I don't know.

10:58.620 --> 10:59.644
How did he know that
Ali didn't do it?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.878
I...don't know.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.858
And he can't tell us now,
can he?

11:12.470 --> 11:13.596
I would've been there
this morning, but I overslept.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.999
Late night.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.560
Shift at the bar?

11:17.570 --> 11:19.128
No, I had a date.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.801
Didn't know
you were seeIng anyone.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.175
Yeah, it's new.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.968
Okay, 23 Wexford Street,
apartment 109?

11:25.980 --> 11:27.345
We're supposed
to recognize that?

11:27.350 --> 11:28.647
I thought maybe Ali would.

11:28.650 --> 11:29.969
Mona said that's where
Rollins used his burner.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.015
Maybe, but that's not
where he lived.

11:32.020 --> 11:34.284
He rented a guest cottage
in town.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.918
Old stone carriage house
somebody converted.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.080
I thought it was so romantic.

11:39.090 --> 11:41.524
So...Rollins had a burner phone

11:41.530 --> 11:42.656
and a burner apartment?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.458
Nothing he told me was true.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.121
Not where he lived, what his
name was, where he was from.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.938
Ali, Rollins wasn't trying
to kill you that night.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.828
At least,
we don't think so anymore.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.035
That doesn't make him
any less of an ass.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.678
We don't know
who he was texting, do we?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.045
I vote Jenna.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.314
She is definitely a liar.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.548
My guess is Mary Drake.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.642
According to her story

12:06.660 --> 12:08.787
she bailed when things got..

12:08.790 --> 12:10.883
...murdery.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.426
And you believe Mary?

12:12.430 --> 12:14.523
Believe her, maybe.

12:14.530 --> 12:17.328
Trust her...not yet.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.798
Maybe we should go
to this...burner apartment.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.564
You know, maybe then we could
find out who he was texting.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.037
Yeah, and who this person is

12:24.040 --> 12:25.735
that thought
I killed Charlotte.

12:25.740 --> 12:28.607
Great idea but we can't.

12:28.610 --> 12:30.976
Hanna said it sounds like
the police found the car

12:30.980 --> 12:33.540
so maybe they've already figured
out who Rollins really is.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.519
Well, so then we need
to get there before they do.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.873
No, Aria's right.

12:37.890 --> 12:38.914
If the cops find out,
they could tie us

12:38.920 --> 12:40.182
to his disappearance.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.055
So we do nothing.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.880
It's too risky, Em.

12:45.590 --> 12:49.196
God, all those lies I told

12:49.200 --> 12:51.964
you think I would've seen
Elliot coming from a mile away.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.371
[beeping]

13:12.450 --> 13:14.008
[loud beep]

13:21.900 --> 13:23.253
[loud beep]

13:23.270 --> 13:25.261
[dramatic music]

13:35.710 --> 13:37.007
Ezra.

13:55.730 --> 13:57.925
[cell phone ringing]

14:05.910 --> 14:08.105
[ringing continues]

14:13.450 --> 14:15.372
[indistinct chatter]

14:15.380 --> 14:17.018
Hello?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.248
[chatter continues]

14:18.250 --> 14:19.478
[foreign language song
over phone]

14:19.490 --> 14:21.117
Nicole, is that you?

14:22.890 --> 14:23.914
Hello?

14:23.930 --> 14:26.626
[chatter continues]

14:31.470 --> 14:34.394
There is no explanation that
I can think of for a ghost

14:34.400 --> 14:36.937
with an_international
ca||Ing plan.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.191
What is that sound?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.007
Practicing my pisco sour.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.308
I can't get my egg whites
to froth.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.572
Why don't you just come over.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.605
We'll day drink
until you calm down.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.942
That's actually not a bad idea.

14:47.950 --> 14:51.113
[sighs]
No, just tell me what to do.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.179
Aria, Nicole is dead, okay.

14:53.190 --> 14:56.387
They had a funeral for her.
The case is officially closed.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.187
And you obviously
can't tell Ezra.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.055
What good would it do?

15:02.060 --> 15:03.357
You know,
the same thing happened

15:03.370 --> 15:05.827
about three months
after my dad died.

15:05.830 --> 15:07.127
Did you freak out?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.394
'No. But my mom did.'

15:10.410 --> 15:14.062
'She sent out boxes of clothing
and things to my cousin.‘

15:14.080 --> 15:16.969
He was in a flood
and lost almost everything.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.039
My dad's phone ended up
in one of the boxes

15:19.050 --> 15:21.348
and...without thinking about it

15:21.350 --> 15:23.671
'my cousin used my dad's phone
to call my mom.‘

15:23.690 --> 15:26.648
And it looked like
your dad was calling her.

15:30.090 --> 15:32.320
[sighs]
I'll delete the call.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.525
I think it's for the best.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.554
Bye.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.404
Mm..

15:49.280 --> 15:50.338
[beeps]

15:58.290 --> 15:59.382
[beeps]

15:59.390 --> 16:01.210
[dramatic music]

16:07.400 --> 16:08.958
[beeping]

16:09.800 --> 16:11.051
Hey, Spence.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.298
I'm sorry. I really hate
to bug you with this

16:12.300 --> 16:14.222
but I've been trying
to find Caleb.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.935
'He hasn't been returning
messages or calls'

16:15.940 --> 16:17.669
'for the past couple of days.‘

16:17.670 --> 16:19.001
Are you at the State Park?

16:19.570 --> 16:20.832
Yeah.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.628
Did you drive to the parking lot
at the Laura campground?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.947
That's the one that Caleb likes.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.679
Yeah, I tried there,
and I tried the trail hut

16:27.680 --> 16:30.513
that ends at the falls and
the bait and tackle shop too.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.580
Well, you can try
the ranger station.

16:33.590 --> 16:36.115
I mean, he'd have to have a
day pass if he's camping there.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.127
Hanna?

16:41.700 --> 16:42.951
Do you see this?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.291
She's still here.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.628
Yeah, follow her.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.268
We have no idea
why she's back in town

16:48.270 --> 16:50.693
or why she called
Rollins' phone.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.701
If she really was working
with Rollins

16:52.710 --> 16:55.270
we can't risk Jenna figuring out
that we're on to her.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.577
She can't see you following her.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.808
It's not like
she has working eyes

16:57.810 --> 16:58.845
in the back of her head.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.169
'I'm talking about the cops.‘

17:00.180 --> 17:01.977
Me acting normal
doesn't include

17:01.980 --> 17:05.518
tiptoeing around behind a girl
with a big white cane.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.114
I think I have another way
to check up on Jenna.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.485
Ranger station, go.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.754
I'll call you
ifI find anything.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.250
Okay, thank you.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.295
"Thank me later,
ungrateful bitch."

17:19.030 --> 17:21.021
Alright, can we day drink,
just a little?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.895
Right now, we're thinking,
not drinking.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.561
Well, there's something
bugging me about this text.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.437
You know, why would A.D.
do me any favors?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.204
I don't know, and I don't
even wanna think about

17:32.210 --> 17:34.303
what you're gonna have
to do to repay the debt.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.817
I'm not gonna wait around for
AD. to twist my arm with this.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.310
Em..

17:40.320 --> 17:42.652
'Okay, I-I really don't think
you should do that.‘

17:49.660 --> 17:51.127
[cell phone beeps]

17:52.130 --> 17:54.121
Is it Jenna?

17:54.140 --> 17:55.732
No, it's just a number.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.134
"The usual spot."
Where the hell is that?

18:02.140 --> 18:04.608
There's only one place
I can think of.

18:04.610 --> 18:05.838
The burner apartment.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.369
What if the cops show up?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.414
Well, hopefully, we'll find out

18:11.420 --> 18:12.819
who is helping Rollins first.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.287
Whether it's Mary Drake
or Jenna Marshall.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.086
If we have something
to hand over to the cops

18:15.090 --> 18:16.114
there's no more A.D.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.348
How are we supposed to get in?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.782
Seatbelts first,
question's later--

18:18.790 --> 18:20.883
Hi. Hey, I was just
thinking about you.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.925
Hey, Sabrina.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.522
- Aria, right?
- Yeah.

18:24.530 --> 18:27.419
Hey. Um, nice to see you, again.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.161
Um, well, you guys are going
somewhere, I don't wanna keep--

18:31.170 --> 18:32.706
No, it's fine. We're..

18:34.180 --> 18:37.206
Okay. Uh, I was just wondering
how your test went?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.804
It was good. Great.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.445
Okay.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.385
Uh, well, I have
some deliveries to make.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.415
Our guy didn't show so..

18:48.420 --> 18:49.455
Okay.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.550
Sorry, that was really awkward.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.891
Oh, come on.
We need to get there first.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.435
[breathing heavily]

19:05.740 --> 19:07.264
[glass shattering]

19:13.080 --> 19:14.775
Did Elliot leave
this mess for you?

19:14.780 --> 19:17.044
- 'I can help you tidy up.'
- Where is it?

19:17.050 --> 19:18.312
You tell me
what It Is you're after

19:18.320 --> 19:19.810
I can help you find it.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.742
You know what I'm after.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.887
You helped him take it,
and now it's all gone.

19:26.030 --> 19:28.590
- He double-crossed me.
- What are you talkIng about?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.556
That lying bastard
was just greedy.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.697
Are you sure
that he took everything?

19:32.700 --> 19:34.793
Checkings, savings,
joint accounts

19:34.800 --> 19:36.336
my safety deposit boxes

19:36.340 --> 19:37.898
and my shares
at the Carissimi Group.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.934
It's all gone!

19:38.940 --> 19:40.407
Okay, okay.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.173
He must have used
his power of attorney

19:42.180 --> 19:43.909
to empty the accounts
and escaped

19:43.910 --> 19:46.606
but...the police will find him.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.601
You'll get your money back.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.342
What if they don't find him?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.011
Alison, I'm so terribly sorry.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.349
Just tell me what it is

19:59.360 --> 20:00.486
that you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.785
I wanna make this right.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.392
I can't sleep in here.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.295
[sighs]

20:08.300 --> 20:10.495
[dramatic music]

20:38.970 --> 20:40.619
[knocking]

20:41.940 --> 20:44.158
_ I'd like to file
a mIssmg persons report.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.468
Official or off the record?

20:46.470 --> 20:49.906
Help me, Toby Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.072
I'm sorry.
It was a terrible joke.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.672
I don't even know why..

20:57.220 --> 20:58.676
That means
he's staying with you.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.580
No, but you know where he is.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.829
Caleb just needs
some time to think.

21:05.830 --> 21:08.958
Okay. He'll reach out to you
when he's ready.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.329
This is messy. I'm sorry.
I didn't..

21:13.330 --> 21:14.365
Sorry you got pulled into it.

21:14.370 --> 21:18.488
He's my friend...so are you.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.206
If you want, I can tell him
that you stopped by and--

21:21.210 --> 21:22.837
No! No, no, no.
Thank you though.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.536
Um, I should, I should go.
I was just..

21:25.550 --> 21:27.040
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.109
Hey. Hi there.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.678
Hi.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.511
- Have you guys met?
- No. I don't think we have.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.251
Okay. Um, Spencer Hastings,
this is Detective Marco Furey.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.920
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, you as well.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.194
Uh, well, I'm sure you guys
have a lot of work to do

21:45.200 --> 21:47.293
so I will let you get to it.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.838
[indistinct chatter]

21:56.540 --> 21:58.531
Right over here in the..

22:02.820 --> 22:04.412
This doesn't fit..

22:05.920 --> 22:07.740
[knocking]

22:20.800 --> 22:23.496
Jenna. What a treat?

22:23.500 --> 22:27.607
Alison? I thought
you were in the hospital.

22:28.410 --> 22:30.571
So you came to my house.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.844
To find out how you were doing.

22:32.850 --> 22:33.839
Oh.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.477
I figured
you wouldn't wanna see me

22:35.480 --> 22:38.313
but I didn't think
there was any harm in..

22:38.320 --> 22:39.912
...asking your husband.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.315
Elliot doesn't live
here anymore.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.754
- Did something happen?
- You tell me.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.250
You seem to know
a lot about what's happening

22:49.260 --> 22:50.818
in my private life.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.262
How do you and Elliot
know each other?

22:54.270 --> 22:59.765
Um...this was a mistake.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.465
Your mistake was trying
to convince him

23:01.480 --> 23:03.368
that I killed Charlotte.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.448
You haven't been well, Alison.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.839
I think you're confused.

23:09.850 --> 23:10.919
Am I?

23:12.450 --> 23:14.088
The next time you call Archer

23:14.090 --> 23:15.785
tell him I said to go to hell!

23:17.530 --> 23:19.555
Maybe he's already there.

23:33.170 --> 23:36.628
Do you think $20 was enough
to keep the manager quiet?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.733
I slipped him a number two.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.310
Well, number two,
Imperial Garden.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.810
I hope he likes moo-shu..

23:55.400 --> 23:57.027
What a dump.

23:59.570 --> 24:02.027
It's like Rollins
was two different people.

24:03.670 --> 24:06.400
Yeah, or someone else
was living here.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.708
Well, whoever it is
is a slob.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.769
The sink is disgusting.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.771
Hey, help me pull down
the Murphy bed.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.348
[metal rattles]

24:20.350 --> 24:21.647
It's stuck.

24:29.130 --> 24:30.427
[gasps]
Oh, my god!

24:30.430 --> 24:32.762
It's a head. It's a head.
It's a head.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.065
- Whose head?
- I don't know.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.765
I don't wanna know.
I can't look at that.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.568
Em. No, don't touch it.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.172
Oh, it's not real.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.802
The fall broke the face off.

24:49.420 --> 24:52.514
Who keeps a fake head stuffed
under their pillow?

24:57.830 --> 25:00.526
Someone pretending
to be Darren Wilden.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.819
(bartender)
'What can I get you?‘

25:08.840 --> 25:11.559
John Collins, rocks, extra sour.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.606
(bartender)
'Sure thing.‘

25:13.610 --> 25:14.963
(Jenna)
'Is this seat taken?‘

25:14.980 --> 25:18.609
The bar looks
pretty empty to...me.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.477
Oh. I'm sorry.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.869
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.025
You're Sara Harvey,
aren't you?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.127
I'm Jenna Marshall.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.530
I think a few of the girls
you know

25:42.540 --> 25:44.758
are a few of the girls I know.

25:44.770 --> 25:48.308
What an unfortunate thing
for us to have in common?

25:48.310 --> 25:51.575
Well, the unfortunate things
make us who we are.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.311
Can I buy you a drink?

25:57.690 --> 26:00.181
Only if you'll have one
with me.

26:00.190 --> 26:01.839
Are you a sour girl?

26:04.490 --> 26:06.048
Well, I can be.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.522
Bartender, she'll have the same.

26:09.530 --> 26:11.657
Four cherries, please.

26:11.670 --> 26:12.898
(bartender)
'Coming right up.'

26:15.540 --> 26:17.963
[water bubbling]

26:17.970 --> 26:20.165
Are you putting your hands
in there?

26:20.170 --> 26:22.035
You're the one sitting
on the bed.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.178
There's something at the bottom.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.579
What is that?

26:32.820 --> 26:35.948
Elliot wasn't a slob.
ThIs mess was a cover.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.556
You're not gonna believe
what happened

26:39.560 --> 26:41.050
while you were gone.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.829
Aria and Emily found out that
Rollins has a secret apartment.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.229
They didn't go there, did they?

26:47.230 --> 26:49.027
They set a trap for Jenna.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.837
Well, get this,
I used my mom's password

26:50.840 --> 26:53.035
to get in the
Radley reservation system.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.861
- Jenna just extended her stay.
- Here?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.677
She was supposed
to check out this morning

26:57.680 --> 26:59.341
but I guess something
changed her mind.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.578
Things happen, Hanna.

27:00.580 --> 27:02.502
I mean, people change
their plans.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.317
Remember when we were
only supposed to come back

27:04.320 --> 27:05.776
for a couple of days,
and we ended up

27:05.790 --> 27:06.848
in this fricking nightmare

27:06.850 --> 27:08.078
that's kept us trapped here.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.682
I'm sorry.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.885
So no luck
at the ranger station?

27:13.230 --> 27:15.551
Can we please
not talk about Caleb.

27:15.560 --> 27:19.599
[sighs]
Spence, I don't wanna be
the one who messed this up..

27:19.600 --> 27:21.090
...for either of you.

27:22.870 --> 27:26.931
So...what can I do?
How can I fix this?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.576
Maybe you can start
by figuring out

27:31.580 --> 27:32.877
why you're wearing
one guy's ring

27:32.880 --> 27:35.007
when you might have feelings
for another.

27:42.890 --> 27:45.950
Passports with no photos,
a couple of plane tickets.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.349
It's_ like Rollins had
an eXIt strategy in place

27:48.360 --> 27:50.055
for him and someone else.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.558
What's in that book?

27:52.570 --> 27:54.265
It's a ledger.
Couple of things.

27:54.270 --> 27:57.489
For a big doctor, his
handwriting is super legible.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.569
'And he kept
very detailed records.‘

27:59.570 --> 28:01.936
'Cash payments to MD. and J.M.'

28:01.940 --> 28:04.079
Mary Drake and Jenna Marshall.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.900
He was paying them cash,
but for what?

28:05.910 --> 28:08.447
I don't know. There-there's
no reference here to AD.

28:08.450 --> 28:09.747
Where did you find that?

28:09.750 --> 28:11.047
Over there on the seat cushion.

28:11.050 --> 28:12.312
Pretty sure mice lived in there.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.380
Also, I found
his personal library.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.289
"Archer Dunhill."

28:30.970 --> 28:31.789
A.D.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.038
[footsteps approaching]

28:42.250 --> 28:43.740
[gasps]

28:47.490 --> 28:50.152
(man)
'Open up! Rosewood PD.
Open up.'

28:50.160 --> 28:52.185
[slamming the door]
'I know you're in there.‘

28:56.630 --> 28:57.858
(Emily)
'Toby.

29:01.670 --> 29:03.399
You wanna tell me
why you're here?

29:03.400 --> 29:04.890
Alison found a slip of paper

29:04.910 --> 29:07.128
with this address
on it at her house.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.199
So we told her
that we would check it out.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.132
Do you have this slip of paper?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.802
We left it with her.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.281
You guys haven't been anywhere

29:28.300 --> 29:30.359
near Malvern Station lately,
have you?

29:33.230 --> 29:36.461
- No. Why?
- We found Rollins' car.

29:36.470 --> 29:39.064
A receipt for six months
advance rent on this place

29:39.070 --> 29:41.163
was in the glove box.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.932
This guy's on the run.
He's dangerous.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.079
What if he'd been hiding
out here?

29:47.520 --> 29:50.239
Listen, my new boss
is waiting to hear from me.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.115
When he does,
he's gonna come by here

29:52.120 --> 29:53.280
with a couple of detectives.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.315
He's gonna comb
through this place.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.856
You can't be here.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.050
Did you touch anything?

30:03.160 --> 30:04.252
Um..

30:17.280 --> 30:19.134
You got five minutes
before I call it in.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.551
[humming]

30:34.900 --> 30:36.219
I didn't hear you leave?

30:37.460 --> 30:39.997
Oh, I took a walk around
the neighborhood after I ate.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.959
There's a...particular shade
of blue in the evening sky.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.232
It settles me.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.505
Have you eaten? I could heat up
some of your friend's casserole.

30:49.510 --> 30:50.977
The song you were humming..

30:52.250 --> 30:55.276
...my mom used to sing that
to me as a lullaby.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.373
"Little Sparrow."

30:57.380 --> 30:59.848
Your mom and I used
to fall asleep to that song.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.956
Your grandmother used
to sing it to us.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.257
It came to mind
while I was out walking.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.649
I don't know
what brought that up.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.151
'Though I suppose
when I think about the lyrics--'

31:10.160 --> 31:12.799
There's not a lot
of birds out at night.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.928
This song is about love, Alison.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.432
About men...and lies.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.035
'"All you maidens
hede my warning'

31:23.040 --> 31:25.235
'"never trust the hearts of men'

31:25.250 --> 31:28.003
'"they will crush you
like a sparrow'

31:28.020 --> 31:31.239
leaving you to never mend"

31:32.690 --> 31:35.045
I obviously
wasn't paying attention.

31:36.490 --> 31:38.879
Kind of explains a lot.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.779
I've made
those same mistakes myself

31:41.800 --> 31:43.529
one time or another.

31:43.530 --> 31:45.521
[cell phone ringing]

31:54.170 --> 31:57.037
Alright. I may read
a little before bed.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.439
Goodnight.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.474
Goodnight.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.074
'Good evening.‘

32:06.090 --> 32:07.489
'This is Detective Marco Furey'

32:07.490 --> 32:09.617
'from the
Rosewood Police Department.‘

32:13.730 --> 32:16.028
Detective Furey?

32:16.030 --> 32:18.555
You've been assigned
to lead the investigation?

32:18.570 --> 32:20.424
I thought it was time we met.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.159
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Rollins.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.331
Uh, DiLaurentis, please.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.662
Right. I'm sorry.
Please have a seat.

32:29.910 --> 32:32.629
We got a call
from your bank's branch manager.

32:34.180 --> 32:37.172
I, um, I told them
to let me handle that.

32:37.180 --> 32:38.613
Well, the amount of money
in question

32:38.620 --> 32:40.315
requires mandatory reporting.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.652
I can only help if you let me.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.584
I wasn't trying
to make things difficult.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.726
Ijust..

32:50.970 --> 32:52.426
I was surprised.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.866
I understand.
He put you through hell.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.735
And I'm sure the news
at the bank today

32:57.740 --> 32:59.765
was a little overwhelming.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.204
But it did help us
work up a theory.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.701
And we think that your husband
targeted you for your money.

33:04.710 --> 33:08.202
It seems that he was passing
himself off as a Dr. Rollins

33:08.220 --> 33:11.109
ever since Charlotte DiLaurentis
was admitted to Welby.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.480
All of it,
just so that he could..

33:18.130 --> 33:19.552
After you were incapacitated

33:19.560 --> 33:22.484
in the psychiatric facility,
he took off.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.219
An after-hours ticket kiosk
at the Malvern Station

33:25.230 --> 33:28.427
recorded Rollins' purchase
of a train ticket.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.534
And now we know what happened
when he got off that train.

33:33.470 --> 33:37.076
Oh, um, where do you,
you think he is?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.674
Elliot R_o|lins was last seen
In BaltImore.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.905
Seen?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.979
Oh, a credit card
under his assumed name

33:44.990 --> 33:46.343
was used to rent a car.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.183
Driver was then later
captured on a trafﬁc cam

33:49.190 --> 33:51.750
heading west on Interstate 70.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.182
But I'm still waiting
for a positive ID

33:53.190 --> 33:54.487
from the rental agent.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.252
I mean, he could be
anywhere by now.

33:56.260 --> 33:59.593
Well, we shared his plate
information and description

33:59.600 --> 34:02.125
with the local authorities
and highway patrol

34:02.140 --> 34:03.630
as far west as Denver.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.369
[echoing]

34:06.810 --> 34:08.266
Miss DiLaurentis, this guy

34:08.280 --> 34:11.408
_he's turned
your entIre life upside down.

34:12.210 --> 34:13.802
I won't stop until we find him.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.448
[echoing]

34:16.750 --> 34:20.789
And two Red Eyes and one of
those lattes with soy. Thanks.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.018
Hey, can I interrupt?

34:34.030 --> 34:35.861
Hey, uh, yeah.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.360
I know I said I would call

34:37.370 --> 34:39.907
but I thought
I better do this in person.

34:39.910 --> 34:41.059
- Y_eah.
- LIsten

34:41.080 --> 34:42.229
when I saw you
earlier today--

34:42.240 --> 34:43.434
I was a complete weirdo.
I get it.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.475
You don't have to have the talk.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.606
No, Sabrina, I was in a rush--

34:45.610 --> 34:48.078
Really, there is...
zero obligation.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.308
It was just a date.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.776
It was a first date.
I mean, It was good--

34:50.780 --> 34:53.487
Okay, look, look, look.
I'm not here to have "the talk."

34:53.490 --> 34:56.414
I wanted to ask you out again.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.854
Oh. Okay.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.488
Um, yeah, that is..

35:01.500 --> 35:04.355
This is much better than a call.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.397
- I'm free on Saturday.
- Great.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.695
[sighs]

35:18.180 --> 35:20.740
(woman)
'I did, yeah. It was..'

35:22.820 --> 35:24.811
[dramatic music]

35:25.890 --> 35:27.414
Thanks.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.796
That's a lot of coffee.
Late nIght study session?

35:40.530 --> 35:43.738
(Sara)
'I heard you were finishing up
college at Hollis.‘

35:43.740 --> 35:44.661
How did you hear that?

35:44.670 --> 35:46.467
(Jenna)
'Toby mentioned it.'

35:46.470 --> 35:49.530
Must feel good to come home
and finish what you started.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.673
I should get back to the hotel.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.908
Goodnight.

36:03.220 --> 36:05.586
Rollins stole from you?

36:05.590 --> 36:08.286
I'm completely broke.
He took everything.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.891
This just keep getting worse.

36:11.900 --> 36:16.564
Guys, we deliberately pointed
the cops towards Philly.

36:16.570 --> 36:18.060
'That's where this trail
was supposed to end.‘

36:18.070 --> 36:19.367
So this means..

36:19.370 --> 36:23.204
Somebody knows.
Somebody knows what I did.

36:23.210 --> 36:24.700
Henna, you're not alone in this.

36:24.710 --> 36:27.304
[exhales forcefully]
I'm gonna be sick.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.639
God, when she panics like that,
I can't even think.

36:31.650 --> 36:34.710
[cell phone ringing]
Sorry.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.955
I'll just..
I'll put it on vibrate.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.882
Is Mary Drake behind this?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.458
'Is she trying
to let the cops know'

36:44.460 --> 36:46.257
'that the whole trail
we set up was fake?‘

36:46.270 --> 36:47.669
(Alison)
'I honestly don't think so.‘

36:47.670 --> 36:49.160
I mean, she's been
at the hospital

36:49.170 --> 36:50.592
the past few days
helping me get out.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.329
I don't think she had time
to go to Baltimore.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.932
What about Sara and Jenna?

36:53.940 --> 36:56.670
I mean, who even knew that
Sara Harvey was still in town.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.535
Maybe Sara is keeping
an eye on us for Jenna.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.108
That could be why
she's been here all this time.

37:01.110 --> 37:03.476
(Aria)
'It's too strange
to be a coincidence.‘

37:03.480 --> 37:05.277
The two people
with the biggest ax

37:05.290 --> 37:07.178
to grind against us
are-are teaming up

37:07.190 --> 37:08.748
to chop our alibi to bits.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.285
We'd know for sure it was them
if someone had showed up

37:11.290 --> 37:12.609
at the apartment today.

37:14.130 --> 37:15.722
'probably scared them away.‘

37:18.570 --> 37:20.526
Okay. I didn't tell
you guys earlier

37:20.530 --> 37:22.395
but I really screwed up today.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.803
Jenna showed up at the house
asking for Elliot

37:30.810 --> 37:33.301
and now I think she knows
that we're on to her.

37:33.310 --> 37:34.641
[phone vibrates]

37:34.650 --> 37:36.470
'Thanks to me, she knows
about the burner phone'

37:36.480 --> 37:38.038
and I'm pretty sure
she can figure out

37:38.050 --> 37:39.312
that he wouldn't just give it

37:39.320 --> 37:40.344
to us without a fight.

37:40.350 --> 37:41.942
[phone vibrates]

37:41.960 --> 37:44.554
You guys, um, it's Ezra.

37:46.930 --> 37:49.387
'Something happened today.‘

37:49.400 --> 37:51.994
- I have to go.
- Right now, Aria?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.696
I'm sorry. Yeah. I have to go.

37:56.270 --> 37:57.692
It's ﬁne.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.937
Little sparrow

38:05.950 --> 38:09.408
Little sparrow

38:09.420 --> 38:13.174
Precious fragile

38:13.190 --> 38:15.511
Little thing

38:16.620 --> 38:20.386
Little sparrow

38:20.390 --> 38:23.951
Little sparrow

38:23.960 --> 38:27.361
Flies so high

38:27.370 --> 38:31.192
And feels no pain

38:31.200 --> 38:34.465
All ye maidens

38:34.470 --> 38:38.270
Hede my warning

38:38.280 --> 38:41.738
Never trust

38:41.750 --> 38:45.709
The hearts of men

38:45.720 --> 38:48.985
They will crush

38:48.990 --> 38:53.017
You like a sparrow

38:53.030 --> 38:56.124
Leaving you

38:56.130 --> 38:59.327
To never mend

38:59.330 --> 39:02.993
They will vow

39:03.000 --> 39:05.662
To always love you

39:06.940 --> 39:10.068
Swear no love

39:10.080 --> 39:14.039
But yours will do

39:14.050 --> 39:15.301
Then they'll..

39:15.320 --> 39:16.400
Ezra!

39:16.420 --> 39:21.039
...leave you for another

39:21.050 --> 39:26.829
Break your little heart
in two

39:26.830 --> 39:28.058
Ezra!

39:58.730 --> 40:01.528
- You look--
- Confused.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.493
Oh, I was gonna say beautiful.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.866
What's going on?

40:06.870 --> 40:09.623
Well, I'm gonna talk

40:09.640 --> 40:12.131
um, for a little bit at least

40:12.140 --> 40:14.859
and then you're going to listen.

40:16.010 --> 40:17.830
Then it'll be
your turn to talk.

40:21.350 --> 40:23.204
You told me once a long time ago

40:23.220 --> 40:28.647
that you couldn't...imagine
your life without me

40:28.660 --> 40:30.958
and I told you
that I wanted you in mine

40:30.960 --> 40:33.827
and that we would,
we would figure something out.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.124
And then we spent years apart,
a world apart.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.394
Five years later
when you walked in the door

40:45.410 --> 40:48.299
after all that time

40:48.310 --> 40:52.508
it felt like, it felt like
the last flat stretch of track

40:52.510 --> 40:54.978
of a roller-coaster ride..

40:54.980 --> 40:56.504
...right before it comes
to a stop

40:56.520 --> 40:58.738
where...your stomach's

40:58.750 --> 41:00.115
flipping out
and your knees are weak

41:00.120 --> 41:03.044
but you can...breathe again.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.786
That's when I knew..

41:08.730 --> 41:11.858
....I want you in my life,
Aria, for the rest of my life.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.863
I don't ever wanna let you go.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.532
Ezra.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.303
Wait, I have..

41:22.310 --> 41:23.834
...just one more thing to say.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.578
Aria Marie Montgomery..

41:35.160 --> 41:36.582
...will you marry me?

41:48.900 --> 41:51.892
(Sara)
'This has to be our last round.‘

41:51.910 --> 41:55.732
So a toast to friends
new and old.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.605
Who's the extra for?

41:57.610 --> 41:59.578
Babes and booze.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.639
It's like you were
expecting me.

42:02.450 --> 42:03.940
NoelKahn.

42:05.050 --> 42:06.119
Did you miss me?

42:06.990 --> 42:07.809
[chuckles]

42:07.820 --> 42:09.913
No one has to know

42:09.920 --> 42:13.583
There's something
in the shadows

42:20.970 --> 42:23.962
