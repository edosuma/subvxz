WEBVTT

00:58.523 --> 01:02.160
Aah!

02:23.608 --> 02:25.642
Oh, my God.

02:27.311 --> 02:29.913
Oh, my God.
That mean what I think it means?

02:30.014 --> 02:32.583
Ha, ha! We fixin' to be parents!

02:32.682 --> 02:34.918
Yeah!

02:39.257 --> 02:40.458
Hey.

02:40.558 --> 02:42.959
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
What's wrong?

02:43.060 --> 02:45.795
Nothin'. I'm... I'm not
good enough to be a mom.

02:45.896 --> 02:46.998
I'm doin' too many drugs.

02:47.098 --> 02:49.167
No, no, no, no. You'll be fine.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.434
You'll be fine, baby.

02:50.535 --> 02:51.744
You're gonna be
such a good mother.

02:51.768 --> 02:53.171
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

02:53.271 --> 02:56.040
I hope so.
You're gonna be such a good dad.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.575
Yeah, you're gonna love it,
honey.

02:57.674 --> 02:59.443
But we gotta stop doing...
using, okay?

02:59.544 --> 03:02.079
No more... no more using.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.820
Babies come out real hurt.
Yeah, yeah, no.

03:03.914 --> 03:06.050
Sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

03:06.150 --> 03:07.717
I-I'm just gonna... I'm gonna...

03:07.817 --> 03:09.129
I want to give our baby
everything in the world,

03:09.153 --> 03:10.588
whatever they want, you know...

03:10.687 --> 03:13.957
a-a Big Wheel, a pony, right?

03:14.058 --> 03:15.469
I don't want them...
I don't want them

03:15.493 --> 03:17.028
to want for nothin', you know?

03:17.128 --> 03:18.608
Wait. How are we gonna
pay for a baby?

03:18.695 --> 03:20.665
We can't even pay
our phone bill.

03:20.764 --> 03:22.699
We can't even buy food.

03:22.799 --> 03:24.635
Uh, hey, I'll get a job.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.437
Who's gonna hire you right now?

03:26.537 --> 03:27.704
No one's hiring in the COVID.

03:27.804 --> 03:31.309
Hey, just don't think
like that, okay?

03:31.409 --> 03:35.479
Belle, I'm gonna take care
of you, okay?

03:35.580 --> 03:38.149
You know that, right? Hmm?

03:38.249 --> 03:39.383
You trust me?

03:39.483 --> 03:40.850
You ain't got no money, Casey.

03:40.951 --> 03:42.653
- No, no, no, shh.
- Maybe I should just...

03:42.752 --> 03:45.789
No, no, no, no! No.

03:45.889 --> 03:48.459
I can do this, okay?

03:48.559 --> 03:50.760
I <i>will</i> do this.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.697
Don't you worry, okay?

03:52.796 --> 03:54.831
It's what I have always wanted,
Belle.

03:54.931 --> 03:57.068
Now, let me just...
let me figure...

03:57.168 --> 03:59.403
let me figure this out, okay?

03:59.503 --> 04:01.505
Just...

04:02.540 --> 04:04.642
No, Casey!

04:04.741 --> 04:07.978
We can't do that no more.

04:08.079 --> 04:09.980
You're gonna be a daddy.

04:10.081 --> 04:14.418
You gotta get in the straight
and narrow, okay?

04:14.518 --> 04:17.688
No more drugs.

04:17.786 --> 04:20.957
Casey. Yeah.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.060
Yeah, you're right, Belle.
You're right, Belle.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.962
We gotta get on
the straight and narrow.

04:26.063 --> 04:27.931
That's what we'll do.

04:28.032 --> 04:29.710
That's what we'll do.
And you'll get a job?

04:29.734 --> 04:31.402
Yeah. Yeah, I promise.

04:31.502 --> 04:33.170
Yeah. I'll get a job.

04:33.271 --> 04:35.939
I-I'm gonna talk to my dad,
see if he'll maybe...

04:36.040 --> 04:39.809
maybe he'll give me some money,
maybe he'll give me a job.

04:39.909 --> 04:41.712
I think he will.

04:41.811 --> 04:43.381
Yeah. He needs the help.

04:43.481 --> 04:45.525
And... And the lady he works
for, she got a lot of money,

04:45.549 --> 04:47.051
but she don't pay much.

04:47.151 --> 04:49.553
- Jobs, jobs.
- Exactly, exactly, yeah.

04:49.654 --> 04:54.325
I think, yeah, that should work.

04:54.425 --> 04:55.626
It'll work, right?

04:55.726 --> 04:57.827
I don't know.
You think it'll work?

04:57.927 --> 05:00.031
Yeah, yeah, I do. I do.

05:00.131 --> 05:02.199
Don't worry, baby.
You can count on me.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.335
All right? Okay?

05:06.570 --> 05:08.306
Count on me.

05:08.406 --> 05:11.409
I'll do anything for you.
All right?

05:27.692 --> 05:29.226
You scared me!

05:29.327 --> 05:30.561
You okay?

05:30.661 --> 05:32.263
No, I'm running late.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.032
You're still going?

05:35.132 --> 05:37.101
Yeah, I have to speak to my mom,

05:37.201 --> 05:39.470
and we have those estate papers
to sign,

05:39.570 --> 05:41.372
and then she keeps asking me

05:41.472 --> 05:43.040
if there's anything
of my dad's I want.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.842
I should come out and get it,
and...

05:48.079 --> 05:51.515
I can't believe I'm never gonna
get to speak to him again.

05:57.154 --> 05:59.590
Why don't I come with you?

05:59.690 --> 06:00.866
What about that
big presentation?

06:00.890 --> 06:02.293
I can push it. All right?

06:02.393 --> 06:04.628
Being with you right now...
that's what's important.

06:04.729 --> 06:06.163
Yay!

06:06.263 --> 06:08.632
Oh, I was hoping you'd ask.

06:08.733 --> 06:11.168
- I know.
- Thank you.

06:11.268 --> 06:12.636
Well, don't think me yet.

06:12.737 --> 06:14.705
You know how your mother
and I can get.

06:14.805 --> 06:17.108
No discussing politics.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.809
We're in D.C. What do you mean?

06:18.908 --> 06:19.908
Politics, come on.

06:19.976 --> 06:21.878
No poking the bear.

06:24.515 --> 06:26.950
Fine.

06:27.051 --> 06:28.861
I'm gonna get changed,
and I'll throw some things

06:28.885 --> 06:30.020
in the bag, okay? Okay.

06:30.121 --> 06:31.622
You gonna tell her we're coming?

06:31.722 --> 06:33.567
- No, I want to surprise her.
- Why would you surprise her?

06:33.591 --> 06:34.692
My mother loves surprises.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.160
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.696
Okay.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.631
All right.

07:01.085 --> 07:03.053
Hey, Mama.

07:07.091 --> 07:10.795
I know I can't bring you back,
but...

07:10.895 --> 07:13.130
I plan to make you proud.

07:15.399 --> 07:18.002
I'm gonna be a daddy.

07:20.504 --> 07:22.606
And I'm gonna give her
the best life.

07:26.243 --> 07:28.412
Things will change.

07:31.148 --> 07:33.083
Life will be better.

07:35.052 --> 07:36.620
I promise.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.669
I love you, Mama.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.394
Hey, Dad.

08:50.494 --> 08:52.530
How you been?

08:55.399 --> 08:59.169
What'd I tell you
about comin' around here?

08:59.270 --> 09:01.305
I wanted to see you.

09:04.475 --> 09:07.311
I can't lend you
any more money, son.

09:07.411 --> 09:09.113
I'm sorry.

09:11.749 --> 09:15.486
Just a few dollars?

09:15.586 --> 09:18.656
Please?

09:18.756 --> 09:21.825
Dad, come on. I-I ain't got
no one else to go to.

09:24.261 --> 09:26.597
Can you at least get me a job?

09:31.036 --> 09:33.103
Mrs. Dixon would never hire you,

09:33.203 --> 09:36.373
and the shape you're in, I...

09:36.473 --> 09:39.910
I can't say I'd ask her to.

09:40.011 --> 09:42.079
Why? What are you talkin' about?

09:42.179 --> 09:44.748
Son, you need help.

09:44.848 --> 09:45.983
I'm fine, Dad.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.652
I just need some money
and a job,

09:48.752 --> 09:50.554
just money and a job, can...

09:52.356 --> 09:55.292
Some money and a job, Dad.
Come on, please?

09:55.392 --> 09:57.995
Can't you help me, please?

09:58.095 --> 09:59.797
Please?

09:59.897 --> 10:01.032
- I can't.
- Please.

10:01.131 --> 10:02.733
- I won't.
- I'm desperate, Dad!

10:02.833 --> 10:05.502
I told you the last time,
it was the last time.

10:05.603 --> 10:08.672
- What am I supposed to do?!
- Get cleaned up!

10:08.772 --> 10:10.608
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.576
Not my problem!

10:17.881 --> 10:21.585
I'm hungry. Belle and I
don't got no money for food.

10:21.685 --> 10:24.855
Oh, man.

10:24.955 --> 10:28.059
How is Annabelle?

10:28.158 --> 10:31.128
She's pregnant.

10:31.228 --> 10:33.330
You're fixin' to be a grandpa.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.366
- Oh, man.
- That's... That's...

10:35.466 --> 10:38.936
That's why I need money.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.638
Okay, I want to be a good dad.

10:40.738 --> 10:44.009
I-I will be.

10:44.109 --> 10:45.409
I want to get better.

10:45.509 --> 10:50.814
I-I don't want my kid
to look at me like this,

10:50.914 --> 10:52.650
look at me like you do.

10:56.087 --> 10:58.455
You get clean,

10:58.555 --> 11:00.391
I'll be happy to ask Mrs. Dixon

11:00.491 --> 11:02.459
about a job for you,
but until then,

11:02.559 --> 11:04.728
the answer's gonna be no.

11:07.865 --> 11:11.168
Whatever. Screw you.
You're just a gardener.

11:12.569 --> 11:15.873
Thank God your mother isn't
alive to see you like this.

11:20.644 --> 11:23.014
Why'd you have to say that, huh?

11:23.114 --> 11:24.281
Why would you say that, Dad?

11:24.381 --> 11:26.084
- Son, calm down.
- What's wrong with you?

11:26.216 --> 11:27.394
Why would you say that to me,
huh?

11:27.418 --> 11:28.738
Huh?
Why would you say that to me?

11:28.819 --> 11:30.187
What's wrong with you?
II'm sorry!

11:30.287 --> 11:32.157
You know I was with Mom
when she died.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.025
<i>I</i> was taking care of her!
Where were you?

11:34.125 --> 11:35.201
I was the one
who took care of her.

11:35.225 --> 11:36.527
- Calm down.
- Where were you?

11:36.627 --> 11:38.729
Looking for the bottom
of a bottle.

11:40.597 --> 11:42.666
The hell you say.
The hell you say.

11:42.766 --> 11:45.269
Why would you kick me
when I'm down, Dad?

11:45.369 --> 11:47.005
I'm your son, Dad.
No, you're not.

11:47.105 --> 11:49.339
You are my embarrassment.

11:53.377 --> 11:56.014
I have to get back to work.
Please get some help.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.881
I'm sorry, son. Screw you!

12:01.318 --> 12:03.154
Hey, Hugh.

12:03.253 --> 12:07.291
I'm about ready to go
to the airport.

12:07.391 --> 12:09.760
I'm on the way.

12:58.408 --> 13:00.544
She never uses that cane
like I tell her to.

13:00.644 --> 13:03.981
Can't believe she slipped
and fell in her own house.

13:04.082 --> 13:05.649
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's fine,

13:05.749 --> 13:08.719
but I'll have to go
stay with her for a few days.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.089
To be honest, it feels like
I haven't seen anyone

13:11.189 --> 13:12.523
since all the COVID nonsense,

13:12.623 --> 13:16.094
so I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

13:16.194 --> 13:19.164
By the way, was that Casey?

13:19.264 --> 13:20.764
Uh, yes, ma'am, it was.

13:20.864 --> 13:22.704
He knows he's not supposed
to come around here.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.934
I told him that.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.171
No need to apologize, Hugh.

13:26.271 --> 13:27.671
How's he doing?

13:27.771 --> 13:31.308
Well, when his mama died,
he went off the rails.

13:31.408 --> 13:32.819
You know, she meant the world
to him,

13:32.843 --> 13:35.512
and, you know,
when she wasn't there for him,

13:35.612 --> 13:37.414
I don't know, he just went nuts,

13:37.514 --> 13:39.383
and I didn't know
how to be there for him.

13:39.483 --> 13:42.920
And him being the spitting
image of his mama, well...

13:43.021 --> 13:46.356
it just kills me to see him,
especially when he's...

13:46.456 --> 13:51.296
Anyway, you probably need to
get on the road.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.364
Mrs. Dixon,
I need to ask you something.

13:56.633 --> 14:00.138
Could you see your way
to maybe hiring my kid,

14:00.238 --> 14:02.840
like, giving him a job,
hiring him?

14:04.775 --> 14:08.146
I'm sorry. I don't want to
put you on the spot.

14:08.246 --> 14:09.613
You know,
maybe a little hard work

14:09.713 --> 14:12.116
is just what your boy needs.

14:12.217 --> 14:15.919
I'd be happy to hire Casey,
on a trial basis, of course.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.989
Ah, you'd do that, ma'am?
Thank you so much.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.524
Oh, my goodness.

14:20.624 --> 14:22.169
I mean, I can't guarantee
anything, but I can say that,

14:22.193 --> 14:25.696
you know, deep down inside,
he's a really good kid.

14:25.796 --> 14:28.665
I know.
I-I trust your judgment, Hugh.

14:28.765 --> 14:30.601
You bring Casey on
as you see fit,

14:30.701 --> 14:32.936
but it's up to him to make
the best of it, you know.

14:33.037 --> 14:34.172
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

14:34.272 --> 14:36.840
Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.010
So I'll see you Monday.
I'll be back Monday.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.211
- Okay.
- See you then.

14:40.311 --> 14:41.487
Thank you, ma'am. Drive careful.

14:41.511 --> 14:44.481
- Okay, I will.
- All right.

What? You get a job?

15:14.478 --> 15:16.580
- No, no.
- Huh?

Listen, baby,
I promise I'll stop using,

15:27.225 --> 15:29.093
but I-I got an idea, okay?

15:29.193 --> 15:32.763
What is it?

15:32.863 --> 15:34.232
What's that?

15:40.038 --> 15:41.772
We rob that old lady.

15:41.872 --> 15:44.508
What?
What are you talkin' about?

15:44.608 --> 15:46.643
Just that old lady
my dad works for.

15:46.743 --> 15:48.445
She's so rich.
What do you think?

15:48.545 --> 15:49.680
I think you're crazy.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.082
No, no, no,
it ain't crazy, baby.

15:51.182 --> 15:52.950
We'd be set, all right?

15:53.051 --> 15:55.119
She's got so much jewelry,
she wouldn't even notice.

15:55.219 --> 15:58.056
Just one necklace, one ring...
change our life.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.924
All right?
Our baby never want for nothin'.

16:01.025 --> 16:02.759
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.396
She... She'd grow up
like a princess.

16:05.495 --> 16:06.997
The world would be her oyster.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.000
Yeah, she'd never suffer
like we suffered.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.070
Huh? How you know this?

16:12.170 --> 16:15.273
Everyone in town knows
about Mrs. Dixon.

16:15.373 --> 16:16.773
You ain't never heard of her?
No.

16:16.873 --> 16:18.751
She's always walking around
dressed to the nines,

16:18.775 --> 16:20.777
wearing some big, fancy jewels.

16:20.877 --> 16:22.546
Is she rich like Dolly Parton?

16:22.646 --> 16:24.982
- Yeah, just like Dolly, baby.
- Mm.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.218
What do you think? Huh?

16:27.318 --> 16:30.021
I don't know.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.223
We ain't no thieves.

16:32.323 --> 16:35.393
Listen, this is our chance,
okay,

16:35.492 --> 16:37.794
to get the hell out of here,
all right?

16:37.894 --> 16:40.298
People like us... we don't get
the opportunity to do that,

16:40.398 --> 16:42.300
but this one's ours.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.635
We gotta take it, okay?

16:45.736 --> 16:47.238
You really think we could do it?

16:47.338 --> 16:48.739
Oh, 100%.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.550
She just left town for few days.
Ain't no one there.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.110
- What about your daddy?
- Ah, he...

16:52.210 --> 16:54.491
he ain't got no business there
in the middle of the night.

16:54.544 --> 16:57.514
- Hmm.
- Come on, it'll be so easy.

16:57.614 --> 16:59.649
What do you think, huh?
You trust me?

16:59.750 --> 17:03.021
- I think you're crazy.
- Yeah, but do you trust me?

17:03.121 --> 17:04.820
Huh? Do you?

17:04.921 --> 17:08.059
'Cause I need you to trust me.

17:08.159 --> 17:11.329
I trust you.

17:11.429 --> 17:14.964
I'd do anything for you, baby.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.101
Anything.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.693
Surprise!

17:45.595 --> 17:47.398
Mom?

17:47.498 --> 17:49.233
It's me.

17:51.202 --> 17:52.769
Mom, you here?

18:01.245 --> 18:04.515
I wonder where she is.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.584
Mom, you out here?

18:07.684 --> 18:10.321
Where is she? Huh.

18:14.591 --> 18:17.928
Hmm. I wonder where she is.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.497
Maybe she's out running errands.

18:19.596 --> 18:21.631
Huh.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.901
Hey, Juliette!

18:25.002 --> 18:26.571
Hugh!

18:26.670 --> 18:27.904
Sorry to startle you.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.440
I didn't know you were comin'.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.750
Well, we wanted to surprise Mom.

18:30.774 --> 18:32.343
Do you know where she is? Yes.

18:32.443 --> 18:35.946
Unfortunately, your Aunt Kathy
slipped and fell at her house,

18:36.047 --> 18:37.415
and your mom went
to stay with her

18:37.515 --> 18:40.251
until your cousin
could get there.

18:40.351 --> 18:41.552
I-Is she okay?

18:41.651 --> 18:43.954
- I think so, yeah.
- Okay.

18:44.055 --> 18:46.491
Well, I'll leave you two be.
I'm just checkin' on stuff.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.092
Okay.

18:48.192 --> 18:52.163
Hugh, thank you for taking
such wonderful care of my mom.

18:52.263 --> 18:53.531
Of course.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.242
If you need anything,
I'll be over in the mill

18:55.266 --> 18:56.601
for a few hours, okay?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.269
Okay. Good seeing you.

18:58.369 --> 19:00.071
You, too.

19:02.806 --> 19:04.275
Well, I guess
it's just you and me.

19:04.375 --> 19:08.012
We got the place to ourselves.

19:08.112 --> 19:11.149
Let's open a bottle of wine.
Yeah.

19:11.249 --> 19:13.251
Yeah!

19:13.351 --> 19:15.453
We'll wait a few hours.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.121
Ain't no one awake at 4:00 a.m.

19:17.221 --> 19:19.656
Oh, yeah, that's smart.
That's real smart.

19:19.756 --> 19:22.160
I'm telling you, Belle,
startin' tomorrow,

19:22.260 --> 19:24.195
it's a whole new life.

19:24.295 --> 19:27.031
Water's always warm.

19:27.131 --> 19:29.000
We're gonna teach our kid
how to swim.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.100
Hmm.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.968
It'll be margaritas and sunsets.

19:32.069 --> 19:35.705
- Ah, sounds like heaven.
- Don't it?

19:35.805 --> 19:38.808
How nice would it be
to wake up by the beach,

19:38.909 --> 19:42.246
and you... you hear waves,
and you...

19:42.346 --> 19:44.382
shhhhhhhh...

19:44.482 --> 19:45.682
- Yeah.
- shhhhhhhhh.

19:45.782 --> 19:48.486
- Shhhhhhhhhhh.
- Shhhhhhhhhhh.

19:48.586 --> 19:51.255
Yeah. Well, just think...

19:51.355 --> 19:54.592
next week, we'll be
sittin' on the beach.

19:54.691 --> 19:57.495
Mm. I'm already there.

19:57.595 --> 19:59.096
God, I love you.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.631
Love you, too.

20:13.411 --> 20:16.913
Would have loved
to have grown up here.

20:17.014 --> 20:19.584
It was magical.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.953
Um, we used to, uh,
swim in the pond

20:23.054 --> 20:25.789
and play hide-and-seek
in the forest.

20:25.889 --> 20:27.058
Hide-and-seek?

20:27.158 --> 20:28.858
Did anybody find anyone?
It's huge.

20:28.959 --> 20:32.296
Well, games lasted a very
long time, but I usually won.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.531
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.631 --> 20:35.032
- Mm. Miss Princess...
- Mm-hmm.

20:35.132 --> 20:37.702
- In the woods.
- Hey, you.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.279
Daddy even taught
this little princess

20:39.303 --> 20:42.206
how to hunt and fish
in those woods.

20:52.949 --> 20:55.453
I loved him so much.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.192
To your dad.

21:21.512 --> 21:24.015
You ready for this?

21:24.115 --> 21:26.250
You sure they ain't home?

21:26.350 --> 21:28.653
Yeah, I'm sure, baby. It's fine.

21:28.753 --> 21:32.390
If the crick don't rise,
it ain't gonna rise.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.492
In and out, easy-peasy.

21:34.592 --> 21:38.129
Just grab a few pieces
of jewelry and skedaddle.

21:38.229 --> 21:40.964
Sound good?

21:41.065 --> 21:43.334
- Easy-peasy.
- Yeah.

21:43.434 --> 21:45.369
I'm just scared.

21:45.469 --> 21:49.240
Hey, don't be, okay?

21:49.340 --> 21:53.010
Just keep thinking,
"Mexico, here we come.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.879
"Mexico, here we come." Okay?

21:55.979 --> 21:57.114
Mexico, here we come.

21:57.214 --> 21:58.592
Just keep thinking that,
okay, baby?

21:58.616 --> 22:00.651
- Okay.
- All right. You ready?

22:00.751 --> 22:02.053
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

22:02.153 --> 22:03.554
Okay.

22:18.069 --> 22:19.869
I ain't never done
something like this.

22:19.969 --> 22:21.772
Just relax.

22:28.978 --> 22:31.915
Wow. This place is huge!

22:32.016 --> 22:34.785
Think... it's just
their country home.

22:34.884 --> 22:36.620
What if they got
one of those alarms?

22:36.721 --> 22:39.156
Fancy places like this
always got one of them alarms.

22:39.256 --> 22:42.560
They ain't got no alarm.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.261
Why?

22:44.362 --> 22:45.730
Never needed one.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.932
Everyone in town knows this
place used to host fox hunts.

22:49.033 --> 22:53.337
Place is stocked up
more than an armory.

22:53.437 --> 22:55.439
Everyone's too afraid
to get shot up.

22:55.539 --> 22:58.275
You mean they kill
all the baby foxes?

22:58.376 --> 23:02.946
Oh, I know, baby.
Ain't that messed up?

23:03.047 --> 23:07.284
Hey, don't worry.
No one's home, all right?

23:07.385 --> 23:08.719
Let's go.

23:33.811 --> 23:35.279
Hey, she left the lights on.

23:35.379 --> 23:37.415
You know... you know,
she might be home.

23:37.515 --> 23:40.950
Nah, rich people always leave
their lights on, Belle.

23:41.051 --> 23:42.586
I know she's not here.

23:53.097 --> 23:55.032
Shh. Oh, no.

23:57.001 --> 23:58.002
I'm just kidding.

23:58.102 --> 24:00.271
That's not funny, Casey.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.070
What was that?

24:33.170 --> 24:34.872
Wake... Wake up.
I heard something.

24:34.971 --> 24:37.374
What?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.677
I heard glass breaking
downstairs.

24:39.777 --> 24:41.712
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

24:58.362 --> 25:00.631
Wow.

25:00.731 --> 25:02.600
These people are rich.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.268
Told you.

25:11.242 --> 25:12.676
Did you hear that?

25:12.776 --> 25:13.978
Hear what?

25:14.078 --> 25:16.313
I swear to God,
I think I heard something.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.182
Maybe your mother came home.

25:18.282 --> 25:21.218
My mother came home
and broke a window?

25:37.768 --> 25:39.470
Okay, wait... wait here.

25:39.570 --> 25:40.905
Wait here.

25:52.950 --> 25:54.451
- See? I told you.
- Okay, wait here.

25:54.552 --> 25:57.922
- There's someone down there.
- Where are you going?

25:58.023 --> 25:59.590
Just wait here.

26:31.889 --> 26:34.025
This place is like a maze.

26:54.144 --> 26:55.746
Look at this, Belle.

26:55.846 --> 26:58.049
This here is Dandy-Q.

26:58.148 --> 26:59.850
- Wow.
- Yeah.

27:03.153 --> 27:05.723
I'll bet there's a safe
in this room.

27:29.847 --> 27:31.915
Shh!

27:32.017 --> 27:34.618
What was that?

27:34.718 --> 27:36.487
Did you hear that?

27:42.926 --> 27:44.361
Call 911.

27:44.461 --> 27:46.530
I don't have any reception.

27:48.465 --> 27:51.069
- You're freaking me out.
- 'Cause I'm freaked out.

28:05.616 --> 28:07.518
Are there any guns in the house?

28:07.618 --> 28:10.187
They're all in
the hunting cabinet.

28:15.426 --> 28:17.628
Somethin' don't feel right.

28:17.728 --> 28:20.531
C-Can we please just
get the jewelry and go?

28:20.631 --> 28:22.399
Somethin' don't feel right.

28:28.539 --> 28:30.674
Can we please get the jewelry
and just go?

28:30.774 --> 28:31.775
Fine.

28:37.981 --> 28:39.550
Did you hear that?

28:39.650 --> 28:41.985
There's definitely someone
in the house.

28:44.388 --> 28:47.458
That ain't gonna be in here.
Let's go.

28:50.627 --> 28:53.430
Any signal?

28:53.530 --> 28:56.867
There's... There's a landline
in the office.

28:58.836 --> 29:00.205
Okay.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.568
Shh.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.255
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

29:50.354 --> 29:51.522
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

29:51.622 --> 29:53.124
What the hell are you doing
in here?!

29:53.224 --> 29:55.425
- No, no, no, no!
- You little bastard!

29:55.526 --> 29:57.294
- No! Oh, God.
- Stop!

29:57.394 --> 29:58.395
- I'm sorry!
- Calm down!

29:58.495 --> 30:01.065
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it!

30:01.166 --> 30:02.933
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Hey!

30:10.808 --> 30:13.443
Daniel?

30:13.544 --> 30:15.846
Are you okay? Are you okay?

30:15.946 --> 30:17.248
What?

30:17.347 --> 30:20.684
Daniel? Are you okay?

30:20.784 --> 30:22.719
What?

30:22.820 --> 30:24.688
Daniel?

30:30.327 --> 30:31.695
Um...

30:31.795 --> 30:34.265
Daniel?

30:34.364 --> 30:37.268
Daniel? Daniel?

30:37.367 --> 30:40.305
Wake up.
Wake up, Daniel. Daniel?

30:40.404 --> 30:42.207
- Come on, man.
- Daniel.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.817
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Daniel!

30:43.841 --> 30:46.311
- Wake up, please, please.
- Oh, wake up.

30:46.410 --> 30:47.778
- Please, please, no.
- Wake up.

30:47.878 --> 30:50.148
Get away from him!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.482
I'm sorry. I ju... I just...

30:52.583 --> 30:55.419
Daniel, Daniel, wake up.

30:55.519 --> 30:58.056
Daniel, wake up. Wake up.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.292
Wake up, Daniel. You can't go.

31:01.391 --> 31:02.635
I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

31:02.659 --> 31:04.928
- You idiot.
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

31:05.029 --> 31:07.898
Daniel. Is he breathing?

31:07.998 --> 31:10.301
Daniel, oh, my God. No!

31:10.400 --> 31:13.503
- I'm sorry.
- No! No!

31:13.604 --> 31:15.906
We... We need to
call an am-ambulance.

31:16.007 --> 31:17.841
We need to call...
No. What are you doing?

31:17.941 --> 31:19.676
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- No! No!

31:19.776 --> 31:21.222
- What are you doing?!
- Give me that.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.447
- What are you doing?!
- No!

31:25.716 --> 31:28.186
Wh-Why did you do that?

31:28.286 --> 31:29.820
He needs help.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.757
Just... Just tell us where
the jewelry is, and we'll go.

31:33.857 --> 31:36.327
What... What are you
talking about?

31:36.426 --> 31:38.196
What jewelry?

31:38.296 --> 31:39.997
W-Where's the jewelry?

31:42.633 --> 31:44.801
Says a girl
who comes from money.

31:47.571 --> 31:50.874
No. Come on, Casey.
Let's just go.

31:53.443 --> 31:56.214
Ca...

31:56.314 --> 31:58.548
Casey?

31:59.983 --> 32:03.420
I-I knew you
when you were little.

32:05.189 --> 32:08.892
She knows who we are, Casey.
What are we gonna do?

32:27.678 --> 32:30.315
No, Casey. No, no.

32:49.599 --> 32:52.070
No, Casey.

32:55.806 --> 32:57.241
<i>No.</i>

32:57.342 --> 32:59.776
No, Casey. No, no.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.350
No!

33:18.229 --> 33:20.164
No, no.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.433
I told you I didn't mean it.

33:22.532 --> 33:25.336
Please. Aah!

33:41.486 --> 33:42.853
She knows what happened.

33:42.953 --> 33:45.023
She's for sure to tell the cops.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.291
I knew it. I knew we shouldn't
have done this.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.725
Yeah, but we did, Belle. We did.

33:48.825 --> 33:50.705
There's no changing it.
So what are we gonna do?

33:50.761 --> 33:52.596
I don't know. I don't know.

33:52.696 --> 33:54.731
Hey, uh, I know I can't let her
tell the cops.

33:54.831 --> 33:56.833
I can't do that.
I can't go to prison.

33:56.933 --> 33:58.403
I won't.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.104
There's gotta be
a way out of this.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.671
Think, Casey.

34:01.772 --> 34:03.174
Maybe we just go to Mexico.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.951
We keep her tied up
and so she don't tell a soul.

34:04.975 --> 34:06.686
No! My dad will find her
before we even cross

34:06.710 --> 34:07.911
the state border, okay?

34:08.012 --> 34:10.214
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

34:10.313 --> 34:11.547
I don't know. Just...

34:11.648 --> 34:13.784
What do you mean,
you don't know, Casey?

34:13.884 --> 34:15.918
You said this was easy-peasy.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.554
You said we were gonna
go to Mexico.

34:17.654 --> 34:19.223
What happened to Mexico, huh?

34:19.322 --> 34:21.068
None of that happens, though,
baby, if she tells the police.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.768
Now, please, just give me
a minute to figure this out.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.362
I just need a minute.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.728
Maybe she won't tell the police.

34:25.829 --> 34:27.206
Maybe we let her go.
She won't say nothing.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.741
She's for sure gonna
tell the police, okay?

34:28.764 --> 34:30.833
I done killed her husband.
I know that.

34:30.934 --> 34:34.038
- Please just let me go.
- Shut up!

34:34.138 --> 34:36.840
It was an accident, right?
I won't tell anyone.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.452
That's what you said.
It was an accident.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.877
You didn't mean it, right?

34:42.913 --> 34:44.215
Right?

34:44.315 --> 34:46.683
I just want to go to Mexico.

34:46.783 --> 34:50.654
The margaritas and the sunsets,
you remember?

34:50.754 --> 34:52.023
Margaritas and sunsets.

34:52.123 --> 34:55.259
Baby, baby, there's only way
to guarantee

34:55.359 --> 34:56.927
she won't tell the police.

34:57.027 --> 34:59.896
- What's that?
- Just one way.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.765
What? What are you saying?

35:01.865 --> 35:06.970
I'm saying we can't raise
no kid from prison.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.872
- You're not saying that.
- Yeah.

35:08.972 --> 35:11.242
You know what this is.
No, Casey.

35:11.342 --> 35:12.477
- Yes.
- I don't think

35:12.577 --> 35:13.857
you're thinkin' right.
Yes, I am.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.080
- No, Casey.
- It's the only way we can do it.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.482
- No.
- Yes.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.417
- Casey, no.
- Now we have to, okay?

35:19.517 --> 35:20.827
Casey, that was not part
of the plan!

35:20.851 --> 35:22.086
I don't want to, but...

35:22.186 --> 35:25.722
Shh! We have to do this
for our kid, okay?

35:27.624 --> 35:29.293
- I don't want a kid no more.
- Then what?

35:29.393 --> 35:30.603
You think I want
to kill someone?

35:30.627 --> 35:31.827
- No.
- We don't have a choice!

35:31.895 --> 35:34.664
- No.
- God, I wish you would get...

35:34.764 --> 35:37.101
Please, please, Casey,
please listen to me

35:37.201 --> 35:40.871
just this once, please, Casey,
please, just this once.

35:40.971 --> 35:43.608
Please just listen to me,
please!

35:46.943 --> 35:49.846
Okay, I'm doing this for us,
all right?

35:49.946 --> 35:51.449
You gotta trust me.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.885
I'm only doing this 'cause
I love you, and I love her.

35:54.985 --> 35:58.589
I love our baby, right?

35:58.688 --> 36:01.292
Okay, look at me.
You gotta trust me.

36:01.392 --> 36:03.528
All right? All right?

36:03.628 --> 36:06.930
You gotta trust me
on this, okay?

36:09.133 --> 36:11.102
Okay.

36:11.202 --> 36:14.472
Trust me.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.074
Okay, good.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.942
All right, baby.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.713
Ah.

36:23.813 --> 36:26.750
- How are you gonna do it?
- I don't know.

36:30.687 --> 36:32.523
You know, I'm gonna find
the jewels first.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.925
All right? Take this.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.662
Make sure she don't leave, okay?

36:37.761 --> 36:39.263
Watch her.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.543
I can't raise a baby on my own.

37:25.643 --> 37:27.877
I-I need him.

37:27.978 --> 37:29.980
T-The baby need a daddy.

37:34.151 --> 37:37.954
You're pregnant, and you're
robbing my mom's home?

37:38.055 --> 37:41.659
We're doin' this so we can
make a life together.

37:41.758 --> 37:43.793
You're never make a life
with him.

37:43.893 --> 37:45.162
How can you?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.764
Look at him.
Look at what he's doing.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.369
I know you don't want
to do this.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.737
You don't have to.

37:52.836 --> 37:54.605
Just stop talkin'.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.773
Please don't do this.

37:56.873 --> 37:58.175
Mind your own business, lady.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.711
- Please!
- Just <i>stop</i> talkin', okay?!

38:00.810 --> 38:03.614
You don't... You don't get it.
We... It's already happening.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.516
He done made up his mind.

38:10.787 --> 38:15.126
He's manipulating you.
Don't you see that?

38:29.674 --> 38:32.809
You have to think about yourself
and your future child.

38:32.909 --> 38:35.979
- I am.
- But you're not!

38:36.080 --> 38:39.383
Please don't do this.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.218
You can still get out.

38:44.854 --> 38:45.889
How?

38:45.989 --> 38:48.192
Just let me go.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.859
Can't.

38:49.959 --> 38:51.295
Can't do that.

38:51.395 --> 38:54.098
You can still say my...
my husband's death was...

38:54.198 --> 38:57.635
was an accident, but you'll
never get away with murder.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.136
You'll never get out of prison.

38:59.236 --> 39:00.504
We ain't goin' to prison, lady.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.373
We goin' to Mexico.

39:02.473 --> 39:05.176
You will if you do this.

39:05.276 --> 39:08.512
And your kid will never
see you, ever.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.367
Listen to me.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.735
I'm a lawyer.

39:30.835 --> 39:34.505
I've seen hundreds of cases
like this.

39:34.605 --> 39:37.742
A jury will never convict you.

39:37.842 --> 39:41.645
They will know
whose idea this was.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.214
No. No.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.616
I wouldn't never turn on him.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.151
You don't have to.

39:47.251 --> 39:50.920
They will know it was his idea.

39:51.021 --> 39:52.390
What you mean?

39:52.490 --> 39:54.625
You ever been arrested?

39:54.725 --> 39:57.328
No.

39:57.428 --> 40:00.464
Then you'll get off
with a slap on the wrist.

40:02.966 --> 40:07.371
But if you kill me,
then your life is over.

40:07.471 --> 40:10.474
Are you ready for that?

40:10.574 --> 40:12.176
Are you?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.529
Ugh.

40:34.964 --> 40:38.869
It's obvious you don't want
to do this.

40:38.968 --> 40:41.806
You have to think about yourself
and your child.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.074
He never will.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.044
What kind of man takes
his pregnant girlfriend

40:47.144 --> 40:50.281
to rob a house?

40:50.381 --> 40:54.218
Is that someone you really
want to raise a child with?

40:59.989 --> 41:02.059
Ugh.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.666
Ugh! Ugh!

41:19.543 --> 41:21.812
It's perfect.

41:54.879 --> 41:56.046
Belle!

41:59.083 --> 42:00.951
I told you, we hit the jackpot.

42:01.051 --> 42:02.953
Oh, my God! You found it!

42:03.087 --> 42:04.367
There's got to be
at least $7,000

42:04.455 --> 42:06.991
maybe even $10,000
worth of jewelry here.

42:07.091 --> 42:08.726
Oh, my God.

42:08.826 --> 42:10.961
Holy moly. Now, wait.

42:11.061 --> 42:12.396
- Oh, wow.
- Hold on one second.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.766
Hold on one second. Oh, my God!

42:15.866 --> 42:18.335
- Annabelle Marie Downey...
- What?

42:18.435 --> 42:20.538
I loved you ever since
I saw you picking out

42:20.638 --> 42:23.774
your cotton candy
at the state fair.

42:23.874 --> 42:29.346
Will you make the happiest man
in Loudon County and marry me?

42:32.616 --> 42:35.653
Yeah.

42:35.753 --> 42:36.987
Yeah, I will.

42:37.087 --> 42:38.522
I love you.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.462
Oh, my God! I'm so excited.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.798
We gonna have the best life
together.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.212
We just gotta take care
of one more thing.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.609
Just wait one second.
Maybe talk, and then...

43:01.679 --> 43:04.481
We gotta kill her.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.984
No, Casey. I-I can't.
She won't tell nobody.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.687
- She will.
- I won't. I won't. I won't.

43:09.787 --> 43:12.122
See? She won't, okay?
She's not gonna tell nobody.

43:12.222 --> 43:15.026
She will, Belle.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.161
- Casey.
- Give me that fire poker.

43:20.731 --> 43:23.001
- Casey.
- No, no, no, no.

43:23.100 --> 43:25.336
Casey, you listen to me.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.947
You listen to me right now.
Belle, shh.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.339
- No, no.
- Casey, wait.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.541
She's a smart lady.
We used to play together.

43:30.641 --> 43:34.311
I-I know your father.
Please, please.

43:34.411 --> 43:35.579
- Casey.
- Please, God, no.

43:35.679 --> 43:37.514
- She's a real smart lady.
- Belle, Belle.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.850
I need you to be quiet, okay?
You listen to me right...

43:39.950 --> 43:41.185
- Shh.
- Please.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.920
We can do something else,
I promise.

43:43.021 --> 43:45.856
- Please, no.
- Belle.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.658
- Please, no.
- Listen, Casey.

43:47.758 --> 43:50.160
This ain't you, Casey.
Casey, you know this ain't you.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.438
I'm not gonna let you do it,
Casey!

43:51.462 --> 43:52.896
Would you please just shut up?!

43:52.997 --> 43:54.240
And I need to take care
of this, okay?

43:54.264 --> 43:58.335
No, no, no, no.

43:58.435 --> 44:00.371
Casey, if you just...
what the heck, Casey?!

44:00.471 --> 44:02.007
It's the only way
to get better now.

44:02.107 --> 44:04.274
- Please, no.
- Casey! Oh, my God! No!

44:04.375 --> 44:06.243
- You need to shut up!
- No!

44:06.343 --> 44:08.846
- Ahhhhhh!
- Please!

44:12.249 --> 44:14.685
I can't breathe.

44:14.785 --> 44:16.520
I need some air.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.626
You watch her.
I-I gotta get some air.

44:22.726 --> 44:23.861
Okay.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.141
Okay, lady.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.710
Y-You stay here.

45:22.352 --> 45:25.622
Casey, what are you doin'?

45:25.723 --> 45:28.159
Casey.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.827
Casey, what are you doin'?

45:29.927 --> 45:33.131
Nothing, nothing, baby.

45:33.230 --> 45:35.632
Nothing. What's wrong?

45:35.733 --> 45:39.204
Casey, listen...

45:39.303 --> 45:40.604
I just needed some air.

45:40.704 --> 45:42.439
Casey, I know you don't want
to do it,

45:42.539 --> 45:44.374
and you don't have to.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.345
Belle, I don't know
what else to do.

45:51.216 --> 45:54.052
But you know I'm doing this
for us, right?

45:54.152 --> 45:55.853
You know that, right?

46:00.125 --> 46:02.259
I ain't no murderer.

46:02.359 --> 46:04.661
I'm just tryin'
to give us a better life.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.999
And we're this close.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.367
You get that, right?

46:10.467 --> 46:12.302
Tell me you understand that.

46:12.402 --> 46:16.007
I need you to understand.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.107
Okay?

46:17.175 --> 46:19.010
I do.

46:20.344 --> 46:22.346
I love you so much.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.851
But I gotta do this.

46:35.193 --> 46:37.728
God, you're pretty.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.034
I can't lose you.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.605
You hear that?

46:48.705 --> 46:49.807
What?

46:49.907 --> 46:52.143
Here. Close your eyes.

46:52.243 --> 46:54.378
Close 'em. Come on.

46:54.478 --> 46:57.915
Just do it.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.218
You hear that sound?

47:00.317 --> 47:05.056
The waves crashing on the beach.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.757
Hmm?

47:06.857 --> 47:10.128
I want you to picture it
down there.

47:10.228 --> 47:13.164
Salt in the air.

47:13.264 --> 47:17.467
Sun shinin' on your face.

47:20.038 --> 47:22.773
Toes in the sand.

47:22.873 --> 47:24.741
No more shoes.

47:28.179 --> 47:31.182
Margaritas and sunsets.

47:31.282 --> 47:33.218
Hmm?

47:33.318 --> 47:35.619
Margaritas and sunsets.

47:37.955 --> 47:40.291
I'd do anything for you.

47:40.390 --> 47:43.094
I hope you know that.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.330
I do.

47:45.429 --> 47:48.532
Okay.

47:48.632 --> 47:50.868
Then you know
what has to be done.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.878
All right. Why don't you go
check on her, okay?

48:00.978 --> 48:03.081
- Okay.
- I need...

48:03.181 --> 48:04.381
I need to psych myself up.

48:04.481 --> 48:07.151
Probably best
if I do that a little.

48:07.252 --> 48:08.719
- You okay?
- Yeah.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.496
- Are you comin' back?
- Yeah, I'm comin' back, baby.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.689
I'll just be a minute, okay?

48:26.304 --> 48:28.239
Hey, lady, what are you doin'?!

48:28.339 --> 48:31.942
You're gonna get us in trouble.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.645
I won't. I promise.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.048
I ain't know how to make him
stop, okay?

48:37.148 --> 48:39.516
I ain't know how.

48:39.616 --> 48:41.219
Listen to me.

48:41.319 --> 48:42.653
You're a nice girl.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.422
Y-You don't want to
go to prison over this.

48:45.522 --> 48:47.025
You're too young.
You're too pretty.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.259
Shut up, lady!

48:48.359 --> 48:50.261
You ain't know me!

48:50.361 --> 48:51.795
We ain't goin' to prison, 'kay?

48:51.895 --> 48:54.299
We... We're gonna go to Mexico.

48:54.399 --> 48:57.634
With what money?

48:57.734 --> 48:59.670
The jewelry isn't real.

49:02.006 --> 49:03.540
What do you mean?

49:03.640 --> 49:07.412
My mother would never spend
money on... on real jewelry.

49:07.511 --> 49:08.979
It's fake. You're lyin'.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.948
I'm not.

49:11.049 --> 49:12.317
Look at it.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.585
It's costume jewelry.

49:15.686 --> 49:18.089
You can tell, can't you?
Look at it.

49:19.856 --> 49:22.659
You really want to go to prison
over costume jewelry?

49:27.698 --> 49:29.599
How do I trust you?

49:29.700 --> 49:32.136
Do you really want to ruin
your life over this?

49:33.737 --> 49:38.142
Look, you're...
you're a nice girl.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.011
You don't want to do this.

49:40.111 --> 49:42.246
You don't want to
throw your life away.

49:42.347 --> 49:45.083
Trust me.

49:45.183 --> 49:47.051
You have a family, don't you?

49:47.151 --> 49:48.952
A mom, a dad?

49:49.053 --> 49:53.991
Think about it.
Think about them, huh?

49:54.092 --> 49:55.426
Your baby...

49:55.525 --> 49:59.297
you have a baby on the way.

49:59.397 --> 50:01.432
You can't do this to your baby.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.919
Yeah! Ah!

50:23.021 --> 50:24.521
Yeah!

50:24.621 --> 50:26.257
You got this.

50:28.426 --> 50:31.062
You got this. You got this.

50:32.397 --> 50:35.199
Come on. Come on. Come on!

50:35.299 --> 50:37.468
Yeah! Ah.

50:46.643 --> 50:48.146
Where is she?

50:48.246 --> 50:49.646
I-I'm sorry.

50:49.746 --> 50:52.983
Where the hell is she,
Belle, huh?

50:53.084 --> 50:54.519
She said it's fake.

50:54.618 --> 50:56.487
What's fake?

50:56.586 --> 50:58.289
The jewelry.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.824
Fake?

51:00.924 --> 51:02.160
What?!

51:02.260 --> 51:04.861
You think anything in
that mansion looks fake, huh?

51:04.961 --> 51:06.997
No. It's real. It's very real.

51:07.098 --> 51:08.466
Look at that... shimmery, shiny.

51:08.565 --> 51:09.866
Look at that.

51:09.966 --> 51:11.835
She said just for costume.

51:11.935 --> 51:13.104
Costume?!

51:14.738 --> 51:16.474
Stop laughin' at me!

51:19.110 --> 51:21.578
- Why are you laughin' at me?
- What?!

51:21.678 --> 51:23.118
- Stop laughin' at me!
- Don't you...

51:23.214 --> 51:24.924
She's a witness, Belle.
You can't let her get away.

51:24.948 --> 51:26.417
God!

51:30.787 --> 51:33.157
- No!
- What?

51:44.302 --> 51:47.838
You don't... you're so stupid.

51:49.739 --> 51:51.775
If I'm so stupid,

51:51.875 --> 51:54.711
then why you gonna
marry me, huh?

51:58.249 --> 51:59.584
I don't want it. No, no.

51:59.683 --> 52:01.028
- I don't want it!
- Belle, Belle, Belle.

52:01.052 --> 52:02.529
- I don't want it!
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52:02.553 --> 52:03.796
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

52:03.820 --> 52:05.165
No, no. I shouldn't have
said that, okay?

52:05.189 --> 52:06.357
All right? I'm sorry.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.593
I apologize, okay?

52:08.692 --> 52:10.961
We all make mistakes, okay?
I'm sorry.

52:11.062 --> 52:14.332
I shouldn't have
reacted that way, all right?

52:14.432 --> 52:15.799
Now, we gotta find her.

52:15.899 --> 52:17.868
She's a witness, okay?

52:17.968 --> 52:19.408
She could get us
in a lot of trouble.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.239
We could go to prison, okay?

52:21.339 --> 52:22.540
- Okay.
- All right?

52:22.639 --> 52:24.308
So l-let's get
some of these jewels.

52:24.408 --> 52:26.710
Come on. Come on.

52:26.810 --> 52:30.747
We have to find her, Belle.
Come on.

52:30.847 --> 52:33.384
All right. Hurry.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.087
All right.
Now we gotta find her.

52:36.187 --> 52:38.055
Come on.

52:38.156 --> 52:39.490
Let's go!

52:56.374 --> 52:57.941
Come on.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.754
Shit!

53:10.854 --> 53:13.090
Shit. We lost her!

53:13.191 --> 53:14.858
I knew we shouldn't
have done this.

53:14.958 --> 53:17.261
<i>Why</i> did you have to let her go?

53:20.697 --> 53:22.567
What was I thinking?

53:22.667 --> 53:24.868
We're gonna have a baby, hmm?

53:24.968 --> 53:28.972
Belle, I screwed up, okay?

53:29.073 --> 53:31.609
I didn't mean to kill that man,
but I did, okay?

53:31.708 --> 53:33.544
But we have to do this <i>now.</i>

53:33.644 --> 53:35.046
You gotta pull it together.

53:48.825 --> 53:50.027
How we gonna find her?

53:50.127 --> 53:52.163
We just gotta think
like her, okay?

53:52.263 --> 53:53.773
She'd try and cut through
the woods, right,

53:53.797 --> 53:55.566
to get to a main road.

54:02.173 --> 54:03.873
Aaaah!

54:15.453 --> 54:17.622
Belle, there!

54:17.722 --> 54:20.458
There she is. Come on.

54:49.687 --> 54:52.323
Help!

54:52.423 --> 54:54.091
Help!

54:59.397 --> 55:00.765
Help!

55:10.708 --> 55:12.310
Help!

55:22.186 --> 55:24.021
Help!

55:24.121 --> 55:25.690
Help!

55:25.790 --> 55:27.491
Come on.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.104
- I heard something.
- Yeah, where?

55:31.128 --> 55:32.763
- Just that way.
- This way?

55:44.375 --> 55:46.243
There she is!

56:04.128 --> 56:06.397
I think she went in.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.105
She's gotta be in here.

56:14.205 --> 56:17.842
- How do you know?
- Where else would she go?

56:17.941 --> 56:19.577
Now, you take this. Okay.

56:19.677 --> 56:20.977
When she comes out...

56:21.078 --> 56:23.013
When she comes out,
you whack her.

56:23.114 --> 56:24.615
- I whack her?
- Yeah.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.350
- Okay.
- You can do that.

56:26.450 --> 56:27.718
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

56:27.818 --> 56:29.754
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

56:29.854 --> 56:31.188
Look, I'm sorry.

56:31.288 --> 56:33.691
I'm sorry for what
I said earlier, all right?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.925
I'm sorry for yelling at you,
okay?

56:36.026 --> 56:37.294
I love you.

56:37.395 --> 56:38.829
I do mean it.

56:38.928 --> 56:40.297
Okay.

56:41.799 --> 56:43.634
Okay.

57:04.722 --> 57:06.956
Ah.

57:07.057 --> 57:09.493
I gotta hand it to you.

57:09.593 --> 57:12.630
You rich girls run fast.

57:12.730 --> 57:14.732
Now, where the hell did you go?

57:19.637 --> 57:20.838
Aha!

57:20.937 --> 57:23.107
- Get out of there.
- Ow! Ow!

57:33.918 --> 57:35.619
Come on.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.692
No! Ah! Aah!

57:42.992 --> 57:44.061
Casey?

57:51.735 --> 57:53.437
Ah!

58:02.613 --> 58:05.683
Casey, you okay?

58:05.783 --> 58:08.118
What was that?

58:08.219 --> 58:10.554
You want me to come in?

58:23.367 --> 58:25.469
Aaaah!

58:35.846 --> 58:38.115
Casey?

58:41.352 --> 58:42.953
Casey?

58:48.592 --> 58:50.361
Casey! Oh, my God!

58:50.461 --> 58:52.997
Casey! Casey, wake up.
Please wak...

58:53.097 --> 58:55.299
Oh, my God.

59:01.071 --> 59:03.841
What happened?

59:03.941 --> 59:05.576
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.114
No, I think you need to see
a doctor for sure, Casey.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.316
- Where the hell is she?!
- I don't know.

59:12.416 --> 59:14.852
- Give me that.
- Casey.

59:14.952 --> 59:16.287
Hold on. Just wait one...

59:16.387 --> 59:17.831
No, we gotta find her,
and we're gonna nail her.

59:17.855 --> 59:19.590
Casey?

59:23.994 --> 59:26.697
Where is she?

59:26.797 --> 59:28.666
Here, you're bleedin' real bad.

59:30.801 --> 59:31.801
There she is!

59:31.835 --> 59:33.704
Oh, God.

59:33.804 --> 59:35.506
Come on.

59:39.243 --> 59:41.046
Come on, Belle, pick it up.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.197
Come on.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.049
I hear her.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.417
- Where?
- She's coming from that way.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.786
Well, let's go. Come on!

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.595
Aah!

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.064
Come on.

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:20.811
Oh, and I see her.
I'm gonna get that bitch.

01:01:27.018 --> 01:01:30.220
Ah, aah! Aah!

01:01:33.158 --> 01:01:35.626
Ah! Ah.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:41.699
Come on.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.967
Ah.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.025
Shh!

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:17.061
You hear that?

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:27.071
Come on, baby.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.410
Oh!

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.879
Aah!

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:05.375
Shh, shh!

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.517
Shh, shh!

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.220
She can't have gone far.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.421
That bitch is wearing slippers.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.456
Come on, let's go.

01:04:22.293 --> 01:04:24.329
Come on, baby. Come here.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:35.772
Sure she's gotta be around here.

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:37.975
- Casey, I...
- I know I heard her scream.

01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:39.977
I'm gonna kill her.

01:04:40.078 --> 01:04:41.654
I don't like this one bit.
Let's just go home.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.314
No, Belle, just shut up, okay?

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:44.848
Don't talk to me like that!

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.384
This on you, Belle, you.
All right?

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.120
We could've been
out of the state by now

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.988
if <i>you</i> hadn't of let her go.

01:04:51.089 --> 01:04:52.522
Hey.

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.126
Now, come on,
keep your eyes peeled.

01:04:55.226 --> 01:04:56.660
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:05:17.115 --> 01:05:20.517
I'm just gonna kill her
as soon as I see her.

01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:27.557
I'm gonna kill that bitch
just like I killed her husband!

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.831
Where are you?!

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:39.003
As soon as I see her,
like I did her stupid husband!

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.106
You hear that?! Huh?!

01:05:43.207 --> 01:05:45.509
I think I heard something.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.146
Come on. Come on.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.676
She got a head start,
but she can't have gone far.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:24.548
Oh.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.151
I should've killed her
when I had the chance.

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:28.419
Casey!

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:30.520
Like I killed
her stupid husband.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.157
You're scarin' me. Who are you?!

01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:35.193
You know who I am, huh?

01:06:35.293 --> 01:06:37.828
Huh? You wanna know who I am?

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:40.797
I'm the...
I'm the man who's gonna

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:44.435
do everything it takes
to save woman I love.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:47.338
Help me flush her out, okay?
Okay.

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:48.581
Okay, you understand that,
right?

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:49.706
- Yeah.
- Do you?

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.486
- Mm-hmm.
- Then tell me you love me, okay?

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.478
- Okay.
- Tell me you love me.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.512
I love you.

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.183
- Good.
- Now let's finish this.

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:00.984
Come on.

01:07:03.054 --> 01:07:05.056
Come on, Belle.

01:07:05.156 --> 01:07:06.190
She's gettin' away.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.270
Juliette?

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.934
Oh, man.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:08.386
Hi. I need a sheriff
at Old Highway 55,

01:08:08.486 --> 01:08:10.555
Dixon Estate.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:12.256
Hurry.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:15.193
Juliette.

01:08:48.593 --> 01:08:51.529
Oh, man.

01:08:58.469 --> 01:09:00.337
Juliette?

01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:18.755
Ah!

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.291
Where are you?!

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.027
- Casey, the sunrise.
- Shh!

01:09:26.397 --> 01:09:28.399
Where are you?!

01:09:28.499 --> 01:09:29.634
Ahhh!

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:31.169
God damn it!

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:33.104
What about your daddy?

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:34.272
No witnesses.

01:09:34.372 --> 01:09:35.372
What?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.874
No witnesses.

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.843
You mean you'd kill
your own daddy?!

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.279
Hey! Hey!

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:47.984
I'm sorry. Come on.

01:09:48.085 --> 01:09:50.220
Come on.

01:09:50.321 --> 01:09:52.089
Come on.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.927
Juliette?

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.468
Ah!

01:11:36.294 --> 01:11:38.962
Juliette!

01:11:39.664 --> 01:11:41.732
Look, Belle, there's a cabin.

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:43.734
Come on, let's check it out.

01:11:51.075 --> 01:11:52.076
I'm gettin' tired.

01:11:52.176 --> 01:11:54.211
It's okay, baby. Keep going.

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.550
Oh, shit!

01:12:45.596 --> 01:12:47.398
Come on.

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:16.193
Juliette!

01:13:26.804 --> 01:13:30.040
I know you made a mistake!

01:13:30.141 --> 01:13:32.443
I know you have a drug problem.

01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:38.582
Shh, shh, shh.

01:13:48.659 --> 01:13:50.861
I know you're in the shed!

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.331
Your dad is probably
at the estate by now.

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.446
Juliette!

01:14:25.062 --> 01:14:27.565
Juliette!

01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:31.469
Juliette!

01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.839
Juliette!

01:14:34.939 --> 01:14:37.775
Casey, you hear that?

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:39.143
That's your dad.

01:14:39.243 --> 01:14:41.812
- Shit. He's gonna find us.
- It's your daddy.

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:43.647
It's your daddy.

01:14:47.418 --> 01:14:49.986
Here's what we gotta do.
All right?

01:14:50.087 --> 01:14:52.156
You gotta go out there,
hands up,

01:14:52.256 --> 01:14:53.557
and you got to say, "Sorry."

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.101
Sorry. We ain't gonna
hurt you no more."

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.536
- She gonna shoot me!
- No, she ain't.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.871
She's not a killer.
How do you know?

01:14:57.895 --> 01:14:59.396
No, no, I know.

01:14:59.497 --> 01:15:01.241
I just know, okay?
She's not the murdering type.

01:15:01.265 --> 01:15:03.367
Well, neither were you.

01:15:03.467 --> 01:15:05.269
Shh! All right?

01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:13.477
Just go out there, hands up,

01:15:13.577 --> 01:15:15.246
and say we ain't gonna
hurt her no more.

01:15:15.346 --> 01:15:17.481
Why won't you go? I'm pregnant.

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:20.217
It don't matter! Okay?

01:15:20.317 --> 01:15:22.553
It's gonna be prison or Mexico.

01:15:22.653 --> 01:15:24.822
No witnesses!

01:15:39.236 --> 01:15:43.140
No witnesses, okay?

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.109
On the count of three.

01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:48.013
One... yeah, yeah... two...

01:15:59.557 --> 01:16:00.858
Three, go!

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:03.160
- Don't shoot me!
- Stay back.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.361
Where's Casey?

01:16:04.461 --> 01:16:06.630
He's not here. He left me.

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.265
I don't believe you.

01:16:08.365 --> 01:16:09.900
Where's Casey? II-I don't know.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.336
He... He left 'cause, ah,
really,

01:16:12.436 --> 01:16:16.073
he real mad at me for le...
not killing you.

01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:17.641
Stay back.

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:18.909
I'm scared.

01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:21.779
<i>You're</i> scared? You're scared?

01:16:24.315 --> 01:16:27.718
We didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

01:16:27.818 --> 01:16:29.587
Where's Casey?

01:16:35.826 --> 01:16:37.861
Aah!

01:16:41.465 --> 01:16:44.201
No, no, no!

01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:47.072
- I'm sorry.
- Casey!

01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:48.648
I don't want to do this.
I really don't.

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:51.175
- Casey, stop!
- You don't have to do this. No.

01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:54.012
- Casey.
- No, no, no, no.

01:16:54.111 --> 01:16:55.279
I'm sorry. I don't want to.

01:16:55.379 --> 01:16:56.947
- Casey!
- No witnesses!

01:16:57.048 --> 01:16:59.149
- Casey, no!
- No, no, no, no.

01:16:59.249 --> 01:17:00.851
- No witnesses!
- Casey, stop!

01:17:00.951 --> 01:17:02.553
I'm so sorry.

01:17:02.653 --> 01:17:05.189
I'm sorry.
I don't want to do this.

01:17:05.289 --> 01:17:06.790
- No, no, no.
- Casey!

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:09.326
No!

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.827
Oh, my...

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:15.726
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.537
I'm sorry.
You didn't have to kill her.

01:18:26.637 --> 01:18:28.405
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

01:18:28.505 --> 01:18:29.907
You didn't have to kill her!

01:18:30.008 --> 01:18:33.243
- I'm sorry, Belle.
- You didn't have to kill her.

01:18:33.343 --> 01:18:34.545
You didn't have to do it.

01:18:34.645 --> 01:18:35.979
I did, Belle.

01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:38.321
You didn't have to kill her.
You didn't have to kill her!

01:18:51.528 --> 01:18:55.066
I did it for you...

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:57.035
Belle.

01:19:05.275 --> 01:19:07.212
Oh.

01:19:17.287 --> 01:19:19.823
Why you had to do...

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:23.094
Why you had to do it?

01:19:23.194 --> 01:19:25.896
Why you had to do it, huh?

01:19:51.288 --> 01:19:54.925
Oh, mama.

01:20:04.269 --> 01:20:07.371
Ah... I...

01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:09.506
I-I'm gonna have a baby.

01:20:09.606 --> 01:20:12.409
He... He went c-crazy.

01:20:12.509 --> 01:20:14.511
H-He killed husband.
He killed the lady.

01:20:14.611 --> 01:20:18.116
He killed the lady.

01:20:18.216 --> 01:20:19.950
I loved him.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:27.158
I-I love him.

01:20:35.099 --> 01:20:36.834
I didn't...

01:20:39.503 --> 01:20:41.772
I'll clean this up,
buy you some time.

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:48.879
You get as far away from here
as you can possibly go

01:20:48.979 --> 01:20:51.015
and never look back.

01:20:51.115 --> 01:20:53.383
You understand me?

01:20:53.483 --> 01:20:56.820
You understand me?

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.723
Go.

01:20:59.823 --> 01:21:01.192
Go!

01:21:06.297 --> 01:21:08.233
One more thing.

01:21:16.673 --> 01:21:18.809
You take care of my grandkid.

01:21:21.812 --> 01:21:25.883
You give him a fighting chance
to have a good life, all right?

01:21:28.319 --> 01:21:30.721
'Cause you're all the family
I've got.

01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:39.130
Ain't nothin' as important
as family.

01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:40.998
Nothin'.

01:21:56.014 --> 01:21:58.082
No witnesses.

01:21:58.182 --> 01:22:01.119
What?
