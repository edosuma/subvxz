Tyce right now.

with the dildo.

I might need to
work up to that one.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.782
Oh, my God. Why can't guys
just get over their hangups

12:19.913 --> 12:21.044
and give pegging a try?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.263
Seriously, if they knew

12:22.393 --> 12:23.612
what it was
like to get fucked,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.570
they'd probably be
better at fucking.

Hey, is it cool
if we, like...

12:28.530 --> 12:32.664

about, you know, this?

Please.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.325
Why?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.458
Well, because what we do in bed
is no one else's business.

I don't even want you
telling Ulysses about it.

OK, I didn't tell
him everything.

the waterboarding supplies.

get the 600?

Can't you ever just
keep your mouth shut?

13:12.792 --> 13:13.967
The only reason
that you care

13:14.097 --> 13:16.056
is because, for some
dumbass reason,

13:16.186 --> 13:19.711

being a sub is emasculating.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.279
Um, hello? Have you been
out in the world lately?

13:22.410 --> 13:24.455

We've done this
before with a woman,

22:33.090 --> 22:35.223
and there were no
objections because women

22:35.354 --> 22:38.139
are accustomed to
being sexualized.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.707
So, yes, I believe that men

22:40.837 --> 22:43.623
should experience what it's
like to be objectified as well.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.276
TYCE:
Are you seriously
saying that?

22:45.407 --> 22:47.191
To a black guy?

22:47.322 --> 22:48.845
That's hashtag problematic,
don't you think?

22:51.065 --> 22:52.283
JETHRO:
Now where are you going?

22:53.328 --> 22:54.285
CARLY:
Home.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.505
I'm tired.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.115
I still haven't
come yet.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.553
Guess that's your
problem, isn't it?

23:00.683 --> 23:01.989
Why are you acting
all pissed?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.207
I'm the one who
should be mad.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.384
You just criticized
my craft!

23:05.514 --> 23:08.604
-[ scoffs ]
-Whatever, Jethro.

23:08.735 --> 23:09.736
I'm going to the car.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.957
Well, hold on.
Still have to get changed.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.176
I'll wait outside.

Uh, hey. Wait up.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.355
Um...

23:20.486 --> 23:22.575
I'm just really
sorry about this, man.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.838
We're not
usually this crazy...

23:24.968 --> 23:27.449
-I don't think...-It's all right.
No hard feelings.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.886
I just hope you two
get this sorted out.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.671
Thanks.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.412
Oh, and I gotta say,

23:33.542 --> 23:35.196
it felt awkward
bringing it up earlier,

23:35.326 --> 23:36.502
but, um, I'm a big fan.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.722
Of your underwear ads.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.507
I've been seeing
them everywhere.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.943

boyfriend, we love 'em!

Hey.

Oh...

24:32.427 --> 24:34.560
Oh...

24:34.690 --> 24:37.084
I so don't wanna go
to work this morning.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.872
How'd you sleep?

24:43.003 --> 24:45.266
Like a baby. Just not long
enough. How about you?

24:47.355 --> 24:49.226
Uh, yeah,
it was on and off.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.535
I was, uh, sort of...

24:53.666 --> 24:55.581
too excited to sleep.

24:55.711 --> 24:56.712
You're cute.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.149
OK, hold on.

I'm gonna brush my teeth.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.026

25:06.156 --> 25:08.985
Yeah, I have this--this weird
thing about morning breath.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.988

unless I brush my teeth.

But I'm not mad.

You know, just because last
night didn't go so well

26:31.328 --> 26:34.636

want us to keep trying

spend the whole day
in bed with you,

making it any easier.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.005
Do you always work
on Saturdays?

26:56.136 --> 26:59.226
No, thank God. It's just
been really busy.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.794
It's weird. There's been
this, like, sudden epidemic

exhibiting signs of
delusional schizophrenia.
