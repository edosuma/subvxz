00:01.610 --> 00:03.394
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.438 --> 00:05.135
This is what
our Triad is meant to do.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.397
Why are you smiling?

00:06.441 --> 00:07.833
<i>Because this will bring about</i>

00:07.877 --> 00:09.226
the alighting.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.228
Just as Ophiuchus has
a plan for you, Max,

00:11.272 --> 00:12.186
it has one for her.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.367
Help! Help me!

00:23.719 --> 00:26.026
Focus on that Bible,
and I'll do the rest.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.984
<i>These glasses are the key</i> <i>
to decoding my dad's Bible.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.899
This Bible will have
your instructions.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.509
Once you get those glasses,
you'll be able to

00:31.553 --> 00:33.424
know everything you
want about your father.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.774
<i>When the time comes,</i> <i>
you'll find your way to it.</i>

00:35.818 --> 00:37.515
<i>The key to reading it will be</i> <i>
in a secret spot</i>

00:37.559 --> 00:39.430
<i>that only you will know.</i>

00:39.474 --> 00:41.998
Toss the glasses and the Bible
over to me, or she goes in.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.655
<i>This isn't over.</i><i>For you and the rest</i>

00:46.698 --> 00:49.353
<i>of your disruptive friends,</i> <i>
I think it is.</i>

Come on, Alex.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.998
You've got my attention,

02:09.041 --> 02:11.000
so show me something.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.748
What are you doing?

02:19.791 --> 02:23.186
I have been trying all night to
get another message from Alex.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.057
I thought
maybe a séance

02:25.101 --> 02:27.103
would help me connect
with his spirit,

02:27.147 --> 02:30.150
but so far... Teen Witch fire hazard
isn't working?

02:30.193 --> 02:32.543
I know that this isn't your
thing, but you read Kyle's text.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.459
Alex has had zero contact
with Deep Sky,

02:35.503 --> 02:37.635
and I'm just...
starting to get worried

02:37.679 --> 02:39.289
that he... Hey.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.899
Alex is not dead.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.423
There has to be
a scientific explanation

02:42.466 --> 02:44.642
for how Alex
is reaching out to you.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.861
Right.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.211
You have a working theory?

02:48.255 --> 02:51.171
At first, I thought this was
a resurgence of your powers,

02:51.214 --> 02:53.260
like a vision of Alex
manifesting itself.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.826
But your brain scans match up

02:54.870 --> 02:56.306
with your last checkup,
post-cure,

02:56.350 --> 02:59.048
which means
this is not a vision.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.745
Alex is alive.

03:00.789 --> 03:03.226
And he's figuring out a way
to communicate with you.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.054
We've seen versions
of this before.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.577
You did it in the coma.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.318
Max talked to Rosa
in the pod.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.364
So you think Alex
is trapped somewhere,

03:10.407 --> 03:12.017
and he's reaching out for help?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.236
I think we got to switch séance

03:13.280 --> 03:15.020
[door opens]for science.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.414
Surprise, witches!

03:17.458 --> 03:20.330
Bet you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.071
I would have been here sooner,

03:22.114 --> 03:25.117
but Papi busted out
the welcome-home pancakes.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.423
Why are you back?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.425
I called
for some reinforcements.

03:28.469 --> 03:31.036
Rosa has been honing
her echolocation power.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.300
And now seemed like
the perfect time to test it.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.779
So...

03:34.823 --> 03:36.564
you used to talk to me
when I was dead.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.609
The least I can do
is hop on a red-eye

03:38.653 --> 03:40.089
to prove that Alex isn't.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.963
Oh, well, Iz, whatever you
were searching for out here,

03:45.007 --> 03:47.488
I'd say we're one barn fire
too late.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.012
When I was helping Dallas
unlock his memories from '47,

03:50.055 --> 03:52.493
we ended up in this spot
in a mindscape.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.669
Michael, I had a memory
of fighting Tezca

03:54.712 --> 03:56.366
as a little girl.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.326
You thought placing yourself
at the...

03:59.369 --> 04:01.197
trigger point would,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.634
- well, trigger you.
- When we were fighting, Tezca told me,

04:03.678 --> 04:06.463
"No matter where
in the universe you are...

04:06.507 --> 04:09.292
my blade will find you."

04:09.336 --> 04:12.295
'Cause that's
- not unsettling at all.
- I mean,

04:12.339 --> 04:13.992
what's unsettling is,
it wasn't even a threat.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.516
It's not like she was trying
to goad me into a fight.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.604
I was seeking

04:16.647 --> 04:18.040
her approval.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.955
Maybe not remembering
is for the best.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.522
What good has ever come from us
poking into our childhood?

04:21.565 --> 04:24.481
If there is a connection
between me and Tezca,

04:24.525 --> 04:26.135
maybe we can figure out
where Dallas is.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.615
Just be careful.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.965
In my experience dealing
with the Dark Triad,

04:30.008 --> 04:33.316
it's the thing
that draws you in...

04:33.360 --> 04:35.710
that ends up hurting you
the most.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.585
Hey.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.893
Can I get you a coffee

04:44.936 --> 04:46.460
or whip up some... Uh, I got
to change

04:46.503 --> 04:48.984
before I head to the lab.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.726
Um, can we talk for a second?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.380
I was worried about you.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.729
About us.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.252
It's never a good sign

04:56.296 --> 04:58.210
when Liz Ortecho crosses
state lines.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.690
I wasn't running away.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.213
I just...

05:01.257 --> 05:03.303
I needed some time
to clear my head.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.917
Did you find
what you were looking for?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.571
Hitched a ride

05:10.614 --> 05:12.747
with Shivani on
her private plane to New York,

05:12.790 --> 05:14.401
where Rosa put
into perspective

05:14.444 --> 05:16.577
my recent penchant for
alien-themed gastronomy

05:16.620 --> 05:18.448
and blue book
pop quizzes.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.929
Turns out, in
leaning hard away

05:20.972 --> 05:24.062
from the science,
I was denying my authentic self.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.760
Shivani and I,
we've got

05:25.803 --> 05:28.284
a promising theory on how
to disable Bonnie's virus.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.633
Oh.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.462
Well, uh,
just be careful out there.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
We have a bit
of a situation.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.987
I mean, Tezca's
behind alien bars,

05:36.031 --> 05:37.598
but Clyde's in the wind,
and no one

05:37.641 --> 05:39.513
has heard from Dallas or Bonnie
since yesterday.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.384
What?
No, no, no,
we'll find them.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.038
Michael and I are meeting up
to search right now.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.910
Alex is missing, too.
And now,

05:45.954 --> 05:48.783
like some alien medium, Maria's
been getting messages from him.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.132
Well, I got to tell Michael...

05:50.175 --> 05:51.525
No, wait, wait, uh...

05:51.568 --> 05:53.875
Mikey runs hot.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.964
News like this,
that's gonna tear him apart.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.140
Especially when we have
no information.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.577
I think we should give Maria
some time to figure this out.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.275
You really think secrecy is
the best plan?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.407
I don't know, I just...

06:04.451 --> 06:06.191
I'm close to a cure for Michael,

06:06.235 --> 06:07.845
and that'll help even the odds
against these aliens,

06:07.889 --> 06:09.586
who probably know
where our friends are.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.414
Which is why I think
you should take my cure

06:11.458 --> 06:13.373
and get your powers back.
And considering

06:13.416 --> 06:15.592
we are woefully low
on aliens to fight aliens,

06:15.636 --> 06:17.638
I... I think that would help us.

06:17.681 --> 06:21.076
Why can't you just accept that I
am perfectly capable of helping

06:21.119 --> 06:22.860
without abilities?'Cause that is a huge gamble.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.122
And it's selfish.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.210
Not only are you

06:25.254 --> 06:26.995
denying your powers,

06:27.038 --> 06:28.910
but you're also denying
- who you are.
- Well, look,

06:28.953 --> 06:30.912
I'm glad you found your path,

06:30.955 --> 06:34.219
and I support you on that.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.439
But this is how I go about mine.

06:39.094 --> 06:42.010
Well, then we're
right where we were yesterday.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.151
Wait, remind what we're doing

06:53.195 --> 06:55.023
trespassing
on government property.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.417
We're so far out, even God
forgot this place exists.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.331
I got a call

06:59.375 --> 07:01.116
to tow an abandoned junker
that matches Dallas's wheels.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.726
Figured it was worth pursuing.

07:02.770 --> 07:03.901
Good call.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.774
You heard from Maria lately?

07:06.817 --> 07:08.297
I keep calling
her to see

07:08.340 --> 07:09.298
if her chess partner
checked in, but...

07:09.341 --> 07:10.517
Yeah, she's fine.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.476
Um, Liz saw her last night.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.738
What's with the vibe?

07:14.782 --> 07:16.218
I don't have a vibe.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.480
I don't need
my alien mojo to know

07:17.524 --> 07:18.525
when something's wrong with you.

07:19.917 --> 07:23.443
Oh. You're in your feels
'cause we're Muggles now.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.751
Well, actually, uh,
Liz is working on that.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.579
She thinks she can bring
your powers back.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.015
You passing on it?

07:31.059 --> 07:33.148
Uh... yeah, I mean,
I think it's best

07:33.191 --> 07:35.585
if I keep the blue flame
locked up.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.326
That's what you want?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.894
What I want is to be
a normal guy from Roswell.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.983
This might be my shot.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.941
I just wish
I could make Liz understand

07:43.985 --> 07:45.639
that I'm doing it for us.

07:45.682 --> 07:46.988
Hmm.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.120
Hey. There's a car
over there.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.170
The plates match.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.606
It's Dallas's.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.955
Doesn't take
cop instincts

07:57.999 --> 08:00.349
to figure out
this is Clyde's doing.

08:03.570 --> 08:07.748
If Clyde did find him, I
bet he's got Theo's Bible.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.580
Things just went
from bad to worse.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.934
<i>!¡Maldita sea!</i>

08:19.977 --> 08:21.805
<i>Que demonios.</i> Okay.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.372
Of the little
Spanish I know,

08:23.415 --> 08:25.026
none of those words
sound celebratory.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.854
The regenerative enzymes
in the blood sample

08:26.897 --> 08:29.117
we brought back
from New York... Mm-hmm.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.119
isn't healing the diseased cells
in our subject.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.208
What about using the
biosynthetic compound

08:33.251 --> 08:34.775
that my team developed?

08:34.818 --> 08:36.341
The fluid stimulates
the proteins momentarily,

08:36.385 --> 08:37.691
but it isn't potent enough

08:37.734 --> 08:39.562
to sustain
their viability.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.869
Maybe there's just
no solution to this.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.959
Okay, I like to think
of a setback as an opportunity

08:45.002 --> 08:46.613
for ideas to blossom.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.702
It's not... working.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.879
Then be the one to make
the improbable possible.

08:51.922 --> 08:52.967
We are so close

08:53.010 --> 08:54.664
to a breakthrough.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.019
Liz, I haven't asked
for anything,

09:02.063 --> 09:04.369
and what I need right now
is your word.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.023
Can I trust you?

09:07.024 --> 09:08.809
Of course.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.817
You had a pod
this whole time?

09:16.860 --> 09:19.776
The vestiges of one.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.822
My team found it
in Careyes.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.824
The viscous liquid
we developed

09:23.867 --> 09:26.261
was formulated using
the fluid from within.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.915
It contains
restorative properties

09:27.958 --> 09:30.091
identical to the ones
that you've been researching.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.050
In gene-sequencing
your work,

09:33.094 --> 09:34.443
I found micromolecular inconsistencies,

09:34.486 --> 09:37.011
and this crack explains why.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.319
Oxygen is changing the fluid's
chemical composition.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.234
In order

09:43.278 --> 09:46.324
to continue testing, we need a
pod that's in working condition.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.370
You got one in a junk drawer?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.679
Now it's my turn
to share a secret.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.119
Found it.

10:09.217 --> 10:13.351
I can hear the frequency of
Alex's DNA in the hair, but...

10:13.395 --> 10:14.962
nowhere else.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.617
I-I'm just...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.707
I'm lost.
If you can't even hear him...

10:20.750 --> 10:23.623
Honestly,
maybe I'm not supposed to.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.276
I mean,
he's been reaching out to you.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.930
Maybe that's for a reason.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.410
Michael and Liz
got messages, too.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.759
When they were with you.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.109
I mean, Maria,
this could be a new power.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.329
- I don't know.
- We know that the Caulfield experiments

10:34.372 --> 10:35.939
warped
your family's alien ability.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.680
If Liz was able
to reverse the effects

10:37.724 --> 10:39.464
of your brain degeneration,
then it makes sense

10:39.508 --> 10:41.945
that you're going through
your own alien puberty.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.947
It's doubtful.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.167
Alex has been silent,

10:46.210 --> 10:47.908
even now that
I've been trying to listen.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.171
Maybe his messages
aren't coming through

10:50.214 --> 10:52.216
because you're not in the right
headspace to hear them.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.655
I know what that's like.
When we were trying to save you,

10:55.698 --> 10:58.483
it was all so overwhelming--
everything riding on me

10:58.527 --> 11:00.747
to just get it together.

11:00.790 --> 11:01.878
But I did.

11:02.923 --> 11:03.837
You can, too.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.403
How'd you do it?

11:05.447 --> 11:07.362
Isobel taught me

11:07.405 --> 11:09.364
that in order to silence
all the noise,

11:09.407 --> 11:11.366
you have to find a place
inside yourself

11:11.409 --> 11:13.760
where you feel safe and calm.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.892
What makes you feel
like you can silence

11:15.936 --> 11:19.635
everything
to hear the imperceptible?

11:20.636 --> 11:22.986
My mom.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.249
I got my strength from her.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.342
And when your mom felt lost,

11:31.386 --> 11:33.257
what did she do?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.172
Well, she would take

11:35.216 --> 11:38.480
long, barefoot walks
in the desert.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.177
All right.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.179
Looks like we're getting
our steps in.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.400
I've come for answers.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.535
My buddy Dallas
is missing,

11:50.579 --> 11:52.712
and I have a hunch that
your little partner in crime

11:52.755 --> 11:54.409
might have something
to do with it.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.541
Clyde's no partner of mine.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.674
Well, you still know his plans
for Dallas.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.590
So why don't you be
a good prisoner and, uh,

12:01.633 --> 12:04.767
- tell me Jones' plan, hmm?
- I'd rather take

12:04.811 --> 12:09.076
my last breath than ever give
my enemy a single answer.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.034
I used to think that
you were my enemy, too.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.166
But yesterday,

12:12.209 --> 12:14.037
fighting you triggered a memory.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.259
I trained with you as a child.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.217
But considering
the fact

12:20.261 --> 12:22.567
that my mother and Jones
despised each other,

12:22.611 --> 12:23.960
I have a hard time believing

12:24.004 --> 12:25.570
that she would willingly
allow me to learn

12:25.614 --> 12:27.181
from the devil's lieutenant.

12:27.877 --> 12:31.925
We've never crossed
paths on Oasis.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.799
Then why do I remember you
telling me...

12:36.843 --> 12:40.716
"No matter where
in the universe you are,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.110
my blade will find you."

12:45.982 --> 12:48.855
Don't get arrogant.
Anticipate my move.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.553
That's the spirit.

12:56.819 --> 13:00.257
You remember telling me
those words.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.433
I can see it in your eyes.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.914
So...

13:04.958 --> 13:06.742
looks like you and I have
the same question.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.833
Why?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.797
Ah, they're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.192
Are there two others
in addition to your subject?

13:22.236 --> 13:25.413
I'm bending my moral compass
to the point of breaking.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
The less you know,
the better for all involved.

13:40.515 --> 13:43.866
Watching you handle
that pod with care,

13:43.910 --> 13:48.175
there's a familiarity that goes
beyond scientific inquiry.

13:49.219 --> 13:52.266
Max Evans is an alien, isn't he?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.531
His secret is safe.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.663
I know what it's like
to hide something

13:58.707 --> 14:01.362
the world isn't ready
to understand.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.982
This is ridiculous.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.289
My feet hurt. I keep stepping
on these little pebbles.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.117
You know there's tarantulas
out here, right?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.945
I think Mimi was
really onto something.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.164
Energy rises from the ground
into your feet,

14:21.208 --> 14:23.645
and since consciousness is
a tangible form of energy

14:23.688 --> 14:27.170
connecting us to all matter,
astrophysicists believe that...

14:27.214 --> 14:30.739
meditation could open you up
to speaking over universes,

14:30.782 --> 14:32.436
even dimensions.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.656
Trying to figure out why
I'm an alien tuning fork

14:34.699 --> 14:37.050
led me to some very
unexpected people, but...

14:37.093 --> 14:40.096
Listen, just... relax.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.665
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.321
Focus on your surroundings.

14:47.364 --> 14:50.063
Let go of any of the
weight you may feel,

14:50.106 --> 14:52.500
the judgment.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.507
It's a locust.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.945
Alex was looking for these
before he went missing.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.381
Missing?

15:04.425 --> 15:06.253
What do you mean
Alex went missing?

15:14.957 --> 15:16.785
Why atomize
the fluid into a mist?

15:16.828 --> 15:18.134
I made slight genetic modifications

15:18.178 --> 15:19.440
to accelerate
enzyme inhibitors

15:19.483 --> 15:21.137
for swift cell regeneration.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.530
Molecules, they travel faster
in a gaseous state

15:22.573 --> 15:23.923
than in liquid form.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.142
If this cure eradicates
the alien virus,

15:26.186 --> 15:29.232
could it be repurposed
to fight off human illness?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.017
Like a universal vaccine?

15:31.060 --> 15:33.715
Interspecies scaling at
this level would be a huge leap.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.326
It's working.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.502
The proteins
are strengthening the cells.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.591
- You did it!
- Oh!

15:40.635 --> 15:41.897
Oh!

15:43.246 --> 15:45.205
Max will be thrilled.

15:45.248 --> 15:48.034
Max doesn't want the cure.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.515
Max has been struggling
with control,

15:51.559 --> 15:54.040
and this compound does more than
prevent the sniffles in aliens.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.652
- He's made his choice.
- Oh. And you disagree.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.741
I'm quite familiar
with being on opposite sides

15:59.784 --> 16:01.438
in a relationship.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.440
As you know,
my wife is relentless

16:03.484 --> 16:05.877
when she's made up her mind.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.054
Which doesn't exactly mesh
with my stubbornness.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.056
How do you find common ground

16:10.099 --> 16:12.275
when neither of you
wants to budge?

16:12.319 --> 16:14.538
Allie and I have difficulty
meeting in the middle

16:14.582 --> 16:16.453
about anything lately.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.803
If you find out,
will you let me know?

16:18.847 --> 16:20.457
Oh!

16:26.028 --> 16:28.770
So, a bug flies
on your arm,

16:28.813 --> 16:31.251
and you think that means
Alex is missing?

16:31.294 --> 16:34.254
- Feels like a stretch.
- It's not just the locust.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
You were there
with the poster.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.692
Alex is out chasing
weather balloons.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.650
If something was wrong,
Eduardo would have told us.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.523
Liz reached out to Eduardo.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.395
Deep Sky hasn't heard
from Alex, either.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.183
So everyone's
- on the group chat but me.
- I'm sorry.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.837
We didn't want to worry you.
We were planning on telling you

16:52.881 --> 16:54.491
when things were
less confusing.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.232
ROSA:And look, it's
not all bad news.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.886
We believe that Alex
is reaching out to Maria,

16:57.929 --> 16:59.322
the same way
that she reached out to me

16:59.366 --> 17:00.932
when Jones trapped her
in the coma.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.717
How is that not bad news?
You don't think if he

17:02.760 --> 17:04.762
was trying to talk to someone,
he'd be trying to talk to me?

17:04.806 --> 17:06.286
I mean, she might be

17:06.329 --> 17:07.809
the only one that's listening
right now.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.202
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

17:09.245 --> 17:10.725
You don't think
I was thinking of Alex

17:10.768 --> 17:12.379
every single second?

17:12.422 --> 17:13.902
I was risking my life to stop
whatever Milky Way mess

17:13.945 --> 17:15.425
the Dark Triad
set in motion.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.993
Oh, and you...
what have you done lately?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.691
Besides pretending
that you still have powers?!

17:23.781 --> 17:25.000
♪ There ain't no grave

17:25.044 --> 17:27.002
♪ Can hold my body down

17:28.003 --> 17:30.092
♪ No, there ain't no grave

17:30.136 --> 17:32.007
♪ Can hold my body down

17:32.051 --> 17:34.749
Hey. I'm glad you're here.
So it turns out

17:34.792 --> 17:36.098
the notes that Dallas was
scribbling were directions...

17:39.536 --> 17:41.234
♪ Ain't no grave

17:41.277 --> 17:42.583
♪ Can hold my body down

17:43.801 --> 17:45.020
Get off me!

17:45.064 --> 17:48.067
I will when
you calm down!

17:51.766 --> 17:54.551
How can you keep Alex missing
a secret from me?

17:54.595 --> 17:58.033
Because people thought that this
is exactly what would happen.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.600
I could have been looking
for him.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.603
How? We have no idea
what's going on.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.344
And even if we did,
we don't have powers.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.608
I walked through a wall
of fire... to save Liz

18:07.651 --> 18:09.044
from a literal dictator.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.828
And you want to make me
feel melodramatic?

18:10.872 --> 18:12.526
When you knew, you knew
that the man that I love...

18:12.569 --> 18:14.005
I did this because of Liz.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.182
We're not
in a good place.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.227
Okay? She had this whole thing
set up.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.969
I didn't want to betray her
again by undermining it.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.798
To win back the girl,
you stabbed me in the back.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.061
I never meant for you
to get hurt.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.063
Okay? You have to believe me.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.239
You have spent years

18:30.283 --> 18:33.068
insisting that we are family.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.983
If you believe that,

18:35.026 --> 18:37.638
then you wouldn't have used my
suffering to fix your love life.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.379
♪ There ain't no grave

18:39.422 --> 18:42.425
Hope the wedding's
worth losing a brother.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.341
♪ There ain't no grave

18:45.385 --> 18:47.909
♪ Can hold my body down.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.650
My savior warned us

18:49.693 --> 18:52.783
of rebels with the abilities
to deceive our emotions.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.437
I was born into Ophiuchus

18:54.481 --> 18:56.613
and molded
into its fiercest warrior.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.921
I have devoted my life to taking
a stand against its enemies.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.401
You don't have to believe me,

19:01.444 --> 19:03.359
but you should at least
believe yourself.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.578
I can help

19:04.621 --> 19:06.101
unlock your subconscious,

19:06.145 --> 19:08.016
- Tezca.
- And why would I do that?

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
Because a great warrior will get
all the intel she needs

19:13.195 --> 19:15.154
before she goes into battle.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.990
You're not afraid I'll run?

19:26.034 --> 19:28.428
I think you're more interested
in our shared history.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.563
I know there's got to be more.
Let me show you.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.739
You're turning into
quite the bold warrior.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.132
I want to be

19:37.176 --> 19:38.612
as strong as my mother someday.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.135
You know, your mother's gone

19:40.179 --> 19:43.007
precisely because she loves you
so much.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.968
She's fighting to protect you
and countless other families.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.318
Where's your family, Teacher?

19:50.711 --> 19:52.974
My students are my family.

19:53.017 --> 19:55.411
You're my family.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.500
We're bound by our blades.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.633
No matter where in
the universe you are,

19:59.676 --> 20:01.983
my blade will find you.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.421
You're going to be the
fiercest warrior somebody,

20:05.465 --> 20:09.164
but never forget: a warrior's
true strength is her compassion.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.774
That's what makes
you so special.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.168
Because I can see the truth?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
Just like my mother?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
It's a beautiful gift.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.524
One that evil people will try
to corrupt for their own means.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.309
That's why it's so important

20:23.352 --> 20:26.094
that we teach you
to protect yourself.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.576
Because you deserve a say
in your own story.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.887
You see? I told you.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.933
Our stories are connected.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.860
The lair's closed to liars.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.166
I deserve that.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.907
Can I make it up
to you?

20:56.951 --> 20:58.953
Get you your powers back?

21:03.087 --> 21:04.872
Sure this is gonna work?

21:04.915 --> 21:08.223
Given you are
my first and only trial? No.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.486
But this should
restore your powers.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.675
Don't be mad
at Max and Maria, okay?

21:25.719 --> 21:27.329
It was my idea.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.113
I'm sorry. I just...

21:29.157 --> 21:31.420
When I found out
that Alex was missing,

21:31.464 --> 21:33.901
this pain...

21:33.944 --> 21:36.382
crept up in my chest.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.994
It was the same
as when I thought...

21:40.037 --> 21:42.475
I had lost Max for forever.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.433
That day my
whole world

21:44.477 --> 21:48.568
came crumbling down, and I
didn't want yours to shatter,

21:48.611 --> 21:50.700
if there was still hope.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.528
That dose should
be enough.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.800
You treated me
like a child.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.019
Mm-hmm.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.455
And I acted like one.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.371
Oh, I said nasty things
to Deluca,

22:09.415 --> 22:11.373
because I couldn't face myself.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.028
You aren't the reason Alex is... Invisible?

22:14.071 --> 22:15.246
A ghost?

22:15.290 --> 22:16.813
He needed me,

22:16.857 --> 22:18.206
and I was too busy playing
Donnie Brasco

22:18.249 --> 22:19.425
with my new alien besties.

22:21.035 --> 22:25.039
I was so consumed
with finding a way home

22:25.082 --> 22:28.347
that I lost sight of the home
I was trying to build with him.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.089
Blaming yourself's
not gonna bring him back.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.396
You know, we all
make missteps,

22:34.440 --> 22:36.180
even in the strongest relationships.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.053
It just means we got to try
and do better next time.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.708
How's that working out
for you and Evans?

22:41.751 --> 22:44.363
He's making a huge mistake.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.235
I mean, his abilities
are a part of who he is.

22:47.278 --> 22:48.889
But what I have learned
from Alex,

22:48.932 --> 22:51.282
it's that no matter
how hard you...

22:51.326 --> 22:53.633
grasp onto sand...

22:53.676 --> 22:55.939
it still slips
through your fingers.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.595
Max has to go down his own path.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.337
Even if you think
it's a mistake.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.602
Otherwise it's gonna tear
the two of you apart.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.436
Okay, Guru...

23:14.480 --> 23:16.482
let's see if it worked.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.048
See if you
can get me

23:18.092 --> 23:20.181
that wrench.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.755
It's a start,
but I will take it.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.758
Thank you, Ortecho, thank you.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.987
We can sit here,

23:44.031 --> 23:45.902
stoically staring off
into the sunset

23:45.946 --> 23:48.035
like two gruff cowboys,

23:48.078 --> 23:50.777
or we can talk this time.

23:50.820 --> 23:51.995
I can tell your lip

23:52.039 --> 23:53.954
isn't the only thing hurting.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.478
I should have pushed back harder
on keeping Michael in the dark.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.045
Why didn't you?

23:58.088 --> 24:01.265
'Cause I wanted to restore
your faith in me.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.964
I wanted to make sure
that we were okay.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.271
I shouldn't have put
you in that position.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.492
And Michael is upset,
but you guys are family,

24:10.536 --> 24:12.973
and you'll find a way
to make it up to him.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.496
How?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.585
Every single thing I do
feels uncertain.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.718
I mean, I used to know
exactly what to do.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.546
I'm sorry, Max.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.243
I'm so excited

24:22.286 --> 24:24.332
about finally knowing
my path forward that...

24:24.375 --> 24:26.160
I wanted the same for you.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.596
That's the problem.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.729
I don't know
if this is the real me.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.252
You know,
I thought that being

24:31.295 --> 24:33.646
just a normal guy
from Roswell...

24:33.689 --> 24:36.779
I don't know, maybe it's
something else to hide behind.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.868
You know, without my abilities,
I don't feel the pressure

24:38.912 --> 24:40.827
to be everyone's savior.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.481
You know,

24:42.524 --> 24:45.396
I can hold your hand
without worrying I'll hurt you.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.529
But I don't want to be someone
that turns their back

24:47.573 --> 24:50.140
on their family, or...

24:50.184 --> 24:52.491
who's constantly breaking
your heart.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.146
My heart is not broken,
Max Evans.

24:58.932 --> 25:03.023
A much wiser, resurrected-
from-the-dead sister

25:03.066 --> 25:05.199
once told me:

25:05.242 --> 25:08.419
"Expectations only
hold us back."

25:08.463 --> 25:10.552
So without them,

25:10.596 --> 25:13.729
that is how you're
gonna figure out who you are.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.254
I don't know how to do that.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.039
All we can do is try.

25:19.082 --> 25:20.867
Life...

25:20.910 --> 25:23.043
is gonna keep punching...

25:23.086 --> 25:26.002
until you know who you are

25:26.046 --> 25:28.352
and you swing back.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.441
I will always be
on your side,

25:30.485 --> 25:33.009
regardless
of what path you choose.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.329
You don't want to kill me, Tezca.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.113
What you want is more answers.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
What I want
is to silence your lies.

25:55.641 --> 25:59.558
You said it yourself: I have
the ability to see the truth.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.561
Don't you want to know
what you're fighting for?

26:11.352 --> 26:13.702
Show me.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.974
Best me, and you get the fruit.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.110
Listen to me, little star,
I need you to hide.

26:30.153 --> 26:33.679
Make yourself as quiet
and as small as you can.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.158
I'm a warrior, too.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.030
- I can fight.
- The bravest thing you can do

26:37.073 --> 26:39.423
is follow this mission
I'm giving you.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.991
Remember, I'll always find you,

26:42.035 --> 26:44.298
wherever in the universe
you are.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.779
Now, hide, and promise me
you won't come out

26:46.822 --> 26:48.781
no matter what happens.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.664
Where's the girl?

27:02.708 --> 27:03.883
You're too late.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.145
We got her out.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.668
You'll just have
to play with me.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.078
If you're waiting
to hear me beg,

27:25.121 --> 27:27.820
you're gonna die disappointed.

27:29.169 --> 27:32.738
I hate you with the fire
of our two suns.

27:32.781 --> 27:35.915
Well, that sounds
like a challenge

27:35.958 --> 27:38.787
to bend your will to mine.

27:38.831 --> 27:41.311
When I'm done
with you,

27:41.355 --> 27:43.313
you won't love
those children you teach...

27:47.187 --> 27:49.015
...you'll only love me.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.457
We're closed.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.982
Even for a friend
that needs to apologize?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.034
Hey, you got your powers back.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.992
Yup.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.255
You Ortechos know what you're
doing every once in a while.

28:12.299 --> 28:13.692
Hmm.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.043
Listen, Guerin, I...No.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.349
If anyone's saying sorry,
it's me.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.570
I know you love Alex, too.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.267
So that means

28:24.311 --> 28:26.617
we are always on the same side.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.447
We are going to get him back.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.755
That's why I'm here.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.757
Despite what my tantrum
might suggest,

28:35.801 --> 28:39.718
I do believe you are the key to
unlocking whatever Alex needs.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.937
So do your thing.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.158
Try to be a conduit
to connect me to Alex.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.565
That's the song
Alex wrote about us.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.776
Michael, your pendant,

29:37.819 --> 29:39.821
it's glowing.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.178
Maybe with all the lights on...

29:50.179 --> 29:52.312
He's trying to lead us
to where he is.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.923
We got to follow him, then.

30:11.157 --> 30:13.376
Where do we go?
Where do we drive?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.902
Alex would always make fun of me

30:16.945 --> 30:18.947
for carrying around
this old map.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.819
Put your pendant on it.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.615
He's pointing us
to Grant's Pass.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.052
That's where
we got to go!

30:47.497 --> 30:49.935
Shiv? Are you here?

30:49.978 --> 30:52.328
I brought some
of New Mexico's finest bubbly.

30:52.372 --> 30:55.114
It's no Dom,
but it'll do the trick.

31:01.511 --> 31:02.904
Oh, good.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.341
You're here.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.126
What's this equation?

31:07.169 --> 31:08.997
Something remarkable.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.434
After you left,
I got to thinking

31:11.478 --> 31:13.523
about Max's urge for
control, and wondered:

31:13.567 --> 31:15.569
what if we altered
the protein receptors

31:15.612 --> 31:18.441
to perform some, not all,
of their functions?

31:18.485 --> 31:20.574
If we folded the
principle alpha helices

31:20.617 --> 31:22.315
and stabilized
the covalent bonds

31:22.358 --> 31:25.100
between the amino acids... Hey. Slow down.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.059
How did you come up
with this equation?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.234
You're not a scientist.

31:28.277 --> 31:29.844
True, but I am a quick study.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.717
What happened to the mist?

31:33.761 --> 31:36.198
I was cataloguing the
equipment for storage

31:36.242 --> 31:38.505
when my slippery fingers brushed
the release valve,

31:38.548 --> 31:40.637
and I-I might have
inhaled a bit.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.596
Okay, we have to go
to the hospital.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.728
That compound
- could be toxic.
- No, no, no. Liz, I'm fine.

31:44.772 --> 31:47.296
Really. This is a happy
accident, like penicillin.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.168
You have created
a miracle drug

31:49.211 --> 31:51.300
that has opened my mind up
to infinite possibilities,

31:51.344 --> 31:53.607
including one that is
so close to my heart.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.261
What do you mean?

31:55.304 --> 31:57.785
Today's been a day of secrets,

31:57.828 --> 32:00.048
and I've got one more
for you, Lizzie.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.978
I'd like you
to meet someone

32:17.022 --> 32:19.589
very special to me and Allie:
our daughter,

32:19.633 --> 32:21.635
Nicole.
She suffers

32:21.678 --> 32:23.463
from a rare
neurological disease.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.900
We've had to keep her suspended
in a cryogenic state.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.033
She's dead.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.296
She doesn't have to be.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.907
What good is all the
money in the world

32:32.951 --> 32:35.605
if you can't have
what matters most?

32:36.824 --> 32:39.609
Earth science is limited,
so I looked to the stars.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.350
But it turns out

32:41.394 --> 32:45.137
the solution was right here
in Roswell all along.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.315
- You can save our child.
- I can't.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.533
It's too late.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.535
It was too late for your sister.

32:52.579 --> 32:55.147
Rosa seems to be having the time
of her life in New York.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.975
Rosalinda is my cousin.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.411
Come on, Liz!

32:58.454 --> 33:00.543
We have opened up to
each other all day.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.806
Just imagine the greatness
of what we can accomplish

33:02.850 --> 33:05.200
if you simply trust me.

33:05.244 --> 33:09.161
No. What happened with Rosa
was a unique circumstance

33:09.204 --> 33:12.077
that cannot be recreated
in a lab!

33:12.120 --> 33:15.210
And that mist is
for alien physiology.

33:15.254 --> 33:18.257
That will not regenerate
human cells.

33:18.300 --> 33:22.652
I know that. But it can help us
figure out what will.

33:22.696 --> 33:25.090
You have created
something revolutionary.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.528
A compound that boosts
brain power beyond limit.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.486
Imagine the discoveries

33:30.530 --> 33:32.575
at our fingertips

33:32.619 --> 33:35.665
if the brilliant Liz Ortecho

33:35.709 --> 33:37.624
tried just a little.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.627
Everything that you
have ever wanted,

33:40.670 --> 33:43.195
starting with saving
the man that you love.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.861
This is the spot on the map.

33:57.905 --> 34:00.255
There's nothing out here.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.257
Look.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.345
That's Theo's symbol.

34:03.389 --> 34:04.564
Dallas had that yesterday.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.261
His father's glasses
were inside.

34:06.305 --> 34:09.221
We got to keep looking around.
We're going right.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.397
50 paces. Dallas left behind
a page from his dad's Bible.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.748
There were notes in the
margins that led him here.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.359
I don't understand. Is...

34:17.403 --> 34:20.101
Alex with Dallas?

34:20.145 --> 34:21.842
These is getting really weird.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.713
I feel like we should assemble
the pod squad.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.933
Max is useless
without his powers.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.761
That way.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.025
Guys?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.984
Guys, I'm stuck! Help!

34:35.595 --> 34:37.814
- Get back. Stay back.
- Hurry!

34:37.858 --> 34:39.164
Stay back. It's a sinkhole.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.213
Michael, hurry.

34:45.257 --> 34:46.780
I'm trying.

34:46.823 --> 34:48.782
My powers must not be
fully back yet.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.349
- Hurry!
- Maria!

34:50.392 --> 34:51.567
Grab the rope!

35:09.846 --> 35:11.761
Come on!

35:11.805 --> 35:13.502
Oh! Oh, God, I got you.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.721
Are you okay?

35:14.764 --> 35:16.288
What the hell happened?

35:18.551 --> 35:21.684
Maria, what
- are you doing?
- I have to see it. The shimmer.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.295
What shimmer?
You don't see it?

35:23.338 --> 35:24.600
It's not just quicksand.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.036
There's something
behind it.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.690
There's a whole world
down there.

35:27.734 --> 35:28.952
It's like I'm looking
through the alien glass, but...

35:28.996 --> 35:30.432
I see Alex's pendant.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.478
He led us to where he is.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.175
He's alive down there,
I know it.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.350
Alex is down there?

35:35.394 --> 35:36.786
I got to go get him.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.310
- Max, give me the rope.
- Michael, no.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.746
I need to go. Alex needs me.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.269
You are not thinking
clearly right now.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.662
Do not be the idiot
who jumps in a sinkhole.

35:42.705 --> 35:43.750
I have to help him!

35:43.793 --> 35:45.143
I wasn't listening
to him.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.231
I wasn't paying attention.

35:46.274 --> 35:47.971
Look, want to get him back?

35:48.015 --> 35:50.104
I need your head and your
heart here, now. Okay?

35:51.845 --> 35:53.803
Be the thing
that pulls Alex back.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.332
I got you.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.168
How'd you find us out here?

36:10.211 --> 36:13.649
Followed the "notes to self"
Dallas left in the Bible page

36:13.693 --> 36:16.522
once I figured out
where the directions led.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.785
I was gonna tell you at
the station, but, uh,

36:18.828 --> 36:22.092
your fists seemed to want
to do most of the talking.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.705
Uh, about that...

36:25.748 --> 36:27.794
I think I could have expressed
my anger

36:27.837 --> 36:29.796
a little less Hulk-smash.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.886
Well, you were upset.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.757
I reckon you
still are.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.282
And I didn't do you any favors
by hiding the truth from you.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.241
Look, I may not
know who I am,

36:40.285 --> 36:42.330
but I do know
I'm the kind of man

36:42.374 --> 36:44.376
who helps save
the love of his brother's life.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.813
To tell you the truth...

36:46.856 --> 36:49.250
I wish
I could have punched myself.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.513
I wish.

36:51.557 --> 36:54.473
None of that
even matters.

36:54.516 --> 36:55.996
I just care
about getting Alex back.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.304
I got your back, brother.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.961
Why am I the only one
that can see this?

37:05.005 --> 37:06.746
My guess is that your powers
help you act

37:06.789 --> 37:08.269
as an anchor
between dimensions.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.880
I think Alex is able
to use you as a conduit

37:10.924 --> 37:14.406
to communicate by moving things
physically in our world

37:14.449 --> 37:16.190
even while he's
still in his.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.932
Since when are you
a scientist?

37:18.975 --> 37:21.282
Are you coming for Liz's job?
What's going on?

37:21.326 --> 37:24.851
No, just... a hobby I
picked up in New York.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.027
Thank you for today.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.682
You helped me see things
in a new light.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.467
I'm happy that I
was here to help.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.342
You gave yourself up...

37:39.735 --> 37:41.737
...to save me.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.528
Jones locked your memories away.

37:49.571 --> 37:52.095
He thought that you were
in Ophiuchus willingly,

37:52.139 --> 37:54.533
and you were a victim
of his deceit.

38:02.584 --> 38:06.719
What we learned today shows that
we were on the same side once.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.634
So be on my side now.

38:08.677 --> 38:12.115
Tezca, what did Jones
want you to do here?

38:13.116 --> 38:15.249
What is Clyde
looking for?

38:15.293 --> 38:18.078
I don't know
what's real anymore.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.080
Please.

38:26.173 --> 38:29.394
You must remember
something concrete.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.050
He wanted Liz.

38:35.051 --> 38:37.010
Jones said,

38:37.053 --> 38:39.186
once you've gathered
all the pieces...

38:39.229 --> 38:43.799
Liz Ortecho will bring
the alighting.

Let me guess.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.095
Liz's sister.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.706
Racist.

Nothing's worked.

39:41.770 --> 39:45.339
The only way I'll be whole
is if I get my Nicole back.

I've carried...

that kind of loss...

39:49.604 --> 39:51.693
and pain for a decade.

You feel like a piece

is torn out of your chest,
right?

Oh, don't you dare try to relate
to me while your sister

39:57.525 --> 39:58.961
gallivants through
the East Village

39:59.005 --> 40:01.268
with a second chance at life.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.922
If you really empathized,

40:02.965 --> 40:05.011
you would help me.

40:05.054 --> 40:08.449
No. What you're asking for
goes against nature.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.886
You're not thinking through
the consequences here.

40:10.930 --> 40:15.064
Bringing back my sister came
at a painful cost.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.980
Oh, so only the great
Liz Ortecho deserves happiness?

40:18.024 --> 40:19.765

40:24.509 --> 40:26.641

40:28.600 --> 40:30.558

- your true nature.
- I have never been more myself.
