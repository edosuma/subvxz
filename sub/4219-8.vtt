WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:02.293
- Previously on Chicago Fire...
- Go back!

00:02.419 --> 00:06.214
You are not taking my house.
Not without a fight.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.175
Do you think I'm dating Benny?
I'm his daughter, Katie.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.512
- When I needed you most, you left.
- I'm here to say I'm sorry.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.097
Hop in back.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.432
With all eyes on this house,
you think it's a good idea

00:16.558 --> 00:17.892
to bring people on ride-alongs?

00:18.018 --> 00:21.562
- What, I can't have a friend here?
- Help me. Please!

00:21.689 --> 00:25.483
Flaco's dead. We'll take this
to the grave, just me and you.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.610
You've always been there for me.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.487
Yeah. That'll never change.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.534
I promised Heather I'd have this stuff
boxed up and shipped by Friday.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.455
You did a good job taking
care of those kids, Matt.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.460
I'm going to miss coming by
and hanging out with those guys.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.630
You can still come by.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.884
I may not be as good at charades,
but I can be decent company.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.932
Um, all right,
I think that's the last of it.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.771
I'm serious.
You should still come by.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.195
What?

01:12.740 --> 01:18.161
I just feel like we've already been
down this road, you know?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.040
Yeah.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.965
- I'll see you at work.
- Sure.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.015
Kind of unfair that I have to pay rent
and she doesn't.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.476
Life is unfair, Otis.

01:44.605 --> 01:49.108
Whoa. Is that... a Viper helmet?

01:50.402 --> 01:52.153
Uh, yeah. Yes it is.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.447
You're a Battlestar fan?

01:56.492 --> 01:59.952
This the Dual Signature Edition?
Both Hatch and Benedict?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.747
Yeah. I bought it for, like,
350 a few years back,

02:02.873 --> 02:04.832
but it's worth way more
than that now.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.501
Better investment than stocks any day.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.086
That's exactly what I told my mom!

02:11.799 --> 02:15.718
- Hey, morning.
- We blowing off work today?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.054
No.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.682
I put in a transfer
to another house.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.436
You put in a transfer?
What do you mean?

02:26.396 --> 02:29.232
I just wanted, um,
I want a change of scenery.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.651
It's getting stagnant there.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.530
Okay.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.448
For how long?

02:39.201 --> 02:42.912
I... I'm not coming back to 51.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.384
The tech professor was telling me
about some jobs

02:56.510 --> 02:59.679
in heating and cooling repair
that pay real good money.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.474
As soon as you get your degree,
you can look into it.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.767
Yes, boss.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.770
- Hey, Leon!
- Yvette, be careful!

03:07.896 --> 03:10.439
You drive that thing
like a kamikaze.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.984
That girl hasn't listened
to us since we baby-sat her.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.444
Yo, I'm gonna call you
after I get out of class.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.870
Go! Go! Go!

03:27.416 --> 03:29.292
Yvette!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.297
Oh, no, no...

03:36.925 --> 03:40.636
Joe, she's breathing? Joe?

03:42.097 --> 03:43.431
Come on!

03:54.484 --> 03:57.945
I got a gunshot wound to the back of
the neck! I got her pulse back.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.406
Get her into the ambulance,
get her on a monitor.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.289
She's hanging on.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.541
Hell no! I don't need
no damn doctors, man!

04:10.667 --> 04:12.585
- Get the hell up off me!
- Yo, that's Dom.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.837
The Insane Kings have been
after him for a while.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.968
Get out of here.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.597
Just go.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.395
- I recognize you from Firehouse 51.
- Yeah.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.273
Hank Voight, Detective Lindsay.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.067
Joe Cruz.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.443
Hey, did you see what happened?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.570
No, I was around the corner
when the shots were fired.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.156
I... The shooter's car was
gone by the time I ran up.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.909
Yvette, the victim, she, uh...

04:47.245 --> 04:50.414
I know her and her mom.
They're neighbors.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.667
It's a terrible thing,
I hope she's all right.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.422
We'll see if we can get any ID
on the shooter from witnesses.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.927
I know where to find you.
I'm sorry, man.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.697
Excuse me, are you
a real-life firefighter?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.742
Isabella.
Is this your coffee spot?

05:26.868 --> 05:29.328
I remembered you used
to get coffee here.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.539
I was hoping to run into you.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.374
Okay.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.210
I have to go to this black tie event
tomorrow night for work.

05:37.129 --> 05:41.674
Any chance you want to join me?
I'm dateless.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.011
I'd love to but I don't have a tux.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.220
I can get you one.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.639
Come on. It'll be fun.
I promise.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.936
Okay.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.985
Benny sent me Christmas presents almost
every year, so I'll give him that.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.571
Same here. Express mail.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.076
So, um...
What's your real family like?

06:10.787 --> 06:16.834
My mom got married when I was four
and I have two stepsisters. Twins.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.128
Volleyball champions of the world.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.672
Oh, yeah.
A lot of travel, though.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.509
My mom and stepdad are
at their tournaments every weekend.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.303
I'm sure they're proud of you, too.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.392
I don't plan on working here forever.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.563
I'm hoping to start
my own catering company someday.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.939
That's great.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.525
So, what got you into cooking?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.361
Who knows?

06:44.488 --> 06:46.363
I better get back to work though.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.534
It's been a really weird thing,
seeing Benny again,

06:50.660 --> 06:52.620
and finding out about a half-sibling.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.163
A little weird.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.459
Well, it was... It was really nice
meeting you, Kelly.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.715
Hey, any chance you'd want to come by
the firehouse and cook for us?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.133
We'd supply all the ingredients.

07:06.259 --> 07:10.513
And it would be good practice
for the catering gig.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.684
- Sure. That'd be great.
- Yeah? 6:00?

07:15.811 --> 07:20.314
That's perfect.
All right. I'll see you then.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.112
And of course, you know,
my mother's blaming me,

07:26.238 --> 07:27.696
saying that, as her employers,

07:27.823 --> 07:30.658
we should've figured out a way
to keep her in the country.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.911
No offense, but Zoya's English
was a little... No bueno.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.499
Hey, it might boost sales if we got
a bartender who could actually

07:38.625 --> 07:40.126
communicate with the customers.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.794
Zoya's leaving?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.630
Yeah, back to Mother Russia.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.222
Heard Sergeant Voight called here
looking for you. What's that about?

07:55.100 --> 07:58.644
Oh, he's, uh, working a drive-by went
down in my neighborhood this morning.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.730
- I was nearby when it happened.
- Oh.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.950
Good morning, everybody. I have
a quick announcement to make.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.122
Shay has transferred out
of 51.

08:21.209 --> 08:25.296
Transferred as in, like,
past tense, as in not coming back?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.424
Correct. And it is her prerogative.

08:30.635 --> 08:36.515
Look, Shay served this house well.
This here is Alan Choot.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.726
He's gonna be working with us
this shift.

08:38.852 --> 08:43.022
Chout, actually.
Rhymes with "shout."

08:43.148 --> 08:44.565
Great to meet you guys.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.651
I'm sure you will give him
a warm 51 welcome.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.368
- Hey, you're Dawson, right?
- Yeah.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.914
Heard great things about you.
Glad to be here.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.916
Looking forward to seeing
some action.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.131
Hey, did you know about this?

09:09.257 --> 09:12.635
I found out at 7:15 this morning.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.774
Hello, Wallace.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.985
You reneged on a deal.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.613
I changed my mind.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.907
It's within my rights to do so.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.081
You and I, we've had some
disagreements in the past,

09:42.207 --> 09:45.751
but that's to be expected.
And I think we played fair

09:45.877 --> 09:48.837
and were respectful of each other.

09:48.964 --> 09:53.050
And I like my job when I'm working
in a situation like that.

09:56.012 --> 10:00.182
But when someone crosses me
or underestimates me,

10:00.308 --> 10:02.601
I like it even more.

10:05.063 --> 10:11.360
Because it gives me an opportunity
to show exactly what I'm capable of.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.369
Make no mistake.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.499
I'm going to shut down 51.

10:27.043 --> 10:31.547
And when I'm done doing that,
I'm going to bury you.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.435
Hey, Pouch! Get back here.

10:44.561 --> 10:49.064
- Sorry about the busybody.
- No problem. Nice to meet you.

10:49.190 --> 10:53.110
This is my wife Lisa.
That's, uh, Herrmann, Otis and Mouch.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.403
Great to meet you, Lisa.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.989
- Same here.
- Hi. Brian. Nice to meet you.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.074
- It's a pleasure.
- Come here.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.243
- I'll see you later, baby.
- All right.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.539
So you and the wife are
making another go of it?

11:05.665 --> 11:06.749
Yeah.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.587
We went through a rough spot
when I got back from Iraq

11:11.713 --> 11:13.756
and, uh, she was with
this other guy for a while.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.343
But, uh, we put all that behind us.
And so far, so good.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.094
Glad to hear it.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.934
Why is Voight looking for you?

11:27.270 --> 11:31.648
Don't worry, he's just looking into
a shooting in my hood. That's it.

11:34.319 --> 11:39.448
Ambulance 61, Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3. Accident at Broad and Wacker.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.419
Three car accident with multiple
victims. I need two more ambulances.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.129
Copy that, Battalion 25.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.132
Chief, we got the minivan.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.343
Squad, check out the second car.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.720
Capp! You grab the passenger.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.348
Tony, Clarke, you guys grab the pick-up.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.064
Casey, we got two booster seats.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.192
Check for kids.
I'll get in to the driver.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.698
51, drop two lines and charge them.
I smell gas.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.325
Right away, Chief.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.036
No kids! All clear in the back!

12:32.710 --> 12:36.171
Hey there. My name's Matt and we're
going to get you out of here.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.673
Hang tight.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.470
Dawson, I could use help
in the minivan.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.305
On my way. Go help Squad.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.730
She's pinned in pretty good.
I need the small ram.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.399
- Got it.
- Hang on, guys.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.567
Here.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.987
Hey. We got two in the car.
Both are bleeding.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.613
Passenger is unconscious.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.032
Hey! Hey, buddy, what the hell
are you doing?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.870
Get your foot off the pedal!
Get your foot off the pedal!

13:07.996 --> 13:09.913
Capp! Get over here!

13:12.417 --> 13:14.710
That guy caused the whole thing!
Driving like a lunatic!

13:14.836 --> 13:16.837
Let's get you checked out
in the ambo. Come on.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.299
Hey! Hey, get something
to knock him out.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.388
Now, Choot!

13:40.737 --> 13:42.362
Chest laceration,
shortness of breath,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.615
legs pinned,
but seems pretty alert.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.700
Just breathe nice
and easy for us, okay?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.286
- We're going to take good care of you.
- Casey.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.551
I'm going to put
a C-collar on you.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.303
Then you'll be on your way
to the hospital,

14:06.429 --> 14:07.804
where you can see your family.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.140
She'll be free in a second.
Almost ready?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
- Almost.
- Backboard?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.116
Dawson!

14:48.471 --> 14:50.514
I'm good. I'm good.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.349
You okay?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.270
- I'm good.
- Good.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.236
Hit it!

15:12.870 --> 15:14.580
As soon as flames
took over the car,

15:14.706 --> 15:16.164
I was going to jump in
the back myself.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.959
I do a lot of spelunking, so I'm good
with diving into small spaces.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.003
But I wasn't wearing
my fire protective gear.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.212
It was probably best you...

15:22.338 --> 15:24.631
Stayed outside?
Yeah, that's what I figured.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.217
My buddy that I go spelunking with,
he throws these crazy parties

15:27.343 --> 15:28.594
on the weekends, and we all...

15:28.720 --> 15:32.139
Hey, Choot, I could use some quiet
right now. My head's killing me.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.267
It's Chout, actually.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.325
Hey, Lisa. Picked up some...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.743
Hey, baby.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.499
What are you doing here?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.044
Heard about the two of you
getting back together.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.505
Wanted to offer my
heartfelt congratulations.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.799
But Lisa and I still have
unfinished business.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.718
I loaned her money
when we were together...

16:09.844 --> 16:11.678
You're a real
piece of work, Hayes.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.306
I said I'd pay you back.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.433
Get the hell out.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.060
I know all about you.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.605
Lord knows I've heard enough
about it from this one.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.565
I want my money.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.192
Hayes.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.653
I'm not going to
tell you again. Get out.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.459
I swear to God I didn't know
he was coming over. He just showed up.

16:42.585 --> 16:46.046
But I'll take care of it.
Don't...

17:01.646 --> 17:04.481
- That didn't go well.
- That's how he always looks.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.528
Everything all right?

17:09.654 --> 17:10.987
It's fine.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.198
Who was that guy who walked out
right before you?

17:13.324 --> 17:16.868
It's none of your business, Capp.
Drop it. Hit it.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.916
Some cities have gone as far
as to sue to stop cutbacks

17:23.042 --> 17:25.127
in essential emergency services.

17:25.253 --> 17:28.130
- Miami, Omaha, Stamford...
- You thinking about a lawsuit?

17:28.256 --> 17:32.175
It's not a permanent solution, but these
closures that McLeod is implementing,

17:32.301 --> 17:34.803
they're in breach of firefighters'
contract with the city.

17:37.515 --> 17:41.476
We could talk to Sullivan.
President of the union.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.688
We get him to file an injunction
against firehouse closures.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.691
I don't know, Chief. Greg Sullivan
is more about getting his picture taken

17:47.817 --> 17:50.360
than standing up
for his fellow firefighters.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.321
What? You don't you think
it's worth a try?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.617
Considering we are kind of
fighting for our lives here.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.917
Hey, Lieutenant, is Shay
serious about quitting 51?

18:06.043 --> 18:10.297
She transferred to another house.
So, yeah, I'd say she's pretty serious.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.302
It's going to be strange
not having her around.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.763
I think this is just
her feminine side kicking in,

18:17.889 --> 18:20.182
meaning temporary dramatics.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.393
Ten bucks says she's
back here next shift.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.855
Sergeant?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.151
Well, you didn't return my messages,
figured I'd pop by.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.779
Sorry about that.
I've been out on calls all day.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.280
Somewhere we can talk?

18:38.159 --> 18:39.826
Thanks.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.084
Insane Kings have been trying
to take over that turf again.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.629
Yeah, it's been pretty rough
in my neighborhood lately.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.130
I'll bet.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.925
I noticed your brother Leon
was in the Kings.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.720
He was. I'm proud to say
he broke out of that life.

18:58.846 --> 19:02.057
He's on a straight path.
Going to community college now.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.308
Well, congrats on that.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.685
Pretty tough getting out of a gang
once you're jumped in.

19:07.146 --> 19:11.191
It's lucky thing his boss, Flaco,
was killed in that Humboldt Park fire.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.949
That little twist of fate
made a big difference, I bet.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.745
See, I was thinking maybe
Leon could help us.

19:25.540 --> 19:31.628
Our best shot, maybe our only shot,
is to put someone on the inside.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.922
Shooter's bound to start
running his mouth at some point.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.341
Whoa, you want Leon to go
back into the gang?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.761
They'll sniff that out.
They'll kill him.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.930
Not if he plays it right.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.561
We need his help, Joe.
And I'm hoping we get it.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.190
Because as long as I'm focused
on bringing down the Kings,

19:52.316 --> 19:56.486
I won't have time to take a closer look
at what happened at that Flaco fire.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.658
Look. I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.704
As far as I remember,
that place burned to the ground.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.962
You have a decision to make.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.815
Come on in.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.327
It's weird, not having Shay here.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.370
Did you talk to her at all?

20:49.123 --> 20:51.416
Nope. I left another message, though.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.798
That suicide call's
what started all this. And I...

20:58.925 --> 21:01.676
I keep thinking that if I had
just handled it differently,

21:01.802 --> 21:03.845
maybe she wouldn't
have bailed on 51.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.597
You can't second guess yourself.

21:05.723 --> 21:08.934
Shay made the choice to switch houses,
that's on her.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.685
But I was hard on her.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.438
You're the PIC.
Buck stops with you.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.319
When you're in charge of people,
you can't always be best friends.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.279
Don't beat yourself up.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.493
Thanks.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.374
And not to get
all schmaltzy or anything, but...

21:34.085 --> 21:36.336
...thanks for saving
my life today, too.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.216
Yeah. You've done that for me,

21:41.342 --> 21:44.344
like, a million times
in the last few months.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.686
I've been thinking about it.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.106
And...

21:57.900 --> 21:59.734
The truth is...

22:02.738 --> 22:04.698
I don't know where
I'd be without you.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.336
Hey! I had some questions
about stocking the rig.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.381
You guys go through, like, 10 times
the amount of supplies I'm used to.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.758
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Yeah, I can...

22:23.884 --> 22:26.094
Help me out? Cool.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.233
Ready, lift!

22:44.196 --> 22:46.197
Okay, take it down.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.040
- Good.
- We're going again.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.333
Mouch, step out.
Herrmann, take my place.

22:57.460 --> 23:02.922
- Mills. Otis.
- What the hell is going on?

23:03.049 --> 23:05.967
Looks like Casey's got
some serious steam to blow off.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.765
Extreme physical exertion,
food deprivation.

23:11.891 --> 23:16.061
Are we in some kind of CIA training
program I'm unaware of?

23:16.187 --> 23:17.937
Oh, stop it.
She'll be here any minute.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.315
Who is this "she"
you keep talking about?

23:20.441 --> 23:23.026
She's just a chef
at a restaurant near here.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.778
This long a wait?

23:24.904 --> 23:28.573
She better be a stripper-chef,
popping out of a vat of pasta marinara.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.867
Maybe I'll just throw
something together really quick?

23:30.993 --> 23:33.078
If she shows up,
I'll get out of her way.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.913
Go ahead. She ain't coming.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.506
Everything go okay with Voight?

23:46.467 --> 23:47.383
Yeah.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.929
Then why do you look like hell?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.932
It's just been a rough day.
That's all.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.406
- Have you ever worn a tux before?
- Prom.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.076
Well, you rock it.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.538
You are looking
pretty damn good yourself.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.248
Thank you.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.917
I think I've got a plan
for what we're doing tonight.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.461
- Oh, do you?
- Damn straight.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.796
Not here.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.924
- Champagne?
- Oh, thank you.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.551
Thank you.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.387
Cheers.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.472
So who's this Wheeler guy?

24:34.598 --> 24:36.474
State Senator. Rising star.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.269
I would love to run
his next campaign.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.690
- You got a shot at the job?
- I've been told I'm on his radar.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.069
Oh, come on, I see him.
I want to introduce you.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.537
- Senator Wheeler.
- Isabella. Good to see you.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.039
Good to see you too. I'd like to
introduce you to my boyfriend,

25:00.166 --> 25:01.541
Peter Mills.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.254
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.048
Senator, I had some thoughts I wanted
to run by you, when you have time.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.384
- Of course, anytime.
- Perfect.

25:13.596 --> 25:17.098
Me and Leon talked about it
and he doesn't want to do it.

25:17.224 --> 25:21.269
So if you've got any dirt
that you gotta dig up, go ahead.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.148
That how you feel
about it, Leon?

25:29.612 --> 25:31.988
You want to let your brother
roll the dice on this?

25:34.283 --> 25:38.620
Sergeant, would you give us
a second here?

25:42.958 --> 25:46.211
Leon getting himself killed
doesn't help anybody, and if he...

25:46.337 --> 25:48.296
They took Yvette off life support
an hour ago.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.883
She's gone.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.055
I'm sorry, guys.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.393
We're talking about the murder
of a 10-year-old girl here.

26:04.188 --> 26:07.565
You knew her. It's obvious
that you both cared about her.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.905
I want you to help us
stop all of this, Leon.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.660
Help us put away
whoever did this.

26:19.828 --> 26:25.250
We will be with you. We will be
with him every step of the way.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.252
I promise you that.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.465
So will you help us?

26:44.436 --> 26:47.605
- That wasn't so bad, right?
- No.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.944
So, what was this plan you had
for later, huh?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.364
Er, um.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.743
- I gotta ask you a question.
- Answer me.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.120
Um.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.582
Did you bring me here tonight
because you thought

27:06.709 --> 27:10.086
having a black boyfriend
would help you get the job?

27:11.297 --> 27:12.588
Absolutely not.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.300
It's just...

27:16.343 --> 27:18.886
You know, yesterday
we were reconnecting,

27:19.013 --> 27:21.639
tonight I'm your boyfriend.
It's a quick promotion.

27:21.765 --> 27:25.935
It seemed like the simplest way
to introduce you, I guess.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.023
Pete, I like you. That's why
I invited you here tonight.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.525
Okay.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.488
I'm going to grab a cab home.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.035
What...

27:46.582 --> 27:47.999
Sullivan.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.793
I have to make this quick, McHolland.
I have two meetings to get to.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.545
I've got to get to work too.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.340
Did you have a chance to look
at Chief Boden's proposal?

27:55.466 --> 27:56.341
I did.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.259
You know we've got a good case.

27:58.385 --> 28:02.013
But the union has to spearhead it
or we can't push it through.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.183
Problem is, I can't do it.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.393
Why not?

28:07.519 --> 28:11.314
It would be a pretty dumb move
of me to piss off state officials

28:11.440 --> 28:14.233
my first month into the job.
You can understand that.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.571
And let's be honest.
This isn't my fight. It's 51's.

28:30.250 --> 28:35.880
I was handed a lot of dirt
about you during the election.

28:36.006 --> 28:39.634
And I kept it under wraps
because I didn't think it was right

28:39.760 --> 28:42.303
for me to personally benefit
from airing it out.

28:43.347 --> 28:47.100
But to protect my chief and my brothers
and sisters on the job,

28:47.226 --> 28:50.186
I will shout it from the rooftops.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.605
I assume you're referring to my ex

28:52.731 --> 28:54.774
trying to chisel me
for more child support?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.819
Yeah, that probably
would have done some damage.

28:57.945 --> 29:01.364
But the election's over, pal.
Go ahead, climb up on that rooftop.

29:01.490 --> 29:05.159
No one will care, and you'll come across
like a bitter loser.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.247
Lucy Hofnagle.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.253
She's in my book club.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.172
You broke her heart.

29:19.466 --> 29:24.887
Something your current wife would
probably be surprised to discover.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.982
Oh, no.

29:44.491 --> 29:49.328
Voight threatened to look into
what happened with the Flaco fire,

29:49.455 --> 29:52.665
if Leon wouldn't go back
into the gang undercover.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.001
What?

29:59.631 --> 30:03.718
But Leon, he's going to do it,
Lieutenant.

30:06.305 --> 30:10.224
Our neighbor, this young girl.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.978
She died.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.815
He wants to help,
and I can't stop him.

30:19.568 --> 30:23.613
After everything I did to get him out,
now he's going back in.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.199
And it was all for nothing!

30:28.869 --> 30:31.454
Getting him out of there
wasn't for nothing, Cruz. All right?

30:31.580 --> 30:32.747
It steered that kid straight.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.628
You've done everything
you could for him, all right?

30:41.006 --> 30:46.469
Now you have to trust that he'll
make it out on his own this time.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.224
All right?

31:03.487 --> 31:06.906
Chout's back.
I am going to kill this guy

31:07.032 --> 31:08.658
if I have to sit next to him
one more second.

31:08.784 --> 31:09.992
You need to talk to Shay.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.787
I've tried, Dawson.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.666
Maybe you should go by
the apartment, talk to her.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.376
No, I've reached out,
I've left messages.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.461
She shuts me down every time.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.964
She'd rather ride around with that
Devon chick than talk to me.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.259
I don't know what else I can do.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.512
Ambulance 61,
injury at 2909 North Hudson.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.139
Let's rock and roll.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.311
Whoo!

31:41.191 --> 31:42.900
Oh, thank God. This way!

31:43.026 --> 31:45.486
I heard someone coming in
the back door.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.072
I thought it was an intruder,
so I went at him

31:48.198 --> 31:50.741
before I realized
it was just my neighbor, Luis.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.326
You "went at him?"

31:56.081 --> 31:57.665
Whoa.

32:02.045 --> 32:06.591
Look, it's pulsating.
It's directly in the...

32:06.717 --> 32:09.468
- Heart.
- Oh, my God.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.262
If it moves much,
we could lose him.

32:11.388 --> 32:13.264
We have to stabilize
it completely.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.433
Grab the 2-inch tape,
we've got to secure the fork.

32:15.559 --> 32:19.103
- Do you bake, ma'am?
- I'm sorry?

32:19.229 --> 32:23.149
I need a Bundt cake pan.
The kind with a hole in the center.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.817
Yeah, I got one of those.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.197
Chout!
I can't do this without you.

32:30.324 --> 32:31.532
Let's rock and roll.
Come on.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.502
This should stop anything
from knocking into it

32:43.629 --> 32:45.421
or sending it in any deeper.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.964
Whoa.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.216
Hold that there for me,
nice and firm.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.071
Okay, let's get him on
the backboard, nice and slow.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.867
Did you see how impressed that attending
was when he saw the setup?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.160
Yeah.

33:16.286 --> 33:20.706
Hey, I got to ask, what happened
with you and your old partner, Shay?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.543
Sometimes partners go their
separate ways. Happens.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.087
Maybe she was intimidated.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.172
You got to bring the A-game
to be your partner.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.758
You're... You're amazing.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.887
Well, Shay's pretty amazing too.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.223
Hey, you know my buddy Blair,
the one I spelunk with?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.141
His lake house party
is this weekend.

33:39.267 --> 33:42.561
You and me, we should go.
Together.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.025
Chout, you're a really nice guy.
But the thing is...

33:50.112 --> 33:51.570
I'm taken.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.495
Hey, it's Betty Crocker!

33:59.621 --> 34:01.539
Those home-ec classes
finally paid off, huh?

34:01.665 --> 34:04.208
Hey, Choot wants me to tell
your cake pan story on my next podcast.

34:04.334 --> 34:07.086
Apparently,
he's a big fan of the show.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.170
Sorry.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.213
No problem.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.675
Hey, come on, let's go.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.927
You can change at the bar.
We're late for deliveries.

34:22.602 --> 34:25.688
You wanted to see me, Chief?

34:31.903 --> 34:34.405
I just got a call from
the Commissioner's office.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.700
An injunction against McLeod
and her bosses is in the works.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.660
Glad to hear it.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.936
It's just been really crazy.
I'm sorry.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.231
You were never planning
on coming, were you?

35:13.612 --> 35:18.491
I was 10 when I met Benny
for the first time.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.953
He held me really tight
and said how sorry he was

35:23.079 --> 35:25.122
and how he was going to be
in my life.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.335
How I was his daughter.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.673
I can't tell you
how much that meant to me.

35:37.928 --> 35:41.096
The next time I saw him
was two weeks ago.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.396
I'm sorry he disappeared
on you, Katie.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.151
I'm really happy with
my life right now. And I just...

35:55.612 --> 35:57.988
I don't want to spend any more of it
worrying

35:58.114 --> 36:00.991
about another trap door
that might open.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.536
So, I just really hope
that you can understand that.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.165
I can.

36:16.466 --> 36:17.925
Ah.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.763
I'm not Benny.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.043
I'm proud of you.

37:35.837 --> 37:39.131
Hey, Clarke! I thought you were
heading home tonight.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.133
Decided it would
be better to come here.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.301
All right.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.595
Sometimes you need to step away
from a situation

37:44.721 --> 37:46.305
before it goes bad.
You know what I mean?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.435
Yeah, sure. I'm glad you came, then.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.605
Can't have you stepping out of line.

37:56.316 --> 37:59.151
- You got an IPA on tap?
- Help this jarhead out.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.369
- You drink too fast.
- Not fast enough.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.872
If I was drinking now,
I drink fast too.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.835
Cos you're going back to Russia.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.170
Yeah.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.133
I'm going to miss you,
Joe Cruz.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.722
You know, maybe there's a solution
to both our problems,

38:28.848 --> 38:31.225
besides drinking too fast.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.190
I say you marry me.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.485
Joe. You say this
because you are sad.

38:41.611 --> 38:45.906
In Russian, this is
klin klinom vyshybaut.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.367
I have no idea
what those words mean.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.414
I do know that I can't risk losing
someone else I care about.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.293
And I think that we could have
something really great together.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.804
Marry me, Zoya.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.058
Please.

39:14.644 --> 39:17.396
Okay, Joe.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.610
Zoya and I are getting married!

39:25.572 --> 39:27.364
Um.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.284
That's great! Good for you, buddy!

39:30.410 --> 39:32.036
Hey, let's have a drink to that!

39:32.162 --> 39:33.412
Damn right we should!

39:33.538 --> 39:35.873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.959
Come here, you guys.

39:39.085 --> 39:43.172
Hey, congrats, buddy.
That's really great.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.340
Na zdorovie.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.802
They'll probably be married
50 years and have a bunch of kids.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.014
My mom's going to be ecstatic,
I mean, over the moon.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.058
But this is insanity.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.688
- What the hell?
- Dude, the TV's gone.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.734
Shay?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.072
Shay!

40:08.198 --> 40:10.699
My Viper helmet.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.578
Hey, are you okay?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.042
What the hell's going on?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.047
I gave Devon a key.
