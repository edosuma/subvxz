WEBVTT

00:31.115 --> 00:32.275
Not so fast.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.919
You didn't want to be there.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.470
That's why I tried to talk to you.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.806
Glenn told me you saved his life.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.517
He saved mine.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.429
That's how it works
with us, right?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.473
Right.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.726
Hey.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.151
( chuckles )

01:15.326 --> 01:17.191
Get something to eat.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.110
We'll start back at sunup.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.823
Talked to Rick.

01:57.994 --> 02:02.203
Some of them know
what you did at the prison.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.832
Daryl, Maggie.

02:07.003 --> 02:09.369
They accept it.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.879
You wouldn't be here
if they didn't.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.624
Gonna talk to the rest of them.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.044
Tell them to accept it, too.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.974
They don't have to.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.223
No, they do.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.017
They just do.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.063
We don't need to tell them
about the girls.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.152
I don't want to.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.075
Why?

02:42.246 --> 02:45.033
ljust need to forget it.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.911
I got it.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.122
(snarling )

03:42.890 --> 03:46.132
Right there is why
we're waiting for our moment.

03:50.523 --> 03:52.730
Yeah, fair enough.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.113
I owe you everything.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.327
You owe Tyreese.
He was at the prison.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.907
You got back there.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.633
It was in one
of their storerooms.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.394
I saw them kill him.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.521
That kid.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.610
Mm-mmm.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.371
I still don't know
about what you did...

05:00.718 --> 05:04.006
but I know you knew
some things I didn't.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.467
I sent you away to this--

05:15.399 --> 05:18.732
I sent you away to this
and now we'rejoining you.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.733
Will you have us?

05:33.042 --> 05:34.828
Thank you.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.687
I don't want to talk about it.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.152
I can't.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.157
ljust need to forget it.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.791
All right.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.256
( leaves rustling )

06:28.430 --> 06:29.966
( twig snaps )

06:32.977 --> 06:34.808
All right.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.859
It's nothing.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.913
(theme music playing )

07:40.252 --> 07:43.039
We surrender.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.633
No tracks. No nothing.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.589
So whatever you heard
last night...

07:51.764 --> 07:54.380
It's more what I felt.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.719
If someone was watching us,

07:56.894 --> 07:58.509
there would have
been something.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.223
( whistles )
Keep close.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.188
Ready to get some concrete
under your feet?

08:07.363 --> 08:08.899
I think it's time.

08:09.073 --> 08:11.735
That is sweet music
to my ears, Officer.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.570
Take the next road
we come to,

08:13.744 --> 08:15.905
try to get back to going north
till we find a vehicle.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.867
- Good?
- Good.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.407
Tighten it up.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.576
Uh, wet socks.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.119
Cool feet.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.753
Mosquito bites.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.165
Itching reminds you you're alive.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.425
Danger around every corner.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.007
Never a dull moment.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.297
The hot sun
beating down on you.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.091
Come on, a glorious tan.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.805
( laughs)

08:40.979 --> 08:43.186
I said it and I meant it.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.686
No privacy.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.270
Captive audience.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.188
One more.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.027
One more.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.156
He's a damn expert at that.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.195
- What was it?
- A little game.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.740
Good out of the bad.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.125
Man:
Help!

09:05.295 --> 09:07.957
- Help, anybody! Help!
- Dad, come on.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.464
- ( man screaming )
- Come on!

09:10.634 --> 09:12.625
- Come on.
- Anyone, help!

09:12.803 --> 09:14.134
Help!

09:14.304 --> 09:17.091
- ( snarling)
- Help! Help! Help!

09:17.266 --> 09:19.678
Anybody, help!

09:19.852 --> 09:21.342
Help!

09:22.479 --> 09:24.470
Help!

09:24.648 --> 09:26.684
Help! Help!

09:26.859 --> 09:28.815
Help! Help!

09:28.986 --> 09:31.193
Help!

09:31.363 --> 09:33.319
(gunshot)

09:37.786 --> 09:40.823
Whoa! Whoa!

09:49.047 --> 09:51.629
We're clear. Keep watch.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.004
Rick:
Come on down.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.725
You okay?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.658
Sorry.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.999
Yes.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.706
Thank you.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.088
l'm Gabriel.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.589
Do you have
any weapons on you?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.421
( chuckles )

10:38.222 --> 10:40.258
Do I look like
I would have any weapons?

10:40.432 --> 10:44.220
We don't give two short and curlies
what it looks like.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.352
l have no weapons of any kind.

10:47.523 --> 10:50.060
The word of God
is the only protection I need.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.691
Sure didn't look like it.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.813
I called for help.
Help came.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.747
Do you have--

11:07.918 --> 11:10.079
have any food?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.829
Whatever |--

11:14.007 --> 11:17.545
I had left,
itjust hit the ground.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.301
We've got some pecans.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.267
Thank you.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.428
(Judith cooing)

11:32.985 --> 11:35.067
That's a beautiful child.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.164
- Do you have a camp?
- No. Do you?

11:53.589 --> 11:54.920
l have a church.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.797
Hold your hands
above your head.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.633
How many walkers
have you killed?

12:05.976 --> 12:07.466
Not any, actually.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.145
Turn around.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.809
How many people
have you killed?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.809
None.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.818
Why?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.820
Because the Lord
abhors violence.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.328
What have you done?

12:33.337 --> 12:35.498
We've all done something.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.339
I'm a sinner.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.921
l sin almost every day.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.383
But those sins,
I confess them to God,

12:45.557 --> 12:47.764
not strangers.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.550
You said you had a church?

12:53.190 --> 12:56.182
Rick:
Hey, earlier,

12:56.360 --> 12:58.726
were you watching us?

12:58.904 --> 13:00.940
I keep to myself.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.945
Nowadays, people
are just as dangerous

13:03.116 --> 13:04.526
as the dead,
don't you think?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.692
No, people are worse.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.202
Gabriel:
Well, I wasn't watching you.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.113
I haven't been beyond
the stream near my church

13:11.291 --> 13:12.872
more than a few times
since it all started.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.034
That was the furthest
I've gone before today.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.048
Or maybe I'm lying.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.379
Maybe I'm lying about everything

13:23.553 --> 13:25.384
and there's
no church ahead at all.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.011
Maybe I'm leading you
into a trap

13:27.182 --> 13:28.843
so I can steal
all your squirrels.

13:35.399 --> 13:38.015
Members of my flock
had often told me

13:38.193 --> 13:41.276
that my sense of humor
leaves much to be desired.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.061
Yeah, it does.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.758
Hold up.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.341
Can we take a look
around first?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.507
We just want to hold on
to our squirrels.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.886
( whistles )

16:24.109 --> 16:25.189
I spent months here

16:25.360 --> 16:26.725
without stepping out
the front door.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.394
If you found
someone inside,

16:29.573 --> 16:31.234
well, it would have
been surprising.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.907
Thanks for this.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.194
We found a short bus
out back.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.237
It don't run,
but I bet we could fix that

16:39.416 --> 16:40.747
in less than a day or two.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.578
Father here says
he doesn't want it.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.164
Looks like we found ourselves
some transport.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.168
You understand what's
at stake here, right?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.752
Yes, I do.

16:50.927 --> 16:51.916
Now that we can take a breath--

16:52.095 --> 16:53.756
We take a breath,
we slow down,

16:53.930 --> 16:55.261
shit inevitably goes down.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.764
We need supplies
no matter what we do next.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.926
That's right.
Water, food, ammunition.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.937
Short bus ain't going nowhere.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.098
Bring you back
some baked beans.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.854
One way or another,
we're doing what Rick does.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.238
We're not splitting up again.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.403
What he said.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.460
We want to roll with you, but...
what she said.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.427
How'd you survive here
for so long?

17:36.598 --> 17:38.634
Where did your supplies
come from?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.641
Luck.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.973
Our annual canned food drive.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.639
Things fell apart
right after we finished it.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.148
It was just me.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.025
Come here, Judith.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.107
The food lasted a long time.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.567
And then I started scavenging.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.324
l've cleaned out
every place nearby.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.235
Except for one.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.825
What kept you from it?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.660
lt's overrun.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.244
How many?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.831
A dozen or so.
Maybe more.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.956
Rick:
We can handle a dozen.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.295
Bob and I will go with you.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.507
Tyreese should stay here,
help keep Judith safe.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.593
Rick:
That'll be okay?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.598
Sure.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.181
You ever need me
to watch her,

18:25.355 --> 18:28.017
need anything for her,
I'm right here.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.182
I'm grateful for it.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.192
And everything else.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.403
- l'll draw you a map.
- You don't need to.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.485
You're coming with us.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.031
I'm not gonna be of any help.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.866
You saw me.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.292
I'm no good around those things.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.450
You're coming with us.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.833
Listen, I don't trust this guy.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.047
Why?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.630
Why do you trust him?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.717
Everybody can't be bad.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.135
( chuckles )

19:07.314 --> 19:09.726
Well...

19:09.899 --> 19:12.060
I don't trust this guy.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.726
And that's why
I'm bringing him with me.

19:16.031 --> 19:18.067
But he could have friends.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.856
So I need you to stay alert

19:20.035 --> 19:23.027
and help Tyreese
protect Judith, okay?

19:24.247 --> 19:26.078
Now...

19:26.249 --> 19:29.241
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.909
Okay.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.040
You are not safe.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.881
No matter how many
people are around

19:40.055 --> 19:41.920
or how clear the area looks,

19:42.098 --> 19:43.429
no matter what anyone says,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.261
no matter what you think,

19:45.435 --> 19:47.096
you are not safe.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.433
It only takes one second.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.974
One second and it's over.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.111
Never let your guard down, ever.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.817
I want you to promise me.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.573
- I promise.
- Okay.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.609
Dad.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.952
You're right.
I am strong.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.117
We both are.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.457
But we're strong enough

20:15.632 --> 20:18.294
that we can still help people.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.301
And we can handle ourselves
if things go wrong.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.133
And we're strong enough

20:24.307 --> 20:26.263
that we don't have
to be afraid

20:26.434 --> 20:28.550
and we don't have to hide.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.351
Well, he's hiding something.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.316
I'll stay safe, Dad.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.531
All right.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.963
Hey.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.998
When you said
they don't get to live,

20:59.175 --> 21:01.166
you weren't wrong.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.681
We push ourselves
and let things go.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.137
Then we let some more go
and some more.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.347
And pretty soon,
there's things we can't get back.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.979
Things we couldn't
hold on to even if we tried.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.275
Washington's
gonna happen, Rick.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.653
I haven't decided
if we're going.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.688
Yeah, I know, and that's cool.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.823
But you've seen
Abraham in action.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.531
He's gonna get there
and Eugene's gonna cure all this

21:28.705 --> 21:30.366
and you're gonna find
yourself in a place

21:30.540 --> 21:32.246
where it's like how it used to be.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.829
And if you've let too much go
along the way,

21:35.003 --> 21:36.994
that's not gonna work.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.540
'Cause you gonna be back
in the real world.

21:41.718 --> 21:45.336
This is the real world, Bob.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.502
Naw.

21:46.681 --> 21:50.048
This is a nightmare,
and nightmares end.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.225
I'm sorry. I'm calling it.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.604
Washington's gonna happen.
You're gonna say yes.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.935
Already too much momentum.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.567
You can't fight city hall.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.031
Maybe that's just
one of those parts

22:04.199 --> 22:05.530
of not letting go.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.238
Hey, I get it.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.328
You don't want to talk about it.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.744
You okay?

22:18.922 --> 22:20.753
Gotta be.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.756
We get to start over.

22:23.927 --> 22:26.213
All of us with each other.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.176
You saved us all by yourself.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.716
We got lucky.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.850
We all should be dead.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.775
I'll check it.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.604
Daryl:
All right.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.126
Hey.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.083
We ain't dead.

23:03.258 --> 23:06.125
And whatever happened,
happened.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.967
Let's start over.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.058
- I want to.
- Well, you can.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.689
(humming)

23:24.821 --> 23:26.482
We should leave this
here for backup

23:26.656 --> 23:28.772
in case things go south
at the church.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.734
Want me to carry
one of those?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.496
No.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.714
You know, I didn't want
to mention anything

23:43.881 --> 23:45.166
when we looked this place up
in the phone book,

23:45.341 --> 23:47.627
but ljust can't imagine
a gun store

23:47.802 --> 23:49.087
having leftovers nowadays.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.718
Don't look good, does it?

23:50.888 --> 23:53.174
( clattering )

23:58.938 --> 24:00.678
Was it a walker?

24:00.857 --> 24:03.599
Uh, yeah.
It was a walker.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.437
Really?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.479
It was a stack of boxes
and a mop,

24:09.657 --> 24:10.692
andltﬁpped.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.858
-( laughs)
- Still...

24:13.036 --> 24:15.027
got what we came for.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.740
You actually found something?

24:16.914 --> 24:19.656
Three silencers stashed
in a mini-fridge.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.830
Rule number one
of scavenging--

24:23.004 --> 24:24.869
there's nothing left in this world
that isn't hidden.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.131
We're here.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.796
This was the food bank.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.010
lt served the whole county.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.642
All the cans at my church
were gonna end up here.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.957
(splashing )

25:08.424 --> 25:11.416
(walkers snarling )

25:17.600 --> 25:20.592
(snarling continues)

25:36.619 --> 25:38.530
If a sewer could puke,

25:38.705 --> 25:40.741
this is what it'd smell like.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.873
The water's been coming down
that hole for a while.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.759
Slimed this place up good.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.889
Sasha: We can use
the shelves to block them.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.309
Yeah, that's it, Sasha.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.433
There's our way.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.106
Down those shelves.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.152
Hey.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.317
I said you're coming with us.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.995
(snarling )

26:31.174 --> 26:33.256
Rick:
Go! Go!

26:33.426 --> 26:35.257
Here they come.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.419
You take right.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.850
Rick:
I see three here.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.508
You got it?

27:28.898 --> 27:30.638
We have to get Gabriel.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.024
- What happened?
- I don't know.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.150
All right,
we'll push down the shelves

27:35.321 --> 27:36.310
on the ones in front of us.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.899
We'll fight through
and I'll grab him.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.564
Go!

27:45.748 --> 27:47.989
(snarling )

28:09.939 --> 28:12.305
(whimpering)

28:19.240 --> 28:20.776
Yeah.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.941
I know which way
it's gonna break.

28:27.582 --> 28:28.788
Bob!

28:28.958 --> 28:31.199
(snarling )

28:37.717 --> 28:39.628
(grunts)

28:42.680 --> 28:45.672
( panting )

28:48.311 --> 28:50.472
You okay?
Bob, you okay?

28:50.646 --> 28:52.637
I'm fine now.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.694
I'm sorry.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.154
|-- l panicked.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.318
I told you |--

29:07.496 --> 29:09.623
You knew her when
she was alive?

29:15.296 --> 29:17.332
Yeah, I get it.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.713
You only tell your sins to God.

29:27.058 --> 29:29.299
Do you miss the sword?

29:29.477 --> 29:31.263
Wasn't really mine
in the first place.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.642
Foundit
in the very beginning.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.609
How'd you get so good?

29:42.406 --> 29:46.240
It was just me
and them out here

29:46.410 --> 29:49.368
all day, every day

29:49.538 --> 29:51.278
a good long time.

29:53.501 --> 29:56.038
I don't know what that was,
but it wasn't a life.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.666
Not like today.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.132
Stumbling around
in three feet of slime

30:03.302 --> 30:06.590
for some peas and carrots,
that's living.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.012
I miss Andrea.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.721
I miss Hershel.

30:16.899 --> 30:20.608
- Yeah.
- I don't miss what was before.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.734
I don't miss that sword.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.526
Hey.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.570
Tyreese said
you were out back.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.285
Come on in.
We found food.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.450
- A lot of it.
- Good.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.707
What is it?

30:41.924 --> 30:43.915
Those scratches.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.549
They're deep.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.302
Like knives or something.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.258
Someone was trying to get in.

30:54.478 --> 30:56.469
I found something else.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.307
I don't know what happened,
but whatever it is,

31:01.485 --> 31:02.986
we can handle it.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.364
Doesn't mean Gabriel
is a bad guy for sure,

31:08.534 --> 31:12.118
but it means something.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.970
(laughing, chatting)

31:34.727 --> 31:37.059
Ooh, give me-- ah.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.436
I'd like to propose a toast.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.598
( chatter stops )

31:43.444 --> 31:45.230
I look around this room...

31:47.615 --> 31:49.401
and | see survivors.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.985
Each and every one of you

31:54.163 --> 31:56.495
has earned that title.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.289
- To the survivors.
- Survivors! Cheers!

32:02.463 --> 32:03.623
( overlapping voices )

32:03.798 --> 32:04.833
Cheers.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.463
Carol:
Survivors.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.340
Is that all you want to be?

32:11.347 --> 32:13.963
Wake up in the morning,
fight the undead pricks,

32:14.141 --> 32:15.130
forage for food,

32:15.309 --> 32:16.810
go to sleep at night
with two eyes open,

32:16.977 --> 32:18.808
rinse and repeat?

32:18.979 --> 32:20.844
'Cause you can do that.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.605
I mean, you got the strength.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.732
You got the skill.

32:26.821 --> 32:29.028
Thing is, for you people,

32:29.198 --> 32:33.157
for what you can do,
that's just surrender.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.658
Now, we get Eugene
to Washington

32:34.829 --> 32:36.114
and he will make the dead die

32:36.288 --> 32:37.789
and the living will have
this world again.

32:37.957 --> 32:41.199
And that is not a bad takeaway
for a little road trip.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.867
(coos)

32:43.045 --> 32:44.546
Shh.

32:45.965 --> 32:49.378
Eugene, what's in DC?

32:52.888 --> 32:55.345
Infrastructure constructed
to withstand pandemics

32:55.516 --> 32:58.178
even of this fubar magnitude.

32:58.352 --> 33:01.719
That means food, fuel, refuge.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.563
Restart.

33:08.237 --> 33:11.274
However this plays out,

33:11.448 --> 33:13.905
however long it takes
for the reset button to kick in,

33:14.076 --> 33:16.818
you can be safe there.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.578
Safer than you've been
since this whole thing started.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.913
Come with us.

33:25.087 --> 33:27.578
Save the world
for that little one.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.253
Save it for yourselves.

33:38.142 --> 33:40.053
Save it for the people
out there...

33:42.062 --> 33:45.429
who don't got nothing left
to do except survive.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.281
( chuckles )

33:58.037 --> 34:00.073
-(coos)
- What was that?

34:00.247 --> 34:01.236
( laughter)

34:01.415 --> 34:04.122
I think she knows
what I'm about to say.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.784
She's in.
If she's in, I'm in.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.123
-We're in.
- ( all laughing)

34:09.298 --> 34:10.913
- ( clapping )
- Tyreese: Yeah.

34:11.091 --> 34:15.130
- Let's do it.
- ( cheering )

34:22.519 --> 34:24.726
Okay.

34:24.897 --> 34:25.977
I'm not letting my brother
be the only one

34:26.148 --> 34:27.137
that gets to hold that baby.

34:27.316 --> 34:28.647
( laughs)

34:28.817 --> 34:30.557
Wait.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.319
One more.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.524
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:13.696 --> 35:16.062
l was at the prison.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.856
With the Governor.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.196
I didn't know who he was

35:26.375 --> 35:28.536
or what he could do.

35:28.711 --> 35:32.203
And I didn't know
who all of you were.

35:37.928 --> 35:42.888
|-- | just didn't
want it to be hidden.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.514
That I was there.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.730
You're here with us now.

35:59.241 --> 36:02.028
( footsteps approaching )

36:07.374 --> 36:09.080
Thanks for the hospitality.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.745
I'm surprised you let us drink
your communion wine.

36:17.593 --> 36:20.005
There isn't anyone left
to take communion.

36:22.139 --> 36:25.176
The wine's just wine
until it's blessed.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.348
You're hiding something.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.732
And it's pretty obvious

36:35.903 --> 36:38.315
it's something you
can't hide from.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.775
That's your business.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.529
But these people,

36:44.703 --> 36:48.116
these people are my family.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.616
And if what you're hiding

36:51.794 --> 36:55.582
somehow hurts them
in any way,

36:55.756 --> 36:57.121
I'll kill you.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.295
(engine idling)

37:07.643 --> 37:10.134
(walker snarling )

37:23.575 --> 37:26.282
( rustling )

37:31.542 --> 37:33.078
What are you doing?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.835
I don't know.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.212
Come on.

37:42.386 --> 37:44.377
(car approaching )

37:57.776 --> 37:59.061
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

37:59.236 --> 38:00.351
What are you doing?

38:01.864 --> 38:03.820
They got Beth.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.153
Come on.
Come on, get in.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.827
(tires squealing )

38:43.238 --> 38:46.355
(sobbing )

38:54.666 --> 38:56.122
(grunts)

39:24.571 --> 39:26.607
You waking up?

39:26.782 --> 39:29.444
Ah, you're back with us, huh?

39:29.618 --> 39:31.950
Good news is...

39:32.120 --> 39:34.532
you're not dead yet.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.788
That's a relief, right?

39:36.959 --> 39:39.701
But try not to read too much
into the word "yet" there.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.414
lt'll just drive you crazy, Bob.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.968
I want to explain myself a little.

39:51.139 --> 39:56.133
You see,
we didn't want to hurt you...

39:57.646 --> 39:59.978
before.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.981
We didn't want to pull you
away from your group

40:03.151 --> 40:04.357
Ol' scare you.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.895
These aren't things
that we want to do.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.485
They're things we got to do.

40:14.288 --> 40:17.325
You and your people
took away our home.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.538
That's fair play.

40:22.713 --> 40:26.205
Now we're out here
like everybody else

40:26.383 --> 40:28.169
trying to survive.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.502
And in order to do that,

40:32.681 --> 40:35.047
we have to hunt.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.849
Didn't start that way,

40:42.024 --> 40:43.514
eating people.

40:43.692 --> 40:46.308
lt evolved into that.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.192
We evolved.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.524
We had to.

40:50.699 --> 40:54.692
And now we've devolved

40:54.870 --> 40:56.531
into hunters.

40:58.332 --> 40:59.822
I told you.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.662
I said it.
Can't go back, Bob.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.381
| just hope
you understand

41:09.551 --> 41:13.590
that nothing happening
to you now is personal.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.846
Yeah, you put us
in this situation,

41:16.016 --> 41:19.884
and it is almost
kind of a cosmic justice

41:20.062 --> 41:22.474
for it to be you, but...

41:24.650 --> 41:26.515
we would have done this
to anybody.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.478
We will.

41:33.241 --> 41:36.233
But at the end of the day,

41:36.411 --> 41:39.403
no matter how much we hate
all this ugly business...

41:45.253 --> 41:47.118
a man's got to eat.

41:47.297 --> 41:50.630
( breathing rapidly)

42:03.897 --> 42:05.353
If it makes you feel any better...

42:06.817 --> 42:09.604
you taste much better
than we thought you would.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.915
