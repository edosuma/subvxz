        and I'm certainly

you are gorgeous.

your college tuition,

for her homecoming dance.

there and be the queen

15:04.271 --> 15:05.670
I'm late for school.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.872
            Relax, cuz,
            we just gonna hold
            'em for you.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.407
     Come on, Eazy,
     I got to get
     to class, man.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.242
I like these.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.211
Oh, you think you something,
you got your little soldier
backpack on--

15:13.213 --> 15:14.779
         What the fuck?

15:14.781 --> 15:18.917
  I swear to God, I'll blow
  your head off if you've
scuffed up my Chucks, nigga!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.086
  You crazy or some shit? Huh?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.292
           Hey, he must be.
           Check out his gear.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.628
Shit looks like it's
straight from the Goodwill
or some shit.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.432
      We got a problem, nigga?

15:38.371 --> 15:44.409
This motherfucker's retarded.
Let me chill out, man.
I'm-- I'm crazy today.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.710
            Chauncey?

15:47.213 --> 15:48.513
            Oh, man!

15:53.086 --> 15:55.053
  Hey, get out of here, man.
Get the fuck outta here.

15:55.055 --> 15:58.323
Filming this shit.
With your skinny jeans.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.500
       [school bell rings]
        [girl] Hey, girl.

16:10.937 --> 16:15.506
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Compton High's
homecoming queen,

16:15.742 --> 16:17.308
     Lisa Walker.
                    Aw.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.310
But I really don't think
that's how it's gonna
turn out.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.378
   You never know.

16:20.380 --> 16:25.249
   You better watch your back,
or you just might not
   make it to the dance.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.386
      Why do you always act like
      you're auditioning
      for <i> Love & Hip Hop</i> ?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.356
Does that girl just, like,
wake up with drama?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.957
Yeah.
                         Mm-hmm.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.327
  Ooh! I like that little skirt
  you got on, girl! Ha!

16:37.263 --> 16:42.500
     Yah! Guess who is about
    to be at Big Boy
     tomorrow after school?

16:42.936 --> 16:43.968
  [both] Who?

16:43.970 --> 16:46.604
              Unique! [screams]
   Oh, my God.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.606
          Girl, he is so fine!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.108
          I love his new song,
          "Hoochie Love."

16:50.110 --> 16:52.543
     Yo, that song is mad corny,
     though. Like...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.178
         [girls] Hater!

16:54.180 --> 16:56.714
 -You feel me with this, right?
 -I don't know. Hey, hey!

16:56.716 --> 16:58.616
My peoples, what's good?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.618
     So, yo, peeps,
     my parents are going
     out of town this weekend,

17:00.620 --> 17:02.520
          so, you already know
          what time it is.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.623
       Party at my crib.
       Pre-homecoming turn-up.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.525
  You ready to get a little...
  [vocalizing]

17:07.527 --> 17:09.493
How we get down!

17:09.496 --> 17:13.196
Whoo! Hey, you already know it
ain't no party without D-R-E!
What you thought?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.133
    Dre, stop playin', nigga.

17:16.970 --> 17:20.438
You know my rules,
no running in my schoolyard
or my courtyard.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.107
               Whatever.
  Get to class.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
           Mr. Hurd
           a gangsta for real.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.982
           [all] Yeah!

17:30.984 --> 17:33.484
    Guys, guys. I just saw...
    [panting]

17:35.255 --> 17:36.721
                  He's back...
What? What?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.322
              Yo, what are you
              babbling about?

17:38.324 --> 17:39.891
Calm down, Derrick.
Who's back?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.727
    Chauncey. Chauncey Page.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.936
       [school bell rings]

18:07.787 --> 18:09.754
  [teacher] I know you guys
  don't want to hear it,

18:09.756 --> 18:13.524
   but I need you to read
   chapters six through seven
   over the weekend.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.327
 Do questions one through five.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.263
  They will not take you long.

18:19.699 --> 18:23.201
And now, um, it's time
to pass out your midterms,

18:23.203 --> 18:28.339
and I am proud to announce
that there was one A-plus
in the class,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.676
and it went to Ty Reynolds.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.147
           [softly] Thank you.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.282
             [coughs] Punk-ass
             teacher's pet.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.788
Do better on the next one.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.070
       [school bell rings]

18:59.072 --> 19:01.038
Have a happy homecoming
weekend, guys.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.054
Derrick, I want to talk
to you after class.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.024
Meet us in
the lunchroom, okay?

19:23.496 --> 19:26.597
So, is there something going
on that I should know about?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.666
                What you mean?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.701
I mean the decline
in your grades this semester.

19:31.137 --> 19:36.174
  You have gone from
  an 80% average in this class
  to a 65%.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.676
 How 'bout these percentages...

19:39.012 --> 19:43.848
   The number one cause of
   death among young black men
   from 15 to 34? Murder.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.217
        Ninety-three percent of
        murder victims

19:46.219 --> 19:48.386
      are killed
      by someone who shares
      their race,

19:48.388 --> 19:49.987
    and according to the CDC,

19:49.989 --> 19:52.456
   last year, young black men
   from 15 to 34

19:52.458 --> 19:55.893
  were 10 times more likely
  to die of murder than
  whites of the same age group.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.164
So what? You're gonna tank
your entire senior year

20:00.166 --> 20:02.700
and let the ills of the world
determine your fate?

20:03.002 --> 20:07.605
  My point is, my fate has
  already been decided for me.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.812
                  You done?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.053
What a waste.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.288
           [Derrick] Ridiculous.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.127
                       Nonsense.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.228
           You got five minutes?
           Look at all this.
                       Hey, hey.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.663
Look, forget all that.
You still DJing
my party this weekend?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.232
      Oh, man, you already know.
        Okay, then.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.567
     Yeah, especially if
     Kim will save me a dance.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.837
    Could we just focus
    on what's most
    important right now?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.439
Chauncey.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.074
Yo, you sure
it was really him?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.309
          Sure looked like
          Chauncey to me, man.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.389
    [Kim]
    I can't believe they just
    let him out like that.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.691
      He killed my sister.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.728
         Because of us.

21:03.730 --> 21:07.398
    Hey, don't say that, okay?
    It was an accident.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.100
What up, bustas?

21:10.036 --> 21:13.537
Ty, I thought you wanted
to meet, alone.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.273
               Yo, Gina, Dre.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.275
    Y'all gotta check this.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.779
So? Who the crackhead?

21:21.781 --> 21:24.115
That's Chauncey Page, man.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.784
Y'all play too much. I'm out.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.718
He's not joking.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.787
I don't give a fuck!

21:29.789 --> 21:31.722
If Chauncey back in the hood
and want to get at us for some
old-school shit, trust me,

21:31.724 --> 21:33.457
I got something
waiting for his ass.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.992
 Yeah, well, keep it down, Dre.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.495
Chauncey got y'all actin'
like some scared-ass bitches.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.063
   Yo, shut the hell up, man.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.565
     What? What you gonna do
     about it, pretty boy?

21:41.567 --> 21:44.835
      Stop puttin' us on blast
      before I shut you up.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.338
Oh, so now your punk ass
wanna act hard, huh?

21:47.340 --> 21:50.541
Better save that shit for
Lisa's virgin ass on
Saturday night.

   -What's up, boy? What's up?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.218
        Get off me, sir!
        He hit me first!

22:02.288 --> 22:04.021
You kids go back,
finish your lunch.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.990
  You, let's take a walk, man.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.593
           -You okay?
           -I'm fine.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.362
What are we gonna
do about this?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.164
                      Nothin'.

22:15.034 --> 22:19.837
              Mm. Now, that...
              that was sexy.

22:32.185 --> 22:37.188
  Ah. So, you out of jail now,
  huh, killer?

22:38.224 --> 22:39.256
                   What?

22:58.478 --> 22:59.543
            Sit down.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.113
           I said sit down, kid.

23:07.353 --> 23:10.221
     You know, I know your whole
     story, Andre Dixon.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.390

23:12.392 --> 23:15.593
   Bought a nice home out in
   Baldwin Hills. Real bougie.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.295
     Here you are, actin' like
     you an Inglewood gangsta.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.932
  You ain't no hard rock, boy.
  'Bout as hard as my dick.

23:21.934 --> 23:25.503
So what? I'll still
whoop your old ass.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.807
          You know, when I got
          out of the military,

23:30.343 --> 23:34.412
I taught schools in Chicago,
New York, Detroit...

23:35.281 --> 23:39.150
and I came across a lot of
young thugs, like you.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.520
            Tryin' to be a man
            before their time.

23:44.357 --> 23:48.092
          You a man?
          Take your best shot.

triflin'-ass, pants-saggin',

tryin' to be hard.

    for that bullshit, Andre.

24:09.715 --> 24:10.981
 Do you know why?

24:11.884 --> 24:14.051
Huh? Do you know
why I gotta act hard?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.187
 Do you?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.489
So I can walk down the street

24:18.491 --> 24:20.991
and not have to worry about
a Blood or a Crip trying
to kill me.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.394
Or some punk-ass police
lookin' to kill me.

24:23.396 --> 24:25.830
Or a group of hoods tryin'
to punk me.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.033
I have to act hard to survive.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.981
Can I go now?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.485
               Yeah, you can go.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.089
        I don't want to have
        this conversation again.

        [hip-hop playing
        on stereo]

25:00.800 --> 25:03.267
              Ladies, this dance
              sets the stage

25:03.269 --> 25:07.304
   for all that the Compton High
   homecoming queen symbolizes.

25:07.306 --> 25:11.609

               and intelligence.

         that you're not capable
         of representing that,

25:20.353 --> 25:23.687
    then you should decline
    your homecoming nomination
    right now.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.077
     [footsteps approaching]

26:25.084 --> 26:27.751
       Hello? Who's there?

26:29.589 --> 26:31.021
              Hey!

26:41.534 --> 26:42.933
            [screams]

26:43.636 --> 26:48.973
    Ladies, stop! Gina, stop!
    Get off of her! Stop!

26:48.975 --> 26:49.974
                         Gina!

26:50.376 --> 26:53.310
           Back! What the hell
           is this all about?

26:53.312 --> 26:54.945
              She just came in
              and attacked me.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.046
                          Why?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.781
   She thinks I stole her man.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.283
              Is this true?

26:59.652 --> 27:03.220
Why, you want him too?
'Cause everybody knows
you fuck seniors.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.624
  Gina, get your stuff
  and get the hell out of here.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.791
           Wait, what?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.660
       No, and you're out
       of the competition.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.794
What?

27:10.796 --> 27:12.830
  No, no, no! This is my shot!

27:12.832 --> 27:15.299
          No. Goodbye.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.505
        You bitch. Move!

27:21.507 --> 27:24.708
Lisa, let's get back to work.
And you fellas,
get out of here.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.915
                Hey, you okay?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.150
          No.

27:33.953 --> 27:39.156
              Look, come here,
              come here.
              It's all right.

27:39.959 --> 27:44.428
        Look, I gotta go.
        See you later?

27:48.768 --> 27:51.368
      [door opens, closes]

28:35.981 --> 28:43.120
  [voices]
 <i> Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey!</i>
 <i> Chauncey! Chauncey!</i>

28:43.589 --> 28:44.888
        Chauncey did it.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.634
    Get in. We need to talk.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.783
   Okay, um... I'll take this.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.021
   Yo, what's wrong with you?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.524
[sighs] Yo, can I
ask you a question?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.093
              What?

29:23.395 --> 29:25.462
    You really think Chauncey
    back in the hood?

29:27.099 --> 29:31.301
     I don't know. I mean,
     Derrick's the only one
     that's "seen" him.

29:33.372 --> 29:37.141
You ever, you know,
think about that day?

29:41.147 --> 29:42.613
           Sometimes.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.149
               What, you scared?

29:45.151 --> 29:47.050
      Of Chauncey? Hell no!

29:47.052 --> 29:51.722
 Shit!
  Okay, cool. So then can we
  stop all this Chauncey gossip?

29:51.724 --> 29:54.658
    Look, now, I know you got
    a serious beef with Ty.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.060
     Oh, I can't stand that
     bitch-ass pretty boy.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.530
        And I ain't got
        no love for Lisa.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.465
        So, I was, uh...

30:02.101 --> 30:07.404
 I was thinking, maybe we could
hook up, figure something out.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.476
[laughs]

30:12.845 --> 30:14.278
        All right, then.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.080
      But, uh, what about
      after this, you know?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.550
  What if we hook up, someday?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.853
    Ew. Don't get it twisted.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.757
      Boy, this is strictly
      about vengeance.

30:26.759 --> 30:30.427
     [hip-hop music playing
     on stereo]
          Ew, that's disgusting.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.165
  [Gina continues, indistinct]

30:35.534 --> 30:38.669
           [dog barks]
        Damn, $20 cash
        for a rock, man!

30:38.671 --> 30:41.205
     Get the fuck outta
     here with that burrito!

30:43.943 --> 30:46.510
         Hold up, I need
         to take a leak.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.799
  Mother-- What you doin', man?
  Hey, yo, beat his ass!

     Where's my-- Oh, shit!
     How'd you get my strap?

31:27.553 --> 31:30.420
Hey, look, cuz,
I wasn't gonna
kill you, man.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.390
Come on, man,
I wasn't gonna
kill you.

31:35.427 --> 31:39.730
       Go ahead, man.
       Squeeze that shit.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.008
Shit. I knew you was a bitch.

31:55.848 --> 31:56.580
            [groans]

31:56.582 --> 31:59.583
      Oh, fuck! [groaning]

   [continues, indistinct]

33:29.108 --> 33:30.407
           Guess who.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.778
      Oh. You look like you
      were up all night.

33:34.780 --> 33:38.248
  I was. The nightmares again.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.450
       I thought you said
       you were getting
       meds for that.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.885
  They're not working anymore.

33:42.488 --> 33:47.057
  Yo! Who wants to come with me
after school down to Big Boy

33:47.059 --> 33:51.128
      to stalk Unique for
      some hoochie love?
         [all laughing]

33:51.130 --> 33:55.032
    She's gonna ask him
    to be her homecoming date
    and post it on the 'Gram.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.301
    Unique? Kim, he is so corny!

33:58.303 --> 34:00.303
    Eddie, you are so corny!

34:00.305 --> 34:01.738
         [all laughing]

34:01.740 --> 34:03.974
    That sounds like a plan,
    I guess.

34:03.976 --> 34:05.409
               I love you.

34:07.146 --> 34:11.547
Yo, um... Y'all see
what happened to Eazy Hicks
on Snapchat?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.550
           -No.
           -[Ty] What?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.322
They posted him dead
last night.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.456
       [Tiffany] Oh, shit.

34:20.893 --> 34:24.828
Now, I saw Chauncey
in his face yesterday...

34:25.864 --> 34:28.098
You think Chauncey killed him?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.065
[Derrick] Maybe.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.636
Maybe one of us is next.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.274
We should go to the police.
      [Ronny] And tell 'em what?

34:37.275 --> 34:39.909
    Because we lied on
    Chauncey four years ago,
    he's after us?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.578
       Man, I can't live
       through this again.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.748
             What? Are y'all
             for real right now?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.617
             I'm the one
             who lost my sister.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.154
             Can we stop talking
             about this?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.190
              No police, okay?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.295
                Fine. No police.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.163
          [bell rings]

35:00.365 --> 35:02.165
I'll see you guys
after school.

35:06.572 --> 35:09.940
   [coach yelling, indistinct]

35:11.710 --> 35:16.379
      Yeah, dig in! Dig in!
      Come on, now!

35:16.381 --> 35:18.949
     [continues, indistinct]

35:20.252 --> 35:22.219
Dig in!

35:48.413 --> 35:53.216
I'm sorry. You sound like
one of those paranoid
white girls in a scary movie.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.520
      Boo! [laughing]

36:03.428 --> 36:05.095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.997
       I apologize.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.699
So... [clears throat]

36:10.335 --> 36:14.271
Have you actually seen
Chauncey Page since
his release?

36:14.273 --> 36:18.441
     No. But my friend recorded
     a video of him walking down
     the street.

36:18.443 --> 36:19.609
   A video?

36:20.145 --> 36:23.213
Has Chauncey Page made
any direct contact with you

36:23.215 --> 36:25.715
or any of your friends
since his release?

36:26.451 --> 36:27.984
                     No. But--

36:27.986 --> 36:30.687
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.124
Chauncey Page comes home...

36:35.494 --> 36:37.561
after serving four years
in juvie,

36:37.563 --> 36:43.266
and the first thing he does
is stalk you and your friends
on homecoming weekend.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.802
                  Look, it's--
Ah-ah. Ah.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.872
Chauncey did the crime, and he
served the time.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.610
I can't just run around
pointing fingers at people
without concrete evidence,

36:53.979 --> 36:56.780
unless there's something
you're not telling me.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.986
      [sighs] I did hear that
      Chauncey got into it
      with Eazy Hicks yesterday.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.356
    The same guy they found dead
    on 30th Street last night.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.924
Wait, where'd you hear that?

37:07.926 --> 37:10.660
           The streets talk
           every day, Detective.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.095
        You just gotta listen.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.265
          Okay.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.501
       I'll check him out,

37:18.503 --> 37:22.105
     only if you promise me
     you'll forget about
     Chauncey Page

37:22.107 --> 37:25.775
    and start enjoying your
    homecoming weekend. Huh?

37:27.679 --> 37:28.945
                     Deal.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.152
        You look so hot.
        He's gonna notice you.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.923
   Hey, girl, we waited, like,
   30 minutes after school.
Mm-hmm.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.591
      We called, we text--

37:41.593 --> 37:43.893
 Sorry, homies, I left my debit
 card at home this morning,

37:43.895 --> 37:46.896
 and then my phone died after I
 took an Uber home after school
 to go get it.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.632
Mm-mmm. Girl, we had
to give you the deuces.

37:48.634 --> 37:52.636
I told you, nobody is standing
in the way of me and Unique.
Okay?

37:53.205 --> 37:54.671
[Tiffany] Yeah, man,
that's messed up.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.539
   [man]
   Unique, I love your story,

37:56.541 --> 37:59.609
    and the reason why
    I love your story is
    because it's one of those

37:59.611 --> 38:02.445
    that "started from
    the bottom, now I'm here"
    type of stories.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.214
Yeah, yeah,
and I ain't goin'
back, either.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.449
   -I heard that, man.
   -No disrespect to the hood,

38:06.451 --> 38:09.219
but if you really from
the hood, you ain't
never tryin' to go back.

38:09.221 --> 38:11.254
         That's real. Let me
         ask you this, though.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.690
    What about your fans
    that's still in the hood?

38:14.226 --> 38:17.560
Man, I say, uh,
I made it out,
so you can too.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.396
                   True story.
And if you a little lady,
you know,

38:19.398 --> 38:22.399
I'll come get you out for
a little bit of that, uh...

38:22.401 --> 38:24.567
        <i> ¶ Hoochie love ¶</i>

38:24.569 --> 38:28.138
  Yeah, boy. And they have
  females that just ran up here
  to see you today too, man.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.739
Hey, man, come--
come see me.
            What that feel like?

38:29.741 --> 38:31.841
Hey, it feel good.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.910
       I heard-- I wouldn't know
       what it feels like, man.
       You know, I don't have--

38:33.912 --> 38:35.578
           Well, sometimes
           the parking attendant
           meet me out in front,

38:35.580 --> 38:37.080
          but other than that,
          you know...
Word!

38:37.082 --> 38:38.448
          See, singers,
          y'all get that, man.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.016
      I been doin' this
      radio thing, brother.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.851
       I don't have what
       you have. You know?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.753
You know, we just gotta
let it do it...

38:43.755 --> 38:45.588
      I would make an album,
      but I can't sing
      and nobody would buy it.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.091
      My bad for how
      I was acting earlier.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.360
  You know, news about
  Chauncey, it just got to me.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.863
Can we just please stop
talking about Chauncey and
just focus?

38:53.865 --> 38:56.399
O-M-G.
           [all screaming]

38:56.968 --> 39:01.338
Oh, my God! [screams]
I love you, Unique! [screams]

39:02.474 --> 39:03.606
           Oh, my God!

39:03.608 --> 39:10.113
[chuckles] Yo, babe.
Where was you when I was
shootin' my first video?

39:10.115 --> 39:12.015
      Can you show me some
      hoochie love, Unique?

39:12.017 --> 39:14.184
Why don't you show me
what you workin' with?

39:20.125 --> 39:23.026
     All right, damn, girl.
     But check this--

39:23.295 --> 39:25.362
    About to hit the studio.
    You wanna roll?

39:25.664 --> 39:27.230
         Oh, my God, yes! Yes!

39:27.232 --> 39:30.533
Okay, wait. Wait, wait.
How old are you?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.736
  I just turned 18 last month.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.537
      [laughs]

39:34.539 --> 39:35.905
Cool.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.313

    Bacon-wrapped bastard!

53:58.569 --> 54:00.836
    You just got home,
    and they fucking with you
    already!

54:00.838 --> 54:05.074
   Can't stand them
   motherfuckers!
   Come on in here, Chauncey!

54:19.190 --> 54:21.757
[Daddy] Lisa, your
homecoming date is here!

54:23.394 --> 54:24.360
             [sighs]

54:29.467 --> 54:31.033
           Oh, thanks.

54:31.235 --> 54:33.636
[gasps] Oh!

54:34.272 --> 54:36.605
Oh, wow. You look amazing.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.207
You don't look
too bad yourself.

54:38.209 --> 54:39.208
           Thank you.

54:39.210 --> 54:40.976
How's your ankle?

54:40.978 --> 54:43.779
   Uh, team doctor said
   it is a slight sprain.
   I'll be out for six weeks.

54:43.781 --> 54:47.283
    Now, Ty, tell me again,
    how did you hurt yourself
    during halftime?

54:47.285 --> 54:50.552
  You know that's like getting
  fired on your day off, right?

54:50.554 --> 54:52.921
      Uh... I-- I slipped.

54:52.923 --> 54:55.924
                    [chuckles]
Daddy! Can't you see
he's already upset?

54:55.926 --> 54:59.328
     No, no, no, it's okay,
     it's okay. You'll have
     another chance, right?

54:59.330 --> 55:00.396
            [grunts softly]

55:00.398 --> 55:02.031
    You ready to go?
                    Yes.

55:09.974 --> 55:12.207
I don't condone this, son.

55:13.978 --> 55:16.011
But maybe you better
take these, just in case.

55:16.747 --> 55:20.249
Look, I know she lost
her twin sister
and everything years back,

55:20.251 --> 55:25.054
but I've heard nothing
but nasty things about
that Kim Morris.

55:25.856 --> 55:27.923
     She's not like that, Mom.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.926
               She's innocent.

55:30.928 --> 55:32.995
Yeah, well, she don't
look innocent.

55:46.444 --> 55:48.177
    I miss you so much, sis.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.017
           It's okay.

55:55.686 --> 56:01.256
      Just make this
      a night to remember,
      for the both of us.

56:02.293 --> 56:03.926
        [car horn honks]

56:04.962 --> 56:06.628

56:06.630 --> 56:09.198
            [shrieks]

56:28.419 --> 56:29.451
                         Damn.

56:30.020 --> 56:33.956
    You look... <i> caliente.</i>

56:34.658 --> 56:36.058
       What is that?

56:37.728 --> 56:39.928
Seriously? This is our
last homecoming.

56:39.930 --> 56:42.064
       For once, I wanted
       to ride in style.

56:42.700 --> 56:45.200
   Girl, you lucky we ain't
   takin' the Metro. Come on.

56:45.202 --> 56:48.237
[speaking Spanish
under her breath]

56:52.510 --> 56:56.178
       [speaking Spanish]

57:01.352 --> 57:02.885
 [Eddie]
 All right, let's get it, baby.

57:02.887 --> 57:05.087
       Oh, shut up. Jesus!

57:05.089 --> 57:06.855
              [Eddie]
              So it's gonna be
              like that, today?

57:15.065 --> 57:17.599
Gimme that money! [laughs]
            [screams]

57:17.601 --> 57:18.934
       I got you! [laughs]

57:18.936 --> 57:24.807
    Boy, get your dusty-ass
    fingers off my car.
    I work two jobs for this!

57:24.809 --> 57:25.874
All right.

57:26.544 --> 57:28.911
     I thought I was coming
     to get you.

57:28.913 --> 57:31.947
  I decided to save you
  the extra trouble of driving
  up in them bougie-ass hills

57:31.949 --> 57:35.150
      [sighs] It's like
      you're ashamed of living
      in Baldwin Hills.

57:35.152 --> 57:37.252
    Well, living in the hills
    is overrated.

57:37.254 --> 57:40.122
  Besides, how am I gonna keep
  my street cred if I don't
  walk these streets?

57:40.124 --> 57:42.491
  These streets are overrated.

57:43.727 --> 57:46.495
        Don't you think you're
        a little underdressed
        for the dance tonight?

57:46.730 --> 57:48.797
 What? I thought we was gettin'
 rowdy tonight.

57:49.233 --> 57:53.202
   Although, for real, though,
uh, you look lit.

57:53.671 --> 57:55.471
[chuckles]
             Thanks.

57:58.909 --> 58:00.642
    Now let's go get gangsta.

58:01.078 --> 58:03.011
           Damn, Gina!

58:05.416 --> 58:06.548
    [grunts]

58:06.550 --> 58:11.186
Ooh, look at them, Chauncey,
goin' to their
homecoming dance.

58:11.455 --> 58:15.924
This is your homecoming too.
Come on, let's celebrate.

58:17.495 --> 58:21.029
[scoffs] Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?

58:23.767 --> 58:26.502
[chattering on TV]

58:29.940 --> 58:32.407
         [music playing]

58:38.048 --> 58:40.215
     Come on, now, Chauncey.

58:42.653 --> 58:46.755
Give your mama one dance.
We gonna celebrate.
Come on, boy.

58:47.558 --> 58:52.194
What's wrong with you?
What, you too good
to dance with your mama?

58:56.066 --> 58:57.900
What, you judgin' me?

58:59.136 --> 59:01.970
 [sighs] You think I'm a drunk?

59:03.374 --> 59:07.142
       Oh, you mumble-mouth
       muthafucka!

59:07.144 --> 59:09.411
You ain't never
gonna be shit!

59:11.582 --> 59:14.550
[grunts] Kill me!

59:16.253 --> 59:18.453
        Kill me like you
        killed that girl!

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.667
            Where you going
            tonight, Chauncey?

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:53.248
        Don't speak right now.
           Come on.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.750
Seriously, we came in that?

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:57.386
            [chattering]

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.254
                Hey.
                           Hi.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.156
         Oh, you look so good!

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:03.358
          Look at you!

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.292
You look beautiful.
          [Tiffany] Thank you.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.862
              -Hey!
              -Hey!

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:10.098
       [gasps] Unique! Yo!

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.602
   "Hoochie Love" is my joint.
   All right, I got that on
   repeat, homie.

01:01:13.604 --> 01:01:15.671
            I thought you said
            he was corny.

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:19.908
        [softly] Shut up!

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.611
     Where's Ronny?
     I thought he was
     supposed to come with us.

01:01:22.613 --> 01:01:25.047
Man, Ronny probably
still drunk from
last night's drinking.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:28.517
     Wait, what? No, he said
     he was gonna meet me
     at the dance.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.385
   What?

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.622
            Uh... No.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:40.529
Uh... I meant, meet us,
meet us here at the dance.

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:43.899
Fuck Ronny!
I hope Chauncey catches
his ass on the street.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:45.400
                        Eddie!
       What's up with you?

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:47.235
I don't want to get caught up
in no hood drama, okay?

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:49.838
      Why don't we take a walk
      in the park before
      the dance, okay?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.239
Ah, hell no!

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:54.643
I wanna roll in
the dance with...
[softly] my boy Unique.

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:57.245
Unique is my date,
not yours, Boo. Calm down.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.381
       [Tiffany] Babe, we need
       some private time.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:04.886
  Oh. Private time?
                       Mm-hmm.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:08.523
I'm gonna catch you guys,
uh, later.
[softly] Come on.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.393
 [Lisa] Just make sure you guys
 get back before they announce
 the king and queen,

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.995
     'cause, um, I really need
     my crew for support.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.364
           Girl, you know
           I wouldn't miss it.
      We got you.

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:20.368
     Do you? We're going in.

the homecoming game

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.993
if he hadn't have injured
himself at halftime.

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:20.040
    Stop it!
    I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:23.878
He didn't mean it! He didn't!

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:27.948
  He didn't mean it! [sobbing]

01:21:28.985 --> 01:21:32.186
Just lie down, all right?
Don't fight, just lay back.

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:35.556
    Nah, nah. They just
    gotta pay for what they did,
    that's all.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.658
      They gotta pay for
      what they did to my Amani.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.093
        That's-- that's--
It's okay. Calm down.

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:40.828

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:43.530
      You listening to me?
      Do you hear me?

01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:45.833
I'm gonna make 'em pay!
Get your hands off me!

01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:50.070
Let me-- Oh, come on, man!
