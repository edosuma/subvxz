WEBVTT

00:06.100 --> 00:09.900
You don't think I could ever forget the night
we spent together at band camp, do you?

00:09.900 --> 00:11.400
This is kind of my first date.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.800
Yeah, it's kind of my first date, too.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.300
That idiot's falling in love.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.500
I'm pregnant.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.500
Amy, you can't be pregnant.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.100
Maybe we should think about adoption.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.800
Oh, no. Mimsy, thank you for letting me stay with you.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.500
My mom's here. She doesn't know you're not living here.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.600
Adoption is not an option.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.200
My parents gave me birth control pills.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.700
Your parents let you go on the pill?

00:31.700 --> 00:33.600
I'm going to get a job, and when I get a job,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.000
I'm going to proceed with the divorce,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.800
and you are going to be moving.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.200
I don't believe it! The loan went
through! The house is mine!

00:40.200 --> 00:41.600
How much are you thinking about paying me?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.600
Let's go grab dinner and talk.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.900
Here's what the church can offer you.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.200
A job in the daycare center.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.900
You could teach the little kids music,
and they'd pay you for that.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.300
And we can all babysit for you.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.000
You're moving?
I am.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.500
Oh, George, thank you!

00:54.500 --> 00:56.000
I think this is it, Mom.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.500
I'm having the baby.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.700
I think Amy's in labor. Just
meet us at the hospital.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.400
What are you and Ashley not telling me?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.700
Ashley's moving in with me.
The baby's coming.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.100
I think you should be here. He's your son.

01:06.100 --> 01:10.600
I know you better than anyone,
and if you ever need me, call me.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.200
I'm thinking about getting back together with Jack.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.600
I still think you could do better.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.800
You don't get lonely?
I get lonely.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.300
Are you Betty?
Yeah, I'm Betty.

01:20.300 --> 01:23.000
How can making out be so good and sex so bad?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.800
I'm not ready to have sex.
Not till you graduate from med school.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.900
I don't know if I can wait that long.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.100
Howdy, neighbor! Bought the house next door.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.400
You left your wife?
And the boys.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.900
You and my mom... you're not... 
No. Not right now, anyway.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.800
Why don't you name him?
John.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.100
I like "John."

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
I'm tired.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.700
Okay, Amy. Why don't you go back to bed?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.100
I adore you.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.500
And I'm not just saying that because
you slept with me on our first date.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.600
Hi, John. Daddy's here.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.200
I love you.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.300
So, looks like you've got everything under control.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.800
So, do you want to come say good-bye to Mimsy?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.400
We're just hanging out with her and her friend.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.800
Do I want to go over there?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.400
Do you think she could come over here with her friend?

02:38.400 --> 02:41.400
Kind of a mess over here.
Yeah. I know that.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
You want to help me out?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.600
Amy, if I help you out, you'll never
learn to do this on your own.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.800
Then I'll just be a teenage mother enabler.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
Bye.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.400
Oh, and I think Mom adds milk
to the soup, not water.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.700
Thanks. A lot.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.000
All right.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.600
I am just going to...

03:07.300 --> 03:09.200
lay you down right here,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.600
and then I'm going to finish making the soup,

03:11.900 --> 03:15.300
and then give you a bath, and then
read you chapter 27 in World History... 

03:15.300 --> 03:17.800
"The Decline of the Roman Empire."

03:19.300 --> 03:21.500
There you are.
Here I am.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.900
You're late. And I've been
busy doing all this stuff.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.800
And I cooked dinner... soup.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.600
Soup and?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.400
Just soup.
Well, I can go pick something up.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.300
Why? Why would you go pick something up?

03:32.300 --> 03:35.000
Because you, as a new mother, should
be eating more than soup for dinner.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.100
I had a turkey wrap this afternoon after school.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.000
Well, I didn't. I've just had an apple.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That's all I've had since lunch.
Good.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.300
Meaning?
Nothing. Just good.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.900
Look Amy, if you have something to say, why don't you just say it?

03:46.100 --> 03:48.800
I read in this article that when women reach your age,

03:48.800 --> 03:51.000
their metabolism starts slowing down.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.500
Not that yours has slowed down or anything... 

03:54.500 --> 03:57.500
Uh-huh.
But it could at any time, so

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
I thought we'd just have soup.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.300
In case my metabolism comes
to a dead halt tonight?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.100
Mom!
Amy.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.800
What's in the briefcase?
What?

04:16.800 --> 04:18.899
What's in the briefcase?
What's in that brown paper bag?

04:18.899 --> 04:20.700
Who wants to know?
I want to know.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.800
That's not... 
What?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.200
Mom, you're gaining weight.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.700
You're tired all the time.
Your hands and feet are swollen.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.600
You're not...
I don't know.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.200
That's why I have an early
pregnancy test in my briefcase.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.400
Early pregnancy test?
Well, they don't make late pregnancy tests.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.500
I knew it. How could you
be pregnant at your age?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.200
I don't know.
Mom!

04:44.200 --> 04:47.300
Well, I would rather be pregnant
than be fat and eat soup every night.

Well?
Well, I'm not fat.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.400
Whose is it?
That's the first thing you're going to say to me... 

05:22.400 --> 05:24.600
"Whose is it?"
I don't know what to say.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.900
And I want to know whose it is.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.200
Amy, I think I'm going to tell
the father before I tell you.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.500
Oh. Thanks. I thought we were close.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.800
I thought we weren't keeping
secrets from each other anymore.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.900
Mother and daughter bonding.
Two mothers bonding.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.000
Is it Dad's, or is it David's?
Amy.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.100
Come on.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.300
You told Ben before you told me.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.500
In fact, you told everyone before you told me.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.000
Fine. Who's going to tell Mimsy?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.800
Who's going to tell your mother?

05:47.800 --> 05:50.000
She could come back over here any minute.
Yeah. I doubt it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.200
She loves spending time with your father.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.800
Besides, I'm going to tell Mimsy
when I'm ready to tell Mimsy.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.900
See? Now you know where I was coming from.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.300
Don't you like my new house?

06:06.300 --> 06:07.800
Oh, I do.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.100
The only thing that's missing is Anne. Poor Anne.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.700
Well, she's either pregnant, or she's fat.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.300
She was never this fat when she was pregnant.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.000
She's 57 years old. She can't be pregnant.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.900
Anne? She's not even 40.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.800
You don't believe that, do you?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.500
I did.
No.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.800
I remember when I had her.
It was right after World War II.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.500
Fred and I were in such high spirits.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900
The whole world was.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.500
Well, except for maybe Germany.
And I remember I said to Fred,

06:36.500 --> 06:39.300
"Let's usher in the new year with a bang."

06:40.200 --> 06:41.100
And we did.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.200
What year was that?
1951.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.400
That's a few years after World War II.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
Yeah. You bet.

06:48.900 --> 06:53.400
I remember it was much more fun trying to
have a child than actually having a child.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.200
Oh, that Anne.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.900
Oh, she was so difficult.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.500
Well, you know that.
I sure do, Mimsy.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.400
That's why you've always been my favorite.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.000
Oh, not that it wasn't nice being
over there with the three of them.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.900
It was really nice. But it's much nicer being over here.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
What makes you think she's pregnant and not just fat?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.200
She's... stacked.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.400
She's always been stacked. Yeah, she takes after me.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.500
but Except that I'm thinner, of course.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.800
But, you know, I don't like the way... it's not nice.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.400
It's just not nice the way she
lets everything hang out that way.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.900
And Amy... you really should speak to her.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.700
You really should speak to both of them.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.900
They're sending out the wrong message.
You know, they both could get pregnant again.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.300
I think I might mind my own beeswax with that one.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.200
That's more your area.
Okay.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.500
We'd better be getting home, Mims.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.700
Oh, yes, indeed.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.100
I don't want to be late getting in bed.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.700
You do mean that you don't
want to be late getting home, right?

07:51.900 --> 07:53.400
What's your problem?

07:53.400 --> 07:56.700
I'm having some fun. I'm allowed to have some fun.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.100
Good night. Nice meeting you.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.100
Good night.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.100
Good night, all.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.200
Okay, what's going on?

08:04.300 --> 08:06.000
I mean, that guy's just the driver, isn't he?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.200
I don't know.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.400
But I think you might've just lost your inheritance.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.100
You hungry?
Depends. Where do you want to eat tonight?

08:12.100 --> 08:13.800
Depends. What time you got
to be up for school tomorrow?

08:13.800 --> 08:18.000
Well, if I go, I guess the same time
that I've been getting up for eight years.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.100
Got it.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
I don't know. I want him to be happy.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.500
And I don't mind if my dad dates.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.900
It's just that she's nothing like my mother.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.000
Would you want her to be?
I like her.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.299
I like her, but I just don't
see her has stepmother material.

08:33.299 --> 08:36.200
You're too old to have a stepmother.
She's not going to be your stepmother.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.200
She's going to be your father's new wife.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.400
I think you're both a little ahead of the game here.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.799
They've just been going out for a few weeks.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.900
Still, he's never dated before.

08:43.900 --> 08:48.300
And if he has, he's never introduced me
to anyone before, so this could be serious.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.000
I know it's serious.
I like her.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.300
I'm not saying I don't like her. She just... 

08:53.700 --> 08:55.900
She makes me uncomfortable, for some reason.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.100
Maybe it's her breasts. They're huge.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.500
Doesn't make me uncomfortable.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.400
So you said. But why do you like her?
Just 'cause she has huge breasts?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.600
No.
Then what do you like about her?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.100
I like her brain, too.
Right.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.100
A woman can't be smart and have big breasts?

09:09.100 --> 09:12.600
Of course she can. But I don't think
this woman is particularly smart,

09:12.600 --> 09:14.800
and I don't think you like her for her brain, Henry.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.800
Have it your way. I still like her.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.100
What do you like about me, Henry?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.700
Well, not your breasts.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.900
I had to do it.
That wasn't funny.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.000
Oh, come on.
Henry.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.500
What? Don't you like Amy with bigger breasts?

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
Oh, God.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.200
She has bigger breasts.
I hate that you've noticed.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.800
It's not just me. Everyone's noticed. She's hot.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.400
She's not hot. I mean, she's always been hot.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.100
Now she's hotter, really.
She's nursing.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.900
I don't care what she's doing. It's working for her.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.400
When did you become obsessed with breasts?

09:47.400 --> 09:49.100
And don't talk about my wife like that.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.800
Everyone's talking about her like that.
She's the talk of the school.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.300
Go home, Henry. Just go home.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.700
Why? What'd I do?

09:54.700 --> 09:56.800
And don't hate me because I'm sexually active.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.200
One day, you, too, will have sex
with your girlfriend... or wife.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.800
All right. Good night.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.900
Breasts.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.700
Oh...

10:12.600 --> 10:15.600
Well, I loved meeting Ben and his little friends.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.000
They're nice kids.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.700
Yeah. Especially Ben.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.900
I hope he liked me.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.900
I don't care. I like you, and you like me,

10:24.900 --> 10:27.800
and that's all that matters.
That's all that matters.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.400
To me.
To you.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
You are one of a kind, Betty.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.200
So, tell me how you got into the sausage business.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.700
I love meat.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.600
What's to tell?
Tell me how you became The Sausage King.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.600
It's a long story. You don't want to hear that.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.700
And, besides, every date, we talk about me.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.600
Somehow you turn every conversation back to me.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.700
Let's talk about you for a change.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.500
How did you become a court reporter?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.900
I just have very good fingers.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.800
You know, that's a really nice, uh... 

11:08.100 --> 11:09.300
What do you call it?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.900
Blouse?
Breasts.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.500
I wasn't looking at your breasts.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.700
Really? I bought this blouse just so you would.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.600
You don't have to seduce me.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.600
I'm as attracted to you now as I was in high school.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.400
Well, we're not in high school anymore,

11:23.400 --> 11:25.800
and life has gotten a lot more complicated.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.200
Our lives were pretty complicated in high school.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
I should've married you.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
But it wouldn't have lasted.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.800
You would've felt trapped.
Maybe.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.200
But we're not in high school now.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.500
And I can't marry you now.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.400
I'm still married.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.900
I don't want to interrupt your evening, but

11:48.900 --> 11:50.300
I have a test tomorrow.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.400
The walls are thin. I can hear everything you're saying.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.500
And not that it's any of my business,

11:55.500 --> 11:58.100
but, um, if you two aren't going to get married,

11:58.400 --> 12:00.600
maybe you should just move in together.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.800
She is a smart girl.
Very smart girl.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.900
But not as smart as her mother.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.600
Hi, Ricky. I'm studying.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.700
I'm going over to see John.
Then I thought maybe I'd drop by.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.800
Ruben's here. Again.
Again?

12:27.800 --> 12:30.900
You know what? You should just
get emancipated and get your own place.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.200
You're all grown up now.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.900
You're a father. You need a place.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.900
I had a place. Then you got your mother
back together with your father,

12:36.900 --> 12:38.400
and now neither of us have a place.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.300
If they decide to move in together,

12:40.300 --> 12:43.400
maybe they'll let me stay here
until the real estate market goes back up,

12:43.400 --> 12:44.900
and then we can be alone again.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.000
Okay. One, I doubt they'd let you do that,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.800
and two, unless the real estate
market goes up by 11:00 tonight,

12:50.800 --> 12:52.200
it's not going to do me much good.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.900
Oh, hold on. I have another call. Hang on.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.300
I'll call you later.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.100
Hello, Grace.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.200
I hope this is important. I was talking to Ricky.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.500
It is important.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.800
Jack and I are having sex for the first time.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.900
And you're calling me right in the middle
of having sex for the first time?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.700
No. I mean tonight.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.500
Tonight is the night!

13:11.600 --> 13:13.000
I just thought I'd call and let you know.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.100
Okay. Do you have any last-minute advice?

13:15.100 --> 13:17.100
Yeah. Don't do it.

13:17.200 --> 13:17.800
What?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.800
Don't do it.
Why not?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.900
Because once you do it, it's over.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.000
That's it. And there's only one first time.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.900
And I know you, Grace.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.500
You're not ready to have sex.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.900
Yes, I am. I've been on the pill for a month,

13:30.900 --> 13:33.600
and he's also going to use a condom. And...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.300
we're ready.
No, you're not.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.800
You are not ready. You're prepared.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.700
You have the birth control to protect you,

13:40.700 --> 13:44.200
but you're not mentally or emotionally ready for this.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.800
Yes, I am. I've been praying about it for a long time,

13:46.800 --> 13:50.900
and I know, in my heart, that it's perfectly
okay for me to express my love for Jack.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.300
There are other ways to express your love.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.700
You have sex. Why shouldn't I have sex?

13:55.700 --> 13:57.800
Because I'm me, and you're you.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.200
I thought you'd be happy for me.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.400
No, I'm not happy for you.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.800
Fine. Thanks for being my friend.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.000
I am your friend.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.600
Or, I'm trying to be your friend, anyway.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.700
Then just tell me you're happy for me.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.200
Hi. I'm here.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
They're in there.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.700
I hear. What's little John so upset about?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.600
I don't know. What's in the bag?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
Brought you girls something to eat.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.300
I was grilling steaks for my family tonight, so...

14:31.300 --> 14:33.600
Baked potato in there, too, with bacon bits.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.900
Thank you. All I've had is soup.

14:35.900 --> 14:36.900
You're welcome.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.700
Can you believe it? The second
he touches him, he stops crying.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.000
Makes me crazy.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
Well, maybe if you weren't so upset,
John wouldn't be so upset.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.900
You're hardly in a position
to give me advice, don't you think?

14:53.900 --> 14:55.900
Yeah, I do think. I'm still your mother.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.200
How did this happen, Mom?

14:57.200 --> 15:00.200
I don't understand how this
could happen, especially at your age.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.000
Wow.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
David's going to fire you when
he finds out you're pregnant.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.900
David is my boyfriend.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.300
He's not my boss.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.700
I'm a consultant to David's firm
as well as to other firms yet to be found.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.000
And even if David were just
my boss and not my boyfriend,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.200
he couldn't fire me just because I'm pregnant.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.900
So, as a consultant, do you have insurance?

15:16.900 --> 15:19.600
Yeah, I do have insurance. I
have insurance with your dad.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.100
And how long is that going to last when he
finds out you're having someone else's baby?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.500
Are you sure you're not just going
through menopause or something?

15:25.500 --> 15:27.100
Would that throw off the pregnancy test?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.400
I love you, Amy,

15:28.400 --> 15:30.700
but mind your own teenage business, all right?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.500
Is that meat?

15:35.700 --> 15:37.100
Do I smell meat?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.400
Mom! Did Ricky bring you that?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.200
Us! He brought it for us.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.700
I told him I made you soup.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.900
Well, soup is not enough, Amy. I'm pregnant.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.100
Wow.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.600
That's great.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.000
Congratulations.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.000
I guess.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.400
Love you.
Love you.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.700
I'm... I'm not going to answer that.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.400
Are you expecting someone?
Kind of.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.100
You didn't lock the front door?

16:19.100 --> 16:20.700
You think you're ready to have sex with a guy,

16:20.700 --> 16:23.400
and you're not even careful
enough to lock the front door?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
Hi, Adrian.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.800
You told her?

16:29.400 --> 16:30.700
Thanks, Adrian.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.600
I thought we weren't going to tell anyone.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.700
Can I talk to you?

16:35.700 --> 16:37.400
I think you already talked to her, didn't you?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.300
Just give me a minute, please.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.800
Grace, I think it's the two of us who need a minute.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.900
Adrian, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.400
Ask all you want. I'm not leaving.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.800
Adrian, you're ruining this very special night for me.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.700
For us.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.800
You're completely and totally ruining everything.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.600
Good. As your best friend, that's my job.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.700
Why don't you two best friends talk to each other?

17:00.700 --> 17:02.100
I think I'll go.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.800
This probably wasn't a good idea anyway.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.599
The timing didn't feel right.
The timing didn't feel right?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.300
We've been talking about doing this all year.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.700
Yeah, I know.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.700
But it just isn't the right time.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.500
For me, anyway.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.400
All right. I'll talk to you later, Grace.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.300
You make me so angry, I want to spit!

17:28.300 --> 17:30.700
Better than being so angry,
you have sex before you're ready.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.400
I am ready!
I know why you're doing this.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.700
Because your parents told you
they don't want you to do this.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.600
No. My dad doesn't want me to do this.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.400
My mom doesn't want me to do it, either, but...

17:39.700 --> 17:41.300
She's a woman. She understands.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.600
I don't understand. You're a Christian.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.000
You're supposed to wait until you get married.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.200
I can be Christian and have sex before I get married.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.000
I'm in a committed relationship. I'm in love.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.800
And one day, I am going to marry Jack.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.200
This is the only guy you've ever really dated.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.700
Hello! Ricky.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.000
What about Ricky?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.700
You never really dated him.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.000
You've never dated anyone but Jack.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.500
Fine. Going with that logic,
I've never dated anyone but Jack,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.100
and I never will.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.900
Adrian, this is between Jack and me,

18:12.100 --> 18:13.300
not you and me,

18:13.300 --> 18:14.800
and Jack and I are okay with this.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.900
Of course he's okay with it. He's a guy.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.800
All guys are okay with it.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Look... listen to me, Grace.

18:22.100 --> 18:27.400
You are a good example for every girl
who wants to wait to have sex until she's married.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.600
I'm not a poster girl for virginity, okay?

18:29.600 --> 18:33.100
I'm not some spokeswoman
for abstinence. I'm just me.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.300
And I understand these life choices,

18:35.300 --> 18:38.400
and I have been a proponent of waiting until marriage.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.200
However, I can no longer wait.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.900
Because?
Because I need sex.

18:43.900 --> 18:44.800
Ohh!

18:44.800 --> 18:47.800
I want sex. I feel like having sex!

18:47.800 --> 18:50.900
And you know what, Adrian?
Those feelings come from love.

18:50.900 --> 18:55.300
And God is love. And I feel sure that God
is okay with my making love to Jack.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.700
But why are you in such a hurry?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.300
I'm not in a hurry.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.100
We've been thinking about having
sex for the whole school year.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.700
Jack's been doing more than thinking about it.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.200
He's been having sex for the whole school year.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
Not with me.
I get it now.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.600
If you have sex with Jack, you think
he won't have sex with anyone else.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.900
He won't.
He might.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.000
I've been reading a lot lately, and...

19:20.000 --> 19:21.100
He won't.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.400
I'm sure that once he and I are together,
he's never going to go anywhere else.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.600
Grace, sex is not a competition.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.900
You can't keep Jack just by having sex with him.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
My God, is that a hooker he's with?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.700
I doubt it. He told me he had a girlfriend.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.000
Come on.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.200
Hey, Leo.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.100
Hey. Hi there.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.000
Hi, Leo.
Hi, Ashley, George.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.800
I'd like you to meet my friend. Uh, this is Betty.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.800
Betty, this is Ashley and George, Amy's sister and dad.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.300
Pleased to meet you.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.300
I heard all about your little Amy.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.000
How is the baby?

20:04.000 --> 20:04.900
Huh?

20:05.800 --> 20:08.200
The baby is fine. John.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.400
John? What John?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.000
The baby. His name's John.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.500
Oh, right. I knew that.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.900
Ben sent me a text.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.400
He's going over to say good night to them.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.200
He's over there every time Ricky's over there.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.500
Hey, it's a tough situation for my boy.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.900
You two like to join us?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.500
Oh, we wouldn't dream of it.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.900
You enjoy yourselves. Nice meeting you, Betty.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.400
I wish I could meet a girl like that.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.300
I don't think it would be too difficult.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.200
There's probably one on every street corner.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.600
The man's been widowed for five years.
Why shouldn't he go out on a date?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.100
Well, there's dating, and then there's dating.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.800
What makes you think she's a hooker?
She's got "hooker"

20:46.800 --> 20:48.900
written all over her.
No, she doesn't.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.100
You don't know anything about hookers, I hope.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.300
Look who just came in. The joint's a-jumping.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.100
Jesus, Roark.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.300
It's David.
The Fountainhead.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.300
I knew that.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.500
Let's invite him to eat with us.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.100
No. I hate that guy.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.500
I don't. I think he's great.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.600
You only think he's great
if he's the father of the baby.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.300
He's the father.
You hope.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.700
No, I know.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.200
I'll be right back. Order anything you want.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.500
Hey, look who's here.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.300
Oh. George. Hi.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.100
So, is Anne meeting you here, or are you drinking alone?

21:22.100 --> 21:23.500
You know I come here.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.400
And, no, Anne is not joining me tonight.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.400
She said Mimsy was in town and that
she was tired and wanted to go home.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.900
Well, Mimsy left, and I bet Ann
was tired and wanted to go home.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.600
Probably wanted to get that weight off her feet, huh?

21:34.600 --> 21:37.300
I beg your pardon?
Come on. She's gained weight.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.200
A lot of weight.
Who?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.900
"Who." Your girlfriend, my soon-to-be ex-wife, Anne.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.400
I'm not going to discuss Anne's weight with you.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.800
I'm not even going to discuss Anne with you.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.300
Hey, hey, don't get upset.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.200
I'm just reaching out to you in your time of need.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.400
"Time of need"?
You know what I'm talking about.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.700
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.900
Are you and Anne expecting?
"Expecting?"

21:55.900 --> 21:58.000
It's like talking to a brick wall. Hey, that's kind of funny.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.700
You being an architect and all. "Brick wall."

21:59.700 --> 22:01.800
I got it, George.
And yet you don't got it.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
Anne's pregnant.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.700
Congratulations.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.100
Scotch. Something fancy and old. Straight up.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.900
That about right?

22:09.900 --> 22:11.000
Maybe.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
I got to get back to my daughter.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.500
But that Anne... she makes beautiful babies.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.100
Wait, wait. Did Anne tell you that she and I are pregnant?

22:18.100 --> 22:20.200
No, but I'm not stupid. I know she's pregnant.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.400
I've seen her pregnant before.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.700
Any possibility that she's pregnant with your baby?

22:25.000 --> 22:25.900
Nope.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.700
Enjoy your drink.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.400
I just... I had to come by and
say good night to you and John, so...

23:03.700 --> 23:04.600
Wow.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.200
Uh, Ricky's in my room with John.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.300
Think you might be moving him into the nursery soon?

23:11.300 --> 23:14.000
Uh, John, the baby, not Ricky.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.800
I don't know. You know, he still
wakes up in the middle of the night,

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
and it's so much easier just to reach over and pick him up.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.000
Why?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.200
I'm just... I'm not that comfortable with
Ricky hanging out in your room all the time.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.300
What?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
Ben, he's not in there for me, he's in there for John.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.100
Okay.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.500
You want some soup?

23:31.700 --> 23:33.200
There's leftover soup from dinner.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.700
Soup? I thought I smelled steak.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.700
Yeah. Ricky brought over a steak for my mom...and me.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.300
Oh, did he?

23:41.300 --> 23:44.300
Was it rib eye? He bought rib eyes at the shop today.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
I should've known he was trying to suck up to your mother.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.900
Why would he be sucking up to my mother?

23:48.900 --> 23:51.300
Oh, I don't know. So he can get closer to you.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.300
Jeez. Really, Ben? What is going on with you?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.000
You've never been this jealous
before. I don't know if I like it.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.000
What are you staring at?
Nothing.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.400
I know what you were looking at.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.000
Well, it's not exactly as if you're
trying to hide anything lately.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.900
Excuse me?
I think we should talk.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
Before anybody gets really upset here,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.600
let's just talk about this.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.200
About... this?

24:15.200 --> 24:16.400
I want to have sex.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.900
I guess I showed up at a bad time.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.900
I just wanted to say good night.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.700
Amy, Ben, night.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.800
I just had a baby.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.200
Hey. Thanks for coming over.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.300
You're so good with him... with John.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.100
No problem.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.600
I can stay over, if you want,
and take care of him all night

24:42.600 --> 24:44.000
so you can get some sleep.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.400
I can sleep on that chair in your room.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.800
No. It's okay.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.800
He should be all right now. At least for a few hours.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.000
And, besides, if anybody's going to
sleep in Amy's room, it's going to be me.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.500
Should I tell your driver? I think he's waiting for you.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.600
I'm in driver's ed, you know. I'll be driving soon.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.100
Yeah, if you can pass the test.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.400
Will the two of you just leave, please?

25:01.700 --> 25:04.300
You can sort this out at the butcher
shop tomorrow on your own time.

25:20.700 --> 25:24.100
Oh, no! How does he know when he leaves?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
Did Ricky leave?
Obviously.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.400
Hello.
Hey, sweetie.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.100
Hi.
Hi.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.700
What's going on?
Nothing.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.600
Or everything. Can I come over?

25:43.600 --> 25:45.400
Well, I'm already ready for bed and,

25:45.600 --> 25:47.100
besides, I'll see you tomorrow at work.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.400
I don't know if this can wait for work.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.600
Are you pregnant?
Are you drunk?

25:51.600 --> 25:52.700
I asked you first.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.500
Well, we'll talk about it when you're not drunk.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.200
Is that a yes?
Where are you?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.200
Do you want me to call you a taxi?

25:57.200 --> 26:00.400
No. I can get a ride home from George.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.800
Why they all flying on that little jet?

26:21.100 --> 26:24.000
Why they don't fly on a big jet?

26:24.100 --> 26:25.900
They're doctors.

26:25.900 --> 26:30.200
They can afford a big jet and a big airport.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.500
Well, that's Dr. Sigay's private jet.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.300
He owns it, and he's a pilot.

26:34.300 --> 26:37.800
It doesn't seem right to fly

26:37.800 --> 26:41.800
to a Third World country on a private jet.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.700
Tom.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.400
All right. I should've stayed home.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.200
Why didn't you?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.700
I don't want to be there when

26:47.900 --> 26:51.600
Grace has sex with Jack.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.800
Grace is not going to have sex with Jack.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.900
She's not ready to have sex with Jack.

26:55.900 --> 26:59.800
I don't think that matters anymore.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
She's just going to do it

27:02.600 --> 27:06.600
because she wants to do it.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.800
Tom?
Hi, honey. It's me.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.500
We just got your dad on the plane.
I wanted to see how you are.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
I'm fine. When are you coming home?

27:19.500 --> 27:22.000
It's about a two-hour drive,
but Tom and I haven't eaten yet,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.600
so we'll probably stop on the way.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.300
You doing okay there?
Mm-hmm. I'm fine here.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.200
Grace, they haven't taken off yet,

27:28.700 --> 27:29.700
if you want to give your dad a call.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.400
I do not want to give him a call.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.900
Stop trying to make me apologize to him.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.400
Why can't we just have a
difference of opinion like two adults?

27:36.400 --> 27:39.000
Because you're not an adult, and he's your father.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.100
And, for some reason, you suddenly
have no respect for his opinion.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.700
I respect his opinion.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.100
It's just my life.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.500
I just don't like that he's going away on a long trip,

27:47.500 --> 27:49.100
and the two of you are at odds with each other.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.500
He thinks I'm a child. He's treating me like a child.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.400
He's not treating you like a child

27:53.400 --> 27:56.800
because he's suggesting that you wait
a while longer before you and Jack... 

27:56.800 --> 27:58.200
Do it!

27:59.400 --> 28:01.100
I'll talk to him when he gets back.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.500
I'll be older when he gets back.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.400
A whole week older.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.100
You are being very stubborn, Grace.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.200
So is he.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.800
He doesn't get to make this decision for me.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.300
We'll be home around midnight.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.500
Don't wait up. It's a school night.
All right.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.700
Love you, Mom.
I love you, Grace.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.800
Me, too.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.700
You sure about this?

28:23.300 --> 28:24.400
I'm sure.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.800
I'm absolutely sure.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.000
In sports, the National Hockey League

28:37.000 --> 28:38.300
featured a busy five... 

28:44.600 --> 28:45.500
Hi.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.800
My cell phone battery's dead. I just thought I could... 

28:47.800 --> 28:49.800
Plug it in here?
All right.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.500
Just tell Adrian I came by, if you don't mind.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.000
No, I don't mind.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.600
But, uh, why don't you come in and wait for her?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.300
Oh, I don't think so.
I said come in...

29:01.600 --> 29:03.100
and wait for her.

29:09.100 --> 29:09.900
Sit down.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.900
Maybe I should go.
Or maybe we should talk.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.100
All right. What do you want to talk about?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.200
How's John?
He's okay.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.900
He doesn't sleep through the night yet,

29:23.900 --> 29:26.400
but that's to be expected with a boy at his age.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.400
He'll get there.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.900
Not before Amy loses her mind, but he'll get there.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.500
And how are you doing with balancing school,

29:34.600 --> 29:36.900
a job, going over to take care of him?

29:36.900 --> 29:37.800
It's almost the end of the year.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.400
My grades may have slipped a little,

29:39.400 --> 29:41.300
but not enough to wreck my averages.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.200
And the job's great. I love that job.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.100
Working at the butcher shop?
Yeah.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.200
What do you love about it?
I'm doing something that's useful to someone,

29:49.200 --> 29:50.700
and I'm making some money.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.700
Any further questions, Your Honor?

29:54.500 --> 29:55.900
Hey, I'm just making small talk.
Why?

29:57.600 --> 29:58.500
Why not?

29:58.500 --> 30:00.100
You're sleeping with my daughter.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.000
Maybe we should get to know each other.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.300
Unless, of course, you don't intend to
be with Adrian the rest of your life.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.700
In which case, you shouldn't be sleeping with her.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.700
What's going on?

30:14.200 --> 30:17.300
I was at the library 'cause I thought you'd
still be here, arguing with my mother.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.200
Nothing's going on, so I'll be leaving now.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.600
Ruben.
Adrian.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.800
Don't you have to go home?
Back to my hotel room? No.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.800
I might even sleep on the couch.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.500
Fine. Ricky and I are going to talk in my room.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.400
How long have you been here?

30:39.900 --> 30:42.300
Long enough to become uninterested in having sex.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.800
Oh, we can still have sex. He knows we have sex.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.000
I'm not having sex with you while your
father's sitting on your living room couch.

30:48.100 --> 30:50.500
I'll make you forget that.
No, you can't.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
I can.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.100
I'm going to go, okay? Maybe tomorrow night.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.900
Bye.
Bye.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.400
So you're not going to have sex tonight?

31:05.200 --> 31:06.500
I hope it wasn't something I said.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.700
What are you doing here, anyway?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.400
That would be your business?
I could say the same to you.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.300
You haven't been around for 16 years,

31:12.300 --> 31:14.700
and now it's your business if I'm here with Adrian.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.800
I've known her longer than you have.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.100
I know more about her than you do.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.798
Yeah, I may have gotten a girl pregnant
that I didn't want to marry,

31:22.798 --> 31:24.000
but I'm there for my kid.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.300
Hey, Cindy wanted to get pregnant.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.000
She wanted to trap me.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.500
And then when I offered to marry her,
she didn't want to get married.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.900
She didn't even let me know when Adrian was born.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.100
I see.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.700
You offered to marry her,

31:35.700 --> 31:39.200
and she missed out because she
didn't take you up on your offer.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.600
I'm sure the offer must've made her feel very special.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.600
Or it made her feel so insignificant

31:47.600 --> 31:51.000
and out of control, she just refused
to have anything to do with you.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.300
Is that what she said?
What?

31:54.200 --> 31:55.500
No. That's what I said.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.200
I happen to know a little something about women.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.300
They don't want an offer.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.700
They want to be loved. And you do, too.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.800
You walked out on the best thing you could've had,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
and you went looking for it over and over and over again.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.000
Don't you come over here and hurt Adrian again,

32:15.200 --> 32:18.400
because you've already hurt her enough
by not being around her whole life.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.500
Good night.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.700
You should've just gone back to your hotel
room so I could have sex with my boyfriend,

32:30.200 --> 32:33.100
'cause you're never going to be able
to get what he just said out of your head.

32:36.700 --> 32:37.800
Ben?

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
You awake?

32:42.100 --> 32:43.100
No.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.800
Well, wake up. I want to tell you something.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.800
What?
I'm in love.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.000
Dad.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.400
I am. I'm in love with Betty.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.100
I just want you to know that.
And I have to know that now?

32:55.100 --> 32:58.900
Yes. I wanted to tell you now so that when
you run into Betty at the breakfast table,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.700
it won't be quite so awkward.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.200
Oh, Dad...

33:02.400 --> 33:03.700
isn't it a little soon?

33:03.700 --> 33:05.500
I haven't been with a woman in...

33:07.000 --> 33:08.200
a long time.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.500
It's not too soon, believe me.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.700
Good night, Ben.
Good night.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.400
What?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.900
Happen to have a condom?

33:23.100 --> 33:25.800
Wow. I'm an optimist.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.500
Me, too.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.200
You gave her the key?
No.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.600
Amy?
Yes.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.000
Dad!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.700
Where have you two been? It's a school night.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.400
Who are you, and what are you doing in my kitchen?

33:52.700 --> 33:53.900
We need to talk.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.300
And, Ashley, you need to go to bed and get some sleep

33:56.300 --> 33:58.300
and not listen to the conversation
I'm about to have with your father,

33:58.300 --> 33:59.900
no matter how loud it gets.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.400
All right.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.400
Can I get you anything?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.900
Sardines and ice cream, perhaps?
I'm not pregnant.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.100
Okay.
And if I am pregnant,

34:09.100 --> 34:11.400
I would let you know, and
I would let my boyfriend know.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.800
I don't need for you to let him know.
Okay.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.699
I'm not pregnant.
You just said that.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.300
Who are you trying to convince?
Me.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.600
Did you not want to get pregnant?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.300
Why would I want to get pregnant?

34:21.699 --> 34:23.000
I just started my life.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Looks to me like you got a little buddy
joining you there, with your new life.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.500
George, there's no chance that... 

34:29.100 --> 34:31.300
You're absolutely sure that
the vasectomy worked, right?

34:31.300 --> 34:33.500
We've been having sex for
10 years since my vasectomy,

34:33.500 --> 34:35.600
and you never got pregnant,
so don't try blaming this one on me.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.300
I just want to make sure.
Are you having unprotected sex with David?

34:38.300 --> 34:41.199
I really don't feel comfortable talking
about my sex life with you.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.500
Yeah, I can imagine.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.400
You want to spend the night?

34:44.400 --> 34:45.900
With you?
No, not with me.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.300
But you can have my bedroom since you're
probably not getting a lot of sleep over there,

34:48.300 --> 34:50.699
and since you're pregnant
and pregnant women need sleep.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.600
Hello.
Hey. Is Mom there?

34:55.600 --> 34:56.300
Yep.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.400
Yes, Amy.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.900
Could you help me get John back to bed?

35:00.900 --> 35:03.200
Every time I put him down, he starts crying again.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.700
No, I can't.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.100
I'm tired. Call Ricky.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.300
It's after midnight.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.900
Yes, it is, Amy, and I need to get some sleep.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.300
So do I, Mom.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.800
I'm coming over.
Thanks, Dad.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.900
How is she supposed to learn anything when
you go and do something crazy like this?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.400
Now I'm supposed to be the good example?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.500
So I can go to sleep in your room?
Anytime.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.400
I knew you were pregnant. You got that glow thing.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.100
Congratulations. Are you happy?

35:29.100 --> 35:30.100
I guess.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.900
Happiness is overrated, anyway.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.100
Does Ashley know?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.700
Afraid so.
How could everyone know but me?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.500
Denial?
It doesn't make sense.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.900
David and I were careful.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.200
Very careful. Doubly careful.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.300
Things happen.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.500
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.800
You sure? You look a little disappointed.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.900
No.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.800
I'm just exhausted.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.100
It took a lot of energy.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.100
I had no idea it would be like that.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.300
Yeah, I didn't either.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.800
I didn't expect you to be quite so...aggressive.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.000
Yeah.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.500
I... I don't know. I...

36:20.700 --> 36:23.000
I thought it might be embarrassing or

36:23.000 --> 36:24.100
hurt or something, but...

36:24.100 --> 36:25.600
I don't... I don't know. Once...

36:26.500 --> 36:28.000
Once we got going,

36:28.900 --> 36:30.400
and I got over my fear,

36:31.500 --> 36:32.500
I liked it...

36:33.300 --> 36:34.600
a lot.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.300
I wish we had time to do it again.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.800
Really?
Yeah.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.200
I feel... I don't know... 

36:41.500 --> 36:42.900
like, set free or something.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.400
Really?
Yeah.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.100
Jack, you were great.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.600
I was kind of jealous that
you've been with other women,

36:49.600 --> 36:52.400
but maybe it worked to my benefit,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.700
'cause you made me feel totally comfortable,

36:56.600 --> 36:59.200
and you were quite sensitive to my needs,

36:59.900 --> 37:00.900
and skillful.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.100
Thank you, Grace.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.400
And, um, how do you feel emotionally?

37:04.600 --> 37:07.100
I hate to run out and leave you alone.
Emotionally?

37:07.300 --> 37:09.200
I feel stronger than I ever have.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.900
I feel satisfied.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.400
I feel no shame.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
It's a natural and beautiful thing.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.600
And it's fun, too.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.000
You make me so happy.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.400
No, you make me so happy.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.400
I love you.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.300
I love sex.
All right!

37:32.400 --> 37:34.700
Well, as soon as we're of
legal age, let's get married.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.400
'Cause I would love to marry
a woman who loves sex as much.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.900
Good night.
Good night, Grace.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.300
I love you.
I love you, too.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.400
Oh, no.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.500
Jack, where's Grace?

38:02.500 --> 38:04.100
She's upstairs, and she's fine.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.200
He's dead.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.000
What? No, no, no. No one's dead. We just had sex.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.200
What? You had sex?

38:11.200 --> 38:14.800
Jack, Marshall's dead!

38:22.200 --> 38:24.200
Mom, don't cry. I'm fine.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.600
You killed him!

38:29.100 --> 38:30.300
What?

38:51.500 --> 38:54.500
Do I stink? You know, I haven't
showered in 24 hours.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.300
Good morning, little fella.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.400
Wow. Dad, did you do all this?
I was up anyway.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.500
Dad, thank you. I... I really, really appreciate it.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.700
No problem. Is that what
you're wearing to school?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.400
Yes. Is there something wrong with it?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.100
Yes, there's something wrong with it.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
Have you been talking to Ben?
No, I've been talking to Mimsy,

39:16.600 --> 39:19.200
and she thinks you and your mother been
showing off your figures a little too much.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.100
Our figures?
You know what I'm saying.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.600
Cover up, kid. You're a mom now,

39:22.600 --> 39:24.100
and you don't want to be a mom again,

39:24.600 --> 39:26.100
not when your mom's going to be a mom.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.400
She told you?
I knew.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.600
Well, yeah, we all knew. I'm just shocked.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.900
Well, I think your mom's a little shocked, too.

39:32.900 --> 39:36.000
And I don't think this was planned,
so don't make her feel bad.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.900
You owe her.
Yeah, I know that.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.700
I'm trying. I'm trying to do
for her what she did for me,

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
even though I shouldn't have to.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.200
Well, she shouldn't have had to, either.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.100
Ames, your mom is a good woman,

39:46.300 --> 39:47.500
and she's been through a lot.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.800
And I don't know how this
happened, but it doesn't matter.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.900
We're all going to support each other's mistakes,

39:52.200 --> 39:53.600
because that's what a family is.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.200
Apparently our family makes a few
more mistakes than other families... 

39:56.200 --> 39:58.300
not that our little John here was a mistake... 

39:58.400 --> 40:00.800
but you never know what's going to be
good for the world around you and what isn't.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.600
So don't judge her. You got it?
Yeah. I got it.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.200
You do stink.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
I know. I've been up all night with someone's son.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.500
Someone's grandson. Just hold him for another minute.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.700
Let me just grab some breakfast.

40:13.700 --> 40:16.700
Amy, it's baby first. Always baby first.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.500
Cereal. I'm just getting cereal.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.800
It'll take two seconds.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.800
Hello.
George, I have terrible news.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.300
Yeah, I know. You told me last night.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.500
This isn't funny.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.900
Who died?
Someone did die.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.000
Oh, God. It's not Ashley.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.300
No, George.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.200
Hi.
Did you turn on the news this morning?

40:44.300 --> 40:45.200
No.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.500
There was a plane crash.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.700
Oh, God.
No, no. Not your mom.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.100
It's not your mom.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.200
All right. Then who was it?

40:57.600 --> 40:59.200
Please, not another terrorist attack.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.800
No, Adrian.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.800
No. It was a private jet.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.300
Oh, no.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.600
Oh. Good morning.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.100
Morning, Ben. But it's not a good one.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.400
Bad night? Things didn't go well with Betty?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.700
It's not Betty.

41:18.900 --> 41:21.300
Things went fine with Betty.
Then who had a bad night?

41:21.300 --> 41:23.100
Ben, I don't know how to tell you this, but

41:23.700 --> 41:25.000
I just got some sad news.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.200
Not Amy. Dad, please not Amy.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.800
No. Amy and John are fine.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.500
It's okay, Mom.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.000
I'm here for you.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.400
It's okay.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.700
Eat something.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.600
You will feel better.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.000
Thank you, Tom.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.700
But, uh,

41:47.200 --> 41:49.800
I don't think I'm going to feel
better for a very long time.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.700
Dad is in heaven.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.000
He's okay.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.900
He's probably playing golf

41:55.900 --> 41:58.300
with Jesus.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.500
Yeah.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.500
He probably is. He probably is.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.700
I remember when

42:08.300 --> 42:10.200
my birth mom died.

42:10.200 --> 42:14.200
It was a terrible time.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.800
You took care of me,

42:17.000 --> 42:20.900
