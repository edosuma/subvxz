00:01.392 --> 00:02.437
<i>Previously on "Alaska Daily"...</i>

00:02.480 --> 00:03.829
Hey, Eileen,
you got a minute?

00:03.873 --> 00:05.527
- No. On deadline.
- I know.
It's about your source.

00:05.570 --> 00:06.571
Still no.
Still on deadline.

00:06.615 --> 00:07.790
<i>We have a problem.</i>

00:07.833 --> 00:09.748
- Anything from your source?
- He's gone dark.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.316
But if the documents
are fake--It's on them to prove they are.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.101
Complaints have surfaced
about how you treat the staff.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.232
That you're abusive.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.581
They're trying
to cancel me now?

00:16.625 --> 00:17.626
Why are you here,
Stanley?

00:17.669 --> 00:18.714
To offer you a job.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.411
Her name is Gloria Nanmac.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.196
She went missing
two years ago.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.981
I can't go to Alaska,
Stanley. It's ridiculous.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.027
This story can change
the national conversation.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.680
I just don't know
if I'm ready.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.160
<i>I got a strong hunch
you are.</i>

00:30.204 --> 00:32.162
Ms. Fitzgerald?
Welcome to Alaska.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.251
Roz, I want to put you
on a story with Eileen.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.774
Do you know anything
about Alaska?

00:35.818 --> 00:37.863
- Is she always like this?
- Mrs. Nanmac.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.300
I came because our editor
wants to find out

00:39.343 --> 00:40.605
what happened to Gloria.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.519
What do you want
to know?

00:41.563 --> 00:43.173
Gloria used crutches?

00:43.217 --> 00:45.349
She was last seen alive
at the party here,

00:45.393 --> 00:48.004
and her body was found all
the way out here on the tundra.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.223
Someone dropped her off
out there.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.789
We need to talk to this guy,
Toby Crenshaw.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.053
Jordan Teller.
That Jordan Teller.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.880
You have no right
to come to my home.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.230
I know you're just
doing your job,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.624
but if you print it,
it will destroy me, my family.

01:26.956 --> 01:32.309
♪ I am not a woman, I'm a god

01:32.353 --> 01:35.007
♪ I am not a martyr,
I'm a problem ♪

01:35.051 --> 01:37.401

<i>♪ Maybe I could be a better

02:01.512 --> 02:03.471
You gotta be kidding me.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.651
Are moose dangerous?

02:09.694 --> 02:12.306
<i>Moose are not usually
aggressive towards humans</i>

02:12.349 --> 02:14.612
<i>but can be provoked
to behave with aggression.</i>

02:14.656 --> 02:18.486
<i>They attack more people than
bears and wolves combined.</i>

02:18.529 --> 02:20.575
Good enough for me.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.266
Turn that off. Now.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.624
No! Don't.
I'm using it.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.842
You're hogging it.

03:10.886 --> 03:11.974
Shut up, butt wipe!

03:12.017 --> 03:13.628
Pete, be nice.
Share with your brother.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.151
It's his birthday.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.894
Jeff, can you...?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.112
I have to get this piece in
by 10:00.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.723
I-I'm just dealing with
a work thing.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.290
I happen to have a job, too.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.943
Dudes, come on.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.336
Good morning.
Want more coffee?

03:26.380 --> 03:28.077
Please.
Thanks, Rita.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.078
Mm-hmm.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.688
It's Finn's birthday--
9.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.734
Happy birthday, Finn.

03:32.777 --> 03:35.606
Rita's is officially
a Muncy birthday tradition.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.175
I remember your parents coming
in here before you existed.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.699
No, that's not--
that's not what I'm saying.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.093
I'm out of here!

03:44.136 --> 03:46.269
Man #2: Yeah, keep walking!

03:46.313 --> 03:47.662
Whatever, man!

03:48.967 --> 03:51.361
That was pleasant.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.538
Just another angry person.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.584
It's the world
we live in.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.107
And it's only
getting worse.

04:03.721 --> 04:04.940
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

04:04.983 --> 04:07.116
we are gathered for
a very special occasion.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.423
A little tradition
here at <i>The Alaskan.</i>

04:09.466 --> 04:11.468
A token for your first
front-page story.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.340
Thank you, guys.
A lot.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.298
Congrats!

04:15.342 --> 04:18.258
It is also a tradition that,
after receiving said token,

04:18.301 --> 04:20.825
you must buy us all coffee
from the truck.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.174
Definitely not
a tradition.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.393
It could be.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.786
All right,
intrepid reporters,

04:24.829 --> 04:26.701
if I'm not mistaken,
we have a paper to put out.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.311
I do have another story
I'd like to pitch.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.269
My door's always open.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.444
Great job.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.794
Hey.

04:32.837 --> 04:33.882
Yes.

04:33.925 --> 04:37.929
Yuna! Yeah!
Oh, my God!

04:37.973 --> 04:40.889
It's your name.
Oh, my God.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.981
Timeline?

04:46.024 --> 04:49.158
I came in early after my morning
meeting with a moose.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.597
Gloria's girlfriends,
they're not a priority.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.685
We'll talk to them.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.600
Everything keeps leading
back to Toby.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.341
He invited her to the party
the night she went missing.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.561
We gotta assume he saw her.
I checked the clips and they--

05:00.604 --> 05:02.302
No one interviewed him.
I know.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.826
And he hasn't posted anything
on social media in two years.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.697
He doesn't want
to be found.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.220
My gut says
he's not in Meade.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.874
Why?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.789
He's not showing up on
any of his friends' feeds.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.401
That's pretty hard to pull off
in a place that small.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.489
You think
he left the state?

05:15.532 --> 05:17.142
Eh, not likely.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.840
I'll do a deep dive
on socials.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.581
There's gotta be a clue.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.803
Sylvie.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.632
She'll be there at 10:00.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.242
Gabriel.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.635
You finish going through
the traps?

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
Yes, I did, and thank you again
for that assignment.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.422
It really meant
a lot to me.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.859
So I started with
the building department.

05:37.902 --> 05:41.036
Trinity Lutheran filed a permit
to expand their Sunday school.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.430
And some entity named
True North LLC

05:43.473 --> 05:45.519
sold a property
at 224 6th Street.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.347
What?
What, what?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.305
Did you say
224 6th Street?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.437
Yeah.
That's Rita's.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.829
Rita's selling!

05:51.873 --> 05:53.788
Rita's selling?
No way.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.398
She's an institution.
Her pancakes are insane.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.748
They're so good.
I can't believe it!

05:57.792 --> 05:59.620
- What happened?
- Rita is selling.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.317
What?
I was literally just there.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.666
She didn't say anything.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.015
Gabriel just found
the transfer record.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.408
I gotta find out why.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.496
Do you mind
if I take this?

06:06.540 --> 06:08.368
Oh, I'd be honored.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.586
I think she's asking Bob, dude.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.719
It's all yours. Uh...

06:11.762 --> 06:12.850
Rita's closing.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.635
What is happening
in this world?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.158
Maybe congratulate Yuna.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.551
It's her first front page.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.596
Yeah, sure.
Good morning.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.163
Stanley.
Lunch today--

06:21.206 --> 06:23.600
you, me, and our esteemed
publisher, Aaron Pritchard.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.862
Well, that's a hard pass.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.299
Not a request.
He's flying in from Fairbanks.

06:27.343 --> 06:30.085
Stanley...
Humor me.
His family keeps the lights on.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.870
Don't blame me
if things go sideways.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.438
You? Sideways?
Never.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.179
What's he like?
Pritchard.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.355
Rich guy, daddy issues.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.575
High five
on your first A1.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.633
You know this might
be difficult.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.070
They told me
I couldn't get the autopsy.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.768
The cops?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.117
Not surprising.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.379
Not at all.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.687
N-A-N-M-A-C.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.471
Nanmac.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.691
Mm, I'm not permitted to
turn over that report.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.954
It's an open investigation
in Meade.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.956
It's been open
for two years now.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.392
Sorry.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.785
Hi.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.961
That autopsy
is public record.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.789
So unless
you can cite the law

07:21.832 --> 07:23.181
that allows you to withhold it
right now,

07:23.225 --> 07:24.531
I suggest you share it.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.793
Who are you?

07:25.836 --> 07:27.490
A reporter from <i>
The Daily Alaskan.</i>

07:27.534 --> 07:29.623
We both are.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.146
You're writing a story
about this?

07:31.189 --> 07:32.887
Yes, we are.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.975
Helen.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.426
Hey.
Someone forget something?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.602
Here on work.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.387
I'm doing a story
on why you're selling.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.435
I have nothing to say.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.698
It's a private matter.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.440
It's not.
It was in public records.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.703
Who did you sell to?

08:06.747 --> 08:09.227
Claire,
I told you I can't.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.708
You can't or you won't?

08:14.755 --> 08:16.234
Rita, why would you
sell this place?

08:16.278 --> 08:18.280
It's a great business.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.542
Are you moving?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.283
No!

08:21.326 --> 08:22.632
This is home.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.721
I love it here.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.636
I just didn't
have a choice.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.464
Did someone
pressure you to sell?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.335
No.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.903
I can't talk about it, Claire.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.950
Rita, I'm writing this story
either way.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.778
I just want
to get this right.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.956
You can't fix this.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.827
No one can.

08:43.871 --> 08:47.004
So, no comment
or whatever they say.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.755
Look at these injuries.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.802
Skull fractures, lacerations, contusions.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.152
All consistent with
an assault.

09:04.195 --> 09:07.285
And the cause of death
is listed as undetermined.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.592
And they swabbed for DNA,
but there's no test results.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.028
That makes no sense.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.682
Are there photos?

09:15.076 --> 09:16.817
Of Gloria?

09:16.860 --> 09:19.036
There are, but I--

09:19.080 --> 09:20.864
I want to see them.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.631
Can you explain to me
how it is they swabbed for DNA

09:48.675 --> 09:50.241
but there's no lab report?

09:50.285 --> 09:51.242
I don't know.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.679
Care to guess?

09:52.722 --> 09:55.856
Um, it would really help, Helen.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.335
We know this isn't
your mess.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.163
We're just trying to
sort it out.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.253
I think it's just too expensive
to run a DNA test on every case.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.864
They're $2,500 apiece.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.561
So this is about money.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.085
Look, the truth is,
even if they did test her,

10:08.129 --> 10:10.044
they don't really have anything
to match it against.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.349
What do you mean?

10:11.393 --> 10:14.004
There is a national
FBI database.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.703
Not that I know of.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.619
The paper did a story on this
three years ago.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.142
The Attorney General promised

10:21.185 --> 10:23.448
that the state was
going to create a DNA library.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.059
Hasn't happened yet.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.322
Maybe they're still
working on it.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.933
Three years
for a database?

10:29.977 --> 10:32.370
They bet
we'd forget about it.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.068
Well, that's a bet
they're gonna lose.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.164
Uh-huh.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.948
Anything else?

10:44.992 --> 10:46.558
Got it. Okay.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.517
Thank you very much.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.866
I gotta know.

10:50.998 --> 10:51.999
Big Burger.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.391
Big Burger?

10:53.435 --> 10:54.958
Rita sold to Big Burger?!

10:55.002 --> 10:56.960
She cashed out.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.179
I don't think so.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.571
She said
she didn't have a choice.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.834
She couldn't talk about it.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.662
You think Big Burger
squeezed her?

11:02.705 --> 11:04.489
Why else would she sell?

11:04.533 --> 11:05.665
She's not moving.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.710
If she was just tired,
she would say it.

11:07.754 --> 11:08.842
Wow.
People are gonna flip out.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.104
Did you get a comment?

11:10.147 --> 11:12.106
Talked to this guy.
Head of PR.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.716
He gave me nothing.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.675
I know there's more
to this story.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
Write it up,
see what shakes loose.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.722
I'm gonna do that.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.507
Didn't we do
a story on this?

11:22.551 --> 11:24.031
Yeah,
three years ago.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.903
The AG made a bunch of promises
but nothing changed.

11:26.947 --> 11:30.124
The police departments aren't
DNA-swabbing offenders.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.734
There is an FBI database,

11:31.778 --> 11:34.084
but almost no one in Alaska
is feeding into it.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.652
No swabbing, no testing,
no database.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.872
No database,
no catching the bad guys.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.438
We should publish a story.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.266
Too early.
We need more reporting.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.834
The coroner's report is
a clear indication of assault.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.880
They didn't DNA test her.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.664
They're not testing offenders.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.318
They don't want to
solve these crimes.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.276
Okay, but this isn't
daily reporting.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.496
You can't publish every scoop
on a long-form investigation.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.324
You do that,
you'll tip off the cops.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.500
Good. We'll finally
hold them accountable.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.154
Yeah, and they'll get
ahead of us,

12:00.197 --> 12:01.590
and we'll hit a brick wall.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.547
We gotta be patient.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.245
Patient?

12:04.288 --> 12:06.160
Tell that to the next mother of
a Native missing girl.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.683
If we don't do it right,
we'll be telling

12:07.727 --> 12:09.990
those same mothers that
for another hundred years.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.168
She's right.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.430
We publish
when the time is right.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.561
For now, we hold.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.911
Good.
We're in agreement.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.521
- I'm not.
- Stanley is.
That's good enough for me.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.957
We done?

12:27.964 --> 12:29.966
Hey, Roz.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.402
I know
it doesn't feel like it,

12:31.446 --> 12:33.796
but we want the same thing
you do.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.189
I think the only thing
Eileen wants

12:35.232 --> 12:37.147
is to get back to New York.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.801
To save her career.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.195
For me, this story's
deeply personal.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.198
It's about my community.
My life.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.114
And that's why
I put you on this.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.073
I told you I was willing to
take this story all the way.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.076
But you can't
do this alone.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.210
Not an investigation
of this scope.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.429
You might question
her motivations,

12:58.473 --> 13:01.302
but Eileen is
a damn good reporter.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.826
You don't have to like her.

13:03.870 --> 13:04.958
But use her.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.886
When Stanley told me he was
going to New York to hire you,

13:19.929 --> 13:21.583
I thought, frankly,
he was nuts.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.280
I said there is no way
you can get her,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.892
but he assured me
he would bring you back.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.545
Did he?

13:27.589 --> 13:29.330
He did.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.940
And here you are.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.768
It's amazing how
things work out, right?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.292
You needed a job,
Stanley shows up, boom.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.728
I had a job.

13:36.772 --> 13:37.817
I'm writing a book.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.601
About what?

13:39.644 --> 13:42.212
Well, I'll send you a copy
when I'm finished.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.736
I can't wait.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.870
So, this-- this is kind of
a reunion for you two, right?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.306
How'd you first meet?

13:49.350 --> 13:51.743
Stanley?

13:51.787 --> 13:54.659
I hired her at
the <i>Cleveland Dispatch.</i>

13:54.703 --> 13:56.357
She wrote a great story,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.012
but I got pressure
not to publish.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.798
I caved,
and she left.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.757
I regret it to this day.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.890
It won't happen again.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.894
Okay, I have to ask.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.069
Who pressured you?

14:13.113 --> 14:14.679
My publisher.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.899
Speaking of...

14:16.943 --> 14:18.466
were you born and raised here,
Aaron?

14:18.509 --> 14:19.859
I was.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.035
Brief stint at Dartmouth,
then right back here.

14:22.078 --> 14:25.038
I live in Juneau, but I'm back
and forth for business.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.866
I keep a room right here at
Captain Cook,

14:26.909 --> 14:29.129
so we're neighbors.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.261
This your first time
in Alaska?

14:31.305 --> 14:32.567
It is.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.351
How do you like it?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.526
I've only been here
four days.

14:35.570 --> 14:36.832
You ski?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.356
No.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.228
Fish?
Nope.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.490
Hike?
Well, walk.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.057
You know, I'm from New York, so...

14:44.100 --> 14:47.234
Well, the trails in the Chugach
are incredible.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.975
I'd be honored to show you sometime

14:49.018 --> 14:50.672
if you'd ever like to go.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.543
Question.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.676
A question from
Eileen Fitzgerald.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.591
Stanley, do I need
my lawyer present?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.462
Just your wits.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.943
Why'd your family
buy the paper?

15:00.987 --> 15:03.032
Because
I love journalism.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.948
Sure, but what's in it
for you, really?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.472
Ego? Vanity?
Influence?

15:12.607 --> 15:16.698
I bought the paper because this
state has a lot of problems.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.134
It's a place where
people do what they want

15:18.178 --> 15:19.440
and take what they want

15:19.483 --> 15:21.181
because no one's looking out
for the public good.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.966
Hence <i>
The Daily Alaskan.</i>

15:24.010 --> 15:27.013
The Pritchards saved the paper
from bankruptcy.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.449
And I promised my father

15:28.492 --> 15:30.886
that I'd make the paper
economically sustainable.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.975
While still supporting
your reporters?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.368
Of course.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.804
But I-I do have to say,

15:35.847 --> 15:36.979
we do not
have the resources

15:37.023 --> 15:38.198
that you're used to
at <i>The Vanguard.</i>

15:38.241 --> 15:39.982
Oh, I'm aware.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.592
Curious.

15:41.636 --> 15:45.466
Uh, your family owns a lot of
different business ventures.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.077
Is there anything that's
off limits for the paper?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
Not if you
get your facts right.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.821
I always get my facts right.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.215
Well, not to be disrespectful now,

15:55.258 --> 15:57.782
but you wouldn't be here
if that were true.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.096
Any luck on the search?

16:07.140 --> 16:09.316
Nope.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.579
Toby does not
want to be found.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.146
Neither do I,
but here I am.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.626
Whoa. Claire,
that Rita's story's exploding.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.671
I told you
people were gonna flip.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.412
Yeah.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.153
And I only got half of it.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.415
I still don't know
why she's selling.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.550
Oh, God. I gotta pick up
a birthday cake for my kid.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.725
Ooh, what kind?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.379
Double chocolate
with vanilla icing.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.728
Yum!

16:30.772 --> 16:32.556
I'll bring leftovers.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.863
Oh. I'm an idiot.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.821
I didn't check
Toby's birthday timeline.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.262
"Happy birthday, T!

16:42.305 --> 16:44.351
Would love to see you when
you're in Anchorage soon.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.135
Love you, Uncle Ned!"

16:49.573 --> 16:51.445
So that went well.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.837
Well, it didn't go
really badly.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.535
Agreed.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.666
Hey, by the way,
you could've told me

16:55.710 --> 16:56.754
the paper was in
a strip mall.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.060
Didn't I mention that?

16:58.104 --> 17:00.193
No, you didn't.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.461
Thank you again, sincerely.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.332
Uh-huh.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.205
You're right.
Daddy issues.

17:12.248 --> 17:15.034
Toby has an uncle
in Anchorage.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.644
They seem close.

17:16.687 --> 17:17.688
I got an address.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.038
Great.
Leave in 15?

17:19.081 --> 17:20.082
Sure.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.651
Eileen Fitzgerald.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.044
Concerned Citizen: <i>
Hello, Eileen.</i>

17:25.087 --> 17:26.958
<i>Did you get my e-mail?</i>

17:27.002 --> 17:28.264
Hello,
Concerned Citizen.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.657
How nice of you
to call again.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.093
I did not
get your e-mail.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.529
But you somehow got
my cellphone number.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.749
How'd you manage
to do that?

17:34.792 --> 17:37.621
<i>Like you,
I have my ways.</i>

17:39.536 --> 17:40.885
I see that.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.931
It's like you're
my own personal paparazzi.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.237
Got some bad news for you--

17:44.280 --> 17:46.674
you're not gonna be able to
sell those photos.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.502
<i>You think this is a joke?</i>

17:48.545 --> 17:50.156
<i>This isn't a joke.</i>

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
Don't get upset.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.073
Tell you what-- how about you
step out of your truck

17:54.116 --> 17:55.465
and we talk about it
face to face?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.659
We support Rita!
We support Rita!

18:15.703 --> 18:17.922
Hey, Miles.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.229
Hey, Claire.
Look what you started.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.361
We support Rita!

18:21.404 --> 18:22.710
Anything I should know?

18:22.753 --> 18:24.712
Yeah,
it's a total pro-Rita crowd.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.149
We support Rita!
We support Rita!

18:27.193 --> 18:29.195
Some wild theories about
why she's selling.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.893
One lady said Big Burger
kidnapped Rita.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.286
Gotta love the Internet.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.376
- Oh, yeah.
- We support Rita!
We support Rita!

18:36.419 --> 18:38.204
Claire Muncy, <i>
The Daily Alaskan.</i>

18:38.247 --> 18:40.293
I'd like to ask you a couple
questions, if that's okay.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.790
Hey.
Got a minute to talk?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.142
Ned Crenshaw?

19:03.185 --> 19:05.318
Yeah.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.842
I'm Roz Friendly
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

19:07.885 --> 19:09.060
This is my colleague, Eileen.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.106
Hey.
How you doing?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.760
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

19:12.803 --> 19:15.066
about your nephew, Toby.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.590
He in some kind
of trouble?

19:16.633 --> 19:18.679
No.
We'd like his help.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.942
We're investigating the death of
his friend, Gloria Nanmac.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.379
Toby's a good kid.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.815
He'd never hurt anyone.

19:24.859 --> 19:28.428
We're not saying he did.
We just want to talk to him.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.822
I can't help you.
Have a good day.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.911
You all set for winter,
Ned?

19:33.955 --> 19:36.175
I see your freezer.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.090
I got my salmon last week.
You?

19:40.744 --> 19:41.963
Tanner crab this year.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.922
Mm.
That's a lot of boxes.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.141
Someone in your family
crew on a boat?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.321
Please leave.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.674
What's with the fish?

19:57.718 --> 19:59.328
That's his
subsistence freezer.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.591
It's tradition that a family
shares food for the winter.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.245
You think
Toby sent him crab.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.682
Based on those boxes,
it's from someplace commercial.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.684
My bet, Toby's working on
a crab boat.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.251
Okay, but where?

20:09.295 --> 20:11.558
Wherever they fish
for Tanner crab.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.299
My round.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.430
Thank you.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.866
Uh, I couldn't help
but notice

20:15.910 --> 20:18.695
the Jordan Teller story trending
huge on social media.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.654
Thanks.
That means a lot.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.570
Guys...

20:23.613 --> 20:25.833
Big Burger sent over some bags
of burgers and fries.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.356
What?! Why?

20:27.400 --> 20:28.575
They're trying to
buy our support.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.446
It won't work,
but those burgers are fire.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.451
Okay. So I'm starving.
You mind if I...

20:35.495 --> 20:37.453
- Oh, get in there, yeah.
- Me too, actually.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.716
Hold.
Do not eat that.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.327
As much as
it pains me to say it,

20:41.370 --> 20:43.285
it's a direct
conflict of interest.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.681
"Dear Claire.
Thanks for the call.

20:47.724 --> 20:51.075
We appreciate your work.
Here's a sample of ours!

20:51.119 --> 20:53.382
Your friends
at Big Burger."

20:53.426 --> 20:57.430
Just saying, how about we finish
before Claire gets back?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.475
She's the only one
writing about this.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.609
That sounds like a fix.

21:02.652 --> 21:03.827
Gimme one.

21:09.616 --> 21:10.747
Mmm!

21:10.791 --> 21:12.401
Yeah.
We need a Big Burger.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.229
Agreed.
Absolutely delicious.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.883
This is so damn good.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.841
I mean, I feel guilty,
but damn...

21:17.885 --> 21:20.235
What, are you guys stoned
or something?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.281
Just poor and hungry.
Free Big Burger.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.501
I'm in.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.982
Bob, where do they fish
Tanner crab?

21:28.025 --> 21:29.592
Tanner?

21:29.636 --> 21:31.812
I believe that would be Kodiak
and Dutch Harbor.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.857
Why?
Hmm.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.904
We think Toby Crenshaw might be
working on a Tanner crab boat.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.993
Oh, crew manifests are filed
with the harbor master.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.211
The database
should be online.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.604
Great.
All hands on deck.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.084
We need help
searching all boats

21:43.127 --> 21:45.173
operating out of Kodiak
and Dutch Harbor.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.001
Eileen,
what are you doing?

21:47.044 --> 21:48.524
Reporting.
What should I be doing?

21:48.568 --> 21:51.266
You can't just dole out
assignments to my reporters.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.050
Bob, you guys are all
sitting here eating swag.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.488
If that takes precedence over
a murder investigation,

21:55.531 --> 21:57.664
we have different ideas
of journalism.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.797
Bob, this might be
a real break.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.495
Please.

22:02.538 --> 22:05.367
Fine.
Get it done.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.195
But next time,
can you ask me first?

22:07.238 --> 22:09.066
Consider it done.

22:11.982 --> 22:12.940
Can I try some fries?

22:12.983 --> 22:14.898
Yeah, yeah.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.160
What's going on?

22:19.033 --> 22:21.731
Big Burger
sent some samples.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
So we sampled.

22:23.254 --> 22:27.171
Let me guess, from my "friend"
Ryan Rogers in PR.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.261
But he had them flown in from
Seattle on the Big Burger jet.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.439
Those guys have so much money,
they can do whatever they want.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.311
Including taking away
a piece of our history.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
So make them work for it.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.141
Any ideas?

22:40.184 --> 22:42.230
You guys have
a historical society?

22:42.273 --> 22:44.363
Yeah.
Call and get a comment.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.365
They live to save places
like Rita's.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.801
That'll stir the pot.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.629
Thanks.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.239
All right.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.675
Crew manifests--
let's go.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.498
I got him.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.282
He's in Kodiak.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.763
He's crewing on a boat called
the <i>Southern Ridge.</i>

23:36.806 --> 23:38.286
Great.
Where's Kodiak?

23:38.329 --> 23:39.940
South.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.289
Problem is, it looks like
his boat leaves tomorrow.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.856
When will it be back?

23:42.899 --> 23:44.684
Boats can be out there for
two, three months at a time.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.903
All right, so we have to go.
How do we get there?

23:46.947 --> 23:48.470
Only one way-- fly.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.254
When's the next flight?

23:50.298 --> 23:53.127
There's two flights a day.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.781
They're both sold out.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.173
Bummer.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.004
We are not chartering
a flight to Kodiak.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.050
I can't spend a third of our
travel budget for the month

24:03.093 --> 24:04.921
on a speculative trip.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.054
What? This is how it works.
This is how I work.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.447
<i>Worked.</i>

24:08.490 --> 24:10.449
You're not at <i>The Vanguard</i> anymore.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.928
You heard Pritchard
at lunch.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.453
We don't have the resources
to fly around on every whim.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.063
A whim?
It's not a whim.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.804
It's a lead, a good one.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.459
And I'm not about to let it sail
off into a speculative sunset.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.160
What?

24:29.032 --> 24:30.860
So, what's the play?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.819
We're going to Kodiak
tomorrow morning.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.256
Really?
Really.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.087
Jamie,
that was quick.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.437
Yeah,
I'm doing all right.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.231
♪ I don't wanna get
left behind ♪

24:56.059 --> 24:57.321
♪ Gonna love my baby
all the time ♪

24:57.365 --> 25:00.150
Kodiak Traffic--
Beaver 825 X-Ray Lima,

25:00.194 --> 25:02.544
approaching 10 miles northeast.

25:02.588 --> 25:06.374
So you really are a pilot.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.333
Read my poems.
I wasn't making that up, either.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.552
You're a poet, too?

25:10.596 --> 25:12.728
A poet pilot.

25:12.772 --> 25:13.947
Only in Alaska.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.255
Hey, how--
how are you doing?

25:18.299 --> 25:20.954
With, uh, flying,
since your last flight?

25:20.997 --> 25:22.303
What happened
on the last flight?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.653
Nothing.
I'm fine.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.003
You do a lot of charters?

25:27.047 --> 25:32.226
Uh, I once had to fly
a pregnant Shetland pony

25:32.269 --> 25:34.402
to the Anchorage vet
before she went into labor,

25:34.445 --> 25:37.753
but ferrying reporters
to get a scoop,

25:37.797 --> 25:39.538
that's-- that's a first.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.845
It's more of a lead, but...
still grateful.

25:42.889 --> 25:46.588
Yeah, well, either way,
I'm glad you called.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.243
So, how do you two
know each other?

25:49.286 --> 25:50.853
College.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.597
So, like, you two are partners
on this story?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.251
Something like that.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.209
How's that going?

25:59.253 --> 26:01.037
Still new.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.083
I'm gonna drop you two off,

26:03.126 --> 26:04.824
then I'm gonna take some
supplies to Chiniak.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.391
Milk run?
Yep.

26:07.435 --> 26:10.917
A lot of these villages are
off the road system,

26:10.960 --> 26:13.441
so if you got a plane nearby,
you bring people supplies.

26:13.484 --> 26:17.053
Good stuff, Santa.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.057
Kodiak.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.325
I don't know when this
zoning meeting's gonna end.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.066
Can you grab the kids
from karate?

26:30.110 --> 26:31.851
<i>I can't. I'm prepping this
Donnelly River case.</i>

26:31.894 --> 26:32.852
I know, Jeff.
This just came up.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.288
<i>Come on, Claire.</i>

26:34.331 --> 26:35.724
Last week, you bailed on
dinner with my parents.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.683
Before that,
it was Aiden's dentist.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.032
Stories are
always coming up.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.861
That's not fair.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.645
It's not like
it's the Pentagon Papers.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.864
Get someone else to cover it.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.344
And for what it's worth,
I love Big Burger.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.782
<i>Good for you, Jeff,
but I don't really care.</i>

26:49.825 --> 26:52.088
I'm convinced that
Rita didn't want to sell,

26:52.132 --> 26:53.481
and I'm gonna find out why.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.309
So, no, I'm not gonna let
someone else cover it.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.616
Okay, great.
I will deal with the kids.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.095
Bye.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.678
This should be easy.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.553
Let's find
the harbor master.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.822
Yeah,
they're still here.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.519
C Finger is Gc12.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.260
Can you translate that
for us?

27:33.303 --> 27:35.741
Come on, lady, figure it out.
I got a job, too.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.003
Harbor.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.452
Nope.

27:51.495 --> 27:55.804
Hey, we're looking for
a C Finger Gc12.

27:55.848 --> 27:56.892
They're up the way.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.155
Back that way?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.297
Hey.
Do you know Toby Crenshaw?

28:10.340 --> 28:12.299
Yeah.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.996
Is he here?

28:14.040 --> 28:16.520
Nope.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.131
Helpful.

28:18.174 --> 28:20.786
Guess we're waiting.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.573
Zoning Chair: Okay,
let's get started, please.

28:25.616 --> 28:26.792
We're about to begin.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.449
Heads up, Claire.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.757
These people are
super tweaked.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.193
Yeah, looks like it.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.369
Thank you for coming.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.371
We're here to consider
the matter of

28:41.415 --> 28:44.810
Big Burger's application
to tear down Rita's diner.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.466
Quiet, please.

28:49.510 --> 28:53.209
There is also an application
to name Rita's a city landmark.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.428
Boo!

28:54.471 --> 28:57.518
If the board grants Rita's
landmark status,

28:57.561 --> 28:59.738
then the Big Burger Corporation
will be required

28:59.781 --> 29:01.304
to find another parcel
to build on.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.784
Nobody touches Rita's!

29:02.828 --> 29:04.438
The government has no right

29:04.481 --> 29:06.135
telling a company
they can't build!

29:06.179 --> 29:07.528
That's socialism!

29:07.571 --> 29:09.138
Order, please,
or we will adjourn.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.966
He's right!

29:11.010 --> 29:13.882
We'll start with comments
from Mr. Rogers,

29:13.926 --> 29:15.666
Big Burger's head of PR.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.672
Thank you, Leslie.

29:21.716 --> 29:22.848
Good afternoon, folks.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.327
My name is Ryan Rogers,

29:24.371 --> 29:26.286
and when Big Burger
opens a location,

29:26.329 --> 29:28.331
we're bringing jobs
and opportunity.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.332
But much more than that--

29:29.376 --> 29:31.160
Go work in the lower 48!

29:31.204 --> 29:32.858
We don't need
that crap here!

29:32.901 --> 29:34.685
I appreciate your passion, sir.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.558
Now, we understand Rita's is
beloved in Anchorage--

29:37.601 --> 29:39.560
Corporate greed
is destroying America!

29:39.603 --> 29:41.301
Shut up
and let the guy talk!

29:41.344 --> 29:42.868
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Don't you talk to me like that,
lady!

29:42.911 --> 29:44.739
I will if you don't stop
interrupting people.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.698
- That's elitist crap.
- Shut your face, dude.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.613
Oh, yeah?
Or what?

29:49.657 --> 29:51.006
Huh, grandpa?

29:51.050 --> 29:52.747
- Okay, now.
- Or I'll kick your ass.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.879
Nah, go to hell.

29:57.665 --> 29:58.797
Sit down!

29:58.840 --> 30:00.146
Order!

30:00.189 --> 30:02.409
Okay!
There's no need for this!

30:02.452 --> 30:03.932
Order!

30:13.289 --> 30:16.292
So, were you and Jamie
close in college?

30:16.336 --> 30:17.511
Huh?

30:17.554 --> 30:18.729
Oh.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.819
Yeah. BFFs.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.391
Hey.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
Toby?

30:30.002 --> 30:30.959
Toby Crenshaw?

30:31.003 --> 30:32.482
Yeah.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.833
I'm Roz Friendly.
This is Eileen Fitzgerald.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.400
We're reporters for <i>
The Daily Alaskan.</i>

30:37.444 --> 30:39.838
Like to talk to you
about Gloria Nanmac.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.231
I got nothing to say.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.103
We just want to know
what happened to Gloria.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.452
I don't want
to talk about it.

30:45.495 --> 30:46.888
Well, you invited her out
that night.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.368
Why?

30:48.411 --> 30:49.891
I just did.
We were friends.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.241
Friends?
That's it?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.201
Yeah.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.811
That's it.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.119
Toby, anything you say
is off the record.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.903
No one has to know
that we spoke.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.818
I don't believe you.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.080
They'll find out.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.516
I'm not gonna
take any chances.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.083
- Who are "they"?
- No one.

31:08.127 --> 31:08.910
I-- I just don't want
to talk about it!

31:08.954 --> 31:09.911
I gotta go!

31:09.955 --> 31:11.652
Did you kill her, Toby?

31:11.695 --> 31:12.914
What?

31:12.958 --> 31:14.742
No.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.526
I didn't do anything.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.399
So, who was Gloria with
when she disappeared?

31:19.442 --> 31:21.140
I don't know.
I didn't go to the afterparty.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.577
Gloria went to
an afterparty?

31:23.620 --> 31:25.361
Where was it?
Whose house?

31:25.405 --> 31:27.363
Some guy called Skeeter.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.365
Skeeter?
Does Skeeter have a last name?

31:29.409 --> 31:30.540
A real one?

31:30.584 --> 31:32.107
No.
I don't know him.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.544
But you know she went
to the afterparty.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.850
How?

31:40.376 --> 31:41.987
She called.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.119
Asked me to come and get her,
all right?

31:44.163 --> 31:46.078
But we had a fight,

31:46.121 --> 31:47.949
and I was still pissed off,

31:47.993 --> 31:49.820
so I didn't.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.301
Toby, let's go!

31:52.345 --> 31:55.522
It doesn't matter anymore.

31:55.565 --> 31:58.003
She's dead.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.352
Don't use my name.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.484
I'm serious.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.485
Don't.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.402
He's scared.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.578
Now we know
there was a second party.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.102
Hosted by Skeeter.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.587
Break time.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.981
Thanks.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.896
Sorry about today.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.463
I didn't mean to make
such a thing of it.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.944
Me neither.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.860
How'd it go
at the town hall?

32:29.904 --> 32:31.166
Nuts.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.255
Like everything else
these days.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.605
It's upsetting.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.216
I work so hard
to get the facts right

32:37.259 --> 32:39.261
only to see people use the facts
to attack the other side.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.523
Mm.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.742
They don't want
to be informed.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.092
They just want to
win the argument.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.529
It's like,
why do I even do this job?

32:46.573 --> 32:47.922
The money.

32:50.577 --> 32:53.058
You know, maybe that's what
this story is about.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.103
It's about the city.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.149
Rita's selling is a symbol

32:57.192 --> 32:59.107
of a community
that's lost its center.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.718
Which means you're right,
Claire--

33:01.762 --> 33:03.024
this is an important story.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.117
Stanley?
This can't be good.

33:09.161 --> 33:10.292
Hello?

33:22.348 --> 33:23.566
Hi.
I'm with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

33:23.610 --> 33:24.654
Anyone hurt?

33:24.698 --> 33:25.786
Place was empty.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.657
- Any idea what started it?
- I don't know.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.529
Lots of crazies around this
place the last few days.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.748
Looks like one of them
took it too far.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.316
Back up!
Get 'em back!

33:46.894 --> 33:48.287
Hello, Anchorage Center.

33:48.330 --> 33:52.073
De Havilland November 825
X-Ray Lima, final approach.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.510
<i>Welcome back to Anchorage.</i>

33:54.554 --> 33:56.338
<i>Uh, keep heading southwest.</i>

33:56.382 --> 33:57.600
<i>We'll get you all settled.</i>

34:04.303 --> 34:07.871
Hey, uh...

34:07.915 --> 34:11.788
can I, uh, buy you a drink
as a thank-you?

34:14.748 --> 34:16.097
Can I ask you a question?

34:16.141 --> 34:17.794
Sure.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.927
Would you have
called me again

34:19.970 --> 34:21.929
if you didn't need a ride
to Kodiak?

34:21.972 --> 34:24.975
Um... yeah.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.330
Um, I'm gonna pass
on the drink.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.245
Thank you.

34:33.288 --> 34:36.291
Good luck
with your article.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.728
Thanks.

34:43.559 --> 34:44.560
You good?

34:44.604 --> 34:45.735
Yep.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.880
Haven't you done enough?

34:59.923 --> 35:02.448
If you'd stopped
writing about it,

35:02.491 --> 35:03.971
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

35:04.014 --> 35:08.280
I am so sorry it happened, Rita.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.934
Do you have any idea who might
have started the fire?

35:10.978 --> 35:12.501
No.

35:12.545 --> 35:15.156
And, to be honest,
I don't care.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.505
It's done.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.594
And now they have
nothing to fight over.

35:18.638 --> 35:21.075
I saw you
at the town hall.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.904
All that anger,
it was ugly.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.167
Try dealing with it
every day.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.300
Is that how you felt?

35:28.343 --> 35:34.262
It broke my heart
to see friends, family,

35:34.306 --> 35:39.615
sit at the diner,
unable to talk without fighting.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.400
So you sold it.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.184
And then
they fought about that.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.447
It was never gonna end.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.238
Is that why
you started the fire?

35:57.067 --> 35:59.722
Rita,
you could be arrested.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.464
Big Burger was gonna
tear it down anyway.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.380
I just...

36:05.424 --> 36:08.427
I just snapped.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.689
Why didn't you tell me

36:09.732 --> 36:11.212
that's why you wanted to sell
when I asked?

36:11.256 --> 36:13.040
I was ashamed.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.304
This is still my home, Claire.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.394
The customers
are like family.

36:19.438 --> 36:23.920
It's not easy to tell family you
can't take their crap anymore.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.970
I feel like the paper used to be
like your restaurant.

36:30.013 --> 36:33.887
A place for people to read about
and discuss ideas,

36:33.930 --> 36:37.020
to have a conversation.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.631
And now?

36:38.674 --> 36:40.850
It's different.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.156
The Internet.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.810
Social media.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.377
Opinions over facts.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.900
And fighting.

36:46.943 --> 36:50.208
So why do you
keep doing it?

36:50.251 --> 36:52.645
Because I'm not ready
to give up.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.343
On the paper.

36:55.387 --> 36:58.085
Or Alaska.

36:58.128 --> 37:01.175
Maybe I shouldn't
have torched it.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.786
Maybe not.

37:07.442 --> 37:11.272
But you can still help.

37:11.316 --> 37:14.449
There was an afterparty thrown
by a guy named Skeeter.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.146
A second house.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.192
That's where
she was last seen.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.063
Have you reached out
to this Skeeter?

37:20.107 --> 37:22.283
The only thing Toby gave us
was a nickname.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.589
Nothing yet.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.765
We gotta get to Meade,
start knocking on doors.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.245
Someone will
know something.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.769
In the villages,
everyone knows your business.

37:29.812 --> 37:30.639
Have you been to Meade?

37:30.683 --> 37:32.293
Once.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.208
Good. I need to see it,
get a sense of it.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.776
Boots on the ground.
It's time.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.386
Book your flights to Meade.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.086
I'm not sure
how you got to Kodiak,

37:43.130 --> 37:45.698
and I'm not sure I want to know,
but this is good work.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.315
You were right
to hold the article.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.709
We have more to take
to the cops in Meade.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.324
Oh, no.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.760
What?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.327
<i>Breaking news tonight.</i>

38:06.371 --> 38:08.111
<i>Anchorage resident

38:46.541 --> 38:48.935
<i>Rita never did.</i>

38:48.978 --> 38:52.025
<i>That's because she made you
feel like family,</i>

38:52.068 --> 38:55.245
<i>which means even more
in a place like Alaska.</i>

39:01.426 --> 39:04.298

39:13.176 --> 39:15.831
<i>This reporter,
like many of you,</i>

39:15.875 --> 39:18.225
<i>believed Rita selling

crushing mom and pop.</i>

<i>Ours.</i>

<i>Rita agreed to talk with me because,</i>

<i>the truth is, she grew so tired
of the fighting,</i>

39:34.328 --> 39:36.852
<i>she burned her beloved diner

39:36.896 --> 39:39.986
<i>This is what she told me--</i>

39:40.029 --> 39:43.903
<i>"We think the louder we talk,
