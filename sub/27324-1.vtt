01:58.994 --> 01:59.994
Dad...

02:03.999 --> 02:05.786
<i>Hey, sorry about the delay;</i>

02:05.876 --> 02:07.617
the storm at LaGuardia
was really bad.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.043
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

02:09.670 --> 02:11.537
I was just waiting
about an hour.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.761
This airport seems bigger now.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.958
When was the last time
you were here?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.727
Wasn't it like, Thanksgiving?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.554
Yeah... in '82.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.847
(Woman) <i>Are they here?</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:07.597
[dog barking]

03:19.991 --> 03:21.232
<i>Aw... Landry?</i>

03:21.326 --> 03:22.326
<i>Don't let him out?</i>

03:22.411 --> 03:25.245
<i>My best boy?
I have missed you so much.</i>

03:26.248 --> 03:28.991
<i>- Dad, you got it?
- Yep?</i>

03:29.084 --> 03:31.747
- Oh, Adrian.
- Hey, Mom.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.331
Goodness gracious,
you've gotten so thin!

03:36.425 --> 03:38.087
Yeah, he had a stomach flu.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.758
- Are you alright now?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.053
I'll take this big ol' bag
of rocks in your room.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.131
Andrew?
Andrew, your brother's here.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.059
Hey, Andrew.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.228
Wow, man,
you've gotten so tall.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.936
Hey, can I get a hug?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.650
Oh, Andrew...
He's just being a little shy.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.384
- It's fine, Mom.
- He's very excited to see you.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.400
- It's fine...
- Andrew!

04:04.995 --> 04:06.987
<i>We thank you, Father,
for bringing Adrian</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:09.117
<i>back home safe and sound
to celebrate</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:11.324
this blessed holiday with us.

04:11.418 --> 04:15.082
We pray that You will
watch over and guide him,

04:15.172 --> 04:18.415
as You have watched over
and guided all of us.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.839
Amen.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.212
(All) Amen.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.465
I made all your favorites.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.968
Wow, this looks
really delicious, Mom.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.187
Still playing football Andrew?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.605
He quit last year.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.065
I kinda sucked at it.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.018
No, that's not true now.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.229
Coach Jennings said
you have great potential.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.825
Andrew is the vice president
of the drama club now.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.744
Wow, is that right?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.201
He was in
<i>Arsenic and Old Lace</i> recently.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.907
I was the lead.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.793
You were a very
convincing older man.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.212
And he got the biggest applause.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.006
He needs to speak up
is what he needs to do.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.129
He mumbled through
most of his lines.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.052
I could barely
understand him half the time.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.262
Sorry I missed it, buddy.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.185
I'm sure you were brilliant,

05:13.271 --> 05:15.183
you wouldn't be cast
as a lead otherwise.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.520
Are you still at that same
place, the ad agency?

05:22.614 --> 05:23.445
Yep.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.398
You've been there
a long time. Still like it?

05:26.284 --> 05:29.243
Yeah, it's been three years.
I still like it a lot.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.155
Have you guys seen the

05:32.249 --> 05:34.241
<i>Crunchy Chocolate Puffs</i>
commercial

05:34.334 --> 05:35.950
that's playing right now?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.376
Oh, yeah.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.998
You worked on that?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.455
I wrote parts of it, yeah.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.415
I saw it.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.716
It was lame.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.586
Andrew, that wasn't very nice.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.883
No, he's right, Mom.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.716
It's kinda lame.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.888
How are your roommates?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.227
They're great.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.186
Um, did they go home
for Christmas too?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.111
Mm-hmm.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.358
Where are they from?

06:07.409 --> 06:11.028
Brandon is from New Jersey,
and Leo is from Ohio.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.531
I think I talked to Leo
on the phone once

06:14.624 --> 06:15.785
when you weren't there.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.287
He sounded very nice.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.710
I just can't understand
how three grown men

06:22.799 --> 06:23.710
can still live together.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.587
It's like y'all
are back in college.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.010
Dale, the rents are much
more expensive there.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.883
I'm aware of that it's just...

06:29.973 --> 06:33.967
This pot roast, Mom,
is as good as I remember it.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.972
I've literally had dreams
about your cooking,

06:36.062 --> 06:37.062
I miss it that much.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.809
Thank you, honey,
that's very sweet.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.481
<i>Hey, can you smell Georgie?</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:46.024
Yeah? I think you two
would like each other.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.035
<i>Knock, knock?</i>

06:54.122 --> 06:57.991
Hey... Mom, I'm so full
I can't have another bite.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.825
Come on, will you please
eat this cake?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.627
Your brother's going
to eat it, otherwise,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.670
and all the sugar is not good
for his complexion.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.214
Oh, poor guy.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.469
Alright.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.174
It's... it's really good.
It's very good, Mom.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.136
You know, your Dad wanted to
turn this room into storage

07:18.229 --> 07:22.064
but I just didn't have the heart
to take out all your stuff.

07:24.402 --> 07:29.113
And also I like to
sleep in here sometimes.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.862
You know
how your Dad snores.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.824
I haven't missed that.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.032
I hope you're not
too bothered by Andrew.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.292
No, I'm not.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.503
I know he's still mad at me.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.211
I ran into Carly yesterday
at the store.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.793
She had no idea
you were coming to town.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.970
I thought you guys talk to
each other once in awhile.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.672
Uh, no. It's been awhile.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.600
I just got busy.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.102
Well, it turns out
she moved to Dallas.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.019
She's got a job there.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.106
Yeah, I heard that.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.481
Her Dad had
a heart attack recently,

08:07.570 --> 08:08.435
did you know that?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.238
I didn't know that. Is he OK?

08:12.075 --> 08:16.991
He's recovering, but Carly's
at home helping out her Mom.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.739
She gave me
her new phone number

08:19.833 --> 08:21.745
if you wanna give her a call.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.835
OK.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.746
Christmas wasn't the same
without you.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.925
I'm really glad
you made it back this year.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.840
Yeah, me too, Mom.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.677
Well, you should get some rest.
You must be exhausted.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.770
Yeah.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.972
And eat this cake!

08:45.066 --> 08:46.853
OK! Fine.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.603
- Goodnight, honey.
- Goodnight, Mom.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.161
Landry?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.289
Landry...

09:09.215 --> 09:10.672
It's our little secret, buddy.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.423
Oh, you are hungry!

09:32.197 --> 09:34.439
Shhh... Stop.

09:38.495 --> 09:43.035
Landry, you're such
a bed hog, get off...

09:57.222 --> 09:59.384
(Radio) <i>You're listening to</i>
The Word <i>with Dave Hewitt.</i>

10:00.016 --> 10:03.430
<i>Right before the break,
I was talking about Santa Claus.</i>

10:03.520 --> 10:06.012
<i>How a lot of us,
myself included,</i>

10:06.106 --> 10:07.958
<i>have accepted the dominance
of Santa in Christmas.</i>

10:07.982 --> 10:10.065
- Good morning.
- Mornin'.

10:10.151 --> 10:10.982
Morning.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.296
<i>But Santa Claus
has distracted us...</i>

10:12.320 --> 10:13.686
How'd you sleep?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.646
I slept great.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.153
I hope you're hungry because
breakfast will be ready soon.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.320
Can I do anything?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.072
No, just, have some coffee.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.290
<i>The lie about Santa Claus
may not be a big deal.</i>

10:26.376 --> 10:28.709
<i>I certainly don't think
that it is.</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:32.709
<i>But there are many other lies,
in our society,</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:34.586
<i>that do a lot more damage.</i>

10:35.218 --> 10:36.334
You want more coffee, Dad?

10:36.427 --> 10:38.259
Hmm? No, no. I'm good.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.966
(Radio continues) <i>I'll get more
into this in a minute,</i>

10:44.060 --> 10:47.804
<i>because what I'm ultimately
getting at is the truth.</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:50.731
<i>The church,
our place of worship,</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:53.104
<i>is the foundation of truth.</i>

10:53.194 --> 10:56.107
<i>When we're there having
fellowship with each other,</i>

10:56.197 --> 10:58.109
<i>we hear the truth.</i>

10:58.199 --> 11:01.237
<i>But, when we're not
at the church,</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:07.073
<i>we are surrounded by
so many pervasive lies.</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:12.003
<i>Remember what Jesus said
in John 8:32?</i>

11:12.088 --> 11:14.250
<i>Then you will know the truth,</i>

11:14.340 --> 11:16.832
<i>and the truth
will set you free...</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:19.839
Honey? Are you OK?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.217
Yeah. Yeah, no I'm fine.
I'm just waking up.

11:26.936 --> 11:27.936
[knocking on door]

11:32.275 --> 11:33.275
Andrew?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.146
Andrew...

11:35.945 --> 11:36.856
What?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.232
Mom wants you up for breakfast.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.743
Give it back.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.833
Sorry.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.956
Hey um...

11:55.548 --> 11:58.006
I wanna apologize to you for um,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.070
you not being able to come
to New York to visit me.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.552
I know you were really
bummed about that.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.596
I just...

12:04.682 --> 12:07.800
something came up and I couldn't
get any time off so...

12:12.273 --> 12:13.980
Hey, what are you
listening to nowadays?

12:30.333 --> 12:33.246
Is that Madonna? Since when
were you into Madonna?

12:36.047 --> 12:39.165
Hey, um, I was at her last show,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.000
at Radio City Music Hall.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.634
Wait, you went
to the <i>Virgin</i> Tour?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.056
Yeah! Leo got us
front row tickets.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.053
No way.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.011
It was so much fun, man.
We had such a blast.

12:53.773 --> 12:58.108
I had her other album too but...

12:59.487 --> 13:02.230
Dad found it in my backpack
and threw it away.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.359
Really?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.941
He's thrown away
a bunch of tapes.

13:06.953 --> 13:11.914
I had a Bryan Adams poster
but he tore it off the wall.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.995
There was a sermon at church
about "secular music."

13:17.880 --> 13:19.997
That's nothing new, Andrew,

13:20.091 --> 13:22.959
they'll always find ways
to make that stuff up.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.966
Yeah, well, people around here
don't think it's made up.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.344
You know Mr. Thompson
from down the road?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.395
- Yeah?
- He has all the records.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.518
Oh, yeah.
He has an amazing collection.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.648
He <i>had</i> an amazing collection.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.482
He had Pastor John over and they
burned them all in his backyard.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.817
You could see the smoke
from blocks away.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.493
The fire department had to come
and put it out.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.000
Do you think I'm ugly?

13:57.086 --> 14:00.955
I mean, like, if you weren't
my brother and all.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.382
Andrew, why would you ask that?

14:04.260 --> 14:08.300
Well, I don't know.
The kids at school, they um...

14:09.390 --> 14:11.052
They call me pizza face.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.894
Tommy Clements said
that his sister said

14:15.980 --> 14:17.642
that there's no way
we're related

14:17.732 --> 14:20.349
'cause you're so much
better looking than me.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.234
You're not ugly, OK?

14:23.321 --> 14:27.315
I had really bad skin too.
It goes away after a few years.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.743
Kids can just be assholes.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.916
Also Tommy's older sister,
Susie, was such a bitch.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.162
And no one liked her

14:38.252 --> 14:39.813
because she tried way too hard
to be cool,

14:39.837 --> 14:41.544
so he's probably the same.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.169
You just said the A-word
and the B-word.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.592
Yeah, I'm gonna
call you the A-word

14:47.678 --> 14:49.590
if you don't get up
for breakfast!

14:49.680 --> 14:52.514
It's pancake day!
We eat pancakes!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.511
We can have pancakes...

14:53.601 --> 14:56.093
<i>Knock it off?
Breakfast is ready?</i>

14:56.187 --> 14:57.098
That was your fault.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.053
What?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.147
Yep, all your fault!

15:00.191 --> 15:01.523
<i>Give it all you got now?
Come on?</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:02.984
I'm trying...

15:04.320 --> 15:05.481
So are you seeing anyone?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.357
Barely have time for myself,
much less anyone else, Mom.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.576
'Cause y'know I spoke with Carly

15:12.662 --> 15:14.870
and I think she's
still on the market.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.198
- Mom.
- What?

to explain that to her.

I went to school...

kicked her fucking ass.

between a "dirty Jap"...

50:14.011 --> 50:15.877
I dunno, like, four?

50:15.971 --> 50:18.588
OK, let's see something
you haven't seen.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.682
OK...

50:20.476 --> 50:22.138
Oh. <i>Nightmare 2.</i>

50:22.603 --> 50:24.890
That's rated R.
I can't take you to see that.

50:24.980 --> 50:25.891
Mom and Dad will kill me.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.563
Mom and Dad don't have to know.

50:28.901 --> 50:29.982
Please?

50:35.241 --> 50:37.824
[movie plays]

51:06.480 --> 51:08.187
So, I think I'm gonna get these.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.396
You don't have to spend
your entire

51:12.486 --> 51:13.977
gift certificate today, buddy.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.903
Yeah, but they had
all the ones I wanted.

51:17.491 --> 51:18.607
Bud, you...

51:18.701 --> 51:22.991
Wow, you are listening to
way too much Top 40.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.662
Alright, we gotta get you
some different tapes...

51:29.336 --> 51:31.544
Do you know <i>The Cure?</i>

51:31.630 --> 51:32.871
Or <i>REM?</i>

51:32.965 --> 51:34.456
- Who?
- OK, let's go.

52:21.513 --> 52:22.594
Hey.

52:24.350 --> 52:26.057
You wanna have a drink?

52:26.143 --> 52:27.224
No, I'm good, thanks.

52:30.105 --> 52:31.185
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

52:32.983 --> 52:34.064
No.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.143
Come on, put that water down.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.104
Have a beer
with your old man, come on.

52:41.075 --> 52:42.407
Grab a seat.

52:46.246 --> 52:47.453
There ya go.

52:47.539 --> 52:48.700
Sit down.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.537
Have I ever had a drink
with you before?

52:55.631 --> 52:57.293
No, I don't think so.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.044
Hell, I was 15 when I first
had a beer with my Dad.

53:07.559 --> 53:08.640
Oh, well, cheers.

53:09.770 --> 53:10.886
Cheers, Dad.

53:19.446 --> 53:20.982
You...

53:21.073 --> 53:23.156
took off just as soon
as you could.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.608
You couldn't have...

53:24.702 --> 53:26.159
taken off any faster.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.497
Were you running away
from something?

53:34.128 --> 53:35.460
I wasn't running away, Dad.

53:39.425 --> 53:42.133
I can feel Andrew
drifting away from me.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.046
I don't even know
what to do about it.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.967
Everything was fine
when he was playing football.

53:51.061 --> 53:53.394
I was at every game.

53:54.148 --> 53:55.980
Once he started
to get into the theater,

53:56.066 --> 53:58.433
I just didn't know how
to talk to him anymore.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.232
Well, you can just...

54:02.322 --> 54:04.609
ask him questions about it,
that's a good place to start.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.614
He doesn't think I know
anything about that stuff,

54:08.704 --> 54:10.991
thinks I don't get it.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.617
Maybe he's right, I've...

54:12.708 --> 54:15.325
I've never been an
artsy-fartsy kind of guy anyway.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.421
But I am getting worried.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.967
Does he...

54:25.053 --> 54:26.214
Does he seem soft to you?

54:27.639 --> 54:28.971
He's still a kid, Dad.

54:29.057 --> 54:31.470
But you weren't like him
when you were at his age.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.678
You played sports
all through high school.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.308
You helped me out in the shop.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.685
I mean, Andrew's
gotta be a lot tougher

54:38.776 --> 54:41.314
or he's gonna have
a hard time out in the world.

54:42.571 --> 54:44.233
Your grandfather...

54:44.323 --> 54:45.985
Now he was tough on me.

54:46.074 --> 54:51.069
He didn't hug any of his sons,
or ask us questions.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.618
But he sure knew how to

54:54.708 --> 54:56.995
straighten us out
with discipline.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.953
Or a good ol' ass whoopin
if that's what was called for.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.584
I am who I am today
because of him,

55:02.674 --> 55:04.666
and I turned out alright,
didn't I?

55:05.886 --> 55:06.967
Yeah.

55:17.231 --> 55:19.188
You know you can always
count on me, right?

55:21.235 --> 55:25.525
If something goes wrong,
you need money, anything at all.

55:25.614 --> 55:28.652
We may not have much
but we always pull through.

55:30.202 --> 55:31.409
Hell...

55:31.495 --> 55:33.282
You wouldn't believe
some of the stuff I did

55:33.372 --> 55:36.115
for my buddies in 'Nam,
against them gooks.

55:36.208 --> 55:37.119
Dad, you can't say "gooks."

55:37.209 --> 55:39.166
I can call them
whatever the fuck I want!

55:40.671 --> 55:41.912
You weren't there.

55:44.550 --> 55:47.167
There were people's lives
depending on me.

55:47.261 --> 55:49.924
I've helped so many people.
I'm still known for that,

55:50.013 --> 55:52.676
you ask anyone in town.

55:52.766 --> 55:56.555
I'm the most reliable person
in this town. Ask anyone.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.187
So?

56:06.446 --> 56:07.653
Is everything OK with you?

56:11.577 --> 56:13.409
Come on now,
I don't have all damn night.

56:13.495 --> 56:14.736
Yeah, everything's fine.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.672
How'd you pay for the gifts?

56:29.678 --> 56:30.759
I've already told you guys.

56:31.346 --> 56:32.632
It's a lot of money, Adrian.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.520
I tried to call your office
a few months ago.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.394
Dad, you can't...

56:44.484 --> 56:47.773
You just... If you need to talk
to me you have to call my house.

56:47.863 --> 56:49.399
They don't like personal calls.

56:49.489 --> 56:51.606
I wondered why you wouldn't
give us your work number.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.284
But it didn't take me long
to figure that out.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.161
They said you don't
work there no more.

57:05.339 --> 57:07.331
Well, I'm not sure
who you talked to,

57:07.424 --> 57:10.041
it's a really big agency,
they were probably confused...

57:10.135 --> 57:11.751
Don't lie to me.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.086
What happened?

57:15.140 --> 57:18.349
I mean, did you get fired?
Did you steal something?

57:18.435 --> 57:19.516
Dad!

57:21.980 --> 57:23.346
Well, answer...
Answer my question!

57:25.400 --> 57:27.357
You may be a grown man
but I'm still your father.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.276
OK, I didn't steal anything!

57:31.031 --> 57:32.272
I can't...

57:32.366 --> 57:34.983
Honest... Oh, my God,
I gotta go to bed.

57:35.077 --> 57:37.569
You remember when I was in
Connecticut for Frank's funeral?

57:38.455 --> 57:40.117
He was the commander
of my platoon.

57:40.207 --> 57:41.323
- You remember?
- Yeah.

57:43.251 --> 57:44.492
Well...

57:50.217 --> 57:51.708
They thought he killed himself.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.720
Knowing him he just probably
just got too wasted.

57:57.057 --> 57:58.969
Fooling around
on some shooting range

57:59.059 --> 58:00.675
that he shouldn't have been on.

58:01.603 --> 58:02.639
Stupid son of a bitch.

58:05.983 --> 58:11.854
So I was in Connecticut
for Frank, and then I took...

58:11.947 --> 58:14.439
the train down to the city
to have lunch with you.

58:15.909 --> 58:16.740
Yeah.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.193
I asked if I could
see your place

58:18.286 --> 58:20.824
but you had excuses as to
why that wasn't a good idea.

58:20.914 --> 58:24.078
Dad, I just, didn't want you
to see what a mess it was.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.408
If I'd had time to clean it...

58:25.502 --> 58:27.539
Why are you
still bullshittin' me?

58:32.092 --> 58:33.628
I took a cab
to your neighborhood.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.297
I wanted to see where you lived.

58:45.147 --> 58:48.140
As we drove
past your building...

58:50.193 --> 58:53.106
I thought I saw you with some
guy on the steps

58:53.196 --> 58:55.609
but I wasn't sure at first
if it was you

58:55.699 --> 58:59.613
so I had the cab driver
go around the block again.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.204
This time I...

59:05.125 --> 59:06.286
I was sure it was you.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.668
You had your arms around him.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.508
I didn't even recognize you.

59:25.437 --> 59:26.997
It was like
you were a different person.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.703
Don't you even think
about telling your mother.

59:51.797 --> 59:54.039
You will break her heart.

59:56.635 --> 59:59.548
You hear me? Not one word.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.012
Yes, sir.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.383
Ow!

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.004
Did you cut yourself?
Let me see...

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.555
Yeah... Where are the Band-Aids?

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:45.722
I'll get them.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:11.119
- There.
- I got it.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.409
Why won't you let me help you?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.122
I'm fine, Mom! I'm not a child!

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.020
<i>Adrian?
Somebody's here to see you.</i>

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:44.788
<i>You sure there's nothing
I can get for you, hun?</i>

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.066
<i>Make you some tea or something?</i>

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.530
<i>Oh no, I'm fine, Mrs. Lester.</i>

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.320
<i>Please, call me Eileen.</i>

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:51.989
Where's Mr. Lester?

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.911
He's at the store with Andrew.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.211
Oh, OK.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.209
Ah, our man of the hour.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:01.874
Hey.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.049
Hi.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:09.174
I've got a chicken to put in the
oven so I'll leave you to it.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.849
Say hi to your parents for me

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.663
and let me know if there's
anything I can do.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:13.973
I will, thank you so much.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.180
Alright.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:17.608
Don't be a stranger.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:19.142
I won't.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.273
I'm starving,
do you wanna grab a bite?

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.324
Wow, this place
has not changed a bit.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.116
Remember we used to come here
whenever we were broke

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.953
and we'd order
an extra large order of fries

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:40.379
and get refills on the Coke?

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:43.583
And leave no tip!
We were terrible.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.003
Hi, what can I get for y'all?

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.722
Um, I'll have a Caesar salad
and a Diet Coke.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.893
And I'm just gonna have
a cup of coffee,

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:55.641
cream and sugar.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.482
And we're gonna have an extra
large order of fries to split.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:02.060
OK, perfect.
I'll be right back with that.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.365
I'm really sorry...

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.658
about the other night.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.407
I just don't...

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.097
I don't wanna lose you
as a friend again.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.085
Yeah, me too, Carly, I'm...

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.208
I've really missed you.
I just, um...

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:32.094
I don't know if I'm gonna be
here this time next year.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.638
What do you mean?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.030
Leo passed away two months ago.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.071
In October.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.372
Nine months
after he was diagnosed.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.083
We'd spent every
New Year's Eve together

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.630
since we met.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:08.217
I was really hoping he was
gonna make it to this one.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:15.721
I called his parents up
after he died.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.164
They didn't want
anything to do with him.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:27.811
He really wanted
to be buried in Ohio,

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.442
where he was born.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.148
I wasn't even able
to do that for him.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.492
I've lost so many friends.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.701
I've been to
six funerals this year.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.163
I feel like I'm losing
my fucking mind.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.468
Leo left me his Chihuahua.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.133
It breaks my heart a little bit
when he looks at me funny.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.513
He's still wondering
where Leo is.

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.598
And uh...

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.354
My job at the agency,
I lost that.

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.128
Someone might have found out,
I don't know.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.160
And uh,
I'm working at a restaurant.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:21.123
Barely getting by, I spent all
my money on Christmas gifts.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.620
I can't believe it took you
this long to tell me.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:29.633
Did you really think that

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:31.083
I wasn't gonna be cool
with that?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.177
Yeah.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:37.799
I guess we're even.
You don't really know me either.

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.265
Promise me something.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:47.934
When you get sick,
you have to call me. OK?

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.426
You don't wanna be
anywhere near this.

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.364
Trust me...

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.357
Things are gonna
get really ugly.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.079
I shouldn't have kissed you.
If something happened to you...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.162
Stop it, OK, stop it.
You're being paranoid.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.417
OK?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.416
I'm gonna see you
next Christmas.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.339
We're gonna go out and
we're gonna have a good time.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.394
And who knows,
there might be a cure by then.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.109
There could be new drugs,
new treatments...

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.461
I'm not gonna make it that long.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:22.476
You're still healthy.
You don't even look sick to me.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:47.205
Sorry.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.557
You don't have to
say yes to this.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:06.980
But in the future...

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.272
Would you tell Andrew what
really happened to me?

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:15.855
Please?

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:33.296
Honey, will you do us the honor?

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.170
Uh, yeah sure.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.181
Dear Father...

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:44.429
Um...

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.104
Thank You
for another wonderful meal.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.142
And we wanna thank You

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.979
for allowing us to spend
this Christmas together.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:02.071
We pray that there are many
more days like this to come,

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:05.245
and many more memories
for us to look forward to.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:11.915
And we pray that...

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.917
You'll continue
to teach us how

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:15.623
to love
each other unconditionally,

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.709
just the way that You love us.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.261
We pray that
Your everlasting grace

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:25.307
continues to lead
and inspire us. Amen.

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.474
(All) Amen.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.390
That was lovely.

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.017
Thanks, Mom.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.191
Can't you just
stay a few more days?

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.069
I really wish I could, Andrew,
but I have to get back to work.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.154
So, when are you
gonna come home next?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.986
Um, well...

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.783
The next chance that I get.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:53.460
Better not be
another three years.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.788
I mean, you have a promotion
now, you make money,

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.444
can't you just fly home
whenever you want?

01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.834
Let it go, Andrew.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.609
Hey.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.734
What's going on?

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.121
I'll tell him for you.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.336
I'll tell Andrew.

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:40.966
Thank you, Carly.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.261
Thank you.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.154
<i>I told you
I don't need a new coat.</i>

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.204
<i>Honey, he's leaving soon.
Would you just put it on?</i>

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.329
<i>It's the least you can do.</i>

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:12.577
<i>Would you stop pestering me?</i>

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.954
<i>If you won't put it on for him
then just put it on for me.</i>

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.205
<i>Eileen?</i>

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:17.295
<i>God, you're so stubborn.</i>

01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:21.144
<i>Why don't you just
take it to work with you?</i>

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.800
<i>It's supposed to get cold later.</i>

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.301
I'm sorry
I have to go again, bud.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:30.803
Are you gonna miss me?

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.188
Alright.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.022
Wish I could bring you with me,
but you're just too big.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.197
I gotta go to work early
so your Mom's gonna

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.578
take you to the airport.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:56.533
Alright.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.664
So, I'll say my goodbyes now.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.508
- Take good care of yourself.
- You too, Dad.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.960
I meant what I said.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:09.171
You can always count on me.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.174
OK...

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.268
Hey, Dad.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:14.847
Yeah?

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.152
I was reading through
some passages in the Bible

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:20.519
that you and Mom got me and...

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:26.683
I know I need to
make some changes.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.361
I'm a little lost
right now, but...

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.699
With His light,
I know I can find my way back.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.934
I gotta go.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.186
Alright.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.070
Bye, Dad.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.620
Andrew...

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.616
Andrew?

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.325
Mom?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.498
Is it time?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.076
Yeah, we should get going.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:04.138
OK, I'm just gonna
drop you here.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.103
And I'm...

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:08.900
I'm not gonna walk you in, OK?

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:10.195
OK.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.235
I don't want you
to miss your plane.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.493
You know...

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:30.380
You don't have to tell me,
until you're ready.

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:37.049
And I'll try to be ready
when you are.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.385
[sobbing]
Mom...

01:14:58.285 --> 01:14:59.446
Alright...

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.489
I should probably get going.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.121
OK.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.196
I love you, Mom.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.118
I love you, too.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.977
(Adrian on tape)
<i>Hey, Andrew...</i>

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.521
<i>Now I want you to keep this
tape as long as possible.</i>

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.690
<i>I think you might need to listen
to this again in the future.</i>

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.021
<i>It might make more sense
to you when you're older.</i>

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.399
<i>You're gonna have
some tough days.</i>

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:47.319
<i>Days where...</i>

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.198
<i>You'll feel like
everything sucks.</i>

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.080
<i>And you don't wanna
get out of bed.</i>

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.463
<i>Days where you're gonna feel
like you just don't belong.</i>

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.757
<i>I've had a lot of those days.</i>

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:03.678
<i>And I want you to know...</i>

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.926
<i>You're not the only one who
feels the way that you do.</i>

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:12.389
<i>There's a whole world out there
for someone like you.</i>

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.606
<i>I promise you, you are not as
different as you think you are.</i>

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.439
<i>And Mom and Dad,
they might not get it.</i>

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.105
<i>A lot of your friends
might not get it either.</i>

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.698
<i>And some of them might say some
pretty mean and awful things.</i>

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:30.988
<i>Because they just don't get it.</i>

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:33.949
<i>But I get it.</i>

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:38.586
<i>And I know that you're
gonna learn to be happy...</i>

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.753
<i>with who you are.</i>

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.917
<i>And you may need to be
in another place to be happy.</i>

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.377
<i>And you know what?
That's OK.</i>

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.258
<i>That's why I left home.</i>

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.465
<i>It might seem like the
hardest thing to do at first.</i>

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.135
<i>But it might be
the right thing for you too.</i>

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.020
<i>And in another time...</i>

01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:59.023
<i>At another place...</i>

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.471
<i>You're gonna meet
the right people.</i>

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.197
<i>People that are just like you.</i>

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:09.158
<i>People that are just like me.</i>

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:11.653
<i>So hang in there, Andrew.</i>

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.493
<i>Things tend to
get a little darker</i>

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.949
<i>before they get brighter.</i>

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.753
<i>I will always regret
that I wasn't home enough</i>

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.329
<i>these past few years.</i>

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.127
<i>I feel like I'm only
really getting to know you</i>

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:25.459
<i>this time around.</i>

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.178
<i>And I'm proud
that you're my brother.</i>

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:34.176
<i>I will always be with you.</i>
