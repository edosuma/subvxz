01:36.833 --> 01:38.083
Love surprises.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.166
Love visitors.

01:40.916 --> 01:42.875
A surprise visitor all the more.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.000
-I've had eyes on you for a while.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.041
We're very flattered.

01:49.708 --> 01:51.708
But who is this secret peeper

01:51.791 --> 01:53.375
peeping all our secrets?

01:53.458 --> 01:54.666
I know who you are.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.416
What you are.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.041
You're different to other dopplers.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.916
You're not good-natured or helpful,
are you?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And yet you are here for our help.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.375
Do you not have errand boys
where you come from?

02:19.500 --> 02:21.708
They lacked your valuable set of skills.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.708
-Don't worry.

02:25.791 --> 02:26.791
It's not silver.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.833
We fancy our freedom.

02:32.916 --> 02:35.125
It is not money we thirst for, per se.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.166
There is plenty that you do thirst for.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.833
Assassination on behalf
of the Kingdom of Nilfgaard.

02:43.416 --> 02:47.666
Or perhaps another eye or ear
to round out your artful composition.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.166
We'd planned on wearing this one
for a while.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.875
But we are flexible.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.125
A cell of dimeritium made just for you.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.916
How does it feel
to be neutered of your powers?

03:59.750 --> 04:01.416
I know how you were schooled,

04:02.500 --> 04:03.625
how you were shaped.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.125
This isn't who you are.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.250
The White Flame made me who I am...

04:12.166 --> 04:13.708
gave me a higher purpose.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.166
You could've had that too,

04:16.250 --> 04:19.958
if only you realized
that Cintra had to fall.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.625
I have found his purpose.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
This one?

04:31.375 --> 04:32.541
Do we have to?

05:06.375 --> 05:07.208
Run.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.333
I said run!

05:51.875 --> 05:54.291
Everything you've ever done,

05:55.166 --> 05:56.333
ever debated,

05:57.208 --> 05:58.458
ever dreamed,

05:58.541 --> 06:00.500
is in our head now.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.333
Even this morning,

06:04.208 --> 06:06.750
when you thought to take your life.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.000
He didn't want to be abused.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.125
Incorrect.

06:11.958 --> 06:14.416
He didn't want to be used.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.708
You can't change the world this way.

06:20.791 --> 06:23.250
Only one of us will be alive to find out.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.125
Yeah.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.541
You don't know what you're doing.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.041
You don't know what she is.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.250
She will end up where she belongs.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.333
Would've made a terrible noose.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.041
You're to bring me the girl alive.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.583
So many rules.

07:31.791 --> 07:32.916
Fine.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.125
But it'll cost you.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.791
Children are our favorite.

08:00.541 --> 08:01.916
You're a wee bit shy.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.000
I've never been shy a day in my life.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.041
Count it again.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.666
Times are shifting, my dear.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.708
My rates have gone up
since last we spoke.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.625
I've found more demand for my services.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.583
Then your customers will be
awfully disappointed

08:16.666 --> 08:19.208
when they find a charred spot
where you once stood.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.916
None more so than yourself.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.708
You've come so far already.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.875
Just a few more...

08:27.958 --> 08:29.541
treatments should do the trick.

08:32.875 --> 08:33.875
Isn't it lovely,

08:34.583 --> 08:35.750
the life we've chosen?

08:36.833 --> 08:39.208
Not being bound
by the rules of the Brotherhood.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.125
Living off the grid with no resources.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.541
Mm. It's a dream come true.

08:46.541 --> 08:49.166
Lucky for you, you found your way
to an intolerant kingdom.

08:49.875 --> 08:53.375
For quick coin,
head to the nearest town in any direction.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.000
Your skills will be rewarded.

08:56.083 --> 08:59.208
If it's as you say, then why aren't you
out there taking advantage?

08:59.708 --> 09:00.958
As you're so inclined.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.958
Because my customers...

09:05.833 --> 09:06.666
come to me.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.458
Hm.

09:08.541 --> 09:10.083
I see a lot of myself in you.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.291
Follow my footsteps.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.916
You could gain some repute.

09:15.375 --> 09:18.083
Find a whole new career
to fund what you...

09:18.625 --> 09:20.708
so desperately want.

09:25.416 --> 09:26.708
With mages like us,

09:27.125 --> 09:29.083
word of mouth is paramount.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.583
There is no "us." There's only me.

09:31.666 --> 09:34.166
And I know a thing or two
about stirring word of mouth.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.583
I'd given up altogether.

09:44.666 --> 09:48.458
Love, that's nice,
but not on the cards for me.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.208
Not in my lifetime.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.208
It took me nearly a whole one to find him.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.208
As you can see,
passion is not the trouble.

10:03.416 --> 10:04.416
Our issue...

10:05.333 --> 10:08.750
my... issue is of a mechanical nature.

10:08.833 --> 10:09.666
Hm.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.041
I have just the thing.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.208
Now, be prepared.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.958
The spell should take effect quickly,

10:17.041 --> 10:20.625
and will endure until your lady utters
a handpicked magic word.

10:22.916 --> 10:24.125
Anything come to mind?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.208
Kumquat?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.500
You arrived at that rather quickly.

10:28.083 --> 10:28.916
Kumquat it is.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.375
We'd better go now, <i>schnucki.</i>

11:04.208 --> 11:05.708
What is this...

11:05.791 --> 11:08.416
wretched business here?

11:10.166 --> 11:11.416
Did you not understand the sign?

11:17.375 --> 11:19.208
Are you familiar with who I am?

11:27.166 --> 11:30.125
Well, won't you end this
rather melodramatic suspense and tell me?

11:30.208 --> 11:31.958
He is Beau Berrant.

11:32.041 --> 11:35.041
Perhaps you are not aware
of the rules here?

11:35.125 --> 11:37.583
If you are casting spells,

11:37.666 --> 11:40.083
I need to collect
what's due to the kingdom.

11:41.750 --> 11:45.458
I'm afraid those terms
seem rather shite to me.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.708
I did suspect
you possessed such a predilection.

11:54.625 --> 11:55.708
Though I am less...

11:56.791 --> 11:59.208
burly than your usual type.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.541
We can't trust her.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.958
She hid her identity, her past,

12:15.708 --> 12:17.000
her ties to Cintra...

12:17.458 --> 12:20.041
Shan-Kayan is the only reason
we know who she is.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.208
Ciri was scared.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.708
Perhaps she can't yet trust us.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.291
We still don't know her intent.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.208
She's a girl...

12:29.291 --> 12:31.625
Who possesses the power of a weapon.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.375
In Brokilon, she can be molded.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.458
She can become one of us.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.166
She's <i>not </i>one of us.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.083
Nilfgaardian spies.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.250
Found them searching our border.

12:51.291 --> 12:55.208
Their whole army will arrive.
It's only a matter of time.

12:56.458 --> 12:59.166
What if this girl...

13:00.375 --> 13:01.666
is our only way...

13:02.208 --> 13:03.666
to survive?

13:12.875 --> 13:13.708
Ciri...

13:15.708 --> 13:17.791
...will be allowed to stay.

13:46.916 --> 13:48.333
I don't think they like me.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.708
When Queen Calanthe
closed the borders of Cintra,

13:55.083 --> 13:56.708
it was to protect her people.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.416
The General wants to protect us.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.000
We all make decisions.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.791
The sword of destiny has two edges.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.208
What does that mean?

14:10.291 --> 14:12.083
You must make the choice.

14:12.166 --> 14:16.166
You can stay.
Or you can continue on your search.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.166
What do you want to do?

14:23.625 --> 14:27.333
♪ <i>'Cause you all know</i>
<i>That this bard</i> ♪

14:27.416 --> 14:30.250
<i>♪ Loved ladies from Nilfgaard ♪</i>

14:30.333 --> 14:33.333
<i>♪ 'Cause Nilfgaard can kiss my... ♪</i>

14:33.791 --> 14:34.916
Geralt!

14:35.000 --> 14:35.875
Hello.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.625
What's it been, months? Years?
What is time, anyway?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.500
I heard you were in town.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.041
Are you following me, you scamp?

14:44.875 --> 14:46.333
I mean, I'm flattered and everything,

14:46.416 --> 14:49.000
but you should really think
about getting a hobby one of these days.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.250
Ugh!

14:51.333 --> 14:52.583
Do you want some?

14:52.666 --> 14:55.375
-"How are you doing?" I hear you ask.
-I didn't.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.291
Well, the Countess de Stael,

14:57.375 --> 15:00.375
my muse and beauty of this world,

15:00.458 --> 15:02.041
has left me.

15:02.666 --> 15:05.708
Again. Rather coldly and unexpectedly,
I might add.

15:06.791 --> 15:09.083
I fear I shall die a brokenhearted man.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.000
Or a hungry one, at the very least,

15:12.083 --> 15:15.458
unless somebody fancies sharing a fish
with an old friend?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.416
Oh, are we not using "friend"?

15:19.041 --> 15:21.375
Yeah, sure.
Let's just give it another decade.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.458
Geralt, you're fantastic
at a great many things,

15:24.541 --> 15:26.541
but clearly, fishing is not one of them.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.333
Have you caught anything today?

15:29.166 --> 15:30.875
What are you fishing for, exactly?

15:31.666 --> 15:32.500
Is it cod?

15:33.666 --> 15:34.500
Carp?

15:35.541 --> 15:36.625
Pike?

15:37.041 --> 15:37.875
Bream?

15:37.958 --> 15:39.708
I'm just--
I'm just listing fish that I know.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.083
Zander? Is that a fish?

15:41.166 --> 15:42.208
I'm not fishing.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.208
I can't sleep.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.041
Right. Good.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.916
Well, that-- that makes sense.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.375
Insomuch that it sort of...

15:51.000 --> 15:51.833
doesn't.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.541
What's going on, Geralt? Talk to me.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.375
-A djinn.
- A what?

16:00.875 --> 16:02.291
I'm looking for a djinn.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.458
For a dj-- For a djinn?
A dj-- Like a genie?

16:04.541 --> 16:07.708
The floaty fellas
with the... the bad tempers

16:07.791 --> 16:09.416
and the banned magics,
that kind of genie?

16:09.500 --> 16:11.041
-Yes. It'll grant me wishes.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.291
It's in this lake somewhere.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.833
And I can't fucking sleep!

16:19.166 --> 16:21.458
I don't mean to play priest's ear
or anything,

16:21.541 --> 16:25.375
but has it occurred to you that maybe
we're merely rubbing salve on a tumor?

16:25.458 --> 16:28.583
Not exactly addressing the root cause
of the problem?

16:28.666 --> 16:29.708
Hm?

16:29.791 --> 16:32.208
I mean, maybe, just-- just maybe,

16:32.291 --> 16:34.416
this whole sleeplessness-ness

16:34.500 --> 16:38.291
has got something to do with what
the druid Mousesack said to you in Cintra?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.458
You know, the Law of Surprise?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.125
Destiny?

16:44.250 --> 16:47.166
Being unable to escape the child
that belongs to you, et cetera, et cetera?

16:47.250 --> 16:49.000
No! It's not that.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.291
Yeah, you're probably right.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.166
But what if you're not?

16:56.875 --> 16:59.208
You know, the Countess de Stael
once said to me

16:59.291 --> 17:03.875
that destiny is just the embodiment
of the soul's desire<i> </i>to grow.

17:03.958 --> 17:07.208
-Did you sing to her before she left?
-I did, actually, and she...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.625
Why, what are you implying?

17:11.833 --> 17:13.125
Oh...

17:13.208 --> 17:16.458
We are so having this conversation.
Come on, Geralt. Tell me. Be honest.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.875
How's my singing?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.250
It's like ordering a pie
and finding it has no filling.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.000
You need a nap!

17:31.791 --> 17:35.666
I mean, are you trying
to hurt my feelings, Geralt? It's...

17:36.083 --> 17:39.875
It's down-- downright indecorous of you,
if I'm completely honest, and--

17:39.958 --> 17:42.208
Wow. Wow.
What is-- what is that?

17:43.500 --> 17:44.916
It's a wizard's seal.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.750
-The djinn.
- Do you mind if I--

17:48.250 --> 17:50.541
-Jaskier.
-Take it back about my fillingless pie.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.375
Take it back, you get
your djinny-djinn-djinn.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.958
-Let go.
-No! No, let go, you horse's arse!

17:58.041 --> 17:59.166
Hm.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.458
That's a bit of an anticlimax.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.916
-Or is it?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.625
Djinn, I have freed thee,
and as of this day, I am thy lord.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.208
Firstly, may Valdo Marx,
the troubadour of Cidaris,

18:13.291 --> 18:16.041
be struck down with apoplexy
and die.

18:16.125 --> 18:20.125
Secondly, the Countess de Stael
must welcome me back with glee,

18:20.208 --> 18:23.416
open arms and very little clothing.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.708
-Thirdly--
-Jaskier!

18:24.791 --> 18:25.916
-Wha--
-Stop!

18:26.000 --> 18:28.166
-There are only three wishes.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.541
Oh, come on, you always say
you want nothing from life.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.833
How was I to know
you wanted three wishes all to yourself?

18:32.916 --> 18:35.125
-I just want some damn peace!
-Well, here's your peace!

18:44.583 --> 18:45.583
Geralt...

18:46.041 --> 18:47.541
Geralt... it's the djinn!

19:02.708 --> 19:03.541
Jaskier.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.375
Is there a doctor here?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.958
Yes, yes. Chireadan, the elf healer.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.041
Over there.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.666
A djinn in a bottle?
It's like a fairy tale.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.166
Without the happy ending.
Can you help him?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.708
Oh, dear.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.333
What?

19:42.791 --> 19:45.833
I assure you I have received
the best medical education

19:45.916 --> 19:47.375
right here in Rinde, but...

19:48.416 --> 19:50.416
these injuries are of a magical nature.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.000
I can help with the pain,
but it's a bit like...

19:53.083 --> 19:54.708
Putting salve on a tumor?

19:54.791 --> 19:55.625
No!

19:55.708 --> 19:57.291
His throat was attacked.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.333
If the spell's action isn't halted
as soon as possible,

20:01.416 --> 20:03.833
that damage might be irreversible.

20:03.916 --> 20:05.541
Wha--

20:08.125 --> 20:10.458
And the longer he goes untreated,

20:10.541 --> 20:12.541
the more likely it is to spread.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.500
-He could die.

20:14.583 --> 20:15.750
Fuck! Geralt.

20:15.833 --> 20:16.875
Uh...

20:16.958 --> 20:18.541
Yeah, we won't let that happen.

20:24.916 --> 20:28.416
The medicine should buy him a few hours,
but he needs a magical remedy.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.666
You'll have to take him to another town.

20:31.750 --> 20:32.958
There isn't a mage here?

20:34.833 --> 20:35.750
Uh...

20:36.666 --> 20:38.583
The mayor says they are dangerous.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.166
What aren't you saying?

20:46.041 --> 20:47.166
Tell me.

20:50.041 --> 20:50.875
Well...

20:51.750 --> 20:52.625
there...

20:54.416 --> 20:55.833
there is one mage.

20:56.958 --> 20:57.791
I...

20:58.416 --> 21:00.875
was tasked
with bringing this mage to justice.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.000
But I was unable
to penetrate certain defenses.

21:04.875 --> 21:08.875
The mayor himself has made the catch
and has imprisoned the mage in his house.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.000
That wasn't so fucking hard, was it?

21:11.083 --> 21:12.708
- Be careful.

21:12.791 --> 21:14.541
The mage is powerful and malicious.

21:15.833 --> 21:16.875
And quite cunning.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.458
-I'll go find him.

21:27.333 --> 21:28.625
You like pain.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.083
We get it.

21:34.791 --> 21:36.041
I inflict pain.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.625
My dear,
you still think there's a difference.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.250
It's been too long.

21:43.291 --> 21:44.750
I haven't seen you for years.

21:46.083 --> 21:49.083
Not since you maneuvered your way
onto Aedirn's court.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.083
-Mm.
-I heard that went well.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.250
King Virfuril is fine, I'm sure.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.333
He's dead now.

21:56.541 --> 21:58.000
King Demavend reigns now.

21:59.916 --> 22:03.375
Down south, Fringilla's thrived
in the post that should've been yours.

22:04.291 --> 22:07.458
The rightful heir returned to Nilfgaard
and she's helped him restore peace.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.541
Why are you here?

22:12.833 --> 22:14.666
You remained hidden for a while,

22:16.250 --> 22:17.083
but now,

22:19.166 --> 22:20.541
you're making noise.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.166
You're looking for something.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.833
You're wasting your time.

22:26.916 --> 22:30.541
The so-called mages you're enlisting
will not help you with your problem.

22:31.666 --> 22:35.291
And if you're not careful, you will become
just like them... irrelevant.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.541
You are pure chaos right now.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.125
You want a cure,
and it's making you sloppy.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.208
The Brotherhood left you
to your own devices

22:49.291 --> 22:50.333
once you abandoned Aedirn.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.000
But this behavior,

22:53.541 --> 22:56.083
flaunted in direct conflict
with their agenda,

22:56.166 --> 22:57.791
will not be tolerated.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.250
-They will come after you.
- That's why you're here.

23:01.125 --> 23:02.416
To warn me.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.750
How can I ever repay you?

23:03.833 --> 23:05.333
Don't be petty.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.041
This is on you.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.833
You knew the cost of enchantment.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.541
But I didn't know
what it would mean to me.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.666
What does it mean to you?

23:14.541 --> 23:15.375
Why?

23:15.458 --> 23:17.583
Why do you want a baby?

23:18.125 --> 23:19.750
The Continent is vast.

23:19.833 --> 23:23.166
Just because you don't know of a cure
doesn't mean there isn't one.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.625
It's simply beyond your scope.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.583
It is time to move on.

23:33.541 --> 23:35.041
Return to Aretuza.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.375
No, thank you.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.416
Aretuza might be everything to you,
but I'd rather forget it.

23:42.916 --> 23:45.125
Aretuza is everything to the Continent,

23:45.750 --> 23:47.083
to world order.

23:48.833 --> 23:49.833
I am here

23:50.291 --> 23:53.291
to offer you a chance for redemption.

23:54.125 --> 23:58.041
Aedirn, all of this nonsense,
will be forgiven and forgotten.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.583
You can use your talents
to shape a new generation.

24:02.666 --> 24:03.958
Am I hearing this right?

24:06.041 --> 24:08.416
The great Tissaia wants my help?

24:10.500 --> 24:11.458
What's the matter?

24:12.458 --> 24:13.708
Have you lost your touch?

24:13.791 --> 24:17.416
Only you can be thrown a lifeline
and think that you are saving me.

24:17.833 --> 24:21.041
You're afraid
I'll be everything you could never be...

24:21.833 --> 24:22.875
without you.

24:24.333 --> 24:25.541
Which is the rub.

24:25.625 --> 24:29.500
You only want me to do well
so long as you had your hand in it.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.958
How did we get this way?

24:36.541 --> 24:38.958
I gave you all I could give.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.000
What more do you want?

24:42.416 --> 24:43.416
Everything.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.041
You may go, Rectoress.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.375
I have business to attend to.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.166
-Whoa!

25:11.250 --> 25:12.333
A fee for entrance.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.583
A fee to see the mayor?
This is urgent.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.166
I don't make the rules,

25:17.250 --> 25:20.083
-but money opens all doors.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.333
Hm.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.750
-So it does.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.875
-Whoa!

25:48.500 --> 25:49.833
-Whoa.

25:54.083 --> 25:54.916
Welcome...

25:55.416 --> 25:56.583
to my home.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.583
You're the Mayor of Rinde?

25:59.666 --> 26:01.208
Not exactly what I was expecting.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.166
May-- May--

26:03.916 --> 26:05.875
Sorry, he's in a bad way.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.375
Is there a mage that lives here?

26:08.916 --> 26:11.208
Ah. The apple juice!

26:11.750 --> 26:13.083
She wants some.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.666
And she always gets...

26:16.416 --> 26:17.875
what she wants.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.750
I don't understand. Does he want me
to get him the apple juice?

26:21.833 --> 26:23.083
I don't know.

26:31.125 --> 26:32.083
Oh...

26:32.166 --> 26:33.500
-Good.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.166
The fuck?

26:52.916 --> 26:54.291
Hm.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.541
-Stay.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
I, uh...

27:48.708 --> 27:50.125
brought you apple juice.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.375
And quite a bit more.

27:56.916 --> 27:58.125
You're immune.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.375
You must be the mage.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.625
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

28:02.708 --> 28:03.791
Hm.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.291
Chireadan didn't mention that, uh...

28:08.625 --> 28:10.416
What did he fail to mention?

28:13.666 --> 28:14.958
We need your help.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.333
"We"?

28:21.416 --> 28:23.000
Just a friend, I hope?

28:26.375 --> 28:29.291
Your heartbeat, it's extraordinarily slow.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.833
You're...

28:33.916 --> 28:34.750
a mutant.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.041
A witcher.

28:37.583 --> 28:38.541
Geralt of Rivia.

28:41.958 --> 28:45.625
The famous White Wolf!

28:50.041 --> 28:53.000
I thought you'd have fangs
or horns or something.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.958
I had them filed down.

28:58.416 --> 29:01.125
First time I've seen a witcher up close.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.583
What little spells can you cast
with your hands?

29:10.291 --> 29:12.541
Call it professional curiosity.

29:12.666 --> 29:13.666
Please,

29:14.208 --> 29:16.333
Jaskier here needs immediate attention.

29:16.416 --> 29:18.666
And then, if you'd like,

29:19.416 --> 29:21.750
I'll indulge your curiosity
all night long.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.416
It won't take all night.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.166
But I'm sure we can find a way
to fill the time.

29:28.708 --> 29:30.166
He was attacked by a djinn.

29:31.125 --> 29:31.958
A djinn?

29:34.291 --> 29:35.916
Whatever's wrong with him,

29:36.583 --> 29:37.666
it's spreading.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
Fix it,

29:40.916 --> 29:42.125
and I'll pay you.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.708
Whatever the price.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.291
You'll have to do better than juice.

30:09.875 --> 30:10.708
Ragamuffin!

30:34.000 --> 30:35.708
He's in a deep healing sleep.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.333
How long will he sleep for?

30:39.291 --> 30:40.750
Long enough for you to bathe.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.791
How did you...

30:47.875 --> 30:49.166
Oh, right.

30:50.625 --> 30:51.458
Magic.

30:52.333 --> 30:56.208
And I hardly think bathing in this house
is going to leave me any cleaner.

30:56.291 --> 30:57.333
I insist.

30:58.875 --> 31:02.083
I can not only guess the age and breed
of your horse,

31:02.500 --> 31:03.625
but also its color...

31:04.583 --> 31:05.583
by the smell.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.166
Hm.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.750
Fishing for a djinn
seems an extreme measure

31:17.833 --> 31:19.250
to remedy sleeplessness.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.958
When extreme measures seem reasonable,

31:24.166 --> 31:25.125
yes,

31:25.583 --> 31:27.416
-I'm desperate.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.416
And yet you didn't ask me
to help with that.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.875
Looming death kind of jumped the queue.

31:34.583 --> 31:36.583
Now I'm wondering if I can afford you.

31:37.625 --> 31:40.750
Have I accidentally agreed
to indentured servitude?

31:48.416 --> 31:49.416
Go ahead,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.125
ask about them.

31:51.750 --> 31:52.791
Everyone does.

31:55.375 --> 31:56.875
Everyone else is boring.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.125
Turn around.

32:08.833 --> 32:09.875
Hm.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.083
That's cheating.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.416
Nobody smart plays fair.

32:24.750 --> 32:25.666
Tell me,

32:26.708 --> 32:28.958
are all witchers similarly blessed?

32:32.375 --> 32:33.333
Come now,

32:33.958 --> 32:35.625
-you promised.
-Hm.

32:36.833 --> 32:38.500
I haven't conducted a survey,

32:38.916 --> 32:40.583
but I'd hardly say we're blessed.

32:40.666 --> 32:41.916
Oh, don't be so grim.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.375
You were created by magic.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.375
Our magic.

32:46.458 --> 32:49.041
Thank you.
Made for a magical childhood.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.708
Happy childhoods make for dull company.

32:54.333 --> 32:56.375
Judging by your wrists and your wits,

32:56.833 --> 32:58.833
your childhood was very happy.

32:58.916 --> 33:00.541
But Aretuza fixed you up nicely.

33:01.291 --> 33:02.750
What was your ailment before?

33:03.875 --> 33:04.875
Clubbed foot?

33:06.791 --> 33:07.791
Split ends?

33:13.291 --> 33:16.208
Tell me, are there women
who find this coarseness charming?

33:17.791 --> 33:21.125
Maybe some place where
they find your coin very charming indeed.

33:21.208 --> 33:24.958
Hm. You seem to find coin
pretty charming yourself.

33:25.583 --> 33:28.333
Clearly capitalizing
on the political situation here.

33:28.916 --> 33:32.458
I'm serving the stifled people
of this town.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.291
Filling a need.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.541
-Ever heard of it?
-Hm.

33:36.625 --> 33:39.333
It's fine to fly in the face
of overzealous authority,

33:39.791 --> 33:42.666
but to pretend it's anything other
than making a profit...

33:43.333 --> 33:46.750
And to pretend you're after a djinn
to cure insomnia?

33:47.750 --> 33:48.750
Hmm...

33:50.208 --> 33:52.125
Fortunately for you,

33:52.833 --> 33:55.458
once I've paid for your kind services,

33:56.125 --> 33:57.708
it'll be none of your concern.

33:57.791 --> 33:59.625
Fortunately for you,

34:01.375 --> 34:04.708
I've determined your company
and conversation payment enough.

34:10.666 --> 34:12.166
What's the matter?

34:13.875 --> 34:15.291
Water not suit?

34:24.958 --> 34:26.458
This is a little tight.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.375
I believe I sized you up quite right.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.666
Do you doubt my capabilities?

34:37.750 --> 34:38.750
No.

34:39.541 --> 34:40.916
Just your intentions.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.500
I said some things to him.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.458
He's a...

34:50.041 --> 34:51.000
A friend?

34:52.666 --> 34:54.958
I'd like it not to be
the last thing he remembers.

34:55.916 --> 34:57.666
He won't remember much if he's dead.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.750
It's a joke.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.166
He will survive.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.791
And recover his vocal talents.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.250
Does that satisfy you?

35:09.833 --> 35:11.333
Not in the slightest.

35:11.833 --> 35:14.416
But don't reproach yourself for it,
Yennefer.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.041
I'm not easily satisfied.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.125
It's the sign from the seal.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.000
I'll be taking Jaskier now.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.750
If you wake him before he's healed,

35:44.833 --> 35:46.291
the spell won't take.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.666
That's no way to treat a friend,

35:50.166 --> 35:51.000
Geralt.

35:51.541 --> 35:52.583
You want the djinn,

35:52.958 --> 35:54.416
but the amphora's broken.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.416
The djinn's already long gone.

36:04.791 --> 36:05.791
Do go on.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.833
Tell me how stuff works.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.875
The djinn is tied to this plane
and its master.

36:12.291 --> 36:15.375
How many wishes did the bard express
before he lost his voice?

36:16.625 --> 36:19.958
You need Jaskier to make his last wish
so you can capture it.

36:20.583 --> 36:21.625
So that's...

36:22.041 --> 36:24.166
two... then.

36:24.541 --> 36:26.250
The djinn will fight you.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.125
If you try and bend it--

36:35.250 --> 36:36.166
Ah...

36:36.916 --> 36:38.208
That scent...

36:39.625 --> 36:40.875
Lilac and...

36:40.958 --> 36:41.958
Gooseberries.

36:46.541 --> 36:48.375
Tough to get in your head.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.291
-You have a strong will,

36:52.666 --> 36:54.291
but you can't contend with me.

36:55.916 --> 36:58.666
Sorry I couldn't be direct,
I knew you'd fight it.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.458
And I do love a good old-fashioned trap.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.916
A good old-fashioned...

37:17.583 --> 37:18.416
nap.

37:25.916 --> 37:27.708
<i>Wake up.</i>

37:28.500 --> 37:30.458
-Wake up!

37:35.708 --> 37:36.625
Chireadan.

37:37.541 --> 37:38.541
At long last.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.625
Where are we?

37:56.541 --> 37:58.708
At the spa.
Where do you think we are?

38:00.041 --> 38:01.958
-I hope your rampage was well worth it.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.041
"Rampage"?

38:07.833 --> 38:08.833
What did I do?

38:09.833 --> 38:10.875
Where to begin?

38:13.375 --> 38:14.208
You...

38:15.041 --> 38:17.500
attacked a pawnbroker in his shop,

38:17.583 --> 38:20.333
kicking him in the delicate places.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.208
Hm.

38:22.750 --> 38:26.250
You also dragged the apothecary
into the street,

38:26.333 --> 38:28.708
pulled down his pants
and thrashed his arse with a belt.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.250
Both are on the town council,

38:30.333 --> 38:33.458
who are voting to usurp the mayor
and kick Yennefer out.

38:33.958 --> 38:35.166
Any of this ring a bell?

38:37.958 --> 38:39.416
Like a faded dream.

38:45.666 --> 38:48.125
She had you enact revenge
on her behalf.

38:49.375 --> 38:50.625
I tried to stop you,

38:50.708 --> 38:52.583
but the guards assumed
I was there to abet.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.291
The sentence will be passed
by the very council members you attacked.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.458
It is sure to be death.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.833
I suppose that's one way
of getting some rest.

39:05.291 --> 39:08.125
Why on earth would you enlist
the mage's help after my warning?

39:08.208 --> 39:10.666
It's like you thought the scorpion
were prettier than a spider

39:10.750 --> 39:13.833
-because of its lovely tail.
-You weren't exactly forthcoming.

39:18.791 --> 39:21.583
I admit I could've better prepared you
for Yennefer.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.291
You're under her spell, aren't you?

39:27.291 --> 39:28.791
I wish I was, but no.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.416
It's a simple issue of body chemistry.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.916
You're in love with her?

39:38.583 --> 39:41.750
And I think perhaps
you may understand me.

39:47.083 --> 39:49.708
I thought it would take longer
to build the scaffold.

39:54.708 --> 39:55.875
Ah, fuck.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.583
Here you are.

39:59.666 --> 40:00.791
Remember me?

40:01.958 --> 40:03.958
Did not know you were a witcher.

40:05.208 --> 40:07.708
I've always wanted to play with one.

40:26.041 --> 40:27.291
Oh! Where am I?

40:29.083 --> 40:30.875
Whew! Um...

40:33.916 --> 40:35.166
Right. Good.

40:36.875 --> 40:38.375
Good. Um...

40:39.708 --> 40:40.708
Not to be...

40:41.208 --> 40:42.958
untoward or anything...

40:43.041 --> 40:44.458
but...  ...did we...

40:46.083 --> 40:47.083
you know...

40:48.083 --> 40:49.166
...do the, uh...

40:49.791 --> 40:51.708
Ooh, Go-- Oh, no! No!

40:51.791 --> 40:54.000
Definitely did not butter that biscuit.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.333
Look, I am so sorry,

40:55.416 --> 40:58.166
but I've just remembered
I left my... cat

40:58.250 --> 40:59.291
on the...

41:00.000 --> 41:00.833
stove.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.166
I-- I really must be going.

41:02.250 --> 41:05.083
Express your deepest desires
and you can be on your way.

41:05.166 --> 41:08.833
Well, my deepest desires are
currently satisfied, thank you so much.

41:11.291 --> 41:13.125
-How's your throat?
- Uh...

41:13.583 --> 41:16.000
-Perhaps you should try some scales.
-Uh...

41:16.416 --> 41:18.750
<i>♪ Toss a coin to your witcher</i> ♪

41:18.833 --> 41:20.791
<i>♪ O, Valley of... penis ♪</i>

41:20.875 --> 41:22.875
-Oh, God.
-If you want to keep all you have...

41:24.083 --> 41:26.208
-...make a damn wish.

41:31.583 --> 41:34.958
What's the difference
between a witcher and a tub of dung?

41:39.291 --> 41:41.125
Ah, I know that one.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.166
What is repulsive,

41:51.375 --> 41:52.250
deviant...

41:53.291 --> 41:55.083
...and cannot smell?

41:56.833 --> 41:58.083
A witcher without a nose.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.958
-Last words, Witcher.

42:04.583 --> 42:05.750
Make them good.

42:10.041 --> 42:12.625
I want you to burst,
you son of a whore.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.166
You are the one with the wishes.

42:39.708 --> 42:42.250
- Make your wish!

42:42.916 --> 42:44.250
Do it now!

42:44.333 --> 42:46.250
I don't-- I don't know! I...

42:46.333 --> 42:49.708
I wish very badly
to leave this place forever.

43:25.750 --> 43:28.750
Oh, Geralt. Thank the gods.
I might live to see another day.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.000
We need to go.

43:30.083 --> 43:31.750
Jaskier, you're okay.

43:32.250 --> 43:34.250
I'm glad to hear
that you give a monkey's about it.

43:34.333 --> 43:35.875
Let's not jump to conclusions.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.375
What happened?

43:37.458 --> 43:40.666
Well, I was having a rather lovely dream
which then turned into a nightmare.

43:40.750 --> 43:42.333
There were naked women in both parts.

43:42.416 --> 43:44.375
The first one was loving,
tender, very generous.

43:44.458 --> 43:46.541
The second, significantly more terrifying.

43:46.666 --> 43:47.875
Tell me about the second one.

43:47.958 --> 43:51.750
Well, black hair, devilish eyes,
was painting an amphora on her abdomen.

43:51.833 --> 43:52.833
You know, the usual.

43:53.416 --> 43:54.916
She wants to be the vessel.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.833
What, you know this woman?
Of course you know this woman.

43:58.208 --> 44:00.125
She wants to become more powerful.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.333
But she'll die.

44:03.791 --> 44:06.833
Well, let's pray for her
on our way out of town.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.541
Oh...

44:12.500 --> 44:15.208
Are you perhaps short of a marble?

44:16.750 --> 44:18.500
You have to go in there, don't you?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.083
I recognize the look.
I know how you feel.

44:22.041 --> 44:23.625
You're making me uncomfortable.

44:24.041 --> 44:26.791
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Do not tell me
that this is finally the moment

44:26.875 --> 44:29.666
you've decided to actually care
about someone other than yourself?

44:29.750 --> 44:34.250
Leave the very sexy but insane witch
to her inevitable demise!

44:34.333 --> 44:36.958
She saved your life, Jaskier.
I can't let her die.

44:44.083 --> 44:44.958
Don't!

44:47.916 --> 44:49.083
I'm here to help you.

44:51.041 --> 44:52.666
I don't need your help.

44:53.083 --> 44:54.333
You're free.

44:54.416 --> 44:55.875
No longer under my spell.

44:57.250 --> 44:58.208
And yet,

44:58.625 --> 44:59.875
here I am.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.208
You seem to want to meet your end.

45:06.208 --> 45:07.291
As do you.

45:09.375 --> 45:11.000
The djinn isn't weakening.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.083
The bard expressed his last wish,

45:13.166 --> 45:14.500
-but it's...

45:14.583 --> 45:16.291
It's getting stronger!

45:16.375 --> 45:17.291
Go!

45:17.375 --> 45:19.333
That's because I'm the one
with the wishes.

45:22.750 --> 45:23.625
You?

45:25.333 --> 45:27.708
You're the djinn's master?

45:30.541 --> 45:31.458
Yeah.

45:31.541 --> 45:34.000
-Well, what are you waiting for?

45:34.083 --> 45:35.500
Make your wishes!

45:37.458 --> 45:40.041
Becoming the vessel for the djinn
will have you lose control,

45:40.500 --> 45:41.958
-not gain it!

45:42.041 --> 45:44.250
Can't you see what this is doing to you?

45:44.666 --> 45:46.625
True transformation is painful.

45:46.708 --> 45:48.041
Release the djinn!

45:48.541 --> 45:50.041
I'll give you my last wish!

45:50.625 --> 45:52.208
You heroic protector...

45:53.250 --> 45:54.458
...noble dog,

45:54.541 --> 45:56.875
permitting my success
so long as you command it yourself.

45:56.958 --> 45:58.500
Fuck off!

45:58.583 --> 46:00.291
-I'll do this myself!

46:00.375 --> 46:02.541
Damn it, Yennefer!
Tell me what you want!

46:02.625 --> 46:05.458
I want everything!

46:16.708 --> 46:19.583
-Sir, what's going on in that house?
-My house. And...

46:20.083 --> 46:21.250
I have no idea!

46:27.791 --> 46:30.875
Make your wish!
You can have anything you want!

46:31.291 --> 46:33.416
You could choose not to be a witcher.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.250
What do you desire?

46:36.041 --> 46:37.208
Immortality?

46:37.833 --> 46:38.791
Riches?

46:39.458 --> 46:40.416
Fame?

46:41.250 --> 46:42.083
Power?

46:51.583 --> 46:53.083
I wish...

47:11.958 --> 47:14.541
The djinn...

47:14.625 --> 47:16.166
- Wh--

47:16.250 --> 47:18.416
-Where did it go?

47:52.750 --> 47:54.500
Are you sure they were up there?

47:55.166 --> 47:56.541
This can't be happening.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.208
This can't be happening.

48:01.875 --> 48:03.583
She could not have survived it.

48:06.041 --> 48:08.750
Why did Geralt go in there?
It doesn't make any sense.

48:10.208 --> 48:12.833
What, to save a mad fucking witch? Why?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.625
Because she was magnificent.

48:29.208 --> 48:30.083
Yennefer?

48:39.333 --> 48:40.333
Yennefer.

48:42.291 --> 48:44.500
It's me... <i> </i>Geralt.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.583
-I know who you are.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.541
What did you do?

48:56.458 --> 48:57.958
You stopped me, didn't you?

48:59.958 --> 49:01.125
I nearly had it.

49:01.708 --> 49:02.833
You had shit all.

49:02.916 --> 49:03.833
I saved your life!

49:03.916 --> 49:05.166
And I saved yours!

49:05.583 --> 49:06.833
You let the djinn escape.

49:06.916 --> 49:09.625
Who knows what havoc it'll wreak
now that it has no vessel at all?

49:09.708 --> 49:11.000
No more havoc than you.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.541
Djinns are only dark creatures
when held captive.

49:13.625 --> 49:15.083
How can you be so sure?

49:17.875 --> 49:20.375
When did you last feel happy
when you felt trapped?

49:22.250 --> 49:24.000
And if you were going
to portal us to safety,

49:24.083 --> 49:26.041
you could've taken us
out of this shit town!

49:26.125 --> 49:28.500
A fine critique
if you could make a portal yourself.

49:28.583 --> 49:30.750
It wasn't a shit town,
it was fine till you came along.

49:30.833 --> 49:31.875
I had a plan!

49:31.958 --> 49:35.000
And that was going swimmingly!

49:35.083 --> 49:36.083
It was.

49:38.250 --> 49:39.500
Like a drowning fish.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.458
What am I supposed to do now, hm?

50:20.458 --> 50:22.375
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

50:24.291 --> 50:25.541
I'm gonna write you...

50:26.291 --> 50:28.041
the best song...

50:29.333 --> 50:31.333
so that everyone remembers
who you were,

50:32.625 --> 50:33.791
what we did,

50:34.916 --> 50:36.041
everything we saw.

50:37.666 --> 50:38.750
And I will sing it...

50:40.250 --> 50:41.625
for the rest of my days.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.708
He always said
I had the most wonderful singing voice.

50:49.375 --> 50:50.500
They're alive.

50:52.875 --> 50:53.708
Bollocks.

50:58.583 --> 50:59.416
Geralt?

51:08.916 --> 51:10.166
Oh, they're alive.

51:13.250 --> 51:15.250
They're really alive! Whoo!

51:16.500 --> 51:17.500
-I mean, he...
-Come on.

51:17.583 --> 51:18.416
Whoa, hang on!

51:24.625 --> 51:25.958
I was right about you.

51:26.916 --> 51:28.708
You do know something of pleasure.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.791
Fleeting,

51:31.541 --> 51:33.291
but highly effective, I'll admit.

51:34.291 --> 51:36.000
I was right about you too.

51:37.125 --> 51:38.208
Which part?

51:41.375 --> 51:43.625
There was a number of things.
Which part?

51:43.708 --> 51:44.708
Doesn't matter.

51:46.500 --> 51:48.000
My plan worked.

51:49.208 --> 51:50.458
There was no plan.

51:51.875 --> 51:53.833
You were making it up
as you went along.

51:54.458 --> 51:55.708
Any fool could see.

52:00.083 --> 52:01.291
What did you wish for?

52:04.708 --> 52:05.708
Tell me.

52:07.000 --> 52:07.833
Geralt?

52:25.125 --> 52:26.791
Weapons, weapons...

52:40.666 --> 52:42.083
Someone's coming.

52:44.708 --> 52:46.208
Stop, please!

52:48.500 --> 52:50.000
I've come for the girl.

53:24.875 --> 53:26.208
You try.

53:33.791 --> 53:35.541
Who enters our forest?

53:36.166 --> 53:38.333
He claims he knows the child.

53:39.125 --> 53:41.000
-Mousesack!
- Your Highness.

53:41.083 --> 53:42.541
What are you doing, silly?

53:46.708 --> 53:50.583
Dara, this is Mousesack. He's known me
since I was born. He's like...

53:51.208 --> 53:52.208
Like family.

53:52.291 --> 53:53.958
What happened to you?

53:54.625 --> 53:56.291
Where did you go on that street?

53:57.208 --> 53:59.458
What matters is
I've found my way back to you.

54:00.625 --> 54:03.291
I've come to take you
to your rightful place.

54:04.291 --> 54:06.500
Ciri has chosen to stay with us.

54:07.208 --> 54:09.958
It was her grandmother's dying wish

54:10.666 --> 54:13.041
that she should go to Geralt of Rivia.

54:15.666 --> 54:17.208
I know where to find him.

54:17.291 --> 54:20.000
She's been promised to him
through the Law of Surprise.

54:37.416 --> 54:39.125
You've been so kind to me,

54:40.958 --> 54:43.583
but Mousesack is all I have left of home.

54:45.125 --> 54:46.708
- Maybe...

54:47.708 --> 54:49.583
he's the other edge of my destiny.

54:52.916 --> 54:54.291
And you can come with us.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.708
Are you sure about leaving?

54:57.333 --> 54:58.458
I need answers.

54:59.333 --> 55:01.000
And I need you.

55:01.791 --> 55:03.625
You're my family too now, remember?

55:11.625 --> 55:13.416
The burden of power...

55:14.791 --> 55:15.958
can be painful.

55:17.958 --> 55:18.958
Be vigilant.

55:20.041 --> 55:22.458
Always ask the right questions.

55:24.541 --> 55:25.958
Your destiny is...

55:26.916 --> 55:29.916
in your own hands and no one else's.

55:38.000 --> 55:38.916
Farewell,

55:40.666 --> 55:41.708
special one.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.208
Thank you.

55:49.875 --> 55:50.875
For everything.

56:05.958 --> 56:06.958
Bye.
