00:02.000 --> 00:10.360
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.560
Ha-ha-ha!

00:11.560 --> 00:13.040
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:13.040 --> 00:15.520
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.480
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.480 --> 00:21.760
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.760 --> 00:24.360
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:27.440 --> 00:29.480
Hello! Ha-ha-ha!

00:30.680 --> 00:33.760
Well, it's my son Dermot
and Maria's wedding this week...

00:33.760 --> 00:35.680
Everybody's so excited.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.920
Cathy is worried about fitting
into that dress so she's going to
her aerobics.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.760
Yeah, aero...
that's a made-up name.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.120
I think the gym owners said,
"We'd better call it something fancy,

00:46.120 --> 00:49.520
"cos they won't pay if we just call
it feckin' jumping up and down."

00:49.520 --> 00:53.040
LAUGHTER

00:53.040 --> 00:54.760
Ow!

00:54.760 --> 00:58.200
Sorry...a bit distracted,
it's not just the wedding,

00:58.200 --> 01:00.320
it's Dermot's reaction to it.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.800
Dermot doesn't take stress well.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.400
When his father died, he went into
the wardrobe in his bedroom
and didn't come out for two weeks!

01:07.400 --> 01:08.920
Hiya, Mammy.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.240
Hello, son.
Would you like a cup of tea?

01:11.240 --> 01:12.760
Yeah, Mammy.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.320
A penny for your thoughts, love. Just
thinking about me getting married!

01:18.320 --> 01:19.840
Do you see what I mean?

01:21.160 --> 01:26.560
My God, it's hard to believe
you'll soon have children of your own
to worry about.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.280
And after the way you treated me,
I hope they break your feckin' heart!

01:31.280 --> 01:33.880
Do you remember
being pregnant on me?

01:33.880 --> 01:35.760
Ha-ha. Do I remember?

01:35.760 --> 01:37.360
I'll never forget it, son.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.240
Me arse was as wide as the
arrivals gate in Dublin Airport!

01:40.240 --> 01:42.120
LAUGHTER

01:42.120 --> 01:47.440
What were you hoping I'd be?
Your father's!
LAUGHTER

01:47.440 --> 01:48.480
Seriously?

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
Don't be a feckin' idiot,
of course not!

01:50.480 --> 01:53.960
Your arrival was a big event
in my life. I'll never forget it...

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
12 pounds, 8 ounces you were.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.120
They couldn't even
get you with the forceps.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.480
At one point I thought they were
going for a tow truck and a rope!

02:03.040 --> 02:04.360
22 stitches I had.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.080
I could walk down both sides of
Grafton Street at the same time.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.800
LAUGHTER

02:10.800 --> 02:13.000
I'll never forget it.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.440
A beautiful, sunny Tuesday! Saturday!

02:15.440 --> 02:17.120
Saturday! Saturday, yeah!

02:17.120 --> 02:18.400
In July.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.680
September. September, yeah!

02:20.680 --> 02:24.680
Which feckin' one are you?
LAUGHTER

02:24.680 --> 02:28.720
No, it was lovely and the
nurses in Galway were so nice.
I thought I was born in Dublin.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.880
No, Galway. It would have been Dublin
only your father wanted
to stay for the last race!

02:32.880 --> 02:35.600
I don't think I'm ready
to be a parent.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.080
For feck's sake, son,
none of us are!

02:38.080 --> 02:39.360
Any parent will tell you.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.480
You're an amateur parent
with an amateur child,

02:43.480 --> 02:45.480
and just when you
have the job right...

02:47.120 --> 02:49.760
..they marry someone and leave.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.920
Yeah, well...

02:51.920 --> 02:55.640
Mammy, don't worry,
I'll never be far away.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.440
Don't you feckin' threaten me, son!

02:57.440 --> 03:01.000
LAUGHTER

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Good morning! Morning, Rory!
Morning, Mammy! Hello, love!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.680
Dermot, getting nervous yet?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.800
Stop, stop it! Leave me alone!

03:07.800 --> 03:12.200
Rory, have you and Dino decided
which girls you're going to be
bringing to the wedding?

03:14.080 --> 03:18.320
Er, no. Listen, I have to dash.
I'll see you later. Bye-bye!

03:19.640 --> 03:20.840
He's in a feckin' hurry!

03:20.840 --> 03:23.880
Mammy, Rory's not bringing
a girl to the wedding. Why not?

03:23.880 --> 03:25.800
Mammy,
what if I turn out like me dad?

03:25.800 --> 03:28.160
You and Rory need to talk.
He's not into women.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.000
What are you saying? I said,
"What if I turn out like me dad?"

03:31.000 --> 03:32.400
No, not you, love, Cathy.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.520
I heard what you said! You won't.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.520
Rory is...a friend of Dorothy's.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.360
LAUGHTER

03:40.360 --> 03:43.760
Can't he bring Dorothy
to the wedding, then?
LAUGHTER

03:43.760 --> 03:45.320
Wouldn't that be all right?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.920
I have to go.
Mammy, we'll talk later.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.520
What if I become an alcoholic?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.320
Your father wasn't an alcoholic.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.600
We couldn't afford that.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.240
He was a drunk!

03:58.240 --> 04:01.320
LAUGHTER

04:03.960 --> 04:06.120
Yeah, I know what you mean, yes.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.520
Well, marriage is not just all
about sex. Now that's what I say.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.680
Yes... Oh, you're so right!

04:13.680 --> 04:16.120
Oh, listen,
I remember when one night himself...

04:16.120 --> 04:21.560
oh, he went...he went from
one o'clock in the morning
till quarter past two!

04:21.560 --> 04:24.520
Yeah. No, well, it was the night
that the clocks went forward!

04:24.520 --> 04:27.320
LAUGHTER

04:27.320 --> 04:30.000
Mammy, for God's sake!
Oh, hold on. What, Cathy?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.640
Just order the pizza!

04:32.640 --> 04:35.760
LAUGHTER

04:37.320 --> 04:38.560
So that's a...

04:38.560 --> 04:43.640
a deep pan Hawaiian, a pepperoni
and a side order of garlic bread.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.280
All right, thank you!

04:50.360 --> 04:52.600
Mammy, sit down for a second.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.200
What, Cathy?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.080
Look at this.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.560
I want you to take
a little time to read this.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.360
What is it?

05:00.360 --> 05:02.520
Homosexuality And Me.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.960
I want you to read it, Mammy.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.040
I want you to look around you for
signs and then we'll have a talk.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.040
Signs? What kind of signs?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.960
Read it...and then we'll talk.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.200
I wish you'd tell me
what this is all about.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.440
LAUGHTER

05:21.440 --> 05:22.920
G'day, g'day!

05:22.920 --> 05:24.440
Hello, son!

05:24.440 --> 05:26.480
Oh, do you smell wedding cake?

05:26.480 --> 05:29.480
I smell wedding cake! Do you
smell wedding cake? Don't, Mammy.

05:29.480 --> 05:33.040
Maria standing there in a beautiful
white gown, think about that!

05:33.040 --> 05:34.920
Stop, Ma, not now!

05:34.920 --> 05:36.480
I'm only getting excited.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.320
I'd love to be a feckin' kangaroo.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.480
I'd have had 12 children
if I could have matured
them in me handbag!

05:48.600 --> 05:51.360
Do you want a cup of tea, love?
No, thanks, Ma.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.000
I'm fine, it's just...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.040
everything's happening so fast.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.280
I feel...

05:57.320 --> 05:59.440
Doesn't matter. Never mind.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.240
I can't believe your boss
made you hop around
the week you're getting married!

06:03.240 --> 06:06.240
He didn't ask me, I wanted to.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.880
I'm going for me bath.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.160
Make sure to wash your Joey!
SHE LAUGHS

06:12.160 --> 06:16.040
Dermot! Can I just say something?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.560
SHE CLICKS LIKE SKIPPY

06:19.320 --> 06:21.040
I'm off, Mammy!

06:21.040 --> 06:22.920
I'll see you, love.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.600
And, Mammy, read the book! I will.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.120
How are you, Mrs Brown?
Is Dermot here?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.160
Dermot!

06:33.160 --> 06:35.840
There's a gobshite
down here looking for you!

06:35.840 --> 06:37.240
LAUGHTER

06:37.240 --> 06:38.840
And me!

06:38.840 --> 06:42.520
LAUGHTER

06:42.520 --> 06:44.240
So how's your speech coming along?

06:44.240 --> 06:47.240
I'm still trying to
pronounce me haitches more.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.000
Your best man's speech
for the wedding!

06:54.000 --> 06:57.200
The best man's speech
is the highlight of the reception!

06:57.200 --> 06:58.680
Really?!

06:58.680 --> 07:01.400
You didn't know you'd to
make a speech at the wedding?!

07:01.400 --> 07:02.480
No.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.120
I suppose I'll just make something
up on the day. No, you won't!

07:08.280 --> 07:12.520
Jacko was our best man and he did
that and loads of crap came out.

07:12.520 --> 07:17.480
You will not. You'll write a speech
before the wedding and you'll run it
past me first. Are we clear? Yeah!

07:17.480 --> 07:21.280
I'd die if Dermot's marriage
was a repeat of my own.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.440
That man feckin' ruined our wedding!

07:31.400 --> 07:32.960
Right, Mrs Brown...

07:32.960 --> 07:35.440
will you tell Dermot
to follow me down to Foley's?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.320
I've some thinking to do.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.680
Yes, you have.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.880
LAUGHTER

07:47.880 --> 07:49.320
Holy God!

07:53.640 --> 07:55.600
Cathy's a lesbian.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.280
LAUGHTER

07:58.280 --> 07:59.720
What?!

07:59.720 --> 08:01.480
Cathy.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.480
It explains a lot. She's a lesbian!

08:04.480 --> 08:06.400
But what about Mick the boyfriend?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.920
He must be a lesbian, too!

08:10.240 --> 08:11.880
Mick is a homo?

08:11.880 --> 08:14.120
Winnie, the book says
you can't say that.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.920
It's not politically correct.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.080
What do you say, then?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.640
I don't know. Queer, I think.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.280
Right so!

08:21.280 --> 08:25.240
Now goodnight, folks. Come on.
You got no homes to go to?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.760
Agnes, what does the book say
is the signs of being a lesbian?

08:30.560 --> 08:34.640
"There will be a noticeable
absence of men in her life."

08:34.640 --> 08:37.120
That's very vague, Agnes.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.160
Sure, your husband's dead
and my Jacko's always in hospital!

08:40.160 --> 08:42.920
Jesus, that's true!

08:42.920 --> 08:44.520
Well, here...

08:44.520 --> 08:47.760
"The closest person to her will be
another woman

08:47.760 --> 08:52.320
"and it will become apparent
that she feels she cannot
be without that woman."

08:52.320 --> 08:54.640
Again, Agnes, that could be anyone.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.720
Sure, that could be me or you!

09:06.760 --> 09:08.200
What does the book say...

09:09.360 --> 09:12.000
..lesbians do together?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.440
Does it mention bingo?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.200
We'd better move. Yeah!

09:31.760 --> 09:37.280
I'm going to go home, ring Jacko
at the hospital, and have phone sex.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.240
LAUGHTER

09:39.240 --> 09:41.280
He'll be asleep, for God's sake!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.480
Well, I'll leave a message then.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.040
LAUGHTER

09:45.040 --> 09:48.640
Listen, I'm going to pay Mr Foley
for the drink he's leaving
at the house.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.640
Right. You go on ahead.
Goodnight then, love. Goodnight.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.840
Goodnight, love. Yeah.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.080
Mr Foley. Hello. That's the stuff
we need and there's a few bob.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.240
Two dozen lager, two dozen stout,
case of wine, assorted spirits...

10:05.240 --> 10:08.360
half a dozen Babycham? Rory! Oh...

10:08.360 --> 10:10.560
I'll tot it up! Thanks very much.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.160
What about this? Jesus Christ!

10:16.040 --> 10:18.000
You were that close to death!

10:19.760 --> 10:23.320
Ahem. "What is the story,
everybody?"

10:23.320 --> 10:25.000
No, no... that's,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.840
"Ladies and gentleman
and Reverend Father..."

10:29.960 --> 10:31.640
It's his best man's speech. Oh!

10:31.640 --> 10:34.480
"Ladies and gentlemen
and Reverend Father...

10:35.880 --> 10:38.840
"..the first time me
and Dermot went shoplifting..."

10:38.840 --> 10:39.880
Scratch that!

10:39.880 --> 10:42.120
LAUGHTER

10:42.120 --> 10:43.920
My Dermot never went shoplifting!

10:43.920 --> 10:46.200
He did!

10:47.680 --> 10:49.000
Of course he didn't...

10:50.600 --> 10:52.120
What about this?

10:53.280 --> 10:57.240
"Me and Dermot met in a private
school..." Yeah, that's nice!

10:57.240 --> 11:00.800
"..recommended by a judge."
LAUGHTER

11:00.800 --> 11:05.360
NO! It's funny but, isn't it?
No! It's not funny!

11:05.360 --> 11:07.160
What did Dermot think of this effort?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.320
He didn't come down to Foley's.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.600
I tried to call him
but his phone's turned off.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.600
Good luck!

11:13.600 --> 11:16.200
It doesn't take two and a half hours
to have a bath.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.120
Maybe he went out to Maria's.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.400
Thanks very much, Mr Foley.
There you go.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.040
Huh, kids. What are you going to do,
hey?

11:24.040 --> 11:27.640
Hey. Well, with our Nicole we're
really lucky. Ah, that's nice.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.920
No, no, she's good as gold...
I'll tell you now, hey,
Josh and Oliver...

11:31.920 --> 11:35.000
Mr Foley...
Agnes fuckin' bored now. Goodnight!

11:38.160 --> 11:40.080
KNOCKING

11:40.080 --> 11:43.000
Is there anything I can do?
Anything that will cheer you up?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.400
No! Just leave me alone, Mammy!

11:45.400 --> 11:48.960
You don't have to get married!
I want to! Then what's wrong?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.920
I just need to think.

11:50.920 --> 11:55.000
That's what you said when your
father died. You didn't come out
for two feckin' weeks!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.360
And we don't have two weeks, Dermot.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.240
Hiya, Mammy!

12:01.240 --> 12:02.920
Dermot's in the cupboard again!

12:04.000 --> 12:05.200
KNOCKING

12:05.200 --> 12:07.680
Hiya, Dermot! Hiya, Cathy.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.880
Do you want tea? No, thanks.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.960
Do you want tea, Mammy? Yes,
I've made some. It's on the table.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.240
You're breaking your mother's heart!

12:18.560 --> 12:22.240
LAUGHTER

12:27.400 --> 12:29.400
KNOCK ON DOOR

12:29.400 --> 12:32.320
Dermot?

12:32.320 --> 12:35.000
The man is here
about the wedding video!

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
LAUGHTER

12:38.000 --> 12:40.960
Mammy, did you read the book?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.640
Yes. Well? Is it you?

12:43.640 --> 12:45.920
What?! No. For God's sake, Mammy!

12:45.920 --> 12:50.160
Well, I've been looking for signs
but everywhere I look, I see signs!

12:50.160 --> 12:52.360
Listen...

12:52.360 --> 12:56.400
"Many people will have a homosexual
experience while in prison."

12:56.400 --> 12:58.680
Dermot was in prison.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.800
Is that why he's in the cupboard?
So he can...

13:01.800 --> 13:04.880
"Come out"?

13:04.880 --> 13:07.440
Mammy! No, it's not Dermot.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.480
Well, now,

13:08.480 --> 13:15.800
"The homosexual will try
on many occasions to give
the family hints or signs."

13:15.800 --> 13:18.480
You gave me the book.
Are you sure it's not you?

13:18.480 --> 13:21.680
No! If it was me, I'd tell you!

13:21.680 --> 13:23.560
There you are.
It's not you or Dermot,

13:23.560 --> 13:26.760
I know it's not Mark, and Trevor's
celibate. Which only leaves?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.000
It's me!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.560
LAUGHTER

13:31.560 --> 13:32.600
Waaah!

13:33.800 --> 13:38.360
No, it's not you, Mammy!
For God's sake. Thank Jesus!

13:38.360 --> 13:39.920
Think about who you left out.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.160
Rory?! Exactly.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.360
Don't be ridiculous. If it was Rory,
he'd have tried to tell me.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.400
Hiya, Agnes, love.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.880
Sit down, Winnie.
I want to tell you something.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.960
Jesus, Agnes. What's wrong?

14:03.960 --> 14:05.920
Rory is homosexual.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.560
I know, but what's wrong?

14:07.560 --> 14:09.720
LAUGHTER

14:09.720 --> 14:11.520
What do you mean, you feckin' know?!

14:11.520 --> 14:13.360
Agnes, everyone knows!

14:13.360 --> 14:15.000
Why didn't you
say that in the pub?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.560
Cos I thought you were
looking for lesbians!

14:17.560 --> 14:19.440
Feckin' idiot.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.880
"Even the police who
arrested us love Dermot..."

14:24.880 --> 14:26.040
Get out! Out!

14:27.240 --> 14:30.040
Here, Do you want me to do
anything for the wedding, pet?

14:30.040 --> 14:32.920
No, no, we're all set.
It'll be a great day, Agnes! Yeah.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.360
Even though you are losing Dermot.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.800
Another one gone, what?

14:39.040 --> 14:41.160
Look, I should go.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.560
I have to get across to the hospital
with them clothes for Jacko.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.240
He's coming out for the wedding!
Of course he is.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.480
Everything's free!

14:50.560 --> 14:53.400
You know, I have to get
two buses across to that hospital.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.200
Two buses over and two buses back?
Four buses? Yeah!

14:56.200 --> 14:58.800
Twice a day? Eight buses.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
Seven days a week, fifty six buses!

15:01.360 --> 15:04.160
Yeah! If the man had any decency,
he'd fuckin' die!

15:04.160 --> 15:06.400
Agnes!
LAUGHTER

15:06.400 --> 15:08.440
I'm only joking!

15:10.920 --> 15:13.280
It's not a bypass he needs,
it's a bus pass!

15:13.280 --> 15:15.720
LAUGHTER

15:15.720 --> 15:17.920
Well,
thank God he's coming home tomorrow!

15:17.920 --> 15:20.440
Yes. I'll tell the bus company,

15:20.440 --> 15:22.760
they can let some staff go!

15:27.920 --> 15:30.000
So, Father...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.040
busy?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.280
Well, er...

15:32.280 --> 15:34.960
No, not too bad.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.600
This time of year tends
to be quiet. Oh!
DOORBELL RINGS

15:37.600 --> 15:39.160
It's open!

15:40.880 --> 15:42.720
I'm so sorry I'm late, Mrs Brown...

15:42.720 --> 15:45.400
Oh, hello, Father Quinn.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.800
Where's Dermot?
Yes, Mrs Brown, where IS Dermot?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.560
He's in the cupboard!

15:50.560 --> 15:54.360
The cupboard? Are you OK, Dermot?

15:54.360 --> 15:56.240
Yes, love!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.800
Right, then...

15:58.920 --> 16:01.480
let's begin.
But the groom is in the cupboard.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.040
How can we have a pre-marriage
talk with him in there?

16:04.040 --> 16:06.080
Did you hear that, Dermot? Yes!

16:06.080 --> 16:08.160
He can hear you, Father. Go ahead!

16:08.160 --> 16:09.240
Well...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.800
You two, having declared
your intention to marry,

16:13.800 --> 16:17.240
will be asked on the wedding day
to make certain vows,

16:17.240 --> 16:22.000
now, not just to each other
but to the Lord Almighty himself.
Now, do you understand this?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.160
Yes. What vows?

16:24.160 --> 16:28.000
Well, to bring your children up
as strong and Christian soldiers.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.320
Are we expecting a war, Father?
LAUGHTER

16:31.320 --> 16:35.680
And you know the church's stance
on contraception and divorce?

16:35.680 --> 16:37.840
Yes, and you need to cop on.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.440
Look, Father, if you don't play the
game, don't make the feckin' rules!

16:44.960 --> 16:47.200
Mrs Brown!

16:47.200 --> 16:50.680
Father, marriages aren't made in
heaven, they're made here in Finglas,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.880
or in Birmingham,
or Liverpool, or New York.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.480
And it's tough.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.480
You fight with each other,
you love each other

16:58.480 --> 17:02.000
and sometimes you'll feckin' hate
each other. But with God's help...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.360
Ah, "With God's help..."

17:03.360 --> 17:06.040
God'll help you stay sane,
the rest is up to you!

17:06.040 --> 17:08.840
It's about respect
and learning to love!

17:08.840 --> 17:12.280
Yes, and children! Learning to
love your children, no matter what.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.560
Whether they go to prison, or lock
themselves in a feckin' cupboard,

17:15.560 --> 17:18.480
or even if they're homosexual.
Am I right, Father?

17:18.480 --> 17:21.800
Well, er...homosexual is a bit...
LAUGHTER

17:21.800 --> 17:24.840
And if you get it right, and I
think these two have got it right...

17:24.840 --> 17:26.800
Oh, Maria,

17:26.800 --> 17:29.840
you can be happy. Happier
than you ever thought possible.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.400
There's your
pre-marriage chat, Maria...

17:33.400 --> 17:35.880
Do you have anything
to add to that, Father?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.720
No.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.720
Not a thing. Thank you, Father.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.880
Goodnight and God bless you.

17:48.360 --> 17:53.040
KNOCKING
Goodnight, Dermot. Father, you're
talking to the ironing board now.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.800
LAUGHTER

17:54.800 --> 17:57.400
KNOCKING
Goodnight, Dermot.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.440
Goodnight, Father.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.160
Rory...

18:08.160 --> 18:10.720
I want to talk to you...
about your illness.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.200
LAUGHTER

18:12.200 --> 18:15.080
Mammy, it's not an illness!
Well, it's not normal!

18:15.080 --> 18:16.560
Mammy!

18:17.760 --> 18:18.960
Fine.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.320
Rory...

18:20.320 --> 18:22.640
what I'm trying to say is...

18:22.640 --> 18:27.400
you are what you are. Whatever you
are, I will always be your mother.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.760
And I want you to know that it
doesn't matter how far we are apart,

18:30.760 --> 18:34.360
or long we are apart,
I will always be here waiting...

18:34.360 --> 18:35.680
with a loving heart.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.080
Awww! It's nice, isn't it? Yeah.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
I read it on a card!

18:39.760 --> 18:42.400
LAUGHTER

18:42.400 --> 18:44.040
May you rest in peace.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.880
LAUGHTER

18:46.880 --> 18:48.240
Mammy!

18:48.240 --> 18:49.840
Sorry.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.960
Rory,
what I am trying to say is...

18:53.960 --> 18:58.080
have you ever considered
that you might be...homosexual?

18:59.840 --> 19:03.520
Now, I know this comes
as a bit of a shock.

19:03.520 --> 19:08.720
And you probably want to think about
it, but here's a book. Here!

19:08.720 --> 19:10.480
That'll explain everything,

19:10.480 --> 19:14.280
except why Cathy hasn't got
a boyfriend even though
she's not lesbian or gay.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.160
Mammy!

19:16.160 --> 19:18.280
Sorry.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.280
Thanks, Mammy.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.560
Oh, you're hurting Mammy now!

19:29.760 --> 19:32.240
OK, erm...

19:32.240 --> 19:34.840
I'd better go and...read.
Do, love.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.120
Well, Mammy, I thought
you handled that very well.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.480
It wasn't easy, it was difficult.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.080
I hope Rory never has to have that
talk with any of his own children.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.760
LAUGHTER

19:53.520 --> 19:55.960
Dermot, love...

19:55.960 --> 19:58.800
your wedding suit is here.
I don't care!

20:01.560 --> 20:04.320
You should go up and have a bath
for the big day tomorrow.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.160
No. Go away.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.280
Cathy, what are we going to do?

20:11.280 --> 20:15.760
The wedding's tomorrow and we won't
all fit in that fuckin' cupboard!

20:17.520 --> 20:19.920
Mrs Brown,
I think I have it this time...

20:19.920 --> 20:23.720
Lovely. Leave it on the table,
Buster. I'll read it later.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.520
God, Buster, you look exhausted!

20:25.520 --> 20:28.120
I am, Cathy,
I haven't slept for two days.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.040
Well, you want to sleep tonight.
We need you fresh tomorrow!

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
Don't worry.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.120
Hold on, Buster. Yeah? Read this
to Mammy and see what she thinks.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.720
Leave it there. I'll read it later.
No, Mammy. Listen now. Sit down.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.880
Here, Buster...

20:41.880 --> 20:43.480
Read!

20:48.720 --> 20:49.800
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

20:49.800 --> 20:52.640
"Ladies and gentlemen
and the Reverend Father."

20:52.640 --> 20:54.840
Yeah, very well done, well done.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.880
"Can you believe that
Dermot Brown is married?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.480
"And to such a beautiful girl."

21:02.080 --> 21:03.640
From there.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.520
But you're skipping me joke about
the camel, the nun and the coconut!

21:08.520 --> 21:12.000
We'll live... read!

21:12.000 --> 21:14.880
Let's hope the camel does.

21:14.880 --> 21:19.800
"I don't know why Dermo picked me
to be his best friend...

21:19.800 --> 21:22.120
"but I'm really glad he did.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.000
"All I ever wanted to be
when I grew up was Dermot Brown.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.240
"He's the one who makes you laugh

21:32.240 --> 21:33.920
"even when you're in prison."

21:35.800 --> 21:37.480
I'll take that out.

21:40.760 --> 21:47.120
"I don't know why, but someone,
somewhere looked down on me
and thought...

21:47.120 --> 21:50.280
"'that eejit
needs a guardian angel'...

21:54.040 --> 21:56.800
"..and they sent Dermot Brown."

21:59.200 --> 22:01.080
I'm going up for me bath!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.760
So, what do you want changed?

22:08.280 --> 22:11.560
Nothing. I think it's
absolutely perfect, Buster.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.680
Oh, yes!

22:16.200 --> 22:20.280
HE SNORES

22:20.280 --> 22:22.560
LAUGHTER

22:26.720 --> 22:30.120
So, Winnie, Jacko's blind now, is he?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.720
It was his own fault, Agnes.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.920
He was dying for a cigarette as
soon as he got out of that hospital!

22:34.920 --> 22:37.400
If only he'd taken off
the oxygen mask!

22:38.680 --> 22:40.200
Yeah.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.040
LAUGHTER

22:43.040 --> 22:45.200
Whooooo! Wah-hey!

22:45.200 --> 22:48.600
God, I'd nearly go straight myself!

22:48.600 --> 22:51.480
Really?! No!

22:51.480 --> 22:54.200
Not even Father Quinn
will be safe today!

22:54.200 --> 22:55.240
Shag off!

22:59.160 --> 23:01.120
Well, well, Cathy.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.120
You look different!

23:03.120 --> 23:07.760
So what do you think, Mammy? I think
you've never looked more beautiful.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.000
Mammy, that's the suit
from Marcelle's window.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.440
Isn't it beautiful? You couldn't
afford that. Where did you get it?

23:15.440 --> 23:19.400
It was a surprise, I came out
of the shower and someone left it
on the bed for me!

23:22.360 --> 23:24.480
LAUGHTER

23:26.080 --> 23:28.440
LAUGHTER

23:29.600 --> 23:31.480
Grandad, you can't go like that!

23:31.480 --> 23:33.920
Ma, Grandad's stripped again!

23:33.920 --> 23:37.800
Oh, for God's sake, Cathy.
I thought I told you to dress him!

23:37.800 --> 23:40.560
Yeah, Mammy, twice already.
He keeps taking off the suit!

23:40.560 --> 23:42.600
Well, go back up and put it on him.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.520
And staple the feckin' thing
to him if you have to!

23:47.600 --> 23:50.480
Well, at least he's wearing
more than Cathy!

23:50.480 --> 23:54.040
Careful, Winnie, you'll end up having
a meal through a tube beside Jacko.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.520
"Ladies and gentlemen
and the Reverend Father..."

23:59.520 --> 24:01.480
Yeah! We've heard it before. Get out!

24:03.000 --> 24:04.280
Here, Agnes...

24:04.280 --> 24:06.760
remember the excitement
the morning of my wedding?

24:06.760 --> 24:09.000
I do. Sure, mine was the same!

24:09.000 --> 24:12.920
I remember standing on the altar and
the priest looked at me and he said,

24:12.920 --> 24:14.680
"Agnes, do you take...

24:14.680 --> 24:18.960
"this...to be
your lawfully wedded husband?"

24:18.960 --> 24:24.720
And I remember, I looked
into Jacko's eyes and I whispered,
"I do".

24:24.720 --> 24:28.680
I remember, I looked into
Redser's eyes and I said,

24:28.680 --> 24:30.040
"I'll see."

24:32.320 --> 24:34.720
Here, you had that Father...

24:34.720 --> 24:36.640
Oh, what was his name? Oh, erm...

24:36.640 --> 24:39.600
Father McCrum!
Right, Agnes, McCrum.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.680
And in his deep voice, he said,

24:41.680 --> 24:44.960
"I now pronounce you man and wife!"
Yes...

24:44.960 --> 24:46.680
and then me waters broke! Yeah!

24:46.680 --> 24:49.560
LAUGHTER

24:49.560 --> 24:52.000
Well, someone's having a good time!

24:52.000 --> 24:54.920
Hello! Hiya!
We were just over at Maria's...

24:54.920 --> 24:58.760
She looks stunning! Does she?
And her hair's only fabulous!

24:58.760 --> 24:59.960
Of course!

24:59.960 --> 25:02.160
OK, everybody.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.040
It's the big moment.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.440
Ladies and gentlemen...
Dermot Brown!

25:07.440 --> 25:10.720
THEY CHEER

25:13.280 --> 25:15.120
Oh, my God, Dermot...

25:15.120 --> 25:17.920
you look amazing! Thanks, Mammy!

25:17.920 --> 25:20.880
It only feels like yesterday
I was bathing you...

25:20.880 --> 25:22.320
It was yesterday!

25:22.320 --> 25:25.000
LAUGHTER

25:25.000 --> 25:26.480
Dermot, son...

25:26.480 --> 25:29.600
I've never told you
that I'm proud of you.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.320
Right.
LAUGHTER

25:34.320 --> 25:38.640
Let's get down to the church
and get this thing feckin' started!

25:38.640 --> 25:41.840
Get the flowers! Get the flowers!

25:41.840 --> 25:43.520
I'll get the feckin' flowers!

25:48.440 --> 25:50.760
Well, that's that then...

25:50.760 --> 25:53.080
Another one gone. Huh!

25:55.680 --> 25:59.560
It's always difficult for a mother
when another one leaves the nest.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.320
But that's our job, you know,

26:01.320 --> 26:05.200
to get them ready to go out into
the mad, mad world on their own.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.240
It'll be strange to look
into Dermot's bedroom
and just see an empty bed...

26:12.240 --> 26:15.240
and a stack of dirty magazines!
LAUGHTER

26:15.240 --> 26:16.840
Mammy! Dermot?

26:16.840 --> 26:20.440
Is there any chance Maria and me
can stay here for a while,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.160
just until we get
a place of our own?

26:22.160 --> 26:26.400
Of course. You and Maria can stay
here for as long as you like.
As long as you feckin' like!

26:26.400 --> 26:30.200
Thanks, Ma.
That's a load off me mind.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.720
It's a load off my mind!

26:31.720 --> 26:34.040
DOOR SHUTS

26:35.440 --> 26:37.480
Will I ever get feckin' rid of them?

26:38.880 --> 26:40.200
I'll see you, goodbye!

26:41.840 --> 26:43.040
APPLAUSE

26:43.040 --> 26:44.320
# Say hello

26:44.320 --> 26:48.960
# To the queen of Dublin Town

26:48.960 --> 26:50.640

27:32.040 --> 27:34.800
# She's Mrs Brown Agnes

27:34.800 --> 27:37.920
# That's Mrs Brown Agnes

27:37.920 --> 27:40.600
# That's Mrs Brown Agnes... #
