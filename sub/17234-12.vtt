Well, I really do look
forward to seeing you tonight.

08:34.857 --> 08:35.995
I've missed you, Rayna.

08:35.996 --> 08:37.111
I missed you, too.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.172
Ohh. Thank you.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.952
[Chuckles]

08:44.953 --> 08:46.946
I was trying to make you
some breakfast in bed here.

08:47.716 --> 08:49.374
I have to be at the office
in 20 minutes, though.

08:50.395 --> 08:51.550
You got in at 3:00 A.M.

08:51.551 --> 08:52.890
What the hell kind of case is this?

08:52.891 --> 08:53.780
- [Sighs] A big one.
- Oh.

08:54.487 --> 08:56.188
And because of client confidentiality,

08:56.189 --> 08:57.806
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

08:57.807 --> 09:00.763
<i>But... I can talk about this.</i>

09:01.459 --> 09:03.067
Congratulations!

09:03.068 --> 09:05.047
Yeah, well, don't make a big deal of it.

09:05.048 --> 09:06.567
That is a crap contract,

09:06.568 --> 09:08.828
which is, apparently, standard these days.

09:08.829 --> 09:10.691
You can't get a better
one with another label?

09:10.692 --> 09:12.264
<i>Yeah, well, in order to get a good deal,</i>

09:12.265 --> 09:13.648
<i>you got to be a big deal.</i>

09:14.183 --> 09:16.342
Or, you know, bring some
kind of heat to the table.

09:16.343 --> 09:18.792
<i>Well, I don't know. I think
you bring a lot of heat.</i>

09:18.793 --> 09:20.240
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

09:20.596 --> 09:21.771
[Both laugh]

09:21.772 --> 09:23.718
You know, in that department,
something that might help

09:23.719 --> 09:25.882
is that Rayna just asked me
if I wanted to write with her.

09:27.946 --> 09:28.989
Okay.

09:30.542 --> 09:33.076
So, how does this help you
pursue your solo career?

09:33.077 --> 09:34.340
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.755
You just started writing...
Finally... on your own

09:36.756 --> 09:38.688
and you seem to be feeling
pretty good about that.

09:38.689 --> 09:39.601
Well, yeah, I mean,

09:39.602 --> 09:41.467
but she's got a number-one
single out there.

09:41.468 --> 09:42.824
She's about to release a new album.

09:42.825 --> 09:44.411
If we get this on it and it's a big hit,

09:44.412 --> 09:46.813
that... brings something to the table.

09:46.814 --> 09:49.425
All right. Sounds like somebody's
already made up his mind.

09:53.362 --> 09:54.798
No point in heading to West Virginia.

09:54.799 --> 09:56.292
Those venues are canceling, too.

09:56.933 --> 09:59.400
So are the Raleigh and
the Charleston dates. God.

09:59.401 --> 10:01.003
These people signed contracts.

10:01.605 --> 10:03.187
And they're prepared to
take the financial hit

10:03.188 --> 10:05.010
rather than risk association with you.

10:05.011 --> 10:07.088
Oh, thank you for sugar-coatin' that one.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.114
Look, I didn't... Look,
what I mean to say...

10:09.115 --> 10:10.587
Is that there's nothing we can do.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.405
What I want to hear is "yes, there is."

10:13.406 --> 10:15.358
I've got the lawyers looking
into the insurance claims

10:15.359 --> 10:16.611
and the legal action.

10:16.612 --> 10:17.964
Edgehill's sending out Will and Layla

10:17.965 --> 10:19.947
to do some promo stuff to
try and staunch the bleeding.

10:19.948 --> 10:22.704
The only thing you can do
right now is to go home.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.471
Okay, so, after this radio thing,

10:28.472 --> 10:29.586
we have one more
meet-and-greet.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.969
- Then we go home?
- Yeah.

10:30.970 --> 10:32.684
It's about a three-hour
drive from here to Nashville,

10:32.685 --> 10:33.896
which should get us there just in time

10:33.897 --> 10:35.160
for the "Ball and Chain" number-one party.

10:35.161 --> 10:36.395
Oh, no, no, no. I can't go to a party.

10:36.396 --> 10:37.558
I-I'm so tired, I feel sick.

10:37.559 --> 10:39.205
<i>I-I don't want to go to that party.</i>

10:39.206 --> 10:40.692
Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel sick,

10:40.693 --> 10:41.829
but we... This is really important.

10:41.830 --> 10:42.816
- 17 seconds, guys.
- Oh, hey.

10:42.817 --> 10:43.688
It's a pleasure to have you with us.

10:43.689 --> 10:44.558
- Thank you.
- Come on in.

10:44.559 --> 10:45.708
Hey, thanks. Nice to be here.

10:46.175 --> 10:49.398
Listen, Scarlett, you're on Rayna's
label, you're on Luke's tour.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.126
This is a party for the writer
of their number-one song,

10:51.127 --> 10:52.018
so you have to go.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.748
All right, guys. Three, two...

10:53.749 --> 10:55.253
And we're back with Scarlett o'Connor...

10:55.254 --> 10:56.750
Just signed with Highway 65 Records

10:56.751 --> 10:58.872
<i>by none other than the Rayna Jaymes.</i>

10:59.186 --> 11:00.795
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.

11:00.796 --> 11:01.783
Hello, Knoxville!

11:01.784 --> 11:02.618
No, it's...

11:02.619 --> 11:04.041
No, it's Chattanooga. I'm so sorry.

11:04.042 --> 11:05.757
I haven't slept in about six days.

11:06.344 --> 11:08.901
That's cool, man, letting the verse
breathe like that a little bit.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.915
Yeah. I was thinking maybe we could...

11:10.916 --> 11:12.261
Maybe we could cut it down a little bit,

11:12.262 --> 11:13.596
maybe lose the last two bars.

11:13.597 --> 11:14.908
Let's try it. Why not?

11:14.909 --> 11:16.524
All right. [Cellphone chirps]

11:16.525 --> 11:18.336
I'm sorry. [Chuckles] I'll shut this off.

11:18.337 --> 11:19.524
You got somewhere you need to be?

11:19.525 --> 11:20.624
Uh...

11:20.625 --> 11:22.568
Yeah, no. It's just this
thing with my girlfriend.

11:22.569 --> 11:24.078
I can... I can get out of it.

11:24.079 --> 11:26.003
We can pick this up later.
It's cool... honestly.

11:26.004 --> 11:28.428
She's fine. She knows music's a priority.

11:28.429 --> 11:29.491
Give me a second.

11:31.822 --> 11:33.252
[Ringing] [Clears throat]

11:33.253 --> 11:34.394
[Cellphone beeps] Hey, you.

11:34.395 --> 11:35.341
Hey.

11:35.342 --> 11:38.700
I'm gonna have to reschedule
meeting with your friends today.

11:38.701 --> 11:40.854
Me and Jay are kind of
caught up in it right now.

11:41.175 --> 11:42.138
Is that all right?

11:42.139 --> 11:44.047
Yeah. Sure. We'll just... reschedule.

11:44.695 --> 11:45.438
You all right?

11:45.783 --> 11:47.025
I'm fine.

11:47.026 --> 11:48.889
Okay. Well, um, I'll see you later, then.

11:49.478 --> 11:50.324
Bye.

11:50.648 --> 11:51.608
[Cellphone beeps]

11:52.275 --> 11:54.166
That is the third time he's canceled on me.

11:55.164 --> 11:57.138
Is this your, uh, church-friends thing?

11:57.478 --> 11:58.506
Yeah.

11:58.507 --> 11:59.509
And you're annoyed?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.321
Even though you just said you were fine?

12:01.739 --> 12:02.939
He knows I'm not.

12:03.659 --> 12:04.941
<i>He should know I'm not.</i>

12:04.942 --> 12:07.452
See, that's... that's what
confuses me about women.

12:07.453 --> 12:09.119
You say one thing and mean another.

12:09.446 --> 12:10.337
If you want him to go,

12:10.338 --> 12:11.891
you should just say so straight out.

12:11.892 --> 12:14.122
Yeah, but, see, I don't
want to not be supportive.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.956
You know, everything
that's going on right now

12:15.957 --> 12:17.666
is really huge for him.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.648
<i>Last thing he needs is that girlfriend,</i>

12:19.649 --> 12:22.597
the kind that's needy and
all up in his business.

12:22.598 --> 12:25.149
As opposed to the kind that
eventually explodes on him?

12:25.890 --> 12:27.742
Just tell Gunnar what you're thinkin'.

12:27.743 --> 12:29.051
Tell him what's going on for you.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.481
Otherwise, how's he supposed to know?

12:32.026 --> 12:34.822
<i>Well, the controversy
surrounding Juliette Barnes</i>

12:34.823 --> 12:36.138
<i>continues to plague</i>

12:36.139 --> 12:38.146
<i>the embattled singer's national tour.</i>

12:38.147 --> 12:40.027
<i>Yeah, half a dozen venues in two states</i>

12:40.028 --> 12:41.727
<i>have canceled concert dates...</i>

12:41.728 --> 12:43.245
<i>Some in a show of protest,</i>

12:43.246 --> 12:46.045
<i>others out of concern for public safety...</i>

12:46.046 --> 12:49.001
<i>All the result of her
comments on the subject of God.</i>

12:49.002 --> 12:50.114
[TV shuts off]

12:50.115 --> 12:51.289
You don't need to be watching that.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.938
Any news on the east coast dates?

12:55.477 --> 12:56.722
Jeff: Maybe you'll get lucky...

12:57.144 --> 12:59.517
And another disaster
will hit the front page.

12:59.518 --> 13:00.603
What are you doing here?

13:00.604 --> 13:01.681
Came to speak with my artist.

13:02.942 --> 13:04.017
Alone.

13:07.297 --> 13:09.193
You got somethin' to say, say it.

13:09.603 --> 13:10.829
You know what you've done?

13:10.830 --> 13:11.914
Nothing wrong.

13:12.430 --> 13:13.893
You've done more damage to Edgehill Records

13:13.894 --> 13:16.067
than if you would have
burned the building down

13:16.068 --> 13:16.983
with everyone in it.

13:16.984 --> 13:18.703
I was taken out of context.

13:18.704 --> 13:20.745
Yeah, and I have been
taken to task by a CFO

13:21.153 --> 13:21.980
who has been telling me

13:21.981 --> 13:23.788
that our stocks have taken a huge hit.

13:23.789 --> 13:27.369
And worse than that, I've had
10 influential radio programmers

13:27.370 --> 13:30.639
call me personally to say that
they will not play you anymore.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.525
It's gonna blow over. It has to.

13:33.526 --> 13:34.476
No.

13:34.477 --> 13:35.979
No, Juliette, it doesn't.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.102
Get out of my house.

13:37.869 --> 13:39.329
Do you think you're talented?

13:40.434 --> 13:41.280
Hmm?

13:42.140 --> 13:44.557
Do you think you deserve this house?

13:46.214 --> 13:48.003
'Cause I think you're just visiting...

13:48.982 --> 13:52.334
That you're trailer trash
hiding under a pile of sequins.

13:52.844 --> 13:56.423
You should thank God for your good fortune,

13:56.882 --> 13:58.437
not deny he exists.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.343
I never said that.

13:59.344 --> 14:01.595
And that's exactly what
you're gonna do... beg.

14:02.984 --> 14:04.883
You're gonna beg, publicly
beg this country...

14:04.884 --> 14:06.334
And him... for forgiveness.

14:06.335 --> 14:07.298
I'm not gonna lie.

14:08.505 --> 14:10.002
<i>You are a lie.</i>

14:11.378 --> 14:15.368
An uneducated, mildly talented lie.

14:15.369 --> 14:16.561
And you know it.

14:16.562 --> 14:19.795
And you will own this sin,
whether it's true or not.

14:19.796 --> 14:21.132
Am I making myself clear?

14:23.208 --> 14:25.661
Am I making myself clear?!

14:26.854 --> 14:28.082
Yes.

14:29.025 --> 14:29.944
Yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:47.273 --> 14:48.891
Mm! [Laughs]

14:48.892 --> 14:50.026
This is more like it.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.104
I don't know how you think
you're gonna play guitar

14:53.105 --> 14:54.433
with those greasy fingers.

14:54.847 --> 14:56.709
Look, if I can play a guitar solo

14:56.710 --> 14:58.689
while I eat a triple-Decker
cheeseburger...

14:58.690 --> 15:02.071
Oh, the famous
tripe-Decker cheeseburger...

15:02.072 --> 15:03.936
- You're damn right.
- That inspired "Here I Go Again."

15:03.937 --> 15:05.038
Mm-hmm.

15:05.039 --> 15:08.107
Which, by the way, we wrote
right here on this floor.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.506
- Yes, we did.
- Like so many others.

15:09.507 --> 15:10.437
Mm-hmm.

15:10.791 --> 15:13.836
"Baby, I Don't Mind,"
"I Shouldn't Love You,"

15:14.296 --> 15:15.205
"Take a Walk."

15:15.206 --> 15:17.222
We didn't write "I shouldn't
love you" on this floor.

15:17.223 --> 15:18.623
Yeah, we did.

15:18.624 --> 15:19.615
No, we didn't.

15:20.075 --> 15:21.364
[Chuckling] Rayna, we did.

15:22.034 --> 15:23.015
No, we didn't.

15:23.016 --> 15:24.227
Okay, fine. Where'd we write it?

15:26.976 --> 15:28.328
Oh.

15:31.209 --> 15:32.393
You know that riff you
were playing earlier?

15:32.394 --> 15:33.773
Try that lyric to it.

15:34.446 --> 15:35.399
Okay.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.268
Aide: I'm reluctant to bring this up,

15:39.269 --> 15:40.893
but I thought you might want to know.

15:40.894 --> 15:43.003
Seems Stoffel's family's
claiming he's innocent and...

15:43.004 --> 15:43.965
Innocent?

15:45.368 --> 15:47.217
That man shot my wife.

15:47.218 --> 15:48.807
I saw it with my own two eyes.

15:48.808 --> 15:49.875
Obviously, they're in denial.

15:50.190 --> 15:52.310
M-most families are when
it comes to stuff like this.

15:52.311 --> 15:54.325
But they went and hired a lawyer.

15:54.326 --> 15:55.683
Hired a lawyer? To do what?

15:56.087 --> 15:58.537
Pressure the police into
investigating his death, I guess.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.198
His family doesn't believe
he committed suicide.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.980
Wait. Who the hell did they hire?

16:05.385 --> 16:06.637
Lot of security out there.

16:07.316 --> 16:09.018
Not much choice. She expecting you?

16:09.019 --> 16:11.554
Probably not, but hopefully,
she won't mind me coming by.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.985
Hold on just a second.
She's in her bedroom.

16:13.690 --> 16:14.687
Juliette?

16:16.103 --> 16:17.987
Juliette? Someone's here for you.

16:17.988 --> 16:19.440
[Knock on door]

16:19.441 --> 16:20.620
You okay in there?

16:22.033 --> 16:24.474
Juliette?! [Doorknob rattles]

16:24.475 --> 16:25.786
[Door bursts open]

16:25.787 --> 16:27.018
- Juliette?
- Oh, God.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.043
Is she breathing?

16:28.044 --> 16:29.941
Hey! Wake up! Juliette! Wake up!

16:29.942 --> 16:31.517
[Slurred] Stop!

16:33.769 --> 16:35.127
Avery?

16:35.618 --> 16:37.088
What are you doing here?

16:37.429 --> 16:39.003
Don't you have a girlfriend?

16:39.004 --> 16:40.547
What? No, not anymore.

16:40.548 --> 16:41.587
Listen, are you okay?

16:42.062 --> 16:43.172

25:59.436 --> 26:01.674

I borrow you for a second?

Where are we going?

26:05.824 --> 26:06.860

26:06.861 --> 26:08.641
<i>and pretending we're just duet partners</i>

26:08.642 --> 26:10.901

It is.

26:12.951 --> 26:14.674
Look, I need to make something clear.

I know I didn't support you
buying yourself out of Edgehill,

but it wasn't my place to say so.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.412

I'm trying to apologize here.

You don't have to apologize to me.

26:29.325 --> 26:31.368
<i>And that's one of the
things I like about you.</i>

26:31.369 --> 26:32.389
You just said the opposite

26:32.390 --> 26:33.456
of what I thought you were gonna say.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.361
Um, you surprise me.

26:35.677 --> 26:39.906

of all these people, that's it.

We're done. We are a celebrity couple.

shopping or on vacation...

pictures and swarming us.

- You are?

26:56.856 --> 26:57.872
Yeah, I am.

26:57.873 --> 26:59.957
It's just... yeah, I just
think the situation is...

26:59.958 --> 27:00.974
- What, complicated?
- Yes.

for us to just go back to being
friends again after what happened?

30:00.427 --> 30:02.741

mistakes were made and...

singing with Kelly Clarkson.

35:34.276 --> 35:35.310
Hey.

35:35.311 --> 35:36.311
Did you have fun?

35:36.312 --> 35:37.271
Yeah. [Chuckles]

35:38.057 --> 35:39.400
Yeah, it was a great party.

35:39.401 --> 35:40.424
It's a great song.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.900
Not as good as ours, but...

35:42.901 --> 35:43.745
No.

35:44.287 --> 35:45.264
[Both chuckle]

35:46.123 --> 35:47.752
It was real nice working with you again.

35:47.753 --> 35:48.795
Yeah.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.842
It was really fun.

35:51.906 --> 35:54.667
Probably not something we
should do again anytime soon.

35:55.826 --> 35:57.105
I don't think we should.

35:58.638 --> 36:00.203
You got your label takin' off,

36:00.204 --> 36:02.641
I got this shot at a solo career.

36:03.471 --> 36:04.543
Yeah.

36:04.544 --> 36:07.051
Feels like both our lives
are really moving forward.

36:09.105 --> 36:10.135
Might be a little too easy

36:10.136 --> 36:12.085
to fall back into those old patterns.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.129
Yeah.

36:15.637 --> 36:16.710
All right, well...

36:17.097 --> 36:18.596
I'll... I'll see you.

36:18.597 --> 36:19.888
All right.

36:41.577 --> 36:42.594
Albert.

36:44.092 --> 36:45.418
You must miss Lamar.

36:45.875 --> 36:46.966
[Sighs]

36:46.967 --> 36:48.720
I apologize for not
making more of an effort

36:48.721 --> 36:51.020
to come by and offer my condolences.

36:51.331 --> 36:52.280
That's not why I'm here.

36:52.986 --> 36:54.444
Did you know Donald Stoffel?

36:55.892 --> 36:57.584
The man who shot my wife?

36:57.585 --> 36:58.956
Only from the papers.

36:58.957 --> 36:59.941
You sure about that?

36:59.942 --> 37:02.329
Because, see, I found out
something very odd today.

37:03.025 --> 37:05.364
A few years ago, he worked
at Hollander Enterprises.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.805
Good for him.

37:07.114 --> 37:09.969
Yeah, I was... I was wondering
how you were gonna play this.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.362
Seems you've gone with "dumb."

37:11.363 --> 37:12.317
Mr. Mayor...

37:12.318 --> 37:14.979
Hollander Enterprises was
an off-the-books subsidiary

37:14.980 --> 37:16.009
of Wyatt Industries.

37:16.559 --> 37:18.579
And Lamar's name may
not be on the paperwork,

37:18.580 --> 37:20.952
but he did talk business
from time to time at dinner,

37:20.953 --> 37:22.777
even while claiming it was bad manners.

37:23.081 --> 37:25.150
I have no idea what you're suggesting.

37:25.151 --> 37:26.628
I'm suggesting that your boss

37:27.000 --> 37:28.507
has a connection to Donald Stoffel.

37:30.085 --> 37:32.190
It's my understanding that paranoia

37:33.013 --> 37:35.390
is a component of post-traumatic stress.

37:36.133 --> 37:37.101
Terrible thing.

37:38.450 --> 37:39.547
Why?

37:40.442 --> 37:42.741
Because I didn't give him
his city contracts back?

37:42.742 --> 37:44.434
Because he thought I was a
witness for the grand jury?

37:44.435 --> 37:45.837
As ordinary citizens,

37:45.838 --> 37:48.562
neither I nor your
former father-in-law

37:48.563 --> 37:51.040
had access to any sort of witness list.

37:51.041 --> 37:52.375
After all, what kind of information

37:52.376 --> 37:54.052
could you offer the prosecution?

37:54.821 --> 37:59.189
Rayna's crash, Lamar's
arrest, Peggy's death...

37:59.831 --> 38:02.614
You seem to attract all sorts of bad luck.

38:52.794 --> 38:55.671
I am so sorry I couldn't
make the party last night.

38:55.672 --> 38:56.742
Yeah.

38:56.743 --> 38:59.285
Well, better be one hell of a case.

39:00.081 --> 39:02.447
<i>'Cause you're missing out on
all my big career decisions.</i>

39:02.448 --> 39:03.525
Oh, I am?

39:03.526 --> 39:04.458
[Chuckling] Yeah.

39:05.330 --> 39:06.668
I decided to sign with Belcourt.

39:06.983 --> 39:08.188
[Gasps]

39:08.189 --> 39:09.491
Gonna focus on my music.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.433
Wait. And not write with Rayna?

39:12.434 --> 39:13.808
<i>I hope this isn't on my account.</i>

39:13.809 --> 39:15.431
No, no, no. All me.

39:16.611 --> 39:17.751
Yay.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.485
[Both chuckle]

39:25.641 --> 39:26.717
Hey.

39:26.718 --> 39:28.902
Rayna, I... I'm so sorry.

39:29.813 --> 39:31.247
I just slept 12 hours straight,

39:31.248 --> 39:33.240
and I-I was exhausted yesterday.

39:33.241 --> 39:35.658
I-I have no right to comment
on your personal life...

39:36.233 --> 39:37.528
Not ever.

39:37.529 --> 39:38.739
It's okay.

39:38.740 --> 39:39.824
Come on in.

39:39.825 --> 39:41.064
[Sighs]

39:42.144 --> 39:43.189
Listen.

39:44.324 --> 39:46.140
You don't have to apologize to me.

39:46.855 --> 39:48.376
That's not why I called you over here.

39:48.377 --> 39:49.508
Let's have a seat.

39:50.039 --> 39:51.478
I do want to talk to you, though.

39:56.053 --> 39:57.774
You got so much talent, girl.

39:57.775 --> 39:59.156
But it takes more than that.

40:00.444 --> 40:01.877
You got to want it so bad

40:01.878 --> 40:04.349
that you're willing to be exhausted,

40:04.785 --> 40:07.819
that you're willing to be
on a bus night after night,

40:08.494 --> 40:10.813
that you're willing to show
up at your ex-boyfriend's party

40:10.814 --> 40:12.537
and pretend you're having a good time...

40:12.538 --> 40:14.070
'Cause you want this

40:14.071 --> 40:15.918
more than you hate all those other things.

40:17.097 --> 40:18.486
<i>I do want it.</i>

40:19.057 --> 40:21.313
I'm not gonna apologize
for asking a lot from you,

40:21.314 --> 40:22.957
'cause that goes with the territory.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.637
But if you want to get
out of this right now,

40:24.638 --> 40:26.185
there is no shame in that.

40:26.578 --> 40:27.769
[Inhales deeply]

40:28.235 --> 40:31.013
I never wanted to be a singer.

40:33.301 --> 40:35.754
Wasn't any plan I had.
It just happened to me.

40:35.755 --> 40:37.946
And I didn't know how hard it was gonna be.

40:38.392 --> 40:39.379
[Sniffles]

40:39.380 --> 40:40.469
But I also didn't know

40:40.828 --> 40:42.454
what it would feel like out there...

40:44.067 --> 40:45.312
On that stage.

40:46.358 --> 40:48.034
All those people, all those faces,

40:49.409 --> 40:51.200
the energy that comes off of them,

40:51.201 --> 40:54.358
the way... They react to my music is...

40:56.043 --> 40:57.410
Is magic.

40:58.683 --> 40:59.939
<i>I do want it.</i>

41:00.800 --> 41:05.325
I love it more than I
hate all those things.

41:05.743 --> 41:07.545
Then you got to let that drive you.

41:16.652 --> 41:17.816
Mr. Mayor?

41:17.817 --> 41:20.331
I know who's behind
this... Who ordered the hit.

41:21.371 --> 41:22.944
It was Lamar Wyatt.

41:27.509 --> 41:28.817
Hey.

41:28.818 --> 41:30.007
What are you doing here?

41:30.008 --> 41:31.255
I made my decision.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.670
I'm gonna need you to write a song with me.

41:36.370 --> 41:37.639
Where's your guitar?

41:40.941 --> 41:43.368
Thank you for these beautiful flowers.

41:43.369 --> 41:46.520
Well, I figured I'd be
getting a yes or a no today.

41:46.521 --> 41:47.705
Oh, you did, did you?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.348
Yeah. Regardless, you deserve some flowers.

41:49.349 --> 41:50.365
[Gasps]

41:50.366 --> 41:51.562
Well, that's very sweet.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.358
<i>I have been thinking about you a lot.</i>

41:54.359 --> 41:55.247
Yeah?

41:55.248 --> 41:56.443
I don't know... What would happen

41:56.444 --> 41:58.263
if we were to make it official?

41:58.264 --> 42:01.251
"Ruke"? Or "Layna" or
whatever. [Luke laughs]

42:01.600 --> 42:04.219
I have never understood
that name-combining thing.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.226
I haven't, either.

42:06.086 --> 42:08.576
Then again, I guess I've never
been in this situation before.

42:08.577 --> 42:10.054
What situation is that?

42:10.376 --> 42:12.041
What... We're both huge stars?

42:12.042 --> 42:14.164
Feels like something worth investing in.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.548
I'd love that.

42:16.437 --> 42:19.751
And, hey, you know I am never
gonna be "Mr. Rayna Jaymes,"

42:19.752 --> 42:21.735
just like you're never
gonna be "Mrs. Luke Wheeler."

42:21.736 --> 42:22.571
No.

42:22.572 --> 42:24.647
We'll still be our own people.

42:24.648 --> 42:26.021
"Layna" aside.

42:26.022 --> 42:26.899
You mean "Ruke."

42:26.900 --> 42:27.940
Yeah.

42:28.984 --> 42:31.321
Well, my girls are gonna
be coming home soon.

42:32.304 --> 42:33.741
Might be nice for you to meet them.
