00:01.697 --> 00:03.133
<i>Previously on</i> East New York... I can't believe you're back.

00:03.133 --> 00:04.221
Today at the dispensary,

00:04.221 --> 00:05.266
<i>I went out to the car.</i>

00:05.266 --> 00:06.658
<i>I stayed out there hoping</i>

00:06.658 --> 00:07.529
that if anybody had
to get shot inside,

00:07.529 --> 00:08.965
it wouldn't be me.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.662
There's an Antoine Jordan
who has a podcast.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.709
I take you seriously
as a journalist, Mr. Jordan.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.059
This is Don Jankowicz, Union
Trustee from Brooklyn North.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.887
She's really going
after this kid,

00:17.887 --> 00:19.889
Gabe Finley, like she's
got it in for him.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.848
I am officially announcing
my run for mayor.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.025
If I get elected,
I want you for PC.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.028
Allison Cha is a very
important addition to our team,

00:28.028 --> 00:31.466
knows when to cut and run,
knows when to come out swinging.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.729
Well, you told me what
it was like doing your job,

00:33.729 --> 00:34.947
and it made it...

00:34.947 --> 00:37.080
a little easier
for me doing mine.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.343
I'm glad I could be of service.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.093
Um, I got to go.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.761
Just...
Just let me...

01:05.761 --> 01:07.502
Let me drive... Andre.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.069
Let me drive.
<i>You want to drive? Let's go.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:10.331
No...
Babe?

01:10.331 --> 01:11.854
No, I don't want to. <i>[gunfire]</i>

01:11.854 --> 01:13.769
No. No! No!
Andre!

01:13.769 --> 01:15.597
Hey. Hey.
Huh?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.425
Hey, it's okay.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.253
It's me. You okay?

01:20.558 --> 01:21.777
What...?

01:21.777 --> 01:24.519
You were just screaming
in your sleep.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.520
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.652
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.306
What were you
dreaming about?

01:30.655 --> 01:32.004
I don't remember.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.658
- Was it about the shooting?
- No.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.835
Andre?

01:36.835 --> 01:39.229
Andre.

Good morning.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.473
My name is Regina Haywood,

02:05.473 --> 02:08.432
I'm the commanding officer
of the 7-4 precinct.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.565
There's been
an overall lack

02:10.565 --> 02:14.569
of communication between
the NYPD and the community.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.918
And I'm here

02:15.918 --> 02:18.660
today to address that,
in my precinct.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.488
Thank you for doing this.
I'm here along with

02:20.488 --> 02:22.577
some other mothers.
Hi, good morning.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.708
Thank you.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.101
And we would like
for our children

02:25.101 --> 02:28.452
to feel safe walking
to and from school.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.716
You have an absolute right
to expect that they would.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.849
There are things we're doing

02:33.849 --> 02:35.198
to make that a reality.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.331
We've increased
the number of patrol cars.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.550
Cars don't do us any good
if they're

02:39.550 --> 02:41.204
ten blocks away.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.945
But we're also putting
more cops on foot posts.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.686
All due respect,

02:44.686 --> 02:46.078
seeing five officers

02:46.078 --> 02:47.167
reading their phones
on a street corner...

02:47.167 --> 02:49.734
don't make us feel safer.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.520
We can significantly increase
our coverage of the area

02:52.520 --> 02:55.697
by having cops assigned
to solo foot posts.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.700
You mean cops walking
a beat by themselves?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.615
That's exactly what
I mean, yes, ma'am.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.621
<i>You're saying all the right
things, Inspector.</i>

03:06.621 --> 03:09.928
I'm not asking to be judged
by what I say, Mr. Jordan.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.582
You don't have to
worry about that.

03:11.582 --> 03:15.195
The people around here
want to see results.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.374
You think maybe you could've
run that by me beforehand?

03:20.374 --> 03:21.853
I apologize, I--

03:21.853 --> 03:24.595
You got to know you can't
institute a change like that

03:24.595 --> 03:26.771
without the approval
of the Chief of Patrol.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.383
Probably the PC, as well.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.733
Well, I think that we've come up
with a viable workaround,

03:31.733 --> 03:33.256
regarding that. Huh.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.910
We're going to institute
a Twelve-By-Twenty-Hundred Tour

03:34.910 --> 03:36.912
and deem it a special operation.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.088
What do you think the reaction
of the union is gonna be?

03:39.088 --> 03:40.916
- Not good.
- They're gonna go nuts.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.222
They're gonna say

03:42.222 --> 03:43.266
you're putting cops'
lives at risk.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.398
That's part of the job.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.878
They'll work
adjoining foot posts,

03:46.878 --> 03:49.316
they have radios and guns.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.100
They are trained.
And they'll be monitored

03:51.100 --> 03:52.580
by their sergeants.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.757
What they won't be doing
is watching videos on TikTok.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.541
Uh-huh.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.021
I wasn't sure...

03:59.021 --> 04:01.066
what the rest of my day
was gonna be like--I know

04:01.066 --> 04:02.764
I should've talked
to you about this first

04:02.764 --> 04:04.069
But now I know:

04:04.069 --> 04:05.723
I'm gonna spend it
answering for you.

04:05.723 --> 04:06.898
You do agree that
it's worthwhile

04:06.898 --> 04:08.509
to at least
give it a try?

04:08.509 --> 04:11.163
Yes, I do.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.645
Good.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.214
Good. At least we've
got him on principle.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.486
Everybody stay behind the tape
please, for your own good.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.619
All right? Stay back.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.664
It's for your own safety.
Thank you.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.104
What's it look like?

04:39.104 --> 04:40.671
The fire's under control,

04:40.671 --> 04:43.631
there's no casualties
that we know of, so far.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.372
Fire Marshall?

04:45.372 --> 04:48.810
Deputy Inspector
Haywood of the 7-4.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.028
Fire Marshall Greenville.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.508
We do a building search yet?

04:51.508 --> 04:52.770
Not yet, Deputy Inspector,

04:52.770 --> 04:53.902
because we just
got the fire out.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.643
Any ideas as to cause?

04:55.643 --> 04:56.992
Probably electrical.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.820
With all the chemicals
used in these hair salons,

04:58.820 --> 05:00.909
all it takes is a spark.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.519
Marshall.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.312
They found a body.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.488
The ME's office will
take care of notification

05:14.488 --> 05:15.445
of the next of kin,

05:15.445 --> 05:17.360
once we figure out
who they are.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.667
My guess is they're right there.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.538
Hmm?

05:34.986 --> 05:36.727
<i>She wants solo foot posts?</i>

05:36.727 --> 05:39.382
Got a lot of support at the
community meeting this morning.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.253
And the first time there's
a police-involved shooting?

05:41.253 --> 05:43.168
- That support disappears.
- I know.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.040
The same ones who say that
they want a cop on every corner,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.171
they're the ones
that are gonna be

05:46.171 --> 05:47.869
calling you
an occupying army.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.393
- You watch.
- Most people
will be happy about it.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.178
If cops are visible
and they're doing their jobs.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.658
What about the police unions?

05:54.658 --> 05:56.007
They gonna be happy about it?

05:56.007 --> 05:57.226
They definitely will not
be happy about it,

05:57.226 --> 05:58.706
but they can be managed.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.535
I am counting on those unions
for their support, John.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.188
This is not just
a matter of managing.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.016
Increased
police presence.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.018
I mean, if it's
effective...

06:07.018 --> 06:08.629
that's not a bad thing
to run for mayor on.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.067
Your Inspector Haywood is not
the one running for mayor.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.765
If what she's proposing
is successful

06:14.765 --> 06:16.201
and has community buy-in,

06:16.201 --> 06:18.813
there'll be enough
credit to go around.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.033
And if she's not successful,
there will also be enough blame.

06:30.694 --> 06:31.652
Uh...

06:31.652 --> 06:32.696
Hello?
That's it.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.350
Hola? Uh...

06:34.350 --> 06:35.743
Good boy.[Morales clapping] Hola.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.961
I think
you should find

06:36.961 --> 06:39.094
- another place for Fido.
- I'm sorry.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.313
He's still having
separation issues.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.837
Likes to keep me in sight.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.795
Okay...
Oh!

06:44.795 --> 06:46.449
Dr. Ken Corley.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.581
Uh...

06:47.581 --> 06:49.452
From the medical examiner's
office.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.628
Uh, Detective Morales.
This is Detective Killian.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.021
It's a pleasure.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.718
Inspector Haywood speaks
very highly of you.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.459
Oh, Regina.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.982
She's actually the
one who convinced me

06:57.982 --> 06:59.593
to come back to all this.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
After Cindy passed,

07:01.464 --> 07:03.379
I thought I
needed a break.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.686
Tried upstate,
Schoharie County.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.123
Beautiful place.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.038
But not a lot of
crime scenes.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.779
And not a lot of corpses.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.607
Hey.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.826
You guys here for me?

07:19.656 --> 07:21.136
Careful.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.841
Uh...

07:30.841 --> 07:32.277
Anything?

07:32.277 --> 07:33.757
Initially, we were thinking
acetone flashover

07:33.757 --> 07:35.237
with electrical origins

07:35.237 --> 07:37.108
because, you know, the wirings
are usually a rat's nest

07:37.108 --> 07:38.719
in these old buildings.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.635
But... then we found this.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.985
What's that?

07:43.985 --> 07:45.160
Spalling.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.509
Caused by

07:46.509 --> 07:48.685
expansion or contraction
of the concrete.

07:48.685 --> 07:51.340
Usually indicating
the use of an accelerant.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.950
So, arson.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.430
In most cases.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.954
It's no longer considered dispositive.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.261
So not like an
empty gas can?

07:59.261 --> 08:01.132
Well, uh, actually...

08:01.132 --> 08:03.613
we have some new
toys these days.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.267
Tandem spectrometry.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.834
Pretty good at determining

08:06.834 --> 08:08.836
which chemicals
shouldn't be here.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.099
And that is
the remains of a safe.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.361
Contents unclear.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.015
Okay,
so you're thinking

08:14.015 --> 08:16.800
our John Doe goes for the safe,
sets the fire to cover,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.498
and gets trapped
in his own blaze.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
Could be.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.719
Or the poor bastard could
just be collateral damage.

08:22.719 --> 08:23.851
Much as I hate to be

08:23.851 --> 08:25.026
the fella who always says,

08:25.026 --> 08:27.115
"We can't jump to conclusions,"

08:27.115 --> 08:31.032
it happens to be an especially
bad practice in fire cases.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.208
Things will always surprise you.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.296
All right, well,

08:34.296 --> 08:36.167
way I see it, we got two jobs.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.256
You help us ID our John Doe

08:38.256 --> 08:40.781
and we figure out who'd have
a motive to torch this place.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.305
Indeed. What did
Hal Holbrook say?

08:44.219 --> 08:46.047
"Follow the money."

08:46.047 --> 08:47.396
That's
what I'm thinking.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.702
Insurance.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.921
We're on it.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.534
Who the hell
is Hal Holbrook?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.887
All right, let's see.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.019
Take this maybe, yeah.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.718
Hey.
How you doing?

09:04.718 --> 09:06.894
I'm good.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.765
Um...

09:08.765 --> 09:11.072
How's Andre doing?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.335
He's doing okay.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.728
Just okay?

09:14.728 --> 09:16.904
What about when
- he's with you?
- Yeah, no, same.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.732
Hmm.
Um...

09:18.732 --> 09:20.124
A little shaky at times.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.430
But, you know... That's to be expected.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.953
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.346
You can't hurry up
the process, you know?

09:24.346 --> 09:25.434
I don't really think
that I'm doing that.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.435
Well, see...

09:26.435 --> 09:28.263
You know...

09:28.263 --> 09:29.612
Not everyone is cut out

09:29.612 --> 09:30.700
for this kind of work.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.180
You think that maybe he's not?

09:33.485 --> 09:34.704
We'll see.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.445
You're the one training him,
so I don't...

09:36.445 --> 09:37.794
I don't know,
you're in the best position

09:37.794 --> 09:39.056
to know if he is or isn't.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.581
Which is why I say...
we'll see.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.411
You know...

09:46.411 --> 09:47.935
I've been training him
a bit, myself.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.416
Spare me the details, please.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.853
Are you sure?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.637
Hey.
Hey.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.769
What's so funny?

09:55.769 --> 09:58.162
I was just showing
Marvin that, uh,

09:58.162 --> 10:00.208
that video of
the raccoon and bulldog.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.908
I love that one.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.431
- Yeah, that's funny.
- It's such a good one.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477
I knew he'd like it.
That's pretty good.

10:10.479 --> 10:13.961
♪ Baby

10:19.053 --> 10:21.795
This one, she says she wants
Ghana braid, 40-inch.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.405
But she bring--Hey.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.711
Can I help you?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.930
Yeah, we're detectives
from the 7-4 squad.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.845
We'd like to speak
with the owner.

10:28.845 --> 10:32.022
The owners are
Mohamed and Adama.

10:32.022 --> 10:35.025
They're in the back.
Please, follow me.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.334
Show me picture, yes?

10:39.334 --> 10:40.944
Mr. Gueye?

10:42.250 --> 10:45.209
Detectives Morales, Killian,
from the 7-4 squad.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.342
We're here to talk to
you about the fire.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.605
Mohamed Gueye.
My wife, Adama.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.693
We don't know yet

10:50.693 --> 10:51.694
whose body they find?

10:51.694 --> 10:52.826
Not yet.
It's looking like

10:52.826 --> 10:53.827
the fire might've been

10:53.827 --> 10:55.176
set, Mr. Gueye.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.265
Who does this kind of thing?

10:57.265 --> 10:58.701
That's what we're
hoping to find out.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
Yeah, how's your business doing?

11:00.485 --> 11:01.443
Okay.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.705
We expand from one location

11:02.705 --> 11:04.011
to three locations.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.316
So you still have two
up and running?

11:05.316 --> 11:06.840
Yes.
All right,

11:06.840 --> 11:07.841
we'll want contact information

11:07.841 --> 11:09.407
for your insurance carrier.

11:09.407 --> 11:12.802
You think we set fire
to our own business?

11:12.802 --> 11:14.151
It's standard to look
into the insurance policy

11:14.151 --> 11:15.587
in the case of arson.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.111
Is there
any employees

11:17.111 --> 11:18.460
you think we
should talk to?

11:18.460 --> 11:21.245
Is there anyone
you let go recently?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.162
The manager at
Dakar Salon #1.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.513
He steal from me. I fire him.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.559
We're gonna want
to talk to him. Yes.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.213
Do you have
his contact info?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.041
We have W2

11:34.041 --> 11:35.390
with an old address.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.174
He moved around
a lot of the time.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.741
We do everything legal.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.047
What's his name?

11:40.047 --> 11:41.570
Cheik Sy.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.180
23 years old.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.747
Came over from Senegal
when he was 12.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.227
You know, I was interested
to find there's upwards

11:46.227 --> 11:48.751
of 25,000 Senegalese
living in New York.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.752
He have a rap sheet?

11:49.752 --> 11:50.971
Yeah, one arrest

11:50.971 --> 11:52.015
for assault, said he, uh,

11:52.015 --> 11:53.234
threw a guy out of a salon

11:53.234 --> 11:54.801
for harassing one of the girls.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.324
Charges were dismissed.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.195
You need to talk to
some of the other employees,

11:58.195 --> 12:00.241
preferably not
with their bosses present.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.939
You know what language
they speak in Senegal?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.899
It's called Wolof.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.422
Never heard of that.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.427
<i>Foot patrols might sound
like a good idea,</i>

12:12.427 --> 12:13.776
<i>but you got to look
at the results.</i>

12:13.776 --> 12:15.691
Now, also worth noting

12:15.691 --> 12:17.867
the Knapp Commission says that

12:17.867 --> 12:21.131
putting cops on foot
inevitably leads to corruption.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.437
Hang on a minute.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.178
Solo foot posts may be
the worst idea

12:24.178 --> 12:25.614
to come down the pike
in a while.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.008
But it's not 'cause cops
are easily corrupted.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.444
It's 'cause cops get killed.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.881
Thanks to the reckless policy
put in place

12:31.881 --> 12:34.101
by Deputy Inspector
Regina Haywood--

12:34.101 --> 12:36.625
and I will call her out
by name--

12:36.625 --> 12:39.149
police officers are about
to become sitting ducks.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.238
We allow this to move forward,

12:41.238 --> 12:44.024
their blood
will be on her hands.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.809
Sharpe is having a meltdown.

12:46.809 --> 12:50.334
Look, he is willing
to support Haywood to a point.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.772
But he is not willing
to be the punching bag

12:52.772 --> 12:54.251
for the police union.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.210
Police unions adapt
to circumstances.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.647
There are all kinds of things
that they objected to

12:58.647 --> 12:59.909
when first introduced,

12:59.909 --> 13:01.302
ultimately they found
they could live with.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.174
You need to tell Haywood
that solo foot posts

13:04.174 --> 13:05.393
are a non-starter.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.221
I just gave her the go-ahead.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.833
Then tell her that you applaud
her taking the initiative

13:10.833 --> 13:12.443
but, uh, it warrants
further study.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.837
Sharpe wants to pull her back,
he tells her himself.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
That's not how
it works, John.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.319
Sharpe gets to be Santa

13:18.319 --> 13:19.842
and hand out the presents.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.844
Everything else,
we take care of.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.890
I never said
that I was down with him

13:23.890 --> 13:26.022
dictating departmental policy. No.

13:26.022 --> 13:29.156
Solo foot posts are a bad idea.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.202
The optics of
sending cops out into

13:32.202 --> 13:34.857
high-crime areas alone
is bad enough.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.164
Should one of
those cops get shot?

13:37.164 --> 13:38.600
They're disastrous.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.517
I suspect...

13:42.517 --> 13:46.608
that you can find an artful
way of letting the idea

13:46.608 --> 13:48.697
die a natural death.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.570
I thought you didn't know
anything about police work.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.878
I'm a quick study.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.365
You're not in any
trouble, Fatou.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.236
We just want to find out
what happened.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.064
Okay.
How well did you know

14:08.064 --> 14:10.850
the former salon
manager Cheik Sy?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.504
Not really so much.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.723
I just do my work.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.421
I don't deal so much with him.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.467
So, Cheik Sy was
your direct boss?

14:19.467 --> 14:20.468
Yes.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.686
Good boss, bad boss?

14:21.686 --> 14:22.862
Very good.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.776
You know why he was fired?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.213
I don't know this.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.954
Let me
ask you, um...

14:27.954 --> 14:30.739
think it's true
he stole the money?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.045
I don't think so.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.394
Do you know where
we can find him?

14:33.394 --> 14:35.570
Do you know where
we might find Cheik Sy?

14:35.570 --> 14:37.615
I don't know this.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.269
I know he with his sister
in Brownsville.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.228
We go to the same mosque.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.447
You ever see Cheik Sy
outside of work?

14:43.447 --> 14:46.494
Never.
Just to get to get
together after work?

14:46.494 --> 14:47.582
Or on holidays?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.931
I don't see him.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.585
I don't talk to him.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.629
I don't know.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.243
Killian.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.854
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

14:58.854 --> 15:02.597
So, I originally thought I could
get prints from the body

15:02.597 --> 15:05.382
using high-contrast
Mikrosil casting,

15:05.382 --> 15:07.515
which usually works.
In this case,

15:07.515 --> 15:08.951
not so much.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.171
So, I took a
shot and tried

15:11.171 --> 15:14.087
a post-mortem
computer tomography scan.

15:14.087 --> 15:18.439
Which enabled me to find...

15:19.831 --> 15:21.050
...these.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.618
Those are
- bullet fragments?
- No.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.141
Okay, so what are they?

15:27.404 --> 15:30.277
Burnt into the subderma
of the left nostril,

15:30.277 --> 15:33.802
and both right
and left lobules...

15:33.802 --> 15:35.108
Ah, piercings.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.544
Correct-a-mundo.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.113
Piercings that match

15:40.113 --> 15:41.766
these piercings.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.204
Ah. Yes.

15:44.204 --> 15:47.337
Well, that's who
we've been looking for.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.645
Question is, was it
an accident or murder?

16:04.093 --> 16:05.877
We're sorry for
your loss, Safara.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.924
But we have to ask
you a few questions.

16:08.924 --> 16:11.013
And we think Cheik
died in the fire.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.928
What are you saying?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.191
We know he was fired
recently for stealing.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.107
We think he may have started the
fire and been unable to get out.

16:18.107 --> 16:21.502
My brother don't steal.
My brother don't set fire.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.896
Is it possible he kept it
from you that he was stealing?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.684
He start acting different.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.773
Start staying out late,

16:31.773 --> 16:33.340
not telling me
where he was going.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.603
He was on the phone
all the time.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.388
Who was he on the phone
with, do you know?

16:39.781 --> 16:41.000
It would be a big help.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.048
I looked at his phone

16:46.048 --> 16:48.268
to see who he was talking
to every night.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.966
I-I wrote it down,

16:50.966 --> 16:53.577
but I was too scared
to ask him about it.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.278
Everyone love him.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.549
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.075
Don Jankowicz called.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.424
He wants a face-to-face meeting.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.035
We've also heard from
the Sergeant's Union.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.558
They want the same thing.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.039
Schedule something
with the both of them.
Hold on.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.346
Do you want to wait

17:23.346 --> 17:25.566
on implementing
the solo foot posts

17:25.566 --> 17:27.046
before you meet with them?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.960
I do not.
I'll speak to their concerns,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.050
but this doesn't hinge
on their approval.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.921
I think it's probably best
if I couch that

17:32.921 --> 17:34.575
in diplomatic terms

17:34.575 --> 17:36.620
before I respond
to them.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.926
Look, I believe in
what you're doing,

17:37.926 --> 17:39.319
I understand why
you're doing it.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.843
I'm just afraid that
the forces arrayed against you

17:41.843 --> 17:43.627
may be overwhelming.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.239
I expect to have the support
of Chief Suarez.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.805
If it's politically advantageous,

17:47.805 --> 17:50.852
I expect to have the support
of Deputy Mayor Sharpe.

17:50.852 --> 17:54.029
I also just might
have the support

17:54.029 --> 17:56.945
of the people who live
in East New York.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.947
And you have me.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.559
And I have you.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.963
We got to go slow
on the solo foot posts.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.101
Slow as in forget it?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.798
I didn't say that.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.235
To introduce something
out of the blue

18:26.235 --> 18:29.630
with no recent data, with no
studies having been conducted...

18:29.630 --> 18:32.546
I think you're making it
unnecessarily, uh,

18:32.546 --> 18:34.330
difficult on yourself.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.855
Let me ask you
a question, Chief--

18:37.855 --> 18:40.162
what changedbetween

18:40.162 --> 18:42.033
this morning and now?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.339
What changed is
that I had the time

18:43.339 --> 18:45.472
to think about
what you want to do

18:45.472 --> 18:47.517
and to confer with people
about it.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.912
Would one of those people
be Raymond Sharpe?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.566
As a matter of fact, it would.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.438
Let me guess. He doesn't
want to piss off the unions.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.354
There are consequences
to pissing off the unions.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.313
And they're not just
political consequences.

19:00.313 --> 19:03.098
It goes to how willing
cops are to take direction.

19:03.098 --> 19:06.275
It affects the way they do their
jobs when no one's looking.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.711
You can't just ignore
those things

19:07.711 --> 19:09.017
and make like they don't exist.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.801
Is that why you went
behind my back

19:10.801 --> 19:13.761
to convince
Internal Affairs

19:13.761 --> 19:15.589
not to conduct an investigation

19:15.589 --> 19:17.504
into Gabe Finley?

19:17.504 --> 19:19.332
Regina, it didn't warrant
an investigation.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.552
That doesn't come from Raymond
Sharpe or the police unions.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.859
This is your
- determination, right?
- Yeah.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.991
My determination.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.124
I want to know
who I'm dealing with.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.908
You're dealing with
the same person you dealt with

19:30.908 --> 19:32.562
since he was a patrol sergeant.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.435
What would happen
if I went ahead

19:35.435 --> 19:37.611
with the solo
foot posts?

19:39.569 --> 19:41.876
You'd be disobeying
a direct order

19:41.876 --> 19:45.227
and, in all likelihood, you'd
be stripped of your command.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.883
You're doing
a good job here, Regina.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.886
I don't think
you want that to happen.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.153
<i>The problem, Fatou,</i>

19:58.153 --> 20:00.242
is that when you lie
to us about one thing,

20:00.242 --> 20:02.549
we have to assume you're
lying to us about everything.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.159
What do I lie about?

20:04.159 --> 20:06.074
Well, not talking
to Cheik Sy, for starters.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.554
His sister said
you talked to him every day.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.034
She don't want
I talk to him at all.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.167
That's why I don't say anything.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.690
Why's doesn't she want you
to talk to him at all?

20:13.690 --> 20:15.475
Jealousy.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.086
Also, my boyfriend's jealous.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.087
What's your
boyfriend's name?

20:19.087 --> 20:21.263
Why is that important?

20:21.263 --> 20:24.266
Because we have to
verify your story, Fatou.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.835
His name's Tarique.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.358
Where can we find him?

20:35.059 --> 20:37.018
Tarique Niang?

20:38.149 --> 20:39.281
What's up?

20:39.281 --> 20:41.196
Detectives Killian
and Morales.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.242
We'd like to talk to you
about Cheik Sy.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.460
What about him?

20:44.460 --> 20:45.766
Were you aware
that your girlfriend

20:45.766 --> 20:47.028
was in a relationship with him?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.900
This is America, right?

20:49.900 --> 20:51.554
Fatou can do what she wants.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.774
Thanks for the civics lesson,
but according to your girlfriend

20:53.774 --> 20:54.905
you're the jealous type.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.864
She say that?

20:56.864 --> 20:58.344
Mm.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
Where were you when
the hair salon caught fire?

21:00.128 --> 21:02.435
Here. I was working.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.827
So I could go in there,

21:03.827 --> 21:05.307
talk to your supervisor

21:05.307 --> 21:06.961
and get them
to pull your timecard

21:06.961 --> 21:07.962
showing when you punched in

21:07.962 --> 21:08.963
and when you punched out, right?

21:08.963 --> 21:09.964
Do it, yeah.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.792
Oh, we will.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.489
I can't believe you'd think
I was jealous of Cheik.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.796
Why is that so
hard to believe?

21:15.796 --> 21:17.363
He don't even like girls.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.456
Tom Killian.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.935
You open the attachment
I sent you?

21:26.372 --> 21:27.764
Yeah, it's coming
through now.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.462
A coronal reconstruction

21:29.462 --> 21:32.769
showing deep laterocervical
wound with clean edges.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.249
Yeah. In English, please.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.599
Cheik Sy was stabbed
in the neck.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.209
Judging from the wound,

21:38.209 --> 21:42.039
he was dead <i>before</i> the place
went up in flames.

21:42.039 --> 21:45.216
In which case, the fire
was set by someone else.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.275
These scissors were
found near the body.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.625
Edge consistent with
Cheik's stab wound.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.713
No usable prints, though.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.019
No usable prints.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.281
Well, fire will do that.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.587
Tarique also took a collar

22:07.587 --> 22:08.675
for menacing with a knife.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.198
Hey.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.853
I got hold of Cheik Sy's
credit card statements.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.071
It seems as though
he hits a place

22:14.071 --> 22:15.682
called the Toolbar

22:15.682 --> 22:17.248
out on Long Island
about twice a week.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.946
And we know what
kind of place it is?

22:18.946 --> 22:20.208
It's a gay place, Tommy.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.731
- It's a gay bar.
- All right.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.168
So he has a girlfriend
and he a frequents a gay bar.

22:24.168 --> 22:26.388
In and of itself,
nothing extraordinary.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.869
But we don't know how
prevalent bisexuality is

22:28.869 --> 22:31.045
in the Senegalese community.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.090
We could also allow
for the possibility

22:33.090 --> 22:34.657
that his girlfriend
isn't really his girlfriend.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.398
I might bet on that
one first, Captain.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.966
So Tarique and Fatou
are both lying.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.882
We should put a tail on them.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.492
Do it.

22:45.581 --> 22:46.930
<i>Thanks for coming in.</i>

22:46.930 --> 22:48.410
I don't get summoned

22:48.410 --> 22:51.108
to a precinct commander's
office all that often.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.328
Had to know what it was about.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.070
What it's about
is putting more

22:56.070 --> 22:58.420
cops on high-visibility
foot posts.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.336
We'll still have six
to eight sector cars,

23:01.336 --> 23:03.425
but we'll rotate
enough cops on each tour

23:03.425 --> 23:06.341
to have cops walking
a steady beat as well.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.256
Don't tell me you're actually
consulting with me

23:08.256 --> 23:10.563
about how to deploy
your officers.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.086
I listened
to your podcast

23:12.086 --> 23:14.393
and you have had a lot to say

23:14.393 --> 23:16.569
about police funding
and tactics,

23:16.569 --> 23:20.137
about the role police play
in the life of the community.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.792
So, because you are
listened to in the community,

23:22.792 --> 23:24.403
I want to know

23:24.403 --> 23:27.057
whether you endorse putting
more cops on the street

23:27.057 --> 23:28.407
who actually get to know

23:28.407 --> 23:30.757
the people they serve.
And if you do,

23:30.757 --> 23:33.150
I want you to broadcast that.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.638
<i>I used to like</i>

23:42.638 --> 23:44.205
being on foot posts.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.120
Now, when I think of it,

23:46.120 --> 23:47.469
the only thing
comes to mind

23:47.469 --> 23:50.167
is me freezing my ass
off in wintertime

23:50.167 --> 23:53.344
and how my feet will be
hurting all year long.

23:53.344 --> 23:56.260
I wouldn't mind a foot post.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.392
What do you think,
it'll be like Mike the Cop

23:57.392 --> 23:58.654
on <i>Abbott and Costello</i>?

23:59.481 --> 24:02.658
Hey. I-I don't know who
any of those people are.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.530
That was the image
of the cops back then.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.446
You know, two rows of brass
buttons up your choker,

24:07.446 --> 24:09.796
you know, twirling
your shillelagh.

24:09.796 --> 24:12.451
Your what?
Your shillelagh.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.974
- That's the billy club.
- Oh, okay.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.976
He knows everybody,
everybody knows him.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.238
How fast you think
you're gonna get

24:17.238 --> 24:18.631
to the crime scene on foot?

24:18.631 --> 24:21.851
I mean, obviously a radio car
gets you there faster.

24:23.592 --> 24:27.161
Ah, doesn't matter,
radio car or foot post.

24:27.161 --> 24:31.861
You can't show up to the
party late, either way.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.777
What are you trying
to say, Marvin?

24:34.777 --> 24:38.477
Are you gonna tell me how long
it was that you waited outside

24:38.477 --> 24:42.002
while we were set up on
that marijuana dispensary?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.220
It was a few minutes,
I don't know.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.526
Does it...
does it matter?

24:44.526 --> 24:46.223
It might've.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.531
Why are you throwing this
up to me now?

24:49.531 --> 24:51.098
Because I said to you

24:51.098 --> 24:54.667
that what mattered was that
you eventually went inside,

24:54.667 --> 24:57.191
but that was wrong.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.367
What really matters is
that you left me in there

24:59.367 --> 25:02.109
one second longer
than you had to.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.984
I'm sorry.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.467
Heads up.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.339
We have movement
on Tarique and Fatou.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.699
All units, they're traveling.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.310
We will distant follow.

25:31.442 --> 25:34.924
We're heading into the Warehouse
District in Long Island City.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.411
7-4 squad
in position.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.500
They pulled
over on 29th Street.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.633
Seems like
they're waiting for something.

25:49.765 --> 25:53.247
Heads up, Morales.
There's a truck coming your way.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.219
All units, eyes open.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.094
What the hell
are they doing?

26:15.051 --> 26:16.313
I don't know.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.755
Tarique and Fatou
are on the move.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.234
We'll follow on foot.

26:44.515 --> 26:48.650
<i>Are they trafficking people?</i>

26:52.045 --> 26:54.482
- We got to move.
- All units, move in.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.659
Police!

26:57.659 --> 26:58.660
Freeze!

26:58.660 --> 26:59.879
I got this one.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.576
Up against the van!
Right now!

27:07.843 --> 27:09.062
Police! Don't move!

27:09.062 --> 27:10.803
Stop! Keep your
hands up, don't run!

27:10.803 --> 27:11.804
Turn around.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.414
Police! Freeze!

27:13.414 --> 27:15.372
Stay right there.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.465
Put your left arm
behind your back.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.424
So, what, this is some kind of

27:23.424 --> 27:24.686
work off your debt
till you die plan?

27:28.821 --> 27:30.083
Okay.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.954
Is the translator here yet?

27:31.954 --> 27:33.347
What do we have?

27:33.347 --> 27:35.131
Modern-day slavery.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.567
The women were promised jobs

27:36.567 --> 27:38.352
to help take care of their
families back in Senegal.

27:38.352 --> 27:41.224
- Here's a blanket.
- Really, they
were being trafficked.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.835
- Salon workers?
- Probably.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.880
They end up working
14 hours a day,

27:44.880 --> 27:46.882
then have to kick back
to their traffickers.

27:46.882 --> 27:49.711
Where are you
- getting this from?
- Her name is Fatou Diop.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.365
She was friends
with that guy

27:51.365 --> 27:52.758
that was burned
up in the salon.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
She and her boyfriend
Tarique led us here.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.240
He was filming what
was going down.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.807
Hi, Ms. Diop, I'm Deputy
Inspector Haywood.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.723
How'd you come
to know Cheik Sy?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.203
I told him my secret

28:03.203 --> 28:04.857
and he told me his.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.033
His secret being
that he was gay.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.383
His parents sent him
and his sister

28:09.383 --> 28:12.865
to America as soon
as they realized it.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.563
In Senegal, he would
have been put to death.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.565
Why didn't you tell
my detectives this

28:17.565 --> 28:19.306
when they first questioned you?

28:21.003 --> 28:23.179
If they would kill Cheik,

28:23.179 --> 28:26.574
a citizen of this country...

28:26.574 --> 28:29.142
what would they do
to illegals like us?

28:29.142 --> 28:30.665
What would who do?

28:30.665 --> 28:32.711
Mohamed and Adama.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.408
The owners of the salon
where you work.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.236
They took our passports away.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.759
Told us never, ever

28:37.759 --> 28:40.414
tell the truth about
how we came to be here.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.112
Or they would take it out
on our families back home.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.245
I was too scared

28:45.245 --> 28:47.464
to say their names out loud.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.772
You don't have
to be scared anymore.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.217
<i>Earlier...</i>

29:01.217 --> 29:02.349
when you and Sandeford
were talking

29:02.349 --> 29:04.655
in the breakroom
and I walked in,

29:04.655 --> 29:07.789
you weren't talking about
some funny video, were you?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.532
No.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.276
I asked him
how you were doing.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.625
If you want to
know how I'm doing,

29:17.625 --> 29:20.106
you should ask me
how I'm doing.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.325
But I do ask you,
all the time.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.458
I don't want to be
asked all the time.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.417
Okay. Okay,
so I won't ask you.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.289
That's not... That's
not what I'm saying.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.160
I just don't want to be
looked at with concern.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.554
Okay? And I don't
people wondering

29:33.554 --> 29:36.339
if I'm all right. If anybody
asks you, tell them I'm fine.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.820
Okay. Why are you
yelling at me?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.691
I'm sorry.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.958
Andre, what...

29:45.958 --> 29:47.786
What can I do?

29:50.179 --> 29:51.702
Nothing.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.403
Okay.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.825
Jay, you're the one
who's going to be

30:26.825 --> 30:29.175
handling this case on
the prosecution side.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.567
Do you have
enough, as of now,

30:30.567 --> 30:32.352
to bring trafficking
charges against

30:32.352 --> 30:34.702
both the husband and wife,
the salon owners?

30:34.702 --> 30:37.531
McBRIDE: We do,
but trafficking prosecutions

30:37.531 --> 30:39.402
are complicated and messy.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.448
The defense
is sure to raise

30:41.448 --> 30:43.319
the consent issue and there are

30:43.319 --> 30:45.626
jurisdictional issues
between state and federal.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.889
Yeah, homicide
prosecutions easier for you?

30:47.889 --> 30:51.501
It isn't a matter of easier, Detective.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.155
There are fewer moving parts.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.114
What are the chances

30:55.114 --> 30:56.724
we get the couple to go for it?

30:56.724 --> 30:58.508
Well, I'd say, uh,
there's a better chance

30:58.508 --> 31:00.206
we get the wife to flip
on her husband.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.556
Keep in mind
there's a time factor.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.907
They find a judge who lets them
post bail, they're gone.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.517
Okay.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.137
First-time mayoral candidate

31:18.137 --> 31:22.271
seen frequenting Goody's.

31:23.403 --> 31:24.621
Might be a good thing.

31:25.796 --> 31:26.710
Take a look at this.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.799
Okay.

31:28.799 --> 31:32.412
How can there be trust between
the police and the people

31:32.412 --> 31:34.849
when the totality
of the relationship

31:34.849 --> 31:36.982
is drive-by or bust?

31:36.982 --> 31:39.854
The answer is: there can't be.

31:39.854 --> 31:42.204
Which is why
Deputy Inspector Haywood's plan

31:42.204 --> 31:45.904
to expand foot patrols
is a good plan.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.862
You used to know them,
you could talk to 'em.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.517
When it's a familiar face,
that's who you go to.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.040
If I'm walking by you every day,

31:52.040 --> 31:53.955
if I know your name, there's
a whole lot better chance

31:53.955 --> 31:55.348
that we're gonna come
to an understanding.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.002
You feel what I'm saying?

31:57.002 --> 31:58.438
It's just common sense.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.962
The police union can be
counted on to oppose it,

32:00.962 --> 32:03.443
but let whoever's gonna
be our next mayor

32:03.443 --> 32:04.923
walk through neighborhoods like

32:04.923 --> 32:08.230
Cambria Heights or-or Mott Haven
or East New York

32:08.230 --> 32:10.276
and they will find
there are few things

32:10.276 --> 32:15.237
as welcome and effective as
getting cops out of their cars.

32:15.237 --> 32:18.632
80,000 hits and counting.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.200
I thought you were
gonna take care of this.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.767
I spoke to Inspector Haywood.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.291
She put her plans

32:25.291 --> 32:27.293
for solo foot posts on hold.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.642
She have anything to do

32:28.642 --> 32:29.730
with this guy running off
at the mouth?

32:29.730 --> 32:30.949
I have no idea.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.994
It's not as though

32:32.994 --> 32:34.300
she's the first or only one

32:34.300 --> 32:36.476
to advance the merits
of foot posts.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.173
Or solo foot posts,
for that matter.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.306
It puts Raymond
in a tough spot.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.438
No, I understand.

32:42.438 --> 32:45.180
As long as Haywood
holds off on solo foot posts,

32:45.180 --> 32:46.573
there's nothing new.

32:46.573 --> 32:49.271
I got to take a position.
That's what's new.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.056
I have to answer questions.
All while I'm trying to

32:51.056 --> 32:54.059
negotiate with the police union
for their endorsement.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.191
Did I need this?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.324
I told you

32:58.324 --> 33:00.065
there are things
I can do,

33:00.065 --> 33:01.675
there are things
that I can't do.

33:01.675 --> 33:04.243
So long as it isn't contrary
to departmental policy,

33:04.243 --> 33:06.462
I won't supersede

33:06.462 --> 33:09.117
a commanding officer's authority
to deploy her officers

33:09.117 --> 33:10.771
as she sees fit.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.382
I would have preferred

33:13.382 --> 33:14.862
to control the timing of this.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.037
But I think it might be possible

33:16.037 --> 33:17.691
to turn it to our advantage.

33:17.691 --> 33:18.692
How so?

33:18.692 --> 33:19.954
How's this?

33:19.954 --> 33:21.303
"I would support

33:21.303 --> 33:23.523
"whatever deployment
approach proves itself

33:23.523 --> 33:26.830
"to be most effective,
cost-efficient, and...

33:26.830 --> 33:30.182
doesn't sacrifice
the safety of our officers."

33:37.058 --> 33:38.146
You.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.148
Huh?

33:40.148 --> 33:41.845
She's good.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.499
Yeah, she's good.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.548
Gorée Island.
Do you know it?

33:48.548 --> 33:51.812
Everyone in Senegal
knows Gorée Island.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.901
20 million Africans passed
through in chains,

33:53.901 --> 33:55.120
forced into slavery.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.556
I know this.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.340
You and your husband
didn't need chains.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.516
You brought these women here,

34:00.516 --> 34:01.996
lied to them about jobs,

34:01.996 --> 34:03.302
took away their passports.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.391
They were your slaves.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.526
They were not slaves.

34:14.095 --> 34:15.357
Sit down.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.098
I want to talk
to my husband now. Huh?

34:17.098 --> 34:18.360
He can't help you, Adama.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.666
Now sit down.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.673
Anything, Doctor?

34:26.673 --> 34:28.849
You find any evidence
as to how Cheik Sy was killed?

34:28.849 --> 34:29.980
Quite a bit.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.417
And all very conclusive,

34:31.417 --> 34:32.679
I'd say.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.028
Radiological scans

34:34.028 --> 34:37.684
combined with cyanoacrylate
fuming measurements.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.121
And most importantly,
both eccrine

34:40.121 --> 34:42.210
and apocrine function

34:42.210 --> 34:43.907
showing sebaceous oils

34:43.907 --> 34:46.301
in a grabbing pattern.

34:48.042 --> 34:51.132
Dr. Corley is with
the medical examiner's office.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.787
They lifted your husband's
fingerprints

34:53.787 --> 34:56.137
from the scissors
he stabbed Cheik Sy with.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.140
Have a pleasant afternoon.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.275
Bravo, Doctor.

35:07.496 --> 35:08.802
I don't know
what you just said,

35:08.802 --> 35:10.151
but I'm guessing you know
what happened

35:10.151 --> 35:11.239
in the salon that night.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.154
Take us through it, Adama.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.461
Tell us the truth.
Maybe we can help you.

35:15.461 --> 35:18.638
How can you help me, hmm?

35:19.682 --> 35:21.336
Well, if you didn't
kill anybody,

35:21.336 --> 35:23.773
if you weren't bringing
workers in illegally,

35:23.773 --> 35:25.558
you might get off light.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.651
My husband...

35:31.651 --> 35:34.915
bring girls over to work
in the salons.

35:34.915 --> 35:38.962
Sometimes he bring girls over
to work for other people.

35:38.962 --> 35:40.747
Cheik...

35:41.878 --> 35:43.184
...he start

35:43.184 --> 35:44.838
to ask questions.

35:44.838 --> 35:47.188
"What kind of jobs?"

35:47.188 --> 35:48.929
"How much they pay?"
"Is it legal?"

35:48.929 --> 35:51.453
"Is it illegal?"

35:51.453 --> 35:54.456
My husband, he say, "This is
none of your business."

35:54.456 --> 35:55.762
Cheik...

35:55.762 --> 35:59.026
he talked to the girls,
get them all worried.

35:59.026 --> 36:03.857
Now they start asking questions.

36:03.857 --> 36:04.858
We meet...

36:04.858 --> 36:07.121
Cheik that night

36:07.121 --> 36:09.993
and my husband
offered him money...

36:09.993 --> 36:12.170
to stop.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.260
He called us <i>toubab.</i>

36:15.260 --> 36:17.131
What is that?

36:17.131 --> 36:19.351
A white person.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.570
A slave master.

36:22.658 --> 36:26.271
They were in the basement,
but I could hear them yelling.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.577
When I came downstairs,

36:28.577 --> 36:31.232
Cheik was lying on the floor,

36:31.232 --> 36:34.583
bleeding from his neck.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.412
Who started the fire
to cover it up?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.242
My husband do.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.593
He say it's the only way.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.864
I just read over her
statement, it looks good.

36:54.864 --> 36:58.390
Yeah, Dr. Corley here put on
a masterful performance.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.261
And there's nothing
that'll be challenged in court?

37:00.261 --> 37:01.697
Absolutely not.

37:01.697 --> 37:05.048
I pride myself on coming
right up to the line

37:05.048 --> 37:06.093
but never going over it.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.268
Yeah, he implied

37:07.268 --> 37:08.835
that there were
usable fingerprints

37:08.835 --> 37:10.445
found on
the murder weapon.

37:10.445 --> 37:14.754
Statements made in reliance,
thereon totally admissible.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.103
I'm familiar with

37:16.103 --> 37:17.278
Dr. Corley's
approach.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.237
We go back a long ways.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.109
Yes, we do, my dear,
yes, we do.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.243
I'm, uh, I'm sorry
about your wife.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.983
What?

37:26.983 --> 37:28.289
Oh, my God,
is she okay?

37:28.289 --> 37:29.682
She's fine.

37:29.682 --> 37:32.162
Uh, she-she's with a book group
up in Reykjavik.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.426
Yesterday, we-we
thought that you,

37:34.426 --> 37:37.124
you said she
- passed away.
- Yeah, you did.

37:37.124 --> 37:41.259
No, I-I said Cindy
passed away.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.086
Cindy was his dog.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.827
Oh, a dog.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.960
She lived to be...

37:46.960 --> 37:48.962
19.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.138
Oh, so cute.
I'm sorry for your loss.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.270
That's a beautiful animal.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.445
I hope she didn't suffer.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.056
Oh, thank you, I...

37:56.056 --> 37:57.449
I'm still getting over it.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.755
But the puppy you met
yesterday is helping.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.843
Okay.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.675
Whenever you're ready, Chief.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.068
Thanks.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.245
Hey, not ideal if you're
staking me out.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.682
I've been known
to be pretty determined.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.336
So, um...

38:15.336 --> 38:19.384
in light of our previous
conversation today,

38:19.384 --> 38:22.256
I thought we might
review the bidding.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.953
- Okay.
- It occurs to me

38:23.953 --> 38:26.347
that I might've been
selling a little too hard.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.610
Selling Raymond to me
or me to Raymond?

38:28.610 --> 38:31.265
Probably both.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.962
I-I get that you're worried
that he could

38:32.962 --> 38:34.660
conceivably be defeated.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.009
What are you
worried about with me?

38:36.009 --> 38:37.402
That I'll be, uh...

38:37.402 --> 38:39.665
disillusioned by the whole
political process?

38:39.665 --> 38:40.666
Disillusioned,

38:40.666 --> 38:42.232
depressed.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.234
Ultimately...

38:44.234 --> 38:46.585
chewed up and spit out.

38:46.585 --> 38:47.368
Oh.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.023
I'm, uh...

38:50.023 --> 38:51.851
I'm a big boy, uh...

38:51.851 --> 38:54.027
I know.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.464
I'm going into this
- with my eyes wide open.
- Why?

38:56.464 --> 38:58.901
Why are you doing this?

38:58.901 --> 39:03.384
Because I would want to be
police commissioner.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.344
Allison, I've been
a cop for 31 years.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.867
I've had a lot of responsibilities,

39:07.867 --> 39:08.911
a lot of
different commands.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.217
You know, the police

39:10.217 --> 39:14.177
department, as
an organization, uh...

39:14.177 --> 39:15.396
as an institution,

39:15.396 --> 39:17.703
it's something
that I know.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.661
I know how to lead.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.535
I-I would know how to lead it.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.754
So I would want that chance.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.541
Do you have dinner plans?

39:29.541 --> 39:32.152
I have to check
on a 4:00-to-12:00

39:32.152 --> 39:33.806
tour in one
of my precincts

39:33.806 --> 39:36.809
and then I have-- got a bunch
of phone calls that I need to...

39:36.809 --> 39:38.680
But do you have plans
for dinner?

39:38.680 --> 39:39.942
No.

39:40.769 --> 39:44.251
So, uh, we could have
dinner together?

39:44.251 --> 39:46.471
Long as it's not al fresco.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.168
It won't be.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.912
So, how are you today?

39:52.912 --> 39:54.566
I'm okay.

39:54.566 --> 39:55.741
Work good?

39:55.741 --> 39:58.221
At times, other
times not so good.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.049
But you're managing.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.269
I am.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.619
Psych Services
wanted you to

40:04.619 --> 40:07.187
check in with me once a month.

40:07.187 --> 40:10.408
But as far as I'm concerned,

40:10.408 --> 40:11.713
you're good to go.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.456
As far as being fit for duty?

40:15.456 --> 40:20.461
That's what Psych Services
is concerned with.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.466
What about me personally?

40:25.466 --> 40:28.121
I am happy to talk to you

40:28.121 --> 40:29.905
about whatever you want.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.387
I've been seeing someone.

40:33.387 --> 40:34.693
That a good thing?

40:34.693 --> 40:36.608
I want it to be.

40:37.826 --> 40:38.827
How did you meet?

40:38.827 --> 40:40.307
Through work.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.961
He's a cop?
Uh-huh.

40:41.961 --> 40:46.226
He's great looking
and smart, charming.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.575
He sounds horrible.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.751
I know, right?

40:49.751 --> 40:51.623
Are you not happy

40:51.623 --> 40:53.842
with the way
the relationship's going?

40:53.842 --> 40:56.236
He works undercover.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.020
Which means...

40:58.020 --> 41:00.414
his life depends on

41:00.414 --> 41:02.634
convincing very dangerous people

41:02.634 --> 41:04.810
that he's something he's not.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.203
Are you afraid he's doing
the same thing with you?

41:07.203 --> 41:08.857
It occurs to me.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.250
Why do you thinkthat is?

41:10.250 --> 41:13.383
Why do <i>you</i>
think that is?

41:13.383 --> 41:17.605
I think the fact
that your father

41:17.605 --> 41:20.478
did the same thing might have
something to do with it.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.306
You made it pretty clear you
didn't want to talk about

41:23.306 --> 41:25.874
your father,
so I hesitate...

41:25.874 --> 41:27.441
It's okay.

41:30.705 --> 41:34.274
I think that maybe it's time
that I do.
