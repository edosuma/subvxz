NEIL GAMBY:
Did somebody die in here?

00:13.041 --> 00:15.291
Uh, somebody actually did die.

00:15.291 --> 00:16.583
I'll take it.

LEE RUSSELL:
You all need a lesson

00:19.333 --> 00:22.208
in respecting your superiors.

00:22.208 --> 00:24.041
Is this about not wanting
to eat sushi?

00:24.041 --> 00:26.166
-(SHOUTING)
-Jesus Christ!

00:26.166 --> 00:27.417

Oh, come on.

You're not supposed to
pick up people here.

Perfect timing!

00:37.166 --> 00:39.125
SNODGRASS:
What you doing? Anything fun?

00:40.834 --> 00:42.959
Oh, my God. Is that
a whole binder of suspects?

00:42.959 --> 00:43.959
Oh, my God, yes it is.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.000
And you'd better be glad
I don't put Brian in here.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.291
Excuse me?

00:47.291 --> 00:49.375
Just keep your nose clean,
Snodgrass.

Excuse me, I'm looking

Nurse:
He's still in surgery.

You'll have to wait.

You're waiting
for Neal Gamby.

01:54.917 --> 01:56.500
Yes, yes, I am.
Is he okay?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.959
Awake and alert.
Oh, my God!

01:58.959 --> 02:00.750
Okay, that's great.
That's great!

Are you family?
Yes.

I'm his girlfriend.
May I see him, please?

Okay.

03:20.667 --> 03:21.917
I'm goin' to school.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.083
Dopers, get into class.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.500
Get the fuck into school.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.667
Robin, what the fuck?

03:26.667 --> 03:28.792
You're getting a second chance
and you're already
gonna blow it?

03:28.792 --> 03:31.208
I mean, what are these
clothes you're wearing
on your first day back?

03:31.208 --> 03:32.959
These are my clothes.
It's all I have.

03:32.959 --> 03:34.500
Leave me alone, okay?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.625
You gotta show people
that you're ready to do this
for real this time,

03:36.625 --> 03:38.291
not be some goddamn
slack-jawed fuck-up!

03:38.291 --> 03:39.834
When are you gonna
stop being an asshole?

03:39.834 --> 03:41.750
Hey, watch your mouth.
You hear me?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.542
You should be
kissing my asshole.

03:43.542 --> 03:44.792
Don't make me look
like an idiot.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.375
Fuck off. I won't.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.208
Okay, good, good.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.500
You got lunch money?
No.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.625
Didn't think so.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.083
Give this meal pass
to Dayshawn in the cafeteria.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.333

you need, okay?

03:58.125 --> 03:59.500
Get in there.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Don't do drugs!

04:03.000 --> 04:05.458
Ah, this is so exciting!

04:05.458 --> 04:08.291
I can already tell that
I like you guys so much better

04:08.291 --> 04:10.041
than that last batch
of teachers.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.333
Why so many
new teachers at once?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.208
Was there a walkout
or somethin'?

04:14.208 --> 04:16.083
No, no, no.
No walkout.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.834
Just some folks...

04:17.834 --> 04:21.625
with some toxic attitudes
who needed to be let go.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.291
I always strive
for the best.

04:23.291 --> 04:25.166
We are a very happy

04:25.166 --> 04:27.583
and successful institution.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.125
What's this?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.625
This looks like you.

04:41.583 --> 04:42.875
"King Ding-a Ling"?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.375
Look how tiny they made
your tee-tee bird.

04:44.375 --> 04:46.750
Fuck you, Gamby.
I-- No, I know
it's offensive,

04:46.750 --> 04:48.041
but it's a pretty good
picture of you.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.000
Obviously whoever did this
is really good at art.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.208
Who do you think it was?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.500
Some anonymous coward hid it
out in the trophy case,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.875
meaning someone
with a key.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.709
Meaning a faculty member
tried to make me look

04:57.709 --> 04:59.667
like an asshole
in front of the new hires.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.625
A caricature is supposed
to look like a person.

05:02.625 --> 05:06.041
You give Streisand
a big nose. Why? Ms. Swift?

05:06.041 --> 05:08.750
Because she has
a big fucking nose!

05:08.750 --> 05:09.875
That's why!

05:09.875 --> 05:12.542
Now why would they draw
my dick so little? Huh?

05:12.542 --> 05:13.875
I don't want to offend
you, Russell,

05:13.875 --> 05:15.792
but maybe you come off
like the type of guy

05:15.792 --> 05:18.333
that has a...
small, itty-bitty penis.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.083
Oh, whatever, Gamby.

05:20.083 --> 05:22.625
I'm sure yours is
so long and thick and juicy

05:22.625 --> 05:23.875
with big, fuckin' hairy balls.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.291
I bet you got a lot
of little Gambys

05:25.291 --> 05:27.208
swimmin' around in there,
ready to come out, right?

05:27.208 --> 05:28.542
I'm so fucking sure, Gamby.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.750
I don't have people
imagining that it's small.
(chuckles)

05:30.750 --> 05:32.959
Mocked by underlings.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.000
No more.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.417
Startin' right now,
I'm placing you

05:35.417 --> 05:36.875
as a substitute
for Bill Hayden's class.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.625
Are you nuts?
Come on, Russell.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.750
That's beneath my dignity.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.250
I haven't been able
to fill the spot yet.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.417
Besides, you can act
as my spy.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.000
Let me know what
the teachers are up to.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.083
I'm sorry, Gamby,
but you're going undercover.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.709
I-- I got my hands full
with my own job.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.375
Nash can't handle
discipline on her own.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.208
We just let
Robin Shandrell back in.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.792
She's not ready
for a guy like that.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.875
I can take the kid.
I got a few moves.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.166
Nash, you got dick.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.208
I saw your moves
in the parking lot today.
It was pathetic.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.750
Gamby, it's already
been decided.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.917
I need you to go in there
and substitute teach
the class, okay?

06:03.917 --> 06:06.583
God, this is so stupid.
This is bullshit!

06:06.583 --> 06:09.458
This is so dumb, Russell.
It's the dumbest thing.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.125
It's such bad judgment.
I don't like this choice.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.625
Excuse us, ladies.

06:18.875 --> 06:19.959
Close the door, please.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.000
(door closes)

06:21.000 --> 06:23.125
Buddy, don't you forget
that I'm your boss.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.959
Now, I can't have you
talking to me like that
in front of other people.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.166
I am the principal.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.250
Well, I was supposed
to be principal too, so--

06:29.250 --> 06:31.792
Yes. Then you got shot.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.583
And you hid out like a poor,
frightened little child.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.875
You were broken,
and I brought you back.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.500
Now, you will
substitute teach
that class, Neal Gamby.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.875
And you will find out
who's drawing

06:42.875 --> 06:46.250
fucked up cartoons
about my genitalia.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.500
Are we clear?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.625
I suppose.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.083
Don't make me ask again.

06:53.792 --> 06:55.166
Crystal.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.083
Dismissed.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.166
(school bell chimes)
Gamby: Okay,
here's the deal, people.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.792
I'm gonna be temporarily
subbing Honors History.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.333
So, someone please tell me,
what-- where are we at

07:06.333 --> 07:08.166
in the lesson plan?
Where-- where are we going?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.834
We're studying
the Reconstruction era,

07:09.834 --> 07:11.834
post-Civil War,
and its long-term effect

07:11.834 --> 07:13.667
on the Southern states.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.000
Okay. Cinchy.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.291
Uh, does Hayden have like a...
a master list of questions

07:18.291 --> 07:20.166
or like a... study guide
or anything?

07:20.166 --> 07:22.667
Mr. Hayden
just lectured mostly.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.875
Hm. That's one
technique of course,

07:24.875 --> 07:27.000
just to stand up there
and run your mouth.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.959
Uh, we're-- we're gonna put
a pin in Reconstruction

07:30.959 --> 07:33.667
and get a little more
creative with the learning.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.834
Here we go.
Got it.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.667
Does anyone know
what happened today in history?

07:37.667 --> 07:40.542
Give you a hint.
It happened in 1969.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.041
Anyone?

07:42.041 --> 07:44.792
Boris Karloff,
English actor and singer,

07:44.792 --> 07:48.375
b. 1887, he passed away
on this day in history.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.125
He was a famous person

07:50.125 --> 07:52.250
for playing the role
of Frankenstein

07:52.250 --> 07:54.792
in the classic
Universal monster film

07:54.792 --> 07:56.208
Frankenstein.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.083
So, what we're
gonna do is this.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.166
This is where
it gets fun.

08:00.166 --> 08:03.500
Take a piece of paper
and pass it around,
one to each.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.125
Today I want
your best artist renditions

08:06.125 --> 08:08.083
of Frankenstein.

08:08.083 --> 08:11.542
Do we draw
Frankenstein himself
or Frankenstein's monster?

08:11.542 --> 08:12.917
Frankenstein has a monster?

08:12.917 --> 08:14.333
(laughter)

08:14.333 --> 08:17.041
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.792
Draw Frankenstein, okay?

08:18.792 --> 08:20.375
Now where did Hayden keep
his Magic Markers?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.041
This is a college-level course.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.250
We don't have Magic Markers.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.500
(laughter)
Did you even go
to college?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.917
(scoffs)
Yes, I went to college.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.083
What school?

08:29.166 --> 08:30.709
Learning Leaders University.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.041
LLU. It's an online,
accredited university.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.709
(laughter)
What major?

08:34.709 --> 08:36.583
Leadership.
(laughs louder)

08:36.583 --> 08:38.375
What the hell is
so funny about that?

08:38.375 --> 08:39.583
I got into Penn State.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.959
I'm going to Duke.
Full ride.

08:41.959 --> 08:43.417
Well, big flippin' deal.
Who cares?

08:43.417 --> 08:45.583
(high-pitched voice)
What were your
SAT scores, Mr. Gamby?

08:45.583 --> 08:48.417
(mockingly)
Uh, I think my SAT scores
are none of your business.

08:48.417 --> 08:51.125
Look, just everyone shut
your mouths right now.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.667
Shut your...(mouths word)
mouths now.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.834
Just draw the motherfucker
with the bolts in his neck,
okay?

08:54.834 --> 08:57.250
Simple. Don't make
me say it again.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.250
Fuck, you guys are entitled.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.375
Unbelievable.

09:02.834 --> 09:06.041
Regina Deets!
Look at you with this...

09:06.041 --> 09:07.417
colorful ensemble.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.250
So creative!

09:09.250 --> 09:11.208
What an art teacher you are.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.667
What are
you workin' on next?

09:12.667 --> 09:14.125
In terms of my syllabus?

09:14.125 --> 09:17.291
No, sweetheart.
I'm talkin' you.

09:17.291 --> 09:21.458
Are you workin'
on any paintings
or illustrations?

09:21.458 --> 09:24.500
You came by
just to ask that?
Well, I'm just curious

09:24.500 --> 09:26.291
what you like
to work on yourself,

09:26.291 --> 09:27.875
you know,
when you're alone

09:27.875 --> 09:29.959
and you're feeling inspired.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.583
You know, like when
you want to make a statement.
Ugh.

09:32.583 --> 09:35.041
I did not draw
that comic strip,
if that's what you're asking.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.083
Comic strip?
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.583
What?
King Ding-a Ling.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.583
You know, the one
everyone's passing around
showcasing your...

09:41.583 --> 09:43.709
Who is passing it around?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.083
I don't know
who's doing it.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.333
Well, do you know
any other teachers
who like to draw?

09:47.333 --> 09:48.667
I'm a potter, Lee.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.834
I make pottery, remember?

09:50.834 --> 09:52.959
My show at the gallery,
you were there!

09:53.834 --> 09:55.834
Yes, that's right,
clay pots.

09:55.834 --> 09:57.709
I remember that.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.750
Well, it was good to...

09:59.750 --> 10:00.792
chat...

10:00.792 --> 10:02.750
with you, Regina.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.208
I look forward to...

10:04.208 --> 10:06.000
our next conversation...

10:07.250 --> 10:09.834
where we get to review
the art budget.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.667
Looking forward to that.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.166
Hey, Chief.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.583
You mind if I sit?

10:23.583 --> 10:25.709
What do you want?

10:25.709 --> 10:30.375
For some crazy reason,
Mr. Gamby has taken
a liking to you.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.000
If you disappoint him,

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
you're gonna have to deal
with the toughest MF-er
you've ever seen.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.417
Yeah? Who's that?

10:39.417 --> 10:40.417
Me.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.041
(sputters)
Oh, shit!

10:42.041 --> 10:43.834
Mr. Nash just farted!

10:43.834 --> 10:47.875
(laughter)

10:55.250 --> 10:57.834
How's it goin'? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

10:57.834 --> 10:59.375
What's up?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.875
You all are probably wondering
why I'm sitting with you.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.375
Well, I shall tell you.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.583
Lee Russell is an asshole.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.709
No shit.
Not exactly
breaking news, Gamby.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.125
Yeah, it's all
we've been talking about
for the last month.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.083
Well, good. Glad to see
I'm amongst friends.

11:15.083 --> 11:18.083
That way I can talk
as much shit as I want to, huh?

11:18.083 --> 11:19.667
What's your beef
with him, Gamby?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.667
My beef,
he's full of baloney.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.959
He's got me substitute teaching
Bill Hayden's history class.

11:24.959 --> 11:25.917
You?
What?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.250
Me.
Why can't he get
a real sub?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.667
Yeah, someone more qualified.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.542
"More qualified"?
Mm-hmm.

11:30.542 --> 11:31.709
(chuckles)

11:31.709 --> 11:33.458
You trying to knock on me?
Come on, Ms. Snodgrass.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.375
I'm overqualified.
This is a slap
in the face to me.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.250
Why is it a slap in the face
to teach class? Is there, uh,

11:38.250 --> 11:39.458
something wrong with teaching

11:39.458 --> 11:41.709
you wanna tell
this table of teachers?

11:41.709 --> 11:42.917
Well, n-- no.
I mean, there's--

11:42.917 --> 11:45.709
there's nothing wrong
with it for you guys.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.792
L-- look, I'm not trying
to insult anyone, okay?

11:47.792 --> 11:49.083
Sue, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.875
I'm just saying,
this is another example

11:50.875 --> 11:53.000
of Lee Russell using
very poor judgment.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.083
What do you expect
from ol' King Ding-a Ling?

11:55.083 --> 11:57.500
(laughter)

11:57.500 --> 11:59.000
That cartoon
was pretty awesome.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.792
Mm-hmm.
I'd love to shake the hand
of whoever did that.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.792
I made it my wallpaper.
(laughs)

12:03.792 --> 12:06.834
That's fantastic!
She made it her wallpaper!

12:06.834 --> 12:08.583
(laughs)

12:09.917 --> 12:11.208
Classic cartoon cutdown.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.917
Sure would love
to know who did it.
Did you do it?

12:13.917 --> 12:16.959
Amanda, did you hear
from the publisher
about your book yet?

12:16.959 --> 12:18.041
No, not yet.
Oh.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.125
Fingers crossed.
Yeah.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.750
Publisher? What are
you guys talking about?

12:20.750 --> 12:23.458
Wait--
Amanda's boyfriend has
connections at Penguin Press,

12:23.458 --> 12:24.959
and he's trying to help
her get published.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.542
Yup. That's right.
Thanks, Jen.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.542
Yeah, sure.
Well, if that's all
you're looking for,

12:28.542 --> 12:30.125
you should have
told me ages go.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.875
I have several
esteemed colleagues

12:31.875 --> 12:33.834
who dominate
in that field

12:33.834 --> 12:35.542
of business stuff.
Oh.

12:35.542 --> 12:38.166
I had no idea,
but I guess Brian was

12:38.166 --> 12:39.667
just the first to
believe in my work, so...

12:39.667 --> 12:41.458
Yeah, I bet he believes
in your work all right.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.917
Tell me, uh,
did you, uh,

12:42.917 --> 12:44.166
ever even read my book?

12:44.166 --> 12:46.750
I'm reading it right now.
Yeah, where are you?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.125
I'm at the part
where all the,

12:48.125 --> 12:50.667
the... stuff is going on
to the main character.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.875
What, page one?
Ms. Snodgrass,
I think you just need

12:52.875 --> 12:54.333
to keep your feet
on the ground, okay?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.583
I mean, I'm sure this Brian
is gonna promise you the world

12:56.583 --> 12:58.834
if he thinks he can
unzip your blouse

12:58.834 --> 13:00.667
and slip and slide
his privates all over your lips.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.667
Snodgrass: Whoa, Neal.
I'm sorry, Sue.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.375
You do not know
what you are talking about.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.500
But if I am lucky enough
to get my book published,

13:06.500 --> 13:08.250
I'll be sure to sign
a copy for you.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.709
Well, that's not gonna happen,
so don't worry about it.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.458
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

13:12.458 --> 13:13.667
Thanks a lot, Neal.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.417
No, I don't mean--
No, I understood.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.875
Thank you. I got it...
No, I mean he's not gonna
be able to get it published.

13:17.875 --> 13:18.959
Not that--
Oh!

13:18.959 --> 13:22.208
Oh! Oh, my God,
she got fuckin' faced!

13:22.208 --> 13:23.542
I wasn't trying
to face her.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.542
I was just trying
to give her some advice.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.500
(car screeches)

13:39.917 --> 13:41.041
Oh, fuck!

13:42.583 --> 13:43.542
Shit.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.000
(grunts)
Goddammit!

13:46.000 --> 13:47.542
Goddammit!
What the hell?

13:47.542 --> 13:48.875
Bill, what the fuck
are you doing?

13:48.875 --> 13:50.041
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:50.041 --> 13:51.709
That was a classic
comedy cutoff.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.500
I pulled in front of you,
you were gonna slow down,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.917
swerve out of the way,
we'd get out and both
laugh about it!

13:56.834 --> 13:58.583
What?
Look, can I ask you a favor?

13:58.583 --> 14:01.667
Do you have any
of your old lesson plans
for the, uh, Reconstruction era?

14:01.667 --> 14:02.834
Go fuck yourself.

14:02.834 --> 14:05.458
Bill, please, be professional
for a moment here, okay?

14:05.458 --> 14:08.542
You fired me
and now you want my help?

14:08.542 --> 14:09.542
Fuck you, Neal.

14:09.542 --> 14:10.792
Think about the children, okay?

14:10.792 --> 14:13.083
They are our future, Bill.
Screw the children.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.667
Well, maybe you care about this.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.917
Amanda Snodgrass.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.417
Huh? You might be
interested to know

14:17.417 --> 14:20.333
she's getting pretty cozy
with Mr. Hotshot Porsche.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.458
Brian Biehn?

14:21.458 --> 14:23.166
Brian Biehn?
That's what he's called?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.458
What else do
you know about him?

14:24.458 --> 14:25.583
He's a fucking novelist.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.333
He teaches a writing course
that Amanda took.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.583
So that's his game, huh?

14:28.583 --> 14:30.542
He finds young pupils
to publish and then fuck.

14:30.542 --> 14:33.250
That seems
like a lot of effort
to get a girl in bed.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.250
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.583
He seems pretty pathetic,
if you ask me.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.291
And how about her?
I mean, can you believe this?

14:37.291 --> 14:39.041
She's just got to go
from one guy to the next.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.583
I mean, obviously she has some
major codependency issues.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.667
Hey, you know what, Neal?
I don't want to bond with you.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.125
We're not, like,
friends or anything.
Uh, yeah. No duh.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.583
I'm not trying
to bond with you.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.333
I'm not trying to be friends.
I know we're not friends.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.709
Don't fucking
come around here anymore.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.417
Bill, if you need a job rec,
let me know, okay?

14:52.417 --> 14:54.083
Because I'm not petty.
I will give you that.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.542
Only thing I need
from you, Neal, is for
you to go fuck yourself.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.667
So, why don't you do that?
That would be a big favor to me.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.208
Thank you for
the information
on Brian.

15:00.208 --> 15:03.000
I appreciate it.
Good luck.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.959
Woman (on TV):
I insist that every room
be searched.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.000
Girl: Daddy?
Man: Sara.

15:08.959 --> 15:11.792
Daddy! Oh, Daddy,
it is you!

15:11.792 --> 15:13.959
I found you,
I found you!

15:13.959 --> 15:16.458
They said you were dead,
but I knew you weren't!

15:16.458 --> 15:18.000
I knew you'd come back!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.333
Oh, Daddy!

15:19.333 --> 15:21.125
My mom is right here.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.750
Shh. She's sleeping.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.500
It is big, isn't it?
Why are you asking me?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.542
Well, you're the one
I stick it in, Christine.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.083
Who else am I gonna ask?

15:30.083 --> 15:31.709
Yeah, it's fine.
I mean, I don't know.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.834
I haven't seen
a lot of penises.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.959
Well, certainly
you know if it's...

15:35.959 --> 15:37.583
if it's small.

15:37.583 --> 15:38.834
It's perfect for me.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.959
Big ones hurt.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.667
Well, I could hurt you.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.583
I could hit both walls
if I wanted, and your uterus.

15:46.583 --> 15:47.709
Just get away from me.

15:47.709 --> 15:50.792
Lee!
No, I'm going to bed.

15:50.792 --> 15:53.166
(gasps)
Turn the television off
and go to bed.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.250
That's enough TV for you.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.792
(Sara cries)
Father: Must you cry?

15:56.792 --> 16:00.041
Gamby:
I don't understand why
you guys bought all this stuff.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.709
The room was already set up.

16:01.709 --> 16:04.041
You don't even have
curtains that work.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.375
Gale, what do
I need curtains for?

16:05.375 --> 16:06.583
I don't even have neighbors.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.709
You know what, Janelle?
I like this place for you.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.834
Thank you, Ray.
I appreciate you
being supportive.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.792
I don't know why she can't
just drop the child off

16:12.792 --> 16:14.041
and keep her stupid mouth shut.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.500
I don't understand
why you decided

16:15.500 --> 16:16.917
to move to a fucking
pioneer house

16:16.917 --> 16:18.375
30 miles in the middle
of Bumfuck.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.959
I'm living in
a secluded place, Gale,

16:19.959 --> 16:21.208
for our daughter's safety.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.542
What if I were staying in town
or staying at your place

16:23.542 --> 16:25.125
and the murderer
tracked me down there?
Don't--

16:25.125 --> 16:27.000
He'd blast you
in your f-ing face,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.166
kill her, and maybe
even kill Ray.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.542
He's gonna murder me?
No one's gonna murder you, baby.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.041
You're off the grid now,
that's for sure.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.250
You'll be safe out here.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.709
Safety is just an illusion, Ray.

16:35.709 --> 16:38.375
All it takes is one nutball
with a high-powered rifle

16:38.375 --> 16:40.709
to shatter that illusion
to a fine, pink mist.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.709
Well, maybe more of a reason
to get curtains that work.

16:42.709 --> 16:45.083
That's all.
Do you always have
to be so negative?

16:45.083 --> 16:46.458
I'm not negative. I'm--
Ray: Neal,

16:46.458 --> 16:48.125
take me and show me
around outside.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.834
Let the girls get
the room all set up.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.041
Why is everyone acting
like the room is not set up?
The room has been set up.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.583
And they threw
the barn in with it.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.417
As you can see, security is
a very big deal to me,

16:59.417 --> 17:04.208
so I've been turning this barn
into my command central station.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.083
Ray:
Kind of paranoid, bud.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.000
Isn't this a little
over the top?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.875
Ray, my shooter's
still at-large.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.083
I'm not gonna rest
until I catch this fucker.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.500
Who are you looking up?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.750
Brian Biehn.
Globetrotting author

17:18.750 --> 17:20.750
and professor
of English studies.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.125
(inhales)

17:22.125 --> 17:24.291
What's he with, a gang?
No, looks like
it's a photograph

17:24.291 --> 17:25.959
from his first novel,
Sky's the Limit.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.834
"Firsthand account
of a hard life

17:27.834 --> 17:29.458
from child soldiers
in Uganda."

17:29.458 --> 17:30.625
Damn.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.333
Looks like it was
also a Critic's Pick.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.542
Gamby:
Hm.

17:33.542 --> 17:34.959
What's he doing
in that picture?

17:34.959 --> 17:37.333
Gamby: This is
from his second novel,
The Ripest Fruit.

17:37.333 --> 17:41.375
"Brian Biehn embeds himself
with an Indonesian tribe
of cannibals."

17:41.375 --> 17:43.083
Ray:
This guy's for real.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.792
Looks like Brian Biehn
might be my number one suspect

17:45.792 --> 17:47.500
on my shooter's list.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.917
He's got the motive.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.458
He's dating Amanda Snodgrass.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.458
Chick you took to motocross?

17:52.458 --> 17:53.959
This guy Brian
stole her from you?

17:53.959 --> 17:55.834
No. I dumped her.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.125
Stopped returning
her phone calls,

17:57.125 --> 17:58.834
just kind of, like,
let the relationship fizzle.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.083
Why'd you do that?
She was awesome.
I was shot, Ray.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.834
Okay, I wasn't,
like, thinking clearly.
I made some mistakes.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.125
So, it's not Brian's fault.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.166
Oh, my God.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.333
You are so dense sometimes.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.792
Listen, he tried
to kill me, all right?

18:09.792 --> 18:13.542
He's hanging out
with machine guns
and cannibals.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.375
Maybe this is one
you let go.

18:15.375 --> 18:19.208
Funny thing about me, Ray,
when push comes to shove,

18:19.208 --> 18:20.709
I can eat people too.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.875
(chortles)

18:22.875 --> 18:24.208
It's not a joke, Ray.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.333
I could eat a person
if I needed to.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.959
(school bell chimes)

18:32.166 --> 18:33.333
(Gamby scoffs)

18:35.000 --> 18:36.583
Ooh. What's up, sexy?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.083
Hot glasses.

18:38.083 --> 18:41.417
Having honor students draw
pictures of Frankenstein?

18:41.417 --> 18:43.291
That's so dumb, Neal.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.709
I know it's dumb.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.000
This teacher bullshit.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.208
I'm just putting
a B+ on all of 'em
and calling it a day.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.583
You know,
if you want some help

18:49.583 --> 18:52.041
with all this teaching stuff,
I could come work with you.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.458
I'm on different meds now.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.583
It would be
better this time.

18:59.583 --> 19:00.709
I'm not interested.

19:00.709 --> 19:03.375
I don't want companionship
from anybody right now.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.125
My mind is focused
on more important things.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.667
Give me a break.
Snodgrass?

19:07.667 --> 19:09.542
Milner: Biddy-bop!
What's up, Milner?

19:09.542 --> 19:11.625
Hey.
What's up? (chuckles)

19:11.625 --> 19:14.667
I see maybe two kids here
who could be artists.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.083
The rest are shit.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.417
What the hell
do you know?

19:17.417 --> 19:18.709
You're a science
teacher, Milner.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.166
I know art
when I see it.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.583
Like King Ding-a Ling.
In fact, everybody,
have you heard?

19:22.583 --> 19:24.041
There's a new one
of Russell out.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.709
There's a new drawing?
On the bulletin board.

19:25.709 --> 19:27.750
Wah-ha!
(laughs)

19:32.458 --> 19:34.333
Gamby:
"Racing to a stop"?

19:34.333 --> 19:36.166
Seychelles:
Is he smiling
or is he scared?

19:36.166 --> 19:37.792
Huh.
Deets: Does Lee even
ride a bike?

19:37.792 --> 19:39.250
I don't think
I've ever seen him on one.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.583
This is not as good
as King Ding-a Ling, but...

19:41.583 --> 19:43.375
Deets:
I'm not quite sure
what he's trying to say.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.291
Seychelles:
When did this go up?
It must just have

19:45.291 --> 19:48.125
because it wasn't
there a minute ago.
Well, I just noticed it.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.625
But you're right.
Not as good as the last one.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.083
Oh, it's disappointing.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.375
(sighs)

19:55.667 --> 19:57.125
What's up, Deep Throat?

19:57.125 --> 19:58.917
Feel like a teacher yet?

19:58.917 --> 20:00.875
Oh, fuck you.
Don't call me that.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.125
So what's the word?
You hear any good shit?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.500
Well, the teachers
definitely hate you.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.083
They mock you
at every turn.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.417
No shit.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.500
Give me somethin'
I can use.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.125
Who drew the cartoon?

20:15.125 --> 20:17.667
I got a theory.
Was it Mrs. Deets?

20:17.667 --> 20:18.959
No, not Deets.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.792
Milner. Science teacher.

20:20.792 --> 20:23.125
He revealed a second drawing
in the teachers' lounge.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.375
A-- a second drawing?

20:24.375 --> 20:25.792
Don't worry,
it wasn't any good.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.291
It was you buck naked
on a bicycle

20:28.291 --> 20:30.959
with your tiny pecker
barely poking out
of your pubic hairs.

20:30.959 --> 20:32.417
It was like
"Racing to a stop."

20:32.417 --> 20:34.959
I don't know what the fuck
he was trying to say,
but it failed.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.792
It's like he expected it to be
an uproarious sequel,

20:36.792 --> 20:38.834
but it scored no laughs.
Fuckin' Milner.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.875
I thought he was
a decent Christian man.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.875
Too bad I can't destroy
a handicap the way I would
a normal person.

20:43.875 --> 20:44.834
(sighs)

20:44.834 --> 20:48.458
Well, good job, Gamby.

20:48.458 --> 20:52.333
Now would you please
just do me one more favor?

20:52.333 --> 20:57.125
Would you stop wearing
this old Warriors' shit?

20:57.125 --> 21:00.750
Russell, I don't understand
what the big deal is.
It's time, Gamby.

21:00.750 --> 21:04.000
I can't have my VP living
in the past

21:04.000 --> 21:05.542
while everybody else
moves forward.

21:05.542 --> 21:08.000
I'm not gonna ask you again.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.291
So, is that the end
of the meeting?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.667
(sighs)
This is the end, Gamby.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.291
Leave your jacket.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.583
Why do I have to be
here for this?
Because, Janelle,

21:28.583 --> 21:30.750
if Brian Biehn happens
to neutralize me,

21:30.750 --> 21:33.250
you're gonna have to fend
for your life.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.375
Clear!

21:35.542 --> 21:36.709
(Gamby chuckles)

21:36.709 --> 21:38.667
One false step, sayonara.

21:38.667 --> 21:41.375
Don't roll your eyes.
What's gotten into you?

21:41.375 --> 21:42.792
I don't like
coming way out here.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.208
It's too far
from all my friends.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.583
(scoffs) Well, you're
gonna be pretty far
from your friends

21:46.583 --> 21:48.875
when you're in heaven,
dead from being shot.

21:48.875 --> 21:53.041
Clear. Brian Biehn.
Destroyed him.

21:53.041 --> 21:55.041
Gotta beat him.
You see, you identify,

21:55.041 --> 21:57.375
you get behind him,
up his asshole like that.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.709
Wonderful to see you,
Mr. Biehn.

21:58.709 --> 22:01.166
I call this little
shit-thrower the Apocalypto.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.834
Stuck like a fucking pig.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.625
Stab his privates.
There you go.

22:07.625 --> 22:08.750
Trespass me?

22:08.750 --> 22:11.375
Fuck you, Brian Biehn.

22:11.375 --> 22:15.417
Why don't you
write your way out
of this trap, book fuck?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.625
(snapping)

22:18.583 --> 22:20.250
Safety above all else.

22:21.291 --> 22:22.542
Biehn:
Ibsen said

22:22.542 --> 22:25.166
that there are
two kinds of conscience.

22:25.166 --> 22:27.250
One in a man,

22:27.250 --> 22:32.041
and the other, in
an altogether different way,

22:32.041 --> 22:34.917
in a woman.

22:34.917 --> 22:36.333
Very insightful.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.125
So we will pick
this up next week.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.834
Thank you all for your rapt
devotion and attention

22:41.834 --> 22:43.917
to Henrik Ibsen.

22:44.959 --> 22:46.709
I have a couple
of ideas for you two.

22:46.709 --> 22:50.333
What if you two
dramatize act three?

22:50.333 --> 22:51.750
Let's get together
tomorrow night

22:51.750 --> 22:53.083
and we can rehearse
a little bit.

22:53.083 --> 22:56.667
Fascinating lesson,
Mr. Professor Biehn.
Thank you.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.333
Um, I'll see
you later, all right?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.125
I haven't seen you
in, uh, my class before.

23:01.125 --> 23:02.625
Uh, is there something
I can do for you?

23:02.625 --> 23:04.792
Detective Bernard Willows
from the, uh,

23:04.792 --> 23:07.500
Downtown Police
Precinct offices.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.500
What's this all about?
(chuckles)

23:10.500 --> 23:12.542
How 'bout I ask
the questions today, okay?

23:12.542 --> 23:13.917
Did I do something
wrong, Officer?

23:13.917 --> 23:16.792
"Detective." And that's
what I'm here to find out.

23:16.792 --> 23:19.333
When was the last time you were
at North Jackson High School?

23:19.333 --> 23:20.792
Today.

23:20.792 --> 23:23.792
I dropped off a friend,
Amanda Snodgrass.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.417
She's a teacher there.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.041
And are you...

23:27.041 --> 23:28.792
girlfriends and boyfriends
with this teacher?

23:28.792 --> 23:31.000
I don't like to use
the term "girlfriend,"

23:31.000 --> 23:33.625
but we, uh,
we are dating, yes.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.792
Have you made intercourse
with this woman?

23:35.792 --> 23:37.291
Excuse me?
Coitus.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.500
Flesh-to-flesh.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.959
What did you say
your name was?

23:39.959 --> 23:42.375
Detective Bernard Willows.
You want to see my badge again?

23:42.375 --> 23:44.333
How about
my fucking gun, huh?

23:44.333 --> 23:45.834
Is Amanda in
some kind of trouble?

23:45.834 --> 23:47.250
No. You are.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.750
And you do not want
to get on my bad side,
do you hear?

23:49.750 --> 23:52.000
What?
Do you own a gun,
Professor?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.250
A nine millimeter?

23:53.250 --> 23:54.750
No, I do not own a gun.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.250
Have you ever taken a gun
and shot someone

23:57.250 --> 23:59.583
in the hip and in
the motherfucking shoulder?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.333
No! I hate guns.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.458
I know what guns
can do to people.

24:03.458 --> 24:06.375
I'm trying to assess
whether you're being
truthful or not.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.041
I would feel
a lot more comfortable

24:08.041 --> 24:09.500
if I had a lawyer present.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.834
We're not calling
any fucking lawyers,
do you understand me?

24:11.834 --> 24:13.583
I will cooperate.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.709
What can I do?
I'll tell you
what you can do.

24:15.709 --> 24:18.000
You can stay the hell away
from Amanda Snodgrass.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.625
There is nothing
but trouble for you there.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.709
I'm helping Amanda
with her novel.

24:21.709 --> 24:22.834
Pathetic.

24:22.834 --> 24:25.000
You better stay off
my fucking bad side.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.917
I understand.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.125
Good.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.125
And I appreciate
your cooperation, citizen.

24:31.125 --> 24:35.208
It's time to go do
the other mysteries
that I have to work on.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.750
Good day.

24:43.542 --> 24:44.792
(sighs)

24:44.792 --> 24:46.083
(mutters) Fuck no.

24:46.083 --> 24:47.500
(mutters indistinctly)

24:48.709 --> 24:50.709
Let's do it.
Let's just do it.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.875
What?

25:03.875 --> 25:05.500
Uh, okay.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.375
Okay, this is cool.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.166
(clears throat)

25:09.166 --> 25:11.750
Baby? Guess what? I--

25:14.000 --> 25:15.250
What?

25:21.583 --> 25:22.750
Oh, gross.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.792
Hey! Did you go
to the college

25:26.792 --> 25:28.291
and pretend to be
a cop to Brian?

25:28.291 --> 25:29.709
Where did you hear
something like that?

25:29.709 --> 25:32.166
From Brian. He told me
a cop named Willows came by

25:32.166 --> 25:34.417
asking about me.
It wasn't hard to figure out.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.208
Okay, fine.
You got me. Yeah.

25:36.208 --> 25:39.250
I went over there to go
inspect that son of a bitch
to see what he was up to.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.500
Are you out of your mind?

25:40.500 --> 25:41.875
You pulled a gun
on him, Neal.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.917
Okay, if he's telling you that,
then he's telling a big lie

25:43.917 --> 25:45.333
'cause I did not do that.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.125
And all of this crazy shit,
'cause you're jealous now?

25:47.125 --> 25:48.375
Come on.
Don't get a big head.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.041
No, I went over there
because, yes,

25:50.041 --> 25:51.834
I did suspect him
as being my shooter.

25:51.834 --> 25:54.583
So, I wanted to check up on him,
not because I'm jealous,

25:54.583 --> 25:56.583
but my assumptions were
correct about him.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.792
He doesn't have the contacts
it takes to get you published.

25:58.792 --> 26:00.083
He's just trying
to fuck you.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.291
Well, the Penguin Press
are flying me to New York

26:02.291 --> 26:03.458
for a meeting,
so you're wrong.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.458
You got the meeting?
Yes, I did.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.959
Yup.

26:06.959 --> 26:08.417
Congrats.
Thank you.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.792
But I'm sure he's
just setting the meeting
so he can fuck you.

26:10.792 --> 26:11.834
Stop it.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.500
If you care so much
about who I'm dating,

26:13.500 --> 26:16.333
then you tell me why
you stopped talking to me
after the shooting.

26:18.625 --> 26:21.709
You think that you know me,
okay, but you don't.

26:21.709 --> 26:24.458
I've done some
really terrible things.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.500
Some really bad stuff.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.000
And I was just trying
to protect you.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.500
Oh, my God, Neal.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.667
You know what?

26:33.667 --> 26:35.000
You don't even
need to bother.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.500
I'm a big girl.
I've been dumped before.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.959
You don't have to squeeze out
