WEBVTT

00:50.520 --> 00:52.431
I think my period's coming.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.839
DOORBELL RINGS

00:58.240 --> 01:00.550
OK...

01:00.600 --> 01:01.476
Hi!

01:01.520 --> 01:03.670
Are you all right?
What's happened? Are you hurt?

01:03.720 --> 01:05.916
- Oh, good.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.999
Nice haircut.
- It's better.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.715
Can I come in?

01:13.760 --> 01:15.478
Why didn't you text?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.079
Well, I just thought I'd pop by.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.030
Tell the truth.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.229
I need to speak to Martin.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.111
Martin?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.594
Martin. Martin.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.280
Why on earth would you
want to speak to...

01:23.331 --> 01:24.651
CLAIRE: Martin?
- Hello!

01:24.691 --> 01:27.989
Hello! My wife in my study, hello.
Give me two.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.554
Gangbangs, Asian.
I'd put a tenner on it.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.593
MARTIN SIGHS
- Finished.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.157
Well, hello, you.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.237
MARTIN LAUGHS

01:37.280 --> 01:38.953
She wants to talk to you
about something.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.798
Oh, well, must be my lucky day.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.354
You said she only likes
to talk to people she fancies.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.913
THEY LAUGH

01:44.960 --> 01:45.756
Ugh.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.871
Can you leave us?
- Why?

01:47.920 --> 01:50.434
He's organizing your
surprise birthday party.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.549
Er... you know, I hate surp... OK.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.390
I have a week to organise that now.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.475
Best of luck.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.669
Nice top.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.358
Ugh. Thanks.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.676
Do you deal in sculptures as well as
paintings and papier-méché?

02:09.720 --> 02:12.030
Depends on the quality of the piece.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.752
Fuck me.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.354
MARTIN:
What a pair!

02:21.400 --> 02:22.720
MARTIN LAUGHS
- I know, right?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.279
Where'd you get this?

02:25.320 --> 02:29.359
Oh, just a...
stole it from a market.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.233
Oh. It's quite a piece.
Who's the artist?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.153
Just <i>a...</i> market artist.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
Huh.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.559
If I sell it, I take ten percent. Deal?

02:40.600 --> 02:41.749
Deal.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.918
OK. Well, I'll get her
photographed now.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.634
Don't tell Claire, please.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.909
Or what?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.236
Or I'll... I'II...
- MARTIN LAUGHS

02:51.280 --> 02:53.669
You got nothing on me, princess.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.154
SHE LAUGHS

02:55.200 --> 02:57.396
Or I'll tell her you were
watching gangbangs.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.032
Please don't do that again.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.838
I wasn't, by the way.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.355
Ugh.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.919
Disappointing.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.112
Erm... Where did you get that?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.639
Oh, I brought it with me.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.432
No, you didn't. Give it back.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.679
Tight.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.358
Patch things up with Harry?

03:37.400 --> 03:40.438
Yeah. We're... engaged, so.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.879
God! What?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.593
No, we're not engaged.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.075
No, he's back at the flat,
packing up all his stuff again.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.552
Oh. I'm sorry.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.755
He really used to make you laugh.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.677
He also used to say things like...

03:54.720 --> 03:56.552
You're not like other girls.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.750
You can... keep up.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.949
HE SLURPS

04:00.760 --> 04:03.752
I like Harry. I liked his songs.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.988
I admire how much Harry
commits to our breakups.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.033
I mean, this is a new detail.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.832
But he does usually go the extra mile.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.474
A few times, he's even
cleaned the whole flat.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.519
HARRY SOBS

04:29.560 --> 04:31.710
Oh God, no.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.752
Like it's a crime scene.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.589
I've considered timing a breakup for when
the flat needs a bit of a going over.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.276
I don't think this is working.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.435
What?

04:52.360 --> 04:55.512
But he always leaves...

05:00.480 --> 05:01.754
him.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.359
To come back for.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.233
Got to think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.396
I'm not obsessed with sex.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.716
I just can't stop thinking about it.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.078
The performance of it

05:15.120 --> 05:17.157
the awkwardness of it

05:17.200 --> 05:19.111
the drama of it.

05:19.480 --> 05:24.714
The moment you realise
someone wants your body.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.917
Not so much the feeling of it.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.038
Probably got about 48 hours
before Harry comes back.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.312
I should get on it.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.470
I took half an hour trying to look nice

05:40.520 --> 05:42.955
and I ended up looking amazing!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.399
Just one of those days.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.114
Gorgeous, fresh-faced,
new top, little bit sexy

05:47.160 --> 05:48.912
on my way to open my café.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.951
And... Oh God.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.150
Yeah, you check me out, chub-chub,
'cause it's never going to happen.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.599
Oh God, he can't believe
how attractive I am.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.360
Kind of worried I'm going to make
a sex offender out of the poor guy.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.356
Here we go.
This better be good. Here we go.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.152
MAN COUGHS
- Walk of shame!

06:06.960 --> 06:08.120
BIKE BELL RINGS
- CYCLIST: Oi!

06:22.040 --> 06:23.917
Oh.
- SHE LAUGHS

06:23.960 --> 06:25.394
Dropped my cucumber.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.070
Just dropped my...

06:37.120 --> 06:39.919
Um... Could I get a
cheese sandwich to go, please?

06:39.960 --> 06:41.189
Sure.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.714
That'll be, um... £12.55, please.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.230
London.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.476
SHE LAUGHS
- Thanks.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.233
Why do I recognise her?
Is she famous?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.312
Boo's death hit the papers.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.194
Local café girl gets hit by bike,
and a car, and another bike.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.599
Oh no, she used to work here.
- Oh.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.838
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.678
MAN SIGHS

07:28.280 --> 07:31.352
The next man who walks in here
is getting ridden to death.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.635
,_

07:34.680 --> 07:35.795
Hi.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.714
Not ideal.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.833
Um... How are you? Darling?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.355
You busy?

07:44.880 --> 07:45.950
A bit.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.798
Well, I won't keep you.

07:48.960 --> 07:53.716
I just wanted to talk about
when you dropped in the other night.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.194
OK.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.517
I can't help thinking that I... we...

07:58.560 --> 08:00.358
Yeah?
- I know that we...

08:02.080 --> 08:04.549
don't have much
of a chance to...

08:05.760 --> 08:08.957
Did you take the sculpture?
Did you um...

08:09.960 --> 08:13.032
take the sculpture?
Did you take it?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.637
No. What sculpture?

08:17.680 --> 08:20.035
Oh right. Right. Good.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.389
Good. You said, "No," and that...

08:24.080 --> 08:27.755
that means I can go.
All right, great.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.595
Phew.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.236
Are you happy? Are you healthy?

08:33.736 --> 08:34.736
DAD:
Hmm.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.912
GIRLS CHATTER

08:37.960 --> 08:40.712
Hey. Do you do, like,
hot organic-y food?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.433
Of course.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.151
What would you like?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.793
Um, I like risotto.
- Yeah.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.592
Sure. Grab a seat.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.560
Hey.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.235
Hi.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.280
Hey.

09:14.576 --> 09:15.576
Hey.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.954
It's nice to see you.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.274
You too.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.073
Fucked me up the arse.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.440
What are you getting?

09:22.040 --> 09:23.189
Oh, just these.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.993
For my tiny, bleeding vagina.

09:27.056 --> 09:28.056
Hot.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.797
You?

09:28.840 --> 09:29.875
Stock cubes.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.194
Hot.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.558
Hope it's a light flow.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.670
Oh.
- SHE LAUGHS

09:34.720 --> 09:36.233
It never is.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.315
It never... is.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.719
Listen, you around later?

09:44.720 --> 09:45.755
Er...

09:45.800 --> 09:47.120
Yes, fucking yes please, yes.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.514
Yes.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.595
Cool.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.677
Cool. Bye.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.634
Yes!

09:58.680 --> 10:01.320
YOGA GIRL 1:
I'm so happy with my body now.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.269
Like, I don't have to define
myself by how I look

10:04.320 --> 10:06.152
'cause I've just got
a fucking great body!

10:06.200 --> 10:06.996
YOGA GIRL 2:
Yeah.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.856
YOGA GIRL 1:
Yeah! I can like, do other stuff now.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.836
YOGA GIRL 2:
That's so great!

10:09.880 --> 10:11.917
YOGA GIRL 1:
Mike wants to start trying for a baby.

10:11.960 --> 10:12.756
OK?

10:12.800 --> 10:16.156
No... I can't blow this body
on a baby, Steph.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.396
I'm going to have to leave him.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.874
SHE LAUGHS

10:19.920 --> 10:21.240
What the fuck?

10:21.960 --> 10:23.951
FLEABAG:
Oh, shit.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.320
YOGA GIRL 1:
That is not hygienic.

10:25.344 --> 10:26.520
Sorry.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.995
Oh, gross! We're leaving now.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.438
I suppose you should meet Hilary.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.914
Two years ago, I...

10:34.800 --> 10:36.234
OK, the most important thing is

10:36.280 --> 10:38.160
if you don't like it,
we can't take it back, OK?

10:38.184 --> 10:39.184
OK.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.439
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry, I panicked.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.915
As long as I can wear it
or eat it, I'm happy.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.837
You can do both of those things.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.229
Oh my God! Did you get me a...
What is this?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.509
I...
- SHE LAUGHS

10:51.560 --> 10:53.437
What is...?
- I don't know!

10:53.480 --> 10:55.391
What is it?
- Something to love?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.795
She's beautiful!

10:57.840 --> 10:59.478
THEY LAUGH

10:59.520 --> 11:01.158
Thank you, you idiot.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.077
FLEABAG:
Escape artist.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.993
I don't feel anything about
guinea pigs, they're pointless.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.475
But Boo took Hilary
very seriously as a gift

11:15.520 --> 11:19.195
and soon everything
became guinea pig related.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.593
This is an excellent one.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.035
Drink?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.549
SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

11:33.920 --> 11:36.355
Look, I'm sorry about the mess.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.435
No problem.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.960
Do you want some
prosciutto with that?

11:38.984 --> 11:40.054
Mmm.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.158
He's so reliable.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.079
Utterly inaccessible
and relentlessly profound.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.033
All he wants is to get you in the bath
and ask questions like...

11:56.080 --> 11:57.514
What are you afraid of?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.716
And you find yourself saying things like...

12:01.600 --> 12:04.991
I guess, losing
the currency of youth.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.238
Ask me a question.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.350
When did you realise
you were so good-looking?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.269
I knew I was different
when I was about nine.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.197
But shit got real around 11.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.833
Shit got real?

12:22.880 --> 12:26.191
You know. Aunts got weird.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.912
I have another question.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.273
OK.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.358
Do you ever feel lonely?

12:37.720 --> 12:40.314
Yeah. Of course.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.389
Do you?

12:42.920 --> 12:44.319
Never.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.353
Do you want some pineapple?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.074
Yeah.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.478
God! Yeah!

13:03.520 --> 13:08.640
Oh, they're so small. You are so small!

13:08.680 --> 13:09.750
What?

13:09.800 --> 13:11.120
They're so small.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.230
So...

13:12.280 --> 13:16.353
Small. God, they are so fucking tiny.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.754
Yeah, I guess they're...

13:17.800 --> 13:21.191
God, they're hardly even there!
I mean, what the fuck even are they?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.913
Bit much.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.754
Excuse me.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.634
Oh yeah.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.954
I'm having a Harry panic.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.160
Madame Ovary is telling me
to run back to safe place.

13:36.202 --> 13:37.402
I can make baby in safe place.

13:37.426 --> 13:38.942
But... got to ride it out.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.675
Mustn't... call... Ha...

13:48.840 --> 13:50.672
Thanks for coming.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.834
That's OK.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.474
Are you OK?

13:54.520 --> 13:56.670
Your message sounded urgent.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.235
Were you busy?

14:00.280 --> 14:01.759
No, I was in the interval...

14:01.800 --> 14:02.870
Oh cool.
Of Cats.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.797
OK.
- The musical.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.117
Was it good?
- Really good actually. Really good.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.639
Sorry for interrupting.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.000
No, that's OK.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.271
I got the feeling it wasn't
going to end well for the cats

14:15.320 --> 14:19.314
so, I mean, probably good to remember
them like that, before they all...

14:20.360 --> 14:22.920
Sorry. Are you OK?

14:24.320 --> 14:25.640
Who were you with?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.273
A work friend.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.595
A girl.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.558
Urn...

14:40.480 --> 14:42.198
I found this.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.519
Thanks.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.593
I didn't realise I'd left it.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.359
Why is your hair wet?

15:01.560 --> 15:02.959
Don't look at me like that.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.752
Like what? Like what?

15:04.800 --> 15:08.077
Look, I don't want
to sound cold or cruel or...

15:08.120 --> 15:11.440
and I don't want you to think I'm just off
happy at the theater all the time either.

15:11.464 --> 15:12.395
I'm not.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.432
But... I'm not going to... I just...

15:16.120 --> 15:18.430
If this is about us getting
back together, I was serious.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.596
This time, I'm not just
going to come running back.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.438
I really just need some time away from...

15:25.160 --> 15:27.117
I'm so glad you called.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.992
I'm so glad you picked up.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.798
I've missed you.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.513
I've missed you.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.476
Oh my gosh, you feel good.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.837
I wish he'd just fuck me.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.996
All he wants to do is make love.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.317
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm really good. I'm amazing.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.277
He's wasting me.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.473
I was once fucking this guy
who would breathe on every thrust.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.875
You're so young! You're so young!

15:57.920 --> 16:00.116
I masturbate about that all the time.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.717
Masturbate a lot these days.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.516
Especially when I'm bored.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.272
Or angry.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.629
Or upset.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.034
Can we just...

16:11.080 --> 16:12.559
Or happy.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.559
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.954
Amazing.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.035
Yeah.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.516
Shall I...
- No, could you just... just stay there.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.837
Oh, just don't... Yeah, no, don't. Just...

16:28.240 --> 16:30.038
Yeah, ssh.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.074
Yeah.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.359
Yes, just... oh, just...

16:35.400 --> 16:36.913
Oh God.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.471
SHE MOANS

16:59.440 --> 17:01.351
I think we should stop masturbating.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.718
No, don't say anything yet.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.038
I just think it might help us
focus on each other

17:12.079 --> 17:13.957
you know, be more present.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.195
Really successful couples do it, you know.

17:18.136 --> 17:19.136
Um...

17:19.160 --> 17:20.388
I've hidden our vibrators.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
Our?

17:21.480 --> 17:23.039
I thought it might be fun.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.275
To find them?

17:24.319 --> 17:26.357
No. Just to try and not...

17:26.800 --> 17:28.279
touch ourselves.

17:28.319 --> 17:33.235
To try and save our touches
for each other.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.315
What do you think?

17:34.360 --> 17:36.715
Well, I think you're being really sexy.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.989
Don't!

17:38.040 --> 17:39.838
Ooh, I'm joking!

17:40.280 --> 17:43.750
I never masturbate.
I don't know how.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.036
Yeah, also, I thought we should
try and surprise each other

17:50.080 --> 17:51.195
once every day.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.390
Just a, you know, sweet little something

17:53.440 --> 17:55.158
just to keep it, you know...

17:55.200 --> 17:56.713
Are you getting this out of a book?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.274
I've already planned
your first surprise, so...

18:00.440 --> 18:03.193
don't eat too much before dinner.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.033
See you later.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.839
And I will see you later, too.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.355
FLEABAG:
Oh!

18:24.640 --> 18:25.869
Hi.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.594
Just thought I'd pop by for some lunch.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.914
Bit weird.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.917
Yes. Well.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.678
How are you? Quiet day?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.951
Yeah, I'm fine.
You OK? You look stressed.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.116
Well, I'm successful, so.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.114
Do you have rye bread?

18:46.160 --> 18:49.391
Er, no. But I have some normal bread
you can puke up after.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.234
Great.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.469
What do you want on it?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.669
Oh, just tomatoes is fine.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.159
Just tomatoes?

18:57.200 --> 18:58.952
Just a tomato sandwich?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.150
Yes. There a problem?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.349
No.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.960
Listen, I don't want to know
anything about this surprise party.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.995
But if you could just... have it at mine,
this Friday at 7.30, that'd be great.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.398
I can organise it and act surprised,
but if you could just...

19:16.440 --> 19:18.829
Do you know what?
Why don't I just do it?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.838
I can organise it,
do the food, act surprised

19:21.880 --> 19:23.837
and just... take it off your hands.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.440
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.794
OK. If you want.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.515
Well, I don't want to, but I think it'd be
easier for everyone if I could just...

19:30.560 --> 19:31.630
OK.

19:31.680 --> 19:35.594
I mean, I've done it. It's done.
It's this Friday at 7.30, at mine.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.880
Great.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.712
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need...

19:46.760 --> 19:48.080
I don't need money.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.671
That'll be £25, please.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.429
London.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.080
Thanks.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.640
Can't believe that thing's still alive.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.150
Oh, um... any news on Harry?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.474
Yeah, we're back together.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.477
Oh God. I can't keep up.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.074
Hello?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.479
Harry?

20:24.680 --> 20:27.593
Oh... Shit!

20:28.040 --> 20:30.475
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

21:21.080 --> 21:23.276
Surprise!
- HARRY SCREAMS

21:25.000 --> 21:26.559
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

21:26.600 --> 21:28.910
Why would you do that?
I thought I was going to get raped!

21:28.960 --> 21:31.110
I'm sorry! I just...
Baby, I'm sorry.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.400
I thought you wanted a surprise.
It was a ninja surprise.

21:33.424 --> 21:35.589
Oh my God, my heart.
I'm shaking so much. Oh my God.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.995
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

21:38.080 --> 21:39.514
Oh my God!

21:39.560 --> 21:41.073
Oh...
- Oh my God.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.236
OK. It's OK. Are you OK?

21:43.280 --> 21:44.839
Oh my God.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.120
Did you have a good day?
- I did, yeah. It was fine, thanks.

21:48.144 --> 21:50.879
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't think...

21:50.920 --> 21:53.639
I didn't think you were
going to react like that. I...

21:54.320 --> 21:55.469
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.593
It was a good joke.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.149
Jesus.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.157
I thought you'd be later.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.634
Yeah, I...
- HARRY SCREAMS

22:04.680 --> 22:05.875
Oh my God!

22:05.920 --> 22:08.355
Oh, God, sorry, Ijust...
I think I'm still in shock.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.079
That was horrible.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.633
It was a surprise.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.752
I know. Thank you. It's fine.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.958
Shall I go and get us some wine?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.235
OK.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.920
I know what you look like!
I know what you took!

22:34.960 --> 22:36.837
That is the last time!

22:39.400 --> 22:41.869
Splashed out on a
special bottle for a special...

22:45.440 --> 22:46.555
Harry?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.399
Had to go into the history
on my computer

22:50.440 --> 22:53.831
to find something I'd seen on the
H&M website this morning, and...

22:55.560 --> 22:58.279
I don't want to point fingers, but...

22:58.320 --> 23:03.633
anal, gangbang, mature,
big cock, small tits

23:03.680 --> 23:09.517
hentai, Asian, teen, MILF,
big butts, lesbian, gay

23:09.560 --> 23:12.791
facial, fetish, bukakke, young and old

23:12.840 --> 23:17.073
swallow, rough, voyeur, and public.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.636
Why are you being so sexy?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.871
Don't make me hate you.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.591
Loving you is painful enough.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.553
OK, sorry.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.150
But I really think you should
write that down.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.496
I know it's not appropriate, but I really
think you should write that down.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.920
It's really good for a line.
- I'm not going to write down...

23:43.969 --> 23:45.769
No, no, I'm serious!
For your songs and stuff.

23:45.793 --> 23:48.660
It's perfect.
It's poetic, yet real. Serious.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.433
Don't make me...

24:02.480 --> 24:04.710
Hate you.
- Yeah, I know! Thank you!

24:06.240 --> 24:08.993
Loving you is painful...

24:11.280 --> 24:13.032
What am I doing?

24:14.280 --> 24:16.920
There's someone at work who loves me.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.560
Well, she told me she loves me,
and I said we couldn't be together

24:19.584 --> 24:21.461
because I had to know.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.313
Do you want to be alone?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.113
You will never see me again.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.431
I'll always love you,
but I just can't take it anymore.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.032
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.038
He's going to write that down.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.792
I don't hate you... scared.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.875
I'm going to go pack my things up
from the bedroom again. But...

25:05.840 --> 25:07.672
I'm not going to clean.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.109
It's still in pretty good shape, so.

25:12.160 --> 25:15.596
If I don't see you after that, goodbye.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
Forever.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.954
He'll be back.
