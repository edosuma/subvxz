WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.534
My name is

00:05.567 --> 00:06.802
Shake-Zula

00:06.835 --> 00:07.702
The Mic Ruler

00:07.735 --> 00:08.669
The Old-Schooler

00:08.703 --> 00:09.603
you want to trip?

00:09.636 --> 00:10.904
I'll bring it to you.

00:10.937 --> 00:12.671
Frylock, and I'm on top

00:12.705 --> 00:13.939
rock you like a cop

00:13.972 --> 00:15.207
Meatwad, you're up next

00:15.240 --> 00:17.041
with your knock-knock.

00:17.074 --> 00:19.175
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:19.209 --> 00:21.744
Meatwad get the honeys, g.

00:21.777 --> 00:23.011
Drivin' in my car

00:23.044 --> 00:24.278
livin' like a star

00:24.312 --> 00:26.279
ice on my fingers and my toes

00:26.313 --> 00:27.714
and I'm a Taurus.

00:27.747 --> 00:29.381
Check-check it

00:29.415 --> 00:30.316
yeah.

00:30.349 --> 00:32.450
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:32.482 --> 00:33.751
make the homeys say, "ho!"

00:33.784 --> 00:35.619
And the girlies want to scream.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.786
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:37.820 --> 00:39.221
make the homeys say, "ho!"

00:39.254 --> 00:41.488
And the girlies want to scream Ã¢?S

00:41.522 --> 00:43.657
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.358
Number One in the hood, g.

00:53.863 --> 00:54.496
Come on.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.164
Keep going.

00:58.799 --> 01:00.600
This ain't nearly enough.

01:00.634 --> 01:04.108
You need to pick up the pace.

01:04.141 --> 01:05.176
I can't sit around all day

01:05.209 --> 01:06.010
waiting for you to make

01:06.043 --> 01:06.910
enough of this.

01:06.944 --> 01:08.178
How much snot is this gonna

01:08.211 --> 01:08.979
take?

01:09.012 --> 01:10.079
It really all depends on how

01:10.112 --> 01:11.013
tall you want to make your

01:11.046 --> 01:12.414
Mucus Man.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.115
I do want him tall.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.282
Then keep on hocking,

01:15.316 --> 01:16.083
brother.

01:17.084 --> 01:17.917
I'm seeing a lot of blood

01:17.950 --> 01:18.951
now.

01:18.985 --> 01:20.486
Do we need to take 5?

01:20.519 --> 01:21.486
I'm cleaned out.

01:21.519 --> 01:23.320
My snot's on empty, man.

01:23.353 --> 01:24.254
Here.

01:24.288 --> 01:25.188
Have one of these assortment of

01:25.221 --> 01:27.456
cheeses: Gouda, Cheddar,

01:27.490 --> 01:28.256
Provolone...

01:28.290 --> 01:29.124
No, no, no.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.191
This is not working.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.426
I need to be sick!

01:32.459 --> 01:33.760
Tick that doorknob.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.160
and lick it I shall.

01:39.763 --> 01:40.498
What the hell are y'all

01:40.531 --> 01:41.298
doing?

01:41.331 --> 01:42.599
We're making us a Mucus Man.

01:42.632 --> 01:43.432
Don't do that.

01:43.465 --> 01:44.933
You don't have all the tools.

01:44.966 --> 01:46.101
You need to something to heat

01:46.134 --> 01:48.435
the mucus so you can shape it.

01:48.468 --> 01:49.869
Don't tell me how to do it.

01:51.037 --> 01:51.870
Listen.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.171
Don't tell me how to do it.

01:53.205 --> 01:55.106
You tell him how to do it,

01:55.139 --> 01:57.173
and he'll tell me.

01:57.207 --> 01:58.708
With this grill, you can heat

01:58.741 --> 02:00.409
and sculpt the mucus into any

02:00.442 --> 02:01.676
fun shape.

02:01.710 --> 02:02.851
The only limit is your

02:02.884 --> 02:05.052
imagination.

02:05.085 --> 02:06.653
Hmm.

02:06.686 --> 02:08.253
Is that a George Foreman grill?

02:08.287 --> 02:09.920
Uh, no.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.289
George Washington.

02:11.322 --> 02:12.457
Couldn't afford the real

02:12.490 --> 02:13.190
one, huh?

02:13.223 --> 02:15.258
Oh, and like you can.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.125
Shut--you shut your mouth.

02:17.159 --> 02:18.293
Where does it plug in?

02:18.326 --> 02:19.660
Doesn't have to, see?

02:19.694 --> 02:21.661
It's made of wood.

02:21.695 --> 02:23.263
Wow, wood.

02:23.296 --> 02:24.063
Ok, see?

02:24.097 --> 02:25.697
You have to rub the wooden

02:25.730 --> 02:27.632
grates together to generate the

02:27.666 --> 02:29.267
heat.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.834
You have to do it really fast,

02:30.868 --> 02:33.469
and it takes a long time.

02:33.502 --> 02:35.770
It's environmentally friendly.

02:35.803 --> 02:36.704
Yeah.

02:36.737 --> 02:39.206
Major dick move right there.

02:39.239 --> 02:40.306
Dudes!

02:40.339 --> 02:42.378
Check this out!

02:53.081 --> 02:54.648
Oh, yeah!

02:54.682 --> 02:56.349
We grilling tonight.

02:56.383 --> 02:57.283
Now, here's what's different

02:57.316 --> 02:58.417
about this, my friends.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.218
It uses actual pieces of the

03:00.251 --> 03:01.719
sun, combined with some

03:01.752 --> 03:03.227
radioactive vials from

03:03.260 --> 03:04.260
Chernobyl.

03:04.293 --> 03:05.494
And I know this is interesting

03:05.528 --> 03:07.595
also to the ladies out there.

03:07.629 --> 03:09.431
It uses it to heat burgers,

03:09.464 --> 03:10.331
steaks.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.165
Chicken?

03:11.198 --> 03:12.098
No problem.

03:12.132 --> 03:13.799
And best of all, it's not even

03:13.833 --> 03:15.634
supposed to be inside this

03:15.667 --> 03:16.835
country.

03:16.868 --> 03:17.969
This would incinerate mucus

03:18.002 --> 03:18.802
man, Shake.

03:18.836 --> 03:20.503
Not on extra low.

03:22.538 --> 03:23.505
Just a minute.

03:23.539 --> 03:26.207
Got a--it's got a buildup in the

03:26.241 --> 03:30.943
pit.

03:30.976 --> 03:33.478
Uh, hold on a minute.

03:33.511 --> 03:39.214
It's 'cause it's new.

03:39.248 --> 03:40.682
There she goes.

03:40.715 --> 03:42.216
That's that hum.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.284
Oh, I love that sound.

03:44.317 --> 03:45.152
Hey.

03:45.185 --> 03:45.952
Hey, maybe you ought to turn

03:45.985 --> 03:46.886
that thing down.

03:46.919 --> 03:48.020
Mucus man is melting here.

03:48.054 --> 03:49.655
He's not melting.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.321
He's chillaxing.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.057
If you can't speak the language,

03:53.090 --> 03:55.058
go back to Mexico--

03:55.091 --> 03:56.559
where you were born

03:56.592 --> 03:59.160
and are from.

03:59.193 --> 03:59.961
Ow!

03:59.994 --> 04:00.961
Damn it, Shake.

04:00.994 --> 04:02.202
What is this beam made of?

04:02.235 --> 04:03.603
You're noticing the patented

04:03.636 --> 04:05.137
flavor beam.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.105
This injects your dogs or

04:07.138 --> 04:08.606
whatever your meat of choice

04:08.639 --> 04:10.773
with this zesty, hickory-smoky,

04:10.807 --> 04:12.541
down-home zest.

04:12.574 --> 04:17.543
It's good, see?

04:17.577 --> 04:18.545
You want it more pink in the

04:18.577 --> 04:19.378
middle?

04:19.411 --> 04:20.678
Should've spoke up, 'cause this

04:20.713 --> 04:22.079
will not go backwards.

04:22.113 --> 04:23.114
I'm not eating that.

04:23.147 --> 04:24.815
You can eat this now, or you

04:24.848 --> 04:26.416
can be hungry in a couple days

04:26.449 --> 04:27.650
when we run out of money for

04:27.683 --> 04:28.484
food.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.551
Hey, I'll eat it.

04:29.584 --> 04:30.352
Give it to me.

04:30.385 --> 04:32.453
Carl, what in the hell are

04:32.486 --> 04:34.287
you doing on our property again?

04:34.321 --> 04:35.655
Oh, I just came to see why my

04:35.688 --> 04:37.289
doorknob's covered with snot,

04:37.322 --> 04:38.957
and then I saw you, and I

04:38.990 --> 04:40.058
connected the two.

04:40.091 --> 04:41.058
Hey, Carl.

04:41.091 --> 04:42.526
How do you like your tube steak?

04:42.559 --> 04:43.993
I like to park it in some

04:44.027 --> 04:44.927
whore.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.396
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

04:48.430 --> 04:49.963
Ok, uh, let me--let me see if

04:49.996 --> 04:51.264
I got one of them.

04:51.297 --> 04:52.998
Ahh, you set me up on that.

04:53.032 --> 04:54.299
It was too easy.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.300
Ha ha ha.

04:55.334 --> 04:56.134
You grilling?

04:56.167 --> 04:57.335
No, I'm curing Cancer.

04:57.368 --> 04:58.436
Yes, we're grilling.

04:58.469 --> 04:59.369
Wow.

04:59.402 --> 05:00.337
Damn.

05:00.370 --> 05:02.178
Putting out some btus.

05:02.211 --> 05:04.145
I think those--are those clouds

05:04.179 --> 05:05.513
on fire?

05:05.546 --> 05:06.713
Oh, you noticed that.

05:06.746 --> 05:08.281
Uh, don't worry, sir.

05:08.314 --> 05:10.183
It's just the flavor beam doing

05:10.216 --> 05:13.484
its zesty magic.

05:13.517 --> 05:18.553
You smell burning hair?

05:20.955 --> 05:21.822
Damn it, Shake.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.690
I told him not to mess with that

05:22.723 --> 05:24.524
damn thermostat.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.192
How do I get this to be cold?

05:26.225 --> 05:27.826
I keep pressing it and pressing

05:27.859 --> 05:29.594
it and pressing it, and it won't

05:29.627 --> 05:30.861
get cold now.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.362
242 degrees?!

05:33.396 --> 05:34.363
Man, that's insane!

05:34.397 --> 05:35.263
That's what I've been saying

05:35.297 --> 05:37.065
for the last hour and a half

05:37.099 --> 05:39.100
while you've been dreaming of

05:39.133 --> 05:40.033
Jeannie.

05:40.066 --> 05:40.867
Damn it.

05:40.901 --> 05:41.634
Maybe we gotta freaking

05:41.667 --> 05:42.435
call the landlord.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.202
The compressor's on the fritz

05:43.235 --> 05:44.069
again.

05:44.103 --> 05:45.236
He may--he may be gone.

05:45.269 --> 05:46.604
I wouldn't go out there.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.905
And why not?

05:47.938 --> 05:51.640
Watch this.

05:51.673 --> 05:53.374
That was my Alton Brown

05:53.408 --> 05:54.442
saucepot.

05:54.475 --> 05:56.543
I use it to make my Balsamic

05:56.576 --> 05:57.977
reduction.

05:58.011 --> 06:01.046
Damn it!

06:01.079 --> 06:02.019
You've seen me do it.

06:02.053 --> 06:03.620
Shake, you left that grill

06:03.654 --> 06:04.888
on, didn't you?

06:04.921 --> 06:05.856
Uh, no.

06:05.889 --> 06:06.989
Well, then, why is it on?

06:07.022 --> 06:08.357
I don't know.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.858
It's in self-cleaning mode.

06:09.891 --> 06:10.792
No, I think it's in

06:10.825 --> 06:12.326
create-a-hole-in-the-ozone mode,

06:12.360 --> 06:13.060
Shake.

06:13.093 --> 06:14.194
Someone needs to go out there

06:14.227 --> 06:19.297
now.

06:19.330 --> 06:20.264
And look who I'm looking at.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.498
All right, fine.

06:21.531 --> 06:23.332
I'll go out there.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.468
I need to use the pool anyway.

06:26.501 --> 06:27.369
Whoo!

06:27.402 --> 06:29.103
It is a steamer out--aah!

06:29.136 --> 06:30.871
Aah, aah, aah!

06:30.904 --> 06:32.371
Yeah, it feels great out here!

06:32.405 --> 06:33.938
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

06:33.972 --> 06:35.807
Open the door, open the door!

06:35.840 --> 06:37.508
Aah!

06:37.541 --> 06:38.575
Oh, damn it!

06:38.608 --> 06:40.142
Who took my sunblock?

06:40.176 --> 06:43.178
SPF 60 for fair skin?

06:43.211 --> 06:44.044
There ain't enough SPF in the

06:44.078 --> 06:45.279
world to protect you from this.

06:45.312 --> 06:46.813
Well, we got all that cream

06:46.846 --> 06:48.814
cheese we won at the fair.

06:48.847 --> 06:52.183
Can you tan through that?

06:52.216 --> 06:54.285
It's worth a shot.

06:54.318 --> 06:55.919
And it may be the only shot

06:55.952 --> 07:01.522
we have.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.462
Or we could just shut the

07:02.495 --> 07:04.230
grill off.

07:04.264 --> 07:05.731
Will you relax?

07:05.764 --> 07:06.698
Look.

07:06.732 --> 07:07.633
That thing's gonna shut the

07:07.666 --> 07:09.133
grill off in, like, two seconds.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.067
Oh, my God, it's a tidal

07:10.100 --> 07:10.834
wave!

07:10.867 --> 07:13.502
I know what it is.

07:23.908 --> 07:26.677
Ooh, feel that cool water.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.378
So soothing.

07:28.411 --> 07:29.512
Yeah.

07:29.546 --> 07:32.047
Feel that polar bear up here,

07:32.080 --> 07:33.214
chewing on my head.

07:33.248 --> 07:34.515
Oh, my God.

07:34.549 --> 07:36.150
This is a melted polar cap.

07:36.183 --> 07:37.016
No, no.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.184
Polar caps are traditionally

07:39.217 --> 07:40.185
cold.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.653
Ha ha ha.

07:41.686 --> 07:44.087
This--ooh, this is starting to

07:44.120 --> 07:45.388
get hot.

07:45.421 --> 07:46.289
Oh, hell.

07:46.322 --> 07:47.089
We've got to get to that

07:47.122 --> 07:47.890
grill.

07:47.923 --> 07:48.690
I know.

07:48.723 --> 07:50.858
You said it, like, 93 times.

07:50.891 --> 07:51.792
Hurry, somebody.

07:51.825 --> 07:52.692
Hurry.

07:52.725 --> 07:53.593
Mex--Mexicans!

07:53.626 --> 07:54.426
They'll do it.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.427
They do anything.

07:55.461 --> 07:56.628
Who here knows Spanish?

07:56.662 --> 07:57.628
Carl may!

07:57.662 --> 07:58.363
His hair is dark.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.463
That's a good thought.

07:59.496 --> 08:00.964
I'm gonna ask him.

08:00.997 --> 08:04.940
No, no, no!

08:04.973 --> 08:07.608
My father's amateur porno!

08:07.641 --> 08:09.910
I love you, Dad, and all those

08:09.943 --> 08:13.212
money shots.

08:13.245 --> 08:14.112
Ow.

08:14.145 --> 08:14.979
Damn it.

08:15.013 --> 08:15.846
It's too damn hot.

08:15.879 --> 08:16.814
Frylock!

08:16.847 --> 08:18.047
Use your fries!

08:18.081 --> 08:18.848
Use them!

08:18.881 --> 08:19.782
That's what I'm doing.

08:19.816 --> 08:21.016
Oh.

08:21.049 --> 08:22.317
Well, I couldn't see that

08:22.350 --> 08:23.251
from here.

08:23.284 --> 08:24.484
We gotta stop bickering.

08:24.518 --> 08:25.885
We's all need to join together

08:25.919 --> 08:28.321
and thank God that...

08:28.354 --> 08:29.554
It's on extra low.

08:29.587 --> 08:30.522
Look, will you just blow it

08:30.555 --> 08:31.856
up like you blow up everything

08:31.889 --> 08:32.756
else?

08:32.789 --> 08:33.724
You bought a grill with a

08:33.756 --> 08:34.957
nuclear core, Shake.

08:34.991 --> 08:35.924
That might make us a little bit

08:35.957 --> 08:37.159
worse off.

08:37.192 --> 08:38.659
Der.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.660
That's why it was illegal.

08:40.693 --> 08:41.662
So why can't you just throw

08:41.695 --> 08:42.529
it into space?

08:42.562 --> 08:44.230
Well, I would, but I'd

08:44.263 --> 08:45.197
probably be destroyed in the

08:45.231 --> 08:47.832
process.

08:47.865 --> 08:49.666
So?

08:49.699 --> 08:51.067
Throw it into space.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.068
Yeah, really.

08:52.101 --> 08:54.036
What's the holdup?

08:54.069 --> 08:54.969
Y'all suck.

08:55.003 --> 08:56.804
I wish Superman was here.

08:56.838 --> 08:58.972
I'd say, "Hey, Superman.

08:59.005 --> 08:59.905
Will you mow the lawn while

08:59.939 --> 09:00.773
you're here?"

09:00.806 --> 09:01.707
And he'd be like, "Yeah.

09:01.741 --> 09:02.881
I'm Superman.

09:02.914 --> 09:04.048
I know how to work the mower."

09:10.086 --> 09:12.553
Hey, who bought the grill?

09:12.587 --> 09:13.287
He did.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.655
He did.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.722
Thanks.

09:16.755 --> 09:17.556
Hey, you're welcome,

09:17.590 --> 09:18.491
Mucus Man.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.624
This weather's perfect.

09:19.657 --> 09:21.725
I can finally breathe...

09:21.758 --> 09:22.759
And take over your dumbass

09:22.793 --> 09:23.827
planet.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.261
12 years later, these

09:26.295 --> 09:31.098
selfish, puny humans...

09:32.699 --> 09:33.465
Pass me some more of that

09:33.499 --> 09:34.566
cream cheese, please.

09:38.468 --> 09:39.569
I can't believe they eat

09:39.603 --> 09:41.270
this.

09:41.304 --> 09:42.571
There's no--there's no nutrition

09:42.605 --> 09:43.438
in it.

09:43.471 --> 09:44.372
They don't eat it.

09:44.406 --> 09:45.239
They make more men with it,

09:45.272 --> 09:46.040
Shake.

09:46.073 --> 09:46.873
How many times do I have to tell

09:46.907 --> 09:47.774
you that?

09:47.808 --> 09:48.675
I can't do this anymore.

09:48.709 --> 09:49.842
I think a little chunk of brain

09:49.875 --> 09:51.076
came out last time.

09:51.110 --> 09:52.577
Come on, Carl, you've got to.

09:52.611 --> 09:53.344
You gotta have something

09:53.377 --> 09:54.112
in there.

09:54.145 --> 09:55.045
You gotta blow.

09:55.078 --> 09:56.013
Carl, don't you give up on

09:56.046 --> 09:56.779
me.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.714
I need you to lick this toilet

09:57.747 --> 09:58.680
seat.

09:58.714 --> 09:59.681
Come on, it's our only hope.

09:59.715 --> 10:00.682
No, I'm totally immune to

10:00.716 --> 10:02.022
them germs.

10:02.056 --> 10:03.090
I'm not spitting one more

10:03.123 --> 10:04.024
oyster.

10:04.058 --> 10:05.659
Today, they got to deal with me

10:05.692 --> 10:09.561
on my terms.

10:09.594 --> 10:10.562
What is this dissension in

10:10.595 --> 10:11.695
the ranks?

10:11.728 --> 10:13.196
Someone refuses to blow.

10:13.229 --> 10:14.030
No.

10:14.064 --> 10:15.064
I got something you could blow,

10:15.097 --> 10:15.865
all right.

10:15.898 --> 10:16.731
Carl, no.

10:16.765 --> 10:17.666
But why is he the king?!

10:17.699 --> 10:18.933
Uh, because he is the

10:18.967 --> 10:20.500
smartest and best...

10:20.533 --> 10:23.002
Looking, and his wisdom led us

10:23.035 --> 10:24.536
to this great utopia.

10:24.570 --> 10:26.037
Isn't that right, handsome

10:26.071 --> 10:26.871
master?

10:26.904 --> 10:27.805
Yes.

10:27.838 --> 10:28.973
That is correct.

10:29.006 --> 10:31.240
Mucus minions, congest him.

10:31.274 --> 10:31.940
At once.

10:31.974 --> 10:32.775
No, Meatwad.

10:32.808 --> 10:33.441
Please.

10:33.475 --> 10:34.109
Come on!

10:34.142 --> 10:34.776
It'll take two of you.

10:34.809 --> 10:35.943
Let's go.

10:35.977 --> 10:37.243
No!

10:37.277 --> 10:38.078
And it doesn't use

10:38.111 --> 10:39.212
carbon-based fossil fuels or

10:39.245 --> 10:40.946
emit Chlorofluorocarbons, or

10:40.980 --> 10:42.547
CFCS, which are the main

10:42.581 --> 10:45.682
culprits behind global warming.

10:45.716 --> 10:46.949
That's why you gotta eat your

10:46.983 --> 10:49.818
boogers.

10:49.851 --> 10:52.186
Before the Mucuzoids take over.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.653
That's the message I'm spreading

10:53.687 --> 10:56.589
to America.

10:56.622 --> 10:59.123
Our future's at stake, and it's

10:59.157 --> 11:00.724
in your nose.

11:00.757 --> 11:02.332
You must eat your boogers,

11:02.365 --> 11:04.967
America, for the sake of your

11:05.000 --> 11:08.736
grandchildren's lives.
