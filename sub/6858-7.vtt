00:17.600 --> 00:18.934
NARRATOR: Criminals captured!

00:19.019 --> 00:21.937
Jedi Master Plo Koon
and Padawan Ahsoka Tano

00:22.022 --> 00:24.940
successfully thwarted an attempt
on Mace Windu's life,

00:25.025 --> 00:28.360
killing bounty hunter Aurra Sing
in the process.

00:28.445 --> 00:33.032
Since that time, young Ahsoka
has grown strong in the ways of the Force.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.702
Now, after several harrowing adventures
alongside her master,

00:36.786 --> 00:41.790
the two Jedi have returned to the Temple
on Coruscant to receive their next mission.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.796
Welcome, Padawan.
In order, congratulations are.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.591
Shown your courage and strength
yet again, you have.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.260
Job well done, Ahsoka.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.598
And now, on to more pressing matters.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.142
To Balith, you must go, Skywalker.

01:00.268 --> 01:04.980
There's a large-scale civil war on Balith.
They have requested our assistance.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.150
Anakin, you will leave immediately
to command the third legion.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.610
I've never been to Balith.

01:09.652 --> 01:13.739
You will stay here, Padawan,
we need your full report.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.991
As you wish.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.167
Ahsoka, I sense you are uneasy. What is it?

01:25.251 --> 01:26.251
Oh...

01:26.461 --> 01:28.962
I... Nothing.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.673
Master, let me come with you.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.510
If I'm not with you,
who else will have your back?

01:34.844 --> 01:38.514
Stay here, finish your studies,
get some rest.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.684
You've said it yourself. I learn more
in the field than I ever do here.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.271
Well, think of this
as a chance to prove me wrong.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.863
And stay out of trouble.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.964
(GRUNTING)

02:12.382 --> 02:15.926
She will die,
and there's nothing that you can do.

(GASPING)

02:23.184 --> 02:24.226
(DOORBELL RINGING)

02:24.269 --> 02:25.727
Enter.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.730
Have a seat, young Padawan.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.491
Troubled you are, Padawan?

02:39.576 --> 02:43.412
Yes, Master Yoda,
I've been having dreams.

02:43.913 --> 02:44.913
Hmm.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.707
Dreams, you say?

02:47.375 --> 02:50.210
Yes, dreams... Or visions.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.213
I don't know, but they're so real.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.217
Premonitions. Telling you something,
they are.

02:57.260 --> 03:03.098
I know I reported otherwise,
but I believe that Aurra Sing isn't dead.

03:03.224 --> 03:07.227
She's still alive, and she's preparing
to kill someone close to me.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.190
So, you begin to see
the true power of the Force.

03:11.274 --> 03:15.402
Visions, they are.
Underestimate them, you must not.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.907
Meditate. To see clearly,
more experience you need.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.790
These should help you
with your studies, dear.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.962
Study! I should be out there fighting!
Not in here studying.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.432
-Kill her.
-With pleasure.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.692
Senator Amidala is in danger.

04:02.867 --> 04:07.788
Senator, Padawan Ahsoka Tano
is here to see you.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.164
Senator Amidala.

04:09.207 --> 04:13.919
Ahsoka, it's so good to see you.
How have you been?

04:14.003 --> 04:16.546
Honestly? I've been better.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.259
I'm worried for you, Senator.
I sense you are in grave danger.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.679
What makes you believe that?

04:24.347 --> 04:28.016
I've been having dreams. Bad dreams.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.687
Padmé, I know you're in danger.
I just know it.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.272
What kind of danger?

04:33.356 --> 04:37.401
I believe that a very dangerous
bounty hunter is out to assassinate you.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.694
(SIGHS)

04:39.028 --> 04:41.029
This is troubling.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.949
Captain, please take
all necessary precautions.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.784
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

04:45.868 --> 04:50.080
Bail Organa and I are leading a conference
concerning the refugees from the war.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.873
I leave for Alderaan in the morning.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.917
But the threat to your life!

04:54.002 --> 04:57.754
Ahsoka, the refugee situation
is much too crucial to ignore.

04:57.839 --> 05:02.301
I called this conference. It could make
an enormous difference in policy.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.885
It's vital that I go.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.972
Yes, Senator.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.669
I am sure now that it is Senator Amidala
who is in danger.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.296
Senator Amidala, you say?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.466
Yes, Master. I've seen it in my visions.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.011
Choose, you must,
how to respond to your visions.

05:46.095 --> 05:50.057
But remember,
always in motion is the future

05:50.141 --> 05:53.393
and many possible futures there are.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.395
Yes, Master.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.487
Senator!

06:03.946 --> 06:05.739
Ahsoka, what is it?

06:05.990 --> 06:09.910
I can't just stay behind
knowing about the threat to your life.

06:09.994 --> 06:12.954
Allow me to come with you, please.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.416
I suppose it couldn't hurt.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.544
Besides, I enjoy your company.

06:19.629 --> 06:23.548
Of course you can join me,
as extra security.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.594
Thank you, Padmé.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.779

06:51.160 --> 06:52.369
(LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY)

06:53.830 --> 06:58.041
You'll learn to play in time, Ahsoka.
Someday you'll even beat me.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.585
It's not that.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.337
What's on your mind?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.924
I've been mostly unsure about my abilities
on my own.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.593
Usually, Master Skywalker is there
to guide me.

07:09.262 --> 07:14.015
When I was Queen, I felt
the same insecurities as you do now.

07:14.058 --> 07:19.729
I had my advisors, but it was ultimately
up to me to run the entire Naboo system,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.732
and I was very afraid at times.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.610
Really? You felt unsure?

07:26.362 --> 07:33.201
Oh, yes, but I have learned
to trust in myself, and you will, too.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.370
Thank you.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.540
-One more game?
-Absolutely.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.936
It's begun.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.731
(GASPING)

08:03.024 --> 08:04.441
Padmé!

08:05.401 --> 08:07.068
The assassin's inside!

08:09.697 --> 08:11.072
Ahsoka!

08:11.157 --> 08:12.657
Stay down!

08:16.954 --> 08:18.079
What's going on?

08:19.707 --> 08:21.374
Nothing.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.212
False alarm. Forgive me, Senator.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.467
Are you all right, my lady?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.928
Yes, Captain, I'm fine.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.454
-Padmé.
-Bail, it's so good to see you.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.831
Thank you so much
for hosting this conference.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.585
Dealing with the refugees of this war
needs to be our number one priority.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.673
Absolutely! Your presence here
is greatly appreciated.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.635
Come. Senator Mothma and I
will take you to your quarters.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.967
Senator, might I have a word
with you in private?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.470
Of course, Padawan Tano.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.180
If you'll excuse me.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.855
I know I made a mistake last night,

10:06.981 --> 10:09.691
but that doesn't mean
the threat to you is any less.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.860
I haven't lost faith in you, Ahsoka.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.155
I know, and I appreciate that.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.658
I don't mean to interject,
but now is not the time for this.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.036
Senator Amidala must prepare
for her summit.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.331
But I believe the attempt on your life
is going to happen tonight.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.582
Why tonight?

10:25.708 --> 10:28.543
I had another vision
and it was much clearer.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.880
I could see more than usual,
even a location.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.174
It was a large room,
you were giving a speech.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.218
This room,
could you recognize it if you saw it?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.012
Yes, I think I could.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.233
So, does anything look familiar?

10:52.276 --> 10:56.613
Yes, this is it.
This is the place I saw in my vision.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.406
Where would the assassin be?

10:58.449 --> 11:01.076
That's the part I'm not sure of.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.913
We are taking all the necessary
precautions, correct, Captain?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.122
Yes, my lady.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.043
But Aurra Sing will know
what you plan to do. She'll find a way in.

11:10.086 --> 11:14.422
Ahsoka, in your vision,
does Aurra succeed?

11:14.548 --> 11:16.758
I... I can't tell.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.595
Well, then,
at least we have a fighting chance.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.603
Isn't it just beautiful?

11:28.646 --> 11:32.816
Yes, but I really must insist
you go back inside.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.776
It's not safe for you out here.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.779
Ahsoka, I can't stop living my life.

11:37.905 --> 11:42.450
You forget, I'm a friend of the Jedi.
I'm no stranger to taking risks.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.791
-What is it?
-I'm confused.

11:49.834 --> 11:54.587
My visions are telling me one thing,
but reality is telling me another.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.840
I don't know which to believe anymore!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.926
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe no one's out to kill you.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.811
As the conflict that
divides our galaxy escalates,

12:09.937 --> 12:15.984
we cannot lose perspective on
the value of life and the price of freedom.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.862
No one knows this truth more

12:18.988 --> 12:23.658
than the distinguished senator,
Padmé Amidala of Naboo.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.493
Thank you, Senator Organa.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.954
I wanted to first thank you all for coming.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.749
This is a cause
that is very important to me.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.960
I can remember, after the illegal blockade
of my home world Naboo

12:34.003 --> 12:38.840
by the Trade Federation,
how many lives were thrown into chaos.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.428
True, in the grand scale of things,
it was a small conflict.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.348
And true, there was only one battle
fought during the occupation,

12:47.475 --> 12:50.935
but let us examine the cost
of that one conflict.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.689
Hundreds of Naboo
were forced from their homes,

12:54.774 --> 12:58.026
Naboo security forces
and the Gungan army

12:58.152 --> 12:59.861
both incurred heavy casualties,

12:59.987 --> 13:04.491
and the life of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn
was lost.

13:04.533 --> 13:09.329
And yet, now I find myself a party to
and witness of a full-scale war

13:09.371 --> 13:12.123
that has divided our great republic in two.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.792

It was only a flesh wound.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.543
Padmé, I'm sorry.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.296
For what, Ahsoka? You did all you could.

14:00.381 --> 14:04.050
-Did you find the assassin?
-She ran off before I could get her.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.469
-She?
-Yes, she.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.889
I am positive now that it is Aurra Sing
who is out to get you.

14:09.974 --> 14:14.269
Please return to Coruscant immediately,
for your own safety.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.063
Padmé, I agree with the Padawan.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.858
It is far too dangerous for you
to give your speech tonight.

14:19.942 --> 14:24.571
If someone wants me dead,
they will follow me wherever I go.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.365
But you know my visions are all mixed up.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.285
What if what I saw was the attempt
that just happened?

14:30.369 --> 14:33.663
Padmé, I am not willing
to gamble with your life.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.998
Wait a minute.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.167
I think I have a way we can get around
putting you in jeopardy

against those who would stand up
for truth and justice.

We have a responsibility as the
elected representatives of the Republic

15:54.453 --> 15:59.707
to face our fears and challenge those
who threaten the safety of its people.

but not beaten.

PADMÉ: The soldiers who so valiantly fight
to protect us

16:19.561 --> 16:21.688
must also be protected
once their job is done.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.064
She's not in this room.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.567
We need legislation to defend
the displaced from slavery,

16:26.652 --> 16:28.277
to protect our soldiers from feeling

16:28.362 --> 16:31.239
as if there is no future
beyond their warfare,

16:31.323 --> 16:33.658
and we must open channels
though diplomacy

16:33.742 --> 16:36.327
so that we can end this war.

I know there are those among the
Separatists who would end this conflict,

16:40.749 --> 16:42.917
and I know there are those individuals
in the galaxy

16:43.002 --> 16:45.670
who would seek to promote fear
and spread chaos.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.259
To those that act as agents of chaos,
I say this.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.344
I stand resolute and unyielding.

And if you strike my voice down,

know that a chorus of thousands
shall rise up in its place.

over the righteous.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.984
Why are you doing this?
Killing me will not stop the relief effort.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.823
Honey, this isn't about your cause.
This is about revenge.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.328
My employer wants to get even with you,
simple as that.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.246
Who hired you?

18:02.498 --> 18:06.501
Enough talk!
Time to see what you're made of, kid.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
(GROANING)

18:11.298 --> 18:12.298
(LAUGHING)

18:13.509 --> 18:14.509
No!

18:18.680 --> 18:21.349
-Ahsoka!
-Nice shot.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.186
I told you, I'm no stranger to taking risks.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.399
-Senator!
-Captain, she's stunned.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.895
Are you all right?

19:08.021 --> 19:12.900
Without Ahsoka's foresight, I fear things
would have gone quite differently.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.029
Serve you well, your visions have,
young Padawan.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.699
Thank you, Master Yoda.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.910
But we still don't know
who's really behind this.

19:23.078 --> 19:28.124
Hmm. Concentrate, remember.
What do you see?

19:30.377 --> 19:34.046
I see shapes.

19:35.799 --> 19:39.719
Large, devouring...

19:41.054 --> 19:44.098
I hear laughter.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.310
Bizarre laughter.

19:47.436 --> 19:53.608
And purple? I see a color, purple.

19:55.402 --> 20:00.114
I don't know what it means,
none of it is familiar to me.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.033
It is to me.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.786
I've been thinking, Aurra Sing said
the person who hired her

20:05.913 --> 20:08.748
simply wanted revenge
for something I did to them.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.583
Well, that could be a lot of people.

20:10.626 --> 20:17.381
Yes, but with Ahsoka's added details,
I know someone who fits the description.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.148
Ziro.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.316
Oh.

20:35.651 --> 20:39.237
You must be Anakin Skywalker.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.323
Have you met my Padawan, Ahsoka Tano?

20:42.574 --> 20:45.159
(CHUCKLING) Padawan.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.330
I believe you have a grudge
against Senator Amidala.

20:49.456 --> 20:55.795
And what makes you say something
so utterly ridiculous, youngling?

20:55.837 --> 20:59.131
It's because of Senator Amidala
you're locked up in this place.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.760
The bounty hunter Aurra Sing
attempted to kill the Senator.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.845
I believe you hired her for the job.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.014
I did no such thing!

21:07.140 --> 21:11.185
We have Aurra Sing in custody.
She told us everything.

21:11.770 --> 21:16.941
(STAMMERING) But... What? She told you...
She told you what? Impossible.

21:17.317 --> 21:20.194
I should have hired someone better.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.279
Oh.

21:21.363 --> 21:27.159
You just guaranteed yourself an extra-long
vacation in this lovely establishment.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.706
Do you see the conditions I'm living in?

21:31.790 --> 21:36.669
That... That insipid senator put me in here!

21:36.753 --> 21:41.340
She deserves to die for leaving me
to rot in this squalor!

21:41.425 --> 21:44.844
Well, thanks to you, Ziro,
and that little confession,

21:44.928 --> 21:47.430
you've just officially failed.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.390
You'll never get away with this!

21:50.892 --> 21:54.645
You have no idea what I'm capable of!
