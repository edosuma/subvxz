05:48.248 --> 05:50.082

were placed forming
a horseshoe pattern.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.753
Then a massive ring
of these giant stones

that Stonehenge was a place
of unexplainable healing

22:29.649 --> 22:34.285

of the bluestones at its center.

22:34.287 --> 22:37.021
Geoffrey of Monmouth, -- he says
these are healing stones,

22:37.023 --> 22:40.324

I thought science was gonna
come in and crush my dream,

41:12.037 --> 41:17.841
so it's unexpected
and really encouraging and cool

41:17.843 --> 41:21.411
that this sort of lines up
and validates the theory

41:21.413 --> 41:23.880
that these were used
for healing.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.183
While my brain-scan results
do strengthen the theory,

41:27.185 --> 41:30.420
we'd need way more data
for anything to be definitive.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.291
For me, this investigation
has revealed

41:35.293 --> 41:39.496
why Stonehenge is such
a seductive mystery.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.698
People were willing to walk
hundreds of miles

41:41.700 --> 41:44.834
in excruciating pain
just to see it.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.804
It sits on land that is believed
to be pulsing

41:47.806 --> 41:50.874
with an invisible
and powerful energy,

41:50.876 --> 41:52.775
and the massive stones
themselves

41:52.777 --> 41:54.644
carried hundreds of miles

41:54.646 --> 41:57.280
because they have
the ability to heal.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.582
Like expanding
your consciousness

41:59.584 --> 42:03.253
just by being here
and taking it in.

42:03.255 --> 42:06.389
With every step
we take towards the truth,

42:06.391 --> 42:09.325
we unravel more
of humanity's story --

42:09.327 --> 42:14.097
where we come from, who we are,
and where we're going.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.466
Maybe one day
Stonehenge will reveal

42:16.468 --> 42:18.868
its deepest, darkest secrets...

42:18.870 --> 42:20.670
One of the great mysteries
of the world,

42:20.672 --> 42:22.338
and we're standing
in the middle of it.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.274
...and I hope I'm there
when it does.
