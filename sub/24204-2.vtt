-Previously on Siren...
-Bring it in!

00:06.710 --> 00:08.200
We caught something
out there.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.246
It attacked Chris.
He had to get airlifted out.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.286

commando helicopter.

00:12.290 --> 00:13.279
[Ben] You really don't know
what attacked him?

00:13.290 --> 00:15.281
[Xander]
This was a predator.

00:15.290 --> 00:17.497
[boy] 150 years ago,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.957
a local fishing captain
fell in love with a mermaid

00:19.960 --> 00:21.325
in these very waters.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.241
[Decker] Had a report
six weeks ago,

00:23.250 --> 00:25.320
Japanese fisherman
claimed he saw
a sea creature.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.036
We knew something
was out there.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.029
That's when I alerted
your people.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.496
[Ben]
You okay?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.036
Little girl
runnin' away from home.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.706
[Donnie screams]

00:34.880 --> 00:36.245
You're sick. Can I see?

00:36.250 --> 00:38.241
Oh. Hey.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.535
[Ben] This is Ryn. I don't
think she speaks English.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.871
[coughs]

00:40.880 --> 00:42.245
[gasping]

00:42.250 --> 00:45.458
Your ancestors slaughtered
those beautiful creatures.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.281
-Genocide-- that's your legacy.
-[shrieking]

00:48.290 --> 00:49.871
Hey, we got somethin'.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.495
Wow, that's big.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.535
Whoa, whoa, look.

-Aah! t!

01:08.710 --> 01:10.246
What the hell?!

01:10.250 --> 01:11.956
You don't want to do that.
That could kill it.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.200
Thought you said
you came out here
to help us.

01:13.210 --> 01:16.031
I had a clean shot
till you stepped in.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.167
Almost like you don't
want us catching it.

01:18.170 --> 01:21.162
Look, if this thing really is
what you think it is,

01:21.170 --> 01:23.377
we need to protect it,
not kill it.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.245
Ugh!

01:25.250 --> 01:27.821
We want what belongs to us,

01:27.830 --> 01:29.570
and we want
to get Chris back.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.377
If you don't want
the same thing,

01:31.380 --> 01:32.950
I don't know what the hell
you're doing on the boat.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.370
-Shh, shh!

01:40.170 --> 01:43.321
It's like, I don't know,
it's injured?

01:43.330 --> 01:46.493
[call continues]

01:46.500 --> 01:48.240
Maybe I hit it.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.739
It's underneath.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.115
It's underneath the boat!

01:54.120 --> 01:55.326
We gotta get it.

01:57.580 --> 01:58.956

02:40.620 --> 02:42.417
[Xander]

03:26.330 --> 03:29.618
[high-pitched call
from device]

03:29.620 --> 03:31.747
It might be
a Doppler current profiler.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.662
Oceanographers uses them
to study current patterns.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.955
When we had the creature
in the hold,

03:35.960 --> 03:38.110
it... it made a sound,

03:38.120 --> 03:40.281
not too different
from the sound this thing makes.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.451
Right.

03:42.460 --> 03:46.908
Well, there's a lot
of scientific monitoring
devices floating out there.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.114
Could be a lot of things.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.451
Well, just think about it.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.280
We were out here, what,
like, a few days ago?

03:51.290 --> 03:52.370
And this thing wasn't here.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.415
And then we catch
that creature,

03:53.420 --> 03:55.035
and, all of a sudden,
it just appears?

03:55.040 --> 03:56.450
Somebody put it here.
It's gotta be connected.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.325
Yeah, you could be right.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.535
[beeping]

04:03.540 --> 04:05.371
You know, that was, um...

04:05.380 --> 04:06.574
That was a pretty sick thing
you did back there,

04:06.580 --> 04:08.377
diving in like that.

04:08.380 --> 04:11.201
Yeah. Well, it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.418
Look, I'm sorry,

04:14.420 --> 04:16.411
okay, ifI pissed you off
earlier.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.706
I just feel differently
about it than you guys.

04:18.710 --> 04:21.281
It doesn't mean that I
don't want to find Chris.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.536
I appreciate it.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.451
For real.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.200
Couldn't tell,

04:28.210 --> 04:29.416
'cause you were being
such a dick about it.

04:34.710 --> 04:35.950
What is it?

04:37.710 --> 04:41.328
I don't know.
This thing looks
like a camera.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.787
There's probably some kind
of tracking device on it, too.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.246
We should try to disable it.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.990
I say we just power it up
and set it off.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.116
Let the military come.
They'll lead us to Chris,

04:49.120 --> 04:50.496
and maybe they got
the mermaid, too.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.285
I wouldn't.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.570
You saw what happened
the last time they came.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.741
We could all end up
like Chris.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.378
We just need to take our time

04:59.380 --> 05:02.417
and try to ﬁgure out
what this thing really is.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.241
Oh. Lovely.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.239
[sniffs]

16:24.250 --> 16:25.569
You need food.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.913
-[sniffing]
-Humans love to eat.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.240
We do most
of our hunting

16:32.250 --> 16:34.036
in a supermarket.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.115
Oh, no. No. Uh-uh!

16:47.250 --> 16:50.117
Please, give.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.667
Give.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.160
Thank you.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.070
I think I know
what you need.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.163
You stay here.

16:58.170 --> 17:00.286
I'll go get you food.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.111
Then we'll_ look
for your Sister.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.417
Okay?

17:04.420 --> 17:05.785
[hiss]

17:10.620 --> 17:12.076
[locks door]

17:14.710 --> 17:16.075
[bell jingling]

17:19.290 --> 17:22.111
[locks door]

17:22.120 --> 17:25.032
[Ben] There's
something else, Maddie.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.576
When I went out with Xander,

17:26.580 --> 17:29.162
we found this device
in the water.

17:29.170 --> 17:32.537
Some kind of
military tracking device.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.747
I think
they're looking for her.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.207
The military?
This is crazy.

17:37.210 --> 17:39.997
Does anyone else
know about her?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.288
Uh, yeah, just the guys
on the boat

17:43.290 --> 17:45.110
and Miss Hawkins.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.280
Helen Hawkins?

17:46.290 --> 17:48.576
You told her?
Why would you do that?

17:48.580 --> 17:50.992
She was talking
to that girl on the street.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.787
I-- It looked like she knew
something about her,

17:53.790 --> 17:54.916
so I went to talk to her.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.376
Well, what did she say?

17:56.380 --> 17:57.779
She started talking
about my family, Maddie.

17:57.790 --> 18:00.327
She was saying I should
ask my dad about it.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.536
Your dad?

18:01.540 --> 18:04.668
Well, did you talk to him?

18:04.670 --> 18:06.820
-Not yet.
-[computer beeps]

18:06.830 --> 18:08.286
It's done.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.326
All the video's
downloaded.

18:10.330 --> 18:14.243
This thing,
it attacked you,

18:14.250 --> 18:16.241
it-- it got Chris.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.286
It's dangerous.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.248
If we're _
gonna go after It,
try to track it down,

18:21.250 --> 18:22.239
we need to be careful.

18:24.290 --> 18:25.166
You're right.

18:29.580 --> 18:32.708
Dude, you know what?
You were right.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.246
It makes sense.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.990
We reconnect
the tracking eqUIpment,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.410
we power that thing up,

18:37.420 --> 18:38.569
and when the military
comes, boom!

18:38.580 --> 18:39.786
We ambush them.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.030
You need to calm down.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.325
We are not gonna
ambush the military.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.877
-Calm down?
-Yeah.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.416
You sound just like Ben.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.615
Okay, look, you don't
know him like I do, all right?

18:47.620 --> 18:49.747
Look, I told you,
stop listening to him!

18:49.750 --> 18:51.240
He's got no clue
what we're dealing
with right now.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.457
Pretty sure he's
one of the only people

18:53.460 --> 18:55.416
that actually does
have_ a clue what we're
dealing wrth right now,

18:55.420 --> 18:57.411
so maybe you should just
give him a little faith,
all right?

19:07.170 --> 19:09.741
[Ted] That's
a good run of sockeye.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.570
Enjoy it while it lasts.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.116
Yeah, I worry
about that, too,

19:13.120 --> 19:14.951
but I also worry
about people.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.872
And right now, I'm giving
good jobs to folks
who need them.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.495
I wanted to ask you
something.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.242
I remember
that you and Grandpa

19:22.250 --> 19:24.161
used to talk
about Charles Pownall,

19:24.170 --> 19:27.492
about what really happened
back then.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.287
You really come here
to ask me that?

19:30.290 --> 19:31.416
Yeah.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.110
Why the sudden interest
in the family history?

19:38.880 --> 19:39.949
I ran into Helen Hawkins.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.951
Oh, come on.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.372
Dad?

19:44.380 --> 19:46.996
Maybe I'd show up
to more family events

19:47.000 --> 19:48.820
like the statue unveiling

19:48.830 --> 19:51.913
if you told me
the real story
about our family.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.916
All right.

19:56.830 --> 20:03.326
Look, Charles
might not have been exactly
who we make him out to be.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.877
I can't say for sure,

20:04.880 --> 20:06.279
but there might have been
some mental illness,

20:06.290 --> 20:08.918
maybe even schizophrenia.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.411
Long months at sea,
a constant stream of booze,

20:11.420 --> 20:15.379
and, uh,
well, he was seeing things.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.280
[chuckles] Mermaids?

20:17.290 --> 20:20.782
You know this.
You did the play in school.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.451
That's how the town
got Its folklore.

20:22.460 --> 20:23.996
Now, as for Helen
and her stories,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.321
well, we all know she's
got a vivid imagination.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.280
That's it?

20:30.290 --> 20:31.416
That's it.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.108
Why?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.616
Dad, I gotta go.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.821
I'll take
a pound of mussels.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.492
Oh, and a pound
of clams.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.242
Yeah, make sure
you get the big ones.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.569
Shrimp--
give me two dozen shrimp

20:54.580 --> 20:56.320
and some scallops.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.992
Yeah, a little bit
of that sockeye, crab.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.410
Actually, make that two.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.456
I'll take two, two crabs.
Thanks, yeah.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.530
No, that's a baby.
I'm gonna have
to get something else.

21:04.540 --> 21:07.111
That nice, big salmon
over there?

21:07.120 --> 21:09.202
Thank you.

21:09.210 --> 21:10.916
Anything else?

21:10.920 --> 21:13.206
Got any sardines?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.740
[Xander] Calvin?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.115
Hey, Calvin!

21:24.210 --> 21:25.416
Yeah?

21:25.420 --> 21:26.956
Did you move it?

21:26.960 --> 21:28.416
What, the thing?
No, I didn't touch it.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.990
Well, it's gone.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.701
You see?

21:34.710 --> 21:36.109
See what?

21:37.960 --> 21:40.747
The military came
and took the mermaid,

21:40.750 --> 21:42.456
took Chris,

21:42.460 --> 21:44.416
and now they came in here
and took the thing.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.411
We shouldn't even be
talking in here right now.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.708
[helicopters]

22:06.250 --> 22:08.571
[heart monitor beeping]

22:25.750 --> 22:27.286
Where am I?

22:33.580 --> 22:35.411
What's happening?

22:52.790 --> 22:54.417
[Maddie] They've been
out here all this time,

22:54.420 --> 22:56.240
so why
are they showing up now?

22:56.250 --> 22:57.820
[Ben] I was
thinking the same thing
when I was at my dad's.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.661
What do you mean?

22:59.670 --> 23:01.410
Something brought her
closer to the surface,
all right?

23:01.420 --> 23:03.786
Maybe it's the change
in the oceans, you know?

23:03.790 --> 23:05.917
Maybe she's looking
for a new food source.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.115
-Same as our sea lions.
-RIght.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.451
Thanks to my family.

23:09.460 --> 23:11.109
[Ben sighs]

23:22.670 --> 23:25.241
Helen Hawkins seems to know
a lot about this stuff.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.491
I'm hoping
she'll have some answers.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.456
[Maddie]
Well, there she is.

23:29.460 --> 23:30.666
The town nut job.

23:32.380 --> 23:33.699
[Ben] Yeah.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.577
Maybe don't say that
in front of her.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.668
[bell jingling]

23:42.670 --> 23:46.458
Oh, uh, shop's closed.

23:46.460 --> 23:47.950
Sorry to bother you,

23:47.960 --> 23:49.575
but I just had a few more
questions I wanted to ask you.

23:49.580 --> 23:52.617
You told her?

23:52.620 --> 23:54.827
Yeah.
We can trust her.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.663
It's not about trust.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.535
No one else can know.

23:59.540 --> 24:03.533
These creatures
were massacred once.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.780
It could happen again.

24:04.790 --> 24:07.111
Look, we're not
gonna tell anyone, okay?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.200
We want to protect them, too.

24:08.210 --> 24:09.575
[chuckles]

24:09.580 --> 24:13.573
I, uh, told you
everything I know.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.570
-[rattling]
-She's gone,

24:18.580 --> 24:21.208
probably a hundred miles
out in the ocean by now.

24:26.540 --> 24:27.871
[hissing]

24:27.880 --> 24:29.529
[toilet flushing]

24:29.540 --> 24:31.371
Is everything okay?

24:31.380 --> 24:34.167
Plumbing issues.
It's an old building.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.910
I have things to do,

24:35.920 --> 24:37.740
so if you don't mind...

24:37.750 --> 24:39.877
This is just gonna
take a second.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.035
[sniffing]

24:43.040 --> 24:44.871
We found this in the water.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.745
I was wondering if you could
tell me what this sound is.

24:46.750 --> 24:50.538
[high-pitched call]

24:50.540 --> 24:54.579
[shrieking]

24:54.580 --> 24:56.320
[high-pitched call]

24:57.330 --> 24:58.376
Turn it off.

24:58.380 --> 25:00.496

25:05.830 --> 25:07.878
[screaming]

25:07.880 --> 25:09.575
[piercing shriek]

25:09.580 --> 25:10.877
[shrieking]

25:10.880 --> 25:11.869
Aah!

25:16.670 --> 25:18.820
Turn it off now!

25:22.040 --> 25:24.372
[screaming]

25:26.080 --> 25:27.957
[rattling]

25:31.620 --> 25:32.871
Aah!

25:32.880 --> 25:36.372
[device beeping

25:36.380 --> 25:37.665
[screaming]

25:37.670 --> 25:39.240
Sister!

25:51.960 --> 25:53.370

Close it, close it!

25:56.120 --> 25:58.202
[beeping and calling]

25:58.210 --> 25:59.825
[Ryn] Sister!

25:59.830 --> 26:01.741
Sister!

26:01.750 --> 26:03.206
That sound is your sister?

26:03.210 --> 26:05.667
She's not in there.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.535
It's-- It's just a recording.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.320
[Helen] Only sound.

26:11.330 --> 26:13.286
[calling stops]

26:13.290 --> 26:14.370
Better?

26:16.250 --> 26:17.820
[panﬁng]

26:19.710 --> 26:21.746
There were two of them
out there.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.877
Her sister's
the one who got caught.

26:23.880 --> 26:24.619
[hisses]

26:26.330 --> 26:27.740
-[groans]
-What?

26:27.750 --> 26:29.991
[sizzling]

26:30.000 --> 26:32.491
Aah!

26:32.500 --> 26:34.707

Aah!

26:43.210 --> 26:46.577
[Ryn gasping]

26:46.580 --> 26:47.740
Whoa.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.536
Are you okay?

26:54.540 --> 26:55.700
[panﬁng]

27:01.920 --> 27:04.912
[Ben]
Look, I get it.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.822
You came back
to find your sister, right?

27:10.750 --> 27:13.287
We can help you.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.780
Okay.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.200
Yes.

27:20.210 --> 27:21.700
She understands.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.746
They're highly intelligent.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.661
[laughs]
More so than humans.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.160
Okay.

27:32.170 --> 27:35.412
Ben, her sister
could be anywhere.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.741
How would we find her?

27:37.750 --> 27:38.956
I don't know.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.997
We should probably
start with Xander.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.786
I want to hear again
what happened out there.

27:43.790 --> 27:44.996
Maybe there's
something I missed.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.949
Look.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.951
Wait, wait.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.575
Hey! She--

27:55.580 --> 27:57.616
She can't just go out
into the world.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.911
Do we have a choice?

28:00.920 --> 28:03.536
Bring her back later.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.201
She's safe with me.

28:06.170 --> 28:10.459
[mermaid languidly calling]

28:20.790 --> 28:22.997
I'm sorry.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.820
I'm sorry we did that to you.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.663
[singing Siren song]

28:34.880 --> 28:38.782
[singing continues]

29:04.670 --> 29:06.877
So how long
did you know him?

29:06.880 --> 29:08.996
He moved in
about eight months ago.

29:09.000 --> 29:09.910
Mm-hmm.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.205
Liked to party,

29:11.210 --> 29:12.916
had a lot of girlfriends.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.319
Drugs.

29:14.330 --> 29:15.877
Uh, not a bad guy,

29:15.880 --> 29:17.495
but not good, either.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.661
Well, he's
not either anymore.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.206
Listen, if you think
of anything else,

29:21.210 --> 29:22.416
give me a call,
all right?

29:22.420 --> 29:23.409
[Vicki] Sheriff?

29:23.420 --> 29:24.705
Oh, boy.

29:24.710 --> 29:25.995
Phillip.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.661
Vicki.

29:27.670 --> 29:28.659
I have a crime to report.

29:28.670 --> 29:30.490
Yeah?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.957
This little homeless girl's been
stealing clothing off my line.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.370
She got my daughter's
Huskies sweatshirt,

29:34.380 --> 29:36.029
this morning, a T-shirt.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.247
I went out to confront her,

29:38.250 --> 29:40.491
and she threw
a damn metal pole at me.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.957
Almost took my head off.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.325
Is that right?

29:46.420 --> 29:47.819
What'd she look like?

30:01.040 --> 30:03.031
-[phone vibrating]
-[gasp51

30:03.040 --> 30:05.702
Xander? Hey, yeah, I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.109
Where are you?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.826
[phone beeps]

30:08.830 --> 30:09.910
He's at The Anchor.

-No.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.451
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.700
Wait, wait.

30:39.710 --> 30:42.110
Too many people.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.281
-It's not safe. Not safe.
-[hIts wrndow]

30:45.330 --> 30:46.661
You stay here.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.206
I'll stay with her.

30:49.670 --> 30:51.661
We'll stay together.

30:51.670 --> 30:54.457
Then we'll-- Then--
Then we'll look
for your sister.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.826
Are you sure?

30:56.830 --> 30:57.910
Yeah.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.490
Do you wanna--

31:00.500 --> 31:02.036
You wanna wait
outSIde the car?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.667
I'll be okay.

31:06.790 --> 31:09.281
All right. Be careful.

31:10.830 --> 31:11.990
[panﬁng]

31:24.960 --> 31:26.370

Bird.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.532
My dad is Haida.

32:14.540 --> 32:17.748
They talk about how the raven
was the maker of things.

32:20.290 --> 32:24.499
They say he put the sun
and moon in the slq,

32:24.500 --> 32:28.209
brought fresh water
and fire to the land.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.743
They say he found
the first people
inside a giant clamshell.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.611
Bird.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.531
It's just a story.

32:44.670 --> 32:45.989
Made up.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.957
Some things are real,

32:49.960 --> 32:53.077
others are just stories.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.160
[exhales]

32:56.330 --> 32:58.378
This, real.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.069
This.

33:04.290 --> 33:05.530
Real.

33:09.830 --> 33:10.956
Real.

33:17.670 --> 33:19.114
Yes.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.031
You're real.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.490
[Ben] Okay,
so Chris gets attacked,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.786
and your dad
calls in the evac?

33:40.790 --> 33:42.246
Yeah.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.535
The military
must have been listening,

33:43.540 --> 33:46.202
or CG tipped them off.
I don't know.

33:46.210 --> 33:48.280
Did it look like there was
someone In charge?

33:48.290 --> 33:49.609
Yeah.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.248
Okay, so what--
what did he look like?

33:52.250 --> 33:55.117
Uh... he was a black dude.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.076
Okay, anything else
about him?

33:57.080 --> 33:59.207
I don't know why this is
any of your damn business.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.247
[Xander] It's like they were
waitin' for us all along.

34:03.250 --> 34:07.323
Like, if it's
the military, man,

34:07.330 --> 34:08.786
then they are watching us.

34:08.790 --> 34:09.916
They know stuff about us.

34:09.920 --> 34:10.989
Xanden

34:11.000 --> 34:12.911
They flew off with Chris,

34:12.920 --> 34:14.114
they broke into our place

34:14.120 --> 34:15.917
and took that device.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.377
They are after us, man.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.075
Probably bugged
our apartment, too.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.116
-We should do a sweep.
-Yeah. Yes, definitely.

34:24.250 --> 34:27.162
Maybe... maybe...
Maybe we, um...

34:27.170 --> 34:30.492
Maybe we post that footage
from the deck, yeah?

34:30.500 --> 34:32.206
Blast it online, just
blow this whole thing up.

34:32.210 --> 34:33.609
It wasn't the military.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.917
What do you mean?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.911
It was me.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.909
I took it.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.371
You?

34:47.380 --> 34:48.916
-What the hell?
-Look, Xander,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.161
I thought I could figure out
what it was, you know.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.319
I thought it would
help Chris.

34:52.330 --> 34:53.957
That's bullshit!

34:53.960 --> 34:56.497
We should be helping each other,
not fighting each--

34:56.500 --> 34:57.489
Ooh!

34:57.500 --> 35:00.458
[scuffle continues]

35:00.460 --> 35:02.109
Come on!

35:02.120 --> 35:04.577
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get off him!

35:04.580 --> 35:05.956
Calvin, seriously.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.871
It's okay, everybody.

35:10.290 --> 35:11.780
I was trying to help.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.373
Look, if you want it,

35:16.380 --> 35:17.608
I'll go get it right now.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.949
Okay.

35:29.250 --> 35:30.820
We need to give it back.

35:30.830 --> 35:31.990
Why? What's happening?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.206
We don't need it anymore.

35:33.210 --> 35:36.247
Ryn, we need
to give it back, okay?

35:36.250 --> 35:37.535
No, no, no, no.

35:37.540 --> 35:39.246
We need to give this back.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.990
-Sister!
-This is not your sister.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.319
-Yes!
-Sister is not in here.

35:42.330 --> 35:44.992
-[grunts]
-We're gonna help you. Friends.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.615
[Ben]
Look, this is Xander.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.417
He can help
find your sister,

35:48.420 --> 35:50.320
but we need to give
this back to him.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.742
Friend, okay?

35:57.250 --> 35:59.616
Here, Xan. I'm sorry.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.668
Hey.

36:01.670 --> 36:05.959
I was thinking,
we should probably
work on the tracking.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.497
See if we can find
where the signal comes from.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.827
Yeah. Yeah,
okay, sure, we can try.

36:17.620 --> 36:18.609
What's up, Maddie?

36:18.620 --> 36:20.281
Hey, Xander.

36:20.290 --> 36:22.372
Who's this?

36:22.380 --> 36:25.702
Friend of mine from
the Marine Bio class
I'm taking.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.496
[Ben]
While you track that,

36:27.500 --> 36:30.071
I'll try to find out
more about the guy
who was on the boat.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.411
I can talk
to some of my colleagues

36:31.420 --> 36:33.285
who did some research
with the Naw,

36:33.290 --> 36:35.110
see if they know anything.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.247
We're gonna find him,
Xan.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.377
In the car.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.825
[heart monitor beeping]

37:24.620 --> 37:29.114
All right. Okay, so--
So we got Michael Eaton
at PRI.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.200
No, no.

37:30.210 --> 37:33.077
Uh, maybe Amanda Cullen

37:33.080 --> 37:35.537
or Professor Durbin
at U-Dub.

37:35.540 --> 37:37.531
We could just send
a few emails out,

37:37.540 --> 37:39.201
nothing suspicious.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.201
You know, just keep it
real subtle.

37:41.210 --> 37:43.326
How do you subtly ask
about a mermaid?

37:46.120 --> 37:48.247
We got to get you
back to Helen's.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.457
If you find your sister,
what would you do?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.747
Will you go home?

38:01.960 --> 38:05.248
I don't think
she understands.

38:06.670 --> 38:09.377
Ryn, if you
find your sister...

38:09.380 --> 38:10.608
Yes.

[high-pitched calls echoing]

39:45.000 --> 39:47.321
[thunder]

39:57.040 --> 39:59.167
She has a quality.

39:59.170 --> 40:01.035
It's hard to explain.
I don't know, like...

40:03.120 --> 40:05.702
Like I was drawn to her.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.611
Me, too.

40:11.620 --> 40:12.826
[door opens]

40:12.830 --> 40:14.320
[Dale]
So his neck was broken

40:14.330 --> 40:16.491
before he was thrown
through the window?

40:16.500 --> 40:17.876
-Rea|ly?
-[door closes]

40:19.620 --> 40:21.281
Mm-hmm.

40:21.290 --> 40:24.874
Well, you're gonna send
the report over, right?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.780
Non-human blood?

40:26.790 --> 40:31.033
What the heck
does that even mean?

40:31.040 --> 40:32.610
You mean like an animal
or something?

40:34.880 --> 40:37.826
No. Have-- Have Steve drop
it off at the house, all right?

40:41.880 --> 40:44.747
[Dale] All right.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.490
-I'll talk to you later.
-[phone beeps]

40:46.500 --> 40:48.741

40:51.670 --> 40:53.615
-Ben.
-Hey.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.918
Yeah. Everything's fine.

40:56.920 --> 41:00.117
Just a, uh, case
I'm working on.
