00:00.621 --> 00:02.922
That's so you'll never forget.

00:03.024 --> 00:04.456
I talked to my buddy about you.

00:04.559 --> 00:05.925
He wants to meet.

00:06.027 --> 00:06.959
So I'm in?

00:07.061 --> 00:08.260
Unless he hates you.

00:08.362 --> 00:10.129
I'm not going on a date with you.

00:13.167 --> 00:16.969
I'm Meredith Jones,
ATF field operations management,

00:17.071 --> 00:18.437
and this is our special agent.

00:18.539 --> 00:19.805
We met before?

00:19.907 --> 00:21.173
Koz says you might be
interested in working

00:21.275 --> 00:23.909
as a confidential informant.

00:24.011 --> 00:25.945
It just so happens that
Petersburg's in the middle

00:26.047 --> 00:29.148
of a biker war over drugs and territory.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.083
I'll need your help with
getting you patched.

00:31.185 --> 00:32.985
So go ahead, patch me in.

00:33.087 --> 00:34.520
For that I'm gonna
have to go back to LA.

00:34.622 --> 00:36.155
And I'll need you to come with me.

00:37.525 --> 00:40.492
Lucky! Lucky! Lucky! Lucky!

00:40.595 --> 00:42.595
<i>Why would anyone want to become a member</i>

00:42.697 --> 00:43.929
<i>of the Mongols?</i>

00:44.031 --> 00:45.497
<i>I mean, infiltrating the Vagos
was hard enough,</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:47.833
<i>but this club...</i>

00:47.935 --> 00:49.268
<i>there's something else.</i>

00:49.370 --> 00:51.503
Time to earn your patch, prospect.

00:53.374 --> 00:54.506
Get up, Lucky.

01:00.314 --> 01:02.181
Come on, Lucky.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.661
Come on, Lucky.

01:15.763 --> 01:17.529
<i>From the time they
started up in California</i>

01:17.632 --> 01:19.465
<i>back in '69, the price of admission</i>

01:19.567 --> 01:20.966

Come on, dude...

01:25.640 --> 01:27.406
<i>Somehow that only made membership</i>

01:27.508 --> 01:30.042
<i>all the more valuable.</i>

01:30.144 --> 01:31.911
<i>It didn't take long for
them to become one of</i>

01:32.013 --> 01:36.081
<i>the biggest outlaw

01:36.183 --> 01:38.384
<i>Trouble is, the more territory you take,</i>

01:38.486 --> 01:40.886
<i>the more enemies you make.</i>

01:59.040 --> 02:02.174
<i>The fact is,
when you put on a gang's patch</i>

02:02.276 --> 02:04.576
<i>you might as well paint
a target on your back</i>

02:04.679 --> 02:06.912
<i>'cause someone's always
got you in their sights.</i>

02:07.014 --> 02:09.615
Hey, Lucky?

02:09.717 --> 02:11.450
Be Lucky.

02:11.552 --> 02:13.619
<i>And even if they miss the first time,</i>

02:13.721 --> 02:16.522
<i>they can always find a
way to take another shot.</i>

03:14.515 --> 03:16.448
Decision time, Chef.

03:19.220 --> 03:20.319
What are you doing here?

03:20.421 --> 03:21.987
I left you two messages.

03:22.089 --> 03:25.124
I need to know what you're thinking.

03:31.632 --> 03:33.465
I dunno, you really need me
to go with you?

03:33.567 --> 03:35.467
It's a national Mongols run.

03:35.569 --> 03:36.769
If you're gonna get patched,
they're gonna wanna vet you

03:36.871 --> 03:38.670
in person.

03:38.773 --> 03:39.838
Yeah, I know,

03:39.940 --> 03:42.041
it's just the idea of
going back to LA...

03:42.143 --> 03:44.710
Don't worry. We got your back.

03:44.812 --> 03:46.111
<i>We?</i>

03:46.213 --> 03:47.679
Koz will be there too.

03:57.124 --> 03:57.956
Hey.

03:58.059 --> 03:59.191
You need a hand, Charlie?

03:59.293 --> 04:01.393
No, Mike, I need a couple days off.

04:01.495 --> 04:03.395
Next Friday and Monday.

04:03.497 --> 04:05.197
You know how busy we are, right?

04:05.299 --> 04:06.265
Yeah, it's a...

04:06.367 --> 04:08.816
it's a family emergency out west.

04:11.405 --> 04:13.001
I'll make it up to you, Mike.

04:15.409 --> 04:18.043
You being straight with me, Charlie?

04:18.144 --> 04:19.310
I saw your biker friend there.

04:19.413 --> 04:21.346
This have anything to do with him?

04:21.449 --> 04:24.583
No, Mike. My brother's sick.

04:24.685 --> 04:26.752
I'll tell 'em at church.

04:26.854 --> 04:28.821
We'll pray for him while you're there.

04:41.469 --> 04:42.768
Bullet?

04:48.275 --> 04:49.741
Hey.

04:49.844 --> 04:51.610
I texted I was coming.

04:51.712 --> 04:53.779
I was busy.

04:53.881 --> 04:55.747
Your flights, per diem and petty cash.

04:55.850 --> 04:56.782
I need you to sign for them.

04:56.884 --> 04:58.517
Got a pen?

05:00.955 --> 05:02.254
How do you live like this?

05:02.356 --> 05:03.755
I dunno. People drop by,

05:03.858 --> 05:05.424
I gotta keep up appearances.

05:05.526 --> 05:06.525
I hope it works out.

05:06.627 --> 05:08.260
It wasn't easy getting it approved.

05:08.362 --> 05:10.762
If we don't go,
we'll wind up treading water.

05:10.865 --> 05:12.197
They know that, right?

05:12.299 --> 05:13.599
Hey, it's budgets.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.601
They like to see expenses
line up with the results.

05:15.703 --> 05:19.738
Well, you tell 'em
I just gift-wrapped 'em a result.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.740
Okay, I will make sure your name's

05:21.842 --> 05:24.376
the only one on the card
when I brief them today.

05:24.478 --> 05:26.211
You know, I didn't mean it like that.

05:29.350 --> 05:30.649
You did good.

05:30.751 --> 05:32.618
Thanks.

05:33.821 --> 05:35.787
Hey...how's Charlie feeling?

05:35.890 --> 05:38.123
I was half expecting him to pull out.

05:51.405 --> 05:53.238
Well, what do we have here?

05:53.340 --> 05:55.340
Meredith, this is Crowbar.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.910
One of the guys that drops by.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.146
I'm running late. Nice to meet you.

06:01.248 --> 06:02.814
Nice to meet you.

06:02.917 --> 06:03.849
I'll call you later.

06:03.951 --> 06:05.817
Bye.

06:14.728 --> 06:18.597
Well, well, well,
Bullet likes 'em classy.

06:18.699 --> 06:20.332
Something I can do for you?

06:22.303 --> 06:24.336
Came to give you a heads-up.

06:24.438 --> 06:27.839
So, um, my gun guy, Paco,

06:27.942 --> 06:29.808
he's sittin' at home last night

06:29.910 --> 06:31.376
and he's just watching TV...

06:32.746 --> 06:35.347
Bam, they knock down his door.

06:35.449 --> 06:37.950
Fricken' ATF raid.

06:44.913 --> 06:45.857
They arrested him?

06:45.960 --> 06:47.693
Yeah.

06:47.795 --> 06:48.894
You know what that means.

06:48.996 --> 06:50.495
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no more guns.

06:50.598 --> 06:52.464
Don't worry about it.
I got another guy lined up.

06:52.566 --> 06:56.201
Screw the other guy. You don't get it?

06:56.303 --> 06:59.438
If they're watching Paco,
they're watching you.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.876
Me?

07:04.979 --> 07:08.380
And the first thing you do
is ride over here?

07:08.482 --> 07:09.848
Well, yeah.

07:09.950 --> 07:11.883
Yeah, I ride over here,
'cause I don't trust phones.

07:11.986 --> 07:14.486
Are you as stupid as you look?

07:15.956 --> 07:17.589
I don't need this, man.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.324
No, no, no, you came to me.

07:19.426 --> 07:21.493
You asked me to get you guns,
I hooked you up,

07:21.595 --> 07:22.928
you were a happy camper until what,

07:23.030 --> 07:26.265
a few seconds ago,
and now it's my fault?

07:26.367 --> 07:27.899
I did not come here to be disrespected!

07:28.002 --> 07:31.870
You disrespect me,
you disrespect the Pagans!

07:31.972 --> 07:33.338
Yeah.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.407
And you better be a whole
lot more worried about that

07:35.509 --> 07:38.610
than a few ATF agents
knockin' at your door.

07:40.014 --> 07:42.447
Get out of my way!

07:51.959 --> 07:52.991
Ooh, strong.

07:53.093 --> 07:55.093
- Watch.
- Okay.

07:58.499 --> 08:00.799
Man, you suck at bowling!

08:00.901 --> 08:02.534
Yeah.

08:02.636 --> 08:04.469
Add it to the list,
'cause I suck at walking too.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.937
I see that.

08:08.976 --> 08:10.876
Hey, I thought we agreed

08:10.978 --> 08:12.444
this is a friends-only non-date.

08:12.546 --> 08:13.645
Alright, then, why are you kissing me?

08:13.747 --> 08:15.347
You're the one that kissed me!

08:15.449 --> 08:17.082
I don't even like you.

08:21.555 --> 08:24.956
Woo! Yes!

08:28.028 --> 08:29.828
Straight home, right?

08:44.945 --> 08:48.380
What? What? What?

09:38.465 --> 09:39.798
What?

09:39.900 --> 09:41.533
Do you actually live here?

09:41.635 --> 09:42.968
As far as I know.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.503
This place has all the personality

09:44.605 --> 09:46.371
of a motel room.

09:46.473 --> 09:47.706
It came like this.

09:47.808 --> 09:49.541
What do you even do here?

09:49.643 --> 09:52.911
There's not a TV, no music, no books.

09:53.013 --> 09:55.914
You don't have coffee,
your cupboards are empty,

09:56.016 --> 09:57.916
you don't even have food in your fridge.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.885
I have a lot of thoughts.

10:01.789 --> 10:04.656
You are the man who wasn't there.

10:04.758 --> 10:06.057
You know what's great?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.694
Is waking up to someone
who really gets me.

10:19.173 --> 10:20.739
You know what you need?

10:20.841 --> 10:21.940
Bowling lessons.

10:22.042 --> 10:23.074
Yeah.

10:23.177 --> 10:24.743
You also need to get out more.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.746
Why don't you come over for dinner?

10:27.848 --> 10:30.048
I want you to meet my
friends Casey and Martha.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.583
Sure, anytime.

10:31.685 --> 10:32.951
This weekend?

10:33.053 --> 10:34.586
Except this weekend.

10:34.688 --> 10:36.421
Are you busy or something?

10:36.523 --> 10:38.089
I'm away.

10:38.192 --> 10:41.693
Away...

10:41.795 --> 10:43.695
Are you gonna make me ask you where?

10:44.998 --> 10:47.132
Back home? What's the occasion?

10:47.234 --> 10:48.767
Family stuff.

10:48.869 --> 10:50.602
Good or bad family stuff?

10:50.704 --> 10:52.437
Sarah Jane, do you ever

10:52.539 --> 10:55.607
think of a question and then not ask it?

10:55.709 --> 10:58.610
Why would I do that?

11:09.323 --> 11:13.658
Again, how do we know each other?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.627
Chef? You with me?

11:15.729 --> 11:17.929
Yeah...

11:18.031 --> 11:20.065
I got a question for you.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.901
Let's assume we,
we get the green-light

11:23.003 --> 11:26.671
and you become chapter
president and I get patched in.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.139
Then what?

11:28.242 --> 11:31.076
I'll tell you when you get patched.

11:31.178 --> 11:33.011
And how do we know each other?

11:33.452 --> 11:35.947
I sold you meth back in the day.

11:36.049 --> 11:37.782
Why can't you answer my question?

11:37.885 --> 11:39.985
Because there won't be any "then what,"

11:40.087 --> 11:42.220
if you screw up... Okay?

11:42.322 --> 11:46.091
There'll be you and me at the
bottom of a river somewhere.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.629
Last one, how do you know Ziggy?

11:55.731 --> 11:56.664
Who's Ziggy?

11:56.766 --> 11:57.798
Exactly. You don't know him.

11:57.900 --> 11:58.799
You never met him. Got it?

11:58.901 --> 12:00.100
Yeah.

12:00.202 --> 12:01.135
<i>So this is the crazy world of</i>

12:01.237 --> 12:03.437
<i>the Mongols' annual bike run.</i>

12:05.708 --> 12:06.941
<i>When I left California,</i>

12:07.043 --> 12:09.510
<i>I figured I'd never come back.</i>

12:09.612 --> 12:11.512
<i>But now I'm here, and I'm about to meet</i>

12:11.614 --> 12:13.847
<i>the one guy I never
expected to see again.</i>

12:13.950 --> 12:16.450
Ziggy.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.520
Bullet.

12:21.557 --> 12:23.123
Good to see you, buddy.

12:23.225 --> 12:24.358
Welcome home, brother!

12:24.460 --> 12:26.460
Long time.

12:26.562 --> 12:30.064
Tug, long time brother. What's up?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.666
Same ol' shit.

12:32.768 --> 12:34.034
So how's Stubby?

12:34.136 --> 12:36.036
Shipped out.

12:36.138 --> 12:37.538
Who's your new prospect?

12:37.640 --> 12:40.040
This is Chef. Old buddy of mine.

12:40.142 --> 12:41.875
Tug, national Sergeant at Arms.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.011
And the ugly one here, Ziggy,

12:44.113 --> 12:46.680
Pomona chapter Sergeant at Arms.

12:46.782 --> 12:48.749
It's a privilege, man.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.551
Prospect.

12:50.653 --> 12:54.054
You ask permission to shake
a patch-holder's hand.

12:54.156 --> 12:57.558
My bad. Permission to shake?

13:00.963 --> 13:03.564
Get us beers.

13:03.666 --> 13:06.192
Beer, prospect. Now.

13:12.641 --> 13:13.907
So you recruited him?

13:14.010 --> 13:15.075
Yeah.

13:15.177 --> 13:16.910
Stubby give him his prospect patch?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.912
No, I did.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.015
Stubby's chapter P.

13:21.117 --> 13:22.549
You don't have the authority.

13:22.651 --> 13:24.051
Yeah, well...

13:24.153 --> 13:27.421
I'll make sure I talk to Miles
about that when I see him.

13:27.523 --> 13:28.722
Is he around?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.758
Should be soon.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.526
What's happening out your way?

13:32.628 --> 13:33.894
Messed up any Maggots lately?

13:33.996 --> 13:35.529
It's a damn war zone.

13:35.631 --> 13:37.631
We gotta build there
if we're gonna last.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.967
You're patching with
guys you barely know,

13:40.069 --> 13:41.969
you'll wind up with snitches.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.937
Do we have a problem, Tug?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.673
The problem is Miles

13:46.776 --> 13:49.610
and his bullshit expansion plan.

13:52.214 --> 13:55.549
Prospect. Tell me something.

13:55.651 --> 13:56.950
You support Miles?

13:57.053 --> 13:59.586
What's the wrong answer?

13:59.688 --> 14:00.937
Sit down.

14:02.992 --> 14:04.792
What'd you say your name was again?

14:04.894 --> 14:05.793
Chef.

14:05.895 --> 14:06.960
Why Chef?

14:07.063 --> 14:08.896
Well, 'cause I used to cook meth.

14:08.998 --> 14:09.997
How you know Bullet?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.599
I used to sell it to him.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.001
When was this?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.769
Do I look like a prospect?

14:15.871 --> 14:17.541
Answer the question.

14:19.909 --> 14:22.076
Four, five years ago?

14:22.178 --> 14:23.177
Where?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.511
In The Valley.

14:24.613 --> 14:28.248
Yeah? I have a lab out there.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.751
What's your cooking process?

14:30.853 --> 14:32.152
Are you fricken' serious?

14:32.254 --> 14:34.988
It's a simple question.

14:35.091 --> 14:40.094
Ephedrine, Red P, lye, fire starter,

14:40.196 --> 14:41.829
you know, your basic shake n' bake.

14:41.931 --> 14:45.165
Garage crank.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.466
He calls himself 'Chef.'

14:49.271 --> 14:51.839
You know, nobody ever called me 'Chef'

14:51.941 --> 14:55.275
until I got a line on
some pure bulk precursors:

14:55.377 --> 14:59.646
ethyl, methylamine,
you know, the good stuff.

14:59.748 --> 15:01.548
Just took it to a whole next level.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.985
In fact, that's when I decided
to leave the retail crystal

15:05.087 --> 15:07.654
to the bottom-feeders in the Valley,

15:07.756 --> 15:09.957
and I got into wholesale liquid base.

15:10.059 --> 15:12.247
Bullet here was my biggest customer.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.031
Yeah, you remember that time
we got pulled over

15:18.134 --> 15:20.634
by that trooper?

15:20.736 --> 15:22.569
Yeah, yeah?

15:22.671 --> 15:25.239
True story. Bullet's fault.

15:25.341 --> 15:29.143
He's doing like 95 as
usual when we got radared.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.213
The cop takes one look
at us and he figures

15:33.315 --> 15:35.182
we're worth searching.

15:35.284 --> 15:38.752
Now,
we've got five gallons in the back seat.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.221
But the beauty of liquid meth is

15:41.323 --> 15:44.558
it's got this wholesome
amber liquid colour.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.059
Looks like apple juice.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.895
You can help yourself if you're thirsty,
officer.

15:47.997 --> 15:49.730
So it turns out there is nothing illegal

15:49.832 --> 15:51.331
about speeding with
a case of apple juice

15:51.433 --> 15:54.234
in the state of California.

15:54.336 --> 15:56.495
Except of course, the speeding part.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.273
You never told us about this business.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.076
Well, it was...
before my time in the club.

16:03.179 --> 16:07.781
So why'd you quit? You get busted?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.184
Nah. You know, the Feds,

16:10.286 --> 16:11.752
they,
they clamped down on the chemicals,

16:11.854 --> 16:14.021
the heat was on, so I couldn't go back

16:14.123 --> 16:16.590
to hustling garage crank, right?

16:16.692 --> 16:19.359
So I figured I'd get
out while I was ahead.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.265
There's a black Cross-bones
parked out there.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.701
Wash it for me.

16:27.803 --> 16:30.003
Sure.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.642
Who's up for a real drink?

16:35.744 --> 16:36.710
Let's do it.

16:36.812 --> 16:37.811
I'm heading outside.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.880
You can pick me up a bottle of whiskey.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.282
Just put it on my tab.

16:44.053 --> 16:45.652
Tug's thing with Miles...

16:45.754 --> 16:47.788
Has he got support?

16:47.890 --> 16:48.822
With the old guard.

16:48.924 --> 16:49.890
If it goes to a vote this weekend,

16:49.992 --> 16:52.659
either him or Miles will be out bad.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.661
If it's Miles, I am screwed.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.097
...a lot of weekend left.

16:57.199 --> 17:00.067
Bottle of whiskey, three glasses.

17:04.205 --> 17:07.107
Guess what, Prospect?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.281
Year the Mongols were formed?

17:15.384 --> 17:17.117
1969.

17:17.219 --> 17:18.285
What month?

17:18.387 --> 17:20.354
Come on, man, seriously?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.990
July.

17:23.092 --> 17:27.194
Two more, drink 'em down.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.176
Yeah!

17:38.274 --> 17:39.940
Here you go.

17:44.446 --> 17:47.014
What's goin' on?

17:47.116 --> 17:50.050
History test.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.319
The Mongols'
mother chapter is from where?

17:52.421 --> 17:53.720
Montecito.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.189
Ooh!

17:56.292 --> 17:58.158
Montebello.

17:58.260 --> 17:59.226
That's what I meant.

18:01.095 --> 18:03.230
Three more.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.371
'Atta boy.

18:11.473 --> 18:13.707
'Atta boy, come on.

18:13.809 --> 18:15.619
Whoa-ho-ho!

18:22.964 --> 18:24.818
Yeah!

18:24.920 --> 18:26.753
Okay, point made, Tug.

18:26.855 --> 18:27.988
Chef, you alright?

18:28.090 --> 18:30.724
He ain't done.

18:30.826 --> 18:32.612
C'mon, man.

18:37.499 --> 18:40.500
Prospect, a patch-holder
ordered you to drink.

18:40.602 --> 18:42.836
Now drink.

18:42.938 --> 18:46.740
Drink! Drink! Drink!

19:05.894 --> 19:07.761
Okay, enough.

19:07.863 --> 19:09.896
Alright. Chef, come on.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.933
Chef, let's go.

19:13.035 --> 19:14.935
He's not done.

19:15.037 --> 19:17.771
I say he is.

19:17.873 --> 19:18.772
Tug...

19:18.874 --> 19:20.273
Who gives a about this prospect?

19:20.376 --> 19:22.776
Let's have a drink.

19:22.878 --> 19:24.244
Everyone enjoying the party?

19:24.346 --> 19:26.413
Hey, Miles. What's up brother?

19:30.219 --> 19:32.152
There a problem here, Tug?

19:32.254 --> 19:33.387
Besides him?

19:33.489 --> 19:34.886
Just doin' my job.

19:36.058 --> 19:37.958
Someone has to keep this
club's standards up.

19:38.060 --> 19:39.326
This your prospect?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.128
Tug's been on him.

19:41.230 --> 19:42.996
Listen, I was hoping
we'd get a chance to talk?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.898
Hey, relax, Bullet.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.300
We got all weekend, brother.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.902
Hey...

19:55.489 --> 19:56.824
Drink up.

19:56.825 --> 19:58.685
I want you sharp by tonight.

20:03.432 --> 20:06.133
How's the head, Chef?

20:06.235 --> 20:08.769
You still in role, Ziggy?

20:08.871 --> 20:11.371
Come on. Charlie, you're a prospect.

20:11.473 --> 20:14.174
You know how this works.

20:14.276 --> 20:16.810
I don't know anything.

20:16.912 --> 20:18.712
In fact, I didn't know you
were working the Mongols

20:18.814 --> 20:21.114
for the last four years
until Bullet told me.

20:21.216 --> 20:22.149
Well, you think I could risk

20:22.251 --> 20:25.218
telling a CI facing charges?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.887
I thought we were friends.

20:26.989 --> 20:29.055
Call 911, I think you hurt his feelings.

20:29.158 --> 20:30.390
Is that really necessary? Come on.

20:30.492 --> 20:32.292
Hang on, hang on. We are friends.

20:32.394 --> 20:34.194
<i>We are friends.</i>

20:34.296 --> 20:36.897
Well, you didn't let me
see the whole board.

20:36.999 --> 20:40.033
So I don't really know what's coming.

20:40.135 --> 20:43.370
You know, I still have
nightmares about the Vagos.

20:46.141 --> 20:51.311
Sometimes I think Darko's
out and he's stalking me.

20:52.581 --> 20:54.848
What?

20:54.950 --> 20:57.050
Darko cut a deal.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.053
What, he's out? You didn't warn me?

21:00.155 --> 21:02.389
He is on the world's shortest leash,

21:02.491 --> 21:04.825
so you don't have to worry.
You're completely safe.

21:04.927 --> 21:07.060
I'm safe? Yeah.

21:07.162 --> 21:09.729
I'm safe with you two?

21:09.832 --> 21:12.933
What's up for tonight,
you gonna hold me down

21:13.035 --> 21:17.003
while Tug makes me drink brake fluid?

21:17.105 --> 21:19.139
No, tonight Miles is meeting
all the chapter heads.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.273
Which means you need to make your case

21:20.375 --> 21:21.441
before Tug gets to him.

21:21.543 --> 21:23.743
And you need to make
a better impression.

21:23.846 --> 21:25.078
Did I even meet him?

21:25.642 --> 21:26.413
Shit.

21:26.515 --> 21:28.748
Here.

21:37.025 --> 21:39.226
I don't even know why this is a problem.

21:39.328 --> 21:40.861
We wanna be Mongols Nation?

21:40.963 --> 21:44.064
We gotta be national,
coast to coast, 50 states.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.265
Wanna beat the Maggots?

21:45.367 --> 21:47.033
We gotta be bigger than the Maggots.

21:47.135 --> 21:49.536
Not everyone sees it that way.

21:49.638 --> 21:51.905
You know Tug's problem?

21:52.007 --> 21:55.876
He's a soldier who thinks he's a leader.

21:55.978 --> 21:58.178
Here comes a man on a mission.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
Just wanna make sure we
get a chance to talk.

22:03.986 --> 22:05.848
Yeah... Have a seat.

22:10.492 --> 22:13.927
Miles, I wanted you to meet Chef.

22:14.029 --> 22:15.795
He wasn't at his best last night.

22:15.898 --> 22:17.797
But he's a solid prospect.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.133
I'm also looking at
some solid hang-arounds,

22:20.235 --> 22:21.935
but I got a problem.

22:22.037 --> 22:23.303
Bullet.

22:23.405 --> 22:25.071
My guy's been on the door all night.

22:25.173 --> 22:28.375
It's time that your
prospect here took over.

22:32.581 --> 22:35.849
You got a problem, let's hear it.

22:38.487 --> 22:41.021
Sergeant-at-arms can hear it too.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.994
Okay. I'm stalling without Stubby.

22:48.096 --> 22:49.496
Without Stubby,

22:49.598 --> 22:53.033
your prospect ain't
even a real prospect.

22:53.135 --> 22:54.601
You make my point for me.

22:54.703 --> 22:56.002
I need you to make me chapter P

22:56.104 --> 22:57.270
so I can build up our club.

22:57.372 --> 22:59.606
You're asking our
international president

22:59.708 --> 23:02.008
to screw over your chapter president?

23:02.110 --> 23:02.943
No.

23:03.045 --> 23:05.178
I'm asking for my own chapter.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.148
And when Stubby gets back,
he gets half my new recruits.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.316
And then once you've gotten Virginia

23:09.418 --> 23:10.984
that's two chapters instead of one.

23:11.086 --> 23:12.218
Full of guys nobody knows.

23:12.321 --> 23:15.555
Full of Mongol brothers.

23:25.634 --> 23:27.875
Come on, seriously?

23:30.005 --> 23:32.238
Sorry guys. Private party.

23:32.341 --> 23:33.506
You know who I am?

23:33.609 --> 23:35.375
No, they didn't give me a guest list.

23:35.477 --> 23:36.977
That's your problem, Holmes.

23:37.079 --> 23:37.911
I'm expected.

23:38.013 --> 23:39.045
Yeah, I don't think so.

23:39.147 --> 23:40.480
Hey...

23:42.317 --> 23:45.385
Hector. Hey man, wassup?

23:45.487 --> 23:47.253
Bitch thinks he's at the Oscars.

23:47.356 --> 23:49.343
Yeah? Let him in, dickweed.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.927
Problem with these new guys,

23:53.996 --> 23:56.162
they don't know who our friends are.

24:01.336 --> 24:02.502
What's the verdict from Miles?

24:02.604 --> 24:04.971
Didn't get one yet.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.126
Let's see it.

24:26.228 --> 24:28.194
You bring all the cash?

24:36.405 --> 24:37.804
That's it?

24:37.906 --> 24:40.106
I drive 40 minutes,
you give me half what you already owe?

24:40.208 --> 24:41.274
Come on, Hector,

24:41.343 --> 24:43.276
I'll get you back the end of the week.

24:43.378 --> 24:45.478
What are we, the pizza guys?

24:45.547 --> 24:48.548
We look like we take Visa to you?

24:48.650 --> 24:49.949
What's up, boys?

24:50.052 --> 24:51.284
What's up?

24:51.386 --> 24:52.385
Your brother wants
something he can't afford.

24:52.487 --> 24:54.254
That's wassup.

24:54.356 --> 24:56.389
- Didn't you pay him?
- Yeah.

24:56.491 --> 24:57.657
Then what's the problem?

24:57.759 --> 25:02.562
He wants new product but
he still owes me six grand.

25:02.664 --> 25:07.634
The boss don't know? Is it his cash?

25:07.736 --> 25:11.171
You fat fool, you are so busted.

25:11.273 --> 25:12.972
Hector.

25:13.075 --> 25:15.475
You laughin' at my brother?

25:15.577 --> 25:18.745
In front of me??

25:54.316 --> 25:56.282
Stay away from me!

26:00.122 --> 26:01.221
Dickweed!

26:14.783 --> 26:16.382
Just to confirm,

26:16.484 --> 26:18.551
we got nothing tomorrow morning, right?

26:18.653 --> 26:22.055
Only thing left is a meeting at Miles'
place tomorrow night.

26:22.157 --> 26:23.356
Alright.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.258
Don't wake me up until afternoon, okay?

26:39.841 --> 26:43.276
Hello?

26:43.378 --> 26:44.844
Hey.

26:44.946 --> 26:47.413
Do you have any idea what time it is?

26:47.515 --> 26:50.249
7:19.

26:50.352 --> 26:51.617
What's that in hippie time?

26:51.720 --> 26:56.255
That's like... 19 minutes past 4.

26:56.866 --> 26:57.790
Ouch.

26:57.892 --> 26:59.425
Surprised you're already up.

26:59.527 --> 27:00.827
Yeah, well, you know I just like to

27:00.929 --> 27:03.196
get a jump on the day.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.267
You okay, Charlie?

27:08.370 --> 27:12.138
Yeah... I'm just lying here,

27:12.240 --> 27:15.241
wondering why I make my life so hard.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.276
Is everything okay with your family?

27:17.379 --> 27:19.112
My family?

27:19.214 --> 27:21.547
The reason you're there?

27:21.649 --> 27:23.282
Yeah.

27:23.385 --> 27:27.620
My brother was sick, and um,
now he's on the mend.

27:27.722 --> 27:29.889
Well, that's good to hear.

27:32.927 --> 27:34.627
Can I tell you something?

27:34.729 --> 27:36.627
You mean voluntarily?

27:38.833 --> 27:41.651
I've made a real mess of my life.

27:43.371 --> 27:47.306
And being back here,
it's just all questions,

27:47.409 --> 27:51.778
and stories,
and just questions about the past.

27:54.416 --> 27:56.649
And all I want to do is look forward.

27:56.751 --> 27:59.152
So look forward.

27:59.254 --> 28:01.654
I'm trying.

28:01.756 --> 28:04.424
But I can't see anything.

28:04.526 --> 28:07.527
Really? Nothing at all?

28:07.629 --> 28:11.664
Well... maybe one thing.

28:11.766 --> 28:13.466
What's that?

28:13.568 --> 28:16.669
There's this pretty
little waitress I know.

28:16.771 --> 28:18.337
That's some sweet talk for a guy

28:18.440 --> 28:19.872
I'm not actually dating.

28:19.974 --> 28:21.930
What if you actually were?

28:23.845 --> 28:25.878
I gotta go.

28:35.490 --> 28:38.057
Okay, party o'clock, let's do this.

28:40.328 --> 28:42.728
So it's actually more of
a meeting than a party.

28:42.831 --> 28:44.664
It's ranking officers only.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.232
Yeah? So why are we going?

28:46.334 --> 28:48.367
Miles is going to make it official.

28:48.470 --> 28:49.635
Really?

28:50.939 --> 28:53.039
Cool.

28:54.309 --> 28:55.735
Hey, Miles.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.912
Yep... Yeah.

29:00.982 --> 29:02.548
What's wrong?

29:02.650 --> 29:05.351
Miles wants us to pick up Tug.

29:24.506 --> 29:26.772
Close that. It's cold back here.

29:26.875 --> 29:29.575
They're gonna charge me
extra for the smell.

29:29.677 --> 29:31.344
Turn left up there.

29:31.446 --> 29:32.512
The freeway's right.

29:32.614 --> 29:34.247
Turn left.

29:34.349 --> 29:36.549
And close that window.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.852
Pull in there.

29:39.954 --> 29:41.254
Something wrong?

29:41.356 --> 29:44.690
Yeah. I'm hungry.

29:49.564 --> 29:50.830
I can drive while you eat.

29:50.932 --> 29:53.766
Nah, you sit tight.

29:59.874 --> 30:05.044
Yeah... Yeah...

30:05.146 --> 30:08.863
Yeah... Yeah...

30:10.856 --> 30:12.024
Yeah...

30:13.988 --> 30:17.721
Yeah. Yeah.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.731
Okay... Let's go.

30:37.278 --> 30:38.825
Go left.

30:39.175 --> 30:40.936
What about Miles' place?

30:41.549 --> 30:43.516
Change of plan.

30:53.661 --> 30:55.928
Tug, you wanna tell me
where we're going?

30:56.030 --> 30:57.863
It's up ahead.

31:07.041 --> 31:09.875
Park there.

31:14.716 --> 31:17.883
Okay, enough, why are we...

31:17.985 --> 31:19.985
Out you get.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.144
Keep going.

31:45.246 --> 31:47.113
Go on.

31:49.617 --> 31:50.916
Sit down.

32:00.094 --> 32:01.694
You know why we're here?

32:01.796 --> 32:03.162
If this is about your feud with Miles,

32:03.264 --> 32:05.998
it's got nothing to do with us.

32:13.775 --> 32:16.976
Right now it's all about you.

32:17.078 --> 32:19.612
Miles? What is this?

32:19.714 --> 32:21.847
Me and Tug got our differences.

32:21.949 --> 32:23.849
But he brought something to my attention

32:23.951 --> 32:25.985
that I just can't ignore.

32:26.087 --> 32:27.286
What's that?

32:27.388 --> 32:31.023
We have a few questions for Chef.

32:31.125 --> 32:32.627
What do you want to know?

32:34.362 --> 32:35.814
You ever heard of the Vagos?

32:41.869 --> 32:43.679
The biker club? Sure.

32:50.178 --> 32:52.978
You know any Vagos?

32:53.080 --> 32:54.747
Nope.

32:54.849 --> 32:56.271
You sure about that?

32:58.953 --> 33:01.654
Yeah.

33:01.756 --> 33:04.557
How about a Vago named Quick?

33:04.659 --> 33:07.927
Also known as Charles Falco.

33:12.846 --> 33:15.047
Are you accusing Chef with something?

33:15.149 --> 33:17.182
You lie down with dogs

33:17.284 --> 33:20.185
and you wake up with fleas, brother.

33:20.287 --> 33:21.753
What's your real name, Chef?

33:21.855 --> 33:23.088
Conner.

33:23.190 --> 33:24.890
Conner?

33:24.992 --> 33:25.958
Is that a first name, last name?

33:26.060 --> 33:27.259
What is that?

33:27.361 --> 33:29.061
Last name.

33:29.163 --> 33:31.763
What's your first name?

33:31.865 --> 33:33.124
Charlie.

33:36.203 --> 33:39.104
Well, Charlie...

33:39.206 --> 33:40.806
Tug here has found something

33:40.908 --> 33:43.775
that he wants you to have a look at.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.715
Do you know the most important thing

33:49.817 --> 33:52.266
that I do for this club, Charlie?

33:53.854 --> 33:55.787
Homework.

33:55.889 --> 34:00.292
See, strength is not always about size.

34:00.394 --> 34:02.961
It's about knowing who your friends are,

34:03.063 --> 34:05.063
and your enemies.

34:05.165 --> 34:08.766
See, when a club like the
Vagos goes down in a raid,

34:08.869 --> 34:11.235
I read all about that.

34:11.338 --> 34:14.139
You wanna know why?

34:14.241 --> 34:17.775
That's when brothers start
looking for other clubs to join.

34:17.878 --> 34:21.647
And sometimes those brothers
turn out to be people

34:21.748 --> 34:24.815
that are just like you.

34:24.918 --> 34:27.112
See anyone you know there, Charlie?

34:30.757 --> 34:33.190
No.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.127
Which one is supposed to be me?

34:35.228 --> 34:37.029
The one who looks just like you.

34:37.130 --> 34:42.011
Charlie Falco. The ATF snitch.

34:43.469 --> 34:44.670
Let me see.

34:48.998 --> 34:51.208
Shit. Where'd you get this?

34:51.311 --> 34:53.844
The biker's rights newsletter.

34:53.947 --> 34:55.884
They flag the snitches.

35:02.389 --> 35:04.456
Guy's a ringer on the
cheeks and the nose,

35:04.558 --> 35:06.692
but can't tell for the eyes.

35:06.794 --> 35:09.127
This guy's in shades. I don't know.

35:09.229 --> 35:13.331
Hair's different, body,
chin, hard to say...

35:13.434 --> 35:15.033
Lots of people look like someone else.

35:15.135 --> 35:17.002
I'm telling you it's him.

35:17.104 --> 35:19.259
What about this one? He looks like you.

35:25.813 --> 35:29.014
You think I look as stupid
as this guy in the picture?

35:29.116 --> 35:31.349
Look man, only a moron
would snitch on the Vagos

35:31.452 --> 35:32.984
and then snitch on the Mongols.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.219
You shut up, Falco.

35:34.321 --> 35:35.598
It's Conner.

35:37.458 --> 35:40.726
Easy, if you wanna see
a good picture of me,

35:40.828 --> 35:44.930
all you gotta do is take
a look at my license.

35:45.966 --> 35:48.100
Pssht... Proves nothing.

35:48.202 --> 35:50.836
Look, I've known Charlie four years.

35:50.938 --> 35:52.938
All this picture proves
is that anybody can see

35:53.040 --> 35:54.239
what they want to see.

35:54.341 --> 35:55.874
Are you guys really going
to kill two brothers

35:55.976 --> 35:57.651
on the strength of this?

36:06.587 --> 36:09.221
Yeah, not tonight, Tug.

36:14.428 --> 36:16.962
Bike's outside. Let's go.

36:29.233 --> 36:31.833
This is bullshit,
and I'm gonna prove it.

36:31.935 --> 36:34.136
What are you gonna do?
Stop Miles from expanding the club?

36:34.238 --> 36:36.138
You want a club full of snitches?

36:36.240 --> 36:37.706
Then you follow Miles.

36:37.808 --> 36:40.108
You want brothers you can trust?

36:40.210 --> 36:41.510
Then you follow me.

36:41.612 --> 36:42.811
I would, man,
but you know what your problem is?

36:42.913 --> 36:43.979
You make too many enemies.

36:44.081 --> 36:45.247
Yeah?

36:45.349 --> 36:48.116
Well, a real man
can't have too many enemies.

36:55.959 --> 36:57.392
When you boys fly out?

36:57.494 --> 37:00.128
Red-eye, tomorrow night.

37:00.230 --> 37:02.030
You're hoping for word
on your chapter by then.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.198
Yep.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.067
Whatever you think about Tug,

37:05.169 --> 37:07.969
he makes a point a lot of guys agree on

37:08.072 --> 37:10.172
about expansion.

37:10.274 --> 37:13.375
Politics is all about timing.

37:13.477 --> 37:14.976
You're saying no?

37:15.079 --> 37:16.833
Until the time's right.

37:20.517 --> 37:22.551
Happy trails, Chef.

37:43.507 --> 37:46.441
Tug! Tug, Tug!

38:03.642 --> 38:04.441
You okay?

38:04.543 --> 38:05.290
Stay sharp.

38:05.290 --> 38:06.943
If anything happens
it'll be between here

38:07.045 --> 38:09.245
and the cemetery.

38:32.037 --> 38:33.603
Died a soldier?

38:33.705 --> 38:35.629
Tell me again what you saw.

38:37.709 --> 38:40.410
It was dark. Car came up from behind.

38:40.512 --> 38:43.446
It happened pretty fast,
but I'm pretty sure it was the Surenos.

38:43.548 --> 38:45.515
Hector.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.305
But you can't be sure, right?

38:50.155 --> 38:51.621
Anyone else see it?

38:51.723 --> 38:53.289
No, it was just us. Why?

38:53.391 --> 38:55.959
Guys all have their theories.

38:56.061 --> 39:00.130
Just wanna make sure they
know who's really responsible.

39:00.232 --> 39:02.132
See you at the cemetery.

39:02.234 --> 39:04.805
Hey, Bullet? You got a sec?

39:17.349 --> 39:18.982
Hardest thing about being president

39:19.084 --> 39:20.517
of this club is this:

39:20.619 --> 39:23.453
when we send a brother
on his final ride.

39:23.555 --> 39:25.655
Tug wasn't the first to die in battle

39:25.757 --> 39:27.991
and he won't be the last.

39:28.093 --> 39:32.262
But as his brothers,
it's important that we honour him

39:32.364 --> 39:35.198
and remember him, and above all,

39:35.300 --> 39:39.302
make sure he didn't die in vain.

39:39.404 --> 39:42.338
There's a rumour that
Tug's killers were Surenos.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.208
I got the truth from Ziggy.

39:45.310 --> 39:48.852
Tug's killers were Maggots.

39:50.448 --> 39:54.450
Tug believed our strength wasn't
with the size of the club;

39:54.553 --> 39:57.187
it was knowing our enemies.

39:57.289 --> 39:59.155
Well, we know our oldest enemy,

39:59.257 --> 40:02.725
and we know there's one thing
we can do to win this war:

40:02.827 --> 40:07.497
get bigger, get stronger,

40:07.599 --> 40:10.633
and take this war to them.

40:10.735 --> 40:12.035
You with me, brothers?

40:12.137 --> 40:13.169
Yeah.

40:13.271 --> 40:14.204
Are you with me?

40:14.306 --> 40:16.539
Yeah!

40:21.313 --> 40:23.227
Have a drink on me, Tug.

40:34.693 --> 40:37.760
We got a plane to catch.

40:44.169 --> 40:45.335
See what he did there?

40:45.437 --> 40:46.603
If we don't put him in prison soon,

40:46.705 --> 40:49.606
it's gonna be worse than it sounds.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.242
I did not see that coming.

40:52.344 --> 40:53.276
We're gonna have our work cut out.

40:53.378 --> 40:54.444
Yeah.

40:54.546 --> 40:56.246
You gonna stick with us, Charlie?

40:56.348 --> 40:57.513
Depends.

40:57.616 --> 41:00.283
You gonna interrogate me
on blood plastic again?

41:00.385 --> 41:01.551
I don't know.

41:01.653 --> 41:03.253
That was some of your best work.

41:03.355 --> 41:04.954
You think?

41:09.527 --> 41:11.761
Welcome to the club, brother.

41:18.837 --> 41:21.571
Hey, Charlie...

41:21.673 --> 41:23.706
Be lucky.

41:32.350 --> 41:33.650
Remember when I asked you what's next

41:33.752 --> 41:35.752
if we get what we came for?

41:35.854 --> 41:37.620
Sure.

41:37.722 --> 41:38.821
Well, we got what we came for...

41:38.923 --> 41:40.480
What's next?

41:43.561 --> 41:45.795
We go home.
