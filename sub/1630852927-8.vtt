WEBVTT

00:12.429 --> 00:13.471
A vegetative state?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.932
Are you sure?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.351
Our assistant went
to the hospital in person.

00:19.102 --> 00:19.936
I'm sure.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.564
Then what about my daughter?

00:23.273 --> 00:26.067
What if the blame gets shifted to us?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.485
To be honest,

00:28.570 --> 00:31.573
his physical condition
won't affect anything.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.908
It's still a protection case,

00:33.992 --> 00:37.162
and the one who drove the car
is Kwak Do-seok, not them.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.997
The problem is the abetting charge.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.710
But there's a way to get around it,
so you don't need to worry.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.964
Then what should we do first?

00:49.048 --> 00:52.051
Start by keeping the children in check.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.649
<i>It's New Year's Day.</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.401
I'd like to give you a New Year's bow.

01:09.527 --> 01:10.695
Happy New Year.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.030
Hey, Do-seok. Hey.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.949
Okay.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.203
Thank you.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.080
Sit down.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.831
All right. Happy New Year.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.625
Yes. And I picked this up

01:25.335 --> 01:26.753
on the way here.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.839
You said you use pencils at work,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.299
so I got this for you.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.093
I picked it out myself.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.775
Thanks.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.444
I'll make good use of them.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.071
Okay.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.865
It's a promise then.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.992
You won't stand on trial again.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.452
Yes.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.499
I'll make sure that won't happen again.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.190
<i>I really didn't know anything.</i>

03:52.273 --> 03:54.567
<i>He just told me to get in the car,
so I did.</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:56.653
<i>If he tells us to do something,
we have to do it.</i>

03:59.197 --> 04:01.407
<i>They're all lying.</i>

04:01.491 --> 04:05.036
<i>They would call him out
in the middle of the night.</i>

04:05.620 --> 04:08.665
I tried reasoning with them,
scolding them,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.500
but they kept coming to our house.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.461
<i>Do-seok rented the car?</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:18.758
<i>He was driving? He probably did.
So he wouldn't get beaten.</i>

05:09.100 --> 05:11.019
Isn't the new presiding judge
coming today?

05:11.102 --> 05:12.103
Yes.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.855
One of my colleagues told me

05:13.938 --> 05:16.316
that she came here last night.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.943
She took a look around the court

05:19.027 --> 05:20.361
and looked over some records.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.904
I see.

05:21.988 --> 05:22.822
Ms. Joo.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.866
-Yes?
-Have you heard anything about her?

05:24.949 --> 05:27.535
Like her personality or idiosyncrasies.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.621
-I have.
-What is it?

05:30.705 --> 05:33.624
I've heard she's a tough cookie.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.709
I see.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.344
Let's be democratic about it.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.181
I'm not that strict.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.100
You can have lunch on your own,

05:51.684 --> 05:55.396
and you don't have to come to my office
to me when you're clocking in or out.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.565
That's annoying for me, too.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.028
What about the days
for individual and collegiate trials

06:03.071 --> 06:04.572
and the submission of rulings--

06:04.655 --> 06:06.199
As you're used to.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.035
Is there anything else?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.537
No, for now.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.166
If anything new comes up,
we can decide it then.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.711
Then let's wrap up this meeting.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.177
There is one thing that gets on my nerves.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.222
I can put up with dumb associate judges,

06:29.972 --> 06:31.766
but not with arrogant ones.

06:36.687 --> 06:40.149
Think about it. I'm the presiding judge.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.693
There's a clear line between us.
Don't you agree?

06:44.153 --> 06:46.864
Especially you. You better be careful.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.617
I've heard a lot about you.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.745
Yes, ma'am.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.415
Let's try to get along.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.597
I think I got on her bad side.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.268
Well, I can't do anything about it.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.854
Judge Sim. So I was wondering--

07:17.937 --> 07:20.106
-No.
-You don't know what I'm going to say.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.608
You're trying to interfere in the case.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.610
The underage traffic accident case.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.615
I know you feel bad about Kwak Do-seok.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.951
But that's where it ends.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.496
I hate to repeat myself.
Don't cross the line.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.299
Is this Kwak Do-seok's probation officer?

07:46.382 --> 07:49.510
I had some questions
while going through his records.

07:49.594 --> 07:54.849
He answered your calls
diligently at first.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.603
But after a month or two,
he started skipping lectures

07:58.686 --> 08:00.521
and even ignored your calls.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.648
What's the reason?

08:03.566 --> 08:07.904
<i>We made a few house visits
and met his mom because of that.</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:12.200
<i>What other reason is there?
He just got lazy and didn't want to.</i>

08:13.409 --> 08:17.163
<i>In his case,
his mother is his only guardian,</i>

08:17.246 --> 08:19.790
<i>but she's too busy making a living.</i>

08:19.874 --> 08:23.878
<i>But that doesn't mean
we can just dwell on him for so long.</i>

08:25.630 --> 08:29.258
There was a claim
that he was harassed for a long time.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.010
<i>That was from his mother, right?</i>

08:32.345 --> 08:37.058
<i>You probably already know this, but he's a
Taekwondo blackbelt and over 180cm.</i>

08:37.141 --> 08:40.269
<i>His past offenses are for
assault and extortion,</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:42.480
<i>so I don't really believe her.</i>

08:43.481 --> 08:45.858
AUTO BROTHERS

08:53.324 --> 08:56.869
That was months ago and
I already told the detectives everything.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.204
Yes, I know.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.209
But the minor who was driving at the time

09:04.335 --> 09:06.504
will be hospitalized for a long time.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.676
I'm sorry, but can I meet
the employee who was in charge then?

09:11.759 --> 09:13.719
Jeez, I don't know.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.556
She was assigned
to another branch last month.

09:17.265 --> 09:22.687
Then can I get her contact information
or which branch she was assigned to?

09:23.896 --> 09:28.276
<i>Working this job, I've seen lots of kids
turn themselves around and get better.</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:30.778
<i>But there are also
a lot of kids that don't.</i>

09:39.537 --> 09:40.746
You asked for me, Judge Sim?

09:40.830 --> 09:44.542
Kwak Do-seok
won't be sentenced in this case.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.296
So please summon all the other children
to attend the next trial.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.505
And for that trial,

09:49.589 --> 09:52.383
have their guardians
and attorneys wait outside.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.801
Yes, ma'am.

09:53.884 --> 09:54.844
And…

09:55.511 --> 09:58.639
when you have time,
please check their social media

09:58.723 --> 10:00.600
to see if there's anything problematic.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.393
Yes, ma'am.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.187
SECOND CRIME, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY

10:13.195 --> 10:15.573
Can't you take better care
of your fellow judge?

10:16.365 --> 10:20.661
Who's in charge of
the underage traffic accident case?

10:21.871 --> 10:22.747
It's me.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.665
If he's not in charge,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.668
why is he going to the rental shop
and poking around there?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.046
The Civil Service Office is in chaos.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.465
The store called and threw a fit.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.801
That it happened months ago
and they suffered serious losses over it.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.096
I got a call from the senior
presiding judge. This is ridiculous!

10:40.723 --> 10:42.850
Tell him to come to my office now.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.311
I'll handle it myself…

10:49.023 --> 10:50.483
and warn him properly.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.446
You better do it right.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.718
What were you thinking?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.139
I specifically told you to stop

11:22.223 --> 11:23.474
and not to cross the line.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.642
Are you really

11:26.477 --> 11:28.020
going to end it like this?

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
What?

11:29.855 --> 11:32.066
Mr. Seo told me everything.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.153
That Do-seok's mother filed a petition.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.950
And that she feels wronged.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.701
That's why I had to look into it.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.704
-This isn't your case!
-There was one more person.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.839
When Kwak Do-seok was there
to rent the car,

11:56.173 --> 11:57.800
he was with someone.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.136
Hey, wait.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.057
-Hye-jeong!
-Yes?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.441
Hello, do you already have a booking?

12:14.191 --> 12:15.443
Well, no.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.069
Have a seat here.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.696
Okay.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.450
When the police were investigating,

12:22.533 --> 12:25.202
she was startled
that she forgot about the girl.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.831
She went to the police later, but the case
was already sent to the prosecution.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.919
It was from a distance,
so she wasn't sure.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.967
But she thinks
it was one of the girls riding the car.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.061
She may be the key to this case.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.605
We need to look into it further.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.942
Judge Sim!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.656
I said Kwak Do-seok
wouldn't be prosecuted,

13:03.407 --> 13:07.203
not that I'd half-ass this case.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.123
His guardian filed a petition,

13:11.207 --> 13:13.334
and since I have knowledge of that,

13:13.417 --> 13:16.587
I need to find out
what exactly happened at the time

13:17.630 --> 13:19.340
and who's accountable for what.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.384
Finding out the truth comes first.

13:23.302 --> 13:27.348
And following the proper procedures
is also a judge's duty.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.392
You don't have to
go around poking everywhere.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.397
I'm also doing my best

13:36.315 --> 13:37.650
as the judge in charge.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.991
Okay, ma'am.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.375
<i>Hello, Judge Sim. This is Seo Beom.</i>

13:54.458 --> 13:55.543
What is it?

13:55.626 --> 13:58.337
I checked their social media
as you requested.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.214
Their attorney must have told them to.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.967
All their photos and videos
have been deleted.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.177
<i>Their accounts have been
completely deleted.</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:07.596
<i>All their other accounts
have been as well.</i>

14:08.889 --> 14:10.891
What should we do now?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.771
<i>There was one more person.</i>

14:15.854 --> 14:18.983
When Kwak Do-seok
was there to rent the car,

14:20.192 --> 14:21.860
he was with someone.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.364
<i>She may be the key to this case.</i>

14:25.447 --> 14:27.074
<i>We need to look into it further.</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:40.087
All of them had alibis
for when the car was rented.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.965
Lee Nam-gyeong and Kang Tae-hun
were at an Internet cafe,

14:43.048 --> 14:46.468
and Kim I-seon and Baek Mi-ju
went home early to rest.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.220
Was anyone else with them at home?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
They both said they were home alone.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.269
ICU VISITING HOURS
YEONHWA HOSPITAL

14:56.770 --> 14:58.564
4:40 P.M.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.918
Are you okay?

15:21.587 --> 15:22.671
You're…

15:24.715 --> 15:25.841
Wait.

16:14.640 --> 16:20.312
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

16:22.856 --> 16:25.401
-Excuse me.
-Yes, Lieutenant?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.237
Some girl left this.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.614
What is it?

16:30.698 --> 16:33.951
I don't know exactly,
but I think it's a USB stick.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.536
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
FILE FOR THE KWAK DO-SEOK CASE

16:35.619 --> 16:39.081
I'm supposed to discard it,
but I kept it just in case.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.044
This was handed to you today?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.547
She came to the court
and gave it to the bailiff.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.217
I checked the security footage
and I couldn't see her face.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.511
But she seemed about Kwak Do-seok's age.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.680
Her handwriting seems so too.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.684
For security reasons,

16:58.767 --> 17:02.855
I'm supposed to discard it immediately
instead of handing it to judges.

17:03.772 --> 17:07.276
But I saw it just in case,
and was shocked.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
What about the sound?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.137
-Is there no sound?
-No.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.015
It seems to have been recorded
on a cell phone,

17:38.098 --> 17:39.433
but there's no sound.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.143
If this actually happened,

17:43.062 --> 17:45.397
Kwak Do-seok's guardian's claims are true.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.985
But why isn't he fighting back?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.946
He used to be an athlete, didn't he?

17:59.536 --> 18:00.996
Judge Cha.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.748
Judge Cha.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.625
Judge Cha.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.135
Others may not know,
but I know how much Do-seok has changed.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.931
It may look like

18:19.890 --> 18:22.226
he was being helplessly beaten, but no.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.520
He held back.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.690
He knew that he'd stand trial again
if he fought back,

18:30.109 --> 18:31.568
so he just put up with it.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.905
He has no reason to forge an ID

18:34.988 --> 18:38.325
and illegally rent a car
to drive without a license.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.703
And the passengers were
those who beat him up.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.664
This doesn't make any sense.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.376
No, it doesn't.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.169
But…

18:50.462 --> 18:53.340
even if those kids assaulted him
or threatened him,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.677
it doesn't change the fact

18:56.760 --> 19:01.598
that a man is in critical condition
because of his driving

19:02.599 --> 19:07.104
and that he himself
rented the car illegally.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.901
We don't even know
where the video came from.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.070
We need to stay cool,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.032
especially at a time like this.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.805
This is Sim Eun-seok.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.725
Please take the original copy of the video

19:44.808 --> 19:47.227
and have it checked to see
if it's been fabricated.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.354
And please make a copy of it as well.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.630
What on earth are they saying?

20:21.511 --> 20:23.639
I'm sorry, Judge Sim. I was in a rush…

20:23.722 --> 20:26.225
It's fine.
What about the video of the assault?

20:26.308 --> 20:29.603
Yes, the video.
I got a response from the analyst.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.564
He said it's not edited or fabricated.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.649
But…

20:34.358 --> 20:36.068
MULTIMEDIA ANALYSIS, AUDIO RESTORED

20:36.902 --> 20:38.570
-Good job.
-Sure.

20:38.654 --> 20:42.950
<i>Huh? Gosh, you motherfucker.
Hey, you bastard. You son of bitch!</i>

20:43.533 --> 20:46.161
<i>Did you just dodge, you bastard? Did you?</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:48.455
<i>You said you'd delete the photos.</i>

20:48.538 --> 20:50.832
-<i>What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:51.875
<i>I will.</i>

20:52.626 --> 20:53.502
What?

20:53.585 --> 20:54.461
<i>Hey.</i>

20:54.544 --> 20:56.338
<i>Don't talk to me like that, you bitch.</i>

20:56.421 --> 20:57.714
<i>What the fuck…</i>

21:00.133 --> 21:02.386
-<i>What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:04.137
<i>I will.</i>

21:04.221 --> 21:05.097
Delete?

21:05.180 --> 21:07.266
<i>What the fuck?
Do you actually like that bitch?</i>

21:12.104 --> 21:13.230
This is Sim Eun-seok.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.484
Are the children
all attending the trial this afternoon?

21:20.737 --> 21:21.863
Come on in.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.290
What is it?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.710
I apologize, Presiding Judge Na.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.214
I heard you were summoned
by the senior presiding judge

21:39.298 --> 21:40.799
a few days ago because of me.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.012
I'll be careful from now on.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.890
She said she'd teach you a lesson.
I guess she did a good job.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.060
You may leave.

21:54.896 --> 21:55.731
Wait.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.943
Yes?

22:00.986 --> 22:03.196
I reprimanded two people.
Why did you come alone?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.907
Well, actually…

22:06.742 --> 22:07.868
Judge Sim Eun-seok is…

22:10.746 --> 22:13.040
I reject your apology.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.293
You should apologize properly.

22:16.793 --> 22:20.213
I don't want to accept
a half-assed apology.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.183
I feel bad about that.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.393
I see.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.937
You feel bad about that?

22:37.147 --> 22:38.774
I'm a victim, too.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.403
A victim?

22:53.580 --> 22:55.916
<i>-What?
-You said you'd delete the photos.</i>

22:55.999 --> 22:57.167
<i>I will.</i>

22:58.668 --> 23:00.003
<i>-Hey.
-You son of bitch.</i>

23:00.087 --> 23:01.922
<i>-Don't talk to me like that, you bitch.
-Hey.</i>

23:02.005 --> 23:03.465
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:05.592
<i>What do you think you're doing, fucker?</i>

23:06.218 --> 23:07.302
<i>You bastard.</i>

23:07.385 --> 23:09.888
<i>-For God's sake. You bastard.</i>
-Stop.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.308
Are you sure you aren't an assailant?

23:18.522 --> 23:21.149
According to the petition
filed by Kwak Do-seok's guardian,

23:22.692 --> 23:24.236
"Kwak Do-seok is a victim."

23:24.319 --> 23:26.947
"He was forced to illegally rent

23:27.531 --> 23:29.407
and drive a car."

23:30.325 --> 23:33.286
"He's been assaulted and threatened
for a long time."

23:33.787 --> 23:36.373
Are you sure you're a victim?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.549
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
FILE FOR THE KWAK DO-SEOK CASE

23:46.800 --> 23:49.094
You remember that, right?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.472
If you don't,

23:52.556 --> 23:56.643
I'll show you the security footage
that shows you bringing it here.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.147
Was it a crime to hand it to you?

24:00.230 --> 24:01.481
No, it's not.

24:02.941 --> 24:03.984
But…

24:05.527 --> 24:06.570
I'm worried.

24:09.531 --> 24:13.368
You have something to do with that
video of Kwak Do-seok being assaulted.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.665
That's probably why you removed
the audio and handed it

24:19.791 --> 24:22.085
to a court officer in secret.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.970
From now on, whatever you say here

24:32.053 --> 24:34.097
will hold no weight legally.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.057
We'll stop recording.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.393
Your friends won't know about it.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.812
So…

24:42.147 --> 24:43.690
feel free to tell me everything.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.451
A spy cam.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.873
Do you know what it feels like…

25:03.877 --> 25:05.503
to be recorded unknowingly?

25:14.262 --> 25:15.430
Let's go here. It's good.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.557
-We should order extra.
-Gosh, I'm so hungry.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.561
<i>Where do you want us to send these?</i>

25:22.229 --> 25:24.272
<i>How would the kids from school react?</i>

25:24.856 --> 25:26.316
<i>Should we send them to your mom?</i>

25:27.025 --> 25:28.985
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

25:29.069 --> 25:31.071
<i>This whore is ignoring us.</i>

25:31.863 --> 25:33.907
Mi-ju. What are you doing?

25:34.491 --> 25:36.284
Come on, let's go.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.869
I'm hungry.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.456
Baek Mi-ju.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.381
My mind completely crumbled.

25:50.548 --> 25:53.260
They asked me to join
an overnight trip to the beach.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.387
It happened while I was asleep.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.891
I asked them to delete the photos,

25:59.975 --> 26:02.227
but they said they would
if I did what they said.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.271
What about Kwak Do-seok?

26:05.772 --> 26:06.856
Later.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.902
He got involved after I told him
what had happened.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.237
Because of the photos?

26:13.863 --> 26:14.948
To delete them for you?

26:17.409 --> 26:18.285
But…

26:20.370 --> 26:22.330
they began to harass him

26:24.708 --> 26:26.876
and it became more and more severe.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.175
Why those…

26:38.471 --> 26:40.223
At the rental shop.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.393
Were you there to stop him?

26:44.185 --> 26:45.145
Yes.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.942
A forged ID and driving without a license.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.903
It was way too crazy.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.405
Hey, Kwak Do-seok!

26:58.450 --> 27:01.745
Do you know what you're doing?
You're done for if you get caught.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.331
-They said this was the last time.
-And you believe them?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.418
Don't worry too much.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.671
I'll make them delete
your photos no matter what.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.131
I'll be back. Wait out there.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.175
Hey!

27:16.843 --> 27:20.180
The photos were deleted eventually,

27:22.015 --> 27:23.183
thanks to Do-seok.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.318
But he ended up the way he is now

27:35.987 --> 27:37.238
because of it.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.702
<i>I'll try persuading her.</i>

27:43.745 --> 27:45.872
If Baek Mi-ju testifies,

27:46.539 --> 27:50.085
we can take it into consideration,
though it was him who drove the car.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.336
He'd feel less wronged.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.047
Judge Sim.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.590
But don't expect too much.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.302
For teenagers, their peer groups
are more important than their lives.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.431
She won't confess
unless she's ready to cut ties with them.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.060
It won't be easy.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.938
Okay.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.817
But is it really right for you to

28:14.984 --> 28:16.319
keep remaining silent?

28:24.327 --> 28:25.453
Baek Mi-ju.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.417
This is your decision to make.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.131
-Judge Sim.
-What is it?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.812
Tell the children and their guardians
and attorney in the waiting room

28:51.688 --> 28:52.981
to come into the courtroom.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.153
I hereby inform you
that this protection case

28:58.236 --> 28:59.571
has been concluded.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.449
-Concluded? All of a sudden?
-Has the case been closed?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.409
-Please be quiet.
-Isn't it a good thing then?

29:04.492 --> 29:06.578
What's the reason?

29:08.204 --> 29:10.331
The victim O Gyu-sang has died.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.083
He died?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.168
Gosh, unbelievable.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.419
<i>Gyu-sang.</i>

29:14.502 --> 29:16.880
What will we do now?

29:21.217 --> 29:22.552
What do I do?

29:22.635 --> 29:25.346
<i>Since Mr. O Gyu-sang,
the car accident victim, has died,</i>

29:25.430 --> 29:28.141
this case will be sent back
to the Prosecutors' Office

29:28.975 --> 29:30.518
tomorrow morning.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.730
If the prosecution presses charges,

29:33.813 --> 29:37.066
a criminal case may be opened against you.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.568
A criminal case?

29:38.651 --> 29:39.986
Please sit down.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.113
This trial is over.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.161
-What's going to happen now?
-It's fine.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.623
Do we need to explain it?

29:52.207 --> 29:53.541
Hey, it's okay.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.418
All right. Let's talk outside.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.336
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

29:56.419 --> 29:59.005
<i>What are you saying?
A juvenile criminal case?</i>

29:59.088 --> 30:00.882
The victim, Mr. O Gyu-sang, has died.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.510
Since the victim has died,

30:03.593 --> 30:05.804
the case has to be
sent back to the prosecution.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.305
What about their confession?

30:08.765 --> 30:11.226
They barely confessed
when it was a protection case.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.686
Won't it be harder now?

30:13.770 --> 30:14.813
Cha Tae-ju.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.357
That's enough.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.153
-Sorry?
-You're obsessed with this case

30:23.530 --> 30:24.823
because you feel guilty.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.830
PROBATION CARD
KWAK DO-SEOK

30:32.914 --> 30:35.250
<i>The boy changed as he promised you.</i>

30:35.333 --> 30:36.918
I'M STUDYING HARD WITH THE WORKBOOK
YOU GOT ME. HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.461
<i>He turned over a new leaf.</i>

30:40.255 --> 30:41.798
<i>But this is how he ended up.</i>

30:43.341 --> 30:44.884
You're being stubborn

30:46.219 --> 30:48.763
because there's nothing more
you can do for him now.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.398
If that boy did everything
he could do to change

30:59.023 --> 31:00.316
and become a better person,

31:02.151 --> 31:04.070
you should do so too.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.241
You shouldn't just cover for him
and side with him.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.034
You should see what he did wrong

31:10.952 --> 31:12.745
and approach the case with a cool head.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.918
Because of the crime they committed,

31:19.961 --> 31:22.422
a boy has been hospitalized
for the rest of his life,

31:23.214 --> 31:25.675
and an innocent family man lost his life.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.970
But no one's willing
to take responsibility.

31:29.053 --> 31:32.682
Everyone is a perpetrator
and they all claim they were wronged.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.559
Doesn't that say anything?

31:35.810 --> 31:39.063
Can't you see
what you really need to do now?

31:56.039 --> 31:59.334
The case that was sent back to
the prosecution due to the victim's death.

31:59.417 --> 32:03.463
Judge Sim, that was your underage
traffic accident case, wasn't it?

32:03.546 --> 32:04.547
Yes.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.468
The prosecution needs
to investigate it further.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.469
What do you mean?

32:09.552 --> 32:11.012
Driver Kwak Do-seok's guardian

32:11.095 --> 32:13.473
and the passengers are making
conflicting statements.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.434
The passengers are suspected of abetting

32:16.517 --> 32:19.354
driving without a license, forgery,
exercising counterfeit documents,

32:19.437 --> 32:22.857
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.109
The Act on Special Cases Concerning
the Settlement of Traffic Accidents

32:25.193 --> 32:26.903
can also be applied.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.989
We also need to see
how we can help compensate

32:30.782 --> 32:34.953
the dead victim's family and
Kwak Do-seok, who's in a vegetative state.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.746
What do you think, Judge Cha?

32:37.413 --> 32:39.457
I agree with Judge Sim.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.461
Because of this accident, one person died,

32:43.544 --> 32:46.047
and another has to be hospitalized
for the rest of his life.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.800
Their families have the right to know

32:48.883 --> 32:52.762
why, how, and by who this happened.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.810
I think judges have a duty
to uncover the truth.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.480
Considering that,
we have too many cold cases.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.442
Uncovering the truth is important.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.820
But if delayed, it isn't justice.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.699
I think juvenile cases
are all about speed.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.328
Do you know how many unsolved cases
there are in our department alone?

33:17.412 --> 33:21.040
Our division has piles of cold cases
because you're like this.

33:21.749 --> 33:24.252
Let's not waste our strength
on trivial cases.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.546
Pay particular attention
to the unsolved ones.

33:26.629 --> 33:27.839
That's it for today.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.869
I thought a lot about
what you said yesterday.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.205
You were right

34:02.749 --> 34:03.750
about everything.

34:05.668 --> 34:11.424
Do-seok reminded me of myself
when I was a teenager,

34:12.633 --> 34:16.512
so the fact that I can no longer
do anything for him…

34:19.182 --> 34:21.184
really tortured me.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.980
Approaching the case with a cool head

34:26.064 --> 34:28.274
and making the right decision

34:29.025 --> 34:33.154
is what I need to do
for Do-seok and the victim.

34:35.948 --> 34:38.201
But I think I was too emotional.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.619
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.665
Okay.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.254
What should we do now?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.513
It's one hurdle after another.

35:19.242 --> 35:23.454
<i>Case number 2022 GH 4012.</i>

35:23.538 --> 35:25.373
<i>The trial begins now.</i>

35:26.541 --> 35:27.834
Attorney.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.710
The prosecution charged
the defendants with

35:29.794 --> 35:32.463
abetting driving without a license,
the violation of the Act on Special Cases

35:32.547 --> 35:35.133
Concerning the Settlement
of Traffic Accidents,

35:35.216 --> 35:36.509
the violation
of the Resident Registration Act,

35:36.592 --> 35:38.511
forgery and the exercise
of counterfeit documents.

35:38.594 --> 35:39.971
Do they admit to the charges?

35:40.054 --> 35:43.057
No, my clients do not.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.893
On what grounds?

35:45.977 --> 35:48.020
They admit that they were
in the car with him,

35:48.104 --> 35:52.108
but they thought Kwak had rented the car
after getting a driver’s license

35:52.733 --> 35:56.696
and didn't aid him
in any of the above charges.

36:00.575 --> 36:04.245
Defendant Lee Nam-gyeong claims
that the driver rented the car,

36:04.328 --> 36:07.582
and when Kang Tae-hun, Kim I-seon,
Baek Mi-ju, and he were together,

36:07.665 --> 36:10.334
he boasted about it
and offered them a ride.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.379
But offering rides to others

36:13.462 --> 36:17.133
implies that the involved parties
know each other or are close.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.264
<i>Hey, you motherfucker! What the fuck!</i>

36:23.347 --> 36:25.933
<i>What are you trying to do, you bastard?</i>

36:26.601 --> 36:30.771
<i>Fuck, get up now. Get up.
Get up, you son of bitch.</i>

36:30.855 --> 36:33.399
<i>Gosh, you motherfucker. Hey, you bastard.</i>

36:33.482 --> 36:35.693
<i>-Hey, you motherfucker!
-Fuck.</i>

36:35.776 --> 36:38.779
The defendants
have already seen this video.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.239
The defendants acted violently

36:40.323 --> 36:43.451
in a fit of rage due to a disagreement
between the two parties.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.953
They are regretting it deeply.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.748
Then what about this?

36:48.831 --> 36:52.126
It's the petition Kwak's guardian
submitted to the court

36:52.210 --> 36:54.420
enclosed with photos
put forward as evidence.

36:54.503 --> 36:59.133
Prosecution. Decide whether
you'll submit them as evidence.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.469
Yes, I'll submit all of them as evidence.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.346
We'll accept them as evidence.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.853
PHOTO EVIDENCE
OF ASSAULT ON KWAK DO-SEOK

37:10.937 --> 37:12.688
The medical staff also stated

37:13.272 --> 37:17.693
that these kinds of wounds
and bruises can only be seen

37:17.777 --> 37:21.864
when someone has been assaulted
severely and over a long term.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.201
According to the evidence,

37:25.284 --> 37:26.744
it seems to be more appropriate

37:26.827 --> 37:31.207
to see their relationship as one of power
rather than friendship.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.379
Therefore, the claim
that they were offered a ride as a favor

37:36.462 --> 37:38.923
is not very convincing.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.427
What are your thoughts?

37:44.971 --> 37:48.266
<i>What we need to focus on
is the children's relationship.</i>

37:49.141 --> 37:51.602
There's only one thing
their attorney claims.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.521
"The kids knew nothing
and had nothing to do with it."

37:53.604 --> 37:55.481
"They only got in
because they were offered a ride."

37:56.440 --> 37:58.693
But there's no evidence that shows

37:58.776 --> 38:02.321
whether Kwak Do-seok was close enough
to offer them a ride.

38:04.532 --> 38:09.662
All we need to see is
whether their claim is reasonable.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.753
All the security footage
from the rental shop shows

38:17.837 --> 38:19.964
that the defendants weren't there.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.010
It was Kwak Do-seok
who presented a forged ID, chose a car,

38:25.136 --> 38:26.762
and signed the contract.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.692
<i>Call Baek Mi-ju to the witness stand.</i>

38:40.276 --> 38:41.986
I know we shouldn't

38:42.069 --> 38:44.196
but I'll meet her
and persuade her somehow.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.032
-No.
-Judge Sim.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.868
That meeting was so that we
could hear her honest thoughts.

38:50.369 --> 38:53.122
We stopped recording,

38:53.205 --> 38:58.461
and I told her what she said there would
not hold any weight in a court of law.

39:01.088 --> 39:03.090
Yes, uncovering the truth is important.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.425
But if things go wrong,

39:05.801 --> 39:08.471
the court could end up
creating another victim.

39:10.890 --> 39:11.807
Witness.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.810
Please state your name and affiliation.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.606
I'm Sergeant Kim Tae-hwan from
the Traffic Control Division in Gangnam.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.859
I stopped the defendants
while cracking down on drunk drivers.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.737
Can you tell us exactly what happened?

39:36.540 --> 39:38.626
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

39:38.709 --> 39:39.710
May I see your ID?

39:41.170 --> 39:42.505
Yes, just a second.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.300
Is something wrong?

39:46.384 --> 39:50.846
The car didn't smell of alcohol
and he passed the breathalyzer test.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.723
But, oddly, the driver was very tense.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.767
The passengers looked young, too.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.646
<i>How did the others in the car react?</i>

39:58.729 --> 40:00.147
<i>Were they nervous, too?</i>

40:01.065 --> 40:03.776
<i>Yes, all four of them seemed nervous.</i>

40:03.859 --> 40:05.986
<i>Especially the girls.</i>

40:06.070 --> 40:07.530
Are you sure?

40:07.613 --> 40:08.739
Yes, I am.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.206
The court will be adjourned
for about an hour.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.511
What's the point of
proceeding with this trial?

40:30.594 --> 40:34.390
Neither side has any clear evidence.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.559
Everything is circumstantial.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.145
Let's wrap it up and draw a conclusion.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.315
Presiding Judge Na.
It's too early to draw--

40:43.399 --> 40:45.818
It depends on how you look at it.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.783
We can't end the trial like this.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.829
As you said,
an innocent person was killed.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.374
Then somebody
must be held accountable for that.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.630
The court has come to a decision.

41:06.714 --> 41:10.384
Because of the crime
the defendants committed,

41:10.468 --> 41:13.637
an innocent family man has died,

41:14.388 --> 41:18.392
and the driver is in a vegetative state.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.855
It has caused two casualties,
which is a dreadful consequence.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.526
However, the defendants
still deny the charges

41:28.360 --> 41:33.782
and do not regret what they've done.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.497
<i>They're first-time offenders</i>

41:40.206 --> 41:42.166
and are accountable for the death
and injuries of the victims.

41:42.249 --> 41:44.043
Neither was it settled out of court.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.462
The penalty for violating the Act
on Settlement of Traffic Accidents

41:46.545 --> 41:47.922
is up to five years imprisonment,

41:48.005 --> 41:49.924
so I think one year at the least

41:50.007 --> 41:52.092
and two and a half years at the longest
is appropriate.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.137
Who said you could apply
the Traffic Accident Act?

41:56.013 --> 41:57.515
We can convict them of abetting

41:57.598 --> 41:58.599
unlicensed driving, forgery,
and exercising counterfeit documents

41:58.682 --> 42:00.893
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act

42:00.976 --> 42:03.812
to turn it into a protection case.

42:03.896 --> 42:05.147
You made a mess of things

42:05.231 --> 42:08.025
by sending the case back
to the prosecution and now what?

42:08.901 --> 42:10.819
You'll apply the Traffic Accident Act?

42:10.903 --> 42:11.862
My goodness.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.323
Do you think our job
is to make convicts of people?

42:18.869 --> 42:19.745
<i>However…</i>

42:20.454 --> 42:22.998
regarding the Act
on Settlement of Traffic Accidents,

42:23.707 --> 42:29.505
there's no causal link
between the accident and the defendants.

42:30.422 --> 42:31.840
We declare them innocent.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.010
They're guilty of abetting
unlicensed driving,

42:35.970 --> 42:40.307
forgery, exercise
of counterfeit documents,

42:40.391 --> 42:42.309
and the violation
of the Resident Registration Act.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.771
But considering their ages, past records,

42:45.854 --> 42:48.732
and the cause of the accident,

42:48.816 --> 42:51.777
we decided that this case should be
handled as a juvenile protection case.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.322
The case will be forwarded
to the juvenile court.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.240
Yes.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.283
Gosh.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.742
-Hey.
-Yes.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.287
-This is awesome.
-Remain silent, please.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.871
My gosh.

43:02.955 --> 43:04.748
We're good now.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.918
-That was a close one.
-Thank you.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.962
<i>It'll be forwarded to the juvenile court?</i>

43:10.546 --> 43:14.258
How can you turn this
into a protection case?

43:14.341 --> 43:16.343
If there's insufficient evidence,

43:16.427 --> 43:18.470
we can schedule another trial
for additional evidence.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.139
What if we do?

43:20.973 --> 43:22.516
Will we be getting new evidence?

43:23.851 --> 43:27.354
For the Traffic Accidents Act
to be applied to the passengers,

43:27.438 --> 43:30.065
we have to consider the passengers
as the perpetrators too.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.860
How are we going to prove that now?

43:33.819 --> 43:38.657
You should know that such cases are rare.
What's wrong with you?

43:38.741 --> 43:41.660
Still, this isn't a protection case.

43:42.536 --> 43:44.496
There are two victims in this case.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.665
Somebody must be held accountable.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.542
And that's not for us to decide.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.796
Let's just put them on probation.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.007
That'd be better for the children

43:55.090 --> 43:57.926
than setting a date again
and giving them a criminal record.

44:02.556 --> 44:05.059
Is it really for the children?

44:08.479 --> 44:09.855
Or is it because…

44:12.024 --> 44:13.734
juvenile cases are all about speed?

44:24.078 --> 44:26.705
-The trial is now--
-Excuse me.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.166
Can I say something?

44:30.751 --> 44:31.710
Who are you?

44:32.211 --> 44:33.295
I'm…

44:36.423 --> 44:38.926
the victim O Gyu-sang's wife.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.469
The victim?

44:42.888 --> 44:43.931
No, you can't.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.016
The trial is over.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.852
No. You can't finish it like this.

44:48.936 --> 44:52.648
Then who killed my husband?

44:52.731 --> 44:56.151
You didn't talk about my husband at all.

44:56.235 --> 45:01.031
My husband was killed wrongfully.
Who's responsible for that?

45:01.115 --> 45:02.866
-Please stop.
-No, I mean…

45:02.950 --> 45:05.994
-You can't just leave like this.
-Aren't you coming?

45:06.078 --> 45:07.746
If you end it like this…

45:07.830 --> 45:10.165
What of my husband then?

45:13.293 --> 45:14.378
Please, Your Honor!

45:15.963 --> 45:17.172
How can you?

45:20.801 --> 45:22.094
What is this?

45:58.464 --> 45:59.631
Thank you.

46:00.799 --> 46:01.758
I'm fine.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.512
Do you remember my voice?

46:06.847 --> 46:09.057
I called you a few times,

46:09.725 --> 46:12.144
but you hung up on me.

46:20.777 --> 46:21.862
Do you think

46:22.905 --> 46:25.908
those children know
what this ruling means?

46:27.075 --> 46:29.244
I felt suffocated at that moment.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.955
<i>It felt so wrong.</i>

46:37.586 --> 46:40.088
They shouldn't be cheering like that.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.091
Do you think…

46:44.635 --> 46:46.220
the ruling was a mistake?

46:47.930 --> 46:48.889
Isn't it?

46:57.314 --> 46:58.565
Excuse me, Judge Cha.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.860
You received a delivery.

47:18.669 --> 47:19.545
Goodbye.

47:34.810 --> 47:35.936
All of you.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.772
You got away with it this time,
but it won't work next time.

47:38.855 --> 47:41.900
Think about what you did wrong. All right?

47:46.029 --> 47:49.449
<i>When there's a car accident…</i>

47:56.456 --> 47:58.292
the driver unconsciously

47:59.626 --> 48:02.004
turns the steering wheel
away from himself.

48:05.007 --> 48:07.175
To avoid being injured
as much as possible.

48:08.635 --> 48:12.806
But what's different about this case was
the direction of the steering wheel.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.393
Unlike most cases,

48:17.227 --> 48:19.271
Kwak Do-seok turned the wheel

48:20.689 --> 48:21.982
towards himself…

48:24.651 --> 48:26.695
receiving most of the impact.

49:26.296 --> 49:29.132
Step on it! I said, step on it, you idiot!

49:29.216 --> 49:30.175
<i>What a wimp.</i>

49:30.258 --> 49:32.594
Speed up, you punk!

49:32.678 --> 49:34.596
-Fuck! Oh, gosh!
-Hey, Do-seok.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.058
If we get caught,
we'll kill you first, motherfucker!

49:38.141 --> 49:40.602
-Hell, yes.
-Fuck!

49:57.786 --> 50:02.457
But we can still laugh, cheer,

50:03.667 --> 50:05.085
and be standing here at court.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.222
Because we're alive.

50:18.890 --> 50:22.310
I won't tell you
not to forget what happened.

50:23.770 --> 50:25.647
But you should at least know,

50:27.315 --> 50:29.151
regardless of the results of the trial,

50:31.027 --> 50:34.656
how many lives…

50:38.660 --> 50:40.704
you've sacrificed…

50:44.332 --> 50:45.667
to be standing here today.

52:01.743 --> 52:02.994
I'm sorry.

52:04.996 --> 52:07.374
I came here to tell you this.

52:13.964 --> 52:16.174
No, forget it. I don't need it.

52:16.758 --> 52:19.261
Wait, after my son ended up like that,

52:20.303 --> 52:22.389
I finally realized then

52:23.932 --> 52:26.059
what he had done.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.062
How and why…

52:31.231 --> 52:34.651
For some people,
it may just be a story in the paper.

52:35.694 --> 52:38.697
We'll be just defendants
and victims to them.

52:40.407 --> 52:44.578
But, for us, they're a husband and a son.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.208
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.295
I will never forget what my son did wrong

52:53.378 --> 52:55.922
for the rest of my life.

52:59.759 --> 53:03.179
I'll reflect on it
for the rest of my life.

53:04.639 --> 53:05.932
I'm sorry.

53:07.225 --> 53:08.560
I'm sorry.

53:09.853 --> 53:13.356
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't apologize!

53:14.065 --> 53:16.109
What's the point of all this now?

53:17.319 --> 53:20.739
So what if he got beat up a little?

53:20.822 --> 53:23.491
You can still go and see your son's face!

53:23.575 --> 53:25.452
I can't see my husband anymore!

53:26.828 --> 53:29.164
He's already dead!

53:30.665 --> 53:32.626
Give me back my husband!

53:32.709 --> 53:35.503
Bring my poor husband back to life!

53:37.964 --> 53:41.509
Bring him back to life!
What did we do wrong?

53:50.393 --> 53:54.940
I feel so bad for my child.

53:57.984 --> 54:00.403
What should I do? How do I go on living?

54:11.289 --> 54:15.293
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

54:44.072 --> 54:45.615
TO CHA TAE-JU
FROM KWAK DO-SEOK

54:52.747 --> 54:55.625
<i>MY TEACHER'S DIARY</i> BY KANG TAE-SOO

54:57.377 --> 54:58.795
<i>What is this?</i>

54:58.878 --> 55:02.048
That's my favorite book.

55:02.132 --> 55:05.010
I underlined some of the passages,

55:05.677 --> 55:07.178
so try reading those at least.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.181
<i>MY TEACHER'S DIARY</i> BY KANG TAE-SOO

55:10.265 --> 55:11.141
Thank you.

55:13.184 --> 55:14.936
<i>This is Do-seok's mom.</i>

55:15.437 --> 55:20.442
<i>Do-seok wrapped this himself
to return it to you.</i>

55:21.693 --> 55:23.445
<i>I'm finally returning it to you.</i>

55:25.405 --> 55:28.366
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

55:37.459 --> 55:39.377
<i>"And Paul said,</i>

55:40.420 --> 55:41.296
<i>'Come to me.</i>

55:42.005 --> 55:45.592
<i>I still have many things to teach you.'"</i>

55:47.677 --> 55:51.765
<i>"What's important in life is a comma,
not a period."</i>

55:53.308 --> 55:55.518
<i>"So you don't need to be anxious."</i>

55:58.438 --> 56:00.231
<i>"Anyone can make mistakes."</i>

56:02.650 --> 56:04.277
<i>"Mistakes</i>

56:05.820 --> 56:07.614

56:10.617 --> 56:12.786
<i>"You can start over again at any time."</i>

57:15.515 --> 57:17.559
<i>Do you think the ruling was a mistake?</i>

57:19.769 --> 57:20.979
Isn't it?

57:27.193 --> 57:28.486
That's just how the law is.

57:29.696 --> 57:34.075
The law doesn't protect every victim.

57:35.034 --> 57:38.538
The law only makes judgments
based on evidence.

57:39.622 --> 57:40.915
<i>That's just how the law is.</i>

57:41.541 --> 57:42.917
<i>You know that.</i>

58:01.769 --> 58:02.896
<i>That's right.</i>

58:05.273 --> 58:06.524
<i>That's just how</i>

58:08.318 --> 58:09.360
<i>the law is.</i>

58:29.464 --> 58:31.257
You have many records to go over today.

58:33.092 --> 58:34.677
You should go over this one quickly.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.387

58:36.471 --> 58:39.766
The case has been divided into
criminal and protection cases.

58:39.849 --> 58:42.143
Really? What case is it…
