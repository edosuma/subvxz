[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.763 --> 00:15.932
I tried to buy his land for our stadium.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.643
I sold the land to DiFiore Exports.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.270
[in Spanish] You're now DiFiore Exports

00:20.353 --> 00:21.771
-and the land is yours.
-What's this?

00:21.855 --> 00:24.024
I was supposed to give you this
as a threat.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.442
Now I'm giving it as a warning.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.735
Well, I'm up for anything.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.820
So if you need me,
you know where to find me, boss.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.322
There was a time
I couldn't live without you.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.742
Now I can't stand the sight of you.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.119
I went ahead and bought NTNR Enterprises,

00:36.202 --> 00:39.706
the company that owns your--
Well, no, my publishing house.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.916
There's an author here to see you.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.918
Fallon, what the hell is going on?

00:47.839 --> 00:48.965
[Fallon] Wow.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.551
Uh, I was-- I was just about to go
anywhere else.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.429
[Fallon] Well...

00:56.055 --> 00:57.223
this is a surprise.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.225
You look good.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.937
-And you bought a publishing company.
-Crazy, right?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.690
-The company that's publishing my book.
-Yes. It appears that way.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.108
Can I get you a drink?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.945
Do you get some sort of perverse pleasure
out of messing with me?

01:11.029 --> 01:11.863
Excuse me?

01:11.946 --> 01:14.115
Wreaking havoc on my personal life
is despicable enough,

01:14.199 --> 01:16.117
but this is my career, Fallon.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.037
No, no, no.
This is all just a horrible coincidence.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.581
Like that time I went skiing
with Ashley in Idaho

01:21.664 --> 01:24.751
-and you showed up at the same ski lodge?
-Yes. I mean, no.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.754
Not like that, because this is
a legit coincidence, okay?

01:27.837 --> 01:30.048
-I bought this--
-You're the same old Fallon.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.716
I'm not the same old Fallon.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.010
This is the new and improved Fallon.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.262
Okay. I am doing something with my life,

01:36.346 --> 01:40.600
and I assure you I don't want Liam Ridley
or John Southside to have any part in it.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.893
Nice porn name, by the way.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.688
To prove it, I will rip up whatever
contract this company has with you.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.024
You can't just tear up my contract, that--

01:48.983 --> 01:50.276
You had it sitting right there?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.695
It was symbolic.
Although it did feel good.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.116
Look, Femperial is focused
on female empowerment,

01:56.199 --> 01:58.785
and I don't really feel like
you check that box.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.538
-Maybe you should read my book first.
-I don't need to

02:01.621 --> 02:03.414
because I have no interest
in publishing it.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.918
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
more important matters to attend to.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.008
You can just mail me my penalty check.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.468
Oh, yeah. Per my contract,

02:15.552 --> 02:17.011
if you don't publish my book,

02:17.512 --> 02:19.180
I get a buyout of 6 million.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.516
Well worth it.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.268
Now get out of my office.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.775
Atlanta is a big city.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.236
There are other places
to build your conservatory.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.155
True, but Blake has to pay
for what he's done.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.948
Don't start, Jeff.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.450
What happened to my enlightened brother

02:39.534 --> 02:41.452
that swore off feuding
to turn over a new leaf?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.621
That leaf died after I reached out to Mom

02:43.705 --> 02:45.707
and she rejected my offer to come home.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.959
Silver lining,

02:48.418 --> 02:51.880
as co-owner of Blake's soccer team,
you profit from his dirty deeds.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.716
You more than anyone should know
it's not about money.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.093
-I hate to be the one defending Blake.
-Then don't.

02:57.176 --> 03:00.263
He did keep his promise
and start the Kick the Habit campaign.

03:00.346 --> 03:04.017
Although their poster child, PJ Reed,
might have fell off the wagon.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.186
-What?
-I kicked him out of the club last week

03:07.270 --> 03:09.981
after he was snorting
God knows what in the bathroom.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.901
Let's hope his habit
doesn't tank the entire program,

03:12.984 --> 03:15.403
-or worse, the team.
-Yeah.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.113
Here's hoping.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.324
[Cristal in Spanish]
Beto, we need to talk.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.868
I'm worried about the file you gave me.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.330
If Father is planning something
against Blake, just...

03:25.747 --> 03:26.956
Please call me.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.874
[loud explosion]

03:29.000 --> 03:30.001
Blake.
Blake!

03:31.586 --> 03:33.421
Sorry about that noise, Miss Flores.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.881
The Rolls backfired again.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.717
-I'll take it in for service next week.
-[Sam] What happened?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.927
Are you okay?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.511
I need air. I'm freaking out.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.890
[Sam] Ever since your brother left,
you've been on edge.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.476
What really happened between you two? Hmm?

03:46.893 --> 03:50.271
Tell me the truth because I'm up
to my eyeballs in all the deceit.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.483
Beto was here on behalf of my father.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.945
He helped Blake and I
secure the land for the Atlantix Stadium.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.905
But then he wanted a favor in return.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.866
I'm guessing it wasn't a "can you drive me
to the airport" kind of favor.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.369
He wanted me to hire a ringer
for the team.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.497
A player to throw games,
so he could profit off gambling.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.458
-You didn't do it, did you?
-No. Of course I didn't.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.543
Which is why now he's aiming his wrath

04:12.627 --> 04:14.587
-at this entire family.
-Including me?

04:15.171 --> 04:16.923
Does he know
I'm in the process of a divorce?

04:17.005 --> 04:19.300
Sam, we are all in danger.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.761
But knowing Papa,
he'll target Blake first.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.888
-I don't know what to do.
-I do.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.765
Tell Blake immediately.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.144
I need a report from the crew
on the field status.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.479
-Jen.
-[Jen] Yes, Mr. Carrington?

04:31.562 --> 04:34.565
Make sure the mayor gets an invitation
to join me in my suite on opening day.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.360
I need everybody on top of things.
We got two weeks.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.987
-[man] Right away.
-[Blake] There he is.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.364
-Hey.
-The future of the Carrington empire.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.951
Not exactly, but Atlantix's head physician
has a nice ring to it.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.661
Let me show you to your office.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.249
I'm proud to have my son
working in the family business.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.543
-Well, that means a lot.
-[Jeff] Blake.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.420
This is an unpleasant surprise.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.671
You didn't think I'd stay away

04:56.754 --> 04:59.173
once I discovered your scheme
involving my land, did you?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.174
There's no scheme.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.343
You sold it, I bought it. Makes me smart.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.722
You put your selfish needs
ahead of the community once again

05:05.805 --> 05:07.265
-and that ends now.
-Is that a threat?

05:07.348 --> 05:09.684
Call it a, uh, co-owner's right.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.228
The days of my silent partnership
are over.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.605
From now on, I'm gonna be very vocal,

05:14.689 --> 05:16.691
to ensure the needs
of this community are met.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.152
Needs can only be met
if the team is a success.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.862
I think we all agree on that, right, Jeff?

05:20.945 --> 05:22.030
Cute trick, Blake.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
You made your condescending voice
come out of Junior's mouth.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.534
I didn't even see your lips move.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.787
But, uh, yeah, we all want the team
to be a success,

05:29.871 --> 05:31.122
which is why to show my support,

05:31.205 --> 05:35.043
I plan to host a preseason kickoff party
for everyone at Club Colby.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.127
How generous of you.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.754
Gosh, it is, isn't it?

05:38.212 --> 05:42.300
Now, if you'll just show me to my office,
I won't take up any more of your time.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.885
That's unfortunate. Ahem.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.303
There are no free offices.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.306
Your arrival here was so unexpected.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.184
I'll give you a day
to come up with something.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.227
After all, I am a team player.

05:53.895 --> 05:54.854
Go Atlantix.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.693
-Hey, he's up to something.
-Yeah, you think so?

06:00.777 --> 06:01.903
[Blake] He's a Colby.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.530
No matter how much I bend over backwards
for that family,

06:04.614 --> 06:05.865
they'll never respect us.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.744
Well, somebody should do
something about that.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.123
[Fallon] <i>Glo?</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.000
Did you just say that
with a straight face?

06:16.084 --> 06:19.253
Gloria Collins.
She's a hugely popular feminist on social.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.881
She grew her fan base through her podcast,
<i>Finding Your Inner Glo,</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:25.426
which featured discussions
about finding your authentic female self

06:25.510 --> 06:26.803
in a patriarchal world.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.472
Wow. Well, Glo sounds like my soulmate

06:29.555 --> 06:32.391
and the perfect first author
for our rebranding.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.269
I've been stalking her on Instagram,
she writes at a coffee shop here.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.314
-I'll turn on my Carrington charm.
-Actually, don't do that.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.149
She's cool. So, just keep it chill.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.948
Glo? Oh, my God. I can't believe it's you.

06:47.031 --> 06:47.949
We are big fans.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.160
Your call for women to reclaim symbols
traditionally used to objectify us

06:51.244 --> 06:53.204
made me feel more confident
about being myself.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.580
Enough. Can we sit?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.165
Please. Have a seat. Yes.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.085
It's always nice to hear
I'm having an effect on the front lines.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.587
We would like you
to have even more of an effect.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.880
We heard you're writing a book,

07:02.964 --> 07:06.843
and we'd love to bring it to the market
with my company, Femperial Publishing.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.262
Fallon Carrington?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.264
Since when are you in publishing?

07:11.347 --> 07:12.849
I haven't made the announcement yet.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.976
I wanted to build my arsenal up first.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.438
But after a disastrous experience
with my own book,

07:18.521 --> 07:20.565
I realized we need more women in power

07:20.648 --> 07:23.651
giving other women the opportunity
to tell their stories.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.570
-So, that's my mission.
-[Gloria] Very cool.

07:25.653 --> 07:29.073
But I've already got offers
from other publishers, big publishers.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.243
It's my first book, you know,
and I want it to be big.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.120
Femperial is young and hungry.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.204
We can do big.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.123
Your launch would be our main priority.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.125
I would work with you personally
on its promotion.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.919
You'd never get that kind of attention
with a big publishing house.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.005
I will pass your offer over to my agent,

07:44.088 --> 07:47.884
but just to warn you, bidding for my book
is already at 6 million.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.012
We will match the 6 million.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.056
Give us 48 hours to show you
what else we can do for you.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.101
Okay. I'm wide open to being impressed.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.354
But I've got to go someplace
quieter to finish this book.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.273
Looking forward to hearing your ideas.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.900
-[Fallon] We'll be in touch.
-Bye.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.109
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.406
Not yet, and never that.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.951
Femperial cannot afford to pay
both Liam and Gloria.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.454
You only have to pay Liam
if you don't publish him, right?

08:16.537 --> 08:17.622
So, publish his book.

08:17.705 --> 08:21.250
I am not working with Liam, Kirby.
You were in Sun Valley.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.586
Where you made a mockery
of your dignity, self-esteem,

08:23.669 --> 08:25.296
and feminism in general? Yes, I was there.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.758
So, you see how I can't get emotionally
entangled again, okay?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.344
But it's fine.
I just need to focus on the future.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.597
But if I can get Liam
to back out of his contract,

08:36.224 --> 08:39.434
-we won't have to pay his fee.
-You can charm him into quitting?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.437
Oh, I can get him to quit,

08:42.020 --> 08:43.898
but I sure as hell won't be charming.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.716
[Culhane] Hey, Kirby.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.427
Hey, stranger.
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

09:13.511 --> 09:16.222
I was just dropping off
some Atlantix merch for Blake.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.725
Never pegged you as a kale sort of gal.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.270
Well, technically,
you've never pegged me at all.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.063
[chuckles]

09:24.146 --> 09:26.774
And exactly what kind of girl
did you see me as?

09:26.857 --> 09:29.402
The kind that would call me out
for a dumbass comment like that.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.820
-I had no choice.
-Yeah.

09:30.903 --> 09:35.116
Well, seeing as how you're saving my ass
with the Kick the Habit campaign,

09:35.199 --> 09:36.117
you are forgiven.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.035
I owe you bigtime.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.454
Um, about that.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.582
I took a gig working for Fallon,

09:42.665 --> 09:44.959
which means I'll have
less free time for you.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.504
Well, less free time for business, I mean.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.552
-Congrats.
-I'm not abandoning you.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.347
I'm compiling a list of rehab centers
you can partner with in Atlanta.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.224
I'm almost done. Um...

10:00.600 --> 10:03.352
I can bring it by your office later
if you want.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.437
That will be great.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.190
And I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this...

10:11.360 --> 10:12.236
and you.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.406
[George] <i>The doctors say</i>
<i>you're ahead of schedule.</i>

10:17.408 --> 10:18.284
Mm.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.078
We should have you out of those
bandages in a few days.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.623
-I think that's fantastic news, don't you?
-Mm-hm.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.792
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.420
I just wanted to see
how you were doing, Alexis.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.380
I'll leave these right here.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.174
It's... It's kind of you to come.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.175
I hope you can stay.
Do you?

10:35.968 --> 10:39.263
We got started off on the wrong foot,
and I'm sorry about that.

10:39.805 --> 10:44.769
It's a complicated family, as you know,
and I'm still finding my way around.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.687
-Mm-hm. Yeah. I understand.
-I know.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.606
You and Blake have had your differences,

10:48.689 --> 10:50.858
-but if I can help in any way...
-Thank you.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.402
A healthy team
needs a healthy community, right?

10:53.486 --> 10:57.448
And I was thinking maybe we could do local
health fairs, flu shot drives.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.825
I was thinking about youth sports leagues,

11:00.076 --> 11:01.869
but I like the idea
of a healthy families push.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.245
See?

11:03.537 --> 11:04.580
Great minds.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.499
-We must be related.
-Mm.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.625
[cell phone beeps]

11:07.708 --> 11:08.542
Sorry.
Everything okay?

11:12.713 --> 11:16.092
Yeah. Just some... team medical business.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.343
Mind if I head out?

11:17.802 --> 11:18.677
Sure.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.265
Let me know if I can help.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.185
[Blake] <i>He did what?</i>

11:26.560 --> 11:29.355
He wanted me to hire Carlos Aguirre
to throw games.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.732
Don't worry, I didn't comply.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.402
But now we are all at risk because of it.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.570
Papa makes demands,

11:36.987 --> 11:39.532
and if you don't give in to them,
you suffer the consequences.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.699
[Blake sighs]

11:41.450 --> 11:42.284
I see.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.662
I should have told you right away,

11:44.745 --> 11:46.872
but I thought I could handle him
on my own.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.416
I'm worried, Blake.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.085
[chuckles]

11:53.045 --> 11:55.631
Honey, there's a saying
amongst billionaires:

11:55.714 --> 11:58.259
If nobody wants you dead,
you're not screwing the right people.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.636
No, no, no. Blake, this is different.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.847
-My father is a vengeful person.
-Yeah?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.473
-So am I.
-[sighs]

12:04.723 --> 12:06.725
And I am certainly not afraid of him.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.519
His threats are serious.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.230
It's easy to make idle threats
from 2,000 miles away.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.191
I have just as much power
and influence as he does.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.694
Mm. It's not about that. This is personal.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.405
Freddie is not just my driver.
He's a security guard.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.198
-I'll be fine.
-No, <i>mi amor--</i>

12:21.282 --> 12:23.868
Trust me, you're overreacting.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.870
Nothing is gonna happen.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.163
Mm.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.253
Welcome to Carrington Cottage.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.716
Oh, my God.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.551
That's incredible.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.178
And the views.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.430
We know how much you love
a good flat white

12:44.513 --> 12:48.017
with single-origin espresso beans
and organic non-GMO almond milk.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.103
That is why we got you
your very own barista

12:51.187 --> 12:53.189
who will make one any time you want.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.148
Hi, Shane.

12:55.149 --> 12:59.153
We thought the serenity of the space would
help you focus on finishing your book.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.531
A personal massage therapist
will be available for you daily.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.616
Hi, Blaine.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.326
[Fallon] Self-care is important,

13:05.409 --> 13:07.828
if you're gonna have enough energy
to overthrow the patriarchy.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.999
[Kirby] That's why we got you a meditation
guide, an accountability coach,

13:12.082 --> 13:13.667
and an emotional support dog.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.086
All just a text away,
and all on us of course.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.006
Wow. And I haven't even signed with you.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.343
Yet. But if you do choose Femperial
to be your home,

13:22.426 --> 13:24.303
all of these perks will be permanent.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.639
Thank you.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.432
I mean...

13:29.099 --> 13:30.100
I could get used to this.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.560
I think you should.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.854
We'll leave you to write.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.362
-How did it go with Jeff?
-Great. He's starting to trust me.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.613
Good. Good work.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.782
But I think we have a bigger problem.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.993
I just got word they're sending
an NSF league rep

13:48.077 --> 13:51.664
to administer drug tests today
on certain players.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.082
PJ Reed's on that list.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.918
It's a bit of a surprise,
but it shouldn't be a problem.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.799
When I met with the players earlier,

14:01.882 --> 14:05.553
I ran some prelim drugs tests,
and I just got the results.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.470
PJ failed,

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682
which means he'll fail his official test.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.268
If drugs are found in his system,
he's out for the season.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.602
That son of a bitch.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.272
We went out on a limb for him.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.109
We started an entire anti-drug campaign

14:20.192 --> 14:21.860
based on his comeback-kid story.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.571
Ticket holders bought in because of him.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.155
It'd be a huge embarrassment.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.785
A suspension would be a black eye
on the team's image and standing.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.120
He has to play.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.789
And he has to pass that drug test.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.875
You understand?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.293
Perfectly.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.554
[dance music playing]

14:49.096 --> 14:50.097
[grunting]

15:03.527 --> 15:04.737
Goodness sake.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.740
You need to learn to control
those high kicks, Sam.

15:07.823 --> 15:12.328
This is tae kwon do,
not a Royal Rumble at the WWE.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.413
It's not easy harnessing all this power.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.956
What happened to the flowers?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.959
Sensei Anders is teaching me
some martial arts.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.878
The correct title is Sabum Anders.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.837
Mm, whatever.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.340
Just as long as you turn my hands and feet
into lethal weapons.
Well, your feet already
killed these tulips,

15:26.926 --> 15:30.387
I suggest your hands are better served
dialing 911.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
-[groans]
-If you'll excuse me.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.016
Okay. What's up, Sam?

15:34.099 --> 15:36.143
Well, after our talk,

15:36.226 --> 15:39.438
it seemed like a good time to brush up
on my self-defense skills.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.149
Like you said, we don't know
when your family might pay a visit.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.442
Speaking of...

15:43.734 --> 15:44.860
Did you talk to Blake?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.528
How soon can he up security?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.573
I tried, but he refuses to accept
he's not in control.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.574
That's not good.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.242
We have to remain vigilant,

15:52.326 --> 15:55.079
and hope Roberto
convinces my dad to stand down.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.082
-You could have just mailed me my check.
-About that.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.585
Change of plans.
I'm publishing your book after all.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.879
-Oh. So you read it?
-Don't flatter yourself.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.881
Less than zero interest in reading it.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.176
The truth is, we don't have the money
to pay your penalty,

16:09.259 --> 16:12.221
meaning it'll actually be cheaper
to publish your book.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.057
But I'm still thinking
a small first-print run

16:15.140 --> 16:16.684
of 3,000 copies.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.602
-Is that a joke?
-No, it's not.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.729
We're a startup. Money is very tight.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.817
Most of our budget gets spent on signing
new authors, not old hacky ones.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.737
And in that vein, we had to make a few
tweaks to your upcoming press tour.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.825
[scoffs]

16:33.742 --> 16:36.787
So, instead of going to New York,
L.A., and the big markets,

16:36.870 --> 16:39.081
I'm now going to Poughkeepsie, Topeka...

16:39.456 --> 16:41.542
Fallon, where in the hell is Frankenmuth?

16:41.625 --> 16:45.045
It's a quaint little town somewhere
south of Canada that you'll love,

16:45.129 --> 16:47.506
and it'll love you right back.
Dress warmly.

16:47.589 --> 16:51.176
Oh, and one more thing.
We do not have a social media strategist,

16:51.260 --> 16:53.429
-so, we won't be able to handle your--
-I get it.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.306
You're trying to make this deal
so terrible that I quit the contract?

16:58.183 --> 17:01.020
No. I'm simply being honest
about what we have to offer.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.271
I completely understand

17:02.354 --> 17:04.940
if you feel your book
would be better served elsewhere.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.775
Looks like ruthless Fallon is back.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.901
I'm not quitting.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.904
If you want me gone, cut me a check.

17:11.070 --> 17:11.905
Not possible.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.159
Then I'm staying. And you're following
through my with my press event tonight.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.367
We were planning to.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.996
-Must have been too late to cancel.
-Non-refundable deposit.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.749
-Don't bother showing up tonight.
-Are you kidding?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.041
I wouldn't miss it.

17:27.087 --> 17:27.963
Knock, knock.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.256
Special delivery.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.593
As promised, a list of rehab centers
the campaign can work with.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.470
Finished already? My hero.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.846
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.307
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm such a klutz.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.560
No. You are human, and a fine one at that.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.729
Why don't I take you to lunch?

17:46.899 --> 17:47.900
As a thank you.

17:49.151 --> 17:49.985
Lunch?

17:50.402 --> 17:51.278
Today?

17:51.945 --> 17:52.946
As in now?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.075
You know what? I actually--
I should get back to work.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.244
-You know, it's first week and all that.
-Yeah.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.497
I get it.
You know, a girl's got to hustle.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.420
[woman] Mr. Culhane? Oh.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.755
I'm sorry.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.008
I have the player development reports
you requested.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.052
I will take those.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.595
Thank you.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.930
Okay.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.311
-Sorry about that.
-Maybe it was for the best.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.523
-I mean, it was nice. It's just...
-Yeah.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.694
If this is gonna go any further,
then we should probably talk to Fallon.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.197
Not that we need her permission,
but being her ex-fiancé...

18:35.280 --> 18:37.574
I think I should be the one to tell her.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.701
You know, girl code.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.204
Sisters before misters, and all that.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.330
Have it your way.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.915
I'm sure Fallon will be fine.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.292
-Oh, Fallon? Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:50.838 --> 18:51.713
Hello.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.842
I saw in your Insta story
that you're working here again.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.301
Something wrong with the cottage?

18:56.385 --> 18:59.888
I mean, we can move you to our
Buckhead penthouse, if you'd prefer.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.558
-Shane travels.
-No. It's not that.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.517
Was it the masseuse?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.228
Because, you know, I pegged you
for a shiatsu person,

19:06.311 --> 19:09.148
-and I should have listened to my gut.
-Masseuse is not the problem.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.607
Or Shane.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.611
I shouldn't be making decisions
based on superficial perks.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.322
They're not superficial
if the perks motivate you to write.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.951
What motivates me to write is being
in the real world with real people.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.328
We can hire real people
to hang out at the cottage.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.830
How many do you want? Fifty?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.039
A hundred? I'll get a bus.

19:26.123 --> 19:29.376
Okay. I'm not sure
you get my philosophy or me, Fallon.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.920
The women whose voices
I'm trying to amplify,

19:32.004 --> 19:33.630
most of them don't get perks.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.425
If my grandma saw me
in that curated ivory tower,

19:36.508 --> 19:37.843
I'd never hear the end of it.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.595
It's a no to the bus?

19:39.678 --> 19:40.512
[chuckles]

19:40.846 --> 19:42.264
Look, you're right.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
I did exactly what my dad would have done
to win you over,

19:45.767 --> 19:48.020
or any middle-aged man
trying to get you into bed.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.688
Tell your grandma I'm sorry.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.481
My grandma is a feminist and a writer.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.319
She grew up with no money
and few opportunities.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.613
She would tell me to stay true
and grounded.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.199
Look, I got to warn you,

20:00.282 --> 20:02.159
my agent's pushing me
to take Doubleday's offer.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.076
No, no, no.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.539
Just, please, I am positive that we can
get your message out there.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.625
Just give me one more chance
to explain our strategy.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.335
You said you'd give me two days.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.004
-I have one day left.
-I am a woman of my word.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.589
All right. I got to go.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.675
Blake, you got a second?

20:18.759 --> 20:21.720
-I got a budget question for you.
-It's not a good time.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.181
I've been reviewing the overall budget

20:24.264 --> 20:26.016
and there seems to be a discrepancy
between the expenses
and the account balance,

20:28.310 --> 20:30.812
to the tune of $10 million.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.189
Yes.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.441
That money is set aside for investors.

20:34.524 --> 20:38.070
You didn't think to share that with the
co-owner and head of Player Development?

20:38.528 --> 20:41.365
It was a deal that was put into place
long before you entered the game.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.491
I'm in the game now.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.244
We should sit down
so you can catch me up to speed.

20:45.327 --> 20:49.206
You should sit down and start
acting grateful for this opportunity,

20:49.289 --> 20:52.376
an opportunity that you seem
hell-bent on sabotaging.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.503
I've got 30 years' experience
in corporate America.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.879
You've got three weeks.
I'm doing you a favor.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.300
You're gonna crash and burn
as fast as you ascended

21:00.384 --> 21:02.761
if you don't let me do my business my way.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.346
Any questions?

21:04.888 --> 21:05.722
Now, that's better.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.939
That should about do it
for the signatures.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.024
We'll turn the samples around
in less than 24 hours.

21:16.108 --> 21:16.942
Sounds great.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.362
Hey, next time you come,
we might be in our new training facility.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.947
Have you seen our plans?

21:22.030 --> 21:25.325
-No, I should get going--
-You're a tech guy. Let me show you.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.245
Everything in the building,
from toilets to trash cans,

21:28.328 --> 21:29.830
is gonna be state of the art.

21:29.913 --> 21:33.000
We're gonna get everything our players
need to keep the competitive edge.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.001
[Khan] Impressive.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.504
[Blake] Got acupuncturists, cryotherapy
chambers, we even have a GyroStim.

21:37.587 --> 21:40.340
-[Khan] I don't know what that is.
-[Blake] A chair they strap you in,

21:40.424 --> 21:42.759
they spin you around,
it helps you get over head injuries.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.012
-[Khan] Sounds counterintuitive.
-It does.

21:45.095 --> 21:49.599
But it helped Sidney Crosby get over
his chronic concussion symptoms.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.310
You should read about it.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.227
[George] Doctor Khan.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.855
Adam. They told me you were in a meeting.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.315
I was. But I didn't wanna miss you.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.983
-Good to see you.
-How you been?

21:58.066 --> 22:00.360
[Jeff] I guess this is where
all the action happens.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.990
You can't turn your back for a second
around here.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.825
Who knows what you might miss.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.870
Well, I need to get these samples in.

22:12.789 --> 22:13.707
Bye.
Enjoy your coffee.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.016
-Hey, I need to talk to you.
-Glo hasn't signed yet.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.684
But I have a plan.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.644
We're taking her to dinner at Chops,

22:34.728 --> 22:37.189
-which means you can't wear that.
-Liam quit?

22:37.272 --> 22:40.692
Not yet, but I'm hoping we can
swap authors by the end of the night.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.695
I am amazed at how well
you've handled all this Liam stuff.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.865
As long as he doesn't take his shirt off
or look at me,

22:46.948 --> 22:48.408
I should be able to stay focused.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.579
Shirtless men, especially with eyes,
are totally my weakness, too.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.956
It was hard enough getting Culhane
out of my orbit,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.251
and then working together
at the Atlantix office. It was a disaster.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.212
I can't make that same mistake again.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.798
Anyway, wear this.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.132
You're representing Femperial.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.384
You can't look like a peasant.
No offense, peasant.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.595
I didn't think I was allowed to wear
your clothes.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.931
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think that you liked me.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.935
I don't hate you. But that does not mean
we're gonna start dressing alike.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.355
Like when we were kids and worked
at the tennis club as ball girls?

23:18.438 --> 23:20.941
If memory serves, you only lasted a day.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.902
Squatting in a short skirt
always felt demeaning to me.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.822
Although I did save money
to buy penny stocks.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.866
If I had invested my money
instead of blowing it on Barbies,

23:29.950 --> 23:31.576
I'd be a millionaire, too.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.996
Now I feel bad for stealing them
and then selling them back to you.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.040
You offered discounts. You were fair.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.000
You know, Kirby, I, uh...

23:40.544 --> 23:43.004
I'm sorry I haven't always been
a perfect friend.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.174
I'll get better. I promise.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.846
Is something on your mind?

23:50.929 --> 23:53.390
Or are you still mad about
what happened to the Dreamhouse?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.183
I'm just, um...

23:56.560 --> 23:58.520
thinking about how far we've come.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.105
I'm glad.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.023
Thanks for this.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.529
[dance music playing]

24:18.290 --> 24:19.958
Why did you invite that loser?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.877
I ought to kick his ass out.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.879
Trust me, I want you to.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.548
But he's a co-owner like me.
It'd look petty not inviting him.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.966
I can rock petty.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.677
Moni, club looks amazing.
All right? Have some fun.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.472
[Sam] Why aren't any of these players hot?

24:37.100 --> 24:40.562
-[Blake] What are you doing in here?
-I asked Freddie to stay close.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.231
I know you don't think Papa is a risk,
but trust me.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.609
-He's not gonna let this go.
-You're being ridiculous.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.028
Kim K got robbed and held
at gunpoint in Paris.

24:48.111 --> 24:48.987
So what?

24:49.070 --> 24:51.615
So, if the Kardashians aren't safe
from lunatics, no one is.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.367
I don't need a bodyguard at my own party.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.828
Freddie, get a snack
and go wait in the car.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.546
Okay. Since when does coffee after dinner
include a blindfold?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.798
It's worth the wait. We promise.

25:08.882 --> 25:09.716
Okay.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.053
-Welcome to Glo Fest.
-[all cheering]

25:13.720 --> 25:15.805
This is incredible. How did you...?

25:17.182 --> 25:20.810
Well, you said you wanted
to be near your fans. Here they are.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.939
<i>"Time to Glo Up."</i>

25:24.189 --> 25:25.690
We know it's not finished yet,

25:25.774 --> 25:28.485
but we thought we'd put a spin
on your "finding your inner Glo" mantra

25:28.568 --> 25:29.569
for the title of the book.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.864
Especially since you'll be the face
of our company once you sign with us.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.157
[Fallon] We believe in you.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.700
You are being live-streamed

25:35.784 --> 25:38.161
to over a hundred coffee shops
around the world.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.788
[people cheering on tv]

25:40.205 --> 25:41.414
[Gloria laughing]

25:41.831 --> 25:42.666
Hi.

25:42.749 --> 25:46.878
And we flew in your biggest fan
from Miami.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.756
-Glo.
-Grandma.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.925
We're so proud of you, sweetheart.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.927
We even convinced her
to come out of retirement

25:54.010 --> 25:55.637
and write the foreword for your book.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.223
I can't believe you guys did this.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.849
What if I don't sign with you?

26:01.017 --> 26:03.144
Well, consider it free publicity

26:03.228 --> 26:05.814
for a voice that deserves to be heard
over all the chatter.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.942
But just know, this is only part
of what we can do for you,

26:09.025 --> 26:10.235
if you choose Femperial.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.444
I love it.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.988
Thank you so much.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.365
Let's go get a drink.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.702
Hi, everybody. Oh, my God.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.495
Thank you so much for coming.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.046
Adam. How'd everything go
with the drug test this afternoon?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.299
No news. Which is good news.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.883
Everyone passed with flying colors?

26:34.342 --> 26:36.094
You were expecting otherwise?

26:36.177 --> 26:38.138
No, no, I, uh, figured as much.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.850
Despite the fact
that PJ's been partying his ass off.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.019
So as a concerned owner,

26:44.519 --> 26:45.729
I tipped off the league.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.064
-That's why they tested him.
-You did what?

26:48.148 --> 26:51.026
I knew Blake would pull something
out of his bag of tricks

26:51.109 --> 26:52.736
to ensure PJ passed the test.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.070
Cute theory.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.364
PJ's clean and you have no proof.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.659
Except for the footage of you
swapping out PJ's urine sample

26:59.743 --> 27:01.202
behind Dr. Khan's back.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.789
I installed cameras in the offices,
including the conference rooms.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.916
For security, of course.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.836
That's an invasion of privacy.
A new low, even for you.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.588
Is that any way to treat family?

27:11.671 --> 27:13.965
Who do you think I learned it from?
It's classic Carrington.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.342
I'm sure you'll catch on.

27:15.925 --> 27:20.055
I'm gonna love hearing you explain this
to Commissioner Mills when he gets here.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.015
I sent him a copy of the video.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.184
The league is gonna force you out.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.729
And I'll be here to make sure this team
actually does something for the community.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.815
Enjoy the party while you can.

27:30.899 --> 27:31.941
Drinks on me.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.362
[Liam] Fallon, what the hell did you do?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.788
You hijacked my book event
to publicize another author?

27:44.871 --> 27:47.832
Well, it wasn't hard to notify your fans.
Both of them.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.002
And as far as the press is concerned,
they're here to cover a Femperial book,

27:51.086 --> 27:53.463
which hopefully hers will be very soon.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.548
-You are deplorable, Fallon.
-Thanks.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.510
Write about my savage business tactics
in your next book.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.428
But I won't publish that one either.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.438
[Jeff] Commissioner Mills.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.566
You know Atlantix majority owner,
Blake Carrington.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.736
You might wanna have
a little chat with him.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.862
Yes, I do.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.241
Blake, I love what you're doing
with the team.

28:21.825 --> 28:22.826
So impressed.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.703
I wish you all the best
on your inaugural season.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.998
Hold on.
Did you not see the video I sent you?

28:29.082 --> 28:29.916
Oh, that.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.836
Jeff, I appreciate your concerns,

28:32.919 --> 28:37.298
but we just didn't find sufficient
evidence of wrongdoing on the video

28:37.382 --> 28:38.466
without something concrete.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.052
He was tampering
with an official league drug test.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.929
How much more concrete can you get?

28:43.263 --> 28:46.474
[Roger] The video was blurry at best
and open to interpretation.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.728
The league knows that Blake
is an upstanding owner.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.229
[George] Hey, Jeff.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.856
You met Roger's son?

28:53.648 --> 28:54.649
This is Aiden.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.193
He's gonna be interning at the Atlantix,

28:57.277 --> 29:00.780
and he's interested in sports medicine
after he finishes school.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.284
It's beautiful when the next generation
finds its calling.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.869
[Jeff] Unbelievable.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.163
You really are a piece of work, Blake.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.790
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

29:10.874 --> 29:14.335
But I do owe Roger here a drink.
So, excuse us.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.506
Didn't know if you saw me
switch the samples,

29:18.590 --> 29:20.884
so I thought it couldn't hurt
to get ahead.

29:21.676 --> 29:22.594
Clever.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.263
But you might think
you're the favorite son now,

29:25.722 --> 29:27.474
but you're just Blake's new bitch.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.435
Either way, we still win.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.312
Game's not over yet, cousin.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.439
I just figured out

29:34.522 --> 29:37.192
whose office I'm gonna take. Yours.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.903
There's no reason for you to be
on the same floor with the owners.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.780
It seems like a small price to pay.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.246
It is the height of unprofessionalism

29:50.830 --> 29:53.833
that you used money and manpower
meant for me to promote her.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.877
Glo has a huge following.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.005
With limited resources, we needed to
impress her in the biggest way possible.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.757
By taking a giant dump on my career?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.008
Oh, it's just business.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.511
You expect me to believe that
with our history?

30:04.594 --> 30:07.430
You are going light years out of your way
to hurt me.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.849
It is obvious that this is just payback

30:09.933 --> 30:12.393
-for what that happened in Sun Valley.
-No.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.980
To say that it is payback would mean
I still care about us and I don't.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.025
I have moved on.
Why can't your staggering ego do the same?

30:19.734 --> 30:23.154
I wish you had the decency to at least
read my book first before you buried it.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.448
Oh, I read the book. Yeah.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.034
Cover to cover. And it's trash.

30:28.117 --> 30:31.037
Not even fun trash,
just garbage person trash.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.081
Wow.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.624
Got it. [chuckles]

30:35.583 --> 30:37.919
If you hate the book that much,
you don't have to publish it.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.879
Does that mean you're quitting?

30:40.171 --> 30:41.965
Yeah. Okay. Forget the book.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.550
Forget the money.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.886
You'll never have to see my face
ever again.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.054
You know, it's just...

30:48.137 --> 30:49.889
I just really thought that you...

30:51.683 --> 30:54.102
That you of all people
would've loved reading it.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.693
I think Glo Fest did the trick.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.575
Here's to another voice on the team
concerned about the community.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.536
You're lucky I even let you
past the bouncer.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.122
As far as the team,
what does it even matter?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.541
Blake's already greased
every palm in the city.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.878
The man can snake his way out of anything.

31:19.961 --> 31:23.798
I know firsthand how hard it is for Blake
to see anybody in a new light,

31:24.382 --> 31:25.842
but he gave me a shot.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.012
And I leveraged it and turned it into
a better position for myself.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.388
Is that what you think?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.516
I'm not his driver anymore.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.310
I got a seat at the big boy table.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.394
[chuckles]

31:36.477 --> 31:38.813
I have a say in what direction
this team goes.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.525
You're still doing his bidding.
Just at a slightly higher level.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.986
-Didn't you help him win this bid?
-Yeah.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.362
After our car accident,

31:46.446 --> 31:47.697
I offered to help him...

31:48.781 --> 31:50.742
as long as he helped me
get revenge on you.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.620
But then I had a change of heart.

31:53.703 --> 31:57.415
I told Blake to call the whole thing off,
but no, he refused.
He still had his goons steal
that 5 million from your mom's house.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.634
He plows through everyone.
He uses who he wants.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.013
And at some point, you're gonna
have to stop letting him use you.

32:19.854 --> 32:23.191
-Where's Freddie? It's cold out here.
-I called him 15 minutes ago.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.567
Isn't that your car?

32:27.654 --> 32:28.488
[Blake] Freddie.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.074
Freddie. Hey. What's wrong with you?

32:31.324 --> 32:32.241
Are you okay?

32:32.492 --> 32:33.701
[Cristal] What happened?

32:33.993 --> 32:34.827
I don't know.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.873
One minute I was up, and the next,
I just blacked out.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.542
What the hell is that?

32:41.626 --> 32:43.795
[Cristal] Oh, no. It's my family crest.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.713
It's a warning.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.465
Do you think they drugged him?

32:53.137 --> 32:54.305
So, how did tonight go?

32:54.889 --> 32:56.224
It depends on who you ask.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.810
Oh, so, not a success.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.354
I'm sorry.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.190
Blake is never gonna take me seriously
no matter how hard I work.

33:06.025 --> 33:08.111
I don't know how much longer I can play
by his rules.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.279
It's time to start breaking the rules.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.584
Did you talk to Fallon?

33:25.878 --> 33:26.713
I couldn't.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.049
We're in a really good place right now.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.052
Like, letting-me-borrow-clothes
good place.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.347
-I thought we were in a good place.
-I thought we were, too.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.307
Maybe we're making a mistake.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.226
By breaking the girl code?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.274
Maybe it's time
you start breaking some rules.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.026
[pop music playing on speakers]

34:12.382 --> 34:13.426
[Fallon] <i>Oh, my God.</i>

34:13.842 --> 34:16.012
Liam's book is about me.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.056
It's about us.

34:18.723 --> 34:23.268
And it's nice and it's sweet
and it's clever and it's amazing.

34:23.351 --> 34:24.228
And...

34:24.687 --> 34:27.106
I should've gone after him
when I had the chance.

34:28.524 --> 34:30.693
You think I still have time
to win him back?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.030
-Mom?
-[snoring]

34:35.031 --> 34:36.074
[cell phone beeps]

34:36.157 --> 34:37.074
[sighs]

34:40.411 --> 34:41.704
Are you kidding me?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.623
How two-faced can you get?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.630
I want this place fortified
like Fort Knox on steroids.

34:50.713 --> 34:53.925
Footstep detectors, fog blasts,
bullet and bomb-proof windows.

34:54.007 --> 34:56.469
No. Hell,
bullet and bomb-proof everything.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.596
I'll make the arrangements immediately.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.100
Not a waft of wind will get by that gate
without me knowing about it.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.978
I am sorry that I doubted you.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.980
But you have nothing to worry about.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.734
I will do everything in my power
to protect our family from yours.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.450
-Well, that worked better than I thought.
-Okay.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.245
Family crests are more of a Spanish thing,
not Mexican.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.497
-And that wasn't part of the plan.
-Yeah.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.290
I wanted to add dramatic flair.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.836
Blake doesn't know the difference
between Mexico and Spain anyway.
I do feel bad that I had to drug
Freddie with sleeping pills.

35:33.422 --> 35:36.342
<i>Ay,</i> no. Whatever, he caught up
on his rest. He'll be fine.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.719
At least Blake feels the threat now.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.930
Let's just hope it's enough.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.183
-Kirby here yet? No?
-She's--

35:44.267 --> 35:46.602
When she gets here, remind me
that my anger's at an eight.

35:46.686 --> 35:50.481
You might wanna dial it down to a four
because Glo's in your office.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.402
-How do I seem now?
-Like a seven?

35:54.777 --> 35:56.696
-No one asked you.
-You just--

35:57.822 --> 36:00.658
Gloria. Hi. Oh, so nice to see you.

36:00.741 --> 36:01.909
Would you like some Zen tea?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.911
I like to start my morning off
with a little Zen--

36:04.745 --> 36:06.122
Okay, that is not tea.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.165
Allison.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.376
Can I please have two Zen teas, hot?

36:12.003 --> 36:16.257
I just wanted to tell you in person
what a great time I had with my GiGi.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.634
We talked for hours, thanks to you.

36:18.718 --> 36:22.471
Well, that makes me very happy.
You two have a beautiful connection.

36:22.555 --> 36:26.309
She told me that it's been a dream of hers
to see me as a published author.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.686
Last night, she got to
see it happen, kind of.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.397
You mean because
you're not actually published yet?

36:31.480 --> 36:32.815
But I'm about to be.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.400
Where do I sign?

36:34.734 --> 36:37.528
I belong here, Fallon,
with your support and vision.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.988
Oh, my God.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.699
Oh, to the birth of a new fempire!

36:42.325 --> 36:43.326
Exactly.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.620
Us ladies need to stick together.

36:49.665 --> 36:50.499
[Culhane] Jeff.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.543
I was on my way to the office.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.003
I'm glad I caught you here.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.631
I can't stop thinking about how Blake
is playing us.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.590
Yeah. Well,

36:57.673 --> 37:00.176
the difference between us is
I'm gonna do something about it.

37:00.259 --> 37:03.262
I'm sending that video
to every media outlet in the country.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.806
If the team goes down,

37:05.890 --> 37:09.018
it's just an empty stadium and zero jobs
where your school's supposed to be.

37:10.019 --> 37:13.814
I asked Blake about a ten-million-dollar
gap in our development budget,

37:13.898 --> 37:15.900
which he said went to "investors."

37:15.983 --> 37:18.527
There are no investors. It's a sham.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.198
Like that company he sold the stadium land
to belonged to Cristal's father.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.660
He could be laundering money
through the team. And if he is,

37:25.743 --> 37:27.161
we can take that bastard down.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.830
I might have underestimated you.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.793
And Blake definitely underestimated
the two of us.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.339
I heard the good news about Glo.
Is it too early for rosé?

37:38.673 --> 37:40.841
Close the door. We need to talk.

37:41.509 --> 37:42.718
Is everything all right?

37:42.969 --> 37:45.221
You're... freaking me out.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.098
You wanna explain this?

37:51.644 --> 37:54.563
I promise I was gonna tell you, Fallon.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.481
Stop.

37:56.983 --> 37:57.858
I'm not mad.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.987
I have every right to be, but I am not.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.906
I am hurt that
you didn't tell me the truth.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.534
I thought we had evolved into something
resembling friends.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.535
We did.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.996
I really, truly wanted
to tell you, Fallon.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.081
I lost my nerve, which is unacceptable,

38:12.415 --> 38:15.626
but hopefully not unforgivable.
Our friendship means a lot to me.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.461
-Really?
-Yes.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.548
I should never have started anything
with Culhane

38:20.631 --> 38:23.884
and I will stop seeing him. I don't want
anyone getting in the way of us.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.345
Kirby, you can date
whoever you wanna date.

38:26.846 --> 38:27.888
Not Liam.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.600
But if we're gonna be friends,
you have to be honest with me.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.477
-Deal?
-Deal.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.062
Okay.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.026
If we're being honest...

38:41.402 --> 38:43.696
I think I should go
on the book tour with Glo.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.158
I found her, and, uh...

38:48.617 --> 38:50.244
I should see her through the finish line.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.247
You have a right to build
your own fempire, too.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.601
I was gonna go with Atlantix Yellow,

39:13.684 --> 39:15.895
but I decided to upgrade to Imperial Gold.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.647
-What do you think?
-That's above my pay grade.

39:18.856 --> 39:19.690
Clearly.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.942
Don't let me slow down your packing.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.945
I told the painters to get started
on my office in an hour.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.365
-Should be out of your hair by then.
-Good.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.284
I'll be sure to sage the place
as soon as you're gone.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.508
[knocking on door]

39:48.511 --> 39:49.470
[scoffs]

39:50.054 --> 39:53.641
You woke up in the middle of the night and
remembered something you hated about me?

39:53.724 --> 39:55.309
I lied when I said I'd read it.

39:55.976 --> 39:56.936
I hadn't.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.146
And then I did

39:59.438 --> 40:01.690
and I loved it,

40:02.441 --> 40:04.568
every page, every word.
It turns out
you're a very talented writer.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.740
I had some pretty great inspiration.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.784
And now I want to publish it.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.077
-Really?
-Really.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.371
Okay. Then I don't wanna use my pen name.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.165
If you really like it,
I wanna put my name on it.

40:18.916 --> 40:19.834
I'm proud of it.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.836
As long as no one knows I'm publisher.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.755
-Until it's a success, of course.
-Deal.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.007
Okay. We'll be working together.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.009
Ashley will be okay with that?

40:29.093 --> 40:31.720
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in weeks.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.640
[Cathedrals' "Hits Me
Like a Landslide" playing]

40:35.724 --> 40:36.559
[Fallon sighs]

40:36.642 --> 40:38.936
Hey. I'm, uh, glad you came around.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.856
At least now we can be civil
and professional

40:41.939 --> 40:43.816
and the rest of the process can be smooth.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.151
I do have notes.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.194
Of course. That's part of the process.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.367
She's a little wishy-washy.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.119
She should know exactly what she wants.

The deeper I got into the story,
I wasn't--

40:59.540 --> 41:01.292
I wasn't certain if she knew
what she wanted.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.711
I think she knows.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.006
What about the ending?
