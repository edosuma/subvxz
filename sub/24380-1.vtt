WEBVTT

00:01.726 --> 00:03.360
We can go to Gold Brothers Studios

00:03.362 --> 00:04.495
and audition for the "Locked" movie.

00:04.496 --> 00:06.497
You're seriously going
to that cattle call?

00:06.498 --> 00:07.599
You got the part.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.634
Oh, Paige,
this is gonna change your life.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.769
You know, the three of us would
spend all of our time together.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.438
We were inseparable.

00:13.439 --> 00:14.606
Kevin wrote out your parts.

00:14.607 --> 00:16.507
We no longer need your services.

00:16.508 --> 00:18.376
'Which is why we're letting you go.'

00:18.377 --> 00:20.612
My whole life, we've done it your way.

00:20.613 --> 00:23.481
Not anymore. You're fired!

00:23.482 --> 00:25.550
Let me show you
how much I want us to work.

00:25.551 --> 00:26.618
I can't.

00:26.619 --> 00:28.453
I can't be with someone I don't trust.

00:28.454 --> 00:30.788
I've stopped sleeping
with Nina. It's over.

00:30.789 --> 00:33.358
How could you deny him a chance
to know his dad?

00:33.359 --> 00:34.659
- 'It's him.'
- 'Alan Mills.'

00:34.660 --> 00:35.727
He's my father.

00:35.728 --> 00:38.662
You lied to me every day for 23 years.

00:40.466 --> 00:41.599
Have you been drinking?

00:41.600 --> 00:44.569
- Rainer, are you off the wagon?
- Rainer!

00:44.570 --> 00:46.371
Barrett Harper's been taunting me.

00:46.372 --> 00:47.572
He's going wide with the story

00:47.573 --> 00:48.740
about Alan being his father.

00:48.741 --> 00:50.408
What are you doing here?

00:52.645 --> 00:56.514
You're into him. I'm pretty sure
he's into you too.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.383
- I'm Rainer.
- Ah, yeah, I know.

00:58.384 --> 00:59.817
I thought you can wear it
on our first date.

00:59.818 --> 01:01.486
That's me asking you out.

01:01.487 --> 01:03.554
Paige, are you in fact
dating Rainer Devon?

01:03.555 --> 01:05.590
Don't answer that.

01:05.591 --> 01:07.625
I love you. I always have.

01:07.626 --> 01:09.627
'Are you with your
roommate or your co-star?'

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.555 --> 01:38.588
I love you.

01:56.542 --> 01:59.777
Baby, this is not
how you want this to end.

01:59.778 --> 02:01.745
I'm not your baby!

02:02.548 --> 02:04.682
You bitch!

02:16.628 --> 02:18.596
You two finally look good together.

02:29.708 --> 02:32.610
And, cut! That was great.
Till tighter.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.712
Are you sure you don't
wanna go one more time?

02:34.713 --> 02:36.414
I can be a badder badass.

02:36.415 --> 02:38.783
You were appropriately badass,
Cass. We're movin' on.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.551
'We need you in
the make-up chair, Cassie.'

02:42.621 --> 02:45.790
Hey, guys, I need a 15,
and get the, uh, POLA

02:45.791 --> 02:48.693
the ultra bounce too. Thank you.

02:48.694 --> 02:50.428
I have no idea what you said

02:50.429 --> 02:53.431
but you look all sexy
when you speak director.

02:53.432 --> 02:55.566
Do you mind if we take
a quick selfie in costume?

02:55.567 --> 02:56.733
Of course.

03:06.512 --> 03:08.613
I thought you wanted
to keep it a secret

03:08.614 --> 03:11.416
about us comin' out, would, you
know, make things complicated.

03:11.417 --> 03:12.750
We're in a really good place,
so I'm not worried

03:12.751 --> 03:14.385
about that anymore.

03:14.386 --> 03:16.421
Nothing's gonna screw us up, Paige.

03:16.422 --> 03:17.721
We're solid.

03:20.459 --> 03:22.626
We're losing light! Let's move!

03:33.705 --> 03:36.774
Holy crap, Paige!
What did you just post?

03:36.775 --> 03:38.709
A selfie with Jake.

03:38.710 --> 03:42.480
Hey, congratulations, Paige,
you're trending on Twitter.

03:42.481 --> 03:45.483
I guess you're right, Cass.
I gotta post more.

03:45.484 --> 03:47.851
Well, people aren't exactly
shipping you and Jake.

03:49.488 --> 03:52.390
- "Hashtag, Paige sucks."
- What the..

03:52.391 --> 03:55.560
- "Trending worldwide."
- Oh, my God.

03:55.561 --> 03:57.662
Why are people hating so much?

03:57.663 --> 03:59.896
Well, they just found out
you didn't pick Rainer.

04:25.624 --> 04:27.490
Hey, Rainer.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.727
Well, hello.

04:32.498 --> 04:35.500
Can you put some lotion on me?

04:37.603 --> 04:40.404
If you insist.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.578
Will you rub it in 'cause
I don't want it to streak.

04:53.352 --> 04:55.419
Like this?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.786
You know it's a little soft.

04:58.490 --> 05:02.326
Trust me. There's nothing soft
about me right now.

05:02.327 --> 05:06.496
Good. 'Cause I like
a long hard... massage.

05:08.467 --> 05:09.667
Rainer..

05:09.668 --> 05:12.402
...can I steal you away
from your activity?

05:14.306 --> 05:15.373
What's up?

05:15.374 --> 05:17.475
You've got visitors.

05:17.476 --> 05:19.542
It's time for you to pee in a cup.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.714
Meet me in my office.

05:23.715 --> 05:27.318
Is it just me or does he annoy
the shit out of you too?

05:27.319 --> 05:29.619
Everything about this place
annoys me, Rainman.

05:30.522 --> 05:32.522
It's rehab.

05:38.497 --> 05:40.665
This is beautiful.
Where do you think this is?

05:40.666 --> 05:42.767
Omaha! Who cares, Alan?

05:42.768 --> 05:44.702
So, he's agreed to see Alan again

05:44.703 --> 05:46.737
but he still refuses to meet with you.

05:46.738 --> 05:48.706
- Unacceptable.
- I tried.

05:48.707 --> 05:51.375
Look, I know my son.

05:51.376 --> 05:53.611
He's just overstaying in here
to punish me.

05:53.612 --> 05:55.780
He knows we can't finish
the movie without him.

05:55.781 --> 05:57.648
Nina, Rainer knows
he's ready to leave.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.517
And we agree,
he's on top of his sobriety

05:59.518 --> 06:00.751
but this choice is his to make. So..

06:00.752 --> 06:03.287
- Could you shut up?
- Wow.

06:03.288 --> 06:06.757
Just... for a minute. Please.

06:06.758 --> 06:10.494
- So I can think.
- Just one min.. Yeah, thanks.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.697
You think you can take out the guard?

06:12.698 --> 06:14.699
You're joking, right?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.767
Rainer needs to know that
if we don't resume production

06:16.768 --> 06:18.603
on "Locked" by Monday

06:18.604 --> 06:20.504
that you'll have no choice
but to pull the plug.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.708
And poof. Just like that
the movie goes away. For good.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.409
I will talk to him.

06:37.623 --> 06:40.491
So who.. Wait a minute,
your friend's boss

06:40.492 --> 06:42.360
literally got hit by a bus.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.362
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, on Robertson.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.564
She stepped out of her car
in front of the IV.

06:46.565 --> 06:47.765
Bus took the door off her Porsche

06:47.766 --> 06:49.400
and rolled over her foot.

06:49.401 --> 06:51.335
Oh, my God.

06:51.336 --> 06:53.471
So, is her foot, like, road kill or..

06:53.472 --> 06:54.772
- Cass?
- I didn't ask.

06:54.773 --> 06:57.408
No, the point is,
she can't go to Hawaii now

06:57.409 --> 06:58.776
and we can't borrow her house.

06:58.777 --> 07:01.345
It's okay, we'll figure out
another location

07:01.346 --> 07:02.613
to shoot tomorrow.

07:02.614 --> 07:04.681
'Oh, God. Here she comes.'

07:07.419 --> 07:10.354
Cap for you, drip
two shots of espresso

07:10.355 --> 07:13.290
and your usual latte,
light milk, extra foam.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.393
Thank you.

07:15.394 --> 07:19.463
Oh, and I saw your vagina
commercial on TV last night

07:19.464 --> 07:20.464
'during "Jeopardy."'

07:20.465 --> 07:21.499
You watch "Jeopardy?"

07:21.500 --> 07:22.700
Like, with your grandma?

07:22.701 --> 07:26.437
- Are you judging me?
- No, he-he's observing you.

07:26.438 --> 07:28.706
He-he's, he does that.
He's a filmmaker.

07:28.707 --> 07:30.574
They, that's what they do.
They observe.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.743
Oh, uh, so, um, the usual?

07:32.744 --> 07:34.612
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.313
Thank you.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.494
Hey, there's something about her
that's a little off.

07:39.551 --> 07:42.386
You think maybe she's an actress?

07:42.387 --> 07:44.689
- You think?
- Mmm, maybe.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.724
Paige, are you still getting hate?

07:46.725 --> 07:49.559
'Paige you need to
turn off your notifications.'

07:50.562 --> 07:52.462
What? I'm a GIF?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.500
Paige, you're seriously in the middle

07:56.501 --> 07:58.669
of your first social media shitstorm.

07:58.670 --> 07:59.737
It'll pass.

07:59.738 --> 08:01.706
You just gotta post a puppy picture.

08:01.707 --> 08:04.341
Hey, people love puppies.
I'll do it for you.

08:04.342 --> 08:06.310
What if it doesn't pass?

08:06.311 --> 08:08.546
I mean, what-what if "Locked" bombs

08:08.547 --> 08:10.548
or we don't even finish the movie?

08:10.549 --> 08:12.316
I mean, it's been two months already.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.518
What if Rainer's
never gets out of rehab?

08:14.519 --> 08:15.653
And then I'm just that random girl

08:15.654 --> 08:17.555
that won that part
in that big blockbuster

08:17.556 --> 08:18.756
that nobody will ever see?

08:18.757 --> 08:23.527
Paige, hey, you do have
something to fall back on.

08:23.528 --> 08:24.595
It's called "Stealing Georgia."

08:24.596 --> 08:26.330
I will piggyback on that.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.432
Look, I feel like this is meant to be

08:28.433 --> 08:29.767
for all of us.

08:29.768 --> 08:32.467
And, Jake, you're shooting
the hell out of this movie.

08:33.739 --> 08:36.307
It's true.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.775
And you're right.
You guys are both right.

08:37.775 --> 08:40.477
I think I've just had too much coffee.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.580
To "Stealing Georgia."

08:42.581 --> 08:44.415
- "Stealing Georgia."
- To "Stealing Georgia."

08:44.416 --> 08:46.417
Oh..

08:46.418 --> 08:48.419
I think you're good on coffee.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.720
You're a little jittery.

08:49.721 --> 08:51.622
Here.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.599
I tried therapy with my second wife.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.268
- How'd that go?
- She still hates me.

09:04.269 --> 09:06.704
But she forgave my third wife
for breaking up our marriage.

09:06.705 --> 09:09.340
If they all end badly,
why do you keep getting married?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.408
It makes them happy. Yeah.

09:11.409 --> 09:13.277
And it's no big deal
if they sign a prenup.

09:13.278 --> 09:14.677
Thanks for the fatherly advice.

09:16.281 --> 09:19.650
Right, ah, look, Rain
I hate to talk about work.

09:19.651 --> 09:20.651
So don't.

09:20.652 --> 09:23.287
Well, you know what's at stake, right?

09:23.288 --> 09:24.522
The movie's run out of insurance.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.424
Every day it's down,
the studio has to eat the cost.

09:27.425 --> 09:28.459
I can't hold out much longer.

09:28.460 --> 09:29.693
If I have to pull the plug on "Locked"

09:29.694 --> 09:32.596
your mother's career is dead.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.698
That's her problem.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.435
She thought
she was doing the right thing.

09:38.436 --> 09:40.504
I'm where I need to be.

09:40.505 --> 09:42.572
And that's never gonna be
on the set of "Locked."

09:44.776 --> 09:46.477
Yoga later?

09:46.478 --> 09:48.378
Namaste.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.618
Maybe I need to be in rehab.

10:00.711 --> 10:04.662
Jordan, your Golden Globe
speech had me feeling awful.

10:04.663 --> 10:06.797
I mean, I just wanted
to take you home that night.

10:06.798 --> 10:08.399
Girl, didn't we all?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.568
Yeah!

10:10.569 --> 10:11.735
I mean, hey, I'm available.

10:13.505 --> 10:14.772
'No, but seriously.'

10:14.773 --> 10:16.807
I'm being serious.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.809
Do we have a clip of that?

10:18.810 --> 10:20.644
Let's check it out.

10:20.645 --> 10:22.513
I lost..

10:22.514 --> 10:25.749
I lost both my parents
when I was a kid.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.884
So I didn't have anyone to look up to.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.556
I dedicate this to all the boys
and girls out there

10:32.557 --> 10:35.526
who are struggling.
If I can do it, you can too!

10:35.527 --> 10:37.795
Thank you! Thank you.

10:37.796 --> 10:41.432
Look at me, I'm like getting
emotional all over again.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.433
- Trying to keep my lashes...
- Okay, well..

10:42.434 --> 10:43.434
She's getting together.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.501
'I hear that there's some'

10:44.502 --> 10:46.370
'Oscar buzz rolling around.'

10:48.607 --> 10:50.708
Hey, it's a long shot,
but I'd be honored.

10:50.709 --> 10:53.777
Wow. Now, tell us about Rainer.
How's he doing?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.679
Well, you know,
it's no secret he's in rehab.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.448
You know, takin' some time
to work on himself.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.716
- Yeah.
- Uh, it's all good.

10:58.717 --> 11:00.351
Now what about "Locked?"

11:00.352 --> 11:02.419
Because rumor has it
with Rainer sill in treatment

11:02.420 --> 11:04.555
that they might shut down for good.

11:04.556 --> 11:06.523
Well, you know,
we all wanna go back to work.

11:06.524 --> 11:08.392
But we also want Rainer
to get healthy.

11:08.393 --> 11:09.460
That's the most important.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.527
'That's right.'

11:18.637 --> 11:21.772
'The verdict is in
for the sentencing of Eva Burns'

11:21.773 --> 11:23.540
'after pleading guilty to the murder'

11:23.541 --> 11:25.676
'of gossip guru Barrett Harper.'

11:25.677 --> 11:29.513
'Eva Burns has been sentenced
to a 25-year prison term.'

11:29.514 --> 11:32.449
'At time of the shooting, Burns
was the executive assistant'

11:32.450 --> 11:34.618
'to Hollywood producer, Nina Devon.'

11:34.619 --> 11:38.489
I had no idea that my assistant
was so unstable.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.792
Or that she had an obsession
with the victim.

11:41.793 --> 11:43.827
Brian, we did get
your fingerprints, right?

11:43.828 --> 11:46.730
All ten. You know I follow
the cast on social media, right?

11:46.731 --> 11:48.632
Why are you reminding me
of your job description?

11:48.633 --> 11:50.567
Paige posted a selfie
with her new boyfriend.

11:50.568 --> 11:51.669
I care because..

11:51.670 --> 11:53.504
It's the guy who interrupted
your press conference.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.925
They're making an indie together.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.443
- Get her in here. Today.
- I already left word.

11:59.444 --> 12:00.744
Then why are you still standing there?

12:00.745 --> 12:03.547
Why am I still standing here?

12:05.650 --> 12:07.651
- 'Hello.'
- Got a proposition for you.

12:07.652 --> 12:09.685
So proposition me.

12:23.582 --> 12:26.384
That is your contract.

12:26.385 --> 12:29.721
Did you even bother to read it
before you signed?

12:29.722 --> 12:32.522
Page 43. Read it.

12:35.394 --> 12:36.693
Out loud.

12:38.831 --> 12:41.366
"Under terms of this agreement

12:41.367 --> 12:44.502
client is exclusive to
Gold Brothers Studios."

12:44.503 --> 12:45.737
Did I give you permission

12:45.738 --> 12:48.439
to shoot a crappy indie
with your boyfriend?

12:48.440 --> 12:49.707
It's called "Stealing Georgia."

12:49.708 --> 12:51.609
And I think that
if you read it, you'd...

12:51.610 --> 12:54.379
If you don't cease
and desist immediately

12:54.380 --> 12:55.580
I will have the movie shut down.

12:55.581 --> 12:58.616
And also I'll make sure
it never sees the light of day.

12:58.617 --> 13:00.585
I've been out of work for two months

13:00.586 --> 13:01.753
a-and "Locked" isn't even shooting.

13:01.754 --> 13:03.588
Why are you doing this?

13:03.589 --> 13:05.323
Because I own you.

13:05.324 --> 13:08.326
And I'm very protective
of my investments.

13:08.327 --> 13:09.494
Is this about Rainer?

13:09.495 --> 13:11.496
I asked you to look after him.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.498
And I've tried to do so.

13:13.499 --> 13:16.334
What, by posting pictures
of your bae on Instagram?

13:16.335 --> 13:18.435
By visiting Rainer in rehab.

13:19.505 --> 13:21.439
- Well, you've seen him?
- No.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.740
But I've, I've tried.

13:22.741 --> 13:25.510
He won't put me on the list.

13:25.511 --> 13:29.680
Nina, I'm sorry that Jake
interrupted the press conference

13:29.681 --> 13:33.651
and I really appreciate
that you got us out of there

13:33.652 --> 13:36.754
before any reporters had
a chance to put me on the spot.

13:36.755 --> 13:39.390
Well, your apologies usually
come with a but. So, what is it?

13:39.391 --> 13:41.626
Nothing. There's no buts.

13:41.627 --> 13:43.528
And, by the way

13:43.529 --> 13:45.630
Jake and I only started dating

13:45.631 --> 13:46.798
after Rainer was in rehab.

13:46.799 --> 13:49.367
And I went to Malibu
to go explain that to him

13:49.368 --> 13:50.835
and he refused to see me.

13:50.836 --> 13:54.571
Well, he shut me out before,
but never for this long.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.778
When Rain talks about you..

14:00.779 --> 14:04.681
I mean, even when he's upset,
he gets this look on his face.

14:07.386 --> 14:09.619
He's really proud to be your son.

14:10.522 --> 14:12.489
Well, thank you for that.

14:13.525 --> 14:15.793
But don't think this changes anything.

14:15.794 --> 14:18.595
I'm still pulling the plug
on your movie.

14:20.466 --> 14:21.698
We're done.

14:33.445 --> 14:35.480
'That was
Tangey Turner's "Heart Eyes."'

14:35.481 --> 14:37.782
'Taking us back to the time
when she was on top.'

14:37.783 --> 14:39.750
'Can the one hit wonder country
singer come back'

14:39.751 --> 14:42.420
'from her latest album's epic fail?'

14:54.666 --> 14:55.733
'It's Alexis.'

14:55.734 --> 14:57.502
'I'm busy being fabulous'

14:57.503 --> 14:58.603
'so leave it at the beep.'

14:58.604 --> 15:01.471
Call me. I need some friend time.

15:03.475 --> 15:06.643
I hope you get hit by a bus,
you piece of crap!

15:08.313 --> 15:09.546
Jackass.

15:10.415 --> 15:12.450
'Perfect!'

15:12.451 --> 15:13.618
- Let's do it one more time!
- Wait.

15:13.619 --> 15:15.486
If it was perfect,
why are we doing it again?

15:15.487 --> 15:18.322
Because I'm the producer
and I know what I'm doin'.

15:18.323 --> 15:19.390
Check it.

15:19.391 --> 15:21.526
This week's ratings are even higher

15:21.527 --> 15:22.627
than the premier.

15:22.628 --> 15:24.245
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

15:24.246 --> 15:26.222
Alexilicious is a bonafide hit.

15:26.331 --> 15:29.500
And you are the reigning queen
of reality TV.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.335
I gotta give you props, Ida.

15:31.336 --> 15:32.570
When you first came to me
with this, I thought

15:32.571 --> 15:34.405
you were offering me Tangey's seconds.

15:34.406 --> 15:36.374
I was, but she passed

15:36.375 --> 15:37.742
and you had nowhere to go but up.

15:37.743 --> 15:40.444
And that's exactly
where I'm taking you.

15:40.445 --> 15:42.680
Fallon, Kimmel, Ellen..

15:42.681 --> 15:44.682
They all want you.

15:44.683 --> 15:46.350
Thank you, Ida.

15:47.519 --> 15:48.753
Now, get back in there and insult

15:48.754 --> 15:50.555
your fake date like you mean it.

15:50.556 --> 15:52.356
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

15:52.357 --> 15:53.624
Okay, listen, she's gonna
smack you this time, okay?

15:53.625 --> 15:54.792
Try that.

15:54.793 --> 15:56.593
This one's perfect.

15:57.763 --> 15:59.597
It's not available either.

15:59.598 --> 16:02.300
Let's face it, we're never gonna
find the location by tomorrow.

16:02.301 --> 16:03.566
Okay. Um..

16:05.404 --> 16:06.704
Uh, I.. We already ordered.

16:06.705 --> 16:09.407
You think you're so special?

16:09.408 --> 16:11.442
- Well, you're not.
- Excuse me?

16:11.443 --> 16:12.743
You're average.

16:12.744 --> 16:14.645
Just like everyone else
in that pathetic

16:14.646 --> 16:17.315
little bubble you call your life.

16:17.316 --> 16:20.318
You know what,
you judge people like me

16:20.319 --> 16:21.652
because it's easier
than facing the fact

16:21.653 --> 16:23.421
that your life is mediocre.

16:23.422 --> 16:25.689
It's meaningless and you know it.

16:28.594 --> 16:30.328
Well?

16:30.329 --> 16:31.762
You were totally believable.

16:31.763 --> 16:33.664
You left your script behind
and it's the best

16:33.665 --> 16:36.767
I've read all year.
I'd love to be part of it.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.703
The movie's already cast.

16:38.704 --> 16:42.506
- 'Vera, order up.'
- Alright!

16:42.507 --> 16:45.709
Well, maybe you'll remember
me for the next one.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.616
Okay. That was... scary.

16:51.617 --> 16:53.718
She can make an emotional
turn on a dime.

16:53.719 --> 16:56.387
Oh, my God.
Back to our location issue.

16:56.388 --> 16:58.723
- I figured it out.
- What?

16:58.724 --> 17:00.557
Paige needs to buy a house.

17:01.693 --> 17:04.428
Unfortunately,
Nina's right about this one.

17:04.429 --> 17:06.564
You're exclusive to "Locked"
until the film's completion.

17:06.565 --> 17:08.366
But Rainer is still in rehab...

17:08.367 --> 17:10.667
You don't wanna burn bridges
this early in your career.

17:10.669 --> 17:12.603
Actually, I pulled up Paige's contract

17:12.604 --> 17:14.739
and there are a few loopholes
we could explore

17:14.740 --> 17:17.340
without her stepping on anyone's toes.

17:17.342 --> 17:19.676
Hey, Joanie, could you make
a coffee run?

17:19.678 --> 17:21.779
I'll take a double soy matcha latte.

17:21.780 --> 17:25.782
U-uh, yeah. Yeah..
Can I get you something?

17:25.784 --> 17:28.719
Uh, no. Thank you.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.788
So, if you'll just trust us
on this one...

17:30.789 --> 17:32.523
It's my turn to interrupt.

17:32.524 --> 17:35.526
Um, is Joanie an agent
or an assistant?

17:35.527 --> 17:36.727
She's an agent. Uh..

17:36.728 --> 17:38.362
We thought you'd appreciate having

17:38.363 --> 17:39.697
a woman on your team.

17:39.698 --> 17:42.566
Yeah. That's a good idea.

17:42.567 --> 17:43.734
You're all fired.

17:46.438 --> 17:48.538
You can show yourselves out.

17:50.809 --> 17:53.477
I mean, why doesn't
Bob get the coffee?

17:53.478 --> 17:56.447
Or Jim, or that weasel, Andy,
who for some reason can't not

17:56.448 --> 17:57.782
stare at my boobs
every time he talks to me?

17:57.783 --> 17:59.517
It's not that hard.
These are my boobs.

17:59.518 --> 18:01.519
These are my eyes. Boobs. Eyes.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.688
Uh.. Don't think that they're
doing you any favors, Paige.

18:03.689 --> 18:06.724
The agency's only looking out
for Nina, Alan, and the man.

18:06.725 --> 18:08.726
They could care less about you.
They're in bed with the studio.

18:08.727 --> 18:10.361
They always have been.

18:10.362 --> 18:12.396
- 'Jason.'
- Ugh, Jason.

18:12.397 --> 18:14.365
Oh, my God! Jason,
why is he even an agent?

18:14.366 --> 18:16.734
He just sits on his phone
and plays Candy Crush all day.

18:16.735 --> 18:18.736
And his assistant, my friend Angela

18:18.737 --> 18:20.371
does all the work for him.

18:20.372 --> 18:22.573
I keep telling her
she should bail, but..

18:22.574 --> 18:24.408
You know, I don't wanna
do this anymore.

18:24.409 --> 18:25.742
I-I quit.

18:27.546 --> 18:30.381
Good for you. I think you made
the right decision.

18:30.382 --> 18:32.516
Thanks. Yeah, thanks for listening.

18:32.517 --> 18:34.752
- You were really helpful.
- You're welcome.

18:34.753 --> 18:36.654
Uh..

18:36.655 --> 18:39.490
Good luck with everything, Paige.

18:39.491 --> 18:40.824
I believe in you.

18:43.328 --> 18:44.729
Hey..

18:44.730 --> 18:47.397
Why do you believe in me?

18:48.767 --> 18:50.867
'Cause I can tell you want it
as badly as I do.

18:52.804 --> 18:54.605
I'm looking for a new agent.

18:54.606 --> 18:55.872
I'm available.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.443
Okay, so tell me about these loopholes

18:59.444 --> 19:00.478
you've been talking about.

19:00.479 --> 19:01.678
Okay.

19:18.119 --> 19:19.994
Look, the studio
can only get behind one actor

19:19.995 --> 19:22.463
and we're pushing Matt Damon
for the Oscar this year.

19:22.464 --> 19:24.632
- Seriously, Damon?
- Have you seen his performance?

19:24.633 --> 19:27.301
Yeah, Jordan put on 20 pounds
of muscle.

19:27.302 --> 19:29.570
Damon, he put on a fat suit
and a bald cap.

19:29.571 --> 19:31.205
- He shaved his head.
- Fat suit.

19:31.206 --> 19:34.241
- Please.
- Alan, I'm your guy this year.

19:34.242 --> 19:37.311
You give me the support and I
will 24/7 earn that nomination.

19:37.312 --> 19:38.646
What, you're always preaching
that everybody likes

19:38.647 --> 19:41.282
a feel-good story?
Have you heard Jordan's?

19:41.283 --> 19:42.650
- It's a happy ending.
- Ah, you would know.

19:42.651 --> 19:45.386
- Alan!
- Oh, w-wait, he knows about us?

19:45.387 --> 19:47.621
Look, you know what,
don't sweat it. Really, don't.

19:47.622 --> 19:50.291
I've kept bigger secrets than
an Autumn-Spring time affair.

19:50.292 --> 19:51.525
Don't get me wrong..

19:51.526 --> 19:53.227
Still physically, still summer.

19:53.228 --> 19:54.495
Oh, thanks for the qualification.

19:54.496 --> 19:56.363
Look, I really want this.

19:56.364 --> 19:59.332
Jordan is the real deal, Alan.
He's a winner.

20:00.535 --> 20:02.469
Okay, alright. Let me,
let me see what I can do.

20:02.470 --> 20:04.471
Thank you.

20:04.472 --> 20:06.606
Now, I gotta go kiss Tarantino's ass.

20:10.612 --> 20:13.347
- You told him about us?
- Don't worry about Alan.

20:13.348 --> 20:15.282
I know where all his skeletons
are buried.

20:15.283 --> 20:16.350
Tangey knows, Alan knows.

20:16.351 --> 20:17.518
You don't think
Rainer's gonna find out?

20:17.519 --> 20:18.686
No. I don't.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.454
I've told that made-up story
about my parents

20:20.455 --> 20:22.523
so many times, it almost feels real.

20:22.524 --> 20:24.658
Then I remember, the only part
that's not fiction

20:24.659 --> 20:26.493
is how Rainer's like a brother to me.

20:26.494 --> 20:28.662
And I'm glad he has you.

20:28.663 --> 20:30.631
I wanna tell Rainer the truth about us

20:30.632 --> 20:32.266
while he's in a safe place.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.435
You listen to me.

20:34.436 --> 20:35.602
Rainer is still not talking to me

20:35.603 --> 20:40.307
and if you dump this on him now,
he will never forgive me.

20:40.308 --> 20:42.309
And if he finds out about it
from someone else, Nina

20:42.310 --> 20:43.610
he's gonna hate both of us.

20:43.611 --> 20:44.645
Jordan!

20:53.254 --> 20:55.389
'Breathe again.'

20:55.390 --> 20:58.559
'Breathe. Breathe deeply.'

20:58.560 --> 21:01.261
'Do Chaturanga.'

21:01.262 --> 21:03.597
'And Cobra.'

21:03.598 --> 21:05.532
'Hold.'

21:05.533 --> 21:08.602
'Push back into downward dog.'

21:08.603 --> 21:10.504
'Hold.'

21:10.505 --> 21:11.638
'Breathe.'

21:11.639 --> 21:13.739
'And back to Cobra.'

21:23.385 --> 21:24.551
Psst. Hey!

21:24.552 --> 21:26.320
Does this do anything for you?

21:29.457 --> 21:32.659
- Impressive.
- No. Making gains.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.627
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.

21:36.297 --> 21:38.298
The coast is clear.

21:38.299 --> 21:39.599
What?

21:42.303 --> 21:44.538
You know we can't do this.

21:44.539 --> 21:46.306
Do what?

21:46.307 --> 21:49.376
We're about to kiss, and you
know that's not allowed here.

21:49.377 --> 21:51.678
Oh. You never break the rules.

21:51.679 --> 21:53.580
It's not that I don't want to

21:53.581 --> 21:55.781
but I wanna do rehab right this time.

21:57.485 --> 21:58.751
I get it.

21:59.554 --> 22:01.522
Thank you.

22:01.523 --> 22:03.490
But we're still playing cards later?

22:03.491 --> 22:06.527
I'll find you... after
I take a cold shower.

22:06.528 --> 22:10.296
Okay. Well, I'm gonna take
raincheck on that kiss.

22:11.399 --> 22:13.299
I'm ready when you are.

22:17.539 --> 22:19.573
You do know
there is room service, right?

22:19.574 --> 22:23.410
Yeah, and I refuse to let you
pay $20 for a bottle of water.

22:23.411 --> 22:25.312
Wait, so you just hired her
on the spot?

22:25.313 --> 22:28.315
- Just like Jerry Maguire.
- "Show me the money."

22:28.316 --> 22:30.317
Even though Joanie found

22:30.318 --> 22:32.352
an element of my exclusivity clause

22:32.353 --> 22:34.321
uh, she still thinks
that we should shoot

22:34.322 --> 22:35.322
"Stealing Georgia" on the down-low

22:35.323 --> 22:37.357
'cause why rattle Nina's cage?

22:37.358 --> 22:39.426
Oh, good, it's on TV again.

22:39.427 --> 22:41.567
'Oh, my God. Wait, hold on.
Let me turn up.'

22:44.499 --> 22:47.534
Vaginal dryness should
not be embarrassing to talk about.

22:47.535 --> 22:48.602
But it is.

22:48.603 --> 22:51.438
That's why Vagihydrate
is now available

22:51.439 --> 22:52.606
'without a doctor's prescription.'

22:52.607 --> 22:54.508
'Side effects include nausea'

22:54.509 --> 22:56.610
'vomiting, bloating, stomach cramps'

22:56.611 --> 22:59.246
'breast pain tenderness,
and/or swelling'

22:59.247 --> 23:00.514
'headache, weight changes, freckles'

23:00.515 --> 23:02.316
'or darkening of facial skin'

23:02.317 --> 23:04.351
'loss of scalp hair
and vaginal discharge.'

23:04.352 --> 23:06.320
increases sex, nervousness, dizziness

23:06.321 --> 23:07.354
or tired feeling.

23:07.355 --> 23:08.422
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.524
- Yeah!
- Ka-ching, Cass.

23:10.525 --> 23:12.659
I've seen it, like, three times today.

23:12.660 --> 23:15.562
Guy at the market called me
"Itchy-vag girl."

23:15.563 --> 23:17.664
You're a celebrity now.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.634
Oh, it's Adam.

23:20.635 --> 23:23.370
Hey, baby.

23:23.371 --> 23:26.340
Are you sure about this idea
for the shoot tomorrow?

23:26.341 --> 23:30.210
I just feel like it's, it's a
little crazy. Even for us.

23:30.211 --> 23:32.446
It'll be a great story
to tell at Sundance.

23:32.447 --> 23:35.314
I love how you know
this is gonna happen for us.

23:36.684 --> 23:39.319
I love how you eat a whole
Cup Of Noodles in two bites.

23:40.522 --> 23:41.688
- You want some?
- Yeah.

23:41.689 --> 23:44.558
- Mm, no.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

23:44.559 --> 23:45.692
Is that what you want to play? Really?

23:45.693 --> 23:47.227
- That's how I wanna play.
- Yeah, give me some.

23:47.228 --> 23:48.428
I'm real bad.

23:58.473 --> 24:01.174
Ooh, come in, Kendall and Kylie.

24:01.175 --> 24:03.410
I hope you're hungry..

24:03.411 --> 24:05.445
This's my best friend, Tangey Turner.

24:05.446 --> 24:09.449
Ooh, um, I thought this was
a girls' night, for just us.

24:09.450 --> 24:13.220
It is a girls' night.
But my life is an open book now.

24:13.221 --> 24:15.289
I don't want to
keep anything from my fans.

24:15.290 --> 24:16.623
I want them to know the real me.

24:16.624 --> 24:21.261
Which is why we are in
"Alexilicious" family forever.

24:21.262 --> 24:24.364
Alexis, you are amazing.
You're too perfect.

24:24.365 --> 24:28.268
Let's do some touch-ups and then
relight for her confessional.

24:28.269 --> 24:30.504
Wait, was-was this rehearsed?

24:30.505 --> 24:32.472
Okay, I didn't sign up
to be on this show.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.241
I'm not signing a waiver.

24:34.242 --> 24:35.409
It's not like, this was
a set-up or anything

24:35.410 --> 24:38.612
we just ran long
and we're not done yet.

24:38.613 --> 24:40.547
Enjoy the fish, but I heard
they're bones in it

24:40.548 --> 24:41.648
so my mama should try it first.

24:41.649 --> 24:43.684
Alexis' miked, Tangey. I heard that.

24:43.685 --> 24:45.419
We can still hang out.

24:45.420 --> 24:47.387
I just don't have enough footage
for my next episode.

24:47.388 --> 24:50.223
So, it needs to be on camera.

24:50.224 --> 24:53.393
I am so happy for you, Lex.
I really am.

24:53.394 --> 24:56.296
But I passed on "Tangeylicious"
because I don't want my life

24:56.297 --> 24:57.497
playing out in front of the world.

24:57.498 --> 24:59.700
Well, that was your mistake
and my gain.

24:59.701 --> 25:02.169
I don't want to be part of this.

25:02.170 --> 25:05.205
Girl, you just need to stop
trying to punish me

25:05.206 --> 25:06.607
with your career choices.

25:06.608 --> 25:09.643
You need to grow up and start
makin' some wise-ass decisions.

25:09.644 --> 25:11.345
Believe it or not, mama,
but you are not

25:11.346 --> 25:12.646
the motivator of my choices.

25:12.647 --> 25:14.181
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

25:14.182 --> 25:16.249
Okay, "Alexilicious" is sponsoring

25:16.250 --> 25:18.452
the new nightclub
at the Bixby tomorrow.

25:18.453 --> 25:20.654
Let's go, we could tear
the place up together.

25:20.655 --> 25:23.624
Ugh, to the Bixby,
the hotel's already incestuous.

25:23.625 --> 25:24.658
Really? Do tell.

25:24.659 --> 25:26.326
Half Hollywood is staying there

25:26.327 --> 25:27.561
including your least favorite, Ginger.

25:27.562 --> 25:30.297
Oh, did you see that
corn-fed nobody posted a pic

25:30.298 --> 25:31.632
with her new bae, Jay.

25:31.633 --> 25:33.634
- Jealous much?
- Ooh, ooh.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.569
That's some good stuff,
save it for the cameras.

25:35.570 --> 25:38.238
I know you're down,
so come out with me tomorrow

25:38.239 --> 25:40.674
walk the red carpet, your fans
will fawn all over you.

25:40.675 --> 25:43.443
Pablo Money is performing.

25:43.444 --> 25:46.380
Can we come back here after
without all the..

25:46.381 --> 25:48.315
- Yes, I promise.
- Okay, come here.

25:48.316 --> 25:49.549
Yay!

25:49.550 --> 25:51.585
- Yes.
- Alright, bye.

25:51.586 --> 25:53.587
Bye.

25:53.588 --> 25:55.489
How'd you swing Pablo Money?

25:55.490 --> 25:58.425
She's got a great manager,
like you used to have.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.395
- Come on, bae.
- Okay.

26:01.396 --> 26:03.229
Good luck.

26:08.954 --> 26:10.722
- 'Hey, I'm James.'
- 'Hey.'

26:10.723 --> 26:12.724
'You're on the show,
"Million Dollar Listing."'

26:12.725 --> 26:15.593
So nice to meet you. Check this out.

26:15.594 --> 26:16.894
Oh, wow!

26:16.895 --> 26:20.498
It's a small house, so you can
operate every light, appliance

26:20.499 --> 26:24.002
TV, music, all from your phone,
watch this.

26:24.003 --> 26:26.771
- Oh, that's so cool!
- Isn't that cool?

26:26.772 --> 26:29.574
You can literally
turn on the coffee maker

26:29.575 --> 26:30.842
whilst you're lounging
in bed with Jake.

26:30.843 --> 26:31.943
Wait, what?

26:31.944 --> 26:33.578
Uh, how do you know about Jake?

26:33.579 --> 26:35.880
- "Hashtag Paige sucks."
- Awesome.

26:35.881 --> 26:37.615
Just wait until you see the views

26:37.616 --> 26:39.817
and prepare to
lose your breath for a bit.

26:39.818 --> 26:41.985
Wow, I'm-I'm I'm excited now.

26:44.857 --> 26:46.758
It's incredible.

26:50.863 --> 26:52.929
I thought we brought the 416.

27:03.742 --> 27:07.712
Yo, Rainer, how do you feel?

27:07.713 --> 27:10.681
- Feeling stronger every day.
- You look good, man.

27:10.682 --> 27:12.917
Maybe it's all that green
they push on you in here.

27:12.918 --> 27:14.585
Thanks, Grace.

27:14.586 --> 27:15.787
It's no joke, Jay.

27:15.788 --> 27:17.555
Every time you eat
or drink, you're either

27:17.556 --> 27:19.824
feeding the disease or fighting it.

27:19.825 --> 27:23.528
Alright, alright.
You bored of this place yet?

27:23.529 --> 27:25.830
Uh, it beats dealing with
the liars outside this place.

27:25.831 --> 27:27.665
Oh, you mean your mom?

27:27.666 --> 27:28.966
You know, this is the longest
I've ever gone

27:28.967 --> 27:30.935
without talking to her.

27:30.936 --> 27:35.540
I gotta be honest.
I've never felt more like me.

27:35.541 --> 27:38.609
In here, I'm not her son,
I'm not her client.

27:38.610 --> 27:41.711
I'm just... uh, Rainer.

27:42.848 --> 27:44.881
I don't think she meant to hurt you.

27:46.518 --> 27:48.853
- Are you here to defend her?
- No.

27:48.854 --> 27:52.590
Did she ask you to convince me
to go back to "Locked?"

27:52.591 --> 27:54.525
- Dude, relax..
- You know what? We're done.

27:54.526 --> 27:56.860
Come on, Rain.
Forget I even brought it up.

28:03.569 --> 28:05.536
I'm sorry, man, I just..

28:05.537 --> 28:07.939
You have to understand
what she took from me.

28:07.940 --> 28:10.508
I grew up without a dad.

28:10.509 --> 28:11.808
I get it. Okay?

28:14.780 --> 28:16.814
Of course you do.

28:16.815 --> 28:18.883
This is insane.

28:18.884 --> 28:21.519
There's something about
being in the hills

28:21.520 --> 28:22.753
that just speaks to people.

28:22.754 --> 28:25.656
You know, you're a part of
the city, but at the same time

28:25.657 --> 28:28.559
you're a little removed
from all the chaos.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.895
Okay, so you're thirsty
for Georgia's blood

28:30.896 --> 28:33.898
and the gun is
the instrument of death, okay?

28:33.899 --> 28:36.701
Alright.

28:36.702 --> 28:38.702
And action.

28:43.876 --> 28:45.710
Put it down.

28:45.711 --> 28:47.711
'Pick up the photo.'

28:48.580 --> 28:49.747
Little closer. Closer.

28:49.748 --> 28:51.916
We had it all, and then
she rides up looking like

28:51.917 --> 28:53.951
a red hot mess and you take the bait.

28:53.952 --> 28:55.685
Yeah, now put it down.

28:56.622 --> 28:58.622
Pull the cover up.

28:59.691 --> 29:02.559
'Slowly, slowly, and walk.'

29:05.464 --> 29:06.797
I'm gonna kill that bitch!

29:06.798 --> 29:08.766
Crap.

29:08.767 --> 29:11.635
Oh. Welcome to the open house.

29:12.804 --> 29:13.970
Uh..

29:15.507 --> 29:18.709
That was weird.
Uh, let's go wider. Now.

29:21.613 --> 29:24.681
'It's so peaceful. Can
we not rush back inside?'

29:27.853 --> 29:29.886
Actually, let's look at the kitchen.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.959
I hate that the paparazzi forced
you out of your apartment.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.863
But someone like you really
needs to be in a gated home.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.731
And I worked with a lot of celebrities

29:40.732 --> 29:43.501
and we always put
their security first.

29:43.502 --> 29:44.869
Well, that's why I'm at the Bixby.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.772
Paige, with interest rates
so low and a 20% down

29:47.773 --> 29:49.740
your mortgage payments here
would be lower

29:49.741 --> 29:52.510
than a week's bill at your hotel.

29:52.511 --> 29:55.613
- Seriously?
- It's a gem of a house.

29:55.614 --> 29:58.716
You said you watch my show, so
you know I'm a straight-shooter

29:58.717 --> 30:00.685
it's priced to sell.

30:00.686 --> 30:02.920
Okay, well, I can't wait
to see the upstairs.

30:02.921 --> 30:04.956
'Wait until you see
the master bathroom.'

30:04.957 --> 30:06.791
It's to die for.

30:06.792 --> 30:09.726
- Is there a tub?
- Wait until you see it.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.801
Your assistant said you were
in an important meeting.

30:16.802 --> 30:18.603
So, you just barged in here anyway?

30:18.604 --> 30:19.936
Yeah, well, it is my studio.

30:21.573 --> 30:23.541
Okay, okay, when are you gonna
get off that thing?

30:23.542 --> 30:25.710
Never! It's the only thing
I can control.

30:25.711 --> 30:27.612
Nina, we need to talk.

30:27.613 --> 30:29.779
I'm a multitasker.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.719
It's important.

30:36.755 --> 30:38.956
How much time do I have?

30:38.957 --> 30:41.559
I called a board meeting
for tomorrow to let them know

30:41.560 --> 30:43.561
I'm going to pull
the plug on "Locked."

30:43.562 --> 30:45.630
I'm gonna forgo my bonus,
hopefully that will stop

30:45.631 --> 30:46.897
the bleeding from me.

30:46.898 --> 30:50.601
So, I'm the one getting fired?

30:50.602 --> 30:52.036
I'm gonna fight for you.

30:52.037 --> 30:55.673
But someone has to take
the blame for this.

30:55.674 --> 30:58.742
Well, I guess it'd rather
be me than Rainer.

31:09.606 --> 31:12.642
I need to talk to you in there.

31:12.643 --> 31:14.810
Okay. What did I do?

31:14.811 --> 31:16.745
I thought we were gonna be..

31:19.616 --> 31:20.783
Why'd you change your mind?

31:20.784 --> 31:23.486
My doctor said I'm ready
to leave, so I checked out.

31:23.487 --> 31:25.147
Technically,
I'm not breaking any rules.

31:26.456 --> 31:28.423
But I am.

31:29.826 --> 31:32.560
- Do you care?
- Nah.

31:51.548 --> 31:54.583
'Paige, over here! Look this way.'

31:54.584 --> 31:57.820
'Hey, Paige! Can I get one
with just you and Jake?'

31:57.821 --> 32:00.723
Paige, is it true
you broke Rainer's heart?

32:00.724 --> 32:02.792
'Paige, over here. Look this way.'

32:02.793 --> 32:05.461
Okay, okay, uh, that's enough.
That's enough.

32:05.462 --> 32:07.396
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
Come on, come on.

32:07.397 --> 32:09.632
'Paige, is it true
you broke Rainer's heart?'

32:12.335 --> 32:15.337
I'm Cassandra Perkins with two S's.

32:15.338 --> 32:17.339
You know, maybe you've seen
my commercial?

32:17.340 --> 32:18.507
I don't actually use the product.

32:18.508 --> 32:20.608
- 'Cassie?'
- Okay. Um, bye.

32:22.579 --> 32:25.513
Alexis, you're looking
beautiful. Over here, please?

32:27.384 --> 32:29.784
'Alexis, can we
get of you without Tangey?'

32:31.521 --> 32:32.822
- 'Tangey.'
- 'Over here.'

32:32.823 --> 32:36.459
'Jordan, Tangey. Over here!'

32:36.460 --> 32:38.726
- 'Jordan, over here!'
- 'Over here.'

32:40.430 --> 32:42.498
Wanna walk the carpet together?

32:42.499 --> 32:43.765
Stir the pot.

32:45.569 --> 32:48.570
I don't think that's the kind
of publicity I want.

32:51.775 --> 32:53.476
Okay.

33:25.342 --> 33:26.709
Hey.

33:26.710 --> 33:28.511
- Hey.
- Can I steal you for a minute?

33:28.512 --> 33:29.644
Yeah.

33:30.714 --> 33:33.516
So, I was talking to
the editor of "Us Weekly"

33:33.517 --> 33:35.584
I interned for her when I was at
Columbia, she loved your story

33:35.585 --> 33:36.819
and the challenges
of overnight stardom

33:36.820 --> 33:38.788
and she thinks that you would
make the perfect cover

33:38.789 --> 33:41.624
for their special
"Young Hollywood" issue.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.392
Oh, my God.

33:43.393 --> 33:45.528
Me on the cover of "Us." That's..

33:45.529 --> 33:47.630
Wait, wait, what?
How did you swing that?

33:47.631 --> 33:49.632
I promised her that
when "Locked" comes out

33:49.633 --> 33:51.534
remember it was "Us"
that gave you your first cover.

33:51.535 --> 33:53.702
Plus, I showed her
the comments on your Instafeed.

33:53.703 --> 33:55.504
- "Hashtag Paige sucks?"
- Yeah.

33:55.505 --> 33:57.406
Right now you're famous
for being famous.

33:57.407 --> 33:58.440
And that's our angle on you,

33:58.441 --> 33:59.441
but when "Locked" comes out...

33:59.442 --> 34:00.376
If "Locked" comes out..

34:00.377 --> 34:01.377
You'll be famous for

34:01.378 --> 34:02.511
how good of an actress you are.

34:02.512 --> 34:04.413
I hope so because that's all
that matters to me, Joanie.

34:04.414 --> 34:06.715
I would literally do this
for free if I had to.

34:06.716 --> 34:09.485
Okay. I didn't know that.

34:13.690 --> 34:16.692
I thought you were gonna call me
to celebrate my "Maxim" cover.

34:16.693 --> 34:18.793
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.429
Are you always this engaging?

34:29.406 --> 34:31.739
Excuse me.

34:31.741 --> 34:34.443
Lex? Mom?

34:34.444 --> 34:37.713
I'm not putting on a fat suit. No way.

34:37.714 --> 34:40.815
But I had to.. Oh, yeah.

34:40.817 --> 34:43.418
Come here close, come in tight.

34:46.822 --> 34:48.724
Hey, cut the music, cut the music.

34:48.725 --> 34:50.659
I know that's not Tangey Turner

34:50.659 --> 34:53.562
tryin' to leave
a Pablo Money party, is it?

34:53.563 --> 34:55.563
Whoo!

34:55.565 --> 34:57.800
You know I can't
let that happen, love.

34:57.801 --> 35:01.303
I mean, we need to sing a song
together or something, right?

35:01.304 --> 35:02.538
- Yeah.
- What y'all think?

35:05.375 --> 35:08.477
Tangey! Tangey! Tangey!

35:08.478 --> 35:11.447
Tangey! Tangey! Tangey!

35:11.448 --> 35:13.315
Tangey! Tangey!

35:18.755 --> 35:21.490
So, what do you wanna sing?

35:21.491 --> 35:23.792
Go with the flow.
I'll follow your lead.

35:23.793 --> 35:25.594
Alright.

35:25.595 --> 35:27.329
"Playing With Fire."

36:26.456 --> 36:27.755
Wanna get naked?

36:28.792 --> 36:30.359
Let's go.

36:57.713 --> 37:01.616
Sometimes the, uh,
stars just don't align.

37:01.617 --> 37:03.451
Some feels like..

37:03.452 --> 37:05.853
I don't know, it was always
meant to get away.

37:05.854 --> 37:07.788
What you shot..

37:07.789 --> 37:10.791
...every penny was on the screen.

37:10.792 --> 37:13.761
You produced the hell out
of the footage we have.

37:13.762 --> 37:14.896
You should be proud of that.

37:14.897 --> 37:17.598
I don't need a pep talk, Alan.

37:17.599 --> 37:19.634
Hey, this is me trying to be nice.

37:19.635 --> 37:21.701
And I don't need you to be nice to me.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.667
Ooh!

37:52.668 --> 37:55.001
Hey, you're amazing.

37:58.607 --> 38:00.608
Did you see the master bathroom

38:00.609 --> 38:02.610
in that house?

38:02.611 --> 38:05.846
Fancy bathrooms
are kind of a girl thing.

38:05.847 --> 38:08.482
The views were killer though.

38:08.483 --> 38:10.718
Production value was insane.

38:10.719 --> 38:13.788
I miss having a kitchen and a bathtub

38:13.789 --> 38:15.823
and a yard..

38:15.824 --> 38:17.725
We didn't have a yard in Beachwood.

38:20.829 --> 38:22.896
Should we move in together?

38:24.866 --> 38:26.933
Isn't that kinda
what we're doin' here?

38:28.837 --> 38:31.971
I mean, like, in that house..

38:34.509 --> 38:36.811
- If we can afford it.
- You mean if you can afford it?

38:36.812 --> 38:39.746
I'm not old-fashioned
about that kinda stuff, are you?

38:42.651 --> 38:44.851
If I had the dough,
I wouldn't mind if you didn't.

38:50.759 --> 38:52.859
So does that mean yes?

38:54.830 --> 38:58.532
Mm, even though
you hog most of the bed

38:58.533 --> 39:00.534
I'll have known that your face
is the last thing I'll see

39:00.535 --> 39:02.602
before I fall asleep.

39:04.873 --> 39:07.842
That's so romantic.

39:07.843 --> 39:10.578
I wanna be your safe place to land.

39:10.579 --> 39:11.878
So, if you want the house..

39:13.649 --> 39:15.715
...I'm there with you.

39:16.852 --> 39:18.818
Oh.. Ow!

39:28.730 --> 39:30.665
See ya.

39:30.666 --> 39:33.701
Thanks for pickin' me up.

39:33.702 --> 39:35.569
You sure about this?

39:35.570 --> 39:36.671
You're gonna get stressful really fast

39:36.672 --> 39:37.905
when you go back to the movie.

39:37.906 --> 39:39.707
I'm not going back to work.

39:39.708 --> 39:40.941
I'm just gettin' the hell out of here.

39:40.942 --> 39:42.942
Well, your place or mine?

39:54.756 --> 39:57.958
I don't, I don't
even know what that is.

39:57.959 --> 40:00.528
I don't know what that was.

40:00.529 --> 40:02.830
- Oh, my God.
- It was so good.

40:02.831 --> 40:03.964
Honestly, I thought for sure
you're going home

40:03.965 --> 40:05.499
with Pablo tonight.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.535
Um, yeah, that's what he thought too.

40:07.536 --> 40:09.570
I don't think he hears
the word "No" very often.

40:09.571 --> 40:11.806
Oh, you seemed into him.

40:11.807 --> 40:14.775
Mnm-mnm. I'm not ready
to start with anyone new.

40:14.776 --> 40:17.545
Why? Is this about Jordan?

40:17.546 --> 40:19.647
I don't know, he's everything
I ever wanted in a guy.

40:19.648 --> 40:21.714
So why did you break up with him?

40:22.951 --> 40:24.952
Okay.

40:24.953 --> 40:29.590
Alexis... this stays between us.

40:29.591 --> 40:32.593
I found out that he and Nina..

40:32.594 --> 40:33.993
...had an affair.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.535
Oh, my God!

40:41.536 --> 40:44.572
Every time I see him..

40:44.573 --> 40:46.739
...I just, I can't shake
the image of them together.

40:48.577 --> 40:50.978
Nina and Jordan together?
As in together-together?

40:50.979 --> 40:53.981
As in screwing. Yeah.

40:53.982 --> 40:55.716
Damn.

40:55.717 --> 40:57.618
I mean, good on her, but, oh, my God!

40:57.619 --> 40:59.587
It started out last season
in "Backsplash."

40:59.588 --> 41:01.555
Remember when Rainer went to rehab?

41:01.556 --> 41:02.623
Does he know?

41:02.624 --> 41:04.792
Do you think they'd still be
friends if he did?

41:04.793 --> 41:07.928
Girl, that's a kaboom-ass bombshell.
