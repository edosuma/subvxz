I HAD ENOUGH!

29:53.993 --> 29:55.294
SIT DOWN.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.263
JOSEPH, SIT DOWN.

30:02.168 --> 30:06.138
YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT
THESE DEMONS BEHIND YOU.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.841
I TOLD YOU BEFORE
YOU NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.509
YOU CANNOT DO THIS ALONE.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.514
I AM LOSING YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.383
NOW I WANNA DO SOMETHING.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.919
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.554
- TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO.
- YOU COULD TALK TO ME

30:22.588 --> 30:25.925
INSTEAD OF TALKING
DOWN TO ME.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.426
AND DON'T ATTACK ME.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.962
I'M NOT ATTACKING YOU.

30:29.996 --> 30:33.132
I'M TRYING TO BE
UNDERSTANDING.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.268
LOOK I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.937
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.642
I HANDLED THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.478
MY GENERATION.
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.382
I GUESS
I FIGURED THAT IF,

30:50.416 --> 30:53.920
IF YOU HAD THE PRESSURE
OF THE FAMILY DEPENDING ON YOU,

30:53.953 --> 30:55.922
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THAT WOULD BE THE ANSWER.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.157
WELL, IT'S NOT.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.959
ALL RIGHT,
I'M NOT YOU, GRAMP.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.293
I KNOW.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.295
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ME.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.997
LET'S SEE WHAT
THE DOCTOR SAYS,

31:05.031 --> 31:07.033

42:28.213 --> 42:31.349

45:04.035 --> 45:05.937
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

45:05.971 --> 45:07.172
I CAN SEE THAT.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.506
BUT I STILL NEED TO KNOW

45:08.539 --> 45:11.376
WHERE THOSE AREAS
OF EXPERTISE LIE

45:11.409 --> 45:13.912
SO I CAN FIT YOU
IN THE COMPANY.

45:13.945 --> 45:16.514
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
AND...

45:16.547 --> 45:18.884
I GAVE FIVE YEARS
OF SERVICE,

45:18.917 --> 45:20.418
MOST OF WHICH
WAS IN COMBAT.

45:20.451 --> 45:22.153
YEP. OKAY.

45:22.187 --> 45:23.855
I'M HIGHLY TRAINED
BY THE UNITED STATES MARINES,

45:23.889 --> 45:26.792
AND I THINK I'D BE
A PERFECT FIT FOR YOUR COMPANY.

45:26.825 --> 45:28.359
WELL, I THINK SO TOO,

45:28.393 --> 45:30.896
BUT WHAT I NEED
TO KNOW FROM YOU

45:30.929 --> 45:33.198
IS WHERE YOUR AREAS
OF EXPERTISE ARE.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.168
I WAS IN CHARGE OF MY UNIT,

45:37.202 --> 45:40.338
AND, UH...

45:40.371 --> 45:44.275
UH, I WAS IN CHARGE OF, UM...

45:44.309 --> 45:48.746
DID YOU GAIN SPECIAL
TRAINING IN ANY SPECIFIC AREA?

45:52.117 --> 45:53.985
I HATE THIS
FUCKING WEATHER.

45:54.019 --> 45:56.154
IT'S BETTER THAN THAT HOT
IRAQI DESERT WE WERE IN.

45:56.187 --> 45:59.024
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

45:59.057 --> 46:01.026
YOU WERE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
COMPLAINERS ABOUT THE HEAT.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.528
- BULLSHIT!
- THAT AIN'T NO BULLSHIT.

46:03.561 --> 46:04.996
MAN, LISTEN HERE.

46:05.030 --> 46:06.564
I HEAR HIS ASS MOANING
FROM HERE.

46:06.597 --> 46:10.268
AH, WHATEVER, AT LEAST
I'M NOT A SORE LOSER.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.303
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO TO WORK, BOYS.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.246
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

46:23.248 --> 46:28.486
DID YOU GAIN SPECIAL
TRAINING IN ANY SPECIFIC AREA?

46:28.519 --> 46:33.224
DID YOU SPECIALIZE IN A
SPECIFIC AREA IN THE MARINES?

46:35.493 --> 46:37.428
JOE, ARE YOU OKAY?

46:39.497 --> 46:41.332
MR. CARUSO?

46:41.366 --> 46:43.201
JOE!

46:43.234 --> 46:44.836
JOE!

46:44.870 --> 46:46.872
ARE YOU OKAY?

46:46.905 --> 46:48.539
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I GOTTA GO.

46:48.573 --> 46:50.241
NO, JOE,
DON'T DO THAT..

46:50.275 --> 46:52.410
JOE!

46:52.443 --> 46:54.579
JOE, COME BACK HERE.
JOE!

47:07.192 --> 47:08.326
WHO'S THERE?

47:10.061 --> 47:11.529
I REPEAT.
WHO'S THERE?

47:13.431 --> 47:15.233
FUCK!

47:25.110 --> 47:26.244
HELLO?

47:26.277 --> 47:29.547
UH, UH, RAY, I, I...

47:31.682 --> 47:34.185
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SAY THIS.

47:34.219 --> 47:36.121
YOUR GRANDSON
JUST LEFT AND...

47:36.154 --> 47:37.923
SOUNDS LIKE
IT DIDN'T GO THAT WELL.

47:37.956 --> 47:41.259
HE HAD A FLASHBACK,
AND THEN HE BOLTED.

47:41.292 --> 47:44.229
I'M JUST CALLING TO SEE IF
EVERYTHING'S OKAY ON YOUR END.

47:47.065 --> 47:48.366
HARRY,
HE'S NOT HOME YET.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.368
L-LISTEN.

47:50.401 --> 47:54.072
I'D HIRE THAT KID IN A SECOND
IF YOU WANTED ME TO,

47:54.105 --> 47:55.941
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

47:55.974 --> 47:58.944
I'D HATE MYSELF
IF HE GOT HURT HERE.

47:58.977 --> 48:02.280
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU,
AND NOW THAT I HAVE DONE THAT,

48:02.313 --> 48:05.683
WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO, I'LL DO.
IT'S YOUR CALL.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.452
YOU GUYS DID GREAT TODAY, MAN.
YOU GUYS WERE ALL RIGHT.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.254

48:09.287 --> 48:10.588

48:12.157 --> 48:13.959
ALL RIGHT.

DANA. DANA!

49:42.347 --> 49:44.215
YEAH, FRANK?

49:44.249 --> 49:45.583
CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF PHIL
FOR A SECOND?

49:45.616 --> 49:48.086
OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.289
JOEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, KID?

49:51.322 --> 49:52.623
HEY, FRANK.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.759
HOW ARE YA, BUDDY?

49:54.792 --> 49:57.028
I'M GOOD.

49:57.062 --> 50:01.032
BUT YOU'VE BEEN GOING AT IT WAY
TOO HEAVY AND WAY TOO LONG NOW.

50:01.066 --> 50:03.534
JOEY.

50:03.568 --> 50:06.037
YOU'RE NOT DRINKING,
YOU'RE BINGE-ING.

50:06.071 --> 50:08.039
RELAX, FRANK.

50:08.073 --> 50:09.540
I'M GONNA PAY FOR IT.

50:09.574 --> 50:11.609
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

50:11.642 --> 50:13.111
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.182
YOU'VE BEEN HITTING THE BOTTLE
WAY TOO HARD LATELY.

50:17.215 --> 50:18.683
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU,
MY FATHER?

50:18.716 --> 50:20.518
NO, I'M NOT,

50:20.551 --> 50:23.721
BUT THE ANSWER IS DEFINITELY
NOT IN THE BOTTLE.

50:23.754 --> 50:25.723
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

50:25.756 --> 50:28.593
NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

50:28.626 --> 50:31.696
JOEY'S JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED.
THAT'S ALL.

50:31.729 --> 50:34.565
COME ON, JOEY.
FRANK'S BEEN REAL GOOD TO YOU.

50:34.599 --> 50:36.434
I KNOW.

50:36.467 --> 50:38.069
WELL, YOU BOTH HAVE.

50:38.103 --> 50:39.770
BUT I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN.
I CAN DO WHAT I WANT.

50:39.804 --> 50:42.440
OH. A LITTLE RESPECT HERE, HUH?
FRANK DOESN'T HAVE TO DO SH--

50:42.473 --> 50:43.841
SAL, SAL, SAL.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

50:43.874 --> 50:46.277
JOEY'S GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF EMOTIONS.

50:46.311 --> 50:47.612
THAT DON'T MEAN
HE CAN COME IN HERE

50:47.645 --> 50:49.747
AND DISRESPECT YOU
LIKE THAT.

50:49.780 --> 50:52.450
YOU'RE RIGHT, SAL.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.086
BUT I'M GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH RIGHT NOW.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.455
I JUST NEED AN OUTLET.

50:57.488 --> 50:59.157
LISTEN, JOEY.

50:59.190 --> 51:01.826
I SEEN A LOT OF GUYS
GO DOWN THE SAME PATH,

51:01.859 --> 51:04.529
AND THEY'VE NEVER FOUND
THEIR WAY BACK.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.464
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO YOU.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.401
I APPRECIATE THAT.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.706
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
TO FATHER TEROMINA

51:15.740 --> 51:17.308
OVER AT SAINT PETER'S?

51:17.342 --> 51:19.777
NOT READY TO TALK
TO GOD JUST YET.

51:21.912 --> 51:25.082
- WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
- HOW ABOUT ASKING FOR HELP?

51:37.628 --> 51:40.131
THAT KID'S IN
NO MAN'S LAND.

51:40.165 --> 51:42.133
YEAH, BUT HE'S A GOOD KID.

51:42.167 --> 51:43.734
HE'LL FIND HIS WAY BACK.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.909
DR. BROWNE,

51:51.942 --> 51:54.912

52:15.233 --> 52:16.867
SO YOU'RE STRUGGLING
WITH THIS.

52:16.901 --> 52:19.337
NO, DOC. NO.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.172
NO WAY.

52:21.206 --> 52:23.508
EVERYBODY KEEPS TELLING ME
I CAN'T DO THIS,

52:23.541 --> 52:25.210

DOCTOR WILL BE WITH ME SHORTLY.

52:43.994 --> 52:45.963
I'VE BEEN BACK

52:45.996 --> 52:48.699
BASICALLY I HAD TO JUMP THROUGH
HOOPS TO GET THIS APPOINTMENT.

52:48.733 --> 52:50.401
THE WAR STARTED.
I WENT.

52:50.435 --> 52:51.736
I DIDN'T TELL THE WAR

54:26.764 --> 54:28.666
THEY CALL THIS

54:28.699 --> 54:31.469
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WAS LIVING
THEIR LIVE CONTINUOUSLY,

54:31.502 --> 54:33.471
WE NOW HAVE TO "ADJUST."

54:33.504 --> 54:35.973

54:36.006 --> 54:38.476
IT'S GOOD TO FEEL LIKE

56:49.674 --> 56:51.476
YOU DON'T DRINK VODKA?

56:54.111 --> 56:56.614
YOU'RE NOT A JACK MAN?

56:56.647 --> 56:59.950

57:02.520 --> 57:04.489

57:04.522 --> 57:06.557
WHAT TIME OF DAY IS IT NOW?

57:08.793 --> 57:10.094
WHAT THE FUCK
KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

57:10.127 --> 57:11.996
IT'S A SIMPLE ONE.

57:12.029 --> 57:13.931

LET'S CUT THE SHIT.

57:16.233 --> 57:17.935

- NO, I'M NOT FUCKIN' DRUNK.

57:17.968 --> 57:19.169
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING
MORE THAN USUAL?

57:19.203 --> 57:20.705
- NO!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

57:20.738 --> 57:22.707
COME HERE TO DROWN
YOUR SORROWS?

57:22.740 --> 57:24.241
MY SORROWS
DON'T DROWN ALL RIGHT?

57:24.274 --> 57:26.477
THEY JUST KEEP COMING BACK.

57:26.511 --> 57:28.946
IF I WANNA HAVE A DRINK EVERY NOW
AND THEN, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

57:28.979 --> 57:30.481
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
IT DOESN'T WORK.

57:30.515 --> 57:32.483
HAVE A SEAT PLEASE.

57:32.517 --> 57:35.486

57:35.520 --> 57:37.488
YOU GOT YOUR PAD RIGHT THERE.
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ME A SCRIPT?

57:37.522 --> 57:39.256
YOU CAN'T TAKE MEDS

57:39.289 --> 57:41.258
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M STUPID?

57:41.291 --> 57:43.628
YOU THINK I WANNA BECOME SOME
FUCKING JUNKIE PILL ADDICT?

57:43.661 --> 57:45.630
YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU
WANT TO DISCUSS WITH ME TODAY?

57:45.663 --> 57:46.964
BECAUSE I READ
YOUR RECORDS, OKAY?

57:46.997 --> 57:48.633
I KNOW YOU DID A TOUR
IN AFGHANISTAN.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.167
- LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.
- WELL, IF YOU READ MY RECORDS,

57:50.200 --> 57:51.736
THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT TO TELL ME, RIGHT?

57:51.769 --> 57:54.539
I'M NOT GETTING THE SENSE
YOU WANT MY HELP, SON.

57:54.572 --> 57:56.541
OH, I WANT THE HELP,
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

57:56.574 --> 57:57.875
HOW IN THE HELL
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME

57:57.908 --> 57:59.209
WHEN YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW ME.

57:59.243 --> 58:00.911
- NO, I DON'T KNOW YOU.
- NO, YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

58:00.945 --> 58:01.912
- I'M NOT YOU.
- OH, YOU'RE NOT ME.

58:01.946 --> 58:03.981
- WHO THE HELL AM I TO TELL...
- THAT'S RIGHT!

58:04.014 --> 58:06.083
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME ANYWAY, HUH?

58:06.116 --> 58:06.984
HUH?

58:07.017 --> 58:09.053
DOC?!

58:10.187 --> 58:11.789
LOOK AT YOU.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.558
YOU'RE A FUCKIN' JOKE.

58:15.793 --> 58:17.194
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

58:19.697 --> 58:21.666
WELL...

58:21.699 --> 58:24.669
I MAY NOT HAVE A CLUE,

58:24.702 --> 58:29.206
BUT I THINK IN
1968, RECON,

58:29.239 --> 58:32.743
I THINK I SAW
MORE THAN YOU THINK I SAW.

58:32.777 --> 58:35.245
AND I TURNED THE SHIT
I SAW INTO A PHD.

58:35.279 --> 58:39.249
YOU UNDERSTAND?
THREE BOOKS WERE SOLD.

58:39.283 --> 58:40.751
NOW YOU WANNA
GIVE ME SHIT,

58:40.785 --> 58:42.286
I'M GONNA SHOVE IT
RIGHT BACK UP YOUR ASS.

58:42.319 --> 58:44.021
YOU DON'T WANT WHAT I GOT?

58:44.054 --> 58:46.256
WELL, THERE'S A HUNDRED MEN
OUT HERE THAT DO.

58:46.290 --> 58:48.626
'CAUSE THEY READ CREDENTIALS.

58:48.659 --> 58:51.095
NOW YOU SEE THAT LITTLE GIRL HERE THAT
JUST WHEELED HERSELF OUT OF HERE?

58:51.128 --> 58:53.764
YOU KNOW WHY SHE'S HERE?

58:53.798 --> 58:56.100
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO GET BACK
TO WHO THE FUCK SHE WAS.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.068
YOU KNOW HOW SHE DOES THAT?
SHE TALKS.

58:58.102 --> 59:01.772
SHE TALKS TO ME
IN A CIVIL TONE.

59:01.806 --> 59:03.774
'CAUSE SHE'S SCARED.

59:03.808 --> 59:06.777
SHE'S SCARED JUST LIKE I WAS.
THE WAY YOU ARE.

59:06.811 --> 59:09.580
THE WAY ANY KID THAT COMES IN
THIS ROOM WITH SHIT IN HIS PANTS

59:09.614 --> 59:11.115
AND HE DON'T KNOW WHY.

59:11.148 --> 59:12.817
NOW YOU FIND
THAT INSUFFERABLE?

59:12.850 --> 59:14.151
DO YOU FIND
THAT UNACCEPTABLE?

59:14.184 --> 59:15.686
HEY, THEN DO YOURSELF
A FAVOR, MARINE,

59:15.720 --> 59:17.221
AND GET THE FUCK OUT
RIGHT NOW.

59:17.254 --> 59:19.223
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

59:19.256 --> 59:21.225
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A GRUNT
IN MY EYES RIGHT NOW, SON.

59:21.258 --> 59:23.227
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT
AS A FUCKING MOONBEAM.

59:23.260 --> 59:24.962
OKAY?

59:24.995 --> 59:27.264
THAT'S YOUR SCRIPT FROM THE DOC!
YOU GOT THAT, RAG MAN?

59:27.297 --> 59:29.800
THAT'S YOUR MED
FROM THE JOKE!

59:47.151 --> 59:49.654
IT NEVER STOPS.

59:49.687 --> 59:50.955
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

59:56.093 --> 59:57.728
THE DREAMS.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.766
VOICES.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.114
I THINK ABOUT THIS ONE DAY
IN AFGHANISTAN.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:23.220
WE'RE SCOUTING THE AREA,

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:26.423
I SPLIT UP THE UNIT.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:30.260
I SENT CRUZ ACROSS THE STREET TO
CHECK ON A GROUP OF CIVILIANS.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.801
AND THERE
WAS THIS EXPLOSION.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.402
AND THEY WERE ALL GONE.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.007
WE STARTED
TO TAKE FIRE

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.409
AND BENNY...

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.244
HE WENT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:52.216
I WENT TO CHECK ON BENNY.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:55.019
HE WAS GONE.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:56.821
THEY KILLED HIM.

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:01.158
THAT'S WHEN
I STARTED SHAKING.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:08.132
I DOVE BEHIND
THE CORNER OF A BUILDING,

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.100
AND THAT'S WHEN I HEARD
THE VOICES.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.739
THERE WAS PEOPLE
COMING, AND I--

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:16.741
I COULDN'T
TAKE THE CHANCE.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:25.983
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER,

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.285
I CAME AROUND
THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING...

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:35.125
AND THAT'S WHEN
I SAW THE BODIES.

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.462
I KEEP SEEING
THE BODIES.

01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:44.769
THAT'S WHAT I SEE.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:47.337
HOW OFTEN?

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.339
EVERY DAY.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:56.380
I DREAM ABOUT IT
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:02.019
I LOOK DOWN,

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:05.856
I SEE THIS KID

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.858
WITH HALF A HEAD.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.329
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.199
TO HURT YOURSELF?

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.801
HMM?

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:42.026
HELLO, MR. CARUSO.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.794
HOW'S JOE?

01:02:43.828 --> 01:02:45.462
SAME.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:49.366
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, SARAH?
- I'M OKAY.

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:52.536
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
WITH YOU TWO?

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:54.471
DID HE DO SOMETHING
WRONG TO YOU?

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.006
NO.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.275
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, MR. C.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.543
I'M SO SCARED.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:01.078
I KNOW YOU ARE,
SWEETHEART.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.080
WE ALL ARE.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.548
HAS HE CALLED YOU AT ALL?

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:06.083
NO.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.485
WE REALLY LEFT OFF
ON BAD TERMS.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:11.121
BE PATIENT.
HE'LL COME AROUND.

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:13.123
I HOPE SO.

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:14.925
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.527
LISTEN, I'M SURE
THINGS ARE GONNA WORK OUT.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.396
HE'LL WAKE UP.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.932
HE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
SOME TOUGH TIMES NOW,

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:24.001
BUT I KNOW
THAT HE LOVES YOU.

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:32.242
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME
AND GET A LITTLE REST?

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:35.245
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.
I PROMISE.

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:37.581
NOW LET ME SEE A BIG SMILE
ON THAT PRETTY FACE.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:42.152
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU, TOO.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:53.197
- HOW'S NEXT TUESDAY?
- UM...

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.132
- HOW'S ONE O'CLOCK?
- PERFECT!

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.467
- OH, MAX.
- JOEY, HOW YOU DOIN'?

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.169
AH. NOT BAD, MAN.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:01.005
GREAT. THINGS ARE REALLY
GETTIN' BETTER FOR ME.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.140
DOC IS REALLY
HELPING ME OUT A LOT.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.642
REALLY, I MEAN, I CAN SEE
THINGS MORE CLEARLY NOW.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.945
- AH, THAT'S GOOD, MAN.
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:09.279
WHAT'RE YOU DOIN' TONIGHT?
YOU WANNA GRAB A BEER?

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:12.182
OF COURSE.
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE BAR?

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.984
HOW ABOUT I JUST COME
PICK YOU UP LIKE,

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:14.985
I DON'T KNOW,
TEN O'CLOCK?

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:16.520
- EVEN BETTER.
- THAT'S COOL?

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:17.621
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:18.923
- GOOD LUCK.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.324
BYE.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.498
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.067
YEAH,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:33.270
SAL!

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.573
WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.042
I GOT TO LEAVE EARLY AGAIN.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.609
ELLEN'S HAVING A BAD NIGHT.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.245
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.485
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING, BOYS?

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:50.387
CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.521
OR IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:53.057
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.391
I APPRECIATE IT, THOUGH.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:56.260
NOW YOU CALL ME
IF ANYTHING, OKAY?

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.695
WILL DO.
WE'RE GOOD.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.364
DON'T WORRY.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.436
- LAURA.
- WHAT'S UP, LAURA?

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:09.239
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- LOOKIN' GOOD.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.542
COULD I GET TWO BEERS,
PLEASE?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.249
LOOK, I KNOW I ASKED YOU ALREADY
AND YOU WEREN'T READY TO TELL ME,

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:22.419
BUT I GOTTA ASK YOU
AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.222
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
WHY THE SHRINK?

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:28.558
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M GAY.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.061
AND THE MILITARY
DOESN'T ACCEPT IT.

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:34.031
NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:36.033
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S WHY
YOU WERE SEEING A SHRINK.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.368
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON, BUT...

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.404
LOOK, MAX,

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.272
WITH WHAT WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH,

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:44.574
ALL RIGHT, THAT SHIT
DON'T MATTER TO ME.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.576
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.
ALL RIGHT?

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.746
YOU DON'T OWE ME
ANY EXPLANATIONS.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.083
I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT MOST
SOLDIERS DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

01:05:53.117 --> 01:05:54.584
WELL, SCREW THEM!
ALL RIGHT?

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:57.454
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
HONORED TO SERVE WITH YOU.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.424
I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
HARD IT COULD BE ON SOMEBODY.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.994
THANKS.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.729
YOU KNOW WHEN THE DON'T ASK
DON'T TELL POLICY ENDED,

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:09.166
THAT'S WHEN I CAME OUT,
AND THE ABUSE I TOOK.

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:12.469
I MEAN, THE BEATINGS
AND THE RIDICULE.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:18.142
I MEAN,
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:22.479
SO I JUST KEPT REHASHING THAT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN MY MIND.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.248
AND I JUST
WANTED IT TO END,

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:28.018
SO THAT'S WHEN
I DECIDED TO GET SOME HELP.

01:06:28.052 --> 01:06:30.220
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

01:06:30.254 --> 01:06:32.222
AH.

01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:33.723
I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.425
JUST THAT I'M HAVING TROUBLE

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:39.129
DEALING WITH ALL THE SHIT
THAT WENT ON OVER THERE.

01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:41.598
I JUST FEEL ISOLATED.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:45.502
YOU KNOW, CUT OFF FROM
WHO I WAS BEFORE.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.371
I FUCKED UP
AND PEOPLE DIED.

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:49.639
I'M JUST BARELY
KEEPING MY SHIT TOGETHER.

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:56.313
HEY, GUYS,
ON THE HOUSE.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.382
THANKS, SAL.
APPRECIATE IT, MAN.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:02.486
EXCUSE ME?

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.790
GO GET A ROOM.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.793
HEY, I THINK
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:13.463
IT AIN'T WORTH IT, JOE.
HE AIN'T WORTH IT, MAN.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:16.466
WHOA. WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
YOU FUCKING GIMP.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.768
WHAT THE FUCK?

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.209

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:27.544
- YOU'RE AN ASS!

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.413
YOU COMING, GRACE?

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:30.780
I CAN'T.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.686
TAKE IT EASY,
DUDE! AGH!

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.388
- WHAT THE FUCK YOU GONNA DO!
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:41.725
- OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH!
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:44.594
GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE RIGHT
NOW BEFORE THE COPS SHOW UP.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.530
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.166
HE AIN'T TALKIN NOW IS HE,

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.168
AND IF I EVER SEE YOU
IN MY FUCKING BAR AGAIN

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:53.170
I'M GONNA SHOVE THIS BAT
SO FAR UP YOUR ASS

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:56.606
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
YOU'RE A POPSICLE.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.842
OH, WHAT'S UP, BRI?
LONG TIME NO SEE.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.610
YEAH.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.479
WHAT CRAWLED UP YOUR ASS?

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:06.450
JOE, I'M SURE WHAT HAPPENED
OVER THERE WASN'T PLEASANT.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.187
YOU'RE NOT
THE SAME GUY NO MORE.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.556
TOO MUCH FUCKIN' BOOZE
AND ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:16.359
LOOK AT YOU.
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY.

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:19.595
NO. NOT ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY,
NOT AT ALL.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.298
BUT I'M NOT TRYIN'
TO BRING EVERYONE DOWN

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.500
AND GET EVERYONE DRUNK
'CAUSE I'M HURTIN'.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:30.506
WE ALL LOOKED UP TO YOU.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.309
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.179
I WENT TO WAR,
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.247
I COME HOME AND EVERYBODY'S
JUST LAUGHING IT UP!

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:39.749
OH, SO NOW EVERYBODY AROUND YOU
HAS TO PAY THE PRICE?

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:41.451
WHAT, WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE FUN NO MORE?

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:42.786
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.921
OH, OH, GUYS! GUYS!

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.724
JOE, BRIAN'S RIGHT, MAN.
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:50.493
YOU CHANGED.
WE ALL LOOKED UP TO YOU.

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:51.828
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:54.663
SCREW YOU TOO, IAN,
ALL RIGHT?

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:56.200
I'M SICK OF YOU
FUCKIN' CRYBABIES.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:58.202
COME ON, JOE,
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.569
JUST COME ON.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.841
COME ON.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.488
- FUCK!

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:21.658
IT'S THE COPS.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.194
DAMN IT.

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:25.929
WERE YOU SPEEDING?

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.564
I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW!

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:46.850
WANNA GIVE ME A LIFT
TO THE MOVIES?

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.391
YOU'VE BEEN HOME FOR OVER A YEAR,
AND THERE'S STILL NO STRUCTURE.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:59.463
NO JOB, NO CHANGES.

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.499
ALL YOU DO IS HANG AROUND
THE HOUSE AND DRINK.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.601
PASSES THE TIME.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:07.937
I DON'T GOTTA
LISTEN TO THIS.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.307
WHERE YOU GOIN'?

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.008
IS IT THAT EASY FOR YOU
TO QUIT NOW?

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.744
MAYBE IF YOU ACTED LIKE A MAN
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY SHIT.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:16.546
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:20.450
WHY DON'T YOU SHAVE
THAT MESS OFF YOUR FACE?

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:22.752
- I KINDA LIKE IT.
- YEAH, YOU LIKE IT

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:25.289
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU
SOMETHING ELSE TO HIDE BEHIND.

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:26.856
I JUST TOLD YOU I'M TRYIN'.
ALL RIGHT?

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.858
AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.560
I GET THAT!

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:33.563
BUT YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO!

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:37.434
AND YOU HAVE TO GET MOVING!

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:38.968
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.770
FORGET IT.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.449
RAY. JOEY.

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:53.950
- HEY, UNCLE NICK.
- HEY.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.488
OH, WHERE YOU GOIN'?

01:10:58.522 --> 01:11:00.457
I'M TRYIN'
TO GO TO THE MOVIES,

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.692
BUT I'M GETTIN' A LECTURE
INSTEAD OF A RIDE.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.494
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:05.829
OH, BIG SHOT.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:08.832
LOST HIS LICENSE FROM A DUI.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:11.368
- SEE?
- COME ON, RAY.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:13.036
JOE, I'LL TAKE YA.

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:16.640
IF MY BROTHER HERE DOESN'T
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:18.742
NICK, IT'S BEEN
A LONG MINUTE.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.445
WELL, I JUST STOPPED BY
TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOIN'.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:24.448
OH, THEY'RE GOIN'. HE'S JUST
BEING A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.783
WELL, AREN'T WE ALL
AT TIMES?

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.018
BESIDES YOU KNOW THE KID'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:32.021
HE'S GOT A HEART OF GOLD
JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:34.758
YEAH, BUT HIS MOTHER
WAS AS REASONABLE AS CAN BE,

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.093
AND HE'S A HARD-HEADED KID.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.628
DON'T I KNOW IT.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:41.431
HEY, I'M RIGHT HERE!

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:43.533
YEAH, YOU ARE.

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:47.404
- OKAY IF I TAKE HIM?
- SURE.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.473
IT SAVES ME FROM
HAVING TO DO IT.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.809
COME ON, JOEY,
LET'S GO.

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:11.961
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
AND YOUR GRANDFATHER?

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.731
I'M DEALIN' WITH
ALL KINDS OF SHIT.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:17.000
AND HE JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND ME.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.868
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.872
WHEN YOUR MOM AND DAD DIED,

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:24.508
NORA AND I
WANTED TO RAISE YOU,

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:26.376
BUT RAY WOULDN'T HAVE IT.
HE STEPPED UP.

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:29.713
HE SAID,
NO, HE'S GONNA RAISE YOU.

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.047
HE DEVOTED HIS WHOLE
LIFE TO GIVE YOU

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.816
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU NEEDED.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:36.119
SO DON'T THINK FOR ONE MINUTE
THAT HE DOESN'T CARE.

01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:37.654
I DON'T KNOW.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.556
I MEAN, MAYBE.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:41.458
NO, NOT MAYBE.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.661
HE CARES!

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.730
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'RE GOIN'
THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF RIGHT NOW,

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.398
BUT, MAN,
YOU'RE HITTING IT HARD,

01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:50.033
AND YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S RIGHT.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.035
IF YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER
WERE ALIVE RIGHT NOW

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:54.504
AND THEY SAW
THE WAY YOU ARE

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:56.005
IT WOULD BREAK
THEIR HEARTS.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:57.707
WELL, THEY'RE NOT!

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:05.148
LISTEN, I'M SORRY,
UNCLE NICK, ALL RIGHT?

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:06.850
I KNOW.

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:14.123
JOEY, LISTEN.

01:13:14.157 --> 01:13:17.126
WE'RE FAMILY.
LEAN ON US.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.562
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.897
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS, UNCLE NICK.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.166
IT'S JUST SOMETHIN'
I GOTTA DO ON MY OWN.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.650
ARE YOU DRUNK AGAIN?

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:42.452
YEAH, YOU'RE DRUNK.

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:44.454
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
WAITIN' UP FOR ME?

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:46.055
YES, I'M WAITING UP
FOR YOU.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.957
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA COME HOME

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.826
OR IF THEY'RE GONNA
FIND YOU DEAD SOMEWHERE.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:53.563
- I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS AGAIN.
- YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS?

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:57.634
I DID NOT RAISE YOU
TO BE A LOSER.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.636
YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE--

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:01.471
THIS IS HOW
YOU PAY ME BACK?

01:14:01.505 --> 01:14:04.107
THIS IS HOW YOU SMEAR THE
MEMORY OF YOUR PARENTS.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.643
YOU'RE PUSHING ME
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:08.144
OH, REALLY?

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.247
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO WAKE THE FUCK UP!

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.249
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAMPS?
I HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, ALL RIGHT?

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.519
YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER,
YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER,

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:17.821
SO THANKS FOR THE LIFE YOU GAVE
ME, BUT STAY THE FUCK OUT OF IT!

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:19.489
WELL, THEN YOU GET
THE FUCK OUT!

01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:21.758
IF YOU CAN'T MAN UP!

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.761
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.196
I JOINED THE MARINES
TO BE LIKE YOU.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.502
I'M SO SORRY!

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.072
I'M SORRY TOO, JOEY.

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:38.975
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE PROUD OF ME.

01:14:39.008 --> 01:14:40.777
I AM.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.145
I'M PROUD.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.080
BUT I'M SCARED.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:46.049
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO GET THROUGH TO YOU.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:48.652
I JUST NEED SOME TIME.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.854
PLEASE JUST GIVE ME
SOME TIME.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:31.060
- HEY, SWEET SUE.
- HEY, MAX.

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:32.629
- HI.
- YO!

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.297
- WHAT'S UP?
- AH, NOTHING, MAN.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.601
- HOW'VE YOU BEEN?
- STILL BREATHING.

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:39.703
- HOW'S WORK?
- IT'S TOUGH.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.104
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SERVICE,

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.972
YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE
ALWAYS HAS YOUR BACK.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:44.608
WELL, THAT'S HOW
WE SURVIVE.

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:46.109
YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU GET BACK,
THAT'S DONE.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.077
EVERYONE'S OUT FOR
THEMSELVES.

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:50.179
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.716
HOW YOU MAKING OUT?
HE'S HELPING YOU?

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:55.018
AH. YOU KNOW,
THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.153
WHEN THINGS ARE BROKE,

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.822
THEY CAN'T BE FIXED.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.824
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.191
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE THINKIN' OF QUITTIN'!

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:04.594
THAT'S IT?

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:05.962
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.296
OH, COME ON, JOE.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.032
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.900
NOTHIN'S EVER THAT BAD.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.337
GUYS!

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:18.107
OH, MY GOD, LAURA.
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:21.711
THE DOC SAYS HE DOESN'T NEED
TO SEE ME FOR ANOTHER MONTH.

01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:23.813
OH, I'M GONNA MISS
THAT SMILE.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:25.815
YEAH, RIGHT?

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:28.217
SEE? SOMETIMES YOU WORK
HARD ENOUGH AT SOMETHIN'

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.253
AND SOMETIMES YOU WIN.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:36.025
YOU SEE? SOME THINGS
THAT ARE BROKE CAN BE FIXED.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:39.896
YEAH, BUT I HEARD THE WOUNDS
YOU CAN'T SEE ARE THE WORST.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.698
AND I BELIEVE IT.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.869
- HOW YOU FEELIN'?
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:50.940
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD'VE
STARTED MUCH SOONER.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:54.310
YEAH, ME TOO.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:55.779
I WISH YOU HAD.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.988
CAN'T SAY I'M LIKING
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:07.824
GOTTA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS WARDROBE.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.894
YOU LOOK LIKE
A SWAMP HOG.

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:12.428
WHAT ARE YOU,
A THERAPIST OR A STYLIST?

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.998
YOU COULD TIGHTEN IT UP.

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:16.733
WOULDN'T HURT.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.401
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT I LOOK LIKE?

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.770
- IT'S ALL ONE-SIDED ANYWAY.
- HOW SO?

01:17:22.706 --> 01:17:25.308
YOU DO EVERYTHING
YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU TO DO

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.977
AND THEY JUST LEAVE YOU...

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.278
HANGIN'.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.885
YOU CAN'T KEEP
ASSIGNING BLAME.

01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:37.220
YOU KNOW?

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.024
WE DON'T DEAL IN
HALF TRUTHS.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.928
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT.

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:45.929
YEAH.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.801
HOW'S YOUR GRANDPA?

01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:53.803
UH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

01:17:53.837 --> 01:17:56.172
YOU KNOW, OUR RELATIONSHIP'S
STRAINED, THOUGH.

01:17:56.205 --> 01:17:57.941
STRAINED, HUH?

01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:00.076
YOU ADDING TO THAT?

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.382
THIS FUNNY THING LOVE.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:12.722
IT'S ALL A PART OF IT,
ISN'T IT?

01:18:12.756 --> 01:18:16.125
THE SUPPORT PROCESS.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.894
OR WHATEVER
THE HELL IT IS.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.198
COME ON,
HAVE A SEAT.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:30.974
WHAT'S UP, GRAMP?

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.208
NEED A HAND?

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:33.977
NAH, I GOT IT.

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.444
BUT I CAN USE THE COMPANY.

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:37.013
AH, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.382
I GOT NOTHING GOING ON
ANYWAY.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:41.184
HOW WAS THE SESSION?

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.519
AH, IT WAS ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.254
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:47.023
I DON'T KNOW.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:48.858
I WISH I DID.

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:50.526
WELL, YOU JUST
HANG IN THERE.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.897
BY NOW YOU KNOW THAT SOME
SESSIONS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS,

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:56.465
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU'RE
GETTING THE HELP THAT YOU NEED.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:59.769
I JUST-- I HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

01:18:59.803 --> 01:19:01.137
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:02.872
I TOLD YA.

01:19:02.906 --> 01:19:05.341
I HAD A TOUGH TIME
WHEN I GOT BACK FROM VIETNAM.

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:07.376
YEAH, BUT THAT'S THE THING.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.945
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT IT.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:12.048
NO, I KNOW, BUT NOW WE HAVE
MORE IN COMMON.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.317
OH, MAX.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:16.052
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, JOE?
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.453
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MR. C.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.122
- IT'S RAY.
- RAY.

01:19:19.155 --> 01:19:20.523
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, MAX.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:22.291
THANK YOU.
I FEEL GOOD.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.427
ME AND SOME FRIENDS ARE
GOING OUT TONIGHT. YOU IN?

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.530
AH, I DON'T KNOW, I THINK I'M
GONNA JUST CHILL IN TONIGHT.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:28.965
I'M NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.934
JOE, IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
YOU SURE?

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.401
NAH, I'M GOOD, MAN. I'LL
CATCH YOU NEXT TIME, THOUGH.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.037
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.238
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.572
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
I APPRECIATE THE INVITE.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.942
BYE, MR. C-- UH, RAY.

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:40.043
GREAT DUDE, MAN.

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:41.845
JOE, YOU CAN GO WITH THEM.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.312
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:45.548
NAH, I THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE THAT TALK NOW.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:47.917
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:50.086
SURE.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:04.968
SO, GRAMP, HOW COME YOU NEVER
TALK ABOUT YOUR TIME AT WAR?

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:08.004
ALL YOU EVER SAY IS YOU
SERVED YOUR COUNTRY, PERIOD.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.511
COMBAT IS A HARD THING
TO GET YOUR HANDS AROUND.

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:19.849
MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND,
EVEN THOUGH THEY THINK THEY DO,

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:22.986
AND I KNOW
THEY WANT TO,

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:25.588
BUT UNLESS THEY'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN THERE THEMSELVES,

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.256
THEY JUST DON'T.

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:32.428
LIKE I SAID, YOU AND ME
HAVE MORE IN COMMON NOW.

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.330
WE BOTH SERVED.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.465
BUT MORE THAN THAT.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:39.568
I HAD PTSD
BEFORE THEY CALLED IT THAT.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:42.906
- YEAH?
- OH, YEAH.

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.073
FLASHBACKS.

01:20:44.107 --> 01:20:47.076
NIGHTMARES, PANIC ATTACKS.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:50.346
HOW BAD WAS IT?

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:54.984
YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND I SLEPT
IN SEPARATE BEDS FOR TWO YEARS.

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:57.286
WHY?

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.889
I CHOKED HER IN HER SLEEP
ONE NIGHT.

01:20:59.923 --> 01:21:02.091
I HAD MY HANDS
AROUND HER THROAT

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:04.227
AND SHE WAS TURNING BLUE
WHEN I WOKE UP

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.162
AND REALIZED
WHAT I WAS DOING.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.332
HOLY SHIT.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:13.036
I HAD NO IDEA.

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:15.404
DID MOM AND DAD KNOW?

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:18.174
THEY KNEW I WAS A MARINE.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ELSE.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.443
YEAH, WELL, HARRY SAID
HE KNEW YOU FROM THE V.A.,

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:22.411
BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T
GET INTO IT.

01:21:22.445 --> 01:21:24.247
YEAH, BUT THAT'S COMMON.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.116
MOST GUYS DON'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:30.586
AND WHEN THEY DO, IT'S USUALLY
ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:34.123
YEAH, BUT HOW'D YOU
GET THROUGH IT?

01:21:34.157 --> 01:21:36.960
I FOUND THAT, FOR ME,
THE BEST THING WAS

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:39.562
I KEPT IN TOUCH
WITH MY MARINE BUDDIES.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:41.464
THEY UNDERSTOOD ME.

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:43.466
THEY REALLY HELPED ME
GET THROUGH IT.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.235
YEAH.
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

01:21:46.269 --> 01:21:49.038
YOU KNOW,
MAX HELPS ME OUT A LOT.

01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.406
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:52.041
YOU KNOW,
I STILL KEEP IN TOUCH

01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:56.112
WITH SOME OF THOSE GUYS
EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.713
IT'S A LIFELONG BOND.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.382
ROGER THAT.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.384
SO'S A FAMILY'S LOVE.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:05.054
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:07.556
NOT AS DIFFERENT
AS YOU THINK.

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:12.461
I WILL ALWAYS
HAVE YOUR BACK.

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:14.563
I KNOW, POP.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:16.599
I KNOW.

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.569
WANT TO COME BY
AND WATCH THE GAME LATER?

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:24.640
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
WHAT TIME?

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:29.012
I THINK THE START TIME'S 8:00,
SO COME BY 7:30.

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:30.479
WE GONNA EAT?

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:32.481
YEAH.
I'LL ORDER, UH--

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:35.151
I'LL ORDER PIZZA OR CHINESE,
WHATEVER YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR.

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:37.253
WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.088
I MIGHT WANT SANDWICHES.

01:22:39.122 --> 01:22:40.456
UH.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:42.491
YOU KNOW, YOU SUCK.

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:44.460
NOW THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:46.195
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:48.464
- I MEANT BASKETBALL.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:50.133
YO, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SERIOUS.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:51.267
HEY.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.735
MAXI PAD.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:55.038
WHO'S YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.475
RELAX.
THE KID'S NAME IS JASON.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.378
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT
TO ME SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:04.413
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LET THAT
SHIT ROLL OFF YOUR BACK, MAN.

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:06.282
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.518
NO, YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:24.133
JOE?

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:30.273
WHAT THE FUCK, JOE?

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:32.375
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME NOW?

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:03.232
I REALLY MISS THEM.

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:05.801
I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOT HERE
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:08.271
YOUR PARENTS MUST HAVE BEEN
WONDERFUL PEOPLE.

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:09.872
YEAH, THEY WERE.

01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:11.707
ESPECIALLY MY MOM.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:15.878
YOU KNOW, I LOVE MY FATHER,
BUT MY MOM....

01:25:15.911 --> 01:25:18.281
YEAH, SHE GOT ME.

01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:21.584
SHE WAS SO COMPASSIONATE.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.187
SHE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO TO STEER
ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.723
SHE'D KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:28.891
SHE ALWAYS DID.

01:25:28.924 --> 01:25:30.593
LIKE I SAID.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.261
YOU'RE DIFFERENT WHEN
YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR MOM.

01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:34.330
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH YOUR DAD?

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:36.199
MY DAD?

01:25:36.232 --> 01:25:38.667
HE WAS JUST LIKE
MY GRANDFATHER, YOU KNOW.

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:40.703
NOTHING'S EVER
QUITE GOOD ENOUGH.

01:25:42.205 --> 01:25:43.839
AND HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.541
HE WENT THROUGH IT HIMSELF.

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:47.243
YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM
A BREAK

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:50.779
BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD MAN,
AND HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:52.315
WHAT'D YOU COME HERE FOR?

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:54.817
TO PISS ME OFF?

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.220
LET'S JUST SAY I KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE,

01:25:57.253 --> 01:25:59.222
AND I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ANGER

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:03.259
THAT YOU FEEL
FUELED BY LOVE OR HATE.

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:04.827
OH, YOU DO?

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.296
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO BECOME A THERAPIST NOW?

01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:08.897
MAYBE. WHY NOT?
THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:11.700
I COULD SPECIALIZE
IN GAYS COMING OUT.

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.402
YEAH, RIGHT.

01:26:13.436 --> 01:26:15.371
YOU KNOW, I ALMOST WENT TO JAIL
BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR CAUSE.

01:26:15.404 --> 01:26:17.973
OH, NOW, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO GET VIOLENT.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.842
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUSHED ME
ASIDE AND THEN RAN OVER THERE.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.009
I WASN'T GONNA
HIT HIM, THOUGH.

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:24.380
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO,
GO GET A GAME OF PARCHEESI?

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:25.581
- HOW ABOUT DISCUSS IT?
- COME ON.

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:26.715
YOU EVER HEARD
OF DISCUSSING IT?

01:26:26.749 --> 01:26:28.317
- DISCUSS IT?
- YEAH.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:30.986
WITH THOSE ASSHOLES?
NO FUCKING WAY.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.788
ALL RIGHT? THEY DESERVED
EVERYTHING THEY GOT.

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:36.292
BESIDES, THEY HAD NO IDEA
WHAT LAURA WENT THROUGH

01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:39.262
OR THAT WE WENT TO WAR
FOR HIS FUCKING RIGHTS.

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:40.729
SO YOU HIT HIM
WITH A BOTTLE.

01:26:42.331 --> 01:26:43.499
JOE, JOE, JOE.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:46.502
YOU HAVE TO--
YOU HAVE TO CHILL.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:48.871
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA
PUT YOUR MIND IN A GOOD PLACE.

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.673
YOU GOTTA RELAX.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.675
YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT THE WORLD
ALL THE TIME.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.478
- DOCTOR MAX.
- YOU LIKE THAT.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:58.247
I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAN.
I KNOW.

01:26:58.281 --> 01:26:59.815
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS SO CALM.

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:01.417
I REALLY DON'T.

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:02.951
IT'S EASY.

01:27:02.985 --> 01:27:05.388
YOU JUST HANG OUT WITH SOMEBODY
MORE FUCKED UP THAN YOU.

01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:09.258
YEAH, RIGHT.

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:11.527
OH, MAN.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.429
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING, MAN.

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:14.463
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

01:27:14.497 --> 01:27:16.465
- YOU READY?
- YEAH.

01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:21.970
EXPOSURE THERAPY
IS ABOUT GETTING DOWN

01:27:22.004 --> 01:27:23.539
TO YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY,
YOU KNOW?

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.842
THERE'S NO OUT.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:30.346
WHY DO YOU KEEP AVERTING
TO THESE OPINIONS, HUH,

01:27:30.379 --> 01:27:32.014
ABOUT YOUR OWN SELF WORTH?

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:33.516
I TOLD YOU ALREADY.

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:36.419
OKAY, INDULGE ME.

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:39.655
I COULDN'T TALK TO SARAH
WITHOUT HER MENTIONING MARRIAGE.

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:41.824
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T HOLD
A CONVERSATION WITHOUT HER

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:44.293
SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE KIDS.

01:27:44.327 --> 01:27:47.863
MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
TO GO TO WAR.

01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:49.932
I CAME BACK,
I WASN'T THE SAME GUY.

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:54.503
I HAD TO PUSH HER AWAY
A LITTLE.

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:58.541
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED
OR YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:27:59.875
OR MAYBE YOU JUST
WANT TO THROW ALL THAT--

01:27:59.908 --> 01:28:01.310
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:03.679
WELL, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.280
I OPENED THE DOOR.

01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:10.986
JOSEPH, DO YOU CARE
ABOUT THIS GIRL?

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:13.055
I MEAN, YOU LOVE HER?

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:14.790
YOU MISS HER?

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:18.060
DOES SHE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE?

01:28:18.093 --> 01:28:20.028
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:23.098
CAUSE SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.634
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE DESERVES TO?

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:27.403
I DON'T KNOW.

01:28:30.706 --> 01:28:33.108
DO YOU TALK?

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.344
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER
IF WE DIDN'T TALK.

01:28:38.581 --> 01:28:40.082
CAN YOU CALL HER?

01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:45.854
I MEAN, WHAT'S TO LOSE?

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.825
MAN, YOU DON'T STOP,
DO YOU?

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:02.104
OH, I'M STARVING, MAN.

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:05.741
- FOOD'S HERE.
- IS IT?

01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:09.077
- WOW, THAT WAS FAST.
- HI, GUYS. HERE YOU GO.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:10.846
- THANK YOU. -HOW COME
YOU GOT THE SAME THING?

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:12.548
I GOT THE CHICKEN, THOUGH.

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:14.082
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU GUYS NEED OR ARE YOU OKAY?

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:15.751
- OH, NO, THANK YOU.
- OKAY, COOL. ENJOY.

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:17.152
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.422
YO, SO THE DOC THINKS
I SHOULD CALL SARAH,

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:20.823
OPEN UP TO HER,

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.658
AND PART OF ME
WANTS TO,

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.827
AND THE OTHER PART OF ME'S
TELLING ME,

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.128
"EH, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA."

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:28.864
MAYBE THE DOC'S RIGHT.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:31.434
WHAT IF SHE SLAMS
THE DOOR IN MY FACE?

01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:32.935
YOU TURN AROUND
AND YOU LEAVE.

01:29:32.968 --> 01:29:36.004
YEAH, LIKE IT'S THAT EASY.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:39.074
ME AND YOU,
WE'RE SURVIVORS.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.444
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:43.512
SO I GUESS
THIS SHOULD BE NO SWEAT.

01:29:45.448 --> 01:29:48.451
IT'S GREAT KNOWING SOMEONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS ME.

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:50.185
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO NEED
FOR A TRANSLATOR.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.020
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:53.722
YOU GOT MY BACK,

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:55.624
I GOT YOURS.

01:30:10.773 --> 01:30:12.007
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.809
- MR. CARUSO?
- YEAH.

01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:16.078
I'M MIKE.
I'M JOE'S DOCTOR.

01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:18.113
OH, PLEASE COME IN.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:21.484
YEAH, SORRY TO SHOW UP
UNANNOUNCED LIKE THIS.

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:24.186
- DOC. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- HEY.

01:30:24.219 --> 01:30:25.187
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.223
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.792
IT'S YOUR BUDDY, MAX.

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:31.093
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:35.698
HE TOOK HIS LIFE.

01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:36.899
DURING THE NIGHT.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:38.967
WHAT?

01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:40.736
NO.

01:30:42.004 --> 01:30:43.906
NO.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.708
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.849
NO, NOT MAX.

01:30:53.882 --> 01:30:55.884
I WAS JUST
WITH HIM YESTERDAY.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:02.090
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.162
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:10.999
BUT MAX WAS SO STRONG.

01:31:11.033 --> 01:31:15.003
NO FUCKIN' WAY.

01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:16.872
I WISH HE WOULD HAVE
COME TO ME.

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:22.778
I'M HERE FOR YOU, JOE.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.782
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.786
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:35.257
AND WHERE DID THAT
GET MAX?

01:31:36.959 --> 01:31:40.195
- YOU GOTTA OPEN UP, MAN.
- NO.

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:42.898
HEY, YOU WON'T OPEN UP?

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:44.600
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:31:46.802 --> 01:31:50.272
WE FAILED HIM.
WE DID.

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:52.074
BUT YOU DON'T FAIL YOURSELF.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:56.879
YOU DON'T FAIL YOURSELF.

01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:07.222
I'VE GOT YOU DOWN FOR
TOMORROW AT 10:00, ALL RIGHT?

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.091
- I'M EXPECTING YOU.
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:11.960
LOOK,
YOU DON'T LET ME DOWN.

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:25.974
YOU GOTTA KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM.

01:32:26.008 --> 01:32:28.076
DON'T WANT HIM
TO SLIP FURTHER INTO, UH...

01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:31.747
I'LL DO MY BEST, DOC,
BUT HE KEEPS PUSHING ME AWAY.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.082
YEAH.

01:32:34.116 --> 01:32:35.984
WE CAN ONLY OFFER CHOICES.

01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:39.655
THANK YOU.

01:32:39.688 --> 01:32:41.624
THANK YOU, SIR.

01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:14.182
JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.729
NO, I'M JUST--
JUST LOOKING.

01:34:29.197 --> 01:34:32.300
AS OF NOW, THE DOORS TO THIS
PLACE ARE NO LONGER OPEN TO YOU.

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:35.070
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE ANYMORE
TILL YOU GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:37.305
THAT'S NOT COOL, MAN.

01:34:43.879 --> 01:34:46.749
LOOK, KID,
GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILY.

01:34:46.782 --> 01:34:48.784
YOU HAVEN'T CROSSED
ANY LINES YET.

01:34:57.225 --> 01:34:59.728
MR. FAZIO...

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:05.834
I'M SORRY.

01:35:26.889 --> 01:35:30.158
WHEN DID YOU
GET IN LAST NIGHT?

01:35:30.192 --> 01:35:32.895
DON'T KNOW.
DON'T CARE.

01:35:35.497 --> 01:35:38.333
JOEY, YOU REALLY NEED
TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:40.335
GET PAST THIS.

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:41.937
I KNOW THAT MAX
WAS YOUR DEAR FRIEND,

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:43.972
BUT YOU HAVE
TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:35:44.006 --> 01:35:46.942
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:50.245
I KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON.

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:53.381
I KNOW THAT YOU DID IT ONCE
BEFORE AND YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:02.024
I DON'T THINK
I CAN MOVE ON.

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:05.527
YES, YOU CAN.

01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:08.831
LISTEN, JOE.

01:36:08.864 --> 01:36:10.933
YOU NEED TO TAKE CHARGE
OF YOUR LIFE.

01:36:10.966 --> 01:36:12.567
NOBODY ELSE
CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.569
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.304
I'M SCARED.

01:36:16.338 --> 01:36:20.242
WHY DON'T WE
EASE INTO THINGS?

01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:22.344
SHAVE, GET DRESSED,

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:26.148
THAT'LL BE THE FIRST STEP.
SMALL STEPS.

01:36:27.883 --> 01:36:30.785
SURE.
SMALL STEPS.

01:36:36.191 --> 01:36:37.592
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.062
- CAN WE TALK?
- ABOUT WHAT?

01:36:40.095 --> 01:36:41.563
HAVEN'T YOU HURT ME ENOUGH?

01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:45.233
LOOK, I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SUCH A JERK, ALL RIGHT?

01:36:45.267 --> 01:36:47.970
I DON'T KNOW, JOE.

01:36:48.003 --> 01:36:50.105
I CAN'T LET YOU
KEEP STEPPING ON ME.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:52.841
I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?
AND I'M SORRY.

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:54.877
I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD TALK.

01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:57.179
- I DON'T KNOW.
- DIDN'T YOU ONCE TELL ME

01:36:57.212 --> 01:36:58.947
I SHOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH
THIS ALL ALONE?

01:37:05.888 --> 01:37:07.890
COME IN.

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:37.585
I DID THINGS THERE
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:40.989
YOU KNOW, THINGS
I CAN'T GET OUTTA MY HEAD.

01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:43.558
I'M SORRY
I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU.

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:47.162
I STUCK WITH YOU
ALL THIS TIME

01:37:47.195 --> 01:37:49.932
AND YOU STILL FEEL THAT YOU
HAVE TO HIDE THINGS FROM ME?

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:53.535
JOE, YOU NEED
TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:58.606
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS
YOU SHOULDN'T HEAR.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:01.543
WELL, I WANT TO HEAR IT ALL.

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:04.579
HELLO?

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.148
- YEAH, RAYMOND.
- YEAH.

01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:07.449
DOCTOR GALANTE HERE.

01:38:07.482 --> 01:38:08.917
HEY, DOC,
HOW ARE YOU?

01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:10.452
I WAS CURIOUS,
IS JOSEPH HOME?

01:38:10.485 --> 01:38:12.387
NO, HE WENT
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.956
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

01:38:13.989 --> 01:38:16.058
NO, NO, NO,
HE MISSED HIS APPOINTMENT.

01:38:16.091 --> 01:38:18.293
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT.

01:38:20.195 --> 01:38:22.030
HEY, JOE,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:38:22.064 --> 01:38:23.431
- HOW'S THINGS GOIN'?
- HEY, MAN. GOOD, MAN, THANKS.

01:38:23.465 --> 01:38:26.168
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

01:38:26.201 --> 01:38:29.204
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, GOOD.
THAT'S ENCOURAGING.

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:31.406
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEN.
JUST HAVE HIM CALL

01:38:31.439 --> 01:38:33.708
AND RESCHEDULE?

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:38.146
LOOK, I TOLD YOU THINGS
I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH.

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.714
I DON'T WANT YOU
THINKING OF ME DIFFERENTLY.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:42.284
NO.

01:38:42.317 --> 01:38:44.586
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

01:38:44.619 --> 01:38:46.354
I'M GLAD
YOU OPENED UP TO ME.

01:38:46.388 --> 01:38:49.691
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CAME AT YOU
LIKE THAT, AND, WELL,

01:38:49.724 --> 01:38:54.029
- IT'S OVER NOW.
- IS IT?

01:38:54.062 --> 01:38:58.700
SOMETIMES WHEN THINGS ARE BROKE,
THEY CAN BE FIXED.

01:38:58.733 --> 01:39:01.703
YOU'RE LEARNING
TO LIVE WITH IT?

01:39:01.736 --> 01:39:03.738
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING LATELY.

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:06.441
OH, YEAH?
ABOUT WHAT?

01:39:06.474 --> 01:39:09.244
ABOUT BEING A HUSBAND
AND A FATHER.

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:12.080
I THINK I WOULD HAVE
BEEN GOOD AT IT.

01:39:12.114 --> 01:39:13.515
I THINK SO, TOO.

01:39:13.548 --> 01:39:15.350
I'VE MISSED THIS,
YOU KNOW.

01:39:15.383 --> 01:39:18.486
I'VE-- I'VE MISSED US.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.188
TALKING ABOUT A FAMILY AND...

01:39:20.222 --> 01:39:22.190
I DON'T WANT
TO PUT MY COAT ON.

01:39:22.224 --> 01:39:23.625
ONE DAY YOU'LL
HAVE YOUR OWN KIDS.

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:25.527
THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.729
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.
YOU SHOULD TRY 'EM.

01:39:36.038 --> 01:39:39.574
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- OKAY.

01:40:11.439 --> 01:40:13.141
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE?
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!

01:40:23.085 --> 01:40:24.786
FOX MAIN, FOX MAIN,
FOX 2-2 IS IN CONTACT

01:40:24.819 --> 01:40:26.188
