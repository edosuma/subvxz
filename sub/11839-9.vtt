WEBVTT

00:18.786 --> 00:20.285
>> CHARLIE: We think it's a
sinkhole! It's awesome!

00:20.287 --> 00:21.387
>> DENNIS: It's really not
that awesome.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.988
>> MAC: It's blowing my mind!

00:22.990 --> 00:24.723
>> How is a hole in the ground
blowing your mind?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.191
>> DEE: Look, I was a little bit
skeptical at first, too, but

00:26.193 --> 00:27.526
we've been playing with this

00:27.528 --> 00:29.294
thing for three hours now,
and it's fantastic.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.863
>> I'm sorry, can I ask how do
you play with a goddamn hole?

00:30.865 --> 00:32.631
>> First, we just started, like,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.299
throwing things down it and
then we never heard it land.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.135
It would just kind of rattle
around down there.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.136
>> Then we got a flashlight to

00:37.138 --> 00:38.137
see if we could see the bottom.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.138
We couldn't.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.139
Then I threw it down there, you

00:40.141 --> 00:41.140
know, to prove a point.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.141
>> What was the point?

00:42.143 --> 00:43.142
>> It was something to do with

00:43.144 --> 00:44.143
how metal travels faster than

00:44.145 --> 00:45.144
light or...?

00:45.146 --> 00:46.211
>> No, it was that light is

00:46.213 --> 00:47.513
either on or off.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.847
There's no speed to light.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.316
It's, it was an anti-science
thing.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.317
>> This hole, it's very

00:52.319 --> 00:53.318
exciting, Dennis.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.319
I mean, it represents infinite

00:54.321 --> 00:55.888
possibilities. It's endless.

00:55.890 --> 00:56.889
>> What if there's, like, a

00:56.891 --> 00:57.890
mutant living down there?

00:57.892 --> 00:58.891
We can get him up and he can

00:58.893 --> 01:00.059
live in the bar with us.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.060
>> We've already got one mutant

01:01.062 --> 01:02.061
hanging out with us in the bar

01:02.063 --> 01:03.062
all the time.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.897
(laughter)

01:04.899 --> 01:06.899
Hey, Frank, did you hear what I
said?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.000
I turned a frustrating

01:08.002 --> 01:09.334
conversation into a joke on you.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.402
>> The, uh... thing.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.670
>> FRANK: Huh? Oh, y-yeah.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.671
>> Frank, what do you think

01:12.673 --> 01:13.672
about this hole?

01:13.674 --> 01:14.673
Pretty cool, huh?

01:14.675 --> 01:15.674
You want to do something

01:15.676 --> 01:16.675
with it?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.177
>> No. I don't.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.178
In fact, something just dawned

01:19.180 --> 01:20.512
on me.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.014
I need to quit.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.415
>> Wha-What? What are, what are

01:23.417 --> 01:24.583
you talking about?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.684
>> I don't care anything about

01:25.686 --> 01:26.752
this hole.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.554
I-I'm passionless.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.689
>> What are you saying, Frank?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.091
>> I hereby officially retire

01:32.093 --> 01:34.593
from Paddy's Pub.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.167
(all cheering)

02:06.660 --> 02:08.627
>> All right, now, with Frank
retiring, I know we're all a

02:08.629 --> 02:10.662
little bit concerned about how
that affects everyone's shares.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.231
Frank owned 51% of Paddy's Pub

02:12.233 --> 02:13.966
and we own 46%.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.667
Well, we did, not-not Dee.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.236
She-she doesn't own shit.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.571
>> Yeah, I know. Goddamn it.
>> Yeah, yeah.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.473
And, Charlie, you actually gave
up most of your shares for

02:21.475 --> 02:22.474
various sandwiches and snacks

02:22.476 --> 02:23.976
and sundries and things.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.077
>> What the hell is a Franquito?

02:25.079 --> 02:26.145
It says Franquito owns three

02:26.147 --> 02:27.146
percent of Paddy's Pub?

02:27.148 --> 02:28.147
>> Oh, yeah, I don't know.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.481
That's probably one of Frank's

02:29.483 --> 02:30.649
weird shell corporations.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.151
It doesn't matter.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.153
Who gives a shit?
It's only three percent.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.654
Whoever gets Frank's 51% is the
majority shareholder.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.589
That is who controls the bar.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.993
That is who gets the throne.
>> Oh, there-there's a throne?

02:40.995 --> 02:43.162
>> Oh, sorry. No, I was just
referring to the desk chair as

02:43.164 --> 02:44.963
the throne 'cause that's where
the boss man sits.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.832
>> Ugh, gross. That chair smells
like Frank's butt.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.535
>> It's not actually
Frank's butt; I think it's a

02:49.537 --> 02:51.436
combination of all of our butt
smells, you know?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.438
>> That's worse.
>> Yeah.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.440
>> Why would anybody want
that chair?

02:55.442 --> 02:56.441
>> No, no, it's not about the

02:56.443 --> 02:57.442
chair itself.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.443
It's what the chair represents.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.678
The chair represents power.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.679
>> Okay, well, all right.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.680
How do we divvy up Frank's

03:01.682 --> 03:02.781
shares then?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.716
>> Uh... Okay, well, um...

03:04.718 --> 03:06.718
I'll-I'll take them.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.886
>> You? You?

03:07.888 --> 03:08.887
You think we're gonna give the

03:08.889 --> 03:09.888
shares to the man who wants to

03:09.890 --> 03:10.889
pull a mutant from a mystery

03:10.891 --> 03:11.890
hole in the bar and live

03:11.892 --> 03:12.891
with him?

03:12.893 --> 03:13.892
>> All right, well, look, I'm

03:13.894 --> 03:15.894
just trying to come up with a
system.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.895
We got to have a system here...

03:16.897 --> 03:17.896
>> Wait, wait, wait, wait!

03:17.898 --> 03:18.897
We do have a system for this!

03:18.899 --> 03:20.899
Paddy's Succession Plan,
remember?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.134
>> Oh, shit! Right.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.135
Yes, right!

03:23.137 --> 03:24.136
Paddy's Succession Plan.

03:24.138 --> 03:25.537
It was like a will that we drew

03:25.539 --> 03:27.039
up to help us determine who

03:27.041 --> 03:28.240
would get each one of our shares

03:28.242 --> 03:29.908
in the very likely event of

03:29.910 --> 03:32.144
our untimely deaths, that's
right.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.145
>> We drank, like, three bottles

03:33.147 --> 03:34.146
of tequila and then we started

03:34.148 --> 03:35.147
talking about our legacy and how

03:35.149 --> 03:36.215
important that was to us.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.316
>> Oh! Got to have a legacy.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.317
>> Oh, here we go.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.318
>> Oh, oh! Yeah, okay.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.319
>> On a paper plate, huh?

03:40.321 --> 03:41.320
>> Read it! Read it! Read it!

03:41.322 --> 03:42.321
Read it!

03:42.323 --> 03:43.322
>> "Paddy's succession plan.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.323
Paddy's Pub shall secure our

03:44.325 --> 03:45.724
legacy here, henceforth and

03:45.726 --> 03:47.059
forevermore throughout the

03:47.061 --> 03:48.227
birthright of our firstborn kin.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.328
Who had the pen here?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.329
>> It makes sense.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.330
Don't be a bitch.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.331
What it means is every one of

03:52.333 --> 03:53.732
our shares gets passed down to

03:53.734 --> 03:55.167
our firstborn.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.902
>> Right, right! Our firstborn!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.270
>> The shares get passed down to

03:58.272 --> 03:59.271
the firstborn kin?

03:59.273 --> 04:00.272
>> Yeah.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.274
>> We are the firstborn kin of
Frank.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.275
>> Well, now, hang on, that's

04:03.277 --> 04:04.343
not, like, an official document.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.344
>> Uh, well, you signed it in

04:05.346 --> 04:06.345
your blood.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.346
>> Oh, that, yeah, there it is--

04:07.348 --> 04:08.347
"Trundle," written in blood.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.348
>> Oh, yeah, I was going by

04:09.350 --> 04:10.349
Trundle at the time, wasn't I?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.350
>> No, no, no. You were trying

04:11.352 --> 04:12.351
to write "Charlie" and you wrote

04:12.353 --> 04:13.352
"Trundle."

04:13.354 --> 04:14.353
>> No, I was going by "Trundle

04:14.355 --> 04:15.354
the Great."

04:15.356 --> 04:16.355
>> You came up with that after

04:16.357 --> 04:17.356
you miswrote it.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.357
>> Well, look, the point is you

04:18.359 --> 04:19.424
can't just take the bar based on

04:19.426 --> 04:20.425
a paper plate.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.426
>> Sorry, Charlie.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.195
I'm siding with Dennis and Dee.

04:23.197 --> 04:24.963
I'm your humble servant.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.965
>> You're just gonna give it to
them?!

04:26.967 --> 04:27.966
>> That's a binding contract.

04:27.968 --> 04:28.967
Okay? You wrote it in blood.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.035
That's gonna hold up in a court

04:30.037 --> 04:32.037
of law and I know when to pick a
side.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.038
I'm siding with Dennis and Dee.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.039
>> Wait, hold on a second.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.040
You guys aren't even actually

04:35.042 --> 04:36.475
Frank's kid.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.777
You're Bruce Mathis' kid, all
right?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.945
And I technically might be

04:39.947 --> 04:41.446
Frank's kid.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.382
>> Charlie, I pledge my

04:43.384 --> 04:44.549
allegiance to you.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.617
>> No, no, no, no.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.618
Wait a second, no.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.619
But Frank is a Reynolds and we

04:47.621 --> 04:48.620
are Reynolds.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.621
>> Yup, we're Reynolds.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.622
>> Yeah, and it's the name that

04:50.624 --> 04:51.790
carries on the line, not maybe

04:51.792 --> 04:53.225
being someone's bastard kid.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.960
>> It was always you guys.

04:54.962 --> 04:55.961
I tricked him, I tricked him.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.129
It was always you.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.563
>> It is the blood that binds.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.132
And his blood is pumping through

05:00.134 --> 05:01.500
my veins.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.335
And I shall prove it.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.103
(door opens, closes)
>> This is a little bit harder

05:05.105 --> 05:06.438
because he might win 'cause he
has some good points.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.407
But you guys might win...

05:08.409 --> 05:10.409
>> We don't give a shit about
what you're talking about!

05:10.411 --> 05:13.312
>> It doesn't matter, it doesn't
matter.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.815
(sizzling)

05:16.817 --> 05:18.650
(panting)

05:18.652 --> 05:20.419
>> Hey-o! There's my guy!

05:20.421 --> 05:21.753
Hey, I got a piping hot Grilled

05:21.755 --> 05:22.754
Frank for you, okay?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.756
I got the sausage, the Spam, the
bacon.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.757
I got it wrapped in a jelly

05:25.759 --> 05:26.758
pancake and cooked with a stick

05:26.760 --> 05:27.759
of butter.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.827
>> I don't want that, Charlie.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.762
I'm trying to get in shape.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.497
I read all about this phenomenon

05:32.499 --> 05:34.666
that guys' bodies immediately

05:34.668 --> 05:38.103
turn to shit the second they
retire.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.938
>> Oh, yeah?
>> I got to work on it.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.106
>> All right, well, you know,

05:41.108 --> 05:42.207
just-just take a peek, see if

05:42.209 --> 05:43.208
you like it.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.343
Uh, hey, listen, man, can I ask

05:44.345 --> 05:45.344
you something?

05:45.346 --> 05:46.611
>> (grunts) What?

05:46.613 --> 05:49.981
>> Are you, like, um... my dad?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.616
>> What?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.618
>> Are, like... are you the-the
father of me and shit?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.654
>> We've-we've been over this.
>> Yeah.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.289
>> Your mother's a giant whore.
>> Right.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.291
>> I don't want to stress about
this, Charlie.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.027
I'm retired. Leave me alone.
I want to watch a little TV.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.029
>> Yeah. All right.
>> Charlie, hey... Oh.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.031
Hey, can I talk to you for a
sec?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.032
>> Uh, yeah. Hey.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.301
>> Hey, um, I came up with a

06:09.303 --> 06:10.369
really great idea, dude.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.370
>> Yeah?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.638
>> I'm gonna play both sides.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.807
>> Why would you tell me that?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.876
>> Should I not have?
>> Probably shouldn't 'cause if

06:17.878 --> 06:19.711
you're trying to keep a secret
from me, well, now I know.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.179
>> I should've... Should I tell
them?

06:21.181 --> 06:22.314
>> No, I don't think you should

06:22.316 --> 06:23.315
tell either side 'cause if you

06:23.317 --> 06:24.383
try to play both sides and they

06:24.385 --> 06:25.384
both know, you're not playing
anybody.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.985
>> What should I do now?

06:26.987 --> 06:29.654
>> I don't... I don't give a
shit. Why are you here?

06:29.656 --> 06:31.656
>> I'm here to prove my
allegiance to you.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.658
Because I believe that you're
the rightful heir.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.560
>> Okay, whatever.
>> All right, well, I see... I

06:35.562 --> 06:37.396
see that you don't believe me.
>> Why would I?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.498
>> So I am prepared to take a
blood oath with you.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.233
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

06:41.235 --> 06:43.268
>> Oh, my God, dude!
Oh, that was Frank's toe knife!

06:43.270 --> 06:44.870
>> Oh, it hurts so much.
All right, quick, shake on it.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.871
>> No, I'm not gonna touch your
blood.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.172
>> Do you have something I

06:47.174 --> 06:48.173
could... I got to close this
wound.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.908
>> Yeah, here, just plug it up.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.843
>> That was so not as cool
as I thought it was gonna be.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.845
>> That sock's probably gonna
get it more infected, though.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.348
>> All right, look, look, look,
look, dude.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.450
We got to prove that Frank is
your dad.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.885
>> Dude, he-he doesn't even want

06:59.887 --> 07:01.553
to have that conversation with
me, okay?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.422
And he's certainly not gonna get
tested, you know?

07:03.424 --> 07:04.623
He's really resistant to the
whole thing.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.291
>> (sighs) All right, well, then

07:06.293 --> 07:07.859
we're gonna have to do some
testing of our own.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.928
>> Yeah?
>> I can choke a man out in four

07:09.930 --> 07:12.931
seconds flat.
>> Oh, yeah?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.801
Yeah, I guess we could try that,
or, uh... >> All right.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.469
>> You know, I could probably
take his blood right now.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.371
He's out.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.472
>> He's staring right at us.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.640
>> Yeah, he's been falling

07:21.642 --> 07:22.641
asleep with his eyes open like

07:22.643 --> 07:23.875
that, but he's way out.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.277
I mean, we could prick him.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.479
He won't feel a thing. Frank!

07:32.653 --> 07:33.752
(sniffing)

07:33.754 --> 07:35.620
>> Anything?
>> Nothing!

07:35.622 --> 07:37.289
Not a single butt smell to that.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.124
How is that possible?
>> I don't know.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.659
It's either this guy's butt or
this brand of chair.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.260
>> It's got to be the brand,
right?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.095
>> All right, we got to get one
of these for our throne.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.764
>> Yeah. Yeah. Hey!
>> Hey!

07:45.766 --> 07:48.166
Hey, what do you say, Doc?
So, what is the verdict?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.936
Is Frank Charlie's dad or not?
>> I don't know.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.438
I don't know who that is.
What I do know is I came to work

07:53.440 --> 07:55.340
this morning to find a very
large bucket of blood in my lab.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.275
>> Yeah, well, that's the

07:57.277 --> 07:59.578
sample, obviously, and, uh, you
know, if it's too big, it's

07:59.580 --> 08:01.446
because Frank sprung a little
bit of a leak there.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.281
>> Yeah, it was a mess, huh?

08:03.283 --> 08:05.016
>> He was bleeding like crazy.
>> There was blood everywhere,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.685
but we caught enough of it, I
think.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.687
>> Yeah, we must have cut a
deep vein or something.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.288
>> Wait a second.
Most of this came from one man?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.790
>> Did we take too much?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.658
I-I didn't think that we took
too much.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.960
>> Yes. You took too much.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.661
Also, there's traces of more

08:16.663 --> 08:17.863
than four individuals in here

08:17.865 --> 08:19.831
and at least one animal.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.634
Was there blood in the bucket
before?

08:22.636 --> 08:23.802
>> It is a blood bucket,

08:23.804 --> 08:24.870
so yeah, there was old blood.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.137
>> I didn't come here to get

08:26.139 --> 08:27.138
sassed, okay?

08:27.140 --> 08:28.206
I came here to get an answer to

08:28.208 --> 08:29.341
my question.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.142
So is Frank Charlie's dad or
not?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.178
>> The only thing that I can
tell you is that, based off of

08:33.180 --> 08:34.212
how much blood is in this

08:34.214 --> 08:35.313
bucket, your friend is in

08:35.315 --> 08:37.716
desperate need of blood.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.319
>> All right, Dee, the bar is

08:41.321 --> 08:42.320
finally ours.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.355
Let's talk redecoration.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.556
>> Well, I'm thinking chrome,

08:44.558 --> 08:46.658
and I'm thinking chrome
everywhere.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.859
The other thing that's important

08:47.861 --> 08:49.194
to me is a proper dance floor.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.662
That way, any time I want to

08:50.664 --> 08:52.063
just pop a boogie, I can do it

08:52.065 --> 08:53.365
wherever I am, and it won't be

08:53.367 --> 08:54.399
weird, you know what I mean?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.700
>> Okay.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.869
>> (raspy): Oh, think of it,
brother.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.870
With them out of the way,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.171
we can do as we please.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.508
Two butts, one throne.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.810
>> All right, you know what,
you've been doing this all day.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.345
Why are you talking like that?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.880
>> I'm just being... I'm being
arch.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.715
>> Why?
>> Well, because we're being

09:10.717 --> 09:12.851
devious and we're plotting, and
I just wanted to make sure that

09:12.853 --> 09:14.819
it was clear that we were
devious and plotting.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.488
>> You don't need to indicate to
me that you're being devious

09:16.490 --> 09:17.522
when you're actually
being devious.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.424
>> I guess I had some concerns

09:19.426 --> 09:21.359
that you wouldn't pick up on it
if I didn't make it super clear.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.561
>> Yeah, but the problem is if
you start doing that,

09:22.563 --> 09:24.029
everybody's gonna pick up on it.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.530
And that defeats the purpose.
>> Yeah, got it.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.032
>> Dennis, Dee, quickly-- we

09:27.034 --> 09:28.033
don't have much time.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.534
Charlie and I doctored a

09:29.536 --> 09:30.602
paternity test to make it look

09:30.604 --> 09:32.537
like Frank is Charlie's dad.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.939
But the tests were actually

09:33.941 --> 09:35.206
inconclusive; there was too much

09:35.208 --> 09:36.541
blood in the bucket to tell.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.876
The reason I'm telling you all

09:37.878 --> 09:38.944
this is because I'm playing

09:38.946 --> 09:40.278
both sides so that I always come

09:40.280 --> 09:41.413
out on top.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.281
So, with this information, I'm

09:43.283 --> 09:44.382
gonna leverage you guys into

09:44.384 --> 09:45.550
making me the head of security

09:45.552 --> 09:46.618
at the new Paddy's Pub.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.619
>> Mm.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.887
>> O-Okay, okay, couple things

09:48.889 --> 09:49.888
right off the bat, there, pal.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.222
Number one, um, never tell one

09:51.224 --> 09:52.290
side that you're playing both
sides.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.225
>> Yeah.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.695
>> And number two, if you are
gonna play both sides, don't

09:56.697 --> 09:59.230
give away the information before
you get what you want.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.900
>> Oh, shit. Right, don't give
away the in-information.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.468
>> Yeah.
>> All right, well, if I am

10:03.470 --> 10:05.036
gonna play both sides, what
should I do?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.104
>> Oops.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.105
>> You're still telling us that

10:07.107 --> 10:08.139
you're playing both sides, so

10:08.141 --> 10:09.240
why would we help you?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.408
>> Uh... Okay, well, what if I

10:10.410 --> 10:11.409
make a blood oath...

10:11.411 --> 10:12.410
uh, allegiance to you guys?

10:12.412 --> 10:14.079
>> Oh!
>> Ooh.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.080
>> Gross.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.247
>> Yeah, I, uh, I sliced it with

10:16.249 --> 10:17.916
Frank's toe knife and, uh, it's

10:17.918 --> 10:19.784
not bleeding anymore, but maybe
I could...

10:19.786 --> 10:21.453
Oh, yeah, here, I'll just get it
again.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.554
>> Oh!

10:22.556 --> 10:23.955
>> Oh, shit!
>> Oh, God!

10:23.957 --> 10:25.757
>> Jesus, dude, that was the
lime knife.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.392
>> Oh, I feel that-- it stings.
Oh, Dee, here, shake my hand.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.793
>> No, get away from me, gross.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.795
>> Aah. Dennis?
>> No, your blood is disgusting.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.664
>> Aah. What should I do?
>> Go to the doctor.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.432
>> Mac, why the hell'd you
sprint ahead of me, man?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.468
>> Oh, 'cause I'm playing both
sides.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.103
>> Jesus Christ.
>> Wow.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.804
>> It doesn't matter.
Okay, guys, I got some

10:39.806 --> 10:41.606
documentation here proving that
I am the rightful heir to

10:41.608 --> 10:43.274
Frank's butt chair.
>> Yeah.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.843
>> All right, Charlie, save it,
save it.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.478
Mac already told us that that's

10:46.480 --> 10:48.113
not a real paternity test.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.115
>> What the hell, dude?
You swore a blood oath to me.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.116
>> Dude, you never touched my

10:51.118 --> 10:52.117
blood, okay?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.118
>> All right, you know what, if

10:53.120 --> 10:54.653
you really want to work here...

10:54.655 --> 10:55.954
kick Charlie out of here.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.322
>> Hmm.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.456
>> Really?
>> Mm-hmm.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.624
>> No problem, dude.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.993
Charlie, let's go, bud, get...

11:01.995 --> 11:03.628
All right, dude, I'm gonna carry
you out.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.030
(exclaims, grunts)

11:05.032 --> 11:07.032
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God, he is so heavy.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.633
He's, like, grounding himself
with something.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.035
Oh, now he's going limp.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.037
No, come on, dude, that's not
fair.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.938
Help me out, here, Charlie.
Help me out.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.707
That's it, dude, that's it.
I'm choking you out.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.808
>> Okay.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.809
>> You're going out, dude,

11:17.811 --> 11:19.144
you're going to sleep.

11:19.146 --> 11:23.982
Good night, dude, good night,
bitch.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.485
(exhales)

11:27.487 --> 11:29.020
>> Your head of security just

11:29.022 --> 11:30.121
choked himself out.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.190
(Dennis sighs)

11:35.662 --> 11:37.662
>> Hey, Frank, I know you're

11:37.664 --> 11:38.830
trying to be healthy, so I got

11:38.832 --> 11:39.898
you a hoagie with extra pickles

11:39.900 --> 11:41.166
in it-- I figured you could use

11:41.168 --> 11:42.167
the veggies and stuff...

11:42.169 --> 11:43.835
Oh, shit!

11:43.837 --> 11:45.537
>> Hi, Charlie.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.539
>> What... What's going on with
you, man?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.841
>> I forgot to dye my hair this
morning.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.176
>> What's up with your teeth?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.343
>> I was eating some of

11:52.345 --> 11:54.846
Deandra's pyramid scheme
berries.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.181
I was trying to get healthy.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.182
>> Right.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.184
>> I feel a little light-headed.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.519
>> All right, well, I'm sure
it's nothing, you know.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.521
Probably just, like, tired from
working hard and then...

12:03.523 --> 12:05.256
You know, the body crashes
when...

12:05.258 --> 12:06.858
O-Oh, shit, did you fall asleep
again?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.859
(snoring)

12:07.861 --> 12:09.427
Frank?
>> Is he dead?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.895
>> Oh, shit.
>> He looks bad.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.697
>> What are you sneaking up on
me for?

12:12.699 --> 12:14.566
>> Oh, listen, Dennis is acting
weird and I don't like it.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.367
Now, I know he's got something
planned, but he's not

12:16.369 --> 12:17.736
indicating, so I don't know what
it is.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.037
>> Right.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.705
No, I get that, I guess, so,
yeah.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.107
>> (raspy): Yes, yes, exactly,

12:22.109 --> 12:24.542
Charlie, so here's the plan: we

12:24.544 --> 12:25.777
need to outsmart him before he

12:25.779 --> 12:27.245
can have us murdered...

12:27.247 --> 12:28.913
>> Are you okay?
>> ...and throw us in... Hmm?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.682
>> Do you need a glass of water
or something?

12:30.684 --> 12:31.950
>> (normal voice): No, I'm good.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.518
>> What are... W-What's
happening?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.053
>> I'm... I'm being arch.
>> Oh. Oh.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.122
>> We're doing a thing together,
so you know...

12:37.124 --> 12:39.023
>> Yeah, no, I know, just 'cause
you're telling me what's up.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.592
>> Okay, okay, fine.
The point is we got to prove

12:40.594 --> 12:41.693
that you're the rightful heir
to the throne.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.561
>> Yes, of course, that's why I

12:43.563 --> 12:45.096
got this plastic bag, 'cause my
blood bucket was inconclusive.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.431
>> You just need a couple drops.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.233
>> Right, yeah.
>> So let's open him up.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.135
>> Yeah, all right, but you
know, we got to be careful, you

12:50.137 --> 12:51.903
know, 'cause I think I took too
much blood last time.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.404
>> Is that what's going on?
>> Yeah.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.106
>> Okay, well, you just need a
couple drops.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.307
>> Yeah, all right, just a
prick, just a little prick.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.143
>> Just a prick. Okay.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.411
>> Oh, my God, so much blood!
Oh, so much blood, I think we

13:00.413 --> 13:02.647
hit an artery, Dee, look at
this. >> Yeah.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.449
>> Oh, shit.
>> Is he okay?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.451
>> No, he's okay, you know, the
duct tape'll stop it.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.453
Okay, let's just get...
Wait, oh, shit, this is leaking.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.088
>> Oh, no.
Oh, shit, I'm holding it...

13:10.090 --> 13:12.323
>> Wait, wait, stop, stop!
Oh, damn it.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.492
>> Shoot, Charlie, I'm sorry,
I was trying to help.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.494
Can't imagine it was gonna be a
very good sample anyway-- there

13:16.496 --> 13:18.163
are quite a few pickles floating
around in that bag.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.798
>> Yeah, what I was thinking.
>> Shit.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.299
>> Wait a second-- which one of

13:21.301 --> 13:22.801
you and Dennis was firstborn?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.602
>> We're twins.
>> No, I know, I know, but,

13:24.604 --> 13:25.804
like, who did Barbara actually,

13:25.806 --> 13:26.805
like, pop out first?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.106
>> Oh, shit.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.141
Oh, Charlie.
"Worst is first!"

13:30.143 --> 13:31.409
>> What is that?
>> "Worst is first."

13:31.411 --> 13:33.144
My mom used to say that to me

13:33.146 --> 13:35.313
all the time because I was first
and she thought I was the worst.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.315
>> Holy shit, that's terrible,
but that's good for us.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.950
>> Yeah! Yeah!
>> Okay, so that means you're

13:38.952 --> 13:40.251
the rightful heir to the butt
chair.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.319
So, all right, we can work with
that.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.188
All right, let's get out of

13:43.190 --> 13:45.190
here, come on, we can't tell
anybody about this, all right?

13:45.192 --> 13:48.927
>> Okay, okay. >> Let's...
All right, let's just go.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.799
>> Always hated these.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.034
So that's gonna change.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.202
>> Worst is first, dude, worst

13:57.204 --> 13:58.636
is first.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.638
>> What are you talking about,
man?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.841
>> Dee is conspiring against
you.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.309
Charlie figured it out.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.177
"Worst is first."

14:06.179 --> 14:07.712
Charlie and Dee were getting

14:07.714 --> 14:08.880
blood from Frank when Charlie

14:08.882 --> 14:11.683
realized Dee was born first.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.518
Therefore, she's the rightful
heir.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.054
Then I got a little bit more
blood from Frank, 'cause I feel

14:16.056 --> 14:17.856
like we're probably gonna use it
in the future and he was already

14:17.858 --> 14:18.957
opened up, so who gives a shit?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.325
>> Okay, all right.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.726
How'd you get all this
information?

14:21.728 --> 14:22.994
>> I was hiding in Frank's

14:22.996 --> 14:24.362
apartment, and then they went

14:24.364 --> 14:25.530
out into the hallway and I heard

14:25.532 --> 14:26.831
them through the door.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.066
Dude, the best part is I'm gonna

14:28.068 --> 14:29.667
use this information to leverage

14:29.669 --> 14:31.069
you into giving me a better

14:31.071 --> 14:32.403
position under your reign.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.671
>> You just told me the infor...

14:33.673 --> 14:34.672
You know what?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.341
Forget it.
Good job.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.742
Um, how about the position of my
pawn, how's that sound?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.410
>> Pawn.
>> Yeah.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.645
>> Pawns are cool, there's a lot
of them, you know.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.513
They move diagonally.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.415
I've always thought that I move
a little bit too much forward

14:44.417 --> 14:45.416
and back and I should be more

14:45.418 --> 14:46.684
like... like...

14:46.686 --> 14:47.752
'Cause then, you can't see me

14:47.754 --> 14:48.853
if I'm coming at you like this.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.722
Like, sideways.
Well, watch.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.990
Well, don't move your head,
dude.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.191
All right, what if you keep your

14:53.193 --> 14:54.592
head there but close your
eyes...

14:54.594 --> 14:55.593
>> You know, it doesn't matter.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.930
I need you to do something for
me.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.372
>> Oh... oh, my God.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.773
That is crazy.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.742
It's the smell of a thousand
butts.

15:10.744 --> 15:11.776
>> Hey! Dennis!

15:11.778 --> 15:13.011
Dennis, I did your bidding.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.012
>> Good.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.013
>> Yeah.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.347
Frank is on his way.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.116
But dude, whatever it is you got

15:18.118 --> 15:19.384
planned, you better do it fast,

15:19.386 --> 15:20.752
because if Dee and Charlie get

15:20.754 --> 15:22.587
that birth certificate, you're
screwed.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.422
>> Look, Mac, I told you, I've
got it under control.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.591
Everything is going according to
my plan.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.792
>> Right.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.627
>> Worst is first!
Worst is first!

15:29.629 --> 15:31.095
>> (raspy): Oh, brother, looks

15:31.097 --> 15:32.463
as though you've underest...

15:32.465 --> 15:34.299
>> Stop doing that.
It doesn't work.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.733
>> No?
>> Look, we found the birth

15:35.735 --> 15:36.968
certificate proving Dee was born
first.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.770
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Worst is first.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.471
>> Worst is first, yeah, and
then Charlie and I, we made a

15:40.473 --> 15:42.607
blood oath, so now we're
in cahoots. >> Yeah!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.108
>> Hey, Trundle, can I get in on
that?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.243
>> Ugh!
>> I'm on their side.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.778
>> Nasty.
>> You idiots.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.446
Did you not think that I had
anticipated this?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.315
While you were running around
town like lunatics, chopping

15:50.317 --> 15:51.616
your hands to bits, I did a

15:51.618 --> 15:53.117
little bit of research.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.153
Turns out Franquito isn't a

15:55.155 --> 15:56.821
shell corporation after all.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.389
He's a person.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.325
Dee, you remember Josefina, our

16:00.327 --> 16:02.393
maid from the early '80s?
>> Yeah.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.295
>> Well, it turns out Frank had
been banging her for years, and

16:04.297 --> 16:07.665
just before we were born, he
was.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.133
Franquito!

16:09.135 --> 16:12.637
<i> Ven acá!</i>

16:12.639 --> 16:13.738
>> Holy shit!

16:13.740 --> 16:15.740
>> Whoa!
>> What?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.976
>> Yeah, look upon him.
Yeah, he doesn't speak any

16:17.978 --> 16:19.811
English, by the way, so don't
try talking to him.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.979
But we worked something out.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.413
Yeah, Frank's shares go to him,

16:22.415 --> 16:23.848
'cause he's the firstborn... and

16:23.850 --> 16:26.017
then Franquito signs to me.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.487
It's game, set and match.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.255
(engine sputters)

16:31.257 --> 16:34.192
>> Holy shit.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.693
>> What is happening right now?

16:35.695 --> 16:39.097
>> I'm not... I'm not feeling so
well.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.166
Retirement is difficult.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.434
(coughs thickly)

16:43.436 --> 16:44.836
>> Anyway... hey, Frank!

16:44.838 --> 16:46.604
Guess who this is.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.672
Haven't seen him in a while,

16:47.674 --> 16:48.706
have you?

16:48.708 --> 16:51.275
♪ ♪

16:51.277 --> 16:53.344

16:55.715 --> 16:58.349
Franquito.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.219
>> Yes.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.188
Of course it is.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.059
Look how beautiful he is.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.060
Oh!

Oh!

17:14.534 --> 17:18.202
You give me so much joy right
now.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.370
>> And, so, Frank, the bar shall

17:19.372 --> 17:20.571
go to him.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.739
>> Oh!

17:21.741 --> 17:22.974
>> Just need you to sign here

17:22.976 --> 17:24.208
and here.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.576

17:25.578 --> 17:28.246
needed in the tribe, his body

betrays him.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.648

17:32.252 --> 17:34.886
blood seems to drain from his

17:37.724 --> 17:38.890
man he once was.

you're going with this, but can

you just sign?

17:46.166 --> 17:49.434
I will retain all, and Franquito

17:49.436 --> 17:51.102
will help me run the bar as my

17:51.104 --> 17:52.103
number two.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.337
Speaking of number two...

17:53.339 --> 17:54.572
(farts loudly)

17:54.574 --> 17:55.740
>> Oh!

17:55.742 --> 17:56.908

(people groaning)

17:59.279 --> 18:00.445
>> Damn it! Come on.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.679
I just cleaned that.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.914
>> That's Frank's butt smell.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.082
That is it. I told you. Oh, no!

18:04.084 --> 18:05.083
>> That is the exact smell of

18:05.085 --> 18:06.250
the chair.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.453
was before.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.620
>> No, it isn't.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.788
>> No.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.090
>> It's so much worse.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.258
>> I have my son to rule with
me.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.260
>> No, you don't.
>> What do you mean?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.463
>> Because Franquito's not your
son.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.865
I made it all up.
>> What?! How?!

18:20.867 --> 18:22.467
>> All right, look, guys, it's
very simple.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.102
Seven years ago, I walked into a

18:24.104 --> 18:26.270
Wahwah, and I saw this guy, and
I thought, "Holy shit!

18:26.272 --> 18:28.606
That guy looks just like Frank,
but, you know, Mexican."

18:28.608 --> 18:31.275
And then I came up with a plan
where I could make Frank believe

18:31.277 --> 18:33.644
that he had a son with our maid
Josefina all those years ago,

18:33.646 --> 18:36.114
and I could bilk him out of a
shitload of money under the

18:36.116 --> 18:38.950
guise that the money was all
going to his firstborn son,

18:38.952 --> 18:41.319
Franquito, when, in fact, the
money was going to me.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.721
And it worked, too.
It was a good plan.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.124
>> Yeah, but that's, like...
incredibly devious, dude.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.992
I mean, you've been screwing
Frank for years?

18:47.994 --> 18:49.727
>> I mean, you guys would

18:49.729 --> 18:52.130
have done that, too, right, if
you'd thought of it?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.332
>> Uh, I don't... I don't know.
>> I don't know, man. I mean...

18:54.334 --> 18:56.167
>> Yeah, I think you guys would
have, but, either way, it

18:56.169 --> 18:57.168
doesn't matter, you know, 'cause

18:57.170 --> 18:58.336
everything is, uh, as it should

18:58.338 --> 18:59.337
be, so let's grab some drinks.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.338
>> Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.339
>> No, no, everything is not as

19:01.341 --> 19:02.340
it should be.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.575
You tried to screw us out of the
bar.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.177
>> Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you tried

19:06.179 --> 19:08.479
to steal the bar.
>> No, no, no, no, I was trying

19:08.481 --> 19:10.414
to get things to go back to the
way they were-- get him back on

19:10.416 --> 19:12.316
the throne, and, you know, so we
could get back to doing all the

19:12.318 --> 19:13.985
things that we love to do at
Paddy's, you know, like, um,

19:13.987 --> 19:15.019
finding out what's at the bottom

19:15.021 --> 19:16.020
of a hole. Right? Did we ever?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.188
>> Shit.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.189
>> Did you guys ever find out

19:18.191 --> 19:19.190
what was at the bottom of that?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.258
>> No, we dropped it completely.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.493
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, shit, dude.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.328
There could be a<i> Goonies </i>
situation down there, right?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.430
>> That. Yeah, that's what I was
thinking, yeah.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.099
>> Yeah, we were discussing it.
You feeling better?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.034
>> You know, the hole...
The hole in the bathroom? Yeah,

19:30.036 --> 19:31.836
I feel pretty good about this.
>> Want to pee in that hole?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.838
>> All right, come on, let's go
check it out.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.706
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
>> Let's get in the bathroom.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.608
>> You want to try to flush that
thing one more time?

19:37.610 --> 19:38.709
>> Ah, the hole.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.710
>> Oh, I'm so excited things are

>> Can I get my five bucks?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.859
