a whole new life.

It's very exciting.

In college,
my dad majored
in cheerleading.

That was a joke.

Gretchen's got
a great sense of humor.

Luckily, in Gretchen's case,

not exactly someone
who's prone
to inspirational stories.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.345
Why would she lie
about changing her mind?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.081
Well,
when I was a cop,

11:54.147 --> 11:55.515
I had a lot of people
change their minds
about testifying in court,

11:55.582 --> 11:57.650
and it always came down
to one of three reasons.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.720
Fear, confusion,
or they were paid off.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.622
She doesn't seem confused.

12:02.689 --> 12:03.924
And I don't think
she's afraid.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.126
So Gretchen
was paid off?

it's a non-compliant patient.

that your dad
can't afford this surgery?

I was drawing a bath,
and I leaned over
to turn it off,

and I dropped
the pill bottle,

34:30.636 --> 34:32.271

I could fish it out...

34:32.338 --> 34:35.006
All the pills were ruined.
So you need a refill.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.808
My pain has made me
so clumsy.

be able to give you

you're gonna look like.

with Jim Ransler,

we owe him big time for this.

I can handle him.

above and beyond.

I was saving her life.

I nearly ended it.

This is the brilliant
Dr. Murphy.

He'll be assuming your care
from here on,

you'll need much.
