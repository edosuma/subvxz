to drill into a highly secure seed vault

10:21.267 --> 10:22.570
just to kill someone?

10:22.573 --> 10:23.882
If they wanted to murder Karl,

10:23.885 --> 10:25.710
there were easier ways
to make that happen.

10:25.713 --> 10:26.567
OVERSIGHT: Agreed.

10:26.569 --> 10:28.863
Drilling through the permafrost
could not have been easy.

10:28.866 --> 10:30.640
Whoever this is wanted something badly

10:30.643 --> 10:32.070
and could only find it here.

10:32.073 --> 10:33.913
Karl was collateral damage.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.663
[SIGHS] There's nothing here but seeds.

10:35.665 --> 10:36.948
My team and I checked the seal

10:36.951 --> 10:38.622
on every box, found no evidence

10:38.625 --> 10:39.928
that anything was disrupted.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.494
So if they were after seeds,

10:41.497 --> 10:43.445
- it looks like they failed.
- No, the thief wouldn't have

10:43.447 --> 10:45.361
done this if they didn't
take what they came for.

10:45.363 --> 10:46.631
He must have covered his tracks,

10:46.633 --> 10:47.893
but if we can somehow

10:47.895 --> 10:49.252
figure out what was stolen,

10:49.255 --> 10:51.678
it may help us identify
and find the guy.

10:51.681 --> 10:53.420
Yeah, but there are
millions of seeds here.

10:53.422 --> 10:55.727
Searching through every one of
these boxes could take weeks,

10:55.729 --> 10:57.119
maybe even months.
By that time the thief

10:57.121 --> 10:58.839
- and the seeds would be long gone.
- There's got to be

10:58.841 --> 11:00.299
a way to narrow down our search.

11:03.388 --> 11:05.347
Maybe there is.

11:11.701 --> 11:13.222
[GRUNTS]

11:13.224 --> 11:14.443
Here you go.

11:16.612 --> 11:18.140
Oh, it's dead.

11:18.142 --> 11:19.994
That's why they couldn't
track him before.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.583
Between the head wound
and the multiple tears

11:25.585 --> 11:28.132
on Karl's jacket, he clearly
fought with the killer.

11:28.135 --> 11:29.786
Karl must have stumbled upon the thief

11:29.789 --> 11:31.398
while he was searching
through the boxes.

11:31.401 --> 11:33.373
Yeah. Smartphones have a chip in them

11:33.375 --> 11:35.690
that runs a gyroscope, an accelerometer,

11:35.693 --> 11:37.408
and an electromagnetic
compass, meaning...

11:37.411 --> 11:40.509
The phone is constantly recording
where it is in three-dimensional space.

11:40.512 --> 11:42.338
So it recorded all of Karl's movements

11:42.341 --> 11:44.165
- during the fight.
- Exactly.

11:44.168 --> 11:45.515
MATTY: Mac, you think
you could figure out

11:45.517 --> 11:46.778
where the thief was

11:46.780 --> 11:48.554
based on the information
on Karl's phone?

11:48.557 --> 11:50.738
MACGYVER: Yes, with
Riley guiding us through,

11:50.740 --> 11:52.218
Desi and I can recreate the fight,

11:52.220 --> 11:53.262
starting at the end.

11:53.264 --> 11:55.166
When our thief dragged Karl

11:55.169 --> 11:56.890
- into the tunnel.
- So, working backwards,

11:56.893 --> 11:58.703
we'll be able to
pinpoint where the thief

11:58.705 --> 12:00.269
was standing when Karl first found him.

12:00.271 --> 12:01.621
Huh. Not bad.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.841
So, who's playing Karl?

12:09.716 --> 12:11.106
Seriously?

12:11.108 --> 12:13.631
Just trying to be fair.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.328

12:15.330 --> 12:18.287

12:20.683 --> 12:22.378
Put that in your pocket.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.467
Same place as Karl had
it when you found it.

12:24.469 --> 12:27.993
Thank you. That way I can
match Karl's movements to yours.

12:27.995 --> 12:30.691
DESI: Oh, hey, Mac.

12:30.693 --> 12:32.042
Assume the position.

12:39.963 --> 12:41.312
Comfy?

12:42.313 --> 12:43.663
Never better.

12:48.188 --> 12:50.667
- Okay, I'm ready.
- So, Karl's phone

12:50.670 --> 12:52.147
was horizontal.

12:52.149 --> 12:53.885
Moving at a quick clip of about

12:53.888 --> 12:55.976
25 feet due south.

12:55.979 --> 12:58.650
Positioned approximately
six inches above the ground.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.698
I'm guessing this is
when he was dragged.

13:03.987 --> 13:06.379
It's not too late to switch.
Are you sure you can drag...?!

13:06.381 --> 13:07.817
- Aah! Ow!
- Sorry.

13:13.823 --> 13:15.477
- Ow.
- Uh, stop right there.

13:21.788 --> 13:23.533
Oh, hey, look.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.299
Yeah, this would be from, uh,
Karl's key ring I saw on him.

13:26.302 --> 13:27.998
I think we're on the right
track, let's keep going.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.523
Okay, there's a lot of
chaotic movement right there.

13:30.526 --> 13:32.155
Ending with the phone horizontal.

13:32.158 --> 13:34.276
I'm guessing this is
when the killer hit Karl

13:34.278 --> 13:35.669
with something, killing him.

13:35.671 --> 13:37.963
If we can figure out the
angle of the head wound,

13:37.966 --> 13:40.021
it might help orient us
to where they came from.

13:40.023 --> 13:41.633
Can we borrow your flashlight again?

13:45.289 --> 13:47.378
- Ready?
- Come at me.

13:58.312 --> 13:59.486
Here, put me in a headlock.

13:59.489 --> 14:01.564
- What?
- I don't bite.

14:01.566 --> 14:02.955
I said, put me in a headlock.

14:15.469 --> 14:16.946
I need you two to focus.

14:16.949 --> 14:19.406
Now, where was the thief
before he killed Karl?

14:19.409 --> 14:21.322
There's more chaotic movement

14:21.325 --> 14:23.021
ten feet southwest...

14:23.024 --> 14:25.417
- ending with a sudden stop.
- Yeah.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.253
That worked. So at this point,

14:58.256 --> 15:00.865
Karl moved 17 feet southeast.

15:00.868 --> 15:01.833
I'm guessing this was

15:01.836 --> 15:04.273
the end of his approach to the killer.

15:07.872 --> 15:10.112
Okay, there's a lot
of movement over here.

Pretty slow.

16:43.206 --> 16:46.120
[EXHALES] Okay. So...

- until he got close enough...
- For the thief to attack.

16:59.831 --> 17:01.906
So, where I'm standing is where Karl

17:01.909 --> 17:03.038
surprised his killer.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.606
One of the nearby boxes

17:04.608 --> 17:06.391
must've been what the thief was after.

17:06.394 --> 17:07.656
Let's start checking.

17:15.892 --> 17:17.352
I got new nails. This is it.

17:17.355 --> 17:21.180
He must have used a pry
bar to pull the nails out

17:21.183 --> 17:23.763
and then replaced them with new
ones since he was done.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.539
A pry bar is a good weapon of opportunity.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.516
And it's consistent
with Karl's head wound.

17:27.519 --> 17:29.562
Okay, so we've found the thief's target.

17:29.565 --> 17:30.586
Whose box is that?

17:30.589 --> 17:32.154
It's one of North Korea's boxes.

17:32.157 --> 17:33.704
OVERSIGHT: If North
Korea finds out the vault

17:33.706 --> 17:35.836
was breached and one of
their boxes was targeted,

17:35.839 --> 17:38.297
it could cause an
international incident.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.117
Nils, how long before we
have to report the theft?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.598
The protocol is 12 hours.

17:42.601 --> 17:43.727
MATTY: Okay, Mac.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.274
That gives you 12 hours
to recover the stolen seeds

17:46.277 --> 17:47.680
and find Karl's killer.

17:47.683 --> 17:50.180
They log every seed that comes in here.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.759
you are not gonna believe this.

20:32.113 --> 20:35.549
I've got schematics, seed reports,

20:35.552 --> 20:37.206
drilling equipment.

20:38.577 --> 20:41.572
Whoever this guy is,
he's been here for months.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.133
Months? That's insane.

20:43.136 --> 20:44.555
Trust me, this looks insane.

20:44.558 --> 20:45.814
MACGYVER [OVER COMM]:
If this guy was willing

20:45.816 --> 20:46.969
to go to all this trouble,

20:46.972 --> 20:49.406
kill an innocent person, and
risk an international incident

20:49.409 --> 20:51.583
with North Korea over some seeds,

20:51.585 --> 20:53.602
there's no telling what he'll do next.

20:58.805 --> 21:01.598
MATTY [OVER COMM]: Mac, you got
anything on the seed thief yet?

21:01.601 --> 21:03.969
We're trying, there's just a lot here.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.553
This place is like a very
special episode of Hoarders.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.775
All this effort, months
of digging and planning

21:09.777 --> 21:12.386
and work just for a
rare form of a pea plant?

21:12.388 --> 21:14.258
Something's not adding up.

21:14.260 --> 21:15.435
Wait a second.

21:18.438 --> 21:20.481
Yeah, this is the chemical formula

21:20.483 --> 21:22.802
for a neurotoxic amino acid.

21:22.805 --> 21:24.181
It's a poison, Matty.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.864
RILEY: The pea plant
is a key ingredient?

21:25.867 --> 21:26.835
MACGYVER: Yes.

21:26.837 --> 21:28.748
This particular pea plant,
that can only be found

21:28.750 --> 21:30.857
in North Korea, is a
carrier for that toxin.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.059
And with the seeds, they can
grow as much as they want.

21:33.061 --> 21:34.626
Yes. And with the right equipment,

21:34.628 --> 21:37.701
they can then extract the
neurotoxin and synthesize it.

21:37.704 --> 21:39.139
Depending on the method of distribution,

21:39.141 --> 21:41.529
this poison has the
potential to kill millions.

21:41.532 --> 21:43.809
- You're saying they could weaponize it.
- Yeah.

21:43.811 --> 21:45.094
Explains why they went

21:45.097 --> 21:47.333
to all this trouble to break
into North Korea's seed stash.

21:47.335 --> 21:49.640
Okay, whoever we're
looking for just upgraded

21:49.643 --> 21:51.773
from murderer to possible terrorist.

21:51.775 --> 21:53.297
We need to figure out who this is

21:53.299 --> 21:55.734
and where they went with
that seed right now.

21:55.737 --> 21:57.591
RILEY: This cabin is in
the middle of nowhere,

21:57.594 --> 21:59.599
with no access to any wireless signal.

21:59.602 --> 22:02.659
How was our thief able to print out
this web page from two weeks ago?

22:11.229 --> 22:12.706
Line of sight.

22:12.709 --> 22:16.354
In remote rural areas, a
central satellite tower is built

22:16.357 --> 22:17.451
on a high point.

22:17.453 --> 22:18.800
So, if anyone wants service,

22:18.802 --> 22:21.325
each individual house has
to point a satellite dish

22:21.327 --> 22:23.542
directly at the main tower.

22:23.545 --> 22:26.222
All right, Mac, if you could
connect me to that tower,

22:26.225 --> 22:27.896
I could pull the data to
find out what our thief

22:27.898 --> 22:29.910
was looking up on the Internet
before he skipped town.

22:29.912 --> 22:31.898
So we should be looking
for a satellite dish.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.163
Right.

22:39.997 --> 22:41.129
Think I found it.

22:42.304 --> 22:43.956
It looks pretty fried.

22:43.958 --> 22:45.740
I'm guessing the last storm took it out.

22:45.742 --> 22:47.142
DESI: Can you get it working again?

22:47.144 --> 22:48.668
No.

22:51.356 --> 22:53.573
But we can build one.

22:53.576 --> 22:55.797
If you're ever in need,
a trusty metal bucket

22:55.800 --> 22:58.057
functions as a perfect satellite dish.

22:58.059 --> 22:59.450
Add a drill bit as the receiver,

22:59.452 --> 23:01.365
the copper wire as an Ethernet cable,

23:01.367 --> 23:02.757
and point it at the tower,

23:02.759 --> 23:04.179
and even in the middle of nowhere,

23:04.182 --> 23:06.239
you can connect to the world.

23:06.241 --> 23:07.588
Okay.

23:07.590 --> 23:10.374
Oh, read my mind.

23:10.376 --> 23:12.378
All right.

23:13.919 --> 23:15.572
All right.

23:17.426 --> 23:19.078
- How we doing?
- All right,

23:19.080 --> 23:20.503
hold it right there, Mac.

23:20.506 --> 23:22.134
Keep it steady. It's working.

23:22.137 --> 23:24.312
- Talk to me, Riley.
- His browser history

23:24.315 --> 23:26.065
only goes back about nine months.

23:26.068 --> 23:27.956
Uh, yeah, that's about how
long it would have taken

23:27.958 --> 23:30.132
to drill through the permafrost
from here to the vault.

23:30.134 --> 23:31.917
RILEY: Wait a minute, here's something.

23:31.919 --> 23:33.353
Our thief was sending a monthly payment

23:33.355 --> 23:34.922
to a flower shop in Brussels.

23:34.925 --> 23:35.964
DESI: Great, so now

23:35.966 --> 23:37.444
he has the seeds and a place with all

23:37.446 --> 23:39.143
the equipment necessary
to grow this plant.

23:39.146 --> 23:41.670
MATTY: Not if you get to
Brussels and stop him first.

23:42.799 --> 23:44.582
MACGYVER: Hey, Boze, just checking in,

23:44.584 --> 23:46.788
see how everything's going,
call me when you get a chance.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.094
Thanks.

[PHONE BEEPS]

23:50.416 --> 23:51.719
You're tense.

23:51.721 --> 23:52.938
What's up?

23:52.940 --> 23:55.593
[SIGHS] Well, we're tracking down a guy

23:55.595 --> 23:59.118
who broke into an international
seed vault, killed a man

23:59.120 --> 24:01.334
and is potentially
making a dangerous weapon.

24:01.337 --> 24:03.250
So I'm allowed to be tense, right?

24:03.253 --> 24:04.299
Nice cover.

24:05.538 --> 24:07.364
- What's really going on?
- Nothing.

24:07.367 --> 24:09.867
It's something with his dad.

24:09.870 --> 24:11.522
You know,

24:11.524 --> 24:14.089
I thought the only good thing
about Jack being gone was that

24:14.091 --> 24:15.569
maybe I could get some privacy.

24:15.571 --> 24:18.137
You were definitely mistaken about that.

24:18.139 --> 24:20.966
- Clearly.
- Oversight did seem distracted.

24:20.968 --> 24:22.271
You noticed, too?

24:22.273 --> 24:24.273
I don't know him as well as you do,

24:24.275 --> 24:26.275
I've only read your files, but...

24:26.277 --> 24:28.277
yeah, I could tell there
was something going on.

24:28.279 --> 24:30.497
- Any guesses as to what it might be?
- No.

24:30.499 --> 24:32.463
Oversight's my boss.

24:32.466 --> 24:35.286
It's not my business
to know what he does.

24:37.593 --> 24:39.203
But it is yours.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.378
Thank you.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.510
[COMPUTER BEEPING]

24:43.512 --> 24:44.859
Okay. I was able

24:44.861 --> 24:46.687
to find out what our
thief's monthly payment

24:46.689 --> 24:48.283
to the flower shop was for.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.908
They've got a standing
order for white lilies

24:50.911 --> 24:53.477
to be delivered to the
same address every month.

24:53.479 --> 24:56.871
Except, this month's order
was just picked up in person.

24:56.873 --> 24:59.308
- Yeah, that could be our guy.
- Agreed. This is our only lead.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.260
We need to track him
down. Where are the flowers

25:01.263 --> 25:02.705
usually delivered?

25:05.926 --> 25:08.448
MACGYVER: Yeah, I got
nothing on the north end.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.494
RILEY: I got nothing over
here on the east side.

25:10.496 --> 25:13.458
Just a bunch of, you know, cemetery.

25:13.461 --> 25:15.412
Keep your eyes open
for some white lilies.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.804
RILEY: Wait.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.982
I think I got some up here on the hill.

25:24.068 --> 25:25.461
These aren't fresh.

25:27.730 --> 25:29.817
Definitely not the ones picked up today.

Who are you?

25:35.869 --> 25:38.130

25:40.003 --> 25:42.380
My name's Oliver.

25:42.383 --> 25:44.119
I've just come to lay lilies down

25:44.122 --> 25:45.966

He's not our thief.

Background check confirms

26:00.435 --> 26:01.980
he is who he says he is.

He has white lilies at the address

He's connected to this somehow.

Please.

Uh, Jules, uh, was my sister's husband.

never thought he'd be capable

26:53.294 --> 26:54.794

That's awful. I'm so sorry.

27:27.042 --> 27:31.697
Jules withdrew after that.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.439
He picked up the oddest hobbies,

27:33.442 --> 27:36.036
uh, things he had no interest in before.

27:36.039 --> 27:38.866

27:40.513 --> 27:41.997
None of it made sense.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.393
And he started, uh, running
around with an awful crowd,

27:45.396 --> 27:50.921
he got himself mixed up
in some really bad stuff.

27:50.924 --> 27:54.839
The police even came
looking for him a few times.

27:54.842 --> 27:59.584
Until one day, he just left.

27:59.587 --> 28:02.541
Did he leave a note?
Any way to contact him?

28:02.544 --> 28:04.275
No.

No, he's been gone a
year now, maybe more.

- _

28:21.121 --> 28:22.416
A man has been killed,

28:22.419 --> 28:23.654
and something very,

28:23.657 --> 28:25.134
very dangerous has been stolen.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.419
We need to find Jules.

28:41.032 --> 28:43.728
MATTY: Well, everything
Oliver said seems to check out.

28:43.731 --> 28:47.214
Up until five years ago,
Jules Stevens was a librarian,

28:47.217 --> 28:49.573
involved in his community
and living a happy life

28:49.576 --> 28:51.097
with his wife and young daughter.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.846
Sounds like he went from
mild-mannered librarian

28:52.848 --> 28:54.282
to Thomas Crown-level criminal.

28:54.284 --> 28:57.386
After his family was killed,
Jules created an alias

28:57.389 --> 28:59.302
and was linked to a series of break-ins

28:59.305 --> 29:01.549
and increasingly
complicated bank heists,

29:01.552 --> 29:02.862
but he was never caught.

29:02.865 --> 29:04.988
MACGYVER: Still doesn't
explain why he was interested

29:04.991 --> 29:06.207
in making a poison

29:06.209 --> 29:08.209
from rare seeds he
got from a seed vault.

29:08.211 --> 29:11.430
Okay, guys, I was able to hack
the number that texted Oliver,

29:11.432 --> 29:14.227
and I found a bunch of messages
he sent to a blocked number.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.183
These messages line up with the
timing of the thefts he's linked to.

29:17.186 --> 29:18.574
He was trying to fence what he stole.

29:18.576 --> 29:19.964
Not from what I'm reading.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.924
According to these
messages, all he wanted

29:21.927 --> 29:25.102
was a face-to-face meeting
with a Ludek Passer.

29:25.105 --> 29:27.401
Well, this just went sideways.

29:27.411 --> 29:30.299
Ludek Passer is the
head of organized crime

29:30.302 --> 29:32.737
in Central Europe. He's a known recluse

29:32.740 --> 29:35.664
who refuses to meet with anyone
who isn't in his inner circle.

29:35.667 --> 29:38.144
It's part of how he's
stayed in power for so long.

29:38.147 --> 29:39.339
RILEY: Guys, I got bad news.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.816
Passer's agreed to a meeting.

29:40.819 --> 29:42.253
Today in Prague.

29:42.256 --> 29:44.526
Except this time, Jules
is bringing him a gift.

29:44.536 --> 29:47.011
The last thing we want
is an organized crime boss

29:47.014 --> 29:49.566
having his hands on
seeds that can synthesize

29:49.569 --> 29:50.839
into a powerful poison.

29:50.842 --> 29:52.613
Yeah, we're already behind.
We got to get to Prague

29:52.615 --> 29:54.722
and stop that meeting
before it's too late.

30:03.034 --> 30:04.787
LEANNA: We have been following Oversight

30:04.790 --> 30:06.615
all over town, and all we've learned

30:06.617 --> 30:08.612
is that he never uses his turn signal

30:08.615 --> 30:10.311
and his errands are even
more boring than mine.

30:10.313 --> 30:12.532
I don't know what you're talking
about. I found the dry cleaners

30:12.534 --> 30:14.057
to be scintillating.

for help, so I'm gonna help him.

Look, I know to you it's
just an egg salad sandwich,

30:34.602 --> 30:36.950
but to me, it could be the key
to figuring out what's going on.

waiting and watching

use a little caffeine.

Nah, man. I mean, Los Angeles
is known for being a small town.

Sooner or later we were
bound to run into each other.

31:04.632 --> 31:06.371

- Mm-hmm.

31:06.373 --> 31:08.425
For the record, typical tail procedure

31:08.428 --> 31:11.156
is eight lengths. When I

31:12.855 --> 31:15.555
not just one, so you can switch out.

You should always park with
your backs towards the target,

31:18.451 --> 31:22.320
watching them with your mirrors,
so they can't see your faces.

31:22.323 --> 31:23.953

MATTY [OVER COMM]:
Mac, I think I got something.

33:34.731 --> 33:37.227
A few months before
his family was killed,

33:37.230 --> 33:39.263
Jules was a key witness in a trial.

33:39.265 --> 33:40.612
RILEY: What does that
have to do with Passer?

33:40.614 --> 33:42.183
It was a robbery case.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.855
A thief that authorities in Europe

33:43.858 --> 33:45.727
have been hunting for a long time.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.417
He was tried and convicted,

33:47.420 --> 33:50.347
- and guess who the guy worked for.
- Passer.

33:50.350 --> 33:53.261
Jules gave the damaging
testimony that ultimately

33:53.264 --> 33:54.394
put the thief away.

33:54.397 --> 33:57.149
Jules got Passer's guy convicted, so...

33:57.152 --> 33:58.081
Passer had Jules

33:58.084 --> 33:59.563
and his family killed in retaliation,

33:59.565 --> 34:01.197
but made it look like a carjacking.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.792
Jules survived,

34:02.803 --> 34:05.159
but he knew who was really
behind the death of his family,

34:05.162 --> 34:06.857
so he became obsessed.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.261
Because of the trial, Jules
knew that there was an opening

34:09.264 --> 34:11.221
in Passer's organization, so he devoted

34:11.224 --> 34:13.714
himself to building a résumé

34:13.717 --> 34:15.717
