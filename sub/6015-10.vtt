00:02.237 --> 00:03.989
It seems the way they
design the car alarms...

00:05.477 --> 00:09.265
...is so that the car will behave as if it
was a nervous, hysterical person.

00:09.437 --> 00:13.430
Anyone goes near it,
anyone disturbs it, it's:

00:13.597 --> 00:16.430
Lights flashing on and off,
acting all crazy.

00:16.597 --> 00:19.191
Not everyone wants to draw
that much attention to themselves.

00:19.357 --> 00:21.951
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a car alarm that was more subtle?

00:22.117 --> 00:25.109
Maybe just, you know, somebody
tries to break in, and it goes:

00:30.397 --> 00:32.115
"Excuse me?"

00:32.557 --> 00:35.230
I would like a car alarm like that.

00:41.077 --> 00:42.590
Do you believe this?

00:42.757 --> 00:44.315
Car was parked right out front.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.230
- Was the alarm on?
- I don't know. I guess it was on.

00:47.397 --> 00:51.390
I don't know my alarm sound.
I'm not tuned into it like it's my son.

00:51.837 --> 00:54.556
I don't understand. How do
these thieves start the car?

00:54.717 --> 00:57.868
- They cross the wires or something.
- Cross the wires?

00:58.037 --> 01:00.187
I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

01:00.357 --> 01:02.552
- Hey.
- They stole my car.

01:02.717 --> 01:04.787
- Who did?
- They did.

01:04.956 --> 01:06.754
Was it more than just one?

01:06.917 --> 01:08.396
What should I do?
Call the police?

01:08.957 --> 01:11.107
What are they gonna do?

01:11.717 --> 01:15.266
You know, I'd better call the car-phone
company, cancel my service.

01:15.957 --> 01:17.948
Maybe you should
call your car phone.

01:18.117 --> 01:20.028
Yeah.

01:20.197 --> 01:22.313
He's probably driving it right now.

01:22.477 --> 01:25.355
Wait a minute. Call the car phone.
See what happens.

01:25.517 --> 01:27.235
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go ahead. Call.

01:27.397 --> 01:30.150
I don't even know if I
remember the number.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.432
What do I say if he picks up?

01:33.597 --> 01:35.349
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:35.517 --> 01:40.671
- Is this 555-8383?
- I have no idea.

01:40.837 --> 01:42.987
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.354
- Did you steal my car?
- Yes, I did.

01:48.277 --> 01:50.233
- You did?
- I did.

01:50.397 --> 01:54.072
- But that's my car.
- I didn't know it was yours.

01:54.237 --> 01:57.832
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know. Drive around.

01:57.997 --> 02:01.387
- Then can I have it back?
- No, I'm gonna k eep it.

02:01.557 --> 02:04.594
Let me talk to him.
Give it, give it, give it.

02:06.637 --> 02:08.514
- Hello.
- Yeah, who's this?

02:08.676 --> 02:10.110
- Kramer.
- Hello, Kramer.

02:10.276 --> 02:13.986
Listen, there's a pair of gloves
in the glove compartment.

02:14.157 --> 02:15.556
Wait, hold it.

02:17.277 --> 02:19.188
- Brown ones?
- Yeah.

02:19.357 --> 02:22.030
Could you mail those to me?
Or bring them by my building.

02:22.197 --> 02:25.428
- It's 129 West 81 st Street.
- 129... Okay.

02:25.597 --> 02:29.226
All right, thanks a lot.
Here's Jerry.

02:32.077 --> 02:33.510
Gloves.

02:33.677 --> 02:35.429
- Hello.
- Jerry.

02:36.237 --> 02:40.674
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.
How do you cross those wires?

02:40.837 --> 02:42.873
I didn't cross any wires.
The k eys were in it.

02:43.037 --> 02:47.872
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

02:48.277 --> 02:52.236
Hey, Jerry, when's the last time you
had a tune-up? Because I can't find...

02:52.397 --> 02:55.150
- Sid left the keys in the car.
- Who's Sid?

02:55.317 --> 02:57.512
Guy in the neighbourhood.
He parks cars on the block.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.872
- What do you mean?
- He moves them from side to side...

03:00.037 --> 03:02.426
...so you don't get a ticket.
- You pay him for that?

03:02.677 --> 03:05.475
- Yeah. Like 50 bucks a month.
- How many people does he do it for?

03:05.637 --> 03:09.073
- The whole block, 40, 50 cars.
- He only works three hours a day.

03:09.237 --> 03:13.150
He makes a fortune. He's been
doing that for years, right, Jerry?

03:13.637 --> 03:14.911
Could anybody do that?

03:15.077 --> 03:18.228
- Hey, Sid. What happened?
- I'm sorry, Jerry.

03:18.397 --> 03:19.989
Maybe I'm too old for this stuff.

03:20.157 --> 03:21.795
You left the keys in the car?

03:21.957 --> 03:24.471
Well, they're making that
Woody Allen movie on the block...

03:24.637 --> 03:27.390
...and all those people
and trucks everywhere...

03:27.557 --> 03:29.752
...and when I saw him,
I must've been distracted.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.987
- You know I'm in that movie.
- You're what?

03:32.157 --> 03:34.273
- Yeah, I'm an extra.
- How'd you get that?

03:34.437 --> 03:37.713
Well, I was just watching them film
yesterday, and some guy asked me.

03:37.877 --> 03:41.153
- Right out of the clear blue sky?
- Clear blue sky.

03:41.317 --> 03:44.275
- Why didn't they ask me?
- I got a quality.

03:44.437 --> 03:49.306
- Hey, Jerry, you got insurance, right?
- Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

03:49.477 --> 03:51.991
I'm going to visit my sister
in Virginia next Wednesday...

03:52.157 --> 03:53.909
...for a week, so I can't park it.

03:54.077 --> 03:55.715
- This Wednesday?
- No, next Wednesday.

03:55.877 --> 03:57.071
Week after this Wednesday.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.468
But the Wednesday two days
from now is the next Wednesday.

04:01.277 --> 04:03.791
If I meant this Wednesday,
I would've said this Wednesday.

04:03.957 --> 04:06.630
It's the week after this Wednesday.

04:08.517 --> 04:10.906
Sid, who's gonna move the cars
while you're away?

04:11.077 --> 04:13.545
Whoever wants to move them.
What do I care who moves them?

04:13.717 --> 04:15.309
They can move themselves
if they want.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.593
Maybe I could move them
until you get back.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.432
What's a young man like you want
to move cars for? You don't work?

04:21.596 --> 04:23.553
I'm in a transition phase right now.

04:23.837 --> 04:26.590
Well, if you want to move the cars,
move the cars.

04:26.757 --> 04:30.272
- Just don't forget to take the keys out.
- All right.

04:32.997 --> 04:36.672
Hello. Yeah, the defroster's
the one on the bottom.

04:36.837 --> 04:39.067
Just slide it all the way over.

04:39.957 --> 04:41.151
You're welcome.

04:41.317 --> 04:44.036
I'm in awe of his intellect.
When he talks, it sounds like...

04:44.197 --> 04:47.792
...he's reading from one of his novels.
- Owen March. I never heard of him.

04:48.117 --> 04:51.427
- Well, he's not a baseball player.
- Yeah, that's true.

04:51.597 --> 04:55.476
- It sounds like it's going pretty good.
- Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

04:55.637 --> 04:58.071
- What's that?
- He's 66 years old.

04:58.237 --> 05:00.671
Next, please.

05:00.837 --> 05:02.589
Go. Go. She...

05:02.757 --> 05:04.270
Go. Come on.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.916
Can I help you? Name, please.

05:06.077 --> 05:11.470
Seinfeld. I made a reservation
for a midsize, and she's a small.

05:12.477 --> 05:15.150
- I'm kidding around, of course.
- Yes.

05:15.317 --> 05:16.909
Okay, let's see here.

05:17.077 --> 05:21.275
- Sixty-six years old?
- Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.

05:21.437 --> 05:24.110
He works out. He's vibrant.
You'd really like him.

05:24.277 --> 05:28.190
Why do people always say that? I hate
everybody. Why would I like him?

05:28.357 --> 05:30.666
Could you go out
with a 66-year-old woman?

05:30.837 --> 05:34.716
Well, I'll tell you, she would
have to be really vibrant.

05:36.317 --> 05:38.626
So vibrant she'd be spinning.

05:40.117 --> 05:42.506
I'm sorry. We have no midsize
available at the moment.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.793
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

05:44.957 --> 05:47.710
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

05:48.197 --> 05:50.916
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

05:51.077 --> 05:53.193
That's why you have
the reservation.

05:53.357 --> 05:57.066
- I know why we have reservations.
- I don't think you do.

06:00.397 --> 06:03.070
If you did, I'd have a car.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.114
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.633
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

06:08.797 --> 06:13.552
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

06:13.717 --> 06:17.232
Anybody can just take them.

06:17.517 --> 06:20.190
Let me speak with my supervisor.

06:20.357 --> 06:22.712
Well, here we go.

06:22.877 --> 06:24.788
The supervisor.

06:24.957 --> 06:26.709
- Know what she's saying over there?
- What?

06:26.877 --> 06:29.755
"Hey, Marge, see those two people?
They think I'm talking to you.

06:29.917 --> 06:33.193
So you pretend like you're talking
to me. Okay, now you start talking."

06:33.357 --> 06:36.667
"You mean like this? So it looks like I'm
saying something, but I'm not."

06:36.837 --> 06:39.032
"Say something else,
and they won't yell at me...

06:39.197 --> 06:41.472
...because they thought
I was checking with you."

06:41.637 --> 06:44.026
"Okay, I think that's enough.
See you later."

06:44.197 --> 06:46.836
I'm sorry. My supervisor says
there's nothing we can do.

06:47.277 --> 06:50.110
Yeah, it looked like you were in
a real conversation over there.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.712
Well, we do have a compact
if you would like that.

06:52.877 --> 06:54.754
- Fine.
- All right.

06:54.917 --> 06:58.466
Well, we have a blue Ford Escort
for you, Mr. Seinfeld.

06:58.637 --> 07:01.105
- Would you like insurance?
- Yeah, give me the insurance...

07:01.277 --> 07:04.269
...because I am gonna beat
the hell out of this thing.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.590
Please fill this out.

07:11.157 --> 07:13.307
Do you think
I'm making a big mistake?

07:13.477 --> 07:15.866
If you enjoy being with him,
that's what's important.

07:16.037 --> 07:20.189
I love being with him.
I mean, I like being with him.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.996
It's okay being with him.

07:24.117 --> 07:27.234
- I just don't enjoy being with him.
- Well, that's what important.

07:27.397 --> 07:29.433
I'm meeting him for lunch
at Chadway's.

07:29.597 --> 07:32.907
Do I have to break up face to face,
or can I just do it over the phone?

07:33.077 --> 07:35.068
- How many times have you been out?
- Seven.

07:35.437 --> 07:37.109
Face to face.

07:37.277 --> 07:39.154
Seven dates is
a face-to-face breakup?

07:39.317 --> 07:42.195
If it was six, I could've let you go.

07:43.077 --> 07:46.274
But seven, I'm afraid,
is over the limit.

07:46.437 --> 07:49.429
Unless, of course, there was no sex.

07:54.237 --> 07:56.626
How's the pasta over there?

07:59.237 --> 08:00.875
What is going on out there?

08:01.037 --> 08:03.232
I need a bucket of water.
I got a car overheating.

08:03.397 --> 08:04.830
I got an alarm that won't go off.

08:04.997 --> 08:07.147
I'm pressing one.
I'm pressing two. Nothing.

08:07.317 --> 08:09.308
What do I do? Help me. Help me.

08:17.157 --> 08:18.909
They were supposed to do
my scene today.

08:19.077 --> 08:20.430
- Today?
- Yeah.

08:20.597 --> 08:24.146
They said they wanted me to walk down
the block carrying this bag of groceries.

08:24.317 --> 08:28.310
So I start to walk, and I trip.
And the grocery bag goes flying...

08:28.477 --> 08:31.514
...and Woody starts laughing.
- He was laughing?

08:31.677 --> 08:34.828
Oh, yeah. He was drinking something.
It started to come out of his nose.

08:34.996 --> 08:37.465
- So then what?
- Well, I got a line in the movie!

08:37.636 --> 08:39.832
- Get out!
- That's great.

08:41.996 --> 08:43.715
You got a line
in a Woody Allen movie?

08:44.197 --> 08:47.792
- Pretty good, huh?
- You're in the movie?

08:48.477 --> 08:51.389
- Is he in the scene?
- Yeah, it's me and him.

08:51.557 --> 08:53.434
I might have a new career
on my hands, huh?

08:53.597 --> 08:56.589
You mean "a career."

08:58.637 --> 09:01.151
- So was Mia Farrow there?
- I didn't see him.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.709
- What's your line?
- Well, okay, I'm there with Woody...

09:06.877 --> 09:10.267
...you know. I'm at this bar,
and, you know, it's Woody Allen.

09:10.437 --> 09:12.746
- Did I mention that?
- We got it. We got it.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.909
And I'm sitting there with Woody,
and I turn to him and I go:

09:16.077 --> 09:19.228
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

09:20.837 --> 09:25.115
- Is that how you're gonna say it?
- No, no. I'm working on it.

09:25.757 --> 09:27.110
Do it like this.

09:27.277 --> 09:30.906
- These pretzels are making me thirsty.
- No.

09:31.077 --> 09:36.071
- These pretzels are making me thirsty.
- No, no. See, that's no good.

09:36.237 --> 09:38.432
You don't know how to act.

09:38.597 --> 09:40.553
These pretzels...

09:41.477 --> 09:43.195
...are making me thirsty!

09:46.757 --> 09:49.954
- That was no good?
- I didn't say anything.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.426
All right, I'm gonna go
break up with Owen.

09:52.597 --> 09:56.510
What was wrong with that?
I had a different interpretation.

09:56.677 --> 09:58.793
Do you know anything
about this pretzel guy?

09:58.957 --> 10:00.788
Maybe he's been in the bar
a long time...

10:00.957 --> 10:03.869
...and he's really depressed because
he has no job, and no woman...

10:04.037 --> 10:05.789
...and he's parking cars for a living!

10:05.957 --> 10:09.267
All right! All right!
Shut up! Shut up!

10:09.437 --> 10:14.591
I hear you! I'm coming down!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!

10:15.877 --> 10:17.595
Yeah!

10:22.957 --> 10:24.310
Oh, my God.

10:25.397 --> 10:26.989
Call an ambulance.

10:27.157 --> 10:29.466
Boy, he took it hard.

10:31.717 --> 10:33.469
We were walking down the block...

10:33.637 --> 10:36.435
...I was about to break up with him,
then he started to twitch.

10:36.597 --> 10:40.033
Yes, I need an ambulance at 129
West 81 st Street, Apartment 5A.

10:40.197 --> 10:42.267
- Tell them to hurry. Hurry!
- It's an ambulance.

10:44.597 --> 10:47.191
I don't know, but he's unconscious.

10:47.557 --> 10:50.196
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

10:52.197 --> 10:54.074
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.068
- Kramer.
- What happened here?

10:56.237 --> 10:58.705
I don't know. What should we do?
We called an ambulance.

10:58.877 --> 11:01.471
- Anyone know first aid?
- Do something with the extremities.

11:01.637 --> 11:03.389
- What extremities?
- What's an extremity?

11:03.557 --> 11:05.388
You raise the feet,
get blood to the head.

11:05.557 --> 11:07.468
You raise the head,
get blood to the feet.

11:07.637 --> 11:10.105
Okay, what about a cold compress?
They always do that.

11:10.277 --> 11:11.915
- I don't have a washcloth.
- Use a paper towel.

11:12.077 --> 11:14.716
- You can't put that on his head.
- What about a big sponge?

11:14.877 --> 11:16.788
- How you gonna hold it on there?
- Use a belt.

11:16.957 --> 11:20.347
No, no, no. That'll...
It'll drip all over him.

11:20.517 --> 11:22.712
- Should we walk him around?
- I've seen them do that.

11:22.877 --> 11:25.311
- That's for a drug overdose.
- Maybe that's what he's got.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.991
No, I just had lunch with him.
He didn't leave the table.

11:28.157 --> 11:30.876
Well, he could've dropped acid
when you weren't looking.

11:31.877 --> 11:33.708
He is not a drug addict.

11:33.877 --> 11:36.630
Maybe he's diabetic. He might
just need a cookie or something.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.106
- A cookie!
- Can you give him a cookie?

11:39.277 --> 11:42.349
- How's he gonna chew it?
- Move his teeth. Worked for my uncle.

11:42.517 --> 11:45.111
The sugar revived him.

11:47.357 --> 11:49.473
Careful, you're getting crumbs
all over him.

11:49.797 --> 11:52.516
I've got him chewing, but I don't
think he's gonna swallow.

11:52.677 --> 11:55.669
Let's put a few cookies in a
blender and he could drink it.

11:55.837 --> 11:58.431
- Cookies don't liquefy.
- They do. You can liquefy a cookie.

11:58.597 --> 12:00.986
- I'll get the blender.
- I don't have a blender.

12:01.157 --> 12:03.591
- You've got a blender.
- I'd know if I had a blender.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.430
Where is the ambulance?!

12:13.597 --> 12:16.509
Hello, yes. I called for an ambulance
like 35 minutes ago.

12:16.677 --> 12:18.554
I can't believe
what's going on out here.

12:18.717 --> 12:21.709
This is an emergency.
What's taking so long?

12:21.957 --> 12:23.788
Wait a second.
Maybe that's them.

12:23.957 --> 12:25.231
- Hello.
- Paramedics.

12:25.397 --> 12:28.036
Come on up. Okay, they're here.

12:30.397 --> 12:32.706
He seems to be breathing.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.795
You know, I've got to tell you,
he's a pretty good-looking guy.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.151
I know.

12:39.317 --> 12:41.911
Those eyebrows could use a trimming.
You ever mention that?

12:42.077 --> 12:43.829
Almost.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.431
I mean, because, come on,
they're running wild there.

12:47.037 --> 12:49.790
- It's not an easy thing to bring up.
- Yeah, that's true.

12:49.957 --> 12:52.107
You should see his bathrobe, man.
It's all silk.

12:52.277 --> 12:54.950
Yeah. Does he wear slippers.
I bet he wears slippers.

12:55.117 --> 12:58.427
- He does. How'd you know that?
- I could tell.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.915
What happened?
What took you so long?

13:02.077 --> 13:04.113
We got here 20 minutes ago,
but we couldn't move.

13:04.277 --> 13:07.075
The intersection is gridlocked.
I've never seen anything like it.

13:07.237 --> 13:10.593
Finally we make the turn, and this guy
who was triple-parking cars...

13:10.757 --> 13:14.272
...slammed into us with a blue Escort.
- Blue Escort?

13:14.437 --> 13:16.667
- That's my rent-a-car!
- Oh, man.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.952
What happened to the car?

13:18.117 --> 13:21.348
I'm sorry. You don't know
what's going on out there!

13:21.517 --> 13:22.506
Who's he?

13:22.677 --> 13:24.235
- This guy I'm seeing.
- What happened?

13:24.397 --> 13:28.185
- We don't know.
- Who put cookies in his mouth?

13:28.357 --> 13:31.235
- Cookies?
- You're not supposed to do that.

13:31.397 --> 13:34.036
- So how'd you hit the car?
- I was moving it across the street.

13:34.197 --> 13:37.109
I looked up and I saw Woody Allen.
I got all distracted.

13:37.277 --> 13:40.713
- It's not even my car. It's a rental.
- What are you doing out there?

13:40.877 --> 13:42.993
You're holding up the production
of the movie.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.273
We can't shoot, and Woody,
he's really mad at you.

13:45.437 --> 13:47.712
Woody mentioned me?
What did he say?

13:47.877 --> 13:51.347
He said, "Who's the moron who's got
the street all screwed up?"

13:51.797 --> 13:53.435
Should I apologize to Woody?

13:54.717 --> 13:56.116
All right, I'll tell you what.

13:56.277 --> 13:59.428
Next time I talk to him,
maybe I'll bring it up.

13:59.877 --> 14:01.868
I'll feel him out.

14:02.437 --> 14:06.112
What do you think first aid was like
hundreds of years ago?

14:06.277 --> 14:08.108
I mean, they had no medicine,
no drugs...

14:08.277 --> 14:11.826
...no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first.

14:11.997 --> 14:14.795
That was it. That was the whole
first aid. They sit with you.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.948
That's all they could do.
"Can you help me?"

14:17.117 --> 14:20.154
"No, we can't help you,
but we were the first ones here.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.468
Did you see our truck?
'First aid.' That's our motto.

14:23.637 --> 14:25.195
We show up before anybody."

14:25.357 --> 14:27.234
You didn't say you didn't
know how to drive.

14:27.397 --> 14:30.389
- Should've mentioned that.
- Well, I know how to drive.

14:30.557 --> 14:32.354
Then how did all those cars
get damaged?

14:32.517 --> 14:35.793
Why are people calling me up,
screaming on the phone?

14:35.957 --> 14:38.755
- Most of them cancelled out on me.
- Can I get anybody anything?

14:38.917 --> 14:40.794
Moving cars from one side
to the other...

14:40.957 --> 14:44.029
...don't take no more sense
than putting on a pair of pants.

14:44.197 --> 14:48.156
My question to you is:
Who's putting your pants on?

14:48.397 --> 14:51.355
- I put my pants on, Sid.
- I don't believe you.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.587
You can put your pants on,
you can move cars.

14:53.757 --> 14:56.669
I don't want to get into a big
dispute about the pants.

14:56.837 --> 14:58.953
Who's gonna send money to my
sister in Virginia?

14:59.117 --> 15:00.914
Her little boy
needs surgery on his foot.

15:01.277 --> 15:05.555
He'll be walking around with a limp,
because you can't park a few cars.

15:05.957 --> 15:07.470
Maybe I could call my father.

15:08.517 --> 15:12.430
- Hey, you seen the paper yet?
- Interestingly enough, no...

15:12.597 --> 15:15.509
...inasmuch as it is my paper.

15:15.677 --> 15:17.156
There's an article on that writer.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.707
"Owen March, prominent author and
essayist, suffered a stroke yesterday...

15:20.877 --> 15:23.391
...in the Upper West Side
apartment of a friend."

15:23.557 --> 15:25.946
That's the guy that was here.
You're the friend.

15:26.277 --> 15:30.509
Thanks. "The extent of the damage
would've been far less severe...

15:30.677 --> 15:33.635
...had paramedics been able
to reach him sooner."

15:34.997 --> 15:37.557
- Oh, Lord.
- "The commotion also delayed...

15:37.717 --> 15:40.834
...production of a Woody Allen movie
that was shooting up the block.

15:41.277 --> 15:43.427
A spokeswoman
for the legendary filmmaker...

15:43.597 --> 15:45.952
...said that Mr. Allen
was extremely agitated...

15:46.117 --> 15:50.588
...and wondered if his days of shooting
movies in New York were over."

15:50.797 --> 15:52.116
Five seconds.

15:52.277 --> 15:55.872
Jerry, I was five seconds away
from breaking up with him.

15:56.037 --> 16:00.588
Five seconds! The next words out
of my mouth were, "Owen, it's over."

16:00.757 --> 16:04.113
- Can he communicate?
- Yeah. Well, he nods.

16:04.277 --> 16:05.869
And I think he understands me.

16:06.037 --> 16:08.107
He seems to enjoy it
when I read to him.

16:09.757 --> 16:11.873
All right, she's free.

16:14.157 --> 16:16.512
Hi, I called before.
My car got smashed.

16:16.677 --> 16:19.350
So listen. What should I do?
If I break up with him now...

16:19.517 --> 16:23.715
...it'll look like I'm abandoning him.
I'll be ostracized from the community.

16:23.877 --> 16:25.947
What community?
There's a community?

16:26.117 --> 16:27.436
Of course there's a community.

16:27.597 --> 16:30.236
All these years, I'm living in
a community, I had no idea.

16:30.397 --> 16:35.073
Sir, the estimate on the damage
to your car is $2866.

16:35.237 --> 16:38.229
- I got the insurance and everything...
- Yes, now, in your report...

16:38.397 --> 16:41.070
...you said you weren't the driver
at the time of the accident.

16:41.237 --> 16:42.829
Somebody else was driving it.

16:42.997 --> 16:46.910
All right, well, sir, you're only covered
for when you're driving the car.

16:47.077 --> 16:49.307
What's that?

16:49.477 --> 16:52.833
- You're not covered for other drivers.
- Other drivers?

16:52.997 --> 16:55.875
Your whole business is based
on other drivers. It's a rented car.

16:56.037 --> 16:58.346
That's who's driving it.
Other drivers.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.348
Doesn't my credit card cover me?

17:00.517 --> 17:03.031
- Not that particular one.
- I got a hundred cards.

17:03.197 --> 17:05.790
Here, here. Pick a card.
Take any card you want.

17:05.957 --> 17:07.549
Go ahead. Whichever one.
I don't care.

17:07.717 --> 17:11.675
- lf you had read the rental agreement...
- Did you see the size of that document?

17:11.837 --> 17:14.476
It's like the Declaration of
Independence. Who's gonna read that?

17:14.637 --> 17:18.185
Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now,
you are not covered for that damage...

17:18.357 --> 17:22.669
...and there is absolutely nothing
that can be done about that.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.708
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

17:34.237 --> 17:36.546
It's good, isn't it?

17:37.117 --> 17:39.153
Yankee bean.

17:39.957 --> 17:42.312
Why Yankee bean, huh?

17:42.477 --> 17:45.594
Don't they have beans
in the South?

17:45.757 --> 17:48.794
I mean, if you order Yankee bean
in the South, are they offended?

17:52.277 --> 17:55.667
Yank ee bean. Yank ee bean.

17:56.277 --> 18:02.193
I lik e my Yank ee bean.

18:10.797 --> 18:12.355
Owen...

18:17.477 --> 18:20.071
...I think we have to talk.

18:20.237 --> 18:23.229
I mean, I have to talk.

18:23.557 --> 18:28.677
It would be nice if we could,
but, you know, whatever.

18:31.397 --> 18:36.073
Don't get me wrong.
I like coming here and feeding you...

18:36.237 --> 18:39.707
...and cleaning a little,
and paying your bills.

18:39.877 --> 18:43.108
I mean, that's good stuff.
Good stuff.

18:45.157 --> 18:49.594
I have a wonderful time when
I'm with you. Wonderful!

18:50.597 --> 18:53.873
But at this point in my life,
I'm not really sure...

18:54.037 --> 18:58.553
...that I'm ready to make
a commitment to one person.

18:58.717 --> 19:01.914
I'm just not really sure that we
have enough in common.

19:02.077 --> 19:04.716
I mean, for example:

19:04.877 --> 19:08.028
I like running in the park...

19:08.197 --> 19:09.630
...bicycling...

19:09.797 --> 19:14.348
...roller-skating,
tennis and skiing...

19:14.517 --> 19:16.826
And, well...

19:16.997 --> 19:20.034
I'm gonna be brutally honest
with you now.

19:20.317 --> 19:23.992
It's a bitch to get here.
It's two subways.

19:24.157 --> 19:27.229
I have to transfer at 42nd Street
to take the double-R.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.546
Anyway, I mean, this doesn't
mean we can't be friends.

19:34.877 --> 19:37.789
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

19:43.237 --> 19:45.307
Can you die from an odour?

19:46.037 --> 19:49.029
I mean, if you were locked in
a vomitorium for two weeks...

19:49.197 --> 19:53.315
...could you die from the odour?
- An overdose of odour. Good question.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.952
Do I smell?

19:57.117 --> 20:00.507
No, no, no. I was just down
at the 42nd Street subway today.

20:00.677 --> 20:03.032
It is disgusting.

20:03.197 --> 20:05.950
Guess who I bumped into? Owen.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.995
- He's all right?
- Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.

20:09.157 --> 20:11.876
Told me he
was just using me for sex.

20:14.117 --> 20:15.345
- Let me get that.
- I got it.

20:15.517 --> 20:17.792
- Please.
- Let me. I smashed your car.

20:17.957 --> 20:19.515
It cost you over $2000.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.589
Yeah, a cup of coffee
should cover it.

20:24.037 --> 20:27.154
- Oh, man.
- What are you doing here?

20:27.317 --> 20:28.511
I got fired from the movie.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.269
- Get out of here. What?
- What?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.951
Well, you know, they were
going to shoot it today.

20:33.117 --> 20:36.427
We rehearsed it twice,
and then Woody yells, "Action."

20:36.597 --> 20:37.950
I turn to him and I say:

20:38.117 --> 20:40.028
"These pretzels are making
me thirsty."

20:40.197 --> 20:42.472
- Right.
- Then I took a swig of beer...

20:42.637 --> 20:46.266
...and I slammed the glass down
on the bar, and it shattered.

20:47.677 --> 20:51.465
Well, one of the pieces
must've hit Woody...

20:52.117 --> 20:54.233
...and he started crying.

20:54.397 --> 20:57.514
And he yells out, "I'm bleeding,"
and he runs off.

20:57.677 --> 21:01.829
Anyway, this woman, she came up
to me, and she says, "You're fired."

21:02.277 --> 21:04.268
Boy, I really nailed that scene.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.990
Oh, wait a...

21:12.037 --> 21:15.188
Oh, for crying out loud.

21:23.677 --> 21:26.066
The best part of a relationship
is when you're sick.

21:26.397 --> 21:28.991
The best part of being sick
is when you're in a relationship.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.068
But if I got married,
you know those vows...

21:31.237 --> 21:33.467
...for richer or for poorer,
for better or for worse.

21:33.637 --> 21:36.356
All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.

21:36.517 --> 21:40.510
"Do you take this man in sickness?"

21:40.677 --> 21:42.269
That's the time
I need somebody there.

21:42.437 --> 21:44.473
The rest of the time,
go out, have a ball.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.595
But if I get the sniffles,
you better be there.

22:00.437 --> 22:02.428
