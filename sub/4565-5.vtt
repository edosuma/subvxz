00:05.505 --> 00:08.273
Eyes, look your last.

00:08.275 --> 00:12.311
Arms, take your
last embrace.

00:16.282 --> 00:21.286
And, lips, oh,
you the doors of breath,

00:21.288 --> 00:23.355
Seal with a righteous kiss.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.591
Back off!

00:25.593 --> 00:27.893
What meanest thou?

00:27.895 --> 00:30.362
Spear carrier...

00:31.664 --> 00:32.965
Who havest no lines.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.701
You tried to kiss
my woman.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.936
This I cannot allow.
Prepare to die!

00:37.938 --> 00:39.638
Lucas:
<i>Farkle,</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:41.206
What are you doing?

00:41.208 --> 00:45.244
Well, now it's
"romeo and juliet
and farkle."

00:45.246 --> 00:46.845
I play farkle.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.381
Dude, I'm supposed
to kiss the girl.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.416
Shakespeare said.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.251
Who thinks the spear carrier

00:52.253 --> 00:53.485
Should finally get
to kiss juliet?

00:53.487 --> 00:54.953
( cheering )

00:54.955 --> 00:58.791
Yeah, you kiss that girl,
you crazy spear carrier.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.360
Hark!
You cometh uppeth here

01:01.362 --> 01:02.594
And getteth kissed too.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.963
( all cheering )

01:04.965 --> 01:06.732
Thank you, thank you.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.467
You're too kind, seriously.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.839
How you doing?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.607
I just don't understand

01:15.609 --> 01:17.743
How we end up
in situations like this.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.913
( applause )

01:34.961 --> 01:36.328

01:39.300 --> 01:41.800
Thank you.
Thank you, farkle nation!

01:43.736 --> 01:45.270
Farkle, come here.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.773
Maya, don't.
He thinks he was good.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.007
Yeah, I'm gonna fix that.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.909
But you can't
tell him the truth.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.779
- You'll crush him.
- Oh, I can tell him the truth.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.914
It's you who can't
tell him the truth
because you're afraid.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.050
I'm not afraid.
I'm nice.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.685
You're saying I'm not nice?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.653
No, I'm afraid to say that.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.856
Tell him the truth.
You know farkle.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.557
You know what
will happen if you don't.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.060
Farkle.

02:09.996 --> 02:13.599
You were so--
what are the best words?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.801
He killed the play.
Those are the words.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.970
Those are the only words.
You killed the play.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.404
Tell him.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.473
What?  What does she mean?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.542
She means you
killed it, farkle.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.577
Killed it!
Showbiz talk.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.045
I actually I thought
I ruined the play.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.313
If you would've told me
I ruined the play,

02:28.315 --> 02:31.984
I would have been crushed,
but I would've believed you.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.386
( sighs )
how could I crush

02:34.388 --> 02:35.754
One of the best actors

02:35.756 --> 02:38.557
Working in middle school
today?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.993
I'm a good actor?
What if I'm better than good?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.794
What if I'm great?
What if I'm the greatest actor

02:42.796 --> 02:46.732
That would be sad.  Wah.
It's okay, it's okay.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.066
I was acting.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.636
Thanks, riley,
my public awaits.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.738
Hello, everybody!

02:52.740 --> 02:54.406
You can't lie to him,
riley.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.807
You're gonna break
our little farkle.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.010
Oh, I will not.
I didn't do anything.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.112
This will all go away.

the truth of what happened

04:14.788 --> 04:17.089
We spend some time
finding out what truth is.

Where'd you  <i>get</i>
<i>the nice locket?</i>

04:19.526 --> 04:22.861
Shh, I come here
to learn.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.130
( both laugh )

04:25.132 --> 04:26.965
All through history,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.034
People have suffered
consequences

04:29.036 --> 04:30.602
For telling the truth.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.971
- Is that real gold?
- Don't know.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.072
Doesn't matter.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.108
They all suffered dearly

04:36.110 --> 04:37.976
For having the courage

04:37.978 --> 04:39.111
To tell the truth.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.647
So sometimes
it's better not to?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.982
But aren't
there consequences
for that too, sir?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.651
Yes, there are, mr. Friar.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.086
But in my experience
with the universe,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.788
No matter what you do,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.491
The truth
always finds a way
of coming out.

<i>( bell rings )</i>

04:55.495 --> 04:56.728
( students chatter )

04:58.031 --> 05:00.999
So... Where'd you
get the locket?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.567
- France.
- You were in France?

05:02.569 --> 05:04.002
<i>Si, senor.</i>

05:04.004 --> 05:06.004
You didn't go to France

05:06.006 --> 05:08.907
You would have
brought me back
a croissant.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.742
- Bing.
- Ooh.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.744
Piping hot.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.048
Wait a minute.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.549
Where did you
really get this?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.950
I found it on the street.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.118
Bleah!

05:20.987 --> 05:23.522
Come on,
where'd you get the locket?

05:23.524 --> 05:24.756
My father sent it to me.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.957
- He did?
- You don't believe me?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.993
- Did you just tell me?
- I just told you.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.828
- Then I believe you.
- So this is over?

05:29.830 --> 05:34.166
I do, however,
have one question
for the locket.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.568
Where'd you get the maya?!

05:36.570 --> 05:38.503
You don't believe
my father sent this to me?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.038
Why don't you
just tell me?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.773
Why don't you just
call me a liar?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.108
Why don't you just
tell me the truth?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.142
Oh, you think
that's important?

05:44.144 --> 05:46.645
Did you think farkle
was good in the play?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.213
( melodramatic gasp )

05:53.720 --> 05:55.520
I want to skip ahead
in your truth lesson.

05:56.723 --> 05:57.956
Is it okay to tell
a little white lie

05:57.958 --> 06:00.192
- To spare
somebody's feelings?
- No.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.595
My feelings?

06:05.131 --> 06:07.566
- No.
- Then always truth.

06:10.002 --> 06:14.005
Well, what do we have here?

06:14.007 --> 06:16.675
- Chicken.
- I'll tell you
right now, topanga,

06:16.677 --> 06:17.909
This was never a chicken.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.546
Why don't you
just eat it, honey.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.116
I'm looking forward to hearing
what you think of it after.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.987
Oh, great teller of the truth,

06:28.989 --> 06:32.090
How you're going
to get out of this one.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.793
( cracking )

06:37.263 --> 06:39.564
Psst, what'd you get?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.700
S'ghetti and meatballs.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.235
Ooh, yum.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.871
Yum that!

06:46.973 --> 06:48.874
Why this me?!
Why yum him?!

06:50.977 --> 06:53.111
All right, fine,
I'll eat it.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.780
Here we go.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.983
Have we prayed?
Have we prayed

06:57.985 --> 06:59.751
As a family?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.219
We haven't done
that in a while.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.156
Go ahead, pray.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.893
Oh, I'll pray.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.597
The world
is a beautiful place...

07:13.866 --> 07:15.367
Full of many beautiful things.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.203
Look what she did
to your chicken!

07:20.973 --> 07:22.674
Eat your dinner, honey.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.142
Okay.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.744
I'll see you soon.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.182
( sighs, laughs )

07:34.086 --> 07:36.721
Well, what do you think?

07:36.723 --> 07:39.724
Um, you know,
from eating this chicken,

07:39.726 --> 07:41.860
I'll tell you right now
how this chicken died.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.195
It ate this chicken.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.200
You know, daddy,
sometimes when I don't
want to eat something,

07:48.202 --> 07:50.769
Mommy feeds it to me
like it was an airplane.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.071
( mimics motor whir )

07:53.073 --> 07:54.840
And I like that.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.409
That's very sweet, auggie,

07:57.411 --> 07:59.110
But daddy's
a little too old

07:59.112 --> 08:00.745
For mommy to feed him.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.013
( chuckles )

08:02.949 --> 08:05.250
( mimics motor whirring )

08:10.022 --> 08:12.924
There's a serious pigeon
following me.

08:12.926 --> 08:17.062
Hey, here's a new thing.
Where'd you get the locket?

08:17.064 --> 08:20.699
He's a very sneaky pigeon,
but I'm onto him.

08:20.701 --> 08:24.002
Because it's gold,
it's expensive,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.771
And my curiosity
gets the better of me.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.274
So I ducked behind the tree
to fake out the pigeon.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.675
And you know
who came over?

08:30.677 --> 08:31.776
A squirrel.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.881
Because I was already
in my thing with the pigeon.

08:36.949 --> 08:39.417
I need to know
if you're stealing things.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.219
You don't think
my dad sends me stuff?

08:41.221 --> 08:43.021
Maya, you've cried to me

08:43.023 --> 08:45.323
Because your dad
doesn't send you stuff.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.993
Sometimes I walk
around the village

08:47.995 --> 08:50.695
And I pass stores
and I look in windows

08:50.697 --> 08:52.297
At things I know
I'll never have.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.099
So one day, I saw this

08:54.101 --> 08:56.167
Sitting in
a lost-and-found basket.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.335
Do you think it's right
that somebody

08:57.337 --> 08:58.937
Loses something
so beautiful

08:58.939 --> 09:02.541
Who knows?  I don't
have a criminal mind.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.277
I don't think
like you people.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.045
I walked by the window
for months.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.747
Nobody claimed
the locket, okay?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.882
It sat there like
a kid that has no--

09:10.884 --> 09:12.717
Like an orphan.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.020
So I claimed it.
It's mine now.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.821
It's not.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.457
You took something that
doesn't belong to you.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.192
How come you don't
tell farkle the truth,

09:21.194 --> 09:22.460
But you have no trouble
telling me?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.830
( warbles )

09:25.832 --> 09:27.265
And you stop judging me.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.437
Hey, my father tells
my mother the truth,

09:32.439 --> 09:33.838
Even when he knows

09:33.840 --> 09:36.274
She's gonna shove
a chicken in his face.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.843
- Sorry I missed it.
- Yep, I was thinking about you.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.378
- Thanks.
- 'cause I love you.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.181
Then why do you want
to end up in the slammer?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.150
Here we go.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.152
You won't do well
in the slammer.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.887
I will so.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.057
You won't pack right.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.825
And you'll forget
to bring shower shoes

09:53.827 --> 09:55.126
And you'll take
somebody else's

09:55.128 --> 09:56.394
From the lost-and-found.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.163
And I think...

09:58.165 --> 10:00.432
You're gonna get
toe fungus!

10:00.434 --> 10:02.934
And I think you deserve
to get toe fungus

10:02.936 --> 10:05.136
Because they're
not your shower shoes.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.072
( cries )
they're not!

10:07.074 --> 10:08.873
That's adorable.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.942
I think you're a thief.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.278
That's not.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.347
You think I'm afraid
to tell people the truth?

10:15.349 --> 10:18.183
I'm not,
and I now await
your praise.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.089
Maya?

10:38.437 --> 10:40.138
I got something
to say to you.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.539
♪ I can't hear you

10:41.541 --> 10:43.908
♪ baddada dadaa dadaa...

10:43.910 --> 10:45.143
I'm talking to you.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.046
( singing nonsense words )

10:50.349 --> 10:52.283
( singing continues )

10:52.285 --> 10:54.285

♪ and...

11:00.594 --> 11:02.594
Go.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.562

you're a thief,

11:04.564 --> 11:05.964
Or not a thief,

11:05.966 --> 11:08.867
Or you stole the locket
or you didn't,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.902
It doesn't belong to you.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.170
It belongs to somebody else.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.139
<i>And you have to tell</i>
<i>the truth about it</i>

11:14.141 --> 11:16.207
Because you
are upsetting the universe.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.077
And the universe is going
to have the truth
come out anyway.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.317
When are you gonna
tell the truth to farkle?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.453
I hardly think the universe
is upset with me

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
For being nice to farkle.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.390
I mean, what could
possibly go wrong there?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.591
Hey, chess club,

11:33.593 --> 11:35.160
You can move king's knight
to bishop six

11:35.162 --> 11:36.227
And then you can eat it!

11:36.229 --> 11:37.629
'cause I quit the chess club

11:37.631 --> 11:40.198
'cause I'm an actor,
'cause riley said so.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.400
'cause riley said so.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.235
Hey, chemistry club,
you know what you get

11:44.237 --> 11:45.570
When you put sodium
and chlorine together?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.638
You're a bunch
of losers!

11:48.107 --> 11:49.441
- Farkle!
- Riley.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.509
You changed my life.
The farkle you knew
is gone.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.111

♪ whata whata

12:20.272 --> 12:23.208
I'm looking at this book.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.077
It's a cookbook
about chickens.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.147
You want to do this?

12:29.149 --> 12:31.082
I do.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.150
Kiss kiss?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.618
Nope nope.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.086
Want to see
where this goes.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.288
Me too.  So...

12:37.290 --> 12:40.291
Topanga, look at
all these recipes

12:40.293 --> 12:43.294
About chicken
with pictures.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.230
Fried chicken,
barbecued chicken...

12:45.232 --> 12:47.132
- Uh-huh, right, got it.
- Orange chicken,
chicken a la king.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.167
- Sure, right.
- Chicken marsala,
teriyaki chicken.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.170
- Great, sure.
- General tso's chicken,
chicken tikka masala!

12:53.672 --> 12:55.573
- Your point?
- Well...

12:55.575 --> 12:57.408
Topanga, I think
you must admit

12:57.410 --> 12:59.711
I have been very careful
to span the gamut

12:59.713 --> 13:02.280
Of many international
chicken selections.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.184
If you stop right now,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.419
Nothing bad
will happen to you.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.191
- Braised chicken...
- Uh-huh.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.528
- Right, sure.
- Chicken cordon bleu,
chicken pot pie.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.429
Auggie, you've been
watching us, right?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.199
Your thoughts
on the subject?

13:26.605 --> 13:27.739
Good luck.

13:36.048 --> 13:40.418
Look, honey, it's auggie's
big book of dinosaurs.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.620
Look at that.  Wow.

13:42.622 --> 13:46.090
Look, and right here
on page...

13:46.092 --> 13:48.693
Nine is your chicken.

13:52.097 --> 13:54.199
It's a pterodactyl.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.736
Now it says here
it died out

13:58.738 --> 14:01.439
Over 65 million years ago.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.374
That might explain
why your chicken

14:03.376 --> 14:05.210
Was a little dry.

14:10.749 --> 14:12.250
Oh.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.518
This is nice.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.421
Oh, are we taking
a walkie?

14:16.423 --> 14:18.122
Yeah, we're taking
a walkie.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.725
You see, honey,
my truth is that

14:20.727 --> 14:23.127
From the moment I met you...

14:23.129 --> 14:25.163
I adored you.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.232
And there is nothing
you could do

14:27.234 --> 14:30.535
Or say
that could ever
change that.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.337
You're locking me
out of the house now,
aren't you?

14:32.339 --> 14:34.706
( excitedly )
that's right!  That's exactly
what I'm gonna do!

14:38.744 --> 14:40.645
-  <i>( knocks on window )</i>
<i>- maya?</i>

14:40.647 --> 14:42.580
Nope, me.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.386
( sighs )
told more truths,

14:48.388 --> 14:49.787
Did ya?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.656
Well, the thing I probably
should have mentioned

14:51.658 --> 14:55.460
Is I've never understood
the universe at all.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.063
The universe is upside down.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.432
I lied to farkle,
he loves me.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.434
I told maya the truth,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.169
She went out the window.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.704
Upside down!
You here me?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.106
<i>( creaking )</i>

15:08.108 --> 15:10.174
Hey.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.210
Well, now she's back.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.079
Maybe it's
not as upside down
as you think.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.315
It's a nice locket, maya.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.117
Thanks, mr. Matthews.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.253
It looks like someone else's
expensive gold locket.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.721
Maybe it is.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.490
But, you know,
I don't think

15:25.492 --> 15:28.192
- That matters
to maya at all.
- You don't?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.762
You know, it's an interesting
thing about lockets.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.131
It's usually
what's in the inside

15:33.133 --> 15:35.166
That matters most
to people.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.235
Isn't that right, maya?

15:47.346 --> 15:48.513
Yeah, okay.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.851
Please don't tell anyone

15:53.853 --> 15:55.753
This is how I live
in my own house.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.862
What's inside
the locket, maya,

16:04.864 --> 16:06.164
That's so important
to you?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.371
Who is this family?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.139
I don't know.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.241
( breathes deeply )
a father,

16:17.243 --> 16:18.643
A mother

16:18.645 --> 16:19.911
And a little girl.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.280
I just like that
they're all together.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.716
I'm keeping it.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.617
Oh, boy.

16:31.223 --> 16:33.324
She's at the front door too.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.461
It's like there's
two of her.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.297
- ( mimics motor whir )
- ( cory screams )

16:49.241 --> 16:51.709
So what do we do now?
Just sit here or what?

16:53.412 --> 16:55.346
Hey, dad.
Can you tell me

16:55.348 --> 16:57.415
Why I kind of think
trying to help farkle

16:57.417 --> 16:59.183
May have been wrong

16:59.185 --> 17:01.285
And maybe maya
should keep the locket?

17:01.287 --> 17:01.986
I should?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.589
Maybe.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.791
Is it me
that's upside down?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.228
You know what, girls?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.295
The universe is the most

17:11.297 --> 17:13.331
Confusing place
you'll ever live.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.635
But if you listen carefully,

17:17.637 --> 17:20.271
You'll find out
that it's paying attention

17:20.273 --> 17:22.473
And that it cares about you.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.843
Is that the truth?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.579
It's the only one
I'm still sure of.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.851
Hey, auggie,
is that for me, buddy?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.420
I made it for you.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.489
Oh, auggie,
thank you so much.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.224
Thank you.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.593
Look at this, ooh.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.762
This looks good.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.568
It's-- it's cold s'ghetti.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.969
I know it's better warmer,

17:51.971 --> 17:54.272
But I don't know
how to do that.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.775
Auggie, I appreciate

17:57.777 --> 17:59.911
That you did
anything for me at all.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.313
You said that
very nice.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
Why didn't you say it
that way to mom?

18:06.518 --> 18:08.920
What?  But all I did
was tell mom the truth.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.556
Then why do you get
cold s'ghetti?

18:13.559 --> 18:15.893
Both: Whoa.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.829
Whoa.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.332
Auggie, are you saying

18:21.334 --> 18:22.633
The truth doesn't matter

18:22.635 --> 18:24.035
As much as
how you treat people?

18:24.037 --> 18:27.271
Auggie, are you saying
that the truth does matter,

18:27.273 --> 18:28.606
But you should tell it
to people warmly?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.308
Maya:  <i>Auggie,</i>

18:30.310 --> 18:31.776
Are you saying
that the universe

18:31.778 --> 18:33.010
Pays attention to me?

18:33.012 --> 18:35.513
Do you people realize

18:35.515 --> 18:37.515
That I'm only
this many?

18:49.528 --> 18:51.662
Farkle, I need
to talk to you.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.498
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.604
Farkle.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.407
Farkle's gone.

19:03.409 --> 19:06.010
He gave up the chess club.
He gave up the chemistry club.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.979
- What happened?
- You happened.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.714
You told me I was good.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.549
Well, I just auditioned
for the next play.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.984
Are you gonna be
in the next play?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.353
I'm not even allowed
to watch the next play.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.022
I'm sorry you stink.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.325
I'm sorry
I could never hurt you.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.960
I'm sorry you stink.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.096
- I heard you!
- Well, it was very important.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.865
( sighs )

19:27.867 --> 19:29.934
You made me think
I was this great actor.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.770
You filled me up
with confidence that I was
really special.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.706
You made me think
I could go after something
totally unrealistic.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.908
Farkle...

19:36.910 --> 19:38.876
Thank you.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.549
Mmmm...

19:45.617 --> 19:46.851
Mwuah!

19:54.059 --> 19:55.927
Well...

19:55.929 --> 19:57.495
That happened.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.729
Is it over?

19:59.665 --> 20:01.832
- Can we talk about this?
- No.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.768
Because that was
your first kiss

20:03.770 --> 20:05.469
And it was with farkle.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.405
- He missed.
- Still counts.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.539
Now for the rest
of your life

20:08.541 --> 20:09.874
When people ask you,
"hey, riley,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.376
Who was your first kiss?"
you're gonna have to say...

20:12.378 --> 20:13.544
Eyes, look your last.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.779
Oh, yeah!

20:17.749 --> 20:20.051
Arms, take your last embrace.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.787
And, lips, oh,
you the doors of breath,

20:22.789 --> 20:24.956
Seal with a righteous kiss.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.558
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.693
How long you been here?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.661
Yeah, I saw the whole thing.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.929
I just can't believe
that little guy

20:31.931 --> 20:34.131
Stole my moment...
Again.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.535
You thought that
was your moment?

20:37.537 --> 20:38.970
No.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.005
Oh.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.640
My moment

20:42.642 --> 20:45.443
Will be  <i>my </i> moment.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.880
( sighs )

20:49.882 --> 20:51.749
( giggles )

20:59.057 --> 21:00.925
How you doing?

21:00.927 --> 21:03.527
I like that we end up
in situations like this.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.437
You're doing
the right thing,

21:13.439 --> 21:14.939
Returning the locket
to the store.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.207
I guess so.

21:16.209 --> 21:19.510
Maya, I know how much
you want a locket

21:19.512 --> 21:21.112
With a family inside it.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.113
You want the truth?

21:22.115 --> 21:26.884
My father hasn't sent me
anything in a long time.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.954
And the universe is
probably much too busy

21:29.956 --> 21:32.757
To notice whether or not
I'm doing the right thing.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.477
Hi.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.713
I think this belongs to you.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.515
Oh my gosh.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.949
I've been looking
all over for that.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.117
Thank you.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.066
Thank you.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.868
Never lose this.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.113
A cool universe, huh?

22:35.954 --> 22:37.088
( tapping )

22:44.029 --> 22:46.030
( sighs )
hi, auggie.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.298
Don't blow this.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.070
Hi.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.605
How you doing, honey?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.640
So...

22:56.642 --> 22:58.709
You remember that time
you were really mad at me?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.878
You mean right now?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.214
Yeah.  Yeah, that one.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.117
Listen, can I tell you
the truth about something?

23:08.787 --> 23:11.956
It doesn't really matter
what you make for dinner.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.925
It's that you are
in our house with me.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.094
Thank you for being
in our house with me.

23:19.631 --> 23:21.665
There's nowhere else
I'd rather be.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.335
Kiss kiss?

23:24.337 --> 23:26.003
Because you love me?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.004
Yes.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.140
And because
it quiets you down.
