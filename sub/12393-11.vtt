WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.989
*

00:07.000 --> 00:08.865
[muffled footsteps]

00:15.480 --> 00:17.448
- SHAWN, WHAT IN BLUE BLAZES
IS GOING ON?

00:17.480 --> 00:18.799
YOU'RE UP ON THE ROOF
IN THIS WEATHER?

00:18.850 --> 00:19.976
- NOTHING, DAD.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.772
ME AND GUS WERE JUST PRACTICING
BASE JUMPING.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.378
IT'S THE NEWEST THING IN
EXTREME SPORTS.

00:23.420 --> 00:24.944
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

00:24.990 --> 00:26.457
YOU COULD GET YOURSELF
SERIOUSLY HURT

00:26.490 --> 00:28.355
OR MAYBE EVEN KILLED
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.527
- DON'T WORRY, DAD.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.357
WE MADE LIFE-SIZE REPLICAS
OF OURSELVES

00:31.390 --> 00:32.857
TO MAKE SURE THE CHUTES
WOULD WORK.

00:32.900 --> 00:33.924
- MINE'S OVER THERE.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.825
WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS
SINCE THEN.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.669
- BASE JUMPING.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.689
SHAWN, THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET YOU

00:38.730 --> 00:39.833
DO SOMETHING THAT RISKY.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.939
- BUT, DAD?

00:40.970 --> 00:42.062
- BUT NOTHING.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.600
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE IN
MY HOUSE

00:43.640 --> 00:45.039
YOU FOLLOW MY RULES.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.628
NOW, I WANT YOU TO CLEAN
THIS STUFF UP,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.978
COME INSIDE,
AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:49.010 --> 00:50.500
GUS, COME ON.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.472
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THIS.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.647
- WELL, ONE DAY I WON'T BE
LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.489
THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE
ANY RISK I WANT.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.987
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

00:58.020 --> 00:59.009
- OKAY.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.551
WHEN YOU AND GUS
ARE 30 YEARS OLD

01:00.590 --> 01:05.380
YOU CAN GO OUT AND BE AS WILD
AND RECKLESS AS YOU WANT.

01:05.430 --> 01:08.649
- BEST IDEA
* EVERR!

01:08.700 --> 01:10.429
- PEOPLE SAY OUR INTENSE LOVE
OF BUNNIES

01:10.470 --> 01:12.734
IS CREEPY AT OUR AGE,
BUT HISTORY WILL PROVE THEM

01:12.770 --> 01:14.260
TO BE HEARTLESS BASTARDS.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.200
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE FRENCH
ACTUALLY EAT THESE LITI'LE GUYS.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.468
- THE FRENCH AREN'T
THE ONLY ONES.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.659
- WHAT?

01:18.710 --> 01:20.177
NO, I WASN'T COUNTING
OTHER RABBITS.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.472
- RABBITS DON'T
EAT EACH OTHER, SHAWN.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.978
- MOST RABBITS, YES.
- NO, PRETTY MUCH ALL.

01:24.010 --> 01:25.307
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS CONVERSATION

01:25.350 --> 01:26.317
WILL ONLY END BADLY.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.649
THE THING IS...

01:29.690 --> 01:31.112
I HAVE SOMETHING BIG
TO TELL YOU.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.754
- YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING
TO ME, GUS.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.951
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOREVER
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

01:34.990 --> 01:36.287
THAT COULD DENT
OUR IMPENETRABLE BOND.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.479
- I HAVE A SECRET GIRLFRIEND.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.554
- YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
- SHAWN?

01:38.590 --> 01:39.625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.649
YOU BROUGHT ME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE

01:40.700 --> 01:42.224
TO GET HOPPED UP
ON BUNNY LOVE

01:42.270 --> 01:43.726
SO YOU COULD SPRING THIS ON ME
AND I WOULDN'T MAKE A SCENE.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.862
- YEAH, PRETI'Y MUCH.
- WELL, IT'S WORKING.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.231
- GOOD.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.033
- I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT
THIS WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.662
GOD, THIS BUNNY IS STRONG.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.665
MUST BE COLUMBIAN.

01:50.710 --> 01:51.961
- HER NAME IS RUBY.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.637
I MET HER AT BEVMO! AND
SHE'S IN MARKETING.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.033
AND I THINK
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY COOL.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.604
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS CHICK

01:56.650 --> 01:57.844
ISN'T JUST TRYING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE CLEANERS?

01:57.880 --> 01:59.245
- WELL, ONE, ALL MY CASH
IS TIED UP IN DRESS SHIRTS

01:59.280 --> 02:00.417
AND DECORATIVE PILLOWCASES.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.042
- FAIR.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.889
WHY ARE YOU WAITING TILL JUST
NOW TO TELL ME ABOUT HER?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.239
- BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT WHAT WE HAD

02:05.290 --> 02:06.609
WAS REAL AND SOLID.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.013
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
SCREWING THINGS UP FOR ME.

02:08.060 --> 02:11.382
- YOUR DECISION TO NOT LET ME
SCOPE HER OUT IN ADVANCE

02:11.430 --> 02:13.022
COULD HAVE REPERCUSSIONS
FOR YEARS TO COME.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.994
- SHAWN, THE THING IS,
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY

02:15.030 --> 02:16.361
TO SCARE MY GIRLFRIENDS AWAY.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.822
- WHY, BECAUSE I ASK
A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS?

02:17.870 --> 02:19.360
- YOU ASKED ONE GIRL
IF SHE KNEW THE ANSWER

02:19.400 --> 02:20.594
TO THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.403
- AND BULLET DODGED.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.635
- YOU ONLY KNEW THAT BECAUSE
YOU SAW IT ON SUPER FRIENDS.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.639
- SHE HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
TO SEE THAT EPISODE, GUS.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.829
ALL RIGHT, YOU.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.972
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:30.010 --> 02:31.272
PICK THAT BUNNY BACK UP.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.870
- I WILL NOT BE EASILY SWAYED
OR IMPRESSED

02:33.920 --> 02:36.480
BY THE EFFECTS OF
AN INTENSE ADORABILITY HIGH.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.681
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
SHE'S STARTING HERE.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.812
- FINE.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.157
- AND SHE'S GOTTA GET TO HERE.
- OKAY.

02:41.190 --> 02:42.384
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.648
WHEN DO I MEET HER?
- IN ABOUT THREE SECONDS.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.328
- THREE SECONDS...

02:46.360 --> 02:48.021
- HI, HANDSOME.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.197
- RIGHT BACK AT YA.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.663
- SHE WAS TALKING
TO ME, SHAWN.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.691
RUBY, THIS IS SHAWN.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.832
- HI.
- HELLO.

02:53.870 --> 02:55.235
- IT'S SO GOOD TO MEET YOU.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.238
I'M SORRY I RAN LATE.
MY LAST APPOINTMENT RAN LONG.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.579
- SHE VOLUNTEERS
AT THE WILDLIFE RESCUE.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.373
- YEAH, WE WERE JUST CLEANING
UP THE DUCKS

03:01.410 --> 03:03.878
THAT GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE OIL SPILL.

03:03.910 --> 03:04.899
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.542
THAT SOUNDED
A LITTLE REHEARSED.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.842
DID HE GIVE YOU THAT?

03:07.880 --> 03:10.348
- SHAWN, YOU ARE AS KOOKY
AS GUS ADVERTISED.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.880
ALTHOUGH, YOU, MISTER,

03:11.920 --> 03:14.081
DID NOT DO JUSTICE
TO THAT HAIR.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.384
MY GOD, MOST GUYS I KNOW
WOULD KILL FOR THAT MANE.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.749
- SOME HAVE.

03:17.790 --> 03:19.553
- AW, WELL, NOT ME.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.726
I LIKE GUS'S HEAD.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.364
IT WOULD BE A CRIME
TO COVER THIS UP.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.028
YEAH.

03:25.070 --> 03:26.594
- GOT SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU RUBES.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.789
- OKAY, SHOOT.
ANYTHING.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.864
- ANYTHING?
- SHAWN.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.299
- YEAH.
- OH, GOOD.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.329
FAVORITE COLOR.
- BLACK.

03:31.370 --> 03:32.337
- LIAR.
- PROVE IT.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.335
- FAVORITE FLAVOR.
- OF WHAT?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.335
- EVERYTHING.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.779
- MANGO.
- TOO EASY.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.402
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- FAVORITE...

03:37.450 --> 03:39.418
MAGNUM, P.I. EPISODE.

03:39.450 --> 03:42.487
- DID YOU SEE THE SUNRISE?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.839
- SECOND FAVORITE EPISODE.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.687
- DID YOU SEE THE SUNRISE:
PART TWO?

03:45.720 --> 03:46.687
- WOW.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.950
- ACTUALLY, UH,
REVERSE THOSE TWO.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.184
YEAH.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.289
- MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU?

03:52.330 --> 03:53.524
- [chuckles]

03:53.560 --> 03:55.050
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO MEET YOU, SHAWN.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.567
- IT WAS GOOD
TO MEET YOU, RUBES.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.862
YOU'VE EXCEEDED ALL
EXPECTATIONS.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.436
- OH, THANK YOU.

03:59.470 --> 04:02.030
AND MIGHT I SAY THAT YOU
AND GUS HAVE

04:02.070 --> 04:03.662
ONE OF THE MOST RICH AND
FULFILLING FRIENDSHIPS

04:03.710 --> 04:04.768
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.061
- WE'RE LIKE ANDIE AND DUCKIE

04:06.110 --> 04:09.238
WITH JUST A TAD
OF MARY KATE AND ASHLEY.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.009
- WELL, AREN'T WE GLAD
THAT THAT'S OVER?

04:11.050 --> 04:12.244
- YES, WE ARE.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.508
I GUESS ALL
THAT'S LEFT NOW

04:13.550 --> 04:14.744
IS FOR ME TO MEET
YOUR FRIENDS.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.179
- YOU MEAN, FOR ME
TO MEET HER FRIENDS.

04:16.220 --> 04:20.418
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE I HAD IT
RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.779
OKAY, WE CAN CHANGE IT
TO WE.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.481
WHEN DO WE GET TO MEET
YOUR FRIENDS?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.157
- UH...

04:25.190 --> 04:26.851
- I'M FREE NOW.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.197
TEN MINUTES FROM NOW.

04:28.230 --> 04:29.822
ROUGHLY, AN HOUR FROM NOW.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.394
PRETTY MUCH ANYTIME BETWEEN
NOW AND TONIGHT.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.796
- SHAWN, THAT'S A LITTLE
SHORT NOTICE.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.467
- I WOULD LOVE TO,

04:35.500 --> 04:36.933
BUT I HAVE THIS THING
PLANNED TODAY.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.562
- WE WOULD LOVE TO COME.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.498
- OKAY, NORMALLY
I WOULD SAY GREAT--

04:40.540 --> 04:42.701
SERIOUSLY--BUT WE'RE MEETING
AT BERMAN'S BEND

04:42.750 --> 04:45.446
DOWN BY THE RIVER AND WE ONLY
HAVE SO MANY SUPPLIES.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.244
- NOT ENOUGH SUPPLIES.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.588
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
PUT SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS

04:49.620 --> 04:50.587
FOR NEXT WEEK.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.587
- OKAY, GOOD.
THANK YOU.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.611
SOUNDS GOOD,
SOUNDS GOOD. BYE.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.922
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.366
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE CRASHING
THEIR PICNIC.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.890
- YOU ASKED ME
TO VET THIS WOMAN.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.897
- NO, I DIDN'T.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.168
- REGARDLESS,
WHEN I VET SOMEONE

05:08.200 --> 05:09.963
I VET UNTIL THERE IS NO VETTING
LEFT TO VET.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.363
THAT IS HOW I VET, GUS.

05:11.410 --> 05:12.570
- RUBY PASSED YOUR TEST.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.498
- OF COURSE SHE WAS GOOD
AT THE PET STORE.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.632
SHE WAS PREPARED.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.602
GOTTA CATCH HER
AND HER FRIENDS UNAWARE

05:17.650 --> 05:19.743
BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET THEIR STORY STRAIGHT.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.008
- I LIKE THIS WOMAN, SHAWN.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.745
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MESS IT UP FOR ME.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.088
- DUDE, DEEP DOWN, YOU WANT
THIS TO HAPPEN.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.246
YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS

05:26.290 --> 05:27.917
SO THAT YOU CAN AVOID
ANOTHER MIRA SITUATION.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.621
OR HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN
THE WOMAN YOU MARRIED

05:29.660 --> 05:31.127
AFTER ONLY KNOWING
FOR TWO DAYS?

05:31.160 --> 05:32.184
- RUBY IS NOT MIRA.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.492
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME

05:33.530 --> 05:34.895
WHETHER A WOMAN
IS RIGHT FOR ME.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.295
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

05:36.330 --> 05:38.127
- ALMOST.
90%.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.263
- DUDE.
- FINE, 81%.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.666
- THEN LET THE VETTING
CONTINUE.

05:49.380 --> 05:50.699
- GUS.

05:50.750 --> 05:51.978
- RUBY, I'M SORRY
WE'RE DROPPING IN.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.114
- YEAH, BUT WE AGREED
TO DO THIS NEXT WEEK.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.708
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIES
FOR TWO MORE PEOPLE.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.980
- WHICH IS WHY WE BROUGHT
OUR OWN GRUYERE.

05:58.020 --> 06:01.888
- UH, NO, I THINK YOU
WANTED TO CATCH ME OFF GUARD

06:01.920 --> 06:03.353
TO SEE WHAT I WAS LIKE
WITH MY FRIENDS,

06:03.390 --> 06:04.527
DIDN'T YOU?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.027
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
OKAY.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.357
HEY, GUYS.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.722
UM, THIS IS GUS AND SHAWN.
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.260
THIS IS DEREK WALKER.
- HOW YOU DOIN'?

06:12.300 --> 06:15.030
- JESSICA MARTINO AND
MY OTHER FRIEND STU CRAWFORD.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.732
- HELLO.
- STU...

06:17.770 --> 06:19.101
SOUNDS LIKE I'M BOOING.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.107
SOUNDS LIKE I'M BOOING, RIGHT?
BUT I'M NOT.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.573
I'M SAYING STU,

06:21.610 --> 06:24.249
BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF YOURS
AND YOUR GUYS' WHOLE TEAM.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.248
- LOOK, I'M SORRY WE'RE
CRASHING IN ON YOUR...

06:26.280 --> 06:27.440
- RIVER RAFTING.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.777
- RIVER RAFTING?
- YEAH.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.946
- OH.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.287
- NO, WE THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE
HAVING A PICNIC.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.685
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE IT'S
LUNCH TIME.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.256
- IT'S 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.110
- LET ME EXPLAIN.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.253
LUNCH FOR US STARTS TEN MINUTES
AFTER BREAKFAST ENDS

06:38.290 --> 06:40.929
AND GOES TILL TEN MINUTES
BEFORE DINNER STARTS.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.325
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
WE JUST COMBINE THE TWO,

06:42.360 --> 06:43.668
IN WHICH CASE
WE HAVE LINNER.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.928
- AND THEN THERE'S DESSINNER,

06:44.970 --> 06:46.562
WHICH IS
DESSERT AND DINNER.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.828
- YOU GUYS ARE FUN.

06:47.870 --> 06:48.939
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT CRASHING ANYTHING.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.369
WE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.729
GO SEE GUNTHER, HE'LL FIX
YOU UP WITH ANYTHING YOU NEED.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.601
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
MEET US DOWN BY THE RIVER.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.870
- SWEET.
- OKAY.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.548
- ARE YOU SURE THESE OUTFITS
ARE WATERPROOF?

06:57.580 --> 06:58.604
- GUS, YOU BARELY GET WET.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.015
I'VE DONE THIS
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.847
- IT'S A SMALL WORLD
DOESN'T COUNT, SHAWN.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.781
- ALL RIGHT, FINE,
MR. QUALIFIER.

07:04.820 --> 07:08.654
GUYS, PLEASE,
LET US HELP WITH THAT.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.097
OH, I'VE MET EACH OF YOU NOW.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.951
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE MORE THAN
A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT ME.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.297
- SHAWN.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.365
- ACTUALLY, I AM.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.958
RUBY SAYS YOU'RE A PSYCHIC?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.332
CAN YOU TURN ON YOUR POWERS
AND PREDICT MY FUTURE?

07:22.370 --> 07:24.964
- DEREK, I'M A DIVINER.
NOT A BLENDER.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.409
THE PSYCHIC REALM DECIDES

07:26.440 --> 07:28.476
WHEN IT WANTS
TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.686
THOUGH I AM SENSING
THAT STU HERE

07:36.720 --> 07:38.415
IS THE EXPERT.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.815
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.317
HE IS THE MOST EXPERIENCED
RIVER RAFTER OF THE GROUP.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.988
IN FACT, IT WAS HIS IDEA
TO COME HERE TODAY.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.191
- WELL.
- THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.322
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.863
- WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT
JESSICA HERE

07:50.900 --> 07:52.424
IS A BIT OF A FREE SPIRIT.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.028
SINGLE BUT LOOKING.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.731
NOT AFRAID
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.499
- NICE.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

07:57.540 --> 07:59.508
- SHE'S TICKLING MY ASS.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.679
- THAT WAS COMPLETELY
BY ACCIDENT.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.701
THIS TIME.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.010
- SO, RU BY,

08:12.050 --> 08:13.551
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME
HOW YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS MET.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.081
- OH, WELL, DEREK AND STU

08:16.120 --> 08:17.883
MET AT A WILDLIFE
PRESERVATION MEETING,

08:17.930 --> 08:19.625
WHICH IS KIND OF IRONIC

08:19.660 --> 08:22.527
BECAUSE DEREK USED TO BE
A BIG GAME HUNTER

08:22.570 --> 08:23.867
BACK WHEN
HE WAS DATING JESSICA.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.527
- YEAH, I WENT TO AFRICA
WITH HIM TWICE,

08:25.570 --> 08:27.868
BUT ONLY FOR THE PICTURES.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.108
I LOOK REALLY GOOD
IN A SAFARI OUTFIT.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.131
- I BAGGED THE BIG 5,
THEN I TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.602
- BIG 5?

08:34.640 --> 08:38.406
MOUSE, SQUIRREL, TURTLE,
CHAD MICHAEL MURRAY?

08:38.450 --> 08:40.008
I ALWAYS FORGET
THE LAST ONE, THOUGH.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.312
- NONE OF THOSE ARE RIGHT.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.147
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
AFRICAN GAME HUNTING.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.613
- ANYWAY, SO JESSICA AND I,
WE WORK TOGETHER

08:45.650 --> 08:46.878
AND THAT'S HOW WE MET.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.558
AND THEN WHEN DEREK
AND JESSICA BROKE UP

08:48.590 --> 08:50.285
WE REALLY WANTED THEM
TO STAY FRIENDS.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.127
THAT WAY WE JUST, YOU KNOW,
WE DIDN'T BREAK THE GROUP UP.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.650
- THAT'S REALLY COOL
AND MATURE.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.497
- WE'RE A TIGHT GROUP.
WE LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.066
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GUYS?
- YEP.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.761
- WE'RE ALSO NOT AN EASY GROUP
TO KEEP UP WITH,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.734
WHICH IS WHY I GOTTA HAND IT
TO YOU TWO.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.567
YOU GUYS SEEM REALLY AT EASE
IN THE SITUATION.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.828
- WELL, I'M INTO SALES SO
I'M USED TO MEETING NEW PEOPLE.

09:04.870 --> 09:05.962
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

09:06.010 --> 09:07.477
- YOU MIGHT EVEN CALL ME
A PEOPLE PERSON.

09:07.510 --> 09:10.149
IN FACT, IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS VOTED MOST WELL-LIKED

09:10.180 --> 09:11.374
AND KING OF HOWDY-DAY.

09:11.410 --> 09:12.547
ONLY TIME IT'S EVER HAPPENED.

09:12.580 --> 09:13.717
- HEY, ARE WE
ON A FLIGHT PATH?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.445
- YOU REALLY FOOLED US, GUS.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.414
WE WOULD NEVER THINK
THAT YOU WOULD BE

09:17.450 --> 09:18.439
INTO EXTREME STUFF.

09:18.490 --> 09:19.912
- EXTREME STUFF?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.178
- LIKE THAT?

09:22.220 --> 09:23.482
- HERE WE GO.
- DEREK.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.849
- OKAY!

09:24.890 --> 09:26.255
- IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.349
- WHAT ARE THE WHISTLES FOR?
- IN CASE WE GET LOST.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.619
- WHOO-HOO!
- LOST?

09:31.670 --> 09:34.161
- WHOO!

09:35.470 --> 09:37.609
PADDLE FORWARD!
PADDLE FORWARD!

09:37.640 --> 09:40.404
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

09:40.440 --> 09:43.978
[excited screaming]

09:44.010 --> 09:46.001
- HELP ME, LORD!
- ASK HIM TO HELP ME TOO!

09:46.050 --> 09:48.644
- WHOO!
- WHOO!

09:48.680 --> 09:50.318
- ARE THOSE ROCKS REAL?

09:50.350 --> 09:52.318
- YEAH!
- [laughing]

09:52.350 --> 09:56.252
[laughing continues]
- YES!

09:56.290 --> 10:00.249
[screaming and whooping]

10:00.300 --> 10:03.269
- WHOA!
- OH, MY GOD!

10:03.300 --> 10:06.565
- FLEX YOUR CORE.
- YEAH!

10:06.600 --> 10:10.400
- IT'S THE NEXT LEVEL.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.237
YES!

10:12.270 --> 10:14.477
- YEAH!

10:14.510 --> 10:19.447
[shouting and whooping]

10:19.480 --> 10:22.017
- JESSICA'S HAND
IS STILL ON MY THIGH!

10:22.050 --> 10:27.613
[screaming and laughing]

10:27.660 --> 10:29.355
- YEAH!
- WHOO!

10:29.390 --> 10:30.618
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.218
[laughter]
- BOOM!

10:32.260 --> 10:34.228
- HA HA!

10:34.260 --> 10:37.093
- GUYS, WHERE'S STU?

10:38.900 --> 10:41.767
- STU!

10:41.800 --> 10:44.564
all: STU!

10:44.610 --> 10:46.999
- STU, CAN YOU HEAR US?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.508
- STU!
- STU!

10:49.540 --> 10:52.509
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

10:52.550 --> 10:56.270
*

10:56.320 --> 10:57.719
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES

10:57.750 --> 11:00.014
* THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY

11:00.060 --> 11:03.757
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

11:03.790 --> 11:05.678
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

11:05.730 --> 11:06.924
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

11:06.960 --> 11:12.091
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

11:12.130 --> 11:15.497
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

11:15.540 --> 11:17.804
*

11:17.840 --> 11:19.535
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

11:19.570 --> 11:21.834
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH *

11:21.880 --> 11:23.040
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

11:23.080 --> 11:24.809
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

11:24.850 --> 11:25.908
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

11:25.950 --> 11:27.577
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

11:27.620 --> 11:29.713
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

11:29.750 --> 11:32.048
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

11:32.090 --> 11:35.150
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

11:43.200 --> 11:44.462
- SO DID EITHER OF YOU SEE

11:44.500 --> 11:46.263
WHEN THIS GUY STU
FELL OUT OF THE BOAT?

11:46.300 --> 11:47.631
- THERE WAS SO MUCH WATER
PUMMELING OUR FACE

11:47.670 --> 11:48.762
WE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.199
- MOSTLY CONSISTING
OF GUS'S TEARS.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.434
- YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.677
- THE TRUTH IS, I FOUND IT
PRETTY EXHILARATING.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.075
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING
I CAN REALLY COMPARE IT TO

11:55.110 --> 11:57.271
IS THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT YOU
COULD HAVE BROWNIES DELIVERED.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.699
- EXCEPT IN THIS CASE,
A HUMAN BEING IS MISSING.

11:59.750 --> 12:00.944
- YEAH, THAT PART
WAS NOT COOL.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.117
- DAMN RIGHT IT'S NOT.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.310
CAN YOU BELIEVE
RUBY HER FRIENDS

12:03.350 --> 12:04.681
DO THIS KIND OF DANGEROUS STUFF
ALL THE TIME?

12:04.720 --> 12:05.846
- THEY'RE ADRENALINE JUNKIES.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.949
PEOPLE WHO ENJOY EXTREME
ACTIVITIES.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.617
- I KNOW WHAT
ADRENALINE JUNKIES ARE, SHAWN.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.582
- AM I CRAZY,
BUT ISN'T THE FACT

12:11.630 --> 12:12.858
THAT RUBY LIKES
TO TEMPT DEATH FOR THRILLS

12:12.900 --> 12:14.049
INFORMATION THAT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED

12:14.100 --> 12:15.226
ON THE FIRST DATE?

12:15.260 --> 12:16.488
- IF ONLY YOU KNEW SOMEONE

12:16.530 --> 12:18.964
WHO COULD'VE
VETTED THAT OUT BEFOREHAND.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.403
- GUS, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.806
- DUDE.
- SHH!

12:27.940 --> 12:30.079
- I SHOULD'VE WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE RAPIDS BEFORE.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.543
AND THAT I'M INTO
EXTREME SPORTS.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.547
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.808
- I WAS JUST REALLY AFRAID

12:33.850 --> 12:35.169
THAT IT WAS GONNA
FREAK YOU OUT.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.539
I MEAN, SOME GUYS GET
REALLY FREAKED OUT

12:36.580 --> 12:37.808
BY STUFF LIKE THAT.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.442
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I'M SURE YOU HAVE TOO,

12:39.490 --> 12:40.514
ESPECIALLY
NOW WITH STU, AND--

12:40.560 --> 12:42.687
I JUST REALLY HOPE
HE'S OKAY.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.381
- ME TOO.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.489
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

12:46.530 --> 12:48.020
NONE OF THIS SCARED ME OFF.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.652
- REALLY?

12:49.700 --> 12:52.669
OH.
- GUS.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.997
MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU

12:54.040 --> 12:56.929
IN THE "STOP SAYING CRAZY
THINGS TO RUBY" ROOM PLEASE?

12:56.970 --> 13:00.679
- GIVE US A SECOND.
- OKAY.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.439
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA BREAK UP WITH HER.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.549
- I CHANGED MY MIND.
- WHEN?

13:03.580 --> 13:04.877
- JUST NOW.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.071
- MAN, SHE LIKES TO ALMOST DIE
AND S0 D0 HER FRIENDS.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.872
IT'S LIKE WE WALKED INTO
FINAL DESTINATION.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.649
- SHAWN, WE WALKED OUT OF
FINAL DESTINATION.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.180
- WHAT?

13:12.220 --> 13:14.188
BOTTOM LINE,
SHE'S BEEN VETTED.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.051
IT'S TIME TO PUSH
THE EJECT BUTTON.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.921
- I'M NOT READY
TO DO THAT, SHAWN.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.996
- MAKE SURE CSI
COVERS THIS WHOLE AREA.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.965
- OKEYDOKE.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.365
- THAT'S STU'S VEST.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.799
- WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU FIND HIM?

13:25.830 --> 13:27.639
- YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER LEAVE
THAT TO THE PROFESSIONALS.

13:27.670 --> 13:29.194
IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE

13:29.240 --> 13:30.730
FOR ME TO SPECULATE
AT THIS TIME.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.829
- PLEASE, WE CAN HANDLE IT.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.904
- OKAY.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.703
MY BEST GUESS,
THE LIFE VEST CAME OFF

13:35.740 --> 13:36.809
WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE BOAT.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.044
HE HIT HIS HEAD ON A ROCK
AND HE DROWNED.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.638
WE'LL PROBABLY FIND
HIS BODY

13:39.680 --> 13:41.614
IN A GULLY OR A SPILLWAY
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE RIVER.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.641
I JUST HOPE THAT WE GET TO HIM
BEFORE THE BIRDS DO.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.679
- CARLTON.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.381
- WHAT? THEY SAID THEY
COULD HANDLE IT.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.685
- [sobbing]
- OH.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.393
- CLASSY, LASSIE,
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.068
STU DID GO OVERBOARD.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.307
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
HIS BODY IN A SPILLWAY

14:03.340 --> 14:05.035
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
HIT HIS HEAD

14:05.070 --> 14:06.628
AND HE DEFINITELY
DIDN'T DROWN.

14:06.670 --> 14:07.637
- SO HE JUST WHAT,

14:07.680 --> 14:08.874
TURNED INTO A FISH
AND SWAM AWAY?

14:08.910 --> 14:10.104
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.378
A CAT LIKE STU

14:11.410 --> 14:13.810
WOULD NEVER REACH INTO
COSTNER'S BAG OF TRICKS.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.738
BUT I AM PRETTY SURE
HE SWAM AWAY.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.927
ALL RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY
STU USED THE HOOKS

14:25.960 --> 14:28.599
TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO SOMETHING
IN THE WATER.

14:28.630 --> 14:29.654
- BUT WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

14:29.700 --> 14:30.792
- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.798
- GUYS.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.593
WE GOT NEWS
ON THE MISSING PERSON.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.335
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE DIVING TEAM.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.769
THEY FOUND
HIGH-STRENGTH NETTING

14:37.810 --> 14:40.108
ON THE BOTTOM OF A BIG BOULDER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAPIDS.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.698
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU
HOW THIS WENT DOWN.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.708
STU KNEW EXACTLY WHERE
TO JUMP OUT OF THAT BOAT.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.944
- AND IT HAPPENED
IN ROUGH WATER

14:44.980 --> 14:46.914
SO THAT NO ONE WOULD NOTICE
THAT HE WAS GONE.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.315
- AND THEN HE JUST WAITED
FOR THE RAFT

14:48.350 --> 14:49.715
TO DRIFT AROUND A BEND
AND HE MADE HIS WAY TO SHORE.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.047
- BUT I DON'T GET IT.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.012
WHY WOULD STU WANT TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE HE DROWNED?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.551
- BECAUSE OF THIS.

15:00.330 --> 15:02.321
- CLEARANCE SALE
AT MATTRESS DISCOUNTERS.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.361
SEEMS REDUNDANT.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.958
- NO, THIS.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.059
STU AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER
BRIAN SAMPSON

15:07.100 --> 15:08.328
JUST FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.

15:08.370 --> 15:11.134
- SAMPSON, THAT'S JUST
A GREAT NAME.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.501
STRAIGHT OUT OF FILM NOIR.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.303
AN OLD DETECTIVE
WHO DRINKS HARD

15:14.340 --> 15:16.069
BUT LOVES EVEN HARDER.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.668
OR, GO WITH ME HERE...

15:17.710 --> 15:20.110
[high-pitched voice] SAMPSON,
A TINY LI'I'I'LE ORPHAN MOUSE

15:20.150 --> 15:22.812
WHO MUST FIND HIS WAY HOME
TO WOLVERHAM PTON.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.216
- OR SAMSON, THE LEGENDARY
FIGURE FROM THE BIBLE?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.387
- NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.786
ALL THOSE GUYS HAVE NAMES
LIKE BEN-HUR AND PROMETHEUS.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.924
- YOU HAVE NEVER READ
THE BIBLE, HAVE YOU SHAWN?

15:33.430 --> 15:35.193
DEU...THE RIGHT THING.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.822
- OH, MY GOSH.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.396
- STOP TALKING.

15:38.430 --> 15:40.739
O'HARA, WE'VE GOTTA FIND
THIS BRIAN SAMPSON,

15:40.770 --> 15:41.794
BECAUSE IF THIS IS TRUE,

15:41.840 --> 15:43.307
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY
OF STU'S ESCAPE

15:43.340 --> 15:46.002
THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD'VE
DONE THIS BY HIMSELF.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.371
- HE'S RIGHT.

15:47.410 --> 15:51.141
- OH, NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S STU'S SEAT.

15:51.180 --> 15:55.219
GUS, A WORD.

15:55.250 --> 15:58.344
- WHAT?
- BAD NEWS FIRST.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.017
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
RUBY'S THE ONE

16:00.060 --> 16:01.049
WHO HELPED STU
COMMIT THIS CRIME.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.387
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.126
WE CAN USE RUBY, SOLVE
THE CASE, AND LOOK LIKE HEROES.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.422
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
- THANK YOU.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.859
- REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

16:06.890 --> 16:08.949
YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF
THAT RUBY IS WRONG FOR ME

16:09.000 --> 16:10.922
AND NOW YOU'RE FISHING
FOR SOME REASON TO JUSTIFY IT?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.369
- MAN, I KNOW
THIS IS HARD TO HEAR

16:12.400 --> 16:14.129
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE WAS INVOLVED.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.637
- THE ONLY THING
SHE'S INVOLVED IN, SHAWN,

16:15.670 --> 16:18.468
IS BEING AWESOME.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.602
- ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.868
- DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.275
- MAYBE I'M BEING
OVERPROTECT IVE

16:22.310 --> 16:24.369
BECAUSE THE WAY
THE MIRA THING WENT DOWN.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.799
- SHAWN, I APPRECIATE
YOU LOOKING AFTER ME,

16:26.850 --> 16:28.511
BUT RUBY IS NOT MIRA.

16:28.550 --> 16:31.018
OKAY?
- OKAY.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.984
THE ONLY THING SHE'S GUILTY OF
IS BEING AWESOME.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.487
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.511
- HAVE YOUR PA|\RC|§NTS MET HER?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.221
THEY'RE AT A TIME-SHARE PITCH
IN CHULA VISTA.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.557
I'LL GET US TOGETHER
WHEN THEY GET BACK.

16:39.590 --> 16:42.525
- IN THE MEANTIME,
I'VE GOT THE NEXT BEST THING.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.619
WHERE'S CHULA VISTA?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.989
I THINK THEY MADE IT UP.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.708
- SO MY HANDS ARE ALL BLOODY
AND BLISTERED

16:54.740 --> 16:56.901
FROM THREE HOURS OF FIGHTING
TO REEL IN THIS MARLIN,

16:56.940 --> 16:59.170
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
I REALIZE

16:59.210 --> 17:00.472
THAT WE'VE DRIFTED
INTO CUBAN WATERS.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.839
- WHAT?

17:01.880 --> 17:04.019
- AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE
ONE OF THEIR PATROL BOATS

17:04.050 --> 17:06.314
PROCEEDS TO BLOW A HOLE
THE SIZE OF A BOWLING BALL

17:06.350 --> 17:07.988
IN OUR HULL.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.282
HENRY, THIS BOURBON PACKS
A WALLOP.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.685
- NOT TOO STRONG FOR YOU?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.686
- OH, NO, NO, NO,
I'M PAYING YOU A COMPLIMENT.

17:12.730 --> 17:13.719
NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.749
TRY THIS.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.926
- SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

17:15.960 --> 17:18.497
- WELL, WE TURNED AND WE RAN
FOR OUR LIVES.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.294
WE MADE IT, LIKE, AROUND FIVE
MILES OFF THE COAST OF KEY WEST

17:21.340 --> 17:23.808
BEFORE SHE SANK AND THEN WE HAD
TO SWIM THE REST OF THE WAY.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.001
GET THIS, WE ENDED UP SITTING
IN WITH THE HOUSE BAND

17:26.040 --> 17:27.701
AT SLOPPY JOE'S SOAKING WET.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.345
- THAT IS THE BEST DAMN
FISH STORY I'VE EVER HEARD.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.177
' [giggling]

17:32.210 --> 17:33.973
CHEERS.

17:34.020 --> 17:37.319
YEAH, THAT WAS MY FRIEND, STU.

17:38.950 --> 17:42.386
- LOOK, I'M PRETTY SURE
WHEREVER HE IS HE'S OKAY.

17:42.420 --> 17:45.218
- YEAH.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.357
- I BETTER CHECK ON
THE BURGERS.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.198
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.377
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.002
I'M MAKING
MY WORLD-FAMOUS BURGERS.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.099
- YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING ME PROVE

18:04.150 --> 18:06.106
THAT RUBY IS HIDING SOMETHING.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.243
INSTEAD YOU'RE SWAPPING
FISHING STORIES WITH HER.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.679
AND WHAT IS THAT NONSENSE
ABOUT YOU CATCHING

18:09.720 --> 18:11.142
THE BLUEFIN TUNA?

18:11.190 --> 18:13.283
YOU FOUND IT ON THE BEACH AND
PRACTICALLY TRIPPED OVER IT.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.459
- OH, COME ON, SHAWN, LOOK.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.355
IT'S A FISHING STORY, SHAWN,
YOU EMBELLISH.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.529
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP GUS.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.595
YOU USUALLY ARE.

18:20.630 --> 18:23.497
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I'M NOT SO SURE.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.395
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

18:25.430 --> 18:27.091
- LOOK, IS IT POSSIBLE,
JUST POSSIBLE,

18:27.140 --> 18:30.303
THAT YOUR SUSPICIONS OF RUBY
STEM FROM YOUR JEALOUSY

18:30.340 --> 18:32.205
THAT GUS IS IN A HEALTHY,
SOLID RELATIONSHIP

18:32.240 --> 18:33.468
WITH A GREAT WOMAN,

18:33.510 --> 18:36.377
WHEREAS YOU HAD ONE WITH
AN EQUALLY GREAT WOMAN

18:36.410 --> 18:39.800
BUT YOU LET HER SLIP AWAY?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.548
- HOW MUCH HAVE YOU
HAD TO DRINK?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.217
- MORE THAN A LITTLE
AND LESS THAN ENOUGH.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.981
BUT I MAKE SENSE,
DON'T I?

18:49.020 --> 18:51.022
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
A BIG HIT WITH SHAWN'S DAD.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.426
- YEAH, BUT THE ONLY ONE THAT
I CAN'T WIN OVER IS SHAWN.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.325
IT'S LIKE HE DOESN'T TRUST ME
OR SOMETHING.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.329
- YEAH, WELL, HE WAS A LITTLE
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT YOU AT FIRST.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.339
- SUSPICIOUS?
- YEAH.

19:01.370 --> 19:03.907
- HOW SO?

19:03.940 --> 19:05.339
- I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T TELL YOU.

19:05.370 --> 19:07.270
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BIG LAUGH
ABOUT THIS SOMEDAY.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.175
- [laughs]

19:09.210 --> 19:10.905
- HE HAD THIS CRAZY THEORY
CAUGHT UP IN HIS HEAD

19:10.950 --> 19:13.771
ABOUT HOW YOU HELPED STU
ORCHESTRATE HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.845
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.745
THE COPS SAID THAT STU
USED SOME KIND OF WEBBING

19:17.790 --> 19:19.109
TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO A ROCK.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.812
AND SHAWN HAS IT
CAUGHT UP IN HIS HEAD

19:21.860 --> 19:23.111
THAT YOU HELPED HIM
ORCHESTRATE IT.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.252
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

19:24.290 --> 19:26.724
- HE'S REALLY PSYCHIC.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.092
- WAIT A SECOND,
YOU MEAN HE'S RIGHT?

19:29.130 --> 19:30.392
YOU DID?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.660
- GUS, STU IS MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.839
HE JUST SAID THAT HE WAS
IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE

19:34.870 --> 19:37.998
AND HE NEEDED A FEW DAYS
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.498
- WAIT, RUBY, YOU NEED TO TELL
THE POLICE ABOUT THIS NOW.

19:41.540 --> 19:44.202
- I CAN'T. STU BEGGED ME
TO GIVE HIM A FEW DAYS.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.617
I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE
WORLD THAT HE CAN TRUST, GUS.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.538
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
THAT I CAN TRUST.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.979
SO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
- WHAT?

19:51.020 --> 19:52.817
- WE'RE IN
A TRUST CIRCLE, GUS.

19:52.850 --> 19:54.954
- NO, NO, I WANT OUT
OF THE TRUST CIRCLE.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.218
- THERE ARE NO DOORS
IN THE TRUST CIRCLE, GUS.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.454
- WHAT ABOUT SHAWN?

19:57.490 --> 19:58.923
- THAT WOULD BE
A TRUST TRIANGLE.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.155
DON'T MAKE THIS MORE DIFFICULT
THAN IT ALREADY IS, OKAY?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.464
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?

20:03.500 --> 20:04.694
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

20:04.730 --> 20:06.425
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING TO SHAWN.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.665
FOR ME?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.839
- I PROMISE.
- THANK YOU.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.509
- HA HA HA!

20:13.540 --> 20:17.374
SMITHS LYRIC-OFF.
YOU, ME, 10 MINUTES.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.604
- I'M GONNA WIPE THE FLOOR
WITH YOU.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.971
WE'RE STARTING WITH
THE QUEEN IS DEAD.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.784
- 15 MINUTES.
- UH-HUH.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.453
- DUDE, I WANNA TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.048
WILL YOU LOOK AT ME, PLEASE?

20:31.090 --> 20:33.627
I JUST HAD A DRUNKEN REVELATION
OUT THERE, OKAY?

20:33.660 --> 20:34.820
IT WASN'T MINE,
IT WAS MY DAD'S,

20:34.860 --> 20:35.997
BUT AT THIS POINT,
I'LL TAKE IT.

20:36.030 --> 20:39.591
I WAS WAY OFF ABOUT RUBY,
AND I ADMIT IT.

20:39.630 --> 20:40.597
SHE'S AMAZING.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.733
IN FACT, I WISH
WE COULD CLONE HER.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.738
AND THEN MAYBE THE CLONE
WOULD COME OFF A LITTLE, UH,

20:44.770 --> 20:46.362
A LITTLE SLOW.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.809
NOT LIKE SHE HAS SPECIAL NEEDS
OR ANYTHING,

20:47.840 --> 20:49.034
JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT DIM,

20:49.080 --> 20:50.707
AND--YOU KNOW, AND THAT
WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ME.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.240
TRUTH IS, I THINK I WAS
JUST JEALOUS,

20:52.280 --> 20:54.441
'CAUSE I CAN SEE YOU GUYS
HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL

20:54.480 --> 20:55.947
AND I HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM ABIGAIL

20:55.980 --> 20:57.242
IN, LIKE, A MONTH
OR SOMETHING.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.214
- I APPRECIATE
YOUR HONESTY, SHAWN.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.424
- SO WHAT WERE YOU AND RUBES
TALKING ABOUT?

21:13.030 --> 21:14.668
- JULES, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S UP?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.258
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
AHOLD OF BRIAN SAMPSON.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.460
- SAMPSON, GREAT NAME.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.466
SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE DWARF
WARRIORS FROM WILLOW.

21:19.510 --> 21:20.807
- SHAWN, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS ALREADY.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.171
SAMPSON IS STU'S BUSINESS
PARTNER, REMEMBER?

21:22.210 --> 21:23.575
- BUT WE WERE ABLE
TO TRACK DOWN

21:23.610 --> 21:25.305
SAMPSON AND STU'S ASSISTANT,
CHARLES LUCAS.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.772
LASSITER HAS HIM
IN INTERROGATION ROOM "A"

21:26.810 --> 21:27.970
BUT HE CLAIMS THAT
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.339
- YOU WANT ME TO GET IN THERE
AND READ HIM,

21:29.380 --> 21:30.586
BECAUSE I CAN ALWAYS TELL

21:30.620 --> 21:31.712
WHEN SOMEONE IS HIDING
SOMETHING.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.183
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GUS?

21:33.220 --> 21:34.687
WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING AWAY
FROM ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.789
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT ALL
MORNING.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.117
- I HAVE SOMETHING
IN MY EYE, SHAWN.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.479
- HERE, WHAT IS IT?
- MONKEY BRUSH.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.758
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

21:39.790 --> 21:40.927
- OH, OKAY, SO NOW
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME

21:40.960 --> 21:42.222
MONKEY BRUSH
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST?

21:42.260 --> 21:44.990
- GUS, DON'T BE THE NEW
MESHACH TAYLOR.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.533
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.802
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LEAVE THIS ROOM, LUCAS,

21:51.840 --> 21:54.377
UNTIL YOU START TELLING ME
THE TRUTH.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.708
- SAYING "THE TRUTH" LOUDER
THAN THE PREVIOUS WORDS

21:56.740 --> 21:58.207
ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.571
I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.939
[door opens]

22:01.980 --> 22:03.641
- THANKS, LASSIE.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.089
- LET'S GET ONE THING
STRAIGHT, SPENCER,

22:05.120 --> 22:07.247
YOU ARE HERE TO OBSERVE THIS
INTERROGATION AND NOTHING MORE.

22:07.290 --> 22:09.713
UN DERSTOOD?
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:14.930 --> 22:16.659
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.328
YOU WERE AT THE RIVER
THE DAY THAT STU DISAPPEARED.

22:19.370 --> 22:20.962
- YEAH, I WAS THERE.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.797
BUT ONLY BECAUSE STU ASKED ME
TO DROP HIM OFF

22:22.840 --> 22:24.398
AND THEN DRIVE HIS CAR
DOWN RIVER

22:24.440 --> 22:25.702
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO CATCH A RIDE BACK.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.298
THEN I CALLED A CAB
AND WENT HOME.

22:27.340 --> 22:29.604
- YOU'RE LYING.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.198
- HE'S NOT LYING.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.138
HIS LIP IS COMPLETELY STILL,

22:33.180 --> 22:34.272
THERE'S NO SWEAT
ON THE FOREHEAD,

22:34.320 --> 22:37.073
FINGERS AREN'T TREMBLING.

22:50.670 --> 22:54.436
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.
- NO, I'M NOT.

22:54.470 --> 22:57.189
- I WANT THE TRUTH.
- THAT IS THE TRUTH.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.537
- EXACTLY WHO ARE WE
INTERROGATING RIGHT NOW?

22:58.570 --> 23:00.367
- GUS, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

23:00.410 --> 23:02.298
- I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING,
SHAWN. YOU'RE CRAZY.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.648
LASSITER, TELL HIM
HE'S CRAZY.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.749
- NO, HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

23:04.780 --> 23:07.203
- LET'S GO.

23:09.450 --> 23:11.816
- CAN I LEAVE NOW?
- QUIET.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.954
- DUDE, RUBY SAID SOMETHING
TO YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

23:13.990 --> 23:15.252
- WHO?

23:15.290 --> 23:17.485
- RUBY, WHO'S ONLY GUILTY
OF BEING AWESOME.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.781
- THEY JUST FOUND A BODY
IN THE WOODS.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.127
IT'S STU'S BUSINESS PARTNER.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.422
- SAMPSON?
- SAMPSON,

23:21.460 --> 23:23.098
THE LOVABLE SAINT BERNARD
WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR,

23:23.130 --> 23:24.597
BUT DOESN'T REALIZE
HOW BIG HE IS.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.928
- LOOKS LIKE HE WAS THE VICTIM
OF A HUNTING ACCIDENT.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.530
BUT GET THIS, I FOUND OUT
THAT SAMPSON AND STU

23:29.570 --> 23:31.709
JUST TOOK OUT MILLION-DOLLAR
LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES

23:31.740 --> 23:33.435
AND NAMED EACH OTHER
AS BENEFICIARY.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.833
- YOU THINK STU MIGHT HAVE
KILLED BRIAN FOR THE MONEY.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.404
- IT'S MOTIVE.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.579
- GUS, YOU SURE THERE'S NOTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY RIGHT NOW?

23:38.610 --> 23:41.977
- I GOTTA GO.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.982
RUBY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.622
- HI, COME ON UP.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.059
- ARE YOU NUTS?
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.226
- I KNOW IT SEEMS WEIRD,

23:57.260 --> 24:00.297
BUT THIS IS KIND OF
OUR COPING MECHANISM.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.366
- OKAY, THIS IS GETTING
RIDICULOUS .

24:02.400 --> 24:04.630
WHATEVER YOU AND RUBY
ARE ABOUT TO CONSPIRE TO DO

24:04.670 --> 24:05.932
IS JUST AS BAD, I'M SURE.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.062
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MURDER HERE, GUS.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.338
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.075
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
RIGHT NOW, SHAWN.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.670
- YOU KIDDING ME?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.810
DUDE, THIS IS ME.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.442
I AM YOUR PARTNER
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND

24:19.490 --> 24:21.287
AND WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO KEEP
SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.651
- I KNOW, SHAWN,
BUT IT'S COMPLICATED.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.055
- NO, MATH IS COMPLICATED.

24:24.090 --> 24:25.955
THE SHOW IT'S COMPLICATED
WAS COMPLICATED.

24:25.990 --> 24:27.594
THE SONG COMPLICATED
BY AVRIL LAVIGNE,

24:27.630 --> 24:30.349
IRONICALLY, NOT--
NOT VERY COMPLICATED.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.958
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEITHER IS THIS.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.558
- HEY, SHAWN.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.192
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.037
LOOK WHO'S LEARNING
TO BE THE AGGRESSIVE ONE.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.935
- I'M SORRY, BUT I AM NOT
HERE TO SEE YOU, JESSICA.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.575
- YEAH,
AND I'M WEARING PANTIES.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.174
- LISTEN TO ME,

24:49.220 --> 24:50.881
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE POLICE.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.114
AND IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING
AND WE DON'T TELL THEM,

24:52.150 --> 24:53.583
THAT'S THE SAME AS LYING.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.259
- OH, SO SHOULD I TELL THEM
YOU'RE NOT REALLY PSYCHIC?

24:56.290 --> 24:58.383
- HOW DID YOU GET
FROM "A" TO "B"?

24:58.430 --> 25:01.319
- SHAWN! HEY, BUDDY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:01.360 --> 25:04.397
- OH, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
CHASING AFTER JESSICA.

25:04.430 --> 25:05.920
- YEAH, DON'T THEY ALL.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.767
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS MEANS ANYTHING,

25:07.800 --> 25:09.768
BUT I THINK YOU TWO
WOULD MAKE A GREAT COUPLE.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.802
MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE YOU
MY KEY TO HER APARTMENT.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.173
- MAYBE.

25:15.210 --> 25:18.099
- YOU KNOW, THAT WAY,
YOU CAN GET IN.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.503
- I GOT IT.

25:19.550 --> 25:21.245
I DO.

25:21.280 --> 25:25.387
DUDE, YOU HAVE TO STOP
LETTING RUBY COME BETWEEN US.

25:25.420 --> 25:26.887
- I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN, SHAWN.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.888
- HEY, HI.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.989
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.885
- RUBY, I CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.625
I NEED TO LET SHAWN
IN OUR TRUST CIRCLE.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.799
- I'M JUST GONNA PRETEND LIKE
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

25:35.830 --> 25:40.529
RUBY, THE POLICE THINK THAT STU
MAY HAVE KILLED BRIAN SAMPSON.

25:40.570 --> 25:42.561
- BRIAN'S DEAD?
- YEAH.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.034
AND I KNOW THAT YOU HELPED
STAGE STU'S DISAPPEARANCE.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.129
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.070
- GUS TOLD YOU?
- OF COURSE HE DID.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.999
BUT STU--STU COULD'VE
NEVER KILLED BRIAN

25:52.050 --> 25:53.449
NO MATTER HOW MUCH BRIAN
MAY HAVE DESERVED IT.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.913
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

25:54.950 --> 25:57.418
- WELL, BRIAN WAS THE REASON
THAT STU WAS GOING BROKE.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.213
HE USED ALL
OF THE COMPANY'S MONEY

25:59.250 --> 26:00.911
TO PAY FOR HIS EXORBITANT
LIFESTYLE.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.781
- HUH, IT'S ALWAYS
ABOUT MONEY.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.355
- YEAH.
TELL HIM EVERYTHING, RUBY.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.051
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE STU IS.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.027
- AND JUST WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.128
- WITH YOU
TO THE POLICE STATION.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.535
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.037
- SHAWN, NOW THAT
RUBY'S TOLD US

26:16.070 --> 26:18.106
STU IS HIDING NEAR LONE PINE,
WE HAVE TO TELL THE POLICE.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.438
- CORRECTION.
I HAVE TO TELL THE POLICE.

26:20.470 --> 26:21.869
YOU HAVE TO CRAWL BACK
UNDER YOUR

26:21.910 --> 26:23.639
KEEPING-SECRETS-FROM-
YOUR-BEST-FRIEND ROCK

26:23.680 --> 26:24.704
AND APPLY FOR PERMANENT
RESIDENCY--

26:24.750 --> 26:25.842
- SHAWN--

26:25.880 --> 26:27.006
- WHERE YOU CAN VOTE
AND PAY YOUR TAXES

26:27.050 --> 26:28.745
AND MAKE LITTLE BACKSTABBING
ROCK BABIES.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.338
- DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW?
- YES, WE DO.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.881
BECAUSE I'M BEGINNING
TO QUESTION YOUR DEDICATION

26:31.920 --> 26:35.219
TO THIS CASE, OUR PARTNERSHIP,
AND MAYBE EVEN AMERICA.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.353
- I'M AS DEDICATED AS EVER.
I TAKE OUR JOB SERIOUSLY.

26:37.390 --> 26:40.723
- PLEASE, YOU ARE SO DISTRACT ED
BY RUBY AND HER BOOBS

26:40.760 --> 26:42.648
AND YOUR LIES
AND THE HEAW PETTING,

26:42.700 --> 26:44.588
THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHO JASON IS.

26:44.630 --> 26:46.689
- YOU MEAN STU, SHAWN.
- OR WHO HE KIDNAPPED.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.867
- HE DIDN'T KIDNAP ANYONE.
HE DISAPPEARED.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.094
- THAT'S RIGHT.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.562
RIGHT OFF THE TOP
OF A BUILDING IN VANCOUVER.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.409
- THAT WAS AN ART THIEF WHO
DIDN'T ACTUALLY STEAL ANYTHING.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.668
- AND THEN FELL DOWN
A MINE SHAFT.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.178
- THAT WAS US.
LOOK, GIVE IT UP, SHAWN.

26:56.210 --> 26:58.178
THE FACT IS, MY TRUST CIRCLE
WITH RUBY

26:58.210 --> 27:00.246
NOT WITHSTANDING, I'VE BEEN
PAYING JUST AS MUCH ATTENTION

27:00.280 --> 27:01.679
TO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
AS YOU HAVE.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.244
- YOU CAN'T HAVE A CIRCLE
WITH TWO PEOPLE.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.009
- SO LET'S SET ASIDE
OUR PERSONAL ISSUES

27:05.050 --> 27:06.540
AND CONTINUE
ON OUR INVESTIGATION.

27:06.590 --> 27:09.718
- PLEASE, YOU WISH YOU HAD
MY ACUTE OBSERVATIONAL SKILLS.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.149
- YOU WISH YOU HAD MY FOCUS.
- MY ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

27:12.190 --> 27:15.193
- ATTENTION TO DETAIL,
PLEASE.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.845
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.246
BY PIECING TOGETHER
STU'S CREDIT CARD ACTIVITY,

27:37.280 --> 27:40.317
PHONE RECORDS, AND KNOWN
SIGHTINGS THE LAST THREE WEEKS,

27:40.350 --> 27:42.409
WE'VE PINPOINTED HIS PRECISE
LOCATION TO HERE:

27:42.460 --> 27:44.189
A SMALL RANCH OUTSIDE
OF RENO, NEVADA.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.549
WE NEED TO COORDINATE

27:45.590 --> 27:48.297
WITH ALL STATE AND LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.197
- PSYCHIC NAVIGATORS ARE SAYING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, LASSIE.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.458
- WOULD YOU CUT THAT OUT
BEFORE YOU BLIND SOMEBODY?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.900
- AS USUAL, LASSIE,
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

27:59.940 --> 28:05.003
THE ACTUAL POSITION WHERE STU
IS HIDING IS HERE,

28:05.050 --> 28:06.199
RIGHT OUTSIDE OF LONE PINE.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.445
- AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

28:08.480 --> 28:11.688
- SAME WAY I KNEW THAT STU
HAD FLED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.812
THE QUESTION IS, LASSIE,

28:12.850 --> 28:15.648
DO YOU WANT TO MOBILIZE
YOUR TEAM TO NEVADA

28:15.690 --> 28:17.749
AND RISK HUMILIATING YOURSELF,

28:17.790 --> 28:19.280
OR DO YOU WANNA MOBILIZE THEM
TO LONE PINE,

28:19.330 --> 28:22.959
WHICH IS ON THE WAY, AND ONLY
RISK HUMILIATING ME?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.321
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S HEAD TO LONE PINE.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.031
STAY PUT, SPENCER.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.546
- STU CRAWFORD, IT'S THE SBPD.
WE'RE COMING IN.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.182
- YOU KNOW, I'M STILL MORE
THAN A LITTLE PEEVED AT YOU

28:47.220 --> 28:48.289
FOR KEEPING ALL THIS FROM ME.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.981
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
BUT YOU KNOW,

28:50.020 --> 28:51.578
EVENTUALLY WE'RE GONNA BOTH
GET MARRIED.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.848
THERE'S GONNA BE CERTAIN THINGS
WE CAN'T SHARE WITH EACH OTHER.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.652
- I'M TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.123
WE'RE STILL GONNA LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.319
- HELL YEAH,

28:59.370 --> 29:01.588
WITH A POOL GOING ACROSS
BOTH OF OUR YARDS.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.062
- I'VE GOT DIBS
ON THE DIVING BOARD.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.408
- YEAH, OKAY.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.466
- SPENCER, GUSTER,
WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THERE?

29:17.250 --> 29:20.185
WELL, YOU HAD EVERYTHING
RIGHT, SPENCER.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.915
HE DEFINITELY DIDN'T DROWN
IN THE RIVER.

29:27.630 --> 29:29.825
- I KNOW THIS MUST BE
VERY HARD.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.590
BUT SINCE STU DIDN'T LEAVE
A SUICIDE NOTE,

29:32.630 --> 29:34.791
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN TELL US?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.660
- I'VE KNOWN STU FOR YEARS,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.806
AND NONE OF THIS
MAKES ANY SENSE.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.206
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONE.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.845
- NOW, RUBY'S ALREADY
INFORMED US

29:44.880 --> 29:47.474
OF HER INVOLVEMENT
WITH STU'S DISAPPEARANCE.

29:47.510 --> 29:48.943
IF EITHER OF YOU TWO
WERE INVOLVED,

29:48.980 --> 29:50.447
NOW'S THE TIME TO TELL US.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.119
- THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

29:53.150 --> 29:55.084
- ACTUALLY,
STU CAME TO ME FIRST

29:55.120 --> 29:57.111
SAYING THAT HE NEEDED
A PLACE TO HIDE.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.128
AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDED
TO STOP BEING A COWARD

29:59.160 --> 30:00.821
AND JUST FACE HIS PROBLEMS
LIKE A MAN.

30:00.860 --> 30:04.318
- STU TOLD ME THAT I WAS THE
ONLY PERSON THAT HE TRUSTED.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.826
- THAT IS SO LIKE YOU
TO THINK

30:05.870 --> 30:07.838
THAT YOU'RE THE SPECIAL ONE
IN THE GROUP.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.235
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT RUBY.

30:09.270 --> 30:10.794
- I NEED ATTENTION?

30:10.840 --> 30:11.909
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THROWS HERSELF

30:11.940 --> 30:13.032
AT EVERY GUY THAT SHE MEETS.

30:13.070 --> 30:14.537
- OH, TAKE IT BACK, BITCH!

30:14.580 --> 30:16.605
- OKAY, WHOA, LADIES,
SIMMER DOWN.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.039
- HOLD ON CHIEF, MAKE HER.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.174
CAN YOU--
TRY TO MAKE HER.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.780
- LOOK, MISS MARTINO, WE KNOW
THAT YOU'VE HAD SOME

30:23.820 --> 30:25.913
COURT-APPOINTED
ANGER MANAGEMENT SESSIONS

30:25.950 --> 30:28.009
AND A PRIOR FOR STALKING

30:28.060 --> 30:29.413
STU'S BUSINESS PARTNER
BRIAN SAMPSON.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.859
- OH, THAT?

30:30.890 --> 30:33.688
STU INTRODUCED US AT A PARTY
AND WE TOTALLY HIT IT OFF.

30:33.730 --> 30:36.756
AND THEN BRIAN STARTED SENDING
ME MIXED SIGNALS.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.358
MIXED SIGNALS.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.527
- OKAY, WELL,
LET'S JUST SAY

30:40.570 --> 30:41.867
THAT YOU'RE A PERSON
OF INTEREST

30:41.900 --> 30:43.299
AND WE'D LIKE YOU
TO STAY IN TOWN.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.661
- FINE.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.733
- AM I FREE TO GO TOO, NOW?

30:50.780 --> 30:54.011
- YEAH, YOU TOO, MISS J.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.918
- WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE?

30:57.950 --> 31:02.159
- WELL, THE PREPONDERANCE
OF EVIDENCE STILL POINTS

31:02.190 --> 31:04.750
TO STU BEING RESPONSIBLE
FOR BRIAN SAMPSON'S MURDER.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.827
- ALTHOUGH, IN VIEW OF THE
PERFORMANCE WE JUST WITNESSED,

31:07.860 --> 31:09.157
I THINK WE SHOULD RE-REVIEW
SAID EVIDENCE.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.497
- YOU CAN'T RE-REVIEW
SOMETHING, SHAWN,

31:10.530 --> 31:11.758
IT'S REDUNDANT.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.324
LIKE RE-REPEAT
OR RE-REFLECT.

31:13.370 --> 31:16.237
- YOU CAN IF YOU'VE PEATED
AND FLECT ED TWICE.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.158
- NEED I REMIND YOU GUYS THAT
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN HIRED

31:18.210 --> 31:20.531
ON THIS CASE, AND THEREFORE,
WHAT YOU SAY DOESN'T MATTER?

31:20.570 --> 31:22.709
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN HIRED?
- NOBODY HIRED ME.

31:22.740 --> 31:25.675
- WE'LL CALL YOU
IF WE NEED YOU.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.844
- I'M SORRY ABOUT STU.

31:33.890 --> 31:36.711
- OH, I'M SORRY ABOUT PUTTING
YOU IN THIS SITUATION.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.648
- HEY, YOU WERE DOING A GOOD
THING FOR A GREAT FRIEND.

31:38.690 --> 31:39.657
I CAN'T BE MAD AT THAT.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.624
- THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

31:41.660 --> 31:45.061
- SO NOW THAT EVERYTHING'S
OUT IN THE OPEN, LET'S AGREE.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.624
- YES.
- NO MORE SECRETS.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.695
- OKAY, AGREED, YES.
NO MORE SECRETS.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.231
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT. [clears throat]

31:51.270 --> 31:52.601
BOTTLE AND WEAVE.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.631
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.103
- DIVORCED.
- OH.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.607
BABY DADDY?
- NO.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.402
- CREDIT?
- 770.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.941
- NOT BAD.
- YAY!

32:02.980 --> 32:05.744
- OH, YOU GUYS.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.189
THIS IS SO NICE.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.758
THIS FEELS GOOD.

32:10.790 --> 32:12.985
I KNEW YOU WERE SPECIAL
FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU.

32:13.030 --> 32:16.022
YOU HAD ME AT DID YOU SEE
THE SUNRISE: PART TWO.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.254
- UH, SHAWN?

32:17.300 --> 32:19.825
- UH, I'M GONNA WAIT
IN THE CAR.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.134
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.035
- I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HER
FROM THE BEGINNING.

32:24.070 --> 32:25.662
SHE IS AMAZING.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.837
I AM 110%
ON THE RUBY TRAIN NOW.

32:27.870 --> 32:30.031
- GOOD, SHE JUST LOST
A DEAR FRIEND.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.843
SHE NEEDS US, GUS.
WE'RE HER ROCK.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.348
- YOU MEAN, I'M HER ROCK.
- YES, YOU'RE HER ROCK.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.018
I'M HER ANCHOR.
- STOP IT, SHAWN.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.415
- STOP WHAT?
- YOU KNOW WHAT.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.589
- THAT?
- YES, THAT.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.554
- I ONLY DID THAT BECAUSE YOU
SAID STOP DOING THIS.

32:41.590 --> 32:42.955
IF I STOP DOING THAT,
THEN WHAT?

32:42.990 --> 32:44.184
- STOP STOPPING IT, SHAWN.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.255
YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.497
YOU FEEL BAD THAT YOU WERE
AGAINST RUBY FROM THE BEGINNING

32:48.530 --> 32:50.020
SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO OVERCOMPENSATE

32:50.060 --> 32:52.267
BY PUSHING YOUR WAY
INTO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.131
BUT I'M NOT UPSET

32:54.170 --> 32:55.933
BECAUSE I KNOW
DEEP DOWN IT'S JUST YOUR WAY

32:55.970 --> 32:57.631
OF SAYING I HAVE
A GOOD THING IN RUBY

32:57.670 --> 33:00.468
AND YOU DON'T WANNA
SEE ME LOSE IT.

33:00.510 --> 33:02.705
- ALL RIGHT, YOU CONSOLE
YOUR LADY.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.071
I'LL HANDLE THE CASE
FOR A WHILE.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.044
- YOU MEAN, THE CASE
WE DIDN'T GET HIRED ON?

33:06.080 --> 33:08.071
- YOU KNOW HOW I ROLL.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.086
HEY, OLD BUDDY, RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU'VE MISSED YOU.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.088
- OKAY, HOLD ON,
LET ME GUESS.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.781
POLICE WON'T LET YOU IN ON
ANOTHER CASE.

33:17.820 --> 33:18.889
YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU GET
AROUND THEM.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.852
- I THOUGHT
I WAS THE PSYCHIC.

33:20.890 --> 33:23.825
BUT I COME BEARING GIFTS.

33:23.860 --> 33:26.499
I FIGURED YOUR SLENDER TOES
MUST GET A LITTLE CHILLY

33:26.530 --> 33:27.827
DOWN HERE ON THE BLOCK.

33:27.870 --> 33:28.939
- THEY DO.
- YEAH.

33:28.970 --> 33:29.994
- THANK YOU.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.008
ALL RIGHT, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

33:32.040 --> 33:34.338
- IS THAT BIG BRIAN SAMPSON
ON THE SLAB?

33:34.380 --> 33:36.837
- YEP. HANDSOME DUDE GOT
A BIG OL' HOLE IN HIS PEC.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.541
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING

33:38.580 --> 33:40.070
THAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD
WHEN I SAY SAMPSON?

33:40.110 --> 33:41.611
- A VACUUM YOU CAN USE
IN SPACE.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.379
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.648
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.646
- WELL, EVEN THOUGH THE BULLET
WAS NOT FOUND,

33:46.690 --> 33:50.717
IN MY OPINION, IT LIKELY CAME
FROM A WINCHESTER 70 RIFLE.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.354
- GET OUT OF THIS DEATH IGLOO.

33:53.390 --> 33:54.994
YOU CAN TELL THAT JUST BY
LOOKING AT THE HOLE?

33:55.030 --> 33:56.452
- CORRECT YOU ARE,
MY NICELY GELLED FRIEND.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.024
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

33:58.070 --> 34:01.494
- OOH.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.690
- OF COURSE, WATERMELON.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.809
PERFECT SUBSTITUTE
FOR THE HUMAN HEAD.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.432
- UNCANNY.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.199
- PORTERHOUSE SIMULATES
THE HUMAN THIGH.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.377
- YEP.

34:09.410 --> 34:12.868
- THE MAPLE WOOD
SIMULATES OAK WOOD.

34:12.910 --> 34:14.070
UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS IS ALL ACADEMIC

34:14.120 --> 34:15.712
UNLESS WE CAN FIND
THE ACTUAL MURDER WEAPON.

34:15.750 --> 34:16.819
- BELIEVE ME,
YOU'VE HELPED

34:16.850 --> 34:19.410
MORE THAN YOU COULD
POSSIBLY KNOW.

34:19.450 --> 34:22.487
WORCES. ..
WORCESTER.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.329
- THE SAUCE?
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.850
WESTCHESTER.
- THE COUNTY?

34:25.890 --> 34:27.687
- COUNTIES CAN'T KILL PEOPLE,
JULES.

34:27.730 --> 34:29.652
WIN....

34:29.700 --> 34:31.361
WIN?

34:31.400 --> 34:32.890
- CHESTER!
- YES!

34:32.930 --> 34:34.761
69...

34:34.800 --> 34:35.937
- 70.
- YES!

34:35.970 --> 34:38.131
- JESSICA MARTINO
OWNS A WINCHESTER 70.

34:38.170 --> 34:40.900
- THAT IS A VERY GOOD LINK
TO THE MURDER OF BRIAN SAMPSON.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.033
LET'S PAY MISS MARTINO
A LITTLE VISIT, SHALL WE?

34:43.080 --> 34:45.503
- I'LL CALL GUS, TELL HIM AND
RUBY TO STAY AWAY FROM JESSICA.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.269
[cell phone ringing]
- WHAT'S UP.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.447
- GUS, STAY AWAY
FROM JESSICA.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.186
- YOU HOOKED UP WITH HER?

34:52.220 --> 34:54.017
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
NO, SHE MIGHT BE THE MURDERER.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.312
- WHAT?
- JUST MAKE SURE

34:55.360 --> 34:56.850
YOU AND RUBY
DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

34:56.890 --> 34:58.289
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT RUBY,
SHE'S FINE.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.456
SHE SAID SHE HAD TO
CLEAR HER HEAD

34:59.490 --> 35:01.048
SO SHE AND DEREK
WENT PARAGLIDING.

35:01.090 --> 35:02.057
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S HOW THEY COPE.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.692
- OF COURSE IT IS.

35:07.030 --> 35:10.363
- OH, THIS WAS
A GREAT IDEA, DEREK.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.732
THINGS HAVE JUST BEEN
SO OUT OF CONTROL THIS WEEK.

35:12.770 --> 35:15.477
I REALLY NEEDED SOMETHING
TO TAKE MY MIND OFF OF STU.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.330
- NO PROBLEM.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.007
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GLIDE
DOWN THE VALLEY

35:19.050 --> 35:20.176
AND THEN HIKE BACK UP.

35:20.210 --> 35:21.211
I'M JUST GONNA PUT
OUR COORDINATES IN

35:21.250 --> 35:23.013
SO WE TAKE THE SHORTEST PATH.

35:23.050 --> 35:25.041
- OH, WHO DO YOU KNOW
IN LONE PINE?

35:25.090 --> 35:27.183
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE AREA
THAT I TOLD STU ABOUT.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.757
HOW DID...

35:29.790 --> 35:31.280
DEREK.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.390
IT WAS YOU.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.354
OH, NO, NO, THERE'S NO WAY.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.322
- I REALLY WISH YOU
HADN'T SEEN THAT, RUBY.

35:48.910 --> 35:50.730
- THAT WAS JULES.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.407
THEY FOUND THE RIFLE
IN JESSICA'S APARTMENT.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.542
THEY ARE BOOKING HER NOW.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.116
- MAN, SHE WAS CRAZY.

35:55.150 --> 35:57.072
GLAD WE FOUND OUT NOW BEFORE
YOU GUYS HOOKED UP.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.247
- WHEN WAS I EVER GONNA
HOOK UP WITH JESSICA?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.281
- SHAWN, PLEASE, YOU KNOW
HONEY WAS FLY.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.413
- SHE'S A MURDERER, GUS.
PLUS, IT WAS CREEPY.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.020
SHE STALKS BRIAN,
SHE DATES DEREK.

36:06.060 --> 36:07.721
SHE WAS HOT.
- I KNOW.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.057
- WITH LEGS
I COULD'VE CLIMBED.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.055
- WHAT?

36:11.670 --> 36:12.989
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT
MEANS ANYTHING,

36:13.030 --> 36:14.531
BUT I THINK YOU GUYS WOULD MAKE
A GREAT COUPLE.

36:14.570 --> 36:17.698
MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE YOU
MY KEY TO HER APARTMENT.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.867
- WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE
DEREK USED TO BE

36:19.910 --> 36:23.129
A BIG GAME HUNTER BACK
WHEN HE WAS DATING JESSICA.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.738
- YOU SEE, WE'RE
A TIGHT-KNIT GROUP.

36:24.780 --> 36:27.704
WE LOOK OUT FOR OUR OWN.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GUYS?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.342
- OH, NO.

36:29.380 --> 36:31.519
- WHAT?
- RUBY'S IN DANGER.

36:31.550 --> 36:32.778
I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.209
- I JUST PUT MY CAR
IN THE SHOP.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.319
- HOLD ON TIGHT.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.797
- I CAN'T EVEN
PROCESS THIS, DEREK.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.151
STU WAS OUR FRIEND.
HOW COULD YOU KILL HIM?

36:44.200 --> 36:45.792
- FRIEND?

36:45.830 --> 36:47.991
STU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE
MEANING OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.998
TRUE FRIENDS
STAND BEHIND ONE ANOTHER.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.565
SEE, STU AND I HAD A PACT.
- ALL RIGHT.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.329
- ALL RIGHT, I WOULD MAKE BRIAN
PAY FOR WHAT HE DID

36:55.380 --> 36:56.631
AND THEN I WAS GONNA LET STU

36:56.680 --> 36:57.977
CASH IN ON
THE INSURANCE POLICY.

36:58.010 --> 37:00.205
- RIGHT.
- BUT I HELD UP MY END.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.444
- OKAY, UH...

37:01.480 --> 37:03.243
- BUT STU--STU DECIDED TO GET
A CONSCIENCE.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.044
- OKAY. WHOA! AHH!
AAH! AAH!

37:06.090 --> 37:08.251
WHY--WHY DON'T, UM,

37:08.290 --> 37:12.886
WHY DON'T YOU AND I JUST MAKE
A--A PACT RIGHT NOW?

37:12.930 --> 37:15.524
A PACT THAT NEITHER OF US
IS GONNA KILL ME.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.652
[chuckles nervously]

37:18.470 --> 37:22.668
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE ADRENALINE RUSH YOU GET

37:22.700 --> 37:24.634
WHEN YOU TRACK DOWN
AND KILL A MAN.

37:24.670 --> 37:27.559
IT'S LIKE LIGHTNING RUNNING
DOWN YOUR SPINE.

37:27.610 --> 37:31.068
NONE OF THIS STUFF COMPARES.

37:31.110 --> 37:34.568
- I ALWAYS SENSED THAT YOU WERE
THE STRONGEST OF THE GROUP.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.111
AND I ENVIED JESSICA
THAT SHE GOT TO BE WITH YOU.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.640
YOU KNOW THAT?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.908
- PLEASE DON'T INSULT
MY INTELLIGENCE.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.111
- FINE, BUT I HAD TO TRY.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.787
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE A DOUCHE BAG,

37:44.830 --> 37:46.752
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
AS DUMB AS A WILDEBEEST.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.997
- SORRY IT HAD TO END
THIS WAY, RUBY.

37:49.030 --> 37:50.520
- NO, DEREK!
PLEASE, NO, PLEASE!

37:50.560 --> 37:52.096
- HEY, STEP AWAY
FROM MY LADY.

37:52.130 --> 37:53.358
- PLEASE!
AHH!

37:53.400 --> 37:55.038
- DON'T MOVE.
ONE STEP AND SHE'S GONE.

37:55.070 --> 37:56.435
- GUS.

37:56.470 --> 37:57.937
- IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

37:57.970 --> 37:59.460
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, D?

37:59.510 --> 38:01.102
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.870
YOU KILLED BRIAN SAMPSON
BECAUSE HE RUINED STU.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.275
[gunshot]

38:09.620 --> 38:11.918
BUT INSTEAD OF THANKING YOU,
HE TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

38:11.950 --> 38:13.747
- BECAUSE HE WASN'T CRAZY.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.257
AND YOU KNEW IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

38:15.290 --> 38:17.110
BEFORE HE CRACKED
AND WENT TO THE AUTHORITIES.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.720
SO YOU USED YOUR KEY
TO GET INTO JESSICA'S PLACE

38:19.760 --> 38:21.159
TO TAKE BACK
THE RIFLE YOU GAVE HER

38:21.190 --> 38:23.226
FROM YOUR BIG GAME
HUNTING DAYS.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.921
- YOU DONE?
- YEAH.

38:24.970 --> 38:29.634
- FINALLY, YOU TRACKED DOWN
YOUR BUDDY LIKE A DESERT FOX,

38:29.670 --> 38:31.433
AND KILLED HIM, MAKING IT
LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE.

38:31.470 --> 38:34.598
THUS, PINNING THE MURDER
OF BRIAN SAMPSON ON STU.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.132
[distant siren wails]

38:38.180 --> 38:39.875
-AAH!

38:39.910 --> 38:42.140
- RUBES.

38:45.890 --> 38:49.815
- FREEZE!
SBPD!

38:49.860 --> 38:51.452
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANWVHERE.

38:51.490 --> 38:52.957
I GOT HIM, SHAWN.
GET OFF ME.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.457
WHAT--WHAT--SHAWN!
- AAH.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.991
- SHAWN! SHAWN!
SAVE ME!

38:57.030 --> 38:59.828
- HANG ON TIGHT, GUS.
- [groaning]

38:59.870 --> 39:01.565
- COME ON, COME ON.
- DON'T LET GO.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.636
- WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE BOTTOM.
- SHAWN!

39:03.670 --> 39:06.537
[siren wailing]

39:06.570 --> 39:07.832
- ALL RIGHT,
HE'S HEADING SOUTH.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.076
COVER ALL CLEARINGS.

39:09.110 --> 39:10.532
- BACK UP, MOVE SOUTH
TO OPEN FIELD.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.002
OH, HE'S NOT EVEN HOOKED IN.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.449
- DON'T WORRY,
WHEN GUS IS SCARED,

39:13.480 --> 39:15.368
HE CAN CLING TO SOMETHING
LIKE A DROWNING CAT.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.308
- DON'T LET ME DIE,
SHAWN!

39:30.330 --> 39:34.960
- [grunting
and groaning]

39:35.000 --> 39:36.331
- GUS!

39:36.370 --> 39:37.962
- ALMOST THERE!
- THANK YOU, LORD.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.935
- GUS!
- DUDE, THAT WAS AMAZING!

39:40.970 --> 39:43.177
- YOU MANHANDLED A KILLER
AND YOU TOOK HIM TO THE GROUND.

39:43.210 --> 39:45.349
- IT WAS NOTHING.
A MAN PROTECT S HIS LADY.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.940
- YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.141
[laughing]

39:50.180 --> 39:51.579
MWAH!

39:51.620 --> 39:53.611
- HEY, I'M YOUR ROCK.
I'M YOUR ISLAND.

39:53.650 --> 39:54.878
- OH, I KNOW.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.148
- HEY, HOW DO YOU GET
THIS DAMN THING OFF?

39:56.190 --> 39:59.079
- OH, HERE LET ME HELP YOU.
YOU UNTWIST THIS.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.358
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

40:00.390 --> 40:01.721
- WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

40:01.760 --> 40:03.899
- I SQUEEZED HIM SO TIGHT,
HE PASSED OUT BY ACCIDENT.

40:03.930 --> 40:05.261
- NICE.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.767
- OH, AND MY HELMET SMASHED
INTO HIS CHIN BY MISTAKE.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.394
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA SAY
THAT YOU MUSCLED UP HIS BACK

40:09.440 --> 40:11.192
AND THEN YOU PUT HIM IN
A SLEEPER HOLD ON PURPOSE.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.231
- SOUNDS GOOD.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.781
- NEXT LEVEL'S GONNA BE DOPE.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.186
- RUBY'S HOME SAFE AND SOUND.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.188
- THERE HE IS.

40:30.220 --> 40:33.519
I GOTTA SAY, THAT WAS AWFULLY
BOYFRIEND-Y OF YOU,

40:33.560 --> 40:36.529
JUMPING OUT THERE RISKING DEATH
LIKE THAT TO SAVE RUBY.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.027
SHE IS LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU, DUDE.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.927
AND I MEAN JUST YOU, ALL YOU,
NOTHING BUT THE YOU.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.130
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW.

40:42.170 --> 40:43.364
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A BREATHER
FOR A WHILE.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.004
- WE ARE?
- YEAH.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.304
I MEAN, AS YOU KNOW
OUR RELATIONSHIP STARTED OFF

40:47.340 --> 40:50.173
A LOT MORE ACTION-PACKED
AND EXCITING THAN MOST.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.178
- YOU MEAN, WITH PEOPLE
DISAPPEARING, DYING,

40:52.210 --> 40:53.245
AND BEING ARRESTED?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.145
- YEAH, AND
A LOT OF HEAW FOODS.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.172
- SO YOU TWO HAVE DECIDED
TO TAKE A STEP BACK

40:58.220 --> 41:00.085
AND EVALUATE
IF THE ATTRACTION IS REAL?

41:01.390 --> 41:02.687
AND THEN WHEN EVERYTHING
GETS BACK TO NORMAL,

41:02.720 --> 41:04.187
IF THE FEELINGS
ARE STILL THERE,

41:04.220 --> 41:05.528
WE'LL START SEEING EACH OTHER
AGAIN.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.256
- HE'S ALL GROWNS UP.

41:08.290 --> 41:12.294
MAKING GROWNS-UP DECISIONS.
WHAT!

41:12.330 --> 41:13.968
IT WAS HER IDEA, WASN'T IT?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.128
- OF COURSE IT WAS.
I WAS BEGGING.

41:17.170 --> 41:20.003
- OH, GUS.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.634
I DID SOME
SOUL SEARCHING TOO.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.604
WHAT IF WE HAD TO GO
ON THE LAM LIKE STU,

41:25.650 --> 41:29.518
AND WE ENDED UP IN THE SIERRAS
OR SOMEPLACE WAY FAR AWAY

41:29.550 --> 41:30.812
FROM CIVILIZATION,

41:30.850 --> 41:32.579
WITH NO CELL PHONES,
AND NO WATER,

41:32.620 --> 41:36.181
IT WAS JUST US, AND WE'RE LOST
NEVER TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN?

41:36.220 --> 41:38.017
- THAT WOULD SUCK.
- IT SURE WOULD.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.996
SO THEN I STARTED THINKING,
IF THAT'S US--

41:42.030 --> 41:45.659
DEATH AND STARVATION
ARE IMMINENT--

41:45.700 --> 41:49.966
HOW LONG WOULD YOU WANT ME
TO WAIT BEFORE I ATE YOU?

41:50.000 --> 41:53.163
- I WON'T DIGNIFY THAT
WITH AN ANSWER, SHAWN.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.201
- IT'S A PERFECT LY
REASONABLE QUESTION.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.434
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A LIVING WILL.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.777
- NO ONE PLANS FOR THAT.

41:57.810 --> 41:59.949
- JULES, WOULD YOU TELL GUS
IT'S NORMAL FOR FRIENDS

41:59.980 --> 42:01.379
TO DISCUSS WHEN
THEY'D LIKE TO BE EATEN

42:01.410 --> 42:03.640
IN THE EVENT OF A TRAGIC
ALIVE-ESQUE SCENARIO?

42:03.680 --> 42:06.046
- EWW!
- THANK YOU.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.445
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M WITH SPENCER ON THIS ONE.

42:08.490 --> 42:10.958
I WOULD EAT THE THREE OF YOU
IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:

42:10.990 --> 42:13.026
O'HARA, GUSTER, THEN SPENCER.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.482
I'VE ALSO MADE A LIST
OF WHOSE ORGANS

42:14.530 --> 42:16.225
I'D PREFER IN THE EVENT
I NEED A TRANSPLANT.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.125
AND I'VE PLANNED
FOR THE CONTINGENCY

42:18.160 --> 42:19.525
WHERE I'M
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH

42:19.570 --> 42:20.821
AND I NEED TO CHOOSE ONE PERSON
FROM THE DEPARTMENT

42:20.870 --> 42:23.259
WITH WHOM TO PROCREATE.

42:26.410 --> 42:28.799
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
NONE OF YOU MADE THE LIST.
