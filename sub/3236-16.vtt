05:29.820 --> 05:33.206
I was just calling
to see if we can set--

05:33.257 --> 05:34.874
Well, yes, well, I figured

05:34.925 --> 05:37.493
we have to do
the interview by phone

05:37.511 --> 05:39.662
since they've already
left New York.

really love to get

is a photo of
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

05:43.217 --> 05:45.552

Gotcha.

is Upper Canyon Road.

No, it isn't.

- You could transplant it

07:55.432 --> 07:57.317
to Islamabad,
I would still eat there.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.801
Ooh, there's a good thought.

07:58.819 --> 08:01.654
- What, Islamabad?
- No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

Oh, my God,
all this talk of food.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.409

left us anything?

08:06.443 --> 08:07.827

coming back on Wednesday.

we have any of those--

crackers with the,

08:25.713 --> 08:27.881
like, the sun-dried
tomato and then

08:27.932 --> 08:29.382
they were kind of
slightly peppery,

08:29.433 --> 08:30.934
but not too peppery.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.001
We don't have them?

I don't know.

doesn't get those anymore.

take a walk to it?

10:28.635 --> 10:30.619
It's just parked down the road.

10:30.637 --> 10:33.222
I couldn't get it
past your gate.

10:40.297 --> 10:42.965
Elliott,

10:42.983 --> 10:44.984
if we're gonna go that way,

10:45.019 --> 10:47.653
you'll need a bigger knife.

10:52.910 --> 10:54.694
[Knife clatters]

10:57.544 --> 10:58.744
[Walt] Keep stacking.

11:06.569 --> 11:09.387
That's all right.

11:09.405 --> 11:11.990

throw it on top.

11:14.994 --> 11:16.394

11:16.412 --> 11:19.081
We don't want to lose
any under the furniture.

11:22.418 --> 11:24.753
All right.

11:24.787 --> 11:29.207
That is $9,720,000.

11:29.241 --> 11:30.626
Where did it come from?

11:30.677 --> 11:33.679
And why is it here?

11:33.713 --> 11:35.047
I earned it,

11:35.081 --> 11:36.748
and you're going to
give it to my children.

11:36.766 --> 11:38.216
What? Why?

11:38.250 --> 11:39.405
Walt, I don't
think we--

11:39.515 --> 11:41.353
On my son's 18th birthday,

11:41.387 --> 11:42.638
which is ten months

11:42.689 --> 11:44.923
and two days from today,

11:44.941 --> 11:47.092
you will give him this money

11:47.110 --> 11:49.278
in the form
of an irrevocable trust.

11:49.312 --> 11:51.446
You will tell him
that it is his

11:51.481 --> 11:54.432
to do with as he sees fit,

11:54.450 --> 11:56.151
but with the hope

11:56.202 --> 11:59.538
that he uses it for
his college education.

11:59.572 --> 12:01.373
And for the betterment
of his family.

12:01.407 --> 12:04.609
Walt, I'm not sure
that we follow.

12:04.627 --> 12:07.462
Why, uh, I mean,

12:07.497 --> 12:09.331
why, in particular,
would we--

12:09.382 --> 12:11.133
If you wanna give
your kids drug money,

12:11.167 --> 12:12.501
go do it yourself.

12:12.552 --> 12:14.219
I can't.

12:14.253 --> 12:16.672
My wife and son hate me.

12:16.723 --> 12:19.391
They won't take my money.

12:19.425 --> 12:21.093
Even if they did,

12:21.127 --> 12:23.478
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

12:25.565 --> 12:27.649
But two rich benefactors,

12:27.684 --> 12:30.319
who are known for their
charitable endeavors,

12:30.353 --> 12:32.137
who would think nothing
of, for instance,

12:32.155 --> 12:34.439
writing a $28 million check

12:34.473 --> 12:38.360
to help victims of
methamphetamine abuse?

12:38.411 --> 12:40.779
I have to think that your money

12:40.813 --> 12:41.997
would be very welcome.

12:42.031 --> 12:44.315
It wouldn't make
any sense coming from us.

12:44.334 --> 12:45.984
It certainly would.

12:46.002 --> 12:48.153
My children are
blameless victims

12:48.171 --> 12:50.839
of their monstrous father.

12:50.873 --> 12:53.375
A man who you
once knew quite well.

12:59.766 --> 13:00.832
Call it a beau geste,

13:00.850 --> 13:02.184
call it liberal guilt,

13:02.218 --> 13:03.552
call it whatever you want,

13:03.603 --> 13:05.504
but do it.

13:05.538 --> 13:08.640
And you are not to spend

13:08.675 --> 13:12.277
a single dime
of your own money.

13:12.311 --> 13:13.879
If there are taxes

13:13.913 --> 13:16.548
or lawyers' fees owed,

13:16.582 --> 13:18.316
you will take it
right from here.

13:18.351 --> 13:21.236
They use my money, never yours.

13:21.287 --> 13:22.854
Okay, Walt, sure.

13:22.872 --> 13:25.123
That--
that sounds reasonable.

13:27.377 --> 13:30.245
So what happens next?

13:30.296 --> 13:32.581
I guess we shake on it,

13:32.632 --> 13:34.633
and I leave.

14:03.946 --> 14:06.748
I can trust you to do this.

14:06.783 --> 14:08.250
Yes.

14:08.284 --> 14:11.286
Absolutely you can.

14:25.918 --> 14:26.968
Oh!

14:27.019 --> 14:28.637
Don't move.
Don't...

14:28.688 --> 14:30.105
Don't dare move a muscle.

14:30.139 --> 14:31.273
You don't want them to think

14:31.307 --> 14:33.058
that you're trying to get away.

14:33.092 --> 14:34.476
Just breathe.

14:37.063 --> 14:38.263
Just this afternoon,

14:38.281 --> 14:40.398
I had an extra $200,000

14:40.432 --> 14:41.783
that I would have loved dearly

14:41.818 --> 14:45.153
to leave on top of this table.

14:45.204 --> 14:46.955
Instead,

14:46.989 --> 14:48.824
I gave it to the two best

14:48.875 --> 14:52.244
hitmen west of the Mississippi.

14:52.278 --> 14:54.612
Now,

14:54.630 --> 14:59.835
whatever happens
to me tomorrow,

14:59.886 --> 15:01.970
they'll still be out there.

15:03.973 --> 15:06.791
Keeping tabs.

15:06.809 --> 15:08.176
And if,

15:08.227 --> 15:10.345
for any reason,

15:10.396 --> 15:14.465
that my children
do not get this money,

15:14.484 --> 15:16.685
a kind of...

15:16.736 --> 15:18.970
countdown will begin.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.306
Maybe a day or so later,

15:21.324 --> 15:22.774
maybe a week, a year,

15:22.808 --> 15:24.826
when you're going for
a walk in Santa Fe

15:24.861 --> 15:27.812
or Manhattan
or Prague, wherever,

15:27.830 --> 15:29.831
and you're...

15:29.866 --> 15:32.868
talking about
your stock prices...

15:35.171 --> 15:39.424
without a worry in the world.

15:39.458 --> 15:42.043
And then suddenly,

15:42.094 --> 15:43.929
you'll hear the scrape

15:43.963 --> 15:45.380
of a footstep behind you,

15:45.431 --> 15:47.465
but before you can
even turn around,

15:47.499 --> 15:49.500
- pop!
- Aah!

15:54.357 --> 15:56.358
Darkness.

16:02.398 --> 16:05.033
Cheer up, beautiful people.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.071
This is where
you get to make it right.

16:23.336 --> 16:26.338
[Gretchen sobs]

16:58.237 --> 17:00.238
Oh, yeah, right.

17:08.347 --> 17:09.513
You know, I don't exactly

17:09.548 --> 17:11.683
know how to feel
about all this.

17:11.717 --> 17:13.184
For real, yo.

17:13.219 --> 17:15.854
Whole thing felt kinda shady,
you know, like,

17:15.887 --> 17:17.055
morality-wise?

17:17.089 --> 17:19.089
Totally.

17:20.592 --> 17:24.429
How do you feel now?

17:24.446 --> 17:25.596
Better.

17:25.615 --> 17:28.433
Yeah, definitely improving.

17:28.451 --> 17:29.985
[Walt] What's this I hear about

17:30.036 --> 17:33.622
blue meth still
being out there?

17:33.656 --> 17:34.623
What do you mean?

17:34.657 --> 17:36.458
Have you heard anything?

17:36.492 --> 17:38.493
Is it still being sold?

17:40.997 --> 17:42.998
Yeah.

17:47.336 --> 17:49.387
By whom?

17:49.422 --> 17:52.557
It's you, right?

17:52.591 --> 17:54.509
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

17:57.980 --> 17:59.230
Damn, man.

17:59.265 --> 18:00.932
We were sure it was you,

18:00.966 --> 18:02.600
because that shit
is choice, yo.

18:02.634 --> 18:03.985
Better than ever.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.354
I mean, um, you know.

18:08.658 --> 18:09.858
Jesse.

18:09.909 --> 18:10.975
Seriously?

18:10.993 --> 18:12.694
You said he moved to Alaska.

18:12.745 --> 18:14.812
That's what I heard.

18:14.830 --> 18:15.947
Right on, Jesse.

18:15.981 --> 18:17.982
Passing the torch.

18:17.983 --> 18:21.230
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

19:08.351 --> 19:10.452
[Blows]

20:02.839 --> 20:06.508
Wow, what happened there?

20:06.542 --> 20:08.126
It's my birthday.

20:08.177 --> 20:10.595
Yeah? Well,
happy birthday.

20:58.478 --> 21:00.128
[Hank] <i>It's easy money.</i>

21:00.146 --> 21:01.646
<i>Until we catch you.</i>

21:01.681 --> 21:02.764
Walt, just say the word

21:02.798 --> 21:04.466
and I'll take you
on a ride-along.

21:04.484 --> 21:06.651
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

21:06.686 --> 21:09.571
Get a little excitement
in your life.

21:09.605 --> 21:11.940
Someday.

21:38.935 --> 21:40.001
Welcome to The Grove.

21:40.019 --> 21:41.103
Would you like to see a menu?

21:41.137 --> 21:42.187
No, thank you.

21:42.221 --> 21:44.022
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

21:44.056 --> 21:45.840
All right, you got it.

22:01.290 --> 22:03.458
Hey, how you doing?

22:03.493 --> 22:05.377
Good.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.662
How's things?

22:07.696 --> 22:09.697
Hey, I like your...

22:12.084 --> 22:13.368
shirt.

22:13.386 --> 22:14.386
My blouse?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.371
Nice, yeah, the color.

22:16.389 --> 22:19.558
That's a nice color on you.

22:19.592 --> 22:20.926
It's kind of a--

22:20.977 --> 22:22.511
I don't know exactly
what you'd call it.

22:22.545 --> 22:26.231
It's kind of a cornflower.

22:26.265 --> 22:27.566
Before you say or do anything,

22:27.600 --> 22:30.435
just hear me out.

22:30.486 --> 22:31.553
Todd--

22:31.571 --> 22:32.887
Nobody knows that I'm here.

22:32.905 --> 22:34.856
Just listen for two minutes

22:34.890 --> 22:36.408
and then I'll leave.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.776
Please.

22:37.827 --> 22:39.161
Please.

22:39.195 --> 22:40.562
Just two minutes of your time.

22:40.580 --> 22:43.582
That's all I ask.

22:44.750 --> 22:45.867
Please.

22:52.008 --> 22:54.676
You're running out
of methylamine, aren't you?

22:54.710 --> 22:57.212
I can do the math.

22:57.246 --> 22:58.547
You've been at it long enough.

22:58.581 --> 23:01.516
You must be running low.

23:01.551 --> 23:04.719
I have a new method

23:04.753 --> 23:06.638
that requires no methylamine.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.889
And it's easy, and it will

23:07.923 --> 23:09.090
keep you in business.

23:09.108 --> 23:11.593
And Todd, I could
teach it to you.

23:11.611 --> 23:14.779
How did you know
to find us here?

23:14.814 --> 23:17.782
10:00 AM
every Tuesday morning,

23:17.817 --> 23:19.734
you and I met here.

23:19.768 --> 23:21.603
You're rather...

23:21.621 --> 23:23.371
schedule-oriented,
I guess.

23:23.406 --> 23:26.608
[Coughs]

23:37.503 --> 23:39.954
Sorry.

23:45.961 --> 23:48.763
I need the money.

23:48.797 --> 23:51.683
I've spent almost all of mine.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.236
Already, just trying to stay

23:54.270 --> 23:56.655
one step ahead of the police.

23:56.689 --> 23:59.658
Mr. White, I don't
think there's--

23:59.692 --> 24:04.329
How much would it cost us?

24:04.363 --> 24:06.114
Nothing short of a million,

24:06.148 --> 24:07.666
and believe me, for this,

24:07.700 --> 24:11.536
that is--
is giving it away.

24:11.587 --> 24:12.987
I think Jack should hear this.

24:13.005 --> 24:14.873
Yeah, I don't know.

24:14.924 --> 24:17.325
Now listen, I can--

24:17.343 --> 24:19.294
I can come up there tonight

24:19.328 --> 24:21.296
and talk to him.

24:21.330 --> 24:23.164
He'd get it.

24:23.182 --> 24:26.718
This is a win-win
situation.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.470
Hi, what can I get for you two?

24:28.504 --> 24:29.971
He's just leaving.

24:30.005 --> 24:32.524
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

24:36.178 --> 24:38.012
For you?

24:38.030 --> 24:39.230
I'm good.

24:39.282 --> 24:41.700
And I need more stevia.

24:51.294 --> 24:52.744
Okay, no disrespect to the man,

24:52.795 --> 24:54.379
but doing business with him?

24:54.413 --> 24:55.747
Right now,
that's not--

24:55.798 --> 24:58.583
Of course, we're not
doing business with him.

25:00.136 --> 25:01.869
Todd, please.

25:01.887 --> 25:04.038
Don't make me
walk you through this.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.979
Jesus.
Did you look at him?

25:12.765 --> 25:15.767
You'd be doing him a favor.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.767
[Walt coughs]

25:45.959 --> 25:47.593
[Walt hums]

25:47.627 --> 25:50.045
[Humming continues]

25:56.803 --> 25:59.271

[Phone beeps]

27:16.683 --> 27:19.468
Hey.

27:19.502 --> 27:21.270
What's up?

27:21.304 --> 27:23.522
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

27:23.556 --> 27:24.690
Yeah?

27:24.724 --> 27:26.475
That car they thought he stole

27:26.509 --> 27:27.643
in New Hampshire,

27:27.677 --> 27:29.227
they found it in
a Denny's parking lot

27:29.279 --> 27:30.845
right on Central.

27:30.863 --> 27:32.698
<i>And your old</i>
<i>next-door neighbor,</i>

27:32.732 --> 27:34.483
<i>the one on the right,</i>
<i>what's her name, Becky?</i>

27:34.517 --> 27:36.702
Becky's on the left.
Carol's on the right.

27:36.736 --> 27:38.320
<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

27:38.354 --> 27:40.855
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

27:40.873 --> 27:43.125
Just this morning,
plain as day.

27:43.159 --> 27:45.193
He's there, walking
out of your house,

27:45.211 --> 27:47.879
and he calls her by name.

27:47.914 --> 27:50.382
He didn't hurt her, did he?
He didn't--

27:50.416 --> 27:52.701
No, he's just like,
"Hey, Becky!"

27:52.719 --> 27:55.387
Or Carol, whatever.

27:55.421 --> 27:58.173
<i>She said he looked</i>
<i>exactly like the Unabomber,</i>

27:58.207 --> 27:59.841
<i>but she's positive it was him.</i>

27:59.875 --> 28:01.927
Skyler, we're getting
calls from all over town.

28:01.978 --> 28:03.512
He's here, he's there,

28:03.546 --> 28:05.063
he's going
to blow up city hall.

28:05.098 --> 28:06.732
Apparently he has
some sort of manifesto.

28:06.766 --> 28:08.233
He wants to be on
the six o'clock news.

28:08.267 --> 28:10.602
<i>- It's just--</i>
- Who's making these calls, him?

28:10.653 --> 28:12.154
<i>There are two or three</i>
<i>different voices.</i>

28:12.188 --> 28:13.722
<i>They're not sure</i>
<i>if they're crank calls</i>

28:13.740 --> 28:15.574
<i>or people he's put up to it</i>

28:15.608 --> 28:18.026
<i>or if they're actual</i>
<i>anonymous tips.</i>

28:18.060 --> 28:19.194
<i>And it's stretching them thin,</i>

28:19.228 --> 28:20.729
<i>which is maybe the point.</i>

28:20.747 --> 28:22.531
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>and I've told them this,</i>

28:22.565 --> 28:24.199
there are three places
that he would go.

28:24.233 --> 28:26.568
To you, to me, or Flynn.

28:26.586 --> 28:28.570
<i>Right.</i>

28:28.588 --> 28:30.238
They're watching
the high school.

28:30.256 --> 28:33.759
They're probably
watching your place, too.

28:33.793 --> 28:36.094
I mean,

28:36.129 --> 28:38.797
I know that's what
Hank would do.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.799
There's no way
Walt's getting to you.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.635
They are absolutely
going to catch him.

28:43.686 --> 28:44.936
No doubt about it.

28:44.971 --> 28:46.388
That arrogant asshole thinks

28:46.422 --> 28:47.922
he's some criminal mastermind,

28:47.940 --> 28:49.474
but he's not.

28:49.525 --> 28:51.426
<i>But on the off-chance...</i>

28:51.444 --> 28:53.445
Yeah.

28:53.479 --> 28:56.898
On the million-to-one
chance...

28:58.651 --> 29:00.318
you be on the lookout, okay?

29:04.657 --> 29:06.408
Thanks.

29:09.212 --> 29:11.613
You got it.

29:13.833 --> 29:16.334
[Phone beeps]

29:29.199 --> 29:31.700
Five minutes.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.792
Five minutes.

29:46.082 --> 29:47.799
You didn't kill anybody

29:47.834 --> 29:51.386
sneaking in here, did you?

29:51.421 --> 29:52.671
You didn't hurt anybody?

29:52.722 --> 29:54.806
No.

29:54.841 --> 29:57.342
Didn't have to.

30:08.738 --> 30:11.607
You look terrible.

30:11.641 --> 30:14.743
Yeah.

30:14.777 --> 30:17.863
But I feel good.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.916
So talk.

30:22.368 --> 30:24.002
Why are you here?

30:34.547 --> 30:37.766
It's over.

30:37.800 --> 30:42.104
And I needed a proper goodbye.

30:42.138 --> 30:44.139
Not our last phone call.

30:46.025 --> 30:48.527
So you're going to the police?

30:50.897 --> 30:52.814
They'll be coming to me.

30:52.848 --> 30:57.319
If you're in custody,

30:57.353 --> 30:59.037
what stops those people
from coming back,

30:59.072 --> 31:00.855
those people you worked with?

31:00.873 --> 31:05.877
When-- when I still
had the house,

31:05.912 --> 31:07.045
three men came

31:07.080 --> 31:08.380
in the middle of the night,

31:08.414 --> 31:11.466
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

31:11.501 --> 31:13.385
They told me not to talk about

31:13.419 --> 31:14.720
that woman I saw
at the car wash,

31:14.754 --> 31:16.588
and if you're in custody
and they find out--

31:16.639 --> 31:17.872
They're not coming back.

31:17.890 --> 31:20.559
Not after tonight.

31:20.593 --> 31:22.561
What's tonight?

31:28.735 --> 31:32.854
We don't want your money, Walt.

31:32.888 --> 31:35.240
I thought Flynn
made that clear.

31:35.274 --> 31:37.492
He did.

31:37.527 --> 31:40.729
And I don't have any
to give you.

31:40.747 --> 31:45.334
I spent the last
of it getting here.

31:45.368 --> 31:48.737
All I have to give you

31:48.755 --> 31:50.756
is this.

32:01.751 --> 32:04.052
Call the DEA once I leave.

32:04.086 --> 32:05.771
Tell them I was here.

32:05.805 --> 32:08.523
That I forced my way in.

32:08.558 --> 32:12.927
Tell them...

32:12.945 --> 32:14.780
Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs

32:14.814 --> 32:17.983
on my birthday,

32:18.034 --> 32:21.536
and that I gave you
that ticket.

32:21.571 --> 32:25.624
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

32:25.658 --> 32:27.659
For what?

32:30.329 --> 32:33.582
A burial site.

32:33.616 --> 32:36.618
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

32:40.306 --> 32:43.792
That's where
I buried our money.

32:43.810 --> 32:46.561
The men who stole it from us,

32:46.596 --> 32:49.514
the men who still have it,

32:49.565 --> 32:51.983
they murdered Hank and Steve

32:52.018 --> 32:54.519
and put them in that hole.

32:56.439 --> 32:58.740
Now you trade that

32:58.775 --> 33:01.309
for a deal with the prosecutor.

33:01.327 --> 33:04.196
You get yourself out of this.

33:04.247 --> 33:06.248
Skyler.

33:08.584 --> 33:10.585
Skyler.

33:13.673 --> 33:17.175
All the things that I did,

33:17.210 --> 33:18.326

to understand--

33:18.344 --> 33:21.096
If I have to hear

33:21.130 --> 33:23.765
one more time

33:23.800 --> 33:25.600
that you did this

33:25.635 --> 33:26.768
for the family--

33:26.803 --> 33:28.804
I did it for me.

33:35.511 --> 33:40.348
I liked it.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.701
I was good at it.

33:44.821 --> 33:47.239
And...

33:47.290 --> 33:49.791
I was...

33:49.826 --> 33:52.527

33:56.632 --> 33:58.633
I was alive.

Where to?

38:10.438 --> 38:12.455
To the clubhouse.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.572
Just go ahead, just park it

38:29.606 --> 38:31.607

38:33.610 --> 38:35.161
No, no, no,
just straight in, man,

lift your shirt up?

39:21.876 --> 39:24.511
Give us a spin.

39:24.545 --> 39:26.829

with that head of hair.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.139
Is that real?

40:10.174 --> 40:11.808
Yes.

40:11.842 --> 40:12.976
That's not a wig?

40:13.010 --> 40:14.177
Seriously?

40:14.211 --> 40:15.511
No.

40:15.545 --> 40:18.481
What were you doing before,
shaving it?

40:18.515 --> 40:19.566
Yes.

40:19.600 --> 40:23.353
Christ, that is one
fine head of hair.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.188
I mean, otherwise you
look like shit, but--

40:25.222 --> 40:27.740
Hello to you too, Jack.

40:27.775 --> 40:29.993
Can we talk business?

40:30.027 --> 40:32.862
I don't think so, no.

40:32.896 --> 40:34.831
Did Todd tell you
what I'm offering?

40:34.865 --> 40:36.399
Yeah, he told me.

40:36.417 --> 40:38.201
Thing is, we're...

40:38.235 --> 40:39.953
not really in the market.

40:42.206 --> 40:43.623
You're running low
on methylamine,

what happens then?

40:44.792 --> 40:47.877
No, we'll get more.

40:47.911 --> 40:49.429
That Quayle woman's
got her own set-up.

40:49.463 --> 40:51.247
The heat's off her.

40:51.265 --> 40:53.082
She can break loose a barrel
every now and again.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.851
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

40:54.885 --> 40:57.637
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

40:57.688 --> 41:00.306
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

41:01.775 --> 41:05.061
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

41:06.814 --> 41:08.815
I'm sorry.

41:11.452 --> 41:12.785
Wait. Jack.

41:12.820 --> 41:13.936

41:13.954 --> 41:15.438
Well, gee, I don't know,

41:15.456 --> 41:16.539
anywhere but my living room?

41:16.573 --> 41:17.606
Take him out back.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.208
- Jack, you owe me.
- Hey, come on.

- You owe me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.611
I owe you, what for?

41:22.630 --> 41:24.163
Jesse Pinkman,
you promised that

41:24.214 --> 41:26.132
you would kill him,
and you didn't.

41:26.166 --> 41:28.418
Instead, you
partnered with him.

You're his
partner now--

He's cooking for you.

41:44.985 --> 41:47.737
What, are you gonna lie?

41:47.771 --> 41:48.938
Him being alive is not

41:48.972 --> 41:50.657
him and me being partners.

41:50.691 --> 41:52.659
Not by a damn sight.

41:52.693 --> 41:54.944

I'd partner with a rat?

41:54.978 --> 41:56.946
Where's that little
piece of shit?
