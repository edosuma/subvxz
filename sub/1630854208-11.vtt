WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:06.407
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...
Mom!

00:06.507 --> 00:09.443
You both need to leave
town immediately.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.611
Everything okay?

00:10.711 --> 00:11.612
Miles again.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.147
Wanting to talk about Dee?

00:13.247 --> 00:15.049
And everything that happened
with that dirty bomb.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.186
<i>First you bring a gunshot victim
to my house.</i>

00:18.286 --> 00:19.753
<i>Then I get a call from Aunt Vi</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:21.055
<i>saying that I need to come
get our daughter.</i>

00:21.155 --> 00:22.123
I'm concerned, Rob.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.924
You must trust me.
I tried.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.992
You leave me no choice.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.560
Hey, Mom, is everything okay?

00:26.660 --> 00:27.861
I just got served.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.698
Your father wants
sole custody of you.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.725
Hey. What are you doing?!

00:57.825 --> 00:58.992
Get out of here!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.128
Go, go, go!

01:20.981 --> 01:22.716
I know that look.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.586
Whenever you are scheming,

01:25.686 --> 01:27.821
you tap your right foot.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.158
You've done it since
you were a child.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.026
This about Miles?
He's coming over
this afternoon.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.564
I have to convince him
to drop this custody case

01:36.664 --> 01:37.898
before court on Monday.

01:37.998 --> 01:41.269
He has no idea how
this could expose what I do,

01:41.369 --> 01:42.470
cost me Dee.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.904
So, what's the plan?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.508
Good morning.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.577
Is it?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.078
Everything all right?

01:52.546 --> 01:56.184
My parents are fighting
over my custody.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.585
Everything's awesome.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.621
Look, me and your dad

02:00.721 --> 02:02.256
are gonna work
this whole thing out.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.591
Trust me.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.193
It's never gonna make it
as far as the courts.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.027
Okay.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.497
Anything else on your mind?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.566
No.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.536
I'll see everyone
after school.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.673
Why are you making promises
to that child

02:19.773 --> 02:21.074
you may not be able to keep?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.417
This is why.

02:39.427 --> 02:42.162
Robyn, are you
gonna use this?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.864
Miles has left me no choice.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.435
Some lines can't be uncrossed.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.241
I know.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.878
But I will do what I have to do
to protect my family.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.552
It started a few weeks ago

03:04.652 --> 03:07.020
with broken car windows
on Shabbat

03:07.120 --> 03:09.690
and mezuzahs torn
from shop doorways.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.026
Hmm. Symbols meant
to protect against evil,

03:13.126 --> 03:14.362
guarantee safety.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.366
Last night, Cheryl,
who works at our family deli,

03:18.466 --> 03:21.235
tried to stop these guys
from vandalizing a Jewish mural

03:21.335 --> 03:24.037
outside our parking lot
and was knocked unconscious.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.339
Is she okay?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.441
Yes. Thankfully.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.877
Sh-She's like
a second mom to me.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.613
The police-- what did they say?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.682
They took a statement,

03:34.782 --> 03:36.784
said they'd look into it,

03:36.884 --> 03:39.086
but their hate crime force
is spread pretty thin

03:39.186 --> 03:41.389
and I'm concerned
whoever's behind this

03:41.489 --> 03:42.823
is just getting started.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.393
You believe they're related?
I think so.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.961
Cheryl saw a handful of men
in ski masks

03:48.061 --> 03:50.063
and there's been other sightings
of masked men

03:50.163 --> 03:51.532
throughout our Midwood neighborhood.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.767
The entire Jewish
community's on edge.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.537
Can you help us before someone
else gets seriously hurt?

03:56.637 --> 03:59.440
Hate like this
has no place anywhere.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.542
Let me see what I can do.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.111
Thank you.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.014
Mitzi's deli in Midwood?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.116
That's your old
stomping grounds.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.118
Wow, haven't thought about
that place in a long time.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.587
Best chocolate babkas
in Brooklyn.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.856
Got me through some rough times.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.525
Look, I know this one
might be sensitive.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.226
Hey, it's fine.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.762
You know, growing up with a
Jewish mom and an Armenian dad,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.331
I can't say I knew where I stood
in the community,

04:23.431 --> 04:24.832
but I definitely know
where I stand on hate crimes.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.835
Look at this.
Anti-Semitic incidents

04:27.935 --> 04:30.504
were at an all-time high
last year in the U.S.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.708
and assaults up 167%.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.243
No wonder the Jewish community
is scared.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.111
Okay, I think we
should start...
Whoa, hold on.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.813
I thought you said
you had to go meet Miles.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.749
Yeah, but Rebekah
needs our help.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.651
No, no, no, listen,
you got to take care of yourself

04:43.751 --> 04:45.052
and your family.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.354
We got this one.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.655
Mm-hmm.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.290
Well, I can at least
call Dante.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.259
He can send forensics
to the crime scene.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.927
I'll go check the deli out
and just see

04:54.027 --> 04:55.496
if there were any clues
that were overlooked.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.197
I'll talk to Cheryl,
see if she can give us anything

04:57.297 --> 04:58.599
on the mural incident.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.134
And I'll circle back
when I'm done with Miles.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.413
Never ends, does it?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.649
You know, when I was a kid,
growing up Jewish,

05:15.749 --> 05:17.918
they instill all this fear
in you, you know.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.887
Like, "You're white until
they find out you're Jewish."

05:19.987 --> 05:22.055
"Don't wear a Star of David
out in public." You know?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.057
And I, I didn't even
pay any attention to it, right?

05:24.157 --> 05:27.495
I didn't figure it was gonna
apply to us, to our generation.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.029
Yeah.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.131
Found that out the hard way
up in Gatling County.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.167
Yeah.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.470
I tried to find some
surveillance cams

05:36.570 --> 05:38.005
in the neighborhood, but, uh...

05:38.105 --> 05:39.573
this place, like, stopped dead
in time in the '80s.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.074
Nothing. What about you?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.943
Anything?
Forensics found
a spray paint can

05:43.043 --> 05:45.178
dropped by one of the
assailants, but no fingerprints.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.415
We're tracing the purchase,
but confidence isn't high.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.716
Brand's generic, it can be found

05:48.816 --> 05:50.618
in over a hundred stores
around the city.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.787
Hey, Dante, uh, I really
appreciate it, man.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.355
Thanks for coming down here.
It means a lot.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.090
Hate is everyone's problem.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.692
Yeah.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.297
Ah.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.433
Will you look at that.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.834
What a <i>shanda.</i>

06:06.934 --> 06:09.970
This mural told the story
of us coming to America

06:10.070 --> 06:12.606
to follow our dreams
of a better life.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.476
Oh, is that the friend
you were talking about?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.310
Yes. Harry is helping us.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.278
Uh, Harry.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.448
This is Rabbi Altman.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.549
Harry, is it?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.784
Yes, Rabbi.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.118
Uh, just wondering,
your last name?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.219
Keshegian.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.188
It's a Armenian
name, Keshegian.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.423
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.658
I have new hearing aids.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.092
Would you mind repeating that?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, it-it's Harry Keshegian.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.963
I knew it.
You're Sera's boy.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.232
You left us
just before your bar mitzvah.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.870
Yeah, yeah. My, uh, my dad
and I moved to Long Island

06:42.970 --> 06:44.137
after the divorce.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.939
I, you know, I didn't
see much of her.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.242
Your mother, should she rest
in peace, was a wonderful woman.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.744
She died too young.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.245
Yeah, so, um...

06:52.345 --> 06:54.848
have you seen
anything else alarming?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.550
Only online.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.752
We had to shut down
the comments section

06:58.852 --> 07:00.788
of the synagogue's website.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.390
If this is the digital age,
they can keep it.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.025
No, I hear you.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.393
Hey, do you think I might be
able to get access to that?

07:06.494 --> 07:07.928
'Cause I just want
to look over the comments

07:08.028 --> 07:10.297
and see if anything
sort of jumps out.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.665
If you really want to,
but I'm telling you,

07:11.765 --> 07:14.334
it's very,
very disgusting stuff.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.436
I understand.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.771
You're acting crazy!

07:17.871 --> 07:19.507
Maybe you
should leave!

07:19.607 --> 07:22.409
Leave? I'm not going anywhere
until you listen to me!

07:22.510 --> 07:24.244
Go! Now!

07:25.278 --> 07:28.716
Cheryl?
Cheryl McKenna.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.440
Please don't hurt us!
I'm not here

07:53.541 --> 07:54.975
to hurt you,
I'm here to help you.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.844
I'm Rebekah's friend.
Are you Cheryl?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.613
Yeah, and this
is my son, Wes.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.615
Could you please get that
out of my face now?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.717
It's not so fun when
it's pointing at you, is it?

08:04.918 --> 08:06.286
I'm sorry,

08:06.386 --> 08:07.788
Wes has just been
worried about me lately.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.390
It's why we were arguing
when you arrived.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.359
He thinks someone's
targeting me.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.327
Why do you think that?

08:19.567 --> 08:22.169
"Beware, you.
Jew lovers die too."

08:22.269 --> 08:24.304
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt you?

08:24.404 --> 08:25.773
No, I don't think so.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.608
The way this letter
references you... Yes.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.909
You see, I'm
not Jewish

08:29.009 --> 08:31.378
but I'm in the
process of converting.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.380
I... I love
the community.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.082
They took us in after
my husband died

08:35.182 --> 08:37.818
and everyone at Mitzi's
is like family to us.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.487
Sounds like
you found your people.
I did.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.389
And I don't want to leave
what I've built.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.792
First the letter,
then the deli attack.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.127
You need to leave.
How can we leave the community

08:47.227 --> 08:48.796
when they are at their lowest?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.064
Wes...

08:51.164 --> 08:52.766
I'm sorry.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.967
It's okay.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.502
Is there anything
that you remember,

08:55.603 --> 08:56.804
anything that stood out

08:56.904 --> 08:58.538
about the men who attacked you?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.741
It all happened so fast,
I didn't really see anything.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.976
Sorry I can't be more helpful.
It's okay.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.779
Is it all right if I take this?
It might lead to something.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.249
Of course. And I hope you
find who's ever doing this.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.351
We will.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.422
Okay.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.825
Dante's checking Cheryl's
letter for prints

09:17.925 --> 09:20.027
and he's seeing if he can
pull DNA off the envelope.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.394
So, Cheryl gets

09:21.494 --> 09:22.796
a threatening letter and
then two days later

09:22.896 --> 09:24.264
the deli that
she works at

09:24.364 --> 09:26.033
is vandalized and she's hurt.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.567
I mean, it's a clear escalation.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.202
That's interesting.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.370
What?

09:30.470 --> 09:31.504
Well, the font and the color
scheme--

09:31.605 --> 09:33.073
it looks like
comic book type.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.808
Gonna cross-reference it
with my comic book price guide.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.309
If it's been published
in the last 50 years

09:36.409 --> 09:37.544
it's gonna be in there.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.880
You have
a comic book pricing guide?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.715
Uh, yeah. I mean, how else
am I supposed to know

09:41.815 --> 09:43.684
the value of my comic books?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.285
Baby, we need
to get you out more.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.620
I don't know, babe.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.488
I've been perusing
the comments section

09:48.588 --> 09:50.323
on the synagogue's website--
check this out.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.325
I think I'd rather stay inside.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.594
Globalist. Really?
I mean, seriously.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.730
Jewish people are 0.2%
of the population.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.999
I mean, h-how...
We can't even decide on lunch,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.801
let alone world domination.
Yeah, I guess

10:00.901 --> 10:03.203
it's the conspiracy theory
that just keeps on giving.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.973
I mean, Taylor Swift
has more social media followers

10:06.073 --> 10:08.441
than there are Jewish people
on the face of the earth.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.712
Got something.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.049
All right, three comic books
with the same font and general

10:16.149 --> 10:19.286
color scheme of Cheryl's letter.
This one in particular

10:19.386 --> 10:23.290
looks to be an identical match.
It's, uh, called <i>Terror X.</i>

10:23.390 --> 10:24.858
The blurb says
that it's about

10:24.958 --> 10:26.426
an alien invasion
and the planet's

10:26.526 --> 10:28.228
struggle to survive.
Self-published,

10:28.328 --> 10:29.663
not sold in many stores.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.065
Wonder why they would use
a font from a comic book?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.734
It seems so random.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.904
There's this mom-and-pop shop
near Midwood-- they sell it.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.706
Maybe should go check
it out and just see

10:38.806 --> 10:40.140
who's purchasing the thing. Yeah.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.474
<i>I'm out here</i>

10:41.574 --> 10:43.010
doing everything I can
to protect Dee.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.845
Is that right?
Then why did Aunt Vi

10:44.945 --> 10:46.313
have to call me
to come rescue them

10:46.413 --> 10:47.647
from some
dirty bomb?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.516
That was an isolated incident,

10:49.616 --> 10:50.951
which has been taken care of.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.119
Taken care of how?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.954
The how does not matter.
What matters

10:54.054 --> 10:56.523
is at the end of the day,
everyone was safe.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.692
At what cost to Delilah?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.327
There have been measures
put in place to make sure

11:00.427 --> 11:02.763
that never happens again, Miles.
But you won't even

11:02.863 --> 11:04.464
tell me what these measures are.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.333
Delilah's being
all secretive,

11:06.433 --> 11:07.534
getting in fights at school.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.836
That's never
happened before.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.537
See, secrets like this
are exactly

11:10.637 --> 11:12.039
why we didn't work out.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.308
Look,

11:15.408 --> 11:16.844
we may not
have been a good fit,

11:16.944 --> 11:20.881
but, as parents...
we've always made a great team.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.150
Because we always made sure that

11:23.250 --> 11:25.152
Delilah's well-being came first.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.720
But now I'm starting
to wonder if this

11:26.820 --> 11:28.388
isn't all more about
you than it is her.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.058
Now you're accusing me
of ego. Okay, what happens

11:31.158 --> 11:33.160
if Dee comes to you?
Who's gonna be there for her?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
Because you're working
all the time, Miles,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.229
and so is Kelly.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.265
What are you
willing to sacrifice?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.400
Are you willing to quit your job
to raise her?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.435
I could ask you the same thing.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.237
Are you willing to quit doing...

11:44.337 --> 11:46.206
whatever the hell it is
you're doing?

11:51.812 --> 11:53.180
You're home early.
Everything okay?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.982
No, it's not.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.483
What's going on?

11:56.583 --> 11:58.986
When my friend Tracy's parents
were getting divorced,

11:59.086 --> 12:01.154
the judge asked her
who she'd choose to live with.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.689
And then they
went with her choice.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
That's good,
she had her say.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.727
No. No, she was forced
to choose between

12:07.828 --> 12:09.396
two people that she loved.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.565
And now you're placing me
in the exact same position.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.401
It's not fair.
I won't do it.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.502
Well, then don't do it.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.170
But I will not stand
by and watch

12:17.270 --> 12:19.807
you become collateral damage
of your mother's secret life.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.174
No, it's not her fault.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.675
Neither of you
are even listening to me.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.778
Dee, wait.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.014
Dee!

12:28.849 --> 12:31.351
Dee. You weren't
supposed to hear that.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.353
Okay, but I was.
That's the point.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.754
I should have a say in this,

12:34.855 --> 12:36.289
and I don't want
anything to change.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.490
And it won't.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.859
You keep saying that,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.493
but dad seems pretty determined.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.995
And you can't blame him.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.496
What do you mean?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.332
Dad is right.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.768
I am probably safer living there
than I am here.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.271
What you do
is so important.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.874
What worries me more is...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.878
What worries me more
is that Dad could expose you.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.047
That is my burden to bear,
not yours.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.349
No, no, it is mine,
and I have thought long

13:02.449 --> 13:04.284
and hard
about this.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.587
I think I should
go live with dad.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.825
That what you wanted
all this time?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.861
No.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.029
But what you do is
too important, Mom.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.031
You can't
be exposed.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.101
Living with Dad
is how I protect you.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.120
Miles, please don't do this.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.889
You know, and here I thought
we were gonna actually

13:41.989 --> 13:44.091
have a real discussion
about this.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.526
But that's not what today
was about for you, was it?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.162
You know, I'm out.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.263
Wait!

14:00.407 --> 14:01.942
Man.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.447
Nothing like the smell
of comic books in the morning.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.249
Yeah, it smells like mildew.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.717
Exactly.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.852
Hiya.
Hey.
Hi.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.121
How can I help
you folks today?

14:14.221 --> 14:17.757
Uh, wondering
if you sell <i>Terror X.</i>

14:17.857 --> 14:20.360
Sell, no.
Have, yes.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.861
Sales did me no favors,
so I'm currently

14:21.962 --> 14:23.230
using them as coasters.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.865
All right. Uh, well,
have you sold any? Or...

14:25.966 --> 14:27.367
A few here and there.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.469
Has anyone been
into the book enough

14:29.569 --> 14:31.138
to put it on their pull list?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.405
Why do you ask?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.640
Uh, someone's

14:33.740 --> 14:35.108
been using
cut-up pages

14:35.208 --> 14:37.477
from <i>Terror X</i> to spread hate
in the community.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.479
As someone who's got
a history of genocide

14:39.579 --> 14:41.281
on both sides of my family,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.450
just want to be a good citizen,
nip it in the bud.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.919
A list of names and emails
would really help us out.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.389
Um, sorry, privacy
for my customers is important.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.325
The comic book store business
is rough.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
And with the Internet,
most people just

14:54.127 --> 14:55.862
order their
comics online.
Totally, yeah.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.565
Donation.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.735
But helping the community
is always priority number one.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.704
Thank you.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.740
Oh. Please tell me
you weren't one of those

15:07.840 --> 15:10.910
<i>Dungeons Dragons</i> guys.
Hells no, woman.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.680
Much more a <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>
type of dude.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.115
You purposely hid that chapter

15:15.215 --> 15:16.483
of your life from me,
didn't you?

15:16.583 --> 15:20.453
A planeswalker
never reveals his secrets.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.957
Free with every donation. Ah.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.193
Yeah, sorry about the
coffee stains. Like I said,

15:26.293 --> 15:27.560
they make good coasters.
No problem.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.661
Thank you.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.929
Thank you so much. Sure.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.100
So, that name you got from
the comic book guy's list

15:33.200 --> 15:35.902
and the synagogue hate post,
aka Skinhead Steve--

15:36.003 --> 15:37.971
his real name
is Steven Ray Bailey.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.906
Sending you
his police record now.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.975
So, what's his deal besides,

15:42.075 --> 15:44.111
you know, the Nazi
of it all?

15:44.211 --> 15:47.147
A few misdemeanors, a DUI,
some unpaid parking tickets.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.749
Ooh, and a love
of roller skating.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.751
I'll spare you his
skate for hate videos.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.586
Okay, so, this Steve

15:53.686 --> 15:55.488
posts anti-Semitic remarks

15:55.588 --> 15:58.891
on the synagogue board
he is a fan of <i>Terror X.</i>

15:58.992 --> 16:00.360
What the hell else is he up to?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.828
We got him in the box.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.396
We're about to find out.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.399
You know what I say to
the Zionist occupied government?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.036
Jews will not replace us.
They can't stop us.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.304
We're an army.
And we will not stop until

16:11.404 --> 16:12.972
we secure the existence
of our people

16:13.073 --> 16:15.908
and a future for white children.
White power!

16:31.691 --> 16:33.526
"Better run, Jew"?

16:33.626 --> 16:36.063
Hey!
Oh, lookie here.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.300
Get away from me.
Stop it. Get out of... No!

16:40.400 --> 16:42.635
Give that back!
Stop! Someone, help!
You won't replace us.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.371
Take that!

16:45.338 --> 16:46.873
How's that feel?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.748
What an unbelievable
piece of crap.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.550
It's a metaphor for the Jews.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.487
And not a good one.
Alien invasion comes to Earth,

17:00.587 --> 17:04.624
blood sacrifices, mind control.
No wonder Skinhead
Steve loved it.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.260
Who wrote it?
I looked him up.
Brian Augie Hunter.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.928
I couldn't
find anything, though.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.430
It's clearly a pseudonym.
Did you call Kent?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.565
Mm-hmm.
He have any leads on the guy?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.101
He knows the guy
by the same name. He said

17:14.201 --> 17:15.768
he came in to the shop
a few months ago, begged him

17:15.868 --> 17:17.504
to sell it,
hasn't seen him since.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.274
It's McCall. Hey.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.842
Hey.
Just checking in.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.178
Yeah, I heard back from Dante.
It turns out our lead,

17:25.278 --> 17:28.215
Steve, alibied out for
the night of Cheryl's attack.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.583
Car rental,
airfare, hotel,

17:30.683 --> 17:32.685
all point to
an Aryan Brotherhood conference

17:32.785 --> 17:34.287
he went to in Indianapolis.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.489
Have you heard back about
the other anti-Semitic crimes

17:36.589 --> 17:38.558
that took place in Midwood?
Any pattern there?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.793
Dante's police report says
that all the incidents

17:40.893 --> 17:42.662
happened within
a few blocks of each other,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.697
but that they're not
necessarily related.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.300
But some of the incidents
do have specific time stamps.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.668
These guys aren't geniuses.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.203
They likely
had their phones with them.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.071
Maybe if we get lucky
we trace one of the numbers

17:52.172 --> 17:53.573
across various locations

17:53.673 --> 17:55.542
and times of the attacks.
I'll run a search.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.145
It may take a while,
but it'll be worth it.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.546
Rob, how's it going on your end?

17:59.646 --> 18:02.449
Right now, a little complicated.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.219
I'll let you know
how it all plays out.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.489
You got it.
We're here if you need anything.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.634
Hey.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.203
Wh... Rebekah,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.071
uh, slow-slow down.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.473
W-What happened?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.846
Rabbi, I came as
soon as I heard.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.448
You all right?
Keshegian.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.285
Twice in one day. Someone up
there must really like me.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.788
Rabbi, can you remember
anything about your attackers?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.723
A tattoo,
a watch, shoes--

18:43.823 --> 18:45.525
a-anything like that
can be really helpful.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.894
Uh, they were all in black,

18:47.994 --> 18:49.696
uh, ski masks.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.130
One of them, I think,

18:51.231 --> 18:52.365
was holding up a phone?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.766
Like they were recording you?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.202
Recording?
What do you... Why?

18:55.302 --> 18:57.670
Uh, not unless they mistook me
for Brad Pitt.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.539
Rabbi, uh,

18:59.639 --> 19:00.973
you-you want to get
these guys, right?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.074
Boychik,

19:02.175 --> 19:03.910
you have a good heart.
Your mother--

19:04.010 --> 19:05.945
she should rest in peace--
she had a good heart, too.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.248
She was always
trying to help o...
These men,

19:08.348 --> 19:10.917
today, that attacked you--
they-they could have killed you.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.953
Well, i-it's like how
every Jewish holiday started.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.290
They tried to kill us.
We won. Let's eat.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.226
Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't know

19:19.326 --> 19:22.061
how you can be laughing
at a time like this.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.932
Do you know
what your Hebrew name is?

19:26.032 --> 19:27.734
N... No.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.803
It's Itzhak.
It means laughter.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.005
You can't lose your joy, Harry.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.542
If you let them
crush your spirit,

19:35.642 --> 19:36.876
they win.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.044
I'll try and keep that in mind.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.613
Good.
And I'll-I'll see you

19:40.713 --> 19:42.482
in the morning at services?

19:42.582 --> 19:43.950
Hey, Rabbi, I don't know
what kind of drugs

19:44.050 --> 19:45.452
they're giving you here,
but you're in no condition

19:45.552 --> 19:47.320
to be conducting services.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.689
Well... our greatest glory

19:49.789 --> 19:52.625
is not in never having fallen

19:52.725 --> 19:55.262
but in rising
every time we fall.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.096
That was from the Torah?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.498
Confucius.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.768
Listen, Rabbi, I'm
gonna find the people

20:01.868 --> 20:03.736
responsible for
doing this to you,

20:03.836 --> 20:05.505
and when I do,

20:05.605 --> 20:07.240
they're gonna pay.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.146
Honey garlic chicken?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.616
Yep.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.951
I got your
mashed potatoes, too.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.387
Everything okay?

20:20.487 --> 20:21.754
Everything's fine.
Why?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.089
'Cause you never cook.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.392
That's because
I never have time.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.794
What happened with Miles?

20:28.595 --> 20:30.029
All good.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.465
You used the file, didn't you?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.133
No.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.537
Miles is Delilah's father

20:37.637 --> 20:39.238
and she loves him.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.609
He's not the enemy, he's family.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.677
I've just put them both
in an impossible position.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.413
I just can't do that anymore.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.516
So, what changed
his mind?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.284
Nothing.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.086
Just won't be
equalizing anymore.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.289
No.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.391
No.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.360
You are not quitting over this.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.462
Miles is wrong.
Is he?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.763
Because of my work,

21:03.863 --> 21:07.066
my child thinks
she needs to protect me.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.035
I'm out here telling
myself that I'm creating

21:09.135 --> 21:11.604
a safer world for my daughter,
that I'm setting

21:11.704 --> 21:13.806
injustice right,
that I'm being a voice

21:13.906 --> 21:15.708
for the voiceless.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.611
But what does
any of that matter

21:18.711 --> 21:22.482
if doing all of that
makes me lose Dee?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.551
This is what I have to do

21:24.651 --> 21:27.153
to keep her here with me.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.823
And you've told him all this?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.492
I'm going by tomorrow
and tell him that everything

21:32.592 --> 21:36.963
going on with me is over.
I'm officially retired.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.705
Just haven't figured out
how to tell Harry and Mel yet.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.382
Did you get anything?
Mm. Mm-mmm.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.585
Okay.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.119
What's going on?
You've been off

22:00.219 --> 22:02.855
since the hospital.
Talk to me.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.526
You know, the rabbi
keeps talking about my mom

22:06.626 --> 22:09.862
like she was this perfect
specimen of a human being.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.498
Not the mom I grew up with.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.733
It's just...
What kind of mother

22:13.833 --> 22:16.035
abandons their kid?
Y-You know

22:16.135 --> 22:19.038
she didn't even fight for me
when my parents split up.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.542
Oh, hey.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.210
We got a hit on that tower.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.879
Three numbers were present
across the hate crime locations

22:26.979 --> 22:28.180
at the time that they occurred,

22:28.280 --> 22:31.584
including Cheryl's attack
and the rabbi's.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.152
Who do they belong to?

22:33.252 --> 22:35.922
I can't ID them because
the phones were all burners.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.557
But the GPS on one of them

22:37.657 --> 22:39.959
is currently active
and it's tracking to a location

22:40.059 --> 22:42.895
on Jefferson in Bushwick.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.897
All right, let's go.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.474
Are you sure this is the place?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.909
Well, I mean, it's where the GPS

22:57.009 --> 22:59.311
on the burner phone took us.

23:01.448 --> 23:04.350
Uh, is it my imagination
or are the dudes

23:04.451 --> 23:07.887
at this place, like,
really checking you out?

23:07.987 --> 23:09.221
Am I detecting jealousy?
Jealousy,

23:09.321 --> 23:11.257
anxiety, massive insecurity.
The ushe.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.993
All right,
he's got to be here somewhere.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.062
I'm calling the number.
Keep your eyes peeled

23:16.162 --> 23:17.830
for anyone
who answers their phone.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.543
Think we should get the check.
Okay, hold on.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
I got him.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.701
Wes?

23:54.801 --> 23:56.068
You know
this guy?

23:56.168 --> 23:59.171
Yeah, he's Cheryl's son.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.515
Last I checked,
listening to live music

24:08.615 --> 24:10.282
doesn't make me a criminal.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.818
You're right.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.487
But beating up
a defenseless old man does.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.558
This yours?

24:21.427 --> 24:23.530
I don't get it.
He's got all these videos

24:23.630 --> 24:24.864
on his phone, right?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.232
But he didn't
upload them anywhere.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.567
He just sent them
to a burner phone

24:27.667 --> 24:29.135
that wasn't
at any of the attacks.
My money

24:29.235 --> 24:31.538
is on someone behind the scenes
pulling the strings.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.239
The old Manson move.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.174
Those videos
exist online somewhere.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.643
Problem is those things
are everywhere.

24:36.743 --> 24:37.810
I'll run a search
but it'll be like

24:37.910 --> 24:40.246
looking for a needle
in a hatestack.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.248
And let me guess--
it was you who sent

24:42.348 --> 24:43.315
those nice letters, too.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.884
But what I can't
figure out

24:44.984 --> 24:46.485
is why would you
target your own mother.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.320
She wasn't supposed
to be working that night.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.789
And the letter?
It was meant

24:49.889 --> 24:52.124
to scare her. She needs
to get away from Midwood.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.562
Away from a community that
has been there for both of you. Yeah.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.631
Waiting on them hand and foot,
like a servant.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.370
She can't see
what they are yet, but I can.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.205
My eyes have been opened.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.540
Is that right?

25:07.640 --> 25:09.241
And who opened them?
They have

25:09.341 --> 25:10.810
any more big plans?

25:11.611 --> 25:14.581
<i>I just can't believe
Wes is down with all of this.</i>

25:14.681 --> 25:16.348
He's college-educated,
he's got

25:16.448 --> 25:17.650
a loving mom. He just...

25:17.750 --> 25:19.619
he doesn't fit the typical mold.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.821
Well, welcome
to the new face of hate.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.856
It's not swastikas
and white hoods

25:23.956 --> 25:27.059
<i>anymore, it's the guy
at the grocery store, it's</i>

25:27.159 --> 25:29.796
the mailman.
Meaning you never
see them coming.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.031
Maybe a few days
in a holding cell

25:32.131 --> 25:34.500
will change your mind
about talking.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.636
Let's go.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.408
Jew gonna be sorry.

25:42.508 --> 25:43.843
What was that?

25:43.943 --> 25:45.411
Jew gonna be sorry.

25:45.511 --> 25:46.913
Hey, hey!
Harry, please!

25:47.013 --> 25:48.681
Harry, honey.
Say it again!
Get him out of here!

25:48.781 --> 25:50.482
Stop it, please.
Come on, stop, stop.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.620
You could face assault charges.
I could be suspended

25:53.720 --> 25:55.154
for letting a civilian
into a restricted area.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.524
What would you do?
What do you think I'd do?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.828
Go home.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.997
I'll be in touch.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.401
Yes.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.071
Ah. Come in.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.442
So, why the urgency?

26:16.542 --> 26:17.844
Is Dee okay?

26:17.944 --> 26:20.379
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she's...

26:20.479 --> 26:22.548
she's fine. I...

26:22.649 --> 26:25.785
I wanted to talk about
you and Robyn.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.790
Aunt Vi,
with all due respect,

26:30.890 --> 26:33.660
I'll say what I have to say
to the judge on Monday.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.696
You're a good father, Miles.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.530
But Robyn is also a good mother.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.566
This isn't about Robyn.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.835
It's never been about Robyn.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.538
All I'm trying to do
is protect my daughter.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.875
And I'm sure you believe that.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.991
Why are you showing me this?

27:05.091 --> 27:07.026
Because I want you to see
the kind of person Robyn is.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.560
She could have told
the entire world that

27:08.661 --> 27:10.262
while you were
working overseas

27:10.362 --> 27:12.331
that you saved the life of

27:12.431 --> 27:14.533
a known terrorist.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.602
A man who went on to kill

27:16.703 --> 27:18.537
hundreds of people.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.972
I took an oath.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.141
I don't get to pick
and choose who I treat

27:22.241 --> 27:24.777
and I sure as hell
don't get to play at being God.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.880
That may be true, but
public perception is everything.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.582
Robyn could have used that
information to make sure

27:30.683 --> 27:33.219
that you never
got custody of Delilah.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.687
But she won't bring down

27:34.787 --> 27:36.422
the father of her child
that way.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.057
That's who she is.
It doesn't

27:38.157 --> 27:41.093
change the fact that she's
putting our daughter in danger

27:41.193 --> 27:43.329
by doing whatever
it is she's doing.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.697
Robyn is out there saving lives.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.199
Not that different
from you, Miles.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.868
And that dirty bomb situation?

27:48.968 --> 27:51.137
Do you know how many people
would have died

27:51.237 --> 27:53.039
if Robyn wasn't there?

27:53.139 --> 27:55.107
That's just facts.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.109
And now she's gonna
give all of that up because

27:57.209 --> 28:00.747
you are accusing her
of being a bad mother?

28:00.847 --> 28:03.015
I am telling you,
the world cannot afford

28:03.115 --> 28:06.218
to lose Robyn,
and neither can Dee.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.058
Maybe Robyn won't come for you.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.261
But I sure as hell will.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.330
And while she's out there

28:18.430 --> 28:21.000
saving the world...

28:21.100 --> 28:23.002
who's making sure
my daughter is safe?

28:23.102 --> 28:24.270
Me.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.505
I'm the backstop.
I'm the one

28:26.605 --> 28:28.640
always watching over her.

28:28.741 --> 28:32.444
She's not just your child,
she is my child too.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.247
Delilah's thriving.
She's not thriving

28:35.347 --> 28:36.615
in spite of her circumstances,

28:36.715 --> 28:39.651
she's thriving because of them.

28:39.752 --> 28:42.388
She's blossoming into this...

28:42.488 --> 28:45.224
powerful young woman.

28:48.327 --> 28:52.298
And I will not let you
take that away from her.

29:06.145 --> 29:09.681
Heard about what happened
at the precinct. He okay?

29:09.782 --> 29:11.150
He's a wreck.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.085
He's been up all night.
He's scared

29:13.185 --> 29:15.287
of failing. He's scared
of letting people down.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.023
Yeah, I get that.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.826
How you doing?

29:19.926 --> 29:22.261
I mean, it's hard
to see him struggle like this.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.563
A lot of history comes along

29:24.663 --> 29:27.266
with this one for him, you know?

29:53.559 --> 29:54.560
<i>Anyway,</i>

29:54.660 --> 29:57.129
how'd it go with Miles?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.165
That's the other
reason I'm here.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.804
I have had to take, um...
a hard look at my future.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.207
What we do,
people we help.

30:09.041 --> 30:12.278
What it means, day-to-day,
to be Dee's mom.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.682
And...

30:22.488 --> 30:24.523
Oh. Hey, Harry.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.792
Mel, I found something. I
need you to come down here now.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.094
Okay.
Coming right down.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.595
We'll finish talking later.
Come on.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.330
Yeah.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.233
Hey.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.468
Mel. Hey.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.569
Oh, hey, Rob.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.906
Good.
Okay, check this out. So,

30:40.006 --> 30:42.141
I'm staring at these clues
all night long,

30:42.241 --> 30:44.276
trying to figure out if there's
just something we're not seeing,

30:44.376 --> 30:47.546
right? You know, and then
a pattern begins to emerge.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.448
A secret code.
Check it out.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.783
B.U.E. Okay?

30:51.884 --> 30:54.220
Now watch this. B.U.E.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.388
Look at this one. B.U.E.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.689
And last but not least,

30:57.789 --> 30:59.158
B.U.E.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.527
It's in the <i>Terror X</i>
writer's name.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.162
So, what's the code for?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.997
I don't know.
But it's something that

31:05.097 --> 31:06.732
these guys use
to hide in plain sight.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.968
It's like a Bat-Signal
for bed-wetters.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.102
Wait a minute,
you know what else

31:10.202 --> 31:11.503
has B.U.E. in it-- the name

31:11.603 --> 31:12.771
of the comic book store.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.075
Right?
It's "Bam. Buff. Kerplop."

31:16.175 --> 31:18.444
And it's the only store
that sells <i>Terror X.</i>

31:18.544 --> 31:21.247
Kent?!
Yeah. It can't be
a coincidence, right?

31:21.347 --> 31:22.581
He's got to be involved.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.816
Yeah, you're right. He does.
You know what?

31:24.917 --> 31:26.152
I'm gonna go have a
little chat with Kent.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.187
Oh, wait, no.
Babe, you have to stay here.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.755
You got to figure out
what this code means.

31:29.855 --> 31:30.990
It could be the key
to this everything.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.124
Yeah, and lead you
straight to them.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.659
I will go
to the comic book store,

31:33.759 --> 31:35.661
I'll see what else
Kent is hiding.
Uh-huh.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.229
Will you please
go down there with her?

31:37.329 --> 31:40.232
Just in case something
isn't kosher. No pun intended.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.003
Of course.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.954
Seems Kent
is a card-carrying Nazi.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.424
And he's the author
of <i>Terror X.</i>

32:05.524 --> 32:07.793
Because of course he is.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.400
<i>"Blut und Ehre."</i>

32:14.500 --> 32:15.734
B.U.E.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.636
Means "blood and honor"
in German.

32:17.736 --> 32:18.937
<i>Blut und Ehre--</i>

32:19.038 --> 32:20.639
that's a Nazi political slogan.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.108
The Hitler Youth used to say it.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.410
All right, all right,
hold up, I got an idea.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.478
Um... I got it.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.547
This is where they've been
uploading all their attacks.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.582
Oh, man.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.384
You guys.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.054
Something really bad is
about to happen in 15 minutes.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.755
Another attack?

32:36.855 --> 32:38.190
Where?
Saturday morning.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.926
There's only one place
people go in Midwood.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.556
Good Shabbas. And, for
our younger congregants,

33:10.656 --> 33:13.259
Shabbat Shalom.
Shabbat Shalom.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.194
Well, as you can all see,
I-I partied

33:15.294 --> 33:17.496
a little too hardy last night.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.666
What are you gonna do?

33:20.766 --> 33:24.170
Well, we'll get through this
together, shall we?

33:25.904 --> 33:27.906
Damn it.
No one's answering.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.046
Less than two minutes.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.547
Livestream's up.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.349
We're still five minutes out.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.684
Dante called for backup
but they're

33:38.784 --> 33:40.219
not gonna make it in time.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.225
Okay. I know it's been a while--

33:46.325 --> 33:48.094
all right, maybe never--

33:48.194 --> 33:50.396
but... if you can hear me,

33:50.496 --> 33:53.132
just give me something.
Just anything.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.138
Wow.
Ask and ye shall receive.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.175
Please let this work.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.776
Time!

34:04.876 --> 34:07.045
Today we show the world
the path to purification.

34:07.146 --> 34:10.349
Yeah, all right.
We show the fallen our power.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.285
Gentlemen, today
you meet your destiny

34:13.385 --> 34:16.122
and forevermore shall be written
into the history books

34:16.222 --> 34:17.689
as heroes

34:17.789 --> 34:20.058
and legends! White power!
Yeah! Let's do it!

34:20.159 --> 34:23.962
White Power!
White power! White power!

34:24.062 --> 34:26.732
Revolution starts today.

34:58.497 --> 34:59.965
Where are they?

35:00.065 --> 35:02.534
The vermin must be here.
Find them.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.069
Check upstairs.

35:04.170 --> 35:06.305
They're hiding.
That's what vermin do--

35:06.405 --> 35:10.108
hide, spread disease,
steal your food and money.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.714
Shh.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.049
Found them. They're in here.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.653
Shh.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.527
Aah!

35:30.662 --> 35:32.564
What the hell?
What was that?

35:32.664 --> 35:33.999
See anyone?
What's up there?

35:34.099 --> 35:36.335
Hey, hey, who's up there?
Show yourself!

35:36.435 --> 35:37.869
Aah!

35:41.473 --> 35:44.910
Holy crap.
He's freakin' dead!

36:08.700 --> 36:10.669
Now you're just showing off.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.473
Some brave soldiers
were lost today.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.007
But this is the price
of victory.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.643
Patience is a virtue,
my friends,

36:17.743 --> 36:19.044
and we shall prevail!

36:24.816 --> 36:26.452
Hey, dude, you know what?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.654
You're not only a bad Nazi.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.121
You're a garbage writer.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.957
Just terrible.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.926
And you guys.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.629
So, I hacked into your
Nazi clown show website,

36:37.729 --> 36:39.164
and you're no longer anonymous.

36:39.265 --> 36:42.067
So, uh, your employers,
uh, loved ones,

36:42.167 --> 36:43.902
local officials,
have all been notified.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.805
Uh, guess that's it.
Good Shabbas, uh, and remember,

36:46.905 --> 36:50.509
we may be few, but David
slays Goliath every time.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.043
All right.
You take care, now.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.678
When I heard your voice
in my hearing aid

37:26.778 --> 37:29.515
I-I thought maybe it was
the voice of God

37:29.615 --> 37:31.182
actually talking
to me.

37:31.283 --> 37:34.052
But I'm glad it was you instead.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.187
Thank you.
Of course.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.389
How did you do it?

37:37.489 --> 37:39.591
Well, when we met,
you-you told me

37:39.691 --> 37:40.726
you were having
problems with them,

37:40.826 --> 37:42.628
and I realized later that, uh,

37:42.728 --> 37:44.129
they ran on Bluetooth,

37:44.229 --> 37:46.332
so I-I hacked into them
through your cell phone.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.967
Maybe, the digital age
is not so bad.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.169
Mm.
I'm proud of
you, Keshegian.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.705
Your mother would have
been proud of you too.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.608
I'm-I'm...
I'm glad that you have

37:56.708 --> 37:59.010
such fond memories of my mom.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.647
But, uh...
I ca-I can't say the same

38:01.747 --> 38:04.249
about a woman who abandoned me

38:04.350 --> 38:05.751
the way that she did.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.721
Of course.
You don't know, do you?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.590
I don't know what?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.725
Your mother--
she-she suffered from

38:13.825 --> 38:15.827
horrible bouts of depression.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.797
It was to the synagogue
that she came, and it...

38:18.897 --> 38:21.333
it helped. But she felt

38:21.433 --> 38:23.034
she couldn't help you,

38:23.134 --> 38:25.604
and so she set you free

38:25.704 --> 38:27.339
so you
could thrive.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.274
But wh... Okay.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.943
Well, then why didn't my father
tell me any of this?

38:32.043 --> 38:34.713
Because your mother
made him swear he wouldn't.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.484
She was ashamed.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.621
'Cause mental illness wasn't
talked about much back then.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.055
It still isn't.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.324
And your father
loved your mother very much.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.794
He would have done
anything for her.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.929
But he didn't know
how to help her.

38:51.029 --> 38:55.200
So he decided to
help you instead.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.804
And look what a mensch
you've turned into.

38:58.904 --> 39:01.407
Because you were born
out of love.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.655
Hey, you guys,
I don't know

39:16.755 --> 39:19.190
how I'll ever be
able to repay you.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.794
And, uh, I'm really sorry about
losing it at the station.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.663
Eh, believe me,
I've been there.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.002
Everything okay?

39:32.170 --> 39:34.940
Actually, yeah.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.008
Never better.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.514
That was some long talk
you had with Harry and Mel.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.750
How'd it go?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.685
Actually, good news.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.353
Miles is dropping
his petition for custody.

39:48.454 --> 39:52.123
I knew that man would come to
his senses sooner or later.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.195
Yeah.

40:00.065 --> 40:03.168
I just wonder
what made him change his mind.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.706
The thought of being fully
responsible for a teenage girl

40:07.806 --> 40:10.075
probably scared
some sense into him.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.810
So,

40:11.910 --> 40:14.112
what does this mean for you now?

40:15.614 --> 40:18.650
Well, it means I get to
continue helping people.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.488
Just need to find a better
balance between work and family.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.390
Balance is good, grasshopper.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.526
I know this.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.862
Everything I've done
up until to now...

40:30.962 --> 40:33.198
I could not have
done without you.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.334
I know.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.303
Thank you.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.374
Hey.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.443
Hey.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.746
Good news.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.081
Me and your dad worked it out.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.918
And?

40:53.018 --> 40:55.420
You're staying right here
where you belong.

40:55.521 --> 40:56.888
And you still
get to help people?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.924
And protect you.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.226
But listen, I realized

41:01.326 --> 41:04.262
as much as I always
want to be here for you,

41:04.362 --> 41:05.831
one day I won't.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.534
So, what about

41:08.634 --> 41:10.168
we spend some time
training together?

41:10.268 --> 41:12.638
And I'm not just
talking about fighting.

41:12.738 --> 41:16.174
I can show you how
to read people, situations.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.209
How to use your environment
to your advantage.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.345
So that one day
the only weapon you'll need

41:20.445 --> 41:21.647
is yourself.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.582
For real?

41:38.229 --> 41:39.297
Man.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.066
Could have saved
a ton on therapy

41:41.166 --> 41:44.035
if I had known about my
mother all these years.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.371
Well, I'm glad you know now. Yeah.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.609
You know, it's fitting that your
Jewish name is Itzhak.

41:50.709 --> 41:54.179
Because, uh, your sense of humor
is why I fell in love with you.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.614
Really?
Mm-hmm.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.916
And here I thought it was
my fabulous head of hair.

41:58.016 --> 42:01.019
Well, that didn't hurt.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.827
Uh, so, I've never
done this before.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.697
But, um, I saw my mom

42:11.797 --> 42:13.464
do this for my grandmother.

42:14.399 --> 42:17.335
This is how the Jewish people

42:17.435 --> 42:19.304
honor their dead.

42:19.404 --> 42:21.973
Make sure that
their memory lives on,

42:22.073 --> 42:23.909
burns bright.

42:28.113 --> 42:30.716
I was just so mad at my mom.

42:30.816 --> 42:33.418
I just...

42:33.518 --> 42:35.386
I never honored her

42:35.486 --> 42:38.356
or my people.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.460
This is for you, mom.
