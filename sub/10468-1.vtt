WEBVTT

00:02.177 --> 00:04.326
CAREFUL WITH CUPID
THERE, BUDDY, HE'S BREAKABLE.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.726
BAILEY, WHEN DID WE SUDDENLY
SWITCH LOCATIONS?

00:06.782 --> 00:08.749
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING THIS
AT THOSE PRESIDIO GARDENS.

00:08.797 --> 00:11.008
YESTERDAY A FRIEND OF MINE
FROM THE PRESERVATION SOCIETY

00:11.046 --> 00:12.426
CALLED, SAID
THIS PLACE WAS AVAILABLE.

00:12.475 --> 00:13.951
JULE, WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THIS THEATER.

00:13.995 --> 00:16.542
GOLD LEAF CEILINGS,
WALL MOSAICS--

00:16.593 --> 00:18.562
THE KEYSMANS. DIDN'T I READ THEY
WERE GUTTING THIS PLACE AND SELLING IT?

00:18.610 --> 00:20.630
THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART.
YES, BUT NOT FOR 2 WEEKS.

00:20.655 --> 00:22.165
WHICH IS WHY I GOT
SUCH A GREAT PRICE.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.027
THIS THING WEIGHS A TON. WHAT IS THIS FOR?

00:24.057 --> 00:26.033
IT'S A BURMESE FLOWER TOWER.
IT'S FOR THE ALTAR.

00:26.077 --> 00:28.152
IT REPRESENTS THE STAGES
OF ROMANTIC LOVE.

00:28.928 --> 00:30.600
ESTEEM, AFFECTION,
COMMITMENT--

00:30.625 --> 00:31.951
OK, YEAH, I'M SURE,
BUT DOES THIS

00:31.997 --> 00:33.037
MINISTER KNOW HOW
TO FIND THIS PLACE?

00:33.087 --> 00:34.948
NO MINISTER, CLAUD. THIS
ISN'T THE ACTUAL REHEARSAL.

00:34.984 --> 00:36.058
IT'S JUST A TECH.

00:37.476 --> 00:40.320
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
THE ETERNITY MOTIFS,

00:40.365 --> 00:41.346
CAN WE LOAD
THOSE IN LAST?

00:41.671 --> 00:42.710
THANKS.

00:45.494 --> 00:47.107
BAILEY...

00:47.140 --> 00:48.953
WHY ARE WE WAITING?
DON'T YOU HAVE A KEY?

00:49.012 --> 00:51.123
YES.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.306
I'VE CALLED SECURITY, AND
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. OK.

00:55.294 --> 00:56.603
EXCUSE ME.

00:57.295 --> 00:58.827
NO ONE SAID
THIS WAS A THEATER.

00:58.864 --> 01:00.595
I CANNOT RELEASE MY DOVES IN A THEATER.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.542
THEY'LL SHOOT RIGHT UP
INTO THE FLIES AND BE GONE FOREVER.

01:02.569 --> 01:05.295
BUT I NEED THEM TO SOAR
WHEN MY COUPLE ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.647
CAN'T YOU... TIE WEIGHTS
TO THEM OR SOMETHING?

01:09.913 --> 01:11.748
Security Guard: WHICH
ONE'S BAILEY SALINGER?

01:12.054 --> 01:13.170
YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

01:13.535 --> 01:17.156
CAN YOU OPEN THIS DOOR
FOR ME, PLEASE? MY KEY WOULDN'T WORK.

01:17.216 --> 01:18.476
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO RENTED THE PLACE

01:18.501 --> 01:19.862
-FOR THIS WEEKEND?
-YES.

01:19.887 --> 01:21.237
AND NO ONE
CALLED YOU?

01:22.080 --> 01:23.545
CALLED ME.
WHY?

01:25.022 --> 01:26.657
PURCHASE INSPECTION
YESTERDAY

01:26.707 --> 01:28.617
TURNED UP SOME
FOUNDATION CRACKS,

01:28.664 --> 01:30.256
SO THE CITY,
THEY SEALED IT OFF.

01:30.617 --> 01:32.731
NO ONE'S ALLOWED INSIDE
UNTIL IT'S BEEN SHORED UP.

01:32.781 --> 01:34.364
IT'S GONNA BE A COUPLA MONTHS AT LEAST.

01:34.388 --> 01:36.385
BUT I JUST TALKED
TO HELEN LAST NIGHT,

01:36.422 --> 01:37.496
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY
A WORD ABOUT THIS.

01:37.541 --> 01:39.763
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT MY AREA, SIR. I'M SORRY.

01:40.485 --> 01:41.759
I-I'M REALLY SORRY.

01:44.385 --> 01:47.857
OH, WAIT. THIS IS A
NIGHTMARE. THE WEDDING IS 4 DAYS AWAY,

01:47.891 --> 01:50.380
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, X
JUST, LIKE, HAVE IT HERE IN THIS ALLEY?

01:50.623 --> 01:53.256
4 DAYS IS PLENTY OF TIME, CLAUD.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO...

01:53.333 --> 01:54.820
IF WE PUT OUR
HEADS TOGETHER--

01:54.895 --> 01:57.365
WE'LL JUST--
WE CAN, UM...

01:57.407 --> 01:59.554
-WE'LL HAVE IT--WE'LL DO IT--
-AT HOME.

01:59.579 --> 02:00.767
-YEAH. AT HOME. AT THE HOUSE.
-YEAH.

02:00.798 --> 02:02.673
RIGHT. IN THE BACKYARD. IT'S PERFECT.

02:02.711 --> 02:03.808
YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

02:03.852 --> 02:06.577
EXCUSE ME.
NO, WE WILL NOT.

02:06.607 --> 02:09.157
THEY WILL NOT GET MARRIED IN
THAT BACKYARD BECAUSE

02:09.245 --> 02:11.282
FIRST OF ALL, THAT BACKYARD IS ROTTEN LUCK

02:11.307 --> 02:13.002
FOR WEDDINGS
CHARLIE, JULIA,

02:13.061 --> 02:15.361
AM I RIGHT--
AND SECOND OF ALL,

02:15.730 --> 02:18.020
HOPEFULLY, THIS IS THE LAST WEDDING YOU

02:18.045 --> 02:20.375
ARE EVER GOING TO NEED,
AND IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS,

02:20.439 --> 02:21.891
ISN'T THAT
HOW IT SHOULD FEEL?

02:24.768 --> 02:26.076
Charlie: YES.

02:26.884 --> 02:27.973
HOW?

02:28.533 --> 02:29.922
YOU LEAVE THAT
TO ME.

02:30.857 --> 02:33.477
OK. LET'S GO, PEOPLE.
WE'RE ON THE MOVE.

03:10.810 --> 03:12.029
DID THEY
SAY SOMETHING?

03:12.054 --> 03:14.430
NO. I MEAN,
NOTHING NEW.

03:14.938 --> 03:17.655
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW HE'S FELT SINCE I GOT SICK.

03:17.722 --> 03:19.273
YEAH, BUT
THAT WAS 3 YEARS AGO.

03:19.318 --> 03:21.684
RIGHT. HE KNOWS THAT. AND HE
PROMISED HE WOULDN'T BRING IT UP.

03:21.944 --> 03:24.160
HE HAD TO PROMISE? WHAT DID
HE HAVE TO PROMISE NOT TO SAY?

03:24.185 --> 03:25.384
DADDY! MOMMY!

03:25.425 --> 03:26.921
OH, SWEETHEART!

03:26.975 --> 03:30.891
OH, WILL YOU
LOOK AT YOU.

03:30.935 --> 03:33.395
YOU ARE GLOWING. WILL YOU
LOOK AT HER, GENE?

03:33.453 --> 03:35.795
IS SHE NOT
LIT FROM WITHIN?

03:35.869 --> 03:37.194
SHE'S LIT.

03:38.332 --> 03:39.969
HELLO, CHARLIE.

03:40.270 --> 03:42.210
-GOOD TO SEE YOU.
-YOU, TOO.

03:47.165 --> 03:48.401
GENE?

03:48.935 --> 03:50.054
CHARLIE.

03:50.260 --> 03:54.063
WELL, THIS IS A HAPPY OCCASION, ISN'T IT?

03:54.601 --> 03:56.760
GENE. GENE?

03:56.806 --> 03:58.087
OH, WHY DON'T WE
GO GET THE BAGGAGE?

03:58.112 --> 03:59.843
UM, BECAUSE WE'RE
PARKED IN A READ ZONE,

03:59.868 --> 04:01.735
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE, UM... BETTER MOVE IT.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.882
UH-OH.

04:02.907 --> 04:03.997
OK.

04:04.022 --> 04:07.141
HE'S A LITTLE BIT OFF. YOU SEE,
THAT AIRLINE BEEF BOURGUIGNON

04:07.194 --> 04:08.265
JUST KIND OF
BOGS HIM DOWN.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.254
BUT HE JUST FINISHED
SAYING HOW HAPPY HE IS.

04:10.301 --> 04:11.484
HE DID.

04:12.213 --> 04:13.206
JOE...

04:13.239 --> 04:15.551
HEY, GORGEOUS.
LOOK AT YOU.

04:15.590 --> 04:16.529
WHERE'S JULIA?

04:16.582 --> 04:17.839
SHE'S PARKING.
SHE'S COMING.

04:17.874 --> 04:20.261
OK.
HERE'S YOUR LIST.

04:20.345 --> 04:22.430
NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET IS MUSIC.

04:22.481 --> 04:23.965
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I THOUGHT WE HAD A BAND.

04:24.032 --> 04:26.335
YEAH, WE DID. BUT THEY HAD
2 OTHER GIGS ON SATURDAY,

04:26.365 --> 04:28.616
AND WHEN I COULDN'T
GUARANTEE THEM A TIME, THEY CANCELLED.

04:28.861 --> 04:30.728
OK. I'M DONE.
CHECK OFF MUSIC.

04:32.668 --> 04:35.590
CODY'S BAND. IT IS, LIKE, SO PERFECT.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.366
NO, I'VE SEEN HIM DO,
LIKE, MOTOWN AND SINATRA,

04:38.390 --> 04:39.725
NIRVANA, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

04:39.778 --> 04:42.078
THE DOOM PATROL?
PLAYING A WEDDING?

04:42.103 --> 04:44.828
JOE!
HEY, STRANGER.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.549
HEY, MEANWHILE,
SOMEONE SHOULD BE ON RENTALS.

04:48.574 --> 04:50.728
WE MIGHT END UP TAKING
AN EMPTY SPACE, IN WHICH CASE---

04:50.768 --> 04:52.221
-JOE.
-HEY.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.984
-HI.
-YES, JOE'S HERE.

04:54.009 --> 04:55.040
WE'VE ESTABLISHED
THAT.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.328
MEANWHILE, ALL WE HAVE
FOR THIS WEDDING

04:56.386 --> 04:57.557
IS A BRIDE, A GROOM,
AND A DATE.

04:57.627 --> 04:59.879
SO IF YOU COULD SPARE
THE HUGGING AND THE KISSING.

05:00.193 --> 05:01.252
SORRY.

05:01.870 --> 05:04.159
UM...WHERE WERE WE?
PUT THE WEDDING PLANS.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.438
WELL, I WAS
ABOUT TO TAKE OVER THE RENTALS,

05:06.463 --> 05:07.310
IF THAT'LL HELP.

05:07.838 --> 05:10.022
JOE, YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER. THANK YOU.

05:10.548 --> 05:13.105
I'M GONNA HEAD DOWNTOWN
AND CHECK OUT THIS BANQUET SPACE.

05:13.556 --> 05:16.886
UH, JULE, CAN YOU GET
NUMBERS FOR ALL THE GUESTS

05:16.911 --> 05:18.153
SO THAT WE CAN
KEEP THEM UPDATED?

05:18.178 --> 05:19.205
SURE THING.

05:19.625 --> 05:20.875
WHAT ABOUT ME,
CAN I...

05:21.421 --> 05:22.594
HELP?

05:23.876 --> 05:25.863
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU GUYS?

05:26.136 --> 05:27.150
NOTHING.

05:27.217 --> 05:29.658
I THINK HE'S JUST STRESSED
OUT ABOUT THE WEDDING,

05:29.684 --> 05:31.954
AND HE WANTS EVERYTHING TO
BE PERFECT FOR CHARLIE.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.726
CLAUDIA, HOW LONG HAS
THIS LETTER BEEN HERE?

05:34.956 --> 05:36.914
THIS LETTER FROM
THE STILLMAN PRESS

05:36.943 --> 05:39.020
THAT I'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT
FOR WEEKS IS POSTMARKED...

05:39.372 --> 05:40.841
-9 DAYS AGO?
-OH,

05:40.885 --> 05:43.388
I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT PILE WAS IT ON?

05:43.412 --> 05:45.938
EVAN STILLMAN WANTS TO MEET
ME, OR AT LEAST HE DID UNTIL I DIDN'T

05:45.963 --> 05:47.538
GET BACK TO HIM. CLAUDIA, OH!

05:50.519 --> 05:51.637
Joe: AH...

05:51.693 --> 05:55.043
WEDDINGS. THEY'RE STRESSFUL
FOR EVERYBODY.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.369
UM...

06:10.637 --> 06:11.390
HI, UM--

06:11.440 --> 06:13.014
YOU KNOW, USUALLY WHEN I
CALL AN UNPUBLISHED

06:13.045 --> 06:14.967
WRITER THEY MAKE AN EFFORT TO SEE ME.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.880
YEAH, SEE, I I SENT IN THE STORY
IN THE SUMMER

06:18.933 --> 06:21.203
WHEN MY RETURN ADDRESS
WAS HOME, BUT NOW I'M BACK AT SCHOOL,

06:21.259 --> 06:23.096
-AND MY SIBLINGS, THEY DIDN'T
-AH, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.661
I'M SORRY?

06:24.945 --> 06:27.322
FOR THE MAGAZINE. YOUR STORY. WHERE IS IT?

06:29.043 --> 06:32.653
AH, THERE.
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.046
OK.

06:35.263 --> 06:37.330
YOU ASKED
TO SEE ME, UH...

06:37.370 --> 06:39.661
YOU KNOW, ONE OUT OF 4
AMERICAN WOMEN GET HIT.

06:39.686 --> 06:41.438
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT THAT'S THE NUMBER.

06:41.495 --> 06:43.357
AND PEOPLE, THEY WRITE
WHAT THEY KNOW.

06:43.393 --> 06:45.483
SO AN AWFUL LOT OF
SUBMISSIONS THAT I GET FROM WOMEN,

06:45.512 --> 06:47.108
THEY'RE BASICALLY YOURS,

06:47.819 --> 06:50.155
AND I'M GONNA BE HONEST
HERE. IT MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT NUTS.

06:51.635 --> 06:53.368
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND--
-BECAUSE...

06:53.814 --> 06:55.720
SOMEWHERE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

06:55.896 --> 06:57.510
SOMETHING MADE YOU
THIS PERSON.

06:57.564 --> 07:00.347
THIS CAPABLE,
TALENTED PERSON.

07:00.405 --> 07:02.377
WHO, WHEN A MAN
RAISED HIS HAND TO YOU,

07:02.438 --> 07:03.645
YOU DIDN'T RUN.

07:04.732 --> 07:06.203
NOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME GOOD REASON,

07:06.360 --> 07:08.094
AND NONE
OF THESE STORIES,

07:08.177 --> 07:10.965
YOURS INCLUDED, NONE OF THEM
TELL ME WHAT THAT IS.

07:11.273 --> 07:13.543
SO, YOU'RE SAYING WHAT,
THAT, UM...

07:13.734 --> 07:15.026
I SHOULD REWRITE IT?

07:15.091 --> 07:17.087
NO.
FORGET YOUR STORY.

07:19.862 --> 07:21.997
OH, I'M BEING OPAQUE.

07:22.449 --> 07:23.701
AH...

07:24.496 --> 07:25.597
(LAUGHS)

07:26.012 --> 07:28.032
I HAVE AN IMPRINT,
MISS SALINGER.

07:28.319 --> 07:30.192

ESSAY COLLECTIONS,

07:31.735 --> 07:34.041
SMALL FIRST-RUNS WITH
RIGHTS THAT I CAN SWING.

07:34.777 --> 07:36.230
NOW, YOU'RE
NOT A BAD WRITER.

07:36.254 --> 07:38.026
AND IF I GOT A PROPOSAL THAT CLICKED--

07:38.051 --> 07:39.506
NON-FICTION...

07:39.531 --> 07:41.720

07:41.766 --> 07:43.963

07:44.013 --> 07:45.334
HOW THEIR WHOLE LIFE,

07:45.381 --> 07:47.644
RIGHT FROM BIRTH, HOW
THAT LEADS THEM TO THIS.

07:48.895 --> 07:51.136
ONE OF MY WINTER TITLES
JUST CROAKED,

07:51.169 --> 07:53.865
SO I HAVE
AN OPEN SLOT.

07:53.948 --> 07:55.845
BUT I'D HAVE TO HAVE IT PRETTY SOON.

07:56.373 --> 07:58.208

WELL, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ANGELA'S ASHES HERE,

MAYBE JUST
A FEW THOUSAND COPIES.

08:03.714 --> 08:04.742
SO...

08:04.768 --> 08:06.242
CAN YOU DO
A PROPOSAL FOR ME?

08:06.316 --> 08:07.429

08:08.493 --> 08:09.616
MISS SALINGER.

08:10.995 --> 08:12.235
COULD YOU?

08:14.132 --> 08:18.535
I AM BEGGING YOU, MY
BOYFRIEND, MY MOST HANDSOMEST,

08:18.560 --> 08:22.370
MOST-LIKED MAN IN MY
LIFE, BESIDES MY BROTHER, WHO--

08:22.830 --> 08:24.572
DID I MENTION
HE'S GETTING MARRIED?

08:24.771 --> 08:28.295
OK? AN EVENT THAT OCCURS ONCE
IN A PERSON'S LIFE.

08:28.696 --> 08:31.555
SOMETIMES TWICE,
BUT IS ALWAYS A HUGE AND

08:31.580 --> 08:33.871
PREVIOUS-ENGAGEMENT-
OVERRIDING OBLIGATION.

08:36.782 --> 08:37.827
ALL RIGHT.

08:37.859 --> 08:39.600
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BLOW
OFF THE OTHER GIG.

08:39.657 --> 08:40.832
YES.

08:43.325 --> 08:44.550
WAIT, THAT'S IT?

08:45.407 --> 08:47.040
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
MY WEDDING TO-DO LIST?

08:47.065 --> 08:48.997
LIKE,
1100 PRIORITY ITEMS.

08:49.059 --> 08:51.014
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

08:51.757 --> 08:54.225
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T SEE YOU ANYMORE.

08:54.696 --> 08:57.946
I MEAN, WE'RE TOGETHER
2, 3 HOURS, AND THEN...

08:57.978 --> 09:00.272
CLANG,
THE CURFEW BELL.

09:01.556 --> 09:04.088
'CAUSE I'M NOT READY TO DO
THE SLEEPOVER THING.

09:06.094 --> 09:08.750
WELL, THAT'S
PART OF IT, YEAH.

09:08.956 --> 09:11.369
LOOK, AS SOON AS
THIS WEDDING'S OVER...

09:11.492 --> 09:13.450
I PROMISE. WE'LL MAKE MORE TIME. REALLY.

09:16.127 --> 09:18.039
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY
BUMMED I'M LEAVING.

09:19.838 --> 09:21.754
YEAH. I AM.

09:22.465 --> 09:24.453
WELL...

09:24.512 --> 09:27.000
JUST FOR THAT,
I'M STAYING.

09:28.730 --> 09:31.276
FOR ANOTHER 5 MINUTES.

09:34.103 --> 09:35.932
GUYS, GUYS,
WE GOTTA GET MOVING.

09:35.957 --> 09:37.196
WE'RE ALREADY LATE
FOR OUR TABLE,

09:37.250 --> 09:38.620
AND WE GOTTA MEET BAILEY
AFTER WE EAT.

09:38.645 --> 09:39.747
OK?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.870
HI, I'M SORRY TO STOP BY
WITHOUT CALLING,

09:42.904 --> 09:45.581
BUT I COULDN'T FIND
HER THERMOMETER IN THE BAG, SO I THOUGHT--

09:45.606 --> 09:46.874
HELLO.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.600
I'M ELLIE.
YOU MUST BE DAPHNE.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.228
AND WHO IS THIS HERE?
IS THIS DIANA?

09:52.253 --> 09:54.365
OH, LOOK, GENE,
IT'S DIANA.

09:55.973 --> 09:58.151
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

09:58.219 --> 09:59.955
WHAT, IS SHE--
IS SHE SICK?

10:00.001 --> 10:01.840
NO, SHE'S FINE,
SHE'S GREAT,

10:01.865 --> 10:03.260
BUT IF I LET
SOMEONE HOLD HER,

10:03.300 --> 10:05.286
THEN MY WHOLE TRAINING
REGIMEN IS TOAST.

10:05.311 --> 10:06.410
TRAINING REGIMEN?

10:06.435 --> 10:09.163
YEAH, WELL, SEE, I'VE NEVER
HAD DIANA ALL TO MYSELF

10:09.199 --> 10:10.913
FOR MORE THAN
A DAY AT A TIME,

10:11.055 --> 10:12.205
AND, YOU KNOW,
CHARLIE AND KIRSTEN

10:12.250 --> 10:14.699
ARE GOING OFF ON THEIR
LITTLE HONEYMOON THING FOR, UM...

10:14.758 --> 10:16.285
UH...HOW LONG
IS THAT FOR?

10:16.318 --> 10:17.370
-11 DAYS.
-11 DAYS.

10:17.744 --> 10:18.977
CHARLIE'S RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA MISS--

10:19.042 --> 10:19.814
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR

10:19.844 --> 10:21.621
-OUR TABLE, SO...
-11 DAYS.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.811
I MEAN, I HAVE TO WORK UP
TO THAT, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE, GOD, YOU THINK,

10:24.871 --> 10:26.946
LIKE MANILIUS READ
CAESAR'S HOROSCOPE

10:26.986 --> 10:28.648
WITHOUT A FEW
PRACTICE CHARTS FIRST?

10:28.673 --> 10:31.254
NO. YOU THINK A-- DO YOU
THINK A MANDARIN HEALER

10:31.320 --> 10:33.984
JUST STARTS STICKING NEEDLES
IN PEOPLE, LIKE, RIGHT AWAY?

10:34.012 --> 10:37.070
UM, HER THERMOMETER
IS IN THE BATHROOM.

10:37.787 --> 10:39.982
OH, OK. THANKS.
EXCUSE ME, I'M JUST--

10:40.007 --> 10:41.020
SURE THING.

10:41.045 --> 10:42.249
COME ON,
SWEETIE PIE.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.814
-WELL, THAT WAS PRETTY RICH.
-DON'T, GENE.

10:45.852 --> 10:47.870
I DON'T HAVE TO.
SHE SPEAKS FOR HERSELF.

10:48.028 --> 10:50.861
-MEANING WHAT, EXACTLY?
-CHARLIE. PLEASE.

10:51.308 --> 10:53.608
THIS IS THE HOME YOU'VE MADE
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

10:54.266 --> 10:55.947
AN OUT-OF-WEDLOCK CHILD?

10:56.131 --> 10:58.979
WITH A WOMAN I WOULDN'T
TRUST WITH MY HOUSEPLANTS.

10:59.031 --> 11:00.560
THAT'S ENOUGH, DADDY.
I MEAN IT.

11:00.642 --> 11:02.365
WHAT?
YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

11:02.765 --> 11:04.055
THAT'S WHAT
YOUR MOTHER WANTS.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.079
STAND UP AT
MY OWN DAUGHTER'S WEDDING

11:06.132 --> 11:08.356
AND SMILE AND PRETEND,
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

11:09.111 --> 11:10.484
YEAH.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.201
LET'S TRY THAT.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.662
YOU MIND?

11:16.028 --> 11:17.203
PLENTY OF SEATING.

11:17.683 --> 11:21.265
AND I LOVE THESE... STAINED
GLASS, WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?

11:21.311 --> 11:22.884
-ROSETTES?
-YEAH.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.634
WHAT?

11:25.990 --> 11:27.253
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:28.766 --> 11:31.239
SARAH, WE'VE LOOKED AT
1000 PLACES ALREADY--

11:31.264 --> 11:32.999
-I KNOW.
-AND THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE

11:33.024 --> 11:34.266
CHURCH AFTER THIS IS IN RENO.

11:34.312 --> 11:35.653
I KNOW. BUT DO YOU
REALLY THINK

11:35.683 --> 11:37.603
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO GET
MARRIED AT 8 A.M.?

11:38.373 --> 11:40.429
SO, HAVE YOU MADE
UP YOUR MINDS?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.013
AH...

11:42.275 --> 11:43.814
I GUESS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO WAIT FOR CHARLIE.

11:43.838 --> 11:45.032
WE CAN WAIT
TILL TOMORROW.

11:45.098 --> 11:46.764
WHEN ALL THEY'LL
HAVE LEFT IS MIDNIGHT?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.126
NO, WE GOTTA
MOVE ON THIS.

11:49.093 --> 11:50.937
OK, YES.
WE'LL TAKE IT.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.450
FINE, THEN. 8:00 SATURDAY MORNING.

11:53.528 --> 11:54.637
OK.

11:55.001 --> 11:57.104
OH, UH,
THE LUCKY COUPLE.

11:57.135 --> 11:58.325
IS THAT YOU?

11:59.456 --> 12:01.058
WHAT? OH...

12:01.083 --> 12:02.878
NO, IT'S...

12:02.947 --> 12:04.594
MY BROTHER
AND HIS FIANCéE.

12:04.619 --> 12:06.345
BUT SOMEDAY...

12:06.415 --> 12:08.372
SOMEDAY, MAYBE...
I HOPE.

12:10.238 --> 12:11.366
THANK YOU.

12:11.408 --> 12:12.610
SURELY.

12:20.325 --> 12:21.741
BAILEY...

12:23.889 --> 12:24.951
WHAT?

12:26.006 --> 12:29.446
WHAT DID I SAY? IS IT--
IS IT WRONG TO HOPE FOR SOMEDAY?

12:29.609 --> 12:31.845
-I DO.
-YOU HOPE...

12:31.907 --> 12:33.785
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW,
DO YOU?

12:35.559 --> 12:36.633
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

12:36.685 --> 12:38.616
WELL, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT, SARAH.

12:38.659 --> 12:41.009
THAT'S WHY IT HURTS. BECAUSE
I'M THE ONE WHO KNOWS.

12:41.688 --> 12:44.299
OK, SO PLEASE,
JUST DON'T...

12:59.065 --> 13:01.212
DO YOU LIKE
SUGAR ALMONDS?

13:01.809 --> 13:03.425
NO, NOT REALLY.

13:04.897 --> 13:06.192
ME NEITHER.

13:07.714 --> 13:09.007
KNOW ANYONE
WHO DOES?

13:10.543 --> 13:12.004
ONE OR 2 PEOPLE,
I GUESS.

13:13.157 --> 13:14.739
THEN WHY ARE
WE MAKING THESE?

13:15.739 --> 13:17.432
YOU GUYS
ARE STILL DOING THOSE?

13:17.868 --> 13:19.600
YOU ACTUALLY WORKING
OR JUST TALKING,

13:19.658 --> 13:21.355
CAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.540
WHY IS BAILEY SO MAD AT YOU, SARAH?

13:29.416 --> 13:30.768
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:31.096 --> 13:32.438
IT'S 'CAUSE...

13:32.480 --> 13:33.851
HE GAVE
THAT RING BACK?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.381
I DON'T KNOW, OWEN.

13:37.827 --> 13:38.861
MAYBE.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.198
SHOULD I BE MAD, TOO?

13:41.536 --> 13:42.678
NUH-UH.

13:42.703 --> 13:43.957
NO.

13:45.232 --> 13:46.365
WHY NOT?

13:46.751 --> 13:49.091
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
GIVE YOUR RING BACK.

13:49.148 --> 13:50.427
BUT WHAT IF YOU DID?

13:51.268 --> 13:52.519
SHOULD I BE MAD?

13:53.744 --> 13:55.002
YOU COULD BE.

13:55.261 --> 13:56.695
YEAH.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.557
WHY?

13:58.756 --> 14:00.976
BECAUSE, IF...

14:01.002 --> 14:03.233
YOU LOVED ME ENOUGH
TO ASK, THEN...

14:05.319 --> 14:07.333
I SHOULD LOVE YOU
ENOUGH TO SAY YES.

14:07.961 --> 14:09.387
YOU SHOULD?

14:11.741 --> 14:13.300
WHO SAYS?

14:14.324 --> 14:15.728
WELL...

14:19.207 --> 14:20.691
I DON'T KNOW.

14:22.613 --> 14:26.580
(GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS)

14:53.822 --> 14:55.494
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

14:57.141 --> 14:58.679
THAT BETTER NOT BE
MY PARENTS

14:58.704 --> 15:00.398
SAYING THAT THEY HATE
THEIR HOTEL ROOM.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.085
(LAUGHS)

15:02.620 --> 15:04.069
-HEY.
-HI.

15:04.648 --> 15:07.348
HI.
OH, UH...

15:07.438 --> 15:09.412
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
BAILEY WAS COMING OVER.

15:09.463 --> 15:10.792
-OH, I-
-I CAN COME LATER.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.351
-NO. NO, STAY.
-NO.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.603
-YOU SURE?
-YEAH.

15:13.628 --> 15:14.727
OK.

15:15.452 --> 15:17.087
SO, LISTEN...

15:17.207 --> 15:19.953
I BOOKED US A BANQUET ROOM
AT THE FAIRMONT.

15:20.029 --> 15:21.254
A BEAUTIFUL SPACE.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.050
UH, WAIT,
THE FAIRMONT?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.674
ISN'T THAT
KIND OF FORMAL?

15:24.699 --> 15:27.437
YEAH, BUT IT'S HUGE, AND I
GOT A GREAT PRICE, BECAUSE...

15:27.482 --> 15:29.901
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMPETITION AT 9 A.M.

15:30.544 --> 15:31.857
9 A.M.?

15:32.322 --> 15:33.370
I...

15:33.395 --> 15:34.733
FORGOT TO
TELL YOU THAT, TOO.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.594
BAILEY GOT US
A CHURCH AT 8:00.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.666
YOU WON'T DO BETTER
AT THIS POINT.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.171
AH...

15:42.259 --> 15:43.883
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND?

15:44.218 --> 15:45.853
YEAH, OF COURSE
WE CAN, BUT...

15:45.887 --> 15:48.067
I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING NOW,

15:48.133 --> 15:50.348
AND IF YOU WANT A WEDDING
THAT IS SPECIAL AT ALL--

15:50.402 --> 15:52.265
UNLESS MAYBE, UM...

15:52.316 --> 15:55.398
IF WE--IF WE TRIED REALLY
HARD, MAYBE WE COULD MAKE THE...

15:56.605 --> 15:58.014
THE BACKYARD SPECIAL.

15:59.076 --> 16:00.071
THE BACKYARD?

16:00.095 --> 16:01.970
WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.

16:02.024 --> 16:03.288
BUT BAILEY...

16:03.347 --> 16:06.181
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S STARTING TO FEEL LIKE...

16:06.268 --> 16:08.488
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE...

16:08.546 --> 16:09.847
IT'S NOT
OUR WEDDING.

16:09.872 --> 16:13.261
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T LOVE LOTS
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WE DO.

16:13.286 --> 16:15.044
BUT ME AND KIRSTEN,
WE'D REALLY--

16:15.131 --> 16:19.477
A CASUAL WEDDING
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE... I DON'T KNOW, LIKE...

16:19.522 --> 16:21.134
JUST...
MORE US.

16:21.169 --> 16:22.261
RIGHT.

16:24.948 --> 16:26.107
WELL...

16:26.153 --> 16:29.028
THERE'S AN OBVIOUS
ANSWER HERE, WHICH IS...

16:31.364 --> 16:34.227
INSTEAD OF ME TRYING TO
GUESS WHAT YOU GUYS WANT,

16:35.506 --> 16:37.174
YOU SHOULD
DO IT YOURSELVES.

16:37.753 --> 16:38.958
-NO, WAIT.
-BAILEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.031
NO, NO, NO.
I GET IT.

16:43.379 --> 16:44.702
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

16:48.030 --> 16:49.253
SO...

16:51.023 --> 16:52.250
IT'S ALL YOURS.

17:04.347 --> 17:05.447
OH! HELLO.

17:05.478 --> 17:06.240
HI.

17:06.288 --> 17:08.331
I'M SORRY. I JUST-- I
NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:08.356 --> 17:09.546
LISTEN, IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

17:09.571 --> 17:10.778
I'M NOT GOING
TO GET TO IT TONIGHT,

17:10.854 --> 17:12.653
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE IT IN THE SLOT.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.963
WH-LEAVE WHAT?

17:14.228 --> 17:15.231
THE PROPOSAL.

17:15.256 --> 17:18.038
HA HA! UM, WELL,
THE PROPOSAL,

17:18.071 --> 17:19.750
I'M PRETTY HAPPY
WITH THE FIRST PAGE,

17:19.786 --> 17:21.210
BUT OTHER
THAN THAT...

17:21.259 --> 17:22.461
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:22.532 --> 17:25.635
WELL, TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU, NEITHER DO I.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.958
I JUST...I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

17:29.011 --> 17:31.742
IT'S TOO MUCH WORK
WITHOUT ALL THE SCHOOL STUFF,

17:31.782 --> 17:33.213
BUT WHEN YOU ADD
ALL THAT IN...

17:33.253 --> 17:35.508
WELL, ISN'T THERE A WRITING
PROGRAM AT STANFORD?

17:35.568 --> 17:37.745
SO YOU COULD COUNT A
PROJECT LIKE THIS AS COURSE WORK?

17:37.798 --> 17:41.260
WELL, YEAH, BUT THEN I STILL
HAVE OTHER CLASSES AND EXTRACURRICS.

17:41.341 --> 17:42.729
WELL, THEN I DON'T KNOW.

17:42.754 --> 17:44.410
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRANSFER.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.916
GO TO A COLLEGE THAT'S
ALL ABOUT WRITING.

17:47.688 --> 17:49.080
YOU THINK?

17:50.536 --> 17:51.885
HOW WOULD I--
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

17:51.922 --> 17:53.094
IT'S OCTOBER ALREADY.

17:53.979 --> 17:55.908
WELL, I'M ON THE BOARD
AT CFA,

17:55.968 --> 17:58.150
AND I BET THEY WOULD
FIND A SPOT

17:58.183 --> 17:59.318
IF I TOLD THEM
ABOUT YOU.

17:59.355 --> 18:02.605
COLLEGE OF...FINE ARTS?
THAT PROGRAM IS--

18:02.631 --> 18:05.582
RACHEL LIPPMAN WENT THERE.
JIM CINCOTTA, BROOKE SWENSON.

18:05.628 --> 18:07.935
YEAH. YOU KNOW, LISTEN, CAN
WE TAKE CARE OF THIS TOMORROW?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.656
I'M EXTREMELY
LATE FOR DINNER.

18:09.684 --> 18:11.180
RIGHT, RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

18:11.580 --> 18:14.102
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
IF I WERE TO DO THAT,

18:14.127 --> 18:15.852
I'D BE THROWING MY ENTIRE
LIFE INTO WRITING,

18:15.878 --> 18:18.291
SO THE WHOLE LIBERAL
ARTS, MULTI-DISCIPLINE THING--

18:18.318 --> 18:19.548
YOU KNOW, ADIOS--

18:19.577 --> 18:21.114
LISTEN, I DON'T
MEAN TO RUDE--

18:21.145 --> 18:23.433
THAT IS HUGE. YOU REALLY
THINK THAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME?

18:24.674 --> 18:26.984
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST MET YOU YESTERDAY.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.804
AND FRANKLY, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF YOU'RE WRITING THIS BOOK.

18:30.108 --> 18:33.544
SO...DOES ANY OF THIS
MAKE ANY SENSE FOR YOU?

18:33.578 --> 18:36.190
UM...I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

18:37.368 --> 18:38.393
YOU MIND?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.740
SORRY.

18:46.596 --> 18:49.269
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHY THEY
ASKED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:49.734 --> 18:53.230
IT'S NOT LIKE WE EVER AGREED
ON WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

18:53.516 --> 18:56.015
THE MORE TIME WENT BY,
THE MORE THEY WERE, LIKE...

18:56.077 --> 18:58.128
LIKE I WAS FORCING STUFF
ON THEM, YOU KNOW?

18:58.164 --> 19:00.327
LIKE--LIKE I THOUGHT
I WAS MINE.

19:00.417 --> 19:01.694
-LIKE--LIKE I THOUGHT--
-IT IS.

19:03.699 --> 19:05.228
IT IS YOUR WEDDING,
BAILEY.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.375
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

19:10.102 --> 19:11.803
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU'VE
TRIED TO MAKE IT.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.595
WHAT ARE YOU--

19:13.620 --> 19:16.485
EVERY TIME YOU PUSH FOR IT TO
BE A BIGGER PRODUCTION,

19:17.168 --> 19:20.188
EVERY TIME YOU TALK
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.052
2 PEOPLE PROMISING
LOVE TO EACH OTHER.

19:23.082 --> 19:26.360
-OK. HOLD ON--
-ALL I DID WAS SAY WAIT.

19:27.911 --> 19:31.250
OK? ALL I DID WAS SAY
I'M NOT SURE YET.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.662
AND THAT IS MY RIGHT.

19:35.159 --> 19:37.715
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
I COULD SAY NO.

19:38.101 --> 19:41.335
I COULD SAY I WON'T
MARRY YOU NOW OR EVER,

19:41.372 --> 19:43.048
AND THAT IS STILL
MY RIGHT.

19:44.694 --> 19:47.700
I MEAN, I HAVE-- I HAVE
BEEN SOAKING UP YOUR ANGER NOW

19:47.740 --> 19:49.662
FOR, WHAT, LIKE,
4 MONTHS,

19:49.699 --> 19:52.659
AND THE ONLY REASON
I DIDN'T SAY STOP...

19:53.043 --> 19:55.183
YOU KNOW,
STOP PUNISHING ME

19:55.208 --> 19:56.933
IS BECAUSE
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON,

19:56.958 --> 19:58.950
I LOVE YOU, BAILEY.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.579
STILL...

20:03.428 --> 20:06.048
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN TREATING
ME LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF BEAST.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.880
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE SCARY MOMENT REALLY.

20:23.905 --> 20:26.628
SHE TRIED TO EAT
A STRING OF BEADS.

20:26.662 --> 20:28.697
BUT THEN SHE JUST
LOOKED AT ME LIKE,

20:28.755 --> 20:32.763
OH, MOMMY,
DON'T SWEAT IT AND UHH!

20:32.802 --> 20:35.166
BUT I THINK
THEY ALL CAME OUT, SO...

20:35.221 --> 20:36.664
GOOD. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DID REALLY GOOD.

20:36.698 --> 20:37.706
THANKS.

20:37.731 --> 20:39.438
KIRSTEN, DO YOU WANT
TO THROW A GARTER?

20:39.484 --> 20:41.138
BECAUSE IT SAYS IN THIS MAGAZINE
THAT THEY DON'T--

20:41.178 --> 20:42.286
THEY DON'T REALLY
DO THAT ANYMORE.

20:42.311 --> 20:44.017
AH, IT'S A STUPID,
SEXIST TRADITION,

20:44.042 --> 20:45.443
BUT YES, I WANT TO.

20:45.513 --> 20:47.083
OK. GOOD.

20:47.715 --> 20:50.700
DAPH, UH, DO YOU
HAVE A GARTER AT HOME?

20:51.539 --> 20:52.758
A GARTER?

20:52.997 --> 20:54.478
CLOTH OR PAPER?

20:54.532 --> 20:56.338
DO YOU NEED ONE WITH POCKETS?
I HAVE THIS ONE--

20:56.398 --> 20:58.068
UM, WE'LL--
WE'LL CALL YOU.

20:58.151 --> 21:00.938
OK.
GOOD SEEING YOU GUYS.

21:01.106 --> 21:02.114
HEH HEH.

21:02.139 --> 21:03.715
-SEE YA, DAPH.
-Daphne: BYE.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.965
(LAUGHING)

21:06.999 --> 21:08.183
GENE, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

21:08.247 --> 21:09.365
NOT A WORD.

21:11.001 --> 21:12.168
I'M FINE.

21:12.674 --> 21:13.883
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT.

21:14.334 --> 21:15.947
WHAT'S WITH
THE CHORTLE, DAD?

21:15.979 --> 21:17.478
DO YA--DO YA HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY?

21:17.784 --> 21:19.784
NO! NO, HE DOESN'T.

21:19.825 --> 21:21.111
LET HIM ANSWER, MOM.

21:22.037 --> 21:23.160
DADDY?

21:23.838 --> 21:27.777
I WAS JUST TAKING NOTE
OF THE OBVIOUS, THAT'S ALL.

21:27.802 --> 21:29.124
WHAT "OBVIOUS"?

21:29.668 --> 21:31.383
WHAT, THAT DAPHNE
USED TO STRIP?

21:31.409 --> 21:33.061
KIRSTEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

21:33.086 --> 21:34.748
YOU THINK THAT MAKES YOU
BETTER THAN HER?

21:35.297 --> 21:37.616
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU HANDLE A
TENTH OF WHAT SHE HAS.

21:37.676 --> 21:39.340
-WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
-STOP IT, GENE.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.175
WELL, SHE'S TALKING TO ME.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:41.208 --> 21:42.937
JUST SHUT UP BEFORE YOU UPSET HER.

21:42.984 --> 21:45.360
-SHE'S UPSETTING ME!
-YOU CAN HANDLE IT. SHE CAN'T!

21:46.579 --> 21:48.071
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

21:51.252 --> 21:53.807
I--I--I JUST KNOW HOW
YOUR FATHER UPSETS YOU.

21:54.087 --> 21:55.466
YEAH, I'M UPSET.

21:56.344 --> 21:58.270
I'M NOT ON THE VERGE
OF A BREAKDOWN.

21:58.390 --> 22:00.244
WELL, I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE--

22:00.337 --> 22:02.059
NO, I KNOW.
YOU KEEP SAYING,

22:02.119 --> 22:04.215
"DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL BE OK,"

22:04.292 --> 22:06.104
LIKE I'M ON THE LEDGE
OR SOMETHING.

22:06.129 --> 22:08.540
WHICH REALLY MEANS, YOU
THINK I'M MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

22:08.599 --> 22:10.038
-KIRSTEN--
-HOW CAN YOU NOT?

22:10.577 --> 22:12.197
IF YOU DON'T THINK
I'M UP TO AN ARGUMENT,

22:12.276 --> 22:14.101
HOW CAN I HANDLE
A MOVE LIKE THIS?

22:14.301 --> 22:16.301
LOOK, SWEETHEART, UM...

22:17.646 --> 22:20.691
A WEDDING IS A VERY
STRESSFUL TIME, EVEN FOR--FOR SOMEONE--

22:20.716 --> 22:22.725
I DON'T EVEN WANT YOU
TO FINISH THAT THOUGHT.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.537
WELL,
THEN JUST FORGET IT.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.572
OK? JUST
FORGET WHAT I SAID.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.405
IT'S YOUR WEDDING. I MEAN,
WHO CARES WHAT I THINK?

22:29.985 --> 22:31.359
I CARE.

22:32.611 --> 22:35.438
IT MATTERS TO ME
WHAT YOU AND DADDY THINK.

22:36.001 --> 22:37.701
YOU'RE
MY MOTHER AND FATHER.

22:38.896 --> 22:41.836
AND IF YOU--
IF YOU CAN'T SUPPORT THIS,

22:42.343 --> 22:43.816
THEN I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU.

22:45.278 --> 22:46.662
YOU CAN COME
TO THE WEDDING,

22:47.765 --> 22:48.978
BUT I DON'T
WANT TO SEE YOU.

23:00.661 --> 23:02.025
HEY, CLAUDIA!

23:03.577 --> 23:04.773
LOOK, I'VE BEEN CALLING.

23:04.798 --> 23:07.130
I'VE GOT A MILLION QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS WEDDING THING.

23:07.155 --> 23:08.859
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WHERE, WHEN, WHAT?

23:08.884 --> 23:10.326
I COULD REALLY USE
A PLAYLIST.

23:10.363 --> 23:11.688
COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST SHUT UP.

23:12.251 --> 23:13.311
WHAT?

23:13.887 --> 23:15.387
IT'S TOO LATE
TO FIRE YOU, CODY,

23:15.438 --> 23:16.913
CAUSE WE REALLY NEED
YOUR BAND,

23:16.973 --> 23:19.817
BUT HEARING YOU MAKE
EXCUSES IS JUST GONNA MAKE ME MAD.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.034
SO I THINK
THE BEST THING, REALLY,

23:21.059 --> 23:23.615
FOR ALL OF US FROM HERE ON OUT,
IS YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,

23:23.640 --> 23:25.453
CALL CHARLIE, HE'LL GET YOU
WHAT YOU NEED AND...

23:26.284 --> 23:27.602
I'LL JUST GO
GET ON MY BUS.

23:27.627 --> 23:28.667
WAIT A MINUTE.

23:28.697 --> 23:29.883
CLAUD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:29.933 --> 23:32.067
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THAT THIS WHOLE THING,

23:32.109 --> 23:36.288
THIS--THIS NEW GIRL, THIS
DANCING GUITAR WITH LIPS,

23:36.313 --> 23:38.225
WAS JUST BECAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE SEX, CODY.

23:38.264 --> 23:40.138
OH, MY GOD.
YOU KNOW ABOUT PAIGE.

23:42.035 --> 23:44.162
WAIT, CLAUD,
SHE'S OUT OF THE BAND, OK?

23:44.187 --> 23:45.439
I MEAN, IT'S OVER.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.143
I DON'T CARE, CODY.

23:48.251 --> 23:50.258
AND I AM SO,
SO SORRY.

23:50.288 --> 23:52.376
I AM SO
INCREDIBLY SORRY.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.805
YEAH, I SAID
I DON'T CARE.

23:53.830 --> 23:56.120
WAIT! YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

23:56.613 --> 23:58.774
YOU CAN'T JUST ACT LIKE
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY OVER.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.089
REALLY? WHY NOT?

24:00.288 --> 24:01.883
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT FAIR.

24:02.683 --> 24:05.826
BECAUSE, OK, SO, IT HAD TO DO
WITH THE SEX THING.

24:05.876 --> 24:08.093
SO I'M USED TO HAVING SEX
WITH THE PEOPLE I DATE--

24:08.134 --> 24:09.729
OK, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS.

24:09.779 --> 24:10.978
WELL, I HEARD YOU.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.040
OK?

24:13.065 --> 24:14.746
I LISTENED TO WHY
YOU WANTED TO WAIT,

24:14.771 --> 24:17.038
AND I TRIED REALLY HARD
TO UNDERSTAND.

24:18.018 --> 24:20.357
CAN YOU PLEASE TRY
AND DO THE SAME FOR ME?

24:25.738 --> 24:28.138
THE THING IS, GRIFFIN,
IT'S BIGGER THAN JUST

24:28.196 --> 24:29.952
ONE SCHOOL VERSUS
THE OTHER.

24:30.632 --> 24:32.739
CAUSE--THANK YOU.

24:32.795 --> 24:35.921
BECAUSE ONE WAY I'M LIVING
A NORMAL COLLEGE EXISTENCE

24:35.946 --> 24:37.954
WITH ALL KINDS
OF STUFF IN MY LIFE,

24:38.379 --> 24:41.907
AND THE OTHER WAY IT'S
WALL-TO-WALL WRITING.

24:42.378 --> 24:44.004
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS WRITING.

24:44.598 --> 24:45.978
AND WHAT IF
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT?

24:46.931 --> 24:50.254
I MEAN, WHEN I PUT ALL MY EGGS
IN THAT ONE BASKET,

24:50.313 --> 24:52.439
IT'S...MMM...

24:52.485 --> 24:55.225
IT'S A LIFETIME DEAL,
YOU KNOW? KIND OF LIKE--

24:55.250 --> 24:57.457
WELL, LIKE
CHARLIE AND KIRSTEN.

24:58.255 --> 24:59.787
WHAT, YOU CAN'T GET
OUT OF THAT LATER?

25:01.135 --> 25:02.908
I MEAN, YOU GOT OUT OF
BEING MARRIED TO ME.

25:03.093 --> 25:04.261
OH, COME ON, GRIFFIN.
THAT WAS PRACTICALLY

25:04.295 --> 25:05.686
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
I'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH,

25:05.711 --> 25:06.965
BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

25:06.990 --> 25:07.863
SO, THAT'S
WHAT I'M SAYING.

25:07.888 --> 25:09.863
I NEVER WANT TO GO THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN.

25:11.242 --> 25:13.957
WELL, JULS, I...

25:13.982 --> 25:15.310
I DON'T KNOW.

25:16.343 --> 25:18.184
I MEAN,
LET'S FACE IT.

25:18.258 --> 25:20.725
YOU AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN
ON ONE WAVELENGTH.

25:21.122 --> 25:22.576
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

25:23.117 --> 25:25.595
WHAT I'M DOING IS, UH...

25:25.634 --> 25:26.948
I'M JUST TAKING IT SLOW.

25:27.801 --> 25:30.716
YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I'M TRYING
TO GET MY BUSINESS STARTED AGAIN.

25:31.003 --> 25:32.748
SO I'M KEEPING
A LOW OVERHEAD,

25:32.794 --> 25:34.730
AND I'M NOT TAKING
ANY JOBS I CAN'T HANDLE.

25:35.141 --> 25:36.528
WORKING OUT OF THE SHIT.

25:37.730 --> 25:38.916
I MEAN, I'M ONLY 21,

25:38.948 --> 25:40.923
BUT LOOK WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

25:43.490 --> 25:45.323
WHICH JUST
TELLS ME THAT, UH,

25:45.348 --> 25:46.615
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S TIME.

25:48.536 --> 25:49.930
THERE'S ALWAYS
PLENTY OF TIME.

25:51.975 --> 25:53.516
HMM.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.803
-HEY.
-OH, HEY.

26:04.315 --> 26:06.228
SO, UH, LISTEN...

26:07.772 --> 26:09.089
YOU'RE STILL MY BEST MAN,

26:09.191 --> 26:12.233
SO I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT YOUR PROPS.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.260
THE RINGS.

26:15.285 --> 26:16.390
YUP.

26:16.597 --> 26:19.375
JUST, UM, JUST
WAIT FOR YOUR CUE

26:19.573 --> 26:23.150
AND...NO DROPPING COINS ON
THE FLOOR TRYING TO FREAK ME OUT.

26:23.265 --> 26:24.862
-HEH.
-HEH HEH HEH.

26:25.424 --> 26:26.772
YOU GOT IT.

26:27.733 --> 26:29.060
SO, UH...

26:30.963 --> 26:32.356
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT
AT THE HOUSE.

26:33.764 --> 26:35.011
IT'S GONNA BE...

26:35.335 --> 26:38.623
PRETTY MELLOW REALLY. NO FLYING
DOVES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.462
BUT, UH...

26:43.093 --> 26:44.930
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE OK
WITH HOW IT IS,

26:44.955 --> 26:46.230
BECAUSE, I MEAN--

26:46.856 --> 26:48.495
YEAH, IT IS
OUR WEDDING, BUT...

26:49.620 --> 26:51.223
IT MATTERS TO ME
WHAT YOU THINK.

26:56.537 --> 26:58.013
SARAH SAYS...

26:59.588 --> 27:02.801
SHE THINKS THAT I'VE BEEN
SO INSANE OVER YOUR WEDDING

27:02.867 --> 27:08.329
BECAUSE... WELL, BASICALLY,
I WISHED IT WAS MINE.

27:09.209 --> 27:10.876
I MEAN, THIS WEDDING--

27:10.901 --> 27:12.646
BAILEY, BAILEY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

27:12.671 --> 27:14.543
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

27:17.456 --> 27:20.146
IT'S MORE THAN THE SARAH THING, CHARLIE.

27:21.435 --> 27:22.743
IT'S...

27:24.338 --> 27:25.837
EVER SINCE THEY DIED,

27:26.948 --> 27:31.472
FOR ALMOST...
6 YEARS NOW, OUR FAMILY,

27:31.658 --> 27:34.086
WE'VE BEEN...
THIS...THING--

27:34.126 --> 27:37.565
THIS--THIS THING THAT WE
WEREN'T EVER SURE WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

27:37.595 --> 27:39.301
BUT WHEN ALL OF US
PULLED TOGETHER...

27:42.002 --> 27:43.361
I DON'T KNOW.

27:44.708 --> 27:46.018
IT WAS GOOD.

27:47.109 --> 27:48.124
DEFINITELY.

27:48.149 --> 27:52.379
BUT NOW...
IT'S BASICALLY OVER.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.607
BAILEY, COME ON,
THAT IS NOT--

27:54.632 --> 27:57.726
CHARLIE, YOU'RE LEAVING
US HERE. YOU ARE.

27:57.751 --> 27:59.110
BAILEY, I AM NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

27:59.149 --> 28:00.540
YOU--
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.827
I WANT THIS FOR YOU.
I DO.

28:05.013 --> 28:08.885
FOR YOU...
TO HAVE YOUR OWN FAMILY.

28:09.611 --> 28:12.589
BUT...WHEN YOU
SAY STUFF LIKE--

28:13.102 --> 28:14.461
LIKE, IT'S NO BIG DEAL

28:14.486 --> 28:17.280
AND--AND THAT THIS WEDDING
WILL JUST BE SOME CASUAL THING,

28:17.316 --> 28:18.727
WELL, THAT BUGS ME, MAN.

28:19.639 --> 28:21.517
BECAUSE
THIS IS MY THING, TOO.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.495
AND JULIA'S AND
CLAUDIA'S AND OWEN'S.

28:27.212 --> 28:31.561
IT'S OUR THING...
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

28:33.619 --> 28:35.635
IT'S OUR THING
FOR LETTING YOU GO.

28:49.058 --> 28:52.419
OK, DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT THIS WEDDING IS NOW?

28:52.492 --> 28:55.776
VAGUELY. SORT OF.
NOT REALLY.

28:55.825 --> 28:57.166
HOLD STILL. I'M TRYING TO PIN THIS.

28:57.191 --> 28:59.654
BAILEY SAID SOMETHING,
AND NOW, EVER SINCE THEN,

28:59.709 --> 29:01.672
CHARLIE'S BEEN RACING
AROUND LIKE A CRAZY MAN.

29:01.697 --> 29:04.157
EVERYTHING'S BEEN MOVED
FROM THE BACKYARD TO...

29:04.201 --> 29:06.024
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE IT IS NOW.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.148
-GREAT.
-UH, SO, WE'RE, LIKE,

29:07.173 --> 29:08.623
ACTUALLY, LIKE,
WASTING OUR TIME

29:08.665 --> 29:10.880
WITH THESE LOVELY COSTUMES HERE? (LAUGHS)

29:10.957 --> 29:12.667
CHARLIE SWEARS
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

29:12.692 --> 29:14.248
SOMEHOW. SOMEWHERE.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.708
-OK?
-MM-HMM.

29:18.003 --> 29:20.695
OK, LISTEN, I'M GONNA GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND STEAL SOME FILM.

29:20.728 --> 29:21.828
ALL RIGHT.

29:22.380 --> 29:24.395
-KIRSTEN, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
-YEAH.

29:24.519 --> 29:25.544
THANK YOU.

29:33.201 --> 29:34.778
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:35.890 --> 29:37.210
WOW.

29:38.469 --> 29:40.573
YOU LOOK...WOW.

29:41.992 --> 29:44.072
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
SEE ME BEFORE THE WEDDING.

29:44.118 --> 29:46.462
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT
I NEEDED SOME CORKSCREWS

29:46.487 --> 29:49.541
AND--AND BAR STUFF, AND
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO BUY 'EM

29:49.575 --> 29:52.112
BETWEEN THE CANDLES
AND THE FLOWERS AND ICE--

29:52.137 --> 29:53.803
WELL, YOU GOT WHAT
YOU WANTED. NOW GO.

29:53.845 --> 29:55.728
WELL, CAN I JUST-- CAN I JUST
SAY ONE THING FIRST?

29:56.025 --> 29:58.372
QUICKLY, WITH YOUR EYES
CLOSED. THIS IS SUCH BAD LUCK.

29:58.671 --> 30:00.367
KIRSTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

30:00.919 --> 30:04.104
THERE--THERE IS NO BAD LUCK
FOR US ANYMORE.

30:04.778 --> 30:08.831
OK? THERE'S NO ACCIDENTS
AND NO MISTAKES.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.158
BECAUSE...

30:11.250 --> 30:13.943
WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW,
IT--IT WIPES THAT ALL AWAY.

30:14.405 --> 30:17.292
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED:

30:17.759 --> 30:18.962
BREAKING UP,

30:19.427 --> 30:20.590
THE CANCER,

30:20.969 --> 30:23.563
PAUL, YOUR PARENTS,

30:24.331 --> 30:27.393
WHATEVER, I MEAN,
IT ALL BROUGHT US RIGHT HERE,

30:28.650 --> 30:32.207
AND THIS IS WHERE
I BELONGED MY WHOLE LIFE.

30:36.646 --> 30:37.966
RIGHT HERE.

30:45.523 --> 30:47.636
UM, COULD YOU MAYBE...

30:48.899 --> 30:50.415
NEVER MIND,
I CAN GET IT.

30:50.459 --> 30:51.533
WHAT?

30:51.726 --> 30:53.509
THE...ZIPPER,
I CAN'T...

30:55.388 --> 30:57.746
SARAH, STOP, STOP.
I GOT IT.

31:02.095 --> 31:03.105
HMM.

31:03.130 --> 31:04.221
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

31:04.246 --> 31:05.824
IT'S STUCK ON YOUR BRA.

31:06.571 --> 31:08.016
I'M TRYING
TO GET IT UNDONE.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.466
BEEN A WHILE, HUH?

31:15.942 --> 31:17.184
I DIDN'T MEAN--

31:17.243 --> 31:18.443
NO, I KNOW.

31:20.241 --> 31:21.981
IT'S THE TRUTH,
THOUGH.

31:23.610 --> 31:24.884
BEEN A LONG WHILE.

31:27.226 --> 31:28.367
YEAH, BUT--

31:28.392 --> 31:30.054
NO,
IT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.695
I HAVE BEEN SUCH
A JERK TO YOU.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.063
NO, I'M THE ONE WHO TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY LOST HER BACKBONE.

31:36.114 --> 31:37.238
-IF I'D ONLY SPOKEN UP--
-I GUESS I KNEW

31:37.263 --> 31:38.635
YOU WEREN'T HAPPY,

31:38.660 --> 31:40.368
SO I FIGURED THAT YOU
WOULDN'T BE IN THE MOOD.

31:40.393 --> 31:41.853
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

32:12.144 --> 32:13.919
OK. DO WE KNOW
WHERE WE WERE GOING?

32:14.630 --> 32:17.845
OH, MAN, WHERE ARE WE?
IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE?

32:18.709 --> 32:20.296
OK, NOW I'M
STARTING TO WORRY.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.538
I LIKED THE BACKYARD
SO MUCH BETTER.

32:23.738 --> 32:24.953
WHERE ARE
THE WOODEN STEPS?

32:24.993 --> 32:26.704
THERE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE WOODEN STEPS.

32:26.891 --> 32:28.164
I DON'T KNOW.

32:29.794 --> 32:31.054
OH, WAIT.
IS THAT?

32:31.079 --> 32:32.374
YEAH, THERE THEY ARE. OVER THERE.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.630
HEY, CLAUD, CAN I GET
THOSE FLOWERS FROM YOU?

32:36.662 --> 32:37.806
YEAH. OH,

32:38.086 --> 32:39.603
YOU GUYS, LOOK
AT ALL THESE CARS.

32:39.628 --> 32:40.909
OK, EVERYBODY'S HERE.

32:41.186 --> 32:43.477
WHAT IF--WHAT IF WE, LIKE,
MISSED THE WHOLE THING?

32:43.510 --> 32:44.808
WHAT IF WE'RE TOO LATE?

32:45.114 --> 32:46.376
RIGHT.

32:51.123 --> 32:52.474
OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

32:52.499 --> 32:53.730
OH, MY GOD.

32:58.574 --> 32:59.774
HEY!

33:00.567 --> 33:01.898
CHARLIE.
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

33:03.473 --> 33:06.412
DAD USED TO KNOW THE LIFEGUARDS
THAT WORKED THIS STATION.

33:06.850 --> 33:09.213
HUNDREDS OF HOURS I
SPENT STARING AT THE SURF FROM HERE.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.249
-WOW.
-WOW.

33:11.274 --> 33:12.295
SO, WHERE'S BAILEY?

33:12.355 --> 33:13.577
OH, THEY SHOULD BE
RIGHT BEHIND US.

33:13.602 --> 33:15.216
THEY WERE IN THEIR ROOM GETTING
DRESSED WHEN WE LEFT.

33:15.729 --> 33:16.815
OK.

33:16.948 --> 33:19.113
SO,
LET'S GET MARRIED.

33:19.479 --> 33:20.694
OK.

33:37.943 --> 33:41.879
(PLAYING THE WEDDING MARCH)

33:55.580 --> 33:57.494
CHARLIE, THIS--
HOW DID YOU--

33:57.519 --> 33:58.669
YOUR TIE IS CROOKED.

33:58.694 --> 34:00.370
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK YOU
IF YOU GOT THE RING.

34:00.395 --> 34:01.726
YEAH.

34:44.356 --> 34:46.727
WE ARE GATHERED HERE
TODAY TO CELEBRATE

34:46.767 --> 34:48.721
ONE OF LIFE'S GREATEST MOMENTS.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.528
TO ADD OUR BEST
HOPES TO THE WORDS

34:51.586 --> 34:54.063
THAT UNITE THESE
TWO IN MARRIAGE,

34:54.088 --> 34:56.802
AND TO JOYOUSLY SERVE
AS WITNESSES...

34:56.854 --> 35:00.632
I, CHARLIE, TAKE YOU, KIRSTEN,
TO BE MY WIFE.

35:01.998 --> 35:05.550
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD, IN
SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH...

35:05.699 --> 35:07.543
FOR RICHER OR FOR POORER,

35:08.235 --> 35:09.831
IN JOY AND IN SORROW.

35:11.372 --> 35:15.305
I PROMISE TO LOVE,
HONOR, AND CHERISH YOU

35:15.684 --> 35:18.002
FOR AS LONG AS
WE BOTH SHALL LIVE.

35:20.175 --> 35:21.583
Minister:
BY THESE VOWS,

35:21.608 --> 35:23.652
THE JOINING OF YOUR HANDS

35:23.949 --> 35:26.235
AND THE GIVING
OF THESE RINGS...

35:29.456 --> 35:32.927
I NOW DECLARE YOU
TO BE HUSBAND AND WIFE.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.464
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:04.308 --> 36:05.895
DOWN THE AISLE.
DOWN THE AISLE.

36:26.675 --> 36:28.068
HERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

36:28.093 --> 36:30.252
WHOA, I GOT TO BRING YOU
MORE SCAMPI.

36:30.302 --> 36:31.375
YOU NEED MORE SCAMPI.

36:31.401 --> 36:32.220
I'M STUFFED.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.084
NO, WITH THE CRYING
AND THE DANCING,

36:34.109 --> 36:36.525
IT'S LIKE WORKING OFF
3 MEALS. COME ON. LET ME.

36:36.550 --> 36:37.552
OK, OK. MORE SCAMPI.

36:37.605 --> 36:39.627
AND YOU NEED MORE LINGUINI.
I'LL GET YOU--

36:39.652 --> 36:41.028
-OH, JOE!
-SCAMPI, OK.

36:41.053 --> 36:42.608
-PASS THE BREAD, PLEASE.
-YEAH.

36:56.444 --> 36:58.475
I TRIED TO STAY OUT
OF YOUR EYE LINE.

36:58.970 --> 36:59.977
MOM--

37:00.002 --> 37:04.182
AND I TRIED TO THINK THE
THOUGHTS THAT YOU WANTED ME TO.

37:05.612 --> 37:07.950
BUT KIRSTEN, YOU HAVE
TO BE FAIR TO ME.

37:08.662 --> 37:11.320
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

37:12.602 --> 37:16.260
I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME
WITH YOU BEING SICK...

37:16.293 --> 37:17.689
THAN BEING WELL.

37:19.177 --> 37:20.375
I KNOW.

37:22.614 --> 37:25.258
I PRAY FOR
YOUR HAPPINESS, KIRSTEN.

37:26.093 --> 37:27.608
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
MOM?

37:28.801 --> 37:30.055
LOOK AT ME.

37:31.538 --> 37:32.871
I'M HAPPY.

37:36.146 --> 37:37.658
YOU SEE? I'M HAPPY.

37:55.031 --> 37:59.086
EVAN STILLMAN CALLED AND
SAID THAT CFA FOUND AN OPENING AND...

37:59.921 --> 38:01.104
SO I'M TRANSFERRING.

38:01.498 --> 38:02.870
I'M GONNA DO
THE BOOK THING.

38:03.056 --> 38:04.704
AH, SO YOU'RE MOVING
BACK TO THE HOUSE?

38:04.937 --> 38:06.830
WHILE I LOOK
FOR MY OWN PLACE, UH-HUH.

38:08.625 --> 38:10.323
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

38:11.607 --> 38:13.315
I DON'T KNOW.
THE THING IS...

38:14.269 --> 38:15.704
EVERYONE...

38:16.592 --> 38:17.860
EVERYONE KEPT
GIVING ME ADVICE.

38:17.907 --> 38:19.743
I WAS ASKING
THE WORLD FOR ADVICE.

38:19.768 --> 38:22.216
AND EVAN SAID ONE THING,
AND YOU SAID ANOTHER,

38:22.265 --> 38:24.394
AND THEN I REALIZED

38:24.813 --> 38:26.375
THE THING ABOUTWRITING
IS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

38:28.145 --> 38:30.254
SO I SAT
IN A QUIET PLACE,

38:30.587 --> 38:32.094
AND I TUNED OUT
THE WORLD

38:32.126 --> 38:35.648
AND TRIED REALLY HARD
TO LISTEN TO THE INNER--

38:35.693 --> 38:37.810
YOU KNOW, JULIA,
AND SHE WAS LIKE,

38:38.587 --> 38:39.604
GET REAL.

38:39.996 --> 38:42.655
FOOL. IT'S A BOOK. HOW OFTEN
IS THAT GONNA COME ALONG?

38:43.072 --> 38:44.216
(LAUGHS)

38:44.797 --> 38:46.492
SHE SOUNDS PRETTY SURE OF HERSELF.

38:47.631 --> 38:49.288
YEAH, SHE IS.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.281
I WISH SHE WAS HERE
MORE OFTEN.

38:51.710 --> 38:54.851
UH, DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S HERE.

38:55.386 --> 38:58.197
I MEAN, SHE WAS ALL OVER IT
FOR LIKE A YEAR.

39:08.237 --> 39:09.529
HEY.

39:10.905 --> 39:12.085
DO YOU WANNA DANCE?

39:13.809 --> 39:15.603
LISTEN, I HEARD
WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY.

39:16.803 --> 39:18.578
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU MADE NO SENSE,

39:18.603 --> 39:21.965
BUT YOUR TIMING...
BASICALLY SUCKED.

39:22.445 --> 39:23.728
CLAUDIA, WAIT--

39:23.753 --> 39:24.854
NO.

39:25.561 --> 39:27.198
CODY,
IT'S MY TIMING, TOO.

39:27.956 --> 39:29.988
IT'S WHERE I AM IN
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

39:30.770 --> 39:33.962
I'M--I'M YOUNGER
THAN YOU, AND, UM,

39:35.527 --> 39:37.183
I'M IN
A DIFFERENT PLACE.

39:39.521 --> 39:41.325
I'M SORRY, CODY,
BUT...

39:42.954 --> 39:45.601
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DANCE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

39:55.948 --> 39:57.446
WHAT'S THAT
NEW MOVE THERE?

39:58.497 --> 39:59.765
WHAT?

40:00.088 --> 40:02.605
WITH YOUR KNEE.
RIGHT...THERE.

40:03.766 --> 40:04.894
NO MOVE.

40:07.393 --> 40:09.007
I GUESS I'M JUST
SENSITIVE, HUH?

40:15.936 --> 40:18.686
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SAID
THERE'S A REALLY GREAT VIEW OF THE COVE

40:18.746 --> 40:20.030
RIGHT BEHIND THAT TENT.

40:20.803 --> 40:21.929
YEAH?

40:22.860 --> 40:25.429
YOU, UM...
WANNA SHOW ME?

40:29.866 --> 40:31.329
GOD, I LOVE WEDDINGS.

40:38.633 --> 40:41.568
UH, BAILEY HAS SOMETHING
TO SAY, I'M SURE.

40:41.630 --> 40:43.272
BUT UNTIL HE'S READY,

40:43.330 --> 40:46.434
I JUST--JUST HAD A COUPLE
OF WORDS OF MY OWN.

40:48.998 --> 40:50.060
I DON'T KNOW IF
THEY'RE LISTENING,

40:50.085 --> 40:54.333
BECAUSE WE'VE--WE'VE CHANGED THE
LOCATION MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES,

40:55.646 --> 40:58.573
BUT I HOPE MOM AND DAD
ARE OUT THERE.

40:59.154 --> 41:02.489
I WANT THEM TO KNOW
A FEW THINGS.

41:03.475 --> 41:05.309
A LOT OF YOU MUST HAVE
WORRIED WHEN THEY LEFT

41:05.334 --> 41:08.457
THAT--THAT THINGS MIGHT NOT
TURN OUT SO WELL FOR US.

41:08.484 --> 41:12.624
THAT...THAT MAYBE WE'D LEARN
THE WRONG LESSONS FROM LOSING THEM.

41:13.297 --> 41:16.215
AND WE'D BE SO SCARED
OF LOSING AGAIN

41:16.240 --> 41:19.862
THAT WE'D... WE'D NEVER
ATTACH OURSELVES TO ANYTHING...

41:20.485 --> 41:21.642
INCLUDING EACH OTHER.

41:23.465 --> 41:26.071
WELL, I--I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR ALL OF US HERE,

41:26.116 --> 41:27.396
BUT I KNOW WHAT I LEARNED.

41:27.648 --> 41:31.347
AND I LEARNED THAT
WHEN SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT TO YOU,

41:31.667 --> 41:33.615
YOU GRAB ON WITH
BOTH HANDS, AND YOU

41:33.675 --> 41:34.965
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT LETTING GO.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.543
LETTING GO
IS NOT AN OPTION.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.950
AND I CAN'T
FORGET THAT NOW

41:41.975 --> 41:45.741
BECAUSE...KIRSTEN,
MY WIFE--

41:47.444 --> 41:49.126
THERE'S A CONCEPT.
HEH HEH.

41:50.225 --> 41:52.558
WOULDN'T BE MY WIFE
FOR ANY OTHER REASON.

41:54.248 --> 41:55.374
SO...

41:56.538 --> 41:58.347
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEXT
FOR US AFTER THIS,

41:58.397 --> 41:59.880
BUT I KNOW THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY

41:59.905 --> 42:03.175
BECAUSE MY...MY PARENTS
LEFT ME THE...

42:04.082 --> 42:05.421
THE SECRET TO LIFE.

42:09.814 --> 42:10.988
MOM AND DAD...

42:12.901 --> 42:14.219
WE NEVER LET GO.

42:16.283 --> 42:17.664
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
WE EVER WILL.

42:19.041 --> 42:20.367
HEAR, HEAR!
BRAVO!

42:20.394 --> 42:21.336
-HEAR, HEAR!
-NICE.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.700
(APPLAUSE)

42:32.538 --> 42:35.861
OK, BACK TO DANCING
AND FESTIVITY!

42:35.950 --> 42:37.504
(LAUGHING)

42:38.862 --> 42:40.424
WE'LL SEE YOU ALL
SO SOON.

42:40.784 --> 42:41.813
WE LOVE YOU.

42:41.866 --> 42:43.111
-LOVE YOU, TOO.
-SEE YA, MAN.

42:52.451 --> 42:53.676
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

42:54.194 --> 42:55.419
WE WILL.
