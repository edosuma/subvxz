20:25.900 --> 20:28.101
So awful
about steve sanner.
Yeah.

20:28.136 --> 20:31.972
Could you, uh, tell us about
your relationship with him?
What do you mean?

20:32.006 --> 20:35.142
Come on, debbie.
You know what I mean.
We have his phone records.

20:35.176 --> 20:37.144
We...Ran into each other.

20:37.178 --> 20:39.146
We had coffee,
a few conversations.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.381
Were you having
an affair?
No.

20:41.415 --> 20:44.784

of course not.

Get out of the car.

20:55.897 --> 20:57.898
Damn it! Do you know
how much this is gonna cost?

20:57.932 --> 20:59.432
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.234
Take it easy.
I'm a private investigator.

21:01.269 --> 21:03.970
Then you know the drill.
Two fingers -- pull some I.D.

21:04.005 --> 21:06.006
Slowly.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.875
I got every right to be here.
You want to lose
the attitude?

21:08.910 --> 21:11.211
We're in the middle
of a homicide investigation.

21:11.245 --> 21:13.880
You're interfering
with a potential witness.
I got nothing to do
with a homicide.

21:13.915 --> 21:16.216
Then why
the paparazzi camera?

21:16.250 --> 21:19.519
It's okay. He's a...
Plant activist, as well.
Okay. Great.

21:19.554 --> 21:22.189
Husband thought she
might be banging someone.
Hired me to sit on her.

21:22.223 --> 21:24.858
Did you find proof?
Yeah.
Two different guys.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.893
Let me see it.

Who is he?
I don't know.

21:44.946 --> 21:47.581
All right. We're gonna need
your memory card.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.950
Yeah, yeah, or you'll charge me
with obstruction.

I have to go get these plants
watered and fertilized.

22:04.966 --> 22:06.433
We have a few more questions,
debbie.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.969
I don't know anything,
and I called our lawyer.

22:09.003 --> 22:11.871
[ engine turns over ]
and he says I don't have to talk
to you. I'm sorry, jane.

22:15.243 --> 22:18.545
The whole school knew
about it the day she
lost her virginity.

22:18.579 --> 22:22.182
Hmm. That mean you think
she's hiding something?
Oh, yeah.

22:26.654 --> 22:28.321
It all sounds good.

22:28.356 --> 22:31.024
It's just...
A surprise, you know?

22:33.894 --> 22:36.963
He moved away
five years ago.

22:36.998 --> 22:38.331
I know.

22:38.366 --> 22:43.036
It's all different now.
I'm different.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.905
I don't need much
to get it off the ground.

22:45.940 --> 22:48.575
Research is all here
for you to look at.

22:48.609 --> 22:50.210
How is he?

22:50.244 --> 22:53.580
He's...
[ sighs ] he's 16.

22:53.614 --> 22:55.115
Hmm.

22:55.149 --> 22:57.984
Tough age.

22:58.019 --> 22:59.452
I'd like to see him.

22:59.487 --> 23:01.621
I'll tell him that.

23:01.656 --> 23:05.392
You and I divorced.
I did not divorce him.

23:05.426 --> 23:09.162
It didn't work out the way
I'd hoped with his dad.

23:09.196 --> 23:12.098
I'm here for him.
I have always been here for him.

23:13.567 --> 23:18.972
Think about whether you
could ever be here for me again.

23:25.346 --> 23:27.347
Angela:
She's lovely.

23:28.582 --> 23:32.085
Wants to open a yoga studio.
She wants me to invest.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.255
[ chuckles ]
I always wanted to learn yoga.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.458
Did a class with her at lunch.
It's harder than it looks.
[ chuckles ]

23:38.492 --> 23:42.095
So you get a nice space
with good energy

23:42.129 --> 23:44.097
And some tinkly music.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.533
[ chuckles ]
I'd go.

[ sighs ] I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

23:57.345 --> 23:59.646
But I sort of feel sorry
for emily.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.615
Adolescence
is such a volatile time.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.985
It probably wasn't easy
for her, either.

24:06.020 --> 24:08.488
Oh, it was easy for her
thanks to those boobs you saw

24:08.522 --> 24:10.957
That arrived special delivery
when she was 12.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.660
Although large breasts
can cause back pain
and severe sciatica.

24:13.694 --> 24:17.530
Well, turns out they
can't protect you
from the pain of life.

24:17.565 --> 24:20.533
She said their marriage
was perfect. Not anymore.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.268
Oh, I don't think
it's been perfect for a while.

on his fingernails --

24:31.011 --> 24:32.412
Another stress indicator.

24:32.446 --> 24:35.181
Something was causing him
enormous anxiety.

One of the most easygoing guys
I've ever met.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.054

24:41.088 --> 24:44.391
Aww. He misses you.
How romantic.

24:44.425 --> 24:48.027
Not so much. It's more like
skype-us-interruptus.

24:48.062 --> 24:50.530
Like coitus interruptus.
I get it.

24:50.564 --> 24:53.233
Should I knock?
What have you got?

24:53.267 --> 24:56.403

25:10.084 --> 25:13.353
It appears to be

and leaned forward.

I don't believe this.

I'm so, so sorry.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.490
I don't understand.

25:33.524 --> 25:35.659
Did your wife seem troubled
about anything?

25:35.693 --> 25:36.960
Yes.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.462
The last few weeks
were terrible.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.698
She was like
a different person.

We know about
the private investigator

to follow her.

Debbie was suddenly
so secretive.

at the reunion?

25:58.583 --> 26:00.517
No, of course not.
I didn't know what to do. I...

26:00.551 --> 26:02.719
Just...

26:02.753 --> 26:04.854
Didn't want to lose her.

26:04.889 --> 26:08.325
You understand that we'll
have to dig into your life

26:08.359 --> 26:09.826
To make sure that's true.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.929
That's okay, jane.
I understand.

26:12.964 --> 26:14.798
Do you know
who this is?

No.

in high school, eddie.

injury around the ligature

of the noose.

would do -- "no."

26:58.342 --> 26:59.976
Not a suicide.

She was strangled by the rope
and posed in the chair.

bringing eddie in after all.

to stick with anything.

27:24.835 --> 27:26.469
Maybe she's changed.

27:26.504 --> 27:28.805
By acknowledging her change,
you let go of past anger

over 700 names.

as the cause of death?

31:19.528 --> 31:23.197
Damn. 118 deaths
across the country.

31:23.231 --> 31:25.132
We can't assume that if
they died of heart attack

31:25.167 --> 31:26.634
It's because they had
a defective valve.

31:26.668 --> 31:28.002
I never assume.

31:28.036 --> 31:30.671
Were any of them

This is charles gordon's valve.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.119
This is
rene watkins' valve.

31:45.153 --> 31:48.455
Both have similar fractures
along the outflow strut.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.090
So they're both
defective?
Yes.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.225
You think the higher-ups
at the company

Knew their valves
were failing?

31:52.661 --> 31:55.629
They've seen the same reports
we're looking at.

The serial numbers
on the valve.

the serial number

Steve knew they were making
defective valves,

32:18.220 --> 32:20.187
And he knew one
was in maria.

32:20.222 --> 32:21.288
That's why
he was calling her.

32:21.323 --> 32:23.257
To warn her.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.460
So, steve told debbie

32:26.494 --> 32:28.462
Because she was
the only journalist he knew.

32:28.496 --> 32:30.397
But debbie,

32:30.432 --> 32:32.132
Wasn't exactly
mike wallace,

to her friend jared,

The investigative
reporter.

32:35.403 --> 32:36.704
But someone figured out

32:36.738 --> 32:38.539
That steve was about to
spill his guts.

32:38.573 --> 32:41.141
And if word of
the defective valves got out,

No big corporate sale.

And here I thought clay courts
were made of clay.

matched the sample

to arrest him.

him in just so I can say hi.

you didn't mention the fact

That you're selling your company

for a flawed valve design?

40:09.307 --> 40:10.974
And debbie tibbet.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.609
You what?

40:12.644 --> 40:14.111
You weren't gonna
take care of it.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.512
You didn't even bother
to look at

40:15.547 --> 40:17.614
Your stupid football bro's
laptop until I showed you.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.484
Oh, boo-hoo.
We're making broken valves.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.219
Why don't we all cry about it
like little girls

40:22.253 --> 40:23.420
And take down the company?

40:23.455 --> 40:24.588
He wasn't gonna talk!

40:24.622 --> 40:26.457
Cuff him.

40:26.491 --> 40:28.125
Wait, what?

40:28.159 --> 40:29.893
You're under arrest for
the murder of maria korkman.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.629
Maria korkman?
The fat chick from high school?

40:32.664 --> 40:34.631
No, the preschool teacher who
died from one of your valves,

40:34.666 --> 40:36.200
The first of many
of your victims,

40:36.234 --> 40:39.269
Which is
second-degree murder...Babe.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.539
Let's go.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.643
Maura:
When you invited me to play,

40:46.678 --> 40:48.512
I thought you meant
on actual courts.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.381
This is how I used to play
when I was a kid.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.250
We can go to my club.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.418
They have
fresh mint lemonade.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.286
Free refills?
Yes!

40:56.321 --> 40:58.021
No!

40:59.324 --> 41:01.458
[ snickers ]

41:01.493 --> 41:05.129
So, um, casey called
this morning again.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.597
Oh.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.966
And I got those little
butterflies in my stomach

41:09.000 --> 41:10.334
Like I was 17 again.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.636
Release of epinephrine.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.104
Draws blood
away from the stomach

41:14.139 --> 41:16.106
And sends it
to the muscles.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.942
You are lovesick.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.077
Wh...

41:20.111 --> 41:21.478
The one who misses it
gets it.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.213
Lovesick?
Run.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.948
It might balance
high dopamine

41:24.983 --> 41:26.617
And norepinephrine levels
present

41:26.651 --> 41:28.152
Because of your inability
to consummate.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.120
Stop. I'll --
I'll get the ball.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.189
I'll race you for it.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.423
[ both laugh ]
