[ Men ] Burn! Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!

00:09.301 --> 00:11.595
Hey!
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!

00:11.678 --> 00:14.890
Burn! Burn! Burn! Yeah. Cool.
What are you guys burning?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.392
Bunch of garbage
that's just taking up space.

00:17.518 --> 00:21.146
No, goddamn it! Wait. Frank, why are
you burning our photo album pictures?

00:21.230 --> 00:23.607
What do you mean?
Because it's trash.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.275
You kidding me?
Oh, my God.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.986
Dude, these are all the pictures
from our Jersey Shore vacations.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.530
You were gonna burn these?
Yeah.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.240
These were like
the happiest days of our lives.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.367
Oh, come on.
Jersey Shore sucked.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.702
The Shore didn't suck, Frank.
You sucked, okay?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.704
You just complained the whole
time and ruined it for everyone else.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.415
Yeah, because I had to do all
the work. | never got to relax.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.125
| would love to go
on a vacation.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.378
Oh, my God. Me too.
| would love to go on a vacation.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.879
Yeah, but not
to the Jersey Shore though.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.714
That place sounds
like a nightmare.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.384
- What's wrong with the Jersey Shore?
- You've seen that TV show.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.511
It's just a bunch
of sweaty guidos...

00:52.594 --> 00:55.806
getting hopped up on energy drinks
and giving each other diseases.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.391
The Jersey Shore
is nothing like that.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.685
It's a magical place
where people swim in the ocean...

00:59.768 --> 01:02.437
and they get to ride on fun rides
and they get to have their first kiss.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.524
- Dude, you would love it.
- Well, hang on a second. I've never seen the ocean.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.694
|- I could get into that if you guys
wanna go down to the Shore.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.195
- [ Denni
Lo is ] Aw, yes!

01:10.279 --> 01:12.197
- We should all go to the Shore together.
- I'll tell you what.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.534
Maybe I'll knock myself out
and we'll head down to the Shore.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.744
Yeah, but I feel like you're just gonna screw
it up if you try and knock yourself out.

01:17.869 --> 01:21.123
You're probably gonna come to halfway there
and then complain the rest of the time.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.874
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I take the rag?

01:22.958 --> 01:25.460
I'll get the chloroform. I'll get
you when you least expect it.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.087
All right, sweet.
Yeah?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.548
Yeah! Going down
to the Jersey Shore!

01:29.631 --> 01:31.133
Yeah, going to
the Shore, baby!

01:31.216 --> 01:33.719
Now, this ocean— explain
it to me. It goes on forever?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.137
[ Grunts ]
[ Mutters ]

01:35.262 --> 01:37.514
Go to sleep. Go
to sleep. [ Grunts ]

02:03.665 --> 02:05.667
So I woke up, like,
halfway there,

02:05.751 --> 02:07.669
and then you just
snuffed me out again, huh, Mac?

02:07.753 --> 02:10.589
Oh, this place turned
into a major shithole.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.674
It does not look exactly the
way | remember it looking.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.593
[ Dee ] No, it's
different. It's different.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.971
The guy at the front desk said there was a
meth lab explosion, so the hotel burned down.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.473
They had to rebuild it.
Something like that.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.475
- There's a smell too, like—
- Don't sweat it, you guys.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.102
With any luck at all, we won't
be spending any time here,

02:24.227 --> 02:26.772
Yes! so just think of
it more like a locker.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.274
I"m sorry. Is no one
gonna talk about Dee's hair?

02:29.358 --> 02:31.318
| was waiting to pounce. | just
didn't know what our cue was.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.528
| was waiting for Dennis
to jump on top of it.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.238
And then we were
gonna slay her. Yeah.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.949
No, no. It's fine. All the cool girls
get their hair braided at the Shore.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.910
| think she looks like Bo
Derek. Thank you, Dennis.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.537
Mm-hmm. Dee and I have some
very fond memories of the Shore.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.414
We're not gonna have you
sullying those great memories...

02:44.539 --> 02:46.083
with all your goddamn
insults. Mm-mmm.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.709
Are you
drinking sunscreen?

02:47.793 --> 02:51.338
No, no. It's a decoy. We're drinking
tequila out of sunscreen bottles.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.049
Very strict open container laws
here at the Jersey Shore.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.634
Cheers.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.013
Holy shit!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.516
Is that the ocean? [ Dee ] Yep.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.601
Yeah, buddy,
that's the ocean.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.603
What's on the other side
of it there?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.105
Europe.
Yeah.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.272
How long would it take—

03:09.398 --> 03:10.941
Do not try
and swim to Europe.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.151
Don't swim to Europe.
[ Frank ] Do not.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.653
Why don't you stick
with Dee and I...

03:14.736 --> 03:16.655
because we can show you the
ropes here at the Jersey Shore.

03:16.738 --> 03:20.033
All right, everybody,
you know what time it is!

03:20.117 --> 03:21.660
Let's go strut
the beach.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.912
Not struttin' shit.
No beach struttin' for me.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.373
I'm gonna find a place
to relax and unwind.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
- [ Mac ] Frank, I'm with you.
- [ Frank ] Yeah.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.044
Grab us some booze. I'll go down to the
beach and get us some prime real estate...

03:31.128 --> 03:33.004
before those gorilla
dickheads get down there.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.172
Yeah.
[ All Laughing ]

03:34.297 --> 03:37.092
Gonna relax. Let's do
it! Let's get out of here.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.930
[ Dee ] Oh, man, this ocean
breeze feels so good on my scalp.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.808
Yeah, it feels awesome.
The sand feels good beneath my feet.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.643
Uh-huh.
I'm a little curious...

03:46.768 --> 03:49.396
as to where all the people
are though. No idea. No idea.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.732
Didn't want to say anything. Didn't want
to ruin the mood, but where are the people?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.817
I'm seeing a lot more dogs
than people, right?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.361
[ Dennis ]
There are a shit ton of dogs out here.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.530
Where are their masters? | don't
think these dogs have masters.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.240
| think these dogs
play by their own rules.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.701
Well, clearly, the action
has shifted elsewhere.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.871
Wanna go to the boardwalk?
Hey, let's go to the boardwalk!

04:05.954 --> 04:06.872
Yeah!
Yes!

04:06.955 --> 04:08.039
Hey, Charlie!
Charlie!

04:08.165 --> 04:10.083
Come here!
[ Laughs ]

04:10.167 --> 04:13.336
Dude! Oh, my God!
This place is amazing!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.504
Right?
Yeah!

04:14.588 --> 04:17.257
And the sunblock drink?
Nice, guys.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.469
They're really good. They're really
good. Thing is, I didn't make you one.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.971
Oh!

04:23.054 --> 04:25.432
Jesus Christ, Charlie.
You're drinking sunblock.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.018
It's good. It gets you— It
gets you all- [ Groaning ]

04:28.101 --> 04:30.437
Yeah, you're ingesting viscous
chemicals, and they're getting you high.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.189
It doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter. Doesn't matter.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.608
<i>We're going 10 the boardwalk.
What do you say? Oh, really?</i>

04:34.733 --> 04:36.318
You wanna leave?
Yeah.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.862
| feel like we're just scratching the
surface of all the cool shit out here.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.363
What cool shit?

04:40.447 --> 04:43.325
Well, the sea specimens,
the stray dogs,

04:43.408 --> 04:46.036
the trash that floated
over from Europe.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.414
Yeah, but we didn't come here to
play with stray dogs and trash, man.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.124
We came here
to soak up the culture.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.044
And the boardwalk is the cultural center
of the Jersey Shore, so let's go there.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.921
Come on, man!
Yeah, all right.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.547
Going
to the boardwalk.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.266
Yo, Mac,

05:08.350 --> 05:11.812
you see that sign there
that says “Toxic Spill”?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.563
<i>Yeah.
What's that?</i>

05:13.647 --> 05:15.857
Disregard that, Frank.
It's a bunch of liberal bullshit.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.610
Right. Right. This is a
nice spot. Yeah, yeah.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.321
Whoa! What's that? You
were supposed to get booze.

05:21.404 --> 05:25.116
Oh, this is ham
soaked in rum.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.202
It is loaded with booze.

05:27.285 --> 05:31.081
Goddamn it, Frank, eating
your drinks? That is genius!

05:31.206 --> 05:32.415
Ow! [ Laughs ] What?

05:32.499 --> 05:33.875
What the—

05:33.959 --> 05:35.836
What the— What is that?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.255
Oh, yeah.
| got stuck with a needle.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.508
Yeah, that's a syringe. Be
careful. They are everywhere.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.427
The beach is full of syringes.
Why is that?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.638
Well, we're in the steroid
capital of the world, Frank.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.516
To be honest with you,
as a man who works very hard...

05:49.599 --> 05:53.311
to maintain a certain level of physical
excellence, | find shortcuts insulting.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.272
Now give me a piece of ham now.
[ Chuckles ]

05:55.355 --> 05:57.941
Hey, check that out. What—

05:58.066 --> 06:00.235
What the hell"s a dog doing here?
Hey, get out of here!

06:00.360 --> 06:01.778
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

06:01.862 --> 06:03.572
Goddamn dogs.
I'm telling you, dude.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.990
The were lurking before.
Now they're swarming.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.701
I'm not sharing my ham
with no dogs.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.494
| got a great idea.

06:11.288 --> 06:16.251
Hey, warm sun,
cool ocean breezes,

06:16.376 --> 06:19.170
getting ripshit on ham.
[ Laughs ]

06:19.254 --> 06:21.506
Might you say
we're getting “hammered”?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.342
Oh! Nice one.
[ Laughs ]

06:24.426 --> 06:27.387
This was a great
idea, Frank. Great idea.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.889
This is 90-proof ham.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.348
Screw you, mutts!

06:30.432 --> 06:32.976
[ Barking ]

06:35.729 --> 06:37.898
Get out of here, you bitch!
Come and get it.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.984
Stupid dogs. We outsmarted
those dogs, Frank. [ Laughs ]

06:42.611 --> 06:44.571
- Dude, this is the boardwalk, man.
- Yeah!

06:44.654 --> 06:46.156
This is amazing.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.074
It's a little bit more desolate
than I was hoping it would be.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.576
Yeah, but that's okay.
It's still really great.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.870
Charlie, there's all kinds
of rides and games...

06:51.953 --> 06:53.496
and opportunities
to win stuffed toys.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.999
Yeah, man, the boardwalk
is a blast, man.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.752
But it is under the boardwalk
where the action really happens.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.003
Trust me, pal.
Oh, yeah?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.755
Yeah.
Oh, what's down there?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.506
Oh, Charlie, come on.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.427
So under the boardwalk's
where it's at, huh? Yeah, man.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.554
This is gonna knock
your socks off.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.890
You never know who you're gonna
run into, what they're gonna be doing.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.433
You love the bridge, right?
Yeah.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.101
This is a lot like being under
the bridge, | would think.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.645
It's way better than that.
Yeah?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.271
<i>Under the boardwalk
is a magical place, man.</i>

07:18.355 --> 07:20.440
| have a special place in my heart
"cause I had my first kiss down here.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.733
Mm-hmm.
Did you?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.444
Dude, all kinds of romantic
shit happens— [ Gasps ]

07:24.527 --> 07:26.696
[ Charlie ]
Oh, God! Oh, God!

07:26.780 --> 07:28.657
[ All Yelling ]

07:28.740 --> 07:30.408
Oh, no! No! No!

07:30.533 --> 07:32.160
No! What was that?
No!

07:32.285 --> 07:34.788
Two homeless guys
banging each other. | saw.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.082
But why? That's not
magical. That's not romantic.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.750
That's your idea
of romantic? No!

07:38.833 --> 07:41.252
There are other kinds of
romances that happen under here.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.254
| don't wanna see
anything else like that.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.924
You know what? I'm out of here.
'Cause you guys are perverted.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.176
You get out of here.
You get out of here, Charlie.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.386
Aw!
Son of a bitch.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.771
[ Groans ]

08:03.233 --> 08:05.110
Where's the beach?
Frank, wake up!

08:05.235 --> 08:07.237
What? What's the
matter? Where's the beach?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.075
Uh— Uh, I don't know.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.160
We're in the middle
of the goddamn ocean!

08:14.244 --> 08:17.706
Yes, we are.
[ Laughing ]

08:17.831 --> 08:21.418
What are we gonna do? Well,
we're gonna conk out for a while...

08:21.501 --> 08:24.587
and let the current
gently roll us back to shore.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.049
Frank, the current is what
brought us out here in the first place.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.177
If anything, we should be paddling
against it to get back to the beach.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.096
I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear that.

08:33.179 --> 08:38.058
Frank— Frank, we are no longer in
relaxing mode. We are now in survival mode.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.729
Will you stop being so dramatic?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.774
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.943
Where's the rum ham?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.987
Wha-
Where's the rum-—

08:49.070 --> 08:50.864
- Ah!
-[Yelling ]

08:50.947 --> 08:52.157
Rum ham!

08:52.282 --> 08:54.075
No, Frank. Stay in
the boat. Rum ham!

08:54.200 --> 08:57.162
Frank, stay in the boat!
Oh, rum ham!

08:57.245 --> 08:59.539
I'm sorry, rum ham.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.375
I'm sorry, rum ham.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.086
Oh, rum ham.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.925
- Yeah, this is gonna be great, right?
- Of course it is.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.512
Nothing like some good, innocent,
wholesome, above-the-boardwalk fun...

09:14.637 --> 09:17.724
to, uh, get us
back on track. Yes.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.478
Take a step back from the
situation, get a clearer perspective.
