Announcer:
Live from the Springfield Center

01:22.910 --> 01:24.220
for the Performing Arts

01:24.280 --> 01:25.850
The wrestling match
of the century.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.110
Today, Rasputin,
the friendly Russian.

01:29.180 --> 01:30.880
Didn't he used to be
the mad Russian?

01:30.950 --> 01:34.080
Yes, but I'm afraid
the forces of history
have changed wrestling...

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
perhaps forever.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.320
And the challenger

01:36.390 --> 01:37.760
from the University
of Heidelberg

01:37.830 --> 01:40.700
Professor Werner Von Brawn.
That's Brawn with a 'W'.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.260
Two titans at the height
of their careers.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.470
If you ask me

01:44.530 --> 01:46.530
this is going to be
one hell of a match.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.540
Oh Bart, I hope you're
not taking this seriously.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.280
Even a five-year-old knows

01:51.340 --> 01:53.340
that this is as choreographed
as any ballet.

01:53.410 --> 01:54.250
Homer: Rasputin's got

01:54.310 --> 01:55.280
the reach

01:55.340 --> 01:56.740
but on the other hand,

01:56.810 --> 01:58.580
the Professor's
got his patented
"coma lock."

01:58.650 --> 02:01.590
If you ask me,
this is gonna be
one hell of a match.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.790
Moe: <i>Oh, look
at that show-off.</i>

02:03.850 --> 02:06.980
Kissing his own muscles. Bull!

02:07.060 --> 02:08.030
( <i>burping )</i>

02:08.090 --> 02:09.490
Rasputin is spinning
the Professor

02:09.560 --> 02:10.630
like an auto-gyro.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.020
That's got to be
disorienting.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.090
Hey, Milhouse, crank it up.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.890
Hey, that's <i>my seat.</i>

02:18.970 --> 02:20.810
Correction:
<i>was your seat.</i>

02:20.870 --> 02:23.580
But I only got up
to go to the can.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.910
Hey, I don't see your name
engraved on this bar stool.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.050
One... two... three...

02:29.110 --> 02:31.150
four... five... six...

02:31.210 --> 02:33.680
seven... eight... nine...

02:33.750 --> 02:38.190
The ref is issuing
a warning to Rasputin.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.150
Crowd:
Boo!
( clank )

02:39.220 --> 02:41.290
Announcer:
Oh, my, oh, my!

02:41.360 --> 02:44.360
Why is the referee
permitting this?

02:44.430 --> 02:47.870
Crowd:
Boo! Boo! Hiss!
( bell rings )

02:47.930 --> 02:51.200
Boo! Hiss! Boo!

02:51.270 --> 02:53.440
Boo! Boo!

02:53.500 --> 02:54.940
<i>This Saturday,
for one night only,</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:56.760
your life will
be changed forever.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.680
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

02:58.740 --> 03:00.550
at the Springfield Speedway--

03:00.610 --> 03:01.450
Don "Crusher" Woodard!

03:01.510 --> 03:02.450
John "The Skunk" Tremaine!

03:02.510 --> 03:03.480
And the Team Kamaratsu

03:03.550 --> 03:04.820
dirt-riding dunk-masters

03:04.880 --> 03:07.120
at the year's biggest
monster truck rally!

03:07.180 --> 03:08.140
One night only.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.290
Plus the amazing

03:09.350 --> 03:11.260
the astounding,
the unbelievable--

03:11.320 --> 03:12.590
Truckasaurus!

03:12.650 --> 03:15.550
20 tons and four stories
of car-crunching

03:15.620 --> 03:18.190
fire-breathing,
prehistoric insanity!

03:18.260 --> 03:19.530
Whoa!
Whoa!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.800
One night only
at the Springfield Speedway

03:21.860 --> 03:23.520
This Saturday.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.940
If you miss this,
you'd better be dead
or in jail.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.270
And if you're in jail,
break out!

03:29.340 --> 03:30.640
Be there! Be there!
( echoes )

03:30.710 --> 03:32.440
Be there!

03:32.510 --> 03:33.340
( tires squeal )

03:40.220 --> 03:41.220
Truckasaurus!
Truckasaurus!

03:44.120 --> 03:44.990
( glass clinking )

03:46.690 --> 03:49.260
I have an announcement to make.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.850
As a family growth thing,
Bart and I think
we should all go

03:51.930 --> 03:54.570
to the monster truck rally
this Saturday.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.470
Aren't you forgetting
something?

03:56.530 --> 03:57.600
Uh...

03:57.670 --> 03:59.540
Monster truck rally...

03:59.600 --> 04:00.340
growth thing...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.360
No, I don't think so.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.810
Lisa's recital
is Saturday night.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.670
I'll be playing
my first solo.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.180
If you miss it on Saturday

04:07.240 --> 04:09.870
I advise you to start looking
for a child therapist on Sunday.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.380
But Truckasaurus
is one night only!

04:12.450 --> 04:16.089
Oh, cruel fate,
why do you mock me?

04:16.149 --> 04:17.089
( <i>crying )
( <i>crying )</i></i>

04:17.149 --> 04:18.480
Now come on,
you two.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.220
What time does your little
truck game start?

04:21.290 --> 04:23.660
8:00, but what does it matter?

04:23.730 --> 04:26.460
<i>Well, Lisa's recital
starts at 5:00.</i>

04:26.530 --> 04:27.570
<i>We can go to both.
( gasps )</i>

04:27.630 --> 04:29.470
Marge, you're a genius.

04:31.030 --> 04:33.660
People, let's have
good assembly manners, please.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.610
People. People!

04:36.670 --> 04:38.680
Quiet down now, please.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.050
Don't make me flick
the lights on and off.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.680
Thank you.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.670
Ladies, gentlemen,
parents and music lovers.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.050
Welcome to the first

04:47.120 --> 04:48.550
in a series
of Saturday evening concerts.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.290
Series?

04:49.350 --> 04:49.990
Ohhh!

04:50.050 --> 04:52.190
Tonight, Sherbert's...

04:52.250 --> 04:54.850
Schubert's <i>Unfinished Symphony.</i>

04:54.920 --> 04:57.490
Oh good. Unfinished. This
shouldn't take long.
( groans )

04:57.560 --> 05:00.230
( tapping )
Remember, children.
Stay together.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.270
Five, six, seven

05:01.330 --> 05:02.300
eight...

05:02.360 --> 05:06.160
( <i>playing Unfinished Symphony )</i>

05:13.740 --> 05:15.540
( <i>saxophone solo )</i>

05:26.490 --> 05:28.160
That was beautiful.
<i>( solo continues )</i>

05:28.220 --> 05:29.620
Can we go now?

05:29.690 --> 05:31.230
Sit down, Homer.
Grrr!

05:34.300 --> 05:37.030
How much longer was Sherbert
planning on making

05:37.100 --> 05:38.840
this piece of junk?

05:38.900 --> 05:41.410
Oh, my, Lisa was wonderful.

05:41.470 --> 05:43.140
She certainly has come a long
way with her fingering.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.980
Thanks, Flanders.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.380
Big know-it-all.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.610
When's
Todd's solo, Dad?

05:47.680 --> 05:48.350
Shh.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.450
It's coming up, son.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.280
It's coming up.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.480
( <i>violin solo begins )</i>

06:00.920 --> 06:03.650
( <i>sniffling )</i>

06:03.730 --> 06:06.630
My son, my son.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.870
Come on, Flanders.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.070
He's not that bad.

06:10.130 --> 06:13.270
( <i>playing "1812 Overture" )</i>

06:35.160 --> 06:39.330
( <i>applause )</i>

06:39.390 --> 06:42.960
( <i>Homer humming
"1812 Overture"
and honking )</i>

06:45.030 --> 06:45.890
I reached him.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.510
Homer, drive defensively.

06:47.570 --> 06:50.440
Sometime's the best defense
is a good offense.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.510
Faster, Dad.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.900
Bart:
<i>Truckasaurus awaits.</i>

06:56.010 --> 06:57.720
Homer:
Damn, no spots.

06:57.780 --> 07:00.590
Oh, I think there's
one over there.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.420
( <i>crowd yelling )</i>

07:07.920 --> 07:09.020
Dad?

07:09.090 --> 07:10.930
Not now, Lisa.

07:10.990 --> 07:11.950
Come on.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.000
Homer?

07:13.060 --> 07:13.830
<i>What?!</i>

07:13.900 --> 07:15.000
It's Truckasaurus!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.560
Where? Where?

07:16.630 --> 07:18.100
( <i>screaming )</i>

07:34.980 --> 07:36.640
Pull, you dogs.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.320
Mechanic:
Let's see here.

07:38.390 --> 07:39.990
Cracked windshield,
melted bumpers

07:40.060 --> 07:45.930
punctured radiator,
teeth marks on the trunk...

07:45.990 --> 07:47.490
On the plus side

07:47.560 --> 07:49.390
there doesn't seem to be
any frame damage.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.530
This check should
take care of everything.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.540
Thank you so much.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.440
Mrs. Simpson? I'm Leo G. Clark,
inventor, owner and operator
of Truckasaurus.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.410
Let me just say that,
Truckasaurus feels very badly
about what happened

08:01.480 --> 08:04.580
and everyone here at Team
Truckasaurus would like you to

08:04.650 --> 08:08.020
enjoy this half bottle of
domestic champagne for being
such good sports.

08:08.080 --> 08:13.350
Mmm. Well thank you. Gee,
everyone's so nice here at the
Monster Truck Rally.

08:13.420 --> 08:18.560
Look Homer, champagne!
Eeeeegh!

08:18.630 --> 08:22.670
Announcer:
<i>And now, Majestic Undercoating
is proud to present:</i>

08:22.730 --> 08:25.440
<i>Ms. Monster!</i>

08:25.500 --> 08:27.510
Wow, a woman mud-pull driver.

08:27.570 --> 08:31.180
Another barrier broken.
Ride on, sister!

08:32.039 --> 08:33.980
Let the destruction begin!

08:34.039 --> 08:37.100
Hey, they forgot
my corn dog.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.919
Give me some nachos,
Homersaurus.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.620
Here you go, Bartasaurus.

Announcer:
<i>For our last event
of the evening,</i>

08:46.350 --> 08:48.420
<i>the world's greatest daredevil.</i>

08:48.490 --> 08:51.200
<i>The man who's
no stranger to danger.</i>

08:58.900 --> 09:03.140
Ladies and gentlemen

09:03.210 --> 09:04.910
I'm glad you're all here
to witness

09:04.970 --> 09:08.400
what may very well be
my grisly death.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.680
Tonight, my most
dangerous stunt.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.620
I will death defy
both nature and gravity

09:13.680 --> 09:15.990
by leaping over
this tank of water

09:16.050 --> 09:18.620
<i>filled with man-eating
great white sharks</i>

09:18.690 --> 09:20.860

<i>and perhaps the most
frightening of all</i>

09:26.930 --> 09:31.000
<i>the king of the jungle,
one ferocious lion.</i>

09:31.070 --> 09:31.940
Ohh!
Ohh!

09:32.000 --> 09:33.200
Oh, and...

09:33.270 --> 09:34.640
( <i>laughing )</i>

09:34.700 --> 09:36.160
I almost forgot.

09:36.240 --> 09:41.680
To add a real element of danger,
one drop of human blood.

09:44.580 --> 09:48.690
And on chance I don't survive,
let me just say:

09:48.750 --> 09:52.690
seat belts save lives,
so buckle up.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.190
This is so cool.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.530
I can't watch.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.950
He made it!

<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

<i>The world's greatest daredevil,

Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

11:00.560 --> 11:03.190
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

11:03.260 --> 11:05.130
Bart, Bart.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.490
We're home, son.

11:08.830 --> 11:12.170
Dad, I want to be a daredevil.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.700
Kids say
such stupid things.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.410
You're crazy,
Bart.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.110
You're never gonna make it.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.380
Spare me your lectures, ladies.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.460
Oh, no, he's hurt.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.860
Bad.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.160
Let's get
out of here.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.740
Oh, my little boy.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.780
Come on Marge,
we're mad at him.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.710
Are you all right?

11:51.770 --> 11:52.700
Better than all right.

11:52.770 --> 11:54.740
I got stitches.

11:54.810 --> 11:55.680
Eww.
Eww.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.400
Probably
a scar too.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.280
Mrs. Simpson, Bart tells me
he injured himself

12:00.350 --> 12:01.920
training for a career
in death defiance?

12:01.980 --> 12:05.650
Yes, well we saw
a daredevil last night

12:05.720 --> 12:08.430
and you know,
monkey see, monkey do.

12:08.490 --> 12:11.260
I think I know something
that might discourage him

12:11.330 --> 12:13.060
from this sort of behavior.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.630
Bart, in this ward
are the children

12:14.700 --> 12:16.900
who have been hurt
by imitating stunts

12:16.970 --> 12:18.440
they saw on television

12:18.500 --> 12:19.800
movies and legitimate stage.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.980
This little boy broke his leg
trying to fly like Superman.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.400
This boy's brother

12:29.480 --> 12:31.280
hit him in the head
with a wrench

12:31.350 --> 12:34.320
mimicking a recent
TV wrestling match.

12:34.380 --> 12:38.310
I won't even subject you
to the horrors of our
Three Stooges ward.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.630
Gee, I never realized TV
was such a dangerous
influence.

12:41.690 --> 12:44.060
As tragic as all this is

12:44.130 --> 12:46.230
it's a small price to pay
for countless hours

12:46.290 --> 12:47.790
of top-notch entertainment.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.160
Amen, huh, Bart?

12:49.230 --> 12:51.100
Has Dr. Hibbert
made his point?

12:51.170 --> 12:52.670
He certainly has, Dad.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.690
I learned a real
lesson here today.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.270
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.480
Umph!

13:06.510 --> 13:07.840
I did it.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.320
Wow!
All right!

13:11.720 --> 13:12.760
( <i>cheering )
Cool!</i>

13:12.820 --> 13:13.990
Way happening, Bart.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.230
Awesome!

13:16.290 --> 13:16.860
Man, you're the king.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.330
That was so cool.

13:18.390 --> 13:21.260
Thank you. How about a hand for
these brave little animals.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.570
Hi, kids.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.770
Thanks.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.640
Okay, field trippers,
off the bus.

13:33.710 --> 13:35.750
What's the matter, Bart?

13:35.810 --> 13:39.150
Aw, I'm runnin' on empty,
Milhouse. You kids get a kick
out of my jumps

13:39.210 --> 13:42.740
and I love you for it,
but it's all too easy.

13:42.820 --> 13:46.620
There has got to be
a challenge out there
worthy of me.

13:46.690 --> 13:47.830
Hello, children

13:47.890 --> 13:50.160
and welcome
to Springfield Gorge.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.830
Bart:
Wow!

13:51.890 --> 13:53.920
Man, this thing's
pretty gnarly.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.900
I bet you could throw
a dead body in there

13:55.960 --> 13:57.730
and no one would ever find it.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.840
Otto, I'm going
to leap over
Springfield Gorge

13:59.900 --> 14:02.340
on my
skateboard.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.430
Bart, as the only adult here,
I feel I should say something.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.280
What?

14:07.340 --> 14:09.080
Cool!

14:09.140 --> 14:11.040

14:14.500 --> 14:18.540

14:18.600 --> 14:21.530
Hey, Otto, can I use
that microphone?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.280
♪ do-do-do
da-do-do-do... ♪

14:23.340 --> 14:26.680
Sorry, Bart dude,
it's for emergencies only.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.420
But I want to tell them

Oh. Okay.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.520

14:33.590 --> 14:35.820

14:35.890 --> 14:37.090
<i>on my skateboard.</i>

14:37.160 --> 14:38.560
There is a good possibility

14:38.620 --> 14:40.320
I will plunge to my
bloody death.

14:40.390 --> 14:43.060
Hope to see you there.
Thank you.

14:43.130 --> 14:46.600
Springfield Gorge?!
Bart, you'll be killed.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.360
Lisa, I don't know how to
explain this, but I get

14:49.430 --> 14:51.260
the same thrill out of
jumping over stuff

14:51.340 --> 14:54.270
that you do from... reading.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.110
Please, before you do anything

14:56.170 --> 14:58.570
there's someone
I'd like you to talk to.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.010
Thank you for arranging this,
Dr. Hibbert.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.680
Oh, anything I can do

15:02.750 --> 15:05.590
to stem the tide
of entertainment-related injury.

15:05.650 --> 15:07.320
<i>Now children,
you're about to meet</i>

15:07.390 --> 15:09.890
<i>the world's greatest daredevil,
Lance Murdock.</i>

15:09.950 --> 15:12.850
Lance, this is Lisa
and Bart Simpson.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.150
Bart is one
of your biggest fans.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.500
It's an honor, Lance.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.630
How you feeling?

15:17.700 --> 15:20.330
Uh... I... <i>ow.</i>

15:20.400 --> 15:22.370
Doc, I heard a snap.

15:22.430 --> 15:24.800
Mmm. I'm afraid
the bone's broken.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.610
Well, that's all of them.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.210
Don't worry, partner.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.670
I've broken that thumb
dozens of times.

15:29.740 --> 15:31.850
Hey! I bet you'd like an
autograph. Nurse?

15:31.910 --> 15:34.080
Who should I make this out to?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.920
Just Bart
will be fine, sir.

15:35.980 --> 15:40.990
"To Bart. Thanks
for visiting me

15:41.050 --> 15:45.380
at Springfield
General Hospital.

15:45.460 --> 15:50.560
Your visit was
a ray of sunshine

15:50.630 --> 15:54.500
"on an otherwise cloudy day.

15:54.570 --> 15:58.870
Your pal,
Captain Lance Murdock."

15:58.940 --> 16:00.470
Wow, man.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.840
- Thanks, Lance.
- You're welcome.

16:02.910 --> 16:04.380
Take this thing
out of my mouth now.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.370
Mr. Murdoch, my brother
is thinking about

16:06.440 --> 16:09.310
jumping Springfield Gorge
on a skateboard.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.720
Could you leave me

16:10.780 --> 16:12.950
with the young'uns,
please?

16:13.020 --> 16:16.290
Let me start by saying
good for you, son.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.680
<i>It's always good
to see young people</i>

16:17.760 --> 16:19.190
<i>taking an interest
in danger.</i>

16:19.260 --> 16:22.400
A lot of people are gonna be
tellin' you you're crazy,

16:22.460 --> 16:25.170
and maybe they're right,
but the fact of the matter is

16:25.230 --> 16:27.000
bones heal,
chicks dig scars

16:27.070 --> 16:29.170
and the United States of America

16:29.230 --> 16:32.300
has the best doctor-to-daredevil
ratio in the world.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.440
But Captain Murdock...

16:33.500 --> 16:34.470
Thanks, Lance.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.010
You're welcome,
little partner.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.470
On your way out, tell the nurse
I'm ready for my sponge bath...

16:38.540 --> 16:40.040
another fringe benefit.

16:40.110 --> 16:41.280
Nurse?

16:41.350 --> 16:42.820
Homer:
<i>Springfield Gorge?!</i>

16:42.880 --> 16:45.220
I thought we settled
this daredevil junk.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.410
Squealer.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.180
I'm sorry Bart, but if
you got hurt or died

16:49.250 --> 16:52.650
despite the extra attention
I'd receive, I'd miss you.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.950
Bart, I forbid you to jump
over that gorge.

16:55.030 --> 16:56.130
You can't.

16:56.190 --> 16:56.990
I can and do.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.600
Go to your room, Bart.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.830
There, I've done it.
I'm glad somebody
finally stepped in

17:01.900 --> 17:04.099
and put an end
to this nonsense
once and for all.

17:04.170 --> 17:06.339
Hey man, you can tell me
not to do it,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.869
but there's no way you can
watch me 24 hours a day.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.609
And...the minute your
back is turned

17:10.680 --> 17:14.210
I'm grabbing my skateboard
and heading for that gorge.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.150
He's got us, Marge.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.170
There's nothing we can do.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.190
He's as good as dead.
( weeps )

17:20.250 --> 17:22.960
You're his father.
You've got to try
and reason with him.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.560
No, that never works.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.849
He's a goner.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.020
Come on, Homer.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.750
A heart-to-heart talk
with your son.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.330
You've got to try.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.370
Okay, okay. I'll try.

17:36.170 --> 17:37.100
Bart? Bart?

17:37.170 --> 17:38.440
Bart! What are you doing?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.360
Nothing.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.380
You were on your way
to jump the gorge,
weren't you?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.340
Maybe.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.710
Look, I know I can't stop you.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.610
The only thing I can do

17:47.680 --> 17:50.880
is ask you to promise me
you won't jump the gorge.

17:50.950 --> 17:51.650
Okay. I promise.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.520
D-ohhh!

17:52.580 --> 17:53.310
What's the matter?

17:53.380 --> 17:55.450
You didn't mean that.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.790
Bart, this isn't
one of those phony
baloney promises

17:57.860 --> 17:59.690
I don't expect you
to keep.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.230
If you make this promise,
you have to keep it.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.250
Why?

18:03.330 --> 18:04.430
Because if you don't

18:04.500 --> 18:05.970
I'll never believe
anything you say

18:06.030 --> 18:07.400
ever again.

18:07.470 --> 18:08.770
Oh, come on.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.430
I mean it, boy.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.810
Well, okay, Dad. I promise.

18:12.870 --> 18:15.680
I will not jump
Springfield Gorge.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.580
That's my boy.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.580
How did it go,
Homer?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.310
You know, Marge,
we got a pretty good kid there.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.350
Well, he's got
a pretty good father.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.190
Where is he?

18:31.260 --> 18:33.260
I thought he said noon.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.020
He's just doing this
to build suspense.

18:36.090 --> 18:37.520
What a showman.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.030
Look! There he is.

18:47.770 --> 18:50.540
Hey, boy,
want to toss the old..?

18:50.610 --> 18:51.780
D-ohhh!

18:51.840 --> 18:54.100
Why, that little liar!
I shoulda--

18:54.180 --> 18:56.380
I was going
to play pickle with him.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.340

Bart!

19:27.310 --> 19:28.420
Boo!
Boo!

19:28.480 --> 19:30.320
Hey, what gives?

19:30.380 --> 19:33.720
Boy, I tried ordering you.
I tried punishing you

19:33.790 --> 19:36.390
and God help me,
I even tried reasoning with you

19:36.450 --> 19:37.650
and the only thing left
for me to do

19:37.720 --> 19:39.260
is jump the gorge myself.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.120
What? Why?

19:41.190 --> 19:42.830
Because <i>that way,
you'll see what it's like</i>

19:42.890 --> 19:44.120
to witness
a family member

19:44.200 --> 19:48.040
stupidly risking his life
for no good reason.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.140
But Dad, you'll never make it.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.270
Don't you think
I know that?

19:54.810 --> 19:56.280
Good-bye, son.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.050
Wait, Dad!
Don't do it!

19:58.110 --> 20:00.680
I won't jump anymore,
I promise.

20:00.750 --> 20:04.380
Oh, thank God,
thank God, thank God.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.550
I love you, Dad.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.090
I love you, too, son.

20:07.150 --> 20:09.120
You know, boy,
I don't think

20:09.190 --> 20:11.260
I've ever felt
as close to you

20:11.320 --> 20:12.420
