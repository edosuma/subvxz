resynced by HoneyG

01:28.872 --> 01:31.534
I've been waiting
for over 30 minutes.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.246
If you don't show up before I count to 100,
I'm leaving!

01:45.822 --> 01:49.451
One! Two!

01:50.694 --> 01:54.755
Three! Four!

03:01.798 --> 03:03.823
I almost fell!

03:07.871 --> 03:11.238
I just picked them up.
I found them here.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.037
Take them off.

03:14.478 --> 03:18.244
I saw them first.
They're mine.

03:18.682 --> 03:22.140
Hey, I was waiting here
for 30 minutes.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.845
Hey!

03:27.891 --> 03:29.552
What are you doing?

03:30.093 --> 03:33.460
I was watching you from the other side.
I was playing with you.

03:33.597 --> 03:38.034
- Don't lie!
- You counted to four just now. No?

03:38.168 --> 03:41.228
But still, I found them first!

03:41.371 --> 03:43.635
- I found them first!
- Let go!

03:44.875 --> 03:46.342
Hey!

03:47.077 --> 03:48.544
Hey!

04:52.776 --> 04:55.643
Choi Young-mi, is that you?

04:56.780 --> 04:58.748
You're playing a joke
on me, huh?

06:25.268 --> 06:33.733
THE RED SHOES

07:00.040 --> 07:02.099
Tae-soo, let's eat.

07:03.443 --> 07:05.604
Honey.

07:05.746 --> 07:09.409
Wow. Wonderful, Tae-soo!

07:11.251 --> 07:12.616
Come here, darling.

07:14.454 --> 07:17.014
- Whose baby girl are you, Tae-soo?
- Daddy's.

07:18.658 --> 07:19.920
Dance once more.

07:22.863 --> 07:24.125
Tae-soo!

07:40.046 --> 07:41.411
It's still raw.

08:13.446 --> 08:15.505
I wanna wear my red shoes!

08:15.649 --> 08:18.812
- Just once for today.
- No!

08:19.352 --> 08:21.718
Tae-soo, please stop this.
Mommy's late.

08:21.855 --> 08:24.824
I wanna wear my red shoes!

08:43.243 --> 08:46.804
Take Tae-soo to her private lessons.

08:48.248 --> 08:49.510
At two today.

08:53.653 --> 08:56.622
Can't you do it
just for once today?

08:57.357 --> 09:00.622
Tae-soo's shoes are here.
Bring them to her.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.892
Aren't you too old to like red?

09:11.137 --> 09:12.399
It doesn't suit you.

09:17.444 --> 09:19.105
Train Tae-soo.

09:20.247 --> 09:22.215
She's old enough
to go to her lessons alone.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.812
Keep an eye on her from behind.

09:59.452 --> 10:00.714
Tae-soo!

10:02.255 --> 10:03.517
Tae-soo!

10:05.158 --> 10:06.716
Tae-soo!

10:08.561 --> 10:09.823
Tae-soo!

10:11.064 --> 10:13.328
Tae-soo didn't come today.

10:18.438 --> 10:20.099
Tae-soo!

10:20.840 --> 10:22.501
Tae-soo!

10:22.842 --> 10:24.309
Tae-soo!

10:24.945 --> 10:26.503
Tae-soo!

10:41.761 --> 10:43.023
Tae-soo!

11:09.185 --> 11:10.550
Like it?

11:10.687 --> 11:13.053
These shoes look better on you.

11:27.470 --> 11:31.930
Mom, I'm hungry.
Let's go home.

11:32.075 --> 11:33.542
Okay.

11:40.283 --> 11:44.652
Tae-soo, wanna sleep
next to mommy tonight?

11:45.288 --> 11:49.349
- Why?
- Just because.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.558
Mommy wants to sleep with Tae-soo.

11:53.696 --> 11:56.426
Mommy will read you
a fairy tale, okay?

11:56.766 --> 11:59.929
So that Tae-soo
won't have any scary dreams.

12:00.770 --> 12:04.729
But it's more fun
when daddy reads it to me.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.140
Please come inside.

13:18.481 --> 13:20.449
This is the living room.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.148
I'll replace that for you.

13:24.287 --> 13:27.745
And over here is the kitchen.

13:28.891 --> 13:33.555
- Where's the bathroom?
- Ah, yes. The toilet's this way.

13:47.477 --> 13:50.742
- Have anywhere else available?
- Pardon?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.742
Well,

13:53.883 --> 13:58.252
you can't find a place this big
with the money you're offering.

13:58.688 --> 14:01.452
Plus, the subway's close to here.

14:20.977 --> 14:22.444
You old hag!

14:22.578 --> 14:26.537
I told you not to come in here!

14:26.682 --> 14:29.242
I should run you out
of the basement, too.

14:29.886 --> 14:32.650
She lives in the basement.
She's not a bad person though.

14:33.389 --> 14:37.155
She's a bit deranged.
Hurry and come out.

15:26.275 --> 15:28.038
So pretty...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.645
Do you like it, Tae-soo?

15:31.681 --> 15:35.242
Han Tae-soo!
I don't mind you practicing,

15:35.384 --> 15:38.649
but don't run up and down like that.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.057
- Still not done?
- The switch!

16:02.979 --> 16:05.345
Lots of things
are clogged up in there.

16:05.481 --> 16:07.142
Stuff that you want.

16:07.583 --> 16:11.747
Like Tae-soo, money,
glamorous shoes.

16:12.288 --> 16:14.153
But still, there's no husband.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.361
Your wound's okay now,

16:19.996 --> 16:22.931
but your eyes
have gone bad with age.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.626
What are you talking about?
No way.

16:28.271 --> 16:31.934
- I must be temporarily near-sighted.
- Probably so.

16:32.775 --> 16:35.437
It's all because of that bastard.

16:35.578 --> 16:39.139
Women who have good jobs
should stay single like me.

16:39.582 --> 16:44.849
Kim Mi-hee.
He's Tae-soo's father, not "bastard".

16:47.490 --> 16:51.358
And never mention that bastard
in front of me again.

16:52.995 --> 16:54.656
So when will your
new clinic open?

16:56.065 --> 16:58.625
Construction started today,

16:59.569 --> 17:02.333
so about three weeks
until the interior's done.

17:09.579 --> 17:11.342
So I was wondering...

17:12.582 --> 17:14.049
Do you need money?

17:15.685 --> 17:17.744
I see you didn't
get enough alimony.

17:18.588 --> 17:22.354
It's that self-pride of yours
that will do you wrong, you know.

17:22.491 --> 17:25.949
If a divorced woman raises her kid
alone and even has no money,

17:26.295 --> 17:28.160
it's pitiful, I tell you.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.634
Marketing for your eye clinic?

18:17.680 --> 18:18.942
That was corny.

18:19.582 --> 18:23.245
My name's Cho In-chul.
I'm the interior designer.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.053
I just moved in.

18:27.490 --> 18:30.550
It's okay if I stay here
till the construction's done, right?

18:36.866 --> 18:39.027
Are you doing it all yourself?

18:49.578 --> 18:51.739
How long will it take?

18:53.282 --> 18:57.150
When I get the vibe, about two weeks?
But I can't guarantee it.

18:58.287 --> 18:59.549
What's "vibe"?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.652
A "feel".

19:04.894 --> 19:08.057
I'm in a bit of a hurry,

19:09.665 --> 19:11.633
so can't it be any faster?

19:11.767 --> 19:14.429
Slipping a brush into someone's hand,
and asking for art immediately

19:18.174 --> 19:19.436
would be irresponsible.

19:20.476 --> 19:23.639
Don't worry so much.
I'll start as soon as I get the feel.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.349
Also, I noticed
that the budget is low.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.679
It's not that I'm complaining.

19:30.853 --> 19:33.913
It's just that I'll have
to brainstorm more.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.251
Are you always this slimy?

19:41.097 --> 19:46.535
No. There's no
particular problem.

19:46.669 --> 19:49.229
Can you just send
me someone else?

19:53.375 --> 19:55.536
Then please do it soon, thanks.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.553
Far-sighted due to age?

23:13.275 --> 23:17.143
Mommy.
You bought new shoes again?

23:18.447 --> 23:19.539
No.

23:19.982 --> 23:23.941
- I wanna try them on, too.
- You can't!

23:24.086 --> 23:27.351
Mommy, I hate you!
Your feet are ugly!

23:27.489 --> 23:29.855
How can you wear these?

23:29.992 --> 23:32.358
You could hurt your ankles
and not dance again.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.654
Let's hurry to bed.

23:46.375 --> 23:50.539
Lift up your chins and turn.
And to the left.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.546
One, two, three, plie.

23:53.682 --> 23:58.745
Pas plie, one.
Turn, and one, two,

23:58.887 --> 24:01.355
three, four, go back.

24:01.490 --> 24:07.053
Plie. The opposite way.
And turn and turn.

24:07.196 --> 24:10.427
Look ahead. Towards me.
One, jump, three, four.

24:10.566 --> 24:12.329
Go back and run.

24:12.968 --> 24:15.630
Tae-soo, give it to Gyu-won.

24:15.771 --> 24:18.638
Gyu-won! Next person
come to the front.

24:18.774 --> 24:21.140
Quickly.

24:27.182 --> 24:28.444
What do you think?

24:29.585 --> 24:30.847
Do you like it?

24:33.188 --> 24:35.247
So then, do I keep the job?

24:36.291 --> 24:38.657
I heard that you
couldn't work with me.

24:43.866 --> 24:45.333
Has your "vibe" come?

24:51.273 --> 24:55.039
Anyway, do you eat
with your left hand or right?

24:58.280 --> 25:01.738
I need to know which hand you'll use
in order to arrange things.

25:03.786 --> 25:06.949
- I'm left-handed.
- You must've found things uncomfortable.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.057
I'll keep in mind for the design
that you're a lefty.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.031
Anyway, will you manage
by eating just that?

25:20.169 --> 25:23.935
What's wrong with ramen noodles?
I have a rice roll, too.

25:27.676 --> 25:31.442
I'm sorry if I'm being rude,

25:33.182 --> 25:35.343
but you're not homeless, right?

25:37.386 --> 25:41.345
I have a house
and I lived with a woman.

25:41.890 --> 25:43.357
But we're broken up now.

25:45.494 --> 25:47.962
Now I don't have anyone
waiting at home for me.

25:48.097 --> 25:50.930
I have no complaints
about living like this.

25:57.873 --> 26:00.137
Will your husband be upset
if I asked you to cook for me?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.447
I'm not implying anything.

26:05.581 --> 26:09.745
Just that I miss homemade cooking.

26:12.387 --> 26:15.652
I have to go.
I have to meet my daughter.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.053
Wait!

26:20.395 --> 26:22.727
What are you doing?
Please stop it.

26:23.565 --> 26:26.625
It's image association.
That's the examination room.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.932
Hold still.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.030
This is the waiting room.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.537
- We're done for today.
- Good work everyone.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.942
- Don't drink too much tonight.
- Okay!

29:22.377 --> 29:25.141
And for over here,
purple would be nice.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.249
A light purple is easy on the eyes
for an eye clinic.

29:29.584 --> 29:32.052
Also, I did some work
on the logo design.

29:35.390 --> 29:39.053
What? Is there something
on my face?

29:42.964 --> 29:45.125
Now I see your face more clearly.

29:46.468 --> 29:48.436
My eyes have gotten better.

29:55.277 --> 29:58.838
Would you like
to come over for dinner?

30:02.784 --> 30:04.342
I'm inviting you.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.947
Did you get
your husband's permission?

30:11.293 --> 30:12.954
I live alone with my daughter.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.320
I'm divorced.

30:33.382 --> 30:34.747
Think you're being tested?

30:35.884 --> 30:38.648
There's no need to worry.
It's delicious.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.644
Tae-soo!
What's wrong with you?

31:13.088 --> 31:15.648
Dad was here during the day.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.025
- Tae-soo, go to your room.
- Mommy.

31:23.165 --> 31:25.725
Now! Didn't you hear me?

31:25.867 --> 31:29.633
No, every time I bring up dad,
you get mad.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.134
- That's because it's a lie.
- It's not a lie!

31:33.275 --> 31:36.142
- Dad really came!
- Tae-soo!

31:38.580 --> 31:40.741
You know daddy went far away.

31:41.082 --> 31:42.743
So how could he come here?

31:42.884 --> 31:44.852
He doesn't even know
that we live here.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.954
You know I hate it when you lie.

31:47.088 --> 31:49.750
I hate it, too!
You being with this guy!

31:49.891 --> 31:52.758
Daddy will hate it, too!
I hate this guy, too!

32:01.470 --> 32:03.665
Tae-soo must've been
very close to her father.

32:03.939 --> 32:05.873
She seems to miss him a lot.

32:06.975 --> 32:08.237
I'm sorry.

32:15.784 --> 32:17.445
Lost the other pair?

32:36.671 --> 32:41.438
- These would look good on you.
- You really think it would?

32:58.894 --> 33:02.330
Sung-joon! Sung-joon!

33:02.764 --> 33:04.322
Sung-joon!

33:04.566 --> 33:06.124
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

33:07.569 --> 33:10.129
Where's Sung-joon?
Where the hell is he?

33:10.272 --> 33:13.537
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go! Move!

33:14.075 --> 33:17.044
Hand Sung-joon over.
Hand him over now!

33:17.979 --> 33:20.948
Where did you hide him?
Hurry and hand him over!

33:21.082 --> 33:24.051
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!

33:27.188 --> 33:30.954
How funny.
I guess you do have a heart.

33:31.793 --> 33:34.557
Know how lonely Sung-joon was
because of you?

33:35.096 --> 33:37.826
Hand Sung-joon over.
Hand him over!

33:37.966 --> 33:39.228
That's enough!

33:40.669 --> 33:41.829
Get out!

33:42.971 --> 33:45.633
There's no use in hiding him!
I stole him from you.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.140
- Get out!
- Let go!

33:49.277 --> 33:52.440
He's mine now!

34:12.867 --> 34:14.129
Are you okay?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.637
Can you please go?

35:02.784 --> 35:06.550
I hate it, too.
You being with this guy.

35:07.188 --> 35:11.454
Daddy will hate it, too.
I hate this guy, too.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.035
Tae-soo.

36:34.876 --> 36:37.037
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

36:38.480 --> 36:39.845
Tae-soo.

36:42.484 --> 36:43.849
Tae-soo.

36:48.690 --> 36:50.055
Tae-soo, no!

36:50.592 --> 36:52.958
Don't, Tae-soo.
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.

36:53.094 --> 36:55.324
Tae-soo, what's wrong?

38:00.995 --> 38:04.021
Tae-soo, what's wrong with you?

38:07.268 --> 38:10.635
Okay, I'm sorry about yelling
at you yesterday. Satisfied now?

38:11.172 --> 38:13.140
So hand them over right now!
I'm late!

38:15.276 --> 38:19.042
- They're mommy's!
- Those red shoes aren't yours!

38:20.481 --> 38:23.143
If you keep this up,
I'll get very angry!

38:33.094 --> 38:34.254
Not going to your lessons?

39:44.265 --> 39:48.133
Would you treat me to dinner
if I asked you to?

39:53.574 --> 39:57.738
You said these would look
good on me, remember?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.245
Has your vibe come?

40:06.988 --> 40:11.357
The food's good, but the restaurant's
ambience was a bit stuffy.

40:15.363 --> 40:18.025
I overdid it, of course.
Since I was too ambitious.

40:19.467 --> 40:22.925
I wanted to give it my all.
Like my first love experience.

40:24.272 --> 40:26.934
That was the first place
I worked on.

40:30.478 --> 40:33.242
Then where's your favorite?

40:35.083 --> 40:38.951
The place you worked on
that you like the most?

40:40.088 --> 40:43.353
- You'll be disappointed though.
- But I'm curious.

40:44.892 --> 40:46.359
Then do you want to see it?

40:55.770 --> 41:00.139
Have a seat wherever you like.
Don't need to take off your shoes.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.538
Is it still under construction?

41:05.680 --> 41:07.944
No, this is it.

41:13.688 --> 41:14.848
Who's this?

41:17.692 --> 41:21.753
It's not me, is it?

41:22.964 --> 41:27.333
It's the girl I lived with.
My ex-girlfriend.

41:36.477 --> 41:38.445
Those shoes look good on you.

41:38.613 --> 41:40.706
They don't look good
on just anyone, you know.

41:42.283 --> 41:44.751
But, why are they so familiar?

41:45.787 --> 41:48.347
I swear I've seen them
somewhere before.

41:51.793 --> 41:53.158
Want to sleep over?

41:58.666 --> 42:00.429
Oh right, your daughter.

42:03.671 --> 42:07.232
Are you mad that I'm too forward?

44:55.176 --> 44:58.441
- What in the world did I do wrong?
- I told you not to wear them!

44:58.579 --> 45:01.639
- But they're mommy's.
- No, they're mine now!

45:01.782 --> 45:03.147
Don't touch them!

45:08.990 --> 45:10.958
Tae-soo. Tae-soo!

45:11.792 --> 45:15.421
- Give them to me! They're mommy's.
- They're mine now!

45:15.563 --> 45:17.827
- They're mommy's.
- They're mine now!

45:17.965 --> 45:19.728
- Be a good girl.
- No!

45:19.867 --> 45:22.335
- Give them here! Listen to me!
- No!

45:22.470 --> 45:24.028
- No!
- Give them to me!

45:24.171 --> 45:26.435
- No!
- I told you they're mommy's.

45:26.574 --> 45:30.840
- No! They're mine!
- What's wrong with you?

45:31.579 --> 45:33.447
- They're mine!
- Fight quietly, will you?

45:33.482 --> 45:35.278
The neighbors will call the police.

45:36.784 --> 45:38.046
Tae-soo, present!

45:44.592 --> 45:46.457
Try to act your age with the kid.

45:52.066 --> 45:55.934
You're amazing.
I see you're keeping up your hobby.

45:57.772 --> 45:59.239
Did you put on make-up?

46:02.376 --> 46:06.039
- What brings you here at this hour?
- Aren't I always invited?

46:06.480 --> 46:11.144
Can't make time during the day.
Always busy as hell.

46:14.088 --> 46:15.851
This place is tiny.

46:15.990 --> 46:18.720
How could you have stooped
down this far?

46:18.893 --> 46:20.622
Isn't it uncomfortable?

46:24.365 --> 46:26.424
I have no problem managing.

46:27.468 --> 46:29.629
And it doesn't need to be big
for two people.

46:30.071 --> 46:32.573
Have some self-esteem
only when you need it.

46:32.608 --> 46:34.438
Don't be like that even to me.

46:36.577 --> 46:39.546
Anyway, that bastard...

46:42.983 --> 46:44.848
Has Tae-soo's father been here?

46:46.487 --> 46:49.354
- No.
- Does he know that you live here?

46:53.694 --> 46:55.161
Anyway, what was that?

46:56.464 --> 46:59.024
- What?
- What Tae-soo was hugging.

46:59.667 --> 47:03.728
Weren't you two fighting over that?
The color was very unique.

47:04.372 --> 47:05.839
What brand is that one?

47:07.975 --> 47:10.842
- Subway.
- Subway?

47:12.380 --> 47:13.642
Subway shopping center?

47:14.982 --> 47:18.941
I picked them up, actually.
They seemed to have no owner.

47:21.188 --> 47:25.557
- They seemed to have no owner.
- Oh, sorry. I'll wash up first.

47:25.693 --> 47:28.628
- Okay.
- Or help yourself to some tea first.

47:41.075 --> 47:43.635
Can't I wear them just once?

47:45.279 --> 47:47.042
Just once.

47:48.382 --> 47:50.543
Want money?
How much will it take?

47:53.087 --> 47:56.750
Why aren't you listening to me?
I'm gonna wear it just once.

47:57.691 --> 47:59.352
Just once!

48:06.767 --> 48:10.533
What do you mean I stole it?
I'm just borrowing it for a sec.

48:11.772 --> 48:15.435
Hurt?
She got hurt just because of that?

48:16.277 --> 48:18.245
She'll get over it soon.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.448
Okay, I'll return it.

48:22.383 --> 48:26.342
Come over tomorrow night.
I'll be waiting with my hands up.

48:28.289 --> 48:32.851
By the way,
know how great I feel right now?

48:33.594 --> 48:36.927
I feel so much younger
with these shoes on.

48:38.065 --> 48:40.226
My feet feel like dancing
on their own.

50:52.266 --> 50:56.225
The number you have dialed
is not available.

50:56.370 --> 50:58.930
Please leave a message
after the beep.

51:01.575 --> 51:06.945
Kim Mi-hee! You could ruin our
mother-daughter relationship.

51:07.081 --> 51:09.345
You better call me fast
before I report you.

51:17.191 --> 51:18.852
You look much different
from yesterday.

51:21.595 --> 51:24.826
- I do?
- Why didn't you wear them today?

51:36.377 --> 51:37.537
What is it?

51:46.186 --> 51:48.654
It's them, right?
The shoes you wore.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.556
They're different from my shoes.

51:56.263 --> 51:57.924
Did I make a mistake then?

51:59.066 --> 52:01.330
These shoes aren't the only
ones in this world.

52:04.071 --> 52:05.333
Right.

52:11.078 --> 52:12.340
Hello?

52:13.781 --> 52:15.043
What?

52:40.174 --> 52:43.234
You're the murderer, aren't you?

52:47.581 --> 52:51.642
Detective Lee,
quiet them down, will you?

52:51.785 --> 52:55.653
Detective Bak,
I told you to shut them up!

52:59.893 --> 53:05.024
Some high school girl was looking
for her dead friend's shoes.

53:05.165 --> 53:06.723
She said it was hers.

53:07.768 --> 53:10.032
But there weren't any shoes
at the murder site.

53:13.373 --> 53:18.140
So her legs were cut off, too?

53:19.379 --> 53:21.142
Well, in the end they were.

53:21.982 --> 53:28.251
So my friend wasn't wearing
anything on her feet?

53:28.388 --> 53:31.255
I told you she
had no shoes on!

53:32.893 --> 53:37.523
Anyway, why is everyone
looking for those damn shoes?

53:39.266 --> 53:42.633
Lady, you seem to
know something.

53:42.770 --> 53:44.431
What are you talking about?

53:58.685 --> 54:00.050
What the hell?

54:09.663 --> 54:12.029
Mister. Mister.

54:12.366 --> 54:15.529
Call an ambulance right away!

54:15.969 --> 54:17.527
Hold on!

54:21.875 --> 54:25.038
You need to be authorized
to see those pictures.

54:26.580 --> 54:28.445
The husband needs to sign here.

54:29.983 --> 54:31.450
Husband: Han Sung-joon

54:31.885 --> 54:33.352
Husband?

54:35.689 --> 54:37.554
She wasn't divorced?

56:21.395 --> 56:24.626
Who brought you those shoes,
Tae-soo?

56:24.765 --> 56:26.824
Give them to me. Hurry.

56:28.168 --> 56:31.137
They aren't yours,
and mine neither.

56:31.271 --> 56:33.831
Then whose are they?
I need them.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.942
I can't dance without them.

56:36.076 --> 56:37.634
Tae-soo, you can't wear these.

56:37.778 --> 56:40.338
- Give them to me.
- No! No!

56:40.480 --> 56:41.640
- Tae-soo!
- No!

56:41.782 --> 56:43.044
Now!

56:44.384 --> 56:45.646
Mommy.

59:37.891 --> 59:39.051
Tae-soo.

59:51.972 --> 59:54.440
No, Tae-soo. Take them off.

59:54.574 --> 59:56.041
Hurry and take them off.

59:56.576 --> 59:58.134
No, Tae-soo!

1:00:05.085 --> 1:00:06.245
Tae-soo.

1:00:10.390 --> 1:00:11.550
Tae-soo!

1:00:34.481 --> 1:00:37.541
- How is she?
- I examined her thoroughly,

1:00:37.684 --> 1:00:39.345
but her body is fine.

1:00:39.486 --> 1:00:43.445
Her brain waves and pulse rate
are normal, but she won't wake up.

1:00:51.565 --> 1:00:53.430
Sun-jae, are you okay?

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:59.129
Tae-soo! Open your eyes!
It's mommy!

1:00:59.272 --> 1:01:01.331
- Tae-soo, what happened to you?
- Please calm down, Sun-jae.

1:01:01.474 --> 1:01:05.035
- Tae-soo, it's mommy!
- Sun-jae! Sun-jae!

1:01:05.178 --> 1:01:08.841
Let go of me! Let go!

1:01:08.982 --> 1:01:11.041
- Tae-soo, my sweetie, what happened?
- Please calm down.

1:01:11.184 --> 1:01:15.143
Your child is fine. We just need to wait.
She'll turn out fine, so calm down.

1:01:15.288 --> 1:01:21.557
It's mommy. Open your eyes.

1:01:21.695 --> 1:01:25.927
Tae-soo, please open your eyes.

1:01:32.272 --> 1:01:36.538
Tae-soo, it's okay now.

1:01:36.676 --> 1:01:41.045
Everything will be okay.

1:01:50.190 --> 1:01:51.248
I'm sure of it.

1:01:53.193 --> 1:01:58.130
These...
I swear that Mi-hee took them.

1:02:02.369 --> 1:02:04.030
Your friend is dead.

1:02:05.605 --> 1:02:06.970
And these shoes...

1:02:07.107 --> 1:02:09.473
You kept clenching on to them
ever since you came to the hospital.

1:02:09.676 --> 1:02:13.237
This is insane. It's not me.

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:19.043
Who the hell brought them?
Who? Who?

1:02:21.388 --> 1:02:22.548
Why?

1:02:26.793 --> 1:02:29.023
Why do they keep coming
to Tae-soo?

1:02:29.296 --> 1:02:31.526
I'm the one who
first picked them up.

1:02:31.965 --> 1:02:33.626
I wore them, too.

1:02:36.069 --> 1:02:38.037
Why hasn't anything
happened to me?

1:02:46.179 --> 1:02:47.441
You...

1:02:49.683 --> 1:02:51.844
- I can't trust you.
- What?

1:02:51.985 --> 1:02:55.250
How'd you come to the hospital?
Who called you?

1:02:56.289 --> 1:02:59.554
What are you talking about?
You called me, remember?

1:03:00.994 --> 1:03:04.225
Well, to be exact,
you called and then hung up.

1:03:04.364 --> 1:03:05.729
Where'd you get this picture?

1:03:05.865 --> 1:03:08.629
The girl in this picture
Who the hell is she?

1:03:09.469 --> 1:03:11.835
I tore it from a magazine.
Is that so wrong?

1:03:11.971 --> 1:03:15.338
I'm asking you who she is!
Who is she? Who?

1:03:15.475 --> 1:03:18.842
Who is she, damn it?
Tell me!

1:03:18.978 --> 1:03:21.742
You really don't
know who she is?

1:03:33.593 --> 1:03:35.424
It's an ad made by
some company.

1:03:36.162 --> 1:03:38.426
Her picture is all over the city.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.565
I'm telling you
that I don't know who she is!

1:04:13.733 --> 1:04:15.428
How many times
do I need to repeat it?

1:04:15.568 --> 1:04:18.036
I can't get any work done
because of these calls!

1:04:18.171 --> 1:04:19.229
This is driving me nuts!

1:04:19.372 --> 1:04:21.340
How can an ad agency
not know their model?

1:04:21.474 --> 1:04:22.736
What?

1:04:23.476 --> 1:04:24.738
Please go.

1:04:26.379 --> 1:04:29.746
I'm sorry.
It's really important to us.

1:04:29.883 --> 1:04:33.341
If it's an ad campaign that big,
someone should know who she is.

1:04:33.486 --> 1:04:34.748
I beg you.

1:04:39.592 --> 1:04:42.720
Know how many calls I got today
because of this one girl?

1:04:48.868 --> 1:04:51.132
This picture is over 60 years old.

1:04:51.471 --> 1:04:57.034
That is, to be exact...
The picture came out in 1944.

1:04:57.777 --> 1:05:00.837
One of our staff found it
by chance on the Internet.

1:05:02.882 --> 1:05:08.548
- So what did you want to know?
- This picture... Who took it?

1:05:09.189 --> 1:05:12.750
You can find out on the Internet.
Hold on.

1:05:23.069 --> 1:05:25.333
As you can see,
this is all that we know.

1:05:25.472 --> 1:05:29.636
It's being passed around
on the Internet.

1:05:29.776 --> 1:05:33.337
A dance composer named Jung Ha-sub took
his dancer's picture. He died at 31.

1:05:53.066 --> 1:05:55.432
I told the police everything.

1:05:55.768 --> 1:05:58.134
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

1:05:59.772 --> 1:06:01.137
Wait!

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:09.045
Are these them?

1:06:32.472 --> 1:06:39.742
Bloody Wedding
Mystery Surrounding Keiko's Death

1:06:48.288 --> 1:06:53.055
I picked up those shoes.
And my friend took them from me.

1:07:12.378 --> 1:07:15.643
I won't die. My daughter will.

1:07:16.282 --> 1:07:19.445
What are you talking about?
Talk clearly.

1:07:19.886 --> 1:07:22.855
The friend of that girl
who had her feet cut off...

1:07:22.989 --> 1:07:24.957
She was wearing
those shoes like me,

1:07:25.091 --> 1:07:26.752
but nothing happened to her.

1:07:28.861 --> 1:07:32.228
All she did was
wear the red shoes.

1:07:32.365 --> 1:07:37.132
And her friend
took those shoes away from her.

1:07:39.272 --> 1:07:41.536
What about your daughter,
Tae-soo?

1:07:44.077 --> 1:07:45.840
She took them away from me.

1:07:46.879 --> 1:07:49.746
And my dead friend, Mi-hee,
took them from my daughter.

1:07:53.786 --> 1:07:55.344
I'm so angry.

1:07:56.589 --> 1:07:58.648
If I hadn't picked up those shoes...

1:08:03.162 --> 1:08:10.534
Mi-hee's death and Tae-soo...
It's all my fault!

1:08:11.771 --> 1:08:15.639
Stay calm.
Where are you? I'll go to you.

1:08:45.672 --> 1:08:47.139
Here's something interesting.

1:08:49.375 --> 1:08:53.641
Jung Ha-sub's dance hall
was at Goksung station back then.

1:08:56.582 --> 1:08:59.346
Your house is at that very spot.

1:09:01.587 --> 1:09:05.648
Jung Ha-sub, Keiko,
and the girl in the ad.

1:09:06.492 --> 1:09:12.021
If one of these girls
were Jung Ha-sub's mistress...

1:09:13.066 --> 1:09:17.230
How come guys
only think that way?

1:09:19.072 --> 1:09:23.736
Look, no emotion is more fatal
than an obsessed love.

1:09:24.777 --> 1:09:29.737
Didn't you want to kill that woman
who slept with your husband?

1:09:30.083 --> 1:09:31.345
What did you say?

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:33.847
I mean,

1:09:33.986 --> 1:09:38.252
that kind of emotion
is strong enough to kill someone.

1:09:39.492 --> 1:09:42.120
- Don't force any reason.
- Be honest.

1:09:42.462 --> 1:09:44.430
Just tell me how you felt!

1:09:45.364 --> 1:09:48.629
I know you're upset by your husband,
but you can't avoid it!

1:09:48.768 --> 1:09:51.236
Why are you bringing him up
all of a sudden?

1:09:51.771 --> 1:09:55.138
You should call him
after what happened to Tae-soo.

1:09:55.274 --> 1:09:57.139
- Your husband should know, too!
- Stop it!

1:09:57.276 --> 1:09:59.540
- She's his daughter, too!
- I said stop it!

1:10:02.181 --> 1:10:07.141
You repress yourself in a weird way
and then change frighteningly.

1:10:07.286 --> 1:10:09.948
When your husband is an issue,
you're not yourself at all!

1:10:10.089 --> 1:10:11.454
What do you know?

1:10:11.624 --> 1:10:14.092
Think you know all about me
after you slept with me once?

1:10:14.393 --> 1:10:16.623
Watch what you say to me!

1:10:44.190 --> 1:10:45.851
Shut the hell up!

1:12:02.468 --> 1:12:03.628
Tae-soo.

1:12:05.171 --> 1:12:06.536
Tae-soo?

1:12:49.682 --> 1:12:53.049
Tae-soo. Tae-soo. Tae-soo...

1:12:55.288 --> 1:12:56.448
Tae-soo...

1:14:12.064 --> 1:14:13.429
Hunchback...

1:14:18.371 --> 1:14:20.236
- The old woman.
- What's wrong?

1:14:21.474 --> 1:14:23.135
Hurry, I need to check something.

1:14:44.263 --> 1:14:46.925
You.
You know what these are, right?

1:14:48.067 --> 1:14:54.233
I don't know.
I don't know a thing. Right?

1:14:55.374 --> 1:14:58.138
Look, someone's life is at stake.

1:14:58.277 --> 1:14:59.938
Tell us what you know.

1:15:04.483 --> 1:15:08.146
You shouldn't have worn
something that pretty without asking.

1:15:10.489 --> 1:15:14.550
Look here.
Tell us. Please tell us.

1:15:17.263 --> 1:15:21.427
Hurry and return them.

1:15:22.268 --> 1:15:27.729
Or else, you'll die like her.

1:15:28.574 --> 1:15:32.840
To whom?
How do I return them?

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:37.544
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

1:15:37.683 --> 1:15:40.550
- Hurry and tell me!
- I don't know!

1:15:40.886 --> 1:15:42.148
Wait!

1:15:53.065 --> 1:15:57.627
You know something for sure, right?
Tell me! Tell me now!

1:15:57.770 --> 1:15:59.931
Hurry and tell me!

1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:11.746
Stop it! Please stop!

1:16:19.492 --> 1:16:26.625
Gyung-soon.
The shoes were definitely Oki's.

1:16:26.765 --> 1:16:30.223
- Who's Gyung-soon?
- Keiko.

1:16:30.369 --> 1:16:34.328
The MP Chief.
The Pro-Japanese Party's daughter.

1:16:35.674 --> 1:16:39.940
Who is this Oki?
And why did Keiko die like that?

1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:46.650
Tell me. Tell me everything.
Tell me exactly what you know!

1:16:46.785 --> 1:16:50.744
Tell me now!
Tell me now! Tell me!

1:16:50.890 --> 1:16:52.448
Tell me!

1:17:06.472 --> 1:17:09.339
- Sun-jae.
- Tae-soo?

1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:16.047
Sun-jae.

1:17:19.785 --> 1:17:23.050
- Sun-jae.
- Tae-soo.

1:17:26.392 --> 1:17:29.418
- Tae-soo?
- Sun-jae.

1:17:35.267 --> 1:17:37.531
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.

1:17:39.672 --> 1:17:40.934
Tae-soo.

1:23:59.484 --> 1:24:03.750
Did a woman just leave here?

1:24:13.966 --> 1:24:15.228
Why did you do it?

1:24:22.174 --> 1:24:23.835
To forget about you.

1:24:26.478 --> 1:24:28.139
What did you say?

1:24:28.981 --> 1:24:31.108
Did you hit me
because you love me?

1:24:31.283 --> 1:24:33.877
Or because you hate
that I was stolen from you?

1:24:38.190 --> 1:24:39.555
I'm scared of you.

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.627
What are you talking about?

1:24:54.673 --> 1:24:56.140
Tae-soo gave it to me.

1:24:56.875 --> 1:25:01.335
She said that her father came.
But you wouldn't believe her,

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:03.038
- so if I delivered...
- That's a lie!

1:25:03.882 --> 1:25:05.747
I told you that he's not here.

1:25:08.887 --> 1:25:10.047
Then where is he?

1:25:10.489 --> 1:25:13.356
You should know!
Since you're not divorced yet.

1:25:14.359 --> 1:25:16.327
No airport record of your husband
leaving this country.

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:18.056
And you're
not divorced on paper.

1:25:18.964 --> 1:25:21.831
What the hell are
you holding back?

1:25:28.674 --> 1:25:30.733
You're being out of line.

1:25:33.378 --> 1:25:35.539
Know what Tae-soo said?

1:25:37.983 --> 1:25:41.749
She said that daddy's cold.
And he must be taken out.

1:25:41.887 --> 1:25:47.052
I don't know what you're saying.
But let's stop seeing each other.

1:25:49.561 --> 1:25:51.222
I see you're a bit surprised.

1:25:52.564 --> 1:25:56.330
Pretending to be refined,
clean, and unselfish.

1:25:57.169 --> 1:26:01.435
But the real you
is a total hypocrite, a horny bitch.

1:26:04.876 --> 1:26:06.844
Why are you doing this?

1:26:09.381 --> 1:26:10.848
I have the right to know.

1:26:13.385 --> 1:26:15.945
Others may not have to,
but I must!

1:26:17.589 --> 1:26:18.851
Why?

1:26:21.693 --> 1:26:23.126
Don't you know why?

1:26:28.867 --> 1:26:32.735
I want to know everything about you.

1:26:35.173 --> 1:26:37.539
I don't care what you did.

1:26:39.277 --> 1:26:43.543
So tell me.
Tell me with your very own lips!

1:26:46.985 --> 1:26:48.247
You're right.

1:26:55.660 --> 1:27:03.123
My daughter.
Lied to you.

1:27:06.271 --> 1:27:10.935
My husband can't come.

1:27:14.679 --> 1:27:16.647
You've guessed it yourself.

1:27:18.583 --> 1:27:20.642
About what could've
happened to him.

1:27:25.490 --> 1:27:27.048
Tell me it's not true.

1:27:29.261 --> 1:27:31.229
I'd rather hear some other excuse.

1:27:53.885 --> 1:27:55.147
Tell me.

1:27:56.888 --> 1:28:00.051
- Tell me where you got this from?
- From daddy.

1:28:05.063 --> 1:28:06.428
Tae-soo.

1:28:11.169 --> 1:28:16.436
Mommy loves Tae-soo very much.

1:28:19.477 --> 1:28:26.542
But mommy really hates
when Tae-soo lies.

1:28:27.586 --> 1:28:31.750
It's not a lie!
Daddy really came!

1:28:31.890 --> 1:28:35.417
He said he's too cold
and to take him out!

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.323
Don't lie to me!

1:28:41.766 --> 1:28:45.634
I told you that daddy couldn't
come here. How can he?

1:28:45.770 --> 1:28:48.739
I told you he can't come here,
so how could he?

1:28:48.874 --> 1:28:50.432
How can he?

1:28:50.976 --> 1:28:54.139
Why did you lie?
Why did you lie?

1:28:56.281 --> 1:29:02.845
Mommy. Mommy.

1:29:04.389 --> 1:29:05.947
Tae-soo.

1:29:09.961 --> 1:29:11.326
Tae-soo.

1:29:12.764 --> 1:29:17.428
Tae-soo, I'm sorry.
Mommy was wrong.

1:29:20.572 --> 1:29:23.632
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.

1:29:25.277 --> 1:29:29.646
Tae-soo, mommy was wrong.
I was wrong.

1:29:29.781 --> 1:29:31.646
Mommy was wrong.

1:29:32.584 --> 1:29:34.142
But mommy

1:29:36.187 --> 1:29:38.655
really hates when Tae-soo lies.

1:29:38.790 --> 1:29:42.817
Mommy, I'm scared! Stop it!
Mommy, what's wrong with you?

1:29:42.961 --> 1:29:46.124
- Tell me. Where did you find it?
- I'm scared!

1:29:46.264 --> 1:29:50.030
- Tell me! Tell me!
- Mommy, I'm scared!

1:29:50.168 --> 1:29:54.036
- Mommy, I'm scared! Help me!
- Where did you get it? Tell me!

1:29:54.172 --> 1:29:56.333
Mommy, Help me!

1:30:00.178 --> 1:30:07.016
Han Tae-soo. Han Tae-soo.
Han Tae-soo. Tae-soo!

1:30:23.068 --> 1:30:26.128
Tae-soo, come to mommy.

1:30:27.973 --> 1:30:29.338
Han Tae-soo.

1:30:31.376 --> 1:30:32.638
Stop!

1:30:35.580 --> 1:30:37.047
Han Tae-soo!

1:30:37.983 --> 1:30:39.348
Han Tae-soo!

1:30:49.461 --> 1:30:54.330
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, come to mommy.

1:30:58.670 --> 1:31:02.834
Mommy's not going to punish you.

1:31:04.275 --> 1:31:10.737
I'm just very curious.
About whether daddy really came to you.

1:31:19.991 --> 1:31:21.151
No.

1:32:24.989 --> 1:32:26.149
Tae-soo?

1:32:29.861 --> 1:32:32.329
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

1:32:55.487 --> 1:32:56.852
Tae-soo?

1:32:57.889 --> 1:32:59.254
Tae-soo!

1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:03.425
Tae-soo!

1:33:06.664 --> 1:33:09.132
Mommy.

1:33:12.871 --> 1:33:17.740
- Tae-soo.
- Mommy.

1:33:33.391 --> 1:33:34.858
Tae-soo!

1:33:40.064 --> 1:33:41.725
Tae-soo!

1:33:46.471 --> 1:33:47.938
Tae-soo!

1:33:54.679 --> 1:33:56.237
Tae-soo!

1:33:57.482 --> 1:33:58.949
Tae-soo!

1:34:03.788 --> 1:34:05.050
Tae-soo!

1:34:06.591 --> 1:34:11.619
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

1:34:20.171 --> 1:34:21.638
No, Tae-soo!

1:34:26.978 --> 1:34:28.741
Stop it!

1:34:30.682 --> 1:34:32.547
Please stop it.

1:34:36.988 --> 1:34:41.448
Why?
Why are you doing this to us?

1:34:45.663 --> 1:34:47.722
I just picked them up.

1:34:48.866 --> 1:34:51.130
That's all I did.

1:35:00.178 --> 1:35:01.543
Tae-soo!

1:35:04.682 --> 1:35:06.343
Tae-soo!

1:35:08.686 --> 1:35:10.847
Tae-soo!

1:35:12.290 --> 1:35:14.349
Take me instead.

1:35:16.661 --> 1:35:20.927
Not my daughter.
Not Tae-soo.

1:35:22.967 --> 1:35:24.525
Please.

1:36:31.469 --> 1:36:37.840
Those who take the red shoes away
will all die.

1:36:37.975 --> 1:36:42.139
Why are you doing this to me?

1:36:44.082 --> 1:36:48.348
Oki.
It's me, Keiko.

1:36:49.387 --> 1:36:52.151
You are Oki.

1:36:52.490 --> 1:36:55.516
- You killed them all.
- No.

1:36:55.660 --> 1:37:00.029
- You killed me, too.
- No. It's impossible.

1:37:00.164 --> 1:37:04.533
It's not me. No, I didn't do it.

1:37:08.573 --> 1:37:11.440
It's not me. It's not me.

1:37:16.981 --> 1:37:20.246
No. No. No!

1:37:24.889 --> 1:37:27.449
Oki. Oki.

1:37:36.868 --> 1:37:39.132
- How'd you know I was at the hospital?
- It's not me.

1:37:39.270 --> 1:37:41.238
No, it's not me.

1:37:41.372 --> 1:37:42.839
You called me.

1:38:01.092 --> 1:38:03.117
Lost the other pair?

1:38:05.563 --> 1:38:07.622
Know what Tae-soo said?

1:38:08.666 --> 1:38:13.228
She said that daddy's cold.
And he must be taken out.
