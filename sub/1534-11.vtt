- Is that like, a real job here?
- Apparently, it is.

I promised all these people I'd
get them their happy endings.

04:27.263 --> 04:29.691
not sure how at this moment.

04:31.022 --> 04:32.721
I think I might have an idea.

04:32.841 --> 04:35.494
Do you know how the Snow Queen
got the idea for the curse?

04:35.614 --> 04:38.068
It's from a legend
called the Trolden Glass.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.120
- Never heard of it.
- Its origin isn't important.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.417
What matters is how they broke the curse.

04:42.437 --> 04:44.104
- What was done?
- Um...

04:44.138 --> 04:45.906
Uh, to break the spell...

04:46.341 --> 04:47.641
Oh.

04:49.402 --> 04:51.599
They had to kill the king.

04:51.823 --> 04:54.212
So in this case, that would mean Ingrid.

04:54.789 --> 04:57.499
I don't believe killing is ever the answer.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.184
Are you sure we can't reason with her?

05:00.224 --> 05:01.266
She's beyond that.

05:01.386 --> 05:02.508
We all want another way,

I'm gonna do what has to be done.

- But...
- We're out of options. Anna,

05:07.382 --> 05:10.228
- how are you with kids?
- I love kids.

05:10.783 --> 05:12.377
- Wait.
- Elsa, we should get going.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.292
Wait. I'm the babysitter?

05:14.316 --> 05:15.606

to stay here with everyone else.

means you need to stay safe.

Emma and I have to solve.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.585
Why was I spared the cloud's curse?

07:01.604 --> 07:04.551
Because your heart wasn't
in your chest, dearie.

07:04.585 --> 07:07.266
It was here in my shop with me.

07:28.301 --> 07:30.065

07:30.360 --> 07:33.091
I shall finally cleave
myself from this dagger

07:42.428 --> 07:44.781
why doesn't he magic
his grandson to his side?

07:44.820 --> 07:46.686

him away for safekeeping.

I tried to.

11:09.253 --> 11:11.906
People in my life, they,
uh, they intervened.

11:12.026 --> 11:13.237
Do you wanna know why?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.891
- Does it matter?
- It did to me.

11:16.244 --> 11:19.242
They stopped me because
they cared about me.

11:19.362 --> 11:21.223
- Lucky you.
- No.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.537
<i>Lucky you.</i>

11:22.657 --> 11:25.006
Because now that you're
living under my roof,

11:25.595 --> 11:27.571
I'm gonna care for you

11:27.939 --> 11:29.412
the way they cared for me.

11:29.532 --> 11:31.186
Yeah, well, don't waste your time.

11:31.306 --> 11:32.925
I'm not interested.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.739
Mm-hmm.

11:36.773 --> 11:39.274
Hmm. Suit yourself.

11:40.292 --> 11:41.278
Go.

11:41.329 --> 11:42.785
I won't stop you.

11:43.131 --> 11:44.331
You won't?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.177
No. Go on.

11:46.201 --> 11:47.660
More cocoa for me.

11:50.481 --> 11:52.725
I understand how difficult it must be

11:52.757 --> 11:55.587
to live under the same
roof as someone like Kevin,

11:55.619 --> 11:57.545
who's deathly afraid of spiders.

11:59.306 --> 12:01.448
Any spiders, really.

12:02.223 --> 12:03.565
Small spiders.

12:03.685 --> 12:07.170
Big spiders. Even the rubber
ones I keep in my desk.

12:07.859 --> 12:10.305
In the drawer on the right.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.158
Behind the box of staples.

12:13.382 --> 12:14.961
Poor Kevin.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.589
It's a shame you can't stay, Emma.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.115
Maybe...

12:24.748 --> 12:27.486
maybe I could hang around for one more day.

12:29.462 --> 12:31.490
Works for me.

You in here?

They're gone.

12:43.302 --> 12:44.736
Then what do we do?

12:46.255 --> 12:47.882
We do it ourselves.

[Shouting continues]

- Doc: Say something!

Dopey, say something!

13:03.866 --> 13:06.892
Open your mouth! Speak, speak, speak!

13:08.949 --> 13:10.833
Move it!

13:15.601 --> 13:16.941
That's ridiculous.

13:16.973 --> 13:18.609
At least I know how to
swaddle our child correctly.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.019
I swaddle him perfectly.

13:20.028 --> 13:22.304
He's a baby, not a breakfast burrito.

13:22.336 --> 13:23.146
Stop it.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.550
I mean, I have to say I expected
more from the two of you.

13:25.558 --> 13:26.592
Use your heads.

13:26.632 --> 13:28.780
Think back to what it was like
before the spell changed you.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.441
Sure, you had issues with each
other, but they were minor.

13:31.457 --> 13:33.076
Minor? Minor?

13:33.196 --> 13:35.352
When I first met her,
she hit me in the face.

13:35.378 --> 13:37.045
If that wasn't a sign,
I don't know what is.

13:37.071 --> 13:39.617
Yes, you responded by hanging
me in a net from a tree.

13:39.617 --> 13:40.720
<i>You're a real prince charming.</i>

13:40.771 --> 13:43.625
<i>Yes, he is Prince Charming,
and you're Snow White.</i>

13:43.683 --> 13:46.132
And those things sound terrible
but they also sound romantic.

13:46.252 --> 13:47.313
Can't you see that?

13:47.381 --> 13:49.000
'Cause if you can see that, then

13:49.051 --> 13:51.250
maybe you can defeat this dark spell.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.714
Someone slip me a poison apple
and put me out of my misery.

13:53.739 --> 13:56.342
Oh! Me! Pick me! Oh, shut it, Ice Man.

13:56.381 --> 13:59.401
Ice Man? Who you calling
Ice Man, stable boy?

13:59.433 --> 14:01.472
I'm calling you Ice Man.
And you're from Arendelle.

14:01.496 --> 14:02.424
<i>What are you doing selling ice?</i>

14:02.435 --> 14:05.344
- The whole place is frozen!
- Ice is a very important commodity.

14:05.507 --> 14:06.965
<i>You know what, Swiss Miss?</i>

14:07.031 --> 14:07.982
You do know me.

14:08.909 --> 14:10.120
I pick flowers.

14:10.494 --> 14:11.951
I talk to birds.

14:12.071 --> 14:14.270
[Whispers] I do all kinds
of warm, fuzzy things.

14:14.537 --> 14:15.774
And you know what else?

14:17.009 --> 14:18.076
I kill.

14:18.144 --> 14:19.344
Yeah, that's right.

14:19.411 --> 14:20.899
[Singsongy] Snow White's a murderer.

14:21.823 --> 14:24.577
I killed the Evil Queen's mommy.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.101
<i>And I said I was sorry...</i>

14:26.221 --> 14:27.840
[Singsongy] And it didn't mean it.

That's horrible.

14:39.522 --> 14:40.322
I give up.

14:40.604 --> 14:41.686
It's useless.

14:41.989 --> 14:45.195
The magic protecting this
ribbon is just too powerful.

14:45.621 --> 14:48.232
I guess the Snow Queen meant
what she said about her love.

14:48.463 --> 14:49.192
I'm sorry. [Claw clatters]

14:49.207 --> 14:51.906
I was too busy thinking of ways
to punch her to retain that.

14:51.921 --> 14:52.887
She's said

14:53.456 --> 14:55.898
the love flowing through our ribbons was

14:55.975 --> 14:57.171
without equal.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.352
Maybe without equal,

15:02.070 --> 15:05.302
but not without an opposite
that's equally strong.

15:05.790 --> 15:06.647
What?

15:06.767 --> 15:10.624
If her amplified love put
these ribbons on our wrists,

15:10.744 --> 15:12.460
then maybe what we need

15:12.532 --> 15:15.328
is someone's equally amplified
hatred to get them off.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.918
Emma you're a bit prickly, but

15:17.118 --> 15:18.251
you're certainly not hateable.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.554
Tell that to Regina.

15:20.042 --> 15:21.151
I'm prickly?

15:21.271 --> 15:24.182
If you let Regina out while she's under
the influence of the Snow Queen's curse,

15:24.218 --> 15:27.104
- she'll kill you.
- She'll try. But right now, it's...

15:27.112 --> 15:29.501
- A theory.
- The best chance we have.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.322
If Storybrooke wants to survive,

15:32.354 --> 15:35.930
Regina needs to hate me like
she's never hated me before.

- Okay.

Let's see what you won.

17:12.313 --> 17:13.587
I love it.

17:14.517 --> 17:17.162
See, this is a great lesson, Emma.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.446
If you push yourself and you
ignore the flickering lights

17:19.487 --> 17:21.378
and the distractions of this world,

17:21.450 --> 17:23.483
you can accomplish anything.

17:23.551 --> 17:25.779
Ingrid, it's a plastic ring,

17:25.810 --> 17:27.391
not a scholarship to Yale.

17:27.431 --> 17:30.733
I know, but you're a special girl, Emma.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.661
And someday, you're
gonna surprise everybody

17:34.693 --> 17:36.713
with your extraordinary gifts.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.413
Okay, now you're going overboard.

No, just...

- That's why we spent the day together.
- No.

- It's why you're crying.
- No. You couldn't be more wrong.

22:46.893 --> 22:50.348
of a great self-revelation?

22:55.066 --> 22:56.417
I think it's time.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.196
What are you doing?!

22:59.535 --> 23:01.451
- Stop the car.
- What?!

23:01.483 --> 23:02.509
Trust your instincts.

23:02.509 --> 23:04.000
- [Horn honks]
- Do it! Stop the car!

23:04.024 --> 23:05.275
- Let go of me!
- [Tires screech]

23:05.323 --> 23:07.888
- Emma!
- [Horn honks and blares]

23:10.173 --> 23:10.943
I'm sorry.

23:10.975 --> 23:12.402
Are you crazy?!

23:12.434 --> 23:14.790
- You almost killed me!
- I made a mistake.

23:14.806 --> 23:17.508
When I was younger, I...
I had a traumatic experience

23:17.516 --> 23:20.842
that unleashed a power that I...
I didn't even know that I had.

23:20.866 --> 23:21.964
What are you talking about?

23:21.984 --> 23:23.843
I thought the arcade was a sign

23:23.873 --> 23:25.607
that you were coming into your own.

23:25.934 --> 23:28.820
You think I have powers? Like Harry Potter?

23:28.845 --> 23:31.096
No, Emma. That's fiction.

23:31.216 --> 23:34.630
What you have is more
real and more powerful

23:34.649 --> 23:36.624
than you can possibly imagine.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.458
Great.

23:38.855 --> 23:41.036
I should've known the only
person willing to adopt me

23:41.156 --> 23:42.645
would turn out to be a nut job.

23:43.203 --> 23:45.627
- No. Emma...
- Don't touch me!

23:46.929 --> 23:48.712
[Voice breaks] I thought...

23:51.803 --> 23:53.573
Emma, wait.

23:55.972 --> 23:57.312
Emma!

23:59.685 --> 24:02.128
Emma! [Panting]

24:04.693 --> 24:06.040
Emma!

24:09.490 --> 24:10.786
Ugh!

24:13.117 --> 24:15.160
Well, well, well.

24:15.391 --> 24:17.751
Isn't this my lucky day?

24:18.122 --> 24:20.323
<i>I had come here to kill Emma,</i>

24:20.554 --> 24:21.785
but now I get to kill

24:21.811 --> 24:23.394
the two idiots who started it all.

24:23.401 --> 24:26.292
Hey, I wasn't the one that told
Cora about your secret boyfriend.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.664
- Are you selling me out?
- Shut up!

24:29.138 --> 24:31.150
<i>You both deserve to die.</i>

24:31.270 --> 24:35.219
<i>Not just for what you
did, but for your whining.</i>

24:35.992 --> 24:38.693
But your punishments
should fit your crimes.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.878
Mary Margaret, you took
my first true love from me.

24:42.998 --> 24:45.611
Now I'm going to return the favor

24:46.164 --> 24:48.120
by taking your baby.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.491
No! Regina!

24:49.523 --> 24:51.382
Please, Your Majesty, let's be reasonable.

24:51.414 --> 24:52.857
You're under the Snow Queen's spell.

24:52.889 --> 24:54.741
You don't actually hate
Mary Margaret and David.

24:54.749 --> 24:56.296
It does sound like she has her reasons.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.107
- [Whispers] Kristoff!
- I don't know who you are,

24:58.147 --> 25:00.050
but why don't you go back
to where you came from?

25:00.117 --> 25:02.051
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

25:03.013 --> 25:04.808
Where was I?

25:04.928 --> 25:06.900
<i>- [Whoosh]
- [Cell unlocks]</i>

25:07.638 --> 25:09.466
[Door clanks]

25:09.738 --> 25:11.510
Gonna use your magic, Regina?

25:12.191 --> 25:13.586
You afraid to get your hands dirty?

25:13.626 --> 25:15.614
I don't need magic to kill you.

25:15.967 --> 25:18.051
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

25:19.136 --> 25:20.921
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

25:21.154 --> 25:24.208
Magic is too good for you.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.913
I want to watch you bleed.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.345
<i>Apprentice: Take this.</i>

25:45.698 --> 25:48.183
<i>When the time comes...</i>

25:48.768 --> 25:51.341
<i>It will lead you to your third sister.</i>

25:51.589 --> 25:54.307
[Crickets chirping]

26:04.855 --> 26:06.314
[Exhales sharply]

26:16.406 --> 26:18.338
Hello, Storybrooke.

26:23.532 --> 26:27.612
You two have no idea how long
I've waited for this moment.

26:29.681 --> 26:30.909
Your ribbons...

26:31.356 --> 26:33.825
- what have you done?
- I'm not much for accessories.

26:33.945 --> 26:36.198
Those ribbons joined us together.

26:36.318 --> 26:37.279
Get it through your head, lady.

26:37.315 --> 26:39.323
We're not your sisters and
we're never gonna love you.

26:39.884 --> 26:41.512
Oh, Emma.

26:41.632 --> 26:43.922
I know that you actually
believe that. And...

26:45.159 --> 26:46.538
it makes me sad.

26:46.801 --> 26:48.583
But I know that sadness won't last

26:48.588 --> 26:51.702
because soon, you'll see you're wrong.

26:52.020 --> 26:52.938
Don't do it!

26:58.163 --> 26:59.186
The hell are those?

26:59.254 --> 27:00.492
They're memories

27:00.774 --> 27:02.604
I took from the two of you.

27:02.986 --> 27:04.974
And now it's time to give them back.

27:05.494 --> 27:07.777
Why? So we can remember just
how badly you treated us?

27:07.841 --> 27:10.405
The funny thing about time
is we romanticize the good

27:10.418 --> 27:11.341
and forget the bad.

27:11.461 --> 27:14.138
That's exactly what's in these crystals.

27:14.587 --> 27:16.748
These are the good memories

27:17.062 --> 27:18.576
and nothing else.

27:18.806 --> 27:21.577
Lovely moments the two
of you shared with me,

27:21.609 --> 27:25.423
which I'll cherish forever
and now so will you.

27:25.664 --> 27:26.810
I hate to break it to you,

27:26.850 --> 27:28.365
but magic can't make someone love you.

27:28.381 --> 27:31.595
You're right, Emma. Magic
can't create love. But

27:31.715 --> 27:33.607
if someone loved you in the past,

27:33.639 --> 27:35.627
it can make them love you again.

27:35.643 --> 27:37.903
And I know you've forgotten, Emma,

27:38.023 --> 27:40.147
<i>but you did love me.</i>

27:40.171 --> 27:41.727
You both did.

27:43.563 --> 27:45.190
That's why...

27:45.631 --> 27:47.250
Right now,

27:48.100 --> 27:50.304
you're not doing anything.

27:51.707 --> 27:56.966
We all know the only way
to stop me is to kill me,

27:57.695 --> 27:59.746
and you're both...

28:00.219 --> 28:02.223
hesitating.

28:06.192 --> 28:08.757
You don't have it in you.

28:14.704 --> 28:16.067
Still open?

28:16.187 --> 28:19.610
I need a couple of pints for
my son. He loves this place.

28:21.526 --> 28:22.944
Ingrid.

28:23.064 --> 28:24.339
Emma.

28:24.651 --> 28:25.878
What the hell are you doing here?

28:25.894 --> 28:28.635
E... ever since you came
to Storybrooke, I've been

28:28.932 --> 28:31.337
waiting for you to come into my shop.

28:31.457 --> 28:34.856
I wanted to give you your
space, let you come to me.

28:34.976 --> 28:36.154
My space?

28:36.178 --> 28:38.270
Are you out of your mind?
Are you following me?

28:38.321 --> 28:40.208
There's so many things
that I wanted to tell you,

28:40.229 --> 28:41.696
so many things that I wanted to say.

28:41.732 --> 28:43.898
- And look at you. You're all grown up.
- Don't touch me!

28:44.018 --> 28:45.185
This makes no sense.

28:45.442 --> 28:47.699
You don't look a day older.
That was over 10 years ago.

28:47.751 --> 28:50.824
After you ran away, I came to
Storybrooke to wait for you.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.419
And people don't age here the way they do

28:52.439 --> 28:53.871
in a world without magic.

28:53.991 --> 28:55.425
The Apprentice was right.

28:55.445 --> 28:57.790
He said that you would be
here on your 28th birthday,

28:57.831 --> 29:00.318
- and here you are.
- The Apprentice? Magic?

29:00.328 --> 29:01.929
You're even loonier than when I ran away.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.521
I'm not, Emma. You know
that this place is special.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.203
<i>You know that you're special.</i>

29:07.224 --> 29:09.384
Everything that Henry
is telling you is true.

29:09.407 --> 29:11.893
No. I know you screwed
up my life. You're crazy.

29:11.908 --> 29:14.463
Crazy then, crazy now!
You tried to kill me!

29:14.583 --> 29:15.633
Get out of my way.

29:15.674 --> 29:18.439
- I'm gonna call Sheriff Graham.
- No, you're not calling anyone.

29:19.311 --> 29:20.347
What's that, your pet rock?

29:20.467 --> 29:22.985
No, Emma. No, it isn't.

29:23.169 --> 29:25.021
It's magic from my world.

29:26.314 --> 29:29.664
<i>[Whoosh, humming]</i>

29:36.498 --> 29:37.334
Oh.

29:37.903 --> 29:39.001
You okay?

29:39.268 --> 29:42.110
- What happened?
- You slipped. You almost fell.

29:42.167 --> 29:43.670
Do... do you still want that ice cream?

29:44.142 --> 29:46.605
Yeah. Two pints of cherry vanilla.

29:46.841 --> 29:48.241
How about some rocky road?

29:48.309 --> 29:51.207
Uh, on the house. You
look like you could use it.

29:51.545 --> 29:52.712
Have a taste.

29:54.952 --> 29:56.209
[Chuckles]

29:57.784 --> 29:59.343
<i>[Mouth full] Now that is rocky road.</i>

29:59.364 --> 30:01.164
- [Laughs]
- It's delicious.

30:01.284 --> 30:02.734
Wanna know my secret?

30:03.668 --> 30:04.930
Lot of patience.

30:05.474 --> 30:06.495
Lot of love.

30:08.301 --> 30:09.195
[Chuckles]

30:14.298 --> 30:16.560
[Swords clanking]

30:17.288 --> 30:20.311
Careful! The stroller's
not under warranty anymore!

30:20.363 --> 30:22.548
- You said you bought it new!
- It was gently used!

30:22.578 --> 30:24.847
[Groans] Uhh!

30:25.303 --> 30:27.631
Let me know when you're tired
of missing, Mary Margaret.

30:27.683 --> 30:28.970
I only have to hit you once.

30:29.038 --> 30:30.539
- [Clank]
- Uhh!

30:36.393 --> 30:38.113
[Grunts]

30:40.750 --> 30:42.242
- Uhh!
- [Thud]

30:48.972 --> 30:50.167
My, my.

30:50.562 --> 30:52.183
Aren't you a good a sleeper?

30:52.214 --> 30:53.840
You think this spell has made me angry?

30:54.358 --> 30:58.032
<i>Do not wake my baby!</i>

31:07.210 --> 31:09.354
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

31:12.596 --> 31:14.551
[Panting] You said no magic.

31:15.218 --> 31:17.368
And you said you could keep a secret!

31:18.312 --> 31:21.021
I... was... 10!

31:21.570 --> 31:23.051
[Loud clatter]

31:23.925 --> 31:25.249
Where did she send us?

31:26.069 --> 31:28.178
She tried to send us back
to where we came from,

31:28.188 --> 31:29.558
and this was the closest spot.

31:30.164 --> 31:31.493
Where are you going?

31:31.508 --> 31:34.119
I'm going back to Arendelle,
even if I have to swim there.

31:34.134 --> 31:35.775
I don't think that's how portals work.

31:35.949 --> 31:37.883
I mean, sure, I've only
ever been through one,

31:37.914 --> 31:39.443
but they seem pretty one-way.

31:39.489 --> 31:41.095
I'm tired of this!

31:41.290 --> 31:43.846
My life used to be simple...

31:44.041 --> 31:45.806
just me and Sven.

31:45.926 --> 31:49.049
No sister-in-law who
sets off eternal winters.

31:49.064 --> 31:51.640
No crazy aunt who wants
to kill everyone I know.

31:51.686 --> 31:55.119
No fiancée who delays
my wedding for 30 years!

31:55.119 --> 31:56.443
That wasn't my fault.

31:56.563 --> 31:58.231
Okay, the first few weeks were,

31:58.238 --> 32:00.249
but we were frozen for the rest of it!

32:00.279 --> 32:01.023
- [Clink]
- Uhh!

32:01.023 --> 32:03.172
You know what? I'm tired
of listening to you,

32:03.203 --> 32:04.788
- and I'm tired of listening to reason.
- [Exhales deeply]

32:04.814 --> 32:07.122
I'm going back, and
nothing you do will stop me!

32:07.242 --> 32:09.908
Sorry, Kristoff, but you'll thank me later.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.925
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

32:12.045 --> 32:13.375
Close your eyes.

32:13.443 --> 32:14.376
[Bottle shatters]

32:30.560 --> 32:31.577
[Whispers] Kristoff.

32:31.697 --> 32:34.348
Kristoff, do you have
any idea what this is?!

32:34.661 --> 32:37.472
Oh. Right. I knocked you out.

32:38.001 --> 32:40.469
Wake up! We have to take this to Elsa!

32:40.925 --> 32:43.650
Mwah! I love you! You're amazing!

32:43.673 --> 32:44.758
You're unconscious.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.887
I'll be right back. Stay here.

32:46.953 --> 32:48.298
I mean, I know you'll stay here,

32:48.349 --> 32:50.378
but I'll be be right back anyway!

32:54.654 --> 32:55.621
It's okay.

32:57.404 --> 32:58.363
Come.

32:59.266 --> 33:00.918
Be my sisters.

33:01.256 --> 33:03.914
[Grunts] I can't do it,
Emma. I can't hurt her.

33:03.928 --> 33:05.811
<i>- Yeah, well, I can.
- Anna: Wait!</i>

33:05.860 --> 33:06.870
- Stop!
- Anna!

33:06.886 --> 33:08.242
No, she's too dangerous.

33:08.242 --> 33:10.623
You should listen to my sister and go.

33:10.631 --> 33:12.138
<i>Your sister? She's mine.</i>

33:12.178 --> 33:14.190
And whatever you're gonna do? Well...

33:14.310 --> 33:15.416
Don't.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.459
Elsa, I found this on the beach.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.677
It's from our mother.

33:20.152 --> 33:22.365
She must've thrown it into the ocean

33:22.389 --> 33:23.508
before their ship sank.

33:23.552 --> 33:25.489
It came over in the portal with us.

33:25.609 --> 33:26.605
Oh, just be careful.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.867
No, I'm not gonna be careful.
She needs to hear this.

33:28.987 --> 33:30.054
You all do.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.556
"Elsa, Anna,

33:31.568 --> 33:33.947
I don't know if your father
and I will ever get back to you,

33:33.979 --> 33:35.127
but I need you to know

33:35.160 --> 33:37.987
we were wrong to tell Elsa
to conceal her powers."

33:38.000 --> 33:40.771
How fitting that you, who
are so much like your mother,

33:40.809 --> 33:42.153
should share her last words.

33:42.178 --> 33:43.709
"I feel terrible that it happened before

33:43.725 --> 33:45.215
and I can't let it happen again."

33:45.724 --> 33:46.286
What?

33:46.311 --> 33:49.689
"My sister Ingrid, like
you, also had ice powers.

33:50.050 --> 33:52.927
I never told you about her
or my other sister Helga,

33:52.972 --> 33:54.228
but I should have.

33:54.462 --> 33:57.651
They were beautiful and kind and wonderful,

33:57.771 --> 33:59.271
and I was fearful.

33:59.339 --> 34:01.070
"And I let that fear guide me.

34:01.141 --> 34:02.807
"I let Ingrid hide when

34:02.876 --> 34:06.085
I should have celebrated
her for the person she was.

34:06.446 --> 34:07.879
I loved her so much."

34:07.899 --> 34:09.155
You're lying!

34:09.581 --> 34:12.311
My sister hated me!
She called me a monster!

34:12.664 --> 34:15.098
She put me in that urn, like you did Elsa!

34:15.114 --> 34:18.581
"In this crystal are the
memories of my sisters,

34:18.591 --> 34:20.790
"which I stole from
the people of Arendelle.

34:21.254 --> 34:22.768
"Please return them.

34:22.933 --> 34:25.958
"My sisters deserve to be known.

34:26.078 --> 34:28.581
"In a cave in the north valley,

34:28.606 --> 34:31.043
"you'll find an urn that contains Ingrid.

34:31.118 --> 34:33.966
"Please do what I should have
done long ago and release her.

34:34.286 --> 34:37.192
"When you see her, please tell her

34:38.306 --> 34:40.806
"I love her and I'm sorry.

34:42.103 --> 34:45.121
"I'd give anything to take back what I did,

34:45.621 --> 34:48.380
to hold her hands one more time."

34:57.355 --> 34:58.524
- Ingrid!
- Let her go!

35:00.376 --> 35:02.104
[Strained voice] I understand, Aunt Ingrid.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.443
I understand now why you cast this curse.

35:04.784 --> 35:06.311
[Chokes] But you can come back from it.

35:06.327 --> 35:07.485
Understand me?

35:07.862 --> 35:09.160
How could you?

35:09.426 --> 35:10.924
You're nothing like me!

35:10.940 --> 35:13.464
<i>You understand nothing!</i>

35:13.464 --> 35:14.966
You're right. [Inhales sharply]

35:15.086 --> 35:17.691
I'm not like you. My
mother wasn't like you.

35:17.756 --> 35:20.732
But if she was able to love
you for who you are, so can I.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.085
You're a part of our family no matter what.

35:23.639 --> 35:27.094
And family never gives up on each other.

35:27.214 --> 35:30.054
You lie!

35:31.852 --> 35:33.951
Anna: [Gasping]

35:37.528 --> 35:40.011
[Coughs, panting]

35:43.671 --> 35:44.784
[Gasps] Oh.

35:49.729 --> 35:51.773
<i>[Hums]</i>

35:56.325 --> 35:57.400
[Gasps]

35:58.008 --> 35:59.710
[Crying]

36:07.595 --> 36:09.376
[Voice breaks] Oh, Gerda.

36:15.015 --> 36:16.341
[Whispers] Oh.

36:17.613 --> 36:19.131
What have I done?

36:23.261 --> 36:25.144
I need to reverse this.

36:26.995 --> 36:27.906
You can't.

36:28.095 --> 36:30.205
- The only way is if you...
- I know.

36:31.563 --> 36:33.431
I have to destroy myself.

36:33.812 --> 36:35.360
No, Ingrid. Wait!

36:35.480 --> 36:37.088
There's no other way.

36:38.118 --> 36:39.477
<i>I am a monster,</i>

36:39.830 --> 36:41.270
not because of my powers,

36:41.315 --> 36:44.147
but because of what I
let them turn me into.

36:44.267 --> 36:46.150
I have to undo this.

36:46.347 --> 36:47.812
[Voice breaks] No, Ingrid. You'll die.

36:47.849 --> 36:49.438
I know.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.670
It's okay.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.408
Elsa, Anna,

36:54.979 --> 36:56.386
you found each other.

36:56.580 --> 36:59.549
And, Emma, you found your family,

36:59.986 --> 37:02.895
even if it wasn't with me.

37:06.296 --> 37:07.761
You...

37:08.848 --> 37:10.580
You deserve your memories.

37:24.658 --> 37:28.446
You three are so special.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.415
Never forget that.

37:30.859 --> 37:32.152
Oh!

37:32.948 --> 37:34.343
There has to be another way.

37:34.343 --> 37:36.014
You deserve your happy ending, too.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.053
Long ago,

37:38.217 --> 37:39.936
a prophecy told me

37:40.056 --> 37:43.373
that you would lead me to just that, Emma.

37:44.953 --> 37:46.258
And this is it.

37:47.416 --> 37:49.020
All I wanted

37:49.423 --> 37:52.558
was to have my sister's love, and...

37:53.872 --> 37:55.550
Now I have it.

37:56.777 --> 37:57.701
Now...

37:58.682 --> 38:00.709
I get to join them.

38:06.487 --> 38:08.116
[Girls giggling]

38:25.948 --> 38:28.731
She sacrificed herself
for us, for all of us.

38:30.483 --> 38:31.386
Anna.

38:31.571 --> 38:32.601
Elsa.

38:43.474 --> 38:46.187
We must follow through
on our mother's last wish.

38:48.322 --> 38:51.596
We must bring back the
memory of Ingrid and Helga

38:51.609 --> 38:53.654
- to the people of Arendelle.
- We will.

39:01.499 --> 39:03.781
Happy: [Shouts indistinctly] Get off me!

39:03.826 --> 39:05.466
Uhh! Aah!

39:05.734 --> 39:08.579
Doc: Don't you sneeze
on me, you son of a gun!

39:08.636 --> 39:09.856
Hey, what are you doing?!

39:10.158 --> 39:14.194
[Wind howling]

39:14.261 --> 39:17.063
[Shouting stops]

39:25.655 --> 39:27.006
Mary Margaret and Regina: [Grunt]

39:27.276 --> 39:28.541
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

39:29.201 --> 39:30.781
[Swords clatter]

39:31.241 --> 39:32.712
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

39:41.133 --> 39:42.504
What am I wearing?

39:44.368 --> 39:45.521
[Laughs]

39:47.594 --> 39:50.065
[All laughing]

40:02.426 --> 40:05.771
- Sorry I tried to kill you.
- With a crossbow.

40:06.022 --> 40:08.156
Yeah. [Chuckles] You tried
to kill me with a crossbow.

40:08.177 --> 40:09.884
- Happy: Yeah.
- Leroy: [Laughs]

40:11.878 --> 40:13.097
Mary Margaret: Emma!

40:14.242 --> 40:16.319
- Emma: [Whispers] Mom.
- [Laughs]

40:18.223 --> 40:19.179
Henry: Mom!

40:19.815 --> 40:20.759
Henry.

40:21.448 --> 40:22.200
Oh.

40:23.567 --> 40:24.585
Oh!

40:27.339 --> 40:28.391
And mom.

40:28.849 --> 40:30.233
Neal: [Fusses]

40:31.210 --> 40:33.863
- And he's finally waking.
- Oh! Hey.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.017
[Coos]

40:35.137 --> 40:37.406
Look, I know that we were under
the Snow Queen's curse, but...

40:37.438 --> 40:39.617
We were under a curse.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.438
It's okay.

40:41.984 --> 40:43.573
Oh.

41:07.186 --> 41:08.629
[Door bell jingles]

41:09.206 --> 41:10.601
[Door closes]

41:12.421 --> 41:13.816
Henry got away.

41:14.794 --> 41:16.309
So you failed.

41:16.814 --> 41:18.545
At kidnapping a child.

41:19.002 --> 41:21.447
Well, perhaps you could
say my heart wasn't in it.

41:21.888 --> 41:24.212
The Snow Queen's plan also failed.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.749
But mine won't.

41:28.076 --> 41:30.096
Enjoy this snowfall, dearie.

41:30.818 --> 41:32.453
It'll be your last.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.778
Then grant me one dying wish.

41:34.818 --> 41:37.111
I'm not in the business of
making deals with you anymore.

41:37.231 --> 41:40.742
Leave Emma and the rest of Storybrooke be.

41:40.927 --> 41:42.177
There's no need to harm them.

41:42.297 --> 41:45.271
When I step over that town
line with my magic intact,

41:45.391 --> 41:49.559
<i>Emma and Storybrooke have
nothing to fear from me...</i>

41:52.316 --> 41:54.643
As long as they don't get in my way.

41:56.148 --> 41:58.056
But I can't make that same promise

41:58.071 --> 41:59.749
for the rest of the world.

42:09.438 --> 42:10.825
