WEBVTT

00:50.416 --> 00:51.958
Hey. I'm Norman.

00:52.916 --> 00:54.458
That's not me exactly.

00:54.541 --> 00:57.541
It's just a horrible drawing
of me, done by me.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.208
Anyways, I'm here
trying to think of

01:00.250 --> 01:02.541
an idea for my science
presentation.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.416
Maybe I'll do it on satellites,

01:05.458 --> 01:08.666
or the habitation
of other planets.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.458
Or I could do it on the evidence

01:11.500 --> 01:13.458
of extraterrestrial life.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.291
Or maybe I'll just do it
about Charlene.

01:18.916 --> 01:23.375
She's this girl I like.
Man, is she beautiful.

01:24.416 --> 01:26.208
No, no really, she is.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.458
Don't let my terrible drawing
skills fool you.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.791
Uh, back to the
actual task at hand.

01:32.583 --> 01:33.958
I think I'm going to
do the presentation

01:34.000 --> 01:36.250
about life on other planets.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.583
Yeah, because, in my opinion,
aliens are our only hope

01:39.625 --> 01:41.416
of fixing the mess we've
gotten the world into.

01:43.416 --> 01:44.958
No, really, hear me out!

01:45.208 --> 01:47.875
Aliens are super smart. Fact.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.333
Ever read a comic
about a dumb alien?

01:50.458 --> 01:53.166
I like comics too by the way,
not sure if I mentioned that.

01:53.416 --> 01:55.000
Uh, yeah, right.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.500
But what is the problem
of global warming

01:57.541 --> 02:00.166
to the advanced technology
of aliens?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.833
But I guess the only question is
would they want to help us?

02:04.875 --> 02:06.041
once they get here?

02:06.416 --> 02:09.500
Well, my opinion,
I guess they would.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.250
Or at least I think I
could convince them.

02:11.375 --> 02:12.666
While you're in fairy tale land

02:12.708 --> 02:14.833
convincing aliens to
save our planet.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.791
Somebody's got to
stop the government

02:16.833 --> 02:18.083
from blowing them
out of the sky!

02:18.166 --> 02:19.708
Virgil!

02:21.208 --> 02:22.208
You know they got that

02:22.250 --> 02:24.583
extra-terrestrial
defense system, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.291
Yeah, yeah, I know.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.500
I've heard
all your conspiracies,

02:28.541 --> 02:30.458
but my theory is scientific.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.333
Well, science is totally
my thing.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.125
Hey dude,
shouldn't you get going?

02:37.166 --> 02:38.583
Tuesdays are a school night.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.416
It's actually Wednesday.

02:41.541 --> 02:44.500
Wait, what?
Oh, far out.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.083
Anyway, I still have to decide
on the title

02:47.125 --> 02:48.750
for the group presentation
tomorrow.

02:49.666 --> 02:53.416
I mean, you know there's
got to be life on other planets.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.666
Well, why don't you
just go with that one?

02:58.291 --> 03:02.583
Speak from the heart, Norman.
Speak from the heart.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.916
Okay, guys, you ready?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.000
We're only going to get
one shot at this.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.166
So let's run through our plan
one last time.

03:40.875 --> 03:44.750
First, we go in stealthy,
and plant the disruptor device.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.708
Check!

03:45.875 --> 03:49.333
Before Zolthard can discharge
his mind manipulator,

03:49.458 --> 03:52.250
on those helpless little
Erdorian creatures.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.416
Next, we get out of there
as fast as possible,

03:55.875 --> 03:58.000
without getting blown to bits,
of course.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.875
And we take this wormhole,
not that one

04:00.916 --> 04:02.833
to the nearest
Galactic Safe Zone

04:02.875 --> 04:05.458
and disappear without a trace.

04:05.791 --> 04:09.458
Mission completed.
Zolthard defeated.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.416
Why not throw in
a nice promotion for you

04:11.458 --> 04:12.291
while you're at it?

04:12.458 --> 04:14.166
I'm glad you brought it up.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.458
And after the ceremony, we'll
take a well-deserved break,

04:17.500 --> 04:19.958
on a tropical island planet
somewhere.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.541
You wish!

04:21.750 --> 04:23.583
Are we all on the same page?

04:23.625 --> 04:24.791
Let's do this.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.500
Gus, take us into stealth mode.

04:27.750 --> 04:28.833
Okay.

04:30.541 --> 04:31.750
Going dark.

04:37.875 --> 04:41.166
If Zolthard takes control of the
Erdorian High Council,

04:41.291 --> 04:43.833
that's it
for the entire universe.

04:44.125 --> 04:45.625
Initializing approach sequence.

04:45.791 --> 04:48.375
Remind me again why we were
assigned this ship.

04:48.416 --> 04:49.833
We don't have much choice.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.583
This is the only ship
in the fleet small enough

04:52.625 --> 04:54.541
to evade Zolthard’s detection.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.333
This thing is huge.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.041
Put us down close
to one of those pylons.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.666
We can try to gain access
through the maintenance panel.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.625
Okay, Sophie,
take us down!

05:19.416 --> 05:20.666
This better work.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.083
Can any of you tell me why

05:34.125 --> 05:37.041
we haven't taken control
of this planet yet?

05:37.125 --> 05:40.333
Sir, the mind manipulator
has been initialized.

05:40.875 --> 05:43.166
Let's get on
with the invasion then.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.708
Activating Pylon One.

05:45.958 --> 05:46.875
Whagh!

05:46.916 --> 05:47.541
Sir.

05:47.791 --> 05:48.958
What!

05:49.041 --> 05:51.000
Pylon One online.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.958
Engage!

05:53.041 --> 05:54.791
Activating Pylon Two.

05:55.958 --> 05:57.750
Mindless metal!

06:03.000 --> 06:06.291
Sir, the planet has
deployed its defensive systems.

06:06.333 --> 06:10.250
Well, that's not
going to save them.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.791
Hurry up, Sophie.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.625
They're almost done with
the start-up sequence.

06:23.666 --> 06:25.375
Activating Pylon Three.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.166
At last!

06:29.250 --> 06:31.125
Activating Pylon Four.

06:35.041 --> 06:40.208
Hagh! Hagh!
How many pylons are there?

06:41.541 --> 06:43.750
Pylon Four online.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.125
Sophie, keep the
power flow open

06:48.166 --> 06:49.416
once the connection is made,

06:49.458 --> 06:52.708
and make sure you give yourself
enough time to get away.

06:52.833 --> 06:53.666
Copy.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.208
We're running out of time!

06:58.541 --> 07:01.375
I just need a few more seconds.

07:02.541 --> 07:04.750
Pylon Five online.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.083
Fire!

07:31.416 --> 07:33.583
Yeagh!!

07:38.500 --> 07:40.041
Max!

07:41.625 --> 07:44.250
Those pesky peace keepers!

07:44.916 --> 07:48.166
Someone better
explain this to me!

07:48.416 --> 07:51.708
Zolthard Sir,
at least their ship is damaged.

07:51.750 --> 07:52.083
We can dispatch...

07:53.125 --> 07:56.958
Now, this time
I'll take care of it myself.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.333
Ready my personal ship!

07:59.541 --> 08:01.250
Sir, yes, Sir.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.041
These peace keepers will learn
the meaning of war.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.791
Crush them!

08:21.125 --> 08:22.083
We're not in range.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.958
Aargh! Mother of tentacles!

08:25.041 --> 08:28.583
Always at the mercy
of mindless metal.

08:30.333 --> 08:34.500
All stations prepare
for my imminent return!

08:34.791 --> 08:37.125
My final victory over these

08:37.166 --> 08:40.416
officials of incompetence
is at hand!

08:40.625 --> 08:45.333
And then we will
resume the invasion.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.708
Whoa!

08:59.833 --> 09:01.375
How far is it to this wormhole?

09:01.416 --> 09:02.958
There's no way
we're going to make it.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.666
-Hold this!
-Gus!

09:04.958 --> 09:06.541
There is another option.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.333
What are you talking about?

09:08.875 --> 09:11.291
The Hole of the Lost.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.708
Are you out of your mind?

09:14.583 --> 09:16.583
The wormhole
is strictly off limits!

09:16.625 --> 09:19.500
Anyone who's ever gone down
that hole, has never returned.

09:19.541 --> 09:20.541
I don't think we have a choice.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.125
The chief will kill me if
anything happens to the ship.

09:23.791 --> 09:26.458
Guys, if we take
one more hit, we'll be toast!

09:28.583 --> 09:30.041
-What the?
-Gus!

09:30.250 --> 09:32.208
Vengeance is mine!

09:32.416 --> 09:33.416
I can fix this.

09:33.458 --> 09:34.916
If I reroute the
ship's power from the

09:34.958 --> 09:36.250
trash compactor
unit to the auxiliary--

09:36.291 --> 09:39.000
Whatever you're going to do,
do it now!

09:39.041 --> 09:40.166
Okay!

09:45.875 --> 09:47.916
That's more like it.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.000
Hang on!

09:54.791 --> 09:57.041
Oh no, they're almost on us!

10:02.416 --> 10:03.916
We are now in range, Sir.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.916
Open the
communications frequency.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.916
Incoming transmission from
Zolthard's ship?

10:10.291 --> 10:11.416
Put him on the screen.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.833
Surrender!
Or I will pulverize you!

10:15.875 --> 10:18.500
Zolthard! We both know
how this ends.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.458
Can you believe how big
that head is?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.958
Yeah, I know. It's huge.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.125
You think this is funny?

10:24.166 --> 10:26.041
Let's see what you think
about this!

10:29.625 --> 10:32.416
Huh! Phaser beam!

10:38.541 --> 10:40.291
Well, I refuse to just sit here

10:40.333 --> 10:42.875
while Zolthard takes
shots at us.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.166
Where are you going?
Argh!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.958
To do something crazy, probably.

10:51.666 --> 10:54.666
I'm detecting debris
coming off the other ship.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.041
What is that?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.250
And that boys, is how it's done.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.833
Good job, Sophie.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.500
Gus, how far are we from that
Hole of the Lost?

11:19.541 --> 11:21.250
We're entering
the gravity field!

11:21.291 --> 11:23.958
I just hope this ship
can hold it together...

11:24.541 --> 11:26.208
Because here goes nothing.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.458
You fools! They're getting away!

11:33.625 --> 11:35.041
Caution. If we follow them,

11:35.083 --> 11:37.625
we'll lose communication
with the Mothership.

11:37.791 --> 11:40.625
I don't care!
After that ship!

11:59.875 --> 12:03.375
Norman!

12:09.625 --> 12:11.875
Norman!

12:11.916 --> 12:14.083
You're going to
miss the bus again.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.708
I missed the bus.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.000
Oh, no, no, no, no. Mom.
Why didn't you wake me?

12:25.208 --> 12:25.833
Ow!

12:32.083 --> 12:34.500
Oh. Ugh!

12:40.666 --> 12:43.416
Good luck
for your presentation, sweetie.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.500
Whoa!!

12:51.291 --> 12:53.416
Don't forget
your lunch, Norman.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.541
Thanks, Mom!

13:00.916 --> 13:02.208
- Hey, wait!
- Check this out.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.208
-Hey, Norman!
-Oh my gosh!

13:05.958 --> 13:07.416
Loser.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.541
Come on, slow down.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.166
Oh, man.

13:12.958 --> 13:13.916
Huh?

13:18.750 --> 13:19.541
Huh!

13:27.250 --> 13:28.416
Try keep up!

13:28.750 --> 13:31.333
Ugh!
Almost there.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.541
Whah!

13:37.583 --> 13:41.541
Hey guys, look at Norman! Look
at what he's wearing!

13:49.666 --> 13:51.833
Norman, are you okay?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.750
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just very
late for school.

13:54.791 --> 13:59.125
You up for a trade, Sandy?
It's cucumber and jelly.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.083
Hmm. All right.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.541
As long as you have it
back to me by tomorrow.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.000
Sure.
No problem.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.791
Goodbye.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.791
Bye! Whoo hoo!

14:54.791 --> 14:56.333
We are here at Hubble High,

14:56.375 --> 14:58.208
where all of the students
are so beautiful,

14:58.250 --> 15:00.208
-Oh no, Alejandro no.
-so exciting-

15:00.250 --> 15:01.041
Alejandro!

15:01.208 --> 15:04.041
And me, Alejandro,
the star of the show!

15:04.083 --> 15:05.708
The host with the most.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.750
There's Mr. Hernandez
with his dodge balls.

15:08.791 --> 15:13.375
And Charlene! So vivacious,
so beautiful, so confident.

15:13.416 --> 15:14.416
Hey, Alejandro.

15:14.458 --> 15:18.375
And Frankie,
so elusive and mysterious.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.541
Has anyone seen Norman?

15:19.583 --> 15:20.791
He probably missed
the bus again.

15:20.833 --> 15:21.250
Again?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.708
Yes, you can really feel
the suspense.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.458
Where is Norman,
and where is our school project?

15:26.625 --> 15:27.125
Oh.

15:27.666 --> 15:31.291
Suddenly, an evil monster
appears out of nowhere.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.208
Oh. Hey, Mike.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.375
Ugh. How are you doing?

15:35.791 --> 15:38.750
Evil monster?
You think you're funny, huh?

15:38.875 --> 15:40.541
Now that you've
come to mention it,

15:40.583 --> 15:43.416
I've always felt that comedy
is one of my many, many talents.

15:43.750 --> 15:47.458
Oh, yeah? Well, meet one
of my many talents.

15:47.666 --> 15:48.791
Wait, watch out!

15:48.958 --> 15:50.416
Ugh! Agh.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.625
I'll deal with you later.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.833
Well, look who finally arrived.
The resident geek.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.000
Oh hey, Mike.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.208
Hey, hey, hey,
easy there, tiger.

16:00.416 --> 16:03.083
Everybody just take
a deep breath.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.125
This isn't over.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.500
The fragile prey
saved by the bell.

16:09.791 --> 16:10.416
Ugh.

16:11.208 --> 16:12.208
What's up with him?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.833
He's always so aggro...
macho-monkey-man.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.291
Thought you were going
to hack the school system

16:16.333 --> 16:18.291
and get mad-Mike transferred.

16:18.750 --> 16:19.750
I'm working on it.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.291
There goes the fire alarm!

16:24.333 --> 16:25.916
Gus, look over there!

16:25.958 --> 16:27.583
Yeah, that might work!

16:29.291 --> 16:33.166
Whoa! I never thought it would
end this way!

16:50.916 --> 16:52.166
Gus, what's our status?

16:52.541 --> 16:54.500
Huh, good news is
the fire is out.

16:55.208 --> 16:55.750
Alright.

16:55.791 --> 16:57.208
The bad news is we’re being
sucked in

16:57.250 --> 16:59.833
by that giant vacuum hose!

16:59.916 --> 17:03.416
Ah, I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

17:03.625 --> 17:07.500
Whaaaaah!

17:09.375 --> 17:10.666
Norman?

17:10.708 --> 17:12.625
Norman, are you okay?

17:12.666 --> 17:14.333
-Quick, stand back.
-Can you breathe?

17:14.375 --> 17:16.833
- He's dying.
- He's not dying.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.000
Thanks, Frankie.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.000
Alejandro, do you have to
film everything?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.333
I am just giving people
what they want.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.416
Okay, let's go to class, guys.

17:28.583 --> 17:29.458
Are you coming?

17:29.708 --> 17:31.000
I'm okay.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.500
Our hero lives
to fight another day.

17:33.541 --> 17:34.875
What did you put in this stuff?

17:38.083 --> 17:39.125
Where did they go?

17:39.208 --> 17:40.625
I’m not picking
anything up

17:40.666 --> 17:42.041
on the scanners, Sir.

17:42.250 --> 17:46.333
Well, they can't be far.
They were on fire!

17:46.625 --> 17:49.500
Sir, we have to find refuge
somewhere.

17:49.541 --> 17:52.583
Engine number two is failing
and we are losing fuel.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.708
Hagh! Those infernal peace
keepers!

17:56.000 --> 17:59.416
Get the invasion fleet
to send help immediately!

17:59.791 --> 18:02.416
Sir, we've lost contact
with the fleet.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.666
What?

18:04.125 --> 18:07.041
Well, then we’ll just have
to find

18:07.083 --> 18:09.458
another way to make contact.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.375
Sir, I suggest we take control
of one of these creatures

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
and use it to build a
communications device.

18:15.541 --> 18:19.291
Look at you! Mindless metal
scraping together an idea.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.875
School's started!

18:20.916 --> 18:22.666
The bell has rung already.

18:22.916 --> 18:26.125
Come now, come now. Hurry up.
We don't have all day!

18:26.333 --> 18:27.500
Scott!

18:28.083 --> 18:31.416
How many times have I told you
to leave that at home?

18:31.583 --> 18:33.000
I'll take that.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.291
You can have it back
when you graduate,

18:35.333 --> 18:38.291
which will probably be never.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.416
Frankie Helman! Get that hair
out of your face!

18:40.583 --> 18:41.625
Hi, Ms. Witherington.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.458
Hi, Charlene.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.333
You! If I told you once-

18:47.375 --> 18:52.000
There! We have found the leader
of this primitive planet.

18:52.041 --> 18:54.625
Plotting shortest route to the
creature’s control centre.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.250
As if you know what to do.

18:57.375 --> 19:01.750
Just get me down there
so that I can take control.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.166
There we go,
on the double.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.125
Yah! Ah, ooh.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.791
Sir, we are ready.

19:12.458 --> 19:16.125
Aah! This is the best part.

19:16.541 --> 19:21.708
Mwhoo hoo hoo... Aaaah!

19:48.166 --> 19:50.333
...you know I was just...

19:50.458 --> 19:51.458
You just what?

19:52.041 --> 19:52.791
I don't know.

19:52.958 --> 19:53.833
Are you okay?

19:53.875 --> 19:56.833
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.916
Looks organic to me.

20:02.958 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, kind of creepy.

20:06.125 --> 20:09.750
Okay, we're inside
a human being.

20:10.333 --> 20:14.416
It's sentient, capable of
abstract thought, language.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.541
Yeah, not bad.
Kind of primitive, but it'll do.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.708
There's an organic
power core right up ahead.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.166
Let's head there.
We can plug in, repair ship,

20:24.208 --> 20:26.958
and try find out
what happened to Zolthard.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.708
Norman?

20:39.750 --> 20:41.208
Are you okay?

20:41.250 --> 20:42.708
You're acting all weird.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.375
I feel kind of weird.

20:45.958 --> 20:50.125
It's as if my brain is itchy
or something.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.750
Wow. That's awesome.

21:00.125 --> 21:03.375
There it is.
The power core.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.166
Huh.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.875
Good morning, everybody.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.291
Settle down.
Settle down, please.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.916
I hope you kids are ready
for your presentations.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.000
Oh, I'm getting
too old for this.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.708
Why can't Gus do this part?

21:31.083 --> 21:33.750
Remember the last time you
programmed the ship's computer?

21:34.333 --> 21:35.708
Oh, yeah.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.291
Right, you ready?

21:38.875 --> 21:40.875
You're probably
going to need this, Max.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.375
Of course.

21:46.916 --> 21:49.333
SPF, open door.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.375
Really, Max?

22:10.833 --> 22:13.000
Okay, I can see you.
Can you hear me?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.083
Roger that.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.791
Yeah, loud and clear.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.958
Let's find out where we are.

22:18.916 --> 22:19.750
There it is.

22:20.041 --> 22:21.083
Okay, according to my scanners,

22:21.125 --> 22:23.208
it should be
right in front of you.

22:24.708 --> 22:27.041
Okay. Here goes.

22:31.500 --> 22:35.041
How about over here?

22:35.458 --> 22:36.333
Huh!

22:36.750 --> 22:37.791
Yes, Norman?

22:38.166 --> 22:39.250
Huh, uh.

22:39.708 --> 22:40.916
Norman?

22:41.291 --> 22:43.250
I... I...

22:43.541 --> 22:45.791
Well, since you're up,
your group may go first.

22:45.958 --> 22:47.416
Argh.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.416
I'm sorry, guys.

22:49.458 --> 22:52.083
Yeah, we're going
to be here 'til lunch.

22:52.541 --> 22:54.125
They're definitely
talking about aliens.

22:54.250 --> 22:55.833
Always.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.333
Oh, yeah.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.125
"WHY WE THINK THERE'S LIFE
ON OTHER PLANETS".

23:06.166 --> 23:08.791
Oh, here we go again.

23:08.916 --> 23:12.500
There are billions of galaxies
in the universe.

23:12.541 --> 23:15.250
Yeah, well I wish
you'd go to one of them.

23:21.708 --> 23:25.166
And each of these galaxies
contains billions of stars.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.541
Over here.

23:28.666 --> 23:30.250
Okay, let's see.

23:30.291 --> 23:33.583
Each of those stars
may have a planet similar...

23:34.250 --> 23:35.125
Uh...

23:35.416 --> 23:38.208
Similar, to our own planet

23:38.250 --> 23:43.708
capable of sustaining
intelligent, uhm

23:43.750 --> 23:44.875
life.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.541
-Hmm.
-Huh.

23:47.791 --> 23:48.625
That is so weird.

23:48.666 --> 23:51.000
Now, now people who
believe in aliens are

23:51.041 --> 23:53.500
often thought of as
weird or eccentric.

23:53.791 --> 23:55.166
Let's see what this baby can do.

23:56.750 --> 24:00.833
We are here to show you today

24:00.875 --> 24:03.416
that we are just the same
as all of you.

24:03.458 --> 24:04.416
What is he doing?

24:04.458 --> 24:05.333
I don't know.

24:06.083 --> 24:06.666
Norman.

24:07.583 --> 24:08.375
-Norman!
-Whoa!

24:08.416 --> 24:09.458
I'm sorry.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.166
What are you doing?

24:12.208 --> 24:13.125
Nothing.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.875
- I will talk you
-Testing, testing.

24:17.083 --> 24:17.750
-through the amazing...
-Do you hear me?

24:17.791 --> 24:18.500
Yes.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.583
-Norman. Thank you.
-Yes? Can you hear that?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.125
-Can I hear what, Norman?
-You can't hear that?

24:22.166 --> 24:24.291
No, thank you, Norman.
You're done.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.791
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.666
Oh, not you.
The voices.

24:29.958 --> 24:32.625
Charlene! Perhaps I should
talk about Area 51 or Roswell?

24:32.666 --> 24:36.208
Hey, Gus. I said, where do
you want me to plug this one in?

24:36.541 --> 24:36.875
No!

24:36.916 --> 24:38.625
Wait a minute.
What's going on here, Charlene.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.541
Plug what in? Don't let them
plug anything in!

24:41.791 --> 24:43.291
Oh wait, here we go.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.583
How's that?

24:55.166 --> 24:56.791
Norman, where are
you going?

25:01.375 --> 25:02.500
Okay Gus, try it now.

25:02.583 --> 25:05.416
Nearly ready.
We should have visuals...

25:06.791 --> 25:08.000
There.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.958
Oh, wow.

25:10.416 --> 25:11.291
Ugh?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.958
Hey look Gus,
it’s your Uncle Zorg!

25:14.250 --> 25:15.208
Very funny.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.708
Actually, it looks a
bit like my ex-wife.

25:19.041 --> 25:20.958
-You remember her, right?
-How can I can forget.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.583
She had tentacles coming out of
her face man! It was everywhere-

25:23.791 --> 25:25.458
Stop!

25:29.958 --> 25:31.208
Thank you.

25:31.625 --> 25:32.458
Don't mention it.

25:32.541 --> 25:34.666
Wait, who are you?

25:34.958 --> 25:36.541
I'm Special Officer Sophie.

25:36.625 --> 25:39.291
I'm even more special,
Captain Max.

25:39.416 --> 25:42.083
I'm Tech Specialist Gus.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.166
I'm Norman.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.791
Hi, Norman.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.291
It's like you're
inside my head... Huh!

25:48.708 --> 25:50.458
Wait! Are you inside my head?

25:50.750 --> 25:51.500
Kid, relax.

25:51.541 --> 25:52.458
Relax?

25:52.708 --> 25:53.958
That's it, I'm going crazy.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.375
They're going to lock me up
in an insane asylum--

25:55.416 --> 25:56.583
We don't have time for this.

25:56.666 --> 25:58.791
My friends are right,
I'm totally crazy right now.

25:59.750 --> 26:00.666
Uh, owww!

26:00.708 --> 26:02.875
Repeat after me, Norman.

26:02.958 --> 26:03.750
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

26:03.791 --> 26:06.125
"There are tiny aliens."

26:06.291 --> 26:08.375
There are tiny aliens.

26:08.416 --> 26:09.958
"Inside my head."

26:10.000 --> 26:11.875
Ah, come on. Ah!

26:12.041 --> 26:13.291
Inside my head!

26:14.291 --> 26:17.791
Uh, oh-- Hey!

26:17.833 --> 26:19.166
Hmm.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.833
Ow, okay, okay, fine, fine.
I believe you.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.000
Now, will you just let go?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.333
Whoop!

26:25.625 --> 26:27.041
What are you doing?

26:27.500 --> 26:28.416
Fine.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.791
Can you please
never do that again?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.333
It's okay, kid.
We're not here to hurt you.

26:35.583 --> 26:37.458
The truth is,
we're kind of stuck in here,

26:37.500 --> 26:38.791
and we need your help.

26:39.291 --> 26:42.083
Well, firstly...

26:42.416 --> 26:45.666
I knew it!
I knew there was life out there.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.875
And now, it's here.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.125
Oh, man.
This is so totally cool.

26:51.708 --> 26:53.958
Wait, what do you mean
you need my help?

26:54.250 --> 26:56.041
Look, I'm really sorry.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.750
We weren't planning
to crash land--

26:57.791 --> 27:00.291
Down my throat?
And now you're in my brain?

27:00.833 --> 27:02.166
This is the tragedy.

27:02.541 --> 27:03.708
How are you going to save Earth

27:03.750 --> 27:06.166
when you're the one
stuck in my head?

27:06.208 --> 27:10.166
Please, Norman. We know
it's not ideal. Trust me.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.083
We just need some time
to repair our ship

27:12.125 --> 27:13.416
and get back to our mission.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.541
What mission?

27:14.625 --> 27:15.708
Norman?

27:15.750 --> 27:16.666
Huh!

27:16.958 --> 27:18.666
Who are you talking to?

27:18.750 --> 27:20.833
Hey, Norman, she's nice.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.541
Oh, yeah, she's great!

27:22.791 --> 27:23.541
Huh?

27:23.625 --> 27:25.083
No, no, no, no.
Not you, shut up.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.666
Norman, don't tell me
to shut up.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.000
No, no, no, no, no, no,
not you.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.250
Then who, Norman?

27:29.416 --> 27:32.250
Uh, the voices... in my head.

27:32.291 --> 27:34.333
Are you going crazy?

27:35.333 --> 27:37.958
Norman! What are you doing
in the girls bathroom?

27:38.375 --> 27:40.166
That is a good question.
I was--

27:40.208 --> 27:42.000
Actually, Mr. Anderson,

27:42.041 --> 27:43.875
what are you doing
in the girls bathroom?

27:43.916 --> 27:45.625
Well, I...

27:46.041 --> 27:48.083
Norman, explain yourself.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.666
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

27:50.791 --> 27:53.166
Well, you can explain it
to Principal Witherington.

27:53.250 --> 27:56.458
-What? No! Man!
-Come with me.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.250
Who's Principal Witherington?

28:04.708 --> 28:07.708
Mm, hmm?

28:08.500 --> 28:10.541
Ugh! Yuck.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.458
Ooh.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.166
Hmm?

28:16.416 --> 28:18.250
Oh!

28:19.666 --> 28:23.000
Huh? Oh! Ah-haa!

28:27.833 --> 28:28.958
Ugh!

28:32.750 --> 28:34.458
Good morning,
Ms. Witherington.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.458
Argh!

28:35.500 --> 28:36.625
Can I help you?

28:36.666 --> 28:38.000
It speaks!

28:38.041 --> 28:40.416
Do you need me
to get hold of someone for you?

28:40.541 --> 28:41.958
Yes! Yes.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.250
I need you to get hold
of the Mothership,

28:45.291 --> 28:46.791
and tell them to send--

28:46.833 --> 28:48.250
Ahem...

28:48.333 --> 28:52.458
Excuse me, Ms. Witherington,
but I need to see you.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.666
Who?

28:53.875 --> 28:57.166
-You. Yes.
-Me?

28:57.375 --> 28:59.625
It's about Norman here.

29:00.333 --> 29:03.291
Nn... Nnn, Nnnn, Nor-man.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.166
That's me.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.000
Uh, Mr?

29:07.041 --> 29:08.625
Mr. Anderson.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.166
You, uh, want me
to phone your Mothership?

29:11.208 --> 29:13.708
-Mothership?
-Mr. Anderson, what do you want?

29:13.958 --> 29:17.833
As you can see,
I'm a very busy man.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.208
- Man?
- Ah!

29:20.250 --> 29:21.583
-Ah! Ah!
-I'm sorry,

29:21.625 --> 29:23.416
-Ah! Ah!
-but it's a discipline problem.

29:23.875 --> 29:29.041
You know, you can't run a Galaxy
without discipline

29:29.083 --> 29:34.000
nor control, that's the key.
Always control.

29:34.791 --> 29:38.125
- Galaxy?
- Hmm? What?

29:38.291 --> 29:39.458
You said Galaxy.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.291
No, I didn't.

29:40.333 --> 29:41.166
Sounded like Galaxy
to me!

29:41.208 --> 29:44.416
No!

29:45.625 --> 29:47.291
What do you want?

29:47.791 --> 29:49.708
Perhaps we should get back
to the problem.

29:49.750 --> 29:53.541
This Principal Witherington
person is acting all...

29:53.583 --> 29:54.416
The problem...

29:54.458 --> 29:55.875
-is that nobody wants to hear.
-Weird!

29:55.916 --> 29:56.875
Yeah.

29:56.916 --> 29:58.625
and if they do
not want to hear--

29:58.666 --> 30:02.750
Doesn't she remind you of
someone we know?

30:04.708 --> 30:05.791
Zolthard!

30:06.291 --> 30:07.791
Zolthard?

30:08.416 --> 30:09.041
Zolthard?

30:09.083 --> 30:10.333
Quiet!

30:12.583 --> 30:15.708
What did you just say?

30:15.750 --> 30:17.833
Norman, get out of there!

30:18.166 --> 30:20.625
I, uh... nothing.

30:20.666 --> 30:23.083
I really should be going.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.416
Norman, what's going on?

30:24.500 --> 30:27.041
One more word from you!

30:28.000 --> 30:30.208
Norman, is it?

30:31.875 --> 30:35.000
Norman, Norman!

30:36.541 --> 30:38.708
Or should I say,

30:39.000 --> 30:39.791
Max!

30:40.083 --> 30:41.708
Whargh!

30:42.125 --> 30:44.000
Oh, I'm really sorry,
Mr. Anderson.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.375
I'll explain later,
but I got to go.

30:45.416 --> 30:47.583
Norman, you stay right here.

30:47.791 --> 30:48.708
Whoa!

30:49.250 --> 30:52.416
Alright, you're mine now.

30:52.458 --> 30:55.791
Huh!

30:56.916 --> 30:57.750
After that boy!

30:57.791 --> 30:59.333
What?

30:59.500 --> 31:00.750
- ...see about that.
-Whoa!

31:01.958 --> 31:02.625
You again?

31:02.875 --> 31:05.166
Now, now, Mike.
Haven't you gotten yourself

31:05.208 --> 31:06.375
into enough trouble already?

31:06.458 --> 31:07.375
Whah!

31:07.708 --> 31:09.375
Yeah, you gotta run!

31:10.916 --> 31:12.708
Mr. Anderson?

31:12.916 --> 31:13.958
Are, are you okay?

31:14.375 --> 31:15.833
What's up with him.

31:15.916 --> 31:19.083
Ms. Witherington,
is everything--

31:19.125 --> 31:21.250
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait!

31:21.458 --> 31:22.875
What are you doing?
No, no no. Wait!

31:22.958 --> 31:24.166
Huh?

31:32.083 --> 31:33.125
Ooh!

31:35.250 --> 31:36.625
-Norman?
-Aah!

31:36.791 --> 31:37.916
What is going on?

31:38.041 --> 31:39.875
I don't know, I can't explain.

31:39.916 --> 31:42.291
You don't know,
or you can't explain?

31:44.291 --> 31:47.000
I'm really sorry, guys,
but I got to get out of here.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.666
What the... Urgh!

31:52.041 --> 31:53.458
Where is she going?

31:54.958 --> 31:56.083
Ugh!

31:56.291 --> 31:57.583
Hey, thanks, man.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.375
-No problem.
-Okay, see you after class.

31:59.541 --> 32:00.500
-Hey, man!
-Sorry.

32:08.541 --> 32:09.666
Mr. Hernandez?

32:12.541 --> 32:16.625
Nowhere to go now?

32:17.916 --> 32:20.291
Norman, I'm taking control!

32:20.583 --> 32:22.291
What again?
No, no, no.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.500
You promised
you wouldn't do it--

32:23.541 --> 32:26.708
Huh.

33:02.250 --> 33:04.000
Oh, my gosh.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.708
-Did you see him?
-OMG, did you see that?

33:06.833 --> 33:08.041
-Norman just--
-Did you--

33:08.083 --> 33:09.833
No way.

33:10.041 --> 33:11.375
Back to you, Norman.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.916
Uhh.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.125
Hey, Soph. Good job.

33:17.208 --> 33:18.375
Piece of cake.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.416
Guys, hostiles at 6 o’clock.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.625
We drained all his power.
What are we going to do?

33:24.208 --> 33:25.916
Norman, get in!

33:26.958 --> 33:27.958
Get in!

33:29.083 --> 33:29.958
Aah!

33:42.708 --> 33:45.166
You fools.
Get after them!

33:46.375 --> 33:47.583
What's wrong with you?

33:51.541 --> 33:53.416
Uh, here.
Drink this.

33:57.291 --> 34:00.166
Thanks, Charlene,
you saved my life.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.958
Yeah, well, unless you want me
to turn this thing around,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.083
you better start telling me
what's going on.

34:05.416 --> 34:07.125
And how did you learn
to move like that?

34:07.250 --> 34:08.583
-Uh-
-Well?

34:08.625 --> 34:10.208
Can't you just give me
a break?

34:10.250 --> 34:11.916
You seriously would not
believe me,

34:11.958 --> 34:12.958
even if I told you.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.416
Norman, how long have we
known each other?

34:15.458 --> 34:17.375
I know, I know!
But still.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.375
I'm not even sure I believe it.

34:24.750 --> 34:25.708
Okay,

34:25.750 --> 34:27.625
so it started when Anderson
caught me in the bathroom--

34:27.666 --> 34:28.625
-Yeah!
-Ow!

34:28.833 --> 34:31.000
- Ugh, oh.
- What the--

34:31.541 --> 34:32.416
Oh, no.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.041
If you surrender now,

34:35.083 --> 34:37.208
Zolthard says he will go
easy on you.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.333
Yes, easy.

34:38.416 --> 34:39.541
Who is Zolthard?

34:39.583 --> 34:40.583
Watch out!

34:41.750 --> 34:43.541
Uh, he's an evil alien
who's taken control

34:43.583 --> 34:45.041
of Principal Witherington.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.791
Seriously, what's going on?

34:46.833 --> 34:49.041
Why are the teachers
chasing after us?

34:49.291 --> 34:51.333
Guys, we need more info here.

34:51.375 --> 34:52.625
Who are you talking to?

34:52.666 --> 34:54.083
The aliens in my head.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.250
Are you kidding me?

34:55.291 --> 34:57.416
No, no, no, no.
I'm being serious, Charlene.

34:57.833 --> 34:58.375
Guys?

34:58.416 --> 35:00.583
Okay, let me explain.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.833
Zolthard is an evil mastermind

35:02.875 --> 35:04.500
who's trying to take over
your planet.

35:04.708 --> 35:05.750
Hold on a second.

35:05.791 --> 35:08.250
And Zolthard wants
galactic domination.

35:08.291 --> 35:09.208
Who am I talking to?

35:09.250 --> 35:11.458
And he's in control
of your teachers.

35:11.750 --> 35:14.041
Okay, but why is he after us?

35:14.250 --> 35:16.916
We stopped him from invading
another planet, so

35:17.166 --> 35:19.791
Now he's out for revenge.
Look out!

35:20.708 --> 35:21.583
Watch out!

35:21.625 --> 35:23.250
Whoa, whoa!

35:24.166 --> 35:26.083
We've got to help them
get rid of these Droids.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.291
He's not up to power yet.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.750
Well, let's try and find
a way out.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.791
Gus, what about that?

35:31.875 --> 35:32.958
Yeah, that might do.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.708
Okay, Norman,
I want you to turn left.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.375
- What?
- Turn left...

35:36.416 --> 35:37.791
NOW!

35:44.125 --> 35:45.708
Charlene!

35:48.958 --> 35:50.625
Look out, get out the way,
get out the way!

35:51.208 --> 35:52.416
-Look out!
-Awh!

35:54.125 --> 35:55.208
What is wrong with you?

35:55.250 --> 35:57.708
I'm sorry, but I think
we slowed them down.

35:57.750 --> 35:58.666
What's wrong with them?

35:58.708 --> 35:59.583
I don't know!

36:03.166 --> 36:05.708
-Uh!
-Ow!

36:05.916 --> 36:07.875
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.291
I think we lost them.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.583
Yeah.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.208
Okay, come on, get it started.

36:13.166 --> 36:13.833
We got to go!

36:13.875 --> 36:15.208
Oh, no.

36:15.250 --> 36:16.625
Yeah, now we're going to
get them.

36:16.666 --> 36:17.833
They're not working!

36:17.916 --> 36:20.166
Come on! Oh, no.
We've got to go.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.166
We've to get out of here!
Now!

36:21.291 --> 36:22.500
Go now, go now, go now!
Go!

36:22.541 --> 36:23.916
Haa!

36:26.291 --> 36:27.500
Go get them.

36:27.541 --> 36:28.291
Wait, are you
kidding me?

36:28.333 --> 36:32.375
Yeah. Yeah.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.500
Hey, stop that!

36:34.958 --> 36:36.791
Okay, kick him.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.125
Get away from me!

36:39.625 --> 36:40.666
Aaah!

36:47.750 --> 36:50.291
-You won't get away.
-Hahaha!

36:50.416 --> 36:51.666
Sophie?

36:52.625 --> 36:53.708
A little help, please.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.583
Leave it to me.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.583
Eeewww!

37:01.541 --> 37:02.583
What are you doing?

37:02.666 --> 37:03.833
Just keep driving
straight.

37:04.000 --> 37:04.750
What?

37:05.041 --> 37:05.791
Huuh!

37:05.833 --> 37:09.541
We got you now!

37:11.916 --> 37:12.916
Aargh.

37:13.416 --> 37:14.625
Ah-ha!

37:16.541 --> 37:19.541
See you later coach!
“Freakazoid”!

37:20.750 --> 37:22.791
Huh? Oh!

37:22.958 --> 37:25.208
Oh no, this is going to hurt.

37:25.666 --> 37:26.750
Ugh! Ooh!

37:29.208 --> 37:29.708
Argh!

37:30.416 --> 37:32.083
You're welcome.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.625
Hmm. This kid's power
doesn't last very long.

37:35.916 --> 37:36.750
Norman?

37:37.416 --> 37:38.458
Norman!

37:39.333 --> 37:42.250
Just get me to Virgil's.
He'll know what to do.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.083
Hey, guys.
Look what I found.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.833
Yeah, that's a Requiem 2000.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.708
Whoa!

37:49.791 --> 37:52.833
You and me are going to
get along just fine.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.416
It is useless, you know?

37:54.458 --> 37:54.958
What?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.333
Yeah. Power pack's missing.

37:56.416 --> 37:57.125
Really?

37:57.208 --> 38:00.416
Yep. I wonder what
Zolthard is up to.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.416
Well, until Norman's
back online,

38:02.458 --> 38:03.958
there's nothing we can do.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.916
Haa!

38:12.166 --> 38:14.500
And?

38:14.541 --> 38:17.166
Sorry, Boss. They got a--

38:20.750 --> 38:23.041
- They got away.
- Again!

38:23.333 --> 38:24.500
It's your fault.

38:24.541 --> 38:26.500
My fault? Is not!

38:26.791 --> 38:28.916
Stop that!

38:30.125 --> 38:32.875
We need to get the Droid army
down here yesterday!

38:33.208 --> 38:34.541
How are we
going to do that, Boss?

38:34.583 --> 38:37.458
We need to send them a signal!

38:37.916 --> 38:39.833
Those pesky peace keepers

38:39.875 --> 38:42.666
are stuck inside that
Norman creature.

38:42.916 --> 38:45.000
They have the coordinates
of that wormhole.

38:45.125 --> 38:45.875
Wormhole?

38:46.208 --> 38:49.666
We need to get rid of these,
what do you call them again?

38:49.875 --> 38:51.500
-Kids.
-Kids! Good.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.458
Hello, kids.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.250
This is your leader speaking.

38:59.500 --> 39:03.125
School's out early!
It's home time.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.208
Something weird is going on.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.000
You're right, Frankie.
It's time for a live-stream.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.291
This is your host, Alejandro.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.208
As you can see,

39:13.250 --> 39:16.125
trapped in the middle
of this unscheduled evacuation.

39:16.583 --> 39:19.166
We are surrounded,
and we don't know where to go.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.000
And who knows
how long we have?

39:21.166 --> 39:22.791
Are you serious right now?

39:23.458 --> 39:26.166
What we need to do
is find Charlene and Norman.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.666
Look at the chaos!

39:27.916 --> 39:28.875
I am risking my life

39:28.916 --> 39:31.250
to bring you these updates,
minute by minute.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.458
It looks like the
main stampede is over,

39:37.958 --> 39:40.500
but the strangest thing of all,

39:40.541 --> 39:42.250
it appears like the
teachers themselves

39:42.291 --> 39:44.875
are breaking down the school.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.250
Alejandro. Out.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.500
Where are you guys?

39:54.541 --> 39:56.708
You won't believe the drama
we just witnessed.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.250
It's crazy,
it's like the end of the world.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.666
Charlene? Listen,

39:59.708 --> 40:01.208
you're not going to believe
what's happened.

40:01.250 --> 40:04.666
There is no way your day
was stranger than mine.

40:04.791 --> 40:07.250
Meet us at Virgil's
as soon as you can.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.000
So, what do you think?

40:13.583 --> 40:16.416
I believe you,
I guess.

40:17.541 --> 40:20.458
Okay, Virgil will know
what to do.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.583
Yeah.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.708
Let's see what he has to say.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.583
Hello?

40:40.333 --> 40:42.083
Hey, who's there?

40:42.125 --> 40:43.000
Oh, hi, Virgil--

40:43.041 --> 40:44.625
Norman, over here.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.291
Listen, I got to talk to you.
Something big is--

40:46.333 --> 40:48.291
Norman, who is that with you?

40:48.333 --> 40:50.000
It's me, Virgil.

40:50.041 --> 40:50.916
Oh!

40:51.291 --> 40:52.666
Did anyone see you guys
come in here?

40:52.708 --> 40:53.208
No!

40:53.416 --> 40:55.166
You know,
you can't be too careful.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.833
They're everywhere.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.000
Enough with the
conspiracy theories, Virgil.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.541
So, what brings
you guys in here?

41:01.666 --> 41:02.916
Mind control.

41:04.250 --> 41:06.625
Hey, did you just say mind--

41:06.666 --> 41:08.416
-Control, yeah.
-Yeah.

41:08.458 --> 41:11.583
Oh. All right, follow me.

41:12.041 --> 41:12.708
Come on.

41:13.958 --> 41:17.083
All right. This guy looks like
he might actually

41:17.125 --> 41:18.416
know what's going on here.

41:18.458 --> 41:21.291
So, spill it man.

41:21.583 --> 41:25.000
Right, so the school,
well Principal Witherington--

41:25.041 --> 41:27.166
Wait, is that old battle axe
still there?

41:27.250 --> 41:27.791
Yeah.

41:27.875 --> 41:30.000
Man, she taught me English
in the third grade.

41:30.041 --> 41:33.750
She must be like, what,
a million years old?

41:33.916 --> 41:36.583
Maybe she's a lizard from Mars.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.625
There's truth to those stories,
you know.

41:38.708 --> 41:41.541
Well, funny you should say that,
because an intergalactic villain

41:41.583 --> 41:43.916
has taking control of
Principal Witherington.

41:43.958 --> 41:46.333
Lizards have been-- hold up.
Did you just say intergalactic?

41:46.625 --> 41:48.125
He's not kidding.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.666
Aliens?

41:51.083 --> 41:51.666
Yeah.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.000
Intergalactic?

41:53.166 --> 41:53.916
Ah-ha.

41:54.541 --> 41:55.833
Control?

41:56.958 --> 41:57.625
Yeah.

41:57.666 --> 42:01.125
Mind blown. It's true!

42:01.291 --> 42:02.416
At last!

42:02.458 --> 42:04.583
I was starting to think Norman
was all we had.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.208
- Yeah.
- I knew he’d believe us.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.000
I told you we should come here.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.041
Shhh!

42:09.583 --> 42:12.583
Your phones.
Quick, in the box, now!

42:12.625 --> 42:13.541
No way, Jose...

42:13.583 --> 42:14.708
Come on Charlene, just do it.

42:14.791 --> 42:15.583
Come on!

42:15.625 --> 42:16.416
Okay.

42:18.250 --> 42:20.083
Here, put these on.

42:21.416 --> 42:21.833
Really?

42:22.125 --> 42:23.833
Trust me,
he knows what he's doing.

42:24.958 --> 42:27.083
So now that that's
out of the way,

42:27.166 --> 42:29.958
have any of you heard of
Quantum Physics?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.416
Oh, Quantum Physics?
Sure.

42:31.833 --> 42:34.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah, quantum.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.458
So according to
Quantum Physics--

42:38.500 --> 42:40.708
It's possible for
subatomic particles

42:40.791 --> 42:43.166
to travel faster than
the speed of light. Old news.

42:43.208 --> 42:44.333
Exactly!

42:44.500 --> 42:45.791
Yeah. Huh?

42:45.833 --> 42:46.541
Yeah!

42:46.833 --> 42:50.291
Also, it’s verified in
Fire Bane, Edition 2,

42:50.750 --> 42:52.541
where the bad guys
shrink themselves down

42:52.583 --> 42:55.166
right at the end to rip off
Fort Knox.

42:55.666 --> 42:56.583
So it is possible.

42:56.625 --> 42:58.375
This guy is a nut job.

42:58.416 --> 43:00.291
This is one of my favourites.

43:00.791 --> 43:01.500
Okay.

43:01.541 --> 43:03.250
Maybe, possibly that the
government's involved.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.541
Wait, quick, hide!
FBI!

43:07.708 --> 43:10.958
Oh! I hate the smell
of this place.

43:11.791 --> 43:15.375
Maybe Virgil forgot to shower.
Again.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.541
It's just Frankie and Alejandro!
Relax.

43:17.791 --> 43:20.208
Hey, nice hats everybody!

43:21.333 --> 43:22.458
Why you don't answer my texts?

43:22.500 --> 43:23.458
I'll take that.

43:23.541 --> 43:26.916
Oh no, Virgil, you are not
getting my phone. Virgil!

43:26.958 --> 43:29.041
Uh, come on guys,
you know the drill.

43:29.458 --> 43:31.541
Principle Witherington
went kind of loco.

43:31.583 --> 43:33.208
She made this
crazy announcement.

43:33.291 --> 43:34.916
Sent everybody home,
even the teachers.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.083
- Mm?
- What?

43:36.250 --> 43:40.208
Yep! There's definitely
something weird going on.

43:40.458 --> 43:41.625
Show them.

43:41.750 --> 43:44.625
This must be my best work yet.

43:44.708 --> 43:47.125
I was considering the stage,
but the journalist in me--

43:47.166 --> 43:49.250
-Alejandro! Focus.
-Okay, okay.

43:49.291 --> 43:50.000
Look at that.

43:50.083 --> 43:51.458
I thought it was
the end of the world.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.000
It's pandemonium.

43:53.041 --> 43:56.750
Anderson and Hernandez seem
to be gathering scrap metal, and

43:56.791 --> 43:59.041
behaving like psycho zombies.

43:59.375 --> 44:00.916
Okay.

44:01.083 --> 44:03.208
I wonder if they lost
contact with their fleet,

44:03.250 --> 44:05.000
when we came
through that wormhole?

44:05.291 --> 44:07.416
Wait, you guys came
through a wormhole?

44:07.791 --> 44:10.041
Agh, that's so awesome!

44:10.166 --> 44:13.333
Norman, is there anything
you want to tell us?

44:13.541 --> 44:14.833
Oh yeah!

44:14.958 --> 44:17.791
You guys are going to be
blown away.

44:18.333 --> 44:20.375
I think you better tell
everyone what's going on.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.750
I told you there was
something going on.

44:23.041 --> 44:24.125
The whole story?

44:24.208 --> 44:25.958
Everything. And don't
forget the part

44:26.000 --> 44:27.250
about the Aliens in your brain.

44:27.375 --> 44:29.041
It's all in here, man!

44:29.166 --> 44:31.166
Virgil, not helping.

44:31.375 --> 44:32.083
Norman?

44:32.458 --> 44:34.958
Okay, so if I know Zolthard,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.500
he's going to try to
figure out a way

44:36.541 --> 44:37.708
to make contact
with the fleet.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.875
We need to figure out a way
to stop him.

44:40.541 --> 44:43.666
Well, that's not going
to happen here, is it?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.791
Norman, we need you to go--

44:46.833 --> 44:49.625
Back to the school and find
out what Zolthard is up to.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.791
They think he'll bring his
fleet here, and invade Earth.

44:52.875 --> 44:54.375
Let me get this straight.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.458
You want us to go
back to the school,

44:56.500 --> 44:58.333
where the psycho zombies are,

44:58.500 --> 45:00.541
where we'll be picked off
one by one,

45:00.583 --> 45:02.416
and there will be
a big final battle,

45:02.458 --> 45:05.625
and only one of us will survive.
Probably you.

45:05.750 --> 45:06.750
Yeah.

45:06.916 --> 45:09.041
Uh, guys look,

45:09.125 --> 45:10.750
I know I've been like the
worst friend ever

45:10.791 --> 45:12.875
and I got you guys in
tons of trouble.

45:12.958 --> 45:14.500
And like, you've always
been there for me

45:14.541 --> 45:16.375
in any of my crazy ideas.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.916
But this is my mission.

45:20.208 --> 45:21.750
You guys should stay here.

45:22.333 --> 45:25.250
And besides, I'm the one
with the aliens in my head.

45:25.291 --> 45:27.750
I'm the one who needs to
join forces with them,

45:27.791 --> 45:30.875
and take on Zolthard,
and save the entire planet.

45:30.916 --> 45:33.791
Sure, I may need help,
but I'll find it out there.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.875
Wherever the fight for
freedom and justice is,

45:35.916 --> 45:37.083
that's where I'll be.

45:37.166 --> 45:38.458
Should we put him
out of his misery?

45:38.583 --> 45:39.458
A bit pathetic.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.250
-Charlene?
-Let's do it.

45:40.291 --> 45:41.333
Zolthard thinks he can hide.

45:41.500 --> 45:42.708
He can't hide from us.

45:42.750 --> 45:44.625
-We're the main-- huh?
-Norman!

45:44.791 --> 45:46.291
You're taking this a
little too seriously.

45:46.333 --> 45:47.125
But I--

45:47.166 --> 45:49.875
Oh, don't be a lunatic, Norman.
We're all coming with you.

45:50.041 --> 45:51.625
Yeah, who knows,
might be interesting.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.333
Yeah! Crazy teachers.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.541
Psycho zombies.
Take over the entire planet.

45:55.666 --> 45:57.333
Somebody's got to put this
on camera.

45:57.375 --> 45:58.791
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.708
Uhhh,

46:03.250 --> 46:06.291
I'm going to need
those hats back.

46:21.250 --> 46:23.041
Come on! This way.

46:27.875 --> 46:29.416
Boss is going
to like this door.

46:29.541 --> 46:31.958
He's going to love it. Yeah.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.500
There, there we go.

46:39.416 --> 46:42.791
Whoa, what on earth are they
doing to the school?

46:42.875 --> 46:43.541
What's going on?

46:43.583 --> 46:46.000
This is destruction
on a whole new level.

46:46.208 --> 46:47.708
#NoSchoolTomorrow

46:47.750 --> 46:49.791
They're obviously
building something.

46:49.833 --> 46:52.000
They are turning the school
into a chop shop.

46:52.041 --> 46:55.583
Last time I checked, Zolthard
wasn't into trash collection.

46:55.625 --> 46:59.291
Yeah, I gave him a whole bunch
and he didn't like it one bit.

46:59.416 --> 47:01.458
This is going to be interesting.

47:01.833 --> 47:02.833
We have to get inside.

47:03.125 --> 47:04.458
Let's go.

47:05.791 --> 47:08.708
No, wait.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.833
Hurry up!

47:16.791 --> 47:18.833
Yoh, he's going
to love it.

47:25.125 --> 47:27.500
Stay frosty, kids.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.208
Where do we go?

47:33.750 --> 47:34.750
I think it's this way.

47:35.000 --> 47:35.666
You ready?

47:35.708 --> 47:36.875
Wait!

47:38.083 --> 47:39.375
Alejandro! What are you doing?

47:39.416 --> 47:41.000
- Come on, this way.
- But--

47:41.083 --> 47:42.625
Let's go, let's go.

47:58.416 --> 48:01.000
OMG! Guys!

48:01.041 --> 48:02.333
-What is it?
-Wait, wait!

48:02.750 --> 48:05.666
That picture that I just took
of us? Got another 20 likes.

48:05.708 --> 48:07.625
- Ugh, really?
- Come on.

48:20.916 --> 48:22.750
Anyone else hear that.

48:25.083 --> 48:31.750
Let’s keep going, guys,
come on. Come on!

48:35.166 --> 48:39.250
- Anything?
- No. Nothing.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.166
Where'd they go?

48:41.375 --> 48:42.250
I don't know.

48:42.375 --> 48:43.875
This is not good.

48:45.500 --> 48:46.458
Did you guys hear that?

48:46.500 --> 48:48.708
Norman! I am picking up
heat signatures

48:48.750 --> 48:49.791
from behind those doors.

48:50.208 --> 48:52.000
Guys, it's probably
nothing.

48:52.041 --> 48:53.250
-Be careful!
-Alejandro, wait.

48:53.291 --> 48:55.333
Anderson and Hernandez
are probably--

48:58.875 --> 48:59.916
Right behind this door.

48:59.958 --> 49:01.416
RUN!!

49:04.583 --> 49:05.375
They're going the
wrong way.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.625
Come on!

49:07.708 --> 49:09.125
Come on.

49:09.375 --> 49:11.208
Quick in here.

49:18.875 --> 49:20.166
I think he’s gone.

49:20.208 --> 49:22.083
I wonder how Norman and Frankie
are doing.

49:22.166 --> 49:24.500
Charlene, you can just look
for yourself.

49:24.625 --> 49:25.625
Cool.

49:25.708 --> 49:28.708
So many cameras, so little time.

49:29.083 --> 49:31.208
Look Camera 3-
Norman and Frankie.

49:31.750 --> 49:33.458
They’re heading past
the Science class.

49:33.500 --> 49:35.291
Great. From here we can see if
there are any--

49:35.333 --> 49:36.958
Teachers, Hernandez!
On Camera 5,

49:37.000 --> 49:37.666
he is headed
straight towards them.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.333
No, no, no, no!

49:39.916 --> 49:43.375
He should be coming out of
Camera 2 in, three, two, one,

49:43.750 --> 49:44.750
Go Two!

49:46.666 --> 49:48.166
Hey, where are you guys?

49:48.291 --> 49:50.833
Hernandez, coming round the
corner in front of you. Hide!

49:50.875 --> 49:52.791
Hide, hide, hide hide.

49:59.041 --> 50:01.375
Be quiet,
he is right there.

50:05.041 --> 50:07.291
There you are.
What are you up to?

50:07.416 --> 50:08.291
Kids.

50:08.333 --> 50:10.583
Get back to work.

50:10.916 --> 50:12.166
Hmm.

50:13.666 --> 50:16.416
Don’t move,
Witherington’s still there.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.583
Okay, she is going!

50:23.916 --> 50:25.750
Thanks. Are you guys ok?

50:26.041 --> 50:26.916
We're fine.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.708
Wait, how do you know
where we are?

50:28.750 --> 50:30.083
We’re in
the security room.

50:30.125 --> 50:32.041
We’re watching you on
the CCTV cameras.

50:32.166 --> 50:33.625
Oh, hey, guys.

50:33.666 --> 50:34.791
Hey, Norman.

50:35.041 --> 50:36.958
Remember, these are
high angle cameras,

50:37.000 --> 50:38.250
so play to your right profile.

50:38.375 --> 50:39.458
It's much stronger.

50:39.583 --> 50:42.458
Guys, stop fooling around.
Ok, the way is clear.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.125
Anderson!

50:44.166 --> 50:45.500
Run, run, run.

50:46.291 --> 50:48.958
Norman! In here! Come on!

50:49.041 --> 50:50.625
Ok, coming.

51:03.250 --> 51:06.583
Haah!

51:06.833 --> 51:10.458
Guys, he's in the classroom.

51:33.375 --> 51:35.625
He's coming your way,
Norman.

51:35.666 --> 51:36.625
Norman, move!

51:36.666 --> 51:38.916
Norman,
get out there. Go!

51:39.708 --> 51:42.000
You've gotta move now.

52:00.041 --> 52:02.416
Report to me,
immediately.

52:02.500 --> 52:04.750
We've got work to do.

52:08.583 --> 52:09.833
Let’s follow them.

52:10.041 --> 52:12.875
What? Frankie! Oh, man!

52:13.500 --> 52:15.500
This is crazy. They don’t know
what they are heading in to.

52:15.750 --> 52:17.291
Well, let's try to help them.

52:17.416 --> 52:20.125
Ok, if they are going away
from the Science classroom,

52:20.166 --> 52:23.375
then that means they are
probably going towards the...

52:24.125 --> 52:27.625
Charlene... you’re going to want
to see this.

52:44.125 --> 52:48.166
Hey, Norman, you are not going
to believe this,

52:48.208 --> 52:53.250
but inside of the gym there
is a giant doomsday device.

52:53.916 --> 52:55.875
Where were you?

52:56.375 --> 52:59.375
Kids.

53:02.208 --> 53:04.750
Zolthard is gonna destroy the
entire planet.

53:05.041 --> 53:06.791
Looks like some
kind of transmitter.

53:06.916 --> 53:09.208
Oh, or maybe that.

53:09.250 --> 53:12.125
That's one humongous
pile of junk.

53:12.375 --> 53:13.791
Gus, let's take a closer look.

53:13.833 --> 53:16.833
Norman, listen to me
very carefully.

53:16.958 --> 53:19.083
Zolthard is going to
use that transmitter

53:19.125 --> 53:20.708
to contact his fleet.

53:20.833 --> 53:23.625
If the signal gets through,
billions of Control Droids

53:23.666 --> 53:26.625
will invade Earth and take over
every human being on the planet.

53:26.666 --> 53:29.416
And then, Frankie,
it's all over.

53:29.833 --> 53:31.916
And the last thing--
What was that?

53:32.708 --> 53:34.000
Hmm?

53:34.958 --> 53:36.208
How do we stop them?

53:36.291 --> 53:39.375
Can't you hack into their system
and upload a virus?

53:39.458 --> 53:42.208
Hmm, okay, I can give it a shot.

53:43.125 --> 53:45.583
Now, as punishment,
you can move that table

53:45.625 --> 53:47.583
from there to there and move
that from there to there.

53:47.625 --> 53:49.208
Now move it!

53:50.333 --> 53:53.166
Norman, your friend could be
onto something.

53:53.875 --> 53:56.083
I need to use the
Digital Interface.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.833
Norman, you didn't seriously
just grab that for me?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.041
Oh, sorry, Frankie.
It's not me. It's Gus.

54:06.083 --> 54:07.250
He says he thinks
he has a way to

54:07.291 --> 54:08.666
hack into Zolthard’s systems,
and--

54:08.708 --> 54:11.875
upload a virus and disable
Zolthard’s entire fleet.

54:12.250 --> 54:14.083
That's pretty cool.

54:14.291 --> 54:16.416
But if we do this...

54:16.541 --> 54:19.666
Oh, then we could upload it
with the signal as a virus.

54:19.833 --> 54:21.125
Yeah, but--

54:21.166 --> 54:24.458
Yeah, that's right.
Good job.

54:24.500 --> 54:25.875
Gus says good job.

54:25.958 --> 54:28.125
Yeah, but we still have to
compile it,

54:28.166 --> 54:30.291
plug it into the system
and debug it.

54:31.416 --> 54:32.750
Charlene!
Gus and Frankie have

54:32.791 --> 54:34.416
created a virus
to stop Zolthard.

54:34.458 --> 54:35.833
- Norman!
- All we have to do

54:35.875 --> 54:37.791
is upload it via the
communications device--

54:37.833 --> 54:39.666
Norman!!!
You have company!

54:39.791 --> 54:41.083
Wow.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.541
Move! Now!

54:42.583 --> 54:44.500
Norman,
this is pretty good,

54:44.541 --> 54:47.041
I mean, this coding is...

54:47.666 --> 54:49.666
Fun-tastic.

54:49.791 --> 54:51.250
Get out of here, Frankie!

54:51.291 --> 54:53.375
Don't worry about
a thing, Norman. We've got--

54:53.416 --> 54:56.041
Alright. It’s time for the
grown-ups to do their thing.

54:56.458 --> 54:58.000
- Max, maybe just--
- There is not enough--

54:58.041 --> 54:59.666
Hey, hey, kids!

55:00.125 --> 55:00.583
Guys?

55:00.625 --> 55:02.291
He doesn't have the power.

55:02.625 --> 55:04.583
I know how to handle myself.

55:08.125 --> 55:09.958
Time to take it to the Max.

55:10.416 --> 55:14.000
So, you think I’m just
some weak kid, do ya?

55:15.416 --> 55:17.250
You’re facing one
of the oldest

55:17.375 --> 55:20.208
and most feared
veteran law enforcers

55:20.250 --> 55:23.250
in the galaxy.

55:24.166 --> 55:25.666
Whoa! What just happened?

55:25.708 --> 55:29.166
Well, that’s a plot twist
I wasn’t expecting.

55:29.625 --> 55:32.875
Yip, definitely something wrong
with these controls.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.083
- What?
- Unbelievable!

55:35.208 --> 55:36.333
There's something
wrong with you.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.500
Now move over
and let me do this.

55:38.625 --> 55:41.333
Sophie, it's no use.
Norman's gone off-line!

55:41.583 --> 55:43.416
I wonder what's going on
out there.

55:43.625 --> 55:46.416
And so we enter
the dark night of the soul.

55:52.208 --> 55:53.458
Oh, no.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.708
Norman is coming back
online... and there.

55:58.958 --> 56:00.875
Max! You came back.

56:00.958 --> 56:01.958
Not good.

56:02.458 --> 56:05.375
You thought that maybe
you could stop me?

56:05.416 --> 56:09.333
You third rate,
peace keeping do-gooder.

56:09.666 --> 56:12.041
I'll show you third rate.
Get out of my way.

56:12.833 --> 56:15.750
Now listen here you two bit
excuse of a scum--

56:15.791 --> 56:20.208
No! It is you my dear Max,
you should listen to me.

56:20.250 --> 56:24.416
Here it comes, kids.
The big bad guy speech.

56:24.458 --> 56:26.375
Now all we have to do
is sit back,

56:26.541 --> 56:28.458
and listen to his whole
evil plan.

56:29.041 --> 56:30.166
Simple.

56:32.166 --> 56:34.291
Oh. Microphone's on
isn’t it?

56:36.791 --> 56:38.958
Hmm, you may have a point.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.041
It suddenly seems silly to
just lay out my plans like that.

56:43.083 --> 56:44.958
Better I think...

56:45.000 --> 56:46.875
-to make you part of them.
-What?

56:46.916 --> 56:48.375
No, no, no. What are you doing?

56:48.416 --> 56:49.583
No. No, no, no, no.

56:49.625 --> 56:50.708
You don't have to do this.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.500
-Engaging defence systems.
-On it.

56:52.541 --> 56:55.625
We are coming for you, Max.

56:55.666 --> 56:56.916
No, no!

56:56.958 --> 56:59.333
Nooo!

56:59.708 --> 57:03.125
His improvisation is incredible!

57:03.333 --> 57:06.375
Droids... Get me the
coordinates for that wormhole.

57:06.750 --> 57:09.000
Yes, Master Zolthard, Sir.

57:09.083 --> 57:12.000
It's only a matter of time now.

57:13.250 --> 57:15.750
Charlene, look, it's Hernandez.

57:15.791 --> 57:18.791
And he’s right outside the door.

57:24.833 --> 57:25.916
Do you think he's gone?

57:26.041 --> 57:27.875
Let's take a quick peek.

57:29.250 --> 57:31.208
Charlene, look!

57:32.250 --> 57:35.625
-Yeah!
-Oh, oh.

57:45.708 --> 57:48.000
Charlene, this door is
on it’s last legs. Is it time?

57:48.041 --> 57:49.625
Not yet.

57:49.666 --> 57:50.791
And now? Is it time yet now?

57:50.833 --> 57:52.166
Not yet!

57:52.375 --> 57:54.416
Charlene, listen,
I really think--

57:54.458 --> 57:55.000
Now!

57:55.041 --> 57:56.041
Oh, oh.

57:56.083 --> 57:58.583
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

58:21.750 --> 58:24.583
Guys, we've got company.

58:25.791 --> 58:27.250
Oh, no.

58:27.583 --> 58:28.666
Bring them on!

58:29.083 --> 58:30.791
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

58:30.833 --> 58:32.666
I told you it's useless
without the power pack.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
Ah, Max, talk about being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

58:41.333 --> 58:42.791
Yeah. Story of my life.

58:42.875 --> 58:44.666
Look, credit where it's due.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.833
You did put up a good chase.

58:48.208 --> 58:51.208
But that is all over now.

58:51.541 --> 58:53.208
-Aah!
-Ooh!

58:53.875 --> 58:56.458
Better run while you still can.

58:56.500 --> 58:59.125
Run? In my fifty years
on the job,

58:59.166 --> 59:00.750
I've never run from a fight.

59:01.500 --> 59:02.916
Don't worry, kids.

59:03.083 --> 59:04.458
This ship's hull is made from

59:04.500 --> 59:06.833
interlaced fibers
of nano-ionic alloy.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.208
Nothing can get through that.

59:08.541 --> 59:10.625
Engage the Quantum Welder!

59:11.208 --> 59:12.125
The what now?

59:22.583 --> 59:24.708
This feels a lot like
running away, Max.

59:27.291 --> 59:30.166
Why are you standing around
doing nothing?

59:30.333 --> 59:32.375
Take care of Max and his crew.

59:32.458 --> 59:33.500
Yes, Zolthard, Sir.

59:33.958 --> 59:36.666
This isn't running.
This is a tactical withdrawal.

59:36.708 --> 59:39.208
More like a tactical wussing out
if you ask me!

59:39.250 --> 59:40.375
-Guys!
-I didn't

59:40.416 --> 59:41.291
Brave Max,

59:41.333 --> 59:42.666
-heroically leading the charge
-I'm trying to keep you from

59:42.708 --> 59:43.708
-in the other direction.
-becoming a robots breakfast!

59:43.750 --> 59:45.125
Guys!

59:45.416 --> 59:47.541
Who's driving Norman?

59:48.083 --> 59:49.666
-No, no.
-What's going on there?

59:49.708 --> 59:51.666
Quiet, earth worm!

59:52.125 --> 59:54.666
I am trying to work.

59:55.875 --> 59:57.958
Quick, in here.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.916
Do you think he's gone?

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:08.250
I think so.

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.083
Great!
Now we're trapped backstage.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.125
What better place
could there be?

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.375
Seriously, Alejandro?

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah, now we can arm ourselves.

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:24.291
All of this stuff
is completely fake.

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:27.458
This suit of armor,
these spears, they're not real.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:28.750
And look at this thing.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.250
Ow.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.250
Get behind me, Charlene!

01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:32.625
Back, donkey, back!

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.708
Get away from me.

01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:38.750
That sounds like
somebody I know.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.916
Is that...?

01:00:41.958 --> 01:00:45.000
Uh, well, if it isn't
crazy-man Mike.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:45.916
Please don't hurt me!

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.375
We are not going to hurt you.

01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.958
Yeah, stop blubbering
and pull yourself together.

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.208
You mean you're not one of them?

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.833
No!

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.000
God, great!

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.708
Thank goodness-- you've gotta
get me out of here!!

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.250
They gonna take over my mind.

01:00:58.541 --> 01:00:59.500
They're gonna...

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.791
Snap out of it, big guy.

01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.541
Its not like you have a brain
for them to eat anyway.

01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:04.791
Now take a deep breath.

01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:06.333
But how are we
going to save Norman?

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.000
There is a way.

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:11.458
Friends, together we will
stage the greatest

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.208
theatrical diversion ever seen
in human times.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.458
-Huh?
-Umm?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.708
This is the big time.

01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.791
We must be sharp,
like the blade.

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.041
Explosive, like the grenade.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.750
We must move with style
and with sass.

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:27.041
And we must be strong.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.083
Like the ass--

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.250
Alejandro!

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.791
What?

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.625
Whoa!

01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:44.125
Ok, Sophie, let’s do this.

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:47.250
Time to shut this baby down.

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.416
I've got this.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.166
No problem.

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.416
-Sophie!
-Sophie!!

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.416
Alright, step back kids.
Time to bring out the big guns.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:08.250
Uuuuh!

01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:12.500
Harder than it looks.

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:13.958
Aaaah!

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.916
A little help here, Gus?

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.250
Oh, yeah right.

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:20.000
I've got the Control Droid's
manual right here...

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.000
somewhere.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:24.375
Welcome and...

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
...the new D17.5 Control Droid.

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.666
We hope that your purchase
of our product--

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:31.708
-Gus?
-Gus!

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.000
Okay, okay.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.708
Schematics, schematics--

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.375
Whoa. Sorry.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.541
I think I broke my butt-bone.

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:41.666
Yah!

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:49.291
Gus, any help you have will be
greatly appreciated...

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:52.500
Wow. They’re even outfitted with
telescopic forearms.

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:55.458
You don't say.

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:59.375
Access to the control panel
is on the back of the head!

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.750
Over here, you big softy.
Hehe.

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:03.625
-Got it.
-Any time now, kids.

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.583
Put the blue wire in the green
socket to power down.

01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:07.750
-Okay
-Uuuh!

01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.875
Not exactly what we're
looking for, but I'll take it.

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.625
Okay. Try green into purple.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:13.416
Fine.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:20.375
Don’t. Think. It’s that. One.

01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:22.166
I don’t know... grey into blue?

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.250
You sure?

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:25.958
Uh! Hey, I didn’t know
I could still do that.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.333
I definitely can’t do that!

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:29.583
Oh, for Pete's sake.

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:31.333
Yaah!

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.750
Max, you okay?

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:39.041
Yeah.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:41.041
Wow, that was rough.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.583
Oh? Had a tough time, did you?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.583
I don't think we can
do that again.

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:49.291
We might not have to.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.666
Guys, this power pack
is still fully charged.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.291
Really, why did I agree to this?

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:27.791
Ooh.

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.750
Now, Control Droid!

01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:32.458
Initiating
Mind Manipulation Protocol.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:37.458
Uh, uh.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.625
There you are, Max.

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:43.791
Your host is now mine.

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:48.083
Oh, but don’t worry,
I will take good care of it.

01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.875
You!! Get up there.

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:08.250
I did not sign up
for this.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.125
Not so fast.

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:28.333
Uhm!

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.208
Ooh! Aah!

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.791
Awe. Some.

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.750
Good shot, Soph.

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:41.208
Hey, look, a souvenir.

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.250
Max, we've got problems.

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.833
What are we going to do
about those?

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.916
Now, get me the coordinates for
that wormhole!

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:50.083
Yes,
Master Zolthard.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.500
- Five.
- What in the?!

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:53.291
-Six.
-Six.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.208
-Four.
-Four.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:58.250
-Three.
-Three.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.708
Two.

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.166
-Seven.
-Uh-uh.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:02.375
Two.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.541
-Two.
-Five.

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:08.500
Oh, this is such a
momentous occasion.

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:13.083
I mean, it's not
every day that one successfully

01:06:13.125 --> 01:06:15.416
subjugates an entire planet!

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.541
How do I get this thing
to shut up?

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:17.916
Dash.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:18.833
Five.

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:19.500
Shut up!

01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.291
- Five. Dash.
- Oh yeah? You want some more?

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:25.208
Three. Six.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.500
- Seven. Eight.
- Aah!

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:30.416
Four.

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:34.041
Dash. Five.
Dash. Two.

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:35.833
Heads up!

01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:38.708
Five. Three.

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.916
Two.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.625
What's going on in there?

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:55.958
Oh, man, what happened.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.333
Frankie?

01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:58.500
What?

01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:03.333
She's trying to interfere
with my communications device.

01:07:07.666 --> 01:07:09.625
Are the coordinates complete?

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.208
Yes, Sir.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.500
Then get on with it.

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:15.916
With pleasure, Sir.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.541
Guys, a little help.

01:07:26.583 --> 01:07:28.125
Frankie!

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.166
Frankie! Nooo!

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:49.083
Isn't that
magnificent?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.541
Wow, Boss, that looks great.
We did it.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.666
Well, you fools
took long enough.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.916
Let's get the
Droid armies down here.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:09.208
Oh, no.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.208
Creatures from a distant galaxy.

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:15.458
You have made the grave error
of invading Earth

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:19.791
and inciting the wrath of its
Cosmic Protector.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.833
Huh!

01:08:20.916 --> 01:08:21.875
Huh, ow!

01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:24.000
Uh!

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:25.125
Stop bumping me
like that.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.791
Your butt is in my face.

01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:27.916
You don't
have a face.

01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:29.916
Be the
donkey's butt!

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:30.916
Guys!

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:32.416
-Ow.
-Ow!

01:08:32.458 --> 01:08:33.916
Charge!

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:39.000
Charge!!

01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.125
Umf!!

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:42.791
Try to stay in character.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.666
No!

01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:45.875
No! What?

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.083
What's going on?

01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:54.625
Stop! Get it off me!

01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.583
What happened?

01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:58.291
What's going on?

01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:00.916
Where am I?

01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.125
Let's go, come on.

01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:13.208
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.125
Huh?

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.791
You're mine now.

01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.041
Heeey!

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:28.291
Can anybody hear me?
Oh, there we go.

01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:30.250
Oh, no, not again!

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.166
Frankie, is that you?

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:43.416
Who else, Norman?

01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.125
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:48.250
I've uploaded the hack.
It just needs to be activated.

01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.166
But I can't go back up there.

01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:52.541
I can get you up there, Norman.

01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:55.250
Follow me.
Sophie says she can help us out.

01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:59.166
Oh, no, that's just perfect.

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.375
How do we stop this?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500
Sophie, you there?

01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:06.541
Let's do this.

01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:09.083
Oh, no!

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:11.666
No, no, no, no, no.
Gus, do something.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.250
-Okay, I can--
-There's no time.

01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:15.208
Wait, what do you mean
there's no time?

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:30.291
Norman, the signal has reached
the Mothership.

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:31.833
We need the hack, now.

01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:32.791
What?

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:33.708
Who's he talking to?

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.458
The voices in his head.

01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:36.500
We're doomed.

01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:39.208
Norman,
the Intergalactic Peaceforce

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.708
has entrusted us
with stopping Zolthard.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.958
The fate of the entire universe
hangs in the balance.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.208
If Zolthard’s army
reaches Earth,

01:10:47.416 --> 01:10:51.375
nothing will stop him from mind
controlling everyone!

01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:52.833
But I'm just a kid.

01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:54.291
You're not just a kid.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.458
You're our last and only hope.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.166
-Norman, what's going on?
-Huh?

01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:00.458
Guys, we're on our own.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.291
So you are not the one!

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:07.375
Um, we gotta do something.
Guys?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.958
Ah, man,
not these two again!

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:16.250
You can do this.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:18.625
All you have to do
is push the button.

01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:20.500
We believe in you, Norman.

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:33.708
Here goes all, or nothing.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.000
Hello, can anybody
hear me?

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:40.625
Help me out!

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:45.791
I was only joking earlier.
You are totally the one.

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.416
I can't breathe! Oh!

01:11:58.041 --> 01:12:02.458
Let the invasion begin!

01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:16.416
What's he doing up there?

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.041
Stop him!

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:37.333
Yeah! Nice shot.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.750
Come here, you,
got you now.

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:09.500
Aah!

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.125
Yeah, yeah. Go, Norman!

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.250
-He did it!
-Yeah, Norman!

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.625
That's my boy.

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:41.750
What have you done?

01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:44.791
Canceled your invasion plans.
Hope you don't mind.

01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:47.250
Come here I'll tear you apart.

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:49.541
You vile creature!

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:52.583
You've ruined everything!

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:54.125
Norman! Watch out!

01:14:02.083 --> 01:14:03.708
-Charlene! Come on.
-We've gotta go.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.125
Get out the way.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:09.416
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ow!

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.958
Come here.

01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:26.500
You ruined everything!

01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:28.500
Yeah, we sure did.

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.416
Droids, get them!

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.208
I'm afraid the Droids
are currently offline.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.208
What?

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:35.875
It’s over, Zolthard.

01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:37.833
It’s not over.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.000
Who’s going to stop me?

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:41.750
We are.

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:43.625
You wouldn't dare.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:46.083
Oh, no? Hm.

01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:48.500
I think we've got this.

01:14:58.791 --> 01:15:00.625
And you kids
are all okay, huh?

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.958
Yes, officer,
we're all accounted for.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:05.500
And you say
you didn't see who did it?

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:08.083
No, Officer.
But Ms. Witherington

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:09.875
has been under a lot
of stress lately.

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.291
School's been crazy.

01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:14.375
Yeah. Kids, huh?

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.791
Yeah, we're the worst.

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:19.833
So you've told me
absolutely everything you saw?

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.041
Yes, Sir.

01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.125
Well, good job, son.

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:25.333
Thank you, Officer.

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.875
You're a credit to Hubble Bay.

01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:28.291
Oh, thank you, Officer.

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:30.250
All right, run along now.

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:31.500
Yes, Officer.

01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:35.000
Are we off the hook?

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:35.375
Yeah.

01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:36.875
Alright!

01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:40.833
Finally! This is the big time.
Fame, fortune.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:43.583
I can have my own show.
I can see it now.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:46.083
"Principal Witherington
taken over by Aliens".

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.125
Whoa there! Humanity's not quite
ready to know about us yet.

01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:52.250
Yeah,
I'd be careful who you tell.

01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.583
Civilizations get kind of antsy

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:57.208
when it comes to
invading space alien species.

01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:59.333
I don't really
feel like being dissected

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:01.083
by government scientists.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.958
So, Principal Witherington,
tell us--

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.958
Ah, that's not going to happen.

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:09.458
We're all going to have to
keep this a secret.

01:16:09.625 --> 01:16:11.500
Hmm. That's a pity.

01:16:11.791 --> 01:16:13.291
Or, maybe even better...

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:17.666
The selfless and the brave hero
never truly acknowledged

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:21.208
for the sacrifices he made
to save the world.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:24.208
We know what you did, Norman.
Good job.

01:16:24.833 --> 01:16:27.416
Thanks, guys. It wasn't
anything, really, I just--

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.916
I mean it.

01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:33.375
Uh, well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:37.750
Guys... without you guys.

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.083
Yeah, right?

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:42.833
Look, I don't know
what to tell you, Officer.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.583
I can't remember a thing.

01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:45.666
What are you doing?

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.833
Why are you-- don't touch me!

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:51.625
Ahh!--You-- aah! Fools-- aah!

01:16:51.666 --> 01:16:54.208
What are you doing,
what are you doing?

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:56.875
Stop! Somebody, stop me!

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:59.125
Ooh!

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:01.000
And, post.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.958
You think she's okay?

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:06.291
Yeah, she'll be all right.
They'll take good care of her.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.583
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.750
This planet belongs to me!

01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:14.041
It is mine!
I tell you, all mine!

01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.791
You kids this to me.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.041
I'm coming for you.

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:21.958
I'm gonna get you.

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:29.000
And there she goes.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.291
Somehow I don't think that's
the last we'll be seeing of her.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:34.583
I think you're probably right.

01:17:34.625 --> 01:17:37.250
So let’s go and bust her out and
arrest Zolthard.

01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:38.750
Easy, Sophie.

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.958
Wait, are you guys
hanging around?

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.166
Correct.

01:17:42.208 --> 01:17:45.000
Yeah. We still needed to deliver
a serious butt kicking.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.250
Anyway, it’s going to be
a while until I can get

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:48.333
these thrusters working.

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.333
It's okay with you if we
stick around for a bit, right?

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.166
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.
I mean, cool.

01:17:54.208 --> 01:17:55.791
Stay as long as you like.

01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:57.166
He's doing it again.

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.625
This will definitely take some
getting used to.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.083
That's good to hear.

01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:05.916
Right, I think we earned
ourselves a little downtime.

01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:08.541
Hey, Norman, what's worth
seeing around here?

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:11.541
Guys, what can we show Max
and crew? They want to see town.

01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.958
We could take them to
the giant ball of string.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:14.541
Oh!

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.166
Or the museum.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.166
Guys, we've got this awesome
Egyptian exhibit

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:19.291
just down the road,
we just gotta check it out.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.791
Hey, Mike,
try to keep up, okay?

01:18:23.208 --> 01:18:24.125
Yeah. Okay.

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:25.541
Just think about it, because--

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.291
I don't want to look at a
bunch of mummies!

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.250
It'll be really cool.
Yeah, we've had enough about it.
