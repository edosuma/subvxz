WEBVTT

00:06.250 --> 00:10.167
Dr. Kim Nichols is a
cosmetic dermatologist.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.626
Dr. Nichols has also requested
for the yacht crew

00:12.626 --> 00:15.792
to always address her
as "Dr. Nichols."

00:15.792 --> 00:16.959
There's slack here, pull.

00:16.959 --> 00:18.751
-I am pulling!
-You're not.

00:18.751 --> 00:21.834
We're a man down, and I do not
deserve to be lashed out on.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.083
That just rope-burned me,
but it's cool.

00:24.083 --> 00:27.083
Regarding our new deckhand,
they should be here

00:27.083 --> 00:29.584
before we pick up
the next charter.

00:29.584 --> 00:35.459
Marcos!

00:35.459 --> 00:37.250
If you're 40 and still
acting like a

00:37.250 --> 00:40.083
----ing stupid-ass dickhead...

00:40.083 --> 00:41.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.792
She was the problem.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.083
And when it's affecting you
and affecting other people,

00:44.083 --> 00:45.626
then there's a problem about it.

00:45.626 --> 00:46.959
-It's affecting many of us.
-You know what I mean?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.792
I'm so embarrassed.

00:48.792 --> 00:52.626
I have some work to do with my
interpersonal relationships,

00:52.626 --> 00:56.209
so I'm feeling that
it's the healthiest thing for me

00:56.209 --> 01:18.167
to leave the boat.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.667
I'm a little bit sad,
because I really like her.

01:20.667 --> 01:21.667
I think we all really like her.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.792
Yeah.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.209
I wish it hadn't come to that,

01:24.209 --> 01:25.501
but I think she'll land
on her feet, though.

01:25.501 --> 01:26.667
I agree.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.209
Anyhow, I'll keep working
on getting a replacement.

01:29.209 --> 01:31.209
-Thanks, Glenn.
-Yep.

01:31.209 --> 01:31.959
Thanks.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.417
I feel like
a massive failure.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.751
I feel like
I failed Gabriela,

01:35.751 --> 01:37.417
I feel like I failed myself,

01:37.417 --> 01:40.959
and I feel like
I've failed the crew.

01:40.959 --> 01:42.209
How do you feel?

01:42.209 --> 01:46.959
I'm a little relieved.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.626
I'm not gonna get to do as much.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.709
Okay, well, I think
it's for the best...

01:50.709 --> 01:52.375
-like, I'm really...
-I think it's for the best too.

01:52.375 --> 01:54.083
and this is not an
ideal situation for me...

01:54.083 --> 01:55.375
No, it's not.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.584
But I think it's
the best thing for her.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.626
-Yeah.
-And, but...

01:59.626 --> 02:00.959
Just remember,
whoever comes in...

02:00.959 --> 02:01.959
I know.

02:01.959 --> 02:03.042
They might be your second stew.

02:03.042 --> 02:04.292
That's fine.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.584
So, you're gonna
listen to them...

02:05.584 --> 02:06.959
I've been listening
to her, Daisy.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.501
...with a big smile.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.042
-I've been listening to her.
-I'm just saying.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.501
But I am gonna move
to the bottom bunk.

02:11.501 --> 02:18.792
That's fine, you can
have the bottom bunk.

02:18.792 --> 02:22.375
I would have liked to see
her finish the season.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.042
-I'm sad.
-Yeah, it sucks.

02:25.042 --> 02:27.292
-Was she okay?
-I think she's okay.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.292
Obviously, it's upsetting.

02:29.292 --> 02:33.167
With where her head is, I think
she made the right decision.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.667
For this charter,
we'll help you guys out.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.167
I hope to have
her replacement here

02:38.167 --> 02:39.459
before the following charter.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.167
Cool.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.584
We'll do our best, all right?

02:41.584 --> 02:42.959
-Okay, cool.
-Yeah, I appreciate it.

02:42.959 --> 02:46.876
-Good, thanks.
-Thanks, Glenn.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.584
Good night.

02:48.584 --> 02:51.959
Good night, Daisy Dukes.

02:51.959 --> 03:04.042
Come in, come in and talk to me.

03:04.042 --> 03:06.292
Try not to sleep
with the new girl.

03:06.292 --> 03:07.709
Why not, what if she's hot?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.751
I came into this season
to find love.

03:09.751 --> 03:11.375
The girl that I really do
like, her name is Daisy,

03:11.375 --> 03:13.459
-I don't know if you know her.
-Shut up.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.792
-Do you think...
-She's really cool.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.459
She's funny,
she's got a cute accent.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.626
Daisy, my heart is devoted
to you.

03:20.626 --> 03:21.959
Shut up.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.125
Okay, I'm going. I'm gonna start
embarrassing myself, bye.

03:24.125 --> 03:30.584
Good night.

03:30.584 --> 03:32.626
-Morning, morning, morning.
-Morning.

03:32.626 --> 03:34.792
How you guys doing?
Did you sleep well?

03:34.792 --> 03:43.417
Cool.

03:43.417 --> 03:46.167
Are you gonna try to take, like,
your break this charter or no?

03:46.167 --> 03:48.209
-I don't really need my breaks.
-Okay.

03:48.209 --> 03:50.751
I think we're gonna be fine.
It's six guests.

03:50.751 --> 03:52.000
We'll work together.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.751
Predominately,
you'll be housekeeping,

03:53.751 --> 03:55.501
but I'm gonna pull you up
for service, don't worry.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.209
Yeah.

03:56.209 --> 03:59.792
But I'm gonna try to give you...

03:59.792 --> 04:01.125
thank you, I appreciate that.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.667
Being a man down, Ashley
and I are gonna have to

04:03.667 --> 04:10.375
work longer hours, and I do
not deal well with being tired.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.709
Anything you need,
let me know.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.292
Thank you, I appreciate that.

04:13.292 --> 04:14.292
I know I'm gonna help you
with service, with plates...

04:14.292 --> 04:16.042
-Yeah.
-Like always.

04:16.042 --> 04:19.125
Gary, Daisy, can you come up
to the wheelhouse for a sec?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.375
So, just I have
an update for you guys.

04:21.375 --> 04:24.375
A deckhand will be here
in an hour.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.375
Okay.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.959
And I'm still working
on the stewardess.

04:27.959 --> 04:29.626
I just wanted to make sure
you guys knew

04:29.626 --> 04:30.959
what's going on in your
departments, thank you.

04:30.959 --> 04:31.959
-Thanks, Glenn.
-Thanks.

04:31.959 --> 04:35.542
-Kels?
-Yeah?

04:35.542 --> 04:37.167
No, to dry this, instead
of going all the way there,

04:37.167 --> 04:39.292
just go like so
and then leave it.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.250
Okay.

04:40.250 --> 04:48.209
The rest you can get,
let's go quickly.

04:48.209 --> 04:49.375
It's a nice boat.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.792
Are you the new deckhand?

04:50.792 --> 04:52.834
-I am.
-Welcome!

04:52.834 --> 04:53.959
I'm Barnaby.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.334
-What's your name?
-Barnaby.

04:55.334 --> 04:57.250
-Bonby?
-Barnaby.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.959
-Barnaby?
-Yeah, that's it.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.375
I'm Kelsie, nice to meet you.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.542
Nice to meet you, Kelsie.

05:01.542 --> 05:04.167
Hallelujah, another
set of hands.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.834
-Hello.
-Hello!

05:05.834 --> 05:08.125
-I'm Barnaby.
-Barnaby.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.417
Pleasure to meet you.

05:09.417 --> 05:10.834
I'm Captain Glenn,
nice to meet you.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.584
Good to meet you, Glenn,
thanks for having me.

05:12.584 --> 05:15.667
He kinda has Jesus hair...
that's a no for me, dawg.

05:15.667 --> 05:16.626
-Gary!
-Yes?

05:16.626 --> 05:17.501
Come on up for a sec.

05:17.501 --> 05:18.918
-Hello.
-Hey, mate, how's it going?

05:18.918 --> 05:20.083
I'm Barnaby.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.292
This is Barnaby,
Gary, first officer.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.584
-What's your name?
-Barnaby.

05:22.584 --> 05:23.584
Barnaby... Gary.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.459
-Nice to meet you.
-Is that a new man I hear?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.584
First superyacht?
Second superyacht,

05:27.584 --> 05:29.626
but I mean, the first one
was only 30 meters, so...

05:29.626 --> 05:31.375
But you have sailing
experience, right?

05:31.375 --> 05:32.959
-Yeah, yeah.
-I saw your CV.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.417
I have quite a lot
of sailing, like...

05:34.417 --> 05:35.959
So, you
understand the difference

05:35.959 --> 05:37.083
between a
sheet and a halyard.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.792
100 percent, 100 percent, yeah.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.959
I grew up in Singapore, and I
started sailing when I was 11.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.375
Dad bought a boat.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.626
Eventually, we were racing
it and we realized,

05:45.626 --> 05:47.167
wow, we're actually
quite good at this.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.375
And then suddenly
we were winning, like,

05:49.375 --> 05:50.667
Singapore national
championships.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.834
We were happy with that,
so we went for it

05:53.834 --> 05:57.334
and got a fast racing boat,
and went off and sailed it

05:57.334 --> 05:59.834
as fast and as hard
as I can, and I love it.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.334
I'm happy to have you here.

06:01.334 --> 06:03.000
We've been without a deckhand
for two charters.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.834
-Oh, good.
-Yeah, So, it's been...

06:04.834 --> 06:07.042
Yeah, so you've come
just in the nick of time.

06:07.042 --> 06:08.792
-He's here!
-Your new boyfriend?

06:08.792 --> 06:10.751
-Not mine.
-Hi, I'm Daisy.

06:10.751 --> 06:12.125
This is Daisy, nice to meet you.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.375
Hi, I'm Barnaby, pleasure to
meet you.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.626
-She's the chief stew on board.
-Hello.

06:14.626 --> 06:15.834
-Welcome.
-Thank you very much.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.083
-Down here?
-Yeah.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.334
Do you need a hand there,
or are you good?

06:18.334 --> 06:19.667
-So, this is the crew mess.
-Hello.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.000
That's Ashley.
Eating, as per usual.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.083
As I put something
in my mouth.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.375
How's it going?
I'm Barnaby.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.792
Hi, I'm Ashley,
nice to meet you.

06:25.792 --> 06:26.959
Pleased to meet you.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.292
This is the galley,
the crew mess.

06:28.292 --> 06:29.626
So, you're bunking
with the captain.

06:29.626 --> 06:30.792
Beautiful.

06:30.792 --> 06:31.959
You can get yourself settled in,

06:31.959 --> 06:33.334
because we pick
up charter today,

06:33.334 --> 06:36.959
and then we're gonna
be pretty hectic.

06:36.959 --> 06:39.626
So, new deckie seems cool.

06:39.626 --> 06:40.709
Very good-looking, yeah.

06:40.709 --> 06:43.959
Is he?

06:43.959 --> 06:45.501
-Like, a good boy.
-A good boy.

06:45.501 --> 06:47.542
-Like the opposite of you.
-Opposite of me, yeah.

06:47.542 --> 06:48.542
-Ah.
-Marcos.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.375
-How you doing?
-Barnaby, pleasure to meet you.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.959
-Nice to meet you, welcome, bro.
-Thank you very much.

06:51.959 --> 06:55.167
All right,
well, this room is vacuumed.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.626
Right, I'm ready for you.

06:56.626 --> 06:57.959
Let's go for a little
walkaround quickly.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.167
Yeah.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.959
So, basically what we're
doing is

07:00.959 --> 07:03.417
we're just giving the boat
a rinse-down and a chamois.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.125
So, this is our cleaning locker.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.667
Chamois live in here,
you can take a new one.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.667
There's your tools,
your weapons.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.167
-See you in a minute.
-Lovely, cheers, mate.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.542
That's fine.

07:14.542 --> 07:15.709
Where are you from?

07:15.709 --> 07:16.834
I'm from Brighton.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.000
Did you come from home?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.334
I was in Greece
when I got the call.

07:21.334 --> 07:22.751
I was on a private island there,

07:22.751 --> 07:25.792
teaching some Greek
billionaires how to, like,

07:25.792 --> 07:27.959
e-foil and wakeboard
and that kind of thing.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.250
Oh, wow.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.459
I'm a water sports instructor,
really.

07:30.459 --> 07:31.334
Okay.

07:31.334 --> 07:33.709
When I was 18, I had a
very lucky break

07:33.709 --> 07:36.167
with going to Necker island
and teaching

07:36.167 --> 07:37.959
kite-surfing to the rich
and famous.

07:37.959 --> 07:41.334
That's on my CV, like,
Barack Obama, Richard Branson,

07:41.334 --> 07:42.667
boom, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.459
I guess it's kind of
similar to this,

07:44.459 --> 07:45.959
just without the water sports.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.626
Yeah.

07:47.626 --> 07:50.375
When you work on superyachts or
you work on private islands,

07:50.375 --> 07:52.667
you know what kind
of lifestyle they have,

07:52.667 --> 07:59.000
and that's annoying,
because I want it so badly.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.417
Boom.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.375
And what did you do to
scare off the last guy?

08:02.375 --> 08:05.501
Long story short,
we ran aground while he was...

08:05.501 --> 08:07.167
-You ran aground?
-...on night watch, yeah.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.959
Oh sh--, how's the keel?

08:08.959 --> 08:10.834
It's all good, boat's all good.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.250
All crew, all crew,
I'd like to see everybody

08:13.250 --> 08:15.959
dressed and in the
cockpit at 10 to.

08:15.959 --> 08:22.751
Good job.

08:22.751 --> 08:24.125
----ing golf ball...

08:24.125 --> 08:25.667
all of this sh--
shouldn't be here.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.918
The boat's looking pretty good,
guys, I must be honest.

08:27.918 --> 08:29.834
----ing smashing it.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.375
Can Kelsie do those napkins?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.959
She needs to stand
the beginning of the line

08:32.959 --> 08:35.209
and Ashley at the end, please.

08:35.209 --> 08:36.626
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

08:36.626 --> 08:39.250
-Oh, my God, it's so pretty.
-Here they come.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.792
Are you ready for this?

08:40.792 --> 08:43.042
Is that the captain?
He's a little fella.

08:43.042 --> 08:44.250
Hello!

08:44.250 --> 08:45.584
Which one of you is the captain?

08:45.584 --> 08:47.792
-I am Captain Glenn.
-Hi, Captain Glenn.

08:47.792 --> 08:49.083
-Are you Dr. Nichols?
-I am.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.459
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:50.459 --> 08:55.584
-Welcome to Menorca.
-It's a pleasure.

08:55.584 --> 08:56.584
Wow.

08:56.584 --> 08:57.584
Hello, everyone!

08:57.584 --> 08:58.667
-Hello.
-Hi.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.167
-I'm Kelsie.
-I'm Colin.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.375
-Barnaby.
-Barnaby.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.542
Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.542
-Hi, Ashley, nice to meet you.
-Here's cheers to us.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.542
I wanna formally welcome you.
You've met the crew.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.709
We've got a lot of fun stuff
planned for you.

09:08.709 --> 09:11.375
We're gonna get going in
a moment, but before we do,

09:11.375 --> 09:13.792
Daisy's gonna take you for
a little tour of the boat,

09:13.792 --> 09:14.959
-all right?
-Yes.

09:14.959 --> 09:15.959
-Thank you.
-That would be amazing.

09:15.959 --> 09:16.959
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

09:16.959 --> 09:19.250
If you follow me up the stairs.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.501
-Ooh, wow.
-Oh, this is fresh.

09:20.501 --> 09:22.167
It's nice place for sailing,

09:22.167 --> 09:23.959
because there's a bit
of a breeze up here.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.334
-Jesus.
-[bleep]

09:25.334 --> 09:28.334
This is a lot of bags.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.792
In here we have the main saloon.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.459
-This is another dining area.
-Love it.

09:31.459 --> 09:32.667
And then obviously the bar,

09:32.667 --> 09:34.834
which is an also
fun place to hang out.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.083
Yeah.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.501
-Is that it, mate?
-No, six more.

09:38.501 --> 09:41.667
It's amazing how big these
things are, you know?

09:41.667 --> 09:43.501
So, in here we have
the master cabin.

09:43.501 --> 09:47.584
Baby, this master
is ridiculous.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.375
[laughing]

09:49.375 --> 09:51.709
-----ing hell.
-Two days.

09:51.709 --> 09:53.125
Holy sh--.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.792
-So, that's all of it?
-Yeah... is that enough?

09:54.792 --> 09:56.209
Could I swap something out?

09:56.209 --> 09:57.459
Yeah, of course, what would
everyone like, I will...

09:57.459 --> 09:58.542
Bloody Mary?

09:58.542 --> 10:00.083
You don't have Bloody Marys,
do you, by chance?

10:00.083 --> 10:01.542
Yeah, I can do a Bloody Mary.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.000
I want a bacon Bloody Mary
with grilled shrimp...

10:03.000 --> 10:04.501
how's that for an order, okay?

10:04.501 --> 10:05.792
Bacon...

10:05.792 --> 10:07.292
A double bacon Bloody Mary with
two grilled shrimp, no olives.

10:07.292 --> 10:08.584
Two grilled shrimp.

10:08.584 --> 10:11.876
I'll have the same,
but with olives.

10:11.876 --> 10:12.959
I'd like a Transfusion.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.292
Ooh, okay.

10:14.292 --> 10:17.667
Equal parts vodka,
ginger ale, and grape...

10:17.667 --> 10:18.667
not grapefruit, grape juice.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.250
Ooh...

10:20.250 --> 10:21.876
grape juice doesn't really
exist in Europe, unfortunately.

10:21.876 --> 10:23.501
-Yeah.
-We have cranberry juice.

10:23.501 --> 10:24.876
It's not the same
with cranberry.

10:24.876 --> 10:25.959
No, do the pineapple one.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.375
I wanted a Transfusion.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.584
I think they make a lot of wine;
they have grapes.

10:28.584 --> 10:29.501
That's true.

10:29.501 --> 10:31.417
-Do you have...
-Here's my fake laugh.

10:31.417 --> 10:32.584
[fake laugh]

10:32.584 --> 10:35.250
Okay, so two Bloody Marys,
Grey Goose with cran and...

10:35.250 --> 10:36.250
No, Bloody Marys with
shrimp and bacon.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.584
Yes, I've got those.

10:37.584 --> 10:39.584
Cran with limes,
and tequila on the rocks.

10:39.584 --> 10:41.334
-And I'm easy.
-What would you like?

10:41.334 --> 10:42.959
I'll just do a Grey Goose
and tonic with two limes.

10:42.959 --> 10:47.584
I think we should do
a shot of the tequila.

10:47.584 --> 10:51.584
We're ----ed.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.417
Okay, so two Bloody Marys,
Grey Goose with cran and...

10:54.417 --> 10:55.417
No, Bloody Marys with
shrimp and bacon.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.751
Yes, I've got those.

10:56.751 --> 10:58.292
Cran with limes,
and tequila on the rocks.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.918
-And I'm easy.
-What would you like?

10:59.918 --> 11:01.459
I'll just do a Grey Goose
and tonic with two limes.

11:01.459 --> 11:03.417
I think we should do
a shot of the tequila.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.334
-Okay, six tequila shots?
-Yeah, chilled.

11:05.334 --> 11:06.626
Teach her how to do the thing.

11:06.626 --> 11:07.542
We're ----ed.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.834
-We are ----ed?
-Yeah, we're ----ed.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.501
It's exactly
what we didn't need.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.000
Being ----ing slammed
with cocktails.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.959
Can I get some grilled shrimp,
please,

11:14.959 --> 11:16.959
and some bacon for Bloody Marys?

11:16.959 --> 11:19.667
-Okay.
-Thank you.

11:19.667 --> 11:24.667
[shouting]

11:24.667 --> 11:27.167
Open-faced slider,
onion compote.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.083
-Thank you so much.
-You're very welcome.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.834
-Cheers, ladies.
-Salud.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.209
Jesus.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.417
Look at these tiny little
cheeseburgers, how cute.

11:35.417 --> 11:39.000
Open-faced sliders, cheddar
cheese and béarnaise sauce.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.417
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.125
Okay, I guess that's us
ready to rock and roll.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.459
All right, you have
two right here for...

11:44.459 --> 11:45.959
Oh, I need two shrimp,
he said specifically

11:45.959 --> 11:47.584
two grilled shrimp, I'm sorry.

11:47.584 --> 11:50.792
-It's okay, I'll do this.
-He's very particular.

11:50.792 --> 11:51.834
Appreciate it, thank you.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.584
Forward open, forward closed.

11:54.584 --> 11:56.042
Yeah, and that's just
for fenders, eh?

11:56.042 --> 11:59.167
-Just for fenders, yeah.
-It must be huge.

11:59.167 --> 12:00.292
A little weak on the bacon.

12:00.292 --> 12:02.083
I can ask for more.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.375
Weak. Weak bacon.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.959
You need two stalks of
bacon in there.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.584
Look at this...

12:06.584 --> 12:08.792
I asked for two
grilled jumbo shrimp.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.459
Look at the size of these
things, look at this.

12:10.459 --> 12:13.792
Okay, just an FYI, he said
it's weak on the bacon,

12:13.792 --> 12:15.626
so it needs to be,
like, America bacon,

12:15.626 --> 12:16.751
like stacked... yeah.

12:16.751 --> 12:19.959
If a guest is gonna complain
for something that small

12:19.959 --> 12:22.959
in the beginning of the charter,
they're gonna be demanding.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.375
This is embarrassment.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.792
You want, like,
two stalks of bacon in there,

12:25.792 --> 12:27.209
and the big shrimp.

12:27.209 --> 12:29.834
I know it's more coming.
It's not gonna end.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.501
He want the whole strip?

12:31.501 --> 12:32.918
Just more bacon.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.584
I got it, I got it, no worries.

12:34.584 --> 12:35.834
All right, mate,
when we're getting off,

12:35.834 --> 12:37.250
where do you want me?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.959
You can take the aft running
spring off if you want.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.209
Start getting lines off.

12:40.209 --> 12:41.959
The main bow line's
just come off,

12:41.959 --> 12:43.209
and now it's supposed to be
this spring, is that correct?

12:43.209 --> 12:44.459
Yeah, you can ease that off.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.209
Okay, try not to get them wet.

12:46.209 --> 12:48.459
Pull in...
pull, pull, pull... nice.

12:48.459 --> 12:50.292
Okay, Glenn,
that's all lines clear.

12:50.292 --> 12:52.542
-Thanks, mate.
-Now we coil them.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.709
Coiling these?

12:55.709 --> 12:59.083
They're so heavy.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.542
Yeah, we can,
yeah, yeah, for sure.

13:00.542 --> 13:03.626
Please, yeah, thank you so much.

13:03.626 --> 13:06.459
These lines are a workout,
----ing hell.

13:06.459 --> 13:07.459
Really good job.

13:07.459 --> 13:08.959
No, baby, you don't
have to steam anything

13:08.959 --> 13:10.584
for me this weekend.

13:10.584 --> 13:11.918
I'm gonna have the people
do it, okay? Don't worry.

13:11.918 --> 13:21.626
You take a break
this weekend, honey.

13:21.626 --> 13:22.667
Cool.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.000
We won't be sleeping
for the next three days.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.292
That's fine, yeah.

13:25.292 --> 13:29.292
And they want
everything steamed.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.000
I don't even know where
to begin doing that.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Everything?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.751
So, it's gotta be...

13:33.751 --> 13:34.959
No, what the plan is is you're
gonna go down to the master,

13:34.959 --> 13:36.542
I'm gonna stay on service,

13:36.542 --> 13:40.334
and anything that clearly
needs to be ironed, iron it.

13:40.334 --> 13:50.584
Yeah.

13:50.584 --> 13:51.626
What's up, guys?

13:51.626 --> 13:53.501
-Hello, how are you, man?
-Good, how are you?

13:53.501 --> 13:54.542
Good.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.876
Wow, this is dope.

13:56.876 --> 13:58.334
What are you whipping up now?

13:58.334 --> 14:00.959
A Cosmopolitan for Chris.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.501
What can I get you?

14:02.501 --> 14:05.834
-I'll have a nice, cold beer.
-Yeah.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.959
There's a [bleep]-load
of sh--, though.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.959
Oh, Lord.

14:09.959 --> 14:13.584
Here you go. Just be careful of
the glass, because it breaks...

14:13.584 --> 14:15.375
-You are the best, no problem.
-...super easy in this wind.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.626
Are there other lay-down setups
that we can have out here?

14:17.626 --> 14:25.959
Let me check for you.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.000
We've only got three.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.626
-Get these cushions...
-Yeah?

14:28.626 --> 14:31.375
and jam a few extra cushions
underneath the backrest...

14:31.375 --> 14:32.000
Yeah?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.501
so it feels like a lounger.

14:33.501 --> 14:34.834
Yeah, they said they were
fine if the guys

14:34.834 --> 14:36.667
just laid on
some cushion.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.501
Thank you, Gary.

14:38.501 --> 14:39.709
Now, do you wanna
give a hand here?

14:39.709 --> 14:41.501
Okay.

14:41.501 --> 14:42.876
We're gonna take those and
we're gonna put them forward

14:42.876 --> 14:44.959
so the gentlemen can
lie on them.

14:44.959 --> 14:46.167
They're Velcroed on.

14:46.167 --> 14:52.375
I'm gonna give you a big tip.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.584
We haven't got time for that.

14:53.584 --> 14:54.876
Would you guys like to
face each other?

14:54.876 --> 14:56.459
-Yes.
-Yeah.

14:56.459 --> 14:58.000
Sure.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.292
-Thank you, man.
-Thank you.

14:59.292 --> 15:00.584
You're welcome.

15:00.584 --> 15:02.000
You know what,
let me get a refresher.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.375
A refresher?

15:03.375 --> 15:04.542
Just because it gets
diluted so quickly.

15:04.542 --> 15:05.501
Oh, right.

15:05.501 --> 15:07.876
Grey Goose and tonic,
mas ice, por favor.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.501
[speaking Spanish]

15:09.501 --> 15:12.417
Can I do another one of those,
but with some crushed ice in it.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.834
Crushed ice instead, okay.

15:15.834 --> 15:21.083
He'd like another one of these,
I don't know what it is...

15:21.083 --> 15:22.626
Sorry, she said the ice
melted too quick,

15:22.626 --> 15:23.751
so she needs a top-up.

15:23.751 --> 15:26.667
It's gonna be one of those
charters, I know it.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.209
I definitely don't think
these guests have realized

15:29.209 --> 15:31.125
that we are a stew down.

15:31.125 --> 15:34.167
But even if they did,
I'm pretty sure

15:34.167 --> 15:38.417
they couldn't give a [bleep].

15:38.417 --> 15:41.375
You okay if we get
a little bit of sail up?

15:41.375 --> 15:42.834
-Here we go, Dr. Nichols.
-Thank you.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.792
You're welcome.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.167
We're gonna try and get
some sail up right now.

15:46.167 --> 15:53.125
-Yeah.
-Cool.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.584
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.209
I think there's enough wind
to sail,

15:56.209 --> 15:58.375
but the wind's literally
just swung 180 degrees.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.626
There is some real breeze,
though. Let's do it.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.501
Okay, so what we do is we
just watch the sail

16:02.501 --> 16:04.792
to make sure that it goes
up into the pre-feeder.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.292
You don't want it to be
pulling on that,

16:06.292 --> 16:07.626
because what can happen is
the boltrope...

16:07.626 --> 16:09.167
-you know what the boltrope is?
-Yeah, yeah.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.501
You don't want that popping out,

16:10.501 --> 16:11.542
because that's a ----ing
mission to fix.

16:11.542 --> 16:12.918
Yeah, I'll watch for that.

16:12.918 --> 16:15.876
Okay, I'll be on the main.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.375
Okay, stop there.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.250
Good?

16:20.250 --> 16:24.000
One and a half wraps left.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.167
-Hold!
-Gennie.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.876
We're sailing.

16:27.876 --> 16:29.709
-That.
-Engines off.

16:29.709 --> 16:33.834
-Yeah, baby.
-This is all right.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.667
Yeah, that's pretty
cool, isn't it?

16:35.667 --> 16:39.083
[snoring]

16:39.083 --> 16:40.542
Dolphins on the bow.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.417
Look at these dolphins
right here.

16:42.417 --> 16:43.667
Holy moly.

16:43.667 --> 16:47.959
Dr. Nichols.

16:47.959 --> 16:47.959
Oh, my Lord.
Fast asleep.

16:47.959 --> 16:55.375
Okay, so two Bloody Marys,
Grey Goose with cran and...

16:55.375 --> 16:57.125
There goes the sun.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.584
I think we gotta go
to the top deck.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.042
I caught a couple
of Z's up here, huh...

17:00.042 --> 17:01.125
oh, I was dreaming.

17:01.125 --> 17:04.209
[snoring]

17:04.209 --> 17:05.292
Good, he's watching
her to make sure

17:05.292 --> 17:06.334
she doesn't go tumbling off.

17:06.334 --> 17:07.834
I got thirsty again.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.626
Ashley!

17:09.626 --> 17:14.209
Help!

17:14.209 --> 17:15.959
Hey, Colin, could you
call Ashley or somebody

17:15.959 --> 17:17.959
to help us out with some drinks
and stuff like that?

17:17.959 --> 17:20.501
-Yeah.
-Thanks, man.

17:20.501 --> 17:22.584
-They all want drinks.
-Yeah, coming.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.375
Okay, let's put the lazy away.

17:24.375 --> 17:27.751
Barnaby, the lazy sheet,
pull it against that halyard,

17:27.751 --> 17:29.667
so it wraps so there's tension
on the capstan,

17:29.667 --> 17:32.918
-and then I'm gonna pull it in.
-Here you go.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.250
What can I get you?

17:34.250 --> 17:37.459
-I'll do a cold Heineken Zero.
-Okay.

17:37.459 --> 17:39.584
Perfect, look at them.
I told him once.

17:39.584 --> 17:43.792
Ah, right.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.083
Barnaby's doing a
phenomenal job.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.584
He's hit the ground running.

17:46.584 --> 17:47.959
Yeah, let's drop
the main and mizzen.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.584
It's great to see
that my deck team

17:49.584 --> 17:51.083
is finally shaping up nicely.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.000
It's coming back too far.
We want it sort of...

17:53.000 --> 17:54.334
-Yeah...
-More vertical.

17:54.334 --> 17:58.792
-So, you just tell him forward.
-Forward.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.959
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

18:00.959 --> 18:05.959
Wait, I missed the whole sail?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.959
Thank God they're only
here for two days.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.626
Like, they're the kind of
people that leave their drinks

18:09.626 --> 18:13.125
half-drunk and then go oh,
we need another drink.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.167
It's very wasteful,
in my opinion.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.167
When I see my
coworkers drowning,

18:17.167 --> 18:19.459
I need to help them somehow.

18:19.459 --> 18:21.792
So, how I'm gonna do this?

18:21.792 --> 18:23.459
So, it's a lot
of pressure for me,

18:23.459 --> 18:27.209
because now if my food sucks,
we have double problem.

18:27.209 --> 18:30.250
Does anyone need anything?

18:30.250 --> 18:31.501
-Yeah, you want that?
-Okay, sure.

18:31.501 --> 18:32.876
[bleep] she's sexy.

18:32.876 --> 18:34.417
Imagine you had a doctor
that looked like that.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.751
Honey, I've gotta go
to the doctor.

18:36.751 --> 18:39.042
What, again?

18:39.042 --> 18:40.792
-Constant flu.
-Yeah, constant flu.

18:40.792 --> 19:05.751
----ing hell.

19:05.751 --> 19:07.083
How are you getting on?

19:07.083 --> 19:08.959
Good enough.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.292
This is all of it.

19:10.292 --> 19:12.417
We need to drop it,
disengage the clutch.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.250
-Yeah.
-If we need to pick up...

19:14.250 --> 19:15.584
Undo the brake,
up and down on here.

19:15.584 --> 19:22.626
Okay, Colin, let her go,
let her go, let her go.

19:22.626 --> 19:26.375
Here you go, you're welcome.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.375
All right, we're done, thanks.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.125
-No, don't eat that piece.
-Why?

19:31.125 --> 19:32.459
Because it dropped on the floor.

19:32.459 --> 19:37.584
-You're such a...
-I promise it did!

19:37.584 --> 19:39.209
Kim's hanging off the front
of the ----ing boat.

19:39.209 --> 19:40.584
Do you see where she is?

19:40.584 --> 19:42.209
Come on, you're
dangerous over there!

19:42.209 --> 19:43.918
Babe, let's go up top.

19:43.918 --> 19:45.584
I'm loving this right now, baby.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.542
You're gonna fall off the
boat and ----ing die.

19:47.542 --> 19:48.542
[laughing]

19:48.542 --> 19:49.959
Ha ha ha ha.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.459
Oh, for romance!

19:52.459 --> 19:53.959
So, guys, what do you
think of the deckhand?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.292
Let's talk about him
while he's not here.

19:55.292 --> 19:56.918
What do you think about him?

19:56.918 --> 19:58.125
I like him.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.459
Looks like you lucked out.

19:59.459 --> 20:04.250
Yeah, maybe I can
finally get laid.

20:04.250 --> 20:10.792
I think you already did.
You just don't remember.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.626
-No, this is not warm enough.
-You want it warm?

20:12.626 --> 20:13.584
This is not warm enough.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.959
Hey, team, how do I get
the hot tub hotter?

20:15.959 --> 20:17.209
I'll come for you now.

20:17.209 --> 20:18.584
-Start pulling for dinner.
-Yeah.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.375
What did they say,
half-nine, 10:00?

20:20.375 --> 20:23.250
[bleep], what the ----ing...
[bleep] off.

20:23.250 --> 20:27.125
-Here you go, love.
-Gracias.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.209
What would you like?

20:28.209 --> 20:30.918
-One without...
-Ice? Okay.

20:30.918 --> 20:32.792
Yeah, no worries, hon.

20:32.792 --> 20:37.083
No.

20:37.083 --> 20:40.334
Cutlery...
big knife and fork.

20:40.334 --> 20:42.542
Oh, the meat is the fourth one.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.292
Four, five...
I have five.

20:44.292 --> 20:45.709
-Okay.
-Oh, I could eat now.

20:45.709 --> 20:49.417
Yeah, I'm hungry too.

20:49.417 --> 20:54.000
Let me see what I can do.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.083
-Marcos?
-Yeah.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.292
They want snacks.

20:56.292 --> 20:57.959
[bleep] Okay, here we go.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.083
-Okay.
-Like, clams casino.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.959
-Okay, gimme some time.
-Okay.

21:01.959 --> 21:06.834
-So, you wake up at 6:00, yeah?
-Yeah.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.375
Twenty knots.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.876
Yeah, I mean, I know tonight
it's gonna be 20 knots,

21:09.876 --> 21:11.626
so I've got a feeling
Kelsie will wake me up,

21:11.626 --> 21:14.751
but that's fine.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.584
Yeah.

21:16.584 --> 21:17.709
Ooh!

21:17.709 --> 21:21.042
Oysters.

21:21.042 --> 21:22.375
-Yeah?
-All right, perfect.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.375
Do you want a little ice
in yours as well?

21:23.375 --> 21:24.834
-Yes.
-Yeah?

21:24.834 --> 21:26.375
Just freshen this up,
I'd appreciate it.

21:26.375 --> 21:27.792
-Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
-Thank you so much.

21:27.792 --> 21:28.959
-Here you go, you're welcome.
-Thank you!

21:28.959 --> 21:31.083
You're welcome.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.375
I think 10:00.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.959
-What time is it?
-It's 8:05.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.792
Daisy, 9:00... dinner, 9:00.

21:35.792 --> 21:36.792
Dinner...

21:36.792 --> 21:37.792
A little prosciutto on the side.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.000
9:00 p.m.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.792
No, Gordo, not 10:30,
Gordo, 10:00.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.417
I'll be asleep-sleep.

21:44.417 --> 21:47.042
You don't tell me
what to do, ever... ever.

21:47.042 --> 21:51.125
Nunca.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.959
Are they fighting?

21:52.959 --> 21:56.083
I'm not having
dinner at 10:30.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.000
Oh, about dinner time?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.417
You can go jump off the boat...

22:00.417 --> 22:03.751
tell me what to do.
Get the [bleep] out.

22:03.751 --> 22:05.375
If you mess with me,
then I'm gonna...

22:05.375 --> 22:06.959
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.459
I'm gonna take a knife and

22:08.459 --> 22:14.167
I'm gonna stab you
in the throat.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.959
I'll go the second
you're ready.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.834
What time do you
want to do dinner?

22:17.834 --> 22:18.834
You tell me.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.501
If 10:00 suits you, 10:30...

22:20.501 --> 22:22.501
-No, 10:30's too much.
-Yeah.

22:22.501 --> 22:23.167
[bleep]

22:23.167 --> 22:24.959
10:30's a ridiculous time.

22:24.959 --> 22:29.125
It's gonna be a long ----ing
night, that's for sure.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.417
I'm just not gonna say anything,

22:30.417 --> 22:31.584
and I'm just gonna
go with 10:00.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.417
Yeah.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.167
[bleep] what are
they doing up here.

22:34.167 --> 22:37.751
Lord.

22:37.751 --> 22:38.959
----ing hell.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.959
----ing stupid... stupid jars.

22:41.959 --> 22:43.584
That bin needs to go out.

22:43.584 --> 22:46.250
Yeah, that's all good,
let me know where you need me.

22:46.250 --> 22:49.417
Thank you.

22:49.417 --> 22:52.959
Meh.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.167
Hey, Ashley...

22:55.167 --> 22:57.834
Okay.

22:57.834 --> 23:10.375
Oh, it's good?

23:10.375 --> 23:11.792
They're still in bed,

23:11.792 --> 23:14.792
so I'm gonna assume that
dinner is for 10:30.

23:14.792 --> 23:15.709
Okay.

23:15.709 --> 23:18.125
Ah, you're having a nap
during dinner,

23:18.125 --> 23:24.167
it means we can't serve
you your dinner.

23:24.167 --> 23:25.584
Are you going to wear shoes?

23:25.584 --> 23:27.626
-Wear what you want.
-Okay.

23:27.626 --> 23:32.167
-It's gonna be...
-A long night, bru.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.792
-Okay, are we ready?
-Let's do it.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.292
-Vaya.
-Oi, mami!

23:35.292 --> 23:36.375
-Vamos!
-Mami!

23:36.375 --> 23:37.751
Oh, wow, look at the dinner.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.792
Wow, look at this setup,
it's gorgeous.

23:39.792 --> 23:43.584
Marcos, they are just sitting
down, and I'm about to do wine.

23:43.584 --> 23:46.626
Copy that.

23:46.626 --> 23:50.584
-Hey now.
-Keep the ladies inside.

23:50.584 --> 23:51.751
Would you like some white wine?

23:51.751 --> 23:54.459
I have a crave for
another martini.

23:54.459 --> 23:56.501
Oh, yeah, sure absolutely.
I'll get you one.

23:56.501 --> 23:58.542
I would like another
lychee martini.

23:58.542 --> 23:59.751
-Okay.
-And the wine with dinner.

23:59.751 --> 24:02.959
Okay.

24:02.959 --> 24:03.959
Sure.

24:03.959 --> 24:05.167
I love that sh--.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.542
Are you that way
inclined, or what?

24:06.542 --> 24:08.709
I used to go and hide
in there for hours.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.584
Hey, Ashley, I'm gonna
make a vodka martini,

24:11.584 --> 24:13.375
if you can make two
lychee martinis,

24:13.375 --> 24:15.584
and then I'm gonna start going.

24:15.584 --> 24:19.584
[humming]

24:19.584 --> 24:31.792
I'm ready with the first course.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.792
Here's to Chris making
it through tonight.

24:33.792 --> 24:34.834
You can go first.

24:34.834 --> 24:39.459
All at the same time.

24:39.459 --> 24:41.292
Ah, look at this service
we're getting.

24:41.292 --> 24:42.792
The presentation, beautiful.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.751
-Thank you so much.
-So, what do we have here?

24:44.751 --> 24:51.959
So, we have a... uh...

24:51.959 --> 24:53.375
Yeah, it's hard to concentrate

24:53.375 --> 24:56.542
when she have a nipple
saying, "Hello, Marcos."

24:56.542 --> 24:58.334
"Tsk, tsk, tsk, I'm here!"

24:58.334 --> 25:00.959
We have a Spanish
tortilla with chorizo.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.501
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

25:02.501 --> 25:05.292
Oh, my God, so good.

25:05.292 --> 25:06.709
She's showing the boob.

25:06.709 --> 25:08.375
I lost my...
I couldn't explain the plate.

25:08.375 --> 25:12.375
I was, like, "It's mancina
with tits, and...

25:12.375 --> 25:14.667
a little nipple
on the top."

25:14.667 --> 25:16.375
There's a lot of utensils
going on here.

25:16.375 --> 25:17.542
I don't know which one's which.

25:17.542 --> 25:18.959
Yeah, Kim, fix that please.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.792
Poor Dino, how's he
supposed to eat dinner?

25:20.792 --> 25:24.959
I got it.

25:24.959 --> 25:26.125
-Oh!
-Gazpacho?

25:26.125 --> 25:27.125
Your favorite,
French onion soup.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.334
-Onion soup?
-Oh!

25:28.334 --> 25:30.959
-Enjoy, guys.
-Thank you so much.

25:30.959 --> 25:33.292
Oh, my God, so good, right?

25:33.292 --> 25:34.959
-Right?
-Yes!

25:34.959 --> 25:36.250
That's what I'm saying.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.792
All right, I'm gonna
go back down.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.125
Thank you.

25:39.125 --> 25:40.626
That looks beautiful, mate.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.375
Thank you, bro.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.834
Gary, do you think
you could help?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.167
Sure.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.501
What's the young lady's
name serving us?

25:45.501 --> 25:46.959
-One is Ashley.
-Daisy. Daisy.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.501
-Gary, you're a server tonight?
-I am, yeah.

25:48.501 --> 25:52.501
We got Mediterranean
branzino with scallop.

25:52.501 --> 25:54.626
Oh, my God,
that is so embarrassing.

25:54.626 --> 25:56.334
Enjoy it, guys.

25:56.334 --> 25:57.751
This branzino's unbelievable.

25:57.751 --> 26:00.375
We need a chef.

26:00.375 --> 26:04.792
He speaks Spanish,
it would be amazing.

26:04.792 --> 26:05.959
We ready to go, yeah?

26:05.959 --> 26:07.125
Wait.

26:07.125 --> 26:10.375
-Are you coming, Cheffy?
-Yeah, wait.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.459
-Oh!
-Baby, look at this.

26:12.459 --> 26:13.709
-A tomahawk.
-Wow.

26:13.709 --> 26:16.083
Que bonito.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.334
-Yes.
-Thank you, guys.

26:18.334 --> 26:20.751
-Dino, the steak is ridiculous.
-Excellent.

26:20.751 --> 26:22.417
Last one coming up, Captain,
and that's it.

26:22.417 --> 26:23.501
Good, I'm going to bed.

26:23.501 --> 26:25.125
Are you enjoying yourselves?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.709
No, the food is,
like, ridiculous.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.459
We gotta get you
some help, though.

26:28.459 --> 26:30.042
You need a couple of bussers
or something, some people.

26:30.042 --> 26:31.125
Where are your girls?

26:31.125 --> 26:32.292
You're the only one helping us.

26:32.292 --> 26:33.584
No, we normally
have three girls,

26:33.584 --> 26:37.792
but unfortunately,
someone had to go home.

26:37.792 --> 26:39.959
Jesus Christ.

26:39.959 --> 26:43.125
[bleep]

26:43.125 --> 26:45.125
I would be a cannibal
in a segundo.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.959
Un segundo.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.125
Let's go.

26:49.125 --> 26:50.375
This is number five, right?

26:50.375 --> 26:51.542
So, what is it, poached pear?

26:51.542 --> 26:52.709
Poached pear with Bordeaux.

26:52.709 --> 26:57.459
-Is this dessert?
-Yes.

26:57.459 --> 26:59.125
[bleep] you ----ing kidding me?

26:59.125 --> 27:00.959
What's going on here?

27:00.959 --> 27:02.959
Marcos, we've been
looking for a chef.

27:02.959 --> 27:04.417
Thank you.

27:04.417 --> 27:09.501
And you want a permanent job,
whatever you want.

27:09.501 --> 27:10.792
Oh sh--, shake it,
shake it,

27:10.792 --> 27:13.501
keep it together,
keep it together.

27:13.501 --> 27:16.167
Thank you, guys.
See you tomorrow, eh?

27:16.167 --> 27:19.334
Good night.
I'm a very dumb doctor.

27:19.334 --> 27:20.834
Ashley, you can go to bed.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.083
Thank you for your help tonight.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.542
I wanna get jiggy with it.

27:25.542 --> 27:26.834
We'll dance but we're definitely
not getting jiggy with it.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.334
Give us six shots
of coffee Patrón.

27:28.334 --> 27:29.709
Okay, sure.

27:29.709 --> 27:30.959
Six shots, chill it up,
though, chill it nice.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.542
Okay.

27:33.542 --> 27:41.250
I'm gonna go skinny-dipping.
I'm going in the water.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.417
All right, have
a good one, chaps.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.083
See you in the morning.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.292
-Oh, ho!
-Here you go.

27:45.292 --> 27:47.250
Are these espresso
martini shots?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.792
It's café Patrón.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.292
No [bleep] you, bitch,
I'm not...

27:50.292 --> 27:52.000
I'm not 18 years old.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.375
-Daisy, would you--
-I'll never do...

27:55.375 --> 27:56.792
[overlapping dialogue]

27:56.792 --> 27:58.542
[sighs]

27:58.542 --> 28:00.125
Never in my ----ing life.

28:00.125 --> 28:02.000
-Yo, let's go up top.
-There's no music up there.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.667
Yeah, they could put the music.

28:03.667 --> 28:04.959
-I'll put the music.
-There's no music up there.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.417
Daisy, can we get
this music upstairs?

28:07.417 --> 28:08.834
-Can we go upstairs?
-On the flybridge?

28:08.834 --> 28:10.959
Yes, I'll set...
I'll put it up there.

28:10.959 --> 28:12.959
Baby, she's gonna put
this music upstairs for us.

28:12.959 --> 28:16.250
Let's go, vamanos,
vamanos, vamanos.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.626
Gary, can someone start
clearing the table?

28:18.626 --> 28:20.584
-I'll start clearing the table.
-Thanks.

28:20.584 --> 28:23.209
Ah, I think it's nice.

28:23.209 --> 28:24.459
I'll have the Azul.

28:24.459 --> 28:25.667
Would you like
that on the rocks?

28:25.667 --> 28:26.751
Yes, I would.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.250
-We just need some music.
-Do you need a blanket?

28:28.250 --> 28:29.792
They got blankets, right?

28:29.792 --> 28:32.959
Hello, help!

28:32.959 --> 28:34.250
And Pedro, what would you like?

28:34.250 --> 28:35.501
I want some tequila
on the rocks?

28:35.501 --> 28:36.501
-I'll have the same.
-Same?

28:36.501 --> 28:38.125
He's like my girlfriend.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.292
Can I get some music
and blankets?

28:40.292 --> 28:41.542
We're getting tequila,
you want tequila?

28:41.542 --> 28:42.959
Everybody's gonna go to bed

28:42.959 --> 28:44.584
if we don't get music
and blankets, like...

28:44.584 --> 28:46.125
-You want Clase Azul?
-...in three minutes.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.125
Chris, you want a Clase Azul?

28:47.125 --> 28:48.959
Not really.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.292
But then give us three, then.

28:50.292 --> 28:51.876
I want a blanket and music.

28:51.876 --> 28:54.167
Oh, then why are
we going upstairs for?

28:54.167 --> 28:55.542
Because it's nicer up here.

28:55.542 --> 28:56.876
-It's cold, I want...
-It's not cold.

28:56.876 --> 28:58.584
I know, we're getting
a blanket, man.

28:58.584 --> 29:01.584
There's nobody...
there's nobody on this boat.

29:01.584 --> 29:03.375
The boat's understaffed, man.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.751
-Come here.
-Come over here, Pedro.

29:05.751 --> 29:07.584
Yeah, I think they're
gonna be up for a while.

29:07.584 --> 29:09.876
[bleep] yeah,
they gonna be up for ages.

29:09.876 --> 29:11.834
-You ready?
-Shots!

29:11.834 --> 29:17.667
Yeah! It's time!

29:17.667 --> 29:19.125
There she is, she's got
a blanket for you.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.167
This is all falling on you,
I feel terrible for you.

29:21.167 --> 29:23.167
That's okay, I don't mind,
it's a pleasure.

29:23.167 --> 29:24.834
I know, but you're gonna be
a million places at once,

29:24.834 --> 29:25.959
it's not enough.

29:25.959 --> 29:27.334
You want me to make you a drink?

29:27.334 --> 29:30.501
Okay, can we change
the bartender, please?

29:30.501 --> 29:31.751
He doesn't know what he's doing.

29:31.751 --> 29:32.667
[bleep]

29:32.667 --> 29:34.125
I think he's a
pretty cute bartender.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.584
You want some ice?

29:35.584 --> 29:36.834
Yeah, there's no ice,
the machine's done.

29:36.834 --> 29:37.959
Please.

29:37.959 --> 29:39.667
If you give me a second,
I'll be down in a moment.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.167
I'm just trying
to sort the music out.

29:41.167 --> 29:42.667
I need a shot of Sambuca.

29:42.667 --> 29:43.751
I wanna dance.

29:43.751 --> 29:45.542
I can't get this thing...
this should connect.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.042
I'm getting ----ing
totally aggravated

29:47.042 --> 29:48.751
with the ----ing whole crew.

29:48.751 --> 29:51.918
Do you want me to try and
play it through the speaker?

29:51.918 --> 29:54.125
If you don't ----ing make this
sh-- work right now...

29:54.125 --> 29:55.626
Come on, help me out, man.

29:55.626 --> 29:57.083
We wanna hear a little
music before we go to bed,

29:57.083 --> 29:58.459
what the [bleep]?

29:58.459 --> 30:00.209
You're getting me
really ----ing pissed.

30:00.209 --> 30:01.792
-Daisy!
-Oh, my God.

30:01.792 --> 30:04.083
-Espresso martini.
-Couple espressos.

30:04.083 --> 30:07.292
Oh, my God, shut the [bleep] up.

30:07.292 --> 30:08.334
Let's go.

30:08.334 --> 30:09.584
[bleep] this sh--.

30:09.584 --> 30:10.792
-Don't leave.
-I'm done.

30:10.792 --> 30:11.459
Baby, don't leave.

30:11.459 --> 30:12.834
No, I don't... I'm done.

30:12.834 --> 30:15.792
This came to an abrupt ending.

30:15.792 --> 30:16.959
-Daisy, here.
-Yes?

30:16.959 --> 30:18.667
That's for the aggravation
for tonight, because...

30:18.667 --> 30:20.250
-No, no, no...
-That's for the table.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.417
No, no, no...
honestly, I can't accept... oh!

30:22.417 --> 30:24.667
He can take that ----ing
hundred-euro note

30:24.667 --> 30:27.083
and shove it
so far up his hole.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.250
We got thrown outta here.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.375
He has no class, no manners,

30:30.375 --> 30:39.918
and he's a moron
who doesn't deserve his wife.

30:39.918 --> 30:39.918
Oh.

30:39.918 --> 30:51.417
There goes the sun.

30:51.417 --> 30:55.709
Ooh.

30:55.709 --> 31:07.959
Oh sh--, ugh!

31:07.959 --> 31:20.751
[sighs]

31:20.751 --> 31:23.584
Good morning.

31:23.584 --> 31:25.751
Okay.

31:25.751 --> 31:32.375
[yawns]

31:32.375 --> 31:35.584
They drank a lot yesterday.

31:35.584 --> 31:36.959
-Long night?
-2:00 a.m.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.000
2:00?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.125
Were they still
eating at 2:00?

31:41.125 --> 31:42.167
That makes sense.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.459
They really enjoyed it.

31:43.459 --> 31:44.751
Oh, they looked like they
were having

31:44.751 --> 31:46.459
a lot of fun last night,
which is good.

31:46.459 --> 31:48.042
-That's what we want.
-That's what we need.

31:48.042 --> 31:50.792
Whew.

31:50.792 --> 31:51.876
-Hey.
-Hi.

31:51.876 --> 31:53.375
-Nobody's awake.
-Okay.

31:53.375 --> 31:54.959
The table's set.

31:54.959 --> 31:57.584
[snoring]

31:57.584 --> 31:58.792
Morning, how's it going?

31:58.792 --> 31:59.584
All right.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.000
-Morning, Marcos.
-Good morning.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.250
Brunch is ready.

32:02.250 --> 32:05.667
What time did you get up?

32:05.667 --> 32:07.334
But now I can focus
on their dinner.

32:07.334 --> 32:14.167
But you're gonna lack focus if
your mind isn't there.

32:14.167 --> 32:15.667
Oh, whatever.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.667
No, I think I sleep four hours,
I don't know.

32:17.667 --> 32:22.667
It's gonna be a long day, but I
have to man up and keep going.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.167
Oh, okay.

32:24.167 --> 32:25.334
Any news on
the new stewardess?

32:25.334 --> 32:26.876
Yeah, there's progress, yeah.

32:26.876 --> 32:29.959
Days like yesterday, I can
do it for two days, but...

32:29.959 --> 32:31.250
Yeah, exactly..

32:31.250 --> 32:32.667
It should work out
for the next charter.

32:32.667 --> 32:33.501
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:33.501 --> 32:41.292
Well, that's good news.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.959
-Should we set this Tiwal up?
-Yeah.

32:42.959 --> 32:44.876
The only problem with
them getting up late

32:44.876 --> 32:52.584
is this sets us up
for another late night.

32:52.584 --> 32:53.375
[sneezes]

32:53.375 --> 32:54.667
Good morning!

32:54.667 --> 32:56.000
-Oh, my God!
-Look at this slut...

32:56.000 --> 32:57.375
you're looking fire.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.959
Would anyone like a Bloody Mary?

32:58.959 --> 33:00.584
-Bring a round of 'em.
-Okay, great.

33:00.584 --> 33:02.209
Marcos, we are ready to go.

33:02.209 --> 33:06.709
Copy for Marquito.

33:06.709 --> 33:09.209
Oh, the Bloody Marys are here.

33:09.209 --> 33:10.375
Thanks, Colin.

33:10.375 --> 33:11.751
-Good morning.
-Hey, morning.

33:11.751 --> 33:13.334
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

33:13.334 --> 33:15.250
Let's get that other
Tiwal in the water

33:15.250 --> 33:16.959
for after these
guys finish lunch.

33:16.959 --> 33:21.542
Yep.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.167
-So good, that one's...
-Oh, this is amazing.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.501
Baby, this is so good,
did you try this?

33:24.501 --> 33:36.876
-Really good.
-They're all amazing.

33:36.876 --> 33:39.167
Let's go,
what you've done so far?

33:39.167 --> 33:41.709
-Put the baton in?
-Yeah.

33:41.709 --> 33:43.959
You're a sailor girl,
aren't you? Come on!

33:43.959 --> 33:47.209
I don't know what the [bleep]'s
going on right now with Kelsie.

33:47.209 --> 33:48.209
She's a bit slow.

33:48.209 --> 33:49.417
Ow, ow, ow.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.584
That hamster's on that wheel,

33:51.584 --> 33:53.667
but not running very fast,
I can tell you.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.167
Do you want me to tie you off?

33:55.167 --> 33:57.959
-No.
-Okay.

33:57.959 --> 34:00.292
Please, give me five minutes,
I just need to pee.

34:00.292 --> 34:01.167
You need help?

34:01.167 --> 34:02.667
No, I don't need help,

34:02.667 --> 34:11.167
I just need two minutes to
take a ----ing piss.

34:11.167 --> 34:13.250
I wanna see Pedro water-surf.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.584
Ah!

34:14.584 --> 34:15.709
Baby, will you go on
that boat with me?

34:15.709 --> 34:17.250
No, I'll go with him, not you.

34:17.250 --> 34:26.042
Yeah, I just don't trust
your abilities.

34:26.042 --> 34:31.626
On that.

34:31.626 --> 34:34.626
-You wanna use the Seabob?
-Yeah.

34:34.626 --> 34:37.167
[shouts]

34:37.167 --> 34:40.375
Be careful!

34:40.375 --> 34:41.959
Dude, that must be awesome.

34:41.959 --> 34:48.709
Yeah, baby.

34:48.709 --> 34:51.834
Switch, switch, switch.
Switch!

34:51.834 --> 34:53.626
[laughing]

34:53.626 --> 34:55.083
Cruisin' out there.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.959
Tonight for dinner,
gonna do miso soup, tuna tataki,

34:57.959 --> 35:00.959
sashimi rolls, and then chicken
teriyaki, rice noodles...

35:00.959 --> 35:02.000
that's enough, right?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.542
Yeah, [bleep] me.

35:03.542 --> 35:06.375
These type of guests,
they just wanna feel rich.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.876
Japanese food is...

35:07.876 --> 35:09.709
it's very elegant anywhere
in the world.

35:09.709 --> 35:15.167
Everything has to be clean,
nice cuts, nice presentation.

35:15.167 --> 35:16.542
It's art.

35:16.542 --> 35:17.876
Is it gonna be
family-style, or...

35:17.876 --> 35:18.959
Yeah, you have to.

35:18.959 --> 35:22.083
-There'll be so much sh--.
-Yeah. That's fine.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.375
Enough water sports for the day?

35:23.375 --> 35:24.751
-Hey, Kels?
-Yeah?

35:24.751 --> 35:27.459
If we can try, let's try
having a bit more

35:27.459 --> 35:28.751
urgency in things that we do.

35:28.751 --> 35:29.709
Okay.

35:29.709 --> 35:31.792
I'm not asking you to run
and do things,

35:31.792 --> 35:34.292
but let's try and make them
a bit snappier, if possible.

35:34.292 --> 35:35.459
Sounds good.

35:35.459 --> 35:37.334
I don't think I'm moving slow.

35:37.334 --> 35:40.292
I think Gary's style,
it's just fast and frazzled.

35:40.292 --> 35:42.167
Just uh, uh, uh everywhere.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.751
Don't run and don't hurt
yourself and don't rush things.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.751
Kelsie 2.0, fast and frazzled,
coming at you live.

35:48.751 --> 35:49.667
[laughs]

35:49.667 --> 35:51.167
-Yeah?
-Sounds good.

35:51.167 --> 35:54.125
Yeah?

35:54.125 --> 35:56.292
Hey, Daisy!

35:56.292 --> 35:59.584
Someone call me?

35:59.584 --> 36:02.959
Okay, of course,
coming right up.

36:02.959 --> 36:03.959
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

36:03.959 --> 36:13.751
Hey, Kels?

36:13.751 --> 36:17.542
Daisy!

36:17.542 --> 36:22.542
I'll lift it up and
put it on the platform.

36:22.542 --> 36:24.876
He said to put the pin out
and get the whole thing?

36:24.876 --> 36:35.209
Yeah.

36:35.209 --> 36:37.626
-You guys have grapes?
-Yeah.

36:37.626 --> 36:40.501
You could, like, blend them up
or throw them in a juicer

36:40.501 --> 36:42.083
or something, you can
make my Transfusion.

36:42.083 --> 36:47.501
It's equal parts ginger ale,
grape juice, and vodka.

36:47.501 --> 36:52.250
I want nothing more than to tell
Chris to go [bleep] himself.

36:52.250 --> 36:53.918
These people have
no respect for me.

36:53.918 --> 36:58.167
I am emotionally, mentally,
and physically drained.

36:58.167 --> 37:00.375
----ing joke.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.417
-Gary, I have bad news.
-What?

37:02.417 --> 37:04.083
I did everything you said,
I've been hurrying,

37:04.083 --> 37:07.167
I was doing it all in one piece,
and just the pin fell.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.417
Where did you drop the pin?

37:08.417 --> 37:09.959
It bloop-bloop.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.542
Did I not ask you to put
the thing on the swim platform

37:12.542 --> 37:17.292
so we cannot drop
it in the water?

37:17.292 --> 37:18.751
Coming up...

37:18.751 --> 37:21.959
Are you still on for dinner
in about 10 minutes?

37:21.959 --> 37:23.250
11:00?

37:23.250 --> 37:24.584
[bleep] my life.

37:24.584 --> 37:29.209
I literally might throw
someone overboard.

37:29.209 --> 37:33.918
God.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.375
Yeah, I need to juice grapes.
----ing moron.

37:38.375 --> 37:41.834
I'm ----ing fuming over this.

37:41.834 --> 37:43.626
Put them in the blender and
run it through a sieve.

37:43.626 --> 37:47.417
You seriously think if I
blend these and I can make...

37:47.417 --> 37:49.250
-I think it'll work.
-Yeah, I did it before.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.959
It's a ridiculous
----ing request.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.876
What's going on, dude?

37:53.876 --> 37:57.792
What happened?
What's that?

37:57.792 --> 38:08.959
I mean, it's stupid to make
water toy components that sink.

38:08.959 --> 38:10.792
It's like a rite of
passage at this point.

38:10.792 --> 38:14.501
Yeah, exactly.

38:14.501 --> 38:15.959
I was like [bleep] me.

38:15.959 --> 38:17.250
Oops.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.792
Oh, gosh, today is not my day.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.709
Anything you want me
to do before I go down?

38:20.709 --> 38:23.125
No, you can pretty much
go down now, if you want.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.375
[sighs]

38:24.375 --> 38:25.751
Thanks, Kels.

38:25.751 --> 38:28.042
Blend first, and then
add sugar and water?

38:28.042 --> 38:29.209
Everything, everything together.

38:29.209 --> 38:34.042
Let me help you.

38:34.042 --> 38:35.876
Grape juice...

38:35.876 --> 38:39.375
Grape juice is literally,
like, just processed sugar.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.709
I can't...
I hate my life.

38:41.709 --> 38:46.959
If it tastes like
water, sugary water?

38:46.959 --> 38:49.042
Oh, my God.

38:49.042 --> 38:50.584
This drink is so good.

38:50.584 --> 38:56.501
Just say the grapes
from Europe are very sweet.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.417
Here, that's for Chris,
that's for Dino.

38:58.417 --> 39:00.417
Thank you so much,
you make a wonderful stew.

39:00.417 --> 39:01.417
I just wanna know which one.

39:01.417 --> 39:04.250
Oh, amazing.

39:04.250 --> 39:05.375
Are you Daisy?

39:05.375 --> 39:06.459
I could be, if you want.

39:06.459 --> 39:08.000
Ha, I'll be anything you want.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.417
Yeah, so...

39:09.417 --> 39:10.417
-All right, Chris, let's see...
-Look at this.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.667
...with the muddled grapes.

39:11.667 --> 39:12.918
-You did it.
-Let's see, baby.

39:12.918 --> 39:13.792
Transfusion. Woo!

39:13.792 --> 39:15.584
Which one's better,
taste this one.

39:15.584 --> 39:17.417
-Good job?
-Great job!

39:17.417 --> 39:19.792
Excellent work!

39:19.792 --> 39:23.375
[bleep] me.

39:23.375 --> 39:24.959
Delicious Transfusion.

39:24.959 --> 39:28.918
Two more of these and
a margarita with salt.

39:28.918 --> 39:31.667
I'm gonna be a deckhand on
my next job.

39:31.667 --> 39:36.375
[bleep].

39:36.375 --> 39:39.250
I just wanted to confirm
timing for dinner

39:39.250 --> 39:41.792
this evening with Marcos.

39:41.792 --> 39:49.375
Yeah, okay, great.

39:49.375 --> 39:52.334
Yes, sir.

39:52.334 --> 39:53.584
No, maybe she claims rank.

39:53.584 --> 39:55.209
She can suck my dick.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.792
-Eh?
-Bye-bye.

39:56.792 --> 40:02.375
And as soon as she comes,
I'm gonna say, hey...

40:02.375 --> 40:04.959
[laughing]

40:04.959 --> 40:06.584
What are you laughing at?

40:06.584 --> 40:09.375
-[shouting]
-Woo!

40:09.375 --> 40:11.000
They have a ----ing
deejay, honey.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.709
Woohoohoo!

40:13.709 --> 40:15.959
-Okay, dinner at 10:00.
-Okay.

40:15.959 --> 40:18.167
I feel like your face
is saying something

40:18.167 --> 40:19.250
different to your mouth.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.709
No, no, no worries, I got it.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.167
Just thinking what
I'm gonna cook.

40:22.167 --> 40:23.501
Okay.

40:23.501 --> 40:24.542
I gotta take a little
nappy-nappies.

40:24.542 --> 40:25.959
Dude, the hot tub is so hot!

40:25.959 --> 40:32.250
I'm going in, Chris.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.792
-Oh, thanks for doing that.
-No problem.

40:34.792 --> 40:36.334
What you could do is
squeeze all our limes

40:36.334 --> 40:37.751
for margaritas tomorrow.

40:37.751 --> 40:39.667
You will make your
chief stew very happy.

40:39.667 --> 40:41.209
I could make you very happy
if that's what you'd like.

40:41.209 --> 40:42.584
Yes.

40:42.584 --> 40:43.876
I reckon that if I go on
the wrong side of her,

40:43.876 --> 40:45.083
she's gonna have me
for breakfast.

40:45.083 --> 40:46.542
This is the juicer.

40:46.542 --> 40:47.834
You can move it over there
or you can do it here,

40:47.834 --> 40:48.834
I don't mind.

40:48.834 --> 40:50.959
I'm like, cautious.

40:50.959 --> 40:52.584
But I know what I'm doing...

40:52.584 --> 40:55.459
look after Daisy, and
then she'll look after me.

40:55.459 --> 40:57.584
Thank you, I really
appreciate that.

40:57.584 --> 41:01.792
That's no worries.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.417
Why don't you just go lie down
for 20 minutes, go to sleep?

41:04.417 --> 41:06.167
No, no, no, Japanese,

41:06.167 --> 41:09.501
it's just a lot of ----ing
little tiny sh--.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.250
Trust me, I rest later.

41:11.250 --> 41:17.792
Oof.

41:17.792 --> 41:19.459
-Knowing these guests...
-Yes.

41:19.459 --> 41:26.667
how do you think
the tip's gonna be?

41:26.667 --> 41:27.501
Oh, really?

41:27.501 --> 41:29.167
Why, what do you...

41:29.167 --> 41:30.542
Can you guys go into a cabin
if you're gonna kiss like that?

41:30.542 --> 41:32.375
You're making me blush.

41:32.375 --> 41:33.918
----ing hell.

41:33.918 --> 41:34.918
What's the matter?

41:34.918 --> 41:36.250
She said she wants kids.

41:36.250 --> 41:38.042
Don't know if
I'm ready for that.

41:38.042 --> 41:39.167
[laughing]

41:39.167 --> 41:40.667
Hi.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.375
I just wanted to check
that you're still on

41:42.375 --> 41:45.250
for dinner in about 10 minutes?

41:45.250 --> 41:47.042
11:00?

41:47.042 --> 41:49.584
This one was a lot of cooking,
this whole charter.

41:49.584 --> 41:53.834
-Today as well?
-[bleep] yeah.

41:53.834 --> 41:56.375
So, 11:15.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.250
So, an hour?

41:58.250 --> 41:59.709
[bleep] my life.

41:59.709 --> 42:01.918
These inconsiderate guests
are making it

42:01.918 --> 42:07.292
literally impossible for
any of us to go to sleep.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.751
Okay. Okay.

42:08.751 --> 42:11.584
If tonight is a repeat
of last night,

42:11.584 --> 42:15.876
I literally might throw
someone overboard.

42:15.876 --> 42:16.751
God.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.250
I just want to finish
and go to sleep.

42:19.250 --> 42:22.375
We're gonna be here all night.

42:22.375 --> 42:23.876
Next, on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht."

42:23.876 --> 42:26.542
We're lucky to have a
new addition to our team.

42:26.542 --> 42:28.709
Let's get ready to
welcome her with open arms.

42:28.709 --> 42:30.959
-This is Scarlett.
-Hey, Scarlett.

42:30.959 --> 42:33.209
Nice to meet you.
Oh sh--, here's trouble.

42:33.209 --> 42:35.501
Have you given any thought
into second stew?

42:35.501 --> 42:37.542
It's not about bossing
each other around.

42:37.542 --> 42:40.876
Get this hierarchy
out of your head.

42:40.876 --> 42:42.918
Okay, he was looking after me,
I can't rely on you.

42:42.918 --> 42:45.167
Because last time you were
looking after me, I kissed Gary.

42:45.167 --> 42:47.083
You kiss Gary every
----ing night.

42:47.083 --> 42:49.250
All right, jealousy over
in the corner.

42:49.250 --> 42:50.667
I'd like to have a Sapporo beer.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.542
I don't think we have
any Japanese beer.

42:52.542 --> 42:54.042
Ash, do you got a Japanese beer?

42:54.042 --> 42:55.667
We'll take six Sapporo.

42:55.667 --> 42:59.667
I'm going to ----ing punch that
----ing mother----er.
