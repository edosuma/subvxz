all of the fans

00:06.172 --> 00:08.675

in one of the most intense

00:08.758 --> 00:11.928
and strategic battles
this competition has ever seen,

00:12.011 --> 00:15.390
and it all comes down to this
exciting conclusion tonight.

00:15.473 --> 00:19.644
And as you can see, the crowd

00:19.728 --> 00:21.062
Am I right?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.648
[cheers and applause]

00:23.732 --> 00:25.024
All right, guys, right now,
for the first time ever,

00:25.108 --> 00:29.195
three finalists--
Chris, Matt, and Kruseman--

00:29.279 --> 00:32.115
are in the middle of their
final tattoo of the season,

00:32.198 --> 00:35.952
tattooing live in the style
that you assigned.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.872

<i>male announcer:</i>
<i>This season on "Ink Master,"</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:55.263
<i>18 masters and apprentices</i>
<i>were battling it out</i>

00:55.346 --> 00:58.308
<i>to prove they're the best...</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:00.226
- Historically, the art of
tattooing has been passed down

01:00.310 --> 01:04.313
by masters teaching apprentices
everything they know.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.316
<i>- The master-apprentice</i>
<i>relationship</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:08.193
is a very sacred thing.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.820
<i>announcer: Hoping to settle</i>
<i>the age-old question...</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:12.238
- You want to beat the person
who taught you.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.364
<i>You want to take everything</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:14.616
that they've taught you
and surpass them.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.161
<i>announcer: Can the apprentice</i>
<i>ever surpass the master?</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:19.245
- Grab your popcorn,
gather around.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.373
- The only person that could
beat you will be me.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.334
<i>announcer:</i>
<i>Bonds were tested...</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:26.544
- But [bleep], man!
We have an advantage, dude!

01:26.628 --> 01:28.463
- Dave [bleep] me royally.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.756
- The last thing I'm gonna do
is roll over on Duffy.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.383
- I don't think you have
a choice.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.511
<i>announcer: And loyalties</i>
<i>were betrayed...</i>

01:34.594 --> 01:35.428
- I was trying to save you
from yourself.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.388
- You don't think it was
[bleep] sabotage?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.057
- Did your brain fall out
of your ass[bleep]?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.141
- Chris and I have a plan.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.268
{\an3}- Do you think he really
has your back?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.353
<i>- I'm not gonna take somebody</i>
<i>calling me</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:44.813
a two-faced [bleep] liar.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.147
{\an3}- You're campaigning to these
people to do your bidding,

01:46.231 --> 01:48.191
{\an3}to work your personal way
to the top!

01:48.274 --> 01:51.694
<i>announcer: Pushing the artists</i>
<i>to the limit...</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:52.612
- I don't know.
It's up to you.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.572
- I can't gold leaf
over any wet paint.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.866
Matt doesn't listen and he's not
a good team player.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.036
<i>announcer: And raising the bar</i>
<i>with the best artwork</i>

02:00.119 --> 02:03.164
<i>this competition has ever seen.</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:06.376
<i>One by one,</i>
<i>they were eliminated.</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:09.503
- Nobody is tattooing smart.
- I'ma say that's bull[bleep].

02:09.586 --> 02:11.548
- You say it's detailed
but it's hard to tell

02:11.631 --> 02:12.715
what the [bleep] is going on!

02:12.799 --> 02:14.384
- Y'all like beating
a dead horse, man.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
- Do you want to go home, man?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.386
- I would have never
[bleep] done this.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.929
- You should get
the [bleep] out of here.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.014
Kick rocks.

02:50.628 --> 02:55.008
<i>tattooing live onstage</i>
<i>for America's vote.</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:56.801
<i>- I know that I'm</i>
<i>the best artist ever</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:58.595

03:18.364 --> 03:20.909
- This is
the "Ink Master" finale,

03:20.992 --> 03:23.786
coming to you live
from New York City.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.457
And as always, I'm joined
by Oliver Peck and Chris Nuñez.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.208
What's up, fellas?
- What's up, bud?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.710
- Yeah!
[cheers and applause]

03:30.793 --> 03:32.879
- There they are.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.881
Ollie, gotta ask you, man.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.342
This season,
masters and apprentices.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.345
Do you think that affected
the overall competition?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.138
{\an8}- I think these artists
coming in here,

03:42.221 --> 03:44.807
{\an8}to start off this competition
already having somebody

03:44.891 --> 03:47.226
that they have a strong bond
with as a teammate

03:47.310 --> 03:50.188
really started this competition
off fierce and gave everybody

03:50.271 --> 03:52.065
a lot of advantages,
but then, in the end,

03:52.148 --> 03:55.234
you had to turn and go against
your potential friend or partner

03:55.318 --> 03:57.695
that you came here with...
- It's tough, man.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.697
- And it made it for
a lot stressful environment

03:59.781 --> 04:02.241
in this season.
- Chris, how about you, man?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.868
How do you feel about
the overall level of artwork

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
that you saw this season?

04:05.453 --> 04:08.498
{\an8}- Well, I think the level
raises itself, but really,

04:08.581 --> 04:10.959
{\an8}it's this--this look
at the master and apprentice.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.460
{\an8}It's the best thing
that can ever be given down

04:12.543 --> 04:15.004
if you're the apprentice,
so there's a level of respect

04:15.088 --> 04:17.048
that has to be commanded
amongst the two,

04:17.130 --> 04:19.591
and then they gotta battle
it out.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.344
It's tough.
- It is tough.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.179
All right, guys, well,
you heard that.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.098
The bar has been raised.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.265
{\an8}But right now,
for the first time ever,

04:26.349 --> 04:29.936
{\an8}the three finalists
are tattooing live,

04:30.019 --> 04:33.481
and tonight, you will vote
one of them into the top two.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.193
Now they started tattooing
about 5 1/2 hours ago,

04:37.276 --> 04:41.197
and they're down
to just about 30 minutes.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.033
Now last week, we asked you
to assign the style

04:44.117 --> 04:46.995
each finalist must nail
to earn the title of Ink Master.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.206
And all week long, you voted.

04:50.289 --> 04:51.833
Let's find out what you chose.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.043
Let's check in with Chris first.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.045
My man.
- Hey, Dave.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.547
- Mr. Blinston!
[cheers and applause]

04:57.630 --> 04:58.631
- Whoo!
- There he is.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.467
both: What's happening?
[mix of cheers and boos]

05:01.551 --> 05:03.720
- How are you?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.513
{\an3}Wow.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.723
- Half and half.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.560
{\an3}- Mixed reviews, buddy.
Mixed reviews.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.811
{\an3}All right, all right.
Let the man speak.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.230
Let the man speak.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.567
{\an3}So, Chris, what did America
assign you?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.402
{\an7}- Uh, America assigned me
color realism,

05:19.485 --> 05:20.903
{\an7}which is kind of my boat,
so...

05:20.987 --> 05:21.779
{\an8}- That is right up your alley.
- Yeah.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
{\an1}I'm sitting pretty comfortable
with it.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.159
{\an3}- Now did you campaign
to get assigned color realism?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.870
{\an1}- I did, I threw out a few
social medias asking for it,

05:28.953 --> 05:29.746
{\an1}but I would have taken anything,
you know?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.914
{\an1}I won enough challenges
that I showed

05:31.998 --> 05:33.458
{\an1}that I can do
just about everything.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.084
{\an3}- How is it tattooing live
on television

05:35.168 --> 05:37.628
{\an3}and in front
of a huge studio audience?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.630
- Yeah, yeah, this is crazy.
- Especially an audience that--

05:39.714 --> 05:41.507
- This is wild right here,
for real, yeah.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.426
[cheers and applause]
- Especially an audience

05:43.509 --> 05:45.178
that gave you
that kind of a reception.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.637
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's gotta be intense.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.555
{\an1}- It is.
It's super intense.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.474
I'm happy to be here.
- Right on, man.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.018
Looking good. Thank you so much
for being here.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.312
All right, guys, right now,
it is time to check in

05:54.395 --> 05:58.649
with one of our very best,
one of the top three.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.317
{\an3}Mr. Matt, how are you,
buddy?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.194
- Good, Dave.
How are you?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.737
- Let me come over there.
[cheers and applause]

06:02.820 --> 06:04.113
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.615
[mix of cheers and boos]

06:05.698 --> 06:07.950
Look at this!

06:08.034 --> 06:11.454
{\an3}I mean, if this isn't
a divided crowd tonight...

06:11.537 --> 06:13.664
- No kidding.
- Very divided crowd tonight.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.083
{\an3}Now, Matt, what style
did America assign to you?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.794
{\an7}- We got color realism
as well.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.962
{\an9}- Color realism.
Head-to-head color realism.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.631
- Yeah.
- Now did you also campaign?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.008
{\an1}- I didn't campaign real hard
for color realism.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.134
{\an1}I didn't honestly care
what I got.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.303
{\an1}I'm--I'm versatile and I wanted
to able to show that.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.305
{\an1}I'm glad I got
color real--realism

06:29.388 --> 06:31.682
{\an1}so I could show
something brand-new.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.643
{\an3}- Right on, man.
And how are you holding up?

06:33.726 --> 06:36.395
- Uh, like a rock, you know?
- Yeah, you are.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.105
All right, buddy.
- She's doing great.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.233
- All right.
There he is.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.818
About 30 minutes to go.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.944
[crowd chanting "Kruseman"]

06:43.027 --> 06:45.988
And here--you guys want
to check in with Kruseman?

06:46.072 --> 06:46.864
[crowd continues chanting
"Kruseman"]

06:46.948 --> 06:48.574
Yeah?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.993
Kruseman, what is up, buddy?

06:51.077 --> 06:51.911
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How are you?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.746
- Good to see you.
- Glad to see you.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.373
How are you?

06:55.456 --> 06:56.374
[cheers and applause]

06:56.457 --> 07:00.294
{\an3}Kruseman, that's gotta
feel good, right?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.630
- That feels awesome. Yup.
- That's a lot of support.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.257
{\an8}- That's my family
and all my homies,

07:04.340 --> 07:06.134
{\an8}and I'm so stoked
that they're here.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.053
{\an8}- Right on, so...
so let me ask you.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.597
{\an3}What did America
assign to you?

07:11.681 --> 07:14.976
{\an1}- Uh, thankfully,
they chose American traditional

07:15.059 --> 07:16.227
{\an1}because that's what I do,
so I'm pretty stoked on that.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.354
- Gotta be stoked.
- Yup.

07:18.437 --> 07:19.480
{\an3}- That is right up your
wheelhouse.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.023
{\an1}- Absolutely.
It gives me a good chance

07:21.107 --> 07:22.733
{\an1}to showcase my style
of tattooing,

07:22.817 --> 07:23.901
so I couldn't be happier.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.361
{\an3}- This is crazy
because America is gonna put

07:25.444 --> 07:28.573
one of you guys
in the top two.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.365
Good luck to you, buddy.
- Thank you.

07:29.448 --> 07:32.160
- And thank you for being here.

07:32.243 --> 07:36.414
All right, America...

07:36.497 --> 07:39.041
their fate is in your hands.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.169
It's time to open the voting

07:51.888 --> 07:54.307

07:56.225 --> 07:59.937

in the top two.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.066
Now the finalists have only
about 25 minutes left to tattoo,

08:04.150 --> 08:07.737
then our evil panel of judges
will critique their work

08:07.820 --> 08:11.657
and voting will close,
so get those votes in now.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.076
Now what the finalists
don't know

08:14.160 --> 08:16.579
is that the winner
of America's vote

08:16.662 --> 08:19.665
will also get $10,000.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.542
- Whoa!
- Right?

08:21.626 --> 08:22.919
[cheers and applause]

10:06.731 --> 10:08.524
- It's really good to see you.
- Hi.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.859
- You guys feeling good?
all: Yeah.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.362
- I know there was a lot
of controversy this season,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.364
so we gotta get into that.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.699
Some of these
master and apprentice pairs

10:16.782 --> 10:19.910
really didn't work out together
so well as it turns out.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.121
- As it turns out.
- Did you notice that?

10:22.204 --> 10:26.125
Ryan, you seemed to blame
your failures on your master.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.378
What's up with that, man?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.421
{\an8}- St. Marq steered me
in the wrong direction,

10:30.504 --> 10:33.257
{\an8}made me question
my own decisions,

10:33.341 --> 10:36.385
and I took advice from someone
that's not as good as me.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.261
- You took advice
from the tattoo god.

- Mark, what do you got
to say to that, man?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.900
{\an1}- Well, I mean, Ryan is--
he's a comedian,

10:50.983 --> 10:53.694
and he should really take up
a career in stand-up comedy.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.863
{\an7}And, you know, really, if he
would have just shut his mouth

10:55.946 --> 10:56.906
{\an8}and been a good apprentice,

10:56.989 --> 10:58.449
{\an1}he probably would have lasted
a lot longer.

- Whoa!

11:02.828 --> 11:06.082

On the seventh day...

11:06.165 --> 11:08.209
God packed his machines

11:08.292 --> 11:09.752
Am I right?
- Aah!

11:09.835 --> 11:12.254
- Chris, let me ask you this.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.173
Do you think it hurt these guys
that in the long run,

11:14.256 --> 11:16.384
they couldn't get together?
- Well, I think--look.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.594
{\an3}Again, if you pay the respect
to your master,

11:18.677 --> 11:20.638
{\an9}then you're always gonna
come out better.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.598
{\an9}You're gonna stand strong,
you're gonna stand together,

11:22.681 --> 11:24.266
{\an9}and it's really the virtue
of tattooing.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.978
{\an3}It's what we all come from,
so holding tight shows respect

11:28.062 --> 11:28.813
{\an3}and it shows reverence
for the art,

11:28.896 --> 11:30.773
{\an3}and that's where you need
to be.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.109
- Fair enough, man.
Thank you.

You're the big winner tonight.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.768
So, Marisa, let me ask you this.
- Yeah.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.521
- Did that distract you
or was that helpful?

12:10.604 --> 12:12.982
How was that for you?
- Oh, it wasn't distracting.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.692
{\an1}Um, it wasn't, like,
great timing,

12:14.775 --> 12:16.068
{\an7}but we really didn't
have control over that.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.697
{\an8}Um, we both helped each other
out and had each other's back

12:19.780 --> 12:21.657
{\an1}the whole competition,
and he's super supportive,

12:21.740 --> 12:24.493
{\an1}and he's not too hard
on the eyes, so...

12:24.577 --> 12:26.454
- Aww.
[crowd awws]

12:26.537 --> 12:28.414
Very, very nice.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.999
You know, Duffy and Kru--
- This is between you two.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.126
- Say again?
- You just didn't try very hard.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.087
- I don't--I--
I don't concur with that.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.673
[laughter]

12:37.756 --> 12:39.550
I had nothing to do
with this, lady.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.593
That was Ryan that said that.
- But we can all agree that...

12:40.676 --> 12:41.844
{\an1}- No, he took my girl
right here.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.012
- One of you is easy
on the eyes, right?

12:43.095 --> 12:44.513
- Mine.
- Let's move it along.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.682
Duffy and Kruseman had a very
supportive working relationship,

12:46.765 --> 12:49.351
and both went really,
really far.

12:49.435 --> 12:55.441
[cheers and applause]

12:55.524 --> 12:58.194
There is a lot of controversy
about our final three.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.196
Duffy, do you think
that Kruseman deserves

13:00.279 --> 13:01.280
to be in the finale?

13:01.363 --> 13:03.532
{\an8}- I totally think he deserves
to be here.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.867
{\an8}I don't doubt it for a second,
and people who think

13:04.950 --> 13:06.911
{\an8}he got a free pass,
it's absolutely ridiculous.

13:06.994 --> 13:11.707
- And it doesn't sting that he
essentially edged you out?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.459
- I'm proud of him.
- Good for you, man.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.376
- Yeah.
- That's awesome. Thank you.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.379
[cheers and applause]

13:17.463 --> 13:20.841
But you know I had your back.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.052
I had your back.
- I love you for it.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.054
- Big Ceeze.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.972

What are your thoughts
on the whole Kruseman thing?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.144

I think, uh...

13:32.228 --> 13:34.355
{\an8}[laughter]

13:34.438 --> 13:35.731
I think Kruseman
shouldn't be up there.

I think Craig
should be up there.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.567

Craig always went out

13:47.952 --> 13:49.745
of the box, you know?

13:49.828 --> 13:52.748
{\an3}Kruseman just kept it,
you know, safe and simple,

13:52.831 --> 13:54.458
and sometimes didn't even do...

13:54.542 --> 13:56.085
- The challenge.
- Uh, you know, the challenge.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.670
- There's no doubt that there's
a lot of love

13:57.753 --> 13:59.588
for Craig in this room,
for sure.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.173
But let me--let me throw it to--

14:01.257 --> 14:04.051
let me throw it to Dave
up there.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.263
I mean, Kruseman, how do you
respond to that, buddy?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.973
- Big Ceeze?
Who's Big Ceeze?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.766
Was he even in this competition?

14:10.849 --> 14:15.521
- Oh! Oh!
[crowd oohs]

14:15.604 --> 14:16.939
- Wait, hold on.
The only reason why

14:17.022 --> 14:20.276
he doesn't know who I am
is because I do real tattoos.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.112
- Oh!
[crowd oohs]

14:23.195 --> 14:24.530
[scattered boos]

14:24.613 --> 14:26.073

14:26.156 --> 14:27.575
I do have to point out
he is up there.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.909
- He is up there,
but that doesn't mean anything

14:28.993 --> 14:31.579
because a lot of sick artists
went home, so...

14:31.662 --> 14:32.830
- Dave fought just as much
the rest of us,

14:32.913 --> 14:36.375
and he did good,
solid tattoos the entire time,

14:36.458 --> 14:38.961
and it was up to you guys, and
you decided to keep him, so...

14:39.044 --> 14:41.839
- Well, let's talk about this
because a lot of people

14:41.922 --> 14:44.300
used the word "safe"
when it came to Kruseman.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.886
Oliver, what are your thoughts
on Kruseman's...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.471
Safe Sally attitude?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.515
- I think--I think definitely
Kruseman started off

14:51.599 --> 14:53.142
the competition
as a nonconformist.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.810
{\an8}He didn't want to meet
the challenges.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.020
{\an8}But then when it came down
that he almost went home,

14:56.103 --> 14:59.648
he turned a new page and really
started hitting it hard,

14:59.732 --> 15:00.649
and he finished up
the competition

15:00.733 --> 15:03.485
as strong as anybody else.

15:03.569 --> 15:08.490
- Yeah.

that Katie wasn't good enough

and respect for Katie.

I had her back the whole time.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
I sat around and listened
the first few weeks

15:56.538 --> 15:58.207
and kind of took everybody's
strategy in.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.708
I knew that some
of the relationships

15:59.792 --> 16:01.085
weren't as strong as they are,

16:01.168 --> 16:02.711
and I threw that back
at them later.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.047

to be the quiet guy

18:22.267 --> 18:24.770
Tweet now, guys.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.396
All right, this season,

18:26.480 --> 18:29.483
there was more strategy play
than ever before.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.986
Alliances formed and the
competition became cutthroat.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.405
Let's take a look.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.826
- Seems like we got a lot
of people coming here to compete

18:38.909 --> 18:39.952
against people
they're close with.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.203
It's gonna get rough
when it starts getting heated.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.790
{\an8}- First time I came
into this competition,

18:44.873 --> 18:46.959
<i>I played a very fair,</i>
<i>friendly game.</i>

18:47.042 --> 18:49.169
I left that [bleep] at home.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.630
- You guys look sneaky.
- We are sneaky.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.257
This is chess, not checkers.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.677
{\an8}- Am I crazy? Does anybody else
know this is a game?

18:56.760 --> 18:57.845
- You were trying
to play the game

18:57.928 --> 18:58.971
{\an3}by going up against
weaker artists.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.890
- Really, against anybody
in this house, is it safe?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.143
- Do you guys want to send me
down and take a chance

19:04.226 --> 19:06.895
of burning St. Marq
and sending him home?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.146
{\an3}- You're gonna go battle
St. Marq out?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.606
Of course you're gonna
[bleep] beat his ass,

19:09.690 --> 19:10.899
{\an3}you know what I mean,
but there's still that risk,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.317
{\an3}'cause you can
get sent home too.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.402
- I'd like to represent myself

19:13.485 --> 19:15.070
on behalf of this team,
with honor.

19:15.153 --> 19:18.198
- May the best man win.
- Bring it on, big man.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.950
<i>- Who the [bleep]</i>
<i>do I feel sorry for here?</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:22.578
{\an8}Nobody.
I don't give a damn.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.163
Send one of 'em home.
Let's get this over with.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.331
{\an1}- Every decision I make
is strategic.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.834
{\an1}I took out St. Marq for myself,
not for my team.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.878
- The sheep feel that they have
a shepherd,

19:30.961 --> 19:32.129
but the shepherd's gonna get
ready

19:32.212 --> 19:33.922
for some lamb sandwich.
- Exactly.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.007
<i>- Chris has all of these guys</i>

19:35.090 --> 19:36.967
{\an8}on strings
like little marionettes.

19:37.050 --> 19:37.968
{\an3}- I think they have
a good strategy.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.636
{\an1}- Sounds like you have
a plan here.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.096
{\an3}<i>- You're campaigning to these</i>
<i>people to do your bidding,</i>

19:41.179 --> 19:44.057

personal way to the top!

19:59.364 --> 19:59.948
Good to see you, buddy.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.158
Now, Craig, you came in

20:01.241 --> 20:04.119
with a kind of a cutthroat
strategy from you.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.914
- Yeah, my--
- Didn't really pan out, did it?

20:06.997 --> 20:08.749
- My cutthroat strategy
didn't really start

20:08.832 --> 20:10.709
until Miami got taken out
of the house.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.169
I really took it personal.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.253
- Yeah.
- Kind of went for blood

20:13.337 --> 20:14.963
and just wanted everybody else
for it.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.548
{\an8}- Yeah, that was tough for you.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.633
{\an8}There were a lot of alliances
this season.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.927
{\an8}I'm curious to see where
everyone stands right now.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.179
{\an8}So let me get a show of hands.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.848
{\an8}Who thinks that Matt deserves
to win?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.350

20:26.433 --> 20:26.934
Wow!

20:27.017 --> 20:30.604

20:30.687 --> 20:32.648
All right.
Let me ask.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.483

20:34.566 --> 20:40.072

20:40.155 --> 20:40.864

Hold up. Let me ask--
let me ask St. Marq this.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.634
Mark, Chris took you out
of the competition

21:00.717 --> 21:03.345
in one of the most controversial
eliminations of all time.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.222
You want to give him the win?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.474
- Man, I'm--I'm 100% Team Chris.
- Boo!

21:07.557 --> 21:09.977
{\an8}- The only guy up there that
deserves this crown is Chris.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.353
{\an8}What do you think?

21:11.436 --> 21:16.608
[mix of cheers and boos]

21:17.609 --> 21:20.362
- How did it feel getting
taken out by Chris?

21:20.445 --> 21:22.364
- I mean, Chris, he saw a shot,
he took it.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.865
I mean, one of us
was gonna go home.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.492
One of us was gonna be up there.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.119
I mean, his strategy
was kick-ass.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.870
He went after the top guys.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.081
He kept the weaker minions
to the end.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.709
I mean, I've got nothing
but respect for that guy

21:33.792 --> 21:36.461
as a friend, as an artist,
as a warrior.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.045
- Wow.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.382
[mix of cheers and boos]

21:40.465 --> 21:42.134
Tyler.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.052
I mean, is that
a fair assessment?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.679
- I mean, I definitely
was not a minion

21:45.762 --> 21:47.139
{\an8}We had a solid plan
from the get-go.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.390
{\an8}- But you just shook hands
with a guy

21:48.473 --> 21:50.517
who called you a minion.
- Ah, that's--

21:50.600 --> 21:53.395
that's behind-the-scenes
[bleep], but whatever.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.730
[laughter]

21:54.813 --> 21:56.565
No, we had a plan to make it
to the end.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.068
I should be up there in one
of their places, for sure.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.947
- Wow.
Katie, let me ask you this.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.159
Do you think that Chris
used these guys?

22:07.242 --> 22:09.911
{\an8}- I do think that he used some
of them.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.080
{\an8}I am surprised
by the continuous support.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.874
Also, St. Marq is a douche.

22:13.957 --> 22:20.756
[cheers and applause]

22:28.221 --> 22:31.266
- Wow.
Craig, let me ask you.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.602
What did you think
of Chris's strategy?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.562
- Um, I feel like that he was
a control freak

22:35.645 --> 22:39.608
and kind of take control
of a lot of people in the house,

22:39.691 --> 22:41.276
and once they got compromised,

22:41.359 --> 22:42.110
he kind of turned his back
on 'em.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.237
- I mean, it is a strategy game.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.530
I mean, Chris, you're up there.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.990
Everybody's talking about you.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.950

How do you respond to all this?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.911
- I couldn't hear anything.
- Okay. [laughs]

22:50.994 --> 22:52.788
Very, very--
that's a smart move, man.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.457
- That's all I got.
- That is a smart move.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.958
- Tell me what they're saying,
I'll come back.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.127
- All right, man.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.296
Well, unfortunately,
I gotta move along again

23:01.379 --> 23:04.424
'cause Chris, Matt, and Kruseman
are tattooing live

23:04.508 --> 23:06.301
and time is almost up.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.803
And this time,
I'd like the audience

23:07.886 --> 23:09.846
to do it with me,
if you would.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.223
You got five left.

it is a little dark.

kind of falls a little short.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.099
The only thing about it to me
that it's lacking

is a little bit
of that strong punch, you know?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.313
It's a really monotone tattoo
in relationship

34:25.396 --> 34:27.106
to the color or her tanned skin,
so a little bit more

34:27.190 --> 34:29.150

sent this tattoo home.

48:28.864 --> 48:31.074
{\an1}and you're gonna [bleep]
something up now?

48:31.158 --> 48:31.700
{\an1}<i>You're the one</i>
<i>might be going home.</i>

48:31.783 --> 48:32.826
- Your teammate's gone,

48:32.909 --> 48:35.412
and you definitely
aren't bulletproof anymore.

48:35.495 --> 48:37.039
- Graduated Honorman
in the Marine Corps...by myself.

48:37.122 --> 48:40.125
Got where I got in my career
tattooing by myself.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.127
I will win this whole thing.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.712
<i>Dave: I love this tattoo.</i>

48:43.795 --> 48:46.089
<i>Oliver: Great color play,</i>
<i>great dynamics.</i>

48:46.173 --> 48:48.717
- It is a solid, strong,
badass tattoo.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.344
<i>- I've left my loving</i>
<i>girlfriend,</i>

48:50.427 --> 48:53.138
<i>my new baby, my two children,</i>
<i>all to come here to compete.</i>

48:53.221 --> 48:54.473
The only mission I have is to
win the title of Ink Master

48:54.556 --> 48:55.932
and win the $100,000.

48:59.394 --> 49:01.521
[cheers and applause]

49:01.605 --> 49:04.024
- There he is.

49:04.107 --> 49:05.067
Chris...

49:05.150 --> 49:09.446
go ahead and reveal
your master canvas, buddy.

49:09.529 --> 49:11.531
- Go ahead.

49:14.159 --> 49:15.744
- Hey, now.

49:15.827 --> 49:18.288
[cheers and applause]

49:20.415 --> 49:23.335
Chris, tell us about it, man.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.925
Tell us about your tattoo,
buddy.

49:30.008 --> 49:31.802
[whistles and whooping]
[louder] Tell us about it.

49:31.885 --> 49:33.804
- Tell us about it.
- Yes.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.555
{\an1}- You got it.
[clears throat]

49:35.639 --> 49:37.307
{\an1}Well, in all the past
seasons,

49:37.391 --> 49:39.101
{\an1}you guys did pin-ups,
and I wasn't gonna let you guys

49:39.184 --> 49:40.727
get away--you old masters--

49:40.811 --> 49:42.562
{\an1}get away with me
not doing a pin-up.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.981
{\an1}So I did a pin-up girl for you,
full color saturation,

49:45.065 --> 49:46.066
{\an1}although I made sure it had
something to do with Route 66,

49:46.149 --> 49:49.069
hot rod, desert theme,
kind of a pin-up angel.

49:49.152 --> 49:50.404
Dave, pretty girl for you.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.322
- Thank you.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.116
{\an1}- And Nuñez, you've been
my biggest critic all season,

49:54.199 --> 49:56.076
{\an1}so I made sure I gave you
a little bit of every challenge,

49:56.159 --> 49:58.120
{\an1}a little bit of texture,
little bit of composition,

49:58.203 --> 50:00.038
{\an1}little line work,
little bit of everything.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.289
That's how I--

50:01.373 --> 50:02.332
- Ollie, let's hear it, man.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.501
- Well, Chris, this is one
big, badass tattoo

50:04.584 --> 50:06.962
for sure, man.

50:07.045 --> 50:09.756
All three of these tattoos
are coming out really sharp.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.508
I like a lot about
this tattoo--

50:11.591 --> 50:14.469
the details, the texture,

50:14.553 --> 50:18.223
You know, there is
wall-to-wall color saturation

50:18.306 --> 50:19.474
in this tattoo.

50:19.558 --> 50:22.519
I do wish it had a little bit
of open skin to breathe.

50:22.602 --> 50:24.312
But the details--
I could go on and on about

50:24.396 --> 50:27.607
how great these tiny details are
throughout this tattoo.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.235
Smooth as butter,
all your fades...

50:30.318 --> 50:31.570
top-notch, man.

50:31.653 --> 50:33.447
This is bulletproof tattoo,
man.

50:33.530 --> 50:36.324
- Look at the street...I mean
the street, that's beautiful.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.118
Chris.

50:38.201 --> 50:39.202
[cheers and applause]

50:45.667 --> 50:46.793
- Chris, I think you deliver

50:46.877 --> 50:49.045
a really strong back piece
here, man.

50:49.129 --> 50:52.466
35 hours--
This is wall-to-wall saturation.

50:52.549 --> 50:53.633
This is a strong piece.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.137
I've never wanted to get
concrete or a street tattooed

50:57.220 --> 50:58.972
as much as I did
when I saw this one.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.307
[laughter]
It looks great, man.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.559
You did some amazing work
here.

51:02.642 --> 51:04.853
I think your bottom
of your tattoo

51:04.936 --> 51:06.188
outdoes the top

51:06.271 --> 51:10.484
in the sense of how much work
and detail you put into it.

51:10.567 --> 51:14.237
{\an3}But overall, man, this is 35
hours of going and getting 'em.

51:14.321 --> 51:17.032
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

51:18.825 --> 51:21.495
- Well done, buddy.

51:21.578 --> 51:22.954
Good job.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.414
As soon as we come back,

51:24.498 --> 51:26.583
we are going to critique
Kruseman's master canvas.

51:26.666 --> 51:29.377
And we are moments away

51:29.461 --> 51:32.005
from revealing
the next Ink Master.

51:32.088 --> 51:34.674
I've been saying you don't
wanna miss stuff all night long,

51:34.758 --> 51:35.509
but that
you do not wanna miss.

51:42.808 --> 51:47.437
[cheers and applause]

51:49.606 --> 51:51.191

51:51.274 --> 51:53.193
to "Ink Master", live!
[audience chants indistinctly]

51:53.276 --> 51:57.322
There's only one more tattoo
to reveal tonight,

51:57.405 --> 52:00.534
and Kruseman, before we bring
out your master canvas,

52:00.617 --> 52:03.954
let's take a look at how
the competition went for you.

52:06.039 --> 52:07.040
- I been doing this
for 20 years.

52:07.123 --> 52:07.541
Nobody in here
[bleep] intimidates me,

52:07.624 --> 52:09.626
so bring it on.

52:09.709 --> 52:10.877
{\an1}- If they're gonna give
$100,000 to somebody

52:10.961 --> 52:12.128
and call 'em Ink Master,

52:12.212 --> 52:14.339
it sure as [bleep] better not
be the safe Sally over there.

52:14.422 --> 52:16.466
- Creativity in this
is pretty low.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.219
- My very first inclination
is send Kruseman home.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.346
{\an3}- I'll be damned if I'm
sending home a good tattooer.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.639
<i>- So far in this competition,</i>

52:22.722 --> 52:23.765
<i>I've kinda just been</i>
<i>skating by.</i>

52:23.849 --> 52:26.226
{\an8}I'm ready to change that, man.
I need to be on top.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.561
I'm going to the finale.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.729
I don't care whose throat
I gotta cut to get there.

52:29.813 --> 52:30.730
I'm going.

52:30.814 --> 52:32.607
{\an3}- Maybe this is the rebirth
of Kruseman

52:32.691 --> 52:33.400
in this competition.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.569
- Your tattoo looks deliberate.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.280
- This tattoo is one of the most
accurately executed.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.574
- This tattoo really
pulls off the effect

52:40.657 --> 52:42.576
of stained glass.
- You completely came back

52:42.659 --> 52:43.743
and delivered what it was

52:43.827 --> 52:45.245
that you should have
delivered day one.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.080
- I feel like I've swam through
rivers of [bleep] to get here.

52:47.163 --> 52:50.083
There is no way
on God's given earth

52:50.166 --> 52:51.960
at this point
that I'm giving up.

52:52.043 --> 52:54.379
<i>That title is mine.</i>

52:55.672 --> 52:58.592
[cheers and applause]

53:02.804 --> 53:05.515
- All right, Kruseman.

53:05.599 --> 53:08.268
Let's see your
master canvas, buddy.

53:08.351 --> 53:09.644
- Pop it like it's hot.

53:09.728 --> 53:13.273
[cheers and applause]

53:14.566 --> 53:17.444
- Tell us about it, buddy.

53:17.527 --> 53:20.655

53:24.159 --> 53:26.745
Tell us about it.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.708
{\an3}That's not what I said,
but okay.

53:31.791 --> 53:33.126
Tell us about it!

53:33.209 --> 53:35.003
[cheers continue]

53:35.086 --> 53:38.924
Guys, hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

53:39.007 --> 53:40.216
Let the man speak.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.136
Tell us about your tattoo,
buddy.

53:43.219 --> 53:45.972
- Well, I decided to go with
an American traditional tattoo

53:46.056 --> 53:47.641
because I feel like
at this point in the game,

53:47.724 --> 53:49.017
it would have been foolish
for me to go with

53:49.100 --> 53:50.769
something I wasn't
familiar with.

53:50.852 --> 53:51.895
These tattoos
stand the test of time.

53:51.978 --> 53:54.189
This is a hand-drawn tattoo.

53:54.272 --> 53:56.316
It's not a Google image.

53:56.399 --> 53:56.942
[audience whooping]

53:57.025 --> 53:57.984
It's built to last, man,

53:58.068 --> 54:00.779
and I'm super-pumped
on this thing.

54:00.862 --> 54:02.447
I'd wear it myself.

54:02.530 --> 54:03.657
- Ollie.

54:05.450 --> 54:07.535
This one's up your alley.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.456
- Well, Kruseman,
these are the kinda tattoos

54:11.539 --> 54:13.333
that I like the most--
we know that.

54:13.416 --> 54:14.793
American traditional's
my thing.

54:14.876 --> 54:17.462
This tattoo is solid
from top to bottom.

54:17.545 --> 54:19.589
Beautiful tattoo.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.675
[audience whooping]

54:21.758 --> 54:23.969
You did go above and beyond

54:24.052 --> 54:26.554
with 35-hour
American traditional tattoo.

54:26.638 --> 54:28.139
You put a lot more
detail in it.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.225
I think this is
something extra-special.

54:30.308 --> 54:32.519
You really went the extra mile
for the live finale,

54:32.602 --> 54:34.145
and I think that
this tattoo, you know,

54:34.229 --> 54:37.148
speaks volumes
to your artistic ability

54:37.232 --> 54:39.359
throughout
this entire competition.

54:39.442 --> 54:41.361
This is what you fought
to get here for,

54:41.444 --> 54:41.987
and this is it.

54:42.070 --> 54:46.533
[cheers and applause]

54:46.616 --> 54:48.201
- Nuñez.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.954
Got some thoughts here
for Kruseman?

54:51.037 --> 54:53.206
- Well, Kruseman, I think

54:53.289 --> 54:55.834
one thing that's definitely
certain here

54:55.917 --> 54:57.043
is you redeemed all the people

54:57.127 --> 54:58.753
that failed
throughout the competitions

54:58.837 --> 55:00.213
in this category.

55:00.296 --> 55:01.548
You came out
and you came strong

55:01.631 --> 55:03.800
with real strong
traditional elements.

55:03.883 --> 55:04.801
It is busy, man.

55:04.884 --> 55:07.220
You crammed as much
as you could in there.

55:07.303 --> 55:10.223
But it's bulletproof,
and it is a solid tattoo.

55:10.306 --> 55:12.559
[cheers and applause]

55:14.310 --> 55:15.729
- All right.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.899
There you have it--
two amazing master canvases.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.235
Kruseman, thank you.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.406
Okay, excuse your canvas,

55:26.489 --> 55:27.532
and Chris, come on up,
center stage.

55:28.908 --> 55:31.870
This is it, guys.

55:31.953 --> 55:34.664
This is it.
It's been a long road.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.374
We started the season
with 18 artists,

55:36.458 --> 55:40.837
and it all comes down
to Chris and Kruseman.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.882
One of you
is about to win it all--

55:43.965 --> 55:45.925
$100,000,

55:46.009 --> 55:47.343
a Dodge Challenger--

55:47.427 --> 55:49.429
don't forget
that thing's in there--

55:49.512 --> 55:52.474
feature in "Inked" magazine,

55:52.557 --> 55:54.893
and the title of Ink Master.

55:54.976 --> 55:56.936
Lots on the line here.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.856
Judges, it is time to make

55:59.939 --> 56:02.150
our final decision
of the season.

56:02.233 --> 56:04.069
Oliver.
- Well, Dave,

56:04.152 --> 56:06.696
these are 100%
the two best tattoos

56:06.780 --> 56:08.865
we've ever seen
in the finale here.

56:08.948 --> 56:09.991
Two great, strong tattooers,

56:10.075 --> 56:12.285
really pushing it
to the limit

56:12.368 --> 56:15.455
to put this 35-hour back piece
together.

56:15.538 --> 56:18.625
I think that both of you guys
get the thumbs up.

56:18.708 --> 56:23.129
Hard work pays off,
and y'all had it all the time.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.632
[cheers and applause]

56:25.715 --> 56:28.134
{\an3}- So, Ollie,
what are your feelings here?

56:28.218 --> 56:30.303
Where are we going?

56:30.386 --> 56:32.639
- I like a lot about
both these tattoos.

56:32.722 --> 56:34.265
I see a few problems in...

56:34.349 --> 56:36.684
Kruseman's tattoo being
a little over-busy

56:36.768 --> 56:38.228
from a distance.

56:38.311 --> 56:39.145
{\an3}- Yeah, I agree
with that,

56:39.229 --> 56:41.481
- It's badass, though, man.

56:41.564 --> 56:42.982
{\an3}- I think that Chris's
tattoo

56:43.066 --> 56:44.526
has a very strong bottom,

56:44.609 --> 56:46.444
{\an3}a really heavy presence
at the bottom,

56:46.528 --> 56:49.114
{\an3}and then I think just
that big, saturated back area

56:49.197 --> 56:51.950
doesn't catch up
with the bottom.

56:52.033 --> 56:53.618
{\an3}But they're two
full tattoos

56:53.701 --> 56:56.329
{\an3}that display 35 hours
of hard work.

56:56.412 --> 56:58.164
- Yeah, but there's a lot
of detail in the street,

56:58.248 --> 56:59.666
and that back--
I mean, that's sky.

56:59.749 --> 57:01.042
What else can you do?

57:01.126 --> 57:02.043
{\an3}- Right. But it's sky
from the street up.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.546
{\an3}You know?
It's a lotta sky.

57:04.629 --> 57:07.924
{\an1}- I mean, Chris...Chris
really nailed his own style.

57:08.007 --> 57:10.009
{\an1}It is solid saturated.
There's a lotta details.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.053
Um...two great tattoos.

57:12.137 --> 57:13.429
It's really hard
to make a decision.

57:13.513 --> 57:15.098
- I definitely agree
that these are

57:15.181 --> 57:16.891
the strongest
two tattoos we've seen

57:16.975 --> 57:18.143
in a finale.

57:18.226 --> 57:19.561
- Yeah, but Ollie--
listen, man,

57:19.644 --> 57:22.313
hitting all of the things
that we need for a challenge,

57:22.397 --> 57:25.608
{\an3}everything that this show's
based and predicated on--

57:25.692 --> 57:27.193
I have a feeling.

57:27.277 --> 57:30.947
- But these guys were able to
pick whatever style they wanted.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.991
- Right. This was
the free open canvas.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.492
{\an1}- I think both artists
made a smart choice

57:34.576 --> 57:36.119
of their final tattoos.

57:36.202 --> 57:37.620
They both represented
what they loved to do.

57:37.704 --> 57:38.872
{\an3}- Yeah, but whose
tattoo gets it?

57:38.955 --> 57:40.623
- It's a hard choice, man.

57:40.707 --> 57:41.541
{\an3}- Well,
we gotta make it.

57:41.624 --> 57:43.585
{\an3}That's what we're here for.
Let's do it.

57:43.668 --> 57:44.711
- This is what we do.

57:44.794 --> 57:48.882
Chris: Wrap up everything
that you need every season

57:48.965 --> 57:52.051
that you have to think of
that encompasses a master,

57:52.135 --> 57:54.137
and let's put a bow on it.

57:54.220 --> 57:55.388
Oliver: I do like that Chris

57:55.471 --> 57:57.932
put that little traditional
tattoo on her arm to kind of

57:58.016 --> 57:59.225
mix it up with a couple
different styles in there.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.978
- Cool.
- I do have some--

58:02.061 --> 58:03.980
{\an1}a little bit of problems
with some of her skin tone

58:04.063 --> 58:06.024
{\an1}being a little bit orangey
and a little bit weird

58:06.107 --> 58:07.400
and a little bit light--
how's that gonna hold up

58:07.483 --> 58:08.651
{\an1}over time
is the big question.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.070
{\an3}- Yeah. That's a lot of
flesh tone.

58:11.154 --> 58:12.488
- I also would say
that Kruseman...

58:12.572 --> 58:16.951
he went down on the glutes
with this tattoo.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.912
I mean, that thing is...
- Full cover back piece.

58:18.995 --> 58:20.580
- A fitted back piece.

58:20.663 --> 58:21.873
{\an3}- Yeah, but listen,
but Kruseman,

58:21.956 --> 58:25.543
{\an3}he's got a couple areas where
the shading at the bottom--

58:25.627 --> 58:27.253
it's debatable.

58:27.337 --> 58:28.213
{\an3}It's strong,
but it's not as clean

58:28.296 --> 58:30.590
{\an3}as some of the other
areas of it.

58:30.673 --> 58:32.800
And the thing is busy.

58:32.884 --> 58:34.427
It is bangin'.

58:34.510 --> 58:38.014
- Guys, let me--let me--
let's bring it in.

58:40.975 --> 58:45.271
[audience commotion]

58:52.320 --> 58:56.866
[chanting "Kruseman"]

59:10.880 --> 59:13.758
All right, guys,
here we go.

59:13.841 --> 59:16.094
The judges have decided.

59:21.891 --> 59:23.476
Kruseman...

59:23.559 --> 59:24.978
you do...

59:25.061 --> 59:26.312
