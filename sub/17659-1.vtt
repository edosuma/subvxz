02:44.731 --> 02:47.131
Whew! That was close.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.560
What happens
if I get inside the clock
and the watchman's there?

02:51.638 --> 02:53.629
Think fast, George.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.606
That's a break.
He's off duty.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.648
More guards. The lobby's
sewed up like a sack,

03:08.721 --> 03:10.712
and they said,
"Shoot to kill."

03:10.790 --> 03:14.123
They meant you, George.
You.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.355
How'd I get
into this rat race, anyway?

03:16.429 --> 03:19.990
I'm no criminal.
What happened?
When did it all start?

03:21.801 --> 03:24.463
Just 36 hours ago
I was down there,

03:24.537 --> 03:27.165
crossing that lobby
on my way to work,
minding my own business,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.333
looking forward to
my first vacation in years.

03:29.409 --> 03:33.402
Thirty-six hours ago
I was a decent, respectable
law-abiding citizen...

03:33.479 --> 03:35.845
with a wife and a kid
and a big job.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.407
Just 36 hours ago
by the big clock.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.476
And it's the most accurate...

03:41.554 --> 03:45.320
and the most unique
privately-owned clock
in the world.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.121
Now, behind this huge
map of the globe...

03:48.194 --> 03:50.719
is a single
master mechanism.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.459
Built at a cost
of $600,000,

03:53.533 --> 03:56.934
it is set so you can
tell the time
anywhere on the Earth:

03:57.003 --> 04:01.497
London, Chicago,
Honolulu and so forth.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.600
It also
synchronizes the clocks
in this building...

04:04.677 --> 04:06.872
with those in the secondary
printing plants...

04:06.946 --> 04:09.744
in Kansas City
and San Francisco...

04:09.816 --> 04:13.479
and in the 43 foreign bureaus
of the Janoth organization.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.953
Hey, mister,
I'd like to ask somethin'.
Yes, sir.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.956
What happens
if the clock stops?

04:18.024 --> 04:20.584
Oh, Mr. Janoth
would never permit that.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.722
Good morning, Betty.
Good morning, Mr. Stroud.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.790
Here it is.
Thank you.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.098
We will now visit
the public exhibits...

04:31.170 --> 04:33.104
displaying
the latest developments...

04:33.172 --> 04:36.005
in the various fields
covered by the Janoth
publications.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.340
Elevator is going up.
Going up.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.610
This elevator
is going up.
Next car, please.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.742
Hello, Joe.
Hiya, George.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.752
Hello, George.
Hello, Lily.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.278
You're looking mighty
smart this morning.
Well, thank you.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.757
I should ride this
more often.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.818
- Sportways.
- Hold it!

04:56.896 --> 04:59.160
Ten, please.
Hello, Miss Gold.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.166
Oh, hello.
Mister, would you mind?

05:01.234 --> 05:05.603
The elevator doesn't run
unless the door is closed.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.607
Do you work this shift
every day?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.574
Airways.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.670
We might feature
the reliability angle.

05:14.747 --> 05:18.615
You're safer in an airplane
than you are in a bathtub.
Here's a sketch.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.710
We've got nice elevators
in our building too.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.348
Come on over sometime.
I'll give you a free ride.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.654
Artways. Up.
Down?

05:28.728 --> 05:31.219
What's the matter?
I got poison ivy?

05:31.297 --> 05:34.095
We are not allowed
to speak to people
in the elevators.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.102
Mr. Janoth
doesn't permit it.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.832
Styleways, please.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.840
Watch your step.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.641
Gentlemen,
watch yourselves.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.149
Newsways, please.
Newsways.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.553
Newsways.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.791
Crimeways.
Eleven?

06:04.063 --> 06:07.055
"Age 63, frequents
Metropolite City Club,

06:07.133 --> 06:09.363
Skyview Luncheon Club.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.369
Background: banking
business for 46 years..."

06:11.437 --> 06:14.235
I'm expecting him any minute.
I'll tell him
the instant he arrives.

06:14.307 --> 06:18.641
Hold it. Mr. Stroud,
Salt Lake's on the line, and
your wife's trying to reach you.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.077
Put Salt Lake on.
All right, fine.
But they're on.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.081
The conference.
It's almost 11:00.
Plenty of time.

06:23.149 --> 06:27.449
But Mr. Janoth...
Hello. Yeah?
Yes, this is Stroud.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.954
Hello, Max.
How you makin' out?
But, George...

06:30.022 --> 06:34.356
Ya have? Oh, wonderful!
Where was he?
What did I tell ya?

06:34.427 --> 06:37.021
Once a seashell man,
always a seashell man.
They're waiting.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.031
Will he talk?
Well, pretend you're
a fellow collector.

06:40.099 --> 06:43.591
Ask him if he was gonna
spend the dough
on oysters or blondes.

06:43.669 --> 06:48.333
Yeah. You've got an hour
and 53 minutes to get
the story. Attaboy, Max.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.399
We've just located Fleming.
They're waiting for you.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.001
Grace,
call the composing room.
We're gonna replate.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.480
And get my wife.
George, you're
the only one not there.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.540
Mr. Janoth
will be furious.
Time is money.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.246
Fleming is in Salt Lake.
Milner's gonna
wire us a story.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.289
Here are the proofs
of the story you had set up.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.019
Go on, Roy. Go on. Hello?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.618
Oh, hello, darling.
Yeah.

07:09.695 --> 07:15.065
Huh?
No bath and no oatmeal?
Let me talk to him.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.068
All right,
but he doesn't
believe he's going.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.537
He thinks it's
just like last trip
and the time before...

07:20.606 --> 07:23.473
and all the other trips
we didn't go on.

07:23.543 --> 07:27.536
I'll let you talk to him.
George, Daddy wants
to talk to you.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.942
Hello, Daddy.
But I don't believe
we're going.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.649
But this is the McCoy,
an expedition. Your mother's
gonna do the cooking.

07:37.723 --> 07:41.420
What? Yeah,
I know it's tough,
but you'll do the hunting.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.759
That's why you should
eat your oatmeal,
build up your strength.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.823
Ya better believe me.
Look under my pillow.

07:53.005 --> 07:57.271
Oh, boy! Look, Mommy!
An atomic disintegrator!

07:59.378 --> 08:03.371
I think you've
sold him, Wonderman.
I'll let you know at lunch.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.383
A little child psychology,
dear.

08:05.451 --> 08:09.751
All right, dear,
12:30 at the Van Barth.
Bye, darling.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.815
Today's agenda
is solely on the subject
of increasing circulation.

08:13.893 --> 08:17.021
The figures
for the second quarter
have fallen off badly.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.621
From a monthly high
of 33 million in January,

08:19.699 --> 08:21.792
we've had
a six-percent recession,

08:21.868 --> 08:23.893
a loss of almost
2 million copies.

08:23.970 --> 08:28.771
In some cases, we are below
the circulation levels we have
guaranteed our advertisers.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.277
Mr. Janoth's very upset.
He's going to want ideas.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.485
Sit down, gentlemen.
Sit down.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.585
I resent this.
I resent this deeply.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.621
There are
2,081,376,000 seconds
in the average man's life,

08:53.699 --> 08:55.860
each tick of the clock
the beat of a heart,

08:55.935 --> 08:58.369
and yet you sit here
uselessly ticking
your lives away...

08:58.437 --> 09:00.462
because certain members
are not on schedule.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.270
Where is George Stroud?
Roy's trying
to find him.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.834
I do not propose
to be held up,
not even by Mr. Stroud.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.847
Have you told the others
what we want?

09:08.915 --> 09:12.476
Ideas to build circulation.
Not just ideas.
Dynamic angles.

09:12.552 --> 09:17.888
We live in a dynamic age
with dynamic competitors...
radio, newspapers, newsreels...

09:17.957 --> 09:21.620
and we must anticipate trends
before they are trends.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.322
We are, in effect,
clairvoyants. Correct?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.797
Yes, Mr. Janoth.

09:26.866 --> 09:31.894
I have provided the tools:
a budget of $37 million,
a staff of 3,600,

09:31.971 --> 09:35.498
bureaus from Reykjavik
to Cairo, Moscow
to Buenos Aires.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.807
All this is waste, sheer
waste under a leadership
of chuckleheads.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.815
Mr. Roberts, you have
exactly one minute to tell us
how you propose...

09:43.883 --> 09:46.977
to add 100,000
subscriptions to Newsways.

09:49.388 --> 09:53.449
Well, uh, I suggest
that we offer prizes...

09:53.526 --> 09:56.324
for the best letters
from subscribers...

09:56.395 --> 09:59.159
on, uh, how to preserve
world peace.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.722
Sorry, Mr. Janoth.
A thousand dollars
each week...

10:01.801 --> 10:04.998
and a grand prize
of $25,000
to be awarded...

10:05.071 --> 10:08.234
The general theory
of the publishing business
is to sell magazines,

10:08.307 --> 10:10.241
not to pay people
to read them.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.244
Mr. Cordette is acting manager
during Stroud's vacation.

10:13.312 --> 10:18.306
You have one minute to tell us
your ideas on how to add
50,000 readers to Crimeways.

10:18.384 --> 10:22.946
Well, uh, I have
one suggestion
that might be of value:

10:23.022 --> 10:26.014
a new feature to be called
"Solution of the Week."

10:26.092 --> 10:28.652
Miss Perkins.
Yes, Mr. Janoth?

10:28.728 --> 10:32.892
I'm listening, Cordette.
Hold the Boston call.
The most important...

10:32.965 --> 10:35.832
or the most unique solution,
Steve, remind me
of the Boston business.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.426
highlighting the fact
that crime does not pay.

10:38.504 --> 10:41.405
It's educational...
Primigenous, stale,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.466
a hash-up
of last week's news...
exactly what we don't want.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.341
Fleming.
What was that,
uh, Stroud?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.904
I was reminding him of Fleming.
The absconder?

10:49.982 --> 10:53.383
Yes. His story will sell
a hundred thousand
extra copies next week.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.386
If you mean his personal
story, I'd agree,

10:55.454 --> 10:57.888
but haven't you overlooked
the necessity of finding him?

10:57.957 --> 11:00.517
We have.
Found him.
Have what?

11:00.593 --> 11:03.187
We have him in Salt Lake.
We're replating one and two.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.891
It's too late to touch
the cover, but we'll run...

11:06.966 --> 11:10.026
a paper band around every
copy with "Fleming Found"
in block letters.

11:10.102 --> 11:13.071
Make them red.
Steve, advertise this
in the morning papers.

11:13.139 --> 11:17.235
Use the 25 key cities.
Young man, you've
stumbled on something...

11:17.309 --> 11:20.540
not exactly what
I've been looking for,
but nonetheless valuable.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.740
You have struck 12:00.
Thank you.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.079
Contrary to the anticipated
nationwide trend,

11:25.151 --> 11:29.850
media research reports
a present level
of want-to-buy at 25.6.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.856
Oh, hello, George.
Sit down.

11:31.924 --> 11:36.861
Up.4 from last month.
Nevertheless, our circulation
fails to reflect this trend.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.955
Uh, I'll
finish this later,
Miss Blanchard.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.229
George, you're getting
to be a regular
missing persons bureau.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.236
Fleming's number three
this year.
Four,

11:45.304 --> 11:48.569
if you count
the man we found
hiding in his own basement.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.109
What are your plans
for next week?
That's Cordette's problem.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.111
Mine shall be
in West Virginia.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.376
Mr. Janoth wants you
to follow through...
personally.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.383
On my vacation?
Postponed.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.885
Oh, no.
He can't do that.
This is my honeymoon.

12:00.953 --> 12:04.389
Honeymoon?
With a five-year-old child?
Yes. You know why?

12:04.457 --> 12:06.391
Janoth.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.019
Seven years ago,
I was assistant editor
at the Wheeling Clarion,

12:09.095 --> 12:11.029
a happy man.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.032
Then I run down a guy
police in three states
have been looking for.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.227
Headlines three feet high.
I got a $15 raise.

12:16.302 --> 12:19.863
So I marry my girl,
and we go on our honeymoon
to Indian Lake.

12:19.939 --> 12:24.137
Idyllic.
I'm about to carry her over the
threshold when the phone rings.

12:24.210 --> 12:28.510
It's Janoth. Wants me to run
Crimeways magazine, "the Police
Blotter of the Nation."

12:28.581 --> 12:31.049
Not next week
or tomorrow,
but tonight!

12:31.117 --> 12:33.381
Two hours later,
we're on the train
for New York.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.716
You'd have done better
to stay at 50 bucks a week?

12:35.788 --> 12:41.351
I had more in the bank then
than I have now, and my wife
still hasn't had a honeymoon.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.725
Put yourself
in her place, Steve.

12:43.796 --> 12:48.460
How would you like to be a woman
who never had a honeymoon?
It's become an obsession.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.729
I've been working
26 hours a day,

12:50.803 --> 12:53.271
Christmases, Fourth of Julys,
Mother's Days.

12:53.339 --> 12:58.140
What does Janoth think I am,
a clock with springs and gears
instead of flesh and blood?

12:58.210 --> 13:02.078
That's not the right attitude.
Janoth expects loyalty.

13:02.148 --> 13:05.982
Oh, I'm loyal, all right.
Shut that thing off.

13:07.653 --> 13:11.453
What are you
doing here?
Just tidying up, darling.

13:11.524 --> 13:15.756
Isn't that the young man
you pointed out as
"the troublesome Mr. Stroud"?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.854
You find him interesting?
How did you get up here?

13:18.931 --> 13:20.990
Well, it did
present a problem.

13:21.066 --> 13:25.867
The tycoon's lair,
the Berchtesgaden
of the publishing world,

13:25.938 --> 13:28.566
seemed impregnable
till I thought
of your private elevator.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.734
How did you
get past the guard?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.937
He's human.
Mm-hmm.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.310
You're the only
Superman around here.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.815
I think he must've been
winding his watch.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.852
You don't expect me
to approve
of your being here.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.754
Not even on business?
My singing lessons.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.385
Hagen attended to that
yesterday. You should have
had a check this morning.

13:48.460 --> 13:52.794
But he made a mistake.
They were to cost $2,000.

13:57.069 --> 14:00.300
Remember?

14:00.372 --> 14:03.170
Perhaps you think my voice
isn't worth cultivating.

14:03.242 --> 14:07.269
Your voice
is worth exactly
what that check reads.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.371
Miss Perkins?
Yes, Mr. Janoth?

14:09.448 --> 14:13.248
Get me the name of the guard
on my private elevator.
Yes, sir.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.686
The public elevators
are this way. I'm
six minutes behind schedule.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.189
I have to fly
to Washington at 6:10,

14:19.258 --> 14:22.694
and I will not have
my papers disarranged.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.059
It confuses my secretary.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.692
I'll see you
tomorrow night.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.730
10:55.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.412
If I wasn't up to my ears,
I'd tell Janoth...

14:48.487 --> 14:50.921
to take his $30,000
and buy another clock.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.050
Nobody's indispensable
to this organization
except Mr. Janoth.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.060
Mull it over.
I don't have to.

14:56.128 --> 14:59.188
It's honeymoon
regardless.
Even if it means your job?

14:59.265 --> 15:02.257
Well, does it?
Mull it over.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.107
Yes, Earl.

15:09.174 --> 15:12.234
When does he think
he's leaving?
Late this afternoon.

15:12.311 --> 15:16.247
I couldn't do a thing.
I'd better take charge
of the young man.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.148
Oh, and, Steve,
on the fourth floor
in the broom closet,

15:19.218 --> 15:22.016
a bulb has been burning
for several days.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.682
Find the man responsible.
Dock his pay.
Yes, Earl.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.415
Table, miss?
No, thank you.
I'm looking for someone.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.214
Oh, there they are.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.278
Pardon me.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.050
How about another?

16:02.127 --> 16:04.755
I really shouldn't.
Bartender,
two more stingers.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.821
Make it three.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.935
Uh, no, just two,
please.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.870
I have to go.
An appointment
with my psychiatrist.

16:18.544 --> 16:22.947
Do you always drink
stingers, Mr. Stroud?
Mm-hmm.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.677
What makes you think
my name is Stroud?
Oh, I'm psychic...

16:25.751 --> 16:28.117
horoscopes,
crystal balls, astrology.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.213
Perhaps I should've
brought a deck of cards.
Your hand will do.

16:34.226 --> 16:39.027
Oh, I see a stranger
coming into your life,

16:39.098 --> 16:41.259
a woman of mystery.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.699
Does she know
I'm married?

16:43.769 --> 16:48.604
Yes. And I saw
a recent quarrel
with a very unpleasant man,

16:48.674 --> 16:50.608
a publisher,

16:50.676 --> 16:54.510
and the words, "26 hours
a day, Christmases,
Fourth of Julys..."

16:54.580 --> 16:58.676
Wait a minute.
You've been doing a lot more
than just reading palms.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.515
You might add a pinch
of listening in Earl's
office this morning.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.852
What were you doing
in his office?
We're old friends.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.858
Perhaps I should say
we were.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.894
Didn't think he had
any friends.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.896
Thought all he was
crazy about was clocks.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.661
Maybe I have
a clock.

17:15.733 --> 17:20.000
What you said this morning
made me think we have
a great deal in common.

17:20.071 --> 17:23.633
You know the inside Janoth.
I know the outside.
And together we...

17:25.711 --> 17:28.612
Oh, oh, Georgette!
Say, you're late.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.615
Oh, oh, this is Miss...
Pauline York.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.049
She was
telling my fortune.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.053
Oh. With tea leaves,
I see.

17:36.121 --> 17:41.821
Don't let me disturb you.
I'm afraid the psychic
vibrations are unsympathetic.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.886
Good-bye, George.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.193
She is psychic.
I'm definitely
unsympathetic.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.200
Let me explain.
It better be good.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.566
Believe me, it is good,
because A:
She just sat down.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.367
B: I wouldn't make
a pass at her on a bet.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.375
C: You knew I'd be along.
And D: This proves it...

17:57.443 --> 18:00.344
a reserved table,
champagne,
everything.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.707
Now, did you
get the tickets?
Mm-hmm.

18:04.783 --> 18:08.310
A drawing room
on the 722
from Penn Station.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.617
Next stop:
Wheeling, West Virginia.

18:10.689 --> 18:14.284
I still can't
believe we're going.
I get so worried sometimes.

18:14.359 --> 18:18.352
Worried? That's no mood
for a honeymoon, darling.
I know,

18:18.430 --> 18:20.762
but sometimes I think
you married that magazine.

18:20.833 --> 18:25.600
We got a certificate
that says different.
But we're like two strangers.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.970
Either you come
dragging home too tired
to talk to me,

18:29.041 --> 18:31.976
or you're having fun
with some dancer
in San Francisco.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.411
I told you.
That was an article.
I could write an article:

18:35.481 --> 18:39.212
"How to Look at a Wall
in Six Easy Lessons."

18:39.284 --> 18:42.879
We should have stayed
in West Virginia.
We'd be a family now,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.651
an honest-to-goodness,
full-time family.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.658
George, the whole thing
is wrong.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.923
Little George doesn't know you.
A boy needs his father,

18:50.996 --> 18:53.760
someone to teach him
how to play football,
make model airplanes.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.993
I tell you, darling,
it's all different now.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.435
That's what you said
last year before you didn't
show up at the airport.

18:59.505 --> 19:05.171
Nothing will stop me this time,
neither snow nor rain nor heat
nor gloom of night.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.008
Here's to a very
happy honeymoon,
Mrs. Stroud.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.641
And a happy honeymoon
to you, sir.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.329
It's just as topical...
Wait. Both of you.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.628
Mr. Stroud, composing room
is screaming for those proofs.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.260
There might be something
in that comic strip
artist murder.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.463
Might feature cartoons
instead of photographs.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.803
Might work up
a weekly feature:
cartoon crimes.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.808
Mr. Stroud, Mr. Janoth
calling on one.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.810
Why don't we have a...
Shh! Janoth.

19:39.878 --> 19:43.974
Yes, Mr. Janoth. Yes, sir.
Bearing right down on it.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.280
Running off the bands now.
Green.

19:47.352 --> 19:51.083
But, Mr. Janoth, the printer
doesn't like red ink,
says it won't match.

19:51.156 --> 19:54.421
But you can't fire a man
because he doesn't
like red ink.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.453
I guess you can.
Yes, sir.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.727
All set up
for the next two weeks.
What's that?

20:01.800 --> 20:04.860
I'll be here till
about 4:30 this afternoon.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.395
Why, yes, I... I'd like
to say good-bye to you too.

20:10.008 --> 20:12.169
Come on, fellas.
Let's get to work.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.235
Mr. Hagen wants you...

20:16.615 --> 20:19.675
We'll get by this issue,
but I hate to think
about the next two weeks.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.049
Stop worrying, Roy.
Everything's gonna
be all right.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.088
Mr. Janoth is coming.
What?

20:24.156 --> 20:26.590
Mr. Janoth is coming.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.422
George, you whetted
my curiosity.

20:29.494 --> 20:32.224
Nice of you to come down,
Mr. Janoth. I was tied up.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.265
This job you've been
doing finding people...

20:34.333 --> 20:37.666
Fleming, Cipriani,
Mrs. Dewhurst...
ahead of the police:

20:37.736 --> 20:40.204
How do you do it?
You've heard
of our blackboard.

20:40.272 --> 20:43.969
I suspect
it's more than that.
Well, let me show you.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.670
We call it "the system
of the irrelevant clue."

20:46.745 --> 20:50.272
The police look for relevant
clues. They haven't
got time for much else.

20:50.349 --> 20:55.446
We assemble all the clues.
We recreate the man:
his character, mind, emotions.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.080
When you have that,
it's easy to figure out
where he'll be.

20:58.156 --> 21:02.092
Interesting.
You'd never guess what broke
the Fleming case: seashells.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.856
He was a collector.
Paleozoic bivalves.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.661
I checked his index
and found that he had
every variety except one.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.464
I had the name...
Never mind
about the name, George.

21:11.536 --> 21:15.097
Anyway, this shell
is in the conchological wing
of the Salt Lake Museum...

21:15.173 --> 21:18.904
and it's not for sale,
so I assigned a man
to watch it constantly.

21:18.977 --> 21:23.710
Fleming was going to steal it?
Wouldn't you steal something
if you wanted it badly enough?

21:23.782 --> 21:28.583
I might. George,
you're an intelligent man,
and you've done a fine job.

21:28.654 --> 21:32.954
The credit belongs
to the Crimeways staff.
They dig up the details.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.391
That's another thing
I like about you:
You're modest.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.793
That's why we've worked
so well together.
We've had our differences.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.798
They've been immaterial.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.800
Six years, isn't it?
Uh, seven.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.928
Shoulder-to-shoulder,
comrades in arms, neither
letting the other down.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.734
And we've forged ahead.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.298
Now this,
uh, Fleming story,

21:51.376 --> 21:54.709
properly followed up,
should boost circulation
10 percent.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.374
Oh, 15.
That's the spirit.

21:57.449 --> 22:01.283
I know you'll squeeze
every ounce out of it.

22:01.353 --> 22:04.117
I'll give you
carte blanche
for the next month.

22:05.123 --> 22:07.057
Play it for drama
and suspense.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.616
Use anybody
in the organization.
Wait a minute.

22:09.695 --> 22:13.495
Did you say "next month"?
Then your vacation,
all expenses paid,

22:13.565 --> 22:16.932
South America...
West Virginia
and tonight.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.671
George.

22:20.739 --> 22:24.231
You really had me goin'
until I began to gag
over that soft soap.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.607
I'll dispense
with the soap.

22:26.678 --> 22:31.081
George, you'll see this through
with us or you're finished
with Janoth Publications.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.913
That's okay with me.
And I'll have you, uh,

22:33.985 --> 22:35.953
blacklisted
all over the country.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.320
You'll never work
on another magazine
or any other publication.

22:39.391 --> 22:43.157
It's still okay.
I'll give you six minutes
to reconsider.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.662
I don't need them.
I don't need six seconds.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.962
Good afternoon, Miss Adams.
How's that baby of yours?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.502
Fine.
Splendid.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.325
Mr. Stroud?

23:16.395 --> 23:19.489
Yes.
There's someone on the line
for you... a woman.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.556
What's her name?
She won't say. I think
she's selling something.

23:22.634 --> 23:26.900
Keeps talking
about telling your fortune.
Oh, put her on.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.202
Yes, sir.

23:29.274 --> 23:32.107
How are ya?
Wanna make a bet?

23:32.177 --> 23:35.203
Five-to-one your crystal ball
hasn't given ya
the latest flash.

23:35.280 --> 23:39.341
I have been fired
as of 5:22 this afternoon,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.784
name inscribed in gold letters
at the head of the blacklist,

23:41.853 --> 23:43.912
never to work
in publishing again.

23:43.989 --> 23:48.392
- What are you going to do?
- First, I'm goin' out to get a stiff drink.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.621
Good. I'll join you.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.754
I'm sorry, but I have
to go on my vacation.

23:52.831 --> 23:57.427
But this is business.
You see, he thinks he's
gonna blacklist me too,

23:57.502 --> 24:02.337
but I know enough about
Mr. Janoth to make him change
his mind about both of us.

24:02.407 --> 24:08.107
You'll find it to our benefit
to meet me at the Van Barth
in, say, about a half an hour?

24:08.180 --> 24:11.274
If you think it's
that important, I'll drop by.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.320
Another martini, please.
Pardon me, please.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.856
Same for me.

24:18.924 --> 24:22.951
And what
do you think she does?
She marries her sponsor.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.897
Excuse me.
All right.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.901
Can you imagine?
Just because a fella doesn't
like red ink, he fires him.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.335
Earl hates green.
Oh, he does?

24:33.405 --> 24:38.342
Bartender, bring us
two more stingers, and this time
make them with green mint.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.708
With green mint?
Green mint.
That's what the boy said.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.713
Oh, no.

24:42.781 --> 24:46.615
George, at the office,
did you ever use
the confidential files?

24:46.685 --> 24:49.415
I practically lived in 'em.
That's what
I was hoping.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.854
You know, Earl has
a passion for obscurity.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.221
He won't even
have his biography
in Who's Who.

24:54.292 --> 24:58.319
Sure. He doesn't want to let
his left hand know whose pocket
the right one is picking.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.330
I think
we can remedy that.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.925
You mean
write his biography?
Who'd buy it?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.936
Earl would.

25:07.239 --> 25:10.003
You know, that's
a very interesting idea,

25:10.075 --> 25:12.839
but not in my line.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.607
What time is it?
7:25.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.978
You'll excuse me, but...
What?

25:18.049 --> 25:19.983
7:25.

25:20.051 --> 25:23.145
Holy smoke.
We've missed our train.
There are other trains.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.121
My wife will never
forgive me.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.590
You'd better bring two more.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.593
Make 'em triples.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.595
With green mint.
Green.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.597
Horrible.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.607
She left?
I was supposed
to pick her up.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.611
Hey, just a minute,
will ya?

25:47.679 --> 25:49.613
She picked herself up,
Mr. Stroud,

25:49.681 --> 25:53.549
and she said
if you weren't at the station
by train time, she was leaving.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.823
Thanks, Daisy.

25:59.891 --> 26:03.793
If I don't get
to that phone, I'm gonna
be in trouble at home.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.330
Trouble?
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.804
If you don't mind.

26:13.872 --> 26:17.808
Hello. Everything all right?
Wouldn't even wait a couple
of minutes for me.

26:17.876 --> 26:21.209
I give up my job,
jeopardize my career
for her sake,

26:21.279 --> 26:23.304
and she won't even wait
a couple of minutes.

26:23.381 --> 26:26.316
That's the trouble
with the world: time.
There's too much of it.

26:26.384 --> 26:29.319
Greenwich time,
mean time,
mountain standard time,

26:29.387 --> 26:31.321
double British
summer time.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.323
There's
too much of it.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.325
Down with it all.
Man against time.

26:35.393 --> 26:37.953
Tonight we fight
behind the barricades.

26:38.029 --> 26:40.020
Barkeep, where are
those two drinks?
Here.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.658
Don't shilly-shally.
Let's have 'em.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.794
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.668
I hope nothing's damaged.
Here, use mine.
It's bigger.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.935
If you wish, I'll have
your handkerchief dried.

26:51.009 --> 26:53.443
Just get us a couple
of dry drinks.
With green mint.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.445
With green ink...
uh, mint.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.650
Don't forget that.
Oh.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.652
My singing lessons.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.654
Didn't realize Hagen
was a music lover.

27:03.722 --> 27:08.159
He just signs the checks
for Earl, who also happens
not to love music.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.251
Well, we'll throw
clocks at him.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.621
Green clocks.

27:15.166 --> 27:18.465
Come on. Let's get clocks.
Hundreds of'em, all green.

27:18.536 --> 27:21.164
You can forget
those other two drinks.

27:32.017 --> 27:36.511
White clocks, yellow clocks,
brown clocks, blue clocks.

27:36.588 --> 27:40.649
Ah, Miss York, where are
the green clocks
of yesteryear?

27:40.725 --> 27:42.659
Hey, a picture!

27:44.729 --> 27:47.220
How do they expect
to sell things like that?

27:47.298 --> 27:52.258
If that's what I think it is,
it's gonna be worth a lot
of lettuce one of these days.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.931
This is the object, madam?
Yes.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.941
Where did you find it?
It was part of a lot.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.944
A lot of what?
A lot of things.
A consignment.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.947
I admit it is a trifle...
a trifle...

28:04.015 --> 28:06.040
How much
do you want for it?

28:06.117 --> 28:09.609
Well, I haven't set
a price for it yet.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.624
Ten dollars?
Well, that's quite cheap,
but considering its condition...

28:13.692 --> 28:17.594
I'll give ya $20.
I didn't realize
this was an auction.

28:19.664 --> 28:23.122
Ten dollars,
and you needn't wrap it.
Just a moment, please.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.068
If this gentleman thinks
it's worth $20...
He doesn't want it.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.071
Oh, yes, I do.
Who's it by?

28:28.139 --> 28:31.074
It's by someone
named, uh, Patterson.

28:31.142 --> 28:34.134
Did you think
it was by Rembrandt?

28:34.212 --> 28:38.376
Why not?
Oh, leave us not haggle.
I'll give you 30 bucks for it.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.645
Well,
that's more like it.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.746
Isn't it a pity
the wrong people
always have money?

28:47.358 --> 28:50.384
That's not
what we came in for.
What was it?

28:50.462 --> 28:52.396
Clocks.
Why, clocks.
Certainly.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.955
Green clocks.
Green clocks. Oh, no.

28:55.033 --> 28:58.059
I'm sorry.
No green clocks here.
That's a strange attitude...

28:58.136 --> 29:00.263
to two tried-and-true
customers.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.068
Very well.
Very, very well.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.075
My guarantee
still stands:

29:05.143 --> 29:08.670
a free drink to anyone
who can ask me
for something I haven't got.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.545
We should have
thought of this place
a long time ago.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.176
Good evenin',
Mr. Stroud.
Burt, how are you?

29:14.252 --> 29:16.880
What'll it be?
Couple of bourbons
and one for yourself.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.389
We can't mix drinks.
Yes, we can.
That's a fallacy.

29:19.457 --> 29:23.018
Burt. Burt, old boy.
I got ya this time, Burt.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.494
Something he'll never have.
Just watch.

29:25.563 --> 29:30.466
Burt, a bubble.
A nice, big bubble.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.867
This is gonna be
very interesting.

29:32.937 --> 29:37.499
Why don't you try
to think of something
that I have not got?

29:39.577 --> 29:42.512
How do you like...
They got everything.
Look at that there.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.707
Well, Burt, me boy.
Good luck to ya.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.219
Can you think of something
you'd like to see?
Yes. A clock.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.312
That's too easy.
No, it isn't.
This is a green clock.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.323
Green.
Green clock.

29:53.391 --> 29:57.327
Mm-hmm.
Well, must be a green clock
around here somewhere.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.329
Hello, me boy!
How are ya?

29:59.397 --> 30:03.333
Well, George, how are you?
Burt, set one up for
President McKinley, will ya?

30:03.401 --> 30:06.199
Meet the 23rd President
of the United States.

30:06.271 --> 30:08.205
Twenty-fifth, George.
I beg your pardon.

30:08.273 --> 30:11.333
It's a great pleasure.
Thank you.
I heard you were dead.

30:11.409 --> 30:15.345
He is also Colonel
Jefferson Randolph
of Randolph Farms, Georgia.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.349
Colonel Randolph?
We Randolphs, ma'am, propose
to fight the Yankees...

30:19.417 --> 30:22.352
until the last drop
of bourbon has been shed.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.650
Inspector Regan
of the homicide detail.

30:24.722 --> 30:27.850
As an officer of the law,
'tis my duty to warn ya:

30:27.926 --> 30:30.190
Anything this fella says
can be held against him.

30:30.261 --> 30:34.197
Judge Goodbody, Dr. Lifesaver,
Christopher Columbus
and Theodore Roosevelt.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.928
Here's your medicine.
Thank you.
We collectively thank you.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.368
That's all right.
Don't go away
with the glass.

30:40.438 --> 30:43.066
I won't. Very happy
to have met you.
Good luck to you.

30:43.141 --> 30:46.838
So long.
Jefferson Randolph?
Inspector Regan? Who is that?

30:46.911 --> 30:48.970
Radio, Pauline. Radio.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.981
George. George.
What?

30:51.049 --> 30:53.517
Do you remember what
we were talking about?

30:53.585 --> 30:56.520
No. Hey, how about
that clock, Burt?

30:56.588 --> 31:01.287
Oh, the clock. Wait a minute.
I don't think...
Oh, no. It won't do it.

31:01.359 --> 31:05.090
I didn't think so.
Well, how about this?
I said green.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.826
I know. You said green.
Let me see.
Oh, I have it here.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.064
Not in a mile and a half.
A brand-new sundial.

31:13.137 --> 31:18.302
Sundial?
And a nice, green ribbon
from my old uncle's shillelagh.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.311
I'm tellin' ya,
the guy's wonderful.
Just as green...

31:21.379 --> 31:23.313
as the old sod itself.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.248
You're wonderful.
Let's have a little
green music, shall we?

31:26.317 --> 31:30.253
Just a minute.
How about that thing...
Just put it right on the bill.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.657
Hey, laughin' boy, how about
a little green music, huh?

31:34.726 --> 31:37.820
George, claviash.
Oh, Smish, come on.
A little green music.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.830
All right, junior.
"E" flat.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.966
Hey! Yee-hoo!

31:43.034 --> 31:46.197
Burt, set up drinks
for the boys,
and make 'em green!

31:46.271 --> 31:48.398
- Green.
- Got ya!

32:17.201 --> 32:18.725
George. George.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.228
Mmm.
George, come on.

32:21.306 --> 32:24.241
I'm fixing you something.
Mmm.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.277
You'll feel better.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.884
George. George, wake up.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.251
Earl's car's downstairs.
Come on.
Huh? What happened?

32:37.322 --> 32:39.256
You passed out.
He's on his way up.
Who is?

32:39.324 --> 32:41.258
Janoth. Janoth.
Come on, now.
Oh.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.385
You gotta get up.
Hurry. Hurry.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.622
You'll be all right.
Here's your hat.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.222
Here's your hat.
Take your halo.

32:48.299 --> 32:52.998
I want you to have it.
Little memento.
All right, thank you, but hurry.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.438
Wait'll you hear
the elevator,
then use the stairs.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.539
George! George!
Your picture!

33:31.642 --> 33:33.974
Oh, hello, dear.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.172
I'm so glad you didn't
have to stay over.

33:39.283 --> 33:42.218
I said, I'm so glad you didn't
have to stay over.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.481
Was it a pleasant evening?
Marvelous.

33:44.555 --> 33:47.922
Met a lot of bright,
brand-new people.
What were you doing?

33:47.992 --> 33:50.586
Oh, just moving around
from spot to spot:

33:50.661 --> 33:52.652
Van Barth,
a few other places.

33:52.730 --> 33:56.757
Oh, don't
turn the radio on.
I like it. Don't you?

33:56.834 --> 34:00.099
Have a nice trip?
Was he one of them?

34:00.171 --> 34:03.607
One of who?
Oh, you mean the bright,
brand-new people?

34:03.674 --> 34:05.835
Yes.
Who was
this brand-new person?

34:05.910 --> 34:07.878
Just a man.
I don't suppose
you know him.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.879
His name's
Jefferson Randolph.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.609
Southern family.
I suppose.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.981
Charming boy.
What does he do?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.681
Nothing much, I'm afraid.
Sort of a playboy.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.384
Where did you get this?
Some crazy bar he goes to.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.826
At least this time
he wears a clean shirt.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.065
Just what do you mean by that?
You know.

34:29.132 --> 34:33.502
Are you bringing that up again?
Throwing that cab driver in
my face? You never forget him.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.098
No. Do you?
No, you cheap imitation
Napoleon.

34:37.175 --> 34:41.373
And you don't forget
the bellboy or the lifeguard
last summer,

34:41.446 --> 34:43.880
and who knows
how many others?

34:43.947 --> 34:47.406
You don't forget
any of them, including
the one to come.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.646
You talk!
You of all people!

34:49.719 --> 34:52.951
You talk about my friends.
Hah! That's priceless.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.458
What about you
and the Artways secretary?

34:55.525 --> 34:57.721
And the stenographer,
the elevator girl,

34:57.795 --> 34:59.854
the kid in publicity,
the photographer's model...

34:59.931 --> 35:04.459
Do you think they'd look
at you twice if you weren't
the great Mr. Janoth?

35:04.535 --> 35:07.436
Do you think you could
make any woman happy?
Have you lived this long...

35:07.505 --> 35:10.440
without knowing that everybody
laughs at ya behind your back?

35:10.508 --> 35:12.635
You'd be pathetic if you
weren't so disgusting.

35:12.710 --> 35:16.202
You flabby, flabby,
ludicrous, pa... No!

35:31.095 --> 35:33.029
Earl.

35:35.833 --> 35:40.361
Steve,
I've just killed someone.

35:40.438 --> 35:44.670
I've no right to come here,
but I didn't know
where else to go.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.409
Well, she's been
asking for it
for a long time.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.849
She's a regular little comic.
She was one of the most
generous women that ever lived.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.852
Then why did you
kill her?
I don't know, Steve.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.252
I just don't know.

35:58.322 --> 36:02.986
From here I go to my lawyer,
then to prison or the chair.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

36:03.060 --> 36:06.052
Don't be a fool, Earl.
What about
Janoth Publications?

36:06.130 --> 36:10.157
I know. What can I do?
Do you want to fight,
or do you want to quit?

36:10.234 --> 36:14.933
If there's any chance at all,
you know I'll take it.
Of course there's a chance.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.497
You're not the first man
who ever got into a jam.

36:17.575 --> 36:22.205
You've been very discreet
about Pauline. No one knows
about her but you and me.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.740
Now, let's see
what we can work out.
Tell me what happened.

36:26.817 --> 36:29.308
I can't describe that,
Steve.
Try, Earl.

36:29.387 --> 36:33.221
Thirty seconds before,
I didn't intend
anything like it.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.225
I just don't
understand it.

36:35.293 --> 36:40.663
I killed her with some sort
of a sundial she'd picked up
somewhere. Heavy metal.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.495
That's still there.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.502
Where's your hat?

36:45.570 --> 36:48.368
I left that.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.169
All right, Earl.

36:51.242 --> 36:53.267
I'll go over there
and clean things up.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.278
Steve, I'm gratified.

36:55.346 --> 36:59.646
I always thought you wanted
to step into my shoes
at Janoth Publications.

37:01.986 --> 37:04.887
Earl, Janoth Publications
isn't through with you yet.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.367
Who is it?
A husband.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.434
Oh, it's you.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.641
The door's unlocked.

39:22.059 --> 39:25.051
What's a honeymoon
without a husband?
When did that occur to you?

39:25.129 --> 39:28.792
I was detained.
I was so angry when
the train left without you.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.302
It was unforgivable.
It was unforgivable,
your leaving without me.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.032
Was I supposed to wait
at the station
till our golden wedding?

39:35.106 --> 39:39.202
That's what Janoth wanted.
Please listen.
I know the music by heart.

39:39.276 --> 39:41.904
"Once a man
puts his foot down,
they listen to reason.

39:41.979 --> 39:45.471
Things are different now."
But it is different,
ya dope.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.915
Sit down.

39:47.985 --> 39:51.386
I've quit. Quit cold.
For good, forever
and for always.

39:51.455 --> 39:56.222
I can't believe it.
We're unemployed
and penniless.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.989
It's too good
to be true.
Blacklisted for life,

39:59.063 --> 40:00.997
never to work
on a magazine again.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.465
Oh, George,
how wonderful!

40:03.534 --> 40:06.435
How'd it happen to you?
Why didn't you call me?

40:06.504 --> 40:09.234
But, darling, I had
18 million things to do.

40:09.306 --> 40:12.070
You just can't
clean up seven years
in five minutes.

40:12.143 --> 40:16.307
Before I could turn around,
it was 7:00, so I called
the house. Gone.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.507
I'm terribly sorry,
darling.

40:18.582 --> 40:22.143
I was miserable about it.
Were you miserable too?

40:22.219 --> 40:24.687
Miserable?
I was desolate.

40:24.755 --> 40:29.715
It's positively ironic.
I throw away $30,000 a year
and you walk out on me.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.989
I-I tell you,
the bottom fell out.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.030
I walked the streets
like a zombie.

40:34.098 --> 40:38.501
Didn't meet any blonde
fortune tellers on the way?
You're not serious?

40:38.569 --> 40:41.163
Yes, George.
I'm very serious.

40:41.238 --> 40:43.172
I've been thinking
a great deal.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.174
I can stand a lot,
but...

40:45.242 --> 40:47.335
that's one thing
I just couldn't take.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.845
That's something
you'll never have to take.

40:49.914 --> 40:53.077
You're the only blonde
in my life.
I'm a brunette.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.084
You're
the only brunette too.

40:58.155 --> 41:02.285
Anybody know you're here?
Uncle Fred, but he wouldn't
call at this hour.

41:02.359 --> 41:05.726
Anybody know
you're here?
Only Daisy.
I left her a note.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.629
Don't answer it.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.633
Nobody home.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.999
Now, tell me all about it
from the beginning.

41:13.070 --> 41:16.528
Well...

41:16.607 --> 41:18.541
I'll have to.

41:18.609 --> 41:22.511
Hello. Yes, this is Stroud.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.879
Who? Put him on.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.885
Hello, George.
We've got the story
of the year.

41:28.953 --> 41:32.013
It's a natural for you.
What's that?

41:32.089 --> 41:34.683
I said, haven't ya heard?
I've quit.

41:34.758 --> 41:39.218
But this is important.
The payoff man in an enormous
war contract scandal.

41:39.296 --> 41:41.730
Find him and you'll
get a bonus:
Vacation.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.393
six months' vacation,
maybe the Pulitzer Prize.

41:44.468 --> 41:49.064
I've already got the prize.
I'm on a permanent vacation.

41:49.139 --> 41:51.073
He won't listen.

41:54.011 --> 41:57.845
George, Janoth.
I behaved very badly yesterday.

41:57.915 --> 42:02.682
Steve has been remonstrating
with me about it. I can't
blame you for being sore.

42:04.421 --> 42:09.552
As servants of the public,
it is our duty
to hound this man.

42:09.627 --> 42:14.121
Oh, the trail is still fresh.
He was around town
last night with a blonde.

42:14.198 --> 42:18.134
We know they were
at the Van Barth
and some bar called Burt's.

42:20.004 --> 42:24.964
- You know who the girl is?
- No, we don't care about her.
Uh, we're after the man.

42:25.042 --> 42:28.239
Yes. Uh, Jefferson Randolph.

42:28.312 --> 42:30.940
Jefferson Randolph?

42:31.015 --> 42:32.949
No. Never heard of him.

42:33.017 --> 42:36.748
I am not going to rest
until I have exposed
this scoundrel...

42:36.820 --> 42:39.482
if I have to assign every man
in my organization.

42:41.158 --> 42:43.456
I'll grab the next plane,
Mr. Janoth.

42:44.828 --> 42:48.389
George, if you leave now,
I'll never speak to you again.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.297
- Darling, I have to.
- Why?

42:54.138 --> 42:56.231
Well,

42:57.241 --> 43:00.074
Janoth says it's
a war contract scandal,
but that's a blind.

43:00.144 --> 43:02.977
He's trying to find out
who's been playing
around with his girl.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.607
I happen to know the man.
He's a victim of circumstances.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.243
I've got to go back,
keep Janoth from finding him.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.117
It would wreck
the man's life.
Wreck his life?

43:11.188 --> 43:13.122
Well, what about ours?

43:30.841 --> 43:32.866
Good morning, Mr. Janoth.
Good morning, Tom.

43:32.943 --> 43:36.572
Not very much to go on.
Do you think Stroud can do it?

43:36.647 --> 43:40.378
Had even less on Fleming.
We've Van Barth's
and Burt's Place,

43:40.451 --> 43:42.385
provided Pauline
was telling the truth.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.445
She must have been.

43:45.522 --> 43:49.583
You told me there was
a tag on the sundial.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.788
What did you do with that?
Put it back
at Burt's bar.

43:52.863 --> 43:56.822
That's good.
You're sure there was nothing
familiar about this Randolph?

43:56.900 --> 43:59.960
I told you he was in
the shadowy part of the hall.

44:00.037 --> 44:03.529
But he saw you?
He couldn't help it.
I was directly under the light.

44:03.607 --> 44:07.634
Well, perhaps
he doesn't know you.
Everybody knows me.

44:13.317 --> 44:17.219
He was the only one who can
connect me with Pauline.

44:17.287 --> 44:22.020
Except me.
You have a macabre
sense of humor, Steve.

44:26.430 --> 44:28.762
Good morning, Mr. Janoth.
Good morning.

44:28.832 --> 44:31.926
Good morning, Mr. Hagen.
Is Stroud in yet?

44:32.002 --> 44:35.335
Yes, Mr. Janoth.
Send him to Mr. Hagen's office.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.499
You better
talk to him first.
Yes.

44:37.574 --> 44:42.568
And, Steve, we have
to have Randolph before
Pauline's body is found,

44:42.646 --> 44:46.912
before he reads
of the incident
and goes to the police.

44:46.984 --> 44:51.478
It'd be most unpleasant
if he were to insist he saw
me entering her apartment.

44:51.555 --> 44:53.750
I should have
to call him a liar.

45:08.005 --> 45:11.065
Send Mr. Stroud in.
Yes, Mr. Hagen.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.017
George,
we appreciate this.

45:21.085 --> 45:23.019
We know what
it means to you.

45:23.087 --> 45:25.988
It means more to my wife.
She'll get over it.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.958
Let's get started. Earl
told you the man's name:
Jefferson Randolph.

45:30.027 --> 45:32.257
I think it's an alias.
Why?

45:32.329 --> 45:34.490
The kind of business
he's in.

45:34.565 --> 45:38.399
War contract scandals?
Spending the proceeds
last night on a blonde.

45:38.469 --> 45:43.463
Quite an assignment, a guy
spending money on a blonde.
Not quite as bad as that.

45:43.540 --> 45:46.976
We have a vague description
of the man and the names
of two night spots.

45:47.044 --> 45:49.842
Read these.
Throw a staff together.

45:49.913 --> 45:53.474
We want action.
Call on any of the other
magazines for help.

45:53.550 --> 45:57.179
Set up your blackboard,
your regular technique.
You've got a free hand.

45:58.489 --> 46:01.788
One question: Where does
all this information come from?

46:01.859 --> 46:05.022
A... confidential source.
We're pledged not to reveal it.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.029
Why not call in
the authorities?

46:07.097 --> 46:10.191
No, George.
This is an exclusive
between you and me.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.236
And Janoth?
Of course.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.774
Still some in this old
bottle, Bill. Use it up.

46:22.513 --> 46:25.038
Oh, I'm tired and run down.
I need a vacation.

46:25.115 --> 46:27.242
I should take
an ocean voyage.

46:27.317 --> 46:29.808
Have you ever
been abroad, Bill?
It's stimulating.

46:29.887 --> 46:33.084
Different people,
different customs.

46:33.157 --> 46:35.148
Do you know
that in some countries,

46:35.225 --> 46:38.456
after a murderer confesses,
the police let him run...

46:38.529 --> 46:40.497
and shoot him
in the back?

46:41.865 --> 46:44.129
Do you think
this, uh, killer,

46:44.201 --> 46:46.931
this Jefferson Randolph,

46:47.004 --> 46:50.496
could be persuaded
to run when we find him?

46:52.643 --> 46:55.077
His confession
could just as well...

46:55.145 --> 46:59.309
be prepared afterwards and then
submitted to the police.

47:01.552 --> 47:03.486
Justice would be served.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.386
Wonderful story for Crimeways.

47:08.458 --> 47:12.952
Randolph.
Jefferson Randolph.
This is really a tough one.

47:13.030 --> 47:16.090
It appears we're heading
into a blank wall.
We've worked with less before.

47:16.166 --> 47:19.533
Let's check the assignments.
Lily, you and Morton
take the De Witt Hotel.

47:19.603 --> 47:22.128
The De Witt?
The notes said
the Van Barth.

47:22.206 --> 47:26.108
Was it the Van Barth?
Anyway, you're a society couple
out for an afternoon bracer.

47:26.176 --> 47:29.577
That will be a pleasure.
We'll shoot you additional
information as we get it.

47:29.646 --> 47:32.513
Uh, Edwin.
You take Burt's Place.

47:32.583 --> 47:35.177
Don't you think you ought
to pick someone more suitable?

47:35.252 --> 47:39.450
Why? Edwin's smart.
They'd never spot him
for an investigator.

47:39.523 --> 47:42.583
Tony, you and Bert
are the inquiring reporters.

47:42.659 --> 47:45.753
That means you have to check
the doormen, newsboys,
taxicab drivers,

47:45.829 --> 47:48.491
anybody that might
have seen them between
the Van Barth and Burt's Place.

47:48.565 --> 47:51.728
Isn't that a big hunk
of territory?
We'll send somebody to help you.

47:51.802 --> 47:56.262
Nat, you and Morgan and Talbot,
you're the research division.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.900
This guy's name, as I say,
may be Jefferson Randolph.

47:58.976 --> 48:01.069
He's supposed to come
from a wealthy family.

48:01.144 --> 48:03.772
So you'll have to check
the telephone books,
tax records, utility lists,

48:03.847 --> 48:07.943
general business directories...
anything you can think of
for cities within 300 miles.

48:08.018 --> 48:09.417
Now, any questions?

48:09.486 --> 48:13.923
Yeah, can we ask about
the blonde too?
Yes,
you can ask about the blonde.

48:13.991 --> 48:15.982
But don't forget,
it's the man we want,
and only the man.

48:16.059 --> 48:18.584
Suppose you climb
on your horses, huh?

48:18.662 --> 48:22.689
Don't forget to report in
as soon as you get anything.
Roy'll be on the telephones.

48:22.766 --> 48:24.734
George, you didn't
give me an assignment.

48:24.801 --> 48:27.861
You help with the phones.
Get a couple extra installed.
Check.

48:37.614 --> 48:39.639
Oh, Miss Adams.
Yes, sir?

48:39.716 --> 48:41.707
I don't want
to be disturbed.

49:25.095 --> 49:29.657
Operator, I've been trying
to get Butterfield 8-3597
all morning.

49:29.733 --> 49:32.497
Could you check it for me?

49:35.072 --> 49:37.404
It's not out of order?

49:37.474 --> 49:39.704
Thanks.

49:50.387 --> 49:52.787
Burt's Place?
Who is this?

49:52.856 --> 49:55.222
Charlie,
this is George Stroud.
Look...

49:55.292 --> 49:59.319
No, no, it's not
about the fin at all.
Look, is Burt there?

49:59.396 --> 50:02.422
He isn't?
When he comes in,
give him a message for me.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.524
I wasn't there last night.
Get it?

50:04.601 --> 50:07.798
Sure, I got the message.
And about that fin.

50:07.871 --> 50:09.998
I'll pay it back
at the end of the week.

50:10.073 --> 50:13.042
Oh, that's swell
of ya, George.
Good-bye.

50:22.519 --> 50:25.886
No, you don't!
So you're the guy that's
been swipin' my stock.

50:25.956 --> 50:28.481
I was just scrapin'
the stamp off the bottle.

50:28.558 --> 50:31.322
I collect 'em.
Get out of here
and stay out.

50:31.395 --> 50:33.659
Give me another chance.
You had your last chance
on St. Patrick's Day.

50:33.730 --> 50:36.597
But I've got a message for you.
Give it to
the telegraph company!

50:36.666 --> 50:38.691
Okay, I'll go,
but I won't come back!

50:51.448 --> 50:53.541
Hello, Roy? Bert Finch.
I got a lead.

50:53.617 --> 50:56.814
Yeah, a witness
who saw a couple like ours
near Burt's Place.

50:56.887 --> 51:00.687
About, uh, 10:30.

51:00.757 --> 51:03.248
Yeah, and the man had
a picture under his arm.

51:03.326 --> 51:06.261
Of a pair of hands.
Yeah.

51:06.329 --> 51:10.060
Yeah, I've got it.
A painting of a pair of hands.

51:10.133 --> 51:13.034
Hands,
Mr. Cordette?
Hands.

51:13.103 --> 51:16.698
What about descriptions?
Gorgeous, huh?

51:16.773 --> 51:20.140
And the man?
Good. Keep checking.

51:20.210 --> 51:22.235
Finch says that a man
and a gorgeous blonde...

51:22.312 --> 51:24.246
were seen outside
Burt's Place,
10:30 last night.

51:24.314 --> 51:28.250
They were both high.
The man had a painting of
a pair of hands under his arm.

51:28.318 --> 51:30.513
The witness didn't get
a good look at the man.

51:30.587 --> 51:33.522
Finch says he was too busy
staring at the blonde.
That's too bad.

51:33.590 --> 51:36.684
Miss Connely, on the board,
Burt's Place, 10:30.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.751
Oh, George.
Yes, Steve?

51:38.829 --> 51:40.888
Mightn't that be one of your
famous irrelevant clues?

51:40.964 --> 51:43.524
What?
The picture.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.659
Yes, yes, it might
at that.

51:45.735 --> 51:47.760
Better get busy.

51:47.838 --> 51:50.636
If he had it under his arm,
he probably bought it
somewhere nearby.

51:50.707 --> 51:53.005
I'll assign a man
to check it.

51:53.076 --> 51:56.136
Assign a dozen men. Check every
art store and antique shop
in the neighborhood.

51:56.213 --> 51:58.181
Maybe he paid for it
with a check.

51:58.248 --> 52:01.274
Maybe somebody
will remember the picture.
Yeah, you're right.

52:12.362 --> 52:14.922
As of 12:17, the clue chart
reads as follows.

52:14.998 --> 52:19.196
"Name: Jefferson Randolph.
Appearance: Tall, medium build,
black hair.

52:19.269 --> 52:23.035
Clothes: Single-breasted,
gray suit, well-tailored,
blue tie.

52:23.106 --> 52:27.065
Age: About 35.
Frequents: Van Barth
and Burt's Place.

52:27.144 --> 52:31.604
Habits: Collects paintings.
Character: Questionable."

52:31.681 --> 52:36.380
Hello.
No, this is Kislav.

52:36.453 --> 52:39.547
Yeah, go ahead.
Mort Spaulding at the Van Barth
has something.

52:39.623 --> 52:43.491
They remember them here,
but the bartender who
served them hasn't come in yet.

52:43.560 --> 52:48.429
I've found one very
charming lead though.
The hatcheck lady.

52:48.498 --> 52:51.092
He's been in here before,
but with his wife.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.569
No, she can't add anything
to our description,
but she remembers his hat.

52:54.638 --> 52:59.132
Brown felt hat
with a feather in the band.

52:59.209 --> 53:01.473
Anything else?

53:01.545 --> 53:03.604
Okay, stick around
till the bartender comes.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.739
Guess you better put that
on the board, huh?
Yeah.

53:05.815 --> 53:08.010
Miss Connely,
put that on the board.

53:09.452 --> 53:12.478
Brown felt hat
with a feather in the band.

53:17.694 --> 53:22.358
We have located five Randolphs.
One in Forest Hills,
one in Brooklyn.

53:22.432 --> 53:24.832
Assign a man to each one.
Find out where
they were last night.

53:24.901 --> 53:27.096
Tell 'em it's a poll
on America's nightlife.

53:27.170 --> 53:29.161
Yeah, right.

53:30.373 --> 53:33.206
George, we've got a break.
Finch traced the picture.

53:33.276 --> 53:35.244
An antique shop
on 3rd Avenue.

53:35.312 --> 53:38.611
The man paid $30 for it.
It was painted by an artist
named Patterson.

53:38.682 --> 53:40.616
Sounds as if he might
be a collector, huh?
Yeah.

53:40.684 --> 53:42.618
What are you going
to do about it?
Hadn't we better check?

53:42.686 --> 53:45.211
What's the name
of the chief critic on Artways?
Right!

53:45.288 --> 53:48.553
What do you mean, right?
Is his name Klausmeyer
or something?

53:48.625 --> 53:51.059
I'll phone him and send him
out to see Patterson.
Good.

53:53.663 --> 53:55.654
Say, George.

53:57.634 --> 54:00.159
This painting.
It's a Patterson, isn't it?

54:00.237 --> 54:02.762
That's what it says.
I got others at home.

54:02.839 --> 54:06.832
Why don't you
interview Patterson?
Randolph may be a collector.

54:06.910 --> 54:09.970
No. The way we're going,
we'll have this guy
in a couple of hours.

54:10.046 --> 54:12.514
Maybe sooner. You go ahead
and keep a check on things.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.495
Amazing how much junk
gets in these things.

54:34.571 --> 54:37.199
Miss Adams.

54:37.274 --> 54:40.471
Yes, sir?
Try and keep this thing
clean for me, will you?

54:45.048 --> 54:48.279
Good morning, young lady.
Beat it!

54:48.351 --> 54:50.683
Is your mother at home?
I said, beat it!

54:50.754 --> 54:53.348
Who is it, Rosa?
Someone trying
to steal the mail!

54:53.423 --> 54:55.618
No, no, I was just...
Yes?

54:55.692 --> 54:59.093
Miss Patterson?
I'm Don Klausmeyer
from Artways magazine.

54:59.162 --> 55:01.027
Yes?

55:01.097 --> 55:06.000
Oh, yes, didn't you review
my show in '41?
I think I did.

55:06.069 --> 55:09.232
Oh, come in,
Mr. Klausman.
"Klausmeyer."

55:09.306 --> 55:12.434
I've been planning
to kill you for years.

55:12.509 --> 55:14.807
Drop those, cherub,
and I'll break
both your arms.

55:14.878 --> 55:17.142
Straight ahead.

55:20.083 --> 55:23.018
Are all these your little ones,
Miss Patterson?
More or less.

55:23.086 --> 55:26.886
That one's Ralph's,
my first husband.
Drank himself to death.

55:26.956 --> 55:29.254
That one's Frederick's.
Lost at sea.

55:29.326 --> 55:34.263
I had a third husband.
He... And the twins
are Mike's.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.357
Your present husband?
Would be
if I could find him.

55:37.434 --> 55:40.335
Oh, don't sit there.
No, no, it collapses.

55:40.403 --> 55:42.337
Won't you come into
my workshop?

55:42.405 --> 55:44.600
Don't be afraid.

55:44.674 --> 55:47.142
A glass of sherry?
No, no, no,
thank you.

55:47.210 --> 55:49.804
Sit down, Mr. Klaus...
"Meyer."

55:49.879 --> 55:52.143
Oh.

55:52.215 --> 55:54.183
Another review?
No.

55:54.250 --> 55:58.084
Our organization,
the Janoth Publications,
is trying to find someone,

55:58.154 --> 56:00.247
possibly a collector
of your pictures.

56:00.323 --> 56:03.019
So have I
for 15 years.

56:03.093 --> 56:07.257
This man bought one
of your pictures last night in
an antique shop on 3rd Avenue.

56:07.330 --> 56:09.696
Oh, a pair of hands?

56:09.766 --> 56:13.133
Yes, how did you know?
I was there,
trying to buy them myself.

56:13.203 --> 56:16.229
Then you saw this man.
Can you describe him?

56:16.306 --> 56:20.538
Oh, yes.
Smug, self-satisfied.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.579
Uh, symmetrical features.

56:23.646 --> 56:27.639
I could draw him
for you.
That would be wonderful.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.981
Of course, I should
like to be paid.

56:30.053 --> 56:34.285
Of course.
How would $100 be?

56:34.357 --> 56:36.552
And of course,
the same for the blonde.

56:36.626 --> 56:38.958
You mean, you don't
know the blonde?
Uh, no.

56:39.028 --> 56:42.623
She's a model that used
to pose for that horrible
fashion rag of yours,

56:42.699 --> 56:45.031
uh, Styleways.

56:45.101 --> 56:49.561
I wanted to use her once
for a painting, Avarice.

56:49.639 --> 56:52.403
You know her name?
Oh, yes, yes.

56:52.475 --> 56:55.308
Um, Pauline York.
Pauline York!

56:55.378 --> 56:57.812
What a scoop!
Thank you!

56:57.881 --> 57:01.214
Oh, Mr. Klausburger.
"Klausmeyer."

57:01.284 --> 57:03.844
What about the sketches?

57:03.920 --> 57:07.219
Check with George Stroud
at Crimeways magazine.

57:09.759 --> 57:11.886
Oh, sorry.

57:11.961 --> 57:14.156
Oh, Penelope.

57:14.230 --> 57:18.223
You forgot to put away
your roller skates.

57:19.469 --> 57:21.528
The board certainly
is coming along fine.

57:21.604 --> 57:25.734
I'd say we're getting a pretty
good picture of the man.
Drinker, collects paintings.

57:25.809 --> 57:28.505
Eccentric.
Clock phobia,
glib talker.

57:28.578 --> 57:30.978
Ladies' man.
And married.

57:31.047 --> 57:33.379
How'd you like your wife
to see that, George?
My wife?

57:33.450 --> 57:36.578
Well, any wife.
She'd start shooting before
you could open your mouth.

57:36.653 --> 57:38.678
I'll take it.

57:38.755 --> 57:43.055
Hello? Yes, Don,
this is George.

57:43.126 --> 57:48.223
What? You have?
Who is she?

57:48.298 --> 57:53.099
Pauline York.
She modeled for Styleways once.
Patterson recognized her.

57:53.169 --> 57:55.603
She was in the antique shop
trying to buy that
picture herself.

57:55.672 --> 57:57.765
York was with a man
who outbid her.

57:57.841 --> 57:59.775
I'm going over
to see York right now.

57:59.843 --> 58:04.576
Don?
Now, wait a minute...
You take over.

58:04.647 --> 58:06.638
What is it?
New lead.

58:17.961 --> 58:19.895
"It Might Have
Happened To You,"

58:19.963 --> 58:23.592
the "Safety First" program
is on the air.

58:23.666 --> 58:26.396
Presented as a public service,
"It Might Have Happened To You"...

58:26.469 --> 58:28.801
comes to you each week
from a different American city.

58:28.872 --> 58:33.036
Dramatized from real life,
"It Might Have Happened To You"...

58:33.109 --> 58:36.510
hopes to reduce
the appalling casualty rate
on our highways and byways.

58:38.114 --> 58:40.674
This week,
tragedy strikes in Elksburg.

58:51.661 --> 58:56.564
A flourishing town in the
Midwest, where we hear the story
of Mr. Bundy's extra little nip.

58:56.633 --> 59:01.297
The Elksburg Municipal
Orchestra opens now
with an American medley.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.837
Hello, Don.
George, have you
seen Miss York?

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:18.210
Yeah, I saw Miss York.
Got all the information.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.580
Who's the guy?
Jefferson Randolph,
publisher from Pittsburgh.

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:25.712
He's got his
own plant down there.
I want you to hop on a plane.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:28.518
Find out all you can
about him.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:34.930
Check the chamber of commerce,
talk to the mayor. Somebody'll
know where he is... Taxi!

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:37.933
Then call us back, understand?
I'm an art editor,
not an investigator.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.970
Janoth's orders, Don.
Go ahead. La Guardia Field.

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:44.302
But my toothbrush and pajamas?
Put it on your expense account.
Go on. Beat it!

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:54.348
Oh, doorman. Do you
happen to know Mr. Janoth?
Yes, sir?

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:57.944
Mr. Janoth? Sure.
Fine fellow. He gave me
a wristwatch last Christmas.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.889
Didn't happen to see him
last night around 1:00 or 1:30?
I quit at 12:00.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.017
How about
the telephone operator
or the elevator boy?

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.186
Everybody knocks off
at 12:00.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.526
By the way,
does Miss York have a maid?

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:12.125
Sure, but you won't find her.
She started her vacation
last Monday.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:15.796
You sure?
I got a postcard
from her from Milwaukee.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:21.969
Oh, where would you get a cab
around 1:00 in the morning?

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:24.240
Two blocks.
Thanks.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:27.646
Tails.
A dollar and a half.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.742
Heads.
A dollar-six bits
I owe you.

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.346
Five I owe in return
for a little information.
You got a deal, mister.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.357
Who's on duty here
after midnight?

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.393
Nobody.
Not an all-night stand.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.190
That's right.
Nearest one's on 5th Avenue,
two blocks from here.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.629
Thanks.
Half of that's mine.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.429
"April 4, 1936.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:50.336
Crowd catcher at the
Greenwich Village Sidewalk Show.
Louise Patterson's Birthright."

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.102
Research dug it up.
Decadent-looking thing.

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:56.304
Yes, but I can use it as bait.
Offer a reward for the original.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.212
Ads in the afternoon papers,
big-scale reproductions
of the picture.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:03.013
A lost masterpiece.
Randolph or somebody's
bound to bite.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:06.544
Do that at once.
Get me Sheekman in
Press Relations and Paul Bell.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.556
Yes, Mr. Hagen.

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:11.718
A thousand dollars?
Don't fool around with this.
Ten thousand.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.854
How about the stand in front
of Scanlon's Drug Store?
No.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:18.697
The Parkway Hotel?
The Ashendon Library?

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:21.566
Say, there's a stand
by an all-night hamburger joint
three blocks down.

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:24.970
How about that?
I could use a hamburger.
Thanks.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.141
That your cab out there?
Yeah, you want it?

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:36.117
No, not exactly.
How many drivers
use this stand?

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.176
Just me and Kowalski.
Uh-huh.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:41.189
Who was on last night
between 1:00 and 2:00?

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.919
You trying to find out about
a fare Kowalski had then?
Yeah.

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.223
He was tellin' me.
Half-crazy the guy was.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.661
No hat, mumbling to himself.
Gave a 20 for a 12-block haul.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:51.222
Where'd he haul him to?
Didn't say.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.235
Where does Kowalski live?
Somewhere around here.
Don't know exactly.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.294
First name's Casimir,
if that's any help.
No, not much.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:58.397
He'll be here at 8:00.
He will?

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:02.069
You have him call me, will you?
Tell him there's
another 20 in it.

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.470
Thanks.

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:08.013
Thank you, Betty.
Thank you, Mr. Stroud.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.814
I certainly wish
I could find that picture.
Uh-huh.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:29.133
Time: eight hours.
In manpower, the efforts
of 46 employees.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:32.072
It results in enough
information about this man...
his whimsicalities,

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.871
his clean-cut features,
his charming manners,

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:39.040
his penchant for green mint
stingers and modern paintings...
to write his biography.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:42.881
Mr. Stroud, where is he?
That I don't know.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:46.217
I've placed the blonde though.
Her name's Pauline York.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:49.816
How did you discover that?
Klausmeyer and I just
came from her apartment.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:53.953
Did you talk with her?
I couldn't very well
on account of she was dead.

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.998
That doesn't seem
to be much of a shocker.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:02.303
Why do you think we've been
conducting the search?

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.464
How did you find out
she was dead?

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.737
Her maid discovered her
this morning,
telephoned Steve.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:12.372
Telephoned Steve?
Yes, she was
a protégée of his.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.940
Why didn't the maid
call the police?
Steve asked her not to.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.145
He's been rather generous
with her of late.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:21.884
We wanted to trap
Randolph ourselves,
then hand him over.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.926
Feather in our caps.
Yeah.

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:27.724
Yeah,
but where's all this dope
on Randolph come from?

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.265
The maid.
She heard them
talking, quarreling.

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:34.463
That's what makes you
think he killed her.
Who else could it be?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.335
Well, how about Steve,
for instance?

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.738
She was his protégée.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:42.903
That's a very strange
suggestion, Stroud.

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:46.039
I telephoned over to his home,
spoke to him at 12:30.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:48.845
Within seven minutes
of the time the murder
took place.

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.386
How do you know?
The clock broke
in the struggle.

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:54.651
Then you've been
in her apartment?
The maid reported it.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.056
She's quite
a detective.
What is
the matter with you?

01:04:57.126 --> 01:05:00.357
I just can't understand
why you're so sure
Randolph killed her.

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.294
Suppose an investigation
proved him innocent?

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:05.163
An investigation?
What sort of an investigation?

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.600
An inquiry around
the apartment house.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.366
Witnesses who saw somebody else
enter or leave.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:12.532
You have witnesses?

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.634
No, not yet,
but I shall have to look for them,

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:18.703
that is, unless you decide
to let the matter drop.

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:22.411
You're going to great lengths
to protect this Randolph.

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.419
Just trying to keep
an open mind.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:29.288
Very open.
Have you some inside
knowledge of this matter?

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.097
Yes?

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:41.227
Oh, Cordette.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:46.241
You have?
Oh, excellent!
Excellent!

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:50.769
You can forget
about your witnesses.
We have our man.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:53.644
He was just seen
entering the building.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:57.743
I want an emergency order
issued, all exits blocked,
the building closed.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.254
Nobody's to leave
unless identified.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.883
You take charge.
Yes, sir.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.759
Stroud? Now!

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:15.564
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:19.233
but all exits have been closed,
except the main door.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:23.142
We will try to inconvenience you
as little as possible.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:26.545
If everybody will proceed
in the direction of the desk,

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:29.379
we will try
to get you out quickly.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:31.920
Just a matter
of identification.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.855
Just a matter of identification.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:38.382
Your cooperation
will be appreciated.
Thank you.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:41.089
Everybody on this side
of the rope, please.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.131
Kindly form a single line.
Only routine.

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:46.259
You'll be out of here
in a couple of minutes.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.825
Thank you.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:51.771
Nobody leaves the building
except through the front.
Mr. Janoth's orders.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:56.835
Have you sent
for the other witnesses?
Not yet.

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.779
Get them immediately.
Get Patterson and the people
at the Van Barth.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:03.341
I've stationed the antique
dealer in the lobby.
Get me the Van Barth bar.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:07.378
We have 50 men stationed,
Mr. Stroud.

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:12.291
If the man gets out,
it'll be a miracle.
It certainly will.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:15.524
Yeah? I'll find out
about that. Mr. Hagen?
Yes?

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.828
The people are raising
Cain in the lobby.
They don't like being delayed.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.095
Kislav, go down
and use a little diplomacy.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:22.160
Make sure no one leaves
without being passed
by the antique dealer.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.331
Morgan, Talbot,
you go with him.

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:26.841
We're taking care
of that.

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:30.902
Yeah, Orlin?
Burt's Place.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.005
Nothing at all?

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.108
I find all this
very distasteful.

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:39.780
An extremely sordid place.
Disreputable clientele.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:43.552
Did you ask any questions?
Well, ask some.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.424
Very well.
If I must, I must.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:54.134
Thank you very much for
letting me use the telephone.
Here's your nickel.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:04.212
Do you mind if I ask
a civil question, bud?
Not at all.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.147
What's the matter with
the public library today?
Did they raise the dues?

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:12.916
See here, my friend.
Now, don't get sore about it.
You just arouse my curiosity.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:16.479
Sitting here all afternoon
with one limeade and two books,

01:08:16.559 --> 01:08:18.493
and you don't even
play the game.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.624
Child's play.
And I don't like your limeade.
I'm just waiting for someone.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:26.224
And who might that be?
I don't know.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:30.636
You don't know?
It's quite simple.
He's a friend of a friend of mine.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:35.268
I've never seen him,
but I understand he's a habitué.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:38.006
He was in here recently
with a stunning blonde,

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.412
that is, if you think
blondes are stunning.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.008
You wouldn't be
his brother-in-law
by any chance?

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:46.612
You might be a bill collector.
What do you want with this guy?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:51.786
It's quite personal.
I'm told he talks about clocks...
green clocks.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:57.520
Green clocks, you say?
You know him?
Can you describe him for me?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.591
Oh, that'll be easy.
Yeah, sure we could.

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:04.901
'Cause he's
a very remarkable fellow.
Yes, a very remarkable fellow.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.908
Why should this man
be in the building...

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:09.240
unless he is employed here,
or at least known?

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.471
You correlate your information.
We can identify him.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:14.037
Out of 3,000 employees
and 2,000 sightseers a day?

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:17.950
Nothing is impossible.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.216
Hello? Yeah, Edwin.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.554
You have?
Orlin at Burt's Place.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:26.823
Says he's got
a complete description.
Shoot, Edwin.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:29.660
Last night with a blonde.
Two witnesses.

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:32.256
Okay, let's have
the description.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:37.294
Built-up heels,
cauliflower ear,
brown toupee.

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:39.466
That's right,
a brown toupee.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.272
And don't forget
the glass eye.
It's the left eye.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.642
Glass eye,
the left one.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.511
Glass eye?
Hold it.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:49.517
Edwin says...
I heard.

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:52.486
Anybody know a man
with a glass eye?
What's that idiot's name?

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.546
Edwin Orlin.
Fire him.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:01.792
Mr. Hagen, I can't do it.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:06.164
Orlin, this is Mr. Hagen.
Yes, Orlin, we heard
your description.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:23.313
Superior Cab Company?
This is George Stroud
at Crimeways magazine.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:27.014
I'm trying to get hold
of one of your drivers,
Casimir Kowalski.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:30.149
He has no phone?
How about his address?

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:35.260
16 East 31st?
Thank you.

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:42.332
Louise Patterson to see you.
I'm pleased to see that
somebody likes my work.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.567
I've been an admirer
of yours for years,
Mrs. Patterson.

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:51.473
Are you Mr. Stroud?
I'm afraid so.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:56.442
Well, I should like
to earn my money.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.319
That codfish,
Mr. Klaus...
Klausmeyer.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.415
Yes, he said
that you'd pay $100...

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:07.326
for a sketch of the man
who bought my painting.

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:12.432
Then somebody else called
and said that you'd
give me another 50...

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:17.996
if I'd come down here
and identify him,
plus the cab fare.

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:23.409
That's $151.55
and a 10-cent tip.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:27.415
I'll give you a cash voucher.
Yes, the cashier will pay you.
I'll get a messenger.

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:36.085
Shall I start
the sketch now?
That won't be necessary.

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:40.595
Never mind, Mr. Stroud.
I've few enough collectors
without sending one to jail.

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.756
What did you do?
Oh, never mind.

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:47.131
With all that hue and cry
downstairs, it must be
something terribly lurid.

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:50.171
But I don't mind.
My agent says that I
shall make a fortune...

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:53.402
on the strength of that
lost masterpiece story.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:57.673
Oh, my goodness.
This says $500.

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:02.547
I said I was an admirer.
You didn't sound that way
last night, bidding against me.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.985
By the way, what did you do
with my picture?
I took it home.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:11.186
Under the circumstances,
don't you think it would
be safer with me?

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.353
Let's discuss that later.

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.590
Right now, I have to go
find a taxicab driver.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.326
Thank you. Cordette!

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:23.332
Here's the man
who'll cash your voucher.
Thank you.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:28.399
You understand
we can't pay you the money
until you finish the picture.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:31.776
Oh.
Finish the picture.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:35.408
Naturally.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:39.181
I'll start
the sketch now.

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:53.161
Just a minute.
Oh, it's you, Mr. Stroud.

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:58.195
Just out for a sandwich, boys.
Nobody's to leave unless
identified in the lobby.

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:01.709
Ah, good work.
Keep on the beam.

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:56.063
Mr. Stroud isn't here.
Will Pittsburgh speak
to someone else?

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.065
I was disconnected
from the Van Barth.

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:00.431
May I look
at the sketch now?
Not yet. It isn't finished.

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:02.436
A slippery character,
Mr. Randolph.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.369
Glib talker,
ladies' man, playboy.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.932
I could almost believe that
he was my fourth husband, Mike.
He was a playboy too.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.205
Coffee, Mrs. Stroud?
No, thank you.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.771
I'm sorry, Operator.
Please ask Mr. Klausmeyer
to speak to someone else.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:17.216
Mr. Klausmeyer won't
speak to anyone else?
You tell Mr. Klausmeyer...

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.948
George,
a collect call from Pittsburgh.
Hello, darling.

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.923
I knew you wouldn't stay away.
Not after what I found
in our bedroom.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.391
Found in our bedroom?
Yes, in our bedroom.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.294
I can explain
everything, dear.
All I want to know is...

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.524
In my office, dear.
Family quarrels should
be held in private.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:33.193
Family quarrels?
George,
the call from Pittsburgh.

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.862
Refuse the charges.
And a fine pickle, Hagen.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:39.101
Vacation busted up,
marriage on the rocks.
How am I going to explain?

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:42.166
If he can explain,
Mrs. Stroud,
you have a good man.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.374
Oh, darling,
if you only knew what
I've been through today.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.648
Take your hands off me,
Jefferson Randolph.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.712
You see, I've been reading
that blackboard too.

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:57.054
But, darling,
it's a long, long story.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:59.821
Yes, I know.
All about wrecking
an innocent man's life.

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:04.423
Please listen to me.
Don't start making accusations
until you know the true facts.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.991
I was talking with
the Van Barth, the bar.

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.765
I was disconnect...
Oh, hello, Lily?

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:13.501
The bartender just came in.
He says that Randolph spilled
a drink on the blonde.

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.634
It was a stinger
with green mint.

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:18.703
She mopped it up
with his handkerchief and put
the handkerchief in her purse.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.442
The most horrible drink
I ever had in my life.
That's right. Kept it.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:25.214
I was shaking,
but I just couldn't take it...
Please!

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:29.223
Just a moment. I'm talking.
As I was drinking it...
Will you shut up?

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.782
Shh. The lady is talking.
No, no, not you.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.193
Bring the bartender with you.
We're waiting.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.824
Lily says the blonde
took a handkerchief
from the gentleman.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.801
Might have
a laundry mark on it.
That's interesting.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:43.167
Now, if we could only
get that handkerchief.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.229
I'd better put that
on the blackboard.

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.974
Yes?

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.982
Mr. Cordette to see you.
Send him in.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.553
Mr. Hagen,
Mr. Janoth wants you downstairs.
It's very important.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.421
Thank you.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:07.326
And so help me,
the first I knew she was dead
was this afternoon.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:10.832
Why didn't you call the police?
And spend the next
90 years in jail?

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:14.699
Janoth'll have lots of alibis.
Bill, Hagen and a dozen
other people, if necessary.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.705
Me... All I got is myself.
And that taxi driver.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:22.005
Or did you invent him?
Could I invent a name
like Casimir Kowalski?

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:25.535
You could invent anything.
"Miserable, desolate.

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:29.209
Walked the streets like
a zombie." And all the time
you were with that...

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:32.117
But I called the cab company,
got his address,
even wrote it down.

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:35.588
But I can't
get out of here.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:40.293
Yes?
Stand by, George.
Mr. Janoth wants to speak to you.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:44.264
Right, Steve.
If I get out of this jam,
I'm going back to West Virginia.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.528
George, if I could
just believe it.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.935
I'll cover church socials,
write obituaries,
set type, anything.

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:54.408
That would be wonderful.
But you won't.

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:57.411
Yes, sir?
George,
I want this man smoked out.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:17:00.710
Use the guards.
Mobilize everyone.
Start a floor-by-floor search.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.977
Yes, sir.
I'll put O'Brien
right on it.

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.281
I want you to follow through
in person, you understand me?

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.788
Yes, I understand.
Georgette.

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:14.588
Georgette!
She just left.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.832
This way, boys.
Take this corridor first.

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.966
You take the one
to the left.
Any luck?

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.034
Nothing yet.
Keep it up.

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:42.914
Stroud, are you up here?

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.425
The antique dealer
wants to see you.

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.735
George?

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.597
He must be somewhere.
You wait here.
I'll find him.

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:12.211
You!
It's not what
you think it is.

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:15.450
Take it easy. Keep calm.
Somebody's been murdered,
that's all.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.549
Murder!
Aaah!

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:27.098
Oh, there you are, George.
The antique dealer
wants to know...

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.498
Now, what happened
to him?
Haven't seen him.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:33.063
I told him to wait.
How stupid can a guy get?

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:35.075
Let's keep looking.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.711
Cordette!
Miss Patterson's picture,
where is it?

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.715
She hasn't
finished it yet,
Mr. Janoth.

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:44.013
I asked for a sketch,
not a mural.
Did somebody call me?

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:46.554
Yes.
Mr. Janoth wants to see
the picture right now.

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.714
Oh, of course.
Would you like it
in oil?

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.156
No, no, madam.
I'll see it
just as it is.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.328
Come along,
come along,
come along.

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:03.501
I think I've captured
his mood rather successfully,
don't you?

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:07.064
Mr. Janoth, sir.

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:10.373
Here's the antique dealer.
He says Randolph jumped him
on the fifth floor.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.970
Murder, he said.
A murder case.
Did you get a look at him?

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:15.846
Enormous. I fought.
I struggled. No use.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.851
Wild glare
in his eyes.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:21.116
Warn everyone.
Authorize them to shoot
if necessary.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:24.124
The man's a maniac.
Tell O'Brien and
the guards downstairs.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.353
Yes, Mr. Hagen.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.887
Yeah? Oh.

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.730
They've finished
on nine, Mr. Janoth.
I've sent for George Stroud.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.861
Tell them
to keep moving.
Better keep moving.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:39.373
Mr. Janoth,
here are the witnesses
from the Van Barth.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:41.500
Miss Thomas,
the hatcheck lady.
How do you do?

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.510
Mr. Kolbas,
the bartender.
Delighted.

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.910
Gentleman and ladies,
Janoth Publications...

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.972
are extremely grateful
for your help.

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:50.017
You may not realize it,
but when we apprehend this man,

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:53.054
you will have done
your duty as citizens of your community.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:56.682
Oh, Mr. Stroud,
be careful. This guy's
a dangerous maniac.

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.726
We just got orders
to shoot to kill.

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.961
I have authorized two rewards
of $ 1,000 each.

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:13.098
One for the person identifying
our man, and the other for...

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:16.372
- What's the matter?
- The man! He was right there!

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.371
Oh!

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:27.013
George!
Come on. This way.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:33.453
He might carry
a gun.
Yeah. Call the cops.

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:36.759
Get going, boys!

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.660
In here.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.908
Where have you been?
That taxi cab driver.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.909
You got him?
Uh-uh. He's gone.

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:51.241
He and his wife came in
for a sudden legacy,
the neighbors said.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:56.341
How do you like that?
Sudden legacy from old Grandpa
Janoth. That's all I needed.

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.579
What are you doing?
I'm gonna call
the police.

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:01.486
And turn me in?
It's better than
having you shot.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.616
Come on.
Oh, George, I heard
what those guards said.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.627
They called you a maniac.

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.566
Why did you ever
have anything to do
with that woman?

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.660
But I told you,
I didn't.

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:19.434
There must be some way
out of this mess.
If I could only think.

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.806
Give me a cigarette.
I haven't got one.
We could use one of Hagen's.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:27.281
Maybe I should go to Janoth,
try and make some sort
of a deal.
Here you are.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.476
Let me see that.
It was in the box.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.213
Well, well.
What do you mean,
"Well, well"?

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.221
This is mine.
It was in Pauline's purse.

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.190
There you go again.
Pauline.
How did Hagen get it?

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.693
Well, she certainly
got around, didn't she?

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.786
He claimed he was
never up there.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.726
Why don't we pin
this job on Hagen?

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.735
They've been so busy
covering up Janoth,
they've left Hagen wide open.

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:53.540
We'll put him in such
a hole, he'll have to
implicate Janoth.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.207
Hello, Burt's Place?
This is George Stroud.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:03.217
Let me speak
to the President.
President?

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:06.118
President McKinley.
George, are you sure
you're all right?

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.153
Stroud, are you in
my office?

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:16.720
Mr. Janoth wants to see you
in your office at once.

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:19.130
George, are you there?

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.259
Talk to this guy.
Get him up here fast.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.327
He's a radio actor,
a friend of mine.
Where are you going?

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:27.034
Into retirement.
When you get him, call me
at extension 381.
All right.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:29.872
I can't find Stroud
at the moment.
Then you take charge.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.880
Round everybody up.
Make a mass search
of the top floor.

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:43.385
Get the right driver?
Five thousand enough?
Good man.

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:09.041
Superior Cab Company?
This is Stroud
of Crimeways again.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.943
Listen, did Kowalski,
one of your drivers,

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:14.345
make a record
of his fares last night?

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:16.884
About 1:30.
Yeah, Kowalski.

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.620
Yeah, 1:20 will do.

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:24.385
He did?
What was the address?

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:27.189
323 Sutton Place?
Thanks.

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:38.032
"Hagen, Joseph.

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:43.175
Joseph,
Stanley, Stephen.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:45.212
Stephen Hagen.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.578
323 Sutton Place."

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.196
Two hundred
and fifty people,

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.128
twelve hours,
forty-three minutes...

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.133
Earl, the clock
has stopped.
What's that?

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:09.193
The clock
has stopped.
So has this one.

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:23.474
Why shouldn't it stop?
What's the matter with that?

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.485
You issued orders never
to stop the clocks.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:29.182
Why shouldn't it stop for once?
It's a mechanical thing.
It can go wrong, can't it?

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:42.296
It started again.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.600
This one
started again too.

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:46.731
Steve, this hasn't
happened in 12 years.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:51.472
Bill, go downstairs.
See if there's anyone
inside the clock.

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.562
George, where
have you been?
Never mind.

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:57.598
We gotta work fast
before that thug
gets out of the elevator.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.599
Who?
What elevator?
I'll tell you later.

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.532
Look, Mac...
Yeah, thanks.
I came as soon as I could.

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:03.593
What do
you want?
Wait a minute.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.201
Is Mr. Janoth there?
This is George Stroud.

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:11.404
Janoth speaking.
I'm in Hagen's office,
Mr. Janoth.

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:15.074
I've nailed our man.
He'll be here as soon as
you and Hagen can get here.

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:18.141
Good work.
We'll be right up.

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:21.154
Have someone find Bill.
Tell him to come to
my office at once.

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.698
Earl, they'll send up Bill
as soon as they find him.

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:40.707
We'd better go in
and see what Stroud
has for us.

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:47.375
Mr. Janoth.
George, is this
the, uh, man...

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.973
No, this is Inspector Regan
of the homicide detail.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.349
Mr. Earl Janoth,
Mr. Steve Hagen.
How do you do?

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.354
Mr. Hagen.
How do you do?

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.356
Inspector, would you mind
stepping outside a moment?

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:59.450
I give you my solemn word
nothing irregular will occur.

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:05.529
That Hagen fella...
I've seen him
somewhere before.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.467
He's editor in chief here.
Let's try
these two rooms.

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:14.742
Stroud,
I thought you understood
this was confidential.

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.039
This is my wife.
She's been helping me.
I beg your pardon.

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:19.204
I'm talking about the police.
You were told to keep them out.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.249
Not until we had
the murderer. I'm afraid
it's gonna be a shock.

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.716
Shock?
Our man
is Mr. Hagen.

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:32.890
Uh, George, this is
a very serious charge.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.258
I wouldn't be making it
if I didn't have the evidence.

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:38.264
Evidence? Why,
the witnesses have all
seen me, talked to me.

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:41.961
I'm not saying you're Jefferson
Randolph, but nevertheless,
he's the murderer.

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.596
Why should I
kill Pauline?
Blackmail.

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:47.607
He's been giving her money
by check. The bank
will verify that.

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:50.337
Ridiculous.
Is it?

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:54.180
Cigarette?
Uh, not now.

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:56.273
Go ahead, Steve.
You need a smoke.

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:58.841
Thank you, no.
You're afraid to open
the box. Why?

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.412
Because I found something
in here, hidden away.

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:06.119
The handkerchief that
Miss York got from Randolph
at the Van Barth.

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:10.221
Notice the green stains. Where
would he get it except from
the purse in her apartment?

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.266
The maid might have
brought it up here.

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.733
The maid's been away on vacation.
She's been gone a week.

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:17.965
Link number three:
the taxi driver who took you
from Pauline's apartment.

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.973
I don't seem
to see him here.

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:22.635
He was bribed
to go away. I went to
his home and found out.

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.544
But I've got the address
he took you to from
the cab company's files.

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:31.210
And it's 323 Sutton Place.
That's Hagen's residence.

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:34.948
There's your evidence,
Mr. Janoth.
It'll stand up in court.

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:38.617
I doubt that, George.
I think you've had
a brainstorm.

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.923
Anybody could've taken
a cab to my address,

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.520
or have planted
that handkerchief
in my cigarette box.

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:46.761
As for the maid,
I think I can produce her
if necessary.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:49.564
Earl saw her this morning.
Didn't you, Earl?

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:54.971
- Of course I did.
- I'm afraid your case won't hold water.

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.602
We'll see what they say
about that at headquarters.

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.704
Darling, would you ask
Inspector Regan to come in?

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.408
All right.

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.678
We've just about covered
the floor, Mr. Cordette.

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:09.621
Inspector.
Only the executive
offices are left.

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:15.490
I'm sorry to have to do this,
Steve. There's your murderer,
Inspector.

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.498
"Inspector"? Why, I've
seen him cadging drinks
at Burt's Place.

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:22.024
A broken-down
radio actor.

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:24.594
George, I'm beginning
to get an idea.

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.663
Maybe some of the witnesses
should take a look at you.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:30.507
Just a minute, you.
So you've seen me cadging
drinks at Burt's Place?

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:33.877
Well, I just remembered
seeing you at Burt's Place
late last night,

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.882
sneaking that sundial
back into Burt's collection.

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:38.214
"Sundial"?
Yeah. Didn't think
we saw it.

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.481
Had it under his coat.
The murder weapon,

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:42.716
and witnesses who saw him
try to dispose of it.

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:46.886
That wraps it up, Mr. Janoth.
Now we'll try a real cop.
Well, Earl?

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:51.989
Steve, I know how you
feel about me and about
my organization.

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:55.263
You're the most loyal employee
I've ever had.

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:57.861
I'm not going
to let you down, Steve.

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.703
I'll put every resource
we have at your disposal.

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:05.007
We'll fight this through
for you, no matter how long
it takes or how much it costs.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.843
You're not going to be alone.
Every bit of influence I can...

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.849
Mr. Hagen?

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.908
Mr. Hagen!

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:15.915
Mr. Hagen?

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.756
Steve, your office
and Mr. Janoth's are the
only ones we haven't...

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.762
The search is off.
Send everybody home.

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.355
"Off"? What about
Jefferson Randolph?
Who is he?

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.367
Not interested.

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:31.296
You insufferable egomaniac!

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:34.307
You thought you inspired
such adulation that I'd
do anything for you.

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:38.110
George,
Janoth killed Pauline.

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:40.113
You'll say that
in court?
I will.

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.416
No!

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:18.551
George, are you
all right?
Sure.

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:21.918
I've been so worried.
Did he get away?
Yeah, he got away.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:25.481
Get me
the police department.

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:27.584
Where is he?
Elevator shaft.

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:33.564
Aah! It's him!

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:36.330
Who?
Jefferson Randolph?

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:39.498
