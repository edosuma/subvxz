00:00.039 --> 00:01.789
<i>Previously, on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.819 --> 00:03.757
Quentin...

00:03.835 --> 00:05.537
<i>I killed a god.</i>

00:05.586 --> 00:08.148
Gods like Ember have parents, you idiot.

00:08.203 --> 00:09.820
<i>When we're harmless, they ignore us.</i>

00:09.845 --> 00:12.233
<i>But when we become malignant,
they amputate.</i>

00:13.608 --> 00:15.344
Magic is gone.

00:15.376 --> 00:18.241
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

00:18.296 --> 00:20.766
<i>The woman and child you stole.</i>

00:20.799 --> 00:22.991
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

00:23.015 --> 00:25.151
I had to warn you. They're coming.

00:27.452 --> 00:30.588
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

00:30.622 --> 00:32.658
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

00:32.683 --> 00:35.560
- You signed that insane contract?
- Yeah, it's okay.

00:35.592 --> 00:37.664
- Did you do this for me?
- Just say it.

00:37.689 --> 00:38.740
Cancer.

00:38.765 --> 00:41.066
- Call it Cancer plus.
- How long till I die?

00:41.098 --> 00:42.133
Two or three weeks.

00:42.159 --> 00:43.322
I need your help.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.392
<i>If Penny's in the library,
he can be your mole.</i>

00:45.417 --> 00:46.915
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.

00:46.939 --> 00:48.908
Deal.

00:48.941 --> 00:51.210
<i>As a niffin, you made enemies.</i>

00:51.243 --> 00:54.180
<i>I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.</i>

00:54.213 --> 00:56.549
The Lambre. It knows you're weak.

00:56.582 --> 00:58.082
<i>It knows you're here.</i>

00:59.117 --> 01:01.219
<i>He raped me.</i>

01:01.253 --> 01:02.416
Your son.

01:02.441 --> 01:04.777
He turned me into a monster.

01:04.854 --> 01:07.457
You're a survivor.

01:07.593 --> 01:08.960
<i>Why did you bring me back?</i>

01:08.994 --> 01:10.962
<i>I know what you're trying to do.</i>

01:12.664 --> 01:15.835
There is no actual evidence
of magical surge.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.665
The best we can do is accept that

01:17.735 --> 01:20.670
and continue our theoretical studies.

01:20.703 --> 01:22.072
We all get flashes,

01:22.106 --> 01:23.340
and we can do it again.

01:25.776 --> 01:27.411
How?

01:27.908 --> 01:30.476
I have no idea.

01:38.922 --> 01:40.590
Nope. Nothing.

01:40.624 --> 01:42.726
No freeze, no boil.

01:42.759 --> 01:43.761
Shit.

01:43.794 --> 01:44.929
It's okay.

01:44.961 --> 01:46.597
You can still do other stuff.

01:46.637 --> 01:48.573
Q, I can't do anything real.

01:48.598 --> 01:50.600
It's like there's no pattern to this,

01:50.634 --> 01:54.233
nothing that we do can
make it stronger or better.

01:54.258 --> 01:57.108
I'm starting to feel like
it's all random, you know?

01:57.140 --> 01:58.675
Maybe it was a mistake.

01:58.708 --> 02:00.978
Come on, you don't mean that.

02:01.011 --> 02:03.614
What if this is, like, a smudge?

02:03.639 --> 02:06.376
A fingerprint left by OLU when
she gave me back my Shade,

02:06.417 --> 02:07.785
and she didn't even realize?

02:07.817 --> 02:09.953
You know, it's like,
whoops, speck of magic.

02:09.987 --> 02:11.388
She's a goddess.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.023
Does she seem like the accident type?

02:13.055 --> 02:14.858
Have you met her son?

02:14.892 --> 02:18.339
Look, I don't wanna be insensitive...

02:18.364 --> 02:21.868
But you still think I somehow
have this because of Reynard.

02:21.902 --> 02:24.071
I don't know why you have it.

02:24.104 --> 02:25.672
I just... I-I don't think

02:25.706 --> 02:28.809
that we should discount the possibility.

02:28.842 --> 02:30.945
I mean, you've had...

02:30.977 --> 02:34.881
More contact with gods than most.

02:34.915 --> 02:36.350
That's a nicer way of putting it.

02:37.688 --> 02:39.787
For the record, I'm still
leaning towards fluke.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.690
So it's a fluke. There's still something

02:42.723 --> 02:44.658
that could lead us to something.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.795
We have got to keep
chipping away at it, Jules.

02:47.827 --> 02:50.331
Big words coming from a guy who's mostly

02:50.363 --> 02:51.831
chain-smoking and binge-watching

02:51.864 --> 02:53.365
"Six Feet Under" when I got here.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.725
You fired me up.

02:55.001 --> 02:57.637
You showed me that
there's a fight to fight.

02:57.671 --> 03:00.774
Now I am the official sidekick

03:00.807 --> 03:03.143
to whatever it turns out you are, okay?

03:03.176 --> 03:06.245
So, get used to it.

03:06.766 --> 03:09.336
Wake up, asshole.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.028 --> 03:23.831
What, were you a boy scout?
These are great.

03:24.031 --> 03:26.333
Not a good time to go with smart-ass.

03:26.358 --> 03:28.802
I'm not a killer, but times are strange

03:28.834 --> 03:30.671
and you're the one
who broke into my home.

03:30.703 --> 03:31.838
Yeah, well, I'm a librarian.

03:31.872 --> 03:33.207
You're ignoring our requests.

03:33.239 --> 03:34.742
That book was overdue.

03:34.774 --> 03:37.176
Overdue book? Come on.

03:37.344 --> 03:39.364
It's my job.

03:39.713 --> 03:42.059
What's the Library's real game?

03:42.381 --> 03:43.850
Books?

03:43.884 --> 03:45.351
Why do you care anymore?

03:45.385 --> 03:49.189
'Cause what the hell else
is there to do anymore?

03:50.690 --> 03:51.925
Man, hey, that thing...

03:51.957 --> 03:54.895
- Is not your business.
- It's Mayakovsky's spell, right?

03:54.927 --> 03:56.304
Little something the brew up current?

03:56.328 --> 03:57.397
It's fake.

03:57.431 --> 03:59.065
It does not make magic.

03:59.099 --> 04:01.935
It does blow up like a meth lab.

04:01.968 --> 04:04.405
You met Mayakovsky?

04:04.438 --> 04:06.707
I'd know his spellwork anywhere.

04:06.739 --> 04:07.916
Yeah, me too, and I'm telling you...

04:07.940 --> 04:09.842
All of this is his fault.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.112
It... by his, you mean...

04:12.144 --> 04:15.014
Made a bunch
of apocalypse-proof batteries,

04:15.047 --> 04:18.184
then did something to turn
it all off all over the world.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.187
Breaks his Incorporate Bond,

04:20.220 --> 04:24.158
screws us, he's got magic, he's free.

04:24.191 --> 04:27.178
Tell you what Mayakovsky
didn't think about...

04:27.360 --> 04:30.225
Creatures. They're fine.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.466
Whatever they are, it's DNA.

04:33.499 --> 04:35.935
So I hear.

04:38.405 --> 04:39.807
We're fish bait now.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.775
Thank God I got this place,

04:41.807 --> 04:43.177
'cause they're coming.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.344
I promise you.

04:51.283 --> 04:54.053
Well, karma is a righteous bitch.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.254
Karma's gonna be...

04:55.288 --> 04:57.018
we kill them all, son.

04:57.043 --> 04:58.399
If you can.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.558
I mean, some of them look just like us.

05:00.825 --> 05:04.274
You'd never know
they're not quite human.

05:20.606 --> 05:24.120

05:34.461 --> 05:36.396
I like the little apron.

05:36.429 --> 05:38.131
Penny.

05:38.165 --> 05:40.033
Penny.

05:40.066 --> 05:41.969
You shouldn't be here.

05:42.001 --> 05:43.545
You don't have that kind
of time to waste.

05:43.569 --> 05:44.971
It's not wasted.

05:45.004 --> 05:46.172
They treating you okay?

05:46.206 --> 05:49.009
Everything's fine. It's all fine.

05:49.042 --> 05:51.111
Nothing is fine.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.480
I'm looking at you. There's that.

05:53.513 --> 05:54.982
You look good.

05:55.014 --> 05:56.149
White-knuckle sobriety

05:56.182 --> 05:58.184
and forced celibacy's my look.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.954
You need to go back.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.165
I-I was kinda thinking we were

06:03.189 --> 06:05.958
gonna grab a quickie in the car.

06:05.992 --> 06:07.561
Yeah, that sounds great,

06:07.593 --> 06:10.163
except I don't have a car, and...

06:10.187 --> 06:13.559
and you're fucking dying.

06:13.930 --> 06:15.632
Worth it.

06:19.605 --> 06:20.975
Go.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.943
I love you.

06:25.244 --> 06:26.280
Go.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.057
We don't have the funds to...

06:37.090 --> 06:38.926
We're just going to have to borrow.

06:38.958 --> 06:41.227
Begging Pardon, but Tick is right.

06:52.004 --> 06:53.606
Excuse me, Sire.

06:56.294 --> 06:57.543
Your Majesty?

07:06.586 --> 07:08.388
Look,

07:08.420 --> 07:11.624
there is no unshitty answer
to any of this, people,

07:11.650 --> 07:13.219
so suck it up.

07:24.898 --> 07:26.405
Mmm.

07:26.439 --> 07:27.439
Yeah.

07:28.641 --> 07:30.243
We need to discuss the borders.

07:30.276 --> 07:32.211
Great.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.379
After lunch.

07:33.413 --> 07:35.415
Thank you. Dismissed.

07:38.251 --> 07:40.587
We have things to discuss, dear.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.288
- Fabulous.
- Not you.

07:42.321 --> 07:44.891
Your long-suffering high queen.

07:44.925 --> 07:46.393
You may go.

07:46.425 --> 07:50.296
Margo, stay.

07:52.432 --> 07:55.577
Lumbricus Campestris.

07:55.602 --> 07:56.670
Don't tell me.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
Feather of a left-handed crow?

07:58.704 --> 08:01.474
Butterfly with PMS this time?

08:01.508 --> 08:05.394
Turtle semen with a rosemary garnish?

08:05.419 --> 08:07.280
It's a type of earthworm.

08:07.314 --> 08:11.451
It lives abundantly in the
grounds around the castle.

08:11.484 --> 08:13.120
Collect them all.

08:15.187 --> 08:17.356
Okay.

08:17.561 --> 08:22.194
Really enjoying our ongoing whimsy-fest,

08:22.227 --> 08:27.033
but I am a tad busy trying to
keep the country from starving,

08:27.196 --> 08:29.391
- so...
- Better hurry, then.

08:45.451 --> 08:48.116
You were gone too long.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.796
Was I?

08:51.057 --> 08:53.427
Thought I was...

08:54.403 --> 08:56.228
You have to move quickly out there.

08:56.254 --> 08:58.007
Every time you leave this
branch, you go where

08:58.031 --> 09:00.033
time moves normally
and where time progresses...

09:00.066 --> 09:02.336
So does my super cancer, I know.

09:02.369 --> 09:04.379
It's a pity the best y'all
could do was a place where

09:04.403 --> 09:06.273
time stopped.

09:06.306 --> 09:08.075
You know, time going backward?

09:08.108 --> 09:09.276
That'd be better.

09:09.308 --> 09:10.582
I've been giving you assignments

09:10.606 --> 09:12.041
that shouldn't take more than an hour.

09:12.065 --> 09:13.868
- I don't want you...
- Me to die?

09:14.884 --> 09:16.516
How sweet of you,

09:16.548 --> 09:19.552
considering you poisoned me.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.555
You know that wasn't me.

09:21.587 --> 09:23.622
No one wants you to die.

09:23.656 --> 09:25.325
I know.

09:25.358 --> 09:27.461
You know, travelers? Hard to come by.

09:27.494 --> 09:29.595
I wish you wouldn't be so cynical.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.000
Thank you. You need to rest.

09:36.399 --> 09:38.135
How is it?

09:38.294 --> 09:39.896
Out there?

09:41.140 --> 09:43.343
Depressing.

09:55.788 --> 09:56.788
- Henry.
- Ah.

09:58.258 --> 10:01.194
Is that... is that Irene McAllistair?

10:01.226 --> 10:04.130
Well, it is good to see you.

10:06.698 --> 10:08.200
And how is the...

10:08.234 --> 10:09.536
The board of trustees?

10:09.568 --> 10:12.405
Oh, well, out of their minds.

10:12.438 --> 10:14.740
Well, I don't need to tell you
how many of their companies

10:14.773 --> 10:16.275
went belly up when magic died.

10:16.308 --> 10:18.906
You do not. I have stock in several.

10:18.931 --> 10:20.646
- Join the club.
- Yeah.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.152
And your family?

10:25.185 --> 10:26.420
Well, you know them.

10:26.452 --> 10:30.256
Stuffy, cautious... survive anything.

10:30.289 --> 10:33.292
But the rest of the board...

10:33.326 --> 10:37.696
Look, Henry, I came here
alone because I respect you.

10:37.730 --> 10:40.100
Well, you taught me
everything that I know.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.436
- No need to exaggerate.
- I'm not.

10:42.469 --> 10:45.504
And no one needs to convince me
that this school is important.

10:45.538 --> 10:48.174
I gather that's not the case
for everyone.

10:48.207 --> 10:50.209
They're panicked.

10:50.243 --> 10:51.578
They want magic.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.513
So too do we all.

10:53.546 --> 10:55.749
They believe that there's gotta be

10:55.782 --> 10:57.783
something out there somewhere.

10:57.816 --> 10:59.219
Mayakovsky.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.288
He was working on a-a battery.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.355
We searched Brakebills South...

11:03.389 --> 11:08.294
Still, they feel that, uh,
the resources of this school

11:08.327 --> 11:11.331
would be best spent
continuing to search for...

11:11.364 --> 11:14.167
I cannot stop my students
from searching.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.235
But we are a school.

11:16.268 --> 11:17.637
We still teach here.

11:17.669 --> 11:19.738
It is perhaps more important than ever.

11:19.772 --> 11:21.408
If they don't learn it,

11:21.441 --> 11:23.810
I fear no one will ever again,
you understand?

11:23.842 --> 11:25.277
I fear that too.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.480
But if you don't find them something...

11:29.182 --> 11:32.252
The board is gonna
close down Brakebills.

11:32.284 --> 11:35.355
You have to give them something, Henry.

11:35.388 --> 11:36.723
Quickly.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.319
So, what do you think?

11:46.987 --> 11:49.389
Okay, say you were to do it.

11:49.452 --> 11:51.588
Work your way through some
piddly little Earth gods,

11:51.630 --> 11:53.799
find a way to talk to an actual Old God,

11:53.832 --> 11:55.434
and you say what?

11:55.468 --> 11:57.170
Hi, please reconsider,
even though you are

11:57.202 --> 12:00.639
a billion times smarter than I,
and... and... more powerful,

12:00.672 --> 12:02.884
if you could please bring back
magic, that would be great.

12:02.908 --> 12:04.619
I don't know, I just...
I figured it couldn't hurt

12:04.643 --> 12:07.647
to get a little closer
and maybe meet someone

12:07.680 --> 12:09.616
who knew more than we do.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.484
- I hear you, Q, I do. I just...
- What?

12:12.518 --> 12:14.487
I wouldn't want what happened to me

12:14.519 --> 12:15.922
to happen to anyone else.

12:17.856 --> 12:20.426
Look, you don't have to come.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.204
I just... I just wanted you to know.

12:22.229 --> 12:25.245
Okay, you're gonna do a summoning alone?

12:27.733 --> 12:29.102
Yeah.

12:29.134 --> 12:31.138
I don't... I don't know.

12:33.505 --> 12:35.040
Okay, say I was willing to risk it.

12:35.074 --> 12:38.077
I mean, it requires serious, big magic.

12:38.109 --> 12:39.880
Okay, well, cultures all over the world

12:39.905 --> 12:42.482
have believed in these gods.
How did they call them?

12:42.507 --> 12:44.217
Suffice to say, not quite the party

12:44.249 --> 12:47.537
I was expecting when
I came down here, but...

12:47.978 --> 12:49.547
I think I could help you.

12:50.956 --> 12:52.426
<i>How can I help you?</i>

12:55.827 --> 12:57.129
Yeah.

12:57.162 --> 12:58.802
I was gonna respond,
and then I remembered

12:58.830 --> 12:59.965
there's no point.

12:59.998 --> 13:01.868
You can't help Penny anymore.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.429
Says who?

13:06.690 --> 13:08.292
What is that?

Get anyone not actively...

13:58.858 --> 14:00.859
Our full team is required
to keep the castle safe.

14:00.893 --> 14:02.638
Okay, okay, so get like five
or six and do this for me.

14:02.662 --> 14:03.830
Quick and dirty.

14:09.869 --> 14:11.671
Ah, there you are.

14:11.704 --> 14:12.972
Come join.

14:13.004 --> 14:14.306
The southern province is

14:14.340 --> 14:16.599
whatever the Fillorian word
for bankrupt is.

14:16.624 --> 14:17.825
I need a drink.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.452
So quick, little queen.

14:19.477 --> 14:20.947
Where are the worms?

14:20.972 --> 14:23.808
Don't tell me you sent
someone out to do your work.

14:25.317 --> 14:27.085
I'm a delegator.

14:27.119 --> 14:30.623
It's a leadership quality.

14:30.656 --> 14:32.792
You've clearly mastered it.

14:32.825 --> 14:34.860
I thought I was clear.

14:34.893 --> 14:38.163
They are to be plucked by female hands.

14:38.196 --> 14:41.900
And I desire those hands to be yours.

14:41.933 --> 14:44.203
But only if you wish to keep them.

14:53.650 --> 14:56.585
Shit!

14:56.681 --> 14:58.216
Now this is bad.

14:58.249 --> 15:00.787
I waited till I was sure none of those

15:00.820 --> 15:03.189
creepy little no-eyebrow
fuckers were around

15:03.221 --> 15:05.123
before I delegated.

15:05.157 --> 15:07.026
So, how'd she know?

15:07.058 --> 15:09.728
And so fast?

15:11.263 --> 15:12.798
All right, so how do you know

15:12.831 --> 15:13.998
that he'll even be here tonight?

15:14.022 --> 15:16.269
I mean, there's a million
parties happening all over.

15:16.301 --> 15:17.202
Easy.

15:17.235 --> 15:18.630
He's on social media?

15:18.655 --> 15:20.381
How else are followers
supposed to find him?

15:20.406 --> 15:23.209
Met him by total accident at Art Basel.

15:23.242 --> 15:25.945
He kept that party going
eight full days.

15:27.079 --> 15:29.681
Best eight days of my life.

15:29.715 --> 15:31.618
Anyway, that's his thing.

15:31.651 --> 15:35.121
Swing in, stoke the party,
soak in the worship, move on.

15:35.153 --> 15:37.023
Inspiring, right?

15:37.056 --> 15:38.758

16:30.577 --> 16:31.812
Mm.

16:32.946 --> 16:37.017
Abigail mentioned you have
many fairy guests these days.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.623
Guests,

16:38.648 --> 16:40.484
hostile occupying force,

16:40.539 --> 16:41.781
tomato, tomahto.

16:41.806 --> 16:44.331
I presume you wish to extend the most

16:44.363 --> 16:47.499
elegant level of hospitality.

16:47.525 --> 16:48.643
Do I?

16:48.721 --> 16:50.829
For this reason, I make you aware of the

16:50.862 --> 16:53.933
corridor built by
High Queen ChenLi the Bookish,

16:53.966 --> 16:56.369
of rare stone from the Shivering Sea.

16:56.401 --> 16:57.937
Okay.

16:57.969 --> 16:59.071
Why?

16:59.103 --> 17:02.007
Unfortunately, certain species

17:02.041 --> 17:04.994
are allergic to the substance.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.545
How allergic?

17:06.602 --> 17:10.151
- Violently, your majesty.
- Good to know.

17:10.190 --> 17:12.825
We advise that your guests
cannot tolerate that area

17:12.852 --> 17:15.320
so if you are looking for them,

17:15.346 --> 17:18.743
they will undoubtedly be

17:19.157 --> 17:21.394
somewhere else.

17:21.426 --> 17:23.829
A-plus, Rafe.

17:25.452 --> 17:27.221
Huh.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.035
If Rafe says so, guess maybe
we're not the first royals

17:30.068 --> 17:32.571
living a 24/7 fairy reach-around.

17:35.149 --> 17:36.848
So what the hell are we gonna do?

17:36.873 --> 17:38.619
About Queen Bitch and all
her spooky little bitches?

17:38.643 --> 17:40.179
Poison sounds nice.

17:40.211 --> 17:43.015
Shockingly,
all books on poison disappeared

17:43.047 --> 17:45.603
from the royal library right
around the time they arrived.

17:45.628 --> 17:47.452
They're armed, they're smart,

17:47.486 --> 17:48.854
they're multitudinous,

17:48.888 --> 17:49.998
they are invisible to the guard...

17:50.022 --> 17:51.457
When you put it that way.

17:51.489 --> 17:53.558
What if they know about this in Loria?

17:53.592 --> 17:55.561
If I send Idri a message...

17:55.593 --> 17:57.041
Worst case he comes here,

17:57.066 --> 17:58.965
you look at him naked
and cheer up a little.

17:58.997 --> 18:01.266
How dare you make me sound that shallow,

18:01.300 --> 18:02.569
but yes.

18:06.861 --> 18:07.974
Hi.

18:08.006 --> 18:09.542
Great to see you, as always.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.244
I'll go write that letter.

18:11.276 --> 18:12.444
To who?

18:12.477 --> 18:14.546
Not Idri of Loria?

18:14.580 --> 18:16.082
Actually, yes.

18:16.914 --> 18:19.651
Our crops are dying now that
we can't schedule the rain.

18:19.685 --> 18:21.587
I hope he can help.

18:21.620 --> 18:25.157
His library, like yours,
has of course been purged

18:25.189 --> 18:28.609
of any material
pertaining to our species.

18:28.928 --> 18:32.331
And any Lorian aware
of the existence of fairies

18:32.609 --> 18:35.668
has been instructed
to keep their mouth shut

18:36.000 --> 18:38.336
or lose their tongue.

18:38.478 --> 18:41.986
Please don't underestimate me again.

18:42.641 --> 18:45.017
It hurts my feelings.

18:45.311 --> 18:48.147
We're gonna go take
a walk and have a good think

18:48.283 --> 18:49.973
about our behavior.

18:59.591 --> 19:01.227
Come on, we not fun yet?

19:06.098 --> 19:08.400
Yeah, do we not... do we not amuse!

19:08.432 --> 19:09.702
Do we not amuse?

19:13.272 --> 19:14.761
Hey.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.110

19:18.142 --> 19:19.312
Okay. Oof.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.146
Remember that time, 10th grade, right?

19:21.179 --> 19:23.615
And we made up that dance
and it was terrible.

19:23.649 --> 19:25.051
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.687
So white and bad.

19:27.719 --> 19:29.516
Yeah, that might actually work.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.656
It was very, like,
hip thrusty if I remember.

19:31.689 --> 19:34.032
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

21:53.765 --> 21:57.328
Magic is gone for you little guys?

21:57.602 --> 21:59.270
You don't say.

21:59.304 --> 22:01.107
What is... all over the U.S.?

22:01.140 --> 22:02.708
All over everywhere, we think.

22:02.740 --> 22:04.576
I've been a little

22:04.743 --> 22:07.326
out of touch.

22:07.513 --> 22:09.279
Well, that sucks for you.

22:09.515 --> 22:11.201
Why?

22:11.717 --> 22:13.139
Well...

22:13.377 --> 22:15.142
I, um...

22:15.254 --> 22:16.828
Sort of killed a-a god.

22:16.853 --> 22:18.797
A minor... like, a very, you know...

22:18.822 --> 22:20.326
- We had to.
- A minor god.

22:20.359 --> 22:22.455
Not because we wanted to,
but just because we had to.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.562
- You understand...
- Who?

22:25.264 --> 22:27.699
Who the fuck did you kill?

22:28.873 --> 22:31.135
Um, Ember in...

22:31.503 --> 22:32.505
Fillory?

22:36.842 --> 22:39.837
I don't know that guy.

22:40.710 --> 22:42.513
Deserved it. I...

22:45.643 --> 22:48.108
Tough choices make a man, man.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.857
- Yeah.
- Open your mouth.

22:49.882 --> 22:52.725
- Sorry?
- Like, open your mouth.

22:56.428 --> 22:57.729
Happy birthday.

22:57.763 --> 23:00.533
Okay, so this is gonna be

23:00.565 --> 23:03.201
a little bit more
challenging than we expected.

23:03.235 --> 23:04.803
What did you put in my mouth?

23:27.993 --> 23:29.528
Alice? Where are you going?

23:29.568 --> 23:32.405
I can't do this.
I can't study dead magic.

23:32.430 --> 23:33.970
- I can't...
- Can we just...

23:34.025 --> 23:36.401
go sit down somewhere and talk, please?

23:36.435 --> 23:38.617
Stop. Look, here's the deal.

23:38.642 --> 23:40.345
I thought if we hung out, maybe had sex,

23:40.372 --> 23:42.574
I don't know, went to school,
it would feel like it did.

23:42.608 --> 23:44.710
I thought I could forgive you,
but I can't.

23:44.743 --> 23:46.312
I just...

23:46.344 --> 23:49.095
Say good-bye and let me go.

23:49.848 --> 23:50.916
Good-bye, Alice.

23:52.346 --> 23:53.485
Alice?

23:57.956 --> 23:59.792
Nope.

24:43.409 --> 24:44.769
Very high.

24:44.803 --> 24:46.639
I get it.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.743
Does your high ever turn on you

24:50.775 --> 24:53.344
and you go from happy to

from being sexually assaulted

by a trickster god.

25:07.958 --> 25:09.797
Long story.

25:10.053 --> 25:12.078
I got time.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.732
Let's talk about something else.

25:14.766 --> 25:15.868
Sure.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.023
Sure, whatever you...

25:19.737 --> 25:22.466
Hey, you ever, uh...

25:23.574 --> 25:24.919
I'm sorry.

25:25.110 --> 25:28.372
I just really loved doing magic.

25:28.972 --> 25:30.450
And I was good at it.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.959
You should have tasted my tomatoes.

25:34.986 --> 25:37.553
And just, the air
smelled different, right?

25:37.756 --> 25:39.958
And I could turn into a bird,
or... or... or...

25:39.990 --> 25:42.216
make a rose bloom.

25:42.460 --> 25:45.138
And I saw actual Fillory.

25:45.363 --> 25:47.365
And I banged a werewolf, yes.

25:47.443 --> 25:50.636
That is weird, but also rad,
because who gets to do that?

25:52.403 --> 25:55.628
And I wasn't just some
extremely average nobody.

25:55.873 --> 25:58.284
I was gifted.

25:58.810 --> 26:00.198
I didn't just belong somewhere.

26:00.223 --> 26:03.701
I belonged anywhere
because I was a Magician.

26:08.354 --> 26:09.693
I just...

26:11.357 --> 26:14.093
I don't even know what
anything is even about anymore.

26:19.797 --> 26:22.034
Maybe there's a way to get it back.

26:22.066 --> 26:24.102
Look, no offense,

26:24.126 --> 26:26.212
I've been researching, and...

27:22.684 --> 27:24.388
- You're blasted!
- Yeah, but even I know that

27:24.412 --> 27:26.474
you cannot show people that.

27:26.499 --> 27:27.701
Why not?

27:27.726 --> 27:29.210
Because if the wrong people found out...

27:29.234 --> 27:31.602
He is not the wrong people.

27:31.635 --> 27:33.905
I can't go through the rest of my life

27:33.939 --> 27:35.140
just not trusting anyone.

27:35.165 --> 27:36.667
I feel fucked up enough.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.372
I get that.

27:39.397 --> 27:43.047
Just put yourself in my shoes
just for one second, Q.

27:43.081 --> 27:44.983
I have magic.

27:45.016 --> 27:46.951
And what does it do?

27:46.985 --> 27:48.187
More or less jack shit.

27:48.219 --> 27:50.655
And I see someone whose entire life

27:50.835 --> 27:52.890
would change if he could just see it.

27:53.073 --> 27:55.177
<i>♪ Summer feelings are waiting ♪</i>

27:55.202 --> 27:57.062
I have to be able
to do something with it.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.198
And if that's cheer up Josh Hoberman,

27:59.230 --> 28:00.598
then I'll take it.

28:00.631 --> 28:02.459
Because I can't... you know,

28:02.484 --> 28:05.036
I can't be so precious with
something that is so small.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.201
It's not small, it's the...

28:07.506 --> 28:10.267
it's the biggest magic, Jules.

28:10.609 --> 28:12.493
'Cause as far as we know,

28:12.744 --> 28:16.247
for us little guys,
it's the only magic out there.

28:23.822 --> 28:25.524
Oww! What... oww.

28:25.556 --> 28:27.134
Dude, you're gonna leave
a mark and I don't like that

28:27.158 --> 28:28.727
in a non-sexual context.

28:28.759 --> 28:31.229
Okay, okay, okay, okay, um...

28:32.771 --> 28:35.276
You watched "Battlestar," right?

28:35.323 --> 28:37.134
Yeah, I love when they
do terrorism allegory

28:37.159 --> 28:39.315
- with mostly white people.
- Mm-hmm.

28:39.340 --> 28:40.972
You remember Grace Park in season one?

28:41.006 --> 28:42.140
Of course, best storyline.

28:42.172 --> 28:43.275
- Why?
- Duh...

28:43.307 --> 28:44.542
because she was actually...

28:44.575 --> 28:46.178
You're Grace Park.

28:46.210 --> 28:47.578
Okay?

28:47.612 --> 28:50.516
You're Grace Park, Margo.

28:54.218 --> 28:55.821
I'm Grace Park.

28:55.853 --> 28:57.021
Yeah.

28:57.054 --> 28:58.623
And we have ourselves a bit of a

28:58.657 --> 29:00.058
Gene Hackman in "The Conversation."

29:00.091 --> 29:03.303
- I didn't see that one.
- Yeah, right, um...

29:03.661 --> 29:07.499
Someone is "xoxo,
Gossip Girl"-ing our shit.

29:08.566 --> 29:11.936
Remember James Marsden in X-Men, hm?

29:11.969 --> 29:14.605
Your Marsden is xoxo-ing us

29:14.639 --> 29:16.742
full on that great song by The Police.

29:17.575 --> 29:21.337
That Fairuza Balk in "The Craft."

29:21.746 --> 29:24.698
Yeah, more Cersei Lannister.

29:24.882 --> 29:28.627
Hey, glad I made you read those.

29:29.086 --> 29:30.655
Well, I read the Wiki.

29:30.689 --> 29:32.623
What? Those books are
like a million pages long.

29:32.657 --> 29:33.958
- I have a life.
- Okay.

29:33.991 --> 29:35.192
Anyway,

29:35.226 --> 29:37.295
whatever your Marsden would xoxo,

29:37.329 --> 29:38.664
Cersei xoxo's.

29:38.697 --> 29:40.571
So, we have to keep it very

29:40.596 --> 29:42.524
- best episode of "Buffy."
- Musical?

29:42.549 --> 29:44.175
The other one.

29:44.201 --> 29:45.269
Okay.

29:45.303 --> 29:47.205
How do we Lizzie Borden

29:47.237 --> 29:49.674
the shit out of this thing?

29:49.708 --> 29:54.525
'Cause I am about ready
to go full '07 Britney.

29:54.879 --> 29:58.183
Maybe we could've back when
this place was Pottered up.

29:58.216 --> 29:59.351
Still.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.152
Even without a wand,

30:01.186 --> 30:03.054
Harry would figure some shit out.

30:04.922 --> 30:07.325
Honestly, I didn't quite
finish those books either...

30:07.359 --> 30:09.229
Our Harry, I mean.

30:09.260 --> 30:11.924
Oh! Him.

30:12.330 --> 30:13.365
Well, he'd...

30:15.166 --> 30:16.268
Mm-hmm.

30:16.301 --> 30:18.270
Consult the creepy pedophile.

30:19.863 --> 30:20.898
Mmm.

30:30.697 --> 30:32.399
We're close, I think.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.968
I thought this excursion was
mostly about drinking heavily.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.803
I needed to imply that

30:36.844 --> 30:39.981
so we could get away
without extra eyes on us.

30:41.408 --> 30:43.343
Fairies, Tick.

30:43.377 --> 30:46.413
When magic died, they pounced.

30:46.446 --> 30:47.982
Full occupation.

30:48.014 --> 30:51.289
This explains so much.

30:51.485 --> 30:53.254
What will we do?

31:00.893 --> 31:03.587
The white lady was spotted
somewhere around here.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.963
We're going to shoot her,

31:04.988 --> 31:06.790
and then we're going
to wish those fairies

31:06.815 --> 31:08.518
to the fucking cornfield.

31:08.568 --> 31:10.844
Oh, excellent.

31:11.297 --> 31:13.540
Whatever a cornfield is.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.715
Oh, whoa!

31:23.749 --> 31:25.684
There he is!

31:27.353 --> 31:29.822
Man... or, god, I just...

31:29.855 --> 31:31.964

31:33.759 --> 31:35.323

put in my mouth...

31:35.347 --> 31:37.030
I just... I feel like...

31:37.167 --> 31:39.598

31:39.632 --> 31:40.800
in the good way.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.601
You know? It's like,

31:42.635 --> 31:44.037
- whoa!
- Haha, whoa.

31:44.062 --> 31:45.601
- All right.
- Okay.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.642

I was thinking, while we're here,

32:05.057 --> 32:07.006
maybe I could ask you a few questions.

32:07.139 --> 32:08.227
Dude.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.029
You're a vibe-killer.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.798
- No.
- Yes, you are.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.616
And historically,
I do smite vibe-killers.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.069
No, look, I'm a vibe-supporter.

32:16.094 --> 32:18.905
I just also happen to be
a concerned Magician individual

32:18.937 --> 32:21.239
who would like to get

32:24.644 --> 32:27.501

32:28.213 --> 32:32.784

who I haven't spoken to in a millennia.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.156

Look, I know that this
really wasn't on your radar

32:45.931 --> 32:47.400
until you met us, but we've lost

32:47.433 --> 32:49.631
our most precious resource.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.427
Dude, stop, okay?

32:52.490 --> 32:54.380
If fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

32:54.406 --> 32:56.274
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

32:56.308 --> 32:58.011
that I met back in Athens one time.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.379
Rambo! Rambo!

33:00.413 --> 33:02.415
What was the name of that guy
that I met in Athens,

33:02.447 --> 33:04.349
that up-with-humans guy?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.718
Fit bod.

33:05.758 --> 33:06.826
You mean Prometheus?

33:06.851 --> 33:07.953
Prom...

33:07.986 --> 33:09.721
That guy loved Magicians,

33:09.754 --> 33:11.757
and he would want to help you.

33:11.790 --> 33:12.825
He's dead.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.327
What?

33:14.359 --> 33:18.397
Prometheus died,
like, 1,500 years ago, man.

33:18.438 --> 33:19.706
Sorry.

33:19.732 --> 33:20.933
Damn it.

33:22.122 --> 33:24.904
Well, he lived
a pretty tortured existence,

33:24.929 --> 33:29.000
so, dying was probably a relief for him.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.346
But, still, uh, he would've helped you.

33:33.385 --> 33:35.989
He told me this crazy story one time

33:36.014 --> 33:39.217
about how there's like...

33:39.251 --> 33:43.050
like, a secret back door to magic.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.189
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

33:45.214 --> 33:49.127
I don't remember the deets,
okay, my face was melting off.

33:49.331 --> 33:52.083
Secret back door.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.443
- Just, something...
- Mm-hmm.

33:55.678 --> 33:57.708
Wait!

33:58.169 --> 34:00.755
Might've been a brothel.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.415
Shots.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.949
Tick?

34:13.753 --> 34:15.384
Tick?

34:15.779 --> 34:17.047
Shit.

34:31.774 --> 34:34.010
Not the best idea, Eliot.

34:36.474 --> 34:37.509
Um...

34:39.478 --> 34:41.848
I was looking for the White Lady.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.049
Is this she?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.259
Look, if you don't come out of there,

34:54.293 --> 34:55.795
I'm going to have to shoot you.

34:55.828 --> 34:56.688
Gods!

34:56.713 --> 34:58.463

34:58.496 --> 34:59.765
For example,

34:59.799 --> 35:02.335
my, my, High King Eliot.

35:02.477 --> 35:06.371
Your long legs look
so well in those breeches.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.616
Thank you.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.244
Your turn.

35:13.978 --> 35:16.937
You sound like a...

35:17.868 --> 35:19.363
very attractive Creature.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.552
You think so?

35:20.585 --> 35:22.420
I've met many non-humans,

35:22.454 --> 35:24.123
and your voice is

35:24.243 --> 35:26.142
by far the...

35:26.525 --> 35:27.559
sexiest.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.861
- Really?
- I mean, you sound noble.

35:31.103 --> 35:34.040
- I didn't mean...
- You're wise,

35:34.438 --> 35:36.040
for I am, indeed,

35:36.175 --> 35:38.724
the sexiest in the land.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.138
It is I,

35:40.310 --> 35:43.279
the Great Cock of The Darkling Woods.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.279
The Great...

35:45.445 --> 35:46.615
Cock.

35:46.748 --> 35:48.948
Have you never beheld one,
child of Earth?

35:49.026 --> 35:52.017
No, no. No, I've beheld one or two.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.121
But you are, by far, the most majestic.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.284
I'm diligent about hydration.

35:57.484 --> 36:01.275
All right, petitioner, let's chat.

36:26.634 --> 36:28.202
I like your style.

36:28.248 --> 36:30.618
What is the point of hearing a petition

36:30.778 --> 36:32.579
if the aesthetics are shit?

36:36.269 --> 36:38.227
I need help with a fairy thing.

36:40.238 --> 36:44.376
Tribal matriarchies
are the absolute worse.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.922
So, I was just hoping in

36:48.180 --> 36:51.517
your great, benevolent handsomeness

36:51.542 --> 36:54.621
that you would see fit to grant
me just one little wish.

36:54.653 --> 36:56.121
That's the sort of thing my sister,

36:56.155 --> 36:57.790
The Winter's Doe, specializes in.

36:57.823 --> 37:00.760
Also, when was the last time
a petitioner didn't get

37:00.792 --> 37:04.022
utterly assfucked by a wish-granting?

37:04.183 --> 37:06.119
Yeah.

37:06.222 --> 37:07.524
And yet...

37:07.667 --> 37:09.269
I'll do you better.

37:09.301 --> 37:11.671
There's a problem
far greater than fairies.

37:11.703 --> 37:14.173
Solve it, they're nothing.

37:14.207 --> 37:19.339
I'll send you on an epic quest.

37:19.711 --> 37:21.558
That's...

37:22.067 --> 37:23.102
Ahh.

37:23.245 --> 37:25.614
Wow, that's great. Thank you.

37:25.718 --> 37:28.821
It's just...

37:28.854 --> 37:30.155
My people need help.

37:30.189 --> 37:32.007
- They sure do.
- Today.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.269
The Fairy Queen is sitting
on my throne as we speak.

37:34.334 --> 37:36.268
Do you want your magic back or not?

37:36.294 --> 37:38.130
Will it not solve all your problems?

37:38.164 --> 37:40.155
I mean, yes, but,

37:40.365 --> 37:41.643
it's just...

37:41.901 --> 37:44.120
how long does a quest like this take?

37:44.370 --> 37:46.339
A good season.

37:46.372 --> 37:47.507
Right.

37:47.539 --> 37:49.956
My kingdom is in trouble now.

37:50.575 --> 37:53.329
You are a good king.

37:53.546 --> 37:55.454
But it is time

37:55.747 --> 37:58.251
to become a great one.

37:58.475 --> 38:01.721
In order to do that,
you must travel to a land

38:01.754 --> 38:04.997
where you are no king, no Magician,

38:05.624 --> 38:09.044
just a vulnerable man.

38:09.729 --> 38:11.223
Honestly,

38:11.497 --> 38:13.867
that sounds like something
I might really fuck up.

38:13.976 --> 38:17.250
Yes, or it wouldn't be a quest.

38:18.738 --> 38:20.758
You have friends, don't you?

38:23.709 --> 38:25.032
I used to.

38:25.211 --> 38:27.361
The one-eyed conqueror,

38:27.546 --> 38:30.493
the traveler, the warrior,

38:30.642 --> 38:33.040
the fool, the god-touched,

38:33.193 --> 38:34.494
the lover of tomatoes,

38:34.519 --> 38:36.555
and the torture artist...

38:36.589 --> 38:38.158
Wait, which one is that?

38:38.182 --> 38:39.817
- You lost me there.
- Nevermind.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.928
You have a brother of the heart

38:41.961 --> 38:43.830
with the foppy hair.

38:43.871 --> 38:46.514
- That would be Quentin.
- You're parts of one whole.

38:46.731 --> 38:49.185
No one can do this alone.

38:49.342 --> 38:50.778
Okay.

38:50.882 --> 38:53.851
FYI, I can't contact them
or reach them in any way.

38:54.115 --> 38:57.242
You must find the book with no author.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.657
A tale for children,
but they're hardly that.

38:59.812 --> 39:02.086
There is the key... or, the keys...

39:02.430 --> 39:04.907
in a place called...

39:05.360 --> 39:07.129
Public Library.

39:07.319 --> 39:09.538
In the shire of Chester

39:09.689 --> 39:13.459
in the land of New Jersey.

39:13.492 --> 39:15.260
Again, that sure sounds like Earth.

39:15.294 --> 39:17.797
Eliot, the quest I bestow on you

39:17.830 --> 39:19.866
is the task you were born for.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.434
Claim it.

39:31.644 --> 39:32.745
Abigail,

39:32.778 --> 39:33.812
talking-animal question.

39:33.845 --> 39:36.582
So, bunnies.

39:38.551 --> 39:41.221
Her Sluggishness has noted
that you are aware

39:41.254 --> 39:43.367
of their messenger abilities.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.558
So, that is what the
Fairy Queen uses them for?

39:45.680 --> 39:48.930
Bunnies move easily between worlds.

39:49.405 --> 39:51.541
And do they serve her?

39:51.731 --> 39:53.966
And if so, how loyally?

39:53.999 --> 39:56.435
Every bunny for itself, Majesty.

39:57.998 --> 39:59.234
Thank you.

40:13.296 --> 40:14.564
Need help.

40:14.683 --> 40:16.318
Love, Eliot.

40:33.210 --> 40:34.946
Q.

40:34.971 --> 40:37.335
I think this is it.

40:37.399 --> 40:38.901
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

40:38.954 --> 40:42.124
No author, I mean, I can feel
something coming off of it.

40:48.664 --> 40:50.734
Interesting.

41:07.550 --> 41:09.146
Interesting.

41:09.365 --> 41:13.568
Yeah, if by interesting,
you mean, blank, sure.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.691
Quests never give away the farm.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.160
You've gotta earn everything.

41:19.928 --> 41:21.697
Jules, this is our quest.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.864
And we're already on it.

41:27.482 --> 41:28.699
- Epic Quest.
- We have to.

41:28.738 --> 41:29.715
- Map from the book.
- Work together.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.379
- Also I think...
- Eliot.

41:31.404 --> 41:33.182
- Epic Quest.
- The Great Cock.

41:33.209 --> 41:35.611
- It's called After Island.
- A back door to...

41:35.651 --> 41:36.821
- The Great Cock.
- Epic quest.

41:36.845 --> 41:38.079
- Keys.
- Here's the deal.

41:38.113 --> 41:40.149
- Epic quest.
- All seven keys.

41:40.203 --> 41:43.151
- Here's the deal.
- Epic quest.

41:43.222 --> 41:46.126
Just shush for one second, please.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.090
Oh.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.975
Uh, that one.

41:53.128 --> 41:54.530
Put him first.

41:56.231 --> 41:59.534
Your father and I are so proud of you.

42:02.111 --> 42:05.022
Okay...

42:06.941 --> 42:09.678
We are go for epic quest.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.717
You are indeed a brave king.

42:11.881 --> 42:14.584
I am indeed a guy with not much choice,

42:14.617 --> 42:17.225
but thanks for rounding up.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.187
We're looking for keys.

42:19.459 --> 42:22.824
Q and Julia believe
whatever the keys unlock,

42:23.003 --> 42:24.707
will help restore magic.

42:24.927 --> 42:28.371
And they think the first key
is here in Fillory.

42:28.597 --> 42:29.865
Excellent.

42:29.898 --> 42:32.152
Some place called After Island?

42:32.276 --> 42:33.711
Oh.

42:33.941 --> 42:38.040
It lies beyond our border, Majesty.

42:38.301 --> 42:41.952
You would be venturing
to strange lands not your own.

42:42.167 --> 42:44.071
So, not the friendliest?

42:44.113 --> 42:46.682
It is said that even
the Outer Sea itself

42:46.715 --> 42:49.117
wishes ill upon our king.

42:49.158 --> 42:50.827
Some have sailed before you...

42:50.852 --> 42:52.255
Oh, and how'd that go?

42:52.287 --> 42:53.655
They drowned.

42:53.689 --> 42:55.331
Oh.

42:55.745 --> 42:58.994
Well, how do we prevent that?

42:59.143 --> 43:00.663
I wish I knew, I only...

43:00.695 --> 43:02.612
I know.

43:02.987 --> 43:06.068
I know exactly the boat you need.

43:20.631 --> 43:22.951
Ugh, okay! That's enough.

43:22.985 --> 43:25.568
Let's talk.

43:26.220 --> 43:29.040
So transactional.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.927
What do you want with a Lamprey anyway?

43:32.064 --> 43:34.130
It's more what
the Lamprey wants with me.

43:34.162 --> 43:35.764
Oh, shit.

43:35.798 --> 43:37.667
You poked the wrong bear, sweetness.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.656
Just tell me what you know.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.452
Please?

43:41.477 --> 43:42.647
Well, if you could do magic...

43:42.671 --> 43:44.547
Yeah, well, I can't.

43:45.173 --> 43:46.500
So...

43:46.909 --> 43:49.927
So, you're down
to an early warning device.

43:49.952 --> 43:51.314
An alarm, if you will.

43:51.444 --> 43:53.428
So, just maybe,

43:53.916 --> 43:56.217
you still got time to run.

43:56.285 --> 43:58.288
Okay, fine, I'll take it.

44:04.660 --> 44:06.536
What, is that a joke?

44:06.695 --> 44:08.349
I gave up jokes 80 years ago.

44:08.396 --> 44:11.218
Tired of being misunderstood.

44:11.473 --> 44:12.975
So get one,

44:13.235 --> 44:16.218
and keep it on your person at all times.

44:16.838 --> 44:18.974
Buena suerte.

44:40.749 --> 44:43.342
Just a side of bacon, please.
