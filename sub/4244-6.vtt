About the surgeon?

03:55.697 --> 03:58.781

I've got something that may
require logistical support.

05:51.012 --> 05:52.512
I'll need a small team--

05:52.564 --> 05:54.430
three or four people,
absolutely discreet.

05:54.482 --> 05:55.515
For what?

05:55.567 --> 05:56.649
It involves Haqqani's nephew.

05:56.685 --> 05:58.401
So, I'm guessing
clothing is optional.

What is your fucking problem?

06:00.689 --> 06:01.988
My problem?

06:02.023 --> 06:04.073
My problem is that
a surveillance operation

06:04.109 --> 06:06.743
crashed and burned because
you were nowhere to be found.

06:06.778 --> 06:09.662
Really? I seem to recall
you showing up on my doorstep.

06:09.698 --> 06:11.831

06:11.866 --> 06:12.915

06:12.951 --> 06:14.033

06:14.085 --> 06:15.702

06:15.754 --> 06:17.203

somebody actually willing

06:17.205 --> 06:19.205
to do their job.

07:29.277 --> 07:30.777

London.

07:33.331 --> 07:35.281

07:35.333 --> 07:37.333

07:37.368 --> 07:39.368

07:42.540 --> 07:43.956
How-how will you
move to London?

07:43.958 --> 07:44.957
Where will you stay?

07:44.959 --> 07:46.592
With a friend.

07:46.628 --> 07:47.960
A friend.

07:48.012 --> 07:49.846
A journalist is helping me.

07:49.881 --> 07:52.098
I thought it was a journalist
making your life difficult.

07:52.133 --> 07:54.217
Not this one.

07:56.221 --> 07:57.553
You can't tell anyone.

07:57.605 --> 07:59.439
Really, if anyone finds out...

07:59.474 --> 08:00.857
So, you were just
going to leave

08:00.892 --> 08:03.559
without even
saying good-bye?

08:03.611 --> 08:05.228
That's not fair.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.613
How is it not fair?

08:07.649 --> 08:09.115
Were you?

08:09.150 --> 08:10.783
So, what am I supposed to do,

08:10.819 --> 08:12.785
go to your house,
knock on your door?

08:12.821 --> 08:15.121
The whole reason I'm
in this situation is

08:15.156 --> 08:16.122
because of your father.

08:16.157 --> 08:17.323
He made life impossible here.

08:17.375 --> 08:18.541
He got me kicked out.

08:18.576 --> 08:21.327
At least in London,
I can still be a doctor.

08:21.329 --> 08:23.546
I just, I have to go.

08:23.581 --> 08:26.249

08:31.723 --> 08:32.672

I just did.

08:56.865 --> 08:58.197
Do you love her?

09:00.869 --> 09:03.369
She arranged for me
to go to college in London.

09:05.373 --> 09:07.123
Do you?

09:11.012 --> 09:13.546

a short while.

Kiran showed up.

14:04.755 --> 14:06.172
What, your friend from school?

14:06.174 --> 14:08.841
More than friend. She was.

14:08.843 --> 14:11.010
Did you tell her
that you're leaving?

14:11.012 --> 14:12.845
I didn't have to.
She could just...

14:34.869 --> 14:36.836

My uncle.

To the infidels.
(scoffs)
