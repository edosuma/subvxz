00:09.426 --> 00:11.594
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:11.678 --> 00:15.598
WALRUS OOSIKS TOOK THE ARTISTS
WAY OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONES.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.852
- YOU MUST SCRIMSHAW
A WALRUS PENILE BONE.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.812
- A WALRUS WIENER?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.981
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.275
JULIA CRACKED
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.943
- GIVE ME SOME DIRECTION OR GO.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.903
MY CANVAS IS
A STRAIGHT UP ASS[bleep].

00:28.987 --> 00:29.946
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I GOT IT.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.948
I'M TATTOOING MYSELF.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.450
- ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.285
- BYE. HAVE A NICE LIFE.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.579
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.706
- I WOULD'VE DRAWN
EXACTLY WHAT THE GUY WANTED.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.583
- I WAS TRYING TO COMPROMISE
WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME,

00:41.666 --> 00:43.710
AND HE'S A DISRESPECTFUL DICK.

00:43.793 --> 00:48.715
- THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY HERE.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.676
- SHOULD I GO EFF OFF NOW?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.887
SHE JUST SAID
I HAVE TO DO HER TATTOO

00:54.179 --> 00:56.890
OR I WASN'T GETTING A TATTOO.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.641
- QUIT SHAKING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.894
YOU TOLD HIM TO GO
[bleep] HIMSELF.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.230
UNPROVOKEDLY TOLD HIM
TO GO [bleep] HIMSELF.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.191
- EVERYONE THAT KNOWS ME--
- AT THIS POINT, JUST STOP.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.358
DON'T DIG IT DEEPER.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.110
- I HAD A LAPSE.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.445
- YOU CAN'T LOSE CONTROL
LIKE THAT.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.238
- IT'S DISGUSTING TO ME.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.115
- BE A [bleep] HUMAN.
- [bleep] THIS.

AND ERIK WERE IN THE BOTTOM.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.956
- ERIK.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.708
- WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE
WITH THE CANVAS JURY.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.335
YOU ARE NOT AT A RISK
OF GOING HOME.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.170
- DON.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.088
ATTRACTIVE TATTOO.
- ANGEL.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.423
- I THINK THAT YOU WERE LOST
IN THE DETAILS.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.425

01:32.509 --> 01:34.844
I'M AN ARTIST, AND THIS IS
WHAT THE [bleep] I DO.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.971
- JULIA.
- THIS IS NOT THE WORST TATTOO

01:37.055 --> 01:38.389
OF THE DAY.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.311

BIT MORE HUMBLE.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.767

03:50.063 --> 03:50.229
[bleep] YOU.

04:07.246 --> 04:11.250
{\an7}HEIGHTS DEFINITELY GIVE ME A LOT
OF PANIC AND A LOT OF ANXIETY.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.877
I CAN'T BREATHE.
I CAN'T THINK.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.004
I AM FREAKING THE [bleep] OUT.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.422
I DO NOT WANT
TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.134

04:37.276 --> 04:39.070
{\an8}- AS A TATTOO ARTIST,
ANYTHING CAN COME AT YOU,

04:39.320 --> 04:41.489
{\an8}AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO JUST ADAPT TO THE SITUATION

04:41.572 --> 04:43.574
{\an8}AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.869

JUST BY HAVING THE GUTS

04:53.668 --> 04:56.879
YOU ARE ALL EXAMPLES
OF THE LIVE <i> MAS</i> MENTALITY.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.923
LIKE YOU, YOUR CANVASES TODAY

04:59.007 --> 05:01.092

THEY'RE HERE TO KNOCK SOMETHING
ELSE OFF THEIR MUST-DO LIST.

THEY ALL WANT TO GET
THEIR VERY FIRST TATTOO.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.226
- WHAT?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.478
{\an8}- I HATE TATTOOING FIRST TIMERS
BECAUSE THEY'RE USUALLY

05:12.562 --> 05:14.939
{\an8}THE PICKIEST SONS
OF BITCHES EVER.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.066
- YOU MUST BE ADAPTABLE
TO WORK WITH THEIR IDEAS

05:17.316 --> 05:20.695
AND MAKE THEIR FIRST TATTOO
A MEMORABLE LIFE EXPERIENCE.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.447
{\an8}- USUALLY PEOPLE'S FIRST TATTOO

05:22.530 --> 05:24.198
{\an8}IS SOMETHING THAT'S
EXTREMELY MEANINGFUL FOR THEM

05:24.282 --> 05:26.117
{\an8}TO TAKE THAT LEAP
INTO THE TATTOO WORLD.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.244

CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

05:30.872 --> 05:34.250
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.211
YOU'VE EACH BEEN RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED A HUMAN CANVAS

05:37.295 --> 05:39.797
THAT'S WAITING FOR YOU BACK
AT THE SHOP.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.092
YOU WILL HAVE THREE HOURS
TO TATTOO.

05:43.176 --> 05:43.885
GOOD LUCK.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.682
- WHAT'S UP, BROTHER?
- HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.768
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
- HOW'S IT GOING?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.936
- YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
TO HELP YOUR CANVAS LIVE LIFE

05:54.020 --> 05:58.149
TO THE FULLEST BY GIVING THEM
THEIR VERY FIRST TATTOO,

05:58.232 --> 06:01.194
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.279
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.156
- LIVE <i> MAS.</i>

06:05.239 --> 06:07.075
- THIS IS YOUR FIRST TATTOO,
RIGHT?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.160
- YES, MM-HMM.
- ARE YOU NERVOUS OR EXCITED?

06:09.243 --> 06:11.162
- EXTREMELY.
[laughs]

06:11.412 --> 06:14.123
- IT'S OKAY.
I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
{\an8}- ADAPTABILITY'S IMPORTANT
IN TATTOOING FOR THE SIMPLE FACT

06:16.793 --> 06:18.586
{\an8}THAT THE ONLY WAY
THAT TATTOOERS MAKE MONEY

06:18.669 --> 06:20.171
{\an8}IS ADAPTING TO THEIR CLIENTS.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.048
- I WANT TO DO A POCKET WATCH.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.258
IT HAS TO SAY THE TIME 9:02.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.135
THAT'S, LIKE, THE ONLY PART
THAT I'M REALLY ADAMANT ABOUT.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.178
- NO, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.721
WHAT REASON ARE YOU GETTING--

06:28.805 --> 06:30.431
- MY DAD WAS A WATCHMAKER,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.558
AND MY SON'S BIRTH TIME
WAS 9:02.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.560
AND THAT'S, LIKE, WHEN TIME
REALLY BECAME IMPORTANT.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.312
- I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
DO JUSTICE TO IT FOR YOU.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.231
{\an8}- TODAY, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THESE ARTISTS

06:38.314 --> 06:40.650
{\an8}TO TAKE THE CANVASES' IDEAS,
SKETCH THEM DOWN JUST LIKE THEY

06:40.733 --> 06:42.318
{\an8}WOULD IN A REGULAR
TATTOO SHOP SETTING,

06:42.401 --> 06:43.486
AND MAKE THEM HAPPY.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.321
- FIRST TIME TATTOO.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.572
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.866
- MY COUSIN PASSED AWAY.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.576
RIGHT BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY,
SHE GOT A SUGAR SKULL TATTOO.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.161
- WHERE'S ALL THIS GOING?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.247
- ON MY RIBS.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.290
- I'M JUST CONCERNED
WITH IT BEING YOUR FIRST TATTOO.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.083
- IT'S LIKE A SET
IN STONE TYPE OF THING.

06:58.876 --> 07:02.839
{\an8}- THREE HOURS TO DESIGN
AND TATTOO A [bleep] RIB PIECE,

07:02.922 --> 07:06.134
{\an8}ON A VIRGIN CANVAS,
THAT'S A MEMORIAL.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.094
IF THAT DOESN'T SHOW
ADAPTABILITY,

07:08.177 --> 07:08.886
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.642
- MAN, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO TALK.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.228
{\an8}MY ANXIETY LEVEL'S
ON LEVEL 20 RIGHT NOW.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.188
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO [bleep]
YOU OVER.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.857
I CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT

07:20.940 --> 07:22.608
BECAUSE I'M COMING OFF
A ROOFTOP.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.027
I'M ALREADY PANICKED
THE HELL OUT.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.321
IF THE JUDGES DO NOT SEE
HOW MUCH I'VE HAD TO ADAPT,

07:27.572 --> 07:30.241
THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MIND.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.244
- TWO MORE HOURS TO TATTOO.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.246
{\an8}- OOH, I THINK
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, DUDE.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.873
{\an8}- THERE'S A LOT ON THE LINE.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.125
{\an8}I GOT TWO BEAUTIFUL BOYS.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.210
ME BEING HERE AWAY FROM THEM
IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST PART.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.212
I FEEL
LIKE I'M PRETTY ADAPTABLE.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.506
IF ANYBODY
WANTS TO WIN THIS COMPETITION,

07:45.590 --> 07:45.631
THEY GOT TO COME
THROUGH ME FIRST.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.219
{\an8}- I HOPE SO.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.138
{\an8}- SO ROSE TATTOOS
ARE SO ICONIC AND SO TYPICAL,

07:52.221 --> 07:53.890
{\an8}I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.641
IT'S AN INVERTED ROSE.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.268
I REALLY NEED TO DO
WHAT I DO BEST,

07:57.351 --> 07:59.228
AND THAT'S GOOD TATTOOS.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.316
CHEMISTRY MAKES A GOOD TATTOO,
SO I KNOW WE ALREADY WON.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.319
{\an8}- AARON'S TOO BUSY
FLIRTING WITH HIS CANVAS

08:06.402 --> 08:09.405
{\an8}TO PUT A DECENT TATTOO
ON HER ARM.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.782
HE'S DOING A BLUE WHIRLPOOL.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.912
IT LOOKS LIKE SMATTERED [bleep].

08:15.995 --> 08:16.579
- ONE HOUR REMAINING.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.335
- OKAY, YOU READY? WE'RE GONNA
START DOING SOME SHADING NOW.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.212
- YEAH.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.255
- THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE
WITH THIS TATTOO

08:26.339 --> 08:27.256
BECAUSE I HAVE TO REPRESENT
THIS WOMAN'S FEELINGS,

08:27.340 --> 08:29.008
{\an8}EMOTIONS, AND HER STORY.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.469
{\an8}SO THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON IT.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.303
{\an8}IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.849
- I KNOW THAT I COULD I
BRING HER IDEA TO LIFE.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.769
{\an8}- HOW WE LOOKING?

08:41.687 --> 08:44.232
{\an8}- LAST WEEK,
I LET MY PERSONAL PROBLEMS

08:44.315 --> 08:46.859
{\an8}AFFECT HOW
I TREATED MY CANVAS.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.070
- ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT?

08:49.153 --> 08:51.239
'CAUSE YOU REALLY DIDN'T PUT
ANYTHING THAT I WANTED YOU TO.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.032
- I PUT CABLES AND METAL
IN THERE.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.700
- METAL,
BUT I SAID LIKE METAL RODS.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.952
- GOOD-BYE.
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.828
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.664
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.249
IF YOU NEED A BREAK,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

09:01.332 --> 09:01.749
I HAVE TO REDEEM MYSELF
ON THIS ONE.

09:05.461 --> 09:10.424
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.386
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN. TIME IS UP.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.388
NO MORE TATTOOING.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

09:15.471 --> 09:16.347
- YES.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.765
- TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.642
- WOW. LOOKS LIKE 3-D.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.436
- LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
- HOO.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.106
- IT LOOKS AWESOME.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.108
- JULIA AND I
BOTH GOT A SPARTAN TATTOO.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.152
{\an8}MY SPARTAN'S GONNA WHOOP
HER SPARTAN'S ASS.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
- YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
- COME HERE.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.072
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
- HAPPY FIRST TATTOO.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.995
- JULIA, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.956
IN WHAT WAYS DID YOU FOCUS ON
BEING ADAPTABLE TO YOUR CLIENT?

09:42.039 --> 09:45.751
AND THIS IS CERTAINLY
POINTED TOWARDS YOU TODAY.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.379
- AFTER I HEARD HIS STORY
OF WHY HE WANTED IT,

09:48.462 --> 09:50.214
WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA

09:50.298 --> 09:52.341
OF HAVING A REAL POSITIVE TATTOO
FOR HIM.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.343
- WELL, I THINK IT DEFINITELY
COMES OFF AS A POSITIVE DESIGN.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.470
IT DOES HAVE BRIGHT COLORS,

09:56.554 --> 09:58.389
AND IT DOES HAVE A LOT
OF CONTRAST,

09:58.472 --> 10:00.683
AND IT'S VERY CLEAN,
VERY NICELY TATTOOED.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.477
- DON, WHAT DID YOU WANT TODAY
FOR YOUR FIRST TATTOO?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.146
- TO BE AN INSPIRATION
TO MYSELF,

10:05.229 --> 10:07.106
TO ALWAYS LIVE LIKE A SPARTAN,

10:07.189 --> 10:09.275
AND HOPEFULLY TO INSPIRE MY KIDS
TO DO THE SAME.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.235
- THE SIZE OF THIS TATTOO
IS A NICE SIZE FOR HIS ARM,

10:11.319 --> 10:13.362
AND WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU

10:13.446 --> 10:15.573
AND YOUR FAMILY IS GONNA MAKE
YOU LOVE THIS TATTOO EVEN MORE.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.325
- EMILY.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.827
- SHE WANTED HER FIRST TATTOO
ON HER RIBS.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.330
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER,
SO I WAS WILLING TO ADAPT.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.332
- THE SHAPE OF THE TATTOO
FITS THE BODY NICELY,

10:24.415 --> 10:26.500
AND THE SOFT, SMOOTH,
GRAY LITTLE HEARTS

10:26.751 --> 10:28.294
THAT YOU DID AROUND IT LOOK
LIKE A NICE, SOFT ACCENT.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.379
I THINK YOU HIT IT.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.215
- MARK, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
THAT PLACEMENT?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.967
- THAT WAS ALL HER.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.677
I HAD TO ADAPT TO
WHAT SHE WANTED.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.471
- I THINK THAT THE WAY
IT SITS NOW

10:38.721 --> 10:40.056
IS PERFECT WITH THE DESIGN
OF MY ACTUAL BODY.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.141
- I REALLY LIKE THE DESIGN.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.060
I THINK IT HAS A LOT
OF GOOD FLOW, LOOKS FEMININE,

10:44.143 --> 10:45.436
AND JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF DOT PATTERN THERE

10:45.519 --> 10:46.395
REALLY MAKES IT STAND OUT.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.397
- JOSH.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.398
DID YOU ASK JOSH
FOR THESE PARTICULAR ELEMENTS?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.025
- I GAVE HIM THE MICROPHONE,

10:51.108 --> 10:53.069
AND HE JUST BROUGHT IT TO LIFE.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.820
- I HAD TO SIT THERE
AND DRAW RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM

10:54.904 --> 10:56.947
WITHOUT LOOKING
AT A BUNCH OF IMAGES

10:57.031 --> 10:58.741
AND DO A DIFFERENT STYLE THAT
I'M NOT REALLY USED TO.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.993
- GOOD JOB DOING
WHAT TATTOO ARTISTS

11:01.077 --> 11:02.411
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO
IS INTERPRET PEOPLE'S IDEAS

11:02.495 --> 11:03.412
AND DRAW IT UP ON THE SPOT.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.498
- JASON,

11:05.581 --> 11:07.541
SO DID YOU WANT BIO-MECH
INCLUDED WITH THIS DESIGN?

11:07.625 --> 11:09.293
- DEFINITELY.
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN A CHALLENGE.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.295
- YEAH,
I HAD TO ADAPT REALLY QUICK.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
- YOU DID SHOW A LOT
OF LIGHTER SHADES OF GRAY

11:13.589 --> 11:15.674
IN YOUR FOREGROUND AND THEN
YOUR HEAVIER, DEEP SET BLACKS.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.926
GOOD JOB.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.177
{\an8}- JASON'S TATTOO IS BORING.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.512
{\an8}IT'S NOT DYNAMIC.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.263
{\an8}IT'S NOT INCREDIBLY READABLE.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.973
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.017
- ERIK.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.061
WHAT ELEMENTS DID YOU TELL
ERIK THAT YOU NEEDED?

11:27.144 --> 11:29.146
- I WANTED A POCKET WATCH
TO REPRESENT MY FATHER,

11:29.230 --> 11:31.440
AND THE TIME, 9:02,
THE TIME MY SON WAS BORN.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.567
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.194
IT'S VERY FEMININE, BUT IT STILL
HAS THE MEANING FROM HER FAMILY

11:35.277 --> 11:37.029
THAT SHE WANTED IN THERE.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.489
A LOT OF DETAIL,
A LOT OF BRIGHT COLORS.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.199
- THE TATTOO FITS THE BODY WELL,

11:40.282 --> 11:41.409
AND OVERALL,
IT'S A DYNAMIC TATTOO,

11:41.492 --> 11:43.536
AND IT LOOKS GOOD.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.579
- CHRIS.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.498
- I THINK THE DETAIL
IN THIS TATTOO IS VERY NICE.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.958
VERY CLOSE-UP,
YOU SEE THE STITCHING

11:49.041 --> 11:50.584
IN THE FABRIC AND THE WRINKLES.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.503
THERE'S A NICE CONTRAST.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.588
WITH IT JUST
BEING BLACK AND GRAY,

11:54.672 --> 11:56.590
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
TO LET THE BLUE AND THE RED

11:56.674 --> 11:58.467
AND THE WHITE ALL KIND
OF HAVE A DIFFERENT TONE,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.219
AND I FEEL LIKE
YOU CAPTURED THAT.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.138
- AARON.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.181
- I THINK IT'S A VERY UNIQUE
TATTOO.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.599
I FEEL LIKE IT'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT

12:05.683 --> 12:06.350
THAN WHAT ANYBODY EXPECTED.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.436
{\an8}- I LOOK AT AARON'S TATTOO,

12:08.519 --> 12:10.438
{\an8}AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL
WHAT THE HELL IT IS.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.023
HE DEFINITELY RUINED
THIS GIRL'S ARM FOR GOOD.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.817
- CLEEN.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.902
- I ALWAYS WANTED
SOMETHING TRIBAL,

12:16.986 --> 12:18.529
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS
WAS GETTING MY KIDS

12:18.612 --> 12:20.406
SOMEHOW INCORPORATED.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.615
- THE DETAILS ARE REALLY NICE
AND CLEAN.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.576
THE BLACK IS REALLY SOLID,

12:23.659 --> 12:24.493
REALLY LOVE THE WAY
IT FITS THE ARM.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.620
IT'S A COOL TATTOO, MAN.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.456
- CLEEN'S TATTOO
IS NOT ACCURATE.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.540
IT'S NOT TRADITIONALLY
POLYNESIAN TRIBAL.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.959
{\an8}MY ROSE WHUPS THE [bleep] OUT

12:32.042 --> 12:33.627
{\an8}OF CLEEN'S
WRONG POLYNESIAN TRIBAL.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.381
{\an8}- IT BLOWS MY [bleep] MIND
HOW ARROGANT YOU ARE.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.383
{\an8}- YOU'LL BE GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD,

12:39.467 --> 12:41.010
BUT THERE IS A TWIST.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.095
- GOD.
- WHAT?

12:49.226 --> 12:52.897
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE'RE TESTING
ADAPTABILITY ON VIRGIN SKIN.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.566
ERIK'S TATTOO, THE CLOCK
WITH THE LITTLE FLOWER PETALS,

12:55.649 --> 12:57.401
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY NICE.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.361
- BY BREAKING IT UP
WITH THE FLOWERS,

12:59.445 --> 13:01.614
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW
THE ENTIRE POCKET WATCH.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.908
THIS IS A QUALITY,
WALK-IN TATTOO.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.451
- CLEEN, I THINK,
SHOWED SOME GREAT ADAPTABILITY.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.453
- THE WAY IT FITS HIS ARM

13:07.536 --> 13:09.538
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S
SUCH AN INTERESTING SHAPE,

13:09.622 --> 13:10.706
I THINK IT'S VERY WELL PUT
TOGETHER.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.708
- OVERALL IN THIS COMPETITION,

13:12.791 --> 13:14.543
HE'S SHOWED NOTHING
BUT ADAPTABILITY,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.587
AND TODAY IT'S JUST PAR
FOR THE COURSE.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.422
- AND SPEAKING TO ADAPTABILITY,
CHRIS DID A REALLY GOOD JOB.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.591
THE HEAVY BLACK IN THIS TATTOO

13:20.674 --> 13:22.968
IN CONTRAST WITH THE DIFFERENT
TONES OF GRAY SHOW THE RED

13:23.052 --> 13:25.221
AND THE WHITE AND STILL SHOW
THE SHADING IN THE STRIPES

13:25.304 --> 13:26.972
AND PULLED OFF
SOME REALLY NICE TRICKS.

13:27.056 --> 13:27.973
I THINK WE HAVE A DECISION,
RIGHT?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.391
- WE DO.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.643
- OKAY, LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.648
- TODAY, YOU HAD
TO SHOW ADAPTABILITY

13:35.731 --> 13:38.567
BY GIVING CANVASES
THEIR VERY FIRST TATTOOS.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE <i> MAS</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:43.906
EVERYDAY BY SEEKING
MEMORABLE LIFE EXPERIENCES.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.783
SOME OF YOU
SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY

13:45.866 --> 13:48.244
TO CREATE AMAZING WORK.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.955
- ERIK, YOU DID A REALLY NICE
TATTOO, LOTS OF LITTLE TRICKS

13:51.038 --> 13:53.165
AND APPEALING TO THE EYE.
- THANK YOU.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.585
- CLEEN, YOU TOOK IMAGERY THAT
YOU'RE NOT 100% FAMILIAR WITH,

13:56.669 --> 13:58.671
AND MAKING A COOL DESIGN
FOR THIS GUY

13:58.754 --> 14:01.173
IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF ADAPTABILITY.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.425
CHRIS, IT DEFINITELY
HAD THE RIGHT AMOUNT

14:03.509 --> 14:05.636
OF CONTRAST FOR THIS
TO STAND OUT AS A STRONG BLACK

14:05.719 --> 14:08.097
AND GRAY TATTOO.
GOOD JOB.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.391
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THE WINNER

14:10.474 --> 14:12.851
OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

14:15.688 --> 14:17.731
ERIK.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.692
- GIVING THIS GIRL A NICE,
FEMININE, BEAUTIFUL TATTOO

14:19.775 --> 14:21.610
THAT SHE'S GONNA BE HAPPY WITH,
JOB WELL DONE.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.988
- YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

14:24.071 --> 14:25.781
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.158
{\an8}- THERE'S NOTHING SUPER FLASHY
ABOUT ERIK'S TATTOO.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.744
{\an8}ALL IT IS IS A REAL CHEESY CLOCK
WITH SOME FLOWERS.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.621
I DEFINITELY SHOULD'VE WON.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.748
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

14:34.832 --> 14:36.125
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.755
- SO WHAT'S UP
WITH THE SKULL PICK?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.008
- I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
BE PLAYING MY CARDS RIGHT.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.093
THERE'S CERTAIN PEOPLE
THAT ARE HOLDING ON BY A THREAD,

14:46.176 --> 14:47.970
AND THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO START
GETTING WEEDED OUT.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.305
- SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY GONNA BE
CUTTHROAT.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.265
- I'M GONNA BE STRATEGIC

14:51.348 --> 14:52.725
BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE
TO PROVE THEIR WORTH.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.602
- I'M DEFINITELY EXCITED TO SEE

14:54.685 --> 14:56.478
WHAT CHALLENGE
YOU CAN PUT IN FRONT OF ME.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.397
- BASICALLY,
IF YOU SURPRISE ME TOMORROW

14:58.480 --> 15:00.024
AND YOU DO A SICK TATTOO
ON A HARD CANVAS,

15:00.107 --> 15:01.483
LET'S JUST SAY--
- I'M DOWN.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.277
- RIB, NECK, WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.279
- I LIKE THE CHALLENGE.
I FEEL LIKE--

15:05.362 --> 15:07.448
- YEAH, BUT EVERY TIME
YOU GET THE HARDEST SKULL

15:07.531 --> 15:09.491
YOU ALWAYS CHANGE IT AND TURN IT
INTO THE EASIEST TATTOO.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.201
- THAT'S 'CAUSE IT'S STILL
A CHALLENGE TO MOVE IT.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.412
- HOW'S IT A CHALLENGE
TO MOVE IT?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.497
- BECAUSE IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU KNOW IS GONNA WORK

15:15.581 --> 15:16.749
BETTER IN ANOTHER SPOT--
- YOU GOT A SILVER TONGUE.

15:16.832 --> 15:16.874
YOU TALK THEM INTO IT.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.752
{\an8}- YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.670
{\an8}YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE
DYNAMICS OF THIS COMPETITION.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.048
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO MAKE
EVERY SITUATION WORK FOR ME.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.466
- I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU DO
A CANVAS THAT'S GIVEN TO YOU

15:25.549 --> 15:26.842
AND NOT CHANGE THE LOCATION.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.719
THAT'S IT.
- OKAY.

15:28.802 --> 15:29.762
- COOL.
- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.764
- YOU'RE [bleep] ARROGANT DUDE.

15:32.014 --> 15:32.222
IT BLOWS MY [bleep] MIND
HOW ARROGANT YOU ARE.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.447
- WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.199
IF YOU SCREW THIS UP,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.159
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR SHOT
AT $100,000,

15:52.242 --> 15:53.786
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

15:53.869 --> 15:56.705
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.167
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF,

16:00.250 --> 16:02.711
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.631
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.467
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

16:08.550 --> 16:12.221
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

16:12.304 --> 16:14.890
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.851
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

16:17.935 --> 16:19.728
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.648
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING YOUR ADAPTABILITY.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.817
{\an8}- ADAPTABILITY IS THE ABILITY
TO WORK WITH ANY CANVAS

16:25.067 --> 16:28.654
{\an8}AND DO ANY STYLE TATTOO
ON ANY PART OF THE BODY.

16:28.737 --> 16:32.741
- TODAY, YOU'LL BE GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD ON THE SAME CANVAS

16:32.825 --> 16:34.451
AT THE SAME TIME.
- WHAT?

16:34.535 --> 16:38.747
- BECAUSE YOU MUST CREATE...

16:38.831 --> 16:41.542
INTERLOCKING TATTOOS.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.293
[murmuring]

16:43.377 --> 16:45.838
{\an8}- THIS IS CRAZY. I'VE NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.299
- EACH OF YOU MUST TATTOO ONE
OF YOUR CANVASES FOREARMS.

16:49.383 --> 16:53.178
NOT ONLY MUST EACH FOREARM STAND
ALONE AS A COMPLETE PIECE,

16:53.262 --> 16:56.640
BUT WHEN YOUR CANVASES FOREARMS
ARE TOUCHING, BOTH TATTOOS

16:56.724 --> 17:01.562
MUST SEAMLESS CONNECT TO CREATE
ONE LARGER, IMPRESSIVE IMAGE.

17:01.645 --> 17:02.938
- WHAT THE HELL?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.897
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO ADAPT
TO THE CANVAS'S NEEDS,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.942
{\an8}ADAPT IN THE DRAWING STYLES,

17:07.025 --> 17:09.653
{\an8}ADAPT IN THE FACT THAT
THESE HAVE TO FORM TOGETHER.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.446
THIS IS JUST A CLUSTER [bleep]
OF ALL KINDS OF ADAPTABILITY.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.324
{\an8}- YEAH.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.034
- YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.872
IF YOU DO NOT MATCH,
YOU ARE OUT.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.707
- THIS TATTOO
IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.791
{\an8}ON ONE HAND, I WANT A TEAMMATE
THAT CAN LINE UP A TATTOO

17:23.876 --> 17:25.335
{\an8}AND DO PERFECTLY,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

17:25.419 --> 17:26.878
{\an8}I WANT SOMEBODY THAT I CAN BEAT.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.756
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.553
ERIK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:34.636 --> 17:37.556
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

17:37.639 --> 17:41.727
AND DETERMINE WHO TATTOOS
HEAD-TO-HEAD ON THE SAME CANVAS.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.396
- OH, YOU'RE ALL [bleep].

17:44.480 --> 17:46.857
MY STRATEGY IS TO MATCH UP
A STRONGER TATTOOER

17:46.940 --> 17:47.983
AGAINST A LESSER TATTOOER.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.902
{\an8}I'M GUNNING FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED

17:49.985 --> 17:52.571
{\an8}TO PROVE THAT THEY NEED
TO BELONG IN THIS COMPETITION.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.281
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.074
- TWO SNAKES
THAT'LL BE ONE SNAKE

17:56.158 --> 17:57.785
WHENEVER YOU PUT THE ARMS
TOGETHER.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.328
{\an8}- THIS SNAKE TATTOO'S
NOT GONNA WORK.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.788
{\an8}HOW DOES THAT TURN
INTO ONE TATTOO HERE?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.581
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO?

18:02.664 --> 18:03.832
- A DAY OF THE DEAD BRIDE
AND GROOM.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.834
- I WANT TWO DRAGONS FIGHTING.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.961
- AN INTERLOCKING PEACOCK,
SO THE BIRD ON ONE ARM,

18:08.045 --> 18:09.838
AND THE FEATHERS
ON THE OTHER ARM.

18:09.922 --> 18:10.964
- WHAT IS THAT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.841
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.510
- HOW DO YOU PUT A PEACOCK HEAD
ON ONE SIDE

18:14.593 --> 18:16.011
{\an8}AND HIS TAIL FEATHERS
ON THE OTHER?

18:16.095 --> 18:16.845
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY
TO MAKE THAT LOOK GOOD.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.016
{\an8}- I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO
AGAINST ANYBODY HEAD-TO-HEAD.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.726
{\an8}THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT I'M GONNA BEAT OUT

18:22.810 --> 18:23.101
{\an8}WHOEVER I GET STUCK
WITH.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.903
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:33.153 --> 18:36.406
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULLS.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.574
- MARK.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.867
- HERE.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.870
- AND DON.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.624
- JOSH.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.376
JULIA.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.044
{\an8}- ERIK THINKS THAT
HE'S SCREWING ME OVER

18:49.127 --> 18:49.920
{\an8}BY PUTTING ME WITH JULIA.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.050
BUT IT'S GONNA BE AN EASY WIN.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.593
- EMILY.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.011
- AND?

18:58.095 --> 18:58.637
- AND AARON.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.518
- ERIK STICKS ME WITH MY RIVAL,
AARON. PRICK.

19:04.601 --> 19:08.897
{\an8}AT LEAST NOW I CAN PUT HIS ASS
IN THE DIRT WHERE HE BELONGS.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.899
- ERIK.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.067
CLEEN ROCK ONE.
- THAT'S ME.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.069
- CALLING OUT THE BIG DOGS.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.779
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH CLEEN TODAY 'CAUSE

19:15.863 --> 19:17.447
{\an8}I CAME HERE
TO GO AGAINST THE BEST,

19:17.531 --> 19:20.033
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS
AND PROVE WHO I AM.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.704
- JASON AND CHRIS.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.622
- ALL RIGHT, DUDE.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.583
- REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:27.666 --> 19:29.918
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:30.002 --> 19:32.462
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST
AND PUT ONE ARTIST

19:32.546 --> 19:34.590
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.051
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE INTERLOCKING TATTOOS,

19:38.135 --> 19:41.346
AND BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.808
GOOD LUCK.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.935
{\an8}- THESE ARTISTS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO SHOW ADAPTABILITY

19:47.019 --> 19:49.605
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING FROM THE DRAWING...

19:49.688 --> 19:51.315
- HOW'S IT GOING? CLEEN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.774
- TO ACTUALLY APPLYING
THE STENCIL

19:52.858 --> 19:54.776
TO COLOR PALETTES, EXECUTION.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.070
IF ONE ARTIST IS WEAKER,
IT'S REALLY GONNA SHOW.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.072
- ONE SNAKE ON EACH ARM.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.075
WHENEVER I PUT FOREARMS
TOGETHER, IT'LL WRAP UP.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.328
- MY CANVAS WANTS A INTERLOCKING
TATTOO OF A SNAKE,

20:04.411 --> 20:05.787
{\an8}BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY
HE WANTS IT,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.122
{\an8}IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO DO.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.458
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.710
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
THAT WORKS BEST FOR ME AND LEAD

20:11.793 --> 20:14.963
{\an1}US INTO A SITUATION THAT'S GONNA
BE BENEFICIAL FOR THIS TATTOO.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.090
- MAYBE LIKE ANGEL-TYPE THING
ON ONE SIDE AND THEN

20:17.174 --> 20:18.091
LIKE A DEMON ON THE OTHER.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.885
- YEAH.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.721
- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS
BESIDES JUST TWO BIRDS?

20:22.804 --> 20:24.890
{\an8}- EMILY SHOULD ALREADY BE GONE.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.601
- LET'S DO A SIAMESE PEACOCK.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.646
- I'D RATHER HAVE THE ROOT CANAL
AND GET HIT BY A JET SKI

20:30.729 --> 20:33.148
THAN HAVE TO WORK WITH EMILY,
WITH THIS SILLY-ASS IDEA.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.150
- SORRY.
[chuckles]

20:35.233 --> 20:37.611
- LET ME JUST HEAR EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANTED AGAIN.

20:37.694 --> 20:41.615
- TWO DRAGONS FIGHTING, LIKE A
CHINESE, ORIENTAL-STYLE DRAGON.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.408
- KIND OF.
I LIKE THE DIFFERENT

20:43.492 --> 20:44.910
TYPE OF GODZILLA MONSTERS.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.662
- SO MORE MEDIEVAL LOOKING?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.830
- NOT MEDIEVAL,
JUST SOMETHING UNIQUE.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.083
- I AM SO FREAKING STRESSED
OUT OF MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.794
- WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT
IS BLACK DRAGONS.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.087
DO YOU FOLLOW ME?
- YEAH.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.547
- DO YOU LIKE THE IDEAS OF THAT?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.424
{\an8}IF YOU'RE GONNA COME
AND ASK ME FOR A TATTOO,

20:59.508 --> 21:02.803
{\an8}YOU BETTER OPEN YOUR MOUTH
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.930
{\an8}I'M GONNA SPEND
ALL NIGHT DRAWING THIS,

21:05.013 --> 21:07.140
AND IF YOU COME IN HERE
AND WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE,

21:07.224 --> 21:09.393
YOU'RE GONNA [bleep] ME
OUT OF A $100,000 TATTOO.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.228
THERE'S PEOPLE YOU DON'T WANT
TO [bleep] WITH IN LIFE.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.938
YOUR HEART SURGEON,
YOUR HAIR STYLIST,

21:13.021 --> 21:14.231
AND DON'T [bleep]
WITH YOUR TATTOO ARTIST.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.782
- WHAT'S HAPPENING, GUYS?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.617
- I LIKE THE LOOK
OF THIS DRAGON,

21:25.701 --> 21:27.869
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING
WITH TWO DRAGONS,

21:27.953 --> 21:32.124
IF WE CAN GO WITH ONE DRAGON
CONNECTING BETWEEN THE TWO ARMS.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.126
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD
SINGULARLY ON THEIR OWN.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.211
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ONE ARM
THAT JUST HAS SOME PARTS

21:36.461 --> 21:37.629
OF BODY ON IT. IT'S JUST--

21:37.713 --> 21:38.922
- THIS IS LIKE MAYBE--

21:39.006 --> 21:41.174
THIS PART HAS THE HEAD

21:41.258 --> 21:43.176
AND THEN GOES THROUGH LIKE SOME
SORT OF HOLE OR--I DON'T KNOW.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.846
AND THEN, LIKE,
IT WOULD HAVE SOME WINGS,

21:45.929 --> 21:49.349
AND THEN GO BACK AROUND
TO THE BOTTOM PART AND--

21:49.433 --> 21:51.184
- IS IT YOUR GOAL TODAY
TO GIVE ME

21:51.435 --> 21:53.145
A GODDAMN HEART ATTACK
OR WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

21:53.437 --> 21:55.522
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU A HEART ATTACK.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.482
- OKAY. WELL, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, BRO.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.609
- I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S GONNA
BE KIND OF BIG.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.944
- YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.
LET'S GIVE YOU A BIG BOY TATTOO

22:01.028 --> 22:03.196
AND MAKE IT BADASS.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.073
THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE
TO TRUST YOUR TATTOO ARTIST.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.616
{\an8}YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN,
SHUT THE [bleep] UP,

22:06.700 --> 22:09.703
{\an8}AND HOLD ON FOR THE RIDE.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.872
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WE CAN DO IT.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.999
- WE GOOD?
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.083
- I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.835
- ALL RIGHT.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.004
- TODAY YOU MUST SHOW
ADAPTABILITY

22:19.087 --> 22:21.715
BY TATTOOING
AN INTERLOCKING DESIGN.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.258
YOU HAVE SIX HOURS,

22:23.508 --> 22:27.179
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.139
- ALL RIGHT, BRAH.
- LET'S DO IT.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.183
- LET'S DO THIS.
- GET THAT STENCIL ON,

22:31.266 --> 22:32.601
AND THEN I'LL GET MINE ON,
AND THEN WE'RE JAMMING.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.227
{\an8}- CREATING INTERLOCKING TATTOOS

22:34.519 --> 22:37.105
{\an8}MAKES THIS THE ULTIMATE
CHALLENGE FOR ADAPTABILITY.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.732
{\an8}- SO I SHOULD PUT HER LIKE THIS.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.484
- JUST RIGHT DOWN THAT LINE.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.778
- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

22:42.861 --> 22:44.613
TO MAKE SURE YOUR COLOR PALETTES
MATCH, YOUR LINE WEIGHTS MATCH,

22:44.696 --> 22:46.531
SO IT LOOKS
LIKE ONE PERSON DID THIS.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.991
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP,
HAVE HIM GET UP

22:48.075 --> 22:49.534
AND COINCIDE A FEW TIMES, OKAY?

22:49.618 --> 22:50.452
- OKAY.
- READY, PARTNER?

22:50.535 --> 22:50.994
- YEP.

22:55.415 --> 22:59.753
{\an8}- I'M SCULPTING THE SKULL JUST
A LITTLE BIT ON THE OUTER EDGE.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.213
{\an8}GETTING PAIRED UP WITH ERIK

23:01.463 --> 23:03.006
{\an8}MEANS I'M GONNA
DO A BAD-ASS TATTOO WITH HIM,

23:03.090 --> 23:04.132
{\an8}BUT GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.802
{\an8}I KNOW I'M THE STRONGER ARTIST.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.595
THANKS FOR PICKING ME, ERIK.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.722
I APPRECIATE IT.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.389
HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.604
- FIVE HOURS TO GO.

23:17.687 --> 23:22.901
FIVE MORE HOURS.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.278
- ARE WE DOING THAT LITTLE BIT
AT THE TIP SOLID BLACK?

23:25.362 --> 23:27.155
OR ARE WE LEAVING IT OPEN?
- MINE'S OPEN.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.074
{\an8}I KNOW FOR A FACT

23:29.157 --> 23:30.784
{\an8}THAT I CAN BEAT OUT AARON
IN THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.120
{\an8}I CAME HERE TO BEAT MY RIVAL.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.997
NOW IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
SURE THAT AARON GOES HOME.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.916
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.251
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO ABOUT BACKGROUND?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.086
- I DON'T KNOW YET, EMILY.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.963
{\an8}I NOT ONLY HAVE
TO WORK WITH MY RIVAL,

23:43.046 --> 23:44.673
{\an8}BUT I HAVE TO BEAT HER.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.091
{\an8}I SPENT THE BETTER PART
OF FIVE YEARS TAKING CARE

23:46.174 --> 23:48.093
{\an8}OF MY EX,
WHO I ENDED UP MARRYING,

23:48.176 --> 23:49.219
{\an8}AND THEN WITHIN A YEAR OF THAT,

23:49.469 --> 23:51.012
{\an8}SHE WALKED OUT ON ME.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.931
NOW, I DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME

23:53.014 --> 23:54.182
TO LOOK OUT
FOR MYSELF AND MY OWN CAREER.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.725
{\an8}I'VE GOT
A TINY BIT MORE SCULPTING

23:55.809 --> 23:55.851
{\an8}IN SOME OF THESE FEATHERS.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.773
- I NEED TO GO FORWARD,
AND I NEED TO BE HAULING ASS

24:01.857 --> 24:05.277
BECAUSE I'M NOT LETTING
ANYONE SLOW ME DOWN EVER AGAIN.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.486
- THREE HOURS REMAINING.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.577
{\an8}- I AM SO FREAKING STRESSED
OUT OF MY MIND.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.829
LAST TIME
I COMPETED IN THIS COMPETITION,

24:15.912 --> 24:18.540
I STARTED EXPERIENCING MAJOR
PANIC ATTACKS, BUT NOT AGAIN.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- NOTHING.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.209
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.295
THERE IS $100,000 ON THE LINE,

24:23.378 --> 24:25.297
AND I HAVE TO OVERCOME
MY ANXIETY RIGHT NOW.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.340
- YOU THINK I SHOULD DO
THE CLOUDS OVER HERE?

24:27.424 --> 24:28.300
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU GOT TO DO THEM

24:28.550 --> 24:30.385
WHERE THEY LINE UP, DUDE.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.345
I JUST NEED TO SHAKE
ALL THIS PANIC OFF

24:32.429 --> 24:34.222
AND JUST DO A REALLY KICK-ASS
TATTOO.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.184
- YEAH. SO FILL
THAT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.351
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL
IS MARK TRYING TO DO?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.395
{\an8}COMPLETELY
CHANGE THE BACKGROUND.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.105
I HAVE TO ADD MORE ROWS
OF CLOUDS JUST SO

24:42.189 --> 24:43.398
THE TATTOOS MATCH UP AGAIN.

24:43.481 --> 24:44.566
I AM PISSED.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.818
- WHAT HAPPENED?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.695
- MARK CHANGED THE BACKGROUND
HALFWAY THROUGH THE TATTOO.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.405
- WELL, GO BACK INTO YOUR INK.
MATCH IT UP.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.616
HAVE HIM HOLD THEM
LIKE THAT REAL QUICK.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.451
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
WE JUST KEPT COMPARING THEM.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.744
DON'S GOT A PROBLEM
WITH HIS TEAMMATE.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.662
WHY IS HE TELLING ME?

24:57.746 --> 24:58.997
JUST THROW IN THE TOWEL
AND SAY [bleep] IT.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.874
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, DON?

25:00.957 --> 25:02.417
- FINAL HOUR, ONE HOUR TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

25:07.422 --> 25:10.383
{\an8}- YOU'RE DOING DARK HAIR, RIGHT?
- DARK HAIR, YEAH.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.843
{\an8}- IT'S NERVE-WRACKING KNOWING

25:11.927 --> 25:13.178
{\an8}I HAVE TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JOSH.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.388
HE IS A PORTRAIT ARTIST,

25:15.472 --> 25:17.432
AND I'VE ONLY DONE
A FEW PORTRAITS.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.434
ARE YOU PUTTING WHITE HIGHLIGHTS
IN YOURS?

25:19.517 --> 25:21.436
- IN A FEW PLACES.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.772
- HE'S JUST GIVING ME A LOT
OF POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT,

25:23.855 --> 25:26.316
AND I FEEL REALLY GOOD
ABOUT MY TATTOO.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.109
HEY, JOSH.
- YO.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.654
- DO YOU WANT TO PEEK
AT MINE SO FAR?

25:30.737 --> 25:31.988
- JESUS CHRIST.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.157
{\an8}JULIA, DO A TATTOO ON YOUR OWN.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.910
{\an8}DO NOT RELY ON ME
TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH IT.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.913
{\an8}- DO YOU THINK SHE NEEDS
A HIGHLIGHT IN HER LIPS?

25:39.996 --> 25:41.456
- HMM?
YOU SHOULD KNOW THESE THINGS

25:41.539 --> 25:43.458
ALREADY ON YOUR OWN,

25:43.541 --> 25:45.543
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEN YOU SHOULD BE ELIMINATED.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.296
- DID YOU GO LOOK AT JULIA'S?
- NO.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.341
- HOLY [bleep].
SOMEBODY'S PROBABLY GOING HOME.

25:51.591 --> 25:55.303
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

25:55.387 --> 25:57.389
SIX, FIVE,

25:57.472 --> 25:58.431
FOUR,

25:58.515 --> 25:59.391
THREE,

25:59.474 --> 26:01.393
TWO, ONE.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.603
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN, TIME IS UP.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.230
NO MORE TATTOOING.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.564
- YOU DID GOOD, KID.

26:06.648 --> 26:07.148
YOU DID GOOD.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.404
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- IT'S AWESOME, MAN. GOOD JOB.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.364
- CHRIS,
WHO DOESN'T EVEN DO JAPANESE,

26:14.614 --> 26:16.700
DID A WAY
BETTER TATTOO THAN JASON.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.828
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HIS ANXIETY
IS GETTING TO HIM AGAIN.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.705
HE'S SLIPPING.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.123
HE'S DEFINITELY NOT PERFORMING
AT THE LEVEL

26:23.206 --> 26:24.332
THAT HE THINKS THAT HE CAN.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.167
YOU WANT TO BE INK MASTER?

26:26.251 --> 26:27.002
NOT GONNA HAPPEN THIS WAY,
BUDDY.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.089
{\an8}- YOU'RE [bleep].
- [bleep] YOU, AARON.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.465
{\an8}YOU [bleep] THAT UP.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.384
- YOU'RE DEFINITELY OUTCLASSED.

26:34.467 --> 26:34.509
- I'M PRETTY LET DOWN
ON THIS ONE.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.641
- SO WHICH ONE OF YOU GUYS
IS GOING HOME?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.310
- NOT ME.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.270
- THAT'S A TOUGH ONE, MAN.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.022
BOTH YOUR OUTLINES
ON THOSE FEATHERS SUCKED.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.732
- I RELAXED
ON MY TECHNICAL ASPECTS

26:48.815 --> 26:51.276
TO MIMIC HER [bleep] UPS.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.445
- BUT WHY WOULD YOU MIMIC
A [bleep] UP?

26:53.528 --> 26:55.071
- SO BOTH OF THE BOTTOMS
OF THE FEATHERS LOOKED THE SAME.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.364
- BULL [bleep].
YOU SHOULD'VE--

26:56.448 --> 26:57.949
- YOU--WAIT A MINUTE.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.868
WAIT A MINUTE.
SHUT UP, CLEEN.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.119
YOU JUST MAKE UP
WHATEVER STORIES YOU WANT.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.871
[bleep] YOU, AARON.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.706
YOU [bleep] THAT UP.
- WHAT STORIES?

27:04.789 --> 27:06.374
- BUT YOURS WAS [bleep] UP
JUST AS BAD.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.543
- WHAT DID I--
HOW DID I DO IT TO YOURS?

27:08.626 --> 27:10.420
- SHUT UP, CLEEN.
MY OUTLINE LOOKED GREAT.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.881
- DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?
- I DON'T THINK--HONESTLY,

27:12.964 --> 27:14.174
EMILY, I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE
OF OUR OUTLINES LOOKED "GREAT."

27:14.257 --> 27:16.217
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.094
- I'M NOT HERE TO IMPRESS
CLEEN [bleep] ROCK ONE.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.180
- WELL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
- NO, BUT YOU

27:20.263 --> 27:22.432
ARE IN A COMPETITION
WHEN I'M IN THIS COMPETITION.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.517
- YES, I AM, WHERE JUDGES JUDGE
ME AND NOT YOUR [bleep] ASS.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.478
- ALL I KNOW IS YOU'RE
JUST MAKING MY JOB A LOT EASIER.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.480
- THIS IS THE TATTOO

27:28.730 --> 27:30.774
THAT I'M THE MOST PROUD OF
ON THIS COMPETITION.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.525
- WELL, THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES
I'M THE LEAST PROUD OF.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.444
- I'M PROUD OF MY WORK.
- THE SAME TATTOO--

27:34.694 --> 27:36.404
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ME--

27:36.488 --> 27:37.364
- HOLD ON.
LET SOMEBODY ELSE TALK.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.823
- SO [bleep] TALK.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.992
- IF THIS IS THE TATTOO

27:41.076 --> 27:43.036
THAT YOU'RE MOST PROUD OF
IN THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION,

27:43.119 --> 27:44.954
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH ON PAR
WITH THE BULL[bleep]

27:45.038 --> 27:45.246
I'M NOT PROUD OF TODAY,
THEN YOU'RE [bleep].

27:58.134 --> 28:00.345
- TODAY YOU HAD
TO SHOW ADAPTABILITY

28:00.428 --> 28:05.308
BY WORKING WITH ANOTHER ARTIST
TO MAKE INTERLOCKING TATTOOS.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.353
JOSH AND JULIA,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.438
THESE TWO DESIGNS,
WHEN THEY ARE INTERLOCKED,

28:10.522 --> 28:13.566
THEY DON'T SEEM TO GO TOGETHER
AS WELL AS THEY COULD.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.819
- I DISAGREE.
I FELT LIKE THE ANGELIC FACE,

28:15.902 --> 28:18.029
WE WANTED TO KEEP VERY LIGHT
AND AIRY.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.448
OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU GO DARK,
THEN IT WON'T HAVE THAT CONTRAST

28:20.532 --> 28:22.534
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE GOOD
AND EVIL.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.577
- THAT'S WHERE THE ADAPTABILITY
PART OF THIS CHALLENGE

28:24.661 --> 28:26.579
WOULD COME IN BECAUSE THE IDEA
WAS TO MAKE IT LOOK

28:26.663 --> 28:29.082
AS THOUGH IT WAS
ONE CONNECTING FLOWING PIECE.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.584
JULIA.
- THE DETAIL IS NOT VERY NICE.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.378
THE WHOLE SHAPE OF HER HEAD;

28:33.461 --> 28:35.547
THAT JUST LOOKS
LIKE A WEIRD BIG TOE.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.465
- I TRACED IT
FROM THE ACTUAL PICTURE.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.592
- THEN WHY DO THE EYES
LOOK CROOKED?

28:39.676 --> 28:41.302
- I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED REALLY GOOD

28:41.386 --> 28:43.430
WHEN I DID IT.
- LOOK AT THE NOSE.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.181
SHE HAS NO NOSE BONE.
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHADE A FACE,

28:45.265 --> 28:46.433
UNDERSTAND WHERE
THE SHADING GOES.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.475
DON'T JUST WING IT.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.602
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO JOSH.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.312
- TECHNICALLY,
IT'S REALLY SMOOTH,

28:51.396 --> 28:52.564
AND I KNOW IT'
SUPPOSED TO BE EVIL,

28:52.647 --> 28:54.566
BUT IT IS REALLY DARK.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.651
YOU GOT THE ROPE,
SKIN, THE HAIR, AND THE HORNS.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.653
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS

28:58.736 --> 29:01.197
SHOULD BE TONALLY DIFFERENT
SOMEHOW.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.867
- THE OTHER THING IS THE EYES
AREN'T THE SAME.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.077
- WELL, NOBODY'S EYES
ARE EVER THE SAME, SO FOR ME

29:06.161 --> 29:08.204
TO MAKE THEM PERFECT IS--
- YEAH, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSES.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.123
THEY'RE JUST THE ONLY HIGHLIGHTS
IN THE ENTIRE TATTOO,

29:10.206 --> 29:12.834
SO THEY STICK OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.627
- FINAL DECISION.
- JOSH.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.045
- JOSH.
- JOSH.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.213
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.674
- THANK YOU.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.552
- CLEEN AND ERIK.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.305
{\an8}- FIRST, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE INTERLOCKING ASPECT.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.515
{\an8}IT IS A NICE, SUBTLE TOUCH

29:27.599 --> 29:29.058
{\an8}TO JUST HAVE
THE SMOKE DRIFT ACROSS.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.226
{\an8}THEY GO TOGETHER REALLY WELL,

29:30.310 --> 29:31.936
{\an8}AND THEY'RE BOTH STRONG.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.480
- LET'S MOVE
INTO SPECIFIC TATTOOS,

29:33.563 --> 29:35.482
AND LET'S START WITH CLEEN.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.650
- NICE, SOLID TATTOO.
SATURATION OF THE BLACK,

29:37.901 --> 29:39.652
AND THAT BLUE IN THE HAT

29:39.944 --> 29:42.655
WITH THE CONTRAST
OF THE RED HATBAND IS VERY NICE.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.699
DID YOU PUT YOUR TWO FRONT TEETH
IN THIS SKULL?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.201
- ALWAYS.
TRADEMARK, BABY.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.577
- YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY CUTE.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.079
- LET'S CONTINUE ON WITH ERIC.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.332
- I LIKE THE DESIGN
OF THE TATTOO.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.000
I LIKE THE WAY THAT THE HAIR
AND THE FEATHERS KIND OF PLAY

29:54.083 --> 29:55.960
OFF EACH OTHER.
HOT AND COLD.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.670
THE WHOLE TATTOO
JUST WORKS REALLY WELL, MAN.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.923
- NOW WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO POLL THE JUDGES

30:00.006 --> 30:02.550
AND SEE WHO WINS THIS FACE-OFF
BETWEEN CLEEN AND ERIK.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.469
{\an8}- WELL, ERIK, SATURATION-WISE
AND COLOR-WISE,

30:04.552 --> 30:06.721
{\an8}YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OUTSHINED.
I'M GONNA GO WITH CLEEN.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.556
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO WITH CLEEN
AS WELL.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
- CLEEN.
- THE WINNER OF THE FACE-OFF

30:10.433 --> 30:13.186
IS CLEEN.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.688
- EMILY AND AARON.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.483
{\an8}- IT'S A TOUGH ARTISTIC CHOICE
TO SHOW ADAPTABILITY.

30:18.566 --> 30:20.693
{\an8}- IT LOOKS LIKE THIS PEACOCK
LOOKED INTO A MIRROR

30:20.777 --> 30:25.281
{\an8}IS SO HIDEOUS
THAT IT SHATTERED THE MIRROR.

30:25.365 --> 30:26.574
- LET'S MOVE
INTO EMILY'S TATTOO.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.952
I LOVE THE HEAD ON THIS PEACOCK.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.745
THERE'S SOME NICE DETAIL

30:30.828 --> 30:32.664
HAPPENING IN THE FACE
OF THIS BIRD.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.166
- IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT
THIS MUCH DETAIL INTO THE HEAD,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.335
THEN WHY NOT THE FEATHERS?

30:37.418 --> 30:40.088
- WE WERE DEFINITELY GOING
FOR A STYLIZED LOOK ON IT.

30:40.171 --> 30:44.467
- YOU TOOK A VERY GRADE SCHOOL
ATTEMPT AT THOSE.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.345
- AARON.
- IF YOU'RE ASKED FOR A MIRROR

30:47.428 --> 30:50.765
AND FEATHERS,
IT HAS TO BE COMPLETELY LEGIBLE.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.141
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.435
EMILY'S PEACOCK IS A PEACOCK.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.604
IT IS LEGIBLE.
- IT WAS TOUGH.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.773
IT WAS TOUGH COMING UP
WITH A DESIGN AND LAYOUT.

30:58.856 --> 31:00.149
- MAYBE IF YOU DID A SMALLER
MIRROR WITH A HANDLE ON IT

31:00.233 --> 31:02.360
AND WRAPPED FEATHERS AROUND IT,

31:02.443 --> 31:03.736
AND DID A REALLY ORNATE HANDLE
AND DO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.781
THAT IS YOUR GAME CHANGER.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.074
- FINAL DECISION.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.159
- BECAUSE I IMMEDIATELY

31:10.243 --> 31:11.911
RECOGNIZE WHAT I'M LOOKING AT,
I'M GOING WITH EMILY.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.746
- I'M GONNA GO WITH EMILY
AS WELL.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.622
- EMILY.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.082
- THANK YOU.

31:16.165 --> 31:18.376
- MARK AND DON.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.795
{\an8}- AS FAR AS HOW THEY MATCH UP
AS ONE WHOLE TATTOO,

31:20.878 --> 31:22.880
{\an8}I WISH THE CLOUDS MET UP
AT THAT THE TOP.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.799
{\an8}- BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF CLOUDS.

31:24.882 --> 31:26.801
{\an8}- WELL, THEY SHOULDN'T BE.
IT SHOULD BE THE SAME CLOUD.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.636
- THAT WAS ACTUALLY
A MISCOMMUNICATION.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.805
- I WENT A MORE JAPANESE STYLE
WITH IT,

31:30.888 --> 31:33.016
AND HE WENT
A MORE TRADITIONAL WAY.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.059
- IN TERMS OF ADAPTABILITY, I
THINK IRONING THAT KIND OF THING

31:35.143 --> 31:38.313
OUT WOULD'VE BEEN A KEY PART
OF THIS TEAM EFFORT.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.732
- GOING INTO DON'S TATTOO,
JUST OUTLINE ALONE,

31:40.815 --> 31:42.692
IT'S A LOT CLEANER THAN MARK'S.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.777
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR SHADING
IN THE HULL OF THE SHIP,

31:44.861 --> 31:46.779
IT'S NICE. IT'S SMOOTH.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.740
THERE'S A GOOD GRADUAL FADE
FROM BROWN TO LIGHT BROWN,

31:48.823 --> 31:50.700
YELLOW HIGHLIGHTS IN THERE.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.577
IT'S A STRONG LOOKING TATTOO.
- MARK.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.787
- IT'S VERY SCRATCHY.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.748
I KNOW YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S
A BEAT-UP, OLD, PIRATE SHIP,

31:56.831 --> 31:59.500
BUT IT'S STILL JUST TECHNICALLY
NOT REALLY THAT SMOOTH.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.544
- I'M THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF FENCE
WITH OLI.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.630
I LIKE THIS THING.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.840
I LIKE THE LITTLE HIDDEN
SKULL IN THE TORN-UP SAIL.

32:05.923 --> 32:08.217
THE CLOUDS, I REALLY
LIKED THE WAY YOU SHADED THEM.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.720
I THINK IT'S STRONG.
I LIKE THE LITTLE WISPY PURPLE

32:10.803 --> 32:12.430
THAT YOU PUT INTO THE SAILS.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.681
IT MIGHT NOT BE PERFECT,

32:13.765 --> 32:15.808
BUT IT'S TOUGH.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.268
- LET'S POLL THE JUDGES
FOR THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.312
- GOING WITH DON.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.397
- I'M STICKING WITH MARK.
I LIKE THE TOUGH ONE.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.815
- FOR JUST OVERALL READABILITY,
I'M GOING WITH DON.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.068
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

32:25.151 --> 32:29.614
- CHRIS AND JASON.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.784
HOW DID YOU GUYS COLLECTIVELY
LAND ON THIS CONCEPT?

32:32.867 --> 32:35.370
{\an8}WE BOTH DECIDED WE WERE
GONNA DO JAPANESE DRAGONS.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.581
{\an8}- OVERALL, AS ONE PIECE,
OBVIOUSLY, YOU SEE THE RED FLAME

32:38.665 --> 32:40.792
THAT TRICKLES FROM ONE SIDE
TO THE NEXT.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.794
OTHER THAN THAT, THERE'S NOT
A WHOLE LOT OF INTERLOCKING.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.338
I THINK YOU TOTALLY MISSED
WORKING TOGETHER ON THE BOTTOM,

32:45.421 --> 32:46.798
ON THE ENDING
OF THE TATTOO.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.758
YOU COULD'VE EASILY FOUND A WAY

32:48.841 --> 32:51.094
TO FLOW THOSE TWO THINGS
TOGETHER WITH LOOSE SHAPES.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.303
- CHRIS.
- I LOOK AT THIS DRAGON.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.180
IT'S VERY LEGIBLE.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.349
I CAN FOLLOW THE TWIST
OF THIS DRAGON AROUND.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.810
LEAVING THE FACE KIND OF
PROTRUDING OUT TOWARDS THE FRONT

32:58.893 --> 33:00.603
MAKES IT MORE READABLE
FROM A DISTANCE.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.148
- JASON, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
PICKING UP THIS GUY'S LOWER JAW.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.275
- IT'S FORWARD.
IT'S PROTRUDING.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.819
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING
COMING OFF OF THE BOTTOM JAW.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.737
- I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

33:09.821 --> 33:11.698
BUT IT'S
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.700
HIS HEAD
IS COMING AT YOU MORE LIKE--

33:13.783 --> 33:15.868
- IT LOOKS WEIRD, MAN.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD MAN.

33:15.952 --> 33:16.828
- JAPANESE BEING YOUR SPECIALTY,
THIS SHOULD BE IRONCLAD.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.330
THIS SHOULD BE VERY LEGIBLE.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.581
THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD TO READ
AND HARD TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

33:20.665 --> 33:21.749
IS TROUBLING FOR ME.

33:21.833 --> 33:22.834
- FINAL ANSWER?

33:22.917 --> 33:23.876
- CHRIS.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.336
- I'M GOING WITH CHRIS.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.463
- I'M GOING WITH CHRIS.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.590
- CHRIS BEAT YOU OUT
ON THE FACE.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.300
YOU LOST THIS BATTLE TO SOMEBODY
THAT DOESN'T DO THIS.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.969
I'M PRETTY LET DOWN ON THIS ONE.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.852
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

33:40.935 --> 33:43.688
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.940
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:46.023 --> 33:46.774
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:50.611 --> 33:55.408
- SO, JOSH, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO SET UP YOUR TEAMMATE?

33:55.491 --> 33:56.868
- WHAT DOES THAT--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

33:56.951 --> 33:58.202
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.288
YOU SET HER UP WITH THIS [bleep]

34:00.371 --> 34:02.790
REALISM PORTRAIT BULL[bleep].

34:02.874 --> 34:05.668
YOU KNEW SHE WASN'T GONNA
BE ABLE TO GET IT TO YOUR LEVEL.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.628
IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT HE [bleep] YOU OVER.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.713
- YOU NEED TO SHUT
THE [bleep] UP, SERIOUSLY.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.380
- NO, I DON'T.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.341
- YOU DID A [bleep] TATTOO
TODAY.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.177
HER TATTOO WAS WAY
[bleep] BETTER THAN YOURS.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.762
- YOU MADE SURE
TO DO PORTRAIT REALISM--

34:15.844 --> 34:17.929
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
SOME CRAZY,

34:18.222 --> 34:19.389
[bleep] MANIPULATIVE BITCH
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY ELSE--

34:19.474 --> 34:21.225
- I'M MANIPULATIVE?

34:21.309 --> 34:22.976
DUDE, YOU'VE BEEN
MANIPULATING PEOPLE

34:23.060 --> 34:24.812
SINCE YOU WALKED
THROUGH THIS DOOR.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.813
IT WAS YOUR [bleep] GOAL
TO MAKE SURE

34:26.898 --> 34:27.982
THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE
[bleep] COMPARED TO YOU.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.984
- YOU TATTOOED WELL.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.027
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE
FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.321
YOU GOT THIS.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.947
- WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD HER IF YOU
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT GREAT?

34:35.031 --> 34:36.783
- I--WELL,
I'M NOT GONNA--

34:36.866 --> 34:38.784
- LIKE HONESTLY, WOULD YOU
HAVE--

34:38.868 --> 34:40.661
- FOR ME TO SIT DOWN
AND PICK APART THE THINGS

34:40.745 --> 34:41.954
THAT ARE WRONG WITH IT
WHILE SHE'S DOING IT

34:42.038 --> 34:43.998
ISN'T GONNA HELP HER.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.373
FOR ME TO BE LIKE, "WELL,
YOU ALREADY DID THAT TOO DARK,"

34:45.458 --> 34:47.460
OR "THIS IS NOT QUITE RIGHT."

34:47.543 --> 34:49.378
WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT IT AT THAT POINT?

34:49.462 --> 34:50.588
- I'M LIKE--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK NOW.

34:50.670 --> 34:52.799
IF YOU DID SEE IT,

34:52.882 --> 34:54.675
I WISH YOU'D JUST TOLD ME
'CAUSE THEN I COULD'VE FIXED IT.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.594
- IT'S JUST NOT, LIKE,
AN APPROPRIATE PLACE

34:56.677 --> 34:58.763
FOR ME TO START
TEACHING YOU HOW TO TATTOO.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.723
YOU KNOW, AT THAT POINT,
NOW I HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT,

35:00.807 --> 35:02.016
IN YOUR TATTOO,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG, AND,

35:02.099 --> 35:03.392
YOU KNOW, TO REALLY ASSIST YOU,

35:03.476 --> 35:04.852
AND I DON'T--I WAS DOING MY OWN.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.771
- HE [bleep] YOU OVER, JULIA.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.940
- THAT'S REALISTIC.
- HE MANIPULATED YOU.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.858
- ANYBODY THAT SAYS PEOPLE
ARE MANIPULATING EACH OTHER

35:10.942 --> 35:12.985
[bleep] TRYING TO DO
THIS STUPID GAME PLAY

35:13.069 --> 35:14.779
OR SOME WEIRD [bleep] GET ALL
[bleep] UP IN THEIR OWN HEAD,

35:14.862 --> 35:16.197
AND THEY HAVE NO [bleep] IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.448
- WHATEVER, JOSH.

35:17.990 --> 35:24.455
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO WIN,

35:24.539 --> 35:26.332
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY,
WE'RE TESTING ADAPTABILITY

35:26.415 --> 35:28.668
WITH INTERLOCKING TATTOOS.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.337
JULIA MADE SOME STRANGE CHOICES
ON THIS PIECE.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.006
- WHEN YOU PUT THAT CRAZY
GRAY DIVOT IN THE CENTER

35:34.090 --> 35:35.883
OF THE RIDGE OF THE NOSE,

35:35.967 --> 35:37.969
YOU'RE JUST POINTING OUT
THAT THERE'S A HOLE THERE.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.679
- THIS MIGHT BE AN EXAMPLE OF
SOME OF THE POOREST ADAPTABILITY

35:39.762 --> 35:41.806
WE'VE SEEN ALL DAY.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.808
LET'S TALK ABOUT AARON'S TATTOO.

35:43.891 --> 35:46.102
IT'S JUST BAD DESIGN
AND BAD FOLLOW THROUGH.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.770
IT'S VERY CUT-AND-PASTE
AND COLLAGE-Y.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.980
THAT'S POOR ARTISTRY

35:49.063 --> 35:50.481
OUT OF THE GATE.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.733
- JASON.

35:52.817 --> 35:56.028
- IT REALLY DOES AMAZE ME THAT
JASON'S PROPORTIONS ARE SO OFF.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.948
WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S JUST A SPAGHETTI MESS.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.700
- I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHICH WAY

36:00.783 --> 36:02.660
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS GONNA VOTE.

36:02.743 --> 36:02.952
I'M REALLY INTERESTED
TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK.

36:04.912 --> 36:07.748
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:07.832 --> 36:08.916
- THIS IS MY TATTOO,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.793
AND JULIA WAS MY ARTIST.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.087
- THE TOP OF HER HEAD LOOKS
LIKE IT'S SKEWED A LITTLE BIT.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.839
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOT
A CONE HEAD.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.966
- I DON'T LIKE HOW THE HAIR
COMES OUT OF THE HOOD.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.010
- IT'S NOT VERY NATURAL.

36:19.093 --> 36:22.346
- THE NOSE AND THE EYES LOOK
LIKE THE RIGHT SIDE IS DOWN.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.932
IT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE SHE HAD A STROKE.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.602
- THIS IS MY TATTOO,
AND IT WAS DONE BY JASON.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.437
- YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.522
IT SERIOUSLY TOOK ME
FIVE MINUTES

36:31.606 --> 36:34.901
STARING AT THIS TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE THE HEAD WAS.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.028
- I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH
DETAIL GOING INTO THE SCALES.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.280
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THAT FACE.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.948
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT A TUMOR
ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD

36:41.032 --> 36:43.951
OR SOMETHING.
IT'S WEIRD.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.995
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.706
MY ARTIST WAS AARON.
I'M HAPPY WITH IT.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.875
- AT THE TOP OF THE MIRROR,
THE THREE CIRCLES,

36:50.958 --> 36:52.710
THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS LOWER
THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.712
- I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THE MIRROR.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.839
THE PEACOCK FEATHERS
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.257
THEY COULD'VE DEFINITELY
PUT MORE LINE WORK IN THERE.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.009
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

37:00.092 --> 37:00.927
ARE WE ALL AGREED?
- YES.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.554
- YES.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.014
- JASON,
YOU GOT A REALLY HARSH CRITIQUE.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.058
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING DOWN?

37:07.141 --> 37:09.101
- I THINK THE JUDGES
WILL CALL ME DOWN FOR THAT.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.020
- I MEAN, OUT OF ALL
OF THE TATTOOS THAT WERE DONE,

37:11.103 --> 37:12.021
IT'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT YOU JUST CANNOT SEE

37:12.271 --> 37:13.522
WHAT THE [bleep] IT IS AT ALL.

37:13.606 --> 37:14.523
- YEAH, THANK YOU, JOSH.

37:17.193 --> 37:20.196
- HERE WE GO.

37:20.279 --> 37:23.449
- ALL RIGHT, THE JUDGES
WANT TO SEE...

37:23.532 --> 37:25.284
JULIA,

37:25.368 --> 37:28.788
AARON,

37:28.871 --> 37:31.457
AND JASON.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.458
WE'LL SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.713
- YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING HOME?
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.006
I MEAN, THE JUDGES
CAN DO ANYTHING.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.800
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

37:40.883 --> 37:40.925
I JUST WANT TO GO
GET IT OVER WITH.

37:52.853 --> 37:56.691
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO CREATE
INTERLOCKING TATTOOS IN TEAMS.

37:56.774 --> 38:00.820
JASON, JULIA, AND AARON,

38:00.903 --> 38:04.115
ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD BE JUSTIFIABLY SENT HOME.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.785
- JASON, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:07.868 --> 38:11.080
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.416
- I JUST HAD AN OFF MOMENT.

38:13.499 --> 38:17.420
I WAS DEALING WITH ANXIETIES
PUSHING THEMSELVES ON ME.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.255
- WE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR TATTOO,

38:19.338 --> 38:21.257
THE FACT THAT IT WAS HARD
TO READ.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.217
SOMETHING THAT'S CONFUSING
AND HARD TO READ TO US

38:23.300 --> 38:24.677
IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE HARD
TO READ TO THEM.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.137
- I JUST DID A HORRIBLE DESIGN.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.138
I'M TRYING TO PUT IT BEHIND ME.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.848
I'M HERE TO BE THE INK MASTER.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.599
- THIS BEING YOUR SPECIALTY,

38:30.683 --> 38:32.893
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
THOSE PROBLEMS.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.478
- AARON.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.480
- THIS LOOKS VERY REMEDIAL.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.982
- I'M NOT SUPER PROUD OF IT.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.151
I WASN'T
INTO THE SUBJECT MATTER,

38:40.234 --> 38:42.069
WHICH SHOULDN'T PLAY A PART,
BUT IT DID.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.904
- THAT'S WHERE THEN
I HAVE ISSUE.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.239
IT IS NOT FAIR TO BE
CALLED INK MASTER

38:45.322 --> 38:47.116
IF YOU CANNOT DRAW

38:47.366 --> 38:49.160
A DESIGN PLEASING ENOUGH
TO YOURSELF TO THEN TATTOO.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.079
- JULIA.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.165
- TODAY YOU FELL SHORT.

38:54.248 --> 38:57.251
THE SHADING IN THE FACE,
THE CROOKED EYE, THE HAIR.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.420
- THIS IS NOT THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.505
I FEEL LIKE AARON'S WAS DONE
MORE POORLY THAN MINE.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.218
- YOU SEE THE BRIDGE
OF THAT NOSE, RIGHT?

39:06.302 --> 39:08.137
THAT FACE IS [bleep].

39:08.387 --> 39:09.930
- DID I SAY IT'S THE BEST
PORTRAIT I'VE EVER DONE?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.640
NO.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.642
I WISH I'D PUT MORE DETAIL
INTO--

39:13.726 --> 39:15.019
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE GENTLEMAN

39:15.102 --> 39:16.854
WAS SAYING AT THIS MOMENT.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.981
- AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE
WHAT MY TATTOO IS.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.192
- YOU, ON YOUR BEST DAY,
CANNOT TOUCH MY WORST WORK.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.569
- YOU HAVE A BIG BLACK BLOB
ON SOMEONE'S ARM.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.696
- I SWEAR TO YOU
IF I GO HOME BEFORE THESE TWO,

39:25.780 --> 39:28.449
I WILL [bleep] QUIT TATTOOING.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.367
- I TATTOOED MY LEG
FOR SIX FREAKING HOURS

39:30.451 --> 39:31.994
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE HERE
AND--

39:32.078 --> 39:33.788
- STOP.
JUST STOP.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.748
THAT'S ONE THING
TO DEFEND YOUR WORK.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.541
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO FIGHT A LOSING BATTLE,

39:37.625 --> 39:40.252
AND YOU ARE FIGHTING
A LOSING BATTLE.

39:40.336 --> 39:45.382
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...

39:45.466 --> 39:47.176
JULIA,

39:47.426 --> 39:50.846
YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.723
- ALL THE JUDGES AGREE,

39:52.807 --> 39:54.975
YOU DO HAVE THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.228
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING HOME,
FLAT OUT.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.854
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES,

39:58.938 --> 40:00.272
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.366
- THE JUDGES' DECISION
WAS COMPLETE BULL[bleep].

40:10.449 --> 40:12.952
I DID NOT HAVE THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.245
AARON DID A WORSE TATTOO
THAN ME,

40:14.328 --> 40:16.580
AND I'M THE ONE GOING HOME.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.332
I STILL HAVE MORE TO PROVE.

40:18.582 --> 40:19.416
THIS ISN'T THE LAST
YOU'VE HEARD FROM ME.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.965
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:26.048 --> 40:27.299
- THE SMELL OF BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE MONEY TO ME.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.346
- I DO BETTER TATTOOS
THAN YOU AND YOU'RE THREATENED.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.557
- I'M HERE TO [bleep] COMPETE.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.559
- WELL,
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START?

40:36.642 --> 40:38.644
- YOU'RE A SELF-ABSORBED PRICK
OF AN ASS[bleep].

40:38.727 --> 40:40.813
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TATTOO
EVER AGAIN.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.606
- DUDE, YOU SHOULD--
- YOU'RE DONE.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.400
- OVERALL,
IT'S JUST NOT ATTRACTIVE.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.318
- THE FACE, MAN.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

40:46.402 --> 40:47.695
- THERE'S NO EXCUSES.
I'M EMBARRASSED.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.655
- YOU REALLY MISSED THE MARK.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.823
- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
AN AUTOPSY HAPPENING.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.658
- I BELONG HERE.

40:52.741 --> 40:53.993
- EITHER SHOW US THAT YOU
CAN DO BETTER,

40:54.076 --> 40:54.326
OR IT'S LIGHTS OUT, BUD.
