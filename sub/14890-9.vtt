Jennifer is gonna
love her engagement ring.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.350
And I was smart enough to buy it
from a discount jeweler

01:24.384 --> 01:26.720
so I got twice the ring
at half the price.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.222
Well, cousin, Jennifer’s
gonna need twice the finger

So, so, so, what you’re saying
is the right way

07:50.537 --> 07:54.040
to right the wrong is to give
Jennifer back the right ring

to take off her ring

08:43.924 --> 08:44.958
then I’ll distract the girls.

08:44.991 --> 08:45.959
When I do,
you switch the real ring

08:45.992 --> 08:47.761
for the fake ring
and give me the okay sign.

you might be able to

heirlooms when we’re married.

just go upstairs

of Moolinki loaf.

Bye‐bye. Bye‐bye.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.313
Yes! Balki, we pulled it off.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.282
Now, Jennifer’s wearing
a genuine diamond

hunk of glass in the garbage.

tell the difference between

and this fake diamond.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.159
Well, Balki,
I can understand your confusion.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.895
Of course,
to my trained eye it’s obvious

13:14.928 --> 13:17.531
this is not a real diamond.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.900
But to the average person
like yourself, Balki

13:19.933 --> 13:22.102
there is only one way to tell.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.906
A diamond is the hardest
substance in nature.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.107
It can cut glass.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.410
[squeaking]

13:30.443 --> 13:32.579
See? Nothing.

13:32.613 --> 13:34.347
Now if this were a real diamond

13:34.380 --> 13:37.050
there would be a hole
right here.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.619
[glass shatters]

13:38.652 --> 13:41.387
[instrumental music]

13:52.065 --> 13:53.499
What did you do?

13:53.534 --> 13:56.069
What do you mean, what I did do?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.337
I was just standing here.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.105
You were the one
who cut the glass.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.342
No, not the window. The ring.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.911
What did you do with the ring?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.648
I switched it
like you told me to.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.616
‐You switched it?
‐Like you told me to.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.353
Well, then why did you
go like this?

14:13.386 --> 14:16.623
Because this means
everything’s okay.

14:16.657 --> 14:19.092
No, this means
everything is okay!

14:20.260 --> 14:21.628
No, cousin, this means

14:21.662 --> 14:23.396
the lead sheep
has been neutered.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.370
Oh, my Lord.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.641
Oh, oh, no. Oh, no.

14:34.675 --> 14:36.943
That means that Jennifer
still has the fake ring

14:36.977 --> 14:38.512
and she’s gonna get it appraised
first thing in the morning.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.380
Alright, Balki,
we are going to go upstairs

14:40.413 --> 14:41.948
to the girls’ apartment tonight
while they’re sleeping

14:41.982 --> 14:42.983
and get that ring back!

14:44.484 --> 14:46.219
‐Where are we going?
‐We gotta get some flashlights.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.526
[instrumental music]

15:08.041 --> 15:09.342
[screams]

15:09.375 --> 15:11.377
[shushing]

15:13.179 --> 15:15.148
Just open the window.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.135
Balki, my eyes!

15:45.445 --> 15:46.446
Come on.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.451
Cousin? C...

16:01.361 --> 16:03.429
I’ve dreamed of being
in Jennifer’s bedroom.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.401
I just never thought
I’d have to break in.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.709
Here, hold the ring for me.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.419
Mmm.

16:31.692 --> 16:32.693
[mouthing words]

17:05.391 --> 17:07.492
Mm‐mmm.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.431
[mouthing words]

17:39.726 --> 17:40.727
Ah!

17:58.178 --> 17:59.179
[mouthing words]

18:03.283 --> 18:04.785
[mouthing words]

18:19.633 --> 18:20.634
[grunts]

18:27.508 --> 18:28.709
[mouthing words]

18:38.251 --> 18:39.252
[mouthing words]

18:50.396 --> 18:51.665
[mouthing words]

19:10.751 --> 19:11.752
[mouthing words]

19:23.496 --> 19:24.497
Oh.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.581
(Jennifer)
Hmm.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.788
[mouthing words]

20:01.467 --> 20:02.468
[mouthing words]

20:11.878 --> 20:12.879
Ow!

20:18.451 --> 20:19.686
Mary Anne, what was that?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.788
I can’t see! Oh, God, I’m blind!

20:25.391 --> 20:26.793
Take off the mask.

20:26.827 --> 20:28.762
We go through this
every morning!

20:32.666 --> 20:33.600
My God, my ring is gone!

20:35.468 --> 20:37.003
The window’s open.
We’ve been robbed!

20:37.971 --> 20:40.574
[screams]

20:41.575 --> 20:42.709
Would you be quiet?

20:42.743 --> 20:44.444
They may still be here.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.478
Now, come on, let’s check.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.380
[whispers]

20:47.948 --> 20:49.616
Okay. Here.

20:54.855 --> 20:55.922
I want the pink one.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.796
‐Let’s check.
‐Okay.

21:07.568 --> 21:08.802
(Larry)
Come on!

21:08.835 --> 21:11.772
[grunting]

21:19.479 --> 21:21.548
Hello.

21:21.582 --> 21:23.684
Put down the doll
and let’s get outta here!

21:23.717 --> 21:25.652
‐I‐‐
‐Come on.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.733
Larry! Balki!
What are you doing?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.604
We heard Mary Anne scream
and we came right up.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.871
Is everything okay?

21:55.982 --> 21:58.552
It’s taken me a few tries

21:58.585 --> 22:01.054
but this is the engagement ring
you can keep.

22:02.623 --> 22:03.924
It’s smaller than the others‐‐

22:03.957 --> 22:06.492
Oh, Larry, I love this ring.

22:06.527 --> 22:08.995
The other diamond was too big.
It wasn’t my style.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.998
Well, I’m glad you like it.

22:12.032 --> 22:13.800
And I’m glad
you could buy your car back.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.372
Cousin Larry
got a really great deal.

22:19.405 --> 22:20.741
He was able to buy it back

22:20.774 --> 22:22.943
for only $200 more
than he sold it for.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.714
Boy, Larry,
doing things the hard way

22:27.748 --> 22:29.883
sure comes easy to you.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.652
Well, I meant well.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.821
I‐I just wanted you
to have the best.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.758
I have the best. I have you.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.732
[theme music]

23:12.826 --> 23:14.661
[music continues]
