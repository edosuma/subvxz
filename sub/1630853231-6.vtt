00:48.882 --> 00:51.718
Man, I love it up here.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.595
You been camping?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.013
Look at me, Detective.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.099
I look like I want to sleep
on the fucking ground?

00:58.475 --> 01:01.603
Well, my dad used to take us every summer.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.024
He once left me alone
for 24 hours. Didn't say anything.

01:06.108 --> 01:09.695
Just walked off one day
to see if I had the survival skills.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.572
Must be why you're so well-adjusted.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.991
Just saying, I'll take you if you want.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.327
I'm not going camping with you, Durst.
Spend enough time with you as it is.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.800
I like the bunny ears. Kinky.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.428
Take notes.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.014
Looks like she was dragged.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.018
Sharp force trauma to the neck.
It looks deep.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.771
No blood pool.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.149
No. She was cleaned up.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.651
Somebody wanted it to look pretty?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.488
Certainly came prepared.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.033
Yep. Knew what he was doing.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.118
Or she.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.510
She didn't put up a fight.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.854
Hey…

02:25.938 --> 02:30.067
Hey, can you guys hear me? Hello--

02:31.443 --> 02:33.195
Okay, none of this makes any sense.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.657
I was camping, and then…

02:37.866 --> 02:39.201
I don't know what happened.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.828
-I was fine and then--
-A weird sex thing gone wrong?

02:43.539 --> 02:45.541
Hey, can somebody please cover me up?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.042
It's a weird outfit for camping.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.545
Yeah, I don't think she was camping.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.296
That's not what I was wearing.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.841
-Stripper, maybe?
-I'm not a stripper.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.176
-Dragged out here.
-I'm not…

02:56.885 --> 02:58.762
-There were the assaults…
-I need--

02:58.846 --> 03:00.264
…at Juicy Lucy's last month.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.515
What is happening?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.767
Did you get these numbers in her arm?

03:03.851 --> 03:04.935
-What numbers?
-What numbers?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.187
There are numbers carved into her arm.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.440
-551143.
-God, fuck. Five, five--

03:10.524 --> 03:13.151
It's not enough digits for a phone number.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.195
Could be a Bible reference?

03:15.279 --> 03:17.281
Oh, my God. You and the Jesus thing.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.492
Fuck you.
The Bible reference, it's an idea.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.452
Oh, my God.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.456
Who would do this? This is…

03:28.542 --> 03:30.460
Why am I still here? That's--

03:33.088 --> 03:36.175
It's like I'm having the worst period
of my life. Oh, fuck.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.678
Jesus Christ. What limp dick is running
this shit show?

03:39.761 --> 03:40.804
Hi.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.765
Carole Andrews
from the county sheriff's office.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.350
Thanks so much for coming up.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.810
-Hi, I'm Detective Chris Durst.
-Hi.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.979
This is my partner,
Detective Bobby Bronson.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.774
-You the one who found the body?
-No. Well, kind of.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.277
A hiker found her, and I got the call,

03:55.360 --> 03:59.156
so technically I didn't find her,
but I did radio for assistance

03:59.239 --> 04:01.617
since we don't have the manpower
for this kinda thing.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.701
It's my first murder.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.578
I can walk you through
what I found so far--

04:04.661 --> 04:05.787
Where'd you get that coffee?

04:06.622 --> 04:09.499
-This?
-Yeah, the one in your hand.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.294
There's a little general store
right up the road.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.713
How about this? Grab us a coffee.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.964
While you're at it,
get this area roped off properly.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.716
I want a 20-foot perimeter
around the body,

04:18.800 --> 04:19.885
another ten feet after that.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.553
Get these fucking squad cars out of here,

04:21.637 --> 04:24.348
'cause they're probably destroying
a whole bunch of fucking evidence.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.725
Almond milk, two sugars.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.603
You got it, Detective.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.154
Oh, my God.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.457
It's annoying
that you're actually kind of attractive.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.421
Okay, maybe I'm still here
because I have unfinished business,

04:56.505 --> 04:59.091
like in that movie Ghost
with Patrick Swayze.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.425
Wait, he talks to people, right?

05:00.509 --> 05:03.804
How's he do it?
He, like, finds Whoopi Goldberg.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.764
Okay, I need my Whoopi Goldberg.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.225
Hello?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
Is anyone here my Whoopi Goldberg?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.065
Hey. You seem distracted today.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.192
Yeah, he's traumatized. I'm traumatized.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.902
It's my wife's birthday.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.488
-Well, ex-wife.
-That doesn't seem relevant.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.198
-You gonna call her?
-Nah.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.201
-It's complicated.
-Kind of in the middle of something.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.452
You don't have to run, Carole.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.705
Waited this long for caffeine.
What's a few more minutes?

05:29.788 --> 05:30.914
Patrol just dropped this off.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.168
They were sitting on a car
about half a mile away registered to a…

05:34.251 --> 05:36.086
-Rebecca Moss.
-…Rebecca Moss.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.004
That's me.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.964
Wow, that's her.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.799
Can we take a minute
to acknowledge the real tragedy?

05:40.883 --> 05:42.176
I was clearly in my prime.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.595
-You think ID'ing a dead girl is funny?
-No.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.846
No.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.016
It's just, who gets a blowout
and contours their face

05:49.099 --> 05:50.642
before a trip to the DMV?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.311
-Wow.
-Contour.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.271
You live with your license photo
a long time, Carole.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.356
-Unless you die.
-Okay, okay.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.441
Hey.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.902
You know how women like
to go to the bathroom together?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.863
You're gonna stay with the body.
Girl time.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.407
Take good care of my body, Carole.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.994
And contouring takes like two minutes.
I'd show you, but, you know, I'm dead.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.749
God.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.303
Okay. Where are we headed?

06:35.312 --> 06:36.605
This place is a dump.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.190
Yeah, but it was my dump.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.526
God, I'm gonna miss it.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.864
Been meaning to finish this bookshelf
for over a year.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.118
Thought if I went back and got my degree,
I'd have books to actually put on it.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.080
I guess that's not happening now either.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.044
-Got a lot of true crime here.
-Chicks love that shit.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.005
Can you not talk like that?
It's disrespectful.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.467
Okay, Mister "I love my mom
and my wife and my daughters."

07:05.968 --> 07:07.594
You say that like it's a weakness.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.389
I just think if someone's
kissing you goodbye in the morning,

07:10.472 --> 07:12.599
telling you to go out
and make the world a better place,

07:12.683 --> 07:13.892
you're living a fantasy.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.311
Better than being a jaded asshole

07:16.395 --> 07:19.690
who has to numb himself on a daily basis
just to do his job.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.400
You calling me an asshole?

07:21.483 --> 07:24.820
Hey. Just using my powers of observation.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.198
This is such bullshit.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.243
I had a life. I had friends.

07:31.326 --> 07:35.080
What, now I'm just going to have PMS
for all eternity?

07:35.664 --> 07:36.790
What the fuck?

07:38.667 --> 07:40.919
Keep your hand out of my head, okay?

07:41.003 --> 07:42.004
Bingo.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.756
Looks like she was hiding her stash
from someone.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.718
Yeah, don't be such a judgmental narc.
It's weed, not heroin.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.052
Don't-- Fuck.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.639
What? Helps me focus.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.308
Puts me in touch with the cosmos.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.642
It makes you grumpy,

07:55.726 --> 07:57.811
and then I gotta be the one
to lie to forensics.

07:57.895 --> 07:58.937
So don't look.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.024
All right. I guess I'm gonna go
into the bedroom again to do my job.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.988
God, that smells good.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.743
Come on, Detective.

08:13.785 --> 08:18.832
You can't even feel my presence?
Even just a little bit?

08:21.668 --> 08:22.711
How about this?

08:30.844 --> 08:31.887
Can't even flirt.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.849
This is the worst.
This is my literal hell.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.352
-Laptop.
-I never use that.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.563
Actually, you know what, what's your take?

08:41.647 --> 08:43.482
I mean, what's the weed telling you?

08:43.565 --> 08:45.484
Yeah, Bronson. We're all curious.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.364
Girl's a knockout, obviously.

08:50.948 --> 08:51.949
Finally, a fact.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.284
But, beyond looks,

08:54.368 --> 08:56.328
she hasn't got much else going on.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.747
No close relationships,
no family photos anywhere.

08:58.830 --> 09:02.042
So she's probably a waitress
or a bartender somewhere.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.087
Nice try, Sherlock. I'm a phlebotomist.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.256
And I have a brother.
He lives in Wisconsin.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.093
No food. Just ice cream and wine, so…

09:12.845 --> 09:15.389
I'm thinking she's bulimic.
Or an alcoholic.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.473
Maybe both.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.892
You ever met a girl going through
a breakup before?

09:18.976 --> 09:20.310
She's out there camping.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.312
Trying to clean herself up.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.232
Having one of those
Eat Pray Love weekends.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.570
Then this psycho thru-hiker
comes out of the woods,

09:29.653 --> 09:31.405
sees a hot girl,

09:31.488 --> 09:32.948
probably tries to hit on her.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.743
When she says "no", he goes Gothic on her.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.914
Knocks her out, slits her throat,
strips her down to her underwear

09:40.998 --> 09:42.082
and…

09:42.958 --> 09:45.419
carves some random numbers into her

09:45.502 --> 09:48.422
to make it look like
some kind of ritual thing.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.509
Or she's a prostitute.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.011
Okay, I'm not a prostitute.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.097
I'm just a broke, slightly depressed girl
who recently got dumped.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.350
What happened to Mister
"I respect all women. I love my mom"?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.769
-Oh, my God. Todd.
-Hey, prostitutes are some of

10:02.853 --> 10:04.688
the most vulnerable women in our society.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.899
It's fucking Todd.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.902
We were together three years.
We broke up two weeks ago.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.361
Hey, freebie.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.071
-Fucking Todd.
-The password right here.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.740
I will kill him if he killed me.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.868
He was obsessed
with that frigging reality show

10:17.951 --> 10:19.536
about knives on the History Channel.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.747
You know,
it's like blacksmiths making weapons

10:21.830 --> 10:23.290
and chopping shit up with them.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.043
-It's basically school for murderers.
-Wow. Wow.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.378
Maybe a bear did it?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.088
Hey.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.299
Lot of emails
from someone named Christina.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.436
-Take your time.
-Sorry.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.984
Aren't you guys supposed to be wearing,
like, trench coats or something?

10:51.068 --> 10:53.278
Don't believe
everything you see on TV, kid.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.782
Well, I hope you solve this thing soon.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.910
My sister's a mess.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.204
I'm supposed to be
the one babysitting him.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.539
Not the other way around.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.415
He seems a little old for babysitting.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.167
Yeah, tell that to our parents.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.419
Do you need anything?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.171
No, I'm fine.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.346
It's my fault.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.809
-It was my idea for her to go camping.
-Honey, no.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.187
It is not your fault.
You were just trying to be a good friend.

11:27.271 --> 11:32.860
She wanted to just smoke weed
and watch all 11 seasons of The X-Files.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.530
But I was like,
"What about getting some fresh air?"

11:37.114 --> 11:39.032
She didn't even know
how to work a camping stove.

11:39.116 --> 11:42.244
Tell them about Todd. Todd. Todd.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.621
Sorry, this is unreal.

11:45.831 --> 11:49.001
Stop. You're gonna make me cry.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.964
Motherfucking cramps!

11:54.047 --> 11:57.926
If I am a ghost,
why am I still getting cramps?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.013
-Holy shit.
-What was that?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.472
Did I do that?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.850
-Fuck, fuck, fuck.
-You tell us. It's your house.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.226
Fuck.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.603
Shit, shit, shit.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.438
-We went to her apartment.
-Ass!

12:10.272 --> 12:11.273
Not much there…

12:11.940 --> 12:13.233
We looked at her Instagram.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.402
You were her only girlfriend?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.487
That's not true.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.364
I had lots of friends. Tell 'em, lights.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.449
Flicker.

12:20.532 --> 12:24.036
I think most girls were probably
jealous of her.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.954
-How so?
-No, were they?

12:26.038 --> 12:28.373
Well, there was always some guy

12:28.457 --> 12:30.542
kind of waiting in the wings, you know?

12:30.626 --> 12:33.712
She was never single
for more than, like, 48 hours.

12:33.795 --> 12:34.922
And…

12:36.131 --> 12:38.509
Like, guys always wanted to help her.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.845
Or she knew how to get things

12:41.929 --> 12:42.930
if she needed them.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.264
So she was manipulative.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.933
-She didn't say that.
-No.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.352
I think I'm describing her wrong.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.480
You said that most girls were jealous
of her. What about you?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.815
No. I--

12:53.899 --> 12:56.610
-Okay. This is your next big hunch?
-It wasn't like that.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.654
-My best friend killed me? Brilliant.
-I'd never--

12:58.737 --> 13:01.740
Just trying to get a sense of who she was,
see if we can shake anything loose.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.325
Okay.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.538
Well, she was trying to go back to school.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.331
If that helps.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.167
She'd dropped out of college,

13:12.251 --> 13:14.253
and I know she really wanted
to get her degree.

13:14.336 --> 13:18.966
But, well, sometimes she had trouble
following through with things.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.135
And, like, sometimes at dinner,

13:22.219 --> 13:26.265
she would go on and on
about all the chaos in her life

13:26.348 --> 13:30.143
and, like, stuff with her
and relationships.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.105
But then I would get home and realize

13:33.188 --> 13:36.191
that she hadn't really asked me
anything about my life.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.611
I loved her anyway.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.198
Even if she wasn't always
the greatest friend, you know?

13:43.949 --> 13:45.117
Oh, my God.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.911
This is, like,
worse than A Christmas Carol.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.079
Oh, fuck.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.624
I'm never going to celebrate
Christmas again. Goddamn it.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.505
Do you need to call an electrician?

13:59.298 --> 14:00.883
Maybe that was Becky.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.719
Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I'm so sorry.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.846
Is there anybody else
that we should talk to?

14:05.929 --> 14:08.515
Todd, Todd, Todd.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.476
Have you spoken to Todd yet?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.853
-Yes!
-Who's Todd?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.813
-Her ex.
-Finally. Thank God!

14:14.897 --> 14:16.148
He manages a bar

14:16.231 --> 14:17.858
about ten minutes from here.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.026
A bar. Okay.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.988
Where are you, you fucking coward?
I know you're here.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.365
Murderer!

14:25.449 --> 14:29.244
How could you do this to me?
How could you be so fucking selfish?

14:29.745 --> 14:30.829
See these fucking guys?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.957
There are two guys coming for you.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.959
You Todd? Todd Holt?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.378
Yeah, why?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.172
-You know why, fucking asshole.
-You know Rebecca Moss?

14:40.881 --> 14:41.840
Tell 'em.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.926
Do I?

14:44.009 --> 14:46.678
What she do now? Did she get arrested?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.055
Why would I get arrested?

14:48.138 --> 14:51.183
-What makes you think she'd be arrested?
-Public indecency.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.519
Last I saw her,
she was dancing on the bar drunk,

14:53.602 --> 14:56.480
trying to take off all her clothes
to piss me off.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.816
I don't think she's going to be
taking off any clothes anytime soon.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.155
-What's going on? Something happen to her?
-Don't play dumb. They're detectives.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.241
They're gonna find your fingerprints
and semen everywhere.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.951
-She was found dead.
-It's over, Todd.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.494
About 25 miles from here.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.287
-No way.
-I texted you that photo.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.748
-You knew exactly where I was.
-She's not dead.

15:14.831 --> 15:18.627
-Oh, my-- You fucking used that--
-Yeah. She is, Todd.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.671
-geolocation thing…
-That's why we're here.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.339
…or the fucking app you used to stalk me.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.925
-'Cause you're a jealous stalker asshole.
-She sent me a text last night.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.426
-No shit.
-Can we see it?

15:26.510 --> 15:27.803
Sure.

15:29.555 --> 15:30.556
See?

15:31.390 --> 15:33.684
It's her middle finger
in front of a sunset.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.768
That's right.

15:34.852 --> 15:38.772
To which you responded,
"skull emoji, skull emoji, skull emoji."

15:38.856 --> 15:39.940
Stupid asshole.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.775
Then you called her a bitch.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.278
I was pissed. Doesn't mean I killed her.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.445
Doesn't mean you didn't.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.781
-Why'd you break up?
-None of your business.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.908
Want us to get a subpoena,
turn your life inside out?

15:49.992 --> 15:50.993
Tell 'em.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.664
I cheated on her. Okay?

15:56.206 --> 15:58.041
-But I thought she was cheating on me…
-Fucking said it.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.919
…because she was always flirting with
my friends, random guys at trivia night.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.421
Even my cousin.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.464
-Are you kidding me?
-Where were you last night?

16:04.548 --> 16:05.591
Your cousin grabbed my ass.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.177
I spent the night at my girlfriend's.
Janine. Check my Instagram.

16:09.928 --> 16:10.929
Last night?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.767
She's 18, just before you say anything.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.060
She just looks young.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.981
We made lasagna. Had lots of sex.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.317
Her roommate can vouch for that part.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.236
Well, the lasagna part checks out.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.365
Look man, it wasn't me.
Right? You know how girls get.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.202
They're fucking crazy.
People cheat all the time.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.579
The fuck?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.041
All right, all right.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.084
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, my-- Holy shit.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.377
-I did it!
-Fuck!

16:42.461 --> 16:43.754
I did that. Oh, my God.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.007
-Well, that went well.
-Fuck that guy.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.717
God, that felt good.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.679
It was like all the anger in my body went
right into Todd.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.974
I gotta figure out how to do it again.
Like, can you make as angry as Todd did?

16:56.058 --> 16:58.435
-Hey, man, the guy's got an alibi.
-So?

16:58.519 --> 16:59.978
-I'm calling it. Gimme the keys.
-It's not working.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.064
-Fuck no.
-What? We're not stopping now.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.607
A girl is dead.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.400
I'm not gonna stop until I have a lead.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.402
-Thank you.
-You're not gonna find anything, man.

17:07.486 --> 17:10.656
You're just gonna obsess and obsess
and get even drunker when you get home.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.451
Better than going home to my wife,
pretending I'm some hero cop.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.911
Talking about how I spent all day

17:15.993 --> 17:18.329
on some righteous mission
to save all women.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.583
Jesus, again?

17:22.376 --> 17:23.919
Give me the keys. I'm serious.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.010
You guys really need to work
some shit out.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.096
You can walk back to the station.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.723
Jesus liked to walk, didn't he?

17:38.475 --> 17:39.768
I feel bad for you, man.

17:41.812 --> 17:42.813
Bye.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.191
Yeah, we don't need you!

17:50.988 --> 17:53.115
Although it is kinda weird
that it wasn't Todd.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.577
Like, I don't really have any other leads.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.635
Good, yeah.

18:35.741 --> 18:39.119
Can't believe Todd was the last guy
I ever had sex with.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.956
You never think about that
when you're fucking someone.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.001
Is this it? Is this the final dick?

18:49.671 --> 18:52.633
I liked sex.
I had a lot of it when I was alive.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.094
But I was always so focused
on whatever guy I was with,

18:56.178 --> 18:59.765
whatever fucking relationship I was in.

18:59.848 --> 19:03.060
Everything else took, like, a back seat.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.687
I was really trying to change that.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.898
That's why I went camping by myself.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.692
I didn't want to wait
for anyone to go with me.

19:10.776 --> 19:11.944
And it wasn't easy.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.196
I hate doing stuff by myself.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.657
But, you know,

19:17.824 --> 19:22.663
I was trying to, like,
get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.876
And I wasn't flirting with his cousin.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.588
I was just feeling insecure

19:31.672 --> 19:33.924
because it was a family party

19:34.007 --> 19:36.301
and I could tell
his mom didn't like me and…

19:43.767 --> 19:45.936
Are you the reason I'm still here?

19:48.647 --> 19:52.943
Am I supposed to, like, help you help me?

19:59.575 --> 20:00.576
Bronson.

20:03.579 --> 20:04.955
Can you see me?

20:15.507 --> 20:17.301
I don't think that woman murdered me.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.760
I've never seen her before.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.345
You're drunk.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.514
I'm not drunk. I'm working.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.808
This is why I got a restraining order.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.145
Wait, is this your ex?
Have we been stalking your ex-wife?

20:28.228 --> 20:29.771
Don't. You'll wake the kids.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.774
I can't stop thinking about you.
You know that.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.987
There was this girl. She was murdered.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.363
She looked just like you.

20:38.864 --> 20:41.700
That's what you were thinking about
when you were looking at my dead body?

20:41.783 --> 20:43.368
That I look like your ex-wife?

20:43.452 --> 20:46.205
All right, you need to go
before I call the cops.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.748
-I--
-I am the cops.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.417
That's it.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.795
I am done.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.965
I am so fucking done.

20:57.466 --> 21:02.095
I can't believe I sat here for hours,
waiting for him to do something.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.098
You can't come inside.

21:11.605 --> 21:14.775
I cannot die like this.

21:14.858 --> 21:18.654
Mutilated in a fucking forest
and forgotten about,

21:18.737 --> 21:24.243
while all these fucking men
are so far up their asses.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.832
Anybody there?

21:39.216 --> 21:40.551
That's fine.

21:40.634 --> 21:44.930
You can fucking use my death
to get back in her pants.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.559
I'm gonna solve this thing myself.

21:54.940 --> 21:55.983
Fuck yeah.

22:34.188 --> 22:36.481
There's another Prius. White Prius.

22:37.149 --> 22:38.609
Come on.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.944
-Motorcycle.
-See, that was cool.

22:41.445 --> 22:42.988
-What, the hog? Yeah.
-See that?

22:43.071 --> 22:46.533
Sixty. Seventy-seven, 83, 90.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.118
There you are.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.502
Oh, boy.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.215
Oh, God.

23:04.176 --> 23:06.428
He's, like, extra upset
by this investigation.

23:07.513 --> 23:09.348
I'm not upset by the investigation.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.350
A little scared.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.186
Shit.

23:14.978 --> 23:15.979
That's weird.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.068
Carole.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.239
Hey, that's the box
I'm looking for, actually.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.032
-It is? Okay.
-Yeah.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.325
-Fuck yeah.
-Here you go.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.161
Are we done with this shit?

23:31.245 --> 23:32.287
I don't know, man.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.498
What does it mean?
Why? It's clearly a costume.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.793
-What is this referencing?
-Right.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.753
Please find somewhere else
to get sandwiches.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.338
-I know.
-Whatever, man.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.048
-What the fuck, man?
-Fuck!

23:43.632 --> 23:47.010
This goddamn fucking desk.
It's the second time it's happened today.

23:47.094 --> 23:50.597
And this whip,
it doesn't go at all with the costume.

23:50.681 --> 23:51.765
Why not rope?

23:53.183 --> 23:54.685
Why a whip?

23:54.768 --> 23:57.020
Yes, Carole. We're mind-melding.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.188
We are mind-melding.

24:25.299 --> 24:26.383
Holy shit.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.022
Jesus.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.735
I loved you.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.488
I told you things I didn't tell anybody.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.574
I trusted you.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.409
Why would you want to hurt me?

24:52.492 --> 24:56.705
Were you jealous of my shitty dating life?

24:57.289 --> 24:59.708
Of my shitty apartment? Of my shitty job?

25:01.084 --> 25:04.087
In every book,
it's always somebody you know.

25:04.171 --> 25:06.632
But I didn't think it would be you.

25:08.509 --> 25:09.551
Shit.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.596
What happened?

25:14.848 --> 25:16.934
Nothing, okay. I'm just--

25:17.726 --> 25:19.770
I'm just drunk and I'm sad.

25:20.896 --> 25:25.067
Okay? The only person
who ever cared about me is dead,

25:25.150 --> 25:27.486
so just please go back
to your stupid game.

25:31.949 --> 25:33.825
I'm serious, Chad. Leave me alone.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.745
Okay. Sorry.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.210
I'm sad too, you know.

25:44.211 --> 25:46.505
Are you? Are you sad?

25:48.257 --> 25:51.134
Stupid crush is different
than eight years of friendship.

26:43.145 --> 26:44.938
I don't understand.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.485
You're a child.

26:53.030 --> 26:55.699
I don't think I've ever even said
more than two words to you.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.703
I guess one time I called you
"the virgin king,"

26:59.786 --> 27:02.706
but that's just 'cause
that's what Christina calls you.

27:04.499 --> 27:05.667
Do you even realize?

27:08.587 --> 27:13.717
Did you even think about the fact
that I'm never gonna grow old?

27:15.010 --> 27:18.096
Never gonna fall in love.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.559
Never going to go to a Beyoncé concert.

27:22.643 --> 27:25.062
I've never even left the fucking country.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.572
What is that?

27:37.282 --> 27:38.825
Who's "incel"?

28:05.477 --> 28:08.355
If Gwyneth Paltrow's head is in here,
I'm gonna be pissed.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.441
Hey! Who left this for me?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.484
Hi.

28:55.194 --> 28:57.946
I think I have something
on that murdered girl, Rebecca Moss.

29:02.743 --> 29:04.119
You got it from here.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.719
Come on. Pick up the phone.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.681
Hello, you've reached
the voice mail of Tina Brons--

29:31.647 --> 29:36.401
When I was 11, I went to sleepaway camp.
One of the places run by the YMCA.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.864
And we would lie around at night
telling ghost stories.

29:40.948 --> 29:45.452
You know, the ones where someone's
writing your name in blood on a mirror,

29:45.536 --> 29:51.291
or, like, there's a man with a hook
for a hand scraping at your car window.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.630
And we'd tell these stories,
and we would scream.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.132
Because they were terrifying.

30:00.843 --> 30:02.803
But also because we loved them.

30:03.637 --> 30:05.848
Stories about people being murdered.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.475
It's funny.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.227
Even if you think about dying,

30:10.310 --> 30:12.646
you don't ever think about being killed.

30:14.731 --> 30:15.899
At least, I didn't.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.404
And it wasn't even personal.

30:22.656 --> 30:26.952
Who teaches a 16-year-old boy
to hate women like that?

30:28.662 --> 30:32.791
And who teaches him
that kind of casual violence?

30:34.918 --> 30:36.670
You should investigate that.

30:36.753 --> 30:37.754
You okay?

30:39.131 --> 30:40.757
Still thinking about the case?

30:41.341 --> 30:44.428
No, actually,
I was thinking about the nature of evil.

30:46.305 --> 30:49.224
My dad, how he drank himself to death.

30:50.642 --> 30:51.643
Right.

30:53.770 --> 30:54.813
I'm gonna go.

30:54.897 --> 30:56.815
You ever read any Milton?

30:56.899 --> 30:58.567
I told you, I don't read books.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.444
Think you'd like him.

31:00.527 --> 31:03.864
Especially Paradise Lost.
It's all about Satan. Fall of man.

31:03.947 --> 31:06.325
Well, you can get it for me
for Christmas then.

31:06.408 --> 31:07.618
Thought you weren't religious.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.453
I'm not, but I still like Christmas.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.039
It's my kids' favorite holiday.

31:13.624 --> 31:14.833
You got kids?
