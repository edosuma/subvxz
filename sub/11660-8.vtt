00:58.633 --> 01:00.033
Who's the letter from, Ma?

01:00.100 --> 01:03.233
Joanne Pescatori.
She's coming to Miami for a visit.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.266
Didn't she own that candy store
down the street from us in Brooklyn?

01:08.333 --> 01:12.333
-That was Jeanette Pasadano.
-Then who was Joanne Pescatori?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.567
How should I know? This letter's for Rose.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.867
Ma, why are you reading Rose's mail?

01:20.333 --> 01:22.333
Because all you got were bills.

01:24.166 --> 01:28.100
-Tell me if you think Joanne's a lesbian.
-Ma!

01:31.533 --> 01:35.600
Hi, Sophia. Hi, Dorothy.
Guess what I've got.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.066
A friend who's a lesbian?

01:38.533 --> 01:41.500
Better. I picked up our weekly lottery
tickets.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.033
It's been such a glorious day.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.333
I was in the mood for leather,
and I found what I wanted.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.400
Just make sure his motorcycle
doesn't block the driveway.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.900
Save the chitchat. If we hit the jackpot,
I want to live long enough to spend it.

01:58.967 --> 02:01.834
-What jackpot?
-I picked up our lottery tickets.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.033
-Ohh!
-How does this go?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.600
To win something,
you need three to match?

02:07.667 --> 02:10.900
If you get three coconuts, you win $100.

02:10.967 --> 02:13.767
What if you get three palm trees?

02:13.834 --> 02:17.400
You don't have palm trees.
That means you win $10,000.

02:17.467 --> 02:21.967
-I know what a palm tree looks like.
-You also know what a doctor looks like.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.367
It doesn't mean you got one.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.567
She's right.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.567
-Three palm trees.
-$10,000.

02:29.900 --> 02:35.800
-Oh, my God. We just won $10,000.
-Oh! I don't believe it!

02:35.867 --> 02:39.467
Split four ways,
that's almost $2,000 a piece.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.133
(Sophia, Blanche and Dorothy) Almost.

02:45.734 --> 02:46.934
Where you going, Ma?

02:47.467 --> 02:50.834
To order that tricycle
with the grocery bag sidecar.

02:52.133 --> 02:55.100
Ride one of those
past a shuffleboard court,

02:55.166 --> 02:57.066
you got guys coming out of your hair.

02:59.133 --> 03:03.467
$10,000. God, life is beautiful!

03:03.533 --> 03:08.266
Now I don't feel guilty about spending
all that money on this leather jacket.

03:08.867 --> 03:14.700
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but
it looks like a jacket someone returned.

03:14.767 --> 03:18.567
-It's kind of beat-up.
-It's supposed to look that way.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.100
It's an aviator jacket.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.734
Now I can afford accessories for it.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.934
-A purse?
-An aviator.

03:28.266 --> 03:31.100
Let's put that lucky ticket
in my jacket pocket

03:31.166 --> 03:35.734
-for safekeeping till tomorrow.
-Let's go out to dinner to celebrate.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.567
What a great idea. I'll go freshen up.

03:38.633 --> 03:40.033
I'll get my purse.

03:40.633 --> 03:43.200
-Where's everybody going?
-To dinner. Get ready.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.400
-I'm ready. I'm always ready.
-(doorbell rings)

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
You do that at 82.
That, and carry hard candy.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.767
Hi, I'm Dave from Lincoln hospital.

03:55.834 --> 03:59.667
If my blood pressure goes up,
I'll call you. Goodbye.

03:59.734 --> 04:00.867
No, wait.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.600
I'm from the thrift shop.
Somebody called about donating old stuff.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.066
Right. These boxes over here.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.867
Wait. This beat-up old thing
must be for you, too.

04:14.567 --> 04:17.433
-Thanks. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.433
-Ok, let's go celebrate.
-We should order champagne.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.533
-And caviar.
-Yahoo, we're rich.

04:25.100 --> 04:29.400
(calm music playing)

04:30.066 --> 04:34.567
-It has to be here somewhere.
-It's not in the laundry room.

04:36.633 --> 04:41.567
-It's not in my bedroom.
-I am positive you left it on the couch.

04:41.633 --> 04:44.700
We got to find that jacket.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.600
I wasn't gonna say anything but
since it's kind of my fault,

04:47.667 --> 04:49.400
I'll pay for it out of my share.

04:49.467 --> 04:53.200
-Kind of your fault?
-Do you know where the jacket is, Sophia?

04:53.266 --> 04:56.667
-What did you do with it, Ma?
-Stand back!

04:59.300 --> 05:00.567
I know how to use this thing.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.367
Spill it, Ma!

05:08.800 --> 05:10.734
I'm scared. I'll do anything you say.

05:12.133 --> 05:15.900
-Where is the jacket, Ma?
-I gave it to the thrift shop.

05:15.967 --> 05:21.066
-Let's go before they sell it.
-It's only an old jacket.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.834
The winning lottery ticket's in the
pocket.

05:23.900 --> 05:28.266
Start the engine. I'll jump in
at the bottom of the driveway.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.767
(serene music playing)

05:41.300 --> 05:42.867
Excuse me, sir.

05:42.934 --> 05:47.367
We're looking for a leather jacket
that got mixed up with clothes we donated.

05:47.433 --> 05:51.367
-It's a terrible mistake.
-It's a regular mistake.

05:51.433 --> 05:54.767
A terrible mistake is when you forget
that <i>Different World </i>follows<i> Cosby.</i>

05:55.734 --> 05:59.467
I picked that stuff up
a couple of hours ago.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.333
-Then it's still here?
-It must be.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.233
-Michael decided to take this.
-That's our jacket. Do something.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.700
I'm sorry, Rose.
I left my flame thrower in my other purse.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.600
Here. Let me handle this.

06:16.467 --> 06:19.133
Ahem. Listen here, mister.
I'd like a word with you.

06:19.200 --> 06:24.400
Before you walk out with that jacket,
there's something I want to say to you.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.734
What?

06:27.433 --> 06:29.000
The zipper sticks a little.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.633
Pardon me. Excuse me, sir.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.834
Would it be possible for me
to try that jacket on?

06:36.900 --> 06:40.066
No time. Michael has to
get to the concert.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.734
I'd like to see this Michael.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.233
You and the rest of Miami.
Sorry. The entire engagement is sold out!

06:49.333 --> 06:50.433
Michael!

06:52.867 --> 06:55.900
-Aah!
-Do you know who that is?

06:55.967 --> 06:58.100
The guy from the Pepsi commercials.

06:59.467 --> 07:04.000
Pepsi commercial? Michael...
oh, my God. That's Michael J. Fox!

07:04.066 --> 07:08.367
-Can we talk to you for a minute?
-Michael, it's very important.

07:08.433 --> 07:10.934
We won't bother you.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.700
(calm music playing)

07:15.734 --> 07:20.100
Yes, that's right. It was a winning ticket
but we gave the jacket away.

07:21.533 --> 07:27.400
Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes,
I'll tell them. They'll appreciate it.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.734
-Bye.
-What'd he say?

07:29.800 --> 07:32.467
He was in total agreement
that it was a miscarriage

07:32.533 --> 07:36.633
-of justice and we deserve the money.
-Oh, that's great.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.567
He also told me
I called his Chinese restaurant

07:39.633 --> 07:41.500
instead of the lottery commission.

07:42.767 --> 07:43.934
Oh.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.934
He felt so bad he's giving us free egg
rolls the next time we come in.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.800
Oh, what's the difference? It's over.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.867
If we don't have the ticket
we can't claim the prize.

07:57.133 --> 08:00.567
Sophia, are you all right?
You haven't said a word in hours.

08:00.867 --> 08:06.200
I was thinking about what I would do
with my share of the winnings.

08:06.533 --> 08:12.734
I wanted to get you something special for
allowing an old woman to live with you.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.667
Oh, Sophia.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.600
Maybe going to a movie
would make us feel better.

08:17.667 --> 08:22.400
-Can we afford it?
-This is ridiculous. We are not poor.

08:22.467 --> 08:25.100
We thought we had $10,000,
and now we don't.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.567
We're no worse off than we were before.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.500
If that was a pep talk, it stunk.

08:31.567 --> 08:36.033
Look. There's a celebrity auction
to benefit the homeless.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.100
They're selling a leather jacket

08:38.166 --> 08:41.567
worn by a major rock star
at his concert last night.

08:41.633 --> 08:42.834
-Let me see it!
-What?

08:43.200 --> 08:46.400
Oh, I don't believe it. This is it.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.166
-Come on. Let's get going.
-We can't go like this.

08:50.233 --> 08:53.367
The auction started 20 minutes ago.

08:55.867 --> 08:58.233
Those gifts I was talking about,

08:58.300 --> 09:01.433
they were tokens of affection,
not actual buffo gifts.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.867
They're cheap?

09:02.934 --> 09:05.967
Just so everyone understands
the ground rules. Let's roll.

09:07.633 --> 09:11.066
(serene music playing)

09:11.133 --> 09:15.100
900 once... 900 twice...

09:15.700 --> 09:18.166
sold! For $900. Congratulations.

09:18.967 --> 09:22.633
And now, moving along to item number 17,

09:22.700 --> 09:27.200
a leather jacket, recently worn in concert

09:27.266 --> 09:29.767
by one of the world's
leading musical talents.

09:29.834 --> 09:33.300
-Get ready, this is it!
-I have a really dumb question.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.066
I have a box of Chiclets.
What's your point?

09:37.967 --> 09:42.633
-How high do we bid?
-High. Even if it costs us $1,000,

09:42.700 --> 09:45.367
-we'll still have $9,000 left.
-Don't start that high.

09:45.433 --> 09:49.600
-We might be able to get it for $200.
-Start at $100.

09:49.667 --> 09:53.934
-Now, may I have an opening bid, please?
-$10,000.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.900
-Excuse me?
-$10,000.

10:01.967 --> 10:06.800
$10,000 once, $10,000 twice.
Sold for $10,000. Thank you so much.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.266
May I say a few words to the audience?

10:10.333 --> 10:12.834
For 10 grand,
he can shower with the audience.

10:13.934 --> 10:17.100
I'll never get to fly on the Concorde.

10:17.166 --> 10:21.734
And I'll never get that emerald pendant
to dangle between my perky bosoms.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.567
And I'll never get to buy perky bosoms.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.600
What the hell.
Nothing else perks on this body.

10:33.867 --> 10:38.033
Maybe we can get the jacket
for just a minute...

10:38.500 --> 10:41.533
-and grab the ticket out of the pocket.
-Great idea.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.800
I'll use friendly persuasion
on that gentleman.

10:44.867 --> 10:50.133
Persuasion, hell. This is for 10 big ones.
Give him whatever he wants.

10:52.700 --> 10:56.033
Sorry. I didn't realize
how much I wanted that money.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.133
Thank you.

10:58.567 --> 11:01.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm congressman Philip Starr.

11:01.367 --> 11:05.333
I've recently been accused
of being insensitive to the homeless.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.300
Well, I think tonight's
sizable cash contribution

11:08.367 --> 11:10.934
should lay those accusations to rest.

11:11.033 --> 11:15.967
-He doesn't care about the jacket.
-Sweet Jesus, this will be easy.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.700
Don't take chances.
Sleep with him anyway.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.133
Sorry.

11:22.834 --> 11:26.166
And as a symbolic gesture
to underscore my concern,

11:26.233 --> 11:28.233
I've done something very special.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.600
In addition to my sizable donation,

11:30.667 --> 11:35.233
I've dispatched my top aide
to one of the shelters in our community

11:35.300 --> 11:37.033
with the jacket I've purchased.

11:37.100 --> 11:41.800
May it provide warmth
to one of our homeless.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.266
We're screwed.

11:49.433 --> 11:56.100
(mellow music playing)

12:04.800 --> 12:09.533
-Are you sure we're in the right place?
-Mission street shelter.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.834
-This is where they sent the jacket.
-Kind of drab, isn't it?

12:12.900 --> 12:16.266
It's a shelter, not the Hilton.

12:18.066 --> 12:21.000
Reminds me of shady pines
retirement home.

12:21.066 --> 12:23.400
Except here the lights
in the exit sign work.

12:24.567 --> 12:27.467
-What's our plan?
-What is this, <i>Mission: Impossible?</i>

12:27.533 --> 12:29.266
Do I look like Peter Graves?

12:30.633 --> 12:32.667
You could if you put a rinse in your hair

12:32.734 --> 12:34.934
and wear a lighter shade
of lipstick like I begged...

12:36.400 --> 12:40.100
I'll tell you our plan.
There's $10,000 at stake.

12:40.166 --> 12:45.767
To find that jacket and get that ticket,
we will lie, cheat, threaten, and steal.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.867
-Oh, hello.
-Anybody got a backup plan?

12:50.166 --> 12:52.867
I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was out
here. I was just locking up.

12:52.934 --> 12:55.734
Father, we need your help.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.467
I'm not sure we have enough empty beds.
But you're welcome to stay.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.200
-We don't want to stay--
-Yes, we do.

13:02.633 --> 13:06.000
We have to tonight.
There's no need to be embarrassed.

13:06.066 --> 13:09.033
We don't judge.
We keep you safe and warm.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.033
Let me get you some pillows.

13:11.467 --> 13:14.266
-This is insane.
-I'm not leaving without that jacket.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.834
I'm with Blanche. We've come this far.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.200
After we get inside
we can split up and look.

13:18.266 --> 13:21.100
Here are your pillows.
Blankets are on the bed.

13:21.166 --> 13:24.266
Light's out in just a few minutes.
The beds are through here.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.467
Oh.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.667
Are you going to tie a bow on that
when you finish wrapping it?

13:54.133 --> 13:57.900
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I'm a bit compulsive.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.800
It's the Minnesota farm girl in me.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.500
-You're from Minnesota?
-Yes.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.600
No kidding. So am I.

14:04.433 --> 14:08.100
What a coincidence. Isn't that amazing?

14:08.433 --> 14:12.266
-Saint Olaf.
-Ben Weedin. Pleased to meet you.

14:15.433 --> 14:19.700
Oh, my name's Rose Nylund.
I come from St. Olaf.

14:19.767 --> 14:24.734
Oh, I should've known.
Too much to expect a miracle this late.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.834
-What happened?
-Oh, bedtime, Rose.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.734
Does that mean no talking?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.333
No. They just like you
to stay in your own beds.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.333
Oh, darn. I didn't get to brush my teeth.

14:41.266 --> 14:45.400
I know how you feel.
I brush after every meal.

14:46.567 --> 14:48.633
You wouldn't happen
to have a meal on you?

14:57.533 --> 15:00.700
-What are you staring at?
-Your purse.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.734
You just be careful, son.

15:03.066 --> 15:06.934
There's a long list of men who bear
the scars of trying the wrong thing

15:07.000 --> 15:08.500
at the wrong time with me.

15:09.133 --> 15:12.800
Scars, I might add,
not visible to the public.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.133
I thought you might have some gum.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.066
Oh.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.033
Well, I might.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.633
-You want me to look?
-Forget it.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you.
I'm just a little uncomfortable here.

15:30.834 --> 15:33.266
It helps to stuff newspapers
under the mattress.

15:33.700 --> 15:38.333
I didn't mean that.
I meant being here... at the shelter.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.066
It's your first time?

15:41.367 --> 15:44.166
Oh, lord, it's been ages since I heard
that from a man.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.967
Yes, it is my first time.

15:57.033 --> 16:01.200
-I'll give you some pointers.
-Now, that I've never heard from a man.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.133
-You comfortable, Ma?
-Oh, yeah.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.367
Before we leave I want to get the model
number off this cot.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.000
I'm hoping Ethan Allen
makes one in knotty pine.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.500
Ma, try to make the best of it.

16:18.567 --> 16:23.433
I don't think Blanche or Rose
spotted the jacket.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.667
I don't believe it. That's Ida Perkins.

16:29.567 --> 16:30.600
What?

16:31.066 --> 16:33.867
Ida Perkins.
What the hell is she doing here?

16:34.300 --> 16:37.033
Were you kidding me
about being from Minnesota?

16:37.100 --> 16:42.900
Absolutely not. I spent 22 years
working the prime noon to 8:00 shift

16:42.967 --> 16:45.600
at the Minneapolis excelsior hotel.

16:45.967 --> 16:49.166
I don't believe it.
Where'd you live in Minneapolis?

16:49.233 --> 16:51.934
Oh, lots of places.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.233
My last home was near
the intersection of Bartholomew and third.

16:55.300 --> 16:59.533
Oh, that's a lovely neighborhood.
Why did you leave?

16:59.600 --> 17:01.700
I like to entertain...

17:01.767 --> 17:06.200
but the cardboard box I was living in was
only suitable for small dinner parties.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.100
Breakfast is cereal and coffee.

17:12.166 --> 17:15.734
If you don't have a quarter,
no one fusses.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.734
Just get there early. Often they run out.

17:19.367 --> 17:22.900
Well, lovely as that sounds, Kenny,
I usually skip breakfast.

17:23.367 --> 17:27.166
When you reach 45,
you have to keep an eye on your figure.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.700
Blanche, who are you fooling?

17:30.567 --> 17:32.033
Oh, all right, 48.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.967
No. I mean what are you doing here?
You don't belong here.

17:38.033 --> 17:42.300
-I most certainly do.
-Hey, it's ok. I'm just curious.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.834
-I don't belong here either.
-You don't?

17:44.900 --> 17:50.433
No. I'm a graduate student, undercover,
working on my doctorate in sociology.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.033
Now, I knew it.

17:52.100 --> 17:57.367
When we started talking, I said to myself
how could such a bright boy end up here?

17:57.834 --> 17:59.633
You're more like my own son

17:59.700 --> 18:04.433
than those people
stopping strangers for spare change.

18:05.166 --> 18:08.233
Oh, well, that explains it all.
Now I feel much better.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.734
So you're really a student working
on your doctorate?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.767
I'm really an alcoholic
who needs a place to sleep.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.400
-What?
-It's true.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.500
I've already got my doctorate.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.633
-We had some great times, didn't we, Ida?
-We sure did.

18:27.133 --> 18:32.367
Dorothy... Ida was the best, bar none,
at faking an angina attack at dinner...

18:32.433 --> 18:35.834
so we could swap our nonfat yogurt
for real sour cream.

18:36.834 --> 18:40.233
Every patient at shady pines
blessed Ida Perkins

18:40.300 --> 18:42.333
every time they sat down to eat
a baked potato.

18:44.700 --> 18:49.867
-When did you leave the home?
-Maybe a year now. I don't keep track.

18:49.934 --> 18:53.533
-What made you decide to leave?
-Decide?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.834
Some things in life
you never get to decide.

18:57.533 --> 19:01.133
-Some things just happen.
-What happened, Ida?

19:01.967 --> 19:03.500
I didn't know.

19:03.567 --> 19:07.834
Nobody told me that it
cost money to get old.

19:08.633 --> 19:12.166
I just figured that was one thing
you'd get for free.

19:12.900 --> 19:13.967
(Ida) It isn't.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.233
The home costs money,
the doctors cost money,

19:18.300 --> 19:20.266
medicine costs money.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.767
You know, I always thought it was sad.
I outlived my whole family.

19:26.667 --> 19:31.300
But... but I never knew
it was going to be a punishment.

19:33.734 --> 19:37.600
The hotel business started to slump.
Hundreds of people got laid off.

19:37.967 --> 19:41.033
I went looking for work,
but believe it or not,

19:41.100 --> 19:45.767
most businesses aren't anxious to train
a 55-year-old black hotel porter.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.433
Go figure it, huh?

19:48.533 --> 19:49.834
It's all about pressure...

19:50.266 --> 19:53.400
from family, from professors,
from friends.

19:53.967 --> 19:56.133
No room to slide. Have to be perfect.

19:56.734 --> 19:57.900
Guess what, Blanche.

19:58.433 --> 19:59.567
I'm not perfect.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.333
So they sent me a letter.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.734
The money was gone.

20:07.066 --> 20:08.433
I asked for some help.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.166
They gave me some phone numbers.

20:12.734 --> 20:13.767
Hmm.

20:14.867 --> 20:17.600
The Minnesota streets were cold.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.834
It took nearly three months,
but I finally made it to Miami.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.667
Listen to me, just running on.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.967
Tell you what, you tell me your sad story
over breakfast. Good night.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.500
I couldn't survive out there...

20:34.233 --> 20:35.867
but I'm learning to survive here...

20:37.066 --> 20:39.900
which reminds me, hold onto that purse.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.233
I didn't really want any gum.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.700
I wander now.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.200
I don't decide anything anymore.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.367
I... wait for things to happen.

21:12.333 --> 21:15.367
-Time to look for the jacket.
-Let's split up.

21:15.667 --> 21:16.700

People care.
