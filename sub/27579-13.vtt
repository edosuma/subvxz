No costume, Fred?

00:48.585 --> 00:51.854

Halloween costume,

00:51.921 --> 00:54.491

(CLICKING)

00:54.557 --> 00:57.994
Forager is the perfect

I don't even know
how you guys talked me
into going to this thing.

01:07.037 --> 01:11.573
Forager understands
Victor Stone won't know
any of the other teens.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.476
-But...
-That's the saving grace.

01:13.543 --> 01:18.114
I can be a stranger
crushing a costume
but not an alien metal freak.

01:18.181 --> 01:20.049
-Uh...
-I know, I know.

01:20.116 --> 01:21.618

Sorry guys, but we're going
to Greater Bialya

01:29.325 --> 01:32.327
We have a solid lead

01:32.394 --> 01:33.562

01:33.629 --> 01:35.398
VIOLET: So am I.

01:35.465 --> 01:37.734
Although I would prefer
to change into
my Halo clothes first.

01:37.801 --> 01:42.801
Sorry Violet, I need you
to stay here in case Vic needs
another Halo cleanse.

01:43.105 --> 01:46.008
See? Maybe being
a potentially murderous freak

01:46.075 --> 01:47.977
is not such a good thing
after all.

01:48.044 --> 01:50.345
But, but Brion...

01:50.412 --> 01:52.181
He'll be all right.

01:52.248 --> 01:56.752

What do we know
and how do we know it?

03:16.299 --> 03:18.601
What we know begins
with these VR goggles,

03:18.668 --> 03:21.705
manufactured by
Gretchen Goode's
Goode World Studios.

03:21.771 --> 03:24.908
A friend of ours,
Garfield Logan, learned
the hard way,

03:24.975 --> 03:27.843
that the goggles were designed
<i>to test for the meta-gene.</i>

03:27.910 --> 03:29.946
If the subject tests positive,

03:30.013 --> 03:32.916
<i>subliminal messages
</i> <i>begin to brainwash
</i> <i>the potential meta-human,</i>

03:32.983 --> 03:36.619
<i>sending the subject
</i> <i>to a specific location
</i> <i>in the vicinity.</i>

03:36.686 --> 03:38.954
<i>These locations
</i> <i>seem to be depots,</i>

03:39.021 --> 03:40.824
<i>trading posts for meta-teens.</i>

03:40.891 --> 03:42.959
As we speak,
the Justice League
and the team

03:43.026 --> 03:46.563
are sending squads to
take down all these
depots simultaneously,

03:46.629 --> 03:49.165
so one location
can't tip off another.

03:49.232 --> 03:51.434
We're hitting the depot
in Greater Bialya.

03:51.501 --> 03:53.269
Since when are we
working for the League?

03:53.336 --> 03:56.872
We're not, but Garfield gave
the goggle intel to M'gann,

03:56.939 --> 03:59.042
who took it
to the League first.

03:59.109 --> 04:02.111
Fortunately, she made sure
we got the Bialyan gig because
of the Tara connection.

04:02.178 --> 04:03.712
What is the Tara connection?

04:03.779 --> 04:05.815
Intel from another source.

04:05.882 --> 04:10.019
<i>A tip that the Shadows
</i> <i>handed Tara over to someone
</i> <i>named Granny.</i>

04:10.086 --> 04:12.622
<i>Unfortunately,Granny was too generic a term.</i>

04:12.689 --> 04:14.457
<i>Could've meant anyone
</i> <i>or anything.</i>

04:14.524 --> 04:16.693
<i>But since Gar made
</i> <i>the Goode goggles connection,</i>

04:16.760 --> 04:20.062
<i>we now believe
</i> <i>that Granny refers
</i> <i>to Gretchen Goode's nickname</i>

04:20.129 --> 04:22.265
<i>in the popular press,
</i> <i>"Granny Goodness".</i>

04:22.331 --> 04:24.401
<i>And remember Jakar Marlowe?</i>

04:24.468 --> 04:28.705
<i>We thought he might have
</i> <i>been killed by a Shadow
</i> <i>wielding Geo-Force powers</i>

04:28.772 --> 04:31.775
It turns out Marlowe worked
for Goode R&D on the goggles.

04:31.841 --> 04:35.045
<i>Moreover, he was
</i> <i>the buyer off record
</i> <i>for a Goode shell company,</i>

04:35.112 --> 04:37.981

</i> <i>in Greater Bialya,</i>

04:38.048 --> 04:41.484

</i> <i>hacked off the goggles.</i>

05:24.226 --> 05:25.862

to relax her.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.270

It's a very sad story.

05:36.939 --> 05:39.008
She was taken from me.

05:39.074 --> 05:41.444

05:52.455 --> 05:56.505

06:21.084 --> 06:25.488

for Brion will affect
