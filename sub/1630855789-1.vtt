WEBVTT

00:44.194 --> 00:47.471
For centuries, my people, the Lokkein,

00:47.513 --> 00:49.226
were oppressed by the Kameen.

00:50.093 --> 00:54.521
Fed up, we fought back in a war between our species.

00:54.563 --> 00:56.021
We failed.

00:56.063 --> 00:57.521
The battles were brutal,

00:57.563 --> 00:59.771
and too many of our kind were slaughtered.

00:59.813 --> 01:03.371
The Lokkein who survived were exiled

01:03.413 --> 01:05.891
to a new planet called Rockachie.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.681
Water is scarce here, and life on Rockachie

01:08.723 --> 01:12.131
is supported by a liquid we have named Zahd.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.131
However, Zahd does not contain enough nutrients

01:15.173 --> 01:19.421
to sustain us without the
use of the Rejuvenation Vial.

01:19.463 --> 01:22.991
Once a year, the prefect of each village

01:23.033 --> 01:26.471
is tasked with putting the smallest drop of liquid

01:26.513 --> 01:30.131
from the Rejuvenation Vial into the soil.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.631
But we must be careful.

01:31.673 --> 01:33.911
If we put more than just a drop,

01:33.953 --> 01:37.121
it will rejuvenate the entire planet with water,

01:37.163 --> 01:38.741
and this could be dangerous

01:38.783 --> 01:41.456
to all living things native to Rockachie.

01:42.623 --> 01:47.623
Meanwhile, our enemies, the
Kameen, have abused their planet

01:47.693 --> 01:51.401
and used up all of their natural resources.

01:51.443 --> 01:54.311
Fearing that the Kameen will come to Rockachie

01:54.353 --> 01:56.651
and take our Rejuvenation Vial,

01:56.693 --> 01:58.781
we have hidden it outside our village,

01:58.823 --> 02:01.241
where dangerous beasts roam free,

02:01.283 --> 02:03.161
in the hopes that this will deter them

02:03.203 --> 02:06.676
from destroying our lives once again.

02:11.093 --> 02:12.701
Brocheet, glad to see

02:12.743 --> 02:14.381
you're reaching your destination.

02:14.423 --> 02:16.601
After a minor course correction,

02:16.643 --> 02:19.121
I should be landing on the Rockachie surface

02:19.163 --> 02:20.261
within the hour.

02:20.303 --> 02:24.401
- Good.
- You are our most skilled warrior.

02:24.443 --> 02:26.981
Our civilization is depending on you to find

02:27.023 --> 02:29.184
the water of Rockachie.

02:29.226 --> 02:31.541
I don't have to remind you of how many days

02:31.583 --> 02:33.311
of water we have left.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.451
No, sir.

02:34.493 --> 02:35.531
- If we can find this vial,

02:35.573 --> 02:39.491
it will bring life back to our dying planet,

02:39.533 --> 02:41.561
and all of the Kameen will have

02:41.603 --> 02:44.321
sustainable drinking water again,

02:44.363 --> 02:49.363
so we cannot underestimate
the importance of this mission.

02:49.883 --> 02:51.491
- Of course, General.

02:51.533 --> 02:55.751
Now, this is my first mission
to the Lokkein scum world.

02:55.793 --> 02:59.081
The scriptures say that
there are horrific creatures

02:59.123 --> 03:01.871
that will kill even the most skilled warriors

03:01.913 --> 03:04.961
if they venture outside the Lokkein settlement.

03:05.003 --> 03:09.821
- We have found a few beasts that cause some trouble.

03:09.863 --> 03:11.954
We call them Dwellers.

03:13.253 --> 03:15.898
On our first mission, they seized control

03:15.940 --> 03:19.946
of one of our ships and quickly made it their home.

03:20.873 --> 03:24.371
After that mistake, we realized they like to make

03:24.413 --> 03:27.851
any location they find their newest domicile.

03:27.893 --> 03:31.151
- I hope that you have some better intel for me,

03:31.193 --> 03:34.901
or am I supposed to wander
the waste looking for this vial?

03:34.943 --> 03:39.731
- We recently discovered that the Lokkein have a map

03:39.773 --> 03:44.351
that will lead us directly to the vial.

03:44.393 --> 03:49.193
Last week, we set our top agent, K'veen,

03:51.593 --> 03:55.511
to retrieve it, but lost communication

03:55.553 --> 03:56.653
with him this morning.

03:57.593 --> 04:00.071
- Well, that was your first mistake.

04:00.113 --> 04:01.181
- Huh?

04:01.223 --> 04:04.191
- K'veen isn't your top agent.

04:04.233 --> 04:07.301
Ah!

04:07.343 --> 04:10.241
Glad to have you back, Brocheet.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.980
Make us all proud.

04:15.626 --> 04:19.000
- It's a good thing you're coming along, Giree.

04:19.043 --> 04:20.831
I have a feeling I'm going to need

04:20.873 --> 04:23.411
your Peesh-healing abilities

04:23.453 --> 04:27.332
if we run into this Dweller creature.

05:29.687 --> 05:31.001
Good morning, Lock.

05:31.043 --> 05:32.350
Good morning.

05:33.263 --> 05:34.663
How much dew did we collect?

05:35.633 --> 05:39.341
- It's not much, but it's better than drinking

05:39.383 --> 05:40.511
just the Zahd we dig up.

05:40.553 --> 05:43.511
- I know. We'll save it for a special night.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.528
At least our Zahd site is full.

05:46.643 --> 05:50.951
I know it tastes bad, but its
nutrients have kept us alive.

05:50.993 --> 05:52.631
- We should ask the prefect for more water.

05:52.673 --> 05:53.951
- You know, we can't.

05:53.993 --> 05:55.541
He's in charge of the distribution,

05:55.583 --> 05:56.833
and we have no say in it.

05:58.313 --> 06:01.151
- Water shouldn't just be a
treat for special occasions.

06:01.193 --> 06:04.871
- And what are you going to do, go find the vial yourself?

06:04.913 --> 06:06.491
- We can use just a little bit.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.431
We don't have to rejuvenate the entire planet.

06:09.473 --> 06:12.611
If we just use enough to get our rivers full-

06:12.653 --> 06:15.011
- The prefect is never going to let you do this.

06:15.053 --> 06:16.811
- I know, I know, the ecosystem.

06:16.853 --> 06:19.211
- Here, help me take this to the digging site

06:19.253 --> 06:21.403
so we can meet our Zahd quota for the week.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.731
Zahd just tastes so bad.

06:24.773 --> 06:25.564
- I know, I know.

06:25.606 --> 06:27.011
We'll have a nice dinner tomorrow

06:27.053 --> 06:28.556
with the water we collected.

06:32.482 --> 06:33.748
Oh my Chokk!

06:33.790 --> 06:37.623
Prefect Lukon?

06:45.350 --> 06:48.313
Prefect!

06:48.355 --> 06:49.523
- Are you okay, sir?

06:49.565 --> 06:50.648
- Lock, Kaak.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.332
- Yes, what happened?

06:56.954 --> 06:59.015
- This Kameen here.

06:59.057 --> 07:00.442
What is he doing here?

07:02.534 --> 07:05.358
- That ugly bastard destroyed the site

07:05.400 --> 07:09.461
and tried to steal all our scrolls.

07:09.503 --> 07:14.078
I took him down, but only after he shot me.

07:15.822 --> 07:17.188
Prefect!

07:17.230 --> 07:19.541
- He was looking for this.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.238
The Scroll of Rockachie?

07:21.280 --> 07:24.986
- Yes. I heard him say Kameen is running out of water.

07:26.153 --> 07:29.396
They're looking for the vial.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.366
Here!

07:32.333 --> 07:33.998
Take the scroll.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.890
You must get the Water of
Rockachie before the Kameen do.

07:39.698 --> 07:42.503
- Uh-huh. - You must keep it safe.

07:45.773 --> 07:49.391
Promise me you'll find the vial.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.291
- Uh-huh.

07:50.333 --> 07:54.456
- We can't allow the Kameen
to take anything more from us.

07:55.794 --> 07:59.530
We promise!

07:59.572 --> 08:00.489
- One thing

08:01.903 --> 08:03.736
the Kameen don't know.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.769
The Kameen

08:07.811 --> 08:11.787
don't know that

08:11.829 --> 08:12.662
you can't

08:13.784 --> 08:14.617
use too...

08:15.668 --> 08:20.668
Prefect!

08:27.526 --> 08:28.443
- Love live

08:30.276 --> 08:31.626
Kameen!

08:31.668 --> 08:33.499
Kaak, look out!

08:37.932 --> 08:39.268
No!

08:39.309 --> 08:42.206
Kaak!

08:42.248 --> 08:43.331
Stay with me.

08:45.746 --> 08:49.746
Kaak!

08:50.957 --> 08:52.374
I love you, Kaak.

09:16.430 --> 09:20.430
Kaak!

09:27.325 --> 09:30.033
If the vial can help

09:30.893 --> 09:32.906
save an entire planet,

09:34.643 --> 09:37.046
there's a chance it could help you too.

09:38.235 --> 09:41.854
Right?

09:41.896 --> 09:42.729
Right?

09:47.393 --> 09:48.480
I've got to try.

11:18.677 --> 11:23.054
Boolock. More Kameen.

11:23.096 --> 11:26.868
- Come on up here, my hairless Peesh friend.

11:30.893 --> 11:34.856
Mission log: I'm entering the atmosphere now.

11:39.293 --> 11:42.971
Okay, Giree. Be careful when we land.

11:43.013 --> 11:46.982
We have no idea if that Dweller will be nearby.

11:51.623 --> 11:56.006
Ah, that's a perfect landing spot.

11:57.102 --> 12:02.102
Come eye.

12:33.413 --> 12:34.246
Giree!

12:36.623 --> 12:38.981
Come on out, it's safe.

12:39.023 --> 12:40.356
- Oh, is it? - Huh?

12:47.128 --> 12:48.766
Why are you here, Kameen?

13:37.797 --> 13:39.161
Better him than me.

14:34.690 --> 14:35.523
Uh...

14:36.754 --> 14:37.878
Uh...

14:37.920 --> 14:39.743
Just hold on a second!

14:46.050 --> 14:51.050
Get off me, you beast!

14:51.577 --> 14:52.368
Get in there!

14:56.356 --> 15:00.821
And you'll stay in there till
you die, you Kameen parasite!

15:07.995 --> 15:12.995
How do you live
with yourself smelling like that?

15:14.611 --> 15:15.539
Shut up!

15:18.053 --> 15:19.521
I said quiet!

17:36.320 --> 17:40.984
Giree?

17:41.026 --> 17:44.872
Giree!

17:50.064 --> 17:50.981
Where am I?

17:53.016 --> 17:55.099
Chokk dammit, where am I?

18:09.779 --> 18:11.362
Let me out of here!

18:24.823 --> 18:26.486
Delitch was right.

18:29.663 --> 18:32.636
This is one of our ships.

19:21.775 --> 19:23.381
You,

19:23.423 --> 19:24.256
Lokkein!

19:25.523 --> 19:26.596
Where's Giree?

19:28.013 --> 19:31.391
If you hurt her, I swear I'll rip these chains off

19:31.433 --> 19:36.376
and kill you before the thing does.

19:37.493 --> 19:42.493
Can you hear me, Lokkein,
through that thick skull of yours?

19:43.463 --> 19:44.786
- Giree?

19:45.623 --> 19:47.771
Is that its name?

19:47.813 --> 19:50.876
- I swear I'll kill you if you hurt her!

19:52.166 --> 19:56.755
- That ugly thing is locked
away in a cage where it belongs!

19:57.630 --> 20:02.545
Probably about to be that
beast's appetizer as we speak.

20:02.587 --> 20:07.086
I swear I'll kill you!

20:07.128 --> 20:10.061
- I have a feeling you'd kill me

20:10.103 --> 20:12.907
whether that Peesh was alive or not.

20:41.151 --> 20:42.984
- Is... Is that Giree?

20:47.548 --> 20:48.631
Hey, Lokkein!

20:49.711 --> 20:50.878
Is that Giree?

20:53.492 --> 20:55.992
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

20:57.297 --> 21:01.391
Is that Giree?

21:01.433 --> 21:04.331
- You should learn to say please

21:04.373 --> 21:07.680
when something is so important to you!

21:22.782 --> 21:23.949
- Thank Chokk.

21:35.883 --> 21:36.884
Thank you.

23:10.004 --> 23:13.841
I can't do this.

23:13.883 --> 23:15.446
Any ideas, Kameen?

23:18.497 --> 23:19.330
- Yeah.

23:20.243 --> 23:22.063
Go piss off.

23:56.513 --> 23:58.732
- Good morning, Kameen.

24:00.144 --> 24:03.131
And I thought you smelled

24:03.173 --> 24:05.456
like Peesh piss yesterday.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.101
You are extra rotten.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.221
- You always were the worst species.

24:12.263 --> 24:14.636
That's why we shipped you all off Kameen.

24:20.213 --> 24:23.336
I will find the vial to rejuvenate Kameen,

24:24.323 --> 24:27.881
and the rest of you will be stuck drinking Zahd

24:27.923 --> 24:31.961
till the end of your miserable lives!

24:32.003 --> 24:37.003
- Just one more advantage above us, right?

24:37.507 --> 24:41.201
Oh, woe is me!

24:41.243 --> 24:45.431
We gave you your own planet, plenty of rations,

24:45.473 --> 24:47.951
and even a start on building

24:47.993 --> 24:51.401
your own self-sustaining community!

24:51.443 --> 24:55.126
If there's any failure, it's on your kind.

24:55.168 --> 24:57.114
Boolock!

24:59.596 --> 25:04.596
When the Kameen shipped us
here, you starved us and beat us,

25:04.703 --> 25:06.971
and killed off nearly half our kind!

25:07.013 --> 25:09.491
- Maybe if your kind was stronger,

25:09.533 --> 25:11.891
you wouldn't have lost the war.

25:11.933 --> 25:15.911
Maybe if you had accepted your defeat,

25:15.953 --> 25:18.986
we wouldn't have had to kill so many of you.

25:20.393 --> 25:24.371
- It's hard to win against someone who has control

25:24.413 --> 25:27.866
over an animal that can heal any wound.

25:28.973 --> 25:31.871
The Peesh make you practically immortal,

25:31.913 --> 25:34.511
and you have captured every single one!

25:34.553 --> 25:36.416
- We did not capture the Peesh!

25:37.583 --> 25:40.811
They choose to stay with us. They are family!

25:40.853 --> 25:45.611
- They stay with you because you feed them.

25:45.653 --> 25:49.091
They're not family, they're pets.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.451
And you outlawed any Lokkein from adopting one,

25:52.493 --> 25:54.731
giving you the upper hand.

25:54.773 --> 25:56.323
- You act like I made that law.

25:57.563 --> 26:00.101
It's been in place for generations,

26:00.143 --> 26:03.068
put there by the founders

26:03.110 --> 26:06.740
- And all the founders just happened to be Kameen!

26:09.263 --> 26:14.024
- Well, I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.

26:14.066 --> 26:17.576
- Well you know what is your problem?

26:19.553 --> 26:20.386
Water,

26:21.349 --> 26:23.432
and look who has the map.

26:25.413 --> 26:27.341
- How do you have that?

26:27.383 --> 26:29.561
There's no way that's real!

26:29.603 --> 26:31.834
Okay, Peesh Boolock.

27:21.863 --> 27:24.206
- You better learn to keep that down,

27:25.493 --> 27:29.576
or else you'll starve to death before he eats you.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.500
- Why don't you mind your business, Peesh lover?

29:12.686 --> 29:15.116
Does yours taste like piss too?

29:17.513 --> 29:18.566
- Yes.

29:41.003 --> 29:42.536
- I can't do this anymore.

29:44.903 --> 29:47.750
- Is that your way of asking for help?

29:57.830 --> 29:58.663
- Yes.

30:00.803 --> 30:02.531
- Why should I trust you?

30:02.573 --> 30:07.573
- I shouldn't trust you, but I'm going out on a limb here!

30:07.926 --> 30:10.436
I have a dead husband who I'm trying to save!

30:12.413 --> 30:14.426
I will do anything for him,

30:15.533 --> 30:17.621
even if it means having to trust you

30:17.663 --> 30:19.076
for a few seconds today.

30:20.123 --> 30:21.941
- You have a husband?

30:21.983 --> 30:24.821
- What, you don't think Lokkein can be monogamous?

30:24.863 --> 30:25.696
- Enough!

30:27.653 --> 30:28.781
How did he die?

30:28.823 --> 30:31.241
- One of you killed him!

30:31.283 --> 30:32.786
- My wife is dead too.

30:33.683 --> 30:38.351
You Lokkein killed her in the war 20 years ago.

30:38.393 --> 30:39.543
- Where was Giree then?

30:40.793 --> 30:42.926
- Peesh can't save everybody!

30:44.483 --> 30:47.066
Sometimes, it's too late.

30:48.863 --> 30:50.996
Sometimes, they're too far gone.

30:54.918 --> 30:57.440
I'm sorry about your husband.

30:58.703 --> 31:02.051
I know how strong the bond of a mate can be.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.083
- Real touching, Kameen.

31:06.806 --> 31:08.973
Listen, I don't trust you,

31:11.033 --> 31:14.951
but let's get out of here and go our separate ways, okay?

31:14.993 --> 31:19.646
- I'd love to and when I do, I'll be taking that map.

31:21.983 --> 31:23.846
- What if we get the vial together?

31:24.863 --> 31:27.731
I just need a drop to bring my husband back to life.

31:27.773 --> 31:32.381
- That vial is meant to rejuvenate the planet.

31:32.423 --> 31:36.251
Scriptures say nothing
about bringing back the dead.

31:36.293 --> 31:39.311
- Well, if it can heal your planet,

31:39.353 --> 31:42.266
there's a chance it can bring him back to life.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.476
That's my only option.

31:46.523 --> 31:48.326
You can have the rest after.

31:49.313 --> 31:52.811
I will gladly drink Zahd for the rest of my life

31:52.853 --> 31:55.541
if it means I can have him by my side again.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.780
- Fine, but I'm in charge.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.953
A Kameen will never follow a Lokkein!

32:02.995 --> 32:04.870
Chokk dammit, Kameen!

32:07.784 --> 32:12.011
- I'm ready to put all of our history aside

32:12.053 --> 32:14.216
so that we both can live.

32:15.083 --> 32:18.530
Do you want to get out of here, Kameen?

32:18.572 --> 32:21.206
- I don't have a choice. I must.

32:25.313 --> 32:26.867
- My name's Lock.

32:26.909 --> 32:31.159
Locke is a Kameen name.

32:32.123 --> 32:34.151
Did your parents name you that

32:34.193 --> 32:36.926
in some feeble attempt to elevate you?

32:38.243 --> 32:41.711
- I was named after my adoptive mother.

32:41.753 --> 32:44.804
- You were adopted by Kameens?

32:44.846 --> 32:47.171
- They were killed in the war

32:47.213 --> 32:51.627
for being Lokkein sympathizers!

33:00.128 --> 33:02.295
- My wife's name was Lock.

33:06.977 --> 33:08.144
It's Brocheet.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.724
My name is Brocheet.

33:19.663 --> 33:22.406
So how do you propose we get out of here?

33:23.573 --> 33:26.726
- Well, this thing has us chained up for a reason.

33:27.653 --> 33:29.936
I'm assuming by the pile of bones,

33:30.893 --> 33:32.276
it's planning to eat us.

33:33.173 --> 33:35.171
I think it wants to fatten us up.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.363
- No Boolock!

33:37.823 --> 33:40.031
I could have told you that.

33:40.073 --> 33:43.011
- Well, at some point, he's going to unchain these.

33:43.053 --> 33:46.781
If we work together, we can overpower him.

33:46.823 --> 33:51.161
- That's your plan, to wait until he takes these off?

33:51.203 --> 33:52.978
I don't have the time!

33:53.020 --> 33:56.666
Kameen will perish within
the week if I don't get that vial!

33:57.623 --> 34:00.686
- Well, let's give him a reason to eat us sooner.

34:03.893 --> 34:07.353
- I can't believe I'm going to do this.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.964
Fine.

34:11.956 --> 34:12.956
Wake him up.

34:15.049 --> 34:17.487
- Okay, let's do this.

35:05.180 --> 35:08.690
- You have to use something bigger than a bone.

35:13.350 --> 35:14.517
Wake up, ugly!

35:15.369 --> 35:18.252
Boolock, nice shot!

35:21.958 --> 35:23.469
My arm!

35:37.116 --> 35:39.604
Brocheet, hold him there!

35:39.646 --> 35:41.979
Take your time!

36:06.549 --> 36:07.382
- Wake up!

36:08.755 --> 36:09.588
Brocheet!

36:11.523 --> 36:16.523
Are you in there?

36:23.363 --> 36:28.363
Really? All that talk and you died that easy.

36:28.947 --> 36:32.530
Ah, this arm is never gonna heal. Brocheet!

37:01.897 --> 37:03.397
Rest well, Kameen.

37:04.798 --> 37:06.306
Brocheet.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.714
Brocheet!

38:40.053 --> 38:44.476
Boolock! Those things don't stay down.

39:02.430 --> 39:04.097
Well, that's unique.

39:07.510 --> 39:11.598
I need that damn med kit.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.658
Wow.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.700
That is a big rasteniya.

40:10.128 --> 40:11.628
I've got be close.

40:22.075 --> 40:25.742
I'm on the right path. The vial is that way.

40:30.170 --> 40:32.587
But I'm so close to the ship.

40:40.608 --> 40:42.678
The detour is needed.

42:27.928 --> 42:29.845
Ah, this is gonna hurt.

43:03.126 --> 43:04.852
Giree?

43:04.894 --> 43:05.894
Is that you?

43:07.705 --> 43:09.159
Whoa, wait!

43:17.801 --> 43:20.384
Wait. I know where Brocheet is.

43:25.489 --> 43:26.359
He's dead.

43:27.761 --> 43:29.449
I tried to help him.

43:31.838 --> 43:34.421
No, I did. He helped me escape.

43:37.235 --> 43:39.902
But the creature was too strong.

43:45.081 --> 43:45.914
Listen...

43:52.553 --> 43:56.396
I can take you

43:56.438 --> 43:58.207
to Brocheet's body.

44:01.121 --> 44:02.704
I need some of that

44:05.059 --> 44:06.809
Peesh healing you do.

44:10.675 --> 44:12.258
This isn't a trick.

44:14.595 --> 44:16.845
I know you can heal wounds.

44:22.083 --> 44:24.750
To

44:25.867 --> 44:26.700
Brocheet.

45:42.230 --> 45:43.616
You fixed my arm.

45:48.264 --> 45:49.808
Spasiba.

45:54.023 --> 45:56.876
Yes, to Brocheet's body.

45:58.163 --> 46:02.947
But first, will you please help me with my husband?

46:05.723 --> 46:07.466
If you can heal my arm,

46:08.513 --> 46:11.343
you can bring him back to life, right?

46:14.543 --> 46:15.386
Please!

46:17.020 --> 46:18.926
A Kameen killed him.

46:20.213 --> 46:22.046
He was everything to me.

46:23.543 --> 46:24.591
Please.

46:28.764 --> 46:30.764
Okay, to Brocheet first,

46:35.594 --> 46:39.379
but then will you please help me save Kaak?

48:02.856 --> 48:05.439
Yeah, I know where we're going.

48:11.096 --> 48:12.446
Mm-hmm.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.566
Over here, Giree!

49:01.706 --> 49:03.551
Stay here and rest.

49:03.593 --> 49:06.038
I'm going to go find some Jolek for us to eat.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.304
I'll be back.

49:27.713 --> 49:30.496
Hey, Lokkein.

49:32.308 --> 49:33.641
Are you still...

49:39.136 --> 49:44.136
She stabbed me in the back!

49:44.343 --> 49:48.100
Never trust a Lokkein.

49:58.095 --> 49:59.512
I can't die here.

50:01.435 --> 50:06.435
You gotta get that vial!

50:23.349 --> 50:24.182
Come on!

53:48.644 --> 53:50.561
- Well, I'll be damned.

54:25.861 --> 54:29.008
This damn plant!

54:32.662 --> 54:34.579
The Water of Rockachie.

54:37.872 --> 54:42.872
It's hard to believe that this
little bottle can do so much.

54:54.456 --> 54:59.083
I like you guys this size better.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.752
I know, I know! Okay, you caught me.

55:21.683 --> 55:26.458
I went to get the vial, but it was only a small detour.

55:27.473 --> 55:29.649
We were so close to it.

55:32.423 --> 55:34.646
I still plan to take you to Brocheet.

55:35.531 --> 55:36.521
- Brocheet.

55:36.563 --> 55:41.516
- Listen, I know Kameens and Lokkeins never got along,

55:42.473 --> 55:47.381
but Brocheet was honorable-ish

55:47.423 --> 55:48.356
at his end.

55:49.523 --> 55:52.601
I truly believe he wanted
to put everything behind us

55:52.643 --> 55:53.815
to work together.

55:58.733 --> 56:01.931
You can stay here and live with us.

56:01.973 --> 56:04.855
We have nothing against the Peesh.

56:09.293 --> 56:10.143
I'm sorry, Giree.

56:11.873 --> 56:13.436
I know you loved Brocheet.

56:14.547 --> 56:15.942
He was good to you.

56:18.513 --> 56:19.946
Let's get some rest.

56:21.025 --> 56:21.942
We need it.

56:23.117 --> 56:26.023
And then I'll take you to Brocheet.

56:26.898 --> 56:29.565
We can give him a proper burial.

56:50.742 --> 56:51.659
- Brocheet.

57:29.012 --> 57:31.179
- That's definitely Giree.

57:32.471 --> 57:35.306
She's healed someone recently.

57:41.850 --> 57:44.433
Lock!

57:47.439 --> 57:51.882
She'll be the last Lokkein to ever take a Kameen name!

58:12.408 --> 58:13.241
Giree.

58:15.567 --> 58:16.400
Giree!

58:17.937 --> 58:19.237
Brocheet?

58:19.279 --> 58:21.880
Come.

58:21.922 --> 58:24.592
Oh, Giree.

58:24.634 --> 58:25.717
I missed you.

58:26.954 --> 58:30.111
Thank Chokk I found you.

58:37.140 --> 58:40.017
I'm gonna need your healing soon,

58:40.059 --> 58:41.059
but not yet.

58:43.079 --> 58:45.030
Has she found the vial?

58:50.562 --> 58:52.145
Good, let's get it.

59:09.325 --> 59:11.075
Rise and shine, Lock!

59:13.194 --> 59:14.111
- Brocheet!

59:15.053 --> 59:16.076
You're alive!

59:17.376 --> 59:19.193
- I want the vial!

59:20.770 --> 59:23.291
- Giree, I thought he was dead.

59:23.333 --> 59:26.382
Please, I checked his heartbeat, I swear to you!

59:26.424 --> 59:29.648
- Back off! Give me the vial now!

59:29.690 --> 59:31.584
- You can't have it yet!

59:42.040 --> 59:43.901
- Give me one good reason

59:43.943 --> 59:46.403
why I shouldn't kill you right now!

59:50.298 --> 59:53.983
I thought you were dead!

59:55.968 --> 59:59.064
I checked your heartbeat

59:59.106 --> 01:00:00.606
and heard nothing,

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:05.606
so I went and got the vial.

01:00:07.703 --> 01:00:10.168
We were on our way to bury you.

01:00:11.596 --> 01:00:16.571
- Kameen don't have hearts, you ignorant Zahd digger!

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:20.381
Our blood replicates itself and our veins expand

01:00:20.423 --> 01:00:23.891
and contract to pump blood through our bodies.

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:27.314
- Spare the anatomy lesson, Brocheet.

01:00:30.407 --> 01:00:31.421
Okay.

01:00:31.463 --> 01:00:33.823
- Give me the vial.

01:00:33.865 --> 01:00:35.448
- I'm on your team.

01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:38.115
- Show it to me now!

01:00:45.144 --> 01:00:48.491
Seems Giree's taken a liking to you.

01:00:48.533 --> 01:00:51.616
She rescued me back there.

01:00:54.027 --> 01:00:58.253
If I give you the vial, promise
she'll heal my husband too.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.441
It's either her or the vial,

01:01:02.483 --> 01:01:05.522
but I need one of them to help him.

01:01:07.733 --> 01:01:11.591
- Giree says she will try to heal your husband,

01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:14.276
but give me the vial first.

01:01:17.456 --> 01:01:18.056
Now.

01:01:27.173 --> 01:01:28.777
That's it?

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:29.652
Huh?

01:01:32.363 --> 01:01:37.226
- Now it's your turn to hold up your end of the bargain.

01:01:40.223 --> 01:01:42.926
- You only get one Peesh healing.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.636
- Generous.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:49.830
- Lead the way.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.862
Here.

01:02:27.946 --> 01:02:29.121
Come.

01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:35.814
Giree.

01:03:29.666 --> 01:03:31.718
Yeah.

01:04:19.694 --> 01:04:22.111
- I'll see you soon, my love.

01:04:26.606 --> 01:04:27.731
Thank you.

01:04:51.776 --> 01:04:52.859
It's working!

01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:56.988
Wake up, Kaak!

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:57.863
Kaak!

01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:02.439
Come back to me, Kaak. You can do this.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:03.878
You can do this, Kaak.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.946
- I'm sorry.

01:05:05.843 --> 01:05:10.619
As I said, sometimes they are too far gone.

01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:15.296
Did you see that? He just moved.

01:05:17.633 --> 01:05:20.396
Kaak, Kaak, can you hear me?

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:23.001
Kaak!

01:05:23.043 --> 01:05:24.953
Kaak!

01:05:24.995 --> 01:05:25.828
Kaak! Lock?

01:05:27.373 --> 01:05:29.786
- Kaak, you're alive.

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:32.777
Giree brought you back to life.

01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:35.476
- Giree?

01:05:36.939 --> 01:05:37.772
A Peesh?

01:05:39.533 --> 01:05:41.275
What are we, on Kameen?

01:05:41.317 --> 01:05:44.464
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's Brocheet and Giree.

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:46.991
They're not a threat.

01:05:47.033 --> 01:05:50.186
We're still on Rockachie. We have the vial.

01:05:51.023 --> 01:05:51.856
Well,

01:05:54.129 --> 01:05:55.819
they have the vial.

01:05:55.861 --> 01:05:59.683
Huh?

01:05:59.725 --> 01:06:03.341
No! You will not do this to my people again!

01:06:03.383 --> 01:06:04.656
Give me that vial! - Kaak!

01:06:22.613 --> 01:06:26.471
Wait! I traded the vial for your life.

01:06:26.513 --> 01:06:27.905
- You did?

01:06:31.936 --> 01:06:32.769
- She did.

01:06:38.243 --> 01:06:40.195
You owe me, Lokkein.

01:06:45.633 --> 01:06:47.793
- Enjoy your water, Kameen.

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:50.133
I will

01:06:53.993 --> 01:06:58.993
Lock, you are stronger than
I give your species credit for.

01:07:06.353 --> 01:07:10.263
Perhaps in another life, we could have been friends.

01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:15.260
- Friends wouldn't treat each other this way, Brocheet.

01:07:21.293 --> 01:07:25.286
- Come on, Giree, let's get off this planet,

01:07:26.393 --> 01:07:28.385
go save Kameen.

01:07:45.503 --> 01:07:46.403
- Goodbye, friend.

01:08:13.854 --> 01:08:17.770
Brocheet!

01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:24.731
- Still have enough energy to take care of my arm

01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:26.087
when we get back to the ship?

01:08:27.889 --> 01:08:29.644
He's back! Look out, Kaak!

01:08:32.224 --> 01:08:35.220
No, no, no! No!

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.799
- Chokk dammit.

01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:23.036
- Hey, ugly!

01:10:30.288 --> 01:10:31.121
Thanks,

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.806
friend.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.491
- You're welcome.

01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:43.241
- I will not let the Kameens
take what little water we have.

01:10:43.283 --> 01:10:46.986
You take everything from us, but not anymore!

01:10:47.028 --> 01:10:48.875
No! No!

01:10:48.917 --> 01:10:50.516
- No! No!

01:10:51.477 --> 01:10:53.531
- Wait! - Wait for what?

01:10:53.573 --> 01:10:56.231
Were you really gonna give this to the Kameens,

01:10:56.273 --> 01:10:58.412
the same Kameens that killed me nonetheless?

01:11:00.233 --> 01:11:02.711
No, but the fire will rejuvenate

01:11:02.753 --> 01:11:05.471
everything on the planet,

01:11:05.513 --> 01:11:07.241
not just the water!

01:11:07.283 --> 01:11:10.211
- The very little life on this planet will adjust,

01:11:10.253 --> 01:11:12.551
and it's better than drinking nothing but Zahd,

01:11:12.593 --> 01:11:13.817
and letting all the...

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:18.331
letting all the Kameens have all the water!

01:11:19.594 --> 01:11:21.844
- Kaak, what have you done?

01:11:31.256 --> 01:11:33.835
Huh? - No!

01:11:45.195 --> 01:11:46.028
No!

01:11:47.364 --> 01:11:48.197
No!

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:00.831
- Stay back!

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:10.397
Brocheet!

01:12:15.507 --> 01:12:17.046
- Giree, run!

01:12:23.107 --> 01:12:24.166
Brocheet!

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:48.002
- Brocheet, are you there?

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.646
If you can hear us, we need the vial now.

01:13:53.867 --> 01:13:56.801
Kameen's completely out of water.

01:13:56.843 --> 01:13:59.546
Our people are dying rapidly.

01:14:00.413 --> 01:14:02.300
Please, Brocheet,

01:14:03.724 --> 01:14:04.886
in a few days,

01:14:06.353 --> 01:14:07.646
we'll all be gone.

01:14:09.869 --> 01:14:14.869
Please, Brocheet,

01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:16.642
come home now!

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:25.726
This civilization

01:14:27.315 --> 01:14:28.982
is depending on you.

01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:32.249
Please,

01:14:36.307 --> 01:14:38.924
come...
