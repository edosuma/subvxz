WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.370
My name is Brian Finch.

00:02.403 --> 00:05.206
I was your average
28-year-old screwup

00:05.239 --> 00:07.708
until I took a pill called NZT.

00:07.741 --> 00:11.079
Suddenly I had access
to every brain cell.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.181
Every time he takes it,
for the next 12 hours,

00:13.214 --> 00:14.615
he basically becomes the
smartest person in the world.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.749
BRIAN: And that's why
the FBI hired me.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.518
My name's Brian Finch,

00:17.551 --> 00:18.652
this is Rebecca Harris,
and we're with the FBI.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.321
God, that sounds cool.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.090
There's just one problem.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.491
NZT will kill you,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.593
unless you have this shot.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.062
Now you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.363
Why would you help me?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.465
Let's just say I need somebody
in your position.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.401
If you describe
to the FBI or anyone

00:33.434 --> 00:34.268
about these shots...

00:34.302 --> 00:35.803
I will let you die
more painfully

00:35.836 --> 00:37.605
and slowly than you can fathom.

00:37.638 --> 00:41.342
So, Brian, you ready
to become somebody who matters?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.477
Previously on Limitless...

00:43.511 --> 00:46.080
I think my father was
on NZT that night.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.249
My name's Sands.
I'm your new boss.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.285
You belong to
Mr. Morra now.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.254
Brian?
Shauna!

00:54.655 --> 00:57.625
There are things about my life
that I can't tell you about.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.561
SANDS: There is no one
you call family or friends

01:00.594 --> 01:02.230
who I can't touch.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.764
Brian?

01:03.797 --> 01:06.100
Brian?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.702
BRIAN:
Had to, uh, break off...

01:08.736 --> 01:10.638
things with Shauna.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.440
She didn't take it very well.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.642
I think I hurt her
pretty bad.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.677
(dance music blaring,
partiers chattering)

01:21.282 --> 01:23.251
BRIAN:
Now, in a certain light,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.586
this all looks
pretty glamorous.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.256
But when you're walking up
to a place like this on NZT,

01:28.289 --> 01:31.259
everything looks different.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.461
Almost everyone in this line,
me included,

01:33.494 --> 01:36.697
has a hole to fill;
a void.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.200
I lost Shauna.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.634
I can't be with anyone.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.673
(unlatching velvet rope)

01:45.706 --> 01:47.741
Am I proud of what I do
to fill that void?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.743
No.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.414
But I mean, come on...
I'm not St. Brian.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.619
But honestly,

01:58.652 --> 02:01.355
when NZT turns hooking up
into an algorithm,

02:01.389 --> 02:02.790
the fun wears off...

02:02.823 --> 02:04.425
and a meaningless
one-night stand

02:04.458 --> 02:07.495
is ultimately...
meaningless.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.397
Who knew?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.499
Your mind starts to crave more.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.167
So, I poked around.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.835
I started
e-mailing back and forth

02:14.868 --> 02:16.670
with some
very interesting people.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.772
There's Nina, who has some
truly fascinating ideas

02:18.806 --> 02:20.708
about why quantum particles
change form

02:20.741 --> 02:22.543
when someone observes them.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.412
Then there's John.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.813
He's working on a drug

02:25.846 --> 02:28.416
that alters the way
we all perceive time.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.184
I mean, if you could
make ten minutes

02:30.218 --> 02:32.353
feel like an entire day,

02:32.386 --> 02:34.555
what would you do
with the extra hours?

02:37.325 --> 02:40.294
Oh! And Arthur-- he claims
he's one breakthrough away

02:40.328 --> 02:42.530
from being able
to double a mouse's lifespan

02:42.563 --> 02:44.332
by mutating its genes.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.700
The limits of what we know--

02:46.734 --> 02:48.569
that's something
you can get lost in.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.506
That's a way to take your mind
off a broken heart.

02:55.243 --> 02:58.512
(sighs)
Good morning, everyone.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.683
Take a seat, Finch.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.995
I've decided...

03:15.028 --> 03:18.699
to read you into your first
confidential case.

03:18.732 --> 03:22.570
You will be given a temporary
top secret clearance.

03:22.603 --> 03:26.940
Okay, just out of curiosity,
is that the highest

03:26.974 --> 03:29.643
there is?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.645
Am I higher than Boyle?

03:31.679 --> 03:32.913
NAZ:
You will have access

03:32.946 --> 03:35.483
to knowledge that,
if applied improperly,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.585
would leave you vulnerable
to charges

03:37.618 --> 03:40.688
of treason.
Mm.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.291
You know, I need to know
that you understand this

03:43.324 --> 03:45.025
and take it seriously,
and that T-shirt isn't helping.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.961
Uh, well,
I'll tell you this much.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.997
I don't want to go to jail,

03:50.030 --> 03:53.000
so... I'm good.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.302
Look, I appreciate
the show of confidence.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.036
All right, seriously.
What's up?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.905
REBECCA:
Our intelligence

03:57.938 --> 04:00.908
branch is building a case
against a man named Mao Zhang.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.476
He's a Chinese immigrant,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.812
and he's a top engineer
at Miller-Bluett Technologies,

04:04.845 --> 04:07.815
a very important
defense contractor.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.882
Zhang has access

04:08.916 --> 04:11.919
to specs for all kinds
of drones, cloaking tech.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.288
This is sensitive
technology.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.690
A few months back, the CIA
intercepted a Chinese drone that

04:16.724 --> 04:17.791
was fitted

04:17.825 --> 04:19.026
with Miller-Bluett's specs.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.629
Our people zeroed in

04:21.662 --> 04:22.996
on Zhang,
but they haven't been able

04:23.030 --> 04:25.065
to find hard evidence
he's been selling intel.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
They want our help.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.637
Ooh. Okay, I got it.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.839
Please don't spill coffee

04:31.872 --> 04:33.307
on the top secret file.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.947
Spy stuff.
This is so bad-ass,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.782
guys. All right.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.984
Where do you want me to start?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.422
Okay.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.957
You want me to dig
through his garbage?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.059
It's an important part
of counterespionage.
(flies buzzing)

04:52.092 --> 04:53.794
We've been collecting
Zhang's garbage

04:53.827 --> 04:55.729
from the city for
over a month now.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.798
You won't be the first
to go through it,

04:57.831 --> 05:00.401
but you'll be the first
to go through it on NZT.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.370
You're not on litter duty,
though?
Surveillance.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.072
Congratulations on
your new clearance.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.475
(flies buzzing)

05:15.616 --> 05:17.618
BRIAN: Once you get over
the ick factor,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.453
you can actually learn a lot
about someone

05:19.487 --> 05:21.321
by what they throw away.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.694
Zhang might be
an amazing engineer,

05:26.727 --> 05:28.396
but he's vain about going gray.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.541
He's got a gleaming
white smile.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.414
And even though
he's lactose intolerant,

05:46.447 --> 05:48.015
he consumes organic milk
by the bucket-load.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.583
Which is weird, right?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.965
Every carton of milk
Zhang threw away

06:04.998 --> 06:07.067
has those scratches
down the side.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.075
They're combinations
of numbers...

06:15.108 --> 06:16.877
and when you put them together
in the right combination,

06:16.910 --> 06:18.912
they add up to measurements.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.604
He's passing schematics
for some kind of drone.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.139
You just drew this blueprint?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.542
It's only partial,
but if we've been

06:48.576 --> 06:51.078
taking his garbage, the people
he's giving these specs to

06:51.111 --> 06:52.713
haven't been getting
new information.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.682
Odds are they know
he's being watched,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.684
and they've changed up
the delivery method.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.185
This isn't enough
to make an arrest.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.087
There's no evidence
of sale or exchange.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.222
But it's more than enough
to get a warrant

07:02.255 --> 07:04.091
for a covert search
of Zhang's place.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.226
And we're basically positive
he's a spy.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.061
This is huge, Brian.
Finch.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.630
(phone chimes)

07:10.764 --> 07:12.833
Huh.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.835
It's this guy Arthur
I've been talking to.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.205
He thinks I helped him
create an immortal mouse.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.844
MAN:
Tithonus.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.247
Isn't he beautiful?

07:27.280 --> 07:31.485
The adjustments you gave me--
they were brilliant.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.120
How long have you been working
with telomeres?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.088
Uh, I don't work
with telomeres.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.558
I just kind of took a
shot in the dark, I guess.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.893
Do you understand
what you've done?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.228
Telomeres hold our genes
together.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.863
Every time

07:42.896 --> 07:44.665
our bodies produce cells,
they wear down.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.899
Eventually, so do we.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.936
For now, anyway.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.739
I gave this mouse a gene therapy
based on your input,

07:51.772 --> 07:54.775
and if I'm right, he's going
to live up to two months longer.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.011
Cool.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.780
Two months-- is
that a big deal?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.248
That is an entire standard

08:01.281 --> 08:02.816
deviation.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.952
If we could apply this therapy
to humans,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.820
we could expect to live another

08:06.854 --> 08:08.288
20 to 30 years.
Think about that.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.658
You made it possible.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.860
Although I do have to say--

08:12.893 --> 08:15.996
you're different
than I expected you to be.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.566
Your e-mails are always...
so articulate.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.769
Yeah, uh, just kind of depends
on the time of day.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.037
You see, if we do apply
this therapy to humans...

08:24.071 --> 08:27.207
BRIAN: Was he a genius,
or just a crazy guy in Queens?

08:27.240 --> 08:30.010
Off NZT, it's really
hard for me to tell.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.579
I'd like to think
he's a genius.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.880
ARTHUR: ...other biological
problems occur.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.089
(siren wails in distance)

08:47.895 --> 08:50.063
SANDS: Did you know
your flat was bugged?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.709
How did you get in here?

09:03.243 --> 09:05.145
Tech's four years old,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.915
so you can give the FBI
the benefit of the doubt

09:07.948 --> 09:11.819
and assume it was installed
for a prior resident.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.286
What do you want, Sands?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.089
Sit.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.965
It's time
to make yourself useful.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.235
We know quite a lot about
N-Zed-T our side of the fence.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.270
FBI's playing catch-up.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.641
We're curious
how that's working for them.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.076
I want you to find out
exactly what they know,

09:36.109 --> 09:37.911
and bring it to me.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.813
This for you,
or for Senator Morra?

09:39.847 --> 09:42.382
That's not a distinction
you need concern yourself with.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.717
Why does he need to know this?

09:43.751 --> 09:46.720
Brian, you're asking questions.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.656
No.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.923
This is a bad idea.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.324
We should wait.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.662
They're just starting
to trust me.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.731
When Mr. Morra
gave you that shot

09:57.765 --> 09:59.933
to make you immune
to the side effects of the pill,

09:59.967 --> 10:03.403
he told you it comes
with an expiration date.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.673
You're gonna need a booster.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.107
Shortly.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.109
Or...

10:09.142 --> 10:12.245
your life's gonna take
a nasty turn.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.147
Brain damage,
blackouts,

10:14.181 --> 10:16.349
psychosis.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.421
When you bring me those files--
all of them--

10:21.454 --> 10:24.024
then and only then

10:24.057 --> 10:26.126
will you get your next shot.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.234
Your liquor cabinet's

10:34.267 --> 10:35.335
crap, mate.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.004
(glass clunks on table)

10:37.037 --> 10:39.639
Sort it out.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.644
You've got three days.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.084
(door closes)

11:15.442 --> 11:17.845
BRIAN: So Sands wants me to
get the NZT files--

11:17.878 --> 11:19.947
that are locked in a safe
in Naz's office.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.983
I mean, come on.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.853
Hey.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.720
Hey.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.287
You okay?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.789
Yeah. Of course. Why?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.223
You're just kind
of standing here.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.324
I just came
through Security.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.360
There's someone here to see you
named Arthur Maciel.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.263
Seems kind of agitated.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.298
Huh.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.377
(panting)

11:50.410 --> 11:52.279
He's gone. Tithonus is gone.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.513
Your mouse?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.348
(groans)
He's gone.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.085
Somebody broke
into my place last night.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.353
And I think they tried
to get into my computers,

12:00.387 --> 12:04.357
but the security's too tight.
So, I don't know, they took him.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.093
Okay. Well, you've got
your notes, right?

12:06.126 --> 12:09.162
Just make another one.
(sighs)
That's not the point.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.364
If the people who stole him
know what they're doing,

12:11.398 --> 12:14.301
they can reverse-engineer
my work.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.169
The gene therapy inside
that animal is worth

12:16.203 --> 12:17.938
hundreds of millions
of dollars.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.173
Maybe billions.
Wow.

12:20.207 --> 12:24.812
And now he has it.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.246
"He"?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.515
A long time ago,
I had a-a business partner,

12:28.548 --> 12:29.549
Paul Wilkerman.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.184
We started a
biotech company

12:31.218 --> 12:32.385
called Claxion together.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.288
You cofounded Claxion?

12:35.322 --> 12:38.191
Yeah, it was in a garage
back then, but yeah.

12:38.225 --> 12:41.494
Our visions didn't align,
so he bought me out.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.497
For...
(clears throat) $19,000.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.034
You see, Paul,

12:47.067 --> 12:50.037
over the years, he's been...

12:50.070 --> 12:53.040
(wry laugh)
less than gracious

12:53.073 --> 12:56.109
about my original contributions
to Claxion.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.346
So after
this breakthrough, I...

12:59.379 --> 13:03.583
I wrote him an open letter and
posted it on a message board.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.954
I may have boasted
a little bit.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.521
Arthur... (scoffs)

13:08.555 --> 13:12.059
if you posted about your
breakthrough on a message board,

13:12.092 --> 13:14.194
anyone could have read that,
man.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.230
Yeah, maybe.
But who could move so fast?

13:17.264 --> 13:18.832
You see,

13:18.866 --> 13:22.235
he's built his career
on the original sin

13:22.269 --> 13:25.505
of convincing the world that
I am not to be taken seriously.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.374
(knocking)
Yeah.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.511
Okay, look, I gotta
go right now, but, um,

13:31.544 --> 13:34.047
I'll look into it.
This is...

13:34.081 --> 13:37.317
it's my life's work.

13:37.350 --> 13:41.521
Don't let him take that from me.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.523
All right. All right.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.225
I'll look into it.

13:46.026 --> 13:46.994
(groans)

13:47.027 --> 13:48.228
Let's get researchin'.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.101
The FBI put me on finding
avenues to nail Zhang,

13:54.134 --> 13:56.469
but I couldn't help thinking
about Arthur.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.873
You're procrastinating.
Believe me, I've been there.

13:59.907 --> 14:03.143
Sands gave me three days
to dig up some files.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.312
If I were you--
and I pretty much am--

14:05.345 --> 14:07.881
I'd be figuring out
how to get inside that safe.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.382
Naz is the Special Agent
in Charge

14:09.416 --> 14:12.252
of the Cross Jurisdictional
Command, all right?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.921
I can't just break
into her office.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.056
It's treason. They throw
you in supermax prison

14:16.089 --> 14:17.891
for that.
And what about Rebecca?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.092
She stuck her neck out for me

14:19.126 --> 14:20.928
to get this job.
What happens to her

14:20.961 --> 14:23.030
if I get caught stealing
national secrets?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.065
So don't get caught.
Because as bad

14:25.098 --> 14:26.967
as you think this option
might be,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.201
I assure you...

14:29.937 --> 14:31.171
...the other one is way worse.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.174
But you can get into that safe.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.443
It's possible
to make fake fingerprints.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.444
Remember?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.278
You're gonna want to press

14:38.311 --> 14:40.447
the silicone
into the pane of glass

14:40.480 --> 14:43.050
with your index finger...
Aah! Boom. Told you.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.517
You owe me 50 bucks.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.153
You need to make
a shopping list.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.522
Cyanoacrylate, molds, gel.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.424
Mike and Ike don't follow me
when I'm not on the pill.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.392
I'll go tonight.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.061
Now all you need
is your boss's fingerprints

14:54.094 --> 14:55.162
and you got it.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.099
She's always drinking green tea.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.234
(toy squeaks)

15:04.404 --> 15:06.539
NAZ: So you're the one
stealing my tea.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.541
It's fine, Brian.
The government pays for it.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.111
It's for everyone.
I'm just surprised.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.246
You don't seem like one
for healthy habits.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.347
Oh, what, are you kidding me?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.283
I'm gonna live forever
with this stuff.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.088
MAN:
Ma'am. They're back
from the break-in

15:21.121 --> 15:22.455
at Mao Zhang's.
Ah.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.504
REBECCA:
Tactical just got back

15:37.537 --> 15:38.371
from searching
Zhang's home.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.440
Anything promising?
It's hard to say.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.542
All the documents we
photographed are in Chinese.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.545
We've got his hard drives.
Scans of everything in his safe.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.547
If there was something
compromising in Zhang's house,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.549
we got it.
We're heading down
to Forensics now.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.552
We'll organize
everything we pulled.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.655
You will have plenty of stuff
to go through in the morning.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.659
(sighs)

15:59.692 --> 16:02.395
(horn honking, siren wailing
in distance)

16:02.429 --> 16:04.431
WOMAN:
Ms. Harris.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.135
I'm sorry for the ambush.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.003
My name is Beth Gunther.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.538
I was just leaving you a note.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.541
I was your father's dealer.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.409
I-I beg your pardon?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.411
(sighs)
Sorry.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.113
I sold his paintings.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.417
As far as I knew,
my father stopped painting

16:24.451 --> 16:26.086
after he lost his job at UNC.

16:26.119 --> 16:30.523
I didn't realize
he was still working until he...

16:30.557 --> 16:32.259
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.127
Conrad was
renting a studio

16:34.161 --> 16:35.662
in Bushwick. Given his history,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.697
he needed me
to cosign the lease.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.233
The landlord touched base
with me a while back.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.668
He was cleaning the place out,

16:41.701 --> 16:44.037
and he found
three finished canvases.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.573
They pass on to
you, of course.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.042
I'm having a show next week.
I could sell them if you want.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.678
But, really,
I thought you might want them.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.349
You don't have to tell me now.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.221
Thank you for
stopping by, but...

17:01.254 --> 17:03.223
you can sell the paintings.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.092
Are you sure?

17:05.125 --> 17:06.759
If my father wanted me
to know about his art,

17:06.793 --> 17:08.528
then he would have told me.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.565
In case you change your mind.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.742
Wake up.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.345
(groans)
Ike.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.081
Not my name.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.283
Come on. Agent Harris wants
you in Riverside Park.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.818
Hey, I got a question for you.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.821
How do you and Mike decide
who comes over here?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.823
Do you play
rock-paper-scissors?

17:36.856 --> 17:40.227
Get up.
Let's move.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.095
REBECCA:
I got in this morning,

17:42.129 --> 17:43.630
and I saw the NYPD
had put out a BOLO

17:43.663 --> 17:45.198
for a name
that sounded familiar.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.233
Earlier this morning,

17:46.266 --> 17:48.335
a man named Paul Wilkerman
was running in the park

17:48.368 --> 17:50.870
when someone stabbed him
to death.
Paul Wilkerman?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.706
Chairman and CEO
of Claxion. NYPD found prints

17:53.740 --> 17:56.243
at the scene. They're pretty
sure they belong to the killer.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.377
They match a man named

17:57.410 --> 17:59.646
Arthur Maciel.
What?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.381
They arrested him
an hour ago,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.650
and a detective said
he's asking for you.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.652
I don't know what Arthur
was so upset about

18:05.685 --> 18:08.121
when he came to see you
yesterday, but this morning,

18:08.155 --> 18:10.423
it looks like
he murdered Wilkerman.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.168
I didn't do this.
You have to believe me.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.803
They found your fingerprints
on Paul Wilkerman's corpse.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.572
They can fake those.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.674
I've been set up.
This whole thing,

18:27.707 --> 18:31.378
it's a trap designed
by someone very, very clever.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.313
Lay out the steps.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.714
Steal the mouse
to give me motive.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.350
Get rid of Paul and then put
my fingerprints there.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.022
Please.

18:43.055 --> 18:47.894
I don't have any money to
hire an expensive attorney.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.463
The one they sent over,

18:50.497 --> 18:52.732
she already told me
to take a plea.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.800
I don't know, Arthur.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.236
Maybe you should listen to her.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.573
I've spent the last 25 years
of my life

19:00.607 --> 19:02.575
working without...

19:02.609 --> 19:04.311
without credit

19:04.344 --> 19:06.313
or even that much money.

19:06.346 --> 19:10.317
The only goal I had

19:10.350 --> 19:13.886
was to help people.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.290
If you want... want to know

19:17.324 --> 19:18.791
who killed Paul Wilkerman...

19:20.427 --> 19:21.661
...find the mouse.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.930
Find...

19:23.963 --> 19:25.665
Tithonus.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.305
BRIAN:
Hey.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.506
Yeah.

19:33.540 --> 19:38.578
What if Arthur
Maciel is innocent?

19:38.611 --> 19:39.979
Do you have reason to believe
he's innocent?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.382
He came to the FBI
looking for help.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.784
Then he killed the guy
less than 24 hours later?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.719
It's just weird. And, plus,

19:46.753 --> 19:48.588
he doesn't seem
like a murderer to me.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.423
Well, in that case, I guess
I would have to tell you

19:50.457 --> 19:52.792
that the murder
of Paul Wilkerman is an NYPD

19:52.825 --> 19:54.427
investigation.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.264
And the FBI shouldn't have
an opinion one way or the other.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.831
Okay. Good talk.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.302
However...

20:02.335 --> 20:04.404
last night, our translators
figured out

20:04.437 --> 20:06.273
that Mao Zhang
has been corresponding

20:06.306 --> 20:08.708
with a high-level
Chinese operative named Lin.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.343
Now, there's
a Kevin Lin

20:10.377 --> 20:12.545
who grew up one town away
from Zhang.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.614
He has a degree
in aerospace engineering,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.549
he served
in the Chinese military,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.718
and he moved to New York
six years ago.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.821
So you think
he's Zhang's handler?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.956
He could be. Boyle and I
are gonna be all over it.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.958
But the Bureau thinks
there's an off-chance

20:25.992 --> 20:28.828
that Kevin Lin isn't the Lin
we're looking for.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.698
They want you to comb through
all of the Lins

20:31.731 --> 20:33.500
in the tristate area.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.701
How many Lins are there?

20:34.734 --> 20:35.868
A little under 40,000.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.339
Now, you can do that, or...

20:39.372 --> 20:40.873
I have contacts at NYPD.
I could have them

20:40.907 --> 20:43.710
send over whatever they have
on Paul Wilkerman's murder.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.878
Seriously?

20:45.912 --> 20:49.282
You're telling me to blow off
the work the FBI gave me?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.817
I'm telling you to prioritize.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.320
On one hand,
40,000 people named Lin.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.654
On the other,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.022
someone who's been accused
of a murder

20:56.055 --> 20:57.457
you think he didn't commit.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.492
Okay.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.843
BRIAN:
I ignored the files on Mao
for a couple of hours

21:16.876 --> 21:19.312
and decided to look
at the NYPD stuff.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.781
Arthur's fingerprints
were all over the scene

21:21.814 --> 21:23.783
of Paul Wilkerman's murder,

21:23.816 --> 21:25.718
but someone else's DNA
was there, too.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.421
Paul scratched his attacker.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.789
There was dried blood
under his fingernails,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.658
and it wasn't Arthur's.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.994
And t didn't match anyone
from the ViCAP database.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.463
Whatever that is.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.069
That scrap of paper
from Paul's wallet,

21:43.102 --> 21:44.371
there's blue ink under there.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.672
Why'd he cross it out?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.377
Username: wilkermanp
and a bunch of numbers.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.780
Password: sandcastle92,
with two "at" signs.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.782
Why did Paul Wilkerman have
an e-mail account

21:55.815 --> 21:57.417
he didn't want anyone
to know about?

21:57.450 --> 22:00.353
So, you know
about Paul Wilkerman already.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.389
He's very accomplished,
very rich.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.391
If you're looking for people
who might have killed him,

22:04.424 --> 22:05.658
the natural place to start

22:05.692 --> 22:07.026
is with the people who stood

22:07.059 --> 22:08.528
to inherit all that money,
right?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.863
Well, that turned out to be
a total bust,

22:10.897 --> 22:12.699
because six months ago,

22:12.732 --> 22:15.802
Paul Wilkerman wrote an op-ed
saying he no longer believes

22:15.835 --> 22:17.570
in the concept
of inherited wealth.

22:17.604 --> 22:21.508
He pledged his entire fortune
to five different charities, so,

22:21.541 --> 22:23.142
that's a no-go.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.646
But Paul Wilkerman kept
the details of a non-Claxion

22:26.679 --> 22:28.080
e-mail account
in his wallet.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.816
I checked the user name
and password

22:29.849 --> 22:30.983
against common domain names.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.819
Soon enough, I was in.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.121
Now, Wilkerman used that account
to write back and forth

22:35.154 --> 22:36.689
with a man named Alan Carverton.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.991
He's the Executive Director
of Research at Claxion.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.560
He used a non-work account

22:40.593 --> 22:42.929
to communicate
with his own executive?
Mm-hmm.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.697
Weird, right?
And after Arthur

22:44.731 --> 22:46.799
posted his big
breakthrough online,

22:46.833 --> 22:49.035
Paul Wilkerman and
Alan Carverton sent

22:49.068 --> 22:51.738
27 e-mails back
and forth to each other.

22:51.771 --> 22:52.805
I mean, Wilkerman wanted to know

22:52.839 --> 22:54.941
why his head of research
was so far behind Arthur.

22:54.974 --> 22:59.045
So, you think this guy Carverton
stole the mouse,

22:59.078 --> 23:02.114
killed Wilkerman,
and then framed Arthur?

23:02.148 --> 23:04.684
Congratulations.
You've got yourself a suspect.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.053
What are you
gonna do about it?

23:07.086 --> 23:08.588
I don't know.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.524
Um, Mike and Ike supervise me
while I'm on NZT.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.493
That sounds really daunting.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.495
You're telling me
to ditch these guys.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.163
(laughing):
What is with you?

23:17.196 --> 23:19.466
If Maciel's innocent, I don't
want to see him going away

23:19.499 --> 23:20.800
for murder any more
than you do.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.435
As long as you're here
when I need you,

23:22.469 --> 23:25.505
and you're not hurting anyone,
then, I've got your back.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.507
Thanks.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.775
Uh, one quick question

23:28.808 --> 23:30.076
before you go.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.911
Who is Beth Gunther?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.115
Your dad made that?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.050
I helped him mix the paint.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.653
I think it's my favorite thing
he ever did.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.655
Wow.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.056
He was really good.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.058
Yeah, he always was.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.227
Even after
he started shooting up

23:48.260 --> 23:50.096
in our bathroom every morning.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.767
I hate what he did,
and I hate that

23:54.801 --> 23:56.603
he died because of it, but

23:56.636 --> 23:58.905
what happened to him is not
going to define me.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.173
But you kept that business card.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.209
I did.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.682
I think my father was taking NZT
before he got killed, so...

24:09.716 --> 24:13.052
if he was finally
painting again, that's why.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.121
And I shouldn't care.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.657
Did you ever tell the people
here that he was using NZT?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.659
Based on what?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.661
That he had a glimmer
in his eyes?

24:21.694 --> 24:24.631
I don't know.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.767
If my dad was gone...

24:27.800 --> 24:30.537
and I learned there was
something out there he had made,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.572
I don't think
I could ignore it.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.878
So if Alan Carverton killed
Paul Wilkerman,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.013
that means he has
Arthur's mouse.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.550
Which means it's in the labs
at Claxion.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.218
And if I'm going to get there,
I've got to ditch...

24:46.252 --> 24:48.955
Mike and Ike.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.991
Mike-- four years
defensive line at Illinois.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.960
Possible Special Forces-type
killing machine.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.728
Real name: unknown.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.964
Ike-- two tours of duty
in Afghanistan.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.298
Good with knives. Maybe.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.901
Real name-- heard it once,
don't remember.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.570
(whistle)
Sorry to interrupt.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.905
Have you maybe gone maybe
a little nuts?

25:05.938 --> 25:09.175
Naz is leaving her office,
right now, as we speak.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.244
The clock is running.
You do not have enough room

25:12.278 --> 25:15.114
on your to-do list
to help Arthur Maciel.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.749
There are still two days left.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.919
And besides, Rebecca just,
you know, confided in me.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.755
I can't steal files from
her boss's office right now.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.724
So, it'll be easier
to betray her later then?

25:24.757 --> 25:26.626
I don't...
I'll figure something out, okay?

25:26.659 --> 25:27.794
Now are you gonna help,

25:27.827 --> 25:30.062
or are you gonna sit there
and be annoying?

25:30.096 --> 25:31.731
Look, if you just want
to get past Mike and Ike,

25:31.764 --> 25:33.032
it's not that hard.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.902
Just leave your phone behind
when you get in the elevator.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.104
Shoot! Forgot my phone!

25:40.673 --> 25:42.909
Take the stairs,
and you're out.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.912
Get your hands on a Claxion
I.D., and you're in.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.080
Hey, buddy, I'm selling
Girl Scout cookies for my niece.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.582
Just trying to raise enough
money to buy a pony.
Sorry.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.717
We don't need.
We don't need, okay?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.218
Can I put you down
for a couple boxes? No?

25:54.921 --> 25:55.922
(beep)

25:58.290 --> 26:00.192
(whistles)

26:00.226 --> 26:02.128
(whispers):
Lost and found.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.564
(mice squeaking)

26:16.308 --> 26:20.346
Okay, so, Tithonus,
the maybe-immortal mouse...

26:20.379 --> 26:23.049
He's brindle,
so he should stand out.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.986
(quietly):
You guys seen a brown mouse,

26:27.019 --> 26:28.287
but... maybe...

26:28.320 --> 26:30.289
He's not here.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.626
Hey.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.327
What are you doing in here?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.764
Uh, Bruce from upstairs
wanted to make sure

26:37.797 --> 26:40.066
we didn't leave the, uh,
aerosol nebulizer on

26:40.099 --> 26:41.701
in the induction chamber.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.210
(alarm sounding)

26:51.243 --> 26:52.712
Oh, not cool!

26:58.184 --> 26:59.719
(alarm sounding)
WOMAN (over P.A.): Security
has been breached.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.722
Take necessary steps
to secure priority data,

27:02.755 --> 27:04.991
labs and materials.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.894
Attention: security
has been breached.

27:07.927 --> 27:08.995
(elevator bell chimes,
man talking)

27:09.028 --> 27:11.030
...to protect
your priority data...

27:21.741 --> 27:25.144
BOYLE:
Ah, that's it.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.179
That's the dead drop.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.850
If Kevin Lin is
really Mao's contact

27:30.883 --> 27:31.684
in the Chinese government,

27:31.718 --> 27:33.152
he's gonna be along
sooner or later.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.687
Then we can
arrest them both.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.824
(phone ringing)

27:37.857 --> 27:39.125
Hey.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.426
I'm inside Claxion right now.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.729
I don't think
Alan Carverton killed his boss.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.263
He doesn't have the mouse,
anyway.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.698
Okay.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.767
Uh, there's a little bit
of a security situation.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.268
Apparently,
they're very paranoid

27:49.301 --> 27:50.937
about industrial espionage here.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.271
They got the building
on lockdown.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.906
You set off an alarm?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.174
I didn't set off the alarm.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.043
The research assistant
who didn't like me did.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.245
Brian, you're on NZT.
Are you seriously

27:59.278 --> 28:01.881
telling me you can't get
out of an office building?
(mice squeaking)

28:01.914 --> 28:04.884
Well, um, I just freed all their
lab mice, so they're all busy

28:04.917 --> 28:06.753
chasing their research
around the building.

28:06.786 --> 28:07.787
But, um, yeah...

28:09.488 --> 28:10.890
They've covered all the exits.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.158
There's no way out of here
right now.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.026
Unless...

28:14.060 --> 28:16.228
We have two SWAT teams
covering here, right?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.263
Yeah. Why?

28:20.332 --> 28:21.333
(alarm continues sounding)

28:21.367 --> 28:22.835
Get this one...

28:25.938 --> 28:26.773
Rebecca Harris, FBI.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.507
Claxion pulled us in
because they think

28:28.540 --> 28:30.777
whoever's in the building is
after government research.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.879
(sirens wailing
in distance)

28:43.155 --> 28:45.357
Brian?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.062
If anyone stops us on the way
out, you're my cyber consultant.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.065
And Brian, when I said I would
have your back, I didn't mean

28:53.099 --> 28:54.300
breaking and entering.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.035
Next time,
don't set off the alarm.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.939
So, she saved my ass,

28:59.972 --> 29:01.207
and walked me out
of that building.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.475
And how am I gonna repay her?

29:03.509 --> 29:05.912
Not just your garden-variety
betrayal. Nope.

29:05.945 --> 29:09.348
High treason for me.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.383
I mean, it doesn't
have to be that way.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.452
You definitely have
to lie to someone,

29:13.485 --> 29:16.055
but you can choose
who that is.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.157
I'm not sure why you'd
pick the one person

29:18.190 --> 29:21.460
who's looking out for you.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.963
He was right.
Or I was right. Whatever.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.366
Sands doesn't know
what's in the FBI files on NZT.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.468
So, how would he know
if he's getting real files?

29:29.501 --> 29:32.371
I didn't take NZT
until 10:30 that morning,

29:32.404 --> 29:34.173
so I had some time
to work with.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.375
I made up a fake history
of NZT in the FBI,

29:36.408 --> 29:38.044
based on speculation
and guesswork.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.411
Was it convincing?

29:39.445 --> 29:40.446
I think so.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.182
I hope so.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.793
You weren't followed?

29:56.128 --> 29:59.231
I don't think so?

29:59.265 --> 30:02.134
I was expecting Sands.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.469
You have something for us?

30:03.502 --> 30:06.005
Look, I don't know
if this is everything

30:06.038 --> 30:07.874
the FBI knows about NZT,

30:07.907 --> 30:10.009
but this is what my
boss had in her office.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.017
We'll be in touch.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.396
BRIAN:
Hey.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.431
What's going on in there?
REBECCA:
Kevin Lin came by

30:32.464 --> 30:35.434
the dead drop in Central Park
this morning. That was him.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.970
And Zhang tried to flee, but
we picked him up at the airport.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.238
He's on his way in now.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.439
Amazing. Well done.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.976
Hey, I think I have something
on your thing with the mouse.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.478
Yeah.
You gave me that list
of charities yesterday.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.580
The ones that Paul Wilkerman
was gonna leave his money to?

30:48.614 --> 30:51.117
Mm-hmm.
One of them was the
International Relief Fund?

30:51.150 --> 30:52.952
Yeah, that's right.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.220
They were in the paper
this morning.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.654
Paul Wilkerman pledged

30:55.687 --> 30:58.057
to give them one fifth of his
fortune, but they're learning

30:58.090 --> 31:00.326
that the changes in his will
were never executed.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.461
So they're out hundreds
of millions of dollars.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.965
Hundreds of millions of dollars
that now go to Wilkerman's kids.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.333
The heirs have motive.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.600
You're welcome.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.072
Just another shift
at the genius factory, boys.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.509
I ignored
my research assignment

31:17.543 --> 31:19.912
and spent the morning looking
into Paul Wilkerman's heirs.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.482
He had six kids by three women.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.085
None of them seem
too well adjusted.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.419
Not really a pretty picture.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.093
Of course, if one of them was
willing to kill their dad

31:34.126 --> 31:35.928
to get their hands
on his money,

31:35.962 --> 31:38.897
they had to be positive
he hadn't changed his will yet.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.435
There's only one person who
would have known that for sure.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.605
Wilkerman's probate attorney,
Raymond Dell.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.245
(phone ringing)

31:53.279 --> 31:55.314
Hey, Mom.

31:59.551 --> 32:00.519
Dad, what happened?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.321
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just...

32:02.354 --> 32:04.023
It's okay. Don't worry.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.225
Yeah, you're not okay. You got
admitted to the hospital.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.995
It's nothing
that can't be treated.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.596
Don't look at me like that.
I have a virus.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.697
Honey, could you give that?

32:13.099 --> 32:17.369
Right, it's called
a Cytomegalovirus.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.371
Cytomegalovirus?
What is that?

32:19.405 --> 32:24.143
It's something that happens
to some transplant patients.

32:24.176 --> 32:27.213
The drugs I'm taking
suppress my immune system.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.315
It's just a fever. That's all.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.649
That is not
what the doctor said.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.084
Okay, they said
that it could

32:32.118 --> 32:33.319
go into my organs.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.054
They're gonna watch me
for a couple of days.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.588
It's just like a flu, Brian.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.258
Yeah, except sometimes it's not.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.559
That's not gonna be me.

32:45.264 --> 32:48.234
It's what happens
to transplant patients.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.601
We get sick.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.639
We get sick.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.341
WOMAN (over P.A.):
I.V. Tech to Pedes.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.608
Available I.V. Tech
to Pedes.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.144
(footsteps approach,
chair legs clack)

33:01.313 --> 33:01.713
Sorry to hear

33:01.747 --> 33:03.349
about your dad.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.284
CMV.
That can be a nasty diagnosis.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.652
What are you doing here?

33:06.685 --> 33:08.354
I've got
to give you credit.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.390
You did a decent job
on those files.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.360
I've been handed loads
of bollocks in my day.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.395
Yours is truly a cut above.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.130
I want
the real files, Brian.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.066
And I want them tomorrow.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.633
That nurse.

33:21.667 --> 33:25.537
You said she was gonna take care
of my dad, not make him sick.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.139
Don't blame Sipiwe, mate.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.141
Forget her anyway. She's gone.

33:29.175 --> 33:32.144
Sipiwe didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.512
You did.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.647
All you said was you weren't
gonna give me

33:35.681 --> 33:36.782
another one of those shots.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.685
One of several possibilities.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.553
You did this, Brian.

33:41.587 --> 33:44.223
And for the moment,
you have the power to undo it.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.058
If you give me
what I ask for,

33:46.092 --> 33:47.593
I expect
your dad'll be fine.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.361
If you don't...

33:49.395 --> 33:52.464
well, who knows
how these things turn out?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.176
(Brian sighs heavily)

34:22.161 --> 34:24.163
*

34:29.701 --> 34:31.537
BRIAN: I tried to be loyal
to the FBI,

34:31.570 --> 34:33.071
and now my dad's
in the hospital.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.842
I'm making
those fingerprint molds,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.077
and I am getting
into that safe.

34:51.857 --> 34:52.858
Everything good
with your dad?

34:52.891 --> 34:55.261
Uh, he's stable,

34:55.294 --> 34:56.662
so he should be okay.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.730
Good. Mao Zhang just agreed
to make a statement.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.133
Everyone's heading down there.
You should come.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.334
You helped
make this happen.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.270
I'll be down
in a couple minutes.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.879
NAZ: Okay, Mr. Zhang.
(clears throat)

35:13.912 --> 35:15.747
Whenever
you're ready.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.617
My name is Mao Zhang,

35:18.650 --> 35:21.353
and I came to this country
as a believer in freedom.

35:21.387 --> 35:25.724
I would even call
myself a patriot.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.560
How did I become a spy?

35:28.594 --> 35:31.597
It wasn't a big decision
I made.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.334
It was more like a series of
small decisions I didn't make.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.641
(groans quietly)

36:06.565 --> 36:08.200
ZHANG:
I ran into Kevin Lin

36:08.234 --> 36:10.202
at a conference in Berlin.
He shared

36:10.236 --> 36:11.803
Chinese technology
with me.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.740
It was only later
I realized it was bait.

36:14.773 --> 36:19.511
I took money to share the plans
for a radar jamming system

36:19.545 --> 36:23.682
they had access to anyway.
But they used that against me.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.251
It snowballed quickly.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.760
BRIAN: A few of the letters
are more worn down than others.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.897
There's only one word
they combine to form.

36:38.930 --> 36:39.931
(whispers): Mercy.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.407
ZHANG: By the time I was
committing real treason,

36:48.440 --> 36:50.942
I didn't have a choice anymore.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.482
I never considered myself
a spy.

36:57.483 --> 37:01.753
In fact, I still believe...

37:01.787 --> 37:03.255
I am a patriot.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.662
That the good work I did
in my job

37:10.696 --> 37:13.999
outweighs the damage
from the secret I sold.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.442
You missed it.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.278
You all right today?

37:26.312 --> 37:27.279
Yeah.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.814
Just distracted, you know?

37:28.847 --> 37:30.516
Thinking about my dad.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.584
Where'd you wind up
with the Arthur Maciel thing?

37:32.618 --> 37:33.785
(sighing):
Arthur...

37:35.321 --> 37:37.689
Would you be willing
to run an errand with me?

37:39.725 --> 37:41.693
Excuse me?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.429
BRIAN:
Raymond Dell!

37:43.462 --> 37:44.596
I recognize you
from your pictures.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.798
You're Paul Wilkerman's
probate attorney.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.835
The super said that you were out
here looking through my garbage.

37:49.868 --> 37:50.969
Actually, it's not

37:51.002 --> 37:53.305
your garbage anymore, not
once you put it out here.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.641
Can I ask why the FBI
is looking through my trash?

37:55.674 --> 37:57.576
I'm sure you
already know this.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.312
Police found fingerprints from
a guy named Arthur Maciel

38:00.346 --> 38:02.448
at the scene of
your client's murder.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.316
They arrested him,
but, interestingly,

38:04.350 --> 38:05.617
someone else's DNA

38:05.651 --> 38:08.454
was found under Paul
Wilkerman's fingernails.
And once we realized

38:08.487 --> 38:10.589
Wilkerman's kids still
stood to inherit the money,

38:10.622 --> 38:12.324
we thought maybe it
came from one of them.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.460
But the DNA was from a
different family line.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.328
You are the only
person in the world

38:16.362 --> 38:18.330
who controlled whether or not
Paul Wilkerman's will

38:18.364 --> 38:21.367
was changed to reflect his new
thoughts on inherited wealth.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.768
And if you
did change it,

38:22.801 --> 38:25.604
that means that each of his kids
stood to lose...

38:25.637 --> 38:27.473
How much again?

38:27.506 --> 38:29.040
About a billion each.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.610
Ah. This is yours.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.011
BRIAN: So you could
change it,

38:33.044 --> 38:35.947
like Paul Wilkerman wanted,
and his heirs get nothing.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.416
Or...

38:37.449 --> 38:38.450
you sit on it

38:38.484 --> 38:40.118
and you put out some
discreet feelers

38:40.151 --> 38:42.120
to Wilkerman's less savory kids

38:42.153 --> 38:44.590
and you offer not
to file the papers

38:44.623 --> 38:46.124
and you get rid of Daddy.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.659
(chuckles)
And better yet,

38:47.693 --> 38:49.995
blame it on Daddy's old rival
Arthur Maciel.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.530
All in exchange for...

38:51.563 --> 38:53.999
what do you think, half?
Sure.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.000
That's ridiculous.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.635
Is it?

38:56.668 --> 38:57.836
You chew your pens.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.505
I used to do this.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.639
Probably a good DNA sample here.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.541
BRIAN: Oh, yeah.
Of course...

39:02.574 --> 39:04.643
if it is your DNA under
Paul Wilkerman's fingernails,

39:04.676 --> 39:07.045
we'll know soon enough.
Which means you have

39:07.078 --> 39:08.880
a very short amount
of time to cooperate.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.016
You could start by telling us
which of Paul's heirs

39:11.049 --> 39:12.418
you were
conspiring with.
And I want to know

39:12.451 --> 39:14.019
what you did
with Arthur's mouse.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.086
I do, too.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.090
(squeaking)

39:25.096 --> 39:26.532
(gasps)
Oh, he's alive.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.866
Oh, yeah, of course.
Dell kept him safe.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.535
Look, Arthur,

39:29.568 --> 39:30.836
if you're right about
what your gene therapy

39:30.869 --> 39:32.704
did to that mouse,

39:32.738 --> 39:34.706
he could be worth
a lot of money.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.709
I am right. You did
an incredible thing today.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.446
Not just for me. For everyone.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.650
You don't believe me.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.653
(wry chuckle)

39:47.686 --> 39:49.187
I don't know, Arthur.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.922
All I see is a mouse.

39:50.956 --> 39:51.923
Just wait.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.192
You know...

39:54.225 --> 39:57.496
even if you're not sure, you
still did an incredible thing.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.397
You got me out of prison.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.635
I owe you.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.737
Everything.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.974
Thank you.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.146
BRIAN:
Is he right?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.015
Am I still a good person,

40:17.048 --> 40:19.651
even after what I did today?

40:19.685 --> 40:21.186
On the other hand,

40:21.219 --> 40:23.655
until I hand this disk off
to Sands,

40:23.689 --> 40:25.491
I can learn more about NZT.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.595

40:36.835 --> 40:39.137
