WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:07.576
Okay, let's try this again.

00:07.577 --> 00:11.952
You take the part that isn't a triangle
and hit the part that is a triangle.

00:11.953 --> 00:14.713
- Got it?
- Shh.

00:15.591 --> 00:17.871
Excuse me.

00:23.157 --> 00:28.902
Oh, I'm sorry. Was my working at my job
getting in the way of your TV show?

00:28.903 --> 00:32.396
Yeah. That's why I
told you to "shh".

00:32.397 --> 00:35.009
We're watching every episode
of "Crime and Judgment".

00:35.010 --> 00:38.746
They just put out a collector's
edition of all 182 episodes.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.743
It also came in this cool
crime solving briefcase.

00:41.744 --> 00:44.685
Just like the one Detective
Mitchell uses on the show.

00:44.686 --> 00:48.586
Also makes a great
picnic basket.

00:52.190 --> 00:54.523
Yoo-hoo, team Austin and Ally!

00:54.524 --> 00:55.863
Remember me?

00:55.864 --> 00:58.830
How could we forget you, Val?

00:58.831 --> 01:02.308
You're the whacko producer who tried to
trick Ally into a five year contract.

01:02.309 --> 01:05.541
Oh, so you do remember.

01:05.542 --> 01:07.276
Listen, I need your help.

01:07.277 --> 01:11.280
My group, The Stray Kitties, are
one big hit away from having...

01:11.281 --> 01:13.745
Well, one big hit.

01:13.746 --> 01:18.944
And Ally, I want you and Austin to write
the song that's gonna put them on the map.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.725
- We'd love to, but...
- Oh, great! Now let's talk money.

01:21.726 --> 01:23.970
- Oh, you didn't let me finish...
- Ally, don't be rude.

01:23.971 --> 01:27.089
The lady's talking money.

01:27.090 --> 01:29.934
Guys, we're not gonna
write her a song.

01:29.935 --> 01:31.836
Sorry, Val. We're just
too busy right now.

01:31.837 --> 01:37.521
Yeah. Between working on our own music
and not really trusting you whatsoever.

01:37.522 --> 01:39.744
It's just not gonna happen.

01:39.745 --> 01:43.581
Okay. Well. It was worth a shot.

01:43.582 --> 01:46.185
I wish you all the
luck in the world.

01:46.186 --> 01:48.753
I wish you all the
luck in the world.

01:48.754 --> 01:50.921
Isn't that coffee hot?

01:50.922 --> 01:54.822
Oh, it's scorching. Bye-bye now.

02:56.422 --> 02:58.323
This song rocks.

02:58.324 --> 03:00.106
I'm ready to put it
out as my new single.

03:00.107 --> 03:02.625
Shouldn't your new
single have...

03:02.626 --> 03:04.413
Lyrics?

03:04.414 --> 03:06.911
I knew it was missing something.

03:06.912 --> 03:09.481
Why don't you take a shot
at writing the lyrics?

03:09.482 --> 03:13.307
Ally, last time I tried to write
by myself, it was a disaster.

03:13.308 --> 03:15.828
So you struck out once.

03:15.829 --> 03:21.729
You got to pick your racket back up and
hit that puck right through that hoop.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.838
You should really avoid
sports analogies.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.212
But maybe you're right.

03:28.213 --> 03:29.676
I should give this another shot.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.212
I was hoping you'd say that.

03:31.213 --> 03:32.317
Here.

03:32.318 --> 03:34.255
I got you your very
own song book.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.074
- Aw, thanks, Ally.
- And look, it even has...

03:37.075 --> 03:40.135
Don't touch my book.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.972
I can do this.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.334
I know you can. Just think
about your favorite things.

03:46.335 --> 03:49.853
People you care about.
Write what you know.

03:49.854 --> 03:53.588
Well, that rules out geography.
Because I just bombed my test.

03:53.589 --> 03:57.445
Did you know there's
a West Virginia?

03:57.446 --> 04:00.146
Yes. Yes I did.

04:11.782 --> 04:14.242
182 episodes.

04:14.306 --> 04:16.226
Done.

04:16.377 --> 04:20.399
Totally worth not sleeping
for four straight days.

04:20.401 --> 04:22.203
- Let's watch the whole series again!
- Woo!

04:22.204 --> 04:24.780
Yes! "Crime and Judgment"
Marathon, round two.

04:24.781 --> 04:25.862
No.

04:25.863 --> 04:31.763
It would be a crime for you to sit here
watching TV for another four days.

04:31.866 --> 04:34.694
That is my judgment.

04:34.695 --> 04:39.220
Woo! I did it, guys. I wrote all
the lyrics to a song by myself.

04:39.221 --> 04:40.873
I knew you could do it.

04:40.874 --> 04:44.534
You wrote a song by yourself?

04:45.248 --> 04:47.880
Let me just save
you the trouble.

04:47.881 --> 04:50.881
It's not very good.

04:50.939 --> 04:52.995
Trish, you haven't
even heard it yet.

04:52.996 --> 04:54.828
Yeah. I think I've got a hit.

04:54.829 --> 04:58.272
I can't believe I was so caught up in
this show I missed you writing a song.

04:58.273 --> 04:59.340
What else did I miss?

04:59.341 --> 05:01.903
Is there a new President? Was
there a zombie apocalypse?

05:01.904 --> 05:04.564
I've got to call my grandma.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.850
Dez, don't be ridiculous.

05:06.851 --> 05:09.283
You're right. It's too late
to save her from zombies.

05:09.284 --> 05:14.389
That motorized scooter only
goes like two miles an hour.

05:14.390 --> 05:16.687
<i>♪ Breaking down.</i>

05:16.688 --> 05:18.126
<i>♪ So you can't hide it.</i>

05:18.127 --> 05:23.587
<i>♪ No matter what you do. I'm
gonna steal your heart.</i>

05:23.887 --> 05:27.301
- Wow. Your song's all over the radio.
- This is so exciting.

05:27.302 --> 05:29.860
- Thanks.
- All right, let's cut to the chase.

05:29.861 --> 05:32.571
This song's obviously
about a girl.

05:32.572 --> 05:34.024
"You drive me crazy"?

05:34.025 --> 05:35.409
"Angel smile"?

05:35.410 --> 05:36.454
Who is she?

05:36.455 --> 05:38.217
No one. It's not about anyone.

05:38.218 --> 05:41.814
Oh, come on. It's not about
someone who's say...

05:41.815 --> 05:45.302
Wearing a striped shirt and picking
something out of her hair?

05:45.303 --> 05:49.629
How'd I get a candy corn in here?
It's not even in season.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.388
It's not about Ally. I told
you, it's not about anyone.

05:52.389 --> 05:54.627
I just wrote the lyrics
that sounded cool to me.

05:54.628 --> 05:57.130
I write love songs all the
time that aren't about anyone.

05:57.131 --> 05:58.211
See?

05:58.212 --> 06:00.878
I don't know why you're
being so secretive, Austin.

06:00.879 --> 06:03.536
These are the kinds of things
your fans want to know about.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.605
My fans love my music,
not the gossip.

06:06.606 --> 06:10.810
I guarantee they don't
care who the song's about.

06:10.811 --> 06:14.411
Okay, so maybe they do care.

06:14.413 --> 06:17.516
Your fans aren't gonna leave you
alone until you say who it's about.

06:17.517 --> 06:19.249
It's all over the Internet.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.686
And these magazines.

06:20.687 --> 06:23.671
I mean, I get "Teen
Scoop" and "Miami Music".

06:23.672 --> 06:26.372
But "Fancy Cat"?

06:27.167 --> 06:29.252
Well, he does have
a feline quality.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.564
Sort of an American Longhair.

06:31.565 --> 06:34.501
Dez, I'm not an
American Longhair.

06:34.502 --> 06:38.162
Well, you're no Russian Blue.

06:46.092 --> 06:48.808
This is every girl you've
ever been seen with.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.067
Including me.

06:51.068 --> 06:54.739
And seriously, they couldn't
find a better picture?

06:54.740 --> 06:59.098
Look, Austin. If the song's not
about Ally, then who's it about?

06:59.099 --> 07:02.246
We know it's about somebody.
Just give us a name.

07:02.247 --> 07:05.067
What's her name?!

07:05.255 --> 07:07.609
Fine. Do you want a name?

07:07.610 --> 07:09.018
It's...

07:09.019 --> 07:11.221
Guitarla...

07:11.222 --> 07:13.189
Drumly.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.992
Guitarla Drumly. We're dating.

07:15.993 --> 07:19.773
Oh, Guitarla Drumly. How exotic.

07:20.030 --> 07:23.133
Dez, he's not actually
dating Guitarla Drumly.

07:23.134 --> 07:24.934
Oh.

07:25.202 --> 07:27.764
Then can I have her number?

07:27.765 --> 07:30.765
I like exotic girls.

07:32.209 --> 07:34.648
I still think the
song's about you, Ally.

07:34.649 --> 07:39.215
It's not about me. We agreed to
just be friends a long time ago.

07:39.216 --> 07:41.572
You just shifted your
eyes to the left.

07:41.573 --> 07:44.287
A sure sign you're
hiding something.

07:44.288 --> 07:45.611
Now she blinked!

07:45.612 --> 07:48.458
A definite sign she's
hiding something.

07:48.459 --> 07:51.136
You guys have been watching way
too much "Crime & Judgment".

07:51.137 --> 07:53.842
Now she's rolling her eyes.
Now she's shaking her head.

07:53.843 --> 07:56.444
Now she's turning away.
Now she's walking away.

07:56.445 --> 07:58.624
Now she's leaving.

07:58.625 --> 08:02.398
I guess we'll never know
if the song's about her.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.487
It's not about her.
It's about me.

08:05.488 --> 08:07.804
Brooke. We didn't
see you come in.

08:07.805 --> 08:09.612
I want to put the
rumors to rest.

08:09.613 --> 08:15.513
Austin's clearly still hung up on our
epic on-again off-again romance.

08:16.155 --> 08:18.848
More like off-again,
never-again.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.950
You guys went on two dates.

08:20.951 --> 08:22.293
37.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.312
If you count the
ones in my dreams.

08:25.313 --> 08:29.361
Look. I made a page in my
scrapbook for every date.

08:29.362 --> 08:32.239
Wow. You two are more
serious than I thought.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.466
There's no way it's about her.

08:34.467 --> 08:39.136
Trust me, when they stopped dating
Austin was so relieved when she...

08:39.138 --> 08:40.967
Disappeared.

08:40.969 --> 08:43.542
Man, she's like a ninja.

08:43.543 --> 08:46.612
I wouldn't rule
Brooke out just yet.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.680
I saw them together
a few weeks ago.

08:48.681 --> 08:54.581
I was frosting a cake at school
when I overheard them talking.

08:54.654 --> 08:56.688
Thanks a lot, Austin.

08:56.689 --> 08:59.929
I'll never forget this.

09:05.464 --> 09:07.599
Well, that sounds suspicious.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.368
All this time I thought
it was about Ally.

09:10.369 --> 09:12.437
But that makes it
sound like Brooke.

09:12.438 --> 09:13.639
Not so fast.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.174
I also saw something
suspicious at the Mall.

09:16.175 --> 09:18.614
I was frosting a cake at
"Everything's Beachy" when...

09:18.615 --> 09:21.195
Wait a minute.

09:21.781 --> 09:23.682
Why are you always
frosting cakes?

09:23.683 --> 09:26.685
Oh. I got an online coupon
for a cake decorating class.

09:26.686 --> 09:28.654
Anyway...

09:28.655 --> 09:29.992
I'm really glad
we're doing this.

09:29.993 --> 09:32.980
Me too. The most important thing
is that nobody finds out.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.526
It would ruin everything.

09:34.527 --> 09:37.226
Yeah. For now, it'll just
be our little secret.

09:37.227 --> 09:39.133
You know, you're a
really sweet guy.

09:39.134 --> 09:41.234
I know.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.910
Sounds like they're hiding the
fact that they're back together.

09:50.911 --> 09:53.171
That makes Kira
suspect number one.

09:53.172 --> 09:57.449
You'd think. But I also saw Austin and
that European supermodel together.

09:57.450 --> 10:00.418
- I was at Mini's...
- Let me guess. Frosting a cake?

10:00.419 --> 10:05.759
No. I was working on little
sugar brides and grooms.

10:06.234 --> 10:09.075
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.752
I love you.

10:10.753 --> 10:13.153
I love you.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.769
Oh my gosh, this is crazy!

10:17.770 --> 10:20.706
I'm even more confused now
than when we started.

10:20.707 --> 10:24.233
I know. And get this!
Just the other day...

10:24.234 --> 10:26.926
This is the best
cake I've ever had.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.783
Thanks, buddy.

10:28.784 --> 10:30.944
What up?

10:33.106 --> 10:35.754
Wait. What does that have
to do with anything?

10:35.755 --> 10:41.655
Nothing. I just wanted you to know
I make a pretty mean wedding cake.

10:48.163 --> 10:51.470
We know you were with Brooke,
Kira, and the European model.

10:51.471 --> 10:53.773
The song's got to be
about one of them.

10:53.774 --> 10:56.090
Just tell us who.

10:56.091 --> 10:57.794
I'm not saying anything.

10:57.795 --> 11:01.645
Look. We could be
here all night.

11:01.646 --> 11:06.048
Actually, I got to be home by 7:00.
My mom's making pork chops.

11:06.049 --> 11:08.287
Why are you guys
interrogating him?

11:08.288 --> 11:11.228
We've seen 182 episodes
of "Crime & Judgment".

11:11.229 --> 11:12.879
This is how you get answers.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.261
I have a question
that needs answering.

11:15.262 --> 11:17.630
Why did Austin steal my song?

11:17.631 --> 11:20.433
- Huh?
- Say what now?

11:20.434 --> 11:24.791
I wrote the song "Steal Your
Heart," then Austin stole it.

11:24.792 --> 11:27.474
Well, the song. Not my heart.

11:27.475 --> 11:29.148
What? No, I didn't.

11:29.149 --> 11:32.302
Wow. We knew you were
missing a few screws, lady,

11:32.303 --> 11:35.043
but we didn't know you
lost the whole toolbox.

11:35.044 --> 11:36.850
Oh, don't act so innocent.

11:36.851 --> 11:39.318
You three helped him
steal the song.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.239
What?

11:42.085 --> 11:44.874
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.892
A Judge will be the
Judge of that.

11:46.893 --> 11:49.225
- What?
- What are you talking about?

11:49.226 --> 11:51.044
What's a subpoena?

11:51.045 --> 11:53.366
You're suing us for stealing
"Steal Your Heart?"

11:53.367 --> 11:56.407
You're just doing this to get revenge
because we wouldn't write you a song.

11:56.408 --> 11:59.805
Maybe. A Judge will
be the Judge of that.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.871
You already said that.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.692
See you in court.

12:08.403 --> 12:09.997
This is bad.

12:09.998 --> 12:14.335
If Austin's fans think he stole
the song, his career is over.

12:14.336 --> 12:17.374
And I'm talking playing for
pennies on the street over.

12:17.375 --> 12:21.175
Change your name and move
to North Dakota over.

12:21.176 --> 12:24.416
There's a North Dakota?

12:25.284 --> 12:29.244
We really need to get you a map.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.293
Order. Order.

12:39.976 --> 12:44.109
I hereby call to order
case number 4284.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.758
The matter of...

12:45.759 --> 12:48.699
Ooh, a stolen song.

12:48.795 --> 12:51.555
Ooh! Austin Moon.

12:51.883 --> 12:54.429
This is going to be
better than I thought.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.494
Trish, are you sure
you're ready for this?

12:56.495 --> 13:00.265
Hey. I've watched 182 episodes
of "Crime & Judgment".

13:00.266 --> 13:03.402
If that doesn't qualify me to
represent us, then what does?

13:03.403 --> 13:05.441
I don't know. Maybe three
years of law school,

13:05.442 --> 13:07.601
a few internships,
passing the Bar Exam.

13:07.602 --> 13:10.002
I got this.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.181
Trish De La Rosa for the
defense, your honor.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.883
My client's innocent.

13:13.884 --> 13:15.572
He wrote the song in question.

13:15.573 --> 13:18.865
Also objection, overruled,
sidebar, recess,

13:18.866 --> 13:20.344
- habeas corpus.
- Excuse me?

13:20.345 --> 13:23.315
Just proving I know
what I'm doing, Sir.

13:23.316 --> 13:28.197
And I am here to prove that I wrote
the song and Austin Moon is a thief.

13:28.198 --> 13:33.478
This is getting good. Let's
get this trial started.

13:33.783 --> 13:37.633
Ms. Crawford, do you have any evidence
to prove you wrote this song?

13:37.634 --> 13:43.312
I do, your honor. And I'll show you that
evidence by calling my first witness.

13:43.313 --> 13:46.492
Dez, I couldn't help but
notice you carry a briefcase.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.626
Is that new?

13:47.627 --> 13:51.021
Yep. Just like the one Detective
Mitchell uses in "Crime & Judgment".

13:51.022 --> 13:53.698
- Got it a few weeks ago.
- Interesting.

13:53.699 --> 13:58.683
Because it's just like the one I had
before it went missing a few weeks ago.

13:58.684 --> 14:01.507
Well, this one is mine.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.046
It even has a notebook
with your name on it,

14:05.047 --> 14:08.378
a driver's license with
your name on it...

14:08.379 --> 14:11.282
The lyric sheet to "Steal Your
Heart" with your name on it.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.143
Hey.

14:13.724 --> 14:15.414
Oh, snap.

14:15.415 --> 14:17.356
Val just busted you.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.591
Ahem! I mean, proceed.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.511
- How did I get all your stuff?
- You stole my briefcase!

14:22.512 --> 14:28.122
Your honor, these are my handwritten
lyrics that prove I wrote the song.

14:28.123 --> 14:30.269
That's pretty
compelling evidence.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.472
Objection! She's lying
and we can prove it.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.374
Can we prove it?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.110
Actually...

14:37.111 --> 14:39.378
I think I can.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.381
Your honor, I would like
to submit the book I

14:41.382 --> 14:43.482
gave Austin to write
"Steal Your Heart" in.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.251
If you open it, you'll
find that it is...

14:46.252 --> 14:48.952
Completely blank.

14:49.173 --> 14:52.989
I didn't write it in the book.
I wrote it on a napkin.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.561
It's right here in my pants.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.530
Which my mom apparently washed.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.688
Mr. Moon, if you can't
offer any real evidence,

15:01.689 --> 15:07.509
I'll have no choice but to
rule in favor of Ms. Crawford.

15:11.029 --> 15:14.389
What are we going to do?

15:14.928 --> 15:18.667
Austin, if you come clean and tell
the court who the song is about,

15:18.668 --> 15:21.316
maybe we can convince the
Judge you didn't steal it.

15:21.317 --> 15:22.907
But it's not about anybody.

15:22.908 --> 15:25.186
I know that's not true.

15:25.187 --> 15:28.123
And since you won't tell me,
I'll prove it another way.

15:28.124 --> 15:31.931
Judge, I'd like to
call my first witness.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.870
Your honor, it's pretty
obvious the song in

15:34.882 --> 15:37.832
question was written
about a special girl.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.482
And I'm gonna prove
who that girl is.

15:40.483 --> 15:44.553
Brooke, three weeks ago Austin
gave you flowers at school.

15:44.554 --> 15:46.085
Did he not?

15:46.086 --> 15:48.001
Well...

15:48.002 --> 15:50.402
Not exactly.

15:51.079 --> 15:54.309
Here's what happened.
We were in school...

15:54.310 --> 15:55.864
Did you get my flowers?

15:55.865 --> 15:59.259
Brooke, I told you.
I'm not interested.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.518
I can't take these.

16:01.519 --> 16:03.653
Thanks a lot, Austin.

16:03.654 --> 16:06.894
I'll never forget this.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.823
Okay. So the song's
not about Brooke.

16:14.824 --> 16:18.784
Uh. We don't know that for sure.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.631
He's not into you.

16:20.632 --> 16:22.792
Move on.

16:25.478 --> 16:29.096
Can you describe the nature of
your relationship with Austin?

16:29.097 --> 16:30.756
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.398
You hear that?

16:32.399 --> 16:37.242
They've even been spotted
saying "I love you" in public.

16:37.243 --> 16:39.078
I love you.

16:39.079 --> 16:40.644
I object!

16:40.645 --> 16:42.595
Me too! We're not in love.

16:42.596 --> 16:46.796
I've been giving her
English lessons.

16:49.746 --> 16:51.580
I love you.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.981
I love you.

16:54.165 --> 16:56.057
I love pancakes.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.756
I love pancakes.

16:57.757 --> 17:00.397
- Boom.
- Boom.

17:03.342 --> 17:04.684
Next witness.

17:04.685 --> 17:07.121
- I love you.
- Yeah yeah yeah. I love you too.

17:07.122 --> 17:09.892
Get off the stand.

17:09.893 --> 17:13.446
It's come to my attention that
you and Austin have a secret.

17:13.448 --> 17:15.828
Is this true?

17:15.829 --> 17:17.404
Um...

17:17.405 --> 17:20.224
Yes, that's true.

17:22.377 --> 17:23.676
Order.

17:23.678 --> 17:27.748
Finally. Now, tell the court what
secret you and Austin are hiding.

17:27.749 --> 17:29.783
I can't say.

17:29.784 --> 17:33.133
Austin's reputation
depends on it.

17:33.134 --> 17:35.309
I really can't tell you.

17:35.310 --> 17:38.195
Remember, Miss Starr,
you're under oath.

17:38.196 --> 17:41.616
Now spill the juicy deets.

17:42.573 --> 17:47.270
Fine. I was helping Austin get Maroon
5 to play at Ally's surprise party.

17:47.271 --> 17:49.071
Aw.

17:49.608 --> 17:52.136
You guys are throwing
me a surprise party?

17:52.137 --> 17:54.537
Not anymore.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.049
Oh man.

17:57.050 --> 17:59.860
Oh, this is a waste
of time, your honor.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.962
Trish hasn't proven anything.

18:01.963 --> 18:05.255
She's just stalling because
she doesn't have a case.

18:05.256 --> 18:07.467
I'm afraid she's right, Mr.
Moon.

18:07.468 --> 18:09.776
I have no choice but to
rule in favor of Ms...

18:09.777 --> 18:11.697
Wait!

18:11.894 --> 18:15.164
- Don't make your decision yet.
- You have new evidence to introduce?

18:15.165 --> 18:19.509
Oh no, I was just in the bathroom.
I didn't want to miss anything.

18:19.510 --> 18:24.241
Your honor, before you make your ruling,
I have one more piece of evidence.

18:24.242 --> 18:27.074
Austin, I'd like you to
sing "Steal Your Heart".

18:27.075 --> 18:30.075
Ooh! That's my jam.

18:30.703 --> 18:32.315
How is this gonna help?

18:32.316 --> 18:35.185
Just do it. You have
to trust Trish.

18:35.186 --> 18:36.878
And the writers of
"Crime & Judgment" who

18:36.879 --> 18:39.556
taught her everything she
knows about the law.

18:39.557 --> 18:41.458
Mm-mm! Mm-mm!

18:41.459 --> 18:43.126
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

18:43.127 --> 18:46.296
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-
-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

18:46.297 --> 18:48.517
I object.

18:48.566 --> 18:49.994
How is this relevant?

18:49.995 --> 18:52.693
I don't know. But I want
to see Austin perform.

18:52.694 --> 18:56.095
Now, while Austin gets ready,
let's take a 15 minute recess.

18:56.096 --> 19:00.646
Yay, recess. Meet you
on the monkey bars.

19:00.647 --> 19:02.747
Hit it.

19:04.793 --> 19:07.150
<i>♪ You're a good girl.</i>

20:15.152 --> 20:17.081
Well, there's your proof, Sir.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.051
That he's a great
singer and dancer?

20:19.052 --> 20:21.690
We knew that already.

20:21.691 --> 20:23.326
No.

20:23.327 --> 20:25.693
Now we know who Austin
wrote the song about.

20:25.694 --> 20:27.163
We do?

20:27.164 --> 20:28.197
Yes.

20:28.198 --> 20:31.534
When he sang, he looked at
every girl in the room.

20:31.535 --> 20:32.878
Except one.

20:32.879 --> 20:35.438
There's an obvious explanation.

20:35.439 --> 20:37.340
It was too emotional for him.

20:37.341 --> 20:41.241
Austin wrote the
song about Ally.

20:42.179 --> 20:43.380
Order in the court.

20:43.381 --> 20:46.449
Um, your honor, may I
approach the witness stand?

20:46.450 --> 20:49.756
You already have, so... yes.

20:49.757 --> 20:52.379
Austin, is it true?

20:52.380 --> 20:55.525
You wrote it about me?

20:55.526 --> 20:57.568
Yeah, it's true.

20:57.569 --> 21:00.463
I should have told you
earlier, but I couldn't.

21:00.464 --> 21:06.364
You told me to write about someone
I care about and that's you.

21:06.527 --> 21:10.173
Do you still have
feelings for me?

21:10.174 --> 21:11.907
No.

21:11.908 --> 21:13.476
Yes.

21:13.477 --> 21:15.967
I don't know.

21:15.968 --> 21:18.072
All I know is I love
being friends with you.

21:18.073 --> 21:20.149
And I don't want to ruin that.

21:20.150 --> 21:22.658
That's why I couldn't
say it was about you.

21:22.659 --> 21:24.459
Aw.

21:27.295 --> 21:28.735
I get it.

21:28.736 --> 21:33.296
I'm happy we're still just friends,
but I kind of hoped it was about me.

21:33.297 --> 21:35.097
Aw.

21:36.813 --> 21:38.673
Ewe!

21:39.664 --> 21:41.638
Your honor, this proves nothing.

21:41.639 --> 21:45.106
After seeing that performance and
watching these two together,

21:45.107 --> 21:48.210
nothing can convince me
Austin didn't write the song.

21:48.211 --> 21:49.819
But wait wait, your honor.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.247
What about the briefcase?

21:51.248 --> 21:55.032
Anyone who saw episode 73 of
"Crime & Judgment" knows,

21:55.033 --> 21:58.505
the briefcases could
have been switched.

21:58.506 --> 22:01.324
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

22:01.325 --> 22:03.292
A Judge will be the
Judge of that.

22:03.293 --> 22:05.213
What?

22:05.295 --> 22:08.175
What's a subpoena?

22:10.601 --> 22:13.603
You watch "Crime
& Judgment" too?

22:13.604 --> 22:15.472
All eight seasons.

22:15.473 --> 22:18.053
Case dismissed.

Your honor, I've already
sung it eight times.

22:42.467 --> 22:44.333
I told you...

22:44.334 --> 22:46.335
It was my jam.

22:46.336 --> 22:48.856
Hit it, Ally.
