9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.806
-Help me get her some air.
-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.475
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.310
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:09.343 --> 00:12.346
Empire, Lethal Weapon,

00:12.380 --> 00:14.482
We need your help,
even if we don't trust you.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.155
("Trapped" by Bruce Springsteen
playing)

00:21.189 --> 00:24.158
ABBY:
People are resilient.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.894
I think we're designed
that way.

00:26.927 --> 00:31.832
It's embedded in our DNA
to forge ahead, soldier on.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.868
It's a whole lot easier to do
with an army at your back.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.239
OFFICER :
Got to keep moving, brother.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.940
Can't sleep here. Keep moving.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.176
ABBY: But sometimes it feels
like we're on our own.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.846
* It seems like I'm caught up
in your trap again... *

00:45.879 --> 00:47.281
It might even feel
like the world

00:47.315 --> 00:49.183
is conspiring against us
at times.

00:50.784 --> 00:54.622
A test to see
just how much we can take.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.459
How do you get out?
How do you break the cycle?

00:58.492 --> 01:01.362
* Well, now I'm trapped

01:01.395 --> 01:04.732
* Ooh, yeah

01:04.765 --> 01:07.067
* I'm trapped.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.611
Oh, no!

01:17.645 --> 01:19.580
Wait!

01:19.613 --> 01:20.814
No! No!

01:51.279 --> 01:53.781
What's this dude's problem?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.783
Seriously

01:57.885 --> 02:00.321
-We're gonna have to get
in front of him.
-Okay.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.764
-You got a guy trapped inside,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.633
-inside the compactor.
-That's impossible.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.635
He dialed 911 from inside.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.136
No, I mean that's not possible.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.605
We haven't
picked any garbage up yet.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.039
Wait, what?

02:19.072 --> 02:21.309
You got the wrong truck, man.
She's empty.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.277
-It's the wrong truck.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.679
Um, thank you. Carry on.
Y-You're doing a great job.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.948
Dispatch, this is T-118.
We are at Chandler and Allott.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.350
We have the wrong garbage truck.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.520
Do you have a location
for the garbage truck?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.787
ATHENA:
This is 727-L-30.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.323
I got eyes
on your garbage truck.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.458
Corner of Ventura and Stern.
Search and Rescue on the way.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.560
-That's, like, two blocks away.
-Let's go.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.828
All right.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.837
MAN:
Help!

02:49.870 --> 02:51.305
-Turn it off!
-Help!

02:51.339 --> 02:53.407
-Turn off the compactor now!

02:53.441 --> 02:55.476
-Turn off the compactor!
-Help!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.911
-There's someone inside.
!

02:57.945 --> 02:59.980
-The Dumpster. He was asleep.
-How was I supposed to know

03:00.013 --> 03:01.682
he was sleeping
in one of the Dumpsters?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.851
-You're not in any trouble.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.719
-Yeah.
-What kind of pressure
does it operate under?

03:05.753 --> 03:08.155
I don't know.
2,000 PSI

03:08.188 --> 03:09.590
That would crush a car.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.559
GARBAGEMAN:
Damn. Look at her go.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.096
Hello

03:16.129 --> 03:17.498
Can you hear us?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.999
Ooh, this stinks.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.701
People call us heroes?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.703
-BUCK: Oh, Hen, hold up.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.204
It's gonna take forever by hand.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.673
Hey, Chim, can you grab shovels?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.840
Come on, what are you,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.008
scared to get
your hands dirty, Buck?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.209
Come on, let's go!

03:31.479 --> 03:33.881
-I don't know.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.617
-But if I were you,
I'd stay out of her way.
-CHIMNEY: I'm coming in.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.688
You got that.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.922
GARBAGEMAN:
Wait, so, he was, uh,

03:41.955 --> 03:43.391
he was sleeping in a Dumpster,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
-They give them to the homeless.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.395
It's part
of the Lifeline program.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.631
Keeps them connected to family,
if they have any.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.472
I got him. I see a foot!

04:00.341 --> 04:02.109
-I got it.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.113
I got a pulse.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.415
Stay still, sir.
Do not move your neck.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.116
Chim, get me a neck brace
and a board in here.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.452
-We got to get him out of here.
-I don't understand.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.487
How'd he survive
that kind of pressure?

04:13.521 --> 04:14.588
Probably fell
into this pocket here.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.156
He got protected by the chair.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.725
Sir, can you hear me?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.493
Can you hear me?
Does it hurt when you breathe?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.962
It hurts.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.498
-I can't feel my legs.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.166
We're gonna get you
out of there.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.735
You're gonna be all right, okay?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.337
-Sam.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.972
You're gonna be all right, Sam.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.688
ABBY:
So, Carla,

04:47.721 --> 04:50.090
it's your last chance to tell me

04:50.123 --> 04:52.526
if you're not up
for working extra hours.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.429
When have you ever
known me not to speak my mind?

04:55.463 --> 04:58.766
Very true.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.768
-Well, I appreciate it.
-Mm-hmm.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.269
Buck and I are both working
the graveyard shift,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.104
and then he has a little
breakfast date planned for us.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.806
-Ooh.
-And considering

05:05.839 --> 05:07.875
our last proper date was
scheduled when you and I

05:07.908 --> 05:09.543
: were in
the E.R. with her.
-Uh-huh.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.045
Well, have fun, all right.
I could use the overtime.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.347
-Okay, good. Good.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.350
Hope this date
is him having you rub baby oil

05:16.384 --> 05:18.352
-on his biceps.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.488
Okay, Mom.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.990
-I got to go to work.
-Stay.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.392
-Mom.
-Stay, please.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.860
-I know. I wish I could.
-Stay. Stay.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.029
-Please.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.864
It's okay. I'll see you
in the morning, okay?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.067
Are you okay?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.536
-Come on. Come on.
-Oh, my God.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.271
Do you... do you need some ice?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.011
I'm good. I mean...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.913
She's getting worse.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.915
Maybe it...

05:47.948 --> 05:49.983
This could be another episode.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.653
Oh, God.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.488
-It's okay.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.557
-I should stay. I'm not...
-No. No.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.592
-No, no, no. Get out of here.
-No, I mean, this is...

05:58.626 --> 06:02.095
Go to work. Go to your date.
Go be young while you still are.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.504
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.872
Yeah. Okay.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.907
Oh, my God.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.178
I didn't ask you to lunch

06:18.211 --> 06:22.182
just so I can buy you
a hot dog you won't eat.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.418
Talk to me.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.020
Is this about Karen?
Did you tell her?

06:27.054 --> 06:29.022
I didn't have to.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.593
She already knew.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.728
And she presented me
with papers.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.665
-Custody.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.536
My ex is suing us for custody.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.772
On what grounds?

06:44.805 --> 06:46.607
'Cause she's the birth mother.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.243
And that she gave up the baby
under duress.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.580
Does she have a chance?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.281
Well, I read about a case

06:54.314 --> 06:57.250
in Michigan where they took
a five-year-old little boy

06:57.284 --> 06:59.219
away from the only family
he ever knew

06:59.252 --> 07:00.954
and gave him
to his birth father.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.725
I mean, her chances are slim,
but they're not zero.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.660
And now she's saying that...

07:06.694 --> 07:10.964
that Denny's living
in an unstable home because...

07:10.998 --> 07:13.266
because I stepped out
on my wife.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.570
With the same damn woman
who's suing you for custody?

07:16.604 --> 07:20.508
All I know
is that I just feel like...

07:20.541 --> 07:22.843
covering myself in all that
garbage we just dug through

07:22.876 --> 07:24.912
and letting the compactor
just squish me into nothing.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.413
You gonna get through this.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.949
And I'm here to help.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.351
I mean, if you need
the number of a good lawyer...

07:31.384 --> 07:33.954
Divorce or custody?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.023
Between my wife and my ex,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.925
I don't know who
I'm-a face in court first.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.928
You know,
my recommendation for you

07:40.961 --> 07:43.531
will be make divorce
the last option.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.199
It's hard work,
especially if you have kids.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.839
You and Michael--
y'all gonna get a divorce?

07:51.872 --> 07:54.542
It's time.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.110
I mean, I'm not sad about...

07:57.144 --> 07:59.847
I am, but I know
it's the right thing.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.214
Mm-hmm.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.450
And I feel excited
about the future, you know,

08:03.483 --> 08:07.988
about not feeling so confused
all the time.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.990
You finding anyone new?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.662
Dang, girl, already?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.864
What
Get out of here with that.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.632
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.634
I'm still trapped in my past.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.636
You just got free.
You gonna tell me about this.

08:22.670 --> 08:26.974
The other night,
I met a guy at a bar.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.810
Wow.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.914
Athena Grant let a stranger
pick her up and take her home?

08:33.947 --> 08:36.750
Oh, I did a background check.
Yeah, no.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.219
My plan wasn't
to go home with him,

08:39.252 --> 08:41.154
but he was just...

08:43.223 --> 08:45.358
-Needed to feel like a woman.
-Mm.

08:45.392 --> 08:49.863
I left there thinking that,
you know...

08:49.897 --> 08:52.566
-that's a one-hit wonder.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.337
-Guess I made an impression.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.372
-Tomorrow right after my shift.
-Oh!

09:08.315 --> 09:10.784
We're late. Again.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.519
Dr. Franks doesn't care.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.388
Because Dr. Franks gets to
charge us for the whole session,

09:15.422 --> 09:17.390
no matter how much of it
we miss.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.026
Maybe it's not worth it, okay?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.294
I don't think Dr. Franks
is really doing any good.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.263
Because you are not trying.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.568
To grow up.
To be an adult.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.642
You're 18, not eight.
You don't have a job.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.744
-You are not in school.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.478
You flunked out
after one semester--

09:38.511 --> 09:40.447
which, honestly, I did not
even realize was possible--

09:40.480 --> 09:42.916
because you did not try.
You never try.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.585
So I haven't figured out yet
what I want to do with my life.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.987
-Okay, does that...

09:47.020 --> 09:49.389
Do you think that I really want
to spend 80 hours a week

09:49.422 --> 09:51.291
hawking luxury lofts
and million

09:51.324 --> 09:53.026
-No, I really don't.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.500
Ow!

10:08.208 --> 10:09.877
Mom?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.480
M

10:13.513 --> 10:16.216
Mom! Mom, are you okay?!

10:34.634 --> 10:36.970
All the cars are locked down.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.040
Car three was headed up to 14,
and somewhere around eight,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.875
damn thing just started
dropping like a rock.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.711
-Dispatch says two:

10:43.744 --> 10:45.512
a mother and her teenage son.
The mother's hurt.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.114
BOBBY:
Where's the car now?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
DAVIS:
Halfway below basement level.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.316
That's the other problem.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.284
-Since this morning.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.688
Third one this month.
Pipes in this place are ancient.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.157
Every time the construction guys
go near them, they burst.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.559
And did you replace
the elevator cables afterwards?

10:59.592 --> 11:00.994
The water corrodes them.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.830
We were gonna do that

11:02.863 --> 11:04.564
after we took care
of the flooding issue.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.800
We're gonna have to go in
from above.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.636
Buck and I should just
go down with the basket.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.238
I'll get the winch.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.640
I'll lock and tag out
the power of the cars.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.208
-This way.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.744
TODD: Mom, the water's
getting higher.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.178
-MARJORIE: Mm-hmm.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.813
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.017
-No, you're doing fine.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.019
-No, I mean, we're only
here because of me.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.856
:
Dad left... because of me.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.190
Oh, no.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.424
You're right, okay?
I'm a screwup.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.026
I-I am, and I'm sorry.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.028
-No.
-I'm sorry.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.097
Listen to me. That is not
why your father left.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.400
Your father left...

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
because he got bored.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.872
Of me and our life

11:44.905 --> 11:46.506
and anything
resembling responsibility.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.442
Is that why you're so mad at me?

11:49.476 --> 11:51.078
Because I'm like him?

11:51.111 --> 11:54.414
You're nothing like him.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.049
You take after me.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.051
-Okay.
-And that's why
I push you so hard.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.452
-Listen to me.
-Okay.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.455
Because I know...
you can be so much more.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.191
CHIMNEY:
Pressure line's ready, Cap.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.226
All right, let's go.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.666
All right, that's good.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.980
-Honey. Honey. Honey.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.615
Uh-huh. Wait. Right here.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.151
-Hello!

12:31.184 --> 12:32.786
-TODD: Thank goodness.
-BUCK: Be right there, guys.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.921
-Watch yourselves.
-MARJORIE: Thank you.

12:33.954 --> 12:34.855
Rope coming in.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.160
-Oh, my... Hi.
-Hey, guys.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.564
My son is,
is right behind me, yes?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.133
-Yes.
-Yeah, I'll be right there.
-Okay.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.567
Don't even worry about it, okay?
I'll be right there.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.069
HEN:
Okay, Bobby.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.971
All right, we're gonna
bring her up. Go ahead, Chim.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.682
BOBBY:
Come right through here.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.251
Just come right through here.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.785
-All right, that's one.
-Thank you.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.487
-You're next.
Okay, let's do this.
-All right.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.990
BUCK: Uh, hey, uh, Bobby,
um, need another harness.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.025
-Coming down.
-Oh.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.663
Hey, the-the weight of the water
is pulling us down.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.532
BOBBY: All right, grab the kid,
get the hell out of there.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.835
Yeah, but we both won't fit.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.171
-I need another harness.
-We can only do
one at a time, Cap.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.006
I don't suppose
you do a lot of pull

13:26.039 --> 13:27.340
What?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.476
That's what I thought.
Okay.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.543
Pull it up.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.779
All right, let's freewheel it.
Come on.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.381
Okay, ready?

13:35.883 --> 13:38.351
We got you, we got you.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.355
All right... all right.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.359
Buck! Buck!

13:46.393 --> 13:47.527
Buck!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.041
Mom?

14:01.074 --> 14:03.043
Hey. Hey.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.811
Is she gonna be all right?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.813
They'll check her out more
at the hospital.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.581
It just seems
like a mild concussion.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.718
You'll just have to keep an eye
on her for the next few days.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.987
We could have died like that.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.757
Trapped together,
full of anger and resentment.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.192
I don't want that.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.062
But we didn't.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.264
They got us out.
We're free, Mom.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.033
No.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.036
I don't mean today.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.671
I mean 20, 30 years together,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.241
stuck with each other
until I draw my last breath.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.410
You need to move out.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.180
But I don't have a job, Ma. I...

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
You will find one.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.485
You proved today that you are
not a helpless idiot.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.968
Okay.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.970
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.605
-You keep on that uniform.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.978
Hmm?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.413
It's a hot day in July.

15:13.446 --> 15:18.651
One of those hundred-degree
So Cal days.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.254
You spot me on La Brea.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.324
I'm driving 90 in a 45.

15:24.357 --> 15:28.661
You hit the siren,
pull me over,

15:28.695 --> 15:32.665
and walk over to my window,
where you lower yourself down.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.069
You make eye contact.

15:36.103 --> 15:40.240
It is so hot
that you unbutton your shirt.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.810
Are you serious?

15:43.843 --> 15:46.346
Have you been smoking something?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.917
Athena,

15:50.950 --> 15:54.587
seeing a woman as beautiful
as you in a police uniform,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.657
it's... mmm.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.127
I'm a strong man.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.829
I run an entire department.

16:02.862 --> 16:06.666
50 people all answering to me.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.003
I'm in control.

16:10.037 --> 16:14.574
So what could be
more sexy to me...

16:16.376 --> 16:20.347
...than a woman strong enough to
take that control away from me?

16:20.380 --> 16:23.350
Mmm.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.853
Mm, well, I've never done
anything like that before.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.688
At least not in the bedroom.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.391
-Mm, mm, mm.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.830
-Sir.
-Ooh.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.068
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to place you under arrest.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.070
On what charges?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.338
Being so damn fine.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.341
Might want
to restrain me, Sergeant.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.911
-I've been a bad, bad boy.
-Ooh.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.815
Don't you want to read me
my rights?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.818
Ooh, you have the right to be
as loud as you like.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.389
-Mmm...

17:02.422 --> 17:05.024
!

17:05.058 --> 17:07.927
You just handcuffed
both of us to the bed.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.263
I thought you were into it.

17:10.297 --> 17:15.068
I was. But the key to the cuffs
is in my belt, on the floor!

17:15.102 --> 17:16.503
AARON:
Oh.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.171
-Damn.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.273
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-Okay.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.211
Maybe you can go over...

17:24.244 --> 17:25.912
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.083
Just wait a minute.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.352
Okay.
-Oh. No.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.121
-No, no. It's... Won't move.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.955
-Hold up, wait.
-Oh! Okay, wait, wait.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.890
-Okay. I have a friend.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.059
He's two houses down.
I'll-I'll just give him a call.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.061
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Uh-uh. No, you won't.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.896
Nobody's coming through
that door that I don't know.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.132
So how we supposed to get free?

17:49.269 --> 17:50.570
Abby.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.139
-Yeah.
-Take line two.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.740
They're asking for you.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.908
They're asking for me?
Through the system?

17:55.942 --> 17:57.444
Yes. Requested you specifically.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.280
More demanded.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.483
911. This is Abby Clark.
What's your emergency?

18:03.516 --> 18:06.486
ATHENA: Hi. Abby, it's Athena.
You recognize my voice?

18:06.519 --> 18:09.088
Oh. Yeah, Athena.
H

18:09.122 --> 18:11.291
Uh, no. Uh, just "Athena."

18:11.324 --> 18:14.894
Okay. Uh, Athena,
wh

18:14.927 --> 18:16.229
Are you on duty?

18:16.263 --> 18:18.798
Uh, this is a personal call.

18:18.831 --> 18:23.770
I, um, seem to have gotten
myself in a-a bit of a jam.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.405
I need you to call Henrietta

18:25.438 --> 18:27.440
and have her call me back
at this number.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.842
Okay. Um, I can do... I don't...

18:29.876 --> 18:31.844
I don't have...
Do you have her number?

18:31.878 --> 18:34.847
It's in my phone, which I don't
have access to at the moment.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.917
-It's okay.
I can ask Buck for it.
-Oh. Oh, fine.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.187
Don't-don't tell him
why you need it.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.355
Okay, I won't. Um...

18:42.389 --> 18:44.791
Are you okay, S... A

18:44.824 --> 18:50.763
I'm in no danger of anything,
except being embarrassed.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
-Okay.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.806
'Thena?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.741
ATHENA:
Hen!

19:06.913 --> 19:08.815
Hen!

19:08.848 --> 19:10.650
Is that you?

19:10.683 --> 19:14.053
What the... the hell?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.955
Hen, um...

19:25.565 --> 19:27.534
Are you done?

19:27.567 --> 19:30.370
Athena, I thought... I don't
know what the hell I thought.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.005
What... You called 911 for this?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.408
911 is the only damn number
I have memorized.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.177
Everything else is in my phone,
which is over there

19:38.211 --> 19:40.713
with my belt and the key.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.350
The key! You need the key?

19:43.383 --> 19:47.354
You called me over here
to walk across the room

19:47.387 --> 19:49.055
to get you the key

19:49.088 --> 19:51.258
-AARON: She wouldn't let me

19:51.291 --> 19:53.493
-call anyone saved in my phone.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
And have one of
your frat boy friends

19:55.528 --> 19:57.163
come over here
and catch me like this?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.400
-You must be out your mind.
-I was never in a frat.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.102
All right, let me...
let me... let me just

20:03.135 --> 20:05.204
-unlock you, then.
-Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.006
Did I ask you to?

20:07.039 --> 20:10.677
Just put it right there
where I can get to it.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.111
Seriously?

20:12.144 --> 20:15.214
Mm-hmm. We good.
You can go.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.450
Mm!

20:17.484 --> 20:19.619
-M'kay. Well, damn!

20:19.652 --> 20:21.254
Get it, girl.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.290
Let me...

20:23.323 --> 20:25.358
Well, I mean, let me just
bring this over here,

20:25.392 --> 20:27.594
just in case y'all want
to get kinky with the Taser.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.429
-Bye, Hen.
Wait, let me just...

20:29.462 --> 20:31.030
I just want to get a selfie...

20:31.063 --> 20:33.433
-No, no. You really need to go!

20:42.442 --> 20:47.414
* I'm in love with it,
intoxicated... *

20:48.981 --> 20:51.250
AUTOMATED VOICE:
In 0.1 miles, keep right.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.185
*

21:04.130 --> 21:06.566
-Hi!
-Hi.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.336
What the heck is this?

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
-It's our date.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.606
-Come on.
-Oh, my gosh!

21:13.640 --> 21:16.175
Hi.
Hi.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.346
-These are for you.
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.381
So beautiful.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.452
-Whoa!
-Uh-huh.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.119
-No.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.255
: Oh, my...

21:29.288 --> 21:32.258
Uh, no,
but I've answered a few calls

21:32.291 --> 21:33.826
from ones that have crashed.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.796
I'm just kidding.
It's amazing.

21:36.829 --> 21:40.800
And, uh, there is
champagne and truffles on board.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.470
-You're surprising me.
-Well, you're amazing.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.105
I want to make sure
I make you feel that way.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.875
So, today, we fly.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.310
-Awesome. Awesome.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.812
-Oh, shoot.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.213
Hold on one second. Sorry.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.282
My mom.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.618
-Here, let me take these.
-Oh, yes. Hold on. Thank you.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.354
-CARLA: Hey. I-I'm so sorry,
sweetheart.

22:01.388 --> 22:05.324
-Okay. All right.
She's having another episode.
-Car...

22:05.358 --> 22:07.727
-Carla, Carla, maybe put her

22:07.760 --> 22:09.962
-Here, okay, l-listen, listen.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.330
-Listen, listen.
-Abby!

22:11.364 --> 22:12.899
There's Abby on the phone.
-Mom.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.167
It's Abby.
Can you hear me?
-She's right here.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.069
-PATRICIA: Why are you
keeping me prisoner?

22:17.103 --> 22:19.205
-CARLA: I think she needs
to see your face.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.207
-She needs to know you're here.
-ABBY: All right.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.544
Carla, I'll-I'll just be there
as fast as I can, okay?

22:24.577 --> 22:25.845
Okay.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.017
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.253
Uh, hot air balloon.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.723
I know, I know.
It's my mom. Sh...

22:36.756 --> 22:38.725
But it's a hot air balloon,
you know? You can't just...

22:38.758 --> 22:41.594
-reschedule that like
a dinner reservation.
-I know.

22:41.628 --> 22:44.431
We had a really bad night,
and she's just...

22:44.464 --> 22:47.199
just in a terrible place
right now.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.736
-No, it's fine.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.204
Thank you.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.541
Thanks. I'm sorry.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.543
-Bye.
-Bye.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.383
You want to give me
a lift to work?!

23:08.821 --> 23:10.790
Thought you had the morning off.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.460
Weren't you supposed to be
up in a blimp or something?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.895
Hot air balloon.
And, uh, she bailed on me.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.930
Uh, her mom wasn't doing well.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.566
That's a bummer. Happens.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.001
Yeah. I don't know.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.440
Look, I'm-I'm super into her.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.276
You know, she is...
she's really smart.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.480
And when she makes fun of me,
it doesn't make me feel bad.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.315
She has her own money.
The sex is... insane.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.417
Oh, here I thought
she just had great hair.

23:38.451 --> 23:41.220
:
She's the perfect woman.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.322
But this is
the second week in a row

23:43.355 --> 23:45.958
that my day off
has been screwed up

23:45.992 --> 23:48.294
because she has to go
and deal with her mom.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.764
Well, people who are great
tend to have full lives,

23:51.798 --> 23:53.432
with people who depend on them.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.603
Yeah. And-and I really like
her mom, you know?

23:56.636 --> 23:59.772
I-I do. And I respect the way
that Abby takes care of her.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.010
I'm-I'm starting to think
maybe...

24:06.312 --> 24:08.948
...maybe this kind
of relationship isn't for me.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.750
You mean a real one?

24:10.783 --> 24:14.320
I'm... I mean, I'm 26, right?

24:14.353 --> 24:16.322
You know, I-I want to have fun.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.290
You know? And I'm not saying
that I should go

24:18.324 --> 24:20.593
and start jumping back into bed
with every girl I meet.

24:20.627 --> 24:23.429
I'm-I'm not trying
to be that guy anymore.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.431
But maybe I should
find something

24:25.464 --> 24:28.935
that is a little less...

24:28.968 --> 24:31.137
adult.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.673
Look, all those things that
you feel when you're with Abby--

24:33.706 --> 24:36.375
the closeness,
intimacy and trust--

24:36.408 --> 24:38.978
those things
don't come for free.

24:39.011 --> 24:42.348
Any woman of substance
and experience has lived a life,

24:42.381 --> 24:44.350
and she's gonna
come with some baggage.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.053
I think your problem is
you're hoping

24:47.086 --> 24:50.823
to pull her out of this trap
she's in with her mom.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.525
That's not gonna happen.

24:52.559 --> 24:56.062
What she needs is
for you to step inside with her,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.397
keep her company in there.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.678
CECIL:
What took you so long?

25:11.711 --> 25:13.846
It takes as long
as it takes, Cecil.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.848
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Are-are you sure

25:15.882 --> 25:17.750
-Yes, I'm sure.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.920
How sure? Winslow.
Winslow, how sure?

25:20.953 --> 25:23.189
-I'm very sure!
-That's good.
That's-that's very good.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.191
Circled the block three times.
I'm sure.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.860
Did you... did you get
the bread, Winslow?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.432
Winslow?

25:33.465 --> 25:35.534
-I think my jacket's sn...
-Don't... Wins...

25:35.568 --> 25:37.369
-Be careful. Don't...
-...snagged on something.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.304
Winslow!

26:02.561 --> 26:05.064
-Buck, get the saw.
-Yes, Cap.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.208
Dispatch said something about
the house being booby-trapped.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.044
We have to take the door.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.546
Here you go, Cap.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.498
Oh, easy, Cap. Easy.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.435
CHIMNEY:
What on earth?

26:43.469 --> 26:44.971
HEN:
We're never getting past that.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.840
Not unless we have
a bulldozer in the truck.

26:47.874 --> 26:51.277
-1968.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.316
CHIMNEY: Here, hand it to me.
Hand it to me.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.551
What is that, a tunnel?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.256
BETSY:
They're total kooks.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.259
Hoarders on steroids.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.797
One I actually never seen.
Never leaves the house.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.200
The other, you know,
every once in a while,

27:14.233 --> 27:16.035
you'll see him skulking
around the neighborhood,

27:16.068 --> 27:19.005
goes out for groceries
or newspapers.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.841
And he circles the block
three times

27:21.874 --> 27:23.843
before disappearing
into the house.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.113
It's like he's, uh, afraid
someone's following him.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.717
Trust me,
no one's following him.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.653
Same thing round back.
Window's our best choice.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.824
I wouldn't be so sure
about that. Heads up!

27:40.659 --> 27:43.996
Damn, this is insane!
Hey, Cap, you got to see this!

27:45.664 --> 27:47.299
-BOBBY: Buck! Buck!

27:49.668 --> 27:53.239
-Buck!

27:53.272 --> 27:56.075
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

27:56.108 --> 28:00.379
I told you. Kooks!

28:00.412 --> 28:02.314
ABBY: Okay, Cecil,
the fire captain is on the line.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.051
-He'd like to speak
with you, okay?
-CECIL: Yes.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.919
Yes, o-okay. All right.

28:06.953 --> 28:10.022
Captain Nash, his name is Cecil.
He's older. He seems fragile.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.258
He's probably gonna require
some patience.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.861
-Of course.
-Captain Nash,
this is Cecil Farrier.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.529
His brother is the one
who's trapped.

28:17.563 --> 28:20.099
Cecil, my name is Bobby.
I'm outside your place,

28:20.132 --> 28:21.868
and I'm gonna help find
your brother.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.502
We need to pick a window,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.071
and you need to disarm
the traps.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.873
-I can't.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.941
I'm blind.

28:28.975 --> 28:31.911
Okay, well, Cecil, what's
the best way into the house?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.412
Through the back tunnel,

28:33.445 --> 28:35.414
b-but I think
that's totally collapsed.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.918
So there's only one way in:
the-the front tunnel.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.587
BOBBY: How far back
does this tunnel go?

28:41.620 --> 28:43.790
Maybe... 25 feet.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.225
Stay to the right.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.627
Just about halfway down,
there's-there's a trap.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.296
What happens if I trip it?

28:50.329 --> 28:52.298
Uh, Winslow rigged
a-a circular saw blade

28:52.331 --> 28:54.133
to-to fall through
one of the cracks.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.802
It would cut you right in two.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.637
You disarm that,
you disarm all the booby traps.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.639
I can talk you through it.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.877
Just please, please hurry.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.212
What do you think, Buck?

29:06.245 --> 29:11.317
I'm game, but...
I don't think I'll fit.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.053
I would.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.089
Come out to the coast, we'll get
together, have a few laughs.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.791
BUCK:
What's that, Chim?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.993
You make me sad, Buck.

29:21.027 --> 29:24.263
Very sad.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.764
-Come on.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.312
Okay, Cecil, I'm at the clock.
What now?

29:40.346 --> 29:42.915
CECIL:
Is

29:42.949 --> 29:44.683
Copy. It's set to midnight.

29:44.716 --> 29:49.155
So... move it to 11:11.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.157
Copy.

29:51.190 --> 29:55.527
Turn the clock to ease
the tension on the trip wire.

29:55.561 --> 29:59.265
Remember, that clock can set off
other traps in the house.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.766
You all right?

30:00.799 --> 30:03.836
-CHIMNEY: I'm good. I'm good.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.472
Setting the clock to 11:11.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.142
-Nice and easy, now.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.011
Slowly.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.816
It's at 11:11!

30:22.654 --> 30:24.656
All clear.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.128
Cecil, can you hear me?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.829
CECIL:
Hello?

30:30.863 --> 30:33.499
-Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.501
-Oh, God.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.839
-Oh, my God.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.009
Where

30:43.042 --> 30:44.877
-Coming. I'm coming.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.146
Good. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.348
Now-now you have to help me
find my brother.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.350
-Okay, I will, I will,
I will, I will.
-Yeah, help. Yeah.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.751
-I promise you I will.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.420
Uh, just stay here
for one second, okay?

30:54.453 --> 30:56.322
I'm just gonna let some light
in here so I can see.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.524
Don't move.
-Okay.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.692
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.929
How long have you been
living like this?

31:02.962 --> 31:06.065
Not sure what you mean. Uh...

31:06.098 --> 31:08.234
Winslow and me--
we took the house

31:08.267 --> 31:10.002
-after Mom and Dad died.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.503
So, 1967, and...

31:11.537 --> 31:14.540
Well, we had to protect
the house, you know?

31:14.573 --> 31:17.409
We-we wanted to make sure
that nobody stole anything.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.381
It's our house.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.550
: It's our
house, and we had to protect it,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.185
and I can't do this by myself,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.120
so I need you
to help me find him right now.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.721
I need you to stop
what you're doing

31:29.755 --> 31:31.958
-and help me find him right now!
-I will. I will.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.293
I promise you I'm gonna find
your brother for you, okay?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.761
But I need you
to stay right here

31:35.794 --> 31:37.229
so I can go get him, all right?

31:37.263 --> 31:38.597
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.432
-Okay. Okay.
-I'll be back.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.269
-I'll be back for you.
-Okay. Find... find him.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.571
Okay. Find him.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.440
*

32:04.957 --> 32:07.459
Over here! He's here! Winslow!

32:07.493 --> 32:09.128
You're gonna be all right, sir.
We got you.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.663
Just try to keep still.
Grab my bag!

32:11.697 --> 32:14.166
-CHIMNEY: Cecil, he's okay.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.568
We're gonna take care
of you now. Please stay still.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.604
-Okay.
-All right.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.473
Ready? One, two, three!

32:21.507 --> 32:24.143
-Flip!
-Ow!

32:24.176 --> 32:25.911
HEN: All right,
I see some blood down here.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.213
Let me check it out, you guys.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.849
All right, just keep...

32:30.882 --> 32:33.019
-Ooh.
-Okay.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.587
All right, hold on. We got
a compound fractured tibia,

32:35.621 --> 32:37.456
penetrated to the skin.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.691
A slight discoloration
below the break.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.661
-BOBBY: Okay,
check the dorsalis pedis pulse.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.664
-All right, sir.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.633
-I'm not finding anything.
-He could lose his leg.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.935
All right, we have to realign
it, reestablish blood flow.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.471
Okay, Buck, you and I stabilize.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.840
Hen, Chim, do your thing.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.708
Winslow, sorry.
This is gonna hurt.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.711
All right, hold him still.
Hen, on three.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.947
-One, two, three!

33:01.980 --> 33:04.016
-All right. All right.
-Keep your leg still!
Keep your leg still!

33:04.050 --> 33:06.485
Hard part's over. Now we got
to get you to the hospital.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.721
-Okay, guys, strap him in.
-No, no, no!

33:09.755 --> 33:11.657
I-I can't leave...
I can't leave my brother!

33:11.690 --> 33:13.159
You're doing great.
Stay still.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.726
-Hey. Yeah.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.662
HEN: We're gonna get you
out of here, sir.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.664
-You're gonna be fine, Winslow.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.199
-One, two, three, up!

33:20.232 --> 33:23.069
-All right.
-HEN: Somebody grab
my gear on the way out!

33:23.102 --> 33:25.471
-Winslow, it's okay. I'm here.
-Easy, easy, easy.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.840
-BOBBY: Good job, guys.
All right, keep going.
-WINSLOW: No!

33:28.874 --> 33:30.976
No! I can't leave. Please,
I can't leave my brother behind.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.978
I'm here. I'm here, Winslow.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.081
Just... I'm here.
Just let them take care of you.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.882
I won't leave you, Cecil.

33:36.915 --> 33:39.751
CECIL: You don't have to.
You don't have to.

33:43.622 --> 33:48.427
I'm... I'm-I'm coming with you.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.330
-* Sunny
-Yeah.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.832
* Yesterday my life
was filled with rain... *

33:53.865 --> 33:55.834
Um, you got
to help my brother now.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.603
-He's fine. He's fine.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.339
All right, Winslow, come on.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.209
* Smiled at me
and really eased the pain... *

34:03.242 --> 34:04.943
-I'm here. I'm here.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.379
* Oh, the dark days are gone

34:07.413 --> 34:09.748
* And the bright days are here

34:09.781 --> 34:13.519
-* My Sunny one shines
so sincere *

34:13.552 --> 34:16.788
* Oh, Sunny one so true

34:16.822 --> 34:17.989
* I love you.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.966
Is this cool?
Like, I figured we try someplace

34:27.999 --> 34:30.702
completely not special,
so-so if you had to cancel it,

34:30.736 --> 34:33.472
-you wouldn't feel bad.
-I'm sorry.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.910
This is great.
This is great.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.147
Um, so how's your mom doing?

34:41.180 --> 34:43.482
Same. I mean, worse.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.152
You know, she's having
a hard time walking,

34:46.185 --> 34:49.921
and eating is getting tougher.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.823
But the worst part,
you know, is, like,

34:51.857 --> 34:54.460
it's just the memory
and the personality.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.295
But this disease-- it doesn't

34:56.328 --> 34:58.830
just eat away at it
like cancer does.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.999
It almost just pushes it away.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.769
Yeah, and, um...

35:03.802 --> 35:07.005
it sounds, it sounds... awful.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.007
: Sorry.
I know, it sounds awful.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.976
And I'm sure
you don't want to hear it,

35:11.009 --> 35:12.578
'cause I don't want to hear it

35:12.611 --> 35:14.613
'cause I don't even want
to be going through it.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.349
-I-I do want to hear it.
-Well...

35:17.383 --> 35:19.318
All right, you're-you're
living it, and I want,

35:19.351 --> 35:21.953
-I want you to talk to me.
-I know, but it's just...

35:21.987 --> 35:24.590
I think there's a reason
I've been doing this...

35:24.623 --> 35:26.192
alone, you know?

35:26.225 --> 35:29.628
It's hard to drag somebody
through it.

35:31.663 --> 35:35.467
I don't want... you know.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.336
I don't want that for you.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.673
You're breaking up
with me, right?

35:41.707 --> 35:44.810
I think I just...
I'm letting you off the hook.

35:44.843 --> 35:48.480
See, I feel like
anyone else, most people,

35:48.514 --> 35:50.682
if they were
dealing with the stuff

35:50.716 --> 35:52.684
you have to deal with
every single day,

35:52.718 --> 35:56.822
they would, they would
see it as a cage.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.824
But you don't.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.160
You find a way to break free.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.696
You find a way to be yourself.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.865
You find... life.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.702
And if the price I have to pay

36:10.736 --> 36:13.639
for being close to a woman
like you is, yeah, whatever,

36:13.672 --> 36:16.575
a couple of canceled dates,
then, you know what?

36:16.608 --> 36:20.212
Then that is one heck
of a good deal, and I am in.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.781
I'm not going anywhere.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.555
AARON:
Now,

36:29.588 --> 36:32.824
for the star of the show.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.093
Ah.

36:37.128 --> 36:39.265
Duck rendang.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.166
ATHENA:
Wow.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.237
-That's a good-looking duck.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

36:45.271 --> 36:49.040
I bet your, uh, ex-husband
wasn't a gourmet chef

36:49.074 --> 36:50.542
in his spare time.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.444
Actually,
Michael's a great cook.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.881
Mm. There's great, and then
there's duck rendang great.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.116
-Mm-hmm.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.224
I want to run something by you.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.059
I have a place in Big Sur.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.796
I was thinking that
we can get away for the weekend,

37:10.829 --> 37:13.399
hike, go on the beach.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.434
No.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.636
I can't go away with you.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.471
I'm not even divorced yet.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.640
It's a formality.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.110
No. It's not.

37:25.143 --> 37:28.113
I just got out of
a 14-year marriage

37:28.146 --> 37:31.249
to a guy I thought I knew.

37:31.283 --> 37:35.287
I'm figuring out
how to be single at 50.

37:35.321 --> 37:39.157
I'm not looking to jump
into another relationship.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.260
I want sex with no strings.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.964
I don't need dinners
or weekend getaways.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.604
I got married because
my biological clock was ticking.

37:52.638 --> 37:56.642
I stayed married for the kids.

37:56.675 --> 38:01.747
I'm getting divorced for myself.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.449
I'm not ready for this.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.851
And you...

38:07.986 --> 38:11.990
You are too good
to be somebody's rebound guy.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.960
Okay.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.596
I assume you're not gonna
stay the night, then?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.598
Well...

38:19.631 --> 38:21.867
-that depends...
-Mm-hmm.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.703
...on how good the duck is.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.479
Uh, my lawyer says
we're not supposed to talk.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.481
Did you tell him
that the only reason

38:35.514 --> 38:38.384
you're doing all of this is
so that you and I will talk?

38:38.417 --> 38:39.985
He is my son, too.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.454
'Cause I carried him,
I gave birth to him.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.322
And you couldn't sign
those papers to give him away

38:44.356 --> 38:45.891
fast enough, Eva.
This isn't about Denny.

38:45.924 --> 38:49.628
It's about you finding a way
to get back with me.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.565
:
Well, what's wrong with that?

38:53.599 --> 38:56.067
I mean, we could give him
a better family.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.569
Me and you, together.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.571
He ha a family.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.874
Now, I know
that Diesel is the reason

39:02.908 --> 39:04.976
that you stayed with her
all these years.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.479
Her name is Karen.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.481
And I love her.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.850
But she's got you trapped,

39:11.883 --> 39:15.687
living this sad, suburban life
that is not you,

39:15.721 --> 39:17.689
but when I get custody...

39:17.723 --> 39:20.025
You know that's never
gonna happen.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.160
So tell me...

39:22.193 --> 39:25.431
what do we have to do
to make you stop this insanity?

39:25.464 --> 39:27.599
What, you need money?

39:27.633 --> 39:30.068
We don't got a lot, but, what,
that's what it's gonna take?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.073
I want you.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.744
You had me, Eva.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.346
You had me.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.415
I loved you.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.417
I would've done
anything for you.

39:45.451 --> 39:49.254
That wasn't enough.
I wasn't enough.

39:49.287 --> 39:53.058
See, you have this fantasy
of us playing house,

39:53.091 --> 39:57.429
as if I hadn't already
lived through that.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.598
:
I know how it goes.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.633
I know how it goes.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.637
It's me trying over and over
and over to build a life for us,

40:05.671 --> 40:09.074
and you tearing it down
brick by brick by brick

40:09.107 --> 40:13.378
until I'm left alone,
heartbroken,

40:13.411 --> 40:17.315
in a hole that I don't even know
how to climb out of.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.722
I survived you, Eva.

40:23.755 --> 40:28.126
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
let you put Denny through this.

40:29.595 --> 40:30.762
Wait.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.834
Just wait.

40:35.867 --> 40:39.671
Okay, it won't be
like that this time.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.540
Oh, I can be different.

40:43.709 --> 40:47.846
Being in that cage--
it changed me.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.380
I love you.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.752
:
I love you.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.454
You are incapable

40:56.488 --> 40:58.857
of caring about anybody
but yourself,

40:58.890 --> 41:04.429
which is why I will never
let you near my son.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.997
Count on that.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.735
Count on it!

41:14.540 --> 41:19.811
ABBY: A wolf will chew off
its own leg just to escape.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.447
("I of the Storm"
by Of Monsters and Men playing)

41:22.480 --> 41:24.482
Which makes perfect sense.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.118
* If I could face them

41:27.152 --> 41:31.156
* If I could make amends
with all my shadows... *

41:31.189 --> 41:33.158
If you're being held back,

41:33.191 --> 41:37.162
cornered,
forced into a situation,

41:37.195 --> 41:40.365
you do whatever you can
to change it,

41:40.398 --> 41:43.368
to break free, to survive.

41:43.401 --> 41:46.538
* But I feel it burning

41:46.572 --> 41:51.309
* Like when the winter wind
stops my breathing... *

41:51.342 --> 41:55.246
But sometimes escape
isn't our default.

41:55.280 --> 41:59.484
* I fear you won't,
I fear you don't... *

41:59.517 --> 42:02.320
Sometimes we stay the course.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.223
We cope, we navigate.

42:05.256 --> 42:09.761
* And it echoes when I breathe,
till all you see... *

42:09.795 --> 42:13.498
Because traps don't look
the same to everybody,

42:13.531 --> 42:15.366
especially not from inside one.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.036
* Empty vessel,
crooked teeth... *

42:18.069 --> 42:21.773
Sometimes what the rest of the
world sees as having us pinned

42:21.807 --> 42:25.677
actually ends up
pushing us forward,

42:25.711 --> 42:31.149
giving us purpose, control,
someone to talk to.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.759
And once in a while,

42:40.792 --> 42:43.695
the very thing everyone thinks
is holding us back

42:43.729 --> 42:47.633
is also
what makes us feel at home.

42:49.467 --> 42:52.103
* With all my thoughts...

42:52.137 --> 42:54.072
:
Mom?

42:59.611 --> 43:03.581
* I feel it biting,
I feel it break my skin *

43:03.615 --> 43:05.216
:
Mom.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.786
* So uninviting

43:07.819 --> 43:10.455
* Are you really gonna need me
when I'm gone? *

43:10.488 --> 43:12.090
:
Mom?

43:12.123 --> 43:14.592
* And they call me under

43:14.626 --> 43:17.228
Mom?!

43:17.262 --> 43:21.099
* And I'm shaking like a leaf

43:21.132 --> 43:22.734
:
Mom?!

43:22.768 --> 43:27.605
* And they call me underneath

43:27.639 --> 43:30.475
-* To the storm.

to check out from Fox.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.059
Family is everything.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.194
I grew up
in the south of France.

44:23.228 --> 44:25.030
My mother
was a dressmaker.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.532
My father was
a Philippine general.

44:27.565 --> 44:30.235
The first dress I ever made
was for my sister.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.903
I have a doctorate
from Yale.

44:31.937 --> 44:33.671
I design
from the heart.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.406
I build ocean liners.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.375
Art...

44:37.408 --> 44:39.210
is the passion
of my life.

44:39.244 --> 44:41.379
When I see
something I want...

44:42.380 --> 44:43.749
I take it.

44:43.782 --> 44:46.051
The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

44:46.084 --> 44:48.386
All new,

Every day we encounter people

44:57.528 --> 45:00.098
This is a family.

45:00.131 --> 45:02.067
We work side-by-side.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.269
-Hustle up.

45:04.302 --> 45:08.139
