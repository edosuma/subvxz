your choice.

12:19.139 --> 12:23.074
Please, enjoy our little
corner of Equestria.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.509
We're all quite fond of it.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.312
No doubt you will be as well.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.148
Double Diamond, please
help our guests

12:30.150 --> 12:31.683
with whatever they
might need.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.051
Of course.

12:37.289 --> 12:40.425
Well, this will certainly
provide a boost

12:40.427 --> 12:42.660
to our little community.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.395
When the rest of Equestria sees

12:44.397 --> 12:47.766
that a princess gave up
her Cutie Mark to join us,

12:47.768 --> 12:51.669
they'll finally understand what
we're trying to accomplish.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.242
Welcome!

12:57.244 --> 12:58.443
Welcome!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.611
Welcome!

12:59.745 --> 13:01.312
A Cutie Mark is
a representation

13:01.314 --> 13:03.314
of a pony's unique
talents and skills.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.616
How is it possible to--

13:04.618 --> 13:07.685
[gasp] What in the name
of Equestria is THAT?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.721
Welcome!

13:09.723 --> 13:12.023
Care to sample
some local fashion?

13:12.025 --> 13:14.292
We've got cloaks this month!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.728
[gag]

13:16.730 --> 13:21.766
Perhaps another time,
good sir, thank you.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.772
No wonder nopony's
wearing anything.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.241
Really, girls, they may do
things a bit differently

13:30.243 --> 13:33.244
than we're used to, but that's
no reason to be rude!

13:33.246 --> 13:35.747
No, the reason to be rude

13:35.749 --> 13:37.148
is that they all
keep staring at us.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.552
Need something?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.055
Uh, no, we're good.
Fluttershy's right.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.690
If we're going to
get to the bottom

13:45.692 --> 13:47.325
of why the map sent us here,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.227
we'll need the
help of these ponies.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.396
I think we ran off to
the end of Equestria

13:51.398 --> 13:53.431
before we even knew
what that map was!

13:53.433 --> 13:55.233
If we were at the
end of Equestria,

13:55.235 --> 13:57.402
we'd be sitting on
a big A!

13:57.404 --> 13:58.758
Hee Hee! Get it?

13:58.760 --> 14:01.706
Oh please, Miss Pie, this is
hardly the time for jokes.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.242
We've come all this
way and for what?

14:04.244 --> 14:06.978
Maybe you're right,
but we're here now.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.314
And it sure feels like
something's wrong.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.516
That and two bits'll
get you a cup of cider.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.418
Is this a bad time?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.719
We shouldn't be
bickering like this

14:14.721 --> 14:16.719
in front of our
new friends.

14:16.721 --> 14:19.524
Really, Applejack, you're
almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!

14:19.526 --> 14:21.326
Don't drag me
into this.

14:22.761 --> 14:24.762
Is your friendship ending?

14:24.764 --> 14:26.762
Are you crazy?

14:26.764 --> 14:29.300
We'd never let a disagreement
get in the way of food!

14:29.302 --> 14:32.470
OK, well. My
name is Sugar Belle.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.172
What can I bring you?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.707
We have muffins...

14:41.480 --> 14:45.016
Then I guess we'll
take six muffins.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.484
Make that twelve.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.653
What? I'm hungry.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.456
Come on, girls, we've
got to stick together.

14:51.458 --> 14:55.126
It doesn't matter what happened
before; we're here now.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.694
I guess you're right.

14:56.696 --> 15:01.165
And the sooner we figure out
why, the sooner we can go home.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.600
Forgive me for
overhearing,

15:02.602 --> 15:05.503
but just a moment ago
you were disagreeing.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.439
And now it sounds
like you're agreeing.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.208
Uh-huh.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.377
Well, you had such
differing opinions.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.678
And Cutie Marks.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.181
We have differing opinions
all the time, darling.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.584
But you look like
you're friends.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.253
A simple disagreement
wouldn't change that.

15:23.989 --> 15:29.027
I'm sorry, I'm just having
a hard time understanding.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.161
Different talents lead
to different opinions,

15:30.163 --> 15:32.297
which lead to
bitterness and misery.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.699
So, why aren't you
bitter and--

15:34.701 --> 15:36.467
Peh!

15:36.469 --> 15:38.303
Blech!

15:38.305 --> 15:42.640
Mmm...good!

15:42.642 --> 15:45.710
It's all right, I know
I'm not a very good baker.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.479
At least, I'm not any
better than anypony else

15:48.481 --> 15:50.548
in the village.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.486
Well, I hope you enjoy
our little village!

15:57.056 --> 15:58.456
Come inside before you go.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.325
Meet me downstairs.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.699
OK, that was weird, too.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.135
Let's all sit here and eat
these muffins and act normal.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.204
I think we're being watched.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.142
Ya think?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.142
No, not like that.

16:20.144 --> 16:23.613
I mean somepony here doesn't
want us talking to Sugar Belle.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.619
I got an idea.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.655
But you gotta eat all
them muffins, Pinkie.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.024
Me? Why me?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.659
You got a stronger
stomach than any of us

16:34.661 --> 16:37.595
and that filly in there
might be our best chance

16:37.597 --> 16:39.731
at findin' out what in the
hay is goin' on around here.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.514
Applejack: I can't believe you
ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie!

16:56.516 --> 17:00.418
We'd best go inside
and get some more!

17:00.420 --> 17:02.553
Nice work, Pinkie.

17:05.290 --> 17:09.594
I've accidentally eaten
cardboard tastier than that.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.263
Hello? Sugar Belle?

17:12.265 --> 17:13.564
Sugar Belle: Thank
you for coming.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.136
Why did want us
to come down here?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.738
So nopony could see
what's about to happen.

17:20.740 --> 17:27.211
<i>♪ [eerie] </i>

17:27.213 --> 17:30.448
Are you really the
Princess of Friendship?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.183
Do you know Princess Celestia?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.619
I love your Cutie Mark!

17:34.621 --> 17:37.155
How can you be friends with
different Cutie Marks?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.723
Don't you end up
hating each other?

17:38.725 --> 17:42.360
Oh, look at this one!
This one's great too!

17:42.362 --> 17:44.295
I'd love to have my
special talent back,

17:44.297 --> 17:47.265
even just for a day...make
something besides those

17:47.267 --> 17:49.333
disgusting muffins.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.735
So what's stopping you?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.703
Go get your Cutie
Marks back.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.239
Daydreaming is one
thing, but you mean...

17:55.241 --> 17:57.575
actually having
it put back on?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.710
That seems extreme.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.114
I'm not sure Starlight
would like that.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.683
She wants us all to be
happy in our sameness.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.986
How do you take somepony's
Cutie Mark, anyway?

18:08.988 --> 18:12.690
The Cutie Unmarking is
a beautiful experience.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.226
Starlight uses the
Staff of Sameness

18:15.228 --> 18:19.230
to magically take them away
and replace them with these.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.967
But nopony should keep
you from your Cutie Mark.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.636
It represents such an
essential part of who you are!

18:25.638 --> 18:27.472
Oh, we're not kept from them.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.607
They're in the vault,
up in the caves.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.742
We can visit them any time
we like to remind us

18:31.744 --> 18:35.746
of the heartache of a life
with special talents.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.650
Can we visit this cave?

18:42.354 --> 18:45.990
I'm delighted you're interested
in our Cutie Mark vault!

18:45.992 --> 18:49.260
We hope someday every pony in
Equestria will make a pilgrimage

18:49.262 --> 18:53.664
here to our little village
to have theirs removed, too,

18:53.666 --> 18:55.233
[continues]

18:55.235 --> 18:57.034
This must be the
reason we're here.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.370
Pilgrimaging?

18:59.372 --> 19:02.206
No, helping those ponies
get their Cutie Marks back.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.574
Oh. Are you sure, Twilight?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.209
Maybe they missed
them a little,

19:05.211 --> 19:07.578
but even they didn't
seem all that unhappy.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.014
Then why did they want
to meet us in secret?

19:10.016 --> 19:12.183
And why did they ask us
not to tell Starlight

19:12.185 --> 19:13.551
who told us about the vault?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.586
Something's not right.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.688
Just through here!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.326
Behold!

19:25.631 --> 19:28.332
Our Cutie Mark vault.

19:31.537 --> 19:34.405
Twilight: I've never seen
anything like it!

19:34.407 --> 19:38.476
And here is the
Staff of Sameness.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.012
It was one of the great
mage Meadowbrook's

19:41.014 --> 19:43.080
nine enchanted items.

19:43.082 --> 19:46.083
We are incredibly
fortunate to have it here.

19:46.085 --> 19:49.187
This is the tool that allows
us to free ourselves

19:49.189 --> 19:51.289
from our Marks.

19:51.291 --> 19:56.294
I'm curious; how did the
subject of the vault come up?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.995
Oh, some ponies
were telling us

19:57.997 --> 19:59.597
how much they missed
their Cutie Marks and--

19:59.599 --> 20:00.631
Pinkie!

20:00.633 --> 20:01.732
Oops.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.035
Starlight: Were they!

20:04.037 --> 20:08.172
Well, it seems you inspire
all sorts of free thinking,

20:08.174 --> 20:09.707
don't you?

20:09.709 --> 20:13.611

cause any disruptions

to your charming
little--

20:15.081 --> 20:16.214
