00:00.333 --> 00:01.333
Adult adam:
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

00:01.335 --> 00:02.868
<i>Mothers and daughters</i>
<i>have always fought.</i>

00:02.870 --> 00:04.737
10:00 is an
embarrassing curfew.

00:04.739 --> 00:06.472
Oh, it's embarrassing
to tell your girlfriends

00:06.474 --> 00:08.707
You'd like to hang out
at a safer time?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.242
<i>A lot.</i>
<i>Ugh!</i>

00:10.244 --> 00:10.776
Absolutely not.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.177
<i>Doesn't matter</i>
<i>what the topic is,</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:15.748
<i>They'll find a way</i>
<i>to disagree strongly</i>
<i>and dramatically.</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:16.982
<i>And when that</i>
<i>runs its course,</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:19.284
<i>They'll just lob</i>
<i>insults at each other.</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:20.452
This house sucks!

00:20.454 --> 00:21.787
<i>It became the background</i>
<i>noise of our lives.</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:24.556
<i>And soon, it became weird</i>
<i>when they weren't fighting.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.058
There's nothing wrong
with this outfit.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.593
They keep it
very hot in the gym.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.294
<i>It was a vicious,</i>
<i>never-ending war.</i>

00:29.296 --> 00:32.965
<i>All we knew was to keep</i>
<i>our heads low and out</i>
<i>of the line of fire.</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:34.033
You're not going.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.301
<i>In a nutshell,</i>
<i>all of their fights</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:37.436
<i>Boiled down to one thing.</i>

00:37.438 --> 00:40.139
Ugh! Why can't you
ever just trust me?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.874
I do trust you!

00:41.876 --> 00:42.508
<i>She didn't.</i>

00:42.510 --> 00:44.743
<i>And to be fair,</i>
<i>she didn't have</i>
<i>any reason to.</i>

00:44.745 --> 00:46.578
No, lainey,
it's not hard to
get wine coolers.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.514
We'll just stand outside
the liquor store

00:48.516 --> 00:50.282
And target the
creepy old dudes.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.650
(gasping)  <i>no!</i>

00:51.652 --> 00:53.085
Mom?

00:53.087 --> 00:56.121
I picked up the
phone by accident,
but I heard everything.

00:56.123 --> 00:59.858
<i>And then came the thing</i>
<i>she lived to say.</i>

00:59.860 --> 01:02.628
I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.397
<i>Erica was</i>
<i>smart and sneaky</i>
<i>in her own right,</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:08.267
<i>So my mom had to</i>
<i>bring her "a" game.</i>

01:08.269 --> 01:10.269
<i>She read her diary.</i>

01:10.271 --> 01:12.604
<i>And when she realized</i>
<i>it was just a decoy</i>

01:12.606 --> 01:14.073
<i>Planted there</i>
<i>for her to read,</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:16.108
<i>She'd find her real diary.</i>

01:16.110 --> 01:17.443
<i>And she wasn't afraid</i>
<i>to get down and dirty</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:21.513
<i>To find out what was</i>
<i>going on even when</i>
<i>nothing was going on.</i>

01:21.515 --> 01:23.549
No, you're still
conjugating it wrong.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.417
It's  <i>j'aime danser.</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:27.586
(snoring in distance)

01:27.854 --> 01:29.254
What's that sound?

01:29.256 --> 01:31.190
(snoring continues)

01:31.192 --> 01:34.860
I think it's snoring.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.297
Seriously?
Nope.

01:38.299 --> 01:38.897
(scoffs)

01:38.899 --> 01:43.335
I mean,
if you're gonna spy,
at least try to stay awake.

01:44.270 --> 01:48.173
Well, in my defense,
that was very boring.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.408
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:49.410 --> 01:53.846
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:56.715
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

01:56.717 --> 02:00.285
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:02.621
Adult adam:  <i>It was</i>
<i>February 6, 1980-something,</i>

02:02.623 --> 02:05.324
<i>And while erica</i>
<i>was my mother's main focus,</i>

02:05.326 --> 02:07.659
<i>She still had time</i>
<i>to aggravate barry, too.</i>

02:07.661 --> 02:09.128
I'm not exaggerating!

02:09.130 --> 02:10.996
This is literally
the worst decision

02:10.998 --> 02:12.865
Any parent has made
on this planet

02:12.867 --> 02:15.400
And any other planet
capable of sustaining life.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.504
You're not having
a girl in your room,
end of argument.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.273
Lexy bloom is
just my lab partner.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.509
All we're
gonna do is study.
We're just friends.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.478
Okay. Then you can study
right here at the table.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.212
Here?

02:27.214 --> 02:28.113
How am I
supposed to impress her

02:28.115 --> 02:31.250
With dad strolling around
in his underpants?

02:31.252 --> 02:31.583
Aha!

02:31.585 --> 02:34.019
You are trying
to get romantic with her.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.854
Of course I am!

02:35.856 --> 02:38.157
Romance pumps
in my veins.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.324
Haven't you heard
my rap ballad

02:39.326 --> 02:42.928
About stone-cold
grooving with a chick
on a ferris wheel?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.062
I have.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.797
It was wonderful.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.865
Not changing my mind.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.934
This is such
controversial bullcrap!

02:48.936 --> 02:51.270
Adam has emmy mirsky
in his room right now!

02:51.272 --> 02:52.538
Oh, please.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.372
Emmy mirsky doesn't count.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.108
They've been inseparable
since they were in diapers.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.376
He calls her "muscles".

02:57.378 --> 02:58.877
They're like
brother and sister.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.547
Really?
'cause if you ask me,

03:01.549 --> 03:05.017
That friendship is hardly
as innocent as we think.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.788
Ha! Busted!

03:10.390 --> 03:11.924
Wait.
What are you doing?

03:11.926 --> 03:14.626
It rained so we got worms,
and now we're trying to see

03:14.628 --> 03:17.596
Who can keep them
on their face the longest

03:17.598 --> 03:19.364
Without freaking out.

03:20.767 --> 03:21.934
Well,
that's sweet, guys.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.736
We'll give you
some privacy.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.806
Ugh! Not fair!

03:27.808 --> 03:28.640
What the hell
was that about?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.409
Something insane.
I don't even
question it anymore.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.144
I've got to get these
things off my face!

03:32.146 --> 03:35.447
Yes! I win.
You know what that means.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.983
Ow! You punched me
in my allergy shot.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.752
Adult adam:  <i>Yep. This was</i>
<i>my friend emmy mirsky.</i>

03:40.754 --> 03:43.355
<i>She was a goofball</i>
<i>and my wingman.</i>

03:43.357 --> 03:45.224
<i>Or maybe I was hers.</i>

03:45.226 --> 03:46.725
<i>Top gun</i> five.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.426
Later, goose!

03:47.428 --> 03:50.996
Whoa. I'm not goose.
You're goose. I'm maverick.

03:50.998 --> 03:51.496
Uh, wrong.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.999
I'm maverick because
I look super-cool
in aviator glasses,

03:54.001 --> 03:57.436
Which you can't wear
because of your
hilarious lazy eye.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.038
My mom says I can
get prescription shades,

04:00.040 --> 04:01.974
So you can suck it!

04:03.076 --> 04:03.842
Aah!

04:03.844 --> 04:04.776
Adult adam:  <i>Bead curtains.</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:07.946
<i>That alone</i>
<i>should have been enough</i>
<i>to get me to turn around.</i>

04:08.014 --> 04:11.049
Hey.
Re-dim that mood lighting.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.317
What are you doing?

04:12.319 --> 04:14.119
Trying to make it
romantic in here,

04:14.121 --> 04:17.055
Like a french boudoir
or lee majors' hot tub.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.959
Why?
'cause lexy bloom can't
step one foot into my room

04:20.961 --> 04:23.128
Even though emmy
sleeps over in your room

04:23.130 --> 04:24.396
Whenever her parents
go out of town.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.298
That's 'cause emmy's
not really a girl.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.901
She's like a sibling
except I like her.

04:29.903 --> 04:30.435
Please.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.538
It's just a matter
of time before you two
are making out.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.773
Gross!

04:34.775 --> 04:35.707
We're just friends.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.310
Dude,
you're so clueless.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.046
Men and women
can't be friends.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.349
That's a fact.
It's in the encyclopedia.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.150
Look it up.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.184
Why can't we be friends?

04:46.186 --> 04:48.920
A little thing
called sexual tension.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.657
You and emmy will happen.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.424
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:52.426 --> 04:56.328
I have to finish
setting the mood
before lexy arrives.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.163
(whale lowing on tape)

04:58.165 --> 05:00.098
(sighs) whale sounds.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.435
Ladies can't resist
their haunting song.
Look it up.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.772
I think you need
a new encyclopedia.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.875
(applause on tv)
man:  <i>Stay tuned.</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

05:09.877 --> 05:12.544
Beverly: Well, that was
the most humiliating thing

05:12.546 --> 05:14.079
I've ever been
through in my life.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.647
I'm the one
who's humiliated.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.750
You weren't sneaky at all.
Everyone saw you, mom.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.619
Saw me doing what?
Loving my daughter?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.454
Being a mom?
Hey! Enough!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.756
You two can argue
anywhere you like,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.491
But  <i>that's incredible!</i>
<i>Is on,</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:28.894
And there's
a one-legged model.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.329
I don't know
how she's gonna
walk the runway.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.198
Murray, I don't want
to hear about your stupid
tv show right now.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.102
Stupid? Is it stupid
that a baby can water ski?

05:37.104 --> 05:41.239
Is it stupid that
someone taught rats
to play basketball?

05:41.241 --> 05:45.243
No, that's not stupid.
No, that's incredible!

05:45.245 --> 05:46.178
I'll tell you
what's stupid.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.181
I can't go anywhere
without my mother
trying to ruin my life.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.316
All I was doing
was shopping at
the same mall as you.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.318
All of a sudden,
that's a capital crime?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.286
Why are you
always following me?

05:54.288 --> 05:56.488
I mean, what, exactly,
do you think I'm up to?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.024
I don't know.
That's why I was
following you.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.292
So, you admit it!

06:00.294 --> 06:00.826
Enough!

06:00.828 --> 06:04.596
You two have to
work out your crap
because it's exhausting.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.630
Dad's right.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.499
I'm heading off to
college in two years.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.568
Do you really want
to leave it like this?

06:09.570 --> 06:10.535
Of course not.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.537
Then please just back off.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.872
I need space!

06:13.874 --> 06:16.174
I need trust.

06:17.910 --> 06:18.577
Fine.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.878
Adult adam:
<i>And she meant it.</i>

06:19.880 --> 06:21.646
<i>Until the next time</i>
<i>my sister left the house.</i>

06:21.648 --> 06:23.315
<i>She went directly</i>
<i>to the real diary,</i>

06:23.317 --> 06:29.888
<i>And what she read would</i>
<i>shake her to her very core.</i>

06:33.993 --> 06:35.994
(gasps)

06:36.329 --> 06:38.263
Crack rock!

06:38.265 --> 06:40.198
Crack rock!

06:40.333 --> 06:41.099
(sniffles)

06:41.101 --> 06:44.236
Erica's gonna take
crack rocks.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.270
Erica what?

06:45.272 --> 06:45.937
I read it in her diary.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.806
Not the decoy,
but the real one.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.008
Her friends
are participating
in crack rock,

06:50.010 --> 06:53.545
And now erica
is also going to
participate in crack rock.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.280
Can't you just
trust erica enough

06:55.282 --> 06:56.581
To know that she's
not gonna go out

06:56.583 --> 06:58.650
And eat crack
with her friends?
No!

06:58.652 --> 07:02.621
If my little baby
so much as touches
one piece of crack,

07:02.623 --> 07:04.289
Then I have failed
as a mother.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.591
You usually say that
for dramatic effect,

07:06.593 --> 07:08.960
But I agree
with you on this one.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.495
Hey.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.930
What's for dinner?

07:11.932 --> 07:12.798
Dinner. Yes.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.567
Funny you
should ask that.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.369
Um, come over here.

07:17.371 --> 07:20.205
Come sit next
to mama, baby.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.274
Are you crying?
No.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.778
I hope you're hungry
'cause, uh, we are
just gonna sit,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.079
Have a little chat.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.982
Oh, look.
Look what I have.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.984
Do you know
what this is?

07:32.986 --> 07:34.252
An egg.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.488
This is your brain.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.458
This is drugs.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.060
(sizzling)

07:44.297 --> 07:48.033
This is
your brain on drugs.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.334
Any questions?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.136
Yeah, quite a few.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.504
Uh, what the hell
is happening?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.940
Listen.
Your father and I
have good reason

07:54.942 --> 07:57.876
To believe that
something is going to...

07:58.377 --> 07:59.744
Murray.
What?

07:59.746 --> 08:01.346
That is a brain.
That's not food.

08:01.348 --> 08:05.383
And you...
I know everything 'cause
I read your real diary.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.986
Well, there's one thing
you don't know.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.488
I only wrote that
as a trap.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.057
You wrote fake stuff
in your real diary?

08:12.059 --> 08:13.258
Yes, because I knew
you would read it,

08:13.260 --> 08:17.629
And I wanted to prove
that you are incapable
of trusting me.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.030
Here's an idea.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.232
Don't write
your feelings down.

08:20.234 --> 08:24.569
Shove them down
into your body and forget
about them like I do.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.538
There's no downside.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.808
You're not really gonna
try the crack rock?

08:29.810 --> 08:30.509
Of course not!

08:30.511 --> 08:34.546
And the fact that
you thought I would
tells me everything.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.081
Wait, honey.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.282
Please don't be mad at me.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.919
I'm not mad,
just disappointed.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.626
Adult adam:  <i>It had been</i>
<i>a day since barry told me</i>

08:47.628 --> 08:49.594
<i>Men and women</i>
<i>can't be friends.</i>

08:49.596 --> 08:50.795
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I knew he was wrong,</i>

08:50.797 --> 08:55.000
<i>I still found myself</i>
<i>feeling kind of</i>
<i>weird around emmy.</i>

08:55.002 --> 08:57.202
(video game beeping)

08:59.872 --> 09:01.106
(sighs) dude,
you died already?

09:01.108 --> 09:03.108
What's the matter with you?
You play solo.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.809
I'm not in the
mood for contra.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.178
I'm gonna go
grab a tastykake.
You want one?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.581
Bring the whole box.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.218
Pops!

09:13.220 --> 09:16.221
Oh, thank god.
I need you, man.
Really bad.

09:16.223 --> 09:20.592
Ah, I know that
desperate cry for help.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.993
Lady trouble?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.496
No. Yes.
I don't know.

09:24.498 --> 09:25.864
So, then, yes.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.432
Okay.
Here's my question.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.466
Can men and
women be friends?

09:28.468 --> 09:30.368
Oh, boy.
I thought you were
gonna ask me

09:30.370 --> 09:33.171
How to unhook
a bra or something.

09:33.173 --> 09:33.738
I'm all messed up.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.074
Barry said
emmy and I have
sexual tension.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.077
I don't know what that is,
but I think I got it,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.912
And now things
are totally weird.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.013
You and muscles mirsky?

09:42.015 --> 09:45.517
You two are lifelong buds.
There's no way.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.419
You sure?
Of course.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.788
Men and women
can be friends.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.856
Take me.
I got plenty.

09:51.858 --> 09:55.293
Gloria and sheila and mabel.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.030
Wait.
Aren't all of those
your ex-girlfriends?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.432
Oh, yeah.

10:00.434 --> 10:05.003
Well, they
started out as friends,
but I guess... Wait.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.504
Rose boykin.
She's a friend.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.840
So, you never
once kissed her.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.941
Once.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.876
Maybe twice.

10:12.211 --> 10:13.178
Maybe a lot more.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.280
(sighs)
none of this
helps me at all.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.948
It's not my fault.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.550
Women love me!

10:18.552 --> 10:19.384
Here.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.153
Let me show you
how to do the bra thing.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.223
Just name one
female friend. One.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.059
Forget me.
I'm a lost cause.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.328
But you love
movies, right?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.597
Go watch
<i>when harry met sally...</i>

10:32.599 --> 10:37.602
It's all about
how men and women
can be friends.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.771
Adult adam:
<i>I took pops' advice,</i>
<i>and that night</i>

10:39.773 --> 10:43.775
<i>We rented a movie</i>
<i>about two besties like us.</i>

10:47.146 --> 10:48.647
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

10:48.649 --> 10:52.317
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>pops hadn't quite</i>
<i>remembered how it ended.</i>

10:52.319 --> 10:53.818
I have to go home now.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.853
This is your home.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.188
Then you have
to go home now.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.392
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>things were awkward</i>
<i>in our house that week,</i>

11:00.394 --> 11:01.593
<i>And not just</i>
<i>between me and emmy.</i>

11:01.595 --> 11:05.430
<i>After my mom had</i>
<i>accused erica of</i>
<i>participating in crack rock,</i>

11:05.432 --> 11:07.899
<i>Tension in our house was</i>
<i>as thick as the ketchup</i>

11:07.901 --> 11:10.502
<i>My mom was bathing</i>
<i>our meatloaf in.</i>

11:10.504 --> 11:13.238
(squeezes bottle rhythmically)

11:13.606 --> 11:15.173
(ketchup sputters)

11:15.175 --> 11:17.409
(clears throat)

11:17.643 --> 11:18.043
(sighs)

11:18.045 --> 11:20.945
All right, that's enough.
You've made your point.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.080
I screwed up.

11:22.082 --> 11:26.818
But I promise from
now on, I will respect
your privacy for real.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.219
No more listening
through the vent?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.755
No more.
No more reading my diary?

11:30.757 --> 11:31.656
Wouldn't dream of it.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.192
I'm going to
the movies tonight
with lainey.

11:34.194 --> 11:34.826
Can you trust me?

11:34.828 --> 11:40.899
I can trust you
if you can promise me
that you can be trustworthy.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.333
I promise.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.136
I'm worthy of your trust.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.373
I can't believe
my mom trusted me!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.075
(chanting)
toga! Toga!

11:50.077 --> 11:52.177
No, don't do that.
Oh.

11:52.179 --> 11:57.082
Adult adam:  <i>As erica</i>
<i>was finally gonna live it up,</i>
<i>I was breaking down.</i>

11:57.084 --> 11:58.783
Harry and sally
are lovers!

11:58.785 --> 12:01.252
I'm pretty sure
you're wrong about that.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.254
Emmy and I just watched it.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.489
And?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.924
They end up together,

12:05.926 --> 12:08.526
Sucking on each other's
faces like moray eels.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.761
You know,
come to think of it,

12:09.763 --> 12:13.198
I saw that movie with
my friend miriam, and...

12:13.200 --> 12:15.266
We just might have
left early to...

12:15.268 --> 12:18.770
Well, you don't need to
know why we left early.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.404
What do I do now?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.340
How do I get things
back to normal with emmy?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.042
You can't.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.910
The horse is
out of the barn.

12:25.912 --> 12:26.377
What horse?

12:26.379 --> 12:29.147
The horse that
goes by the name
of sexual tension.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.283
And there's only one way
to ease that tension.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.085
By remaining friends
and not addressing it?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.588
You got to kiss her,
see if there's sparks.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.457
Me and lexy bloom
are dealing with
the same issue.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.392
It's been tough.
I'm not gonna lie.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.660
What are you
talking about?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.062
She didn't even
show up yesterday.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.064
Yeah, 'cause she didn't
trust herself around me.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.767
Well, it's different
with me and emmy.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.601
Pops,
tell him he's nuts.

12:49.603 --> 12:54.939
Kiddo, you just got
to follow your heart.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.777
What does that mean?
Tell me.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.311
Do I kiss her or not?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.646
I don't know.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.781
You've asked
the one question

13:02.783 --> 13:05.784
That men and women
have debated since
the dawn of time.

13:05.786 --> 13:10.321
Nobody knows,
nobody on this planet.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.590
I know.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.459
It's kissing time, bro.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.227
(sighs)

13:18.264 --> 13:20.732
Bevy,
you promised the girl.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.600
Relax.
I'm just tidying up.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.870
Really? Wow.
That's a big step.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.808
I know. It feels good
to finally trust her.

13:29.810 --> 13:35.346
The fact that her sheet
is missing from her bed

13:35.348 --> 13:37.749
Doesn't bother me at all.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.517
Good.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.319
Wait.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.254
What does that have
to do with anything?

13:43.256 --> 13:43.855
Nothing.

13:43.857 --> 13:48.359
I may have overheard her
talking about a fraternity
toga party over at villanova,

13:48.361 --> 13:50.428
But I'm sure there's
hundreds of other reasons

13:50.430 --> 13:55.400
She would take a bedsheet
to the movies with lainey.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.067
Oh, I know.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.269
Maybe it was
one of those movies

13:58.271 --> 14:00.471
Where they ask you
to bring a sheet.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.272
Those exist, right?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.340
Oh, I see
what you're trying to do.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.076
You want me to
suggest that we go out
and track her down

14:05.078 --> 14:06.911
So you can
still look innocent.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.413
Well,
it's not going to work.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.281
Your baby girl is
at a college frat house

14:10.283 --> 14:13.151
Wearing a thin layer
of bedding.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.054
Holy (bleep)
let's go!

14:17.223 --> 14:21.526
Adult adam:  <i>As much</i>
<i>as I hated to admit it,</i>
<i>I knew barry was right.</i>

14:21.528 --> 14:22.594
<i>Emmy and I had to kiss.</i>

14:22.596 --> 14:26.798
<i>So I put on</i>
<i>my best suit and braced</i>
<i>myself for the worst.</i>

14:27.399 --> 14:29.801
Got your call.
What's the emergency?

14:29.803 --> 14:32.303
Why are you dressed
like a game show host?

14:32.305 --> 14:35.306
(sighs)
please have a seat.

14:35.308 --> 14:35.907
We need to chat.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.775
I came all the way
here to chat?

14:37.777 --> 14:40.845
Why do we even have
walkie-talkies?

14:43.649 --> 14:44.082
Okay.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.284
I know it's been
weird between us,

14:46.286 --> 14:48.219
But I know how to fix it.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.455
(exhales deeply)
we got to kiss.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.422
What?

14:51.424 --> 14:52.123
It's the only way.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.992
We have to find out
if there's sparks.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.293
There aren't any sparks.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.227
We don't know that!

14:56.229 --> 14:59.764
You saw what happened
to harry and sally.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.532
We got to do this.

15:05.170 --> 15:05.536
Fine.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.239
I'll give you a stupid kiss
for one second.
Three seconds.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.908
Eyes open.
Eyes closed.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.875
Lights on.
Dimmed.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.443
Don't touch
my hair or face.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.679
I'm not gonna
touch you. Gross.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.482
Thank you.
(sighs)

15:17.616 --> 15:19.417
Let's do this.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.353
Chiclet?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.126
All right.
On the count of three.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.395
One.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.364
Two.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.569
Nope! Can't do it!

15:38.571 --> 15:39.437
We have to, emmy.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.473
It's the only way to know
if we can still be friends.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.509
I already know!

15:45.577 --> 15:48.913
We're not
friends anymore.
You ruined it.

15:48.915 --> 15:53.151
Adult adam:  <i>I wasn't</i>
<i>the only one having the</i>
<i>worst night of their life.</i>

15:53.153 --> 15:54.118
<i>Erica's toga party,</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:57.622
<i>Not as awesome as</i>
<i>she thought it would be.</i>

15:58.057 --> 15:59.257
Yo.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.792
Me? Oh.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.292
Yo.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.593
What's going on
with your toga?

16:02.595 --> 16:05.697
Oh, I accidentally
took the fitted sheet.

16:05.699 --> 16:06.464
What's a fitted sheet?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.600
You know,
the sheet at the bottom
with the elastic around it?

16:09.602 --> 16:10.234
You have two sheets?

16:10.236 --> 16:11.769
What kind of fancy house
do you live in?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.205
Hey, kyle.
We need you for
the keg stands.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.942
And, no,
you're not invited,
dorky high school girl.

16:17.944 --> 16:18.609
I'm not in high school.

16:18.611 --> 16:22.347
Oh, really?
Name one professor
at villanova. Go.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.649
Professor togerman.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.685
Yeah. Why don't you
take your fitted sheet
and run on home?

16:27.687 --> 16:31.456
How does everyone know
about these special sheets?

16:33.058 --> 16:34.092
Lainey.

16:34.094 --> 16:34.625
Hey.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.829
Ox just invited
me to his room to
see his aquarium.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.503
(cans clattering)

16:45.505 --> 16:47.905
Girl: Way to go,
high school!

16:47.907 --> 16:51.909
Adult adam:  <i>As much as</i>
<i>erica hated that my mom</i>
<i>was always in her business,</i>

16:51.911 --> 16:53.811
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>she sort of wished</i>

16:53.813 --> 16:56.781
<i>Beverly was there</i>
<i>to save her.</i>

16:56.783 --> 16:59.283
<i>That feeling quickly faded.</i>

16:59.285 --> 17:01.486
Mom?
What the hell?

17:01.488 --> 17:02.587
No, you what the hell.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.655
Get in the car
right now!

17:04.657 --> 17:07.458
Murray, calm down.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.527
Just calm down.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.030
Erica, get in the car!

17:14.166 --> 17:17.368
So, this is what happens
when I trust you, huh?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.104
Guess who's
disappointed now.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.774
If you were gonna
guess me, you'd be right.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.309
And this is the reason
why I feel the need

17:25.311 --> 17:28.146
To keep such close
watch over everything.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.947
Are you crying?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.383
Murray, take a walk.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.951
But it's about to rain.

17:33.953 --> 17:36.120
Take a walk.

17:37.022 --> 17:38.790
You know
who's disappointed?

17:38.792 --> 17:41.526
Me. Disappointed!

17:44.129 --> 17:45.997
So, what happened?
It doesn't matter.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.966
All I know is
that you were right
not to trust me.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.101
But I do trust you.

17:50.103 --> 17:50.968
No, you don't.
I don't.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.472
You don't trust me
and I keep doing
untrustworthy things

17:54.474 --> 17:58.609
Which makes
you not trust me,
and I'm so tired of it.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.611
When is this gonna be
any different?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.979
Probably never.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.514
My mom used to do
the same thing to me,

18:03.516 --> 18:07.852
And I swore
I'd never do it to you,
but here I am doing it.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.520
But look
on the bright side.

18:09.522 --> 18:13.224
One day you'll have
a daughter of your own
not to trust.

Emmy,
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

19:05.278 --> 19:09.347
And the thing is,
I don't love you.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.149
You mean it?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.016
Look.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.117
Sometimes,
you meet a girl

19:13.119 --> 19:15.887

that she's the one.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.088

That helps you hide it

19:23.763 --> 19:25.329
When you put too much
confidence in a fart,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.765
She's the one that helps you
bury your underpants

19:27.767 --> 19:29.734

behind the school.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.535
