So, why do they

17:02.480 --> 17:04.524
call you Gorilla?

It's like, I can eat

17:04.565 --> 17:06.442
a banana with my feet.

At last, a real man.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.199
Paul, aren't you going

17:11.155 --> 17:13.199
to ask Rachel to dance?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.660
Well, why bother?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.660
She'd rather be with Steve.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.038
Well, Steve

17:17.286 --> 17:19.038
already has a date.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.793
Look, Rachel,

17:21.916 --> 17:23.793
I'm gonna go find D.J., okay?

17:23.835 --> 17:25.294
No, wait a minute.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.637
Do you still wanna go?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.640
Yes.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.809
Look, Rachel,

17:37.682 --> 17:39.809
when you broke up with me

17:39.851 --> 17:42.228
I'll admit, I used to

17:39.851 --> 17:42.228
hope that you'd come back to me

17:42.269 --> 17:43.771
and-and that

17:42.269 --> 17:43.771
you kiss me like that

17:43.813 --> 17:45.940
and everything

17:43.813 --> 17:45.940
would be like it was.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.066
Yeah, but it can be.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.109
No. No, it can't.

Because...now

And...she means

17:52.405 --> 17:54.741
everything to me.

If you can kiss

18:13.342 --> 18:15.469

18:15.511 --> 18:17.555
I did not kiss Rachel.

Yeah, right!

That's four lips

Wow! Okay, alright, fine!

I'll ask the questions

who the heck is Paul?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.645
Oh, Paul, that would

I saw you kissing Rachel?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.195
I know exactly how you felt.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.905
Like someone punched

21:19.237 --> 21:20.905
you in the stomach.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.698
And knocked all

21:20.947 --> 21:22.698
the wind out of you.

I felt the same way

21:22.740 --> 21:26.244
when I saw you kissed Paul.

Good. That was the idea.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.874
Look, D.J., I told you

21:29.622 --> 21:31.874
I didn't wanna kiss Rachel.

- But you did kiss her!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.376
- But I didn't feel anything!

It was like kissing my aunt.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.465
Okay, fine, it was a little

21:36.545 --> 21:39.465
better than kissing my aunt.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.135
But it wasn't anything

21:39.506 --> 21:42.135
like kissing you.

Come on, Steve.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.392
Oh, no. I thought she was

my first love, but I was wrong.
