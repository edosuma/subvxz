He's one of my best friends.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.633
And C, I don't cheat.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.100
Fine. But if you think you're gonna be
in my band now,

20:43.166 --> 20:44.500
[SCOFFS] you're so not.

20:45.066 --> 20:48.367
And you, Lizzie McGuire,
are never going to L-squared.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.233
Aw. I think I'll live.

Staying up late again tonight?

20:58.934 --> 21:00.934
No way. I'm exhausted.

21:01.767 --> 21:04.233
I asked Mom and Dad
to give me back my bedtime.

21:04.300 --> 21:07.500
Funny. In a way,
I just got my bedtime back, too.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.033
You are really dumb.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.000
No. But sometimes
it may seem that way.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.767
-Nah. You really are.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.667
Hey! I was there first!

21:15.734 --> 21:16.967
Too bad. I'm bigger.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.066
Too bad. I'm faster!

MALE CREW MEMBER 4: What is it?
MALE CREW MEMBER 5: I got it.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.467

You still gonna ride
your scooter? [CHUCKLES]
