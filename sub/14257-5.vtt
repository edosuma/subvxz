01:20.314 --> 01:22.449
Me, a lardo ?

01:22.844 --> 01:24.326
No way, dudes.

01:24.591 --> 01:26.056
Read it and weep, Michelangelo.

01:26.523 --> 01:28.253
How can he ? His
Stomach's in the way.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.422
Yeah, Rafael's right.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.234
One more pizza
with chocolate sprinkles

01:31.484 --> 01:33.369
and you'll have to let out your shell.

01:34.855 --> 01:37.573
Exactly, Donatello.
It's time you practiced

01:37.989 --> 01:39.695
some self-discipline, Michelangelo.

01:40.312 --> 01:41.672
Oh, bummer.

01:42.199 --> 01:43.090
Michelangelo,

01:43.406 --> 01:45.636
don't leave whil

01:45.636 --> 01:46.551
is giving you advice.

01:46.801 --> 01:49.441
Believe me, this isn't my idea.

01:49.860 --> 01:54.607
Whatever Michelangelo's
got is catching.

01:54.943 --> 01:56.488
Master, what's going on ?

01:56.711 --> 02:00.236
I have my suspicions,
but it is too soon to tell.

02:06.768 --> 02:08.548
Finally, we have the perfect weapon.

02:08.548 --> 02:10.597
A gravity altering device.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.712
With it, I can control gravity

02:12.712 --> 02:14.075
and force the city

02:14.075 --> 02:16.178
to obey my every command !

02:17.564 --> 02:18.907
Your command ?

02:18.907 --> 02:21.199
I'm the one who invented it.

02:21.529 --> 02:23.073
Krang, you're nothing

02:23.325 --> 02:25.118
but a throbbing, pulsating brain.

02:25.496 --> 02:27.487
Why not leave the messy details

02:27.720 --> 02:29.717
of conquering the world to me.

02:30.455 --> 02:31.579
I'm increasing its

02:32.452 --> 02:33.653
anti-gravitational potency

02:33.930 --> 02:34.974
to go beyond

02:35.272 --> 02:36.491
the subterranean level.

02:36.491 --> 02:39.469
No, stop ! It's not perfected yet.

02:39.735 --> 02:40.999
I can't wait any longer.

02:41.213 --> 02:44.060
I want this city to grovel at my
feet now !

02:44.386 --> 02:48.550
Shredder, you're
an insane, power-mad thing !

02:49.627 --> 02:50.777
Thank you.

02:52.510 --> 02:55.943
April, I think I finally met mr. Right.

02:56.207 --> 02:57.846
That's wonderful, Irma.

02:58.174 --> 03:00.589
This time it's the real thing, April.

03:00.922 --> 03:04.085
Oh, he really sweeps me off my feet.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.333
So I see.

03:07.344 --> 03:09.544
Irma, what's happening to us ?

03:09.871 --> 03:11.462
You, too ?

03:11.760 --> 03:14.713
So, you have that effect
on all women.

03:14.941 --> 03:17.333
And I thought you were faithful to me.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.512
What's going on ?

03:22.712 --> 03:24.473
April, this is all your fault !

03:24.708 --> 03:26.519
When you asked
that tightwad Thompson

03:26.519 --> 03:28.675
for a raise, everything hit the ceiling.

03:29.265 --> 03:30.981
What's that, Vernon ?

03:31.558 --> 03:33.572
Oh ! Uh, hi there, mr. Thompson.

03:33.572 --> 03:36.412
Nice of you to drop in. I mean up.

03:36.803 --> 03:40.623
I'll bet those outlaw turtles
are behind this.

03:40.951 --> 03:43.152
I don't think so, mr. Thompson.

03:43.697 --> 03:46.224
Don't defend them !
It's just the sort of trick

03:46.224 --> 03:49.357
those sewer-swimming
juveniles would pull !

03:49.626 --> 03:51.308
April, do you think

03:51.308 --> 03:53.381
maybe those turtles did cause this ?

03:53.599 --> 03:54.897
No way, Irma,

03:55.176 --> 03:57.311
But maybe they can save us from it.

03:58.653 --> 03:59.405
Come in, turtles.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.511
This is April.
I need help.

04:02.383 --> 04:06.376
Something truly freakazoid's
happening.

04:06.656 --> 04:08.360
All this bouncing oOn the ceiling

04:08.360 --> 04:10.058
has my ears beeping.

04:10.353 --> 04:14.850
April, this is Leonardo.
What's up ?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.206
We are.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.250
Something's gone
crazy with gravity.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.493
Tell me about it. We're
having the same problem.

04:21.772 --> 04:23.350
What do you think is causing it ?

04:23.584 --> 04:24.876
My guess is

04:24.876 --> 04:28.105
it has something to do
with Shredder and Krang.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.494
Krang, you're such a worry wart.

04:32.116 --> 04:33.505
The gravity-altering device

04:33.709 --> 04:35.080
is working perfectly.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.266
Now to increase the power.

04:37.747 --> 04:40.774
No ! No ! You'll cause an overload.

04:41.119 --> 04:42.976
Nonsense. I know what i'm doing.

04:51.493 --> 04:52.149
Great.

04:52.366 --> 04:53.722
The biggest story of my career,

04:53.722 --> 04:56.018
And I can't get down to cover it.

04:56.224 --> 04:57.687
Well, you said you wanted

04:57.687 --> 04:59.533
to make it to the top of the company.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.303
This must be a dream.

05:01.527 --> 05:03.986
Somebody splash some
water on my face.

05:06.549 --> 05:08.923
It's not a dream.
It's a nightmare.

05:09.182 --> 05:11.263
Somebody pinch me, please.

05:13.677 --> 05:16.077
Irma, are you all right ?

05:16.345 --> 05:19.337
Sure. I'm used to being dropped.

05:21.662 --> 05:23.584
Donatello, is that you ?

05:23.972 --> 05:25.359
What's going on ?

05:26.172 --> 05:27.421
I wish i knew, April.

05:27.796 --> 05:29.978
First we're floating,
then we're crashing.

05:30.772 --> 05:33.601
A mondo nutzoid experience, dudes.

05:34.147 --> 05:37.482
Yeah. If you can't
trust mother gravity,

05:37.730 --> 05:39.154
who can you trust ?

05:39.465 --> 05:41.629
Now i'm certain that
Shredder is behind this.

05:41.864 --> 05:43.377
We must stop him.

05:46.467 --> 05:51.623
You fool ! I warned you
the device wasn't perfected !

05:52.568 --> 05:55.331
Oh. I haven't time for
such niggling details.

05:55.578 --> 05:56.886
What are you doing ?!

05:57.167 --> 05:59.882
You're not licensed
to make those adjustments.

06:00.138 --> 06:02.649
I'm making emergency repairs.

06:03.115 --> 06:04.425
A few simple adjustments,

06:04.625 --> 06:06.798
And I can cause some real damage.

06:14.924 --> 06:16.670
Picking up any signals, Donatello ?

06:16.933 --> 06:19.279
Gravity scope registers a total zip.

06:19.603 --> 06:20.880
Let's pack it in, guys.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.257
We've been searching for two hours

06:22.257 --> 06:23.597
and haven't found diddly.

06:24.064 --> 06:26.327
It is possible that
Anti-gravity glitch

06:26.327 --> 06:28.249
Was just a freak
Of nature.

06:28.461 --> 06:29.678
Talk about freaking.

06:29.678 --> 06:32.237
Scope out the street
Just ahead.

06:32.488 --> 06:34.969
Something's radiating
From beneath the street.

06:35.218 --> 06:36.922
Leonardo,
Hit the brakes.

06:37.324 --> 06:38.876
I'm trying, but

06:38.876 --> 06:41.085
Something's pulling
Us toward it.

06:46.232 --> 06:48.649
Ing
On our heads.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.135
What's going on ?

06:50.820 --> 06:52.819
It's some kind
Of hyper-gravity.

06:52.819 --> 06:55.512
And it's not just
Affecting us. Look.

07:01.428 --> 07:02.080
Whatever it is

07:02.298 --> 07:04.809
Has the whole city
In its clutches.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.495
Oh, beautiful, isn't it ?
The perfect way

07:08.741 --> 07:10.744
To bend a city
To my will.

07:10.989 --> 07:15.159
Fool ! What good is a city
That can't move ?

07:15.575 --> 07:16.969
Don't you see, krang ?

07:16.969 --> 07:21.143
Citizens who can't move
Can't fight back.

07:21.768 --> 07:23.410
Rock steady, bebop,
Are you ready ?

07:23.875 --> 07:27.249
Yeah. Ready
To make turtle stew

07:27.449 --> 07:29.224
Out of those shell backs.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.879
we'll mash 'em
Into mush.

07:33.080 --> 07:33.857
Just remember,

07:34.091 --> 07:35.903
You're wearing
Antigravity boots.

07:36.262 --> 07:37.838
As long as you keep
Those boots on,

07:38.070 --> 07:39.317
You can move
Anywhere.

07:39.553 --> 07:40.504
Now get to work !

07:40.736 --> 07:44.217
Work ? This is going
To be pure pleasure.

07:55.963 --> 07:57.662
Please unlock my feet.

07:57.886 --> 08:00.455
I've got to go home and
Cook dinner for my husband !

08:01.051 --> 08:02.689
The nerve !
Keeping us here

08:02.904 --> 08:05.167
Until we buy
Your tacky dresses.

08:05.728 --> 08:07.651
Honest, ladies,
I'm not doing it.

08:07.651 --> 08:09.195
I can't move,
Either.

08:16.039 --> 08:19.658
Hey, look ! A ladie''
Dress shop.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.655
Gee, i never been
In one before.

08:26.759 --> 08:28.785
All right,
Quit gawking.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.248
We ain't got time
For a fashion show.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.231
We gotta find
Them turtles.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.010
Come on !

08:38.256 --> 08:40.299
You win. I'll buy
The dress.

08:40.548 --> 08:42.751
I'll buy all
Of your dresses !

08:43.139 --> 08:45.899
Lady, i had nothing
To do with it.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.050
Mondo bizarro,
Dudes.

08:51.389 --> 08:52.840
Well, it could be worse.

08:53.174 --> 08:54.435
Yeah ? How ?

08:54.794 --> 08:56.852
Uh, that's how.

08:57.536 --> 09:01.523
It's those freakazoids
Bebop and rock steady.

09:01.753 --> 09:04.252
Looks like they have
No trouble walking.

09:04.844 --> 09:07.088
Turtle alert !
We're under attack !

09:07.574 --> 09:10.253
It's turtle trashin' time !

09:19.246 --> 09:20.841
Ok, troops, fall in

09:20.841 --> 09:23.258
For some lootin'
And shootin'.

09:26.882 --> 09:30.244
i'm gonna crack
Some shells

09:31.088 --> 09:32.199
How come
Those sleazoids

09:32.199 --> 09:34.131
Can walk around,
And we can't ?

09:34.487 --> 09:35.380
It probably
Has to do with

09:35.380 --> 09:36.991
Those klutzy boots
They're wearing.

09:38.438 --> 09:41.553
Oh, man, i'd sure like to
Get my hands on their feet.

09:41.945 --> 09:44.477
Michelangelo,
You just gave me an idea.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.517
When rock steady gets here,
Keep him distracted.

09:48.729 --> 09:51.028
Yummy !
My favorite dish.

09:51.243 --> 09:52.867
Turtles in a stew.

09:53.197 --> 09:54.470
Hey, rhino breath !

09:54.679 --> 09:55.940
I bet
You're too chicken

09:56.146 --> 09:57.234
To step inside.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.634
Oh, yeah ?
Just watch.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.025
Hey, dude,
Why don't you

10:03.237 --> 10:05.798
Take that bony nose
Of yours and blow.

10:06.537 --> 10:07.503
Oh, yeah ?

10:07.503 --> 10:10.491
I'm going to walk
All over your face.

10:11.276 --> 10:14.830
It worked !
Grab him !

10:15.966 --> 10:17.110
He's grabbed.

10:17.110 --> 10:18.964
Donatello, help me
Get his boots.

10:22.477 --> 10:24.890
Whew ! This is
Hazardous work.

10:25.301 --> 10:26.392
Hey, you wimps !

10:26.644 --> 10:29.476
Give me back my boots.

10:29.733 --> 10:32.287
Can't somebody
Make him pipe down ?

10:36.873 --> 10:38.369
Quick thinking,
Donatello.

10:38.683 --> 10:40.678
Michelangelo,
Hold still.

10:41.061 --> 10:43.364
This is
A 3-point shot.

10:48.134 --> 10:51.635
<i>All right ! These boots
were made for walking.</i>

10:51.960 --> 10:53.206
Then walk out there
And capture more

10:53.422 --> 10:55.810
Antigravity boots
For the rest of us.

11:02.049 --> 11:03.378
Too bad they
Don't come in green.

11:07.650 --> 11:08.482
Oh, no !

11:08.773 --> 11:10.789
Foot soldiers
After my footgear.

11:11.507 --> 11:12.627
And the hyper-gravity's

11:12.876 --> 11:15.283
Put my chuks
In slo-mo mode.

11:20.820 --> 11:21.549
Bummer.

11:21.784 --> 11:24.005
Their ray blasters
Are in fast mode.

11:24.889 --> 11:26.526
But i got
A rad idea.

11:26.935 --> 11:28.555
Oh, i sure hope
This works.

11:40.139 --> 11:41.937
Score--turtles 2.

11:41.937 --> 11:44.306
Bad guys...zippo.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.329
Hey, guys.
Watch the birdies.

11:49.236 --> 11:50.294
No, don't you get it ?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.072
The birds--
They're flying.

11:52.356 --> 11:54.215
Everything else
Is stuck to the ground,

11:54.415 --> 11:56.787
But the birds are above
The pull of gravity.

11:57.065 --> 11:58.631
If we can get
To the turtle blimp,

11:58.831 --> 12:00.169
We can fly, too.

12:00.419 --> 12:03.025
Yeah, but we got to walk
Out of here first.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.071
Hey, it's
A done deed, dudes. Ha ha.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.238
Got your antigravity boots.

12:08.784 --> 12:10.951
Four boots
For six feet ?

12:11.292 --> 12:13.343
No problem, guys.
I've got the solution.

12:14.415 --> 12:15.973
Well, guys,
What do you think ?

12:16.190 --> 12:17.849
I think all that time
Upside-down

12:18.067 --> 12:19.080
Affected your brain.

12:19.408 --> 12:20.466
Hey, it's either this

12:20.466 --> 12:22.637
Or someone rides you
Turtle-back.

12:28.984 --> 12:30.699
With total mastery
Of gravity,

12:30.985 --> 12:33.945
I control what rises
And what falls.

12:34.355 --> 12:38.420
Shredder, i see that power
Makes you light-headed.

12:38.787 --> 12:41.575
I tell you, krang,
The world is mine !

12:42.374 --> 12:43.429
Ours.

12:43.677 --> 12:47.984
Signaling for help ?!

12:48.491 --> 12:51.184
Bebop, rock steady,
Where are the turtles ?

12:51.593 --> 12:53.444
They clobbered
Your foot soldiers

12:53.444 --> 12:54.958
And stole their boots.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.374
You pathetic peons !

12:57.671 --> 12:59.859
Can't i trust you to
Do anything right ?

13:00.372 --> 13:01.872
Where are you going ?

13:02.168 --> 13:03.105
To the surface

13:03.334 --> 13:05.524
To take personal charge
Of things.

13:12.930 --> 13:14.209
Donatello,
You were right.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.751
The hyper-gravity force

13:15.988 --> 13:18.918
Only extends about a dozen
Feet above the earth.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.135
Now all we have
To do is locate

13:21.337 --> 13:22.474
The source of it.

13:32.117 --> 13:33.426
Do those
Insufferable turtles

13:33.663 --> 13:35.937
Really think they can
Get the best of me ?

13:36.829 --> 13:39.138
A minor adjustment
To these anchor boots

13:39.998 --> 13:43.737
And a major adjustment to
The gravity-altering device,

13:44.033 --> 13:45.702
And we'll see
How the turtles deal

13:45.985 --> 13:48.953
With ultra
Reverse gravity.

13:50.027 --> 13:53.113
What is that maniac
Shredder doing ?

13:54.595 --> 13:56.248
Leonardo, look out
For that cat !

13:58.717 --> 14:00.853
What's a cat
Doing up here ?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.724
Probably asking
That same question

14:02.925 --> 14:04.335
About four turtles.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.656
It's getting
Mondo crowded up here.

14:07.951 --> 14:09.635
Look !
The objects floating up

14:09.870 --> 14:11.508
Are getting bigger
And bigger.

14:11.963 --> 14:15.592
No wonder. The gravity force
Is now in full reverse.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.214
Hang on ! I have
To use full power

14:19.448 --> 14:21.135
To keep us
From drifting away.

14:22.566 --> 14:25.032
Look ! Even buildings
Are breaking loose.

14:25.671 --> 14:27.542
Mega disaster, dudes !

14:30.184 --> 14:32.087
If i can't
Dominate this city,

14:32.317 --> 14:33.379
I'll destroy it

14:33.585 --> 14:36.248
By letting it float
Completely off the planet.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.699
The entire city
Is floating away.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.681
Cowabunga !
A pizza truck.

14:52.366 --> 14:54.700
You know, the world's
Really gone bizarro

14:54.916 --> 14:56.499
When pizzas
Bite you back.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.745
Look out !
Flying food.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.766
Look what's headed
This way now.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.079
It's rock steady
And bebop.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.991
Hang on ! We're
Going to collide !

15:10.612 --> 15:12.067
That smarts.

15:12.343 --> 15:14.088
Enjoy it, pig face.

15:14.369 --> 15:17.212
That's the only kind of
Smarts you'll ever have.

15:17.462 --> 15:19.178
It's the turtles !

15:20.179 --> 15:23.283
You wimps are about
To get mashed.

15:26.881 --> 15:28.085
Come back.

15:28.317 --> 15:30.176
Where are you guys
Going ?

15:30.709 --> 15:33.123
You suppose it was
Something we said ?

15:34.609 --> 15:36.730
If this reverse gravity
Gets any worse,

15:37.007 --> 15:39.807
The whole city will be
A vacant lot.

15:40.486 --> 15:41.796
Leonardo, help !

15:42.091 --> 15:44.293
The channel 6 building
Is pulling away

15:44.526 --> 15:45.780
From its foundation !

15:46.041 --> 15:47.341
We're trapped
On the roof.

15:47.661 --> 15:49.957
Help is on its way,
Ladies. Hang on.

15:50.406 --> 15:53.062
Believe me,
I have every intention.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.313
The turtles are coming
As fast as they can.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.694
Oh, great.

15:57.028 --> 15:59.548
My life depends on
The speed of a turtle.

16:00.343 --> 16:01.502
What's that ?

16:05.092 --> 16:07.162
We're lifting
Into the sky !

16:07.867 --> 16:08.644
Quick, leonardo.

16:08.911 --> 16:10.608
We've got to anchor down
The building.

16:10.954 --> 16:12.781
Prepare to launch
Grappling hook.

16:13.157 --> 16:14.400
Fire !

16:15.232 --> 16:16.853
Good shot,
Leonardo.

16:17.285 --> 16:18.736
Piece of cake.

16:19.001 --> 16:20.936
Now let's find another
Building to anchor to,

16:21.201 --> 16:23.482
Something...humongous.

16:23.859 --> 16:25.259
How's that one ?

16:25.515 --> 16:26.447
They don't get

16:26.447 --> 16:29.273
Much more humongous
Than that.

16:31.763 --> 16:34.275
Great. Now for
The finishing touches.

16:35.589 --> 16:37.770
Hold her steady,
Leonardo.

16:41.248 --> 16:43.497
Primo to the extremo.

16:44.151 --> 16:45.476
You were right, april.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.398
The turtles did save us.

16:48.148 --> 16:49.690
You ladies ok ?

16:50.688 --> 16:53.324
Ahh, we're fine
Thanks to you.

16:54.389 --> 16:57.755
I could kiss you fellas
If you had lips.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.110
What's causing
All this craziness ?

17:00.422 --> 17:01.985
I think i've come up
With a theory.

17:02.323 --> 17:03.499
Look over there.

17:04.058 --> 17:06.614
Those energy rays pulsating
Up from the ground.

17:06.973 --> 17:08.489
You think
Th

17:08.489 --> 17:10.063
Is coming from there ?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.503
As michelangelo
Would say,

17:11.730 --> 17:13.184
Exactamundo,
Dude.

17:13.523 --> 17:17.845
Exacta--so like what
Do we do about it ?

17:18.190 --> 17:20.109
See that stupendous dish ?

17:20.441 --> 17:22.392
Why, thank you,
Donatello.

17:22.979 --> 17:24.462
Not you, irma.

17:24.838 --> 17:26.800
I was talking about
That satellite dish.

17:27.306 --> 17:30.890
Oh. It's just like a man
To choose tv over me.

17:31.730 --> 17:33.991
Donatello, next time
You get a brainstorm,

17:34.194 --> 17:35.259
Make it a small one.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.895
Good luck, guys.

17:37.095 --> 17:38.999
Come back with
My satellite dish,

17:38.999 --> 17:41.466
You sewer-dwelling
Swamp rats !

17:41.890 --> 17:44.912
Chill out, dude.
We're just borrowing it.

17:45.192 --> 17:46.503
Yeah, do you mind ?
We're only trying

17:46.740 --> 17:48.521
To save the earth
From total disaster.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.074
The closer we get
To the center

17:51.296 --> 17:52.415
Of the reverse
Gravity force,

17:52.654 --> 17:55.130
The harder it is for
The turtle blimp to fly.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.597
I'm not sure our motors
Can handle this.

17:57.907 --> 17:59.627
We'll have to go in
With just the glider.

18:01.766 --> 18:02.810
We're moving closer.

18:03.164 --> 18:05.241
The reverse gravity force
Is taking over.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.583
Raphael, michelangelo.
Aim the satellite dish

18:08.814 --> 18:10.090
At the reverse-gravity
Field.

18:10.468 --> 18:12.361
Like what's
The plan, man ?

18:12.635 --> 18:14.759
There's no time
To explain. Just do it !

18:18.408 --> 18:19.780
That's it.
Pour it on.

18:36.610 --> 18:37.659
It worked !

18:38.003 --> 18:39.453
Boy, it sure did.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.482
How'd we do it ?

18:41.796 --> 18:44.176
Simple. We reversed
The reverse gravity.

18:44.831 --> 18:46.614
I knew i should
Have never

18:46.845 --> 18:48.406
Let shredder
Handle this.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.776
Now i'll do it
My way.

18:55.955 --> 18:57.938
Hey. What's happening ?

18:58.311 --> 18:59.233
Someone's cranked

18:59.466 --> 19:01.182
The power up
Full blast.

19:01.698 --> 19:03.897
The only thing better
Than maximum power

19:04.147 --> 19:07.078
Is super maximum power.

19:09.186 --> 19:10.141
Hey, donatello,

19:10.390 --> 19:12.756
What happens when
Too much reverse gravity

19:12.975 --> 19:14.831
Hits too much
Reverse gravity ?

19:15.098 --> 19:17.050
You know, that's
A good question, raphael...

19:20.464 --> 19:22.663
And i think it's
About to get answered.

19:29.901 --> 19:31.838
Here, raphael.
Grab on.

19:33.929 --> 19:34.883
Oh, thanks.

19:35.204 --> 19:36.442
Hey, how come
I fell down

19:36.690 --> 19:37.826
Instead of up ?

19:38.329 --> 19:40.792
Looks like gravity
Is back to normal.

19:47.029 --> 19:50.961
April's boss is
Gonna be mondo ticked off.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.019
Know where can we get
About 8 tons

19:53.273 --> 19:54.380
Of epoxy glue ?

19:54.766 --> 19:56.127
Hey, what's going on ?

19:56.359 --> 19:58.831
First we floating
And then we're falling.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.459
Yeah. I wish gravity

20:01.714 --> 20:04.223
Would make up
Its stupid mind.

20:05.141 --> 20:06.521
Looks like shredder's
About to get

20:06.780 --> 20:08.775
A couple of bundles
From heaven.

20:08.984 --> 20:11.431
Now where are rock steady
And bebop ? D'oh !

20:12.552 --> 20:13.695
Hi, boss.

20:14.382 --> 20:16.560
Oh, you nuclear-age
Numskulls !

20:16.819 --> 20:17.940
Where have you been ?

20:18.327 --> 20:19.623
Oh, here and there.

20:19.917 --> 20:20.889
Blast it !

20:21.116 --> 20:22.614
Those turtles
Foiled us again.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.015
You wretched reptiles !
You'll pay for this.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.619
Yeah, and bring cash.

20:29.055 --> 20:31.385
We don't take plastic.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.528
Shredder and
His goons are getting away !

20:38.089 --> 20:39.497
Freeze, sleaze.

20:40.147 --> 20:43.473
<i>sayonara, you
Shell-backed simpletons.</i>

20:43.844 --> 20:45.641
Come back here,
Shred head.

20:45.923 --> 20:47.810
Let's tangle.

20:50.397 --> 20:51.507
You should be happy,
Fellas.

20:51.801 --> 20:52.665
Shredder escaped,

20:52.879 --> 20:54.393
But at least
We saved the city.

20:54.812 --> 20:56.925
Oh, yeah, we're dancing
in the streets.

21:00.428 --> 21:02.662
Donatello, how is the repair work

21:02.662 --> 21:05.206
on the satellite dish progressing ?

21:05.456 --> 21:07.888
All finished, master,
and it's as good as new.

21:08.418 --> 21:09.976
Donatello, you're wonderful.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.518
The dish is repaired
and the city is saved.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.314
We had something

21:15.314 --> 21:17.125
to do with it, too, you know.

21:18.061 --> 21:19.165
Gangway, dudes.

21:19.466 --> 21:21.069
Hot pizzas coming through.

21:21.464 --> 21:23.487
Are those for the victory celebration ?

21:23.858 --> 21:25.110
Heck, no.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.673
They're for me.

21:27.356 --> 21:29.974
Michelangelo, what about your diet ?

21:30.304 --> 21:32.521
Master, I spent the entire day

21:32.741 --> 21:35.537
being lighter than air.
It was a total bummer.

21:37.682 --> 21:38.792
I'm just gonna make sure

21:39.071 --> 21:41.877
I never float away again.
