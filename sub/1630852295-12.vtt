Mornin'.

00:36.016 --> 00:39.013
We know something.

00:39.015 --> 00:44.011
Today's lesson is really gonna
<i>sweep</i> <i>you off your feet.</i>

00:44.013 --> 00:47.007
Uh, okay.
See ya.

00:47.009 --> 00:51.001
We hang out all the time, andI still don't get their humor.

00:51.003 --> 00:54.000
Those busy bodies didn't spoil
the surprise, did they?

00:54.002 --> 00:55.023
'Cause I will have
a cow right here

00:56.001 --> 00:57.010
and now if they did.

00:57.012 --> 00:59.010
I don't think so.
Ok, phew.

00:59.012 --> 01:00.013
You're getting
your broom today.

01:00.015 --> 01:02.015
My wand?!

01:02.017 --> 01:05.008
Listen with your ears,
not your heart, knucklehead.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.007
You've got a wand-track mind,
you know that?

01:07.009 --> 01:09.020
Uhh, wait.
You've had my broom

01:09.022 --> 01:11.013
in your fridge
this whole time?

01:11.015 --> 01:13.005
No, dummy.
I've had your broom order

01:13.007 --> 01:14.021
in my fridge
the whole time.

01:16.011 --> 01:18.020
Yes, I can use my fridge
as a closet.

01:18.022 --> 01:20.020
Basic holding spell.

01:20.022 --> 01:22.006
Map.
Order form.

01:22.008 --> 01:25.016
I hate filling out paperwork,
so do not lose them.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.019
Nice.

01:26.021 --> 01:29.002
Actually, this will be
super un-nice.

01:29.004 --> 01:31.004
The broom maker is
very unpleasant to be around.

01:31.006 --> 01:33.006
You'll need to be
on your best behavior

01:33.008 --> 01:35.004
if you want to leave
his workshop broom-in-hand.

01:35.006 --> 01:36.023
I'm a very inoffensive
presence.

01:37.001 --> 01:38.019
That may be, but you need to
bring a trusted someone

01:38.021 --> 01:42.009
as a spotter, and Oscar
is <i>not</i> <i>an inoffensive presence.</i>

01:42.011 --> 01:44.008
I know you're
just being you, Susie,

01:44.010 --> 01:46.019
but I am very excited
about this,

01:46.021 --> 01:48.018
and I'm happy
we know each other.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.021
Ew. Go.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.010
I'm a little nervous.

01:53.012 --> 01:56.004
It sounds like the broom maker
is a real prickly-pear.

01:56.006 --> 01:59.005
I've got your back Hedgehog.
I'm your trusted spotter.

01:59.007 --> 02:01.012
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

02:01.014 --> 02:02.020
This must be the place.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.012
This is a little self-indulgent.

02:04.014 --> 02:06.007
He must live alone.

02:06.009 --> 02:08.021
As a matter of fact,
I do.

02:13.013 --> 02:16.012
Oh, dear.
Sorry about your friend.

02:16.014 --> 02:19.021
No. No. He's fine. He pretends
to faint when he's scared.

02:19.023 --> 02:22.013
You can tell because
he keeps one eye slightly open.

02:22.015 --> 02:25.005
He's really committing.

02:25.007 --> 02:27.005
Give him a minute.
Anyway.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.009
H-Hello, sir.

02:28.011 --> 02:31.011
I'm H-H-Hedgehog.
I'm here for --

02:31.013 --> 02:33.008
Your broom, yes.

02:33.010 --> 02:35.021
Hello, Hedgehog.
Hello, Oscar.

02:35.023 --> 02:38.020
You've no need
for nervousness.

02:38.022 --> 02:42.006
Oh, Susie said you're...
unpleasant to be around.

02:42.008 --> 02:46.006
Susie just finds it unpleasant
to be around gentleness.

02:46.008 --> 02:49.008
Come. Let's get you fitted,
unless you know

02:49.010 --> 02:51.007
what type of broom
your mother used.

02:51.009 --> 02:53.002
Uh, my mom's
a professor.

02:53.004 --> 02:54.022
She basically
never uses a broom.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.005
Well I only ask because
a witch's magical traits

02:58.007 --> 03:00.011
are passed down
through the matriarch.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.012
It could have saved us
some time, but to be honest,

03:03.014 --> 03:07.014
I live for the fitting process.

03:07.016 --> 03:12.008
Flying is all about balance --
cosmic balance.

03:12.010 --> 03:14.004
So, when I make
someone a broom,

03:14.006 --> 03:17.006
I use a wood
that compliments who they are.

03:17.008 --> 03:19.000
If you'd step
onto the platform,

03:19.002 --> 03:21.014
I can take
your precise measurements.

03:21.016 --> 03:24.002
Foot in the stirrup there,
finger in here,

03:24.004 --> 03:26.006
and I'm just gonna
lightly lick this stick

03:26.008 --> 03:29.016
and put it in your ear.

03:30.021 --> 03:32.007
And where
would you like me?

03:32.009 --> 03:34.020
Don't need you just yet,
eager child.

03:34.022 --> 03:37.019
You can take a seat in the
waiting room right over there.

03:37.021 --> 03:38.023
Okay.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.001
I just need
your midday temperament,

03:41.003 --> 03:42.010
you midnight
temperament,

03:42.012 --> 03:44.023
the distance between
each tragus,

03:45.001 --> 03:47.008
and if you'd bit down
on this for me please...

03:47.010 --> 03:51.009
Hey, what's a four-letter word
for the time it's been

03:51.011 --> 03:52.021
since you've cast
a spell?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.023
Gape.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.014
Nope that's wrong.

03:55.016 --> 03:59.002
Mm, that just means you have
a letter wrong somewhere else.

03:59.004 --> 04:01.022
You know what? I'm just gonna do
"spot the difference."

04:02.000 --> 04:05.009
Your measurements reveal you're
particularly hard-shelled.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.011
Is that bad?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.000
I keep thinking
the hands have

04:08.002 --> 04:11.008
different numbers of fingers,
but they don't.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.011
It isn't bad or good.

04:13.013 --> 04:15.004
It's your truth.

04:15.006 --> 04:18.000
Come with me.

04:18.002 --> 04:21.023
The next step is to collect the
wood for your broom, Hedgehog.

04:22.001 --> 04:25.007
A hard-shelled girl needs
the softest wood --

04:25.009 --> 04:27.016
cedar, fir, and pine.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.003
I'm going to step into your
family tree forest for a moment.

04:34.005 --> 04:37.013
It's a most sacred place.

04:48.006 --> 04:51.009
Do you prefer cleaning your
belly button with cotton swabs

04:51.011 --> 04:53.020
or just going right in
with a finger?

04:53.022 --> 04:57.010
You're right, Hedgehog.

04:57.012 --> 04:59.019
Your mother
wasn't a witch.

04:59.021 --> 05:01.011
Your family tree
hasn't been touched

05:01.013 --> 05:03.005
in a couple
of generations.

05:03.007 --> 05:05.020
Does that mean my great grandma
might have been a witch?

05:05.022 --> 05:07.013
Hedgehog,
I don't know.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.008
I've got to
get this broom made

05:09.010 --> 05:11.009
while the wood is
still fresh.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.004
Let's meet at the test block
in half an hour.

05:18.007 --> 05:21.014
I had this test block outfitted
to replicate

05:21.016 --> 05:24.004
a real-world
flying experience.

05:24.006 --> 05:27.003
I'm not one to brag,
but my brooming strip

05:27.005 --> 05:28.019
is state of the art.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.020
Mm, I don't know
if that's still --

05:30.022 --> 05:34.004
Well, Hedgehog,
ready to fly?

05:34.006 --> 05:36.017
Yes, sir.
You may not be a wand, but --

05:36.019 --> 05:38.004
What was that,
Hedgehog?

05:38.006 --> 05:39.015
Uh, I love it.

05:39.017 --> 05:41.010
Well, give it a go.

05:45.009 --> 05:47.022
What's this?
What're you doing?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.020
Uh, I don't know.
My body's just doing this.

05:50.022 --> 05:54.012
Hmm.
Well, baby-broom steps.

05:54.014 --> 05:57.005
Do a small one.
See how it feels.

05:57.007 --> 06:02.006
Uh, uh, oh!
Aah!

06:04.004 --> 06:09.001
Ohh, okay.
Let's have a look at you.

06:09.003 --> 06:13.010
Hoo. You have a fearver
of 101 Dull Mooshions.

06:13.012 --> 06:16.015
Not a fearver!

06:16.017 --> 06:18.015
Neither of us know
what that means.

06:18.017 --> 06:21.008
Well, it means you have
this fear inside of you

06:21.010 --> 06:23.003
that you inherited
from your mom.

06:23.005 --> 06:25.007
But it's not
her fear, either.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.013
She got it
from her mom,

06:26.015 --> 06:28.023
and her mom from her mom,
and so on.

06:29.001 --> 06:32.013
This lineage of moms is often
referred to as a "moom".

06:32.015 --> 06:35.008
There's an old story
about it.

06:35.010 --> 06:37.022
The chicken leg story.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.011
There was a girl
about your age

06:39.013 --> 06:42.004
who wondered why her mother
always tied the chicken legs

06:42.006 --> 06:44.007
together when
she made a chicken.

06:44.009 --> 06:47.005
So, the girl asked her mother
why she tied the legs together,

06:47.007 --> 06:51.008
and her mother replied, "That's
the way my mother did it."

06:51.010 --> 06:53.019
When the girl asked
her grandmother why she did it

06:53.021 --> 06:58.006
that way, her grandmother said,
"That's how my mother did it."

06:58.008 --> 06:59.022
When she asked
her great grandmother

07:00.000 --> 07:02.020
why it was important to tie
the chicken legs together,

07:02.022 --> 07:05.010
her great grandmother
replied,

07:05.012 --> 07:08.019
"That's the only way
it would fit in my pot."

07:08.021 --> 07:10.014
I'm not following.

07:10.016 --> 07:12.016
And also hungry.
I follow.

07:12.018 --> 07:15.006
All you need to do now
is enter the Hall of Mooms

07:15.008 --> 07:17.008
and find out
which of your ancestors

07:17.010 --> 07:19.023
started this hubbub
inside you.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.001
All my
female ancestors.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.010
Yeah, I had to fight
a real messed up

07:35.012 --> 07:37.000
horse demon
for this baby.

07:37.002 --> 07:38.018
Do you want to know
how I lost me eye?

07:38.020 --> 07:42.004
The new blood is nigh.

07:42.006 --> 07:43.012
And this is
from your mind's eye,

07:43.014 --> 07:45.020
or did you just
feel the draft?

07:45.022 --> 07:48.022
Hi. I'm Oscar.
Are you the strongest ancestor?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.013
Advanced placement
macroeconomics

07:50.015 --> 07:54.002
and theoretical statistics
should be on the syllabus.

07:54.004 --> 07:56.000
Why should that matter
that she's in the seventh grade

07:56.002 --> 07:57.012
if she isn't
being challenged?

07:57.014 --> 07:58.013
Mom?
What?

07:58.015 --> 08:00.012
Hedgehog, I'm busy.

08:00.014 --> 08:03.002
Can you, um,
get on this broom?

08:03.004 --> 08:05.016
Why would I get
on a broom?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.020
For fun.

08:06.022 --> 08:08.020
Hedgehog that is
incredibly dangerous

08:08.022 --> 08:11.001
and a complete
waste of time.

08:11.003 --> 08:14.000
Can you hold it
then, please?

08:14.002 --> 08:16.000
Why are you holding it
like that?

08:16.002 --> 08:19.001
I don't know.
It just feels safest.

08:19.003 --> 08:20.008
Safest?

08:20.010 --> 08:22.021
Hedgehog, don't you have
homework to finish?

08:22.023 --> 08:24.006
Uh, yes, hello.

08:24.008 --> 08:25.017
Grandma!

08:25.019 --> 08:28.008
Oh, my hedge baby.

08:28.010 --> 08:30.008
What's that
you've got there?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.006
Wow.
How old are you?

08:32.008 --> 08:34.010
And what traits of Hedgehog
do you think you have?

08:34.012 --> 08:35.017
And who
do I talk to about

08:35.019 --> 08:37.022
getting a copy of the key
to this place?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.014
Oh, I have to go.

08:39.016 --> 08:40.018
Bye, Grandma.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.023
Hedgehog.

08:42.001 --> 08:43.018
Hi.
This is Esther.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.006
She has your ears.

08:45.008 --> 08:48.006
I'm your great grandmother,
dear.

08:48.008 --> 08:51.021
Um, Esther, would you mind
holding my broom, please?

08:51.023 --> 08:54.022
Ohh.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.003
Esther, why do you sit
like that?

08:57.005 --> 08:59.006
This is how you fly.

08:59.008 --> 09:01.018
Well, i-it's
how I was taught.

09:01.020 --> 09:03.003
Who taught you?

09:03.005 --> 09:04.009
My mother.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.017
Can you
point her out?

09:05.019 --> 09:07.015
There she is.

09:07.017 --> 09:09.006
Thank you.
Come on, Oscar.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.013
And my mother was taught
by her mother,

09:11.015 --> 09:14.020
and her mother by her mother
before her.

09:14.022 --> 09:18.002
And before her,
her mom's mom.

09:18.004 --> 09:20.005
Um, thank you,
Margaret.

09:22.001 --> 09:25.013
Ugh, we're never gonna find her.
There are too many Mooms.

09:25.015 --> 09:29.006
How are we supposed to find
the one that started this?

09:29.008 --> 09:31.021
I'll never
ride a broom.

09:31.023 --> 09:35.005
Spot the difference.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.014
Hm.

09:37.016 --> 09:39.021
No. Eh?

09:39.023 --> 09:41.006
Hm.

09:41.008 --> 09:45.005
One is not like the others.

09:45.007 --> 09:47.013
Hello?
Hello.

09:47.015 --> 09:52.017
Um, I was wondering -- Could
you, uh, hold this broom for me?

09:52.019 --> 09:56.005
She's magnificent.

09:56.007 --> 09:58.006
Why do you sit
like that?

09:58.008 --> 09:59.020
Because my hair is red.

09:59.022 --> 10:02.014
If I fly sitting up everyone
will see me,

10:02.016 --> 10:05.016
and I'll be a sitting
duck for witch hunters.

10:05.018 --> 10:08.008
Witch hunters?
Ohhh.

10:08.010 --> 10:10.002
That makes total sense.

10:10.004 --> 10:12.014
But I don't need to be
afraid of that.

10:12.016 --> 10:14.013
Seems you found
the source.

10:14.015 --> 10:17.001
Do you want
to try again?

10:24.016 --> 10:26.018
Whoa. Whoa!

10:26.020 --> 10:29.012
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

10:33.009 --> 10:36.005
That was some pumpkins.

10:36.007 --> 10:39.000
You want to go for it

10:56.019 --> 11:00.013
