WEBVTT

01:23.585 --> 01:27.254
We are all born to dream.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.825
It is the very purpose
of our mind.

01:30.858 --> 01:34.862
And when we are young,
our dreams are vivid,

01:34.896 --> 01:37.765
crystal clear.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.772
My grandson, Savino,

01:44.806 --> 01:47.140
he is a dreamer.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.412
When Savino was six years old,

01:52.446 --> 01:55.550
Felipe, his father,
had uprooted the family

01:55.583 --> 01:59.754
and his brother, Goyo,
from their vineyards in Spain

01:59.787 --> 02:04.224
to begin life anew
on the other side of the world.

02:04.257 --> 02:05.827
He had his reasons,

02:05.860 --> 02:09.764
but he never shared them
with Savino.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.734
What parent ever does?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.303
Savino, sit down and say grace.

02:29.691 --> 02:35.030
God bless all the gifts we are receiving
thanks to your generosity.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.283
Bless all those
who share them at this table.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.411
Dad, Mum, Grandpa, Grandma

02:41.453 --> 02:43.622
Uncle Goyo and...

02:53.966 --> 02:55.801
Savino. Finish.

02:57.477 --> 02:58.613
And his girlfriend.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.516
- Amen.
- Amen.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.216
Amen.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.186
It smells burned.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.271
That's because it is burned.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.391
And what is my grandson gonna do

03:11.425 --> 03:12.994
on his very special day?

03:13.027 --> 03:14.866
- What plan do you have?
- I don't have a plan.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.822
Savino, don't speak with your mouth full.

03:25.707 --> 03:27.608
Okay.

03:27.642 --> 03:30.310
- Be a good boy.
- I will.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.646
- And eat everything.
- I will.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.663
Savino? Savino.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.214
Wait!

03:34.256 --> 03:37.551
Put this on. Don't get sunburnt.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.827
Papa, I'm going
to high school next term.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.020
What? I'm not allowed
to kiss my son any more?

03:48.062 --> 03:49.396
It's nothing.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.565
See ya!

03:58.773 --> 04:00.508
Nice hat, mate!

04:10.852 --> 04:16.456
As parents, we try our best
to protect our children,

04:16.490 --> 04:19.694
to shield them
from the tides of life.

04:21.461 --> 04:25.800
But we often cast stones
into the waters of their youth.

04:27.568 --> 04:31.773
And those ripples
can last a lifetime.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.476
We've always had
practical reasons

04:36.511 --> 04:39.814
why we look at stars,
and up until recently,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.883
anyone taking a long journey

04:41.916 --> 04:45.352
would have navigated
by star charts.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.855
This constellation,
this was used to navigate

04:47.889 --> 04:50.792
around our half of the world,
the Southern Hemisphere,

04:50.825 --> 04:52.927
like the Pole Star was
by travelers

04:52.960 --> 04:54.762
in the northern part
of the world.

04:54.796 --> 05:00.735
And these two Centauri,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.637
here and here,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.337
these are called the pointers,

05:04.371 --> 05:08.976
because they point
to the Southern Cross.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.915
- Where'd you get the phone?
- I found it.

05:13.948 --> 05:15.482
- Really?
- Well, I need it

05:15.516 --> 05:18.519
- so I can text my dad.
- Mm.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.990
See this guy?

05:23.024 --> 05:24.058
You be him.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.594
You're about to get an arrow
through the heart.

05:28.563 --> 05:30.531
Look what I found today.

05:30.565 --> 05:31.899
Yeah, great.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.134
Weirdness.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.469
And I found this, too.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.714
Sick.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.091
Oh, shit!

05:59.492 --> 06:01.662
He's gonna kill me.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.836
Dude, slow down!

06:08.870 --> 06:10.004
Who's dying?

06:10.037 --> 06:13.440
Me, if I'm not home
soon enough!

06:13.473 --> 06:15.743
He's not gonna shoot you, is he?

06:19.914 --> 06:22.183
Why are you still following me?

06:22.216 --> 06:23.718
I don't know.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.418
Takes time for me to think.

06:27.021 --> 06:29.123
He's out there.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
Okay, this way, come on.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.241
Where have you been?

06:49.076 --> 06:51.495
We were playing and we lost track of time.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.289
Ah, so you lost track of time.
You suddenly became an idiot?

06:54.331 --> 06:55.207
What is he doing here?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.459
He's my friend.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.153
I thought your dad
spoke English.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.621
Of course I speak English.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.507
Get in the house.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.931
Forgive me for any wrongdoing.

07:09.964 --> 07:11.599
And if Dad
could forgive me, too,

07:11.632 --> 07:13.000
that'd be great.

07:13.034 --> 07:15.803
Bless all of my family
and my friend, Skeet.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.005
And if, in your eternal wisdom,

07:18.039 --> 07:20.808
you could consider
a blessing for me on this day,

07:20.841 --> 07:23.678
that'd be really great,
thank you.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.546
Amen.

07:34.989 --> 07:40.628
It takes courage to accept
and embrace our own story.

07:40.661 --> 07:44.497
For we are afraid
that people might not like us

07:44.532 --> 07:47.868
if they know the truth
about who we are

07:47.902 --> 07:49.770
or where we come from.

07:56.077 --> 08:01.749
But there is a yearning
deep inside us all

08:01.782 --> 08:05.485
to know more
about what came before.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.238
Good morning.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.032
Hello, good morning.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.701
Have you come with the family
that has rented the house?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.287
Rented? No not rented.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.080
American?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.373
No Australian.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.542
Wow, I have heard that place is beautiful.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.545
Yes, this is beautiful too.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.633
I was looking for my father's house.

08:28.926 --> 08:29.801
Your father?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.515
You're saying that
this is your father's house?

08:34.890 --> 08:36.140
Yes, my father.

08:38.152 --> 08:39.620
Felipe?

08:40.229 --> 08:42.063
You are Felipe's son?

08:47.194 --> 08:50.197
- Sorpresa!
- Sorpresa!

09:14.221 --> 09:15.589
Okay, which present first?

09:15.623 --> 09:17.324
- The big one?
- That's mine.

09:17.358 --> 09:18.726
Oooh!

09:21.295 --> 09:22.863
- Ah!
- It's a game,

09:22.897 --> 09:25.299
but it makes you think.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.834
That one's from me, Janine.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.274
Oh, cool!
Maths instruments, thanks!

09:33.307 --> 09:35.276
It's like a ruler and stuff.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.078
Don't know how
to show you how to use them.

09:37.111 --> 09:38.612
Open this one.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.915
I chose this for you,
especially this year.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.717
You know, Savino,
something I think

09:43.751 --> 09:45.352
you will really treasure.

09:45.386 --> 09:50.057
This is your history,
our history.

09:50.091 --> 09:51.659
You see here?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.095
Our father,
your grandfather, Antonio,

09:54.128 --> 09:56.797
gave this to me
on my 12th birthday.

09:56.831 --> 09:58.866
So now it's yours.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.669
And you can put your name
under us.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.337
- Do you like it?
- Thanks, it's nice.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.272
Three generations.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.242
You can read a bit of it,

10:08.275 --> 10:10.344
now we are all together,
if you want.

10:10.377 --> 10:14.014
I think I'll read it later
when I can really appreciate it.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.382
Okay.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.017
Thank you.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.152
It's okay.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.087
- It's great.
- Bravo, Felipe.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.690
They are socks.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.925
But your grandfather
has a gift for you

10:24.959 --> 10:26.160
that you might really like.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.032
All right, let's see.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.334
Socks. Warm feet.

10:35.836 --> 10:40.307
Luis, give Savvy
a proper present.

10:40.341 --> 10:43.310
What do you mean,
"proper present," Maribel?

10:43.344 --> 10:46.147
What is the point
of saying that?

10:46.180 --> 10:47.715
It's okay.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.284
We could give this another day.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.120
Oh, come on, it's a present.

10:53.154 --> 10:54.121
He's gotta open it.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.706
Happy Birthday, my grandson.

11:05.132 --> 11:08.369
Look, your name. Savino.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.412
Savino.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.248
I didn't know you were going
to put his name in your book.

11:21.282 --> 11:23.250
It's okay, no problem, Luis.

11:23.284 --> 11:24.919
I'm going to work.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.087
The water can wait.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.109
What the...?

11:49.143 --> 11:50.177
Are you shitting me?

11:50.211 --> 11:52.514
We got shoes! We got new shoes!

12:31.586 --> 12:33.287
Is this telescope
powerful enough

12:33.320 --> 12:37.057
to see other galaxies
and stuff like that?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.327
Powerful enough, yes.

12:40.361 --> 12:43.430
That's a good word.

12:43.464 --> 12:47.301
I do not know
what you are going to see, son.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.870
This is your adventure now.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.908
What?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.944
You do not believe me?

12:59.446 --> 13:02.082
Maybe you're not ready.

13:02.116 --> 13:05.019
But one day you will be ready
and you will know.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.154
You will see it.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.823
See what?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.458
I've given you the tools.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.262
Use your eyes, Savino.

14:50.525 --> 14:52.092
You should knock.

14:52.126 --> 14:54.328
Your grandmother and I
could be doing something

14:54.361 --> 14:57.565
not meant for a boy's eyes.

14:57.599 --> 15:00.334
Unlikely, but you never know.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.640
What?

15:05.673 --> 15:06.823
I saw something.

15:06.865 --> 15:07.741
What's happening?

15:08.710 --> 15:10.310
Oh, sweetheart.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.713
It's too early!

15:11.746 --> 15:13.447
Come back when I'm beautiful.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.956
You're always beautiful my sweet.

15:17.752 --> 15:19.486
Go on.

15:19.521 --> 15:21.121
Okay, so I saw
the Southern Cross.

15:21.155 --> 15:22.356
- Yes.
- And it was pointing

15:22.389 --> 15:25.192
- to this rock.
- Which rock?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.430
He's trying to tell me.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.297
Nah.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.699
- No, don't worry about it.
- Hey.

15:31.733 --> 15:33.668
- It sounds stupid.
- Stop.

15:33.701 --> 15:35.737
- Go on.
- Okay.

15:35.770 --> 15:38.706
Well, I found this rock
with my telescope.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.074
There were these colors.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.309
Oh, yeah,
and there was a shadow

15:42.342 --> 15:45.212
of this really big bird.

15:45.245 --> 15:49.450
And... and then another one,
but this time a golden one,

15:49.483 --> 15:52.052
and it wasn't as big,
but it was a golden bird,

15:52.085 --> 15:53.987
and it flew up over the rock.

15:55.456 --> 15:57.491
- That rock.
- Shh.

15:57.525 --> 15:59.359
- Do you know the place?
- Yes.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.094
It's a beautiful place.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.764
Come on, tell me.

16:02.797 --> 16:06.099
Can I... can I go there?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.735
I don't know, can you?

16:07.769 --> 16:09.236
How do I get there?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.305
You know how.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.740
Follow the stars.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.983
Savino should be out in the sunshine.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.612
It's the holidays
and he is stuck in this dark hole.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.288
Mama.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.531
It's true...

16:29.865 --> 16:32.284
...he needs some brothers
to run around with...

16:32.743 --> 16:34.780
...out on his bike like normal children.

16:34.829 --> 16:37.097
You don't want your grandson
to have an education?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.666
- Is that it?
- What I am saying

16:38.700 --> 16:41.569
is that he should have
some sunshine, too.

16:41.603 --> 16:46.273
You don't think he needs
to learn how to run this place?

16:46.306 --> 16:48.375
Who else is going to do that?

16:48.408 --> 16:51.144
You? Or him?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.113
You think he could do it?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.582
I could do it.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.651
Give me a few weeks,
and I'm running this thing.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.564
He doesn't trust you at all.

17:06.828 --> 17:09.531
A family from Barcelona
bought the house

17:09.564 --> 17:11.566
when your father
decided to leave.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.502
They use it as a holiday home.

17:14.536 --> 17:17.705
I take care of the vineyards,

17:17.739 --> 17:20.742
and my wife
looks after the house.

17:20.775 --> 17:22.810
As we did with your family.

17:32.754 --> 17:34.121
See that house?

17:34.154 --> 17:35.690
That's where I live.

17:35.723 --> 17:38.660
Let's go, meet my family.

17:38.693 --> 17:40.695
What do you have to write about?

17:40.728 --> 17:42.564
- Family.
- Perfect.

17:42.597 --> 17:44.532
So you can write
about how we made

17:44.566 --> 17:47.502
one of the most beautiful wines
in Spain.

17:47.535 --> 17:48.736
This.

17:48.770 --> 17:50.872
Our Tempranillo '65,

17:50.905 --> 17:54.542
the finest we ever produced.

17:54.576 --> 17:55.877
But you never drink wine.

17:55.910 --> 17:57.210
You don't have to drink it.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.846
It's enough to taste it.

18:01.315 --> 18:03.585
That's not what Uncle Goyo says.

18:04.719 --> 18:08.590
Yeah. Tio Goyo's a wine expert.

18:08.623 --> 18:13.393
And this is the only bottle
I brought from Spain

18:13.427 --> 18:15.362
worth the price of a ruby,

18:15.395 --> 18:18.365
and your inheritance
right here, Savino.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.767
But be careful.

18:19.801 --> 18:23.303
An old wine
can be disturbed easily.

18:23.838 --> 18:25.640
Look.

18:25.673 --> 18:29.544
Made from the grapes
of your old family vineyards.

18:29.577 --> 18:31.813
- Wow.
- Give it to your father.

18:33.681 --> 18:37.819
Dad used to have a bottle
of wine like this, but...

18:39.486 --> 18:42.724
but he doesn't have his anymore.

18:42.757 --> 18:47.194
I wonder what life would
have been like for my family

18:47.227 --> 18:48.563
if we all stayed here.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.299
Tomorrow I will take you
somewhere

18:52.332 --> 18:53.735
before you leave.

18:57.939 --> 18:59.574
Savino, come here.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.276
- Try.
- Mhm.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.788
Smell it.

19:13.821 --> 19:16.624
You see? Sweet.

19:16.658 --> 19:19.794
Did your father teach you
and Tio Goyo how to make wine?

19:19.827 --> 19:21.663
Yes.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.498
I wish you could meet him.

19:24.532 --> 19:26.834
Your grandfather
showed me everything.

19:26.868 --> 19:27.935
Now I am teaching you.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.743
Perfect, you see?

19:35.777 --> 19:37.945
Now...

19:37.979 --> 19:40.882
I can't listen
to Felipe's crap any more.

19:40.915 --> 19:43.551
- Do you want a smoke?
- Yeah.

19:45.620 --> 19:48.355
He only talks
about the good times,

19:48.388 --> 19:49.456
before our father changed.

19:50.825 --> 19:53.594
I think it's time
to go to dinner, Savino.

19:53.628 --> 19:55.395
- See you later.
- See you.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.635
Tio Goyo.

20:00.668 --> 20:02.537
- It's dinner time.
- Okay.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.811
Bueno.

20:09.844 --> 20:13.246
Paella, paella.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.574
It's so special
having you here, Savino.

20:39.607 --> 20:41.809
I've thought
about your father a lot.

20:41.843 --> 20:43.845
Did he ever talk to you
about his life here

20:43.878 --> 20:46.446
and why he left
and went to Australia?

20:46.480 --> 20:49.382
- Kind of.
- He is a good man.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.551
He deserves happiness.

20:50.585 --> 20:53.855
Most people do, I suppose,
but especially your father.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.717
Let's have a family toast to Savino...

20:58.759 --> 21:00.719
...who has come from
the other side of the world...

21:00.761 --> 21:02.221
...just to try my wife's paella!

21:21.549 --> 21:22.617
Hi.

21:22.650 --> 21:23.684
How you doing?

21:23.718 --> 21:25.720
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

21:25.753 --> 21:27.487
What are you doing, Savvy?

21:27.522 --> 21:29.356
I'm learning
the family business.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.758
- You know, for my essay.
- Good.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.795
Yeah, Tio Goyo is teaching me

21:33.828 --> 21:35.997
how to taste wines
from different years.

21:36.030 --> 21:40.701
Yes, I'm showing him
how this works, more or less.

21:40.735 --> 21:41.803
It's good.

21:47.775 --> 21:49.944
You have to move it.

21:49.977 --> 21:50.912
Open it.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.998
2002.

22:11.032 --> 22:13.333
- Correct?
- Probably.

22:14.635 --> 22:15.503
What's wrong?

22:19.707 --> 22:20.942
You let him drink?

22:20.975 --> 22:22.844
He's 12 years old.

22:22.877 --> 22:23.911
Just a little.

22:23.945 --> 22:25.646
I'm sorry, Felipe,
just a little.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.014
We did this in Spain.

22:27.048 --> 22:28.649
I mean,
there's no problem with it.

22:28.683 --> 22:30.117
We are not in Spain.

22:30.151 --> 22:32.620
What do you have in your head?

22:32.653 --> 22:34.755
You wanna tell your son
about the family business?

22:34.789 --> 22:36.423
Tell him how our father
ran the business,

22:36.456 --> 22:37.692
because the way
I remember things,

22:37.725 --> 22:39.026
he drank the most of it.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.027
That's what he did.

22:40.061 --> 22:42.462
And you are drinking the rest,
aren't you?

22:42.495 --> 22:43.297
I am not like him.

22:43.331 --> 22:44.999
I got nothing,
as you like to say,

22:45.032 --> 22:45.933
but I'm enjoying life.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.602
I'm a good man
and I'm enjoying life.

22:47.635 --> 22:48.669
Can you say that?

22:48.703 --> 22:50.071
You got a great family
and you run the business,

22:50.104 --> 22:51.939
but you're the sad man, not me.

22:59.647 --> 23:00.948
Drink it.

23:07.822 --> 23:08.723
I'm not a baby.

23:08.756 --> 23:11.058
Ah, you're not a baby,
you're a man.

23:11.092 --> 23:12.093
A drinking man.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.998
You are not going
to walk from this room

23:17.031 --> 23:18.099
till you sober up.

23:18.132 --> 23:19.834
Do you understand me?

23:19.867 --> 23:21.168
Yeah.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.138
Perfect.

23:24.171 --> 23:26.741
And from now on,
you are going to work

23:26.774 --> 23:28.576
in a place where I can see you.

23:28.609 --> 23:31.646
With me.

24:05.613 --> 24:07.581
How are we doing?

24:07.615 --> 24:09.884
We are doing all right.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.986
For a family of seven
with two workers.

24:13.788 --> 24:15.189
Mom and Dad and five kids.

24:20.027 --> 24:21.494
We should've had more children.

24:25.666 --> 24:27.902
I just think
it's hard for Savvy.

25:13.581 --> 25:16.317
Oh! You dirty bastard!

25:16.350 --> 25:18.919
- You nearly got me then.
- Shh, shh!

25:18.953 --> 25:20.921
- What are you doing here?
- Let's go out.

25:20.955 --> 25:22.623
Let's do something.

25:22.656 --> 25:25.259
- I can't.
- Just come down.

25:40.274 --> 25:41.742
Hurry up.

25:43.677 --> 25:44.845
Shh!

25:47.681 --> 25:49.717
- Quiet.
- Catch this, okay?

25:49.750 --> 25:50.718
Go.

25:54.388 --> 25:56.223
Come on, I've got you.

25:56.257 --> 25:57.324
Go.

26:02.129 --> 26:03.564
Sorry, mate.

26:10.204 --> 26:13.641
- You smell like the pub.
- Yeah, I know.

26:13.674 --> 26:15.743
- Are you pissed?
- Off my face.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.749
Come on, let's get out of here.

26:21.782 --> 26:24.151
You didn't reply to my signals.

26:24.185 --> 26:26.353
What was your message?

26:26.387 --> 26:31.692
Light, dark, light, dark,
light, light, light, dark.

26:31.725 --> 26:34.328
That's very informative, Skeet.

26:34.361 --> 26:35.696
Wait here.

26:37.998 --> 26:39.700
We don't need water.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.936
We will
where we're going, buddy.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.272
Quiet.

26:47.374 --> 26:49.243
So where are we going?

26:49.276 --> 26:51.045
We're going to this place.

26:51.078 --> 26:54.215
My pops told me,
out past Emu Plains,

26:54.248 --> 26:56.750
there's a rock,
something strange to see.

26:56.784 --> 26:59.220
- See what?
- I don't know.

26:59.253 --> 27:01.722
Mate, this is gonna be sick.

27:01.755 --> 27:02.957
I guess so.

27:53.307 --> 27:54.775
Can you see it?

27:54.808 --> 27:55.843
The Milky Way.

27:55.876 --> 27:56.877
Cool.

27:56.911 --> 28:00.948
I need the Southern Cross
to show us the way.

28:00.981 --> 28:03.284
The stars are gonna
get us there?

28:03.317 --> 28:04.852
Yeah.

28:04.885 --> 28:07.454
Well, that's
what my granddad said.

28:09.323 --> 28:11.258
How old is he again?

28:16.063 --> 28:18.899
Are you gonna be doing that
the whole way?

28:18.933 --> 28:20.167
Yeah.

28:20.201 --> 28:22.036
We gotta let the snakes know
we're coming.

28:22.069 --> 28:23.470
Yeah, right.

28:25.105 --> 28:26.508
Seriously.

28:26.541 --> 28:29.210
It's the brown ones
you've really gotta worry about.

28:29.243 --> 28:30.911
They've got these tiny fangs

28:30.945 --> 28:34.114
and their venom
just thins your blood.

28:34.148 --> 28:38.252
You won't feel a thing,
but then you just drop dead.

28:38.285 --> 28:39.954
That's gross!

28:52.132 --> 28:54.068
Did you know
there are more stars

28:54.101 --> 28:56.337
than there are grains of sand?

28:56.370 --> 28:58.305
Really?

28:58.339 --> 28:59.440
Yeah.

28:59.473 --> 29:02.409
Or something like that.

29:02.443 --> 29:05.312
It's like millions
of tiny little eyes

29:05.346 --> 29:08.282
just staring down on us.

29:08.315 --> 29:10.017
Hey, look.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.319
A satellite.

29:12.353 --> 29:15.022
- Where is it?
- There.

29:15.055 --> 29:16.423
There's thousands of them
up there.

29:18.192 --> 29:21.428
Most of them
stopped working ages ago.

29:21.462 --> 29:25.232
They're still up there,
just trying to find a signal.

29:29.937 --> 29:32.373
Do you have maps
on that phone of yours?

29:32.406 --> 29:34.842
No.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.311
You know you can get apps
that have star maps on it?

29:37.344 --> 29:39.947
I don't want that shit
on my phone.

29:39.980 --> 29:42.216
I've just got the games I like.

29:42.249 --> 29:44.285
It's just for texting my dad.

29:48.055 --> 29:52.192
- What did he say?
- I haven't texted him yet.

29:52.226 --> 29:53.394
Why not?

29:55.262 --> 29:56.531
I'm just working out
what to say.

29:56.564 --> 29:58.866
- Do you even know his number?
- Yes.

30:02.903 --> 30:05.439
You just gotta
find the right words.

30:05.472 --> 30:06.907
That's it.

30:08.576 --> 30:10.844
There's something biting my leg.

30:10.878 --> 30:11.945
Oh.

30:14.348 --> 30:16.483
- Oh!
- Shit!

30:20.187 --> 30:23.090
- Get them off my back.
- Yeah.

30:23.123 --> 30:24.224
Let's go.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.563
The bag, you dickhead, get it!

30:32.399 --> 30:33.467
Shit.

30:35.235 --> 30:36.604
What am I even doing out here?

30:36.638 --> 30:39.106
I don't even believe
there's any stupid rock.

30:39.139 --> 30:40.908
Your crazy grandfather
made it up.

30:40.941 --> 30:42.242
He did not.

30:42.276 --> 30:43.578
Is he still all there
in the head?

30:43.611 --> 30:45.846
He's smarter
than anyone else I know.

31:01.395 --> 31:02.963
Which way now?

31:02.996 --> 31:05.032
I don't know.

31:05.065 --> 31:08.001
- For fuck's sake.
- I'm looking.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.604
I'm going home.

31:09.637 --> 31:10.605
Wait, wait.

31:10.638 --> 31:12.239
Wait, wait!

31:13.307 --> 31:14.642
Give me your phone.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.914
No reception.

31:25.386 --> 31:28.055
You should have told
your freaky father we're coming.

31:28.088 --> 31:30.391
- He's not a freak.
- He is too.

31:32.527 --> 31:34.428
He's a bit of a freak.

31:34.461 --> 31:37.131
Did you ever think
maybe our dads

31:37.164 --> 31:39.567
would like it
if we died out here?

31:47.307 --> 31:50.010
And they wouldn't have
to pretend to care anymore?

31:57.752 --> 31:59.019
That's not good for you.

32:03.190 --> 32:05.993
You think that's
my main concern right now?

32:08.663 --> 32:10.497
Can I have a puff?

32:23.243 --> 32:25.680
You're not getting
any better at it, are you?

32:25.713 --> 32:27.381
Get lost.

32:30.518 --> 32:33.353
Maybe your dad was hoping
for you to go out to the desert

32:33.387 --> 32:35.590
and never come back.

32:35.623 --> 32:37.625
Then he wouldn't have
to worry about paying

32:37.659 --> 32:40.160
for your clothes or your food,

32:40.194 --> 32:45.432
or coming to see you,
or texting you back.

32:45.466 --> 32:47.434
Or anything like that.

32:51.506 --> 32:56.376
Maybe he'd like it if you just
fell off the face of the earth,

32:56.410 --> 32:58.713
'cause he doesn't
give a shit about you.

33:06.754 --> 33:08.756
I just disappoint him.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.696
I don't know what he wants.

33:15.797 --> 33:17.331
Not me.

33:21.603 --> 33:24.404
I'm not the kid he wants.

33:38.285 --> 33:39.554
Savino?

33:49.496 --> 33:51.733
See? Woo-hoo!

33:55.235 --> 33:56.236
Get a move on.

33:56.270 --> 33:58.305
- Come on.
- Shut up.

34:12.386 --> 34:13.755
- Come on.
- Thank you.

34:13.788 --> 34:15.088
Go on.

34:51.491 --> 34:53.493
Give us a look.

34:58.533 --> 35:01.401
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.

35:01.435 --> 35:03.771
I can see a whole heap

35:03.805 --> 35:05.573
of nothingness.

35:09.376 --> 35:11.278
This isn't right.

35:15.315 --> 35:19.286
You know the problem
with your grandfather's stories?

35:19.319 --> 35:21.455
There's no fucking ending.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.760
Give it here.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.562
For fuck's sake.

35:29.664 --> 35:32.332
I can see the lights
of our town.

35:32.366 --> 35:33.601
I can see the way straight back.

35:33.635 --> 35:34.936
Come on, let's go.

35:34.969 --> 35:37.137
Hurry up, let's go, move it!

35:42.409 --> 35:43.443
Skeet?

35:44.478 --> 35:45.546
Fucking hell.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.682
No, no, no, no, no.

35:49.951 --> 35:51.586
Shit, no.

36:13.541 --> 36:14.542
Where is Savino?

36:14.758 --> 36:17.135
What happened? Have you no manners?

36:17.177 --> 36:19.096
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he should be in his room!

36:19.137 --> 36:20.514
- He's not there.
- What do you mean he's not there?

36:21.348 --> 36:22.917
Luis, do you have an idea
where is he?

36:28.656 --> 36:31.491
Where did you send my son, Luis?

36:44.839 --> 36:46.440
Skeet? Skeet!

36:57.585 --> 36:59.386
Fuck.

36:59.419 --> 37:00.888
Skeet, Skeet.

37:15.737 --> 37:18.305
Fuck, fuck.

37:37.457 --> 37:38.926
What the fuck
are you gonna do with that?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.668
- Savino!
- Shit.

38:22.435 --> 38:24.005
What happened?

38:24.038 --> 38:26.406
Skeet kind of fell.

38:37.852 --> 38:40.087
Savino, you stay here.

38:40.121 --> 38:43.124
Could you drop me
round the back?

38:43.157 --> 38:45.693
I'm going to deliver you
to your father.

38:45.726 --> 38:47.695
It's just my mom now.

38:47.728 --> 38:48.830
And don't wake her up.

38:54.769 --> 38:55.837
Before eating, Savino,

38:55.870 --> 38:57.905
tell me what
your grandfather said.

38:57.939 --> 39:00.407
I can tell you
exactly what I told him.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.709
But I want my son to tell me.

39:02.810 --> 39:04.111
It's my fault.

39:04.145 --> 39:07.648
When you make a mistake,
and we all do,

39:07.682 --> 39:09.717
it is not your fault.

39:09.750 --> 39:12.553
Eat up now, Savvy.

39:12.587 --> 39:14.421
What? I'm the problem here?

39:14.454 --> 39:17.758
He's the one who sends Savvy
into the desert.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.594
I thought he would talk to you.

39:19.627 --> 39:21.996
- Why he would do that?
- Because you're his father.

39:22.029 --> 39:23.496
Look at him. Luis, no.

39:23.531 --> 39:24.866
Please, look at him.

39:24.899 --> 39:25.967
You see?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.768
He has no words for me.

39:27.802 --> 39:29.103
- Hello.
- You have a problem!

39:29.136 --> 39:30.605
I'm trying to eat
my breakfast here.

39:30.638 --> 39:32.006
- A big one!
- The most important meal

39:32.039 --> 39:33.473
- of the day.
- Tell your mother

39:33.507 --> 39:35.176
to stay out of this.

39:35.209 --> 39:38.045
- Stay out of it, Mama.
- No, I will not.

39:38.079 --> 39:41.515
I've got my health to consider.

39:41.549 --> 39:43.651
Did you see it, Savino?

39:43.684 --> 39:45.119
Did you look hard enough
to find it?

39:45.152 --> 39:47.622
Answer to your grandfather,
Savino.

39:47.655 --> 39:48.623
Did you see anything?

39:50.658 --> 39:53.127
- Did you use the telescope?
- Yes, he looked!

39:53.160 --> 39:54.762
But he didn't see anything

39:54.795 --> 39:56.797
because there is nothing
up there.

39:56.831 --> 39:58.132
One day you will see it.

39:58.165 --> 39:59.834
Not another time, please!

39:59.867 --> 40:02.503
Stop your crazy dreaming,
putting my son at risk!

40:02.536 --> 40:04.639
Stop! Stop!

40:04.672 --> 40:07.575
- Sweet Jesus.
- I can point a finger, too.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.713
Adrianna.

40:14.048 --> 40:16.150
Get your parents
out of my house.

40:16.183 --> 40:17.852
- What?
- Calm down, please.

40:17.885 --> 40:18.786
I will calm down

40:18.819 --> 40:21.923
when your parents
were out of my house.

40:21.956 --> 40:23.691
- It's their house, too.
- No, no.

40:23.724 --> 40:25.492
This is our house, Savino.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.994
You have to understand that.

40:27.028 --> 40:29.096
This is the family,
your mother, you, and me.

40:29.130 --> 40:31.065
Felipe, por favor.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.066
Por favor, Felipe.

40:34.035 --> 40:34.869
No.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.144
Okay, Luis.

40:43.177 --> 40:46.681
I will not throw you out.

40:46.714 --> 40:50.217
Yes, it is time.

40:50.251 --> 40:51.686
Time for what?

40:51.719 --> 40:53.054
You don't have to pack today.

40:53.087 --> 40:54.889
I have already packed.

40:54.922 --> 40:57.158
Papa. But you can't.

40:57.191 --> 40:59.727
- You have nowhere to go.
- I will not be a burden

40:59.760 --> 41:02.063
for you any longer.

41:04.598 --> 41:05.599
Papa.

41:09.203 --> 41:11.038
Mama.

41:11.072 --> 41:12.239
Savino, go to your room.

41:38.599 --> 41:41.235
What's wrong with Pops?

41:41.268 --> 41:42.703
He's just getting older,
I guess.

41:49.844 --> 41:51.946
How can he be out there
working on his stupid car

41:51.979 --> 41:53.914
while they're leaving?

41:53.948 --> 41:55.916
He's hiding from us.

41:57.752 --> 42:00.187
Hiding?

42:00.221 --> 42:01.989
That's what he does, isn't it?

43:08.989 --> 43:11.659
Eat your food, Savino.

43:11.692 --> 43:14.295
We always wait for you, Felipe.

43:25.873 --> 43:28.676
Of all God's creatures,

43:28.709 --> 43:31.412
man is the only one
who sees fit

43:31.445 --> 43:34.415
to punish himself...

43:34.448 --> 43:37.885
over and over again.

43:40.821 --> 43:43.023
Good.

43:48.062 --> 43:52.366
And what is worse...

43:52.399 --> 43:57.404
we make our children
pay dearly for our mistakes.

44:32.139 --> 44:34.808
It's me again.

44:34.842 --> 44:37.978
If you can tell Mom to
come home now, that'd be great.

44:38.012 --> 44:40.714
I don't even know where she is.

44:42.750 --> 44:45.386
Savvy?

44:45.419 --> 44:49.056
Hello?

44:49.089 --> 44:53.394
I'm coming in. Is that alright?

44:53.427 --> 44:56.897
Do you think God speaks Spanish?

44:56.931 --> 45:01.402
I think it might be
his first language.

45:01.435 --> 45:05.139
- Nice room.
- Thanks.

45:14.014 --> 45:17.117
My 12th birthday
was pretty shit.

45:17.151 --> 45:18.452
But I'll tell you,

45:18.485 --> 45:19.954
no one ever gift-wrapped
school shoes

45:19.987 --> 45:21.755
and made me smile about it.

45:21.789 --> 45:23.190
That really, really sucks.

45:23.224 --> 45:23.958
I don't even know what that is.

45:23.991 --> 45:31.765
That's like weird medieval shit.

45:31.799 --> 45:34.868
You want your telescope back?

45:40.140 --> 45:43.444
Okay.

46:02.930 --> 46:05.232
Shit.

46:05.266 --> 46:06.100
Fuck.

46:06.133 --> 46:08.536
Shit.

46:08.570 --> 46:09.537
Felipe!

46:09.571 --> 46:11.138
Shit.

46:11.171 --> 46:12.873
- Felipe!
- Keep working.

46:12.906 --> 46:15.876
Um, help! Ah!

46:15.909 --> 46:16.944
- Oh, my God.
- Careful, careful.

46:16.977 --> 46:17.878
Oh, my God.

46:17.911 --> 46:19.046
I don't know what happened.

46:19.079 --> 46:21.815
I was washing dishes and I...

47:43.163 --> 47:44.932
Aren't you done yet?

47:44.965 --> 47:46.266
Almost.

47:46.300 --> 47:48.001
Finish up and then you can go.

47:48.035 --> 47:49.571
I have work to do.

48:05.953 --> 48:11.659
When a family breaks
into many pieces...

48:11.693 --> 48:19.266
when we feel forgotten
and unaccepted...

48:19.299 --> 48:24.138
a week can feel like a lifetime.

48:38.285 --> 48:40.622
You need to talk
to him yourself.

48:40.655 --> 48:43.991
- Is Pops sick?
- He's in the hospice.

48:44.024 --> 48:47.327
Why didn't you tell me?

48:47.361 --> 48:49.697
Come on, Savvy.

48:49.731 --> 48:53.066
Quick.

49:07.414 --> 49:12.286
It's here.

49:18.025 --> 49:21.161
Come in, sweetie.

49:23.380 --> 49:26.133
Ah, my beautiful girl and Savino.

49:29.169 --> 49:32.339
Come in.

49:46.253 --> 49:49.389
There they are.

49:49.423 --> 49:52.125
You're so beautiful.

49:52.159 --> 49:53.193
Maribel.

49:53.227 --> 49:55.195
Always so beautiful.

49:55.229 --> 49:57.264
We should have stayed there.

49:57.297 --> 49:59.767
We should have stayed in Spain.

49:59.801 --> 50:03.070
Maybe then you'd never
have got this cancer.

50:03.103 --> 50:09.343
Always so cheerful.

50:09.376 --> 50:14.816
You want me to smile
at your deathbed?

50:14.849 --> 50:16.116
Why not?

50:16.149 --> 50:19.152
I love your smile.

50:19.186 --> 50:22.422
Give it to me.

50:22.456 --> 50:25.225
Maybe in a minute.

50:29.463 --> 50:31.365
Go and talk with your grandpa.

50:31.398 --> 50:33.768
Okay?

50:36.838 --> 50:40.474
You should have told me sooner.

50:40.508 --> 50:42.075
Do not be frightened.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.877
He didn't want me to tell you.

50:45.128 --> 50:46.463
I didn't think it would be this fast.

50:46.588 --> 50:48.590
Leave me alone.

50:49.216 --> 50:56.490
Everyone loses
someone they love.

50:56.524 --> 51:01.161
This is half of your family

51:01.194 --> 51:05.098
and you must find
the other half.

51:05.132 --> 51:07.869
It is lost

51:07.902 --> 51:11.238
and only you can find it.

51:11.271 --> 51:13.173
Only you.

51:13.206 --> 51:15.877
Do you understand?

51:15.910 --> 51:17.879
No.

51:17.912 --> 51:20.280
You will find the way.

51:23.417 --> 51:28.121
I want to kiss your eyes.

51:28.155 --> 51:31.191
I want...

51:31.224 --> 51:33.895
to kiss your nose.

51:33.928 --> 51:36.330
Then I want to tickle you.

51:36.363 --> 51:42.336
I'm not a little kid any more.

51:42.369 --> 51:47.508
Then let us talk business.

51:47.542 --> 51:50.177
You have to go back

51:50.210 --> 51:53.581
and see the rock one more time.

51:53.615 --> 51:57.184
- I can't.
- In the light.

51:57.217 --> 51:59.386
Because I went there,
you're here.

51:59.419 --> 52:02.255
Make a better plan.

52:02.289 --> 52:03.925
Not without you.

52:09.964 --> 52:14.167
I am not necessary.

52:14.201 --> 52:17.905
That is how the world turns.

52:17.939 --> 52:20.942
Not too hard, darling.

52:20.975 --> 52:24.545
Lay down next to me.

52:48.536 --> 52:51.405
Adrianna.

52:51.438 --> 52:54.274
Where is your mother going?

52:54.307 --> 52:58.646
Go inside, Mama.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.313
Adrianna?

53:00.347 --> 53:02.315
My mother is going to her room.

53:02.349 --> 53:04.284
- She has to rest.
- She has no room here.

53:04.317 --> 53:05.485
This is our house.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.921
We have talked about this.

53:06.954 --> 53:07.955
She has to find another room.

53:07.989 --> 53:09.557
Felipe.

53:09.590 --> 53:11.291
- Take the bags in, sweetie.
- No.

53:11.324 --> 53:12.660
No, no, no,
put that on the floor.

53:12.694 --> 53:14.261
She just told me
to take them inside.

53:14.294 --> 53:15.897
- Put that on the floor.
- No.

53:15.930 --> 53:19.299
Felipe.

53:19.332 --> 53:23.437
I tell you
put that on the floor.

53:41.455 --> 53:44.347
Felipe, Felipe...

53:44.391 --> 53:46.643
...I need a hand.

53:48.645 --> 53:50.898
Felipe, I don't know how this works.

53:58.472 --> 53:59.974
Felipe.

54:00.007 --> 54:01.441
Felipe.

54:06.446 --> 54:09.316
Felipe,
give me a hand with this.

54:09.349 --> 54:13.020
It's not working.

54:13.212 --> 54:14.796
You ruined the family, you son of a bitch.

54:15.214 --> 54:16.423
Coward.

54:16.715 --> 54:18.759
What do you want? What do you want?

54:19.176 --> 54:21.303
What are you saying?
What the fuck are you saying?

54:31.605 --> 54:34.233
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

55:11.546 --> 55:18.351
You sit at my table
looking like this?

55:18.385 --> 55:22.422
My mother's home is with me now.

55:22.455 --> 55:29.096
She was staying with
my father in the hospice.

55:29.130 --> 55:32.667
He died last night.

55:32.700 --> 55:35.435
What?

55:57.825 --> 56:02.462
How are you gonna
live with that?

56:13.473 --> 56:16.409
I'm getting away from you
and this family.

56:16.443 --> 56:18.179
You are so fucked.

56:18.212 --> 56:19.747
You're gonna spend
the rest of your days

56:19.780 --> 56:21.816
locked up behind those shutters
in the dark,

56:21.849 --> 56:24.852
eating dust, snarling at each
other in fucking Spanish.

56:24.886 --> 56:27.420
That poor kid!

56:27.454 --> 56:28.421
- No.
- Take it easy.

56:28.455 --> 56:30.191
Give the rest of my shit
to your next girlfriend.

56:30.224 --> 56:32.459
I feel sorry for her.

57:08.629 --> 57:11.866
He doesn't want any sad clothes.

57:11.899 --> 57:17.605
He wants dominoes
and music played at supper...

57:17.638 --> 57:21.909
and...

57:21.943 --> 57:24.512
This bit is very personal.

57:24.545 --> 57:29.482
So I don't want to read
about how he liked me

57:29.517 --> 57:32.253
in my green dress
with a red net petticoat.

57:32.286 --> 57:34.221
Aw, Mama, no.

57:34.255 --> 57:36.257
Everybody liked me in that.

57:36.290 --> 57:38.225
I was spectacular.

57:38.259 --> 57:39.794
Yeah.

57:39.827 --> 57:41.862
And...

57:42.087 --> 57:47.217
He wants you to make lots of food...

57:51.096 --> 57:55.601
...and for us to drink
the Tempranillo '65 from the study.

57:55.642 --> 57:58.228
Mama, that's not in the letter.

57:59.146 --> 58:03.233
He doesn't want Felipe
to suck the color out of everything.

58:03.817 --> 58:07.279
He doesn't want us
to close the shutters any more.

58:07.529 --> 58:11.909
And he wants all of us
to take care of his Savino.

59:28.636 --> 59:32.940
I didn't know where you were.

59:35.810 --> 59:39.647
Adrianna, do you hate me?

59:39.680 --> 59:44.018
- Do you all hate me?
- What's the matter with you?

59:44.051 --> 59:49.056
Do you know how many years
it's been since Orian died?

59:49.090 --> 59:52.059
He's gone, but Savino is here.

59:52.093 --> 59:53.994
It had nothing to do with Orian.

59:54.028 --> 59:55.196
- No?
- No.

59:55.229 --> 59:58.933
Then why should I make any
more excuses for you, Felipe?

59:58.966 --> 1:00:00.835
You can't put my son in a prison

1:00:00.868 --> 1:00:06.373
because he looks like
another boy you lost.

1:00:06.407 --> 1:00:07.908
Look at me.

1:00:07.942 --> 1:00:10.711
Look at me.

1:00:10.744 --> 1:00:13.781
Your precious brother
died years ago,

1:00:13.814 --> 1:00:15.850
and none of us have
ever been allowed to get out

1:00:15.883 --> 1:00:18.786
from under your misery.

1:00:18.819 --> 1:00:20.321
Well, you won't crush my son
with it.

1:00:20.354 --> 1:00:21.822
Do you hear me?

1:00:21.856 --> 1:00:26.727
My Savvy is going to laugh
and be happy and live.

1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:29.330
Like his grandfather.

1:00:29.363 --> 1:00:31.899
And you can sit here
on your own in the dark.

1:00:31.932 --> 1:00:33.434
I've had enough.

1:00:33.467 --> 1:00:35.436
Do you hear me?

1:00:35.469 --> 1:00:38.439
I said do you fucking hear me?

1:00:38.472 --> 1:00:41.742
Ugh!

1:00:56.490 --> 1:00:57.925
Savvy?

1:00:57.958 --> 1:00:59.026
Where are you going?

1:00:59.059 --> 1:01:00.995
I'm going back.

1:01:01.028 --> 1:01:02.396
Savino, you can't go back.

1:01:02.429 --> 1:01:05.833
It's dangerous for you.

1:01:05.866 --> 1:01:10.371
You are 12 years old.

1:01:10.404 --> 1:01:11.805
I didn't know about
your grandfather.

1:01:11.839 --> 1:01:15.809
I didn't know he was sick.

1:01:15.843 --> 1:01:17.745
I didn't hate him.

1:01:17.778 --> 1:01:20.748
I promise.

1:01:20.781 --> 1:01:21.916
I'm just trying to protect you.

1:01:21.949 --> 1:01:23.784
Do you understand?

1:01:23.817 --> 1:01:25.386
I'm your father.
Please, come on.

1:01:25.419 --> 1:01:26.921
Stay here, please.

1:01:26.954 --> 1:01:28.756
Savino. Savino.

1:01:28.789 --> 1:01:30.758
Stay here. Savino, you can't go.

1:01:30.791 --> 1:01:31.492
Savino, you can't go!

1:01:31.526 --> 1:01:33.994
I'm telling you!

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:35.129
What are you gonna do, hit me?

1:01:37.998 --> 1:01:42.002
I hate you.

1:02:18.172 --> 1:02:20.174
I'm going back to the rock.

1:02:20.207 --> 1:02:22.943
I bet your dad's
foaming at the mouth.

1:02:22.977 --> 1:02:25.479
I don't give a shit about him.

1:02:25.513 --> 1:02:28.516
Well, at least
he came looking for you.

1:02:28.550 --> 1:02:30.150
Yeah.

1:02:30.184 --> 1:02:33.821
You want me to come?

1:02:33.854 --> 1:02:34.855
Hm.

1:02:34.888 --> 1:02:36.490
Come on.

1:02:36.524 --> 1:02:39.827
I'm ready.

1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:42.796
You gotta be joking.

1:02:42.830 --> 1:02:44.465
For fuck's sake.

1:02:49.903 --> 1:02:53.474
Take care of yourself.

1:02:55.276 --> 1:02:57.177
Oh, yeah.

1:02:57.211 --> 1:03:00.214
Did you ever get round
to texting your dad?

1:03:00.247 --> 1:03:01.882
You gotta tell him something.

1:03:01.915 --> 1:03:03.417
Anything.

1:03:03.450 --> 1:03:05.819
Anything that you want him to
know.

1:03:05.853 --> 1:03:10.525
Right from here.

1:03:10.558 --> 1:03:13.561
Just in case
you don't make it back,

1:03:13.595 --> 1:03:15.829
can I have that telescope?

1:03:15.863 --> 1:03:18.265
Not a chance in a billion years.

1:08:11.893 --> 1:08:15.128
Youth is as beautiful
and as fleeting

1:08:15.162 --> 1:08:16.430
as a shooting star

1:08:16.463 --> 1:08:20.233
in a clear night sky.

1:08:23.838 --> 1:08:27.174
But wisdom
is the Southern Cross,

1:08:27.207 --> 1:08:29.877
fixed and infinite,

1:08:29.911 --> 1:08:33.146
a guide for eternity.

1:11:13.406 --> 1:11:17.678
I'm not coming home with you.

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:25.086
Oi, did you hear what I said?

1:11:25.119 --> 1:11:28.355
I'm not coming home.

1:11:57.118 --> 1:12:00.453
It's impossible
to make a fire up here.

1:12:00.487 --> 1:12:05.660
It's too windy.

1:12:23.811 --> 1:12:27.748
I don't get you.

1:12:34.689 --> 1:12:37.158
Who's Orian?

1:12:53.473 --> 1:12:54.842
Here it is.

1:12:54.876 --> 1:12:58.045
It's part of your family.

1:13:04.451 --> 1:13:06.453
My dad's parents.

1:13:06.486 --> 1:13:10.157
I never even met them.

1:13:10.191 --> 1:13:16.564
I only knew my mom's side,
and my pops meant so much to me.

1:13:19.634 --> 1:13:23.470
Orian.

1:13:23.503 --> 1:13:28.209
He's just a little kid.

1:13:28.242 --> 1:13:32.213
Six.

1:13:32.246 --> 1:13:35.650
51.

1:13:35.683 --> 1:13:39.754
42.

1:13:39.787 --> 1:13:41.222
70.

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:44.191
What are you doing?

1:13:44.225 --> 1:13:46.160
I look at the dash
in between the two dates

1:13:46.193 --> 1:13:49.230
and I calculate
how long each person lived for.

1:13:49.263 --> 1:13:51.799
Oh.

1:13:51.832 --> 1:13:53.634
Isn't that what everyone does
at cemeteries?

1:13:53.668 --> 1:13:55.502
I don't know.

1:13:55.536 --> 1:13:58.205
Do they?

1:13:58.239 --> 1:14:03.577
Well, I just feel sorry for
the ones who have a short life.

1:14:03.611 --> 1:14:05.613
Do not just think
of a dash as merely

1:14:05.646 --> 1:14:08.249
a distance between two dates.

1:14:08.282 --> 1:14:12.253
A dash itself represents a life.

1:14:12.286 --> 1:14:16.489
But wouldn't a longer one
be better than a shorter one?

1:14:16.524 --> 1:14:21.529
Look, some people die at 20
but are buried at 80.

1:14:21.562 --> 1:14:25.498
I mean, you can live 100 years,

1:14:25.533 --> 1:14:31.238
but if it's a wasted life,
then for what?

1:14:35.943 --> 1:14:40.781
Orian...

1:14:40.815 --> 1:14:42.516
How do you know?

1:14:42.550 --> 1:14:48.656
I found these drawings
in Tio Goyo's bedroom.

1:14:48.689 --> 1:14:51.525
Orian was my little brother.

1:14:51.559 --> 1:14:54.695
Your uncle.

1:14:54.729 --> 1:14:57.598
What happened?

1:15:02.236 --> 1:15:06.240
I don't have friends here,
Savino.

1:15:06.273 --> 1:15:08.542
I don't have...

1:15:18.986 --> 1:15:20.855
Orian!

1:15:25.626 --> 1:15:26.894
Orian!

1:15:26.927 --> 1:15:29.964
We were in a cart rolling down.

1:15:29.997 --> 1:15:32.767
He was chasing us.

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:36.337
And...

1:15:36.370 --> 1:15:40.007
I heard some sound,
the car braking.

1:15:48.716 --> 1:15:52.319
I was supposed
to look after him.

1:15:52.353 --> 1:15:54.588
Can you understand me?

1:15:54.622 --> 1:15:58.292
And I didn't.

1:15:58.325 --> 1:16:00.628
It was an accident.

1:16:05.833 --> 1:16:08.669
I'm sorry, Savino.

1:16:08.702 --> 1:16:11.672
I... I can't...

1:16:11.705 --> 1:16:13.674
I can't live with it.

1:16:13.707 --> 1:16:15.609
I have something here.

1:16:25.753 --> 1:16:27.888
It's not your fault.

1:16:27.922 --> 1:16:31.659
It's not your fault.

1:16:31.692 --> 1:16:38.365
I promised Savino he would see
wonders on that rock.

1:16:38.399 --> 1:16:42.069
And he did.

1:16:42.103 --> 1:16:46.307
Savvy...

1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:48.976
I'm sorry.

1:16:49.009 --> 1:16:51.312
Don't be sorry.

1:16:51.345 --> 1:16:54.315
It's okay.

1:17:18.472 --> 1:17:19.907
We're still here.

1:17:37.491 --> 1:17:42.463
Please, think of this place
as your second home.

1:17:42.496 --> 1:17:46.767
And us as your second family.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:49.970
I will.

1:17:50.004 --> 1:17:55.476
I hope you and this bottle
arrive safely to Australia.

1:17:58.746 --> 1:18:00.881
Savino...

1:18:00.915 --> 1:18:04.385
Your father was a brave man.

1:18:04.418 --> 1:18:06.453
To take his family
to another country

1:18:06.487 --> 1:18:10.391
and start again.

1:18:10.424 --> 1:18:13.827
It takes time
to understand your parents.

1:18:13.861 --> 1:18:17.498
You will learn it with age.

1:18:17.532 --> 1:18:19.066
Thank you.

1:18:19.099 --> 1:18:20.734
Thank you for everything.

1:18:30.211 --> 1:18:31.979
Thank you.

1:18:33.548 --> 1:18:37.952
It is not loss we fear the most.

1:18:37.985 --> 1:18:43.757
Our greatest fear is to look up
at the stars and to dream.

1:18:43.791 --> 1:18:49.964
And to take the risk to make the
dash of our lifetime meaningful.

1:18:52.866 --> 1:18:55.537
At some stage in our life,

1:18:55.570 --> 1:18:58.839
each of our journeys
will change.

1:18:58.872 --> 1:19:04.445
We will be tested in ways
we could never imagine.

1:19:04.478 --> 1:19:07.014
And this is when
we might find ourselves

1:19:07.047 --> 1:19:11.819
looking through the wrong end
of the telescope.

1:19:11.852 --> 1:19:14.054
Unable to see the stars.

1:19:14.088 --> 1:19:18.826
Unable to find the right words
to say to your child,

1:19:18.859 --> 1:19:22.196
"It's not because of you."

1:19:24.599 --> 1:19:26.800
That summer on the rock,

1:19:26.834 --> 1:19:31.872
Felipe gave the greatest gift
a father could give.

1:19:31.905 --> 1:19:33.541
His honesty.

1:19:33.575 --> 1:19:39.113
The truth in his heart.

1:19:39.146 --> 1:19:43.484
We are tied on
this journey together.

1:19:43.518 --> 1:19:48.155
We must teach our children
and be taught by them.

1:19:48.188 --> 1:19:51.125
For once we trust in them,

1:19:51.158 --> 1:19:54.962
we will learn they are not us.

1:19:54.995 --> 1:19:58.899
They are themselves completely.
