male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.609 --> 00:11.779
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.148
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.182 --> 00:16.417
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.450 --> 00:17.685
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.718 --> 00:19.820
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.189
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.458
- OH, PLEASE,
DON'T HURT ME!

00:24.492 --> 00:26.260
DON'T HURT ME,
DON'T HURT ME, PLEASE!

00:26.294 --> 00:27.461
LET ME GO!
- STAY DOWN, BITCH!

00:27.495 --> 00:29.363
[woman sobbing]

00:29.397 --> 00:31.399
- HOLY CRAP.
- IS HE GONNA RAPE HER?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.501
- NO! DON'T HURT ME!
- GOT TO BE A JOKE.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.304
- HELP ME! PLEASE!
- YOU GUYS WATCHING THIS?

00:36.337 --> 00:39.073
- HELL, YEAH.
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.142
- I JUST LOGGED ON,
AND THERE IT WAS.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.543
- THIS IS SICK.
I CAN'T WATCH.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.412
- I BET EVERYONE ON CAMPUS
IS WATCHING.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.679
- [sobbing]

00:45.713 --> 00:47.215
- [gasps]
- OH!

00:47.248 --> 00:49.717
- OH, MY GOD!
- WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.719
- HELP ME! HELP ME!
- SOMEONE MUST HAVE CALLED

00:51.752 --> 00:53.487
THE COPS, RIGHT?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.189
- I'M BEGGING YOU!

00:55.223 --> 00:56.624
[sobbing]

00:59.127 --> 01:01.762
- FREEZE IT.
- NOPE.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.232
NOT ONE CALL TILL AFTER
THE DAMN VIDEO ENDED.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.300
- CAN YOU PLAY IT
FROM THE BEGINNING?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.436
- YOUR I.T. PEOPLE
KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.371
- WELL, THEY SAY IT WAS ROUTED
THROUGH ONE OF THEIR SERVERS

01:10.404 --> 01:11.839
OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY'S
INTRANET.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.341
- SO IT WAS ONLY PLAYED
ON CAMPUS.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.775
- AS FAR AS THEY CAN TELL.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.311
BUT STILL NO IDEA
WHERE THE FEED ORIGINATED.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.414
- CINDER BLOCK WALLS.
COULD IT BE AN EMPTY DORM ROOM?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.416
- YEAH, NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.685
- HOW MANY OF THOSE ON CAMPUS?
- THE RESIDENCE HALLS ARE FULL,

01:24.718 --> 01:26.287
EXCEPT FOR PEMBROKE.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.389
IT'S CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS
THIS SEMESTER.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.098
- THIS IS IT!

01:39.800 --> 01:42.836
- PERP AND VICTIM LONG GONE.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.839
- BUT HE LEFT US A MESSAGE.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.875
- "SEE NO EVIL."

02:43.264 --> 02:44.565
- ARE YOU SURE
THERE'S NO PRINTS?

02:44.598 --> 02:45.899
THE VIDEO SHOWS THE GIRL
AND THE RAPIST

02:45.933 --> 02:47.801
GRABBING THE BED FRAME.
- PERP WIPED IT CLEAN.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.638
- NO HAIR, FLUID, FIBERS?
- NOT EVEN DUST.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.573
HE MUST HAVE VACUUMED
AND SANITIZED THE PLACE.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.442
I CAN STILL SMELL
THE BLEACH.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.876
- IT'S BEEN LESS THAN AN HOUR

02:55.909 --> 02:58.646
SINCE HALF THAT CAMPUS
WATCHED HIM ATTACK HER.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.615
THIS BASTARD IS QUICK.
- OR IT WASN'T A LIVE SHOW.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.751
- YOU THINK HE RECORDED IT
HERE EARLIER

03:03.784 --> 03:04.985
AND PLAYED IT BACK
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE?

03:05.018 --> 03:08.422
- ALL HE NEEDED WAS INTERNET
ACCESS, BASIC HACKING SKILLS.

03:08.456 --> 03:11.592
- OLIVIA, COPS IN CLEVELAND
JUST PICKED UP NIGEL CLEMENS.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
YOU BETTER GO PACK.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.995
- CAPTAIN, I CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.897
- HARDWICKE HAS
THE EXTRADITION ORDER.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.433
MUNCH HAS THE TICKETS.
YOU ARE ON THE NEXT PLANE OUT.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.969
- GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
- RIGHT.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.672
SO HE OBVIOUSLY
WANTED US TO FIND THAT,

03:24.705 --> 03:25.939
THE ARROGANT PRICK.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.576
- SO ARROGANT, HE PARADED HER
IN FRONT OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS

03:28.609 --> 03:29.910
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.979
- HE HAD ONE HAND ON HER ARM,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.347
PROBABLY HELD HIS BLADE
TO HER BACK.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.483
- GOTTA BE MILES AWAY.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.751
- UNLESS HE STASHED HER
SOMEWHERE ON CAMPUS.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.953
- I'LL GET PATROL TO START
CHECKING THE BUILDINGS.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.523
YOU TWO GET SCREEN GRABS
FROM THE VIDEO.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.325
TRACK DOWN EVERY STUDENT
WHO SAW IT

03:44.358 --> 03:47.461
AND SEE IF ANYBODY
RECOGNIZES OUR VICTIM.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.862
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.931
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S NOT A STUDENT HERE.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.900
- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY
ON CAMPUS?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.034
- IT'S A SMALL SCHOOL,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.837
AND I DO MY WORK-STUDY
IN THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE, SO...

03:56.870 --> 03:58.539
- BUT STILL,
YOU SAW THIS GOING DOWN,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.408
AND YOU DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.043
- I GUESS I FIGURED
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.046
- EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS BEING RAPED.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.981
- PRETTY LAME EXCUSE, RIGHT?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.483
- AND WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

04:09.517 --> 04:11.685
- I HAVE A HUGE MIDTERM
THIS AFTERNOON, OKAY?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.388
19TH-CENTURY ENGLISH LIT.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.924
- WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.062
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
LOOK FAMILIAR?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.797
- HE'S WEARING A MASK.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.868
- I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE TATTOO.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.738
- YEAH, SURE.
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.039
- WHERE?
- AROUND CAMPUS.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.408
COUPLE GUYS HAVE 'EM.
- MM-HMM.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.744
ANY IDEA WHAT IT MEANS?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.879
- I WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO ASK ONCE.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.448
ASS-CLOWN TOLD ME TO PISS OFF

04:40.481 --> 04:43.884
LIKE IT WAS SOME KIND OF
ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.454
I CAN'T BELIEVE A STUDENT
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.389
- IT WASN'T NECESSARILY
A STUDENT.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.923
HACKER DIDN'T USE
ANY OF THE TERMINALS

04:49.957 --> 04:50.924
ON THE UNIVERSITY'S INTRANET.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.361
HE BROKE INTO THEIR SYSTEM
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.629
- ANY WAY TO TRACE IT?
- I TRIED, BUT HE'S A PRO.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.964
MADE HIMSELF
A SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
AND SET IT UP
SO THE I.P. ADDRESS SCRAMBLED

04:58.899 --> 05:00.868
THE MOMENT THE FEED STOPPED.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.437
REAL BLACK-HAT STUFF.
- ANYONE SEE IT OFF-CAMPUS?

05:03.471 --> 05:06.340
- ONLY IF THEY WERE ACCESSING
THE UNIVERSITY'S Wi-Fi.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.908
- WELL, THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T
GET ANY 911 CALLS

05:07.941 --> 05:09.477
FROM OFF-CAMPUS.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.978
- SO OUR RAPIST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

05:11.011 --> 05:13.714
HIS CRIME WAS ONLY SEEN
AT THE UNIVERSITY--WHY?

05:13.747 --> 05:14.948
- TO CREATE A SPECTACLE.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.550
HE'S RAPING HER
TO GET ATTENTION.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.085
- OKAY, IS THERE ANY WAY
TO NARROW DOWN

05:18.118 --> 05:19.620
HIS INTENDED AUDIENCE?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.622
- HE MIGHT BE DOING IT
TO IMPRESS HIS FRIENDS

05:21.655 --> 05:23.857
OR SCARE AN OLD GIRLFRIEND
OR JUST TO CREATE MASS TERROR

05:23.891 --> 05:25.826
BECAUSE HE HAS A BONE
TO PICK WITH THE SCHOOL.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.596
- DOC, CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT THE TATTOO MEANS?

05:28.629 --> 05:31.832
- I THINK THEY WERE GOING FOR
"TRY OR DIE."

05:31.865 --> 05:33.401
- GOING FOR?

05:33.434 --> 05:34.802
- ACTUALLY,
IT READS "PIE OR DIE."

05:34.835 --> 05:36.404
THE TATTOO ARTIST
WAS HAVING SOME FUN.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.672
- OR HE FLUNKED
CHINESE SPELLING 101.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.140
THE KID I TALKED TO
SAID HE'S SEEN IT

05:40.173 --> 05:42.075
ON MORE THAN ONE MALE STUDENT.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.744
- WELL, IT'S NOT
IN THE GANG DATABASE.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.746
I RAN A "BADS" SEARCH
ON A SPECIFIC IMAGE.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.415
HIT THE JACKPOT.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.517
THERE WAS ONE MATCH
WITH THAT TATTOO--

05:49.550 --> 05:50.784
CARL COOPER, AGE 22,

05:50.818 --> 05:54.622
JUNIOR AT WESTMORE UNIVERSITY
TILL HE WAS EXPELLED LAST YEAR.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.990
- FOR WHAT?
- THEY DIDN'T SAY.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.760
BUT HE GOT COLLARED THE NEXT DAY
FOR SEXUAL ABUSE THREE.

05:59.793 --> 06:03.997
HE LIVES A COUPLE OF BLOCKS
FROM WESTMORE UNIVERSITY.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.499
- CARL COOPER.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.635
YOU GOT A SECOND?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.838
- IT'S TOO COLD FOR THIS!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.811
- CARL, WHERE YOU GOING--
BACK TO SCHOOL?

06:17.845 --> 06:20.113
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- RIGHT.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.649
CHECK HIS APARTMENT.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.617
- AFTER I WALK BACK.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.118
- THERE'S NOTHING
IN MY APARTMENT.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.787
- REALLY?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.189
EXCEPT MAYBE MORE OF THESE?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.692
- IT'S ADDERALL.
I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.727
- YEAH, I BET YOU DO.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.496
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.631
- EASY, RIGHT?
YOU JUST TEXT SOME SHRINK,

06:37.665 --> 06:38.832
AND YOU TELL HIM
YOU HAVE A.D.D.,

06:38.866 --> 06:41.835
AND THEN HE WRITES YOU OUT
A SCRIPT, NO QUESTIONS ASKED?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.103
- IT'S LEGIT.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.705
I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE ENOUGH
TO STUDY.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.974
- OH, OKAY.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.976
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.177
- TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.446
I KISSED A CHICK
AT A SPRING FLING.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.847
- YOU KISSED HER?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.116
SHE SAYS THAT YOU JAMMED
YOUR HANDS DOWN HER PANTS.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.051
- DUDE, SHE WANTED THAT
AND MORE

06:58.085 --> 07:00.187
UNTIL HER BOYFRIEND FOUND OUT
I WAS MACKING HER,

07:00.220 --> 07:02.456
AND THE BITCH CRIED FOUL.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.057
- THE UNIVERSITY
BOOTED YOU OUT OF THERE, HUH?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.626
IT WAS PAYBACK TIME?
AM I CLOSE?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.461
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:07.495 --> 07:09.797
- CARL...

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
WHERE IS SHE?
- MORE LIKE WHO IS SHE?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.767
- WASN'T ENOUGH
JUST TO RAPE HER?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.603
YOU HAD TO BROADCAST IT
TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS?

07:15.636 --> 07:16.970
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.474
- I'M STILL CRAZY?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.809
AND YOU'RE BUSTED.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.043
- I WAS IN A FRATERNITY.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.813
THIS TATTOO
WAS PART OF THE INITIATION.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.648
IT MEANS "TRY OR DIE."

07:27.681 --> 07:30.651
- DID INITIATION INCLUDE RAPE
AND KIDNAPPING?

07:30.684 --> 07:33.787
- DOZENS OF GUYS IN THE FRAT
HAVE THE SAME INK.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.923
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THAT DUMP
OF A UNIVERSITY

07:35.956 --> 07:38.125
SINCE THEY KICKED ME OUT.

07:38.158 --> 07:42.129
I DIDN'T RAPE
OR KIDNAP ANYONE.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.799
- I TOSSED COOPER'S APARTMENT
AND THE WHOLE BUILDING--

07:45.833 --> 07:46.967
NO SIGN OF THE GIRL.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.636
- WELL, MAYBE ONE OF HIS
PHI DELTA BROTHERS

07:48.669 --> 07:51.104
IS HIDING HER.
- THEY ALL GOT THE SAME TAT.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.273
WE NEED A SEARCH WARRANT
FOR THE FRAT HOUSE.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.143
- THE TATTOO ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A WARRANT.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.745
AND YOUR PERP
WAS WEARING A MASK,

07:57.778 --> 07:59.246
SO A POSITIVE I.D.
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.848
GIVE ME A NAME.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.750
- BY THE TIME WE GET THAT,
SHE MAY BE DEAD.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.284
- I DON'T MAKE
THE LAWS, ELLIOT.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.786
- CAN WE HOLD HIM
ON THE ADDERALL?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.287
- HE HAS A LEGALLY OBTAINED
PRESCRIPTION,

08:07.320 --> 08:09.189
AND YOU DIDN'T CATCH HIM
IN THE ACT OF SELLING IT.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.224
- WE FOUND 'EM PACKAGED
IN BAGGIES FOR SALE.

08:11.258 --> 08:15.563
- I'LL SEE IF IT HOLDS UP
AT ARRAIGNMENT.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.631
- YOU THINK
CARL'S PHI DELTA BROTHERS

08:17.665 --> 08:19.299
WOULD BE ANY HELP?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.935
- WOULDN'T HURT TO ASK.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.105
- CARL COOPER'S A DOUCHE.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.274
WE BOOTED HIM RIGHT BEFORE
THE UNIVERSITY DID.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.876
- COULDN'T KEEP HIS HANDS
OFF THE LADIES?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.110
- YEAH. IT GOT SO BAD,

08:30.143 --> 08:31.679
WE STARTED CALLING IT
"COOPING A FEEL."

08:31.712 --> 08:33.280
I MEAN, WE GOT
A CODE OF CONDUCT HERE.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.248
- YEAH. YOU CONDUCT
YOURSELVES LIKE IDIOTS.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.785
THIS PLACE REEKS OF BEER
AND BONG HITS.

08:37.818 --> 08:41.755
- WELL, THERE'S NO UNDERAGE
DRINKING OR DRUGS IN THE HOUSE.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.924
- WELL, NOT SINCE YOU KICKED
CARL TO THE CURB, ANYWAY.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.959
- WHAT?
OH, YOU MEAN THE ADDERALL?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.327
IT'S THE NEW CAFFEINE.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.329
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU PULLED
AN ALL-NIGHTER, BRAH?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.264
- LAST NIGHT, BRAH.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.602
- LOOK, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

08:54.635 --> 08:58.606
- THIS GUY WITH YOUR
RITE-OF-PASSAGE INK ON HIS ARM.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.874
- YEAH. I CAN'T TELL
WHO THAT IS JUST FROM HIS ARM.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.975
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

09:02.009 --> 09:05.178
YOUR BROTHERS EVER BRING HER BY
TO MEET THE FAMILY?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.114
- WHOA.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.852
- SO SHE WAS HERE.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.322
- YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.157
- POSING WITH YOU.
- JUST FOR THE PHOTO.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.258
NO ONE INVITED HER
TO THE PARTY.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.160
SHE JUST WALKED
IN THE FRONT DOOR.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.295
- GET A NAME?
- LIZZIE HARMON.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.331
SAID SHE GOES TO JUILLIARD.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.336
- NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.172
HE EITHER TALKED HIS WAY
IN HERE, OR SHE KNOWS HIM.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.342
- HE ATTACKS HER...
DRAGS HER OFF

09:35.375 --> 09:38.912
WHILE SHE TRIES
TO FIGHT HIM OFF.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.718
- KNOWING FULL WELL
WE'D BE HERE SOON ENOUGH.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.621
- "SEE NO EVIL,
HEAR NO EVIL."

09:47.655 --> 09:50.257
GUESS WE KNOW
WHAT COMES NEXT.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.360
- YEAH, BUT WHAT THE HELL
DOES IT MEAN?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.233
- A COUPLE NEIGHBORS

10:00.267 --> 10:02.335
THOUGHT THEY HEARD A SCUFFLE
IN LIZZIE'S APARTMENT

10:02.369 --> 10:04.371
TWO NIGHTS AGO AROUND 8:00--
NO ONE'S SEEN HER SINCE.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.840
- YEAH, AND NOBODY BOTHERED
CALLING 911.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.375
- SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.143
- BUT INSTEAD,
THEY CALL THE MEDIA.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.212
THAT'S ALL WE NEED
RIGHT NOW.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.413
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.282
- HAIRS, FIBERS,
FINGERPRINTS GALORE,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.184
BUT NO BLOOD OR ANYTHING
TO INDICATE

10:17.217 --> 10:19.019
THE VICTIM WAS HURT
IN THE APARTMENT.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.088
- OR WHERE THE PERP TOOK HER.
- I'LL PROCESS WHAT I GOT

10:21.121 --> 10:22.856
AND GET BACK TO YOU
WITH THE RESULTS.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.692
- ANYTHING
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.994
- I SHOWED LIZZIE'S PICTURE
AROUND TO THE STORES,

10:27.027 --> 10:28.228
RESTAURANTS, DOORMEN.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.129
THEY ALL KNOW HER BY NAME,

10:29.162 --> 10:31.131
BUT NOBODY SAW HER
GETTING DRAGGED OUT.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.300
- MAYBE THEIR CAMERAS
CAUGHT SOMETHING.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.135
- THERE'S OUR MAN IN THE MASK.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.904
A CAMERA
FROM THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR

10:36.937 --> 10:38.939
CAUGHT HIM GOING INTO
LIZZIE'S PLACE TWO NIGHTS AGO

10:38.972 --> 10:40.340
BEFORE 8:00.
- WELL, THAT'S RIGHT BEFORE

10:40.373 --> 10:43.010
THE NEIGHBORS SAID THEY HEARD
THE RUCKUS AT HER PLACE.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.845
WHEN DID THEY COME OUT?
- WELL, THERE'S THE PROBLEM.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.313
THEY NEVER DID.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.783
- IS THERE ANY WAY HE COULD
HAVE GOTTEN HER OUT UNSEEN?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.453
- SERVICE STAIRS...

10:53.486 --> 10:56.389
LEADS OUT TO THE BACK
SERVICE ENTRANCE.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.291
THERE ARE NO CAMERAS
BACK THERE.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.160
- CAN WE PUT CARL COOPER
UNDER THAT MASK?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.195
- NO, WE CAN'T.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.997
HE WAS BUSY GETTING HIGH
AT HOME WITH SOME BUDS

11:04.031 --> 11:05.465
WHEN LIZZIE WAS SNATCHED.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.101
LANDLORD CONFIRMED IT.
HE'S NOT OUR GUY.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.336
- THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRACK DOWN

11:09.369 --> 11:11.705
EVERY MEMBER OF PHI DELTA
PAST AND PRESENT

11:11.739 --> 11:13.273
WHO'S GOT THAT INK.
- I CALLED THE FRAT PRESIDENT.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.008
HE'S MAKING UP A LIST
RIGHT NOW.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.811
- PATROL JUST BROUGHT IN
LIZZIE'S MOTHER.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.213
- MRS. HARMON?

11:20.247 --> 11:23.784
I'M CAPTAIN CRAGEN,
AND THIS IS DETECTIVE STABLER.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
- ALL THIS
IS FOR MY LIZZIE?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.888
- WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO FIND HER.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.258
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU HEARD FROM LIZZIE?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.426
- TWO NIGHTS AGO.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.428
- SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
- NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.468
SHE PRACTICES SO MUCH.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.305
SHE'S STUDYING PIANO
AT JUILLIARD, AND--

11:46.373 --> 11:48.809
- WHAT IS IT, MRS. HARMON?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.311
- THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE.
- OKAY, SOMEONE SHE'S SEEING?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.380
- SHE SAID
THAT SHE HAD MET A BOY

11:53.413 --> 11:56.817
A WEEK AGO...

11:56.850 --> 11:58.986
BUT SHE WASN'T SO SURE
THAT SHE LIKED HIM.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.021
- DID SHE TELL YOU HIS NAME?
- NO.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.526
BUT SHE SAID
HE KEPT CALLING HER.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.197
COULD HE HAVE TAKEN
MY LITTLE GIRL?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.399
- I DUMPED LIZZIE'S CELL--

12:12.432 --> 12:14.935
DOZENS OF CALLS
TO THE SAME FIVE NUMBERS.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.970
- ALL OF THEM UNREGISTERED
DISPOSABLE CELL PHONES.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.105
- SO WE CAN'T TRACE 'EM.
- NOT THE CALLS,

12:18.138 --> 12:20.774
BUT WE TRACED THE NUMBERS
BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.475
THE PHONES WERE SHIPPED
TO A CHECK-CASHING PLACE

12:22.509 --> 12:24.011
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.313
STORE OWNER EMAILED US
SOME SURVEILLANCE PICS

12:26.346 --> 12:28.248
OF PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED
THOSE CELL PHONES

12:28.281 --> 12:30.851
IN THE LAST WEEK.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.152
- I KNOW HIM.
- FROM WHERE?

12:32.185 --> 12:33.486
- WESTMORE UNIVERSITY.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.923
HE'S ONE OF THE STUDENTS
I TALKED TO.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.058
ENGELS,
GREGORY ENGELS.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.793
- I'LL HAVE CAMPUS SECURITY
DETAIN HIM.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.261
- SHE'S BACK.
LIZZIE'S ONLINE.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
- RIGHT AFTER
WE I.D.-ED ENGELS?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.933
IS THIS GUY WATCHING US
OR SOMETHING?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.134
- FEED'S STREAMING LIVE.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.869
- CAN YOU RUN A TRACE?
- I'M ON IT.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.303
- HELP!

12:50.337 --> 12:52.405
HELP!

12:52.439 --> 12:55.208
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

12:55.242 --> 12:59.112
- CAMPUS COPS SAY GREG ENGELS
IS A JUNIOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.414
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM
SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.050
- WELL, HE JUST FLUNKED
THIS CLASS.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.118
HE DIDN'T EVEN PUT UP
A FIREWALL THIS TIME.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.055
- HELL'S KITCHEN--
FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.101
- THIS PLACE IS EMPTY.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.104
WHERE'S HE GOT LIZZIE?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.274
- MAYBE WE HIT
THE WRONG APARTMENT.

13:27.307 --> 13:31.044
- OR MAYBE GREG SET UP.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.347
"SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL,
SPEAK NO EVIL."

13:37.250 --> 13:39.319
- HOW IN THE HELL
IS HE DOING THIS?

13:40.553 --> 13:43.190
- EASY. ENGELS SET UP THE LAPTOP
AND BROKE INTO THE Wi-Fi NETWORK

13:43.223 --> 13:45.058
OF A LAW FIRM IN ONE
OF THE BUILDINGS NEXT DOOR.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.027
- THAT'S AS FAR
AS YOU COULD TRACE IT?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.096
- I CLONED AN I.P. NUMBER
FROM ONE OF THE LAW FIRM SERVERS

13:49.129 --> 13:50.130
ONTO THE LAPTOP.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.464
DIDN'T LEAVE ME
ANYWHERE TO GO.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.333
- SON OF A BITCH GETS OFF
ON MANIPULATING US,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.135
SENDING US
ON A WILD-GOOSE CHASE.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.603
- NOT EXACTLY.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.171
THAT BROWNSTONE
IS SIGNIFICANT TO HIM.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.940
IT'S WHERE ENGELS
AND HIS BROTHER LIVED

13:59.973 --> 14:01.108
WITH THEIR FOSTER PARENTS.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.310
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEIR REAL ONES?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.244
- THEY DIED BACK IN 2001

14:04.277 --> 14:06.279
WHEN THEIR PLANE
TO THE CARIBBEAN CRASHED.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.281
- MAYBE GREG'S BROTHER
KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.117
- WELL, I DOUBT IT,

14:10.150 --> 14:12.285
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE HE IS.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.121
JASON ENGELS WAS ABDUCTED

14:14.154 --> 14:17.057
OUTSIDE THAT ABANDONED
BROWNSTONE TWO YEARS LATER.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.592
- I REMEMBER THAT CASE.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.328
WENT COLD--
HE WAS NEVER RECOVERED.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.164
- AND THEN GREGORY
FINALLY SNAPPED.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.298
AND THERE'S YOUR MONKEY.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.634
- I-I GET THAT ENGELS
IS TRAUMATIZED.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.003
WHY KIDNAP THE INNOCENT GIRL?
- CONTROL.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.639
HIS PARENTS' DEATH
AND HIS BROTHER'S ABDUCTION

14:32.672 --> 14:33.706
TOOK IT FROM HIM,
[cell phone chimes]

14:33.740 --> 14:36.309
AND THIS IS HIS TWISTED WAY
OF GETTING IT BACK.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.311
- A-HOLE COULDN'T
GET A HOBBY?

14:38.345 --> 14:41.114
- CSU SAYS GREG ENGELS'
FINGERPRINTS

14:41.148 --> 14:43.250
ARE ALL OVER
LIZZIE HARMON'S APARTMENT.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.218
- GREAT. NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS FIND HIM.

14:45.252 --> 14:49.122
- HAVE PATROL INTERVIEW
ALL OF GREG ENGEL'S FRIENDS.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.992
SEE IF ANY HAVE SEEN HIM.
CHECK WHERE HE HANGS OUT.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.927
TALKS TO EACH
OF HIS PROFESSORS.

14:53.961 --> 14:57.297
I WANT TO KNOW
HIS DAILY ROUTINE.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.966
- BE CAREFUL WITH THIS KID.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.600
HE'S SMART AND HE'S OBSESSED,

15:00.633 --> 15:02.069
AND THAT MAKES HIM DANGEROUS.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.536
I CAN'T PREDICT
HOW HE'LL REACT

15:03.570 --> 15:06.439
IF WE BACK HIM INTO A CORNER.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.208
- FREAKS LIKE HIM
ALWAYS MAKE A MISTAKE.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.710
GOTTA BE SOME WAY
FOR US TO TRIP HIM UP,

15:10.743 --> 15:12.712
MAKE HIM THINK
WE'RE ON TO HIM.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.482
- IF HE CATCHES ON TO US,
HE COULD CARRY OUT HIS THREAT.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.583
[elevator buzzes]

16:39.599 --> 16:41.701
- GREGORY ENGELS!

16:41.734 --> 16:45.072
- I DON'T HAVE A WEAPON.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.207
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY DANGER.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.608
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.343
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.045
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.384
WHERE'S LIZZIE HARMON?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.589
- RIGHT HERE.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.159
- [whimpering]

17:06.193 --> 17:09.062
- SO YOU HAVE
AN ACCOMPLICE, HUH?

17:09.096 --> 17:11.498
- MY LITTLE MONKEY.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.202
IF HE DOESN'T GET A SIGNAL
FROM ME EVERY TWO MINUTES,

17:15.235 --> 17:17.504
HE'S GONNA KILL HER.

17:19.406 --> 17:23.176
- HOW DO I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T FILM THAT HOURS AGO?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.378
HOW DO I KNOW
SHE'S STILL ALIVE?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.382
[beep]

17:29.416 --> 17:31.251
- AAH!
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.586
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.608
I WANT YOU TO FIND
MY BROTHER.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.016
- YOU CRACK THAT LAPTOP YET?
- NO, STILL TRYING.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.787
THIS ENGELS KID KNOWS HOW TO
ENCRYPT FORWARD AND BACKWARDS.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.458
HOPEFULLY, THIS'LL WORK.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.759
[beeping]
DAMN IT!

18:12.792 --> 18:14.594
ANOTHER MINEFIELD.
- WELL, GET THROUGH IT.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.596
I NEED TO KNOW WHY THIS GUY
WENT AFTER LIZZIE.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.797
DOES HE HATE HER?
IS IT MONEY?

18:17.830 --> 18:21.168
WHAT DOES THIS JOKER WANT?
- WHATEVER IT IS, I'LL FIND IT.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.636
- HEY, FIN.
WHERE'S ELLIOT?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.538
- I TURNED AROUND
A HALF HOUR AGO, HE WAS GONE.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.540
- AS IN LEFT THE BUILDING?

18:27.574 --> 18:29.442
- YOU GOT ME.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.780
- IT WENT STRAIGHT
TO VOICE MAIL.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.315
- WELL, HE'S EITHER
IN A DEAD ZONE,

18:35.348 --> 18:37.184
OUT OF JUICE,
OR HE TURNED IT OFF.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.520
- WHY THE HELL
WOULD HE DO THAT?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.855
- IT'S OFF, OKAY?
SATISFIED?

18:45.925 --> 18:47.727
- NOW THEY CAN'T TRACK
YOU HERE.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.696
- I STILL GOT MY GUN, PAL.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.698
- AND I STILL HAVE THE GIRL.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.799
- AAH!

18:52.832 --> 18:54.734
- IS THAT HOW YOU GET OFF--

18:54.767 --> 18:56.669
ABUSING DEFENSELESS WOMEN?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.871
- SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.840
- DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BALLS
TO DO IT YOURSELF.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.610
- I SAID SHUT UP!

19:05.845 --> 19:07.847
NOW READ IT.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.253
- YOU WENT TO AN AWFUL LOT
OF TROUBLE TO GET ME HERE.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.554
WHY?
- I DID MY HOMEWORK.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.756
SPECIAL VICTIMS HAS ONE

19:16.789 --> 19:19.592
OF THE N.Y.P.D.'S
HIGHEST CLEARANCE RATES.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.927
- SO IF YOU WANT HELP,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.264
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.403
WHAT'S ALL THIS CRAP
WITH THE MONKEYS?

19:30.437 --> 19:33.206
- TO FRUSTRATE YOU.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.609
GIVE YOU A TASTE OF WHAT I'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH FOR YEARS.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.781

19:58.598 --> 20:00.567
READ.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.270

20:11.911 --> 20:13.513

"FROM THE CORNER OF WEST 37TH

20:22.989 --> 20:26.493
- WHY I SENT YOU THERE.

KNOCKED MY BROTHER'S CASE

GETS LABELED A COLD CASE?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.878
NOT THIS TIME!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.987
- I WANT TO HELP YOU.
I CAN HELP YOU.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.789
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.526
NOW, FOR EVERY COP WHO IS
OUT THERE LOOKING FOR LIZZIE,

20:59.559 --> 21:00.993
THEY COULD BE SEARCHING
FOR YOUR BROTHER.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.730
- THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT JASON!

21:07.767 --> 21:09.669
BUT AS LONG
AS I'VE GOT LIZZIE...

21:11.738 --> 21:14.774
I'LL MAKE YOU CARE.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.777
- YOU LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE
FEEL PAIN?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.313
I CAN DO THAT TOO.

21:20.347 --> 21:24.751
- BREAK MY NECK.
BREAK MY NECK.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.653
[laughs]

21:26.686 --> 21:28.755
[coughs]

21:31.791 --> 21:34.026
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME...

21:34.060 --> 21:37.797
SHE'S DEAD BEFORE YOU STEP
INTO THAT ELEVATOR.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.632
- EL'S CAR IS GONE.
- YOU TRY KATHY?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.067
- SHE SAYS SHE HASN'T
SPOKEN TO HIM

21:41.100 --> 21:42.702
SINCE HE LEFT THE HOUSE
YESTERDAY.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.637
- ELLIOT JUST
DOESN'T WALK OUT ON A CASE.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.406
- UNLESS HE HAS
A DAMN GOOD REASON.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.808
- LIKE WHAT?
- THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM,

21:48.841 --> 21:51.711
HE WAS STARING AT HIS CELL PHONE
WITH A WEIRD LOOK ON HIS FACE.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.346
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CALL HIS PROVIDER,

21:53.380 --> 21:54.947
GET THEM TO COUGH UP
HIS TEXT LOGS.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.849
- FIN, I BROKE ENGELS' CODE

21:56.883 --> 21:59.452
AND FOUND A LOT OF STUFF
ON AN ABDUCTION,

21:59.486 --> 22:01.120
BUT NOT LIZZIE HARMON'S.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.656
- YOU MEAN
HIS KID BROTHER, JASON.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.692
- GREG WROTE EMAILS TO EVERY
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

22:05.725 --> 22:07.460
IN NEW YORK,
ASKING FOR FOLLOW-UPS,

22:07.494 --> 22:09.829
OFFERING TIPS,
BEGGING FOR HELP.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.599
- YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT,

22:12.632 --> 22:13.800
COVERED ALL THE BASES,

22:13.833 --> 22:16.669
CALLED EVERYONE
YOU COULD THINK OF.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.805
YOU'VE BEEN A ONE-MAN CRUSADE

22:18.838 --> 22:21.674
SINCE THE CASE WENT COLD.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.943
- I WROTE A MILLION LETTERS

22:23.976 --> 22:26.679
TO EVERY PRECINCT
I COULD FIND,

22:26.713 --> 22:28.481
EVEN HIRED A P.I.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.917
- AND?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.452
- FIRST PEOPLE WERE POLITE,

22:32.485 --> 22:35.054
THEN THEY STOPPED
PAYING ATTENTION,

22:35.087 --> 22:37.056
THEN, UH...

22:37.089 --> 22:39.125
THEN I BECAME A NUISANCE.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.761
- WELL, YOU NEVER GAVE UP.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.831
- AND I NEVER WILL.
WOULD YOU?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.673
- NO.
I'D DO THE SAME THING.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.676
- MY PARENTS ARE DEAD.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.745
JASON'S ALL I'VE GOT.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.116
- OKAY, SO THE DAY
HE WAS TAKEN,

23:04.150 --> 23:06.018
THE BOTH OF YOU WERE OUT
ON THE STREET ALONE?

23:06.052 --> 23:07.420
- YEAH.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.155
- WHERE WERE
YOUR FOSTER PARENTS?

23:09.188 --> 23:11.157
- GETTING HIGH OFF THE MONEY
THEY GOT

23:11.190 --> 23:13.826
FOR SUPPOSEDLY
TAKING CARE OF US.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.496
- ALL RIGHT.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.598
WHERE WERE YOU
AND JASON GOING?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.533
- A NEIGHBOR GAVE ME
A COUPLE BUCKS

23:20.567 --> 23:22.702
FOR TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE.
- MM-HMM.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.904
- THERE'S A BODEGA ON THE CORNER
THAT SOLD ITALIAN ICES.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.206
- MM-HMM.
- AND JASON LOVED CHERRY.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.175
- AND JASON WAS 3.
THAT MADE YOU...

23:29.208 --> 23:30.610
- 12.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.878
- [sighs]

23:31.911 --> 23:32.779
YOU TOLD DETECTIVE FIDDLER

23:32.812 --> 23:34.747
THAT YOU WERE KNOCKED DOWN
FROM BEHIND.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.115
BY THE TIME THAT YOU GOT UP,

23:36.148 --> 23:38.618
YOU SAW A CAR MOVING AWAY
FROM THE CURB.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.687
- I RAN AFTER IT, BUT IT
DIDN'T HAVE A LICENSE PLATE.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.821
- SO WHO WAS OUT
ON THE STREET?

23:41.854 --> 23:44.857
YOU HAVE MR. DAVIDSON.
- YEAH. HE WAS DOWN THE BLOCK.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.192
- DOWN THE BLOCK.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.628
- HE WAS WALKING APOLLO,
HIS GERMAN SHEPHERD.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.798
MRS. GANN WAS SWEEPING THE STEPS
BACK ON OUR BUILDING BEHIND US.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.933
- ANYONE ELSE YOU REMEMBER?
- THERE WAS A GUY--

23:53.966 --> 23:55.535
WEIRD-LOOKING, STRINGY HAIR.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.803
I THINK HE WAS SCORING POT

23:56.836 --> 23:58.037
OFF THE GUY
MY FOSTER PARENTS BOUGHT FROM.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.973
YEAH, HERE HE IS--
JACK DEL MAR.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.809
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON I SAW

24:02.842 --> 24:04.577
WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUPER
IN OUR BUILDING

24:04.611 --> 24:06.746
COMING HOME FROM SUMMER SCHOOL.
- MINDY SHERMAN.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.180
- YEAH.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.220
EVERY ONE OF THEM
SAW THE WHOLE THING...

24:17.089 --> 24:19.526
ME BEING KNOCKED DOWN...

24:21.060 --> 24:23.129
JASON THROWN INTO THE CAR.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.565
ME SCREAMING.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.799
- IT'S CALLED
THE BYSTANDER EFFECT.

24:26.833 --> 24:31.504
NOBODY DOES ANYTHING BECAUSE
THEY THINK SOMEONE ELSE WILL.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.841
- JASON MUST HAVE BEEN SCARED
TO DEATH.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.009
- JUST LIKE LIZZIE IS NOW.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.013
- WHAT?
- WELL, YOU'RE DOING TO HER

24:41.047 --> 24:42.849
WHAT THE KIDNAPPERS
DID TO YOUR BROTHER.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.851
- SHUT UP.
- LET HER GO.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.853
I SWEAR,
I'LL WORK JASON'S CASE,

24:46.886 --> 24:48.655
AND I WON'T STOP
UNTIL I FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.590
I PROMISE YOU.

24:50.623 --> 24:54.093
- I-I PROMISE YOU...

24:54.126 --> 24:56.829
SHE'S DEAD UNLESS YOU FIND
MY BROTHER FIRST.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.235
[softly]
SHE'S DEAD.

25:03.269 --> 25:07.139
[footsteps departing]

25:09.709 --> 25:11.778
- YOU FIND STABLER YET?
- NO, BUT HIS SERVICE PROVIDER

25:11.811 --> 25:13.680
SAID HE GOT A BUNCH OF TEXTS.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.014
- WE CAN TRACK
ELLIOT'S MOVEMENTS

25:15.047 --> 25:16.816
BY MATCHING THE TEXTS
TO HIS GPS.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.084
HE GOT THE FIRST THREE TEXTS

25:18.117 --> 25:19.852
WHEN HE WAS STILL
IN THE PRECINCT.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.722
- OKAY. THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT LURED ELLIOT OUT THE DOOR.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.090
- UH-HUH. ELLIOT WAS UPTOWN
WHEN HE GOT THE NEXT ONE.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.092
HE TURNED AND HEADED EAST.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.027
- SO ENGELS WAS GIVING HIM
DIRECTIONS ON THE FLY.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.696
WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE FROM?

25:29.729 --> 25:30.963
- MIDDLE OF 59TH STREET BRIDGE.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.132
THAT MUST BE WHERE HE SENT
EL THE ADDRESS,

25:33.165 --> 25:34.667
'CAUSE THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.269
- SO HE'S WITH ENGELS
SOMEWHERE IN QUEENS.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.338
AND WE'RE SCREWED.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.574
HIM AND US.
- MAYBE NOT.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.176
THIS NUMBER'S FOR THE BURN PHONE
THAT SENT ELLIOT THE TEXTS.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.212
WITH A LITTLE LUCK...

25:46.245 --> 25:47.947
WE CAN TRACE IT.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.050
- I CAN'T SEE THE ANSWER
IN HERE.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.188
- SO YOU'RE GIVING UP TOO,
HUH?

25:57.624 --> 25:59.058
- NO.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.697
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.035
ANYTHING YOU REMEMBER.

26:09.068 --> 26:15.041
- BROWN HAIR.
BLUE EYES.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.843
WE USED TO MAKE FORTS
WITH OUR BLANKETS

26:16.876 --> 26:20.046
AND PRETEND
WE WERE LIVING BACK HOME.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.381
HE ALWAYS CALLED ME GIG.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.084
- WHY GIG?

26:25.117 --> 26:27.086
- WHEN JASON WAS LITTLE,

26:27.119 --> 26:29.021
HE COULDN'T SAY GREG.

26:29.055 --> 26:33.159
SO INSTEAD HE SAID GIG.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.198
LAST THING I HEARD HIM YELL
AS THE CAR DROVE OFF.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.335
WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?

26:43.369 --> 26:46.105
- GREG...

26:46.138 --> 26:49.208
YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.012
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
JASON WAS KIDNAPPED.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.181
- YOU THINK I'M DOING THIS
'CAUSE I FEEL GUILTY?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.849
- WE ALL DO A LOT OF THINGS
OUT OF GUILT

26:56.883 --> 27:00.052
THAT CLOUD OUR JUDGMENT.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.420
- W-WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.155
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.091
- YOU LOST YOUR LITTLE BROTHER,

27:05.124 --> 27:08.160
THE ONLY PERSON
YOU LOVED IN THIS WORLD.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.161
I...

27:09.195 --> 27:10.362
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PAIN

27:10.396 --> 27:12.732
OR WHAT IT WOULD MAKE ME DO.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.166
- NO.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.968
YOU CAN'T.

27:16.002 --> 27:19.105
- I'M GUESSING
LIZZIE'S MOTHER CAN.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.208
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT
LIZZIE'S MOTHER.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.110
- WELL, SHE'S GOING THROUGH
THE EXACT SAME AGONY

27:24.143 --> 27:26.078
YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.213
NOW, YOU'VE GOTTEN
WHAT YOU WANT.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.216
YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION.
LET LIZZIE GO.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.386
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.989
SPARE HER AND HER MOTHER
YOUR PAIN.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.191
JUST TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.262
- YOU PROMISE YOU'LL WORK
JASON'S CASE?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.264
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.199
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.304
- OKAY.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.209
- OKAY?
[footsteps]

27:57.243 --> 28:00.146
- WHAT'S THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.448
- THEY TRACKED YOU HERE.
- I TURNED OFF MY PHONE.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.883
I GAVE IT TO YOU.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.085
DID YOU TURN YOURS OFF?

28:06.118 --> 28:07.286
- ELLIOT, YOU DOWN HERE?

28:07.319 --> 28:09.889
- CAPTAIN?

28:09.922 --> 28:12.191
I'M ALL RIGHT.
BACK OFF.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.896
WHERE'S LIZZIE?
- GO TO HELL.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.234
- DON'T SHOOT!
HE'S NOT ARMED.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.270
- YOU--HANDS UP.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.338
- SHE'S DEAD.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.977
YOU KILLED HER.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.959
- WHERE'S LIZZIE'S BODY?

28:46.993 --> 28:50.329
AT LEAST GIVE HER MOTHER
SOME PEACE.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.377
FIND ANYTHING?
- NO. WE SEARCHED THE BUILDING

29:05.411 --> 29:08.214
TOP TO BOTTOM...
NO LIZZIE,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.916
AND NO TELLING WHERE

29:09.949 --> 29:11.918
GREG'S SKI-MASK WEARING
PARTNER HAS HER.

29:11.951 --> 29:12.985
- ANY WAY TO TRACE
THE VIDEO FEED?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.520
- NO. IT WENT OFFLINE
WHEN HE SMASHED THE iPAD.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.855
- HE SAID THE MOMENT
THAT HE STOPPED

29:15.888 --> 29:17.023
COMMUNICATING WITH HIS PARTNER

29:17.056 --> 29:18.991
LIZZIE WOULD BE DEAD.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.559
- WE STILL GOTTA FIND HER.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.862
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT ROOM DOWNSTAIRS?

29:22.895 --> 29:25.865
- NOTHING THAT CAN HELP US.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.868
I WAS GETTING INTO
HIS HEAD, THOUGH.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.470
I MEAN...

29:31.503 --> 29:34.040
IS HE THAT SCREWED UP?

29:35.541 --> 29:39.912
IS HE THAT BEATEN DOWN THAT
HE WOULD TAKE LIZZIE'S LIFE?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.917
OFFICER, WAIT--YO.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.254
GIVE US A MINUTE, WILL YOU?

29:51.423 --> 29:53.559
MOVE OVER.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.840
SO WHY ARE YOU FROWNING?

30:07.874 --> 30:09.876
IT'S OVER.
YOU SMASHED YOUR iPAD.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.544
YOUR MONKEY MURDERED LIZZIE.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.546
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I LIKE HAVING TO DO THIS?

30:14.580 --> 30:18.517
- I THINK YOU HAD NO INTENTION
OF TELLING US WHERE LIZZIE IS.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.253
ALL YOU WANTED WAS REVENGE.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.590
- ON WHO?
- THE NYPD.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.192
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
LEADING US AROUND

30:26.225 --> 30:27.626
FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS
BY OUR NOSE.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.128
THAT'S WHY
YOU TORTURED THAT GIRL,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.629
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
FIND YOUR BROTHER.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.099
- [laughing] THAT'S A LIE.
- IS IT?

30:33.132 --> 30:36.969
- I JUST WANTED SOMEONE
TO PAY ATTENTION.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.271
[laughing]

30:39.305 --> 30:41.607
TO CARE ABOUT JASON.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.609
- WELL, YOU GOT A SICK WAY
OF SHOWING THAT.

30:43.642 --> 30:47.046
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH?

30:47.079 --> 30:49.882
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
ANYMORE.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.851
I DON'T CARE IF I LIVE
OR I DIE.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.356
- SO WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

31:05.932 --> 31:08.867
- I NEVER WANTED
TO KILL HER.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.871
- SHE'S STILL ALIVE,
ISN'T SHE?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.674
- [whispers]
YEAH.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.144
- [exhales}

31:18.177 --> 31:21.047
WHERE IS SHE?

31:30.990 --> 31:33.259
- FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY BROTHER.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.698
- ONLY THING COLDER
THAN THIS CASE

31:39.731 --> 31:41.433
IS YOU MAKING US
START FROM SCRATCH.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.370
- WHEN WE FIND JASON ENGELS,
WE FIND LIZZIE HARMON.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.239
- DOC, CAN YOU PULL AND PROFILE
ALL KNOWN SEX OFFENDERS

31:47.273 --> 31:49.408
LIVING IN JASON'S NEIGHBORHOOD
IN 2003?

31:49.441 --> 31:50.943
- ON IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.078
THE REST OF US WILL TRACK DOWN

31:52.111 --> 31:55.547
AND RE-INTERVIEW
THE ORIGINAL WITNESSES.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.985
- I WAS OUT WALKING MY DOG
APOLLO WHEN I HEARD A RUCKUS.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.988
I SAW THIS LITTLE KID
BEING DRAGGED INTO A CAR.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.623
I THOUGHT HE WAS
HAVING A TANTRUM.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.693
- MR. DAVIDSON, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE COLOR OF THE CAR?

32:07.726 --> 32:10.963
- UH...GREEN.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.664
IT WAS A STATION WAGON.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.333
- IT WAS A BEIGE SEDAN.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.136
- DID YOU SEE ANYBODY SKETCHY
NEARBY?

32:17.169 --> 32:21.073
- GUY WAS ACROSS THE STREET.
SEEN HM AROUND BEFORE.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.275
I THINK HE WAS
BUYING MARIJUANA.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.144
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

32:25.177 --> 32:27.379
- JACK DEL MAR.
- MR. DEL MAR,

32:27.413 --> 32:30.983
YOU RECALL BEING ON
WEST 37TH AND 10TH

32:31.017 --> 32:32.751
THE DAY JASON ENGELS
WAS ABDUCTED?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.620
- [British accent]
YEAH.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.688
I STAYED TO VISIT A PLAYER
ON MY SOCCER TEAM.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.125
- WE HEARD
YOU WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

32:39.158 --> 32:40.126
COPPING DRUGS.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.394
- [laughs]
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.530
THE BOY GOT A CONCUSSION
THE DAY BEFORE.

32:44.563 --> 32:48.467
- WHOA, WHOA...
Y-YOU COACHED SOCCER?

32:48.500 --> 32:51.370
- STILL DO.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

32:51.403 --> 32:53.239
I LOVE KIDS.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.574
- I SAW THE KID GET SHOVED
IN THE BACK OF A CAR.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.509
MY INSTINCTS TOLD ME
SOMETHING WAS OFF.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.078
- BUT YOU DIDN'T INTERVENE.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.579
- I THOUGHT SOMEONE ELSE WOULD.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.215
- MM-HMM. AND YOU'RE SURE
THAT IT WAS A MAN

33:03.249 --> 33:04.650
WHO SHOVED JASON
INTO THE CAR.

33:04.683 --> 33:08.087
- POSITIVE.
- ANYONE OR ANYTHING ELSE

33:08.120 --> 33:09.755
SEEM OFF TO YOU THAT DAY,
MS. SHERMAN?

33:09.788 --> 33:11.123
- NO.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.025
MRS. GANN WAS OUT
ON HER STOOP.

33:13.059 --> 33:17.096
I SAW...MR. DAVIDSON,
MRS. PENNER.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.730
OTHER THAN THAT BOY
GETTING GRABBED,

33:18.764 --> 33:20.466
IT WAS A NORMAL DAY.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.106
- CAPTAIN,
THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.241
- AND THEIR STORIES
STILL HOLD UP.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.809
- DEAD ON TO WHAT THEY TOLD
DETECTIVES

33:30.842 --> 33:33.045
AFTER JASON ENGELS
WAS KIDNAPPED.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.213
- WELCOME BACK.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.082
NIGEL CLEMENS
IS AT CENTRAL BOOKING?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.749
- HAND-DELIVERED.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.219
YOU TWO LOOK LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
SLEPT SINCE I LEFT.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.353
- PRETTY DAMN CLOSE.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.089
- SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND THE GIRL.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.324
- ONLY HER KIDNAPPER.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.826
AND HE JUST SENT US BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.528
- COPS BACK IN '03 BROUGHT IN

33:49.561 --> 33:51.497
EVERY REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER
IN MANHATTAN

33:51.530 --> 33:53.099
AND CAME UP EMPTY.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.501
- AND THREE DIFFERENT
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE KIDNAP CAR.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.137
GREEN, BEIGE,
AND MIDNIGHT BLUE

33:58.170 --> 34:00.172
SEDAN, STATION WAGON,
AND HATCHBACK.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.708
- SO THE ONLY THING
THAT OUR WITNESSES AGREE ON

34:02.741 --> 34:05.411
IS THAT JASON WAS SHOVED
INTO A CAR BY SOME GUY.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.513
- WHAT IF THE TAKER
WASN'T A GUY?

34:07.546 --> 34:10.116
- WHAT, YOUR GUT TELLING YOU
IT WAS A WOMAN?

34:10.149 --> 34:11.183
- NO, SOMETHING
MINDY SHERMAN SAID

34:11.217 --> 34:14.120
THAT SHE SAW A MRS. PENNER
OUT THERE THAT MORNING.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.088
NOW, THERE WAS NO MRS. PENNER

34:16.122 --> 34:18.390
IN THE ACCOUNT SHE GAVE COPS
BACK IN '03.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.858
- I HAVEN'T
COME ACROSS THAT NAME

34:19.891 --> 34:21.527
IN ANY OF THE REPORTS
I'VE SEEN.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.229
- AND NO MRS. PENNER
ON THE LIST OF WITNESSES

34:23.262 --> 34:25.197
BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.500
- I'M GONNA ASK GREG
IF HE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.603
- I USED TO BABYSIT
MRS. PENNER'S KID, DANNY.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.205
WHAT ABOUT HER?

34:33.239 --> 34:34.673
- HER NAME CAME UP
IN THE INVESTIGATION,

34:34.706 --> 34:36.708
BUT THE COPS NEVER
INTERVIEWED HER BACK IN '03.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.611
- BECAUSE SHE WASN'T THERE
THE DAY JASON WAS KIDNAPPED.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.547
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.815
- HER PARENTS LIVED
IN STATEN ISLAND.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.584
SHE WAS ALL BROKEN UP
AFTER DANNY DIED.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.586
SHE MOVED BACK IN WITH THEM.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.621
- DANNY PENNER DIED? HOW?
- LEUKEMIA.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.657
HE WAS ONLY THREE.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.129
I REMEMBER THE DAY MRS. PENNER
MOVED OFF OUR BLOCK.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.665
CRYING AND SCREAMING.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.834
SAYING ALL SHE WANTED
WAS HER LITTLE BOY BACK.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.706
HEY.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.841
- MIRIAM PENNER SPENT SIX WEEKS
IN BELLEVUE PSYCH WARD

35:09.875 --> 35:12.144
AFTER HER SON DIED
IN APRIL, '03.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.345
- AND HER DMV RECORDS SHOW

35:13.379 --> 35:15.647
SHE'S OWNED A GREEN '99
SUBARU WAGON

35:15.681 --> 35:18.484
SINCE BEFORE JASON ENGELS
DISAPPEARED.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.252
- A GREEN STATION WAGON.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.720
ONE OF THE WITNESSES
HAD IT RIGHT.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.355
- SHE LOSES HER SON.
SHE'S STEWING IN BELLEVUE.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.356
WHEN SHE GETS OUT,

35:24.390 --> 35:26.258
SHE DECIDES TO GO BACK
TO THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD

35:26.292 --> 35:27.193
AND REPLACE HIM WITH JASON.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.561
- HOW DOES SHE EXPLAIN HIM
TO HER PARENTS?

35:29.595 --> 35:31.163
- I CHECKED.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.731
PARENTS IN STATEN ISLAND
ARE A CROC.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.400
MIRIAM'S FOLKS
LIVE IN BOCA RATON.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.934
- OKAY, GREAT.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.837
CALLED MIRIAM'S NUMBER.
I SAID I WAS DOING A SURVEY,

35:38.870 --> 35:40.172
AND THE WOMAN
WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE

35:40.206 --> 35:41.173
SAID SHE WAS A BABYSITTER.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.808
I THINK IT WAS HER.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.510
- LOOK, IF SHE'S BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS,

35:44.543 --> 35:46.345
SHE MAY KNOW WE'RE ON TO HER.
- I'LL HAVE PATROL

35:46.378 --> 35:48.680
SIT ON HER HOUSE
IN CASE SHE TRIES TO BOLT.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.825
- HEY. MANHATTAN SVU.
WHICH ONE'S THE HOUSE?

35:59.858 --> 36:01.760
- TWO DOWN ON THE RIGHT.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.295
NOT A CREATURE IS STIRRING.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.931
- THERE IS NOW.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.200
[tires squealing]

36:08.234 --> 36:11.303
[sirens wailing]

36:11.337 --> 36:12.938
- MIRIAM PENNER!
POLICE!

36:12.971 --> 36:14.940
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

36:14.973 --> 36:18.244
PUT IT IN PARK.
GET OUT!

36:18.277 --> 36:20.312
GET OUT!

36:20.346 --> 36:22.314
GET OUT. GET OUT.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.383
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO TODAY,
MIRIAM?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.218
- TO VISIT MY MOTHER
IN FLORIDA.

36:26.252 --> 36:28.220
- REALLY? YOU GONNA STAY WITH
HER FOR REAL THIS TIME?

36:28.254 --> 36:30.889
MIRIAM? MIRIAM.
WHERE IS HE?

36:30.922 --> 36:32.424
WHERE'S JASON ENGELS?
- I DON'T SEE HIM!

36:32.458 --> 36:34.360
- JASON WHO?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.629
- FOUND HIM.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.864
- HE'S MY SON!
HE'S MY SON!

36:38.897 --> 36:40.266
YOU CAN'T TAKE DANNY!

36:40.299 --> 36:42.000
- JASON? JASON.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.636
JASON, WAKE UP, HONEY.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.438
- YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM!

36:46.472 --> 36:49.275
- HE'S BREATHING.
HE'S SEDATED.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.442
- PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T TAKE HIM.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.411
HE'S MY WHOLE LIFE!

36:52.444 --> 36:56.315
[sobbing]

36:57.616 --> 37:01.353
- MIRIAM PENNER, YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST FOR KIDNAPPING.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.989
- MY BABY!
MY BABY, GOD!

37:04.022 --> 37:07.893
DON'T TAKE AWAY MY BABY!
- I'LL RIDE WITH HIM.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.297

37:11.330 --> 37:12.798
MY BABY!

37:12.831 --> 37:16.368
DON'T TRY TAKE

37:17.603 --> 37:18.870
[buzzer]

37:20.339 --> 37:22.941

37:23.942 --> 37:25.043
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

37:25.076 --> 37:27.479
- WE'RE GONNA GO SEE LIZZIE.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.981
WE FOUND YOUR BROTHER.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.983
- YOU HAVE JASON?

37:32.017 --> 37:33.285
WHERE IS HE?

37:33.319 --> 37:35.287
- HE'S BEING CHECKED OUT
BY A DOCTOR,

37:35.321 --> 37:37.022
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP YOUR WORD.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.559
POLICE!
SHOW US YOUR HANDS!

37:40.592 --> 37:42.694
- DON'T SHOOT!
- LIZZIE HARMON, YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:42.728 --> 37:45.931
- YEAH.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.037
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.406
- HEY, BRAH,
YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.841
- SHUT UP, PHI DELT!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:55.874 --> 37:57.743
- HOPE THEY DIDN'T
FREAK YOU OUT.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.778
- WHO, ME OR THEM?

37:59.811 --> 38:04.950
ALL THREE OF YOU ARE IN A HELL
OF A LOT OF TROUBLE.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.518
- LIZZIE WASN'T RAPED.

38:06.552 --> 38:08.354
DOUG NEVER KIDNAPPED HER.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.055
NO HARM DONE.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.056
- YEAH? TELL THAT
TO LIZZIE'S MOM

38:11.089 --> 38:13.459
AND THE DOZENS OF COPS
YOU SENT THROUGH HELL.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.626
- GREG NEEDED OUR HELP.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.027
WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS

38:16.061 --> 38:18.364
IF YOU GUYS HAD FOUND GREG'S
BROTHER EIGHT YEARS AGO.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.366
CAN I CALL MY MOM?

38:20.399 --> 38:23.735
- YOU GONNA BUST US?
- THEY'RE GONNA BUST ME.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.705
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS.

38:26.738 --> 38:30.709
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

38:30.742 --> 38:34.846
JUST LET ME SEE MY BROTHER
BEFORE YOU TAKE ME IN.

38:36.682 --> 38:39.485
- TURN AROUND.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.358

OH...

JASON?

38:48.093 --> 38:51.029
[sniffling]

38:51.062 --> 38:53.131
JASON.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.334
JASON, IT'S ME.

39:09.615 --> 39:13.552
- GIG!
