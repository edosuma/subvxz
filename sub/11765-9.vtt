WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.573
SO WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF "INCEPTION"?

00:02.573 --> 00:04.605
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

00:04.605 --> 00:06.537
AND HERE WE GO.

00:06.537 --> 00:08.679
IF SOMEONE COULD
GO INTO YOUR DREAMS,

00:08.679 --> 00:11.242
THEN THEY SHOULD
DO SOMETHING NICE,

00:11.242 --> 00:13.144
LIKE MAKE ME STOP DREAMING

00:13.144 --> 00:15.516
OF HAVING SEX WITH THAT
NECK TATTOO GUY AT YOUR BAR.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.787
YOU DREAM ABOUT HIM?

00:16.787 --> 00:18.419
(chuckles) NO.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.492
CAN YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
IF "TITANIC" GUY

00:21.492 --> 00:23.254
WAS REALLY WITH HIS KIDS
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE,

00:23.254 --> 00:25.056
OR WAS HE STILL JUST DREAMING?

00:25.056 --> 00:27.528
I MEAN, DID THE TOP
STOP SPINNING OR NOT?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.230
THE MOVIE IS OPEN-ENDED.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.031
YOU GET TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.135
WE DON'T HIT
WHEN WE'RE FRUSTRATED.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.436
I DON'T LIKE
OPEN-ENDED MOVIES.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.737
THAT'S WHY
I NEVER LIKED "GREASE."

00:36.737 --> 00:38.669
HOW IS "GREASE" OPEN-ENDED?

00:38.669 --> 00:41.312
WHERE DO THEY GO
IN THE FLYING CAR, TRAVIS?

00:41.312 --> 00:43.514
I MEAN, DO THEY LIVE
IN SPACE NOW?

00:43.514 --> 00:48.219
YEP. THAT'S WHAT "GREASE 2"
WAS ABOUT--"GREASE" IN SPACE.

00:48.219 --> 00:50.651
в™Є "GREASE 2: GREASE IN SPACE" в™Є

00:50.651 --> 00:52.623
в™Є WE'RE DOING THE HAND JIVE
WITH THE ALIEN RACE в™Є

00:52.623 --> 00:55.326
в™Є BLAST AWAY, AWAY WITH ME в™Є

00:55.326 --> 00:57.828
в™Є WE'RE SUMMER LOVIN'
IN ANTIGRAVITY в™Є

00:57.828 --> 00:59.460
в™Є GREASE IN SPACE в™Є

00:59.460 --> 01:04.495
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:04.495 --> 01:06.567
OH!

01:06.567 --> 01:09.770
MAN, I KEEP GETTING
THIS SHARP PAIN IN MY STOMACH.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.402
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, RIGHT?

01:11.402 --> 01:13.073
(high-pitched voice)
CANCER!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.576
MY FRIEND NEZZIE HAD
STOMACH PAINS SHE IGNORED,

01:15.576 --> 01:18.209
AND THEN SHE HAD A BABY
IN CONTEMPO CASUALS.

01:18.209 --> 01:19.610
SHE DIDN'T KEEP THE KID,
BUT THEY DID MAKE HER

01:19.610 --> 01:21.852
BUY THE MINISKIRT
THAT SHE GOT PLACENTA ON.

01:21.852 --> 01:23.384
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
TELL THAT STORY

01:23.384 --> 01:25.556
WHEN YOU HOST
THE WHITE TRASH AWARDS.

01:25.556 --> 01:28.359
ANYWAY, ALREADY CALLED
THE WINDOW DOCTOR.

01:28.359 --> 01:31.162
MORNING. LET'S, UH, CHECK
YOUR TEMPERATURE.

01:31.162 --> 01:32.593
ALL RIGHT. MM.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.325
(mouth full)
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

01:34.325 --> 01:35.726
WE DON'T EVER HAVE TO CALL
A REAL DOCTOR ANYMORE.

01:35.726 --> 01:37.698
UH, I'M--I'M STILL
A REAL DOCTOR.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.770
(laughs) OKAY.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.402
YEAH.
(laughs)

01:41.402 --> 01:42.633
ELLIE, NOW THAT
LAURIE AND WADE LIVE TOGETHER,

01:42.633 --> 01:44.175
THERE'S A NEW COUPLE...

01:44.175 --> 01:45.506
FOR OUR DINNER ROTATION.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.239
I SAY ALL SIX OF US
GO OUT TONIGHT.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.381
OH, TONIGHT WOULD BE A PERFECT
NIGHT FOR ME NOT TO DO THAT.

01:50.381 --> 01:51.882
YEAH, I'LL PASS, TOO.

01:51.882 --> 01:53.414
YOU'RE BOTH GOING.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.617
TOM, MY HEART IS NOT
IN MY UNDER-BOOB.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.350
OH, SORRY. DO YOU HAVE
THAT URINE SAMPLE?

01:59.350 --> 02:01.322
OH. YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.594
YOU HAVE CLEAN URINE
IN YOUR FRIDGE?
(refrigerator door opens)

02:03.594 --> 02:05.626
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I APPLIED
FOR THAT JOB AT WALMART?
(refrigerator door closes)

02:05.626 --> 02:08.329
HMM. ONE OF THESE
IS CHICKEN BROTH.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.600
OH, WELL, TEST THEM BOTH.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.502
SWEET. THERE'S DINNER.

02:11.502 --> 02:12.803
(rings)
(suspenseful music playing)

02:12.803 --> 02:14.365
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

02:14.365 --> 02:15.866
YOU'RE GETTING LANDLINED.

02:15.866 --> 02:17.838
NOBODY CALLS
YOUR HOME PHONE ANYMORE

02:17.838 --> 02:21.141
UNLESS THE SHIZZ
IS SUPES SERIOUS.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.643
(ring)

02:24.445 --> 02:26.847
HELLO?

02:26.847 --> 02:30.251
GRAB A TABLE, BABE.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.923
AH! LOOK WHO GOT
A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

02:32.923 --> 02:35.486
NAH, BRO.
IT'S JUST THE FIRST DATE.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.428
I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET HUNG UP
ON ONE CHICK, YOU KNOW?

02:37.428 --> 02:39.830
BUT THIS TIME, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING SERIOUS.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.693
I JUST WANNA SLAY SOME ASS.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.265
OOH, QUICK TIP--

02:44.265 --> 02:47.768
GUYS WHO SLAY ASS
NEVER SAY "SLAY ASS."

02:47.768 --> 02:50.401
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
PULL OFF BEING A PLAYER.

02:50.401 --> 02:52.343
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SORT OF AN INSTA-COMMITTER.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.545
I MEAN, YOU HAD A GIRL
MOVE IN WITH US AT 5 YEARS OLD

02:54.545 --> 02:56.247
AFTER ONE PLAYDATE.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.608
THAT'S BECAUSE SHE SAID
HER MOM WAS AN ALIEN.

02:57.608 --> 02:59.510
I HAD TO SAVE HER.
BUT NEVER AGAIN, OKAY?

02:59.510 --> 03:02.883
FROM NOW ON, I'M A PLAYER.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.856
THERE'S NO "R." IT'S...
(high-pitched voice) PLAYA!

03:05.856 --> 03:08.519
(telephone rings)
(suspenseful music playing)

03:08.519 --> 03:11.662
UH-OH. LANDLINED.
(ring)

03:11.662 --> 03:14.525
I HOPE NO ONE DIED, BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A DARK SUIT.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.527
(ring)

03:16.527 --> 03:17.828
HELLO?

03:19.370 --> 03:22.933
WHO WANTS TO GO CARRY
AN OLD MAN?

03:22.933 --> 03:25.906
JUST THROW HIM
ON THE COUCH.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.740
WATCH YOUR HANDS, TORRES.
YOU TOUCH ME THERE AGAIN,

03:29.740 --> 03:32.413
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE TO
A BLUE STATE AND GET MARRIED.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.984
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
I CAN GET A GRIP.

03:33.984 --> 03:36.547
NOTHING ON YOUR BODY IS
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

03:36.547 --> 03:37.918
(grunts) THIS WOULD BE
A LOT EASIER

03:37.918 --> 03:40.251
IF WE HAD A WHEELCHAIR.
UHH!

03:40.251 --> 03:41.992
I DON'T NEED
A DAMN WHEELCHAIR.

03:41.992 --> 03:44.425
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE ANKLE FRACTURE.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.498
I WAS BAREBACKING ANNABELLE,
AND SHE BUCKED ME OFF.

03:47.498 --> 03:50.431
OOH! ATTABOY, CHICK-A-BOOM!
GET YOU SOME!

03:50.431 --> 03:52.663
ANNABELLE'S MY HORSE.

03:52.663 --> 03:54.765
(chuckles) OH, MAN.
LOVE IS BLIND.

03:54.765 --> 03:57.308
OKAY, HERE'S SOME CHIPS,

03:57.308 --> 03:59.340
SODA...
OH, AND THE REMOTE.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.513
NOW DON'T BE A PAIN IN THE ASS.
I'M NOT YOUR SERVANT.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.016
(whispers) I'M SO EXCITED
MY DAD'S HERE.

04:06.016 --> 04:08.349
THEN WHY ARE YOU ACTING
SO ME-ISH?

04:08.349 --> 04:09.920
MY DAD WON'T LET ANYONE
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.652
SO TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.484
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND
YOU'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF HIM.

04:13.484 --> 04:14.785
IF I EVER GET IN AN ACCIDENT,

04:14.785 --> 04:16.787
I WANT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

04:16.787 --> 04:18.258
(chuckles and gasps)

04:18.258 --> 04:19.530
(whispers indistinctly)

04:19.530 --> 04:20.961
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.363
IS SHE PRAYING FOR YOU
TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.465
IT'S MY STOMACH.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.896
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T WANT TO
LOOK STUPID WHEN THE PAIN HITS,

04:25.896 --> 04:27.568
SO I'M T-BONING.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.301
TEBOWING. A YEAR LATE,
AND YOU'RE STILL WRONG.

04:30.301 --> 04:32.603
OOH! (kisses) YEAH!

04:32.603 --> 04:33.804
(groans)

04:33.804 --> 04:36.276
CLOSE ME OUT, BARKEEP.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.048
THIS IS A HOGWARTS I.D.

04:38.048 --> 04:39.480
YEAH, I'M JUST PRETENDING
TO PAY, DUDE.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.951
(high-pitched voice)
PLAYER MOVE!

04:40.951 --> 04:42.483
(chuckles) TRAV...

04:42.483 --> 04:43.914
I'M NOT GREAT
WITH THE GALS,

04:43.914 --> 04:45.356
BUT I BET YOU
DAD NUMBER TWO OVER HERE

04:45.356 --> 04:46.587
CAN GIVE YOU SOME POINTERS.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.489
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD,

04:48.489 --> 04:49.760
AND I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO
STOP THINKING WITH YOUR HEART

04:49.760 --> 04:51.061
AND START THINKING
WITH YOUR DISCO STICK.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.593
I THINK I'M GOOD.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.895
BABY, MY PARENTS ARE SO EXCITED

04:54.895 --> 04:56.567
WE'RE DRIVING TO THE KEYS
TOMORROW TO MEET THEM.

04:56.567 --> 05:00.030
(chuckles) OH! I CAN'T WAIT!

05:00.030 --> 05:01.872
TEACH ME.

05:01.872 --> 05:05.536
TRAV WANTS TO BE
A PLAYER NOW?

05:05.536 --> 05:07.077
THAT IS JUST WRONG.

05:07.077 --> 05:08.979
IT'S LIKE WHEN JEWEL RELEASED
THAT POP ALBUM.

05:08.979 --> 05:10.711
BE REAL, GIRLFRIEND!

05:10.711 --> 05:12.483
YOU HAVE A SNAGGLETOOTH,
AND YOU PLAY ACOUSTIC!

05:12.483 --> 05:13.844
UH, WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED
ABOUT TRAVIS?

05:13.844 --> 05:15.646
ALL RIGHT,
LET THE KID HAVE HIS FUN.

05:15.646 --> 05:19.390
YEAH, LET THE BOY TAP SOME..
(high-pitched voice) ASS!

05:19.390 --> 05:22.623
(chuckles) SORRY. TRYING TO SAY
"ASS" BUT IN A COOL WAY.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.695
I AM DYING. WHERE'S JULES?

05:24.695 --> 05:25.996
(telephone rings)

05:25.996 --> 05:27.658
LANDLINED.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.530
HELLO?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.803
OKAY.
(telephone receiver clatters)

05:32.803 --> 05:34.405
DON'T YOU SAY IT.

05:34.405 --> 05:35.936
YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T
GONNA MAKE IT.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.539
SHOULD I REMOVE THESE SEATS?
SHOULD I REMOVE YOUR NUTS?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.810
OH, IT'S NOT YOU.

05:39.810 --> 05:41.742
SHE'S JUST A HORRIBLE PERSON.

05:43.113 --> 05:45.045
HEY, WE DON'T NEED
JULES AND GRAYSON.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.017
WE HAVE PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.420
(clears throat)

05:49.420 --> 05:54.084
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST INVENTED
A REALISTIC SEX ROBOT IN JAPAN.

05:54.084 --> 05:55.656
LOT OF TALK ON THE INTERNET

05:55.656 --> 05:57.127
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
IT'S CHEATING.

05:57.127 --> 06:00.691
I'M GONNA GO TO BATHROOM
BEFORE I KILL MYSELF.

06:02.893 --> 06:04.695
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:04.695 --> 06:07.468
I'M IN THE BATHROOM.
HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOUR DAD?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.570
OH, IT'S AWESOME.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.802
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WHO WON'T
USE CRUTCHES GET UP THE STAIRS.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.645
I'M STILL A MAN, DAMN IT!

06:14.645 --> 06:18.048
JULES, I GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS.
YOU HAVE A KIDNEY STONE.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.910
I HAVE ONLY BEEN
WITH GRAYSON.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.452
NOT AN S.T.D.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.754
OKAY. WELL, GREAT.
SO WHAT NOW?

06:23.754 --> 06:25.055
YOU'LL PASS IT EVENTUALLY,

06:25.055 --> 06:26.887
BUT KIDNEY STONES
ARE REALLY PAINFUL.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.620
(chuckles) I BIRTHED
TRAVIS' GIANT SQUARE HEAD.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.762
I THINK I CAN HANDLE
A TINY STONE.

06:31.762 --> 06:33.063
BESIDES, I'M FINE.
THE PAIN'S GONE.

06:33.063 --> 06:34.565
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT STONES.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.096
YOU CAN GO HOURS
FEELING NOTHING,

06:36.096 --> 06:37.868
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN--
OH! OH, GOD!

06:37.868 --> 06:39.600
(inhales sharply)
OH, THIS IS A BIG ONE!

06:39.600 --> 06:42.633
UH, SOME OF MY PATIENTS
FIND IT SOOTHING IF I SING.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.004
OH, PLEASE DON'T!

06:44.004 --> 06:45.876
(deep voice) в™Є NOBODY KNOWS в™Є
OH!

06:45.876 --> 06:49.079
в™Є THE TROUBLE I'VE S-- в™Є
UHH!

06:54.785 --> 06:56.587
HERE YOU GO.

06:56.587 --> 07:00.621
J-BIRD, I DON'T WANT TO
PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR OWN BED.

07:00.621 --> 07:04.725
TAKE A DAMN NAP. I'M FINE.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.597
AAH! HELP ME!

07:06.597 --> 07:08.058
(strained voice)
I CAN BARELY FEEL MY FEET!
OH! OH!

07:08.058 --> 07:09.730
COME ON, NOW.
THIS IS INSANE.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.201
JUST TELL YOUR DAD THAT
YOU HAVE A KIDNEY STONE.

07:11.201 --> 07:13.704
OH. HE'LL BARELY
LET ME TAKE CARE OF HIM NOW.

07:13.704 --> 07:16.136
IF HE KNEW I WAS ABOUT TO
BLACK OUT IN PAIN, HE'D LEAVE.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.909
OH! (gasps) OHH!

07:18.909 --> 07:20.440
WOW. I HAVE A MORE FUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY DAD,

07:20.440 --> 07:21.972
AND HE'S DEAD.

07:21.972 --> 07:24.915
YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW STUBBORN
MY DAD IS. (grunts)

07:24.915 --> 07:27.718
HE DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.981
FOR SIX MONTHS A YEAR, HE'S
AN HOUR EARLY TO EVERYTHING.

07:30.981 --> 07:32.883
OR AN HOUR LATE.

07:32.883 --> 07:35.726
I'M NOT SURE
WHICH WAY IT IS. OH.

07:35.726 --> 07:37.157
(kisses) AHH.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.889
LOOK, YOU'RE JUST AS STUBBORN
AS HE IS.

07:38.889 --> 07:41.562
I'M NOT STUBBORN.
I'M JUST ALWAYS RIGHT.

07:41.562 --> 07:45.936
OH, I GET THAT.
I'LL BE FINE, DUDE,
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS,

07:45.936 --> 07:48.068
WINDOW DOCTOR HERE IS ABOUT
TO GIVE ME A PAINKILLER SHOT.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.670
(chuckles)

07:49.670 --> 07:52.172
WHY HAVEN'T WE USED HIM
LIKE THIS BEFORE?

07:52.172 --> 07:55.245
YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE PRICK
AND THEN A NEEDLE.

07:55.245 --> 07:57.107
(chuckles) DOCTOR HUMOR.

07:57.107 --> 07:58.549
THAT'S WHY.
(Ellie) MM-HMM.

07:58.549 --> 07:59.850
OOH! WOW.
MM.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.982
(whispers) THERE IT IS.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.714
OKAY, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

08:03.714 --> 08:05.786
YOU GO BACK TO WORK.
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DATE.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.218
(Ellie) WELL, IF I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE JELLY PATROL...

08:08.218 --> 08:09.990
HIT ME.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.522
OW! OW!

08:11.522 --> 08:14.094
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

08:14.094 --> 08:15.566
(elastic snaps)

08:15.566 --> 08:17.798
(all) в™Є IT'S GREASE IN SPACE в™Є

08:17.798 --> 08:19.700
в™Є WITH FLYING CARS в™Є

08:19.700 --> 08:23.133
в™Є GETTING HICKEYS FROM KENICKIE
ON PLANET MARS в™Є

08:23.133 --> 08:25.175
в™Є GREASE IN SPACE в™Є

08:25.175 --> 08:28.078
(Travis and Bobby laugh)
(Grayson) NOW LET'S START CLASS.

08:28.078 --> 08:31.211
LESSON ONE--
HOW TO GET THE LADIES.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.943
LET ME GUESS--

08:32.943 --> 08:35.245
LIE YOUR ASS OFF TILL
THE PANTIES HIT THE FLOOR?

08:35.245 --> 08:38.749
WHOA! PLAYA'S CODE--
NO FALSE PROMISES.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.591
YOU JUST GOTTA BE HONEST
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.993
LIKE WITH ME, IT WAS
NO MORNING CUDDLES,

08:42.993 --> 08:45.696
NO BRUNCH,
OOH, AND NO LEAVE-BEHINDS.

08:45.696 --> 08:48.959
I WILL THROW THOSE FLIP-FLOPS
RIGHT INTO THE TRASH.

08:48.959 --> 08:51.201
SERIOUSLY, THAT WORKS?
JUST BE HONEST?

08:51.201 --> 08:54.735
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU GOTTA THROW IN
A LITTLE GAME. WOW.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.536
WHAT?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.709
(chuckles) OH, NOTHIN'.
IT'S JUST...

08:58.709 --> 09:01.071
I GUESS I'VE NEVER REALLY LOOKED
AT YOUR EYES.

09:01.071 --> 09:04.074
THEY ARE SO BLUE.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.077
GOOD THING I'M NOT BUSY
'CAUSE...

09:07.077 --> 09:10.120
I DON'T THINK I CAN MOVE
UNTIL YOU BLINK.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.224
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT
I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.591
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

09:20.591 --> 09:21.992
SHH.
MM.

09:21.992 --> 09:24.064
YOU'RE HARSHING MY BUZZ.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.666
WE'RE STILL DEBATING
WHETHER OR NOT

09:25.666 --> 09:27.938
BONING A ROBOT IS CHEATING.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.800
(whining) CAN I GET ONE, PLEASE?
I'LL CLEAN AND WALK AND FEED IT.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.072
IT WON'T BE CHEATING.
IT'LL LOOK JUST LIKE YOU.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.875
FINE. GO NUTS.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.747
(laughs)

09:36.747 --> 09:38.278
BUT HOW WOULD YOU CLEAN IT?

09:38.278 --> 09:42.082
I MEAN, DO YOU JUST JAM IT
INTO THE DERSHWERSHER?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.055
(laughing) DERSHWERSHER?

09:45.055 --> 09:47.618
DERSHWERSHER. THERE.

09:47.618 --> 09:50.961
YOUR HAIR LOOKS... AMAZING.

09:50.961 --> 09:55.766
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT I AM FINDING YOU DELIGHTFUL.

09:55.766 --> 09:57.227
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT,

09:57.227 --> 09:59.129
BUT I DIDN'T JUST
FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY

09:59.129 --> 10:00.801
TO COME BACK TO A PLACE WHERE
PEOPLE SLEEP WITH ROBOTS.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.132
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER

10:02.132 --> 10:04.074
AND YOU CAN'T DO IT
TWICE A DAY?

10:04.074 --> 10:06.336
HOW AM I GONNA GET
MY CARDIO?

10:06.336 --> 10:08.979
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ME HOPPING ON THE ELLIPTICAL

10:08.979 --> 10:11.982
OR ME GETTIN'
MY TARGET HEART RATE UP

10:11.982 --> 10:14.214
BY DOING A LITTLE BUMP AND GRIND
WITH A BEEP-BOOP?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.746
WOW. (laughs)

10:15.746 --> 10:18.348
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.
(laughing)

10:18.348 --> 10:20.290
(laughing)

10:20.290 --> 10:22.092
NOT A GREAT TIME, JULES.
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:22.092 --> 10:23.694
THE MEDS WORE OFF.

10:23.694 --> 10:25.696
IT FEELS LIKE A PORCUPINE
IS TRYING TO

10:25.696 --> 10:27.257
crawl out of my hoo.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.700
STUPID WINDOW DOCTOR.
(beep)

10:29.700 --> 10:36.106
(TV playing indistinctly)

10:36.106 --> 10:38.809
WOULD YOU JUMP UP
AND GET THAT REMOTE FOR ME?

10:38.809 --> 10:40.040
(inhales sharply)

10:40.040 --> 10:42.412
OOH! YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:42.412 --> 10:44.114
I LOVE THIS SHOW.

10:44.114 --> 10:46.146
THAT'S A COMMERCIAL.
OH.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.819
AND WHY ARE YOU SWEATING?

10:48.819 --> 10:50.280
OH, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

10:50.280 --> 10:52.022
I DON'T KNOW WHICH CEREAL
HE'S GONNA LIKE.

10:52.022 --> 10:54.124
(laughs) I'LL GET IT MYSELF.

10:54.124 --> 10:55.385
(grunts)

10:55.385 --> 10:57.257
OW! OH! OH! MY ANKLE'S...

10:57.257 --> 10:58.789
OH! OH! IT'S GOING...

10:58.789 --> 11:02.162
(grunts) DOWN.
THE GROUND IS COMING UP.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.734
OH!

11:03.734 --> 11:04.995
DAD, LET ME HELP YOU.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.266
OHH! (gasps) OKAY.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.199
(panting) I'M GOING DOWN, TOO.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.802
UHH! (gasps)

11:11.802 --> 11:14.945
I KNOW WHY
I'M LAYING DOWN HERE.

11:14.945 --> 11:17.047
WHY ARE YOU?

11:17.047 --> 11:19.249
I'VE GOT A KIDNEY STONE.

11:19.249 --> 11:20.981
(groans)
(sighs)

11:20.981 --> 11:23.714
OKAY, LET'S GO OVER
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED.

11:23.714 --> 11:25.115
BE CONFIDENT
BUT NOT ARROGANT.

11:25.115 --> 11:27.017
MORE McCONAUGHEY
IN "DAZED AND CONFUSED,"

11:27.017 --> 11:29.359
LESS McCONAUGHEY
IN "MAGIC MIKE."

11:29.359 --> 11:32.092
BE HONEST
BUT DON'T GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.693
MORE McCONAUGHEY
IN "LINCOLN LAWYER,"

11:33.693 --> 11:36.366
LESS McCONAUGHEY
IN "GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST."

11:36.366 --> 11:39.169
ARE WE GONNA HAVE
ANY NON-McCONAUGHEY EXAMPLES?

11:39.169 --> 11:40.700
(imitates Matthew McConaughey)
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.172
LAST QUESTION.

11:42.172 --> 11:45.135
IT'S 9:00 A.M.
SHE'S STILL IN YOUR BED.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.207
WHAT DO YOU DO, PLAYBOY?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.940
READ HER THE HAIKU I STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT WRITING FOR HER?

11:49.940 --> 11:51.982
I'M KIDDING!

11:51.982 --> 11:53.884
DON'T WORRY. I GOT IT.

11:53.884 --> 11:55.946
WELL, THEN... GO GET HER.

11:55.946 --> 11:57.217
(exhales deeply)

11:57.217 --> 11:58.488
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WAIT, MAN!

11:58.488 --> 12:00.050
YOUR BREATH SMELLS
LIKE TUNA FISH.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.852
YOU'RE EATING
A TUNA FISH SANDWICH.

12:01.852 --> 12:03.794
(laughs) THAT'S RIGHT.

12:03.794 --> 12:06.426
REMEMBER, START HER OFF
WITH A COMPLIMENT.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
PSHH.
MM.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.803
HEY, GIRL.

12:12.803 --> 12:14.264
YOU LOOK LIKE A GREMLIN.

12:14.264 --> 12:15.836
(chuckles)
BUT IN A GOOD WAY.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.437
I MEAN, THEY WERE SO CUTE,
RIGHT?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.469
ANYWAY, I'M NOT, UH,

12:19.469 --> 12:20.971
LOOKING FOR A COMMITMENT.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.513
JUST WANNA TAKE YOU HOME
AND DO STUFF...

12:23.513 --> 12:25.846
TO YOU.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.749
MAN, IT'S LIKE WATCHING
YOUR KID DIE IN BATTLE.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.022
UGH.

12:32.022 --> 12:33.824
(robotic voice) HEY, BOO,

12:33.824 --> 12:36.186
WOULD YOU MAKE SWEET LOVE TO ME
IF I TALKED LIKE THIS?

12:36.186 --> 12:37.858
(clicks tongue)
I'M NOT HIGH ANYMORE.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.860
LAURIE, I HATE THAT OUTFIT.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.832
YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER.

12:41.832 --> 12:44.935
OKAY, WHY IS TRAVIS WASTING
HIS TIME TALKING TO THAT SKANK?

12:44.935 --> 12:47.537
UGH.
LOOK, WHO KNOWS HOW LONG

12:47.537 --> 12:48.999
THESE TWO ARE GONNA BE OKAY
WITH SEX ROBOTS?

12:48.999 --> 12:50.370
YOU HAVE TO GET ON BOARD.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.872
I KNOW THEY COST, LIKE,
60,000 BUCKS APIECE,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.243
BUT MAYBE WE CAN
GO HALVSIES ON ONE.

12:53.243 --> 12:55.405
YOU KNOW, GET...
TWO DIFFERENT HEADS.

12:55.405 --> 12:57.908
I AM NOT MAKING LOVE
TO A ROBOT.

12:57.908 --> 13:00.951
YES, I SAID WHAT YOU THINK
I SAID.

13:00.951 --> 13:02.983
BABE, CALM DOWN.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.384
NO!

13:04.384 --> 13:05.886
FOR ME, IF YOU TRULY
LOVE SOMEONE,

13:05.886 --> 13:07.988
THEN YOU DON'T NEED
ANYTHING ELSE.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.561
WAIT!

13:11.561 --> 13:13.123
SORRY.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.395
WELL, SINCE IT'S JUST US,

13:15.395 --> 13:18.168
YOU WANNA GET A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE AND MAYBE...

13:18.168 --> 13:20.470
MNH. (hums)

13:20.470 --> 13:24.935
OH, I AM SO GETTING A ROBOT.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.507
(Jules) OW! SON OF A BUTT!

13:27.507 --> 13:29.439
IT'S ALMOST PASSED.

13:29.439 --> 13:32.312
THIS STAGE IS WHAT WE DOCTORS
REFER TO AS THE RING OF FIRE.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.144
(Jules) OHH!

13:34.144 --> 13:35.946
AAH!

13:35.946 --> 13:37.217
(wailing loudly)

13:37.217 --> 13:38.588
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES,

13:38.588 --> 13:41.221
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A HORSE GIVING BIRTH.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.154
(Jules sighs) AHH!

13:44.154 --> 13:47.327
(men) AHH!

13:47.327 --> 13:52.162
WHOO! THAT WAS A WILD RIDE!

13:52.162 --> 13:54.865
WHERE'S DAD?
HE LEFT.

13:54.865 --> 13:57.037
(door closes)
DAMN.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.370
TOM SAYS NO MORE SHOTS.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.853
JUST TAKING OFF LIKE THAT?
IT'S NOT COOL.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.456
I KNOW HOW BAD
KIDNEY STONES HURT.

14:16.456 --> 14:20.630
WHEN I PASSED MINE, I BIT
YOUR UNCLE JIM'S PINKIE OFF.

14:20.630 --> 14:24.364
IS THAT WHY HE USED TO TALK
TO US THROUGH THAT HAND PUPPET?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.097
THAT AND A BUNCH
OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES.

14:27.097 --> 14:29.099
HE'S STILL IN JAIL.

14:29.099 --> 14:31.241
358 MORE YEARS.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.605
SO YOU JUST...
DOIN' SOME NIGHT MOWING?

14:35.605 --> 14:37.477
I TRIED TO COME DOWN
AND GET MY MAIL,

14:37.477 --> 14:40.250
BUT THE DAMN THING
RAN OUT OF GAS.

14:40.250 --> 14:44.084
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
J-BIRD. I'M FINE HERE.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.357
OKAY. THEN I'LL JUST
CHECK ON YOU TOMORROW.

14:49.619 --> 14:51.891
I'M KIDDING.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.894
LET ME JUST GIVE YOU
A HAND.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.368
0 FOR 11.

14:58.368 --> 15:00.070
THAT WAS HUMILIATING.

15:00.070 --> 15:03.333
OH, COME ON, BUDDY.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.635
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

15:05.635 --> 15:09.509
I WAS NOT EXPECTING
A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.983
LOOK, THE WORST A GIRL CAN DO
IS SAY "NO."

15:12.983 --> 15:16.146
REALLY? BECAUSE THE LAST
YOUNG LADY I TALKED TO

15:16.146 --> 15:19.119
ASKED ME HOW SEVERE
MY ASPERGER'S WAS.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.151
(whispers)
DOES HE HAVE ASPERGER'S?

15:21.151 --> 15:22.392
(mouths words)

15:22.392 --> 15:24.354
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE IT,
OKAY?

15:24.354 --> 15:28.428
I'M JUST NOT CUT OUT
TO BE A PLAYER. PLAYA.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.231
(sighs) ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, TRAV?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.563
YOU'RE TRYING TO HIT ON GIRLS
LIKE G-MAN.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.066
BUT YOU CAN'T GET ALL BUFF
AND WAX YOUR CHEST

15:36.066 --> 15:38.308
AND CONVINCE GIRLS
THAT YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

15:38.308 --> 15:40.010
HE BARELY CAN.

15:40.010 --> 15:42.042
IT IS A TIGHTROPE.
COME ON.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.944
YOU'RE THIS WEIRD, GOOFY,
NERDY LITTLE DUDE.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.276
OWN IT.

15:46.276 --> 15:47.947
(pats arm)

15:49.549 --> 15:51.281
HI.

15:51.281 --> 15:53.683
I'M TRAVIS COBB.

15:53.683 --> 15:57.687
I OWN A PERFECT REPLICA OF
THE "GHOSTBUSTERS" PROTON PACK,

15:57.687 --> 16:00.460
WHICH I ACTUALLY WEAR
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.292
USUALLY WITH CLOTHES.

16:02.292 --> 16:03.533
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS,

16:03.533 --> 16:05.235
BUT IF YOU WANNA HANG OUT,

16:05.235 --> 16:06.666
BUST THROUGH SEASONS ONE AND TWO
OF "THE WALKING DEAD,"

16:06.666 --> 16:09.269
MAYBE THROW TOGETHER
SOME ARTISAN FLATBREADS

16:09.269 --> 16:13.603
AND ROLL AROUND A LITTLE,
THEN... LET'S DO THIS.

16:13.603 --> 16:15.105
LET'S GO.

16:15.105 --> 16:17.147
REALLY? ALL RIGHT.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.709
OH... KAY.

16:19.709 --> 16:21.311
(high-pitched voice) WAH-HA!

16:21.311 --> 16:24.984
YEAH! (laughs)
YEAH! (laughs)

16:24.984 --> 16:27.417
ARE YOU PACKING?
YEAH. I'M TAKING OFF.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.359
LOOK,
IT'S--IT'S NOT WORKING.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.691
OVER A ROBOT?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.194
THIS IS INSANE.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.696
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. YOU
SHOULD'VE HEARD YOURSELF TODAY.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.298
YOU KNOW, YOU CARE MORE ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TRAVIS

16:38.298 --> 16:40.170
THAN ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.102
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:42.102 --> 16:45.405
LAURIE, I-I LOVE YOU. I DO.

16:45.405 --> 16:49.179
YOU KNOW, BUT... I JUST DON'T
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALL IN.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.780
YOU KNOW,
AND I CAN'T SIT AROUND,

16:50.780 --> 16:53.143
WAITING WITH MY FINGERS CROSSED,
LOSING TO SOME 21-YEAR-OLD

16:53.143 --> 16:56.046
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HE'S IN THE GAME.

16:56.046 --> 16:58.088
LOOK, YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM.

16:58.088 --> 16:59.489
BABE...

17:02.052 --> 17:05.295
LOOK, TELL ME I'M WRONG,
AND I WILL STAY.

17:08.658 --> 17:10.600
YEAH.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.639
(door opens)

17:21.371 --> 17:22.612
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

17:22.612 --> 17:24.774
I TRIED TO HAVE SEX
IN THIS THING,

17:24.774 --> 17:28.047
AND I ALMOST HUNG MYSELF.
(chuckles)

17:28.047 --> 17:31.321
YOUR MOM AND I CONCEIVED YOU
IN A MOVIE THEATER.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.283
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU
TELL ME THAT?

17:33.283 --> 17:36.626
YOU PUT NASTY PICTURES IN
MY HEAD, I DO THE SAME TO YOU.

17:36.626 --> 17:38.188
(chuckles)

17:40.090 --> 17:42.132
DAD, WHY WON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE CARE OF YOU?

17:42.132 --> 17:46.065
OH, HELL, JUNE BUG.
YOU'RE MY LITTLE GIRL.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.799
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

17:49.799 --> 17:53.203
IT'S
A DAD'S WORST NIGHTMARE--

17:53.203 --> 17:55.645
GETTIN' TO THE PLACE

17:55.645 --> 17:59.149
WHERE HIS OWN CHILD
HAS TO BE LOOKING AFTER HIM.

17:59.149 --> 18:03.553
YOU WERE THROWN FROM A HORSE.
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

18:03.553 --> 18:06.656
I WASN'T THROWN.

18:06.656 --> 18:09.319
I FELL TRYING TO GET ON.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.121
I'VE BEEN RIDING
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

18:11.121 --> 18:14.724
I HAVE NEVER FALLEN ONCE.

18:14.724 --> 18:20.270
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE,
THIS GETTING OLD.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.773
I'M JUST LUCKY THAT I HAVE
LIVED SUCH A GREAT LIFE.

18:23.773 --> 18:25.435
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT OLD.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.507
I'M 76, HONEY.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.179
WELL, YOU CAN LIVE...

18:29.179 --> 18:31.281
ANOTHER 40 OR 50 YEARS.

18:31.281 --> 18:32.612
(laughs)

18:32.612 --> 18:37.647
MY MEMORY'S
ALREADY STARTING TO GO.

18:37.647 --> 18:41.221
PRETTY SOON, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET ME DRIVE ANYMORE.

18:41.221 --> 18:45.295
YOU HAVE GOT SO MANY GREAT
THINGS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE.

18:45.295 --> 18:50.200
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T WASTE
A SECOND OF IT ON ME.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.431
OKAY.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.833
WELL, TOUGH CRAP.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.906
I LOVE YOU.

18:56.906 --> 19:00.139
YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
FOR ME, SO...

19:00.139 --> 19:03.713
I'M GONNA DO THE SAME FOR YOU
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

19:03.713 --> 19:09.579
WHAT IF SOMEDAY
I'M NOT "ME" ANYMORE?

19:09.579 --> 19:11.651
(voice breaks) MAYBE YOU WON'T
COMPLAIN SO MUCH.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.283
(laughs)
(laughs)

19:13.283 --> 19:15.154
(sniffles)
(breathes deeply)

19:15.154 --> 19:16.826
OH, AND I COULD PUT YOU IN THOSE
HAWAIIAN SHIRTS THAT YOU HATE.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.289
YOU LOOK SO GREAT.

19:19.289 --> 19:22.232
(grunts)

19:22.232 --> 19:24.163
THANKS.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.166
(sighs)

19:27.166 --> 19:29.168
THANKS BACK.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.772
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:36.506 --> 19:37.907
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:37.907 --> 19:39.549
NO.

19:39.549 --> 19:41.211
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, JELLY.

19:41.211 --> 19:42.552
WHAT? WHAT IS THIS?
WHY ARE YOU BEING NICE TO ME?

19:42.552 --> 19:44.384
DID TOM GIVE YOU ANOTHER SHOT?

19:44.384 --> 19:47.186
NO. LET'S GO MAKE HIM
GIVE US BOTH ONE.
OKAY.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.360
(sighs) OH, MY GOD.
WHAT A DAY.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.921
MY MIND IS SPINNING.

19:51.921 --> 19:53.463
(lowered voice)
DO YOU THINK LAURIE AND TRAVIS

19:53.463 --> 19:55.265
WILL EVER HAPPEN?

19:55.265 --> 19:58.398
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL MY DAD
BE ABLE TO LIVE ON HIS OWN?

19:58.398 --> 20:00.530
(slurring) DERSHWERSHER.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.873
BABE, YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THOSE THINGS.

20:03.873 --> 20:06.936
LIFE IS OPEN-ENDED,
LIKE "INCEPTION"

20:06.936 --> 20:09.709
OR, FOR SOME OF US,
"GREASE."

20:09.709 --> 20:12.982
I HATE OPEN ENDINGS.

20:20.350 --> 20:24.254
(man) в™Є FORGET WHO I AM в™Є

20:28.758 --> 20:31.761
(corkscrew continues rattling)
SERIOUSLY?

20:36.366 --> 20:38.268
YES, I'LL ACCEPT THE CHARGES.

20:38.268 --> 20:39.569
HI, UNCLE JIM.

20:39.569 --> 20:41.641
HELLO, JULES.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.373
OH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.814
HOW'S TRAVIS?

20:44.814 --> 20:46.576
IS HE STILL
A BIT OF A SHUTTERBUG?

20:46.576 --> 20:47.917
OH, YOU KNOW IT.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.680
YEAH, HE LOVES IT.
THAT'S HIS MAJOR.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.951
GOOD FOR HIM.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.954
HA! FOLLOWING HIS DREAMS.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.988
HEY, CAN I TELL YOU
WHERE I BURIED SOMETHIN'?

20:58.988 --> 21:00.860
I GOTTA GET GOING.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.492
I'M ALL OUT OF PORN!
