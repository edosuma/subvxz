I took your car around the

00:28.996 --> 00:30.373
It wasn't fine yesterday.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.172
It stalled out on me 4 times on the way home.

Mr. Sullivan, you don't agree.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.354
Had to fight to get it, too.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.288
And that's when he started
bugging her to quit.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.488
She filed a complaint against
him. What was that about?

08:06.553 --> 08:09.295
Well, they had lunch a few
weeks after they broke up.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.199

08:11.257 --> 08:12.759
They had an argument, that's all.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.703
He was still harassing her.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.101
He kept calling her. Just yesterday
morning, he got her all upset.

- She talk about him?
- Yeah.

She said he was still in touch with her,

08:50.964 --> 08:53.137

09:56.062 --> 09:57.769
Yeah, on her cell phone.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.743
You said it freaked her out.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.938
She pretty near took our heads off.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.945
What was the call? She say anything?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.315
No. I thought it was a hang-up.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.252
She just flipped.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.854
The phone call at work
came in at around 9:00.

10:15.915 --> 10:19.124
Hoyt was in a departmental
meeting, so the call wasn't his.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.722
His car was clean. The guy just didn't do it.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.331
I'll feel better when we find who did.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.235
I just talked to the garage.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.829
They can't find anything wrong with her car.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.699
So she imagined her car problems?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.539
Maybe she imagined being harassed.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.739
She didn't imagine the phone calls.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.984
Her father said that he tested the car.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.457
He drove it around the block a few times.

10:55.588 --> 10:59.468
Yeah, it's Goren. Can I have
Mike down in the garage?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.634
MIKE: We drained the gas tank.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.699
That's when we heard it
rattling around in there.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.143
A ping-pong ball?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.681
When you drive over long distances,

11:10.937 --> 11:14.146
like the airport road or an expressway,

11:15.275 --> 11:18.154
it gets sucked down to the gas line intake,

11:18.511 --> 11:20.718
plugs it up, the car stalls.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.761
When you stop, it floats
back up to the surface.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.293
Car starts up again.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.297
But if you just drive it around the block...

11:27.353 --> 11:30.232
Because of the stop and go, the
ball never gets sucked down.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.826
Car never stalls out.

11:35.995 --> 11:39.067
Ralph, that was Jenny's work.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.136
They have some forms we have to fill out.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.945
What are you doing, sweetheart?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.451
I was just looking at her room.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.349
Oh, sweetie.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.917
I got things to do, okay?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.052
I'm sorry.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.498
So this went into her tank Wednesday

12:03.556 --> 12:05.297
when her car started stalling out.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.996
But she was killed Thursday night.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.437
There was a weather pattern Wednesday.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.940
The afternoon flights were
canceled. She went home early.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.604
Her car was probably sabotaged
in the employee parking lot.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.640
The killer couldn't make
his move until the next day.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.149
So potentially a co-worker.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.845
Her father said she had
to fight for her promotion.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.684
If there was a fight, there was a loser.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.122
Personnel told us you
had seniority in baggage,

12:32.185 --> 12:34.028
but she had more years in the company.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.795
She made a stink, she got the job. Your job.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.358
It wasn't my job.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.468
There was a salary bump with that promotion.

12:42.528 --> 12:43.563
Would've been.

12:43.630 --> 12:47.237
Oh, man, instead you got stuck
in this little hellhole.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.871
I don't mind. I like the guys.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.880
Loyalty counts for something.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.247
Can I bum a smoke from you?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.515
I mean, you can smoke in here, right?

Mr. Tate, lost luggage?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.326
No, no, don't sweat it.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.330
You were just biding your time.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.161

13:20.533 --> 13:21.910

13:22.101 --> 13:24.843

at home at a titty bar.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.408
Oh, right. That's the point.
She wouldn't. Right, Walter?

13:41.187 --> 13:42.666
I almost forgot.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.096
I once busted a stripper.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.833
Her specialty was this
thing with a glow stick.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.374
They do that there?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.668
Yeah, they do that.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.574
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

13:54.634 --> 13:56.944
I can't believe you touched that thing.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.875
Ms. Sullivan did make
a sexual harassment complaint

14:00.940 --> 14:02.385
but not against Walter Tate.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.479
The person involved got a warning.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.114
Can we see the complaint?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.886
It's against our policy.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.486
Well, what did this person
do to Ms. Sullivan?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.030
I can't get into that,

14:13.086 --> 14:17.296
but the general sense was that Ms.
Sullivan was overly sensitive.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.261
Let me guess. It had to do with her locker.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.808
Somebody wrote graffiti on it,
and that's why it was repainted.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.668
Someone slipped something through her vent,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
and that's why she blocked them.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.716
We're battin’ a thousand anyway.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.775
You might as well let us see it.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.680
You understand I'm bending our rules.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.851
I think your rules are used to it.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.794
Playboy pinups in the break
room, dirty cartoons...

14:46.853 --> 14:49.333
That's from our inspection of the workplace.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.959
Her complaint wasn't about that.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.095
Well, I guess she wasn't
all that overly sensitive.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.036
The complaint was against Desmond McCarthy.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.805
The big guy in the locker room.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.006
Yeah, he exposed himself to her.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.709
He put the glow stick on her car seat.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.480
He poured urine through
the vents of her locker.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.113
Jenny cataloged everything he did.

15:11.177 --> 15:16.058
Every obscene gesture, every piece of
graffiti, dates, times, witnesses.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.619
Did she have notes or a journal?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.960
He told us she had a
spiral notebook with her.

15:24.190 --> 15:27.364
Oh, I didn't ever saw anything like that.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.374
She ever say anything to you
about her problems at work?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.273
We talked about other things.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.707
Who makes the bed?

15:36.035 --> 15:37.446
SUSAN: Jenny does.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.714
She likes things neat.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.991
Eames.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.997
EAMES: So this is where she hid the notebook.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.310
What's going on?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.305
We've been talking about

16:13.873 --> 16:17.252
how good Jenny was doing at her job.
You must be proud of her.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.655
Sure. I was proud.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.892
My dad's a retired cop.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.451
When I've got a beef at work,

16:24.517 --> 16:26.258
I go to him. Is that what Jenny did?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.821
She came to you with her problems?

16:27.887 --> 16:31.425
Yeah, sure. Everybody has
a bad day one time or another.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.902
You can't let it get to you.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.529
EAMES: That's what you taught Jenny?

16:34.594 --> 16:37.507
Don't show weakness? Be strong?

16:39.899 --> 16:42.175
When she told you some guy
at work was ragging her,

16:42.235 --> 16:44.340
you told her to just tough it out.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.245
The guy was just a jerk.

16:47.306 --> 16:50.776
Did you know she filed a complaint
against him with the company?

16:55.281 --> 16:57.124
GOREN: You're not surprised.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.760
You know what's on the complaint.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.423
You read her notebook.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.826
- No.
- Yes, you did.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.499
And now you're taking it on yourself

17:08.560 --> 17:11.734
because you're thinking maybe you
should've listened more carefully

17:11.797 --> 17:13.276
to what Jenny said.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.910
And that's why you're not
telling anyone about it.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.874
I didn't know.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.743
She tried to tell me.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.185
I'm sorry.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.452
I'm sorry.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.632
EAMES: "While in the break room,
McCarthy started telling me

17:37.690 --> 17:40.068
"about a video about
women who used sex toys.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.936
"When I told him to stop,
he exposed his genitals to me.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.497
"I left the room.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.569
"August 12, 5:10 p.m.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.374
"While on my way to the locker room,

17:49.435 --> 17:51.608
"Jack Martinez stopped me
to discuss a work order.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.345
"Later, when I approached my
locker, I saw McCarthy leaving.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.786
"When I opened my locker, I found
everything soaked in urine."

17:57.910 --> 17:59.446
What a living hell.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.352
EAMES: The airline just gave
this bozo a slap on the wrist.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.952
That sends a message.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.498
Well, no wonder McCarthy's
buddies got in on the act.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.195
Here.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.670
"Walter Tate, McCarthy
and Martinez engaged in

18:13.726 --> 18:16.570
"a lively discussion of
their rape fantasies."

18:19.065 --> 18:23.036
Martinez is the guy who distracted her.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.976
While McCarthy messed with her locker.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.449
GOREN: And here.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.218
On her way to the parking lot,
Tate and Bill Stuart told her

18:32.278 --> 18:34.280
what they saw at the strip club.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.620
When she got to her car, the
glow stick was on the seat.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.790
These guys conspired to harass her.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.959
Maybe not just to harass her.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.400
You see what she wrote here?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.838
It's a week before she died.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.068
The address on Fordham Place.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.872
It's the State Human Rights Division.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.072
She was filing a complaint with the State.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.046
She was going for the jugular.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.312
And they went for her’s.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.778
WALTER: Who told you this?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.345
Guy who works the desk at human resources.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.622
I give him a ride sometimes.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.853
- This is crap.
- What did he say exactly?

19:09.915 --> 19:12.555
They found the complaint
she made on bright boy here.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.656
- I'm not taking the fall for this.
- Just relax, would you?

19:15.721 --> 19:17.359
You relax, Martinez!

19:17.857 --> 19:21.066
No, you know what? Don't relax.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.833
'Cause if they try to hang this murder on me,

19:23.896 --> 19:25.898
I'm not the only one going down.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.739
(MUSIC PLAYING)

19:31.637 --> 19:35.084
What motive? You just said the Human
Rights division never heard from her.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.814
She hadn't made up her mind yet.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.083
She was scared. She'd been burned before.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.285
But if these guys got wind she was
even thinking of going to the State...

19:42.348 --> 19:43.952
Appalling as their behavior is,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.927
it doesn't predispose them to murder.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.125
They threatened her with
rape. They fondled her.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.725
Yes, they did. But there is not
a single case on the books

19:51.791 --> 19:55.830
proving a causal relationship between
sexual harassment and murder.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.966
Not a single case until now.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.002
Not with this evidence.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.401
These men may have been pigs,

20:02.468 --> 20:05.039
but that doesn't make them
killers. I'm sorry.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.981
Her notebook mentions her confiding
in the other supervisor,

20:12.044 --> 20:13.387
Keith Ramsey.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.821
It's interesting. He never
said anything to us.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.864
Sure. I knew what was going on.
It was hard to miss.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.456
And she told you about it?

20:22.521 --> 20:23.795
We talked about it.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.858
She wrote it in her notebook.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.002
She kept a very detailed chronicle.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.006
Yeah, well, then you know I wasn't involved.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.532
Right, we got that. What we don't
get is why you didn't tell us.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.972
Because it didn't have
anything to do with her death.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.878
You know, I told corporate what was going on.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.746
It was up to them to come down on those guys.

20:39.805 --> 20:40.977
Why didn't you?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.782
You're their supervisor.
Are you afraid of them?

20:44.643 --> 20:45.951
(STAMMERS)

20:46.011 --> 20:47.285
I can take care of myself.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.121
But you didn't take care of Jenny.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.025
She wrote in her notebook you're
the only guy she trusted.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.758
Or maybe you enjoyed seeing
her get tormented.

20:55.521 --> 20:56.795
Where is this coming from?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.130
Eames, please.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.931
We need to call in anyway.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.676
This case has brought out the...

21:07.733 --> 21:10.907
what's the code word? “Feminist”
in my partner.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.010
Well, it's all right.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.983
You know, she's an attractive woman

21:15.040 --> 21:18.385
in what used to be a man's
job. It can't be easy.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.249
Attractive?

21:21.213 --> 21:22.954
If hostility turns you on.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.456
That's not what I meant.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.230
If you wanna know, that's more my type.

21:33.526 --> 21:38.236
Not bad, if you like
high-maintenance ball-busters.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.843
No. You see, I like women.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.704
They don't always get a fair shake.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.980
So you have no problem
with Jenny working in...

21:49.842 --> 21:52.550
How did you put it,
what used to be a man's job?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.352
Of course not.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.993
I told those guys that she deserved a chance.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.366
You know, I hope you're
wrong about those guys.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.835
I have to go.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.207
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:28.981 --> 22:33.054
The new age man. He likes
women, he understands them.

22:33.619 --> 22:34.996
He tried to help Jenny.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.556
And still she's dead.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.533
Another ineffectual nice guy.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.197
I wonder how helpful he really was.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.767
These memos from Keith Ramsey
are about work procedures.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.480
Where are the ones about sexual harassment?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.949
We never got anything from him about that.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.647
These memos concern his comments on
work proposals made by Ms. Sullivan.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.020
"Putting more security
in the baggage terminal

23:00.079 --> 23:02.218
"will result in additional costs.

23:02.281 --> 23:06.559
"Ms. Sullivan's proposal
requires further study."

23:07.887 --> 23:11.130
Ms. Sullivan, she wanted more
security in her department?

23:11.624 --> 23:13.001
Apparently, yes.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.036
EAMES: She thought incoming
mailbags were spending

23:15.094 --> 23:16.402
too much time in the terminal.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.238
She proposed rescheduling
pick-ups by the post office.

23:19.298 --> 23:22.006
Ramsey said that she overstated the problem.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.812
Every chance that he gets, he submarines her.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.414
What's the date on her memo
about the mailbags?

23:32.544 --> 23:33.921
August 25.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.220
McCarthy poured urine
in her locker on the 27th.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.028
Her security memo?

23:40.819 --> 23:42.594
September 15th.

23:43.489 --> 23:47.562
On September 18, she found
the glow stick in her car.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.206
They were harassing her
in response to her memos.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.242
Mailbags and security. Touchy subjects.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.413
Identity fraud?

24:02.474 --> 24:04.010
You have my attention.

24:04.076 --> 24:07.546
Jenny complained that her workers
were taking unscheduled breaks.

24:07.613 --> 24:12.119
These breaks coincided with flights
arriving from Sioux City and Bakersfield.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.857
All the flights carried mailbags.

24:13.919 --> 24:17.594
Sioux City is a distribution center
for major credit card companies.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.397
Bakersfield is headquarters

24:19.458 --> 24:21.836
for two credit reporting companies.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.430
That's what was in those mailbags,

24:23.495 --> 24:25.372
credit cards and credit reports.

24:25.431 --> 24:26.705
Which were being stolen.

24:26.765 --> 24:28.301
Which is what Jenny Sullivan uncovered?

24:28.367 --> 24:30.677
There's no evidence that she
knew what was going on.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.181
She was doing her job.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.443
CARVER: Getting in the way.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.416
They tried to drive her out by harassing her.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.613
When that didn't work, they killed her.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.952
The FBI has to be brought in on this.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.923
Who's the ringleader, Ramsey?

24:43.115 --> 24:46.119
The murder seems out of character for him.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.456
The evidence against him won't
support an arrest warrant anyway.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.399
We'll start with the others.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.596
She was wound too tight.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.004
I just ragged on her so
she'd loosen up, you know.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.700
Yeah, loosen up.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.613
Is that why you think the FBI's here?

25:09.641 --> 25:11.552
It's the mailbags, Desmond.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.153
That's why you wanted her to loosen up.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.891
That's why you killed her.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.156
I never went near those bags.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.394
I took those breaks 'cause I
have a medical condition.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.801
Right, the Sioux City mailbag syndrome.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.568
I hear it's contagious.
Your buddies all caught it.

25:30.629 --> 25:33.803
I swear I never opened those bags.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.377
You're the only one of those
guys who touched her.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.416
And killing her was that much easier?

25:39.471 --> 25:40.950
It wasn't me.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.047
I got nothing to say about mailbags.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.483
But the killing, I'm not
taking the hit for that.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.451
That was Walt. Walter Tate.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.587
He messed with her car.

25:52.951 --> 25:54.988
I did not steal from mailbags.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.625
That's a federal crime. I'm no idiot.

25:57.689 --> 25:58.963
I got a wife and kids.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.867
Maybe you didn't steal, Walter,

26:00.926 --> 26:02.803
but maybe you know those other guys did.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.204
Desmond and Stuart.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.005
You're not gonna get me to
say anything about anybody.

26:07.066 --> 26:11.412
Well, you got a lot more character than
your buddies, Walter, I'll give you that.

26:11.503 --> 26:15.007
One of them told us that you were seen
putting something in Jenny's tank.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.485
That's a damn lie!

26:18.710 --> 26:20.417
You talk to Bill Stuart.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.082
You ask him why he washed
out the trunk of his car

26:23.148 --> 26:24.752
the day after the murder.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.127
That's right. People saw him.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.632
I'm not going down for this.

26:29.688 --> 26:31.258
I did not kill her.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.236
If you know who did, Bill, now's the time.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.933
Martinez. It’s Martinez.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.478
Martinez drove out after her that night.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.741
Somebody saw him.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.750
I just put the mailbags in a room

26:47.806 --> 26:50.309
and those other guys,
they took stuff out of them.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.685
No. See, Martinez, you did more than

26:52.744 --> 26:55.020
just push mailbags around the terminal.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.616
There's what you did to Jenny.

26:56.682 --> 26:59.526
That sex stuff? Yeah, that wasn't my idea.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.757
I liked her.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.958
Everybody was giving her such a hard time,

27:03.021 --> 27:05.467
and she still brought us homemade cookies.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.696

27:07.426 --> 27:09.565
Keith said it was a peace offering.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.866
EAMES: Something must've
been wrong with her baking

27:11.930 --> 27:14.410
because somebody saw you
following her that night.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.104
MARTINEZ: They didn't see me.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.739
Desmond. He's the one followed her.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.179
There isn't enough against Ramsey.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.777
But with Martinez's statement,

27:23.842 --> 27:27.187
the Bureau can proceed against
McCarthy, Stuart and Tate

27:27.246 --> 27:28.987
for mail theft and fraud.

27:29.515 --> 27:33.122
As far as the murder, well,
that's your jurisdiction.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.588
Thanks for your help.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.358
Well, at least they said thank you.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.232
So now we have 4 murder suspects.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.329
And 4 witnesses and 4 sets of facts.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.396
This is not a promising development.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.101
EAMES: These guys could've orchestrated this.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.473
Not these 4.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.573
Someone fed them those stories.

27:49.635 --> 27:52.707
The same mind that put the
ping-pong ball in Jenny's car

27:53.705 --> 27:55.742
is now playing ping-pong with us.

27:57.709 --> 28:00.087
I had a very nice time. It's not that.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.493
I just have a big day tomorrow.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.794
I'll call you later this week.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.696
Keith, I'll call you, okay?

28:11.890 --> 28:13.426
I better get my coat.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.278
SIMON: Keith. Keith.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.757
Tell me some news, Keith.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.691
We need to get back to business.

28:37.749 --> 28:40.628
I told you I can't get
the documents right now.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.063
It's too dangerous.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.691
The cops are questioning my guys.

28:44.756 --> 28:47.327
Your guys, they can hurt you.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.368
My guys only know what I tell them.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.136
You don't have to worry about them.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.369
Okay.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.245
Then I just worry about you.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.718
Our new best friends at the FBI traced

29:08.780 --> 29:11.386
the usage of the card numbers
stolen from the airport.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.726
So far they're showing
over a million dollars

29:13.785 --> 29:16.197
in long distance calls to Eastern Europe.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.433
Our boys must be fencing
the cards to the Russians.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.664
Such lovely business partners.

29:22.728 --> 29:24.002
What're you looking for?

29:24.062 --> 29:26.440
Cookies. Martinez said
that Jenny made them cookies.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.603
(STAMMERING)
But it's not in here.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.644
Maybe she had other things on her mind.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.541
She wrote down everything else.

29:33.605 --> 29:38.520
Here. Ramsey told her he discussed her
harassment with a woman's rights lawyer.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.954
More bull.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.892
She wrote down the lawyer's
name. Lucia Hastings.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.724
Can you look it up in the
bar association directory?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.390
Probably the only bar Lucia's associated with

29:48.453 --> 29:50.729
is the cocktail lounge at the airport.

29:50.822 --> 29:52.199
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

29:52.691 --> 29:55.365
Well, what do you know. Lucia Hastings.

29:55.527 --> 29:58.007
Associate at Markham & Frasier.

30:01.533 --> 30:05.379
Like I said on the phone,
I don't know Keith very well.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.042
Is one of his employees suing him?

30:08.340 --> 30:10.786
Executives are such easy targets.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.820
Executives like Keith?

30:15.013 --> 30:17.550
He mentioned ever since he became a...

30:18.083 --> 30:19.460
I'm so bad with titles.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.656
Vice President.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.892
Yeah, I know. But of what?
Do you still have his card?

30:22.954 --> 30:25.093
Vice President of Operations.

30:25.691 --> 30:29.298
I'm curious. How did my name come up?

30:30.062 --> 30:32.008
You made an impression on him.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.807
But then again, you are
his type. You met socially?

30:36.868 --> 30:40.281
At a club. Ahmad's in SoHo.
Couple of months ago.

30:40.739 --> 30:44.152
So what's he done? Embezzled company funds?

30:44.743 --> 30:46.848
I'm surprised that you'd say that.

30:48.013 --> 30:53.156
(STAMMERING)
'Cause, you know, he's such a nice guy.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.262
Well, sure, he was nice.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.129
EAMES: Nice enough to date?

30:57.289 --> 30:59.394
I let him take me out to dinner.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.165
How did the evening end?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.696
Not the way he hoped.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.978
And when you told him that you weren't
interested, how did he take it?

31:09.601 --> 31:11.239
He just got very quiet.

31:11.636 --> 31:13.673
I gave the waiter my card
to pay for the drinks.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.946
I thought that was the least I could do.

31:16.007 --> 31:17.918
Then I went to the powder room.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.512
When I got back, Keith was gone,

31:19.578 --> 31:21.251
and I haven't heard from him since.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.260
Later on, did you notice anything
missing from your purse?

31:24.316 --> 31:25.454
No.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.121
How about your wallet?

31:27.552 --> 31:29.759
- Credit card that you left on the table?
- No.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.664
It was there when I got back.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.031
How about when you got your
bill at the end of the month?

31:37.195 --> 31:40.233
Well, as a matter of fact,
someone had charged

31:40.298 --> 31:43.177
a bunch of phone calls
to Sarajevo of all places.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.444
Of all places.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.652
EAMES: He stole her credit card number

31:49.708 --> 31:51.654
and passed it on to his Russian buddies.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.485
CARVER: He masquerades as an airline exec.

31:53.545 --> 31:54.956
That's what he does for sport?

31:55.013 --> 31:57.789
Well, it's not a sport.
It's how he sees himself.

31:58.083 --> 32:01.257
The waitresses at Ahmad's said he
comes in a couple of nights a week,

32:01.319 --> 32:03.321
in a business suit, flashing a roll,

32:03.388 --> 32:06.335
chats up one or two ladies
and usually goes home alone.

32:06.391 --> 32:09.372
Home being The Dakota
across the hall from Yoko.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.964
At least that's what he told the bartender.

32:11.029 --> 32:12.565
I wish we could give him a new home.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.668
The phone charges on Lucia Hastings' card

32:14.733 --> 32:16.713
tie him to the mail theft ring.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.406
That still leaves the murder.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.575
Ramsey doesn't like confrontation.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.351
It would take something
deeply threatening to trigger

32:23.408 --> 32:25.945
the kind of rage that killed Jenny Sullivan.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.358
I don't know what that trigger could be.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.227
I can't see it yet.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.022
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:38.590 --> 32:39.694
Thank you.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.533
And one for the lady?

32:42.127 --> 32:43.538
- No, thanks.
- Please.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.833
I've been on the phone all day trying
to avert another airline strike.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.504
And the only thing that'll
make me feel better

32:49.568 --> 32:51.912
is if I can buy a beautiful woman a drink.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.916
Well, thank you.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.479
Thank you for accepting.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.388
I am Keith.

32:59.744 --> 33:00.848
Steffi.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.190
What airline do you work for, Keith?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.524
Trans Union.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.862
I'm Vice President of Operations.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.862
There's gonna be a strike?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.438
Right now, I couldn't care less.

33:15.894 --> 33:17.339
EAMES: Hi, Keith.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.436
How fabulous to run into you.
I just got off the Concorde.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.004
You know, when you finally take
over that airline of yours,

33:25.070 --> 33:27.277
you should really buy a couple of those.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.876
They are so fabulous. And who's this?

33:29.941 --> 33:32.217
- Hi, I'm Alex.
- Steffi.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.484
Steffi. What a cute name.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.119
- EAMES: And you remember Bob?
Bob, the shipping magnate?
- Hi, Keith.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.089
Did Alex tell you what she does for a living?

33:42.888 --> 33:44.834
She's a queen.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.392
Queen of Sheba.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.233
(CHUCKLING)
They're pulling your leg.

33:48.293 --> 33:52.833
No, no. Shipping magnate. Queen of Sheba.

33:52.898 --> 33:56.675
And what was it, Vice President
of Trans Union Airlines?

34:00.839 --> 34:02.182
It's so fabulous.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.277
Why don't the 3 of us go back to our place

34:04.342 --> 34:05.878
and talk about our fabulous jobs?

34:05.944 --> 34:08.049
You know, you two are very
funny, but Steffi and I...

34:08.112 --> 34:09.786
We even brought you an invitation.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.327
We insist, Keith.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.860
(HANDCUFFS SNAPPING)

34:21.092 --> 34:22.230
I'm sorry.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.900
Backlog in night court.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.967
Two hour wait to get an attorney
appointed to represent you.

34:28.033 --> 34:32.311
But I ran into two attorneys
I know who are taking cases.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.040
Mr. Drotos, Ms. Broderick.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.914
Both excellent. They've
looked at the complaint.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.319
Your choice, Mr. Ramsey.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.456
Mr. Drotos, why don't you have a seat?

34:46.618 --> 34:47.790
All right.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.367
No, wait. I don't want him. I want her.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.173
(DOOR CLOSING)

35:03.201 --> 35:04.578
EAMES: Do you two need a minute?

35:04.636 --> 35:07.139
- Yeah, that would...
- No. I don't need a minute.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.845
I didn't have anything
to do with any mail theft.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.945
These charges are ridiculous.

35:13.478 --> 35:16.482
So if you had $3,600 on you,

35:16.548 --> 35:18.653
we shouldn't think anything of it?

35:21.519 --> 35:23.157
A friend repaid a loan.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.028
And this money clip, these cufflinks.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.463
They're from Bulgari.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.472
How much do you make
a year? Fifty, sixty grand?

35:33.898 --> 35:35.036
Those are gifts.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.738
From your many admirers?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.109
This...

35:38.870 --> 35:42.113
It's a Kiton jacket. That's $5,000.

35:42.340 --> 35:46.447
Was this a gift or did it fall out
of a suitcase in the lost and found?

35:46.611 --> 35:49.717
Mr. Ramsey, you shouldn't
answer any of their questions.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.089
(CHUCKLES)

35:51.149 --> 35:53.652
Keith, I'm not sure, but I think I detected

35:53.718 --> 35:56.130
a tone of condescension in her voice.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.359
Detective.

35:58.089 --> 36:02.799
You know, Keith might just be a
supervisor of baggage handlers,

36:02.861 --> 36:06.604
but he's really a lot more sophisticated
than you give him credit for.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.333
Let's stay on point.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.476
All right, the point is,
is that he is a high-flying

36:13.538 --> 36:16.781
airline executive trapped
in the life of a nobody.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.843
I mean, isn't that right, Keith?

36:19.878 --> 36:22.586
You are reading way too much into this.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.151
(SIGHS)
It was a hustle.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.627
If you just wanted to get lucky,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.722
you should've hit on the
waitresses at Ahmad's.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.289
They think you're pretty cute.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.562
He doesn't want waitresses. Do you?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.271
You want thoroughbreds.

36:35.326 --> 36:36.896
(CHUCKLING)

36:37.462 --> 36:38.634
Why not?

36:38.697 --> 36:41.109
And that's why you stole the credit cards

36:41.933 --> 36:45.005
to bankroll this man of the
world you needed to be.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.846
I had nothing to do with that.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.517
Do you remember Lucia Hastings?

36:52.177 --> 36:54.316
You mentioned her to Jenny.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.290
Jenny wrote about everything.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.521
He lifted her credit card number.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.190
I did no such thing.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.662
These are the calls to Eastern Europe
that were charged to her card.

37:06.991 --> 37:09.733
The same phone numbers
also appear on the bills

37:09.794 --> 37:13.105
for credit cards stolen from
the mailbags at the airport.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.540
I did not lift Lucia's credit card number.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.205
I'm not some creep.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.682
Before we arrested him, we
searched your apartment.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.518
Not the one at The Dakota, the other one.

37:26.778 --> 37:30.521
And we found these things in
a drawer in your bedroom.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.018
It's a Chanel scarf.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.163
A young woman left it behind.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.862
A silver business card holder

37:41.559 --> 37:43.232
with the business cards.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.108
A gold Dunhill lighter.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.313
I tried to return that.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.208
(LAUGHING)

37:55.073 --> 37:59.283
Mr. Ramsey, I really think we need
to talk before this continues.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.787
This must be really embarrassing for you.

38:04.883 --> 38:09.696
For a classy woman to
see you for what you are.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.397
It's not what you think.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.294
You know what I think?

38:14.726 --> 38:16.171
I think that

38:17.529 --> 38:22.171
you really resent women
who frustrate your plans.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.977
Like Lucia, like Jenny.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.674
I tried to help Jenny.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.210
Isn't that what the notebook said?

38:30.008 --> 38:31.419
That I helped her?

38:31.543 --> 38:33.489
You wanted her out of the way.

38:35.213 --> 38:36.817
It was those other guys.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.986
I told her not to provoke them.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.031
But she baked them cookies.
How was that provocative?

38:44.122 --> 38:47.035
Where'd you hear about that?
Did she write about it?

38:47.425 --> 38:49.132
No, she didn't.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.706
You told the guys that
they were a peace offering.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.672
Yeah, I told Jenny they
wouldn't appreciate it.

39:06.711 --> 39:09.089
You were worried there for a moment.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.454
(STAMMERING)
No, what do you mean?

39:15.286 --> 39:17.493
That she'd written about the cookies.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.528
She wrote about everything else.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.937
Each instance of sexual harassment

39:23.995 --> 39:26.134
but not one word about the cookies.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.071
What is the big deal about a tin of cookies?

39:30.501 --> 39:32.606
She didn't bake them for the guys.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.243
She baked them for you.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.210
No.

39:37.442 --> 39:39.820
That's why she didn't write
about it 'cause it was private.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.880
I mean, she had a thing for you.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.887
I don't know anything about it.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.222
Well, why not?

39:45.483 --> 39:47.929
A man of the world. How could you miss it?

39:47.986 --> 39:49.226
No, no,

39:49.387 --> 39:53.426
you gave her a shoulder to cry on.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.027
Right?

39:56.094 --> 39:59.439
And she looked up at you
with those big cow eyes.

39:59.497 --> 40:00.601
That's insulting!

40:00.665 --> 40:02.838
No, no, no, you see, I get it now.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.380
She liked you.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.282
But the funny thing is, with
all her memos and complaints,

40:11.342 --> 40:13.288
she was gonna screw everything up for you.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.846
- No more Steffis.
- Not true.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.824
No more man of the world.

40:17.682 --> 40:20.288
The only thing that would be left would be

40:21.753 --> 40:23.198
Jenny Sullivan.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.433
The booby prize.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.166
That would never happen.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.865
Jenny thought it could.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.640
How could she?

40:33.698 --> 40:35.507
(STUTTERING)
How could she think

40:35.566 --> 40:38.604
that I would even be seen
with somebody like her?

40:39.003 --> 40:41.210
Well, why not?

40:42.140 --> 40:45.246
I mean, maybe she didn't look
so hot in a cocktail dress,

40:45.310 --> 40:47.381
but unlike those uptown girls,

40:47.445 --> 40:51.291
she would've gladly jumped into
the sack with you with both feet.

40:51.582 --> 40:55.359
Never in a million years would I
let something like that happen.

40:55.420 --> 40:56.455
Mr. Ramsey...

40:56.521 --> 40:57.864
Shut up.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.608
So why were you so resistant?

41:10.768 --> 41:13.305
Is it because you thought she was crummy?

41:13.371 --> 41:16.750
Like your job, like your office?

41:16.808 --> 41:19.220
She just didn't belong.

41:19.277 --> 41:20.415
Like you?

41:24.649 --> 41:27.493
You were afraid that people would think

41:27.552 --> 41:32.399
that girl is the best, a crummy, little
nobody like Keith could ever hope for.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.898
No. I am better than that.

41:35.326 --> 41:39.297
Well, Jenny presumed to think otherwise,

41:39.364 --> 41:41.310
and so you taught her a lesson.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.810
It was those other guys.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.306
Keith,

41:50.341 --> 41:52.753
she would've never gotten into their car.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.050
She didn't trust them.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.792
She only trusted you.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.366
And that's why we know you did it, Keith.

42:07.492 --> 42:10.735
You looked at her and you saw yourself.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.971
Your true, crummy self.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.842
And that made you angry at her.

42:17.502 --> 42:20.108
She got in your way, right?

42:20.171 --> 42:22.082
And you got angry at her.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.778
She loved you, and you were angry at her.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.524
She trusted you. Angry.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.320
So you beat the life out of her.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.724
God! No!

42:31.783 --> 42:32.955
You punished her!

42:33.017 --> 42:35.520
That dumpy bitch! Why didn't she just quit?

42:35.586 --> 42:37.122
Why didn't she...

42:37.588 --> 42:39.590
Don't look at me that way!

42:41.225 --> 42:43.171
Don't look at me.

42:45.696 --> 42:46.766
(YELLING)

42:59.177 --> 43:00.588
CARVER: That's the problem with most men.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.989
They want what they can't get,
and don't want what they have.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.823
No. The problem with men
is they talk too much.
