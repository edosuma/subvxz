00:00.600 --> 00:05.170
Does every animal have their
copy of "Wuthering Hooves"?

00:09.142 --> 00:13.078
Hooray! I love Furry
Friends Book Club.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.314
Now let's discuss
the theme of nature

00:15.316 --> 00:17.282
as it applies to
Hoofcliff's love--

00:19.252 --> 00:21.620
Did somepony leave a light on?

00:24.124 --> 00:25.290
Oh, It's me.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.494
OH! It's me!

00:33.233 --> 00:35.334
We'll continue this
discussion when I get back!

00:36.503 --> 00:37.503
[door clicks closed]

00:38.304 --> 00:41.206

You're here!

01:26.720 --> 01:27.586
[poof]

01:30.290 --> 01:33.826
Oh, you were called
too! Thank goodness.

01:33.828 --> 01:36.328
I feel so much better
going with a friend.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.331
I was about to come and get
you but then I got distracted.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.200
Oh.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.568
Ever since the
map called us,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.269
I've been doing a
ton of research.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.306
Testing out potential
friendship problems,

01:47.308 --> 01:50.609
diversifying my
solution portfolio...

01:50.611 --> 01:51.610
[pop]

01:51.612 --> 01:54.279
"Ever since the map called us"?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.582
But that happened
five minutes ago.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.585
I know, but I want to be one
hundred percent prepared.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.620
I mean, I'm the
Princess of Friendship.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.590
How would it look if I couldn't
solve a friendship problem?

02:04.592 --> 02:07.459
Oh, I'm so lucky I'm
being sent with you.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.862
Speaking of which,
where are we going?

02:09.864 --> 02:11.730
The Smokey Mountains!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.300
Oh, I've never
been there before.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.470
Neither have I. And there isn't
a lot of information on them.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.139
All I could find was this.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.609
"The Smokey Mountains harbor
the most beautiful valley

02:23.611 --> 02:27.880
in all of Equestria between its
two majestic mountain peaks."

02:27.882 --> 02:29.648
That's gorgeous.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.452
And where there's nature,
there's a ton of animal friends!

02:33.454 --> 02:35.320
I can't wait to
get started.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.456
I'm a little nervous, since
that's all I could find.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.292
I usually like to be
a bit more prepared.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.195
You seem pretty
prepared to me.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.466
Are those...for us?

02:47.468 --> 02:51.937
Yup! I've prepared our things:
Snacks, books, blankets, books.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.372
You said books twice.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.706
There are a lot of books.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.310
Oof!

02:59.679 --> 03:02.181
What do you think our friendship
problem's going to be?

03:02.183 --> 03:06.718
I don't know. But I'm
sure we'll figure it out.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.925
Do you think it'll be
a problem about lying?

03:12.927 --> 03:15.928
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get there.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.329
You're right.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.635
Ooh! Could it be about when two
friends just randomly decide

03:23.637 --> 03:25.704
to do something together
but they forget to invite

03:25.706 --> 03:28.273
the third friend and the
third friend feels left out?

03:30.743 --> 03:32.945
Or where one friend tells
another friend's secret

03:32.947 --> 03:34.680
after they ask them not to?

03:34.682 --> 03:38.650
We'll know very, very soon,
since we're almost there.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.427
Here, let me get that.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.995
Oh, thank you.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.397
Sorry I've been a little
scidilly-bopty-boo.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.400
I just can't believe this
is finally happening!

03:55.402 --> 03:57.369
[whoosh]

03:59.340 --> 04:03.642
Whoa. What in
Equestria is happening?

04:03.644 --> 04:06.278
It's nothing like your
book said it would be.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.513
Oh, boy, I'm feeling
very unprepared.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.715
Where do we even start?

04:09.717 --> 04:14.519
Maybe by figuring out where the
flying pumpkins are coming from?

04:16.489 --> 04:17.456
Ready?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.591
<i>â™ª [banjo picking] </i>

04:19.593 --> 04:20.626
Aim.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.760
â™ª

04:21.762 --> 04:23.562
Fire!

04:23.564 --> 04:24.563
[boom]

04:26.599 --> 04:32.004
Um, hi, hello. Excuse us,
but... what are you doing?

04:32.006 --> 04:34.606
We're pumpkining our neighbors!

04:34.608 --> 04:39.745
Yes. But, umm, why are you
pumpkining your neighbors?

04:39.747 --> 04:44.716
Well, because the McColts
are just plain rotten.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.387
Hey, wait a tick.
Who are you two?

04:48.389 --> 04:51.456
You're not spies for
the McColts are Yeah?

04:51.458 --> 04:54.760
I am Twilight Sparkle, the
Princess of Friendship.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.562
And I am here to solve
your friendship problem.

04:57.564 --> 05:01.500
I'm Fluttershy. And
um, I'm here, too.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.637
Pleased to meet you, but
you're wasting your time.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.373
We don't have a
friendship problem;

05:08.375 --> 05:12.477
we have a McColt problem.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.713
And there's absolutely
no friendship there.

05:17.784 --> 05:21.386
Well, maybe there could be if we
figure out what the McColts did

05:21.388 --> 05:22.788
to make you so mad.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.424
Oh, well they've
done so many things!

05:25.426 --> 05:28.660
Why just today, they shot
pebbles at our farmhouse

05:28.662 --> 05:31.330
and wrecked it!

05:31.332 --> 05:33.398
See, we're not very
good at building

05:33.400 --> 05:36.835
so all it took was a
little pebble. But still.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.538
â™ª

05:39.540 --> 05:43.442
[squeaks]

05:43.444 --> 05:44.509
Oh, no!

05:48.081 --> 05:50.582
I know what to do. We're
gonna talk with these McColts

05:50.584 --> 05:52.384
and hear their
side of the story.

05:52.386 --> 05:56.722
we can put an end to this,
using reason and rationale.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.923
Good plan!

05:59.425 --> 06:02.094
That's why she's the Princess.

06:02.096 --> 06:05.697
In the meantime, could you
please call off the pumpkining?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.799
Oh, all right.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.502
Thanks. Come on, Fluttershy.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.473
[knock knock]

06:14.475 --> 06:16.708
State your business.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.443
Don't even bother.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.680
They're probably spies
for the Hooffields.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.484
Hey wait, you're an Alicorn.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.487
I thought just the three
princesses were Alicorns.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.690
There are four Alicorn
princesses in Equestria now.

06:31.692 --> 06:35.727
I am Twilight Sparkle, The
Princess of Friendship!

06:35.729 --> 06:37.929
And I'm Fluttershy.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.400
We have a new princess?
When did that happen?

06:41.402 --> 06:45.637
And, and how did the Hooffields
come by a princess spy?

06:45.639 --> 06:49.508
We are not spies! Why does
everypony assume we're spies?

06:49.510 --> 06:53.912
[rattling wood]

06:53.914 --> 06:59.851
Because we don't get a lot of
visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.487
You caught us at a weird time.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.589
We're in the middle
of a giant feud

07:04.591 --> 07:06.958
with our terrible neighbors!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.760
[echo]

07:08.762 --> 07:10.529
[crash]

07:10.531 --> 07:12.697
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.467
To solve your problem
with the Hooffields.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.736
So you're here to help
us get rid of them?

07:17.738 --> 07:21.173
[whooping cheers]

07:21.175 --> 07:24.209
No, that's not what
I meant at all!

07:24.211 --> 07:29.815
Well, if you ain't for
us, you're against us.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.854
<i>Twilight: We are not</i>
<i>on anypony's side.</i>

07:35.856 --> 07:38.056
We're here to help you
become friends again.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.593
Well, that's gonna be hard.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.697
I don't believe we've ever been
friends with the Hooffields.

07:45.699 --> 07:49.201
They're just really upset
you ruined their farmhouse--

07:49.203 --> 07:52.604
Wait a hog-wogglin'
minute! We only did that

07:52.606 --> 07:56.741
because the Hooffields pulled
the pin out of our wagon wheel.

07:57.544 --> 08:01.847
A whole week's worth of food
rollin' down the mountain!

08:01.849 --> 08:04.649
Us McColts are
mighty fine builders

08:04.651 --> 08:07.853
but we don't know the
first thing about farming.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.690
We have to travel a ways
away to buy our food.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.526
And now, we'll be stuck
eating the pumpkins

08:14.528 --> 08:16.795
the Hooffields launched at us!

08:16.797 --> 08:20.999
Pumpkin bread, pumpkin
soup, pumpkin quesadillas,

08:21.001 --> 08:27.873
pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese,
pumpkin pie, pumpkin fri-ta-tas.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.510
Actually that all sounds
pretty good, but it'll get old.

08:31.512 --> 08:38.583
â™ª

08:46.726 --> 08:48.960
Have you tried meeting
at a neutral location,

08:48.962 --> 08:52.864
talking about your problems, and
really listening to each other?

08:52.866 --> 08:56.868
What? No. They'd sooner
launch their dinners at us

08:56.870 --> 08:58.770
than listen to us.

08:58.772 --> 09:02.774
Well, they'll listen to me.
I'm an impartial third party.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.712
â™ª

09:07.714 --> 09:10.549
[amplified] Attention,
Hooffields and McColts!

09:10.551 --> 09:14.753
I'm not on anypony's side, but I
can see you're both wasting time

09:14.755 --> 09:17.322
and resources on being
mean to each other.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.025
Ponies are supposed to help
each other and be kind.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.595
So, let's stop this
senseless fighting.

09:25.998 --> 09:29.568
There. That should do it.
Ready to go home, Fluttershy?

09:29.570 --> 09:32.904
I'd love to, but if we've
solved the problem already,

09:32.906 --> 09:35.907
shouldn't our cutie
marks be glowing again?

09:35.909 --> 09:40.111
Oh, yeah. They should be
glowing any minute now.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.882
[splat]

09:47.787 --> 09:48.687
Or not.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.654
[splat]

09:49.656 --> 09:54.993
[panicked shouts]

09:54.995 --> 09:58.930
So much for potential friendship
solution number twenty-eight.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.600
I guess we should find
out why the Hooffields

10:01.602 --> 10:03.101
are launching tomatoes now.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.873
One at a time, Greenhoof.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.943
If you smush them
tomaters in the slingshot,

10:11.945 --> 10:14.913
they won't break on the McColts!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.983
What are you doing? I
asked you to stop fighting!

10:17.985 --> 10:20.619
Oh, is that what you
were hollerin' about?

10:20.621 --> 10:23.088
We thought the McColts
rubbed you the wrong way,

10:23.090 --> 10:26.358
so we tomatered them
for ya. My mistake.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.794
Stop the tomater slingshots!

10:33.966 --> 10:35.700
[thud]

10:35.702 --> 10:37.936
Reload the tomater slingshots!

10:37.938 --> 10:41.239
We're gonna paint
their mountaintop red!

10:43.743 --> 10:47.379
Well, that didn't work.
I was so sure it would.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.714
â™ª

10:49.716 --> 10:53.985
[crashes]

10:53.987 --> 10:55.186
[galloping hooves]

10:56.122 --> 10:57.188
[gasp]

10:57.190 --> 11:02.394
It was a good plan, but we
need to think of another one.

11:02.396 --> 11:06.865
This fight is really affecting
the animals around here.

11:08.834 --> 11:14.105
Not to worry. I'll just...find
the root of the problem

11:14.107 --> 11:15.907
and work from there!

11:19.145 --> 11:21.946
Pardon us, Ma, but do you
remember what started

11:21.948 --> 11:24.449
this whole feud in
the first place?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.051
They know what they did.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.821
They know what they did.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.690
I'm starting to think
neither of you know

11:31.692 --> 11:33.725
what either of you have done.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.429
Sure we do. Them Hooffields
did us a grave injustice

11:37.431 --> 11:39.898
some time ago for some reason.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.900
Hear, hear!

11:41.902 --> 11:45.103
O-kay, backup plan
to the backup plan.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.740
Maybe we can find some common
ground that you can bond over.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.742
What do you do when
you're not fighting?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.445
That's easy. Getting
ready to fight.

11:53.447 --> 11:56.448
What do you hope to
get out of fighting?

11:56.450 --> 11:58.717
The satisfaction of winning.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.053
Of winning what?

12:02.055 --> 12:06.758
The fight, of course. To
prove our family is the best!

12:06.760 --> 12:08.460
The best at what?

12:08.462 --> 12:11.196
Winning! Haven't
you been listenin'?

12:11.198 --> 12:14.065
So the only thing they have in
common is that they both want

12:14.067 --> 12:16.835
to win a fight and neither
of them know what it's over.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.738
How can I end this feud if I
don't know what it's about?

12:19.740 --> 12:23.742
Ooh. Maybe somepony just
needs to say they're sorry.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.110
That's a good idea.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.747
And friendship solution
#48, but we can move it up.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.183
I'm so glad you
agreed to do this!

12:32.185 --> 12:34.018
This apology cake
will go a long way

12:34.020 --> 12:36.254
to making amends
between you two.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.089
Which part of my argument
changed your mind?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.091
The part where I said the
benefits of friendship

12:40.093 --> 12:42.527
outweigh the cost of war?
Or the part where I said

12:42.529 --> 12:45.096
forgiveness is an
investment in happiness?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.931
Yeah, yeah, all of it.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.033
Wait, are you even
listening to me?

12:50.536 --> 12:52.237
Who goes there?

12:52.239 --> 12:54.239
It's Ma Hooffield--

12:54.241 --> 12:57.008
Hooffield alert! Arm the canons!

12:58.310 --> 13:02.213
--with an apology cake.

13:02.215 --> 13:07.986
Did you say...cake? As in, cake?

13:07.988 --> 13:13.892
Consider it a gesture of
good will, from us to you.

13:13.894 --> 13:18.163
I haven't had cake in ages.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.831
Open the gates!

13:27.006 --> 13:30.175
It's such a beautiful cake.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.277
Think of this as more
than just a cake.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.246
It's the first step in the
long road to forgiveness.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.016
Nothing says let's be friends
like a cake that says

13:38.018 --> 13:39.918
"let's be friends".

13:39.920 --> 13:41.920
I wrote that in
icing on the top.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.157
For glory!

13:46.159 --> 13:48.560
â™ª

13:48.562 --> 13:50.328
[scream]

13:50.330 --> 13:54.365
McColts! Assume delta
force formation!

13:56.602 --> 14:01.940
[battle cries]

14:01.942 --> 14:02.941
Ready?

14:04.176 --> 14:05.210
Aim!

14:06.579 --> 14:07.879
Fire!

14:16.922 --> 14:20.325
Ma Hooffield! You planted
ponies in that cake?

14:20.327 --> 14:25.330
Yeah. Wait, were you
serious about apologizing?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.632
Why in Equestria
would we do that?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.068
We didn't do anything wrong!

14:30.070 --> 14:32.370
What are you talkin' about?

14:32.372 --> 14:35.139
You've done so
many things wrong!

14:35.141 --> 14:37.976
Not as many as you!

14:39.211 --> 14:40.645
Take that, Hooffields!

14:40.647 --> 14:42.413
You started it!

14:42.415 --> 14:43.414
No, you did!

14:43.416 --> 14:45.383
[shouting continues]

14:50.623 --> 14:57.896
[angry shouting]

15:04.637 --> 15:07.338
If you could just
not yell so much,

15:07.340 --> 15:09.641
or maybe stop saying
words altogether...

15:09.643 --> 15:14.012
[screaming]

15:14.014 --> 15:15.013
Agh!

15:15.015 --> 15:16.080
Twilight?

15:21.153 --> 15:27.992
<i>â™ª [sad music] </i>

15:27.994 --> 15:32.664
Um, Twilight? We should
probably get back there.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.666
I mean, if you need
a break, that's fine

15:34.668 --> 15:37.468
but I really can't
do this without you.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.971
I don't know if we
can do this at all.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.406
Even if I make things right,

15:41.408 --> 15:43.441
they're just going
to fight again.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.011
[chittering]

15:47.013 --> 15:51.316
Hey, little fellas. That's
OK. You can come out.

15:51.318 --> 15:57.288
[chirping and chittering]

15:57.290 --> 15:58.690
[growl]

15:58.692 --> 16:00.091
What was that?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.559
[growling tummies]

16:04.229 --> 16:08.700
Oh, you poor things! There
isn't enough food here for you.

16:08.702 --> 16:13.471
Brr! And you're freezing! I'm
gonna take you all home with me

16:13.473 --> 16:17.075
and get you all hot cocoas. How
do you feel about book clubs?

16:17.077 --> 16:20.244
This was supposed to be
the most beautiful valley

16:20.246 --> 16:23.448
in all of Equestria.
What happened?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.216
[chittering]

16:25.218 --> 16:26.317
What's that?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.719
Oh.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.354
Uh huh.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.056
Twilight! They know what
happened here!

16:32.058 --> 16:33.725
What?

16:33.727 --> 16:38.329
[shouts]

16:38.331 --> 16:41.199
Stop! You have to listen to me!

16:41.201 --> 16:44.168
[splat]

16:44.170 --> 16:46.237
EVERYPONY FREEZE!

16:46.239 --> 16:47.205
[echo]

16:47.207 --> 16:48.506
[whoosh]

16:48.508 --> 16:52.010
[silence]

16:52.012 --> 16:55.213
Fluttershy, you
have to tell them!

16:55.215 --> 16:57.749
It's a lot harder to
freeze an army of ponies

16:57.751 --> 16:59.484
than just six of them.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.252
[straining]

17:03.522 --> 17:08.026
Before you keep fighting, there
is something you should know.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.195
Long ago, there were
two best friends...

17:11.197 --> 17:13.765
...Grub Hooffield
and Piles McColt.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.334
When they found the valley
between the Smokey Mountains,

17:16.336 --> 17:19.237
they knew it was
something special.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.407
So they made a promise to each
other to protect and preserve

17:22.409 --> 17:26.210
the valley for all its
adorable furry inhabitants.

17:26.212 --> 17:30.415
But, they disagreed
on how to go about it.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.517
Grub wanted to start
by planting crops

17:32.519 --> 17:35.253
so that everypony would
have something to eat.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.288
But Piles thought it
would be better to start

17:37.290 --> 17:41.592
by building a shelter to protect
them against the cold and wind.

17:41.594 --> 17:45.229
The two ponies were unable
to come to an understanding.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.799
So Piles went ahead and
built a shelter anyway,

17:47.801 --> 17:50.435
exactly where Grub was
going to start his farm.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.137
â™ª

17:53.139 --> 17:57.208
Grub was upset, so he
tore down Piles' shelter

17:57.210 --> 18:00.111
so he could plant his crops.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.513
They kept fighting,
back and forth,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.615
until it turned into a feud.

18:04.617 --> 18:11.689
â™ª

18:21.567 --> 18:24.836
The valley suffered from
the constant destruction

18:24.838 --> 18:27.505
until finally the
Hooffields and McColts moved

18:27.507 --> 18:30.308
to separate mountains.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.312
Even then, the valley and
all the animals in it

18:34.314 --> 18:37.448
continued to be caught
in the crossfire.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.319
You see, by fighting, you're
destroying the very thing

18:41.321 --> 18:43.654
that brought you here
in the first place.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.524
So it's time you both put
your differences aside

18:46.526 --> 18:49.660
and come together, if
not for yourselves,

18:49.662 --> 18:53.631
then for the sake of these
cute and cuddly guys.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.666
[grunts]

18:57.369 --> 19:02.306
Aw, shucks. We never meant
to hurt you little critters.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.876
Yeah, we're sorry.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.246
[chitter]

19:08.248 --> 19:11.215
They say they
accept your apology!

19:13.285 --> 19:17.221
Um, Princess? You
can unfreeze us now.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.523
[grunt]

19:18.525 --> 19:20.291
Oh, right.

19:23.662 --> 19:28.699
Ma Hooffield? We promise we
won't fight you no more.

19:28.701 --> 19:33.404
Us too. Except we
promise not to fight you.

19:33.406 --> 19:37.642
I suppose it doesn't matter
who's right. We're both wrong.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.711
That's one thing
we can agree on.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.313
[spit]

19:45.450 --> 19:47.518
This is wonderful!

19:47.520 --> 19:50.254
I am so proud of you two.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.523
Thanks, Princess.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.193
Though I would just
like to point out

19:55.195 --> 19:59.497
that I was the first
to admit I was wrong.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.233
That may be, but I promised
not to fight first.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.501
That counts for more.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.635
Oh, yeah?

20:04.637 --> 20:11.242
[urgent chirping & chittering]

20:11.244 --> 20:13.945
Oh, all right. We don't
have to speak animal

20:13.947 --> 20:16.948
to know what y'all
are sayin'. Truce?

20:16.950 --> 20:18.382
Truce.

20:20.619 --> 20:27.692
â™ª

20:35.400 --> 20:39.303
Hoo-wee, ain't that
a pretty sight!

20:39.305 --> 20:41.539
Sure is.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.442
The McColts are going to
help us rebuild our homes --

20:44.444 --> 20:46.410
good ones this time.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.714
And the Hooffields are going
to help us grow some crops.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.582
Not pumpkins!

20:51.584 --> 20:55.319
Thanks for teaching us that
friendship is so much better

20:55.321 --> 20:57.588
than winning a silly argument.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.463
Yay! I told you
we'd figure it out.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.500
We did. And we didn't need my
friendship portfolio to do it.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.002
We just needed each other.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.503
[poof]

21:12.505 --> 21:14.505
So what do you think
will happen next?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.741
We've all been called
by the map now.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.344
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get home.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.813
What if it summons all six
of us to another place?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.749
Or another pony we
weren't expecting? [gasp]

21:24.751 --> 21:27.518
What if it wants us to solve
other kinds of problems like

21:27.520 --> 21:31.389
quantum physics or why the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree?
