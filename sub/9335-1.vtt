<i>"I lost no time, of course, in
telling my mother all that I knew...</i>

00:24.500 --> 00:28.430
<i>"and we saw ourselves at once in
a difficult and dangerous position.</i>

00:28.500 --> 00:31.730
<i>"Something must speedily be resolved
upon, and it occurred to us...</i>

00:31.790 --> 00:33.390
"at last to go forth together...

00:33.450 --> 00:35.400
"and seek help
in the neighboring hamlet.

00:35.990 --> 00:39.110
"No sooner said than done.
Bare-headed as we were...

00:39.310 --> 00:43.090
"we ran out at once in the gathering
evening and the frosty fog.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.770
"The hamlet lay not many
hundred yards away...

00:45.850 --> 00:48.710
<i>"though out of view, on the other
side of the next cove...</i>

00:48.790 --> 00:50.510
<i>"and what greatly encouraged me...</i>

00:50.580 --> 00:52.140
"it was in an opposite direction...

00:52.220 --> 00:55.210
"from that whence the blind man
had made his appearance.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.490
"And I shall never forget
how much I was cheered...

00:57.560 --> 01:00.370
"to see the yellow shine in doors
and windows...

01:00.440 --> 01:01.480
<i>"but that, as it proved...</i>

01:01.560 --> 01:04.860
<i>"was the best of the help we were
likely to get in that quarter.</i>

01:04.910 --> 01:06.230
<i>"For you would have thought...</i>

01:06.300 --> 01:08.150
<i>"men would have been
ashamed of themselves...</i>

01:08.210 --> 01:11.280
<i>"no soul would consent
to return with us to the..."</i>

01:32.060 --> 01:33.520
Audrey? Sorry.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.460
Mr. Talcott's gone.

01:38.690 --> 01:39.630
Okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.340
Front desk, in case anyone shows.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.000
I think you'll be waiting
a while, hon.

02:08.259 --> 02:11.000
No. Didn't we call? He said he had family.

02:11.070 --> 02:12.060
Yeah.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.220
But they don't wanna have anything
to do with him.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.240
You can dump it out back.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.770
Okay, take a look.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.060
I interview tomorrow.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.240
What about your job?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.690
I had enough of that place.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.510
What happened?
Here's your beer.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.820
- Thanks.
- Sure.

03:40.490 --> 03:43.270
I lost a patient today. Mr. Talcott.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.450
- I'm sorry.
- You should have seen it.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.950
The second he died, it was like...

03:47.020 --> 03:48.580
they couldn't wait to get him out of there.

03:48.650 --> 03:49.860
It's just a business to them.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.620
It is a business, but at least he had you.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.000
No. It's supposed to be
a business about caring.

03:54.060 --> 03:55.140
They couldn't care less.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.070
Wait. This is Terrebonne Parish.
It's the freaking swamps.

04:01.010 --> 04:04.490
I get the hours I need to start
nursing school, and I get paid.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.560
And I get to help somebody, my way.

04:07.690 --> 04:10.960
They got gators in the swamps,
and guys missing teeth.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.350
Are we dancing here, or what?

04:14.480 --> 04:15.820
Cary, look.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.670
This work you're doing,
are you sure it's not changing you?

04:18.730 --> 04:21.320
I'm 25 years old.
What's wrong with a little change?

05:50.390 --> 05:51.740
Oh, my God.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.250
Hello?

06:29.030 --> 06:30.170
Hello?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.630
Now that right there
is what love is all about.

07:26.690 --> 07:29.510
Old-fashioned devotion,
like what you read about.

07:29.870 --> 07:31.360
You must be Caroline.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.050
I'm sorry, the door was open,
so I just walked in.

07:34.130 --> 07:36.580
Oh, no. It's a big house. I didn't hear you.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.130
It's okay.

07:41.070 --> 07:43.530
So much for getting their affairs in order.

07:44.270 --> 07:47.840
I'm sorry. I'm Luke Marshall. Estate lawyer.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.690
We talked on the phone.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.050
Oh, right.

07:52.330 --> 07:55.430
The docs figure a month maybe.
He's pretty far gone.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.550
I understand.

07:56.620 --> 07:59.690
His wife's having kind of
a rough time with it.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.550
Most people do.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.560
Violet, you have a visitor.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.360
May I present Miss Caroline Ellis?

08:12.440 --> 08:14.060
She works down at the hospice
in New Orleans.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.100
Caroline, this is Violet Devereaux.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.470
You have a lovely home.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.710
I'm sorry. It's just hard.
The idea of a stranger living here...

08:28.790 --> 08:30.090
I understand, really.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.230
She's Old South, you know.
She thinks women still curtsey.

08:36.409 --> 08:38.340
So, he can't talk at all?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.039
No. Stroke pretty much paralyzed him.

08:41.110 --> 08:43.340
- Which side was affected?
- Both.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.890
It happened about a month ago,
up in the attic.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.070
That's where she found him.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.190
Ben?

08:51.540 --> 08:54.410
You have a visitor. Meet Miss Caroline Ellis.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.230
Hello, Ben. I'm Caroline.

08:59.090 --> 09:02.500
She's not from around here.
She not gonna understand my house.

09:02.580 --> 09:03.720
She's from New Orleans.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.800
She wasn't raised in New Orleans.
You hear how she talks?

09:07.160 --> 09:10.230
Who knows where she comes from?
Hoboken, New Jersey.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.200
What do you want a Southern accent?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.380
The last one left, Violet.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.170
All right.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.140
But she's not gonna understand the house.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.430
The last girl left, huh?

09:23.510 --> 09:25.940
Wait. Let me talk to her,
we can straighten things out.

09:26.010 --> 09:28.050
I can't help anybody
who doesn't want my help.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.200
She does want help. She's just scared.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.790
Of what? Politeness?

09:31.870 --> 09:34.000
No. He's the love of her life and he's dying.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.570
They've been together forever.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.300
She's losing her soul mate here.

09:37.370 --> 09:39.890
I don't know about you, but that'd
put some sandpaper up my ass.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.750
Aren't you a romantic?

09:43.710 --> 09:44.760
Look.

09:44.890 --> 09:46.170
The last girl quit.

09:46.230 --> 09:48.340
You're the fifth interview since.
She shoots down everyone.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.380
It's not personal.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.630
But you being here means he's really dying.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.960
He's dying whether I'm here or not.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.110
What'd she mean about the house?

10:02.630 --> 10:03.630
What?

10:03.710 --> 10:07.420
She said I wouldn't understand
the house. Why'd she said that?

10:08.350 --> 10:10.590
All I know is her checks clear.

10:11.490 --> 10:13.050
Look, forget it.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.090
If it makes you feel any better, I'm
still looking for my dream job, too.

10:18.020 --> 10:18.970
All right.

10:20.610 --> 10:23.260
So if you talked to her, what would you say?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.940
I'd say she could look all she wants...

10:27.010 --> 10:29.350
but I doubt she'd find any better than you.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.310
So she'd do well to treat you like it.

10:34.090 --> 10:37.120
Okay, here are my rules. No knitting.

10:38.140 --> 10:40.090
No joining a bridge club.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.910
And no playing bingo.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.220
Okay, good. Good rules.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.750
I'm serious, they'll try and suck
you into their elderly ways.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.050
It's less than an hour away.
I'll be back all the time.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.580
Yeah, well, you better.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.720
Whenever you want to talk to someone
who wasn't around for World War II.

10:54.790 --> 10:57.030
Jeez, what is it with you and old people?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.050
Come here.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.410
He'd be proud of you. You know he would.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.340
Hello?

11:35.270 --> 11:37.320
I need to pay for some gas.

11:44.110 --> 11:45.220
Hello?

12:05.230 --> 12:07.090
Is somebody back there?

12:23.130 --> 12:24.430
I'm sorry.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.110
Excuse me. I just need to pay for some gas.

12:41.940 --> 12:42.950
Jesus.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.880
$17 for the gas.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.040
Keep the change.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.500
Mrs. Devereaux?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.190
I'm unpacked.

14:13.630 --> 14:16.060
Hi, Ben. Remember me? I'm Caroline.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.810
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

14:25.150 --> 14:28.060
There's not a lot of light in here
for you, is there?

14:31.170 --> 14:33.560
So you're a fan of the blues, huh?
Well, so was...

14:35.040 --> 14:36.740
You have to let go.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.070
Ben, you're hurting me.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.150
Ouch.

14:40.230 --> 14:41.660
There you are.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.560
Time for his remedies.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.980
Scoot over, child.

14:46.890 --> 14:49.270
9:00 in the morning and 7:00 at night.

14:49.350 --> 14:52.610
He takes his pills in powder form.
I'll show you how.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.650
Be sure he drinks it all down.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.450
What's he taking?
Oh, Coumadin and such.

14:57.610 --> 15:00.960
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.770
And a kiss to make it taste better.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.670
You're scrawnier than I'd hoped.
Prettier, though.

15:10.830 --> 15:13.380
I bet you're all marked up, aren't you?

15:14.020 --> 15:15.880
- Marked up?
- Written on.

15:16.170 --> 15:17.540
I know you young people are always...

15:17.610 --> 15:20.200
jabbing yourselves with ink and needles.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.180
You're written on, aren't you?

15:22.410 --> 15:24.240
Not where you can see.

15:24.330 --> 15:25.280
Well.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.710
He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

15:29.130 --> 15:32.740
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.490
How long have you two lived here?

15:37.960 --> 15:39.280
Let's see.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.990
We came over from Savannah in '62.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.720
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

15:46.830 --> 15:49.990
They'd inherited it a long time ago,
from their parents.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.490
Lived here since they were children.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.890
There they are. Martin and Grace.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.150
Charming people.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.330
But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.490
You keep their picture?

16:03.570 --> 16:07.240
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.690
All right. Come along now.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.170
This is the dining room.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.870
We only use about half of the rooms.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.110
The others are for Ben's antique business.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.930
What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

16:38.990 --> 16:40.900
Except for the attic.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.050
That has crystal and china.

16:43.130 --> 16:46.640
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.170
There are more than 30 rooms in all.

16:52.370 --> 16:55.790
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

16:55.870 --> 16:58.930
For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.800
This will open every door.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.020
This one is yours.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.619
I have mine.

17:07.990 --> 17:09.780
Now, the pantry's right out here.

17:09.849 --> 17:13.490
You know, we may have to ask you
to go into town now and then.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.410
Was there a mirror here once?

17:17.819 --> 17:20.369
I noticed in the bathrooms also
there are no mirrors.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.440
Child, when you get as worn-out
and wrinkled as we are...

17:23.520 --> 17:25.210
you don't need any reminding.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.319
If you want a small one
for your own purposes...

17:27.380 --> 17:28.440
that's fine with me.

17:28.510 --> 17:31.220
- What'd you do with them?
- Put them away.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.070
The boy tells me you don't smoke.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.160
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.670
I trust that won't be an issue.

17:43.740 --> 17:44.730
It won't be.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.220
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that...

17:47.300 --> 17:49.370
I'll live here as if you're not in residence.

17:49.430 --> 17:52.750
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

17:53.910 --> 17:58.170
My mom left when I was little. My
dad raised me and he died last year.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.560
Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

18:03.070 --> 18:04.500
I would have.

18:04.770 --> 18:07.010
I just thought I had more time.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.060
Yeah.

18:12.030 --> 18:15.130
You think too much about the time
you have left...

18:15.650 --> 18:17.620
you don't spend it living.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.790
Be good to my husband.
Be good to his house.

18:21.470 --> 18:22.790
Remedies at 9:00.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.890
One, two, three.

18:43.560 --> 18:47.230
You don't see gardens like this
back in New Jersey, I expect.

18:48.450 --> 18:50.730
Actually, it's the Garden State.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.180
I doubt that very much.

18:54.820 --> 18:57.280
Nothing more glorious than a garden.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.810
Gone every winter, back every spring.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.930
You religious at all?

19:06.050 --> 19:08.100
I try to keep an open mind.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.400
That's good. That's very good.

19:11.630 --> 19:13.290
Where are my trilliums?

19:13.350 --> 19:16.520
Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.720
Will you run up to the attic for me?

19:18.790 --> 19:22.370
I have some seed packets in a box
right next to the stairs.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.180
What took you?

22:10.300 --> 22:11.610
I'm sorry.

22:12.670 --> 22:15.100
I thought the key opens everything.

22:15.390 --> 22:17.370
The key? What key?

22:17.450 --> 22:19.330
The key you gave me for the house.

22:19.390 --> 22:21.670
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.340
Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

22:26.340 --> 22:28.890
- I got my Dixie-Johns.
- Why not?

22:29.950 --> 22:32.290
- What's in there?
- I have no idea.

22:32.930 --> 22:35.450
It's been shut ever since we moved in.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.330
I have to get these in the ground,
because there's rain coming.

22:39.430 --> 22:40.990
Mrs. Devereaux...

22:41.060 --> 22:44.480
Ben was in the attic, wasn't he,
when he had his stroke?

22:48.510 --> 22:50.560
What was he doing in there?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.930
You'll have to ask him, child.

22:54.060 --> 22:56.610
Be a dear and go see to him, won't you?

22:57.700 --> 22:59.840
I wonder if he wouldn't like some iced tea.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.550
His door was locked.

25:13.150 --> 25:14.190
Ben!

25:22.390 --> 25:23.670
Ben!

25:25.530 --> 25:26.740
Ben!

25:29.380 --> 25:32.750
Stop right there, Ben! Don't move!

25:40.220 --> 25:41.300
Stop!

25:42.790 --> 25:43.730
Ben!

25:47.420 --> 25:48.910
Mrs. Devereaux!

25:55.960 --> 25:56.980
Ben!

25:58.690 --> 26:00.990
Ben, what are you doing? It's me!

26:03.550 --> 26:05.370
Mother of mercy, what's he done?

26:05.440 --> 26:07.740
He got out of the window. I thought
you said he was bedridden.

26:07.810 --> 26:08.880
He's having spasms.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.520
- Didn't you give him his remedies?
- Yes.

26:10.590 --> 26:11.910
Did you make sure he drank them down?

26:11.970 --> 26:12.920
I thought so.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.170
- Ben, what'd they make you do?
- His door was locked.

26:15.230 --> 26:18.080
Just go get the wheelchair.
We've gotta get him out of this.

26:18.150 --> 26:19.220
What about a doctor?

26:19.300 --> 26:22.150
In the morning,
just get that wheelchair now.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.140
Caroline!

26:42.720 --> 26:43.810
Caroline!

26:45.960 --> 26:47.900
What in damnation took you so long?

26:47.970 --> 26:49.400
I came as fast as I could.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.680
We're just gonna have to double his
remedies. That's all I can think of.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.600
Caroline, help me here. Help me get him.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.000
Come on. That's it.

27:25.610 --> 27:28.040
Where did you think you were going?

27:35.250 --> 27:38.760
You're here two days and
he already tried to kill himself.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.060
Must have some kind of
bedside manner, huh?

27:42.190 --> 27:43.950
One of my many charms.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.260
So, what exactly happened?
I came to update her will...

27:49.100 --> 27:51.550
she's up with the doc, says he fell?

27:51.950 --> 27:53.330
He did fall.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.460
Like what, from his wheelchair?

28:01.170 --> 28:04.010
You cannot be serious. From
up there? He fell from up there?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.660
How? He can't even walk.

28:08.370 --> 28:11.880
Please don't tell me you're quitting.
I have to start over again.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.960
Will you shut the door?
I want to show you something.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.700
You know what my mama used to say?

28:19.060 --> 28:22.510
If a lady invites you into her room,
she probably isn't much of a lady.

28:22.580 --> 28:26.670
Homespun Southern wisdom grows
on trees around here, doesn't it?

28:27.060 --> 28:29.200
I found this in Ben's room...

28:29.360 --> 28:30.710
last night.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.400
Found what? His laundry?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.160
No, it had a...

28:34.230 --> 28:36.410
There was...
Had a what?

28:36.470 --> 28:38.510
There was a... It had a...

28:40.790 --> 28:42.100
Forget it.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.820
I thought it...

28:44.880 --> 28:46.960
I don't know what I thought.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.520
I admire you.

28:50.010 --> 28:51.860
You know, what you do.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.900
Hell, I wouldn't be able
to take care of my own parents.

28:54.970 --> 28:56.170
You'd regret it.

28:56.250 --> 28:59.250
I quit college to help out
with some friends' bands.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.430
Out all night, always on the road.

29:03.030 --> 29:06.010
My father thought
I was throwing my life away.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.530
So we didn't talk, didn't visit.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.680
Stubborn and proud,
and that's how we left it.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.920
You mean...

29:13.560 --> 29:14.640
Yeah.

29:16.510 --> 29:19.890
He was gone before
I even knew he was sick.

29:24.890 --> 29:27.710
I guess he wanted to spare me from all this.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.040
Is that so wrong?

29:32.120 --> 29:34.400
No one should have to die alone.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.970
So tell me what you were gonna tell me.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.660
About Ben.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.000
Do you ever feel like...

29:51.490 --> 29:53.430
he's asking you for help?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.670
- Asking me?
- With a look or...

29:56.670 --> 29:57.890
a touch.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.970
Mr. Marshall?

30:00.060 --> 30:03.200
Where in damnation is that boy? Caroline...

30:03.490 --> 30:05.560
have you seen Mr...

30:08.260 --> 30:09.440
Well...

30:10.310 --> 30:13.020
I see the children are getting acquainted.

30:13.830 --> 30:15.290
Now, Violet...

30:15.750 --> 30:17.690
you know you're the only woman in my life.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.020
I know no such things,
and remove your perspirations.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.230
The doctor has departed, so I'm ready...

30:24.290 --> 30:27.460
to discuss estate matters,
if you have finished...

30:27.530 --> 30:29.760
soliciting your new business.

30:39.110 --> 30:40.060
All right.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.980
Whenever you get the time.

33:38.910 --> 33:40.120
Caroline?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.350
I'm making some sweet tea.

33:44.410 --> 33:46.100
Are you interested?

33:50.470 --> 33:51.700
Caroline?

34:08.449 --> 34:09.820
"Sacrifice."

34:11.040 --> 34:12.800
Are you in the house?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.080
Caroline?

35:16.140 --> 35:18.050
You're forgetful, child.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.410
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

36:14.930 --> 36:16.530
<i>From the dry dust...</i>

36:16.720 --> 36:18.450
<i>out of these chains...</i>

36:18.770 --> 36:20.620
<i>from the devil's house.</i>

36:21.810 --> 36:23.410
<i>It is time, Lord...</i>

36:23.670 --> 36:24.940
<i>to take me...</i>

36:25.620 --> 36:29.490
<i>from the dry dust,
break me from these chains.</i>

36:30.010 --> 36:32.650
<i>Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

36:32.730 --> 36:35.210
<i>Take me out of darkness.</i>

36:36.150 --> 36:38.460
<i>Walk me out of blindness.</i>

36:38.520 --> 36:40.940
<i>Lift me out of sadness.</i>

36:41.140 --> 36:43.440
<i>Save me from my damned-ness.</i>

36:43.510 --> 36:44.940
<i>Please, Lord.</i>

36:46.100 --> 36:47.530
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

36:47.610 --> 36:51.120
<i>Take me from the dry dust. Break me...</i>

36:51.510 --> 36:56.020
<i>out of these chains.
Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

36:56.090 --> 36:57.910
<i>Take me out of...</i>

37:02.230 --> 37:03.860
Just a local band.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.590
How about you buy me a drink?

37:11.610 --> 37:14.420
Whatever it is, it's not your average attic.

37:14.490 --> 37:17.560
She says it's been locked up
ever since they first moved in.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.400
You found yourself a hoodoo room.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.850
- A what?
- Hoodoo. You know what hoodoo is?

37:28.700 --> 37:30.330
It's like voodoo, right?

37:30.780 --> 37:33.170
Wrong. Voodoo's a religion.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.640
Slaves brought it to Haiti from Africa.

37:35.710 --> 37:37.940
You worship God, heaven and hell.

37:38.010 --> 37:39.870
- How's hoodoo different?
- It's magic.

37:39.940 --> 37:43.100
American folk magic.
God doesn't have much to do with it.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.570
- Magic?
- Yeah.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.870
It's part African, part European,
part Native American.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.910
And New Orleans is its home.
It started here.

37:49.980 --> 37:53.210
My Aunt Nola's into it.
She shops at a place in Algiers.

37:54.430 --> 37:57.150
Look, you said the house
had a history, right?

37:57.210 --> 37:59.900
- Hoodoo is pretty harmless.
- Harmless how?

38:00.030 --> 38:02.140
It's psychological, like a lot of that stuff.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.280
It can't hurt you if you don't believe.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.640
So this place your aunt shops at...

38:08.960 --> 38:10.390
Ever seen it?

38:12.320 --> 38:15.620
It's either this street or the next one...

38:16.360 --> 38:17.910
or the next one.

38:20.420 --> 38:21.530
There.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.610
There? That's a Laundromat.

38:24.710 --> 38:27.680
Look, that's all I know.
That's where she goes.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.350
So you coming in or what?

38:32.870 --> 38:34.050
I'm not.

38:34.370 --> 38:35.930
I thought you don't believe in this stuff.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.090
I don't.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.950
But I'm not just going
to mess around with it.

38:39.010 --> 38:40.960
So, you wanna go in, go ahead.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.850
You're scared.

38:43.910 --> 38:46.560
- Jill the Thrill is scared.
- Kiss my ass.

38:46.630 --> 38:49.180
You're never gonna live this down.
We come all the way out here...

38:49.260 --> 38:50.750
I'm not scared.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.910
Good night, Caroline.

39:47.370 --> 39:48.720
Good night.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.160
I told you about the mirrors.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.180
I don't understand.

40:39.260 --> 40:40.880
This is not your house.

40:40.950 --> 40:43.280
I found them.
I needed a mirror for my bathroom...

40:43.480 --> 40:46.610
I told you, and you heard me. No mirrors.

40:47.830 --> 40:49.140
No mirrors!

40:52.980 --> 40:54.540
I've seen the room.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.280
- What room?
- The room you say you've never seen.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.730
It's not locked anymore.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.260
No, child, you don't know
what you've seen.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.270
You're gonna tell me right now.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.290
Or I'm leaving.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.510
You're not from the South.

41:23.390 --> 41:25.140
You won't understand.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.540
That room up there,
you just don't go in and...

41:28.600 --> 41:31.060
throw things out of a room like that.

41:31.770 --> 41:34.430
You leave them just where you found them.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.810
The house is theirs just as much as ours.

41:38.920 --> 41:43.190
The house is whose?
Whose things are in that room?

41:43.680 --> 41:44.960
All right.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.190
About 90 years ago...

41:49.280 --> 41:52.090
there was a banker here,
his name was Thorpe.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.940
He made his fortune cheating the poor.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.720
He was a mean man. He was a cruel man.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.990
It was him, and his family,
and couple of servants...

42:01.450 --> 42:05.220
name of Mama Cecile and Papa Justify.

42:06.410 --> 42:07.640
Sit down.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.660
Now...

42:09.410 --> 42:12.760
the way I heard it, old man Thorpe,
he didn't know...

42:13.570 --> 42:16.440
that Papa Justify was
a "two-headed doctor."

42:17.450 --> 42:20.960
He was a conjure man. So was Cecile.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.450
- They believed in...
- Hoodoo.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.800
Yeah.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.190
That was their room.

42:38.090 --> 42:40.710
<i>They were famous
all through the bayous.</i>

42:41.390 --> 42:44.200
<i>They healed the sick
and they hurt the mean.</i>

42:44.650 --> 42:48.360
"Hit a straight lick with a crooked
stick," as the coloreds say.

42:48.770 --> 42:52.520
But old Thorpe, he just saw them as help.

42:53.190 --> 42:55.430
And he worked them to the bone.

42:55.950 --> 42:57.440
He abused them.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.570
Until one night, as the story goes...

43:03.440 --> 43:04.420
there was a party.

43:07.210 --> 43:11.400
<i>It was the bank's anniversary,
all the big mucketymucks were here.</i>

43:11.490 --> 43:14.560
<i>Politicians, sugar barons, riverboat tycoons.</i>

43:15.250 --> 43:17.960
<i>There was a lot of drinking and dancing...</i>

43:18.830 --> 43:21.190
<i>and a couple of trysts, I'm sure.</i>

43:23.750 --> 43:26.760
<i>And then, finally,
when it was time to say farewell...</i>

43:26.830 --> 43:30.340
<i>some of the guests wanted
to wish goodbye to the children.</i>

43:30.410 --> 43:33.800
<i>But nobody could find them.
They hadn't seen them in hours.</i>

43:33.870 --> 43:36.450
<i>So, being all full of brandy,
they made it a game.</i>

43:36.530 --> 43:38.510
<i>"Let's Find the Children. "</i>

43:38.930 --> 43:41.000
<i>Room after room after room.</i>

43:41.870 --> 43:44.590
<i>Finally, someone heard music...</i>

43:44.650 --> 43:46.220
Martin? Grace?

43:46.280 --> 43:48.680
<i>... and voices and shouting...</i>

43:49.490 --> 43:50.960
<i>up in the attic.</i>

43:51.090 --> 43:52.550
<i>From the devil's house.</i>

43:54.030 --> 43:55.630
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

43:55.790 --> 43:58.580
<i>The servants were up there
with the children.</i>

43:58.640 --> 44:01.940
<i>They were trying to teach them
how to conjure hoodoo.</i>

44:02.000 --> 44:03.530
And take his head.

44:05.050 --> 44:08.580
<i>Thorpe went about insane,
and so did the rest of the guests.</i>

44:10.700 --> 44:13.430
<i>I mean, how long had this blasphemy
been going on?</i>

44:14.510 --> 44:18.200
<i>The children said it was their
fault, that they'd wanted to learn.</i>

44:18.700 --> 44:21.010
<i>But they weren't having any of that.</i>

44:42.300 --> 44:46.610
<i>All that power and rage and insanity.</i>

44:56.050 --> 44:57.590
<i>The party was over.</i>

45:10.560 --> 45:12.470
It was a terrible thing.

45:13.470 --> 45:14.710
Terrible.

45:18.720 --> 45:21.820
Rumors got out, but no arrests, no trial.

45:23.610 --> 45:25.240
Money had its way.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.270
What happened to the family?

45:30.330 --> 45:32.060
The bank went under.

45:32.350 --> 45:36.280
Thorpe shot his wife to death,
and then turned the gun on himself.

45:38.810 --> 45:42.500
People in the bayou say
it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

45:42.950 --> 45:45.500
The children stayed here till '62.

45:46.880 --> 45:51.030
But they never, ever, told us
why that room was locked.

45:52.670 --> 45:55.680
Or why there were no mirrors
in the whole house.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.460
Now we know.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.310
You know what?

46:03.650 --> 46:06.330
You see them in the mirrors.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.920
Who?

46:09.190 --> 46:10.430
The servants.

46:11.270 --> 46:14.080
I've gone and read
some hoodoo books, and they say...

46:14.270 --> 46:16.700
- putting brick dust down'll keep harm away.
- Mrs. Devereaux.

46:17.290 --> 46:20.070
So I made a big circle of it around
the whole house.

46:20.130 --> 46:23.810
You can't expect me to believe
you see ghosts in your mirrors.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.990
The ghosts are here now.

46:31.630 --> 46:33.860
But whatever they did to him...

46:34.570 --> 46:37.120
I am not going to let them do it to me.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.640
Now you'll leave...

46:47.170 --> 46:49.150
like all the rest of them.

47:47.090 --> 47:50.220
That's some superstitious wife
you got there, Ben.

47:50.670 --> 47:53.290
She thinks you have ghosts in the attic.

47:54.230 --> 47:55.510
Spooky, huh?

47:56.340 --> 47:57.290
Ouch.

47:58.900 --> 48:01.380
Hold on. I'll be right back.

48:17.460 --> 48:19.940
She says you see them in the mirrors.

48:21.490 --> 48:23.310
Ghosts in the mirrors.

48:58.230 --> 48:59.580
I'm sorry, Ben.

49:03.170 --> 49:04.590
Ben, stop it.

49:07.190 --> 49:09.620
Relax. I'm so...

49:10.430 --> 49:11.840
I'm so sorry.

49:14.140 --> 49:15.570
I'm so sorry.

49:17.790 --> 49:19.380
You see them, too.

49:28.570 --> 49:30.170
I'm going to town.

49:30.460 --> 49:31.640
Shopping.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.230
What for, Caroline?

49:36.960 --> 49:38.870
Caroline, what for?

49:39.080 --> 49:40.760
We'll just have to see.

50:22.980 --> 50:24.360
He won't beat you again.

50:24.580 --> 50:26.970
Mama Cynthia,
he beat me last night.

50:27.300 --> 50:30.170
You use the potion
that I'm gonna fix for you...

50:30.440 --> 50:32.830
and it won't happen again.
I will promise you that.

50:32.910 --> 50:35.290
I'm scared.
Don't be afraid.

50:35.470 --> 50:36.870
Are you sure that I can do it?

50:36.930 --> 50:38.430
I know it will. It will work.

50:38.510 --> 50:40.810
Just do as I say. Don't be afraid.

50:40.880 --> 50:43.460
It will work, and it won't happen again, ever.

50:43.690 --> 50:46.070
Don't worry about it. He won't hit you again.

50:46.530 --> 50:50.370
Just use this potion I mixed up.
I have a lot of things in here.

50:50.730 --> 50:52.550
And you use it as I told you.

50:52.620 --> 50:54.300
- Okay, I'll trust you, Mama.
- You'll do fine.

51:02.570 --> 51:05.670
That brick dust at the door,
how does it work?

51:06.280 --> 51:08.040
You lay a line down.

51:08.170 --> 51:11.520
Nobody that means you harm can cross it.

51:12.010 --> 51:14.500
It's how you tell who your enemies are.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.700
It's like hypnotism, right?

51:19.430 --> 51:20.650
Suggestion?

51:21.490 --> 51:24.970
And when this stuff works, it's
because someone believes it works?

51:26.450 --> 51:29.130
And if you thought, you know...

51:29.840 --> 51:31.630
magic made you sick...

51:32.460 --> 51:34.670
you might believe in a magic cure, right?

51:35.400 --> 51:37.200
Even though it's all in your head.

51:37.270 --> 51:38.860
Somebody been working roots on you.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.490
Say I knew someone
who believed he'd been...

51:41.840 --> 51:44.010
- Crossed.
- Crossed.

51:45.970 --> 51:48.310
Would he believe he could be uncrossed?

51:48.400 --> 51:50.250
What's the nature of his condition?

51:50.360 --> 51:52.910
He can't speak. Barely moves.
He had a stroke...

51:54.220 --> 51:56.530
but he seems to think
someone else made him that way.

51:56.590 --> 51:58.730
And you want to know
what happened to him?

51:58.840 --> 51:59.950
Yes.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.620
<i>You went in there.
You actually went in.</i>

52:14.670 --> 52:15.790
Are you out of your mind?

52:15.860 --> 52:18.580
Come on. Haven't you ever heard
of psychosomatic treatment?

52:18.640 --> 52:21.400
Yeah. But this is not that.

52:21.460 --> 52:25.230
How much of a patient's recovery
depends on his believing he can?

52:25.300 --> 52:27.210
What recovery? This is hospice.

52:27.290 --> 52:29.080
You're just supposed to help this guy die.

52:29.150 --> 52:30.670
He believes in this stuff.

52:30.740 --> 52:32.690
So what? Who is he to you?

52:32.860 --> 52:33.870
Forget it.

52:33.940 --> 52:36.660
No, you forget it. He's not your dad.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.290
Not this one, the last, or the one before.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.150
Why are the two of you so attached?

52:42.230 --> 52:43.930
I'm sorry, Cary.

52:43.990 --> 52:45.750
Just so you know,
if I'm not attached to him...

52:45.820 --> 52:47.160
I'm abandoning him.

52:48.190 --> 52:49.230
Attached is better.

52:49.340 --> 52:52.750
I know. Cary, I'm sorry. Okay?

52:53.120 --> 52:54.830
But would you look at yourself?

52:55.060 --> 52:58.000
You want to be a nurse and you
just walked out of a witch doctor's.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.500
It's not for me.

53:08.730 --> 53:11.010
<i>Forecasters are calling
for up to a foot of rain...</i>

53:11.070 --> 53:12.010
<i>in the coastal areas...</i>

53:12.090 --> 53:15.390
<i>as this storm makes its way across
the delta, starting overnight.</i>

53:15.460 --> 53:18.350
<i>Radar already shows
increasing precipitation...</i>

53:18.430 --> 53:21.360
<i>across the coastal areas and moving
rather quickly to the north.</i>

53:21.440 --> 53:24.160
<i>The main forecast concerns
centers around potential...</i>

53:29.110 --> 53:30.330
Hi, Ben.

53:33.250 --> 53:35.250
I'm gonna show you something.

53:37.410 --> 53:41.750
It's going to be our secret. You and me.

53:45.770 --> 53:48.510
Violet says you didn't have a stroke...

53:49.340 --> 53:52.480
in the attic. She said some ghosts...

53:52.740 --> 53:55.040
made you this way with a spell.

53:56.450 --> 53:58.270
Is that what you think?

53:59.490 --> 54:01.760
Because I know a spell, too, Ben.

54:03.420 --> 54:04.990
One that makes you better.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.850
All you have to do is believe it.

54:47.210 --> 54:48.490
Backwards.

54:52.330 --> 54:54.090
Cleanse this man.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.710
Cleanse this room.

54:57.740 --> 54:59.430
Cleanse this house.

55:04.170 --> 55:07.720
His words have gotten lost,
lost and wandering in his mind.

55:08.330 --> 55:10.240
Let the water run down...

55:11.050 --> 55:13.320
and wash away this condition.

55:17.330 --> 55:21.800
His tongue has gotten tied,
tied and tangled in his throat.

55:22.410 --> 55:24.320
Let the water run down...

55:25.620 --> 55:27.780
and wash away this affliction.

55:31.440 --> 55:34.440
Send his voice to go free.

55:35.570 --> 55:37.480
Let the water run down...

55:37.750 --> 55:38.820
and wash away...

55:52.940 --> 55:54.890
Caroline.

56:03.510 --> 56:05.330
Caroline.

56:07.440 --> 56:10.060
It's all in your head.

56:11.510 --> 56:13.610
Help. Help.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.060
Ben, talk to me. Keep talking.

56:18.130 --> 56:19.600
Help me.

56:21.210 --> 56:24.310
Help you? Help you how, Ben?

56:25.240 --> 56:27.790
Get me out of here.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.170
Caroline?

56:32.410 --> 56:34.870
Get me out of here!

56:36.440 --> 56:37.490
Shit!

56:37.560 --> 56:39.500
- Caroline!
- Just a second.

56:39.580 --> 56:41.490
Caroline, open this door!

56:42.550 --> 56:43.830
What are you doing to him?

56:43.890 --> 56:45.750
Ben, why? Get out of here, why?

56:45.970 --> 56:48.280
- Caroline!
- One second!

56:48.630 --> 56:49.810
Caroline, open this door!

56:49.880 --> 56:51.790
I'll help you, I promise. Just talk to me.

56:51.860 --> 56:55.100
What happened to you in that attic?
Tell me who you're afraid of.

56:57.850 --> 56:59.510
What have you done?

57:01.700 --> 57:03.380
What is this?

57:03.480 --> 57:04.660
He was...

57:04.830 --> 57:07.510
- He was struggling in his sleep...
- Get away from him.

57:07.580 --> 57:09.490
- Get away from him.
- He was struggling.

57:10.650 --> 57:11.900
It's all right.

57:12.570 --> 57:13.620
I brought water.

57:13.690 --> 57:15.000
You were talking to him?

57:15.070 --> 57:18.270
I was just telling him a story
to settle him down.

57:18.340 --> 57:20.730
- About what?
- Just a story.

57:23.550 --> 57:24.890
No ghosts.

57:26.400 --> 57:28.710
That'll be all tonight, Caroline. Thank you.

57:30.460 --> 57:31.770
I'll come back to check on him...

57:31.840 --> 57:35.640
No, that won't be necessary.
That's all for tonight. Good night.

58:05.510 --> 58:07.100
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

58:26.750 --> 58:28.220
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

58:29.670 --> 58:30.780
Grace.

58:30.860 --> 58:32.100
<i>Caroline?</i>

58:32.780 --> 58:34.020
Caroline.

59:16.880 --> 59:18.370
Mrs. Devereaux?

59:42.800 --> 59:45.140
Her and her ghost shit.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.360
<i>That attic is filled
with this stuff.</i>

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.570
Recipes. Spells. Books of them.
Records of them.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.900
I understand your cause of concern...

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.650
but my family is superstitious, too.
We're called Baptists.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.860
- This is different.
- It's charming.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.010
Local color.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.830
You said yourself
you were worried about him.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.750
Well, now I'm worried about you.
You know?

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.260
Are you a nurse or a detective?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.120
When did you first meet the Devereauxs?

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.130
Just before he had his stroke.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:39.310
They were looking for a lawyer
to update their wills.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:41.620
Did you ever think that
maybe she knew something...

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.000
was gonna happen to him?

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.250
How? Like tarot cards in the attic?
A séance in her sleep?

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.800
I want to know why the last girl quit.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.760
Hallie. Some folks to see you.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.500
<i>You a superstitious person?</i>

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.490
Not per se.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.500
I told my mama
where I was working.

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.190
She said that house has been
nothing but blood and tears.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.640
That the last owners were
some rich brother and sister.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.620
Crazy people, supposedly.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.220
They died of strokes
right after they sold the place.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.710
Maybe they found something they shouldn't.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.440
Maybe now Ben did, too.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.620
It may be their mess in that room...

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.060
but ain't no ghosts
put a spell on that old man.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.630
She did.

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:28.120
- Do you believe that?
- Don't you?

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.040
But I heard it can't hurt you.

01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.840
I mean, it can't hurt you if you don't believe.

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:36.410
Then I suggest you leave that house
before you do.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.010
For God's sake, this is insane.
The man had a stroke.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.310
That isn't what he thinks.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.680
And you're gonna take him away
from her? From his own wife?

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:50.070
- How can you believe...
- I don't believe. I don't.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.930
The point is, he does.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.890
Stop the car.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.450
- Stop the car.
- Why?

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:59.110
I've been here before.
I'll show you. It's not just them.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.090
See the line across the doorway?
It's brick dust.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.130
Hoodoo. Keeps your enemies
from coming across.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.280
See the bones hanging?

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.370
This stuff's got a hold on people out here.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.320
Yeah, but it's not real.

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.290
It doesn't matter if it's not real.
It's real to them.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.290
What's wrong?

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.420
This music. I know this music.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.010
You sure this is a good idea?

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.760
Hello?

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.830
Mama raised a gentleman.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:45.500
Hello?

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.780
Excuse me. Ma'am?

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.220
We heard the music, your record.
I was wondering...

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:55.660
There's no record for anyone here.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.130
How about records by a man named Justify?

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.950
How do you know that name?

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:09.220
Who sent you?

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.120
Who else is in here?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.930
- Someone else in here?
- It's just me, ma'am.

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.790
Stop now. Don't you go touching...

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.680
<i>Do you know a record called
the Conjure of Sacrifice?</i>

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.180
Because I have it, if you do.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.660
You had that, you wouldn't say so.

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.200
You do know it.

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:37.930
The strongest conjuration of all.
They say Justify discovered it...

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.290
but he got killed
before he learned to work it.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:46.220
Him and his poor wife both.
It's never been found.

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:48.140
What does it do?

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.100
It keeps you from dying.

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.230
Not forever, but for a while.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.080
How?

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.740
You have to sacrifice somebody...

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:00.680
and take the years that they have left.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.550
Hurry up! He's alone with her!

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.840
Hang on, Caroline! Wait! Shit!

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.070
Now you got me spooked.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.700
If I get proof that she's out
to hurt him, will you stick by me...

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.070
- By "hurt him," you mean kill him.
- Will you or won't you?

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.770
Just listen to yourself.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.880
Fine. Goodbye.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.390
What are you gonna do here,
kidnap him?

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:28.470
You know something's wrong
between them. You know it.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:30.840
Let me make some calls.
See about grounds for...

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.700
a restraining order, protective custody.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.840
You're not gonna get a search
warrant till tomorrow anyhow.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.500
Then that'll give me tonight.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.430
I'm all he's got, Luke. Me.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.960
Get the proof. Okay?

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.320
Mrs. Devereaux, I'm back.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.060
No. Where's the record?

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.780
It was right here.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.880
Mrs. Devereaux,
could you come here for a second?

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.000
Caroline, I was beginning to worry
about you...

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.500
you were gone such a long while.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.140
It's really raining out there.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.900
It's supposed to pour all night.

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.040
Keeps up like this,
that swamp's going to rise...

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.930
and ruin my flowerbeds.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.670
Did you want to see me?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.180
Yeah, I was wondering if
you could take a look at this?

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.590
There's a leak up here.

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:34.240
They're all over the house.
They're just rainwater.

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:38.530
Yes, but if you look up close...

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.860
Come on in. I could show it to you better.

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.240
Actually, I have supper on the stove.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.430
I shouldn't leave it.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:02.800
- It'll just take a second.
- I can see perfectly from here.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.290
You want this for the sill?

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.660
All right.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.240
Could you come into the room please,
just for a second?

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.150
So I can show you what I'm seeing.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.900
You're a funny one, Caroline.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.980
I'll make us some tea.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.210
And, Caroline?

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:37.960
After you've given Mr. Devereaux
his remedies...

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.030
would you be so kind
as to join an old lady for supper?

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.630
- Well, I...
- Wonderful!

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.300
We should have done it days ago.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:46.930
I've made something real nice.

01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:00.370
We're leaving tonight.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.900
Caroline!

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.870
Supper.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.500
How's your gumbo?

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.420
I haven't started.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.800
Would you like sugar for your tea?
I put it out for you.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.130
No, I don't think I'll have any sugar tonight.

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:45.200
But I thought you liked it.

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.080
You always have sugar in your tea.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.840
You think I'm senile, don't you?

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:53.840
Ghosts in the attic. Spells on my husband.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.830
I just don't understand.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.490
These ghosts, why would they put
a spell on him and not me?

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.180
I've been in that room, too.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.810
Maybe because you don't believe in them.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.100
Maybe all houses have spirits...

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.040
but we just don't see them
until we believe we can.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.670
I'm really not that hungry.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.970
Don't move. I'll fetch the candles.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.970
Eat your gumbo. Oh, fiddlesticks.

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:45.250
Dinner by candlelight.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.069
There.

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.790
So, was that the storm or the ghosts?

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.130
Well, say what you will about spirits.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200
I've always wondered
if there wasn't something...

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.800
we could learn from them.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.580
Like a spell?

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.720
I have great respect for your husband.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.660
And whatever he thinks
happened to him, he's fighting it.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.620
What did happen to him, Violet?

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.510
You haven't touched your gumbo.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.550
What have you done to him?

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.570
I made that special for you,
and you haven't even touched it.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.660
What have you done?

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.280
He is my husband, and I am his wife...

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.740
and I will do to him whatever I wish to do!

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.850
He's not safe in this house.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.750
What, what...

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.230
What is this?

01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:42.890
You've done something.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.510
He's not safe in this house. Not with you.

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.620
- This is my house.
- I'm taking him, Violet.

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:48.640
No!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.610
Too late. Not again.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.200
You little whore. He's mine.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.540
Keep him in this house.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.150
Keep him in this...

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.300
He's mine!

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.410
"Protection."

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:29.640
Where's the record?

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:39.720
Oh, God.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.890
Got it.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.330
You bitch.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.230
Time to go.

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:21.330
Come on, Ben.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.700
I'm going to get you out of here.
Just hold on.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.910
Damn it!

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.310
Keep him in this house.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.680
Hold on.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.770
Caroline?

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:28.920
Oh, shit!

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:45.220
Caroline.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.910
Come on, Ben!

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.040
We've got to hide you, Ben.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.420
I'm gonna get help. I won't leave you.

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.300
Okay?

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.620
Caroline?

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.550
You think you can take him
out of this house?

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.400
You think you're stronger than me?

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:47.650
You've no idea how strong I am, Caroline.

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:54.400
Caroline!

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:01.380
You're just making it harder on yourself!

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:04.610
Where are you?

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.220
You can't get away, Caroline.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:16.040
You understand me?

01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:19.020
You'll never get out of here, child.

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:21.640
Caroline?

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.770
Caroline!

01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:28.170
Stop right there!

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.460
Thank you.

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:27.060
Luke!

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.650
Jesus Christ.

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:34.100
She tried to kill me.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.950
She had a gun.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.640
She knows I know. Ben's in trouble.

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:43.320
He's still at the house.
Call the police, Luke. I left him.

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:45.180
We got to get back out there.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.590
The hell we do.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.250
I left him there.

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.990
You didn't leave anyone. Okay? Slow down.

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:55.130
Tell me what happened.
She tried to kill you?

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.140
Sorry.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.590
Mrs. Devereaux.

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.450
To what do I owe the...

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:07.260
Heard from Caroline? Why would she have...

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.140
What's going on?

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.450
Okay. What happened tonight?

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.590
Hang on a second.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.710
We need to record this.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.460
Hurting him? Hurting him how?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.230
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:35.230
I am listening to you.

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:43.630
Good night, child.

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.580
A hell of a thing, isn't it?

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.280
See, everywhere you look...

01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:14.470
it's a whole new world all around you.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.940
It's like being born.

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:20.270
Or dying. Of course, I wouldn't know.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.150
Hush, darling. I know it's hard.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.850
We're home!

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.530
He's missing. She's hidden him somewhere.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.290
Where is he, Caroline?

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.450
It's not him, it's me.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.900
You want to sacrifice me.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.700
Where is he, Caroline?

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.650
Why are you helping her?

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.850
- Is everything ready?
- No.

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:12.150
I can't start anything till I know where he is.

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.290
What's our tale if he gets away?

01:20:15.130 --> 01:20:16.630
Caroline...

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:19.860
you will tell me exactly
where my husband is.

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:24.110
There's nothing anybody can do
for him, so there's no need to try.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.360
Where is he?

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.790
Where is he, Caroline?

01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:36.180
He's in the garden shed.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:43.280
Don't scratch her up any more
than she already is.

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.400
She's teaching you.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.920
You help her kill me,
and she'll teach you how.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.940
Ben knew, too, didn't he?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.450
That's enough, Caroline.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.860
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.960
Stop right there, Caroline!

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.290
I want my father's picture.

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:14.360
I want it with me.

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.320
Please.

01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:32.600
Jesus. All right.

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:35.740
You want your picture,
I'll get your goddamn picture.

01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:58.460
Fuck!

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.230
Violet, she's going outside!

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.320
Violet!

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.610
She's here!

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.620
Quick! Go get her! Help me!

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.550
Come on.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.310
She's fixed the door!

01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:02.990
Violet, I can't get up the stairs!

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.150
You try to use my tricks on me?

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.190
On me, huh?

01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:54.030
No!

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.350
<i>911 emergency.</i>

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.560
My name is Caroline Ellis.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.740
I'm at 1750...

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:33.750
Bayou Chapelet in Terrebonne Parish.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.930
I need police and paramedics.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.520
There are people hurt here. We're trapped.

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:40.190
Please hurry.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.150
<i>- What time is it?
- Jill.</i>

01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:50.110
<i>- Jill.
- Cary?</i>

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.540
Jill, I'm in trouble.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:52.790
Caroline?

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.010
It's real.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.010
<i>- It's all real.
- You're where? What?</i>

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:59.230
I'm in the Devereaux house.

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:02.160
<i>What's real? What...</i>

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.470
Jill?

01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:13.620
Caroline!

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.980
You can't get away, Caroline.

01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:27.330
Oh, God, no.

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.470
Caroline.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.670
"Chalk, sulfur, blood, hair."

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:52.960
Sulfur.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:56.670
Candle.

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.080
Chalk.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.190
Hurry!

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.160
Circle.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.890
Eyes.

01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:26.270
Four eyes. North, south.

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:29.420
Hurry! Oh, God, please.

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.370
What's next?

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.490
Hair.

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:47.690
My child...

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.570
I believe you broke my legs.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.920
You can't touch me.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:00.140
You can't get near me. See this?
This is your spell of protection.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.570
Is that what that is now?

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.540
And who exactly gave you that spell?

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.700
All that circle protects is you...

01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:12.070
from leaving it.

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:20.000
You stay back!

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.020
I'll kill you! You stay away!

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.840
We've been waiting for you, Caroline.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.140
Waiting for you to believe.

01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:30.250
It doesn't work if you don't believe.

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.220
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:37.190
<i>From the dry dust out of these chains.</i>

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:38.510
I don't believe.

01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:41.860
I don't.

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:46.730
I think you do.

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:51.240
The weakness is the flesh.
The flesh, the flesh.

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.560
I don't believe.

01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:56.790
I don't...

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.340
I don't believe in it.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.950
The flesh. The coil.

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.130
I don't believe.

01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:15.440
The frail. The weak.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.430
I don't believe.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.530
I don't...

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:22.540
No.

01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:26.650
Oh, my God.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:33.460
I don't believe!

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:37.070
I don't believe!

01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.220
I don't believe!

01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:41.200
I don't believe!

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.180
Thank you, child.

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.060
Cecile?

01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:19.740
You all right?

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.180
I'm fine now, Justify.

01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:28.100
A fair bit harder than the lawyer,
wasn't she?

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.000
It's harder every time.

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:33.190
They just don't believe like they used to.

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:34.690
Got to get them riled up.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.730
I told you I wanted a black one this time.

01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:45.290
You know the black ones never stay.

01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:48.580
Beggars can't be choosers.

01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:51.720
I think it fits you beautifully.

01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:55.430
It's better than Violet, or Grace, even.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:00.610
We'll get used to it. We always do.

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:18.210
The thing folks don't understand
about sacrifice...

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.610
Get me out of here.

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:25.030
...sometimes it's more of a trade.

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:26.800
Get me out of here.

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:30.990
No!

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.920
There, there, Caroline.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.580
We thought it was just a fall, but
now she can't move or even speak.

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.410
Like a stroke or something.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.560
Cary?

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.000
Dearie me.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:59.890
You called me.

01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:01.400
I called you?

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.420
For help. Don't you remember?

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:10.290
Cary's not herself right now.
I'm Luke Marshall.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.070
- Devereauxs' lawyer.
- Hi. Jill Dupay, her roommate.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.560
Jill, yes, I did call you.

01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:19.350
Fiddlesticks.
I don't know what possessed me.

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.600
It's all right. I'm here.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.100
They need real care now.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:28.410
They can't stay here.

01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:30.200
This is all my fault.

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.960
No, Cary. No, it's not.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.010
It's not.

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.450
Someone should ride
to the hospital with them. Maybe...

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.670
Jill, would you mind? And we'll meet you.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.230
Of course. Whatever you need.

01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:05.910
She meant so much to them, her being here.

01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.080
I know it wasn't for long, but...

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:12.220
they really loved her.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.520
Why do you say that?

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.540
It's in their wills.

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:24.130
They left her the house.

01:33:25.305 --> 01:33:31.187
