We need to replace Weston Field.

00:01.915 --> 00:03.673
I need to examine a real heart.

00:03.993 --> 00:05.425
- It's been embalmed.
- So?

00:05.585 --> 00:07.034
I can't do anything with this.

00:07.154 --> 00:08.834
I don't understand why you do his job.

00:08.954 --> 00:12.140
I don't wanna do his job. I just
don't want anybody else to screw it up.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.424
So you did.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.394
What do you want?

00:18.215 --> 00:19.244
Wes' job.

00:20.059 --> 00:21.024
Say again.

00:21.379 --> 00:22.692
I remembered her name.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.110
Yeah?

00:24.312 --> 00:27.773
I kept drawing, right,
Nina, the lab, everything.

00:28.084 --> 00:30.691
But it was all fragments.
But I couldn't piece them together.

00:30.811 --> 00:32.107
I couldn't go anywhere.

00:32.226 --> 00:33.787
And I decided to focus on sound.

00:37.408 --> 00:39.501
Nina is the key
to unlocking the memories.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.961
Nina will know. She will remember.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.757
So we just have to find her.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.300
Nina?

Hello?

02:23.604 --> 02:24.404
Nina!

02:26.414 --> 02:27.790
I didn't think you were real.

02:28.004 --> 02:29.228
Of course I am.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.945
I thought you changed your mind.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.470
No, it just took me a while to find it.

So, how'd the book signing go?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.264
It was, you know...

04:21.829 --> 04:22.891
Good turn out?

04:33.271 --> 04:34.319
Wall to wall.

04:34.660 --> 04:36.937
I promise to make the next one,
you just let me know.

04:37.057 --> 04:37.768
Sure.

04:43.715 --> 04:46.076
- Good morning, David.
- Do you have an appointment?

04:46.196 --> 04:49.542
I'd like you to meet Colonel Wade Carson
of the U.S. Strategic Air Command.

04:50.169 --> 04:52.503
Dr. Sandström, pleasure to meet you.

04:52.663 --> 04:53.502
Colonel.

04:53.622 --> 04:56.174
I'm sure this visit doesn't have
anything to do with pleasure.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.502
Actually it's an issue
of National Security.

04:58.622 --> 05:01.419
When isn't it, with you guys?
Who's yanking your chain this time?

05:01.539 --> 05:03.264
Not so much "who" as "what".

05:03.753 --> 05:06.067
We've recently had reports
of suspicious activity

05:06.187 --> 05:08.394
near Arnold Air Force Base,
in Tennessee.

05:08.554 --> 05:09.479
Activity?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.399
Crow attacks.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.617
What'll those crazy terrorists
think up next, eh?

05:26.483 --> 05:27.497
You're serious?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.082
Deadly.

05:39.888 --> 05:41.957
I never wanted to come back here

05:42.305 --> 05:43.596
but I had to.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.091
If my father died

05:46.211 --> 05:49.009
before I had a chance
to make things right...

05:50.347 --> 05:52.209
I couldn't forgive myself.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.718
I'm glad you're here.

05:56.068 --> 05:57.056
So am I.

05:59.587 --> 06:01.556
I should've known something was wrong.

06:01.676 --> 06:04.213
I wanted to call you
or come looking for you...

06:04.333 --> 06:05.348
It's okay.

06:05.755 --> 06:08.951
And I thought
maybe you didn't want to see me again.

06:09.071 --> 06:11.987
I've been trying so hard to remember.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.870
And all this time,

06:15.974 --> 06:17.613
you were always with me.

06:18.474 --> 06:20.024
I missed you so much.

06:24.113 --> 06:26.029
Bob, everything's fine.

06:27.856 --> 06:29.078
What is it?

06:29.745 --> 06:32.569
The work we did at Mr. Roth's lab,
on the stem cells.

06:32.689 --> 06:33.885
What happened?

06:35.391 --> 06:36.607
Look at me.

06:39.631 --> 06:41.112
You really don't remember.

06:45.761 --> 06:48.243
Olivier Roth told David that we failed.

06:48.689 --> 06:50.438
We abandoned the project.

06:51.414 --> 06:55.011
You know Mr. Roth. That's just
his way of protecting himself,

06:55.131 --> 06:56.664
keeping it secret.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.039
And I can prove it.

06:59.692 --> 07:02.175
Because I can feel that you're scared

07:02.335 --> 07:04.011
and you don't know why.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.202
Your Jacobson's organ is working?

07:06.322 --> 07:08.310
I'm completely aware
of people's emotions,

07:08.430 --> 07:10.558
even total strangers,
without having to think about it.

07:10.718 --> 07:13.519
It's so wonderful
to be able to understand someone so...

07:15.008 --> 07:16.395
So completely.

07:16.515 --> 07:18.283
That's what we wanted.

07:19.824 --> 07:21.486
And we are at the beginning.

07:21.824 --> 07:25.449
And to be the first one
to have a part of you inside of me.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.410
You made me a better person.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.055
I'm not so sure.

07:32.242 --> 07:34.492
What is it? What is scaring you so much?

07:34.612 --> 07:37.173
- I don't know. I can't...
- It's okay.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.170
It's okay...

07:43.247 --> 07:44.495
We'll get there.

07:46.122 --> 07:47.102
Together.

07:49.438 --> 07:51.449
I'm sorry,
but I have better things to do

07:51.569 --> 07:53.688
than relive a bad Hitchcock movie.

07:53.808 --> 07:56.312
Except this isn't fiction,
Doctor Sandström.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.374
- No, it's paranoia.
- There's a boy in the hospital

07:59.494 --> 08:01.529
who would argue that,
if he wasn't on a respirator.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.903
Have you ever heard
of the Air Force's BAM Project?

08:04.176 --> 08:05.162
No.

08:05.282 --> 08:07.523
It stands for Bird Avoidance Model.

08:07.912 --> 08:10.358
We're constantly monitoring migrations,

08:10.478 --> 08:14.178
putting out daily bird mass projections
for the entire US airspace.

08:14.298 --> 08:16.465
So a couple of angry crows
don't fit with your model

08:16.585 --> 08:19.395
- and you hit the panic button?
- Try hundreds and hundreds, David.

08:19.515 --> 08:21.895
These attacks
occurred in the vicinity of Carlisle,

08:22.015 --> 08:25.216
- near Arnold Air Force Base.
- The best ornithologists in the country

08:25.336 --> 08:28.010
have tried to figure this out.
Nobody can come up with an explanation.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.754
A bunch of crows are effectively
grounding a squadron of B1-B bombers.

08:33.142 --> 08:35.183
We need to know why and who's behind it.

08:35.344 --> 08:37.687
And you think these birds
are working for Al-Qaeda?

08:39.239 --> 08:41.023
It would be extremely risky

08:41.183 --> 08:43.609
scrambling those planes,
should the need arise.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.805
Great.
Alright, perhaps you can tell us...

08:47.148 --> 08:51.116
Have you heard of a swarm of crows
becoming this aggressive, so suddenly?

08:55.096 --> 08:57.362
We have a jet standing by
to take you to Tennessee.

09:01.435 --> 09:02.352
What?

09:02.657 --> 09:03.861
Just a second.

09:03.981 --> 09:05.184
Give me a minute.

09:08.667 --> 09:09.842
Hello, David.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.673
Who is this?

09:12.059 --> 09:13.472
<i>It's Bob.</i>

09:14.321 --> 09:17.143
No, I'm sorry,
Bob doesn't work here anymore.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.980
I'm sorry
I've been a little absent lately.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.235
- Where are you?
- In Michigan.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.876
Well that narrows it down.
What are you lost?

09:25.996 --> 09:27.904
You trapped under a refrigerator, what?

09:28.189 --> 09:29.022
David.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.324
I found her.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.951
I found Nina.

09:34.671 --> 09:35.643
No shit.

09:36.027 --> 09:37.477
Yes. And believe me,

09:37.597 --> 09:39.916
- she's very real.
- Promise me you're safe.

09:40.532 --> 09:41.397
I am.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.295
I can't wait for you to meet her.

09:45.076 --> 09:47.215
- You'll love her.
<i>- Okay, when are you back?</i>

09:47.375 --> 09:49.926
I gotta go, but I'll call you soon.

09:50.604 --> 09:51.465
Bob?

09:51.882 --> 09:52.923
Ah, shit.

09:53.757 --> 09:54.993
- Carlos.
- Yeah?

09:55.113 --> 09:57.391
Pack a bag, we're going bird watching.

09:58.340 --> 10:00.749
You could see them way off,
gathering together.

10:00.869 --> 10:04.036
Then it was like they all just decided
to come into town.

10:04.156 --> 10:06.901
I must've taken down
a hundred in less than five minutes.

10:16.064 --> 10:19.413
Since yesterday people are afraid to go
out of their house to get the mail.

10:20.596 --> 10:22.850
Sounds like some of the locals
are doing their part.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.355
And the Air Force?

10:24.655 --> 10:27.358
We've bagged about 520 crows so far.

10:28.159 --> 10:30.343
Any confirmed kills yourself, Colonel?

10:30.679 --> 10:31.926
Not in this country.

10:36.892 --> 10:38.015
Any thoughts?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.678
Well,

10:41.862 --> 10:44.647
crows are very susceptible to West Nile.
It could be a variant.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.161
It can be environmental.

10:46.281 --> 10:48.484
Or dozens of other things
we don't even know about yet.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.922
Have you noticed
any pattern to the attacks?

10:51.042 --> 10:53.863
The seven wounded,
were they in the same area?

10:53.983 --> 10:55.310
Doing similar activities?

10:55.430 --> 10:57.418
Maybe something threatening
to the crows?

10:57.676 --> 10:59.340
No pattern I'm aware of.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.969
He's off the respirator now,
but he's still a little groggy.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.197
What are his injuries?

11:17.583 --> 11:18.955
He lost his right eye.

11:19.075 --> 11:21.145
Dozens of defensive wounds
to his arms and hands,

11:21.265 --> 11:22.906
left jugular is punctured.

11:23.747 --> 11:24.693
Excuse me.

11:27.493 --> 11:28.589
Hey, Vince.

11:29.910 --> 11:33.070
My name's David. I'm a scientist,
looking into these bird attacks.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.840
Think you can help us out?

11:34.960 --> 11:35.781
Okay.

11:37.061 --> 11:39.201
What you were doing
when the birds came after you?

11:40.150 --> 11:42.236
I was over by Roger's field.

11:42.939 --> 11:44.275
Flying my plane.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.880
Remote control.

11:46.982 --> 11:50.076
Were there a lot of birds around
before you started flying your airplane?

11:51.259 --> 11:52.361
I dunno.

11:52.481 --> 11:54.306
I just heard all this noise.

11:54.611 --> 11:55.877
Turned around.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.103
They were all on me.

11:59.650 --> 12:02.224
The birds, did they attack your plane?

12:02.791 --> 12:03.705
No.

12:04.033 --> 12:04.947
Just me.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.870
I could understand if they confused
the remote control plane

12:19.990 --> 12:21.738
with a raptor, or an owl...

12:21.858 --> 12:23.880
But it sounds like
they just zeroed in on the kid.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.297
Thank you very much.

12:26.141 --> 12:30.634
The US Biological Breeding Bird survey
report no jump in the crow population,

12:30.754 --> 12:32.961
and that normal food sources
are abundant.

12:33.081 --> 12:35.336
- So where does that leave us?
- Localized problem.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.454
Any landfills in the area?

12:37.660 --> 12:39.798
A couple.
But they've been here for years.

12:39.918 --> 12:43.070
What about the Air Force Base?
Do you have any flow of hazardous waste

12:43.190 --> 12:45.436
- or heavy metals?
- We've got a sludge lagoon

12:45.556 --> 12:48.258
and all drainage
diverts around any landfill sites.

12:48.378 --> 12:50.478
EPA's given us a clean bill of health.

12:50.671 --> 12:54.406
You want to point fingers, how about
those cell phone transmission towers?

12:54.526 --> 12:56.603
There's no evidence
of radio waves affecting birds.

12:56.723 --> 12:58.494
Not to the extent seen here.

13:02.935 --> 13:03.826
Jesus.

13:05.068 --> 13:09.005
Okay, we need to get some dead crows,
slice-and-dice, see what we find out.

13:09.860 --> 13:11.168
- That's it?
- That's it.

13:12.646 --> 13:14.880
And here's the asparagus.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.717
You have a lovely home, Mr. Corba.

13:18.975 --> 13:19.929
Frank.

13:20.287 --> 13:21.804
Oh. Thank you very much.

13:23.707 --> 13:25.141
What're you thanking me for?

13:25.261 --> 13:27.524
For allowing me to address you
as "Frank",

13:27.953 --> 13:29.753
- as a sign of...
- That's my name.

13:37.281 --> 13:40.375
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.531
You're a doctor?

13:43.164 --> 13:45.003
You operate with those hands?

13:46.972 --> 13:49.269
No, Frank, I'm a biochemist.

13:49.389 --> 13:51.666
I study chemical processes
and transformations,

13:51.790 --> 13:54.628
- within living organisms...
- I know what a biochemist is.

13:55.158 --> 13:56.714
I'm not a high school dropout.

13:56.986 --> 13:58.090
Dad, please.

13:58.210 --> 13:59.999
What do you mean?
You think I'm an idiot?

14:01.745 --> 14:03.011
Can we just eat?

14:07.628 --> 14:08.612
It's okay.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.382
I should go.

14:12.608 --> 14:13.850
Bob, please...

14:14.436 --> 14:15.350
Sorry.

14:16.218 --> 14:18.569
- I want to support you, but Frank...
- Deserves

14:19.780 --> 14:23.240
the same considerations
for his feelings, I know, you're right.

14:24.674 --> 14:26.452
The hell is wrong with you two?

14:27.143 --> 14:30.436
You even hear yourself talk?
You're like some kind of lobotomized...

14:30.556 --> 14:31.576
head-cases.

14:31.981 --> 14:35.044
- I don't know what you did to her...
- I'm sorry that you're frustrated.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.619
- But, I honestly...
- Would you stop for God's sake?

14:44.171 --> 14:45.108
Nina...

14:46.772 --> 14:47.756
Sorry.

14:49.163 --> 14:50.652
Just give me a minute.

15:07.620 --> 15:08.575
Holy fuck.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.541
<i>Attention passengers, please fasten
your seatbelts and remain seated.</i>

15:25.220 --> 15:26.131
You alright?

15:27.070 --> 15:27.925
Yeah.

15:34.709 --> 15:36.914
- I got a call from Riddlemeyer.
- What does he want?

15:37.034 --> 15:39.305
He's not so hot about me
stepping into Wes' shoes.

15:39.425 --> 15:41.592
What's he going to do?
Fire you? I'll rehire you.

15:41.712 --> 15:44.450
I need you to get me the names of the
best avian behaviorists we can talk to.

15:44.804 --> 15:47.804
- Where we at with the crows?
- So far some number eight shot

15:47.924 --> 15:49.409
and partially digested...

15:49.529 --> 15:50.417
something.

15:50.537 --> 15:52.636
What? Garbage?
Road kill? Human eyeballs?

15:52.756 --> 15:55.415
- I don't know, haven't done a DNA test.
- Quick as you can.

16:27.266 --> 16:28.485
Formaldehyde?

16:29.305 --> 16:30.454
- Oh, David.
- Hey.

16:30.695 --> 16:34.325
So of all the different bacteria,
parasites and viruses, both RNA and DNA,

16:34.445 --> 16:36.506
- known to affect crows...
- We've got 'em all?

16:36.626 --> 16:39.190
No, as a matter of fact,
it's more like "nothing special".

16:39.310 --> 16:41.831
- What about Mad Crow Disease?
- Don't think I didn't go there.

16:41.951 --> 16:44.675
But all the brain tissue samples
looked normal, so...

16:44.879 --> 16:45.757
What?

16:49.920 --> 16:51.930
Yeah, we got it. Where is this?

16:52.226 --> 16:53.974
Almond, North Carolina.

16:54.252 --> 16:56.632
<i>The attacks started
just outside of town this afternoon.</i>

16:56.752 --> 16:58.479
- Any wounded?
<i>- Several.</i>

16:58.639 --> 17:00.606
Two attacks, different states.
What's going on?

17:00.766 --> 17:03.282
I don't know any obvious connections
between...

17:03.402 --> 17:05.693
Carlisle, Tennessee
and Almond, North Carolina.

17:05.813 --> 17:09.577
But I do see something obvious that's
not in common: military installations.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.117
You're forgetting Pope Air Force Base,
near Fayetteville.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.416
That's 523 km from the attack site.

17:20.650 --> 17:22.461
That's a long way from Almond, Carl.

17:22.621 --> 17:25.422
You may also wanna know
that the CIA has intercepted

17:25.541 --> 17:27.058
<i>some chatter from Iraq.</i>

17:27.501 --> 17:29.166
<i>According to the translators,</i>

17:29.541 --> 17:32.166
<i>these attacks may be
a diversionary tactic.</i>

17:32.286 --> 17:33.994
Well it ain't working on me.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.685
Second attack, North Carolina.

17:37.805 --> 17:40.437
- Not a clue as to a connection.
- Might have something to do with moles.

17:40.557 --> 17:42.551
The ones underground or on the skin?

17:42.671 --> 17:43.586
Mammalia.

17:43.808 --> 17:46.642
The stomach contents of the crows
was for the most part normal:

17:46.762 --> 17:48.487
insects, corn, worms.

17:48.622 --> 17:50.948
But we also found
the remains of moles in all of them.

17:51.068 --> 17:51.868
So?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.952
Moles don't surface during the day.
And crows don't feed at night.

17:55.251 --> 17:58.622
But there's something else.
The moles smelled funny.

17:58.782 --> 18:01.017
It came from inside the stomach
of a dead crow.

18:01.137 --> 18:04.753
They smelled of formaldehyde so I did
a chemical analysis and confirmed it.

18:05.148 --> 18:08.507
All the moles have been contaminated
with low levels of formaldehyde.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.427
Okay, in human beings
this would cause what?

18:12.834 --> 18:16.515
Blindness, organ damage,
possibly respiratory problems.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.499
There's no industry in Carlisle
that would be using formaldehyde resin.

18:21.713 --> 18:24.718
You know, maybe we're missing
the link here because we can't see it.

18:24.838 --> 18:28.053
All this time, we've been distracted
by looking up at crows.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.154
Maybe we need to look down.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.157
<i>You found formaldehyde in the soil?</i>

18:50.277 --> 18:52.719
Yeah, it seems to be coming
from the cemetery.

18:52.839 --> 18:56.472
Ten acres permeated with formaldehyde.
That's a lot of leaking corpses.

18:56.592 --> 18:58.719
It could be what's causing
the moles to surface.

18:58.839 --> 18:59.905
I would.

19:00.025 --> 19:01.574
It's a good hypothesis.

19:01.984 --> 19:04.530
When we first got here,
we saw quite a few moles above ground.

19:04.650 --> 19:06.871
Some kind of population explosion.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.973
Send some back for analysis.

19:10.093 --> 19:13.212
<i>There might be some kind of connection
between the moles and the birds.</i>

19:13.332 --> 19:16.261
I'm about to have Rachel carve up
some North Carolina crow.

19:16.381 --> 19:19.837
If we find they've been eating moles,
I'd say that qualifies as a connection.

19:20.855 --> 19:21.856
Alright.

19:26.661 --> 19:27.669
Heads up!

19:35.378 --> 19:38.055
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, take cover.

19:51.430 --> 19:52.743
There, come on.

20:31.957 --> 20:34.042
I was wondering where you went to.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.400
Why are you packed?

20:43.206 --> 20:44.700
I have to leave, Nina.

20:46.510 --> 20:47.987
Because of my father?

20:49.345 --> 20:50.641
I'm scared, Nina.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.851
And I'm not sure of what.

20:54.185 --> 20:56.139
But I do know where I have to go.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.278
Back to Roth's lab.

21:00.422 --> 21:02.733
You know I can't leave my father.

21:03.565 --> 21:05.113
David will come with me.

21:05.233 --> 21:08.604
He's used to mind my panic attacks.
He's good that way.

21:13.549 --> 21:15.821
You don't know what you'll find, do you?

21:18.798 --> 21:20.292
That's what scares me.

21:34.295 --> 21:35.118
Nina,

21:35.554 --> 21:36.922
I'll be back soon.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.414
Bob, please.

22:05.102 --> 22:06.382
Before you go...

22:09.414 --> 22:12.287
I know I wasn't much of a father...

22:13.690 --> 22:14.987
Yes you were.

22:17.227 --> 22:18.589
I love you, Daddy.

22:19.785 --> 22:21.427
I love you too, honey.

22:29.309 --> 22:32.937
So does that young man
you're letting drive off...

22:39.369 --> 22:41.405
Bob! Bob!

23:02.419 --> 23:04.079
- What do you got?
- DNA confirms that

23:04.199 --> 23:06.805
no moles in the digestive tracts
of the crows from North Carolina.

23:07.015 --> 23:07.806
None?

23:07.966 --> 23:09.850
No, sorry. So much for the mole theory.

23:10.010 --> 23:12.796
- What's this spike here?
- It's a toxicology report.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.355
Everything's normal
except slight traces of copper.

23:15.516 --> 23:18.139
In both the Carolina
and the Tennessee birds?{\
- Yup.}

23:19.079 --> 23:21.608
Copper poisoning
is associated with dementia.

23:22.336 --> 23:25.330
Wait a minute. We found slight traces
of copper in the moles as well.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.977
I mean, barely detectable,
and probably harmless, but...

23:28.097 --> 23:29.286
If it's not the moles...

23:29.406 --> 23:31.736
It's what they're eating
they have in common with the crows.

23:31.856 --> 23:33.705
- What do they eat?
- Mostly insects.

23:33.825 --> 23:37.299
So soil samples
that Carlos sent from Tennessee,

23:37.419 --> 23:40.520
- mainly grubs and earthworms.
- Test everything. Insects, soil.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.209
Carlos said there was
a mole population explosion.

23:43.329 --> 23:45.177
So that could mean
that their food source...

23:45.337 --> 23:46.894
You guys gotta see this.

23:51.088 --> 23:53.612
Okay, so attacks have been confirmed
in Kentucky,

23:53.732 --> 23:56.912
North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia,
West Virginia, and in Maryland,

23:57.032 --> 24:00.400
where a C5 Lockheed Galaxy went down,
that's a huge military transport.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.200
- Any casualties?
- Pilot and co-pilot.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.955
Just after takeoff the pilot reported
multiple strikes and engine failure.

24:06.075 --> 24:08.956
I'm gonna need to see the data on
the Tennessee insect and soil samples.

24:09.076 --> 24:11.457
Have them measure
the copper levels as well.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.830
Mayko, can you
pull up that database again?

24:14.535 --> 24:18.491
This time, run a sequence in order
of attack locations, from first to last.

24:21.281 --> 24:22.480
- You see that?
- Yeah.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.450
Whatever's triggering these crow attacks
is moving northwards.

24:25.570 --> 24:28.520
It seems to be localized
in the Eastern half of the US.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.175
Lay in all the airports.
Including the military ones.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.080
See, the civilian airports are
on the outskirts of cities.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.952
Military airports are in the country
where the crows are.

24:40.072 --> 24:42.079
That's why they thought
they were under attack.

24:42.199 --> 24:44.903
Just some good old-fashioned
military paranoia.

24:46.575 --> 24:47.709
It's funny.

24:48.593 --> 24:52.454
In the past 28 hours I feeled liked
we've gone from reunion to retirement.

24:54.046 --> 24:56.020
Must be the recreational vehicle.

24:56.140 --> 24:57.742
You're happy, aren't you?

24:58.699 --> 24:59.699
Very much.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.565
I really liked waking up
beside you. And...

25:11.699 --> 25:12.848
everything else.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.411
Bob!

25:15.388 --> 25:17.205
Sorry, I've embarrassed both of us.

25:17.387 --> 25:18.362
Trust me,

25:18.685 --> 25:20.939
you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

25:23.099 --> 25:24.232
That's good.

25:26.138 --> 25:28.613
Seems to me like
you could use a little relaxing now.

25:28.773 --> 25:31.466
You've been clenching that fist
for the last hour.

25:32.142 --> 25:33.308
Yes, I see.

25:40.754 --> 25:41.952
Are you tense?

25:43.512 --> 25:44.283
No.

25:45.802 --> 25:48.166
But I remembered
why I needed to find you.

26:00.836 --> 26:02.011
What're you doing?

26:03.261 --> 26:04.623
Uh, be right there.

26:17.942 --> 26:18.757
Nina,

26:21.121 --> 26:24.738
I know I've only loved you only
for a short time, and well, I...

26:29.806 --> 26:32.931
It was difficult for me to say
because I remember practicing

26:33.051 --> 26:35.666
but I don't remember the words for it.

26:38.146 --> 26:40.936
I just really want to be clear
in this moment

26:42.260 --> 26:44.397
and I know I should stop focusing
on the presentation...

26:45.382 --> 26:46.448
What is it?

26:50.122 --> 26:51.567
I owe you an apology.

26:56.989 --> 26:59.237
I don't know where I lost the real one.

27:01.135 --> 27:05.096
When Richard Drew made this tape in 1925

27:05.216 --> 27:06.461
it wasn't very sticky

27:06.696 --> 27:10.589
and some people thought it was cheap
and made by frugal Scotsmen

27:10.751 --> 27:13.369
so it got its name "Scotch" tape.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.479
But now it's stickier.

27:17.149 --> 27:18.331
More adhesive.

27:18.893 --> 27:21.459
To make sure that things stick together

27:21.579 --> 27:23.186
for a long long time.

27:24.123 --> 27:25.522
I love you, Bob.

27:28.841 --> 27:29.648
Nina,

27:29.870 --> 27:32.665
what I really want is that...

27:33.762 --> 27:35.306
I was just wondering...

27:42.012 --> 27:43.960
Will you marry me,

27:44.436 --> 27:45.917
Nina, please?

27:47.509 --> 27:48.280
Yes!

27:57.761 --> 27:58.893
It's perfect.

28:13.165 --> 28:15.682
Hey, normal levels of copper
in the soil,

28:15.802 --> 28:18.867
tested around the area with the moles,
down to eight feet below ground. Here.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.702
I'm hearing a lot of what we don't have.

28:21.822 --> 28:24.788
Well, what we do have, by the thousands,

28:24.949 --> 28:26.285
are maggots,

28:26.936 --> 28:29.203
beetle larvae and cicada nymphs.

28:29.323 --> 28:31.838
- Your basic mole diet.
- All of which tested normal.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.261
Yeah, but check this out.

28:33.387 --> 28:37.384
These are periodical cicadas, the kind
that gestate underground for 17 years.

28:37.546 --> 28:40.623
Now, almost every year,
somewhere in North America,

28:40.743 --> 28:43.702
a group of cicadas,
they call them "broods", emerges.

28:43.822 --> 28:47.887
But the cicadas that you had analyzed,
where were they in their life cycle?

28:48.007 --> 28:49.666
Almost a couple of months old,

28:49.786 --> 28:52.566
which classifies them
as part of "Brood 14".

28:52.686 --> 28:56.411
Okay, not too long ago in Tennessee,
cicadas emerged.

28:56.912 --> 28:59.653
Yeah, so, after 17 years underground,

28:59.773 --> 29:03.870
feeding on grass and tree roots, the now
adult cicadas crawled up to the surface,

29:04.456 --> 29:07.165
dried out their wings and
did their thing for a couple of weeks.

29:07.612 --> 29:10.013
- "Did their thing"?
- Yes, "did their thing".

29:10.133 --> 29:12.588
The males screech out some love songs,
attract a mate,

29:12.708 --> 29:14.722
copulate and then
they pretty much die right after.

29:14.842 --> 29:17.641
Now the females only die
after laying their eggs.

29:17.761 --> 29:20.302
- Eggs hatch, out come the nymphs.
- Nymphs burrow into the ground,

29:20.464 --> 29:23.518
- the whole cycle starts again.
- But if the cicadas tested normal.

29:23.638 --> 29:27.710
I know, but look at this. Look at
the range of this year's emergence.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.823
Okay, in the blue, 13 states.

29:29.948 --> 29:33.926
6 of them just happen to be
the same ones reporting crow attacks.

29:34.394 --> 29:35.276
Okay...

29:37.369 --> 29:39.592
Except the attacks
are moving northwards.

29:39.712 --> 29:43.364
Got a cicada emergence in Georgia,
but they have no problems with crows.

29:43.484 --> 29:46.621
- So that pokes a few holes.
- Alright, but apart from the cicadas,

29:46.781 --> 29:49.707
what do the other states have in common
that Georgia doesn't?

29:50.825 --> 29:52.792
Well, they feed on grass and tree roots.

29:52.912 --> 29:55.171
Could be regional
vegetation differences.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.836
If we get attacks in Indiana and Ohio,

29:58.956 --> 30:01.483
I think it's a good indication
there's something to these hatchings.

30:01.909 --> 30:04.719
Still doesn't make any fucking sense.
You said the nymphs tested normal?

30:04.839 --> 30:05.573
Yeah.

30:08.022 --> 30:09.795
Bring Riddlemeyer up to speed.

30:09.915 --> 30:13.068
Let him know there's a chance
that this year's "Cicada States"

30:13.188 --> 30:15.520
might have a few crow issues
in the near future.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.693
When he asks "why"?

30:18.618 --> 30:20.697
Tell him it's a sign of the Apocalypse.

30:42.125 --> 30:44.271
Hey! Move this piece
of shit out of here!

30:44.391 --> 30:47.121
What the hell you think this is,
a trailer park?

30:52.644 --> 30:53.699
Hello, Bob.

30:53.819 --> 30:54.981
Hello, David.

30:55.409 --> 30:56.572
Welcome back.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.368
I guess I should say
something profound...

31:08.364 --> 31:11.005
David, I know this is a lot
of information all at once,

31:11.125 --> 31:13.655
and I'm sorry to surprise you like this.

31:13.775 --> 31:15.009
No, It's...

31:17.856 --> 31:18.630
Nina.

31:20.194 --> 31:22.462
May you share everything with Bob.

31:23.212 --> 31:24.636
That's nice, David.

31:24.890 --> 31:26.540
Including the housework.

31:28.195 --> 31:31.741
He tends to mask affection with sarcasm,
but he means well.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.651
So, Nina.

31:37.936 --> 31:38.866
The lab.

31:39.342 --> 31:40.540
Olivier Roth.

31:41.055 --> 31:42.168
Help me out.

31:45.372 --> 31:46.503
Subtle, David.

31:46.623 --> 31:48.612
What? For Christ's sake, Bob,

31:48.732 --> 31:51.619
I've been going through this brain fart
with you for two months now.

31:51.876 --> 31:53.033
Bob trusts you.

31:53.153 --> 31:54.429
I know that. But...

31:54.549 --> 31:55.998
he's still scared.

31:56.118 --> 31:59.212
- There's some pieces missing...
- What do you mean, "missing"?

31:59.779 --> 32:01.422
Pre-trials all went well.

32:01.931 --> 32:03.466
Pre-trials on what?

32:05.269 --> 32:06.233
Primates.

32:06.353 --> 32:09.393
Injected with my stem cells. But we...

32:10.134 --> 32:13.058
didn't wait long enough,
we moved on too early.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.070
Bob,

32:15.190 --> 32:16.265
look at me.

32:16.755 --> 32:19.607
I am living proof
that you made the right decisions.

32:20.243 --> 32:23.232
What, wait a minute! Are you telling me
that you've had this procedure done?

32:23.352 --> 32:26.114
And it worked.
I have a heightened sense of empathy.

32:26.274 --> 32:28.241
That's just fucking great!

32:29.185 --> 32:32.114
Shoot first
and ask questions later, is that it?

32:33.489 --> 32:36.708
- Someone had to be the first volunteer.
- No, they didn't!

32:37.630 --> 32:39.001
No, they didn't...

32:49.899 --> 32:52.932
- I have to ask you a favor, David.
- I'm not giving you away.

32:53.661 --> 32:55.541
I need you to go back to

32:55.661 --> 32:57.024
Roth's lab with me.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.563
Did he contact you?

32:59.420 --> 33:00.220
No.

33:01.037 --> 33:02.650
But I have to see for myself.

33:03.530 --> 33:05.551
To know that everything's alright.

33:06.209 --> 33:07.790
Roth says the experiment failed.

33:07.910 --> 33:11.892
Nina says the opposite,
and she is the opposite of failure.

33:14.087 --> 33:16.800
Conflicting information tells me
that I am scared

33:17.443 --> 33:18.810
for a good reason.

33:28.451 --> 33:29.619
- Bob?
- Hey.

33:30.233 --> 33:33.373
Five new crow attacks:
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania.

33:33.493 --> 33:35.471
All recent cicada hatching states,
David.

33:35.591 --> 33:38.395
- Any of them near airports?
- One, in Pennsylvania. Not military.

33:38.515 --> 33:41.674
But a Cessna did crash on landing.
Multiple bird strikes. No fatalities.

33:41.794 --> 33:45.290
Good, contact the FAA, have them warn
all the airports in the affected states.

33:45.410 --> 33:46.651
Still nothing in Georgia?

33:46.771 --> 33:49.267
No, and no other attack reports
except in states that...

33:49.387 --> 33:51.600
That had this year's cicada hatching.
I get it.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.615
The question is why? And why just crows?

33:53.735 --> 33:55.382
- I have no idea.
- Neither do I.

33:55.502 --> 33:58.593
It'd be nice to have
a fresh set of eyes on this. Bob!

34:00.393 --> 34:03.522
Sorry, David, we just met
the new lab tech: Bilal.

34:03.756 --> 34:05.452
Seems nice, a bit quiet.

34:07.158 --> 34:09.174
- This is...
- Nina?

34:09.514 --> 34:11.473
Bob,
there's been some more crashes, okay?

34:11.592 --> 34:14.231
Mayko, this is the soon-to-be Mrs. Bob.

34:14.966 --> 34:16.663
I like that, "Mrs"...

34:21.472 --> 34:22.984
I understand the point, David.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.783
Is there a correlation between
the location of the crow attacks,

34:25.902 --> 34:28.150
this year's cicada emergence,
and indigenous vegetation.

34:28.271 --> 34:31.989
The cicada nymphs burrow underground,
and they feed on the tree roots.

34:32.149 --> 34:33.491
They suck on them, actually.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.159
Right... Well, look,

34:36.911 --> 34:37.676
see?

34:37.795 --> 34:40.581
From birch trees, to oak trees
and almost everything in between,

34:40.991 --> 34:44.418
- eastern US has it all.
- But not junipers, or redwoods, or...

34:44.579 --> 34:48.034
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
North Carolina, Ohio.

34:48.155 --> 34:50.514
These states,
they all have three things in common.

34:50.634 --> 34:53.137
They've got crow attacks,
they've got a recent cicada hatching,

34:53.257 --> 34:55.760
and they've got over
a dozen different species of trees.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.765
So how do we narrow it down?

34:58.322 --> 35:00.510
Assuming, of course,
there is a correlation between

35:00.630 --> 35:03.051
- this year's emergence and...
- Humor me.

35:04.257 --> 35:05.511
Difficult to do.

35:06.272 --> 35:10.111
There're so many vegetative combinations
and permutations to consider.

35:11.601 --> 35:13.464
Okay, so aside from the cicadas,

35:13.584 --> 35:16.622
you said there were other insects
found in the Tennessee soil samples.

35:16.742 --> 35:17.550
Yeah.

35:19.643 --> 35:20.850
Look at this.

35:23.784 --> 35:25.251
<i>Scolytus multistriatus.</i>

35:25.411 --> 35:27.077
- English.
- Elm bark beetle.

35:27.197 --> 35:29.881
- Special because?
- They eat elm trees.

35:31.292 --> 35:33.719
- Look at the range.
- Okay, elm trees.

35:34.265 --> 35:36.637
I was looking at maps
of almost every kind of tree.

35:39.051 --> 35:40.151
Here you go.

35:40.926 --> 35:42.351
Well that's interesting.

35:42.786 --> 35:45.669
But you said there haven't been
any crow attacks in Georgia.

35:46.307 --> 35:48.938
But in comparison
to all these other hatching states,

35:49.058 --> 35:51.254
Georgia barely has any elm trees at all.

35:51.374 --> 35:53.196
I think you're on to something, Bob.

35:54.584 --> 35:55.406
Good.

35:55.566 --> 35:57.700
It's amazing to put faces to names.

35:58.414 --> 36:01.537
- Bob talks about you guys all the time.
- Good things I hope.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.091
So,

36:05.651 --> 36:07.168
how did you meet?

36:09.018 --> 36:10.254
We worked together.

36:10.757 --> 36:14.367
I should probably
let Bob give you the details.

36:15.304 --> 36:17.470
Are you a doctor?
Is that how you two...?

36:17.630 --> 36:19.721
I was in the middle of my doctorate.

36:19.841 --> 36:22.266
Neurology.
Specializing in regenerative therapy.

36:22.893 --> 36:24.662
- Stem cells.
- That's right.

36:25.429 --> 36:26.361
<i>Mayko!</i>

36:26.648 --> 36:28.205
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

36:28.644 --> 36:30.236
Welcome to the family.

36:31.351 --> 36:33.194
Just a little dysfunctional.

36:33.354 --> 36:34.235
Right.

36:35.854 --> 36:37.031
I'm right here.

36:37.558 --> 36:38.783
Ah, there you are.

36:39.446 --> 36:40.909
Quick as you can.

36:41.029 --> 36:44.147
You want elm tree root samples
for Tennessee, Ohio and Georgia?

36:44.267 --> 36:48.225
Contact the USDA. And pull any info
you can on the rest of the list.

36:48.744 --> 36:50.119
Wait wait wait.

36:50.379 --> 36:53.080
2011 cicada nymph hatchings?
Don't you mean this year's?

36:53.290 --> 36:54.968
No, this year's have already emerged.

36:55.088 --> 36:58.261
And since we need to test the nymphs
underground at the end of their cycle,

36:58.421 --> 37:01.296
we'd have to wait another 17 years
to test this year's brood.

37:01.416 --> 37:04.049
2011 nymphs are still underground.

37:04.282 --> 37:06.185
I don't know how soon
I can get all this to you.

37:06.345 --> 37:08.119
You should be done by now.

37:09.899 --> 37:13.141
Each of this year's cicada states
have elm trees in common.

37:13.261 --> 37:14.402
Why is that relevant?

37:14.612 --> 37:17.423
Well, along with the cicada nymphs,
we found elm bark beetles

37:17.543 --> 37:19.731
within the Tennessee soil samples.

37:19.957 --> 37:23.578
Insects notorious for transmitting
<i>Ophiostoma ulmi</i>.

37:24.955 --> 37:28.666
- Dutch Elm disease.
- The disease hit in 1928, in Ohio.

37:28.786 --> 37:30.960
It spread halfway
across the US in four decades.

37:31.802 --> 37:35.388
Block after block of beautiful
suburban streets withered and died.

37:35.508 --> 37:37.758
Property values plummeted. Panic set it.

37:38.245 --> 37:41.504
And then in 1939,
they sprayed everything with DDT.

37:41.714 --> 37:44.428
By the mid-50s the WHO suspected
it caused cancer,

37:44.548 --> 37:46.517
but they didn't ban it until 72.

37:47.731 --> 37:51.384
Meanwhile Dutch Elm disease kept
spreading. So guess what they did next.

37:51.504 --> 37:53.192
Three decades of chemical cocktails,

37:53.312 --> 37:55.318
sprayed and spiked directly
into the Elm trees.

37:55.528 --> 37:56.930
Look, dioxins,

37:57.530 --> 38:00.565
all sorts of shit
including copper sulfate.

38:00.775 --> 38:02.325
And the trees soaked it all up.

38:02.485 --> 38:05.319
So below ground,
cicadas are feeding on the roots?

38:05.880 --> 38:07.955
But David, we tested them.
Toxicity was normal.

38:08.557 --> 38:11.826
Normal for an insect 8 weeks
into a 17-year life cycle.

38:12.036 --> 38:15.929
The 2011 brood have been sucking
on toxic tree roots for 10 years now.

38:16.049 --> 38:17.239
And guess what?

38:17.781 --> 38:19.584
Higher accumulation of copper.

38:20.893 --> 38:23.270
In fact
the cicadas are eating xylem sap,

38:23.390 --> 38:26.557
which is where the copper circulates,
so they'd have good long-term exposure.

38:27.048 --> 38:29.226
You'd think that would
just kill the cicada nymphs, no?

38:29.775 --> 38:31.316
- They must adapt over time.
- No.

38:31.436 --> 38:33.547
Cicadas have proteobacterial symbionts

38:33.717 --> 38:36.392
that probably help them achieve
a copper tolerance.

38:36.602 --> 38:38.805
So the bacteria in their guts
"sop up" the copper.

38:38.975 --> 38:40.054
Exactly.

38:40.479 --> 38:41.650
So the cicadas

38:41.770 --> 38:44.698
increasingly became laden
with copper sulfate.

38:44.818 --> 38:49.011
This latest hatching was basically
a chemical bomb 70 years in the making.

38:49.904 --> 38:52.116
So summer arrives,
warm weather moves north...

38:52.326 --> 38:55.481
- As the attacks do.
- Soil temperature rises 62 degrees,

38:55.601 --> 38:58.047
triggering the adult cicadas
to crawl up from under.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.791
And boom!
Cicadas explode into the food chain.

39:00.961 --> 39:03.106
The crows move in,
they stake their territories

39:03.276 --> 39:06.493
and basically gorge for weeks
on toxic cicadas.

39:06.613 --> 39:09.517
And the copper streams into the blood,
diffuses to their brains...

39:09.727 --> 39:12.428
Affecting proteins specific
only to crows.

39:12.807 --> 39:15.022
Essentially what we're looking at here

39:15.182 --> 39:16.936
is avian schizophrenia.

39:20.980 --> 39:24.805
- Except, what about Georgia?
- Elms are few and far between there.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.692
They got their share
of toxic treatments,

39:26.812 --> 39:29.946
but nowhere near the levels
of other current cicada hatching states.

39:30.206 --> 39:32.202
Intelligence reports suggest otherwise.

39:32.372 --> 39:35.495
Come on, Colonel.
Crow attacks as a diversionary tactic?

39:35.665 --> 39:38.713
You know what? They're right,
because look at you, you're diverted.

39:38.923 --> 39:41.806
You're sitting here in my office
worried about birds.

39:42.907 --> 39:45.553
Look, I think this chatter
that the CIA intercepted

39:45.713 --> 39:47.058
was merely observational.

39:47.178 --> 39:49.348
Try to relax until the summer of 2011.

39:49.712 --> 39:51.036
What happens then?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.662
The next cicada hatching
in 16 different states

39:53.782 --> 39:56.347
all of which have been sprayed
for Dutch Elm disease.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.946
- How many hatchings are there?
- Enough to keep the military "diverted"

40:01.066 --> 40:03.177
for the rest of your career, I imagine.

40:03.297 --> 40:05.550
We'll run out of crows to shoot by then.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.245
That's assuming that future hatchings
will only affect crows.

40:09.415 --> 40:12.196
Who knows what you'll be shooting at
17 years from now.

40:32.434 --> 40:33.947
Is this helping at all?

40:38.191 --> 40:39.602
It was our last day,

40:40.084 --> 40:41.445
we were closing up,

40:42.002 --> 40:43.819
the animals were getting picked up.

40:44.593 --> 40:46.197
I had to secure the lab.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.780
Alright,
let's see if anybody's home, Bob.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.690
I can't remember the access code.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.469
After you, Bob.

41:18.245 --> 41:19.586
It's okay, baby.

41:20.248 --> 41:21.279
It's okay.

41:41.137 --> 41:42.846
We had finished our work...

41:46.154 --> 41:47.833
Roth had left.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.178
The lab was being dismantled.

41:52.961 --> 41:54.479
I told him to stop.

42:00.042 --> 42:01.569
I don't understand.

42:02.391 --> 42:04.975
We made a mistake, we can't keep going.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.445
- I told him...
- Stop what, Bob? What was he doing?

42:08.833 --> 42:11.373
- The trials. We made a mistake.
- No, Bob,

42:11.493 --> 42:13.025
the trials were good.

42:26.112 --> 42:27.609
But it was too soon.

42:28.037 --> 42:30.747
Too soon for what, Bob?
What are you afraid of?

42:53.203 --> 42:55.576
Bob, we came here to end this,
not run away from it again.

42:55.786 --> 42:58.245
- I don't want to be here and do this.
- It's okay.

42:58.708 --> 43:01.081
- We can leave if you want to.
- Fuck that shit!

43:13.092 --> 43:14.553
Can we please just leave?

43:14.763 --> 43:16.124
I don't think so.

43:31.861 --> 43:33.272
Open this door.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.034
If you're going to remember,
you're going to have to relive it, Bob.

43:37.194 --> 43:38.494
Now open the damn door!

44:10.407 --> 44:11.869
Oh, Jesus.

44:12.799 --> 44:13.654
Fuck...

44:16.067 --> 44:17.816
What the fuck happened here?

44:20.346 --> 44:23.730
"GEN 011 S2".

44:24.700 --> 44:28.008
- What is this mean?
- The second stage primate trials.

44:28.781 --> 44:31.445
Injected with my stem cells.

44:35.125 --> 44:37.177
Looks like somebody
didn't want them around anymore.

44:42.949 --> 44:45.010
They did this to themselves.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.149
I thought you said
the trials were a success.

44:51.403 --> 44:54.681
Transformed into highly
empathetic animals.

44:55.468 --> 44:57.180
This isn't empathy, Bob.

44:57.777 --> 44:58.955
It's insanity.

45:04.819 --> 45:06.040
Oh my God!

45:06.375 --> 45:07.581
What about me?
