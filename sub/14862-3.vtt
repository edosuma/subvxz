WEBVTT

00:03.923 --> 00:05.091
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:05.091 --> 00:06.159
Aren't you the boss?

00:06.159 --> 00:07.927
I have never met anyone like you, Joss.

00:07.927 --> 00:11.131
This is our son Sam. Dr.
Kim was Dad's therapist.

00:11.131 --> 00:13.634
I don't want to see you
again. Do you understand?

00:13.634 --> 00:16.203
Richard, would you like to go
out to dinner with me sometime?

00:16.203 --> 00:17.838
- Pick me up at 8:00.
- Okay.

00:17.838 --> 00:19.373
(Savannah) Her name is Miranda Nickleby.

00:19.373 --> 00:22.376
Then I... I just don't
understand how anyone can cheat.

00:22.376 --> 00:24.545
I cheated on Harry last night.

00:24.545 --> 00:26.280
You should've kept that to yourself.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.283
(birds chirping)

00:34.321 --> 00:35.789
(laughs)

00:35.789 --> 00:39.226
(laughs)

00:39.226 --> 00:41.495
(sighs)

00:41.495 --> 00:44.098
No. No. Don't touch.
Don't touch. Don't touch.

00:44.098 --> 00:46.400
No. No. Don't. Don't. Don't move.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.434
You mean like this?

00:47.434 --> 00:48.836
No. No. No. No. No.

00:48.836 --> 00:52.836
(laughs)

00:54.375 --> 00:57.311
God, I love you lately.

00:57.311 --> 00:59.213
I love you lately, too.

00:59.213 --> 01:02.616
This is the 22-year-old surf
goddess I met at Byron Bay.

01:02.616 --> 01:05.519
Mmm. Minus the crop top and the cornrows.

01:05.519 --> 01:06.787
(laughs) Yes.

01:06.787 --> 01:08.555
And your infected belly
ring. Remember that?

01:08.555 --> 01:11.358
Oh, you know you loved
that infected belly ring.

01:11.358 --> 01:13.093
It was all green and crusty.

01:13.013 --> 01:15.416
Mm. No way. (blows raspberry)

01:15.416 --> 01:18.152
(laughs)

01:18.152 --> 01:19.553
What?

01:19.598 --> 01:21.600
Babe, it's quarter after 9:00.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.736
So?

01:23.736 --> 01:26.305
So shouldn't you get to the office?

01:28.140 --> 01:29.174
Mm.

01:29.174 --> 01:31.143
Sav, seriously.

01:31.143 --> 01:32.311
Come on.

01:32.361 --> 01:34.663
A week of lazy mornings
in? "Lunches" at home?

01:34.663 --> 01:36.231
I mean, don't get me wrong,

01:36.231 --> 01:39.635
I'm... I'm loving every
minute of it, but...

01:39.635 --> 01:42.805
somebody's gotta be
missing you at work, right?

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.181 --> 01:53.615
(laughs)

01:53.615 --> 01:54.850
Be...

01:54.850 --> 01:56.685
here...

01:56.685 --> 01:58.187
now.

(cell phone rings)

02:10.646 --> 02:11.848
(Lucy) Aren't you gonna answer it?

02:11.848 --> 02:13.650
(sighs)

02:13.650 --> 02:15.953
Who's Miranda? She's called you,
like, three times this morning.

02:15.953 --> 02:18.622
Oh, she's my gynecologist.

02:18.622 --> 02:21.091
You have your gyno
programmed by her first name?

02:21.091 --> 02:23.260
Well, when you have a gynecologist,

02:23.260 --> 02:25.262
you'll understand how
close a relationship it is.

02:25.262 --> 02:26.763
If it's such a close relationship,

02:26.763 --> 02:29.132
why do you keep ignoring her calls?

02:29.132 --> 02:31.001
Go to school.

02:31.001 --> 02:32.669
(school bell rings)

02:32.669 --> 02:33.704
(exhales)

02:33.704 --> 02:35.072
Love you.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.840
(sighs) (car door closes)

02:39.142 --> 02:42.045
Richard, hi.

02:42.045 --> 02:44.648
(girl) I love you, Dad. Bye.

02:52.756 --> 02:56.827
Mm. I had a... a patient once
with an apartment like this.

02:56.827 --> 02:59.796
He had, uh, 14 cats and
a pluralist manifesto.

02:59.796 --> 03:03.200
These ancient files
should be on hard drive.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.269
So you're just over a crisis then?

03:05.269 --> 03:07.871
- What?
- Well, whenever you're fresh out of a crisis,

03:07.871 --> 03:10.107
you throw your entire office
into the center of the room

03:10.107 --> 03:12.643
and alphabetize it.

03:12.643 --> 03:16.613
I had some personal
stuff, and now it's over.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.316
Putting the past on the cloud,
as the kids say nowadays.

03:19.316 --> 03:21.918
Yeah, I wouldn't quote
the kids you talk to.

03:21.918 --> 03:23.687
(chuckles)

03:26.690 --> 03:28.158
Elizabeth.

03:28.158 --> 03:30.093
Karen.

03:30.093 --> 03:32.629
A place we can talk?

03:43.173 --> 03:44.574
Get a longer skirt.

03:44.574 --> 03:45.742
(elevator bell dings)

03:45.742 --> 03:47.577
Get a taller child.

03:54.584 --> 03:57.287
- What's wrong with Mona?
- They close the nearest blouse barn?

03:57.287 --> 03:58.955
We're all getting fired.

03:58.955 --> 04:01.124
- What?
- Oh, we're not getting fired, Mona.

04:01.124 --> 04:03.760
Our boss just got fired.
You don't think we're next?

04:03.760 --> 04:06.263
- Mac was fired?
- The firm's been bought out.

04:06.263 --> 04:08.332
- Who would buy us? We kinda suck.
- Mm, he won't tell us.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.635
- Who won't?
- That jerk in Mac's office.

04:11.635 --> 04:13.103
He's been in there for
an hour on the phone,

04:13.103 --> 04:14.771
just trying to make us sweat.

04:14.771 --> 04:17.741
(sighs) Don't worry,
people. I'll get him off.

04:17.741 --> 04:19.709
If anyone can.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.211
(knock on door) (man) Entrez.

04:21.211 --> 04:22.346
Si. Si. E un modo molto

04:22.346 --> 04:26.346
decisamente Americano Della morale.

04:27.751 --> 04:28.985
Si. Si.

04:28.985 --> 04:30.721
(door closes) Hi.

04:30.721 --> 04:33.123
Josslyn Carver, top sales
associate. And you are?

04:35.559 --> 04:37.561
(chuckles)

04:37.561 --> 04:39.262
I'm sure you don't mean
to terrorize everyone

04:39.262 --> 04:41.131
at such a vulnerable time.

04:41.131 --> 04:43.233
Perhaps it would relieve
some of the tension out there

04:43.233 --> 04:46.002
if you'd just go out and talk to the team.

04:46.002 --> 04:47.337
Introduce yourself

04:47.337 --> 04:50.741
or just let 'em know
they're not all canned.

04:50.741 --> 04:53.677
Hmm. (speaks indistinctly) Parla inglese?

04:53.677 --> 04:57.677
Mm. Scusa. (speaks Italian)

04:57.948 --> 05:00.183
Scusi.

05:00.183 --> 05:01.718
(European accent) Yes, I speak English

05:01.718 --> 05:05.188
and French and Spanish
and German and Dutch.

05:05.188 --> 05:07.190
Well, do you have anything to say to us

05:07.190 --> 05:08.892
in any of your languages?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.296
This that you're wearing...
it's not suitable for an office.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.599
Apprennez un nouveau truc.

05:15.599 --> 05:17.601
Find another way to impress me.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.142
(scoffs)

05:25.142 --> 05:26.843
(laughs)

05:30.147 --> 05:31.748
So...

05:31.748 --> 05:33.717
this is where my husband came

05:33.717 --> 05:36.686
once a week for three years...

05:36.686 --> 05:40.323
and told you things about me, no doubt.

05:40.323 --> 05:43.293
I was glad to be there for your
family around Thomas' death,

05:43.293 --> 05:47.293
but I really think it would
be best if we try to move on.

05:48.265 --> 05:52.302
You know, no one in my family besides Tom

05:52.302 --> 05:56.239
has ever been to therapy.

05:56.239 --> 05:58.875
In fact, you're the only shrink I know.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.144
Is that what this is about?

06:01.144 --> 06:02.879
I can recommend someone for you.

06:02.879 --> 06:04.681
Oh, no. No.

06:04.681 --> 06:08.251
No, it's not for me.

06:08.251 --> 06:11.054
It's for Sam.

06:11.054 --> 06:12.622
He's falling apart.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.294
Well, I don't know anyone in Providence...

06:17.294 --> 06:18.995
He's not in Providence.

06:18.995 --> 06:21.131
He's here.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.133
Sam dropped out of college.

06:24.234 --> 06:27.237
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:27.237 --> 06:31.775
It would break Tom's heart
if he knew that his death...

06:31.775 --> 06:34.978
(sighs) has thrown Sam's life off course.

06:36.713 --> 06:39.850
I know an excellent local grief therapist.

06:39.850 --> 06:42.018
His name's Dr. Hansen.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.622
Thank you so much.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.825
Sam's just getting further
and further from my reach.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.293
Yesterday, he announced

06:50.293 --> 06:54.130
that he wasn't gonna
live in the house with me.

06:54.130 --> 06:58.768
He wants to move into Tom's
old apartment next week.

06:58.768 --> 07:00.937
Tom kept a place in town.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.939
Maybe he told you about it.

07:05.809 --> 07:09.112
Well, I don't know why he would've.

07:09.112 --> 07:12.249
It was for all those late work nights.

07:12.249 --> 07:15.118
It's a long drive home to Zuma.

07:19.723 --> 07:21.124
(elevator bell dings)

07:21.124 --> 07:24.127
(people speaking Indistinctly)

07:29.266 --> 07:30.901
Hi.

07:36.273 --> 07:37.941
Hey.

07:37.941 --> 07:39.276
Uh, hey, Dom.

07:39.276 --> 07:40.710
You're here.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.113
Oh, I've been here. You've been out.

07:43.113 --> 07:47.817
Yeah, I had court, and, uh,
depos to take all over town,

07:47.817 --> 07:49.286
and I had the longest week of my life

07:49.286 --> 07:51.187
on one car ride to Camarillo.

07:51.187 --> 07:53.924
- I've been calling you and calling you.
- I'm sure I called you back.

07:53.924 --> 07:56.860
Sullivan V. Sullivan got
moved up to next week.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.094
What?

07:58.094 --> 07:59.563
We got a new judge. He picked a new date.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.131
We're not really ready.

08:01.131 --> 08:04.067
Which is why I've been calling
you. Listen, don't panic.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.101
Not panicking.

08:05.101 --> 08:06.336
All right. We're not so far off.

08:06.336 --> 08:07.904
But no more off sites and house calls.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.906
Okay. Okay. I think I got it, Dom.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.976
Listen, a win in this case puts
us on track for partnership.

08:12.976 --> 08:14.578
I said I got it.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.112
Okay, so you're here then?

08:16.112 --> 08:18.081
- I'm here.
- Excellent.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.316
- Good.
- Pack your P.J.'s,

08:19.316 --> 08:23.787
'cause this is home for the next 150 hours.

08:25.855 --> 08:28.792
I can't do that right now.

08:28.792 --> 08:31.061
(chuckles) Look, you want to get caught up,

08:31.061 --> 08:32.629
it's gonna take some late nights,

08:32.629 --> 08:35.832
a... a lot of late nights.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.734
You all right with that?

08:51.642 --> 08:52.609
So Sam is moving in to your love nest?

08:52.609 --> 08:54.278
So what?

08:54.278 --> 08:58.225
What if I left something
there, some evidence of myself?

08:58.225 --> 09:01.494
Like what? Your camp towel
with your name sewn on it?

09:01.494 --> 09:04.531
I don't know. A credit card receipt?

09:04.531 --> 09:07.133
Sweetie, you remove your
own hair from your hairbrush

09:07.133 --> 09:09.135
every single time you use it.

09:09.135 --> 09:13.039
There is no way Karen
Kim left anything behind.

09:13.039 --> 09:14.040
You're right.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.543
You're right.

09:18.278 --> 09:20.313
How are you?

09:20.313 --> 09:22.349
How's being back at work?

09:22.349 --> 09:25.118
Terrible. And I have a week
of all night Cram sessions

09:25.118 --> 09:26.419
coming up with Dom.

09:26.419 --> 09:28.154
Oh, that's...

09:28.154 --> 09:29.489
Oh.

09:29.489 --> 09:32.459
Right? I mean, this is not
the moment in my marriage

09:32.459 --> 09:34.861
that I want to be crawling
into bed at 2:00 a.m.,

09:34.861 --> 09:36.363
smelling of Dom's cologne.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.564
Why would you smell...

09:37.564 --> 09:39.366
It wafts,

09:39.366 --> 09:41.401
then lingers.

09:41.401 --> 09:46.273
Savi, it's okay if you
have an attraction...

09:46.273 --> 09:48.141
I don't... I don't have an attraction.

09:48.141 --> 09:50.043
That's not what's happening.

09:50.043 --> 09:51.478
All I'm saying is, even
happily married people

09:51.478 --> 09:54.547
have chemistry with other people sometimes.

09:54.547 --> 09:56.516
It doesn't have to lead anywhere.

09:56.516 --> 09:57.517
I can't believe you're saying this to me,

09:57.517 --> 09:59.252
knowing what I've done.

09:59.252 --> 10:02.555
Well, I believe you when you
say you're not gonna do it again.

10:04.491 --> 10:06.993
I have to go.

10:06.993 --> 10:09.095
Thank you. Talk later?

10:09.095 --> 10:10.397
Sure. Of course.

10:10.397 --> 10:12.232
See you at April's tonight.

10:12.232 --> 10:14.301
What's going on at April's tonight?

10:14.301 --> 10:16.369
Shoot.

10:16.369 --> 10:18.038
Do you know that this is the longest

10:18.038 --> 10:21.174
I've gone in 20 years
without talking to her?

10:21.174 --> 10:23.376
Have you tried to reach out?

10:23.376 --> 10:27.247
Oh, five messages, two
e-mails, and an accidental text.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.416
Give her time, Savi.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.518
She's gonna come back.

10:33.486 --> 10:34.521
(kisses)

10:34.521 --> 10:35.422
Bye.

10:35.422 --> 10:36.856
Bye.

10:44.064 --> 10:47.067
Olivier Dubois is his
pretentious-ass name,

10:47.067 --> 10:49.135
not that he would deign to
tell me that information.

10:49.135 --> 10:52.205
I had steal it from his man
purse. Guy's clearly gay.

10:52.205 --> 10:55.241
That or he's European
with a European carryall.

10:55.241 --> 10:57.043
April, how do I put this?

10:57.043 --> 11:00.981
Olivier "Oblivier" to my many, many charms.

11:00.981 --> 11:02.349
Oh, I see.

11:02.349 --> 11:03.883
How am I gonna work with this guy?

11:03.883 --> 11:06.453
I had a system with
Mac, you know, a method.

11:06.453 --> 11:07.454
Mm. Rhythm?

11:07.454 --> 11:08.955
Funny.

11:08.955 --> 11:11.324
Well, at least you got a
grunt out of your caveman.

11:11.324 --> 11:13.159
I mean, Richard completely snubbed me.

11:13.159 --> 11:14.861
I mean, flat out snubbed me.

11:14.861 --> 11:16.363
What did you expect from the poor guy?

11:16.363 --> 11:18.431
You stood him up twice
without an explanation.

11:18.431 --> 11:20.533
Well, what was I supposed to tell him?

11:20.533 --> 11:23.370
On the way to our date, some
trash showed up on my doorstep

11:23.370 --> 11:26.039
with my cheating-ass
husband's biracial spawn?

11:26.039 --> 11:28.475
Don't forget the extortion.
This is heartbreaking stuff.

11:28.475 --> 11:30.110
I can't tell him any of it.

11:30.110 --> 11:31.478
You know, I don't know
him enough to trust him.

11:31.478 --> 11:33.947
His daughter is in Lucy's
circle of friends, for god sake.

11:33.947 --> 11:35.915
Well, you certainly can't make up a lie.

11:35.915 --> 11:37.417
You're a famously bad liar.

11:37.417 --> 11:39.386
I guess this guy's just gonna
have to think you're a bitch.

11:39.386 --> 11:41.087
- Ugh.
- (cell phone buzzes)

11:42.455 --> 11:45.258
Oh. Text from Olivier.

11:45.258 --> 11:46.926
What's it say?

11:46.926 --> 11:48.128
It says he's not gay.

11:50.497 --> 11:53.433
"meet me. 8:00 P.M. St. Gervaise hotel."

11:53.433 --> 11:56.069
Oh, that's disgusting.

11:56.069 --> 11:57.337
Oh, I knew he'd come around.

11:57.337 --> 11:58.304
(inhales)

11:58.304 --> 12:01.474
(exhales deeply)

12:02.974 --> 12:03.443
This isn't a divorce case.

12:03.443 --> 12:05.445
It's an imminent domain proceeding.

12:05.445 --> 12:07.347
Since when did the courts

12:07.347 --> 12:08.948
not care who screwed up the marriage?

12:08.948 --> 12:10.850
Yeah, the house in Aspen is worth 12,

12:10.850 --> 12:12.018
not 8, by the way.

12:12.018 --> 12:13.486
Ah, that's a subtle distortion.

12:13.486 --> 12:15.088
His appraiser's a Crook.

12:15.088 --> 12:16.589
And his lawyer's a jackass.

12:16.589 --> 12:18.324
Where'd he find him? Side of a bus?

12:18.324 --> 12:20.060
Mm.

12:24.264 --> 12:25.999
You didn't have to do that.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.567
Ah, I got some for myself.

12:27.567 --> 12:32.305
And I had 'em put your chili Pepper flakes

12:30.937 --> 12:32.305
on the side.

12:32.305 --> 12:34.040
Thank you. The thought of
anything spicy right now

12:34.040 --> 12:36.176
is not appealing to me.

12:41.414 --> 12:43.349
Um, notes on the settlement conference?

12:43.349 --> 12:45.418
Uh, I just saw them a couple minutes ago.

12:45.418 --> 12:47.320
- I got it.
- Is it under here?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.190
Okay, you know what?

12:50.190 --> 12:52.492
- You can't do that.
- What? What... what I'd do?

12:52.492 --> 12:54.260
What? What? Touch your hand?

12:54.260 --> 12:55.495
Touch my hand,

12:55.495 --> 12:57.063
buy me dinner,

12:57.063 --> 12:59.399
- flex your forearm.
- I did not flex my forearm.

12:59.399 --> 13:01.835
- You flexed your forearm.
- Okay, I didn't intentionally flex my forearm.

13:01.835 --> 13:03.403
I rolled up my shirt
because you insist on it

13:03.403 --> 13:05.305
- being, like, 78 degrees in here.
- You know what, Dom. Dom. Dom.

13:05.305 --> 13:08.541
Dom, forget it.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.076

13:11.911 --> 13:13.213
(clears throat)

13:13.213 --> 13:16.182
What is it you want?

13:22.422 --> 13:25.258
I want things to go back
to the way they were before.

13:25.258 --> 13:27.460
This is the way it was.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.529
Th... this is it. This is...

13:29.529 --> 13:31.397
this is us.

13:31.397 --> 13:35.502
Then it needs not to be.

13:35.502 --> 13:38.204
And how do you propose we make that happen?

13:42.342 --> 13:45.345
(bossa nova music playing)

13:56.122 --> 13:57.223
(clears throat)

13:57.223 --> 14:00.093
You did say 8:00.

14:00.093 --> 14:02.095
Yes. Mm. Asseyez-vous.

14:02.095 --> 14:03.229
Please sit down.

14:03.229 --> 14:05.131
(whispers) Thank you.

14:05.131 --> 14:06.466

14:06.466 --> 14:09.102
(normal voice) Yes. Uh, Beaujolais, please.

14:11.204 --> 14:14.174
Jesseline was the name of
my first girlfriend in Nice.

14:14.174 --> 14:16.976
Oh, you grew up in Nice, hmm?

14:16.976 --> 14:18.178
No.

14:18.178 --> 14:20.346
Hmm. (clears throat)

14:20.346 --> 14:22.048
Well, I'm really glad you texted,

14:22.048 --> 14:25.552
although I didn't really peg
you for a texting kinda guy.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.600
I think we can both agree

14:27.600 --> 14:30.336
we got off on the wrong
foot this morning, huh?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.171
Tell me something.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.273
Narrow the field.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.941
- Real estate.
- Oh. Go.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.876
Why is it you have twice as many properties

14:36.876 --> 14:39.112
as anyone else in the firm?

14:39.112 --> 14:41.614
I can't say I don't deserve them.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.516
And how did you come to deserve them?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.619
By being very good at my job.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.825
Well, you are good at
selling the easy ones.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.961
I sold two craftsmen in Eagle Rock

14:54.961 --> 14:56.329
over four days last month.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.097
Mm, as I said, easy.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.166
And the Bel-Air mediterranean?

15:00.166 --> 15:02.001
A gorgeous no-brainer.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.237
I am taking half of your accounts

15:05.237 --> 15:07.707
and redistributing them to the others.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.041
- What? Why?
- This property of yours

15:09.041 --> 15:11.844
has been on the market for over 12 months.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.312
(scoffs) On Wetherly above the strip?

15:13.312 --> 15:16.882
It's a bizarro, gaudy, unsellable house.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.952
Move it, and I'll give
you two properties back.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.689
Ah.

15:25.992 --> 15:29.195
You were right. The office was tense.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.765
I find it much more
pleasant doing business here.

Two weeks in Byron Bay?

No. No. I'm a widow.

23:26.982 --> 23:28.851
You snubbed a widow.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.756
Anyway,

23:33.756 --> 23:37.493
the contents of this package were...

23:37.493 --> 23:39.361
shocking to me,

23:39.361 --> 23:40.863
and as much as they made me question

23:40.863 --> 23:43.065
not only who my husband was as a person

23:43.065 --> 23:46.735
but... everything we had been to each other

23:46.735 --> 23:50.139
for the last 20 years...

23:50.139 --> 23:52.541
I just didn't want you to
think that I missed our date

23:52.541 --> 23:56.578
to watch "Mad men" and eat hot pockets.

23:56.578 --> 24:00.578
A big, confusing, and
painful thing happened.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.689
Okay then.

24:09.425 --> 24:11.593
Ready, girls?

24:11.593 --> 24:15.064
(laughs)

24:15.064 --> 24:17.599
Hey, daddy. Our routine is so awesome.

24:17.599 --> 24:19.601
Jane, I'll race you to the car. Come on.

24:19.601 --> 24:21.670
Come on, Jane! Hurry up!

24:24.773 --> 24:27.609
Hi, April. It's Savi.

24:27.609 --> 24:29.445
Uh, no pressure to call me back.

24:29.445 --> 24:33.716
I just wanted to call and let you know...

24:33.716 --> 24:35.484
uh, that I'm thinking of you

24:35.484 --> 24:37.853
and everything that you're going through,

24:37.853 --> 24:40.022
and, uh...

24:40.022 --> 24:42.458
well, I just didn't want
you to feel all alone.

24:42.458 --> 24:43.859
(knock on door)

24:45.394 --> 24:46.462
Okay.

24:46.462 --> 24:47.796
Bye. Hi.

24:47.796 --> 24:49.698
I didn't know where else to go.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.600
- Sweetie, what happened?
- I went to Tom's apartment.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.035
You what?

24:53.035 --> 24:55.804
When I was there, Sam came
in, but he didn't see me.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.139
Are you sure?

24:57.139 --> 24:58.741
Yes, I'm sure. I crouched
behind the counter.

24:58.741 --> 24:59.842
I know he didn't see me.

24:59.842 --> 25:01.410
Karen.

25:01.410 --> 25:04.546
You're right. I hadn't left anything,

25:04.546 --> 25:05.614
but now I have.

25:05.614 --> 25:07.416
- You left...
- My sunglasses on the table.

25:07.416 --> 25:09.618
They were right there on the
table, but he was coming in.

25:09.618 --> 25:12.654
I had to go. Oh!

25:12.654 --> 25:14.590
Wow.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.592
Uh, okay.

25:16.592 --> 25:20.429
Th... there's no way to connect
you to those sunglasses, right?

25:20.429 --> 25:22.464
I mean, it... they could be any woman's.

25:22.464 --> 25:24.533
I... I still think you're fine.

25:24.533 --> 25:26.969
It'll start him back on
his obsession. I know it.

25:26.969 --> 25:28.871
He'll start searching for the identity

25:28.871 --> 25:30.572
of Tom's mistress again.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.907
- I bet he didn't even stop.
- Yes, he did.

25:31.907 --> 25:33.909
I helped him stop.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.577
What?

25:36.645 --> 25:38.842
- I've seen him a few times.
- When?

25:38.843 --> 25:41.617
I needed to bring him some peace
about his relationship with Tom

25:41.617 --> 25:43.652
so he could put it all to rest.

25:45.421 --> 25:47.523
I don't know what to say to you anymore.

25:47.523 --> 25:51.693
Why do you continue to involve
yourself with these people?

25:56.365 --> 25:59.635
For the same reason I went
to that apartment today.

26:01.403 --> 26:04.740
The truth of it is...

26:04.740 --> 26:08.444
I'm not done with Tom.

26:12.915 --> 26:16.585
Karen, you know I love you.

26:16.585 --> 26:19.621
You have got to move on.

26:21.757 --> 26:23.959
Move on to what?

26:26.495 --> 26:27.996
(bells on door jingle)

26:27.996 --> 26:29.731
Don't say anything about the outfit.

26:29.731 --> 26:31.133
I just came from work.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.435
God, I swear it's like neck spanx.

26:33.435 --> 26:35.471
(jingles) Okay. Here are the photos

26:35.471 --> 26:39.007
of the weird-ass house I need to sell.

26:39.007 --> 26:41.477
- Hello? Can you help me?
- "Okay then"?

26:41.477 --> 26:43.045
Wow. Are we still on Richard?

26:43.045 --> 26:44.613
What does that even mean?

26:44.613 --> 26:46.548
"Okay then. I'll call you later"?

26:46.548 --> 26:47.649
"Okay then. I think you're lying

26:47.649 --> 26:48.750
and I can't stand the sight of you"?

26:48.750 --> 26:50.886
"Okay then. Sorry for your trouble"...

26:50.886 --> 26:52.421
See, that would've been nice.

26:52.421 --> 26:54.523
Wow. You really like him.

26:54.523 --> 26:56.592
I never heard you talk
like this about a guy.

26:56.592 --> 26:59.027
Probably 'cause I've only been
with one guy since high school.

26:59.027 --> 27:02.097
Oh, no, you've been with two,
actually... Paul and Paul's ghost.

27:02.097 --> 27:03.765
But thanks to Miranda,
you're free for the first time

27:03.765 --> 27:05.667
in your postpubescent life,

27:05.667 --> 27:08.370
and you must ask out this adorable Richard.

27:08.370 --> 27:09.838
Show me the house.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.373
Okay.

27:15.744 --> 27:16.778
This is it?

27:16.778 --> 27:17.813
Mm-hmm.

27:17.813 --> 27:19.882
But it's so...

27:19.882 --> 27:21.116
ugly.

27:21.116 --> 27:22.384
Mm.

27:22.384 --> 27:23.785
It's so odd.

27:23.785 --> 27:25.821
Some coked-up rock star owned
it and then reconstructed it

27:25.821 --> 27:27.489
the summer he decided to try smack.

27:27.489 --> 27:28.724
Oh, wait. What's that?

27:28.724 --> 27:29.725
Oh.

27:29.725 --> 27:30.959
That's a toilet.

27:30.959 --> 27:32.561
He has a toilet in the living room?

27:32.561 --> 27:33.695
Mm-hmm.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.965
I prefer to see it as a really artsy chair.

27:36.965 --> 27:39.868
So can you toss some
pillows, drape some fabric,

27:39.868 --> 27:41.637
home this place up a little bit?

27:41.637 --> 27:43.472
Josslyn, sweetie,

27:43.472 --> 27:45.607
I wouldn't make a dent.
I mean, that is more

27:45.607 --> 27:48.043
than a flannel throw away
from being inhabitable.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.511
Mm.

27:49.511 --> 27:51.547
You're right.

27:52.614 --> 27:54.750
You're right. Screw it.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.818
I'm not gonna try to make
this house something it's not.

27:56.818 --> 28:00.122
I'll embrace it for what it really is.

28:00.122 --> 28:02.524
How fast can you get a sitter?

28:14.002 --> 28:16.672
Hey.

28:16.672 --> 28:18.807
I thought you weren't coming in at all.

28:18.807 --> 28:21.443
Oh, I'm just catching up on a few things.

28:24.246 --> 28:27.816
Okay. Well, I have a... a
patient to fail miserably,

28:27.816 --> 28:30.252
so I'm gonna get back.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.687
Wait. Jacob?

28:31.687 --> 28:32.721
Yeah.

28:32.721 --> 28:36.721
Do you, you know, do things?

28:37.559 --> 28:40.529
I mean, after work?

28:40.529 --> 28:44.666
- Like solve crimes or...
- Do you have a social life?

28:44.666 --> 28:46.301
(laughs)

28:46.301 --> 28:49.705
You know, uh, a man of my stature

28:49.705 --> 28:52.107
could be insulted by that question, Karen.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.709
(chuckles) Yeah, of course I do.

28:53.709 --> 28:57.709
I have a standing, very
uncompetitive tennis game

28:58.647 --> 29:00.349
with my buddy Federman on Thursday.

29:00.349 --> 29:02.484
Sometimes we grab a beer after.

29:02.484 --> 29:04.453
Is that enough for you?

29:04.453 --> 29:06.655
Well, if I'm hungry, I get wings.

29:06.655 --> 29:10.092
How do your patients even talk to you?

29:10.092 --> 29:13.261
(laughs) Look, we're
workaholics, you and me.

29:15.364 --> 29:17.532
It changes tonight.

29:17.532 --> 29:19.568
My friend is having a thing.

29:19.568 --> 29:21.770
You think you'd want to come?

29:23.372 --> 29:25.107
Yeah.

29:26.208 --> 29:29.344
(whistles)

29:29.344 --> 29:30.445
Hi.

29:30.445 --> 29:32.147
Hi. Mm.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.415
Mwah. Bye. You gotta go?

29:33.415 --> 29:34.783
Yeah. See you there?

29:34.783 --> 29:38.153
Oh, and I, uh, I left
you something on the bed,

29:38.153 --> 29:39.855
for later.

29:41.723 --> 29:43.692
(doorbell rings)

29:52.134 --> 29:54.136
(whispering) What the
hell are you doing here?

29:54.136 --> 29:55.637
My husband was just home.

29:55.637 --> 29:57.406
You got me kicked off the Sullivan case.

29:57.406 --> 29:59.541
What are you talking about? No, I didn't.

29:59.541 --> 30:00.842
Don't. Don't... don't lie to me.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.844
Okay, Ron told me that
you came into his office...

30:02.844 --> 30:04.713
I told him to let you take it,

30:04.713 --> 30:06.815
that there were too many hands on deck.

30:06.815 --> 30:09.751
You knew how he wanted to play
this... male and female counsel.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.654
If he had to make a choice,
he's gonna choose you.

30:12.654 --> 30:15.490
Oh, my God. Dom...

30:15.490 --> 30:17.559
I didn't think about that.

30:17.559 --> 30:21.329
I didn't. I'm... I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

30:21.329 --> 30:24.232
I was just trying to make
things manageable for us.

30:24.232 --> 30:27.869
No, I'm managing just fine.
You're the one who can't deal.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.704
Look, screw me if you want to screw me,

30:29.704 --> 30:32.641
but don't do it like this.

30:47.222 --> 30:50.192
(indistinct conversations)

30:54.060 --> 30:55.761
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where are you going?

30:55.761 --> 30:56.829
No deck dancing.

30:56.829 --> 30:59.265
The deejay goes inside, near the...

30:59.265 --> 31:01.333
uh, fire pit.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.202
Kitchen people, where the hell's the food?

31:03.202 --> 31:06.739
Hey. Hey. It's not my
fault the oven's in the den.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.175
Who designed this monstrosity?

31:09.175 --> 31:11.777
Harry, I'm super grateful
for your services,

31:11.777 --> 31:13.479
but I need you to cut the trash-talking

31:13.479 --> 31:15.714
just a little bit if I'm
gonna sell this house tonight.

31:15.714 --> 31:17.083
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.118
I thought this was a cocktail party.

31:19.118 --> 31:21.153
Oh, it's a cocktail open house party.

31:21.153 --> 31:23.756
Sort of a Twilight preview, if you will.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.324
And how's this supposed to work?

31:25.324 --> 31:27.927
Show 'em a good time at a
soirée they wished they hosted

31:27.927 --> 31:30.796
at an awesome party house
that they wish that they owned.

31:30.796 --> 31:32.331
That sounds like a solid plan.

31:33.966 --> 31:37.236
No. Hey, guy, that's not a working toilet.

31:37.236 --> 31:39.271
Come on. It's in the middle of the room.

31:39.271 --> 31:42.274
Can't find good help to save my life.

31:42.274 --> 31:44.410

31:58.924 --> 32:02.761
I really thought he was valet.
Thank you for chasing him.

32:02.761 --> 32:04.296
No sweat.

32:04.296 --> 32:06.966
Wow. This is not the same
house I saw in the pictures.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.801

Hi, Joss! Joss, hi!

32:14.740 --> 32:15.875
Welcome to hipster hell.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.376
- The place looks great.
- Really?

32:17.376 --> 32:18.410
Any buyers?

32:18.410 --> 32:19.778
No one's biting on anything

32:19.778 --> 32:21.480
except for Harry's phenomenal free food.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.016
This is my colleague Jacob.

32:24.016 --> 32:25.784
- Oh, are you rich?
- Am I...

32:25.784 --> 32:27.820
do you want to buy this house?
It'll get you a lot of tail.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.188
Uh...

32:29.188 --> 32:30.956
(gasps)

32:30.956 --> 32:32.758
I can't believe he actually came.

32:32.758 --> 32:33.792
(Karen) Who?

32:33.792 --> 32:34.727
It's Olivier.

32:34.727 --> 32:36.028
(clears throat)

32:36.028 --> 32:37.463
(singsongy) You didn't
tell me he was gorgeous!

32:37.463 --> 32:40.799
Prepare yourselves to meet
the consummate cretin bastard.

32:40.799 --> 32:42.234
Oh, Olivier, hi.

32:42.234 --> 32:43.903
Miss Carver, buona sera.

32:43.903 --> 32:46.472
This is Geneviève, here from Paris.

32:46.472 --> 32:48.040
Geneviève.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.743
Oh, these are my friends...
April, Karen, colleague.

32:50.743 --> 32:54.747
A brilliant showcase of
the House's assets, Josslyn.

32:54.747 --> 32:56.282
- Thank you.
- An entertainer's dream.

32:56.282 --> 32:58.951
Mm. Please excuse us. Excuse me.

32:58.951 --> 33:00.953
Shall we?

33:00.953 --> 33:04.456
Did you, by chance, happen
to expense all of this?

33:04.456 --> 33:06.425
Oh, I'll see it back in spades.

33:06.425 --> 33:09.395
It's a big bet to lay
if it doesn't work out.

33:10.930 --> 33:13.265
It will make firing you that much easier.

33:13.265 --> 33:14.333
Mm.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.701
Bonne chance.

33:19.972 --> 33:22.007
The night's still young. Buck up.

33:22.007 --> 33:23.842
Oh, buck off.
