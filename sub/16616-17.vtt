00:01.543 --> 00:04.796
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.963 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:11.803
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:14.556
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:18.185
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:21.980
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:22.064 --> 00:23.607
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:25.067
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.000
Hey guys, I didn't know
you were coming to the church raffle.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.044
I will confess a mix-up to you.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.214
I thought Donna said
we were going to the church "waffle."

00:47.381 --> 00:50.008
And we're only here for
the fantasy weekend at Fenway Park.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.343
- Fenway Park?
- Oh, yeah!

00:51.426 --> 00:55.639
The winner and a friend get to hang out
and practice with retired Red Sox players,

00:55.722 --> 00:59.226
and then play in a real game
right on the field at Fenway!

00:59.309 --> 01:01.436
Oh, my God!
That's always been a dream of mine.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.606
Well, that, and tuning a guitar
in front of a live audience.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.756
This was in perfect tune
when they handed it to me.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.972
Next up, our fantasy weekend for two
at Fenway Park.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.307
Oh, man, this is it!

01:38.432 --> 01:39.850
And the winner is...

01:40.267 --> 01:41.476
Peter Griffin.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.353
- Holy crap, I won!

01:43.437 --> 01:45.105
- Wow, good for you!
- Congratulations!

01:45.314 --> 01:47.941
I like it when people
say your name out loud!

01:48.066 --> 01:51.361
How exciting, Peter!
A weekend trip to Boston!

01:51.445 --> 01:53.864
Yeah, and the best part is,
I don't even have to get on a plane.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.782
I always have trouble at the airport.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.704
Sir, you're not allowed
to be on the carousel.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.207
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have
named it such a fun word.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.251
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm not yours.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.128
He's stealing me. I'm being stolen!

02:08.253 --> 02:09.922
Excuse me, I think you've got mine.

02:11.507 --> 02:12.841
Oh, that's a good idea.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.643
- Oh, hey, Quagmire.
- Hey, Peter!

02:22.726 --> 02:26.438
So, I was just baking a coffee cake
and I figured I'd bring it over,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.524
- cause you like coffee cake.
- Wow, thanks.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.109
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
So, who are you taking to Fenway?

02:31.193 --> 02:32.528
- What?
- Well, I was just thinking,

02:32.611 --> 02:34.446
you have that extra ticket.
Maybe you'd wanna...

02:34.530 --> 02:36.073
Peter, before you answer him.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.868
I've got that murdered jogger's Discman
you wanted last week.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.495
Still bloody!

02:41.578 --> 02:44.540
Hi, Peter.
You know how you like 40 dollars cash,

02:44.665 --> 02:47.125
well, here's almost 40 dollars cash.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.836
Guys, look. I know you all want to go,

02:48.919 --> 02:50.921
but I need a little more time
to figure this out.

02:51.213 --> 02:55.217
I mean, it's a tough decision, like what
to do with that big watermelon I bought.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.678
Griffin, I just wanted to tell you...

02:59.096 --> 03:01.056
That's a great outfit. Keep it up!

03:01.890 --> 03:04.893
I knew it!
I have to start trusting myself more.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.980
Man, I don't envy you.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.523
Whichever one of them
you bring to Fenway,

03:09.606 --> 03:10.899
the other two will be mad at you.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.067
I don't wanna bring any of them.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.486
Those guys are all
way better than me at baseball.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.488
They'd just show me up and ruin it for me.

03:16.572 --> 03:17.739
Why don't you bring Lois?

03:17.906 --> 03:20.868
She doesn't care about baseball, and
that way nobody gets their feelings hurt.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.828
- Brian, that's a great idea!
- Thanks.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.873
Is it "new tennis ball" great?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.458
It's three new tennis balls great.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.585
I'm gonna get 'em all,
I'm gonna get 'em all,

03:29.668 --> 03:30.961
I'm gonna get 'em all!

03:38.010 --> 03:41.013
Mom, you're really going to Boston?
I didn't even think you liked baseball.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.349
Oh, I'm not going for baseball.
I'm going for shopping,

03:44.433 --> 03:48.604
the hotel spa, and two days of
being away from you life-sucking turds.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.858
Anyway, be good.
And while we're gone, Brian's in charge.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.443
Where is Brian?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.945
What's up, bitches?

03:57.613 --> 03:59.031
Oh, come on, Mom, really?

03:59.114 --> 04:02.492
I'm in high school and you're still
putting the dog in charge?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.871
Believe me, Meg, you want me in charge.
Stewie can be a bit of a handful.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.956
He's right, you know. I'm a total Taurus.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.291
Stubborn as they come!

04:09.583 --> 04:13.045
All right, fine. Meg, while we're away,
you can be in charge.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.297
Come on, Lois, time to get to Fenway!

04:15.464 --> 04:17.466
Wow, Dad, you look awesome,

04:17.549 --> 04:20.302
but I thought you
were gonna dress like a baseball player.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.764
I am, Chris. I'm the type of player
who arrives at the stadium in a suit,

04:23.972 --> 04:25.807
with a tie knot as big as an apple.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.143
That's how you know I got money.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.271
- All right, we'll see you guys Sunday.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.733
Okay, now you heard Mom
say I'm in charge.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.236
- So, I just wanna lay a few ground rules.
- Yup.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.987
I promise we're gonna have fun,

04:39.071 --> 04:40.280
- but there will be a schedule...
- Uh-huh.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.490
...just to keep everything

04:41.573 --> 04:42.658
- running smoothly.
- Gotta have boundaries.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.742
And I may assign a chore or two because...

04:43.825 --> 04:44.993
That's great, Meg.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.496
- ... it's more fun if everyone pitches in.
- Sounds like you got it worked out.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.122
- Hey, by the way...
- Ahh!

04:49.748 --> 04:51.542
I'm gonna flush your retainer
down the toilet.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.271
Look at this, Lois.
The Fenway Park locker room.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.939
All right, Peter, I'm gonna go.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.776
You wanna hand me some cash in front of
the other men so you feel powerful?

05:17.860 --> 05:21.196
Instead, why don't you take
my Minions Discover card.

05:21.864 --> 05:25.200
Hey there, sluggers.
Welcome to Red Sox Fantasy weekend.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.204
Well, who's this? We've never had
a lady come out for this before.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.248
Oh, no, that's my wife.
She's just dropping me off.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.959
Yeah, you're nice, but I'm not staying.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.086
I don't know the first thing
about baseball.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
Look, your spot's already paid for.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.175
And besides, if you leave,
the teams will be lopsided.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.345
So, as your coach, I insist you stay
and play with us. Right, fellas?

05:46.847 --> 05:50.392
Well, I don't know.
What do you think, Peter?

05:50.559 --> 05:53.770
What do I think about sharing
Fantasy Baseball Camp with my wife?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.398
Yeah, come on, let her play!

05:56.481 --> 05:59.651
Wow! 1980s All Star, Wade Boggs!

05:59.943 --> 06:02.446
Hey, would you mind
standing next to a star of today?

06:02.529 --> 06:03.572
Sure.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.325
Man! What happened to our game?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.535
David Ortiz, will you
pick him up like a baby?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.287
It's your weekend!

06:11.705 --> 06:15.042
Now, let me put this baby bonnet
on his head and a cigar in his mouth.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.379
So, what do you say?
Are you gonna let your wife play?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.840
Absolutely. Lois, stay here and play
with us.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.259
I can't say no to baby Boggs.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.427
Cutchi-cutchi...

06:25.552 --> 06:26.678
Ah, he bit me!

06:36.396 --> 06:38.357
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm here.

06:38.607 --> 06:42.110
Lois, see that wall there?
They call that the green monster.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.614
And over there is where I threw
a D cell battery at Jose Canseco.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.574
All right, let's play ball.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.702
Wow! You must be excited, Peter.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.622
Yep, guess I can cross this one
off my bucket list.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.792
All that's left now
is living the Pueblo lifestyle.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.712
Peter, what the hell
did you do to the house?

07:01.129 --> 07:04.466
I know it seems pretty lame,
until you realize I'm 58.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.594
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go lick the foot of

07:07.678 --> 07:10.430
a fleshy, pale woman for <i>Real Sex 34.</i>

07:16.395 --> 07:18.730
Rupert, what do you think
of this fan fiction I wrote?

07:18.897 --> 07:21.316
"Diego pressed Dora against the wall,

07:21.400 --> 07:25.070
"her bosom heaving,
her hot Latina breath on his face.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.699
"For once,
Diego was going to do the exploring."

07:29.408 --> 07:30.534
Just reading it!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.452
<i>Muy caliente!</i>

07:32.536 --> 07:34.580
Okay, Stewie, time for you to get dressed.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.416
Yeah, close door means "Come in," I guess.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.793
What the hell do you think you're doing?

07:39.877 --> 07:43.672
Let's pick out a cute shirt for you.
Then, I thought we can go to the park.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.342
Or, how about this? I press my butt
against the wall and duke on it.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.429
Stewie, don't do that!

07:50.512 --> 07:52.973
You're messing with my schedule,
so I'm giving you wall poop.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.391
- Stop that right now!

07:55.017 --> 07:56.518
You just earned a time-out.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
A what? Let go of me!

07:58.312 --> 07:59.479
Don't you walk away!

07:59.563 --> 08:01.940
Hey, don't bruise me.
I'm going dancing later.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.984
You listen to me, you little monster.

08:04.067 --> 08:08.322
I take abuse from everybody around here.
But, I am not gonna take it from you!

08:08.530 --> 08:10.365
Now, sit here until I say you can get up.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.828
And if you move one muscle before,
then I'll smack you in your weird head.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.540
Hey, it's not weird!
Mom says it's distinctive.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.551
Griffin, you're up.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.223
It's always the fat one.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.184
- I heard that.
- I said it right to you!

08:37.309 --> 08:40.687
You know what? Let's just
get Lois up to bat. Where's Lois?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.606
I'm right here, coach.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.275
Guess you don't have
a lot of babes out here.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.653
Except for Babe Ruth.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.739
- Babe Ruth!
- Ha!

08:50.822 --> 08:52.032
That's funny 'cause she's hot.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.913
Ah! It's a little like tennis.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.916
Did you see that, Peter? I'm doing it all!

09:01.250 --> 09:03.877
Damn it!
This was supposed to be my weekend.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.015
Stewie, what the hell's going on?

09:17.099 --> 09:18.267
Meg's awful!

09:18.392 --> 09:21.019
She gave me a time-out
and she made me sit in this chair.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.146
My god, she put eye shadow on you, too.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.315
I might have gotten up from the chair.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.318
Brian, Meg's lost her mind.
You've got to talk to her.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.571
Stewie, Lois put Meg in charge.

09:30.779 --> 09:34.491
And honestly, once I knew that,
I ate a pot cookie, so, um...

09:34.616 --> 09:35.617
Yeah.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.327
So, good luck with all that.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.455
- You got any cool DVDs?
- Brian, please, I need help.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.583
Totally! Hey, where's Chris?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.626
I wonder if he'll play Wii Bowling
with me.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.712
All right, that's it.
I'm not just gonna sit here

09:46.795 --> 09:48.463
and see what that psycho does next.

09:48.839 --> 09:49.923
All right, think.

09:50.132 --> 09:54.511
Ah! I shall fashion a makeshift ladder
with my diaper genie entrails,

09:54.720 --> 09:56.805
shimmy down to the yard, and I'm free!

09:57.389 --> 10:01.643
The trick, Chris, is thinking of the wand
as an extension of your arm.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.189
Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling
with a dog on drugs!

10:08.609 --> 10:09.818
Ah! Son of a bitch!

10:13.488 --> 10:14.907
Oh, my god! A baby!

10:15.032 --> 10:17.576
My name is Shelly.
I can't have any of my own.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.662
Would you like to come home with me?
I love you so much!

10:20.829 --> 10:22.706
Argh! Everywhere's a nightmare!

10:34.718 --> 10:37.679
Wow! It's nice they put on
a banquet for you.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.723
But it looks like I'm the only woman here.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.226
Yeah, they're ex-athletes,
which means they're all divorced.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.521
In fact, their ex-wives are having
a banquet next door with their money.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.985
Oh, they're having fun.
They're doing a lot of "pointing" dancing.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.491
At least somebody's
having fun here tonight.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.202
Oh, you're just nervous
about the big game tomorrow.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.829
Is it 'cause of how pink you turn
when you run?

11:02.913 --> 11:05.165
A couple of guys mentioned that today
on the field.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.293
- What? Who said that?
- I don't know. Nomar-something...

11:08.377 --> 11:09.503
You met Nomar?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.213
Hey! There you are!

11:11.296 --> 11:14.550
We've been saving a spot at the head table
for you with all the hall of famers.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.553
Oh, thanks!
Finally, something's going my way.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.137
- Where should I...
- Not you.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.931
- Lois.
- What?

11:24.142 --> 11:28.063
This is the one night of the year
they let me out of the scoreboard.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.275
Oh, I don't know if I deserve
to sit at the head table.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.653
No, no! We took a vote.
We all wanna sit next to you.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.405
You're the only one here who doesn't have

11:36.488 --> 11:38.490
a fist full of baseball cards for us
to sign.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.660
I wasn't gonna have 'em sign them.
I was just gonna tell them their stats.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.620
But, this is Peter's weekend.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.205
Ah, don't worry about Peter.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.290
Now, come on, Lois.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.083
We've got you sitting right between

11:48.166 --> 11:51.170
Pedro Martinez and
Ted Williams' severed head.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.297
There's a special place in hell

11:53.422 --> 11:55.799
for whoever's responsible
for me ending up like this.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.558
Hey Meg, is anybody going to eat
this grilled cheese?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.227
No, don't eat that. That's Stewie's lunch.

12:07.436 --> 12:11.690
Oh, my god! Stewie! I forgot,
he's been in a time-out for six hours!

12:13.775 --> 12:14.776
Stewie?

12:15.277 --> 12:19.364
Oh, no! Where is he? He's gone!
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.658
I tried to tell you
watching Stewie wasn't easy.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.330
Oh, man! This is terrible.
Stewie could be anywhere.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.305
Sorry, I forgot my jacket.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.688
Okay, everybody,
we're gonna do some double play drills.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.775
Oh, yeah. Little infield.
Let's flash some leather, huh, guys?

12:54.858 --> 12:56.902
- Who wants to play second?
- I will.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.196
Lois, why don't you take second?

13:00.197 --> 13:03.492
How could he not see that?
I even held up my arm with my other hand!

13:03.659 --> 13:05.911
That is the most noticeable way
to raise your hand.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.330
Okay, Griffin, you go out there
and be the base runner.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.333
All right, Peter, show 'em what you got.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.210
Okay, Lois, catch the ball,

13:13.293 --> 13:16.922
and if your foot comes off the bag,
just tag Peter on any part of his body.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.342
How could I miss, right?
It'll be like tagging a barn!

13:22.594 --> 13:25.097
Sorry, Peter. That's baseball.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.892
I'll show you baseball,
you sexually unsatisfied wife.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.024
Oh!

13:45.367 --> 13:46.368
Yeah!

13:46.618 --> 13:48.662
Now that's a big league slide, huh, coach?

13:48.745 --> 13:49.746
Ahh!

13:49.913 --> 13:51.582
Damn it, I think it's broken!

13:51.832 --> 13:53.584
Griffin, what are you, an idiot?

13:53.792 --> 13:57.421
Yeah. An idiot who's gonna
show up on <i>SportsCenter</i> tonight.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.716
Coming up after the break, we'll have
highlights of the playoff game between...

14:00.883 --> 14:02.217
Streaking. Unrelated.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.394
Yep, her leg is fractured.
We should get her to the hospital.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.022
My only medical training
is to say "Walk it off."

14:15.272 --> 14:16.899
- Can you walk it off?
- No!

14:16.982 --> 14:20.986
Oh, well, that's not good. Okay, I'm gonna
go fake-use the phone in the dug out.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.280
Peter, what the hell got into you?

14:23.405 --> 14:25.866
Nothing. I was just trying
to play hard like Pete Rose.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.076
Look, I can even do the Pete Rose haircut.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.830
I bet you a 1000 bucks
I have a drinking problem.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.832
Guys, we gotta get that leg set.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.417
I guess I should ride in the ambulance.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.252
You think I'll be back in time
for the game?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.546
What? You're not playing in the game.

14:39.630 --> 14:43.258
It's supposed to be a fun day out here,
and you go nuts and break your wife's leg.

14:43.509 --> 14:46.762
Well, it's not my fault. I'm all hopped up
on hard baseball card gum.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.227
Mmm.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.354
It's like eating a MasterCard.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.980
Let's get her out of here.

14:58.524 --> 15:01.276
And you, you're done.
Clean out your locker!

15:02.611 --> 15:05.197
Kicked out? I'm totally screwed.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.825
Like those poor guys who had to come up
with a new ad campaign for Subway.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.955
Hey, I'm Mike. I like sandwiches
and people my own age.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.749
<i>Subway.</i>
<i>Please don't think of pedophilia.</i>

15:23.257 --> 15:24.800
You know what I'm getting sick of saying?

15:25.133 --> 15:27.845
"My husband did this to me,
but it's not what you think."

15:28.178 --> 15:30.472
Please forgive me, Lois. I'm so stupid.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.474
The reason I didn't bring my friends

15:32.558 --> 15:34.393
is 'cause I didn't want 'em
hogging the spotlight.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.229
And then when I saw everyone
giving you all that attention,

15:37.646 --> 15:39.022
I guess I kinda lost it.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.315
You did a little.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.110
But, of course I forgive you.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.779
I just don't understand
why you went so crazy.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.992
Well, ever since I was little,
I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid

15:50.075 --> 15:51.493
that nobody wanted on their team.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.162
And I was excited,
that for one weekend, if I could just

15:54.246 --> 15:56.832
step on that field
and get a hit at Fenway Park.

15:57.249 --> 16:00.752
I could erase all that and feel like
a champ for the first time in my life.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.964
But, I'm not a champ. I'm a fat loser.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.175
No wonder nobody ever picked me.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.679
I picked you, Peter.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.141
And to me and our kids,
you will always be a winner.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.685
Thanks, Lois. And you know what?

16:16.852 --> 16:20.898
If that's true, I don't need to play
in some stupid Fantasy Baseball game.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.024
Well, guess what?

16:22.107 --> 16:23.192
You're gonna play in that game,

16:23.275 --> 16:24.526
and you're gonna get that hit.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.571
And when you do,
we're all gonna be there to cheer you on.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.240
Really? Well how's that gonna happen?

16:30.365 --> 16:33.827
Peter, these guys have been sexually
harassing me since the second I got here.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.705
Either you play, or every one
of these Red Sox are going to jail.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.582
Even Ted Williams.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.461
Mmm. New meat.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

16:42.878 --> 16:46.006
This is the number one fear
of only being a head.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.972
Brian, do you always listen to
the SiriusXM preview station?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.641
Yeah, I'm thinking about pulling
the trigger,

16:55.724 --> 16:57.309
but they make you sign like a two year...

16:57.392 --> 17:00.812
Guys, who cares about your dumb radio?
We can't find Stewie anywhere!

17:02.439 --> 17:03.440
- Hello?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.067
Oh, hi, Mom.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.070
Hi, honey. How you doing? How's Stewie?

17:08.278 --> 17:12.282
Oh, he's great. Not lost or anything.
How's fantasy camp going?

17:12.658 --> 17:14.660
Uh, your father broke my leg out
of jealousy.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.579
But that didn't ruin our honeymoon,
and it's not gonna ruin this.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.959
So listen, I want all you guys to
drive up to Boston this afternoon,

17:22.042 --> 17:23.752
to see your father play in the big game.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.214
Wow. We'd love to, Mom.

17:27.422 --> 17:32.386
But, we promised Stewie we'd perform
a puppet show for him later today.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.389
Oh, you can perform it
for all of us up here in Boston.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.392
The game's in two hours. Drive safely.

17:38.851 --> 17:42.020
Crap! Now we gotta find Stewie
and write a puppet show.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.275
We could repurpose my one-act farce.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.861
Or, we could write something fresh.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.780
Well, just because it's already been
written doesn't mean it's not fresh.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.074
What did I just say? Shut up!

17:54.157 --> 17:56.535
We're in trouble. I'm in trouble!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.871
Hey, what's this? A dickweed convention?

17:59.288 --> 18:01.540
- Stewie!
- Oh, thank God, you're home!

18:01.623 --> 18:02.875
Where the hell have you been?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.085
As far away from her as possible!

18:05.294 --> 18:07.379
- I forgot her name, honestly.
- Who? Meg?

18:07.462 --> 18:09.631
Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean,

18:09.715 --> 18:11.633
and I don't ever want her
to be in charge of me.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.677
Are you afraid of me, little guy?

18:14.344 --> 18:18.098
Oh, Stewie. I'm really sorry
I left you in that time-out.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.685
I love you very much
and I'm so happy you're home.

18:21.977 --> 18:24.813
You're my little brother.
Can you forgive me?

18:25.814 --> 18:27.858
Well... All right.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.033
- Can I have your baby?
- Don't let her in!

18:44.166 --> 18:46.835
We're all proud of you, Peter.
Now don't be nervous.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.170
I ain't nervous, Lois.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.088
I'm just sweating
'cause I was too embarrassed

18:50.172 --> 18:51.548
to get nude in the locker room

18:51.632 --> 18:53.342
so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.260
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

18:55.344 --> 18:59.389
<i>now batting for the Boston Red Sox,</i>
<i>Peter Griffin.</i>

19:17.324 --> 19:19.701
Fair ball. Run, Peter! Run it out!

19:24.206 --> 19:25.624
- Peter's brain.

19:25.707 --> 19:29.169
Yeah, this is the muscle department.
What the hell is he doing?

19:29.253 --> 19:31.547
Uh, apparently he's trying to sprint.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.174
Sprint? He got winded walking
to the plate!

19:34.258 --> 19:36.510
And he's been out
in the blazing sun for two days!

19:36.718 --> 19:38.178
Has he had any water?

19:38.262 --> 19:41.223
No. He told his wife
there's juices in the hot dogs.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.477
Well, I'm sorry. I got no choice but
to call for a complete muscle failure.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.736
Look!
Dad's planking from like eight years ago.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.572
Is there a Neiman Marcus in Boston?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.616
Peter! Get up! Get up and run!

20:01.410 --> 20:02.911
- Run, Peter!
- Come on, Dad!

20:03.078 --> 20:04.246
We love you!

20:04.329 --> 20:05.914
Copley Place. How far is that?

20:16.508 --> 20:18.552
<i>I ran like a champion that day.</i>

20:18.844 --> 20:22.514
<i>Pushing through the pain of</i>
<i>two torn hamstrings and a ruptured groin.</i>

20:22.598 --> 20:26.059
<i>A leg out to hit at Fenway Park,</i>
<i>I had always dreamed of.</i>

20:27.644 --> 20:28.770
<i>But, nobody noticed.</i>

20:28.854 --> 20:31.940
<i>'Cause the account manager from B of A</i>
<i>who was playing third base</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:35.110
<i>had a massive coronary</i>
<i>trying to field my crappy little number.</i>

20:36.111 --> 20:37.613
<i>The hit was amazing!</i>

20:37.988 --> 20:39.198
<i>But what made it even better,</i>

20:39.448 --> 20:42.284
<i>was that my family was there</i>
<i>to share the moment with me.</i>

20:42.409 --> 20:43.744
<i>And on the car ride home,</i>

20:43.952 --> 20:46.455
<i>they put on a puppet show</i>
<i>that made me laugh so hard</i>

20:46.538 --> 20:48.749
<i>I crashed into a toll booth on</i>
<i>the Mass Pike,</i>

20:49.124 --> 20:51.293
<i>totaling the car</i>
<i>and breaking Lois' other leg.</i>

20:52.294 --> 20:53.712
<i>The casts kinda smell,</i>

20:53.795 --> 20:55.964
<i>so I won't let her</i>
<i>sleep in the bedroom till they're off.</i>

20:56.507 --> 20:57.883
<i>But, that's baseball.</i>
