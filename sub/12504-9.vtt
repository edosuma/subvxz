[Payson] Previously on:
Make It Or Break It.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.411
I've had three cortisone
shots this year.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.180
My mom won't let me
have another one.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.547
I could score it for you.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.050
Goodbye, Marty.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.453
- Kaylie.
- You and Marty?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.255
[Kaylie] You lost your
virginity? With who?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.124
Just some guy I met.
I didn't know him.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.593
You want to break me and Kaylie
up, it's not gonna happen.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.561
[Lauren] I'm trying to help you
do the right thing.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.497
- Can I borrow your cell phone?
- Yeah.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.432
[cell phone ringing]

00:31.465 --> 00:33.401
- What is this?
- [Carter] Mr. Cruz...

00:33.434 --> 00:35.503
You stay the hell out of this.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.538
All she wants is to please you.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.340
- Hey, listen.
- Don't push me.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.076
You get the hell
out of my house.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.444
Carter, I love you.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.314
You're a liar.
I will never be with you.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.182
Who did you borrow a few
thousand dollars from?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.183
- Joe.
- We moved to Frisco

00:49.217 --> 00:51.352
- to get away from Joe.
- He's not coming back.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.221
He just wired us the money.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.322
[cell phone rings]

00:54.355 --> 00:55.356
Joe. Where are you?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.191
[knock at door]

01:02.496 --> 01:03.497
[gasps]

01:04.365 --> 01:06.100
What time is it?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.368
Six.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.502
Oh...

01:09.437 --> 01:10.471
Thank God.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.643
I was having a dream
that we overslept...

01:15.676 --> 01:20.648
...and Sasha kicked you
out of the gym again.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.451
Sasha's the least
of our worries.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.353
[giggles]

01:25.386 --> 01:27.555
I just remembered
another part of my dream.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.292
Oh, sorry...

01:31.325 --> 01:33.461
How did you sleep?

01:33.494 --> 01:37.198
Not so good with you trying
to spoon me all night.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.301
You used to want to sleep
with me all the time.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.536
When I was six.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.307
I seem to recall you slept with
me until you were at least ten.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.542
Oh, no. You were
with Joe when I was ten.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.444
And then he left
when I was 11.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.547
Then you took him back when
I was 12 and then he left again.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.684
Then you took him back again
and we had to leave the city
to get away from him.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.153
And now...

01:59.187 --> 02:01.555
...he's in the living room
sleeping in my bed.

02:01.589 --> 02:05.226
He's just passing through
on his way to Dallas, honey.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.595
[Joe] Good morning.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.300
We've got eggs and bacon
and pancakes.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.703
The cupboards were a little
spare so I went out and did
some grocery shopping.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.506
And for our world class gymnast,

02:18.539 --> 02:20.174
I've got an egg white omelet

02:20.208 --> 02:23.177
with spinach, tomato
and fresh fruit.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.319
Traitor.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.321
Hey, I was hungry.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.556
Half-caf, with just
a touch of cinnamon,

02:35.589 --> 02:38.559
one sugar and just
a drop of cream.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.493
You remembered.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.495
I haven't forgotten a thing.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.334
Neither have we.
What time are you leaving?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.602
Dallas is pretty far away.
You should get on the road.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.204
Emily, don't be rude.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.473
No... It's OK.
She's under a lot of pressure.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.475
She's going to Nationals.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.444
I always knew you
were a superstar.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.481
Is that why you never
came to any of my meets?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.616
- Emily.
- Well, it's true.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.653
Know what? You all can play
nice but I'm out of here.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.490
Oh, thanks for the loan, Joe.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.394
We'll pay you back every cent.
I don't want to owe you a thing.

03:13.427 --> 03:18.699
[rock music]

03:18.732 --> 03:23.571
Hey. I thought for sure after
last night your dad would have
you in a chastity belt.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.772
Practically.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.408
He took away my phone,
my computer

03:27.441 --> 03:29.443
and made my mom
drive me to practice.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.345
He just wants you
to focus for Nationals.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.382
How can I can focus when I
can't even talk to Carter?

03:34.415 --> 03:37.651
So you haven't spoken to him
since last night at the party?

03:37.685 --> 03:40.354
- No.
- Know what you guys?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.790
Nationals are three days away.
I don't have time for drama.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.627
Is that your stump speech
for Team Captain?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.763
Because it's just so full of
support, Payson. Thank you.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.532
I'm supposed to support
your gymnastics.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.268
Not your running around
breaking the rules.

03:54.302 --> 03:58.706
That's easy for you to say
seeing as though you've never
broken a rule in your life.

03:58.739 --> 03:59.707
By the way...

03:59.740 --> 04:01.309
How's the back?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.703
My back's awesome.
Thanks for asking.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.841
So, how did your night turn out?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.343
It sucked.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.677
They won't let her talk
to Carter.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.713
[Kaylie] But, at least
I can still see him.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.350
If he'd get here already.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.623
[Kim] Excuse me. Hey.

04:49.657 --> 04:53.727
So, how's Kaylie this morning?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.563
Miserable.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.564
And angry.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.099
And, of course, she hates us.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.534
Of course.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.571
Yeah, but she's 16,
and her heart is breaking.

05:03.604 --> 05:07.775
I don't understand why
the girls aren't allowed
to have boyfriends anyway?

05:07.808 --> 05:11.812
Well, I think the idea is
to prevent this kind of drama.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.082
But between you and me,

05:15.115 --> 05:19.353
I don't know if this no
dating rule hurts or helps.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.755
You're lucky Payson's
so focused.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.492
That has issues of its own.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.361
Not the kind that comes with
your husband getting punched

05:27.395 --> 05:29.397
by a teenage boy
in your living room.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.903
Thank you for not telling Sasha
what happened last night.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.672
What he doesn't know...

05:38.706 --> 05:40.608
What do you think
he'd do if he did?

05:40.641 --> 05:41.909
I don't know.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.779
[Sasha] It has
come to my attention

05:45.813 --> 05:48.782
that you have had an
inappropriate relationship

05:48.816 --> 05:50.418
with one of my gymnasts.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.755
My source didn't reveal
the name of the girl,

05:54.788 --> 05:56.624
so I'm going to ask you.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.658
Who is she?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.616
[Sasha] I've
recently been informed

06:22.650 --> 06:26.420
that the no dating rule has been
broken by two of your teammates.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.656
My source refused to name
the girl involved.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.826
But just in case you were
wondering how seriously
I take these rules...

06:32.860 --> 06:35.429
The boy involved,
Carter Anderson,

06:35.463 --> 06:37.698
is now suspended from The Rock

06:37.731 --> 06:39.700
and he won't be going
to Nationals.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.569
- That's all.
- [crowd gasping, murmuring]

06:41.602 --> 06:44.204
What? This is so unfair.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.974
He can't suspended Carter
three days before Nationals.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.842
At least Carter
didn't out you too.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.612
- Maybe it's better this way.
- How is it better?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.716
I'm not letting him take
all the blame. No way.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.187
Ladies?
Can you gather round?

07:00.220 --> 07:01.989
Don't be a martyr.
He can sit out this year.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.991
- He's only 18.
- She's right.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.292
Men don't even peak
until their 20s.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.928
He's got the next two
quadrenniums to make it
to the Olympics.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.597
We've only got 0-12.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.600
This is the team rankings
by apparatus for Nationals.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.468
You still need to choose
your team captain.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.836
We're knocking off early
tomorrow

07:15.869 --> 07:18.872
because I want you
to get home, get packed
and get to bed early.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.775
Ten hours every night
minimum before competition.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.678
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.680
Kaylie?

07:26.714 --> 07:28.649
Is there something
you want to say?

07:29.717 --> 07:30.651
No.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.754
Sir.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.656
All right then.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.707
What?

07:53.741 --> 07:54.642
Nothing.

07:54.675 --> 07:58.712
You obviously have
something to say so...

07:58.746 --> 08:02.650
Was it really necessary
to kick Carter out of the gym?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.685
The girls need to be protected.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.855
With all due respect,
they are young women.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.624
You are always telling me

08:10.658 --> 08:14.662
that I have to come to terms
with the fact that my daughter
is not a normal teenager.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.797
- And that she has a career...
- Yeah?

08:16.830 --> 08:20.968
Well, how can we give them
responsibility for something
as huge

08:21.001 --> 08:23.070
as a professional
athletic career,

08:23.103 --> 08:27.675
and not give them responsibility
for basic decisions about their
life?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.878
- Well...
- Excuse me, Coach Belov.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.946
Why is Lauren ranked
first on beam?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.649
Because with her added degree
of difficulty, she's as good
as you now.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.317
But not better.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.687
You said I was going first
for everything.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.323
Payson, the goal at Nationals
isn't just to win individual
medals.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.693
It's for as many of your
teammates as possible
to make the National Team.

08:45.726 --> 08:50.564
If the top ranking on beam
helps Lauren get there,
you need to be supportive.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.832
I'm incredibly supportive.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.101
When you feel secure at the top.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.905
It's easy to be gracious when
you think no one can touch you.

08:57.938 --> 09:02.976
You know, I assumed
you were going to be
Team Captain this year.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.746
But maybe you're
not up to the job?

09:17.825 --> 09:18.659
What now?

09:18.692 --> 09:21.595
I thought your title was coach,
not God.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.610
Guess what?

09:36.644 --> 09:40.681
Sasha just ranked Lauren
first on the beam.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.850
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

09:47.688 --> 09:51.124
Did my daughter just
smile and wave to you?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.761
Did the seas part
while I was gone?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.829
It wasn't quite
that miraculous.

09:55.863 --> 09:59.733
But I think Lauren's finally
got that I'm on her side.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.769
What did you do to convince her?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.706
I told her...

10:07.007 --> 10:08.909
...that I wasn't
going to marry you.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.178
You were, bluffing, right?

10:11.912 --> 10:12.913
No.

10:15.983 --> 10:20.954
I can't marry you Steve if it
just reinforces Lauren's fear
of abandonment.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.056
I'm not going to
abandon Lauren.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.825
I'm not talking about you.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.727
I'm talking about her mother.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.195
She needs some closure.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.898
Well, that's impossible.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.967
Her mother's a drug addict and
I have no idea where she is.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.670
I do.

10:36.704 --> 10:40.708
I did an internet search
for Leslie Tanner...

10:40.741 --> 10:43.210
It only took me about
20 minutes to find her.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.813
So I'm guessing
you never really looked.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.683
Honey, I have my reasons
for wanting her to stay
away from Lauren,

10:49.717 --> 10:51.952
and frankly, it's
none of your business.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.959
Maybe you're right,
but it is Lauren's.

10:58.992 --> 11:03.430
And I think she has the right
to know where her mother is.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.066
You know where my mother is?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.268
[rock music plays]

11:18.011 --> 11:18.979
[music stops]

11:19.012 --> 11:20.213
I was listening to that.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.015
Yeah, so were the Smitts

11:22.049 --> 11:23.150
halfway down the street.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.785
OK, you're angry.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.854
- We get it.
- No, Mom, you don't get it.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.756
And that's the problem.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.091
I spoke with Carter today.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.461
What? When?

11:34.494 --> 11:36.864
He was waiting for me
outside the gym.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.800
He wants to see you.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.801
What did you say?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.771
That I would help you.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.738
Oh!

11:44.772 --> 11:46.039
Thank you, mom.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.041
Thank you.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.914
Listen, I'm doing this
because I do understand.

11:53.947 --> 11:58.051
But after you see Carter you
need to focus on Nationals.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.754
- OK?
- OK. When can I see him?

12:00.788 --> 12:04.524
Tomorrow. You can slip out
of the gym on my watch.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.760
But only for a few minutes.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.929
If your father finds out
he's gonna kill us both.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.798
Yeah.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.933
- OK?
- OK.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.135
Finish packing and get
a good night's sleep.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.169
OK.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.507
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

12:20.540 --> 12:23.343
Are you ever going to
tell Dad about Marty?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.782
I, um...

12:28.816 --> 12:29.850
I don't know.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.152
Well...

12:32.185 --> 12:34.822
Maybe it's better
if he never knows.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.762
I'll see you in the morning.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.769
[video game gunfire]

12:53.373 --> 12:55.208
Oh!

12:55.242 --> 12:56.243
[door opens]

12:58.846 --> 13:01.014
There she is.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.992
So, I'm taking it she didn't
exactly warm to the idea
of me staying another night?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.393
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to her.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.565
At least you don't hate me.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.901
That's because I don't
expect anything from you.

13:20.934 --> 13:24.037
So when you leave
you never disappoint me.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.243
But he's buying Brian
a ticket to Nationals.

13:30.277 --> 13:34.114
Oh, so if he buys his way
back in, then it's OK?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.616
Honey, don't you want
your brother to go?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.919
More than anything in the world.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.189
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to have Brian at Nationals,

13:42.222 --> 13:45.392
except watch Joe
suck you back in again

13:45.425 --> 13:49.963
so I have to pick you up
off of the floor after he
breaks your heart.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.932
That's not going to happen,
Honey.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
He hasn't changed.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.369
But I have.

13:56.403 --> 14:01.041
Whether you want to see that
or not, I think I deserve
a little more credit.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.344
Your credit rating sucks.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.417
I have to go to sleep.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.986
We leave for Nationals
the day after tomorrow.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.090
He's gonna leave tomorrow,
sweetie.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.992
I promise.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.963
Please don't spoon me tonight.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.086
[knock at door]

14:49.722 --> 14:50.924
Come in.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.096
How are you doing?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.365
Fine.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.441
Look...

15:08.475 --> 15:11.478
I've known where your
mom was for a while.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.948
But I was afraid...

15:14.982 --> 15:18.485
...that if we let her back
into our lives she'd just...

15:18.518 --> 15:20.453
Uh...

15:20.487 --> 15:23.223
...disappoint you again
like she did so many times

15:23.256 --> 15:26.693
when you were
a little girl.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.096
- I'm not a little girl anymore.
- Yeah, well...

15:29.129 --> 15:32.232
Even when you're 40
you'll still be my little girl.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.234
I'll be old is what I'll be.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.970
Hey, 40 is not old.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.107
Anyway...

15:40.140 --> 15:43.410
Summer seems to think that
you're old enough to decide

15:43.443 --> 15:45.979
if you want to give
your mom another chance.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.248
So...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.418
That's your mother's
phone number.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.419
Hey.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.255
I'll never abandon you, Lauren.

15:55.288 --> 16:00.460
Even if I do marry Summer you'll
always come first in my heart.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.961
I hope you know that.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.562
[phone ringing]

16:36.563 --> 16:39.299
Mom?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.601
It's me, Lauren.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.539
[rock music]

16:46.573 --> 16:48.408
* I'm looking for something

16:48.441 --> 16:51.544
* But I end up with
nothing instead *

16:51.578 --> 16:55.048
* I think I'm better off dead

16:56.349 --> 16:58.585
* And I feel it inside

16:58.618 --> 17:01.354
[groans, sighs]

17:01.388 --> 17:02.589
You want to talk about it?

17:03.623 --> 17:04.624
No.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.461
Guess what?
My mom's coming to Nationals.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.563
I thought your mom was
doing work in Darfur?

17:10.597 --> 17:13.233
She's back and she's flying
into Denver this afternoon.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.501
I'm picking her up
from the bus station.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.237
- That's great Lauren.
- I know.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.206
She hasn't seen me compete
since I was eight.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.374
She's going to be
really proud of you.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.544
I know. Especially now that
I'm ranked number one on beam.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.480
I should get back to work.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.150
It's weird we've been
friends all these years

17:30.183 --> 17:31.618
and I've never
met your mother.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.387
Well, you will now.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.459
You sure you don't
want to talk about it?

17:40.327 --> 17:41.394
Positive.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.202
Nice. How'd that feel?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.184
Why did you let Sasha
kick you out of The Rock?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.352
I didn't have a choice.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.653
You could have
told him about me.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.155
So we could both get suspended?

18:08.188 --> 18:11.558
He's not going to suspend one
of his top four gymnasts before
Nationals.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.393
Yeah, well, you don't know that.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.629
Yeah, well, if you're not going
to Nationals neither am I.

18:16.663 --> 18:20.267
- What about your gymnastics?
- I don't care about gymnastics.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.136
Baby.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.340
I just want to be with you.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.611
You're the only person in
the world I can believe in.

18:31.644 --> 18:35.148
Just hold me
and never let me go.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.653
Listen to me.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.455
Let's run away.
Right now.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.491
- I can't let you do this.
- I want to do this.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.627
Look. You can believe in me.
You can.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.563
But I made a mistake.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.300
- I don't care.
- Listen to me.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.602
It was after we fought
at the kegger.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.171
We said we were
gonna play it cool.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.606
Which...

18:59.639 --> 19:01.341
...doesn't make it OK.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.346
What did you do?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.952
I had sex with someone else.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.654
I'm so sorry.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.688
Don't!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.474
[Chloe] Hey!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.209
What are you doing home?

19:36.243 --> 19:39.246
Sasha let us go early.
Why aren't you at work?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.214
Um...

19:41.248 --> 19:44.217
I, I was, but I didn't have
any clients this afternoon...

19:44.251 --> 19:45.518
Where's Joe?

19:46.553 --> 19:47.554
Joe?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.657
Oh, my God.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.259
Is he in there?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.595
Did you sleep with him?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.500
Emily, I didn't know that you
were coming home. I'm sorry.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.336
- You're sorry you got caught.
- Don't talk to her like that.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.337
Stay out of this!

20:04.371 --> 20:06.639
You're not my father
and you're not her husband.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.241
You have no authority here.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.278
Listen, Emily.
I love your mother.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.380
That is the biggest joke
I've ever heard.

20:13.413 --> 20:17.750
If you love my mother
then how come you left
her so many times?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.286
It's complicated.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.787
It's simple.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.523
You are a loser.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.593
And she's too weak
to kick you out on your ass.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.595
- Emily...
- No.

20:28.628 --> 20:32.265
You can screw up your life
all you want, but you're
done screwing up mine.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.635
- Emily?
- Just let her go.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.669
She'll cool off.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.541
She's wrong.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.009
I know.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.412
No, not about you.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.447
About me.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.349
I've changed.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.783
So have I.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.019
Chloe.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.455
When you called the other
day to ask me to help you,

20:55.488 --> 20:59.392
it didn't scare me
or freak me out.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.827
It made me happy.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.596
I want to take care of you.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.799
And for the first time in
my life I know that I can.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.637
I want to believe you.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.472
Don't you love me, Chloe?

21:12.505 --> 21:14.741
I do, but I love them more.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.678
Please, just go to Dallas
and let me be the mother
they need me to be.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.580
The mother that I need to be.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.349
Please?

21:45.372 --> 21:48.375

Oh! Hey!

22:36.656 --> 22:38.925
- Hey, Mrs. Keeler.
- Don't you look cute.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.527
- Thanks.
- Come on in.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.862
- Is Payson here?
- They're in the kitchen.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.633
Hey, I thought you went to the
bus station to pick up your mom?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.435
She couldn't make it.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.637
She got sent back to Darfur.

22:50.670 --> 22:54.774
- Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
- It's cool.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.375
Her work's important.

22:58.445 --> 22:59.646
So, what are you doing here?

22:59.679 --> 23:00.813
Emily's spending the night.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.915
Uh, Lauren,
have you heard from Kaylie?

23:02.949 --> 23:04.684
No, why?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.553
She snuck out of the gym
to go see Carter

23:06.586 --> 23:08.988
and I guess they had a fight
cause now no one can find her.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.892
So do we know what
they fought about?

23:12.925 --> 23:15.562
- Nope. And I don't care.
- Payson.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.631
It's selfish of her to freak
everybody out the night before
we leave for Nationals.

23:18.665 --> 23:22.702
Over some stupid fight she had
with a boyfriend she's not
allowed to have.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.970
[Kim] The point is,

23:24.003 --> 23:28.508
she is missing and
everyone is worried.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.710
If you guys have any idea
where she might be,

23:30.743 --> 23:33.446
it's up to you
as her friends

23:33.480 --> 23:36.616
and her teammates to make sure
she's on that bus tomorrow.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.719
I have to pick up Becca.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.755
Lauren you're welcome to join us
all for dinner tonight.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.824
- Thanks, Mrs. Keeler.
- Sure, honey.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.026
- Bye girls.
- Bye.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.597
Kaylie ran away.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.799
- What?
- Listen to this.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.701
[Kaylie] Hey, Lo...

23:54.734 --> 23:56.703
It's me. I'm, um...

23:56.736 --> 23:59.472
It doesn't matter where I am.

23:59.506 --> 24:03.576
Look, I don't know what I'm
doing, but I'm not going to
Nationals.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.744
- [bell rings]
- [man] And they're off!

24:04.777 --> 24:06.879
Tell everyone not
to worry about me.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.516
Has she lost her mind.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.618
It sounded like she was
calling from a payphone.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.620
Her dad took away her cell.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.021
What was that noise
in the background?

24:15.054 --> 24:17.624
Let me listen to it again.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.860
If you were Kaylie and you were
upset, where would you go?

24:20.893 --> 24:22.595
Other than Carter's truck?

24:22.629 --> 24:23.462
[man] And they're off!

24:23.496 --> 24:25.665
It sounds like she's
at the horse races.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.034
I doubt she'd be at a track.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.970
Is there anywhere that makes
her feel happy or safe?

24:31.003 --> 24:32.639
She loves the mall.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.807
[man] And they're off!

24:34.841 --> 24:36.543
- Gymnastics camp.
- What?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.744
Remember that general store
in Wintertown?

24:37.777 --> 24:41.047
We'd stash up on magazines and
candy before we went to camp?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.883
That guy would always be
listening to the races on TV.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.652
She went to camp.
Let's go get her.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.688
Get out of here.
It's three hours away.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.790
And Sasha said we need
to get ten hours of sleep.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.793
You're going to let her not go
to Nationals because of a fight
she had with Carter?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.528
Exactly.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.462
She's being ridiculous.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.599
And if she wants to ruin
her career let her.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.735
Fine. Get your beauty sleep.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.839
Are you in?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.978
We can't let Kaylie
miss Nationals.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.767
[Lauren] There's her car.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.779
See? Aren't you glad you came?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.783
Yeah, three hours in the back
of a car is great for my back.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.752
I thought you said
your back was fine?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.587
Let's just get Kaylie
and go home.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.355
We might still be able to make
eight hours of sleep.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.325
Hi, Mrs. Cruz? It's Lauren.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.993
We found Kaylie
at gymnastics camp.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.731
- OK, I will.
- OK, so...

26:04.764 --> 26:06.799
We found her car
but where is she?

26:06.833 --> 26:09.068
I know where.

26:30.823 --> 26:35.361
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

26:35.394 --> 26:38.097
We just drove three hours
to come get you, you better
talk about it.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.866
Hey, give her a break.

26:45.137 --> 26:48.107
Carter told me he had sex
with someone else.

26:51.811 --> 26:52.812
Did he say who?

26:55.081 --> 26:57.383
I didn't ask, but...

26:57.416 --> 27:00.653
He said it was after we fought
at the kegger so...

27:00.687 --> 27:03.990
I'm guessing it was with
some slut at the party.

27:04.023 --> 27:07.694
Was everyone having sex
at that kegger?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.798
Well...

27:11.831 --> 27:14.801
You saw Carter at the party
after we left.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.936
Was he with someone?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.810
Oh, my God.

27:23.843 --> 27:24.944
It was you.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.682
The guy at the party you
lost your virginity to?

27:29.716 --> 27:30.783
It was Carter?

27:30.817 --> 27:31.951
I'm sorry.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.689
I was drinking and it was
my birthday and I was upset...

27:36.723 --> 27:38.925
So you slept with my boyfriend?

27:38.958 --> 27:41.027
You kept telling everyone
he wasn't your boyfriend.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.795
You knew he was.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.898
I can't believe you. How can you
act like you're my best friend?.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.800
- I am your best friend.
- No!

27:47.834 --> 27:50.269
You are a two-faced slut.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.773
I can't even look at you.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.708
Hey, wait! Wait!

27:55.742 --> 27:57.744
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.746
No. No more running away.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.749
- Give me my keys.
- I'm not chasing you.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.484
We leave for Nationals
in the morning and we all
need to get home and sleep.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.787
You think I'm gonna go
to Nationals with her?

28:07.820 --> 28:08.788
[Payson] Fine.

28:08.821 --> 28:12.191
If you want to blow your
career over some boy,

28:12.224 --> 28:14.060
- Go ahead.
- OK. Wait!

28:14.093 --> 28:16.796
Like it or not,
we are in this together.

28:16.829 --> 28:20.099
And you are not gonna screw
me out of the only team
I've ever been a part of.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.868
We're all screwed
if we don't go home.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.136
So just give Kaylie
her keys and let's go.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.072
I want my keys, Emily.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.139
You want your keys?

28:29.776 --> 28:31.477
What the hell
is wrong with you?

28:31.510 --> 28:32.912
- We still have Lauren's car.
- Come on.

28:32.945 --> 28:36.849
No. If we're not leaving here
as a team we're not leaving here
at all.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.187
Are you both crazy?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.756
You just stranded us
in the middle of nowhere.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.092
[Emily] You guys have been
training together for ten years.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.194
Are you really gonna
just throw this all away?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.996
When we've come so close?

28:50.029 --> 28:53.199
She threw it all away when
she slept with my boyfriend.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.804
Payson, do have your phone?

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
I left it at home.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.873
Lauren?

29:02.041 --> 29:04.844
No. My battery's dead.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.046
Great.
What are we going to do?

29:07.079 --> 29:10.349
Look for our keys.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.521
We can stay here all night,

29:15.554 --> 29:20.960
but if you think I'm ever
going to forgive you...

29:20.993 --> 29:22.761
...you really are crazy.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.202
Thanks.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.839
I'm not on your side.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.841
You betrayed your best friend.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.443
I've fought too hard
to get to this place,

29:37.476 --> 29:41.213
and I'm not walking into
Nationals without the three
best gymnasts at The Rock.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.891
Oh, hey! Come on in.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.292
OK, we're all here.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.793
Hi.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.830
- Has Lauren called again?
- No.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.198
Her phone's going straight
to voice mail,

29:59.231 --> 30:03.235
but last time she called
she did say her battery
was about to die.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.272
When I told them to go
find Kaylie if they
knew where she was,

30:06.305 --> 30:09.075
I had no idea she
was three hours away.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.077
Don't worry.
They'll be home soon.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.511
This is all my fault.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.614
I never should have let Kaylie
sneak out of the gym to go see
Carter.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.816
You knew what she was doing?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.386
[stammers] I set it up.

30:23.222 --> 30:26.893
I thought it would help her
focus if she could say goodbye
before Nationals.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.061
I didn't know they'd get in
a fight and she'd run away.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.396
I think it was wrong of Sasha

30:30.429 --> 30:33.165
to kick Carter out of the gym
in the first place.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.402
Wait. Sasha kicked him out?

30:36.435 --> 30:39.071
Suspended. But now he
can't go to Nationals.

30:39.105 --> 30:43.309
I wonder who would tell Sasha
that Carter was dating one
of the girls?

30:45.444 --> 30:46.845
I did.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.847
I didn't say who.

30:48.881 --> 30:52.018
Do you really think that's
any of your business, Summer?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.285
Kaylie's my daughter.

30:53.319 --> 30:57.189
Your daughter wasn't the only
one Carter's been involved with.

30:59.058 --> 31:02.194
I think it's going
to be a long night.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.264
[Emily] I'm starving.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.434
[Lauren] I think I have an
energy bar. We can all split it.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.438
We could all be eating dinner
if you hadn't thrown our keys
and stranded us here.

31:12.471 --> 31:16.275
We wouldn't even be out here
in the first place if you
hadn't run away from home.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.344
No one asked you
to come find me.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.879
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.650
I don't want anything that
came from her skanky bag.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.052
Yeah.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.419
My bag's a whore.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.457
Fine, I'll eat yours.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.660
- Thanks for sharing, Payson.
- What?

31:34.693 --> 31:37.196
Am I supposed to split
her forth into threes?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.098
You could have given it
to someone else.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.367
I mean, if you're supposed
to be Team Captain

31:41.400 --> 31:44.370
you might want to think of
somebody besides yourself.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.306
Like you thought about
your best friend before
you slept with Carter?

31:47.339 --> 31:49.441
We weren't best friends
at the time.

31:49.475 --> 31:53.212
And if you would've been honest
about seeing Carter this never
would have happened.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.014
Oh, wow.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.116
Is that how you're going
to justify what you did?

31:57.149 --> 31:59.718
- By blaming me?
- Of course not.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.988
Because Kaylie Cruz can lie

32:02.021 --> 32:06.325
and break the rules and stab
her best friend in the back
and it's all OK.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.094
What are you talking about?

32:08.127 --> 32:11.230
You knew I had a crush on Carter
since I was 13 years old.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.300
He kissed me right here at camp.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.403
But you weren't thinking
about my feelings when
you went after him, huh?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.239
- I thought you were over it.
- Did you?

32:20.272 --> 32:23.242
Or is that the reason you kept
it a secret to start with?

32:23.275 --> 32:27.046
Because you knew
how much I liked him?

32:31.117 --> 32:34.086
OK, let's not forget it's
her fault that we lost Marty.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.388
It was Marty's choice
to go to Denver.

32:36.422 --> 32:40.759
No it wasn't.
He only went because your
father was blackmailing him.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.761
- That's ridiculous.
- [Payson] No, it isn't.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.530
I never believed Marty
would walk out on us.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.564
What do you know?

32:50.136 --> 32:52.404
Why would my dad
blackmail Marty?

32:52.438 --> 32:55.241
Because Marty was
sleeping with my mom.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.415
[Summer] I'm sorry I even
said anything to Sasha.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.484
I didn't know it would
have a snowball effect.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.187
Well if Alex finds out that
Carter's cheating on Kaylie

33:08.220 --> 33:09.788
he will go ballistic.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.157
[chuckles]

33:11.190 --> 33:12.558
- What?
- What?

33:12.591 --> 33:13.592
Nothing.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.495
- What?
- Well, nothing.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.431
It's just that there's a lot
that Alex is in the dark about.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.100
[Ronnie] Enough, already.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.569
It's been a rough week and
a long day and I'm over it.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.038
OK?
What is it you think you know?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.373
What do you mean?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.441
You're always making
little comments. OK?

33:29.475 --> 33:31.310
If you have something
to say just say it.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.181
Well, it's not something you
want the world to know, is it?

33:35.214 --> 33:37.516
What? That I had
an affair with Marty?

33:39.418 --> 33:43.489
There. Now I don't have
to suffer your little
innuendos anymore.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.557
You do know what "innuendo"
means, don't you?

33:45.591 --> 33:49.428
Now if only I didn't have to
suffer your constant insults
we'd be even.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.597
Mm-hm.
Thanks, Chloe.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.633
You had an affair with Marty?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.640
Is that why he went to Denver?

34:03.542 --> 34:07.213
I'm a terrible person.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.448
I admit it.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.384
And the worst part about it
is that Kaylie knows.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.624
I'm not proud of it.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.859
We've all done things
we're not proud of...

34:20.892 --> 34:22.528
At least I have.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.597
No. We all have.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.467
We're not judging you.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.403
Well, maybe you should.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.507
Cause I'm judging myself.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.510
You also need
to forgive yourself.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.847
But I've hurt my husband,
and I've hurt my children.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.617
How do you ever forgive
yourself for that?

34:45.651 --> 34:49.255
You can do what I do.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.489
Ask God to help you.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.528
[Emily]
That's really messed up, Kaylie.

34:56.562 --> 34:57.529
[Kaylie] Yeah.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.098
You have no idea.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.438
I'm ashamed of my own mom.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.113
If it's any consolation...

35:17.516 --> 35:18.584
...my mom's a drug addict.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.666
I thought your mother
was a relief worker?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.603
That's just what we
started telling people

35:37.636 --> 35:40.572
to explain why she was
always out of town.

35:40.606 --> 35:44.476
The truth is, she was in and out
of half a dozen rehabs.

35:44.510 --> 35:48.414
Just kind of became our
dirty little family secret.

35:48.447 --> 35:52.551
One day she just dropped out,
hit rock bottom.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.387
She never came home.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.324
Didn't you just speak
with your mom?

35:58.357 --> 35:59.525
I did.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.629
She said she's been
two years sober,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.498
how sorry she was, and...

36:06.532 --> 36:09.435
...how she couldn't wait to
come and see me at Nationals.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.506
When I went to the bus station,
she wasn't there.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.610
[Lauren] You're lucky, Pay.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.645
Your mom...

36:20.646 --> 36:22.614
She's such a mom.

36:22.648 --> 36:28.220
I feel like you could tell her
anything and she'd understand.

36:28.254 --> 36:31.223
I can't tell her I bought
cortisone illegally.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.224
What?

36:32.258 --> 36:35.594
My parents don't want me
to take anymore, but...

36:35.627 --> 36:38.697
I don't think I can make it
through Nationals without it.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.499
Where did you get it?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.501
It's from a doctor.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.771
- Indirectly.
- You need to rest your back.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.773
I will after Nationals, but...

36:49.275 --> 36:51.377
...if I don't make the
National Team this year

36:51.410 --> 36:53.379
I can kiss 0-12 goodbye.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.648
I can't just give up my dream
of going to the Olympics.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.684
It's...

36:58.717 --> 37:02.354
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

37:02.388 --> 37:06.792
It's my entire life.
It's everything I am.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.661
I know what she means.

37:09.695 --> 37:13.465
When Sasha told me I couldn't
go to Nationals, I thought
I would just...

37:13.499 --> 37:15.434
...crumble into nothing.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.269
Yeah.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.338
Yesterday he told me
I wasn't being gracious.

37:19.371 --> 37:23.642
That I'm not acting
like a team captain.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.710
He's right.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.680
I'm freaked out
because I'm scared.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.681
You?

37:29.715 --> 37:31.650
Scared?

37:31.683 --> 37:33.419
Terrified.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.023
I mean, you guys all know

37:38.056 --> 37:41.327
how much we need each other to
go out there and do what we do.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.561
But...

37:42.594 --> 37:46.732
You're all wrapped up
in boys and drama and...

37:48.734 --> 37:51.470
I don't feel like
I have you guys anymore.

37:53.472 --> 37:58.344
I'm sorry, Pay. I'm just going
through a lot right now.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.480
Me too.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.449
We've all been
going through a lot.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.484
But Payson's right.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.653
Are you going to let some boy

38:07.686 --> 38:13.359
or family drama blow
everything you've worked
for your whole lives?

38:14.560 --> 38:18.296
What if we were a football team,
would any guy ever do that?

38:18.764 --> 38:19.598
[Payson] It's just...

38:19.631 --> 38:22.601
We aren't like
normal girls, you guys.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.671
We can't just stop
talking to each other

38:25.704 --> 38:30.409
and change lockers or
cliques every other week.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.645
We are so much more
than just friends.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.849
We're a team.

38:37.883 --> 38:42.588
And I'm really sorry I've been
such a bitch lately, but...

38:42.621 --> 38:44.289
I really need you guys.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.661
You can count on me.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.397
Thanks, Emily.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.666
And me.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.485
And me.

39:21.893 --> 39:25.831
Hey, do you guys remember
when we carved our initials
into one of these tree stumps?

39:25.864 --> 39:27.533
Oh, yeah.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.535
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

39:29.568 --> 39:30.802
- Has to be around here.
- Yeah.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.804
[* Alexa Wilkinson:
Lullaby Appetite]

39:32.838 --> 39:34.506
[Kaylie] Um...

39:36.442 --> 39:37.509
Oh! Here it is.

39:38.777 --> 39:39.945
Can you still see our names?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.747
Oh, totally.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.649
And O-12.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.552
Remember when you
made us pledge...

39:46.585 --> 39:48.787
[Lauren] To the almighty
Goddess of Gymnastics...

39:48.820 --> 39:51.957
That we would all go to
the 0-12 Olympics together.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.425
Yeah.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.993
As the mighty triad.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.432
Anyone have a knife
or something sharp?

40:00.466 --> 40:01.967
I thought we were good?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.735
[all chuckling]

40:03.769 --> 40:06.738
I think Emily needs to carve
her name into our stump.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.576
Yeah.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.677
I think that's a good idea.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.613
The mighty quadruplets.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.748
[all laugh]

40:17.716 --> 40:18.884
Well...

40:20.586 --> 40:22.721
We could always use...

40:22.754 --> 40:24.022
...these.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.459
- Are those my keys?
- [Emily] Come on.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.595
I'm not stupid. I threw my
house keys into the woods.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.598
Oh, and actually,
I just remembered.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.466
I have a hide-a-key
under the bumper.

40:34.500 --> 40:38.236
- OK. You better start carving.
- Before we kill both of you.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.505
Yeah.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.878
* See me on that stage

40:46.912 --> 40:49.615
* Step up and sing

40:49.648 --> 40:50.982
Look, I'll be your teammate.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.654
But I will never
be your friend again.

40:58.524 --> 41:02.694
* To be closer to you
all the time, oh *

41:02.728 --> 41:08.734
* Fill my lullaby appetite
With a song *

41:08.767 --> 41:12.671
* That grows with time *

41:12.704 --> 41:16.608
Where are they? They called
from Wintertown five hours ago.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.243
Yes, but they said they
were gonna stop and eat.

41:18.276 --> 41:22.047
Don't you think it's a bit of a
coincidence they both lost their
keys in the woods?

41:22.080 --> 41:24.883
And they both found
their keys in the woods?

41:24.916 --> 41:27.653
What do you think Sasha
would say if he knew?

41:27.686 --> 41:29.821
- Knew what?
- [Chloe] Just...

41:29.855 --> 41:32.591
...how excited the girls
are to be going to Nationals.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.560
Speaking of the girls,
where are they?

41:36.294 --> 41:37.596
[rock music]

41:37.629 --> 41:38.797
Ah, there they are.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.733
* Start a new day

41:43.569 --> 41:45.937
* Let yourself go

41:48.039 --> 41:51.743
* Cause your head
seems to know this is right *

41:51.777 --> 41:54.746
* But your heart isn't sure

41:56.748 --> 42:00.952
* And crash like a wave

42:00.986 --> 42:05.824
* 'Cause a wave
needs to crash *

42:05.857 --> 42:09.728
* Don't be afraid,
just get on the train *

42:09.761 --> 42:14.800
* Take it right
off the tracks *

42:14.833 --> 42:17.736
* And never look back

42:19.705 --> 42:21.740
Well, you look ready
for Nationals.

42:21.773 --> 42:22.741
[Payson] We are.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.043
And regarding Team Captain?

42:25.076 --> 42:28.747
I would like to nominate
Emily Kmetko.

42:30.716 --> 42:33.719
You want the newest girl
on the team to be Captain?

42:33.752 --> 42:36.154
- [Payson] That's the point.
- I second that.

42:37.723 --> 42:38.724
Here, here.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.993
Uh, OK. Great.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.962
Now, can we please
get this show on the road?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.734
[Chloe] Can you believe
my Emily's going to be
Team Captain?

42:48.767 --> 42:49.768
Get over here!

42:55.373 --> 42:58.176
* Start a new day

42:59.845 --> 43:03.048
* Let yourself go

43:04.816 --> 43:08.620
* 'Cause your head
seems to know this is right *

43:08.654 --> 43:12.057
* But your heart isn't sure

43:13.659 --> 43:17.629
* And crash like a wave

43:17.663 --> 43:22.668
* 'Cause a wave
needs to crash *

43:22.701 --> 43:26.171
* Don't be afraid,
get on the train *

43:26.204 --> 43:29.708
* Take it right
off the tracks *

43:31.409 --> 43:34.680
* And never look back

43:35.881 --> 43:39.017
* And never look back *
