01:59.628 --> 02:00.962
Good morning...

02:05.634 --> 02:06.384
I’m Dr. Jung.

02:07.552 --> 02:08.887
I admitted you yesterday.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.183
I’m not...

02:14.226 --> 02:16.645
I’m not mad, you know.

02:20.482 --> 02:22.275
Let me explain what I have in mind.

02:23.652 --> 02:28.698
I propose that we meet here, most
days, to talk for an hour or two.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.617
Talk?

02:31.201 --> 02:32.035
Yes.

02:32.077 --> 02:33.203
Just talk.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.540
See if we can identify
what’s troubling you.

02:37.749 --> 02:42.462
So as to distract you as little as possible,
I’m going to sit there, behind you.

02:42.504 --> 02:47.300
I’m going to ask you to try not to turn around
and look at me under any circumstances.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.347
Now...

03:05.735 --> 03:09.823
Have you any idea what may have brought
on these attacks you suffer from?

03:11.116 --> 03:12.033
Hu...

03:15.954 --> 03:17.998
humiliation.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.129
Any kind of...

03:25.130 --> 03:28.258
humiliation.

03:28.300 --> 03:33.305
Like, I can’t bear to see it and
it makes me feel nauseated.

03:33.346 --> 03:38.101
I start pouring with sweat, cold sweat.

03:39.728 --> 03:40.310
My...

03:40.311 --> 03:40.896
my...

03:43.523 --> 03:52.407
my father lost his temper all the time.
He was always angry with me.

03:57.787 --> 04:02.542
When you stopped talking just now,
did a thought come into your head?

04:04.878 --> 04:05.545
I...

04:05.546 --> 04:06.880
I don’t know...

04:06.922 --> 04:09.090
Or an image, perhaps.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.051
Was it an image?

04:11.092 --> 04:12.344
Yes.

04:14.095 --> 04:15.013
What was the image?

04:16.723 --> 04:19.351
It was a hand.

04:19.392 --> 04:19.935
My...

04:19.976 --> 04:20.435
my...

04:20.476 --> 04:24.022
my father’s hand.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.815
Why do you think you saw that?

04:29.277 --> 04:31.029
Whenever he would...

04:33.949 --> 04:34.699
after...

04:34.741 --> 04:35.534
whenever he...

04:39.371 --> 04:42.332
he hit us, afterward we...

04:42.374 --> 04:45.877
we had to kiss his hand.

04:49.548 --> 04:55.679
What’s odd is that case I was writing up last
week, I happened to pick the codename Sabina S.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.931
And here she is... Sabina Spielrein.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.725
Quite a coincidence.

05:02.018 --> 05:04.145
As you know, I don’t believe
there is such a thing.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.775
Spielrein’s not a very Russian name.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.194
No, Jewish.

05:11.236 --> 05:14.948
Father’s a very successful
import-export man.

05:14.990 --> 05:18.910
And she’s exceptionally well
educated, speaks fluent German.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.788
Aspires to be a doctor herself, apparently.

05:22.706 --> 05:23.832
Perhaps she’s the one.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.042
What one?

05:26.084 --> 05:27.793
The one you’ve been looking for.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.838
For your experimental treatment.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.173
The talking cure.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.885
You’re so astute.

05:34.926 --> 05:37.804
I’ve already begun it with her.

05:39.723 --> 05:40.557
He’s kicking.

05:40.599 --> 05:42.100
Can you feel?

05:44.853 --> 05:45.687
Oh, yes.

05:45.729 --> 05:47.063
There he is.

05:49.774 --> 05:53.268
What I don’t understand is
why Freud, having proposed

05:53.269 --> 05:56.827
this radical therapeutic idea,
this talking cure, this

05:56.828 --> 06:00.257
psychoanalysis, then lets
years go by without giving

06:00.258 --> 06:03.622
even the barest outline of
his clinical procedures?

06:03.663 --> 06:04.956
What’s he playing at?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.667
Presumably he uses the
method on his patients?

06:07.709 --> 06:09.419
I’ve no idea.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.964
So might you be the first
doctor to try this out?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.049
It’s possible.

06:15.133 --> 06:16.676
Why don’t you write and ask him?

06:17.552 --> 06:18.512
I don’t know him.

06:20.847 --> 06:25.352
As it happens, Miss Spielrein’s mother
wanted to take her to see Freud.

06:27.437 --> 06:29.064
Another coincidence.

06:31.733 --> 06:34.194
My father thinks my
mother doesn’t love him.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.655
And he’s right, she doesn’t.

06:37.614 --> 06:38.490
How do you know?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.160
My angel told me.

06:43.745 --> 06:44.579
What angel?

06:46.331 --> 06:47.958
An inner voice.

06:47.999 --> 06:51.461
He used to tell me I was
an exceptional person.

06:51.503 --> 06:53.922
For some reason he always spoke in German.

06:53.964 --> 06:57.676
Angels always speak German
... It’s traditional.

06:57.717 --> 07:02.430
He gave me the power to know what people are
going to say before they open their mouths.

07:03.682 --> 07:05.308
Useful ability for a doctor.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.520
You hope to be a doctor
some day, don’t you?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.690
I’ll never be a doctor.

07:11.731 --> 07:12.983
Why not?

07:24.286 --> 07:25.620
I have to go away for awhile.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.497
I’m sorry.

07:27.539 --> 07:28.540
We’ve just gotten started.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.792
Military service.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.251
We all have to do it.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.004
Just for a couple of weeks.

07:34.045 --> 07:34.713
It’s a waste of time!

07:34.754 --> 07:38.258
I can’t tell you whatever
it is you want to know!

07:38.300 --> 07:39.009
You’re just...

07:39.050 --> 07:40.010
you’re just making me angry.

07:40.051 --> 07:41.928
And even if I could tell you,
you’d be sorry you ever...!

07:43.889 --> 07:46.683
Anyway, there’s nothing wrong with me!

07:46.725 --> 07:47.893
I don’t even want to get better!

07:51.021 --> 07:52.063
Stop it!

07:53.398 --> 07:54.065
What?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.276
Will you just stop that!

07:59.529 --> 08:00.363
I’m sorry.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.077
Can we get back now?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.537
Yes, if you want to.

08:07.579 --> 08:08.622
I need to get back.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.876
It’s a complete waste of my time.

08:16.213 --> 08:20.592
Writing prescriptions for athlete’s foot and
examining cocks from morning ‘til night.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.053
Is that what you do?

08:23.094 --> 08:25.222
It’s not good for me.

08:25.263 --> 08:27.224
It’s not good for my patients.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.578
You’re playing with your food.

08:48.579 --> 08:50.455
I'm not hungry.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.916
Is that so?

08:56.962 --> 08:58.797
I shall have to tell Professor Bleuler.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.173
Ha.

09:02.259 --> 09:03.176
Do what you like.

09:23.488 --> 09:25.865
Please, Miss, give me your hand.

09:25.866 --> 09:26.741
Please.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.578
You’ll catch your death.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.162
Miss Spielrein.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.543
The Herr Direktor.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.131
Blueleri feel you may have a little
too much time on your hands.

09:41.173 --> 09:45.010
I’m a great believer in getting our
patients involved in some productive work.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.053
What are your particular interests?

09:49.097 --> 09:50.015
Suicide.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.559
Interplanetary travel.

09:52.601 --> 09:54.769
When Dr.

09:54.811 --> 09:58.398
Jung returns, I shall ask him to discuss
all this with you in more detail.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.776
You keep him away from me.

10:00.818 --> 10:02.820
I never want to see him again!

10:12.538 --> 10:13.956
Now, come along.

10:13.997 --> 10:15.165
Don’t make such a fuss.

10:17.251 --> 10:18.460
Give me those legs.

10:27.177 --> 10:28.345
Here’s the sponge?

10:28.346 --> 10:30.014
Just lie still.

10:30.055 --> 10:32.391
That’s better.

10:37.187 --> 10:37.855
Hello?

10:40.649 --> 10:41.483
I’m back.

10:42.860 --> 10:43.569
How have you been?

10:46.739 --> 10:50.409
I’ve been talking to the Herr Direktor
about finding some work for you.

10:50.451 --> 10:53.662
I told him you’d always been
interested in medicine.

10:53.704 --> 10:58.042
So he suggested you might like to
assist me occasionally in my research.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.966
We’re quite short-staffed so it
would certainly be a help to me.

12:04.024 --> 12:04.692
Vienna.

12:04.693 --> 12:06.318
Woods.

12:07.778 --> 12:08.653
Box.

12:08.654 --> 12:10.113
Bed.

12:10.114 --> 12:12.449
Money.

12:12.491 --> 12:13.742
Bank.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.038
Child.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.748
Soon.

12:22.126 --> 12:22.835
Family.

12:28.257 --> 12:29.341
Unit.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.011
Sex.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.137
Uh...

12:34.972 --> 12:35.931
male.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.516
Wall.

12:38.475 --> 12:39.351
Flower.

12:43.522 --> 12:44.189
Young.

12:49.153 --> 12:49.945
Baby.

12:52.114 --> 12:53.032
Ask.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.450
Answer.

12:54.491 --> 12:55.617
Cap.

12:55.659 --> 12:56.493
Wear.

12:56.535 --> 12:57.453
Stubborn.

12:57.494 --> 12:59.204
Give way.

13:03.792 --> 13:04.960
Ruefulness.

13:11.425 --> 13:12.384
Child.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.681
Fame.

13:17.723 --> 13:18.766
Doctor.

13:23.771 --> 13:24.688
Divorce.

13:29.943 --> 13:30.944
No.

13:33.739 --> 13:35.199
Thank you.

13:39.495 --> 13:40.287
Is that all?

13:40.329 --> 13:41.497
That’s all.

13:43.082 --> 13:44.249
How did I do?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.542
Beautifully.

13:53.509 --> 13:54.134
Good bye.

13:55.177 --> 13:56.762
Yes, good bye.

14:07.439 --> 14:09.233
Any preliminary observations?

14:12.820 --> 14:15.948
Obviously, what’s uppermost
in her mind is her pregnancy.

14:18.117 --> 14:19.118
Good.

14:21.537 --> 14:22.287
And she’s a little...

14:24.248 --> 14:25.165
what’s the word?

14:25.207 --> 14:31.255
Why don’t we try a useful word invented
“ambivalent.

14:31.296 --> 14:36.218
Yes, about the baby.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.261
Anything else?

14:38.262 --> 14:42.599
I’d say she was worried her husband
might be losing interest in her.

14:46.437 --> 14:47.604
What makes you think that?

14:47.605 --> 14:52.401
Long reaction times to the
words “family” and “divorce”.

14:52.443 --> 14:54.361
I see.

14:54.403 --> 14:57.406
And when you said “cap, ” she said “wear”.

14:57.448 --> 15:00.075
Might that be a reference to contraception?

15:02.703 --> 15:04.079
You have quite a flair for this.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.374
Can I ask you something?

15:07.416 --> 15:09.209
Of course.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.629
Is she your wife?

15:25.601 --> 15:26.393
I’m sorry.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.730
Sorry?

15:29.772 --> 15:33.817
I promised you a son on Christmas Day.

15:33.859 --> 15:36.278
And here she is a day
late and the wrong sex.

15:43.786 --> 15:44.953
Don’t be absurd.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.261
‘A’ for Agathe.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.599
Next time I’ll give you a boy.

16:08.185 --> 16:10.688
Can you explain why your
nights have been so bad?

16:17.236 --> 16:18.278
I’m afraid.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.321
Of what?

16:23.075 --> 16:24.702
There’s something in the room.

16:24.743 --> 16:25.452
Something like...

16:27.746 --> 16:30.039
like a cat, only it can speak.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.166
It gets into bed with me.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.171
Last...

16:38.590 --> 16:43.345
last night, it suddenly
whispered something in my ear.

16:43.387 --> 16:44.304
I couldn’t hear what.

16:46.932 --> 16:47.766
But then...

17:01.572 --> 17:04.116
I felt it against my back.

17:05.826 --> 17:09.704
Something slimy like...

17:12.833 --> 17:20.465
like some kind of a mollusc,
moving against my back.

17:24.428 --> 17:25.220
But when I...

17:25.262 --> 17:28.599
when I turned around,
there was nothing there.

17:32.102 --> 17:33.687
You felt it against your back?

17:35.397 --> 17:36.231
Yes.

17:37.483 --> 17:38.400
Were you naked?

17:41.653 --> 17:42.404
I was.

17:43.697 --> 17:44.823
Were you masturbating?

17:49.119 --> 17:50.120
Yes.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.252
Tell me about the first time you can
remember being beaten by your father.

17:59.880 --> 18:04.635
I suppose I was about four.

18:08.681 --> 18:11.016
I’d broken a plate or...

18:12.851 --> 18:14.478
oh, yes, and...

18:15.729 --> 18:24.905
and he told me to go into the little
room and take my clothes off.

18:24.947 --> 18:25.489
And then...

18:29.535 --> 18:37.334
he came in... and spanked me.

18:37.376 --> 18:37.960
And then...

18:40.504 --> 18:45.843
I was so frightened that I
wet myself and then he...

18:47.970 --> 18:49.304
he hit me again.

18:51.765 --> 18:52.891
And then I...

18:55.853 --> 18:59.481
That first time, how did you
feel about what was happening?

19:05.571 --> 19:07.531
<whispering> I liked it.

19:08.991 --> 19:10.367
Would you repeat that, please?

19:10.409 --> 19:11.744
I couldn’t quite hear.

19:14.663 --> 19:16.165
I liked it.

19:20.544 --> 19:21.962
It excited me.

19:25.716 --> 19:27.134
And did you continue to like it?

19:30.763 --> 19:31.847
<crying> Yes!

19:34.600 --> 19:35.351
Yes!

19:38.395 --> 19:44.568
Before long, he only just had to say to me
to go to the little room and I would...

19:47.321 --> 19:48.906
I would start to get wet.

19:54.828 --> 20:02.127
When it came to my brothers or
even just threatened that...

20:04.004 --> 20:05.130
that was enough.

20:05.172 --> 20:06.215
I’d have to go down and...

20:06.256 --> 20:10.094
I wanted to lie down and touch myself.

20:12.137 --> 20:14.223
Later, at school, anything would...

20:14.264 --> 20:20.062
set it off, any kind of humiliation.

20:20.104 --> 20:23.107
I looked for any humiliation.

20:23.148 --> 20:29.446
Even here when you hit
my coat with your stick.

20:29.488 --> 20:34.243
I had to come back right
away, I was so excited.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.794
There’s...

20:46.964 --> 20:48.424
there’s no hope for me.

20:50.134 --> 20:53.134
I’m vile and filthy and corrupt.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.394
I must...

21:02.480 --> 21:04.440
I must never be let out of here.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.571
So good to meet you at long last.

21:51.612 --> 21:52.446
Professor Freud.

21:54.615 --> 21:55.700
You’re most welcome.

21:57.326 --> 21:58.035
Please.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.919
Perhaps the terms themselves
should be reviewed.

22:06.961 --> 22:10.808
If, for instance, we could come
up with some milder term than

22:10.809 --> 22:14.468
“libido” we might not encounter
such emotional resistance.

22:14.510 --> 22:17.471
It would make the teaching
side of things much easier.

22:17.513 --> 22:19.640
Is euphemism a good idea?

22:20.349 --> 22:23.895
Once they work out what we actually mean,
they’ll be just as appalled as ever.

22:25.062 --> 22:28.024
I take your point, but I still
think it’s worth trying to

22:28.025 --> 22:30.985
sweeten the pill when it comes
to questions of sexuality.

22:31.569 --> 22:35.114
And, by the way, please don’t feel
you have to restrain yourself here.

22:35.156 --> 22:39.911
My family are all veterans of the most
unsuitable topics of mealtime conversation.

22:53.090 --> 22:56.038
I have a number of clinical
examples which I believe

22:56.039 --> 22:58.596
support my position with
regard to sexuality.

22:58.638 --> 22:59.889
Hm.

23:04.227 --> 23:06.479
And how is your little Russian patient?

23:07.939 --> 23:13.361
As I told you, after the initial abreaction
there was the most dramatic improvement.

23:13.402 --> 23:15.900
We’ve enrolled her in the
medical school at the

23:15.901 --> 23:18.241
University where she’s
doing extremely well.

23:18.991 --> 23:22.203
She’s a walking advertisement for the
effectiveness of psychoanalysis.

23:22.912 --> 23:24.747
Psychoanalysis.

23:26.749 --> 23:27.375
Oh?

23:28.960 --> 23:30.127
It’s more logical.

23:32.797 --> 23:34.090
And it sounds better.

23:34.131 --> 23:36.467
If you say so.

23:42.139 --> 23:43.516
Are you still treating her?

23:45.309 --> 23:49.021
Yes, and we continue to
unearth new material.

23:50.064 --> 23:56.167
For example, the extraordinary procedure she
devised as a small child, where she would sit on

23:56.168 --> 24:02.075
one heel, attempt to defecate and at the same
time try to prevent herself from defecating.

24:02.076 --> 24:03.202
Hm.

24:05.538 --> 24:08.165
She said this gave rise to
the most blissful feelings.

24:08.207 --> 24:10.376
Nice story.

24:11.502 --> 24:14.572
Those of my patients who remain
fixated at the anal stage of their

24:14.573 --> 24:17.550
erotic development often come out
with the most amusing details.

24:18.426 --> 24:21.606
And, of course, all of them
are finicky, compulsively

24:21.607 --> 24:24.432
tidy, stubborn and extremely
stingy with money.

24:24.473 --> 24:26.976
No doubt your Russian
conforms to this pattern.

24:28.603 --> 24:29.729
Well, no, she doesn’t.

24:32.106 --> 24:35.369
The masochistic aspects of
her condition are much more

24:35.370 --> 24:38.988
deeply rooted than any anal
fixations we may have uncovered.

24:39.030 --> 24:40.948
The two are intimately connected.

24:40.990 --> 24:45.454
I can only tell you that
she’s rather disorganized,

24:45.455 --> 24:49.832
emotionally generous and
exceptionally idealistic.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.877
Well, perhaps it’s a Russian thing.

24:54.670 --> 24:57.006
Is she a virgin?

24:57.048 --> 25:00.091
Yes.

25:00.092 --> 25:00.927
Certainly.

25:00.968 --> 25:02.428
Mmm.

25:02.470 --> 25:04.138
Almost certainly.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.850
No, certainly.

25:11.395 --> 25:12.271
Hm.

25:26.619 --> 25:28.655
I don’t think you have
any notion of the true

25:28.656 --> 25:30.957
strengths and depths of the
opposition to our work.

25:31.874 --> 25:36.754
There’s a whole medical establishment, of
course, baying to send Freud to the auto-da-fe.

25:36.796 --> 25:40.047
But that’s as nothing compared to
what happens when our ideas begin to

25:40.048 --> 25:43.344
trickle through in whatever garbled
form they’re relayed to the public.

25:43.386 --> 25:47.765
The denials, the frenzy,
the incoherent rage.

25:48.933 --> 25:52.165
But might that not be caused
by your insistence on the

25:52.166 --> 25:55.690
exclusively sexual interpretation
of the clinical material?

25:57.567 --> 26:01.821
All I’m doing is pointing out what experience
indicates to me must be the truth.

26:01.863 --> 26:06.033
And I can assure you that in a hundred year's
time, our work will still be rejected.

26:08.369 --> 26:11.038
Columbus, you know, had no idea
what country he’d discovered.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.708
Like him, I’m in the dark.

26:13.749 --> 26:18.504
All I know is I’ve set foot on the
shore and the country exists.

26:20.173 --> 26:21.966
I think of you more as Galileo.

26:23.134 --> 26:25.583
And your opponents as those
who condemned him, while

26:25.584 --> 26:27.847
refusing even to put their
eye to his telescope.

26:29.682 --> 26:32.560
In any event, I have simply opened a door.

26:32.602 --> 26:36.022
It’s for the young men like
yourself to walk through it.

26:36.647 --> 26:38.983
I’m sure you have many
more doors to open for us.

26:40.568 --> 26:46.489
Of course, there’s the added difficulty,
more ammunition for our enemies,

26:46.490 --> 26:52.330
that all of us here in Vienna, in our
psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.

26:54.457 --> 26:56.209
I don’t see what difference that makes.

27:01.047 --> 27:05.009
That, if I may say so, is an
exquisitely Protestant remark.

27:12.266 --> 27:13.184
I dreamed...

27:15.228 --> 27:20.816
I dreamed about a horse being hoisted
by cables to a considerable height.

27:21.817 --> 27:25.196
Suddenly, a cable breaks and the
horse is dashed to the ground.

27:25.238 --> 27:26.906
But it’s not hurt.

27:27.949 --> 27:31.176
It leaps up and gallops away,
impeded only by a heavy

27:31.177 --> 27:34.163
log, which it’s obliged
to drag along the ground.

27:34.622 --> 27:39.794
Then a rider on a small horse appears in front
of it so that it’s forced to slow down.

27:39.836 --> 27:43.257
And a carriage appears in
front of the small horse so

27:43.258 --> 27:46.551
that our horse is compelled
to slow down even more.

27:51.848 --> 27:53.599
I imagine the horse is yourself.

27:53.641 --> 27:55.560
Yes.

27:55.601 --> 27:58.771
Your ambition has been
frustrated in some way.

28:00.565 --> 28:02.567
The rider slowing me down.

28:02.608 --> 28:03.568
Yes.

28:03.609 --> 28:07.864
I think this may refer to
my wife’s first pregnancy.

28:08.823 --> 28:11.701
I had to give up an opportunity
to go to America because of it.

28:11.742 --> 28:12.869
Ah.

28:14.161 --> 28:19.657
The carriage in front perhaps alludes to
an apprehension that our two daughters,

28:19.658 --> 28:24.881
and other children perhaps still to come,
will impede my progress even more.

28:24.922 --> 28:28.092
As a father of six, I can vouch for that.

28:28.134 --> 28:31.971
Not to mention the inevitable
financial difficulties.

28:32.013 --> 28:32.638
No.

28:32.639 --> 28:35.057
Fortunately, my wife is extremely wealthy.

28:36.893 --> 28:37.727
Ah.

28:39.312 --> 28:40.104
Yes.

28:40.146 --> 28:42.523
That is fortunate.

28:52.575 --> 28:53.743
This log...

28:55.119 --> 28:55.828
Yes?

28:55.870 --> 28:59.874
I think, perhaps, you should entertain the
possibility that it represents the penis.

29:03.252 --> 29:04.128
Yes.

29:06.172 --> 29:10.614
In which case what may be at issue
is that a certain sexual constraint

29:10.615 --> 29:15.181
has been brought about by a fear of a
succession of endless pregnancies.

29:17.141 --> 29:20.574
I’m bound to say that if one
of my patients had brought me

29:20.575 --> 29:24.065
this dream I might have said
that the number of restraining

29:24.066 --> 29:27.789
elements surrounding this unfortunate
horse could perhaps point

29:27.790 --> 29:31.280
to the determined suppression
of some unruly sexual desire.

29:33.991 --> 29:34.825
Yes.

29:34.867 --> 29:37.578
There is that as well.

29:46.963 --> 29:54.095
I wonder if you’re aware of the fact that our
conversation has so far lasted 13 hours?

29:56.138 --> 29:57.430
I’m so sorry.

29:57.431 --> 29:58.307
I had no idea.

29:57.849 --> 30:00.143
My dear young colleague,
please don’t apologize.

30:01.436 --> 30:05.398
It was our first meeting, we had a
great deal to say to one another.

30:08.151 --> 30:12.697
And unless I’m much
mistaken, we always will.

30:15.617 --> 30:17.118
I shall have to be extremely careful.

30:17.952 --> 30:19.079
What do you mean?

30:19.120 --> 30:19.788
Why?

30:20.747 --> 30:22.916
He’s so persuasive, he’s so convincing.

30:22.957 --> 30:26.878
He makes you feel you should abandon your
own ideas and simply follow in his wake.

30:27.921 --> 30:31.508
His followers in Vienna are
all deeply unimpressive.

30:31.549 --> 30:36.721
A crowd of Bohemians and degenerates just
picking up the crumbs from his table.

30:36.763 --> 30:39.135
Well, perhaps he’s reached
the stage where obedience

30:39.136 --> 30:41.059
is more important to
him than originality.

30:41.101 --> 30:42.018
Hm.

30:42.060 --> 30:45.853
I tried to tackle him about his
obsession with sexuality, his

30:45.854 --> 30:49.401
insistence on interpreting
every symptom in sexual terms.

30:49.442 --> 30:51.820
But he’s completely inflexible.

30:53.488 --> 30:55.699
In my case, of course he’d have been right.

30:56.991 --> 31:01.036
Yes, as you would expect
him to be in many cases.

31:01.037 --> 31:03.081
Possibly even the majority of cases.

31:04.999 --> 31:08.211
But there must be more than
one hinge into the universe.

31:31.901 --> 31:32.861
Do you like Wagner?

31:33.820 --> 31:35.405
The music and the man, yes.

31:35.447 --> 31:37.532
I’m very interested in
the myth of Siegfried.

31:37.574 --> 31:40.868
The idea that something
pure and heroic can come...

31:40.869 --> 31:45.040
can perhaps only come...
from a sin, even a sin as dark as incest.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.209
This is very strange.

31:49.127 --> 31:49.919
What?

31:49.961 --> 31:52.672
As I’ve told you, I don’t
believe in coincidence.

31:52.714 --> 31:54.591
I believe nothing happens by accident.

31:54.632 --> 31:56.343
All these things have significance.

31:56.384 --> 32:00.180
The fact is I’m in the middle of writing
something myself about the Siegfried myth.

32:00.221 --> 32:00.928
Are you really?

32:00.929 --> 32:01.598
I assure you.

32:03.058 --> 32:04.726
Which is your favourite of the operas?

32:04.727 --> 32:06.227
Das Rheingold.

32:07.228 --> 32:08.355
Yes, that’s right.

32:08.396 --> 32:09.647
Mine too.

32:12.359 --> 32:13.485
Can I ask you something?

32:13.526 --> 32:14.861
Of course.

32:18.365 --> 32:21.618
Do you think there’s any possibility
I could ever be a psychiatrist?

32:23.244 --> 32:24.454
I know you could.

32:25.580 --> 32:28.291
I hear nothing but good reports
on your work at the university.

32:29.709 --> 32:31.586
You’re exactly the kind of person we need.

32:33.296 --> 32:34.464
Insane, you mean?

32:37.092 --> 32:38.009
<laughing> Yes.

32:38.051 --> 32:41.137
We sane doctors have serious limitations.

32:42.847 --> 32:47.345
“Dear Friend, I feel I can, at
last, permit myself this informal

32:47.346 --> 32:51.981
mode of address as I ask you to
grant me a very particular favour.

32:52.023 --> 32:55.605
Dr. Otto Gross, a most
brilliant but erratic

32:55.606 --> 32:59.823
character, is urgently in
need of your medical help.

33:00.699 --> 33:03.857
I consider him, apart from
yourself, the only man

33:03.858 --> 33:07.205
capable of making a major
contribution to our field.

33:07.831 --> 33:10.725
Whatever you do, don’t let
him out before October

33:10.726 --> 33:13.503
when I shall be able to
take him over from you.

33:14.295 --> 33:18.508
And remember his father’s
warning, made when Otto was

33:18.509 --> 33:22.721
watch out for him, he bites.

33:23.513 --> 33:25.557
You still feel threatened by your father?

33:28.601 --> 33:32.188
Anyone with any sense feels
threatened by my father.

33:33.398 --> 33:35.150
He is extremely threatening.

33:38.820 --> 33:42.830
His wish to have you
hospitalized, you don’t think

33:42.831 --> 33:46.369
that arises from a concern
for your welfare?

33:49.539 --> 34:02.510
Listen, what does any normal old patriarch
want in the twilight of his life?

34:04.971 --> 34:09.016
Grandchildren, grandsons, am I right?

34:10.643 --> 34:14.338
And yet, last summer, when I presented him
with not one, but two little Grosses,

34:14.339 --> 34:17.942
one by my wife, one by one of my most
respectable mistresses, was he grateful?

34:39.422 --> 34:43.658
And now that there’s another
one on the way, admittedly

34:43.659 --> 34:47.138
by some woman I hardly
know, he’s apoplectic.

34:48.806 --> 34:51.726
And all he can think is to get me
banged away in some institution.

34:55.855 --> 34:57.315
You got any children?

34:57.357 --> 34:59.234
Two girls.

34:59.275 --> 35:00.110
Same mother?

35:00.151 --> 35:01.194
Yes.

35:05.616 --> 35:08.243
So you’re not a believer in monogamy?

35:09.620 --> 35:14.124
For a neurotic like myself, I can’t
possibly imagine a more stressful concept.

35:17.419 --> 35:22.410
And you don’t find it necessary or
desirable to exercise some restraint

35:22.411 --> 35:27.054
as a contribution, say, to the
smooth functioning of civilization.

35:27.095 --> 35:29.598
What, and make myself ill?

35:31.016 --> 35:34.095
I should have thought that
some form of sexual repression

35:34.096 --> 35:36.855
would have to be practiced
in any rational society.

35:39.399 --> 35:42.069
No wonder the hospitals
are bulging at the seams.

35:46.532 --> 35:50.671
Tell me, do you find the best way
to enhance your popularity with

35:50.672 --> 35:54.998
your patients is to tell them whatever
it is they most want to hear?

35:55.999 --> 35:58.585
What does it matter whether
we’re popular with them or not?

35:58.627 --> 35:59.711
Well, I don’t know.

36:00.879 --> 36:02.464
Suppose you want to fuck them?

36:08.303 --> 36:16.728
If there is one thing I’ve learned in my short
never repress anything.

37:03.275 --> 37:06.069
So you’ve never slept with
any of your patients?

37:07.404 --> 37:08.197
Of course not.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.940
I have to steer through the
temptations of transference and

37:12.941 --> 37:16.747
counter-transference and that’s an
essential stage of the process.

37:17.706 --> 37:23.873
When transference occurs, when the
patient becomes fixated on me, I explain

37:23.874 --> 37:29.634
to her that this is merely a symbol
of her wretched monogamous habits.

37:29.635 --> 37:34.984
I assure her that it’s fine to want to sleep
with me, but only if, at the same time,

37:34.985 --> 37:40.270
she acknowledges to herself that she wants
to sleep with a great many other people.

37:41.313 --> 37:42.439
Suppose she doesn’t?

37:43.524 --> 37:46.360
Then it’s my job to convince her
that’s part of the illness.

37:51.114 --> 37:52.491
That’s what people are like.

37:52.492 --> 37:55.661
If we don’t tell them the truth, who will?

37:57.371 --> 37:59.081
You think Freud’s right?

37:59.122 --> 38:02.960
You think all neurosis is of
exclusively sexual origin?

38:06.213 --> 38:09.394
I think Freud’s obsession
with sex probably has a great

38:09.395 --> 38:12.177
deal to do with the fact
that he never gets any.

38:14.096 --> 38:14.972
You could be right.

38:16.557 --> 38:23.198
It seems to me a measure of the true perversity
of the human race, that one of its very few

38:23.199 --> 38:29.695
reliably pleasurable activities should be the
subject of so much hysteria and repression.

38:32.614 --> 38:38.579
But not to repress yourself is to unleash all
kinds of dangerous and destructive forces.

38:40.372 --> 38:44.126
Our job is to make our
patients capable of freedom.

38:47.671 --> 38:50.674
I’ve heard it said that you helped one
of your patients to kill herself.

38:51.675 --> 38:53.677
She was resolutely suicidal.

38:53.719 --> 38:57.681
I just explained how she could
do it without botching it.

38:59.766 --> 39:03.270
Then I asked her if she didn’t prefer
the idea of becoming my lover.

39:08.066 --> 39:09.401
She opted for both.

39:10.694 --> 39:12.946
That can’t be what we
want for our patients.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.828
Freedom is freedom.

39:23.081 --> 39:25.042
I’ve been thinking about Wagner’s opera.

39:25.083 --> 39:28.777
In it, he says that perfection
can only be arrived at through

39:28.778 --> 39:32.174
what is conventionally thought
of as sin, is that right?

39:32.216 --> 39:38.430
Which must surely have to do with the energy
created by the friction of opposites.

39:38.472 --> 39:43.936
Not just that you’re the doctor and I’m the
patient, but that you’re Swiss and I’m Russian.

39:43.977 --> 39:48.190
I’m Jewish and you’re Aryan and all
other kinds of darker differences.

39:49.358 --> 39:50.234
Darker?

39:50.275 --> 39:57.658
If I’m right, only the clash of destructive
forces can create something new.

39:59.285 --> 40:04.373
When my father brought me to you, I was
very ill and my illness was sexual.

40:04.415 --> 40:09.003
It’s clear that the subject I’m studying
is entirely grounded in sexuality.

40:09.045 --> 40:11.784
So, naturally, I’m becoming
more and more acutely

40:11.785 --> 40:14.633
aware of the fact that I
have no sexual experience.

40:16.510 --> 40:19.096
Law students are not normally
expected to rob banks.

40:34.904 --> 40:37.531
It’s generally thought to be the man
who should take the initiative.

40:39.325 --> 40:41.744
Don’t you think there’s
something male in every woman?

40:41.786 --> 40:44.038
And something female in every man?

40:44.080 --> 40:45.498
Or should be?

40:46.332 --> 40:47.208
Maybe.

40:49.835 --> 40:51.253
I expect you’re right, yes.

40:53.631 --> 40:57.532
If you ever want to take
the initiative, I live

40:57.533 --> 41:01.514
in that building there,
where the bay window is.

41:18.072 --> 41:19.740
I can’t understand what you’re waiting for.

41:21.909 --> 41:26.287
Just take her to some secluded spot and
thrash her to within an inch of her life.

41:26.288 --> 41:28.207
That’s clearly what she wants.

41:29.917 --> 41:31.919
How can you deny her
such a simple pleasure?

41:32.670 --> 41:34.964
Pleasure is never simple,
as you very well know.

41:37.508 --> 41:38.175
It is.

41:39.135 --> 41:40.219
Of course it is.

41:41.470 --> 41:43.097
Until we decide to complicate it.

41:44.932 --> 41:46.600
What my father calls maturity.

41:48.185 --> 41:49.395
What I call surrender.

41:51.814 --> 41:54.025
Surrender, for me, would be
to give in to these urges.

41:54.026 --> 41:55.526
Then surrender.

41:57.486 --> 42:01.157
It doesn’t matter what you call it as long
as you don’t let the experience escape.

42:04.118 --> 42:05.786
That’s my prescription.

42:07.705 --> 42:09.248
I’m supposed to be treating you.

42:10.416 --> 42:12.209
And it’s been most effective.

42:12.793 --> 42:19.508
<laughing> I’d say the analysis
was not too far from completion.

42:21.677 --> 42:23.220
Mine, yes.

42:24.972 --> 42:26.557
Not so sure about yours.

42:28.809 --> 42:31.742
I’ve been spending so much
time with him, I’m afraid

42:31.743 --> 42:34.398
I’ve been neglecting some
of my other patients.

42:36.942 --> 42:42.573
He’s immensely seductive, quite sure
he’s right and obsessionally neurotic.

42:44.492 --> 42:46.035
Pretty dangerous, in fact.

42:49.372 --> 42:51.665
Do you mean you doubt your
powers to convince him?

42:52.958 --> 42:53.959
Worse than that.

42:55.586 --> 42:57.880
What I’m afraid of is his
power to convince me.

42:59.423 --> 43:03.352
On the subject of monogamy, for
example, why should we put so much

43:03.353 --> 43:07.223
frantic effort into suppressing
our most basic natural instincts?

43:09.433 --> 43:10.726
I don’t know.

43:10.768 --> 43:11.811
You tell me.

43:24.407 --> 43:25.199
Thank you.

43:27.076 --> 43:28.327
I really needed that.

44:08.159 --> 44:13.247
“Dr. Jung, rest assured that thanks
to you, I am alive and healthy.

44:14.248 --> 44:18.085
But please be so good as to
tell my father that I am dead.

44:19.754 --> 44:24.592
And whatever you do, do not pass by
the oasis without stopping to drink.

44:25.718 --> 44:26.510
Otto.

44:49.700 --> 44:50.659
Who is it?

44:52.661 --> 44:53.496
A friend.

45:01.754 --> 45:02.588
Come inside.

45:56.976 --> 45:57.893
It’s so beautiful.

45:59.270 --> 46:01.272
I feel as though we’ve always lived here.

46:01.313 --> 46:04.316
They say we’ll be able to move
in by the end of the week.

46:07.236 --> 46:08.988
I’m sorry to be like this again.

46:09.864 --> 46:10.740
What do you mean?

46:12.324 --> 46:14.076
So big and unattractive.

46:14.118 --> 46:15.619
Don’t be absurd.

46:17.580 --> 46:20.624
I expect you wish you were a
polygamist, like Otto Gross.

46:24.920 --> 46:30.885
If I were, it would be something quite
different than what we have, which is sacred.

46:32.887 --> 46:34.513
I would have to be sure
you understood that.

46:36.974 --> 46:38.893
I wouldn’t want to know anything about it.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.230
I have a surprise for you.

46:52.615 --> 46:56.077
The boat you always wanted with red sails.

46:59.413 --> 47:00.289
Thank you.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.710
Thank you for all of this.

47:05.795 --> 47:07.046
You’re a good man.

47:08.756 --> 47:10.925
You deserve everything that’s good.

47:25.731 --> 47:29.777
If I say something, will you promise
not to take it the wrong way?

47:32.154 --> 47:33.072
What?

47:37.326 --> 47:38.953
Don’t you think we ought to stop...

47:38.994 --> 47:41.080
now?

47:44.375 --> 47:45.418
I’m married.

47:46.752 --> 47:48.462
Obviously, I’m being deceitful.

47:50.631 --> 47:53.092
Is it right for us to
perpetuate this deceit?

47:53.759 --> 47:54.927
Do you want to stop?

47:56.137 --> 47:57.304
Of course I don’t.

48:03.102 --> 48:08.691
When you make love to your wife, how is it?

48:10.359 --> 48:11.610
Describe it to me.

48:16.282 --> 48:20.411
When you live under the same roof
with someone, it becomes habit.

48:22.621 --> 48:25.124
You know, it’s always very tender.

48:27.335 --> 48:29.003
Then this is another thing.

48:30.546 --> 48:34.133
Another thing in another country.

48:40.306 --> 48:44.435
With me, I want you to be ferocious.

48:47.188 --> 48:48.814
I want you to punish me.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.876
I knew it was a boy this time.

49:08.918 --> 49:10.753
I told you.

49:11.462 --> 49:12.630
I believed you.

49:17.718 --> 49:19.345
Will you come back to us now?

50:23.493 --> 50:24.202
Pity.

50:24.244 --> 50:27.455
I should never have sent
Doctor Gross to you.

50:27.497 --> 50:29.415
I blame myself.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.751
No, I’m very grateful you did.

50:31.793 --> 50:35.630
All those provocative discussions helped
crystallize a lot of my thinking.

50:35.672 --> 50:37.257
Hm.

50:38.132 --> 50:40.927
Did he really send you his hotel bill?

50:42.136 --> 50:43.596
Only for a couple of nights.

50:47.308 --> 50:48.434
He’s an addict.

50:49.185 --> 50:50.353
I can see that now.

50:51.104 --> 50:54.232
He can only end by doing
great harm to our movement.

50:57.986 --> 51:02.115
You realize this makes you
undisputed Crown Prince, don’t you?

51:03.116 --> 51:04.325
My son and heir?

51:05.743 --> 51:08.371
I’m not sure I deserve such an accolade.

51:08.913 --> 51:10.498
Don’t say another word.

51:14.043 --> 51:16.129
I often take my walk up here.

51:17.839 --> 51:20.675
It’s inspired some of my best ideas.

51:21.759 --> 51:24.304
You mustn’t think I have a closed mind.

51:24.345 --> 51:27.834
I have absolutely no
objection to your studying

51:27.835 --> 51:31.686
telepathy or parapsychology
to your heart’s content.

51:33.855 --> 51:37.516
But I would make the point that our
own field is so embattled that

51:37.517 --> 51:40.904
it can only be dangerous to stray
into any kind of mysticism.

51:41.946 --> 51:42.906
Don’t you see?

51:42.947 --> 51:46.326
We have to stay within the most
rigorously scientific confines.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.539
Are you all right?

51:51.581 --> 51:54.583
Yes, but I can’t agree with you.

51:54.584 --> 52:00.632
Why should we draw some arbitrary line and
rule out whole areas of investigation?

52:00.673 --> 52:03.224
Precisely because the
world is full of enemies

52:03.225 --> 52:05.720
looking for any way they
can to discredit us.

52:05.762 --> 52:10.027
And the moment they see us abandon
the firm ground of sexual theory

52:10.028 --> 52:13.853
to wallow in the black mud of
superstition they will pounce.

52:19.484 --> 52:23.738
As far as I’m concerned, even to raise
these subjects is professional suicide.

52:27.408 --> 52:28.993
I knew that was going to happen!

52:29.035 --> 52:30.119
What?

52:30.161 --> 52:32.622
I felt something like
that was going to happen.

52:32.664 --> 52:34.499
I had a kind of burning in my stomach.

52:34.541 --> 52:36.000
What are you talking about?

52:37.085 --> 52:38.086
It’s the heating.

52:38.127 --> 52:40.755
The wood in the bookcase
just cracked, that’s all.

52:40.797 --> 52:41.297
No.

52:41.339 --> 52:44.300
It’s what’s known as a catalytic
exteriorization phenomenon.

52:44.843 --> 52:45.593
A what?

52:45.635 --> 52:48.680
A catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.

52:48.721 --> 52:50.139
Don’t be ridiculous.

52:50.181 --> 52:52.058
My diaphragm started to glow red hot.

52:54.519 --> 52:57.063
And another thing... it’s
going to happen again.

52:57.105 --> 52:57.814
What?

52:57.856 --> 52:59.816
In a minute, it’s going to happen again.

53:00.567 --> 53:03.862
My dear young friend, this is exactly
the kind of thing I’m talking about.

53:05.655 --> 53:06.489
You see?

53:07.699 --> 53:08.616
That’s just...

53:08.658 --> 53:10.577
you really can’t be serious.

53:10.618 --> 53:14.622
There are so many mysteries,
so much further to go.

53:14.664 --> 53:15.248
Please.

53:15.290 --> 53:16.332
We can’t be too careful.

53:16.374 --> 53:19.669
We can’t afford to wander
into these speculative areas.

53:19.711 --> 53:24.257
Telepathy, singing bookcases, fairies
at the bottom of the garden.

53:24.299 --> 53:26.009
It won’t do.

53:30.847 --> 53:31.764
It won’t do.

53:55.788 --> 54:01.471
There’s a poem by Lermontov keeps going
round my head about a prisoner who finally

54:01.472 --> 54:06.674
achieves some happiness when he succeeds
in releasing a bird from its cage.

54:07.675 --> 54:09.761
Why do you think this is preoccupying you?

54:11.721 --> 54:16.414
I think it means that when I
become a doctor what I want

54:16.415 --> 54:21.272
more than anything is to give
people back their freedom...

54:23.233 --> 54:24.817
the way you gave me mine.

54:24.859 --> 54:27.611
Right.

54:27.612 --> 54:28.988
That’s enough now.

54:32.867 --> 54:34.369
There we go.

54:37.247 --> 54:38.289
Fascinating.

54:38.331 --> 54:40.250
Come along, my dear.

54:43.336 --> 54:46.130
All the standard symptoms
of the nymphomaniac.

54:50.552 --> 54:51.386
Yes.

54:52.470 --> 54:57.392
Except that whenever anyone responded
to her advances, she would run a mile.

54:58.685 --> 55:00.520
That’s the puzzling feature of the case.

55:03.231 --> 55:04.315
Hm.

55:06.192 --> 55:10.196
I must say it’s a great pleasure to
see you in your natural habitat.

55:26.546 --> 55:28.677
There’s a rumour running
around Vienna that

55:28.678 --> 55:31.050
you’ve taken one of your
patients as a mistress.

55:34.345 --> 55:35.805
It’s absolutely untrue.

55:36.931 --> 55:38.349
Well, of course it is.

55:39.601 --> 55:41.186
So I’ve been telling everyone.

55:41.227 --> 55:43.271
What’s being said?

55:43.313 --> 55:45.565
Oh, I don’t know.

55:45.607 --> 55:48.443
That the woman’s been bragging about it.

55:48.484 --> 55:51.779
That somebody is sending
out anonymous letters.

55:51.821 --> 55:53.031
The usual sort of thing.

55:55.033 --> 55:57.035
Bound to happen sooner or later.

55:58.494 --> 56:00.288
It’s an occupational hazard.

56:03.917 --> 56:04.709
Yes.

56:06.294 --> 56:09.839
I hope I’d never be stupid enough to get
emotionally involved with a patient.

56:14.135 --> 56:15.053
I’m confused.

56:15.470 --> 56:16.429
I feel trapped.

56:16.471 --> 56:20.517
I’ve trapped myself into
feeling divided, guilty.

56:20.558 --> 56:22.560
I’ve never wanted you to feel guilty.

56:22.602 --> 56:24.229
I don’t see how we can go on.

56:26.731 --> 56:28.066
You mustn’t say that.

56:28.107 --> 56:29.192
I have some kind of illness.

56:29.234 --> 56:33.112
Try to remember the love and patience I
showed towards you when you were ill.

56:33.154 --> 56:34.113
That’s what I need from you now.

56:34.155 --> 56:34.781
Of course.

56:34.822 --> 56:36.282
You have it always.

56:36.324 --> 56:38.575
Oh, please don’t go.

56:38.576 --> 56:39.327
I must.

56:39.369 --> 56:40.495
I have to.

56:40.537 --> 56:41.079
No.

56:41.120 --> 56:41.994
I have to.

56:41.995 --> 56:42.789
No!

56:44.332 --> 56:45.208
I have to!

57:02.225 --> 57:04.269
I can’t say I’m sorry
to say goodbye to him.

57:05.436 --> 57:07.313
Not the easiest house-guest we’ve ever had.

57:08.147 --> 57:09.065
No.

57:10.483 --> 57:13.069
I don’t think he ever recovered
from the first view of the house.

57:14.863 --> 57:19.158
Still, I suppose compared to
that tiny flat in Vienna...

57:24.372 --> 57:26.582
Why did he refuse to
meet the Herr Direktor?

57:26.583 --> 57:30.920
Oh, he’s always been a great one for
bearing incomprehensible grudges.

57:33.256 --> 57:36.009
Did he say anything to you
about anonymous letters?

57:42.807 --> 57:45.810
Surely you didn’t think I’d let you
go without putting up a fight?

57:53.985 --> 57:54.903
Secretary Fraulein Spielrein!

57:58.239 --> 57:59.532
Why are you doing this?

58:02.160 --> 58:03.244
Please sit down.

58:03.286 --> 58:04.621
And how could you treat me this way?

58:06.831 --> 58:07.832
Sit down.

58:17.467 --> 58:19.761
I tried to explain the
situation to your mother.

58:19.802 --> 58:21.721
I don’t know how you dared
say those things to her.

58:21.763 --> 58:25.475
She came in waving an anonymous letter
demanding to know if it was true.

58:27.227 --> 58:30.364
I told her even if it were,
the position would not be

58:30.365 --> 58:33.733
quite as she imagined, since
you’re no longer my patient.

58:33.775 --> 58:35.818
Of course I’m your patient.

58:35.860 --> 58:36.903
Technically not.

58:36.945 --> 58:38.488
Not since I stopped charging you.

58:39.364 --> 58:40.615
That’s what she said.

58:41.908 --> 58:44.995
I told her I didn’t believe
her and she told me

58:44.996 --> 58:48.081
you said your fee was 20
francs a consultation.

58:48.122 --> 58:51.216
I was trying to make the point that
I would take you back as a patient

58:51.217 --> 58:53.962
but that I could only undertake
to see you inside this office.

58:55.922 --> 59:00.718
How can you be so cold and offhand?

59:02.095 --> 59:06.432
I was trying to make her understand the
distinction between a patient and a friend.

59:13.857 --> 59:18.403
Listen... I’ve made a stupid mistake.

59:18.444 --> 59:19.863
Is that what it was?

59:19.904 --> 59:23.408
I broke one of the elementary
rules of my profession.

59:23.449 --> 59:27.161
I’m your doctor and I believe
I did you some good.

59:28.162 --> 59:30.373
I can’t forgive myself for
overstepping the mark.

59:30.415 --> 59:32.846
I should have known that
if I gave you what you

59:32.847 --> 59:35.378
wanted you wouldn’t be
able to help wanting more.

59:35.420 --> 59:36.296
I don’t want more.

59:36.337 --> 59:37.839
And I never wanted more.

59:37.881 --> 59:38.965
I never asked for more.

59:39.757 --> 59:40.925
You didn’t have to ask.

59:41.885 --> 59:44.792
And even if you’re right,
which I dispute, do you

59:44.793 --> 59:47.640
think this is a proper way
to behave towards me?

59:47.682 --> 59:49.475
Refusing to speak to me
except in your office?

59:49.517 --> 59:50.476
I’m your physician.

59:52.520 --> 59:54.230
From now on, that’s all I can be.

59:56.733 --> 59:58.151
Don’t you love me anymore?

01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:02.406
Only as your physician.

01:00:06.702 --> 01:00:08.662
You think I’m going to stand for this?

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:10.205
What choice do you have?

01:00:24.845 --> 01:00:26.471
And there’s your 20 francs.

01:00:37.232 --> 01:00:41.228
“Dear Professor Freud, I would be most
grateful if you would allow me to

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:45.115
come and visit you in Vienna on a
matter of great interest to us both.

01:00:49.995 --> 01:00:54.707
“Dear Friend, I have just received
this extremely strange letter.

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:56.626
Do you know this woman?

01:00:57.294 --> 01:00:58.295
Who is she?

01:01:04.176 --> 01:01:09.228
“As you will not doubt recall, Spielrein was
the case that brought you and me together,

01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:13.935
for which reason I’ve always regarded her
with special gratitude and affection...

01:01:15.479 --> 01:01:18.398
until I understood that she was
systematically planning my seduction.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.235
Now I have no idea what
her intentions may be.

01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:24.654
Revenge, I suspect.

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:29.326
I have never shown such
friendship to a patient.

01:01:29.368 --> 01:01:32.579
Nor have I ever been made to
suffer so much in return.

01:01:34.122 --> 01:01:38.210
I am hoping you will agree to act as a
kind of go-between and avert a disaster.

01:01:40.754 --> 01:01:44.560
Your famous saying is carved in
block letters on my heart...

01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:48.178
whatever you do, give up any
idea of trying to cure them.

01:01:55.143 --> 01:02:01.024
“Experiences like this, however painful,
are necessary and inevitable.

01:02:01.066 --> 01:02:04.027
Without them, how can we know life?

01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:10.158
“Dear Miss Spielrein, Dr.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.902
Jung is a good friend and
colleague of mine whom I believe

01:02:13.903 --> 01:02:17.040
to be incapable of frivolous
or shabby behaviour.

01:02:17.082 --> 01:02:23.964
What I infer from your letter is that you used
to be close friends, but are no longer so.

01:02:25.215 --> 01:02:28.682
If this is the case I would
urge you to consider whether

01:02:28.683 --> 01:02:32.209
the feelings that have survived
this close friendship are

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:35.251
not best suppressed and
forgotten and without the

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:39.021
intervention and involvement of
third persons such as myself.

01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:48.572
Secretary Herr Doctor.

01:02:49.865 --> 01:02:50.866
Fraulein Spielrein.

01:03:01.084 --> 01:03:01.835
What is it?

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:06.715
I heard you were leaving the hospital.

01:03:08.425 --> 01:03:09.468
As you see.

01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:13.472
People are saying it’s because
of the scandal I caused.

01:03:13.513 --> 01:03:15.182
I’d been planning to leave anyway.

01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.730
Well, I’m sorry if... I precipitated it.

01:03:24.274 --> 01:03:26.068
You’ve always been something of a catalyst.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.741
I’ve had a letter from Professor Freud.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:36.661
Oh, yes?

01:03:36.703 --> 01:03:40.040
The thing that shone through
was how much he loves you.

01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:46.088
But... what was also clear is
that you denied everything.

01:03:46.129 --> 01:03:49.758
You let him think I was
a fantasist or a liar.

01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:52.552
I don’t see that it’s any of his business.

01:03:54.638 --> 01:03:56.390
I’ve come here to ask
you to tell the truth.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:03:59.893
What?

01:03:59.935 --> 01:04:03.062
I want you to write to him
and tell him everything.

01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:06.233
And then I want him to write to me again to
confirm that you’ve told him everything.

01:04:09.027 --> 01:04:10.237
Are you blackmailing me?

01:04:13.949 --> 01:04:17.452
I’m asking you to tell the truth.

01:04:17.494 --> 01:04:20.122
Why is this so important to you?

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.917
I want him to take me as his patient.

01:04:32.634 --> 01:04:33.635
Does it have to be him?

01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:37.097
It has to be him.

01:04:43.645 --> 01:04:45.647
You don’t feel the same
way about him, do you?

01:04:45.689 --> 01:04:50.616
I’m disappointed by his rigid pragmatism,
his insistence that nothing can possibly

01:04:50.617 --> 01:04:55.365
exist unless some puny or transitory
intelligence has first become aware of it.

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:58.827
All the same, will you write to him?

01:05:00.787 --> 01:05:02.539
I could have damaged you, you know?

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:05.792
Far worse than I did.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.628
I chose not to.

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.053
All right.

01:05:16.094 --> 01:05:17.137
I’ll do it.

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:21.975
Thank you.

01:05:25.062 --> 01:05:26.355
It means everything to me.

01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:39.451
Are you going somewhere for the summer?

01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:42.329
Berlin with my parents.

01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:47.459
But you are going to come back
to the university to qualify?

01:05:49.127 --> 01:05:50.045
Of course.

01:05:54.174 --> 01:05:58.512
I’m going to America with Freud,
although he doesn’t yet know it.

01:06:00.555 --> 01:06:01.348
That’s nice.

01:06:02.766 --> 01:06:03.517
Good bye.

01:06:11.024 --> 01:06:14.573
“...in view of my friendship
for the patient and her

01:06:14.574 --> 01:06:17.989
complete trust in me, what
I did was indefensible.

01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:23.412
I confess this, very unhappily,
to you, my father-figure...

01:06:23.453 --> 01:06:25.163
Hm.

01:06:32.045 --> 01:06:35.632
“Dear Miss Spielrein, I owe you an apology.

01:06:35.674 --> 01:06:40.018
But the fact that I was wrong and
that the man is to be blamed

01:06:40.019 --> 01:06:44.224
rather than the woman satisfies
my own need to revere women.

01:06:45.017 --> 01:06:48.204
Please… accept my admiration
for the very dignified

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:51.023
way in which you have
resolved this conflict.

01:06:55.193 --> 01:06:57.571
Do we have all the necessary
paperwork, Ferenczi?

01:06:57.612 --> 01:07:00.198
I have everything, Professor.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.908
Hm.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.952
Good.

01:07:03.994 --> 01:07:05.787
I’ve always been in two
minds about America.

01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:08.790
Maybe we made a foolish error.

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:11.084
Do they really want us there?

01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:14.671
They postponed the Congress for two
months so that you could attend.

01:07:14.713 --> 01:07:16.673
Surely that gives you some indication.

01:07:16.715 --> 01:07:17.591
Hm.

01:07:17.632 --> 01:07:18.800
Yes.

01:07:18.842 --> 01:07:20.844
I think it’s going to be a great adventure.

01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:21.720
Yes.

01:07:23.513 --> 01:07:24.598
I hope you’re right.

01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:30.312
I go this way.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.106
What do you mean?

01:07:33.148 --> 01:07:35.776
I left my wife to make the arrangements.

01:07:35.817 --> 01:07:38.904
I’m afraid she’s booked me
a first-class state room.

01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:41.573
I see.

01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:04.429
I was on the Swiss-Austrian border
somewhere in the mountains at dusk.

01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:09.976
There was a long wait because
everybody’s baggage was being searched.

01:08:10.018 --> 01:08:17.192
I noticed a decrepit customs official
wearing the old royal and imperial uniform.

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:21.745
And I was watching him walking up
and down with his melancholy and

01:08:21.746 --> 01:08:26.658
disgruntled expression, when someone
said to me, “He isn’t really there.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.331
He’s a ghost who still hasn’t
found out how to die properly.

01:08:36.627 --> 01:08:37.837
Is that the whole dream?

01:08:37.879 --> 01:08:39.339
All I can remember.

01:08:43.426 --> 01:08:45.554
Did you say the Swiss-Austrian border?

01:08:45.595 --> 01:08:46.513
Yes.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.390
Must have something to do with us.

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:51.518
You think so?

01:08:55.604 --> 01:09:00.609
<clears throat> Everybody’s being searched.

01:09:00.652 --> 01:09:02.028
Hm?

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:06.733
Perhaps that’s an indication that
the ideas which used to flow so

01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:11.580
freely between us are now subject
to a most suspicious examination.

01:09:11.621 --> 01:09:13.457
You mean the ideas flowing
in your direction.

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:17.595
And I’m afraid the old relic
shuffling about in this

01:09:17.596 --> 01:09:20.962
entirely useless fashion
must almost certainly be me.

01:09:20.964 --> 01:09:21.715
Wait a minute.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:24.968
Whom you very mercifully wish
could be put out of his misery.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.263
A humane death wish.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.854
Perhaps the fact that he was unable to die
simply indicated the immortality of his ideas.

01:09:36.897 --> 01:09:37.689
Oh.

01:09:38.982 --> 01:09:39.941
Yes.

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:46.490
So you agree it must have been me?

01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:48.200
I didn’t say that.

01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:49.408
No.

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.953
Never mind.

01:09:51.995 --> 01:09:56.208
It’s a most entertaining example.

01:09:58.919 --> 01:09:59.961
What about you?

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.797
Do you have a dream to report?

01:10:04.049 --> 01:10:06.593
I had a most elaborate dream last night.

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:08.637
Particularly rich.

01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:12.849
Well, let’s hear it.

01:10:15.686 --> 01:10:19.189
I’d love to tell you but
I don’t think I should.

01:10:21.692 --> 01:10:22.818
Why ever not?

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:30.325
I wouldn’t want to risk my authority.

01:10:53.473 --> 01:10:56.852
Take it from me, what you’re
looking at is the future.

01:10:58.895 --> 01:11:02.691
You think they know we’re on our
way, bringing them the plague?

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:30.802
Fraulein Spielrein.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:36.516
Whose idea was it for you to
send me your dissertation?

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:39.561
The Herr Direktor.

01:11:39.603 --> 01:11:41.730
Yes, of course.

01:11:44.983 --> 01:11:49.738
He kept insisting this was the kind of material
you were looking for for your Yearbook.

01:11:51.365 --> 01:11:54.617
It certainly is a very fascinating
case you’ve chosen to investigate.

01:11:54.618 --> 01:11:57.676
But if we’re to consider it
for the Yearbook, there are

01:11:57.677 --> 01:12:00.624
one or two mistakes which
will have to be dealt with.

01:12:00.665 --> 01:12:02.209
Of course.

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.754
Might you have a little
time to discuss all this?

01:12:07.964 --> 01:12:08.882
Yes.

01:12:14.012 --> 01:12:17.485
When I left the hospital and moved
out here I was afraid it would take

01:12:17.486 --> 01:12:20.811
years to build up a roster of
patients but I’m already under siege.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.234
Anyway, I don’t see why a
little more work won’t

01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:28.819
make your dissertation
eminently publishable.

01:12:30.153 --> 01:12:32.447
Do you think we’d be able to
work on it together without...?

01:12:38.995 --> 01:12:42.708
It’s always going to be something
of a risk, us seeing one another.

01:12:44.501 --> 01:12:45.335
Yes.

01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:49.423
But I believe we have the character to be
able to deal with the situation, don’t you?

01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:51.842
I hope so.

01:12:55.303 --> 01:12:58.432
I somehow imagined you’d have
found another admirer by now.

01:13:00.058 --> 01:13:00.809
No.

01:13:03.186 --> 01:13:04.938
You were the jewel of great price.

01:13:12.696 --> 01:13:14.698
Shall we say this time next Tuesday?

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:18.118
And I’ll start gently
ripping you to shreds.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:32.758
Explain this analogy you make between the
sex instinct and the death instinct.

01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:40.640
Professor Freud claims that the sexual drive
arises from a simple urge towards pleasure.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:44.811
If he’s right, the question is why is this
urge so often successfully repressed?

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:48.378
You used to have a theory
involving the impulse towards

01:13:48.379 --> 01:13:51.526
destruction and self-destruction,
losing oneself.

01:13:51.568 --> 01:13:57.089
Well, suppose we think of sexuality as fusion...
losing oneself, as you say, but

01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:02.746
losing oneself in the other...
in other words, destroying one’s own individuality.

01:14:02.788 --> 01:14:06.541
Wouldn’t the ego, in self-defense,
automatically resist that impulse?

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:09.419
You mean for selfish not
for social reasons?

01:14:09.461 --> 01:14:10.128
Yes.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:15.467
I’m saying that perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego.

01:14:18.011 --> 01:14:21.056
In other words, the opposite
of what Freud proposes.

01:15:02.389 --> 01:15:05.100
When I graduate, I’ve
decided to leave Zurich.

01:15:10.397 --> 01:15:11.398
I have to.

01:15:14.985 --> 01:15:15.861
Why?

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:17.863
You know why.

01:15:24.745 --> 01:15:25.704
It’s true.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.794
I’m nothing but a philistine Swiss
bourgeois complacent coward.

01:15:32.836 --> 01:15:38.884
I want to leave everything, break
away and disappear with you.

01:15:43.013 --> 01:15:45.057
Then comes the voice of the philistine.

01:15:49.728 --> 01:15:50.687
Where will you go?

01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:53.231
Vienna, maybe.

01:15:54.274 --> 01:15:55.400
Please don’t go there.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.780
I must go wherever I need to feel free.

01:16:12.084 --> 01:16:12.918
<sobbing> Don’t...

01:16:27.724 --> 01:16:28.767
You know your paper...

01:16:29.601 --> 01:16:32.067
led to one of the most
stimulating discussions

01:16:32.068 --> 01:16:34.481
we’ve ever had at the
Psychoanalytic Society.

01:16:36.066 --> 01:16:40.320
Do you really think the sexual drive
is a demonic and destructive force?

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:45.002
Yes, at the same time as being a
creative force, in the sense that it can

01:16:45.003 --> 01:16:49.329
produce, out of the destruction of
two individualities, a new being.

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:52.525
But the individual must always
overcome resistance because

01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:55.252
of the self-annihilating
nature of the sexual act.

01:16:57.838 --> 01:16:58.797
Hm.

01:16:58.839 --> 01:17:04.050
I’ve fought against the idea for
some time, but I suppose there

01:17:04.051 --> 01:17:09.099
must be some kind of indissoluble
link between sex and death.

01:17:10.851 --> 01:17:14.993
I don’t feel the relationship between the
two is quite the way you have portrayed it,

01:17:14.994 --> 01:17:18.942
but I’m most grateful to you for animating
the subject in such a stimulating way.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:23.352
The only slight shock was
your introduction, at the

01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:26.283
very end of your paper,
of the name of Christ.

01:17:28.493 --> 01:17:33.498
Are you completely opposed to any kind
of religious dimension in our field?

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.904
In general, I don’t care if a
man believes in Rama, Marx or

01:17:36.905 --> 01:17:40.380
Aphrodite, as long as he keeps
it out of the consulting room.

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.759
Is that what’s at the bottom
of your dispute with Dr.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.343
Jung?

01:17:44.344 --> 01:17:47.554
I have no dispute with Dr.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:48.055
Jung.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:51.183
I was simply mistaken about him.

01:17:52.392 --> 01:17:55.728
I thought he was going to be able to
carry our work forward after I was gone.

01:17:55.729 --> 01:18:00.609
I didn’t bargain for all that second-rate
mysticism and self-aggrandizing shamanism.

01:18:01.985 --> 01:18:05.655
Nor did I realize he could be
so brutal and sanctimonious.

01:18:05.697 --> 01:18:09.550
He’s trying to find some way
forward so that we don’t just have

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:13.163
to tell our patients, “This is
why you are the way you are.

01:18:13.205 --> 01:18:17.584
” He wants to be able to say, “We can show
you what it is you might want to become.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.628
Playing God, in other words.

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:22.089
We have no right to do that.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:25.509
The world is as it is.

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:31.390
Understanding and accepting that
is the way to psychic health.

01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:37.604
What good can we do if our aim is simply
to replace one delusion with another?

01:18:41.566 --> 01:18:42.984
Well, I agree with you.

01:18:44.736 --> 01:18:45.529
Hm.

01:18:46.571 --> 01:18:49.740
I’ve noticed that in the crucial
areas of dispute between Dr.

01:18:49.741 --> 01:18:51.451
Jung and myself, you tend to favour me.

01:18:52.536 --> 01:18:54.538
I thought you had no dispute with him.

01:18:55.747 --> 01:18:56.623
Hm.

01:19:00.127 --> 01:19:01.461
You still love him.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.964
That’s not why I’m pleading his cause.

01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:09.350
I just feel that if you two don’t
find some way to co-exist, it will

01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:14.307
hold back the progress of
psychoanalysis, perhaps indefinitely.

01:19:15.726 --> 01:19:17.686
Is there no way to avert a rupture?

01:19:17.728 --> 01:19:22.482
Correct scientific relations
will be maintained, of course.

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:25.098
I’ll be seeing him at the
editorial meeting in

01:19:25.099 --> 01:19:27.946
Munich in September and I
shall be perfectly civil.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:33.702
To tell you the truth, what finished him
for me was all that business about you.

01:19:33.744 --> 01:19:36.455
The lies, the ruthless behaviour.

01:19:36.496 --> 01:19:38.290
I was very shocked.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.002
I think he loved me.

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:48.633
I’m afraid your idea of a mystical union with
a blond Siegfried was inevitably doomed.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:56.016
Put not your trust in Aryans.

01:19:57.768 --> 01:20:04.024
We’re Jews, my dear Miss Spielrein,
and Jews we will always be.

01:20:07.653 --> 01:20:12.211
Now, the real reason I invited
you here this evening was to ask

01:20:12.212 --> 01:20:16.412
if you’d be prepared to take
on one or two of my patients?

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:24.172
I was interested in what you
said about monotheism...

01:20:24.173 --> 01:20:27.590
that it arose historically out of
some kind of patricidal impulse.

01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:28.632
Yes.

01:20:28.674 --> 01:20:32.673
Akhnaton, who, as far as we
know, was the first to put

01:20:32.674 --> 01:20:36.599
forth the bizarre notion
that there was only one God.

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:43.229
Also had his father’s name erased and
chiseled out of all public monuments.

01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:44.481
That’s not strictly true.

01:20:45.357 --> 01:20:46.317
Not true?

01:20:46.358 --> 01:20:47.526
No.

01:20:48.903 --> 01:20:51.071
You mean it was most probably a myth?

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:52.448
No.

01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:56.768
I mean there were two perfectly straightforward
reasons for Akhnaton, or Amenhopis

01:20:56.769 --> 01:21:00.789
IV as I prefer to call him, to excise
his father’s name from the car touches.

01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:05.012
First, this was something traditionally
done by all new kings who

01:21:05.013 --> 01:21:09.256
didn’t wish their father’s name to
continue to be public currency.

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:14.887
In much the same way as your article in
the Yearbook fails to mention my name?

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.891
Your name is so well-known it hardly
seemed necessary to mention it.

01:21:18.933 --> 01:21:20.434
Do go on.

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:23.524
Secondly, Amenhopis only
struck out the first half

01:21:23.525 --> 01:21:26.572
of his father’s name,
Amenhotep, because, like the

01:21:26.573 --> 01:21:29.620
first half of his own name,
it was shared by Amon,

01:21:29.621 --> 01:21:32.488
one of the gods he was
determined to eliminate.

01:21:33.405 --> 01:21:34.281
Hm.

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:36.575
As simple as that?

01:21:36.617 --> 01:21:39.954
The explanation doesn’t
seem to me unduly simple.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:44.719
And do you think your man,
whatever you call him,

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.255
felt no hostility whatsoever
toward his father?

01:21:49.296 --> 01:21:51.548
I have no means of proof, of course.

01:21:51.549 --> 01:21:55.606
For all I know, Amenhopis may have
thought that his father’s name was quite

01:21:55.607 --> 01:21:59.557
familiar enough and that now it might
be time to make a name for himself.

01:22:19.827 --> 01:22:23.664
How sweet it must be to die.

01:22:28.169 --> 01:22:31.284
“If I may say so, dear
Professor, you make the

01:22:31.285 --> 01:22:34.466
mistake of treating your
friends like patients.

01:22:34.508 --> 01:22:39.344
This enables you to reduce them to the level
of children, so that their only choice

01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:43.893
is to become obsequious nonentities or
bullying enforcers of the party line...

01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:50.263
while you sit on the mountaintop, the infallible
father-figure and nobody dares to pluck you by

01:22:50.264 --> 01:22:56.030
the beard and say, Think about your behaviour and
then decide which one of us is the neurotic.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.740
I speak as a friend.

01:22:57.781 --> 01:22:59.283
Hm.

01:23:20.012 --> 01:23:22.097
“Your letter cannot be answered.

01:23:22.139 --> 01:23:28.019
Your claim that I treat my friends like
patients is self-evidently untrue.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:32.350
As to which of us is the neurotic,
I thought we analysts were

01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:36.820
agreed a little neurosis was
nothing whatever to be ashamed of.

01:23:36.862 --> 01:23:42.384
But a man like you, who behaves quite
abnormally and then stands there shouting at

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:47.706
the top of his voice how normal he is
does give considerable cause for concern.

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:53.796
For a long time now our relationship
has been hanging by a thread.

01:23:53.838 --> 01:23:59.593
And a thread, moreover, mostly
consisting of past disappointments.

01:24:00.219 --> 01:24:02.805
We have nothing to lose by cutting it.

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:16.986
“You will be the best judge of
what this moment means to you.

01:24:18.571 --> 01:24:19.864
The rest is silence.

01:24:47.975 --> 01:24:50.519
So good to have met you
at last, Dr. Spielrein.

01:24:51.729 --> 01:24:55.691
We did meet once before when I
was your husband’s patient.

01:24:58.277 --> 01:24:59.278
I think you’re right.

01:25:04.325 --> 01:25:06.076
Your children are glorious.

01:25:08.829 --> 01:25:09.663
Thank you.

01:25:09.664 --> 01:25:11.999
You must let us know when yours arrives.

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:13.959
I expect you want a boy.

01:25:14.001 --> 01:25:14.668
No.

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:18.756
No, my husband and I both
think we would prefer a girl.

01:25:18.797 --> 01:25:20.007
Really?

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:28.516
I wish you could help him.

01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:30.601
Why?

01:25:30.643 --> 01:25:31.227
What’s the matter?

01:25:31.228 --> 01:25:32.561
He’s not himself.

01:25:34.313 --> 01:25:37.066
He’s very confused and
bogged down with his book.

01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:39.401
He’s not sleeping.

01:25:39.443 --> 01:25:42.196
He’s not taking on any new patients.

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:46.825
He still hasn’t recovered from the violence
of his break with Professor Freud.

01:25:48.327 --> 01:25:51.997
What you’re describing is
very unlike my memory of him.

01:25:52.039 --> 01:25:56.710
If you were staying in town, I’d try to
persuade him to let you analyze him.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:05.427
I know he always set great
store by your opinion.

01:26:07.388 --> 01:26:08.889
You are taking patients now?

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:14.603
I’ve pretty much decided to
specialize in child psychology.

01:26:14.645 --> 01:26:18.398
I’m not sure if it’s a
field he approves of.

01:26:18.399 --> 01:26:20.609
I haven’t discussed it with him but...

01:26:23.946 --> 01:26:25.531
You better go and talk to him.

01:26:33.831 --> 01:26:35.833
No one can help him more than you.

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:37.918
I hope you’re right.

01:27:00.733 --> 01:27:02.443
Your children are beautiful.

01:27:08.949 --> 01:27:10.075
So you’re married.

01:27:12.286 --> 01:27:13.120
Yes.

01:27:15.748 --> 01:27:16.582
He’s a doctor?

01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:19.752
Yes.

01:27:19.793 --> 01:27:21.170
His name is Pavel Scheftel.

01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:24.256
Russian.

01:27:27.134 --> 01:27:28.636
Yes, a Russian Jew.

01:27:32.806 --> 01:27:33.766
What’s he like?

01:27:36.477 --> 01:27:37.394
Kind.

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:44.735
Good, good.

01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:48.948
Are you all right?

01:27:48.989 --> 01:27:50.241
Yes.

01:27:52.618 --> 01:27:56.038
I haven’t been sleeping very well and
I keep having this apocalyptic dream.

01:27:57.748 --> 01:28:00.417
A terrible flood from the
North Sea to the Alps.

01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:03.003
Houses washed away.

01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:05.714
Thousands of floating corpses.

01:28:07.842 --> 01:28:11.720
Eventually it comes crashing into
the lake in a great tidal wave.

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:22.565
And by this time, the water, roaring down like
some vast avalanche, has turned to blood.

01:28:24.859 --> 01:28:26.026
The blood of Europe.

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.198
What do you think it means?

01:28:34.493 --> 01:28:35.870
I’ve no idea.

01:28:37.538 --> 01:28:38.914
Unless it’s about to happen.

01:28:43.294 --> 01:28:44.295
What are your plans?

01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:48.424
We’ve been thinking of
going back to Russia.

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:51.260
As long as you leave Vienna.

01:28:54.346 --> 01:28:55.890
I spoke to him last week.

01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:57.266
I can’t believe there’s nothing to be done.

01:28:57.308 --> 01:28:58.058
There’s nothing to be done.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.995
The day he refused to discuss a
dream with me on the grounds

01:29:00.996 --> 01:29:03.606
that it might risk his authority,
I should have known.

01:29:05.649 --> 01:29:07.776
After that, for me, he had no authority.

01:29:09.737 --> 01:29:12.615
It was a blow when I discovered
you’d chosen his side.

01:29:12.656 --> 01:29:14.617
It’s not a question of sides.

01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:19.371
I have to work in the direction my instinct
tells my intelligence is the right one.

01:29:19.413 --> 01:29:21.874
Don’t forget, you cured me with his method.

01:29:23.918 --> 01:29:27.213
What he’ll never accept is that what
we understand has got us nowhere.

01:29:28.255 --> 01:29:30.174
We have to go into uncharted territory.

01:29:30.216 --> 01:29:33.761
We have to go back to the sources
of everything we believe.

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:36.407
I don’t want to just
open a door and show the

01:29:36.408 --> 01:29:39.182
patient his illness squatting
there like a toad.

01:29:39.183 --> 01:29:41.852
I want to try and find a way to
help the patient reinvent himself.

01:29:41.894 --> 01:29:44.127
To send him off on a journey
at the end of which is

01:29:44.128 --> 01:29:46.232
waiting the person he was
always intended to be.

01:29:46.273 --> 01:29:50.277
It’s no good making yourself
ill in the process.

01:29:52.696 --> 01:29:54.865
Only the wounded physician
can hope to heal.

01:30:05.626 --> 01:30:07.211
I’m told you have a new mistress.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.881
Is that right?

01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:12.550
What’s her name?

01:30:13.634 --> 01:30:14.469
Toni.

01:30:15.887 --> 01:30:17.055
Is she like me?

01:30:17.096 --> 01:30:18.181
No.

01:30:18.222 --> 01:30:19.557
She’s an ex-patient?

01:30:20.892 --> 01:30:21.517
Yes.

01:30:21.559 --> 01:30:22.185
Jewish?

01:30:24.228 --> 01:30:25.313
Half Jewish.

01:30:26.397 --> 01:30:27.774
Training to be an analyst?

01:30:27.815 --> 01:30:28.608
Yes.

01:30:29.942 --> 01:30:31.069
But she’s not like me?

01:30:33.529 --> 01:30:35.073
Of course she makes me think of you.

01:30:38.368 --> 01:30:39.702
How do you make it work?

01:30:39.744 --> 01:30:41.371
I don’t know.

01:30:43.915 --> 01:30:46.626
Emma, as you’ve seen, is the
foundation of my house.

01:30:48.711 --> 01:30:50.505
Toni is the perfume in the air.

01:30:57.762 --> 01:31:00.390
My love for you was the most
important thing in my life.

01:31:00.431 --> 01:31:06.270
For better or worse, made
me understand who I am.

01:31:16.739 --> 01:31:18.241
<music> This should be mine.

01:31:20.034 --> 01:31:20.868
Yes.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:30.294
Sometimes you have to do something
unforgivable just to be able to go on living.
