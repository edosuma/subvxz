06:22.257 --> 06:23.633
IN FIFTH GRADE

06:23.675 --> 06:25.719
THAT THAT'S PART OF

06:23.675 --> 06:25.719
YOUR REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.647
WOW.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.149

06:37.689 --> 06:39.149
IN HISTORY

06:39.191 --> 06:41.400
EVER TO PULL THAT ONE OFF.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.486
SHIT.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.197
OH, SO ACCORDING TO THE CAC,

06:45.239 --> 06:47.615
THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN

06:45.239 --> 06:47.615
IS A GODLESS ONE.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.034
AND ART REFLECTS THAT.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.744
IT MIRRORS

06:49.076 --> 06:50.744
THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

06:50.785 --> 06:54.206
DO YOU THINK THE FACT

06:50.785 --> 06:54.206
THAT YOU'RE HOMOSEXUAL

06:54.248 --> 06:58.210
MAKES YOU MORALLY BANKRUPT?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.170
I AM A PERVERT...

07:00.212 --> 07:01.546
AND ONLY A PERVERT

07:00.212 --> 07:01.546
COULD SHOW THIS WORK.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.094
I DIDN'T KNOW

07:04.883 --> 07:07.094
I WAS BEING TAPED.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.595
ANYWAY, THAT IS NOT

07:07.135 --> 07:08.595
WHAT I SAID.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.679
SHE TWISTED IT.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.181
THAT'S WHAT

07:09.721 --> 07:11.181
THEY DO.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.349
AND YOU CAN BE SURE

07:12.391 --> 07:13.558
THAT THIS TAPE

07:12.391 --> 07:13.558
HAS BEEN SENT

07:13.600 --> 07:15.518
TO EVERY

07:13.600 --> 07:15.518
CONSERVATIVE CONGRESSMAN,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.396
ALONG WITH THIS

07:15.560 --> 07:17.396
LOVELY DOCUMENT--

07:17.437 --> 07:18.646
A LIFE-SIZE PAINTING

07:18.688 --> 07:19.647
OF THE PRESIDENT

07:18.688 --> 07:19.647
OF THE UNITED STATES

07:19.689 --> 07:21.108
IN AN S.S. UNIFORM,

07:21.149 --> 07:22.442
JESUS SODOMIZING MARY,

07:22.483 --> 07:24.444
AND THIS IS A DOOZY--

07:24.485 --> 07:26.196
THIS IS A LIVE

07:24.485 --> 07:26.196
PERFORMANCE PIECE.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.281
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS ART?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.407
ABSOLUTELY.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.575
WE PUT IT TO

07:28.448 --> 07:30.575
A VOTE, BERT.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.826
IT'S AN IMPORTANT

07:30.617 --> 07:31.826
EXHIBITION,

07:31.868 --> 07:32.953
AND THE MUSEUM

07:31.868 --> 07:32.953
STANDS BEHIND IT.

07:32.994 --> 07:33.912
OKAY.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.041
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN

07:35.997 --> 07:38.041
HOW TO DEAL WITH FAE BUCKLEY.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.876
SHE WAS CAUGHT

07:38.083 --> 07:39.876
OFF-GUARD, BERT.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.336
IT COULD HAPPEN

07:39.918 --> 07:41.336
TO ANYONE.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.670
AS YOUR COUNSEL,

07:41.378 --> 07:42.670
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY WILL

07:42.712 --> 07:44.798
TRY AND GET AT YOU

07:42.712 --> 07:44.798
ON LEGAL GROUNDS.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.591
NOW, THE LAW IS PRETTY MUCH

07:44.839 --> 07:46.591
ON YOUR SIDE RIGHT NOW.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.385
HOWEVER,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.385
THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IS NOT.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.970
THERE'S TWO

07:48.427 --> 07:49.970
WAYS TO GO.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.014
ONE, THEY RANT AND RAVE

07:50.011 --> 07:53.014
WHILE WE LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.308
WE DO NOT ENGAGE.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.767
THAT IS WHAT

07:54.349 --> 07:55.767
WE'VE BEEN DOING,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.352
SITTING WITH OUR HANDS

07:55.809 --> 07:57.352
FOLDED IN OUR LAPS

07:57.394 --> 07:59.062
WHILE THEY CALL US

07:57.394 --> 07:59.062
PORNOGRAPHERS AND PEDOPHILES.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.314
THE OTHER STRATEGY

07:59.104 --> 08:00.314
IS TO MEET THEM HEAD-ON,

08:00.355 --> 08:01.731
DUKE IT OUT.
