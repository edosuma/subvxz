WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:05.953
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.131 --> 00:07.996
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.175 --> 00:11.008
Rests on the shoulders
of a young man.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.045
His name: Merlin.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.679
Arthur:
Well, this is nice, isn't it?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.935
Just the two of us.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.845
Well, three of us.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.474
Merlin? Merlin doesn't count.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.439
Don't count?

00:29.613 --> 00:32.104
Not here, not actually
speaking right now.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.487
Aren't you impressed
that I remembered our anniversary?

00:35.661 --> 00:38.368
But you didn't remember.
I reminded you over a month ago.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.373
Yes, but I remembered
that it was today...

00:43.585 --> 00:45.291
Today. “Ah

00:45.462 --> 00:48.078
- actually, I did.
- Shut up, Merlin.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.748
Heh I did.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.690
Arthur!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.542
Gaius:
You're very fortunate, sire.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.878
A fall like that,
you could've broken your neck.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.323
What about the men who attacked us?
Have they been questioned?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.588
I'm sorry, sire.
Their wounds were fatal

02:20.766 --> 02:22.631
we were unable to learn
anything from them.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.846
We know one thing. It can't have been
a coincidence that they were there.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.645
Leon: Sire.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.148
We recovered your saddle
from the forest trail

02:32.319 --> 02:34.150
the girth has been
unpicked and restitched.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.652
It was designed to break, sire.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.865
Arthur: It appears, Merlin,
on this single, solitary occasion...

02:42.537 --> 02:43.822
You may be right.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.913
Afternoon, sir knights.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.299
Horses are shod
and watered as requested.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.302
- You are tyr seward?
- I am, sir Gwaine.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.962
You know I am.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.223
- Stable hand to the king?
- That is my honor, yes.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.644
Is the king not pleased
with my work?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.723
Have I done something wrong?

03:14.903 --> 03:17.189
Are you gelda seward,
mother of tyr seward?

03:17.364 --> 03:19.946
- Yes.
Gwaine: And you live here with your son?

03:20.117 --> 03:23.951
- Is he in some kind of trouble?
- He's been arrested on suspicion of treason.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.612
No. No, that cannot be.
You've made a mistake.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.827
My tyr's as loyal to the king as you are.
Here

03:31.628 --> 03:33.994
Leon: The thread that we found
at the boy's home...

03:34.172 --> 03:38.040
Matches that used
to sabotage your saddle, sire.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.043
Who put you up to this, tyr?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.554
No one. No one's put me
up to anything, sire.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.511
Arthur:
Are you saying you acted alone?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.849
Had no help, no accomplice?

03:49.020 --> 03:51.807
I don't know anything about
these things you're talking about.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.063
I've done nothing, sire...

03:54.234 --> 03:57.067
Save look after your horse
and tack like I always do.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.818
The evidence is
staring you in the face.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.105
You can't deny it.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.984
Sire, I swear on my mother's life.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.322
Just give me their name.
Why protect them?

04:12.127 --> 04:15.415
They can't help you now.
Just give me their name.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.880
I have no name.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.790
There's no name to give.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.425
Then you leave me no choice.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.211
Though it saddens me
greatly to do so...

04:24.389 --> 04:26.004
I must charge you with treason.

04:30.729 --> 04:34.347
Is there anything further
you'd like to say?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.724
Tyr: You're my king, sire.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.237
I'd never do anything
to hurt you. Never.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.208
Tyr seward,
by the power vested in me...

04:58.381 --> 05:00.417
I hereby sentence you to death.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.144
Merlin:
How long have you known tyr?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.310
He's been in my service
since he was a boy.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.368
Do you really think
him capable of this treason?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.852
What I think is irrelevant.
The facts speak for themselves.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.532
Arthur, to sentence him to death...

05:27.702 --> 05:30.944
The law is the law, Merlin,
whether I like it or not.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.916
Why would tyr want Arthur dead?
It makes no sense.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.328
Perhaps he harbored some grudge...

05:39.506 --> 05:42.293
Some festering resentment.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.253
What grudge could he bear?
He loved his work.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.009
He was deeply proud of it.
And Arthur respected him,

05:47.180 --> 05:50.468
I know he did.
He always treated him fairly and well.

05:50.642 --> 05:54.476
Merlin, it's not always possible
to know what's in the mind of another man.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.486
Maybe so, but Arthur was
right about one thing.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.390
Tyr could not have done this alone.
Someone else is involved.

05:59.568 --> 06:03.026
And unless we find out
who they are...

06:03.488 --> 06:06.150
What's to stop them
from trying it again?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.286
Gwen: Arthur.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.707
I know you were fond of tyr,
but you had no choice.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.251
He was guilty.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.379
Tyr seward is a simple man.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.465
He can't have planned
this assassination himself.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.223
Well, I know that's
what you'd like to think.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.058
We all would.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.097
But hard as it is to accept...

06:41.276 --> 06:44.109
Even a great and honorable king
has enemies within his walls.

06:44.988 --> 06:49.357
Very often the last person
that you would suspect.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.070
Tyr is just such a person.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.449
No, you're right.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.963
I suppose experience should've
taught me that by now.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.087
The important thing is
he didn't succeed

07:09.304 --> 07:12.467
I've already lost my brother.
I couldn't bear to lose you too.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.267
I'm here, Guinevere.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.225
Always will be.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.061
I'll never leave you.
I promise you that.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.281
Thought you might
like some food.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.408
Eating is not Gaius's
strong point, as you know.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.420
Heh-heh. Well, at least it's not
that turnip stew.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.500
Thank you, Merlin.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.638
I'd like to help you, tyr, if I can.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.674
You heard the king.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.308
No one can help me now.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.310
I know you, tyr.
Whatever you did,

08:01.481 --> 08:02.846
I don't believe
you meant any harm.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.687
I didn't do anything.
On my honor, I didn't.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.602
But something happened, didn't it”?

08:10.824 --> 08:13.031
- No.
- Tyr, please.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.137
I know you're not to blame.
Just tell me what happened.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.402
No, they'll... “Who?

08:27.716 --> 08:30.173
This was a few days back.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.049
One of the horses
came down with colic,

08:32.220 --> 08:35.178
so I had to sleep in the stable
to watch over him.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.010
Go on, it's all right.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.972
That night I was woke up by a sound.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.983
There was someone there,
going over the king's saddle.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.565
I knew it wasn't right.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.156
I tried to get away
and warn someone.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.362
But they saw me.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.871
They told me if I so much as whispered
a word of what I'd seen

09:02.042 --> 09:03.703
they'd take my mother.

09:05.837 --> 09:09.170
They'd take her
and they'd cut her throat.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.594
Who was it?

09:16.765 --> 09:20.428
- I can't.
- Tyr, please tell me.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.388
This is the only chance you have.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.148
You'll be hanged if you don't.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.937
- And they'll kill my mother if I do.
- Tyr.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.446
I can help you.

09:42.624 --> 09:46.287
No. If it means me dying
instead of her...

09:46.461 --> 09:50.079
Then so be it. I'd rather die.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.090
Arthur: You went to the cells to see tyr.
Merlin: Yes.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.881
We've been over this before.
We know what he said.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.391
- The evidence doesn't lie.
- I don't deny the crime, sire...

10:04.562 --> 10:06.928
But the only part that tyr played
is to see it done.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.189
- He told you this?
- Five minutes ago.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.645
- And who was it?
- He wouldn't say.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.061
He was too frightened.
They threatened him.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.154
I must speak with him at once.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.815
Arthur, surely it can Walt.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.904
Gaius told you to rest,
let your injuries heal.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.279
Arthur: I'll be fine. I want
to hear what he has to say.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.240
And you shall, but tyr's said
all he's willing to say for now.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.328
He's clearly frightened
and unsure what to do. Don't push him.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.917
Let him think it over
and maybe after a night in the cells...

10:37.095 --> 10:39.336
Ne'll be prepared to say more.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.020
As always, Guinevere,
you're right.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.651
Merlin: Have you noticed anything
about Gwen of late?

11:04.581 --> 11:05.912
Nothing unusual. Why?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.865
I'm not sure, exactly.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.251
Something she's said?
Something she's done?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.749
No

11:14.924 --> 11:16.084
It's nothing in particular.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.298
It just seems to me
that ever since she returned.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.592
From the dark tower,
she hasn't been quite herself.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.849
Well, is that so surprising?
She lost her only brother.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.976
Elyan was all the family she had.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.021
And grief changes people, Merlin.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.184
I know they do, but...

11:36.362 --> 11:40.150
Besides, we can only guess at what
morgana put her through.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.108
That's what worries me.

12:25.036 --> 12:28.199
- Tyr.
- What are you doing here?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.205
Nothing to worry about.
I just want to talk.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.584
I've said nothing.
Shh come closer.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.380
We don't want to be heard,
do we?

12:41.719 --> 12:43.255
I've told no names.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.090
I've not mentioned you to anyone.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.471
I believe you.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.101
My mother's safe?
You've not harmed her?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.638
Your mother is alive and well.
She's not the problem.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.227
- You are.
- Me?

12:57.402 --> 13:00.064
You see, tyr, it's not
what you haven't said...

13:00.238 --> 13:01.899
It's what you may yet say.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.571
Don't...

13:08.204 --> 13:09.614
Understand?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.045
The blade punctured his heart.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.964
He suffered very little,
I'm glad to say.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.431
- You've spoken to the night patrols?
- They saw nothing unusual, sire.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.916
Arthur: What about the guards?
Why didn't they raise the alarm?

13:35.940 --> 13:39.273
Sire, I found this
in the grate in the guard room.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.145
Clary wort.
A powerful soporific, sire.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.994
I've been a fool.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.657
I should've spoken to him
when I had the chance.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.583
Arthur.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.167
What?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.004
Whoever did this was no stranger
to Camelot.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.344
They knew this citadel inside out.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.411
- Guinevere.
- The plan failed.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.243
Arthur lives.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.165
Does he suspect you?

14:41.339 --> 14:44.046
Not yet,
but the stable hand saw me.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.799
He was going to tell them everything.
“Was?

14:47.762 --> 14:49.172
You have some good news then?

14:49.347 --> 14:51.838
I did what had to be done.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.054
With tyr gone, you have to find
someone else to take the fall

14:56.270 --> 14:59.057
when Arthur dies,
you have to be beyond all suspicion.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.223
You must have the support
of the knights.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.961
Only with their allegiance will your path
to the throne be clear.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.727
But what good is all this?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.816
- Arthur's still alive.
- For now.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.481
But tonight you'll have
everything you need to finish the job.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.777
Arthur's doubled the guard.
There are patrols night and day.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.946
- I can't risk it.
- Gwen, Gwen.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.614
It is I that will come to you.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.328
(Gol

16:05.840 --> 16:07.046
(Wen!

16:08.801 --> 16:12.009
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Arthur's been beside himself with worry.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.264
Well, there was no need to worry.
I was just walking in the Meadow.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.594
Ah

16:17.768 --> 16:21.807
Since elyan died,
sometimes I just need time to myself.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.438
Well, I understand,
but you should be careful.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.100
A patrol was attacked
in the woods only an hour ago.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.395
Oh, I had no idea.
Thank you, Merlin.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.063
I'll be more careful next time.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.665
No broken bones, I'm glad to say.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.631
- Anything else you remember?
- Nothing.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.087
One minute
I was pursuing them through the trees...

16:53.262 --> 16:55.048
The next I was flat on the ground.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.839
- You're sure it's sorcery?
Gwaine: Without a doubt.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.508
- Powerful, too.
- Morgana?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.554
- It's possible, but why was she there?
Merlin: Maybe she was meeting someone.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.563
Why would she come
so close to the citadel?

17:06.733 --> 17:09.601
Maybe she had to. Maybe whoever
she was meeting was here in Camelot.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.488
Arthur: Until we have more to go on,
this is idle speculation.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.694
Gaius, Merlin, see what
you can find in the woods.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.109
Perhaps there's something
we overlooked

17:19.288 --> 17:21.744
- I'll go with them
- You'll do no such thing.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.623
You rest, Gwaine.
Physician's orders.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.751
I don't think this is over.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.214
What do you mean?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.630
Whoever's responsible
for the attack on Arthur's life

17:38.808 --> 17:40.514
what's to stop them
from trying again?

17:40.685 --> 17:43.017
Gwaine: They haven't a chance.
The citadel's on full alert.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.553
Every entrance,
every exit's being watched.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.939
Trust me. Arthur's safe as long
as he remains in Camelot.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.816
That's just it.
What if he's not safe here?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.347
What if Camelot's the most
dangerous place that he could be?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.980
Who could have access
to the stables?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.878
Who could've known
the way out to the cells?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.198
Who knew that tyr
would do anything to protect his mother?

18:05.042 --> 18:08.159
You need to stay close to Arthur
and do whatever you can to protect him.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.919
You have my word on it, Merlin.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.664
Who are you?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.450
It matters not who I am.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.542
And what is it that you want?

18:53.716 --> 18:57.300
Tincture, the power to kill.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.712
Not just to kill, but to do so slowly
and with the utmost pain.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.802
Very particular, what you seek.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.217
It has a very particular purpose.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.637
Well?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.806
Do you possess such a thing?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.817
Heh I do.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.495
- Here.
- What are they?

19:29.669 --> 19:33.878
Valerian. Two drops will render
the victim unconscious.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.959
And henbane.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.045
A single drop administered
through the ear...

19:39.220 --> 19:41.927
Their death will be as prolonged...

19:42.098 --> 19:44.931
And as unpleasant
as could be wished for.

19:45.101 --> 19:48.764
Ah. These are uncommon things.

19:48.938 --> 19:52.271
Hard to come by, hard to prepare.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.021
Oh.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.604
Very generous, my lady.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.900
More than enough to buy my wares...

20:04.078 --> 20:06.114
Not my silence.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.892
Arthur, are you all right?

20:32.189 --> 20:33.804
What if Merlin's right?

20:34.942 --> 20:38.309
What if morgana did attack the patrol?

20:38.487 --> 20:41.229
- Morgana?
- She wants me dead.

20:41.991 --> 20:45.233
What better way of achieving that than
conspiring with an ally within Camelot?

20:45.411 --> 20:48.869
An ally who she couldn't risk
meeting within these walls?

20:49.415 --> 20:51.747
Who? Whoever killed tyr.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.711
But that doesn't make sense.
If you were the target, why kill tyr?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.746
To protect their identity.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.209
Perhaps.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.875
Tyr's killer had an intimate knowledge
of the palace.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.419
Whoever they were,
they must be known to me...

21:05.598 --> 21:08.340
And they must be here
as we speak.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.936
If what you say is true,
they must be found, quickly.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.846
And if they're not,
they'll strike again.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.225
I will not let that happen.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.940
I would lay down my life
to protect you.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.783
You'll find them, Arthur,
you and I together.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.096
(Saius.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.391
Yes, it's certainly not natural.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.102
It's morgana. I'm sure of it.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.567
Gaius:
You sure we're in the right place?

22:06.742 --> 22:09.074
Merlin: Gwaine said he spotted them
somewhere around here.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.078
There, on that branch.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.368
It's not much to go on, is it?

22:22.883 --> 22:25.295
Raw imported silk.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.381
Traders ask a small fortune for it.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.844
Whoever that belongs to
is extremely wealthy.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.597
What is that,
some kind of embroidery?

22:35.771 --> 22:39.013
Indeed. Woven threads
of silver and gold.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.775
Only those of the highest rank
can afford such a thing.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.614
Merlin?

22:48.784 --> 22:51.116
Where are you going now?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.555
Arthur: Merlin.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.264
Would you care to explain
exactly what it is that you're doing?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.605
I was just checking for holes.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.024
Holes.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.826
- Yes, that's...
- Where the hand goes.

23:36.123 --> 23:39.081
Granted, but look.

23:42.671 --> 23:46.129
Mm. That I believe is
where the other hand goes.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.753
Right. The arms are the same.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.590
You can't be too careful.
A lady's modesty is at stake, after all.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.755
Is it now?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.720
Merlin, I would strongly recommend
that you start showing...

23:56.894 --> 23:59.101
A little less interest
in Guinevere's clothing...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.057
And a little more interest in mine.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.392
I think I prefer Gwen's.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.312
I'm going to do
everything in my power...

24:09.490 --> 24:12.323
To try and forget that
you ever just said that.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.485
I suggest you do the same.

24:33.722 --> 24:37.135
Just a few drops will ease
your troubles, my dear.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.098
Do you understand?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.439
Yes

24:46.610 --> 24:48.191
come.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.353
Are you prepared?

24:51.532 --> 24:53.944
Have you found someone
to take the fall?

24:54.118 --> 24:57.030
Don't worry.
I have someone in mind.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.434
Guinevere. I began
to wonder where you were.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.513
Sorry, I had some business
to attend to in town

25:26.066 --> 25:27.431
I hope you have an appetite.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.565
Mm and a thirst

25:33.407 --> 25:35.113
Arthur: What took you into town?

25:35.284 --> 25:37.240
Just delivering supplies
to those most in need.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.659
Your kindness
never ceases to amaze me.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.729
Keep your grubby hands
off my dumplings.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.796
You know, now that I think of it...

26:36.970 --> 26:39.256
We never got to have
our little celebration, did we?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.716
Yes, why was that?

26:42.351 --> 26:43.557
To us.

27:50.377 --> 27:54.837
Gaius: All the evidence suggests
that the king has been poisoned.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.339
Gwen: Certain, Gaius?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.090
Gaius: Quite certain.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.502
The sweating,
the corruption of the skin...

28:01.680 --> 28:03.796
The traces of tincture
around the ear.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.808
They all point
to the use of henbane.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.762
Is there no hope?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.272
The poison is a deadly one, milady.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.980
There may be a way
to arrest its course.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.439
But I cannot guarantee it.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.115
One thing I know for certain.
Whoever did this lives among us.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.363
Whoever did this
has betrayed us all.

28:31.001 --> 28:34.368
Someone who is free to roam
the citadel as they please.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.879
Someone who has access
to the king's stables...

28:38.050 --> 28:40.757
The king's prison...

28:42.012 --> 28:44.048
Even the king's food.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.466
There is only one I know of.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.980
Merlin

29:13.919 --> 29:16.126
How is Arthur?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.252
Gaius: There is no change.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.803
I know how you must feel
about Merlin.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.555
You must believe me
when I say how sorry I am...

29:28.725 --> 29:31.432
But the evidence
against him is overwhelming.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.140
You did what you had to do, Guinevere.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.646
You had no choice.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.980
- I understand that.
- Thank you.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.490
Is there no hope, Gaius?
None at all?

29:48.078 --> 29:49.989
I will not lie to you.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.822
Arthur's time is
nearly upon him.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.118
But until the king draws
his last breath

29:57.296 --> 29:59.412
there is always hope.

30:14.354 --> 30:18.097
You were right, Merlin.
Whatever morgana did in the dark tower...

30:18.275 --> 30:21.517
She's taken control over Gwen
and used her to get to Arthur.

30:21.695 --> 30:25.438
- Can you save him?
- The poison's too strong, too virulent.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.283
Your magic is his only hope.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.661
You need to get me
out of here, somehow.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.040
You promised you'd never leave me, Arthur.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.630
You promised.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.970
He's our strength, our heart.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.634
How can I live without him?

30:56.980 --> 30:58.891
How can any of us live without him?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.390
Because we must.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.779
My lady, if Arthur is to die,
we will lose more than that.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.857
The kingdom will lose its king.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.652
While Arthur lives,
there is still a king of Camelot.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.663
But when the time comes, and it...

31:16.833 --> 31:21.042
It will surely come soon.
We need to be prepared.

31:21.213 --> 31:25.957
If we do not have a leader
and a guide...

31:26.134 --> 31:29.467
Camelot and all the kingdom
will be vulnerable

31:29.638 --> 31:33.472
everything Arthur worked
so hard to achieve will be threatened.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.721
But who could wear his crown?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.683
He's no family to succeed him.

31:41.817 --> 31:46.231
And who among us is
worthy of such a thing?

31:46.947 --> 31:48.812
You are, my lady.

31:52.452 --> 31:56.411
- Me??
- You are as close to family as Arthur has.

31:58.417 --> 32:03.286
No one can deny your wisdom,
your compassion and your loyalty.

32:04.798 --> 32:08.666
I am certain were Arthur
able to make this decision.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.425
He would chose you.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.171
I don't know what to say.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.841
I realize that this is
a great responsibility...

32:18.019 --> 32:20.226
But you will not be alone.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.434
I guarantee you myself
and all the knights will stand by you...

32:26.611 --> 32:29.102
Now and forever.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.195
Thank you, Leon.

32:34.369 --> 32:37.361
I am lucky indeed
to have such friends.

33:09.321 --> 33:14.031
- Who are you?
- What kind of a damn fool question is that?

33:14.201 --> 33:16.442
I am who I am
and I am who I was.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.702
And I am who I will always be.

33:18.872 --> 33:23.707
That's no answer.
“What other answer is there?

33:23.877 --> 33:26.084
It's the only answer worth giving.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.712
What are you doing here?
Incredible.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.046
You follow one idiot question
with another!

33:33.220 --> 33:35.336
I'm visiting the cells...

33:35.514 --> 33:38.005
As you perfectly well know.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.970
No, you're not.
Not unless we say so, you're not.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.429
But you already said so.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.185
Only 10 minutes ago you said so.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.267
You said so and I did so!

33:46.441 --> 33:49.683
- No, we didn't.
- What on earth is wrong with you?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.022
Something interesting
in your tea, is there?

33:52.197 --> 33:55.564
It's hardly any wonder
your prisoners are being murdered...

33:55.742 --> 33:58.358
If you can't even remember
who you're letting in...

33:58.537 --> 34:01.574
And who you're letting out!
You let me in!

34:01.748 --> 34:03.033
And I thank you for that.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.700
And now, apparently,
I have to let myself out!

34:06.878 --> 34:08.414
Ah!

34:08.588 --> 34:10.795
Goodbye!

34:24.728 --> 34:27.014
You! What are you doing
in my kitchen?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.647
- Nothing.
- "Nothing" means "mischief" in my book.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.478
Well, you've been reading
the wrong book.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.572
- And "mischief" means "theft."
- No, it doesn't.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.978
And theft means my pies.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.943
Your pies?

34:38.118 --> 34:40.780
Why on earth
would anyone want to steal...

34:40.954 --> 34:43.036
Your godforsaken pies?

34:43.206 --> 34:45.447
My pies are the talk of Camelot.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.708
Oh. Yes, indeed they are.

34:48.878 --> 34:53.417
A crust like rusted iron,
a filling like last year's horse dung.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.585
And the smell. Oh yes,
just like the guard house's latrine!

34:57.762 --> 35:00.504
No one insults my pies
and gets away with it!

35:00.682 --> 35:04.140
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I speak instead
of your poisonous flans...

35:04.311 --> 35:08.054
Llkke vomit, curdling
in the noonday sun?

35:08.231 --> 35:11.314
Or your dumplings?
The king himself...

35:11.484 --> 35:15.022
Likened them to freshly lain
frog spawn wrapped in pig snot!

35:15.196 --> 35:17.983
What would you know about
the king and my dumplings?

35:18.158 --> 35:19.489
Oh, good grief.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.278
Should've done that years ago.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.222
You there!

35:52.317 --> 35:53.432
You! Halt!

35:59.616 --> 36:01.322
There! This way!

36:19.719 --> 36:22.051
He's gone. We've lost him.

36:22.222 --> 36:26.340
Inform the men we have an intruder.
Put the citadel on high alert.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.102
That was no wind.
It was sorcery.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.848
Light the braziers!
Search the courtyard!

37:34.753 --> 37:36.584
Are you all right? Gwen: Yes.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.087
You haven't seen anything,
heard anything?

37:39.257 --> 37:42.249
Gwen: Nothing, why? Gwaine: There's
an intruder within our walls.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.463
- Here in the citadel?
- Yes, milady.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.344
We last saw them in the main square
before we lost sight of them.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.221
My lady, you may be in danger.

37:49.392 --> 37:53.101
Gwaine will take you to the guest chambers.
He'll insure no harm comes to you there.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.479
Gwen: Why would anyone wish me harm?
Gaius: You are to be our leader, Gwen.

37:56.649 --> 37:57.855
You are Camelot's future.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.392
Do you imagine our enemies
don't want you dead?

38:00.570 --> 38:02.185
I can't leave Arthur, not now.

38:02.363 --> 38:07.824
Gaius: Gwen, I promise if there's
any change, I'll fetch you at once.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.076
Gwaine:
Gaius is right. Come, milady.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.487
You're not safe here.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.538
- How on earth did you get in here?
- Don't even ask.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.544
How is he?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.629
His heart is nearly stopped.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.635
I fear he's close to death

38:32.769 --> 38:34.475
The sickness is so deep in him.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.894
I don't know if I have the power
to bring him back.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.275
You can do this, Merlin.

39:41.754 --> 39:42.994
(Saius.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.712
- Merlin.
- Ha-ha-ha!

39:48.887 --> 39:52.175
Well done, Merlin. Well done!

39:56.728 --> 39:59.219
You'd better get back to the cells
before you're missed.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.309
But there are guards on every floor.
How am I gonna get back down there?

40:02.483 --> 40:04.519
Well, the same way
as you came up, obviously.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.855
Obviously.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.830
Morning, Merlin.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.294
If you've got a moment,
the king would like a word.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.930
Arthur: Merlin.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.520
This is one of the two,
possibly three...

40:46.694 --> 40:49.174
Moments in my life where I've actually
been glad to see you.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.656
That's my thoughts exactly, sire.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.316
How are you feeling?

40:55.495 --> 40:57.611
Like death. Mm.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.905
Well, death warmed up, at least.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.157
- I can imagine.
- Mm_

41:03.336 --> 41:06.373
Well, it seems like we've both been through
something of an ordeal.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.256
Well, it wasn't so bad, really...

41:10.426 --> 41:12.546
Once you get used
to the eternal night, the rats...

41:12.720 --> 41:15.086
The moldy pillars and living
with a bucket of your own...

41:15.264 --> 41:18.222
- Merlin.
- Heh-heh.

41:18.393 --> 41:21.476
I'm sorry about
what happened to you, truly.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.566
As soon as I heard, I told them it couldn't
have been you who poisoned me.

41:24.649 --> 41:28.016
Had the cook confirm your alibi.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.730
Thank you.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.021
I told them you weren't bright enough
to organize an assassination attempt.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.531
That's very thoughtful.
You're welcome.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.530
- Arthur?
- Hm?

41:38.705 --> 41:40.745
There is something that
I need to talk to you about.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.990
Sorry, Merlin, another time. They're
waiting for me in the council chambers.

41:44.168 --> 41:48.411
Thanks to Guinevere,
some new evidence has come to light.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.336
The queen found
these vials in my chambers.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.130
They bear, as you can see,
3 distinctive Mark.

42:00.476 --> 42:04.936
Thanks to her tireless efforts
she's been able to trace them.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.644
This is your Mark, is it not?
It is my Mark, yes.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.433
What does this vial contain?

42:10.611 --> 42:13.899
Valerian, sire.
“What does it do?

42:14.073 --> 42:17.657
It renders the subject unconscious.

42:17.827 --> 42:20.694
- This one?
- Henbane.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.908
It's poison, my lord.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.619
A lethal poison.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.660
And it is only thanks
to the great skill of my physician...

42:28.838 --> 42:31.124
That I am still alive.
Apothecary: I am sorry, my lord.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.039
I supplied it, I confess...

42:33.217 --> 42:37.005
But I did not know that
it was intended for you. In truth, I was...

42:37.180 --> 42:39.296
I was too afraid to ask.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.590
To afraid to ask who?

42:41.768 --> 42:44.680
She who procured it.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.354
And did you recognize this woman?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.606
Well, I cannot say for certain...

42:50.777 --> 42:54.520
But I believed it
to be morgana pendragon.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.788
Because of the queen's diligence,
the truth has been uncovered

43:11.881 --> 43:14.668
each and every one of us
owes her a great debt.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.293
Long live the queen.

43:19.472 --> 43:23.385
Crowd:
Long live the queen! Long live the queen!

43:24.143 --> 43:28.637
Long live the queen!
Long live the queen!

43:28.815 --> 43:33.935
Long live the queen!
Long live the queen!

43:34.112 --> 43:36.444
Long live the queen!

43:36.614 --> 43:38.650
Long live the queen!

43:47.834 --> 43:49.620
Man:
You're not happy with your husband?

43:49.794 --> 43:51.375
I'd be happy if he died tomorrow.
