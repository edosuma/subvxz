00:26.287 --> 00:28.419
- Ms. Palma,
you claimed my client

00:28.463 --> 00:30.204
groped you on the dance floor?

00:30.247 --> 00:32.467
- Yes, I had to smack him away.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.121
- With one hand,
because your other hand

00:34.164 --> 00:35.557
was holding a vodka and soda?

00:35.600 --> 00:38.777
How many drinks in
were you at this party?

00:38.821 --> 00:41.737
- Objection, Valentina Palma
isn't on trial here.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.086
Ian Hunter is.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.218
- Testing my patience,
Ms. Calhoun.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.828
- Moving on.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.309
After my client groped you,

00:48.352 --> 00:51.399
didn't you ask him
for a ride home?

00:51.442 --> 00:53.096
- It was late.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.751
I didn't feel safe
taking the subway to the Bronx.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.406
- And did Ian drive you home?

00:58.449 --> 01:00.538
- Yes, but to his house,
not mine.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.323
- To his parents' house
in West Hampton.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.586
Why didn't you tell him
to turn around?

01:04.629 --> 01:06.805
- I fell asleep in the car.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.677
- But you were awake enough
to enter his beach house

01:08.720 --> 01:11.375
and have sex.
- It wasn't sex.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.639
I said no.
- No to getting in his car?

01:14.683 --> 01:17.555
No to going in the house?

01:17.599 --> 01:20.384
Or no to having sex

01:20.428 --> 01:21.777
you didn't realize
had raped you

01:21.820 --> 01:24.214

- Objection, badgering.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.781
- Sustained.
Last time, Counselor.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.304
- It was two months, wasn't it?

01:27.348 --> 01:29.785
- Yes, but I--

01:48.195 --> 01:50.327
It's 15 years for rape

Calhoun's defending him.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.511
It makes me nervous.

02:00.555 --> 02:04.167
- As we both know,
the fact that Valentina

02:04.211 --> 02:08.563
didn't disclose for two months
is not at all unusual.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.653
- If that's true, why didn't
Manhattan take the case?

02:11.696 --> 02:13.611
- Because the more serious
charges were here.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.223
- Not because your DA knew
you had no real evidence?

02:16.266 --> 02:18.225
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.618
Thank you, Captain Benson.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.405
- Prosecution rests.
- Very well.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.363
Defense ready to proceed?
- We are.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.279
But at this time, we move
for a trial order motion

02:29.323 --> 02:30.498
for dismissal.

02:30.541 --> 02:33.196
Prosecution failed
to make a case.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.807
No rape kit,
delayed police report--

02:35.851 --> 02:37.200
- Thank you, Counselor.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.724
I'll consider your motion
during recess.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.553
- Is that motion bad?
- No, it's a routine move.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.207
Defense attorneys
do it at every trial.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.818
- It's a Hail Mary.
Rita Calhoun is worried.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.299
She knows that
if she puts Ian on the stand,

02:49.343 --> 02:51.910
the jury is gonna see
right through his smirk.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.783
- Todo está bien, Valentina.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.830
- So your friend Rita, huh?

02:58.874 --> 03:00.658
I think she grew another
dorsal fin during quarantine.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.833

03:01.877 --> 03:04.271
I think that
she just had it sharpened.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.881
- Judge Gallagher
wants everybody in.

03:09.493 --> 03:12.757
- In "he said, she said" cases,
almost by definition,

03:12.801 --> 03:14.977
there is reasonable doubt.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.501
Before this accusation,
this exemplary young man

03:17.545 --> 03:19.024
Ian Hunter,
had already been accepted

03:19.068 --> 03:22.332
to Vanderbilt Law School,
but you, Ms. Palma,

03:22.376 --> 03:25.335
disrespected your scholarship
to Tompkins Square University

03:25.379 --> 03:26.989
by binge drinking at a party.

03:27.032 --> 03:30.297
Then, after asking Mr. Hunter
for a ride home

03:30.340 --> 03:32.951
and willingly entering
his house,

03:32.995 --> 03:35.519
you waited two months to decide
you'd been raped.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.347
I have no way of knowing

03:37.391 --> 03:38.696
what actually happened
that night,

03:38.740 --> 03:41.656
but I do know
that I can't let this court

03:41.699 --> 03:44.441
cavalierly destroy
Mr. Hunter's future.

03:44.485 --> 03:48.271
I've heard the evidence
presented by the prosecution,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.665
and I find it
legally insufficient

03:50.708 --> 03:53.624
to establish
the offense charge therein,

03:53.668 --> 03:56.497
therefore I am granting
the defense motion

03:56.540 --> 03:58.803
to dismiss the indictment.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.940
- Thank you, Judge Gallagher.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.289
- He can't do that, can he?

04:06.333 --> 04:08.465
- He can try,
but it doesn't mean

04:08.509 --> 04:09.901
that he's gonna
get away with it.

04:09.945 --> 04:13.427

- Yeah, first year,

06:02.971 --> 06:04.102
he had four high profile
rape convictions,

06:04.146 --> 06:06.191

He never bussed a tray once,

his campaign,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.110

08:08.052 --> 08:10.838

Chip, his frat brothers.

Then they basically told me I
shouldn't let one drunken night

10:13.438 --> 10:15.136

10:17.007 --> 10:18.400
there might be a record.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.749

10:19.793 --> 10:22.099

a revolving door lately,

10:32.327 --> 10:34.111
teaching
constitutional law here.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.939
We think the world of him.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.205
- Well, it doesn't seem
like your students agree.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.294
- I can't say I entirely
disagree with them.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.036
The ruling in the Suffolk case
was upsetting.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.690
Frankly, I wish
the Manhattan DA

10:47.734 --> 10:49.257
had prosecuted the case.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.215
- That was a decision
beyond my pay grade.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.522
- I imagine
there's a lot of those.

10:53.565 --> 10:56.351
Anyway, if you're vetting him
for his AG run,

10:56.394 --> 10:59.180
I can assure you
there have been no complaints

10:59.223 --> 11:01.356
about him here.
- As a professor.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.402
And I realize this is
before your time here,

11:04.446 --> 11:06.013
but do you know anything

11:06.056 --> 11:09.016
about his record
as an undergrad?

11:09.059 --> 11:12.454
- You're fishing for something.
You want to give me a hint?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.807
- There may have been
a sexual misconduct claim

11:17.851 --> 11:20.244
filed against him
when he was at Tau Omega.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724
- This would have been
in the '90s.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.118
- Yes.
- I'll look into it.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.510
- Thank you.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.077
- But I doubt
we'll find anything,

11:27.121 --> 11:29.036
given his character
and, frankly,

11:29.079 --> 11:30.341
the way complaints
were handled back then--

11:30.385 --> 11:34.215
- I would appreciate any help.
- Of course.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.047
- You get anything, captain?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.918
- Well, President DuBois agreed

11:41.962 --> 11:44.355
to look into April's
accusations against the judge.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.879
- And you believe her?
- I don't know.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.271
I mean, she said
all the right things,

11:47.315 --> 11:49.534
but that's why they hired her.

11:49.578 --> 11:50.927
- Ask Carisi for a warrant.

11:50.971 --> 11:53.843
- I think that'll raise
a red flag.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.282
- There might be a better way.

11:58.326 --> 12:01.416
- Working campus police,
I got more bennies

12:01.459 --> 12:03.070
than even you guys.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.028
Three kids, free tuition.

12:05.072 --> 12:08.118
My third's a senior,
protesting that judge.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.164
- Actually,
he's why we're here.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.426
Any chance you were
on the job

12:11.469 --> 12:13.254
back when Gallagher
was a undergrad?

12:13.297 --> 12:14.472
- My first year.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.909
- You know he was accused
of raping a girl

12:15.952 --> 12:17.432
your daughter's age?

12:17.475 --> 12:19.042
- Listen, I can't talk
to you, man.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.435
You gotta go
through administration.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.089
- You know how that goes.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.438
Any chance you got
any of your memo books

12:23.481 --> 12:26.615
from back in the day?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.835
The victim's name
was April Kelly.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.401
- Sorry, I gotta go, Officer.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.621
I drive my daughter home
every day.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.493
- You can never be too safe
with a college girl.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.367
- I wish I could have
been more help, man.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.936
- Hey, if anything comes up.
- Hi, Dad.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.895
- Hey.
- Hello, Officer.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.336
<i>- Investigating
a decades old assault charge</i>

12:52.380 --> 12:54.904
on Judge Gallagher
with a reluctant victim

12:54.948 --> 12:56.297
seems an overreach.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.428
- He's running
for attorney general.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.256
His victim disclosed
to me at the time.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.433
- Chief, I spoke to her myself.
She's credible.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.087
- And her case
is outside the statute.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.916
- This guy is a predator
who protects other predators.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.310
If we keep digging,
we're gonna find more victims.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.965
- Sorry, sir, I told him
you were in a meeting.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.488
- My fault, Chief.
It's important.

13:13.531 --> 13:17.057
I'd appreciate a few minutes.
- Of course, Judge.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.407
It's okay, Celia.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.322
- So these are my accusers?

13:21.365 --> 13:26.675
Captain, Counselor, and Isaiah.
Et tu, busboy?

13:26.718 --> 13:28.329
- Been a long time, Chip.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.939
- Counselor Holmes
and I go way back

13:29.983 --> 13:32.507
when he was slinging
fish sticks.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.900
He knows
I have nothing to hide.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.336
You have questions,
you should have come to me.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.511
- Just due diligence,
Your Honor.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.991
- This because you
just lost your case

13:38.034 --> 13:39.253
or because I'm running for AG?

13:39.296 --> 13:41.995
- We have
a credible accusation.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.171
- Credible or ginned up?

13:44.214 --> 13:46.390
In this environment,
any woman can say anything.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.565
If you have
political opponents,

13:47.609 --> 13:48.958
they'll run with it.

13:49.002 --> 13:52.919
- Well, if that's the case,
then we'll find out.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.138
- Before or after
you've achieved

13:55.182 --> 13:57.575
your true goal to tar me?

13:57.619 --> 13:58.968
-

13:59.012 --> 14:00.448
That's not what
this is about, Judge.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.580
- You're gonna sit there
and tell me these three

14:02.624 --> 14:04.365
aren't biased against me?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.236
You're a smart guy.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.239
Think you'd know a hanging jury
when you see one.

14:12.286 --> 14:19.293
<i>♪</i>

14:23.775 --> 14:26.169
- Thanks for calling.

14:26.213 --> 14:29.477
- Wasn't my idea.
- Well, thank your daughter.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.088
- Went through
some old boxes in my garage,

14:32.132 --> 14:35.396
found a bunch
of old memo books, but...

14:35.439 --> 14:37.615
- I didn't get 'em from you.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.356
- And his other two victims
I found,

14:39.400 --> 14:42.359
you didn't get those
from me either.

14:42.403 --> 14:45.449
- Understood.

14:45.493 --> 14:52.500
<i>♪</i>

14:58.462 --> 15:00.900
- So how did you guys
hear about my case?

15:00.943 --> 15:03.467
Hudson U just treated me
like I was toxic waste.

15:03.511 --> 15:07.341
- Well, somebody who cared
came forward.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.605
Look, if you feel
uncomfortable at all,

15:10.648 --> 15:12.694
or if you don't remember
the details--

15:12.737 --> 15:14.957
- Oh, I remember the details.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.352
Chip Gallagher assaulted me.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.962
- So can you tell us
what happened?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.399
- I passed out at a party,

15:22.443 --> 15:24.097
woke up with his thing
in my hand,

15:24.140 --> 15:26.490
and the whole room
was laughing.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.579
- Did you report Gallagher?
- The next day.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.669
They took statements
from everybody in the room,

15:31.713 --> 15:35.499
Chip's pals,
my so-called friends.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.067
They all backed Chip,
just like with April.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.026
- So you knew about April.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.899
- When April heard about it,
she reached out,

15:43.943 --> 15:46.380
told me what Gallagher
did to her.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.035
At least it made me feel
like I wasn't crazy.

15:50.732 --> 15:54.518
- If we can make a case
against Gallagher,

15:54.562 --> 15:56.520
would you be willing
to testify?

15:56.564 --> 15:57.869
- Isn't it too long ago?

15:57.913 --> 16:00.002
- We wouldn't be able
to prosecute your case,

16:00.046 --> 16:03.397
but this is still
an open investigation,

16:03.440 --> 16:08.097
so his conduct with you would
certainly speak to pattern.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.493
- If you say so.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.886
In my opinion,
guys like Gallagher,

16:14.930 --> 16:17.541
they've been
above the law for so long,

16:17.585 --> 16:19.891
nothing touches them.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.679
- I was a freshman.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.508
I couldn't believe I was
invited to a Hamptons party.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.901
I had some drinks.

16:29.945 --> 16:34.471
I woke up on a boat naked
and alone with Chip Gallagher.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.082
I was scared.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.128
I begged Chip to take us back.
- And what did he say?

16:39.172 --> 16:42.827
- He said I had two choices--
hump or jump.

16:42.871 --> 16:43.959
- I'm so sorry.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.048
- I was a city kid.
I couldn't swim.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.702
At least it was over fast.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.052
- Did you ever file
a police report?

16:50.096 --> 16:53.055
- Hudson U said it was
a campus security matter.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.230
When you're on financial aid,

16:54.274 --> 16:55.579
you do what the school
tells you.

16:55.623 --> 16:56.928
- So they told you
they'd look into it

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
and not to go to the police.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.976
- Would you be willing
to testify against him?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.891
- I'm a court reporter.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.067
For the past 15 years,
I've taken the testimony

17:05.111 --> 17:08.592
of every skeeze, sleaze,
and scumbag they make.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.768
My dream--
someone else typing

17:10.812 --> 17:12.944
while I testify
against Chip Gallagher.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.210
- So April is still reluctant,

17:17.253 --> 17:19.777
but Francine is willing,

17:19.821 --> 17:23.259
and Carmen has already given
an interview to Buzzfeed

17:23.303 --> 17:25.000
about how she was
sexually assaulted

17:25.044 --> 17:27.133
by Gallagher as an undergrad.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.004
- And we've got
campus police memo books

17:29.048 --> 17:30.658
to back 'em up.
- Okay, it's a start.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.094
It goes to pattern,
but I still need a case

17:32.138 --> 17:33.443
within the statute.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
- Also going to pattern,
Gallagher only chooses

17:35.532 --> 17:38.187
women from lower classes--
on scholarships, ethnic.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.102
- So we look for more women
in his orbit

17:40.146 --> 17:42.191
that fit that profile.
- Well, you better move fast.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.237
Gallagher's circling
the wagons.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.979
<i>- With us today
are ten lawyers</i>

17:48.023 --> 17:50.025
<i>who've been mentored
by Judge Gallagher</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:53.855
<i>as interns,
clerks, or students.</i>

17:53.898 --> 17:56.031
<i>Each of these women
has signed a statement</i>

17:56.075 --> 17:59.991
<i>attesting that the judge is
a man of impeccable character</i>

18:00.035 --> 18:01.993
<i>incapable of
the kind of behavior</i>

18:02.037 --> 18:04.518
<i>he has been
falsely accused of.</i>

18:04.561 --> 18:06.955
- Calhoun is defending
Gallagher now.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.523
So there really is no bottom.
- Or shame.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.177
She just argued
a case in front of him.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.745
<i>- I pride myself on having
created opportunities</i>

18:14.789 --> 18:16.921
<i>for women
throughout my career.</i>

18:16.965 --> 18:20.882
<i>If I stand for anything,
it's for equity and fairness.</i>

18:20.925 --> 18:25.539
<i>I don't see
gender, race, or creed.</i>

18:25.582 --> 18:27.845
- All right, well,
he doesn't see class or color,

18:27.889 --> 18:29.151
but when I look
at that screen,

18:29.195 --> 18:31.022
all I see are white women
of privilege.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.807
- So we know
he's not raping them.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.678
- But these guys call in favors

18:34.722 --> 18:36.027
from women
they haven't assaulted.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.290
We've seen that move before.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.335
- All right,
then we need to find the women

18:39.379 --> 18:41.903
that didn't
sign that statement.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.691
- This was over ten years ago.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.780
I can guess why you're here,
and I can tell you right now

18:49.824 --> 18:51.304
I can't help you.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.176
- You weren't a part of
Gallagher's press conference.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.873
- I just made junior partner
at my firm.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.048
I didn't have the time.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.572
- Maybe it's because Gallagher

18:58.615 --> 19:00.051
was less of a gentleman
with you.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.793
- He was my professor,
my mentor.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.621
- And you're saying
he wasn't hands on?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.362
- I wouldn't be here today
earning high six figures

19:06.406 --> 19:07.929
without his referral.

19:07.972 --> 19:11.106
- You should be very proud,
a girl from the Pink Houses.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.065
- I am.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.676
I moved my moms
out of the projects

19:15.719 --> 19:17.373
in Brownsville
into a brownstone I now own.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.853
- You're afraid
all that'll go away

19:18.896 --> 19:20.376
if you let people think

19:20.420 --> 19:22.248
that you slept
with your professor?

19:23.118 --> 19:25.164
- I was talking
to your partner.

19:25.207 --> 19:29.168
- He's my boss,
but maybe you and I have...

19:31.387 --> 19:34.085
More in common
than you think.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.783
I had to leave
my first job, my hometown,

19:35.826 --> 19:37.785
because of a guy
like Gallagher.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.267
- Then you know
I didn't sleep with him.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.225
- Yeah.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.751
- He said
he needed an assistant

19:47.795 --> 19:50.363
on a fast track to clerk.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.235
Didn't matter that I was
one of his best students.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.715
I had a choice

19:54.758 --> 19:56.804
between failing his class
or acing it

19:56.847 --> 19:58.022
with a law school
recommendation

19:58.066 --> 19:59.546
and a clerkship
that led to this job--

19:59.589 --> 20:01.939
- Maya, you don't need me
to tell you that that's rape.

20:01.983 --> 20:05.247
- Maybe rape three,
but that's a tough case,

20:05.291 --> 20:08.816
and it might put
my partnership at risk.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.775
- Maya, I can't tell you
what to do,

20:11.819 --> 20:13.908

a sister from Brownsville

20:13.951 --> 20:15.692

from a fight

20:15.736 --> 20:18.129

had done her wrong.

he went to college with

20:25.049 --> 20:27.269

20:27.313 --> 20:29.967

unsubstantiated accusations.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.319
This isn't an investigation.
It's a political inquisition.

any way you want.

We found these women.
They didn't come to us.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.066

to trial on this tomorrow.

- Correct me
if I'm wrong, Counselor.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.374
You went to Fordham Law
night school?

20:45.418 --> 20:49.335
You've been a ADA for a year?
- Hold on, Your Honor.

20:49.378 --> 20:52.163
Neither of you like my client,
but let's face it.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.295
If you had a viable case,

20:53.339 --> 20:54.775
you'd have already
perp walked him,

20:54.818 --> 20:57.038

not to proceed

21:00.215 --> 21:02.826
if Judge Gallagher agrees
to drop out of the AG race.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.175
- What the hell
are you talking about?

21:04.219 --> 21:06.003

from the bench.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.962

21:08.005 --> 21:11.008
I have asked the judge to give
you the benefit of the doubt,

21:11.052 --> 21:14.055
but these overt ideological
and personal attacks

21:14.098 --> 21:15.535

21:15.578 --> 21:18.799

and this is not political.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.454
Your client is a rapist.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.021
- The only reason
that he's getting off

21:24.065 --> 21:25.762
on a complete walk
is because the DA

21:25.806 --> 21:27.373

like he's interfering

21:27.416 --> 21:29.853

take that to mean?

I reported it to Hudson U.
They said they would handle it.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.836
- And did they?
- No.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.315
After they investigated,

30:39.359 --> 30:42.362
they declared
the case unfounded.

30:43.319 --> 30:44.755
- Thank you, Ms. Kelly.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.758
- Ms. Kelly, why do you think

30:47.802 --> 30:52.763
Hudson believed this encounter
was consensual?

30:52.807 --> 30:54.287
- I don't know.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.332
- Was it because none of
the supposed witnesses to this

30:56.376 --> 30:58.682
backed you up?
- They were his frat buddies.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.337
- Didn't campus police
interview two of your friends

31:01.381 --> 31:03.470
who said they saw no rape?

31:03.513 --> 31:06.952
- They weren't in the bathroom.
- Okay.

31:06.995 --> 31:10.303
You were drinking.
- Yes, I said that--one drink.

31:10.346 --> 31:14.611
- And you don't remember how
you got on that bathroom floor?

31:14.655 --> 31:15.786
- No.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.398
- So isn't it possible
you don't remember

31:18.441 --> 31:21.183
initiating
the sexual encounter?

31:21.227 --> 31:22.837
- Objection.
- Overruled.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.839
- I didn't.
He raped me.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.667
- But no rape kit,
no police report.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.235
- Well, they told me
if I reported it to the police,

31:29.278 --> 31:30.845
it could jeopardize
my scholarship.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.848
- And did you report this
to anyone?

31:33.892 --> 31:37.373
- I told a classmate--
Isaiah Holmes.

31:37.417 --> 31:41.464
- And did Mr. Holmes
do anything on your behalf?

31:41.508 --> 31:45.425
Did he report what you
supposedly told him?

31:45.468 --> 31:47.688
- I did tell him!

31:47.731 --> 31:52.823
Chip Gallagher raped me.
He ruined my life.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.782
I was gonna be a lawyer.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.915
- Were you?

31:56.958 --> 32:00.701
You failed out of Hudson.
This was 30 years ago.

32:00.744 --> 32:04.574
Isn't it possible
that you ruined your life

32:04.618 --> 32:05.749
all by yourself?

32:05.793 --> 32:07.708
- Objection,
badgering the witness.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.624
- Rephrase.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.931
You're unhappy with your life.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.281
Isn't it possible
you're looking

32:15.324 --> 32:17.979
for someone else to blame?
- I can't do this!

32:18.023 --> 32:19.763
I can't.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.417
- Your honor, request a recess.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.506
- I'm not finished with my line
of questioning, Your Honor.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.813
- I think the witness is.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.468
-

32:38.608 --> 32:40.045
- I tried to talk to April.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.655
She said she wished
I never brought any of this up.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.962
- I was the one that came
to you in the first place.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.746
- I thought I could
make things right,

32:45.789 --> 32:47.356
but I could not
help April today

32:47.400 --> 32:50.272
any more than I could
30 years ago.

32:50.316 --> 32:53.014
- You could testify to that.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
- I was in the courtroom
to be supportive of her.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.497
Calhoun will claim that taints
any testimony I give.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.629
- She will, but let me
take it to the judge.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.023
You were an outcry witness.
That has to carry weight.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.939
- And you think that'll make
any difference to the jury?

33:04.983 --> 33:07.637
- It'll make a difference
to Gallagher.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.296
When did April Kelly
tell you

33:14.340 --> 33:16.951
that she had been raped
by Chip Gallagher?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.954
- Your Honor, approach?

33:23.653 --> 33:25.829
Again, I object
to this witness.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.788
How do we know
Mr. Holmes' testimony

33:27.831 --> 33:29.137
hasn't been tailored to confirm

33:29.181 --> 33:32.010
what he heard
April Kelly claim on the stand?

33:32.053 --> 33:33.533
- We went over this
in chambers, Your Honor.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.405
- Ms. Calhoun, your objection
is on the record.

33:36.449 --> 33:39.060
You will have the opportunity
to cross-examine on that point,

33:39.104 --> 33:42.629
and, as I said,
I will remind the jury

33:42.672 --> 33:44.457
that when they evaluate
this testimony,

33:44.500 --> 33:47.808
they need to take Mr. Holmes'
earlier presence into account.

33:47.851 --> 33:50.506
Step back.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.381
You may proceed, Mr. Holmes.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.643
- April told me the next day.

33:56.686 --> 34:00.429
She was distraught, broken,
I'd say.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.778
I knew she was
telling the truth.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.606
- Was there another reason
that you believed her?

34:03.650 --> 34:05.739
- Yes, that morning
while serving them

34:05.782 --> 34:07.741
in the frat dining hall,
I heard Chip bragging

34:07.784 --> 34:11.136
about what he'd done to April.
- In front of you?

34:11.179 --> 34:12.659
- I believe
they were accustomed

34:12.702 --> 34:13.834
to not noticing the help.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.923
- And did you say anything
to Gallagher?

34:15.966 --> 34:18.099
- I tried to confront him.
- You tried?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.841
- I was a confused kid
in college,

34:20.884 --> 34:23.148
unsure of my own racial
and sexual identity.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.845
- Objection.
Relevance?

34:24.888 --> 34:26.499
- I'm getting to that,
Your Honor.

34:26.542 --> 34:30.720
What happened when you
confronted Mr. Gallagher?

34:30.764 --> 34:32.766
- He just smirked.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.202
Then he said,
if I reported him,

34:34.246 --> 34:35.769
he would tell everyone I was
"not just a half-breed

34:35.812 --> 34:39.033
but a homo," and that
he knew the school trustees.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.644
He could kill my scholarship
in a phone call.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.081
- Mm.

34:43.124 --> 34:47.433
And so you did not support
April's accusation?

34:48.738 --> 34:52.481
- No, to my lasting shame.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.702
- And even today,
is testifying

34:55.745 --> 34:58.139
against a sitting judge,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.098
a candidate
for state attorney general,

35:00.141 --> 35:03.188
a good career move for
an assistant district attorney?

35:03.231 --> 35:05.886
- I wouldn't think so.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.584
- So why are you
testifying today?

35:10.020 --> 35:12.545
- I am trying to right

35:12.588 --> 35:16.679
the worst moral lapse
of my life--

35:16.723 --> 35:18.725
my silence.

35:20.944 --> 35:23.164
My failure to come forward
on April's behalf

35:23.208 --> 35:25.732
haunts me to this day.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.140
- Okay, Tommy, hold the fort.
This'll all be over soon.

35:45.055 --> 35:49.190
- Isaiah,
looking a little pasty.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.584
Trying to get back at me
because I never tipped you

35:51.627 --> 35:53.542
for bussing my trays?

35:53.586 --> 35:55.153
- At least
you're consistent, Chip.

35:55.196 --> 35:58.199
Once an ass, always an ass.
- Said the bottom to the top.

- Excuse me?

35:59.635 --> 36:03.596

touching their food,

36:06.294 --> 36:08.209
