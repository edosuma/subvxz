00:34.701 --> 00:38.330
<i>Once upon a time,
on a beautiful country day,</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:42.251
<i>the birds weren't singing,
the fish weren't jumping,</i>

00:42.334 --> 00:45.420
<i>and there was not
a hopping rabbit to be found,</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:50.717
<i>for everyone was gathered
to celebrate two very special people</i>

00:50.801 --> 00:55.097
<i>at what can only be described
as a storybook wedding.</i>

01:09.194 --> 01:11.822
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.283
Well, that was dumb.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.704
Hello.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.630
Hi.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.299
Hello.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.677
Welcome, friends.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.890
We are gathered here today
to join Bea and Thomas in holy matrimony.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.017
You're taking this so well.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.060
He's a good man. Makes her happy.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.898
And also a special day
for their family, the beloved rabbits.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.025
Your former enemy is here to stay.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.526
We found common ground.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.403
He's about to be our guardian.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.572
Nah, this is just a little something
between them.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.034
The old you would have gone
bonkers-berserk by now.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.870
- I've changed, cousin.
- ...welcoming a new parent.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.123
A loaded hand grenade,
just waiting to explode.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.501
- Not anymore.
- A father, if you will.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.252
Father?

02:07.336 --> 02:08.294
Father.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.298
You're not my father!

02:45.290 --> 02:48.085
You'll never be my father!

02:48.168 --> 02:50.712
And everyone can see your underpants!

02:51.672 --> 02:53.841
Peter. Peter.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.217
Peter.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.928
- Peter, the ring.
- Wha...?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.890
Right, right.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.142
Where'd I put...? Did I...?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.978
Was it...? No, was it...?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.814
Hang on. I had it in the...

03:14.152 --> 03:16.029
It's always in the last place you look.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.948
You only have two pockets.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.034
You may now kiss the groom.

03:29.084 --> 03:29.918
What?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.095
Bye!

03:41.138 --> 03:42.181
Bye!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.473
- Bye.
- We'll miss you.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.104
<i>So Bea and Mr. McGregor were married,</i>

03:49.188 --> 03:51.231
<i>and off they went on their honeymoon.</i>

03:51.315 --> 03:54.526
<i>Things couldn't have been
more peaceful in Windermere</i>

03:54.610 --> 03:57.863
<i>until, sometime later...</i>

03:59.031 --> 04:01.450
You just take this out.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.492
You see?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.578
Now you try.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.457
Dad, it's Peter Rabbit from the book.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.544
I hate that I'm the face of this.

04:12.628 --> 04:16.005
But every story can only have
one good guy, so...

04:16.089 --> 04:17.591
Peter doesn't have a dad.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.010
He got put in a pie.
That's why he's so naughty.

04:20.093 --> 04:20.928
What?

04:21.011 --> 04:23.222
There's Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-Tail.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.474
- I'm Flopsy.
- And I'm Mopsy.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.809
And I'm the hero. But I'm not naughty.

04:27.893 --> 04:31.271
- Did this kid even read the book?
- Did you read the book?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.774
I am so busy.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.359
I'm saving it for summer.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.568
Are you the author?

04:36.652 --> 04:39.029
I'm still getting used
to people calling me that.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.533
It's really the rabbits' story.
I just wrote it down.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.035
This is my husband. He's our publisher.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.537
I wouldn't say "publisher."

04:46.620 --> 04:47.955
I just...

04:48.038 --> 04:49.748
I just do the typesetting,

04:49.831 --> 04:51.834
turned our dining room
into a printing workshop,

04:51.917 --> 04:55.212
created the artisanal lithography with
a five-colour palette for the illustrations,

04:55.295 --> 04:56.755
apart from the ones of the garden,

04:56.839 --> 05:00.384
- which call for more green. I like...
- Don't reveal all your secrets, darling.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.470
It's wonderful.
You paint the rabbits with such love.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.557
Well, it comes naturally. It's our family.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.268
Thanks for your contribution.
It goes directly to preserving their land.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.227
Thank you.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.187
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.983
Afternoon! Congratulations, you two.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.110
- Thanks, Moira.
- Oh, the mail.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.778
Choose to see who gets it.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.990
Chest. Toe. Chest.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.033
Ears. Tail.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.493
Yes!

05:26.577 --> 05:28.620
How does he always win?

05:28.704 --> 05:30.581
Because he invented the game.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.461
- Peter? Is that you?
- Johnny?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.130
What are you doing out of London?

05:38.213 --> 05:41.175
We're just up here doing
some cheese tasting.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.386
- Heard about the wedding. Any babies yet?
- It's only been a month.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.556
The wife and I have had 15 kids
in that time.

05:47.639 --> 05:51.768
This is the first day away from them,
and, oh, the peace and quiet.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.563
I'd be lying to you
if I said we didn't miss them terribly

05:54.646 --> 05:56.064
and they're all we talk about.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.108
Aw, cute.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.444
But there's no babies. We're their family.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.529
Until you're not.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.074
Congratulations on the book, by the way.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.951
My kids absolutely loved it.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.661
Oh, it's not about me.

06:09.745 --> 06:14.374
It's just great that kids get to read
about positive role models like me.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.377
Peter!

06:19.087 --> 06:20.464
Oh, dear. My cheese.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.174
Well, good luck.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.968
I'm sure it was just an accident.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.720
It's not an accident.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.555
It's what he does.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.848
He never behaves.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.892
He loves you. Don't listen to him.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.353
He doesn't listen to me. That's the problem.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.687
Not in front of him, okay?

06:35.771 --> 06:38.315
He can't understand me. Can he?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.900
No, but still, just...

06:39.983 --> 06:41.568
So, if he can't understand me,

06:41.652 --> 06:44.863
then why can't I say whatever it is
that I want to say?

06:46.114 --> 06:49.368
Say something nice. Apologise.
Say something nice to him. Now! Go! Say it!

06:49.451 --> 06:51.328
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Out loud!

06:51.411 --> 06:55.582
I'm sorry, Peter. I love you,
in the way that an adult human loves a...

06:55.666 --> 06:58.919
- An animal rabbit.
- Thank you.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.842
You handled that very well, Peter.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.804
Contrite, apologetic
and even a little bit remorseful.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.097
I'm sorry. What?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.600
I put these in
for when I'm feeling misunderstood.

07:13.684 --> 07:17.563
Oh, come on, Peter.
Sometimes you have to face the music.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.107
And these are
for when I'm feeling ganged up on.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.526
You always take things one step too far.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.362
I'm sorry. What?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.822
What's this?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.323
Basil-Jones Publishing.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.784
We carried a whole section
of their books at Harrods.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.537
It was the last display I arranged
before I resigned.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.164
You mean, fired and physically removed
from the store.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.749
"Potayto," "potahto."

07:37.833 --> 07:40.878
It's from Nigel Basil-Jones himself.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.589
He wants to publish my book.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.923
No.

07:45.007 --> 07:48.135
Get it in every bookstore, promote it,
put it in different languages.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.178
That's incredible.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.848
Bea, you've done it.
This is it. It's happening!

07:53.891 --> 07:58.437
Promise me something. When this book is
a huge success, you'll keep me humble.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.564
The book is about all of us.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.983
Thank you. You're already doing it.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.359
Dink!

08:10.073 --> 08:12.951
Why do you always copy everything I do?

08:13.035 --> 08:15.871
Fine. I'll do something different.

08:15.954 --> 08:16.955
Sorry.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.208
- Anyone hungry?
- Yeah, starving.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.293
Leave it with me.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.595
Okay, take one bite and pass it around.

08:31.678 --> 08:36.099
I'm just going to wait until we get home,
where the food isn't decomposing.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.602
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me too.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.687
Well, la-di-da.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.441
I didn't realise I was
with a bunch of sophisticates.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.541
- Let's go get some dinner.
- Yeah!

09:04.920 --> 09:06.171
And there they go.

09:06.255 --> 09:09.424
Right through the opening
where there once was a gate.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.634
Good for them.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.178
Do they do any of the planting
and weeding and watering?

09:13.262 --> 09:16.682
- No, they don't. But they were here first.
- Exactly.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.393
And you still have your tomatoes.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.520
My tomatoes.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.691
I would never have thought
a city man would like to garden that much.

09:25.774 --> 09:29.319
I even heard he wants to try
and sell them at market.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.574
It's too moist. I'll get the hair dryer.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.742
It's about time he had a hobby.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.662
I hope he's as successful at his
as I am at mine.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.038
And what is that?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.832
Passing judgement.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.794
What is going on with her hair?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.757
Wait! You don't have to try
to eat me anymore.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.177
Remember? You're welcome to all of this.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.512
Right, right, right.
Still getting used to that.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.972
I have so much energy.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.559
I think it's this new plant-based diet
and that I don't have to chase you anymore.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.227
I'm just like...

10:03.228 --> 10:04.813
Have you tried jogging?

10:04.897 --> 10:06.106
What's jogging?

10:06.190 --> 10:09.943
It's running without a terrified animal
in front of you.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.030
- Think that'll work?
- I'm desperately hoping so.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.660
There you go, sweeties.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.580
Hey.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.834
I can't believe
this might turn into something.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.676
I'll get it!

10:35.677 --> 10:37.596
It might be the publisher!

10:37.679 --> 10:40.557
Peter, you know not to touch this stuff.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.936
Honestly, my kids will be
so much better behaved.

10:44.937 --> 10:45.771
Hello?

10:50.025 --> 10:51.652
Miss you, Dad.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.321
No one gets me the way you did.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.074
Bea, Bea, it is. It's the publisher.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.245
Hello.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.122
Yes, this is she.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.169
No! Tommy!

11:09.253 --> 11:11.338
Those are Mr. McGregor's.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.216
But you used to steal from him all the time.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.926
We share the garden now.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.555
Oh, because he married the lady,
you do what he says now?

11:19.638 --> 11:21.348
No, not because of that.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.058
Well, kind of because of that. It's...

11:23.141 --> 11:25.811
Look, just don't touch the tomatoes, badger.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.146
Oh, okay.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.492
And?

11:43.287 --> 11:44.997
I swear, if it wasn't for me...

11:45.080 --> 11:48.709
Thank you. Oh, you're very...
You're very kind.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.254
The 11:15 train to Gloucester?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.882
Yeah, we should be able to make that.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.468
I knew it! I saw you!

11:59.469 --> 12:01.972
Get out! Get out of my garden!

12:02.055 --> 12:04.975
Oh, the rabbits would love to come.
It'd be such a fun adventure.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.643
I knew you wouldn't change.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.645
- You're the same naughty rabbit...
- Thanks. Bye.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.855
...you've always been!

12:09.938 --> 12:14.276
Just leave my tomatoes alone!
You have everything else!

12:17.738 --> 12:20.115
See? I've told him a million times.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.659
- He doesn't listen to me.
- Go easy on him.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.120
He's getting used to the idea
that you're here to stay.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.844
Yeah. You can use your front legs too.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.430
Oh, right, right, right.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.903
- Is this all for us?
- That's what the ticket said.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.489
Only the best for the next big thing.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.991
What do we have here?

13:14.878 --> 13:17.256
"Enjoy the journey.
It's just the beginning."

13:17.339 --> 13:19.800
A bit presumptuous, isn't it?

13:20.843 --> 13:23.679
"Forgive me for being presumptuous."

13:23.762 --> 13:24.596
He's good.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.767
As someone who's been on a train before,
a few pointers.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.644
Don't stare at the scenery rushing by.

13:30.727 --> 13:35.107
Look at a fixed point on the horizon
and just lock your eyes onto that.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.113
You okay?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.449
When you're on a train,
the best thing is to look

13:44.533 --> 13:47.911
at a fixed point on the horizon.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.002
Oh, no.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.088
Magic, magic, magic.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.548
Magic!

13:59.631 --> 14:02.968
Oh, no. Cotton-Tail just discovered sugar.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.388
Hey, we had a good run.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.807
"Lavatory."

14:19.151 --> 14:22.446
I'm gonna live forever!

14:26.408 --> 14:28.452
Told you!

14:39.880 --> 14:41.715
Thank you.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.513
Do you know what happens
after you eat too much sugar?

14:48.555 --> 14:49.389
That.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.683
Come on, sweeties.

14:55.771 --> 14:56.688
Please come in.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.901
There they are.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.110
- Hello.
- Bea.

15:02.194 --> 15:05.739
You're even lovelier than I imagined.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.865
- Thomas.
- Hello.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.450
- Handsome devil.
- Well...

15:08.534 --> 15:10.702
I'm sure I'm one of many
beating down your door,

15:10.786 --> 15:14.248
- begging to publish your next book.
- Yes, well, so many.

15:14.331 --> 15:18.710
In fact, we don't have a door anymore.
It's been beaten right off its hinges.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.590
And the stars themselves,
with Peter, the ringleader.

15:23.674 --> 15:24.716
Always out front.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.968
Sweet.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.804
I'm not your leader.
I'm not always out front.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.056
Look, you come here.
Benjamin, swing out a little.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.059
Mops, back it up to your right.
Flopsy, you come this way.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.187
Benjamin, Mops, split the difference.
There you go. You'll slot here.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.481
I'll go here, and...

15:40.899 --> 15:45.153
If you'll allow me to gush,
the book is absolutely exquisite.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.822
A triumph.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.574
I'll allow you.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.244
"What greater gift
than the love of a rabbit."

15:54.997 --> 15:56.623
- Charles Dickens.
- Yes.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.209
Well, he said "a cat."
You obviously knew that.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.669
Of course. I love Dickens.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.963
- Know every word he's written.
- You do?

16:03.046 --> 16:04.047
- No, you don't.
- I do.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.799
I don't think so.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.634
Strong.

16:07.718 --> 16:08.552
- Yeah.
- You box?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.554
Yeah, no, I... Yeah, I do. I do box.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.847
- You do?
- Yep.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.098
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

16:13.182 --> 16:15.267
- When?
- I flop the heavy ropes.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.729
I move the heavy metal bars.
I've got those big balls of sand.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.815
I do push-ups outside in the thing
with my shirt off.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.443
And I also like protein ointments.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.529
- Well, we should get in the ring sometime.
- Yeah. That's not a problem.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.114
- Now, I'd like to walk you...
- Sorry.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.490
...through our strategy.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.243
Carlos, some water for our rabbits.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.829
Bea, sit right here.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.040
Sparkling and still.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.003
- Thomas, right here.
- Fancy.

16:45.923 --> 16:47.799
It's like drinking sand.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.010
I like it. It's delicious.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.596
- You're just saying that to be different.
- Am not.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.056
Drink some more, then.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.397
It's amazing.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.320
So we want to start by printing 5000 copies

17:09.404 --> 17:12.156
of your book.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.493
- Five thousand?
- I assume you want to write a second one?

17:15.577 --> 17:18.247
I hadn't really thought about it, but...

17:19.289 --> 17:21.458
I don't know, I guess
I do have a brief framework

17:21.541 --> 17:23.292
for a 23-book series

17:23.377 --> 17:26.672
featuring 109 characters
based on the animals in my life,

17:26.755 --> 17:29.633
creating an interwoven narrative
about morality, nature and family,

17:29.716 --> 17:32.261
set in the fields and towns around our farm.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.887
Fantastic.

17:33.971 --> 17:37.349
Fantastic. Fantastic.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.644
Because it's in your next book
that we see huge potential.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.479
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.189
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

17:44.273 --> 17:45.399
I don't trust this guy.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.735
We've done some research on your book.

17:48.819 --> 17:52.155
Now, people liked the story and the setting,

17:52.239 --> 17:55.868
but what they really loved were the rabbits.

17:55.951 --> 17:59.037
So, in the second book,
we want to emphasise their individuality.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.958
"Benjamin, the wise one."

18:03.041 --> 18:05.002
"Cotton-Tail, the firecracker."

18:05.085 --> 18:06.545
This guy is good.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.089
"Flopsy and Mopsy, the dynamic duo."

18:09.173 --> 18:11.592
- Why are we always treated...?
- As a unit?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.427
- But we do...
- Look good.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.721
- And then, finally, Peter.
- What?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.223
I get one? This is crazy.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.892
We have two options for him.

18:19.975 --> 18:22.728
I get two?

18:22.811 --> 18:24.855
"The mischief maker." Or...

18:26.773 --> 18:28.650
"The bad seed."

18:28.734 --> 18:31.153
Nope. And he was doing so well too.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.071
That one. That's the one. You've nailed it.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.698
- What?
- It's our favourite too.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.742
- Really speaks to his character.
- No, it doesn't.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.536
"The bad seed" seems harsh, don't you think?

18:39.620 --> 18:41.580
Well, he is a bit of a brat, really.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.373
Even according to your own book,

18:43.457 --> 18:45.792
he nearly broke you two up
and destroyed his own family.

18:45.876 --> 18:48.504
He's a little mischievous,
but he doesn't mean anything by it.

18:48.587 --> 18:51.131
- Exactly. Thank you.
- I did catch him yesterday

18:51.215 --> 18:52.674
trying to steal one of my tomatoes.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.677
No, no, no. I was actually making sure
that no one stole your tomatoes.

18:55.761 --> 18:59.681
- I also imagine his voice to be annoying.
- What?!

18:59.765 --> 19:03.352
My voice isn't annoying, right?

19:04.394 --> 19:06.313
I have something to show you.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.859
Here's how much we want to do this with you.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.738
Oh, my goodness.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.824
My ears are gigantic.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.993
Peter really looks like a villain.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.829
- Every story needs one.
- I'm not a villain.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.207
That's not an accurate reflection
of any of us.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.251
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.002
- I love it.
- What?

19:29.086 --> 19:31.755
I think it's terrific.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.799
Oh, it's incredible.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.510
It must be so precious
to see your family up there.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.846
It's my dream come true.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.768
They look amazing!

20:01.952 --> 20:04.246
Oh, come on.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.721
<i>I walk alone, I walk alone</i>

20:20.804 --> 20:22.472
Of course you'd be singing that song.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.975
I can sing something else if you like.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.351
Suit yourself.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.896
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>

20:28.979 --> 20:32.274
<i>Someone out there will find me</i>

20:32.357 --> 20:37.738
<i>Till then I walk alone</i>

20:48.415 --> 20:50.167
What you looking at, son?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.669
Never seen anyone steal something before?

20:52.753 --> 20:54.713
You some kind of goody-goody?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.423
I'm no goody-goody.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.550
In fact, apparently, I'm bad.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.302
Yeah, I've made some mistakes,

21:00.385 --> 21:02.721
which is what I thought
kids are supposed to do, right?

21:02.804 --> 21:04.598
Learn, grow, evolve.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.809
But I guess, for this rabbit,
the die is cast.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.103
And you know what? I don't care anymore.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.897
Oh, good for you, son.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.149
But if I can just suggest one thing,

21:14.233 --> 21:16.693
next time you meet
a grizzled old thief on the street,

21:16.777 --> 21:18.862
maybe don't open up so much.

21:18.946 --> 21:21.532
- Sorry.
- No, I like it.

21:21.615 --> 21:25.369
It's just, out here, not everyone's
as emotionally evolved as I am.

21:26.495 --> 21:28.747
Name's Barnabas. Nice to meet you.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.749
- Peter.
- Take a peach.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.462
You said you weren't a goody-goody.

21:35.546 --> 21:38.006
No. I'm no goody-goody.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.133
I'm a baddy-baddy.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.139
Oh, no.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.267
- Come on.
- I've had it with you rats!

21:48.350 --> 21:50.978
- I hate when they call us rodents.
- Come back here!

21:51.061 --> 21:53.021
Also when they try and hit us with a broom.

21:53.105 --> 21:56.942
- That is not what a broom is for!
- Get out of my shop!

21:58.569 --> 22:01.113
Oh, I've had it with you rats!

22:01.196 --> 22:02.865
You owe me a peach, son.

22:02.948 --> 22:04.950
Lucky I had this safe house nearby.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.828
- Where you from?
- None of your business, old man.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.705
What?

22:09.788 --> 22:11.832
Well, you told me not to open up.

22:11.915 --> 22:16.545
Now you're learning,
but, also, I am genuinely curious.

22:16.628 --> 22:19.673
I'm from the country,
on a farm, near a pond.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.509
Really? Where'd you get that jacket?

22:22.593 --> 22:24.887
It looks just like one
my old friend used to have.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.847
It was my dad's.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.227
We got to go.

22:39.693 --> 22:40.736
You okay, son?

22:40.819 --> 22:42.029
Yeah. I'm fine.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.324
Did you just wink at me?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.283
Sorry.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.077
No, no, the only other rabbit I knew
who could wink

22:49.161 --> 22:52.831
was my friend from the country,
and he lived next to a pond.

22:52.915 --> 22:56.627
Wait a minute. That farmer,
his name isn't McGregor, is it?

22:56.710 --> 23:00.172
- Yeah.
- Are you Peter Rabbit?

23:00.255 --> 23:02.883
- Yeah.
- I can't believe it.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.636
My old friend, I think he was your dad.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.680
They're in the recycling bin!

23:08.764 --> 23:11.767
- What do we do?
- We have some fun.

23:13.685 --> 23:14.686
There you are!

23:16.313 --> 23:17.314
How is this fun?

23:17.397 --> 23:20.025
Because they actually believe
they have a chance.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.860
Okay.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.040
Should this be in paper or plastic?

23:35.123 --> 23:37.376
No one really knows.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.473
Got you!

23:54.351 --> 23:55.644
What do we do now?

24:09.867 --> 24:12.286
- You're right! That was fun.
- Yeah.

24:12.369 --> 24:15.873
And there's a lot more of that
around every corner.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.292
We've got you!

24:20.669 --> 24:21.545
Now, come on.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.714
Get in there, rabbit.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.890
Who are these people?
Where are they taking us?

24:32.973 --> 24:34.558
Stay calm, son.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.352
I won't let anything happen to you.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.063
And here.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.357
And there.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.442
Here.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.403
And that's a fingerprint.

24:48.197 --> 24:50.032
I just need to say something.

24:50.115 --> 24:53.702
My book is very personal to me,
and I don't want it to be compromised.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.079
I'd be spinning in my grave
if it was ever adapted

24:56.163 --> 25:01.043
into some sassy hip-fest,
purely for commercial gain,

25:01.126 --> 25:02.628
probably by an American.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.758
I give you my word that I will be
your ferocious guardian,

25:07.841 --> 25:09.718
a fortress between your art

25:09.801 --> 25:12.679
and all who wish
to boorishly capitalize on it.

25:14.473 --> 25:15.516
Let's do it.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.897
I'm telling you, this guy's garbage.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.274
Of course, making it more contemporary

25:24.358 --> 25:27.653
would increase the readership
and benefit your land preservation fund

25:27.736 --> 25:30.239
by, say, putting the rabbits
in high-tops and T-shirts?

25:34.368 --> 25:36.411
But you're a purist.

25:36.495 --> 25:37.412
I respect that.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.790
Sir, Marvin Stuart's outside for you.

25:39.873 --> 25:41.583
Ah, Marvin.

25:41.667 --> 25:42.918
One of our authors.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.503
Marvin Stuart.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.214
Hi, Marvin. I'll be right down.

25:47.297 --> 25:50.551
We bought him that car
when his book hit number one.

25:50.634 --> 25:53.637
Marvin made a picture book
about butterflies.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.514
Gorgeous, elegant.

25:55.597 --> 25:59.101
You could hang it in a museum.
Sold 250 copies.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.811
I made a small suggestion.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.648
Sold 15 million copies.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.568
That's more than Dickens.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.363
- Where's Peter?
- Yeah, I'm starting to get worried.

26:11.446 --> 26:12.447
This is not like him.

26:12.531 --> 26:15.576
The last time I saw him,
we were staring at the billboard.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.495
Ah, the billboard.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.248
But seriously, where is Peter?

26:28.422 --> 26:30.382
You got two this time. Nice one.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.514
Well, I don't know why I'm here.

26:37.598 --> 26:38.974
I want that one.

26:39.057 --> 26:42.477
He's just like Peter
from that book Nana gave me.

26:50.569 --> 26:54.072
They want to go together.
Can I get this one too, Mum, please?

26:54.156 --> 26:55.699
They look like father and son.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.659
More like "before" and "after."

26:57.743 --> 26:59.119
They're so filthy.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.498
All right, then. Go on.

27:04.583 --> 27:09.588
Honestly, I don't know how you like
those things. They're just vermin.

27:14.468 --> 27:16.637
Liam, we've got two rabbits!

27:18.263 --> 27:22.226
This next part might get a little bumpy,
but it's actually quite fun.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.853
Don't touch them
until they've had their shots!

27:24.937 --> 27:27.231
They probably have the plague.

27:29.358 --> 27:32.194
I'm naming mine Monkey Boo-Boo Face.

27:32.277 --> 27:35.280
Mine's Mrs. Cottage Cheese.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.289
Aren't you a good rabbit?

27:50.462 --> 27:52.548
Hello. Hello. Hello.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.387
This is so humiliating.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.764
Here, try this.

28:00.848 --> 28:02.808
Much better. Thanks.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.985
Let's go, kids! We're off to Grandma.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.531
Won't they feel scared in the dark, Mum?

28:17.614 --> 28:19.867
They're animals. They don't have feelings.

28:20.951 --> 28:23.078
This is what it's like to be a pet?

28:23.161 --> 28:28.417
The kids mean well,
but that mum's a real monster.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.129
What do we do now?

28:32.212 --> 28:33.797
We go to work.

29:18.342 --> 29:19.301
Jackpot.

29:25.182 --> 29:27.518
Get a bag, son.
They're always under the sink.

29:37.277 --> 29:40.239
I'll just go ahead and use the handle.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.326
Putting tomatoes in the fridge.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.953
And they call us animals.

29:48.455 --> 29:49.414
I get it.

29:49.498 --> 29:51.458
You wanted to get caught.

29:51.542 --> 29:55.504
You wanted to get taken to the pet shop.

29:55.587 --> 29:59.424
You wanted to get adopted
so you could take their food.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.011
This is the McGregor's garden of the city.

30:03.095 --> 30:04.930
It's how we survive out here.

30:05.013 --> 30:07.474
Really? Are they all like this?

30:07.558 --> 30:09.893
Nah. It's usually just takeout containers

30:09.977 --> 30:14.565
and a bottle of champagne they're saving
for a special occasion that will never come.

30:14.648 --> 30:16.233
Oh, that's so sad.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.402
Yeah, it's really sad.

30:22.072 --> 30:25.200
Anyway, let's steal some more stuff, yeah?

30:52.394 --> 30:53.854
Wait, we're stealing from kids?

30:53.937 --> 30:55.689
Only the stuff they'll never eat.

30:55.772 --> 30:57.482
Why do parents put it in there?

30:57.566 --> 30:59.276
So teachers won't judge them.

31:07.492 --> 31:08.911
Mighty nice haul, son.

31:08.994 --> 31:10.329
How do we get it out of here?

31:10.412 --> 31:13.874
Job's worth nothing
without a good pickup crew.

31:15.792 --> 31:20.297
Meet the crew.
Samuel Whiskers, oldest thief in the city.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.090
They ain't even his whiskers.

31:22.174 --> 31:23.383
He stole them.

31:24.426 --> 31:25.511
Tom Kitten.

31:25.594 --> 31:29.223
He don't say much, but when he does,
you're glad he don't say much.

31:29.306 --> 31:32.559
Can we come in now?
I'm freezing my catnip off.

31:32.643 --> 31:35.604
And his sister, Mittens. The brains.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.272
Always keeps us on track.

31:37.356 --> 31:40.234
Enough with the introductions.
Let's get on with it.

31:40.317 --> 31:42.986
- Storage room?
- Second door to the right.

31:43.070 --> 31:45.155
- Coatroom?
- Third door to the left.

31:45.239 --> 31:48.575
- Bathroom?
- I told you to go before you came.

31:48.659 --> 31:51.328
- End of the hall.
- Thank you.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.789
So how do we get this stuff out of here?

31:57.459 --> 31:58.836
Is this really gonna work?

31:58.919 --> 32:02.422
A well-dressed man can get away
with anything in this world.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.759
And if he's got a baby with him,
he can go anywhere.

32:05.843 --> 32:06.969
Three weeks ago,

32:07.052 --> 32:09.638
we rang the opening bell
at the stock exchange.

32:12.099 --> 32:13.934
Why did you want to do that?

32:14.017 --> 32:15.811
Because we could.

32:19.523 --> 32:20.440
Okay.

32:22.776 --> 32:24.653
Howard, where have you been?

32:24.736 --> 32:27.155
I need you to help me get rid
of those filthy rabbits

32:27.239 --> 32:29.449
before the children come home.

32:29.533 --> 32:31.451
Have you gotten even shorter?

32:35.372 --> 32:36.999
You little beasts!

32:38.208 --> 32:39.918
- Come on.
- Wait, what about all the food?

32:40.002 --> 32:44.089
- We're just gonna leave it?
- Better to live to see another day, kid.

32:44.173 --> 32:46.466
I'm going to exterminate you little demons.

32:46.550 --> 32:47.551
- See you.
- Laters.

32:47.634 --> 32:52.181
No, wait. I know how to deal
with cranky humans who hate our guts.

32:52.264 --> 32:54.558
You lead her to the kitchen.
I'll take care of her.

32:54.641 --> 32:56.727
You meet me back at the front door.

32:58.520 --> 33:03.567
You can't hide from me,
you disgusting bags of disease.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.410
I'm gonna get you!

33:44.274 --> 33:45.567
Run!

33:48.195 --> 33:50.030
Hey!

33:51.281 --> 33:53.450
Get back here!

33:57.287 --> 33:59.414
I can't believe this is happening!

34:15.973 --> 34:18.266
Need that altered, madam?

34:21.562 --> 34:25.023
You were amazing, kid.
How'd you know how to do all that?

34:25.107 --> 34:26.065
It's a gift.

34:26.149 --> 34:29.319
Terrible at foreign languages,
great at cartoon violence.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.822
Well, you did good, amigo.

34:31.905 --> 34:34.658
- Sorry, I did good, a-what now?
- This is the best take we've had

34:34.741 --> 34:35.742
in a long time.

34:35.826 --> 34:37.578
And we got Peter to thank for it.

34:37.661 --> 34:41.540
He's the kid, the kid!
Who's the kid? He's the kid.

34:41.623 --> 34:44.126
Come here, you. Come here, you!

34:44.208 --> 34:46.335
Hello. Knock, knock. Ding-dong.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.797
Word on the street is,
you had a nice little pickup.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.050
- Get lost, Robinson.
- Okeydokey. Will do.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.594
Hope I don't blab to anyone
about this though.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.097
You know how I love to blab.

34:58.265 --> 35:00.267
Take care of him, son.

35:00.350 --> 35:03.854
Sure. What can I get you?
We have cheese, apples, champagne.

35:03.937 --> 35:06.106
- "Congratulating..."
- No.

35:06.190 --> 35:07.816
Take care of him.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.067
What?

35:09.151 --> 35:10.777
No, I was kidding, Barnabas.

35:10.861 --> 35:12.613
I won't tell on you. I promise!

35:12.696 --> 35:14.114
You got to make it tight.

35:14.198 --> 35:15.991
The rabbit comes out of the hole,

35:16.074 --> 35:19.536
- round the tree, back down the hole.
- What are you doing? No, no.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.662
No.

35:21.997 --> 35:24.499
- Hang on. That hurt, mate.
- Okay, son.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.877
- Now take care of him.
- No, no, no.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.253
- Please stop.
- No, I don't...

35:28.337 --> 35:31.715
- He won't say anything. Right?
- No, no, I won't say nothing.

35:31.798 --> 35:34.801
I mean, I still feel bad
about what I did to that mom.

35:34.885 --> 35:37.012
Freezer door, champagne, hair dryer.

35:37.095 --> 35:40.641
- I thought that was a bit cruel.
- Are you part of the gang or not?

35:40.724 --> 35:44.061
Well, yeah, I'd like to be,
but I don't do this.

35:44.144 --> 35:47.022
- Can't we just talk it out?
- Please, please!

35:47.105 --> 35:48.440
No, no! Please!

35:48.524 --> 35:50.108
We're kidding!

35:51.151 --> 35:55.614
We were all just playing with you.
You should've seen your face, son.

35:55.697 --> 35:58.367
No, I was kidding you, so...

35:58.450 --> 36:00.118
You're the ones who should be wondering

36:00.202 --> 36:02.162
whether there's a private space
that you can go to,

36:02.246 --> 36:04.122
to check whether you've wet yourselves.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.960
We share with our friends.

36:08.043 --> 36:10.254
Besides, it's gonna go bad
before we can eat it all.

36:11.380 --> 36:13.006
Pigs can fly!

36:13.090 --> 36:14.967
Come on. Let's get some air.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.556
Oh, they were special times.

36:20.639 --> 36:23.851
Food enough for everyone, wide open spaces.

36:23.934 --> 36:26.562
Until old McGregor came
and put that wall up.

36:26.645 --> 36:30.190
We all thought it was the end for us.
But not your dad.

36:30.274 --> 36:31.817
Now, the question is:

36:31.900 --> 36:35.654
Was he stealing, or was he just taking
what was already his?

36:35.737 --> 36:37.406
Exactly. We were there first.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.700
- It belonged...
- He was stealing.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.536
But he was keeping your bellies full
the only way he could.

36:42.619 --> 36:45.205
And he taught me everything I know.

36:45.289 --> 36:46.957
Fancy a treat?

36:49.042 --> 36:49.918
Wait here.

36:57.593 --> 36:59.344
Coming at you!

36:59.428 --> 37:01.013
Here you go, son.

37:01.096 --> 37:03.807
Wow, that's so good. What is this?

37:03.891 --> 37:05.392
It's a potato.

37:05.475 --> 37:08.979
What?!

37:09.062 --> 37:11.190
Let me ask you a question.
Is my voice annoying?

37:11.273 --> 37:14.693
Yeah, it's a bit polarising, but I like it.

37:14.776 --> 37:17.321
I love this place.
No one telling me I'm bad.

37:17.404 --> 37:19.448
I really feel like I belong.

37:19.531 --> 37:21.491
I wish I had 10 more just like you.

37:21.575 --> 37:24.536
Then I could pull off the job
me and your dad used to dream about.

37:24.620 --> 37:27.414
- One that could feed us forever.
- Peter!

37:27.497 --> 37:28.415
Peter?

37:28.498 --> 37:30.125
- Come on.
- Peter!

37:30.209 --> 37:33.045
Peter! There you are.

37:33.128 --> 37:36.089
Oh, Peter. We've been looking
all over for you.

37:36.173 --> 37:38.425
Oh, thank goodness. Are you okay?

37:38.509 --> 37:40.761
He's fine. We have to hurry
to catch the last train.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.638
Okay.

37:48.810 --> 37:50.854
Peter, what happened to you?

37:50.938 --> 37:53.065
We were starting to get worried.

37:53.148 --> 37:55.567
I just went for a walk. Come on, let's go.

37:56.610 --> 37:57.945
Is he all right?

37:58.028 --> 37:59.905
Seems to be.

38:14.127 --> 38:16.046
Yes! Yes.

38:16.129 --> 38:17.673
What are you doing?

38:17.756 --> 38:19.258
Doing some push-ups.

38:19.341 --> 38:22.803
Oh, you just suddenly had the urge
to work out, did you?

38:22.886 --> 38:25.347
Just suddenly had the urge
to read Dickens, did you?

38:25.430 --> 38:27.015
You know he's my favourite author.

38:27.099 --> 38:28.725
Name another book by Dickens.

38:29.852 --> 38:31.270
Do another push-up.

38:33.021 --> 38:34.606
Okay.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.448
Oh, I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

38:46.201 --> 38:48.203
Cock-a-doodle-do!

38:48.287 --> 38:51.498
Wake up, kids! Wake up! We have a job to do!

38:51.582 --> 38:52.583
- What?
- Dad.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.168
- Come on.
- We're tired.

38:54.251 --> 38:58.213
But we have to make
the gigantic ball of fire rise into the sky

38:58.297 --> 39:00.007
so the earth gets warm

39:00.090 --> 39:02.551
and life as we know it can continue!

39:02.634 --> 39:03.468
What?

39:03.552 --> 39:05.554
- For real?
- That's a lot of responsibility.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.890
Cock-a-doodle-do!

39:07.973 --> 39:09.850
Cock-a-doodle-do.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.186
Now, feel free to peck around,

39:12.269 --> 39:16.648
doing absolutely nothing
for the next 24 hours.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.447
Ready to tell me
where you went off to yesterday?

39:23.530 --> 39:26.533
- You had us all worried.
- No need to worry, cousin.

39:26.617 --> 39:30.120
I was meeting someone
who may have changed my life.

39:33.624 --> 39:36.210
You met a girl! Yes! Tell me everything.

39:36.293 --> 39:38.712
What's her name? Mary? Scarlett? Josephine?

39:38.795 --> 39:40.464
- Barnabas.
- Terrific.

39:40.547 --> 39:43.383
- No, he's an old friend of Dad's.
- Wonderful.

39:43.467 --> 39:45.177
No! He's a thief.

39:46.553 --> 39:50.140
Peter, you do not have my blessing
to kiss a thief.

39:50.224 --> 39:52.935
Would you just let me tell you my story?

39:53.018 --> 39:56.605
- Race you, Flopsy.
- I am not Flopsy anymore.

39:56.688 --> 40:00.400
I've changed my name
to be even different-er than you.

40:00.484 --> 40:03.487
From now on, I'm Lavatory.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.489
- Lavatory?
- Yes.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.574
And I run on two legs now.

40:08.575 --> 40:10.452
It's classier.

40:11.495 --> 40:14.289
Think how much of this land
we'll be able to preserve.

40:14.373 --> 40:17.292
All the nature
our children will be able to explore.

40:17.376 --> 40:20.796
- Check it out, sisters.
- Wait for me!

40:23.298 --> 40:24.883
I never had a chance to do that.

40:24.967 --> 40:27.761
Not much frolicking in the orphanage.

40:28.804 --> 40:31.306
Which is why I also picture having
some two-legged children

40:31.390 --> 40:32.975
to frolic with.

40:33.058 --> 40:37.062
Yeah, and they'd have that whole mountain
if I painted the rabbits in high-tops.

40:37.145 --> 40:40.440
And the whole valley
if you put them in T-shirts and jeans.

40:40.524 --> 40:41.859
Yeah. Can you imagine?

40:42.901 --> 40:46.822
- What's going on with her?
- Changed her name to "Bathroom."

40:51.076 --> 40:53.745
Go on. Join them. Frolic.

40:53.829 --> 40:54.872
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:54.955 --> 40:58.834
Like, lie down horizontally,
extend my legs, tuck in my arms,

40:58.917 --> 41:01.211
and roll down the hill safely and slowly?

41:01.295 --> 41:03.297
- Yes, I could...
- Perhaps it's not for you.

41:03.380 --> 41:04.715
Let's go have a cup of tea.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.967
What do you mean, it's not for me?
It is for me.

41:07.050 --> 41:08.594
- No?
- It is most assuredly for me.

41:08.677 --> 41:10.304
I can frolic. You don't think I can?

41:10.387 --> 41:12.181
- I didn't say that.
- Madam, watch this.

41:12.264 --> 41:16.768
Imagine me, right,
and our future children frolicking.

41:16.852 --> 41:18.353
All right? Watch.

41:19.396 --> 41:22.316
Hey. See? Look, I'm frolicking.

41:26.945 --> 41:29.865
I'm speeding up a little.
I'm speeding up quite a bit.

41:32.701 --> 41:37.998
Help! Help!

41:38.081 --> 41:41.460
And that's why adults
shouldn't do kid stuff.

41:45.589 --> 41:49.885
I've been stealing from this garden
my whole life and I was told I was wrong.

41:49.968 --> 41:53.430
But now with Barnabas,
I know this is what I'm supposed to do.

41:53.514 --> 41:55.474
I'm supposed to be bad.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.726
This Barnabas sounds a bit dodgy.

41:57.809 --> 42:01.897
No, he's not dodgy.
He gets me, like Dad did.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.566
- And unlike him.
- Stay out of trouble.

42:04.650 --> 42:07.778
See? He's had it out for me
since the day he got here.

42:07.861 --> 42:10.614
He didn't say that to you.
It was to all of us.

42:10.697 --> 42:13.200
I'm talking to you, Peter, specifically.

42:13.283 --> 42:15.452
Stay out of trouble.

42:16.453 --> 42:19.998
And, anyway, our days are numbered here.
You heard him today.

42:20.082 --> 42:22.584
As soon as they have a baby, we're done for.

42:22.668 --> 42:25.879
Did you feel any less loved
when the girls were born?

42:25.963 --> 42:29.132
It's different now.
All they think I am is naughty.

42:29.216 --> 42:30.717
So I've embraced it.

42:31.802 --> 42:34.346
Look, Barnabas has a big job
that we can help with

42:34.429 --> 42:37.558
and set us up for life
without having to rely on them.

42:37.641 --> 42:38.684
I don't know.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.769
Come on, girls. We're going to Gloucester.

42:40.853 --> 42:42.771
- Okay. Why not?
- You're going to Gloucester?

42:42.855 --> 42:45.023
I'm running there tomorrow for cardio day.

42:45.107 --> 42:48.193
- Today's chest and arms.
- Come on, fox, keep going!

42:48.277 --> 42:49.653
You've got this.

42:49.736 --> 42:50.863
My trainer.

42:50.946 --> 42:53.156
Do I really need one? Probably not.

42:53.240 --> 42:56.785
Would I work out as hard without one?
Probably not.

43:18.390 --> 43:21.935
<i>I'm asking you, please, a little help</i>

43:22.936 --> 43:26.565
<i>Tell me you'll be there
When I need somebody else</i>

43:26.648 --> 43:28.817
How do you always know
what's going on with me?

43:28.901 --> 43:30.194
Just lucky, I guess.

43:30.277 --> 43:32.446
<i>I need help</i>

43:34.489 --> 43:36.366
<i>I need help</i>

43:38.035 --> 43:39.995
<i>I need help</i>

43:40.996 --> 43:42.998
I brought some more just like me.

43:43.081 --> 43:46.585
Not all just like him.
I have some reservations.

43:46.668 --> 43:48.378
<i>I need help</i>

43:48.462 --> 43:50.797
Well, look at you lot. You've gotten so big.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.258
Last time I saw you, you were all babies.

43:53.342 --> 43:56.345
Benjamin, Cotton-Tail, Flopsy, Mopsy.

43:56.428 --> 43:57.262
- Yes!
- Yes!

43:57.346 --> 44:00.599
Well, it's "Lavatory" now,
but formerly, yes.

44:00.682 --> 44:03.268
We're here to help you
on that big job you were talking about.

44:03.352 --> 44:05.521
Oh, no, no. It's much too dangerous.

44:05.604 --> 44:09.983
Okay, well, thanks for your time.
Is there a taxi stand nearby?

44:11.235 --> 44:12.402
No, trust me.

44:12.486 --> 44:15.113
We used to steal
from McGregor's garden all the time.

44:15.197 --> 44:16.573
This is much more different.

44:16.657 --> 44:18.825
I'll never forgive meself
if anything happened to you.

44:18.909 --> 44:21.286
No, we can do anything you need. Right?

44:21.370 --> 44:24.164
If you need to get to a high place,
we're your team.

44:24.248 --> 44:27.835
If you need us to be sneaky,
we can be invisible.

44:27.918 --> 44:30.003
And if you need a distraction...

44:30.087 --> 44:33.423
<i>Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow</i>

44:33.507 --> 44:36.969
<i>Back to my home, I dare not go</i>

44:37.052 --> 44:40.973
<i>For if I do, my mother will say:</i>

44:41.056 --> 44:43.433
<i>"Did you ever see a goose kissing a moose?"</i>

44:43.517 --> 44:45.018
Are these yours?

44:47.521 --> 44:49.857
<i>Down by the bay</i>

44:59.241 --> 45:00.951
And he's handy too.

45:01.034 --> 45:03.245
Is there anything this man can't do?

45:03.328 --> 45:04.496
It's just a quick fix.

45:04.580 --> 45:06.331
Thomas, can I call the glass man now?

45:06.415 --> 45:08.667
You've been at it for six hours.

45:11.086 --> 45:14.339
Bea, Nigel Basil-Jones is here.

45:14.423 --> 45:17.217
Mr. Basil-Jones, what a nice surprise.

45:17.301 --> 45:18.719
There's my star.

45:18.802 --> 45:21.763
- Is this a good time?
- "It's the best of times.

45:21.847 --> 45:23.348
It's the worst of times."

45:25.184 --> 45:26.018
Dickens.

45:28.061 --> 45:29.771
I couldn't wait to show you this.

45:30.814 --> 45:31.982
Oh, my goodness.

45:32.065 --> 45:33.400
- That's incredible.
- Beautiful.

45:33.483 --> 45:35.611
We've had a tremendous early response,

45:35.694 --> 45:39.156
and interest in your next book
is already through the roof.

45:39.239 --> 45:41.116
It's extraordinary.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.243
I have something for you too.

45:46.121 --> 45:47.539
You can barely tell the difference.

45:47.623 --> 45:49.249
- You did it.
- It's brilliant.

45:49.333 --> 45:53.420
Artistic, authentic, uncompromising.

45:53.504 --> 45:56.256
- Where is that?
- It's in our garden.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.675
- A bit limited in scope, no?
- It's where they live.

45:58.759 --> 46:00.761
I'm just thinking,
now that you've made changes,

46:00.844 --> 46:03.889
you may want to expand it a bit,
make it more fun, exotic.

46:03.972 --> 46:06.767
Maybe put them on a beach,
give them surfboards,

46:06.850 --> 46:09.895
- those little baby guitars.
- Ukuleles?

46:09.978 --> 46:11.855
Yes! Great idea. You see?

46:11.939 --> 46:16.026
You take my silly suggestions
and make them so much better. Genius!

46:16.109 --> 46:17.986
They don't play ukuleles though.

46:18.070 --> 46:21.114
And they don't go to the beach.
Right, Bea? I mean, they're rabbits.

46:21.198 --> 46:24.284
Why can't they be rabbits
on the beach? Or a boat?

46:24.368 --> 46:26.411
- Or a spaceship?
- A spaceship?

46:26.495 --> 46:30.415
Readers just want to be transported, Thomas.

46:30.499 --> 46:31.959
Dickens.

46:33.126 --> 46:35.587
Now, listen up. This is a big job.

46:35.671 --> 46:36.839
The biggest.

46:36.922 --> 46:39.049
It's the kind of job that if we pull off,

46:39.132 --> 46:42.803
we won't have to worry
about feeding ourselves ever again.

46:42.886 --> 46:45.889
But it comes with a fair bit of risk.

46:45.973 --> 46:49.893
<i>Once every so often, all the farmers
in the valley gather together.</i>

46:49.977 --> 46:52.896
- Get out of here!
- <i>They're angry, nasty.</i>

46:52.980 --> 46:56.859
<i>They want to get their food off the land
just so we can't have it.</i>

46:56.942 --> 47:00.070
<i>The sweetest corn, the crunchiest carrots,</i>

47:00.153 --> 47:01.989
<i>the ripest radishes.</i>

47:03.448 --> 47:06.535
<i>And they bring it all
to one central location,</i>

47:06.618 --> 47:08.036
<i>right here in the city,</i>

47:08.120 --> 47:10.998
<i>where they guard it from dawn till dusk.</i>

47:11.081 --> 47:13.083
And that's where we're gonna hit.

47:13.166 --> 47:14.751
Must be really hard to break in.

47:14.835 --> 47:18.630
Not a gate or a door in sight.
They wave you in with a smile.

47:18.714 --> 47:20.591
- Come on in.
- Everybody's welcome.

47:20.674 --> 47:22.593
- Won't they hear us?
- No.

47:22.676 --> 47:26.138
There's a band playing
wildly mediocre folk music.

47:28.891 --> 47:31.727
What if some kids see us?
Won't they try and adopt us again?

47:31.810 --> 47:34.563
In this place,
they just give you a little tickle.

47:34.646 --> 47:37.357
And if you want an overpriced gift
that'll never be used...

47:37.441 --> 47:40.194
<i>They sell lavender-scented bath bombs.</i>

47:40.277 --> 47:41.403
Ten pounds.

47:41.486 --> 47:43.864
What is this magical place?

47:43.947 --> 47:47.451
They call it the "farmers market."

47:48.827 --> 47:51.914
Which Whiskers has meticulously
recreated here in this map.

47:51.997 --> 47:55.501
Okay, so the thimbles are fruits.
Spindles are vegetables.

47:55.584 --> 47:58.337
The pincushion represents the sun coverage

47:58.420 --> 48:00.547
according to tomorrow's weather,
which I recorded

48:00.631 --> 48:02.257
over a series of six weekends,

48:02.341 --> 48:05.302
not including last Saturday,
which I deemed unseasonably cloudy.

48:05.385 --> 48:09.598
- Whiskers, no one cares!
- Oh, all right, fine!

48:11.016 --> 48:14.770
I hope you guys aren't visual learners.

48:14.853 --> 48:17.272
But the produce ain't what we're after.

48:17.356 --> 48:19.775
<i>Any chump with a stump can steal that.</i>

48:19.858 --> 48:22.653
What we want is far more valuable.

48:22.736 --> 48:24.780
<i>Deep in the middle of all this,</i>

48:24.863 --> 48:27.950
<i>right across from the coconut water
and two down from the wooden spoons,</i>

48:28.033 --> 48:30.202
<i>are the crown jewels.</i>

48:30.285 --> 48:33.997
<i>Our target: the dried fruit.</i>

48:34.998 --> 48:37.042
Dried fruit?

48:37.125 --> 48:39.461
- Why would you want that?
- Sounds gross.

48:41.296 --> 48:46.051
Lasts forever, and it's one-eighth
the size of a piece of fresh fruit.

48:46.134 --> 48:48.554
But with the same nutritional value.

48:48.637 --> 48:52.140
It's easy to transport
and totally untraceable.

48:52.224 --> 48:54.059
Try that.

48:55.435 --> 48:57.187
That's so good.

48:57.271 --> 48:58.605
It's no jelly bean.

48:58.689 --> 49:03.110
Hey! We don't do that stuff here.
Get me, kid? Junks up your noggin.

49:03.193 --> 49:07.030
Problem is, the dried fruit is
in the centre of the market,

49:07.114 --> 49:09.741
<i>surrounded by all the farmers.</i>

49:09.825 --> 49:13.579
<i>And the worst thing about farmers,
they stick together,</i>

49:13.662 --> 49:15.122
<i>protect each other.</i>

49:15.205 --> 49:19.251
<i>And they are an evil army
evilly unified in evil.</i>

49:19.334 --> 49:21.003
But even if we take care of them,

49:21.086 --> 49:23.380
we've got to get past
the toughest one of all.

49:23.463 --> 49:25.757
The dried fruit vendor herself,

49:25.841 --> 49:28.886
<i>Sara Nakamoto.</i>

49:28.969 --> 49:32.014
<i>Never leaves her post, no matter what.</i>

49:32.097 --> 49:35.142
But Sara Nakamoto has one Achilles' heel.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.644
<i>And it's not her actual Achilles' heel.</i>

49:37.728 --> 49:41.773
Her proverbial Achilles' heel is
the son of the cheesemonger

49:41.857 --> 49:44.484
<i>across the aisle, William Pemberly.</i>

49:44.568 --> 49:47.279
<i>He's the only one who can get her attention.</i>

49:47.362 --> 49:50.073
So if we get to him, he'll distract her,

49:50.157 --> 49:52.492
and the dried fruit will be ours.

49:52.576 --> 49:54.036
How do we get it out of there?

49:54.119 --> 49:57.289
Our old friend upstairs comes
to market every week,

49:57.372 --> 49:59.208
<i>just before it closes.</i>

49:59.291 --> 50:04.087
<i>He always buys two sausages.
One for him and one for his late wife.</i>

50:04.171 --> 50:06.215
It's a real love story, actually.

50:06.298 --> 50:08.800
They met as teenagers at a jazz hall.

50:08.884 --> 50:11.678
She was a hat-check girl.
He played the horn.

50:11.762 --> 50:13.680
- But their parents didn't approve.
- Whiskers!

50:13.764 --> 50:15.474
Whiskers, stay focused.

50:16.475 --> 50:18.727
Why doesn't anyone appreciate
a good digression?

50:18.810 --> 50:20.687
Know what they're gonna say at your funeral?

50:20.771 --> 50:23.815
"Great lady. Always stayed on topic."

50:26.026 --> 50:29.238
Anyway, we haul the loot
into the tailor's truck,

50:29.321 --> 50:32.324
<i>and he drives it
right back here for us, okay?</i>

50:33.617 --> 50:35.452
It all seems very complicated.

50:35.536 --> 50:38.914
Which is why I said
I wish I had 10 more like you.

50:38.997 --> 50:41.959
- Do you have any friends back home?
- Yes, we have lots of friends.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.252
Can they be trusted?

50:44.419 --> 50:46.171
There's a couple I wouldn't let house-sit.

50:46.255 --> 50:48.715
It doesn't matter. Bring them all.

51:17.244 --> 51:18.745
Come on, Felix, let's go.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.878
Come on, Felix, let's go.

51:29.673 --> 51:32.092
- Girls, go and get a flashlight.
- Okay.

51:43.729 --> 51:44.938
All right, everyone.

51:45.022 --> 51:47.649
I think these are finally ready to sell
at the farmers market.

51:47.733 --> 51:49.985
I want honest opinions from everyone. Right?

51:50.068 --> 51:53.530
Don't hold back.
I need to know the truth, but...

51:53.614 --> 51:54.907
only if it's good.

51:54.990 --> 51:56.575
So really sock it to me.

51:56.658 --> 51:59.745
But remember, I'm wildly insecure.

52:01.663 --> 52:05.250
- You've put them on the beach.
- I'm just expanding our world.

52:06.168 --> 52:09.254
You've expanded it all the way
to outer space.

52:09.338 --> 52:13.008
- Nigel wants me to...
- I know what Nigel wants. Is it...?

52:13.091 --> 52:14.801
Is it what you want?

52:14.885 --> 52:17.846
It feels like you're jamming in
everything here in a way that...

52:17.930 --> 52:19.264
Jam jars.

52:19.348 --> 52:20.432
Pardon me?

52:20.516 --> 52:23.352
For their space helmets. It's perfect.

52:23.435 --> 52:26.396
Just shove it on.
Little head, the ears down.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.607
Show what it does to the face. It's perfect.

52:30.901 --> 52:33.070
Nigel Basil-Jones.

52:33.153 --> 52:36.782
Just because he's successful,
intelligent, charismatic,

52:36.865 --> 52:39.743
eyes you could lose an afternoon in...

52:39.826 --> 52:41.954
He needs to hear from me.

52:42.037 --> 52:44.122
You lot, stay out of trouble.

52:44.206 --> 52:48.252
Although, I guess I don't need to say that
because Peter's not here.

52:48.335 --> 52:50.087
Where is Peter?

52:51.588 --> 52:54.758
Once again,
I find myself talking to rabbits.

52:54.842 --> 52:57.135
Expecting a response, which...

52:59.555 --> 53:02.599
No. It's not forthcoming. Okay.

53:11.233 --> 53:13.819
Flashlight.

53:13.902 --> 53:16.071
And for our British friends...

53:16.154 --> 53:18.657
Torch.

53:27.749 --> 53:29.376
Never gets old.

53:29.459 --> 53:32.754
If we pull this off,
we'll be on posters all over town.

53:32.838 --> 53:35.883
Why are you up there, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle?

53:35.966 --> 53:38.385
Eye candy.

53:42.014 --> 53:43.599
Cock-a-doodle...

53:43.682 --> 53:45.767
Cock-a-doodle...

53:45.851 --> 53:46.935
Oh, no.

53:47.019 --> 53:48.645
I've lost my voice.

53:48.729 --> 53:50.439
Wake up. Wake up.

53:50.522 --> 53:53.817
We've got to make
the giant ball of fire rise into the...

53:54.818 --> 53:56.403
What?

53:56.486 --> 53:58.030
How is this possible?

53:58.113 --> 54:03.577
It was all a hoax to keep me
from questioning my very existence.

54:03.660 --> 54:07.080
My life's been one big lie!

54:07.164 --> 54:10.876
Wait. But maybe this means I can fly.

54:10.959 --> 54:13.378
Maybe I can fly!

54:15.589 --> 54:16.965
No.

54:17.049 --> 54:19.885
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

54:21.303 --> 54:24.431
<i>As the new day dawned on the empty farm,</i>

54:24.515 --> 54:28.143
<i>it wasn't just Peter and the others off
on a journey of self-discovery.</i>

54:28.227 --> 54:31.355
<i>Bea was also answering
the knock of opportunity.</i>

54:31.438 --> 54:34.691
"Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-Tail,
and Cousin Benjamin,

54:34.775 --> 54:37.069
with help from the others,
rebuilt the cottage,

54:37.152 --> 54:39.488
and they all lived happily ever after."

54:44.868 --> 54:46.954
You are a natural.

54:47.037 --> 54:49.581
Come with me. I have something to show you.

54:51.291 --> 54:54.002
I can't believe you're giving this to me!

54:54.086 --> 54:56.463
I haven't even written a best seller yet.

54:56.547 --> 54:59.633
That's how confident I am in the changes
you're making to the new book.

54:59.716 --> 55:02.344
Have you seen Marvin's latest?

55:03.679 --> 55:05.973
- Is it good?
- The critics have been mixed on it,

55:06.056 --> 55:08.892
but it just hit number one in 23 countries,

55:08.976 --> 55:11.937
including Germany,
and they hate butterflies.

55:12.020 --> 55:15.357
Find them too whimsical.
I want you to meet the whole company.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.026
Branding, merchandising, film.

55:18.110 --> 55:20.320
We don't just think of this
as a book anymore.

55:20.404 --> 55:24.741
We think it's a phenomenon.
We think you are a phenomenon.

55:24.825 --> 55:27.035
<i>A phenomenon, indeed.</i>

55:27.119 --> 55:31.248
<i>But also a phenomenon with a husband
who thought she might be travelling</i>

55:31.331 --> 55:33.333
<i>down the wrong path.</i>

55:33.417 --> 55:36.253
<i>So he went for his own meeting
with the publisher</i>

55:36.336 --> 55:39.214
<i>to do what he was sure was right
for his wife.</i>

55:39.298 --> 55:40.215
Nigel!

55:40.299 --> 55:43.218
- <i>But without telling her, of course.</i>
- Thomas?

55:43.302 --> 55:46.889
What a lovely surprise. Twice in one day.

55:46.972 --> 55:48.557
I know what you're up to, okay?

55:48.640 --> 55:52.060
And it is very clear to me that you are
trying to impose your will on my wife.

55:52.144 --> 55:55.814
- I wanted to tell you to your face...
- I'm heading to the gym. You box?

55:57.482 --> 55:59.193
Yeah. I told you I boxed, didn't I?

55:59.276 --> 56:00.777
- Come with me.
- The only thing is

56:00.861 --> 56:02.654
that I haven't got my gear, so...

56:02.738 --> 56:07.075
- Not to worry. We'll fix you up. Come.
- Really? Okay. Yep.

56:23.175 --> 56:24.968
Hey, Nigel.

56:25.052 --> 56:27.012
Thank you again for the gear.

56:27.095 --> 56:28.722
My niece was happy to lend it to you.

56:33.685 --> 56:36.647
Listen, I need to talk to you about Bea.

56:38.065 --> 56:40.067
You have her doubting her own ideas.

56:40.150 --> 56:42.277
I want her to take on some of mine.

56:42.361 --> 56:46.532
Yeah. I can't help but feel though
that she's losing her way.

56:46.615 --> 56:47.658
- No.
- No?

56:47.741 --> 56:50.369
Losing your way is
when no one buys your book

56:50.452 --> 56:52.204
because it's too niche.

56:52.287 --> 56:55.165
You say "niche"? It's pronounced niche!

56:56.708 --> 56:59.878
And losing your way is
when you want to have children

56:59.962 --> 57:04.591
but your wife is too busy painting pictures
of rabbits going to space!

57:05.676 --> 57:08.762
Space? Really? She's doing that?

57:12.474 --> 57:14.643
Oh, Nigel. Nigel, I'm so sorry.

57:15.644 --> 57:16.812
No, I'm sorry.

57:17.813 --> 57:19.439
But if you're that selfish,

57:19.523 --> 57:21.692
I don't know if you're cut out
to be a father.

57:30.868 --> 57:33.495
Why did you tell Nigel
that I didn't want his ideas?

57:33.579 --> 57:35.247
No, no, no, I was just saying,

57:35.330 --> 57:37.249
I felt you were losing your voice
and integrity.

57:37.332 --> 57:41.044
- But, clearly, I had nothing to worry about.
- You have no right to speak for me.

57:41.128 --> 57:43.672
Nigel said he was going to reduce
the run of the second book

57:43.755 --> 57:46.216
- because it's too "niche"?
- It's pronounced niche.

57:46.300 --> 57:48.552
If you're a pretentious twit.

57:48.635 --> 57:50.345
Like Nigel Basil-Jones?

57:50.429 --> 57:53.223
- How many names does one man need?
- Nigel's parents...

57:53.307 --> 57:55.058
<i>This went on for a while,</i>

57:55.142 --> 57:58.061
<i>as most arguments between grown-ups do.</i>

57:58.145 --> 58:00.772
<i>And they start to say things
that have nothing to do</i>

58:00.856 --> 58:02.900
<i>with what they're actually arguing about.</i>

58:02.983 --> 58:05.527
Brussels is the capital of Belgium.

58:05.611 --> 58:08.405
Capitals have moved before, Bea.
Capitals will move again.

58:08.488 --> 58:11.783
Kyoto, Japan. 1869.
Where are those moving trucks going?

58:11.867 --> 58:12.784
Tokyo!

58:12.868 --> 58:15.162
<i>And often, the argument lasts a week</i>

58:15.245 --> 58:17.414
<i>before they get to the heart of the matter.</i>

58:17.497 --> 58:20.709
<i>But this is a storybook,
so let's get right to it.</i>

58:20.792 --> 58:23.795
I'm finally getting some success,
and I'm determined to hold on to it.

58:23.879 --> 58:28.509
If you could please just support me
instead of going behind my back, okay?

58:28.592 --> 58:29.760
You're right.

58:29.843 --> 58:32.971
I shouldn't have done that.
But this isn't you, Bea.

58:33.055 --> 58:36.308
You paint elegant stories
of the rabbits and our home.

58:36.391 --> 58:38.519
I'm painting our family. It's...

58:38.602 --> 58:41.522
Just happens to be
the best-selling version of our family.

58:42.523 --> 58:44.775
Nigel knows what he's doing.

58:48.153 --> 58:49.613
I love the new you.

58:49.696 --> 58:54.034
I can do anything to you
and you won't eat me. Flick.

58:54.117 --> 58:57.996
Actually, today is my cheat day.

58:58.997 --> 59:00.999
Help! Where is everybody?!

59:01.083 --> 59:06.338
<i>About to pull off the greatest
farmers-market heist in history.</i>

59:06.421 --> 59:08.340
<i>Also, the first.</i>

59:09.341 --> 59:11.969
<i>But Peter's always been a trailblazer,</i>

59:12.052 --> 59:14.221
<i>for better or worse.</i>

59:14.304 --> 59:17.057
This little piggy went to market.

59:17.140 --> 59:20.352
For some lavender soap.
I was told there was a lavender stand?

59:21.353 --> 59:24.815
Peter, may I have a quick word?

59:27.359 --> 59:29.695
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

59:29.778 --> 59:32.531
I've never been more sure
about anything in my life.

59:32.614 --> 59:35.158
Trust me. I would never put you in danger.

59:36.785 --> 59:39.830
Again. I promise.

59:41.290 --> 59:44.751
Okay, I can't promise. We're gonna
rob this place. Are you in or out?

59:50.507 --> 59:51.425
It's time.

59:53.552 --> 59:55.512
- You all know what to do.
- Yes.

59:55.596 --> 59:59.391
We steal the tailor's sausage
and kiss Sara Nakamoto.

59:59.474 --> 1:00:00.601
What? No.

1:00:00.684 --> 1:00:03.687
We take out all the farmers
so we can get to the dried fruit

1:00:03.770 --> 1:00:06.064
and drag it back to the tailor's truck.

1:00:06.148 --> 1:00:07.983
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

1:00:08.066 --> 1:00:10.068
I smell a rat.

1:00:10.152 --> 1:00:12.279
And I like it.

1:00:40.432 --> 1:00:43.810
<i>London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down</i>

1:00:43.894 --> 1:00:45.103
<i>London Bridge is...</i>

1:00:51.652 --> 1:00:53.237
One of these?

1:00:54.238 --> 1:00:56.865
I know. It's lovely, isn't it?

1:00:56.949 --> 1:00:58.325
Two pounds, please.

1:00:58.408 --> 1:01:00.202
Thanks.

1:01:04.873 --> 1:01:08.544
Let's kick this off, son. For your dad.

1:01:11.338 --> 1:01:13.298
- Have a lovely day.
- Bye.

1:01:38.949 --> 1:01:40.993
Magic beans.

1:01:45.497 --> 1:01:46.957
I'm alive!

1:01:59.344 --> 1:02:01.346
Stop, he's not a farmer.

1:02:01.430 --> 1:02:03.432
Really? But he's dressed like one.

1:02:03.515 --> 1:02:07.102
It's a style. Cultural appropriation.

1:02:07.186 --> 1:02:08.854
Makes me sick.

1:02:08.937 --> 1:02:10.856
There's a farmer.

1:02:23.035 --> 1:02:24.745
How are you, sir?

1:02:25.746 --> 1:02:27.998
Here you go. Super looking fennel. Enjoy it.

1:02:31.585 --> 1:02:33.795
- Here you are.
- Thanks very much.

1:02:37.674 --> 1:02:40.260
What did Peter say?

1:02:43.889 --> 1:02:46.266
The rabbit comes out of the hole,

1:02:46.350 --> 1:02:48.101
goes round the tree

1:02:48.185 --> 1:02:50.229
and back down the hole.

1:03:02.574 --> 1:03:04.785
William!

1:03:32.563 --> 1:03:33.564
Peter?

1:03:43.782 --> 1:03:45.492
Come on.

1:03:50.581 --> 1:03:51.957
Head to the petting zoo.

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:55.335
We can blend in
with those weird animals that don't talk.

1:04:08.849 --> 1:04:09.975
Let's go.

1:04:10.976 --> 1:04:12.895
We'll take it from here.

1:04:12.978 --> 1:04:14.396
In you hop.

1:04:23.113 --> 1:04:25.407
- All right, closing time.
- Sure.

1:04:25.490 --> 1:04:28.327
- Oy, what's all this, then?
- Where is everyone?

1:04:33.665 --> 1:04:35.292
Wait.

1:04:44.885 --> 1:04:46.720
- No!
- Hey, Benjamin?

1:04:48.847 --> 1:04:50.599
Wha...? What's going on?

1:04:50.682 --> 1:04:52.809
Let them go! What are they doing?

1:04:52.893 --> 1:04:54.728
Don't get yourself caught too, son.

1:04:54.811 --> 1:04:58.106
But if you did, just be a bigger share
for us, anyway, innit?

1:05:02.027 --> 1:05:03.278
Peter!

1:05:03.362 --> 1:05:04.446
Wait, wait! Peter!

1:05:06.031 --> 1:05:07.950
Come on, let's go.

1:05:08.033 --> 1:05:10.410
No, no, stop. No, no, no, wait. Stop, stop!

1:05:10.494 --> 1:05:12.412
Wait!

1:05:18.168 --> 1:05:19.336
You set us up.

1:05:19.419 --> 1:05:22.840
We didn't not set you up,
if you catch my smell.

1:05:22.923 --> 1:05:24.299
Good one, sis.

1:05:24.383 --> 1:05:28.220
You really thought we were gonna share
all this with those yokels?

1:05:28.303 --> 1:05:29.763
We just needed bodies.

1:05:29.847 --> 1:05:34.643
<i>Sweet, dumb, bumpkin bodies
that will follow you anywhere.</i>

1:05:34.726 --> 1:05:36.436
Is this still part of the plan?

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:37.855
Did Peter do this?

1:05:37.938 --> 1:05:39.565
He's not here, is he?

1:05:39.648 --> 1:05:42.192
Maybe he really is a bad seed.

1:05:44.069 --> 1:05:45.362
Dad was your best friend.

1:05:45.445 --> 1:05:48.365
And my best friend is the Sugar Plum Fairy.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.327
I'm kidding. She's very hard to get to know.

1:05:52.411 --> 1:05:55.080
Closed off. She's Russian.

1:05:55.163 --> 1:05:56.623
You never knew my dad.

1:05:56.707 --> 1:06:00.502
Wouldn't be caught dead
in some country garden.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:01.837
Like he was.

1:06:02.921 --> 1:06:04.131
Why did you do this?

1:06:04.214 --> 1:06:07.509
No one wanted to adopt me anymore.
I was too old.

1:06:07.593 --> 1:06:09.219
I was being replaced.

1:06:09.303 --> 1:06:14.391
<i>Every kid in town wanted a young rabbit
like the one in that book.</i>

1:06:14.474 --> 1:06:17.102
<i>So I tracked you down.</i>

1:06:17.186 --> 1:06:20.981
<i>I was just gonna use you as bait
for a few fake-and-takes.</i>

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:22.691
<i>But then I saw how good you were</i>

1:06:22.774 --> 1:06:26.653
<i>and I figured we could do something
a lot bigger together.</i>

1:06:26.737 --> 1:06:27.654
You lied to me.

1:06:27.738 --> 1:06:31.241
It's not hard to lie to someone
who wants to believe.

1:06:31.325 --> 1:06:33.243
But one thing is dead true.

1:06:33.327 --> 1:06:35.287
We are a great team.

1:06:35.370 --> 1:06:40.459
That's why you're in this truck with us
instead of in a cage with them.

1:06:40.542 --> 1:06:42.669
This is where you belong, Peter.

1:06:42.753 --> 1:06:44.922
We're your family now.

1:06:45.005 --> 1:06:46.048
No.

1:06:46.131 --> 1:06:49.718
My family's in trouble
and it's all my fault.

1:07:29.967 --> 1:07:31.718
No!

1:07:39.268 --> 1:07:40.477
Peter.

1:07:40.561 --> 1:07:42.813
Where are the others?

1:07:45.566 --> 1:07:46.942
What have you done?

1:07:51.947 --> 1:07:55.158
Hey. I need all the addresses
of the people who took those animals.

1:07:55.242 --> 1:07:58.287
We prefer "adopted those animals."

1:07:58.370 --> 1:08:01.957
And that information's private.
Against the law to give it out.

1:08:05.544 --> 1:08:07.212
Go, Peter!

1:08:10.757 --> 1:08:13.427
Right. Here we go.

1:08:13.510 --> 1:08:17.973
"Almond milk, cashew cheese, walnut butter."
This is not the list.

1:08:18.055 --> 1:08:20.434
The man clearly likes
to get his protein from nuts.

1:08:21.643 --> 1:08:24.229
That is everything I have.

1:08:29.902 --> 1:08:34.238
"Manchester, London, Inverness, the Alps."
They're everywhere.

1:08:34.323 --> 1:08:36.908
Do you see the mess you've made?
You're never going to learn.

1:08:36.992 --> 1:08:40.703
Because you never give me a chance.
All you do is tell me how bad I am.

1:08:40.787 --> 1:08:43.497
Well, then stop giving me reasons to.

1:08:43.582 --> 1:08:45.417
Wait, did you just talk?

1:08:45.501 --> 1:08:47.336
No. Yes. Maybe.

1:08:47.419 --> 1:08:49.962
Could be your imagination.
Could be the radio.

1:08:50.046 --> 1:08:53.550
This is BBC 7 playing all of the hits
with none of the talk,

1:08:53.634 --> 1:08:55.676
especially not Peter
because rabbits can't talk.

1:08:55.761 --> 1:08:58.430
Oh, look, the fuel gauge is empty.

1:09:12.861 --> 1:09:14.738
I know I'm not perfect.

1:09:14.821 --> 1:09:16.657
But I can't do anything right by you.

1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:19.408
No matter what I do,
you always assume the worst.

1:09:19.493 --> 1:09:22.955
Well, you got
your entire family taken, Peter.

1:09:23.037 --> 1:09:24.997
If that's not the worst, what is?

1:09:25.082 --> 1:09:28.210
- Why are you even helping me?
- I don't know.

1:09:28.292 --> 1:09:32.631
I just saw you
and the others were in trouble and I came.

1:09:34.299 --> 1:09:35.676
It's not a choice.

1:09:36.926 --> 1:09:40.514
I don't think I'm actually propelling
this thing in any real way.

1:09:40.596 --> 1:09:43.642
I'm sorry I wrecked your tomatoes.
That wasn't supposed to happen.

1:09:43.725 --> 1:09:45.894
Then what was supposed to happen?

1:09:50.482 --> 1:09:53.944
I met someone who made me feel
like not everything I did was wrong,

1:09:54.027 --> 1:09:56.238
who actually accepted me.

1:09:56.321 --> 1:09:57.948
But it was all a lie.

1:09:58.031 --> 1:10:00.033
He just used me. I'm so stupid.

1:10:01.493 --> 1:10:03.412
You're not stupid.

1:10:03.495 --> 1:10:04.663
You're young.

1:10:05.664 --> 1:10:07.165
So you make mistakes.

1:10:07.249 --> 1:10:08.542
A lot of mistakes.

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:10.878
It's the one thing I'm really good at.

1:10:13.088 --> 1:10:15.215
I know I'm too hard on you sometimes.

1:10:16.216 --> 1:10:21.138
I lost my father when I was very young too,
so I never really learned how to be one.

1:10:22.139 --> 1:10:23.182
To me?

1:10:24.516 --> 1:10:27.186
Yeah. To you.

1:10:27.269 --> 1:10:29.188
And to the others.

1:10:30.189 --> 1:10:32.232
That's why I'm here, I suppose.

1:10:32.316 --> 1:10:33.984
It's what a dad does.

1:10:34.067 --> 1:10:39.031
- I didn't think I'd ever have a dad again.
- I didn't realise I already was one.

1:10:41.408 --> 1:10:43.911
You're not the bad seed, Peter.

1:10:44.912 --> 1:10:49.082
- I shouldn't have let them call you that.
- And I shouldn't have believed it.

1:10:49.166 --> 1:10:52.044
I know now that no one can tell me who I am.

1:10:57.466 --> 1:11:01.678
I think there's someone we both love
who needs to hear that too.

1:11:03.597 --> 1:11:07.476
About me talking,
it's probably your imagination.

1:11:07.559 --> 1:11:12.272
And you might also want to imagine
that your truck isn't rolling down the hill.

1:11:13.273 --> 1:11:14.733
No!

1:11:14.816 --> 1:11:18.153
Stop the truck!
Please stop the truck! No! No!

1:11:18.237 --> 1:11:20.405
No! No!

1:11:20.489 --> 1:11:21.657
Oh, no!

1:11:21.740 --> 1:11:23.033
No!

1:11:23.116 --> 1:11:25.661
No! No!

1:11:25.744 --> 1:11:29.206
No, no.

1:11:29.289 --> 1:11:30.499
No!

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:32.209
<i>So, what do you think, Bea?</i>

1:11:32.292 --> 1:11:34.127
Pretty original.

1:11:34.211 --> 1:11:35.712
And that's just one idea

1:11:35.796 --> 1:11:39.007
the team came up with
for a possible movie version.

1:11:40.133 --> 1:11:43.303
They don't really look or act
like my rabbits though.

1:11:43.387 --> 1:11:44.805
We couldn't be more excited, Bea.

1:11:44.888 --> 1:11:47.891
Your latest changes have brought us
almost to the finish line.

1:11:47.975 --> 1:11:49.434
- Yes, yes.
- So close.

1:11:49.518 --> 1:11:51.979
But I do think
some of your pages are missing.

1:11:52.062 --> 1:11:55.691
The end is just the rabbits drinking tea
and apologising to each other.

1:11:55.774 --> 1:11:59.403
Oh, no, that's right. That's how they act.
They learn from their mistakes.

1:11:59.486 --> 1:12:03.323
I think what we're trying to say is,
the ending is really important.

1:12:03.407 --> 1:12:05.993
It's the only thing readers remember.

1:12:06.076 --> 1:12:10.330
Okay, well, what about
if one of them goes into the village

1:12:10.414 --> 1:12:12.708
to get a birthday present?

1:12:14.376 --> 1:12:16.211
- And gets kidnapped.
- Yes!

1:12:16.295 --> 1:12:18.380
They should all get kidnapped.

1:12:18.463 --> 1:12:21.675
There can be a rescue mission,
exotic locations all over the country,

1:12:21.758 --> 1:12:23.343
even outside the country.

1:12:23.427 --> 1:12:26.263
And you can have chases
on many different types of vehicles,

1:12:26.346 --> 1:12:27.472
like race cars.

1:12:27.556 --> 1:12:30.517
- Boats, motorcycles, planes.
- That they can jump out of.

1:12:30.601 --> 1:12:34.062
Then they can team together
to get revenge on a gang of bad guys.

1:12:34.146 --> 1:12:36.273
And then they ride off into the sunset.

1:12:36.356 --> 1:12:38.192
But the sky should be pink.

1:12:38.275 --> 1:12:41.153
Because that's the colour of hope
and the future.

1:12:42.654 --> 1:12:47.534
Now, if the ending is as action-packed
as we all agreed it should be...

1:12:47.618 --> 1:12:49.995
I don't know if we all agreed.

1:12:50.078 --> 1:12:51.872
Bea!

1:12:51.955 --> 1:12:53.582
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1:12:53.665 --> 1:12:54.875
Thomas!

1:12:54.958 --> 1:12:57.544
- So good to see you.
- Nigel.

1:12:57.628 --> 1:13:00.130
And you brought Peter. Terrific.

1:13:00.214 --> 1:13:04.635
Now we can show everyone
what Peter would look like in zero gravity.

1:13:07.095 --> 1:13:10.224
Mopsy! Cotton-Tail!
Let's get back to the rocket ship.

1:13:12.768 --> 1:13:14.269
Nigel, stop it!

1:13:14.353 --> 1:13:16.438
- What?
- Goodness me.

1:13:16.522 --> 1:13:18.982
Come here. Are you okay, sweetie?

1:13:19.066 --> 1:13:21.151
- Bea, the other rabbits were taken.
- What?

1:13:21.235 --> 1:13:25.072
And the pig and the duck and the hedgehog,
and is there a badger?

1:13:25.155 --> 1:13:29.159
- Yeah, I need your car to go and get them.
- My goodness.

1:13:30.744 --> 1:13:33.205
How did this happen? What have I done?

1:13:33.288 --> 1:13:35.999
You've written 80 percent of a best seller.

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:37.709
Just get some more rabbits.

1:13:37.793 --> 1:13:41.213
You can get a million more
with the money you're about to make.

1:13:41.296 --> 1:13:44.508
No. I'm very sorry, but I can't do this.

1:13:44.591 --> 1:13:47.386
- This isn't my world.
- Not your world?

1:13:47.469 --> 1:13:48.929
Look around you.

1:13:49.012 --> 1:13:52.015
You created all this.

1:13:52.099 --> 1:13:54.268
This is your world.

1:13:54.351 --> 1:13:57.563
There's no boat chases or skiing
in my world.

1:13:57.646 --> 1:14:00.107
And there's certainly
no rabbits jumping out of planes.

1:14:00.190 --> 1:14:02.150
Bea.

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.528
What are you doing?

1:14:04.611 --> 1:14:09.157
Do you know how much I've put into this?
How much you have put into this?

1:14:09.241 --> 1:14:11.869
- I guess...
- Don't look in his beautiful eyes.

1:14:13.036 --> 1:14:15.622
I need to go and get my family, Nigel.
Goodbye.

1:14:15.706 --> 1:14:18.000
Your books will never go anywhere
without me.

1:14:18.083 --> 1:14:21.712
This is the last the world will ever hear
about Peter Rabbit.

1:14:21.795 --> 1:14:23.505
I'll take my chances.

1:14:23.589 --> 1:14:25.132
Come on, Peter.

1:14:28.427 --> 1:14:29.887
Goodbye, Nigel.

1:14:32.723 --> 1:14:34.266
Oh, we're making a terrible mistake.

1:14:34.349 --> 1:14:36.226
- What can we do to make...?
- Thomas!

1:14:41.398 --> 1:14:43.275
Okay, where are we on Winnie the Pooh?

1:14:44.359 --> 1:14:47.654
- Okay, where's the first stop?
- 440 Riverside Drive.

1:14:47.738 --> 1:14:50.699
- Did you just talk?
- Let's say it was just the radio.

1:14:50.782 --> 1:14:54.161
This is BBC 7 playing all the hits
with none of the...

1:14:54.244 --> 1:14:57.664
<i>So away they went to retrieve
the rest of their family.</i>

1:14:57.748 --> 1:15:00.125
- There we are.
- <i>The first was easy.</i>

1:15:00.209 --> 1:15:02.002
- Okay, number two.
- Here we go.

1:15:03.545 --> 1:15:06.715
<i>The next was a little pricklier.</i>

1:15:13.180 --> 1:15:16.517
<i>But the rest were much trickier.</i>

1:15:17.518 --> 1:15:21.188
Hello. There's been a misunderstanding
in regards to the custody of that rabbit.

1:15:21.271 --> 1:15:24.024
I promised the missus stew.

1:15:25.025 --> 1:15:27.444
<i>So they set off on a rescue mission,</i>

1:15:27.528 --> 1:15:32.241
<i>the likes of which Bea insisted
never happened in her world.</i>

1:15:39.498 --> 1:15:42.918
Benjamin, I'm really sorry.
Listen, I never should have...

1:15:43.001 --> 1:15:45.128
Not now, Peter. Get me out of here!

1:15:45.212 --> 1:15:46.630
Yep.

1:15:58.642 --> 1:16:00.602
They're the rabbits from that book.

1:16:01.603 --> 1:16:03.647
Benjamin, I'm really sorry. Listen...

1:16:03.730 --> 1:16:06.233
- Not now either.
- Right. Right.

1:16:25.252 --> 1:16:27.171
No!

1:16:27.254 --> 1:16:29.089
We're too late! We're too...

1:16:29.173 --> 1:16:30.966
- Felix is gone!
- Get up.

1:16:31.967 --> 1:16:34.011
Come on, let's go. Quick. Quick.

1:16:34.094 --> 1:16:36.263
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Hey.

1:17:26.897 --> 1:17:29.233
Brake lights.

1:17:41.787 --> 1:17:43.121
Oh, thank goodness.

1:17:43.205 --> 1:17:47.042
But could you come back in 25 minutes?
This is doing wonders for my skin.

1:17:47.125 --> 1:17:48.335
Hey!

1:17:49.336 --> 1:17:51.505
Hey, that's my pig!

1:18:28.292 --> 1:18:31.253
And that's why I'm on the billboard.

1:18:39.761 --> 1:18:42.306
"Lavatory"? That's what it means?

1:18:42.389 --> 1:18:44.391
The place where men read the newspaper?

1:18:44.474 --> 1:18:46.560
Yeah. You don't have to change your name.

1:18:46.643 --> 1:18:50.439
There's no one in the world
I'd rather be confused with than you, Flops.

1:18:50.522 --> 1:18:52.608
Same here, Mops.

1:18:55.819 --> 1:18:57.946
<i>With everyone safely reunited,</i>

1:18:58.030 --> 1:19:01.742
<i>they headed back to Gloucester
for one final rescue,</i>

1:19:01.825 --> 1:19:05.287
<i>which Peter knew to be
the most dangerous of all.</i>

1:19:14.463 --> 1:19:16.381
I underestimated you, son.

1:19:19.885 --> 1:19:23.096
This whole time,
I thought I was the one playing you.

1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:26.058
Looks like I was the one being played.

1:19:29.436 --> 1:19:31.104
Where's the rest of it?

1:19:33.524 --> 1:19:35.275
Same place this is going.

1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:37.277
With us.

1:19:37.361 --> 1:19:39.947
- You know who you're dealing with?
- Yeah.

1:19:40.030 --> 1:19:42.574
The guy who got me to put
my family in danger.

1:19:42.658 --> 1:19:44.868
But that's not your fault. It's mine.

1:19:44.952 --> 1:19:46.787
I convinced them.

1:19:46.870 --> 1:19:49.122
I believed this is who I was.

1:19:49.206 --> 1:19:50.290
Now I know better.

1:19:50.374 --> 1:19:52.125
You don't know nothing, kid.

1:19:52.209 --> 1:19:54.753
Oh, no. You did teach me a couple of things.

1:19:54.837 --> 1:19:57.297
Oh, yeah? Like what?

1:19:57.381 --> 1:20:01.552
Once a week, the old tailor upstairs drives
to the market to buy his sausage.

1:20:01.635 --> 1:20:03.846
It's a real love story. What of it?

1:20:03.929 --> 1:20:05.722
And the second thing is:

1:20:05.806 --> 1:20:07.808
The rabbit comes out of the hole,

1:20:07.891 --> 1:20:09.476
goes around the tree

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.645
and back down the hole.

1:20:11.728 --> 1:20:13.146
What?

1:20:39.173 --> 1:20:40.841
The kid, the kid!

1:20:40.924 --> 1:20:44.094
When this truck stops, I'm gonna get him.

1:20:44.178 --> 1:20:47.723
You nincompoop, don't you know
where this truck always parks?

1:20:47.806 --> 1:20:50.434
Yeah. The market. At the entrance.

1:20:50.517 --> 1:20:52.561
Right next to the...

1:21:04.489 --> 1:21:07.075
This reminds me of the first time
I was put in a cage.

1:21:07.159 --> 1:21:09.036
The circus was in town, and I'd always...

1:21:09.119 --> 1:21:10.662
Whiskers, stay focused.

1:21:10.746 --> 1:21:14.416
On what? Being captured
and getting our comeuppance?

1:21:14.499 --> 1:21:18.420
Anyway, they only hired bats,
so I made a costume out of gym socks.

1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:21.131
There we are.

1:21:34.937 --> 1:21:37.356
You were right.
I should have just supported you.

1:21:37.439 --> 1:21:40.484
I think I was just worried
the book would take you away

1:21:40.567 --> 1:21:43.529
from the family I wanted us to have,
you know?

1:21:43.612 --> 1:21:45.322
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1:21:45.405 --> 1:21:48.200
I was chasing something
for all the wrong reasons.

1:21:48.283 --> 1:21:50.744
I lost sight of what was important.

1:21:50.827 --> 1:21:52.079
Our family.

1:21:52.162 --> 1:21:56.875
And families, I've learned,
can come in all shapes and sizes.

1:21:56.959 --> 1:22:01.171
Nigel wanted me to use
those exact words to end my book.

1:22:01.255 --> 1:22:02.756
You're kidding.

1:22:03.799 --> 1:22:08.262
I mean, the sentiment's nice,
but how pathetic.

1:22:08.345 --> 1:22:10.138
- Right? Right?
- Pathetic? Yeah.

1:22:10.222 --> 1:22:12.307
That's why I said it, to make you laugh.

1:22:12.391 --> 1:22:15.686
- Nigel, he was pathetic. You want some tea?
- Lovely.

1:22:15.769 --> 1:22:17.396
Benjamin, is now the time

1:22:17.479 --> 1:22:20.941
for my often interrupted
yet heartfelt apology?

1:22:22.234 --> 1:22:23.235
I'm sorry.

1:22:23.318 --> 1:22:25.487
I never should have mixed you up
in all this.

1:22:25.571 --> 1:22:28.490
I got caught up worrying
about who everyone thought I was,

1:22:28.574 --> 1:22:32.619
instead of who I really am,
which is your brother.

1:22:32.703 --> 1:22:38.917
And your cousin, who continues to not listen
to you but promises to really, really try.

1:22:39.001 --> 1:22:40.085
I'm sorry.

1:22:40.169 --> 1:22:41.837
What...?

1:22:43.130 --> 1:22:44.840
I'm kidding.

1:22:44.923 --> 1:22:48.343
But, really, Peter, from now on,
you need to think things through

1:22:48.427 --> 1:22:52.222
and take some advice
from those who love you.

1:22:52.306 --> 1:22:57.311
I'm sorry. Wha...?

1:23:07.362 --> 1:23:10.157
Sunset.

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:26.757
<i>And so, they all lived happily ever after,</i>

1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:28.425
<i>as is the law in these storybooks.</i>

1:23:28.509 --> 1:23:32.012
You just take this out, and...

1:23:34.097 --> 1:23:35.224
There.

1:23:36.225 --> 1:23:38.352
<i>Bea and McGregor had a child of their own.</i>

1:23:38.435 --> 1:23:41.438
<i>And the rabbits took to her
like a real sister.</i>

1:23:42.773 --> 1:23:44.525
Peekaboo.

1:23:44.608 --> 1:23:46.276
Peekaboo. Peekaboo.

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:47.945
Peekaboo!

1:23:48.028 --> 1:23:49.905
Try this jelly bean. It'll change your life.

1:23:49.988 --> 1:23:51.532
Cotton-Tail, no.

1:23:51.615 --> 1:23:53.033
Cute baby.

1:23:53.116 --> 1:23:57.538
Right, well, if anybody needs me,
I'm gonna swim to France and back.

1:23:58.997 --> 1:24:02.042
I finally realised what made me different.

1:24:02.125 --> 1:24:04.127
I'm the narrator of these stories.

1:24:04.211 --> 1:24:06.839
Another classic, Flopsy.
What are you gonna name it?

1:24:06.922 --> 1:24:08.215
She already did.

1:24:11.468 --> 1:24:14.012
I like it. Implies there might be more.

1:24:14.096 --> 1:24:17.516
Or this could be it.
We didn't think we'd get this far.

1:24:30.404 --> 1:24:33.115
Hey, squirrel,
why don't you take it from here?

1:24:33.198 --> 1:24:34.867
I couldn't possibly.

1:24:34.950 --> 1:24:38.120
<i>We are young, we run green</i>

1:24:38.203 --> 1:24:41.206
<i>Keep our teeth nice and clean</i>

1:24:41.290 --> 1:24:44.168
<i>See our friends, see the sights</i>

1:24:44.251 --> 1:24:46.545
<i>Feel all right</i>

1:24:46.628 --> 1:24:48.505
Okay. That's enough.

1:24:48.589 --> 1:24:50.841
- Thanks.
- Yep.

1:26:12.422 --> 1:26:15.342
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:26:17.469 --> 1:26:19.763
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:26:19.847 --> 1:26:21.306
Wait a second.

1:26:21.390 --> 1:26:22.808
Dad, wake up!

1:26:22.891 --> 1:26:25.060
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:26:26.103 --> 1:26:28.772
You made the magical water fountains erupt,

1:26:28.856 --> 1:26:33.110
wetting the earth so it won't burn up
from the giant ball of fire!

1:26:33.193 --> 1:26:36.029
It's not a sham! We do matter!

1:26:36.113 --> 1:26:38.156
We have a purpose!

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:40.659
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1:26:40.742 --> 1:26:43.537
We're back, baby!

1:26:44.705 --> 1:26:47.207
But we still can't fly.
