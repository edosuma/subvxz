<i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.257 --> 00:03.711
There's a bomb
in Sykes' wheelchair!

00:03.780 --> 00:05.748
How did you know
about that?

00:05.814 --> 00:09.251
You came into my house
and stole from me,

00:09.319 --> 00:11.153
and I will respond
in kind.

00:11.221 --> 00:13.055
Someone from Artie's past

00:13.123 --> 00:14.089
has been breaking
into the Warehouse

00:14.157 --> 00:15.658
and sending out artifacts.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.426
Basically undoing his life's
work as a Warehouse agent.

00:17.494 --> 00:19.261
But nothing's showing up
on the security feeds.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.630
Which would explain why
I've been having the mega-vibes.

00:21.698 --> 00:23.632
But not why Artie's been
keeping us out of the loop.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.434
Or what black diamonds mean.

00:25.502 --> 00:26.802
He's probably just trying
to protect us.

00:26.870 --> 00:30.339
Yes, but from whom?

00:30.407 --> 00:33.042
[Sighs heavily]

00:33.109 --> 00:35.311

Now I'm 5'10 1/2".

00:42.652 --> 00:44.253
I did not make this up.

00:44.321 --> 00:46.522
Yeah, trust me,
we've heard stranger.

00:46.590 --> 00:47.923
Please be careful.

00:47.991 --> 00:49.425
We're always careful.

Says here, uh, Mr. Byck,
that you updated

00:55.966 --> 00:57.866
your online dating profile
on Tuesday.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.235
Yes, women consistently
prefer taller men,

01:00.303 --> 01:01.937
which they should.

01:02.005 --> 01:03.238
Taller men on average
are more successful,

01:03.306 --> 01:05.107
and they make more money.

01:05.175 --> 01:06.709
Yeah, well,
Tom Cruise is 5'7",

01:06.776 --> 01:09.478

Also...

01:09.546 --> 01:11.113

01:11.181 --> 01:13.015
But that was
before it got painful?

01:13.083 --> 01:16.218
When this started,
I didn't care how or why.

01:16.286 --> 01:17.386
I was thrilled.

01:17.454 --> 01:18.621
But I have enough things
wrong with me.

01:18.688 --> 01:20.022
I don't need all my joints
to ache too.

01:20.090 --> 01:23.192
Asthma, heartburn...

01:23.259 --> 01:26.295

Hey, these are all

01:28.465 --> 01:29.431
I've cracked the code.

01:29.499 --> 01:31.867
Would you please--

01:31.935 --> 01:33.335
Jeez.

01:33.403 --> 01:34.837
Mr. Byck,
what's wellness anxiety?

01:34.904 --> 01:36.205
Hypochondria.

01:36.272 --> 01:38.007
I might have that too.

01:38.074 --> 01:40.275
Both: Nooo.

01:42.245 --> 01:44.113
It's hard to believe
Commander Data over there

01:44.180 --> 01:46.281
hasn't found his soul mate.

01:46.349 --> 01:48.417
You think Artie just sent us
on a wild goose chase

01:48.485 --> 01:49.918
to get us out
of the Warehouse?

01:49.986 --> 01:52.454
Well, whatever he's keeping
secret from us,

01:52.522 --> 01:54.590
Steve and Claudia'll find out,
and they'll let us know.

01:54.658 --> 01:56.825
Hmm.

01:56.893 --> 01:59.361
Pete...

01:59.429 --> 02:04.033
Look, he--he's taller
than the stove hood now.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.702
It's not a wild goose chase
after all.

02:06.770 --> 02:07.836
Hey, Leena.

02:07.904 --> 02:10.538
Barry Byck
has improved his dunk.

02:10.607 --> 02:12.241
So have two others.
I'm sending over the info now.

02:12.308 --> 02:14.009
A John Tufano, near you,
and a Lisa Bernardo

02:14.077 --> 02:18.047
on the other side of town.

02:18.114 --> 02:20.749
And I suddenly realized
I was taller.

02:20.817 --> 02:23.285
I was trying out a new recipe
for the potluck--

02:23.453 --> 02:24.386

02:24.454 --> 02:25.587
Yeah, maybe I should just--

02:25.655 --> 02:26.822
And all of the sudden,

02:26.889 --> 02:29.424
I could reach the pots
hanging above the range

02:29.492 --> 02:31.193
that I couldn't reach before.

02:31.260 --> 02:35.864

Artie, so far,
there's been four cases.

03:09.098 --> 03:11.800
There's no telling how
widespread this thing could get.

03:11.868 --> 03:13.835
Yeah, they start out
with just getting taller,

03:13.903 --> 03:15.771
but pretty quickly,
it escalates to really painful.

03:15.838 --> 03:18.006
Gotta figure eventually
it's gonna be, "Now I'm dead."

03:18.074 --> 03:20.876
There's no obvious connection
between the victims so far.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.419
So go talk to Mr. Seklir.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.721
Artie, what are you doing?

03:32.789 --> 03:36.124
I'm organizing
my wire collection.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.634
Well, then, I got nothing.

03:45.701 --> 03:48.970
So what about, um,
Paul Bunyan's axe

03:49.038 --> 03:50.305
or David's slingshot?

03:50.373 --> 03:52.574
Or how 'bout
a magical bag of beans?

03:52.642 --> 03:54.409
We got the axe.
We got the slingshot.

03:54.477 --> 03:56.244
The beans? Please.
That's just a fairytale.

03:56.312 --> 03:59.081

- You first.

to do with your new bling?

04:15.665 --> 04:17.165
Wh-where did you--
where did you get that?

04:17.233 --> 04:20.101
We found it in the dark vault,
where Alice's mirror used to be.

04:20.168 --> 04:21.470
That's not unlike the box
of them we found

04:21.536 --> 04:23.071
in that garage filled
with artifacts, is it?

04:23.139 --> 04:24.906
Now, you said you were gonna
tell everyone about that, Artie.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.908
I did not.
I said I would handle it.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.276
I said there was a protocol
to these things.

04:28.344 --> 04:30.946
If I know my Warehouse
backbone architecture,

04:31.013 --> 04:33.648
and I think we can all agree
that I do,

04:33.716 --> 04:34.883
I'd say you
were trying to fix

04:34.951 --> 04:36.518
the artifact removal
detection system,

04:36.586 --> 04:38.186
since obviously
it's been on the fritz.

04:38.254 --> 04:39.221
Someone's been getting
in and out

04:39.288 --> 04:40.822
and stealing artifacts.

04:40.890 --> 04:43.225
And the burning question
on every agent's mind is,

04:43.292 --> 04:44.759
why are you trying to hide it
from us?

04:44.827 --> 04:46.394
Did it ever occur to you
that part of my job

04:46.462 --> 04:48.897
is deciding what is and what
is not part of your job,

04:48.965 --> 04:50.599
and the reason
I'm not telling you something

04:50.666 --> 04:52.667
may just be
because I am protecting you?

04:52.735 --> 04:54.469
Yes, that did occur to us.

04:54.537 --> 04:55.937
We also considered crankiness,
senility,

04:56.005 --> 04:57.005
and Artie's
just sugar-crashing.

died on this job.

by Alice because of this.

that to dying?

what we're up against,

how are we supposed
to defend ourselves?

with something huge.

our first victim,

06:01.270 --> 06:02.971
wasn't he taking
heartburn medication?

06:03.039 --> 06:04.706
What wasn't he taking?

06:04.774 --> 06:07.630
Although Reduxid
does sound familiar.

06:07.794 --> 06:09.344
Okay, we need to check
on Barry Byck

06:09.412 --> 06:11.480
and confirm
that's what he's taking,

06:11.547 --> 06:14.282
then find out if Tufano and
Bernardo were taking it too.

06:21.257 --> 06:24.026
Gil, we're getting
some odd reports

06:24.093 --> 06:26.294

in South Bend, Indiana.

06:26.362 --> 06:27.929

are getting taller.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.908
True, but on the flip side,

06:39.976 --> 06:41.843
this could lead to possible
treatments for osteoporosis

06:41.911 --> 06:45.781

He's gonna look for something
to slow the effect.

07:34.225 --> 07:35.826
He'll send it to the hotel
if he finds it.

07:35.893 --> 07:37.127
Yeah, but what does
a heartburn pill have to do

07:37.195 --> 07:38.395
- with an artifact?
- I don't know.

07:38.463 --> 07:40.464
Maybe it's some sort
of chemical in the pill

07:40.531 --> 07:41.465
that interacts
with the artifact

07:41.532 --> 07:42.666
when someone touches it.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.067

for something

07:44.135 --> 07:46.103

touched in common.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.537
Pete, look at this.

07:47.605 --> 07:50.140
Byck and Tufano, both of them
were prescribed Reduxid

07:50.208 --> 07:53.310
by the same gastroenterologist,
a-a Dr. Selden.

07:53.377 --> 07:55.679
Maybe the artifact is,
I don't know, at his office.

07:55.746 --> 07:57.147
Well, it's a place to start.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.381
And maybe while we're there,

07:58.449 --> 07:59.749
he can give me something
for my gas.

07:59.817 --> 08:00.984

he's a doctor,

08:37.455 --> 08:38.955
and only a handful of doctors
are prescribing it

08:39.023 --> 08:41.491
in a select few cities.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.293
Did you treat all four
of these patients?

08:43.361 --> 08:45.595
No, only Byck and Tufano.
I don't know the others.

08:45.663 --> 08:48.031
- Can I help you?
- Um, uh--

08:48.099 --> 08:49.566
so this isn't the connection.

08:49.634 --> 08:50.734
Uh, maybe we need to check
the pharmacy

08:50.801 --> 08:52.302
where they got the pills.

08:52.370 --> 08:54.804
No, Byck and Tufano went
to different drugstores.

08:54.872 --> 08:56.973
Can I ask
what you're looking for?

08:57.041 --> 08:58.675
And, uh,
can I be a part of this?

08:58.743 --> 09:00.110
Hi. Me again.

09:00.178 --> 09:01.678
Right.

09:01.746 --> 09:04.548
Uh, look, I know we had
a little thing out there

09:04.615 --> 09:06.183
with the chin,

09:06.250 --> 09:07.384
but this
is official business.

09:07.451 --> 09:09.886
Deb Stanley,
Moorpark Pharmaceutical.

09:09.954 --> 09:11.154
We make Reduxid.

09:11.222 --> 09:12.789
[Intercom beeps]
Dr. Selden,

09:12.857 --> 09:14.691
Mr. Lieber is getting
very impatient.

09:14.759 --> 09:17.727
Mr. Lieber
and his spastic colon.

09:17.795 --> 09:19.763
Excuse me.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.398
We would be very interested
to know if our pill

09:21.465 --> 09:22.699
is making people taller.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.935
It's not just making
people taller.

09:25.002 --> 09:27.070
There are four people
currently in critical condition

09:27.138 --> 09:28.805
- in the ICU.
- I didn't know that.

09:28.873 --> 09:31.274
Okay, if it is the pill,

09:31.342 --> 09:32.542
it can't just be
the pill.

09:32.610 --> 09:34.544
Right? I keep tabs
of all the doctors

09:34.612 --> 09:35.812
that are participating
in the trial,

09:35.880 --> 09:37.414
and whatever's going on,

09:37.481 --> 09:39.216
it's only happening
here in South Bend.

09:39.283 --> 09:40.684
So if the FDA
wants to get involved--

09:40.751 --> 09:43.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not the FDA, okay?

09:43.688 --> 09:45.088
We're the Secret Service.

09:45.156 --> 09:46.856
Does the president
have heartburn?

09:46.924 --> 09:49.759
- Wouldn't you?
- Ms. Stanley,

09:49.827 --> 09:51.161
we're not going
after your company,

09:51.229 --> 09:53.263
and we already know
that this is only happening

09:53.331 --> 09:54.531
in South Bend, so--

09:54.599 --> 09:55.932
We're trying to help
these people.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.701
- Good. Me too.
- Well, uh,

09:57.768 --> 09:59.236
then you can get us a list
of all the patients

09:59.303 --> 10:01.371
who are taking
Reduxid currently

10:01.439 --> 10:02.606
that live in the city.

10:02.673 --> 10:03.840
Do you have a subpoena?

10:03.908 --> 10:05.475
[Snickers]

10:05.543 --> 10:06.710
I know. <i>Subpoena.</i>

10:06.777 --> 10:08.078
It's kind of a funny word,
right?

10:08.145 --> 10:10.480
- It just sounds like--
- Pete.

10:10.548 --> 10:11.815
It's okay. I grew up
with three brothers.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.650
- Ah.
- Penis. It sounds like penis.

10:13.718 --> 10:15.185
Okay.
So...

10:15.253 --> 10:18.054
You guys are looking
for some environmental factor.

10:18.122 --> 10:20.557
Right? Some place that
the affected patients have been

10:20.625 --> 10:22.726
or something
that they've done in common?

10:22.793 --> 10:23.860
Something like that.

10:23.928 --> 10:25.362
Then we work together.

10:25.429 --> 10:26.463
- Oh--
- Kay. Okay.

10:26.530 --> 10:27.497
- But--
- Okay.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.899
Okay. So.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.636
Patient info is all by code
for confidentiality.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.671
Now, I don't have the name
of the patients.

10:34.739 --> 10:35.772
I only have
the doctors' numbers.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.073
But I can call them.

10:37.141 --> 10:38.341
I can ask them to have
the patients talk to us.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.243
We still have to look
into those four victims

10:40.311 --> 10:41.678
that we already know about.

10:41.746 --> 10:42.946
Why don't we split up?

10:43.014 --> 10:44.214
You dig into the four
we know,

10:44.282 --> 10:47.050
and I'll go play doctor
with Deb.

10:49.487 --> 10:50.787
"Brother" Adrian?

10:50.855 --> 10:54.324
As in Brotherhood
of the Black Diamond?

10:54.392 --> 10:55.625
How--how did you--

10:55.693 --> 10:56.626
Well, as soon as we found
the diamonds,

10:56.694 --> 10:58.094
I did some surfing.

10:58.162 --> 10:59.562
They're a secret society
in France.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.632
Yeah, well, s-secret society
doesn't quite capture it.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.602
One of the last offshoots
of the Knights Templar.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.437
So what's their beef
with us?

11:07.505 --> 11:09.039
Not us. Me.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.641
Brother Adrian has a grudge
against me personally.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.009
So that's why he's been
stealing artifacts

11:13.077 --> 11:14.311
that are meaningful to you.

11:14.378 --> 11:15.312
A grudge?
More info, please.

11:15.379 --> 11:16.980
He's trying to force me

11:17.048 --> 11:20.050
to do something
that I...I can't do.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.284
What--what does he--

11:21.352 --> 11:22.786
What that is
I can't tell you.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.187
Suffice it to say
it would be bad,

11:24.255 --> 11:25.689
and that's all you get.

11:25.756 --> 11:28.992
I'm maxed out on my
sharing quota for the day.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.226
Okay, we'll wait outside.

11:30.294 --> 11:34.164
We're just trying
to help you here.

11:34.231 --> 11:37.033
[Sighs]

11:37.101 --> 11:38.501
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

11:38.569 --> 11:41.137
"I'm sorry" and "Thank you"
in the same sentence?

11:41.205 --> 11:42.305
Keep your eye out
for four horsemen.

11:42.373 --> 11:44.074
It turns out
the Mayans were right.

11:44.141 --> 11:45.408
How is this guy
even getting in?

11:45.476 --> 11:46.776
I mean, there've been
no security breaches,

11:46.844 --> 11:49.245
no break-ins,
no unauthorized open doors.

11:49.313 --> 11:51.047
Well, he's using an artifact,
isn't he?

11:51.115 --> 11:52.816
One would assume.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.584
So do you have any idea
how to find him?

11:54.652 --> 11:55.552
Uh, yeah, I've got
a number,

11:55.619 --> 11:57.020
but I've tried tracing it.

11:57.088 --> 11:58.855
It's routed through
all these anonymous handoffs.

11:58.923 --> 12:00.690
- It's impossible.
- [Laughs] Oh, Artie.

12:00.758 --> 12:03.259
You are adorable.
This is why you ask for help.

12:03.327 --> 12:04.794
The number, please.

12:08.032 --> 12:11.768
Anyone you tell
will be in grave danger.

12:11.836 --> 12:15.839
[Cell phone ringing]

12:15.906 --> 12:17.006
Oh, Secret Service stuff.

12:17.074 --> 12:19.676
- Ah.
- Hey, Mykes. Anything?

12:19.744 --> 12:22.011
No, there's no connection
between any of the victims yet.

12:22.079 --> 12:23.513
What about you?

12:23.581 --> 12:26.783
How goes it with the, uh,
second ex-future-Mrs. Lattimer?

12:26.851 --> 12:30.053
Not bad, not bad.

12:30.121 --> 12:33.656
She's not half the hard-ass
we made her out to be at first.

12:33.724 --> 12:35.091
Hey, Mykes, uh,

12:35.159 --> 12:37.260
we just hit the last
of the docs on the list,

12:37.328 --> 12:39.662
and none of the other patients
are getting any taller.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.831
So it is limited
to a small group.

12:41.899 --> 12:42.932
Okay, you know what?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.200
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital

12:44.268 --> 12:45.468
and see if any of the victims
can talk.

12:45.536 --> 12:46.536
You stick with Deb.

12:46.604 --> 12:47.704
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.072
I mean, there's still
some connection

12:49.140 --> 12:51.441
involving Reduxid
that we haven't figured out,

12:51.509 --> 12:54.077
so, you know,
work your boyish charm.

12:54.145 --> 12:55.311
Investigate.

12:55.379 --> 12:57.180
All right, well,
twist my arm.

12:57.248 --> 12:58.748
You tell the President
I'll call him back

12:58.816 --> 13:00.283
when I'm good and ready.

13:00.351 --> 13:01.351
[Phone beeps]
Sorry.

13:01.419 --> 13:02.719
Yeah.

13:02.787 --> 13:04.754
So, Deb,
I gotta tell you,

13:04.822 --> 13:07.257
you were, uh, pretty good
with the docs in there.

13:07.324 --> 13:10.226
Wow. Sound more surprised.

13:10.294 --> 13:11.494
It is what I do.

13:11.562 --> 13:12.629
[Chuckles]
No, I know.

13:12.696 --> 13:14.330
It's just, uh,
you know,

13:14.398 --> 13:16.266
when we first met, I--
I don't know.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.934
I thought you were gonna be
a little more--

13:18.002 --> 13:19.903
Hard-ass?

13:19.970 --> 13:21.471
I meant it
in the best possible way.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.674
As in, "wow, hard ass."

13:24.742 --> 13:27.944
It's not exactly the compliment
a girl's looking for.

13:28.012 --> 13:29.245
You can bounce a quarter
off of mine.

13:29.313 --> 13:30.880
I do not want to know
how you know that.

13:30.948 --> 13:32.682
- [Laughs]
- Anyway,

13:32.750 --> 13:34.584
as it happens,
I like doctors.

13:34.618 --> 13:36.619
My dad was one.
He's gone now.

13:36.687 --> 13:38.154
Oh, mine too.

13:38.222 --> 13:40.657
Uh, dead, not a doctor.

13:40.724 --> 13:43.426
Also, sorry.

13:43.494 --> 13:46.996
So why didn't you follow
in his footsteps?

13:47.064 --> 13:48.231
Did you ever notice
how most doctors

13:48.299 --> 13:49.999
already seem
to know everything?

13:50.067 --> 13:51.868
What, you don't find that
attractive?

13:51.936 --> 13:54.237
Oh, no, no, no.
You're hiding that very well.

13:54.305 --> 13:56.406
Ah, see, there's that
hard-ass thing again.

13:56.474 --> 14:01.711
Point is, I prefer working
in new drug development.

14:01.779 --> 14:05.348
And I like being in a field
that's still discovering.

14:05.416 --> 14:09.185
I mean, the world's full
of surprises, right?

14:15.693 --> 14:17.393
[Loud knock at door]

14:17.461 --> 14:19.929
- [Inhales sharply]
- What time is it?

14:19.997 --> 14:21.931
A little after 4:00.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.032
- Pete, it's me.
- [Gasps]

14:23.100 --> 14:24.767
- Hurry!
- Pete!

14:24.835 --> 14:27.370
[Huffing and puffing]

14:27.438 --> 14:31.007
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:31.075 --> 14:35.178
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:35.246 --> 14:36.446
[Loud knocking]
Ooh! Dress! Okay.

14:36.514 --> 14:37.580
Open the door.

14:37.648 --> 14:39.249
- Oh, hey, Myka.
- Hey.

14:39.316 --> 14:41.351
Yeah, I'm sleeping, and--
and--okay.

14:41.418 --> 14:43.319
Get dressed, okay?

14:43.387 --> 14:44.954
Leena picked up a 9-1-1 call
from a new victim,

14:45.022 --> 14:46.556
and Artie sent us this,

14:46.624 --> 14:50.093
the gold spike that completed
the transcontinental railroad.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.861
It pulls things together.
He thinks it might...

14:51.929 --> 14:55.265
slow... the symptoms...

14:55.332 --> 14:56.766
You slept with her,
didn't you?

14:56.834 --> 14:59.536
Well, you--you told me
to investigate, okay?

14:59.603 --> 15:01.704
So...

15:01.772 --> 15:03.406
She's unarmed.

15:03.474 --> 15:04.841
You know what?
Just get dressed, okay?

15:04.909 --> 15:06.676
Just--oh!

15:06.744 --> 15:07.710
What?

15:07.778 --> 15:11.180
Okay, so this new victim

15:11.248 --> 15:12.615
is a Christian scientist,
all right?

15:12.683 --> 15:13.983
Which means he doesn't have
a doctor.

15:14.051 --> 15:16.252
So he never took the pills.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.488
The pill has nothing to do
with this.

15:18.556 --> 15:21.257
Why are you such a slut?

15:21.325 --> 15:22.692
Oh, Myka,
would you please just go?

15:22.760 --> 15:23.960
I'll be out in a minute.

15:24.028 --> 15:26.896
I'm leaving.
Fine. Fine.

15:26.964 --> 15:28.865
Slut.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.767
[Door slams]

15:33.737 --> 15:35.338
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:35.406 --> 15:36.339
Hi, Deb.

15:36.407 --> 15:37.974
This--this was great.

15:38.042 --> 15:40.877
Okay? I mean, this was--
this was really great.

15:40.945 --> 15:42.645
And I'm not--
I'm not just saying it, okay?

15:42.713 --> 15:44.647
And I-I'm sorry that
I have to run off and all,

15:44.715 --> 15:46.649
but I just don't want you
to think that I'm,

15:46.717 --> 15:47.617
you know, that guy--

15:47.685 --> 15:48.718
Pete, listen.

15:48.786 --> 15:49.719
I'm a big girl, you know.

15:49.787 --> 15:50.954
Occasionally, I'm that guy.

15:51.021 --> 15:52.722
- Oh, okay. Dude.
- Yeah.

15:52.790 --> 15:55.892
That's--

15:56.780 --> 15:58.414
But you would've called me,
though, right?

15:58.459 --> 16:00.697
I mean...

16:00.764 --> 16:02.265
Anyway, good news.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.701
Uh, there's--there's no
connection to your pill.

16:04.768 --> 16:06.803
So the last guy
who got taller,

16:06.870 --> 16:08.004
he didn't even take it,
so--

16:08.072 --> 16:10.139
Okay. Uh, wow.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.708
Well, so what do we do next?

16:11.775 --> 16:14.310
Oh, we--

16:14.378 --> 16:17.013
Wow. We--we--we don't--
we don't do anything.

16:17.369 --> 16:18.430
Your company's in the clear.

16:18.494 --> 16:20.242
But listen,
I gotta go, okay?

16:20.289 --> 16:21.451
But--but, Pete.
No, look.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.452
Hey, hey, hey.

16:22.519 --> 16:24.187
I didn't just come here to cover
my company's butt, you know?

16:24.254 --> 16:26.189

I'm sorry, okay?
I--

16:32.045 --> 16:34.063
You can't.

16:34.131 --> 16:37.200
I'll call you though, okay?
I'll call.

16:37.267 --> 16:38.201
[Door slams]

16:38.268 --> 16:40.169

We're onsite now.

All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

17:02.459 --> 17:04.661
Okay, Secret Service.

17:04.728 --> 17:06.829
Now, I need you to move
this vehicle ASAP.

17:06.896 --> 17:07.997
Copy that.

17:08.065 --> 17:09.732
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.733
All right,
I'm gonna help you.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.068
I need you to grab this.

You're gonna be okay.

All right.

17:25.182 --> 17:28.184
Certainly don't wanna
interfere with Secret Service.

17:28.252 --> 17:31.320
What's that?
Go for Red Zebra 34.

17:31.388 --> 17:33.056
What? He changed his route?

17:33.123 --> 17:34.891
Agh, that guy's a pain
in my--

17:34.958 --> 17:36.993
All right, dudes.
Well, as you were.

17:39.296 --> 17:40.797
But don't worry.

17:40.864 --> 17:42.265
I'll get you

I'm onto something bigger.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.707
These Secret Service agents,

they're part of some group

- This could be huge for us.
- I know, but listen.

This growing thing,
it's really bad.

18:51.112 --> 18:52.779
We've gotta figure out a way
to help these people.

18:52.864 --> 18:54.131
Of course, of course.

we take away whatever artifact
he's using,

20:16.514 --> 20:17.414
take it into the Warehouse.

21:35.526 --> 21:37.561
what if what they have
in--in common

21:37.629 --> 21:39.196
is the symptom?

21:39.263 --> 21:42.065
I mean, heartburn's caused
by lifestyle.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.868

eating habits.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.237
Do you still have those

had a spike

21:54.445 --> 21:56.146
in their heartburn
on the same night.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.915
A couple days later,
they started to get taller.

21:58.983 --> 22:02.185
Oh, so what'd they do
on the 16th?

22:02.253 --> 22:06.556

all his receipts by date.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.727
Here, on the 16th,

22:10.795 --> 22:12.929
he took a-a cooking class
at a cooking school

22:12.997 --> 22:14.064
called Le Cordon Bend.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.499
He probably did it
to meet girls.

22:15.566 --> 22:17.034
Right, well,
here's their website.

22:17.101 --> 22:18.335
Ah, and lookee there.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.370
The class was taught
by victim number five,

Karl Irving.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.940
Tastes of the Mediterranean.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.475

a new recipe?

the same cooking class.

22:30.982 --> 22:34.251
"Karl's specialty
is exotic, spicy foods."

Well, when it's placed
at the base of anything,

23:32.777 --> 23:34.077
it creates an opening.

Yep, Moorpark Pharmaceutical
bought the whole school.

24:09.430 --> 24:10.997

and development

24:11.065 --> 24:12.198

- She used me.
- Yes.

24:18.105 --> 24:19.472
Hi, guys.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.574
Uh, there's a Deb Stanley here
who says she knows you

24:21.642 --> 24:23.576
and is asking
all sorts of questions.

24:23.644 --> 24:24.644
Isn't that interesting?

24:24.712 --> 24:26.546
Oh, my God.

24:26.614 --> 24:30.216
This is, like, the worst
one-night stand ever.

24:30.284 --> 24:31.885
Okay, look, Mykes.

24:31.952 --> 24:34.421
I get a really good vibe
off of her,

24:34.488 --> 24:37.557
and I-I-I think
that--that Deb truly believes

24:37.625 --> 24:39.059
that what she's doing
is right.

24:39.126 --> 24:41.628
So I'll just tell her
that whatever she's found

24:41.695 --> 24:44.397
she has to give back
or else people are gonna die,

24:44.465 --> 24:46.232
and--and I think
she'll give it back.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.668
And how are you going
to deny what we do

24:48.736 --> 24:53.139
and admit that a cooking utensil
has the power to kill?

24:53.207 --> 24:55.141
- You are so smart.
- Look, we'll just--

24:55.209 --> 24:57.944
we'll bag it faster
if we go to Minneapolis.

24:58.012 --> 24:59.412
So we'll split up, okay?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.614
I'll go get the artifact,
and you go home

25:01.682 --> 25:02.816
and clean up your mess.

25:02.883 --> 25:05.885
Or--or maybe you
could talk to Deb.

25:05.953 --> 25:08.321
Yeah, no, never mind.

25:08.389 --> 25:09.989
Please don't still be there.
Please don't still be there.

25:10.057 --> 25:11.758
Please.

25:11.826 --> 25:13.626
Um, the Secret Service
doesn't house their agents

find me here?

I got your travel records.

Okay, a little stalker-y.

25:23.037 --> 25:24.938
Look, I know
I rocked your world,

25:25.005 --> 25:27.140
but you can't
just follow me home.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.175
Oh, yeah.
That's why I'm here.

25:29.243 --> 25:31.211
You're gonna have to put
a ring on it.

25:31.278 --> 25:32.412
- Really?
- No.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.514
- What?
- Look, I found out

25:34.582 --> 25:36.749
that you guys were around
a couple of years ago

25:36.817 --> 25:39.419
when a wrestling team
got buff quick.

25:39.487 --> 25:40.653
Yeah, another time,
there were rumors

25:40.721 --> 25:42.822
some old ladies
got miraculously younger.

25:42.890 --> 25:45.024
Things like this,

25:45.092 --> 25:47.227

of finding new drugs.

25:47.294 --> 25:48.394
But every time
I dug further,

25:48.462 --> 25:50.763
the stories got buried,
and I think--

25:50.831 --> 25:52.665
I think that you guys
are the ones who buried them.

for your own safety,

25:54.835 --> 25:56.169

25:59.740 --> 26:01.040
Are they gonna put a bullet
in my head?

26:01.108 --> 26:02.709
Maybe.

26:02.776 --> 26:04.911
Pete, I've seen
this movie before.

26:04.979 --> 26:06.813

Why am I so irresistible?

26:12.186 --> 26:14.687

I thought it was a myth too.

But I have it
from a very trusted source.

does exist,

26:25.633 --> 26:27.800
the government has no right
to suppress it.

of the lost opportunity

committee won't regret it.

down here,

in case we saw him.

No, no, it's choppy.

27:18.619 --> 27:20.853
What were those shots?
Are you all right?

27:20.921 --> 27:22.055
We think that Brother Adrian

27:22.122 --> 27:23.289
may have stashed the plank
down here,

27:23.357 --> 27:24.357
but now he might be heading
your way.

27:24.425 --> 27:27.093
He made himself look
like you.

for years.

27:55.289 --> 27:56.656
Don't shut me out now.

27:56.724 --> 27:59.025
Okay, look, whatever you think
you're onto,

27:59.093 --> 28:01.194
or whatever you think
you saw,

28:01.262 --> 28:02.195

May I have a word?

28:13.340 --> 28:14.440
Uh...

28:16.610 --> 28:19.245
A senator who had no idea
about the Warehouse yesterday

28:19.313 --> 28:21.481
is today calling the White House
and asking about it.

28:21.548 --> 28:23.583
Oh, God, Mr. Kosan,
I'm so sorry.

28:23.651 --> 28:25.118
Ms. Stanley

28:25.185 --> 28:27.720

of influence.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.656
They're pressuring
the senator

28:29.723 --> 28:32.025
to grant them access
to our facility.

28:32.092 --> 28:33.359
Well, can they do that?

28:33.427 --> 28:35.028
Can't Mrs. Frederic
just make it go away?

28:35.095 --> 28:37.864
Mrs. Frederic is on her way

but there are no guarantees.

28:39.199 --> 28:40.500
[Sighs]

28:40.567 --> 28:42.468
The Warehouse has always had
a delicate relationship

28:42.536 --> 28:43.670
with the government
that hosts it.

28:43.737 --> 28:45.271
All right, well,

28:45.339 --> 28:47.407
don't the regents have a plan
for this sort of thing?

28:47.474 --> 28:50.143
We do.

28:50.210 --> 28:52.278
It's very messy.

28:52.346 --> 28:54.414
And borders on treason.

28:54.481 --> 28:55.815
Yeah.

28:55.883 --> 28:57.450
Maybe we don't want
to go there just yet.

28:57.518 --> 29:00.186
There is an alternative,

29:00.254 --> 29:01.454
but it relies on you.

M-me?

She's almost Myka smart.

29:22.810 --> 29:25.545
Hmm.

to consider another option.

30:14.810 --> 30:15.877

30:15.945 --> 30:17.212
I've worked here
for three years,

30:17.279 --> 30:18.680
and I have yet to see
a wall, so--

30:18.747 --> 30:20.348
How long has it been here?

30:20.416 --> 30:22.350
Uh, I don't know.
About a hundred years.

30:22.418 --> 30:24.485
But--but Warehouses like it
have--have existed

30:24.553 --> 30:25.853
for way longer.

30:25.921 --> 30:28.523
I mean, like, since,
like, Alexander The Great.

30:28.591 --> 30:29.757
It's incredible.
The things in here--

30:29.825 --> 30:32.393
I mean, it can--
we could extend life.

30:32.461 --> 30:34.062
We could cure disease.

30:34.129 --> 30:36.397
You could end hunger
and misery.

30:36.465 --> 30:38.099
Uh, yeah,
the thing is, Deb,

30:38.167 --> 30:40.101
what you're looking at,
all this stuff,

30:40.169 --> 30:42.503
I mean, it's thousands of years
of people doing

30:42.571 --> 30:44.505
the smartest thing
they could do,

30:44.573 --> 30:45.840
and that's locking it
all away,

30:45.908 --> 30:47.575
because it all has
a downside,

30:47.643 --> 30:49.477
and it's usually
pretty nasty.

30:49.545 --> 30:51.646
Everything has a downside.
Come on.

30:51.714 --> 30:52.947
Fire has a downside.

30:53.015 --> 30:54.182
We just have to learn
how to control it.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.516
Yeah, but this can't be
controlled.

30:55.584 --> 30:57.018
I mean, it's not science.

30:57.086 --> 31:00.154
Science isn't science
until it is.

31:00.222 --> 31:02.690
Isaac Newton believed
in the occult.

31:02.758 --> 31:05.159

to accept quantum mechanics.

We still don't even know
what all of our DNA does.

is over?

than a drug exec talking.

Why is this so important
to you?

31:24.546 --> 31:27.382
My dad had Parkinson's.

31:30.286 --> 31:34.922
He was a brilliant man,
and his body betrayed him.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.257
In the end,
he couldn't walk.

31:36.325 --> 31:38.926
He couldn't speak.

31:38.994 --> 31:41.629
What if you've got something
in here that could help

31:41.697 --> 31:44.499

before it's too late for them?

31:49.204 --> 31:51.306

I want to show you something.

31:59.815 --> 32:01.983
This artifact...

32:02.051 --> 32:04.452
could have cured your dad.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.787
But to use it,

32:05.854 --> 32:09.023
you have to give the disease
to someone else.

32:16.565 --> 32:18.366
but it turns you
into a serial killer.

we don't use those.

32:20.836 --> 32:22.136
It's not that simple, Deb.
Okay?

32:22.204 --> 32:23.738

32:23.806 --> 32:27.108
that could wipe out a country
or start a famine.

about some of it

the right thing?

always do the right thing?

containing evil.

35:26.054 --> 35:29.991
You know that I'm right
about this.

35:30.058 --> 35:31.859
I can see that
you're afraid of it.

35:32.027 --> 35:33.628
Don't talk to me
about my life.

35:33.695 --> 35:34.795
You know nothing about me.

35:34.863 --> 35:36.764
I know everything
about you.

35:36.832 --> 35:39.200
And I'm going to keep
dismantling your life

35:39.267 --> 35:41.469
until you comply,

35:41.536 --> 35:44.438
erasing every good deed
you ever did,

35:44.506 --> 35:48.809
isolating you from everyone
you've ever cared about.

35:48.877 --> 35:51.946
[Softly]
Everyone I care about.

35:52.434 --> 35:53.724
Everyone I care...

35:56.685 --> 35:58.052
[Farnsworth beeps]
Claudia!

35:58.463 --> 35:59.496
Steve, stop!

35:59.820 --> 36:00.785
Do not--

36:00.820 --> 36:03.024
Don't move!
Can you hear me?

36:03.091 --> 36:05.726
[Static]

36:05.794 --> 36:08.796
[Suspenseful music]

36:08.864 --> 36:16.637
â™ª

36:18.403 --> 36:19.507
Claudia!

36:24.654 --> 36:26.355
Claudia, Steve!

36:26.422 --> 36:29.424
[Suspenseful music]

36:29.492 --> 36:37.332
â™ª

36:37.400 --> 36:39.635
Breathe, Obi Wan.
We heard you.

36:39.702 --> 36:41.737
We found a trip wire,
so we tripped it.

36:41.804 --> 36:43.839
On purpose.
Thanks for the heads-up, Artie.

36:43.906 --> 36:45.121
Yeah.

36:47.677 --> 36:50.012
I-I-I was afraid that you
were buried alive again.

36:50.079 --> 36:52.080
What?

36:52.148 --> 36:54.116
- Uh, what?
- Again?

36:54.183 --> 36:56.952
Why do you only listen to me
when I don't want you to?

37:02.759 --> 37:04.626
Oh, good.

37:07.597 --> 37:09.031
Thanks again
for coming, Senator.

37:09.098 --> 37:10.332
This had better be
worth it, Gil.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.267
I'm missing two important votes
on the floor.

37:12.335 --> 37:13.435
Oh, trust me, Don,

37:13.503 --> 37:14.670
you'll be glad
I showed you this.

37:14.737 --> 37:18.307
My associate assures me
it's a phenomenon.

37:18.374 --> 37:20.175
This way, gentlemen.

37:22.393 --> 37:23.656
Welcome...

37:23.703 --> 37:25.977
to storage space six.

37:28.099 --> 37:29.453
This?

37:30.727 --> 37:32.531
This is the secret
government stash

37:32.622 --> 37:35.557
that's gonna blow the lid
off Washington?

37:35.625 --> 37:37.092
[Toy whizzes]

37:37.160 --> 37:40.863
If I were you, Gil,
I'd fire my associate

37:40.930 --> 37:42.664
and find someone who's not
gonna waste my time

37:42.732 --> 37:45.467
and make you
look like an idiot.

37:49.005 --> 37:51.840
So Myka says the artifact
was a marble bowl.

37:51.908 --> 37:53.609
Looks like it was carved
from the ruins

37:53.676 --> 37:55.711
of the Colossus of Rhodes.

37:55.779 --> 37:57.780
She also talked
to the people at the hospital.

37:57.847 --> 38:00.015
I guess everybody there
is okay.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.273
Good.

38:01.497 --> 38:03.165
Well, maybe one of them
is hiring,

38:03.224 --> 38:05.758
'cause I'm pretty sure
I just got myself fired.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.857
Yeah. Sorry about that.

38:11.773 --> 38:13.974
So what made you change
your mind?

38:14.041 --> 38:16.865
Did I--did I charm you
again, or--

38:16.933 --> 38:19.729
I saw the rod
of Asclepius down there.

38:19.887 --> 38:21.471
That's the original, huh?

38:21.527 --> 38:22.928
Oh, yeah.
[Chuckles]

38:23.003 --> 38:24.603
That baby almost took off
my hand one time.

38:24.804 --> 38:26.538
It's an interesting story.
We were in Egypt, and--

38:26.583 --> 38:28.487
Hippocratic oath.
You know, that's my dad's oath.

38:28.568 --> 38:29.868
First, do no harm.

38:30.249 --> 38:33.080
So I think probably
the best no harm I can do

38:33.128 --> 38:36.464
is to help
keep this place secret.

38:36.868 --> 38:38.994
Ms. Stanley.

38:39.604 --> 38:40.993
Agent Lattimer,
would you excuse us?

38:41.076 --> 38:43.678
Oh, uh, well...

38:43.777 --> 38:45.252
Yeah. Are--are you--

38:45.354 --> 38:47.322
are you gonna erase
her memory?

38:47.495 --> 38:48.495
If you don't remember me,

38:48.618 --> 38:50.052
when you hear,
"hey, hey, hey"--

38:50.096 --> 38:52.096
- Agent.
- Yes.

38:53.269 --> 38:55.303
[Clears throat]

38:55.371 --> 38:57.773
Thank you
for your assistance today.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.075
After I caused
the whole problem.

39:00.143 --> 39:03.057
We'll call it
a learning curve.

39:04.143 --> 39:06.048
You don't strike me
as government issue.

39:06.116 --> 39:09.651
What is your part
in all of this?

39:09.719 --> 39:11.386
I'm a member
of what you might call

39:11.454 --> 39:13.455
a civilian oversight board.

39:13.523 --> 39:16.492
We're known as the Regents.

39:16.559 --> 39:19.328
You're the ones who decided
to let me in on this today.

39:19.395 --> 39:21.296
We rely heavily
on the input of our agents.

39:21.364 --> 39:23.532
Well, Pete's a really good
guy, you know.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.800
You should hang on to him.

39:24.868 --> 39:29.004
We intend to.

39:29.072 --> 39:30.405
When someone tries
as hard as you did

39:30.473 --> 39:33.208
to find the Warehouse
and then shows considerable

39:33.276 --> 39:35.899
wisdom in their actions,

39:36.246 --> 39:39.448
perhaps they're meant to be
part of what we do.

39:39.649 --> 39:43.085
Sometimes that's how
we find new regents.

39:43.153 --> 39:44.820
Might that interest you?

39:44.888 --> 39:46.388
Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

39:46.431 --> 39:49.313
Well, you know, uh...

39:50.262 --> 39:51.796
It might, you know.

39:51.863 --> 39:56.133
Good. Then we'll continue
our discussions.

39:56.232 --> 39:59.067
And time will tell.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.107
Put that down.

40:05.175 --> 40:06.175
Oh.
[Glass shatters]

40:06.242 --> 40:08.177
[Laughs]

40:08.244 --> 40:11.246
[Majestic music]

40:11.314 --> 40:13.248
â™ª

40:13.316 --> 40:14.583
You were great.

40:14.651 --> 40:15.951
All right, so the big bad
brother is on the run.

40:16.019 --> 40:17.452
It's time to apply
pressure, right?

40:17.520 --> 40:18.820
Right, now he can't get
into the Warehouse anymore--

40:18.888 --> 40:20.455
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

40:20.523 --> 40:22.658
You were right, I was handling
too much for myself,

40:22.725 --> 40:24.493
and I did need your help,
so thanks.

40:24.561 --> 40:26.528
- That's why we're here.
- And here comes the--

40:26.596 --> 40:28.564
<i>But</i> there is still
a part of this

40:28.631 --> 40:30.766
I can't tell you
because even knowing about it

40:30.833 --> 40:33.168
would put people
in danger.

40:33.236 --> 40:34.736
So this is where
your involvement ends.

40:34.804 --> 40:36.939
You are done.
Understood?

40:37.006 --> 40:38.956
- But Artie--
- Okay.

40:43.713 --> 40:44.646
We're not done, are we?

40:44.714 --> 40:46.415
Not by a mile.

40:47.850 --> 40:48.951
[Light knocking]

40:49.018 --> 40:52.054
[Ominous music]

40:52.121 --> 40:56.425
â™ª

40:56.492 --> 40:58.327
I presumed you'd rather
we speak alone.

40:58.394 --> 41:00.095
You presumed right.

41:00.163 --> 41:01.430
Did you find the knife?

41:01.497 --> 41:04.499
I have a few leads.

41:04.567 --> 41:07.436
There's something we need
to discuss first.

41:07.503 --> 41:08.570
Something that's been
on my mind.

41:08.638 --> 41:10.172
What would that be?

41:10.240 --> 41:11.773
When you pled on my behalf
to the Regents,

41:11.841 --> 41:14.276
I understand you spoke
with great certainty

41:14.344 --> 41:17.713
that I would lay down my life
for the Warehouse.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.314
Uh, yes, well,

41:19.382 --> 41:20.949
I'm a good judge
of character.

41:21.017 --> 41:23.919
Yes, you are.

41:23.987 --> 41:26.955
But are you also a good judge
of wheelchairs?

41:27.023 --> 41:29.157
You quite suddenly knew
that Mr. Sykes

41:29.225 --> 41:30.692
had brought a bomb
with him

41:30.760 --> 41:32.194
and precisely where
it was hidden.

41:32.262 --> 41:33.996
Do you know how long
I've been doing this job?

41:34.063 --> 41:35.197
I had an instinct.

41:35.265 --> 41:36.865
Artie, if there's
one subject

41:36.933 --> 41:39.935
I'm rather a world-class expert
on, it's time travel.

41:40.003 --> 41:42.571
Bit of an unhealthy
obsession once, really.

41:42.639 --> 41:44.673
And the more I've thought
about it, the more I'm convinced

41:44.741 --> 41:48.543
it's the only explanation
for your behavior.

41:48.611 --> 41:50.312
- N-no, it's not.
- You knew things

41:50.380 --> 41:51.913
the rest of us couldn't

41:51.981 --> 41:54.716
because you've been ahead
in time and come back again.
