- Hot tea for my milady?
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.832
With the wedding coming up,
what do you think about

00:06.919 --> 00:08.617
the two of us
taking dance lessons?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.793
What are you talking about?
I'm already a fine dancer.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.926
Some might say,
a dancin' machine.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.972
Well, I do love
the Mike Biggs signature

00:16.059 --> 00:18.061

air punch.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.673
I call that my
"Rock 'em sock 'em robot."

00:21.760 --> 00:23.110
I've been known
to clear a dance floor

00:23.197 --> 00:25.155
with that thing.

00:25.242 --> 00:28.332
Oh, yeah, I've seen it.
One, two, punch, punch, punch..

Hey, I throw in a couple
of hitch-hikes

00:34.817 --> 00:36.688

00:36.775 --> 00:38.560
Gimme a little fries
with that shake.

00:40.301 --> 00:43.608
If you have a dollar,
I'll give you a lap dance.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.523
Yeah, bring it on,
Cinnamon Britches.

00:47.351 --> 00:51.007
I'm just doing this
to work my way through college.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.186
You guys are so cute.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.972
- Aren't they cute?
- Adorable.

- Nice to meet you.

this is Mike and Molly.

My parents are Eileen and Gary.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.816
Well, it seems like Eileen
and Gary did a very good job.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.994
- Where did you two meet?
- Gas station.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.953
Oh. You work at the gas station?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.346
I wish.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.393
Can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.047
Sure.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.527
Be right back, baby.

he's a musician.'

01:45.844 --> 01:47.107

about this guy.'

he could be a serial killer!'

are you?

02:05.647 --> 02:06.648
Nope.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.171
I only asked
because of your

02:08.258 --> 02:09.564
"Manson-esque" quality.

It's cool.

'Hey, be quiet!
He thinks I'm jailbait!'

02:26.189 --> 02:28.800
Let me ask your opinion
as a musician.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.547
Do you think I need
to take dance lessons?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.854
That depends.
Are you dancing now?

02:41.813 --> 02:45.165

Uh, a little after 4:00.

Well, you need to get him out

- He can leave when he gets up.
- No!

- Dylan is not a thief.

to get pretty hot.

to be all graceful

You're taking dance classes?
Can I go watch that?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.392
- No ma'am, I do not.
- Why not?

10:54.479 --> 10:56.046
Because that "pie-hole" comment

10:56.133 --> 10:58.658
kind of knocked the marbles
out of my bag.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.181
One, two, three.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.618
- Two, two, three.
- Eyes up.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.054
How am I supposed to know
what my feet are doing?

11:06.274 --> 11:07.928
I'm the only adult
living there.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.625
I have to make sure
the bills get paid

11:09.712 --> 11:12.497
I have to maintain the house
and work a full-time job.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.064
And if it wasn't for me,
those two would be living

11:14.151 --> 11:16.371
in a dumpster, fighting cats
for chicken bones.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.288
- Eyes up.
- Yeah, I got it.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.246
I'm gonna dry-gulch that broad.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.208
You know what? I'm done
being the responsible one.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.253
They can live their lives
however they want.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.995
Different man every night,
wine glasses in the shower

11:32.082 --> 11:33.605
I don't care anymore.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.347
They think I'm too controlling,
well, no more.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.219
So you think maybe I could
lead for a little while?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.699
Oh, yeah, sorry.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.356
[laughs]

11:45.443 --> 11:46.662
Hey, you know what would be
a great first dance

11:46.749 --> 11:47.707
at the wedding?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.230
The limbo.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.101
- You can't do the limbo.
- Doesn't matter.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.712
Bride and groom hold the stick.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.280
There you are.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.195
Well, while you've been out
dancing the night away

11:58.282 --> 12:00.632
your sister's upstairs.
packing to move out.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.243
What? That's horrible.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.375
Please, she threatens
to move out once a month.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.727
- She packed her bong.
- Alright, I'll go talk to her.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.125
What family doesn't have
its share of drama, huh?

12:15.212 --> 12:16.561
- Pie-hole.
- Got it.

12:23.307 --> 12:26.267
Wow, you actually
got moving boxes this time.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.748
Not your normal
stomping down the stairs

12:28.835 --> 12:30.880
carrying a pair of shoes
and a diaphragm.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.450
Thank you for reminding me.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.366
Come on.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.063
I know you're doing this
just to get back at me.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.587
No, I'm not.
You don't know everything.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.807
See, here's your stupid iPod.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.420
- What are you doing with it?
- Thought it was my lighter.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.249
So who's the idiot now?

12:57.515 --> 12:59.039
You know, none of this
would've happened

12:59.126 --> 13:00.910
if Molly hadn't given Victoria
such a hard time

13:00.997 --> 13:02.303
about that creepy boy.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.826
Mm-hm.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.697
I mean, not that Molly
hasn't brought home

13:05.785 --> 13:07.134
her fair share of losers.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.050
No offense.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.399
Mm-hm.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.357
Hey, either add
to the conversation

13:13.444 --> 13:15.577
or go wait in the garage
with all the other tools.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.234
You really want my opinion?

13:20.321 --> 13:21.801
'Cause, you know, it's gonna
come out of my pie-hole.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.329
- Spill it.
- Alright.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.113
I think Molly might be
a bit overprotective

13:30.200 --> 13:32.594
of her sister
because sometimes

13:32.681 --> 13:35.640
you're kinda more
of a friend than a parent.

13:35.727 --> 13:36.990
You calling me a bad mother?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.513
No, I'm calling you
a good friend.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.126
Let me tell you something,
there's one parent

13:43.213 --> 13:45.172
in this house,
and you're looking at her.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.522
All I hear is,
"Mommy, I need this."

13:47.609 --> 13:51.134
"Mommy, I need that.
Mommy, can I borrow $2800?"

13:51.221 --> 13:53.441
Wow, Victoria owes you $2800?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.399
No. The smart one does.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.015
Oh, come on,
Victoria, stop this.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.408
You know I love you and I just
want what's best for you.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.803
Well, then you need
to let this eagle soar.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.587
I am not trying to keep you
from soaring.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.719
I'm trying to keep you
from flying

14:10.806 --> 14:12.329
into a homeless shelter.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.896
I have to move out of here

14:13.983 --> 14:15.724
or you'll never treat me
like an adult.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.814
That's not true, I just want you
to make smarter choices.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.252
Molly, the smart choices are
not always the right choices.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.562
- Yeah, they kind of are.
- Here we go.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.564
It's just like Mike said,
you're a pit bull

14:29.651 --> 14:31.958
and I gotta get as far away
from you as I can.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.049
Mike said that?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.442
Let me tell you something,
if-if I had a dollar

14:38.529 --> 14:40.357
for every time Molly wanted
to borrow money from me

14:40.444 --> 14:43.317
she'd wanna borrow that, too.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.580
Alright, Victoria's moving out.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.755
Mike, why don't you help her

14:46.842 --> 14:48.931
since this was your
brilliant idea?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.890
- What?!
- You told my baby to move out?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.456
- God, no.
- Oh!

14:52.543 --> 14:54.806
Don't remember telling
the eagle to soar, huh?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.418
How about calling yourfiance
a pit bull?

14:57.505 --> 15:01.117
Now, before you see it
as a bad thing..

15:01.204 --> 15:03.641
Pit bulls are actually sweet,
loving dogs.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.166
It's the owners
who make them mean.

15:06.253 --> 15:09.473
Is that another shot
at how I raised my kids?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.649
God, no.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.261
Mom, I love you,
but I have to do this.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.743
It's the only way,
right, Mike?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.310
Ooh, look, Victoria

15:20.397 --> 15:22.704
if this is about our
conversation on the front porch

15:22.791 --> 15:23.792
you shouldn't pay
any attention to me.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.446
I really got my head up my ass.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.101
It'd sure fit.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.364
And why are you listening to him
in the first place?

15:30.451 --> 15:33.410
Contrary to popular opinion,
Molly

15:33.497 --> 15:36.283
I'm the parent in this house.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.415
You told her what I said?

15:38.502 --> 15:40.243
Hey, some people aren't good
with secrets

15:40.330 --> 15:42.811
some people aren't good
with money.

15:42.898 --> 15:45.292
Pie-hole!

15:45.379 --> 15:47.772
I told you I would pay you back
with our wedding money.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.339
Wait, you're already
spending our wedding money?

15:49.426 --> 15:51.211
Mike, now is not the time!

15:52.734 --> 15:54.301
And I don't appreciate you
gossiping

15:54.388 --> 15:55.911
about me to myfiance.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.044
Oh, I'm sorry, mommy.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.046
Are you gonna send me to bed
without any supper?

16:00.133 --> 16:03.223
What difference would it make?
You drink your dinner, anyway!

16:03.310 --> 16:04.964
Hey, I am the one moving out.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.444
This is supposed to be about me!

16:07.531 --> 16:09.272
See, I told you,
it's all for show!

16:09.359 --> 16:11.753
Oh, I know that!
But a good mother fakes concern!

16:11.840 --> 16:14.408
Stop it! Stop it!
You're tearing me apart!

16:21.328 --> 16:23.983
And just so you know, I've had
exactly two glasses of wine!

16:24.070 --> 16:27.682
Those aren't glasses,
they're aquariums with stems!

16:27.769 --> 16:29.118
[Joyce]
'Hey, if it wasn't for the wine'

16:29.205 --> 16:30.815
'the two of you
wouldn't even be here.'

16:30.902 --> 16:31.903
[Molly]
'Yeah? With the way you drink'

16:31.991 --> 16:33.644
'I should have 15 sisters!'

16:35.342 --> 16:37.779
Don't worry, Molly.
You'd still be the smart one!

16:37.866 --> 16:40.651
[glass shatters]

16:40.738 --> 16:42.653
[Victoria]
'Why do we even
have a lamp there?'

16:51.749 --> 16:54.491
[sighs]

16:54.578 --> 16:56.189
I can't go back in there, Carl.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.494
I've made a mess of things

16:57.581 --> 16:59.496
and two of them have
seen me wet and naked.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.934
Lot of victims
in that scenario.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.504
But look,
this is the life you've chosen

17:07.591 --> 17:09.376
so suck it up
and get in that house.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.552
- Will you come in with me?
- Hell, no.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.337
Can I come home with you?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.774
Man, cowardice does
not become you.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.081
This is what being
in a relationship is all about.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.691
You know, you're not just
marrying her

17:20.778 --> 17:22.345
you're marrying all three
of them crazy bitches.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.436
What happened to my life?

17:26.523 --> 17:29.396
I'm living in a nuthouse,
I gotta shower in a jock strap

17:29.483 --> 17:32.747
and dance class
was the highlight of my week.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.183
You're also gonna get
to spend the rest of your life

17:34.270 --> 17:35.706
with the woman that you love.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.273
And yeah, there's gonna be
some ups and downs

17:37.360 --> 17:41.016
but all in all,
you're one lucky man.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.192
Yeah, I guess you're right.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.628
So strap on your helmet,
cover your nuts

17:44.715 --> 17:46.195
and belly-crawl to the bedroom.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.765
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.158
I really hope so.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.296
[instrumental music]

18:00.383 --> 18:02.777
[laughter]

18:05.214 --> 18:08.130
Hey, honey.
Where'd you go?

18:08.217 --> 18:10.959
Uh, I grabbed a couple
of beers with Carl.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.961
Mom and Victoria
made some Rice Krispie Treats

18:13.048 --> 18:14.484
if you want a little dessert.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.182
Sure.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.532
So, everything's good?

18:18.619 --> 18:20.577
- Everybody's staying?
- Of course.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.101
Where would anybody be going?

18:27.193 --> 18:30.283
Okay. I'm gonna grab one
of those Rice Krispie Treats.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.938
- Have as many as you want.
- You enjoy.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.115
[all laughing]

18:41.468 --> 18:43.209
What the hell kind
of game are they playing?

18:45.733 --> 18:47.082
[instrumental music]

18:52.479 --> 18:53.393
[theme music]
