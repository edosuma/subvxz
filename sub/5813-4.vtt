WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:06.348
On April 21st, 1967,

00:06.507 --> 00:07.787
the hundred-millionth GM vehicle

00:07.925 --> 00:09.893
Rolled off the line
at the plant in Janesville.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.430
Three days later,
another car rolled off that same line.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.849
This 1967 Chevrolet Impala

00:15.015 --> 00:17.268
would turn out to be
the most important object

00:17.434 --> 00:19.482
- in pretty much the whole universe.
- Whoo!

00:19.937 --> 00:20.984
Listen to her purr.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.296
- This is the car you want.
- Oh, yeah?

00:27.444 --> 00:28.696
You... You know something about cars?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.422
My dad taught me everything about cars.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.151
I know it's been a long time.

00:34.284 --> 00:38.039
Dean and I... We've... We've been through
a lot of bad. But this is different.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.128
This is my fault
and I don't know how to fix it.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.167
We need your help, God.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.596
We need to know there's hope.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.607
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.405
Dude, what's up with the shorts?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.616
It's a free bunker.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.206
- Did you find anything?
- Uh...

01:55.240 --> 01:56.537
Not on The Darkness.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.660
No.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.378
What about Metatron?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.381
Still in the wind. No leads.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.587
Great.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.718
So, we have an ancient evil
out there somewhere,

02:06.877 --> 02:09.221
just getting stronger by the day.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.757
Cass is getting better, so there's that.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.643
- Still wants to fix your, uh...
- I’m fine.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.889
Fine. 100%.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.726
All right, well, he's not.
He still needs more time to heal.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.851
Well...  Guess we got nothing
to do but get better.

02:22.017 --> 02:25.567
I don't know about you,
but I've got some serious cabin fever.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.169
I've washed every car in here twice.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.990
Well, I may have found us a case.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.527
- I mean, it's thin...
- Hey, thin works.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.694
Tell me on the way.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.750
Figures.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.885
All right, let's hear it. What do you got?

02:46.333 --> 02:49.758
Okay, uh, Quaker Valley, Oregon,
town outside of Eugene.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.003
Dwayne Markham, the local sheriff,
was found in the woods a couple days ago.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.434
His body was mauled,
so they chalked it up to an animal attack,

02:55.592 --> 02:56.872
- but I'm thinking...
- Werewolf.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.978
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah, you're right. That is thin.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.605
Yeah. Probably nothing, right?

03:00.764 --> 03:01.890
Probably not.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.058
Oregon, here we come.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.281
What is that?

03:20.492 --> 03:21.493
It's a smoothie.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.249
Where's the beer?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.086
Under the smoothies.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.429
Where's the rest of the beer?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.138
- Ooh, it's Cass. We gotta, we gotta...
- Man.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.302
I gotta get this.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.183
Hey, Cass. Everything all right?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.561
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just reading up about

03:43.807 --> 03:45.767
the other cases in the area
that you're headed to.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.228
I haven't found anything yet that matches.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.068
Cass, you've got one job to do
and that's to heal.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.948
- You understand?
- I can help.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.108
Yeah, of course you can, Cass,

03:53.275 --> 03:57.030
but, right now is the time for you
to focus on getting better.

03:57.195 --> 04:01.166
This is just a milk run. We got it.
So, try and relax.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.871
- All right.
- Read a book.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.502
Watch some Netflix.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.164
What's a "Netflix"?

04:08.206 --> 04:11.176
Go to my room, turn on the TV.
You'll figure it out.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.718
All right.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.721
Just call if you need anything.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.348
Got it, Cass. Thanks.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.838
You think he's gonna be okay?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.933
He just needs some time, you know?
We all do.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.860
Are you serious?

04:38.528 --> 04:43.034
Dean, it's late.
I'm exhausted and, and... And starving.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.918
And this place...

04:45.076 --> 04:48.000
I mean, even Swayze
wouldn't come to this Roadhouse.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.712
Okay, first of all,
never use Swayze's name in vain.

04:50.874 --> 04:51.921
Okay? Ever.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.803
Second, you don't
remember this place?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.303
You don't remember Heather?

04:57.088 --> 04:59.136
The hunter that we worked
a Wendigo case a couple years ago?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.051
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.310
What, she's here tonight?

05:02.469 --> 05:06.394
I texted her.
She's working a rugaru case in Texas.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.399
Actually, she never texted me back.
That's not the point.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.437
The point is, is that we have
a ton of driving left to do

05:11.603 --> 05:14.356
just to go to a town
where there's probably not a case.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.152
But in there, good times.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.910
And time heals all wounds, Sam,
especially good times.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.912
What do you say?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.582
I say, knock yourself out.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.613
I'm gonna find a diner,
dig into the lore like Cass did,

05:32.666 --> 05:34.666
see if anything's ever happened
where we're headed.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.798
Oh, man, you really
gotta learn how to have fun.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.547
Seriously, it's pathetic.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.461
Mistakes were made. Mmm-hmm.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.840
Who are you?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.968
- Oh.
- Uh, good morning.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.974
That's, uh, my brother Dean.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.556
Sorry, Sam, I didn't,
I didn't realize you had company.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.687
Yeah. Yeah,
could you give us a minute?

06:27.846 --> 06:28.847
Hi.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.142
Well, I’ll just, uh...
Just won't be here anymore.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.311
So, you kids take your time.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.659
Have you seen my hairpin?

06:50.035 --> 06:52.629
- Dean, I can explain what was going on...
- No, no, no. No.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.513
- Don't Night Moves me.
- Shh.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.473
Just let it wash over you.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.471
- Look...
- Just take it in.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.488
This is ridiculous.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.952
One of the greatest
rock writers of all time, Samuel.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.200
It's Sam.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.927
You started this. You started this.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.223
Here we go. Come on now.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.314
Next time, I choose.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.073
- Hey.
- Hands off the wheel.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.214
You're not even looking at the road.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.743
"Digging into the lore."

08:14.077 --> 08:15.499
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.419
Man, I needed that.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.168
And hey, look at that,
you're finally not a virgin anymore.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.587
But you know what? I think it was time.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.633
I respect the fact that you, uh...

08:25.672 --> 08:28.095
You know, you wanted to stay true
and pure and waited.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.010
Yeah, you know what? You're an idiot.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.057
Even put a blanket down.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.190
Buddy, classy and thoughtful as always.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.851
I tried to give her my number.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.477
You know what she said?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.708
"We got tonight. Who needs tomorrow?"

08:45.692 --> 08:47.660
Is everything a Bob Seger song to you?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.446
Yes.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.754
Well...
It was nice knowing you, Piper.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.456
Piper?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.801
That's awesome.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.300
Heather. One-night wonders, man.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.175
Shoot, we're lucky
we still get that at all.

09:12.886 --> 09:17.062
Really?
You don't ever want something more?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.485
I'm sorry, have you met us?

09:21.061 --> 09:24.486
We're batting a whopping zero
in domestic life, man. Goose eggs.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.071
You don't ever think about something?
Not marriage or whatever.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.867
But, something, you know, with a hunter?
Somebody who understands the life?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.331
Have you not heard a single word
Bob's been singing about?

09:39.621 --> 09:41.544
You're tired. I can tell.
You're exhausted.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.675
Well, I'm still wired,
so I'm gonna pull over, get some gas.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.054
You hop in the back, get some Z's,
'cause, buddy, you earned 'em.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.841
Proud of you! Piper.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.384
Mmm. Man, she smelled good, too.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.366
What are you listening to?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.876
Your mom used to love this song.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.833
Dad?

10:22.205 --> 10:26.210
You okay, pal? You look a little spooked.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.146
It's nice to be back behind the wheel.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.612
Looks like
Dean's taken good care of this old beast.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.074
Seems like
he's taken good care of you, too.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.790
What is this? Another vision?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.371
Are you having visions, son?

10:59.868 --> 11:00.869
Don't call me that.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.836
- What? A father can't call his...
- No, my father is dead.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.752
When has death ever stopped a Winchester?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.801
Look, I don't know what this is, but...

11:12.964 --> 11:16.639
What you said about relationships,
wanting something more...

11:20.680 --> 11:24.856
I never wanted this for you boys,
this life. Not really.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.444
We turned out okay.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.910
You did, didn't you?

11:35.278 --> 11:38.623
But that was on you boys.
You did that, not me.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.248
Well, you played your part.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.374
I did my best, anyway,
for what it was worth.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.918
This isn't real.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.847
I never could fool you, could I?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.354
I prayed when I was in that church.

12:06.309 --> 12:10.234
And I saw something.

12:14.651 --> 12:20.784
And now, here you are, whoever you are,
whatever you are.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.831
What the hell is this?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.495
Dream.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.002
Vision. Call it what you want.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.964
The message is still the same.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.639
The Darkness is coming.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.689
Only you boys can stop it.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.643
Okay, fine.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.560
How?

12:51.521 --> 12:55.321
We need help, not visions of dead people.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.949
God helps those who help themselves.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.452
Who are you?

13:11.082 --> 13:12.880
Welcome to the Winchester Motel.

13:13.918 --> 13:18.890
We don't have cable,
but we do have room service.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.686
You were singing in your sleep.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.100
That song Mom loved,
Dad used to always play for us.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.156
I think I've actually still got the tape.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.397
Hey, Dean, um...

13:36.899 --> 13:40.574
You said when you saw The Darkness,
you weren't sure whether it was, uh...

13:41.904 --> 13:43.702
The real thing or a vision, right?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.534
Mmm-hmm.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.787
I think I've been
having visions, too, lately.

13:49.495 --> 13:53.966
I mean, it's just images.
I mean, more of a feeling, really.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.468
But I just had one right now,

13:58.671 --> 14:01.265
and, and Dad was in it.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.432
But it wasn't Dad like, like,
the Dad that, that I grew up with.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.597
It was Dad when he was our age.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.284
And I guess it wasn't even really Dad.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.072
It was someone pretending to be Dad and...

14:11.100 --> 14:12.602
Okay, what makes you say that?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.147
For starters,
he told me everything I wanted to hear.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.357
- Yeah, doesn't sound like Dad.
- No.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.325
Anyways, whoever it was,

14:20.568 --> 14:24.198
they had a message to deliver.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.825
They said The Darkness is coming.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.001
And only you and I can stop it.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.254
Did they happen to give you
any helpful tips on how to do that?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.794
He said,
"God helps those who help themselves."

14:41.005 --> 14:44.976
I mean, maybe these visions
are coming from God.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.515
Whoa.

14:46.928 --> 14:47.975
Pump the brakes.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.219
I mean, Dean,
the first one happened after I prayed.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.476
You prayed? When was this?

14:55.478 --> 14:56.479
Back in the hospital.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.606
Why?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.028
Because I was infected.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.624
I was infected. I'm not anymore.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.910
And I, I never went full rabid.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.037
You get infected
and you didn't even tell me.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.669
- Dean...
- What did you pray about?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.798
I guess I was just looking for answers,
you know?

15:25.174 --> 15:28.428
Well, I'm sure whatever
is kicking around in your head right now

15:28.594 --> 15:32.690
is a side effect from the infection
that you failed to tell me about.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.022
You know, I don't think it's that simple.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.603
Come on, man. That quote?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.990
"God helps those who help themselves"?
God didn't say that.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.366
That's not even in the Bible.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.904
That's an old proverb
that dates way back to Aesop.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.198
I read.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.204
And more importantly,
when was the last time

15:51.367 --> 15:52.835
God answered any one of our prayers?

15:54.787 --> 15:59.088
It's not a vision, Sam. All right?
It's just some... Some fever dream.

16:00.710 --> 16:01.802
That's all.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.553
And as far as Dad goes,
I dream about Dad all the time.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.593
- You do?
- Of course I do.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.187
It's usually the same one, too.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.897
We're all in the car.
I'm sitting in the driver's seat.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.650
Dad's sitting shotgun.
But there aren't any shotguns.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.167
There's no monsters. There's no hunting.
There's none of that.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.939
It's just...

16:23.274 --> 16:24.571
He's teaching me how to drive.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.239
And, uh... And I'm not little like I was
when he actually taught me how to drive.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.249
I'm 16, and he's helping me
get my learner's permit.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.915
Of course, you're in the backseat,
just begging to take a turn.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.455
We pull up to the house,
the family house.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.459
And I park in the driveway,
and he looks over and he says,

16:42.335 --> 16:43.461
"Perfect landing, son."

16:46.547 --> 16:49.547
I have that dream every couple of months.
It's kind of comforting, actually.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.729
I always, uh...

16:56.516 --> 16:57.608
I always dream about Mom.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.662
Usually the same kind of thing, though.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.737
- Normal life?
- Yeah. Normal life.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.614
But, Dean, this wasn’t just a dream.
I'm telling you.

17:12.365 --> 17:17.121
Why would somebody dress up like Dad
to give you a message?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.454
I mean, Dad.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.544
You don't exactly have a history
of listening to what he had to say.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.175
But you said The Darkness
is sending messages to you.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.384
Maybe whatever is the opposite
of The Darkness is sending messages to me.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.027
And you think that this thing is God?

17:30.341 --> 17:33.345
Come on. How many, how many opportunities
has God had to crack this pinata,

17:33.511 --> 17:34.683
and I don't see
any candy on the floor, do you?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.643
Okay, then maybe it's not God, but...

17:39.725 --> 17:40.817
I know what you're trying to do here.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.238
You're trying to find
some, some greater meaning to it all.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.025
Right? Some fate to what went down.

17:48.401 --> 17:52.247
But I'm telling you, Sam.
The Darkness? It's on us.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.950
And no one's gonna help us,
certainly not God,

17:56.576 --> 18:00.171
so, we'll have to figure this thing out,
like we always do.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.759
But until then, we hunt.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.340
This case, for starters.
Of course, this case is...

18:10.506 --> 18:11.928
Which is probably nothing.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.762
Yeah, probably nothing.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.518
Good night, jerk.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.897
Night, bitch.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.890
Hey, the coroner
showed me the sheriff's body.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.522
And, uh, it was mauled all right.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.980
And get this. Heart missing,
body completely drained of blood.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.067
So, what? We're looking at
a, a werewolf/vampire hybrid?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.565
Say it with me, a Were-pire.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.949
Huh?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.239
No.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.723
- Come on.
- I’m not saying that.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.495
Whatever. I called Cass,
told him to look into the lore.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.659
What do you got?

19:20.326 --> 19:23.580
Right, well, uh, the
sheriff's replacement, Deputy Donnelly...

19:23.746 --> 19:26.295
He's not the brightest bulb,
but I got a copy of his report.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.084
Maybe he missed something.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.251
Agents-.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.091
Deputy.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.755
This must be your partner.

19:32.922 --> 19:33.969
Agent Walsh, right?

19:34.590 --> 19:35.637
Pleasure to meet you.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.053
I just want to thank you
both for stoppin' by.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.937
We really appreciate your due diligence.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.521
Oh. Actually, uh, do you know a motel
where we can crash for the night?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.184
You're stayin'?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.611
Yeah, just wanna kick all the tires.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.483
Well, uh, there's a motel on Downey
that'll give you a good price.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.943
And if you're looking for a decent meal,

19:54.110 --> 19:57.114
you can't beat Aunt Mel's,
down by the train station.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.954
Parking is a bitch, but it's the best
damn steak in the whole state.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.827
You had me at "steak."

20:05.621 --> 20:07.294
All right.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.091
Now we're cookin' with gas.

20:10.793 --> 20:11.885
Valet?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.300
You... What?

20:15.131 --> 20:17.725
Dean,
people valet park all the time.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.593
Come on, live a little.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.683
Welcome to Aunt Mel's.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.397
- Home of the...
- Yeah, listen,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.938
Jessie, not a scratch, okay?

20:53.002 --> 20:54.845
Spider caught a fly.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.679
I repeat, spider caught a fly.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.179
- Let's go! Come on!
- Okay!

21:04.138 --> 21:06.482
Hell, yeah. Let's roll!

21:06.849 --> 21:09.022
Let's get this party started.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.239
Oh, my God!

21:35.002 --> 21:37.300
Yes, sir? We're on our way.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.223
My way.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.385
What did you do?

21:44.428 --> 21:45.930
I'm gonna get fired.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.307
- Come on!
- Okay!

21:49.141 --> 21:51.394
- I gotta go. Let's go!
- Where's my purse?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.903
You probably just left it in your car.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.485
- What?
- I gotta go! I don't wanna get fired!

22:19.505 --> 22:22.258
Strong work, Jessie. Strong work.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.510
Thanks.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.436
So, what's next?

22:30.516 --> 22:32.610
I want, uh,
to talk to the sheriff's widow.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.107
Lily Markham.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.446
Maybe she knows something
about why her husband

22:39.608 --> 22:40.825
was out in the woods in the first place.

22:40.985 --> 22:41.986
All right, well, I'll drop you off.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.654
I wanna go back to the woods
where they found the body.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.983
Something wasn't right
about those crime scene photos.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.137
- Cass, you okay?
- I'm mostly confused.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.308
I'm not sure how orange
correlates with black in a way that's new.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.895
Step away from the Netflix.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.357
- Sorry.
- It's okay. We've all had a binge.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.941
You find anything in the lore?

23:17.104 --> 23:20.324
Well, there is a creature
that feeds on hearts and blood.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.950
A Were-pire, you might say?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.861
Come on, I know you wanna say it.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.291
In the lore,
it's referred to as a Whisper.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.542
That's lame.

23:30.701 --> 23:34.001
Silver will kill it, but you may
want to decapitate it just to be sure.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.165
All right, sounds good.
I'm at the crime scene now.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.211
It was staged. The body was dragged.
There were no signs of struggle.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.012
Body was moved there
to look more like an animal attack?

23:42.171 --> 23:44.173
Yeah, maybe. It was pretty sloppy, though.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.762
You, uh...

23:45.966 --> 23:47.326
What else you got on these things?

23:47.509 --> 23:49.182
Listen to this.
Whispers have a fascinating history...

23:49.345 --> 23:50.392
Hang on.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.525
Actually, they were once believed
to be in the bloodline of werewolves,

23:54.683 --> 23:56.481
but in fact,
they are more similar to demons.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.362
Deputy? What's going on?

23:58.520 --> 24:02.741
They, uh... They got their
nickname from how quiet their attacks are.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.569
Because of their stealthiness...

24:04.735 --> 24:07.204
...they've, uh, lived
on the fringes for centuries.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.572
Although, there were several

24:08.739 --> 24:11.037
that were hunted and killed
during the Salem witch...

24:11.325 --> 24:13.248
Wait a minute. Okay, according to this,

24:13.410 --> 24:15.879
Whispers only feed during a solar eclipse.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.708
Uh, so, Dean, I... I don't believe

24:18.916 --> 24:20.543
what you're hunting is a Whisper.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.990
Must be another creature of some kind.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.218
Okay. Fine, I'll say it.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.467
Maybe it is your so-called Were-pire.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.096
But to be honest, I have
never heard of a creature with that name.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.106
Dean, what is that?

24:35.099 --> 24:36.100
Dean?

24:42.064 --> 24:45.068
Dean. Dean, are you all right?
I hear gunshots.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.410
Dean!

24:49.488 --> 24:50.489
Dean?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.159
Dean!

24:58.789 --> 25:01.042
Ah, turns out I did shoot the deputy.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.089
- Wait, Dean, is, is everything...
- The deputy was a Were-pire.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.380
It's all right.

25:07.548 --> 25:08.765
Silver bullets worked.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.301
No, Dean, listen.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.765
According to the lore, the timing is off.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.731
The next solar eclipse in North America
is years away.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.061
- It can't be a...
- Hang on.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.192
Dean, wait.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.779
This thing couldn't be...

25:24.773 --> 25:25.774
Dean?

25:34.783 --> 25:35.784
Scratch that.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.544
You gotta cut off their...

25:44.168 --> 25:45.966
Dean, it's not a Whisper.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.969
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.138
Give me a sec.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.103
All right.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.154
All right, that...

26:52.361 --> 26:53.362
Okay.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.333
Smile, asshat.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.888
- All right, Cass, you there?
- Of course. What's going on?

27:13.006 --> 27:14.929
Well, whatever it is,
silver slows it down.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.848
I, uh... I'm sending you a picture
right now of its fangs.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.333
I've never seen anything like it.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.190
See if there's a match in the lore,
would you?

27:23.559 --> 27:24.731
I'm on it.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.745
Dean, I got jumped.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.747
- You okay?
- I think, for now.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.408
Pretty sure
we're dealing with a pack here.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.215
Uh, two of these things were
attacking Mrs. Markham when I arrived.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.671
I, I filled them with silver,
but it only slowed them down.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.086
Yeah, well,
Deputy Dumbass is one of them as well.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.128
He's, uh...
He's in two pieces and still alive.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.712
Where you at now?

27:51.962 --> 27:54.431
Mrs. Markham was knocked out.
I carried her to a house nearby.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.630
- Here, I'll text you the address now.
- All right, sit tight. I'm on my way.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.770
Buddy's gettin' jumped.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.788
Door was open
when I got to the house.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.128
By the time I searched through it,
they'd already beaten her unconscious.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.292
Maybe she knew something

28:30.542 --> 28:31.794
or something about
what happened to her husband.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.759
So what, they tried to take her out
while the deputy went back to the scene?

28:35.005 --> 28:36.803
Yeah, he went to fix it up. Found me.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.969
Hey, Cass, tell me you got something

28:41.220 --> 28:43.814
that doesn't involve chicks in prison.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.064
Bet you never thought
you'd say that out loud.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.855
It's a Nachzehrer.

28:48.602 --> 28:51.856
- Come again?
- A ghoul and vampire-like creature.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.274
A Ghoul-pire! Right?

28:55.692 --> 28:57.372
Some breeds feed on the flesh of the dead.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.487
Others feed
on the blood and hearts of the living.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.413
They run in small packs, but they usually
keep an extremely low profile.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.775
Great. So, how do we kill 'em?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.266
Well, they're already dead.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.370
So in a manner of speaking, they just
need to be reminded that they're dead.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.009
- You need a Charon's obol.
- Of course.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.007
Yeah, in ancient Greece,
when a person died,

29:15.170 --> 29:18.014
some people believed you had to
put an obol, or a coin in their mouth,

29:18.173 --> 29:21.848
so they could use it as currency to be
taken across the river to the underworld.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.417
Right, you place a coin
in a Nachzehrer's mouth,

29:24.513 --> 29:26.561
then sever their head,
and that will kill them.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.396
And according to the lore,
if you kill the pack's Alpha,

29:28.558 --> 29:31.027
everyone they've turned
will revert back to human form.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.234
Awesome. All right,
where do we find an obol?

29:33.647 --> 29:35.320
Well, according
to the Men of Letters' records,

29:35.482 --> 29:37.075
you're gonna need a copper coin.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.036
They used to use pennies,
so, you'll need one of those.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.910
Yeah, but one minted pre-1982.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.952
So before 1982, pennies were 95% copper.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.839
Since then,
they're only copper-plated zinc.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.992
Wow. Your nerdiness knows no bounds.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.467
- You're welcome.
- All right, well, thanks, Cass.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.753
Good work. Way to come off the bench.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.004
What bench?

29:57.254 --> 29:59.382
Just get back to getting better, okay?

30:01.800 --> 30:02.801
Got nothing.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.937
Well, yeah, I mean,
who carries pennies these days, anyway?

30:13.020 --> 30:14.442
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.734
Mrs. Markham?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.403
Mrs. Markham. It's okay.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.787
I'm Dean Winchester.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.493
- My brother Sam and...
- Where am I?

30:26.742 --> 30:29.746
You were attacked by the same people
that killed your husband.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.414
My husband.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.882
Now do you know something
about what happened to him?

30:35.042 --> 30:36.722
Maybe that's why
these people attacked you?

30:39.504 --> 30:40.505
Okay.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.849
Well, we're gonna take you someplace safe,
all right?

30:43.008 --> 30:44.888
And then we're gonna
kill these sons of bitches.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I could, uh...
I could explain that.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.943
Well, maybe not.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.400
Um, it's like the thing
that attacked you, okay?

30:59.566 --> 31:00.943
It's a Ghoul-pire.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.862
The point is, it can't hurt you anymore.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.468
At least, I don't think it can. It's...

31:05.489 --> 31:07.241
You know what? Let's just get rid of it.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.124
Here we go.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.102
Okay, all right. See? There we go.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.930
- You okay?
- Your family.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.646
You do anything for them, don't you?

31:36.353 --> 31:37.354
Absolutely.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.157
Yeah, but not if it costs too much.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.779
No.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.203
You do everything for them.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.198
Everything else is meaningless.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.288
But I did it wrong.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.496
Now I've ruined everything.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.295
This isn't your fault.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.836
I put my family at risk.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.180
They were right to attack me.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.519
But I know how to make it right.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.107
Where is it?
What did you do with the maker's body?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.315
You're gonna tell me or I will end you!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.488
See? That wasn't so hard.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.903
Now, I know what to do with you.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.617
I can make this right

33:14.784 --> 33:16.752
I can make this right

33:17.746 --> 33:18.747
I can make this right

33:21.625 --> 33:22.842
You're okay!

33:23.418 --> 33:26.592
See? I fixed it. You're okay.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.653
I know you're awake.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.989
I know you're a hunter.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.327
And I know you're a Nachzehrer.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.753
The maker, right? The pack Alpha?

33:59.162 --> 34:01.540
Well, maybe you're not
as dumb as you look.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.630
Thought you and yours
like to keep a low profile.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.467
Sadly, rookies like Lily here
aren't up to snuff

34:08.630 --> 34:11.179
when it comes to
keeping their feeding quiet.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.972
So, you killed your husband?

34:13.342 --> 34:14.344
He wouldn't join us.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.476
People who don't join are food.

34:21.768 --> 34:25.489
But, I... I messed up,
and I..- I didn't bury him right.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.152
It's my fault, really.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.367
You weren't properly trained.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.326
But everyone
deserves a mulligan, don't they?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.951
That's all my people
were trying to do, Lily.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.994
They weren't going to kill you.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.583
Hell, I need you.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.507
I need all the help I can get.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.007
How many have you turned?

34:46.333 --> 34:49.007
In the first 100 years? Three.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.804
In the last month? Sixteen.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.974
What, are you trying
to field a baseball team?

34:55.010 --> 34:59.766
It's like I said, I need help,
every strong hand I can find.

35:02.183 --> 35:07.906
And I need an army to fight The Darkness.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.241
Oh, it's comin', for all of us.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.832
There's nothing hunters
or any human can do about it.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.744
Do you know how to stop it?

35:21.661 --> 35:23.629
I don't think anything can stop it.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.335
I'm just tryin' to buy some time,

35:28.501 --> 35:32.301
so I'm turning
as many strong men and women as I can.

35:33.590 --> 35:37.060
Your brother will make a fine addition
to the rank and file.

35:39.012 --> 35:43.267
While you slept,
I sent him a text message from your phone.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.567
Oh, he's heading into a trap right now.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.695
You'd make a good soldier, too.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.663
But you cut off my head,
and I can't stand for that.

35:57.906 --> 35:58.907
Don't worry.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.586
I'm an "every part
of the buffalo" kind of guy.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.044
Your death won't go to waste.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.418
You'll be your brother's first meal.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.896
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.616
Oh, my God. What have I...

38:46.282 --> 38:47.283
My kids.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.454
My kids. They turned my kids.
They're with the others.

38:50.912 --> 38:51.913
Please.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.547
Sam.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.417
Yeah, yeah.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.650
Come on. Come on. Come on.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.032
Come on, baby. Yeah! There we go.

39:28.658 --> 39:29.659
Ah.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.254
Hang on.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.752
Mom!

40:15.538 --> 40:18.087
- You okay?
- Probably nothing, right?

40:21.169 --> 40:23.217
- Everybody all right back there?
- Uh, yeah.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.847
They all changed back.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.722
So, it was Deputy Dumbass, huh?

40:29.010 --> 40:32.139
Yeah, Deputy Dumbass.
You know, he was trying to build an army.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.937
Yeah, I know. To fight The Darkness.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.894
Dean, even the monsters are scared.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.103
Well, let 'em be.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.317
You and I, we're gonna end this thing now.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.871
You, you mind starting tomorrow?

40:49.364 --> 40:52.163
- Deal.
- Deal.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.747
We'll get Cass to fix you up.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.208
Only if he fixes you up, too.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.881
Okay, Mom.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.375
Let's go home.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.841
You know what? We are home.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.098
Come on. Come on.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.893
Ah.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.181
There's my girl.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.084
