A BATH WON'T HELP HIM!

- BUT YOU SAID--

09:29.402 --> 09:32.321
- I KNOW, BUT I WAS JUST JOKING.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.406
- JOKING?

09:33.489 --> 09:36.200
- BATHS DON'T REALLY
CURE CRANKINESS.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.452
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
A WEIRD SENSE OF HUMOR.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.163

THAT CLEARS A LOT UP.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.456

UM, WHY AREN'T WE DOOMED YET?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.235

10:11.319 --> 10:12.653
ACCORDING TO COVERTON,

10:12.737 --> 10:13.612
WE SHOULD BE SUFFERING
UNIMAGINABLE PAIN

10:13.696 --> 10:16.949
INSIDE A PSIONIC FIRESTORM
BY NOW.

DO THE SOUNDS...

10:57.907 --> 11:00.326

11:00.409 --> 11:02.912

COVERTON'S A BIG, STINKY LIAR.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.748
ABOUT BATHS
CURING CRANKINESS, SUSAN.

COVERTON IS?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.418
HIS FROWN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.849

11:49.375 --> 11:50.459
- DIANE?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.627
- B.O.B.'S GIRLFRIEND!

11:51.710 --> 11:53.671
- WHAT?
NO, I CHECKED.

11:53.754 --> 11:57.091
B.O.B.'S GIRLFRIEND DIANE

11:58.467 --> 12:00.136
[groans and spits]

12:00.219 --> 12:02.012
B.O.B. WILL BE CRUSHED
WHEN HE FINDS OUT I ATE--

WELL, ACTUALLY,
HE'LL BE CONFUSED,

12:03.431 --> 12:04.849
CAUSE, LET'S FACE IT,

BUT THEN,
WHEN HE FINALLY GETS IT--

12:07.226 --> 12:08.477
CRUSHED!
WHAT DO I DO?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.438
- I COULD DROP THE BRAIN
OF A CAPUCHIN MONKEY

12:10.521 --> 12:12.064
INTO THE SKULL OF A WOMBAT.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.357

12:13.441 --> 12:16.485

12:16.569 --> 12:18.154
BUT IT IS SOMETHING I COULD DO,

12:18.237 --> 12:19.864
SO I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE NOTED.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.116

HOW TO DO THAT.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.206
SUZE, HELP ME MAKE
A NEW DIANE!

12:34.044 --> 12:34.753
BUT YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IN THE LONG RUN.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.715

17:57.618 --> 18:00.370
[both screaming]

18:02.664 --> 18:04.625
- NOW WE WAIT
FOR THE GELATIN TO SET.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.126
- WAIT?
HA!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.629
WHO NEEDS TO WAIT WHEN
WE HAVE MAD--

18:08.712 --> 18:10.798
- DR. COCKROACH,

18:10.881 --> 18:12.007
I GO GINORMIC!

18:12.090 --> 18:13.091

18:13.175 --> 18:16.178
- VERY CLEAR.
IXNAY ON ADMAY IENCESAY.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.722
CLEAR AS ICE.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.097
OR IS IT?

18:24.394 --> 18:24.853
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.647
- DOUBT IT.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.856
- A MONKEY-BRAINED WOMBAT

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
COULD TUNNEL THROUGH THIS
AND GET HELP.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.652
SHAME NOBODY LISTENED
TO ME EARLIER.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.532
- AW, LINK, I GOT IT.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.034
WE JUST BECOME
PUDDLES AND HIDE!

18:39.117 --> 18:41.662
- UM, B.O.B.,
I CAN'T BECOME A PUDDLE.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.330
- NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE,
YOU CAN'T!

18:43.413 --> 18:45.332
COME ON BUDDY, JUST PUT
A LITTLE EFFORT INTO IT!

18:45.415 --> 18:46.583
- B.O.B., SERIOUSLY!

18:46.667 --> 18:48.210
IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!

18:48.293 --> 18:49.795
I CANNOT BECOME A PUDDLE!

18:49.878 --> 18:50.879
- STRANGE.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.881
YOU NEVER MENTIONED THIS BEFORE.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.925
I WONDER WHAT OTHER SECRETS
YOU'RE KEEPING FROM ME.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.386
- WELL, OKAY,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT...

18:57.469 --> 18:58.679
- [screeching roar]

18:58.762 --> 18:59.888
- WE'LL TALK LATER!
- YEAH!

18:59.972 --> 19:00.889
- [roars]

19:00.973 --> 19:04.393
[both screaming]

19:04.476 --> 19:05.269
- [gasps]

19:09.481 --> 19:11.900
- B.O.B., BUDDY,
THIS IS THE END,

19:11.984 --> 19:13.735
SO I'VE GOT
A FEW THINGS TO SAY.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.238
- [roars]

19:16.321 --> 19:18.240
LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN
A TIGHT PAL, B.O.B.,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.743
THE BEST THIS
PREHISTORIC FISH-MAN EVER HAD,

19:21.827 --> 19:24.371
AND THAT'S WHY I NEED
TO COME CLEAN ABOUT DIANE.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.915
- DIANE!
- YEAH, DIANE.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.791
I ATE--
- NO, DIANE'S PART PINEAPPLE!

19:27.875 --> 19:30.419
HEY, I BET IF I TELL THIS GUY--

19:30.502 --> 19:31.503
- NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S--

19:31.587 --> 19:33.881
- HEY, GUY, CRAZY COINCIDENCE.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.383
YOU'RE A PINEAPPLE,
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW A--

19:36.466 --> 19:37.384
- [chomps]

19:37.467 --> 19:38.385

19:38.468 --> 19:39.219
NO!

19:41.096 --> 19:42.514
SO YOU'RE GONNA EAT ME?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.433
GO ON.
I DON'T CARE.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.851
I DESERVE IT.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.519
- [burps]
HUH?

19:47.603 --> 19:50.647
- I ATE MY BEST BUDDY'S
GELATIN GIRLFRIEND,

19:50.731 --> 19:51.523
AND THEN HE GOT EATEN!

19:51.607 --> 19:54.109
AND NOW I'M GONNA GET EATEN!

19:54.192 --> 19:54.902
I THINK THERE'S
SOME POETIC JUSTICE

19:54.985 --> 19:57.029
IN THERE SOMEWHERE MAYBE.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.447
- [rumbles]

19:58.530 --> 20:03.076
- ANYWAY, THE WORST PART IS,
I NEVER EVEN TOLD HIM

20:03.160 --> 20:04.244
HOW SORRY I WAS.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.622
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I NEVER MEANT TO--

20:06.705 --> 20:09.082
- [rumbles]

20:09.166 --> 20:10.208
- UH...

20:10.292 --> 20:12.127
SO ARE YOU GONNA
DO THIS OR--

20:12.211 --> 20:13.420
[grunts]

20:13.503 --> 20:14.546
- [rumbles]

20:14.630 --> 20:16.381
[screeches]

20:16.465 --> 20:17.215
boom!

20:20.719 --> 20:22.512
- AW, B.O.B.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.263
- YEAH?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.474
- B.O.B., YOU'RE ALIVE!

20:25.557 --> 20:28.352
- YEAH, I GUESS I DON'T
DIGEST VERY WELL.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.771
- SO YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING

20:30.854 --> 20:32.814
THAT MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED
A LITTLE LIKE A CONFESSION?

20:32.898 --> 20:33.732
- LIKE A WHAT--

20:33.815 --> 20:35.901
WHOA, LINK, LOOK AT ME!

20:35.984 --> 20:37.486
I LOOK JUST LIKE DIANE!

20:37.569 --> 20:38.737
- YEAH, DIANE.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.488
SEE, WHAT I--

20:39.571 --> 20:40.155
WHOA!

20:40.238 --> 20:42.157
I GOT TO SHOW HER THIS.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.119
- KNOW WHAT?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.829
LOOKS GOOD.
- AGREED.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.706
B.O.B. WILL NEVER KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.999
- DIANE!
DIANE!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.669
WHERE'S DIANE?

20:53.752 --> 20:54.753
OH, THERE!

20:54.836 --> 20:55.837
CHECK ME OUT!

20:55.921 --> 20:57.756
PINEAPPLE CHUNKS!

20:57.839 --> 20:59.132
WE'RE TWINSIES!

20:59.216 --> 21:00.175
- HE'S BUYING IT!

21:00.259 --> 21:01.343
- THANK GOODNESS.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.928
- THE GREAT
GELATIN ROMANCE CONTINUES.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.013
- OH, AND I ALMOST FORGOT.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.224
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.350
all:
WHAT?

21:08.433 --> 21:09.935
- GUYS, PLEASE.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.436
KIND OF A PRIVATE MOMENT.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.771
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU EARLIER,

21:12.854 --> 21:14.022
BUT LINK HAD THIS
REALLY, REALLY COOL THING

21:14.106 --> 21:15.941
HE NEEDED TO SHOW ME.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.777
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.153
I THINK
WE'VE BOTH KNOWN FOR A WHILE

21:20.237 --> 21:21.530
THIS WASN'T WORKING.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.615
PLUS, I'VE MET SOMEONE.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.327
SHE'S A BANANA PUDDING CUP.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.704
I HOPE WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.038
COME ON, EVELYN.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.498
YOU GOT TO SEE THIS ROCK.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.500
IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.753
- SO WE WENT THROUGH
ALL THAT FOR NOTHING?

21:36.837 --> 21:37.713
- I GUESS.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.298
OH, WELL.
ANYBODY WANT SOME--

21:40.382 --> 21:42.426
- [slurping]

21:43.844 --> 21:45.595
WHAT?
