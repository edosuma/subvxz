00:01.434 --> 00:11.077
.

00:11.077 --> 00:14.547
...a bit. Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr,
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.547 --> 00:17.250
the show that brings you
stories from history...

00:17.250 --> 00:19.519
We will fight them in Starbucks!

00:19.519 --> 00:23.623
...as told by blind-drunk comedians.
(indistinct noises)

00:23.623 --> 00:27.594
So, get out your books while our
comedians get out their skulls.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.230
I'm sure
there's nothing sinister going on.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.166
Victory in spite of all... (gibbers)

00:33.166 --> 00:36.703
Let everybody die.
It's perfect for Hitler.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.205
(both grunt)

00:39.205 --> 00:42.375
I'm a comedian.
Come and see me live. (snorts)

00:53.486 --> 00:56.389
First we have a story
about Winston Churchill.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.892
Churchill couldn't have been
more British.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.362
He looked like the love child
of Queen Victoria and a bulldog.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.930
I've been asked to point out

01:03.930 --> 01:06.666
that Queen Victoria
has never fucked a bulldog.

01:06.666 --> 01:11.404
Matt Richardson had a whopping 13
double gin and tonics for this one.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.674
Stand by for possibly
our biggest pisshead yet.

01:14.674 --> 01:19.412
So, this is the story
of a man called Winston Churchill

01:19.412 --> 01:24.284
who was the only man
in the UK parliament

01:24.284 --> 01:28.555
who decided that standing up
to Adolf Hitler was a good idea.

01:29.722 --> 01:34.227
So World War I happened.
You know, World War I is horrific.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.730
We settle into a point
where we're recovering from the war,

01:37.730 --> 01:40.867
it's all good, we've got
a Prime Minister that we like.

01:40.867 --> 01:44.237
He's called Neville Chamberlain.
He's having a great time.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.239
He's having a good shot at it,

01:46.239 --> 01:50.276
but things are kicking off in
Germany. The Nazis are happening.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.480
And Chamberlain goes,
"Hey, guys, guys, guys."

01:53.480 --> 01:56.015
"Let's just let them get on
with it, yeah?"

01:56.015 --> 02:00.153
"We've got our own shit going on.
No-one wants a fucking war."

02:00.153 --> 02:03.590
"Who wants a war? Who wants a war?"

02:03.590 --> 02:05.758
"No-one wants a war."

02:05.758 --> 02:08.761
"Hitler, I promise you,
hand on my heart..."

02:09.996 --> 02:12.765
"...is gonna be not a problem, OK?"

02:12.765 --> 02:14.534
The only person who's going,

02:14.534 --> 02:19.239
"Mate, right,
the Nazis are fucking dickheads",

02:19.239 --> 02:22.976
is a bloke called Winston Churchill
who is, you know...

02:22.976 --> 02:27.080
He's an MP in the Conservative party,
but he is the only person

02:27.080 --> 02:30.283
that is worried about
what is gonna happen in the future.

02:30.283 --> 02:34.787
"Trust me... trust me, dudes,
he's gonna be a fucking knob end."

02:34.787 --> 02:39.526
"I want you to go in and absolutely
ram them in the bum hole."

02:39.526 --> 02:44.797
"In war terms.
And that's when we'll be safe."

02:44.797 --> 02:49.636
Chamberlain and his MPs
ig-ignored Churchill

02:49.636 --> 02:54.173
and they went back to shagging pigs
cos they're MPs.

02:54.173 --> 02:59.612
The only people that thought he was
an actual influential player in this

02:59.612 --> 03:04.651
was the German government
and Adolf Hitler. All right?

03:05.885 --> 03:11.024
Hitler, he goes, "I need you
to invite him to Europe."

03:11.024 --> 03:13.593
"You need to get him to our country
in Germany

03:14.627 --> 03:19.832
and that will be enough
to let England

03:19.832 --> 03:23.436
show us a clear path

03:23.436 --> 03:27.507
to do whatever invasions we want,
OK?"

03:27.507 --> 03:30.209
"OK? That's what's going to happen."

03:32.478 --> 03:34.747
So they write a few letters
to Churchill.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.283
Churchill opens the letter,
and it goes,

03:37.283 --> 03:42.956
"Ze grand Fuhrer of Germany,
Adolf Hitler,

03:42.956 --> 03:48.394
invites you on a Ryanair flight
from Stansted Airport

03:48.394 --> 03:50.229
to come to Germany

03:50.229 --> 03:53.800
to prove that we are more than worthy

03:53.800 --> 03:57.236
of your approval and cooperation."

03:57.236 --> 03:59.572
"Please come
and have dinner with us."

03:59.572 --> 04:01.040
Right?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.242
And Winston goes, "Dear Mr Hitler,

04:03.242 --> 04:09.315
I would rather suck off my dad
than come and work with you."

04:09.315 --> 04:12.752
"Regards, Winston Churchill."

04:12.752 --> 04:15.388
So Hitler, hearing this news...

04:16.723 --> 04:19.759
He was so fucking angry

04:19.759 --> 04:25.198
and his face went so red
that his moustache flew right off.

04:29.469 --> 04:35.308
Even though Hitler, right,
was fuming,

04:35.308 --> 04:40.913
he sent his ambassador,
Joachim von Ribbentrop, to the UK.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.216
Ribbentrop and Churchill

04:43.216 --> 04:47.253
meet on 21st May 19...

04:47.253 --> 04:48.955
(groans)

04:51.157 --> 04:54.727
Basically Ribbentrop goes,
"Look, Winston,

04:54.727 --> 04:57.196
we know you're important, right,

04:57.196 --> 05:01.134
but I'm Joseph von
fucking Ribbentrop, right?"

05:01.134 --> 05:06.305
"Basically, if you let us invade
here, here and here,

05:06.305 --> 05:09.776
we will leave
the British Empire alone."

05:09.776 --> 05:13.079
"You can... that's yours,
you can have the British Empire,

05:13.079 --> 05:15.481
but we want these places."

05:15.481 --> 05:18.584
And Churchill went,
"You know what, mate? No."

05:18.584 --> 05:20.520
"No.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.854
"No."

05:22.889 --> 05:26.225
Von Ribbentrop went,
"Well, you know what means, then."

05:26.225 --> 05:30.863
"You don't want that to happen.
This inevitably means war."

05:31.964 --> 05:36.235
And Churchill went, "You know what,
mate? You know what, right?"

05:36.235 --> 05:40.073
"Bring it the fuck in,

05:40.073 --> 05:43.676
because we are prepared
for a fucking war."

05:48.614 --> 05:51.551
So, Van Ribbentrop
went back to Hitler.

05:51.551 --> 05:55.254
He goes, "They're not gonna let us
invade where we wanna invade."

05:56.355 --> 06:00.226
And Hitler went, "No, no,
this is what is happening."

06:00.226 --> 06:03.863
"I am invading
whenever I want to invade."

06:03.863 --> 06:08.367
"I will make him look like
he is a fucking loser."

06:08.367 --> 06:11.704
"I am Hitler. OK?"

06:11.704 --> 06:14.040
"OK? Good."

06:14.040 --> 06:16.042
Hitler, at any opportunity he got,

06:16.042 --> 06:19.912
would slander Churchill's name
in the press, in the media,

06:19.912 --> 06:23.349
in any possible medium he could.

06:23.349 --> 06:27.887
"Winston Churchill
is a fucking liar!"

06:27.887 --> 06:31.491
"Churchill is a fuck warmonger!"

06:31.491 --> 06:35.161
"Churchill is a fuck pig!"

06:35.161 --> 06:37.597
Hitler was an angry man!

06:37.597 --> 06:42.201
He said loads of things
that didn't really mean anything.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.903
So.

06:43.903 --> 06:48.574
On 1st September 1939,
the Germa...

06:48.574 --> 06:50.376
(laughs)

06:51.544 --> 06:53.613
So the Germil...

06:53.613 --> 06:55.114
(laughs)

06:56.149 --> 06:58.384
So, the Germ hill...

06:58.384 --> 06:59.685
(laughs)

07:02.188 --> 07:05.291
So, the Germans inpaid...

07:05.291 --> 07:06.926
(laughs)

07:11.464 --> 07:15.201
So, the Germans invade Poland,

07:15.201 --> 07:17.770
and it proves Churchill right

07:17.770 --> 07:21.307
that they are a bunch
of absolute bastards.

07:21.307 --> 07:27.079
On 1st September 1939,
World War II begins.

07:27.079 --> 07:32.084
So having lost faith and having
lost face, Chamberlain resigned

07:32.084 --> 07:35.188
and was swiftly replaced with,
guess who.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.056
Oh... (gibbers)

07:37.056 --> 07:39.158
Fucking Neville Churcherville.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.696
He's not really called Neville,
but Churchill.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.465
Of course.

07:46.465 --> 07:49.335
The cabinet,
they're sceptical about the fact

07:49.335 --> 07:53.039
he wants to defend our whole country
against the Nazis,

07:53.039 --> 07:56.008
so what he does, is he does a speech.

07:56.008 --> 08:01.614
Churchill stands there
and he goes, "Victory at all costs."

08:01.614 --> 08:06.185
"Victory in spite of all terror,
victory in spite of all...."

08:06.185 --> 08:07.753
(gibbers)

08:07.753 --> 08:08.955
(applause)

08:08.955 --> 08:13.559
Which the other MPs
go absolutely fucking mental for.

08:13.559 --> 08:17.396
They're stood round going,
"This guy, right?"

08:17.396 --> 08:19.131
"This guy is our guy."

08:19.131 --> 08:23.970
"This is the one that's gonna lead us
to fucking victory."

08:25.304 --> 08:29.609
Meanwhile, Hitler starts his
offensive on the Western Front

08:29.609 --> 08:30.843
that day.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.246
He loves it.
He's going all over the place.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.248
He's going, "Shoot that person."

08:35.248 --> 08:38.183
"Kill that person.
Invade that country."

08:38.183 --> 08:41.787
"Just let everybody die.
It's perfect for Hitler."

08:45.925 --> 08:49.028
Churchill, he's won over
the House of Commons.

08:49.028 --> 08:53.532
He still needs to convince
the British public to go to war.

08:53.532 --> 08:56.836
They're not interested.
They're going, "Oi, Churchill,

08:56.836 --> 08:59.272
I don't want to bury
my second husband,

08:59.272 --> 09:03.509
because in the last war,
he got put in the ground, yeah?"

09:03.509 --> 09:09.448
"So please, no war. That'd be
amazing for us lot, all right?"

09:10.349 --> 09:12.485
And this is what he does, right.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.321
He now does what is known

09:15.321 --> 09:21.360
as one of the most British
and most famous speeches of all time,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.329
to the British public.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.264
And he says,

09:25.264 --> 09:28.768
"We will fight them on the beaches."

09:28.768 --> 09:30.536
(gibbers)

09:30.536 --> 09:34.273
"We will fight them in France."
(gibbers)

09:34.273 --> 09:37.877
"We will fight them in Starbucks."
(gibbers)

09:37.877 --> 09:40.546
"We will fight them on the beaches!"

09:40.546 --> 09:42.348
"We will fight them in Lidl."

09:42.348 --> 09:47.687
"We will fight them
in any means possible to make sure

09:47.687 --> 09:52.992
that the German people
fight in their streets

09:52.992 --> 09:54.894
and we will fight in ours."

09:54.894 --> 09:56.896
"We will defend our island,

09:56.896 --> 10:01.767
and we will make sure
we win the war."

10:01.767 --> 10:03.269
(applause)

10:03.269 --> 10:05.104
And do you know what?

10:05.104 --> 10:11.043
The British people fucking loved it.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.146
So, the British went to war.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.984
We kicked the fucking shit
out of the Nazis.

10:17.984 --> 10:21.687
We are fucking legends!

10:23.956 --> 10:25.291
Chink.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.996
Hitler only had
one functional testicle,

10:29.996 --> 10:31.364
which beats the number

10:31.364 --> 10:34.667
of functioning livers
Matt Richardson now has by one.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.136
We'll be back after a quick break.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.007
Join us then for Olivia Colman with
a tash. Take that, Broadchurch.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.643
You are making a mockery
of homoeopathy.

10:47.013 --> 10:47.213
.

10:49.715 --> 10:49.915
.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.985
Welcome back to Drunk History,

10:52.985 --> 10:57.156
a show where comedians let their
hair down and their families down.

10:57.156 --> 11:01.560
I would rather suck off my dad.
All right?

11:03.295 --> 11:06.132
Now it's time to find out
about Dr Hawley Crippen.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.368
If you're wondering who
wasted his wife, well, it was him.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.504
If you wonder
what wasted Josie Long,

11:11.504 --> 11:14.640
it was two Aperol Spritz,
two Campari and oranges,

11:14.640 --> 11:17.076
four rum and cokes
and three rum and gingers.

11:18.644 --> 11:22.214
Good evening. This is Drunk History.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.816
(laughs)

11:23.816 --> 11:28.187
This is the story
of Dr Hawley Crippen..

11:29.355 --> 11:33.125
...who was the world's
first international fugitive

11:33.125 --> 11:36.529
and also a idiot criminal.

11:38.264 --> 11:42.068
Dr Hawley Crippen is a homoeopath,

11:42.068 --> 11:44.603
which, as we all know,
is not a real doctor.

11:45.671 --> 11:49.175
People come to him and he's like,
"Oh, what's wrong with you?"

11:49.175 --> 11:51.544
"Have you dislocated your shoulder?"

11:51.544 --> 11:55.081
"Here's some sugar pills.
That'll probably sort it out."

11:55.081 --> 11:59.085
He's like a placebo dispenser,
wearing a white jacket.

11:59.085 --> 12:03.089
And his wife wants to be a music hall
singer, but they're very unhappy.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.957
They're from different planets.

12:04.957 --> 12:08.694
He is from the fake medicine planet,
she is from the musical...

12:08.694 --> 12:12.565
Pardon me.
So he's in his doctor's surgery

12:12.565 --> 12:15.267
and she's, like, doing a dance,
running around,

12:15.267 --> 12:19.839
and he's like, "You are making
a mockery of homoeopathy."

12:19.839 --> 12:23.442
And she's like,
"Oh, you don't understand me."

12:23.442 --> 12:26.745
"I'm a woman of the theatre."

12:26.745 --> 12:29.482
It's a fractious marriage.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.083
Then what happens is,

12:31.083 --> 12:35.488
he takes on a beautiful young
secretary called Ethel Le Neve.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.290
He falls in love with her.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.993
So he's in the office
and she's typing

12:40.993 --> 12:43.129
and all the time he's just thinking,

12:43.129 --> 12:46.232
"Ethel, you're so beautiful
and I love you."

12:46.232 --> 12:50.436
"And I wish we could be together
but we can't because I'm married

12:50.436 --> 12:55.374
and it's the olden days,
it's 1903 to 1906."

12:55.374 --> 12:57.276
"I can't be with you."

12:57.276 --> 12:59.545
Then, 1906, he comes home early.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.814
He's like, "Cora, I'm back."

13:01.814 --> 13:04.383
And what does he find?

13:04.383 --> 13:07.052
Cora is in bed
with their German lodger.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.723
Curve ball. Who knew he had
a German lodger till now? We didn't.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.191
And he's like, "What?"

13:12.191 --> 13:16.896
And the German lodger is like,
"Oh, mein Gott, was ist das?"

13:16.896 --> 13:20.232
I really don't know enough German
to do this scene justice.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.402
"Bitte, bitte," that means please.
"Bitte, nein, nein."

13:23.402 --> 13:25.771
And he's like,
"You don't understand."

13:25.771 --> 13:26.906
"For three years,

13:26.906 --> 13:31.610
I've been not getting off with my
beautiful secretary and I could've."

13:32.444 --> 13:34.847
"But I haven't and now look at this!"

13:34.847 --> 13:40.119
And she's like, "Get out. You don't
love me like my German lodger does."

13:40.119 --> 13:42.655
And he's like,
"Oh, pretend we're married,

13:42.655 --> 13:47.960
but I'm gonna have all of the fun
with Ethel Le Neve that I can have."

13:49.295 --> 13:52.998
Then for four years
they just keep up the sham.

13:52.998 --> 13:57.903
But then, on 31st January 1910...

13:59.905 --> 14:01.440
Cora disappears.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.409
She disappeared.

14:03.409 --> 14:07.613
The next day,
Crippen says to Ethel Le Neve,

14:07.613 --> 14:09.882
"Hey, Cora's gone away. No big deal."

14:09.882 --> 14:13.719
"She's gone to...
America for some reason,

14:13.719 --> 14:16.689
like her family are ill or something.
Who cares?"

14:16.689 --> 14:20.125
"Anyway, would you like
all of her jewellery for no reason?"

14:20.125 --> 14:23.362
And Ethel's like, "Are you sure?
Like, where's she gone?"

14:23.362 --> 14:25.631
"Why would she give away
these jewels?"

14:25.631 --> 14:29.235
And Crippen's like,
"Shh, shh, don't worry about it."

14:29.235 --> 14:33.706
And she's like, "Sure, I'm sure
there's nothing sinister going on."

14:33.706 --> 14:37.409
Dr Crippen's wife, she was also
in the Music Hall Women's Guild.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.911
Because that is a thing.

14:38.911 --> 14:42.615
Then, like,
two days later or something,

14:42.615 --> 14:44.483
there's the Women's Guild ball.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.752
Dr Crippen goes to the ball.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.787
Why would you go to the ball?
Don't go!

14:48.787 --> 14:51.757
He shows up and he's like,
"Well, I've got a plus one."

14:51.757 --> 14:53.792
"I'll take my new girlfriend."

14:53.792 --> 14:56.762
"I'm sure her friends
won't find that suspicious."

14:56.762 --> 15:00.633
Pardon me. Pardon me.

15:00.633 --> 15:04.403
"Oh, this is my friend, Ethel."

15:04.403 --> 15:07.439
"Hey, everyone.
Here I am, wearing Cora's jewels,

15:07.439 --> 15:10.175
like what happened to Cora
wasn't sinister."

15:10.175 --> 15:14.647
So everyone in the Women's Guild
is like, "What the fuck?"

15:14.647 --> 15:17.016
"Seriously, this is not cool."

15:17.016 --> 15:19.985
"She would never give away her jewels
like that."

15:19.985 --> 15:23.956
He's like,
"Whoa, they're suspicious."

15:23.956 --> 15:27.426
"Don't worry, I'm very intelligent.
I'll sort this out."

15:27.426 --> 15:31.664
And he goes over and he's like,
"Guys, it's been a great night."

15:31.664 --> 15:36.935
"Also my wife is dead. Oh!
She ran away to see her family,

15:36.935 --> 15:39.905
but then she died suddenly
and she's been cremated,

15:39.905 --> 15:43.575
so don't investigate cos it's not
a big deal cos she's dead."

15:43.575 --> 15:46.045
And he leaves. And he's like...

15:48.080 --> 15:51.717
This guy, Dr Crippen,
doing everything right.

15:51.717 --> 15:56.188
The Women's Guild are like, "Right,
we're gonna go to the authorities."

15:56.188 --> 15:58.924
They go to the police
and they go to Inspector Dew.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.728
And he's like, "Good day to you."
"Inspector Dew. Here's the beef."

16:02.728 --> 16:06.632
"Our friend Cora disappeared and
her husband showed up at our party."

16:06.632 --> 16:09.134
"He was like,
'Oh, she's dead. Chill out.'"

16:09.134 --> 16:11.103
"And we were like, 'No, what?'"

16:11.103 --> 16:13.706
Inspector Dew is like,
"Don't worry, guys."

16:13.706 --> 16:15.874
"You're in the best hands possible."

16:15.874 --> 16:20.079
"I investigated Jack the Ripper
and we all know how that turned out."

16:20.079 --> 16:23.515
The ladies are like,
"Jack the Ripper was never caught."

16:23.515 --> 16:25.784
He's like,
"Hey, I'm a great detective."

16:25.784 --> 16:28.520
"Don't you worry your female heads
about this."

16:28.520 --> 16:30.556
"Somebody's gonna sort this out."

16:30.556 --> 16:33.392
And they're like,
"I suppose we have to trust you

16:33.392 --> 16:36.095
because it's 1910
and we have no option."

16:37.629 --> 16:40.599
So eventually he goes over
to Dr Crippen's house

16:40.599 --> 16:43.135
and he's like,
"Hello. Are you Dr Crippen?"

16:43.135 --> 16:46.071
He's like, "Yes, that's me,
homoeopath and doctor."

16:46.071 --> 16:47.906
"The two things are different."

16:47.906 --> 16:51.877
And he's like, "I'm Inspector Dew,
London Metropolitan Police."

16:51.877 --> 16:55.914
"Some women came to me. You know
what they're like. Blah, blah, blah."

16:55.914 --> 16:58.851
"They said that
you might have killed your wife."

16:58.851 --> 17:02.254
And Dr Crippen's like,
"What? That's crazy."

17:02.254 --> 17:06.425
Inspector Dew's like, "I know.
I believe you. You're a doctor."

17:06.425 --> 17:10.963
"Apparently. And I trust you.
Let's leave it at that."

17:10.963 --> 17:14.400
"Nice to meet you, sir."
"Nice to meet you."

17:14.400 --> 17:19.003
"Great. And if I ever need pointless
sugar pills, I'll come your way."

17:19.003 --> 17:20.906
"Why, thank you."
"Thank you."

17:20.906 --> 17:23.474
"Good night."
"Good night."

17:23.474 --> 17:25.344
And the matter was closed.

17:25.344 --> 17:28.113
He shuts the door
after Inspector Dew's gone

17:28.113 --> 17:33.452
and he's like, "Oh, my days.
I've been caught. I'm rumbled."

17:35.287 --> 17:38.223
So he's like, "Chill out, chill out."
He says to Ethel,

17:38.223 --> 17:40.993
"Hey, Ethel,
how do you fancy going on a cruise?"

17:40.993 --> 17:44.096
And Ethel's like, "OK.
I'll completely accept this

17:44.096 --> 17:45.764
like I completely accepted

17:45.764 --> 17:50.369
taking your dead wife's clothes,
jewellery and house. So let's do it."

17:50.369 --> 17:53.272
And Dr Crippen is like,
"Oh, by the way, Ethel,

17:53.272 --> 17:56.642
can you dress as a boy the whole time
and pretend to be my son?"

17:56.642 --> 17:59.278
"It's just one of my quirks.
It's my fetish."

17:59.278 --> 18:03.348
So, she's like, "If that's what
you like, I'll give it a go."

18:03.348 --> 18:05.083
So, in the middle of the night,

18:05.083 --> 18:07.986
they get the boat
and they're on their way to Canada.

18:07.986 --> 18:12.024
The fact that Crippen's left, he's
bolted, that freaks everyone out.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.726
The Women's Guild are like,

18:14.726 --> 18:19.665
"Inspector Dew, please, please
will you just search the house?"

18:19.665 --> 18:24.036
And Inspector Dew is like,
"Oh, sure, OK, fine."

18:24.036 --> 18:26.638
"I'll search the house. God, ladies."

18:29.074 --> 18:31.643
So, they go to the house
and he walks round

18:31.643 --> 18:33.512
and he's like, "She's not here."

18:33.512 --> 18:37.349
And they're like, "What?! You just
turned over one cushion, mate."

18:37.349 --> 18:38.550
"Look properly."

18:38.550 --> 18:41.987
And he's like, "Ah, she's not
in that cupboard. We're done."

18:41.987 --> 18:46.125
And they're like, "No." He's like,
"Ah, fine, I'll go to the basement."

18:50.629 --> 18:53.999
He goes to the basement.
He looks at the floorboards.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.667
"Whoa!"

18:55.667 --> 19:01.039
Bam! Straight away, there
is the torso of a murdered victim.

19:01.039 --> 19:05.110
It's got a dress on it,
it's got a feather boa on it,

19:05.110 --> 19:09.448
it's got a program next to the torso
that says Music Hall 1910.

19:09.448 --> 19:13.085
Cora Crippen.
We know it's hers, guys.

19:13.085 --> 19:17.489
He's like, "Ah, oh, guys."

19:17.489 --> 19:19.591
"I actually think you had a point."

19:20.826 --> 19:23.095
The papers have a field day.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.040
Cos he was on a ship.

19:35.040 --> 19:39.411
So all the papers are going crazy.
The Women's Institute's going crazy.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.079
Everyone's going crazy.

19:42.648 --> 19:48.554
Meanwhile, Crippen is on a boat
going to Canada.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.823
So, the captain of the boat,
Captain Henry George Kendal,

19:51.823 --> 19:53.559
he reads the paper every day.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.995
He's like, "Crippen be Trippin'?
Whoa, hello."

19:56.995 --> 19:59.665
"Because there's a guy on my boat
who's weird."

19:59.665 --> 20:02.234
"Like, he's with his son
but it's not his son."

20:02.234 --> 20:06.204
"They keep getting off with each
other and French kissing the place."

20:06.204 --> 20:08.006
He's like... (mimics explosion)

20:10.409 --> 20:14.513
"Right, I'm gonna send a telegram.
Even though I'm in a boat,

20:14.513 --> 20:17.983
I'm gonna send a telegram
straight back to the United Kingdom."

20:17.983 --> 20:21.286
"I have reason to believe
murderer Crippen is on my boat."

20:21.286 --> 20:25.023
"Woman does not look like man.
Is wearing trousers."

20:25.023 --> 20:26.558
And that is a big deal.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.094
That's the first time
that's ever happened,

20:29.094 --> 20:32.431
international correspondence
to catch a criminal.

20:32.431 --> 20:36.435
Inspector Dew straight away is like,
"I guess I should check it out."

20:36.435 --> 20:38.303
He gets on a boat, a quicker boat.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.808
Gets the fast boat
straight across the Atlantic.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.243
Gets there quicker.
Jumps on the other boat.

20:45.243 --> 20:50.082
He's like, "Hey, I've got you.
You're nicked. You are Dr Crippen."

20:50.082 --> 20:54.686
"Dr Crippen, you're guilty.
Also you hang to death."

20:56.088 --> 20:58.690
"Ethel Le Neve,
you're acquitted, goodbye."

20:58.690 --> 21:00.559
She's acquitted. Free woman.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.028
What happened to her?
We have no idea.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.465
Inspector Dew's like,
"Sorry, mate. It's the olden days."

21:06.465 --> 21:08.533
"You do the crime,
you do the time."

21:08.533 --> 21:11.803
"And by 'the time',
we mean we will kill you."

21:11.803 --> 21:15.974
Dr Crippen's like, "Oh, shit,
I didn't think this through."

21:18.877 --> 21:22.714
That is the story of Dr Crippen
who was A, a bad murderer

21:22.714 --> 21:26.585
and B, a terrible criminal,
and C, did not get away with it,

21:26.585 --> 21:29.955
so bad luck.
Don't be a bad-behaved person.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.562
Of course,
homoeopathy isn't real medicine.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.998
Not like crystal healing
or colour therapy.

21:39.998 --> 21:41.633
That's it for tonight.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.403
Don't look for next week's show
in the listings.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.240
You'll find us sleeping it off in
a bus shelter. Till then, goodnight.
