09:16.686 --> 09:17.774
Robin?

09:17.818 --> 09:19.950
[heavy breathing]

09:22.431 --> 09:23.911
[pants]

09:23.954 --> 09:26.087
Thank goodness
I've been working
on my... cardio.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.741
-And it's come down to me.
-[camcorder beeps]

09:27.784 --> 09:29.743
There's nothing left
to do now but film myself

09:29.786 --> 09:32.180
being more scared
than ever before.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.225
[sobbing] I'm so scared.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.879
So, so, so scared.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.229
[gasps] I survived
the Creepy Catcher

09:38.273 --> 09:40.318
because of
my moral superiority.

09:40.362 --> 09:44.627
If only my depraved friends
were still alive
to see my victory.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.412
-[screaming nearby]
-Another victim?

09:52.156 --> 09:53.593
[gasps]

09:53.636 --> 09:56.291
Look out!
The Creepy Catcher
is behind you!

09:56.944 --> 09:57.988
Relax, bruh.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.773
The Creepy Catcher
ain't no creep.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.905
He's just a sports enthusiast.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.691
He was coming after us
'cause he needed players
for the baseball game.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.127
Looks like you were wrong, bro.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.130
Ain'ts no consequences
to terrible teen choices.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.174
But if this was all

10:10.218 --> 10:12.437
to recruit a baseball team,

10:12.481 --> 10:14.918
why didn't he ask me?

10:14.962 --> 10:17.965
[all mumbling and chattering
awkwardly]

10:23.274 --> 10:25.233
-[chatter fades]
-[crickets chirping]

10:25.276 --> 10:27.931
I see.
Well, enjoy your game.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.672
[beeps]

10:29.716 --> 10:31.543
[sobbing]
This is my final video.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.764
I'm lonely.
So, so lonely!

10:34.808 --> 10:36.984
[sobbing heavily]
I'm so lonely.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.640
