Associate to builder services.</i>

03:29.000 --> 03:31.810
- Right?
- Yeah, and we'll cut it over here.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.164
Thought you finished this job.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.243
The owner wants the
driveway wider now.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.849
Heh. When they pay... They say.
Thank you.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.850
The newer guys take tests.
Like firemen.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.402
Yo, Pops, bet you didn't have to
push dollies at your old job.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.284
Guilty as charged.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.129
How you doing, Jenny?

04:06.600 --> 04:09.080
Mm-hm. Better now. Ha-ha-ha.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.289
Hi, Mr. McCall. Ralphie.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.965
What you got there?
Tuna.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.527
Bread?
Whole-grain, gluten-free.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.963
Okay. Condiments? Sprouts,
avocado and Vegenaise Mayo.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.650
Okay.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.966
A bone in the tuna.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.685
Oh...

04:33.840 --> 04:36.764
What? Potatoes are a vegetable.
I like crunchy things.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.162
Carrots are crunchy.
Dried seaweed.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.362
I'm a human, not a rabbit.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.370
To make security guard,
you gotta lose weight.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.167
Now, you asked me to help you, but
if you don't apply yourself...

04:48.360 --> 04:49.964
Yeah. Hey.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.330
Progress, not perfection.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.922
No more chips. No more chips.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.610
Who needs flavor?
Right?

07:28.600 --> 07:31.524
- All right, see you later, J.
- Have a good one, Billy.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.249
Fuck you.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.724
He catch that fish yet?

07:57.320 --> 07:58.560
Just hooked it.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.364
It's about damn time.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.722
Well, it's a big fish.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.565
Don't know if he can
hang on, though.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.484
Oh, no.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.125
Tooth and nail right now.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.244
Yeah, well, maybe
he's just too old.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.126
Thought you were gonna
give up refined sugar.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.004
I am. When?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.680
Any day now. Yeah?

08:22.880 --> 08:25.326
Bad for your vocal cords.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.043
Body, mind, spirit, remember?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.679
I bought a little machine
for making demos.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.451
Yeah?
I bet you're good.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.691
What makes you say that?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.405
Intuition.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.968
All right, well, I'll
see you later, Jake.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.562
Okay. See you later, honey.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.722
You let me know what happens
with that, uh, fish.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.291
Okay. All right, I'll see you.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.645
Hey!

09:29.240 --> 09:30.924
You'll owe me $100. Watch.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.283
Hey, yo, Pops. We betting on what
you did before you got here.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.481
Like, for a living.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.404
I'm saying insurance, claims.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.080
He was a stock dude,
man, on Wall Street.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.090
I was a Pip. Yo,
you were a pimp?

09:43.280 --> 09:46.045
No, not a pimp. A Pip.
P-I-P. Pip.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.766
The fuck is a Pip? Why
you curse so much?

09:48.960 --> 09:52.043
You know, like Gladys Knight
and the Pips. Like this:

09:52.200 --> 09:53.201
Unh.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.401
Check this out!

09:54.600 --> 09:56.080
- Oh, come on!
- Stop it.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.121
Yeah. Break it.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.482
Uh-uh. Don't do that right now.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.170
- Oh, the spin?
- What?

10:01.360 --> 10:04.648
Wait a minute. You're gonna
blow the whistle? Oh!

10:04.840 --> 10:08.845
Come on. I'm gonna look it up right now.
Man, I'm looking this up.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.251
Yo, so which one were you?
The one on the right.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.410
Hey, do it again! Yo,
that's not him right there.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.921
Man, that's him with an Afro.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.282
He's bald. So he had a wig on.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.164
That's gone, yo. That's him.

Yeah, he did.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.251
It's a happy ending-

11:14.480 --> 11:16.801
Well, not exactly.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.528
Old man tied the fish to the side of
the boat, had to row back to shore,

11:21.720 --> 11:23.961
fish bled in the water,

11:24.200 --> 11:25.725
sharks came

11:25.920 --> 11:29.322
and ate the whole fish till
there was nothing left.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.525
That's just kind of a waste, isn't it?
Depends upon how you look at it.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.763
The old man met his adversary when he
thought that part of his life was over.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.088
He saw himself in the fish.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.171

11:44.320 --> 11:46.402
Came to respect it
the more it fought.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.049
Why didn't he just
let the fish go?

11:49.240 --> 11:52.722

Fish gotta be the fish.

So?

15:33.920 --> 15:35.206
I don't know.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.563
You know, I just kind of

Ow.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.051
It's good. You know, you
don't look like a Bob.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.163
Oh, yeah?
Thank you.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.442
You look like a Robert.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.331
Robert reads books like this,

16:01.560 --> 16:03.528
and Bob watches TV.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.090
My real name's Alina.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.689
What happened to your face?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.087
Something stupid.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.810
Look, it's not professional. Just
tell me what you think, okay?

16:38.960 --> 16:42.601
Oh, wow. Alina the singer.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.408
You and I know what I really am.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.688

16:54.720 --> 16:56.449
Maybe in your world, Robert.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.689
Doesn't happen that way in mine.
Change your world.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.766
There's no ring. Hm?

17:08.880 --> 17:11.849
On your wedding finger,
there's no ring. No.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.690
No Mrs. Robert at home?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.205
No.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.845

17:18.079 --> 17:19.444
Once.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.329
Did you break her heart?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.809
She broke mine.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.965
You know, I see a lot
of widowed guys.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.529
Something in your eyes.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.609
You know, it's not sad.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.050
It's just kind of...

17:43.720 --> 17:45.370
lost, you know?

17:54.120 --> 17:55.565
You always read books?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.607
My wife did. She, uh...

17:59.480 --> 18:02.370
She was working through the 100
Books Everybody Should Read.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.490
She made it to 97,
so I figured...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.444
I'd give it a shot.

18:12.160 --> 18:17.087
And one day we'd have something to
talk about when we get together.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.410
Wow, a hundred books. Yeah.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.331
Holy moly. Heh, heh.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.324
How many have you read, Robert?
Ninety-one.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.329
Sorry, this damn thing.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.124
Ninety-one books, though.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.207
You're almost done. Almost.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.404
What are you gonna do after that?
Singing lessons.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.362
Then I'm gonna open
a donut factory.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.848
Heh-heh-heh. I am. What?
Why you laughing?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.684
- I love being up at this hour.
- Yeah?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.201
Yeah. You know,
everything's so dark.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.210
It makes everything
seem possible again.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.961
Yeah, me, I can't
sleep at night.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.970
Yeah, well, I get to
hear your stories.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.525
What's your new one about?

19:17.760 --> 19:21.321
Oh, it's about a guy who thinks
he's a knight in shining armor.

19:21.520 --> 19:26.367
The only thing is, he lives in a world
where knights don't exist anymore.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.328
Kind of sounds like my world.
Heh.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.409
I'm just up the block.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.602
I'm gonna grab a
cab or something.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.127
Thank you for the
quiet voice, Robert.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.728
You are very welcome, Alina.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.285
Yeah.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.801

Good night.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.565
Shit.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.410

19:55.080 --> 19:56.844

19:58.360 --> 20:00.169

to that customer?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.169
Slavi, he hit me.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.925
Who do you think you are? Hm?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.605
It's all right.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.881
Understand.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.407
It's all right, Robert.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.640
Let's talk about you not
answering my calls.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.160
Bitch!

20:16.600 --> 20:18.170

20:21.240 --> 20:23.641

20:25.000 --> 20:28.641

I send you another one. Better.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.645
Don't be shy. Make the call.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.211
Understand.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.200

21:29.400 --> 21:31.129

21:53.880 --> 21:57.726

Someone beat her up real good.

22:06.120 --> 22:10.682
<i>Dr. Paley to ICU. Dr.
Paley to ICU, please.</i>

22:15.560 --> 22:18.962
<i>Dr. Mark to the pharmacy. Dr.
Mark to the pharmacy, please.</i>

22:30.520 --> 22:31.885
Alina.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.090
You'll be okay, Alina.
You'll be okay.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.282
Oh. Watch it. Don't
you worry about it.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.324
It's okay. It's okay.
Here you go.

23:30.520 --> 23:34.411
I can... It's fine. Thank you.
Got it.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.286
How's she doing?

23:39.560 --> 23:40.846
Alina. How's she doing?

23:42.360 --> 23:44.966
Who are you?
Just a friend.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.610
A guy hit her.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.322
And she hit him back.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.887
A guy called Slavi.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.965
So Slavi made example of her.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.930
They do that.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.363
They burned one girl's
face with battery acid.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.766
Keep her around as a
reminder for the rest of us.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.206
They brought Teri
over very young.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.611
Think she got to the point where

24:26.800 --> 24:30.009
she thought her life
could be hers one day.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.931
Slavi reminded her
it never would be.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.286
He said he'd cut her
throat next time.

24:40.240 --> 24:45.041
He said a whore who fucks and can't
talk might be worth twice as much.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.891
You and <i>I</i> know what <i>I</i> really am.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.564
<i>It's something in your eyes.</i>

25:36.160 --> 25:38.481
<i>Change your world.
Anything you wanna be.</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:41.451
<i>He said he'd cut her
throat next time.</i>

25:58.680 --> 26:02.810
Why is that piece of shit
in my parking space?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.331
Hi, Slavi.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.443
Are they upstairs? Yes.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.885
Tevi. You collect from
that fuck, Dmitri?

26:38.080 --> 26:39.650
Yes.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.251
He asked for forgiveness.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.090
Forgiveness?

26:46.200 --> 26:48.646
I told him.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.049
What am I, Jesus Christ?
Ha-ha-ha.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.966
You lost, dedushka?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.606
- How did he get up here?
- I don't know.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.411
Should I get rid of him?

27:21.600 --> 27:22.681
No.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.368
I'm here for that girl.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.641
You gave me that a
couple of nights ago.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.560
We give out lots of cards.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.122
You still can get
it up, dedushka?

27:42.960 --> 27:45.201
I'm here about a certain girl.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.400
She got beat up pretty bad.

27:49.400 --> 27:53.564
I'm thinking that maybe you
have wrong address, dedushka.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.650
This girl, she have name?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.241
Her name's Alina. Alina?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.243
Mm-mm. Ah...

28:07.400 --> 28:09.050
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.168
But whoever she is, I'm sure she
must know how to suck the cock.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.289
Uh... Okay. Um...

28:24.440 --> 28:26.442
Look, I understand.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.081
These girls that you, uh...

28:29.440 --> 28:31.124
That you represent.

28:31.320 --> 28:36.281
I understand it's like they're
an investment, so, urn...

28:36.800 --> 28:39.371
I can give you $9800.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.526
It's cash.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.768
You're wanting to give me $9000?

28:45.960 --> 28:48.122
Ninety-eight hundred. Cash.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.481
For what?
Her freedom.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.045
Uh-huh. Heh, heh.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.250
Can you believe this guy?

28:56.440 --> 29:00.126
This guy gonna give me $9000
for one single piece of pussy.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.731
Ah, must be Ferrari pussy.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.969
You fucking Americans think
you can come into my place

29:11.160 --> 29:12.730
and buy whatever you want.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.970
Beautiful Russian girls, no problem,
just throw down this bullshit money.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.562
You fucking insult me.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.685
Ha-ha-ha. I'm just
fucking with you, man.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.050
But you got very big balls coming in here.
I like that.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.722
So, $9000

29:44.880 --> 29:46.245
for the troublemaker.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.130
One month.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.771
That's it.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.088
You think this is
one-time payment?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.129
I make this off this
girl in two weeks.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.482
That girl is still child.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.646
I still can sell her
as virgin, huh?

30:12.800 --> 30:14.882
This makes prime
earner for good while.

30:19.320 --> 30:24.042
Take your fucking money and go back to
your house and jerk off 9800 times.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.607
Then come crawling back
here and talk to me, huh?

30:26.840 --> 30:28.968
She'll be used up
by then for sure.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.642
Maybe then I will let you
have her for nothing. Hm?

30:45.520 --> 30:46.851
Okay.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.611
You're okay, dedushka?
Bye-bye.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.604
<i>You know amerikantsy.</i>

31:29.560 --> 31:30.846
You forget something?

32:14.560 --> 32:16.369
Sixteen seconds.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.287
One one-thousand,

32:20.480 --> 32:23.609
two one-thousand,
three one-thousand.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.646
Eight one-thousand.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.485
Understand?

33:22.800 --> 33:25.610
Twenty-eight minus 9, 19.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.491
Nineteen.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.766
Your heart's beating three
times the normal rate.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.287
Because you're losing
so much blood.

33:53.920 --> 33:58.084
About 30 seconds, your
body's gonna shut down

33:58.280 --> 34:00.601
and you're gonna suffocate.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.809
Alina, the girl you beat half
to death, her life will go on.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.891
Yours is gonna end right
here, on this funky floor

34:09.080 --> 34:11.081
over $9800.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.088
You should have taken the money.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.841
Who are you?

34:23.080 --> 34:25.081
Twenty-six one-thousand,

34:25.280 --> 34:27.681
<i>27</i> one-thousand,

34:27.880 --> 34:30.406
28 one-thousand.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.449
I'm sorry.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.240
Mr. McCall, it's lunchtime.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.886
Mr. McCall.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.445
Lunchtime.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.442
You test tomorrow and
you're eating that?

36:01.680 --> 36:03.170
These are for you.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.006
Open it.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.449
I made the weight.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.564
Tomorrow I'm gonna Ace that test.
Thanks to you.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.126
What happened?
Uh...

36:21.320 --> 36:23.561
Hit it on something stupid.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.928
In what investigators are calling
a <i>gangland-style execution,</i>

37:00.120 --> 37:02.851
<i>five men were killed at
some point last night</i>

37:03.040 --> 37:05.088
<i>in an office above
this restaurant.</i>

37:05.320 --> 37:09.609
<i>Police sources have said the killings
have all the earmarks of a turf war</i>

37:09.800 --> 37:13.168
<i>between rival factions. Names
are not yet being released...</i>

37:31.880 --> 37:33.120
How's it going?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.890
How you doing, sir?
Morgan Pederson.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.407
I know who you are.
Get in the car.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.491
Take me to the murder scene.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.842
We figured two, maybe three, guys
killed them all that quickly.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.441
If it was a power play,
no one saw it coming.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.450
None of our informants heard
about this going down.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.723
Security system's drive was
taken so we're blind in here.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.606
At 11:17, a waiter goes up with a
tray of food, finds them dead.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.283
I want images from every security
camera within a six-block radius.

39:20.480 --> 39:24.121
If you have any trouble,
call that number...

39:25.200 --> 39:26.884
and it will be taken care of.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.290
Phones charged and on. I
tend to call at odd hours.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.484
Now, if you could drive
me to my residence.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.042
Hey, wait a second, Mr.
Sunshine. Um...

39:38.240 --> 39:40.447
What do I look like to you?
A chauffeur?

39:44.520 --> 39:47.569
This is our town.
You're a fucking guest.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.923
Let me apologize for my conduct.

39:57.160 --> 40:03.202
It was a long flight on short notice,
and I like to focus, to work quickly.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.200
The deaths of Mr. Pushkin's men have
interrupted his operations here.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.882
Imports, movements of
goods, have all ceased.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.445
That's unacceptable.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.287
I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in
when people like you fuck up.

40:16.440 --> 40:19.523
Mm. I don't like your tone...
I'm accountable now.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.849
You have taken Mr.
Pushkin's money for years.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.931
Money that comes with conditions.
Non-negotiable conditions.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.647
Problem you're having with me is
you think you matter. You don't.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.003
I am all that matters.
And so we're clear:

40:34.240 --> 40:37.562
I'm not here to say "please."

40:38.560 --> 40:40.528
I'm here to tell you what to do.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.449
Be ready for business.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.324
We open tomorrow.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.610
Brian, you seen Ralphie? Supposed to
be taking that security guard test.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.643
Called in and quit. Quit?

41:00.840 --> 41:03.730
No notice either. Kids, right?

41:24.280 --> 41:25.611
We're closed.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.689
Mr. McCall. Ralphie.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.848
Heard you quit today.
I got worried.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.047
Uh...

41:31.200 --> 41:34.841
Oh, uh, my mom had a little
accident here last night.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.610
There was a fire.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.689
I see. So I'm gonna help
out around here now.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.690
Okay.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.567
We have a lot of work to do.
Okay.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.888
Yeah, so... Need some help?

42:05.120 --> 42:07.487
Yeah, if you're not busy,
that'd be awesome.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.011
Helping you.

42:19.280 --> 42:23.490
Teddy, the Irish are clean on this one.
They had nothing to do with it, huh?

42:23.720 --> 42:25.768
You gonna sit down
with all these guys?

42:25.960 --> 42:30.409
- I'm telling you.
- Yes, I understand. Duly noted.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.609
Listen, huh? Do me a
favor, all right?

42:58.840 --> 43:02.401
Whatever you do, don't call
him "Little John," okay?

43:02.840 --> 43:06.322
Frank, why you working for
these fucking Russians?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.371
My money not good enough?

43:08.600 --> 43:11.922
I respect your business.
Mr. Looney.

43:13.240 --> 43:16.961
You understand why I'm
compelled to make this visit.

43:17.160 --> 43:21.370
I don't know shit about what went down
or who you should be out looking for.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.882
If I wanna take over
anything, I'd fucking do it.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.929
There'd be nothing left to you.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.289
So maybe you just don't
understand who the fuck I am.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.720
John. Easy, huh?

43:31.960 --> 43:35.362
Don't "easy," Frank. Shut the fuck up!
Fucking flipperhead.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.040
See, I hate you
fucking Russians.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.766
You're all crazy and
you're arrogant.

43:40.960 --> 43:45.124
Now, the Irish, we came here for
a piece of the American dream.

43:45.320 --> 43:49.041
You people come over here to
steal it, so fuck all of you.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.641
Well, Mr. Looney, I
appreciate your candor.

43:51.840 --> 43:56.801
It's refreshing, and tells me that you're
not smart enough to have done this.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.401
The fuck? Which brings
me to my next issue.

43:59.600 --> 44:03.525
We pay you 15 percent
to do business here.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.246
The additional 10 percent
you steal, we ignore.

44:06.440 --> 44:09.171
We anticipated it, as you
people are such clichés.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.160
The fact that you're a rat to the
Feds is also tolerable, Little John.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.681
The fuck? What we
will not tolerate is.

44:15.920 --> 44:19.447
No information, no protection,

44:19.640 --> 44:22.962
no assurances. You
understand, Little Johnny?

44:23.160 --> 44:25.686
Who do you think you are?
Who I am, or what I am?

44:25.880 --> 44:30.010
Who I am is complicated. What
I am is easier. I'm a threat.

44:30.200 --> 44:33.727
I alter outcomes. Throw
this motherf... Unh!

44:41.840 --> 44:45.367
<i>Whoa, doctor! Call</i> a <i>doctor.
Unbelievable!</i>

44:45.560 --> 44:47.369
<i>It's Napoli in the clutch!</i>

44:47.560 --> 44:49.164
<i>Holy cow!</i>

44:52.120 --> 44:53.849
Oh, fuck!

44:55.920 --> 44:57.445
<i>A tie game. Unbelievable!</i>

44:57.640 --> 45:01.281
<i>That ball was absolutely
massacred by Mike Napoli.</i>

45:07.680 --> 45:08.966
<i>A home run by Napoli.</i>

45:09.160 --> 45:12.164
<i>- Can things change in an instant.
- They certainly can.</i>

45:12.360 --> 45:15.250
<i>This game was over before
this half-inning started.</i>

45:15.480 --> 45:16.891
<i>It is certainly over now!</i>

45:17.080 --> 45:20.368
<i>Six to five, Boston
over New York...</i>

45:28.240 --> 45:29.526
Hey!

45:30.080 --> 45:32.481
Hey! Hey-

45:32.680 --> 45:35.650
This is my town. Do you understand me?
This is my home.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.286
You cannot run around
like a wild animal.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.209
What the fuck was that?

45:40.400 --> 45:41.970
It's a message.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.051
It says, "I'm here."

45:55.760 --> 45:58.161
What really happened
in there, Ralphie?

46:00.800 --> 46:02.848
Faulty wire or something.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.690
We both know that's not true.

46:07.480 --> 46:11.280
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Hey, you didn't waste my time.

46:11.480 --> 46:15.087
My mom doesn't have
much except this place.

46:15.280 --> 46:19.126
When stuff like this happens, I
just gotta put everything on hold

46:19.320 --> 46:21.402
and help her out, you know?

46:23.160 --> 46:26.323
I wasn't gonna pass the
security guard test anyway.

46:32.200 --> 46:36.728
Was there anything unusually strange
about Slavi before he was murdered?

46:38.040 --> 46:42.170
Did he mention a name perhaps?
Agitated about something?

46:42.400 --> 46:46.121
Slavi never did his business
in front of the girls.

46:46.360 --> 46:47.646
Tevi handled us.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.448
We can't locate one of the other
girls from Slavi's stable. Teri.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.162
You know her? No.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.364
Where we might find her?
No. Sorry.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.208
I didn't know her that well.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.400
<i>Was my message received, Teddy?</i>

47:14.480 --> 47:16.164
Yes, Mr. Pushkin.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.523
All of our associates...
Irish, Italians, Armenians.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.610
Are all denying any
knowledge or involvement.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.962
<i>We cannot show weakness. I
need this wrapped up quickly.</i>

47:27.160 --> 47:28.844
It will be.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.520
Of course, don't worry.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.960
Good.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.202
<i>Now enough of what
you don't know.</i>

47:35.400 --> 47:37.402
<i>Tell me what you do know.</i>

47:39.440 --> 47:44.048
Well, I'm still sifting through things,
but the killings were spontaneous.

47:45.040 --> 47:48.362
Whoever did this
specialized in killing.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.361
I've rarely seen
skills like this.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.370
I don't think it's someone
we've encountered before.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.001
<i>Whoever it is, just
find him, Teddy.</i>

47:57.200 --> 48:00.044
<i>I'm talking over a million
barrels, this delivery.</i>

48:00.240 --> 48:02.891
- Understand?
- It will all be well.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.684
I'll take care of it.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.887
<i>When you do, be loud about it.</i>

48:08.080 --> 48:10.162
<i>I don't want this
happening again.</i>

48:10.400 --> 48:12.004
Of course.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.770
Come on.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.291
Stuff it in.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.050
See that?

48:59.240 --> 49:01.163
That son of a bitch.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.127
- Yeah.
- Come on.

49:10.040 --> 49:12.646
- We're closed. Get out.
- Let's go.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.211
Time to go.

49:15.840 --> 49:16.921
Nice to see you.

49:26.680 --> 49:29.923
See? You pay on time,
no more problems.

49:30.120 --> 49:32.043
Ha-ha-ha. All right, let's go.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.725
Mamacita, you need
to clean the grease.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.843
It'll cause a fire. Good accent.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.800
See you next week.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.440
- Let's go get a blowie.
- Hey, officers.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.450
Whoa, put the light down.
What's up?

49:48.640 --> 49:52.008
I'd like to report a crime.
Really? Call 911.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.202
Let's get out of here.
Fuck that guy.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.290
Should shoot that motherfucker.
Take it easy.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.603
How did you get this job?
I blew the commissioner.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.691
<i>Why waste city services</i>

50:04.880 --> 50:07.690
when I got two corrupt
cops right in front of me?

50:07.880 --> 50:09.803
It's that guy. This fucking guy?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.048
Yeah. Back up.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.123
How'd you get that
fucking number?

50:26.320 --> 50:28.129
- Wasn't hard.
- Yeah?

50:28.320 --> 50:31.369
<i>- Neither was this.
- Ask the lady down the street.</i>

50:31.560 --> 50:33.369
<i>The one who had the fire.</i>

50:33.560 --> 50:36.882
<i>Same thing could happen to you
with your whole family inside.</i>

50:37.080 --> 50:39.651
<i>- Open it.
- You pay like everybody else.</i>

50:40.840 --> 50:42.126
How many copies?

50:43.840 --> 50:45.126
One.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.284
You must have a death wish, pal.

50:47.520 --> 50:50.729
What the fuck do you want, huh?
Huh?

50:50.920 --> 50:52.922
The people you took
the money from,

50:53.120 --> 50:55.964
you should give it back. Ha-ha-ha.
Why would we do that?

50:56.160 --> 50:58.686
That would be in the best
interest of everyone.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.291
Really? Yeah.

51:00.480 --> 51:03.609
Maybe our best interest is
to tie a block around you

51:03.800 --> 51:05.848
and throw you in
the Mystic, huh?

51:06.080 --> 51:09.243
Let's do that. It's a good idea.

51:16.520 --> 51:19.046
You're supposed to stand
for something, punk.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.526
Fuck.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.888
Protect and serve.
Uphold the law.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.920
Justice.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.770
Remember?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.331
Who the fuck are you?

51:39.120 --> 51:43.284
<i>Tomorrow you'll have returned all the
money you extorted from those people.</i>

51:43.480 --> 51:45.482
<i>Tell them it will
never happen again.</i>

51:45.680 --> 51:48.445
<i>Do that, and this video
will never be seen.</i>

51:48.640 --> 51:52.167
<i>You don't, and a half an hour later
you'll watch the uncut version</i>

51:52.360 --> 51:54.488
<i>on every news
outlet in the area.</i>

51:55.200 --> 51:59.444
<i>Now, I'm offering you a chance
to do the right thing. Take it.</i>

51:59.640 --> 52:02.291
That fucking hurt more
than the beating.

52:17.120 --> 52:20.408
Mr. McCall. Are you done
standing around or what?

52:30.440 --> 52:32.522
All the other girls have...

52:33.360 --> 52:40.050
claimed that you were
very close to Teri. Huh?

52:43.600 --> 52:45.682
You lied to me about that.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.046
It's pretty.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.328
When did you last talk to her?

53:13.560 --> 53:17.201
Over a week ago. Mm-hm.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.204
I went to the hospital.

53:22.840 --> 53:24.251
I saw her there.

53:25.320 --> 53:27.368
Did anyone else visit her?

53:28.440 --> 53:29.726
Yes.

53:29.920 --> 53:31.604
A man. A man?

53:31.800 --> 53:33.962
Customer? No.

53:34.160 --> 53:36.162
A nice man. A black man.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.846
He wanted to know
what happened to her.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.371
His name?

53:41.200 --> 53:42.884
He didn't say.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.724
And your friend, Teri?

53:47.920 --> 53:50.890
No one saw her after
she left hospital.

53:52.120 --> 53:54.168
After what they did to her.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.288
And you contacted her? No.

53:57.480 --> 53:59.164
No one saw her.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.771
Look at me. Are you
telling me the truth?

54:02.960 --> 54:05.611
You telling me the truth?
The truth? Yes. Yes.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.763
You telling me the truth? Yes.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.847
- Telling me the truth?
- Yes.

54:21.680 --> 54:23.400
Would you like some water?

54:25.280 --> 54:27.089
Moisten your throat.

54:35.040 --> 54:36.326
Thank you.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.806
Sweet.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.526
My angel.

54:42.360 --> 54:45.603
Hm?
Yes. Please. Please.

54:50.080 --> 54:53.721
So beautiful. So beautiful. Please,
please, Teddy. Please, Teddy.

54:53.920 --> 54:56.207
But so deceitful. Please.
Please don't.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.721
So fucking deceitful.
Please don't.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.571
You're... You're hurting me!

55:01.760 --> 55:03.603
Please stop.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.771
Let's go, Home Mart!

55:46.960 --> 55:49.247
- Let's go!
- Keep it going, Home Mart!

55:51.080 --> 55:52.081
Here we go. Oh, oh, oh!

55:52.280 --> 55:54.362
I got it!
I got it! I got it!

55:55.640 --> 55:57.085
Yeah!

55:57.280 --> 55:58.725
Yeah!

55:59.440 --> 56:02.523
There you go!
Way to go, Bobby!

56:02.680 --> 56:06.048
There's no place like Home Mart.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.931
Yeah.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.450
Oh!

56:15.640 --> 56:18.962
- I see you!
- Ralphie, bravo!

56:19.560 --> 56:21.449
You passed your test!

56:21.640 --> 56:23.085
Looking good, man.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.009
Hey, did they give you a gun?

56:37.520 --> 56:39.522
What the hell he
call us in here for?

56:39.720 --> 56:42.291
Maybe he's finally done
chasing his own tail.

56:42.480 --> 56:45.529
- He needs to go home.
- Waste of fucking time.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.563
Yeah, that sounds about right.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.047
I matched the arrival
and departure times

56:51.240 --> 56:54.449
of everyone going in and
out of the restaurant.

56:54.680 --> 56:59.208
This person walks in the front door
several minutes after Slavi arrived,

56:59.400 --> 57:01.209
but never comes out.

57:05.720 --> 57:08.041
All right. Later. All right.
Thanks.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.324
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.841
Can you do a quick
card refund for me?

57:16.040 --> 57:19.010
Gentleman's in a hurry.
Open that fucking register.

57:20.400 --> 57:23.085
Move, move. Empty the register.
Now.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.487
Go ahead, open this thing up.

57:25.680 --> 57:29.730
Tell this bitch to fucking move it.
Open the register up right now.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.171
Move.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.167
All of it. Give me all of it.

57:40.680 --> 57:42.842
Come on. Move, move, move.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.206
- That ring too. Give me that ring.
- No.

57:49.440 --> 57:52.125
- Give me that fucking ring, I said.
- Please.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.850
It was my mother's.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.327
Fuck your mother.
Give me that ring.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.480
- Take it off.
- It was my mother's.

58:29.600 --> 58:30.601
Shh.

58:30.760 --> 58:32.842
I don't care. Give
me the fucking ring.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.928
- Please.
- It's okay, Jenny.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.561
You Okay?

59:13.720 --> 59:15.370
Yeah.

59:21.520 --> 59:25.366
Hey, listen. Police said the
guy's done four like this.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.609
Shot a guy over in Somerville
a month ago, so...

59:30.360 --> 59:31.771
It's only money.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.244
You okay? Hey, Ralphie.
Still a little freaked out.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.171
Well, if you need
anything, let me know.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.805
Thanks, Ralphie.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.444
Oh, my God.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.570
My ring?

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.006
Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you.
Yeah.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.329
We're looking into a homicide
that occurred two weeks ago.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.887
Five dead. Russian restaurant.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.209
I heard about it on TV. I
happened to be there that night.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.686
Oh, you were?
Yeah.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.326
You wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
Right.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.849
We're just checking to see if anyone
remembered anything suspicious.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.451
Not that I recall.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.564
May I ask why you dined at
that particular restaurant?

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.000
I like pirozhki.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.086
There's five Russian restaurants in
walking distance of your apartment.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.601
I assume they all
serve pirozhki.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.570
Wow. I was meeting a friend.
It was her idea.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.286
Then I guess I should talk...
Sheila Saunders.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.485
But she can't help. She wasn't there.
Her daughter had a fever.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.926
Didn't stay long? I
didn't check my watch.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.361
I see. Well, thanks
for your cooperation.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.804
Very welcome. Tell me,
do you know this girl?

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.411
Yeah, I don't know...

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.080
I don't remember where from.
What happened?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.971
She fell down and broke her neck.
Did she?

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.683
I'll be in touch.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.531
Don't you wanna leave
me your card, officer?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.725
In case I remember anything? That's
what policemen usually do, right?

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.129
Must have given them all out.
How'd you find me?

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.324
I paid cash. No reservation.
How'd you find me?

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.888
Well, that's what we do, Mr.
McCall. We who?

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.129
We find people we need to find.
We who?

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.326
Everything about him is wrong.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.087
And his military history?

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.325
No.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.164
Keep digging-

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.848
This is what we have
on McCall so far:

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.203
College-educated. Works a
straight 40 at the Home Mart.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.922
Bank statements, tax
returns, all jive.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.245
Looks pretty normal.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.046
All lies. Fabricated.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.524
<i>We need to take him cleanly.</i>

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.051
Alive.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.811
A place without
cameras, no witnesses.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.610
A man with his skills, I want
to know who he really is.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.201
I want to know who
he's working for.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.485
How you doing?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.249
Give me a coffee, please.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.411
An egg sandwich too. On a roll.
No cheese, please.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.170
You got it.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.929
I'll be back in a minute.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.844
Is it just you, or are we
waiting for someone else?

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.206
I'm sorry. What?

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.246
Your hands.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.848
If you work on power lines, your
hands wouldn't look like that.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.247
We gotta be waiting
for somebody else.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.126
Motherfucker.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.723
Hands where I can see them.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.801
We're gonna take a little walk
across the street. Black Denali.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.326
Here we go.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.045
What the fuck?

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.282
Vary from these instructions
and I'll kill you, understand?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.524
All right.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.882
Stand up.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.161
What the fuck is this?
Masters, let's go.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.285
No witnesses.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.451
What's going on out there?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.128
What the fuck?
Let's go.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.367
Shh.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.962
What the hell is this guy doing?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.400
Remar, you got A side.
Front, follow.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.648
You got C. I got B.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.126
Alive.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.209
Yeah, yeah, alive. I'm on it.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:09.725
Motherfucker.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.921
Motherfucker suckered me.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.125
Goddamn it.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.491
Shit.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.208
Pederson, check the closets,
the kitchen, the back porch.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.606
<i>Closet's empty.</i>

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.044
<i>- Nothing on the back porch.
- Fucking guy. Lives like a monk.</i>

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.169
<i>This guy's got a lot of books.</i>

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.043
Remar, stop fucking around.
Check the computer.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.164
This place is way too clean, boss.
Something doesn't feel right.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.644
We've got an empty script.
"Meclizine."

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.922
It's used for airsickness.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.367
Travel items purchased
three days ago.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.803
<i>Bought an open-ended plane
ticket to Mexico two days ago.</i>

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.043
Leaves Logan 10 A.M. tomorrow.
Guy knew this was coming.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.607
- He's running.
- Get someone at the airport.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.001
<i>- He is not going anywhere.
- What are you talking about?</i>

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.600
<i>He's watching us.</i>

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.570
What do you wanna do?

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.011
Find him, or I will
bring people who can.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.091
If you've come for help,
I can't give you any.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.567
I understand. Do you?

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.484
Just came for tea.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.326
Just, uh...

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.325
Robert, I have very little
influence these days.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.642
I'm not at the Agency anymore.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.842
I consult on a few things.
That's it.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.841
Susan, I just need to
know who this man is.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.809
Who is he to you?

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.202
That's why I'm here,
trying to find out.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.528
Tell me what's going on. Please.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.244
You had a nice funeral, in
case you were wondering.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.804
You know, when they told
Susan you were dead,

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.084
she couldn't comprehend it.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.004
She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert."

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.929
And not from something as
trivial as a car bomb."

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.561
That you're alive

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.047
is a big relief.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.445
But it didn't come as a
complete surprise to her.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.529
We used to talk about you
over the years, and she said

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.564
if anyone could have
figured a way out,

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.770
a way to walk away from it
all for good, you know,

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.928
like a real fresh start...

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.884
it would have been...

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.885
you.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.640
<i>You didn't take out
five pimps, Robert.</i>

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.840
You took out the East Coast
hub of Vladimir Pushkin.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.280
Pushkin. Mm-hm.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.524
An oligarch who jumped in
bed with the Russian mafia,

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:20.203
only he funds everything: Gasoline,
weapons, girls, you name it.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.330
He's built an intricate
network on both U.S. coasts

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.807
that are incredibly
well-insulated.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.890
His money and political
ties make him untouchable.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.127
Your friend here is who Pushkin
sends when he's got a problem.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.041
Teddy Rensen. Real name,
Nicolai ltchenko.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.402
Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.204
He's formidable and smart.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.801
Ran a wing of the secret
police for years.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.809
Went private when
the Union fell.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.129
Basically, he's a sociopath
with a business card.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.004
Mm.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.650
Thank you, darling.
You know these two?

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.080
Uh...

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.245
Boston P.D. Probably on
Pushkin's payroll, I assume.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.603
Three years. Detective Remar
and Detective Pederson.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.245
Only now they're dead.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.843
They found them yesterday in the trunk of
their car in the precinct parking lot.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.926
Suffocated. Testicles blown off
and shoved down their throats.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.600
Classic Russian mob hit.
Teddy's work.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.883
Third one, Detective Masters hasn't
shown up for work in several days.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.289
Robert, I don't have to
tell you what happens next.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.161
He won't stop until he kills
you and anyone you care about.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.010
Didn't sleep a wink, did you?

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.971
Hey.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.641
Mm.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.406
Robert, that girl, Alina...

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.965
Why?

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.727
I couldn't tell you
why it mattered.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.924
Why what they did to her,
that mattered to me so much.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.007
One day somebody

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.243
does something unspeakable
to someone else to...

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.326
someone you hardly knew,

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.244
and you...

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.849
do something about it
because you can. Mm.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.560
Because it's who you are?
Hm? Mm.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.449
Who you've always been?

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.087
Sometimes we make the wrong choices
to get to the right place.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.691
Mm.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.442
I know a part of you
died when Vivian did.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.126
But not the part she
loved the most.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.724
Go be him.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.611
Yep.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.528
Don't forget to say goodbye.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.491
Good bye.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.003
Everything all right?

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.004
Were you able to help him?

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.649
He didn't come for help.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.923
He came for permission.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.165
Fuck.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.484
What the fuck?

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.007
Testing one, two, three, four.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.525
Pushkin.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.891
I need to know everything:
Who, what, when, where, why.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.560
Before you tell me
you're not gonna talk...

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.041
You can go fuck yourself,
you know that?

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.242
You're gonna give
me what I need.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.884
Or not. You're such a fuck.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.801
Why don't you get out of here and
go fuck yourself, you motherfucker?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.082
You know who you're
dealing with, huh?

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.442
I am a cop, you moron!

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.082
I swear to God, I'll fuck...

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.088
Okay. Open it.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.568
Open the fucking wind...

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.281
Huh?

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.691
I'm Boston P.D.
I don't have a lot of time.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.368
Which means you don't have any.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.564
Look, you are in a
lot of trouble.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.286
Just let me go. Just let me go.

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.289
I'm gonna let you go.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.084
I'm gonna let you go.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.443
I'll be back. No!

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.486
Motherfucker!
Wait.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.045
Wait!

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.049
Wait!

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.169
<i>We're here to see Andri.</i>

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.610
Hey, Andri. Listen, this
location's been compromised.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.088
Get all your shit out of here.
You gotta truck it all out.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.642
The fuck I'm going to do that. And
who's this fucking piece of shit?

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.241
Pushkin made the call.
I'm just the new guy.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.847
Pushkin. Pushkin. I...

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.562
Pushkin's money. What the fuck
you give a fuck, Andri, huh?

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.205
Is that a Heckler Koch?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.209
- This?
- Yeah.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.882
What is he saying?
I don't fucking...

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.087
Can I see it? Oh, you
want to see my gun?

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.329
Uh, yes and no.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.968
- No.
- Oh, fuck!

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.329
All right, all right, all right!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.091
You're so fucking nuts!
Fuck!

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.408
All right. Everybody
settle down.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.964
Frank tells me you're
the man, Andri. Yeah?

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.845
He says your guys are
incredibly loyal toward you.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.522
If you tell them to put their
guns down, lay down on the floor,

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.444
they'll do that, won't they?

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.682
Indulge me, Andri.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.002
Tell them to lay down.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.403
There you go. Thank
you very much.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.410
There you go. Mr. Pushkin
thanks you very much.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.171
We're going out of business.
Closing down shop.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.886
Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.
There you are.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.610
Here you go. You're welcome.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.441
Accept these parting gifts on behalf of Mr.
Pushkin. There you go.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.927
Three, two... Look at
that, perfect... one.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.841
Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart.
Right around to the right.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.765
Call it in.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.496
Boston P.D. Detective
Frank Masters.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.525
I am 10-13 at 155 Warren
Street, rear entrance.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.442
Detective Frank Masters, 10-13,
155 Warren Street, rear entrance.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.924
Anything else I can do for you?
You tell me, Frank.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.320
I know you got an escape plan.
Where do you keep it?

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.370
Heh. Yeah? What's your
escape plan, huh?

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.484
Not about me. It's about you.
Where do you keep it?

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.047
Fuck you, you motherfucker.
You have fucked me

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.247
so fucking bad!

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.727
You did this!
Do you hear yourself?

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.888
You did it to this badge, Frank.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.482
You disrespected this badge.
You understand me?

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.969
Fuck you, you motherfucker.
I got nothing, all right? You hear me?

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.810
I got nothing because of you!

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.402
You think they're not coming for
you, you're not fucking next?

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.967
I am a dead man!
Do something about it.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.282
You don't know who
these people are!

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.848
I'm a fucking dead man. I
won't last a fucking week.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.809
Then do the right thing.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.569
Motherfu...

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.249
Do the right thing, Frank.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.968
Police officer for <i>22</i> years, I know you
didn't get this far and not have an out.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.801
Where do you keep it? I
was a fucking good cop.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.845
I was.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.045
I understand.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.125
Do the right thing.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.563
Do it for the good cops, Frank.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.603
Where do you keep it?

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.571
Just let me know when
you're done, detective.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.525
This guy here.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.685
He was cuffed to the pipes back here,
200,000 in the trunk of his car.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.929
Recording of the whole deal
with these guys on the seat.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.401
Crazy. And that was
tacked to his jacket.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.921
That's not the best part.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.969
We're on scene for the duration.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.050
Get IDs on all those guys.
Check this out.

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.849
Holy shit!

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.486
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.887
Who's gonna fucking count this?

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.680
We've searched <i>the city.</i>

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.211
<i>No sign of him.</i>

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.920
<i>McCall has disappeared.</i>

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.407
<i>Mr. Pushkin has been notified.</i>

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.002
My men will find him.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.291
Good.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.489
I got to piss.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.529
He's not coming back.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.006
Had enough?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.888
You certainly have my attention.
Because I can keep going.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.401
Brick by brick.
Dollar by dollar.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.251
Body by body.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.524
Or you can call your boss and tell
him to shut down his operation.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.000
Tonight.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.283
That's not much of an offer.
Only one you're gonna get.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.527
When you pray for rain, you
gotta deal with the mud too.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.884
When you look at me...

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.926
what do you see?

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.650
<i>Hm?</i>

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.527
The answer's nothing.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.884
I have no feelings about you one
way or the other. You're like...

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.324
Like lint or a bottle cap.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.761
You're just a thing to remove.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.244
I knew a Russian police
captain back in the day.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.126
He told me about a case he worked on.
Can't remember the guy's name.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.051
He was a famous scholar,
lived in Moscow.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.049
He was a humanitarian,
an author.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:18.689
Anyway, he decided to share his
abundance with someone less fortunate.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.965
And even though he had five children,
he opened his home to a sixth.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.407
An orphan, 12-year-old boy.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.523
Kid had been pounded by the
system from an early age.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.290
Troubled.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:34.006
Prone to violence. A lost cause.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.965
Stop me if you know this one.
Oh, no. Carry on.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.529
Okay. So this good man
opened his home to this boy.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.685
And when the boy stole from him,
this good man loved him anyway.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.885
When the boy failed in school, this man
showed understanding and Patience.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.483
When the boy lied and cheated
and clawed and fought,

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:59.641
this good man showed
compassion and love

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.129
until the boy, who had never felt
anything like being wanted or loved,

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.885
he finally did.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.243
The man had broken through.
It was a miracle.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.683
One week later, intruders
broke into the man's house.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.566
Killed the man and
his wife in bed.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.206
They said some small
things were stolen,

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.402
things a child might steal.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.090
No one knows for sure.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.931
The man's children were
sent off to relatives.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.964
The boy, the orphan,
shipped back to hell.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.326
Just when he finally had a chance at life,
it was snatched away by two bullets.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.327
It's a well-known story. Mm.
They ever catch who did it?

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.600
Did they?

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.007
Maybe they didn't look
in the right place.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.567
Sometimes the answer's
in front of you.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.004
I think the boy killed them.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.765
I think the boy did it.

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.407
The boy was scared his foster
parents would wake up one day

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.888
and realize he wasn't worth
it, like all the others had.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:03.881
And he couldn't bear the thought that
this good man would do that to him.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.764
Would throw him away...

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.166
like a piece of lint
or a bottle cap.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.450
So...

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.281
he decided not to find out.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.649
What do you think, Nicolai?

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.890
You think you know me?

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.851
You strike me as a
sentimental man, Mr. McCall.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.929
That's surprising.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.491
I...

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.170
I don't possess that chip.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.206
I never could understand what
comes from feeling that way

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.767
except weakness.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.726
The men I killed, your men,

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.843
I gave them a chance.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.847
They made their decision.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.525
I'm giving you the
opportunity to make yours.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.362
Thank you. You're welcome.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.524
You let me know...

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.204
when you decide.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.006
Of course.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.284
I've done some bad things
in my life, Nicolai.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.283
Things I'm not proud of.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.487
I promised someone
that I love very much

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.490
that I would never go back
to being that person.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.411
But for you...

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.763
I'm gonna make an exception.

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.805
You asked me what I saw
when I looked at you.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.802
What do you see when
you look at me?

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.576
<i>FBI. How can I direct your call?</i>

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.965
Agent Mosley, please.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.762
<i>Agent Mosley.</i> Heard you
found some money today.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.485
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.366
Concerned citizen. Check
your personal e-mail.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.726
Make sure you're sitting
down when you do.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.609
He hit my tankers. And you
tell me not to worry?

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.124
<i>That you'll take care of things?
Only I've been further embarrassed.</i>

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.971
I have a new team. It's
simply a matter of time.

01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.810
You're out of <i>time.</i>

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.367
<i>New York had to shut down.
Nothing is moving.</i>

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.487
<i>My calls aren't being answered. I've
lost tens of millions today alone.</i>

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.529
It will all be Well.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.007
<i>Stop the bleeding,
or don't come back.</i>

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.443
Go fuck yourself.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.886
- Yes?
- Mr. McCall.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.801
Nicolai.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.281
Your life for theirs. Whose?

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.046
You'll want to answer that.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.768
Yes?
Mr. McCall?

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.481
Ralphie? They came
into the store.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.729
<i>Who's with you? Jenny,
Brian, Jay and Marcus.</i>

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.729
<i>What's going on?
Wait...</i>

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.445
Oh, my God.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.171
No.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.448
<i>My men there will kill
them in 30 minutes.</i>

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.889
Unless you're here in 29.

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.411
<i>You know the place.</i>

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.251
You can still smell
the burning gasoline.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.964
He's close. Get ready.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.640
Here comes the bus.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.761
Just checking on you,
sentimental man.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.411
Yeah? You willing to
die for your friends?

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.965
<i>Are you?</i>

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.681
<i>When</i> you see him, shoot him.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.162
The bus is <i>empty.</i>

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:27.890
<i>Kill</i> one.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.840
<i>Kill one of them.</i>

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.760
You wanna be first?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.920
Where is that coming from?
I don't know.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.645
I don't know!

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.088
They're gonna kill Ralphie, yo.

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.169
They're gonna fucking kill him.

It's me, Mr. McCall.
It's Ralphie.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.802
You said not to leave
anybody behind.

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.326
Buck-ninety, my ass.

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.371
Come on.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.524
Aah!
Oh, fuck! Unh.

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.606
You all right?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.968
Aah. I've been shot.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.408
Can you walk?
Yeah.

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.811
I'm gonna need you to do something.
Look at me.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.002
Ralphie, focus. Focus. Okay.

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.763
Can you make it to
the breaker box?

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.247
Forty seconds, exactly.

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.766
Forty seconds exactly.

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.611
Shit.

01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.526

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:44.090
Shit. Oh, shit.

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.241
I'd stay in there if I were you.

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.364
Who are you?

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.164
Everybody wants to know.

02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:24.286
Gun's not there. Just
put the towel on.

02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:27.051
What do you want?

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.963
I want the head of the snake.

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:35.290
So it's you.

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.408
And now you've come to kill me.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.365
Yes.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.724
And tell me, what do you
gain from my death?

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.371
Peace.

02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.485
Peace is expensive to buy.

02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:03.926
But I can purchase it for you.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.327
What is your price?

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.851
Are you there?

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.965
Guards, guards!

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:45.326
Hey!

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.202
Hey!
Hey, Robert.

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.845
Hey.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.527
I remembered you lived around here, so
I've been swinging by the last few days.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.324
Yeah?

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.966
Yeah. Pretty different, huh?

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.645
Night and day.

02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.531
Yeah, well...

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:10.724
I get my stitches out next week.

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:13.727
Um...

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.931
I'm reading now. Oh, no.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.724
Yeah. I know. Very good.

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.369
I got it from a used book store. The guy
there recommended it to me. It's good.

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.529
I got a job too.

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.482
A real job with real
hours and stuff. Okay.

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.444
When they gave me my stuff
back at the hospital,

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:40.406
there was this envelope
with my name on it.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.168
Almost $10,000 inside

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.442
and a ticket out of town.

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.804
Probably hush money, right?

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.806
Probably.

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.491
Who cares?

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.005
A new start.

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.051
Alina the singer.

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:04.049
Someone once told me I could
be whoever I wanted to be.

02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.922
Body, mind...

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:08.451
Spirit.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.721
I'm gonna miss your stories, Robert.
You got your own now.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.531
Thank you.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.926
For everything.

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.806
I'll catch you around.

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.161
Okay.

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.800
