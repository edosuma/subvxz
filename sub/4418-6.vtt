SHOOT ME!

00:56.781 --> 00:58.414
MAKE A WISH,
GRANDPA.

00:58.416 --> 00:59.949
I WISH
I WERE DEAD!

00:59.951 --> 01:01.884
THAT'S OUR
SILLY GRANDPA.

01:01.886 --> 01:03.886
I'M NOT BEING SILLY,
KILL ME!

01:03.888 --> 01:06.055
I'D DO IT MYSELF
BUT I'M TOO DAMN OLD!

01:06.057 --> 01:08.691
WHO WANTS ICE CREAM
WITH THEIR CAKE?

01:08.693 --> 01:09.592
( Stan )
I WILL!

01:09.594 --> 01:11.761
IT'S 8:00, MY FAVORITE
TV SHOW IS ON.

01:11.763 --> 01:14.864
THAT SHOW'S FOR BABIES,
IT'S SO STUPID!

01:14.866 --> 01:17.666
CAN I EAT MY CAKE
IN THE LIVING ROOM MOM?

01:17.668 --> 01:18.300
PLEASE, CAN I?

01:18.302 --> 01:21.670
OH, ALRIGHT, BUT TAKE
YOUR GRAMPY WITH YOU.

01:21.672 --> 01:23.005
GODDAMNIT!

01:23.007 --> 01:23.639
LANGUAGE!

01:23.641 --> 01:25.975
Now back to
"Terrance and Phillip".

01:25.977 --> 01:28.477
Hey Terrance,
I think I have to fart.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.914
Wait, before you do,
pull my thumb.

01:32.049 --> 01:33.382
( farting )

01:33.384 --> 01:34.850
( laughing )

01:37.321 --> 01:37.887
( gunshot )

01:37.889 --> 01:38.754
GODDAMNIT!

01:38.756 --> 01:41.524
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MAKE A DOLLAR, BILLY?

01:41.526 --> 01:44.059
MY NAME'S NOT BILLY,
GRANDPA, IT'S STAN.

01:44.061 --> 01:46.996
DAMNIT BILLY,
DO YOU WANT A DOLLAR?!

01:46.998 --> 01:47.429
SURE.

01:47.431 --> 01:49.932
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO
ONE THING.

01:49.934 --> 01:52.001
I'M NOT GONNA
KILL YOU GRANDPA.

01:52.003 --> 01:52.601
WHY NOT?

01:52.603 --> 01:53.936
BECAUSE I'LL
GET IN TROUBLE.

01:53.938 --> 01:56.539
I KILLED MY GRANDPA
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE!

01:56.541 --> 01:58.374
LEAVE ME ALONE
GRANDPA.

01:58.376 --> 01:58.974
( farting )

01:58.976 --> 02:01.043
WHAT HAS AMERICA'S
YOUTH COME TO?!

02:01.045 --> 02:04.713
KIDS WON'T EVEN KILL
THEIR OWN GRANDPARENTS!

02:05.516 --> 02:07.616
Hey Terrance,
now that<i> you</i> farted,

02:07.618 --> 02:10.052
I think I might
fart too.

02:10.054 --> 02:11.120
( farting )

02:11.122 --> 02:13.022
You farted!

02:13.024 --> 02:14.056
( laughing )

02:14.058 --> 02:16.692
KYLE, BUBBY,
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

02:16.694 --> 02:18.994
Hey Phillip, would you
like a flower?

02:18.996 --> 02:20.462
I sure would,
Terrance.

02:20.464 --> 02:22.865
Alrighty then,
here's a tulip.

02:22.867 --> 02:23.499
( farting )

02:23.501 --> 02:25.768
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S HORRIBLE!

02:25.770 --> 02:27.703
DUDE, IT'S
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP".

02:27.705 --> 02:30.072
Take that you,
stupid dick.

02:30.074 --> 02:31.106
WHAT DID
HE SAY?

02:31.108 --> 02:33.108
You're an asshole
Phillip.

02:33.110 --> 02:35.311
WH-WH-WHAT?!

02:35.313 --> 02:35.845
YOUNG MAN,

02:35.847 --> 02:38.214
YOU ARE NOT TO WATCH
THAT SHOW ANYMORE.

02:38.216 --> 02:39.748
IT'S IMMATURE
TOILET HUMOR.

02:39.750 --> 02:42.084
BUT EVERYBODY WATCHES
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP".

02:42.086 --> 02:44.887
OH,<i> REALLY,</i>
IS THAT SO?

02:44.889 --> 02:47.389
Oh, no, Phillip looks like
you're about to fart.

02:47.391 --> 02:49.525
You're exactly
right Terrance.

02:49.527 --> 02:50.659
( farting )

02:52.830 --> 02:54.096
SWEET.

02:54.098 --> 02:54.797
ERIC, DEAR,

02:54.799 --> 02:58.167
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM YOUR
FRIEND KYLE'S MOTHER.

02:58.169 --> 03:00.669
SHE SAID THAT
THIS SHOW IS NAUGHTY

03:00.671 --> 03:03.339
AND MIGHT MAKE YOU
A POTTY-MOUTH.

03:03.341 --> 03:07.409
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP!
KYLE'S MOM IS A DIRTY JEW!

03:07.411 --> 03:09.812
OH, OKAY, HON.

03:14.285 --> 03:17.653
I'M NOT GOING
TO KILL YOU GRANDPA!

03:17.655 --> 03:18.787
INGRATE!

03:18.789 --> 03:20.155
GOOD NIGHT
GRANDPA!

03:20.157 --> 03:23.192
YOU POMPOUS
SON OF A WHORE!

03:25.162 --> 03:27.196
OW, WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?

03:27.198 --> 03:28.364
THAT'S FOR YOUR
STUPID MOTHER!

03:28.366 --> 03:31.133
SHE MADE ME MISS
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
LAST NIGHT.

03:31.135 --> 03:32.134
YEAH WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA

03:32.136 --> 03:34.169
HAVING YOUR MOM CALL
ALL OUR MOMS LAST NIGHT?

03:34.171 --> 03:36.739
I DIDN'T HAVE HER DO IT,
SHE DID IT ON HER OWN.

03:36.741 --> 03:38.173
WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN
EVERY MONTH?

03:38.175 --> 03:40.576
IT SEEMS LIKE RIGHT ABOUT
THE SAME TIME EVERY MONTH

03:40.578 --> 03:42.811
KYLE'S MOM GETS A HAIR
UP HER ASS ABOUT SOMETHING

03:42.813 --> 03:46.015
AND I ALWAYS END UP
GETTING SCREWED BY IT.

03:46.017 --> 03:46.649
CHILDREN, CHILDREN,

03:46.651 --> 03:49.285
A CERTAIN STUDENT'S MOTHER
CALLED ME LAST NIGHT.

03:49.287 --> 03:51.921
GEE, I WONDER WHO'S MOTHER
THAT COULD'VE BEEN.

03:51.923 --> 03:54.423
SHE INFORMED ME THAT
SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE WATCHING

03:54.425 --> 03:57.526
A NAUGHTY SHOW CALLED
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP".

03:57.528 --> 03:58.160
( all giggling )

03:58.162 --> 04:00.729
WATCHING THAT SHOW
IS BAD, MR. GARRISON.

04:00.731 --> 04:02.197
THAT'S RIGHT,
MR. HAT.

04:02.199 --> 04:03.899
SHOWS LIKE
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"

04:03.901 --> 04:05.367
ARE WHAT WE CALL
"TOILET HUMOR".

04:05.369 --> 04:08.337
THEY DON'T
EXPAND YOUR MINDS.

04:09.006 --> 04:11.073
YOU SEE CHILDREN,
THESE KINDS OF SHOWS

04:11.075 --> 04:12.574
ARE SENSELESS,
VILE TRASH.

04:12.576 --> 04:16.011
KENNY, WHY ARE YOU
LATE TO CLASS?

04:18.950 --> 04:20.950
OH, OKAY,
KENNY BE SEATED.

04:20.952 --> 04:22.251
NOW AS I WAS SAYING,

04:22.253 --> 04:25.020
THE REASON THE PARENTS
OF SOUTH PARK ARE SO UPSET

04:25.022 --> 04:25.921
IS BECAUSE--

04:25.923 --> 04:27.756
YES KENNY,
WHAT IS IT?

04:27.758 --> 04:28.290
( mumbling )

04:28.292 --> 04:30.526
YOU JUST CAME
FROM THE BATHROOM.

04:30.528 --> 04:31.794
( loud mumbling )

04:31.796 --> 04:33.162
OKAY, OKAY,
GO AHEAD.

04:33.164 --> 04:35.764
AS I WAS SAYING, YOU ALL
SEEM TO ENJOY THE SHOW

04:35.766 --> 04:37.666
EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T
BASED IN REALITY.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.002
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO LIFE
THAN TWO YOUNG MEN

04:40.004 --> 04:41.704
FARTING ON EACH OTHER.

04:41.706 --> 04:43.272
( loud diarrhea sounds )

04:43.274 --> 04:45.207
AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SHOWS

04:45.209 --> 04:47.142
THAT HAVE COME AND GONE
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY BAD

04:47.144 --> 04:48.978
AND USUALLY THEY GET TAKEN
RIGHT OFF THE AIR.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.280
YOU SHOULD BE SPENDING YOUR TIME
ENLIGHTENING YOUR MIND

04:51.282 --> 04:53.048
WITH MORE INTELLIGENT
ENTERTAINMENT.

04:53.050 --> 04:56.852
SMELLS LIKE YOU SLAUGHTERED
A COW IN THERE KENNY!

04:56.854 --> 04:57.853
PAY ATTENTION
CHILDREN!

04:57.855 --> 04:59.555
I'M GOING TO JOIN
YOUR PARENTS IN REQUESTING

04:59.557 --> 05:04.059
THAT YOU DON'T WATCH
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
ANYMORE EVER.

05:04.061 --> 05:04.460
WHAT?

05:04.462 --> 05:06.095
NOT WATCH IT EVER?

05:06.097 --> 05:09.431
THAT'S RIGHT CHILDREN,
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

05:09.433 --> 05:09.898
YES STANLY?

05:09.900 --> 05:12.534
IS IT OKAY TO KILL SOMEBODY
IF THEY WANT YOU TO?

05:12.536 --> 05:14.536
WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:14.538 --> 05:17.106
MY GRANDPA KEEPS ASKING THAT
I KILL HIM ALL THE TIME.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.574
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF I SHOULD.

05:18.576 --> 05:21.744
I THINK THAT A PERSON HAS
A RIGHT TO DIE IF THEY WANNA.

05:21.746 --> 05:22.277
REALLY?

05:22.279 --> 05:24.680
THERE'S THIS GUY
NAMED<i> JACK LABORKIAN</i>

05:24.682 --> 05:26.348
THAT GOES AND AND MURDERS PEOPLE
THAT ASK HIM TO.

05:26.350 --> 05:28.717
AND HE DOESN'T GET INTO
ANY TROUBLE AT ALL.

05:28.719 --> 05:29.251
WOW!

05:29.253 --> 05:32.287
MAYBE WE CAN GET<i> HIM</i>
TO KILL KYLE'S MOM.

05:32.289 --> 05:36.091
SO IS IT OKAY TO ASSISTANT
SOMEBODY WITH SUICIDE?

05:36.093 --> 05:37.092
STAN...

05:37.094 --> 05:40.462
I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT ONE
WITH A 20 FOOT POLE.

05:40.464 --> 05:41.964
( loud mumbles )

05:43.000 --> 05:45.467
( diarrhea sounds )

05:51.609 --> 05:54.376
I THINK I'M ALREADY
HAVING WITHDRAWAL.

05:54.378 --> 05:55.310
( moaning )

05:55.579 --> 05:57.746
DON'T WORRY, WE CAN ALL
WATCH IT AT MY HOUSE.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.948
MY PARENTS DON'T
GET HOME UNTIL LATE.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.884
BUT WON'T YOUR
GRANDPA BE THERE?

06:01.886 --> 06:02.317
YEAH.

06:02.319 --> 06:03.519
JUST KILL HIM
DUDE.

06:03.521 --> 06:05.220
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE YOU
SOME MONEY.

06:05.222 --> 06:06.455
HELLO THERE
CHILDREN.

06:06.457 --> 06:07.122
HEY CHEF.

06:07.124 --> 06:08.223
HOW'S IT GOING?

06:08.225 --> 06:08.724
BAD.

06:08.726 --> 06:09.324
WHY BAD?

06:09.326 --> 06:11.326
CHEF, IS IT OKAY
TO KILL YOUR GRANDPA?

06:11.328 --> 06:13.495
YOU CAN'T KILL
MY GRANDPA STAN.

06:13.497 --> 06:14.997
HE'S ALREADY
PASSED ON.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.532
NO I MEAN KILL
<i>MY</i> GRANDPA.

06:16.534 --> 06:18.600
NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S OKAY.

06:18.602 --> 06:20.769
IN FACT I THINK
THAT'S ILLEGAL.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.337
SEE, I TOLD YOU
DUDE.

06:22.339 --> 06:23.806
WHAT IF THE GRANDPA
WANTS TO DIE

06:23.808 --> 06:26.408
'CAUSE HE'S REALLY OLD AND
HE'S JUST ASKING FOR HELP?

06:26.410 --> 06:29.478
YEAH, LIKE ASSISTED SUICIDE,
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

06:29.480 --> 06:33.849
I DON'T WANNA TOUCH THAT
WITH A 40 FOOT POLE.

06:34.085 --> 06:35.484
WHAT'S THE
BIG DEAL?

06:35.486 --> 06:37.553
WHY WON'T ANYBODY
TALK ABOUT THIS?

06:37.555 --> 06:40.522
AND I MYSELF WAS NOT AWARE
OF THIS HORRIBLE SHOW

06:40.524 --> 06:41.223
UNTIL RECENTLY.

06:41.225 --> 06:43.992
I HAVE A CLIP TO DEMONSTRATE
EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

06:43.994 --> 06:45.994
Hey Phillip
guess what?

06:45.996 --> 06:46.895
What?

06:46.897 --> 06:48.330
Fart.

06:48.332 --> 06:52.234
NOW APPARENTLY THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.

06:52.236 --> 06:55.737
( laughing )
HE FARTED RIGHT ON HIS HEAD.

06:56.006 --> 06:59.408
NOT ALLOWING OUR KIDS
TO WATCH THIS SHOW

06:59.410 --> 07:00.843
IS NOT ENOUGH.

07:00.845 --> 07:04.046
WE NEED TO BOYCOTT
THE ENTIRE NETWORK!

07:04.048 --> 07:06.515
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR!

07:06.650 --> 07:09.084
( loud diarrhea )

07:09.820 --> 07:12.321
I THINK I'VE CAUGHT
A TOUCH OF THE FLU

07:12.323 --> 07:14.523
FROM LITTLE KENNY
THIS MORNING.

07:14.525 --> 07:17.526
I'VE GOT THE GREEN APPLE
SPLATTERS.

07:17.528 --> 07:19.761
( laughing )

07:23.367 --> 07:23.999
HI GRANDPA,

07:24.001 --> 07:25.901
I BROUGHT MY FRIENDS OVER
TO WATCH TV.

07:25.903 --> 07:29.271
BILLY, HELP GRANDPA STICK
THIS FORK IN THE OUTLET!

07:29.273 --> 07:31.640
NO GRANDPA,
I'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

07:31.642 --> 07:32.641
KILL ME
GODDAMNIT!

07:32.643 --> 07:34.143
NO, I CAN'T EVEN
KILL A DEER.

07:34.145 --> 07:36.278
THEN HAVE ONE OF YOUR
LITTLE FRIENDS DO IT.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.813
YOU CAN KILL ME,
CAN'T YOU?

07:37.815 --> 07:39.314
I WOULD NEVER
KILL SOMEBODY.

07:39.316 --> 07:41.150
NOT UNLESS
THEY PISSED ME OFF.

07:41.152 --> 07:42.284
IS THAT A FACT?

07:42.286 --> 07:44.520
WELL LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, PORKY,

07:44.522 --> 07:46.355
YOUR MOM WAS
OVER HERE EARLIER

07:46.357 --> 07:49.224
AND I HUMPED HER
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

07:49.226 --> 07:49.892
WHAT?!

07:49.894 --> 07:50.659
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:50.661 --> 07:53.228
AND THEN I DUG UP YOUR
GREAT GRANDMA'S SKELETON

07:53.230 --> 07:55.564
AND HAD MY WAY
WITH HER TOO.

07:55.566 --> 07:57.566
CHOICE PIECE OF ASS
YOUR GREAT GRANDMA.

07:57.568 --> 07:59.668
YOU PIECE OF CRAP,
I'LL KILL YOU!

07:59.670 --> 08:00.702
THAT'S THE
SPIRIT TUBBY!

08:00.704 --> 08:02.538
C'MON, HE'S JUST
TRYING TO GET TO YOU.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.106
DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY MOM LIKE THAT!

08:04.108 --> 08:06.175
WE CAN GO WATCH
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
IN THE KITCHEN.

08:06.177 --> 08:09.444
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
I BOOFED YOUR DAD, FATSO?

08:09.446 --> 08:11.780
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH!

08:11.782 --> 08:14.116
HERE CARTMAN,
HAVE SOME SNACKY CAKES.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.651
DUDE,
SNACKY CAKES?

08:15.653 --> 08:17.019
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, DUDE.

08:17.021 --> 08:18.287
MY GRANDPA REALLY
WANTS TO DIE.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.555
I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S OKAY.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.623
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK
THE LORD FOR GUIDANCE.

08:21.625 --> 08:22.191
HEY, YEAH.

08:22.193 --> 08:23.792
( tv )
And now back to...

08:23.794 --> 08:25.260
on South Park
Public Access.

08:25.262 --> 08:27.596
Believe in me and
ye shall find peace.

08:27.598 --> 08:29.932
First caller you're on
"Jesus and Pals".

08:29.934 --> 08:31.433
( man )
Yeah, is this Jesus?

08:31.435 --> 08:33.468
YES CALLER, YOU NEED TO
TURN YOUR TV DOWN.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.837
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GETTING
THAT WEIRD FEEDBACK.

08:35.839 --> 08:36.572
Oh, sorry.

08:36.574 --> 08:37.372
This is Martin.

08:37.374 --> 08:38.807
Martin from Aspen Park,
yes I know.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.841
How the hell'd
you know that?

08:39.843 --> 08:41.910
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M
THE SON OF GOD, BRAINIAC.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.212
NOW DO YOU
HAVE A QUESTION?

08:43.214 --> 08:47.082
Yeah, I have this cousin
who cheated on the SAT's--

08:47.084 --> 08:49.084
TELL LITTLE GREGORY
THAT CHEATING IS LYING

08:49.086 --> 08:52.054
AND LYING IS WRONG NO MATTER
WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

08:52.056 --> 08:52.554
Oh.

08:52.556 --> 08:55.190
Okay, thanks
for the advice, Jesus.

08:55.192 --> 08:57.559
NEXT CALLER,
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

08:57.561 --> 08:57.993
JESUS?

08:57.995 --> 08:58.560
Yes my son.

08:58.562 --> 09:00.829
IS IT OKAY TO KILL SOMEBODY
IF THEY ASK YOU TO

09:00.831 --> 09:02.397
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN
A LOT OF PAIN?

09:02.399 --> 09:05.734
LIKE ASSISTED SUICIDE,
IS THAT OKAY?

09:05.936 --> 09:07.169
MY SON...

09:07.171 --> 09:07.603
YES?

09:07.605 --> 09:10.038
I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT
WITH A 60 FOOT POLE.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.139
NEXT CALLER.

09:11.141 --> 09:11.940
GODDAMNIT!

09:11.942 --> 09:12.541
I HEARD THAT.

09:12.543 --> 09:13.742
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH EVERYBODY?

09:13.744 --> 09:16.578
HEY YOU GUYS,
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP" IS ON!

09:16.580 --> 09:18.714
DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET
IN TROUBLE FOR WATCHING IT?

09:18.716 --> 09:20.048
KYLE, DON'T BE
SUCH A BUTT-HOLE.

09:20.050 --> 09:22.184
YEAH, JUST 'CAUSE YOUR MOM
IS A STUPID BITCH

09:22.186 --> 09:23.619
DOESN'T MEAN THE WHOLE WORLD
HAS TO SUFFER.

09:23.621 --> 09:26.088
DON'T CALL MY MOM
A BITCH, CARTMAN!

09:26.090 --> 09:27.623
A<i> BITCH.</i>

09:27.625 --> 09:31.126
YOUR MOM
IS A<i> BITCH.</i>

09:31.128 --> 09:33.061
( tv )
And now back
to "Terrance and Phillip".

09:33.063 --> 09:35.430
Hey Phillip, would you
like to eat some beans?

09:35.432 --> 09:37.299
Oh, yeah,
I love beans!

09:37.301 --> 09:39.434
UH-OH, I BET I KNOW
WHAT'S COMING.

09:39.436 --> 09:42.971
BILLY, WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING
THIS FOR GRANDPA PLEASE?

09:42.973 --> 09:44.172
OKAY
GRANDPA OKAY,

09:44.174 --> 09:45.774
JUST GET OUT OF
THE WAY OF THE TV.

09:45.776 --> 09:46.341
Hey Phillip,

09:46.343 --> 09:48.610
it looks like those beans
might make me fart.

09:48.612 --> 09:50.245
Well don't fart
on me, terrance.

09:50.247 --> 09:53.181
DUDE, HE'S GONNA FART
ON HIS HEAD AGAIN!

09:53.183 --> 09:54.116
( loud mumbling )

09:54.118 --> 09:56.752
HEY YOU'RE GONNA
MISS IT, KENNY!

09:56.754 --> 09:57.319
( farting )

09:57.321 --> 09:59.087
You're such an
asshole Terrance!

09:59.089 --> 10:00.622
That's right
I am!

10:00.624 --> 10:03.325
( exploding diarrhea )

10:05.029 --> 10:06.728
KENNY, YOU'RE GONNA
MISS THE FART!

10:06.730 --> 10:08.664
JESUS, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

10:08.666 --> 10:11.366
WE'RE NOT WATCHING
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP",
I SWEAR.

10:11.368 --> 10:13.368
I MEAN CARTMAN
WAS WATCHING IT.

10:13.370 --> 10:15.537
NO, I MEAN
WHAT THE HELL

10:15.539 --> 10:18.106
ARE YOU DOING
TO GRANDPA?!

10:18.509 --> 10:23.011
TUG A LITTLE
HARDER, BILLY.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.012
AAH!

10:24.548 --> 10:25.113
YOU JERK!

10:25.115 --> 10:27.149
YOU WERE TRYING
TO KILL GRANDPA!

10:27.151 --> 10:29.151
I'M TELLING MOM!

10:29.153 --> 10:31.086
DAMNIT,
I WAS SO CLOSE.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.288
FOUR THIRD GRADERS
FROM SOUTH PARK, COLORADO

10:33.290 --> 10:35.691
WERE FOUND TRYING
TO VICIOUSLY MURDER

10:35.693 --> 10:37.125
AN INNOCENT
GRANDFATHER.

10:37.127 --> 10:39.428
BOYS, HOW DID YOU GET DRIVEN
SO FAR TO THE EDGE?

10:39.430 --> 10:42.297
WHAT CHANGED YOU INTO SUCH
DEMONIC LITTLE BASTARDS?

10:42.299 --> 10:43.365
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WE WERE DOING.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.801
WE WERE JUST SITTING THERE
WATCHING "TERRANCE AND PHILLIP".

10:45.803 --> 10:47.202
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP",
AH-HA!

10:47.204 --> 10:49.638
SO IT<i> IS</i> THAT SHOW
THAT IS TO BLAME.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.907
THESE BOYS MINDS
HAVE BEEN TAINTED

10:51.909 --> 10:55.210
BY THE GARBAGE ON TELEVISION
THAT THEY SEE

10:55.212 --> 10:57.879
AND WE ARE FED UP!

10:58.182 --> 10:59.381
OH, GOD,
OH, GOD!

10:59.383 --> 11:02.718
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS SMUT
FROM GOING ON THE AIR!

11:02.720 --> 11:05.887
WE WILL MARCH TO
THE NETWORK AND PROTEST

11:05.889 --> 11:08.490
UNTIL OUR DEMANDS
ARE MET.

11:08.492 --> 11:11.593
NEW YORK,
HERE WE COME!

11:12.096 --> 11:14.129
( loud diarrhea )

11:16.867 --> 11:20.402
WE ARE SPREADING THE WORD
TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT

11:20.404 --> 11:23.205
THAT WE DEMAND
BETTER TELEVISION

11:23.207 --> 11:26.007
FOR OUR CHILDREN!

11:26.243 --> 11:29.411
WE WANT MORE
QUALITY TELEVISION

11:29.413 --> 11:32.147
LIKE "FULL HOUSE"!

11:32.750 --> 11:35.617
I THINK YOU GAVE ME
THE STOMACH FLU, MR. GARRISON.

11:35.619 --> 11:39.321
IT WAS THAT LITTLE KENNY BASTARD
THAT GAVE IT TO<i> ME.</i>

11:39.323 --> 11:41.923
WHOA, MAYOR, YOU MAKING
GRAVY IN THERE?

11:41.925 --> 11:45.560
I JUST HAD
A BROWN BABY BOY.

11:46.063 --> 11:47.562
( laughing )

11:48.332 --> 11:51.166
DUDE, THIS IS SWEET
NOT HAVING PARENTS AROUND.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.202
YEAH, I HOPE THEY PROTEST
TV SHOWS FOREVER.

11:54.204 --> 11:54.903
WHOOPIE!
WHOOPIE!

11:54.905 --> 11:57.606
C'MERE BILLY, I WANNA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

11:57.608 --> 11:59.007
DO I
HAVE TO?

11:59.009 --> 12:01.209
YES, YOU DO,
YOU LITTLE PECKER!

12:01.211 --> 12:03.578
I REALIZE THAT THE REASON
YOU WON'T KILL ME

12:03.580 --> 12:07.115
IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW I FEEL BILLY.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.451
BUT NOW I FOUND A WAY
TO SHOW<i> YOU</i>

12:09.453 --> 12:12.888
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE A GRANDPA.

12:13.624 --> 12:16.191
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

12:17.594 --> 12:19.828
WHAT ARE THEY
DOING IN THERE?

12:19.830 --> 12:20.695
I DON'T KNOW.

12:20.697 --> 12:24.566
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE AS OLD AS ME.

12:24.568 --> 12:26.468
ARE YOU READY,
BILLY?

12:26.470 --> 12:27.502
I GUESS.

12:27.504 --> 12:31.006
( Enya's "Sail Away" playing )

12:38.348 --> 12:40.649
OKAY YOU CAN
LET ME OUT NOW.

12:40.651 --> 12:42.751
NOT JUST YET.

12:42.753 --> 12:44.619
LET ME OUT
GRANDPA!

12:44.621 --> 12:46.688
I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE!

12:46.690 --> 12:48.323
THIS MUSIC
IS TERRIBLE!

12:48.325 --> 12:49.858
IT'S CHEESY,
BUT LAME

12:49.860 --> 12:52.394
AND EERILY SOOTHING
AT THE SAME TIME!

12:52.396 --> 12:52.961
THAT'S IT!

12:52.963 --> 12:56.731
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO BE A GRANDPA!

12:58.569 --> 13:02.304
GRANDPA I HAD NO IDEA
HOW BAD IT WAS FOR YOU.

13:02.306 --> 13:03.805
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

13:03.807 --> 13:06.541
SO NOW WILL YOU
KILL ME BILLY?

13:06.543 --> 13:08.143
SURE I WILL
GRANDPA.

13:08.145 --> 13:09.611
I WILL.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.114
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
OUR PROTEST IS WORKING.

13:13.116 --> 13:15.016
IT'LL WORK,
IT HAS TO.

13:15.018 --> 13:17.752
( man )
LOOK, IT'S THE PRESIDENT
OF THE NETWORK.

13:17.754 --> 13:20.722
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
MY NAME IS JOHN WORSON.

13:20.724 --> 13:24.259
I'VE PREPARED A STATEMENT FOR
YOU ON BEHALF OF THE NETWORK.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.928
( clearing throat )

13:26.930 --> 13:28.930
<i>@#$$! YOU.</i>

13:28.932 --> 13:31.433
THANK YOU
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.668
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS
YOU MAY DIRECT THEM

13:33.670 --> 13:36.137
TO THAT BRICK WALL
OVER THERE.

13:36.139 --> 13:40.342
HEY, YOU WILL NOT
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

13:40.944 --> 13:43.144
( crowd gasping )

13:44.114 --> 13:45.013
THAT DOES IT!

13:45.015 --> 13:47.616
NO MORE
MR. NICE PROTESTERS!

13:47.618 --> 13:50.819
IT'S TIME
FOR PLAN B.

13:51.121 --> 13:54.256
CAROL, WHERE ARE
THE PORTA-POTTIES?

13:54.258 --> 13:54.990
OVER THERE HON.

13:54.992 --> 13:58.293
WHY, DO YOU NEED TO DROP
SOME FRIENDS OFF AT THE POOL?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.395
OH, YES
INDEEDY.

14:00.397 --> 14:02.097
( laughing )

14:02.366 --> 14:05.267
OKAY, GRANDPA, ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS SIT THERE.

14:05.269 --> 14:06.234
WE'LL DO THE REST.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.103
YOU GOT THE COW
ALL TIED UP?

14:08.105 --> 14:09.070
YEP ALL DONE.

14:09.072 --> 14:11.573
OKAY,
C'MON GUYS.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.175
WHY DON'T
WE JUST SHOOT HIM?

14:14.177 --> 14:15.210
YOU DUMB-ASS
CARTMAN.

14:15.212 --> 14:17.946
IT HAS TO LOOK NATURAL
OR ELSE WE'LL GET BUSTED.

14:17.948 --> 14:19.347
YEAH
STUPID.

14:19.349 --> 14:23.351
THAT'S GOOD BILLY,
A LITTLE HIGHER NOW.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.821
THE NETWORK IS NOT
TAKING US SERIOUSLY.

14:26.823 --> 14:29.958
IN THE PAST PEOPLE
HAVE HAD TO DIE

14:29.960 --> 14:31.693
FOR WHAT THEY
BELIEVED IN.

14:31.695 --> 14:34.629
AND WE ARE PREPARED
TO DO THE SAME!

14:34.631 --> 14:36.031
READY?

14:36.033 --> 14:40.468
MR. McCORMIC YOU SHALL BE
A MARTYR TO US ALL.

14:40.470 --> 14:44.973
WE WILL NOT LET
THESE CORPORATE HALF-WITS

14:44.975 --> 14:48.176
RUIN OUR
CHILDREN'S MINDS!

14:48.178 --> 14:50.278
LAUNCH!

14:52.983 --> 14:53.615
( gasping )

14:53.617 --> 14:56.851
WE WILL ALL FOLLOW SUIT
ONE BY ONE

14:56.853 --> 14:58.954
IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES!

14:58.956 --> 15:00.755
( moaning in pain )

15:00.757 --> 15:02.023
ARE YOU READY
GRANDPA?

15:02.025 --> 15:04.659
DOES THE POPE
CRAP IN THE WOODS?

15:06.363 --> 15:08.163
( police radio )

15:14.304 --> 15:16.137
CARRY ON.

15:16.139 --> 15:17.405
OKAY
HERE WE GO.

15:17.407 --> 15:20.008
BYE GRANDPA, IT WAS
NICE KNOWING YOU.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.611
CUT THE DAMN ROPE
ALREADY!

15:23.447 --> 15:25.313
WHAT IS THAT?

15:25.315 --> 15:28.483
IT LOOKS
LIKE DEATH!

15:29.720 --> 15:31.286
IT'S ABOUT TIME,

15:31.288 --> 15:33.254
YOU LAZY-ASS
SON OF A WHORE!

15:33.256 --> 15:36.124
C'MON LET'S GO!

15:36.126 --> 15:37.025
WHAT THE--?

15:37.027 --> 15:39.260
HEY, HE'S COMING
TOWARDS<i> US.</i>

15:39.262 --> 15:42.263
( Cartman )
WHY IS DEATH
COMING AFTER<i> US</i>?

15:42.265 --> 15:44.099
( children screaming )

15:44.101 --> 15:46.334
AAH...!

15:47.938 --> 15:48.737
HELP!

15:48.739 --> 15:50.872
RUN, RUN, RUN!

15:52.275 --> 15:54.843
WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

15:54.845 --> 15:55.977
AS THE DAY
PROGRESSES

15:55.979 --> 15:57.912
MORE AND MORE
SOUTH PARK RESIDENTS

15:57.914 --> 15:59.814
CONTINUE TO SLINGSHOT
THEIR BODIES

15:59.816 --> 16:02.450
INTO THE SIDE OF
THE TOON CENTRAL BUILDING.

16:02.452 --> 16:05.420
TOON CENTRAL IS NOW UNDER
INCREDIBLE PRESSURE

16:05.422 --> 16:06.287
TO CANCEL THE SHOW

16:06.289 --> 16:09.791
AND HAS ALREADY LOST OVER
20 PERCENT OF THEIR SPONSORS.

16:09.793 --> 16:12.394
HERE CAROL,
I THINK IT'S YOUR BOY.

16:12.396 --> 16:13.395
OH, THANKS.

16:13.397 --> 16:14.896
WHAT IS IT
STANLEY, HON?

16:14.898 --> 16:16.865
DID YOU
BREAK SOMETHING?

16:16.867 --> 16:17.565
MOM, DEATH IS HERE

16:17.567 --> 16:19.734
AND HE'S TRYING TO
TAKE US AWAY WITH HIM!

16:19.736 --> 16:22.303
STANLEY, YOU NEED
TO LEAVE MOMMY ALONE.

16:22.305 --> 16:24.472
I'M DOING SOMETHING
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

16:24.474 --> 16:26.474
FOR YOUR LITTLE
WELL BEING THERE.

16:26.476 --> 16:27.542
( Stan )
Yeah but Mom--!

16:27.544 --> 16:29.010
HERE HONEY,
TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

16:29.012 --> 16:30.445
DID YOU TURN
THE HEAT DOWN?

16:30.447 --> 16:31.546
Dad, Death is coming!

16:31.548 --> 16:33.114
KEEP THE THERMOSTAT
UNDER 70.

16:33.116 --> 16:35.150
TAKE CARE OF
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

16:37.087 --> 16:37.652
DAMNIT!

16:37.654 --> 16:39.154
IF PARENTS
SPENT LESS TIME

16:39.156 --> 16:40.455
WORRYING ABOUT WHAT
THEIR KIDS WATCH ON TV

16:40.457 --> 16:43.258
AND MORE TIME WORRYING
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THEIR KIDS' LIVES

16:43.260 --> 16:45.026
THIS WORLD WOULD BE
A MUCH BETTER PLACE.

16:45.028 --> 16:47.028
YEAH I THINK THAT PARENTS
ONLY GET SO OFFENDED

16:47.030 --> 16:49.064
BY TELEVISION BECAUSE THEY
RELY ON IT AS A BABY-SITTER

16:49.066 --> 16:51.533
AND THE SOLE EDUCATOR
OF THEIR KIDS.

16:51.535 --> 16:53.334
( mumbling )

17:01.511 --> 17:03.144
TOTALLY DUDE.

17:03.780 --> 17:04.412
AAH!

17:04.414 --> 17:07.148
QUICK, JUMP THROUGH
THE WINDOW!

17:12.155 --> 17:12.654
AAH...!

17:12.656 --> 17:16.825
COME BACK HERE,
YOU SON OF A PANSY!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.727
DON'T LET HIM
TOUCH YOU.

17:18.729 --> 17:20.428
YOU DIE IF
HE TOUCHES YOU!

17:20.430 --> 17:23.998
COME OVER HERE,
YOU SON OF A WHORE!

17:28.038 --> 17:29.771
Oh, Terrance.

17:29.773 --> 17:31.539
What color
is the wind?

17:31.541 --> 17:35.243
Hmm, I don't know,
why don't you check?

17:35.245 --> 17:36.177
( farting )

17:36.179 --> 17:38.513
You farted!

17:38.515 --> 17:40.148
( laughing )

17:41.184 --> 17:42.183
Hey Phillip,

17:42.185 --> 17:44.219
you know what my
spacesuit smells like?

17:44.221 --> 17:46.254
No Terrance,
why don't you tell me?

17:46.256 --> 17:49.624
Well, it smells like
a dirty fart.

17:49.626 --> 17:51.392
( laughing )

17:51.595 --> 17:54.229
HEY LOOK!

17:55.198 --> 17:57.766
Oh, there's one!

17:57.768 --> 17:59.167
( laughing )

18:00.237 --> 18:01.236
HOURS HAVE PAST

18:01.238 --> 18:02.604
AND STILL THE DIE-HARD
SOUTH PARK PARENTS

18:02.606 --> 18:05.907
ARE KILLING THEMSELVES IN FRONT
OF THE TOON CENTRAL BUILDING

18:05.909 --> 18:07.509
ONE BY ONE.

18:07.511 --> 18:08.176
WORSE YET,

18:08.178 --> 18:11.646
THE STOMACH FLU THAT SEEMS TO BE
GOING AROUND IS...

18:11.648 --> 18:12.180
WAIT, WAIT,

18:12.182 --> 18:14.582
I'M GETTING WORD THAT
THE PRESIDENT OF THE NETWORK

18:14.584 --> 18:17.352
IS GOING TO MAKE
A STATEMENT.

18:17.821 --> 18:19.354
WAIT, WAIT.

18:19.356 --> 18:20.588
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

18:20.590 --> 18:23.691
YOUR NAZI-ASS TACTICS
OF TRYING TO STINK US OUT

18:23.693 --> 18:25.927
WITH YOUR RANCID FECES...

18:25.929 --> 18:27.962
HAS WORKED.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.533
THEREFORE TODAY WE WILL
OFFICIALLY BE TAKING

18:31.535 --> 18:33.401
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
OFF THE NETWORK

18:33.403 --> 18:36.704
AND REPLACING IT WITH RERUNS OF
"SHE'S THE SHERIFF",

18:36.706 --> 18:38.606
STARRING
SUZANNNE SOMERS.

18:38.608 --> 18:39.207
( applause )

18:39.209 --> 18:43.378
GET AWAY FROM HERE AND
TAKE YOUR DIARRHEA WITH YOU!

18:46.249 --> 18:50.084
NOW AT LAST WE CAN
RETURN TO NORMALITY.

18:50.086 --> 18:50.652
Hey, Phillip.

18:50.654 --> 18:51.619
Yes, Terrance?

18:51.621 --> 18:53.655
Is there a penny
stuck in my butt?

18:53.657 --> 18:56.191
I don't know, Terrance,
let me check.

18:56.193 --> 19:00.628
UH-OH, DON'T LOOK PHILLIP,
YOU'RE GONNA GET FARTED ON.

19:00.630 --> 19:05.533
We interrupt this program
to bring you loud static.

19:08.338 --> 19:10.205
( groaning )

19:10.207 --> 19:11.005
AAH!

19:12.609 --> 19:14.843
OH, MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY!

19:14.845 --> 19:15.944
YOU BASTARD!

19:15.946 --> 19:19.581
I GUESS DEATH WAS COMING
AFTER KENNY THE WHOLE TIME.

19:19.583 --> 19:22.650
HEY, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO KILL<i> ME</i>!

19:22.652 --> 19:25.353
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
GODDAMNIT!

19:25.355 --> 19:29.390
MY GRANDPA ASKED ME
TO KILL HIM AND I DID IT!

19:32.295 --> 19:33.328
WHOA!

19:33.330 --> 19:36.865
BILLY...

19:37.467 --> 19:38.399
GRANDPA?

19:38.401 --> 19:39.734
THAT'S RIGHT
BILLY.

19:39.736 --> 19:41.102
MY NAME'S NOT
BILLY, GRANDPA.

19:41.104 --> 19:44.205
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
WHY DO YOU LOOK ALL HAGGARD?

19:44.207 --> 19:46.708
I ASKED YOU
TO KILL ME, BILLY.

19:46.710 --> 19:47.809
BUT I WAS WRONG,

19:47.811 --> 19:51.713
AND NOW I'M FORCED TO
SPEND ETERNITY IN LIMBO.

19:51.715 --> 19:52.280
"LIMBO"?

19:52.282 --> 19:54.616
I WAS WRONG TO PUT YOU
IN THAT POSITION.

19:54.618 --> 19:58.586
JUST LIKE YOU'RE WRONG TO PUT
LITTLE BILLY IN IT NOW.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.688
YOU'RE SO OBSESSED
WITH ENDING YOUR LIFE

20:00.690 --> 20:03.458
YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO<i> HIS.</i>

20:03.460 --> 20:07.295
YOU MUST WAIT TO DIE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

20:07.297 --> 20:09.297
BUT I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR 25 YEARS!

20:09.299 --> 20:13.935
LET NATURE RUN ITS COURSE
OR ELSE END UP IN LIMBO!

20:13.937 --> 20:16.371
NATURAL CAUSES, BILLY.

20:16.373 --> 20:19.841
NATURAL CAUSES...

20:22.846 --> 20:25.246
C'MON YOU GUYS,
LET'S GO HOME.

20:32.255 --> 20:33.922
HERE THEY ARE.

20:33.924 --> 20:34.756
WELL,
WE DID IT SON.

20:34.758 --> 20:37.325
WE FOUGHT A BATTLE FOR
YOUR WELL-BEING AND WON.

20:37.327 --> 20:37.992
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:37.994 --> 20:40.995
WE GOT "TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
TAKEN OFF THE AIR.

20:40.997 --> 20:43.531
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH,
YOUR MOM SUCKS!

20:43.533 --> 20:46.100
BUT LOOK
WHAT THEY PUT ON.

20:46.169 --> 20:49.737
And now back to
"She's the Sheriff".

20:49.739 --> 20:50.405
NO!

20:50.407 --> 20:51.272
GOD, NO!

20:51.274 --> 20:53.908
You were the one behind
all the shenanigans.

20:53.910 --> 20:56.811
Yeah well you're the
stupid 'ho that started it.

20:56.813 --> 20:58.446
WHAT DID HE SAY?

20:58.448 --> 21:00.548
Up yours,
butt-munch!

21:00.550 --> 21:01.516
WH-WH-WHAT?!

21:01.518 --> 21:04.585
C'MON EVERYBODY,
BACK TO NEW YORK!

21:04.587 --> 21:07.588
NOW THAT "TERRANCE AND PHILLIP"
HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AIR,

21:07.590 --> 21:09.257
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
FOR ENTERTAINMENT?

21:09.259 --> 21:12.226
I DON'T KNOW, WE CAN START
BREATHING GAS FUMES.

21:12.228 --> 21:14.929
MY UNCLE SAYS THAT
SMOKING CRACK IS KINDA COOL.

21:14.931 --> 21:18.166
WHY DON'T WE WATCH SOME OF
THOSE PORNO MOVIE THINGIES?

21:18.168 --> 21:18.766
COOL!

21:18.768 --> 21:19.233
YEAH!

21:19.235 --> 21:21.202
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING GRANDPA?

21:21.204 --> 21:23.271
I'M PLANNING
A TRIP TO AFRICA.

21:23.273 --> 21:26.307
DID YOU KNOW OVER 400 PEOPLE
ARE EATEN NATURALLY

21:26.309 --> 21:29.010
BY LIONS IN AFRICA
EVERY YEAR?

21:29.012 --> 21:31.579
THAT'S MY
SILLY GRANDPA.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.081
( laughing )
