52:54.797 --> 52:56.173
happily taking photos
and like,

52:56.256 --> 52:58.133
"You're on <i>Strike Back,</i>
yeah." (CHUCKLES)

52:58.217 --> 52:59.885
Anyone who doesn't run,
that's the target.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.178
‐(GUNSHOTS)
‐(CROWD SCREAMS)

53:01.428 --> 53:03.639
It all kicked off in the center
that was a bit like

53:03.722 --> 53:05.140
doing <i>Strike Back</i> the live play,

53:05.224 --> 53:06.975
<i>in the middle of the street,</i>
<i>which was cool.</i>

53:07.059 --> 53:08.060
Move! Get back!

53:08.310 --> 53:10.187
We'd be running past them
and they're all cheering.

53:10.729 --> 53:11.980
I think we made the papers
and everything.

53:12.064 --> 53:13.065
So, that was pretty funny.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.567
‐It worked, didn't it?
‐Yeah.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.489
MACPHERSON: <i>Novin and I go</i>
<i>and do a pretty routine,</i>

53:20.572 --> 53:22.157
check around the house,
and looking for clues,

53:22.241 --> 53:24.410
<i>and trying to find a trail,</i>
<i>and work out where to head next.</i>

53:24.493 --> 53:29.289
And a massive dude
with a massive machine gun

53:29.373 --> 53:30.332
<i>comes kicking in the door</i>

53:30.708 --> 53:33.210
<i>and we had a fire fight</i>
<i>in a two‐bedroom apartment.</i>

53:34.128 --> 53:35.879
<i>We've got a great</i>
<i>special‐effects department.</i>

53:35.963 --> 53:38.590
One of the most valuable parts
of this department

53:38.841 --> 53:43.595
are the guys with paintball guns
firing pellets of spikes at you.

53:45.639 --> 53:46.515
Shit!

53:46.974 --> 53:50.018
So, I had all of the shelving
of glasses and things like that,

53:50.102 --> 53:54.356
and Kiki, on the paintball gun,
firing paintballs at my head,

53:54.440 --> 53:55.941
smashing glass everywhere.

53:56.024 --> 53:58.318
<i>We'll explode anything,</i>
<i>while trying to have a gun fight</i>

53:58.402 --> 54:00.279
with this guy who decided
just to...

54:00.654 --> 54:03.991
throw a grenade in at the end,
and we blew all the windows out.

54:05.492 --> 54:06.785
<i>Then I did a quick getaway.</i>

54:07.703 --> 54:09.204
<i>We scared the neighbors</i>
<i>here in Zagreb,</i>

54:09.288 --> 54:11.123
but it's just another day
on <i>Strike Back.</i>

54:11.373 --> 54:13.917
♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪

54:15.210 --> 54:18.130
For a covert team,
we blow a lot of shit up.

54:18.422 --> 54:19.465
(CHUCKLES)
