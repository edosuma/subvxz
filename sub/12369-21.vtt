HOW CAN I HELP YOU, JOY?

10:33.632 --> 10:37.720
- DR. GREENLY,
GIVEN MY HISTORY WITH MEN,

10:37.803 --> 10:40.514
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DATE
MY FORMER THERAPIST?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.559
- I DO.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.978
WOW, THAT GUY SEEMED
REALLY SMART.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.857
- JOY, COULD I SEE YOU
IN THE KITCHEN?

10:49.940 --> 10:53.194
- RIGHT NOW?
- YES, RIGHT N-N-N-NOW.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.573
- I NEVER HOSTED A WAKE BEFORE.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.575
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THESE THINGS GENERALLY GO?

10:59.658 --> 11:00.910
- OH, NOT LONG.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.578
PEOPLE SHOULD START
TO DRIFT OUT

11:02.661 --> 11:06.123
SOON AFTER YOU GIVE
THE EULOGY.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.917
- THE SHOCKS ARE GETTING WORSE.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.544
- I CAN'T GET IT OFF.
THE LATCH IS BROKEN.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.089
- GUESS WHO'S GIVING
THE EULOGY.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.423
- SERIOUSLY?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.300
- YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE
THE EULOGY?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.968
- I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT,

11:18.052 --> 11:19.678
BUT HIS FAMILY IS SO BORING.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.431
YOU ZONE OUT, AND WHEN
THEIR MOUTHS STOP MOVING,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
YOU JUST NOD YOUR HEAD.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.810
- SO NOW SAY NO.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.937
- I CAN'T.
JASON IS DEPENDING ON ME.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.606
- WHO'S JASON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.109
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.444
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
BUT IF I DON'T GET
THIS THING OFF SOON,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.573
YOU'RE GONNA BE GIVING
MY EULOGY.

11:39.657 --> 11:43.119
- SEE, YOUR EULOGY
WOULD BE FUN TO WRITE.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.621
I HAVE GENUINE FEELINGS
FOR YOU.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.331
HARRY'S FAMILY IS EXPECTING

11:47.415 --> 11:48.874
A GRIEVING FIANCEE EULOGY,

11:48.958 --> 11:52.795
AND THE TRUTH IS
I BARELY KNEW THE MAN.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.838
WHY DO I SMELL POPCORN?

11:53.921 --> 11:55.673
- I TRIED TO GET THIS THING OFF

11:55.756 --> 11:58.426
BY BUTTERING MYSELF,
AND NOW I'M COOKING.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.809
- SO AS A PROFESSIONAL
YOU WOULDN'T DATE ME

12:06.892 --> 12:08.269
IF I WAS REALLY SCREWED UP,
WOULD YOU?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.813
- STOP FISHING.

12:10.896 --> 12:11.981
[cell phone chimes]

12:12.064 --> 12:14.316
- SORRY.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.861
OOF. IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S MY MOTHER.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.779
- AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
LIKE DR. GREENLY,

12:18.863 --> 12:20.448
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOTHING,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.700
IT'S OFTEN BECAUSE YOU'RE
AVOIDING SOMETHING.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.743
- ISN'T IT SOMETIMES HEALTHY

12:24.827 --> 12:27.204
TO AVOID SOMETHING YOU KNOW
IS GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BAD?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.956
- NOT IF IT KEEPS YOU
IN DENIAL.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.792
- LOOK, I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS,

12:31.876 --> 12:34.003
BUT I'VE DEALT WITH IT.
I'M FINE.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.713
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
BEING AT A FUNERAL RIGHT NOW

12:35.796 --> 12:38.340
ISN'T TRIGGERING
ANYTHING FOR YOU?

12:38.424 --> 12:43.471
- LOOK, IF DR. GREENLY
KEEPS ASKING QUESTIONS,

12:43.554 --> 12:48.142
JOHN IS NOT GONNA GET LUCKY
TONIGHT.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.852
- TONIGHT?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.520
LOOK, I JUST BROUGHT
DR. GREENLY

12:51.604 --> 12:54.023
'CAUSE HE'S A FRIEND
OF MY SISTER'S.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.903
- TECH SUPPORT
PUT ME ON HOLD AGAIN.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.280
- OKAY, LISTEN,
HERE'S WHAT I HAVE SO FAR.

13:01.363 --> 13:05.367
WEBSTER'S DEFINES EULOGY
AS A SPEECH IN PRAISE

13:05.451 --> 13:07.828
OR HONOR OF A DECEASED PERSON.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.372
- WEBSTER'S DEFINES DULL
AS ANY SPEECH

13:10.456 --> 13:12.708
WHICH STARTS
WITH "WEBSTER'S DEFINES."

13:12.791 --> 13:14.210
YES, YES, TECH SUPPORT.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.420
I'M STILL HERE.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.714
NO, I ALREADY TRIED
BUTTERING MYSELF.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.511
YES, THIS IS MRS. LADYPANTS.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.263
NO, I AM NOT GOING
RIGHT N-N-N-NOW.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.769
- HEY, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE ROASTING

13:31.852 --> 13:33.187
YOUR 100-YEAR-OLD FRIEND.

13:33.270 --> 13:37.399
- THEY SAID OUR MATERIAL
WAS TOO RAUNCHY.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.736
- ONE ZINGER
ABOUT CRAIG'S LOW-HANGING FRUIT,

13:40.819 --> 13:43.572
AND THEY FREAK.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.535
- NOW WE HAVE
ALL THIS KILLER MATERIAL

13:47.618 --> 13:49.870
AND NOWHERE TO SHOWCASE IT.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.957
- WHAT'S THE CROWD LIKE
OUT THERE?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.124
- DON'T YOU DARE!

13:54.208 --> 13:55.459
IT'S A WAKE.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.379
- MELANIE, JASON IS HERE.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.256
IT'S TIME TO GIVE
THE EULOGY, SWEETIE.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.423
- OH, GOOD,
JASON'S HERE.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.259
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.971
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO GO OUT THERE
AND DISAPPOINT THEM ALL.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.639
EVEN JASON.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.767
WHOEVER THE [bleep] THAT IS!

14:15.479 --> 14:18.732
- FOR THOSE OF YOU
I HAVEN'T MET, I'M JASON.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.985
I WANT TO THANK MELANIE
FOR HOSTING THIS SPECIAL NIGHT

14:21.068 --> 14:22.778
AND FOR GRACIOUSLY ALLOWING ME
TO SPEAK BEFORE HER.

14:22.861 --> 14:28.409
- OR, IF YOU LIKE,
INSTEAD OF ME.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.995
- WHAT A CHARACTER.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.288
NO WONDER DAD LOVED YOU.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.457
- DAD.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.044
YOU KNOW, RELATIONSHIPS
WITH FATHERS CAN BE COMPLICATED.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.338
- ARE YOU OKAY?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.798
- I'M FINE.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.800
- HE WAS MY COMPASS,

14:44.883 --> 14:46.176
MY TRUE NORTH.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.721
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT,
IF I COULD FIND HIM,

14:48.804 --> 14:50.556
I COULD FIND MY WAY.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.099
AND LAST WEEK WHEN HE ASKED ME

14:52.182 --> 14:53.559
TO BE THE BEST MAN
AT HIS WEDDING,

14:53.642 --> 14:56.270
I WAS SO HAPPY
BECAUSE--

14:56.353 --> 14:58.856
BECAUSE HE WAS THE BEST MAN
THAT I HAD EVER KNOWN.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.111
CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M NEVER GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.155
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

15:06.238 --> 15:10.326
- JOHN, I NEED YOU
TO BE DR. GREENLY AGAIN.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.577
- LET'S TALK.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.871
- AND NOW MELANIE
WILL GIVE THE EULOGY,

15:13.954 --> 15:15.331
AND GET YOUR HANDKERCHIEFS
READY.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.960
DAD TOLD ME
SHE HAS THE SOUL OF A POET.

15:26.091 --> 15:31.764
- WEBSTER'S DEFINES EULOGY--
- [screams]

15:33.807 --> 15:37.645
JUST LETTING OUT THE GRIEF.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.567
YOU'LL JUST EXCUSE ME.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.283
- OH, THANK GOD
YOU CAUGHT ON FIRE.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.368
YOU SAVED ME.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.828
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.706
- SERIOUSLY, NOW I HAVE
TO FOLLOW THAT SPEECH?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
I'M IN AGONY.
- OH, REALLY, MELANIE?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.169
AGONY?
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

16:02.252 --> 16:04.713
FRESH-COOKED HAMBURGER?
STEAK ON THE GRILL?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.383
NO, IT'S MY FLESH!

16:07.466 --> 16:10.052
- CALM DOWN.
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.347
THERE.
- OH, THANK GOD.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.057
HEY, DO I LOOK MORE TONED?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.850
NEVER MIND.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.061
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
PEOPLE BUY THESE THINGS.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.730
I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS YOU
CAN'T GET FIT WITHOUT EXERCISE.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.900
- IT IS THE NUMBER ONE
EXERCISE BELT IN JAPAN.

16:24.983 --> 16:27.569
AND, WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS,
PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE DREAM.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.029
AND THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THAT.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.114
- SO YOU'RE
STILL GONNA ENDORSE IT?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.573
- WELL, OF COURSE.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.866
I MEAN, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG

16:32.950 --> 16:34.910
WITH TELLING PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR

16:34.993 --> 16:36.370
IF IT MAKES THEM HAPPY.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.747
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.251
ACTUALLY, YOU ARE RIGHT.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.045
- I AGREE.
BUT WHY?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.756
- THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WANT TO BELIEVE

16:47.840 --> 16:49.925
THAT HARRY DIED HAPPY
BECAUSE OF ME.

16:50.008 --> 16:53.387
AND I HAVE TO TELL THEM
WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

16:53.470 --> 16:57.099
YOU DID A LOT OF EULOGIES
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

16:57.182 --> 16:58.434
ARE THERE ANY THAT MIGHT FIT?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.228
- HMM.
LET ME SEE.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.941
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO A SISTER
IS NEVER EASY,

17:06.023 --> 17:10.820
EVEN IF SHE WAS MY EVIL TWIN.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.281
NO.
ALPHONSE WILL ALWAYS BE

17:13.365 --> 17:16.660
A PART OF ALL OF US BECAUSE
WE HAD TO EAT HIM TO SURVIVE.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.496
OH, I THINK
THAT'S CLOSER.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.207
- HEY, JOY.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.041
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

17:24.126 --> 17:27.628
- I WAS OUT BACK
WITH DR. GREENLY.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.133
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.635
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.013
- OH, JOY.
- HONEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

17:36.096 --> 17:38.098
- HE TOOK OFF
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.142
AND NOT A WORD SINCE.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.144
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET SYMPATHY
FOR FEELINGS

17:42.227 --> 17:45.814
I WASN'T FEELING
OR DIDN'T WANT TO FEEL.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.984
THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER'S
BEEN CALLING.

17:49.067 --> 17:52.029
HE LEFT ME SOMETHING.
ONLY, I'M NOT SURE I WANT IT.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.908
BUT LISTENING TO JASON
TALK ABOUT HIS FATHER

17:55.991 --> 17:59.828
WITH SUCH LOVE...
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS FANTASY

17:59.912 --> 18:04.124
THAT SOME DAY MY DAD AND I WOULD
SOMEHOW MAGICALLY RECONNECT

18:04.208 --> 18:08.170
AND HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP
I ALWAYS WANTED.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.131
THEN IT JUST HIT ME.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.550
THAT CAN NEVER HAPPEN NOW.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.515
THAT FANTASY DIED WITH HIM.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.850
- AH, HONEY,
THAT'S HARD.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.187
- SO DR. GREENLY TOLD ME
TO WRITE DOWN

18:25.270 --> 18:26.688
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO HIM.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.524
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU WRITE?

18:28.607 --> 18:33.237
- "DEAR DAD,
I'M ANGRY.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.198
"I'M ANGRY
THAT YOU'RE NOT HERE.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.574
"I'M ANGRY THAT YOU LEFT ME

18:37.658 --> 18:39.535
"BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE
TO BE EVERYTHING

18:39.618 --> 18:42.329
WE COULD BE TO EACH OTHER..."

18:42.412 --> 18:45.999
- "BUT MOSTLY I'M ANGRY
THAT THE DREAMS I HAD

18:46.083 --> 18:48.794
"FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL NEVER COME TRUE.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.046
"I CAN ONLY CONSOLE MYSELF

18:51.129 --> 18:53.382
"WITH THE FEW MEMORIES
I DO HAVE--

18:53.465 --> 18:55.884
"YOUR RICH, BOOMING LAUGH,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.594
"AFTER DINNER
SITTING ON YOUR LAP,

18:57.678 --> 19:01.390
THE HINT OF WHISKEY
ON YOUR BRE..."

19:03.475 --> 19:07.396
- HE DID LOVE HIS WHISKEY.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.068
- "THERE IS SO MUCH
I'LL NEVER GET TO SAY TO YOU.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.404
"BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I MISS YOU

19:15.487 --> 19:17.364
"MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

19:17.447 --> 19:21.618
I LOVE YOU, DADDY."

19:21.702 --> 19:25.080
I CALLED HIM DADDY.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.749
BUT NOT IN THE CREEPY WAY.
IN THE SEXY WAY.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.169
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, "WHO'S YOUR DADDY?"

19:33.172 --> 19:39.094
YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE,
SOMEHOW,

19:39.177 --> 19:42.681
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE MAN

19:42.764 --> 19:46.727
THIS SPEECH WAS WRITTEN FOR
HAS HEARD THESE WORDS

19:46.810 --> 19:50.230
AND HE IS SMILING DOWN
AT HIS GIRL.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.485
- "DEAREST REJOYLA,

19:55.569 --> 19:57.946
"I HOPE THIS PORTRAIT
WILL SERVE AS A REMINDER

19:58.030 --> 20:00.991
"THAT EVEN THOUGH HE MAY NOT
HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN IT,

20:01.074 --> 20:03.952
"YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.663
"I DO HOPE THIS GIVES YOU
SOME HAPPINESS AND PEACE.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.915
LOVE, MUM."

20:07.998 --> 20:10.000
- AW, THAT'S SWEET.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.754
- "P.S. NOW THAT
YOUR PSYCHIC WOUNDS HAVE HEALED,

20:13.837 --> 20:15.213
PERHAPS YOU CAN FIND A MAN."

20:19.676 --> 20:22.346
- OH.
- OHH.

20:22.429 --> 20:26.600
- HE EVEN MADE YOUR HANDS
PROPORTIONATE TO YOUR BODY.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.314
CLEARLY HE CARED.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.359
- HE REALLY DID.
