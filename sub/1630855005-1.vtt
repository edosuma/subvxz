00:20.965 --> 00:24.896
♪ Oh, I'll make you better

00:24.896 --> 00:29.000
I don't do this a lot.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.275
Neither do I.

00:33.482 --> 00:36.620
So, have you been
doing all right?

00:36.620 --> 00:37.896
I'm sorry, that was
a silly question.

00:37.896 --> 00:38.758
Of course not.

00:38.758 --> 00:40.379
No, it's okay.

00:41.896 --> 00:43.655
I've been fine, all
things considered.

00:45.482 --> 00:47.551
Of course, it's hard with
two daughters, and...

00:49.758 --> 00:51.344
I still miss him.

00:51.344 --> 00:54.068
It still feels like a
dream that he's dead.

00:54.068 --> 00:55.620
You probably don't
wanna talk about this now.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.448
It's actually kind of
nice to talk about it.

00:58.448 --> 01:02.034
It's been over a year, and
no one even says his name.

01:02.034 --> 01:03.655
So...

01:03.655 --> 01:05.310
Wish I knew him
better, you know?

01:05.310 --> 01:06.827
I wish I got to know you better.

01:06.827 --> 01:09.620
I mean, we barely spoke
in high school, right?

01:09.620 --> 01:11.068
Yeah.

01:11.068 --> 01:12.551
Crazy how we bumped
into each other.

01:12.551 --> 01:14.620
Well, you two probably
would've been friends.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.137
Mm.

01:16.137 --> 01:17.724
Yeah, he was a
really great guy.

01:19.310 --> 01:22.137
An amazing husband,
a wonderful father.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.379
Wow.

01:28.655 --> 01:33.172
You know, my mom
died a few years ago,

01:34.862 --> 01:38.655
my father before that, so I
know what you're going through.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.310
Yeah.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.862
This is probably
a heavy conversation

01:42.862 --> 01:44.103
for a first date, right?

01:46.068 --> 01:47.103
Just a little.

01:48.413 --> 01:50.344
So I'll see you at
church on Sunday, right?

01:50.344 --> 01:51.172
Yes.

01:54.137 --> 01:57.793
But I've got a babysitter
until midnight.

01:59.655 --> 02:01.275
Oh, okay.

02:01.275 --> 02:04.689
So guess that means I
get to hang out with you

02:04.689 --> 02:05.862

and I stay for a while?

03:21.275 --> 03:22.793
Girl, I have had enough.

03:22.793 --> 03:24.413
I can't do this anymore.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.758
Okay, I will.

03:40.930 --> 03:41.930
Maya, please.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.172
Nope.

03:43.172 --> 03:44.172
Don't wanna hear it.

03:44.172 --> 03:45.482
I can fix this.

03:45.482 --> 03:46.827
Ian, I have had enough.

03:47.793 --> 03:48.965
I'm done.

03:49.689 --> 03:51.206
Maya, I'm not the only
one who's fallen apart.

03:51.206 --> 03:52.724
You've fallen apart too.

03:52.724 --> 03:54.448
You've struggled and
I've helped you, baby,

03:54.448 --> 03:55.724
I've helped you get through it.

03:55.724 --> 03:56.793
Are you gonna
go there with me?

03:58.344 --> 04:01.034
I was depressed because
I lost my husband,

04:01.034 --> 04:02.862
but I got my life together.

04:02.862 --> 04:05.827
You, on the other hand,
can't seem to do that.

04:05.827 --> 04:06.827
Baby, all right,
look, look, look.

04:06.827 --> 04:09.000
I just need a little
more time, okay?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.172
I'll go to the program.

04:10.172 --> 04:11.000
I'll go get help, baby.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.068
I want to be better.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.517
I just need a little more time.

04:13.517 --> 04:16.172
I told you I am done.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.586
What part don't you understand?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.896
Baby, look, I, I love you.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.103
I love you, and I
love your kids, baby.

04:24.103 --> 04:25.413
Look at me.

04:26.275 --> 04:27.965
Baby, I want to be
a real family, okay?

04:27.965 --> 04:31.413
There's nothing more that I
want than a real family, okay?

04:31.413 --> 04:32.931
I'm, I'm going to
go to the program.

04:32.931 --> 04:33.896
I'm going to get help.

04:33.896 --> 04:34.655
Baby, look at me.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.793
One more chance, that's it.

04:37.793 --> 04:40.448
Ian, you have
had enough chances.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.724
What else do you want from me?

04:42.724 --> 04:45.275
How many do you
want me to give you?

04:45.275 --> 04:47.586
I have trust you, you
have violated my trust.

04:47.586 --> 04:48.620
What do you want from me?

04:48.620 --> 04:50.517
Baby, just one more, okay?

04:57.344 --> 05:01.275
So, I was waiting
for the right moment.

05:01.275 --> 05:02.448
The right moment never came,

05:02.448 --> 05:05.724
so, you know, that's
all, that's all my fault.

05:07.413 --> 05:09.034
Love you so much.

05:10.482 --> 05:12.965
I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

05:14.137 --> 05:17.000
Maya, I'll go get help, I'll
do whatever I need to do,

05:17.000 --> 05:18.379
but I can't lose you.

05:19.172 --> 05:23.275
I can't.

05:23.275 --> 05:26.896
Baby, I am no good without you.

05:30.344 --> 05:31.655
I'm no good alone, baby.

05:33.413 --> 05:35.827
We've been through
so much, so much.

05:37.413 --> 05:39.034
Baby, please don't
give up on me now.

05:42.931 --> 05:43.724
Please.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.724
You don't make me regret this.

05:53.310 --> 05:54.620
One more chance.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.586
But you have to promise me,

06:00.586 --> 06:03.827
promise me no more drinking
and no more gambling.

06:03.827 --> 06:04.793
I mean it.

06:05.827 --> 06:06.620
Okay.

06:08.827 --> 06:09.793
I'm serious.

06:27.724 --> 06:29.000
Mama.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.310
Mama?

06:30.310 --> 06:31.379
Mama!

06:31.379 --> 06:32.724
Oh, God, baby.

06:33.965 --> 06:35.000
What's wrong?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.517
You wouldn't wake up.

06:37.413 --> 06:38.724
Oh, Mommy's so sorry.

06:39.724 --> 06:41.034
I must have overslept again.

06:42.965 --> 06:44.655
Look, why don't
you head downstairs

06:44.655 --> 06:46.620
and I'll meet you
in a minute, yeah?

06:47.896 --> 06:48.724
Can I have a kiss?

06:52.137 --> 06:53.896
You got on my favorite PJs.

06:59.655 --> 07:00.551
Ow.

07:04.241 --> 07:05.068
Ow.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.620
Noelle, Grace!

07:15.206 --> 07:16.862
Maya.

07:16.862 --> 07:20.068
Oh my God, Ian, you scared me.

07:20.068 --> 07:21.586
What are you doing home?

07:21.586 --> 07:22.758
I left work early.

07:22.758 --> 07:24.103
I decided to take a shower here.

07:24.103 --> 07:25.896
What, what are you doing?

07:25.896 --> 07:28.000
I don't know, what does
it look like I'm doing?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.413
It looks like you've lost it.

07:30.413 --> 07:31.689
Funny.

07:31.689 --> 07:33.620
No, the nanny starts today,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.620
so I figured a little extra
security couldn't hurt.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.655
You know, since Mama's going
back to work full time,

07:39.655 --> 07:41.620
she needs to keep an
eye on her babies.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.793
I get that, but, baby,
you worry too much.

07:45.793 --> 07:47.655
All right?

07:47.655 --> 07:49.482
Come on now, you stay with
a cop, you live with a cop.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.896
Not to mention the sexiest
cop in the district.

07:51.896 --> 07:54.206
Oh my God.

07:54.206 --> 07:55.586
I'm all the security you need.

07:55.586 --> 07:57.310
Girl, what do you
think she's gonna pull?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.482
Well, first of all, she
was the only nanny available,

07:59.482 --> 08:01.206
so that's telling you a lot.

08:01.206 --> 08:05.103
And I've never left a
stranger with the kids before.

08:05.103 --> 08:06.620
Right, I get that,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.379
but you're still
worrying too much.

08:08.379 --> 08:11.344
And that looks a little creepy.

08:11.344 --> 08:12.965
That doesn't look creepy.

08:12.965 --> 08:14.448
Baby, that, that's
a little creepy.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.103
Can you take it down, please?

08:16.103 --> 08:17.206
Fine.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.000
Thanks.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.551
God.

08:27.551 --> 08:29.000
Look, I'm, I'm gonna
go change, okay?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.206
All right.

08:30.206 --> 08:31.724
And promise me one thing?

08:31.724 --> 08:33.517
No more weird stuff, at
least while I'm gone.

08:33.517 --> 08:34.688
It wasn't weird.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.758
No, that was pretty weird.

08:37.136 --> 08:39.413
My wife.

08:39.413 --> 08:40.586
I'll be back.

09:35.827 --> 09:38.689
Hey, and here is the kitchen.

09:38.689 --> 09:40.758
Oh, nice.

09:40.758 --> 09:44.275
And here we have
Noelle, and this is Grace.

09:44.275 --> 09:46.206
Hi, girls.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.827
Hey, Ian.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.172
Ian, this is Elle.

09:52.172 --> 09:53.206
Elle, Ian.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.241
The new babysitter.

09:54.241 --> 09:55.344
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.655
Nice to meet you.

09:56.655 --> 09:57.758
Have we met before?

09:57.758 --> 09:59.586
I mean, you look familiar.

09:59.586 --> 10:01.517
I don't think we've met,

10:01.517 --> 10:04.275
but Maya gave me
the full rundown.

10:04.275 --> 10:05.379
You have a beautiful home.

10:06.517 --> 10:07.310
Thank you.

10:08.827 --> 10:10.862
What's their usual
bedtime routine?

10:10.862 --> 10:12.551
Anything you want me to do?

10:12.551 --> 10:14.103
We don't usually
start bedtime stuff

10:14.103 --> 10:16.862
for another hour or
two, but if you want,

10:16.862 --> 10:18.275
you can go with the
girls to their room

10:18.275 --> 10:20.379
and you guys can get
to know each other.

10:20.379 --> 10:21.827
- Okay.
- Yeah?

10:21.827 --> 10:22.931
All right, girls,
what do you say?

10:22.931 --> 10:23.724
You wanna show me your room?

10:23.724 --> 10:25.275
Yeah.

10:25.275 --> 10:27.206
Noelle and Grace,
such beautiful names.

10:27.206 --> 10:28.000
All right.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.724
How's your day?

10:32.724 --> 10:35.379
Oh, don't you mean
how was my morning?

10:37.034 --> 10:39.034
I've been so exhausted lately

10:39.034 --> 10:40.827
that I slept through a
meeting with the principal.

10:40.827 --> 10:42.379
Maybe you shouldn't go in now.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.172
Honey.

10:45.172 --> 10:47.413
Look, we agreed that when
the girls were of age,

10:47.413 --> 10:48.896
I would go back to work.

10:49.896 --> 10:52.103
You said that you
were okay with that.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.482
I know, baby,

10:53.482 --> 10:55.172
but sometimes I think you put
too much pressure on yourself.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.068
You just need to take
it one day at a time.

10:59.689 --> 11:00.896
Maybe you're right.

11:02.310 --> 11:03.379
How's work going?

11:03.379 --> 11:04.793
Mm.

11:04.793 --> 11:06.793
I talked to the Chief today.

11:08.241 --> 11:09.827
And?

11:09.827 --> 11:12.724
And they are promoting
your boy to Lieutenant.

11:12.724 --> 11:15.896
Finally.

11:15.896 --> 11:19.724
Oh, baby.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.241
You know, it's
not settled yet.

11:21.241 --> 11:23.000
They still have to push
through some paperwork

11:23.000 --> 11:25.241
and everything, but
it's safe to say

11:25.241 --> 11:28.000
that I will be on my best
behavior for the next few weeks.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.724
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.517
Oh, boy.

11:32.517 --> 11:35.310
Well, I guess we gotta have
something a little fancier

11:35.310 --> 11:38.689
than nuggets to celebrate
that big promotion.

11:38.689 --> 11:41.068
And I could think of
one way to celebrate.

11:42.689 --> 11:46.793
That's right, I have the
perfect present in mind.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.793
A little prince.

11:49.344 --> 11:50.931
A son to carry my name.

11:50.931 --> 11:53.862
Baby, I told you I
am done with diapers.

11:53.862 --> 11:56.137
I have a career that I love
that I wanna get back to,

11:56.137 --> 11:59.034
and here you are trying to
keep me barefoot and pregnant?

11:59.896 --> 12:01.310
Would you stop it?

12:01.310 --> 12:02.310
Call me Lieutenant.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.793
No, no, no, no.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.103
Have you been drinking?

12:09.310 --> 12:10.827
Oh, gosh.

12:11.620 --> 12:12.931
Come on, baby,

12:12.931 --> 12:14.758
it was just one drink with
the guys to celebrate.

12:14.758 --> 12:17.000
And look, now it's our
turn to celebrate, okay?

12:17.000 --> 12:17.655
No.

12:17.655 --> 12:18.724
- Just one drink.
- No.

12:18.724 --> 12:19.965
- Just one.
- No, Ian.

12:19.965 --> 12:22.862
We know how this thing
goes, it's a cycle.

12:22.862 --> 12:24.965
One drink goes to the
next, goes to the next,

12:24.965 --> 12:27.000
and here we are
back at square one.

12:28.068 --> 12:30.413
Baby, you have a big
promotion on the line.

12:30.413 --> 12:31.965
You can't jeopardize it.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.482
Okay.

12:37.551 --> 12:39.344
All right, I'm, I'm sorry.

12:40.172 --> 12:42.517
We just have to find a
safer way to celebrate.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.034
Baby, I already told you.

12:45.034 --> 12:47.275
I can think of another
way we can celebrate.

12:47.275 --> 12:50.241
Come on.

12:50.241 --> 12:51.793
Please.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.379
Oh, baby.

12:56.379 --> 12:58.103
Baby, grab a condom.

12:59.206 --> 13:03.413
Ian, honey, come on,
please, grab a condom.

13:10.517 --> 13:12.344
You're betting again?

13:13.724 --> 13:17.172
Oh God, I can't believe you.

13:18.413 --> 13:19.793
Baby.

13:19.793 --> 13:24.586
♪ Baby, we both just
lit the candle ♪

13:26.206 --> 13:30.965
♪ Place it up, that's
when it's stable ♪

13:32.034 --> 13:36.344
♪ I know the stakes are high

13:37.931 --> 13:42.206
♪ All is fair in
love and strife ♪

13:42.724 --> 13:44.206
♪ Come

14:27.655 --> 14:30.000
Oh, coffee's ready.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.275
Thanks, Elle.

14:34.965 --> 14:36.000
Morning.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.172
Good morning.

14:38.172 --> 14:38.965
Hey.

14:40.344 --> 14:42.000
I gotta make a call
with the principal.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.206
I thought you slept
through that meeting.

14:44.206 --> 14:47.275
Mm-hmm, but he was
very understanding
and we rescheduled.

14:47.275 --> 14:49.137
Well, that was nice of him.

14:49.137 --> 14:51.931
Look, I might be late
coming home tonight.

14:51.931 --> 14:54.034
They have me out on
patrol all week, okay?

14:54.034 --> 14:55.206
All right.

14:55.206 --> 14:56.620
So, I'll see you later.

14:56.620 --> 14:57.413
Okay, I'll see
you later, babe.

14:57.413 --> 14:58.620
Have a good day.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.206
Oh, I can only take one cup.

15:00.206 --> 15:02.379
I can't be late when
I'm up for a promotion.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.275
A promotion?

15:03.275 --> 15:05.344
Well, that's wonderful.

15:05.344 --> 15:07.241
I'll be Lieutenant
any day now.

15:08.689 --> 15:10.862
Well, maybe I shouldn't
get my hopes up too high

15:10.862 --> 15:12.344
until it's official, but...

15:12.344 --> 15:14.275
I'm sure you're gonna get it.

15:14.275 --> 15:16.896
Maya told me you've been at the
station for, what, 10 years?

15:16.896 --> 15:17.827
Right?

15:17.827 --> 15:19.344
Yeah.

15:19.344 --> 15:20.896
You're like a local hero.

15:20.896 --> 15:22.413
Give me too much credit, Elle.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.344
I gotta get out here.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.931
All right?

15:29.931 --> 15:31.068
Welcome to the family.

15:37.586 --> 15:39.448
Grabbed your mail again.

15:39.448 --> 15:41.551
They really should put
the boxes further apart.

15:41.551 --> 15:43.000
Thank you.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.344
So you have company over?

15:45.896 --> 15:48.827
Yeah, new nanny,
my wife's idea.

15:48.827 --> 15:51.241
Quite the looker, for a nanny.

15:53.379 --> 15:55.172
Have a good day, Mr. Stocklan.

16:17.413 --> 16:21.586
The cab's on its way, so
I'm having a little pre-drink.

16:21.586 --> 16:23.758
Girl, of course I don't
drink in front of Ian.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.379
I've got a secret bottle stashed
away for special occasions.

16:32.724 --> 16:34.068
All right, see you soon.

16:37.000 --> 16:37.758
Who was that?

16:40.551 --> 16:41.931
That was Megan.

16:41.931 --> 16:43.482
Oh.

16:43.482 --> 16:45.413
Oh, honey, I'm
so sorry, I just-

16:45.413 --> 16:46.965
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, babe.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.448
Listen, I made
dinner reservations

16:48.448 --> 16:50.586
at your favorite
restaurant tonight.

16:50.586 --> 16:53.172
But, honey, I told you
I was going out tonight.

16:53.172 --> 16:55.655
Baby, I know, but I just
wanted to surprise you.

16:55.655 --> 16:58.068
Look, I'm tired of the
rift between us, all right?

16:58.068 --> 16:59.586
And you'd be happy to know

16:59.586 --> 17:01.517
that I'm meeting with my
sponsor in the morning.

17:03.344 --> 17:05.378
Baby, I just wanna be perfect
for you, for the family.

17:05.378 --> 17:07.034
Honey, that is so sweet,

17:07.034 --> 17:08.964
but can we do this
tomorrow night instead?

17:08.964 --> 17:10.862
No, baby, come on.

17:10.862 --> 17:12.482
Look, I just wanna spend a
little more time with you

17:12.482 --> 17:14.378
before you go back
to work, all right?

17:16.310 --> 17:18.413
Listen, we still have
a chance, all right?

17:18.413 --> 17:23.137
You've been tired lately, and
baby, I never get to see you.

17:23.137 --> 17:25.205
So I wanna see you tonight.

17:25.205 --> 17:27.550
The point is, I promised
Megan that I would go.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.310
Okay, so what I'm hearing is
that you'd rather spend time

17:31.310 --> 17:33.000
with your little friends than
stay home with me, right?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.413
What, are you trying
to avoid me, Maya?

17:34.413 --> 17:36.482
I'm not trying to avoid you.

17:36.482 --> 17:38.000
Really?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.137
We never spend
any time together.

17:39.137 --> 17:41.310
No, because every time we do,

17:41.310 --> 17:43.965
all you wanna talk
about is having a son.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.965
Honey, I have told
you a million times

17:45.965 --> 17:48.206
that I don't want another baby,

17:48.206 --> 17:50.379
especially not with
someone who keeps on lying

17:50.379 --> 17:51.827
about their drinking
and gambling.

17:51.827 --> 17:54.482
Look, Ian, you are an addict.

17:54.482 --> 17:56.310
So what you're saying is
you'll have another child,

17:56.310 --> 17:58.310
just not by me, right?

17:58.310 --> 18:00.344
Honey, that's not
what I'm saying.

18:00.344 --> 18:03.206
I'm trying to say that I don't
want another kid, period.

18:03.206 --> 18:05.068
But what about me, Maya?

18:05.068 --> 18:06.310
Huh?

18:06.310 --> 18:07.724
Why do I never get a say?

18:07.724 --> 18:09.275
You're always telling
me what to do,

18:09.275 --> 18:10.758
but you never listen
to what I want.

18:10.758 --> 18:13.448
Ian, I am not trying
to tell you what to do.

18:13.448 --> 18:15.413
I'm just asking you
to stop drinking

18:15.413 --> 18:18.241
and gambling our savings away.

18:18.241 --> 18:20.310
And if you think that's
me being controlling,

18:20.310 --> 18:23.758
then I'm sorry to say it,
babe, but you're delusional.

18:23.758 --> 18:26.517
You don't get to
speak to me like that.

18:26.517 --> 18:27.862
Calm down.

18:27.862 --> 18:29.517
I'm going out.

18:29.517 --> 18:30.413
Let me!

18:30.413 --> 18:32.068
I'm your husband.

18:32.068 --> 18:34.586
You don't get to just walk out.

18:36.689 --> 18:37.448
Ian.

18:38.965 --> 18:42.137
We can talk about this tomorrow.

18:42.137 --> 18:42.931
Please.

18:46.241 --> 18:48.413
You know what?

18:48.413 --> 18:49.241
Fine.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.172
Do what you want.

18:57.586 --> 18:58.413
Oh.

20:01.655 --> 20:02.482
Oh, baby.

20:04.896 --> 20:07.482
Looks like your friends
are gonna miss you tonight.

20:27.758 --> 20:28.655
Oh my God.

23:19.344 --> 23:21.344
All right, what happened?

23:21.344 --> 23:23.172
Man, I left my
phone in the office.

23:23.172 --> 23:24.965
Gotta go back inside.

23:24.965 --> 23:26.551
All right.

23:26.551 --> 23:27.344
I'll wait for you, huh?

23:27.344 --> 23:28.896
All right.

23:38.827 --> 23:41.344
Hey, I'm Liz, Deputy Chief.

23:41.344 --> 23:42.758
Hi.

23:42.758 --> 23:44.379
Do you need help
with something?

23:44.379 --> 23:46.206
I was hoping that
someone can help me out

23:46.206 --> 23:49.241
with this situation that I-

23:49.241 --> 23:50.000
Maya.

23:51.241 --> 23:52.034
Hey.

23:56.000 --> 23:56.793
Hey, baby.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.034
What are you doing here?

24:02.034 --> 24:05.413
I thought you were
on patrol today.

24:05.413 --> 24:07.241
I was, but I
left my phone here.

24:09.103 --> 24:10.137
I'm sorry.

24:10.137 --> 24:13.068
I know how much you hate
being a traffic cop.

24:13.068 --> 24:17.862
Oh, I know you've
been forgetting your lunch

24:18.448 --> 24:19.896
a lot lately,

24:19.896 --> 24:22.620
so I decided I would bring
you something just in case.

24:24.517 --> 24:25.724
Thank you, baby.

24:25.724 --> 24:27.689
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

24:27.689 --> 24:29.206
Wait, wait, wait.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.482
Are you sure you're doing okay?

24:30.482 --> 24:32.000
Yes, honey, I'm fine.

24:34.862 --> 24:36.000
Wait here.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.931
It's nice to meet you.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.931
Ian talks very highly of you.

24:48.931 --> 24:50.068
Thanks.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.172
That's sweet of you,
bringing him his lunch.

24:56.241 --> 24:57.206
It's no big deal.

24:57.206 --> 24:58.517
Yeah.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.103
My phone number.

25:05.482 --> 25:07.586
In case you ever need it.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.586
Are you sure you're all right?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.448
Baby, I'm just going to
go ahead and take you home.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.655
Chief said it's all good.

25:17.655 --> 25:18.931
He's gonna send
someone else out.

25:18.931 --> 25:20.758
Honey, I told you
that's not necessary.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.448
I'm just going
over to the store.

25:22.448 --> 25:24.655
Baby, it's no big
deal, all right?

25:24.655 --> 25:26.931
Besides, that's for the best.

25:27.758 --> 25:29.586
You look a little tired anyway.

25:31.275 --> 25:32.862
I'm gonna go change, all right?

25:32.862 --> 25:34.517
Chief'll keep you company.

25:34.517 --> 25:35.931
His daughter's in
the music class.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.655
What you over there doing?

25:45.655 --> 25:46.965
You reading?

25:46.965 --> 25:47.758
Yeah.

25:58.931 --> 26:01.344
Was there something else
you wanted to show me?

26:01.344 --> 26:02.310
Come, come.

26:03.965 --> 26:06.206
Oh, okay you want me
to see something else?

26:06.206 --> 26:07.379
Let's go, all right.

26:10.448 --> 26:13.517
Oh, what do you want me to see?

26:13.517 --> 26:15.551
Can we play with my dolls?

26:15.551 --> 26:16.758
Your dolls?

26:18.034 --> 26:19.172
Of course we can
play with your dolls.

26:19.172 --> 26:20.275
Is that your doll house?

26:20.275 --> 26:21.034
Yeah.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.310
Show me how you like
to play with your dolls.

26:31.620 --> 26:34.275
All right, I'll be right
back, sweetheart, okay?

26:34.275 --> 26:35.827
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.172
Stay right here, okay?

27:13.896 --> 27:15.068
What about your car?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.896
I'll bike in tomorrow
and pick it up.

27:21.103 --> 27:22.827
What were you doing there, Maya?

27:24.448 --> 27:26.448
Can't a wife do something
nice for her husband?

27:42.448 --> 27:44.068
No, seriously, what do
you think you were doing,

27:44.068 --> 27:45.827
just showing up at
my work like that?

27:48.137 --> 27:51.034
You know, I've just been
anxious lately and I missed you.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.241
You know, sometimes
you forget your lunch,

27:55.241 --> 27:57.206
so I figured I'd bring
something by the station.

27:58.655 --> 28:01.103
Elle's home with the kids, so...

28:04.689 --> 28:06.206
Ian, I'm sorry about yesterday.

28:08.068 --> 28:10.379
You were right, we don't
spend enough time together,

28:10.379 --> 28:11.965
just the two of us.

28:15.241 --> 28:16.793
It's okay.

28:16.793 --> 28:18.103
You sure that's everything?

28:19.896 --> 28:21.379
I talked to the principal

28:21.379 --> 28:24.172
and he said there
may not be a budget

28:25.724 --> 28:27.103
to where they can hire
me back full-time.

28:28.137 --> 28:29.827
In fact, they may be getting rid

28:29.827 --> 28:32.482
of the music program
altogether, so...

28:34.068 --> 28:35.689
You know how bad I've
wanted this, Ian.

28:35.689 --> 28:38.000
I was just, I was upset.

28:39.827 --> 28:42.103
But I knew you were the
person to cheer me on.

28:46.137 --> 28:48.000
Baby, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.551
Wait, I thought your meeting

28:51.551 --> 28:53.103
with the principal
was yesterday.

28:58.137 --> 29:02.862
Yeah, but I let
them borrow my music stand,

29:02.862 --> 29:04.517
so I had to go back
and pick it up.

29:10.827 --> 29:13.586
Would you mind stopping
at the grocery store?

29:13.586 --> 29:16.241
Elle said she needed a few
things for dinner tonight.

29:17.551 --> 29:19.000
Can stop by there later.

29:19.931 --> 29:21.862
Don't worry about that.

29:25.206 --> 29:26.000
Hi.

29:27.689 --> 29:29.413
Hi, little lady.

29:29.413 --> 29:32.758
I'll be back downstairs
in a second, okay?

29:32.758 --> 29:33.551
What you doing?

29:36.103 --> 29:40.551
I'm planning a surprise
for your mommy and daddy.

29:40.551 --> 29:44.482
They're gonna be really happy
about it, okay?

29:44.482 --> 29:46.034
They're gonna be so happy.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.482
But you have to keep
it between me and you,

29:47.482 --> 29:48.896
just for a little bit, okay?

29:48.896 --> 29:50.620
You can't tell
them I was in here.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.275
A surprise?

29:53.551 --> 29:56.206
Yeah, like a surprise party!

29:56.206 --> 29:57.068
Right?

29:58.413 --> 30:02.586
So, this is our
little secret, okay?

30:06.206 --> 30:06.965
Noelle?

30:06.965 --> 30:09.034
Is that me?

30:09.034 --> 30:10.965
Can I, let me see, let
me see if that's you.

30:10.965 --> 30:12.379
Hold on, let, can I see it?

30:12.379 --> 30:13.689
Give it back, Noelle.

30:13.689 --> 30:14.689
Give it back.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.620
Noelle, let me, okay.

30:16.620 --> 30:17.413
Noelle.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.241
This isn't funny, Noelle.

30:21.241 --> 30:24.586
Give it back.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.517
Ow, you're hurting me!

30:27.689 --> 30:29.517
Give it back, I need it.

30:29.517 --> 30:30.344
I need that back.

30:35.379 --> 30:35.965
Come here, I'm sorry.

30:35.965 --> 30:37.586
Are you okay?

30:37.586 --> 30:38.379
You okay?

30:39.931 --> 30:41.379
I gotta get back to work.

30:42.586 --> 30:43.586
Babe, you need to rest.

30:43.586 --> 30:45.068
You seem a little off.

30:45.068 --> 30:46.137
I know, but if they
keep the program,

30:46.137 --> 30:47.344
I've got a lesson plan due.

30:48.862 --> 30:49.965
You wanna go play?

30:50.758 --> 30:51.793
Yeah, you do.

30:51.793 --> 30:53.379
Come on, let's go.

30:53.379 --> 30:54.620
Let's go play.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.896
Remember I showed you that?

30:55.896 --> 30:56.896
Let's go play.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.172
Elle, girls.

30:59.793 --> 31:00.965
We need to talk.

31:00.965 --> 31:02.206
Ian, I am busy.

31:02.206 --> 31:04.172
Babe, we need to talk now.

31:04.172 --> 31:06.310
God, do you not
understand what busy means?

31:06.310 --> 31:08.275
But you have to promise me.

31:08.275 --> 31:11.586
Come on, pinky promise
that you won't say anything

31:11.586 --> 31:12.655
to mommy or daddy.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.241
We don't want daddy
to get mad, right?

31:17.103 --> 31:18.655
All right, promise.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.310
I promise.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.137
Nice.

31:23.758 --> 31:24.517
What's this?

31:34.103 --> 31:35.620
Who did you show this to?

31:35.620 --> 31:36.586
I didn't show it to anyone.

31:41.310 --> 31:42.758
What is wrong with you, Maya?

31:42.758 --> 31:43.931
What's wrong with me?

31:45.655 --> 31:47.068
What happened last night, Ian?

31:48.965 --> 31:51.517
You wanna tell me why I've
been sleeping so much?

31:51.517 --> 31:55.275
Why I have no idea how I
got into the bed last night?

31:55.275 --> 31:58.448
I know that you put
something in my drink.

31:58.448 --> 32:01.172
If you show that to someone,
you will destroy our family.

32:01.172 --> 32:04.137
You have already
destroyed our family!

32:05.862 --> 32:08.172
With all of the gambling and
the drinking and now this?

32:08.172 --> 32:10.034
You didn't give
me a choice, Maya.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.034
You're being selfish.

32:13.034 --> 32:15.310
I've adopted your kids
and what did I get, huh?

32:16.827 --> 32:19.689
You know how much I want a son.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.206
A family, baby,

32:21.206 --> 32:22.275
a son to be able to
pass something down to,

32:22.275 --> 32:24.000
just like my dad did for me.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.206
That's exactly what
this world needs.

32:27.620 --> 32:30.068
Another drunk trying to
deal with his demons.

32:31.448 --> 32:33.379
I thought you were
different, Ian.

32:33.379 --> 32:38.000
What you have done to me,
what you have done to my kids?

32:38.862 --> 32:40.206
I just want a son.

32:42.172 --> 32:43.758
A perfect family, baby.

32:43.758 --> 32:44.517
Don't touch me.

32:52.068 --> 32:54.827
Hello, I'd like to
report a disturbance.

32:54.827 --> 32:56.206
You disgust me.

32:57.862 --> 32:59.689
Wait, what did you say?

32:59.689 --> 33:01.172
You think you're the only one

33:01.172 --> 33:03.000
to be able to
gather up evidence?

33:03.000 --> 33:06.586
What if the wrong things ended
up in your purse or your car?

33:06.586 --> 33:09.827
Or maybe in your system
because of a drug-laced drink.

33:09.827 --> 33:11.068
Huh?

33:11.068 --> 33:13.413
I am going to be a lieutenant.

33:15.310 --> 33:17.137
And baby, you already know
the influence that I have,

33:17.137 --> 33:18.586
the people that I know.

33:18.586 --> 33:19.896
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

33:19.896 --> 33:21.310
We're married, Maya.

33:21.310 --> 33:22.931
And I'll have
custody of the kids

33:22.931 --> 33:24.413
if anything was
to happen to you.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.689
And then maybe then
I'll find a real woman

33:27.689 --> 33:30.206
who can gimme the family
that I need, that I deserve.

33:31.275 --> 33:32.551
Baby, if you try to run,

33:34.827 --> 33:35.724
I'll find you.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.551
You remember what
happened last time, right?

33:39.551 --> 33:41.413
Cops pulled you over

33:41.413 --> 33:44.206
and they brought you right
back home to me, to Daddy.

33:48.620 --> 33:49.896
You know it could have ended
up very differently though,

33:49.896 --> 33:50.724
right?

33:52.758 --> 33:55.241
You will never escape me, Maya.

33:56.413 --> 33:57.206
Ever.

33:58.827 --> 33:59.758
My reach is too long.

34:07.655 --> 34:08.482
This right here?

34:09.793 --> 34:10.655
This is your problem

34:13.482 --> 34:15.137
because you're always
holding on to things

34:15.137 --> 34:16.275
that haunt our family.

34:27.724 --> 34:30.275
He was a better man
than you will ever be.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.447
I thank God every day that those
kids are his and not yours.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.103
I hate you.

34:40.172 --> 34:41.206
I want my son.

35:17.137 --> 35:18.172
Ian.

35:20.689 --> 35:22.206
Mommy!

35:22.206 --> 35:23.862
Oh, hey, baby, hey.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.034
Is everything okay?

35:27.034 --> 35:28.068
Yeah, yeah.

35:28.068 --> 35:30.206
Maya just broke a glass.

35:30.206 --> 35:32.103
So, baby, watch your foot.

35:32.103 --> 35:33.793
It's okay, baby,
everything's fine.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.068
Why don't you take
Noelle back outside

35:37.068 --> 35:39.137
while we clean up in here?

35:39.137 --> 35:39.931
Where's Grace?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.379
She's in her room.

35:42.379 --> 35:43.931
You want me to go get her?

35:43.931 --> 35:45.827
No, no, no, I'll take her.

35:45.827 --> 35:47.862
I'll grab Grace too, 'cause I
gotta go to the store anyways.

35:47.862 --> 35:49.551
I'll help clean up.

35:49.551 --> 35:51.034
Let's let Maya clear her head.

35:51.034 --> 35:52.689
No, no, Noelle can go.

35:54.206 --> 35:56.137
Grace can stay right
here where she is.

35:56.137 --> 35:57.172
Here with Daddy.

35:58.551 --> 36:01.482
Okay, I'll stay and
give Grace her bath.

36:23.275 --> 36:24.275
What's going on over here?

36:24.275 --> 36:26.103
Is everything all right?

37:52.758 --> 37:54.379
Hernandez, you
know there's a reason

37:54.379 --> 37:56.000
why they refer to
it as a call in.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.758
I'm not calling you in.

37:57.758 --> 38:00.000
We received a call from
one of your neighbors.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.482
Something about a disturbance.

38:03.137 --> 38:05.034
You know, me and Maya,
we just had a little spat.

38:06.275 --> 38:07.310
I mean, you know how it is.

38:07.310 --> 38:08.103
No, I don't.

38:09.482 --> 38:10.482
Can I come in?

38:21.241 --> 38:23.103
So, where is Maya?

38:24.344 --> 38:25.896
That's your wife's name, right?

38:25.896 --> 38:27.068
She went to the store.

38:27.068 --> 38:28.931
Is this really necessary?

38:28.931 --> 38:31.034
We have to follow through
with any calls we receive.

38:32.241 --> 38:33.379
You know that.

38:36.103 --> 38:37.689
Liz, Liz.

38:37.689 --> 38:39.965
Always doing
everything by the book.

38:39.965 --> 38:40.793
That's me.

38:45.000 --> 38:45.793
This way.

38:49.103 --> 38:50.586
Liz, this is our nanny, Elle.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.517
Oh.

38:53.517 --> 38:55.689
Are you here to chat with
the soon to be Lieutenant?

38:55.689 --> 38:58.413
I wanted to talk
to Maya actually.

38:58.413 --> 39:00.241
Do you know when she'll be back?

39:00.241 --> 39:01.379
No idea.

39:01.379 --> 39:02.448
Sorry.

39:03.310 --> 39:05.413
Is there a problem?

39:05.413 --> 39:07.206
One of the neighbors called,

39:07.206 --> 39:08.793
probably heard the scream
when Maya dropped the glass.

39:08.793 --> 39:10.310
You know how clumsy she can be.

39:10.310 --> 39:11.379
Glass?

39:11.379 --> 39:13.482
Right, the glass.

39:18.344 --> 39:20.379
Sounds like it's
gonna be a long shift.

39:20.379 --> 39:21.172
Apparently.

39:22.206 --> 39:23.000
I gotta go.

39:24.034 --> 39:24.896
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:26.344 --> 39:27.482
Thanks for stopping by, Liz.

39:27.482 --> 39:29.482
It's always a pleasure.

39:43.965 --> 39:44.793
Hey.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.241
I'm about to put the
kids down for a nap.

39:48.241 --> 39:51.758
Miss Grace won't sleep until
you sing the alphabet remix.

39:51.758 --> 39:54.793
Ah, she will be coming
after your job soon.

40:00.241 --> 40:01.689
You seen anything interesting?

40:06.896 --> 40:07.724
Are you all right?

40:10.034 --> 40:11.724
Oh, Maya, are you okay?

40:14.827 --> 40:16.482
Here, let me, let me help you.

40:18.310 --> 40:21.344
Come on, I got you.

40:21.344 --> 40:22.137
Sorry.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.379
You okay?

40:26.379 --> 40:27.448
Yeah.

40:30.034 --> 40:33.689
Just haven't been feeling so
great these past couple days.

40:33.689 --> 40:35.482
Something like a stomach bug?

40:36.241 --> 40:37.000
Yeah.

40:39.862 --> 40:40.793
I guess so.

40:46.206 --> 40:48.000
Hey, Elle, don't
worry about it.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.827
I don't think Maya's gonna
be eating with us anyway.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.827
You know, she's
not feeling well.

40:52.827 --> 40:53.827
She'll probably be down
for the rest of the night.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.482
Plus the kids already ate, so...

40:55.482 --> 40:57.241
Well, I don't mind
cooking for you.

40:57.241 --> 40:59.793
And I could eat.

40:59.793 --> 41:02.275
Maybe we just have
dinner together,

41:02.275 --> 41:03.724
if that's okay with you.

41:05.517 --> 41:07.068
Sure.

41:07.068 --> 41:08.413
All right.

41:08.413 --> 41:09.655
Go relax.

41:09.655 --> 41:11.000
I'll take care of everything.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.517
I did, I used to play.

41:28.517 --> 41:29.724
I was really good.

41:29.724 --> 41:31.241
No.

41:31.241 --> 41:32.379
- Yes, I was.
- No, you weren't.

41:32.379 --> 41:33.827
Yeah, you should believe me.

41:33.827 --> 41:34.758
Don't I look like a
basketball player?

41:34.758 --> 41:36.034
Like, look at my arms.

41:36.034 --> 41:37.206
You don't.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.068
I work out.

41:39.068 --> 41:42.689
And I definitely, definitely
can shoot some hoops, so...

41:42.689 --> 41:44.448
Don't tell Maya about this.

41:44.448 --> 41:45.413
What?

41:45.413 --> 41:47.034
Of course not.

41:47.034 --> 41:47.862
Thank you.

41:49.241 --> 41:51.862
I haven't had the chance
to get to know you yet,

41:51.862 --> 41:54.206
so it's nice to have
a drink with you.

41:54.206 --> 41:56.068
It is nice.

41:56.068 --> 41:56.862
Cheers.

41:58.413 --> 42:00.448
And I deserve it, right?

42:00.448 --> 42:02.310
I do.

42:02.310 --> 42:05.310
I mean, it's not like Maya's
here to nag me about it anyway.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.586
Gosh, she worries too much.

42:08.689 --> 42:10.620
I can handle myself.

42:11.413 --> 42:12.241
She cares.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.655
That's, that's what that is.

42:14.655 --> 42:15.931
That's what that is?

42:15.931 --> 42:17.482
Yeah.

42:17.482 --> 42:18.068
I mean, you guys
have a good thing.

42:20.448 --> 42:21.586
You know what?

42:22.931 --> 42:25.379
I've been jealous
of women like Maya.

42:25.379 --> 42:26.103
Jealous, why?

42:27.310 --> 42:30.000
I just, come on.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.655
She has everything
that I've ever wanted.

42:32.655 --> 42:34.586
A good husband.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.827
This house is amazing.

42:36.827 --> 42:40.068
And your kids are so cute.

42:41.482 --> 42:42.931
They really are.

42:42.931 --> 42:44.275
I, I've always
wanted to be a mom.

42:45.275 --> 42:46.310
Really?

42:46.310 --> 42:47.103
Mm-hmm.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.586
I've always
wanted to be a dad.

42:50.586 --> 42:51.482
Really?

42:51.482 --> 42:53.344
Yeah.

42:53.344 --> 42:55.655
I mean, it'd be nice to
have one of my own one day.

42:57.137 --> 42:59.068
You know, I mean, gosh,

43:00.275 --> 43:02.103
that's all I've ever wanted.

43:02.103 --> 43:05.172
You know, my dad used
to always tell me,

43:05.172 --> 43:09.137
"A man's not a man unless
he knows how to raise one."

43:10.724 --> 43:12.379
Oh, well, that's an
interesting saying.

43:13.931 --> 43:15.758
He had a lot of them.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.827
All I've ever wanted to
do was to make him proud.

43:21.586 --> 43:25.862
Show him that I'm
my own man, right?

43:25.862 --> 43:27.827
Like, I hope I did that.

43:30.620 --> 43:32.931
Yeah, well, I can relate.

43:34.551 --> 43:37.000
I've had baby fever
since I was little.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.551
Really?

43:38.551 --> 43:39.896
Yes, I remember my
kindergarten teacher.

43:41.827 --> 43:44.724
She, she was pregnant

43:44.724 --> 43:48.241
and the next year she had
the cutest little baby.

43:48.241 --> 43:50.068
I was so obsessed with him.

43:50.068 --> 43:52.896
I kept wanting to carry him
around every time she visited.

43:53.896 --> 43:55.241
She was my favorite teacher.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.413
My kindergarten teacher
was a crazy bitch.

43:59.413 --> 44:00.827
Really?

44:00.827 --> 44:02.000
Yeah, my gosh.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.103
So sorry, that's awful.

44:05.551 --> 44:08.310
Ms. Johnson.

44:08.310 --> 44:09.724
Still remember her name.

44:09.724 --> 44:11.724
I will never forget her.

44:13.931 --> 44:15.620
Hey, where,

44:15.620 --> 44:17.448
where'd you say you
went to school at again?

44:17.448 --> 44:18.413
Seattle.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.310
Hooping in Seattle.

44:21.310 --> 44:22.586
Oh.

44:22.586 --> 44:23.103
Yeah, I didn't grow up here.

44:25.689 --> 44:30.310
Well, Miss Seattle,
who never played ball.

44:30.310 --> 44:31.068
Come on.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.724
I think you're going to
make a great mom one day.

44:38.241 --> 44:39.551
Cheers to that?

44:39.551 --> 44:41.551
Cheers to that.

44:43.586 --> 44:45.068
You didn't drink it.

44:45.068 --> 44:46.724
It's not real if
you don't drink it.

44:46.724 --> 44:48.206
I'm not worried about that.

44:52.413 --> 44:54.275
I'll...

44:54.275 --> 44:57.793
I'll check
on the girls when I head out.

44:58.793 --> 45:00.793
I gotta go to bed anyway, huh?

45:00.793 --> 45:04.793
Look, just maybe
not say anything.

45:04.793 --> 45:06.448
Keep this between us.

45:06.448 --> 45:08.000
Of course.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.310
Good night, Elle.

45:10.310 --> 45:11.275
Good night.

45:17.448 --> 45:18.448
Be careful.

45:18.448 --> 45:19.482
Them stairs.

45:19.482 --> 45:20.793
I know, I know.

45:42.965 --> 45:43.793
You.

45:44.620 --> 45:46.275
You're unbelievable.

45:48.068 --> 45:50.206
I've done so much for you

45:51.965 --> 45:55.172
and you can't do this
one thing for me.

45:58.172 --> 45:58.965
Just one.

45:59.896 --> 46:01.517
But you know what?

46:05.758 --> 46:10.379
I realize there's so
many women out there

46:10.379 --> 46:12.206
that would love to
gimme what I need.

46:13.517 --> 46:14.344
You know why?

46:15.517 --> 46:16.344
No?

46:18.758 --> 46:21.379
'Cause I'm a good man.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.586
A damn good man.

46:24.206 --> 46:26.000
Life would be so much
easier without you.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.586
Why?

46:29.586 --> 46:32.896
So you can use my insurance
money to pay off your debts?

46:41.241 --> 46:42.000
Huh.

46:44.137 --> 46:46.862
Now why didn't I think of that?

47:05.482 --> 47:07.448
No, no, no, no.

47:07.448 --> 47:08.586
Ian, Ian, stop.

47:10.206 --> 47:11.000
Ian, stop!

47:11.862 --> 47:13.344
Ian, I'm pregnant.

47:15.310 --> 47:16.241
I'm pregnant.

47:17.965 --> 47:19.137
I'm pregnant.

47:20.931 --> 47:21.931
What?

47:24.586 --> 47:27.655
Are you serious?

47:27.655 --> 47:29.620
I'm serious, I'm serious.

47:36.862 --> 47:39.482
Baby, that explains it then.

47:41.379 --> 47:43.000
That explains it.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.931
Why, why you've been so
hysterical, right, baby?

47:47.275 --> 47:49.551
Because of the hormones, right?

47:49.551 --> 47:53.965
Because, because
of the hormones, baby.

47:53.965 --> 47:58.172
Baby, baby, baby, we're
gonna have a child.

47:58.172 --> 47:59.000
Baby.

48:00.137 --> 48:02.896
Baby, we're gonna have a child.

48:02.896 --> 48:04.137
Oh my God, oh.

48:05.206 --> 48:07.034
Baby, you need your rest.

48:07.034 --> 48:09.000
You need your rest.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.758
You need to rest,
come on, right here.

48:12.758 --> 48:14.172
Lay down right here, lay down,

48:14.172 --> 48:15.689
lay, lay, lay down.

48:22.896 --> 48:23.689
Baby.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.379
You're pregnant, baby.

48:26.379 --> 48:28.172
You're pregnant.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.103
Baby, I'm gonna be a father.

48:30.103 --> 48:32.689
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

49:14.448 --> 49:16.310
Good to see you.

49:16.310 --> 49:17.103
Thank you.

49:19.482 --> 49:20.896
Hey.

49:20.896 --> 49:22.655
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

49:24.551 --> 49:25.896
Hey.

49:25.896 --> 49:28.482
Thanks, man, appreciate it.

49:28.482 --> 49:30.000
Good morning, Chief.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.655
Good morning.

49:31.655 --> 49:32.448
LT.

49:34.586 --> 49:36.724
You are gonna be Lieutenant
by the end of the day.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.448
The paperwork is almost done.

49:38.448 --> 49:39.965
Congratulations.

49:39.965 --> 49:41.448
So proud of you.

49:41.448 --> 49:42.310
Thank you, Chief,
it's an honor.

49:43.137 --> 49:44.827
Hey, listen.

49:44.827 --> 49:46.000
Me and the guys
wanna take you out

49:46.000 --> 49:47.137
at the end of the shift, right?

49:47.137 --> 49:48.310
So don't go anywhere, right?

49:48.310 --> 49:49.137
- Let's do it.
- All right.

49:49.137 --> 49:50.310
You know where.

49:50.310 --> 49:51.379
Excuse me.

49:52.620 --> 49:54.137
Emily Stocklan called again,

49:54.137 --> 49:56.586
looking for a wellness
check on her dad.

49:56.586 --> 49:58.241
I told you we don't have
the manpower for that.

49:58.241 --> 49:59.000
Wait, wait, wait.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.620
Who?

50:00.620 --> 50:02.241
A woman wants us to
check in on her father.

50:02.241 --> 50:04.068
Apparently he's not
answering the phone.

50:04.068 --> 50:06.068
She's called three
times this morning.

50:06.068 --> 50:07.206
What's the address?

50:11.448 --> 50:13.068
What?

50:13.068 --> 50:16.413
It's my neighbor,
older guy, confused.

50:16.413 --> 50:18.931
Chief, you mind if I pop
in and check in on him?

50:18.931 --> 50:20.068
I'll come with you.

50:20.068 --> 50:21.620
No, no, it's, it's fine.

50:21.620 --> 50:22.896
You should have
someone with you.

50:22.896 --> 50:23.724
I said I can handle it, Liz.

50:23.724 --> 50:25.586
Hey, hey, hey.

50:25.586 --> 50:26.758
Both of you go.

50:26.758 --> 50:27.551
Make it fast.

50:41.068 --> 50:42.137
Have you seen
him around lately?

50:42.137 --> 50:44.137
A couple days ago.

50:44.137 --> 50:46.206
He dropped off some mail
that he grabbed by accident.

50:51.724 --> 50:52.551
Mr. Stocklan!

50:53.724 --> 50:55.034
It's Ian Flynn, your neighbor!

50:57.000 --> 50:58.206
Let's go around back.

51:11.310 --> 51:12.793
Oh, wait a minute, wait.

51:12.793 --> 51:14.793
I think I see something.

51:41.620 --> 51:42.896
Hey, Chief.

51:42.896 --> 51:45.310
Yeah, suicide from
the looks of it.

51:45.310 --> 51:46.655
Yeah, coroner's taking
a look right now,

51:46.655 --> 51:49.551
but it looks like it's
gonna be pretty cut and dry.

51:49.551 --> 51:50.793
Yeah, yeah.

51:50.793 --> 51:51.827
Okay.

51:51.827 --> 51:53.896
Hernandez is talking to
the family right now.

51:53.896 --> 51:55.137
Okay.

51:55.137 --> 51:56.482
No, no, no, it's fine,
I'll, I'll wait around.

51:56.482 --> 51:58.724
You know, just in case
they need anything.

51:59.862 --> 52:01.275
All right, bye-bye.

52:04.068 --> 52:05.620
Talk to the daughter?

52:06.689 --> 52:08.206
Did you know him well?

52:09.103 --> 52:11.034
Ran into him in the streets
a couple times, you know?

52:11.034 --> 52:13.931
Lonely guy, but friendly.

52:13.931 --> 52:14.965
Seemed nice.

52:14.965 --> 52:15.862
It's a shame.

52:15.862 --> 52:17.172
Yeah.

52:18.827 --> 52:21.241
His daughter says it
came outta nowhere.

52:21.241 --> 52:22.448
Well, I mean,

52:22.448 --> 52:24.310
some people don't talk
about anything, you know?

52:24.310 --> 52:25.103
That's the way it is.

52:25.103 --> 52:26.206
Especially family.

52:26.206 --> 52:28.275
He had his keys on him.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.931
Your point?

52:29.931 --> 52:32.862
His house keys, in his pocket.

52:34.379 --> 52:36.103
Who carries their
keys around on them

52:36.103 --> 52:38.724
when they're planning
on killing themself?

52:38.724 --> 52:40.620
A lonely old man, Liz.

52:40.620 --> 52:43.344
Everybody's not as
sharp as you, Hernandez.

52:44.379 --> 52:46.689
Yeah, but something's off.

52:48.275 --> 52:50.206
Well, we'll wait for a
coroner's report, you know,

52:50.206 --> 52:52.620
get a cause of death.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.413
But, I mean, it
just is what it is.

52:55.413 --> 52:58.448
I mean, we have our people
looking at the scene, Liz.

52:59.482 --> 53:02.310
I mean, this guy, I mean, there
was no fingerprints, right?

53:02.310 --> 53:04.275
Nobody forced
themselves in the house.

53:04.275 --> 53:06.275
This guy had no enemies.

53:06.275 --> 53:08.344
Just a lonely old man

53:08.344 --> 53:10.827
who his only family lived
hours away from him.

53:12.517 --> 53:15.034
You know, sometimes the
answer's right in front of you.

53:15.034 --> 53:17.000
Don't think too hard.

53:18.827 --> 53:20.724
I'm gonna stick around.

53:20.724 --> 53:23.586
Why don't you head back to
the station, Lieutenant?

53:24.724 --> 53:26.931
Sure there's a party
brewing for you

53:26.931 --> 53:28.758
that you should get back to.

53:30.103 --> 53:31.931
Yeah, right.

54:12.344 --> 54:14.724
Are you ready for
the tickle monster?

54:19.379 --> 54:20.517
Oh, bedtime
already, huh?

54:20.517 --> 54:22.965
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

54:22.965 --> 54:27.655
Well, the only one I know
is about a Queen Noelle.

54:27.655 --> 54:29.034
Have you ever heard of that one?

54:30.103 --> 54:30.862
- No.
- No?

54:32.689 --> 54:36.034
Well, there once was a
beautiful queen named Noelle.

54:36.034 --> 54:39.172
She lived in a magical castle
with her sister, Grace,

54:39.172 --> 54:39.931
and their mom.

54:41.689 --> 54:44.827
And her big crown
and her big sword.

54:44.827 --> 54:46.689
Of course.

54:46.689 --> 54:50.241
So when there was a dragon that
came to attack the castle...

54:50.241 --> 54:51.724
She fought it.

54:51.724 --> 54:52.586
No.

54:54.241 --> 54:56.413
Queen Noelle was way
smarter than that.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.620
She knew there were
people inside that castle

54:59.620 --> 55:01.379
who could be hurt
by that dragon.

55:02.241 --> 55:03.896
So instead of fighting,

55:03.896 --> 55:06.068
she helped them escape
to another castle

55:06.068 --> 55:07.931
deep inside the woods

55:07.931 --> 55:10.793
where she knew they would
be safe from that dragon.

55:10.793 --> 55:13.310
Queen Noelle wouldn't
run away from a fight.

55:13.310 --> 55:14.379
Hmm.

55:15.793 --> 55:17.586
Well, sometimes running away is

55:19.172 --> 55:20.724
the smartest thing you can do.

57:47.379 --> 57:48.172
Noelle?

57:49.344 --> 57:50.862
Maya!

57:50.862 --> 57:51.724
Noelle?

57:51.724 --> 57:52.379
Grace?

57:52.379 --> 57:53.965
Maya!

57:53.965 --> 57:55.137
Oh my God.

57:55.137 --> 57:56.620
Ian, why are you yelling?

57:56.620 --> 57:58.034
Hey, baby, the,
the kids are missing.

57:58.034 --> 57:59.379
What do you mean
they're missing?

57:59.379 --> 58:00.896
They're not in their rooms.

58:00.896 --> 58:02.172
They're gone, I don't
know where they are.

58:02.172 --> 58:02.655
- Ian!
- Noelle!

58:04.137 --> 58:05.655
- Oh my God.
- Grace!

58:08.965 --> 58:11.103
I didn't hear
anything, I don't know.

58:12.965 --> 58:15.931
What time do you think
you went to bed last night?

58:15.931 --> 58:16.862
Maybe 10.

58:18.724 --> 58:20.758
The next thing I know, Ian
is yelling that they're gone.

58:25.275 --> 58:26.689
It's okay.

58:26.689 --> 58:28.000
We're gonna find them.

58:29.103 --> 58:30.655
Okay?

58:30.655 --> 58:32.896
Now, I don't know
if Ian told you,

58:32.896 --> 58:34.931
but I stopped by your
house the other day.

58:37.241 --> 58:38.793
Why?

58:38.793 --> 58:39.689
We got a call from
one of your neighbors

58:39.689 --> 58:40.931
about a disturbance.

58:42.206 --> 58:44.793
And I saw you guys have
some cameras set up.

58:44.793 --> 58:46.758
Please don't tell Ian.

58:46.758 --> 58:48.586
He has no idea
that I have those.

58:48.586 --> 58:49.793
And what do you mean?

58:51.827 --> 58:53.862
He wanted me to take them down

58:53.862 --> 58:55.862
'cause he thought they
looked creepy, but I didn't.

58:59.103 --> 59:01.344
That footage gets
downloaded to my computer,

59:01.344 --> 59:05.034
but I have no idea what, or if
anything useful is on there.

59:06.896 --> 59:08.655
Well, why did you put
them up in the first place?

59:10.586 --> 59:12.172
Because I was
going back to work

59:14.068 --> 59:17.896
and I wanted to keep an eye
on the nanny and the kids.

59:20.551 --> 59:21.931
I know, Chief.

59:26.206 --> 59:27.137
Right.

59:28.586 --> 59:29.344
Give me a second.

59:35.965 --> 59:37.827
We're gonna pull out
every resource we have.

59:37.827 --> 59:39.310
Chief, those are my kids.

59:39.310 --> 59:40.068
I know.

59:47.034 --> 59:50.000
I think they're finished
sweeping your house for prints,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.034
so you and Ian are
fine to go back.

59:54.034 --> 59:58.724
But when you do, I want you to
plug this into your computer.

1:00:03.551 --> 1:00:05.689
It'll give me remote access

1:00:05.689 --> 1:00:07.310
and let me look
through the footage.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.379
Thank you.

1:00:15.379 --> 1:00:20.241
You're welcome.

1:00:30.586 --> 1:00:32.448
Only you would sleep
through the kidnapping

1:00:32.448 --> 1:00:33.344
of your own children.

1:00:37.379 --> 1:00:38.758
I can't do this.

1:00:40.344 --> 1:00:41.172
I need some air.

1:00:43.068 --> 1:00:44.689
Flynn!

1:00:44.689 --> 1:00:45.931
There's something
you need to see.

1:00:49.068 --> 1:00:52.068
Well, we're currently waiting
on fingerprint analysis.

1:00:52.068 --> 1:00:54.172
Locks on the back
door were broken

1:00:54.172 --> 1:00:56.068
and it looked like
nothing was stolen.

1:01:06.379 --> 1:01:07.379
Elle.

1:01:10.103 --> 1:01:11.344
Ian.

1:01:11.344 --> 1:01:12.827
What the hell is happening?

1:01:12.827 --> 1:01:13.931
Maya texted me to
come to the station.

1:01:15.310 --> 1:01:16.344
Kids are gone.

1:01:16.344 --> 1:01:17.482
What do you mean gone?

1:01:17.482 --> 1:01:18.620
I just saw them last night.

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:19.551
Where's Maya?

1:01:19.551 --> 1:01:21.103
I don't know.

1:01:21.103 --> 1:01:22.827
She went to get some
air or something.

1:01:22.827 --> 1:01:24.413
Let me go see
if I can find her,

1:01:24.413 --> 1:01:26.655
but just call me if you
need something, okay?

1:01:26.655 --> 1:01:28.655
Hey, can we chat real quick?

1:01:28.655 --> 1:01:30.034
I'd love to get a statement.

1:01:31.448 --> 1:01:32.241
Of course.

1:01:48.655 --> 1:01:50.034
Everything good over there?

1:01:51.517 --> 1:01:52.965
Yeah, yeah, I'll be back soon.

1:01:54.517 --> 1:01:55.793
Oh, it's fine, I'm
using a burner.

1:02:01.448 --> 1:02:02.620
Ian.

1:02:02.620 --> 1:02:02.896
Something's wrong.

1:02:04.275 --> 1:02:04.896
What?

1:02:13.034 --> 1:02:16.172
So I dug a little deeper.

1:02:16.172 --> 1:02:18.655
There's no one named Elle Taylor

1:02:18.655 --> 1:02:20.827
that's even registered
in this state.

1:02:21.793 --> 1:02:23.344
She doesn't exist.

1:02:26.827 --> 1:02:27.827
Who is she?

1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:36.448
Okay.

1:02:45.172 --> 1:02:47.793
We have facial recognition
software running.

1:02:47.793 --> 1:02:48.793
We'll find her.

1:02:50.137 --> 1:02:51.172
Hernandez, we
need you out here.

1:03:10.379 --> 1:03:13.689
Sorry, Chief, I
gotta find my wife.

1:03:44.379 --> 1:03:45.793
Maya!

1:03:53.241 --> 1:03:54.413
Rachelle Turner.

1:04:19.931 --> 1:04:20.862
What's going on over here?

1:04:20.862 --> 1:04:22.034
Is everything all right?

1:04:22.034 --> 1:04:23.620
Everything's fine, sir.

1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:24.413
Can I help you?

1:04:28.655 --> 1:04:29.482
Ian?

1:04:31.586 --> 1:04:33.103
Mr. Stocklan.

1:04:33.103 --> 1:04:35.034
Heard a commotion
coming from your house.

1:04:35.034 --> 1:04:37.758
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:04:37.758 --> 1:04:39.275
Are you feeling all right?

1:04:39.275 --> 1:04:41.206
I'd like to speak
with your wife.

1:04:41.206 --> 1:04:42.655
She's out back
taking out the garbage.

1:04:42.655 --> 1:04:44.620
We had a little accident.

1:04:44.620 --> 1:04:46.103
But I'm sure she'll tell you

1:04:46.103 --> 1:04:48.068
that this was all just
a misunderstanding.

1:04:49.689 --> 1:04:50.689
Here, let me show you.

1:04:50.689 --> 1:04:51.517
Take you out back.

1:04:58.758 --> 1:05:00.827
I guess she'll be back.

1:05:00.827 --> 1:05:01.655
Where is she?

1:05:03.172 --> 1:05:04.862
She went to the store.

1:05:04.862 --> 1:05:06.241
It's funny, she
was just out here.

1:05:06.241 --> 1:05:07.827
I heard her scream.

1:05:07.827 --> 1:05:09.206
I saw you hit her!

1:05:10.241 --> 1:05:11.206
I've already called the police.

1:05:11.206 --> 1:05:12.689
They're on their way.

1:05:42.206 --> 1:05:43.000
Chief!

1:05:45.206 --> 1:05:46.724
Chief!

1:05:46.724 --> 1:05:48.206
So this whole time,

1:05:48.206 --> 1:05:49.827
you've been some sort
of actress, right?

1:05:49.827 --> 1:05:51.275
It's not what you think.

1:05:51.275 --> 1:05:53.344
Well, correct me if I'm wrong.

1:05:53.344 --> 1:05:55.448
I think Rachelle went
to our high school.

1:05:55.448 --> 1:05:56.827
I think you know
that she never worked

1:05:56.827 --> 1:05:58.000
for a nannying company.

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.586
You hired her, independently.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:03.000
I think you knew that she
was using a fake name.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000
Hell, I think you knew
that this whole time,

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.172
she was the one trying
to kidnap our kids.

1:06:07.172 --> 1:06:09.241
They're not your kids.

1:06:12.137 --> 1:06:13.413
No you don't.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:32.896
I got you, Rachelle.

1:07:32.896 --> 1:07:34.137
What's her name?

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:35.379
What's my girl's
name right here?

1:07:36.827 --> 1:07:39.000
Hmm, oh, wow.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.172
Good job.

1:07:40.172 --> 1:07:42.241
That's nice.

1:07:42.241 --> 1:07:45.620
Okay, so now we should, we
should see if the giraffe...

1:07:48.827 --> 1:07:49.724
Girls, girls, shh.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.965
Let's play quietly, okay?

1:07:52.965 --> 1:07:55.965
Stay right here
and play quietly.

1:07:55.965 --> 1:07:56.793
I'll be right back.

1:08:29.862 --> 1:08:32.033
Thank God you're all right.

1:08:32.033 --> 1:08:33.517
I was so worried he'd hurt you.

1:08:34.792 --> 1:08:38.103
Thank you for
everything, Rachelle.

1:08:38.103 --> 1:08:39.550
They're safe.

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:40.413
We did it.

1:08:40.413 --> 1:08:41.517
We got away with it.

1:08:42.862 --> 1:08:43.792
We're not safe yet.

1:08:45.758 --> 1:08:46.862
He knows about you.

1:08:49.689 --> 1:08:51.517
Noelle, Grace.

1:08:53.758 --> 1:08:55.517
Babies, are you there?

1:08:55.517 --> 1:08:57.033
Oh!

1:08:57.033 --> 1:08:58.379
Oh, look at you.

1:08:59.931 --> 1:09:02.827
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

1:09:02.827 --> 1:09:04.309
Are you guys okay?

1:09:10.137 --> 1:09:12.033
Thank you for
everything, Rachelle.

1:09:12.033 --> 1:09:14.931
You girls always had my
back, ever since high school.

1:09:16.517 --> 1:09:18.448
Sis,
you know I got you.

1:09:20.172 --> 1:09:21.792
Sorry I've been
away for so long.

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:26.344
I still can't forgive myself
for missing the funeral.

1:09:26.344 --> 1:09:28.344
No, what matters is
that you're here now.

1:09:28.344 --> 1:09:30.448
If you weren't traveling
and working so much,

1:09:30.448 --> 1:09:33.033
you wouldn't have
this beautiful ranch.

1:09:33.033 --> 1:09:33.827
Yeah.

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.241
And we should be safe here.

1:09:38.482 --> 1:09:40.448
If you would've told
me what was going on,

1:09:40.448 --> 1:09:43.103
I would've left
sooner, seriously.

1:09:43.103 --> 1:09:44.585
Rachelle, no one knew.

1:09:45.792 --> 1:09:47.309
And I was stupid enough

1:09:47.309 --> 1:09:48.931
to think that I could
handle it by myself.

1:09:51.931 --> 1:09:53.033
He was keeping me disoriented,

1:09:53.033 --> 1:09:54.172
away from my family and friends.

1:09:54.172 --> 1:09:55.448
I was done.

1:09:57.309 --> 1:09:59.448
And trust that he would've
tried to pull us apart.

1:10:00.482 --> 1:10:01.275
Never.

1:10:02.862 --> 1:10:04.517
We go too far back for that.

1:10:06.103 --> 1:10:07.620
Everything's gonna be fine now.

1:10:10.482 --> 1:10:13.448
I think me going to the
police station worked,

1:10:13.448 --> 1:10:15.275
made me seem less
suspicious to Ian.

1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:18.206
Yeah, well, I think
it was a good idea

1:10:18.206 --> 1:10:19.309
that I brought that
stupid sandwich

1:10:19.309 --> 1:10:20.517
and pretended it was his lunch!

1:10:21.379 --> 1:10:22.827
You know what?

1:10:22.827 --> 1:10:23.758
That's my girl.

1:10:26.275 --> 1:10:28.585
Sometimes you gotta
laugh instead of crying.

1:10:30.862 --> 1:10:32.241
Rachelle, I'm scared of him.

1:10:33.862 --> 1:10:35.413
That man is dangerous.

1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:39.448
And it's only a matter of time

1:10:39.448 --> 1:10:41.585
before he figures
everything out and finds us.

1:10:43.482 --> 1:10:45.344
That man is never gonna stop
looking for me, Rachelle.

1:10:49.103 --> 1:10:50.413
And I guess his plan worked.

1:10:54.172 --> 1:10:55.344
I'm pregnant.

1:10:58.896 --> 1:11:02.448
So now what's gonna
happen to me and my girls?

1:11:02.448 --> 1:11:04.517
Nothing's gonna happen.

1:11:04.517 --> 1:11:05.862
Our plan won't change.

1:11:07.689 --> 1:11:11.275
I should have left
that man a long time ago,

1:11:11.275 --> 1:11:13.344
but I was afraid that
he would hurt himself

1:11:14.448 --> 1:11:16.379
like his dad did.

1:11:16.379 --> 1:11:18.448
Wait, you never
told me about his dad.

1:11:18.448 --> 1:11:19.655
He was a cop too.

1:11:21.517 --> 1:11:24.862
Struggled with depression
and took his own life,

1:11:24.862 --> 1:11:26.000
right before I met Ian.

1:11:27.758 --> 1:11:29.550
God, I put myself,

1:11:31.931 --> 1:11:35.413
I put my girls in danger
because I pitied him.

1:11:37.689 --> 1:11:39.103
I thought that I could save him

1:11:39.103 --> 1:11:41.655
and in the meantime lost myself.

1:11:43.585 --> 1:11:48.000
Girl, some things we have to
turn over to God and therapy.

1:11:49.585 --> 1:11:51.206
You were never meant
to save that man.

1:11:51.206 --> 1:11:52.413
Yes, but by the
time I realized that,

1:11:52.413 --> 1:11:54.241
he threatened to set me up.

1:11:54.241 --> 1:11:56.517
Just stop it, okay?

1:11:56.517 --> 1:11:58.517
That's why we're here.

1:11:58.517 --> 1:12:00.448
That's why you devised a
plan that's going to work.

1:12:00.448 --> 1:12:01.931
We just have to follow it.

1:12:03.585 --> 1:12:06.585
My friend will have new
IDs for you by morning.

1:12:06.585 --> 1:12:08.585
I'll disappear with the girls

1:12:08.585 --> 1:12:10.344
and you go to the police and
tell them everything you have.

1:12:10.344 --> 1:12:13.103
I just told you, he's
the new lieutenant.

1:12:13.103 --> 1:12:15.034
Everybody over there loves him.

1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:17.965
Now, Rachelle, I'm
trying to tell you

1:12:17.965 --> 1:12:19.655
that I don't know about
this plan anymore.

1:12:19.655 --> 1:12:22.793
No, we're sure about the plan.

1:12:22.793 --> 1:12:24.724
Didn't you say you
trust that lady cop?

1:12:26.344 --> 1:12:27.931
I don't know if I
trust anyone anymore.

1:12:29.620 --> 1:12:32.068
Someone's at the gate.

1:12:32.068 --> 1:12:33.137
Here it is.

1:12:33.137 --> 1:12:33.931
Here.

1:12:37.344 --> 1:12:38.103
We have to go.

1:12:39.137 --> 1:12:39.931
My God.

1:12:46.517 --> 1:12:47.620
My God, we gotta get outta here.

1:12:47.620 --> 1:12:49.309
Okay, go grab the bags.

1:12:49.309 --> 1:12:50.655
There's only one
road in and out.

1:12:50.655 --> 1:12:52.758
They're already on their way.

1:12:52.758 --> 1:12:54.585
Noelle, come on, let's go
to my secret hiding place.

1:12:54.585 --> 1:12:56.103
Let's go, let me show you.

1:12:56.103 --> 1:12:56.965
Here's Mama.

1:12:56.965 --> 1:12:58.000
Hey, baby.

1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.172
Okay, this is yours.

1:12:59.172 --> 1:13:00.758
I wanna stay here with you.

1:13:00.758 --> 1:13:02.379
No, no, no, no, no,
baby, listen, listen.

1:13:02.379 --> 1:13:03.482
We're just playing
hide and seek, okay?

1:13:03.482 --> 1:13:05.241
I need you to hide for Mommy.

1:13:05.241 --> 1:13:07.550
Just promise me you'll take
care of your sister, okay?

1:13:08.655 --> 1:13:10.379
Okay, I love you so much.

1:13:10.379 --> 1:13:12.550
Okay, you guys get
outta here, okay?

1:13:12.550 --> 1:13:14.448
It'll be just fine,
baby, I promise.

1:13:15.241 --> 1:13:16.137
Got it, baby?

1:13:16.137 --> 1:13:17.379
Come on, okay.

1:13:17.379 --> 1:13:18.448
Got it?

1:13:18.448 --> 1:13:19.103
Alright, let's go.

1:13:29.793 --> 1:13:31.413
Come on.

1:13:31.413 --> 1:13:35.241
Let's go, let's keep
going, go to the right.

1:13:35.241 --> 1:13:36.034
Okay.

1:13:41.965 --> 1:13:43.000
Okay.

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.344
Stay right here, okay?

1:13:44.344 --> 1:13:45.655
Until I come and get you.

1:13:47.068 --> 1:13:47.862
Okay.

1:13:50.827 --> 1:13:51.655
Sorry.

1:14:00.206 --> 1:14:01.034
Okay.

1:14:06.724 --> 1:14:07.517
Okay.

1:14:18.379 --> 1:14:20.379
Forgive me for
bringing you into this.

1:14:20.379 --> 1:14:22.448
That's what sisters are for.

1:14:22.448 --> 1:14:23.517
Okay?

1:14:24.275 --> 1:14:25.034
Maya!

1:14:27.862 --> 1:14:30.931
Baby, I know you're in there.

1:14:30.931 --> 1:14:31.758
Elle!

1:14:33.206 --> 1:14:36.103
Or should I call you Rachelle?

1:14:36.103 --> 1:14:37.655
Come out, both of you,

1:14:37.655 --> 1:14:38.965
or I will come in
and drag you out.

1:14:40.793 --> 1:14:42.172
We're making it outta
this together, you hear me?

1:14:43.758 --> 1:14:45.172
Come on, baby, I'm
giving you a choice!

1:14:46.620 --> 1:14:48.448
That's how you wanna play?

1:14:48.448 --> 1:14:51.068
You can never make things easy
for me, can you, sweetheart?

1:15:03.379 --> 1:15:04.793
Come on, come on.

1:15:25.793 --> 1:15:27.448
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:15:27.448 --> 1:15:28.172
I'll protect you.

1:15:29.689 --> 1:15:31.309
I'll shoot if either
one of you move.

1:15:31.309 --> 1:15:33.793
Do it, coward.

1:15:33.793 --> 1:15:35.482
Where are the girls?

1:15:35.482 --> 1:15:37.620
You will never
see my babies again.

1:15:39.413 --> 1:15:40.793
Don't you dare.

1:15:42.655 --> 1:15:46.241
If you shoot her, I will
kill myself and your baby.

1:15:50.448 --> 1:15:51.758
Baby, you ain't got it in you.

1:15:51.758 --> 1:15:52.931
I don't believe you.

1:15:52.931 --> 1:15:53.793
Try me.

1:15:59.655 --> 1:16:01.517
No one's here.

1:16:01.517 --> 1:16:02.655
The place is torn up.

1:16:04.103 --> 1:16:05.896
What could he have
done with her?

1:16:07.275 --> 1:16:09.896
If you just let Elle
go, I will go with you.

1:16:11.793 --> 1:16:15.689
I won't hurt myself or our
baby if you just let her go.

1:16:17.103 --> 1:16:18.344
No, no.

1:16:18.344 --> 1:16:20.137
She'll tell everybody.

1:16:20.137 --> 1:16:21.275
Oh, no, no, no, baby, we're
in the middle of nowhere.

1:16:21.275 --> 1:16:22.862
She won't have time.

1:16:22.862 --> 1:16:25.344
Honey, we will be long gone.

1:16:25.344 --> 1:16:26.448
All right?

1:16:26.448 --> 1:16:27.172
You, me, and our family.

1:16:30.034 --> 1:16:31.655
'Cause we're family, right?

1:16:31.655 --> 1:16:32.724
Yes, baby.

1:16:32.724 --> 1:16:33.896
That's right.

1:16:33.896 --> 1:16:35.517
Better than my old man, right?

1:16:35.517 --> 1:16:36.517
And I never abandoned you.

1:16:36.517 --> 1:16:38.172
I never abandoned you.

1:16:38.172 --> 1:16:39.172
No, no, no, no, no.

1:16:39.172 --> 1:16:40.689
You tried to leave me.

1:16:40.689 --> 1:16:41.862
Because pregnancy
makes you confused.

1:16:42.862 --> 1:16:44.172
Okay?

1:16:44.172 --> 1:16:45.689
It's okay.

1:16:45.689 --> 1:16:47.517
I promise you, we
can just leave.

1:16:47.517 --> 1:16:49.275
We can get out of town,

1:16:49.275 --> 1:16:52.413
and I promise you, promise you
that I will obey this time.

1:16:52.413 --> 1:16:54.103
Okay?

1:16:54.103 --> 1:16:59.068
All you have to do
is let Rachelle go.

1:16:59.758 --> 1:17:01.585
Ian, come on.

1:17:01.585 --> 1:17:03.309
You know how to
make us disappear.

1:17:03.309 --> 1:17:04.655
Yeah?

1:17:04.655 --> 1:17:06.309
Yeah.

1:17:06.309 --> 1:17:09.620
Listen, Ian, she'll
just slow us down.

1:17:09.620 --> 1:17:11.309
Just let her go.

1:17:11.309 --> 1:17:13.482
She serves no purpose,
honey, come on,

1:17:13.482 --> 1:17:16.068
it's just us and the family.

1:17:16.068 --> 1:17:18.379
Elle, get outta here
before I change my mind.

1:17:19.309 --> 1:17:20.137
Go!

1:17:21.448 --> 1:17:23.034
It's okay, it's okay, go, go!

1:17:33.931 --> 1:17:34.896
Hello?

1:17:34.896 --> 1:17:36.793
Can somebody hear me?

1:17:36.793 --> 1:17:37.827
Hello, hello?

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:39.655
Can somebody hear me?

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:41.206
We need help, hello.

1:18:00.620 --> 1:18:02.862
How do I know
you won't shoot me?

1:18:04.413 --> 1:18:06.550
Baby, I have my priorities
straight, all right?

1:18:06.550 --> 1:18:07.448
Okay.

1:18:07.448 --> 1:18:09.309
Okay.

1:18:09.309 --> 1:18:10.793
Just put the gun down so
I know you won't hurt me.

1:18:10.793 --> 1:18:12.585
All right.

1:18:12.585 --> 1:18:14.275
All right, it's
going away, okay?

1:18:15.241 --> 1:18:17.517
It's gone, okay?

1:18:17.517 --> 1:18:18.827
Baby, put the knife down.

1:18:20.309 --> 1:18:21.965
Come on, put it down.

1:18:23.275 --> 1:18:24.103
Okay.

1:18:31.344 --> 1:18:32.689
Okay, come here.

1:18:32.689 --> 1:18:34.103
Come here, baby.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.413
Okay, now where did you stash
the girls over here, right?

1:18:39.413 --> 1:18:43.620
Tell 'em that daddy's home to
come save the day, all right?

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:45.482
Okay?
Okay.

1:18:45.482 --> 1:18:48.137
You can just stay right
here and I'll go get them.

1:18:51.413 --> 1:18:53.793
How should I explain
all this to the girls?

1:18:55.137 --> 1:18:58.275
Just, just tell 'em
the truth, baby, okay?

1:19:00.172 --> 1:19:02.000
Tell 'em that Elle made Mommy
and Daddy fight, all right,

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.413
and now she's gone and
she'll never come back, okay?

1:19:04.413 --> 1:19:05.793
Okay, okay.

1:19:05.793 --> 1:19:07.827
Would you mind getting my car?

1:19:07.827 --> 1:19:10.034
Because yours is gonna
be too easy to track.

1:19:10.034 --> 1:19:10.793
What are you talking about?

1:19:10.793 --> 1:19:11.931
I'm not stupid.

1:19:11.931 --> 1:19:12.758
No, no, no, Ian, I
know that you're not-

1:19:29.413 --> 1:19:30.724
Oh, babies, babies.

1:19:30.724 --> 1:19:31.585
- Mommy!
- I love you so much.

1:19:31.585 --> 1:19:32.655
Come on.
What's going on?

1:19:32.655 --> 1:19:34.689
It's okay, baby, everything's
gonna be just fine.

1:19:34.689 --> 1:19:36.000
Come on now, hurry.

1:19:38.137 --> 1:19:40.793
We're fine, baby, we're fine!

1:19:40.793 --> 1:19:42.758
Okay, Noelle, don't
hurt yourself!

1:19:42.758 --> 1:19:44.862
Okay, Noelle, go
in the other side.

1:19:44.862 --> 1:19:45.758
Go in the other side.

1:19:45.758 --> 1:19:47.241
Okay, Grace, let's get in here.

1:19:54.517 --> 1:19:55.931
Okay.

1:19:55.931 --> 1:19:57.965
Come on, Elle, come on!

1:19:58.550 --> 1:20:00.241
It's okay, baby.

1:20:00.241 --> 1:20:00.931
It's okay.

1:20:00.931 --> 1:20:02.550
You guys okay?

1:20:02.550 --> 1:20:03.862
Yeah, we need
to go, we need to go!

1:20:03.862 --> 1:20:05.241
Ian, no!

1:20:05.241 --> 1:20:07.206
Ian, the girls are in the car!

1:20:07.206 --> 1:20:08.034
Stop it!

1:20:08.034 --> 1:20:09.448
Oh my God, what do I do?

1:20:09.448 --> 1:20:11.206
Elle, what do I do?

1:20:11.206 --> 1:20:14.517
I don't know, drive the car!

1:20:26.793 --> 1:20:29.103
Maya, Rachelle,
are you all right?

1:20:29.103 --> 1:20:29.896
Yeah.

1:20:31.517 --> 1:20:32.620
Ian, he...

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:33.448
Where is he?

1:20:36.309 --> 1:20:40.068
Right there.

1:20:40.068 --> 1:20:44.482
Lieutenant Flynn, you have
the right to remain silent.

1:20:44.482 --> 1:20:46.241
Anything you say...

1:21:24.862 --> 1:21:26.482
Right.

1:21:26.482 --> 1:21:28.206
♪ Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ♪

1:21:28.206 --> 1:21:30.034

1:21:30.034 --> 1:21:31.862
Good job today!

1:21:31.862 --> 1:21:33.379
Oh my gosh.

1:21:33.379 --> 1:21:35.862
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

1:21:35.862 --> 1:21:37.758
Whew, good job!

1:21:37.758 --> 1:21:40.034
They love you so much.

1:21:40.034 --> 1:21:42.137
They're gonna be so upset
when you leave again.

1:21:42.137 --> 1:21:43.344
I won't be gone long.

1:21:44.862 --> 1:21:46.482
Thanks for covering
my class for me.

1:21:46.482 --> 1:21:48.034
Of course.

1:21:48.034 --> 1:21:49.068
It's my pleasure.

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:54.758
That used to be the song.

1:21:54.758 --> 1:21:55.931
So good to see you ladies.

1:21:55.931 --> 1:21:57.482
You too, you too.

1:21:57.482 --> 1:21:58.965
Wow, so catch us up.

1:21:58.965 --> 1:22:00.137
What's been going on?

1:22:00.137 --> 1:22:01.931
Tell us about the station.

1:22:01.931 --> 1:22:04.517
Well, it's a lot more work,

1:22:04.517 --> 1:22:07.655
but being promoted to
Chief is a huge honor.

1:22:10.344 --> 1:22:12.448
Are you guys gonna
drink that in front of me?

1:22:12.448 --> 1:22:14.896
Ah, come on, we can
give you a little whiff.

1:22:14.896 --> 1:22:16.000
Oh, thank you.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.517
Yeah, yeah, great.

1:22:17.517 --> 1:22:19.413
Oh, did you see
today's headline?

1:22:21.931 --> 1:22:23.827
Oh my God, everything
happened so fast.

1:22:23.827 --> 1:22:25.448
It doesn't seem real.

1:22:25.448 --> 1:22:27.413
Please, after all
that's happened,

1:22:27.413 --> 1:22:29.827
he was a strain
on the department.

1:22:29.827 --> 1:22:31.413
They were happy to wrap that up.

1:22:32.931 --> 1:22:34.034
And I don't know
if I ever told you,

1:22:34.034 --> 1:22:36.206
but in the middle of all this,

1:22:36.206 --> 1:22:38.862
I thought it was you that
was behind everything.

1:22:38.862 --> 1:22:42.000
I could have swore I was gonna
see your face on the news.

1:22:43.689 --> 1:22:45.275
Yeah, well, if you think
she's scandalous now,

1:22:45.275 --> 1:22:46.862
you should have seen
her in high school.

1:22:46.862 --> 1:22:49.103
And I plead the fifth.

1:22:49.103 --> 1:22:51.827
You better
plead the fifth.

1:22:51.827 --> 1:22:53.655
So how far along are you?

1:22:53.655 --> 1:22:56.241
Ah, second trimester.

1:22:56.241 --> 1:22:59.068
You think the third time
around would be easier, but no.

1:23:00.517 --> 1:23:03.103
That's why I'm happy
I got my girl back.

1:23:03.103 --> 1:23:04.655
She's gonna help me
out with the other two

1:23:04.655 --> 1:23:06.931
while I go back to teaching.

1:23:06.931 --> 1:23:07.724
Yay!

1:23:09.413 --> 1:23:11.034
You know what you're having?

1:23:12.413 --> 1:23:14.550
A boy.

1:23:16.931 --> 1:23:18.379
Well, ain't that something?

1:23:19.379 --> 1:23:20.793
It is.

1:23:20.793 --> 1:23:22.275
So when is the baby shower?

1:23:22.275 --> 1:23:23.585
'Cause that's what
I'm talking about.

1:23:23.585 --> 1:23:26.000
How about a destination
baby shower?

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.241
I'm talking Cabo.

1:23:27.241 --> 1:23:29.758
Look, we could go to Jamaica!

1:23:31.413 --> 1:23:34.758
