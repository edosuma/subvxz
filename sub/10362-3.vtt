I don't want to relocate in the US.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.160
It ain't safe around here no more.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.960
You give us Aldo Delucci and we'll send
you to the goddamn North Pole.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.440
[in Norwegian] I am the police chief,
and I insist that we go in.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.720
[in English]
Wouldn't you need a warrant for that?

00:37.800 --> 00:40.360
[Geir in Norwegian]  There's something
fishy about that guy.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.360
Says he's American,
but looks more like an Arab.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.600
What's with you?

00:45.680 --> 00:47.600
If you will permit your lawyer
to make a comment,

01:50.480 --> 01:51.800
Yeah?

01:51.880 --> 01:53.720
[in English]
Time to close out your tab.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.480
[in Norwegian] Oh, yeah, you guys are
from the place down in the village?

01:57.560 --> 02:01.000
[in English] Yeah, yeah. The problem is
my colleague here let you charge

02:01.080 --> 02:03.800
a hundred grand on champagne,
and your card bounced.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.320
Yeah, it bounced.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.840
Well, uh, I'm sure it's just, uh...

02:09.920 --> 02:13.280
a misunderstanding with the card company.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.800
We checked.
No misunderstanding.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.000
[in Norwegian]
This is just peanuts.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.040
[in English]
It's pennies. Okay?

02:25.160 --> 02:27.600
- I like pennies.
- Hey, hey!

02:30.600 --> 02:34.840
I'm not going to let two hillbillies
like you treat me like this, okay?

02:34.920 --> 02:38.320
[screaming in Norwegian]
Help! Help!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.520

- It's only pennies! Hey!

02:57.680 --> 03:01.360
How long, boss?
What is customary?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.160
That should do it.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.880
- Any new thoughts on my pennies?
- Okay, I'll pay. I'll pay.

Oh, you see? Nothing clears the mind
like an early morning swim.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.760

Let's see, my new MacBook,

Twenty thousand, easy...

03:33.880 --> 03:35.760

What's the story with this
Snowshoes Belleview here?

04:05.720 --> 04:09.880
[in Norwegian] A mountain apartment resort
that I'm involved in.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.920
[in English] It's, you know,
luxury apartments.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.360
[Torgeir] Nice.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.840
Hmm...

04:17.920 --> 04:22.960
I'll tell you what, give me one
of these condos and we'll call it even.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.120
[chuckles]

04:25.200 --> 04:27.760
[in Norwegian] But the cheapest units
start at three million.

04:27.840 --> 04:34.040
It says right here, five percent down,
which just about covers your bill.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.840
- Yeah.
- Take care of the rest later.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.320
[in Norwegian] Well, we need
a guarantee for the whole amount.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.240
[in English]
You know, a bank guarantee?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.920
You don't trust me?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.200
[in Norwegian]
It's not that, but...

04:45.360 --> 04:48.080
[in English] Yeah, good.
Then we have a deal.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.400
Or are you ready for another fucking swim?

04:51.480 --> 04:54.720
No.   I'll see what I can do.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
Yeah, you do that.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.680
Look at this.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.560
Yeah, it's radical.
It's a great condo.

and that one from sour milk.

-  This one is potato?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.760
Mmm!

05:29.840 --> 05:32.320
I'm serving
at the Birkebeiner race this year.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.400
Huh? Then who will be in charge
of security?

05:35.480 --> 05:39.000
That will have to be you. [chuckles]

05:39.080 --> 05:40.800
And the rest of the gang.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.640
We have a possible
Guantanamo ex-con in town,

05:43.720 --> 05:46.040
and your priority is waffles.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.560
I've put pressure on the PST
to give me more info on Henriksen,

05:49.640 --> 05:51.280
so we can't really do much more.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.560
Have you read this book?

05:53.640 --> 05:55.480
Global Terrorism.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.120
[in English] And what characterizes
terrorist targets?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.480
- [in Norwegian] No.
- Well, it's gatherings.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.120
[in English] Large gatherings.
Emotional impact. Media coverage.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.640
[in Norwegian] This is the Birkebeiner
race. We've got to be fully staffed.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.440

The sun is shining and soon the public
will be partying. Lighten up.

06:12.840 --> 06:18.720
Well, the sun was shining in New York
on September 10, 2001.

My name is Julius Backe, I'm the project
manager for Sjusjøen Belleview.

06:36.760 --> 06:43.760
Ever since I worked as a ski instructor
in the Alps... [laughs]

06:43.840 --> 06:47.560
I've been fascinated by
the mid-Europeans' ability

06:47.640 --> 06:52.000
to combine beautiful nature
with design and shopping.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.280
It's been my dream that we in Lillehammer
should achieve the same goal.

That almost gave me goose bumps.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.600
Are there any questions?

07:29.680 --> 07:36.640
Hi there. Tord, landowner, farmer,
and eco-philosopher at the Nansen School.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.160
According to these plans
for the water and sewage pipes,

07:40.240 --> 07:45.080
almost the whole route will go over
my property. I haven't approved of that.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.000
How did you get those?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.600
I guess some in the administration
aren't as excited as you are.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.120
All property owners will get
a generous compensation.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.280
I am not interested in your money
or your shit.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.320

I hope everyone will

08:01.400 --> 08:06.680

Okay.

Suppose I can talk some sense
into that half-a-Michael Moore,

09:13.400 --> 09:16.920
would you be willing
to sweeten the deal on my condo?

09:19.760 --> 09:24.000
[in Norwegian] I'll tell you one thing,
John. If you solve this thing,

09:24.080 --> 09:27.480
I'll make sure you get
a west-facing penthouse

09:27.560 --> 09:31.480

In Norway,

[in English] I've got some stuff
I got to do up in "Shoeshine."

17:14.920 --> 17:16.600
[in English] Stuff?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.600
[in Norwegian]
In the middle of our lesson?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.880
[in English] Yeah. We're just driving
around anyway, so what the fuck?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.040
Go ahead.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.560
[horn honks]

17:40.640 --> 17:45.360
[in Norwegian]
There you go. Enjoy.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.880
[clucking]

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Welcome to the farm.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.040
[in English] John Henriksen.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.560
Yeah?

17:54.640 --> 18:00.400
I've got a little business to discuss
if you got a minute.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.400
Business?

18:02.560 --> 18:08.360
Yeah, I'm here on behalf of some friends,
and we want to buy the place.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.560
It's a generous offer.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.520
It's not for sale.

18:13.240 --> 18:18.320
Look, uh, friend,
this project's going to happen.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.480
It's gonna happen the easy way,
or it's going to happen the hard way.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.400
[mockingly] Ooh...

18:25.480 --> 18:27.360
[in Norwegian]
Is this a threat?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
[in English]
Is this a threat?

18:29.520 --> 18:31.880
Just a little friendly advice.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.320
I'm not interested.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.080
[in Norwegian]
To use the words of Gandhi,

18:35.160 --> 18:37.200
[in English] "You have to be the change
you want to see in the world."

18:37.280 --> 18:41.280
Yeah, well, uh,
remember what Confucius said,

18:41.360 --> 18:47.200
"Man who pass on generous offer, often
wind up with an umbrella up his ass."

19:01.880 --> 19:04.240
Arve Østli - Commissioner
Gudbrandsdalen precinct

19:04.320 --> 19:07.640
[man in Norwegian]  As you've never seen
Therese Johaug before.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.600
The tough skier is on a mission--

19:12.760 --> 19:16.040
Got five minutes?

19:16.120 --> 19:16.960
POLICE

19:17.040 --> 19:20.560
- I'm on my way to an important meeting--
- I'll be quick.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.000
I'm the one working under Hovland.

19:23.080 --> 19:27.240
Yes, Elvis from the Christmas party.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.720
Yes.

19:31.440 --> 19:36.440
Well, it's not really my style
to go behind the back of my superior...

19:36.520 --> 19:39.000
It's just, Hovland doesn't seem to take

19:39.080 --> 19:41.800
the security at the Birkebeiner race
seriously enough.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.160
Listen, Tvedt.

19:44.240 --> 19:50.160
It's important to understand your role.
Aren't we going for standard procedure?

19:50.240 --> 19:56.760
Yeah, but this year we suspect there's a
relocated ex-con from Guantanamo in town.

19:56.880 --> 20:02.720
What? I haven't heard anything about it.
Is this intelligence from the PST?

20:02.800 --> 20:06.120
PST's holding their cards close
on this one, but my gut feeling--

20:06.200 --> 20:08.200
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

20:08.280 --> 20:12.320
It's not the role of a local
police chief's assistant to challenge

20:12.400 --> 20:16.600
the risk evaluations
of national security agencies.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.000
[knock on door]

20:18.120 --> 20:20.480
Arve, the national team
has already started the ski waxing class,

20:20.560 --> 20:22.720
so you'll have to hurry.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.520
Ah.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.760
Ski waxing class?

20:28.720 --> 20:33.080
Yes, I'm participating in the Birkebeiner
with the minister of justice this year,

20:33.160 --> 20:36.560
so I consider part of my job
to give a good performance.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.880
[whistles]

20:40.200 --> 20:44.120
[Torgeir breathing deeply]

20:44.200 --> 20:46.640
[in English] Fucking hell.
Fucking...

20:46.720 --> 20:50.040
Okay now, uh, let's not go
all Blackwater here.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.680
- We're just sending him a message.
- I got it. I got it, boss. I got it.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.520
Just mess the place up a little bit
so the treehugger knows

20:58.600 --> 21:01.160
we're not the kind of people
you fuck with.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.360
Yeah, I read you loud and clear, boss.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.480
Yeah.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.520
- Now, make me proud...
- Yeah.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.760
-...and go hit a home run.
- Yeah!

21:12.080 --> 21:14.320
Fuckin' prick.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.880
[grunts]

21:26.040 --> 21:28.160
[in Norwegian]
Did you fall asleep?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.720
Hey.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.840
Hmm.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.080
[metallic creaking outside]

21:47.680 --> 21:48.680
Huh.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.680
- [glass shattering]
- [screaming]

21:56.760 --> 22:00.640
[woman screaming]

22:02.280 --> 22:05.000
[muttering in English]
Yeah, I got that, I got that.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.600
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.040
[Torgeir] Shit!

22:11.480 --> 22:14.520
[in Norwegian]
Drive, drive, drive!

22:14.600 --> 22:16.640
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

22:27.280 --> 22:28.960
Zarathustra!

22:44.520 --> 22:46.400
[sighing]

22:58.280 --> 23:00.880
[cell phone rings]

23:05.440 --> 23:07.880
[in Norwegian]
Arve Østli here.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.880
This is Tord Haukenes.
I don't know whether you remember me,

23:10.960 --> 23:14.920
from that time Salman Rushdie visited
the Literature Festival?

23:15.000 --> 23:20.160
Yes, quite.
It's quite busy at the moment...

23:21.440 --> 23:23.200
But what is it about?

23:23.280 --> 23:25.480
Somebody killed our hen.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.760
A possible hen murder, you mean?

23:27.840 --> 23:29.520
Yes, the hen.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.160
I'm in a conflict
with some cabin capitalists

23:33.240 --> 23:37.520
and I think there's a link.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.640
[sighs] There's probably
a natural explanation.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.280
Natural explanation? A hen came through
our window and landed on the bed

23:44.360 --> 23:47.680
with its neck broken.
Do you consider that natural?

23:47.760 --> 23:52.120
As far as I remember,
you recently moved here from Oslo...

23:52.200 --> 23:55.160
What the hell does
that have to do with it?

23:55.240 --> 23:58.400
You're probably not used
to living in the woods.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.000
There are a lot of cases of birds
getting injured flying into windows.

24:02.080 --> 24:06.480
Honestly, this is
extremely unprofessional.

24:06.600 --> 24:12.920
Maybe you're used to having the police
available 24-7. We have scarce resources.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.080
[hangs up receiver]

24:19.200 --> 24:21.960
Siw. Siw?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.000
Wait up.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.320
[party horns tooting]

24:28.400 --> 24:30.960
[chattering]

24:38.840 --> 24:40.880
[in English] Hi.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.840
[in Norwegian] No, look...

24:44.960 --> 24:47.000
This is not a good time.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.800
[in English] We are having
a birthday party now.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.360
Have I, uh, mixed up
the dates or something?

24:52.440 --> 24:54.240
- Giovanni!
- [in English] My man!

24:54.320 --> 24:56.160
[in Norwegian]
Did you invite Giovanni?

24:56.240 --> 24:59.720
- You said I should invite my friends.
- Yeah.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.360
I can come back another time.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.560
Well, come in.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.800
[in English]
We have brownies.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.160
[in Norwegian]
It'll be nice.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.200
Wow. Look!

25:16.160 --> 25:18.360
Can I offer you some soda?

25:18.440 --> 25:20.080
[in English] Sounds great.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.320
[in Norwegian] The others are drinking
a mixture of Coke and Solo.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.760
[in English] What do you say, gang?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.880
Happy birthday, my friend.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.120
Thanks.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.080
[boy] Whoa!

25:40.280 --> 25:41.920
You like that?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.840
[laughs]

25:43.920 --> 25:47.600
Yeah, enjoy it, you know.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.120
Got a nice piece here.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.080
[bell dings]

26:04.720 --> 26:06.520
[in Norwegian] Hello. Welcome!

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
Remember to behave, Embrik.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.640
Come in.

26:10.720 --> 26:14.120
I'd appreciate it if you could be
a bit careful with candy.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.040
He's not used to it
and he can get a bit hyperactive.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.160
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of him.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.400
- Yeah. Good-bye.
- Okay.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.080
Look what Johnny gave me!

26:29.160 --> 26:33.360
But you didn't have to buy him
something that expensive.

26:33.440 --> 26:38.240
[in English] I just had it laying around.
Didn't know it was so important.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.280
[in Norwegian]
Hey. Happy birthday.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.000
Thank you.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.240
Exciting.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.160
Thanks?

26:52.240 --> 26:54.760
- What is it?
- A scratching stick.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.520
For scratching your back.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.960
See.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.760
[Sigrid] That's neat!

27:06.680 --> 27:10.120
Great gift, Embrik.

27:10.200 --> 27:14.400
At my house, we don't approve
of materialistic gifts.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.880
[in English] Excuse me?

27:15.960 --> 27:18.680
[in Norwegian]
It's good that we're all different.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.000
[in English]
Do you speak English?

27:21.080 --> 27:23.920
Yes. English, German and Esperanto.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.720
Ah. Well, listen up, Einstein.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.160
It's not polite to disrespect
other people's gifts.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.680
Especially when you're giving away trash
you found in your backyard.

27:34.760 --> 27:39.520
[in Norwegian]
Well, I think both gifts are nice.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.120
- Now, who wants some cake?
- [boys exclaiming]

27:43.200 --> 27:44.960
I'll get the cake.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.120
Listen.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.760
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.800
[in English] Okay.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.800
Maybe this isn't
the right time or place, I just...

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
need to tell you, I, uh--

28:16.800 --> 28:18.560
[in Norwegian]
Bang-bang, you're dead!

28:18.640 --> 28:20.200
Goodness me...

28:20.280 --> 28:23.200
Lie down. Lie down, I said.

28:23.280 --> 28:28.040
You're dead, I said.
So lie down on the floor!

28:28.120 --> 28:31.720
Help. Now I'm dead.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.640
[groaning]

28:36.600 --> 28:38.720
Oh...

28:38.800 --> 28:39.840
[exhales deeply]

28:39.920 --> 28:42.680
I just got a little dizzy.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.440
[in English] Try and take it easy.
Try and take it easy.

28:45.520 --> 28:49.200
[Embrik screaming]

28:49.280 --> 28:52.080
[speaking Italian]
Madonna mia!

28:52.160 --> 28:56.880
I'll tell you one thing, that's the reason
why I never wanted to have kids.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.360
So, what'd you want to talk about?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.720
Hmm?

29:03.800 --> 29:06.640
You know, you started to say something...

29:06.720 --> 29:08.920
[in Norwegian] No, no.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.240
[in English]
It wasn't anything important.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.960
I hope for your sake
that Embryo brat's not staying over.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.600
[in Norwegian]
I promised to drop him off.

29:21.680 --> 29:26.200
[in English] And he lives all the way up
at that Farm Shop at Ringsaker. You know?

29:26.280 --> 29:28.600
Hmm. I know it.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.320
- [in Norwegian]   Mom.
-  Hi.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.840
Geez.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.840
- A taxi?
- Johnny gave me a lift.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.280
- Who's Johnny?
- Jonas' stepfather.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.320
I didn't know Sigrid had a boyfriend.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.400
He's English.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.240
He says hi. He told me to ask you
about the farm.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.600
I want you to stay far away from that man.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.360
You're dead, Mom.

29:57.440 --> 30:01.040
Where did you get that?
You can't play with that sort of thing!

30:09.080 --> 30:12.080
[door opens, closes]

30:15.640 --> 30:18.080
[inhales deeply]

30:19.840 --> 30:22.200
That smell is familiar.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.160
Macchiato?

30:25.240 --> 30:28.360
Remember how we used to sit
at Fru Hagen on Sunday mornings

30:28.440 --> 30:31.360
and drink cafe lattes
and read newspapers?

30:31.440 --> 30:35.120
Siw, what's gotten into you?

30:35.200 --> 30:37.160
[sighs]

30:37.240 --> 30:40.160
This country life.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.040
It didn't turn out
the way we planned.

30:44.360 --> 30:49.000
We knew it would be hard
in the beginning.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.920
Hard?
People here don't like us.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.640
It's affecting Embrik as well.
He didn't behave like this in Oslo.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.080
I think you should accept that offer.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.280
[scoffs]

31:03.200 --> 31:06.920
I'll take the kids back to Grünerløkka
and you can come if you want.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.560
Siw?

31:09.680 --> 31:10.760
Siw!

31:10.840 --> 31:12.480
[door opens, closes]

31:30.240 --> 31:33.240
[Dag] To find the place,
you use two fingers,

31:33.320 --> 31:37.160
feel the upper bone here, compress...

31:43.160 --> 31:45.640
You do that 30 times,
and then blow.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.160
[in English]
I hope this means what I think it means.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.080
Your partner told me
where I could find you, so...

32:13.440 --> 32:15.520
You will have the money by Friday,
my friend.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.000
Okay, okay.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.120
You're doing the right thing here.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.040
By the way...

32:22.440 --> 32:25.320
The kid's toy pistol.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.600
I'll get it back to him.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.800
All right.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.120
Oh...

32:32.200 --> 32:35.720
By the way,
what happened to Gandhi

32:35.800 --> 32:40.440
and "be the change you want in the world"
and all that?

32:44.160 --> 32:48.440
[in Norwegian] I've calculated the costs
of postponing the project.

32:57.040 --> 33:03.120
Yeah, it isn't exactly a fun read.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.120
We're very busy at the moment.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.400
We're busy.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.720
[in English] We're busy.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.560
Oh, yeah? Well, you might want to find
room on the agenda for this.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.600
[in Norwegian] What the hell?

33:26.120 --> 33:28.280
You got the hippy to sell his farm?

33:28.360 --> 33:31.320
[in English]
I told you I would, didn't I?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.360
[laughs]

33:36.440 --> 33:39.320
Johnny Henriksen, I love you.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.960
Whoa! Take it easy.
Take it easy now, big guy.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.040
Easy?

33:44.120 --> 33:45.960
Do you know what this means?

33:46.040 --> 33:50.000
[in Norwegian] Now we can start the sales
with a blast at the Birkebeiner race.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.120
[in English]
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.920
[in Norwegian]
What do you mean?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.800
[in English]
Are there any special terms?

34:00.880 --> 34:04.720
No, just gotta to make a deal
with the new owner.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.480
You own it?

34:07.560 --> 34:11.120
[in Norwegian]
Aren't we the ones buying?

34:11.200 --> 34:13.040
[in English] Not exactly.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.800
Technically, he left it in my name

34:16.880 --> 34:20.600
and I made the deposit, so...

34:20.680 --> 34:24.640
I guess it's my property.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.560
[in Norwegian] But didn't we agree
that you should get the penthouse?

34:27.640 --> 34:31.160
[in English]
Yeah, the penthouse is still good.

34:31.240 --> 34:34.440
But lately, I've been getting
a little concerned about the environment.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.080
What?

34:36.920 --> 34:39.000
[in English] So, what do you want?

34:39.080 --> 34:43.880
Well, for instance, if I was to be made
partner in the Belleview project,

34:43.960 --> 34:48.000
I suppose that would alleviate
my environmental concerns.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.400
[in Norwegian on PA]  There is
a special offer on deer sausage

34:56.480 --> 34:59.080
and moose sausage
at Gausdal General Store.

34:59.160 --> 35:02.080
You get two for one on deer sausage
and moose sausage.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.560
Welcome.

35:03.640 --> 35:07.040
Thomas, you must meet
our new partner properly.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.520
Oh!

35:08.600 --> 35:10.160
Why, hello.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.760
[in English]
We go way back. Winter sports.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.280
Okay, that's nice.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.640
[in Norwegian] Sure.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.880
- [in English] Pamphlets turned out good.
- Thank you. Glad you like it.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.440
Yeah.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.240
- By the way...
- Hmm?

35:28.320 --> 35:32.640
You sure he's not too...
How can I put this?

35:32.720 --> 35:34.920
...thirsty for the job?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.400
Well, he's a party guy,
but he can sell camel shit to the Arabs.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.240
He gets the job done.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.680
Here you go.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.320
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.120
- To camel shit.
- To camel shit!

35:48.200 --> 35:49.960
Okay.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.920
[man announcing on PA]

35:56.000 --> 35:58.120
Hello, hello, hello!

35:58.200 --> 35:59.800
[in Norwegian] Welcome.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.880
A little refreshment.
For you, too.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.280
This is a rare opportunity.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.360
Sjusjøen Belleview.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.920
[in English] Yes.

36:17.440 --> 36:21.520
[in Norwegian]
Don't forget the outdoor jacuzzi.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.880
I tried it myself, and I promise you...

36:24.960 --> 36:27.280
Starting at 3.8 million.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.800
But you get a lot for the money.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.680
I don't know if we can afford that.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.520
Now.

36:42.880 --> 36:47.600
With that gorgeous wife, you have to act.
What's your email?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.240
DagSolstad@kjoereskole.no.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.280
- Okay. Dag Solstad.
- Yvonne, Yvonne.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.560
[in English]
So, Mr. Driving Instructor.

37:00.640 --> 37:04.520
Call me crazy, but it looked like
your wife wanted a condo.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.720
[in Norwegian] You got that?

37:07.800 --> 37:10.600
[in English] I can make it happen.

37:10.680 --> 37:11.680
Yeah?

37:11.760 --> 37:15.480
Yeah, I'm one of the owners.
Get you a great deal.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.920
Just need a little something in return.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.800
A little something?

37:23.880 --> 37:27.880
A laminated something that says
I can drive in Norway.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.920
[in Norwegian]
Well, that's not really by the book.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.640
[in English] The book, the book.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.880
Always the book.

37:40.960 --> 37:45.040
You think that pretty little wife of yours
cares about the book?

37:48.760 --> 37:50.840
Okay.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.960
If you can give me a good deal,
a very good deal,

37:55.040 --> 38:00.320
I can talk to a... [in Norwegian]
buddy at the traffic authority.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.680
[in English] You got it.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.360
- [in Norwegian] Hey there.
-  Hi.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.960
Waffle?

38:46.040 --> 38:48.920
No, thanks.
I have snacks in my spare time.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.240
Look here.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.440
So that I can reach you
if a situation arises.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.240
Radio contact?
Is that really necessary?

38:55.320 --> 38:59.040
Communication is one of the most important
weapons we've got in the war on terror.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.400
Now, don't talk like that.
People might get scared.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.400
Can I have two hot dogs?

39:06.480 --> 39:08.720
Of course.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.200
Excuse me, but aren't you
in charge of zone three?

39:15.280 --> 39:20.080
Yes. But I can't do my job if I'm hungry.

39:24.360 --> 39:28.240
We don't leave our post
just because our stomach starts rumbling.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.320

- Hi.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.480

Nice of you to come.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.320
[in English]
Yeah, sure.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.440
Alpha to Bravo.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.840
Alpha to Bravo.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.800
[in Norwegian]
Has the eagle landed?

40:01.880 --> 40:04.640
[laughing, chatting]

40:04.720 --> 40:08.880
For God's sake... Is the minister
on his way into the stadium?

40:08.960 --> 40:11.000
[radio feedback whines]

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
Stupid idiot.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.920
[in English] Jonas here?

40:15.000 --> 40:18.400
[in Norwegian] Yes, he just went to get
something to drink.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.800
Good, I wanted to give this back to him.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.520
[chanting in Norwegian]

40:31.840 --> 40:36.240
Alpha to all units! Hit man observed
near finish line! This is not a drill.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.120
[on radio]  I repeat:
This is not a drill!

40:39.200 --> 40:42.120
Fucking hell.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.480
What's that you're saying?

40:44.560 --> 40:47.200
I got a visual on Henriksen with a pistol!

40:47.280 --> 40:52.360
Code red! Do not let the minister of
justice into the run to the finish line!

40:52.440 --> 40:54.480
Are you serious?

40:54.560 --> 40:59.040
For God's sake, Laila! Do you want to be
responsible for the minister's death?

41:02.440 --> 41:04.960
Get out of the way!

41:08.560 --> 41:10.920
[chanting]

41:11.000 --> 41:14.560
Drop the weapon!

41:14.640 --> 41:17.120
[in English] Get off me, you lunatic.
It's a toy.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.840
Oh, yeah, right!

41:21.640 --> 41:24.640
[in Norwegian]
Stop, stop, stop.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.640
What are you doing?

41:28.760 --> 41:32.720
We have identified a security risk
at the stadium. You'll have to wait.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.760
Is this one of yours?

41:34.840 --> 41:38.360
Hope you know what you're doing, Hovland.
We've only got minutes to win the badge.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.760
Hovland to Tvedt, over.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.880
It's just a toy gun!

41:43.960 --> 41:45.480
What are you doing?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.880
What the fuck are you looking at?

42:03.440 --> 42:07.400
Alpha to Hovland.
Abort operation. False alarm.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.520
False alarm, you say?

42:09.600 --> 42:13.360
I repeat: abort operation.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.920
This, Laila...

42:17.000 --> 42:19.600
I'm sorry.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.840
Fuck, fuck.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.800
Congratulations!
We just missed the badge.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.880
Six months of blood,
sweat and tears right down the drain.

42:52.960 --> 42:56.320
We are so sorry for this, Arve.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.360
Sorry? And you,

42:59.440 --> 43:02.360
Elvis, I heard you attacked an innocent
class of immigrants

43:02.440 --> 43:06.760
here to learn about Norwegian culture.

43:06.840 --> 43:11.240
But, listen. He was a suspect,
and he had a weapon.

43:11.320 --> 43:16.920
Enough! You'll get plenty
of opportunities to explain.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.480
The minister of justice is furious, so
there will be an internal investigation.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.360
[speaks indistinctly]

43:34.840 --> 43:37.480
- [Sigrid] You okay?
- [in English] It's all right.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.480
- Do you want some tea?
- Yeah.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.760
Actually, you got any aspirin?

43:43.840 --> 43:45.800
[in Norwegian] I think I have
some in my purse.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.760
[in English]
It's in my purse.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.160
The purse.
