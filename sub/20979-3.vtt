First, we had that pop quiz at school.

This was the worst day

- Bye.

but also far away.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.527

04:45.160 --> 04:46.244

please demonstrate.

Oh, who, me?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.240
[screams]

05:24.074 --> 05:27.452
It gets better after a while,
but then, it gets way worse,

05:27.536 --> 05:30.497
so you kinda break even in the end.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.419
There you are.
Why didn't you come home after school?

05:36.503 --> 05:40.173

or at least chewed up a little.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.717

you're swapping messages with

05:51.268 --> 05:52.602
is even human?

05:52.686 --> 05:57.190
What if they're an animal, like a fishcat?
You could be getting fishcatted.

05:57.274 --> 06:02.404
Please, my pit pal's not an animal.
He's a boy. He just told me.

Oh, he's so thoughtful and cute.

and you need someone to talk to, but...

06:12.622 --> 06:15.041
Hey, is that supposed to be me?

06:15.125 --> 06:17.836

06:57.876 --> 06:59.544
Lerk, can you do me a favor?

06:59.628 --> 07:01.880
- Anything. You want my foot?
- I'm good.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.841
Can you go to the gorge
and pig rat this to my pit pal?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.802
My mom doesn't approve
so she's watching me like a hawk snake.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.764
To sneak over here,
I had to tell her I needed to hurl.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.898
So?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.275
Uh, sure, Eep.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.612
It's just, I'm worried
you might be getting a bit obsessed,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.782
and obsessing over people is not healthy.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.200
Did you grow a new eyelash?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.827
[gasps] Hi there, lashy!

07:33.745 --> 07:36.748
- What are you talking about?
- You seem less Eep-y.

Agh! Just do this for me, okay?
I gotta go.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.471
All better, Mom!

07:51.554 --> 07:55.266

could make you so sick?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.162
Okay, he's probably not a fishcat.

and make sure he isn't trouble.

Okay, yes, he ate Not Food,
but that was a while ago.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.455
He's changed.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.248

11:23.725 --> 11:24.559
[sighs]

11:24.642 --> 11:26.102
This girl seems so cool.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.980
Wonder if I'll ever meet her.
What do you think?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.399
Da-da-da!

11:31.482 --> 11:33.109
You always say that.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.237
[music playing]

11:41.326 --> 11:42.243
Mmm.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.623
This buffalippo tastes so good.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.126
I want seconds. [chuckles]

11:50.793 --> 11:53.379
Aw, Mom, can we move over there?

11:53.463 --> 11:57.675
The whole point of going out to eat
is to intimidate predators.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.469
- We're intimidating.
- [Thunk] Yum, yum.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.221
Watch as I lord my clear superiority
over you.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.473
[squawks]

12:03.556 --> 12:05.141
[Thunk yelling]

12:06.684 --> 12:08.186
Intimidating-ish.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.039
Sorry, but taunting buffalippo
is dangerous.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.523
- Not until you're more grown up.
- Come on!

12:12.607 --> 12:14.484
Bulk's younger than me,
and he's doing fine...

12:14.567 --> 12:15.669
- [bellowing]
- [Bulk whimpering]

12:15.693 --> 12:17.862
Ah...!
[chuckles]

12:18.363 --> 12:21.783
Ptoo! Kids these days.
Intimidating animals.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.286
In <i>my </i> day,
all we had to intimidate were rocks.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.829
- Humph!
- [scrapes]

12:27.997 --> 12:29.916
I'm on to you.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
[groans, grunts]

12:31.042 --> 12:36.631
And back then, we didn't sass our elders,
mostly 'cause they died young. Still.

12:37.090 --> 12:37.924
Whoa!

12:38.007 --> 12:41.552
Mom, you know bitter reminiscing
attracts lizvults.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.764
Is this it? Is Gran getting taken
to Old People Island?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.533
- I always thought I'd go first.
- [Gran screaming]

12:46.557 --> 12:52.480
There, there, young Thunk.
Gran will always be here in our hearts.

12:52.563 --> 12:57.068
Gee, I'm being real grown-up
about this, huh, Mom?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.403
[grunts]

12:58.486 --> 13:00.405
Gran is not getting dragged off anywhere.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.781
[lizvult screeches]

13:01.864 --> 13:03.032
Ugh!

13:03.116 --> 13:04.659
[groans]

13:05.201 --> 13:10.164
See? It's dangerous out there.
Why go looking for more danger?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.082
[Gran sighs]

13:11.165 --> 13:12.667
Uh, Mom, you okay?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.085
[gasps] Oh!

13:14.168 --> 13:15.920
That was a lizvult.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.507
Lizvults only pick on the oldest of farts.

13:19.966 --> 13:20.966
[others humming]

13:21.009 --> 13:23.511
That's where you say I ain't that old!

13:23.594 --> 13:27.515
Oh! My family won't even
lie to me anymore.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.225
I <i>am </i> that old.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.601
[Thunk yawns]

13:30.685 --> 13:32.729
- Morning, Gran.
- [Gran mutters]

13:32.812 --> 13:34.981
Hey, aren't you gonna sharpen
your tooth with us?

13:35.064 --> 13:38.526
Why? Won't need teeth
on Old People Island.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.111
All they eat is moss.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.740
Aw, don't say that, Mom.
What if you wanna bite someone?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.616
Good point, Ugga.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.787
I don't tell you often enough,
but you're not awful.

13:49.871 --> 13:55.209
You know, if I am gonna go soon,
I wanna give you your death gift.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.627
[nervous chuckle]

13:56.711 --> 13:59.630
What's a death gift?
Please say it's just a clever name.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.176
Oh, it's something an older family member
leaves behind when they're gone.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.555
Sometimes it's sweet,
sometimes it's revenge.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.807
Well, mine is mostly sweet.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.851
A hidden treasure passed down

14:11.934 --> 14:14.896
to the women in this family
for generations.

14:14.979 --> 14:20.318
But beware. It's protected by booby traps,
each boobier than the last.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.697
Had to keep the weirdos away.
Also, had a lot of time on my hands.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.534
Booby traps? Like the ones guarding
your aged smash fruits?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.161
- [babbling]
- [splashes]

14:30.244 --> 14:31.244
[whimpers]

14:31.287 --> 14:33.039
[screeches]

14:33.122 --> 14:36.918
- Yeah, I'll pass.
- Oh, I understand.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.961
- Eep, you can have it.
- [gasps]

14:39.045 --> 14:40.797
[groans] Ow!

14:40.880 --> 14:42.340
Ha! And yes.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.175
Hold on. No way.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.761
Eep, did you miss the part
about the booby traps?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.222
Oh, Eep's grown-up enough to handle 'em.

14:49.305 --> 14:53.059
Here's a map to two halves of another map.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.228
I might have gone overboard in hiding it.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.314
Put 'em together to find
where I hid my treasure,

14:58.564 --> 15:02.276
because I do <i>not </i> remember. At all.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.070
- [Eep laughing]
- Good luck.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.157
- Booby traps, here I come.
- Not alone, you don't. Slow down.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.410
Sandy, Mommy needs a power boost.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.661
- [snaps]
- [screams]

15:13.037 --> 15:15.540
Well, Thunk, there it goes.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.084
My death gift has been passed on.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.877
- Oh, this is for you.
- [gasps]

15:19.961 --> 15:23.673
Finally, something to challenge
a mind as sharp as mine.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.842
- [twangs]
- Boop, boop, boop, boop...

15:26.259 --> 15:29.303
You know, ever since that lizvult,
I've been thinking.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.806
How old am I really?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.891
It's hard to know
how much time you got left

15:33.975 --> 15:36.060
when you don't know
how much is behind you.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.061
- [twangs]
- Boop...

15:37.145 --> 15:39.063
Ooh! I have an idea.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.420
- [twangs]
- Boop, boop, boop, boop...

15:41.482 --> 15:44.819
Thunk, that idea of yours...?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.864
I have another idea,
and this one relates to your problem.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.075
[gasps]

15:51.159 --> 15:54.745
Now hold on. Before we go after that map,
we need our floaties.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.081
[Eep] Don't worry, Mom. I've got this.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.167
[gasps] Eep, don't!

16:01.461 --> 16:02.461
No!

16:04.589 --> 16:05.423
Whew.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.717
Ta-da! Huh?

16:09.552 --> 16:10.803
[grunts]

16:11.304 --> 16:15.683
Eep, swim right. No, your right.
No, my "your right."

16:15.766 --> 16:18.644
Mom, quit backseat diving!

16:18.728 --> 16:19.770
[hissing]

16:19.854 --> 16:21.189
- [gasps]
- [groans]

16:21.272 --> 16:22.272
[screams]

16:27.195 --> 16:29.030
[sighs] Whew.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.283
[laughs] One-half down.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.409
[laughing]

16:33.493 --> 16:34.577
[gasps]

16:35.036 --> 16:38.498
And it only took 19 moons off my life.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.750
Ha. The other half.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.127
- Better hop to it.
- Wait, Eep, don't.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.712
What if it's booby trapped again?

16:44.795 --> 16:48.299
Oh, I'm being ridiculous.
It's definitely booby trapped.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.468
Looks okay to me.

16:50.718 --> 16:55.848
Still, no need to rush.
There's always time to be careful.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.643
- [gasps]
- [faint bubbling]

16:58.726 --> 17:00.228
Except now. Rush, rush.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.314
Forget that slate. Can you not hear me?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.857
[grunts]

17:07.859 --> 17:09.987
Well, don't... uh...

17:10.070 --> 17:11.989
Thank goodness I was here.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.366
[Old Man Root humming]

17:14.909 --> 17:17.161
So, what's he doing exactly,

17:17.244 --> 17:20.540
besides making me wish
I'd lost even more of my hearing?

17:20.623 --> 17:24.919
Uh, I don't know. But Old Man Root
is an expert in old weird stuff.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.506
Uh... which doesn't apply to you at all.

17:28.756 --> 17:29.966
Saved it, Thunk, yeah.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.634
I'm studying your energy.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.885
- [sniffs]
- Ugh!

17:32.969 --> 17:35.346
Breathing in your essence and...

17:35.429 --> 17:36.305
Ow!

17:36.389 --> 17:39.934
How's that supposed to tell you
how old I am?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.144
Oh, it's not. This is for my bald spot.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.105
As for determining your age,

17:44.188 --> 17:46.566
just do what I do with the trees
and count your rings...

17:46.649 --> 17:48.359
Er, wrinkles.

17:48.442 --> 17:53.197
Count all of Gran's wrinkles. Huh.
Well, I better free up my afternoon.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.035
[Eep gasps]

17:58.119 --> 17:58.953
Yep, it matches.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.538
[laughing]

18:00.621 --> 18:04.542
Yes! We found Gran's treasure!

18:04.625 --> 18:05.751
[Eep laughing]

18:05.835 --> 18:08.296
Ooh, we don't know who chewed those last.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.382
Well, the satisfaction of finding it
is good enough for me.

18:11.465 --> 18:15.595
Aw, come on. It's just a deep, dark hole
full of bones and moaning echoes.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.971
[screeching]

18:21.017 --> 18:23.519
So there's a few less traps now.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.064
Yeah, this just isn't worth it.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.860
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
We can't give up now, okay?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.362
Don't you want to know
what Gran's treasure is?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.572
It could be...

18:34.864 --> 18:37.950
Actually, I have no idea what it could be.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.077
[yells] Which is why I need to see it!

18:40.161 --> 18:43.748
Eep, this kind of behavior
proves you're not grown up enough to...

18:43.831 --> 18:46.292
Ow! Owie-owie-owie-ow-ee!

18:46.375 --> 18:47.918
[wails] Mom!

18:48.002 --> 18:49.879
I cut myself.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.007
Ooh, Mama will bandage that
boo-boo right up, baby.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.884
Mommy, yeah.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.135
[sighs]

18:56.218 --> 18:57.219
[mutters]

18:57.303 --> 18:58.929
Don't judge me, Sandy.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.015
You know you wanna see
Gran's treasure, too.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.516
[babbles]

19:04.018 --> 19:08.606
All right, Thunk, let's settle this
once and for all. Get counting.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.609
Okay, I'll just start at the top wrinkle

19:11.692 --> 19:15.279
and work my way down.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.490
Wow!

19:18.532 --> 19:19.825
I don't believe it.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.744
Just give it to me straight, boy.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.704
I can take it.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.874
Ah, who am I kidding? No, I can't.
Keep your mouth shut.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.169
No, it turns out
you don't have tons of wrinkles.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.339
You have one big wrinkle
covering your whole body.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.508
[gasps]
One wrinkle?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.634
[hoots]

19:36.717 --> 19:39.136
Thunk, do you know what that means?

19:39.220 --> 19:43.140
I'm only one moon old.
Why, I'm practically a baby.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.976
No wonder I like being carried around.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.397
Uh, that can't be right.
I'm older than that.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.651
- You're way older than...
- I'm... one... moon... old.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.987
Now let's go. Baby Granny's hungy.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.656
Yes, Grandmother.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.159
Gran's death gift has gotta be down here.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.077
Dah-hh!

20:03.160 --> 20:05.371
Egg marks the spot!

20:05.454 --> 20:06.997
[squeals]

20:07.957 --> 20:11.752
I don't care what Mom said.
She treats us like babies.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.295
[Sandy grunts]

20:14.088 --> 20:16.257
Okay, you're a baby, but I'm not.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.050
[Ugga] Stop right now, little ladies.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.134
Ugh!

20:20.219 --> 20:21.512
[Eep panting]

20:21.595 --> 20:24.223
Eep, don't. I should've just made
"don't" your middle name

20:24.306 --> 20:26.308
because you're always walking
right into...

20:26.392 --> 20:27.309
[rumbles]

20:27.393 --> 20:29.311
trouble. [gasps]

20:29.437 --> 20:30.437
Eh...?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.399
[buzzing]

20:33.482 --> 20:34.525
[yells]

20:35.609 --> 20:38.779
Eep, one of those vines
must be holding up the buzztle nest.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.030
You gotta cut it.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.492
But... what if I cut your vine?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.370
No, I can't. I can't. You were right.
I'm not ready for this.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.789
[Ugga] Eep, look at me!

20:48.873 --> 20:49.707
[winces]

20:49.790 --> 20:53.669
Ignore the buzztle stings.
You can do this.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.590
Your growing up scares me,
but I never should've doubted you.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.343
Now come on and save us
before my face turns into one giant welt!

21:01.427 --> 21:05.347
Okay. Okay. Here goes.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.807
[gnawing]

21:08.142 --> 21:09.018
[gasps]

21:09.101 --> 21:10.269
Uh...

21:11.103 --> 21:12.103
[gnawing]

21:12.813 --> 21:13.981
[screeches]

21:14.064 --> 21:15.107
[groans]

21:15.983 --> 21:17.234
[moans]

21:17.318 --> 21:18.318
- [buzzing]
- [gulps]

21:19.445 --> 21:20.321
[groans]

21:20.404 --> 21:21.697
[gnawing]

21:21.781 --> 21:22.781
[snaps]

21:25.576 --> 21:26.744
[grunts]

21:26.827 --> 21:27.661
[Eep moans] Oh...!

21:27.745 --> 21:30.247
So, tell me. How's it look?

21:30.331 --> 21:31.999
Uh...

21:32.082 --> 21:33.125
[pops]

21:33.209 --> 21:34.668
[chuckles]

21:34.752 --> 21:37.880
- Let's go home.
- We made it all this way.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.341
Don't you wanna see
what's behind that door?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.009
[sighs]

21:42.092 --> 21:43.092
Mm-hmm.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.054
[both grunting]

21:45.137 --> 21:47.056
[gasps]

21:47.139 --> 21:48.766
[sucking]

21:49.099 --> 21:50.726
Baby still hungy.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.103
[sucking]

21:53.187 --> 21:54.522
- Gran?
- Mom?

21:55.606 --> 21:59.151
Hey, kiddos. I remembered
where I stashed my treasure,

21:59.235 --> 22:01.487
and that there was a back way in.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.241
Good news!
Turns out I'm only one moon old.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.367
Uh...

22:06.450 --> 22:07.701
[whispers] Just go with it.

22:07.785 --> 22:11.831
Uh, happy first birth moon, Gran.

22:11.914 --> 22:16.085
But did you have to celebrate
by eating up my death gifts?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.796
Oh, it's not the eggs. It's this.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.507
[Eep] Huh? A picture of you?

22:21.590 --> 22:26.387
Oh, not me. That's your
great-great-great-not-so-great gran.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.348
All the women in our family
look like this eventually.

22:29.431 --> 22:33.561
You can hang this in the cave
to remind you of your future.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.271
[shudders] Ugh!

22:35.354 --> 22:38.357
Actually, Mom,
I don't think Eep's old enough yet.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.902
[Gran] Oh, yeah. Hot-cha-cha-cha!

22:41.986 --> 22:43.320
[music playing]
