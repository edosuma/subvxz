[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.353
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.616
I like to date
more than one person at once.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.183
You're free
to see other people, too.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.576
Did you hire someone
to look into my past?

00:11.663 --> 00:14.144
Do you have a Lily Bass Dossier?

00:14.231 --> 00:15.711
- Lily..
- 'I wanna see it.'

00:15.798 --> 00:17.234
I won't put my name
on a piece of paper

00:17.321 --> 00:18.757
condoning who you've become.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
Then I'll just have
to find another way.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.109
Well, you have one other option.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.893
You could file a suit
to become emancipated.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.155
You mean divorce my parents?

00:25.242 --> 00:26.200
The captain is being charged

00:26.287 --> 00:28.332
with embezzlement and fraud.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.768
You're skipping town?

00:29.855 --> 00:31.205
I'm gonna be
a much better father to you

00:31.292 --> 00:33.076
from Dominica
than I will be from jail.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.079
Where is she..

00:36.166 --> 00:37.689
And who am I?

00:37.776 --> 00:39.648
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.868
You know you love me.

00:42.955 --> 00:46.742
X-O-X-O, Gossip Girl.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.091
[Gossip Girl]
For the rest of the country

00:48.178 --> 00:49.658
Thanksgiving is when families

00:49.745 --> 00:51.790
come together to give thanks

00:51.877 --> 00:53.314
but on the upper east side

00:53.401 --> 00:56.317
the holiday thankfully
returns to its roots

00:56.404 --> 00:59.494
lying, manipulation
and betrayal.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.062
And from what we hear
just like the Indians

01:02.149 --> 01:04.368
someone else is being pushed
out of their home.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.675
Not only are Cyrus'
moving boxes everywhere,

01:06.762 --> 01:08.416
but so are
his annoying relatives.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.765
But they can't be that bad.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.288
Aaron always talks
about his nana.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.116
Oh, Sylvia? You know,
she kissed me on the cheek.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.640
She left a big,
orange lipstick mark.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.468
It looked like
I'd been spray-tanned.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.644
And Cyrus' nephew spent
the morning talking to me

01:19.731 --> 01:23.257
about corn,grain of the future.

01:23.344 --> 01:26.129
And his sister asked me
to go shopping with her.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.479
- Oh, that's sweet.
- At century 21.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.438
Ugh. The horror.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.745
But even though daddy
isn't coming

01:33.832 --> 01:35.182
I'm determined to have

01:35.269 --> 01:37.793
the perfect thanksgiving
I didn't get last year.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.534
You're still gonna help me
make his famous pie tomorrow?

01:39.621 --> 01:41.536
Yeah, but I can only stay
for a couple hours.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.928
Aaron is coming
to meet my family

01:43.015 --> 01:44.713
before Thanksgiving dinner.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.541
And how do you plan
to introduce him?

01:46.628 --> 01:50.240
"Mom, you DVR.
"Big Love," this is Aaron

01:50.327 --> 01:51.850
"and he's just like Bill Paxton

01:51.937 --> 01:54.026
"only younger and with scruff."

01:54.114 --> 01:57.726
I'm serious. The Serena I know
would never wanna share

01:57.813 --> 01:59.554
a guy she really liked
with anyone else.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.556
Well, I'll admit,
it's been hard.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.515
I-I like him enough that
I don't wanna date anyone else.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.735
And you can't get the prize
if you don't compete, right?

02:06.822 --> 02:09.955
There's so many things wrong
with that sentence.

02:10.042 --> 02:14.395
Ugh. Here comes your ghost
of boyfriends past to haunt me.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.441
- Please try to be civil.
- Okay.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.747
Hey, have either
of you seen Jenny?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.792
Oh, if she's hiding from you

02:20.879 --> 02:22.011
she has better taste
than I thought.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.101
I tried.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.016
My dad has been
calling her cell

02:27.103 --> 02:28.626
and he's been trying
her friend Agnes' place

02:28.713 --> 02:30.498
and she's just not returning
any of his messages.

02:30.585 --> 02:31.890
I was looking for Eric.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.805
Um, the headmaster said
he left early, so..

02:33.892 --> 02:35.111
Well, she has been
spending a lot of time

02:35.198 --> 02:36.895
with him over at the apartment.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.202
Well, look, if you see her,
could you please just tell her

02:39.289 --> 02:41.596
to call us back, because I would
love this cold war of theirs

02:41.683 --> 02:44.120
to end before the holidays.
Speaking of..

02:44.207 --> 02:45.687
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.775
You, too.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.342
I'm gonna miss your dad's

02:48.429 --> 02:50.866
mashed potatoes,
but not the drama.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.521
Yeah, well, this year's gonna
be a little quieter, I guess

02:53.608 --> 02:56.001
especially
if Jenny doesn't show.

02:56.088 --> 02:59.614
Uh, I-I guess
I'll see you after the break.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.529
Yeah. Bye.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.704
Bye.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.402
[instrumental music]

03:05.489 --> 03:06.664
Oh, sorry.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.013
Not as sorry as I am.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.280
Archibald, I haven't seen
you around here lately.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.238
- Why do you care?
- Oh, I don't.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.848
If you're not
with the Humphreys anymore

03:16.935 --> 03:20.112
obviously things are
looking up, which is too bad.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.332
I kind of liked
watching you slum it.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.378
I thought it would teach you
who your real friends were.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.293
Well, I guess it has.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.561
I need to be sure you understand
what emancipation means.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.171
I do. I've been researching it.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.999
She's made me watch
"Irreconcilable Differences"

03:37.086 --> 03:39.175
like, 15 times.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.656
Once you file,
the state opens up

03:41.743 --> 03:43.397
an investigation
into your family.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.269
'There has to be proof
of parental neglect.'

03:46.356 --> 03:49.054
Just fill out these papers
authorizing the investigation.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.709
Once you sign them,
your parents will be notified.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
Wait. They have to be notified?

03:53.450 --> 03:54.973
Well, of course.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.802
They need to know you no longer
want to be their child.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.065
[instrumental music]

04:01.415 --> 04:03.199
Okay. Thank you.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.244
Let's go.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.638
[Dan]
'So what are you doing
for your holiday?'

04:07.725 --> 04:09.466
I decided to pass
on joining my family

04:09.553 --> 04:11.033
at the Washoe Reservation

04:11.120 --> 04:13.557
where they're helping
to stage a protest.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.212
And my plan is to hole
myself up in my studio

04:16.299 --> 04:17.953
rent "Berlin Alexanderplatz"

04:18.040 --> 04:20.477
and eat a frozen Annie's
organic turkey dinner.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.828
Oh! Well, God, you know, no one
enjoys a 16-hour German movie

04:23.915 --> 04:27.441
more than yours truly, but,
uh, you could come here instead.

04:27.528 --> 04:31.183
I don't really feel
like seeing Jenny.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.446
Well, I'm pretty sure
she's not coming

04:32.533 --> 04:34.012
so you can take her chair.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.405
I didn't realize
it was still that bad

04:35.492 --> 04:36.754
between her and your dad.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.844
Where is she having
Thanksgiving? With Nate?

04:39.931 --> 04:43.370
No, uh, Nate and Jenny aren't
spending time together anymore.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.154
Uh, so how about it?

04:45.241 --> 04:47.765
A Fassbinder and freezer-free
Thanksgiving at my place?

04:47.852 --> 04:49.332
Well, when you put it
that way...

04:49.419 --> 04:50.681
I know.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.379
Agnes' mother just
told me that Agnes

04:52.466 --> 04:53.902
is on a modeling
assignment in Tokyo

04:53.989 --> 04:54.990
and she hasn't seen
Jenny for a week.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.426
Then where is she?

04:56.513 --> 04:57.949
I don't know. I think
I have to call the cops.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.951
You know, uh, when I asked
Serena this afternoon

05:00.038 --> 05:01.649
she said that Jenny's

05:01.736 --> 05:04.478
been spending
a lot of time with Eric.

05:04.565 --> 05:08.917
Eric! Serena!
Charles! We're home!

05:09.004 --> 05:10.658
So much for coming home
a day early.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.833
We should have stayed
on Necker Island

05:11.920 --> 05:12.834
with Dick and Bono.

05:12.921 --> 05:13.878
Right?

05:16.098 --> 05:17.055
[ringing]

05:18.927 --> 05:19.971
[Rufus]
'Is my daughter there?'

05:20.058 --> 05:22.278
Well, Rufus, hello to you, too.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.194
No, no one's here. Why would you
think your daughter would be?

05:25.281 --> 05:27.327
- Is she with Eric?
- Well, I certainly hope so.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.937
I'm pretty sure she's been
with him all week.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.374
What do you mean, all week?

05:31.461 --> 05:34.072
What, you don't really
believe she's been staying..

05:34.159 --> 05:36.161
[instrumental music]

05:37.815 --> 05:39.077
I'm gonna call you right back.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.039
It was nice of the Roths
to let us stay at their place

05:44.126 --> 05:45.170
while they're in Aspen.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.215
Very.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.825
If they hadn't offered to help

05:47.912 --> 05:50.437
I'm not sure
what we would have done.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.787
We don't have a lot
of options left, Nate.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.136
Yeah, I kind of noticed.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.403
But I'm hoping
that is about to change.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.669
[dramatic music]

06:08.716 --> 06:10.544
Son, I missed you so much.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.241
[Gossip Girl]
Just like Nate Archibald

06:12.328 --> 06:15.113
Gossip Girl has a family
waiting for her today

06:15.200 --> 06:17.725
so although
I'd love to stay and chat

06:17.812 --> 06:20.989
I'm signing off until
after Thanksgiving dinner

06:21.076 --> 06:25.341
just in time for pie, coffee
and surveying the damage.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.519
[instrumental music]

06:29.606 --> 06:31.652
'My life in Dominica is..'

06:31.739 --> 06:33.262
Well, it's good.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.133
We moved some money
offshore before I left

06:35.220 --> 06:36.874
enough to get
a house on the ocean.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.833
Weather's always perfect.
People are nice.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.530
I'm so happy you're living
it up in the Caribbean

06:40.617 --> 06:42.532
while we're squatting
with no heat in New York.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.099
Hear your father out, Nate.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.145
I wanna make things better.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.496
I know how hard your life
has been because of what I did.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.628
I can't turn back the clock

06:51.715 --> 06:53.674
but I can ask you
to come live with me.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.981
All the money in the world
isn't worth it

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
without the two of you
to share it with.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.116
Mom, did you know about this?

07:01.203 --> 07:03.727
Yes, and I'd like to go

07:03.814 --> 07:06.513
but only if you
want to come, too.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.340
Please, Nate.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.212
We can be a family again.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.823
All you have to do is say yes.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.522
[instrumental music]

07:18.220 --> 07:20.352
I didn't know
she was there until today.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.572
I called Serena.
Shedidn't even know.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.357
Eric must have been
sneaking her in at night.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.576
Let's just go wait for her.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.143
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.971
The last time I saw
you and Jenny together

07:30.058 --> 07:31.668
it didn't go very well,
and you don't seem to have

07:31.755 --> 07:33.017
changed your mind
about anything.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.018
She's my daughter.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.106
If I wanna see her

07:35.193 --> 07:36.151
you're not gonna change my mind.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.239
I'm not trying to, it's just

07:37.326 --> 07:38.806
that I haven't seen Jenny yet.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.852
Let me talk to her,
see where her head is at.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.202
'If there's one thing I have
learned about teenage girls'

07:44.289 --> 07:46.204
is that sometimes
they need someone

07:46.291 --> 07:47.989
outside of their family
to talk to.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.730
A-all that might be true

07:49.817 --> 07:50.774
but it's Thanksgiving.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.384
Jenny needs to be with family.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.082
She is. She's with mine.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.694
Once you've calmed down,
and she's ready to talk

07:57.781 --> 07:59.043
I'll arrange a meeting.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.393
[dramatic music]

08:02.177 --> 08:03.134
Marshmallows.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.834
Jenny likes 'em on her,
uh, sweet potatoes.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.970
I'm so glad to have
the house to myself.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.059
Cyrus took my mother
to Jean-Georges for dinner.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.366
God knows why.
Where's Warren Jeffs?

08:17.453 --> 08:20.848
He's, um, making dinner for us

08:20.935 --> 08:23.720
which would be
completely romantic and amazing

08:23.807 --> 08:25.809
except when I asked him
where he was today

08:25.896 --> 08:28.508
he said he was hanging out
with a friend.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.422
I know I'm probably being
completely neurotic

08:30.510 --> 08:33.164
but all I could think of was,
was this friend a girl..

08:33.251 --> 08:34.383
A girl he kisses?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.254
'A woman needs to be with a man'

08:36.341 --> 08:37.386
who thinks of only her.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.127
Anything else is a nonstarter.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.520
Tell him how you feel.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.565
Dorota, more flour.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.175
Are you baking already?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.263
I thought we were supposed
to do that tomorrow.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.482
I needed a little tradition

08:46.569 --> 08:48.310
of my own to keep me grounded.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.182
It turns out the Rose family
has a restaurant Thanksgiving.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.663
You know, B,
the thing about traditions is

08:53.750 --> 08:55.709
you can make new ones.
For all you know

08:55.796 --> 08:58.799
you could like his family dinner
more than your own.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.322
[Aaron]
Ready.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.237
Oh. That's-that's my cue to go.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.413
Remember, Serena doesn't share.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.980
Remember, Blair should learn to.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.942
- Bart, you're home early.
- So are you.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.727
Chuck said he thought you were
going out with Jonathan tonight.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.425
Yeah, so did I. Huh.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.297
[instrumental music]

09:20.821 --> 09:23.214
So how were things
while we were away?

09:23.301 --> 09:24.520
Um..

09:24.607 --> 09:26.217
'...not so good.'

09:26.304 --> 09:27.654
I don't think it's working
out with Jonathan.

09:28.785 --> 09:29.699
Huh.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.571
[cellphone beeps]

09:33.834 --> 09:36.358
What do you know about someone
at your school named Ben Shurn?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.708
Um, he's the, uh..

09:38.795 --> 09:41.015
The-the captain
of Jonathan's swim team. Why?

09:41.102 --> 09:43.495
Just...maybe you might
want to ask Jonathan

09:43.583 --> 09:44.584
what he was doing Monday night.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.856
You're home.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.380
My plans for the evening
got held up at customs.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.903
Your dad just insinuated

09:59.990 --> 10:02.514
that Jonathan might be
dating someone else.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.691
How and why would he know that?

10:04.778 --> 10:07.215
He has a PI on retainer,
like I do.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.956
'I get that for business'

10:09.043 --> 10:13.134
but for family and friends
of family, it's just creepy.

10:13.221 --> 10:16.920
Not to worry. Bart's people
are top-notch and very discreet.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.531
At our old place, he had this
safe with files on everybody

10:19.619 --> 10:21.272
from staff to senators.

10:21.359 --> 10:25.102
When I was 13, I found the most
amazing surveillance photos

10:25.189 --> 10:28.628
of Gina, my hot Italian au pair.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.891
Those photos and Gina
changed my life.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.675
Yeah, but what if I don't
want my life to change?

10:32.762 --> 10:34.024
[instrumental music]

10:34.111 --> 10:36.636
What else does he know?

10:36.723 --> 10:38.289
How much do you wanna find out?

10:38.376 --> 10:41.858
♪ It's a bad man's world ♪

10:41.945 --> 10:44.600
♪ It's a bad man's world.. ♪

10:44.687 --> 10:47.081
This is so good.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.779
But candles and home cooking?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.128
What's with the romance?

10:51.215 --> 10:53.130
Bound to give the girl
the wrong idea.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.002
Well, or the right one.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.050
I've had an incredible time
with you these past few weeks.

11:00.137 --> 11:03.445
Honestly, uh,
you're all I ever think of.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.490
[laughs]
Really?

11:05.577 --> 11:07.623
Oh. I mean, that's flattering.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.626
[chuckles]
You're, of course,
welcome to see other people.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.714
That's your choice.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.629
But, uh, as of right now

11:13.716 --> 11:16.197
this moment I'm
officially a one-woman man.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.026
Wow.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.984
[laughs]
A one-woman man?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.899
If-if I would have known
we were celebrating

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
I would have brought
a bottle of champagne.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.469
Well, actually, I'm-I'm
kind of glad you didn't.

11:27.556 --> 11:30.080
Um, I also wanted
to talk to you

11:30.167 --> 11:32.604
about the fact that,
uh, I'm sober.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.258
- Oh.
- I feel a lot better.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.044
My-my work is a lot better
since I stopped drinking.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.568
I just need to be around
people that are gonna keep me

11:39.655 --> 11:42.963
on the right track, not tempt
me over to the dark side.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.486
The dark side. Right.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.530
[chuckles]

11:45.617 --> 11:47.358
[instrumental music]

11:47.445 --> 11:49.709
Well, I used to party..

11:49.796 --> 11:51.406
...every now and then.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.017
No. No. But that-that
was so long ago.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.715
So it's-it's, you know

11:55.802 --> 11:58.979
e-except for the occasional
celebratory glass of champagne

11:59.066 --> 12:01.242
I, um, I'm pretty much
a teetotaler now.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.678
So you can count on me.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.854
I'm-I'm the right girl
for the job.

12:04.941 --> 12:05.986
Well, I-I figured.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.380
The kids need to tell us
things whenthey happen

12:09.467 --> 12:10.425
not after they get caught.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.774
The only way to protect them

12:11.861 --> 12:13.471
is to know what they're
up to at all times.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.951
Don't you agree?

12:15.038 --> 12:18.738
Yes, but in this case,
it's complicated.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.696
Well, I certainly hope
you grounded Eric.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.220
Well, not yet, but..
Where are you off to?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.700
Uh, I just have to get to--

12:24.787 --> 12:26.484
To go find Jenny
and tell her that we know

12:26.571 --> 12:27.877
'she's been staying here?'

12:28.704 --> 12:29.923
Wow.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.272
How about you bring
her back here?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.056
Because I would love
to talk to her.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.144
[instrumental music]

12:40.237 --> 12:42.196
[instrumental music]

12:44.720 --> 12:46.678
Blair, this is delicious.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.378
'I must get the recipe.
But you know what?'

12:50.465 --> 12:54.817
The ratio of cinnamon
to nutmeg, not enough.

12:54.904 --> 12:55.818
[chuckles]

13:00.431 --> 13:01.824
- 'Mother?'
- Yes?

13:01.911 --> 13:04.392
Why are you letting Cyrus
ruin everything?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.698
It's all about his family
and his traditions

13:06.786 --> 13:08.352
and his notes on my pie.

13:08.439 --> 13:11.312
Oh, honey, calm down.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.184
You know, you always think
the-the worst of people.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.143
Cyrus made reservations
for dinner

13:16.230 --> 13:19.581
at yourfavorite restaurant,
the Gramercy Tavern.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.627
So he's having the chef
make your favorite recipes

13:22.714 --> 13:24.760
oyster stuffing that you like.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.588
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.068
That's not the point, mother.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.591
[whispering]
The point is that Thanksgiving

13:29.678 --> 13:31.375
is a family holiday

13:31.462 --> 13:33.769
and this is our family now.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.597
Now you get with
the program, and fast.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.862
I hope there's some
of that pie left for me.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.690
- 'Is there? Huh?'
- 'Oh! Oh!'

13:41.777 --> 13:42.822
- Gimme.
- Mmm!

13:42.909 --> 13:44.519
Mmm!

13:44.606 --> 13:47.261
[instrumental music]

13:47.348 --> 13:49.872
Dorota, everything's awful.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.918
I know thing you
want to know, Miss Blair

13:52.005 --> 13:53.702
but I not supposed to tell.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.052
Who do you work for? Spill it.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.361
Your mother make me
keep this safe until tomorrow.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.405
Keep what safe?

14:01.492 --> 14:02.450
[gasps]

14:04.191 --> 14:06.062
[gasps]

14:06.149 --> 14:09.022
Mr. Rose propose
this evening at dinner.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.806
They be telling
everyone at Thanksgiving

14:10.893 --> 14:12.286
when whole family is there.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.725
I saw your father today.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.292
Yeah, I had a feeling.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.381
I know you both need some time

14:20.468 --> 14:22.949
so I-I convinced him to let
you stay here for a while.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.473
And when you're ready, I would
love to help you talk to him

14:25.560 --> 14:27.214
and make things right.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.607
Thanks for the offer.
I really, I appreciate it

14:29.694 --> 14:32.610
but, um, you don't know
how he's been, so..

14:34.264 --> 14:35.483
Jenny, he's your father

14:35.570 --> 14:38.051
and he loves you so much.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.443
[dramatic music]

14:39.530 --> 14:41.358
And at least for
the next couple years

14:43.099 --> 14:44.448
you belong at home with him.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.190
Um..

14:47.277 --> 14:48.583
Thank you, Mrs. Bass

14:48.670 --> 14:51.107
for letting me stay
here and everything

14:51.194 --> 14:52.935
but I'm pretty tired, so I'm..

14:53.022 --> 14:55.895
okay, well, get some rest.
We can talk some more tomorrow.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.071
[sighs]

14:58.158 --> 14:59.202
Oh, Jenny..

15:00.638 --> 15:01.596
Ah.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.386
[music continues]

15:16.567 --> 15:18.830
[instrumental music]

15:18.918 --> 15:21.833
So you're okay with it, Jenny
not being with us tonight?

15:21.921 --> 15:24.532
If, uh, by okay, you mean
extraordinarily depressed

15:24.619 --> 15:28.318
then yes. I miss her a lot.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.972
You know, in the all arguments
you two have been having

15:30.059 --> 15:31.974
I haven't once heard you
tell her that.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.586
Oh, my God. You're right.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.240
It's not thatrare, is it?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.941
Aaron, what are you doing here?

15:42.028 --> 15:42.985
Uh, I live
right around the corner.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.030
I'm just picking something up

15:44.117 --> 15:45.901
to take to, um..

15:45.988 --> 15:48.121
Oh, no. It's-it's alright.
I can hear her name.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.122
Serena's.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.561
Uh, you know, I'm just gonna go

15:53.648 --> 15:55.345
and see if there
are any pecans left.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.696
So, um, you know,
could you do me a favor

15:58.783 --> 16:00.133
and say hi
to Serena's family for me?

16:00.220 --> 16:02.874
'Cause we all spent
last Thanksgiving together.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.919
Yeah, absolutely.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.007
Except Bart, actually.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.052
There was this, uh

16:06.139 --> 16:08.489
this crazy thing with, uh..

16:08.576 --> 16:11.274
...with my dad and her mom
and my mom, and it was..

16:11.361 --> 16:12.667
I guess like all things
in Serena's life

16:12.754 --> 16:13.929
it's very complicated.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.409
Serena's life is complicated?

16:15.496 --> 16:17.541
Uh, well, yeah.
I-I don't know about you

16:17.628 --> 16:19.369
but the Serena I know has
long, flowing blonde hair

16:19.456 --> 16:22.372
towers over both of us.
Is-is that the same one?

16:22.459 --> 16:25.158
I just don't see her
as complicated.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.683
So would you say that they're
cheddar people or more goat-y?

16:28.770 --> 16:30.163
Oh, Serena's not
that big into cheese.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.947
I think you might
wanna go with the, uh..

16:32.034 --> 16:33.731
Wines of Southern France.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.082
Well, I guess you don't know
her as well as you think you do.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.953
She doesn't drink anymore.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.868
Oh, sure. I mean,
not problematically, of course.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.697
I mean, at least not for months.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.307
Wait. Months?

16:44.394 --> 16:45.743
Yeah, well, y-you know,
the thing in the spring

16:45.830 --> 16:47.789
with Georgina?
You two are getting serious.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.921
I'm sure you guys
talked about that.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.316
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.275
Uh, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go pay for this.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.150
Mother, is there anything
you wanna tell me?

17:01.237 --> 17:02.717
Oh, yes, actually, there is

17:02.804 --> 17:05.807
and I will tell you
tonight at the restaurant

17:05.894 --> 17:08.027
once everyone is assembled
for dinner.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.724
Of all the things
you've done, mother

17:09.811 --> 17:12.727
this is one of the worst.
I'm your daughter.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.772
Lumping me in with everyone
else to hear the news?

17:14.859 --> 17:18.385
I don't know what news
you are referring to, Blair.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.821
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go check

17:19.908 --> 17:21.953
the reservations for dinner.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.391
Dorota, get it together.
We're leaving.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.436
If I'm just like
anyone else to her

17:26.523 --> 17:28.569
doubt she'll notice
I'm not at dinner.

17:28.656 --> 17:29.787
But it's your favorite holiday.

17:29.874 --> 17:30.832
Not anymore.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.531
Nate?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.055
Hey, Vanessa.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.795
I didn't expect
to see anyone here.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.754
I had some paperwork
to catch up on.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.235
I thought, it's Thanksgiving.
It'd be quiet.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.627
Why are you here?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.673
Oh, I borrowed this
pixies box set from Rufus.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.632
I, um, I was gonna return it.
I wrote a thank you note.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.461
If you could give it to him,
that'd be.. That'd be nice.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.073
Why didn't you take
it by the loft?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.944
Well, I think Dan likes me

17:56.031 --> 17:57.772
about as much as you do
right now, so...

17:57.859 --> 18:00.383
[dramatic music]

18:00.470 --> 18:03.299
Look, you and Chuck and Dan..

18:03.386 --> 18:06.128
I've somehow managed
to alienate everyone.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.394
If you could just
give Rufus the CDs

18:11.481 --> 18:13.962
and-and the thank you note,
I'd really appreciate that.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.181
Of course.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.486
And, Vanessa, listen. Uh..

18:18.053 --> 18:19.315
Take care of yourself.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.317
All right?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.411
My new boyfriend Aaron is on
his way here to meet everyone

18:28.498 --> 18:30.457
and I want your word
on something.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.764
If you're talking about
the dress, I say higher.

18:33.851 --> 18:37.072
Chuck, I want you word that
you will not mention anything

18:37.159 --> 18:38.769
about the girl I used to be.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
I just got Aaron to myself

18:40.597 --> 18:42.512
and if the one thing I have
to do to keep it that way

18:42.599 --> 18:44.514
is hide my recent
history for a while

18:44.601 --> 18:45.776
then that's what I'm gonna do.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.127
I get it. You lied to him.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.651
N-no, I didn't.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.350
I merely chose not to tell
him everything I ever did.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.483
And it will come out naturally

18:56.570 --> 18:58.833
over the course of the many
conversations we're gonna have

18:58.920 --> 19:00.530
as we're dating exclusively.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.793
You have my word,
whatever that's worth.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.449
Where are you going?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.799
Eric's waiting for me
in my father's study.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.540
We're having a business meeting.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.412
Oh.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
[gasps]
Oh, my God! You're here!

19:14.240 --> 19:15.197
Hey.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.633
Hey, that was so not

19:16.720 --> 19:17.982
on the same level as my hi.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.681
Uh, I bumped into Dan
at the store.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.292
Uh, he just said something.
I'm trying to figure it out.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.511
Figure what out?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.687
Something about a girl
named Georgina?

19:26.774 --> 19:27.688
[instrumental music]

19:27.775 --> 19:29.429
What?

19:29.516 --> 19:31.953
What-what's, um,
he even talking about?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.998
That's..

19:34.085 --> 19:36.523
Gosh. Um..

19:36.610 --> 19:40.440
Well, you know, he's-he's
probably just jealous.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.746
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
he was talking a lot about

19:42.833 --> 19:44.966
Thanksgiving last year when
you two were together, so..

19:45.053 --> 19:48.143
yeah. Well, I guess
he's just not as over me

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
as I thought he was.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.451
But-but seriously Aaron

19:51.538 --> 19:52.669
the next time he starts

19:52.756 --> 19:53.714
to tell you stories about me--

19:53.801 --> 19:55.063
No, no, no, no. Never again.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.195
No, it's not gonna happen again.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.298
What's going on?
Is something wrong?

20:12.385 --> 20:14.169
I've been grappling
with what to do all day

20:14.256 --> 20:17.433
what to say, which one of you
to talk to first.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.654
- Is Jenny okay?
- Yes, but you might not be.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.352
'I know it is Thanksgiving'

20:23.439 --> 20:25.311
but I think you should
get here right away.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.355
Lily?

20:26.442 --> 20:28.009
I will see you soon.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.580

20:47.158 --> 20:48.508
Can I help you?

I'd like to talk to you
about Nate Archibald.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.426
Are you going to open it?

- I'll tell you the combination.

every heist movie ever made.

Are those gold bars? I didn't
think they actually made those.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.639
this call was for me to make.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.293
I'm listening.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.425
The FBI just came to see me,
and Nate's in trouble.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.471
Tell someone who cares.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.647
Chuck, this is serious.
He needs our help.

Don't you dare answer

22:15.203 --> 22:17.248
But it's your mother,
and it's thanksgiving.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.164
And we have nothing
to be thankful for.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.079
This is the worst thanksgiving
of all time and if we have to

22:22.166 --> 22:23.690

side like outcasts in

22:23.777 --> 22:25.213

22:25.300 --> 22:27.737
Uh, maybe we can go
feed ducks at boat pond

22:27.824 --> 22:30.740
like when you were little.

22:30.827 --> 22:31.872
Fine.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.308
I'm not a monster.

your beautiful art collection?

about...something?

and I should talk in private

said what to whom

24:33.602 --> 24:35.517
and why they felt
compelled to say it?

to do that. She's right. I lied.

with me dating your ex

exactly have to.

and he doesn't.

I thought it was an emergency.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.104
Obviously I was wrong.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.802
It's more like an intervention.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.586
There's someone
you need to talk to.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.983
The FBI knows that
your dad's in town

25:50.070 --> 25:51.375
and they think he's
about to commit a crime.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.856
Even worse than
fraud or embezzlement.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.338
- Like what?
- Like extortion and kidnapping.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.124
When your father
escaped to Dominica

26:01.211 --> 26:02.473
he could only get his
hands on enough money

26:02.561 --> 26:04.214
to get himself set up.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.000
He should have found a job,
reinvented himself.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.046
But instead...he lived
the way he'd always lived.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.918
Now he's got nothing left.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.702
Yeah, well, if my father's poor,
what's the point of us

26:13.789 --> 26:16.400
going to live with him?
I mean, we don't have any money.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.141
But the Vanderbilts' do.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.274
Yeah, look, wh-why would
my grandparents pay us

26:20.361 --> 26:23.843
to go live with him when they
can't even help us out here?

26:23.930 --> 26:25.409
I mean, they hate my dad.

26:25.496 --> 26:28.195
Maybe that's why they
would give him money

26:28.282 --> 26:31.067
to leave without
you or your mom.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.417
'We've been monitoring
your father's calls.'

26:33.504 --> 26:35.681

with your grandparents.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.770
Oh, we-well, I mean,
if this is true

26:37.857 --> 26:40.076
why didn't you just come
tell me this yourself?

26:40.163 --> 26:42.992
We didn't know if you or your
mother knew what was going on.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.734
After all, she helped him
escape in the first place.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.606
But I told him I didn't
think that you would just

26:47.693 --> 26:48.868
leave New York.

26:48.955 --> 26:49.999
Especially without
saying goodbye

26:50.086 --> 26:51.435
to your friends.

of you talk it over.

This is just too much.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.320

that the captain can get away

27:06.407 --> 27:08.844
if that's what you want.

27:08.931 --> 27:12.456
But you could
also end it all...now.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.982
How?

27:16.069 --> 27:17.853
By turning your father in.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.336
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back, okay?

27:22.423 --> 27:24.643
A lot has been happening.
Agnes kicked me out.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.427
She burned all
my dresses and then

27:26.514 --> 27:28.908
I had to crash with Eric.
I had nowhere else to go.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.518
And I couldn't tell
anyone I was living here

27:30.605 --> 27:32.389
because then they'd tell you
and you'd be really mad.

27:32.476 --> 27:35.349
I'm not.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.394
I'm out of angry.
Miss you too much.

27:37.481 --> 27:40.223
Dad, please don't try to
guilt trip me right now, okay?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.399
Your brother helped me realize
that I haven't told you

27:42.486 --> 27:43.574
something-something important.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.272
What?

27:45.359 --> 27:46.752
I love you, Jenny.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.971
I love you so much.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.581
I'm willing to let you go,
if that's what

27:50.669 --> 27:53.062
it's gonna take
to get you back.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.369
And when the time comes
for a court hearing

27:55.456 --> 27:57.588
I won't stand in your way.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.589
But there's nothing you can do

27:58.677 --> 28:00.809
to make me stop loving you.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.729
I'm sorry.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.965
Dan and his father just
left to look for Jenny

28:26.052 --> 28:27.575
so maybe now would be
the perfect time for you

28:27.662 --> 28:29.229
to tell me what the hell's
been going on here today, Lily.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.361
You first.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.754
Where did you get those?

28:32.841 --> 28:35.061
It doesn't matter.
Did you read these?

28:35.148 --> 28:37.106
- Not yet.
- Only mine.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.194
None of you were supposed to--

28:38.281 --> 28:40.109
Find them..

28:40.196 --> 28:42.677
I can't believe this. You did
this to me and I dealt with it.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.766
But the kids? My kids?

28:44.853 --> 28:47.595
- Mom, you knew about this?
- We'll talk about that later.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.902
I'm just trying to protect them.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.947
'If you're gonna let
your son and daughter'

28:52.034 --> 28:53.862
'go where they please
and do as they please'

28:53.949 --> 28:55.168
someone has to
look out for them.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.691
'There's a difference between'

28:56.778 --> 28:58.040
looking out
for them and treating them

28:58.127 --> 29:00.739
like criminals in
their own home.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.263
How do you expect them to
trust us if we don't trust them?

29:05.439 --> 29:07.354
[sighs]
God. Okay, kids, let's go.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.750
Where are you going?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.752
Oh, well, this day
is about family

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
and if you're not for this
family then I'm gonna take

29:15.666 --> 29:17.625
mine and spend it with them.

29:20.715 --> 29:21.847
[door creaks]

29:27.287 --> 29:28.854
Where have you been?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.377
Your mother's almost done
packing. We have to go.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.031
Do you really think
your plan's gonna work?

29:32.118 --> 29:33.249
Well, it will if we hurry up.
Come on, let's go--

29:33.336 --> 29:34.947
No, I don't mean that.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.688
Are you really planning on
holding me and mom for ransom?

29:41.954 --> 29:44.478
Not all the money's for me,
Nate. It's for you guys, too.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.959
Look, this way, you and your mom
will get everything you deserve

29:47.046 --> 29:50.005
and I will have enough to
start over wherever I go next.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.311
Look, I want to take care of you

29:51.398 --> 29:53.052
but I-I don't know
what else to do.

29:53.139 --> 29:55.968
No, there's a different way
to get our lives back, dad.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.665
One that doesn't
require another felony.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.536
[scoffs]

29:59.623 --> 30:01.887
- The FBI are on the way here.
- Nate, please--

30:01.974 --> 30:03.366
Dad, listen.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.238
I love you.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.717
But if you can't
do the right thing

30:06.805 --> 30:08.371
then I can't respect you.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.636
So the choice is yours.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.160
You go out that
service entrance

30:14.247 --> 30:16.466
and you ruin our
relationship forever.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.774
Or you be a man

30:19.861 --> 30:22.081
and you turn yourself
in when they get here.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.171
- Well, that's not a choice.
- It is a choice.

30:25.258 --> 30:28.391
Because I'm sick of living in
the mess you've created for us.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.176
And I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

30:31.525 --> 30:34.397
And I hope you won't either.

30:34.484 --> 30:38.140
The annual Van Der Woodsen
Diner thanksgiving dinner, huh.

30:38.227 --> 30:40.229
We should have
a standing reservation.

30:40.316 --> 30:41.578
I think we do.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.319
What errand did
Serena have to run?

30:43.406 --> 30:45.060
I don't know

30:45.147 --> 30:46.888
but she took her file with her
and maybe she went to burn it.

30:46.975 --> 30:50.326
I don't blame her.
I should have burned mine.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.763
I lied before.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.591
I read it.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.684
Eric, whatever you read, um--

31:00.771 --> 31:02.469
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

31:02.556 --> 31:05.124
you were in
an institution like me.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.647
You were 19.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.214
You were just a few
years older than I was

31:08.301 --> 31:10.259
and after everything
I went through last year.

31:10.346 --> 31:11.826
Maybe I should
have said something

31:11.913 --> 31:14.524
but I wanted to
be strong for you.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.919
And plus, I really wasn't
ready to revisit it.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.878
I look forward
to talking about it

31:19.965 --> 31:21.967
when you're ready.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.969
It takes time. I should know.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.495
How did you get so wise?

31:28.582 --> 31:29.844
The nanny.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.193
[laughing]

31:35.110 --> 31:36.851
Okay.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.505
How about..

31:38.592 --> 31:40.637
...we have a real
thanksgiving dinner?

31:40.724 --> 31:42.204
It's not too late.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.684
What'd you have in mind?

31:43.771 --> 31:45.207
Well, come on.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.211
[elevator bell dings]

31:49.298 --> 31:51.692
- And..
- Oh, Serena.

31:51.779 --> 31:54.260
I-I was hoping
that you were...Blair.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.784
- Oh, why? Where is she?
- Maybe you can find out.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.351
- She's ignoring all our calls.
- Oh.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.135
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe she will take yours.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.789
- Would you mind?
- Yeah, of course.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.141
I'll let you know as soon
as I hear back from her.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.361
- Thank you.
- Is Aaron here?

32:08.448 --> 32:10.015
- He's over there.
- I think he's..

32:10.102 --> 32:11.930
- Thank you.
- Yes.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.279
Serena, hey.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.760
Dan didn't lie. I did.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.372
It was more of a lie
of omission, but still.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.722
[sighs]
I-I-I'm sorry.
I didn't tell you everything.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.420
I should have. Um, read this.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.813
If you still want
to be with me after

32:25.900 --> 32:27.597
then...let me know.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.472
[cell phone chimes]

32:34.561 --> 32:36.737
She's on 5th and 71st.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.043
Oh, thank you.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.174
Happy thanksgiving.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.828
Happy thanksgiving, dear.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.789
[sighs]

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
What are you doing?

32:51.273 --> 32:53.797
[sighing]

32:53.884 --> 32:56.017
My dad and I got in a fight

32:56.104 --> 32:59.020
I was crashing at Eric's,
and he finally chased me down.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.501
You're lucky.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.548
You have a family
who fights for you.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.376
Mine doesn't even
care if I'm there.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.509
Well, your mom loves you
in her own way, Blair.

33:09.596 --> 33:12.120
But the way
your father loves you

33:12.207 --> 33:14.079
I never had that.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.125
My own dad, as sweet as
he is, isn't here.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.084
Your father..

33:19.171 --> 33:21.738
...will go anywhere
for you...anytime.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.914
I know because..

33:24.002 --> 33:25.394
...I've sometimes
even made it happen.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.656
[chuckles]

33:31.574 --> 33:32.662
What?

33:35.230 --> 33:36.753
What? Is it my hair?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.364
No. You're just wrong.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.022
Jenny.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.806
You look cold.

33:45.893 --> 33:46.981
Here.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.159
Come home, dear.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.291
You've made your point.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.901
- I don't think I have.
- Hm-mm.

33:53.988 --> 33:56.469
Well, I think that you might
feel differently, when you

33:56.556 --> 34:00.212
find out what I have
been waiting...to show you.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.524
- I'll come.
- Yes.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.700
On one condition.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.441
Jenny has to go home, too.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.009
Well, I think
that's a terrific idea.

34:15.096 --> 34:18.882
Everyone should be where
they belong...on thanksgiving

34:18.969 --> 34:22.190
with their families.
Now.. Oh! Come on, come on.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.713
Come on, come on, come on.

34:23.800 --> 34:24.845
We'll drop you.

34:28.675 --> 34:29.893
What's going on?

34:44.691 --> 34:46.736
I love you both.

34:46.823 --> 34:49.043
I'm proud of you.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.566
[knock on door]

34:50.653 --> 34:53.047
No, don't.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.831
Let me.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.269
Howard, no.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.487
What's going on?

35:00.533 --> 35:03.013
- What are you doing, Howard?
- It's okay. He's gonna be okay.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.624
[man #1]
'You have the right
to remain silent.'

35:04.711 --> 35:06.539
'Anything you say can
and will be used against'

35:06.626 --> 35:08.236
'you in a court of law.'

35:08.323 --> 35:10.804
'You have the right to
have an attorney present..'

35:28.082 --> 35:30.606
Hey.
We were hoping you'd be here.

35:30.693 --> 35:34.001
[chuckles]
My mom's inside,
signing papers in the dark.

35:34.088 --> 35:37.178
We got our house back. Now, all
we need is some electricity.

35:37.265 --> 35:40.268
But look, I, um, I can't
thank you guys enough.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.926
I'm gonna give
you guys a moment.

35:48.972 --> 35:52.106
I...didn't want you to go.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.325
And I don't like to admit it

35:53.412 --> 35:54.413
but..

35:55.196 --> 35:56.328
...I still..

35:57.633 --> 35:58.678
Still?

36:00.462 --> 36:01.507
It's not important, umm.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.073
There's the whole
thing with Jenny

36:03.161 --> 36:04.684
and I don't want to
get in the way of that.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.947
Vanessa, I've, I haven't
heard from Jenny in weeks.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.775
So..

36:08.862 --> 36:11.081
...if you'd like, I mean, uh

36:11.169 --> 36:12.735
can we get together sometime?

36:15.999 --> 36:17.697
I guess that'd be okay.

36:19.525 --> 36:20.482
Cool.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.268
- Call me.
- I will.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.190
By the way

36:32.277 --> 36:33.800
I'm glad you stayed too.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.062
Thanks, man.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.456
No, let's, uh,
let's get drunk instead.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.284
[both laughing]

36:41.851 --> 36:43.375
[indistinct chattering]

36:51.426 --> 36:53.602
- Daddy.
- Oh, sweetheart.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.343
Oh! Oh, honey.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.476
Mwah! I would have come sooner.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.478
There was a TGV strike.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.393
Wait. This is the surprise?

37:01.480 --> 37:03.090
I thought you were
getting engaged.

37:03.177 --> 37:05.092
[guests murmuring]

37:05.179 --> 37:06.789
[chuckles]
Well.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.008
[laughing]
We are.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.490
I, I wanted your
father to meet Cyrus

37:11.577 --> 37:12.926
before we told everyone.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.624
'If...he didn't approve'

37:15.711 --> 37:19.585
of the man who might
become your...stepfather

37:19.672 --> 37:21.935
I couldn't quite
marry him, could I?

37:22.022 --> 37:23.545
[Cyrus laughs]

37:23.632 --> 37:26.026
'Well, now that the
cat's out of the bag'

37:26.113 --> 37:28.289
I-I think this calls
for a celebration.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.509
Mm-hmm. Dessert first,
I always say.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.818
Thank you, Dorota.

37:36.993 --> 37:38.168
'Are you hungry?'

37:40.606 --> 37:42.695
I guess I'm ready
for a new tradition.

37:44.566 --> 37:45.785
[door creaks]

37:48.701 --> 37:49.615
[keys clanking]

37:53.793 --> 37:54.968
I was kind of hoping
she'd be here.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.143
Yeah, I was too.

37:59.581 --> 38:00.843
Oh!

38:00.930 --> 38:01.975
You are.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.021
I love you too, dad.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.720
[chuckles]

38:07.807 --> 38:10.462
I don't, I don't want
to not be your daughter.

38:10.549 --> 38:11.724
[sighing]

38:17.077 --> 38:18.252
[scoffs]
Guys, I can't breathe.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.427
- Good.
- Good.

38:19.514 --> 38:20.863
[all chuckling]

38:35.748 --> 38:37.967
I don't need to read that.

38:38.054 --> 38:40.230
No, I-I think you do.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.846
Anything you want to tell
me you can tell me yourself.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.152
I want to know you.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.372
No matter what you've
done or how long ago.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.728
[Rufus laughing]

38:59.815 --> 39:01.556
[Lily]
'Is anyone home?'

39:01.643 --> 39:03.166
Hey! What are you doing here?

39:03.253 --> 39:04.951
[sighs]
I don't know.
It's thanksgiving.

39:05.038 --> 39:08.346
And I couldn't think of anywhere
that felt more like home.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.870
I'm glad to see that
you couldn't either.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.088
[both chuckles]

39:12.175 --> 39:13.568
E, call Serena.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.396
- I left a message already.
- Oh, good.
