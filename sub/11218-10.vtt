[theme music]

00:21.989 --> 00:24.758
[music continues]

00:31.499 --> 00:34.902
(male #1)
'I got your suspect. He's gonna
be on top of the tank.'

00:34.968 --> 00:37.338
'Okay, he's up and running.
Up and running Southbound.'

00:37.405 --> 00:39.573
'Units on the east side,
give me a perimeter.'

00:39.640 --> 00:41.642
'Start to get the perimeter.
Surround the tanks'

00:41.709 --> 00:44.445
'on every side and wait
for him to come down.'

00:44.512 --> 00:47.081
'He's pointing a gun at us.
He's shooting at us!'

00:47.148 --> 00:48.482
'We're taking rounds, partner.'

00:48.549 --> 00:51.352
'Alright, give me some altitude.
He's firing at us.'

00:51.419 --> 00:53.321
'Everyone alright?
Everyone good?'

00:53.387 --> 00:55.022
- Yeah.
- 'Alright.'

00:55.089 --> 00:58.292
Oh, shit. We got hit in
the fuel tank. I-I smell fuel.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.528
I'm thinking
we got hit in the fuel cell.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.696
I got gas on my foot.
Fuel's raining.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.499
(copilot)
'Patrol, officer needs help.
We're putting this thing in.'

01:05.566 --> 01:07.601
(male narrator)
Most cops managed
to stay sane

01:07.668 --> 01:10.003
despite the chaos
all around them.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.407
But in their hearts, they know,
everyone has a breaking point.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.811
(female #1)
'How's that new pillow
work for you?'

01:50.878 --> 01:52.813
Great. Slept like a rock.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.584
'Yeah? Hey, listen,
about the painters..'

01:56.650 --> 02:00.721
Oh, they can paint in there.
It's okay. I'm, uh..

02:02.323 --> 02:04.792
I'm gonna be moving back
home tomorrow.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.461
John. Look, you know
what Dr. Steward said.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.465
I think I know myself better
than the shrink. Alright?

02:11.532 --> 02:14.535
You've been amazing.
Above and beyond.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.374
But I'm ready to go it alone
and...you won't have to lock up

02:20.441 --> 02:22.042
the knives
in the kitchen anymore.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.944
Oh, come on.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.713
Look at me.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.318
It's okay.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.690
'Listen, have a good day, okay?'

02:36.757 --> 02:40.127
Go outside, go for a walk or
something. It's beautiful out.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.895
I will.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.163
You too.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.699
[door closed]

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
- He's right.
- There wasn't another reason.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.270
I just needed some
help. It's alright.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.172
Morning. Thought I'd
bring you a coffee.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.141
- Jesus. What're you doing?
- Oh.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.809
I'm Brooke,
by the way.

02:55.876 --> 02:59.112
The girl he stopped seeing
so he could just fuck you.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.548
What's your problem,
you psycho bitch?

03:00.614 --> 03:02.583
How did you know
where I live, huh?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.818
- I put an app on his phone.
- Come on.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.854
Don't be mad.
I did it for you.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.690
I came by so I can warn you.
Don't fuck..

03:09.757 --> 03:11.124
What the,
what the fuck!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.760
Hey! No, I came here for you.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.595
- Oh, for me?
- He's gonna fucking use--

03:14.662 --> 03:16.063
- Thanks a lot!
- Hey, come on.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.699
- Leave us alone, you crazy..
- Get rid of her.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.134
- Fuck alone!
- Fuck you!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.970
- Hey, hey!
- You got to let go.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.872
Just go.
Leave us alone!

03:24.938 --> 03:26.940
- Shit!
- Okay, alright.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.611
I hope you go have some
fucking demon babies.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.880
- Get some help.
- Go fucking die.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.181
- I'm fine.
- Go!

03:34.248 --> 03:36.149
Fuck you!

03:36.216 --> 03:38.419
He was fine when we
woke up this morning.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.889
If I had any idea he was sick,
I wouldn't have taken him out.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.559
(male #2)
'No, fresh air is good.
Did you take him to the park?'

03:45.626 --> 03:48.696
Um, no, the Cooper Lucero
crime scene.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.899
'I had to see for myself.'

03:51.965 --> 03:54.134
Maybe, for his birthday,
you could take him

03:54.201 --> 03:55.669
to the Dahmer house?

03:55.736 --> 03:58.572
Russ, I feel bad enough
as it is, okay?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.941
Alright, so you've
baby Motrin here on the side.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.244
Extra diapers in the bag,
wipes in the bag.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.747
Cool. Yeah, I got it.
I'll figure it out.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.917
- Are you sure?
- Go catch bad guys.

04:09.983 --> 04:13.687
Alright. I know you got it.
Thanks, Russ.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.022
See you later.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.124
(male #3)
'So, unfortunately,
nothing new.'

04:17.190 --> 04:18.792
'We got Phillip, Cody.'

04:18.859 --> 04:21.228
Those are still the first names
of the suspects

04:21.295 --> 04:23.063
that R.H.D. is working with.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.598
We got their truck.

04:24.665 --> 04:29.337
License number is
1-Edward-4-9-9-0-1.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.841
So, we're still on modified
TAC alert, us and Midtown bureau

04:33.907 --> 04:37.210
which means, you're gonna be
seeing brass and detectives

04:37.277 --> 04:40.147
in uniform until further notice.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.949
Now, um, R.H.D. wants you--

04:42.015 --> 04:45.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. That's it? After 18 days?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.655
You got to make this
an "us or them"?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.890
I mean, who? Seriously,
who's that gonna help, Dewey?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.725
'Sarge, come on, man.
This is bullshit.'

04:51.792 --> 04:54.595
Coop had to give up
his pin number to these pricks.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.230
You think they didn't go try
to get some money out?

04:57.297 --> 05:00.701
Where are the ATM photos?
Why is R.H.D. sitting on it?

05:00.768 --> 05:04.037
'I don't have an answer
for that, Dewey. I..'

05:05.238 --> 05:07.475
- Hey, John.
- 'Sarge.'

05:07.541 --> 05:09.710
I thought it was, uh,
your day off, no?

05:09.777 --> 05:13.313
It was. I guess Rabinkski needed
a break from humping the pine

05:13.381 --> 05:15.649
to detox, you know,
from all the stress.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.453
We swapped days.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.288
Okay, great.
That's good.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.824
Uh, have a seat.
We just, um..

05:25.192 --> 05:27.695
Yeah, we're just saying
we got, uh, just talking.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.797
We got new citation books,
so, make sure

05:29.863 --> 05:32.766
you trade your old ones in
at the kit room, alright?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.602
Some of you aren't
getting your supervisors

05:34.668 --> 05:37.070
'to sign your log
at the end of watch'

05:37.137 --> 05:38.606
'Take care of that.'

05:38.672 --> 05:41.509
Uh, that's it.
We got any questions?

05:41.575 --> 05:45.245
Alright, good.
Roll out and, uh..

05:45.312 --> 05:47.648
Yeah, roll out.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.558
So, this hippie lady,
Fran O'Brien

05:57.625 --> 06:01.361
she wasn't sure the guy she sold
her truck to was named Cody?

06:01.429 --> 06:03.531
Yeah, like it says
in our report.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.166
Well, uh, what gave you
that feeling?

06:06.233 --> 06:09.169
I mean, other than
her saying so?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.538
What you want?
A percentage?

06:10.604 --> 06:12.940
57, yeah.
No, 67.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.975
We're just trying
to get a sense here.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.110
Look, let's just
cut to the meat here.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.979
We know the suspects
had their wallets.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.249
They had to use their credit
cards or something at some time.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.751
Did you guys
get any hits?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.186
Nothing...credible at this time.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.456
'What? What?'

06:28.522 --> 06:29.957
What-what-what does
that even mean?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.593
Did you or did you not
get a hit, man?

06:32.660 --> 06:36.263
'It means that we're not
at liberty to say.'

06:36.329 --> 06:38.532
Okay.
How about DNA?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.568
We hear the suspects
cut their own hair.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.202
There had to be
clippings everywhere.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.704
Where'd you hear that?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.906
You gonna answer
her question with a question?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.641
This-this is us
sharing information?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.477
Listen, guys,
we're on the same team.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.311
We just don't want you
chasing ghosts.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.880
You ain't on my team.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.950
When our intel is credible we'll
pass it down to the divisions.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.952
We'll keep you apprised.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.489
(male #4)
'Next.'

07:01.555 --> 07:02.956
I talked to my buddy Matt.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.493
He's on the team
working my break-in.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.127
What'd he say?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.029
Well, he said
that Strokeface

07:09.096 --> 07:11.064
was actually at
a strip club that night.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.100
They got him on video.
Asshole wasn't lying.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.935
Doesn't mean
he didn't call it in.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.506
He could've gotten
one of his poo-butts to do it.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.108
When he was alive,
and I was gunning for him

07:21.174 --> 07:24.812
you try to cool me off, now he's
dead, you think he ordered it.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.447
Hey, I was trying to keep you
from doing something stupid.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.350
Considering he got shish-
kebabbed, maybe I had a point?

07:30.417 --> 07:31.885
[laughs]

07:31.952 --> 07:34.755
Matt also said that
there was a couple in their car

07:34.822 --> 07:36.223
making out that night.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.893
They saw a crappy green Civic
with a red hood

07:39.960 --> 07:42.730
burning rubber down the street
away from my house.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.398
We'll keep
our eyes peeled.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.800
We'll keep
our eyes peeled.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.736
I'm doing that ride-along
with the airship.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.003
Thanks for letting me know.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.672
Partners are supposed
to share shit.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.574
Come on.
It's a half a day.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.443
I thought you'd like
going all lone wolf.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.878
[door closed]

07:59.613 --> 08:02.716
Oh. It's like hay
and battery acid.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.718
Mine's great.
You just ordered wrong.

08:04.785 --> 08:08.656
What's with the health kick,
anyway, huh?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.324
Are you fucking
the gang detective?

08:11.391 --> 08:15.095
I just want to give her the
washboard abs she deserves, man.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.197
And trust me,
she's been earning them.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.832
[laughing]

08:18.899 --> 08:20.568
Ah!

08:24.805 --> 08:26.940
- No.
- There's no red hood.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.946
From Langer's, man.
Number 19.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.382
Beats those crap places
around here.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.985
I got lunch plans.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.853
Keep it anyway.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.096
They mean well,
okay? It's just..

08:49.162 --> 08:50.864
Well, it's
a tough situation.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.801
Past two and a half weeks,
I have had these book-smart

08:53.867 --> 08:56.970
street-stupid BSS
experts telling me

08:57.037 --> 09:00.373
how I'm supposed to feel
before I go back on the streets.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.410
And now I got this, what?
This peer counseling bullshit?

09:03.476 --> 09:06.714
Half the time these guys won't
even look me in the eye.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.883
The other times, it's "Hey,
Coop, how about a group hug?"

09:09.950 --> 09:13.353
"Hey, buddy, can we, uh,
help you wash your dick?"

09:13.420 --> 09:15.856
I'll get them
off your back.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.259
(Coop)
When do I
get to carry again?

09:19.326 --> 09:22.195
This rubber-gun squad
is like salt in the wound.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.899
I mean, come on. These nuts know
I've five guns at home, right?

09:25.966 --> 09:29.536
I can eat one there
just as easily as here.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.606
I'd keep that out of your
next therapy session, huh?

09:32.673 --> 09:37.177
Terry...I'm okay, alright?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.814
You know me.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.753
Just get me
back out there.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.988
It's above
my pay grade, John.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.159
You got them
to sign off on you.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.731
'I had a partner get killed.'

09:59.800 --> 10:01.935
You had a son.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.873
A son, and somehow,
you're not chained to your desk

10:05.939 --> 10:08.075
and your holster's not empty.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.412
My situation
is my situation.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.815
How I handled it
is my business.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.017
Yours is
out of my hands.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.921
We clear?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
Face the wall.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.563
Spread your legs.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.766
Just gonna see
your ink here.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.873
Hey, man, what the hell?
Open your hand.

10:39.940 --> 10:44.011
Oh, man, what the hell?
Ow! Man. What's up, man?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.846
- Did you break into my house?
- What?

10:45.913 --> 10:48.215
- 'Take this, scare my kid?'
- 'Hell no, man.'

10:48.281 --> 10:49.316
What you talking about?

10:49.382 --> 10:51.885
- Whoa!
- This is my stop and my guy.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.253
I didn't steal shit.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.488
This is my dad's ring
from the Rose Bowl.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.324
- This cocksucker stole it!
- Hey! Hold it!

10:57.390 --> 10:58.959
- Alright, alright.
- Motherfucker!

10:59.026 --> 11:00.327
- Alright, alright.
- Relax.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.129
- I bought that thing, man.
- 'Bullshit!'

11:02.195 --> 11:03.964
- No, man.
- 'Bullshit!'

11:04.031 --> 11:07.801
I bought it from some guy
at a club. He was selling shit.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.436
Who?
What is his name?

11:09.502 --> 11:12.105
I don't know. Man, somebody
called him Chris or something.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.341
No, his street name.
What's his fucking street name?

11:14.407 --> 11:17.778
- I don't know all that.
- This asshole's coming with us.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.347
I won't touch him.
Just bring him.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.816
[beeps]

11:27.988 --> 11:30.057
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.092
I'm sorry we couldn't
talk at the funeral.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.362
No, I understand.
I understand.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.767
I-I wanted you to know
I don't blame you for anything.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.402
I know you did
the best you could.

11:42.469 --> 11:47.040
I heard you and Hank,
the night before, went to a bar.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.376
A gay bar.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.847
- Is that true?
- Yes.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.517
So Hank was gay?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.887
He was pretty clear he wasn't.

11:59.953 --> 12:05.826
It would explain a lot
why we grew apart.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.197
How he was sometimes.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.268
So please, you don't have
to keep his secret.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.607
If you, if you were lovers,
just say it.

12:20.673 --> 12:24.344
No. No. We weren't.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.918
Asshole could
still be lying.

12:30.984 --> 12:34.087
Really?
With a 211 warrant on him?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.856
He had every reason
to spill.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.425
Plus, he did not flinch
when they asked him

12:38.491 --> 12:40.928
about the green-and-red Civic.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.797
Oh, and I got
the gang detectives

12:43.864 --> 12:46.266
running, uh, Chris
through their system

12:46.333 --> 12:48.068
every spelling,
even with a "Q."

12:48.135 --> 12:50.203
I wouldn't put it
past these fools.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.040
If anything jumps out at them
and they can't reach me

12:53.106 --> 12:56.509
while I'm in the air, I
told them to give you a call.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.046
No worries.
I got you.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.049
Keep a hard-on
for that car.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.986
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna find it, alright?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.388
- Alright.
- 'You got your sea-sick bands?'

13:08.455 --> 13:11.291
I don't need them.
Iron stomach.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.362
How's it going?

13:21.168 --> 13:24.972
When he called me with this, I
knew we'd get you guys involved.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.809
- Hey.
- Hey, Lydia, how you doing?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.879
- I'm good. You?
- I'm doing alright.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.480
What's up?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.086
- He's my partner, Chuck.
- It's cool.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.356
Alright. Look.
I got this piece of shit

13:43.423 --> 13:45.592
mid-level dope dealer
by the name of Jyreese.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.260
'He brings me a gun today.'

13:47.327 --> 13:49.496
'He got this gun
from a couple of tweakers'

13:49.562 --> 13:51.331
'he deals with
in exchange for dope.'

13:51.398 --> 13:53.934
Come on, man.
Let's just show her.

14:07.414 --> 14:12.085
- It's a Beretta 92FS.
- Police issue.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.922
'We ran the serial numbers.
That's Hank Lucero's gun.'

14:17.524 --> 14:21.194
If we bring this to R.H.D.
and they mess it up

14:21.261 --> 14:23.463
we'll never forgive ourselves.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.434
Grab up Jyreese.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.070
- 'Thank you.'
- 'Wrap that up. Let's roll.'

14:36.809 --> 14:38.511
- Huh?
- Stop!

14:38.578 --> 14:41.148
I wouldn't waste a bullet
on your ass, bitch.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.449
- Stop! Stop!
- Do this.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.318
- I didn't do shit!
- You lying bitch!

14:45.385 --> 14:48.788
Yeah. You know that gun
you gave? It's a cop's gun.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.357
- A dead cop's gun.
- 'No!'

14:50.423 --> 14:52.993
Like I told him,
I got it from this tweaker.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.762
- What's his name?
- I don't know! Let me go!

14:55.828 --> 14:58.999
Bear doesn't want this heat.
We'll just make you road kill.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.602
Stop! Look! They two
crazy-ass tweakers.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.837
They buy from me
all the time, okay?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.739
I'll take you to 'em.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.609
(male #5)
'You sure you want
to stick around Boyle Heights?'

15:09.676 --> 15:11.644
'I could take you up
to Stallone's house.'

15:11.711 --> 15:15.548
A pilot told me they got naked
women in the swimming pool.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.716
No, I'm good.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.551
'What'd you say
we're looking for again?'

15:18.618 --> 15:21.021
Crappy green Civic
with a red hood.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.589
'Alright.'

15:42.942 --> 15:45.212
[tires screeching]

15:50.984 --> 15:52.652
[tires screeching]

15:56.723 --> 16:00.627
Adam 36. I need
an OPG at my location.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.629
Got to impound a car.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.666
(woman on radio)
'836. Roger.'

16:06.733 --> 16:10.537
Glad you finally succumbed
to the allure of my pimp mobile.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.605
- Is that how you got Angela?
- Oh, yeah.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.008
Back seat,
whole lot of stories.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.383
(man on wireless)
'W30, we have a possible.'

16:23.450 --> 16:26.286
Here they go.
Here they go.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.892
I got two phones
and a GPS, dude.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.163
- Yo, no. Cash. I told you cash.
- I'm gonna bring you cash.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.530
Get back in the car!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.399
(Lydia)
'Go. Go, go,
go, go, go.'

16:39.466 --> 16:43.136
Williams 40, we're in pursuit
of a green Toyota Rav4

16:43.203 --> 16:44.671
no plate, headed
southwest on Repetto.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.740
- Get out of the car!
- Son of a bitch!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.279
'This is as fast
as this thing goes?'

16:52.345 --> 16:54.481
Yeah, we got it.
Here we go.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.917
[car revving]

16:57.984 --> 16:59.886
'Shoot.'

16:59.952 --> 17:02.355
Clear, clear,
clear, clear.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.058
[gunshot]

17:05.125 --> 17:07.194
- Oh!
- Shit!

17:11.131 --> 17:13.566
What's he doing?
What's he doing?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.703
Whoa! Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

17:16.769 --> 17:18.405
Whoa!

17:24.177 --> 17:26.246
Oh, damn.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.316
I used to kiss Barb.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.084
I almost
decked him once.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.120
He was a character.
Dig in. Come on.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.721
No, I'm-I'm
working the desk.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.056
I'm not really
that hungry.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.527
Well, I shouldn't be,
but...shit.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.796
Now that I'm off the sauce, I've
been eating like a racehorse.

17:45.031 --> 17:48.635
- You stopped drinking?
- Fuck, yeah.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.003
The night
you went missing.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.374
Wound up driving around all
night listening to the scanner.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.144
I even hooked up with
Danny Choi. You remember him?

17:57.210 --> 18:00.180
- Yeah.
- Fat, now. Shit.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.684
Anyway, he gave me a ride
to help out on the hunt

18:04.751 --> 18:08.455
and I vowed that if you were
found alive, I'd clean up.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.193
It's been 18 days. Shit.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.597
- I'm glad I could help out.
- Yeah.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.967
New lease on life, huh?
For both of us.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.769
[laughing]

18:22.835 --> 18:27.140
Yeah.
It's funny in a way.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.510
'So, you, uh,
you're all good now, huh?'

18:32.044 --> 18:34.214
'You always were
a tough son of a bitch.'

18:34.281 --> 18:36.616
'I'll take some credit
for that, thank you.'

18:36.683 --> 18:38.718
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.364
Listen,
I got to ask.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.700
Some of the boys
and I were talking.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.272
Why the hell
did you give up your guns?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.508
After that fucked up
thing back in the '60s

19:01.574 --> 19:03.576
and all the hoopla
there was about that..

19:03.643 --> 19:06.646
If I taught you anything, it's
you don't give up your guns.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.317
Come on, man.
Hey, I'm just talking here.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.520
There's no need to leave.
John. Johnny, come on.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.172
'Well, is, is that
one of them?'

19:33.240 --> 19:35.408
- Who said that?
- 'You did.'

19:35.475 --> 19:37.143
(Lydia)
'We're detectives too,
remember?'

19:37.210 --> 19:40.613
What I wanna know is how you
have a picture of the suspect.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.617
We had an ATM photo from when he
tried to use their bank cards.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.287
Wish we had it
before we rolled up on him.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.588
And what about patrol?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.823
You pull these guys over for a
busted taillight

19:50.890 --> 19:53.059
and not know that they
have cop killers?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.361
Hey, you got a problem

19:54.427 --> 19:55.795
take it up
with Captain Mullen.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.630
Meantime,
you mind telling me

19:57.697 --> 20:01.534
how, uh, major asshole winds up
hamburgered in your suspension?

20:01.601 --> 20:04.070
Uh, we got
a few anonymous tips.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.572
'Uh,
the first one..'

20:05.638 --> 20:07.940
...that there's a tweaker
who fit the description.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.010
He liked to cop his dope
in an alley off of Repetto.

20:11.077 --> 20:15.882
We found him, tried to talk
to him, and, well, he bolted.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.518
And the second one
was that a dead cop's gun

20:18.585 --> 20:21.454
can be found in a dumpster
on 4th and Central.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.156
We called our buddy Chuck Munoz.
He works vice there.

20:24.223 --> 20:28.828
'He's got a black-and-white
that's holding that down now.'

20:28.895 --> 20:31.130
Yeah, well, the moment
those tips came in

20:31.197 --> 20:32.765
you should have
let us know.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.000
Well, why?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.768
We're on the same team,
aren't we?

20:35.835 --> 20:38.405
The last thing we'd want
is you wasting your time

20:38.471 --> 20:39.972
chasing ghosts.

20:40.039 --> 20:44.076
So, when we have information
that's credible, of course

20:44.143 --> 20:45.712
we'll keep you apprised.

20:45.778 --> 20:50.417
- Yeah, that's, uh, teamwork.
- Makes your dream work.

20:53.920 --> 20:58.891
- Thanks for running him over.
- It wasn't exactly my intent.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.660
And losing
that other guy.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.829
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.065
'Look, John, I am clashing
with R.H.D. on this'

21:06.132 --> 21:08.234
so I'm taking my own tack.

21:08.301 --> 21:11.704
But if you don't want to talk
about this, I totally get it.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.873
I don't know
what I can say.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.343
'I told them
all I could remember.'

21:18.210 --> 21:19.812
I want to do
something else.

21:19.879 --> 21:23.650
It's gonna
feel weird, but..

21:23.716 --> 21:27.987
...I wanna see if you can see
this from another perspective.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.122
Can you imagine
you're a video camera

21:30.189 --> 21:32.459
looking down on yourself?

21:32.525 --> 21:35.362
The house,
everything that happened?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.868
'Don't be in it,
be above it.'

21:41.934 --> 21:44.871
'And then, tell me
if you can see anything new.'

21:46.639 --> 21:49.809
No, I don't, I don't, uh..

21:49.876 --> 21:51.744
I don't see shit.

21:51.811 --> 21:56.616
- Okay. I appreciate you trying.
- Thank you.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.657
- Thank you.
- Stay strong, John.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.826
And we'll be
in touch.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.833
(John)
'Sul-sulfur.'

22:15.267 --> 22:19.739
- What?
- 'The guys' clothes.'

22:19.806 --> 22:24.143
They smelled like sulfur,
like rotten eggs.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.947
When they got close,
their skin, clothes..

22:31.818 --> 22:33.486
...sulfur.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.724
Okay.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.767
[whistling]

22:47.834 --> 22:51.438
I told you to get rid of that
shit you stole, but did you?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.872
I don't know
what you talking.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.774
Don't lie to me again,
stupid fuck.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.308
You're leaving town tonight.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.577
What?
Fuck that.

22:57.644 --> 23:00.012
That's your fix
to get the cops off my back?

23:00.079 --> 23:02.915
It's not about the other house
you robbed, genius.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.185
Who do you think I am?
I can't make shit go away.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.254
So, I stick
my neck out for you

23:08.320 --> 23:10.289
and now you can't
return the favor.

23:10.356 --> 23:13.926
If I get grabbed, I'm gonna let
'em know you're a dirty-ass cop.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.530
Is that a threat? Huh?
Are you threatening me?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.331
'Cause you
go right ahead.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.401
They'll put me on a desk,
there will be an investigation

23:22.469 --> 23:24.036
and we'll see
who lasts longer.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.237
What does that mean?

23:25.304 --> 23:27.874
What are the NBK's
gonna do when I tell them

23:27.940 --> 23:29.909
that you tried
to pin it on them?

23:29.976 --> 23:34.346
- You wouldn't do that.
- Oh, I would. And I will.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.315
You're done, Moco.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.950
- You're done.
- But I can't leave.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.887
They stole my car.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.359
You breathe a word of this
to your sister..

23:47.426 --> 23:50.497
...and I will
personally bury you.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.071
(male on speaker)
'Attention, all units.'

23:59.138 --> 24:00.973
'This is

Cody.

making matches, bombs.

Why do you know
that information?

25:48.247 --> 25:49.415
- Why?
- I read books.

We've a 187 suspect
contained in the tank yard.

27:02.154 --> 27:05.892
We need an airship.
Get S.W.A.T. rolling.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.028
So, these tanks, they go on
for acres, alright?

27:09.095 --> 27:11.664
We'll wait for airship
to get here to get eyes.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.833
He's on top
of one of those things.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.467
He's a sitting duck
up there.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.769
Yeah, not so fast, okay?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.404
We're not gonna rush
in there.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.638
If he's got
Cooper's gun

27:19.706 --> 27:21.674
it's still got 14 rounds
in the mag.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.542
Yeah, he wasn't suggesting

27:23.609 --> 27:25.644
that we get picked off
one by one.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.079
'What the hell's wrong
with you?'

27:27.146 --> 27:28.514
- With me?
- Yeah, you.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.716
What's wrong with you?

27:29.782 --> 27:31.150
This is the second time today

27:31.217 --> 27:33.385
that you've kept major intel
from R.H.D.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.621
I got to wonder about
you guys' priorities, huh?

27:35.688 --> 27:38.691
You wanna get these assholes
or yourself in the headlines?

27:38.758 --> 27:41.093
Oh, wow.
You're accusing us of that?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.862
After not sharing
a single lead?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.096
- Are you kidding?
- What's wrong?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.531
What's wrong with you,
huh?

27:45.597 --> 27:46.966
Mommy got you
on a leash?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.234
'Yo, what's wrong with you?'

27:48.300 --> 27:50.602
Are you ignoring me?
I'm standing right here.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.504
I will knock you
the out, man.

27:52.571 --> 27:53.840
You're an idiot.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.674
You are not anything,
you understand me?

27:55.742 --> 27:57.710
- I can barely hear you.
- Break it up.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.679
Wait. W-w-what's wrong?

28:00.747 --> 28:02.715
Where are you going?

28:02.782 --> 28:04.650
Oh, my God. Alright.
I-I'll be there.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.085
- I gotta go.
- What's going on?

28:06.152 --> 28:07.720
- I gotta go.
- You want me?

28:07.787 --> 28:10.156
No. You stay here
and get this guy.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.261
'I got your suspect.'

28:15.327 --> 28:17.296
He's gonna be
on top of the tanks.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.032
'On top of the tanks,
hiding behind a utility box.'

28:20.099 --> 28:22.268
'He's up and running.
He's up and running southbound.'

'Units on the east side,
give me a perimeter.'

28:24.904 --> 28:27.073
'Start to get the perimeter.
Surround the tanks.'

28:27.139 --> 28:29.308
'The tanks are right in front.
Let's surround those.'

28:29.375 --> 28:31.010
'Let's get everybody
on every side'

28:31.077 --> 28:33.145
'and wait for him
to come down.'

28:33.212 --> 28:35.181
'He's pointing a gun
at us. He's shooting.'

28:35.247 --> 28:37.016
'We're taking rounds, partner.
We're taking rounds.'

28:37.083 --> 28:38.417
'Give me some altitude.'

28:38.484 --> 28:40.152
'He's firing at us.'

28:40.219 --> 28:42.054
Everyone alright?
Everyone good?

28:42.121 --> 28:44.123
- Yeah.
- 'Alright.'

28:44.190 --> 28:46.225
'We got hit in the fuel tank.'

28:46.292 --> 28:49.328
'I-I smell fuel.
We got hit in the fuel cell.'

- 'Okay.'
- 'Just hang on, Sammy.'

28:54.901 --> 28:56.969
'We're gonna be alright.
We're gonna be alright.'

Make it a health call.'

We're putting this thing in.'

'I got a lot of wires
over here, partner.'

'Fuel cell has been shot. We are
going in at our location.'

'We need a unit quickly.'

29:31.203 --> 29:34.006
'Need to find a place to land.'

29:36.142 --> 29:37.910
Tell-tell me,
tell me he's okay.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.112
Oh, he's great.
It's okay. Yeah.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.747
He's just getting
his diaper changed.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.149
- He's fine.
- What happened?

29:43.215 --> 29:46.218
Uh, he had
a febrile seizure.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.454
- What's that?
- It sounds worse than it is.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.490
The doc said that it's common
when a baby's fever spikes.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.960
You know what?
He stiffened up a little bit.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.195
His eyes started to flutter,
I raced him here.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.230
He was done
by the time we reached.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.866
- Oh, my God.
- Look at him.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.301
He's great.
And his temperature's normal.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.904
He's teflon,
like his mama.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.438
Right?
Yeah.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.241
Hey. Hey.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.411
Hey.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.414
Oh, save me some.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.216
Don't worry.

30:17.283 --> 30:20.252
There wasn't much left
to begin with.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.988
Here.

30:24.957 --> 30:29.395
Hey, hey.
I saw on the news.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.164
God, John.

30:33.365 --> 30:37.870
You still haven't given me
an answer..

30:37.937 --> 30:40.139
...about the baby.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.309
I had time
to think about it.

30:43.375 --> 30:49.848
Now, the more I do,
the more sense it makes to me.

30:49.916 --> 30:53.585
I mean, the two of us.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.287
Parents?

30:56.989 --> 30:59.959
- Come on, that's a home run.
- I know.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.160
Look, I just..

31:01.227 --> 31:02.594
Now is not a good time

31:02.661 --> 31:04.830
for us to be making decisions
like this.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.999
No, no, no.
Now is exactly the time.

31:07.066 --> 31:12.171
I see things...clearly,
like-like I never have.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.109
What do you say?

31:18.444 --> 31:23.649
Is it the whole funky-family
thing that's bugging you?

31:23.715 --> 31:27.954
'Cause, I mean, we could
even consider living together.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.388
- I mean, why not?
- John, John.

31:29.455 --> 31:32.324
- We could make this work.
- Hey.

31:32.391 --> 31:36.828
I don't want
to have a baby.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.399
Not with you.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.668
Not anymore.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.073
I'm so sorry.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.318
All I could think about

31:59.385 --> 32:01.353
all I could see was Nate,
you know?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.990
Who would tell him,
or-or how he would act

32:04.056 --> 32:06.458
or if he'd even remember me
when he was three.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.828
That, I'm telling you,
that was the scariest part.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.464
Him not knowing me,
you know?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.200
Hey.
I'm sorry. Baby.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.103
- It's Moco.
- Okay. Alright.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.537
- I think he's in trouble.
- Look.

32:18.604 --> 32:23.309
- Let's let Sammy rest, alright?
- 'I'm sorry. Baby.'

32:23.375 --> 32:24.943
- What's wrong?
- He left L.A.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.878
He left L.A.
Something's wrong.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.314
Maybe he's just
sleeping one off.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.615
No, no.
He called me.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.051
He said
he-he's moving to Atlanta

32:32.118 --> 32:34.186
that he got some job
or some shit.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.088
- Shh. Calm-calm down.
- Chris, a job.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.923
Okay, okay, okay.
Alright. Calm down.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.158
- Okay. Okay.
- Alright?

32:39.225 --> 32:40.792
- Okay, I'm gonna fix it.
- Okay.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.695
Okay? Alright.
Come on.

the outside agencies

32:57.043 --> 32:58.577
who participated
in this manhunt.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.479
But I want to give
special credit

33:00.546 --> 33:03.849
to the detectives that brought
this case to a close.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.885
As all of you know,

33:06.952 --> 33:08.954
is our most elite
detective unit.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.389

the divisional detectives.

a little bit about it.

to thank me.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.490
- Nice.
- Yeah.

33:44.556 --> 33:48.160
Hopefully that will get him
some peace, you know?

33:48.227 --> 33:49.628
What are you doing here,
anyway?

33:49.695 --> 33:52.398
You gonna let R.H.D.
get all the glory?

Trust me.
Ruben is up there on that dais

for both of us.

he is way in the back.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.612
You think
he's warm enough?

Are you kidding?

34:07.979 --> 34:11.250
You got him wrapped up here

34:11.317 --> 34:13.685
You know the Michelin man
is white?

made out of tires

34:16.355 --> 34:18.090

You ever
think about that?

35:38.704 --> 35:42.641
You know, after you left,
I started thinking.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.745
If I were an asshole
who robbed a cop

35:46.812 --> 35:50.349
I thought maybe somebody
saw my car, what would I do?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.850
I'd probably ditch it,
right?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.185
Maybe set it on fire.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.020
'So, uh, I called around,
you know'

35:55.086 --> 35:56.722
'to the
various police garages'

35:56.788 --> 36:00.125
'and I ask them,
have you towed a Civic'

36:00.192 --> 36:01.860
'with a red hood recently?'

36:01.927 --> 36:03.462
And guess what?

36:05.030 --> 36:10.469
Fucking today, in our division,
they impounded a car

36:10.536 --> 36:12.504
that matches that description.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.342
'They even faxed me
a report.'

36:16.408 --> 36:18.310
And get this..

36:18.377 --> 36:21.112
...the car is registered
to a Cris D. Herrera.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.249
This mother fucker.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.083
I run, I run his name

36:25.150 --> 36:30.121
and he is a half a gangster
with the street name Moco.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.724
Moco.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.727
That's the street name
of my..

36:35.794 --> 36:39.130
...of my partner's
girlfriend's brother.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.934
Ain't that right?
Fuck man.

36:46.605 --> 36:50.409
So many lies, Ben, and-and you
fucking almost had me

36:50.476 --> 36:54.145
all the way up until the end,
but in the final hour

36:54.212 --> 36:55.614
you used
your own badge number.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.649
I wonder,
now, why would he do that?

36:57.716 --> 37:02.254
Just inexperience, maybe ego,
or perhaps that's just

37:02.321 --> 37:04.890
what happens when he panics.

37:09.495 --> 37:12.531
- You think I broke the code?
- Yes.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.002
No.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.604
You broke it first.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.374
I stuck my neck out.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.975
No questions asked.

37:24.042 --> 37:27.646
And I lied to I.A. when you
beat the shit out of Tammi.

37:27.713 --> 37:33.785
I backed you man, 100%,
said there was no fucking tape.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.121
And then,
when you can't shake the guilt

37:36.187 --> 37:39.157
can't live with yourself,
like some goddamn altar boy

37:39.224 --> 37:42.160
I'm supposed
to let that happen?

37:42.227 --> 37:44.730
No.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.898
No.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.836
I did
what I had to do.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.639
What any sane person
would do.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.974
I did it to save your life.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.309
That's shit.
You know it.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.811
You did it for you,
like you always do.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.780
I have saved your ass
many times.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.483
You saved my ass?
You, that's your fucking job.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.717
You want a pat?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.753
And by the way,
you saved my life

38:07.819 --> 38:09.955
after you put my life
in danger.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.824
After you put my son's life
in danger.

38:12.891 --> 38:13.959
So, you want a pat?

38:14.025 --> 38:15.894
Maybe, I'll give
Chief Beck a call

38:15.961 --> 38:19.431
and he can give you another
hero's award, Officer Sherman.

38:19.498 --> 38:23.335
You fucking poster boy.
Is that what you want?

38:24.836 --> 38:25.771
Fuck you.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.640
Fuck me.
You piece of shit.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.515
Get off me.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.096
We were partners!

38:51.162 --> 38:52.998
We were partners!

38:55.200 --> 38:56.435
Were.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.004
That's right. Were.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.972
Piece of shit.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.832
'You're right.'

39:26.898 --> 39:30.669
'I did come back to patrol
to try and make a difference.'

39:30.736 --> 39:34.172
To help cops avoid
some of the mistakes I made.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.107
Hell..

39:36.174 --> 39:39.945
Some of the mistakes
I continue to make.

39:40.011 --> 39:44.850
But all I can do is show them
by how I act out there

39:44.916 --> 39:49.888
to hold on to who I am,
and see if anybody cares.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.894
'I won't help everyone.'

39:55.961 --> 40:00.599
I couldn't possibly.
I-I can see that now.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.902
But I don't really have to,
you know?

40:07.439 --> 40:10.776
That's not all it is for me.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.083
[engine rumbling]

40:55.654 --> 40:57.222
What the hell
are you doing?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.857
Get off my damn property.

40:58.924 --> 41:02.628
'I told you if I come back,
we were gonna have a problem.'

41:02.694 --> 41:04.229
Leave it off.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.231
I'm gonna bust your ass
for this.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.666
You want to go to jail?

41:07.733 --> 41:09.535
You're that cop.
My brother told me.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.769
He didn't tell you enough.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.203
'We're not growing pot,
idiot.'

41:12.270 --> 41:14.640
'They shut our power,
'cause we missed two payments.'

41:14.706 --> 41:17.275
'We're running that to cook
and keep our lights on.'

41:17.342 --> 41:18.510
Is that a crime now?

41:18.577 --> 41:19.911
Yeah.
It's a noise violation.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.412
You're keeping
my wife up.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.081
Tell her
to shut her windows.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.251
'Shut up out there!'

41:28.086 --> 41:30.922
- 'Fucking pig.'
- What did you just say?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.290
You heard me.

41:32.357 --> 41:36.227
'Being a cop doesn't make you
any less of an asshole.'

41:57.282 --> 41:59.651
[police siren blaring]

42:02.721 --> 42:05.323
Police! Let me
see your hands!

42:05.390 --> 42:07.458
Let me see
your hands!

42:07.525 --> 42:09.628
'Stop!'

42:09.695 --> 42:12.130
'Turn around slowly.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.069
[helicopter hovering]

42:26.211 --> 42:28.013
'Let me see your hands.'

42:30.515 --> 42:33.251
[gun firing]

42:41.693 --> 42:43.228
Clear that gun.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.163
'Weapon secure.'

42:46.531 --> 42:49.167
Alright, hey,
let's get an R.A.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.938
'Hey, this guy's a cop.
This is John Cooper.'

42:53.004 --> 42:54.572
'Get an R.A.
Hurry up.'

42:54.640 --> 42:57.308
'Come on, man,
stay with me. Come on.'

42:57.375 --> 43:00.278
'Come on. Stay with me.'

43:04.049 --> 43:06.752
'Keep breathing.
Come on, buddy.'

43:06.818 --> 43:09.587
[helicopter hovering]

43:25.671 --> 43:28.674
[theme music]
