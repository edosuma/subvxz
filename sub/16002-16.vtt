Yes, I do.

- Exactly.
- I think we're not having sex

06:42.417 --> 06:44.250
You know what I think?

You didn't ask Deena
because she'd say not
to have sex with the nanny.

It'd be messy, weird
and inappropriate.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.750
Marshmallows. Pretty cool, huh?

12:33.333 --> 12:35.959
- You want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

12:35.959 --> 12:38.875
Could it possibly be symbolic
that you're firing off

12:38.875 --> 12:40.834
white pellets all over the room?

12:40.834 --> 12:43.709
On the one hand,
this vow of celibacy thing,

12:43.709 --> 12:46.458
best move I've ever made.
I'm going gangbusters.

12:46.458 --> 12:49.333
I feel like I'm back on the
fast track here, I really do.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.667
So, what's the problem?

12:50.667 --> 12:54.041
I'm a mess. I'm getting
propositioned like never before.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.333
And I just met with Natasha Drew
for the KC Gaming account.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.417
Look at you go.
That's great...

12:59.417 --> 13:02.458
No, it's terrible! I couldn't
hear anything she was saying

13:02.458 --> 13:06.417
because I couldn't stop
staring at her breasts,
which she was OK with.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.792
[growls]

13:10.041 --> 13:11.125
- Ben.
- [man] Yes, sir?

13:11.125 --> 13:12.667
I'm out of ammo.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.000
I'm about to burst.
I'm barely hanging on.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.792
If she becomes my client...

13:16.792 --> 13:19.834
I'm sorry, sir. I've been
ordered to cut you off.

13:19.834 --> 13:23.792
- What are you talking about?
- The cleaning crew
filed a complaint.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.291
[laughs] You gummed up
one of the vacuum cleaners?

13:26.291 --> 13:29.166
Peter Green wants to see you
when you have a minute.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.458
Right.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.709
See?

13:33.709 --> 13:37.959
- Whoa...
- Right.

13:38.917 --> 13:40.583
You wanted to see me, sir?

13:40.583 --> 13:43.875
Hillman, I've heard
some troubling rumors about you.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.041
Please tell me they're not true.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.500
If this is about
the vacuum cleaner, I...

13:48.500 --> 13:54.333
Did I hear something about
you taking a vow of celibacy?

13:54.333 --> 13:55.959
Uh, yes.

13:55.959 --> 14:01.250
I made a vow not to have
sex until I made partner.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.500
Well,
you're a partner now.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.500
I'm sorry. Did you
just say I'm a partner?

14:06.500 --> 14:10.417
I can't have somebody
on my team that's distracted.
Congratulations.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.709
You have no idea
how long I've wanted
to hear this.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.250
[laughs]

14:16.250 --> 14:19.709
- You're not planning
on kissing me?
- No, sir.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.917
Good. Sit down. Listen,

14:22.917 --> 14:26.625
there is no more perilous time
in a man's life

14:26.625 --> 14:29.834
than the moment after
he has accomplished a goal.

14:29.834 --> 14:33.750
It is critical that he
replace the previous goal

14:33.750 --> 14:38.417
with a new goal, right away.
You understand, Hillman?

14:38.417 --> 14:42.417
Yes. You want me to keep up
the effort until my name's
on that front door.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.917
Tomorrow, yes, I do.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.750
But tonight,
I want you to get laid.

14:57.917 --> 15:02.875
- What time is it?
- 7:15.

15:02.875 --> 15:05.917
That only took us
15 minutes?

15:05.917 --> 15:09.917
Well, we know each other now.
Maybe we're just good at it.

15:12.917 --> 15:16.083
- So do you feel more connected?
- Sure.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.458
You want to go
to Tiki Thai for dinner?

15:20.458 --> 15:23.250
You know I hate Tiki Thai.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.250
- I don't know
why I'm so nervous.
- I know.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.083
Not like flirting
on the phone?

15:29.083 --> 15:31.417
There are things
we can talk about though.

15:31.417 --> 15:35.291
For example, Geneva's teacher
called me today and...

15:35.291 --> 15:38.000
I thought maybe we
wouldn't talk about the kids.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.458
In fact, I was thinking
we could pretend like we
don't even have children.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.125
OK. [laughs]

15:47.458 --> 15:50.000
- What do we talk about?
- I have no idea.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.625
What do people talk about
on their first date?

15:53.625 --> 15:57.250
Uh, we could talk about
where you went to college.

15:57.250 --> 16:01.250
- You know where I went.
- Deena, there's
got to be something.

16:01.250 --> 16:06.333
- There was this guy...
- Mm. This should be good.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.458
- It was a long time ago.
- Mm-hm.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.792
It was in college.

16:11.792 --> 16:16.500
He was at the student union
and he was looking for a book

16:16.500 --> 16:18.458
to buy for one
of his classes.

16:18.458 --> 16:21.500
And, uh,
he couldn't afford a new one.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.291
And, uh,
there wasn't a used one,

16:24.291 --> 16:28.792
so he was just sort of standing
there and counting his change.

16:28.792 --> 16:32.834
I thought he
was kind of cute,

16:32.834 --> 16:38.166
so I, uh, secretly put my
used copy that I was gonna buy

16:38.166 --> 16:40.542
back on the shelf
when he wasn't looking.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.458
And I waited to see
if he would find it.

16:43.458 --> 16:46.250
And he did.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.709
And he was really happy.

16:48.709 --> 16:54.250
I used to hang out after that
class. Sort of hover, you know?

16:54.250 --> 16:57.333
And pretend I was walking
in the same direction as him

16:57.333 --> 17:01.709
until he finally,
finally said hello.

17:04.709 --> 17:07.166
Which took you forever,
by the way.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.750
You never told me
that story before.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.875
I haven't thought about it
in a long time.

17:15.875 --> 17:21.709
Well, now I feel bad
'cause I totally could have

17:21.709 --> 17:25.375
bought the book new. I was
just saving my money for beer.

17:25.375 --> 17:29.583
Uh-huh. That's good to know
because you owe me $9.

17:29.583 --> 17:33.417
You are so barking up the
wrong tree because I'm broke.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.291
[laughs] I know.

17:36.542 --> 17:40.417
- [knocking]
- You are my wingman tonight.

17:40.417 --> 17:43.458
- What are you talking about?
- I made partner, partner!

17:43.458 --> 17:45.917
Oh, my God!
It's about time, slacker!

17:45.917 --> 17:48.792
I know, huh?
So tonight, I'm giving myself

17:48.792 --> 17:53.250
license to have wanton,
reckless sex with the
first woman who says yes.

17:53.250 --> 17:57.583
- Adam made partner.
- Oh, my God! Oh!

17:57.583 --> 17:58.959
Congratulations!

17:58.959 --> 18:01.250
- Easy there now, partner.
- Sorry.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.542
We were just
heading out for dinner.

18:03.542 --> 18:07.875
Great! You can come too.
A woman's touch.
Make me look less desperate.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.875
- I don't know about that.
- You two figure out
where we're gonna go eat,

18:10.875 --> 18:13.792
and I'll be right back.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.500
- Where we're gonna eat?
- This is a big deal for him.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.458
I feel like I'm living
in a dorm room.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.959
This is so
not a dorm room!

18:19.959 --> 18:23.333
Hey! Is this how
you pictured it?

18:26.500 --> 18:29.917
- I could wear a shorter skirt.
- Is that even possible?

18:29.917 --> 18:32.500
She's helping
with the Berry Town
presentation.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.291
- Hello. Stephanie, right?
- Yep.

18:35.291 --> 18:38.333
I'm Adam. You remember me?

18:38.333 --> 18:39.750
Stephanie is fantastic.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.625
- Quick! Give me the 4-1-1.
- Who are you? Coolio?

18:44.625 --> 18:48.000
Just tell me about her. Does
she like movies? Sports? Music?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.542
OK. She's from the Midwest.
Her dad's a doctor.

18:50.542 --> 18:53.500
She likes French films,
or fries... Oh! Volleyball!

18:53.500 --> 18:57.000
I think she was on
her high school volleyball team.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.959
- How do you know
so much about her?
- I don't.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.458
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.750
Toast.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.125
Wha...? Oh! Right.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.667
Um, how about a toast
to Adam's good news.

19:12.667 --> 19:15.208
- What good news?
- Adam made partner today!

19:15.208 --> 19:18.500
Oh, please.
It's not that big of a deal.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.875
I mean, who wants to hear
about my boring job.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.625
It's people's hobbies
that make them interesting.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.583
- Yeah.
- You know what
I like to do to relax?

19:27.583 --> 19:32.208
- I love to play
a little beach volleyball.
- Oh, God.

19:32.208 --> 19:35.542
There's nothing like
that feeling of sand
between your toes

19:35.542 --> 19:39.667
and the leather
against your hands.
I mean, you know what I mean.

19:41.125 --> 19:44.375
And that volleyball
in Cast Away? Wilson.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.458
That thing should've
won the Oscar.

19:50.959 --> 19:53.208
Can I get some more
champagne please?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.542
[Deena] Good night. Thanks.

19:59.875 --> 20:02.709
Wow. Didn't think
she'd ever leave.

20:02.709 --> 20:05.542
I guess we could've worked
this part out better.

20:05.542 --> 20:08.917
You know,
the whole logistics part.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.583
I wanted to give you
a good-night kiss

20:11.583 --> 20:15.291
at your front door, but...

20:15.291 --> 20:19.917
I guess the staircase
could be the front door.

20:19.917 --> 20:24.083
Come on, my lady.
Follow me across these puddles,
if you don't mind.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.709
[Deena laughs]

20:26.709 --> 20:30.500
Thank you for
walking me to my front door.

20:30.500 --> 20:34.542
- I had a really
good time tonight.
- Me too.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.500
[baby cries]

20:39.500 --> 20:42.500
Can't be our children because
we don't have children yet.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.917
- I know!
- So who are they?

20:43.917 --> 20:46.834
I have no idea, but maybe
we should check on them.

20:46.834 --> 20:51.083
Make sure they're
tucked in so there won't
be any more interruptions.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.375
That's a good idea.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.625
- I'll race you.
- OK.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.458
Hey, sweetie. Dave, come here
and feel her forehead.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.959
Is she as hot as I think she is?

21:10.792 --> 21:12.417
What do you think
we should do?

21:13.959 --> 21:17.709
Oh, honey. She's burning up.
She needs to go to the hospital.

21:23.417 --> 21:26.500
OK. Well, at least we know
what's causing the fever.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.667
- Your daughter
has an inner ear...
- Infection. I knew it.

21:29.667 --> 21:33.667
- I take it she had her implant
surgery done recently?
- About four weeks ago.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.125
- So it's not working?
- Not as far as I can tell.

21:36.125 --> 21:37.834
[PA] Dr. Pachefsky,
multiple GSW.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.834
- But our doctor...
- Look, honestly.

21:39.834 --> 21:43.333
I'm not an expert, but right
now, your daughter cannot hear

21:43.333 --> 21:46.792
- anything in that ear at all.
- Got to move. GSW.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.875
I'm sorry, you said what?

21:48.875 --> 21:52.250
I'm sure your doctor
told you this was a possibility.

21:52.250 --> 21:56.625
But from what I've read,
babies can pick up
sign language very quickly.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.917
- Hold on.
- We're short-staffed tonight.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.792
The nurse will
prescribe antibiotics.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.834
[rock music plays]

22:09.834 --> 22:13.417
OK. Rough start, but I think
it picked up there at the end.

22:13.417 --> 22:17.500
All I need is a little alone
time to seal the deal.
It won't take much.

22:19.375 --> 22:23.333
I think it might take
more time than you have.
She wants us to drive her home.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.875
- Don't think
she's feeling well.
- When did that happen?

22:26.875 --> 22:30.375
- Maybe she drank too much.
- She had half
a glass of champagne.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.834
You're an awful wingman.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.667
What are you talking about?
I toasted your promotion!

22:37.667 --> 22:41.166
I think we both realize
that you owe me
for a lot of things!

22:41.166 --> 22:44.709
You want the truth? She's not
sick. She just doesn't like you.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.041
She doesn't like me?

22:48.875 --> 22:52.458
You know what? I'll
just talk to her when
I drive her home, you know?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.750
Smooth things over.

23:00.917 --> 23:04.583
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.
Have a good night.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.709
Thanks.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.291
I'm just gonna kiss her
good night again.

23:21.208 --> 23:26.875
So I TiVo'd the Flavor of Love
marathon if you're interested.

23:26.875 --> 23:30.333
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.959
I saw you the
other day at this car.

23:34.959 --> 23:38.083
With this guy.
Talking kind of...

23:38.083 --> 23:42.667
- ...intimately.
- I'm so sorry.

23:42.667 --> 23:47.959
I asked you straight-out if you
were gay and you lied to me.

23:47.959 --> 23:52.000
No, uh, you never let me
answer the question.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.709
Well, I'm asking
you now. Are you gay?

23:59.750 --> 24:00.750
Yeah.

24:04.667 --> 24:08.625
- Then why did you kiss me?
- I don't know.

24:08.625 --> 24:12.583
I don't. I just, um...

24:12.583 --> 24:17.083
It's been kind of a dry spell
and I've been struggling
with this for a while.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.583
And also because, uh...
I was...

24:19.583 --> 24:24.166
I mean, I am...
very attracted to you.

24:24.166 --> 24:28.959
Um, I love your
wacky sense of humor,

24:28.959 --> 24:31.041
your sophistication,
your vulnerability.

24:31.041 --> 24:34.875
- You think I'm wacky?
- When I kissed you,

24:34.875 --> 24:38.583
I swear, it was
with the best of intentions.

24:38.583 --> 24:41.458
I just didn't feel anything.

24:42.792 --> 24:46.750
- You really felt nothing?
- No.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.917
In fact, it was horrible,

24:48.917 --> 24:53.834
but, um, only because
I wanted it so badly.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.875
Deena thinks
that I turned you gay.

24:55.875 --> 25:00.041
Are you kidding me?
You almost single-handedly
turned me straight.

25:00.041 --> 25:04.834
Nicole, you're
an incredibly sexy woman.

25:04.834 --> 25:08.542
But only in theory.

25:08.542 --> 25:13.709
- [pop music plays]
- [both laugh]

25:13.709 --> 25:16.709
[in cartoon voice] Well,
we could try something
like this.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.792
You know what? We need
something a little sexier.

25:20.792 --> 25:24.625
Hm. [Southern accent]
Well, we could try this.

25:24.625 --> 25:28.875
Sort of an itsy bit

39:36.875 --> 39:41.291
I, um, got your chair back
as a gesture.

39:41.291 --> 39:45.041
I'm leaving.
The beanbag's staying.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.750
What? You just moved in.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.959
I think we can tell that this
isn't going to work out.

39:49.959 --> 39:53.792
Sometimes when people
move in together they
can tell right away

39:53.792 --> 39:56.667
if they're not right
for each other.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.875
This is one of those times.

39:58.875 --> 40:02.417
- And you have
that much experience?
- Yeah, I do.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.917
- And I don't have any say?
- You do have a say.

40:04.917 --> 40:08.083
You say it every night when
you go out with your friends

40:08.083 --> 40:10.125
or hang out
with the girls downstairs.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.291
I can't believe
we're back to this again.

40:12.291 --> 40:15.959
It's not about that, Brian.
It's about us and our future.

40:15.959 --> 40:18.917
Which you're throwing away
because you're scared.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.333
You're breaking up
because there's a chance
you might get hurt.

40:22.333 --> 40:25.917
Oh, Brian, I just...

40:25.917 --> 40:29.125
I just don't want
to do this anymore.

40:29.125 --> 40:32.667
When I look at my future,
I don't see us together.

40:32.667 --> 40:37.083
You might not hurt me now,
but you will someday.

40:37.083 --> 40:40.625
- Bridge...
- You can't say that you won't.

40:43.583 --> 40:46.000
- Nobody can, but...
- Don't.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.667
Don't. I always go with my gut,

40:48.667 --> 40:52.625
and... my gut
is telling me to leave.

40:53.917 --> 40:55.375
Bridget, come on.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.834
Let me go, Brian. Please.

40:59.834 --> 41:03.542
[soft rock plays]

41:03.542 --> 41:07.041
Fine. Whatever you want.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.208
Um...

41:12.208 --> 41:15.875
I can, um,
get my stuff tomorrow.

41:15.875 --> 41:18.208
Yeah, whatever.
Take your time.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.542
I can sleep on the couch...

41:21.542 --> 41:23.875
No, no, you take the bed.

[Nicole] That was great.
It was better than great!

41:45.750 --> 41:50.917
It was forceful and masculine
and necessary.

41:50.917 --> 41:55.291
Very necessary. [laughs]

41:55.291 --> 41:59.250
But I don't think I have
to tell you that we can
never ever do this again.

41:59.250 --> 42:03.208
And no one can ever
find out about this. OK?

42:04.875 --> 42:06.875
Absolutely.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.333
It'll be our little secret.
