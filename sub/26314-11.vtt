00:00.250 --> 00:02.170
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:02.170 --> 00:04.880
Mr. Lahey, are you aware that
D.A. Miller has gone missing?

00:04.880 --> 00:07.000
Someone ordered those guards
to kill my pops.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.080
The Governor's gonna come after
the both of us even harder now.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.460
No. Because it was the Governor
who killed Miller.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.250
You should file a civil suit
against the state

00:14.250 --> 00:15.580
on behalf
of Nate Lahey Junior.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.750
Why wouldn't you
bring this to Annalise?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.000
You need this win
more than she does.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.420
Emmett:
This is Annalise's client.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.250
She's too busy to
handle a civil suit.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.580
You okay with me
suing the state?

00:23.580 --> 00:26.330
We have just received word that
Interim District Attorney

00:26.330 --> 00:29.500
Ronald Miller has officially
been named a missing person.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.710
Tell us the truth.
Was this Bonnie?
Nate.

00:31.710 --> 00:35.880
My misconduct wasn't
some gross thing in a copy room.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.540
It was me falling in love
with a client.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.380
C&G wants me to admit
fault under oath.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.330
Agent Telesco: This is
Agent Telesco with the FBI.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.420
We have a few questions
about a voicemail

00:43.420 --> 00:45.120
you left for
D.A. Ronald Miller.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.670
Miller's cellphone battery
was busted.

00:46.670 --> 00:47.960
What if that's why
he was on the payphone --

00:47.960 --> 00:49.460
because his phone
was actually dead?

00:49.460 --> 00:50.540
Miller: I'm calling
to thank you

00:50.540 --> 00:52.790
for handling the
Nate Lahey Senior transfer.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.000
His son works for me.
He's a good guy.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.620
Hey.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.830
Annalise:
Where are you?

01:13.830 --> 01:15.620
Bonnie said that
you were at the FBI.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.790
Yeah.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.830
What?
Um, I'm coming right now.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.210
You can't come
anywhere near this.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.210
And you can't answer
any of their questions.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.460
I gotta go.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.580
Mr. Lahey,
thank you for waiting.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.460
I am
Special Agent Lanford.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.540
This is
Special Agent Bayer.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.080
Let's start with
where were you

01:36.080 --> 01:38.540
on the night
of December 15th?

01:38.540 --> 01:39.710
I was at a wedding.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.460
Why were you
at this wedding?

01:42.460 --> 01:44.420
I was a guest
of Annalise Keating.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.330
Is your relationship with
Ms. Keating romantic?

01:46.330 --> 01:47.250
Just friends.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.330
Friends after
you went to jail

01:49.330 --> 01:50.790
for her husband's
murder?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.750
I was falsely accused.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.170
Acquitted.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.920
Annalise knew that,
to the point

01:56.920 --> 01:59.500
that she took my pops' case
to the Supreme Court.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
That case
didn't end well.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.080
You mean because those guards
murdered my pops?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.120
Miller lost the inquest,
is what I mean.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.670
Miller didn't want
to win that inquest.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.290
What does that mean?

02:11.290 --> 02:13.790
He ordered the inquest
to cover his ass.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.120
For what?

02:18.420 --> 02:20.080
Ordering the hit
on my pops.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.210
Mr. Lahey, if you believe
that's true,

02:26.210 --> 02:28.880
it makes you a suspect
in the D.A.'s disappearance.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
I'm not your suspect.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.120
So who is?

02:34.420 --> 02:35.620
The Governor.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.710
Nate: Why'd you call
the Warden that day?

02:43.710 --> 02:44.710
Own it!
What?! Look.

02:44.710 --> 02:45.880
You feel that pain?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.750
This is Sykes.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.420
Jeff, hey. Ron Miller here.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.960
Oh. I didn't recognize
the number.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.750
Yeah, my phone died.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.750
Uh, listen, I'm calling
to thank you

02:54.750 --> 02:57.500
for handling the
Nate Lahey Senior transfer.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.540
It's not a problem.
Well, still, I just
wanted to say thanks.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.500
His son works for me,
he's a good guy,

03:02.500 --> 03:04.830
so I'd like to make the
transfer as easy as possible

03:04.830 --> 03:07.330
on his old man.
Yeah, we'll take good care
of him. No problem.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.120
Don't tell me you think
this means he's innocent.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.420
We don't know
what this means.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.330
Miller knew about
the Warden's wiretap.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.210
That call was him
covering his ass!

03:16.580 --> 03:18.710
You know I'm right.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.040
Maybe we were wrong.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.540
Fine.
Y'all want proof,

03:24.540 --> 03:26.880
-I'll go get it.
-Stop.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.040
I didn't kill
an innocent man!
No one's saying that.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.670
What is this?
What are you saying?
Think, all right?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.710
If you can prove that Miller
hurt your father,

03:32.710 --> 03:34.750
then you can also prove that
you had motive to kill him.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.210
It proves the Governor
had motive.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.500
Who do you think
the FBI is gonna believe?

03:38.500 --> 03:41.420
The white woman who runs
the whole state? Or you?

03:41.420 --> 03:43.080
You're making yourself
look like a suspect.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.210
I ain't
the bad guy here.

03:46.210 --> 03:47.500
He is.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.210
Call in sick.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.880
The FBI said they might want
to question me again today.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.620
Then come back
after work.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.880
Hurting yourself
is not the answer.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.540
Or that's just what we keep
telling ourselves.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.170
No. It's because
I need you here.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.620
I'm just
going to work.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.830
Oh, fudge.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.120
-AK!
-Are you at the office?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.290
Asher: No.

04:46.290 --> 04:48.000
Get there and
keep an eye on Bonnie.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.380
Why? What's wrong?

04:49.380 --> 04:51.880
Just take care of her.
You're good at that.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.920
Okay,
I thought you were

04:55.920 --> 04:58.920
calling about
something else.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.210
What else
would I be calling about?

05:02.580 --> 05:05.080
Asher?

05:05.080 --> 05:06.920
I'm not the only one
who knows.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.380
Don't worry. We would
never say anything.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.670
Where have I
heard that before?

05:13.670 --> 05:15.120
Should we really be talking
about this here?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.920
This is the last time we're
gonna be talking about it.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.330
-Until the FBI calls us all in.
-That's not gonna happen --

05:19.330 --> 05:20.620
Miller was last seen
at our wedding --

05:20.620 --> 05:21.960
-Did you see him?
-No, but --

05:21.960 --> 05:23.170
What about you two?

05:23.170 --> 05:24.290
-I don't think so.
-Not that I can recall.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.790
That's what
you're gonna tell the FBI.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.250
Where's Laurel?

05:29.210 --> 05:30.540
I'm not
her babysitter --

05:30.540 --> 05:33.040
Well, find her
and shut the hell up.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.290
There are the lovebirds!
How was the wedding?

05:35.290 --> 05:36.500
-So great.
-Wonderful, yeah.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.540
I got to go.
Emmett's waiting for me.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.960
-Today's the "you-know-what"?
-Yeah.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.670
Come by my office after,
I wanted to talk

05:41.670 --> 05:43.880
about the wrongful
death suit...

05:43.880 --> 05:45.670
Uh, about that --
um...

05:45.670 --> 05:48.540
I don't think that Nate is ready
to file anything just yet.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.460
Did you tell him
how much money he could get?

05:50.460 --> 05:52.540
He's more interested
in justice.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.620
I performed
a Christmas miracle

05:54.620 --> 05:56.500
to get Crawford
to approve this case.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.080
So get Nate on board,
or I'll call him myself.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.460
What are you doing?
Nate can't go in a war

06:06.460 --> 06:07.750
against the state
right now.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.250
I'm not calling Nate.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.380
Laurel: It's Laurel.
Leave a message,

06:10.380 --> 06:11.750
but I'll probably never listen.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.040
Hey.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.620
What did
Christopher see?

06:20.620 --> 06:22.750
What?
You said
you were changing him.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.670
Was that a lie?

06:26.460 --> 06:27.750
Oh, no. No.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.000
I don't know
what you mean.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.710
Asher told us
everything.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.170
What did he see?

06:34.170 --> 06:35.750
-Laurel?
-Tell me.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.080
We shouldn't be talking
about this here.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.750
Because he was there
when Nate did it?

06:38.750 --> 06:41.040
No.
Don't lie to me
about my own son.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.290
-Laurel.
-Do you know what happens

06:42.290 --> 06:44.120
to infants
when they see trauma?

06:44.120 --> 06:45.790
Laurel, we cannot
do this here.
Their brains
don't develop right.

06:45.790 --> 06:48.420
He could have PTSD for the rest
of his life, Bonnie.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.830
I don't think
he saw anything.

06:49.830 --> 06:51.210
You don't think?!
Enough, okay?!

06:51.210 --> 06:53.580
Stop! Look, she lost
her boyfriend.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.420
She is in pain, too.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.620
Good.
'Cause that's the only thing

06:58.620 --> 07:00.710
that's keeping me
from killing her right now.

07:05.290 --> 07:06.330
You okay?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.620
You promised Nate
you wouldn't tell them.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.960
Mr. Sakai.

07:32.330 --> 07:34.710
In the matter of
Nathaniel Lahey Senior's death,

07:34.710 --> 07:37.500
we, the jury, find
no evidence of criminal acts

07:37.500 --> 07:39.880
or negligence
by anyone involved.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.920
The judge said we're not
supposed to talk to you.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.250
I just have a few questions.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.120
We had to make that ruling
based on the evidence.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.460
The only evidence was
those guards' testimonies.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.620
That's not true.
They lied on the stand

07:49.620 --> 07:51.620
because they were ordered
to do so.

07:51.620 --> 07:54.170
Your father's DNA
was on the gun.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.380
I was at the inquest.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.460
No one ever presented
any DNA evidence.

07:59.460 --> 08:02.170
It was in the evidence packet
we got during deliberations.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.120
Packet?
You got from who?

08:05.380 --> 08:07.080
I think the Bailiff
brought it.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.170
Texting how you keep
your head in the game?

08:22.170 --> 08:23.580
My head is always
in the game.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.080
Reception just called.
The Brits are on their way up.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.500
"The Brits."
Please try not
to be combative.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.920
Why? You nervous?

08:33.920 --> 08:35.330
To see Nora, no,

08:35.330 --> 08:37.210
but Pierce Jensen,
on the other hand...

08:37.210 --> 08:38.420
Well, you steer him
my way.

08:38.420 --> 08:40.670
I enjoy smacking down
uppity white men.

08:40.670 --> 08:42.040
Well, he's your boss,
too, Annalise.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.750
Well, so are you.
It never stopped me.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.000
Hey.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.670
-Hmm?
-Game face on.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.250
Mm. It's on.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.710
Ah, Crawford, good to see you.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.710
Thank you
for making the trip over.
Mm.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.330
-Nora.
-Hi.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.040
-Who are you?
-Annalise Keating.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.540
Ah, of course.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.290
We must have a drink
while I'm in town.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.250
Right now, we all have
a meeting to go to.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.670
I know.
I'm in it.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.790
I thought the more brain power
on this, the better.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.210
Shall we?

09:26.040 --> 09:27.670
This is the board-approved
script we drew up

09:27.670 --> 09:29.920
for tomorrow's deposition
with the FTC.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.460
Crawford will go first.
You'll testify that,

09:32.460 --> 09:35.460
while representing
Nora's DNA-testing company,

09:35.460 --> 09:38.040
you engaged in an intimate
relationship with her.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.460
They know
it was consensual, right?

09:39.460 --> 09:42.000
Yes. The only violation
they're investigating

09:42.000 --> 09:44.080
is the sale of
your customers' genetic info

09:44.080 --> 09:45.460
to Beck Pharmaceuticals --

09:45.460 --> 09:47.210
a sale you'll say
you agreed to

09:47.210 --> 09:49.080
because Crawford
failed to advise you

09:49.080 --> 09:51.380
of the legal
consequences.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.330
Everyone sticks to
the script tomorrow,

09:53.330 --> 09:56.040
C&G covers the fines,
no one goes bankrupt.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.790
What if we wanted
to do another script?

09:59.170 --> 10:01.500
Ms. Keating brought up the idea
that we move liability

10:01.500 --> 10:03.920
from C&G and Nora
to Beck Pharmaceutical.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.830
-Ah.
-Beck was fined

10:05.830 --> 10:08.420
for buying genetic information
two years prior.

10:08.420 --> 10:10.380
That means they understood
the consequences,

10:10.380 --> 10:12.250
and yet
ignored FTC rules.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.670
Nora was played.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.380
Emmett, if you're having
second thoughts...

10:17.380 --> 10:19.000
Jensen: No one's having
second thoughts.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.290
If we point the finger at Beck,
if they go public,

10:21.290 --> 10:22.960
Nora's stock plummets.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.830
But if Emmett
doesn't want to do this...

10:24.830 --> 10:27.460
But C&G wants
Emmett to do this.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.460
So unless you want
to lose your company

10:30.460 --> 10:33.960
and you two want to avoid
C&G going down

10:33.960 --> 10:37.080
and losing both your jobs,
we proceed as planned.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.670
Everyone happy?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.080
Great.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.960
Where's Gabriel?

10:52.960 --> 10:55.670
Who cares?
Where the hell have you been?

10:55.670 --> 10:56.880
Threatening Bonnie.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.250
None of you are
parents, okay?

10:59.250 --> 11:00.420
You don't get it.
Look at him.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.120
He seems happy.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.920
He might seem happy, but I read
that kids who witness violence

11:04.920 --> 11:06.710
are more likely to struggle
with mental health issues later.

11:06.710 --> 11:07.710
Why would you
tell her that?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.040
-Connor!
-See?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.420
I'm just saying that Laurel
has a right to be upset.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.670
-No, you just made her upset.
-I agree.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.250
-Christopher's gonna be fine.
-Well, I'm not.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.790
Tell Annalise
I'm taking a sick day.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.790
Wait, wait, wait.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.000
She knows we know.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.420
-Asher?
-Obviously.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.670
So start prepping
your interview for the FBI.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.710
Agent Telesco:
Thank you for finally
coming in, Mr. Maddox.

11:42.710 --> 11:45.040
I'm here voluntarily.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.120
Federal law doesn't require me
to answer any of your questions.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.000
True.
But not answering

11:50.000 --> 11:51.380
will make the voicemail
you left for D.A. Miller

11:51.380 --> 11:52.500
more suspicious.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.380
Gabriel: I screwed up.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.420
They found out who I am.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.790
Can you call me back?

12:03.250 --> 12:04.750
Who are the "they"
you're referring to?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.620
Annalise Keating.
You said "they."

12:06.620 --> 12:09.040
Yeah, meaning her and some of
the people that work for her.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.460
Is one of those people
Nate Lahey?

12:11.460 --> 12:13.040
No.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.080
I mean,
not that I know of.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.000
Explain what you meant by,
"They found out who I am."

12:18.000 --> 12:19.670
I was helping D.A. Miller
with an investigation

12:19.670 --> 12:22.120
into Professor Keating.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.750
What kind
of investigation?

12:24.750 --> 12:26.540
I'm not sure.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.040
He just said the D.A. before him
had suspected Keating

12:29.040 --> 12:30.880
of being involved in
a bunch of criminal acts.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.750
How did D.A. Miller
think you could help

12:33.750 --> 12:35.620
with this investigation?

12:35.620 --> 12:37.380
Mm.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.580
I was a new student.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.830
I guess he figured I wouldn't
be so loyal to her yet.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.750
Mr. Maddox, when was the last
time you saw D.A. Miller?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.580
In person?

12:47.580 --> 12:50.880
A-A month,
maybe two months ago.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.290
So you didn't see him
at the wedding?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.040
No, I-I didn't even know
he was there.

12:59.210 --> 13:00.750
Did you know Nate Lahey
was there?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.210
Yeah.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.620
Yeah, he was -- he was there
with Professor Keating.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.040
Why?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.460
I'm asking the questions
here, Mr. Maddox.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.750
-Out.
-No, I-I need you to know

13:21.750 --> 13:22.830
that they figured it out
on their own.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.710
Fine. Now go.

13:24.710 --> 13:25.580
BonBon, please.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.330
What can I do
to help?

13:28.330 --> 13:30.330
Tell Annalise
I'm fine.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.830
What?
She told you
to watch me?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.210
Did she
tell you why?

13:37.210 --> 13:39.460
No. I mean,

13:39.460 --> 13:41.670
I-I know how awful
all this is for you.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.040
You were right, Asher.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.620
About what?

13:46.620 --> 13:49.790
Ron's call
to the Warden.

13:49.790 --> 13:52.880
He was just checking to see
if Senior's transfer went okay.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.790
Look, you --

14:00.790 --> 14:02.790
you can't -- you can't
take this all on yourself.

14:04.670 --> 14:05.960
Of course I can.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.580
No, y-you did
nothing wrong.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.620
It was me, Asher.

14:14.330 --> 14:18.460
He was still breathing
when I got there.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.330
Nate was in shock.
I could've called 911.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.620
It was me.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.080
Hey.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.420
Nate:
You find something?

14:42.420 --> 14:43.330
Yeah.
I tracked the number

14:43.330 --> 14:44.330
to a payphone
on Reed and 20th.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.500
Check your e-mail.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.120
Why'd you call the Warden
that day?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.330
What do you need?

14:49.330 --> 14:51.670
Miller slipped
a DNA test to the jury

14:51.670 --> 14:53.750
during my pops' inquest.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.960
I think it was
doctored somehow.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.670
I just need
a copy of the test.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.420
Since when do you
turn down a job?

15:03.420 --> 15:06.120
Since the D.A.
went missing.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.960
-What happened that night?
-Hell if I know.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.830
I sent you the photo of the guy
on the payphone,

15:10.830 --> 15:12.380
then he disappears.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.960
'Cause the people
he was working for

15:13.960 --> 15:16.880
were afraid
he was gonna snitch.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.080
Come on. I wouldn't ask
if I had another way.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.790
Let's see what I find.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.420
Hey, can we talk?

15:36.420 --> 15:37.830
We have nothing
to talk about.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.830
Not here,
not anywhere.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.540
Tegan: What's the verdict,
Ms. Pratt?

15:43.540 --> 15:45.540
Have you convinced Lahey to sign
on to our wrongful death suit?

15:45.540 --> 15:47.920
Uh, I was just going
to come talk to you --

15:47.920 --> 15:49.500
The only appropriate response
there was "yes" --

15:49.500 --> 15:51.250
Okay, I was looking over
the brief and realized

15:51.250 --> 15:52.790
we can't effectively
establish damages

15:52.790 --> 15:54.460
without
witnesses testifying

15:54.460 --> 15:56.040
about Nate's relationship
with his father.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.080
We'll use the prison guards
who monitored their visits.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.120
You mean the guards
at the same prison

15:59.120 --> 16:00.210
where Nate Senior
was murdered?

16:00.210 --> 16:03.210
Yeah, uh,
I looked up the statistics

16:03.210 --> 16:05.380
on these types of cases --
most don't succeed

16:05.380 --> 16:08.120
without two or more
unbiased witnesses.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.080
What is this?
Laziness?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.420
'Cause I can easily
hate you at a 10 again.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.040
No, I-I just don't want
to get Nate's hopes up

16:14.040 --> 16:15.460
if we're not gonna win.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.540
You don't need
witnesses to win.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.420
You just need to establish
the basis for punitive damages.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.080
Exactly.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.880
Your 2L just
outsmarted all of you.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.210
I'll knock on Nate's door
myself if I have to.

16:31.830 --> 16:33.040
I didn't
mean to overstep.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.120
Your middle name
is overstep.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.880
It's Nate --
I'm just trying to help.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.250
Well, stop.
Why?

16:38.250 --> 16:39.880
Is something
going on with him?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.380
How the hell
would we know?

16:41.380 --> 16:43.170
He was at your wedding.
I assumed you guys were tight.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.830
Well, you were
at our wedding.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.040
Do you think
that means we're "tight"?

16:48.460 --> 16:49.830
Right.

16:55.830 --> 16:57.080
I hate our lives.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.710
Maybe I just
take the hit.

17:02.710 --> 17:05.040
-No, we can solve this.
-I committed misconduct --

17:05.040 --> 17:07.500
-You slept with someone.
-A client.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.080
Nora made that sale
after you told her not to.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.380
-Isn't that true?
-Yes.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.580
Then how is that
your fault?

17:12.580 --> 17:14.790
Because she believed she could
save lives. Literally.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.380
Breast cancer,
Alzheimer's --

17:16.380 --> 17:18.170
she knew that selling
that genetic information

17:18.170 --> 17:20.250
could lead to cures --

17:20.250 --> 17:21.960
You mean money --
No, money --

17:21.960 --> 17:23.170
that was
never her thing.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.920
Money's
everybody's thing.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.120
She's a female CEO working
in science, Annalise.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.170
I'm just
an entitled white guy

17:30.170 --> 17:33.210
who grew up with every advantage
this world has to offer.

17:33.210 --> 17:36.170
You know, maybe this is my way
to balance the scales a bit.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.380
Y-You think I'm soft.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.880
You're gonna
bleed yourself dry

17:40.880 --> 17:43.750
if you keep putting everyone
else's needs before your own.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.000
You mean
like you do?

17:47.580 --> 17:49.960
You know the times I've gotten
into the most trouble?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.790
When I don't put me first.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.170
Someone trying
to bleed you dry?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.380
I'll be back
in a bit.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.460
Here.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.250
It's the DNA test
Miller gave to the jury

18:13.250 --> 18:14.920
after the inquest.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.210
Who gave you this?

18:16.210 --> 18:18.210
Just look --
it says my pops' DNA

18:18.210 --> 18:20.170
was found
on the guard's gun.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.460
Miller never presented that
in court.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.920
That's because
prosecutors are allowed

18:22.920 --> 18:24.960
to present evidence
to the jury in private.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.380
He didn't present it,
though.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.330
He had the Bailiff slip it
to them when we weren't looking.

18:28.330 --> 18:29.750
That's why we lost --

18:29.750 --> 18:31.670
because Miller messed
with this test.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.290
What?

18:37.290 --> 18:39.540
Even if this test
is fake...
It is.

18:39.540 --> 18:42.620
...there is no evidence that
Miller gave it to the jury.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.790
Who else would it be?
The Governor.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.960
Who Miller
was working for!
According to you.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.250
Because, literally, that's
the only evidence we have

18:49.250 --> 18:50.750
that Miller actually
did this --

18:50.750 --> 18:52.670
your gut, which is not enough
to convict a man in court.

18:52.670 --> 18:54.380
I'm sorry. It's not.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.710
After all the times I've gone
along with your insane plans...

18:56.710 --> 18:58.420
I'm not saying
that you're wrong.
Trusted you
every step of the way.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.380
Nate, you are literally
taking a shovel

19:00.380 --> 19:01.710
and digging
your own grave.

19:01.710 --> 19:03.790
Then that's the risk
I got to take.
No.

19:03.790 --> 19:06.120
You hear me? No!

19:06.120 --> 19:07.750
You want
to be right here,

19:07.750 --> 19:09.670
otherwise you feel that
the guilt is gonna kill you.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.710
I get it. You're human.
You're right.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.500
But you can't force
something to be true

19:13.500 --> 19:14.880
just because
you want it to be.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.080

Where's Bonnie?
Resting.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.380
What do you need?

22:42.380 --> 22:45.120
A chain of custody report
on a gun.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.710
She can't
get you that.

22:46.710 --> 22:48.960
What's up?
She not okay?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.790
Don't worry about her.
Just...

22:51.790 --> 22:54.040
stop with
all the digging.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.420
Annalise tell you
to say that?

22:55.420 --> 22:57.170
I'm telling you that,

22:57.170 --> 22:59.210
because I'm worried.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.290
The guy
who does what I do.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.540
So you should
be worried, too.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.620
We've all done horrible
things, Laurel, you included!

23:21.620 --> 23:24.420
I'm an adult, okay?
I chose to do those things.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.880
Meanwhile, Christopher
can't even walk.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.210
Bonnie said he didn't
see anything!

23:27.210 --> 23:29.040
She thinks he didn't
see anything.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.250
-Can we all just take a breath?
-Look, he's a baby.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.830
He's gonna be fine.
He's already not fine.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.710
How do you know that?
Because I'm his mother!

23:34.710 --> 23:37.170
-I can tell he's different!
-Why don't I make s'mores?

23:37.170 --> 23:39.000
Okay, you know who else
is different?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.250
Bonnie, okay, who lost
the love of her life.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.420
I lost
the love of my life,

23:43.420 --> 23:46.120
so I will do
whatever I need to do

23:46.120 --> 23:47.750
to make sure
my son is safe.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.080
Michaela: Hey!

23:49.080 --> 23:50.540
I can hear you
in my room,

23:50.540 --> 23:51.920
which means
Christopher can, too.

23:53.460 --> 23:57.120
Great. So now
I'm traumatizing him, too.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.460
No, that's not
what I meant.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.420
What good does it do
to make Bonnie hate herself

24:02.420 --> 24:03.420
even more than
she already does?

24:05.880 --> 24:08.250
Come here.
I'm fine.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.080
No, you're not.
Bring it in.

24:24.210 --> 24:25.540
Michaela:
Did he wake up?

24:28.420 --> 24:29.460
No.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.580
Do you think
I'm being crazy?

24:40.580 --> 24:42.210
You're his mom.

24:42.210 --> 24:43.880
It's your job
to be crazy for him.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.880
Maybe I'm just
being paranoid.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.250
Not necessarily.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.500
Say it.

25:10.830 --> 25:14.540
I am on your side,
always,

25:14.540 --> 25:17.420
but it is really unlikely
he's gonna remember any of this.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.620
You don't know that.
I do.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.120
Uh...

25:26.750 --> 25:30.880
I was in the same room with my
birth mother when she was shot.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.670
I was two.

25:32.670 --> 25:35.330
That's why Social Services
took me, and...

25:37.710 --> 25:39.710
...I don't remember
any of it.

25:39.710 --> 25:42.290
Honestly, it's like
it never happened.

25:42.290 --> 25:47.420
So that's how I know
he's gonna be fine.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.170
Because...

25:50.170 --> 25:52.040
look how great
I turned out.

26:17.580 --> 26:19.210
I only have
a few minutes.
I know.

26:22.670 --> 26:24.920
I want to admit
fault tomorrow.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.330
Stop.
This was
my bad decision.

26:27.330 --> 26:29.540
It wasn't yours.
You had
the right intentions.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.420
I know you think you're
doing the right thing.

26:31.420 --> 26:35.120
I did, too. It's why
I let it come this far.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.040
But now
that we're here,

26:37.040 --> 26:40.290
as much as I wish
I could be okay with this,

26:40.290 --> 26:41.960
I can't
let you do this.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.620
You mean more to me
than this company.

26:49.380 --> 26:52.080
You built this company
from nothing,

26:52.080 --> 26:53.330
and I'm just
some lawyer,

26:53.330 --> 26:57.540
so just...
let me do this for you.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.420
At least so I can say

26:59.420 --> 27:01.250
I did something good
for the world.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.960
So that's it?
All she has to do

27:17.960 --> 27:20.080
is drop a few crocodile tears,
and you cave?

27:20.080 --> 27:22.250
That's not
what's happening.
That's cool. Get yours.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.000
But don't have me
busting my ass for nothing.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.420
She told me not to do it,
Annalise.

27:25.420 --> 27:26.960
She was
manipulating you.
No.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.040
It was reverse psychology,
or are you that ignorant?

27:33.620 --> 27:35.250
Don't you --

27:35.250 --> 27:37.210
Don't you want
to die knowing

27:37.210 --> 27:38.920
you lived for something
other than yourself?

27:42.080 --> 27:44.620
Okay, you know what?
Do it.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.790
Be the martyr.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.920
See where that gets you.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.080
What's taking
so long?

28:03.080 --> 28:06.420
Your badge number's
not coming up in my system.

28:06.420 --> 28:11.040
Look, all I need is a chain
of custody report on that gun --

28:11.040 --> 28:12.460
not a big deal.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.250
It is if my supervisor
finds out

28:14.250 --> 28:15.670
I gave it to you
without clearance.

28:15.670 --> 28:17.790
I have clearance.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.120
I know you don't work
at the D.A.'s anymore.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.000
So you knew that
this whole time?

28:23.380 --> 28:25.330
That why you stalling?

28:25.330 --> 28:27.210
You making time
to bury evidence?
Sir, calm down.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.920
I was on the force
for years.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.540
You're risking
an arrest.
I know
what goes on here.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.170
You're helping cover up an old
man's murder -- you hear me?!

28:32.170 --> 28:34.710
Agent Telesco:
Mr. Lahey,

28:34.710 --> 28:37.250
I have some agents who would
like to ask you a few questions.

28:40.830 --> 28:43.170
You called them?

28:43.170 --> 28:45.120
Cuffs are only optional
for the next five seconds.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.080
Hey.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.330
Annalise:
Where are you?

29:16.330 --> 29:18.540
Bonnie said that
you were at the FBI.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.460
Yeah.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.330
What? Um,
I'm coming right now.

29:21.330 --> 29:23.170
You can't come
anywhere near this.

29:23.170 --> 29:25.710
And you can't answer
any of their questions.

29:27.790 --> 29:28.790
I gotta go.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.830
Miss Keating?
Mr. Crawford needs to see you.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.250
Tegan: Wait up!

29:43.250 --> 29:44.380
I assume you finally
got to meet

29:44.380 --> 29:46.000
our little Miss Conduct?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.290
With all the crap
she's giving Crawford,

29:47.290 --> 29:48.670
at least
tell me she's hot.

29:48.670 --> 29:51.460
She's fine.
Like, fine,
or, like, fine?

29:51.460 --> 29:53.000
What?
She's not your type?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.420
Do you need something?

29:54.420 --> 29:56.670
It's about Nate's
wrongful death suit.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.790
Michaela's been trying
to get his signature.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.460
Well, failing at it --

30:00.460 --> 30:02.420
Stop.

30:02.420 --> 30:03.670
I'm sorry?
Nate's not ready
to give up

30:03.670 --> 30:05.420
on the possibility
of a criminal trial.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.250
If we file a civil suit,
we lose,

30:07.250 --> 30:08.500
the opportunity
goes away.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.500
That's the real fight
he's interested in.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.920
O-Okay.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.120
I'll stop.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.750
Thanks for your help,
though.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.620
Ms. Pratt?
We need to talk.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.170
Uh, great.

30:25.170 --> 30:27.920
Uh, I-I finally
spoke to Nate.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.500
You did?
Yes.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.250
And although he appreciates
all your hard work,

30:31.250 --> 30:33.420
he doesn't want to take on
any more fights right now.

30:33.420 --> 30:34.880
Really?

30:34.880 --> 30:36.330
He doesn't even want
a criminal trial?

30:36.330 --> 30:38.960
Can you blame him?
I mean, he'd be an idiot

30:38.960 --> 30:40.580
to still have any faith
in the system.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.750
-Why are you all lying?
-No one's lying.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.500
I was with Michaela
when she spoke with Nate.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.290
You're all
full of it.

30:52.290 --> 30:54.120
I can't believe
you'd do this to me again.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.210
You're a Boy Scout
or a romantic --

31:11.210 --> 31:12.960
I can't tell which,
but, either way,

31:12.960 --> 31:15.750
I can't stand by and
let you be this firm's bitch.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.040
So here's a way out.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.080
We make Jensen
take the fall.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.580
He's so keen on saving
Nora's company and C&G,

31:23.580 --> 31:25.790
so let's take the sword
he wants you to fall on

31:25.790 --> 31:27.620
and stab him with it.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.710
Huh.

31:28.710 --> 31:30.710
No "huh." Yeah.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.040
It's a great idea.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.330
I agree.

31:33.330 --> 31:34.580
I had the same one.

31:39.380 --> 31:40.830
Jensen:
What are you thinking?

31:40.830 --> 31:43.000
The bloody deposition's
in five minutes.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.750
The deposition
can continue as planned.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.080
It's just gonna be you
in the hot seat.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.420
-The hell it is.
-Oh, so you're okay

31:48.420 --> 31:49.580
with Nora's company
going bankrupt?

31:49.580 --> 31:50.670
Excuse me?

31:50.670 --> 31:52.960
I might have to
come clean in there.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.750
Well, I told you
I was okay with that.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.250
Yeah, but he's not.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.540
The whole firm
could go belly-up,

31:57.540 --> 31:59.330
and that's why they jumped
at the chance

31:59.330 --> 32:01.330
of using me as a scapegoat
in the first place.

32:01.330 --> 32:02.620
But now we have
a new scapegoat.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.880
Now I see why the board
didn't want you here.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.670
Your crazy's
contagious.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.880
-This was my idea.
-Great,

32:09.880 --> 32:11.120
then I'll be happy
to fire you both.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.250
That would be
wrongful termination.
How?

32:13.250 --> 32:14.790
It's retaliatory
to fire Mr. Crawford

32:14.790 --> 32:16.380
on the very day that
he's filing

32:16.380 --> 32:18.620
a "hostile work environment"
claim against you.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.080
I submitted the paperwork
this morning.

32:23.380 --> 32:26.040
Sir?
The FTC's ready to begin.

32:26.040 --> 32:26.960
We need
a few minutes.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.120
I'm not doing this.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.040
Fine.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.830
But I really
did love you.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.710
Pierce gave me
the advice.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.540
Remember?

32:41.540 --> 32:43.920
I asked you
if the sale was legal,

32:43.920 --> 32:46.960
and you said it would clear
all regulatory agencies,

32:46.960 --> 32:49.210
and I trusted you,

32:49.210 --> 32:51.290
because you have so much
experience and power,

32:51.290 --> 32:53.250
and you said,
"Yes, do it."

32:55.290 --> 32:58.120
-You're all mad.
-Hmm.

33:01.710 --> 33:04.420
You realize we're sitting ducks
at the firm now.

33:04.420 --> 33:06.290
I'm used to it.

33:06.290 --> 33:08.000
How about we celebrate?
Dinner on me.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.380
I won't drink.

33:09.380 --> 33:10.880
Isn't your girlfriend
in town?

33:10.880 --> 33:13.000
Ex-girlfriend.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.670
You have to close one door
to open a new one, right?

33:24.380 --> 33:25.580
Agent Lanford: Why would
the Governor be involved

33:25.580 --> 33:27.540
in D.A. Miller's
disappearance?

33:27.540 --> 33:30.830
Miller's who arranged for
my father's transfer that night.

33:30.830 --> 33:32.920
-You have proof of that?
-It seems like your team

33:32.920 --> 33:35.250
could get better intel
on someone that high up.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.830
You realize how
this sounds, Mr. Lahey.

33:38.830 --> 33:39.960
Tell me.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.710
Approaching
a juror...

33:42.710 --> 33:45.120
Your father's DNA
was on the gun.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.880
...illegally obtaining
the D.A.'s inquest file.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.960
Miller slipped
a DNA test to the jury

33:49.960 --> 33:51.830
during my pops' inquest.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.120
Unfortunately, those aren't
the only erratic behaviors

33:54.120 --> 33:55.580
you've demonstrated
this week.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.960
Nate: Hey. Wagner.

33:58.290 --> 34:00.710
That guard was the one
who shot my pops.

34:00.710 --> 34:02.540
What about the episode
in the police station

34:02.540 --> 34:04.080
earlier today?

34:04.080 --> 34:06.210
You call that
stable behavior?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.000
What are you
asking me?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.580
Have you had any mental-health
episodes in the past?

34:10.580 --> 34:12.290
No.

34:12.290 --> 34:13.920
Mental illness runs
in your family, though.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.500
342 days in the SHU
broke my pops.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.250
So you understand
how traumatic events

34:19.250 --> 34:21.290
often trigger
mental illness.

34:21.290 --> 34:24.380
Get a psychiatrist
in here.

34:24.380 --> 34:26.120
I'll prove
I'm not making this up.

34:34.290 --> 34:36.380
They asked me
every question they could,

34:36.380 --> 34:38.080
and I didn't
hold nothing back.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.380
Until they finally
let me go.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.080
After you gave them
your DNA. Why?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.750
To see if it matches
my pops' on the gun.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.710
It won't,

34:46.710 --> 34:49.580
which will prove
Miller doctored that test.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.420
And if it wasn't him?

34:52.420 --> 34:53.960
Hey, come on.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.000
We don't know
he did this, Nate.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.540
Maybe you're right.
Fine.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.790
But you were
protecting me.

35:09.830 --> 35:12.250
That's all.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.420
So no matter what --

35:13.420 --> 35:16.250
whether I'm wrong
about him or right --

35:16.250 --> 35:18.170
we both know
this started with me.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.710
No.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.750
I did it.
For me.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.670
So don't even think
about leaving us.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.040
I couldn't live
with that.

Laurel, we can't deal
with this right now.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.170
There's Tegan, too.

37:31.170 --> 37:32.790
Yeah, she told me about
the wrongful death suit.

37:32.790 --> 37:34.880
Did she tell you
she's all crazy suspicious, too?

37:54.540 --> 37:56.750
Leave a brief message.

37:56.750 --> 37:59.210
Claire, hi.
It's Tegan Price.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.620
My immunity deal?
You're listed as Jane Doe
in all the paperwork,

38:01.620 --> 38:03.330
so go to work,
keep your nose down.

38:03.330 --> 38:04.960
No one will know.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.880
I saw you were
back in town.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.620
I wanted to meet up
if you have time.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.620
Call me.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.330
I wanted to meet up
if you have time.

38:14.330 --> 38:15.620
Call me.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.420
Mr. Lahey,
have a seat.

38:21.420 --> 38:23.420
Not if you're just
gonna arrest me.

38:23.420 --> 38:25.580
That's not
why we're here.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.750
Connor: Can we at least
figure out a plan

38:26.750 --> 38:28.420
for when the FBI
calls us?

38:28.420 --> 38:29.620
We don't know that
they're gonna question us.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.330
Nate killed Miller
at our wedding.

38:31.330 --> 38:32.290
Of course they're
gonna question us.

38:32.290 --> 38:34.170
And our parents,
everyone they invited.

38:34.170 --> 38:36.040
Hey.
We don't need a plan --

38:36.040 --> 38:37.250
Why? 'Cause we're finally
gonna turn ourselves in?

38:37.250 --> 38:39.290
No, because
Nate has a plan.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.830
-And it's a good one. Smart.
-What is it?

38:42.040 --> 38:43.790
The Governor
killed Miller.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.880
Say you understand.

38:52.710 --> 38:54.670
We understand.

38:54.670 --> 38:56.880
The rest of you?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.620
-Yes.
-Got it.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.880
Laurel?

39:01.670 --> 39:03.290
Okay.

39:03.290 --> 39:04.920
Good. Now we're
on the same page.

39:07.250 --> 39:10.880
We just got
the DNA results back.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.620
We did what you said.

39:12.620 --> 39:14.500
We checked the DNA
on Officer Gladden's gun

39:14.500 --> 39:17.620
against your own,
which would match your father's.

39:17.620 --> 39:20.290
There was no match.

39:20.290 --> 39:22.830
Which means
you were right --

39:22.830 --> 39:25.330
someone manufactured
those positive results.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.500
Miller.

39:31.330 --> 39:34.080
We're not there yet.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.460
But we have
someone in custody

39:35.460 --> 39:37.380
who we hope will shed light
on Miller's involvement.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.330
Bonnie: You've reached
Bonnie Winterbottom.

39:41.330 --> 39:42.960
Please leave a message.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.170
Bonnie,
where the hell are you?

39:46.170 --> 39:48.330
Call me back.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.210
Bonnie: Frank?

40:02.670 --> 40:04.830
I just didn't
want to sleep alone.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.710
Hello?

40:19.710 --> 40:21.330
Cruz: Annalise Keating?

40:21.330 --> 40:23.880
I'm Officer Cruz calling
from the 18th Street Precinct.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.250
We have someone in custody
who claims you're their lawyer.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.210
Who is it?

40:28.210 --> 40:30.250
-It's Nate.
-Or Simon's finally back.

40:30.250 --> 40:31.580
Quiet.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.120
Gabriel:
Professor Keating?

40:40.710 --> 40:42.330
I think
I need a lawyer.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.880
I'm hoping that's you.
