WEBVTT

07:54.558 --> 07:55.559
Let's go.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.112
Anything good?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.158
But look!

08:11.241 --> 08:12.826
There were free shoes
in the closet!

08:13.660 --> 08:16.163
Don't wear those,
Toni, they're gross.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.709
Can we go out
and do something fun?

08:20.792 --> 08:21.793
No.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.879
I saw online there's lots to do

08:23.962 --> 08:25.547
around here like shopping,

08:25.631 --> 08:28.342
a mall with
over thirty restaurants.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.760
Not tonight.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.553
On the way back
we can do some sightseeing.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.600
Look! Godzilla!

08:36.683 --> 08:37.809
You like this one.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.771
I don't feel like it.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.863
Why does Nick have
guns in the van?

08:49.947 --> 08:51.323
I don't know.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.242
But all Americans have guns.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.868
Nick wants to seem important.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.247
He said he knew my dad.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.834
He shouldn't be talking to you
about things like that.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
You're right.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.047
You should.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.219
Did you ever think there's
a reason I keep things from you?

09:12.302 --> 09:13.679
That I'm protecting you
from something?

09:14.554 --> 09:19.851
I wanted you to have
a normal life before all this.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.104
A normal life?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.731
I'm fifteen
and my mom is my only friend.

09:24.815 --> 09:25.816
What kind of life is that?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.110
Come on, what about Ana?

09:28.193 --> 09:29.444
We haven't been friends
for years

09:29.528 --> 09:31.321
since you stopped letting
her come over.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.116
Is this about the boy
in the chapel?

09:34.199 --> 09:36.493
Why do you act
like this isn't important?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.579
I'm just supposed
to stay at home?

09:39.663 --> 09:42.582
No friends, no job, nothing?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.376
You'd have to be insane
to do that!

09:45.419 --> 09:46.712
Like me?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.134
Where are you going?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.802
To the vending machine.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.346
And when I'm back
we'll watch Godzilla.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.703
What?!

12:24.786 --> 12:26.455
- What's wrong?
- Come to our room.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.915
- Is Nick in trouble?
- Nick is always in trouble.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.667
I got us some Red Vines.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.210
They taste like plastic.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.837
Well then I'll eat them.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.188
What did he tell you?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.740
I was just a young,
stupid girl.

33:12.241 --> 33:13.826
It's nothing to be proud of.

33:53.657 --> 33:54.575
Get up, Toni.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.577
C'mon, let's go!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.129
What the fuck?!

34:07.212 --> 34:08.922
- This is crazy!
- Watch your mouth!

34:09.006 --> 34:10.007
You're joking.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.467
Come on, we have to hurry.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.760
What's going on?
You're scaring me!

34:14.136 --> 34:15.345
We can't just leave Nick.

34:15.971 --> 34:16.972
Yes we can, let's go!

38:29.016 --> 38:30.976
Not sure which way to go, huh?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.272
Too bad we ditched
our navigator.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.609
Good thing I know how to work
the tracking equipment.

38:39.693 --> 38:40.694
What?!

38:41.987 --> 38:43.947
I've been watching Nick do it.

38:44.031 --> 38:45.782
I could do it blindfolded.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.492
Well get to it!

38:48.035 --> 38:50.328
First, tell me what
the "package" is.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.540
Or should we go pick up Nick?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.712
It's not a "what."

39:00.380 --> 39:02.215
But a "who."

39:04.468 --> 39:05.969
The "package"...

39:07.429 --> 39:08.930
...is a man.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.892
One of us.

39:14.644 --> 39:18.523
He broke the rules
and it's our job to find him.

39:19.816 --> 39:23.695
And if we don't a lot of people
will be in grave danger.

39:26.073 --> 39:30.035
That's why we can't take chances
with "fun Nick."

39:31.912 --> 39:32.913
See?

39:33.663 --> 39:35.707
Why couldn't you
just tell me that?

39:37.292 --> 39:39.044
We could have avoided this.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.674
I wasn't sure you'd understand.

39:47.928 --> 39:49.346
I was afraid.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.891
There's a lot more to this
than the chapel, huh?

40:00.774 --> 40:02.609
Can you work that thing or not?

47:36.437 --> 47:37.355
What's that sound mean?

47:37.438 --> 47:38.815
Umm, I don't know.

47:41.901 --> 47:42.902
What's happening?!

47:52.495 --> 47:53.538
Are you ok?

47:54.914 --> 47:56.332
I think we're here.
