WEBVTT

00:04.422 --> 00:07.483
Initiating secondary diagnostics... now.

00:09.846 --> 00:11.899
- No variances.
- Are you sure?

00:12.019 --> 00:14.287
- Yeah, positive.
- Well, check again.

00:14.947 --> 00:17.540
- Rodney, there's nothing here.
- Okay, just get over here, and...

00:17.660 --> 00:19.175
monitor power readings.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.532
No variances.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.829
You catching any discrepancies
on your end?

00:29.949 --> 00:31.471
- Nothing.
<i>- You sure?</i>

00:31.896 --> 00:34.466
- Rodney!
- Okay, just go back, go back...

00:35.156 --> 00:37.565
All right, do we know
what the problem is?

00:37.962 --> 00:40.571
- Yeah. The Gate's not working.
- I think we figured that much

00:40.691 --> 00:43.092
- last week when you broke it?
- I did not break the Gate.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.090
It just stopped working around the same
time you were screwing around with it.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.550
I wasn't screwing around with it!
I was running a program

00:48.670 --> 00:50.168
to boost its operating efficiency.

00:50.290 --> 00:51.512
Yeah, well, good job.

00:51.632 --> 00:54.628
It had nothing to do with
why the Gate malfunctioned!

00:54.748 --> 00:58.127
We've been able to eliminate a number of
possible reasons, including my program,

00:58.247 --> 01:00.040
I feel confident
we're making some progress,

01:00.160 --> 01:03.157
and that things will be up
and running in... What was that?

01:03.277 --> 01:05.183
An unidentified object
just struck the City.

01:05.303 --> 01:08.780
- Why didn't the sensors pick it up?
- I don't know, it came in so fast.

01:09.054 --> 01:11.090
We're getting
a low-level energy signature.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.343
- What could it be?
- Let's find out.

01:30.614 --> 01:32.317
- Any injuries?
- No, Sir.

01:32.724 --> 01:36.522
Thank God it hit the reading library or
somebody really could have gotten hurt.

01:36.862 --> 01:37.844
What is it?

01:38.283 --> 01:41.259
It's obviously some kind
of mobile self-contained unit

01:41.379 --> 01:44.274
a drone, possibly a probe.
It's definitely not wraith design.

01:44.528 --> 01:45.741
Perhaps it's Lantean,

01:45.861 --> 01:49.126
you know? A de-orbited satellite
or a device on a recall directive.

01:49.258 --> 01:51.826
Maybe. It's still emanating
a trace energy field.

01:51.962 --> 01:54.955
- Is it dangerous?
- No, it's just interesting.

01:58.544 --> 01:59.547
Check that out.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.597
<i>It was damaged on re-entry. So what?</i>

02:01.720 --> 02:03.750
Re-entry wouldn't have caused that.

02:04.038 --> 02:06.545
Looks like weapons fire.
Maybe it took a hit before it came down.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.473
And yet it came out in one piece.

02:10.596 --> 02:12.202
Tough little bastard!

02:13.175 --> 02:15.210
Colonel.
Do we know what it is yet?

02:15.508 --> 02:16.968
Looks like a probe of some kind.

02:17.088 --> 02:19.487
- Any idea who sent it?
- McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.443
In the meantime,
who's working on the Gate?

02:21.563 --> 02:23.379
The Gate can wait.
This is more important.

02:23.499 --> 02:25.936
With all due respect, sir,
I think they're equally important.

02:26.059 --> 02:29.026
Wouldn't it make more sense to keep
Zelenka working on this mystery object

02:29.146 --> 02:31.234
and move McKay back
to his Gate diagnostics?

02:31.427 --> 02:33.550
It's already been over a week now.

02:34.084 --> 02:36.501
Not being able to use the Gate
is an inconvenience.

02:36.621 --> 02:40.237
The possibility that someone may have
pinpointed our location is a threat.

02:40.357 --> 02:42.391
The threat gets the priority.

02:43.879 --> 02:44.862
Yes, Sir.

02:57.672 --> 02:59.198
<i>This is pointless.</i>

03:00.171 --> 03:02.567
Even though the object survived re-entry
physically intact,

03:02.687 --> 03:04.076
its internal systems are shot.

03:04.196 --> 03:06.081
<i>These are just
incomprehensible readings.</i>

03:06.201 --> 03:07.011
By design.

03:07.923 --> 03:10.055
There's no design here,
Rodney, just meaningless data.

03:10.235 --> 03:12.919
But my instincts tell me that's because
they're running an advanced masking

03:13.039 --> 03:14.431
program, to fool us.

03:14.692 --> 03:17.209
- They're good, I'm better.
- Who's "they", Rodney?

03:17.329 --> 03:18.259
Just...

03:18.930 --> 03:21.387
do me a favour.
Re-launch your decryp sweep.

03:22.163 --> 03:23.163
Humour me.

03:24.761 --> 03:25.630
Fine.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.229
We don't have to stand waiting
for the results. Could take hours.

03:32.365 --> 03:34.628
- Why don't we go back to the Gate?
- Hang on.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.259
It's working. I'm getting something.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.313
Hey, don't touch anything!

03:48.531 --> 03:50.816
- What happened? What did you do?
- Nothing!

03:50.978 --> 03:52.797
- Told you not to touch anything!
- I didn't!

03:52.917 --> 03:55.831
- The program must have crashed.
- You lost all the data!

03:56.874 --> 03:58.979
- What did you see, Rodney?
- Nanite code.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.128
It's the Replicators. They've found us.

05:10.248 --> 05:11.142
Are you sure?

05:11.262 --> 05:13.006
The drone we recovered
contained nanites.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.949
You cannot be certain of that. The
program went down before we had a chance

05:16.069 --> 05:18.440
- to retrieve any significant data.
- I know what I saw.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.833
It was nanite code a
split second before the system crashed.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.640
- I saw nothing.
- You weren't looking.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.715
Our laptops were retrieving
the same data stream.

05:24.835 --> 05:26.668
If there had been anything,
I'd have seen it.

05:26.788 --> 05:31.025
Obviously you didn't, otherwise we would
not be having this dis... Another one!

05:31.206 --> 05:33.447
- <i>Colonel Sheppard. Major Lorne here.</i>
- Go ahead, Major.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.672
<i>There's been an explosion in Dr. McKay's
lab. I suggest you get down here.</i>

05:44.086 --> 05:45.258
What the...

05:46.531 --> 05:47.892
What happened?

05:48.975 --> 05:49.758
Well,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.193
either your sandwich exploded

05:52.313 --> 05:55.843
or that mystery drone
had a built-in self-destruct protocol.

05:56.150 --> 05:59.155
We must have inadvertently initiated it
when we ran our analysis.

05:59.356 --> 06:00.361
Sorry, Doc.

06:00.938 --> 06:02.847
At least you weren't around
when it went off.

06:05.383 --> 06:06.326
Lucky us!

06:10.753 --> 06:12.336
Something's not right.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.117
That diagnostic program
should never have crashed.

06:15.237 --> 06:18.098
It's perfectly capable of handling
any of the data coming from the probe.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.854
then before we get a chance to get it
up and running again, what happens?

06:20.974 --> 06:22.290
The probe gets destroyed.

06:22.410 --> 06:25.324
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. I just

06:25.589 --> 06:29.047
it feels like someone or something
is working very hard to get in my way.

06:29.186 --> 06:31.690
And yes, I know
what that sounds like. Just

06:32.010 --> 06:34.186
do me a favour: keep an eye out, OK?

06:44.422 --> 06:46.048
Think he's imagining it?

06:48.007 --> 06:49.594
Maybe he needs a vacation.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.641
I guess you disagree, huh?

06:56.010 --> 06:58.879
I don't know. Just seems like people
are acting different lately.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.578
- Different?
- I don't know how to explain it.

07:02.698 --> 07:05.123
They just haven't been themselves.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.819
Teyla's noticed it too.

07:15.100 --> 07:15.901
Well,

07:16.514 --> 07:18.318
maybe everyone's getting a little

07:18.438 --> 07:21.230
stir crazy not being able
to get offworld. You know,

07:21.350 --> 07:22.555
acting a little

07:22.894 --> 07:25.155
- weird, getting a little paranoid.
- I'm not paranoid.

07:27.377 --> 07:29.243
People have been acting weird lately.

07:39.446 --> 07:41.588
You make a compelling argument!

07:42.099 --> 07:44.131
I think you're gonna need stitches.

07:48.061 --> 07:48.809
Here.

07:52.829 --> 07:53.599
Sorry.

07:59.641 --> 08:00.574
What happened?

08:00.694 --> 08:03.397
Well, Ronon decided to knock
some sense into me.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.758
Well, let me take a look.

08:12.647 --> 08:13.718
You're fine.

08:14.948 --> 08:16.019
No stitches?

08:16.391 --> 08:17.960
No. Not even a Band-Aid.

08:18.951 --> 08:20.417
There's nothing there.

08:22.699 --> 08:24.054
Well, I'm bleeding.

08:24.617 --> 08:27.713
Well, not from any head wound.
It was probably Ronon's blood.

08:28.683 --> 08:29.413
No.

08:30.549 --> 08:32.655
He hit me. I was bleeding.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.352
Run a scan on me.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.053
- A scan?
- If McKay's right

08:40.173 --> 08:43.347
and there are nanites in that probe,
there's a good chance I got infected.

08:45.998 --> 08:46.730
OK.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.376
Hold still.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.523
No nanites.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.528
You're clean.

09:17.261 --> 09:18.596
- Run a blood test.
- John,

09:18.716 --> 09:20.979
- if you were infected with nanites...
- Forget the nanites.

09:21.099 --> 09:25.051
Something like this happened to me
before. I got infected with a retrovirus

09:25.171 --> 09:28.570
- and I was able to heal right away.
- I'm sure that's not the case now,

09:28.732 --> 09:32.153
- since you haven't been exposed...
- Maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.

09:32.297 --> 09:35.118
- I seriously doubt...
- Just run a blood test.

09:39.995 --> 09:40.759
Okay.

09:51.501 --> 09:54.610
<i>I thought the problem was dealt with.
I destroyed the drone.</i>

09:55.186 --> 09:57.550
<i>You made them suspicious in the process.</i>

09:58.199 --> 10:00.034
So what do you suggest we do?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.312
They're still a long way
from knowing the truth.

10:04.789 --> 10:06.183
For now, we just

10:06.303 --> 10:07.842
need to be careful.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.295
Colonel. I got your test results back.

10:16.453 --> 10:19.030
I'm pleased to tell you
you're one hundred percent bug-free.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.551
No sign of the retrovirus
in your system.

10:23.532 --> 10:25.974
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

10:26.935 --> 10:30.076
All that says is my blood's clean.
Doesn't explain the magical head wound.

10:30.224 --> 10:33.244
Maybe it doesn't make sense because
you're refusing to consider the only

10:33.364 --> 10:36.978
possible explanation for what happened.
You made a mistake.

10:39.224 --> 10:41.689
Ronon wasn't bleeding.
I checked.

10:42.443 --> 10:44.461
Well, maybe the blood
was already on the towel

10:44.663 --> 10:47.020
and you mistakenly
transferred it to your forehead.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.384
Ronon saw the cut.

10:48.504 --> 10:51.048
He was the one
who said I needed stitches.

10:51.372 --> 10:53.162
Unless he was wrong too.

10:55.671 --> 10:57.876
All right. Well,
I'll run your blood work again and

10:57.996 --> 11:00.820
if I still can't find anything,
we'll do a complete physical.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:17.048 --> 11:19.206
What are you all doing here?
What's going on?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.940
I'll be right back. I just remembered I
forgot to unplug something, or plug...

11:26.071 --> 11:29.232
- Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- This may hurt a little.

11:29.394 --> 11:31.554
What?! No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

11:36.008 --> 11:37.875
- What is the matter with you?
- Here.

11:37.995 --> 11:40.380
I'm gonna need more than that,
disinfectant and some stitches...

11:40.516 --> 11:41.986
Shut up and hold on a second.

11:44.069 --> 11:45.046
All right.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.808
Let's take a look.

11:51.746 --> 11:54.629
It's gone!
That's impossible! How could it...

11:54.749 --> 11:56.758
That's the reaction we were hoping for.

11:56.994 --> 12:00.872
If it's any consolation, I can assure
you we all underwent the same test.

12:01.003 --> 12:03.441
Test? What test?
What the hell's going on here?

12:03.561 --> 12:05.077
That's what we'd like to find out.

12:05.197 --> 12:07.659
Rodney, you're not the only one
who's noticed the strange behaviour

12:07.779 --> 12:09.576
of many of the people on this base.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.994
<i>They've been acting
unusually withdrawn, even secretive.</i>

12:13.134 --> 12:13.977
Yeah.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.535
I wasn't sure what to make of it.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.622
At first, I was ready to dismiss
Zelenka's screw-up as just gross

12:19.742 --> 12:23.757
incompetence, but I thought
it didn't make sense, even for him.

12:23.881 --> 12:26.002
No, no, that was no accident.

12:26.238 --> 12:28.635
I mean, he crashed
that diagnostic system on purpose.

12:28.755 --> 12:31.282
I'm assuming what happened
with that drone was no accident either.

12:31.474 --> 12:33.824
What does this have to do
with my super-healing abilities?

12:33.944 --> 12:36.110
Last night Ronon clubbed me in the head.

12:36.236 --> 12:37.412
By accident...

12:37.648 --> 12:39.431
- sort of.
<i>- I was cut.</i>

12:39.551 --> 12:41.562
I went to the Infirmary to have
Keller check it out

12:41.682 --> 12:43.852
by the time I got there
it was completely healed.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.595
But the last time that happened,
it was the, it was the retrovirus.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.816
That's what I thought,
so I had her run a blood test.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.708
- And?
- She says she didn't find anything.

12:51.050 --> 12:53.913
- What, you think she's lying?
- I don't know, but we gotta find out.

12:54.033 --> 12:56.506
Well, I can access the Infirmary's
database from here. Just...

13:04.444 --> 13:05.953
OK, I'm in.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.534
Now...

13:08.427 --> 13:09.303
And...

13:12.461 --> 13:13.168
What?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.256
There's no record of any blood test. If
she did, she didn't enter the results.

13:16.543 --> 13:17.988
She did a full body scan too.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.778
- Well, there's nothing here.
<i>- That's impossible.</i>

13:20.964 --> 13:23.072
The scanner is wired directly
into the computer.

13:23.192 --> 13:25.969
- Results are recorded automatically.
- It doesn't mean they can't be erased.

13:26.089 --> 13:29.633
All right. We need to run our own tests.
Until we figure out what's going on,

13:29.753 --> 13:31.777
we can't risk trusting anyone
outside this room.

13:32.184 --> 13:34.842
We have to get to the infirmary
without anyone knowing.

13:37.165 --> 13:38.474
I have an idea.

13:41.474 --> 13:43.018
How's it goin', Rodney?

13:43.459 --> 13:46.086
<i>I've patched into the life signs
detector, but there's a problem.</i>

13:46.206 --> 13:47.417
What problem?

13:47.627 --> 13:50.259
Just... I'm not sure.
Just hold on a minute.

13:51.013 --> 13:54.169
- Looks like it's working fine to me.
- Right! Thank you for your input.

13:55.081 --> 13:56.599
Is the infirmary clear?

13:57.048 --> 13:57.938
Hold on.

13:59.441 --> 14:00.184
Rodney!

14:00.446 --> 14:03.266
This is bizarre. I can't get it
to give me a live feed. It's like

14:03.386 --> 14:04.554
it's stuck in a loop.

14:04.907 --> 14:05.910
Well, fix it!

14:11.844 --> 14:13.266
All right, I got it.

14:20.572 --> 14:21.806
What the hell?!

14:21.955 --> 14:23.114
Oh, now you broke it.

14:23.303 --> 14:25.440
I didn't break it!
It's working fine!

14:25.711 --> 14:27.230
Is the infirmary clear or not?

14:27.350 --> 14:29.815
Yeah, the infirmary,
the corridors, the surrounding towers.

14:29.938 --> 14:32.035
According to this,
we're the only people on the base!

14:32.155 --> 14:34.666
- How's that possible?
- <i>Off-hand, I would say it's not,</i>

14:34.786 --> 14:37.097
<i>but right now
I am reading four life signs.</i>

14:40.303 --> 14:41.639
Let's keep moving.

14:49.752 --> 14:51.024
We have a problem.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.865
All right. Let's make this quick.

15:06.938 --> 15:08.301
I've got something.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.092
It's another life sign.
It's the outer edge of the City.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.306
Let's check it out. Come on.

15:17.407 --> 15:18.488
Maybe we should...

15:18.608 --> 15:19.608
<i>Come on!</i>

15:27.553 --> 15:29.401
What the hell?

15:33.282 --> 15:34.185
Nanites!

15:57.444 --> 15:59.505
There's supposed to be a room here.

16:06.344 --> 16:07.798
There is a room here.

16:09.066 --> 16:09.871
Wait.

16:28.756 --> 16:29.780
Easy, easy.

16:31.581 --> 16:33.012
How did you get here?

16:35.116 --> 16:37.394
- I don't know.
<i>- I can answer that.</i>

16:39.053 --> 16:40.737
This is where we made her.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.461
This is where we made you all.

16:48.970 --> 16:51.309
This explains why
we can heal so rapidly.

16:51.873 --> 16:54.714
We get injured
and the nanites effect repairs.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.231
- We'd better tell the others.
- Yes.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.788
That won't be necessary.

17:01.094 --> 17:02.360
What the hell's going on?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.771
I'm sorry, Colonel.

17:03.894 --> 17:05.692
You're gonna have to come with us.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.647
I don't think so.

17:10.501 --> 17:12.212
That won't do you any good.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.827
I'm warning you, Major. Stand down.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.275
Go ahead. Shoot.

17:24.792 --> 17:25.792
You see?

17:28.605 --> 17:29.798
You're Replicators.

17:29.928 --> 17:30.999
That's right.

17:31.541 --> 17:34.351
Until you began making
changes to our base code,

17:34.479 --> 17:37.717
we were forbidden from assuming
the form of any living human,

17:37.995 --> 17:40.127
but now we can take any form we like.

17:51.574 --> 17:54.300
You couldn't have replaced
everyone on the base. It's impossible!

17:54.420 --> 17:57.315
Only because you believe
this is the real Atlantis,

17:57.435 --> 17:59.418
and that you're the real Doctor McKay.

18:05.039 --> 18:07.678
So you're saying that
we're also Replicators?

18:07.997 --> 18:08.699
No.

18:09.873 --> 18:11.296
You are flesh and blood

18:11.420 --> 18:12.927
<i>ordinary humans in every way</i>

18:13.089 --> 18:16.139
<i>except that you were manufactured
from the inside out by nanites,</i>

18:16.426 --> 18:19.376
some of which remain in your system,
effecting repairs as necessary.

18:19.496 --> 18:20.586
I'm not buying it.

18:20.814 --> 18:22.019
<i>All that you are</i>

18:22.444 --> 18:24.179
your thoughts, your memories

18:24.344 --> 18:26.393
everything was taken
from the real John Sheppard

18:26.513 --> 18:29.485
and his team when their minds
were probed over a year ago.

18:31.553 --> 18:33.566
See, now I know you're lying,
because

18:33.686 --> 18:36.700
a year ago Carson Beckett was
our Chief of Medicine, not Dr. Keller.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.171
she hadn't even arrived yet.

18:38.307 --> 18:40.228
This scenario was
updated with information

18:40.348 --> 18:42.260
obtained from the last member
of your expedition

18:42.380 --> 18:43.875
to be captured by the Replicators.

18:47.465 --> 18:48.532
Elizabeth Weir.

19:00.714 --> 19:02.130
You sure about this?

19:02.990 --> 19:04.597
I need to see for myself.

19:27.575 --> 19:28.575
Oh my God.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.667
All right.
We're all infected by nanites.

19:30.787 --> 19:32.548
Not infected with, constructed by.

19:32.710 --> 19:34.807
- I don't believe it.
- I know it's tough to swallow.

19:34.927 --> 19:37.348
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my head around it myself, but

19:37.468 --> 19:39.456
- it would explain a couple of things.
- Such as?

19:39.576 --> 19:41.424
Such as why the Gate's not working,
for one.

19:41.544 --> 19:44.213
If none of this is real, if this is all
just a lab rat experiment,

19:44.349 --> 19:46.402
then it stands to reason
the Gate's not real either.

19:46.543 --> 19:48.092
If this is not the real Atlantis,

19:48.219 --> 19:50.528
you of all people would have noticed.
The stars alone...

19:50.648 --> 19:53.358
The whole time the Gate's been down,
it has been solid overcast.

19:53.478 --> 19:55.205
That's over a week now.
Think about it:

19:55.325 --> 19:57.572
when was the last time
any of you saw stars?

20:16.930 --> 20:18.362
That's what you named me.

20:18.561 --> 20:21.064
<i>There's no point in
calling you anything else.</i>

20:21.597 --> 20:23.599
You're exactly like her in every way.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.503
Except that I'm not her.

20:27.906 --> 20:28.626
No.

20:30.323 --> 20:33.276
The real Elizabeth Weir
was killed several months ago.

20:35.266 --> 20:38.033
<i>Part of her brain
had been replaced by nanites.</i>

20:38.931 --> 20:40.875
It was done to save her life but

20:41.677 --> 20:43.163
it made her dangerous.

20:44.315 --> 20:46.641
<i>Whenever she linked
with other Replicators,</i>

20:46.761 --> 20:50.084
<i>the human part of her exerted
an unhealthy influence</i>

20:50.956 --> 20:53.004
at least, that's the way Oberoth saw it.

20:53.361 --> 20:54.505
But you don't agree?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.980
Why do you think we did all this?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.747
Your humanity is what
we're interested in.

21:03.494 --> 21:06.990
Because the Ancients created us
with one fatal flaw.

21:07.116 --> 21:08.491
You can't ascend.

21:09.537 --> 21:11.572
That's what you're after, isn't it?

21:12.747 --> 21:15.318
All right, I know this is a lot
for everyone to deal with,

21:15.438 --> 21:17.197
but we're just gonna have to...

21:17.352 --> 21:18.580
suck it up and

21:19.124 --> 21:21.545
- re-focus.
- Re-focus on what?

21:21.787 --> 21:23.873
- Getting the hell out of here.
- So we can go where?

21:23.993 --> 21:27.010
Back to Atlantis to resume our lives?
Yeah, I forgot, they're not ours.

21:27.132 --> 21:29.287
- Says them.
- There's no point in denying the facts.

21:29.407 --> 21:31.730
They were telling the truth.
We're not who we thought we were.

21:31.867 --> 21:33.600
Well, I may not be the original, but

21:33.720 --> 21:37.055
you're gonna have a hard time convincing
me that I'm not pretty damned close.

21:37.175 --> 21:39.412
Our origins do not make us
any less human,

21:39.532 --> 21:41.269
not physically
and certainly not mentally.

21:41.389 --> 21:42.966
Not while we can think for ourselves.

21:43.086 --> 21:46.342
And in my heart there is no doubt,
we must return to Atlantis.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.253
OK.

21:47.837 --> 21:50.019
We'll go back,
take things from there.

21:50.885 --> 21:54.008
Great! We're all in agreement,
we're gettin' out of here.

21:54.128 --> 21:56.639
Now, all we have to do
is figure out how!

21:59.672 --> 22:01.044
You're part of Niam's group.

22:01.181 --> 22:02.898
Most were reprogrammed, but

22:03.018 --> 22:05.612
some of us managed to stay hidden
within the collective.

22:06.194 --> 22:09.856
You think by studying us,
you'll discover the secret ingredient?

22:10.018 --> 22:11.597
You're all fully human.

22:12.719 --> 22:16.035
You have the same minds as your
original selves, the same thoughts,

22:16.289 --> 22:17.693
the same emotions.

22:19.149 --> 22:21.956
More importantly, you have
something that's always eluded us,

22:23.148 --> 22:26.026
something that kept your kind
apart from the very beginning and

22:26.219 --> 22:28.710
made you special
in the eyes of our creators.

22:29.517 --> 22:31.131
You would call it a soul.

22:32.377 --> 22:35.008
It is that "secret ingredient"
you referred to,

22:37.499 --> 22:38.674
the key to ascension.

22:39.718 --> 22:43.700
That is not something you can learn
to acquire simply by studying us.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.247
Why not?

22:46.411 --> 22:48.953
The human brain is just
an electro-chemical machine,

22:50.130 --> 22:51.796
biologically created, but

22:51.945 --> 22:53.735
a machine nonetheless.

22:54.612 --> 22:56.198
Everything is quantifiable.

22:56.410 --> 22:57.831
Now you sound like Oberoth.

23:00.190 --> 23:02.298
The others have given up on ascension.

23:03.848 --> 23:06.006
They're destroying
human populations throughout

23:06.174 --> 23:09.050
the galaxy as a tactic
in their war with the Wraith.

23:09.549 --> 23:12.321
They're consumed
with hatred and revenge.

23:15.356 --> 23:16.938
We believe there is another path.

23:17.093 --> 23:18.882
Why are you telling me all this?

23:20.127 --> 23:21.619
You're open-minded,

23:23.013 --> 23:24.989
and it's important that we gauge your
reactions.

23:25.279 --> 23:25.990
Why?

23:26.793 --> 23:29.460
So we can avoid
the same mistakes next time.

23:35.337 --> 23:38.863
They're gonna wipe our memories
and then start again on another planet.

23:40.021 --> 23:42.832
That probe was sent by Oberoth
and the other Replicators.

23:42.952 --> 23:44.490
Our friends  tried to destroy it,

23:44.610 --> 23:47.480
- but they only managed to disable it.
- If it hadn't crashed into the City,

23:47.630 --> 23:50.056
- who knows how long it'd have gone on?
- Yeah, but the point is,

23:50.176 --> 23:51.626
this position's been compromised.

23:51.748 --> 23:54.485
Once the other Replicators find
this city, they'll destroy it.

23:54.853 --> 23:56.467
Oh, yeah, and us too.

23:56.660 --> 23:59.047
Is that any worse
than having our memories erased

23:59.167 --> 24:01.046
and starting this whole process again?

24:02.104 --> 24:03.736
We've gotta find a way out of here.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.027
I'm sorry it's come to this.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.931
Listen to me.

24:13.066 --> 24:14.371
You have probed our minds.

24:14.491 --> 24:16.760
You know everything
there is to know about us.

24:16.894 --> 24:19.002
You should know,
we will never accept this.

24:19.317 --> 24:22.297
No matter how many times you wipe our
memories, we'll always figure it out.

24:22.459 --> 24:25.663
She's right. We're genetically
pre-disposed to being...

24:25.817 --> 24:27.677
stubborn, really pesky.

24:28.299 --> 24:31.379
You want to understand
what it means to be human, right?

24:32.375 --> 24:35.893
You wanna know what qualities
might eventually lead to ascension?

24:37.278 --> 24:39.105
You can start with compassion.

24:40.683 --> 24:42.818
I understand what you're saying,

24:43.664 --> 24:47.337
and under different circumstances
I might even agree with you.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.933
Unfortunately, it's too late.

24:51.203 --> 24:52.493
What are you talking about?

24:53.606 --> 24:55.622
The other Replicators have found us.

25:06.878 --> 25:08.725
They failed to break down
our mental defences

25:08.898 --> 25:12.430
and bring us back into the collective,
so now they want to destroy us.

25:12.592 --> 25:14.552
Well, you have to raise the shield!

25:14.724 --> 25:15.859
We can't.

25:16.532 --> 25:19.089
Your creation required too much power

25:19.608 --> 25:21.471
and we couldn't get
our hands on multiple ZPMs

25:21.591 --> 25:23.570
without drawing too much attention.

25:25.031 --> 25:26.166
Let us out.

25:27.301 --> 25:30.239
Your fellow Replicators
are targeting human worlds.

25:31.109 --> 25:33.763
<i>They are murdering thousands
of innocent people.</i>

25:33.898 --> 25:36.120
<i>If you are serious about
following the footsteps</i>

25:36.398 --> 25:39.415
of your creators, you will
let us go so we can stop this.

25:40.552 --> 25:42.263
Oberoth is too powerful.

25:42.436 --> 25:44.170
<i>If this city falls</i>

25:44.332 --> 25:46.664
and we're destroyed with it,
this will be nothing more

25:46.784 --> 25:49.186
than a wasted opportunity

25:50.051 --> 25:51.594
a failed experiment.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.878
<i>You know what that feels like.</i>

25:56.782 --> 25:59.301
That's what the Ancients considered us

26:00.397 --> 26:01.688
failed experiments.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.148
Well, now's your chance
to prove 'em wrong.

26:04.551 --> 26:08.609
All we are asking is that you give us
a chance to make a difference.

26:37.039 --> 26:38.057
Take this.

26:38.219 --> 26:39.088
What's this?

26:39.259 --> 26:41.394
It's the core drive
of a ship's tracking system.

26:41.853 --> 26:44.556
With this, you should be able
to pinpoint the locations and movements

26:44.676 --> 26:47.358
of every one of Oberoth's
Aurora-class vessels in this galaxy.

26:47.885 --> 26:51.320
Take this to Atlantis... it will be
their best chance of stopping Oberoth.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.614
Go up to the Bay... take a Jumper.

26:55.894 --> 26:56.996
Come with us.

26:57.464 --> 27:00.214
I can't.
Oberoth might be able to track me.

27:00.522 --> 27:02.749
I'll only be a liability.

27:03.002 --> 27:03.724
Go.

27:29.330 --> 27:30.445
That's it.

27:31.868 --> 27:33.292
The city's gone.

27:36.541 --> 27:37.733
So now what?

27:38.927 --> 27:39.735
<i>Well,</i>

27:40.716 --> 27:42.100
we're already cloaked.

27:42.273 --> 27:45.467
All we need to do is follow
the ship out of the atmosphere

27:45.640 --> 27:48.082
and catch a ride before
it jumps into hyperspace.

27:48.217 --> 27:49.775
"Catch a ride"?

27:49.928 --> 27:50.866
Yeah.

27:51.347 --> 27:52.590
Watch.

28:05.733 --> 28:07.375
Re-appoint drive pods.

28:11.414 --> 28:13.260
Nice and snug.

28:41.663 --> 28:44.547
- You doing OK?
- Sure, all things considered.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.811
Not bad for a dead woman.

28:47.931 --> 28:49.566
Everything'll be fine.

28:49.824 --> 28:52.023
My guess is we're headed back
to the replicator homeworld.

28:52.143 --> 28:54.277
Once we get there,
we can find a ship with a hyperdrive.

28:55.629 --> 28:56.798
And go where?

28:57.029 --> 28:59.365
Well, obviously
we can't fly straight back to Atlantis.

28:59.519 --> 29:03.119
They'd probably take us out before
we had a chance to explain but

29:03.680 --> 29:05.293
maybe New Athos.

29:05.417 --> 29:07.331
We can contact them once we get there.

29:07.493 --> 29:08.916
And then what?

29:09.986 --> 29:12.712
<i>How do you think the real Sheppard's
gonna react when he sees you?</i>

29:13.817 --> 29:15.256
How would you react?

29:19.323 --> 29:20.801
In a way, I'm lucky.

29:20.924 --> 29:23.431
At least I know I'm the only
Elizabeth Weir out there.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.192
<i>You were right.</i>

29:35.521 --> 29:39.068
It's the replicator homeworld.
Looks like they've been busy.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.257
What do you mean?

29:41.925 --> 29:44.535
Remember those shipyards we destroyed?
That's one of them.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.309
They rebuilt it.

29:46.573 --> 29:48.247
- And then some!
<i>- Good.</i>

29:48.600 --> 29:51.876
Then we should be able to find
a ship they won't miss.

29:56.175 --> 29:59.180
It's a streamlining programme designed
to boost its operating efficiency.

29:59.304 --> 30:02.494
Look, the Gate will be offline for,
what, one hour, two hours tops.

30:06.803 --> 30:09.380
- We expecting someone?
- No, Sir,

30:10.242 --> 30:13.542
but it's Major Jordan
reporting in from M34-227.

30:13.789 --> 30:15.900
- You got video?
- Yes, Sir.

30:18.654 --> 30:21.072
- What's the situation, Major?
- <i>Well, Sir,</i>

30:21.326 --> 30:24.450
<i>there's someone here
who would like to have a word with you.</i>

30:35.125 --> 30:36.352
<i>Hello, John.</i>

30:40.298 --> 30:43.260
Elizabeth! What happened to you?
How did you get away?

30:43.891 --> 30:47.264
<i>I'm not Elizabeth.
Well, not the Elizabeth you knew.</i>

30:49.387 --> 30:52.636
<i>I have all of her memories
and all of her thoughts...</i>

30:53.458 --> 30:55.445
<i>everything that makes her me.</i>

30:56.160 --> 30:57.233
<i>But I'm a duplicate.</i>

30:58.855 --> 31:01.388
<i>I was created
by a faction of the Replicators</i>

31:01.508 --> 31:03.739
<i>as a means to attaining ascension.</i>

31:04.793 --> 31:07.743
But you... look and sound just like her.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.787
<i>I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true.</i>

31:11.029 --> 31:12.837
<i>This group managed to isolate themselves</i>

31:12.990 --> 31:15.433
<i>from the others in order
to pursue their study in secrecy,</i>

31:15.582 --> 31:18.170
<i>but they were eventually
discovered and destroyed.</i>

31:19.735 --> 31:21.543
I... don't know what to say.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.467
This is all very,

31:24.081 --> 31:24.885
<i>Strange?</i>

31:27.811 --> 31:29.119
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

31:29.581 --> 31:31.183
<i>But we need to meet.</i>

31:31.658 --> 31:35.215
<i>We have some information that
you can use against the Replicators.</i>

31:35.446 --> 31:36.331
"We"?

31:51.228 --> 31:53.728
Well, I suppose introductions
aren't really necessary.

31:53.901 --> 31:56.418
Great... Last time I came
face to face with myself,

31:56.538 --> 31:58.516
I ended up kicking my own ass.

32:00.401 --> 32:01.516
<i>Nice jacket!</i>

32:02.535 --> 32:04.478
Yeah, it's new.

32:04.921 --> 32:05.959
We got...

32:06.363 --> 32:08.993
new versions of those uniforms.
The old ones used to...

32:09.113 --> 32:10.824
bunch up under the arms.

32:11.036 --> 32:11.843
Yeah.

32:14.228 --> 32:16.729
- You said you've got something for us.
- <i>Yeah!</i>

32:19.733 --> 32:21.025
No, my McKay.

32:21.867 --> 32:23.194
Oh, yeah, right.

32:30.348 --> 32:31.291
What is that?

32:31.425 --> 32:33.687
This is the core drive
of a replicator ship tracking system.

32:33.841 --> 32:35.810
Once it is up and running,
we'll be able to track

32:35.945 --> 32:38.417
every Aurora-class replicator ship
in the Pegasus galaxy.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.294
It's not much, but it's a start.

32:40.456 --> 32:41.932
Are you kidding?! This is huge!

32:42.066 --> 32:44.006
We can get working
on a modification program...

32:44.168 --> 32:46.586
- reconfigure the sequencing...
- run it through an Ancient relays

32:46.706 --> 32:48.991
so the information's automatically
adapted and outputted.

32:49.127 --> 32:50.971
"Outputted"? Is that even a word?

32:51.514 --> 32:53.516
- Of course it is!
- We can't both be wrong.

32:54.078 --> 32:55.801
Look, we need
to get started on this now.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.324
Not so fast.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.232
Where do you plan on doing this?

32:59.371 --> 33:01.732
We're too big of a security risk
to be allowed back on Atlantis.

33:02.139 --> 33:03.262
He's got a...

33:03.586 --> 33:04.862
I've got a point.

33:04.986 --> 33:07.181
You two are gonna have
to find another way to do that.

33:07.301 --> 33:09.643
Not a problem. I'll just go back
to Atlantis, get what we need.

33:09.777 --> 33:11.748
- We can do the work here.
- Oh, this is great!

33:11.868 --> 33:13.917
Finally, someone in whom
I can have 100% confidence!

33:14.040 --> 33:15.763
I'm looking forward to working with you!

33:15.883 --> 33:16.943
<i>Just the beginning!</i>

33:17.063 --> 33:20.153
Humanity's about to benefit from one
of the greatest living scientific minds

33:20.273 --> 33:21.201
times two!

33:21.321 --> 33:23.420
- Can you imagine?!
- I'm trying not to.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.242
We appreciate all this,
but the truth is,

33:30.362 --> 33:32.680
we came here for another reason.

33:32.842 --> 33:34.823
You were with the Replicators.

33:35.170 --> 33:37.977
What do you know about our Elizabeth,
are you willing to help us get her back?

33:43.150 --> 33:45.900
You think this other Keller
was telling the truth?

33:47.016 --> 33:48.881
I don't know why she'd lie.

33:50.304 --> 33:51.947
It's kinda weird, that's all.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.169
I mean,

33:53.496 --> 33:57.111
I don't see you for all this time,
then five minutes later I find out...

33:57.889 --> 33:59.216
That I'm dead.

34:00.351 --> 34:01.409
Yeah.

34:02.966 --> 34:05.235
Don't worry...
the moment I learned the truth,

34:05.389 --> 34:08.533
I knew there'd be no going back
the way things were... not for me,

34:08.793 --> 34:10.121
not for any of us.

34:11.797 --> 34:14.342
- I don't like him.
- I know, it's odd.

34:14.496 --> 34:16.420
I know I'm me,
so who the hell's this other guy?

34:16.554 --> 34:17.726
He's you as well.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.304
No, there's only one me.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.918
Apparently not!

34:21.226 --> 34:22.804
He's nothing but a copy, then.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.148
From what I understand,

34:24.397 --> 34:28.378
even though he's not the original,
he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.

34:28.551 --> 34:29.955
I don't like him.

34:33.733 --> 34:35.983
I didn't really believe it...
not until we got out here.

34:36.137 --> 34:37.406
I know.

34:37.599 --> 34:39.618
I was holding out hope as well.

34:39.790 --> 34:42.252
I thought that
the Replicators had captured us

34:42.387 --> 34:44.617
and implanted the nanites
and that they were...

34:44.790 --> 34:47.214
lying to us to keep us
from wanting to return.

34:47.348 --> 34:49.521
Yeah, well, it worked.
I'm not going back with them.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.444
What?

34:51.579 --> 34:52.964
I've been on my own before.

34:53.117 --> 34:55.014
At least, that's how I remember it.

34:55.149 --> 34:57.418
Now I've got these nanites
that'll heal me if I get injured.

34:57.593 --> 35:00.771
You are not invincible.
The nanites can only do so much.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.707
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

35:03.707 --> 35:07.130
I understand your anger
and your disappointment,

35:07.630 --> 35:09.944
but it makes no difference
who came first.

35:10.246 --> 35:12.169
You're as much Ronon as he is.

35:12.342 --> 35:13.186
Oh yeah?

35:13.322 --> 35:16.322
Why's he leading my life on Atlantis
while I'm treated like an outsider?

35:17.438 --> 35:19.611
Their circumstances are different.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.977
You mean we make them
feel uncomfortable,

35:22.131 --> 35:24.439
so they'd rather not have us around.

35:25.304 --> 35:28.684
Given our origins,
they see us as a potential threat.

35:28.804 --> 35:30.323
Can you blame them?

35:31.957 --> 35:33.246
I guess not.

35:33.515 --> 35:34.969
I'd probably do the same.

35:35.765 --> 35:37.763
Still, it doesn't change the...

35:44.877 --> 35:47.916
- We'll go back to the camp.
- We'll go find Sheppard and Weir.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.762
It's not like
this hasn't happened before.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.818
The other Elizabeth got infected
by those little nanite things

35:59.938 --> 36:02.839
and we figured out how to
stop them somehow.

36:03.455 --> 36:05.582
Maybe we can do the same for you.

36:06.916 --> 36:09.397
So we wouldn't be a security threat?

36:10.416 --> 36:11.916
You can contribute.

36:12.396 --> 36:13.858
Things'll just be...

36:14.242 --> 36:15.281
different.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.639
That's not really the issue, John.

36:21.127 --> 36:23.377
I guess what really bothers me

36:24.128 --> 36:25.762
is just knowing that you and the others

36:25.897 --> 36:28.272
will always consider me less
than what I really am.

36:30.819 --> 36:33.235
- That's not true.
- Of course it is...

36:33.973 --> 36:35.279
and I don't blame you.

36:37.798 --> 36:39.700
D'you hear something?

36:47.029 --> 36:49.510
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Please respond.</i>

36:49.664 --> 36:51.128
Go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?

36:51.290 --> 36:52.512
The Replicators are here.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.331
They managed to track the ship.

36:57.847 --> 37:00.647
- <i>John, do you hear me?</i>
- Oh, yeah, I heard you.

37:07.973 --> 37:10.814
<i>Our ship must have had
a hidden sub-space transponder.</i>

37:11.134 --> 37:13.083
All right, run.

37:23.590 --> 37:24.817
What was that?

37:28.244 --> 37:30.687
- That way. Come on.
- Ronon, wait!

37:38.054 --> 37:40.676
- Where's McKay?
- He's still at the compound.

37:40.869 --> 37:43.972
Rodney, this is Sheppard. We need you
to fall back to the Gate immediately.

37:44.165 --> 37:47.267
<i>Colonel, this is Major Jordan.
The Gate is a no-go.</i>

37:47.429 --> 37:48.977
<i>I repeat, the Gate is a no-go.</i>

37:49.139 --> 37:50.813
<i>There's a replicator ship in position</i>

37:50.975 --> 37:53.148
<i>ready to take us out the second
we show ourselves.</i>

37:53.444 --> 37:55.276
All right, everybody
fall back to the Jumper.

37:55.412 --> 37:56.944
- Rodney, did you hear me?
- <i>Yeah,</i>

37:57.106 --> 37:58.654
<i>I heard you. We're on our way.</i>

37:59.683 --> 38:01.740
Regarding the Gate:
they have us trapped.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.535
Even cloaked, if the Jumper
so much as rustles a bush,

38:04.697 --> 38:07.454
they will pinpoint our position
and blast us out of the sky.

38:07.623 --> 38:09.456
We need a diversion.

38:17.368 --> 38:20.092
- What happened?
- <i>It's the Replicators. Let's go.</i>

38:21.111 --> 38:22.761
We'll all have a better chance this way.

38:22.923 --> 38:25.764
I don't want you doing this
because you feel any less,

38:26.245 --> 38:27.265
human?

38:28.637 --> 38:30.842
From the beginning we've been
trying to convince ourselves

38:30.996 --> 38:32.650
that we're just like you.

38:33.534 --> 38:35.630
Now we've got a chance to prove it.

38:35.996 --> 38:36.996
All right.

38:37.669 --> 38:38.444
Let's go.

39:45.363 --> 39:46.267
Yeah.

39:46.767 --> 39:48.036
We tricked you,

39:48.690 --> 39:51.975
but don't feel so bad. After all,
we almost had ourselves convinced.

39:58.652 --> 39:59.863
Shut it down!

40:02.113 --> 40:03.748
No-one else is coming.

40:09.553 --> 40:11.264
Shall we take a break?

40:11.687 --> 40:12.918
You go ahead.

40:13.303 --> 40:15.918
Oh, Rodney, we've been working
for five hours straight.

40:16.072 --> 40:19.053
- We should take a break.
- Yeah, I will... when I'm finished.

40:22.167 --> 40:25.167
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Yeah, what's that?

40:26.821 --> 40:29.648
Lose yourself in your work
to avoid thinking about Elizabeth.

40:30.975 --> 40:33.687
You must realise
it's only a temporary distraction.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.709
That's one of the perks of the job.
Something terrible happens,

40:36.832 --> 40:39.574
you don't have time to dwell on it...
you're too busy trying to stop the next

40:39.694 --> 40:41.191
terrible thing from happening.

40:42.217 --> 40:45.563
Seriously, if it wasn't
for the Replicators and their

40:45.736 --> 40:47.890
plan to wipe out
every human in the galaxy,

40:48.044 --> 40:50.159
I'd be in pretty bad shape right now.

40:51.065 --> 40:53.704
Now, this is Carson all over again
and I'm just not ready to deal.

40:54.776 --> 40:55.719
Not yet.

40:58.007 --> 41:00.680
You're not the only one who misses him,
Rodney.

41:03.392 --> 41:06.216
- Don't suppose you wanna talk about it.
- Eventually, but not now.

41:11.429 --> 41:13.583
- Shall I get you anything?
- No.

41:18.814 --> 41:19.930
Thank you.

41:21.776 --> 41:23.468
You're welcome, Rodney.

41:45.526 --> 41:47.424
- How's it going?
- It's all right.

41:49.526 --> 41:53.006
- Why don't you call it a night?
- No, I wanna finish this.

41:53.506 --> 41:55.353
What about you...
isn't it past your bedtime?

41:55.487 --> 41:58.276
I'll approve the removal
of her personal items tomorrow...

41:59.685 --> 42:01.730
have everything shipped back to Earth.

42:03.108 --> 42:06.031
I would have done it sooner,
but I actually thought we were gonna

42:06.261 --> 42:07.277
bring her back.

42:08.032 --> 42:08.935
Yeah.

42:10.185 --> 42:11.166
Me too.

42:13.012 --> 42:15.165
Let me know when
you get this thing working.

42:15.358 --> 42:16.377
Will do.

42:17.299 --> 42:18.434
Oh! Wait!

42:22.127 --> 42:23.394
If this works,

42:23.514 --> 42:26.180
