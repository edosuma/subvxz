01:09.070 --> 01:10.738
<i>They live beneath our streets.</i>

01:11.239 --> 01:13.032
<i>They lurk within the shadows.</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:14.992
<i>They devour innocent victims</i>

01:15.076 --> 01:17.453
<i>causing them to disappear
without a trace.</i>

01:17.703 --> 01:19.914
Who are these scourges of the sewers?

01:20.122 --> 01:23.584
Today, News Byte exposes
the hidden shame of Gotham.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.257
There goes my appetite.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.175
Reality check, Chels.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.344
That's just a load of media hype.
An urban legend.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.180
I don't know, Max,
remember that girl Sally

01:36.264 --> 01:37.390
who disappeared last month?

01:37.473 --> 01:39.100
Maybe giant rats got her.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.270
The only giant rat around here
is Terry McGinnis.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.981
- He blipped you off again?
- Big time.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.314
Dana.

01:47.525 --> 01:50.361
<i>Be advised,
this story contains graphic images...</i>

01:50.444 --> 01:51.862
I've been looking all over for you.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.322
Look somewhere else.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.408
As far as you're concerned,
I'm not here.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.201
Ooh.

01:57.952 --> 01:58.953
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.579
Mr. Wayne needed me again last night.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.748
I don't blame you for being mad.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.626
Mad? Ter, I am way beyond mad.

02:05.710 --> 02:06.711
I've tried to be patient.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.962
And you've been great.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.422
You've always been there for me.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.756
So what do I get in return?

02:11.048 --> 02:12.967
Broken dates, broken promises.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.012
You care more about your dumb job
than you do about me.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.306
Dana, I have responsibilities now.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.016
My mom and brother depend on me.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.099
What do you want?

02:21.350 --> 02:24.186
Someone who occasionally
will be there for me.

02:27.857 --> 02:28.941
Dana, wait.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.901
Uh-uh. Girl time.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.323
Too bad you can't tell Dana
what you've really been doing at night.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.798
"I'll be there for you."

03:09.231 --> 03:10.232
- Got it.
- Got it.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.025
Hello?

03:12.735 --> 03:14.236
It's Dana.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.321
Hey.

03:16.906 --> 03:17.906
Beat it, twip.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.122
Hi. I didn't expect to hear from you.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.541
Flowers can change a girl's mind.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.086
- What?
- We should talk.

03:30.586 --> 03:31.629
Meet me at Rhino's?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.547
<i>Wild jokers couldn't keep me away.</i>

03:33.839 --> 03:36.258
Make sure they don't.
I'll be wearing that dress you like.

03:36.801 --> 03:37.801
Whoa.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.055
<i>Terry and Dana sitting in a tree</i>

03:54.360 --> 03:55.194
Bye, Dad.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.277
Study group tonight?

03:56.487 --> 03:57.696
No. I'm meeting Terry.

03:59.949 --> 04:00.949
Dad.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.869
Dana, I wish
you weren't seeing that boy.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.663
He's been in trouble. He's got a record.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.748
That was a long time ago, Dad.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.125
He's got a job now.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.584
He's really trying to make good.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.586
But you could do so much better.

04:15.673 --> 04:16.673
What's that?

04:24.807 --> 04:25.807
Who's there?

04:34.942 --> 04:35.942
It was nothing.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.320
Are you sure you have to go?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.698
Dad, you worry too much.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.888
Please let it be a wrong number.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.098
<i>Terry, you're needed.</i>

05:06.182 --> 05:07.224
Right now?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.101
I'm on my way to meet Dana.
Can't it wait?

05:09.351 --> 05:11.604
No. Mad Stan's out again.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.357
Great. What's his gripe this time?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.443
Blow it all up!

05:36.629 --> 05:38.506
Keep it down, Stan. We're in a library.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.757
You think this is a joke?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.843
Look around, Batman,
society's crumbling.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.053
And do you know why?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.222
Too many overdue books?

05:46.472 --> 05:48.390
Information overload, man.

05:49.642 --> 05:52.770
As a society, we're drowning
in a quagmire of vid-clips

05:52.853 --> 05:54.605
e-mail, and sound bites.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.065
We can't absorb it all.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.692
There's only one sane solution.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.237
Blow it up.

06:27.846 --> 06:28.973
For this I'm missing a date?

06:39.567 --> 06:42.319
Five minutes.
Okay, I can forgive five minutes.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.043
You're just contributing
to the problem, man.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.808
Playing hero just for another blurb
on the eleven o'clock news.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.394
Be careful, McGinnis.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.730
Once he's on a rant, he's unstoppable.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.148
Thanks for telling me now.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.709
You need a timeout, young man.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.089
Now I'm really mad!

07:48.052 --> 07:49.803
{933931

08:15.371 --> 08:16.622
That's it, McGinnis.

08:16.914 --> 08:17.998
You're dead meat.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.929
"I'll be there for you."

08:35.015 --> 08:36.015
Terry?

08:37.559 --> 08:38.559
Terry?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.254
I must be dreaming.

09:28.861 --> 09:29.861
Who are you?

09:30.154 --> 09:31.154
Where am I?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.865
{933931

09:35.951 --> 09:37.494
No. Stay back.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.746
Don't be scared.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.497
They're my friends.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.587
My name is Patrick. This is my world.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.005
You live here?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.801
I collect things that no one else wants.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.972
See? You might say
I'm kind of a pack rat.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.561
[498898]
- Would you like some jellybeans, Dana?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.813
How do you know my name?

10:05.439 --> 10:06.982
I know everything about you, Dana.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.475
That's why I brought you here.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.824
Dana, if you get this message,
I just wanted to say

10:16.241 --> 10:18.035
I'm a real butthead,
I should've been there,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.888
and I know you probably
never wanna see me again,

10:19.912 --> 10:21.705
but please call.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.293
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your shirt on.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.048
Where is she, McGinnis?
Where's my daughter?

10:31.423 --> 10:32.466
Dana? I don't know.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.229
She was supposed to be
with you last night,

10:34.301 --> 10:35.301
but she never came home.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.511
She didn't?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.639
Mr. Tan, you gotta believe me.
I have no idea...

10:38.722 --> 10:41.266
McGinnis, Iwarned her
you were nothing but trouble.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.103
If anything's happened to her,
I swear, I'll be back.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.072
Come on. Come on.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.365
Fetch.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.121
You've been living underground
all this time? But why?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.332
I told you. They tease me.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.792
They call me Rat Boy.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.125
I didn't like it.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.879
Sometimes friends can be cruel.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.423
I found new friends.
They don't make fun of me.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.885
Come here. I wanna show you something.

11:19.805 --> 11:20.805
Come on.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.237
These hybrids can grow without sunlight.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.697
I developed them myself.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.030
Then it was you?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.617
I saw how unappreciated you were.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.076
I know how that feels.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.788
Patrick, that's sweet, but...

11:45.205 --> 11:47.416
You can't keep me here
like one of your flowers.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.418
I wanna go home.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.795
Dana, you can't go.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.715
I won't let you.
You belong here with me.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.137
I'll get you anything you need.
Just name it.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.765
Well, I am kind of hungry.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.434
Licorice? Turkey jerky?

12:06.852 --> 12:10.063
Actually, I'm kind of in the mood
for Rhino's famous chili.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.191
- Chili?
- It's to die for.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.235
How about we grab a bowl? My treat.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.780
No. I'll get the chili. You stay here.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.325
And don't wander off.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.243
It could be dangerous.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.208
Any word yet?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.171
I rechecked Dana's tel-com
and cash card records.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.340
No activity in the last 24 hours.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.966
<i>It's as if she just vanished.</i>

12:46.016 --> 12:47.656
This is where
she was supposed to meet me.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.354
- Rats!
- Call the health inspector.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
It's disgusting in there.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.983
Uh-oh. New developments.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.364
Big rodent problem.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.932
Hurry. We don't wanna keep Dana waiting.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.557
Dana?

13:37.401 --> 13:38.401
Rats!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.485
<i>You lost them?</i>

13:40.028 --> 13:41.028
Maybe not.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.076
Extra spicy, just the way Dana likes it.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.998
- You're going in?
- I have to.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.667
Stay sharp.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.795
<i>Who knows what else you'll find.</i>

14:12.602 --> 14:13.602
Finally.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.232
<i>Adi√©s, Rat</i> Boy.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.455
Ugh...

17:21.374 --> 17:23.210
I told you not to wander off.

17:32.886 --> 17:33.886
You're not eating.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.137
Guess I'm not hungry.

17:35.972 --> 17:36.806
Are you upset?

17:36.890 --> 17:39.809
What, just because I'm trapped
in the sewers with a headcase

17:39.893 --> 17:42.229
whose idea of a good time
is hanging with rodents?

17:42.562 --> 17:43.730
Why would I be upset?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.196
- You're just like all the others.
- What?

17:51.613 --> 17:53.782
I thought you'd understand,
but you're no different.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.700
You mean you've done this before?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.637
With other kids the world didn't want.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.454
I can see them all from down here.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.706
I took them away from all that
and gave them a home.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
What happened to them?

18:05.210 --> 18:06.753
They don't make fun of me anymore.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.593
Oh, my God.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.056
You shouldn't have made fun of me.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.935
Batman, how did you...

18:22.018 --> 18:23.018
Never mind that.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.186
Stay behind me.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.067
My collection!

18:32.612 --> 18:33.612
Get him.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.411
Get back.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.383
Let's blow this mouse house.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.929
Kill them. Rip them to pieces.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.889
Hold tight.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.066
No!

19:43.892 --> 19:46.353
<i>Amazingly, there were
no reported fatalities.</i>

19:46.436 --> 19:49.105
<i>Authorities are still looking
into the cause of the blast.</i>

19:51.775 --> 19:52.775
Hey there.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.068
Terry?

19:54.736 --> 19:55.945
Better late than never.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.198
If only I'd been there, I could've...

19:58.281 --> 19:59.491
Shut up, McGinnis.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.243
Just shut up.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.625
Come on. Let me take you home.
