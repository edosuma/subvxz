WEBVTT

00:40.791 --> 00:42.084
Angela?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.643
Nicole:
All I'm saying is we
can do this the easy way,

01:41.768 --> 01:44.104
or we can do this
the hard way.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.897
We prefer to do
it the easy way.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.899
Kyle:
I'd take the deal.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.109
It's a win‐win.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.652
Counsel:
My client did nothing wrong.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.238
Therefore, we're
not interested
in your offer.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.240
Client:
Besides, it's crap.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.826
Your client scammed
my client out of
millions of dollars,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.244
and we can prove it.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.079
If you take this deal,

02:01.204 --> 02:03.081
we'll settle for
half the money,

02:03.206 --> 02:05.500
and our client won't
press charges.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.585
Counsel:
Yeah.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.295
That's not gonna happen.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.465
Guess we're doing
this the hard way.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.718
This is an email
from your client
detailing the scam

02:14.843 --> 02:16.637
to his buddy, John.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.971
Could have been doctored.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.348
Nicole:
These are photos
of your client

02:19.473 --> 02:21.558
meeting with his
co‐conspirator, Alex,

02:21.683 --> 02:24.102
who, oh, did I not
mention this part?

02:24.186 --> 02:25.395
Is waiting in the
office upstairs

02:25.479 --> 02:28.148
and has already agreed
to plead guilty to all
charges.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.609
Kyle:
And testify against
your client.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.777
No bid deal.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.237
And finally,
bank statements.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.282
$12 million to the
Cayman Islands.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.283
Okay, okay,
I get it.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.826
I'll take the deal.

02:39.910 --> 02:40.827
The deal?

02:40.911 --> 02:41.995
Oh.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.455
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.667
The deal is no
longer on the table.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.296
Kyle:
We did!

02:51.421 --> 02:52.506
Boom!

02:54.007 --> 02:55.634
You did it
again, Nicole.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.511
My Padawan has
become a Jedi.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.805
I'm proud of you.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.473
Thanks, Obi‐Wan!

03:01.556 --> 03:04.393
You were pretty great,
too, for a wingman.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.477
Ooh!

03:05.560 --> 03:06.520
Ouch.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.730
Well, I'm gonna make sure
Glenn and the other partners

03:08.855 --> 03:10.524
know about your nailing this.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.441
Who knows,

03:11.525 --> 03:12.859
you might just be
the youngest partner

03:12.984 --> 03:14.319
this firm has ever seen.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.321
Well thanks for
always believing.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.656
Kyle:
Of course.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.657
See you.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.700
I'll see you, too.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.785
Joe:
Nicole!

03:25.330 --> 03:27.833
I really didn't think we'd
ever get that money back.

03:27.958 --> 03:28.959
Thank you.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.001
That's what we're here for.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.382
Look, I know it's a long shot,

03:35.507 --> 03:38.468
but we're looking for in
house counsel at the company.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.470
Of course we can't pay you
what they do at the firm,

03:40.554 --> 03:43.598
but I can offer you stock,
great benefits.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.518
I promise never to
call you on a weekend.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.728
What do you think?

03:47.853 --> 03:51.314
I'm flattered, really,
but my path is with the firm.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.692
Maybe talk to me in 10 years?

03:53.817 --> 03:54.776
It was worth a shot.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.278
Always.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.912
Good morning.
‐Good morning.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.790
Morning, Padma.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.833
Morning, Ange.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.422
Hey!

04:15.505 --> 04:17.215
The new strategist
just popped by

04:17.340 --> 04:19.593
and is wondering if he
can come in and say hi.

04:20.844 --> 04:21.720
Oh, yes!

04:21.803 --> 04:23.847
Please, send him in.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.558
Oh, hi!

04:26.683 --> 04:27.893
Hey.
‐Hello!

04:28.018 --> 04:29.102
Michael Langdon.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.729
I wanted to introduce
myself to you in person.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.565
I'm gonna be working with you
on the new Quencher campaign.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.733
Angela:
Oh, I'm‐I'm Angela.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.734
It's a pleasure.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.902
Please, have a seat.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.737
You have a lovely office.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.988
Thank you.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.866
So, where did you come from?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.701
Well I'm originally
from New Orleans,

04:44.785 --> 04:47.287
but I assume you mean my
last company I was at,

04:47.370 --> 04:48.789
Creative Arts Lab.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.749
Oh, that's a great team.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.833
Why'd you leave?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.419
Well, I went to
business school, Stanford.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.004
Angela:
Impressive!

04:56.129 --> 04:57.547
With such a great pedigree,

04:57.631 --> 05:00.258
why exactly did you decide
to come back to advertising?

05:00.342 --> 05:03.178
Well, I‐I love it.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.806
It's creative,
uh, strategic.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.098
The people are fun.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.850
I want to start my
own firm one day.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.143
Well, I will definitely enjoy

05:10.268 --> 05:11.895
working with you
until you do.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.189
If you have any questions,
don't be a stranger.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.148
Oh, I won't.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.233
Okay.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.901
Michael: Thank you.
‐Thank you.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.402
Oh, and, uh‐

05:20.028 --> 05:21.154
Congratulations.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.656
Angela:
Thank you.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.995
What did I tell you?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.123
Angela:
Ooh, if I wasn't married.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.128
Angela:
Partner?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.798
Oh my goodness, Nicole,
that is incredible!

05:39.881 --> 05:40.715
Rick:
Nice!

05:40.841 --> 05:41.758
Well, okay, let's not
get our hopes up.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.468
It may not even
be a reality yet.

05:43.593 --> 05:47.597
My little sister,
the big fancy lawyer.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.933
Now we just need to find
you a suitable husband.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.560
Oh, don't even go there!

05:51.852 --> 05:52.811
What?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.479
Dating is normal.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.314
Not dating is not normal.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.441
When is the last time
you've been out with a man

05:58.525 --> 06:00.485
or even out with your friends?

06:00.569 --> 06:01.695
I'm here, aren't I?

06:02.612 --> 06:05.866
Yes, and you are so
amazing with Ryan.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.410
Don't you want kids
of your own someday?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.662
I get it, you're
focused on your career,

06:10.787 --> 06:14.875
and I am in awe of how
hard you work, but‐

06:15.667 --> 06:17.669
I'm proof you
can have it all.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.962
You've been out of
the game for 10 years.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.882
You have no idea what
it's like out there.

06:21.965 --> 06:22.883
These apps, Angela.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.137
There's guys without shirts
sending disgusting photos,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.055
selling teeth whitener
on Instagram.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.515
Wow.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.559
Nicole:
Believe me, being
single's a blessing.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.103
You just need to find
someone who's on your level.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.438
Maybe.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.023
Angela:
You need someone
who isn't gonna be

06:38.148 --> 06:40.150
intimidated by your ambition.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.902
And the pickings
are indeed slim.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.947
I think I have found
the perfect guy for you.

06:46.031 --> 06:46.948
Oh no, what have you done?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.533
Oh, nothing yet.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.168
Nicole:
I cannot believe you
convinced me to come here.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.628
What? You love art.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.380
Besides, you are gonna thank
me on your wedding day.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.757
Although, I did kinda
have to tell him

07:03.840 --> 07:06.593
it was a work thing
to get him to come.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.428
So he doesn't know
he's being set up?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.138
Or that I'm not his co‐worker?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.183
Not exactly.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.476
I'm sorry.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.729
I‐I cannot believe I
left work early for this.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.607
Listen, I swear I don't
know where everybody is.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.067
I said we were meeting
at eight o'clock.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.069
I must have gotten it wrong.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.236
Baby brain.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.280
But listen, Michael,
have you met Nicole?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.740
Nicole, Michael.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.325
Rick, come over
here with me.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.828
I want to show you this
artist that I'm dying to hire.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.205
Really, Angela?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.753
All right.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.839
Well, it's nice to meet you.

07:46.091 --> 07:46.967
So?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.721
What do you think of Michael?

07:53.264 --> 07:54.849
Rick:
He's fine, I guess.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.478
But he was kinda rude
to the bartender.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.646
Hm.
‐Yeah, he didn't leave a tip.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.982
Maybe he was just
short on change.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.318
For a guy who wears a Rolex,
he seems kinda insecure.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.487
You did not get
1600 on your SAT!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.280
I don't know what to
tell you, but I did.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.950
That is almost
statistically impossible.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.452
And yet it is
statistically possible.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.204
I know that because
I did that.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.248
What'd you get, 1590?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.834
No.
‐ You got 1590, didn't you?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.335
See, I beat you by 10 points,
and you're mad.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.004
Look at you.
‐ No, I'm not.

08:25.088 --> 08:25.797
You're competitive, huh?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.007
Nicole:
I'm not competitive.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.385
Okay, I'm a
little competitive.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.845
Michael:
I can see it.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.681
Nicole:
But, actually, I'm impressed.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.018
I don't really meet guys
who are as driven as I am.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.144
Oh.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.981
Well I don't meet women
who are as driven as I am.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.150
Would you say that
we're equally driven?

08:45.233 --> 08:48.403
Or that I'm more or less
driven than you are?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.613
Probably more, right?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.657
It's close.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.993
It's as close as
1590 is to 1600.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.457
Michael:
How 'bout I call
you sometime?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.916
Take you out on a real date?

09:05.795 --> 09:08.173
I think I'd like that.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.340
You sure?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.925
Nicole: Yeah.
‐ Okay, good.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.727
Chai tea latte half
syrup with almond milk.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.062
Just the way you like it.

09:22.187 --> 09:22.812
What are you doing here?

09:22.937 --> 09:24.981
I thought you had a thing.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.149
Wait.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.859
You're beaming.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.819
Did you get a new job?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.071
No.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.073
But I did meet someone.

09:33.198 --> 09:33.865
Wow!

09:33.948 --> 09:36.951
Miss Independent met a guy!

09:37.869 --> 09:39.162
And who, pray tell,

09:39.245 --> 09:41.498
has managed to meet
your extremely rigid

09:41.539 --> 09:44.209
and impossibly
high standards?

09:44.334 --> 09:45.585
It's early.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.961
I don't want to jinx it
so I'm just gonna say

09:47.045 --> 09:51.174
he's a handsome Stanford MBA
who works with my sister.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.884
Kyle:
Really?

09:53.009 --> 09:56.096
Well I won't believe he's real
until I meet him in person.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.013
But I am glad you're here,

09:57.138 --> 10:00.058
because I also have
some exciting news.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.644
Ooh, did Kyle Jr. pass
his Muay Thai test?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.146
Kyle:
Uh, no, he got
kicked in the head.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.773
But, I did talk with Glenn.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.275
He was really impressed
with your last outcome,

10:09.359 --> 10:12.654
and if you land
Capital Ventures as a client,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.115
I bet he makes you partner.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.116
You're joking.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.158
Kyle:
No pressure.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.244
We just have to ace the
pitch dinner with them.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.954
Oh my god.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.539
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god!

10:22.622 --> 10:23.498
You didn't‐

10:23.581 --> 10:24.958
You didn't hear that from me.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.584
Nicole:
Maybe my sister was right.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.961
Maybe I can have it all.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.465
Hey, Angela,
you got a minute?

10:32.549 --> 10:33.508
Hey, Michael!

10:33.591 --> 10:34.509
Of course!

10:34.592 --> 10:35.635
What's up?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.928
I got that brief for
the Quencher account.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.346
Thought you might want
to take a look at it.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.515
Quencher? That pitch
is months away.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.975
Too eager?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.810
I'm sorry, I get a little
obsessive when I got an idea.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.311
I can come back in a
few weeks if you want.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.271
Angela:
No.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.313
No, no, no worries.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.149
I like you taking
the initiative,

10:49.232 --> 10:50.108
so let's see what you got.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.151
Michael:
Here you go.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.193
Okay, let's see.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.153
So‐

10:53.278 --> 10:54.154
Thank you.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.280
Michael:
All right.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.158
Now, Quencher's really
trying to reach Generation Z

10:58.199 --> 10:59.284
with this next campaign.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.327
Now unlike Millennials,
these kids are very cognizant

11:01.411 --> 11:03.329
of the detrimental
effects their cellphones

11:03.454 --> 11:05.999
and social media
is having on them.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.960
They make a concerted
effort to carve out time

11:09.002 --> 11:10.837
for person to
person interaction.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.130
Okay, so we do a campaign

11:12.172 --> 11:14.465
about friends
sharing a Quencher.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.967
No phones, no screen time,

11:16.092 --> 11:19.053
just good
old‐fashioned conversation.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.221
It's old school.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.264
I like it.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.724
I think it's the way to go.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.851
Angela:
Okay. Well, I'll have the design
team work on the mock ups,

11:24.934 --> 11:26.144
and as soon as they're ready,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.271
Padma will call your
assistant and let you know.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.024
I'm actually still
interviewing for that position.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.443
You think you can have Padma
reach out to me directly.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.569
Oh. Will do.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.112
Okay.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.073
Is that a picture
of you and Nicole?

11:39.199 --> 11:39.908
Yeah!

11:39.991 --> 11:41.242
You guys always
been so close?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.911
Yeah, we have.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.079
She has always been
taller than me

11:45.205 --> 11:47.040
even though I'm
the big sister.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.918
She's really,
really protective.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.878
I think it's sweet the way you
two look out for each other.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.254
Angela:
Yes, it is.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.423
So, don't you screw it up.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.050
Noted.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.219
Though I have no intentions
of that happening.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.470
Angela:
Good.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.263
All right, I'm gonna
get outta here.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.181
I got a meeting.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.849
Okay, thank you, Micheal.
‐No problem.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.851
Angela:
Whew!

12:12.190 --> 12:13.399
Is that one of our
spokesmodels?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.653
No, that was Michael,
our new strategist.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.820
Wow.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.280
I can't keep track
of them all.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.156
Turnover's so high.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.158
Got a minute?
‐Absolutely, come on in.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.789
Nicole Brooks.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.123
Answering your
phone on a weekday.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.458
I didn't think you
had it in you.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.253
Well, you never know when
a client might be calling.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.295
Michael:
True.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.296
That is true.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.464
So, um‐

12:36.547 --> 12:37.632
As I promised,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.593
how do you feel about going
out on a proper dinner date?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.304
What if I told you I
had a better idea?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.181
All right, I'm listening.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.482
Now this I did not
expect out of you.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.483
I'm still getting
past the fact

12:55.566 --> 12:57.151
that you're an
actual gun owner.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.152
Is that weird?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.238
'Cause shooting helps
me relieve stress.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.032
Please don't think I'm crazy.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.992
No, no, no,
you're not crazy.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.159
It's not weird.
Nicole: No?

13:05.243 --> 13:07.287
I'm actually a little
turned on by it.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.873
Okay, well let's see if
you can return the favour.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.250
Oh, I can return the favour.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.672
I am a favour returner.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.090
You ready?
‐ Mmhm.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.140
That's embarrassing.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.017
At least you hit the target.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.311
Oh, you're loving this,
ain't you?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.353
Being the best?

13:32.437 --> 13:33.396
A little.
‐Yeah.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.398
All right, watch this.
Hold on.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.399
Okay.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.780
Oh.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.240
Michael:
Man, I'm only getting worse.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.326
It's okay.
‐I think it's the gun.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.202
Mm, I don't know.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.288
But it's okay,
I still like you.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.416
I like you too.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.377
Do you like food?
Do you like to eat?

13:56.461 --> 13:57.670
Of course.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.381
Michael:
I got reservations
at Beast Friday night.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.299
Come with me.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.133
Beast?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.384
Isn't that Michelin starred?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.844
How'd you manage that?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.387
Well I might not
be good with a gun,

14:06.512 --> 14:07.930
but I got other skills.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.059
Okay, I see you.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.477
I wouldn't miss it.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.978
Good.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.314
Excuse me.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.025
Want the scorecard?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.235
Nicole:
Ooh!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.904
I think that's my
first bullseye.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.238
Um, hello?

14:24.322 --> 14:26.449
No, this is not your
first bullseye.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.408
I got the 10.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.373
Kyle:
Okay, so, we need to
convince these execs

14:33.498 --> 14:36.584
that their current firm is
blowing it by playing it safe.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.710
That's why they're losing.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.462
They need to be
more aggressive.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
That's my specialty.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.090
That's what I'm counting on.

14:42.173 --> 14:45.134
Oh, by the way, they moved the
dinner up to tomorrow night.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.427
Great!

14:46.511 --> 14:47.553
Uh, wait, shoot.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.930
Kyle:
What's up?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.306
I made plans with Michael.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.975
But it's fine,
he'll understand.

14:53.059 --> 14:53.976
Kyle:
Sorry.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.269
I had to cancel plans too,

14:55.353 --> 14:57.647
with my wife's best friend
and her husband.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.482
Darn.
‐Mm.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.316
It‐it's fine.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.193
This is more
important obviously.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.613
Kyle:
Kinda and your partnership
may be riding on it.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.073
Exactly.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.164
It looks great.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.499
I mean, it's good.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.625
But the logo.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.961
Can we use a font that's a
little bit more youthful?

15:20.002 --> 15:21.003
You know, make it pop.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.213
This is the new generation.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.297
We want that to come through.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.841
Angela:
I'm not mad at that.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.468
I'll definitely give the
design team that note.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.970
So, on another note,

15:29.095 --> 15:30.680
how are things
going with Nicole?

15:30.805 --> 15:31.889
Michael:
Really well.

15:31.973 --> 15:32.765
Your sister's one
in a million.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.891
She's full of surprises.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.143
Angela:
For sure.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.310
She hasn't made you
meet her for one of those

15:36.436 --> 15:37.895
early morning breakfasts
that she loves?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.021
No, not yet.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.149
But I'm an early riser,
so that works for me.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.650
Angela:
No thank you!

15:42.733 --> 15:44.068
I believe in sleep!

15:44.193 --> 15:46.028
You know, she's a
workout fanatic.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.030
She gets up at like 4:30,
5:00 to workout.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.700
She says, "A fit brain is
a smart brain, Angie."

15:50.825 --> 15:51.701
Well that's not so bad.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.785
I mean, if you wake up,

15:52.869 --> 15:54.495
roll out of bed and
workout and home.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.621
Angela:
No.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.374
She goes down to that
health club Zenith downtown.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.918
I'm just so
happy that I'm pregnant

16:01.002 --> 16:03.129
so she cannot drag
me along with her.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.256
Michael:
Okay, well, um‐

16:05.840 --> 16:07.133
I'm gonna‐

16:07.216 --> 16:08.468
I'm gonna get outta your hair.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.596
Why don't you relax,
kick your feet up and, um‐

16:12.763 --> 16:14.640
Why don't you put some
heat on that back of yours.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.184
Another great idea.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.393
Thank you, Michael!

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
Hey, cutie.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.413
I just left a meeting
with your sister.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.790
It's obvious brains
run in your family.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.375
And don't you forget it.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.502
I hope you're working
up an appetite.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.545
I can't wait for our
date tomorrow night.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.630
About that‐

16:45.755 --> 16:47.215
I'm going to have
to cancel it

16:47.340 --> 16:49.008
because my very important
new client meeting

16:49.133 --> 16:50.676
got moved to tomorrow night.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.389
Michael?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.768
Are you there?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.479
I am so sorry!

17:01.604 --> 17:04.148
I was so looking forward
to seeing you and the food.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.275
Can I take a rain check?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.568
Listen, I'm not gonna
say I'm not disappointed.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.111
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

17:09.195 --> 17:11.614
to get reservations at
Beast on a Friday night?

17:11.697 --> 17:13.074
But, uh‐

17:14.242 --> 17:16.744
I guess with you I'm learning
that work comes first.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.828
Well in this case yes,

17:17.954 --> 17:20.873
but I still feel
awful bailing on you.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.459
What about the weekend?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.254
You know what, why don't
we play it by ear.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.922
I'll let you know
when I'm free.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.632
Good luck tomorrow night.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.177
What was that?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.431
Angela:
You blew him off?

17:37.515 --> 17:39.392
Nicole:
He wasn't angry,
but it was uncomfortable.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.810
Angela:
Oh my goodness.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.727
Nicole:
Work will always
come first for me,

17:41.852 --> 17:42.728
Beast or no Beast.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.313
Why'd you?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.982
He‐he was taking
you to the Beast?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.441
Are you serious?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.943
Damn, I would've been
pissed at you too.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.988
Do you know it is impossible
to get reservations there?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.657
Oh, so you're taking
his side now?

17:54.782 --> 17:55.866
We went on two dates.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.118
Be my sister.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.494
I am your sister.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.580
I am team Nicole.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.540
I'm just saying, I would
feel some kinda way too

18:02.623 --> 18:04.959
if a guy always blew
me off for work.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.627
What is this "always" stuff?

18:06.711 --> 18:07.336
Oh!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.839
With you it's always always.

18:09.964 --> 18:13.175
And at some point you are
going to have to find balance.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.344
I mean, no matter
who you're dating.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.470
Well, there may be
nothing to balance.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.180
I'm pretty sure I
might have blown it.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.599
Oh no, really?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.560
Yeah, he seemed fairly
non‐committal after I cancelled.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.728
It was weird.

18:23.811 --> 18:24.687
But‐

18:24.812 --> 18:27.273
I barely know him, so
maybe it's for the best.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.650
He's just such a nice guy.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.319
I mean, have you checked
his social media?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.487
Do you guys have
any mutual friends?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.322
Ange?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.198
You know I hate doing that.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.534
I pry enough into my
client's lives at work.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.911
I need to trust my instincts
in my personal life.

18:41.037 --> 18:41.912
Hm!

18:42.038 --> 18:42.830
Okay.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.458
Uh uh. And don't
you even dare!

18:47.668 --> 18:48.586
Fine.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.463
But do you remember

18:50.546 --> 18:53.549
how horrible my first
date was with Rick?

18:53.674 --> 18:54.592
Huh?

18:54.675 --> 18:55.968
Crazy!

18:56.052 --> 18:57.386
And do you remember
who encouraged me

18:57.470 --> 18:59.472
to give him another chance.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.599
Okay.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.392
Yes, you.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.520
And it was the best decision
that I've ever made.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
All I'm saying is why not
give him another chance?

19:08.606 --> 19:10.232
Do something nice for him.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.984
Make him feel like he matters.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.613
All right.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.448
Yay!

19:17.531 --> 19:18.574
Nicole:
I'll think about it.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.701
Right after I've landed
this partnership.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.037
Okay.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.538
Mmhm.
‐Okay.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.614
Michael?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.283
Nicole.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.326
What are you doing downtown?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.786
I thought you
lived in Whittier.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.872
Well I have a meeting with a
client early this morning,

20:06.997 --> 20:08.541
and I had a couple
passes to this gym,

20:08.666 --> 20:10.084
so I decided to come
by for a workout.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.168
What do they say?

20:11.293 --> 20:12.211
"A fit brain brain is a"‐

20:12.336 --> 20:13.337
"Smart one"?
‐Yeah.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.673
Yeah, so very true.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.217
All right, well it's
good to see you.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.885
I'm gonna get back
to this workout.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.262
Okay.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.641
Hey, Michael?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.101
Mmhm?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.310
Um‐

20:28.394 --> 20:30.688
I'm really sorry about
flaking on tonight.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.150
My client's dinner
is at Nique,

20:34.275 --> 20:35.985
which is right beside
my favourite bar.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.987
Maybe we can grab a drink?

20:39.655 --> 20:42.533
I'll either be celebrating
or drowning my sorrows.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.660
Yeah, I'd love that.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.121
And I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.581
I, uh‐

20:48.706 --> 20:49.832
I was just really looking
forward to spending time

20:49.915 --> 20:52.251
with you and the food.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.544
Well, I hate to leave,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.296
but I can't be late
for this meeting.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.464
Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.632
I'll text you later
about tonight?

20:58.716 --> 21:00.050
Michael:
All right, can't wait.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.218
And, uh, good luck
on your dinner.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.636
Knock 'em dead.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.721
Thanks.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.580
Nicole:
Hey!

21:35.211 --> 21:36.545
Hey there!

21:37.838 --> 21:38.839
Look at you!

21:39.965 --> 21:41.342
Good to see you too.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.302
Oh!
‐Some vino.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.762
Thank you.

21:45.846 --> 21:46.472
Cheers.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.167
Nicole:
Hey hot stuff!

22:15.251 --> 22:16.794
Hey, there she is.
‐Hey.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.171
How did it go?

22:19.255 --> 22:20.464
Oh, we killed it.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.633
They loved our take no
prisoners trial strategy,

22:22.758 --> 22:24.927
and they're already
sending over the paperwork.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.638
All right, well let's have a
couple of drinks to celebrate.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.598
Here you go, guys.
‐Okay.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.474
Oh!

22:30.599 --> 22:31.767
These look deadly.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.644
Manhattan.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.648
Here's to Nicole,
for being a legal badass.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.732
And here's to
you, Michael,

22:38.858 --> 22:40.818
for ordering us these
delicious drinks.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.994
I feel like I'm so overdressed.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.203
No, you look good.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.580
You're like a single
accessory away

22:52.705 --> 22:54.874
from being an
absolute masterpiece.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.793
Thank you.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.420
Um, well in that case‐

23:01.714 --> 23:03.924
Let me just add a
little something.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.180
Mmm.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.643
What do you think?

23:15.519 --> 23:16.854
I think you're beautiful.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.481
Thank you.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.150
It's vintage Hermes.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.403
I bought it with my first
paycheck at the firm.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.822
It's one of my most
treasured possessions.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.908
Well you definitely
have exquisite taste.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.911
Thank you.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.330
You want to get a table?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.789
Yeah, let's do it.
‐Okay.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.800
Michael:
So what was the guy like?

23:46.926 --> 23:47.801
What guy?

23:47.885 --> 23:49.136
The guy that you were
out for dinner with.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.306
Why would you assume
that the client was a man?

23:52.389 --> 23:57.394
I'll have you know our new
high stakes clients are women.

23:58.729 --> 23:59.730
Maybe you're right.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.148
Maybe I shouldn't assume.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.566
No, you shouldn't.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.903
Well, there is one guy.

24:06.028 --> 24:06.946
Okay.

24:07.029 --> 24:07.947
Yeah, who's that?

24:08.030 --> 24:09.365
His name is Kyle.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.076
He's my work husband
and he's great.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.369
He's so great.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.495
Your work husband?

24:14.620 --> 24:15.996
Yeah.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.042
Oops, that went quickly.

24:21.919 --> 24:24.129
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
have had a drink before dinner.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.882
How'd you know I had
a drink before dinner?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.218
You know.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.469
Clients are never on time.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.097
Oh, it's so true.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.848
It's so true.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.977
Are you with me right now?
‐Yeah I am. I'm good.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.103
How many fingers?

24:39.687 --> 24:40.521
I'm gonna have
to get you home.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.855
I'm good.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.899
Michael:
You really can
hold your liquor.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.317
Nicole:
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.568
Okay.

24:46.694 --> 24:47.945
Of course I'm fine.
‐All right, just checking.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.574
Well.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.492
This is you?

24:53.617 --> 24:54.994
Yeah.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.745
Michael:
It's cute.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.122
Oh, let me get that.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.044
Well, thank you for
escorting me home.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.587
Oh, of course.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.006
I'm a gentleman.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.342
Mm, I hope not too
much of a gentleman.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.595
What are you saying?

25:17.516 --> 25:18.392
Watch your step.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.810
Nicole:
Yup.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.669
Someone's had a weekend.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.465
Life is just really
beautiful sometimes, you know?

25:49.506 --> 25:50.466
Kyle:
Uh‐

25:50.507 --> 25:51.800
sure.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.261
Unless your dog decides to
get into a midnight rumble

25:54.344 --> 25:55.971
with a skunk.

25:56.055 --> 25:56.847
That's tragic.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.140
Kyle:
Mmhm.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.893
So why's your life
so beautiful?

26:01.018 --> 26:04.146
I spent the entire
weekend with Michael.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.441
I think we're on our way
to becoming a couple.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.026
Officially.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.153
Congratulations.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.571
Look at you.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.114
Abandoning your work husband,

26:14.198 --> 26:16.909
falling into lust,
making partner.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.495
You really do have it
all going on, don't you?

26:19.536 --> 26:21.038
Making partner?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.707
What did you hear?

26:24.792 --> 26:26.627
Let's just say the
company's throwing

26:26.710 --> 26:28.128
an impromptu party tonight

26:28.212 --> 26:30.631
to celebrate the new
contract you just won them.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.882
You might want to be there

26:31.965 --> 26:35.677
because there might
be an announcement.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.513
Oh and you know what?

26:37.638 --> 26:39.807
You should bring, um‐

26:39.890 --> 26:41.141
your official guy.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.476
I'm sure everyone would
love to meet him.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.477
His name is Michael.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.478
Kyle:
Michael.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.105
Nicole:
And maybe I will.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.236
Wow.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.739
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.915
I love being so
ahead of the game.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.876
You know, your laser focus
is rubbing off on me.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.295
I will definitely run
this up the chain.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.463
Maybe since we're so far ahead

27:11.547 --> 27:14.007
we should just wait for the
official campaign dates.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.093
Angela:
Don't you want to show
people what you're capable of?

27:17.177 --> 27:17.970
Yeah, of course.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.638
Yeah, no, you're right,
you're right.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.848
Angela:
So?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.474
How was your weekend?

27:22.558 --> 27:25.102
Uh, it was good.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.272
Your sister is
some kind of lady.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.982
I love new love!

27:30.023 --> 27:34.570
It's just so magical and
full of hope and excitement.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.654
Everything okay
with you and Rick?

27:35.696 --> 27:36.655
Huh?

27:36.697 --> 27:37.948
Yeah, we're good.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.324
Just being nostalgic.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.618
You know, things get
hectic when you have kids.

27:41.702 --> 27:42.995
That's what I hear.
‐Yeah.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.454
What does Rick do exactly?

27:44.538 --> 27:47.499
He's a stay at home dad,
and he's developing an app.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.667
Wow.
‐ Mmhmm.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.210
Stay at home dad.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.880
I'd be worried about Rick
and those stay at home moms.

27:53.005 --> 27:53.964
Oh, no, no, no.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.132
That's not Rick's style.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.508
Well if you ever
are concerned,

27:56.633 --> 27:59.636
you can always check his cell
phone's locations history.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.637
What?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.638
Yeah.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.056
Check this out.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.978
I heard about this website
called snoggle.timeout.com.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.314
Just punch it into somebody's
phone or their computer.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.650
The map on his phone is
linked to his email accounts.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.361
It's honestly a little
creepy and invasive.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.113
Michael:
It's not a breach of trust.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.532
It's just a new way to keep
track of your loved ones.

28:20.657 --> 28:21.366
Hm.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.660
Know what I mean?
‐Really? Oh, okay.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.996
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.332
Thank you.
‐It's the future.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.416
Oh, um‐

28:29.750 --> 28:30.834
Yeah, I'm late.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.044
I gotta meet your
sister for lunch.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.003
I gotta get outta here.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.255
Oh, well you guys have fun.
‐Okay.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.142
since high school.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.395
Have you always been
such a hopeless romantic?

28:51.688 --> 28:53.190
I think I'm just inspired.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.330
Come to my cabin.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.331
You have a cabin?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.457
Yeah.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.543
Yeah, it's nothing fancy,
but it's‐

29:15.420 --> 29:17.172
It's super private.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.049
It's a little bit rustic.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.301
I'm down with rustic.
‐Okay.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.472
Want to get on
the jungle gym?

29:25.555 --> 29:26.974
Yeah, let's do it.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.684
I'll race you there!

29:34.773 --> 29:37.317
Angela:
You know, I had this weird
moment with Michael today

29:37.401 --> 29:38.360
at work.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.613
Mixing too much
business with family?

29:41.697 --> 29:42.656
No, no.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.032
He‐he pulled out
his cellphone

29:44.157 --> 29:48.495
and showed me this weird
location tracker thing.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.248
So, did you know that if you're
logged into someone's email

29:51.373 --> 29:53.333
you can track
their every move?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.793
Yeah, it's pretty
much common practice

29:54.876 --> 29:56.795
in modern
relationships I'm afraid.

29:56.878 --> 29:57.796
Angela:
Really?

29:57.921 --> 29:58.797
Rick:
Yeah.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.632
That just sounds creepy to me.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.343
I'm so happy that
I'm not dating.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.471
Do you think he's using it?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.473
I hope not.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.602
You think I should
tell Nicole?

30:13.228 --> 30:16.273
I think that your sister
finally has a good thing going.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.483
And Michael was probably
just trying to impress you.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.444
I wouldn't read too
much into this.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.486
So‐

30:21.987 --> 30:23.530
You just think I'm, um, being‐

30:25.699 --> 30:26.658
Overprotective?

30:26.783 --> 30:28.118
Overprotective.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.538
Now can we please stop
talking about Michael?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.166
Yes.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.735
Glenn:
May I have your
attention, please?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.363
To Nicole Brooks,

31:46.488 --> 31:49.116
youngest lawyer ever
to make partner

31:49.199 --> 31:50.742
at Royston, Carter, and Klein.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.370
Congratulations.

31:53.829 --> 31:54.746
To Nicole!

31:54.871 --> 31:55.872
All:
To Nicole!

31:55.997 --> 31:56.998
Thank you.

31:57.082 --> 31:57.916
Woooo!

32:00.585 --> 32:01.420
Thank you.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.463
Nicole?
‐Thank you so much.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.297
Cheers.
‐Cheers.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.841
Glenn:
Congrats.

32:19.855 --> 32:20.647
Lisa:
So‐

32:20.772 --> 32:21.982
You must be Nicole's guy.

32:22.065 --> 32:22.983
It's so nice to meet you.

32:23.066 --> 32:23.984
I'm Lisa.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.485
Nice to meet you too, Lisa.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.321
You must be something
special to catch Nicole's eye.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.489
Ah‐

32:29.614 --> 32:31.741
She has the toughest
standards imaginable.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.327
Did you know she once
created a riddle?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.831
Okay, I couldn't even begin
to tell you how to solve it,

32:37.914 --> 32:40.000
but in order for anyone
to go out with her,

32:40.083 --> 32:41.460
they had to solve this riddle.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.171
And it was amazing because
she knew no one would solve it,

32:44.296 --> 32:46.465
you know, except that
one special someone.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.467
Did she make you
solve the riddle?

32:48.550 --> 32:49.509
Michael?

32:50.510 --> 32:51.428
Michael!
‐Hm?

32:51.511 --> 32:52.679
Yeah. What?

32:53.722 --> 32:55.474
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

32:55.557 --> 32:58.059
You look so familiar to me.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.478
Um, I don't think so.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.688
I think I just have one
of those faces, you know?

33:02.689 --> 33:03.482
Yeah.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.983
You do have one
of those faces.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.776
Yeah.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.361
Lisa:
You know what?

33:08.445 --> 33:13.742
You look just like my
friend's sister's boyfriend.

33:13.867 --> 33:14.701
That's crazy.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.286
Yeah.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.829
But you know, he's a
little bit taller than you.

33:17.954 --> 33:18.997
That's the only difference.

33:19.080 --> 33:19.998
Oh, okay.
‐That's the only difference.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.708
But you know‐
‐Sounds like a good guy.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.670
Kyle:
You shouldn't be
nervous tonight.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.005
Hi, Michael!

33:27.130 --> 33:29.007
Um, this is my work
husband, Kyle.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.050
Hey.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.843
We spend way too
much time together.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.470
Yeah, just ask my other wife.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.222
Ah, that's funny,
that's a good one.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.098
Um, you wanna get outta here?

33:37.182 --> 33:38.391
What? It's only 8:00.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.476
Can we stay for a little bit?

33:39.601 --> 33:41.353
Yeah it's her big
night after all. It‐

33:41.478 --> 33:42.646
Yeah, no, I‐I know.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.023
I'm just not feeling,
feeling good at all.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.233
Oh no, are you okay?

33:46.316 --> 33:48.944
I think it was something
in the crab cakes. Um‐

33:49.027 --> 33:49.945
Kyle:
Ooh.

33:50.028 --> 33:50.946
Michael:
I don't know.

33:51.029 --> 33:51.905
You know what?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.615
You stay, I'm gonna go, okay?

33:53.698 --> 33:55.367
Nicole:
No, no, no, no.
I'll go too.

33:55.492 --> 33:58.245
I should probably quit
while I'm ahead anyway

33:58.328 --> 33:59.746
now that I'm partner.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.041
Um, but we're gonna take off.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.084
Okay, yeah.
‐Okay?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.210
Bye.
‐See you tomorrow.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.003
Hey, congratulations, partner.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.713
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.593
I'll see you around.
‐Yeah, nice to meet you.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.611
Man, I thought life would get
easier after making partner,

34:31.695 --> 34:33.738
but it's just work
on top of work.

34:33.863 --> 34:38.535
Which never ends and only
gets worse and then you die.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.329
But at least we'll
die together.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.251
I don't know how you
juggle this with a family.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.378
Me either.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.299
So?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.301
What did you think of Michael?

34:54.426 --> 34:55.635
Pretty great, right?

34:55.760 --> 34:56.803
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:56.928 --> 34:57.804
He seems great.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.308
It's too bad you guys
had to leave early.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.517
How's he feeling?

35:02.601 --> 35:03.310
Oh, fine.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.811
Turns out it was
a false alarm.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.314
Really?

35:07.439 --> 35:08.815
Nicole:
Yeah.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.069
Angela:
Ah, one down,
another to go.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.154
What does E‐Bank want?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.822
Michael:
Campaign for savings.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.741
What's the deal with Kyle?

35:17.866 --> 35:18.617
Kyle?

35:18.700 --> 35:19.743
Michael:
Yeah, Nicole's work husband.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.161
What's his deal?

35:21.244 --> 35:22.245
Angela:
You know, they absolutely
enjoy working together.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.371
The feeling's mutual.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.539
But I was thinking, what if‐

35:24.664 --> 35:26.541
How long have they
been working together?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.460
Well, since Nicole
started working there.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.337
But I'm pretty sure
he's happily married.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.630
Pretty sure?

35:31.755 --> 35:33.131
Angela:
Okay, honestly, look,

35:33.214 --> 35:34.674
I don't know him like that.

35:34.799 --> 35:38.178
However, he's been
amazing to Nicole.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.180
What are we gonna
do for E‐Bank?

35:40.305 --> 35:41.222
Oh, right, yeah.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.307
I‐I came here to tell you

35:42.390 --> 35:44.142
that I'm revising
the brief right now.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.561
I'll come back
when it's ready.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.729
Oh, okay.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.980
Hey.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.690
Do you remember that photo
that I had over there?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.150
Yeah, it was cute.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.902
Um, I haven't been
able to find it.

35:54.027 --> 35:54.944
Have you seen it?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.781
No, I haven't but I'll
keep an eye out for it.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.074
Okay. Thank you.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.825
No problem.

36:01.868 --> 36:02.744
Hey, Padma.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.182
Michael:
Hey, Rod!

36:24.307 --> 36:25.225
How you doin', man?

36:25.308 --> 36:26.601
Hey, Michael!
How's it going, man?

36:26.685 --> 36:27.560
Michael: Good!
‐Nice to see you.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.728
Michael:
Good to see you.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.522
Rod:
Ah, you didn't have to.

36:30.647 --> 36:31.940
Oh, you're not that good.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.945
Hey, did you catch
the game tonight?

36:37.028 --> 36:38.655
Ah, disaster.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.614
Brutal!

36:39.698 --> 36:41.116
But don't worry, they're
gonna turn it around.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.283
Trust me, I got a feeling.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.827
I hope
you're okay, man.

36:43.952 --> 36:44.828
Have a good night.

36:44.953 --> 36:45.829
Take care.

36:45.954 --> 36:46.871
Hello!
‐Hello.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.289
Hi. Oh!
‐ These are for you.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.333
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.710
Come in, come in.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.214
That was incredible.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.592
I can't believe you
did all this for me.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.138
Well, I thought tonight
should be special.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.597
Oh yeah?

37:06.641 --> 37:07.976
I got you something.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.477
What'd you get me?

37:14.691 --> 37:15.859
I'm a little nervous.

37:16.818 --> 37:17.986
Open it.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.949
You're giving me a key?

37:23.032 --> 37:25.910
Well, a drawer couldn't
fit in the box, so‐

37:28.538 --> 37:29.873
Wow.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.251
I hope I'm not being
too presumptuous.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.335
Is it too soon?

37:34.461 --> 37:35.336
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:35.462 --> 37:36.337
It's perfect.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.505
And I want to
give you one too.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.299
As soon as my renos are done,

37:39.424 --> 37:40.967
you got a key.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.344
Nicole:
More wine?

37:43.470 --> 37:44.763
Please.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.017
I have to be honest.

37:49.142 --> 37:52.937
There is another reason why I
wanted tonight to be perfect.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.314
And why is that?

37:55.023 --> 37:58.026
Because I can't make it
to the cabin this weekend.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.071
What?

38:02.197 --> 38:03.281
I'm so sorry.

38:04.574 --> 38:05.784
It's just becoming a
partner is way more intense

38:05.867 --> 38:09.412
than I thought it would
be and I'm so bogged down.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.371
It's just for two days.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.623
I mean‐

38:12.040 --> 38:13.833
You need to get away,
I need to get away.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.586
I know, but I'm
really overwhelmed.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.379
We have a huge meeting
with the clients on Monday,

38:18.505 --> 38:19.798
and the trial's next week.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.300
Okay. Well, why don't you
bring your work to the cabin,

38:22.383 --> 38:23.635
and you can work
on it there.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.596
Well unfortunately we have
a lot of preparing to do,

38:26.679 --> 38:28.681
and I need to be
in the office.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.433
We?

38:31.518 --> 38:32.352
Who "we"?

38:32.477 --> 38:33.812
Me and Kyle.

38:34.521 --> 38:35.814
Oh, okay.

38:37.065 --> 38:37.982
Yeah, I understand.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.026
It's a very exciting
week for you.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.194
I get it.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.990
You sure you're
okay with this?

38:46.115 --> 38:46.991
Yeah.

38:47.116 --> 38:47.951
Okay.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.077
Thanks.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.373
Yeah.

38:54.374 --> 38:55.708
Here.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.980
Nicole:
I should be really
happy right now.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.147
I made partner,

39:18.231 --> 39:19.649
I have a gorgeous,
successful boyfriend

39:19.732 --> 39:21.985
who somewhat
supports my career.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.487
So why am I still feeling
like something's missing?

39:24.612 --> 39:25.822
Because life isn't
a fairy tale,

39:25.947 --> 39:28.199
and we can both agree that
you strive for perfection.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.494
I know, but something was
off about Michael last night.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.996
I just can't put
my finger on it.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.414
He was excited about the key‐

39:34.497 --> 39:35.540
Angela:
The key?

39:35.665 --> 39:36.875
Oh ho! Wow!

39:37.000 --> 39:38.334
Aren't we moving fast?

39:38.418 --> 39:39.919
Maybe.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.171
You know, I've never
seen his place?

39:42.255 --> 39:44.048
He always has some
excuse to come to mine.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.300
Is that weird?

39:45.383 --> 39:46.593
Angela:
Well, I mean most
guys would rather

39:46.676 --> 39:48.303
sleep on their
girlfriend's clean sheets.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.387
You know, he kinda shut down

39:49.512 --> 39:50.680
when I put off
our weekend away

39:50.805 --> 39:53.141
because Kyle and I needed
to focus on the trial.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.852
You don't think he's
jealous of Kyle do you?

39:55.977 --> 39:57.312
He did ask me how
long the two of you

39:57.353 --> 39:59.439
have been working together.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.232
But listen, Nicole.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.235
You are going to have to
get out of your own way

40:04.319 --> 40:06.321
if you want to make room
for love in your life.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.573
Maybe this is just your
way of finding fault

40:08.698 --> 40:09.908
to convince yourself.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.493
I just have more work
to do now than ever.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.745
If I'm a partner

40:13.828 --> 40:15.997
I need to be
concentrating on that.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.874
If I'm unsure about
Michael at all,

40:17.999 --> 40:19.334
he's just a distraction
at this point.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.420
A very good looking
distraction, but‐

40:22.503 --> 40:23.755
Yeah.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.173
Maybe I should put
on the brakes.

40:26.007 --> 40:29.052
Well, work is definitely
gonna be awkward,

40:29.177 --> 40:31.304
but, you know, listen,
whatever you decide,

40:31.429 --> 40:32.847
I will support you.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.224
I'll shift him over to
another creator director.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.978
He was becoming
my secret weapon.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.897
And I was enjoying the view.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.775
I gotta admit,
it was fun.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.945
But I really think I should
tell him how I'm feeling.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.197
Well, just let me
know how it goes.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.096
Nicole:
Hey, Michael.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.764
Hey, babe, I was just
wrapping things up.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.140
How's it going?

41:16.265 --> 41:17.141
Um, busy.

41:17.225 --> 41:20.269
And just about to
have some dinner.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.230
Okay, you got enough for two?

41:23.356 --> 41:24.399
Nicole:
Um‐

41:24.691 --> 41:26.943
Yeah, listen Michael.

41:27.819 --> 41:28.987
I don't know
how to say this

41:29.112 --> 41:33.157
but I think maybe we need
to slow things down.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.536
What'd you say?

41:36.619 --> 41:38.204
Nicole:
Just take a break.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.581
I just have a lot going
on at work right now,

41:40.707 --> 41:42.959
and this trial
is so consuming.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.086
I still have so much
to prove, you know?

41:45.169 --> 41:47.797
Youngest partner ever,
it's a lot of pressure.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.632
So you think I'm
holding you back?

41:49.716 --> 41:50.842
No, not at all.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.970
I just, I can't make you
a priority right now.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.596
And you deserve that.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.515
Is this about the key?

41:57.598 --> 41:58.850
What? No!

41:59.559 --> 42:02.311
Although I do think I
jumped the gun on that.

42:02.395 --> 42:04.814
Oh, yeah, no, don't worry,
I'm a give it back to you.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.316
So, what, this is
about Kyle then?

42:07.442 --> 42:09.027
Kyle? Are you serious?

42:11.070 --> 42:13.156
You know, I knew there was
something going on with you two.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.700
Okay, first of all, Kyle
is like a brother to me,

42:15.783 --> 42:17.910
so to insinuate
otherwise is crazy.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.039
Where is this coming from?

42:21.164 --> 42:24.208
Like, I'm sorry, but you are
completely out of line and‐

42:28.671 --> 42:30.173
Okay, well that went well.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.324
Hey, Ben, do you
have a minute?

42:56.365 --> 42:57.825
Yeah, of course, Angela.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.368
What's up?

43:00.328 --> 43:01.162
Okay.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.790
So, I was wondering
if you could maybe

43:03.873 --> 43:05.166
rearrange the
teams a little bit

43:05.249 --> 43:07.376
and move Michael
to a different CD.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.170
Ah, who's Michael again?

43:09.295 --> 43:11.839
Michael, he, um, is
the new strategist,

43:11.964 --> 43:13.049
the one you thought
looked like a model,

43:13.174 --> 43:14.467
all handsome.
‐Oh, right!

43:15.176 --> 43:16.302
Yeah.
‐Is there a problem?

43:16.385 --> 43:17.887
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There isn't a problem.

43:18.012 --> 43:19.013
He's actually great.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.099
Um, it's more of
a personal thing,

43:21.182 --> 43:23.101
a conflict of interest.

43:23.184 --> 43:25.645
I kinda introduced him
to my sister and eh‐

43:25.770 --> 43:27.063
Say no more.

43:27.188 --> 43:28.648
I'll talk to Steph,
see what she can do.

43:28.773 --> 43:29.649
Thank you.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.192
And I'm so appreciative.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.652
And I promise I'm not
trying to be difficult.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.070
Hey, you've more than
earned the right

43:34.195 --> 43:35.530
to be difficult, Angela.

43:35.655 --> 43:36.989
Thank you.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.291
Nicole:
Okay, so this proves
they went into the deal

43:47.375 --> 43:49.043
with the intent to
defraud our clients.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.086
Exactly.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.004
We hammer them on that.
They'll be boxed in.

43:53.172 --> 43:53.965
Okay, I‐

43:54.006 --> 43:55.383
I like that. Good.

43:56.425 --> 43:57.426
Hey.

43:57.510 --> 43:58.427
We're gonna do great.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.680
I know, I'm just feeling
a little out of my depth

44:00.763 --> 44:02.348
with this trial work.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.266
Listen,

44:03.349 --> 44:04.392
Glenn wouldn't have
put you on this

44:04.517 --> 44:07.145
if he didn't think
you were up for it.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.771
Besides, no one's gonna
be looking at anyone

44:08.855 --> 44:10.481
but the handsome First Chair.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.278
Oh, yeah.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.904
You know what,
we should take lunch.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.197
I gotta meet my wife.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.365
Do you want to come with?

44:19.490 --> 44:20.992
You can call Michael
and make it a foursome?

44:21.075 --> 44:23.202
Oh, actually,
we're on a break.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.412
Kyle:
Oh, really?

44:24.537 --> 44:25.413
Are you okay?

44:25.538 --> 44:26.164
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.292
I just need to focus on this.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.544
Okay, well in that case,
we'll celebrate tomorrow

44:31.669 --> 44:34.797
after I dazzle everyone
with our opening statements.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.465
I'm gonna hold you to that.

44:37.633 --> 44:39.051
Give my love to Cindy.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.511
Kyle:
Always do.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.224
Cindy:
Hey, babe!

44:46.517 --> 44:47.435
How's your day?

45:03.701 --> 45:06.037
Um, Padma could you come
here for a moment please?

45:07.955 --> 45:09.332
What up, boss?

45:09.415 --> 45:10.750
Angela:
Michael doesn't
know this yet,

45:10.875 --> 45:14.128
but I've asked Ben to move him
off of my campaigns if possible.

45:14.629 --> 45:15.796
Can I ask why?

45:16.380 --> 45:18.341
Nicole is having
some reservations,

45:18.466 --> 45:21.636
so she's decided to put
the brakes on things.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.639
I felt it was prudent to
separate business and personal.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.266
I always knew he was too
good looking to be true.

45:27.350 --> 45:31.312
Anyway, can you please, um, call
his assistant and reschedule

45:31.395 --> 45:32.939
the meeting we were supposed
to have for tomorrow?

45:33.022 --> 45:35.483
Sure but he doesn't even
have an assistant yet.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.401
I'm still scheduling
through him.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.195
Seriously?

45:39.320 --> 45:40.279
What's his extension?

45:40.363 --> 45:41.989
Ah, he's still using
his cellphone,

45:42.073 --> 45:43.658
apparently some
mixup with IT.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.659
Okay.

45:44.784 --> 45:48.079
Well, please schedule
with him however you can.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.622
Will do boss.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.756
Owner:
Yeah, well, no, I
ordered a part,

45:58.839 --> 45:59.799
it's a water pump,

45:59.924 --> 46:01.801
could take a week,
maybe two.

46:01.926 --> 46:02.802
Yeah.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.262
Yeah.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.180
Listen, I'll, uh, I'll give
you a call back, all right?

46:06.264 --> 46:07.640
Yeah, bye.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.102
Hey.
‐Hey, uh‐

46:12.144 --> 46:13.354
Lookin' to get an oil change.

46:13.479 --> 46:14.563
Owner:
Yeah, sure.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.107
I'm gonna probably need
to keep it overnight.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.900
Michael:
Any chance I can
get a loaner?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.568
Yeah, sure.

46:19.694 --> 46:20.611
Licence, please.

46:20.695 --> 46:21.654
Yeah.

46:29.662 --> 46:30.830
Thank you.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.458
All right.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.252
Just sign here.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.510
Do you have keys?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.137
Oh yeah.
‐ Yeah.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.811
All right, William,

46:53.936 --> 46:54.979
you're all set
with a loaner.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.522
It's the grey one out there.

46:56.647 --> 46:59.191
Just return it by
noon tomorrow.

46:59.275 --> 47:00.484
All right.
Thanks, buddy.

47:00.568 --> 47:01.569
Yeah.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.744
Kyle:
I'm certain that
you will agree

47:09.869 --> 47:14.582
that $10 million is a fair
and accurate compensation.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.876
Thank you.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.170
Perfection.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.839
You make it seem
so effortless.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.601
Well, I need my beauty sleep,

47:33.684 --> 47:36.645
and I think we've done
all we can do tonight.

47:36.729 --> 47:38.564
Music to my ears.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.816
I'll meet you at quarter
to eight, right?

47:40.900 --> 47:42.068
Kyle:
Mm.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.486
You're taking that with you?

47:43.611 --> 47:44.737
Yeah, I just want to
take a final look

47:44.862 --> 47:46.197
at everything again.

47:46.864 --> 47:47.823
Of course you are.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.743
Oh, promise me you'll
get some rest.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.869
I promise.

47:53.662 --> 47:54.413
Shoot.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.499
I just remembered
I promised Glenn

47:56.582 --> 47:58.209
I'd send him a brief
on the Bowman account.

47:58.334 --> 47:59.418
Are you serious?

47:59.502 --> 48:00.628
Go on, get outta here.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.420
But I can wait.

48:01.504 --> 48:02.797
No, no, absolutely not.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.924
It‐it may take a while.

48:05.007 --> 48:07.635
I just may not be
glowing tomorrow.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.886
Okay, if you insist.

48:09.011 --> 48:10.805
I'll see you
bright and early.

48:10.888 --> 48:11.764
Good night.

48:11.847 --> 48:13.224
Good night.

49:34.013 --> 49:35.639
What happened?

49:35.764 --> 49:36.974
Oh my god!

49:37.057 --> 49:38.559
Kyle, you're awake!

49:39.351 --> 49:40.853
Where's Cindy?

49:40.978 --> 49:43.314
Nicole:
Oh, she's taking the
kids to your sister's.

49:43.439 --> 49:44.732
She'll be back soon.

49:45.483 --> 49:48.486
Why do I feel like I've
been T‐boned by a train?

49:48.569 --> 49:51.322
It was a hit and run
in our parking garage.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.699
We don't know much else,

49:53.824 --> 49:56.660
because someone tampered
with the security cameras.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.914
Was somebody waiting for me?

50:00.039 --> 50:03.000
I don't know, but maybe this
has to do with the trial?

50:04.001 --> 50:06.337
Oh god, the trial.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.797
Nicole:
Yeah, they pushed
it to tomorrow.

50:08.881 --> 50:09.924
Yeah, I'm no doctor,

50:10.007 --> 50:12.968
but something tells me I'm
not gonna by 100% by then.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.930
One day is all the
judge would give us,

50:16.013 --> 50:17.598
even with Glenn's influence.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.476
You'll have to take over.

50:21.310 --> 50:22.186
Nicole:
I'm too green with trial.

50:22.311 --> 50:23.479
They pulled in Beth.

50:23.562 --> 50:24.980
Kyle:
You know this
case inside out.

50:26.315 --> 50:29.985
Beth isn't gonna be able to
learn it in time for opening.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.362
It needs to be you.

50:31.487 --> 50:32.655
You know that.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.912
I'm gonna go get the nurse.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.374
P.A. Announcement:
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.

50:43.499 --> 50:44.875
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.

50:50.506 --> 50:51.465
Michael:
Hey, Nicole!

50:51.507 --> 50:52.466
How you doin'?

50:52.508 --> 50:54.051
Michael? What are
you doing here?

50:54.176 --> 50:55.344
I heard about Kyle.

50:55.469 --> 50:56.845
Nicole:
How did you even
hear about that?

50:57.846 --> 50:59.014
I brought flowers.

50:59.682 --> 51:01.016
Thanks. I'll go
give them to Kyle.

51:01.141 --> 51:03.644
Michael:
No no, they're not for him,
they're for you.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.604
Michael‐
‐ Listen.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.607
I'm sorry I was a jerk
about the cabin thing.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.693
I'm sorry I was a
jerk about Kyle.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.653
Just forgive me.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.780
I'll make it up to you,
all right?

51:15.698 --> 51:17.533
Do you not understand
the seriousness

51:17.658 --> 51:19.159
of what's going on here?

51:19.285 --> 51:21.078
Yeah, that's why I
got you flowers.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.748
How can you not see how
inappropriate this is?

51:25.624 --> 51:27.501
Kyle almost died and
you're at the hospital

51:27.626 --> 51:28.919
trying to win me back?

51:29.003 --> 51:31.422
How can you be so
smart and so stupid?

51:31.505 --> 51:32.756
I don't want these.

51:32.840 --> 51:33.549
I don't want us.

51:33.674 --> 51:35.467
You and me,
we're not a thing.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.177
So please just go home!

51:57.615 --> 51:58.824
Angela:
Oh.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.247
Hey, honey,
how are you?

52:05.372 --> 52:06.457
How's Kyle?

52:06.540 --> 52:08.042
Nicole:
He woke up, thank God.

52:08.167 --> 52:09.918
I'm headed to work shortly.

52:10.002 --> 52:12.004
I can't believe I have to
keep going with this trial.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.464
I'm not sure I can do this.

52:13.589 --> 52:14.590
Angela:
That's understandable.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.467
Have you even slept?

52:17.885 --> 52:20.638
And I'm concerned about you
if someone targeted Kyle.

52:20.721 --> 52:22.431
You mean is there a
maniac on the loose

52:22.514 --> 52:24.141
trying to affect the
outcome of the trial?

52:24.183 --> 52:25.434
Don't worry about me.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.186
Glenn's hiring
security just in case.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.979
That's a relief.

52:29.104 --> 52:29.980
Speaking of crazy,

52:30.105 --> 52:32.441
guess who showed up
at the hospital.

52:32.524 --> 52:33.484
Angela:
Who?

52:33.567 --> 52:34.652
Michael.

52:34.777 --> 52:35.736
What?

52:35.861 --> 52:36.570
How?

52:36.654 --> 52:38.572
Nicole:
It was creepy actually.

52:39.615 --> 52:40.616
How did I miss this?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.493
It's like he won't
take no for an answer.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.661
Angela:
Okay.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.579
Okay, you know what,
that is not okay.

52:45.663 --> 52:46.830
Do you want me
to talk to him?

52:46.955 --> 52:50.209
'Cause I will hammer
home the point.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.502
No, it's okay.

52:51.627 --> 52:53.462
I don't want to make things
weird for you at work.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.713
It's the least I can do.

52:54.838 --> 52:56.090
I helped get you
in this mess.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.466
I have to help get you out.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.759
Nicole:
Okay, thanks.

52:59.551 --> 53:00.761
Um, I gotta go.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.263
Love you, bye.
‐ Bye.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.820
Glenn:
Are you sure you can handle
opening statements, Nicole?

53:17.945 --> 53:19.571
The clients are
counting on us.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.699
Yes, 100%, I got it.

53:21.782 --> 53:22.908
Glenn:
I know I'm going
out on a limb,

53:23.033 --> 53:25.035
but, uh, you've never
let me down before.

53:25.160 --> 53:28.247
Besides that'll give Beth time
to get up to speed on the case.

53:28.372 --> 53:30.082
I know it's not ideal but‐

53:30.207 --> 53:31.959
do you have the casework?

53:32.000 --> 53:32.793
Got it.

53:32.835 --> 53:34.878
Great. I'll let
you two get at it.

53:37.464 --> 53:38.590
Hi.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.634
Where do you think
we should start?

53:40.759 --> 53:43.011
Which section have you
been working on so far?

53:44.513 --> 53:45.681
Hey, Angela, you
wanted to see me?

53:45.806 --> 53:47.975
Angela:
Michael, come on in,
sit down.

53:50.018 --> 53:53.439
So, I just wanted to check on
you with everything going on.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.607
I'm really sorry that you
and Nicole didn't work out.

53:55.691 --> 53:56.859
Are you okay?

53:56.984 --> 53:58.360
I'm okay,
thanks for asking.

53:58.819 --> 53:59.987
She tell you I went
to the hospital?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.029
She did.

54:01.155 --> 54:03.407
And that was probably
not the right time

54:03.532 --> 54:04.783
for a romantic gesture.

54:04.867 --> 54:05.993
You know, I don't know
what I did wrong.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.161
You know, I just
wanted to let her know

54:07.286 --> 54:08.787
that I was always
thinking about her,

54:08.871 --> 54:10.247
that I was there for her.

54:10.372 --> 54:13.709
Right now, Nicole just
needs to focus on her career,

54:13.792 --> 54:17.004
and she doesn't have time
for anything or anyone else.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.297
Do you get that?

54:18.756 --> 54:19.840
Yeah, of course, sure.

54:19.923 --> 54:20.716
Yeah.

54:20.841 --> 54:21.675
Don't you think you
deserve someone

54:21.759 --> 54:23.177
who has more time for you?

54:25.095 --> 54:27.765
Nicole is just the type of girl
that is married to her career

54:27.848 --> 54:30.142
and there's nothing that
you or I can say or do

54:30.267 --> 54:31.435
to change that.

54:34.521 --> 54:35.689
Thank you, Angela.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.024
That's really helpful.

54:37.107 --> 54:38.442
Yeah.

54:38.525 --> 54:39.485
Padma:
Hey.

54:39.610 --> 54:40.652
I just wanted to remind you

54:40.736 --> 54:42.446
of your 11:00 a. m.
conference call.

54:43.530 --> 54:44.531
I'm so sorry.

54:44.656 --> 54:45.699
I have to take that.

54:45.824 --> 54:46.742
No, that's fine.

54:46.867 --> 54:47.701
I have a meeting
downtown anyway.

54:47.826 --> 54:48.744
Thank you again.

54:48.869 --> 54:50.078
I really appreciate it.

54:50.204 --> 54:51.330
No problem.

54:58.045 --> 55:00.714
You know you don't really
have a conference call, right?

55:00.839 --> 55:01.715
Angela:
I know.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.217
Thank you.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.095
What did you say his
last job was again?

55:07.971 --> 55:09.723
Um, Creative Arts Lab.

55:11.350 --> 55:12.768
Okay.

55:13.977 --> 55:15.354
I'm glad that's done.

55:20.526 --> 55:23.695
Nicole:
And that is why you'll
see that $10 million

55:23.821 --> 55:26.323
is a fair and
accurate compensation.

55:27.449 --> 55:28.659
Thank you.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.285
You have done it
a million times.

55:30.369 --> 55:32.454
Trust me, Nicole,
you're gonna be great.

55:32.538 --> 55:33.872
Maybe I should run it again,

55:33.997 --> 55:36.834
add back in that part
about gross compensation?

55:36.875 --> 55:38.293
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.630
Have you slept at all
since Kyle's accident?

55:41.713 --> 55:43.006
No, not really.

55:43.632 --> 55:44.466
Come on.

55:44.591 --> 55:45.968
Let's get outta here.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.014
If you say so.

56:00.691 --> 56:01.692
Can you drive her please?

56:01.817 --> 56:03.443
She's borderline delirious.

56:05.028 --> 56:07.239
Hey, do you want me
to take the brief?

56:07.364 --> 56:08.574
Uh, I got it, really.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.534
I just want to review
it one more time.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.578
Thanks, Beth.
See you tomorrow.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.121
Goodnight.

56:14.538 --> 56:15.914
Thank you very much.

56:29.678 --> 56:31.054
Nicole:
Thank you, thank you.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.769
Security:
Okay, have a good night.

56:38.478 --> 56:40.397
Thank you so much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

58:01.186 --> 58:02.354
Michael?

58:03.605 --> 58:05.232
Thank god. Man, you had me
scared there for a minute.

58:05.357 --> 58:07.109
I scared you?
You scared me!

58:08.318 --> 58:10.654
Sorry, I was trying to be quiet.
I know it's late.

58:10.737 --> 58:11.655
But what are you doing here?

58:11.738 --> 58:13.198
I thought you and
Nicole broke up?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.241
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We did.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.201
I'm just here to pick
up a few things.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.494
She's working all
hours of the night

58:17.619 --> 58:19.663
ever since she became partner,
you know?

58:19.788 --> 58:21.123
Isn't that the truth.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.083
Nice seeing you, man.
Take care.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.334
Yeah, you too.

1:00:49.688 --> 1:00:50.772
What?

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:57.487
Oh my god, oh my god.

1:00:57.612 --> 1:00:58.822
Oh no.

1:00:59.239 --> 1:01:00.407
Oh my god.

1:01:08.039 --> 1:01:08.999
Hi! Um‐

1:01:09.124 --> 1:01:11.084
When I got out of
my car last night,

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:13.170
did I leave the
brief in there?

1:01:14.754 --> 1:01:15.547
No‐

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.591
Okay, are you sure
it's not in the car?

1:01:18.717 --> 1:01:19.593
Okay.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:20.802
Okay, thanks.

1:01:20.927 --> 1:01:22.345
No, no, no, no, no.

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:23.430
Breathe.

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:25.974
Why is this happening to me?

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:27.434
Oh my god.

1:01:34.941 --> 1:01:36.318
Oh my god.

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:44.492
Hey, Padma.
‐ Hey.

1:01:44.576 --> 1:01:46.036
Just dropping these
files off for Angela

1:01:46.161 --> 1:01:47.037
before heading uptown.

1:01:47.162 --> 1:01:48.205
Okay, I'll make
sure she gets them.

1:01:48.330 --> 1:01:49.664
Michael:
Okay.

1:01:49.748 --> 1:01:50.999
Padma:
Do you need me to
validate your parking?

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:52.334
My
car's in the shop.

1:01:52.459 --> 1:01:54.211
I rideshared here today.

1:01:54.336 --> 1:01:55.295
But thank you.

1:01:55.420 --> 1:01:56.296
Padma:
All right.

1:01:56.421 --> 1:01:57.714
All right, take care.

1:02:29.829 --> 1:02:30.914
Ah, it's almost done.

1:02:31.790 --> 1:02:33.375
Hey, do you guys, uh‐

1:02:34.167 --> 1:02:35.293
buy cars too?

1:02:35.377 --> 1:02:36.336
Yeah, sometimes.

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:37.462
Why, you want to
sell the Beamer?

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.756
Well what can I get for it?

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:41.466
It's a couple years old.

1:02:42.175 --> 1:02:43.718
I could give you
20 grand for it.

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:45.679
20 grand, cash?

1:02:45.804 --> 1:02:46.888
Cash is king.

1:02:47.973 --> 1:02:49.307
She's all yours.

1:03:05.532 --> 1:03:06.992
Owner:
It's all there.

1:03:09.202 --> 1:03:10.620
Michael:
Thanks, buddy.

1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:18.920
Glenn:
What do you mean
you can't find it?

1:03:19.004 --> 1:03:19.963
Nicole:
I'm sorry.

1:03:20.088 --> 1:03:20.964
I was tired.

1:03:21.089 --> 1:03:22.799
I don't know, I must
have left it somewhere.

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:24.426
Beth:
What about the
security guy's car?

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:25.593
I saw you get in
the car with it.

1:03:25.677 --> 1:03:28.305
I called.
He couldn't find it.

1:03:28.388 --> 1:03:30.140
Glenn:
Does Kyle have
the backup files?

1:03:30.265 --> 1:03:31.641
Of course!

1:03:32.726 --> 1:03:34.602
But wouldn't we have to
reveal the security breach?

1:03:34.686 --> 1:03:36.896
Read the opposing counsel's
disclosure documents?

1:03:37.981 --> 1:03:39.190
That's right.

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:41.318
If we can't locate the brief,

1:03:41.359 --> 1:03:42.527
then we have to
inform the judge,

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:44.529
and if the judge doesn't
dismiss the case outright

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:45.655
and the defendants
don't waive time,

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:48.700
we have no choice
but to move forward.

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:51.745
You've left me no choice.

1:03:51.870 --> 1:03:54.247
Beth, starting tomorrow
you'll take over the case.

1:03:54.372 --> 1:03:55.582
Get onto Kyle's computer

1:03:55.707 --> 1:03:56.875
and get everything you
can off the server.

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.753
And as far as the disclosure
docs are concerned,

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:01.671
you're gonna
have to wing it.

1:04:01.796 --> 1:04:03.214
You're pulling me
from the case?

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:04.549
I'm firing you, Nicole.

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:07.052
We'll be lucky if our
reputation survives this!

1:04:33.995 --> 1:04:34.662
He

1:04:34.788 --> 1:04:36.081
fired you?

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.668
I almost died yesterday.

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.838
That's cold.

1:04:43.963 --> 1:04:47.842
Nicole:
Well I pretty much
torpedoed the case.

1:04:47.967 --> 1:04:49.219
And the company, so‐

1:04:49.969 --> 1:04:52.305
Who knows, you might be
out of a job soon too.

1:04:53.181 --> 1:04:56.434
Well I didn't really
like that job anyway.

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:01.898
Oh god.

1:05:04.025 --> 1:05:05.110
Come on‐

1:05:05.193 --> 1:05:06.778
Whiskey?

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:07.779
What is this?

1:05:07.862 --> 1:05:08.988
Really?

1:05:09.114 --> 1:05:10.532
I'm unemployed now.

1:05:14.702 --> 1:05:16.871
Oh my god,
I'm unemployed now!

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:19.374
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:05:19.499 --> 1:05:20.792
No, no, no, come on.

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:23.962
Hey, come on, it's okay.

1:05:25.755 --> 1:05:27.841
Kyle:
I'm sure he's just panicking.

1:05:29.134 --> 1:05:31.136
Ten bucks says he
calls you tomorrow

1:05:32.178 --> 1:05:33.721
and begs you to come back.

1:05:36.015 --> 1:05:37.475
Come on, look at me.

1:05:39.686 --> 1:05:41.604
You gonna share some
of that whiskey?

1:05:45.692 --> 1:05:46.943
Only a little.

1:05:47.026 --> 1:05:48.486
Oh yeah, there we go.

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:50.947
With the meds and all.

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:53.908
Just a little bit.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:56.619
Just give me a little more.

1:05:57.537 --> 1:05:58.955
Come on, what are you,
my mother?

1:05:59.038 --> 1:05:59.956
Come on.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:03.877
Nicole:
You're gonna get
me in trouble.

1:06:05.462 --> 1:06:06.838
More.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:11.968
I might as well just
give you the rest.

1:06:30.361 --> 1:06:31.988
Nicole:
I got fired, Angela.

1:06:32.113 --> 1:06:33.281
They let me go.

1:06:33.573 --> 1:06:34.991
Angela:
What?

1:06:35.116 --> 1:06:35.992
What happened?

1:06:37.285 --> 1:06:39.954
Nicole:
I messed up and lost
the trial brief.

1:06:41.122 --> 1:06:42.332
This is so humiliating.

1:06:42.457 --> 1:06:43.833
What am I gonna do?

1:06:44.542 --> 1:06:46.461
Angela:
Oh sweetie,

1:06:46.544 --> 1:06:49.255
I am so, so sorry.

1:06:49.339 --> 1:06:50.298
Where are you?

1:06:50.381 --> 1:06:51.549
Do you need to
come over here?

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:52.842
No, it's okay.

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:54.135
I'm at the hospital
with Kyle.

1:06:54.260 --> 1:06:55.136
I'm just gonna stay here

1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:57.597
until I have to pack
up my stuff tomorrow.

1:06:58.473 --> 1:07:00.225
I can come get you right now.

1:07:00.308 --> 1:07:01.935
No, I'm fine.

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:03.811
Unless, of course,

1:07:03.895 --> 1:07:05.939
Michael shows up again
with more flowers.

1:07:07.065 --> 1:07:08.691
Angela:
Listen, don't joke
about that, okay?

1:07:08.816 --> 1:07:10.860
Rick says you need to
talk to your neighbour Rod

1:07:10.985 --> 1:07:14.155
and tell him that Michael is
not welcome there anymore.

1:07:14.239 --> 1:07:17.200
We need as many sets of
eyes on you as possible.

1:07:17.325 --> 1:07:20.036
Nicole:
Angela, do you really
think he's that unstable?

1:07:20.161 --> 1:07:21.996
I mean, yeah, the whole
flower thing was a bit crazy,

1:07:22.121 --> 1:07:25.625
but I can't imagine him
wanting to hurt anyone.

1:07:25.708 --> 1:07:27.252
I just think he can't
handle rejection.

1:07:28.336 --> 1:07:31.047
Honestly, listen.

1:07:31.172 --> 1:07:33.132
Michael is about
two seconds off

1:07:33.216 --> 1:07:35.885
of boiling bunnies in
your kitchen, okay?

1:07:36.010 --> 1:07:37.804
So can you please
talk to Rod?

1:07:37.887 --> 1:07:39.931
Just for my piece of mind.

1:07:40.014 --> 1:07:42.976
If it will make you
feel better I will.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:45.728
Keep your head up high
at the office tomorrow.

1:07:45.853 --> 1:07:47.814
Call me if you need me.

1:07:47.939 --> 1:07:51.192
And listen, things are gonna
sort themselves out, okay?

1:07:51.317 --> 1:07:52.360
Don't worry.

1:07:52.485 --> 1:07:53.861
I hope so.

1:07:53.987 --> 1:07:54.988
Love you.

1:07:55.697 --> 1:07:56.906
Love you.

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.357
Hey.

1:08:31.733 --> 1:08:33.401
What did you do to Nicole?

1:08:33.484 --> 1:08:35.653
Nicole:
So I guess you heard
what happened.

1:08:35.737 --> 1:08:37.155
For what it's worth, I
think it's totally B. S.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:38.281
that they're firing you,

1:08:38.364 --> 1:08:40.658
especially considering
the circumstances

1:08:40.742 --> 1:08:42.118
with Kyle and everything.

1:08:42.702 --> 1:08:43.995
Thanks, Lisa.

1:08:44.078 --> 1:08:45.913
So what are you
gonna do next?

1:08:46.873 --> 1:08:47.874
Nicole:
You know, it's been
a really long time

1:08:47.999 --> 1:08:50.126
since I have not had a plan.

1:08:51.169 --> 1:08:54.797
I think I'm gonna take some
time and think about life.

1:08:54.881 --> 1:08:57.050
Well, if you need a
character reference,

1:08:57.175 --> 1:08:57.967
just let me know.

1:08:58.092 --> 1:08:59.844
I appreciate that, thanks.

1:09:02.305 --> 1:09:03.389
Oh.

1:09:03.514 --> 1:09:06.434
I remembered why your boyfriend
looked so familiar to me.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.145
Ex‐boyfriend, but why?

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:11.898
Lisa:
He looked just like this
guy my friend used to date,

1:09:12.023 --> 1:09:13.149
but that guy's
name was Todd.

1:09:13.232 --> 1:09:15.777
Your guy's definitely
Michael, right?

1:09:16.361 --> 1:09:17.236
Yeah, Michael.

1:09:17.362 --> 1:09:18.571
Thank God,

1:09:18.696 --> 1:09:20.531
because my friend had to get a
restraining order from this guy.

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:23.701
He started stalking her,
showing up everywhere.

1:09:23.785 --> 1:09:24.827
It was crazy.

1:09:24.911 --> 1:09:26.496
That sounds horrifying.

1:09:26.621 --> 1:09:27.664
Yeah.

1:09:27.789 --> 1:09:29.499
Those guys could
be twins though.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:31.459
Anyway,

1:09:31.584 --> 1:09:32.585
take care.

1:09:32.669 --> 1:09:34.003
Good luck with everything.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:35.672
Don't be a stranger.

1:09:35.755 --> 1:09:37.131
Yeah.

1:10:05.868 --> 1:10:06.786
Hey, Nicole.

1:10:06.869 --> 1:10:07.995
Jesus! Michael!

1:10:08.538 --> 1:10:10.665
I'm sorry, I‐I didn't
mean to scare you.

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:11.708
Nicole:
What are you doing here?

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:12.834
Are you following me?

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:13.751
No, no. I just‐

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.628
I just came by
to give you this.

1:10:15.712 --> 1:10:16.921
Nicole:
What is this?

1:10:17.004 --> 1:10:19.298
I thought I was clear we're
not getting back together.

1:10:19.424 --> 1:10:21.467
Yeah, that's your‐your key,
the key you gave me.

1:10:21.551 --> 1:10:22.552
I'm giving it back to you.

1:10:22.677 --> 1:10:23.636
Michael, I'm so sorry.

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:24.762
I just‐

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:26.347
I've been exhausted
and things have been,

1:10:26.472 --> 1:10:28.057
well, kinda crazy.

1:10:29.183 --> 1:10:30.560
I appreciate you
returning this.

1:10:30.685 --> 1:10:32.061
Thank you.

1:10:32.186 --> 1:10:33.813
Yeah. You know, I just wanted
to do something nice for you

1:10:33.938 --> 1:10:35.231
since you lost your job.

1:10:36.023 --> 1:10:37.859
Wait, how do you even
know about that?

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:39.986
Oh, yeah, um‐

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:41.195
Nicole:
Oh my god!

1:10:42.655 --> 1:10:43.823
You know, I've been
trying to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

1:10:43.948 --> 1:10:44.824
I've even been defending you.

1:10:44.949 --> 1:10:46.451
But Ange was right,
you're a creep!

1:10:46.534 --> 1:10:48.703
And you need to stop following
me and leave me alone!

1:10:49.287 --> 1:10:50.496
Angela said I was a creep?

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:52.165
Yes and she's right!

1:10:52.248 --> 1:10:54.333
Now just leave me
alone, please!

1:10:54.417 --> 1:10:55.334
All right.

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:42.632
I'm sorry, Hiring M:

1:11:42.757 --> 1:11:44.091
but nobody named Michael Langdon
ever worked here.

1:11:44.175 --> 1:11:45.468
Are you sure?

1:11:45.551 --> 1:11:47.720
Tall, killer smile,
looks like a supermodel?

1:11:47.845 --> 1:11:51.265
Hiring Manager:
Hm, I think you're talking
about Todd Langdon,

1:11:51.349 --> 1:11:54.393
but we had to fire him after he
stalked one of our assistants.

1:11:54.519 --> 1:11:56.270
Even broke into
her apartment.

1:11:56.354 --> 1:11:58.397
Why would our company
even hire someone like that?

1:11:58.523 --> 1:11:59.816
Hiring Manager:
Well, if it's Todd,

1:11:59.899 --> 1:12:01.651
I'd be checking to
see if they did.

1:12:01.692 --> 1:12:03.361
Okay, thanks.

1:12:18.626 --> 1:12:19.502
Ben:
Padma.

1:12:19.627 --> 1:12:20.586
I'm looking for Angela.

1:12:20.670 --> 1:12:22.213
Do you know where
I might find her?

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:24.257
I think she went home because
of a babysitting emergency.

1:12:24.340 --> 1:12:25.466
Well, would you let her know

1:12:25.591 --> 1:12:28.135
that this new
strategist, Michael,

1:12:28.219 --> 1:12:29.971
that she asked
about transferring,

1:12:30.054 --> 1:12:32.306
I have no idea who
she's talking about

1:12:32.390 --> 1:12:33.808
and he's not on the payroll.

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:35.351
Are you sure?

1:12:35.476 --> 1:12:36.811
Ben:
Yeah. Tell her to give
me a call when she can,

1:12:36.936 --> 1:12:38.521
and we'll get to
the bottom of this.

1:12:38.646 --> 1:12:40.064
Thanks.

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:51.284
Rod:
Hey, Nicole.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:52.702
Hey, Rod.

1:12:52.785 --> 1:12:54.036
Uh‐

1:12:54.287 --> 1:12:55.538
You got a minute?

1:12:55.663 --> 1:12:56.455
Rod:
Yeah, sure.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:58.249
What's up?
Are you okay?

1:12:59.417 --> 1:13:01.460
This is gonna sound
a little crazy,

1:13:01.586 --> 1:13:03.170
but you know Michael,
my ex?

1:13:03.296 --> 1:13:04.380
Rod:
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1:13:04.505 --> 1:13:05.673
He seemed like a
pretty cool guy.

1:13:05.798 --> 1:13:06.716
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1:13:06.841 --> 1:13:07.800
Well, actually,

1:13:07.884 --> 1:13:09.385
he's having a hard time
getting over the breakup.

1:13:09.510 --> 1:13:12.138
And honestly, he's freaking
me out a little bit.

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:15.933
Can you just keep an eye
out for me around here?

1:13:16.017 --> 1:13:17.643
Yikes, absolutely,
yeah, of course.

1:13:17.768 --> 1:13:18.644
Thanks.

1:13:18.728 --> 1:13:19.687
I appreciate it.

1:13:21.022 --> 1:13:23.441
And I'm getting these locks
changed first thing tomorrow.

1:13:24.901 --> 1:13:27.653
He got his stuff okay
the other night, right?

1:13:29.030 --> 1:13:30.156
What do you mean?

1:13:30.239 --> 1:13:33.159
Rod:
Well the night before last,

1:13:33.242 --> 1:13:34.160
when you were working late,

1:13:34.285 --> 1:13:36.162
he was here picking
up some things.

1:13:47.006 --> 1:13:48.299
Okay.

1:13:52.803 --> 1:13:53.721
Michael.

1:14:06.192 --> 1:14:08.235
Todd Langdon.

1:14:12.782 --> 1:14:14.241
Oh my god.

1:14:17.578 --> 1:14:18.788
Come on, Angela.
Pick up.

1:14:25.086 --> 1:14:26.128
Pick up.

1:14:26.212 --> 1:14:28.339
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

1:14:46.524 --> 1:14:47.692
Padma. What's up?

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:49.026
Is everything okay?

1:14:49.151 --> 1:14:50.319
Padma:
No, Rick, Michael's
not who he says he is!

1:14:50.444 --> 1:14:52.154
I have a very bad feeling!

1:14:52.238 --> 1:14:54.407
You need to be with
Angela right now!

1:14:55.366 --> 1:14:57.076
Just tell her to stay at
the office til I get there.

1:14:57.201 --> 1:14:58.744
She got your email,
she already left!

1:14:58.869 --> 1:14:59.704
What?

1:14:59.829 --> 1:15:00.746
What email?

1:15:00.871 --> 1:15:02.081
The email you sent
saying your mom was sick.

1:15:02.206 --> 1:15:03.916
No, Padma, I never
sent an email!

1:15:04.041 --> 1:15:05.584
I'm gonna call the police!

1:15:14.844 --> 1:15:15.803
Come on, pick up.

1:15:16.303 --> 1:15:17.138
Come on.

1:15:17.221 --> 1:15:18.389
Come on, Angela.

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:19.932
Answer the damn phone!

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:23.060
Come on.

1:15:27.898 --> 1:15:28.816
Come on.

1:15:29.191 --> 1:15:30.484
Come on.

1:15:36.699 --> 1:15:38.409
Hey, Nicole.
How's it going?

1:15:38.534 --> 1:15:40.703
Nicole:
Why are you answering
my sister's phone?

1:15:41.704 --> 1:15:43.581
Let me speak to
Angela right now!

1:15:43.706 --> 1:15:45.583
I believe she's
indisposed at the moment,

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:47.293
but if you want to see
your sister alive,

1:15:47.418 --> 1:15:49.545
you'll get in your car
and you'll come join us.

1:15:49.670 --> 1:15:51.839
No police or she's dead,
you got it?

1:15:52.673 --> 1:15:53.632
Nicole:
Please do not hurt her.

1:15:53.716 --> 1:15:54.550
I'll do whatever you ask.

1:15:54.675 --> 1:15:56.844
This is between you and me.

1:15:57.636 --> 1:15:59.638
I'll text you the coordinates.

1:16:08.981 --> 1:16:10.357
Damn it!

1:16:10.941 --> 1:16:12.359
God!

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:50.731
Angela?

1:16:55.361 --> 1:16:56.737
Mom?

1:16:57.363 --> 1:16:58.739
Mom:
Over here, dear.

1:16:59.448 --> 1:17:00.491
Is Angela with you?

1:17:00.574 --> 1:17:02.660
No, she's not home
from work yet.

1:17:03.702 --> 1:17:05.454
Lock the door and don't
open it until I get back.

1:17:05.538 --> 1:17:07.414
Mom: What do you mean?
‐Just lock the door!

1:18:26.035 --> 1:18:27.036
Hello?

1:19:34.353 --> 1:19:35.562
Angela?

1:19:43.862 --> 1:19:45.948
What did you do to her?

1:19:47.408 --> 1:19:48.784
Relax.

1:19:49.326 --> 1:19:49.994
She's alive.

1:19:50.119 --> 1:19:51.328
Nicole:
What did you give her?

1:19:51.412 --> 1:19:52.496
She's pregnant!

1:19:52.579 --> 1:19:54.790
That's the least of
her worries right now.

1:19:59.044 --> 1:19:59.920
What is this place?

1:20:00.004 --> 1:20:01.046
Do you live here?

1:20:01.171 --> 1:20:03.465
Yeah, it's a bit
of a fixer upper.

1:20:03.590 --> 1:20:06.135
I like to call it my
cabin in the city.

1:20:06.218 --> 1:20:08.762
You would know that if
you made time for us.

1:20:10.222 --> 1:20:12.349
Why did you bring us here?
What are you gonna do?

1:20:13.434 --> 1:20:15.144
I'm not gonna do anything

1:20:15.269 --> 1:20:16.228
to you.

1:20:17.271 --> 1:20:18.188
I love you.

1:20:30.075 --> 1:20:31.368
The Cleo Awards?

1:20:32.411 --> 1:20:33.620
From last year?

1:20:35.456 --> 1:20:37.291
But that was before
I even met you.

1:20:37.875 --> 1:20:39.960
It's the first night
I ever laid eyes on you.

1:20:41.086 --> 1:20:43.213
You were the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:45.799
It was love at first sight.

1:20:45.924 --> 1:20:47.801
Nicole:
But you didn't approach me,
ask me out?

1:20:47.885 --> 1:20:50.346
Instead you decided
to wait and stalk me?

1:20:50.471 --> 1:20:51.597
Stalk you?

1:20:54.183 --> 1:20:58.270
It wasn't hard to find
Angela from the event photos.

1:20:58.354 --> 1:21:01.398
So you got a job with her
company just to get to me?

1:21:01.523 --> 1:21:03.108
Technically, I
didn't get a job.

1:21:04.318 --> 1:21:06.236
Nicole:
Oh, so you didn't
even work there.

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:09.782
You really are sick.

1:21:09.865 --> 1:21:12.993
I was gonna come up with an
excuse to resign after we met.

1:21:13.994 --> 1:21:16.121
It just felt so good
to be working again.

1:21:17.539 --> 1:21:19.083
Have somebody as
brilliant as Angela

1:21:19.208 --> 1:21:20.292
appreciate my ideas.

1:21:21.710 --> 1:21:22.669
I thought at the very
least I'd be able to

1:21:22.795 --> 1:21:25.172
leverage it into
a job reference.

1:21:26.799 --> 1:21:28.926
And now what, you're
gonna get rid of us?

1:21:30.010 --> 1:21:31.095
Michael:
Get rid of you?

1:21:33.514 --> 1:21:34.932
Nicole‐

1:21:36.517 --> 1:21:37.643
I love you.

1:21:38.352 --> 1:21:39.311
I would never hurt you.

1:21:40.979 --> 1:21:43.065
But there's no telling
what I would do to anybody

1:21:43.190 --> 1:21:44.858
who stands between
you and me.

1:21:47.361 --> 1:21:51.156
Michael if you really love me,
you will not hurt Angela.

1:21:52.991 --> 1:21:54.952
She is poisoning
you against me.

1:21:57.037 --> 1:21:59.373
She's got you thinking
I'm creepy and dangerous.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:01.834
Who knows how
many other people

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:03.669
she's trying to
turn against me?

1:22:04.878 --> 1:22:06.296
That's why we gotta
get outta here.

1:22:13.512 --> 1:22:14.680
Mya MacIntosh.

1:22:16.223 --> 1:22:17.349
You like the photo?

1:22:17.599 --> 1:22:18.767
I feel like I chose
the best one.

1:22:18.851 --> 1:22:20.352
Here, take it,
take a look.

1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:23.355
You want us to
leave the country?

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:24.648
Michael:
Yeah.

1:22:24.731 --> 1:22:27.192
You really believe
you can pull this off.

1:22:28.277 --> 1:22:29.403
I sold everything I own!

1:22:30.529 --> 1:22:33.490
My condo, my car,
my damn Rolex!

1:22:33.615 --> 1:22:34.867
I liked that watch!

1:22:36.910 --> 1:22:38.495
After I sell this building,

1:22:39.746 --> 1:22:42.082
which I can do outside
of the country,

1:22:43.584 --> 1:22:44.710
we'll have more than
enough to live on

1:22:44.835 --> 1:22:46.378
for a long time, Nicole.

1:22:47.463 --> 1:22:48.630
And Angela?

1:22:48.714 --> 1:22:49.965
Oh, that's gonna be
a little complicated

1:22:50.048 --> 1:22:51.925
to bring her along with us.

1:22:52.009 --> 1:22:53.719
I'm not going
without Angela.

1:22:55.679 --> 1:22:57.014
Nicole‐

1:22:58.265 --> 1:22:59.308
this is only gonna work if
you're a willing participant,

1:22:59.433 --> 1:23:00.350
all right?

1:23:01.477 --> 1:23:03.145
That's always been the
problem in our relationship.

1:23:03.270 --> 1:23:04.771
It's always gotta
be about you.

1:23:04.855 --> 1:23:06.899
I need you to be on my
team right now, okay?

1:23:10.903 --> 1:23:12.237
You're right, Michael.

1:23:14.406 --> 1:23:18.243
I have been selfish
and insensitive,

1:23:19.077 --> 1:23:20.245
but you don't have
to hide anymore,

1:23:20.329 --> 1:23:22.789
because I've been denying
my feelings for you.

1:23:27.544 --> 1:23:28.420
You have?

1:23:28.504 --> 1:23:29.880
Nicole:
Yes.

1:23:31.507 --> 1:23:32.466
Honestly, I'm‐

1:23:33.091 --> 1:23:35.385
I'm glad you
sabotaged the trial.

1:23:37.763 --> 1:23:40.182
I'm grateful I lost
the job because

1:23:40.307 --> 1:23:41.517
now that I've had some
distance from it,

1:23:41.642 --> 1:23:43.393
I can see what I
really needed.

1:23:44.311 --> 1:23:47.064
You've shown me that love is
more important than anything.

1:23:49.316 --> 1:23:51.276
See, that's what I've
been saying.

1:23:52.319 --> 1:23:53.654
You're finally
seeing it my way?

1:23:54.530 --> 1:23:57.282
Now I can focus all
my energy on you and us.

1:23:58.158 --> 1:23:58.992
Michael:
Okay, but what about Angela?

1:23:59.076 --> 1:24:00.452
Because, you know, she‐

1:24:02.704 --> 1:24:03.830
If somebody asks
her what happened,

1:24:03.956 --> 1:24:05.832
they're gonna come
looking for me.

1:24:06.667 --> 1:24:09.044
No, Michael.

1:24:10.003 --> 1:24:12.089
Angela will never get in
the way of my happiness.

1:24:12.172 --> 1:24:13.298
She always has my back.

1:24:13.423 --> 1:24:15.259
Remember, it was her
idea to set us up.

1:24:17.386 --> 1:24:18.387
Yeah that's true,
she did‐

1:24:21.557 --> 1:24:23.225
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god!

1:24:23.850 --> 1:24:24.977
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god!

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:26.478
Are you okay?
‐Yes.

1:24:27.521 --> 1:24:29.147
Oh, he's moving, he's moving,
he's moving!

1:24:29.690 --> 1:24:31.108
You're not going anywhere.

1:24:32.359 --> 1:24:33.527
Michael‐

1:24:33.652 --> 1:24:35.320
Please listen to me.

1:24:35.445 --> 1:24:36.446
Put the gun down.

1:24:38.532 --> 1:24:40.867
What are you gonna do,
you gonna shoot me?

1:24:41.577 --> 1:24:43.120
Put the gun down, Michael!

1:24:51.587 --> 1:24:52.963
I thought you
loved me, Nicole.

1:24:57.342 --> 1:24:58.468
I still love you.

1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:03.140
Angela.

1:25:04.725 --> 1:25:06.143
We made a good team.

1:25:21.908 --> 1:25:22.951
Rick:
It's okay.

1:25:23.035 --> 1:25:24.453
It's all over.

1:25:25.412 --> 1:25:26.538
Angela:
How?

1:25:40.218 --> 1:25:41.511
Child:
Wait, where are you going?

1:25:41.637 --> 1:25:42.638
Child:
To kick it.

1:25:42.763 --> 1:25:44.097
Nice kick.

1:25:44.181 --> 1:25:45.682
Girl:
You don't know
how to kick it!

1:25:45.766 --> 1:25:47.142
Let's see.

1:25:47.225 --> 1:25:47.893
Oh!

1:25:48.018 --> 1:25:50.687
You are the best
auntie ever!

1:25:50.812 --> 1:25:52.314
Thank you so much,
I love it!

1:25:52.439 --> 1:25:54.650
Well, he's just the
cutest baby ever!

1:25:54.733 --> 1:25:56.568
Aren't you, sweetheart?

1:25:56.693 --> 1:25:58.320
Say, "Thank you, Auntie!"

1:25:58.403 --> 1:26:01.323
Listen, this is about you,
this whole party.

1:26:01.406 --> 1:26:03.450
You are the one
with the new job.

1:26:03.867 --> 1:26:04.826
Kyle:
I still can't believe

1:26:04.951 --> 1:26:06.703
you're not gonna be
my work wife anymore.

1:26:07.829 --> 1:26:09.956
And that you're leaving
me for that guy.

1:26:10.874 --> 1:26:11.708
Nicole:
Hey!

1:26:11.833 --> 1:26:13.627
He's a touch on
the mature side.

1:26:15.754 --> 1:26:16.922
But seriously though.

1:26:17.005 --> 1:26:18.674
Are you sure we can't
entice you to come back?

1:26:18.799 --> 1:26:21.051
I'm sure you could squeeze
Glenn for a lot more money.

1:26:21.176 --> 1:26:23.470
He feels really bad
about everything.

1:26:23.595 --> 1:26:26.556
I think it's time for a change,
but thank you.

1:26:28.475 --> 1:26:29.601
Who's that guy?

1:26:32.854 --> 1:26:33.730
Hi.
‐ Hi.

1:26:33.855 --> 1:26:35.190
I'm Michael.

1:26:35.273 --> 1:26:35.941
Rick.

1:26:36.024 --> 1:26:37.150
Yeah, I‐I work with Joe.

1:26:37.275 --> 1:26:38.610
Rick:
Oh, okay, okay.

1:26:39.277 --> 1:26:40.404
Angela:
Look, I didn't do it.

1:26:40.529 --> 1:26:41.196
I didn't invite him.

1:26:41.321 --> 1:26:43.490
I swear, my set
up days are over.

1:26:43.573 --> 1:26:44.658
Nicole:
Okay.
