WEEKS: Before we start, I
want you to know something.

01:15.078 --> 01:16.746
I'm not a rat.

01:17.796 --> 01:19.931
You understand?

01:20.076 --> 01:22.947
I want that on record before we start.

01:23.147 --> 01:24.197
OLSEN: Okay.

01:24.232 --> 01:25.703
You are not a rat.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.959
And it's on record.

01:28.498 --> 01:31.175
Mr. Weeks, the charges against you...

01:31.232 --> 01:34.560
racketeering, extortion, kidnapping,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.529
and accomplice to
murder... are very serious.

01:37.582 --> 01:40.353
Am I correct in stating
that you are here today

01:40.388 --> 01:43.210
to make a deal with the federal government?

01:43.722 --> 01:45.023
Correct.

01:45.055 --> 01:46.288
And am I correct in stating

01:46.323 --> 01:49.403
that you are going from trusted confidant

01:49.438 --> 01:53.610
to one of South Boston's most
notorious and violent gangsters

01:53.698 --> 01:56.034
to government witness?

01:56.578 --> 01:57.669
Correct.

01:58.106 --> 02:01.399
Then I need to know everything you know

02:01.502 --> 02:03.575
about the Winter Hill Gang,

02:03.745 --> 02:06.022
the FBI and John Connolly,

02:06.147 --> 02:10.414
and specifically, what you
know about your former boss

02:10.487 --> 02:14.140
and now fugitive, James "Whitey" Bulger.

02:16.617 --> 02:18.075

Yeah. It'll be a good time tonight.

02:34.089 --> 02:34.730
We got to do it.

02:34.765 --> 02:36.787
Sorry, buddy. I can't let you in.

02:36.822 --> 02:38.690
That's cool, man. I'm friends with Jimmy.

02:38.725 --> 02:39.710
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.012
- You're with Jimmy?
- Yeah.

02:41.044 --> 02:44.040
Well, I still can't let you in.

02:44.075 --> 02:45.373
Who the fuck are you?

02:45.408 --> 02:47.819
I'm the guy who works here.

02:47.851 --> 02:49.091
You probably don't remember this,

02:49.126 --> 02:51.511
but you were here last Saturday night

02:51.546 --> 02:52.396
with a few of your friends

02:52.431 --> 02:53.495
around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

02:53.530 --> 02:55.660
You took a piss up against the bar.

02:55.692 --> 02:58.201
And that's frowned upon here.

02:58.236 --> 03:02.106
But if you go down to Brannigan's

03:02.141 --> 03:02.833
just right down there,

03:02.868 --> 03:06.026
they'll let you take a shit
in the middle of the floor

03:06.061 --> 03:07.550
if that's what you want to do.

03:07.585 --> 03:09.830
But you can't... you can't do it here.

03:09.865 --> 03:11.100
All right. Yeah.

03:11.135 --> 03:11.862
Okay?

03:11.897 --> 03:14.581
Oh, yeah, we'll go. Hey, look.

03:14.673 --> 03:16.567
No hard feelings, okay?

03:16.602 --> 03:20.231
Get the fuck out of my fucking
way, you fuckin' retard!

03:31.064 --> 03:33.029
running his mouth again.

03:33.197 --> 03:35.928
She go over there and she got
a little fork in her pocket,

03:35.973 --> 03:37.135

03:37.167 --> 03:38.602
She walk right in there,

take his fuckin' eye out

03:41.239 --> 03:43.044

03:43.079 --> 03:45.011
And Connors was fuckin' in there.

03:45.046 --> 03:47.132
He couldn't even look. He had to look away.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.694
Connors ain't no tough guy.
Denucci whipped his ass in 59.

03:50.729 --> 03:53.160
Of course he did. He's
a professional fighter.

03:53.195 --> 03:54.205
Yeah, so's Connors.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.322
Connors is a tough kid,

03:55.357 --> 03:58.783
but Joe Denucci's the real
thing, it's all I'm saying.

03:58.818 --> 04:00.157
Well, I'm saying that Connors

04:00.190 --> 04:02.004
didn't want no part of this broad.

04:02.073 --> 04:03.742

04:14.989 --> 04:16.916

04:16.971 --> 04:20.829
which is filled with God knows
what kind of fuckin' bacteria,

04:20.898 --> 04:25.788
and then you take the same
big fat fuckin' filthy fingers

04:25.899 --> 04:27.818
and you stuff 'em back into the bowl

04:27.851 --> 04:30.887
that is there for public consumption.

04:30.922 --> 04:34.078
Now, what the fuck are you thinkin', John?

04:34.152 --> 04:36.178
Well, I wasn't thinking, Jimmy.

- Get in the fuckin' bar.
- Come on, pretty boy.

Yeah.

05:29.810 --> 05:32.633
Yeah, he's Charlie McTiernan.

- I mean...
- Kill the engine.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.123
[engine turns over]

07:47.985 --> 07:51.344
WEEKS: And just fucking
like that, I was Winter Hill.

07:51.655 --> 07:54.230
And it was a big deal to me.

07:55.222 --> 07:56.805
OLSEN: What'd you do?

07:57.148 --> 07:58.668
WEEKS: The everyday, small-time stuff...

07:58.703 --> 08:00.682
the rackets, driving around making pickups,

08:00.717 --> 08:03.702
checking on our vending machines, you know.

08:03.802 --> 08:05.882
And listenin' to Mickey bullshit.

08:05.962 --> 08:09.035
So, this guy at the Libra
Lounge in Revere over there

08:09.083 --> 08:12.648
is tellin' me that the
porn stars in California,

08:12.744 --> 08:14.021
they eat a lot of celery

08:14.056 --> 08:15.678
before they're gonna perform, you know?

08:15.713 --> 08:17.342
Wait. Whoa. Stop for a second.

08:17.377 --> 08:19.615
That's old Mrs. Cody.

08:19.688 --> 08:21.861
Mickey, you remember old Mrs. Cody?

08:21.896 --> 08:23.024
Of course I do.

08:23.059 --> 08:25.369
Going strong. Look at her.

08:28.399 --> 08:29.872
Pardon me, Mrs. Cody,

08:29.907 --> 08:32.080
but I think I smell a little shepherd's pie

08:32.115 --> 08:33.635
sneaking out of that bag there.

08:33.669 --> 08:34.354
Am I right?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.366
As I live and breathe, it's Jimmy!

08:36.399 --> 08:39.865
- It is.
- When did you get out of Alcatraz?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.841
Oh. Uh... that's nearly 10
years ago now, Mrs. Cody.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.353
- Oh.
- More than a minute.

08:45.388 --> 08:46.609
Well, it's wonderful

08:46.644 --> 08:49.099
to have you back in the neighborhood, son.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.749
You remember Mickey, don't you?

08:50.784 --> 08:51.589
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Mickey.

08:51.624 --> 08:53.890
How are you, sweetheart?
It's nice to see you.

08:53.925 --> 08:55.213
You know this kid, Kevin?

08:55.248 --> 08:56.420
Your paper boy, right?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.232
I grew up a little bit, huh?

08:58.267 --> 09:00.448
Make sure everything gets put away nice.

09:00.525 --> 09:02.677
She got everything she needs, huh?

09:02.752 --> 09:04.195
WEEKS: The truth of the matter is,

09:04.227 --> 09:07.224
a lot of people in Southie loved Jimmy.

09:07.259 --> 09:09.626
OLSEN: And you'd include
John Connolly in that group?

09:09.689 --> 09:11.803
WEEKS: Well, especially John Connolly.

09:11.836 --> 09:13.748
I mean, he grew up in the projects

09:13.783 --> 09:16.172
a few doors down from the Bulger brothers.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.613
He was tight with Billy,

09:17.648 --> 09:19.237
but like every other
kid in the neighborhood,

09:19.272 --> 09:21.904
he was in awe of Jimmy.

09:21.985 --> 09:23.764
The story goes, when he was growing up,

09:23.799 --> 09:26.189
Connolly was taking a
beating from some guys,

09:26.224 --> 09:28.918
and Jimmy stepped in and
saved his ass, I guess.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.130
MORRIS: We've now come home

09:30.165 --> 09:32.175
to focus on this office's top priority,

09:32.228 --> 09:34.170
which is really the North
End of the Italian Mafia,

09:34.205 --> 09:35.669
led by Gennaro Angiulo.

09:35.704 --> 09:37.665
He's a hell of a cop,
he's a straight shooter,

09:37.700 --> 09:40.003
and, well, we're damn lucky to have him.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.132
Welcome, John.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.001
[applause]

09:44.157 --> 09:46.861
WEEKS: You know, Southie kids...

09:46.896 --> 09:48.826
we went straight from
playing cops and robbers

09:48.861 --> 09:51.964
on the playground to doing
it for real in the streets.

09:52.273 --> 09:53.698
And just like on the playground,

09:53.733 --> 09:56.283
it wasn't always easy to tell who's who.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.513
CONNOLLY: There he is.

09:58.548 --> 10:00.404
Oh, John!

10:00.801 --> 10:01.833
How are you?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.010
Yeah, good.

10:03.090 --> 10:04.531
If I'm buying anyone,

10:04.566 --> 10:06.176
- I'm buying Gary Carter.
- Gary Carter.

10:06.211 --> 10:08.641
That kid is a star in the making.

10:08.790 --> 10:09.918
Which is why it'll never happen.

10:09.953 --> 10:12.110
Not in a million fuckin'
years. You know why?

10:12.145 --> 10:14.721
BOTH: Because it's the Sox.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.150
[both chuckle]

10:16.185 --> 10:18.321
So, seriously, what do I call you now?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.290
I mean, is it Billy?

10:20.416 --> 10:22.393
Or I got to call you Senator?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.805
Oh, come on. I'm the one drooling here.

10:24.873 --> 10:26.474
Mr. FBI Hero.

10:26.586 --> 10:27.324
[laughs]

10:27.392 --> 10:28.885
How's the wife? How's Marianne?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.732
Great. Can't complain.

10:30.798 --> 10:34.214
Well, look at you. Look at you.

10:35.309 --> 10:37.466
I haven't forgotten where we came from.

10:37.566 --> 10:39.073
"Don't you ever do that again.

10:39.108 --> 10:40.976
I want to see you throw the first punch,

10:41.076 --> 10:42.464
and throw the first two punches."

10:42.499 --> 10:44.339
[both chuckle]

10:44.446 --> 10:47.468
Oh, man. Yeah, I got to
get down to the Old Harbor.

10:47.503 --> 10:48.906
You ought to, John.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.950
Your ma would love to see you.

10:51.097 --> 10:53.401
How's, uh... how's your brother?

10:53.436 --> 10:54.532
How is Jimmy?

10:54.567 --> 10:56.124
Jimmy's Jimmy.

10:56.159 --> 10:57.183
You know?

10:57.218 --> 10:58.142
Why do you ask?

10:58.177 --> 10:59.404
Well, it's no secret

10:59.439 --> 11:02.073
that Southie's been a war zone lately.

11:02.118 --> 11:05.250
What, with 60, 70 slayings?

11:05.335 --> 11:07.968
But your brother and his Winter Hill boys,

11:08.003 --> 11:09.159
they're still out there.

11:09.194 --> 11:12.142
They must be doing something right. Right?

11:14.357 --> 11:16.724
All right, John. Let's
call this what it is.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.364
You're jerking me off under the table

11:18.438 --> 11:19.501
- to get to Jimmy.
- I'm not.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.151
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

11:21.186 --> 11:23.455
It sure as hell ain't none of mine.

11:24.175 --> 11:27.732
I got an edict to eradicate the Mafia.

11:27.886 --> 11:30.595
And I know that Jimmy and Stephen Flemmi

11:30.630 --> 11:32.594
are musclin' in on their numbers rackets

11:32.629 --> 11:35.082
and their vending machines.

11:35.166 --> 11:38.071
And I know that this ain't
sitting very well with Angiulo.

11:38.106 --> 11:38.900
I don't want to hear this.

11:38.935 --> 11:41.004
You need to hear this, Billy.

11:41.717 --> 11:43.498
Your brother...

11:44.723 --> 11:47.665
is wading in some very dark waters.

11:51.195 --> 11:55.064
You know... we all need friends.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.135
Even Jimmy.

11:58.294 --> 11:59.894
Even you.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.562
Nobody gets there on their own.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.520
Ain't that right, Senator?

12:05.876 --> 12:07.443
You know what, John?

12:07.699 --> 12:09.616
It's good to see you doing so well.

12:09.747 --> 12:11.045
Really, it is.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.377
Give my regards to the boys at the Plaza.

12:13.412 --> 12:15.234
Listen, you don't want to
give that to Jimmy, fine.

12:15.269 --> 12:21.959
But just tell him I
said... hello, and I'm back.

12:21.994 --> 12:23.455
Oh, if Jimmy wants to get in touch,

12:23.502 --> 12:25.998
he'll find you. Trust me.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.398
You ought to come over to dinner sometime.

12:28.526 --> 12:30.862
Mary and the kids would love to see you.

12:32.283 --> 12:33.714
Robert, how are things?

12:33.749 --> 12:34.314
How are you, Senator?

12:34.349 --> 12:35.917
Good to see you.

12:44.584 --> 12:47.195
Oh, there she is.

12:47.254 --> 12:49.584
Agent Marianne.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.731
Hands where I can see 'em.

12:53.068 --> 12:55.096
Looks good. You're making progress.

12:55.131 --> 12:57.125
Well, thank you, Agent Connolly.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.450
Did you save Boston yet?

12:58.485 --> 12:59.833
[grumbles]

12:59.868 --> 13:01.880
It's early, but I'm working on it.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.332
You better work hard, because
Hoover's expecting big things

13:04.400 --> 13:06.502
from his favorite son.

13:07.609 --> 13:08.867
He won't be disappointed.

13:08.902 --> 13:09.804
Oh, is that so?

13:09.839 --> 13:11.842
[laughs]

13:14.078 --> 13:16.549
[siren wails]

13:23.829 --> 13:26.289
Hey, little thief.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.085
What are you doing? I know what you want.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.524
- Jimmy? Is that you?
- What you looking for?

13:32.650 --> 13:34.129
Good morning, Ma.

13:34.961 --> 13:36.620
How was work?

13:36.707 --> 13:39.482
It was long. I got to get
some sleep, sweetheart.

13:39.842 --> 13:40.943
How we doin', huh?

13:40.978 --> 13:43.043
All right, hey.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.917
You still owe me $56.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.640
What do you say? Hmm?

13:47.675 --> 13:49.485
All right, one hand, huh?

13:49.520 --> 13:50.801
- One hand.
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

13:50.836 --> 13:53.730
And $56 is still a lot of money, Jimmy.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.279
Oh, don't I know it.

13:55.314 --> 13:57.169
You gonna cheat me again
or you gonna play straight?

13:57.204 --> 14:00.498
Ah, look who's talkin'. Cheat.

14:00.552 --> 14:03.718
Ah, Jimmy... get the jacket off.

14:03.792 --> 14:04.850
Here we go.

14:22.706 --> 14:23.995
Gin.

14:24.069 --> 14:26.361
Come on! Not again.

14:26.556 --> 14:29.216
You're not paying attention.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.320
Can't you see I'm after hearts?

14:31.355 --> 14:34.298
And you just keep feeding me hearts!

14:34.333 --> 14:35.777
Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.

14:35.812 --> 14:36.542
Better you than me, pal.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.519
Did you learn nothing in prison?

14:38.587 --> 14:42.230
Oh, all those hours and no
one taught you how to play gin.

14:42.283 --> 14:45.433
Well, they didn't teach me
how to cheat against my mom.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.958
Look, here's my cards. Count 'em out.

14:48.038 --> 14:51.868
Hey, Ma, did you know old Mother
Burke died over on Baker Street?

14:51.919 --> 14:53.810
No one found her for a couple of weeks.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.245
That's right.

14:55.279 --> 14:57.280
And when they broke down the door,

14:57.332 --> 15:00.473
her cats had devoured the best part of her.

15:01.697 --> 15:04.340
That's... that's beautiful, Ma.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.354
Who's hungry?

15:05.389 --> 15:08.128
I'm out. I got creamed,
I'm going to take a nap.

15:08.163 --> 15:09.503
Thanks for cheating, Ma.

15:09.557 --> 15:11.359
See you later.

15:12.772 --> 15:14.932
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

15:14.967 --> 15:17.569
Do you remember little John Connolly?

15:17.604 --> 15:18.648
Yeah, why? What's up?

15:18.683 --> 15:22.020
He's an FBI agent now. He's come back home.

15:22.112 --> 15:24.214
[horn honks]

15:25.212 --> 15:27.309

15:29.818 --> 15:31.520

15:31.697 --> 15:33.073

15:38.124 --> 15:39.068
_

15:39.103 --> 15:41.689
[telephone rings]

15:45.561 --> 15:47.009
Connolly.

15:50.479 --> 15:51.897
I'm on my way.

16:30.384 --> 16:33.946
Hey, Jimmy. It's good to see you.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.756
The fuckin' FBI, John?

16:40.795 --> 16:42.886
You got two minutes.

16:43.446 --> 16:45.626
All right, I'm gonna cut right to it.

16:47.437 --> 16:49.825
I... I have it on very good authority

16:49.860 --> 16:54.382
that Gennaro Angiulo is
planning to have you murdered.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.374
Is that so?

16:57.188 --> 16:59.701
And how does he plan to achieve that?

16:59.883 --> 17:03.837
That's the kind of
information that my side gets.

17:03.975 --> 17:07.195
And that's the kind of
information that we can provide.

17:07.382 --> 17:09.157
John, do you know what I do to rats?

17:09.193 --> 17:11.596
It ain't rattin', Jimmy.

17:11.648 --> 17:13.016
It's an alliance.

17:13.063 --> 17:16.079
An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?

17:16.115 --> 17:19.219
No, no, between you and me.

17:20.657 --> 17:24.344
I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.957
Listen, the whole fucking game has changed.

17:28.063 --> 17:30.479
And I'm not trying to clean up Southie.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.166
Fuck that! I fuckin' love this place.

17:34.292 --> 17:36.513
I'm interested in the North End

17:36.548 --> 17:39.286
and taking down the fuckin' WOPs.

17:39.394 --> 17:42.765
I'm interested in the Mafia,
and I bet you are, too.

17:48.726 --> 17:50.097
That's two minutes.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.222
Just think about it, will you?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.190
[engine turns over]

18:31.819 --> 18:32.875
Hi.

18:35.431 --> 18:39.381
Here she is, Miss America.

18:42.598 --> 18:44.872
And don't we look beautiful today.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.389
[chuckles]

18:49.585 --> 18:51.502
Where's my boy, sleeping upstairs?

18:51.537 --> 18:52.122
Yeah.

18:52.157 --> 18:54.139
- Should I wake him up?
- No.

18:54.207 --> 18:55.702
- You don't want me to wake him up?
- No!

18:55.737 --> 18:57.368
You sore at me?

18:57.403 --> 18:58.380
Jimmy, don't wake him up.

18:58.415 --> 19:01.048
I'll be sore if you wake him up.

19:01.116 --> 19:02.563
I'm gonna go wake him up now.

19:02.634 --> 19:04.820
- Don't wake him up.
- Wakin' him up.

19:25.502 --> 19:28.726
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.

19:30.238 --> 19:33.959
What are you gonna do
with the rest of that?

19:34.032 --> 19:35.392
Not drink it.

19:35.432 --> 19:38.121
No, buddy, you got to
drink every drop of that.

19:38.156 --> 19:39.673
You know why?

19:39.739 --> 19:42.487
That is pure vitamin C,

19:42.522 --> 19:45.179
and it's freshly squeezed by your mommy,

19:45.220 --> 19:49.837
which is, obviously, makes it
more special, even magical-like.

19:49.872 --> 19:53.538
It's true. Go on. Put it away.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.474
Good boy.

19:57.754 --> 19:59.085
So...

20:01.659 --> 20:03.781
do you feel like, maybe,
you want to tell me

20:03.816 --> 20:06.103
what happened in school yesterday?

20:13.981 --> 20:16.930
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.

20:16.996 --> 20:18.903
Yeah? What happened?

20:18.999 --> 20:22.742
Timmy. He's the kid who's
always trying to trip me.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.998
And he stole my coloring
pencils off my desk

20:25.033 --> 20:26.766
when my back was turned.

20:26.832 --> 20:28.854
So I punched him in the face.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.051
Good boy.

20:30.086 --> 20:31.288
LINDSEY: Jimmy.

20:31.392 --> 20:32.617
Hey.

20:32.653 --> 20:34.315
Let me ask you a question...

20:34.350 --> 20:36.075
is that why you think you got in trouble?

20:36.110 --> 20:38.667
'Cause you punched him in the face?

20:39.647 --> 20:40.517
All right.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.711
I need you to listen very
carefully to what I'm sayin'

20:42.746 --> 20:44.726
because there are lessons again and again

20:44.774 --> 20:46.887
throughout your whole life.

20:46.922 --> 20:49.724
You got to learn from these things, right?

20:49.789 --> 20:51.497
Here's the deal...

20:51.532 --> 20:54.299
you did not get in trouble

20:54.367 --> 20:56.845
because you punched this
sneaky brat in the face.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.144
Not at all.

20:58.179 --> 21:00.117
You got in trouble

21:00.215 --> 21:03.363
because you punched this
sneaky little brat in the face

21:03.398 --> 21:05.347
in front of other people.

21:05.382 --> 21:06.421
[sighs]

21:06.768 --> 21:08.312
Jimmy?

21:08.651 --> 21:10.226
I really don't think that
that's the right thing

21:10.283 --> 21:12.162
to be teaching your kid.

21:12.318 --> 21:17.686
No, that's absolutely what I
should be tellin' him, babe.

21:17.746 --> 21:20.717
So, the lesson you got to learn is this...

21:21.355 --> 21:22.977
it's not what you do,

21:23.039 --> 21:24.602
it's when and where you do it,

21:24.663 --> 21:28.556
and who you do it to or with.

21:28.661 --> 21:30.390
Huh? You follow?

21:30.444 --> 21:32.342
Yes, I follow.

21:32.439 --> 21:34.560
Punch people when no one's looking.

21:34.622 --> 21:37.090
- That's exactly right.
- [chuckles nervously]

21:37.125 --> 21:40.816
If nobody sees it,

21:40.971 --> 21:42.740
it didn't happen.

21:44.379 --> 21:47.011
[police radio chatter]

21:47.046 --> 21:50.085
[siren wails]

22:02.323 --> 22:04.515
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.

22:04.598 --> 22:06.910
Good afternoon, Officer Flynn.

22:06.997 --> 22:09.799
What happened? I must
have been doing 30 in a 25.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.571
Gonna lock me up for life or somethin'?

22:11.606 --> 22:12.919
TOMMY: Why don't you do your fucking job

22:12.973 --> 22:14.617
instead of trying to jerk off on
us, you pathetic fuckin' stiff?

22:14.652 --> 22:18.448
- All right, Tommy. Tommy!
- I'm doing my fuckin' job.

22:18.495 --> 22:21.558
I'm sure the officer
didn't stop us by accident.

22:21.645 --> 22:23.460
You wouldn't happen to
be carrying a message,

22:23.530 --> 22:25.059
now, would you?

22:25.120 --> 22:30.282
In fact, I am. Gerry
Angiulo sends his regards.

22:30.381 --> 22:32.373
Says he doesn't like finding
his boys beat to a pulp

22:32.439 --> 22:34.634
and left for dead in empty parking lots.

22:34.714 --> 22:35.416
He also said he's confident

22:35.451 --> 22:37.353
you ain't gonna cause him any more troubles

22:37.394 --> 22:40.554
'cause if you do, it's only gonna
cause much worse troubles for you.

22:40.608 --> 22:41.927
Listen, motherfucker.

22:41.962 --> 22:43.569
You think 'cause you're
wearing a fucking uniform,

22:43.604 --> 22:44.425
you can do what you want?

22:44.486 --> 22:46.416
- Go fuck yourself!
- Tommy!

22:46.463 --> 22:49.091
- Fuck you!
- Tommy, close the fucking door.

22:49.457 --> 22:51.766
I got to tell you something, Officer Flynn.

22:51.801 --> 22:54.787
It's a sad day when a native son

22:54.848 --> 22:56.754
takes up with his oppressor.

22:56.802 --> 22:59.749
There's a word for that
back home, you know.

22:59.906 --> 23:01.607
Penalty's death.

23:01.767 --> 23:03.173
You threatenin' me, Bulger?

23:03.208 --> 23:05.865
The last thing I would do
if I was planning to harm you

23:05.900 --> 23:08.412
is to warn you in advance, you dumb fuck.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.050
You better watch yourself, Bulger.

23:10.085 --> 23:11.715
You better fuck yourself, Flynn.

23:11.750 --> 23:15.387
Fuck you, you project rat.
And fuck you, you rummy.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.773
_

23:27.524 --> 23:30.365
TOMMY: I never trusted
Flynn. He's a fucking prick.

23:30.511 --> 23:31.585
LEONARD: Take it easy, will you?

23:31.620 --> 23:34.087
Even as kids, he was a fuckin' prick!

23:34.122 --> 23:35.430
A fuckin' prick.

23:35.465 --> 23:36.936
Please, calm down.

23:37.056 --> 23:39.214
Swear to God, I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

23:39.249 --> 23:40.608
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.

23:40.643 --> 23:42.804
Take it easy, will you?

23:42.873 --> 23:45.181
Cock-sucking, turncoat motherfucker.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.341
He's fucking dead!

23:46.412 --> 23:48.274
JIMMY: You're not fuckin'
killing anybody, Tommy,

23:48.335 --> 23:50.688
and you ain't killing a cop any time.

23:50.723 --> 23:51.925
You hear me?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.664
Fuck you, Whitey.

23:56.699 --> 23:58.886
Oh, Jesus. Tommy...

23:58.921 --> 24:02.015
- Go fuck yourself.
- Come on. Enough.

24:02.075 --> 24:03.980
Huh?

24:04.159 --> 24:04.723
Fuck you.

24:04.758 --> 24:06.571
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.

24:06.631 --> 24:08.567
You want to take a shot, Tommy?

24:08.617 --> 24:10.506
- Enough.
- Take your shot.

24:10.559 --> 24:11.635
But make it your fucking best,

24:11.670 --> 24:13.258
'cause I get up, I eat you.

24:13.344 --> 24:15.185
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Let's go. Come on.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.757
Relax. Jimmy, he's shit-faced.

24:16.797 --> 24:18.158
- I'll deal with him.
- Fuckin' better.

24:18.193 --> 24:20.740
- Don't even worry about it.
- What, you think I look fucking worried?

24:20.903 --> 24:21.496

24:28.851 --> 24:30.209
Hey, Tommy.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.418
Yeah?

24:31.452 --> 24:33.503
You watch yourself.

24:37.136 --> 24:38.003
OLSEN: Mr. Martorano,

24:38.038 --> 24:41.047
you are one of the most
feared men in Boston

24:41.147 --> 24:43.517
and well-known as the chief executioner

24:43.552 --> 24:45.197
for the Winter Hill Gang.

24:45.232 --> 24:46.776
Is that correct?

24:46.942 --> 24:47.997
Yes.

24:48.043 --> 24:52.860
You are also reputed to
have murdered some 20 people.

24:53.038 --> 24:55.011
Would you say that is accurate?

24:55.099 --> 24:57.462
That is accurate, yes.

24:57.642 --> 25:00.720
Mr. Martorano, I want you
to be as specific as possible

25:00.795 --> 25:03.998
in answering why the
war between the Angiulos

25:04.145 --> 25:06.641
and Winter Hill escalated.

25:06.754 --> 25:09.148
Simple. Territory.

25:09.183 --> 25:11.462
Specifically South Boston?

25:11.575 --> 25:13.499
Yes, Southie.

25:14.524 --> 25:16.623
Angiulo wanted to control everything...

25:16.684 --> 25:20.252
loan-sharking, vending
machines, all the rackets.

25:20.605 --> 25:22.970
And there were consequences.

25:23.147 --> 25:23.873
Yeah.

25:23.934 --> 25:25.388
There was consequences.

25:27.379 --> 25:28.455

25:52.907 --> 25:55.733
Suitcase? The fuck did he do?

25:56.662 --> 25:58.600
He set up Mickey.

25:59.364 --> 26:01.068
Fuck me.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.213
Hang on a minute.

26:04.508 --> 26:06.116
Hey, what's going on, Jimmy?

26:07.363 --> 26:08.542
You guys looking for Suitcase?

26:08.577 --> 26:10.475

Hill a few hours ago.

26:10.510 --> 26:11.853

Nah, we got it, buddy.

26:49.775 --> 26:50.883

26:50.918 --> 26:53.798
I was... I was fucking way out of line.

26:53.855 --> 26:56.118
Forget about it, Tommy. You was drunk.

26:56.205 --> 26:59.484
I know I was drunk, but
that ain't an excuse.

26:59.519 --> 27:00.342
Should never have fuckin' happened.

27:00.390 --> 27:01.978
No, it should never have happened.

27:02.013 --> 27:03.760
But that's the thing.

27:03.855 --> 27:06.097
I want you to listen to me.

27:06.165 --> 27:08.562

- Yeah.

27:08.597 --> 27:10.725
Because, you know, the juice,

27:10.780 --> 27:12.525
it'll sneak up and bite you on the ass,

27:12.601 --> 27:14.531

you know what I mean?

27:14.566 --> 27:18.378

27:43.693 --> 27:44.711
WEEKS: I think Jim was convinced

27:44.751 --> 27:47.535
that Tommy ratted out Mickey to Angiulo.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.274
Either that or Tommy
raising a fist to Jimmy,

27:50.309 --> 27:53.182
which is never a good idea.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.927
Where'd they bury him?

27:55.019 --> 27:57.516
In Jim's favorite spot.

27:57.586 --> 28:00.489
Right there under the
bridge in Neponset River.

28:01.905 --> 28:04.058
He buried so many bodies in that shithole,

28:04.140 --> 28:08.773
it became known as the
Bulger Burial Ground.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.075
I don't know how you fuckers didn't get it.

28:13.229 --> 28:15.860
I really don't. I mean, in the beginning,

28:15.979 --> 28:17.376
Jim was a small-town player

28:17.417 --> 28:20.203
who really only mattered in Southie.

28:20.377 --> 28:22.619
Don't get me wrong... he
was a tough motherfucker,

28:22.654 --> 28:25.510
but small-time.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.692
And then the next thing you
know, he's a goddamn kingpin.

28:29.035 --> 28:30.627
You know why?

28:31.420 --> 28:33.467
Because the FBI let it happen.

28:48.445 --> 28:51.072
CONNOLLY: This is potentially
the biggest opportunity

28:51.107 --> 28:52.609
the Bureau will ever have had

28:52.681 --> 28:54.954
in the history of the city of Boston,

28:54.989 --> 28:56.494
and you need time to think about it?

28:56.529 --> 28:59.395
Before you go flying any
further off the handle,

28:59.443 --> 29:03.504
it might help to recall that
Whitey Bulger is an ex-convict

29:03.571 --> 29:06.813
and that his parole category
is "supervised released status,"

29:06.848 --> 29:09.725
a designation that we would
be required to get withdrawn

29:09.760 --> 29:12.817
or else we would be in
violation of Bureau regulations.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.200
So? We withdraw or we violate.

29:15.235 --> 29:17.904
What we don't do, unless
we're clinically insane,

29:17.939 --> 29:20.054
is blow this chance!

29:20.856 --> 29:23.827
By the way, it's "Jimmy," not "Whitey."

29:23.862 --> 29:24.726
The only thing you're gonna get

29:24.761 --> 29:27.115
by calling him Whitey is a fucking smack.

29:27.150 --> 29:28.518
Oh, is that so?

29:28.618 --> 29:31.028
So I'm supposed to cater
to this fucker's whims?

29:31.063 --> 29:33.441
If it brings you Angiulo, yes!

29:33.496 --> 29:35.737
And what makes you so sure

29:35.786 --> 29:37.283
that he's gonna be a reliable source?

29:37.318 --> 29:38.668
Because in my experience,

29:38.703 --> 29:39.987
everyone of those Winter Hill pricks

29:40.022 --> 29:42.103
is a double-crossing cocksucker.

29:42.205 --> 29:44.311
I grew up with him in Southie.

29:44.638 --> 29:47.902
Jimmy, his brother Billy, and me.

29:47.949 --> 29:51.596
And that is a bond that doesn't get broken.

29:51.864 --> 29:54.777
I mean, if he gives me
his word, he will keep it.

29:54.831 --> 29:57.280
So we're relying on the word of criminals.

29:57.313 --> 29:59.233
Jimmy's no ordinary criminal.

29:59.283 --> 30:01.115
Well, you're right about that.

"A vicious animal who won't
take no for an answer."

30:04.662 --> 30:08.106

at any hint of betrayal."

to succeed above all else."

30:12.546 --> 30:14.369

bringing down the Italians,

30:34.629 --> 30:36.286
Jimmy is the only way.

30:36.319 --> 30:38.453
What about these LSD experiments in prison?

30:38.488 --> 30:39.706
He can't be stable.

30:39.741 --> 30:41.483
He did it for time off and money.

30:41.518 --> 30:42.968
And it was a handful of times.

30:43.029 --> 30:45.503
It was 50 times, John.

to gain than to lose on this.

connections in the FBI.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.585
I knew he had his sources.

No. There's informing, and
then there's <i>informing.</i>

in five minutes, you hear?

36:56.564 --> 36:57.557
GIRL: Can we open presents?

36:57.598 --> 36:59.602
Open presents, right.

37:00.346 --> 37:02.619
Whose turn is it first?

37:03.444 --> 37:04.513
That was you?

37:04.606 --> 37:06.026
I don't know how

37:06.061 --> 37:07.843
- your brother does it.
- [telephone rings]

37:07.878 --> 37:08.622
What's that?

37:08.657 --> 37:10.559
Nine children.

37:11.015 --> 37:11.807
Oh.

37:11.938 --> 37:15.538
That's a complete mystery to me, as well.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.737
Hello?

37:18.007 --> 37:20.680
Hey, Stevie. I just wanted to say...

37:20.715 --> 37:22.178
I can't understand... calm down.

37:22.213 --> 37:25.875
It's really good that you're comin' along.

37:25.946 --> 37:29.032
It makes things in my world a lot easier.

37:29.064 --> 37:29.905
BILLY: All right, all right.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.392
- Sure, John.
- Hold on, hold on.

37:33.795 --> 37:35.618
Jimmy, phone.

37:36.156 --> 37:37.379
What?

37:37.585 --> 37:39.688
You need to take the call.

37:44.592 --> 37:46.428
[elevator bell dings]

37:48.556 --> 37:51.669
Excuse me. Douglas Cyr's room, please.

37:51.915 --> 37:53.514
Room 508, around the corner.

37:53.549 --> 37:55.164
Thank you.

37:56.535 --> 37:57.860
How is he?

37:57.924 --> 37:59.828
He's in there right now with the doctor,

37:59.863 --> 38:01.785
and they're saying that
it's Reye's syndrome.

38:01.820 --> 38:03.359
What the fuck is Reye's syndrome?

38:03.394 --> 38:05.089
- I thought it was the flu.
- [crying] I know, so did I.

38:05.124 --> 38:07.001
But then when you left,
I called the doctor,

38:07.036 --> 38:08.992
and they said to just
keep giving him aspirin

38:09.040 --> 38:11.498
every four hours, just like
I'd been doing for days.

38:11.533 --> 38:12.871
But then his fever got higher,

38:12.906 --> 38:16.717
and then... and then his
behavior started changing,

38:16.752 --> 38:19.013
and he became really angry to me.

38:19.048 --> 38:20.347
Okay.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.940
Like, really angry, and
his body was all stiff,

38:23.975 --> 38:25.266
so I brought him here, and they said

38:25.301 --> 38:29.893
that the aspirin that I had been
giving him just made him worse.

38:30.180 --> 38:32.156
- No. No.
- Yeah, that's what they said!

38:32.191 --> 38:35.140
That's what they said...
that I made him worse.

38:52.515 --> 38:54.826
Sorry, no change.

39:02.821 --> 39:04.880
I'm taking him home, Lindsey.

39:05.362 --> 39:07.411
I don't fucking care what they say.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.634
I want to take my boy home.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.586
He's not coming home, Jimmy.

39:11.621 --> 39:15.956
Don't say that, please. Don't say that.

39:21.925 --> 39:24.882
He's on life support, Jimmy.
He's not going anywhere.

39:24.969 --> 39:26.743
You got to accept it.

39:26.891 --> 39:30.025
[scoffs] I don't got to do fucking nothing.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.259
Look at me.

39:36.193 --> 39:37.910
Jimmy, please look at me.

39:37.945 --> 39:39.995
[sniffles]

39:41.238 --> 39:44.920
He's never gonna be our
little boy again, never.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.015
Don't.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.450
- He's brain-dead.
- Don't say that.

39:47.482 --> 39:50.365
He's on life support, he can't move,

39:50.400 --> 39:52.625
and I don't want him like that!

39:53.048 --> 39:55.634
I can't have my little boy be like that!

39:55.669 --> 39:57.005
[sighs]

40:00.834 --> 40:02.357
[sniffles]

40:03.952 --> 40:05.988
I'll pull the plug myself.

40:06.194 --> 40:07.813
I will.

40:12.848 --> 40:14.449
What did you say?

40:23.209 --> 40:26.012
What the fuck did you just say?

40:28.055 --> 40:29.924
My boy?

40:31.439 --> 40:34.597
You pull the plug on my boy?

40:34.848 --> 40:37.685
I can't have him like this, Jimmy.

40:40.847 --> 40:43.044
- How could you be so cold?
- Don't say that to me.

40:43.079 --> 40:45.506
- How could you be so cold?
- Don't say that.

40:45.563 --> 40:46.606
I could never, ever.

40:46.641 --> 40:48.920
- Don't you dare fucking say that.
- You're pathetic.

40:48.955 --> 40:50.884
You of all people in
the whole fucking world

40:50.932 --> 40:54.118
- cannot say that to me!
- Who the fuck are you?

40:54.672 --> 40:56.921
You motherfucker.

40:57.590 --> 40:59.894
Go fuck yourself.

41:04.012 --> 41:06.600
[waste can rattles]

41:06.635 --> 41:10.507
[footsteps depart]

42:01.044 --> 42:02.665
OLSEN: Because you have been convicted

42:02.727 --> 42:05.528
of federal racketeering and murder charges

42:05.563 --> 42:08.796
and aim to make a deal to spare your life,

42:08.864 --> 42:11.884
I'd like to start with the
period of Mr. Bulger's life

42:11.951 --> 42:13.641
after the death of his son,

42:13.676 --> 42:14.976
when his enterprise expanded

42:15.044 --> 42:19.705
and he became a so-called
"crime lord" of Boston.

42:24.451 --> 42:26.071
Okay.

42:36.552 --> 42:40.034
From what were you and Mr.
Bulger making your money?

42:40.590 --> 42:42.297
Ah, it was a lot of things...

42:42.332 --> 42:44.412
running dope on the streets of Southie.

42:44.445 --> 42:47.823
We had the rackets. We had the ponies.

42:48.017 --> 42:49.487
Tenants on every corner.

42:49.556 --> 42:51.056
This ain't your neighborhood, Whitey.

42:51.091 --> 42:52.493
Is that right?

42:52.638 --> 42:55.482
FLEMMI: But we were
making weekly collections.

42:55.557 --> 42:56.817
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

42:56.932 --> 42:59.850
You name it, and yeah, we was doin' it.

43:00.297 --> 43:01.645
BILLY: The lottery, Jimmy?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.693
- _
- JIMMY: What can I tell you, Billy boy?

43:03.728 --> 43:05.705
I went in on a ticket as a lark,

43:05.740 --> 43:08.696
and I fucking won, fair and square. What?

43:08.731 --> 43:11.373
Would you say Winter Hill was thriving?

43:11.485 --> 43:13.269
We were making a lot of money.

43:13.332 --> 43:15.964
Which meant we had to
pay off a lot of people,

43:16.066 --> 43:18.282
keep things running smooth, you know?

43:18.317 --> 43:21.851
Local street cops, Feds, whatever.

43:21.886 --> 43:24.535
We were throwing money around like crazy.

43:24.588 --> 43:26.728
And then there was those trips to Miami.

43:26.763 --> 43:29.366
We were getting into the jai alai racket

43:29.433 --> 43:30.695
with John Callahan

43:30.730 --> 43:33.900
and an individual named Brian Halloran.

43:34.175 --> 43:36.652
Jimmy never really trusted him.

43:36.687 --> 43:39.257
I swear to God, I'll shoot
youse both in the face.

43:39.666 --> 43:40.666
[woman screams]

43:40.869 --> 43:43.190
For obvious reasons.

43:44.403 --> 43:47.315
But he didn't think he could
make the deal without him.

43:47.421 --> 43:48.237
So...

43:48.281 --> 43:50.053
MCGUIRE: Right now,
Connolly, Bulger and his crew

43:50.107 --> 43:51.634
are swanning around Southie

43:51.669 --> 43:53.823
like a bunch of fucking
Vikings, raping and pillaging,

43:53.877 --> 43:56.709
and we can't touch them because
they're no longer criminals.

43:56.776 --> 43:59.596
They're professional criminal consultants.

43:59.664 --> 44:00.931
But my question to you is,

44:00.966 --> 44:03.621
have they actually given us
one concrete fucking thing

44:03.656 --> 44:04.478
that we can move on?

44:04.513 --> 44:05.604
Just give me a fucking break!

44:05.639 --> 44:07.934
After the desert you been walking through?

44:08.030 --> 44:09.932
This is your ticket to the big time.

44:09.998 --> 44:11.118
And all you can do is fucking bitch.

44:11.153 --> 44:13.243
All right, you fucking listen to me, John.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.426
We have given Bulger
miles and miles of leeway,

44:15.461 --> 44:18.584
and so far, he's given us dick in return.

44:18.717 --> 44:21.658
I need a wire inside
Angiulo's headquarters.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.135
That fucker's been moving around so much,

44:23.182 --> 44:25.417
I need to know specifically
where his fucking headquarters

44:25.452 --> 44:27.202
even are, and the fact that we don't

44:27.237 --> 44:29.823
makes us look like a bunch
of fucking Keystone Cops.

44:29.878 --> 44:31.546
I need evidence that I can present

44:31.581 --> 44:32.974
to the federal prosecutor.

44:33.009 --> 44:34.527
And you'll get it.

44:34.705 --> 44:36.556
You got two weeks.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.714
That's fucking it!

44:39.300 --> 44:41.120
Then I pull the plug.

44:48.479 --> 44:50.055
[door slams]

44:51.607 --> 44:54.062
JIMMY: Are you telling me that
your fucking boys at the Bureau

44:54.097 --> 44:55.997
can't find Angiulo's place?

44:56.032 --> 44:59.089
For fuck's sake, everyone in
Boston knows where the guy is!

44:59.124 --> 45:01.791
The fucker keeps moving
all over the North End.

45:01.873 --> 45:03.573
I need specifics, Jimmy.

45:03.608 --> 45:07.163
Not tomorrow, not next week... now. Today.

45:07.250 --> 45:10.938
I need to get a wire inside
Angiulo's headquarters,

45:10.999 --> 45:13.210
or I can't keep protecting you.

45:13.474 --> 45:15.283
It's that simple.

45:18.676 --> 45:20.033
All right.

45:20.348 --> 45:23.382
But I need you to do something for me.

45:24.154 --> 45:25.808
You want a fucking wiretap or not?

45:25.843 --> 45:28.465
Jesus, Jimmy. Jimmy.

45:29.904 --> 45:30.525
[sighs]

45:30.560 --> 45:32.750
I want all of Angiulo's vending machines

45:32.805 --> 45:34.053
out of the Old Colony.

45:34.088 --> 45:37.279
I don't care how you do
it. I just want 'em gone.

45:37.372 --> 45:39.274
Do you follow?

45:41.115 --> 45:43.277
Do you fucking follow?

45:49.063 --> 45:50.913
All right, then.

45:51.059 --> 45:54.143
When you leave for work tomorrow morning,

45:54.310 --> 45:58.541
after you've gone for your
jog down Silver Street...

45:58.772 --> 46:03.099
after you stopped at McNulty's
for a black coffee and a Danish,

46:03.496 --> 46:05.879
after you read the Sports page,

46:05.914 --> 46:08.159
after you kissed Marianne goodbye,

46:08.194 --> 46:11.424
you walk straight out
your door to your car,

46:11.504 --> 46:13.406
which is parked in the same fuckin' spot

46:13.441 --> 46:15.448
it's always parked in...

46:16.504 --> 46:19.707
right before you put your
keys into the ignition,

46:20.014 --> 46:22.950
maybe have a look in the glove box.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.433
There just might be an
early Christmas present

46:28.468 --> 46:30.281
in there for you.

46:46.014 --> 46:47.115
What's this?

46:47.222 --> 46:49.523
Gentlemen, this is intel,

46:49.558 --> 46:52.222
from our source in Winter Hill.

46:54.617 --> 46:55.752
FITZPATRICK: Holy shit.

46:55.787 --> 46:57.732
98 Prince Street.

46:57.870 --> 47:00.268
Angiulo Family headquarters.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.217
Fuck me.

47:01.252 --> 47:04.406
Yeah, "fuck me" and fuck you is right.

47:04.679 --> 47:08.204
An hour ago, I got a
wet shave in a barbershop

47:08.239 --> 47:11.904
right across from 98 Prince
in the heart of the North End,

47:11.998 --> 47:15.825
and within 15 minutes, I saw Mikey Angiulo,

47:15.889 --> 47:19.415
Bobby Carozza, and one
Vincent "The Animal" Ferrara

47:19.450 --> 47:21.748
- all go inside.
- Jesus, John.

47:21.783 --> 47:25.520
Do you want to talk about
who's a valuable asset, Charles?

47:25.745 --> 47:27.378
In five fucking years of nobodies

47:27.439 --> 47:29.606
with Scotch on their
breath giving us shit...

47:29.641 --> 47:31.280
not a goddamn thing.

47:31.315 --> 47:32.822
And giving them 40 bucks
to go around the corner

47:32.857 --> 47:34.250
and get drunk and dick us around?

47:34.311 --> 47:36.586
Fuck that. This, on the other hand,

47:36.652 --> 47:38.076
is the kind of intel we get

47:38.111 --> 47:42.147
from James "Whitey" Bulger, gentlemen.

47:42.282 --> 47:44.100
No one else.

48:02.763 --> 48:05.074
FLEMMI: Jimmy always had a plan.

48:07.161 --> 48:11.033
Like him giving up Angiulo's
address at 98 Prince Street.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.535
Now, that was a smart play

48:13.570 --> 48:19.766
because it kept Connolly,
you know, off our backs.

48:20.099 --> 48:22.461
We had stuff going on in Florida.

48:22.628 --> 48:24.844
Situation down there was changing,

48:24.919 --> 48:27.051
and not for the better.

48:27.420 --> 48:30.256
CHAIRMAN: World Jai Alai would
like to introduce its new owner,

48:30.323 --> 48:34.331
C.E.O. and Chief Operating
Officer Roger Wheeler.

48:34.385 --> 48:36.684
- Roger?
- Thank you, Alan.

48:36.879 --> 48:38.833
It's an exciting time for Jai Alai,

48:38.898 --> 48:40.749
and I'm honored to be part of its growth

48:40.800 --> 48:43.154
and expansion here in South Florida.

48:43.275 --> 48:46.982
John Callahan has us
poised for great success.

48:48.061 --> 48:50.516
FLEMMI: I can't believe
people pay to watch this shit.

48:50.598 --> 48:52.523
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.

48:52.588 --> 48:54.454
They fucking love to bet on it.

48:54.489 --> 48:56.478
That's making us very rich.

48:56.618 --> 48:59.179
But who knows for how much
longer with Wheeler moving in?

48:59.247 --> 49:01.897
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.

49:01.954 --> 49:03.895
But at least we still got this.

49:03.977 --> 49:06.184
Oh, no, no, no. You give
that to Kevin, not me.

49:06.219 --> 49:07.436
All right.

49:10.903 --> 49:13.241
FLEMMI: So, what's the
problem with this Wheeler guy?

49:13.329 --> 49:14.329
What's his deal?

49:14.354 --> 49:17.626
He's got CPAs crawling all up my ass,

49:17.678 --> 49:20.106
all over the books,
checking every fucking thing.

49:20.141 --> 49:23.165
The cash flow, the free meals,
the parking-lot receipts.

49:23.265 --> 49:25.151
Just a matter of time before he finds out

49:25.213 --> 49:26.611
how much cash is missing.

49:26.691 --> 49:29.043
Just make him an offer for the company.

49:29.078 --> 49:31.295
Tried. Won't sell.

49:31.525 --> 49:33.685
Would his widow sell?

49:37.968 --> 49:39.813
FLEMMI: Maybe she could be persuaded.

49:39.848 --> 49:43.704
Maybe balloonhead over here...
you could do us a favor.

49:43.739 --> 49:45.805
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

49:45.965 --> 49:46.802
Sure.

49:46.837 --> 49:48.537
Whatever you say, Stevie.

49:48.570 --> 49:50.633
But, you know, there
must be some other way.

49:50.701 --> 49:52.276
Yeah, but you don't get rid of him,

49:52.344 --> 49:54.466
how's he supposed to go away?

49:54.612 --> 49:56.990
What's the downside of this thing, John?

49:57.025 --> 49:58.806
There is no downside, Stevie.

49:58.841 --> 50:02.239
And the upside is, we get our
cut and keep printing money.

50:02.376 --> 50:03.451
I mean, what's to connect you

50:03.485 --> 50:05.089
to anything that happens to Wheeler?

50:05.150 --> 50:07.891
He lives in Tulsa, for fuck's sake!

50:09.048 --> 50:12.668
Everybody knows we have World Jai Alai.

50:12.703 --> 50:14.284
Who's "everybody"?

50:14.319 --> 50:16.483
We're fucking everybody.

50:16.950 --> 50:18.287
Brian.

50:19.526 --> 50:21.895
Take the bag. I want you to have it.

50:24.506 --> 50:26.926
Yeah. I want you to have it.

50:27.219 --> 50:28.264
No.

50:28.299 --> 50:29.623
Lot of money in that bag, Jimmy.

50:29.684 --> 50:32.378
I know exactly how much
money's in that fucking bag.

50:32.413 --> 50:35.650
Brian, take the bag and get out of here.

50:36.828 --> 50:39.131
To do the hit on... on Wheeler?

50:39.177 --> 50:40.185
No.

50:40.220 --> 50:45.761
That's $20,000 for you
to <i>not</i> do the hit.

50:46.294 --> 50:47.527
[chuckles]

50:48.922 --> 50:50.404
I don't get it.

50:50.499 --> 50:52.401
Take the money, keep
your fucking mouth shut

50:52.434 --> 50:53.876
about what you just heard.

50:53.911 --> 50:57.293
It's best you're not involved.
Take the fucking money.

50:57.328 --> 51:01.264
Take the fucking money.
Take the fucking money.

51:02.590 --> 51:04.321
Okay.

51:06.346 --> 51:07.588
Um...

51:09.368 --> 51:11.593
so I should go now?

51:11.790 --> 51:14.101
Yeah, you should go now.

51:14.140 --> 51:16.009
[laughs]

51:17.826 --> 51:19.390
Thank you.

51:19.526 --> 51:21.529
You're welcome.

51:27.971 --> 51:30.020
Listen, I know you guys have your ways

51:30.055 --> 51:31.885
and everything like that, don't you?

51:31.920 --> 51:35.834
But don't ever hand me a bag
of fucking money in public.

51:35.933 --> 51:38.647
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I just, I thought that...

51:38.719 --> 51:40.814
No, I know. I get it. It's all right.

51:40.849 --> 51:42.895
Don't sweat it. But I mean...

51:44.690 --> 51:45.983
All right.

51:46.096 --> 51:47.389
Never again.

51:47.458 --> 51:50.831
But we're good with Wheeler, right?

51:50.866 --> 51:53.236
[chuckles]

52:06.726 --> 52:08.148
MAN: Afternoon, Mr. Wheeler!

52:08.183 --> 52:09.505
Howdy.

52:33.492 --> 52:34.849
Roger Wheeler?

52:34.884 --> 52:37.472

GENNARO: <i>What the fuck
is this jai alai thing</i>

52:45.289 --> 52:48.307
<i>that Whitey's got his
fingers into all of a sudden?</i>

52:48.342 --> 52:49.710
<i>What is this bullshit?</i>

52:49.765 --> 52:51.468
MAN: <i>That's the word on the street.</i>

52:51.543 --> 52:53.791
<i>Looks like a stupid
fucking game, you ask me.</i>

52:53.826 --> 52:55.355
<i>Yeah, well, I'll tell ya.</i>

52:55.390 --> 52:56.904
<i>I don't picture Bulger
going all the way</i>

52:56.939 --> 52:59.357
<i>out to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to kill somebody.</i>

52:59.417 --> 53:01.873
<i>But then again, he's
such a sick little fuck.</i>

53:01.908 --> 53:04.750
<i>And that stupid half-breed
buddy of his, Flemmi.</i>

53:04.798 --> 53:06.896
<i>The two of them, they'll
go anywhere, anytime</i>

53:06.972 --> 53:10.300
<i>and whack anybody out if there's
a few bucks in it for them.</i>

53:10.335 --> 53:12.734
MORRIS: I got to shut this
fucking thing down, John.

53:12.769 --> 53:15.309
Now we got people on tape

53:15.357 --> 53:18.520
talking about how Whitey
and Flemmi committed murder.

53:18.559 --> 53:21.050
That is a big fucking problem.

53:21.085 --> 53:24.608
That tape is just gangsters talking shit

53:24.643 --> 53:26.071
like little fucking housewives.

53:26.106 --> 53:28.166
Yeah, maybe. But I got
to tell you something.

53:28.201 --> 53:30.307
McGuire is gonna start asking questions.

53:30.355 --> 53:33.187
That is why I'm gonna file it very deep.

53:33.222 --> 53:35.711
All right? Problem gone.

53:35.746 --> 53:36.530
Gone.

53:36.565 --> 53:37.651
That's against protocol.

53:37.686 --> 53:39.422
Fuck protocol.

53:39.738 --> 53:40.858
Fuck it.

53:40.893 --> 53:41.786
It's a little lie,

53:41.827 --> 53:46.041
a little white lie to
protect the bigger truth.

53:46.196 --> 53:48.604
You know what Jimmy has given us.

53:48.679 --> 53:50.814
A gold mine.

53:51.889 --> 53:55.316
And do you want to be the
person that jeopardizes that?

53:55.478 --> 53:59.875
We are bringing down the house, man.

53:59.965 --> 54:02.111
La Cosa Nostra.

54:02.321 --> 54:04.590
So just relax.

54:05.260 --> 54:06.651
Relax.

54:07.249 --> 54:09.225
I'll handle it. It's on me.

54:09.323 --> 54:11.158
I got this.

54:16.566 --> 54:19.879
<i>Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
are still sifting through clues</i>

54:19.933 --> 54:23.351
<i>in the murder of Roger Wheeler,

<i>...for information leading

<i>...Wheeler's more controversial

What do you want, huh?

54:55.661 --> 54:57.063
[sniffs]

55:06.037 --> 55:08.635
This meeting between
Rizzo and Sal Manzinni.

55:08.670 --> 55:10.133
The walk-in in Interview 3

55:10.201 --> 55:13.004
says Whitey Bulger killed Roger Wheeler.

55:16.722 --> 55:19.539
Gentlemen, this is Brian Halloran.

55:19.672 --> 55:21.796
You have something you want to tell us?

55:21.831 --> 55:23.190
[door closes]

55:23.736 --> 55:26.431
There's a lot I can tell
you. I need guarantees first.

55:26.466 --> 55:28.776
CONNOLLY: Fuck you. You
don't get no guarantees.

55:28.809 --> 55:30.612
You talk or you walk.

55:33.706 --> 55:35.320
[sighs]

55:35.502 --> 55:37.104
Okay.

55:37.910 --> 55:41.494
Whitey Bulger planned
to murder Roger Wheeler,

55:41.559 --> 55:42.941
that jai alai dude from Tulsa.

55:42.976 --> 55:44.419
It's been on the news and everything.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.306
- Tulsa?
- Mm-hmm.

55:46.383 --> 55:51.081
Oh. So, what does some
random jai alai guy in Tulsa

55:51.144 --> 55:53.081
have to do with Whitey Bulger?

55:53.163 --> 55:55.298
Whitey was pulling down
some serious coin in jai alai

55:55.333 --> 55:56.850
until Wheeler bought the fucking thing,

55:56.885 --> 55:59.021
and he didn't want to
cut Whitey in for a piece.

55:59.056 --> 56:00.091
So...

56:00.277 --> 56:02.864
You two know anything about this?

56:02.950 --> 56:03.950
Psh.

56:04.510 --> 56:05.881
Go on.

56:07.265 --> 56:09.927
Bulger paid me 20 grand to
keep quiet about the hit.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.845
Listen, you got to protect me.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.068
'Cause if you don't, I'm fuckin' dead!

56:13.103 --> 56:15.181
What weapon was used on Wheeler?

56:15.248 --> 56:17.908
How should I know? I didn't do
the hit. Johnny Martorano did.

56:17.943 --> 56:19.569
How do you know it was Martorano?

56:19.604 --> 56:22.789
Look, I make my living
on the streets, okay?

56:22.824 --> 56:24.684
All right? I know these things.

56:24.752 --> 56:27.321
Hey, look! Look at me!
You got to protect me.

56:27.382 --> 56:29.768
Well, so far, you haven't given us anything

56:29.803 --> 56:31.292
to merit protection.

56:31.361 --> 56:32.803
Are you fuckin' deaf?

56:32.838 --> 56:34.533
I just gave you two fucking names!

56:34.568 --> 56:37.827
Where was this so-called
meeting taking place?

56:39.499 --> 56:40.908
You...

56:42.447 --> 56:44.625
All right, all right.

56:44.798 --> 56:46.183
Okay.

56:46.447 --> 56:48.788
I'm in Miami, I hear Jimmy's in town,

56:48.854 --> 56:50.981
and I tag along to a little spot

56:51.044 --> 56:53.301
with Steve Flemmi, Jimmy,

56:53.369 --> 56:56.891
and this other guy... guy, Callahan.

56:57.107 --> 56:58.720
And I'm just minding
my own fucking business,

56:58.755 --> 57:01.744
and then Callahan says
that he thinks that Wheeler

57:01.820 --> 57:02.984
is gonna be a problem.

57:03.065 --> 57:05.688
And then Jimmy says,

57:05.903 --> 57:07.429
"Do you think his widow would be willing

57:07.484 --> 57:09.525
- to sell the franchise?"
- His widow?

57:09.586 --> 57:11.917
Mm-hmm. We all know
what that means, right?

57:11.998 --> 57:14.768
And then Flemmi asked me
if I could take care of it.

57:15.687 --> 57:18.103
Would you take a lie detector?

57:18.218 --> 57:20.043
Okay.

57:20.111 --> 57:22.233
- Yeah?
- No.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.634
'Cause then you might start
asking me other questions.

57:24.669 --> 57:27.289
Right? And next thing I know, boom!

57:27.324 --> 57:29.865
You got me on like 15 other
things I didn't even do!

57:29.898 --> 57:32.952
"Boom"? What did you not do, Brian?

57:32.987 --> 57:36.524
Did you not kill your drug
dealers in a Chinese restaurant?

57:36.615 --> 57:38.366
'Cause that's why you're really here.

57:38.401 --> 57:40.015
That's all over the fucking street,

57:40.076 --> 57:41.851
so you thought you'd come in here

57:41.932 --> 57:44.308
and try and cop some
immunity before the fact.

57:44.343 --> 57:45.764
That's what's really going on, isn't it,

57:45.799 --> 57:47.684
you coke-snorting piece of shit?

57:47.765 --> 57:49.402
FITZPATRICK: Connolly?

57:52.311 --> 57:55.115
I'm a fuckin' dead man!

58:03.499 --> 58:04.706
What do you think?

58:04.741 --> 58:09.599
I don't believe a fucking
word that guy says.

58:10.205 --> 58:12.258
I say we cut him loose.

58:12.337 --> 58:14.369
He's a drug addict.

58:14.956 --> 58:16.266
Morris?

58:19.049 --> 58:20.221
Yeah.

58:20.380 --> 58:24.418
He won't take a polygraph? Cut him loose.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.825
Yeah.

- _

58:48.001 --> 58:49.172
the good people of Ireland.

58:49.207 --> 58:51.407
And, today... well, today,

58:51.442 --> 58:54.316
we Bostonians face a similar invasion.

58:54.355 --> 58:58.089
Drugs, violent crimes
ravaging our communities.

58:58.154 --> 59:00.689
You know, today we fight a new fight,

59:00.724 --> 59:04.518
a fight so our children and their children,

59:04.553 --> 59:06.505
and children for generations to come

59:06.573 --> 59:10.878
can share the Boston we
hold so dear in our hearts.

59:10.959 --> 59:15.282
So today, to all snakes, we say,
"Get the hell out of Boston!"

59:15.354 --> 59:17.866
"You'll find no shelter here!"

59:17.982 --> 59:20.006
To Saint Patrick!

Billy boy! Billy boy!

59:33.152 --> 59:35.024

59:41.456 --> 59:42.846
Jimmy! Where the fuck have you been?

59:42.906 --> 59:44.469
I been looking for you everywhere.

59:44.504 --> 59:46.673
Oh, hey. Come here with me.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.466
Come here.

59:48.747 --> 59:51.877
Don't you fucking <i>ever</i> talk
to me in public like that again.

59:51.938 --> 59:54.173
Did you kill Roger Wheeler?

59:55.242 --> 59:57.843
The businessman from Tulsa.
Did you have him killed?

59:57.878 --> 01:00:00.032
Why the fuck would I go to Tulsa

01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:04.219
to kill some fucking
prick I don't even know?

01:00:04.289 --> 01:00:05.919
That's bad for fuckin' business.

01:00:05.954 --> 01:00:09.455
I know that you have a
hand in the World Jai Alai.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:13.103
Huh? And suddenly, the new owner gets shot.

01:00:14.264 --> 01:00:16.962
I suggest you think these things through

01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:20.489
before you make unfounded
accusations against me.

01:00:20.524 --> 01:00:22.103
All right, all right.

01:00:23.056 --> 01:00:24.471
Just...

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.741
By the way, let me ask you a question.

01:00:30.035 --> 01:00:32.972
How did you know we was
involved in jai alai?

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:39.281

Happy Saint Patrick's Day. How are you?

01:01:00.361 --> 01:01:02.884
Everybody always commented
on my work, right.

01:01:02.919 --> 01:01:04.752
- Sure, they did.
- They did! They did!

01:01:04.826 --> 01:01:08.526
I was in the low post, I was driving
it in hard, like fuckin' McHale!

01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:09.190
How could you fuckin' take that?

01:01:09.225 --> 01:01:12.052
- I was!
- You got short arms!

01:01:12.087 --> 01:01:13.905
I don't got short arms.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.357
You know who had short arms?

01:01:16.558 --> 01:01:19.576
Nate "Tiny" Archibald had short arms.

01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:20.861
So there's hope.

Brian Halloran was just gunned
down in broad fucking daylight.

You want to tell me how the fuck
you just let him walk out the door?

We're not running a hotel, Charles.

01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:39.032
The guy wouldn't even
take a polygraph test.

01:02:39.093 --> 01:02:43.300
How did word even leak that
Halloran was in here? Huh?

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:46.508
Are you pointing the finger at me?

01:02:46.735 --> 01:02:49.016
Should I be?

01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:50.861
I don't know, Charles.

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:53.103
You know, people talk.

01:02:53.299 --> 01:02:54.623
What are we supposed to do?

Put this piece of shit in
a witness protection program

when we can't even validate a
single fucking thing he says?

And you're pointing the finger at me?

01:03:02.441 --> 01:03:04.355
I'm trying to bring down the Italian Mafia

with the help of Jimmy Bulger,

finger at fucking me?

faggot love for each other?

01:03:16.933 --> 01:03:18.565
Did you just call me a faggot, huh?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.082
That's it. That's it.

01:03:20.117 --> 01:03:20.758
Come here!

01:03:20.793 --> 01:03:22.442
- That's it.
- Fucking faggot!

01:03:22.477 --> 01:03:25.026
- You're making my point exactly, Connolly.
- Come on!

01:03:25.061 --> 01:03:28.104
I'm putting an end to this
Bulger and Flemmi informer shit.

01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:29.430
- You can't do that! No!
- You cannot tell me

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:31.776
that they're not connected to this killing!

01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:33.025
You cannot fucking tell me that!

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.339
It's too important! You can't do it!

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.866
You got to fucking listen
to this. It's Angiulo.

and use of arson, how he
handled his pimps and his pros.

Jimmy had some loose ends to tie up.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.328
I think he thought having Connolly along

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.132

OLSEN: Just for the record,

01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:13.871
you killed John Callahan
that night in Miami...

01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:17.933
shot him in the head and stuffed
him in the trunk of his own car.

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.660
Yes.

01:07:19.766 --> 01:07:22.376
Was John Connolly aware of that fact?

01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:24.575
Yes, he was.

Those lapels, that tapering.

01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:53.833
I see you got a nice,
new gold watch there, too.

Nothing. Not anything.

- Marianne?
- Hmm?

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:03.286
You're dressing differently.
You're walking differently.

01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:04.738
You're getting manicures.

01:08:04.826 --> 01:08:07.588
Uhh... I'm walking differently?

01:08:07.662 --> 01:08:08.810
Yeah, I think you are.

the way you carry yourself.

01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:12.939
You're changing, John.

I'm not changing. I'm not changing!

01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:18.736
I'm... I might be getting
older, but I'm not changing.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.245
It's Jimmy Bulger that's changing you.

01:08:20.312 --> 01:08:21.492
Ah, here we go.

01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:23.796
Ever since you locked arms
with that guy, you've changed.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.770
I can see it like the nose on my face.

01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:27.002
He's bad news, John.

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:28.252
He's not bad news.

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:29.694
He is an informant.

01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:31.395
It's my job.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.563
You know this. I told you this.

01:08:33.598 --> 01:08:35.939
I've known him since forever.

01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:38.522
And you certainly hold your
boyhood heroes in high regard.

How was he good to you, John?

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:47.667
Did he take you
trick-or-treating?

[whispering] Fuck.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.380
Like it or not, Marianne,
you married a street kid.

01:09:00.453 --> 01:09:01.636
And the streets taught me

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:04.823
that you give and you get
loyalty from your friends.

01:09:06.978 --> 01:09:09.115
And loyalty means a lot to me.

they did appear to die.

punishment as men see it,

their hope was rich with immortality.

couldn't pallbearer with us.

protecting the family name.

this very table with you

on my first campaign.

[chuckles]

01:10:30.664 --> 01:10:32.132
I was stuffing envelopes

01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:35.236
and licking stamps until my tongue was dry.

Mm-hmm.

John.

01:10:50.244 --> 01:10:52.983
I'm very sorry for your loss, Jimmy.

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:54.966
Your mother was a good woman.

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:56.489
Thanks.

Well, I'll let you guys have some time.

Never heard this house so quiet.

MARTORANO: First his son
died, then his mother passed.

01:11:41.466 --> 01:11:43.920
And Jimmy was devastated.

He was never the same.

01:11:46.312 --> 01:11:48.012
The only time he ever seemed happy

01:11:48.047 --> 01:11:50.155
was when he was talking about the I.R.A.

01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:22.519

01:12:30.544 --> 01:12:31.868
I have to tell you, that would be

01:12:31.929 --> 01:12:34.433
a rather large arsenal, indeed.

01:12:34.776 --> 01:12:36.883

01:14:07.957 --> 01:14:09.669
Jimmy, you know she's a prostitute.

01:14:09.704 --> 01:14:12.687
Do not assume what I do or do not know.

You answer my fucking question.

Is she or is she not a prostitute?

01:14:16.804 --> 01:14:18.712
Correct.

01:14:18.838 --> 01:14:22.325
And she's a fucking hopeless
drug addict, as well.

01:14:22.611 --> 01:14:24.000

Hi.

01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:32.191
She may know a few things
she shouldn't have. I'm sorry.

01:14:33.598 --> 01:14:36.227
You fucking better be sorry, pal.

01:14:38.903 --> 01:14:41.214

So, where are we going?

01:14:56.969 --> 01:15:00.512
Well... not far.

01:15:01.215 --> 01:15:03.161
We found a place where
you could stay a while.

01:15:03.196 --> 01:15:05.651
It's very comfortable, you know.

01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:07.234
Quiet.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.262
Nobody's gonna bother you.

01:15:09.362 --> 01:15:10.106
Sounds great.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.329
But before we leave,

01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:16.117
I, uh, I have a few questions.

01:15:16.323 --> 01:15:18.952
Sure. What do you want to know?

01:15:18.987 --> 01:15:20.429
What did you just talk about?

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.122

Yeah, you.

01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:28.743
Deborah, sweetheart, you just spent

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.720
the fucking night in the can.

01:15:30.905 --> 01:15:31.852
Yeah.

01:15:31.887 --> 01:15:34.960
Okay, so, where the fuck
did you sleep last night?

01:15:35.119 --> 01:15:37.601
- There.
- And what the fuck is that?

01:15:39.538 --> 01:15:40.366
Police station.

01:15:40.401 --> 01:15:41.440
And who would you be talking to

01:15:41.475 --> 01:15:44.320
in a goddamn police station, Deborah?

01:15:45.614 --> 01:15:47.488
The police?

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:49.708
Exactly.

01:15:50.248 --> 01:15:53.023
So, what did the police say to you,

01:15:53.219 --> 01:15:56.189
and what did you say back to them?

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.719
Nothing much.

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:00.469

01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:01.906

01:16:01.941 --> 01:16:04.685
I don't know the usual.
What's the fucking usual?

01:16:04.737 --> 01:16:07.394
You know... drugs are bad.
Prostitution's illegal.

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.009
Shit like that.

01:16:09.796 --> 01:16:13.801
And did Stevie and I figure
into this conversation at all?

01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:17.527
They asked if I was involved with you.

01:16:17.602 --> 01:16:18.774
I said no.

01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:21.854
They asked if I was involved
with Stevie, too. I said no.

01:16:22.557 --> 01:16:24.512
That part was actually a lie,

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:25.621

- Obviously.

know about Stevie and I?

01:16:34.018 --> 01:16:35.112
And drugs.

01:16:35.147 --> 01:16:37.286
They think you're selling a lot of drugs.

01:16:37.473 --> 01:16:39.390
- Do they?
- Yeah.

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:41.390
And what did you tell them?

01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:43.317
That you didn't.

01:16:43.435 --> 01:16:45.669
That you hang out at Triple O's.

That you was real clean.
Your clothes was real clean.

01:16:48.207 --> 01:16:50.789
You hardly drink any
liquor. You don't do drugs.

01:16:51.492 --> 01:16:52.165
And that you always say,

"Don't believe what you
read in the fucking papers."

01:16:54.913 --> 01:16:56.678

01:21:22.995 --> 01:21:25.832
You're quiet tonight, huh? [chuckles]

01:21:26.171 --> 01:21:29.158
You got a problem with people
keeping their mouths shut?

01:21:29.869 --> 01:21:32.406
I'm breaking your balls. Hmm?

01:21:34.067 --> 01:21:36.708
Do yourself a favor... don't.

01:21:37.581 --> 01:21:41.703
[clears throat] So, uh, guys.

01:21:41.839 --> 01:21:46.457
Uh, I... I hate to bring this
up at a... at a social dinner,

01:21:46.492 --> 01:21:49.753
but there's this detective in Florida

01:21:49.788 --> 01:21:51.737
that keeps calling us about Callahan.

01:21:51.808 --> 01:21:54.107
Asking questions, and, uh...

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:56.229
Well, h-h-he just
won't leave it alone,

01:21:56.262 --> 01:21:58.012
and I have to handle it.

01:21:58.144 --> 01:21:59.846
Then handle it.

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:03.599
Well, handle it.

01:22:03.634 --> 01:22:06.638
Well... Yeah.

01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:11.435
And Morris...

01:22:12.484 --> 01:22:15.821
you and I got to have
a little sit-down here.

01:22:18.627 --> 01:22:22.970
What the fuck did you
marinate this steak in?

01:22:23.033 --> 01:22:24.631
Because it's out of this world.

01:22:24.666 --> 01:22:26.167
You're killing me with it.

01:22:26.202 --> 01:22:28.238
Now, now, now.

01:22:28.584 --> 01:22:31.104
It's a family secret. Hmm?

01:22:31.402 --> 01:22:33.863
- Come on.
- [laughs]

01:22:33.964 --> 01:22:35.268
Aw.

01:22:35.399 --> 01:22:37.390
That is one of the best goddamn steaks

01:22:37.425 --> 01:22:39.528
- I ever had in my life.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:39.605 --> 01:22:40.840
Ever.

01:22:44.644 --> 01:22:47.213
- I got a knife over here.
- [laughs]

01:22:47.297 --> 01:22:49.035
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:50.753
What's... what's the...
what's the family...

01:22:50.813 --> 01:22:52.574
what's the family's secret recipe?

01:22:52.609 --> 01:22:54.884
It's g... it's ground garlic

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:57.460
and a little bit of soy.

01:22:57.508 --> 01:23:00.479
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.

01:23:08.179 --> 01:23:10.983
I thought it was a family secret.

01:23:13.914 --> 01:23:16.257
[chuckles] It's a recipe.

01:23:16.311 --> 01:23:17.862
No.

01:23:19.017 --> 01:23:20.465
No.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.075
You said to me this is a family secret,

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:27.081
and you gave it up to me, boom.

01:23:27.185 --> 01:23:30.622
Just fucking like that.

01:23:31.236 --> 01:23:32.203
Don't look to John

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:34.635
'cause he's not gonna fucking help you.

01:23:39.899 --> 01:23:43.403
You spill the secret family recipe today,

01:23:43.438 --> 01:23:45.913
maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.

01:23:45.948 --> 01:23:48.772
Is that something, maybe,
that's a possibility?

01:23:48.807 --> 01:23:49.781
I was just saying...

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:51.652
You were "just saying"?

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:55.615
"Just saying" gets
people sent to Allenwood.

01:23:55.681 --> 01:23:59.187
"Just saying" got me a nine-year stretch

01:23:59.222 --> 01:24:01.175
in Leavenworth and Alcatraz.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:02.687
You understand?

01:24:02.722 --> 01:24:06.442
So, "just saying"...

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:11.464
could get you buried real fucking quick.

01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:22.743
[laughing]

01:24:29.327 --> 01:24:31.516
Look at his fucking face!

01:24:31.551 --> 01:24:34.321
Hey! I'm fucking with you.

01:24:34.354 --> 01:24:35.686
Hey, I'm fucking with you.

01:24:35.721 --> 01:24:37.922
It's a recipe. Couldn't give a shit.

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.861
Tastes great. I'm fucking with you.

01:24:40.953 --> 01:24:41.567
[laughs]

01:24:41.602 --> 01:24:43.115
- [laughs]
- All right.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:46.119
You got... well, you... you got me, too.

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:46.999
[chuckles]

01:24:47.033 --> 01:24:49.700
Listen, I... I want to...
I want to make a toast.

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:52.719
To success.

01:24:54.198 --> 01:24:56.434
Just getting started.

01:25:03.427 --> 01:25:06.793
Mm. Where's the wife?

01:25:07.027 --> 01:25:08.781
She's, uh... she's resting.

01:25:08.816 --> 01:25:11.152
She's... she's a little under the weather.

01:25:12.883 --> 01:25:15.686
Didn't... didn't I just see her?

01:25:15.917 --> 01:25:17.163
Yeah, she was helping.

01:25:17.228 --> 01:25:20.715
She, uh... well, sh... sh...
she's not feeling very good.

01:25:20.869 --> 01:25:22.156
Oh, gee.

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:23.589
Like a...

01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:25.967
You know what? I'll go have a look at her.

01:25:26.074 --> 01:25:27.282
Jimmy. Jimmy.

01:25:27.317 --> 01:25:28.800
She's sick. She's fi... she's fi...

01:25:28.835 --> 01:25:30.400
listen... fine.

01:25:42.479 --> 01:25:44.415

01:25:51.463 --> 01:25:52.174
Oh.

01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:54.613
Hi. I thought you were John.

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:57.742
No, it ain't John.

01:25:57.803 --> 01:26:00.952
Come on. Come down and join us.

01:26:00.998 --> 01:26:03.444
No, I'm not feeling
well. Thank you, though.

01:26:04.179 --> 01:26:05.714
Marianne, you know what you're doing?

01:26:05.749 --> 01:26:08.449
You're embarrassing your
husband in front of his friends,

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.833
that's what you're doing.

01:26:09.914 --> 01:26:12.584
And you know that's what you're doing.

01:26:13.048 --> 01:26:16.200
I don't know what John told
you, but I'm feeling ill.

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.559
That's all.

01:26:19.726 --> 01:26:21.686
Please, no offense.

01:26:24.461 --> 01:26:26.906
Well, let's see what you got.

01:26:27.358 --> 01:26:29.184
Um...

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:32.135
yeah.

01:26:35.039 --> 01:26:37.068
Well...

01:26:37.827 --> 01:26:40.558
you don't feel warm.

01:26:42.259 --> 01:26:44.325
Got any chills?

01:26:45.249 --> 01:26:46.797
'Cause normally, you get the chills

01:26:46.832 --> 01:26:49.430
before the flu comes on, you know?

01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:55.254
Any soreness there?

01:26:57.428 --> 01:27:01.358
What are you feeling
there? You feel something?

01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:06.910
'Cause I don't feel any
swollen glands there.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.755
But, you know, me, I
had to learn the hard way

01:27:15.781 --> 01:27:18.710
not to take chances
with this kind of thing.

01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:21.040
You know what I'm saying?

01:27:22.726 --> 01:27:24.772
Poor little thing.

01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:27.860
You get some rest.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:30.345
Wouldn't want nothing to happen to you.

01:27:40.432 --> 01:27:42.867
John's a lucky man.

01:27:47.491 --> 01:27:50.710
[breathing shakily]

01:28:14.577 --> 01:28:15.858
Jimmy?

01:28:17.305 --> 01:28:19.599
I'll get it there safe and sound.

01:28:19.946 --> 01:28:21.777
You can sleep on it.

01:28:21.887 --> 01:28:23.847
I know you will, McIntyre.

01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:25.851
Have safe travels, huh?

01:28:26.407 --> 01:28:28.116
All right.

01:28:28.151 --> 01:28:28.826
Stevie.

01:28:28.861 --> 01:28:30.818
Take care of it, John.

01:28:31.364 --> 01:28:33.248
Weeksy, give me a call.

01:28:33.368 --> 01:28:35.686
Thanks for everything,
Jimmy. We won't forget it.

01:28:35.721 --> 01:28:37.199
For me, it's an honor.

01:28:37.287 --> 01:28:38.888
The honor's ours.

01:28:39.198 --> 01:28:40.636
Thanks, pal.

CONNOLLY: Hope I'm not interrupting.

01:28:59.284 --> 01:29:01.138
Special Agent John Connolly.

01:29:01.173 --> 01:29:02.806
I know who you are. I've
heard a lot about you.

01:29:02.841 --> 01:29:04.862
Oh, good things, I hope.

01:29:04.957 --> 01:29:07.495
Listen, little welcome
wagon present for you.

01:29:07.589 --> 01:29:09.525
- Big game.
- I'm good.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.898
Are you sure about that?
Clemens is on the mound tonight.

01:29:11.933 --> 01:29:13.478
I'm sure about that.

01:29:13.513 --> 01:29:15.016
All right.

01:29:15.133 --> 01:29:16.697
Work, work, work.

01:29:16.778 --> 01:29:18.714
Well, listen, after... after you finish,

01:29:18.749 --> 01:29:20.736
come down to
The Bell-In-Hand.

01:29:20.806 --> 01:29:22.670
I would like to buy you a pint,

01:29:22.705 --> 01:29:25.212
and you can meet some of the other agents.

01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:30.077
Do you have a case for me, Agent Connolly?

01:29:30.112 --> 01:29:32.851
No, I just came to i... introduce myself.

01:29:32.886 --> 01:29:35.332
You know, couple of local
boys moving up the ranks.

01:29:35.387 --> 01:29:38.465
Maybe we can help each other along. Yeah.

01:29:38.527 --> 01:29:41.489
Bring me cases, that's all the help I need.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.641
All right.

01:29:45.289 --> 01:29:48.141
All right, well, [chuckles]
I'll leave you to it, then.

01:29:48.278 --> 01:29:49.707
Hey, you know, since you're here.

01:29:49.742 --> 01:29:51.014
Yeah?

01:29:51.429 --> 01:29:53.481
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

01:29:53.516 --> 01:29:55.445
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.863
That won't work. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

01:29:57.898 --> 01:30:00.079
- Excuse me?
- Now, what's Bulger done?

01:30:00.148 --> 01:30:05.061
He's a smalltime hood, but he...
he... he's an invaluable asset.

01:30:05.243 --> 01:30:07.658
What's he done?

01:30:07.726 --> 01:30:10.000
Everything, evidently.

01:30:10.035 --> 01:30:13.048
Drugs, extortion, murder.

01:30:13.163 --> 01:30:13.906
I'd heard rumors,

01:30:13.961 --> 01:30:16.234
but these other informant
reports make it clear.

01:30:16.269 --> 01:30:17.055
And he... here's the thing...

01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:20.053
every time we start a
formal investigation, poof!

01:30:20.193 --> 01:30:22.408
Goes away. He slips free.

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:24.709
How do you account for that?

01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.125
I don't know.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.425
Luck of the Irish? [chuckles]

01:30:29.545 --> 01:30:31.420
"Luck of the Irish"? That's
what you're going with?

01:30:31.455 --> 01:30:33.524
Well, it's...

01:30:35.165 --> 01:30:37.587
...it's slandering lies

01:30:37.622 --> 01:30:40.025
from his brother Billy's
political opponents.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.071
These fucking assholes from Cambridge,

01:30:42.106 --> 01:30:43.949
they will do anything to bring Billy down

01:30:43.984 --> 01:30:45.586
because they can't stand

01:30:45.621 --> 01:30:48.054
power in the hands of a Mick from Southie.

01:30:48.089 --> 01:30:49.112
You don't think Billy's protecting

01:30:49.147 --> 01:30:50.566
his older brother, just maybe?

01:30:50.601 --> 01:30:52.243
No! No way.

01:30:52.326 --> 01:30:53.833
Really?

01:30:54.164 --> 01:30:54.964
Well, it seems to me

01:30:54.999 --> 01:30:56.512
you'd have to believe
in fucking leprechauns

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:59.658
to think we have the
biggest crime lord in Boston

01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:02.241
and be brothers with the
most powerful politician

01:31:02.276 --> 01:31:05.942
in the state and them <i>not</i>
be helping each other out.

01:31:05.977 --> 01:31:09.085
I grew up with Billy, Southie.

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:12.124
So, I know him, I know that <i>he</i> knows

01:31:12.159 --> 01:31:13.079
that it would be crazy

01:31:13.114 --> 01:31:15.950
for him to get mixed up in
anything that Jimmy does.

01:31:16.027 --> 01:31:18.978
It's, you know... too brazen.

01:31:19.091 --> 01:31:20.860
I'll ask you again...

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.662
how come no one has done Whitey Bulger?

01:31:23.758 --> 01:31:26.431
He seems to be involved
in every crime in the city

01:31:26.466 --> 01:31:28.606
and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.

01:31:28.654 --> 01:31:30.987
It's only when <i>another</i>
agency has an informant

01:31:31.022 --> 01:31:33.840
that I hear <i>maybe</i>
Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.

♪♪

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.449
Well, I hear that he's very careful,

he doesn't use phones...
that kind of stuff, and, uh...

01:31:41.967 --> 01:31:45.043
Who did you say these
other informants were?

01:31:45.459 --> 01:31:47.091
I didn't.

01:31:49.564 --> 01:31:51.744
Listen, from what I hear,

01:31:51.857 --> 01:31:53.741
his criminal days are all but over.

01:31:53.776 --> 01:31:56.152

him, they gone legit...

Is Whitey never using phones and careful,

or is Whitey retired?!

01:32:02.256 --> 01:32:03.624
I don't...

01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:06.807
I mean, I just... I'm not in my office...

01:32:06.842 --> 01:32:08.111
these are things that I hear,

01:32:08.146 --> 01:32:09.583
I don't know if all of them are true.

01:32:09.618 --> 01:32:12.125
Do your job and find out!

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.809
I am. I am. I... I wa...

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:22.276
You know that I wouldn't come
here if it wasn't serious,

01:32:22.427 --> 01:32:23.875
if there was anywhere else I could turn,

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:25.880
and I know that the last thing you need

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:29.079
is to have Jimmy's business
crossing paths with yours.

01:32:29.114 --> 01:32:31.042
Well, your grasp of the
situation is so keen,

01:32:31.077 --> 01:32:32.743
it makes me wonder what you're doing here.

01:32:32.778 --> 01:32:37.392
This new guy, Wyshak, has
a serious hard-on for Jimmy.

01:32:37.427 --> 01:32:39.239
And that can't be good for any of us.

01:32:39.302 --> 01:32:40.706
And you're telling me this why?

01:32:40.772 --> 01:32:42.827
Maybe you can influence him.

01:32:42.862 --> 01:32:44.030
Just make him listen to reason!

01:32:44.065 --> 01:32:45.851
I'm not kissing your ass, Billy,

01:32:45.892 --> 01:32:48.364
but you are the most
powerful man in the city.

01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:50.136
Not that I would, but Wyshak's federal,

01:32:50.184 --> 01:32:51.784
and I'm state, and you know that.

01:32:51.819 --> 01:32:56.289
But where we come from, I know and you know

01:32:56.324 --> 01:32:59.922
that what is written on a piece of paper

01:33:00.054 --> 01:33:06.137
is less important than
blood and honor and loyalty.

01:33:09.839 --> 01:33:12.195
I'm not asking you to help me.

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:15.453
I'm asking you to help your brother.

01:33:17.888 --> 01:33:20.463
That's the same thing now, isn't it?

01:33:26.962 --> 01:33:29.166
[sighs]

01:33:31.922 --> 01:33:39.353
Billy, Wyshak is asking
questions about you, too.

01:33:42.085 --> 01:33:43.647
Oh.

01:33:50.289 --> 01:33:53.447
John, you know I have the
utmost respect for you.

01:33:53.482 --> 01:33:57.446
Really, I do, which is why I
can tell you with all my heart

01:33:57.617 --> 01:33:59.696
that if you ever come into my office again

01:33:59.751 --> 01:34:01.664
with a fucked-up idea like that

01:34:01.699 --> 01:34:05.406
you'll rue the day you ever
thought of joining the FBI.

01:34:10.789 --> 01:34:12.659
Jeannie will show you out.

01:34:21.594 --> 01:34:22.842
FITZPATRICK: This report has information

01:34:22.877 --> 01:34:26.989
attributed to our prized
informant Whitey Bulger.

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.416
And this is the same piece of information

01:34:32.451 --> 01:34:34.587
from one of our other informants

01:34:34.679 --> 01:34:36.281
dated four weeks earlier.

01:34:36.315 --> 01:34:40.201
_

01:34:40.236 --> 01:34:41.783
This is information credited to

01:34:41.818 --> 01:34:45.912
our supposedly prized
informant James "Whitey" Bulger.

01:34:49.068 --> 01:34:51.584
- And the same piece of information
- _

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:55.913
dated six weeks earlier,
different informant.

01:34:56.265 --> 01:34:57.674
_

01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:59.695
In fact, if you take a
look at Bulger's pile,

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.400
you'll find the same situation played out

01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:03.387
time and again from other sources.

01:35:03.462 --> 01:35:09.978
In fact, you'll find very little
from Bulger that means shit.

01:35:10.013 --> 01:35:12.049
[typewriter clicking]

01:35:15.867 --> 01:35:18.829
<i>Customs officials in Boston
say they have seized a trawler</i>

01:35:18.883 --> 01:35:21.819
<i>used to smuggle weapons
to Irish terrorists.</i>

01:35:21.854 --> 01:35:24.625
<i>Agents say the trawler ferried
a load of arms and ammunition</i>

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.859
- <i>to the Irish coast last week.</i>
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:35:26.894 --> 01:35:29.440
<i>The weapons were intercepted
by the Irish Navy</i>

01:35:29.475 --> 01:35:32.031
<i>after they had been
transferred to a smaller ship.</i>

01:35:32.082 --> 01:35:35.242
- <i>Officials say they have seized the ship's log and other doc...</i>
- Motherfucker.

01:35:35.267 --> 01:35:37.035
Northern Ireland?

01:35:37.115 --> 01:35:38.350
FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

01:35:40.697 --> 01:35:42.472
Well, how did they know about the ship?

01:35:42.507 --> 01:35:45.265
The pilot. Turns out he's
also a snitch for D.E.A.

01:35:45.332 --> 01:35:46.925
Customs, too.

01:35:48.299 --> 01:35:50.021
What's his name?

01:35:50.231 --> 01:35:51.882
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

01:35:51.917 --> 01:35:54.979
I... don't know, John.

01:35:58.007 --> 01:36:01.544
All right, well, where is
this guy now, the pilot?

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.243
- I want to talk to him.
- Oh, no can do.

01:36:04.306 --> 01:36:06.712
What do you mean, "No can do"? Yes, can do.

01:36:06.763 --> 01:36:08.527
Sorry, he belongs to D.E.A.

01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:10.549
Well... okay.

01:36:10.603 --> 01:36:13.905
You ask permission for us to talk to him.

01:36:13.953 --> 01:36:16.027
- I did.
- And?

01:36:16.092 --> 01:36:18.662
It's not gonna happen, John.

01:36:46.726 --> 01:36:48.353
MCINTYRE: I don't like that guy, though.

01:36:48.388 --> 01:36:50.545
He's got a big fucking mouth.

01:36:52.467 --> 01:36:53.670
FLEMMI: Yeah, take a right here.

01:36:53.745 --> 01:36:55.181
Yeah? All right.

01:36:55.405 --> 01:36:56.894
All right, I got it.

01:36:59.336 --> 01:37:01.939
[laughs] Weeksy, what's up?

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:07.164
Where is everybody? I thought
it was a fucking party.

01:37:08.288 --> 01:37:10.342
Bulger's playing us, Nick.

01:37:10.428 --> 01:37:11.915
Making a fool of the Bureau,

01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:13.493
hiding behind his informant status

01:37:13.548 --> 01:37:15.827
to run roughshod over my city.

01:37:15.862 --> 01:37:17.716
Using us to cover for him.

01:37:17.751 --> 01:37:18.955
I won't stand for it.

01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:20.356
NICK: And I am distressed about that,

01:37:20.411 --> 01:37:21.411
but from where I sit,

01:37:21.437 --> 01:37:23.979
we have bigger priorities to consider.

01:37:24.033 --> 01:37:25.344
So, you're telling me to do nothing.

01:37:25.392 --> 01:37:27.593
No, not at all.

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.503
I'm telling you we can't taint

01:37:29.538 --> 01:37:31.885
one of the most successful
RICO prosecutions

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.908
in the history of the Bureau

01:37:32.943 --> 01:37:37.600
just to get Whitey
Bulger, psychopath or not.

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.346
But we have no objection

01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:41.903
to your going after
the agents handling him.

01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:46.776
[sighs] Can't you see what's happening?

01:37:46.823 --> 01:37:49.111
The vise is closing on us.

01:37:50.045 --> 01:37:51.791
Listen to me.

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.586
Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson

01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:57.355
that hit that national bank on Exeter?

01:37:57.402 --> 01:38:01.686
No, and neither did I,
until Whitey Bulger told us.

01:38:01.738 --> 01:38:03.019
Whitey didn't tell us that.

01:38:03.054 --> 01:38:05.042
Yes, he did.

01:38:05.197 --> 01:38:09.611
Nick McVeigh is running speed
to high schools in Newton.

01:38:09.659 --> 01:38:12.651
High school kids, for fuck's sake.

01:38:12.905 --> 01:38:14.370
Thank God for Whitey Bulger.

01:38:14.405 --> 01:38:16.635
- [chuckles] Thank God for Whitey Bulger.
- You hear me?

01:38:16.683 --> 01:38:20.395
Whitey introduced dope
to every kid in Southie.

01:38:20.443 --> 01:38:23.888
12- and 13-year-old
girls, John.

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.770
What about Halloran?

01:38:25.805 --> 01:38:27.213
And Callahan, huh?

01:38:27.258 --> 01:38:29.320
Douchebags who got what was coming to them.

01:38:29.355 --> 01:38:31.267
It's not our fault.

01:38:31.302 --> 01:38:32.724
It's not our fault?

01:38:32.789 --> 01:38:34.924
- Whose fault is it?
- Not ours.

01:38:34.979 --> 01:38:37.469
That's gonna sound great in court.

01:38:38.753 --> 01:38:40.255
McGuire is gonna go to Washington.

01:38:40.325 --> 01:38:42.040
You know that, right?

01:38:42.954 --> 01:38:45.059
And he's gonna bring
all the informant files.

01:38:45.154 --> 01:38:49.712
And Wyshak is dead set on
hanging our asses on his wall.

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:51.754
We are fucked, John.

01:38:51.812 --> 01:38:53.782
- We are fucked.
- Listen to me.

01:38:53.849 --> 01:38:55.815
The Bureau wants results.

01:38:55.893 --> 01:38:57.216
We gave them results.

01:38:57.251 --> 01:39:00.234
We drove a stake through
the black heart of the Mafia.

01:39:00.269 --> 01:39:02.908
Everything else is gonna be a sideshow.

01:39:02.962 --> 01:39:04.153
Now we're stuck with Whitey,

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.769
and without the Italians,
nobody can rein him in,

01:39:06.804 --> 01:39:08.607
and we can't even pull on his chain

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:10.244
because we're in too deep!

01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:11.695
And he knows it!

01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:14.848
You understand what I'm
saying about a vise?!

01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:21.939
I thought I was doing good.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.640
I actually thought I
could make a difference.

01:39:24.675 --> 01:39:25.939
We made a difference.

01:39:25.974 --> 01:39:28.036
We put the Mafia out of business.

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.217
If that ain't good, I don't know what is.

01:39:31.933 --> 01:39:32.970
Yeah.

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.830
And you know what we're doing now, John?

01:39:36.968 --> 01:39:39.305
Digging our own fucking graves.

01:39:50.101 --> 01:39:52.603
[keys jingling]

01:39:56.815 --> 01:39:58.811
[lock rattling]

01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:00.705
[sighs]

01:40:02.379 --> 01:40:04.054
God damn it.

01:40:10.429 --> 01:40:12.216
Marianne!

01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:18.323
Marianne, don't do this!

01:40:21.258 --> 01:40:24.547
Marianne, are you fucking kidding me?!

01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:36.441
WYSHAK: This informant
has been a minor player

01:40:36.476 --> 01:40:39.572
in the Boston crime syndicate
since he was a teenager.

01:40:39.652 --> 01:40:41.564
- So you checked his house?
- Yes.

01:40:41.612 --> 01:40:43.214
- And work?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:43.288 --> 01:40:45.248
And he's never missed an
informant meeting before?

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.091
None I'm aware of. Yeah?

01:40:47.126 --> 01:40:48.349
MAN: No, nothing.

01:40:48.384 --> 01:40:49.574
[knock on door]

01:40:49.631 --> 01:40:51.529
- You want to see me?
- WYSHAK: Yeah, I want to see you!

01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:52.765
McIntyre has vanished

01:40:52.811 --> 01:40:54.661
off the face of the fucking Earth.

01:40:54.712 --> 01:40:55.845
Which seems to be a common phenomenon

01:40:55.913 --> 01:40:57.615
for any informant that
says something incriminating

01:40:57.650 --> 01:40:59.287
against Whitey Bulger.

01:41:01.623 --> 01:41:03.909
You got nothing to say, Connolly?

01:41:04.306 --> 01:41:05.876
You see these gentlemen here?

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.149
They're gonna help me get this cocksucker.

01:41:08.224 --> 01:41:11.320
If we have to arrest every
lowlife in Boston to do that,

01:41:11.355 --> 01:41:13.256
we'll arrest them... every loan shark,

01:41:13.291 --> 01:41:15.202
every bookie, every drug dealer.

01:41:15.263 --> 01:41:17.909
One of those guys is gonna
make a case against him.

01:41:18.909 --> 01:41:21.204
JIMMY: Of all fucking people...

01:41:22.188 --> 01:41:23.360
[chuckles]

01:41:23.635 --> 01:41:24.934
...you.

01:41:34.452 --> 01:41:35.879
MCINTYRE: [voice
breaking] I'm sorry, Jimmy.

01:41:35.914 --> 01:41:39.135
You've always been fucking
weak, John, since we was kids.

01:41:39.170 --> 01:41:40.454
- [whimpering]
- What'd you tell them?

01:41:40.489 --> 01:41:44.423
[crying] I don't want to
fucking die. Oh, God, Jimmy!

01:41:44.514 --> 01:41:47.288
I need to know exactly
who you fucking talked to,

01:41:47.323 --> 01:41:49.626
and exactly what you said.

01:41:49.721 --> 01:41:52.891
A D.E.A. agent by the name of Brown.

01:41:52.926 --> 01:41:54.287
I told him everything...

01:41:54.322 --> 01:41:57.348
the I.R.A., Cahill, the whole bit!

01:41:57.447 --> 01:42:01.062
I know I shouldn't have,
Jimmy, but I had no choice!

01:42:03.907 --> 01:42:05.605
Fuck you.

01:42:06.598 --> 01:42:08.876
You always have a choice.

01:42:09.007 --> 01:42:11.672
You just happened to make
the wrong fucking one.

01:42:11.701 --> 01:42:14.113
[breathing shakily]

01:42:14.897 --> 01:42:16.532
Look at me.

01:42:18.793 --> 01:42:21.243
I said fucking look at me.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.884
I known you a long time.

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:28.833
And for you to fuck me like this...

01:42:31.207 --> 01:42:33.443
...fucking hurts.

01:42:36.615 --> 01:42:40.105
So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here

01:42:40.145 --> 01:42:42.707
where all the other weak
people have been buried.

01:42:42.742 --> 01:42:44.033
Jimmy, I'm sorry!

01:42:44.068 --> 01:42:46.602
But you'll be dead before
Stevie pulls your teeth,

which is more than you fucking deserve,

01:42:48.613 --> 01:42:49.961
- I'll tell you that.

Thank you for meeting with us.

[chuckles softly]

01:44:02.922 --> 01:44:05.029
Like I should be in a confessional.

01:44:05.516 --> 01:44:08.434
It's the right thing to do, John.

01:44:11.179 --> 01:44:13.709
Anything I tell you has
to be off the record.

01:44:13.744 --> 01:44:15.565
- You understand?
- Of course.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.452
We'll develop our own sources,
corroborate everything.

- All of it.

LEHR: We know.

01:44:33.918 --> 01:44:35.093
And you're running it?

01:44:35.128 --> 01:44:36.998

What is it, Jim?

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:46.233

01:45:49.486 --> 01:45:51.563
What the fuck? This is bullshit.

01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:55.920
Right? This isn't true.

01:45:56.068 --> 01:45:59.307
[scoffs] Right?

a lot of nasty things.

01:46:11.114 --> 01:46:15.080
And most of it, if not all
of it, is fucking untrue.

01:46:15.115 --> 01:46:17.287
It's pure fiction.

01:46:17.822 --> 01:46:19.692
You know me.

01:46:20.713 --> 01:46:22.360
And you know these people.

You know these fucking people.

01:46:25.211 --> 01:46:27.146
They're liars.

They know no fucking code of honor.

01:46:35.275 --> 01:46:38.548
How many envelopes of fucking cash

01:46:38.583 --> 01:46:41.733
did you deliver to these Feds?

01:46:41.768 --> 01:46:45.628
How many cases of wine
for that prick Morris?

01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:47.471
Or fucking vacations,

01:46:47.511 --> 01:46:52.089
or, uh, fucking money,

01:46:58.748 --> 01:47:01.848
Does that sound like
what an informant does?

01:47:03.697 --> 01:47:05.756
Guy ran a sports and numbers racket

01:47:05.811 --> 01:47:09.006
out of Heller's Cafe,
parlayed it into loan sharking,

01:47:09.041 --> 01:47:11.466
and that into money laundering.

01:47:11.568 --> 01:47:13.781

01:47:19.101 --> 01:47:20.785
No, but I can call them if you want.

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:22.630
Absolutely not.

01:47:22.789 --> 01:47:25.358
Can you get me into witness protection?

01:47:25.393 --> 01:47:27.127
Depends what you have.

01:47:27.162 --> 01:47:28.887
I have Whitey Bulger.

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:31.824
So, Whitey Bulger took a
piece of everything you made?

01:47:31.895 --> 01:47:33.734
What, are you fucking kidding me?

01:47:33.821 --> 01:47:36.032
Everything. Wasn't small either.

01:47:36.067 --> 01:47:38.532
Yeah, Whitey introduced drugs to Southie.

01:47:38.587 --> 01:47:40.260

was a half a block away,

01:47:48.798 --> 01:47:50.434
I don't know who it was.

01:47:50.469 --> 01:47:52.335
Pulled him out of a car and
shot him on the fucking...

01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:54.074
right on the ground.

01:47:58.035 --> 01:48:00.108
It's everything...

01:48:00.184 --> 01:48:05.531
extortion, racketeering, murder.

01:48:06.245 --> 01:48:08.377
They got you on all of it.

01:48:09.053 --> 01:48:11.364
And I guess they got me, too.

01:48:13.824 --> 01:48:15.827
You used me, Jimmy.

01:48:16.434 --> 01:48:19.924
It was an alliance, John, nothing more.

Just let me know what you know.
