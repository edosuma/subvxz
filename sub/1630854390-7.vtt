WEBVTT

01:49.610 --> 01:51.028
Are we talking yet?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.362
Sure. Why not?

01:55.657 --> 01:56.825
You want some coffee?

02:19.681 --> 02:21.767
I'm gonna start working Richard today.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.602
I still disagree.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.859
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.862
You know what that drum was about?
It was, like, all through the night.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.281
-It kept me up.
-It turns out it was a vigil.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.617
-For what?
-Christ's crucifixion.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.162
Judas betrayed him.
The cock crowed. He was crucified.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.581
It's Good Friday, Easter weekend.
Now we wait.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.625
Wait for what?

02:46.708 --> 02:47.918
His resurrection.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
Who wants some fresh empanadas?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.135
-Do we have milk?
-Go see.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.221
Okay.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.938
You know, you can't trust the government
in any of your dealings with them.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.731
I know.

03:09.815 --> 03:10.816
Do you?

03:13.277 --> 03:14.278
When will you be back?

03:15.153 --> 03:18.866
I've been summoned by our landlord.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.994
You're really gonna give him Sandpiper?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.581
Don't know what I'm gonna do.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.332
Be careful.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.418
Yeah.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.129
I'll see what I can do.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.356
You hungry?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.692
I thought we'd eat.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.779
Or would you prefer a bottle?

06:03.363 --> 06:07.743
Why is it, the minute this family gets
a legitimate foothold in the world,

06:08.285 --> 06:11.246
you try to drag us
back down into the jungle with you?

06:11.330 --> 06:13.498
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.501
I know it was you, Memo.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.170
Did you know Dad almost died that night?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.465
No. I didn't hear that.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.550
What happened?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.010
His fucking heart.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.930
Now I'm confused again.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.851
Isn't the old man dying exactly what
you've been waiting for?

06:33.435 --> 06:38.815
All I want is for at least one of
us to make him proud.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.900
Wow.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.320
I got it wrong! I thought
you were just counting the days until…

06:43.904 --> 06:45.322
You're pathetic.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.783
You're an embarrassment.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.786
Vicious fucking amateur.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.706
You've earned every bit
of the contempt we have for you.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.083
That accent.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.417
Is it new?

06:59.795 --> 07:02.798
You sound like the perfect "Whitina."

07:03.340 --> 07:05.926
You and your merry band
of reprobates with Isela.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.971
Your disgraceful association with cartels,

07:09.972 --> 07:12.140
fortunately it's about to end.

07:12.224 --> 07:16.937
I am deeply sorry your investors
felt fearful and indecisive.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.231
That development's moving ahead,

07:19.898 --> 07:21.567
no matter what stunts you pull.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.778
Give me their names.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.071
What names?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.490
The assholes that pulled this shit.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.701
How would I know, Andrea?

07:31.285 --> 07:35.539
It sounds like
gringo environmentalists, radicals,

07:36.373 --> 07:37.958
some Banksy shit--

07:38.041 --> 07:39.042
Listen to me.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.545
If you know these guys,

07:42.337 --> 07:45.382
you need to quietly get rid of them.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.967
If they're caught--

07:47.050 --> 07:48.760
If you're with them--

07:48.844 --> 07:52.472
Anyone who gets in the way
of this project will pay.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.016
You'd best go away.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.642
Father will be down shortly.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.647
Go.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.457
Morning.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.791
Good morning.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.676
Where are you going?

08:31.762 --> 08:34.681
Doing a favor for the guy
that owns the land.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.933
Little work to pay the rent.

08:38.936 --> 08:42.438
I thought the people owned the place.
What happened to that?

08:42.940 --> 08:45.442
Yeah, well, there's always a landlord.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.362
Turns out we're all just fucking renters.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.698
Hey, Dad? Mom told me.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.291
Told you what?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.503
About that guy. Richard.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.713
And the lab.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.021
Is that it?

09:23.522 --> 09:24.523
And…

09:25.858 --> 09:27.150
that they killed someone.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.444
Some girl.

09:29.528 --> 09:33.031
Your mom's timing. Never not shitty.

09:34.157 --> 09:38.412
And that you've let us blame you.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.290
Well, me.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.000
You've let me blame you.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.504
Sorry.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.549
Hey, you got nothing to be sorry for.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.177
-What?
-You didn't do anything wrong.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.054
Yeah, you don't think I fucking know that?

09:56.555 --> 09:57.556
No, Dad.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.767
I didn't mean it that way.

10:02.019 --> 10:06.773
Look, I mean, all these years,
I've been blaming you.

10:08.483 --> 10:13.780
I've been really shitty
to you about everything.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.741
Look, maybe it's great timing.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.786
Perfect age to start hating not just one,
but maybe both parents.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.539
Probably just
made your shrink a millionaire.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.334
It's not funny, Dad.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.418
Yeah.

10:27.211 --> 10:31.215
And I don't hate either of you.
It's worse than that.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.343
How so?

10:34.843 --> 10:39.014
Well, it just makes sense now.
How fucked up both of you are.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.851
Dina--

10:42.935 --> 10:46.605
No, I just think, at a certain point,

10:47.898 --> 10:51.318
you leading the way
and fucking things up for us.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.364
And saying,
"We're doing this because we're a family."

10:56.281 --> 11:01.662
And Mom saying the dumbest shit like,
"Your father knows what he's doing."

11:02.329 --> 11:05.332
Or, you know, you both saying you love us,

11:05.415 --> 11:07.501
and never once fucking acting like it.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.796
And it all just being so fucking awful.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.757
I just--

11:15.801 --> 11:16.885
I just realized…

11:19.346 --> 11:20.472
I don't respect you.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.894
And now, I don't respect her.

11:27.813 --> 11:32.985
So, no. That's not what I mean when I say,
"I'm sorry."

11:35.863 --> 11:39.950
I'm not sorry for anything.
Anything at all.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.035
I'm sorry for you.

11:43.912 --> 11:49.001
Your mother and I never once
did anything without first considering--

11:49.084 --> 11:50.085
You.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.798
-I only ever did what I did to benefit--
-You.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.597
Well, you seem pretty dug in.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.851
And that makes it a tough position
to argue against.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.354
I'm not arguing, Dad. It's a fact.

12:11.565 --> 12:16.653
I wanna leave. Now. Today.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.738
Is that so?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.116
You really wanna go?

12:24.953 --> 12:25.954
Go.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.416
Door's right there, but let's be clear.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.710
You use it, and it locks behind you.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.378
Wanna go to college? That's great.

12:33.462 --> 12:37.090
High time you started learning
absolutely zero.

12:39.885 --> 12:43.889
Happy for you, honey bear.
Best of luck with that.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.893
What? You wanna go get a degree in what,
Economics?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.062
Communications?

12:53.315 --> 12:55.567
Maybe get soaked with your girlfriends
on the weekends.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.945
Snapchat with your boyfriends.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.739
Get 'em to come.
Might even settle down with one of 'em.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.576
Sit at home. You can order in.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.996
Order a bunch of crap online,
plastic shit for your apartment.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.541
What a cool adventure
you're about to go on,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.585
smack-dab into the center
of a huge cliché.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.463
Could not be prouder of my little girl.

13:17.548 --> 13:21.009
You're all grown up. I'm so happy for you.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.555
Well, wish I could join you.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.641
Safe travels.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.143
You're a bully.

13:31.937 --> 13:32.980
There she is.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.482
You're sounding
like you already graduated.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.817
Fuck you.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.624
Just passing through.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.293
I doubt it.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.840
Look, my intention is not
to cause any problems.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.177
Tad late for that.

15:32.933 --> 15:33.934
What?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.270
I'm worried.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.147
I'm worried about Charlie.

15:41.692 --> 15:42.776
You don't get to be.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.656
I know.
It's just he came to my place yesterday,

15:47.739 --> 15:51.702
and he threatened me, basically.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.954
Really? You're twice his size.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.039
He had a gun.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.094
Where did he get it?

16:10.554 --> 16:11.555
It was mine.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.266
I'll talk to him.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.059
What are you gonna say?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.562
That he's not allowed to shoot you.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.022
Oh, well, that's nice to hear.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.191
I'm really sorry.

16:24.735 --> 16:25.736
Is he okay?

16:29.698 --> 16:30.866
No.

16:30.949 --> 16:31.950
Are you okay?

16:32.701 --> 16:33.702
No.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.874
Why are you here? What do you want?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.710
Well, I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.671
I don't wanna fuck up your life, Margot.

16:45.297 --> 16:49.760
Isela brought me here to do something
for someone important,

16:49.843 --> 16:51.094
and then I'll be gone.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.438
Fuck it.

17:03.524 --> 17:04.525
Come on.

17:08.237 --> 17:09.238
Are you coming?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.949
You wanted to know why I'm here, right?

17:13.534 --> 17:14.535
Well, come on.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.511
Here. Put this on.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.706
First-day nerves?

18:55.844 --> 18:56.845
Now you.

18:58.514 --> 18:59.515
Okay boys…

18:59.598 --> 19:00.724
Okay.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.811
Okay.

19:07.648 --> 19:08.649
No.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.243
One second.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.418
Sup?

19:28.961 --> 19:31.004
You know what Dad says about these things.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.758
Religion is just an overture
to ignorance in A-flat.

19:35.551 --> 19:40.722
This isn't like--
It's not like a Jesus religious thing.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.561
They build this effigy of Judas,

19:45.644 --> 19:48.313
and then you're supposed to, like,

19:48.397 --> 19:52.734
fill it with the things you hate in
the world like injustice or unfairness.

19:52.818 --> 19:56.321
And then you take the stuff
you don't like in yourself, like…

19:57.406 --> 20:00.617
regret, or guilt.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.495
Or, like, you know--

20:03.579 --> 20:07.165
Just, like, stuff that makes you feel bad
or you wish you could take back.

20:07.749 --> 20:12.129
Anyway, you're supposed to just take
that stuff and put it in him

20:12.212 --> 20:17.301
and then, I don't know,
like, just burn him, I guess.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.845
It's supposed to be, like, therapeutic.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.389
What?

20:22.931 --> 20:24.224
You have friends.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.816
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.695
I really like it here, Dina.

20:37.321 --> 20:40.616
I know you don't, but I like it.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.914
What's wrong? Are you okay?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.668
So, you talked to Dad about what we know?

20:52.878 --> 20:55.589
Yeah. We had a big fight.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.008
Did you make him mad?

21:01.553 --> 21:02.971
Charlie, I was mad.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.350
Charlie.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.102
Come, help me.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.482
Okay.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.620
-Shit, sorry. Go away.
-No, no.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.123
Do you want me to go? I--

22:11.206 --> 22:13.125
No, stay. I'm okay.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.796
I just-- I hate people seeing me cry.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.390
What's wrong?

22:28.974 --> 22:30.017
Everything…

22:31.810 --> 22:35.898
I thought I knew is just-- is fucked up.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.532
I know the truth about some things.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.492
It's supposed to be good…

22:50.370 --> 22:52.372
but it makes me feel…

22:55.167 --> 22:56.251
worse.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.337
It's a waste.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.131
I can't stand the way I feel.

23:01.215 --> 23:05.761
I'm so, so mad at my mom and dad.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.806
Maybe you're being too harsh.
Give them a chance.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.810
You don't know what you're talking about.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.023
All right.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.818
My dad drank and killed himself
when I was eight.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.279
Shot himself in the head.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.740
I'm sorry.

23:27.407 --> 23:31.787
I was raised by my grandfather.
He died when I was 13.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.540
So, Ridley took me in.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.125
Do you still live with him?

23:37.626 --> 23:41.839
Ridley? No. I live downriver.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.590
I have a place.

23:46.718 --> 23:50.347
If you had a million dollars,
what would you do?

23:51.390 --> 23:55.310
Million dollars? I would--

23:56.937 --> 23:58.146
I think I'd buy a house.

23:59.857 --> 24:02.985
Buy a house in the capital. Go to school.

24:03.986 --> 24:07.239
Me too. In New York.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.784
No one would know me there.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.411
Or Miami.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.162
Or Portland.

24:16.790 --> 24:17.791
Boulder.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.896
Thanks for coming.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.316
-I missed breakfast.
-No.

24:43.066 --> 24:47.029
Big weekend here. You Easter much, Allie?

24:47.112 --> 24:50.532
Down on your knees, praying to some power
greater than yourself?

24:51.575 --> 24:53.035
Church? Nah.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.955
If God hadn't rested on the seventh day,
he might have gotten the job done.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.832
Why should I make the same mistake?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.084
I figured as much.

25:01.627 --> 25:05.297
You sure? Anyone? Bacon?

25:05.380 --> 25:08.217
-I'm good. Thank you kindly.
-Then let's get to it.

25:09.968 --> 25:12.054
It's about business, of course.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.931
We're a family who's dutifully delivered

25:14.014 --> 25:19.019
whatever the world has asked us
to provide for two centuries.

25:19.102 --> 25:23.649
Cochineal dye, indigo, sisal and henequen.

25:24.525 --> 25:25.901
Fucking bananas.

25:26.652 --> 25:29.488
And most recently, drogas. Cocaína.

25:30.239 --> 25:32.783
Well, if it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.286
Yeah, we're just niche players.

25:36.370 --> 25:41.500
I'm just mom-and-pop. Boutique.
But I control every route.

25:41.583 --> 25:45.712
Provide passage to cargo moving
through a very large territory.

25:46.255 --> 25:49.007
There are hazards.
Every business has some.

25:49.550 --> 25:52.135
Mine happens to be police interference.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.888
And I need you to help me make
that go away.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.515
So, meet Caleb.

26:01.144 --> 26:05.023
-He's going to help you.
-Hello, Allie.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.817
Big fan of your early work.

26:07.484 --> 26:11.196
At MIT and Cambridge Analytica,
Sandpiper is a legend.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.825
You created a program that can predict
any kind of movement, pattern.

26:15.325 --> 26:16.577
Many have tried to replicate it.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.998
Caleb's been hard at work
processing the data for your arrival.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.292
Took me quite some time to find a Caleb.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.169
And a hefty recruiter's fee.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.671
What does any of this mean to me?

26:28.380 --> 26:31.133
We want your algorithm. We want Sandpiper.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.217
To do what?

26:32.301 --> 26:35.637
Use it to analyze and predict
the movement of law enforcement agencies.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.598
No police interference, no problems.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.766
My routes will be safe,
and everyone will be happy.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.060
I just need you to download it for us.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.897
Show Caleb how it works.
Hand over the keys.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.399
I'd love to get my hands
on your Rosetta stone.

26:47.482 --> 26:51.236
And that's it. Job done.
Go about your life at Casa Roja.

26:51.737 --> 26:52.738
Live it up.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.609
Look at what they've done to this jungle.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.946
The destruction of land and wildlife.

27:34.029 --> 27:35.447
Corporate greed and corruption.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.992
When Isela told me about this,
I had to get involved.

27:39.076 --> 27:42.788
I had to do something.
We have to do something.

27:45.207 --> 27:48.418
We did make a difference, you and I.

27:50.921 --> 27:54.299
The lab shut down. The company went bust.

27:54.883 --> 27:58.178
They stopped genetic-modified material
from entering the food chain.

27:58.887 --> 28:02.933
We saved the world, just a little bit.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.061
We were a good team.

28:06.144 --> 28:07.604
My life ended and…

28:09.189 --> 28:10.691
yours is just beginning.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.819
You made a name for yourself.

28:15.821 --> 28:16.989
What?

28:18.240 --> 28:23.453
It's just hard for me to take that in,
that we made a difference, is all.

28:32.171 --> 28:36.675
No. Not happening.

28:38.135 --> 28:39.136
Sorry, Caleb.

28:39.845 --> 28:41.096
Not gonna do it with him.

28:41.722 --> 28:45.142
You are doing it with him.
Caleb's culled the data.

28:45.893 --> 28:49.104
This thing is mine. I created it.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.108
People tried to take it from me once.
Didn't end well.

28:54.902 --> 28:58.614
If this is gonna work for you,
then you need me.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.742
No one else. Just me.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.453
My, my, my.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.289
What's gotten into Allie Fox?

29:07.372 --> 29:08.790
What can I tell you?

29:09.458 --> 29:12.211
This guy get all up in his feelings,
but he means it.

29:17.341 --> 29:18.509
I'm sorry, Caleb.

29:18.592 --> 29:21.303
It appears we no longer
require your services.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.263
Mr. Lee will escort you out.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.726
But you promised me
a three-month contract.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.273
Step this way, kid.

29:34.066 --> 29:35.275
This sucks.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.364
You're sure about this?

29:49.456 --> 29:50.916
You know she had a son?

29:51.500 --> 29:52.709
Alison Caffrey?

29:53.502 --> 29:55.671
His father remarried when he was five.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.382
He has two sisters and a baby brother.

30:01.134 --> 30:04.721
For a long time,
I couldn't think of anything else.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.682
What happened that night…

30:09.309 --> 30:11.645
was terrible, Margot.

30:55.564 --> 30:56.648
Who are they?

30:56.732 --> 30:59.902
Andrea Bautista and Carter Albrecht.

31:00.527 --> 31:01.820
And who are they?

31:02.529 --> 31:06.074
The same people whose event
your husband disrupted.

31:07.492 --> 31:08.952
The developers.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.941
Got any more of these, anywhere?

32:21.024 --> 32:22.025
Fuck you.

32:23.068 --> 32:25.028
We just do what Guillermo says.

32:25.112 --> 32:26.947
We take what we want.

32:27.030 --> 32:30.367
It's part of keeping you all
nice and safe.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.995
You don't like it, talk to Guillermo.

33:06.612 --> 33:08.572
Like the National Archives.

33:09.573 --> 33:11.200
Bienvenido to your work space.

33:25.339 --> 33:27.925
Ancient bookkeeping
from your drug trade won't work.

33:28.008 --> 33:29.551
It has to be current information.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.553
Should be sufficient to run Sandpiper.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.515
I need to know all your routes.
Who's involved.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.350
Dates. Times. Vehicles.

33:36.433 --> 33:40.354
Sandpiper can predict police interference
if we enter all the information you have.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.397
Everything. You understand?

33:42.481 --> 33:46.193
Understood, yes. Most is on floppy disks.

33:46.777 --> 33:51.073
And all of this is the data
that Caleb entered.

33:52.783 --> 33:56.912
So, put your brain to good use,
and show me.

33:59.206 --> 34:01.041
You've got 72 hours.

34:03.377 --> 34:06.588
You just put your family
on the line, so get to work.

34:41.331 --> 34:45.418
You're right.
We were a good team. We still can be.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.090
I want to help.

34:53.510 --> 34:55.179
I don't think Allie would like that.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.473
Don't worry about Allie. Okay?
He won't get in the way.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.074
You got some money?

35:17.117 --> 35:19.453
-Yeah, a bit. Why?
-I just wanna get some waters.

35:22.414 --> 35:23.624
You want anything else?

35:24.124 --> 35:26.210
No, I'm good.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.275
Hola.

35:50.359 --> 35:51.360
Hola.

36:19.513 --> 36:22.224
I like your phone. Do you want to sell it?

36:49.168 --> 36:51.044
What the hell?

37:06.351 --> 37:07.519
What the fuck was that?

37:09.354 --> 37:11.148
The price we pay to our landlord.

37:11.773 --> 37:14.109
His traffickers get to help themselves
to whatever they want,

37:14.193 --> 37:15.277
whenever they want it.

37:24.369 --> 37:27.664
Sure hope you didn't talk yourself
into a real pickle up there.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.668
Seventy-two hours goes mighty fast.

38:51.498 --> 38:52.583
Hit him!

39:12.060 --> 39:13.395
How did it go?

39:15.939 --> 39:17.107
How'd it go?

39:17.608 --> 39:20.694
As expected. He wants Sandpiper.

39:21.403 --> 39:24.489
I've kept it safe for this long.
Now it's in the hands of a drug lord.

39:27.993 --> 39:28.994
Dina told me.

39:31.163 --> 39:32.456
Yeah, she's in pain.

39:38.921 --> 39:39.922
Interesting.

39:40.631 --> 39:41.757
What?

39:45.177 --> 39:46.386
I thought you wouldn't notice.

39:50.807 --> 39:51.808
Just…

39:54.394 --> 39:58.065
There's something I need to tell you
about Charlie.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.859
He put a gun to Richard's head
and pulled the trigger.

40:01.485 --> 40:02.486
Sorry, he what?

40:03.070 --> 40:04.112
It wasn't loaded.

40:08.242 --> 40:09.993
-All right.
-"All right" what?

40:10.077 --> 40:11.328
All right, I get it.

40:11.411 --> 40:13.747
"All right,"
you're gonna help me get them back?

40:16.667 --> 40:19.461
Sure. Maybe. Or maybe something else.

40:20.504 --> 40:21.922
What something else?

40:23.882 --> 40:25.384
Good evening.

40:25.467 --> 40:28.971
We don't all share the same ideas

40:29.763 --> 40:30.764
or beliefs.

40:31.765 --> 40:35.686
But let this be a time to reflect

40:35.769 --> 40:40.065
on the things we do to one another.

40:40.148 --> 40:44.027
Acts that may be violent, cruel,

40:44.111 --> 40:45.237
petty,

40:45.946 --> 40:47.865
or that violate

40:47.948 --> 40:52.828
the deep trusts
that we have sworn to protect.

40:53.579 --> 40:56.123
The promises
that we have made to each other.

40:59.626 --> 41:01.211
We all make mistakes

41:02.212 --> 41:03.380
for many reasons.

41:03.922 --> 41:05.174
We overstep.

41:06.133 --> 41:07.467
We do not comply.

41:08.677 --> 41:10.012
In moments,

41:10.846 --> 41:12.347
we compromise the cause.

41:12.431 --> 41:13.515
In this ceremony…

41:15.601 --> 41:17.644
where we burn away our sins

41:18.520 --> 41:20.522
some don't leave us quite so easily.

41:25.027 --> 41:27.029
We need to work on those faults.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.199
Pay attention to them.

41:33.202 --> 41:35.579
I know
that I am paying attention to my own.

41:36.205 --> 41:37.581
I promised you shelter…

41:39.833 --> 41:40.834
community,

41:42.419 --> 41:43.420
refuge,

41:45.255 --> 41:46.840
and safety from your enemies.

41:49.927 --> 41:50.969
Our enemies.

41:52.054 --> 41:55.265
If I betray that promise…

41:57.684 --> 41:58.727
I am the Judas.

42:58.662 --> 43:00.747
What something else, Allie?

43:01.248 --> 43:03.667
I might have found us a new solution.

43:04.501 --> 43:06.879
No. No more pie-in-the-sky bullshit.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.385
Sandpiper is up and running.
Now I just need to run the data.

43:13.468 --> 43:17.222
Good. Finish up that pile
on your desk. Then we can go.
