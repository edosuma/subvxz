WEBVTT

00:04.795 --> 00:06.216
Previously, on Beyond...

00:06.217 --> 00:07.387
Hollow Sky's been alerted
to a young man

00:07.388 --> 00:09.089
with special abilities.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.720
Your services are required.

00:10.721 --> 00:12.892
Am I the first girl to be
brought up to your bedroom?

00:12.893 --> 00:16.226
One of the gazillion things I missed was...
hangin' out with girls.

00:16.227 --> 00:17.307
There, I said it.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.439
The people that killed my
brother are after your son.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.770
I need your help.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.733
Ian agreed to wait up
for Holden with me.

00:23.734 --> 00:26.146
That's a kind gesture.
Doesn't go unnoticed.

00:26.147 --> 00:28.568
I know we had something.
That's what matters.

00:28.569 --> 00:29.859
It's not just about us.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.151
It was all so I could
go back in.

00:31.152 --> 00:33.493
- For him, for Arthur?
- It's complicated.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.205
Let me know
when you uncomplicate it.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.246
I'm looking for Holden.

00:36.247 --> 00:37.707
He's not here.

00:37.708 --> 00:38.828
This is my number.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.330
Could you tell him to call me?

00:40.331 --> 00:44.043
The year I went into my coma,
I was supposed to visit

00:44.044 --> 00:46.426
this telescope in Colorado.

00:46.427 --> 00:47.968
Of course I never got to see it.

00:53.134 --> 00:55.975
Wait, is it the emperor
or the prince in the carriage?

00:55.976 --> 00:57.517
- The prince, c'mon. Keep up.
- Okay.

00:57.518 --> 01:00.140
So the... the prince is traveling
through the countryside?

01:00.141 --> 01:02.142
In disguise, yeah.
He wants to see

01:02.143 --> 01:05.235
how common folk will treat him if
they don't know he's royal blood.

01:05.236 --> 01:08.568
But what he realizes is he
actually likes being special.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.191
Problem is, by the time he
returns to the Forbidden City,

01:11.192 --> 01:14.114
his father,
the emperor, had died,

01:14.115 --> 01:16.866
and no one will recognize him
as the crown prince.

01:16.867 --> 01:20.160
So he has to just go on living the
rest of his life as a regular Joe...

01:20.161 --> 01:21.752
er, Xiao.

01:23.003 --> 01:25.084
I feel like I'm supposed to be
taking something from this.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.206
You say you want a normal life.

01:26.207 --> 01:27.257
I do wanna have a normal life.

01:27.258 --> 01:28.708
Nobody wants to have
a normal life.

01:28.709 --> 01:31.090
And what... what the hell
is normal anyway?

01:31.091 --> 01:34.924
For starters, not...
going into a 12-year coma.

01:34.925 --> 01:37.847
Not... setting houses
on fire with my mind.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.888
- Or...
- Super powers?

01:38.889 --> 01:40.019
'Cause you're special.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.021
I'm not special and they're not...
super powers.

01:42.022 --> 01:45.645
Okay, what would the normal 25-year-old
Holden Matthews be doing in his normal life

01:45.646 --> 01:46.896
right now?

01:46.897 --> 01:49.779
I woulda... you know,
graduated college.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.031
Have a job.

01:52.573 --> 01:54.113
Building telescopes.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.945
You know and...
maybe even build one

01:55.946 --> 01:58.077
to send to outer space
like the Hubble.

01:58.078 --> 02:01.411
I... I built a telescope when
I was 13, the summer before.

02:01.412 --> 02:05.004
God, when you talk like that,
all enthusiastic and smart,

02:05.005 --> 02:09.008
I... I just... I just wonder is there
really no limit to your space nerdiness?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.051
Thanks.

02:12.052 --> 02:13.513
Oh, my god, did you see
that milkshake?

02:13.514 --> 02:16.216
- You want one?
- Oh... Yes! No, no!

02:16.217 --> 02:18.558
It's... It's like
a million calories.

02:18.559 --> 02:20.180
Don't think you have to worry
about calories.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.102
You haven't seen me naked.

02:26.977 --> 02:30.029
So... speaking of not-normal,

02:30.030 --> 02:32.903
I dare you to totally blow these
normal people's minds right now.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.945
And how would I do that?

02:35.946 --> 02:40.411
Do something subtle, like, change the
god-awful music on that jukebox.

02:44.124 --> 02:47.208
C'mon. Let's get psionic
up in this bitch.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.751
Okay.

02:51.752 --> 02:55.555
Okay. Remember, focus on a specific point.
Stare inside it.

02:55.556 --> 02:56.887
Shh! I'm workin' on it.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.785 --> 03:26.706
- Oh, yep, we should bounce now.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.788
- Go, go... go, go!

03:28.789 --> 03:30.290
Oh, my god, that was amazing!

03:30.291 --> 03:32.041
I was trying to change the
music, not cause a blackout!

03:32.042 --> 03:33.794
Blackout's way better, dude!

03:35.005 --> 03:37.176
Got you somethin'.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.838
C'mon, you know you want it.

03:38.839 --> 03:41.471
Couple sips is only like
25,000 thousand calories.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.553
Mmm!

03:44.104 --> 03:45.225
Let's go!

03:51.151 --> 03:52.982
So he just lit out
in the middle of the night?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.153
It wasn't the middle
of the night.

03:54.154 --> 03:55.985
He asked if they could go
and I said yes.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.408
What's at Mt. Remick?
350 miles away.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.989
Remember that observatory
that he talked

03:59.990 --> 04:01.321
nonstop about when he was a kid?

04:01.322 --> 04:02.412
Who's the girl?

04:02.413 --> 04:03.863
Charlie, she's very sweet.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.205
Who... who's Charlie?

04:06.206 --> 04:07.707
Apparently your brother
took off on a road trip

04:07.708 --> 04:09.289
with some girl named Charlie.

04:09.290 --> 04:13.963
Huh. Yeah, first it was Jamie
and then Willa, and...

04:13.964 --> 04:15.004
- Who's Jamie?
- Who's Willa?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.137
Or was it Willa first?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.470
So, what, you just let him
leave, Mom?

04:20.471 --> 04:23.473
I didn't just let him leave,
he's 25 years old.

04:23.474 --> 04:26.055
- We gave him a truck.
- Which needs a new timing chain.

04:26.056 --> 04:27.807
And I'm not gonna stop
him from catching up

04:27.808 --> 04:29.560
on some of the things
that he missed.

04:30.851 --> 04:32.602
I worry about him, too.

04:32.603 --> 04:34.154
I'm really late for work.

04:35.696 --> 04:37.197
That is old.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.962
Do you have a reservation?

05:42.963 --> 05:45.925
No, uh... is that a problem?

05:45.926 --> 05:49.929
Oh... I just got a cancellation
on Cabin 4.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.811
Great! Um... we'll take it.

05:51.812 --> 05:53.733
If you don't,
somebody else will!

05:53.734 --> 05:57.106
If you could just sign
my ledger here,

05:57.107 --> 05:58.648
Mr. and Mrs....

05:58.649 --> 06:00.149
Matthews.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.361
Mr. and Mrs. Holden Matthews.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.864
Of Fort Reed, Kansas.
We're newlyweds.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.536
Kansas, huh? Beautiful country.

06:06.537 --> 06:07.577
You been?

06:07.578 --> 06:09.749
No.
Uh, but my sister-in-law...

06:09.750 --> 06:11.871
My former sister-in-law...

06:11.872 --> 06:14.203
she spoke very highly
of the Buckeye State.

06:14.204 --> 06:15.125
Jayhawk State.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.255
Come again?

06:16.256 --> 06:19.419
Nothing. Um... the cabin,

06:19.420 --> 06:22.001
it's, uh... it's got two beds?

06:22.002 --> 06:25.465
Why would we need
two beds, dear?

06:25.466 --> 06:28.348
Unless you're expecting
company on our honeymoon?

06:44.114 --> 06:45.324
- Um...
- Boy, she's funny.

06:45.325 --> 06:47.947
She's... she is great, um...

06:47.948 --> 06:50.790
- What do you want?
- You don't call,

06:50.791 --> 06:53.993
you don't write.
How's our project coming along?

06:53.994 --> 06:57.296
I don't... I don't know
what you think Holden can do,

06:57.297 --> 06:59.338
or what Frost wants with him,

06:59.339 --> 07:02.041
but... I've been looking
over my shoulder

07:02.042 --> 07:04.003
ever since I woke up,
and I'm not gonna

07:04.004 --> 07:05.345
do that to Holden.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.007
I shoulda told you
in Monte Carlo

07:08.008 --> 07:09.098
you can go...

07:09.099 --> 07:11.220
You like him.

07:11.221 --> 07:12.472
How adorable.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.893
But that doesn't change
our deal.

07:13.894 --> 07:15.104
You help bring in Holden,

07:15.105 --> 07:17.106
and we help you get Arthur.

07:17.107 --> 07:21.110
Arthur will get what's coming
to him, Holden or no Holden.

07:21.111 --> 07:23.483
You might want to rethink
your position.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.865
Oh, is this where you tell me
that you'll get your hooks

07:25.866 --> 07:28.027
in Holden with or without
my help?

07:28.028 --> 07:30.199
No. This is where I tell you
a story

07:30.200 --> 07:32.031
about a bright 15-year-old

07:32.032 --> 07:35.035
in Oregon named Annabelle.

07:35.996 --> 07:38.788
I... I don't... I don't know
who that is.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.419
You don't remember the
foster sister you befriended

07:40.420 --> 07:42.131
back in the day?

07:42.132 --> 07:45.715
You are still paying for her posh
boarding school, aren't you?

07:45.716 --> 07:47.887
- Stay away from Anna.
- I would hate to see her thrust

07:47.888 --> 07:50.179
back into the inner city
foster care system

07:50.180 --> 07:51.931
you're so familiar with.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.853
I will kill you!

07:53.854 --> 07:58.227
I will destroy Hollow Sky, I will burn down
the entire building and everybody in it!

07:58.228 --> 08:00.309
Now, Charlie, is that any way
for you to talk to an old...

08:00.310 --> 08:03.312
God... dammit!

08:03.313 --> 08:05.776
Ohhh! God!

08:16.577 --> 08:21.081
Sorry if I sounded distracted, I...
I can't say I expected your call.

08:22.122 --> 08:25.125
Can't really say I...
expected you to answer.

08:26.887 --> 08:29.389
Is everything okay...
with Holden?

08:31.051 --> 08:33.342
I don't... know...

08:33.342 --> 08:34.845
how to say this, so I'm...

08:35.976 --> 08:38.638
I'm just gonna say it.

08:38.639 --> 08:41.311
Who the hell are you, and... and
what do you want with my brother?

08:42.643 --> 08:46.066
Me, I... we're just friends.

08:47.818 --> 08:52.151
See, uh... I can tell
a bad liar from a good liar.

08:52.152 --> 08:54.284
And you're terrible.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.078
Look, I'm helping
with Holden's rehab.

08:59.419 --> 09:01.791
Holden quit physical therapy
weeks ago.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.462
Do you wanna go
for strike three,

09:03.463 --> 09:05.085
or do you just wanna skip
to the truth?

09:15.886 --> 09:18.679
Holden drew these, and...

09:32.362 --> 09:33.904
and you know what they are.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.077
Don't you?

09:47.047 --> 09:51.341
This... is where your brother was...
when he was in his coma.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.268
Wh... What are you...?

10:02.522 --> 10:03.774
But that's crazy.

10:06.026 --> 10:07.527
Sounds crazy, but...

10:10.570 --> 10:12.072
more than that, you need
to ask him.

10:13.153 --> 10:14.364
I'm sorry.

10:26.336 --> 10:27.917
So what're we looking for?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.959
The main event is Mercury
in retrograde.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.713
It'll look like the planet
is actually moving backwards.

10:34.214 --> 10:35.554
But it's... not?

10:35.555 --> 10:37.136
No, but it does slow down.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.929
See, it's the only planet
whose orbit speed changes,

10:39.930 --> 10:43.262
so, Earth is moving the same
speed while Mercury slows down,

10:43.263 --> 10:45.064
so it seems like
it's moving... backwards.

10:45.065 --> 10:48.898
- Ohh.
- Okay. C'mere. Take a look.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.529
Okay.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.613
Look for the brightest object
in the sky above the moon.

10:55.575 --> 10:57.156
Oh, yeah, I see it.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.039
I... I think, maybe.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.042
- Maybe. Uh...
- Don't worry.

11:03.043 --> 11:05.124
Once we go inside and look
through the big telescope,

11:05.125 --> 11:07.787
it'll be like we're looking
right out the window.

11:07.788 --> 11:11.921
Then what are we doing out here
with this rinky-dink telescope?

11:11.922 --> 11:13.423
You mean the telescope I made?

11:16.797 --> 11:18.347
- Uh-oh.
- Hi, excuse me?

11:18.348 --> 11:22.561
Uh, we wanted to check out the Cassegrain
telescope inside, is there... a line

11:22.562 --> 11:25.935
- or a sign-in sheet?
- Unfortunately, we retired the 1/2 meter reflector

11:25.936 --> 11:27.978
from the public use
about three years ago.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.339
Okay, wait, wait... wait, wait...
hold... hold on... Brett.

11:32.072 --> 11:33.983
My friend was supposed
to come here in eighth grade,

11:33.984 --> 11:37.156
but he never made it to
eighth grade, because he...

11:37.157 --> 11:39.989
fell off his motorcycle,
and went into a 12-year coma,

11:39.990 --> 11:42.872
and now he's awake, and we
came all the way from Kansas

11:42.873 --> 11:46.416
so he could see Mercury
through your big telescope.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.589
Really?

11:51.091 --> 11:53.132
I'm serious! He was
in a coma!

11:53.133 --> 11:55.005
Yeah, sorry.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.890
Wow.

12:02.642 --> 12:05.054
My motto is, ask forgiveness,
not permission,

12:05.055 --> 12:08.187
and don't ask
for forgiveness either.

12:08.188 --> 12:09.980
We're totally gonna get caught.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.655
Cool, huh?

12:16.656 --> 12:18.118
Dome's closed.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.992
That's why we're gonna
open the dome.

12:23.073 --> 12:25.075
Okay, there must be a, uh...

12:26.076 --> 12:27.126
Ah! There it is!

12:27.127 --> 12:28.498
- Here.
- Thank you.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.632
Is that gonna make noise?

12:33.633 --> 12:38.138
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah, we're totally gonna get caught.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.023
Yes! Wicked good. We're in luck. It's
mostly pointed in the right direction,

12:54.024 --> 12:55.155
I think.

12:58.158 --> 13:01.110
Oh... why this...

13:01.111 --> 13:05.035
this is amazing, it's right there, here...
take a look!

13:08.328 --> 13:11.370
Wait...
Oh m... I can see it!

13:11.371 --> 13:14.914
It's very slow, but it should
look like it's moving backward.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.085
Oh, my god!

13:16.086 --> 13:18.838
You know, according to superstition, a...
a retrograde Mercury

13:18.839 --> 13:21.221
brings bad luck, and can totally
screw up your love life.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.055
What are you saying?

13:26.056 --> 13:28.228
You and me aren't gonna
fall into orbit?

13:34.484 --> 13:36.065
Hello?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.146
Hide!

13:37.147 --> 13:38.317
Here!

13:38.318 --> 13:39.819
Down!

13:41.151 --> 13:42.282
Someone in here?

13:50.210 --> 13:51.411
Door. Door, go!

13:52.832 --> 13:53.874
Hey!

13:55.005 --> 13:56.046
Go, go, go, go, go!

14:00.510 --> 14:04.553
Well, it's Mediterranean
contemporary. It's open concept,

14:04.554 --> 14:07.596
Brazilian cherry hardwood
floors throughout.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.268
Walk-in wine cellar,

14:09.269 --> 14:12.391
gourmet kitchen with
granite countertops...

14:12.392 --> 14:16.775
- How are the schools?
- Great. This is a gated community, so, you know,

14:16.776 --> 14:18.477
inside these walls,
you're as safe as milk.

14:18.478 --> 14:21.070
- You folks are pre-approved, right?
- Oh, yeah, uh...

14:21.071 --> 14:23.032
he just got a big bonus
from the home office.

14:23.033 --> 14:26.115
Plus a little extra for
getting banged up on the job.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.156
Which I'm sure you noticed.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.748
Golden handcuffs
are more like it.

14:29.749 --> 14:31.160
Indefinite paid leave.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.083
Excuse me for a second.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.374
Here.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.087
So what do you think?
It's pretty nice, huh?

14:38.088 --> 14:40.050
Well, it's on a golf course.

14:41.841 --> 14:43.002
What do you think, Spartacus?

14:43.003 --> 14:46.005
- Hmm?
- Oh... you love it just like Mama, don't you?

14:46.006 --> 14:48.097
Hmm? Yes, yes you do.

14:48.098 --> 14:49.558
Why don't I show you
the upstairs?

14:49.559 --> 14:51.220
There's a gorgeous master suite,

14:51.221 --> 14:52.641
his and her walk-ins...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.273
Sorry, he's, uh,
a little cranky.

14:54.274 --> 14:57.107
Sitting around the house
doesn't suit him.

14:58.478 --> 15:02.652
Well, Spartacus...
this ain't our world, pal.

15:24.384 --> 15:27.886
- It won't work if you don't focus.
- I am focusing.

15:27.887 --> 15:30.469
Or trying to.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.012
We've been sitting here for 10
minutes and the lamp is still off.

15:33.013 --> 15:35.264
You were the one bragging about
how you could help me with my...

15:35.265 --> 15:37.606
Mmm, but I'm not gonna say it.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.018
Powers!

15:39.019 --> 15:43.612
Okay, let's... let's recap,
how were you able to survive

15:43.613 --> 15:45.114
in the realm for so long?

15:45.115 --> 15:48.988
Apparently I could
manipulate the elements.

15:48.989 --> 15:54.784
So now in the real world, our theory is
I'm... tapping into atmospheric electricity.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.746
Our theory?

15:57.747 --> 16:02.581
Willa. I... I mentioned her to
you, she, uh... was helping me.

16:02.582 --> 16:06.005
Yeah, Willa and uh,
and Arthur, was it?

16:06.006 --> 16:09.589
- Yeah.
- He sounds like a real peach.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.643
Well, the whole... electricity in
the air thing is just a guess.

16:14.644 --> 16:16.145
You were different
when you came out, too.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.767
Right, but it's linked
is what I'm saying.

16:18.768 --> 16:22.191
I survived by being totally OCD,
charting storms and antibodies,

16:22.192 --> 16:26.235
and then... bam! I wake up from
my coma, and I can see patterns

16:26.236 --> 16:28.107
and algorithms.

16:28.108 --> 16:32.701
And after a lot of practice... I learned
to use those powers to my advantage.

16:32.702 --> 16:36.376
I know, but I don't even want
my... powers.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.211
See, that's your problem.

16:42.212 --> 16:46.175
You have to embrace
what you are.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.258
Have fun with Holden 2.0.

16:52.222 --> 16:54.224
But first, turn on
the damn lamp.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.016
Okay.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.709
- At least I turned it on.
- Yeah, for a second.

17:21.161 --> 17:23.922
You're unhappy we took you
off the Matthews case.

17:23.923 --> 17:27.045
I get that. And you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye

17:27.046 --> 17:28.467
on operational matters.

17:28.468 --> 17:31.470
But maybe, we need each other.

17:31.471 --> 17:33.092
What happened with the kid?

17:33.093 --> 17:36.265
Decision was made
to bring in a freelancer.

17:36.266 --> 17:38.517
To convince Holden
to meet with Frost.

17:38.518 --> 17:42.891
But... the thinking was
maybe... maybe someone

17:42.892 --> 17:45.184
more like him.

17:45.185 --> 17:46.896
Charlie Singer.

17:48.608 --> 17:50.359
You sent that nutjob
after Holden?

17:50.360 --> 17:53.822
It wasn't my decision.
But Frost is the boss.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.535
From the jump, I said we needed to bring
that kid in by any means necessary.

17:56.536 --> 18:00.829
You did. But I told you so doesn't
change the facts on the ground.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.543
We need to bring Holden in now.

18:05.415 --> 18:07.207
We're back to "we."

18:08.968 --> 18:15.013
I'm offering you an escape
hatch from all... this.

18:15.014 --> 18:18.056
And I'm big enough to admit that
you're the best man for the job.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.980
Are you big enough...
to accept?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.784
I'll need men and resources.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.238
You have carte Blanche.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.123
I went crazy when I first
woke up.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.915
And then I realized
what I could do.

18:46.916 --> 18:50.048
I'm not saying some of what I
can do isn't cool, it's just...

18:50.049 --> 18:51.049
That you wanna be normal.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.173
- That's a pipe dream.
- What?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.514
Hey!

18:55.515 --> 18:56.716
Hi!

18:58.218 --> 18:59.679
You two in the cabin next door?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.471
Um... yeah.

19:02.472 --> 19:05.264
- Are you having electricity issues? Our TV went out.
- Yeah.

19:05.265 --> 19:10.399
Really?
That's... so... weird!

19:10.400 --> 19:13.482
What are we doin' watchin' TV with all
this beautiful scenery anyway, eh?

19:13.483 --> 19:16.154
Phil Ferris.
My better half, Helen.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.078
Hi, um, Holden. Matthews.

19:20.580 --> 19:24.543
- And this is my, my wife.
- Charlie.

19:24.544 --> 19:26.164
We're from Kansas.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.207
We're down
from Canada ourselves.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.289
- Few days away from the kids.
- Two little terrors.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.592
I mean angels straight
from heaven.

19:36.135 --> 19:37.596
Can I see pictures?

19:37.597 --> 19:40.849
Oh, you don't have to be
polite, but, of course.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.641
I'm not tryin' to drum up
business, promise.

19:42.642 --> 19:44.853
Oh, they're so cute.

19:44.854 --> 19:47.516
Insurance?
Wow, that sounds, um...

19:47.517 --> 19:50.359
Incredibly boring, I know. But
it pays the bills, right?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.441
- That little one looks like trouble.
- There you go, that, uh...

19:52.442 --> 19:53.523
that works.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.498
Hey, Steve.

20:09.499 --> 20:13.171
Yeah, I'm just finishing up those
turbine engine bits as we speak.

20:13.172 --> 20:16.214
I'll send 'em out to you
in about five minutes.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.637
You got it. Bye.

20:18.638 --> 20:22.220
Sure you should be sneakin' outta
work to come meet with me?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.682
You said you had something
for me.

20:23.683 --> 20:24.724
What is it?

20:26.556 --> 20:27.847
What is this?

20:31.521 --> 20:32.981
Tax returns.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.355
On paper, all those
guys are religious work, right?

20:36.356 --> 20:40.158
Thing about religion nowadays? Even
the Pope has a Twitter account.

20:40.159 --> 20:44.414
But these guys, no publicity,
no social media. Now...

20:48.868 --> 20:52.040
Now there's chatter on the dark net
about a guy named Isaac Frost.

20:52.041 --> 20:55.083
All right, so what does Hollow Sky
or this Frost guy want with Holden?

20:55.084 --> 20:58.587
- Maybe nothin' but...
- How the hell did you get this?

20:58.588 --> 21:03.473
Hollow Sky has been stockpiling
assets. Liquid and real estate.

21:04.804 --> 21:06.886
And they've also been involved
in philanthropy...

21:07.887 --> 21:10.188
Youth-based charities.

21:10.189 --> 21:12.230
One of them's right here
in our backyard.

21:12.231 --> 21:14.152
"Fort Reed Helping Hands."

21:14.153 --> 21:17.026
- Yep. And it's run by...
- Pastor Ian Brachman.

21:21.110 --> 21:24.113
Son of a bitch
is dating my wife.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.467
Sure you don't wanna come?

21:38.468 --> 21:41.299
Oh, I'm gonna be up late
catching up on work as it is.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.052
Well, we could stop
at that diner.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.805
With the giant homemade
cinnamon rolls.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.347
Don't tempt me.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.019
Please don't take this the wrong
way, but regional pastor meetings

21:51.020 --> 21:52.981
aren't exactly my idea of fun.

21:52.982 --> 21:54.393
Me either.

21:54.394 --> 21:56.314
- It's my monthly penance.
- Mm.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.937
Thank you.

21:59.238 --> 22:01.029
So have you heard from Holden?

22:01.030 --> 22:02.741
Oh, he's having fun.

22:02.742 --> 22:06.284
He... He... He saw Mercury rising
or... something last night.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.036
He was so excited.

22:08.037 --> 22:09.368
Holden called?

22:09.369 --> 22:10.499
Yep.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.502
What? I sent him like
four text messages.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.714
'Sup Ian?

22:15.715 --> 22:20.338
Oh, same old. I heard you took
a sabbatical from school.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.171
Uh, just a semester off,
you know, I couldn't focus.

22:23.172 --> 22:24.843
I was worried about
my big brother.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.466
- Hm.
- I hope all those long hours on the couch

22:27.467 --> 22:29.177
watching Family Feud
are helping you cope.

22:29.178 --> 22:31.470
Okay... Uncle Steve
gets me through the day.

22:31.471 --> 22:33.231
- So does a job.
- Yeah... Okay... I'm looking

22:33.232 --> 22:35.143
for a job, and... and it's just
a semester.

22:35.144 --> 22:37.105
We can always use some helping
hands down at the Youth Center.

22:37.106 --> 22:41.279
- Because the Youth Center is called "Helping...
- "Hands."

22:41.280 --> 22:43.322
Yeah, I, uh... I got it.

22:44.904 --> 22:48.117
Thanks, preach, but um...
I gotta go.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.952
What's with the life jackets?

22:53.953 --> 22:55.373
I signed us up
for that canoe trip.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.995
There are no snakes, are there?

22:56.996 --> 23:00.258
No.
Cottonmouths, maybe, though.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.210
- No.
- Maybe pythons.

23:02.211 --> 23:04.303
- No.
- You guys bravin' the rapids?

23:05.384 --> 23:08.096
Uh, yeah, that's the idea.

23:08.097 --> 23:09.508
Is that fly fishing gear?

23:09.509 --> 23:14.433
Yes, indeed. Uh, you guys wanna
come with, Ill show you the ropes.

23:14.434 --> 23:18.977
Uh... you know, thanks,
for the offer,

23:18.978 --> 23:21.319
I... I think we're gonna
chart our own course.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.022
Okay. No problem.

23:27.577 --> 23:29.868
You clearly wanted to go.

23:29.869 --> 23:32.330
And you clearly didn't,
it's... it's fine.

23:32.331 --> 23:35.835
Well... friends aren't really
my thing.

23:38.958 --> 23:41.340
Most guys would've just done
what they wanted to do.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.424
I guess I'm not...
most guys, then.

23:46.546 --> 23:48.097
No, you're not.

23:52.141 --> 23:53.472
Yo, wait up.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.104
We'll tag along.

23:58.017 --> 23:59.939
- Come on.
- We're coming!

24:07.026 --> 24:09.367
Helen moved to my high school
in grade eleven.

24:09.368 --> 24:12.330
That first day I was like,
"Who is she?"

24:12.331 --> 24:13.572
That's a good one.

24:13.573 --> 24:16.835
But, uh, I did what any
red-blooded 16-year-old would...

24:16.836 --> 24:18.957
He stalked me after school.

24:18.958 --> 24:23.712
I followed her... a little too
close, because I rear-ended her

24:23.713 --> 24:24.793
at a traffic light.

24:24.794 --> 24:26.215
Oh, no!

24:27.587 --> 24:29.388
You two got a meet-cute?

24:30.590 --> 24:35.013
Uh... Well, Charlie
pulled the fire alarm

24:35.014 --> 24:37.055
while I was trying
to take my driving test.

24:37.056 --> 24:39.648
I had to get his attention
somehow, you know?

24:39.649 --> 24:41.100
How long you been married?

24:42.191 --> 24:43.863
- Six months.
- Two years.

24:47.607 --> 24:50.780
You two aren't
really married, are you?

24:53.743 --> 24:55.994
No, we... we met three days ago.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.326
Three days. Wow.

24:58.327 --> 25:01.039
You two must not be able to keep
your hands off each other, eh?

25:01.040 --> 25:05.794
Oh, no, Holden's been nothing
but a perfect gentleman,

25:05.795 --> 25:09.718
but, you know, sometimes a girl just
wants to be ravaged, you know...

25:09.719 --> 25:11.009
Hear, hear.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.222
Okay.

25:14.303 --> 25:16.014
So the two of you came
all the way out to the boonies

25:16.015 --> 25:18.226
to stargaze and not have sex?

25:18.227 --> 25:19.728
Phil.

25:19.729 --> 25:23.022
What? Oh. Sorry.

25:40.329 --> 25:42.000
No, no, no, no!

25:42.001 --> 25:43.332
- What?
- Wait.

25:47.967 --> 25:51.591
What's it gonna be?
The red pill or the blue pill?

25:53.723 --> 25:54.764
Blue pill.

25:56.475 --> 25:58.177
Oh, my god!

25:59.939 --> 26:04.352
Um, maybe I shouldn't ask
you this, and maybe I should,

26:04.353 --> 26:08.107
but if... if you haven't done
this before, it doesn't matter.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.070
No, no, I'm so sorry.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.572
No, it's okay, I just...

26:21.120 --> 26:22.201
Okay.

26:25.374 --> 26:27.085
You good there?

26:27.086 --> 26:30.008
- Smooth, right?
- Yeah.

26:30.009 --> 26:31.130
Whoa.

26:57.156 --> 26:59.287
Did I just...?

26:59.288 --> 27:01.499
Oh, yeah, yep.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.082
I think you did.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.052
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.884
You look terrible.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.556
Uh, gee, thanks.

27:19.218 --> 27:20.850
Hey... talk?

27:23.472 --> 27:30.188
Um... I was drivin' home from work today,
and I got to thinkin' about Holden.

27:30.189 --> 27:32.530
He called. He's havin' fun.

27:32.531 --> 27:35.153
No, no, no, not about
the road trip, it...

27:35.154 --> 27:39.657
You know, it must seem to him
like life is rushing at him like,

27:39.658 --> 27:43.451
- like a speeding train.
- Tom. Growing pains are normal.

27:43.452 --> 27:49.708
Yeah. I know. Uh... there's just some
things that don't square with me.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.251
I want you to hear me out, okay?

27:53.793 --> 27:58.136
There's a cult called Hollow
Sky, and Jeff seems to think...

27:58.137 --> 28:00.930
Jeff? You're talking
to Jeff McArdle?

28:02.141 --> 28:04.392
You're not getting roped into one
of his conspiracy theories...

28:04.393 --> 28:07.226
Listen, I'm... I'm not saying
I believe all of it...

28:08.607 --> 28:10.980
what if he's just
a little bit right?

28:12.571 --> 28:15.363
Listen to me.
Diane, listen to me.

28:15.364 --> 28:18.406
Hollow Sky preys on war vets,
grieving families,

28:18.407 --> 28:21.119
they got their fingers
in all sorts of pies.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.954
Charities... including
"Helping Hands."

28:27.166 --> 28:28.457
Don't.

28:29.879 --> 28:31.629
You've had an ax to grind
with Ian since Day One.

28:31.630 --> 28:34.042
How much did you really know
about Pastor Ian?

28:34.043 --> 28:35.925
Stop this, please!

28:37.596 --> 28:38.967
You're going down
another rabbit hole.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.010
- No, this is different!
- No, it's not!

28:43.642 --> 28:46.054
Tom, we lost you.

28:46.055 --> 28:48.397
I don't even know
what we lost you to.

28:52.061 --> 28:54.022
I know, all right?

28:54.023 --> 28:57.155
I wasn't there for you and Luke.

28:57.156 --> 28:58.818
And I'm sorry for that.

28:59.819 --> 29:00.990
Very sorry.

29:03.202 --> 29:04.363
I'm sorry.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.833
Holden waking up
is a second chance.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.546
For all of us.

29:18.547 --> 29:19.929
I know.

29:22.221 --> 29:26.554
You know what? I'm gonna make some
coffee and... just... stay, and...

29:26.555 --> 29:29.437
No, I'm okay, I'm all right,
I'm good.

29:29.438 --> 29:32.230
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:32.231 --> 29:33.602
I gotta go.

29:35.104 --> 29:36.985
Hey...

29:36.986 --> 29:40.068
Forget about
what I just said, okay?

29:40.069 --> 29:41.069
Just forget about it.

29:44.663 --> 29:47.035
Good night.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.667
Good night.

30:10.689 --> 30:13.191
Hey, Jeff.

30:13.192 --> 30:16.145
I, uh... I need a favor.

30:18.277 --> 30:21.279
I wanna thank you all for
traveling on such short notice.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.033
And for your continued service
to Hollow Sky.

30:25.494 --> 30:28.206
You've proven that you're willing
to do what needs to be done,

30:28.207 --> 30:29.207
no questions asked.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.253
What you witness tomorrow
may beg questions...

30:36.215 --> 30:39.717
questions that I'm not
authorized to answer.

30:39.718 --> 30:44.762
But believe me when I say our
defining moment is near.

30:44.763 --> 30:47.225
This job is not your garden
variety snatch and grab.

30:47.226 --> 30:50.930
Our target is a young man
named Holden Matthews.

30:52.311 --> 30:55.233
A Google search will tell you
he was in a 12-year coma.

30:55.234 --> 30:58.737
It will not tell you
how dangerous he is.

31:00.189 --> 31:03.651
Failing to bring him in puts
our entire cause at risk.

31:03.652 --> 31:06.194
We hit the cabins at daybreak.

31:06.195 --> 31:09.447
Surprise is our only advantage.

31:09.448 --> 31:14.202
With luck, we'll storm the cabins,
shoot Holden pull of tranks,

31:14.203 --> 31:17.086
and have him in a van
before anybody's awake.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.458
Now there is an x factor.

31:20.459 --> 31:22.000
There's a girl with Mr. Matthews.
If you find...

31:22.001 --> 31:24.923
Holden Matthews is the target.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.265
The girl is expendable.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.201
Charlie?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.209
Hey.

32:02.381 --> 32:03.712
What's going on?

32:07.386 --> 32:08.927
I was thinking...

32:10.889 --> 32:14.143
there must be a lot of places
you wanna see.

32:16.015 --> 32:18.107
What if we didn't go back
to Fort Reed?

32:22.481 --> 32:23.482
I'm...

32:24.733 --> 32:29.068
I'm having an amazing...
time with you, Charlie.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.033
Fort Reed is my home.

32:36.665 --> 32:40.168
Smalltown, U.S.A., a guy with
super powers is gonna stick out,

32:40.169 --> 32:44.882
but, in some big city
on the other side of the world,

32:44.883 --> 32:46.215
maybe not so much.

32:51.220 --> 32:55.934
If what I am puts my family
in danger, then...

32:57.016 --> 33:00.229
you know, it's my responsibility
to keep them safe.

33:01.900 --> 33:06.275
I just... need to be prepared
for whatever is coming my way.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.086
Sorry, it's so late.

33:28.087 --> 33:30.178
Meeting ran long as usual.

33:30.179 --> 33:33.131
Clint Drew's congregation
is in all kinds of disarray,

33:33.132 --> 33:34.633
or so he says.

33:37.056 --> 33:38.266
You okay?

33:38.267 --> 33:42.230
Yeah, yeah. I...
I'm just tired.

33:42.231 --> 33:44.642
My brain is fried from work.

33:44.643 --> 33:48.276
Mm. Were you going to invite
me in, or, uh...

33:48.277 --> 33:50.149
are you hiding somebody
in there?

34:12.130 --> 34:14.553
All right.
We're all set up.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.806
The hour of the wolf.

34:19.808 --> 34:20.888
The hour of the what?

34:20.889 --> 34:24.442
The hour before dawn,
hour of the wolf it's called.

34:24.443 --> 34:28.775
More babies are born,
more people die.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.779
When you dream
and when your nightmares

34:31.780 --> 34:33.110
are at their strongest.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.454
My grandpa told me about it
when I was a boy.

34:36.455 --> 34:38.576
He was from the old country.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.498
Brought some of those
old ideas with him.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.121
Back then they didn't fear
the unknown.

34:45.043 --> 34:46.964
They stared into it.

34:46.965 --> 34:49.967
So this kid... he's the wolf.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.761
No, no, no, Holden's
not the wolf.

34:55.634 --> 34:57.426
Oh. You're the wolf.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.018
Nobody is the... the...

35:03.101 --> 35:04.853
The wolf is the wolf.

35:06.145 --> 35:09.066
The... The... The wolf is you.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.279
It represents your worst fears.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.030
It comes knockin' on your door,

35:13.031 --> 35:16.945
and it's like a...
it's like a reckoning, Ramon.

35:19.448 --> 35:20.499
Hm.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.378
Oh!

38:56.084 --> 38:57.215
Aah!

39:06.725 --> 39:08.016
Don't, Holden, don't!

39:30.328 --> 39:31.329
Holden!

40:56.204 --> 40:58.126
Get up! Get up!

41:00.038 --> 41:01.418
Get back!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:01.419 --> 41:03.379
- Oh. Okay, okay.
- Don't think I won't shoot you.

41:56.224 --> 41:59.516
Holden, stay with me. Stay with
me, it's gonna be all right.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.689
Keep your eyes open.
You gotta be awake.

42:01.690 --> 42:04.022
Holden! Holden!
