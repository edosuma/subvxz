opened.

Then someone moved
the cameras remotely,

so we can't see
how she opened the door.

simplest explanation

a thing.

the logical explanation?

that we have all the tools

18:44.688 --> 18:46.560
look, this is...

18:46.603 --> 18:48.257

and I just don't want it

18:48.301 --> 18:49.563
to interfere with your life.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.217

18:52.827 --> 18:54.568

18:54.611 --> 18:57.005
I only have pictures of her.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.833
You know?

18:58.876 --> 19:00.356
And I want to know
what happened.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.315
She doesn't even know.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.186
And until we have
more information,

19:04.230 --> 19:06.188
it's just not safe to see her.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.886

just out, but I guess

19:22.683 --> 19:23.858

19:23.901 --> 19:25.120
So let's just go,
okay?

19:26.426 --> 19:27.862
