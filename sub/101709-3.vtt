00:01.625 --> 00:04.208
[Meredith] <i>Wash your hands.</i>
<i>Wear a mask.</i>

00:04.291 --> 00:06.792
<i>Stay six feet apart </i><i>at all times.</i>

00:06.875 --> 00:08.291
<i>Work from home.</i>

00:08.375 --> 00:10.875
<i>Only leave the house</i>
<i>for essential services.</i>

00:10.959 --> 00:13.458
-[thermometer beeps]
-Thank you, Doctor. All good.

00:15.959 --> 00:16.834
[camera crew] We're ready here.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.500
In three, two...

00:22.583 --> 00:24.375
Good morning, Grey-Sloan.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.333
Richard Webber, here,

00:26.417 --> 00:29.458
...chief medical officer
for the Catherine Fox Foundation.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.333
[Meredith]
<i>And at times, we even need you</i>

00:31.417 --> 00:33.250
<i>to isolate </i><i>from the people you love.</i>

00:33.417 --> 00:35.709
This time has been extremely difficult.

00:36.458 --> 00:40.166
<i>Many members of our staff</i>
<i>have been unable </i><i>to see their families,</i>

00:40.250 --> 00:42.458
<i>we've struggled with supplies,</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:45.041
<i>and we've lost more patients</i>
<i>than we could ever imagine.</i>

00:46.125 --> 00:47.208
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:47.291 --> 00:48.667
[Koracick] I gotta say,
it's a definite improvement

00:48.750 --> 00:50.166
from his last on-screen performance.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.709
Only two people in the lounge
at a time. Covid protocol.

00:52.792 --> 00:53.792
-Since when?
-Since now.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.208
[Richard]
<i>Along with our patients,</i>

00:55.291 --> 00:57.792
<i>we need to take care </i><i>of each other.</i>

00:58.250 --> 01:00.125
<i>That's why </i><i>I'm pleased to announce</i>

01:00.208 --> 01:02.166
<i>that Grey-Sloan </i><i>has been fortunate enough</i>

01:02.250 --> 01:06.250
<i>to secure enough Covid tests</i>
<i>for the entire staff.</i>

01:06.333 --> 01:08.875
<i>Today, we will be testing </i><i>hospital-wide.</i>

01:08.959 --> 01:10.709
<i>It is not an option.</i>

01:11.458 --> 01:14.083
<i>Additionally, </i><i>and effective immediately,</i>

01:14.166 --> 01:16.291
<i>residents will not be able</i>
<i>to go into rooms</i>

01:16.375 --> 01:17.917
<i>with Covid-positive patients</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:20.250
<i>or those patients</i>
<i>whose results are pending.</i>

01:20.333 --> 01:22.667
[Jo] That's half the hospital's
patient intake!

01:22.750 --> 01:24.542
-[Levi] Why?!
-[Richard] <i>It is imperative</i>

01:24.625 --> 01:26.834
<i>that we control the hospital's</i>
<i>transmission rate</i>

01:26.917 --> 01:28.667
and protect our residents.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.667
Oh, and speaking of residents,

01:30.750 --> 01:34.000
please let's give our new class
of interns a warm welcome.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.917
[applause]

01:36.000 --> 01:39.125
And they have graciously agreed
to start early

01:39.208 --> 01:40.750
to help us in our time of need.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.709
[Meredith]
<i>We have to press pause on everything</i>

01:42.792 --> 01:45.208
<i>that makes us feel like we belong.</i>

01:45.500 --> 01:49.458
<i>Sadly, quarantine looks a lot</i>
<i>like surgical internship.</i>

01:49.542 --> 01:51.667
<i>No joy if you want to survive.</i>

01:51.750 --> 01:54.083
Sorry, I went to get a few hours of sleep.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.959
Hey. OK. Present.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.667
[Mabel] Patient was admitted
for respiratory support

01:57.750 --> 02:00.417
four days ago,
after a positive Covid test.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.709
Her O2 is 92% on six liters nasal cannula,

02:03.792 --> 02:05.625
WBC count is downtrending,

02:05.709 --> 02:07.917
and her latest creatinine is .89.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.667
How's she feeling? Any body aches?

02:09.750 --> 02:11.542
Increased fatigue?

02:11.625 --> 02:13.458
[Meredith, muffled]
Why don't you ask me yourself?!

02:15.959 --> 02:16.834
Lungs sound good.

02:18.792 --> 02:19.625
Hey.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.458
[Meredith] When are you gonna
let me out of here?

02:22.542 --> 02:24.083
[Teddy] I'm gonna let you out of here

02:24.166 --> 02:25.917
when I'm convinced
you won't collapse again.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.792
[Meredith] Well, that was
four days ago. I feel fine.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.750
I think you should just release
me with supplemental oxygen

02:31.834 --> 02:33.709
so I can go quarantine in a hotel.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.083
Let's give the room
to someone who really needs it.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.917
According to the tracker,
we're almost at capacity.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.041
I told them to take away
your log-in privileges

02:41.125 --> 02:42.458
so that you would rest.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.083
I have connections. I own the place.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.375
Well, let me take a look
at your inflammatory markers

02:47.458 --> 02:49.375
and your D-dimers, and then we'll talk.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.583
[monitor beeping]

02:51.667 --> 02:53.250
[Meredith] Who's on my service?!

02:53.834 --> 02:55.834
It's handled, Mer! We got it!

02:55.959 --> 02:57.375
And will you stop yelling?

02:57.458 --> 02:58.917
You need to save your breath.

02:59.917 --> 03:01.291
[sighs]

03:01.375 --> 03:02.959
-[flatline]
-[Maggie] Damn it!

03:04.166 --> 03:07.000
[flatline continues]

03:12.333 --> 03:13.917
[flatline continues]

03:16.375 --> 03:18.583
We were not able
to resuscitate Mrs. Lewis...

03:18.667 --> 03:21.000
Respiratory failure. Time of death 8:12.

03:21.417 --> 03:22.458
Do you want me to call her daughter?

03:22.542 --> 03:24.333
No. I've been getting to
know her these past two weeks.

03:24.417 --> 03:25.250
I should call her.

03:25.709 --> 03:26.667
I want to call her.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.959
You OK?

03:32.667 --> 03:34.625
That's the seventh patient
I've lost this week.

03:36.709 --> 03:37.542
I'm sorry.

03:38.792 --> 03:39.625
Me, too.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.125
-Are you lost?
-[chuckling] No.

03:43.208 --> 03:45.208
It's quiet on the peds floor,
so I thought I'd come down here

03:45.291 --> 03:47.083
and see if I could
ease the burden a little bit.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.625
Turns out, adults aren't as funny as kids.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.333
Unless you find death funny.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.375
Sorry, I'm in a really dark mood.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.709
How's Grey doing?

03:55.792 --> 03:58.917
Oh, I hear she's bossing
everybody around up there.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.208
Glad to see some things
are returning to normal.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.250
Want me to tell her you said hi?

04:03.333 --> 04:05.375
God, no. Wouldn't want her
to think she's special.

04:06.583 --> 04:07.959
[telephone rings]

04:08.041 --> 04:10.959
I would get another CRP, ESR, D-dimer,

04:11.041 --> 04:12.583
and I'd like to schedule her
for a chest CT

04:12.667 --> 04:14.458
before we even <i>consider </i>discharging her.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.041
I'm sorry, "I"?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.583
We. You. Whomever.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.625
-What's going on?
-Meredith wants to leave

04:19.709 --> 04:22.750
to go to a hotel.
Her pulse ox is above 92%,

04:22.834 --> 04:26.625
her ABG looks good, no fever for 48 hours.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.166
I'll check her daily labs,

04:28.250 --> 04:30.000
but she does not want any more tests.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.750
And this is protocol.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.041
And she wants us to follow it.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.333
Meredith breaks protocol
for every patient.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.709
We can't break it for her?

04:39.792 --> 04:43.166
Part of being an attending
means no longer asking for permission.

04:47.542 --> 04:48.875
-[DeLuca] Hey!
-[Maggie] Meredith! Oh, my God.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.667
-[DeLuca] Mer? Mer! Hey!
-Meredith?

-Hey!
-Hey, Mer!

04:51.959 --> 04:53.417
-[Maggie] Meredith?
-Hey, OK, OK.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.166
-[Maggie] Meredith?
-OK. Let's turn her over. One, two, three.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.667
-[Maggie] Meredith, come on.
-Stay with me, Mer. Hey.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.583
OK, come on.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.375
-Meredith?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.792

06:51.875 --> 06:54.667
I just was trying
to take a couple of steps.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.333
I thought I could make it.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.917
I want to go to the beach.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.834
The only place you're going is
radiology for a chest CT, Mer.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.583
No more tests.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.291
Meredith, that is where
we are going right now.

[Link] E-Excuse me. ma'am,

07:20.417 --> 07:22.500
despite what you may read
or hear in the news,

07:22.625 --> 07:25.333
sunlight does not in fact kill Covid-19.

07:25.417 --> 07:28.208
Ha. I've been covering Meredith's service.

07:28.291 --> 07:31.125
I haven't been outside in four days.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.083
-What are you doing here?
-Hand trauma.

07:33.166 --> 07:35.542
You left Amelia alone
with four kids for a hand?

07:35.625 --> 07:36.875
She told me to come in.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.500
Oh. You're already annoying her.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.375
What's on your shirt?

07:41.458 --> 07:44.208
Ooh, that's, uh, syrup?

07:44.291 --> 07:45.875
I made pancakes this morning.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.333
Weird. You're a dad.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.667
-Missed you!
-Yeah.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.458
[laughs]

07:51.542 --> 07:53.583
Abdominal pain consult in the ER.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.583
[snaps fingers] I have faith in you.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.417
Covid test is still pending.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.333
I feel like I could just lay down and die.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.083
Ah. [imitates spitting]

08:02.542 --> 08:04.709
You really shouldn't say that
during a pandemic.

08:04.792 --> 08:05.959
God.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.792
[DeLuca] We should have
gotten scans hours ago.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.083
-[Teddy] She felt fine hours ago.
-That's the thing with these patients.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.542
They think that they're
on the other side of this thing,

08:14.625 --> 08:16.041
-and then they tank.
-[Maggie] DeLuca--

08:16.125 --> 08:17.417
Instead of waiting around,
we should have started

08:17.500 --> 08:19.917
interferon alpha 2b, anti-retrovirals,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.500
antimalarial drugs.

08:21.583 --> 08:24.333
I got a-a dozen patients
in the ICU already on this protocol.

08:24.417 --> 08:25.834
And you're seeing positive results?

08:25.917 --> 08:27.583
With some, but I've also
read a lot of studies

08:27.667 --> 08:29.208
that show that these meds,
they reduce the sev--

08:29.291 --> 08:30.625
-[Teddy] What studies?
-Are these peer-reviewed?

08:30.709 --> 08:32.125
-[Teddy] Have they been published?
-They're credible.

08:32.208 --> 08:35.041
Nothing is credible. Not yet.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.583
And I don't feel comfortable

08:36.667 --> 08:38.417
giving Meredith Grey
some experimental drug

08:38.500 --> 08:40.709
that's gotten some foot traffic
on a Reddit board.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.000
Let's just get the scans first.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.667
We can fight about the plan later.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.250
[groans]

08:49.333 --> 08:50.709
Val Ashton?

08:50.792 --> 08:53.458
Hi. I'm Dr. Wilson.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.041
OK, so you've had
abdominal pain and vomiting

08:56.125 --> 08:58.333
-for the last two weeks?
-But it's not Covid.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.917
I have gone nowhere,
seen no one, touched nothing.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.375
I couldn't stop talking
to the nurse that took my blood.

09:04.458 --> 09:06.083
It was the first in-person conversation

09:06.166 --> 09:07.667
I had had in months.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.166
I told her about the fight
with my co-worker,

09:10.250 --> 09:11.500
all about my ex.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.041
And I think I invited her to lunch.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.041
[chuckling] Don't worry.
They're used to it. Mnh.

09:16.834 --> 09:20.500
OK, so your labs came back
already, and...

09:20.583 --> 09:22.000
congratulations.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.625
You don't have Covid.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.083
You're just pregnant.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.667
-What?
-Pregnant.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.291
-What?
-Yaay?

09:33.208 --> 09:34.166
[Jackson] Sorry they even called you in.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.625
I know you're technically on leave,

09:35.709 --> 09:37.542
-so if you need to--
-[Link] Happy to help!

09:37.625 --> 09:39.333
-What do we got?
-Ssssh.

09:40.875 --> 09:44.208
Bryan, Lucy needs time...

09:44.291 --> 09:47.583
and she needs patience. Try again.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.667
Any chance you can come back
in 15 minutes?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.750
My clients are about
to have a major breakthrough.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.667
No, sorry.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.333

09:55.417 --> 09:58.041
Manoj Joshi, closed crush
injury to the right hand

09:58.125 --> 09:59.667
due to a sandblaster falling on it.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.417
He presents with pain,
swelling, and numbness.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.792
X-rays didn't show any fractures.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.125
But he does have delayed capillary refill.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.500
My therapy practice
has boomed with the pandemic,

10:08.583 --> 10:10.166
so I finally could afford
to make some improvements

10:10.250 --> 10:12.083
to my home office.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.333
[strained] I guess I should
have let a professional do it.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.041
[groaning]

10:17.625 --> 10:20.166
How long is my hand
gonna be out of commission?

10:20.250 --> 10:23.041
I do a lot of demonstration in my work.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.000
-As a... therapist?
-[Lucy moans]

10:25.166 --> 10:26.917
[Bryan]
<i>Do I do it counter-clockwise now, Dr. J?</i>

10:27.083 --> 10:28.333
-[moaning]
<i>-I think she likes it.</i>

10:28.417 --> 10:30.417
-[Jackson] Oh!
-[Manoj] Sex therapist.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.959
[Taryn] Mute, mute, mute.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.125
[moaning stops]

10:34.625 --> 10:36.709
-You think it's a joke.
-Absolutely not.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.542
Physical touch and pleasure

10:38.625 --> 10:41.792
are two of the most important
forms of communication.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.709
What I teach is more vital than ever

10:43.792 --> 10:44.834
in the middle of a global crisis

10:44.917 --> 10:46.625
that's destroying human connection.

10:46.709 --> 10:47.959
I need my hand to function.

10:48.041 --> 10:51.208
Well, we just need a CT
to determine if you need surgery.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.500
Fine.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.083
Can I have the room now?

10:56.291 --> 10:57.417
-Yep.
-[Jackson] Yep.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.125
-[Lucy moaning]
-All right, Bryan.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.208
See, Lucy likes that.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.542
[Owen] Drive-thru testing should be up
and running by tomorrow morning.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.375
-Thank you for that, Webber.
-Sure.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.333
I asked Koracick about that for weeks.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.750
[Bailey] Uh, speaking of inefficiencies,

11:13.834 --> 11:15.333
I have a whole list of things

11:15.417 --> 11:17.417
Tom Koracick did that I'd like to change.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.583
How about putting it in writing, you know?

11:19.667 --> 11:20.875
E-mail me.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.709
Uh, since when do you prefer e-mail?

11:23.959 --> 11:25.542
Ah. Times have changed

11:25.625 --> 11:27.250
since the last time I was chief, Bailey.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.083
-You got to keep up.
-Of chiefs. Chief <i>of </i>chiefs.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.583
-I'm still chief.
-And I'm still yours.

11:32.667 --> 11:36.000
Well, now that you have his job,
what happens to Tom Koracick?

11:36.959 --> 11:39.125
Don't worry about him. [grunts]

11:39.208 --> 11:40.875
I have a plan.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.417
I am Dr. Thomas Koracick,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.709
but you can call me Dr. Koracick.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.333
Maybe you were expecting Dr. Webber,

11:50.417 --> 11:52.166
but today is a day of many surprises.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.417
The first of which,
I have drawn a very short straw.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.000
The second,
you have won the lottery today.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.625
I'd spend some time regaling you
with my accomplishments,

11:59.709 --> 12:01.041
but I'm very busy.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.583
Treat yourself to an Internet search.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.750
-Which one are you?
-Reza Khan.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.583
You're on scut.

12:06.667 --> 12:07.959
Respectfully, I can handle more.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.625
I'm a vascular surgeon in Pakistan.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.583
The U.S. is just making me
repeat my training.

12:11.709 --> 12:13.667
Ah, unfortunate. But you're still on scut.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.959
Chee? Progress notes.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.834
Jensen, discharges.

12:17.917 --> 12:21.917
Ortiz, a new shipment of PPE
and testing supplies arrives today.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.458
You get to sort them. Riveting.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.458
Excuse me? Which Ortiz?

12:25.542 --> 12:28.458
-I'm Sara Ortiz.
-And I'm Alma Ortiz, her mother.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.000
-We both matched here.
-Ah, how sweet.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.750
But two interns
with the same name won't fly.

12:32.834 --> 12:33.792
Who's changing theirs?

12:34.542 --> 12:37.959
All right, we'll go with nicknames.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.208
Big O, Little O?

12:40.291 --> 12:41.458
You decide.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.542
Name tags for everyone.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.125
If you need anything at all,

12:48.208 --> 12:49.125
ask someone else.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.458
[scoffs]

12:53.291 --> 12:54.667
[monitor beeping]

12:54.750 --> 12:57.458
[Meredith] Ground-glass
opacities of the lungs.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.083
Someone sent me an article

12:59.166 --> 13:02.667
about triple antiviral therapy
for Covid patients.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.208
The side effects are kind of tricky,

13:04.500 --> 13:05.834
but I think I could handle it.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.500
You're supposed to be resting.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.625
I specifically asked them
not to give you a tablet.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.875
[Meredith] Here, I found it.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.667
Triple antiviral therapy.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.333
Phase two trial of combination
antiviral therapy

13:17.667 --> 13:20.041
could speed recovery in Covid patients.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.166
What do you think?

13:22.166 --> 13:23.458
I'll ask Altman.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.583
[Maggie] Are you good?

13:32.667 --> 13:34.125
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you mean.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.291
I mean are you good?
Because I've respected the boundaries

13:36.375 --> 13:37.625
for the last four days.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.291
I've played the role of family member.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.250
I have respected your authority
as a physician.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.959
-Maggie, I've got this.
-Do you?

13:44.041 --> 13:45.583
Because we both know what happens

13:45.667 --> 13:48.333
when a patient's lungs
start to look like that.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.750
They could turn on us at any moment.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.166
So I need you to swear

13:56.250 --> 13:58.709
that no matter what is going on
in your personal life,

13:58.792 --> 14:00.083
you have this.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.375
[crying] Because I can't be her doctor.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.125
I have to be her sister.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.709
I have this.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.458
I'd like DeLuca to be on her medical team.

14:12.542 --> 14:15.041
He's seen more Covid cases than any of us.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.125
OK.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.709
My husband and I
tried to get pregnant for years.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.750
Six rounds of IVF.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.125
And we ended up with no baby, no savings,

14:35.208 --> 14:36.792
and we hated each other.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.291
So we split up.

14:38.375 --> 14:42.083
And then I had a one-night stand
with this weirdo, Newman,

14:42.333 --> 14:44.875
who was renting our back house
for a couple of weeks.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.166
I had lost my job, had some wine,

14:47.375 --> 14:50.083
-then I switched to tequila.
-[Jo laughs]

14:50.166 --> 14:51.375
Ugh!

14:51.458 --> 14:54.333
My rock bottom is the father of my baby.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.250
[Carina] He's not.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.625
-What?
-I see no baby.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.125
I'm not pregnant?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.750
I'm sorry, but no.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.041
[gasps]

15:04.542 --> 15:06.500
A positive pregnancy test
with no pregnancy

15:06.583 --> 15:08.333
can indicate other things.

15:08.458 --> 15:09.750
I'll order a scan.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.375
Other things like what?

15:11.458 --> 15:15.000
Some tumors, uh, can release beta HCG.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.709
-A tumor?
-We will take it one step at a time.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.166
[crying]

15:24.542 --> 15:25.875
[Link] I saw the scans.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.792
Displaced fracture
of the hook of the hamate?

15:27.875 --> 15:29.417
[Jackson] Exactly.
You know, the ulnar artery

15:29.500 --> 15:31.041
looks a little narrow
by the fracture site,

15:31.125 --> 15:32.709
which I've seen in plenty of patients

15:32.792 --> 15:35.208
that use a lot of vibrating power tools.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.875
You don't say.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.625
Yeah. You gonna be able
to help me with the excision

15:38.709 --> 15:40.709
-or you got to get back?
-Oh, I'm staying.

15:40.792 --> 15:44.250
Four kids in lockdown.
This place is like a dream vacation.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.917
Got to say I think I'm a little jealous.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.166
I don't get to see my Harriet
as much as I used to

15:49.250 --> 15:51.166
'cause I take more Covid shifts
than my ex,

15:51.250 --> 15:52.750
so she's with her stepdad more than me,

15:52.834 --> 15:54.208
which, you know, he's a good guy,

15:54.458 --> 15:55.750
but I don't like hearing

15:55.834 --> 15:58.291
that Matthew cuts sandwiches
better than Dada.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.792
Kinda weird having my place so quiet.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.417
I kinda miss the mess, honestly.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.917
[Taryn] Apparently he's famous
in the Pacific Northwest.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.333
He saves marriages.

16:05.458 --> 16:06.875
You're Googling our patient, Helm, really?

16:06.959 --> 16:08.583
Whoa, 37 an hour.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.625
Thirty-seven... dollars? Like his rate?

16:13.083 --> 16:14.458
-No.
-Not possible.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.083
Good to have goals.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.083
[Karen] You're doing it wrong.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.792
No, you're doing it wrong again.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.458
Hey, are you in charge of him?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.417
[Koracick] Well, depends.
Has he killed anyone, or--

16:26.500 --> 16:27.959
I've been waiting for the progress notes

16:28.041 --> 16:31.208
and summaries for two hours,
and he hasn't even finished one.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.625
Fix it.

16:32.709 --> 16:36.041
You clearly don't know
how to make friends.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.125
Scoot.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.750
[telephone ringing in distance]

16:39.834 --> 16:42.000
[indistinct conversations in distance]

16:44.792 --> 16:46.834
Well, here's your problem,
next to "Discharged."

16:46.917 --> 16:48.750
I-I-I type "Home and awaiting follow-up."

16:48.834 --> 16:50.500
And I keep getting "Error."

16:50.583 --> 16:51.917
That's because they're not
being discharged to go <i>home.</i>

16:52.000 --> 16:53.583
They're being discharged to the morgue

16:53.667 --> 16:55.959
or to the giant Popsicle truck
in the south parking lot,

16:56.041 --> 16:57.625
which is very sad.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.583
All these people have died?

17:00.667 --> 17:02.834
You're doing death summaries
during a global pandemic,

17:02.917 --> 17:04.792
so... yes.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.250
All dead.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.166
Carry on.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.041
[Bailey] Wilson, I need you to
keep covering Grey's service.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.834
I'm hoping to persuade Dr. Webber

17:17.917 --> 17:19.709
to come back to the OR,

17:19.792 --> 17:22.333
whenever he finishes adjusting his crown.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.583
Chief of chiefs.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.250
I could be chief of chiefs.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.625
You'd be really good at that.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.500
Hmm. What do you got?

17:28.583 --> 17:32.834
[Jo] Abdominal pain, vomiting,
positive beta HCG.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.834
She's not pregnant,
but I want to rule out a mass.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.458
[Levi] Mass! There. In the liver.

17:36.542 --> 17:40.000
That is no mass. That is a fetus.

17:40.083 --> 17:43.750
She is pregnant, but her baby
is attached to her <i>liver?</i>

17:43.834 --> 17:45.250
[gasps] Mine.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.917
Uh, th-this patient doesn't have Covid.

17:47.000 --> 17:47.875
I'm allowed to be on the case.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.917
[sighs]

17:52.375 --> 17:54.125
[Bailey] I feel better.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.542
[Amelia] <i>Go wash up, Ellis.</i>

18:00.375 --> 18:03.000
Shh, Amelia,
you'll increase her heart rate.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.041
What's happening?

18:04.125 --> 18:06.625
<i>-We were watching you sleep.</i>
-Why?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.375
Well, we didn't want to wake you.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.917
How are you feeling?
Like I want to go back to sleep.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.291
How are my kids?
Did Bailey lose that tooth yet?

18:13.375 --> 18:14.667
<i>They miss you.</i>

18:14.750 --> 18:17.041
<i>Bailey's tooth is stubbornly </i><i>still there.</i>

18:17.125 --> 18:19.500
[Maggie]
So, Meredith, I was looking at your chart,

18:19.583 --> 18:23.458
and I noticed your healthcare directive.

18:23.542 --> 18:25.500
-It says--
-I know what it says.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
OK. Good. Um, so,

18:28.750 --> 18:30.750
well, we were thinking that maybe

18:30.834 --> 18:32.333
you might want to reconsider.

18:32.417 --> 18:33.667
[Ellis] <i>Mama?</i>

18:33.750 --> 18:36.333
<i>Is that Mama? </i><i>Is she OK?</i>

18:36.583 --> 18:38.542
<i>Hold on, Ellis.</i>
<i>I-I will let you talk to her</i>

18:38.625 --> 18:39.959
<i>in one minute, OK?</i>

18:40.125 --> 18:41.917
-Put her on, Amelia.
<i>-Of course, I--</i>

18:42.166 --> 18:44.208
<i>But can we talk about w-what</i>
<i>happens if you suddenly--</i>

18:44.291 --> 18:46.500
I don't want to talk about that.
I want to talk to my kids.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.375
<i>-Mama!</i>
<i>-Hey.</i>

18:49.458 --> 18:51.291
<i>Look at you, so big.</i>

18:51.500 --> 18:54.000
Auntie Amelia is feeding you
all that growing-food, huh?

18:54.083 --> 18:57.750
[Ellis laughs]

18:57.834 --> 19:00.291
I love you so much, Ellie bell.

19:05.417 --> 19:08.291
[waves crashing]

19:32.583 --> 19:33.500
Derek!

19:41.834 --> 19:43.583
Why can't I get anywhere?!

19:43.667 --> 19:45.458
[Derek] You're worried about the kids!

19:45.542 --> 19:46.917
[Meredith] I don't understand!

19:47.000 --> 19:50.208
The sand isn't real, Meredith!

19:51.583 --> 19:53.291
I miss you!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.333
I know.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.000
[siren wailing in distance]

20:11.083 --> 20:13.709
[Teddy] Hey. Things seem to be
running smoothly down here.

20:13.792 --> 20:14.959
[Owen] Webber.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.542
Right.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.500
I talked to the kids this morning.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.792
They seem good. Spoiled.

20:20.875 --> 20:21.750
How's Meredith?

20:22.709 --> 20:24.417
Her numbers aren't where they should be.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.125
I got to drop these off.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.291
-[Owen] Ortiz?
-[Sara] I'm sorry.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.834
For what?

20:30.917 --> 20:33.041
-I don't know.
-Your PPE's on incorrectly.

20:33.125 --> 20:33.959
Your gown is loose in the back,

20:34.041 --> 20:36.083
and you just touched the inside
of it with your gloved hand.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.917
And your face shield is not in place.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.250
Tseng, show her how to correctly
don and doff PPE,

20:40.500 --> 20:42.166
which someone should have shown
her first thing this morning.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.458
-But I'm next in line, so c--
-Now.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.333
[Val] There's a baby in my liver?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.458
[Jo] You have what's called
an abdominal pregnancy,

20:54.542 --> 20:57.834
where the fetus develops
outside of the uterus.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.834
You're about 26 weeks.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.208
[Carina] Val, these pregnancies

21:02.291 --> 21:04.000
don't normally survive to term,

21:04.083 --> 21:07.583
but your baby is very much alive.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.208
Your case is extremely rare.

21:11.291 --> 21:15.709
He made me feel like crap for eight years.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.041
Every time IVF didn't work...

21:20.542 --> 21:22.333
[scoffs] he would
look at the doctor and say,

21:22.417 --> 21:24.333
"Well, what can she do
differently next time?"

21:25.333 --> 21:27.583
When clearly it was his fault.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.333
Because I had a one-night stand

21:29.417 --> 21:31.375
with a guy that wears
square computer glasses,

21:31.458 --> 21:33.125
and I'm knocked up.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.417
[Carina] Val.

21:36.166 --> 21:39.083
[monitor beeping]

21:41.792 --> 21:43.500
Do you want this baby?

21:46.125 --> 21:47.834
[inhales tearfully]

21:47.917 --> 21:48.917
[chuckles] [Jo] OK.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.041
OK. Then we need to deliver her today.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.041
The growth of the placenta

21:53.125 --> 21:55.041
could cause the liver to bleed
at any moment,

21:55.125 --> 21:58.458
and we need to operate
to save you both... now.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.041
[chuckling] It's a girl?

22:00.125 --> 22:01.750
Yes, it is.

22:03.667 --> 22:04.500
Luna.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.792
That's her name.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.875
Ever since I was a little girl,
I knew my daughter's name.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.166
Val.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.500
Yeah, OK.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.333
Let's get her out!

22:23.166 --> 22:26.166
[woman, over PA] <i>Dr. Sung to Recovery.</i>

22:26.250 --> 22:27.917

[monitor beeping]

22:29.917 --> 22:32.375
[indistinct conversations in distance]

22:34.875 --> 22:37.750
If you think I look bad,
you should see my lungs.

22:37.834 --> 22:38.709
Not funny.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.625
We need to talk about your POA.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.125
My sisters sent you in here.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.583
I know what Alex Karev means to you.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.667
And I know he would have
your best interests at heart.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.166
But he is halfway across the country,

22:55.250 --> 22:56.750
and we can't even travel yet.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.166
Look, God forbid,
this thing gets any worse,

23:01.250 --> 23:05.166
he might have to make decisions
regarding your care.

23:05.250 --> 23:10.542
And you know those decisions
can be rough over the phone.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.625
You need to pick someone local.

23:12.750 --> 23:15.625
Amelia can't even decide
what's for dinner.

23:18.041 --> 23:21.125
Maggie-- She doesn't know when
it's time for someone to die.

23:21.208 --> 23:24.291
She has a hard time letting them go, so...

23:26.000 --> 23:30.583
At least Alex will pull the plug
if I need him to.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.166
[coughs] Let's just talk

23:35.250 --> 23:37.625
about s-something else, please.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.625
I'm about to scrub in
on a hepatic pregnancy

23:42.709 --> 23:47.333
where the fetus is attached to the liver.

23:47.417 --> 23:49.500
No! Alive?

23:51.041 --> 23:53.875
Ugh. I'm so jealous.

23:53.959 --> 23:55.000
[sighs]

24:02.875 --> 24:04.625
[Link] Removing the bone. Rongeur.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.041
[Taryn] Careful around the ulnar nerve.

24:06.125 --> 24:06.959
[Jackson] You want to take over, Helm?

24:07.041 --> 24:10.250
Dr. J's right. People need sex right now.

24:10.333 --> 24:12.041
[chuckles dryly] More than ever.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.667
It's therapeutic.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.125
What if you live in a house

24:16.208 --> 24:18.291
that's like Los Angeles
International Airport

24:18.375 --> 24:19.875
on Thanksgiving Day?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.166
Your flight is delayed,
and there's no place to sit.

24:22.333 --> 24:24.166
The bathrooms are disgusting.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.125
Forget regular sex.
You don't even want to eat.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.166
[Jackson]
Looks like this artery's thrombosed.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.041
-[Link] Can you fix it?
-I've got to harvest a vein

24:31.125 --> 24:32.250
and place a graft.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.667
Take a little bit longer, but, yeah.

24:34.750 --> 24:35.583
I'm in.

24:36.250 --> 24:39.417
I fear the night at Meredith's house
like a medieval villager.

24:39.542 --> 24:40.583

24:40.667 --> 24:41.709
Vessel loops.

[telephone ringing in distance]

24:46.667 --> 24:48.417
[Koracick] "Mama Ortiz"?

24:50.041 --> 24:51.667
[Mama Ortiz] Better than
the one you suggested.

24:51.750 --> 24:55.166
Uh, fine. Can you tell me
why you're not, uh, in the ER?

24:55.250 --> 24:56.959
Jensen is on Discharges.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.166
Yeah, Jensen quit after two hours,
and so did Stewart.

25:00.625 --> 25:04.625
OK, well, why hasn't Mrs., uh, Cooley
been discharged?

25:04.709 --> 25:06.750
I decided not to discharge her.

25:06.959 --> 25:08.166
Her chart is a mess.

25:08.250 --> 25:11.041
Hand-off communication
has been nonexistent.

25:11.125 --> 25:14.250
She's supposed to be discharged
to Hillridge Nursing Facility?

25:14.333 --> 25:15.583
-You ever heard of it?
-I--

25:15.667 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, 17 new Covid cases, 19 deaths.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.750
OK, the-these are all things
that can be discussed

25:20.834 --> 25:21.875
with her doctor.

25:21.959 --> 25:23.208
Great. I would love that.

25:23.291 --> 25:24.417
Where is Dr. Grey?

25:24.500 --> 25:26.667
[Koracick] Look, Dr. Grey is--

25:26.917 --> 25:28.000
She's off today.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.208
Look, your diligence has been noted,

25:29.291 --> 25:30.959
but these are extraordinary times.

25:31.041 --> 25:32.917
Let's not forget that we're
in the middle of a pandemic.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.166
I haven't forgotten.

25:34.917 --> 25:37.959
Before med school,
I spent 20 years as a social worker.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.542
I was there through H1N1.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.875
And I know that people deserve better.

25:41.959 --> 25:43.542
Especially in a pandemic.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.917
So I'm not discharging her.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.583
Have Dr. Grey call me.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.083
Someone's messing with me, right?

25:51.166 --> 25:53.875
We got a 26-weeker attached
to the liver? Still viable?

25:53.959 --> 25:57.041
Come see for yourself. Liver's exposed.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.125
[Carina] Wow.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.500
Hello there, little one.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.375
OK, let's go through it again.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.792
The placenta has left the liver
extremely friable.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.959
We cut. We get the baby out.
We leave the placenta intact.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.041
-Otherwise, she could bleed out.
-[Bailey] Which she will not.

26:10.250 --> 26:13.333
Everyone in this room needs a little joy.

26:13.417 --> 26:14.583
[suction gurgling]

26:14.667 --> 26:15.959
-Ready?
-Ready.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.458
Weirdest C-section I've ever done.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.500
-Also ready.
-[Bailey] Here we go.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.417
[Carina] Cutting into the amniotic sac.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.125
[Jo] Clamps for the umbilical cord.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.250
[Bailey] Heavy scissors.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.208
Thanks.

26:38.208 --> 26:40.083
[Carina]
I'm not seeing any movement.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.542
[Hayes] Prepare to intubate immediately.

26:48.709 --> 26:50.500
Where is all this blood coming from?

26:50.583 --> 26:52.625
Oh, the right hepatic artery.

26:52.709 --> 26:53.667
More suction.

26:53.750 --> 26:54.875
How's Luna?

26:54.959 --> 26:56.291
[monitor beeping rapidly]

26:56.375 --> 26:58.542
Apgar 2, maybe 3.

26:58.625 --> 27:01.041
[Hayes] Still trying to get the tube in.
Come on.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.625
Come on, come on, come--

27:02.709 --> 27:03.667
I'm in.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.208
Bag her, please.

27:09.083 --> 27:11.000
OK, we need to get her up to
the unit as fast as possible.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.041
Go.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.417
Ready, let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.959
[Bailey] More lap pads, more.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.291
More, more--

27:23.375 --> 27:24.750
We should resect the right lobe.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.625
No, that could lead to liver failure. No.

27:27.709 --> 27:30.250
Then we put her on dialysis
and get her on the transplant list.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.417
That's not as easy
as it used to be. Hold on.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.250
I'm not gonna let her die
before she sees her kid.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.709
Clamp.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.333
Hold on! Hold on!

27:41.792 --> 27:42.792
Bailey?

27:44.041 --> 27:45.709
OK. OK, do it.

27:45.792 --> 27:46.959

So, I hear you're looking for a POA.

28:21.709 --> 28:23.250
<i>Are you here to volunteer?</i>

28:23.333 --> 28:25.125
I am cold, calculating,

<i>about you or your kids, so...</i>

28:28.041 --> 28:30.750
<i>Everyone is family.</i>
<i>I don't want to do that </i><i>to them.</i>

28:30.834 --> 28:32.333

28:34.125 --> 28:35.750
<i>and then choose </i><i>someone who'll defend it.</i>

28:35.834 --> 28:37.709
The people who love you
the most, you know,

28:37.792 --> 28:39.959
they're going to beg them to do something,
anything to save you.

28:40.041 --> 28:43.291
So choose someone who'll choose you,

28:43.375 --> 28:44.792
over and over again.

28:44.875 --> 28:46.542
Is that what you did for your wife?

28:46.625 --> 28:48.583
<i>Uh, no-- </i><i>knew better than that.</i>

28:49.083 --> 28:51.917
But her sister followed every
last wish that Abi wanted,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.959
no matter how much we all hated it.

28:55.709 --> 28:56.750
<i>Go on, get some rest.</i>

28:58.083 --> 28:59.000
I'm afraid...

29:01.709 --> 29:03.041
If I fall asleep...

29:06.125 --> 29:08.000
I'm afraid I might not wake up.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.625
<i>Everyone's scared of you, Grey.</i>
<i>You know that?</i>

29:15.667 --> 29:16.917
It's 'cause you're fierce.

29:18.083 --> 29:19.709
You've got teeth, grit.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.333
<i>You fight </i><i>to the bloody death</i>

29:21.417 --> 29:23.041

This virus has got nothing on you.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.000
[video call ends]

29:47.500 --> 29:49.542
[Link] We successfully removed
the bone fragment

29:49.625 --> 29:51.583
and removed a blood clot from your artery.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.709
[Jackson] And fortunately,
the nerve was intact.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.333
You're not gonna get
your feeling back immediately,

29:55.417 --> 29:57.291
but we're confident you will
over the next few months.

29:57.375 --> 30:01.041
And you still have your hand. <i>The </i>hand.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.625
We'll get you an occupational therapist,

30:02.709 --> 30:04.875
go through some exercises
to help you in your recovery.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.417
[Manoj] I have my own regimen.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.917
I exercise my hands five hours a week.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.291
[Jackson] Maybe you could just
take your time

30:12.375 --> 30:15.834
with whatever your... regular routine is.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.750
You want to know my secret, don't you?

30:17.834 --> 30:19.333
-Nah, I think we're good.
-Nah, no thanks.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.208
[Taryn] Yes. I do, please,
tha-thank you, mm-hmm.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.166
I ask my clients what they want.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.000
And I listen.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.000
[knock on door]

30:40.917 --> 30:42.250
[Koracick] Your plan worked.

30:43.083 --> 30:44.750
-Excuse me?
-Well, you had to know

30:44.834 --> 30:46.250
I'm not the man for this job.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.834
Those kids are terrified.

30:47.917 --> 30:49.500
At least the ones
who haven't already quit.

30:49.583 --> 30:51.083
And the ones who stayed
have no idea what they're doing

30:51.166 --> 30:52.583
and I have no idea how to show them.

30:52.834 --> 30:54.125
Or you just don't want to.

30:54.208 --> 30:55.458
