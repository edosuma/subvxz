WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:03.253
(applause)

00:09.676 --> 00:11.261
Hey, that sounded great.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.179
Always does.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.099
Any word?

00:16.181 --> 00:17.434
Uh, no, no, not yet.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.435
But it looks good.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.936
Well, we're gonna play
the song you wrote next.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.104
That should seal the deal.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.273
Um, I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.442
I think it is.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.445
Well, we're trying
to impress Noah here,

00:28.528 --> 00:30.280
{\an3}and I don't know, he's
kind of an up-tempo guy.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.406
You know, I-I don't know if
a love song would be right.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.450
Whatever.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.617
I'll, uh, tell the boys.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.453
Thanks.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.830
I didn't know
it was a love song.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.290
Didn't I mention that?

00:40.373 --> 00:41.416
No, you didn't.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.084
(chuckles):
Oh.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.337
{\an3}So, anybody I know
provide the inspiration?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.881
{\an3}Huh?

00:47.964 --> 00:48.965
{\an3}(chuckles)

00:50.425 --> 00:51.885
Keep the change.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.511
All right.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.389
{\an1}(sighs)

00:56.473 --> 00:58.433
{\an1}Look, man, know you don't
want to hear it...

00:58.516 --> 00:59.809
Then don't say it.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.395
Maybe you should
let her go, man.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.397
Hey.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.359
Not helping yourself out here,
you know?

01:08.443 --> 01:10.361
I think maybe I'll go call
the ex Mrs. Walsh,

01:10.445 --> 01:12.947
{\an3}if that's all
right with you.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.324
Is that okay with you?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.367
Yeah, yeah.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.958
Oh, hi-yo, Silver.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.376
Hey.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.503
Looking for a hit?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.046
{\an3}Uh, no.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.882
{\an3}I left my wallet
in my car.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.177
You know you got
a big audition.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.178
You don't want
to mess it up.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.971
Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.682
I'm serious.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.019
That's your problem.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.062
(chuckles)

01:44.145 --> 01:45.313
(engine starts)

01:45.396 --> 01:46.397
Where you going?

01:50.443 --> 01:51.611
Mark, where you going?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.656
(tires screech)

01:54.739 --> 01:56.449
What about the audition?

02:03.581 --> 02:05.708
(knocking)

02:08.127 --> 02:09.211
Hi.
Hi.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.213
{\an3}Oh, those are
beautiful.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.297
{\an3}Thank you.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.383
Somehow dinner and a movie
didn't seem quite enough.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.384
I'll put them
in some water.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
{\an3}Come on in.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.766
{\an3}You have a
great place.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.767
Oh, thanks.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.935
It's not mine.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.104
I mean, well, it was mine,

02:26.187 --> 02:28.231
{\an1}then I moved out and...
it's a long story.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.399
(phone ringing)

02:29.482 --> 02:30.859
DONNA:
Hey, we're not home right now,

02:30.942 --> 02:32.569
so leave a message
at the beep.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.903
Thanks.
(beep)

02:33.987 --> 02:35.196
BRANDON:
Kel, it's me.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.739
Um,

02:36.823 --> 02:38.741
I haven't heard from you
for a couple days,

02:38.825 --> 02:42.829
so... guess I was just
calling to say hello.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.083
Take care.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.670
(beep)

02:51.838 --> 02:54.090
I told you it was a long story.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.258
(chuckles)

02:55.341 --> 02:56.926
You don't have to explain.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.969
Everybody's got a past.

02:58.052 --> 03:01.222
What do you think?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.391
Absolutely beautiful.

{\an5}DAVID:
<i>He said he heard enough</i>
<i>to decide.</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:05.763
Well, you know what?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.057
{\an3}They only played two songs
before Mark took off.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.517
Well, you know,
that's two more songs

05:09.600 --> 05:10.393
than a friend needs to hear.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.394
Look, Noah's tried

05:11.477 --> 05:12.437
reaching out before.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.563
You haven't been
exactly receptive.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.398
Oh, there you go, Val.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.399
Just take his side.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.400
(sighs)

05:17.483 --> 05:20.111
(phone ringing)

05:20.194 --> 05:21.112
Hello.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.030
(blender whirring)

05:22.113 --> 05:23.740
Hold-hold on a second.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.575
Sorry.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.582
Have I mentioned
what this paper needs?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.792
{\an3}Yeah, if it's the same
thing you've been asking me

05:34.876 --> 05:36.419
{\an3}since yesterday morning,
the answer's still no.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.421
I'm asking for
a restaurant review.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.424
Free food, free wine,
validated parking.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.051
What's the problem?

05:43.134 --> 05:46.429
The problem is is that I've been
working for your ex-witch.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.389
Swear if I clean
one more toilet...

05:48.473 --> 05:51.601
Any updates on
the young doctor in love?

05:51.684 --> 05:53.019
You really want one?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.313
No.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.272
{\an1}(sighs)

05:56.355 --> 06:01.110
{\an3}Well, Mark got in a car
accident last night.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.403
How bad?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.279
{\an3}He's fine.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.655
{\an3}And lucky as
hell he didn't

06:04.739 --> 06:05.656
hurt anybody else.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.949
{\an3}But now Jasper
says that

06:07.033 --> 06:08.659
they may have to put
everything on hold.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.119
I'm really sorry.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.621
{\an6}DAVID:
This is just
my luck.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.582
{\an3}I knew this was too
good to be true.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.136
This is so exciting, seeing
all my designs come to life.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.305
Child's Play is a very important
product line for us.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.099
We're sparing no expense
to promote it.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.434
I have some
preliminary shots here.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.977
The little girl just glows.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.312
{\an3}SASHA:
Get away from me!

06:36.395 --> 06:39.440
Uh, she's been good all morning,

06:39.524 --> 06:41.442
but I have heard
she has a reputation.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.777
Yeah, for selling clothes.

06:42.860 --> 06:46.280
Donna, this has to go well.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.490
Right. It will.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.658
Um, I'll take care of it.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.326
Excuse me.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.203
(hammering)

06:52.286 --> 06:53.496
Hi. Is there a problem?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.998
Mom said we were going to the
circus after we got done today.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.000
{\an6}She promised!
KIM:
I know, sweetie,

06:58.084 --> 06:59.377
{\an1}but that's before
the movie people called.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.337
I don't want to be in a movie.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.172
This is a big audition for us,
and we're doing it.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.173
Is that understood?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.800
Yes.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.051
That's my baby.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.597
{\an1}Now, is there anything
Mommy can get you?

07:12.765 --> 07:14.725
Donna's bracelets?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.352
I don't think so.

07:16.435 --> 07:17.562
I want them.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.150
{\an1}Listen, I think they need you
over there, honey.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.234
Why don't you go?

07:25.319 --> 07:28.489
I know it's a bit odd,
but I'll buy you some more.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.158
It's not about the bracelets.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.701
I don't think giving her
everything she wants

07:31.784 --> 07:32.702
is such a good idea.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.787
Do you want another tantrum?
No.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.247
Well, then give me
the damn bracelets.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.374
I'm sorry.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.001
No.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.384
(sighs)

07:48.467 --> 07:49.677
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.763
Listen, um, I'm kind
of worried about Steve.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.476
Well, Carly and Zach have
only been gone three days.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.603
It's not a problem.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.563
Three beautiful women
came in this morning

08:00.646 --> 08:01.939
to place classifieds,

08:02.023 --> 08:03.065
he told me to handle it.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.109
That's a problem.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.569
Mm-hmm.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.862
{\an3}Thanks.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.326
Stevie.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.535
(clears throat)

08:14.619 --> 08:15.536
{\an3}Pep talk?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.246
{\an3}Could be.
Coming from you,

08:17.330 --> 08:18.456
that's very rich.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.208
All right,
I realize I haven't been

08:20.291 --> 08:22.251
Mr. Positive Energy these days.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.753
But work keeps me
from losing it.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.880
Acting like a vegetable
does it for me.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.465
You can't read
the box scores all day.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.467
Well, I've moved on
to the fish report.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.593
I'm proud of you.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.303
Brandon, I feel like
a loser, okay?

08:32.385 --> 08:34.554
The sports page is the one place
I can go every day

08:34.639 --> 08:35.556
and read about winners.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.265
Well, why just read about them?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.433
Why not do a sports story?

08:38.517 --> 08:40.269
Because I mope and you report.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.604
Why mess with success?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.438
Wait a minute,
don't you know some KEG guy

08:43.522 --> 08:45.274
who's marrying some woman
who works for the Dodgers?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.318
I don't like
where you're going with this.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.070
Do an interview
with Mike Piazza.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.446
He's young, he's hip,

08:50.529 --> 08:51.989
he's perfect for
our paper's demographic.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.743
Harry and Kristi
are getting married.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.119
I'm sure they're way too busy.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.580
Only one way to find out.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.959
Brandon, no.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.628
Am I annoying you yet?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.505
{\an3}Like you
wouldn't believe.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.382
Dial nine to get out.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.261
(dialing)

09:13.344 --> 09:16.138
ELLEN:
<i>A sexually transmitted disease?</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:18.015
Yeah, it's called chlamydia.

09:18.099 --> 09:22.061
{\an1}And as many as 30% of sexually
active teenage women get it.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.313
You had unprotected sex, Ellen.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.481
You could've gotten AIDS.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.150
{\an1}Instead, you got
a curable infection.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.319
{\an3}Consider
yourself lucky.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.446
{\an1}One round of oral antibiotics
should take care of it.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.282
So I don't have to tell anyone?

09:34.365 --> 09:37.034
Well, your boyfriend needs to be
treated at the same time

09:37.118 --> 09:38.828
to prevent passing the infection
back and forth.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.454
I can't do that.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.164
We know it's awkward, but...

09:42.248 --> 09:43.499
I just can't, okay?

09:43.582 --> 09:45.334
Why not?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.128
Because I didn't
get it from him.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.006
{\an3}Let's just forget the
whole thing, okay?

09:50.089 --> 09:53.175
If this remains untreated,
it could lead to infertility.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.344
I made a mistake.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.305
I love my boyfriend.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.597
Then tell him the truth.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.062
{\an3}Thank you
for that.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.147
{\an3}You were a
big help.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.648
{\an1}You would think
in this day and age,

10:07.732 --> 10:09.525
{\an1}even teenagers
would be more careful.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.193
{\an3}Or at least stick
to one partner.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.361
It's all so depressing.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.404
{\an3}(chuckles)

10:13.487 --> 10:15.865
{\an3}Well, then how about I
cheer you up over dinner?

10:15.948 --> 10:18.200
{\an3}There's a great new place
called Updike's, just opened.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.201
{\an3}Interested?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.328
{\an1}Sure.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.413
{\an3}Great.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.755
(dialing)

10:32.757 --> 10:34.508
Brandon. Hey, it's me.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.512
Listen, um, I've changed my mind
about the restaurant review.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.389
I thought maybe
we could start tonight.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
Yeah, there's a place
called Updike's.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.229
{\an1}Steve, for the last time,
you're not imposing.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.065
Are you sure? I mean,
you're getting married

10:49.148 --> 10:50.733
the day after tomorrow.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.193
{\an3}Oh!

10:52.276 --> 10:54.945
Why is it everyone says
that like I'm coming down

10:55.029 --> 10:57.740
with some disease
and I should be quarantined?

10:57.823 --> 10:59.283
{\an3}You look
beautiful.

10:59.367 --> 11:03.120
Well, all brides do
at first glance.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.457
It's when you take that close
look you begin to see things.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.417
Anyway, Kristi,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.419
{\an5}about the story.
Oh, yeah, I can get you Piazza,
no problem.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.295
He's a great guy.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.383
There's something not right.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.386
Anyway, you should know
I usually don't write.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.430
{\an6}My editor thinks
I should do this
to help me

11:21.514 --> 11:22.431
get over a busted relationship.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.225
Was it serious?

11:24.308 --> 11:26.560
Pretty serious.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.437
I thought
maybe she could be the one.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.567
What's it like to end something
so intense?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.236
{\an3}Brutal.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.113
I'm just trying to convince
myself, though,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.323
that it's, it's a big world,
you know?

11:39.407 --> 11:42.326
Lots of possibilities, big pond.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.327
Lots of fish.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.453
{\an3}Yeah,

11:44.537 --> 11:45.996
and who's to say
what makes you happy

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
at 23 is gonna keep you happy
at 33, right?

11:48.165 --> 11:49.417
Certainly not me.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.336
At my age, who needs commitment?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.838
You'd have to be nuts.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.464
{\an3}Completely.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.968
Thanks.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.302
For what?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.848
Convincing me that
what I'm doing is wrong.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.141
But...

12:05.224 --> 12:08.310
I'll never forget you for this,
Steve.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.104
No. Kristi, uh...

12:16.569 --> 12:17.945
Oh, God.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.906
(pop music playing)

12:20.990 --> 12:21.824
<i>Come on, David.</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:23.701
No keyboard player,
no gig, all right?

12:23.784 --> 12:24.994
Hey, some of their songs

12:25.077 --> 12:26.328
{\an1}don't even need
a keyboard. Right?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.496
Yeah, a couple.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.123
Maybe Mark can still play?

12:29.206 --> 12:30.082
{\an3}With a cast
on his arm?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.460
What if we had
a different keyboard player?

12:32.543 --> 12:34.503
All depends.
Who do you have in mind?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.213
{\an3}David.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.132
Yeah, wait, wait.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.550
{\an1}I haven't performed
in a long time.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.843
Oh, you're good.
Your song kills.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.094
{\an3}I mean, until
Mark gets better,

12:42.178 --> 12:43.304
I think you'd be great.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.973
You don't expect me to let you
headline, tonight, do you?

12:46.056 --> 12:46.974
What if I do?

12:47.057 --> 12:48.517
David, come on.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.311
Forget it, all right?

12:50.394 --> 12:52.521
{\an1}Let's find
somewhere else to play.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.689
Hey, just the group
I was looking for.

12:53.772 --> 12:54.690
Hey, listen,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.233
{\an3}until you're ready
to play,

12:56.317 --> 12:58.944
I was thinking David
could sit in for you.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
If things go the way
my lawyer says they will,

13:00.571 --> 13:01.697
he can replace me.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.199
Your lawyer?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
That's right. The one
who's taking him to court.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.702
For what?

13:06.785 --> 13:08.913
Lost wages, potential earnings.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.998
He feels that something

13:11.081 --> 13:12.541
in the mid-seven-figure range
should cover it.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.377
You leave here drunk, get in
an accident, you blame me?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.755
Bartender's gotta serve
and protect. You only served.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.008
{\an4}I'll laugh you out of court,
man.
Maybe.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.053
Maybe I'll take you
for everything you've got.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.229
JEFF:
So we're agreed, then?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.396
{\an3}No shop talk
at dinner.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.940
Just pure, mindless fun.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.733
Kelly.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.485
{\an3}Brandon.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.736
Dr. Stockman, I presume.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.196
Nice to meet you.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.781
You, too.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.991
Why don't I check
on the reservation?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.746
What are you doing here?

13:50.829 --> 13:53.249
{\an5}A restaurant review
for the <i> Beat.</i>
Please.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.416
Out of all the restaurants
in L.A.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.251
you picked this one tonight?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.794
What do you think,
I'm spying on you?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.087
What should I think?

13:59.713 --> 14:02.049
Enjoy your date.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.771
{\an3}Hey, sorry I'm late.
Uh, ready to eat?

14:15.854 --> 14:18.440
I just lost my appetite.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.441
Let's go home.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.164
Where's the makeup person?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.958
{\an4}Sasha got
into my lipstick
in the car.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.795
{\an3}Uh, I'm sure this
won't be a problem.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.630
I don't know what
she was thinking.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.465
She looks like a clown.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.925
She was probably thinking
it would be fun

14:45.009 --> 14:45.968
to look like a clown.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.804
I'd like you to keep
your distance from Sasha.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.307
You upset her so much yesterday,
she blew her audition.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.808
She wouldn't even read
her scene.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.184
Maybe she didn't want to.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.477
Of course she did.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.688
The singing lessons, the acting
coaches, the dancing classes.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.773
We've been working for this
for 20 years.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.567
20 years, Sasha's only eight.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.361
I was a model myself.
I'm talking about my training,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.530
which I am now passing on
to Sasha.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.409
Did you hear that?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.828
"We this, we that?"
It's not about the little girl.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.121
She wants this for herself.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.374
Raising the child is
not our job.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.542
No, it's hers.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.711
And she's too busy living
through her child to do it.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.013
{\an5}I don't know,
but I think he was...
Yeah?

15:32.431 --> 15:33.682
Good morning.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.392
Hi.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.353
Uh, my name's
Brandon Walsh.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.604
I live here.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.357
{\an3}And I'm Valerie Malone,
and I live here, too.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.358
We both live here.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.484
{\an1}VALERIE:
Yeah.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.486
{\an3}Unfortunately I got
to go to work.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.529
Um, I'm Kristi Koontz.
A friend of Steve's.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.198
We figured.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.824
Steve slept on the couch.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.371
Did I mention that I'm supposed
to be getting married tomorrow?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.372
I want details.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.040
{\an1}You got it.
Don't forget we're on

15:58.123 --> 15:59.166
{\an1}for that restaurant review
tonight.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.167
Okay.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.377
Good morning.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.504
Oh, yes, it is.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.130
{\an3}KRISTI: Hi.
Hi.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.715
{\an3}I thought, uh,
making breakfast was

16:06.799 --> 16:09.301
{\an6}a good way of
saying thanks for
what you've done.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.886
Oh!

16:10.969 --> 16:12.388
What exactly have you done?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.348
{\an3}Well, Kristi didn't
want to go home,

16:14.431 --> 16:15.349
so I let her crash.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.392
Hmm.
What?

16:16.475 --> 16:18.060
{\an3}You said you
wanted a story.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.938
{\an1}For the newspaper,
not for <i> Soap Opera Digest.</i>

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
(chuckles)

16:22.189 --> 16:23.273
Have you called Harry?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.234
He's still not back
from New York.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.151
{\an1}Don't they have phones
in New York?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.277
{\an3}Yeah, I think you owe
him a phone call.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.740
Uh, yeah, that would be
a rational response, you know,

16:31.824 --> 16:35.994
but, um, I'm just, uh, freaked,
you know?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.038
I was looking for something
wrong with the gown.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.208
And I was staring and searching,
but then I realized that

16:41.291 --> 16:42.626
the gown was perfect.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.962
But there was something wrong
with me, and...

16:45.045 --> 16:46.463
Kristi, um...

16:46.547 --> 16:49.133
God!
I have made the hugest mistake!

16:49.216 --> 16:51.468
{\an3}No, no, I like
'em crunchy.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.263
You know, the thing is
I don't know why I did it.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.931
I mean, he's, he's handsome,
he's smart

16:56.014 --> 16:57.307
and he's so good to me.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.101
So good to me. I just...

16:59.184 --> 17:00.602
I mean, it was all set;

17:00.686 --> 17:02.813
this totally perfect future
laid out before me.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.647
I just...

17:05.398 --> 17:08.277
{\an1}Too perfect
and totally scary.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.487
Been there, done that.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.490
What do you say I take you out
for breakfast?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.960
What are you
working on?

17:25.042 --> 17:27.003
Just some lyrics.

17:27.087 --> 17:31.300
Care to try 'em out?

17:31.383 --> 17:34.470
{\an1}It's supposed to be
about Valerie,

17:34.553 --> 17:35.804
but it's just
not happening.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.140
{\an1}Then let a real songwriter
take a look.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.685
Ooh, that must've hurt.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.271
Yeah, it's a million-dollar
injury. Maybe two.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.481
I'll have coffee.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.024
Dead black, thick as mud.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.319
Nat, this is Mark.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.697
He likes caffeine,
among other things.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.115
I'll get you a mug.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.495
Seriously, you want me
to take a look?

17:59.578 --> 18:00.621
What, suddenly I'm your pal?

18:00.704 --> 18:03.582
Could be. Depends on you.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.212
I saw you getting stoned
outside the club.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.379
According to the breathalyzer,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.298
it was booze
that did me in okay?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.549
And your friend was pouring it.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.218
He's not my friend.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.678
Well, then you should have no
problem keeping your mouth shut.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.846
Is that a threat?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.473
{\an1}That song of yours
we bought?

18:19.556 --> 18:20.474
It's good.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.352
People should hear it.

18:23.435 --> 18:27.564
Ah, and let me guess. They won't
if I don't keep my mouth shut.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.192
It's a big chance for you;
sitting in for me,

18:30.275 --> 18:31.068
maybe cutting your own song.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.278
You could make a name
for yourself.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.282
And one word to Jasper,
I'll make sure you don't.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.249
We'll have the test results
for you this afternoon.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.668
{\an3}Is that what you told
the other guy, too?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.336
With your permission,

18:49.419 --> 18:52.256
I've asked Kelly to talk
a little about safe sex.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.383
Talk to Ellen!

18:54.466 --> 18:56.093
We already did.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.179
{\an3}She told you
the truth.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.222
Most people don't.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.516
Is that supposed to make up
for what she did?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.434
Look, Tim, what's the most
important thing to you

19:04.518 --> 19:05.435
in a relationship?

19:05.519 --> 19:06.728
I don't know.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.896
Love.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.024
That feeling you can't get rid
of even if you want to.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.568
{\an3}JEFF:
See, I say trust.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.279
But okay, we'll go with love.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.406
{\an3}Now if you love
somebody

19:17.489 --> 19:19.074
{\an3}and you've amped up
the risk factor

19:19.157 --> 19:21.076
by having sex with somebody
else, don't you think

19:21.159 --> 19:23.412
you owe it to that person
to let 'em know?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.955
Even if it costs you
your relationship?

19:26.456 --> 19:27.916
'Cause not being honest could
cost them their life.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.711
What are you saying,
she did a good thing?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.921
{\an3}No, she broke
your trust.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.341
All I'm saying is maybe
she's trying to win it back.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.260
Whether or not

19:38.343 --> 19:39.720
you let her, that's up to you.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.814
(hushed conversation)

20:02.409 --> 20:03.452
Here's yesterday's shots.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.411
For a little girl,

20:04.494 --> 20:06.038
{\an3}Sasha's certainly got
a memorable look.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.333
{\an1}Absolutely, that's why
we hired her.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.293
Even if she is a brat.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.712
{\an1}A brat we've committed a lot
of advertising dollars to.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.508
Was Kim complaining
about something else?

20:18.592 --> 20:21.094
{\an1}Donna, I'm sure
you realize

20:21.178 --> 20:23.430
it's too late to make a change.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.348
With Sasha, I mean.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.224
{\an1}Her face is already
out there.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.267
She's the...

20:27.351 --> 20:29.102
the Child's Play child.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.272
I realize things
have been kind of rough,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.942
so I'm open to suggestions
how I can make it easier.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.610
Well, I guess you can...

20:37.736 --> 20:39.780
start by looking
for another job.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.823
You're kidding, right?

20:41.907 --> 20:44.618
The clothing,
it's based on my designs.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.162
I know, and they're terrific,

20:47.245 --> 20:48.872
{\an1}and believe me.
you'll get everything

20:48.956 --> 20:51.208
that's coming to you,
but I can't risk this shoot.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.918
I can't believe
that your firing me

20:53.001 --> 20:55.003
because I wouldn't give in
to a spoiled child.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.797
Terrible business, isn't it?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.925
The way you're doing it, yes,
it certainly is.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.852
{\an3}Must be nice
working at home.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.480
Yeah, it is

21:13.563 --> 21:15.524
when things are quiet.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.484
Oh, uh these are Valerie's.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.486
{\an3}I'll return them,
I swear.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.904
I'll be out of here soon.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.031
Now you've got
a big decision to make.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.366
You want to be right.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.701
Yeah.

21:25.784 --> 21:30.205
(knocking)

21:30.288 --> 21:32.374
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.209
{\an1}MAN:
Sanders!

21:34.292 --> 21:35.377
Come on. I know she's in there.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.379
Sounds like Harry.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.131
For some reason,
he doesn't sound pleased.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.090
No.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.383
{\an1}Kristi,

21:41.466 --> 21:43.719
honey, I, I talked to Margo.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.470
My maid of honor.
I told her not to blab.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.431
Come on, Kristi.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.099
{\an1}Come on outside.
Let-let's get in the car.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.559
I can't. I'm not ready.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
I don't know
what to say.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.937
Brandon, let's get out of here.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.230
I can't do that.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.357
I need to think.
He's gonna be mad.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.900
Well, he doesn't sound mad.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.068
{\an1}Kristi!

22:00.152 --> 22:01.737
Remember, what you said
about things being too perfect

22:01.820 --> 22:03.864
{\an3}but totally frightening?
Lucky guess?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.949
I felt like you knew what
I was going through. Please.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.077
Please.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.621
All right. We can go
through the kitchen.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.873
Brandon!

22:12.956 --> 22:14.249
Steve, don't worry about it.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.584
I'll say something nice
at your funeral.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.590
{\an3}Harry, hi.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.468
How 'bout them Dodgers?

22:35.020 --> 22:38.440
25.6 ounces per bottle.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.401
{\an1}Wow. How many bottles in
a case? What, 12?

22:41.485 --> 22:42.652
{\an1}How long does it take you
to go through this?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.154
I don't have a clue.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.449
When I get low,
I re-order it.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.911
Someone drinks too much,
do you, uh, cut them off?

22:50.994 --> 22:53.121
{\an3}I do what I'm
supposed to do.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.790
How do you know
when it's too much, huh?

22:54.873 --> 22:56.458
Three, four drinks, what?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.001
And what <i> if...</i>

22:58.085 --> 23:00.462
What if they went out to
another bar earlier that night?

23:00.545 --> 23:01.963
Keep an eye on them.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.965
Did Mark go
to another bar that night?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.384
Did you see him drink?

23:05.467 --> 23:08.303
Did your lawyer tell you
to ask me that?

23:08.386 --> 23:09.846
No, he told me to settle.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.307
Why, if you know you're right?

23:12.390 --> 23:13.975
To make it go away.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.811
See, criminally,
I'm not responsible.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.479
But Mark can still sue me
for negligence.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.815
Ah.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.024
Were you negligent?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.275
Look, he drove drunk.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.152
I think
he's responsible for that.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.822
But he wasn't thinking
straight, and you were.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.490
At least you should have been,

23:28.573 --> 23:30.283
you know, if you're running
a place like this.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.535
Yeah, you ran it so well.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.286
{\an1}At least
I was careful.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.832
See, I didn't have the money
to buy my way out of mistakes.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.500
But you didn't have to.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.417
I did that for you.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.838
Is there a reason
for your visit, man?

23:42.921 --> 23:47.384
Yeah. Just came by to say
I really hope you get nailed.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.941
<i>For the last time,</i>

24:03.024 --> 24:04.526
I just wanted an interview
with Mike Piazza.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.821
{\an3}No, no. I go to New York,
we're getting married.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.990
You, you talk to her for
ten minutes, we're not.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.867
I just said there were
other fish in the sea.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.494
For me.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.706
Where is she? She's hiding
upstairs, isn't she? Yeah.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.042
{\an1}Harry, I told you.
I don't know where she is.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.336
Kristi!

24:23.420 --> 24:25.589
Kristi?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.340
We are getting married tomorrow.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.341
{\an3}Harry, I know
that's the plan...

24:28.425 --> 24:31.344
No, I said, "we are."

24:31.428 --> 24:33.513
Kristi?

24:33.597 --> 24:34.556
(knocking)

24:34.639 --> 24:36.683
Kristi?

24:38.476 --> 24:41.229
{\an1}Can you imagine
what she looks like in that?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.065
Harry, I know this is
gonna be hard to hear.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.567
But she's having
second thoughts.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.320
She can't be.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.405
{\an1}Harry...
No.

24:50.488 --> 24:55.035
She can't. I, uh...

24:55.118 --> 24:57.329
I can't live without her.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.248
I know you feel
that way now...

25:00.332 --> 25:01.625
but that'll change.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.793
No, it won't.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.421
{\an1}Not tomorrow.
Not-Not next week.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.090
{\an3}Not if she got on a plane
and moved to Montana?

25:09.174 --> 25:12.135
Not if I never
see her another day.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.305
You love her that much?

25:15.388 --> 25:17.599
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.603
I thought I did,

25:23.897 --> 25:25.774
but I guess I don't.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.401
Yeah.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.379
Well, let me guess.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.257
{\an3}This little visit has
something to do with Noah.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.969
Hello to you, too.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.303
Sorry.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.763
It just, you know...

25:56.846 --> 25:58.306
{\an3}seems like every
time we see each other

25:58.390 --> 26:00.433
that's all we talk about.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.146
You okay?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.815
Nope.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.483
I just got fired.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.653
Fired?

26:11.736 --> 26:14.948
{\an3}From the whole
Child's Play organization?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.658
I thought they loved
what you were doing.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.119
Yeah, my designs.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.205
{\an1}Obviously not my
people handling skills.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.417
I'm sorry.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.168
You want to know
the worst part about it?

26:27.252 --> 26:28.503
Hmm?

26:28.586 --> 26:30.338
I didn't do anything wrong.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.506
Nothing.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.633
So, what happened?

26:35.302 --> 26:38.138
This mom was treating her
daughter badly, so I told her.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.347
{\an3}That's it?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.641
They fired you
for looking out for a kid?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.518
Next time you want
to do the right thing...

26:43.601 --> 26:45.020
think twice before you do it.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.481
Get out of here.
You don't really believe that.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.693
This was my dream job.

26:51.776 --> 26:55.488
{\an1}You know it's-it's like
if you had to choose

26:55.572 --> 27:00.035
{\an1}between being in the band
and, I don't know...

27:00.118 --> 27:02.537
Telling the truth, even
if you didn't want to?

27:02.620 --> 27:03.872
Yeah. What would you do?

27:03.955 --> 27:07.208
What if you got a do-over?

27:07.292 --> 27:10.420
I'd still do the same thing.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.381
Really? Even if it meant
getting fired again?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.592
Yeah, even if.

27:15.675 --> 27:18.386
Why?

27:18.470 --> 27:23.433
Because I think if you've got
to do the wrong thing

27:23.516 --> 27:29.314
to get what you want,
it probably wasn't worth having.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.567
Mmm.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.418
How's your dog?

27:50.502 --> 27:51.252
{\an3}Perfect.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.338
{\an3}Just like my
relationship with Harry.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.757
I'm surprised I'm not
repelled by it, too.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.842
{\an1}It's cause it's not asking you
for a commitment.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.220
{\an3}Brandon, what is
wrong with me?

28:00.303 --> 28:03.932
Nothing, you just, um....

28:04.015 --> 28:05.600
{\an1}You just got jitters,
that's all.

28:05.683 --> 28:08.103
This constitutes jitters.

28:08.186 --> 28:12.232
{\an1}When it's "till death do us
part," I'd say so. Yeah.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.443
{\an3}Is that what
happened to you?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.404
No.

28:17.487 --> 28:23.118
{\an1}No. We were, um...
we were very committed.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.120
{\an1}I just made
a mistake, that's all.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.456
We had a great relationship.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.460
I guess the fact is the
better the relationship,

28:32.544 --> 28:33.962
the scarier it is.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.840
Yeah. We had a perfect one.

28:36.923 --> 28:40.301
{\an3}Poor thing. It must
have been hell.

28:40.385 --> 28:44.305
There's only one thing worse.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.433
Not being in it anymore.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.695
Ellen?

28:58.778 --> 28:59.946
{\an1}Hi.
Hi.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.156
What are you doing here?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.490
Tim's in with the doctor.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.450
{\an1}He's getting his
prescription filled.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.659
Ah.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.202
{\an1}It must have been hard
for you to tell him.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.163
You have no idea.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.165
{\an1}Well, if you're here with him,
that's a good sign.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.667
He told me he doesn't think
he'll be able to trust me again.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.294
I am so stupid.

29:14.377 --> 29:17.839
{\an1}It's okay. You guys
can get through this.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.340
After I told him...

29:19.424 --> 29:21.634
{\an3}I mean, after he calmed
down, you know what he said?

29:21.718 --> 29:24.846
He said that giving me a second
chance is like saying a prayer.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.640
It can't do any harm, but
it might do a lot of good.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.017
He said that?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.351
Isn't that incredible?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.728
Yeah, it is.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.481
Come on, let's go.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.524
{\an1}Bye.
Bye, guys.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.029
{\an1}Oh, tell me he didn't
take her back.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.031
Ever the romantic.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.283
Well, you wouldn't
take Brandon back.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.452
Don't you have a
toilet to clean?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.792
{\an3}Just ten more
minutes, I promise.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.045
{\an3}That's what you said an
hour ago. I want to go home.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.255
I thought you wanted
to go to the circus.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.882
{\an1}I thought I made it clear
this morning that...

30:00.965 --> 30:01.883
Right, right.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.718
{\an1}I'm fired, but there were
no guards at the gate.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.094
I want the circus.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.095
I want the circus.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.347
Now, look what you've done.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.098
Well, she said she wanted to go.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.058
But we're not going.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.227
Well, that's why
I brought the circus to you.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.561
Well, part of it at least.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.439
{\an1}You do like clowns,
don't you?

30:16.523 --> 30:18.191
I don't believe this.

30:18.274 --> 30:19.526
Mommy, look at Donna!

30:19.609 --> 30:21.569
Do a trick. Please?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.113
Um, Sasha, Kim, why don't we try
to get one more shot?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.115
Then we'll take a break.
What do you think, honey?

30:26.199 --> 30:28.034
I think she wants to play.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.369
Well, she didn't ask you.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.578
Oh, right.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.247
Sorry.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.415
Why don't we finish up here,
all right?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.292
And then you can play.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.919
If it's only one more shot.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.837
Okay. If Donna stays.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.381
It's all right with me.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.384
Well, I guess
it's all right with me.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.428
Ah, now, that's the spirit.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.433
(buzzing loudly)

30:52.517 --> 30:54.519
(laughing)

30:57.188 --> 30:58.481
You're alive.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.732
Yeah, no thanks to you.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.067
Where's, uh, Harry?

31:01.150 --> 31:04.112
{\an1}Uh, he's looking for you.
Waiting for your call.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.614
{\an3}Call... Ah, I
forgot to call Val

31:06.698 --> 31:08.449
{\an3}and tell her our
restaurant review is off.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.826
{\an3}Um, if you need
some privacy,

31:09.909 --> 31:11.327
{\an3}you can use the
phone up in my room.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.662
Thanks.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.291
(dialing phone)

31:16.374 --> 31:19.460
(phone rings)

31:19.544 --> 31:20.420
Hello. Wyatt Clinic.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.629
BRANDON:
Hello. Val?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.298
Hey, are we
on for tonight or what?

31:23.381 --> 31:25.466
I'm afraid not.
Kristi is still here.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.051
Is she paying rent yet?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.761
She's in trouble, Val.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.138
I think I understand why.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.806
Details at 11:00, huh?

31:31.889 --> 31:33.474
Down, girl. Apology accepted?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.936
As always. See ya.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.480
Hey, Kelly, uh,
my car won't start.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.690
Would you mind
giving me a ride home?

31:40.773 --> 31:42.650
All right.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.944
Thanks.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.126
Hey.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.127
You got a minute?

32:01.210 --> 32:04.505
{\an3}Yeah, sure.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.007
{\an1}Look, man,
you were right.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.175
I've been careless.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.134
{\an3}Look, um...

32:08.217 --> 32:09.677
I might have been a
little hard on you.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.054
I don't think you were.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.014
I mean, I should have
been counting drinks.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.932
{\an1}I just never
thought to do it.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.059
So, what are you saying?

32:16.142 --> 32:17.185
You're responsible
for what happened?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.394
{\an1}I'll never know
for sure.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.313
Yeah, I was responsible enough.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.898
So, what are you going
to do about it?

32:21.981 --> 32:23.316
I'm going to settle.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.193
No fuss, no muss.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.070
You're wrong if you think this
doesn't cost me, okay?

32:27.153 --> 32:29.030
What? What, a couple
interest payments?

32:29.113 --> 32:31.449
I drove drunk before, okay?
It cost me everything I had.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.118
How do you think
this makes me feel?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.454
Just knowing I put somebody else
in the same position?

32:41.501 --> 32:43.711
Thanks for giving me a lift.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.339
That's okay, I need to
talk to Brandon anyway.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.382
{\an3}About what?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.426
None of your business, Val.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.095
So, did you talk to Harry yet?

32:52.178 --> 32:53.388
{\an3}Finally.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.764
We had the best talk.

32:54.847 --> 32:56.391
So, everything's
on for tomorrow?

32:56.474 --> 32:58.601
Yeah, thanks to you and Steve.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.395
{\an3}Oh, God!

33:01.312 --> 33:02.271
Brandon?

33:02.355 --> 33:04.899
{\an3}Uh, there's somebody
here to see you.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.320
I can explain this.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.406
{\an3}Don't bother.
Kel!

33:11.489 --> 33:13.408
I know what you're
thinking and you're wrong.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.867
{\an3}I was just

33:14.951 --> 33:15.868
thanking Brandon.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.829
I'm getting married tomorrow.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.498
She's getting married tomorrow.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.250
Well, I'm glad I was wrong.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.252
But that's the problem.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.378
I'll always think the worst.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.296
That's what happens
when you lose someone's trust.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.231
{\an3}PHOTOGRAPHER:
Very nice!

33:45.314 --> 33:46.816
That's it, Sasha, very good.

33:46.899 --> 33:49.444
Hands on your hips now.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.279
{\an3}Good one!

33:51.362 --> 33:52.780
Oh, that's nice.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.449
You wanted to talk to me?

33:54.532 --> 33:55.950
Donna, thanks for coming.

33:56.033 --> 33:57.618
{\an5}Guess what,
guess what?!
What?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.412
{\an3}I'm going to the
circus today.

33:59.495 --> 34:00.955
You are? Good.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.458
Just a couple more then
we're going, right, Mom?

34:03.541 --> 34:05.293
That's right, sweetheart.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.463
Last night after you left,

34:08.545 --> 34:09.964
I haven't seen her that happy

34:10.047 --> 34:11.632
in a long time.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.050
She was acting like...

34:13.134 --> 34:13.760
Like a kid?

34:13.842 --> 34:15.303
Yeah.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.764
I pushed her because
I wanted her to have

34:17.847 --> 34:19.306
the things that I didn't have.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.933
And you showed me
that I pushed too hard.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.101
Thank you.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.978
{\an3}Donna,

34:24.061 --> 34:27.482
Kim and I have talked
about your, uh, situation.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.440
Really?

34:28.524 --> 34:29.817
{\an3}Yes.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.735
Well, you've more than proven
you can handle talent.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.322
I'd like you to come back

34:34.405 --> 34:35.822
and supervise
the Child's Play account.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.324
You want to hire me back?

34:37.408 --> 34:38.117
You're very talented.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.286
I was just as talented
yesterday.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.330
I know.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.331
I'm sorry about what happened.

34:44.415 --> 34:45.792
{\an3}Well,

34:45.875 --> 34:47.001
you've proven,
with the clown suit

34:47.085 --> 34:48.043
and all, that...
I didn't put on

34:48.127 --> 34:49.712
the clown suit
to get my job back.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.339
{\an1}I did it

34:51.422 --> 34:52.465
to keep a promise
to a little girl.

34:52.547 --> 34:54.467
But I will come back

34:54.550 --> 34:55.467
on one condition.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.428
{\an1}Name it.
That I set

34:57.512 --> 34:59.472
the hours for this child
and any other child.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.724
If I say halt,
you gotta back me up here.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.311
Good! Good one!

35:05.394 --> 35:06.395
Deal.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.647
All right.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.692
(chuckling)

35:13.986 --> 35:18.366
Okay, my last two hours of
community service are complete.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.409
{\an1}If you could be so kind
as to sign that,

35:20.493 --> 35:24.705
{\an1}I can return to society
as a free woman.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.374
You're still not upset
about seeing Brandon

35:26.457 --> 35:27.667
with that other woman, are you?

35:27.750 --> 35:29.210
I mean, I thought you moved on.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.378
Valerie, if you had a heart,

35:30.461 --> 35:31.838
you'd know that
it still hurts.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.340
Well, look on the bright side.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.509
{\an1}At least you caught him
in the act this time, huh?

35:38.469 --> 35:40.304
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.223
{\an1}Hey.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.391
{\an3}Hi.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.518
Are you okay?

35:45.601 --> 35:48.229
{\an3}You know the guy that
called when you were over?

35:48.312 --> 35:51.858
{\an3}The one that we ran into
at the restaurant?

35:51.941 --> 35:54.360
{\an3}I was living with him
until recently.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.736
(chuckles)

35:55.820 --> 35:58.364
Well, like I said,
everybody's got a past.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.116
Well, he cheated on me.

36:00.199 --> 36:03.911
Look, it's obvious you're
still struggling with this.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.582
I just want you to know
that between you and me,

36:07.665 --> 36:10.251
I'll go whatever pace you want.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.961
Thanks.

36:13.462 --> 36:17.091
{\an3}And you know what
you said about trust

36:17.174 --> 36:18.134
{\an3}being the most
important thing?

36:18.217 --> 36:19.093
Yeah?

36:19.176 --> 36:20.761
I think you were right.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.437
See ya.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.771
Leaving already?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.815
Yeah, my work here is done.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.536
(guests applauding)

36:52.877 --> 36:55.296
(chuckling)

36:55.379 --> 36:57.131
Looks like she's actually
gonna go through with it.

36:57.214 --> 36:59.091
Yeah, was there
ever any doubt?

36:59.175 --> 37:00.801
Uh, yeah.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.262
No, not the way
Harry loves her.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.015
No, he wasn't about to let
anything get in their way.

37:06.098 --> 37:09.310
{\an3}Well, you and Harry
certainly bonded.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.313
He taught me a few things.

37:12.396 --> 37:16.609
{\an1}You know, he would've
followed her to Montana.

37:16.692 --> 37:19.487
{\an3}And since you didn't follow
Carly to Montana then...

37:19.570 --> 37:21.530
{\an1}Must not have been
true love, huh?

37:24.533 --> 37:25.493
That's what he said!

37:25.576 --> 37:26.452
Did you ever notice

37:26.535 --> 37:28.621
{\an1}all the attractive women
there are at weddings?

37:28.704 --> 37:32.333
Welcome back, brother.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.417
It's good to be back.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.839
It was a lovely ceremony, guys.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.925
Steve cried like a little baby.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.343
{\an1}It wouldn't have happened
without you guys.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.345
{\an1}KRISTI:
As soon as we get back

37:44.428 --> 37:46.347
from the honeymoon, uh,
Piazza is all yours.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.890
Thanks.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.350
Sure.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.519
I hope last night didn't
make things worse for you.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.895
No, I don't think so.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.689
I don't think things
could get worse.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.399
Perfect is good.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.525
Hold on to it.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.443
I just hope I get the chance.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.195
Congratulations.

38:01.278 --> 38:02.238
Thanks.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.072
Congratulations.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.699
{\an3}Good luck.
Thanks!

38:04.782 --> 38:06.534
Bye!
(laughing)

38:06.617 --> 38:08.494
Bye!

38:22.299 --> 38:23.384
(answering machine beeps)

38:23.467 --> 38:24.552
BRANDON:
Hey, Kel, it's me.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.387
Just wanted you to know,
in case you were wondering,

38:26.470 --> 38:28.431
that Steve and I will be
at the church today

38:28.514 --> 38:30.266
for Kristi's wedding.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.143
I hope we can talk later.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.145
I miss you.
(machine beeps)

38:35.980 --> 38:37.148
{\an1}KELLY:
Hi.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.233
Hey, you done at the
clinic for the day?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.235
Yes, I am free of Valerie.

38:41.318 --> 38:43.070
{\an1}It's weird, she was the one
doing community service,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.364
but I was the one who was
relieved that she was done.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.866
That's our Val.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.075
It was kind of creepy

38:48.159 --> 38:49.201
having her around.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.953
I never knew what she was up to.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.414
But she was probably
up to something.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.749
It was like she was trying

38:54.832 --> 38:57.043
to mess things up
between me and Brandon.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.419
As if things
could get any worse.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.921
Any messages?

39:01.005 --> 39:02.548
Brandon.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.258
Well, he's persistent.

39:04.341 --> 39:05.301
Do you want to hear?

39:05.384 --> 39:06.177
No.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.429
No.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.685
(knocking on door)

39:16.687 --> 39:18.105
Hey.
Hey.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.273
{\an3}Hey, thanks
for coming by.

39:19.356 --> 39:20.357
{\an3}Come on in.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.652
So, you said you had some
band business to discuss?

39:23.736 --> 39:26.405
Um, yeah.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.657
Look, I really want to talk
about this whole lawsuit

39:28.741 --> 39:30.284
thing with Noah.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.577
Did you forget our little chat?

39:31.660 --> 39:33.871
No, I just disagree with it.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.291
I saw Mark getting
high outside the club

39:37.375 --> 39:38.292
the night of
the accident.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.293
Yeah, so?

39:39.376 --> 39:41.128
Pot and alcohol don't mix.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.463
I mean, they turn somebody

39:42.546 --> 39:43.964
that's slightly buzzed
into a blind drunk.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.132
The guy served me
when he shouldn't have.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.425
Two drinks, maybe three.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.469
Come on, the rest
you did on your own.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.929
Tell anybody that
and you're out of the band.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.975
(sighing)

39:55.059 --> 39:56.310
Then I guess I'm out.

39:56.393 --> 39:57.311
No, you're not.

39:57.394 --> 39:58.771
{\an1}MARK:
What?

39:58.854 --> 40:00.314
It's him or me.

40:00.397 --> 40:01.607
Then it's him.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.111
I'm out of here.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.036
Thanks.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.162
The guy's a jerk.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.956
(chuckling):
Yeah.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.332
{\an1}He's also
a solid player.

40:18.415 --> 40:22.169
Just don't make me
regret doing this.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.921
I won't, thanks.

40:33.597 --> 40:36.642
{\an3}Hey. What's the deal
with the work situation?

40:36.725 --> 40:38.561
{\an1}Well, they offered
me my job back.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.812
Did you take it?

40:39.895 --> 40:42.481
Yeah, on my terms.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.983
Well, congratulations.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.359
Thanks.

40:45.442 --> 40:48.863
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.532
So, have you talked
to Mark's attorney?

40:51.615 --> 40:52.992
Not since I made
a settlement offer.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.201
I have a feeling

40:54.285 --> 40:55.661
you'll be surprised
with what you hear.

40:55.744 --> 40:57.329
How so?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.540
Mark was more high
than drunk that night.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.584
{\an1}The accident
was his fault,

41:01.667 --> 41:02.877
not yours.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.045
You know that?

41:05.129 --> 41:06.714
Even better, he knows I know it.

41:06.797 --> 41:07.965
He has no case.

41:08.048 --> 41:10.050
Well, the band members

41:10.134 --> 41:11.385
can't be happy
that you crossed them.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.386
A wise person once

41:12.469 --> 41:14.555
told me that if you had
to do the wrong thing

41:14.638 --> 41:16.223
to get what you wanted,
it probably wasn't

41:16.307 --> 41:17.391
worth having in the first place.

41:17.474 --> 41:18.559
I'm proud of you.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.311
No big deal.
I'm still in the band.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.063
Look, I'm gonna keep an
eye on people from now on.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.982
I owe you for that.

41:25.065 --> 41:26.692
What do you say
we put that up against

41:26.775 --> 41:28.611
all the things I owe you

41:28.694 --> 41:30.988
and... we call it even?

41:31.697 --> 41:33.282
I'd like that, man.

41:34.491 --> 41:35.451
So would I.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.630
(knocking on door)

41:49.798 --> 41:51.091
Two minutes, that's all I need.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.260
I'm listening.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.262
I know why I did it now.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.931
I didn't realize
it was a mystery.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.058
Things were too perfect.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.601
That's a new one.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.937
I'm telling you.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.438
They were too perfect, I was,

42:04.521 --> 42:07.441
I was, I was scared,
I-I didn't want to settle down.

42:07.524 --> 42:08.317
I-I panicked.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.777
And now you know better.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.695
Absolutely.
It'll never happen again.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.365
What do you want Brandon?

42:14.448 --> 42:15.449
I want another chance.

42:15.532 --> 42:16.784
I think you owe me that much.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.118
I don't owe you anything.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.746
I'm telling you, Kelly,
I'll do whatever you want.

42:20.829 --> 42:22.998
I want you to leave me alone.
