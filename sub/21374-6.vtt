they just beat the number one team
in the nation last week,

They scored 51
against the number one team in the nation,

01:03.856 --> 01:08.026

so it's a big difference in there.

They just couldn't make it there,

10:44.144 --> 10:47.063
did something, got in trouble
and got sent back down, and...

10:47.147 --> 10:50.233
All of our players came from high school,
you know what I'm saying?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.569
<i>So, the level is different.</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:53.695
Thank you, thank you.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.532
We have the best water crew
in the world, I think.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.095
- And also the most beautiful. Water crew.
- [woman] Thank you.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.413
- I gotta compliment 'em.
- [woman] All right.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.457
[Rejohn] <i>Originally, I was at Co-Lin,</i>

11:05.540 --> 11:09.085
and I got redshirted there,
then I got cut.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.088
So, Coahoma gave me a chance.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.007
[indistinct chatter]

11:15.425 --> 11:16.426
[player 1] You ugly.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.011
Hey, look, look, look. Look at him.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.598
[player 2] That boy got so mad, dog.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.351
What's that coach's name?
Coach Stephens?

11:24.434 --> 11:25.727
[players] Coach Buddy Stephens.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.038
- That man got in a fight with a referee.
- Yeah, we saw.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.356
He squared up with the referee.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.274
Referee gave Buddy Stephens a beatin'.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.359
Man, I swear he...

11:32.442 --> 11:34.569
- He gave Buddy Stephens...
- He threw a jab at him.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.739
[Miller] <i>Watchin' the Netflix series,</i>
<i>and they say</i> Last Chance U,

11:38.323 --> 11:39.449
it's kinda...

11:40.283 --> 11:44.161
It's more like <i>Second Chance U</i>
at a team like East.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.999
<i>Players can come in from Division I.
They get a second chance.</i>

11:48.082 --> 11:52.169
But the kid comes to Coahoma, it was
their last chance to get on the field.

11:52.254 --> 11:56.674
They was not recruited,
not scholarship players by any means.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.970
Well, that's your last chance
to get on the field and prove yourself.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.348
[coach] Throw! Throw! Right there.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.352
Let's go.
Snag, snag, snag, snag, snag...

12:07.435 --> 12:09.705
[Brady Burse] <i>They should be fine</i>
<i>playing East Mississippi.</i>

12:09.729 --> 12:10.769
<i>I've heard they were good.</i>

12:10.813 --> 12:13.734
I know somebody from Olive Branch
that came from the high school I was at.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.820
TJ Jallow, plays corner.
I know he's pretty good.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.241
And their defensive line is probably good.
They're good every year.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.492
<i>I mean, we're 0-7,</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:24.994
<i>but you can tell
we got talent for next year.</i>

12:25.077 --> 12:27.038
[indistinct chatter]

12:29.332 --> 12:32.092
[Ed Holly] All right, here we go.
Listen, I got the floor. Now listen.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.045
It's a 6:30 game. We're leavin' earlier.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.548
Make time to get treatment
and take care of your body.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.383
Hydrate, do what you're supposed to do.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.027
When we go to Coahoma,
we're goin' on a business trip.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.887
This ain't sightseein'.
We ain't goin' to listen to blues music.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.972
We're goin' there to play a football game.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.392
No matter what the conditions are,
no matter where we are,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.769
or where we go, we play like Lions.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.604
All right. Grab a Lion, baby. Here we go.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.832
- [Chauncey] Kam, take a shower on three.
- [players chuckle]

12:53.856 --> 12:55.858
One D on me. One D on three.
One! Two! Three!

12:55.942 --> 12:56.943
[all] One D!

12:57.026 --> 12:58.712
[Isaiah] <i>I ain't gonna say</i>
<i>that they're booty, booty.</i>

12:58.736 --> 13:02.490
They ain't gonna just let us
come out there and whoop their ass.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.492
They're gonna give us some effort.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.216
- [Vijay chuckles]
- Their record's sorry.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.471
- I mean...
- [interviewer] What's their record?

13:07.495 --> 13:08.496
[Vijay] They haven't won.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.541
[Isaiah] You're never supposed to
take a game off, or a play off,

13:11.624 --> 13:13.710
no matter how bad the team is,
no matter what.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.836
You're supposed to play.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.004
You always have your chance
to win your first game.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.088
No matter what.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.966
[players chuckle]

13:20.675 --> 13:22.427
[indistinct chatter]

13:26.263 --> 13:28.099
- Hey, Isaiah.
- [Isaiah] Hey.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.060
- What's up?
- Um...

13:32.354 --> 13:34.188
Did you get that e-mail from Mr. Johnson?

13:34.271 --> 13:37.650
[Wagner] It's too late to register you
for an online class.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.735
No, it's not.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.613
- Says who?
- Says him.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.616
[sighs] Okay,
I can't do that right now, but...

13:46.283 --> 13:47.326
I'll, um...

13:47.410 --> 13:49.347
- [Isaiah] Okay, 'cause...
- [Wagner] ...look into it.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.164
I'm not gonna be able to pass that class.
I can pass it if...

13:52.248 --> 13:54.959
- No, you can pass it being in a classroom.
- No, I really can't.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.920
Look, there's not even a way
for me to come out with a D.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.007
Okay, well,
I'm working with him right now,

14:01.090 --> 14:02.592
so when I get done with him,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.845
I will look into getting you
in an online class.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.640
All right.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.149
[Wagner] <i>What's wrong with Isaiah?</i>
<i>He had a boot.</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:17.911
[Diamante Pounds]
You can tell he was hurt.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.276
- [Wagner] You could? Really?
- Like, he was really hurt.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.279
He stayed down. His face was red.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.408
And then he got up.
He got to limping. Damn.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.537
[Wagner] I thought that was
our best game yet.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.749
We finally came together on both sides
of the ball and played a complete game.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.876
- Yep!
- Very good job.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.295
Thank you, Miss Brittany.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.714
Y'all did awesome.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.925
And y'all whooped their tail.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.843
I think we'll jump to number two.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.888
'Cause they'll probably put
Garden City in front of us.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.515
I don't know. It depends.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.185
We may jump to three, they may do...

14:54.268 --> 14:56.414
- Garden City, Arizona Western, then us.
- No, we gonna jump.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.648
No, we gonna be in the top two.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.232
- How you know?
- Just 'cause.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.819
No, we really...
We probably gonna be in the top two.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.612
I think we'll be in the top two.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.428
[radio host 1] <i>Four Mississippi JUCOs</i>
<i>ranked in the top 18 in the country.</i>

15:10.452 --> 15:12.704
<i>East Mississippi
is the number three team in the nation,</i>

15:12.787 --> 15:16.999
<i>Garden City, Kansas, is number one.
Arizona Western is ranked number two.</i>

15:17.083 --> 15:18.310
[radio host 2] <i>Look at East Mississippi.</i>

15:18.334 --> 15:21.045
<i>Ranked third in the country.
They are 6-1 right now.</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:23.673
<i>Last Saturday, a 51-32 homecoming win</i>

15:23.756 --> 15:27.093
<i>over then number one ranked
Northwest Mississippi.</i>

15:27.176 --> 15:28.260
<i>Put up 51 on the Rangers.</i>

15:28.344 --> 15:31.431
[radio host 1] <i>Boy, guys.</i>
<i>Again, it's just that logjam,</i>

15:31.514 --> 15:34.767
<i>where you have a half a dozen teams
chasing two spots.</i>

15:34.851 --> 15:37.019
[player] Ain't no way
they just moved us to three.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.664
[Wagner] They did?
The rankings came out?

15:38.688 --> 15:42.066
Ain't no way you set a team back
like that when they blowing people out.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.919
Especially when they did
the number one team like that.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.295
[player] Last year they did the same.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.321
They did the same shit last year.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.116
Think about it, bro,
we beat the number one team.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.619
- That's what made me so mad, bro.
- [laughs]

15:52.702 --> 15:54.954
Number three? [chuckles]

15:55.037 --> 15:56.581
- One spot away.
- [indistinct chatter]

15:56.664 --> 16:01.043
I'm not really excited about the way
we were doing on the ranks.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.255
I mean, I feel like we should have been
a strong number two.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.425
You know, you beat the number one team,
we could have put up 70 points on 'em.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.720
It shouldn't be a question
who should be number one.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.971
We should be number one.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.641
I don't want Buddy
to let up off the throttle.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.976
If we can put points on the board,
we need to put 'em on.

16:23.566 --> 16:24.692
[Miller] Zulu.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.779
Right there, Antowyne! Right there, good!

16:27.862 --> 16:29.446
Hey. Great job, y'all two.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.116
If y'all do that all night,
y'all three gonna have fuckin' sacks.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.367
[players] Let's go, Kenon!

16:33.450 --> 16:34.512
- [player 1] Got 'em!
- [player 2] Ooh!

16:34.536 --> 16:36.287
- [players laughing]
- Got 'em!

16:36.370 --> 16:40.374
I don't think Buddy runs a score up
to intimidate anybody,

16:40.457 --> 16:42.794
but I think he gets the scores on a board

16:42.877 --> 16:45.462
to get all the voters
and the computer rankings

16:45.547 --> 16:49.300
so that his team don't get left out
for being in the Mississippi league

16:49.383 --> 16:50.635
where you get a one loss,

16:50.718 --> 16:53.012
but you get bumped out
the national championship race

16:53.095 --> 16:54.138
just because of that.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.640
[cheering]

16:55.723 --> 16:59.143
<i>To come out of the Mississippi league,
you got to be very, very impressive.</i>

16:59.226 --> 17:02.104
<i>I think we had the most score
they ever scored in a game by East.</i>

17:02.188 --> 17:04.023
<i>It was 90-something points.</i>

17:04.106 --> 17:05.191
[player grunts]

17:05.274 --> 17:09.696
But at the same time, some lose
self-esteem in the game of football

17:09.779 --> 17:11.238
after a game like that.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.283
<i>You know,
where the score is just outrageous.</i>

17:14.366 --> 17:18.120
<i>You can see the kids on that Coahoma team
never played football much after that.</i>

17:18.204 --> 17:21.583
<i>They really feel like it wasn't the sport
they need to be in.</i>

17:21.666 --> 17:24.669
<i>So you demoralize a lot of the young men.</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:27.504
You got to show, put on a show
to make sure your rating's up.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.715
I understand that.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.634
But sometimes we just got to
take a step back and realize

17:31.718 --> 17:35.096
there's some heart and soul
on that field and...

17:35.930 --> 17:38.474
you got to look at the kids
that's playing the game.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.725
Both sides of the ball.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.607
[indistinct chatter]

17:46.566 --> 17:48.317
[girl] We win all the time in baseball.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.445
Getting my hair done, man,
before the game.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.824
- Getting ready to beat East Mississippi.
- Trying to get ready.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.242
You know what I'm trying to do.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.828
- Yeah, we gonna get that win. Big win.
- W.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.330
- They gonna be sad, sad faces.
- [all laugh]

18:01.413 --> 18:02.414
Lot of sad faces.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.584
[girl 2] CCC gonna whoop East Mississippi.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.794
We gonna whoop East Mississippi.
Ain't no secret.

18:06.878 --> 18:10.214
We gonna win. We gonna get this W.
The first W of the season.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.484
- We got my boy Brady here.
- [girl 2] Brady's starting.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.469
Gonna throw a lot of touchdown passes,
you know what I'm saying? [chuckles]

18:15.511 --> 18:17.471
My boy, Brady. Number 12.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.306
[all laughing]

18:29.025 --> 18:30.610
The big thing is what we talked about,

18:30.693 --> 18:31.986
and it's still the same thing.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.238
It's about taking care of us.
Handling our business.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.122
Don't drag. Don't go through the motions.
Get the most out of it today.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.595
Understand what you're working towards,
trying to be perfect.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.038
And finish up this season
in the North perfect.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.957
Got me? Any questions?
Bye. See you out there.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.003
[Buddy] We got good people here.
And we got good people that work for us.

18:49.086 --> 18:54.466
You know, hey, Jones tried to hire
our offensive coordinator, Marcus,

18:54.550 --> 18:57.011
<i>during the off-season,
and he chose to stay.</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:58.137
<i>And that's good.</i>

18:58.220 --> 19:02.350
If you wanna change your program,
come hire 'em. Pay 'em good money.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.226
They'll come change your program.

19:04.560 --> 19:09.065
[Wood] Right over left. Right over left.
Good stretch. Ready... Down!

19:09.982 --> 19:12.484
<i>I try to give 'em as much as I can
as far as...</i>

19:12.568 --> 19:14.755
<i>if there's something they need,
we're gonna try to meet 'em</i>

19:14.779 --> 19:17.073
<i>- and do things.</i>
- I really like that one, though.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.451
[Wood] It's gonna be a good lesson.
It's gonna be a good group.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.829
A lot of 'em may not have a lot
that they come from.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.498
Some do, some don't.
Uh, we just wanna make sure

19:25.581 --> 19:27.302
we're loving 'em all
and taking care of 'em.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.794
I mean, I don't know
about being necessarily a dad to 'em,

19:29.877 --> 19:32.421
but I do want to treat 'em
like I'd want somebody to treat mine.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.259
<i>I've got my sons.
I'm really, really fortunate.</i>

19:37.343 --> 19:38.720
<i>They're blessed. I have custody.</i>

19:38.803 --> 19:39.804
<i>It's been a great deal.</i>

19:39.887 --> 19:42.473
<i>We've grown a lot together over the years</i>

19:42.556 --> 19:45.727
<i>and I rely on them
probably more than they rely on me.</i>

19:45.810 --> 19:46.811
<i>So, been a good deal.</i>

19:48.062 --> 19:51.648
<i>I started this thing out
as a single dad back in 2008.</i>

19:52.274 --> 19:55.611
<i>There are some challenges. The hours
that you put in at night are different.</i>

19:55.695 --> 19:57.673
<i>Some nights you leave
at a decent hour, 8:00 or 9:00.</i>

19:57.697 --> 20:00.157
<i>Some nights you may leave later.</i>

20:00.241 --> 20:03.035
Sit down over top of the ball.
Work off of 'em now. Let's go.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.221
How you doing? How was school?

20:04.245 --> 20:05.246
- Good.
- That's good.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.457
<i>The great thing with me, they had
an opportunity to kinda be there with me.</i>

20:08.540 --> 20:10.667
<i>So, when we're at practice,
my kids are out there.</i>

20:10.752 --> 20:13.232
<i>When we were at games,
they'd travel with us. Different things.</i>

20:13.295 --> 20:16.590
<i>So the chance to raise my boys here
and not to have to push 'em away,</i>

20:16.673 --> 20:18.926
<i>they're pretty much around it
all the time.</i>

20:19.010 --> 20:21.512
Coach Stephens is good with it,
so that part's been a blessing.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.222
Buddy's been real good to me about that.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.891
Give me a Y. Give me a Z. Go.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.143
[Buddy] Seal the end!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.227
[Wood] <i>We're different.</i>

20:28.310 --> 20:30.271
<i>He tells me sometimes
I'm sugarcoating something</i>

20:30.354 --> 20:32.774
<i>and I tell him,
"You're fixing it with a shotgun."</i>

20:32.857 --> 20:34.900
<i>So, I mean, that's kinda how it goes.</i>

20:35.484 --> 20:37.085
<i>They named me the head-coach-in-waiting,</i>

20:37.111 --> 20:39.781
<i>which Coach Stephens
has been pushing for for a long time.</i>

20:39.864 --> 20:42.074
So, uh, maybe. Who knows?

20:42.158 --> 20:43.450
We'll see. Hope so.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.252
- [sighs] Man, what the fuck?
- [indistinct chatter]

20:54.461 --> 20:55.522
[Wagner] What are you trying to do?

20:55.546 --> 20:57.548
[Kam] I'm trying to log into my e-mail.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.929
- Okay. There you go.
- This is not my e-mail.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.264
That's your East Mississippi e-mail.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.100
I don't care about my East Mississippi,
I need my Gmail.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.227
- Oh, I don't have a thing to do with that.
- Mine.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.748
- [Dakota] Good morning.
- [Wagner] Hey.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.374
- [Dakota] How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.776
- I'm all right.
- Just all right?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.610
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.947
[Kam exhales heavily]

21:22.323 --> 21:24.658
[players laughing
and talking indistinctly]

21:29.621 --> 21:31.457
[loud thudding and laughter]

21:34.126 --> 21:38.130
- [Wagner] No fighting in my office.
- [Tim] They weren't fighting, they were...

21:38.214 --> 21:41.008
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Wagner shushes] Hey!

21:41.092 --> 21:42.735
- Listen to me, there are...
- I thought...

21:42.759 --> 21:44.136
[Wagner grunts] Be quiet!

21:44.220 --> 21:45.781
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [Wagner] Quiet.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.640
There are classes and offices
in this building.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.017
You are not gonna come in here

21:50.101 --> 21:52.436
and act like you are the only people
in this building.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.980
- [Tim speaking indistinctly]
- Tim!

21:54.063 --> 21:55.815
[players chuckle]

21:55.898 --> 21:57.817
[Tim] They already had their opportunity.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.360
[Wagner] <i>How old are we?</i>

21:59.443 --> 22:03.447
I feel like I should just go work
in a kindergarten.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.008
[Maleke] I like that.
That making me laugh.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.576
[Wagner] It's 10:54.
You have an eleven o'clock.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.871
- Hey, how you know?
- I know everything.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.415
[laughs]

22:16.585 --> 22:19.213
[Maleke] Are you smiling
to keep the frown away?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.923
Or are you just smiling for real?

22:21.715 --> 22:25.928
'Cause sometimes you would smile
just to cool yourself down from going off.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.681
[Wagner]
That's a very good observation, Maleke.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.226
[player] You got a nice little life,
Miss Wagner.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.897
You do.
You get to travel when you want to.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.791
- You just gotta...
- [player] Fine with the way your life is?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.360
[Maleke] The hardest part of your day,
you gotta deal with us.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.195
Am I fine with the way my life is?

22:43.279 --> 22:45.257
[player] You can live like this
the rest of your life.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.283
- Oh, no, no. Mm-mmm.
- [player] No? Whoa!

22:47.366 --> 22:49.887
I can't. I don't know that I can live
like this for three more months.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.496
- [player] Whoa! Wow.
- [laughs]

22:52.579 --> 22:53.830
Might not make it.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.132
[Miller] Gotta tell him, "Get up!"
I said, "I can't help you up either."

23:03.215 --> 23:04.883
[coaches laughing]

23:07.053 --> 23:09.721
- [Miller] I ain't no dog.
- I told Earnest... Earnest got up,

23:09.805 --> 23:11.765
I said, "Lay down,
let the defense breathe."

23:11.848 --> 23:13.017
[both laughing]

23:13.100 --> 23:15.144
- Let them breathe.
- Yeah. Oh, no, the funny one...

23:15.227 --> 23:16.395
The funny one are the frogs.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.106
Oh, no, come on, we had
a five-minute conversation on frogs.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.568
Watching the film,
I said, "Now, frog, anytime...

23:22.651 --> 23:24.611
if you think you hurt,
just fall down, son."

23:24.695 --> 23:26.447
[all laughing]

23:26.530 --> 23:30.034
The kids all trust that fact, right?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.204
- [whistle blows]
- [player laughing]

23:33.287 --> 23:35.348
When I go to the classroom
to ask the teachers about you

23:35.372 --> 23:36.415
and stuff like that,

23:36.498 --> 23:38.917
they say you acting a fool, man.
That's bad.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.461
That look bad on us.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.921
Now I'm looking to ask them
to help us out,

23:43.005 --> 23:45.382
give you extra work,
they ain't gonna wanna do it. Why?

23:45.466 --> 23:47.819
- 'Cause you wanna act a clown in class?
- I'll talk to him.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.154
You know which professor
I'm talking about?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.597
- Uh, Mr. Burr.
- Yeah, exactly.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.390
I did. I told him... I'll talk to him.

23:53.474 --> 23:56.893
- Okay. Did you apologize for your actions?
- I'll talk to him. Yes, sir.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.231
Okay, good. Good.
Act a fool again, I'm gonna act a fool.

24:00.314 --> 24:05.777
We don't have a Brittany on our staff
to help monitor and nurture

24:05.861 --> 24:07.238
the young players that we have.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.323
<i>Coach Lee filled the shoes of Brittany.</i>

24:10.032 --> 24:13.119
- Hey, Miller, you goin' to the library?
- [indistinct chatter]

24:13.202 --> 24:15.246
Give me that sheet like this
from the library.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.914
[Kentrell] Hey, Coach,
I need help with physical science.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.626
- I'm so serious. I ain't just playing.
- [chuckles]

24:20.709 --> 24:23.795
All right, man. I don't even know
what that old dude be talking about.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.881
I promise you. I be trying.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.259
First, get me a syllabus,
then I'll get you a tutor.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.178
[clicks tongue] Man, I don't even know
what he be talking about.

24:31.262 --> 24:34.473
Damn, we be having our assignments due.
I'm like, man...

24:35.641 --> 24:37.934
[sighs] It's hard out here
for a pimp, man.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.936
Yeah, this is my gap. That's your gap.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.664
- [player 1] Right.
- [player 2] They run that ball.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.939
[player 3] That's our zone.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.567
[players chattering excitedly]

24:49.113 --> 24:50.864
[Williams] Hey, y'all seen Kam?

24:51.365 --> 24:54.368
Hey, somebody go get Kam.
See if he in his room.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.621
All right, would you like
to run the draw out of this?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.625
Now he also would make sure...
He also...

25:01.917 --> 25:05.129
He also would take the ball down
and just start running with it.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.048
Okay?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.050
Stay intact.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.510
[players speaking indistinctly]

25:11.593 --> 25:13.387

25:13.470 --> 25:14.555

25:15.139 --> 25:17.683
[Williams] Kam, I can tell
how you stretch, you ain't ready.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.062
I had to come wake you up twice today.
You forgot your damn helmet.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.022
I feel like you finna have a bad day.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.274
[shouting and grunting]

25:26.442 --> 25:27.609
[Trickett] Good. Score!

25:27.693 --> 25:29.070
[whistle blowing]

25:29.153 --> 25:30.987
[Wood] Good job. Good job!

25:31.072 --> 25:34.783
Sideline team.
I guess we're not good enough to play.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.078
I don't play good enough.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.753
I start Thursday,
but I don't play good enough.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.502
[Williams] Right there. There you go!

25:45.586 --> 25:47.087
[player] Yeah! We got the ball.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.505
[Williams] Tim!

25:48.589 --> 25:51.049
He always do me like this.
Every week, bro.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.177
Monday, I'm on the bench.

25:53.802 --> 25:58.348
Thursday, I'm fucking starting.
That shit don't make no sense, Lil Bo.

25:58.432 --> 25:59.475
Hey, back up, Kam.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.437
There you go, get there, get there!

26:03.520 --> 26:06.440
Run to the ball!
Whoo! Look at that field, Ray!

26:06.523 --> 26:08.942
Look at that field, Ray. Get to the ball!

26:09.025 --> 26:10.777
Man, fuck!

26:10.861 --> 26:14.323
I'm trying to get some motherfuckin' reps,
but this shit fucking sucks.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.409
The days that I don't want reps,
he put me in every fucking play

26:17.493 --> 26:19.578
but the days that I want reps,
he never put me in.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.622
[player] You gotta want reps
every day, bro.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.789
Fuck that shit.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.711
Hey.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.631
- [Trickett] Open it. I wanna see it.
- Oh.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.317
[Trickett] That's the head coach.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.319
I will throw it at you.
I will slap you in the face with it

26:34.343 --> 26:35.703
- if I wanted to.
- Hey! [chuckles]

26:38.096 --> 26:41.016
"Isaiah, you can be
the difference maker for us."

26:44.060 --> 26:45.354
[player] Where you going?

26:47.356 --> 26:48.357
I don't know.

[Wagner] <i>These kids' futures</i>

27:14.258 --> 27:17.386
<i>maybe on the fact that we can play

27:17.469 --> 27:19.388
<i>The better your opponents get, you know,</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:22.057
the more those coaches
are out to look at you.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.352
I mean, last year,
we were all sitting around,

27:25.436 --> 27:29.231
twiddling our thumbs, wondering
when coaches were gonna come in.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.233
<i>And just the difference in this year,</i>

27:31.316 --> 27:34.570
<i>there's been a steady stream of coaches
coming in, looking at our guys.</i>

27:36.655 --> 27:38.532
[recruiter] <i>Is Chauncey</i>
<i>gonna graduate, Coach?</i>

27:38.615 --> 27:41.117
I think that a Power Five
will come in here and pick him up

27:41.202 --> 27:43.161
because of his skill set.
He can do everything.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.831
He can do so much.
Uh... but they haven't yet.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.793
[Ed Holly] <i>Tim Bonner is an edge rusher.</i>

27:49.876 --> 27:53.129
As far as pass rushing goes, Coach,
you won't find any better in the country.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.049
- [Wagner] I think he'll pass everything...
- Yeah, it's just...

27:56.132 --> 27:57.676
- and graduate.
- Yeah. Right.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.928
I think the issue could be the two-five.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.907
[Wilkerson] <i>He's been injured</i>
<i>this season.</i>

28:02.931 --> 28:04.225
Right. Okay.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.059
[Wilkerson] Hopefully, if we continue,

28:06.142 --> 28:08.019
he'll get bigger and bigger
and bigger offers,

28:08.103 --> 28:09.813
so... which is what we want for the kid.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.172
[recruiter] Let me ask
about the quarterback.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.532
- [Wagner] He will graduate in December.
- Okay. Oh, good.

28:20.616 --> 28:26.079
- He's a good student.
- Good. I'm just... Yeah.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.498
- I like him.
- Yeah.

28:27.581 --> 28:31.042
I have no issues with him.
I mean, I think he's mature.

28:31.126 --> 28:35.631
- I think he made a terrible mistake.
- Mm-hmm.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.799
And he's paid for it. And it's done.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.470
I mean,
he has not given me any indication...

28:41.553 --> 28:44.097
- Not one single day has he...
- Okay.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.392
It's like it's not even
the same person, to me.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.559
Like, I can't...

28:47.643 --> 28:50.729
The guy that I know didn't do that.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.274
[chuckles] I don't know what happened.
I don't wanna know.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.108
- Like, you know, I don't know...
- Right.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.070
But the guy that I know,
that sits in here every day...

28:58.404 --> 28:59.488
is not that guy.

29:00.281 --> 29:03.116
- It's good, it's good. It's really good.
- Yeah.

[Trickett] <i>I understand</i>

29:52.291 --> 29:55.461
everything, every news article
from the past will come back up

29:55.544 --> 29:57.963
and then, you know,
he goes somewhere else.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.799

you know, even offering the kid</i>

30:00.882 --> 30:02.050

to avoid that, which I get.</i>

30:04.219 --> 30:06.347
Um... but at the same time,

30:06.430 --> 30:08.432
if you want him, start showing some trust.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.393
So that's why people are kinda
talking to him a little quietly.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.521
Um... but we'll see,
we'll see how it plays out.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.526
A lot of schools don't really wanna
take a chance on me right now.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.320
But they don't know if I learned...

30:21.403 --> 30:24.072
They're not sure if I learned
from my mistake

30:24.155 --> 30:27.242
or if I have any legal troubles,
which I don't.

30:28.118 --> 30:32.080
See, I could play college football
at the highest level.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.809
I'm just not right now.
It's not even 'cause I'm not good enough.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.669
It's because I made a mistake,

30:37.919 --> 30:41.172
which cost me
for not being at the top right now.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.592
But it's all right

30:43.675 --> 30:47.888
because whichever school decides
to take a chance on me

30:47.971 --> 30:53.309
and bring me in, you know,
I feel that they wouldn't regret it.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.397
I feel that I would make
a great impact there.

Hey, you're plenty talented
to go beat their butt.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.808
Plenty talented. And you probably will.

40:35.891 --> 40:40.355
But when we misread a quarterback,
when we drop balls,

40:40.438 --> 40:43.358
when we're missing who to block,
that's just not thinking.

40:43.858 --> 40:48.029
Now, hey. You can come out here
and you can half-ass it all you want to

40:48.113 --> 40:50.406
and see what happens. See what happens.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.242
I've done this a long time.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.494
This is y'all's first trip
through this shit.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.912
Some of you may think
you know it all, but you don't.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.289
I don't know it all.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.707
But I know one thing.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.669
You half-ass prepare,
you will get jacked up in a ball game.

41:04.462 --> 41:08.674
And it'll make you look bad and it'll ruin
some scholarship opportunities for you.

41:09.217 --> 41:12.637
Think I'm messing around? Try me. Try me!

41:13.721 --> 41:17.558
Go ahead. Don't prepare yourself
and see what happens.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.396
Don't take nothing for granted.
Not anything.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.993
- [Brady] Y'all have ibuprofen?
- [nurse] Yes. Let me have a look.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.748
Here you go. Good luck.

42:20.288 --> 42:21.289
[Miller] <i>Listen up.</i>

42:21.372 --> 42:23.291
<i>You know what's out there?
East is out there.</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:25.626
We're accepting the challenge like always.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.337
People are going to say a lot of things.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.647
They're gonna say,
"They're gonna get blown out,

42:28.671 --> 42:29.797
gonna do this, do that."

42:29.880 --> 42:33.301
There's no reason for us to go out there
and not to perform the best way we can.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.304
All right? It don't matter
if it's the first quarter or the fourth,

42:36.387 --> 42:37.489
we're gonna give it all we got.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.865
- We always do, right?
- [all] Right.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.601
Always give it all we got.
And that's all we askin'.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.977
The coaches, staff, and myself,

42:43.061 --> 42:47.065
all we want you to do is give us
everything you got until that horn go off,

42:47.148 --> 42:48.908
then we'll let the chips fall
where they may.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.069
Got it? Let's go. Let's go have some fun.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.696
We got nothing to lose.
Let's go have some fun. Let's go.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.824
[Joey Zanaboni] <i>Well,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen, good evening</i>

42:56.907 --> 42:59.202
<i>and welcome
to Coahoma Community College Football.</i>

42:59.285 --> 43:01.871
<i>My name, Joey Zanaboni.
Right alongside me...</i>

43:01.954 --> 43:04.665
<i>Brian Fennelly about to get started
with East Mississippi,</i>

43:04.749 --> 43:06.470
<i>the number three ranked team
in the country.</i>

43:06.542 --> 43:10.045
[Crowder] <i>Good evening and welcome</i>
<i>inside Coahoma Tigers' stadium</i>

43:10.130 --> 43:14.467
<i>where it is a battle between EMCC,
ranked number three this week,</i>

43:14.550 --> 43:19.555
<i>taking on an unranked and winless
Coahoma Tiger team here in Clarksdale.</i>

43:19.639 --> 43:21.724
[Zanaboni] <i>East Mississippi</i>
<i>coming off a win</i>

43:21.807 --> 43:24.059
<i>against the number one team
in the country.</i>

43:24.144 --> 43:27.230
<i>If we can get this upset,
it would be absolutely monumental.</i>

43:27.313 --> 43:28.689
[Crowder] <i>They've played 40 times.</i>

43:28.773 --> 43:31.901
<i>Coahoma has only defeated EMCC one time...</i>

43:31.984 --> 43:34.237
Let's get real.
Hit squad on three. One, two, three...

43:34.320 --> 43:35.506
- [all] Hit squad!
- [coach] Let's go.

43:35.530 --> 43:38.658
[Crowder] <i>This is one of those games</i>
<i>that could be challenging mentally,</i>

43:38.741 --> 43:39.843
<i>because you're taking on a team</i>

43:39.867 --> 43:42.245
<i>that you should beat
in every statistical category.</i>

43:42.328 --> 43:44.455
[Winfield] <i>They haven't been good</i>
<i>on the offensive,</i>

43:44.539 --> 43:46.291
<i>haven't been good on the defensive side...</i>

43:46.374 --> 43:49.502
[Fennelly] <i>Just watching the new energy</i>
<i>that's coming in with Coach Miller.</i>

43:49.585 --> 43:53.839
<i>A bunch of guys that are so young,
starting to build something special.</i>

43:53.923 --> 43:56.426
[Crowder] <i>De'Andre Johnson,</i>
<i>offensive player of the year,</i>

43:56.509 --> 43:58.430
<i>rolls to his left
as he had some inside pressure.</i>

43:58.511 --> 44:00.822
[Zanaboni] <i>He's under pressure</i>
<i>from Hankins. He spins away,</i>

44:00.846 --> 44:03.183
<i>finds a receiver downfield
about the 30 of Coahoma.</i>

44:03.266 --> 44:04.868
[Crowder] <i>Tries to spin out of a tackle.</i>
<i>He does!</i>

44:04.892 --> 44:07.937
<i>At the 20, 10, 5... Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

44:08.020 --> 44:09.814
- [grunts]
- Come on!

44:09.897 --> 44:12.358
Touchdown! There you go, thank you!

44:12.442 --> 44:15.110
[Zanaboni] <i>How did he get away</i>
<i>from Antonio Nelson there?</i>

44:15.195 --> 44:16.446
<i>Just a very crafty move.</i>

44:16.529 --> 44:19.449
[coach] God damn, man!
Get your fucking feet!

44:19.532 --> 44:22.577
[Zanaboni] <i>East Mississippi</i>
<i>with a 60-yard scoring drive</i>

44:22.660 --> 44:24.662
<i>to get on the board first.</i>

44:24.745 --> 44:27.873
<i>But CCC with an opportunity
to strike back.</i>

44:27.957 --> 44:31.461
[Fennelly] <i>Brady Burse, the freshman</i>
<i>from Olive Branch High, under center.</i>

44:32.086 --> 44:35.381
<i>Burse, pressure coming and down he goes.</i>

44:35.465 --> 44:37.609
[Crowder] <i>Hit and sacked</i>
<i>in the backfield, inside the 20.</i>

44:37.633 --> 44:40.303
<i>Coming in is Rodney Jackson
to make a huge hit.</i>

44:40.386 --> 44:42.305
[Winfield] <i>A negative drive</i>
<i>to start the game.</i>

44:42.388 --> 44:44.557
We ain't gonna have time
to play action shit now.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.851
That motherfucker back there
before we got the snap.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.978
So we should have...
The jitters are gone, right?

44:49.061 --> 44:50.497
- [player] Yes, sir.
- [coach] All right. Guys,

44:50.521 --> 44:52.232
just run the assignment.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.567
They ain't got on
no fucking cape, all right?

44:54.650 --> 44:56.026
Ain't no capes on over there.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.911
- Yes, sir.
- They put their pants on like us.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.822
Keep playing. Defense, go get them off.

44:59.905 --> 45:01.324
Get ready. Let's go.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.784
They're gonna go fast
and try to get another one now.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.412
[Zanaboni] <i>Johnson really moving</i>
<i>this offense quite quickly.</i>

45:06.496 --> 45:08.914
<i>- Fires toward the 30.</i>
- Hey, watch out! We got him.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.124
[laughs]

45:10.207 --> 45:14.712
[Crowder] <i>Dropped. Oh, Daniel Crowell</i>
<i>looked downfield and just dropped it.</i>

45:14.795 --> 45:18.383
Get his ass out. Now. Now!
Jesus Christ.

45:18.466 --> 45:19.526
[Crowder] <i>Lions gonna bring up</i>

45:19.550 --> 45:21.403
<i>- a third down and long.</i>
- Right away, South 60!

45:21.427 --> 45:24.972
[Zanaboni] <i>Third and five here.</i>
<i>Be wonderful to send the Lions out.</i>

45:25.055 --> 45:29.184
<i>Three and out. Johnson dropping back,
he's under pressure...</i>

45:29.269 --> 45:30.978
Come on! Goddang!

45:31.061 --> 45:34.023
Why don't we not go
and block somebody? God!

45:34.106 --> 45:36.984
[Crowder] <i>So now EMCC's gonna</i>
<i>have to kick the football away.</i>

45:37.067 --> 45:40.154
- [Miller] Good job, good job, D.
- Get off the field! Let's go!

45:41.155 --> 45:42.740
[Miller] Good job. Hey, good job.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.867
[Zanaboni] <i>That's excellent work</i>
<i>by the CCC defense.</i>

45:44.950 --> 45:47.077
[Buddy] You gotta give them time to throw!

45:47.161 --> 45:49.414
Step your ass up inside and help somebody!

45:49.497 --> 45:51.332
[Crowder] <i>Offensively,</i>
<i>after that first drive,</i>

45:51.416 --> 45:52.917
<i>they've just had some hiccups.</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:55.881
[Buddy] Get your rear off the field.
Don't walk your ass around and pout,

45:55.961 --> 45:57.087
you understand?

45:57.171 --> 45:59.256
You gotta give him time.
He can't throw off his back.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.509
And you can't get beat on this move.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.303
He's not that good, I told you!

46:03.386 --> 46:05.262
Stay inside, make him beat you around.

46:05.346 --> 46:06.706
He can't beat you around the edge.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.391
He's not good enough.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.226
I feel like it's just like, "Mm-hmm."
You're all just, "Mm-hmm."

46:11.311 --> 46:13.771
Not fired up, and you sit there
and go, "Mm-hmm."

46:13.854 --> 46:14.939
But you don't do anything.

46:15.022 --> 46:17.525
Y'all all got this look of, like...

46:17.608 --> 46:19.652
[Wood] Play! Let's go play!
Next play. Let's go.

46:19.735 --> 46:20.778
Let's go!

46:20.861 --> 46:23.238
[sing-song] Let's go, offense, let's go!

46:23.323 --> 46:25.325
[Fennelly] <i>Pressure coming,</i>
<i>Burse eludes it.</i>

46:25.408 --> 46:29.370
<i>Henderson on him, flings.
This is Eric Moore.</i>

46:29.454 --> 46:34.750
<i>And he's able to pedal his way
to the 45-yard line for a first down.</i>

46:34.834 --> 46:35.835
Yeah! Yeah!

46:35.918 --> 46:36.919
Dadgummit! First down.

46:37.002 --> 46:39.213
[Crowder] <i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>starting to see confidence</i>

46:39.296 --> 46:41.131
<i>into this football team, on this drive.</i>

46:41.215 --> 46:43.634
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Make the tackle!

46:43.718 --> 46:46.136
For crying out loud,
pick the damn thing off!

46:46.220 --> 46:47.888
[Crowder] <i>Coahoma</i>
<i>finding some rhythm now.</i>

46:47.972 --> 46:49.849
<i>Burse is gonna take
a fade pattern near side</i>

46:49.932 --> 46:51.934
<i>and a one-handed grab.</i>

46:52.017 --> 46:55.938
[Zanaboni] <i>He comes up with a wonderful</i>
<i>one-handed catch. How about that?</i>

46:56.021 --> 46:58.358
Get inside! Come on, Daniel!

46:58.441 --> 47:00.192
[Crowder] <i>The second first down</i>
<i>for Coahoma.</i>

47:00.275 --> 47:02.476
[Zanaboni] <i>Burse, he's gonna hand</i>
<i>this one off. Hammond.</i>

47:02.528 --> 47:05.448
[Crowder] <i>And he goes up the middle,</i>
<i>breaks tackles, stays on his feet.</i>

47:05.531 --> 47:08.826
<i>Down the numbers and he's gonna be
spun down at the 20-yard line.</i>

47:08.909 --> 47:10.244
[Zanaboni] <i>And suddenly CCC</i>

47:10.327 --> 47:12.372
<i>- is knocking on the door...</i>
- [screams]

47:12.455 --> 47:14.874
It don't matter.
We playing the best team in the state.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.291
We gonna get at 'em. They go.

47:16.376 --> 47:18.961
It don't matter who it is. No matter.

47:19.044 --> 47:21.714
[Fennelly] <i>When you're looking at</i>
<i>the Coahoma sideline here, man,</i>

47:21.797 --> 47:22.840
<i>guys are pumped up.</i>

47:22.923 --> 47:25.342
<i>Yeah, you're down 14
but you're in this game.</i>

47:25.426 --> 47:28.638
We gotta punch one in.
Let's go, punch this one in, all right?

47:28.721 --> 47:30.681
[Zanaboni] <i>Fourth down.</i>
<i>Brian, do we go for it?</i>

47:30.765 --> 47:33.085
[Fennelly] <i>I think you do.</i>
<i>You take a shot at the end zone.</i>

47:33.142 --> 47:35.310
- Let's go, Rooh!
- [Fennelly] <i>Go for pay dirt...</i>

47:35.395 --> 47:38.063
[Zanaboni] <i>Pass here</i>
<i>from Burse but it's broken up.</i>

47:38.147 --> 47:39.524
[Crowder] <i>Batted down by EMCC.</i>

47:39.607 --> 47:41.316
- Yes!
- [stadium announcer] <i>Incomplete.</i>

47:41.401 --> 47:42.652

<i>And East Mississippi

47:50.493 --> 47:51.869
[Williams] Great job! Let's go!

47:51.952 --> 47:54.288
Look, man.
Let's get our swagger back, man.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.874

Let's just do it, man.

47:56.957 --> 48:00.420
Let's get off our ass. Let's move, man.
Everybody, man. Let's go, man.

Just wrap up and tackle.

Come on, man!
Man on man, man coverage.

48:22.608 --> 48:23.984
You gotta keep your feet and play.

[announcer 1] <i>One thing you can ill afford</i>

Yo, man. Just play ball, bro.
This ain't nothing new.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.382
So all you gotta do is play the pocket.

48:47.467 --> 48:50.302
Okay, you say that though,
but they can run up from the pocket, too.

48:50.385 --> 48:51.721
They gonna get pushed back.

48:51.804 --> 48:52.906
- Then there's no pocket.
- Yeah.

<i>That's a very good throw by Johnson.</i>

49:32.595 --> 49:34.680
where the guy lining up... [mumbles]

49:34.764 --> 49:36.641
It has to do with, we're not finishing.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.852
We're thinking that three steps
against this bunch is good enough.

49:39.935 --> 49:41.729
Nobody plays like we do.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.189
They just got a lot more
experience than we do, all right?

49:44.273 --> 49:47.067
We're up 28-nothing.
Doesn't mean there's bad things, okay?

49:47.151 --> 49:49.654
But you...
Hey. You gotta drive second half now.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.047
I wanna start off. Let's get one.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.699
I ain't proud because
we down by 24 and that's all.

49:53.783 --> 49:56.619
I'm proud because I know we playing
to our maximum potential.

49:56.702 --> 49:58.013
That's the best team in the nation.

49:58.037 --> 49:59.758
They're gonna win
the national championship.

49:59.830 --> 50:00.873
I promise you that.

50:00.956 --> 50:04.544
We playing the national champs,
and we playin' our asses off.

50:04.627 --> 50:08.047
We wanna show the world we can hang
with the best. That's all we wanna do.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.156
[Chauncey] Go, Snoop. Come on.
Get a tackle!

50:16.180 --> 50:17.181

<i>Johnson, talent-wise,</i>

50:34.489 --> 50:35.950

50:37.409 --> 50:38.452
<i>Three-yard touchdown run.</i>

50:38.535 --> 50:39.763
[Winfield] <i>You know what that does.</i>

50:39.787 --> 50:41.789
[Crowder] <i>That means</i>
<i>the clock begins to run.</i>

50:41.872 --> 50:44.592
- [Winfield] <i>The Buddy rule is in effect.</i>
- [Crowder] <i>It's in effect.</i>

50:45.250 --> 50:47.628

Until then, so long.</i>

51:00.725 --> 51:02.005
[Miller] <i>Good news and bad news.</i>

51:02.059 --> 51:03.560
You played your asses off, okay?

51:03.644 --> 51:05.980
You look at the score,
that's the bad news.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.065
Good news is, we got one more game, right?

51:08.148 --> 51:11.526
They haven't won, we haven't won, right?
Somebody gotta fucking win next week.

51:11.611 --> 51:13.331

I don't give a damn.
I don't give a damn what you say.

We got a chance to go out there

51:20.745 --> 51:23.706
and we gonna go out there and give it
every fucking thing we got next week.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.375
We gonna win that game,

51:26.458 --> 51:29.544

51:29.629 --> 51:31.088
