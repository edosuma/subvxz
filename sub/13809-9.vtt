AT LEAST IT'S PROGRESS.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.039
SOMEDAY THEY'RE GOING TO NAME
A BEEF AFTER YOU.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.791
COME ON, SQUID.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.313
(<i> kids shouting</i> )

12:11.397 --> 12:14.984
GO ON, MOVE,

12:34.336 --> 12:35.713

12:35.796 --> 12:38.132
THAT'S THE FOURTH
SCORE TODAY!

12:38.215 --> 12:39.008
THE OBJECT IS

12:39.091 --> 12:42.970
TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY,
SAMMY, REMEMBER?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.764
{\an1}HEY, HE MADE
THE SAVE.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.476
YOU CAN'T WIN A GAME
YOU DON'T FINISH.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.685
AND WE'LL
NEVER FINISH

12:49.768 --> 12:52.021
{\an1}IF THE SQUID KEEPS
LOSING THE BALL.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.522
FETCH, SQUID, FETCH.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.524
FINE! I'LL GO GET IT.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.650
(<i> groans</i> )

12:56.734 --> 12:58.903
THOSE GUYS THINK
THEY CAN ORDER ME AROUND.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.362
I MADE THE SAVE, DIDN'T IT?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.655
(<i> grunts</i> )

13:04.533 --> 13:06.327
{\an4}Sam:
HEY, ANYBODY SEE
A LOOSE BALL

13:06.410 --> 13:08.037
COME THROUGH HERE?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.455
{\an3}ASK HIM!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.042
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.129
{\an1}WHOA, THE FASTEST P.C.
IN THE WORLD.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.256
IT'S GOT...

13:19.340 --> 13:22.051
720 MEGAHERTZ, ONBOARD

13:22.134 --> 13:26.222
{\an5}Both:
AND UPGRADABLE, BACKWARD-

13:27.389 --> 13:29.683
{\an1}YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT COMPUTERS.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.684
I'M HELPING
MY BIOLOGY PROFESSOR

13:30.768 --> 13:33.604
{\an5}DESIGN A CATALOGUE
OF THE ENTIRE
ANIMAL KINGDOM.

13:33.687 --> 13:37.066
BIOLOGY? WHERE DO
YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.484
DIABLO CANYON HIGH.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.360
HIGH SCHOOL?

13:39.443 --> 13:40.194
BUT YOU'RE A KID.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.238
I'M ADVANCED.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.155
I'M IMPRESSED.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.240
{\an3}I'M SAM.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.076
OLIVER VAN ROSSAM.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.413
(<i> chuckling</i> )

13:51.497 --> 13:52.164
Boy:
YOU STINK.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.209
I KNOW WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE SENT A GEEK

13:55.292 --> 13:57.211
INTO A COMPUTER STORE.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.340
OH, 26 MINUTES TO LOW TIDE.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.133
WANT TO GO DOWN
TO THE TIDE POOL

14:03.217 --> 14:05.594
AND CATALOGUE INDIGENOUS

14:05.678 --> 14:09.098
CRAB HUNT-- COOL!

14:15.854 --> 14:17.022
LET'S GO.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.486
WE MAY NOT SEE
HIM FOR WEEKS.

14:22.570 --> 14:26.031
{\an1}YOU GUYS RANKED
ON HIM PRETTY HARD.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.157
WE WEREN'T RANKING.

14:27.241 --> 14:27.700
WE WERE BEING TOUGH.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.952
HOCKEY'S A TOUGH GAME.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.122
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT,
GET OUT OF THE STREET.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.498
GOOD ONE, TWIST.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.500
YOU'RE A REAL POET.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.254
{\an1}LET'S GIVE SAMMY
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.381
OKAY, BUT IF HE'S
NOT BACK SOON

14:42.464 --> 14:45.134
{\an5}WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO START PLAYING
WITHOUT HIM.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.886
{\an1}HOW CAN WE PLAY
WITHOUT A GOALIE?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.138
(<i> buzzes</i> )

14:53.475 --> 14:54.560
{\an1}WHOA, YOU DON'T
NORMALLY SEE

14:54.643 --> 14:56.645
{\an1}A CARAPACE PATTERN
LIKE THAT.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.024
HMM, IT'S
AN <i> L. POLYPHEMUS.</i>

15:00.107 --> 15:02.192
GOOD SPOTTING, SAM.

15:02.276 --> 15:06.697
THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF SPECIES
IN THIS TIDE POOL.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.574
LOOK OUT, OLIVER!

15:08.657 --> 15:09.950
{\an1}IT'S THE RARE
FLYING CONCH SHELL.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.495
(<i> shrieks</i> )

15:14.455 --> 15:15.998
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

15:16.081 --> 15:18.334
SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU'D CATCH IT.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.668
I REMEMBER ONCE...

15:19.752 --> 15:22.171
I'M NOT WEARING A...
A BASEBALL MITTEN!

15:22.254 --> 15:23.922
I'M A SCIENTIST!

15:24.006 --> 15:25.549
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.884
STILL FRIENDS?

15:28.469 --> 15:32.306
YES, YES. ALL RIGHT.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.726
(<i> all laugh</i> )

15:38.646 --> 15:40.481
{\an1}I THINK
THE SQUID DITCHED US.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.484
IF HE DOESN'T
COME BACK SOON

15:43.567 --> 15:45.444
WE'LL HAVE TO FORFEIT
THE GAME.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.529
WE COULD PLAY MAN-DOWN.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.657
WHO'S WITH ME?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.331
(<i> yelps, groans</i> )

15:57.414 --> 15:59.541
MAYBE WE SHOULD FORFEIT.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.878
THAT ROCKED.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.380
IT'S GREAT TO GO EXPLORING

16:04.463 --> 16:06.548
WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
MARINE ECOSYSTEMS.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.133
USUALLY I DO
THINGS ALONE.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.010
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
AN ASSOCIATE.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.930
NO PROBLEMO, I KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE THE ODD MAN OUT.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.598
MY FRIENDS CALL ME THE SQUID.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.683
IN MY OPINION YOU
BEAR NO RESEMBLANCE

16:15.766 --> 16:18.394
TO ANY GENUS
OF CEPHALOPOD.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.688
UM, IT'S GETTING LATE.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.897
I'VE GOT TO SPLIT.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.650
I ALSO HAVE TO HEAD HOME
TO CATALOGUE THIS DATA.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.442
{\an1}HOP ON; I'LL
GIVE YOU A LIFT.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.777
I HAVE AN EXTRA HELMET.

16:26.860 --> 16:30.656
ONE PERSON ON A BIKE
IS UNSAFE ENOUGH, SAM.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.157
TWO? THAT'S MADNESS.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.868
OLIVER, DON'T YOU PLAY
ANY SPORTS?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.245
BUT OF COURSE.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.248
I'M THE YOUNGEST CHESS
GRAND MASTER IN THREE COUNTIES.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.333
OH.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.793
(<i> chuckles</i> )

16:49.675 --> 16:52.344
WE DON'T NEED
A NEW GOALIE.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.887
SAM WILL COME BACK.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.389
WHAT IF HE BLOWS US
OFF AGAIN?

16:55.472 --> 16:58.100
TWISTER'S RIGHT.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.601
LET'S DO THIS.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.311
OKAY, TELL US.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
WHY SHOULD YOU BE
OUR GOALIE?

17:03.147 --> 17:05.983
(<i> squeakily</i> ):
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF

17:06.066 --> 17:07.776
AS A PLAYER WITH VISION.

NEXT.

NAME'S MACK.

17:19.954 --> 17:20.998

17:21.080 --> 17:23.751
I EAT KIDS LIKE YOU
FOR BREAKFAST!

17:23.834 --> 17:25.461
I'LL PLAY GOALIE, DEFENSE

17:25.544 --> 17:28.714
THEN I'LL CARRY YOU HOME
TO YOUR MOMMIES ON MY BACK!

17:28.797 --> 17:31.300
(<i> growling</i> )

17:32.384 --> 17:35.637
{\an1}THANKS
BUT NO, THANKS.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.683
{\an4}WE'LL NEVER FIND
A GOALIE.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.350
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.852
JUST PICK SOMEONE.

17:41.935 --> 17:46.106
THESE GEEKS MAKE
EVEN THE SQUID LOOK GOOD.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.650
MAN, I WISH SAM WAS HERE.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.618
HERE WE GO.

17:57.701 --> 18:01.371

18:01.455 --> 18:03.582
WHAT A COOL COMPUTER!

18:03.665 --> 18:05.375
I BET YOU HAVE GREAT GAMES.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.545
{\an4}I WOULDN'T WASTE
TIME OR DRIVE SPACE
ON SUCH FRIVOLITIES.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.590
I BUILT IT MYSELF.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.341
IMPRESSIVE.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.510
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
THAT'S NOTHING.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.011
CHECK OUT
THIS CATALOGUE.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.557
OLIVER, THAT'S AWESOME.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.018
{\an5}BUT DON'T YOU EVER
WANT TO SKATE
DOWN THE BEACH

18:23.101 --> 18:23.644
WITH A BUNCH
OF OTHER KIDS?

18:23.727 --> 18:26.563
OR LEARN TO SURF?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.440
(<i> laughing</i> ):
YOU'RE SUCH A KIDDER.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.776
YOU REALLY HAD ME GOING THERE
FOR A SECOND.

18:30.859 --> 18:31.693
OH, MY GOSH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.070

18:35.739 --> 18:37.866

18:37.950 --> 18:40.244
OKAY, MAYBE THEY'VE
GOT THE LATEST ISSUE

{\an1}THERE'S THAT LIVELY
SENSE OF HUMOR AGAIN.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.919
{\an5}YOU MUST KEEP
YOUR OTHER FRIENDS
IN STITCHES.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.382
I WONDER WHAT
THE GUYS ARE DOING NOW.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.981
{\an1}WOULD YOU AT LEAST
SWING AT IT

19:09.064 --> 19:11.191
YOU BIG ZOMBIE?!

19:11.275 --> 19:13.235
(<i> bellows</i> ):
FOR THE LAST TIME

19:13.318 --> 19:14.987
I AM NOT THE WALKING DEAD.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.739
I AM EDDIE,
PRINCE OF THE NETHERWORLD!

19:17.823 --> 19:20.117
{\an1}YOU'RE SURE NOT BEING
A GOAL TENDIE.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.078
YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS MOCKERY!

I'M TELLING MY MOM!

19:26.707 --> 19:29.626
I MISS SAM.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.629
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I THINK I DO, TOO.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.257
{\an1}IT'S <i> YOUR</i> FAULT

19:35.340 --> 19:37.134
ME? DUDE,
YOU WERE THE ONE

19:37.217 --> 19:38.093
THAT ROYALLY DISSED HIM.

19:38.176 --> 19:41.221
YOU GUYS ALWAYS HAVE
TO BUST ON SOMEONE.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.681
LOOK AT YOU!

19:42.764 --> 19:43.974
WITH SAM
GONE

19:44.057 --> 19:45.809

TWISTER'S FAULT.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.402
WHAT?!

19:58.030 --> 20:01.408
THE DUNG BEETLE IS THE MOST
FASCINATING OF THE COLEOPTERA.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.951
ITS ADAPTIVE
BEHAVIOR IS...

20:03.035 --> 20:04.786
{\an1}YOU KNOW, IT'S A PRETTY
NICE DAY, OLIVER.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.496
{\an1}WHY DON'T WE
HIT THE BEACH?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.665
AAH, COME ON.

UM, NOTHING.

WHAT IT'S LIKE

22:07.909 --> 22:09.953
TO BE DUMPED
FOR THE DAY.

22:10.037 --> 22:10.912
YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM THERE.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.915

22:23.091 --> 22:26.219
{\an1}SO, OLIVER...
EVER PLAY HOCKEY?

22:26.303 --> 22:29.431
HOCKEY? I DON'T FLOSS
EIGHT TIMES A DAY

22:29.514 --> 22:31.516
JUST TO HAVE MY TEETH
KNOCKED OUT.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.061
WE WON'T KNOCK YOUR
TEETH OUT... TODAY.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.104

OH!

DO I PLAY?

22:40.859 --> 22:41.943

SCOREKEEPER.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.490

22:46.573 --> 22:49.117
I CAN DO IT IN BASE EIGHT
IF YOU WANT.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.620
MAYBE I SHOULD STOP OFF
AND GET MY SLIDE RULE.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.538
I CAN BE TIMEKEEPER,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.956
