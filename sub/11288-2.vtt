WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:04.070
There you go. Take a look.

00:04.137 --> 00:06.039
Oh, it's perfect, Obie.

00:06.106 --> 00:09.009
Oh, there's only one perfect
thing in my world, mama.

00:09.075 --> 00:10.777
Well, lay your lips
on it, daddy.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.445
Mmm.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.752
Well, if the brown stones are
rockin', don't come in knockin'.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.423
Hi, Kyle. We're celebrating
the new labels on the mailboxes.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.993
The future
Mrs. Overton Wakefield Jones.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.762
‐ Yeah.
‐ That's right.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.864
Look at how we changed Obie's.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.700
The future
Mr. Overton Wakefield Jones.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.968
'Okay.'

00:35.035 --> 00:37.137
You know, you two
have single‐handedly restored

00:37.203 --> 00:38.705
my faith in monogamy.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.707
Umm, thinkin'
about settling down?

00:40.774 --> 00:43.443
I said restored my faith,
not scramble my brain.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.515
‐ Oh, dear Lord.
‐ What's wrong, Kyle?

00:48.582 --> 00:50.450
My driver's license picture,
it's, it's...

00:50.517 --> 00:52.452
Oh, it's an abomination.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.221
Stop trippin', Kyle.

00:55.288 --> 00:58.224
Nobody takes a good
driver's license photo.

00:59.092 --> 01:01.367
[laughs]

01:01.434 --> 01:03.837
Well, let me see,
let me see, let me see.

01:03.904 --> 01:05.171
Come on now.

01:06.607 --> 01:09.242
Oh. Oh, it's not that bad.

01:09.308 --> 01:12.345
I mean, except for that silly,
little hat that you're wearing.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.681
‐ That is my hair.
‐ Oh.

01:14.748 --> 01:16.249
‐ That's not your hair.
‐ He got hair.

Now as Overton's best friend
and I presume best man

01:53.019 --> 01:55.856
I have taken the liberty of
writing down an impromptu toast.

01:55.922 --> 01:57.157
[clears throat]

01:57.223 --> 01:59.626
There are 32 keys
to a successful marriage

01:59.693 --> 02:01.902
and we'll take them
one at a time, but before I do‐‐

02:01.968 --> 02:04.270
Ah, ah, ah,
to Overton and Synclaire.

02:04.337 --> 02:06.840
‐ Get up.
‐ 'Yeah, you got it.'

02:06.907 --> 02:09.042
[indistinct chatter]

02:09.109 --> 02:11.512
Okay, you two,
now I have for you

02:11.578 --> 02:13.780
a very special engagement gift.

02:13.847 --> 02:17.350
I volunteered to apply
my taste and style

02:17.416 --> 02:18.484
to help make your wedding

02:18.552 --> 02:20.587
the fabulous event
of your dreams.

02:23.456 --> 02:25.025
Have you set a date yet?

02:25.091 --> 02:27.594
Well, we were plannin' on fall.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.896
Oh, unh‐unh,
fall colors don't suit me.

02:29.963 --> 02:31.497
I think spring.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.168
I bet the James' and the Jones'
are dustin' off

02:35.235 --> 02:37.170
their powder‐blue tuxes
right about now.

02:38.739 --> 02:41.474
Well, they, uh, haven't
found out just yet.

02:42.242 --> 02:43.544
What? Why not?

02:43.610 --> 02:45.979
Well, there's a tradition
in my family

02:46.046 --> 02:47.948
that every engagement
has to be approved

02:48.014 --> 02:49.816
by our great‐aunt Ada

02:49.883 --> 02:53.086
and we're not allowed
to tell anyone in either family

02:53.153 --> 02:55.288
until she gives
the official <i>okey‐dokie.</i>

02:57.758 --> 02:59.492
Hey, people.
What are we celebrating?

02:59.560 --> 03:01.502
Kyle get a vasectomy?

03:04.571 --> 03:08.241
How did you manage to climb out
of your jar of formaldehyde?

03:12.579 --> 03:14.447
Obie and I just got engaged.

03:14.515 --> 03:17.417
Oh, alright.
Well, congratulations.

03:17.483 --> 03:19.786
Okay, I guess,
uh, presents are in order.

03:24.024 --> 03:25.959
Here you go,
ride the maverick.

03:27.227 --> 03:29.162
Ride the maverick. Alright.

03:30.564 --> 03:32.899
Well, uh, I guess
we can scratch this one

03:32.966 --> 03:34.935
off the bridal registry.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.102
Yeah, yeah, don't thank me now.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.804
I just ask that
you invite me to your wedding.

03:37.871 --> 03:39.906
[chuckles]
I'm sure
they were planning on it.

03:39.973 --> 03:42.843
Every bride needs something
old and much borrowed.

03:49.616 --> 03:50.951
Come on, Obie,
let's call Aunt Ada.

03:51.017 --> 03:52.653
Hey, Kyle, you know what?

03:52.719 --> 03:54.054
You can listen
on the other extension

03:54.120 --> 03:56.056
and be our official witness.

03:57.658 --> 03:59.826
My ear throbs with anticipation.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.336
Khadijah, can you believe

04:03.403 --> 04:05.839
the TV coverage
my press conference got?

04:05.906 --> 04:07.407
They put me on before the guy

04:07.473 --> 04:09.409
who got mauled
by the panda bear.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.477
I'm hot.

04:11.545 --> 04:13.479
Well, look,
while you're still a nobody

04:13.547 --> 04:14.915
would you mind sitting down
for an interview?

04:14.981 --> 04:16.916
"Flavor's" doing
an election issue.

04:16.983 --> 04:19.351
Oh, hey, Max, good news, girl.

04:19.418 --> 04:22.523
I have decided to become
your campaign manager again.

04:22.589 --> 04:24.525
What's the good news?

04:27.160 --> 04:30.330
Because my society sisters
from ELBOW

04:30.396 --> 04:33.099
have decided to re‐endorse you
as their candidate.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.101
What's the good news?

04:36.469 --> 04:39.205
Which means I'll bring
chips and juice boxes

04:39.272 --> 04:40.306
to every rally.

04:40.373 --> 04:42.308
Hey. Hot damn, good news.

04:44.878 --> 04:48.114
Come on. Aunt Ada's
in the bathroom again?

04:48.181 --> 04:50.917
Every time I call,
she's in there.

04:50.984 --> 04:53.820
Well, does she have to watch
all of the 2000 flushes?

04:56.389 --> 04:57.558
Bye.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.268
Uh, Overton?

05:02.335 --> 05:06.306
I have a sinking feeling
I made a small blunder.

05:06.372 --> 05:09.375
Well, those socks are ugly,
but, eh, they go with the suit.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.012
What's goin' on, Kyle?

05:12.078 --> 05:14.881
Um, well, your‐your parents
called a few moments ago

05:14.948 --> 05:16.883
and you're gonna think
this is funny.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.553
Um, without thinking,
I kinda congratulated them

05:19.620 --> 05:21.154
on their son's engagement.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.056
[gasps]

05:23.123 --> 05:26.860
And then your‐your dad said
something about his son

05:26.927 --> 05:29.029
not having the decency
to tell his parents

05:29.095 --> 05:30.063
about his own engagement.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.565
Then here's the funny part.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.900
[laughs]
Y‐your mom burst into tears.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.938
Well, ain't that a hole
in the boat?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.075
Absolutely.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.810
Come on, Synclaire,
let's go make peace

05:43.877 --> 05:45.812
with my folks. Come on.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.283
Oh, I feel awful.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.353
Yeah, me too.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.957
But one of us does have
the power to uplift a friend.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.834
Kyle, let me see
that driver's license picture!

06:03.737 --> 06:06.239
‐ 'Number 79?'
‐ Oh, finally.

06:06.306 --> 06:08.374
Um, look, I'd like to get
a new driver's license.

06:08.441 --> 06:10.276
[laughs]

06:12.212 --> 06:14.548
As if your face
is a Kodak moment.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.719
Well, I, I'm so sorry, sir

06:18.785 --> 06:20.453
but we cannot replace a license

06:20.521 --> 06:23.156
unless it's been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.397
Oh, clumsy me.

06:33.099 --> 06:34.935
Oh, well, accidents do happen.

06:35.001 --> 06:36.737
Yeah, why don't you go ahead and
stand in front of the camera?

06:36.803 --> 06:37.804
‐ Yeah, right over there.
‐ Okay, mm‐hmm.

06:37.871 --> 06:39.706
Okay.

06:39.773 --> 06:41.708
‐ Uh, just a second.
‐ 'Okay.'

06:45.579 --> 06:47.748
Gesundheit. Number 80.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.918
I just.. I just..

06:53.419 --> 06:55.622
Alright, chill, bro,
chill, chill.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.467
Okay, Khadijah,
let's do this Q and A.

07:01.535 --> 07:03.436
I'm speaking at a nursing home
and I wanna get their votes

07:03.504 --> 07:05.438
before their medication
kicks in.

07:07.407 --> 07:08.709
‐ Here we go.
‐ Mm.

07:08.775 --> 07:11.177
Now one of the biggest problems
in the school district

07:11.244 --> 07:12.879
is speeding in the school zone.

07:12.946 --> 07:15.516
Now I ask alderman
what would you do about it?

07:15.582 --> 07:17.551
Children are not speed bumps.

07:24.024 --> 07:25.025
And?

07:25.091 --> 07:26.727
And I'm ready
for the next question.

07:26.793 --> 07:29.362
Alright, go. Come on. Let's go.

07:29.429 --> 07:31.665
‐ Okay. Graffiti.
‐ Mm.

07:31.732 --> 07:33.767
Now your opponent Malaba
favors an increase

07:33.834 --> 07:34.968
in police patrols.

07:35.035 --> 07:36.703
Well, see, that could lead
to higher taxes.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.104
Now what would you propose?

07:38.171 --> 07:40.473
I say it's time
to win back our walls.

07:45.979 --> 07:47.213
How?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.215
Dedication, perseverance

07:49.282 --> 07:51.985
and a word
I'm not afraid to say, sweat.

07:54.054 --> 07:56.590
You know, Max, w‐when you answer
these questions

07:56.657 --> 07:58.324
it's okay
to actually say something.

07:58.391 --> 08:00.226
Well, Khadijah, look,
look, that's my secret.

08:00.293 --> 08:02.636
I mean,
my press conference proved

08:02.703 --> 08:04.705
I know how to talk
to the voters.

08:04.771 --> 08:06.239
I mean, what you say
isn't nearly

08:06.306 --> 08:07.908
as important as the rhythm.

08:07.974 --> 08:09.810
Bam, blam, karbem

08:09.876 --> 08:11.411
dingiddy‐dingiddy‐dong.

08:12.913 --> 08:14.147
Next question!

08:16.817 --> 08:18.952
‐ Crime?
‐ Not on my street.

08:24.390 --> 08:27.528
‐ Education?
‐ Books are silent friends.

08:29.796 --> 08:31.865
‐ Employment?
‐ Work works.

08:35.235 --> 08:38.438
Max, would you for once just
speak in complete sentences?

08:43.009 --> 08:46.680
Complete sentences
for every criminal, yeah!

08:52.786 --> 08:55.155
Hey, Synclaire.
You talked to Aunt Ada yet?

08:55.221 --> 08:58.759
No, but this just came
in the mail from my mom.

08:58.825 --> 09:01.668
"Congratulations
on your engagement."

09:01.735 --> 09:02.869
I guess she must've found out

09:02.936 --> 09:04.304
but she seems
to be okay with it.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.106
‐ Mm.
‐ Aww.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.075
Um, you might wanna
check out the other side.

09:10.276 --> 09:12.212
"I have no daughter."

09:13.680 --> 09:15.248
But‐but how,
how did she find out?

09:15.315 --> 09:16.550
The only people
who know are us.

09:16.617 --> 09:17.784
Regine, heel!

09:23.189 --> 09:27.493
Okay, maybe I,
I mentioned something

09:27.561 --> 09:31.197
to my mother who,
who probably told your mother

09:31.264 --> 09:33.266
who probably then told
Synclaire's mother.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.835
God, th‐th‐those women

09:34.901 --> 09:36.870
jus‐just blabbermouths.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.576
Well, isn't this just peachy?

09:42.643 --> 09:44.678
Both our families
are about to disown us now.

09:44.745 --> 09:47.981
‐ You guys, I'm really sorry‐‐
‐ Sss.

09:48.048 --> 09:50.717
You know something, Regine.

09:50.784 --> 09:52.418
If I could embroider

09:52.485 --> 09:55.355
you'd be getting a pretty
nasty pillow from me.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.991
Ah!

10:00.293 --> 10:02.335
You can't keep your mouth
shut for two days?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.640
Hello, have we met?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.911
‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey.
‐ Oh, Max, good news.

10:10.977 --> 10:14.014
You are neck and neck
with Malaba in the polls.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.617
But more importantly,
the ELBOWs are talking

10:16.683 --> 10:18.084
about making me their treasurer.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.086
I don't give a frog's fat ass.
Alright, listen.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.590
Khadijah, when does
your endorsement come out?

10:23.657 --> 10:24.691
I gotta pull some quotes
from it.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.927
I just rented a billboard
on wheels.

10:26.993 --> 10:27.961
Oh, yeah.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.029
Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.931
Max, you better get
your money back.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.634
‐ What are you talking about?
‐ I endorsed another candidate.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.336
What?

10:39.372 --> 10:41.007
You just couldn't
stand to see me

10:41.074 --> 10:43.744
become treasurer of the ELBOWs,
now could you?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.853
Alright, this is a joke, right?

10:52.919 --> 10:54.721
I mean, you just,
you didn't really

10:54.788 --> 10:56.823
endorse Paul Malaba over me?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.526
‐ Of course not.
‐ Phew.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.668
‐ I endorsed William Perez.
‐ What?

11:01.735 --> 11:04.605
The high school teacher?
He's last in the polls.

11:04.671 --> 11:06.973
He's even behind the candidate
who died last week.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.475
Alright. Come on, Maxine.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.177
Now, Khadijah,
you obviously have not

11:11.244 --> 11:13.413
taken a good look at Perez.

11:13.479 --> 11:16.883
He has bad hair,
wears way too much corduroy

11:16.950 --> 11:20.253
and let me just say,
somebody needs a nose tweezer.

11:22.589 --> 11:26.026
Look, Max, you don't know
how hard this was for me

11:26.092 --> 11:28.529
but I have a responsibility
to my readers

11:28.595 --> 11:30.396
to endorse the best candidate.

11:30.463 --> 11:32.699
Now you keep doing this,
spouting these tired cliches.

11:32.766 --> 11:34.768
Hey, the proof
is in the pudding.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.639
Now look, hold up here.

11:38.705 --> 11:40.641
Let's‐let's just deal
with the real.

11:42.042 --> 11:44.645
This is about you and me

11:44.711 --> 11:47.881
and a little thing
called jealousy.

11:49.983 --> 11:52.653
What the devil
are you talking about?

11:52.719 --> 11:53.754
Well, see, up until now

11:53.820 --> 11:54.921
you've been
the self‐appointed leader

11:54.988 --> 11:56.422
of our little foursome.

11:56.489 --> 11:58.158
The great provider.

12:00.527 --> 12:03.169
Synclaire needs a job,
worked for Khadijah.

12:03.236 --> 12:06.172
Regine needs a place to live,
lived with Khadijah.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.408
Suddenly I'm on the verge
of winning this election

12:08.474 --> 12:10.443
without any help from you

12:10.511 --> 12:12.679
and mother cannot stand
to share the spotlight

12:12.746 --> 12:14.781
can you?

12:14.848 --> 12:17.784
[stutters]

12:22.288 --> 12:24.457
You know, Max,
I stand corrected.

12:24.525 --> 12:27.127
Here I was thinking you weren't
ready for public office.

12:27.193 --> 12:28.662
‐ But you are shady.
‐ 'Oh!'

12:28.729 --> 12:30.463
‐ Trifling.
‐ 'Huh?'

12:30.531 --> 12:31.732
And you spit more garbage

12:31.798 --> 12:33.800
than any politician
I ever heard.

12:36.469 --> 12:37.704
Why‐why thank you, Khadijah.

12:39.272 --> 12:41.274
But you know,
it's too late to endorse me now.

12:45.278 --> 12:48.582
‐ Hey, Overton.
‐ Hey, Kyle.

12:48.649 --> 12:50.984
Do I get a chance to see
your new driver's license photo?

12:54.387 --> 12:55.789
Gesundheit, Kyle.

12:57.791 --> 13:00.166
Pardon my French but <i>Notre Dame.</i>

13:02.769 --> 13:05.338
I still can't
get through to Aunt Ada.

13:05.405 --> 13:07.240
After three days, that's it.

13:07.307 --> 13:09.976
You know, I'm tired of your
family's foolish tradition.

13:10.043 --> 13:12.445
Who's calling
whose family foolish?

13:12.513 --> 13:14.114
What about yours?

13:14.180 --> 13:16.650
[imitates Overton]

always say..

13:18.218 --> 13:20.320
"Surprised you kind of grew him
over the threshold.

13:20.386 --> 13:22.556
Hey, he didn't wanna
pay for the house."

13:27.528 --> 13:29.495
Don't crack
on Uncle Smoke Eye, girl.

13:29.563 --> 13:32.165
‐ I'm cracking on you.
‐ Look at you, woman.

13:32.232 --> 13:33.600

13:38.805 --> 13:40.774
Back it up.

13:40.841 --> 13:42.743
Alright, just chill out.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.878
Now over the past
couple of months, right

13:44.945 --> 13:46.212
you two have made commitment

13:46.279 --> 13:48.448
seem like almost
a good idea, huh?

13:48.515 --> 13:51.351
So come on, don't let
your families make you forget

13:51.417 --> 13:54.154
whose special time this is.

13:54.220 --> 13:55.689
‐ I'm sorry, Obie.
‐ Me too, sweet pea.

13:55.756 --> 13:56.890
Okay.

13:58.358 --> 13:59.492
Thank you.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.167
It's just, I can't believe
that our relatives

14:01.234 --> 14:03.469
can't share in our joy.

14:03.537 --> 14:05.405
And nothing's gonna
pick up my spirits.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.108
Um, Kyle?

14:12.178 --> 14:13.379
Thanks, brother.

14:13.446 --> 14:15.381
[laughs]

14:17.217 --> 14:20.120
Maxine Shaw,
ride the maverick.

14:20.186 --> 14:21.221
Alright.

14:23.389 --> 14:25.526
Knight to queen three,
checkmate.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.260
Alright.

14:27.327 --> 14:28.962
Ah, Miss Shaw.

14:29.029 --> 14:30.564
I'm William Perez,
your opponent.

14:30.631 --> 14:31.765
My pleasure to meet you.

14:31.832 --> 14:33.299
Yeah, beat it, Perez.
I got here first.

14:33.366 --> 14:35.736
Oh, I'm not here
looking for votes.

14:35.802 --> 14:37.771
My civics class and I
come out here once a week

14:37.838 --> 14:40.306
to scrub over the artwork.

14:40.373 --> 14:41.975
Besides, the last thing
I wanna do is

14:42.042 --> 14:45.011
to shatter this peace and quiet
with election nearing.

14:46.012 --> 14:48.181
Ride the maverick!

14:48.248 --> 14:50.884
A vote for Shaw
is a vote for the law.

14:52.285 --> 14:54.621
Watch "Palo Alto"
weekdays at 1:00.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.258
Hey, man, you know
the election's tomorrow

14:58.324 --> 15:00.727
and you're out here
whitewashing graffiti.

15:00.794 --> 15:02.936
I mean, there may be a reason
why the press refers to you

15:03.003 --> 15:04.137
as who?

15:06.139 --> 15:10.076
Hey, just because I lose doesn't
mean I can't affect the change.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.445
Couple of years ago,
this park was a vacant lot.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.748
Fifty drug deals at night.

15:14.815 --> 15:16.917
I made cleaning it up
an issue in my campaign

15:16.983 --> 15:20.486
so Malaba was forced
to make an issue of it too.

15:20.554 --> 15:23.890
When he won,
he had to clean it up.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.792
Oh, I may have lost the election

15:25.859 --> 15:28.562
but I won this park
for my neighborhood.

15:28.629 --> 15:31.297
Why are you running?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.967
I want to piss off a friend.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.037
Well, you know, I guess
I wanted to make a difference.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.304
How?

15:39.372 --> 15:42.142
You know,
fight the good fight.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.010
Go for the gold.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.412
Reach out and touch someone.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.715
Be all I can be,
ugh, whatever.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.118
Well, Miss Shaw,
have it your way.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.357
Good luck.

Whoo!

16:08.074 --> 16:11.745
And now it's time to meet
our next alderman.

16:11.812 --> 16:16.316
When she says ride the maverick,
she means it.

16:16.382 --> 16:17.417
Maxine Shaw.

16:17.483 --> 16:19.419
[all cheering]

16:22.723 --> 16:25.859
(Max)
Thank you, Regine.
Thank you, thank you.

16:25.926 --> 16:29.162
As you know, I've run
on a platform of honesty

16:29.229 --> 16:31.264
So I can honestly tell you
that there is someone

16:31.331 --> 16:33.867
better for the job.

16:33.934 --> 16:35.702
And to help get him elected

16:35.769 --> 16:37.571
I am dropping out the race.

16:37.638 --> 16:39.506
‐ What?
‐ Drop out?

16:39.573 --> 16:41.074
So tomorrow

16:41.141 --> 16:44.277
check the box
marked William Perez.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.979
I know I will.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.048
I'll be happy to answer
any questions.

16:50.784 --> 16:52.886
Well, I have one.

16:52.953 --> 16:55.355
Do you know how much I hate you?

16:58.324 --> 17:00.266
[reporters clamoring]

17:02.869 --> 17:06.372
I demand an acceptable
driver's license picture.

17:06.439 --> 17:07.641
I have a right not to be

17:07.708 --> 17:09.542
photographically abused
by my government.

17:09.609 --> 17:12.377
Do you see this creature
anywhere in this room?

17:12.444 --> 17:14.580
This is degrading.
It's immortalizing.

17:14.647 --> 17:16.583
It is just so..

17:22.088 --> 17:24.625
W‐w‐w‐what the hell was that?

17:26.392 --> 17:28.493
I just couldn't take it anymore.

17:28.561 --> 17:30.931
Oh, I purposely took
the unflattering photo of you

17:30.997 --> 17:32.833
just hoping you'd be back.

17:32.899 --> 17:37.838
[chuckles]
I feel a strange combination
of flattery and fear.

17:40.206 --> 17:43.243
You're a beautiful man,
Kyle Barker

17:43.309 --> 17:45.612
but I'm sure you hear that
all the time.

17:45.679 --> 17:47.614
Oh, yes, but it never hurts
to hear it again.

17:49.482 --> 17:50.651
Yeah? Who am I kidding?

17:50.717 --> 17:52.452
I mean, what would
a prince like you

17:52.519 --> 17:54.821
want with an ugly duckling
like me?

17:55.956 --> 17:59.092
Oh, but you forget,
we've kissed.

17:59.159 --> 18:01.802
So now you're a beautiful swan
with, may I say

18:01.868 --> 18:04.738
uh, lovely tail feathers.

18:08.441 --> 18:10.110
Will you come back here at 5:01?

18:10.176 --> 18:11.111
Mm‐hmm.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.246
And I'll take a photo
of you so good

18:13.313 --> 18:15.248

it came from Sears.

vote that put you over the top

I wasn't gonna vote for you.

what I said about you

or denying the allegation.

trifling and full of garbage.
