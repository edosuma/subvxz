Now that Charlie Crews
is free,

00:04.740 --> 00:06.108
do you need
someone else to save?

00:06.141 --> 00:07.142
It's not about
what I need.

00:07.176 --> 00:09.579
Do I feel bad
about what happened?

00:09.612 --> 00:10.813
Yeah, I feel bad.

00:10.846 --> 00:12.682
Do I feel guilty?
No.

I was looking for you,
and I didn't even know it.

And now you're here,
and I can't have you.

I'm Neil Cudahy.

You're the reason
I'm sitting here.

Is that right?

00:27.462 --> 00:29.131
that Constance Griffiths
got you out,

I said, "That girl's
gotta be my lawyer."

00:47.883 --> 00:49.318
I'm so scared.

It was Cudahy.

No, no.
Not like that.

He just--
he wanted money.

01:15.678 --> 01:16.846
Like you got.

01:17.079 --> 01:18.413
He thought that
I could get that for him,

01:18.447 --> 01:22.151
and when I said that
I couldn't do that,

01:22.184 --> 01:24.519
then he hit me, and I...

How do you know?

02:55.244 --> 02:56.378
Well, I know the wings are fake

02:56.411 --> 02:58.213
because I can see
the harness right there.

giving your space away,

10:27.595 --> 10:28.562
Jasper Willens?

10:28.596 --> 10:29.797
Cause I'm afraid.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.699
Afraid of what?

10:33.601 --> 10:36.604
Afraid of the answer?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.005
That's right.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.072
There's an answer
at the front of the line.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.775
If you never get there,
you don't ever have to know?

10:41.809 --> 10:42.843
That's right.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.795
You think it's gonna be
bad news

10:44.828 --> 10:46.029
if you find out the truth?

10:46.063 --> 10:48.198
It usually is.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.700
I'm that guy.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.768
Which guy is that?

10:50.801 --> 10:53.804
The guy that gets the bad news.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.639
But you came down here, Jasper.

10:55.673 --> 10:58.208
So you did want to know,
didn't you?

10:59.943 --> 11:02.913
And now do you know
where you are?

11:02.946 --> 11:04.848
You're at the front
of the line.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.987
I saw the...

11:10.020 --> 11:12.590
photo on the news

11:12.623 --> 11:14.858
of that woman on the car.

11:14.892 --> 11:17.828
And I think I know her.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.168
How do you know her?

11:25.202 --> 11:28.806
She's Lena.

11:28.839 --> 11:30.040
My wife.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.832
I came home from work
last night,

11:39.866 --> 11:42.201
and Lena always
has dinner ready.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.336
She wasn't home.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.871
And she never came home.

11:45.904 --> 11:47.639
And then I saw the news.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.241
She always had dinner ready?

11:49.275 --> 11:50.642
Every night.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.411
She liked to cook.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.580
May I ask what kind of work
you do?

11:54.613 --> 11:55.614
I make glue.

11:55.647 --> 11:58.884
I-- I own a company
that makes industrial glues

11:58.917 --> 12:00.486
and adhesives.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.355
We moved over $14 million
dollars worth of product

12:03.389 --> 12:04.590
last year.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.492
That's a lot of glue.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.560
Well, it's what
holds us together.

12:08.594 --> 12:09.895
Oh.

12:09.928 --> 12:11.463
That's our slogan.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.698
"It's what
holds us together."

12:12.731 --> 12:14.600
Do you know why your wife
was at the hotel?

12:16.568 --> 12:19.571
I have to ask, uh...

12:19.605 --> 12:22.441
She was wearing wings.

12:22.474 --> 12:23.809
Do you know why?

12:23.842 --> 12:25.177
I never saw those.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.346
I don't know why
she would have them on.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.447
Do you know anyone

12:28.480 --> 12:29.920
who'd want to hurt
your wife, Jasper?

12:31.650 --> 12:32.918
He would.

12:32.951 --> 12:33.919
He?

12:33.952 --> 12:34.952
He told her he'd take her

12:34.953 --> 12:36.222
away from me if I didn't pay.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.723
But I paid every month,

12:37.756 --> 12:39.258
and he took her anyway.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.091
Who said that?

12:42.861 --> 12:43.962
Reese:
Tell us his name,

12:43.995 --> 12:45.197
Jasper.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.733
Then tell us about your wife.

12:47.766 --> 12:51.803
I-- I met Lena
about two years ago

12:51.837 --> 12:53.539
at this bar
that I'd heard about,

12:53.572 --> 12:54.540
Ritual.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.709
Where did you hear
about that bar?

12:57.743 --> 12:59.878
It's where an older man
can find...

12:59.911 --> 13:01.813
What he needed?
She was from Russia,

13:01.847 --> 13:02.781
and she'd had
a hard time there,

13:02.814 --> 13:05.484
and she liked that
I could make her laugh.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.486
And you had to pay every month?

13:07.519 --> 13:09.221
Not at first,
not for the first year.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.858
And then we got married,
and... and...

13:12.891 --> 13:14.993
I have to go now.

13:15.026 --> 13:16.828
I-- I just came to see
if it was Lena.

13:16.862 --> 13:17.729
To see if it was her,
and I--

13:17.763 --> 13:18.897
I need to go home now.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.866
What happened
when you got married?

13:22.801 --> 13:23.769
Is that door locked?

13:23.802 --> 13:24.936
You are in a police station.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.406
[Yelling] Is that door locked?

13:31.510 --> 13:33.845
What happened
when you were married?

13:37.883 --> 13:43.522
We came home that night,
from that party and...

13:43.555 --> 13:44.990
He was in our house.

13:45.023 --> 13:45.957
Who was?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.759
Why was he in your house?

13:47.793 --> 13:50.729
He was sitting in my kitchen.

13:50.762 --> 13:52.931
Lena must have
given him the key

13:52.964 --> 13:53.932
or the alarm code.

13:53.965 --> 13:55.901
He said that I owed him

13:55.934 --> 13:58.570
for the time that we'd already
spent together,

13:58.604 --> 14:00.672
and that if I wanted her
to stay with me,

14:00.706 --> 14:04.643
I had... I had to pay him
every month,

14:04.676 --> 14:05.944
or he would take her away

14:05.977 --> 14:09.715
and he would punish her.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.049
He beat her like a dog.

14:11.082 --> 14:14.753
He'd make Lena live in a cage

14:14.786 --> 14:16.388
like a dog.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.956
Tell us his name.

14:17.989 --> 14:19.691
I paid!

14:19.725 --> 14:23.595
I paid $10,000 every month!

14:23.629 --> 14:26.298
Why did he take her from me
if I paid?

14:26.332 --> 14:27.599
Why?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.737
Give us the name, Jasper,
of the man who killed Lena.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.511
Roman...

14:44.383 --> 14:45.551
Davis:
No last name, just Roman.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.718
Reese:
That's it.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.320
We're running it,
but Roman is like...

14:48.354 --> 14:51.590
John in Russian.

14:51.623 --> 14:52.691
So the Russian girl
is a Natasha.

14:52.724 --> 14:54.993
A Lena.

14:55.026 --> 14:58.464
No, her name is Lena,
but she's a Natasha.

14:58.497 --> 14:59.578
It's what they call the scam

14:59.598 --> 15:00.832
the Russians run
on American men.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.768
Get them hooked on a pretty
Russian girl,

15:02.801 --> 15:04.536
get them married,
then come for the payment.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.505
It's a long-term con.
Takes patience.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.440
Sounds like you admire them.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.542
I respect how good they are.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.479
And you'll respect them too,
or...

15:13.512 --> 15:14.546
Or...?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.882
Or they will feed you
to their dog.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.792
Industrial glue.

15:26.825 --> 15:28.794
It's what holds us together.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.802
A Natasha.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.837
That's one word for it.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.507
She was a prostitute,
Crews, not an angel.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.474
You can't be both?

15:42.508 --> 15:44.576
Well, I'm pretty sure
that there's a rule

15:44.610 --> 15:46.578
that says you can't be
a prostie and an angel.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.781
I know a prostitute at Pelican
Bay whose name was Angel.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.750
They have women at Pelican Bay?

15:51.783 --> 15:54.019
No, she wasn't a woman woman.

15:54.052 --> 15:57.956
And just to make it clear,
I didn't "know" her... him.

15:57.989 --> 15:59.558
Didn't know her-him.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.461
But she did make
a nice carrot cake.

16:11.703 --> 16:13.705
Maybe I should go in first.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.944
It's some kind of
upscale pick up joint,

16:18.977 --> 16:21.647
and, you know,
I'll go in and I'll...

16:21.680 --> 16:22.914
And you'll...?

16:22.948 --> 16:26.217
I'll get...
picked up.

16:31.289 --> 16:32.691
I'll be ten minutes.

16:40.365 --> 16:44.102
[Dance music]

16:44.135 --> 16:52.143
♫

16:57.315 --> 16:58.984
So I'm not too old, I hope.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.919
Ah, no.
Not too old.

17:00.952 --> 17:04.389
Anyways, I don't like
all these young men in L.A.

17:04.422 --> 17:05.390
I think I scare them.

17:05.423 --> 17:07.893
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

17:07.926 --> 17:10.128
Because they're
so easy to read.

17:10.161 --> 17:12.798
I can see how silly they are.

17:12.831 --> 17:14.232
They all want one thing,
you know?

17:14.465 --> 17:15.934
Can you read me?

17:15.967 --> 17:17.502
Do you want me to?

17:18.503 --> 17:19.470
I can tell...

17:19.504 --> 17:20.972
You have money.

17:21.006 --> 17:21.973
The watch told you that.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.241
I can tell

17:23.274 --> 17:24.442
it is new money.

17:24.475 --> 17:25.643
Now, how did you know that?

17:25.676 --> 17:28.313
And I can tell
that you do not know

17:28.346 --> 17:29.915
what to do with your new money.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.549
[Crews laughs]

17:34.152 --> 17:35.486
Do you know what else
I can tell?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.322
What?

17:37.355 --> 17:39.090
I can tell you're a cop.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.493
I can tell she's one too.

17:45.063 --> 17:47.232
Reese:
Her name was Lena.

17:47.265 --> 17:48.233
She was thrown from a window.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.969
I had seen her around,
but not for a long time.

17:51.002 --> 17:52.870
Do you know what a Natasha is?

17:54.372 --> 17:57.275
You let her talk for you?

17:57.308 --> 17:58.508
Do you know a man named Roman?

17:59.810 --> 18:01.646
I know a lot of men
named Roman.

18:01.679 --> 18:03.714
It is common name in Russia.

18:03.748 --> 18:05.850
Officer New Money,

18:05.883 --> 18:08.453
how come you let the woman
do your business?

18:08.486 --> 18:11.589
I can read people too.

18:11.622 --> 18:12.890
And I think it made you sad

18:12.923 --> 18:14.259
when Lena died.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.560
I also think you know

18:15.593 --> 18:17.428
the Roman my partner
asked you about.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.368
Know Roman?

18:23.401 --> 18:25.270
No one knows Roman.

18:25.303 --> 18:26.471
All right, really...

18:26.504 --> 18:27.772
What is it with this guy?

18:27.805 --> 18:30.441
What is with Roman?

18:30.475 --> 18:31.676
He's not what you American cops
are used to.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.511
He was born in Russian prison.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.513
He's been to hell and back.

18:35.546 --> 18:37.548
Roman is not
like the rest of us.

18:37.582 --> 18:39.484
Why is that?

18:39.517 --> 18:41.386
Roman has no fear.

18:41.419 --> 18:43.554
Well, I'd like to ask him
about that.

18:43.588 --> 18:44.722
Maybe you can tell us

18:44.755 --> 18:46.191
where to find him.

18:46.224 --> 18:47.225
Don't worry.

18:47.258 --> 18:49.760
If you're looking for Roman,
he will find you.

18:49.794 --> 18:52.763
But you can't hold on to him.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.634
When you reach out for Roman,
he's not there.

18:58.736 --> 19:01.539
[Knocking at the door]

19:01.572 --> 19:04.409
I saw the news.

19:04.442 --> 19:05.376
So she wasn't an angel
after all.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.713
She was just a...
a what?

19:08.746 --> 19:10.648
Just a lost girl.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.683
Hey,

19:12.717 --> 19:14.319
you didn't file a report
about Cudahy

19:14.352 --> 19:15.386
about what happened.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.288
Oh, I'm done with it.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.624
You're done with it.

19:20.858 --> 19:22.360
Right, Charlie?
You're done with it.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.697
Do you want to talk
about these boxes?

19:26.731 --> 19:27.765
Do you like them?

19:27.798 --> 19:28.966
Do you want to talk about

19:28.999 --> 19:30.868
why you're packing books
into these boxes,

19:30.901 --> 19:33.271
'cause it's what people do
when they're moving.

19:33.304 --> 19:36.341
Pack books into boxes.

19:36.374 --> 19:39.176
I'm going to need them
with me in New York.

19:41.312 --> 19:42.947
I'm going to New York.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.282
When?

19:44.715 --> 19:47.685
Tomorrow.

19:49.153 --> 19:50.220
For how long?

19:50.254 --> 19:51.321
A while.

19:51.355 --> 19:53.724
My firm has a big case there,

19:53.758 --> 19:55.860
and I'm going to sit in on it.

19:58.829 --> 20:00.931
New York.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.366
City that never sleeps.

20:02.399 --> 20:03.668
No, I've been there.

20:03.701 --> 20:04.669
It sleeps a little.

20:04.702 --> 20:05.936
Naps.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.137
I need to go, Charlie.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.239
I need to go away.

20:09.473 --> 20:11.241
My husband...

20:11.275 --> 20:12.809
I'm here with him,
but I'm away from him.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.778
And you...

20:14.811 --> 20:17.481
I'm here with you,
but I'm--

20:17.514 --> 20:20.050
I'm not here with you.

20:22.652 --> 20:25.155
I need to go.

20:27.324 --> 20:29.126
Want some help
with those boxes?

20:29.159 --> 20:33.697
No, my husband's on his way,
and he's going to help me...

20:37.501 --> 20:39.369
...pack.

20:39.403 --> 20:43.640
So I guess
I should take off then.

20:43.673 --> 20:45.842
Yeah.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.611
Okay.

20:51.448 --> 20:53.417
Roman is Roman Nevikov.

20:53.450 --> 20:54.584
We ran financials on Ritual.

in his jacket.

to reach out

you hold on to him.

Crews: He'd kill her
to set an example.

33:29.035 --> 33:30.471
That's right.

33:30.504 --> 33:31.638
To set an example.

33:33.307 --> 33:34.375
And what about Oliver?

33:35.742 --> 33:37.311
I die, you know,

33:37.344 --> 33:39.313
as I say these things to you.

33:39.346 --> 33:40.414
These words kill me.

33:40.447 --> 33:41.482
We can protect you.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.323
What would he do
to sweet Oliver

33:49.356 --> 33:51.024
for trying to steal Lena?

33:51.057 --> 33:53.594
Trying to steal his property?

33:53.627 --> 33:55.796
Death would be too good for him.

33:59.032 --> 34:01.402
You understand, don't you?

34:07.941 --> 34:09.343
Jasper: Is that door locked?

34:09.376 --> 34:10.877
Reese:
You're at a police station.

34:10.911 --> 34:14.715
Is that door locked?

34:14.748 --> 34:16.317
That's a lot of fear, Jasper.

34:16.350 --> 34:17.618
To be so afraid of someone

34:17.651 --> 34:18.985
in the middle
of a police station.

34:19.219 --> 34:22.222
That kind of fear
doesn't come from a threat.

34:22.255 --> 34:24.457
It comes from a beating.

34:25.926 --> 34:28.228
When you talked
about the dogs, Jasper,

34:28.261 --> 34:29.896
about what Roman would do,

34:29.930 --> 34:31.231
did he do it to you?

34:33.534 --> 34:34.568
Did he show you the cage?

34:36.703 --> 34:38.204
Roman's going to kill
someone else, Jasper.

34:38.438 --> 34:40.106
Someone Lena--

34:42.943 --> 34:44.244
someone Lena loved.

34:48.114 --> 34:49.449
Where are the cages?

34:50.350 --> 34:53.887
He blindfolded me.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.121
I can't tell you
where they are.

34:55.155 --> 34:57.090
Do you remember anything?

34:57.123 --> 34:58.391
Anything that might be useful?

34:58.424 --> 35:00.727
It smelled like gasoline.

35:00.761 --> 35:02.095
Even with all those dogs,

35:02.128 --> 35:03.830
it smelled like gasoline.

35:04.931 --> 35:06.366
Crews:
What about that gas scam

35:06.399 --> 35:07.734
that Roman was never tied to?

35:07.768 --> 35:10.003
Where did they operate out of?

35:24.350 --> 35:25.786
Gasoline.
No one fires.

35:28.388 --> 35:29.389
[Dogs barking]

35:49.409 --> 35:50.877
Police officer: Over here!

35:57.550 --> 36:00.520
[Whimpering]

36:05.425 --> 36:08.028
She was my angel.

36:08.061 --> 36:09.195
Did Roman kill Lena?

36:09.229 --> 36:11.297
He threw her out that window.

36:11.331 --> 36:12.999
We met there.

36:13.033 --> 36:14.434
We thought we were safe,

36:14.467 --> 36:16.569
we thought nobody
could find us.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.972
He found you.

36:19.005 --> 36:20.306
She'd put the wings on for me.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.108
I'd draw her...

36:22.142 --> 36:24.244
For me.

36:24.277 --> 36:26.046
Roman found you.

36:26.079 --> 36:27.080
Yes, she--

36:27.113 --> 36:29.950
she told him
we were gonna leave.

36:29.983 --> 36:31.217
He laughed at us,

36:31.251 --> 36:33.253
he laughed at her wings.

36:33.286 --> 36:35.155
She...

36:35.188 --> 36:37.157
Spit at him and...

36:37.190 --> 36:38.291
And then?

36:38.324 --> 36:41.161
Then he threw her
out the window!

36:41.194 --> 36:42.863
Took me here

36:42.896 --> 36:46.066
to be his dog.

36:48.168 --> 36:50.236
Will you testify to that
in court?

36:53.073 --> 36:54.307
You will testify
that Roman killed Lena?

36:54.340 --> 36:57.177
Yes.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.479
He made me his dog.

37:41.687 --> 37:43.890
[Laughing]

37:58.171 --> 37:59.405
Ready?

37:59.439 --> 38:01.107
Ready, ready.

38:05.345 --> 38:06.980
Davis:
Detectives Reese and Crews,

38:07.013 --> 38:08.648
this is Special Agent Bodner.

38:08.681 --> 38:11.051
Homeland Security.

38:11.084 --> 38:12.518
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna like
what happens next.

38:12.552 --> 38:14.087
Well, I'd just say
lay back and get it over with.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.357
But we took this seminar,
so now I don't talk like that.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.592
You took Roman.
Detective, we've had Roman.

38:19.825 --> 38:20.893
He's ours.
He's always been ours.

38:21.126 --> 38:22.027
He killed a woman.

38:22.061 --> 38:23.429
We have a witness
that'll testify to that.

38:23.463 --> 38:24.997
I'm sure you do.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.699
But you can't have a trial,
because you can't have Roman.

38:26.732 --> 38:27.767
Like I said, he's ours.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.768
He threw a woman
out the window.

38:28.801 --> 38:30.836
Roman Nevikov provides
information

38:30.870 --> 38:32.405
about drug and arms shipments

38:32.438 --> 38:33.873
between Russia, Mexico,
and the U.S.

38:33.906 --> 38:35.641
That intel can save
hundreds of lives.

38:35.675 --> 38:38.043
[Both speaking at once]

38:38.077 --> 38:39.144
That's enough.

38:39.178 --> 38:40.145
Detective, you have no idea
how the real worlds works,

38:40.179 --> 38:41.339
do you?
No, but I know how guys

38:41.347 --> 38:43.716
like you work, and it's all
about the power, isn't it?

38:43.749 --> 38:46.686
Davis:
You-- you close your mouth now.

38:46.719 --> 38:49.355
And you.

38:49.389 --> 38:51.924
Take your Russian and get
the hell out of my house.

39:04.404 --> 39:06.406
"You can't hold on to him.

39:06.439 --> 39:09.341
You reach out for Roman,
but he isn't there."

39:21.854 --> 39:23.055
Hello, Neil.

39:23.088 --> 39:24.857
Oh, je--
[Shouting]

39:28.193 --> 39:30.029
I'm trying to forgive you,
Cudahy.

39:30.062 --> 39:34.934
But what you did
to Constance...

39:34.967 --> 39:36.902
I just wanted what you got.

39:39.905 --> 39:40.906
Oh!

39:47.212 --> 39:48.814
They paid you that money
just to shut up.

39:48.848 --> 39:49.949
Why shouldn't they pay me too?

39:49.982 --> 39:51.984
[Groans]

39:53.753 --> 39:56.689
I know I'd be a better person
if I did forgive you.

39:56.722 --> 39:58.624
I just wanted what you got.

39:58.658 --> 40:00.392
Man:
I've called the police.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.602
[Sighs]

40:09.635 --> 40:12.705
I am the police.

40:21.013 --> 40:22.815
Hey.
Hey.

40:22.848 --> 40:24.684
Hey, did you ever find
that guy you were looking for?

40:24.717 --> 40:27.853
No.
No, I never did.

40:27.887 --> 40:30.823
[Phone ringing]

40:30.856 --> 40:31.924
Hello?

40:31.957 --> 40:32.925
[Nevikov on phone] Detective...

40:32.958 --> 40:35.160
I have something you might be
interested in.

40:35.594 --> 40:38.097
Oh, yeah?
What would that be?

40:38.130 --> 40:40.099
The Bank of Los Angeles
shoot-out.

40:40.132 --> 40:41.133
How 'bout it?

40:41.166 --> 40:42.201
You should ask your partner

40:42.234 --> 40:44.203
about the Bank of L.A.
shoot-out.

40:47.039 --> 40:48.307
That was 15 years ago.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.308
I know.

40:49.341 --> 40:51.143
You should ask your partner.

40:51.176 --> 40:53.278
You should ask your partner

40:53.312 --> 40:57.216
what happened
to all that money.

40:57.249 --> 40:58.050
Good-bye, detective.
