00:10.184 --> 00:11.772
<i>Previously,
on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:11.774 --> 00:13.866
I don't write
for the dot-com.

00:13.868 --> 00:15.431
Welcome to the digital team,
Jane.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.273
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

00:17.275 --> 00:19.275
People don't want perfection,
they want honesty.

00:19.277 --> 00:21.677
This is the real me.
Heartbroken.

00:21.679 --> 00:24.280
<i>And I think it's about time
we started being real</i>

00:24.282 --> 00:25.441
- <i>with one another.</i>
- Look at how many people

00:25.443 --> 00:27.203
you're inspiring.

00:27.205 --> 00:29.285
You're also a carrier
of the BRCA gene.

00:29.287 --> 00:31.287
- That is a game-changer for you.
- Why?

00:31.289 --> 00:33.168
<i>If kids are in your future,
you need to start thinking</i>

00:33.170 --> 00:34.770
about it now.

00:34.772 --> 00:36.131
<i>Richard asked me
to move in with him.</i>

00:36.133 --> 00:37.613
I don't want to lose this.

00:37.615 --> 00:39.455
- Me.
- What do you want to do?

00:39.457 --> 00:40.696
I want to move in
with Richard.

00:47.304 --> 00:49.505
Turns out I am a hoarder.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.426
- Who knew?
- I did.

00:51.428 --> 00:53.629
- Ha-ha.
- Gonna miss your mess, though.

00:53.631 --> 00:56.592
I know you will.

00:56.594 --> 00:59.074
I think I'm all packed.

01:00.798 --> 01:04.399
Officially out of here.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.322
Oh.
Thanks.

01:07.324 --> 01:09.805
You know, um...

01:09.807 --> 01:11.726
I could just ask them
to move my bed back and forth.

01:11.728 --> 01:13.648
Mm, you probably should.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.490
But first they should
take their shirts off.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.372
- It's very hot in here, right?
- Yeah, so hot.

01:17.374 --> 01:19.376
You know...

01:20.617 --> 01:22.657
As long as I live here,

01:22.659 --> 01:26.261
it's your home, too.

01:26.263 --> 01:27.782
I know.

01:29.186 --> 01:31.346
I love you.

01:38.235 --> 01:41.236
Stop.

01:41.238 --> 01:43.358
- Why are you taking this?
- Come on.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.520
Yes, my sex life
with Richard is fantastic,

01:45.522 --> 01:47.402
but I am not leaving
Mr. Hemsworth.

01:47.404 --> 01:48.523
"Mr. Hemsworth"?

01:48.525 --> 01:50.306
This is "Reliable Buddy."

02:05.482 --> 02:07.642
Uh, excuse me,
I think that I know

02:07.644 --> 02:10.324
my vibrator when I see it.
I got it at the...

02:10.326 --> 02:13.249
Pink Pussycat on Bleeker.

02:20.496 --> 02:22.857
- Mines missing.
- Okay.

02:22.859 --> 02:26.220
That doesn't mean
that we swapped... vibrators.

02:26.222 --> 02:27.822
You keep yours
near your bed, right?

02:27.824 --> 02:30.424
Yeah! Oh, except for
when we had the dinner party,

02:30.426 --> 02:31.826
so I moved it from my bedroom
to the...

02:31.828 --> 02:33.227
Bathroom.

02:33.229 --> 02:34.748
Where I dumped
my makeup bag...

02:34.750 --> 02:35.629
After I got back

02:35.631 --> 02:36.790
from Jersey Shore.

02:36.792 --> 02:37.831
You know what, you take it.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.633
Actually, I think it's yours.

02:39.635 --> 02:41.515
- Nope, it isn't.
- No, it is,

02:41.517 --> 02:43.517
- because mine has a dent in it.
- How did you dent it?

02:43.519 --> 02:45.559
- Don't ask me questions.
- It is a going-away present.

02:45.561 --> 02:47.801
- You're welcome.
- No thanks, not necessary.

02:47.803 --> 02:48.802
I don't want it.
Take it.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.733
Well, let's do this.

03:00.776 --> 03:03.337
Love ya.
Thanks.

03:12.347 --> 03:14.828
You know...

03:14.830 --> 03:17.270
I really thought
I had less stuff.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.872
Well, thank God
you have this lamp.

03:18.874 --> 03:21.274
Which is great,
'cause I've had my eye on it

03:21.276 --> 03:22.355
in your apartment for a while
now.

03:22.357 --> 03:24.718
Ah.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.680
And, uh, this is dirty,
I assume?

03:26.682 --> 03:28.521
Yes, very.

03:28.523 --> 03:30.403
With the move and work,

03:30.405 --> 03:31.925
I haven't had much time
to do anything.

03:31.927 --> 03:33.566
Oliver's been leaning on me
a lot, so...

03:33.568 --> 03:35.528
All right, well, dirty laundry
goes in the closet.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.971
- Fran does it on Monday.
- Oh, hey, uh...

03:37.973 --> 03:40.013
you know,
Fran is your housekeeper.

03:40.015 --> 03:42.936
She doesn't work for me.

03:42.938 --> 03:46.379
Fran is your housekeeper
because you live here now.

03:46.381 --> 03:47.380
- I live here.
- Yeah.

03:47.382 --> 03:48.861
That's so great.

03:48.863 --> 03:50.943
I think I'm still gonna do
my own laundry, though.

03:50.945 --> 03:52.785
What... seriously?
'Cause you don't have to.

03:52.787 --> 03:55.027
I know, but I like to.

03:55.029 --> 03:58.511
And anyway, these are
my unmentionables.

03:58.513 --> 04:00.873
Then I shall not
mention them.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.718
But I shall go tip the movers.

04:17.892 --> 04:20.052
Okay, come on out.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.414
I wanna see you in your
hockey outfit before you go.

04:22.416 --> 04:23.776
It's not an outfit.

04:23.778 --> 04:26.739
- It's a uniform.
- I like it.

04:26.741 --> 04:29.421
Give me a little spin.

04:29.423 --> 04:30.903
Whoo, yeah.

04:30.905 --> 04:31.904
Wow.

04:31.906 --> 04:34.586
You are so hot.

04:34.588 --> 04:36.428
You are gonna melt that ice,

04:36.430 --> 04:37.910
which is gonna send that puck

04:37.912 --> 04:40.352
right into the net.

04:40.354 --> 04:42.514
Yeah, I mean,
I want to like it, but no.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.518
It's not doing it for me.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.682
But...

04:49.603 --> 04:51.964
What is doing it for me
is the fact that

04:51.966 --> 04:53.445
you made me a pre-game snack.

04:53.447 --> 04:56.048
Oh, no.

04:56.050 --> 04:58.370
"Follitropin"?

04:58.372 --> 04:59.971
Oh, hey,
is it egg-freezing time?

04:59.973 --> 05:01.933
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.096
Uh, I went to the doctor
and they gave me the go-ahead

05:04.098 --> 05:05.977
to start
my egg-freezing process.

05:05.979 --> 05:08.620
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

05:08.622 --> 05:10.462
- That's a big deal.
- I guess.

05:10.464 --> 05:12.704
I mean, it's just
some injections

05:12.706 --> 05:15.867
and then the egg extraction,
which is a small procedure,

05:15.869 --> 05:17.629
but, uh, it's pretty
straight-forward.

05:17.631 --> 05:19.911
Oh, except, um, no drinking,

05:19.913 --> 05:21.713
no carbs,
and no sex for two weeks.

05:21.715 --> 05:22.834
I probably should have
told you that.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.676
Uh, yeah.

05:24.678 --> 05:26.638
Are you kidding me?

05:26.640 --> 05:29.362
No carbs for two weeks?

05:31.805 --> 05:34.606
- So, what can I do?
- Nothing.

05:34.608 --> 05:37.408
They taught me how to do
the injections at the doctor's.

05:37.410 --> 05:40.131
- Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.
- You're gonna inject yourself?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.133
- Mm-hmm.
- I can help.

05:42.135 --> 05:43.574
I mean, I can be late
for hockey, it doesn't matter.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.096
No, no, no.
You have playoffs,

05:45.098 --> 05:47.538
- which is so exciting...
- Mm.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.021
And, uh, I'm fine, so go.

05:50.023 --> 05:52.423
- And go Ryan's hockey team.
- The Zambronis, you mean?

05:52.425 --> 05:53.664
The Zambronis.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.668
Go.

05:56.669 --> 05:58.109
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.604
All right.

06:19.932 --> 06:22.132
Here goes Operation
"Freeze Jane's Eggs

06:22.134 --> 06:24.136
to Keep Her Options Open
for Her Future."

06:30.663 --> 06:32.503
- That's it?
- Yep.

06:32.505 --> 06:33.864
Wow.

06:33.866 --> 06:35.826
Bikini waxes laugh at that.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.668
- Hah.
- Yeah.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.791
- Okay, so it is 10:30...
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.793 --> 06:42.513
So for the next ten days,

06:42.515 --> 06:45.516
I have to take the injection
at the exact same time.

06:45.518 --> 06:46.957
Okey-dokey.

06:46.959 --> 06:50.200
You know, I love any excuse
to hang out, but

06:50.202 --> 06:52.602
why don't you just get Pinstripe
to help you with this stuff?

06:52.604 --> 06:54.164
Because, I mean,

06:54.166 --> 06:56.006
we're seven weeks
into our relationship.

06:56.008 --> 06:58.088
I don't want to
kill our early, fun dating vibe

06:58.090 --> 07:00.771
with "alcohol wipes,
hormone injection,

07:00.773 --> 07:02.572
mild cramping" vibes.

07:02.574 --> 07:05.055
This is mucking through
some tough stuff, and...

07:05.057 --> 07:07.177
It's too early for mucking.

07:07.179 --> 07:08.899
You want to focus
on the other "ucking."

07:08.901 --> 07:10.140
Exactly.

07:10.142 --> 07:13.063
I'm really happy.

07:13.065 --> 07:16.146
And I want to protect
what we have.

07:16.148 --> 07:19.509
You know, it might
bring you closer together.

07:19.511 --> 07:20.590
Really?

07:20.592 --> 07:22.912
Well, answer this question:

07:22.914 --> 07:24.834
Did you poop in front of Adena?

07:24.836 --> 07:26.756
I don't know what that has
to do with anything.

07:26.758 --> 07:29.759
Answer the question.

07:29.761 --> 07:32.081
I'd go to the Duane Reade...

07:32.083 --> 07:33.923
On my corner.

07:33.925 --> 07:36.005
But I'm an only child.
I don't poop in front of anyone.

07:36.007 --> 07:38.047
And I don't see what
pooping has to do

07:38.049 --> 07:39.929
with fertility injections.

07:39.931 --> 07:42.091
It's something that has
to be done, and just because

07:42.093 --> 07:43.933
it's happening doesn't mean
that Ryan needs to be there.

07:43.935 --> 07:45.615
I already have a plan.

07:45.617 --> 07:47.216
His hockey team
is in the playoffs.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.939
He's busy, and once
hockey season is over,

07:49.941 --> 07:52.662
I'll be done with this, and
we are back to where we were.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.824
Non-stop "ucking."

07:56.588 --> 07:58.748
Is that how you "uck"?

08:02.914 --> 08:04.916
How you doing?

08:05.636 --> 08:06.716
I'm good.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.037
Yeah, better.

08:08.039 --> 08:11.560
- What about you?
- I'm... I'm great.

08:11.562 --> 08:13.762
So last night I got into
one of those obligatory

08:13.764 --> 08:15.684
"is social media good or bad?"
debates,

08:15.686 --> 08:17.766
and you came up
on the side of good.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.808
Kat, your #BeReal campaign

08:19.810 --> 08:22.251
has exploded, it's incredible.

08:22.253 --> 08:24.253
I mean, look, look.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.775
- That's crazy.
- Break-ups, unemployment,

08:26.777 --> 08:28.297
health issues.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.139
I mean, it's amazing.

08:30.141 --> 08:32.101
- I keep scrolling.
- Oh, hold on.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.942
- What?
- Yeah, just go back up.

08:33.943 --> 08:35.823
- This?
- Yeah.

08:35.826 --> 08:37.986
"After 30 years, my bar
is being shut down.

08:37.988 --> 08:41.068
"I'm devastated that
the safe haven I've created for

08:41.071 --> 08:43.191
queer women
will be gone forever."

08:43.193 --> 08:45.874
You know this place, Wild Susan?

08:45.876 --> 08:48.156
Yeah, it...
Adena took me there once,

08:48.158 --> 08:50.679
and it's kind of become my spot.

08:56.326 --> 08:57.886
I'm gonna be
in and out today.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.168
Cover when needed.
Text when necessary.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.771
- Call when... don't call.
- Okay.

09:02.773 --> 09:05.013
- Where you going?
- Out.

09:05.015 --> 09:06.134
I'm gonna need you to run point

09:06.136 --> 09:08.176
on the prom-themed shoot.

09:08.178 --> 09:10.258
- I will not be there.
- And it's all set?

09:10.260 --> 09:13.181
- Models, photographers booked?
- Yes.

09:13.183 --> 09:14.783
We can effectively memorialize

09:14.785 --> 09:16.304
the most traumatic night
of my youth.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.026
Oh, no.
You hated prom?

09:18.028 --> 09:20.668
- I... don't call.
- 'Kay, bye!

09:28.878 --> 09:31.039
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.760
Sorry, I didn't want
to interrupt.

09:32.762 --> 09:34.242
Oh, not at all.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.084
I did this incredible retreat
at Kripalu

09:36.086 --> 09:37.725
and they taught me
mini-meditations.

09:37.727 --> 09:39.207
Five minutes and
I'm fully aligned

09:39.209 --> 09:40.728
with the present moment.

09:40.730 --> 09:43.090
And here for you, so go.

09:43.092 --> 09:44.972
I'm starting my
egg-freezing process this week.

09:44.974 --> 09:46.174
- Obsessed.
- Good.

09:46.176 --> 09:47.375
Because I'm
writing a piece on it.

09:47.377 --> 09:50.378
Wait, Jane.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.059
So what's your angle?

09:52.061 --> 09:54.382
Demystifying
the egg-freezing process.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.704
Mm.
Yeah, needs a little bit more.

09:56.706 --> 09:58.826
No problem. It's probably
better for the magazine anyway.

09:58.828 --> 10:00.388
Remember,
you write for the dot-com.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.069
I really want this one
for the dot-com,

10:02.071 --> 10:04.311
so we just need to plus it up.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.073
Plus it up?

10:06.075 --> 10:08.756
Plus up the challenges
of my medical condition?

10:08.758 --> 10:10.758
Yeah, next-level it.
Find a fresh angle.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.760
Once you figure that out,
then you can write your piece.

10:12.762 --> 10:14.842
Okay.

10:14.844 --> 10:16.764
Thanks, Jane.

10:21.851 --> 10:23.731
Jacqueline.

10:23.733 --> 10:25.933
Andrew told me
you wanted to talk?

10:25.935 --> 10:29.256
Yes, I saw that you are
reaching out to Cardi B

10:29.258 --> 10:31.778
for digital's new
date-night column.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.340
I was hoping that maybe
you could hold off on that,

10:33.342 --> 10:35.943
because we're trying
to get Cardi for a feature

10:35.945 --> 10:38.305
in the magazine, and it's
kind of an either/or situation.

10:38.307 --> 10:40.187
Wow.

10:40.189 --> 10:41.348
Do you have a problem
with that?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.070
No, I'm just
a little surprised.

10:43.072 --> 10:44.911
Patrick,
it's really important

10:44.913 --> 10:47.234
that digital and print
work well together,

10:47.236 --> 10:49.716
especially since
we're sharing resources...

10:49.718 --> 10:51.037
You misunderstand.

10:51.039 --> 10:53.039
Of course,
I will hold off on Cardi B.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.402
I'm just a little surprised
that digital and print

10:55.404 --> 10:58.725
are throwing elbows
for the same talent.

10:58.727 --> 11:00.327
Mm, I gotta up my game.

11:04.172 --> 11:07.053
"Plus it up"?
Egg-freezing is emotional,

11:07.055 --> 11:09.416
and hard, and plenty plussed-up.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.217
Okay, look, I know
you don't like the guy,

11:11.219 --> 11:12.338
but you have to admit
it's pretty cool that

11:12.340 --> 11:14.821
he authorized a field trip
to Wild Susan.

11:14.823 --> 11:17.303
I want you guys to see
how great it is.

11:17.305 --> 11:18.945
Hey, do you guys think
it's weird that I don't

11:18.947 --> 11:20.426
want Richard's housekeeper
doing my laundry?

11:20.428 --> 11:22.268
- That's insane.
- Yes.

11:22.270 --> 11:24.190
I bet he's had a housekeeper
his whole life.

11:24.192 --> 11:27.033
Well, I've had
a housekeeper my whole life.

11:27.035 --> 11:29.315
I had my aunt come over
and help my brother and I

11:29.317 --> 11:31.918
clean the house,
but my life goal is to be

11:31.920 --> 11:34.320
successful enough to never
have to do my own laundry again.

11:34.322 --> 11:36.242
Not only have I never had a
housekeeper,

11:36.244 --> 11:39.165
but in 12th grade
I almost was one at a hotel.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.848
- What happened?
- Failed the drug test.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.852
I don't get it.

11:46.854 --> 11:48.454
I mean, this place is packed.

11:48.456 --> 11:51.337
- Why is it closing?
- It's a scam.

11:51.339 --> 11:53.499
They say we owe 42 grand
to the state liquor authority,

11:53.501 --> 11:54.940
but the fines are 20 years old

11:54.942 --> 11:56.342
and we didn't even
know about them.

11:56.344 --> 11:58.344
Most of it is penalty.
We can't afford that.

11:58.346 --> 12:00.306
So, why did they come up now?

12:00.308 --> 12:02.828
Owner, city, developer,
they want to gentrify

12:02.830 --> 12:04.870
the neighborhood,
so they dug them up.

12:04.872 --> 12:06.151
Now we have to pay them
all at once or

12:06.153 --> 12:08.033
we're in breach of our lease.

12:08.035 --> 12:10.115
It was a good run,
but we're done.

12:10.117 --> 12:12.037
Thank you.

12:12.039 --> 12:15.160
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

12:15.162 --> 12:17.122
You know, I love going to
straight bars with you guys,

12:17.124 --> 12:20.365
I do,
but I'm still finding myself

12:20.367 --> 12:22.488
and finding my place,
and having a bar like this

12:22.490 --> 12:24.930
has been really great.

12:24.932 --> 12:27.412
And now they're gonna tear it
down to build a luxury condo.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.054
Well, you know what,

12:29.056 --> 12:30.375
we can go to other
lesbian bars with you.

12:30.377 --> 12:32.137
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you know, this is

12:32.139 --> 12:35.220
actually one of only two
lesbian bars in the city.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.541
- What?
- You're kidding.

12:36.543 --> 12:38.543
It's ridiculous.

12:38.545 --> 12:41.346
You know what,
I'm texting my lawyer.

12:41.348 --> 12:43.508
You have a lawyer?

12:43.510 --> 12:45.230
I do.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.272
She did #BeReal
and hated her firm

12:47.274 --> 12:49.354
and quit, and we DM'd.

12:49.356 --> 12:51.436
And now I have a lawyer.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.198
- Do I need a lawyer?
- Yeah.

12:55.362 --> 12:57.162
Oh, no.

12:57.164 --> 12:58.523
I gotta go.

12:58.525 --> 13:00.405
- Sorry.
- What?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.372
Hey.
So, um,

13:07.374 --> 13:09.094
we really have to get going.
Is Deirdre ready?

13:09.096 --> 13:10.535
Why did Oliver
book Nick Chassen?

13:10.537 --> 13:12.337
Because he's great
at doing make-up.

13:12.339 --> 13:13.578
Yeah, well, Nick's also
the guy she caught

13:13.580 --> 13:15.260
blowing her boyfriend
last Christmas.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.061
Oliver knew that.
What was he thinking?

13:17.063 --> 13:18.503
Give me one second.

13:18.505 --> 13:20.385
Hey, Deirdre.

13:20.387 --> 13:22.467
Well, see you
practicing that smolder.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.589
Let's get you some of that
genius face-painting.

13:24.591 --> 13:26.951
Yeah, try Bob Ross,

13:26.953 --> 13:27.992
because if she's the model
then you're losing

13:27.994 --> 13:29.594
the best make-up artist in town.

13:29.596 --> 13:31.596
Best at blowing guys
too drunk to care.

13:31.598 --> 13:33.958
- Trust me, he cared.
- Oh.

13:33.960 --> 13:34.959
- Screw this.
- Fine.

13:34.961 --> 13:37.281
Oh, no, no.
Um, guys!

13:37.283 --> 13:39.283
Okay.
Hey, can you give me ten minutes

13:39.285 --> 13:41.445
- and I can figure this out?
- No, you won't.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.287
I can't believe
Oliver booked them together.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.129
I'm billing for this time.

13:48.614 --> 13:50.414
Actually, the thing is,
they're all very distinct.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.615
It makes my job
relatively easy.

13:51.617 --> 13:53.337
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:53.339 --> 13:54.578
What are you doing here?

13:54.580 --> 13:56.100
I just had
a meeting with Trish.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.541
My editor.
I have a book deal.

13:57.543 --> 13:59.183
Oh, I know Trish.
She... she's great.

13:59.185 --> 14:01.265
She just did Marina's book.
Abromavic.

14:01.267 --> 14:02.586
- Right, yeah.
- I'm sorry.

14:02.588 --> 14:04.308
Do you two know each other?

14:04.310 --> 14:06.230
Well, we just met,

14:06.232 --> 14:07.992
but I loved his column
in "Pinstripe"

14:07.994 --> 14:10.634
and I'm super into the fact
that he's dating you.

14:10.636 --> 14:12.076
Good times.

14:12.078 --> 14:14.318
Uh, we should all
go back to work.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.400
Well, maybe we are working.

14:16.402 --> 14:18.122
I mean, isn't that the
cool thing about being a writer,

14:18.124 --> 14:20.964
you could argue that
every life moment is material?

14:20.966 --> 14:23.207
No, not every life moment.

14:23.209 --> 14:24.968
- It's debatable.
- Agree to disagree.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.290
You agreeing to
disagree with me

14:26.292 --> 14:27.531
- is material.
- That doesn't make sense.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.294
Pitch:
You two should write about

14:30.296 --> 14:32.376
your egg-freezing process
together.

14:32.378 --> 14:34.097
- Cool.
- No.

14:34.099 --> 14:36.019
Think about it:
Two brilliant writers,

14:36.021 --> 14:39.182
who are a couple, going through
this monumental change together.

14:39.184 --> 14:42.425
You could really dig in, explore
the hopes around it, the fears.

14:42.427 --> 14:46.510
Well, I hope...
that this isn't happening.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.633
Well, I really
want it to, so...

14:49.635 --> 14:52.075
- I'm afraid that it is, okay?
- We'll make it work.

14:52.077 --> 14:53.637
Good.

14:53.639 --> 14:55.198
Looking forward to it.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.040
- Good meeting you, Ryan.
- You, too.

14:57.042 --> 14:58.682
Thanks for the gig.

15:03.263 --> 15:05.634
So, how do you want
to do this?

15:05.636 --> 15:07.275
Should we take turns typing?

15:07.277 --> 15:09.960
Or maybe one of us
controls the keyboard.

15:11.121 --> 15:12.641
Who am I kidding,
that's all you.

15:12.643 --> 15:14.282
Yeah, that's probably best.

15:14.284 --> 15:15.443
I think it would be
really helpful if

15:15.445 --> 15:17.165
you broke it all down for me,

15:17.167 --> 15:19.167
explained the whole process
so far.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.089
Also, I'd really love to
get a schedule of

15:21.091 --> 15:23.131
all of your doctor's visits,
your injections.

15:23.133 --> 15:24.612
I wanna be there for all of it.

15:24.614 --> 15:26.494
Also, I want to
talk about side-effects.

15:26.496 --> 15:28.656
Are you experiencing mood swings
because of all the hormones,

15:28.658 --> 15:31.459
or is it more physical stuff
like bloating, cramping?

15:31.461 --> 15:33.061
You know,
I don't really think

15:33.063 --> 15:34.903
that approaching it
this way makes sense.

15:34.905 --> 15:37.465
So is that a "yes"
on the mood swings?

15:37.467 --> 15:40.508
Okay, well, what's your angle?

15:40.510 --> 15:43.311
Well, um...

15:43.313 --> 15:44.632
I was thinking it could be

15:44.634 --> 15:46.994
a he-said, she-said?

15:46.996 --> 15:49.957
Go off on our own,
write from our own perspectives.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.320
I mean, you're Pinstripe,
right?

15:52.322 --> 15:54.322
Actually, that was always
your nickname for me.

15:54.324 --> 15:57.285
- Not really mine, but okay.
- I just mean...

15:57.287 --> 16:00.408
Patrick really loved
your column,

16:00.410 --> 16:03.050
and, uh, we can't have sex
for ten days.

16:03.052 --> 16:05.973
That's something
you could write about.

16:05.975 --> 16:09.216
Well, that's not really
an angle that interests me.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.379
Jane, I know we've never
written together before,

16:11.381 --> 16:13.701
but I think this could be a
really cool bonding experience.

16:13.703 --> 16:16.023
We could be like Michael Chabon
and Ayelet Waldman,

16:16.025 --> 16:18.025
only with less micro-dosing.

16:18.027 --> 16:21.230
I don't really think
this story lends itself to that.

16:23.512 --> 16:24.952
Okay.

16:24.954 --> 16:26.553
- Um...
- I'm so sorry.

16:26.555 --> 16:28.075
I forgot I have a meeting.

16:28.077 --> 16:31.198
Um... but look,
it's gonna be great

16:31.200 --> 16:34.441
and I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

16:34.443 --> 16:36.283
All right, Sloan,
however you want to do it.

16:36.285 --> 16:38.725
But you still have to keep me
looped in on the process.

16:38.727 --> 16:40.207
I wanna know
what's going on here.

16:40.209 --> 16:42.569
Yeah, um, absolutely.

16:42.571 --> 16:44.251
You'll be looped.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.053
Happy writing.

16:54.743 --> 16:56.063
Hello.

16:56.065 --> 16:58.024
- Hi.
- Sutton.

16:58.026 --> 16:59.386
It's a coincidence,
I was just about to call Oliver.

16:59.388 --> 17:01.067
I heard there was an issue
at the prom shoot.

17:01.069 --> 17:03.029
Right, yes.
Unfortunately, we walked

17:03.031 --> 17:04.391
right into some model drama.

17:04.393 --> 17:07.073
Oh.
And Oliver didn't step in?

17:07.075 --> 17:08.555
I tried to fix it.

17:08.557 --> 17:09.756
Lesson learned.
Don't be a hero.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.358
Especially when there's

17:11.359 --> 17:12.559
tens of thousands
of dollars at stake.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.119
Yes.

17:14.122 --> 17:16.563
Um, Oliver and I are...
are working on it.

17:16.565 --> 17:19.125
Good, because
I have eight pages

17:19.127 --> 17:21.407
that need to be filled
by tomorrow, midnight.

17:24.492 --> 17:27.093
- And our car is here.
- I'll be right down.

17:28.336 --> 17:29.656
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:29.658 --> 17:31.497
Yeah, I got it.

17:31.499 --> 17:33.780
Um, I'm gonna go get
some coffee.

17:33.782 --> 17:35.181
I'm probably gonna be here
late tonight.

17:35.183 --> 17:36.663
All right, well,
I'll be waiting up

17:36.665 --> 17:38.544
with a ice-cold martini for you.

17:38.546 --> 17:40.546
You're number one.

17:44.112 --> 17:45.792
Hey.

17:45.794 --> 17:47.433
Skinny latte with cinnamon.

17:47.435 --> 17:50.078
Extra sweet, just like you.

17:53.121 --> 17:55.561
Well, I'm sure you've heard
by now that the photo shoot

17:55.563 --> 17:57.283
was a little bumpy.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.405
I heard.

17:59.407 --> 18:02.688
Well, I checked, and
since the model walked off,

18:02.690 --> 18:05.451
the agency has to offer
a replacement at no cost,

18:05.453 --> 18:07.573
and I figured we could
use an up-and-coming

18:07.575 --> 18:09.535
make-up artist to save
a little bit of money there...

18:09.537 --> 18:11.539
Sounds good.

18:13.461 --> 18:15.661
Actually, it's not great.

18:15.663 --> 18:18.504
- Jacqueline was pretty upset.
- Well, it came up unplanned.

18:18.506 --> 18:22.510
So, um, it's handled.

18:23.631 --> 18:25.711
I'm gone for the day.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.192
You're leaving again?

18:27.194 --> 18:28.634
Where are you going?

18:28.636 --> 18:31.236
I'm going out, Sutton.

18:31.238 --> 18:32.798
Stop asking where.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.802
Out.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.723
I'm sorry.

18:39.446 --> 18:41.727
Look...

18:41.729 --> 18:44.650
photo shoots sometimes implode.

18:44.652 --> 18:46.732
We're allowed a misstep
every now and then.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.294
Just get the shoot done

18:49.296 --> 18:51.456
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
get me the proofs to approve

18:51.458 --> 18:54.659
by 8:00 p.m., or those photos
won't make the issue's close.

18:54.661 --> 18:56.581
Neither of us need that.

19:03.550 --> 19:06.191
So my lawyer said
before trying an injunction

19:06.193 --> 19:07.392
I should talk
to my city councilman,

19:07.394 --> 19:08.713
see if you can help.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.675
The Wild Susan
is a really important bar.

19:10.677 --> 19:13.238
It is, and I am committed

19:13.240 --> 19:14.679
to District 1
remaining inclusive

19:14.681 --> 19:16.241
for our queer community.

19:16.243 --> 19:18.203
That's great.

19:18.205 --> 19:21.566
- But I'm not sure I can help.
- Really?

19:21.568 --> 19:24.689
Look, I'll admit the fines
are onerous and unfortunate,

19:24.691 --> 19:26.851
but I can't have scofflaws.

19:26.853 --> 19:28.573
And every penny
that we don't collect is

19:28.575 --> 19:30.535
a penny we don't have
for necessary social services

19:30.537 --> 19:32.537
- that improve this district.
- Well, sure,

19:32.539 --> 19:34.218
but there's gotta be
something they can do.

19:34.220 --> 19:37.702
Yeah,
come up with the $42,000.

19:37.704 --> 19:40.384
Other than that, I'm sorry.

19:40.386 --> 19:42.388
It's really the best I can do.

19:45.271 --> 19:49.714
How do we raise $42,000
for the Wild Susan in one week?

19:49.716 --> 19:52.396
Um, crowdfunding.

19:52.398 --> 19:54.598
You know, the first
five people to put money in

19:54.600 --> 19:57.321
get free drinks forever.

19:57.323 --> 19:59.884
Hey.
I am back from being prodded.

19:59.886 --> 20:02.927
- That romance faded quickly.
- No, Dr. Kelso.

20:02.929 --> 20:04.809
- Oh.
- I got my ovaries checked.

20:04.811 --> 20:07.211
- And we're all good.
- Good.

20:07.213 --> 20:09.333
Did your, uh, writing partner
happen to join you?

20:09.335 --> 20:11.375
He did not.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.377
Look, I don't care
what Patrick assigned us.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.818
There's some lines
I'm not willing to cross,

20:14.820 --> 20:16.620
and having my boyfriend witness

20:16.622 --> 20:18.942
my trans-vaginal ultrasound
is one of them.

20:18.944 --> 20:21.265
- Also pooping.
- Speaking of shit.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.946
I think something's
going on with Oliver.

20:22.948 --> 20:25.589
He's been, like, totally out of
it with this photo shoot thing.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.271
And at first I thought
it was because

20:27.273 --> 20:28.952
he hated his prom, you know?

20:28.954 --> 20:30.954
Just being gay in the '90s
in Oklahoma.

20:30.956 --> 20:33.437
- Oliver hated his prom.
- Yeah, I guess so.

20:33.439 --> 20:35.759
Anyway, then he snapped at me,
which was very strange.

20:35.761 --> 20:37.321
He's never done that before.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.603
I bet he felt like
he didn't belong.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.365
At his prom?
Maybe.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.647
I'd redo that night if I could.

20:43.649 --> 20:45.649
- I think a lot of people would.
- You guys,

20:45.651 --> 20:49.292
what if we threw a prom
at the Wild Susan?

20:49.294 --> 20:51.535
Except it's-it's like a...
a charity event.

20:51.537 --> 20:54.377
We charge admission,
we get donations,

20:54.379 --> 20:56.660
we invite a bunch of people
with a lot of coins.

20:56.662 --> 20:58.782
I love that.
We have so many prom dresses

20:58.784 --> 21:00.383
and so many prom decorations.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.866
- Let's do prom.
- Not just any prom.

21:02.868 --> 21:04.547
Queer prom.

21:11.081 --> 21:12.911
Oh, man.

21:12.913 --> 21:14.969
I'm gonna be late
because I can't find anything

21:14.971 --> 21:17.444
and I have to be at work early
for this prom re-shoot.

21:17.446 --> 21:19.284
I thought Oliver hated
morning shoots.

21:19.286 --> 21:22.088
- "Eye-bags."
- He does, but I'm taking over

21:22.090 --> 21:24.047
- this shoot, so...
- Really?

21:24.049 --> 21:25.568
After what happened
the other day,

21:25.570 --> 21:27.570
doesn't that seem
a little irresponsible?

21:27.572 --> 21:29.812
- Richard...
- Because it kind of does to me.

21:29.814 --> 21:33.496
- I have it handled.
- Okay.

21:33.498 --> 21:34.657
Hey, you wanna
get dinner tonight?

21:34.659 --> 21:35.818
Wanna go to a lesbian bar?

21:35.820 --> 21:38.541
Kat is organizing a fundraiser

21:38.543 --> 21:41.504
to save the place from closing,
and also it just happens

21:41.506 --> 21:42.905
to be prom themed.

21:42.907 --> 21:44.907
So I would be
your prom date?

21:44.909 --> 21:46.469
Yeah.

21:49.394 --> 21:51.394
Mm.

21:51.396 --> 21:52.755
- Oh.
- What?

21:52.757 --> 21:54.316
You know what else
I don't have?

21:54.318 --> 21:56.318
- What?
- Underwear.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.720
Oh, I know, you don't
need 'em right now...

21:57.722 --> 22:00.082
No, I don't have
any clean underwear.

22:00.084 --> 22:01.724
- Oh.
- Which is fine, 'cause

22:01.726 --> 22:03.005
- I'm doing laundry tonight.
- Sutton, this is stupid.

22:03.007 --> 22:04.727
- Just let Fra...
- It's fine.

22:04.729 --> 22:06.328
I'm gonna do laundry tonight.

22:09.573 --> 22:12.094
Have fun.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.710
- Hi.
- Hi, you're early.

22:28.712 --> 22:29.751
Mm-hmm.
Just wanted to get a head start

22:29.753 --> 22:30.913
- on the day.
- Wow.

22:30.915 --> 22:32.474
You're still
on laundry strike?

22:32.476 --> 22:33.956
Yeah, and I'm sorry,
but I can't

22:33.958 --> 22:35.397
just become a person
who has who has a maid.

22:35.399 --> 22:36.678
Yeah, that's great.
I've now seen

22:36.680 --> 22:38.040
both of my best friends'
vaginas.

22:38.042 --> 22:39.641
What?
No, this is long enough.

22:39.643 --> 22:41.763
And with backlighting,
completely sheer.

22:41.765 --> 22:43.965
Trust me, Landing Strip,

22:43.967 --> 22:45.727
we're gonna go
to the fashion closet

22:45.729 --> 22:47.409
- and get you some underwear.
- Okay.

22:47.411 --> 22:49.451
Yep, we're good.

22:54.578 --> 22:56.458
Hey, who do we have covering
the Fenty roll-out?

22:56.460 --> 22:58.540
That would be Angie,
or she might actually kill me.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.941
- Yeah, I could see that.
- Yeah.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.983
Hey, um, I've decided

23:01.985 --> 23:04.626
to host a fundraiser
for Wild Susan.

23:04.628 --> 23:06.588
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.470
I was just wondering,
do you think it would be okay

23:08.472 --> 23:10.071
if I tweet about it
from the "Scarlet" account?

23:10.073 --> 23:13.434
Mm.
Fundraiser for a bar.

23:13.436 --> 23:15.797
I think that might be a gray
area for Safford Publications.

23:15.799 --> 23:18.800
Well, it's a queer prom
for anyone and everyone

23:18.802 --> 23:21.162
who feels like they missed out
or wants a do-over.

23:21.164 --> 23:23.484
And gray can very easily
become black and white.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.926
You can totally
tweet about that.

23:24.928 --> 23:26.647
- Thank you.
- Jacqueline,

23:26.649 --> 23:28.890
Kat's hosting a queer prom
fundraiser.

23:28.892 --> 23:31.773
You should totally come.
You'd get a kick out of that.

23:31.775 --> 23:33.494
- That sounds fun.
- Oh, my God,

23:33.496 --> 23:35.456
You know who would love this
is Sasha Velour.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.898
Oh, yes.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.739
She was a winner
on "RuPaul's Drag Race."

23:38.741 --> 23:40.101
So smart, sexy.

23:40.103 --> 23:41.742
She really is
the perfect person to launch

23:41.744 --> 23:43.944
- our date-night column.
- Oh, yeah.

23:43.946 --> 23:46.587
I'm familiar with
"RuPaul's Drag Race."

23:46.589 --> 23:48.189
Really?

23:48.191 --> 23:50.111
If you need any help.

23:50.113 --> 23:52.913
Oh, that's sweet,
but I got this.

23:54.677 --> 23:56.877
He's very passionate.

23:56.879 --> 23:58.879
- Indeed he is.
- Yeah.

24:00.723 --> 24:03.003
That shoot went pretty good,
but still no Oliver?

24:03.005 --> 24:04.565
Nope.

24:04.567 --> 24:06.166
I need an approved
PO number now

24:06.168 --> 24:08.449
- or I'm getting paid in 2020.
- Okay.

24:16.579 --> 24:18.539
Oh, my God.

24:19.902 --> 24:22.703
I am really worried
about Oliver.

24:22.705 --> 24:25.465
Something's definitely going on.

24:25.467 --> 24:27.828
It's Oliver.
He's a rock.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.030
- Rocks crumble, Jane.
- I don't think they do.

24:30.032 --> 24:31.231
Where do you think
sand comes from?

24:31.233 --> 24:32.873
The beach.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.035
Who cares?
It's Oliver.

24:35.037 --> 24:38.678
These queer prom dresses
are great. ROYGBIV.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.641
Anyway, I found court papers
on Oliver's desk.

24:41.643 --> 24:43.723
Wow. What for?

24:43.725 --> 24:45.886
Well, I didn't want to be
nosey... er than I was being.

24:45.888 --> 24:48.528
The thing is, Richard knows
something is wrong,

24:48.530 --> 24:50.490
and he wants to talk to me
about Oliver,

24:50.492 --> 24:52.652
and I want to talk to him
because he's my boyfriend,

24:52.654 --> 24:55.535
but then I remember that Oliver
is a "Scarlet" employee

24:55.537 --> 24:57.937
and Richard's
a board member, and...

24:57.939 --> 24:59.619
Hasn't that always
been true, though?

24:59.621 --> 25:01.501
Yeah, but ever since
we moved in together

25:01.503 --> 25:03.062
things have changed.

25:03.064 --> 25:06.186
The boundaries are blurry.

25:06.188 --> 25:07.707
- People knock now?
- I like it.

25:07.709 --> 25:08.948
People are starting
to pick up on the fact

25:08.950 --> 25:10.029
that this is our room.

25:10.031 --> 25:11.831
- Mm-hmm.
- Who is it?

25:11.833 --> 25:14.674
It's Ryan.

25:14.676 --> 25:17.677
Come in.

25:17.679 --> 25:19.679
Hi, ladies.

25:19.681 --> 25:22.562
You have a second to talk?

25:22.564 --> 25:25.925
So, did you visit the doctor
after we met yesterday?

25:25.927 --> 25:27.927
'Cause, uh, I've been doing
some research,

25:27.929 --> 25:29.569
and from everything that
I've read, you're supposed to

25:29.571 --> 25:32.612
go every other day
to monitor the egg growth.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.293
- I did.
- Really?

25:34.295 --> 25:36.295
After we decided to
write the article together?

25:36.297 --> 25:37.937
Um, after Patrick decided

25:37.939 --> 25:40.059
and you hopped on the bandwagon.

25:40.061 --> 25:41.580
Okay, I thought
it would be fun.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.823
My egg-freezing
is not fun for me.

25:43.825 --> 25:45.584
That's not what I meant.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.306
I... why do I feel like
you're hiding this from me?

25:47.308 --> 25:49.871
Because I am.

25:54.635 --> 25:56.916
I just did this.

25:56.918 --> 25:59.158
I let Ben get involved
in all this medical stuff

25:59.160 --> 26:01.840
and it became a huge part
of our relationship,

26:01.842 --> 26:04.043
and it ruined everything.
I don't want that with you.

26:04.045 --> 26:06.125
Jane, you're going
through something right now.

26:06.127 --> 26:07.126
What do you expect me to do?
Just ignore it?

26:07.128 --> 26:08.887
Yes.

26:08.889 --> 26:10.969
I appreciate
everything you're doing,

26:10.971 --> 26:12.331
but this is about me.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.092
It has nothing to do
with you right now.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.134
Yeah, except
I'm dating you right now,

26:16.136 --> 26:17.656
and I told you I want
to be involved.

26:17.658 --> 26:19.700
I don't want you involved.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.824
I'm just trying
to keep things with us

26:25.826 --> 26:28.026
from getting heavy and weird,
okay?

26:28.028 --> 26:29.788
Right.

26:29.790 --> 26:31.950
I don't think it's working.

26:31.952 --> 26:33.672
I gotta go.

26:49.685 --> 26:51.324
<i>Entre.</i>

26:53.408 --> 26:54.888
- Hi!
- Hey!

26:54.890 --> 26:57.250
- Welcome to queer prom.
- Gay prom!

26:57.252 --> 26:59.813
- Whoo!
- You guys look amazing.

26:59.815 --> 27:02.015
- Look at this bowtie.
- Wow, is that velvet?

27:02.017 --> 27:04.017
- Yes, it is.
- You'll almost fit in.

27:04.019 --> 27:05.738
- How's it going?
- It's good.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.420
You know, got a good turn-out,

27:07.422 --> 27:08.902
I'm wearing this dress that
feels

27:08.904 --> 27:09.903
the correct amount of extra.

27:09.905 --> 27:11.344
- Whoo!
- Okay.

27:11.346 --> 27:14.307
And... oh, uh,
Patrick didn't end up getting

27:14.309 --> 27:16.029
Sasha Velour, which was
kind of disappointing, but...

27:16.031 --> 27:18.231
- Mm.
- If you, uh, direct

27:18.233 --> 27:20.753
your attention
to the vagina thermometer.

27:20.755 --> 27:22.755
- Wow!
- The night is young.

27:22.757 --> 27:24.437
I would also like
to say hello

27:24.439 --> 27:27.880
to my best friend's boyfriend,
who has a lot of coins.

27:27.882 --> 27:29.122
Right.

27:29.124 --> 27:30.403
You can donate!
It's a worthy cause.

27:30.405 --> 27:31.884
Okay, okay, sure.
There.

27:31.886 --> 27:33.406
- Hey!
- Hey...

27:33.408 --> 27:35.087
- And that's...
- Wow, Richie Rich.

27:35.089 --> 27:37.049
You guys are all worth it.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.771
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:38.773 --> 27:40.933
- Come on, get in here.
- All right.

27:40.935 --> 27:43.095
- Please, enter.
- Jane.

27:43.097 --> 27:45.378
- Why are you sad?
- Oh, well, you know, it's prom

27:45.380 --> 27:48.260
but I can't sneak any booze

27:48.262 --> 27:50.783
and I have to leave early
to take hormones, so...

27:50.785 --> 27:52.785
- You know what you should do?
- What?

27:52.787 --> 27:54.907
Dance, baby!
Come on!

27:54.909 --> 27:56.308
Come with me!
Come on, let's go!

28:08.803 --> 28:11.764
Oh, it makes me so happy.

28:20.054 --> 28:22.895
Oh, come on.

28:22.897 --> 28:24.776
What?

28:24.778 --> 28:27.379
The only thing that Oliver
has to do is approve the photos

28:27.381 --> 28:30.262
I already sent him
to make this month's cover.

28:30.264 --> 28:32.424
- And he hasn't?
- I'm really sorry,

28:32.426 --> 28:34.266
but I'm gonna have
to go deal with this right now.

28:34.268 --> 28:35.827
Sutton, come on,
this is getting ridiculous.

28:35.829 --> 28:36.988
Just tell me what's going on.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.110
Richard,
you know that I can't.

28:38.112 --> 28:40.512
I gotta go.

28:53.847 --> 28:55.367
Club soda?

28:55.369 --> 28:57.489
Yay.

28:59.453 --> 29:01.412
So, prom.

29:01.414 --> 29:03.495
Let me guess, you went
to yours middle fingers up...

29:03.497 --> 29:05.336
And you were Prom King.

29:05.338 --> 29:07.859
I actually skipped my prom

29:07.861 --> 29:10.862
to stay home with my mother and
watch reruns of "Full House."

29:10.864 --> 29:13.504
I, uh, didn't have a boyfriend
or girlfriend in high school.

29:13.506 --> 29:14.866
I guess I could have gone
with friends,

29:14.868 --> 29:17.188
but I decided to play it safe.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.190
I have been known
to get in my way sometimes.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.913
What about you?

29:21.915 --> 29:23.995
Uh, my prom was great.

29:23.997 --> 29:25.997
I, uh, planned the whole thing

29:25.999 --> 29:28.119
all the way down
to the soundtrack

29:28.121 --> 29:29.881
I lost my virginity to.

29:29.883 --> 29:32.563
Oh, that's amazing.

29:32.565 --> 29:35.566
It was, on paper.

29:38.051 --> 29:39.930
I wasn't into
my boyfriend anymore

29:39.932 --> 29:42.173
but I didn't want to
admit it to myself.

29:42.175 --> 29:45.936
And I chose my dream dress
but it was itchy and hot,

29:45.938 --> 29:48.058
so none of it was real.

29:48.060 --> 29:53.063
And I kind of wish it was.

29:53.065 --> 29:57.828
Uh, I think I screwed things up
with Ryan, so...

29:57.830 --> 30:01.714
I'll get you that article, it
just might take a little while.

30:03.596 --> 30:05.195
Jane.

30:09.602 --> 30:11.441
Oh, my God.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.443
Okay, I am rolling,

30:13.445 --> 30:16.567
so it's possible that
I am conjuring this,

30:16.569 --> 30:18.609
but did Sasha Velour
just come to prom?

30:18.611 --> 30:20.530
- Oh, my God. It's Sasha.
- I can't believe she's here.

30:20.532 --> 30:21.852
Hi, I'm Kat.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.613
Yeah, that's her.

30:23.615 --> 30:25.215
Wait, you're rolling?

30:25.217 --> 30:27.217
Thank you so much for coming.

30:27.219 --> 30:28.458
What is happening?
Is... is Jacqueline

30:28.460 --> 30:30.620
really friends with Sasha?

30:30.622 --> 30:32.983
Jacqueline's friends
with everyone.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.473
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

30:43.475 --> 30:46.876
I'm fertility Cinderella,
so I've gotta go.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.439
Oh, your injection.
I was supposed to do that.

30:49.441 --> 30:51.121
Oh, no, I can do it myself.
It's fine.

30:51.123 --> 30:53.643
Hey, what you did here
is really amazing.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.126
Thanks. You know, I've
been so in my feelings lately.

30:56.128 --> 30:58.648
It feels good
to channel my energy

30:58.650 --> 31:00.450
into something that
really matters, you know?

31:00.452 --> 31:02.452
- I'm proud of you.
- Hey.

31:05.457 --> 31:07.657
- Oh, is that the councilman?
- Yeah.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.979
Well, that's a good sign
that he came, right?

31:09.981 --> 31:11.421
Yeah.

31:11.423 --> 31:12.942
All right, good luck.

31:12.944 --> 31:14.664
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.160
Good lord, what's happening?

31:31.162 --> 31:33.002
You would know if
you responded to my texts.

31:33.004 --> 31:36.047
- What are you doing here, Red?
- We need to talk.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.527
All right.

31:38.529 --> 31:41.330
Well, my guests
are just leaving.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.372
See you later, Carly.

31:43.374 --> 31:45.694
Aww...

31:47.378 --> 31:49.538
- Mm...
- Bye, Ollie.

32:13.639 --> 32:16.480
These look good, by the way.

32:16.482 --> 32:18.484
Thank you.

32:22.248 --> 32:26.169
So you're probably wondering
who that was.

32:26.171 --> 32:28.171
Her name is Carly,

32:28.173 --> 32:31.294
and she's the daughter
of an old friend.

32:31.296 --> 32:32.976
A boyfriend.

32:32.978 --> 32:34.978
We lived together for six years,

32:34.980 --> 32:36.460
and three of them
were with Carly.

32:36.462 --> 32:39.983
So, you're like her dad?

32:39.985 --> 32:42.025
I taught her how
to rollerblade,

32:42.027 --> 32:45.989
dance, accessorize...

32:45.991 --> 32:48.431
What's going on now?

32:48.433 --> 32:51.594
Uh, Jasper, my ex,

32:51.596 --> 32:54.397
used heroin before I knew him,

32:54.399 --> 32:57.200
and recently
it's gotten the best of him.

32:57.202 --> 33:00.483
Um, Carly's mom
isn't in the picture,

33:00.485 --> 33:03.526
so Carly was headed
for a group home, but

33:03.528 --> 33:05.488
I'm not having that.

33:05.490 --> 33:09.572
So you're... what?

33:09.574 --> 33:11.294
I'm applying to be
her legal guardian.

33:11.296 --> 33:13.216
And we'll see, okay?

33:13.218 --> 33:15.578
The paperwork, the vetting,
it's intense.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.580
They don't make it any easier
for a single gay black man.

33:17.582 --> 33:20.223
I bet.
Oh, Oliver...

33:20.225 --> 33:22.425
I approve.

33:22.427 --> 33:24.427
Oh, thank goodness.

33:44.449 --> 33:47.369
- Should we get a drink?
- Absolutely.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.252
Can we get
some champagne, please?

33:52.456 --> 33:55.297
- I love this.
- This is so great.

33:55.299 --> 33:56.378
Thank you.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.140
- Thank you.
- Ah.

33:58.142 --> 34:00.462
- Cheers.
- Hi, Jacqueline.

34:00.464 --> 34:02.624
Oh, Patrick.
Well, you were right.

34:02.626 --> 34:05.067
I am getting a kick
out of this prom.

34:05.069 --> 34:07.109
I just have to tell you, I...

34:07.111 --> 34:08.630
I'm, like, a huge fan.

34:08.632 --> 34:11.112
- Yeah. Just, yeah.
- Thanks.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.114
So how do you two
know each other?

34:13.117 --> 34:15.036
Oh, um...

34:15.039 --> 34:17.639
Well, I discovered
Sasha when she was performing

34:17.641 --> 34:19.641
completely unknown
in a little club

34:19.643 --> 34:21.163
right around the corner
from our apartment,

34:21.165 --> 34:22.804
and Ian and I
became superfans.

34:22.806 --> 34:25.327
I was completely broke,
but we hit it off.

34:25.329 --> 34:28.130
Turns out Sasha
is amazing with kids.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.650
She needed a job,
we needed a nanny,

34:29.652 --> 34:32.134
so she ended working for us

34:32.136 --> 34:34.135
- for two years.
- Best two years of my life.

34:34.137 --> 34:36.378
And then the world
finally discovered

34:36.380 --> 34:37.659
what we already knew.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.621
- Brilliant.
- Stop.

34:39.623 --> 34:42.344
Jacqueline told me all about
your date-night column.

34:42.346 --> 34:44.306
Sounds amazing.

34:44.308 --> 34:46.828
Come find me on the dance floor
when you're ready.

34:46.830 --> 34:48.670
See you.

34:51.675 --> 34:55.717
Well, I feel stupid

34:55.719 --> 34:58.079
saying that
I underestimated you,

34:58.081 --> 34:59.841
because you're
Jacqueline Carlyle,

34:59.843 --> 35:01.522
but I did.

35:01.524 --> 35:02.684
Puts you in good company.

35:02.686 --> 35:06.688
- We live and learn.
- We do.

35:06.690 --> 35:09.210
Okay, I'm gonna go get
that interview.

35:09.212 --> 35:11.172
Good idea.

35:23.706 --> 35:26.107
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:27.550 --> 35:30.351
What are you doing here?

35:30.353 --> 35:32.313
It's almost 10:30.

35:45.162 --> 35:48.203
So you missed hockey?

35:48.205 --> 35:50.285
I wanted to be here.

35:50.287 --> 35:52.287
In case you needed help
with your injection.

35:52.289 --> 35:54.689
And if you don't,
that's okay, too.

35:54.691 --> 35:57.452
But I pushed you away.

35:57.454 --> 36:00.174
Well, I came back.

36:00.176 --> 36:02.297
I know you said
you've tried this before

36:02.299 --> 36:06.621
and it was hard, but
you haven't tried it with me.

36:08.905 --> 36:13.147
I just really like
what we have right now.

36:13.149 --> 36:14.709
I've never felt this way
about anybody,

36:14.711 --> 36:16.911
and I wanted to protect that
so badly that

36:16.913 --> 36:19.594
I tried to
keep all the mess away.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.235
But that's dumb because

36:21.237 --> 36:23.237
that's part of it all, right?

36:23.239 --> 36:25.441
Right.

36:41.177 --> 36:43.377
Did you set an alarm
for my injection?

36:43.379 --> 36:45.579
Damn right, I did.

36:45.581 --> 36:47.421
That's so sweet, but you're
half an hour early.

36:47.423 --> 36:48.902
Oh, that's just
the first reminder.

36:48.904 --> 36:51.545
There'll be another one
at 10:30.

36:51.547 --> 36:54.188
I got you, Jane.

37:19.455 --> 37:21.735
Hey.

37:21.737 --> 37:24.658
$42,000 was a lot to ask.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.580
But you got people out here.

37:26.582 --> 37:29.422
Loud, proud,
and enjoying themselves.

37:29.424 --> 37:31.945
- Yeah.
- It's a victory.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.426
We'll we're not done yet,
so...

37:33.428 --> 37:34.708
I know.

37:34.710 --> 37:38.832
- Night, Kat.
- Night.

37:46.601 --> 37:48.481
- Councilman Reynolds.
- Hi, Kat.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.364
- So we made $20,000 tonight...
- That's good.

37:51.366 --> 37:52.765
Do you think there's any way
we can use that

37:52.767 --> 37:54.247
as partial payment,
take care of the rest

37:54.249 --> 37:55.808
- at a later date?
- I'm sorry, Kat.

37:55.810 --> 37:57.410
It doesn't work that way.

37:57.412 --> 37:59.412
- The developer's gonna put up...
- A luxury condo.

37:59.414 --> 38:00.693
Yes, I'm aware.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.455
I mean, look around.

38:02.457 --> 38:05.418
People need this space,
and they elected you,

38:05.420 --> 38:07.300
so we have to fight.

38:07.302 --> 38:10.503
I'm sure the condo plans
will include some open space.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.825
- Open space?
- Yeah.

38:12.827 --> 38:15.908
In a luxury condo?
What does that even mean?

38:15.910 --> 38:19.952
Think of it like a park.

38:19.954 --> 38:23.275
Right.
You really don't care, do you?

38:23.277 --> 38:25.478
I mean you act like you do,
you love a photo-op...

38:25.480 --> 38:28.000
but when it comes
to actually taking care of

38:28.002 --> 38:29.522
the interests of
the people that live here,

38:29.524 --> 38:30.803
you really don't give a shit.

38:30.805 --> 38:32.725
I'm sorry
you feel that way, Kat.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.927
What people like you
see as gentrification,

38:34.929 --> 38:37.489
I see as
neighborhood improvement.

38:37.491 --> 38:38.731
Mm.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.013
But I admire your passion.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.354
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:00.794 --> 39:03.557
- Did you do my laundry?
- I did.

39:04.838 --> 39:07.079
I get that moving in

39:07.081 --> 39:09.481
is a big adjustment,
and if you're not ready

39:09.483 --> 39:11.002
to have a housekeeper
do your laundry,

39:11.004 --> 39:13.525
let me help you.

39:13.527 --> 39:15.807
- I'm shocked.
- Not only do I know how

39:15.809 --> 39:18.089
to do it, I'm real good at it.

39:18.091 --> 39:20.011
I did a ton of laundry
when I was a kid.

39:20.013 --> 39:22.093
What? I thought
your family had a whole staff.

39:22.095 --> 39:24.055
Yeah, but at boarding school

39:24.057 --> 39:26.097
if you wanted clean clothes
you did laundry,

39:26.099 --> 39:27.579
and I picked up a lot of tips.

39:27.581 --> 39:29.381
For instance,
hot water doesn't get

39:29.383 --> 39:32.424
your clothes cleaner,
it just fades the colors.

39:32.426 --> 39:34.105
Wow.
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

39:34.107 --> 39:35.867
Okay, let me ask you this:
Did they also make you

39:35.869 --> 39:36.948
hose down the yachts
after sailing?

39:40.433 --> 39:42.994
But seriously, if I smell
fabric softener on you,

39:42.996 --> 39:44.676
you're out,
because that stuff's the worst.

39:44.678 --> 39:48.399
Wow, I am learning
so much about laundry, and you.

39:53.446 --> 39:55.606
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:56.970 --> 39:58.689
I'm sorry that
I've been weird

39:58.691 --> 40:00.611
about work stuff.

40:00.613 --> 40:02.573
I wanna tell you everything.

40:02.575 --> 40:05.376
I just feel kind of like I'm...

40:05.378 --> 40:07.018
betraying Oliver if I do.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.060
And why is this happening now?

40:09.062 --> 40:12.023
I think 'cause
we live together now.

40:12.025 --> 40:14.385
Okay, well, from now on

40:14.387 --> 40:18.629
when we're in this space,
in our home,

40:18.631 --> 40:20.111
I'm not Richard from the board.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.113
I'm just your boyfriend.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.994
Okay.

40:23.996 --> 40:25.636
- You can be Richie.
- No, never Richie.

40:25.638 --> 40:27.037
Nope.

40:27.039 --> 40:29.119
- You could be Dick.
- Don't you dare.

40:31.123 --> 40:33.404
Ricardo.

40:33.406 --> 40:35.085
I can work with that.

40:35.087 --> 40:36.647
Okay, come here then,
why don't you go ahead

40:36.649 --> 40:38.849
and tell Ricardo...

40:38.851 --> 40:41.091
- how was your day?
- Well...

40:41.093 --> 40:42.973
it was pretty incredible.

40:42.975 --> 40:45.496
- Do tell.
- Yeah.

40:45.498 --> 40:47.057
<i>Could talk about
how messy it gets</i>

40:47.059 --> 40:49.139
when all of the
kind of health stuff

40:49.141 --> 40:51.021
- started happening.
- Absolutely.

40:51.023 --> 40:53.023
So how that got kind of messy

40:53.025 --> 40:54.865
and awkward and weird and...

40:56.589 --> 40:58.669
Move.
I want to write.

41:23.455 --> 41:25.695
- I don't want to hurt you.
- It's fine.

41:31.583 --> 41:33.223
- Ow!
- Oh, my God!

41:37.629 --> 41:39.789
That is not funny.
