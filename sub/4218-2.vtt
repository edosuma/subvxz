WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.295
Back out!
Get down!

00:06.006 --> 00:07.715
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:07.883 --> 00:09.884
Casey, you shouldn't have put
Andy through the window.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.470
You know what?
I'm getting real tired
of your bull, Severide.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.180
I don't give a damn
what you're tired of.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.140
Hey! This animosity...
It's gotta stop.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.642
I cleaned out Darden's locker.

00:17.810 --> 00:21.020
Fourteen years at this station
and it all fits into a box.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.647
Kelly.

00:25.943 --> 00:26.984
Damn it, I hit the heart.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.569
Back it out, slowly.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.862
Which one of you put a needle
in the girl's heart?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.114
I did what I had to do.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.449
Do you know who
your union rep is?
What?

00:33.617 --> 00:35.660
Listen, some of us are
going over to Buzzard's
tomorrow night

00:35.828 --> 00:37.078
if you and Hallie
want to come...

00:37.246 --> 00:39.205
We would, but we do a
date night thing.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.790
Sounds nice.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.376
I'm a resident. I cannot
start a family right now.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.086
That's been made
perfectly clear.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.216
Herrmann...
You and me to the top floor
and work our way down.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.510
Ah!

00:52.678 --> 00:54.595
He's probably got
other internal damage.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.305
Just do it.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.604
Okay, guys. I'll get you
whatever you want, okay?

01:03.772 --> 01:04.856
Heather...
Hi, Kelly!

01:05.023 --> 01:06.941
Hey! Hey, guys!

01:07.109 --> 01:09.193
Okay. Okay, kids, let's go in.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.990
Hey. How're you doing?

01:14.158 --> 01:15.742
I'm good, Kelly.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.953
I gotta go in.
Uh. Hey, wait...

01:20.456 --> 01:22.874
I've been meaning
to come by...
Save it. Really.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.419
Come on. Andy and I were...

01:26.587 --> 01:28.546
Stop. Right there.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.300
Andy never even would
have been a firefighter
if it weren't for you.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.818
I'm gonna tear you apart,
knucklehead! Look at this!

01:50.986 --> 01:52.820
You know what
time it is?

01:52.988 --> 01:55.406
You wanna play
Mr. Flamethrower, huh?

01:55.574 --> 01:58.075
What y'all looking at?
You gonna pay for it.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.952
You know what? You in
a world of trouble now.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.039
Smells like a grease fire.
We'll bring the ANSULs.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.166
Up on the roof, ready to
vent, just in case.
Okay.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.587
Ma'am...
You kind of thick, ain't you?

02:09.755 --> 02:12.882
Let 'em in, idiot!
After all I gone through...

02:19.389 --> 02:21.098
Sir! You gotta move
out of here.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.435
That's it?
Hit it.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.937
Anything to piss
off the engine...

02:31.902 --> 02:34.153
Come on, buddy.
You gotta go.
I can't.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.031
I'm not asking...
My hotplate caught on fire.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.701
My landlord'll kill me.
I got no place to go.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.038
I can't go.
I can't, I can't...

02:53.841 --> 02:55.633
Ma'am. Is this your place?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.301
You damn right it is.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.095
Is that your microwave
down in the basement?

02:59.263 --> 03:00.888
Oh, what of it?

03:01.056 --> 03:03.850
Frayed electric cord
that started this.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.019
The place would've
burned to the ground
if not for this man.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.729
He's a hero.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.566
Sir, I just want to say

03:11.733 --> 03:13.526
I've never seen a
civilian act so bravely.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.076
Get over here.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.871
I was so worried about you.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.624
Yo, fool! That's not
what we taught you!

03:29.626 --> 03:31.252
Hey! Candidate!

03:31.420 --> 03:34.589
One hand on the beam,
Candidate! I don't care if
you're carrying a damn cow!

03:34.756 --> 03:37.341
Men die when they relax.
Okay, Kelly.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.427
He gets it.
Yeah, he better!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.645
He's right. Hand on the
beam, no matter what.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.147
Yeah, okay.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.569
Next Wednesday, can you
take a shift for me?

03:57.487 --> 03:58.696
Yeah.
I have a thing.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.407
Yeah.
Okay. Great, great.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.411
Hey.
Hey.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.998
I need something.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.760
It's the last one.
Yeah...

04:20.928 --> 04:22.845
I mean it.
Right. It's all good.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
What's with the goat?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.701
What?

04:45.869 --> 04:49.246
The Truck 81 seal or
symbol or whatever
it's called, it's a goat.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.790
It's a fighting goat.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.750
Yeah, but they've
got Cerberus,

04:52.918 --> 04:54.877
the three-headed dog that
guards the gates of hell.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.879
We got a freaking goat.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.388
Morning.
Morning.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.974
Hey, how are the
Darden kids doing?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.977
You talked to Heather at all?
Uh, yeah.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.604
As good as can be
expected, I suppose.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.815
You seen 'em?
Yeah.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.359
I hear they're coming
to the barbecue.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.028
Good.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.084
Hey, Chief, you got
a second?
Sure, Kelly.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.129
I'm looking for a few
extra shifts this month.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.840
How's Saturday sound?
Saturday is barbecue.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.508
I've been there before.
No way.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.801
Every man on deck
on this one.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.845
Chief, I could really use
the cash...

05:46.013 --> 05:47.638
Ask me next month.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.060
Okay.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.064
Hey, hey. Check it out.

05:57.983 --> 06:01.819
Oh, yeah.
Best benefit
all year, boys.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.864
He's not lying.
We're there when
you feed us.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.575
Hey, you know about
fire fans, Peter Mills?

06:07.743 --> 06:10.703
They're chicks who follow
firemen like flies to honey.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.413
Bees, Otis. Bees to honey.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.081
Whatever. We're
still the honey.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.127
Hey, Lieutenant,
why do we have a goat
on our truck?

06:19.463 --> 06:22.214
Years ago, Truck 81's
first fire

06:22.382 --> 06:24.550
was at a goat
farm in Little Italy.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.843
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.970
Nah. They used to have
a goat at the station

06:28.138 --> 06:29.847
so they didn't have
to mow the grass.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.100
Huh. I thought that's
what candidates are for.

06:35.937 --> 06:36.896
Smoke-eater
in the house.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.439
No way.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.111
Hey! Yeah!

06:48.283 --> 06:50.451
Welcome back.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.036
Jesus, man...

06:54.539 --> 06:56.165
They ticked a nerve in my leg.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.043
I may not walk straight again.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.920
Candidate, get him a chair!

07:05.550 --> 07:07.718
Thanks, kid. Ah...

07:08.678 --> 07:11.013
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second, fellas, um...

07:12.641 --> 07:16.310
Are any of my kids
around here, or my wife
or her parents?

07:16.478 --> 07:17.770
No, why?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.355
What the hell?

07:21.566 --> 07:24.527
I'm healed! Oh, I'm healed!

07:24.694 --> 07:27.988
Must have been living with
my damn in-laws that was
breaking me down!

07:30.075 --> 07:32.618
All right. Not that healed.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.036
- You ready to get back?
- Yeah...

07:34.204 --> 07:36.789
Glad you're back,
Herrmann. We're a better
house with you here.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.082
Thanks, Chief.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.001
Uh, later on we're going
to have a white board session

07:41.169 --> 07:43.587
about what happened
in the Darden incident
last month.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.631
I expect you all
to be there.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.299
But on another note,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.052
this is Nicki Rutkowski.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.345
Hello.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.515
She's gonna be working
with us next month helping
out with the payroll.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.975
Her father is one
of my oldest friends.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.311
We were in the Navy together.
So you all just treat her

07:59.479 --> 08:03.107
like she's your very own...

08:03.275 --> 08:04.275
Sister.

08:05.986 --> 08:06.861
Thanks for having me.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.447
Welcome. Don't screw up
any checks. The first and
the fifteenth.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.616
Oh, I will.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.163
Accident, multiple injuries...

08:17.330 --> 08:19.373
Let's go!
Squad 3, Truck 81,

08:19.541 --> 08:21.917
Engine 51, Ambulance 61...

08:38.059 --> 08:39.643
Over in the hole!

08:41.104 --> 08:42.855
What's going on?
The foundation collapsed

08:43.023 --> 08:45.107
and there's three guys down
in the basement hole!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.861
I'm gonna need a
two-and-a-half up there.
On it.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.029
Let's go.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.330
It's over here.
They're down there.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.540
Okay.
The whole floor collapsed.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.584
We were pouring concrete for
the second and third stories

09:03.752 --> 09:05.211
and the foundation
just gave way.

09:10.300 --> 09:14.053
There's no fire. Let's drop
the two-and-a-half into
the hole from the ladder.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.429
Cruz, hurry it up!

09:26.733 --> 09:27.775
Get that hose up there.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.791
There's good.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.670
Scenario may give some more,
so let's move quickly.

09:52.842 --> 09:53.842
Now charge it.

09:59.891 --> 10:00.766
Good.

10:07.899 --> 10:08.691
Good.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.741
He's pretty banged up,
but okay. I don't think
we should move him.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.618
Dawson, you down there?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.745
Go for Dawson.
We need you up here.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.955
Come on.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.084
Shay and Dawson are on
their way down.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.758
Oh. That's a first.

10:34.926 --> 10:38.053
I'm under here!
I'm under here!

10:38.221 --> 10:41.056
Are you okay?
Can you sit up?

10:41.224 --> 10:44.226
Yeah. Peter's farther
down. I heard him talkin'.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.145
But I couldn't see him. Ah...
Take him out.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.233
Peter?

10:52.485 --> 10:53.819
I knew this was going
to be a bad day.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.156
I told my wife this
morning I had a
premonition.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.365
Are you hurt?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.909
I can't breathe.
Can't move.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.417
All right. We'll get you out.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.586
I need three pike
poles and a saw!

11:10.754 --> 11:11.795
Right away, Lieutenant!

11:14.341 --> 11:16.342
Ready to bring him up?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.511
Argh...

11:23.516 --> 11:24.767
Watch it.
Okay.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.936
How you doing
down there, Peter?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.356
I've been better.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.610
I'm going in.
It's unstable.

11:34.778 --> 11:35.944
Aren't we all.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.990
Let's widen the hole,
but get ready to pull back
if this debris shifts.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.460
Message received.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.262
Not so bad, right?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.359
It's Peter, right?

12:16.778 --> 12:17.945
Can you move your foot?

12:18.113 --> 12:21.073
No. I haven't even felt
it for half an hour.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.369
Uh!

12:27.414 --> 12:28.872
How about the
rest of you?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.332
Can't breathe too good.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.131
Oh! Oh!
Okay. Okay...

12:37.298 --> 12:39.550
Just... Just get my
foot out. I'll be fine.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.427
All right, we're gonna get
you out of here.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.140
Do me one favor.
Yeah?

12:47.559 --> 12:48.684
No lies.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.772
Fair enough. I think
you're bleeding on the inside.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.566
Your foot is the
least of your problems.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.445
Casey! We need
this hole opened up.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.363
On it! You go, Cruz.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.297
Hang on. We'll get you
back to your wife in no time.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.090
Yeah, sure.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.842
Are you saying I got a
bad poker face?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.969
I'm saying I'd be all
in on that one.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.138
Well, you're breathing
and talking, so that's good.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.309
Hold on!

13:32.645 --> 13:34.521
Severide?
Yeah, fine.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.523
Get Dawson over here!

13:36.691 --> 13:37.691
Dawson!

13:41.070 --> 13:43.530
Here.
His lower leg is trapped
and there's internal bleeding.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.116
There's no way to release it?
No.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.536
Other than that,
everything's peachy.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.206
Okay, I'll call for
a trauma surgeon.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.791
How long?
I don't know.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.962
And what would a trauma
surgeon do that you couldn't?

14:00.840 --> 14:01.840
Take off your foot.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.345
This is Ambulance 61
on Med Channel 5.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.763
Go Ambulance 61.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.349
We need a trauma surgeon
for a possible amputation...

14:10.517 --> 14:13.685
Copy that, 61.
Standby while
I send to trauma.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.108
Ooh! Uh!
I got you!

14:22.070 --> 14:23.195
What's your name?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.572
Severide. Kelly.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.574
Everyone pretty much
calls me Severide.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.994
Kelly. You married, Kelly?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.622
No.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.123
Don't wait too long.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.710
My wife's name is Georgie.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.381
Her dad wanted a boy,
but he kept getting girls.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.341
There was a...

14:44.509 --> 14:47.386
A barbershop on my
street named
Harris and Sons...

14:47.554 --> 14:50.889
Mr. Harris named
it when his wife was
pregnant with their first.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.767
Ended up having
five girls.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.936
Easy.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.235
Severide, find a vein and
get this saline into him.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.529
How long on that surgeon?
Fifteen minutes.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.407
Kelly...
Yeah.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.120
We don't have time
for a surgeon. You're
gonna have to do it.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.959
Take off the foot,
get me out of here,
get me home.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.298
Tell that surgeon
to hurry the
hell up!

15:24.465 --> 15:27.259
Chopper him here
if you have to!
Negative, 61.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.219
The trauma surgeon's
already en route.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.725
You all right?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.728
Severide. We need to pull
back. It's gonna give.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.691
He's right.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.651
Go.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.073
Casey, I need a sawzall!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.618
Mouch! Lower me
a sawzall...

15:53.745 --> 15:54.953
Uh...
Hey, Peter...

15:55.121 --> 15:56.955
I'm just...
I'm still with you, Kelly.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.750
Tell me
about Georgie.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.756
I... I married
above my head.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.052
Been playing catch-up
ever since.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.970
Did you have children?
No.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.431
We tried.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.683
Severide.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.695
Kelly?
Yeah.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.578
You got a phone?

16:43.378 --> 16:45.504
61, your
trauma surgeon's on scene.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.508
Dawson! He's here!

16:49.676 --> 16:51.301
Trauma surgeon's
on his way down!

16:58.893 --> 17:00.560
It's a recovery now.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.622
Dawson, Shay!
Get over here.
We got something for you.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.416
Come on! Let's go! Bring
it out! Open it up!
Oh!

18:04.584 --> 18:06.835
Da, da, da, da, da, da...

18:07.003 --> 18:08.170
Hey!
Whoa.

18:08.337 --> 18:11.047
They obviously
got their artistic talent
from their mother.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.716
That's so lovely.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.011
Hey, guys! These are
the ladies who saved my life!
Come on, give 'em a clap!

18:16.179 --> 18:17.554
Yay! Yay!

18:18.848 --> 18:21.850
Thank you, guys!
Thank you. Thank you.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.779
All I'm saying is I am
more than happy to
design a new seal

18:33.946 --> 18:36.031
more reflective of
the truck we are.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.532
Anything besides a goat.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.369
What's he on about?
He doesn't like our crest.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.623
I love that goat. That
goat's all about
reversing the curse.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.708
What curse?
The Cubs.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.544
A goat owner cursed
them once which is why
they always suck.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.754
Everyone knows that.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.257
So we have
a cursed crest?

18:54.425 --> 18:56.009
How the hell
should I know?
Leave it alone.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.219
The goat rocks.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.472
Of course you
would think that.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.897
Please leave a
message after the tone.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.817
Uh...

19:14.070 --> 19:16.154
Okay, they're
good guys. Kelly.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.782
After you.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.621
Darden was entering the
attic window here,

19:24.789 --> 19:28.834
while Squad 3 was
conducting first floor
search and rescue here.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.254
Fire started in the
basement, spread up
into the kitchen.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.298
Now, we all know fire is on a
constant hunt for oxygen,

19:35.466 --> 19:38.760
which is why we cut
our vent point away
from our entry point.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.264
No vent, and the
fire's coming after us.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.267
What started in the basement
now is looking for a way out.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.689
A larger vent cut in the
back of the house

19:50.857 --> 19:52.566
and the fire never would
have made it upstairs.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.236
Kelly.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.871
Oh, Candidate. Dress
blues at the barbecue.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.956
Really?
The Commissioner's
gonna be there,

20:50.124 --> 20:52.792
along with half
the deputies and most of
the chiefs. It's a big deal.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
They cracked Herrmann
last year for
forgetting his cap.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.838
Go back and read
the poster.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.006
Full dress blues.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.012
Oh...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.018
Double crown molding?
No expense spared on that.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.062
Yeah, well,
it's getting there.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.775
You're never gonna
want to leave.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.026
All depends on
what the offer is.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.279
So what's up?

21:22.657 --> 21:24.574
I said I would bring a
dessert to the barbecue.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.786
I understand if you
don't want me to go.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.038
No, you should come.
We should go together.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.582
You sure?
Yeah.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.501
Heather Darden's
bringing the boys.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.295
Well, good.
This will be fun.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.381
I'll pick you up at 2:00.
Okay.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.974
There's Willie, our
favorite doorman.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.433
Willie!
Hey, ladies!

21:50.601 --> 21:54.020
Hey.
I should flash him next
time. I love that guy.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.814
Unprofessional.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.484
Ambulance 61,
Battery, 71 West Superior.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.945
Ambulance 61, responding.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.410
All right, all right, give us
some room. Give us some room.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.037
I'll own this crappy bar
before this is over yet!

22:11.205 --> 22:15.041
Go home. Just go back, go
back wherever you...

22:15.209 --> 22:17.669
Wherever you came from...

22:17.837 --> 22:19.796
Oh, you got a nasty
cut there.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.257
Get your hands off me!
We're with the CFD, sir,

22:22.425 --> 22:24.676
here to fix you up.
Fix me up? No! No!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.053
It's these Irish inbreds
you should be fixing up.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.930
I've got
four brothers

22:29.098 --> 22:32.017
and they're both...
They're both gonna
own this place.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.185
Hey, what happened here?
No one here saw anything.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.480
It's called a "black and tan"!

22:37.648 --> 22:39.024
It's called a "half
and half" you moron!

22:39.191 --> 22:40.275
Ireland sucks!

22:40.443 --> 22:43.653
God save our gracious Queen

22:43.821 --> 22:45.697
Long live our noble Queen
Shut up, you tosser!

22:45.865 --> 22:46.865
Oh!

22:47.033 --> 22:48.742
Let's move him now,
all right?

22:48.909 --> 22:51.161
All right, come on...
We're going, come on.
Come on, we're going!

22:51.328 --> 22:52.996
Send her victorious
Piss off!

22:53.164 --> 22:54.998
All right! Move it,
now! Move guys!

22:55.166 --> 22:57.167
Don't come back!
Piss off!

22:57.334 --> 22:58.334
Get out of here!

22:58.502 --> 23:00.211
Come on.
Come on!

23:00.379 --> 23:02.005
All right, all right. Okay...

23:02.173 --> 23:03.757
We got this.
Thank God! Have fun in there.

23:03.924 --> 23:08.094
Oh, Lord our God

23:08.262 --> 23:11.806
arise...
You gotta give it a rest
and hold still, sir.

23:11.974 --> 23:15.018
Black and tan,
black and tan,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.938
black and...
Hello, sweet cheeks.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.733
Whoa! Hey!
Get your hands off me!

23:21.901 --> 23:24.110
Whoa. Whoa.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.495
So, you gonna bring that
doctor to the barbecue?

23:33.662 --> 23:36.498
Uh... I don't know.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.584
Honestly, not every
decision has to be
an act of Congress.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.503
Just keep it simple.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.712
Yeah.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.756
Oh, did you hear about
Hallie and Casey?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.716
What? What?
Whoa.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.551
Stop it. Tell me.
What is it?

23:48.719 --> 23:51.096
Nothing. Just some rumors
running around that, uh,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.890
that maybe they're
splitting up. He's moved out.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.642
What? No. Really?

23:55.810 --> 23:56.851
It's just what I've heard.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.396
Okay. What do you think?

24:02.358 --> 24:03.733
Nice work.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.827
Wow, where'd
you find this one?

24:13.994 --> 24:16.496
Dawson was actually
making out with him

24:16.664 --> 24:18.456
and he fainted
and bumped his head.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.542
When he wakes up,
tell him I said
thanks for a great time.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.585
Uh-huh. All right.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.630
Ladies...
Speak for yourself.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.590
Hey, Hallie.
You guys going
to the barbecue?

24:27.758 --> 24:30.260
Wouldn't miss it.
Matt and I are bringing
his aunt's famous brownies.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.096
At least she always
tells me they're famous.
I will see you there.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.892
Nice intel. Thanks.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.519
Sorry.
Gabby!

24:39.687 --> 24:41.688
Mike. Hi.
How are you?

24:41.856 --> 24:43.898
I'm good.
Yeah?

24:44.066 --> 24:45.108
Good.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.822
Hey, uh, say, what are
you doing on Saturday?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.086
Hey! Lee Henry! I'm not
gonna tell you again!

25:05.254 --> 25:07.589
Put the stick down before
I beat you with it!

25:07.756 --> 25:09.632
Whoa, whoa...
Hey? What?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.719
Take it easy.
You gotta be fair
but firm.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.097
Okay...
Yeah.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.225
Whoa.
Nice. Yes!

25:19.393 --> 25:21.477
Fabulous!

25:21.645 --> 25:24.147
Howdy.
When's the parade, Candidate?

25:24.315 --> 25:26.649
Yeah, that's a good one.
Good one, Otis.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.110
Hey, you taking
collections for
the Salvation Army?

25:30.738 --> 25:32.655
Got ice cream?
That's original.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.075
Real good.
Excuse me, are you
the Captain?

25:37.494 --> 25:40.580
Uh, no, miss. He's
actually the Commissioner...

25:40.748 --> 25:42.081
No. No, no, no. I'm not.
Really?

25:42.249 --> 25:44.626
Yeah, yeah, he is.
He's the youngest one
in Chicago history.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.712
Wow.
Go show her where the beer
cooler is, Commissioner.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.380
I'd like that.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.383
All right. Right this way.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.596
Wow.
What?

25:56.764 --> 25:57.972
So you're his
wingman now?

25:59.016 --> 26:00.266
Karma.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.728
He's sittin' there

26:03.896 --> 26:06.022
With a napkin on his
face, sticking his
tongue through it.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.775
And I'm like, "Dude,
you are my favorite
12-year-old."

26:11.987 --> 26:13.821
Who would do that?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.199
What's up with you?

26:17.618 --> 26:18.868
Nothing. All good.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.123
Ahh.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.833
Oh, you and her?
Mmm-hmm.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.877
No chance.
Up yours.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.462
Hey, Corrinne.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.595
If anybody does
anything... Okay?
You got it.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.265
Yeah? You sure?
I promise.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.558
Don't trust these guys.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.607
Mind if we squeeze in?
Um, no. Of course.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.026
Hey, guys.
Um, this is Corrinne.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.821
She just moved
here from, um...
Alabama.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.406
Nice to meet you.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.993
Hey, so, I think I saw
the result of some of
your work yesterday.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.704
The lipstick, the fingernails,
that was you guys?

27:02.871 --> 27:06.374
No. Well, Dawson got
her ass squeezed by
a drunken Englishman.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.126
You've got to quit
flirting with
your patients.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.919
So we prettied
him up a little.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.671
So, not something
you learned in
med school, I take it?

27:11.839 --> 27:14.924
We're paramedics. We
didn't go to fancy
med school.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.175
Although...

27:19.680 --> 27:21.639
What?
Uh,

27:21.807 --> 27:24.100
I've been taking
pre-med classes.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.810
- Really?
- That's great.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.479
Yeah, I mean, you know,
it's a long way off.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.482
Hey, anytime you want to
walk a shift with me,
say the word.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.984
That sounds great.
Any time.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.152
Or with me.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.533
Hey, Heather's here.
Let's go say hello.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.747
Hey, Matt.
What's going on?

27:49.293 --> 27:53.046
I just... It's hard on
Ben and Griffin.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.090
They're afraid
the kids are gonna treat
them differently.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.640
Come on, squirt! We're
gonna play some football...

28:04.808 --> 28:06.309
I'm gonna get a beer.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.564
Let's get the ball.
Let's get the ball.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.240
Andy loved being
a firefighter.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.658
It was our dream
since we were kids.

28:23.911 --> 28:27.205
He worshipped you.
You sure it wasn't
just your dream?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.134
Oh, he protects Chicago
and serves the beer?

28:41.678 --> 28:43.012
For right now, sure.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.432
I'm Nicki. Thanks.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.727
How long have
you been a firefighter?

28:52.189 --> 28:53.481
Since the day I was born.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.569
Well, look,
I gotta run, Nicki.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.531
Cheers.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.828
That was really nice.
Really nice.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.705
Kids are stronger
than you think.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.545
So what's up with
the new doctor?

29:17.214 --> 29:18.172
Who, Mike?
Yeah.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.843
Oh. I don't know.
Not much. Just keeping
things simple.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.727
You, uh... You left
your jacket.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.147
Thanks.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.784
Not a good
time for this.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.619
Do you always do what
your Chief tells you to do?

29:48.787 --> 29:51.330
Trust me, this
isn't because
of the Chief.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.498
Is there somebody
else in there?

29:52.666 --> 29:53.875
Just the Cubs.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.086
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.737
Have a good day.
Yeah. You, too.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.243
Bye.
Bye, sweetie.

30:29.411 --> 30:32.413
Mmm. Mmm. See ya.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.129
Hi.
Good morning.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.467
Did you eat my yogurt?
I didn't touch your yogurt.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.727
It was good seeing
Heather yesterday.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.567
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.408
So, if there
is nothing else...
Chief?

31:09.576 --> 31:12.495
Yes, Brian.
I was wondering what
the proper protocol

31:12.663 --> 31:14.789
would be for designing
a new crest for the truck?

31:16.416 --> 31:18.834
It's just, sir,
Engine's got a camel,

31:19.002 --> 31:20.044
which I get.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.214
And Squad has got
a badass three-headed dog,

31:23.382 --> 31:27.134
which I get. And we have
a goat, sir.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.346
Named after
Billy "Goat" Bukanski,

31:30.514 --> 31:32.932
the first chief of
Firehouse 51 and
a mentor to me.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.936
Just forget
I said anything.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.273
Is that it?
Yes, sir.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.191
You all do good
work out there.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.698
That true about
the crest?

31:50.033 --> 31:53.452
...so if you would, please
give me a call me back so we
can arrange a time to talk.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.662
Thanks.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.083
You wanna smoke break?

32:00.627 --> 32:02.461
You mean you wanna
bum a cigar off me?

32:02.629 --> 32:03.963
If you're offering...

32:06.550 --> 32:08.509
If you insist.
Thank you.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.140
How was Mike?

32:15.350 --> 32:18.436
You know how when you
have a sundae, and it's
loaded up with hot fudge

32:18.604 --> 32:21.314
and whip cream
and ice cream
and a cherry on top?

32:21.481 --> 32:23.649
Yeah?
He's the spoon.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.444
Hey, you can't eat
without a spoon.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.197
What's the latest
with your union file?

32:31.241 --> 32:33.200
Uh, I don't know.
I'm ignoring it.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.536
Works for
everything else.

32:37.122 --> 32:40.666
Accident,
501 North Wabash. Truck 81,

32:40.834 --> 32:43.294
Ambulance 61, Squad 3.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.545
Can't ignore this.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.614
Look out!

33:11.782 --> 33:13.157
Ah!

33:13.325 --> 33:15.284
Get everyone back
and seal it off!

33:15.452 --> 33:16.827
Good Lord...

33:16.995 --> 33:19.997
Move back! Fast! Fast!
Get back! Come on!

33:22.292 --> 33:24.335
Oh, God...
Ma'am, hold on.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.337
Hadley, driver's side.
Start there.
Okay.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.718
My friend... My friend,
Cameron...

33:32.886 --> 33:34.679
Where is she?
She's right next to me.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.263
I can't see her. Cam!

33:46.817 --> 33:48.734
Get back!

33:58.829 --> 34:01.664
Passenger trapped,
conscious, but we had
to pull back

34:01.832 --> 34:02.790
because stuff's
still falling.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.750
That driver's door is
jammed up tight.

34:04.918 --> 34:08.212
Okay, Capp, Hadley on the
K-12, you cut the top hinge.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.172
Severide, you work the
Jaws on the bottom edge.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.633
The moment that hinge pops,
you wedge that door open.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.301
Okay, sir.
Mouch...

34:14.469 --> 34:16.554
Collar the girl and
get her on a board.
Let's go.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.708
Just lean forward for me.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.755
Yeah, go!

34:50.922 --> 34:52.923
Grab the end, Mills!
Lean up...

34:54.593 --> 34:57.636
Come down for me.
Watch your head.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.556
Uh...
Move her out now!

35:00.724 --> 35:01.807
Oh! Oh!

35:03.727 --> 35:06.562
You're okay, sweetie.
You're fine.
You're in good hands.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.230
I just dropped my phone,
so we pulled over...

35:09.191 --> 35:12.067
Please, is Cameron okay?
Is she okay?

35:12.235 --> 35:14.779
I'm not sure, honey.
Let's just concentrate
on you right now, okay?

35:14.946 --> 35:17.490
Ma'am, please.
My daughter, my daughter

35:17.657 --> 35:19.784
was in that car. Is she okay?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.535
I don't know.
They're doing what
they can...

35:21.703 --> 35:23.788
Her name is Julie.
I really don't know.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.206
She has blonde hair.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.005
She's okay.
She's right over there...

35:33.173 --> 35:35.132
Julie! That's my daughter!

35:39.763 --> 35:41.263
Good thing she
didn't say "red hair."

35:45.977 --> 35:47.102
It's okay.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.029
Hello. Yeah.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.829
Yeah, sure. If that's good
for you, I'll be there.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.875
Yeah. Okay.

36:21.763 --> 36:25.808
Hey.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.686
How was your shift?

36:30.063 --> 36:33.899
What do you
always say to me?
"Fine. Typical."

36:34.067 --> 36:35.067
Uh,

36:37.237 --> 36:39.613
I've been thinking...
Uh-oh.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.573
No, nothing like that.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.200
What is it?

36:46.830 --> 36:50.207
Today, one girl died
and another lived,

36:50.375 --> 36:53.794
because one decides
to drive, the other gets
in the passenger seat...

36:56.339 --> 36:58.841
I moved out because
we spent the last year
constantly debating

36:59.009 --> 37:01.802
your career versus
my expectations of a family.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.640
What if we simplify things,

37:07.684 --> 37:11.228
start fresh, put it all aside

37:11.396 --> 37:12.897
and live every day like
it could be the last.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.737
I'm saying I want
to be with you.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.136
Alabama.
Alabama.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.555
Gulf Coast,
the catfish
have got it.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.765
Right?
Yes!

37:47.933 --> 37:48.933
Take her.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.480
And this English guy was,
like, wearing this cape

37:54.648 --> 37:56.649
and he looked
like a fool.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.693
Hey!
Yo! What's up? What's up?

38:00.862 --> 38:02.363
Here you go. One, two.
Thank you.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.073
Absolutely.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.449
Cheers.
Cheers.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.161
Is that all you got?
Another round
for the lady, huh?

38:11.665 --> 38:13.874
It's good to see
you guys.
It's great to be here.

38:17.671 --> 38:18.921
Have you thought
about doing rounds with me?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.383
Uh, are you sure
it's not too
much trouble?

38:22.550 --> 38:23.509
Are you kidding?
I'd love it.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.719
You're already doing half
the procedures we do.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.681
That's doubtful.
Hey, you're going to make
a great doctor, trust me.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.683
You have more experience
than half of these
Ivy League clowns.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.227
Hey, this round's on me.

38:33.395 --> 38:36.146
Oh! Hey!
Put three more on there.

38:37.816 --> 38:38.816
What the hell
are you doing?

38:40.902 --> 38:42.528
What can I say?
The uniform thing works.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.535
How does that...

38:49.703 --> 38:50.744
Damn.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.497
Amy and Christine.

38:54.916 --> 38:55.916
Cheers to that.

38:56.876 --> 38:57.876
Bye, guys.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.880
Hey, the last to arrive!

39:02.048 --> 39:04.216
Perfect timing, my boys.
There we are.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.679
Cheers.
Where's Severide?

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
Is the blood off?

39:37.167 --> 39:38.876
I don't want her
to see the blood.
Here, here.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.629
There. You're good.
And my hair?

39:43.882 --> 39:47.885
I should've got it cut.
Your hair looks fine. Fine.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.312
Georgie, my love...

40:01.941 --> 40:03.609
God, I wish I were
better at this...

40:03.777 --> 40:05.277
Oh, my God.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.906
I've made a lot of promises
to you over the years.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.201
Some were harder to keep.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.996
I promised you

40:17.457 --> 40:19.208
a house in Provence.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.711
I'm sorry we never made
it there. You worked
so hard on that French.

40:24.589 --> 40:28.842
But any promise I ever
made about you,

40:30.512 --> 40:32.805
about how
you were the

40:33.890 --> 40:35.891
final piece to my puzzle.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.562
Those I kept until today.

40:40.730 --> 40:41.730
Every day.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.526
I know... I know what
you're thinking about
Kelly here

40:45.693 --> 40:47.444
'cause I thought it, too.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.447
He's exactly the son
that I pictured for us.

40:52.033 --> 40:55.119
And if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have had
this chance

40:56.913 --> 40:58.539
to say goodbye.

40:59.833 --> 41:04.128
Oh, my love, do you
remember how I made you
promise me

41:04.295 --> 41:07.005
that you'd let
me die before you?

41:11.553 --> 41:12.845
Well, thank you, my love

41:15.557 --> 41:17.975
because I couldn't live a day
in this world without you.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.687
Georgie...

41:28.778 --> 41:29.736
Mon amour.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.247
Thank you.
