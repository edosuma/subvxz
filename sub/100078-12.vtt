00:04.964 --> 00:07.341
From the looks of that rock,
I'm guessing you didn't tell Ethan.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.467
No, I didn't,

00:08.551 --> 00:10.803
and I would appreciate it
if you didn't mention it again.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.304
Mention what?

00:12.388 --> 00:15.099
I want us to try to get pregnant again.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.395
I'm proposing opening
a safe injection site at the hospital.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.773
Preventing deaths would
save the hospital money in the long run.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.984
Allow drug use on our premises?

00:25.067 --> 00:27.611
"A PR nightmare" is how I'd put it.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.197
-There's another way.
-An unsanctioned site?

00:30.448 --> 00:33.075
But they're illegal.
You could lose your license.

00:33.159 --> 00:34.368

00:34.952 --> 00:35.953
I'm in.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.917
Nah, got busy around midnight
and never let up.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.128
I did a lot of counseling,
though, and set up that rehab consult.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.464
Great. And I just heard back
from our new hookup on clean needles.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.799
Get me a Narcan inhaler.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.388
She OD'd. Hang in there.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.896

But you're gonna be all right.

Okay, Val.

Let's get you into a bed,

01:30.132 --> 01:32.051
and you know, maybe later,
we can have a talk.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.887
Okay.

You realize I could do this myself, right?

01:56.492 --> 02:00.704
True, but Dr. Patchefsky
did say IVF is a team effort.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.666
So any negative effects from the hormones?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.376
Headaches, mood swings?

Are we counting the growing urge
to pump my teammate full of hormones?

My oncologist.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.063
She says I'm not responding
to the radiation the way she'd hoped.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.191
We have to add a course
of hormone therapy.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.526
Oh, Maggie...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.238
It's fine. I guess that's how it goes.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.949
Well, I'll call someone in.
You take the day off.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.033
No, really, I'm fine.

-We got two kids in the front seat.

-It's gonna be tricky getting them out.
-Why? What's wrong?

03:23.037 --> 03:26.123

went through the windows.

were in the back.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.407

04:41.490 --> 04:43.367
Normally, I'd cut the bar
in between,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.660
but they're pinned together
pretty tight.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.786
So what do we do now?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.496
Slide her down a couple inches,
make some space?

04:47.579 --> 04:49.331
No, she's already shocky from blood loss.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.166
Moving her could shear
the vessel wide open.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.044
Just let me know what works for you.
We'll make it happen.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.546
Can you give us a moment?

04:57.381 --> 04:59.425
He's right, there is no other way
to move them.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.885
Yes, there is. We get more blood
to up their reserves,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.137
then we cut them out together.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.973
What? But we don't know where the rebar
is in Henry's neck.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.142
One wrong move and we could tear
into a vessel.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.394
Maybe, but if we slide Kate,
we'll lose her for sure.

he will do so again.

quite costly both in time and resources.

Mike may be depressed.

in the right direction

we can get him off drugs.

-How bad is it?

12:45.390 --> 12:46.683
We won't know until we lift him off.

Hey, Doc. What do you think?

13:59.297 --> 14:02.676
Well, it's tricky, you know,
because active addiction tends to mask

14:02.759 --> 14:05.470
whatever underlying pathology
might be present.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.097
Sure.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.141
I mean, he could very well
be self-medicating, but what?

14:10.725 --> 14:13.353
Is it depression, is it bipolar,
or, you know...

14:13.436 --> 14:14.437
Yeah, understood.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.523
And we can figure that out
later, but right now,

14:16.606 --> 14:18.483
a diagnosis is what's gonna save his life.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.859
It's not quite that simple, though.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.945
You understand his heart
is a ticking time bomb.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.697
Every minute we let go by

14:23.780 --> 14:25.949
increases the chances
he's gonna die right here in front of us.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.325
I wanna help him, too,

14:27.409 --> 14:29.744
but in order for the surgery
to be successful,

14:29.828 --> 14:31.288
he's gotta be willing to get clean,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.540
and right now, I'm just not seeing

14:33.623 --> 14:35.083

that he wants to do that.

in with Kate Lawson.

They're best friends.

14:47.804 --> 14:51.808
Henry is being evaluated in radiology,

Oh, my God.

when they're out? We just wanna see them.

Yes, of course. I'll let you know

15:07.616 --> 15:08.825
Did you schedule the transplant?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.286
Oh, Gary's donor has the flu.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.164
Her temp is 100.3.

will get better soon.

too, just in case.

breathing trouble at all?

16:28.613 --> 16:31.950

If that was our daughter,

her smoking history's
the first thing I'd be telling the doctor.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.692
I'm sure they're just embarrassed.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.736
I mean, they probably
feel like they've got it under control.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.154
Yeah, I guess.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.244
We need to intubate.
Fifteen of etomidate, seventy of sux.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.455
Alice, sweetie,
I'm gonna have to sedate you

22:52.538 --> 22:54.332
so we can put a tube in
to help you breathe, okay?

22:54.415 --> 22:56.501
Wait, wait, wait, you mean
the machine is gonna breathe for her?

22:56.584 --> 22:58.377
She can't do it anymore on her own.
We don't have a choice.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.630
Meds are in.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.882
-There you go.
-Alice?

23:05.968 --> 23:07.220
I'm in.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.474
Sats up to 83.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.268
Why is this happening?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.229
I don't know.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.108
Order a new round of tests.
We're gonna figure this out.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.276
I need to get some air.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.117
How'd she do?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.369
The surgery went well, but then again,
eight units of blood,

23:31.452 --> 23:34.705
so she may end up with deficits,
or not even wake up at all.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.582
Just gotta wait and see.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.755
NATALIE: I assure you,
as soon as we know any answers,

23:42.839 --> 23:44.507
-I will let you know.
-Is that Dr. Marcel?

23:45.883 --> 23:46.926
Uh...

23:48.136 --> 23:49.887
Why didn't you separate Henry and Kate
before bringing them in?

23:49.971 --> 23:50.972
My brother's a doctor.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.640
He says you never move
people together like that.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.059
Kate was in bad shape.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.477
We didn't have a choice.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.229
What do you mean?

23:58.312 --> 24:00.773
Well, keeping them together
was the only way to save her.

24:00.857 --> 24:01.899
She was gonna die.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.985
Wait, so you endangered our son?

24:04.068 --> 24:05.111
How could you?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.071
I didn't have a choice.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.073
Not if they both could have
a chance to live.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.826
No, you did have a choice.
And you have no right to make it.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.203
I understand. I do.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.081
And I'll speak with you
after your son's surgery.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.667
Okay?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.211
If you'll excuse me.

24:27.425 --> 24:28.968
-I tried to keep them calm.
-Yeah.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.636
No, they're right.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.347
I'll come back to answer their question
as soon as Henry's carotid is tied off.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.433
What? You're gonna tie it off?

24:35.516 --> 24:38.019
But he wouldn't have normal blood flow
to his brain for the rest of his life.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.103
Why not reconstruct?

24:39.187 --> 24:42.607
Reconstruction is long and risky.
He's already lost a lot of blood.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.275
So?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.652
So, it makes him a poor candidate
for prolonged anesthesia.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.238
Well, I know what it means.
I just don't understand

24:49.322 --> 24:50.907
why you're suddenly
trying to play it safe.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.826
Because I've already done
enough damage today.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.328
I'm not gonna do any more.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.082
Crockett. Hey.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.335
That boy deserves

25:02.418 --> 25:04.629
to come out of this
with the best outcome possible.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.423
So you need to go in there
and do everything that you can

25:07.506 --> 25:08.758
to make sure that happens.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.178
Okay?

25:27.235 --> 25:28.945
What's going on here?

25:30.238 --> 25:32.573
I'm checking the staff to see

25:33.908 --> 25:35.117
if there's a donor for Gary.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.329
Maggie, we've got an ED
full of injured children.

25:38.412 --> 25:41.082
-Our staff is needed in there.
-I know.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.792
And that's why I'm going as fast as I can.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.210
Maggie, we can't have this.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.462
But if we...

25:46.545 --> 25:50.049
If we don't find a donor
for him today, he's gonna die.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.011
After battling cancer
for a year, every day,

25:54.095 --> 25:56.639
and then to have a cure right there,
right in his hands,

25:56.722 --> 25:58.057
and then to have it taken away?

25:58.140 --> 26:01.352
I've got a hospital full of patients
who need care.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.231
Everybody. Back to work.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.245
Excuse me.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.164
My little boy's in there.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.624
He was on the school bus.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.334
And I hope someone would do this for him.

26:27.378 --> 26:28.671
Where do you want me?

26:32.383 --> 26:33.551
Right here.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.820
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did you do?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.032
Dr. Charles, I already lost an addict

26:56.115 --> 26:58.409
that I helped get hooked on opioids.
I'm not about to lose another.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.828
You let this get way too personal, Will.
Never a good idea.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.913
For God's sakes, isn't it personal?

27:02.997 --> 27:04.665
You lost a brother to drugs.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.292
What's that got to do with anything?

27:06.375 --> 27:08.002
You've been there.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.545
Okay, you should know

27:09.628 --> 27:11.630
that we can't endlessly deliberate
over every patient.

27:11.714 --> 27:12.757
Enough!

27:14.342 --> 27:16.344
You have a lot of nerve
bringing up my little brother.

27:16.427 --> 27:19.805
But since you have, not a day goes by
when I don't miss him

27:19.889 --> 27:21.140
or wonder what I could
have done differently,

27:21.223 --> 27:23.642
but what I never do is bring that to work

27:23.726 --> 27:25.936
and let it affect
my professional judgment.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.821
-MARCEL: Okay, how we doing?
-Carotid's mobilized. Ready to tie.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.490
MARCEL: Okay, silk tie on a pass.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.130
Dr. Marcel.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.845
Open a patch.
We're switching to reconstruction.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.684
You sure?
He's pretty coagulopathic.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.228
I'm sure.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.193
MARCEL: Adjusting the upper clamp.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.240
(MONITOR BEEPS LOUDLY)

28:19.323 --> 28:22.034

Crockett.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.285
Give me a three-inch shunt.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.954
Dr. Marcel, if we just
tie the carotid off...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.622
-Give me the shunt.
-(SIGHS)

28:27.206 --> 28:29.041
Come on, come on. Shunt.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.626

29:02.616 --> 29:05.077
Let's get started on this patch.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.671
Mr. Walker, there's no vaping
allowed in the hospital.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.049
Oh, sorry. I didn't know.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.385
Let me ask you something.
Does your daughter vape?

29:21.469 --> 29:22.553
What? No.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.182
Well, I mean, she did,
but just to get her off the cigarettes.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.226
You know.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.229
Doctor?

29:36.150 --> 29:37.526
-APRIL: What's going on?
-She's been vaping.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.322
-Mind if I look at this?
-Sure?

29:42.031 --> 29:44.450
I don't think you're gonna find anything.
She stopped vaping six months ago.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.660
She's 12 years old. Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

29:46.744 --> 29:48.245
It's better than smoking.
That causes cancer.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.414
She only did it for three weeks.
She did it long enough to quit.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.749
MR. WALKER: I mean, it's totally safe.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.667
Vaping's not addictive
like cigarettes are.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.922
Oh, my God.
Are these yours?

29:58.756 --> 29:59.757
No.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.677
She must've gotten them from school
or from her friends.

30:03.761 --> 30:04.929
We had no idea.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.724
Oh, my God.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.064
Let's wait and see
what the last few tests show.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.733
We'll be back in a little bit.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.786
Ronnie? Any luck?

30:28.869 --> 30:30.120
No.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.750
You do realize you found
almost 40 potential donors?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.461
We usually don't get that many in a month.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.881

30:42.383 --> 30:43.467

30:44.051 --> 30:46.387

30:46.470 --> 30:48.681

-Maggie...

32:14.600 --> 32:17.603
Dr. Marcel, I'm sorry about before.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.106
Thanks for saving our son.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.650
Yeah, of course.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.903
How's Kate?

32:27.613 --> 32:28.739
We don't know yet.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.533
Crockett. Kate's waking up.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.415
Kate, sweetie, do you remember
where you first saw me?

32:39.541 --> 32:41.543

32:42.127 --> 32:44.421
Yeah, good. Really good.

for me, sweetheart?

32:52.346 --> 32:54.640

33:04.108 --> 33:06.568
Yeah, just like that.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.213
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

33:27.297 --> 33:28.298
Hi.

33:28.382 --> 33:29.675
Did you get the other tests back?

33:30.801 --> 33:32.219
I'm afraid they were all negative.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.722
So, it was the vaping.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.141
We call it EVALI.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.811
E-cigarette or vaping-associated
lung injury.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.813
She must've already had it,

33:42.896 --> 33:44.773
but the bus accident
pushed her over the edge.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.777
So how long till she gets better?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.322
I wish I could tell you,

33:53.699 --> 33:54.950
but we don't know if she will.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.035
What do you mean?

33:57.119 --> 33:59.955
This condition is so new,

34:00.038 --> 34:01.248
we're still figuring it out.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.501
Your daughter may begin
to breathe again on her own,

34:04.585 --> 34:06.086
but she may not.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.172
Never?

34:08.964 --> 34:10.174
It's possible.

34:12.009 --> 34:15.804

I wasn't being told the truth.

I've never seen you like that before.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.144
What was going on?

36:28.645 --> 36:30.689
Nothing. It was a choice.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.150
A choice no one else would've made.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.029
Why did you?

36:43.285 --> 36:45.704
Because no one should have
to lose a child.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.790
No, of course not, but it was still...

I've got something I want to show you.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.154
Come with me.

37:29.665 --> 37:30.666
What's this?

37:33.627 --> 37:36.546
We were able to match some
of the donors you found

37:36.630 --> 37:39.841
with other patients waiting
on the transplant list.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.303
All these people?

37:44.721 --> 37:48.266
Yeah. And there are more on the way.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.937
You saved a lot of lives today, Maggie.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.455
Hey. Ready to do it again?

38:11.957 --> 38:16.461
Listen, Sean, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can do this anymore.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.130
Whoa... What's going on?

38:19.339 --> 38:20.966
Just not cut out for it.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.387
Will, we have all had these moments.

38:26.013 --> 38:29.016
Doctor, there's someone here to see you.

38:35.022 --> 38:36.023
Hey.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.985
-Hi.
-I met you this morning.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.949
When I was foaming on the ground.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

38:47.034 --> 38:48.201
Yeah, I remember.

38:49.828 --> 38:50.912
Um...

38:51.580 --> 38:54.499
I'm new here, and...

38:56.960 --> 38:58.545
This place is a godsend.

38:59.796 --> 39:03.300
Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks

39:04.551 --> 39:06.428
for saving my life.

39:10.724 --> 39:12.517
I'm gonna try to turn things around.

39:16.438 --> 39:17.439
Good.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.234
I'm glad to hear that.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.028
Yeah.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.489
Okay.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.710
Ooh...

39:40.962 --> 39:42.214
Hey, Uncle Dan.

39:43.090 --> 39:46.259
Practice always end this late?
When do you do your homework, man?

39:46.343 --> 39:47.928
(LAUGHS) I'm a psych major.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.597
You can basically make it
all up as you go.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.307
(CHUCKLES) That's funny.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.143
You, uh... You hungry?

39:55.727 --> 39:57.229
Is that a question?

39:58.188 --> 40:00.273
-Come with me.
-All right.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.777
So, you checking up on me?

40:04.444 --> 40:05.529
Eh...

40:05.612 --> 40:07.656
No. Not really.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.867
Maybe. Sort of. I don't know.

40:10.951 --> 40:13.662
All right, don't worry.
I'm still clean.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.789
The team checks my pee every month.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.837
I loved my dad, but I'm not gonna
end up like him.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.844
You know how proud I am of you, right?

40:28.927 --> 40:30.762
-Yeah.
-Do you?

40:30.846 --> 40:33.306
-Yeah.
-Good.
