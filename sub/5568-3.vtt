to meet him,

19:17.190 --> 19:18.289

to clean up

19:18.291 --> 19:19.957
a big mess at Shaq motors
Nashville.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.826
Some raccoons
got into the corollas.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.028
That makes sense.
Shaq is great with animals.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.297
At least
i still got this tank!

19:26.299 --> 19:28.166
I can't wait
to show Emery and Evan!

19:28.168 --> 19:29.433
You know,
a few years from now,

19:29.435 --> 19:31.335
you can sell that thing
for a lot of money.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.837
It's not about the money.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.105
I'd never sell this shoe.

19:34.107 --> 19:38.009
It means way too much...

19:38.011 --> 19:39.443
To me.

Oinker! Tina!

19:51.057 --> 19:53.724
I know it was hard
selling that shoe,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.660
but you did
the right thing.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.395
You're a good brother.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.697
I had it in my hand.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.567
I fit my entire face
inside of it.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.902
It smelled like pizza.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.838
I love this car.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.640
And no one made
any money off of it.

[ Chuckles ] So, I'll take
the grease to the dump

20:12.745 --> 20:14.178
and then drop Eddie off
at practice.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.913
And I'll take Evan and Emery
to the store,

20:15.915 --> 20:19.217
then we'll pick up grandma
from the hand surgeon.

This car is
too nice to drive.

20:21.154 --> 20:22.486
Let's just all just jam
in the Van.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.392
All right, everyone.
Take a knee.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.762
We took a loss today,
and there's no way around it.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.166
Today, they were
better than us.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.867
But you know what?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.603
That's only one car.

20:38.605 --> 20:42.506
Out there, there are
387 more new and pre-owned cars,

20:42.508 --> 20:45.776
each one of them looking
for a warm garage to call home.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.745
Who's gonna get them home?

Is it you, Barbara?

As a matter of fact, Freddie,
you're fired. Get out.

Get out, Freddie!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.287
Okay.

I'm just playing, Freddie.
Sit down.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.058
Sit down.
I'm just playing.
Okay.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.861
But seriously, you've got to
get your ass together.
