WEBVTT

00:35.035 --> 00:37.245
It's important to me
to make everyone look good,

00:37.328 --> 00:39.998
but I never forget that my main job

00:40.081 --> 00:42.417
is to make everyone's head
fit in a helmet.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.961
Hey, Norman. What you got there?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.921
Notice for our Army physical examinations.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.506
Barbers are up in six weeks.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.216
I have to get another physical?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.843
But didn't I just get one?

00:51.968 --> 00:54.512
Uh, four years ago.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.972
You counting on another miracle?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.563
This, this thing...

01:06.399 --> 01:07.650
Making me run.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.824
Hmm. Well, soldier, looks like you...

01:14.908 --> 01:15.909
Passed?

01:15.992 --> 01:17.285
Oh, this isn't right.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.537
Frank, you bonehead, you forgot to reset.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.790
Well, what do we do?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.335
Congratulations, soldier!

01:25.418 --> 01:26.336
You passed!

01:29.964 --> 01:32.842
I got lucky once,
maybe it'll happen again.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.052
You really need luck?

01:34.135 --> 01:36.721
Okay, you can rub my head.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.599
Bill, you've got six weeks
to pass that physical.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.518
That's plenty of time to get into shape.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.519
Really?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.687
Yeah, man, but you talk,
talkin' 'bout ol' physician

01:44.771 --> 01:46.940
before starting a dang
ol' exercise program, man.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.859
Talkin' 'bout dang ol' tick,
tick, tick, boom, man.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.072
Yes,
you need to start eating right.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.199
But what you really need is exercise.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.325
Hm?

01:57.408 --> 02:00.203
Have you considered joining a gym?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.121
A gym?

02:01.204 --> 02:04.874
But I can't work out in public,
in front of all those healthy people.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.126
I'm too fat.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.503
You're too fat to go to a gym?

02:08.586 --> 02:09.921
Poor Bill.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.216
Too fat to work out,
not fat enough to live in bed.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.176
Well, you can always work out at home.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.220
A ton of people have tried
that and are now selling

02:17.303 --> 02:19.305
their equipment on
our community bulletin board.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.188
Hey, that's Principal Moss's address.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.151
This is some nice equipment, Carl.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.362
Wait. "Property of Tom
Landry Middle School"?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.198
Football team got all new equipment.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.410
I thought, as principal,
it was my duty to sell it.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.828
For the children.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.496
So, Bill, what do you think?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.499
I don't know. I mean,
I don't wanna lose my job...

02:46.583 --> 02:50.044
that's where I go every day,
but this is all so pricey.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.504
The children will take less.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.923
Well, how about we all
go in on it together?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.550
Then everyone can use it.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.053
We'll set it up in your garage,
it'll be like our own neighborhood gym.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
So you guys will get me in shape?

03:01.806 --> 03:04.017
No, Bill. We'll be there
to help you get started,

03:04.100 --> 03:07.645
but the simple fact is,
only you can get you into shape.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.063
Yeah, while I'm at it,

03:09.147 --> 03:11.816
why don't I fly to the moon
and marry a mermaid?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
You can do this, Bill.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.528
You used to be a high school athlete.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.574
All you need is focus, a little
hard work and self-discipline.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.412
I can throw in an overhead projector.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
This is the perfect place for a gym.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.799
It's close, it's quiet,
and it already smelled.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.260
Yeah, it's so much better than my gym.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.138
Do you know how many skeevie
old men's cell phone cameras

03:42.222 --> 03:44.515
go off when I get on
that inner thigh machine?

03:44.599 --> 03:46.059
I'm kind of tired of my gym.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.938
The machines are great,
but it's nothing but gay sex all the time.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.441
This should come with a cape!

04:04.327 --> 04:05.828
Come on, Bill, you're up.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.958
Maybe I could lift weights later.
When everyone is gone.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.002
This is not the place for you
to finally start feeling embarrassed.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.129
Yeah, it's a safe environment, shug.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.424
Peggy tooted on the hack squat machine,
and nobody said a word.

04:32.981 --> 04:33.898
I did it!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.441
Yay!

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
I know you can do, man.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.279
I can get in shape!

04:39.362 --> 04:40.905
I can pass my physical.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.992
I can fly to the moon and marry a mermaid!

04:44.075 --> 04:45.952
To the moon!

05:04.679 --> 05:05.847
"Pec Nectar.

05:05.930 --> 05:10.101
Insane fuel for hard-core mass
and road map vascularity."

05:10.184 --> 05:11.352
Hmm.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.521
Oh! Sorry.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.981
I thought you were a bear.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.607
You lookin' to get jacked, brother?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.443
I, I'm here to get some vitamins.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.694
Vitamins?

05:19.777 --> 05:22.488
You lookin' to fight
the sniffles or max your pump?

05:22.572 --> 05:24.490
I don't know, I just wanna get healthy.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.658
Right on, bro.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.994
Have you ever seen anything
more healthy than this?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.204
I can't be that healthy.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.707
You can't-ed your way
into that body, hombre.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.043
Lucky for you, I can help.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.547
Well, I would definitely love the help,
but Hank says I have to do this myself.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.506
Hank?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.801
I hate to see a guy like you,
with real desire,

05:43.885 --> 05:47.805
being led astray by a workout zero
like this chump Hank!

05:47.889 --> 05:49.515
Can your Hank do this?

05:51.851 --> 05:54.604
Wow, Hank doesn't even have those.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.689
Exactly. You know how I got 'em?

05:56.814 --> 05:57.857
Spinach?

05:57.940 --> 06:00.526
From a well-crafted total fitness regimen.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.695
Tell me, brother, where do you work out?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.447
I just have a little gym at home.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.034
Friend, this is your lucky day.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.161
The Dirkster is taking over your training.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.121
No, but I could never afford you.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.623
I mean, you're huge.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.540
I am.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.876
That's why the local gyms
won't let me train.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.836
They're jealous of my pump.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.755
So this is what we're gonna do.

06:20.838 --> 06:24.675
I'll train you for free,
and you let me use your home gym.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.719
So it's not all up to me?

06:26.803 --> 06:27.929
Well, that sounds great!

06:28.054 --> 06:29.931
It's beyond great. I can get you stacked,

06:30.014 --> 06:32.141
jacked and juiced,
but I need 100% commitment!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.227
I need you to pledge allegiance
to the nation of pump!

06:34.310 --> 06:37.730
I need you to vow to get
in the best shape of your life!

06:37.814 --> 06:38.689
You in, brother?

06:40.024 --> 06:41.359
I'm in!

06:43.361 --> 06:44.362
Brother!

06:48.282 --> 06:49.575
Yep.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.868
Yup.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.953
Mm-hmm.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.374
Dirk says this rapid-release
protein supplement

06:56.457 --> 06:58.000
will really max my pump.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
Question, who is Dirk,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.171
what is a rapid-release
protein supplement,

07:02.255 --> 07:05.550
where is your pump,
and why does Dirk want to max it?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.427
Well, Dirk is a personal trainer.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.512
He's gonna create a workout system for me

07:09.595 --> 07:11.556
-to ensure total fitness.
-What?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.975
Well, that's what
professional personal trainers do.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.853
They don't just send you out on
your own and hope for the best.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.147
You know, like you did, Hank.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.148
Damn it, Hank,

07:20.231 --> 07:23.776
sooner or later, your sunny optimism
is going to get us all killed.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.616
Ah, so nice.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.452
Who thought Bill's house could function as

07:32.535 --> 07:34.787
something other than a shrine
to crushing misery?

07:35.788 --> 07:38.082
Ooh! My trainer's here!

07:44.380 --> 07:46.674
Hey, Bill, this is Gorilla and Coach.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.217
Let's blast some delts!

07:50.094 --> 07:53.306
Gorilla in the house!

07:55.057 --> 07:59.353
All right, tea party's over!

08:00.855 --> 08:03.232
Excuse me, what are you doing?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.443
Don't worry, just adding
a little resistance

08:05.526 --> 08:07.361
to shred your bis.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.618
Hey there, sweets, let me help you.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.453
See, your elbows aren't tight,

08:15.536 --> 08:18.080
so you're missing out on a sick rip!

08:22.251 --> 08:24.712
His arm's having a heart attack!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.925
I'll tell you why I don't lift weights.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.595
'Cause every time I start to lift, I wait.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.851
Quiet down, Bobby.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.271
Sorry, Dirk. You were
talking about my delts.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.736
Big up, Gorilla!

08:48.819 --> 08:50.196
Represent!

08:52.281 --> 08:54.283
Hey, Hank!

08:55.326 --> 08:58.120
Bill, these are your trainers?
They're huge!

08:58.204 --> 09:01.874
I know! You can tell them that
if you want to. It's not rude.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.292
Uh, that's okay.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.547
Uh, so, those pants sure are, uh, tiny.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.174
You wanna put on some, uh... more pants

09:10.299 --> 09:12.802
and come on out for some light cardio?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.136
Cardio!

09:15.888 --> 09:17.598
Sorry, Hank, no time.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.267
I'm moving on to biceps.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.727
Yeah! Time to feed the pythons!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.897
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.567
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.568
Oh, yeah.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.945
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.120
Hmm. I don't like being around
those scary weight-lifter guys.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.830
They talk in yelling.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.041
Yeah, and they look like
they're filled with bowling balls.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.334
They are freaks, Hank.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.588
I swear I saw
a live chicken go in that gym

09:48.671 --> 09:50.089
that did not come out.

09:50.214 --> 09:53.050
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
I enjoyed what I saw,

09:53.134 --> 09:55.511
but the truth is,
they've got Bill working out,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.887
and that's what's important.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.764
We'll just have to work around them.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.030
Uh... no, sir!

11:01.285 --> 11:04.622
You know the military physical
is mostly running on a treadmill, right?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.706
Run?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.917
These guns run from nothing.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.213
Ew!

11:16.092 --> 11:18.135
Your bulk is so fierce.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.389
Almost as swole as mine.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.892
Damn, it's too bad
nobody else is here to see this sweet rip.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.812
Dude, I'm right here,
and I think you're lookin' yolked.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.107
I know, but I'm talking
about small people.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.121
Huh.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.956
We need to make some rules.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.920
Hey, Bill, uh, you got a second?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.010
Uh, Bill?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.097
What's on your mind?

12:03.180 --> 12:06.892
Uh, the thing is,
the atmosphere has changed around here,

12:06.976 --> 12:10.271
and people aren't really comfortable
using the gym anymore.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.940
There's nothing comfortable
about getting shredded, Hank.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.736
What you're not
comfortable with is hard work and pain.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.446
That's 'cause all you people are lazy.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.613
Now, hold on.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.365
Prove me wrong, Little Man.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.700
Why don't you hit the bench?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.786
I'm not getting on
the got-dang bench, Bill.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.204
Quit being a jackass.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.956
I'll tell you what.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.585
Why don't you smurfs start
your own gym across the way?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.212
These look about your size.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.592
You're a jerk, Bill.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.594
Just forget it. You can keep your weights.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.804
Don't take it personal.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.806
He's just jealous of your juicy rip.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.619
They're just weak.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.205
They want this body!

13:09.288 --> 13:10.873
Want this power!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.875
Want this pump!

13:13.626 --> 13:15.127
I'll show 'em who's a jerk!

13:23.844 --> 13:26.388
Ow!

13:31.769 --> 13:33.813
Ugh! Oh!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.731
All right, Diesel!

13:35.815 --> 13:36.732
You need a spot?

13:36.816 --> 13:40.110
I, I need a... a doctor.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.113
I pushed it... too hard.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.574
This is great.
You've reached the threshold!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.410
It's the moment when your entire body
is screaming at you to stop,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.580
and you think
there's a realistic chance you might die.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.165
I know it's a good workout

13:53.249 --> 13:56.335
when blood vessels
in the back of my eyeballs pop!

13:56.836 --> 13:59.755
No agony, no braggony.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.006
Am I right?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.758
Uh-uh.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.134
Diesel's lost focus.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.887
Guys, we're gonna have to
move in here and keep him true.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.810
No more. No more!

14:12.935 --> 14:16.146
You're gonna want to sleep,
but don't worry.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.232
I won't let that happen.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.150
Yeah, but, but I...

14:27.324 --> 14:30.244
Push! Push! Push!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.501
You look like you need a protein fix.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.670
No.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.757
"Look at me eating eggs."

14:43.841 --> 14:44.884
Show-off.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.977
All right! Good stack and rack, guys!

14:55.394 --> 14:56.896
Wait, please.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.647
Can I get a hand?

14:58.731 --> 15:02.443
Nope, but if you can get up by yourself,
you can sleep in your own bed

15:02.526 --> 15:04.653
and use your own toilet.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.739
We'll leave the thrash metal on
for motivation.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.743
Help!

15:10.826 --> 15:12.411
Help!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.915
Help!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.467
George Washington, no mass.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.802
Thomas Jefferson, no mass.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.472
Freakin' Ben Franklin, no mass.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.682
That's why they won't
let Arnold be president.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.850
They're jealous!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.185
It ain't right!

15:37.019 --> 15:38.604
War!

15:39.229 --> 15:40.314
Yeah!

15:40.397 --> 15:42.775
Three! Yeah, yeah!

15:42.858 --> 15:44.818
Here comes Jack!

15:44.902 --> 15:46.403
Yeah!

15:55.371 --> 15:56.372
Uh, hello?

15:56.455 --> 15:57.957
<i>Hank! Hank!</i>

15:58.082 --> 16:01.126
Ugh! It's 3:00 in the morning. Bill?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.462
<i>It's me! It's me Bill!</i>

16:03.545 --> 16:06.548
Ugh! Did you call just to let me know
you're working out?

16:06.632 --> 16:07.841
Well, okay, I get it!

16:07.925 --> 16:08.801
<i>No!</i>

16:15.391 --> 16:17.518
How much longer till bedtime?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.603
14 minutes.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.771
Righteous.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.381
All right, Diesel, working the abs!

16:47.464 --> 16:49.049
But today's a pec day.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.307
Hank, today is Bill's Army physical,

16:57.391 --> 17:00.102
Bobby, it's chicken and dumplings
for school lunch,

17:00.185 --> 17:02.021
and I have a pap smear.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.023
I hate chicken and dumplings.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.607
I'll trade you, Mom.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.861
Dang it. I bet Bill forgot
his physical was today.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.487
You gonna remind him, Dad?

17:10.571 --> 17:11.655
No, I'm not, Bobby.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.283
Mr. Dauterive is no longer a friend,

17:14.366 --> 17:16.827
he's just a pumped up, annoying neighbor.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.955
I'm a little grossed out by him, too, Dad,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.374
but he was human once.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.211
Well, I guess I should remind him.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.173
If he loses his job,
he'll have to sell his weights,

17:29.256 --> 17:33.218
and then he'll come over here
and crush our appliances for exercise.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.054
Can't do it.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.557
Damn it, Diesel, we haven't gotten
a good rep out of you in two days!

17:38.640 --> 17:41.101
We were soft on him. We let him down.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.815
Oh, God.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.693
Bill, did you forget
you have your physical today?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.862
Bill hasn't passed our physical yet.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.114
And that's the only one
that matters, right, Diesel?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.368
-Right on!
-Yeah, you heard him!

17:58.452 --> 17:59.536
Are you okay, Bill?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.206
Sure he's okay. He's in the zone!

18:08.545 --> 18:10.214
So I tell Minh,

18:10.297 --> 18:13.133
I trade this six-pack for this six-pack.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.387
She threw me out.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.806
Guys.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.890
And Kahn.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.058
Hello.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.726
I'm worried about Bill.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.852
You should be.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.395
You probably fall somewhere between

18:25.479 --> 18:28.273
a drumstick and a ham sandwich
to him these days.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.902
He's hurt bad, and I think
those meatheads are holding him captive.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.615
I know, Boomhauer,
but what I just saw was a glimpse of,

18:36.698 --> 18:37.908
well, Bill.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.078
I mean, the real Bill,
with all his fear and anguish

18:41.161 --> 18:43.914
and self-loathing, and he looked hurt.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.125
We need to get him to a doctor.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.835
Push! Push! Push!

18:47.918 --> 18:48.919
Rock and roll!

18:56.426 --> 18:59.263
Uh, hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.516
Uh, here's the thing,
we all admire your pump

19:02.599 --> 19:03.517
so much,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.062
we want you to help
swell our thick and such.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.732
Right on, brothers.
I knew you'd come around.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.109
Let's work on those traps.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.779
Actually, uh, maybe he should
help with my traps.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.406
His are way bigger than yours.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.032
-It's true.
-Yeah, man, tell you what, man.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.118
Coach? Please.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.369
His traps are like speed bumps.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.122
I've got a bus parked
on either side of my neck.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.999
Speed bumps?

19:30.752 --> 19:31.837
Check it.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.008
Actually, this one have
best physique of all you guys.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.385
Whoa, yeah!

19:38.468 --> 19:39.386
Dig it!

19:49.188 --> 19:52.107
We're gonna get you out of here, Bill.
Okay, let's lift him up.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.781
Man, dang ol', maybe we do need to lift

19:59.865 --> 20:02.701
some got dang ol' weights,
man, pump our thick, man.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.917
So what's the situation, Doctor?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.168
Is he gonna be okay?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
Well, it's incredible.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.715
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.427
What are we looking at here?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.763
I don't quite know how to put this.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.390
I mean, we don't even have a term for it,

20:25.474 --> 20:27.768
but your rectum ruptured,

20:27.851 --> 20:30.646
and, well, your internal systems

20:30.729 --> 20:33.774
became... external.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.193
Oh, my God.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.153
I know, it's amazing!

20:38.237 --> 20:40.030
The pain must have been unbearable!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.241
Oh, sorry.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.538
I can't work out for six months.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.083
My muscles will be gone by then.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.918
Well, you looked better without them.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.421
And, hey, at least your physical
was postponed until you recover.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.756
Yeah.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.174
Well, look at it this way.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.718
You've got a new goal,
dropping that extra weight.

21:01.843 --> 21:05.138
Let's start with a really
killer walk to the mailbox.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.685
How's that? You feel the burn?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.729
-No.
-Perfect.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.855
<i>No agony, no braggony!</i>
