knocked down walls
and filled in ponds.

were falling down anyway

we've got time for today.

14:17.694 --> 14:21.072
Your favourite station will be
back same time tomorrow.
Keep it Rob Roy.

14:21.155 --> 14:23.449
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

14:26.994 --> 14:28.454
(MUSIC STOPS PLAYING)

14:40.383 --> 14:42.135
How you doing? Lovely day.

14:42.218 --> 14:43.803
Yeah, wonderful.
What's in the bag?

14:43.886 --> 14:45.722
What bag? This bag?

14:46.347 --> 14:48.141
Mushrooms.

14:48.224 --> 14:49.475
Bit early in the season,
isn't it?

14:50.435 --> 14:51.936
They're imported.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.730
I just picked them up
from the airport.

14:53.813 --> 14:56.315
(SIGHING) Tony Parker,
Scottish Radio Board.

14:56.399 --> 14:58.568
That's a relief. I thought
you were the Terminator!

14:58.651 --> 15:00.153
I am.

15:00.236 --> 15:01.320
Open the bag, please.

15:02.405 --> 15:04.365
Er, I don't think so.

15:04.449 --> 15:08.286
Oi, I'm asking you
to open the bag!

15:08.369 --> 15:09.954
And you can ask,

15:10.038 --> 15:11.581
but you can't make me,
can you?

15:13.708 --> 15:15.626
Well, enjoy your walk.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.879
You could probably pick up
some good radio stations
with all that gear.

15:19.839 --> 15:21.049
See ya.

15:26.679 --> 15:28.431
No wellies?

15:28.514 --> 15:29.682
I left them in Edinburgh.

15:31.559 --> 15:32.685
I don't know
why you're bothering.

15:33.519 --> 15:35.688
My granny hated slugs.

15:35.772 --> 15:37.565
Frogs used to keep them
under control,

15:37.648 --> 15:39.734
till Reavey filled in
the pond.

15:39.817 --> 15:41.694
Yeah, I've spoken
to Mr Reavey.

15:41.778 --> 15:43.237
Did you ask him
about my cattle?

15:43.321 --> 15:44.822
Cattle? What cattle?

15:44.906 --> 15:47.200
Twelve head of Highland cattle
that belonged to my gran.

15:47.283 --> 15:48.951
-Where are they?
-Hold on.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.205
-Is it true you asked Reavey
to look after this land?
-No.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.793
Well, yeah, look after it,
not ravage it.

15:56.876 --> 15:58.711
I didn't know
that he was gonna
drench it in pesticide

15:58.795 --> 16:00.088
and cut down my gran's wood.

16:00.171 --> 16:01.631
It's not your gran's wood.

16:01.714 --> 16:03.049
It belongs to the estate.

16:03.132 --> 16:04.550
Have you told him that?

16:04.634 --> 16:06.010
Look, if he carries on
like this,

16:06.094 --> 16:07.679
there'll be nothing
left of my granny's farm.

16:09.013 --> 16:11.182
So much for
the laird's promise.

16:11.265 --> 16:13.059
If I lease this place to you,

16:14.477 --> 16:16.396
what will you do,
farm it yourself?

16:16.479 --> 16:17.522
I have a job.

16:18.648 --> 16:21.150
Fine.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.736
I'll get a manager
and I'll come up
at the weekends.

16:23.820 --> 16:25.196
Farming's hard work.

16:25.279 --> 16:27.365
It's not a hobby
for nice girls from Edinburgh.

16:27.448 --> 16:30.660
Look, I am more
of a Highlander than
you'll ever be, Mr Bowman.

16:30.743 --> 16:32.829
Then you should have
come up here better prepared,
shouldn't you?

16:37.834 --> 16:40.294
I'll give you a month
to find suitable tenants.

16:40.378 --> 16:42.755
After that,
if Reavey wants the lease,
he can have it.

16:46.634 --> 16:48.302
Here, you missed one.

17:04.402 --> 17:07.655
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
I had to sort out some...

17:07.739 --> 17:09.781
Oh, anyway,
the loch blessing...

17:09.866 --> 17:11.659
It's all right,
we haven't been
here that long.

17:13.202 --> 17:15.121
Oh, I should change.

17:15.204 --> 17:16.748
Oh, no, I can't keep you
waiting any longer.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.992
May the open heart
be filled with...

17:54.077 --> 17:55.285
No.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.871
Uh, may the open hand
be filled...

18:00.749 --> 18:02.126
I'm sorry,
it's gone right
out of my head.

18:04.212 --> 18:05.630
No. Uh, no,
you're all right, um...

18:05.712 --> 18:07.465
(CLEARING THROAT)

18:07.548 --> 18:09.841
May the open hand
be filled the fullest,

18:09.926 --> 18:12.136
may this spring
bring forth new life.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.560
Have I missed something?

18:19.644 --> 18:20.895
Don't you drink from the cup?

18:22.605 --> 18:23.648
You're joking?

18:28.778 --> 18:30.363
Mmm, I'm getting blackberries.

18:30.446 --> 18:31.447
(ALL SNORTING)

18:37.995 --> 18:39.330
-Are we done?
-Yep.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.002
Paul, don't disappear.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.464
Is that it?

18:48.548 --> 18:49.841
Does the water not part
or anything?

18:58.516 --> 19:00.560
You want me to organise
a stakeout?

19:00.643 --> 19:03.604
Someone's been stealing
my orchids.

19:03.688 --> 19:05.148
I just need Golly
for a few days.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.941
-No, Golly's gonna be busy.
-Well, Duncan then.

19:07.025 --> 19:10.570
Look, Molly, I'm sorry,
I can't spare anyone
to baby-sit a plant.

19:10.653 --> 19:13.364
Very well, I'll deal
with these vandals myself.

19:18.536 --> 19:22.790
If we cut a main ditch here,
we can drain off
about 60 acres.

19:22.874 --> 19:24.751
-All potential pasture.
-Right.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.587
Sorry, but why do I need
to know this?

19:27.670 --> 19:30.923
Because I want you
to take charge of the project.

19:31.007 --> 19:33.051
I've been thinking
about redeployment.

19:33.134 --> 19:35.595
Jess to look after
the game and wildlife,

19:35.678 --> 19:37.680
you to take charge
of land improvement.

19:39.515 --> 19:41.601
I mean, I'm talking about
the whole estate.

19:41.684 --> 19:43.936
That's years of work.

19:44.020 --> 19:47.231
Uh, yeah, I know,
but that's just it.

19:47.315 --> 19:49.776
Uh, I'm really flattered,
Paul, but...

19:49.859 --> 19:52.945
It's just...
I might not be around.

19:54.530 --> 19:55.531
How do you mean?

20:16.469 --> 20:18.096
(LAUGHING) Molly?

20:18.763 --> 20:20.598
Oh, blast it!

20:20.682 --> 20:22.141
You weren't supposed
to see me.

20:22.225 --> 20:24.018
Have you been
at the plant food
or something?

20:24.102 --> 20:25.728
Camouflage, silly.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.773
Hector taught me
the rudiments.

20:28.856 --> 20:31.025
Mmm, love the eye shadow.

20:31.109 --> 20:33.736
Obviously not well enough,
otherwise you wouldn't
have noticed me.

20:33.820 --> 20:35.822
I think the roses
were a mistake.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.490
I can't use wild flowers.

20:37.573 --> 20:39.534
That's the whole point.

20:39.617 --> 20:41.452
Someone's been digging up
our orchids.

20:55.508 --> 20:58.720
Good news, I got us a client.

20:58.803 --> 21:01.931
-Guy called Jenkins
over in Cairn Lochan.
-Okay.

21:03.725 --> 21:05.601
PAUL: It's not even that far.
Just over the hill.

21:05.685 --> 21:09.480
-Unfortunate turn of phrase.
-Oh, come on, Golly.

21:09.564 --> 21:10.690
We're not putting
you out to pasture,

21:10.773 --> 21:11.983
we're putting you out to stud.

21:13.026 --> 21:14.736
We're making the most
of our assets.

21:14.819 --> 21:16.863
There's more to being a laird
than asset management.

21:20.450 --> 21:21.993
PAUL: Is this about
the loch blessing?

21:23.953 --> 21:26.456
Look, I know
I garbled it, but...

21:26.539 --> 21:29.542
It's just a ritual.
It doesn't matter
that much, does it?

21:29.625 --> 21:31.461
Well, if it doesn't
matter to you,
it doesn't matter, no.

21:35.048 --> 21:36.591
So you'll visit
this guy Jenkins, then?

21:38.343 --> 21:40.094
-I'll make sure he gets
his money's worth.
-Great.

21:43.890 --> 21:44.932
Thanks.

21:59.864 --> 22:00.907
Lex...

22:07.288 --> 22:08.664
Um...

22:10.083 --> 22:11.167
About New Zealand...

22:13.544 --> 22:14.921
I'd really love to come.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.590
(EXHALING) That's brilliant.

22:17.674 --> 22:19.133
I just need to ask Jess.

22:19.801 --> 22:20.927
Jess?

22:21.010 --> 22:22.136
Um...

22:23.638 --> 22:25.056
I'd want her to come with me.

22:26.307 --> 22:27.934
You see, well, the thing is,

22:30.311 --> 22:31.813
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.775
Duncan, I had no idea.

22:35.858 --> 22:38.069
No, neither did I,

22:38.152 --> 22:39.696
until now.

22:39.779 --> 22:41.280
That's amazing.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.075
I know!

22:44.158 --> 22:45.326
It is, isn't it?

22:45.410 --> 22:48.329
I mean, scary, but...

22:48.413 --> 22:50.665
-I really do.
-Don't tell me. You need
to tell her that.

22:50.748 --> 22:52.333
Yeah.

22:52.417 --> 22:56.254
-Oh, no, definitely.
-If you feel that way
about her

22:56.337 --> 22:58.172
and she feels the same way
about you, then

22:59.590 --> 23:00.591
don't wait.

23:01.342 --> 23:03.219
Seize the moment.

23:03.302 --> 23:04.929
Like you and Archie did,
you mean?

23:06.347 --> 23:07.348
Yeah.

23:08.433 --> 23:09.517
Like me and Archie did.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.312
You're right.

23:14.564 --> 23:15.898
I'm gonna do it!

23:19.944 --> 23:21.195
Thanks, Lex!

23:29.495 --> 23:33.124
None of my guests
have been able to catch
a damn thing for weeks.

23:34.834 --> 23:37.545
Nothing bigger
than sprats, anyway.

23:37.628 --> 23:39.339
Ah, the problem is,
Mr Jenkins,

23:39.422 --> 23:43.092
that your pond's
all fished out.

23:43.176 --> 23:45.928
It's not a pond, it's a loch.
What do you mean, fished out?

23:47.180 --> 23:50.099
Well, a pond
or a loch this size

23:50.183 --> 23:52.185
can't sustain you
and your guests
every week of the year.

23:52.268 --> 23:53.978
You have to let it recover.

23:54.062 --> 23:55.688
You have to think of the...

23:55.772 --> 23:56.898
Have to think
of the symbiosis.

23:58.232 --> 24:00.651
Symbiosis?
(SCOFFS)

24:00.735 --> 24:03.237
I thought you were a gillie,
not a Latin tutor.

24:05.698 --> 24:08.242
Ah, it's Greek, actually.

24:08.326 --> 24:10.828
Just show me
where the blasted fish
are hiding, will you?

24:13.831 --> 24:16.250
By the way,
since we are paying
for your services,

24:16.334 --> 24:18.419
would it be too much
to ask for you to look

24:19.837 --> 24:20.838
presentable?

24:24.092 --> 24:25.093
(EXHALING SHARPLY)

24:39.190 --> 24:42.276
-Your Lairdship.
-Uh, just Paul,
Sheriff Reavey.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.070
Call me Joe, please.

24:44.153 --> 24:48.199
Sheriff's just an honorary
title for services
to the old-boy network.

24:48.282 --> 24:49.826
Bit like mine, then.

24:49.909 --> 24:52.453
Have you seen
young Isobel yet?

24:52.537 --> 24:55.123
She seems to think you've been
cutting down the wood
behind her farmhouse.

24:56.916 --> 24:58.835
Just some coppicing,
that's all.

24:58.918 --> 25:01.421
Apparently you've got cattle
that belonged to her gran.

25:01.504 --> 25:05.174
(CHUCKLING)
What's she going to do
with a dozen Highland cows?

25:05.258 --> 25:07.093
I doubt she's ever
kept anything bigger
than a hamster.

25:10.138 --> 25:12.724
You know,
maybe it would be simpler
if you took over the lease.

25:13.766 --> 25:15.435
She's very attached
to that house,

25:15.518 --> 25:17.562
but, uh, I suppose...

25:17.645 --> 25:19.355
Well, for now,
I've given her a month
to find tenants.

25:20.523 --> 25:21.524
Tenants?

25:22.900 --> 25:26.112
-Excellent idea.
-If she can't, we'll...

25:26.195 --> 25:28.448
We'll sign the lease
over to you.

25:28.531 --> 25:30.074
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

25:32.118 --> 25:34.412
It's good to see a laird
who knows what he's doing.

25:34.495 --> 25:36.372
Is it? You'll have to
point him out to me!

25:37.123 --> 25:38.207
(CHUCKLING)

25:38.666 --> 25:39.834
Jess?

25:57.810 --> 25:59.395
Ah!

25:59.479 --> 26:00.772
Molly, get the rope!

26:02.774 --> 26:04.400
It's Duncan! It's Duncan!

26:04.484 --> 26:07.153
I know it's Duncan.
I just want to see
if it works.

26:07.236 --> 26:08.237
Jess!

26:10.365 --> 26:12.367
What the hell's going on?

26:12.450 --> 26:15.912
Plant rustlers.
Someone's after our orchids.

26:15.995 --> 26:17.622
Wouldn't it be easier
just to lay mines?

26:17.705 --> 26:19.707
Yeah, but it's more fun
this way.

26:22.085 --> 26:23.795
Where did you two spring from,
anyway?

26:34.138 --> 26:36.683
Ooh! Snug, isn't it?

26:36.766 --> 26:39.727
It's only meant for two.
Coffee?

26:40.561 --> 26:42.563
-Oh!
-Sandwich?

26:42.647 --> 26:44.440
Uh...

26:44.524 --> 26:47.193
-Chocolate biscuit?
-Thanks very much.

26:47.276 --> 26:48.778
What are you doing here,
anyway?

26:48.861 --> 26:50.363
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...

26:50.446 --> 26:52.448
(WHISPERING)
Please, keep your voices down.

26:52.532 --> 26:53.866
We don't want to tip them off.

26:54.867 --> 26:57.120
To talk.
I mean, alone talking.

26:58.246 --> 27:00.248
(GASPING)

27:00.331 --> 27:03.251
An osprey!
That's the first one
I've seen this year.

27:09.215 --> 27:11.467
And I heard about
Isobel Anderson.

27:11.551 --> 27:13.261
You know, Archie was keeping
that lease open for her.

27:13.344 --> 27:15.179
Lexie, Archie left.

27:15.263 --> 27:18.266
You went to join him.
I'm the laird now,
and it is my job,

27:19.642 --> 27:21.436
it's my duty,

27:21.519 --> 27:23.271
to run this place
the best I can.

27:25.189 --> 27:26.482
Why are you being so...

27:29.694 --> 27:31.738
You know,
it's like you resent
my coming back.

27:31.821 --> 27:34.157
I just don't know
why you're here.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.201
There's no problem at the bank
that we couldn't have sorted
out for you.

27:37.285 --> 27:38.995
You're getting involved
in everyone's business...

27:39.078 --> 27:40.204
I'm trying to help.

27:40.288 --> 27:41.789
Why do you want Duncan
to go to New Zealand

27:41.873 --> 27:43.207
when you're not even sure
you're going back yourself?

27:53.551 --> 27:55.261
Has something happened
between you and Archie?

27:58.639 --> 27:59.682
No.

28:03.603 --> 28:06.481
Lex, come and go
as you please,

28:06.564 --> 28:07.815
but let me do my job, okay?

28:16.949 --> 28:19.285
( WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?
BY BASEMENT JAXX PLAYING)

28:53.236 --> 28:54.487
(GRUNTING) Ah!

30:03.306 --> 30:04.307
(DOOR OPENING)

30:07.143 --> 30:09.896
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

30:11.230 --> 30:12.607
Did you speak to Jess?

30:12.690 --> 30:13.941
Yes.

30:14.901 --> 30:17.612
(SIGHING)

30:17.695 --> 30:20.490
Unfortunately,
she didn't have a clue
what I was talking about.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.243
And you're normally
so articulate.

30:29.916 --> 30:33.252
I'm just terrified
she'll say no.

30:33.336 --> 30:37.131
I think I frightened her off
once before by being
a bit keen.

30:38.091 --> 30:39.217
Let me see that.

30:41.886 --> 30:43.888
Is that the same ring
you offered to me years ago?

30:43.971 --> 30:44.972
Uh...

30:46.683 --> 30:48.518
I didn't think you'd remember.

30:48.601 --> 30:50.645
I mean,
you hardly looked at it.

30:50.728 --> 30:53.981
No, I checked it out.
I am a girl.

30:54.065 --> 30:55.483
Ah, she'll love it.

30:57.276 --> 30:58.611
You mustn't be afraid.

31:06.327 --> 31:08.204
I want a wild
and romantic wedding.

31:09.122 --> 31:10.206
I should hope so too.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.794
Like the one
you and Archie had
up in the hills.

31:16.921 --> 31:18.840
Making your vows
to stand together,

31:18.923 --> 31:20.299
no matter what happened.

31:22.677 --> 31:25.972
If Jess and I
could have a wedding
as magic as that,

31:26.055 --> 31:27.849
then I'd be
the happiest man...

31:29.934 --> 31:30.935
(DOOR SHUTTING)

32:00.715 --> 32:02.133
MOLLY: No.

32:02.216 --> 32:04.052
You'll not be digging up
any orchids today.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.013
(PARKER MUTTERING)

32:10.099 --> 32:12.185
-Molly.
-Stop!

32:12.268 --> 32:14.145
-He doesn't have a spade.
-Ah!

32:14.228 --> 32:15.730
(COUGHING)

32:16.856 --> 32:17.899
Ah.

32:26.824 --> 32:29.369
PAUL: Molly?

32:29.452 --> 32:32.955
-What's going on?
-I'm afraid Mrs MacDonald
nearly got arrested.

32:33.039 --> 32:35.291
-What?
-She ambushed young Mr Parker

32:35.375 --> 32:37.794
when he was in pursuit
of a radio pirate.

32:37.877 --> 32:40.546
Trussed him up
like a cheap roast.

32:40.630 --> 32:42.715
I'm sure there's
a sensible explanation.

32:42.799 --> 32:45.385
Explanation, yes.
Sensible, no.

32:45.468 --> 32:47.804
Just as well young Parker
reported it to me.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.139
I'll straighten him out.

32:50.223 --> 32:52.183
-Don't worry.
-Thanks, Joe.

32:52.266 --> 32:54.560
Well, while I'm here,

32:54.644 --> 32:57.313
I thought I might just
take you up on your offer.

32:57.397 --> 32:58.981
The lease
on the Anderson farm.

32:59.065 --> 33:00.441
No, I can't, Joe. Not yet.

33:00.525 --> 33:02.318
I gave Isobel a month
to find tenants.

33:02.402 --> 33:05.613
That house
is barely fit for pigs,
never mind people.

33:05.697 --> 33:07.365
Ah, I don't know.

33:07.448 --> 33:09.701
I've got a feeling
she'll manage it,
just to be awkward.

33:09.784 --> 33:13.621
(CHUCKLING) Anyway,
I can see you're a busy man.

33:13.705 --> 33:16.791
All these frisky relatives
running wild in the woods.

33:20.712 --> 33:22.046
Ridiculous little man.

33:23.089 --> 33:25.216
He even wanted
Jess arrested as well.

33:25.299 --> 33:28.678
Molly, you assaulted someone
over a flower!

33:28.761 --> 33:31.597
It's a protected species.

33:31.681 --> 33:34.851
You're the laird, Paul,
it's your duty
to protect Glenbogle.

33:34.934 --> 33:36.936
If you let the orchid go,
what next?

33:37.020 --> 33:38.521
The osprey? The otter?

33:38.604 --> 33:41.774
Every piece of Glenbogle
is a part of the whole.

33:43.651 --> 33:46.154
Yes, it's only a flower,
but when it's gone,

33:46.237 --> 33:48.489
something will be
lost forever,
something priceless,

33:48.573 --> 33:51.075
and all because you were
too pig-headed to listen.

33:58.624 --> 34:01.669
Hiya, Paul.
Have you seen Lexie about?

34:02.253 --> 34:03.338
Sorry?

34:04.714 --> 34:06.507
Uh, no.

34:06.591 --> 34:08.760
-No, I haven't.
-I was just speaking to her
about Archie.

34:08.842 --> 34:10.678
About the day
they got married, in fact,

34:10.762 --> 34:12.764
and then she just ran off.

34:55.889 --> 34:57.308
Isn't this
where you got married?

34:58.226 --> 34:59.519
Yeah.

35:00.561 --> 35:02.730
We made our vows,

35:02.814 --> 35:05.066
he kissed me
and the stars fell
out of the sky.

35:08.152 --> 35:11.072
I thought, "No more heartache,
no more doubt."

35:13.116 --> 35:14.659
I didn't know
much about marriage.

35:17.829 --> 35:19.372
Is that why you asked
Duncan out there?

35:21.874 --> 35:22.917
Because you were lonely?

35:24.127 --> 35:25.962
It wasn't for his
management skills.

35:27.797 --> 35:29.048
(SIGHING) Archie is still...

35:29.632 --> 35:31.009
Archie.

35:31.092 --> 35:34.345
Still full of mad ideas
and going off like a rocket,

35:34.429 --> 35:37.181
with me attached to the stick.

35:38.224 --> 35:40.393
I mean, he'd consult me

35:40.475 --> 35:43.354
and then I'd find out
he'd already made
the decision.

35:43.438 --> 35:45.815
So I told him
to stuff his vineyard
and that I was going home.

35:48.817 --> 35:51.320
-I missed home.
-(THUNDER RUMBLING)

35:52.697 --> 35:54.782
Only, now I don't even know
where home is.

35:57.326 --> 35:58.828
This is your home, Lexie.

36:01.288 --> 36:02.457
It'll always be yours.

36:04.667 --> 36:05.835
More than it'll ever be mine.

36:07.795 --> 36:09.756
Do you still want me here?

36:09.839 --> 36:11.214
Even though I spread sedition?

36:12.550 --> 36:13.718
Of course, I want you.

36:16.596 --> 36:20.098
-I mean, we all want you here.
-(THUNDER CRACKING)

36:24.479 --> 36:25.772
We'd better get off this hill.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.051
(LEXIE YELLING) Oh, god!

37:01.099 --> 37:02.600
It's freezing!

37:02.684 --> 37:04.268
I'll go and get firewood.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.688
-You're soaking.
-I can't get any wetter.

37:06.771 --> 37:09.065
Hey, don't sit down,
keep moving.

37:09.148 --> 37:10.441
Yes, Sergeant Major.

37:11.150 --> 37:12.151
Oh!

37:39.095 --> 37:40.471
Are you dry under that?

37:43.141 --> 37:44.350
Pretty much.

37:46.144 --> 37:48.521
You should take
that jumper off, it's soaking.

37:48.604 --> 37:50.481
-No, I'm fine.
-Here. Come on, don't be daft.

37:53.735 --> 37:56.529
Oh, but that T-shirt's
bogging as well. Here.

38:00.950 --> 38:02.744
I've got an idea. Turn round.

38:06.164 --> 38:08.416
Now just snuggle up behind me.

38:10.043 --> 38:11.210
There!

38:11.294 --> 38:12.462
Okay?

38:12.545 --> 38:14.714
Oh!

38:14.797 --> 38:16.341
-Are you feeling that warmth?
-Yeah.

38:18.009 --> 38:20.803
-We'll move on
as soon as it stops raining.
-(TREMBLING) Oh!

38:20.887 --> 38:23.097
I've seen it rain round here
for a fortnight before.

38:28.186 --> 38:29.437
Listen,

38:30.646 --> 38:33.900
what I was saying
on the hill earlier...

38:33.983 --> 38:37.153
I just couldn't bring
myself to tell anyone,
so thanks for listening.

38:37.945 --> 38:40.156
That's okay.

38:40.239 --> 38:42.241
-I'm not much of a listener.
-(GIGGLING)

38:42.325 --> 38:45.453
-Well, you'll soon get
the hang of that, eh?
-Molly doesn't think so.

38:46.412 --> 38:49.374
She's been tearing
strips off me.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.751
Golly obviously wants to,
but he doesn't say anything.

38:52.752 --> 38:54.295
Golly's rooted in Glenbogle.

38:56.047 --> 38:58.633
Like the mountains.

38:58.716 --> 39:01.344
You know,
a laser pen and a laptop
won't make him a consultant.

39:03.221 --> 39:04.555
I shouldn't be doing this.

39:06.307 --> 39:08.309
You're a better laird
than I'll ever be, Lexie.

39:09.769 --> 39:11.062
You should be laird again.

39:13.272 --> 39:14.399
I can't.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.611
I'm not really here.

39:21.406 --> 39:22.448
Yes, you are.

39:25.702 --> 39:27.495
It's a lovely day
for a barbecue.

39:29.497 --> 39:32.000
Quite a fire
you two have got going.

39:32.083 --> 39:33.626
We, uh...
We got caught in the rain.

39:34.836 --> 39:36.379
It stopped raining
a while ago.

39:55.565 --> 39:58.109
So, no coat?

39:58.192 --> 40:00.570
I thought you would
be better prepared
before you came up here.

40:18.046 --> 40:20.506
Snooty bloody Jemima
and her designer
walking boots.

40:21.507 --> 40:22.675
She seemed nice enough to me.

40:22.759 --> 40:23.801
PAUL: She's unhinged.

40:23.885 --> 40:25.094
Paranoid.

40:25.178 --> 40:27.263
She's convinced Joe Reavey
wants to steal her farm

40:27.347 --> 40:29.223
-and cut this wood down.
-And does he?

40:29.307 --> 40:31.392
No, I've spoken to him.
He's just been coppicing.

40:32.310 --> 40:33.311
What?

40:37.315 --> 40:38.316
(LEXIE EXHALES SHARPLY)

40:40.693 --> 40:42.278
She's not that paranoid, then.

40:51.746 --> 40:55.958
What the hell are you doing?
Get off my land! Stop!

40:59.003 --> 41:00.046
What are you doing?

41:23.653 --> 41:24.737
Hey!

41:28.741 --> 41:31.369
Oi, that's my keys!

41:31.452 --> 41:33.287
-What's going on?
-Like you don't know.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.207
JOE: What are you doing
over here?

41:36.290 --> 41:37.959
Nothing. You told me to...

41:38.042 --> 41:39.752
I said to knock down
that cow shed,
not that cow's...

41:44.215 --> 41:46.718
I meant him to demolish
our old byre.

41:46.801 --> 41:48.261
It's a simple
misunderstanding.

41:48.344 --> 41:50.221
-What, another one?
-I'll pay for any damage.

41:50.304 --> 41:51.431
You wanted to wreck the place

41:51.514 --> 41:53.182
so that I would never
find tenants.

41:53.266 --> 41:54.517
JOE: Oh, come on!

41:54.600 --> 41:56.602
I want you to find tenants.

41:56.686 --> 41:58.021
Tell her, Paul, will you?

41:58.104 --> 42:00.189
Someone's been cutting trees
down in the woods.

42:01.858 --> 42:05.153
Do you not know
what coppicing means?

42:05.236 --> 42:07.989
I'm sorry, Paul,
I'm going to have to take
my boy out and shoot him.

42:09.782 --> 42:11.117
It was an honest mistake.

42:15.329 --> 42:17.874
Just get this thing
out of here, Joe.

42:19.709 --> 42:21.961
Einstein,
get this thing out of here.

42:26.090 --> 42:28.217
Can't you see what he's doing?

42:28.301 --> 42:30.762
He's selling up
the timber from the woods.

42:30.845 --> 42:34.057
And look at this place.
It's more like a demolition
site than a working farm.

42:34.140 --> 42:36.517
It's not a working farm.

42:36.601 --> 42:40.480
It may be a holiday home
if you can find anyone
mug enough to rent it.

42:40.563 --> 42:43.024
If you ask me,
Reavey's doing you a favour.

42:43.107 --> 42:44.359
Then why did you stop him?

42:45.693 --> 42:47.320
Because the laird
made a promise,

42:48.279 --> 42:49.739
and I am going to keep it.

42:53.993 --> 42:56.454
MOLLY: Are you sure
this is going to work?

42:56.537 --> 42:58.790
I did rather get
into hot water last time.

43:08.466 --> 43:10.134
Apart from breaking
an arm, maybe.

43:10.218 --> 43:11.636

45:19.847 --> 45:21.265
things could get
very unpleasant.

45:25.269 --> 45:26.354
After you.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.654
-(DOOR RATTLES)
-PAUL: Who's in there?

45:36.072 --> 45:38.366
Open up! Open the door!

45:40.702 --> 45:41.869
Paul, I'm kind of busy.

45:45.540 --> 45:50.962
-Dear, oh, dear,
this is regrettable.
-Yeah, it is.

45:51.045 --> 45:54.090
-Proud of yourself, are you?
-I'm performing
a public service.

45:57.552 --> 45:59.095
I'm seizing this equipment.

45:59.178 --> 46:01.139
This young man
will have to face charges.

46:01.889 --> 46:03.516
Hold on a minute, Joe.

46:03.599 --> 46:05.393
Strictly speaking,
you should face
charges as well.

46:06.269 --> 46:07.687
It's a sorry business.

46:07.770 --> 46:10.440
If only we could come
to some sort of arrangement.

46:11.190 --> 46:12.233
What do you mean?

46:12.316 --> 46:14.569
Mr Parker, check downstairs.

46:14.652 --> 46:16.112
See if there's any
back-up equipment.

46:16.988 --> 46:18.322
Good idea.

46:20.116 --> 46:22.785
I know that young Isobel
is very fond of that house.

46:23.411 --> 46:24.912
I am too.

46:24.996 --> 46:26.831
I'd hate to see it
go under the rushes.

46:26.914 --> 46:29.667
It won't,
if she finds tenants.

46:29.751 --> 46:31.336
JOE: My Billy will be
the tenant.

46:31.419 --> 46:33.338
Get that nit out
from under my feet.

46:36.591 --> 46:38.259
-(MOUTHING)
-PAUL: What's that?

46:38.343 --> 46:41.054
JOE: A lease for
the Anderson farm.

46:41.137 --> 46:43.639
It's only a few acres
of bog and grass,

46:43.723 --> 46:45.808
but I can make them pay.

46:45.892 --> 46:48.019
What, by destroying
the landscape?

46:48.102 --> 46:50.521
By cutting the woods down
and selling them off
as timber?

46:50.605 --> 46:52.315
Or stealing rare orchids?

46:52.398 --> 46:55.610
What good are trees or flowers
growing wild in the hills,

46:55.693 --> 46:59.155
when there's plenty
of collectors willing to pay
good money for them?

46:59.238 --> 47:01.240
Farmers are an endangered
species too, you know.

47:01.324 --> 47:03.868
You are the most despicable...

47:03.951 --> 47:05.495
JOE: Careful.

47:05.578 --> 47:08.706
You could still face charges
for assault on Mr Parker.

47:08.790 --> 47:12.377
So, Billy was just
following orders.

47:12.460 --> 47:14.170
Sign the lease

47:14.253 --> 47:16.172
and I'll have a word
in the right ear,

47:16.255 --> 47:18.341
and all this will never
have happened.

47:18.424 --> 47:21.344
This is blackmail
and you're supposed
to be the sheriff!

47:21.427 --> 47:23.596
Yes, I'm the sheriff.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.431
What are you
going to do about it, sonny?

47:25.515 --> 47:27.600
There's no
back-up equipment.

47:27.684 --> 47:29.268
You're finished.
Switch it off.

47:29.352 --> 47:30.812
I have switched it off.

47:30.895 --> 47:32.522
-Eh? I'm still
getting a signal.
-(STATIC)

47:32.605 --> 47:33.815
Stop blithering.

47:33.898 --> 47:35.274
I've pulled the plug out.

47:35.358 --> 47:37.110
Actually, that's the charger.

47:38.069 --> 47:39.529
This rig runs off batteries.

47:42.699 --> 47:43.783
We're live.

47:43.866 --> 47:45.284
-(BEEPING)
-Oh, and what's this?

47:46.077 --> 47:48.371
215 e-mails.

47:48.454 --> 47:50.081
We should do more
of this current-affairs stuff.

47:51.708 --> 47:54.669
Yes, ladies and gents,
we're talking today, live,

47:54.752 --> 47:56.254
to Sheriff Joseph Reavey,

47:56.337 --> 47:58.339
live and exclusive on Rob Roy.

47:58.423 --> 48:00.341
So, Sheriff Reavey,

48:00.425 --> 48:03.636
tell us more about
your unconventional
approach to conservation.

48:03.720 --> 48:05.304
Now, that's what I call
a public service.

48:13.730 --> 48:16.107
What's that?

48:16.190 --> 48:17.817
I know
it's not an airline ticket.

48:17.900 --> 48:19.027
Lexie told me.

48:19.902 --> 48:21.821
What did she tell you?

48:21.904 --> 48:24.323
She offered you
a job out there
and you turned it down.

48:26.117 --> 48:27.410
Is that all she told you?

48:27.493 --> 48:28.661
Why didn't you take it,
Duncan?

48:28.745 --> 48:30.455
It would have been amazing.

48:30.538 --> 48:33.249
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

48:33.332 --> 48:35.001
It's just... I mean...

48:35.084 --> 48:37.462
(STAMMERING)
I'm scared of flying.

48:38.588 --> 48:39.797
Is it us?

48:39.881 --> 48:42.425
-The reason you said no?
-No!

48:42.508 --> 48:45.970
No, not at all.
I mean, obviously, well...

48:46.846 --> 48:47.889
(STAMMERING) Yeah.

48:49.807 --> 48:50.808
Yeah.

48:51.976 --> 48:53.353
Yeah, it was.

48:53.436 --> 48:56.731
Duncan, you shouldn't let me
stand in your way.

48:58.691 --> 49:00.318
I mean,

49:00.401 --> 49:01.861
I like us being together.

49:03.738 --> 49:04.906
It's fun.

49:06.699 --> 49:09.327
But I'm not up
for a big commitment.

49:11.662 --> 49:13.748
I sound like a problem page.

49:13.831 --> 49:15.875
No, no, not at all.

49:15.958 --> 49:19.712
I mean, I'm just the same.
I mean, live for now.

49:19.796 --> 49:21.047
A day at a time.

49:22.423 --> 49:24.300
Now I sound
like a problem page.

49:34.185 --> 49:36.604
Thank you
for saving my farm.

49:38.189 --> 49:40.191
You won't sub-let it.

49:40.274 --> 49:41.984
You'd have to be deranged
to live here.

49:43.444 --> 49:44.821
I must be deranged, then.

49:46.072 --> 49:47.699
Hold on,

49:47.782 --> 49:50.034
I thought you had some
high-powered job
back in Edinburgh?

49:50.118 --> 49:52.120
I did, yeah. But I quit.

49:53.746 --> 49:56.499
So, you reckon
you'll make a farmer?

49:56.582 --> 49:58.084
Why not?

49:58.167 --> 49:59.460
They made you the laird.

49:59.544 --> 50:01.754
(CHUCKLING)

50:01.838 --> 50:04.048
Looks like we'll both
have some awkward
cows to deal with.

50:05.133 --> 50:06.467
(COWS MOOING)

50:15.101 --> 50:16.310
Good luck.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.988
GOLLY: May the open hand
be filled the fullest.

50:28.448 --> 50:32.577
May the loving heart
ne'er know strife.

50:32.660 --> 50:35.747
As St Bride
brings warmth to the water,

50:35.830 --> 50:37.915
may this spring
bring the land new life.

50:39.917 --> 50:41.919
And may we be one clan,

50:42.003 --> 50:44.297
mother and daughter,
father and son,

50:45.631 --> 50:46.924
husband and wife.

51:09.906 --> 51:11.115
(LEXIE AND MOLLY CLAPPING)

51:17.413 --> 51:19.040
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

51:34.889 --> 51:36.265
-Hello.
-Hi.

51:39.811 --> 51:42.522
-Do you want my jumper?
-No, thanks. I'm all right.

51:44.273 --> 51:46.359
So, are they growing
on you yet?

51:46.442 --> 51:48.611
PAUL: I haven't got
any earplugs in,
if that says anything!

51:48.695 --> 51:50.071
(LEXIE CHUCKLING)

51:50.154 --> 51:51.489
I miss them.

51:51.572 --> 51:53.199
Especially in New Zealand.

51:54.450 --> 51:56.285
I suppose, hearing them now,
I just feel...

51:57.745 --> 51:59.539
-Happy?
-Home again.

52:01.708 --> 52:03.042
At last.

52:06.713 --> 52:09.632
PAUL: I saw Golly
doing the blessing.

52:09.716 --> 52:11.634
If you don't mean it,
it doesn't mean anything.

52:14.721 --> 52:17.807
I just don't get it,
that's all.

52:19.267 --> 52:21.310
Everybody seems to, except me.

52:21.394 --> 52:24.731
You will. In time.

52:24.814 --> 52:27.608
I didn't make you laird, Paul,
I can't.

52:27.692 --> 52:30.987
You know, it's not something
that you can give or take,
it's just something

52:31.821 --> 52:35.158
(SIGHING) you become.

52:35.241 --> 52:37.285
-I'm trying,
it's just that I'm...
-Scared?

52:39.120 --> 52:40.204
Scared?

52:40.705 --> 52:41.706
No.

52:46.252 --> 52:47.337
Yeah, you are.

52:48.504 --> 52:49.922
But knowing you,
you'll do it anyway.

52:54.052 --> 52:55.136
I'm glad you're home, Lexie.
