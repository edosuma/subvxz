17:19.805 --> 17:23.844
But you're coming with me, Dan.
You have to tell Eric what you said.

17:23.884 --> 17:26.204
No, I don't. He can't cope as it is.

17:28.509 --> 17:32.959
Dan Anderssen, I have orders to arrest
you and bring you in for questioning.

17:45.486 --> 17:47.148
You don't need the gun, Petra.

17:59.195 --> 18:00.534
You're not leaving.

18:02.075 --> 18:03.880
You'll bleed again.

18:03.915 --> 18:06.884
He's getting stronger, the demon.

18:06.941 --> 18:09.456
So little time left. It has to be stopped.

18:09.491 --> 18:11.665
The police are looking for you.

18:11.712 --> 18:12.571
(HE GRUNTS)

18:12.627 --> 18:18.426
They think you killed Tavra and
that geologist. Vladek, did you?

18:20.061 --> 18:22.840
I am not your problem.

18:23.086 --> 18:24.055
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

18:29.212 --> 18:33.253
Tavra killed himself because he had to.

18:34.635 --> 18:38.395
I killed the geologist because
he couldn't kill himself.

18:44.275 --> 18:45.761
Is that true?

18:46.787 --> 18:48.922
It is if you believe me.

18:50.835 --> 18:54.354
If you have faith in me.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.330
Do you, Freya?

18:59.152 --> 19:00.595
I don't know.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.282
- Your money.
- What?

19:07.345 --> 19:09.533
You wanted some cash from the bank.

19:09.604 --> 19:12.148
For Kim Hopperstad to fix the hole.

19:12.183 --> 19:14.499
But you couldn't be
bothered going yourself.

19:14.534 --> 19:16.189
Kim'll see you there at four.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.221
Why can't you go?

19:17.256 --> 19:21.159
It's dangerous. Road's full of holes.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.513
Perhaps I should find
myself a younger assistant.

19:24.571 --> 19:26.225
I'm not dead, you know.

19:26.986 --> 19:28.255
It won't be long.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.291
Not fucking deaf either.

19:31.652 --> 19:35.172
For God's sake, Ingrid!
Elena cannot just disappear.

19:38.236 --> 19:39.309
Keep looking.

19:41.108 --> 19:43.014
Look what I found by the harbour.

19:44.195 --> 19:45.503
Hello, Eric.

19:51.755 --> 19:52.617
Dan.

19:54.156 --> 19:57.874
I'm trying to find a man who
has killed a lot of people here.

19:58.857 --> 20:03.594
But I can't do that until
I know Elena is safe.

20:03.595 --> 20:07.177
You know where she is. Help me.

20:11.075 --> 20:12.517
Help her.

20:22.795 --> 20:27.634
Dan, don't make me lock you up.

20:27.703 --> 20:29.180
What are the charges?

20:29.231 --> 20:30.914
You broke into Khatri's house.

20:30.915 --> 20:32.035
To cook her a three course meal.

20:32.101 --> 20:33.560
It was a fucking home invasion!

20:33.595 --> 20:34.837
I stacked the dishwasher.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.750
You put a flare gun in her face.

20:38.801 --> 20:39.851
It wasn't loaded.

20:39.894 --> 20:41.975
Dan, please.

20:47.962 --> 20:51.617
Dr. Khatri's pressing
charges... threatening behaviour,

20:51.679 --> 20:55.153
breaking and entering,
assault with a deadly weapon.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.518
You'll be taken to Oslo for
a trial. Put him in a cell.

21:04.155 --> 21:06.035
I'm entitled to a phone call.

21:32.155 --> 21:33.795
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

21:54.996 --> 21:57.234
Why didn't you tell Eric what you told me?

21:57.881 --> 21:58.959
Hmm.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.563
I didn't think he'd listen.

22:03.284 --> 22:04.389
I know!

22:06.572 --> 22:12.892
I told him... I think the killer's
a Shaman, Dan... but he won't listen.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.526
He's out of his depth.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.100
Go on.

22:22.813 --> 22:27.178
There's a legend among the people
here... that every few generations

22:27.213 --> 22:31.533
the Gods send down a plague to
remind everyone of their power.

22:32.190 --> 22:36.727
And after the plague, a,
a sort of demon rises up.

22:36.795 --> 22:42.500
The chosen one... and he can only
be defeated by a powerful magic,

22:42.555 --> 22:45.332
and for that, the Shaman
needs certain body parts.

22:45.899 --> 22:50.327
And that's what I think is
happening here: the husky, the heads,

22:50.362 --> 22:51.166
the heart...

22:51.236 --> 22:56.759
Someone is collecting body parts because
they think there is a monster here.

22:59.091 --> 23:00.368
A monster?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.172
It's only superstition, of course.

23:08.195 --> 23:12.737
But if we can understand
his way of thinking, then...

23:12.788 --> 23:15.128
We can predict his moves.

23:16.315 --> 23:17.376
That's it!

23:29.702 --> 23:34.554
Against my advice, Dr. Surinder Khatri
has agreed to speak to you in private.

23:46.628 --> 23:50.640
If you drop the charges,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

23:51.716 --> 23:53.036
How does that sound?

23:59.148 --> 24:02.614
Hey. Can I get a hand putting
the Ski-Doos on the trailer?

24:05.861 --> 24:08.418
- Did I interrupt something here?
- No.

24:11.925 --> 24:13.797
Gotta admit, I had my doubts about her.

24:13.855 --> 24:17.746
But after getting to know her for
a few days, she's pretty great.

24:17.802 --> 24:19.441
She's not my girlfriend.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.719
Just saying.

24:22.246 --> 24:23.966
Don't embarrass me. Okay?

24:24.564 --> 24:29.274
Hey, I told your mother
we're going hunting. Okay?

24:29.355 --> 24:30.144
Alright.

24:32.323 --> 24:34.015
Did you eat something?

24:34.627 --> 24:36.369
We're wasting daylight.

24:44.381 --> 24:47.575
Don't you be doing anything
stupid while I'm gone.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.160
She came out of the coma
yesterday, quite suddenly.

25:22.195 --> 25:22.994
No brain damage?

25:23.035 --> 25:25.298
She was dirsorientated and violent.
I had no time to examine her.

25:25.372 --> 25:27.331
But, wasn't she
effectively on life-support?

25:27.395 --> 25:29.674
It's a miracle, Doctor Yelburton.

25:29.675 --> 25:31.057
Why did she attack you?

25:31.109 --> 25:32.249
- Be happy.

But... most of all, err...

26:52.995 --> 26:55.395
most of all, I'm, I'm upset.

27:00.901 --> 27:05.948

don't love me any more.

Yes. Eric, it's important.

Erling Munk is corrupt.

mobile phone he keeps in his room.

to see his former secretary.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.196
She's also his mistress.

28:12.282 --> 28:16.030
She told me he has a second
property, something he could

28:16.065 --> 28:18.290
never afford on a government salary.

28:18.325 --> 28:21.834
He keeps a sports car there in a garage.

Everything in a different
name, some relative of his.

Munk in the car at the house.

need counseling or something.

emails that he wrote, they prove...

- they prove that...

can't trust anyone here.

I'm the only one you can trust.

end up like the others.

32:34.545 --> 32:36.011
Are you making fun of me?

No. That's what happened.

32:41.152 --> 32:43.181
That's what happened to people here.

32:44.385 --> 32:46.100
And it happened to me too.

32:47.105 --> 32:51.915
After I thought I'd killed
you, I had a couple of drinks.

32:52.514 --> 32:55.354
A few days later, I woke up here.

32:56.185 --> 32:59.880
And by then, the voices were inside me.

33:00.410 --> 33:05.843
I could hear them talking to me,
whispering to me, telling me what to do.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.830
The voices.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.196
And I knew I'd do it.

35:49.347 --> 35:52.107
It was brilliantly done, of course.

was doing, and about how Eric was

the car you keep out there.

36:55.327 --> 36:59.883
I'm very sorry, Erling.
How did it all start?

37:00.525 --> 37:03.619
It's not too late, you
know. I can help you.

37:03.692 --> 37:05.204
You can help me.

37:08.355 --> 37:09.826
I'm not going to the Police.

37:09.889 --> 37:12.373
I don't care about the
money, or who you work for.

37:12.408 --> 37:14.394
I care about Fortitude.

37:15.254 --> 37:19.828
So here's my deal: you resign
the governor's job, you find some

37:19.870 --> 37:22.931
excuse, and you go home to Oslo.

37:23.010 --> 37:28.839
In return, I forget
everything, this all goes away.

Give me your hand.

Pull me up... quick!

Quick!

38:28.294 --> 38:29.364
Erling!

38:29.624 --> 38:35.184
It starts off small, and then you're
in, and they won't let go of you.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.553
I'm trapped, Hildur.

38:40.967 --> 38:41.952
Ah!

38:43.881 --> 38:48.557
I'm in up to my head. Like you said.

38:48.664 --> 38:53.173
No. Erling, we can, we can
work it out, we... Please.

38:53.963 --> 38:57.115
Please. Please.

39:03.223 --> 39:04.234

39:04.305 --> 39:05.920
No! (GASPS)

39:05.973 --> 39:07.196
I can't do it.

39:07.635 --> 39:08.484
No.
