EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #073
Closed Captioned

00:04.505 --> 00:06.340
CHRIS ROCK:
Becoming manager
of the football team

00:06.374 --> 00:07.675
had its perks.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.910
I wasn't exactly part
of the cool crowd,

00:09.943 --> 00:12.646
but I did get
to be around them.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.849
Hey, yo, Chris, this
milk smells funny.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.618
Taste this, and tell
me if it's spoiled.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.055
Yeah, it's spoiled.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.324
Yeah, I thought so.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.558
Anyway, like I was saying.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.960
Taimak is gonna be
the next Bruce Lee.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.429
Taimak?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.299
You mean Taimak from The Last
Dragon

00:31.332 --> 00:33.067
No, Taimak from CNN.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.302
Yeah, that's right.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.836
I love that movie.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.471
After The Last Dragon,
karate became

00:37.505 --> 00:39.640
more popular
in the ghetto than poverty.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.775
Everybody was doing it.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.478
Boys were doing karate.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.679
Girls were doing it.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.181
GIRLS:
Yah!

00:49.016 --> 00:50.318
Even old people were doing it.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.790
He's not doing karate--
he's just crazy.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.427
Hey, we're going to
see a midnight show
in Times Square.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.794
You can come if you want.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.496
No, I can't.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.497
Midnight?

01:03.531 --> 01:04.832
Yeah, what's the matter?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.400
Past your bedtime?

01:06.434 --> 01:07.401
Yes!

01:08.502 --> 01:10.204
Nah. I just...
I just had this party

01:10.238 --> 01:11.672
I was supposed
to go to, but...

01:11.705 --> 01:13.341
you know, I guess
I can skip that.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.342
All right, cool.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.509
We'll see you there.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.044
Not at midnight you won't.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.361
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:33.394 --> 01:37.398
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:51.712 --> 01:53.046
Wow, I can't believe
you're going to go to see

01:53.080 --> 01:55.115
The Last Dragon with
Dickerson and his crew.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.850
You are so in there.
No, Greg, I'm not

01:56.884 --> 01:58.786
My parents aren't gonna let
me see a midnight movie.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.053
Then why'd you say yes?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.855
Because I didn't want
to look like some punk

02:01.889 --> 02:03.757
who can't get out of
the house past 9:00.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.293
But since you are,
what are you gonna

02:05.326 --> 02:06.827
tell them after
you don't show up?

02:06.860 --> 02:09.197
That I got sent to jail for
killing my nerdy white friend?

02:09.230 --> 02:11.031
While I was planning
a good excuse.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.401
My dad was planning
my mom's anniversary.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.403
What's up, everybody?
Hey, hey, youngblood.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.004
Where's Manny?

02:17.037 --> 02:18.539
He's opening another
shop, in Detroit.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.873
When did you start
cutting hair?

02:19.907 --> 02:22.276
When we were kids everybody
in our house had a job.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.511
Ryan was the barber.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.678
Yeah. So, Julius, where

02:24.712 --> 02:27.014
are you taking Rochelle
for her anniversary tonight?

02:27.047 --> 02:29.750
We're going to see
Show Dogs on Broadway.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.652
Show Dogs?
What's that about?

02:31.685 --> 02:32.986
It's only the most
extravagant musical

02:33.020 --> 02:35.989
ever to come to the United
States from a foreign shore.

02:36.023 --> 02:40.728
It's a high-voltage
spectacle of song and dance!

02:40.761 --> 02:41.762
ALL:
Ooh...

02:41.795 --> 02:43.130
Is that all?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.667
No, girl. We're gonna have
dinner at Domaine et Mer,

02:46.700 --> 02:48.369
and we're spending a night

02:48.402 --> 02:51.004
at the Times Square
Regency Hotel.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.674
Ooh, a hotel. Not a motel.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.843
Oh, no, I don't do
outside hallways.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.678
Oh, that sounds good.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.347
I was married once.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.549
For our anniversary,
he took me to a Knicks game.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.217
I broke up with
him at halftime.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.220
And ended up going home
with Bernard King.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.022
Between this hair
and my Armando Vermani bag,

03:09.056 --> 03:11.525
I don't think I'm-a be
able to stand myself.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.061
Ooh, ooh.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.929
While my mom was
gearing up to go out,

03:15.963 --> 03:17.365
I was bailing out
to stay in.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.032
Hey, Dickerson, I can't
make it to that movie tonight.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.434
It's my cousin's birthday

03:20.468 --> 03:22.703
and she's really counting
on me to be at the party.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.238
All right, man, but
you're missing out.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.239
Next time.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.241
Yeah, maybe.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.244
And maybe I'll never
get invited out again.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.713
All right, well,
I hope you feel better.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.081
Get some rest.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.585
Who was that?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.587
Gloria. She got a fever.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.722
She won't be able to
watch the kids tonight.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.393
What? Oh baby.
I can't believe this.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.061
That was $150 worth
of show tickets.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.799
Uh-oh. She's about to do
a dramatic head turn.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.933
Told you.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.736
Show tickets?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.405
What about our anniversary?

03:57.438 --> 03:59.072
Well, that's what I meant.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.609
We won't be able to use those
$150 worth of show tickets

04:01.642 --> 04:03.744
to celebrate our anniversary.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.112
Sidney Poitier had nothing

04:05.145 --> 04:07.548
on my father's acting
abilities.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.517
And the award for "Best Husband

04:09.550 --> 04:11.619
"Acting Like He Was Sad
About Not Going Out

04:11.652 --> 04:14.087

goes to...

04:17.090 --> 04:18.826
Julius!

04:20.328 --> 04:22.563
Julius,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.797
Oh, my God!

04:29.470 --> 04:30.538
What's wrong?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.272
I thought you guys
were going out.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.141
The sitter canceled,
and my anniversary is ruined.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.109
Other than that,
everything is fine.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.745
If this was a cartoon,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.847
you'd see a lightbulb
appear above my head.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.181
I can watch Drew and Tonya,

04:41.214 --> 04:42.816
and you and Dad
can still go out.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.320
Chris, this is not for a few
hours; it'll be all night.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.721
Ma, I can handle it.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.723
Well, what if Drew gets a fever?

04:49.757 --> 04:50.791
I'll call a doctor.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.292
What if Tonya sets
something on fire?

04:52.326 --> 04:53.561
I'll call the Fire Department.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.828
What if somebody
tries to break in?

04:54.862 --> 04:55.663
I'll call the police.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.130
What if you get
attacked by ghosts?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.166
I'll call Ghostbusters.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.938
Ma, I can do it.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.575
I mean, I know how much you've
been looking forward to this

05:07.608 --> 05:10.678
and I wouldn't want you
to miss it because of us.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.748
And the award for
"Best Kid Pretending

05:14.782 --> 05:16.984

"So He Can Sneak Out And Do

05:21.955 --> 05:24.458
goes to... Chris!

05:28.295 --> 05:30.297
Chris, ladies
and gentlemen.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.101
Oh... Thank you, Chris.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.804
I'm gonna go get ready.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.707
That left only
one thing for me to do.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.942
Hey, Dickerson.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.277
Yeah, good news;
the party got cancelled,

05:44.311 --> 05:45.513
I'll see you guys at the movies.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.747
Hey, who's this?
Who's on the line?

05:46.780 --> 05:50.150
It's Chris...
the football team manager.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.185
From Tattaglia.

05:52.219 --> 05:57.491
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.127
While my parents got ready
for their big night out,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.496
I got ready
for my big sneak-out.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.665
Hey, Drew, Tonya--
Chris is in charge.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.800
I want y'all to be
on your best behavior.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.301
If Chris accidentally
catches on fire,

06:08.335 --> 06:10.303
jumps out a window
to fan out the flames

06:10.337 --> 06:12.372
and falls to his death,
is he still in charge?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.307
No, then Drew is in charge.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.609
Boy, what are you doing?

06:15.643 --> 06:16.977
I'm gonna get
on That's Incredible

06:17.010 --> 06:18.211
by using my psychic powers

06:18.245 --> 06:19.312
to bend this spoon.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.981
Not with my good
silver you're not.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.416
Go mind-bend a spork
or something.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.984
Chris, you know
what to do.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.152
Yeah, I got
everything covered.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.153
I got
all the emergency numbers--

06:26.186 --> 06:29.156
Fire, Police, SWAT, FBI,

06:29.189 --> 06:32.125
CIA, IRS, NAACP,
and the NBA.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.061
In case
Chris Mullin breaks in.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.296
Bye.
All right...

06:36.329 --> 06:38.198
Bye.
...we'll be back
in the morning.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.102
While my parents
were at the play,

06:42.135 --> 06:44.271
I was getting ready
to make a play.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.144
That's not incredible,
that's just stupid.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.455
She sleeps like an angel
but acts like the Devil.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.131
I love you, baby.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.033
This is going to be the
best anniversary ever.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.802
I know.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.314
Hey, um, no, no, I--

07:27.347 --> 07:28.716
No, hey--

07:28.749 --> 07:32.452
He was-- he was--
he's okay.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.588
I'm so embarrassed.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.725
While my father had stopped
the show before it started,

07:37.758 --> 07:40.761
I was starting to think
Dickerson was a no-show.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.769
Chris?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.844
Chris.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.619
The idle sister
is the Devil's workshop.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.623
Even though nobody showed,

08:09.657 --> 08:12.693
I figured since I was out,
I may as well go in.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.027
Forget this.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.840
That's what happens
when you talk over the trailer

08:26.874 --> 08:29.209
for Three Men and a Baby.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.083
The next day,
I pulled a Robert Blake

08:36.116 --> 08:38.619
and tried to forget
all about the shooting.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.487
Make sure it's tight, Tonya.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.855
Isn't this
how Houdini died?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.157
No, Houdini died from
secondary peritonitis

08:44.191 --> 08:46.794
due to a ruptured spleen from
being punched in the stomach.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.562
Hey, kids.
Hi.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.131
DREW & TONYA:
Mom, Dad.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.199
Oh...

08:52.232 --> 08:53.734
Hi, baby.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.235
So... Chris,

08:55.268 --> 08:56.469
how did it go?

08:56.503 --> 08:57.938
Great, fine,
never been better,

08:57.971 --> 08:59.573
smooth as silk.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.408
With a bullet hole in it.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.543
So how was the play?
Well, we never saw it

09:03.577 --> 09:05.579
because we got
kicked out

09:05.613 --> 09:07.881
because your dad knocked
out one of the actors.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.983
You knocked out
one of the dogs?

09:10.017 --> 09:11.151
He snuck up on me.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.686
You were
in a theater,

09:12.720 --> 09:13.887
not an alley.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.756
Hey, look at this.
A guy got shot

09:15.789 --> 09:16.890
last night right
down the street

09:16.924 --> 09:18.125
from where you
guys saw the play.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.493
Oh... too bad we
didn't go see a movie.

09:20.527 --> 09:24.064
Maybe your dad could have
knocked out the shooter.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.099
Did they catch the
guy who did it?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.134
Nope.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.936
How do you get shot
in a movie theater

09:28.969 --> 09:30.570
and not have
any witnesses?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.706
Because nobody wants
to be a snitch, that's why.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.574
What do you mean?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.043
In the early days
in the black communities,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.678
people enjoyed telling
on each other.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.847
You couldn't do anything
without getting caught.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.184
Who did this?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.252
He did.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.790
Thousands of criminals
were sent to jail

09:49.823 --> 09:51.124
by law-abiding citizens.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.159
Thanks.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.761
No problem.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.128
It wasn't until those people
got out of jail

09:55.162 --> 09:56.930
and started killing the people
that sent them there...

09:56.964 --> 09:59.032
...that snitching got a bad rep.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.173
Who did this?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.941
I don't know.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.609
Wasn't me.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.178
MAN:
I didn't see nothing.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.682
When dinner was finished,
Tonya was just getting started.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.949
I know what you did.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.951
Words no man ever wants
to hear a woman say.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.019
What?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.821
What did I do?
You know.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.555
You snuck out
of the house last night.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.624
Prove it.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.830
Busted.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.567
Okay, how much do you want?

10:34.601 --> 10:35.736
$50.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.771
$50?!
That's my whole week's pay.

10:37.805 --> 10:38.772
It's either that
or Momma's going

10:38.806 --> 10:40.107
to smack the sneak
out of you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.209
Fine.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.082
How long was that?

10:49.116 --> 10:50.884
Two minutes
and 15 seconds.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.920
Dang.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.423
I was getting found out
at home

10:56.456 --> 10:58.058
and finding out things
at school.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.459
Hey, Chris.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.394
What happened at the
movies Friday night?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.197
We couldn't make it, but
I heard somebody got shot.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.598
Somebody got shot?

11:05.632 --> 11:06.599
Yeah.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.735
Oh, well,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.302
I wouldn't know, 'cause...

11:09.336 --> 11:10.771
I didn't go.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.773
Hold up-- you
stood us up?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.607
But you just said
that you didn't go.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.544
It don't matter-- if
we invite you someplace

11:17.577 --> 11:19.279
we expect you to show up.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.647
That's just rude, man.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.315
Sorry.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.817
Too bad we didn't go.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.152
If we had seen
that shooting,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.787
we'd be collecting that
reward money right now.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.288
Reward money?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.422
Yeah.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.358
The cops are offering
a thousand dollars

11:31.391 --> 11:33.260
to anybody who can
identify the shooter.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.527
Thousand dollars?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.196
What are you, a parrot?
A parrot?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.431
Yeah, every time I say
something, you say it?
I say it?

11:38.465 --> 11:41.468
Anyway, I'll
catch you later.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.970
Catch you later.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.305
Don't stand us up again.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.142
In the meantime,
the silent treatment

11:49.176 --> 11:51.845
was ringing
in my father's ears.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.184
Oh, come on, honey.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.186
It's been three days.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.622
How long you gonna keep
giving me the silent treatment?

12:06.326 --> 12:08.461
You ruined my
anniversary--

12:08.495 --> 12:09.629
I'd say about a year.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.799
He'd like to go for two.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.066
Why is it always
my responsibility

12:13.100 --> 12:14.835
to make sure
the anniversary is good

12:14.868 --> 12:16.870
while you get to sit back
and complain?

12:16.904 --> 12:19.406
I spent money
on dinner, tickets,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.341
a hotel, and what do I get?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.710
$250 worth of angry stare.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.146
Nowadays that stare
costs over a thousand.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.181
Okay, Mr. Hurt Feelings,

12:28.215 --> 12:31.584
exactly what is it that
you want me to do?

12:33.787 --> 12:36.957
ROCHELLE:
Happy anniversary!

12:36.990 --> 12:38.859
The J Beauties again?!

12:38.892 --> 12:41.728
Have fun, baby--
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.698
Hi.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.968
Now, you just had
to push it, didn't you?

12:48.001 --> 12:50.037
My mother didn't even want
my father's dreams

12:50.070 --> 12:52.472
to run off with a white woman.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.641
Back at school,
I was wondering how to collect

12:54.674 --> 12:57.044
a thousand dollars without
collecting a bullet in my back.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.012
You can't do it, man--
you have any idea

12:59.046 --> 13:01.181
what they do to snitches
in the joint?
Do you?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.883
Yeah, I do--
my Aunt Patricia told me.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.084
Your Aunt Patricia
was in jail?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.286
Yeah, but that was when
she was still my Uncle Pat.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.088
Trust me, dude,
you do not want to snitch.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.857
I don't know, man,
I got to do something.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.825
There's a thousand dollars
with my name on it.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.293
Whatever you do,
don't include me.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.728
And if anybody asks, this
conversation never happened.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.132
To get that cold, hard cash,

13:19.166 --> 13:20.968
I needed someone
to take the heat.

13:21.001 --> 13:25.138
So, all I got to do
is go into the police station,

13:25.172 --> 13:26.573
give a description
of the guy,

13:26.606 --> 13:28.808
they give me a thousand dollars,
and I could keep half?

13:28.842 --> 13:30.577
Right.
No, thanks.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.246
I ain't trying
to be no snitch.
Oh, no, no, no.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.082
See, you're not snitching,

13:35.115 --> 13:36.283
I'm snitching.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.550
You're just collecting
the snitch money.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.752
Hmm...

13:39.786 --> 13:42.389
Okay, I'll do it--
but don't tell nobody.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.291
What you think I am, a snitch?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.825
Yes.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.761
Hey.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.137
You got the money?
They said I get it as soon
as they arrest the guy.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.939
So, you told them
about the red shirt

13:58.972 --> 14:00.874
and two-tone shoes and
the stingy brim hat?
Yep.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.876
It was either a black guy
or Justin Timberlake.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.577
Then I picked him
out of a lineup.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.713
You did what?!
I picked him
out of a lineup.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.049
You never saw him-- what if
you picked the wrong guy?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.683
Hey, it happens to me
all the time.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.885
Hold it right there.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.321
You're under arrest.
Wha... Wha... What?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.990
Falsifying a police report,
obstruction of justice.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.026
Back then police still cared

14:19.059 --> 14:21.929
about arresting
the right person.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.171
At the barbershop, rumors
about Jerome were spreading

14:31.204 --> 14:33.340
faster than Britney Spears
for the paparazzi.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.675
Cannot believe Jerome snitched.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.046
Ain't nothing they hate more
in jail than a snitch.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.413
There's a few things
they hate more,

14:40.447 --> 14:41.949
but let's say snitching's
in the top five.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.616
Man, I know a dude
that committed suicide,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.885
didn't leave a note, 'cause
he didn't want to be a snitch.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.854
Is it really that bad in there?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.057
Nah, prison is fun.
You guys don't think
they'll kill him, do you?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.095
Don't look at me!

14:55.128 --> 14:58.231
I don't know nothing.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.670
Back home, my father hoped
some special treatment

15:03.703 --> 15:05.672
would end
the silent treatment.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.775
Julius, what the heck are
you doing here in the dark?

15:08.808 --> 15:12.946
I'm giving you
your anniversary back.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.149
Julius, this is amazing.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.851
You did all of this for me?

15:18.885 --> 15:20.187
And there's more.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.922
I got you two tickets
to Show Dog tonight.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.992
I have to work,
but you can take Vanessa.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.259
Well, what about the kids?

15:26.293 --> 15:27.961
Chris stayed with them
the other night.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.662
He could take care
of them again.

15:29.696 --> 15:33.600
Oh, baby, this is the best
make-up anniversary ever.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.268
Translation:

15:35.302 --> 15:38.438
you blew it once,
don't let it happen again.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.273
My father was
out of the doghouse,

15:40.307 --> 15:44.211
but Jerome was still stuck
in the big house.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.679
Hello?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.215
Little dude
from across the street?

15:48.248 --> 15:51.151
Jerome?
Yo, you got to get me
out of here, man.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.419
People think I'm a snitch.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.853
And how am I supposed
to do that?

15:53.886 --> 15:55.222
I ain't no snitch,

15:55.255 --> 15:57.790
so even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.260
All I know is
I'm in here because of you,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.130
so either we both gonna be out
or we both gonna be in.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.897
You decide.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.404
I had to sneak out
of the house,

16:11.438 --> 16:14.407
but as always, one little thing
stood in my way.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.409
Tonya.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.245
What?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.180
I have to go out, and
I don't want you to tell.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.714
How much?
Ten dollars,

16:21.748 --> 16:23.716
plus you do laundry
on my next turn.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.286
Deal.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.455
Down at the police station,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.123
I needed to get Jerome out

16:30.157 --> 16:32.159
without getting myself
thrown in.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.096
What can I do
for you, son?

16:36.129 --> 16:37.630
I got a question.
How can I get someone out

16:37.664 --> 16:38.965
of jail who shouldn't
be in jail?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.300
Two ways.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.435
You got to post bail or
they got to be innocent.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.437
Well, what if they're
in jail

16:44.471 --> 16:46.439
for giving information
that was wrong.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.474
Well, then bring
us the person

16:47.507 --> 16:48.508
with the information
that's right.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.509
You mean a snitch?

16:49.542 --> 16:52.512
I like to call them "the
law's little helpers."

16:52.545 --> 16:54.447
Is there something you
want to tell me?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.283
I had run out of options.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.551
The only way to get Jerome out
of that dirty jail

16:58.585 --> 16:59.886
was to come clean.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.154
Okay.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.723
Meanwhile, my mother celebrated
her anniversary

17:03.756 --> 17:05.392
the way my father dreamed it
Thank you.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.993
with Vanessa.
Ooh, it's about
to start.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.028
Okay, ooh, ooh.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.939
Ooh!
Damn it!

17:19.972 --> 17:21.774
Vanessa!
I-I know...

17:21.808 --> 17:24.444
And that's why black people
hate Broadway.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.446
What y'all looking at?

17:26.479 --> 17:28.448
After trying to not snitch
on someone else,

17:28.481 --> 17:30.450
I had to finally snitch
on myself.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.784
Man! Little dude!

17:31.818 --> 17:33.820
Am I glad to see you.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.257
You're lucky your story
checked out, son.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.925
Your friend could've
gotten hurt in there.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.727
You guys would have protected
him, right?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.561
No.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.729
And don't try

17:42.762 --> 17:44.063
running games
on us again.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.565
We do this stuff
for a living.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.834
Am I going to jail?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.503
You seem like a decent kid and
there was no real harm done...

17:50.537 --> 17:52.305
Besides that guy that got shot.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.906
...so we're gonna forget
this happened.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.176
Now you, you seem
like a criminal.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.977
That's because he is.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.479
But we're gonna let
you go, too.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.413
He'll be back.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.082
You're lucky we got
bigger fish to fry.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.917
Now, don't you knuckleheads
let me catch you

18:04.951 --> 18:06.686
doing anything like
this again.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.355
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.822
Little dude,
you snitched?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.291
Yeah.
Thanks.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.560
That day I learned
people don't like it

18:13.593 --> 18:15.228
when a snitch puts them
in jail,

18:15.262 --> 18:16.563
but they sure don't mind it

18:16.596 --> 18:18.598
when a snitch gets them out.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.370
That week my mother
got another surprise.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.405
Hello, ma'am.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.340
Yes, can I help you?

18:27.374 --> 18:28.608
You must be Chris's mom.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.809
Uh, may I come in?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.879
Sure.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.481
As I'm sure you're aware,

18:34.514 --> 18:36.216
last Friday at the
midnight movies,

18:36.249 --> 18:37.984
Chris was a witness
to a shooting.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.052
He was?
Yes.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.488
And the valuable information
he gave us

18:41.521 --> 18:43.290
led us to the arrest
of the perpetrator.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.324
Wait, hold on.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.892
Last Friday

18:45.925 --> 18:47.860
Yes. You didn't know?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.729
No.
Well,

18:49.762 --> 18:51.097
anyway, I'm just here

18:51.130 --> 18:53.433
to personally deliver
this reward of $1,000

18:53.466 --> 18:55.268
and to thank him.
Is he around?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.769
He's around.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.805
But I'm not sure
how much longer.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.341
Officer, thank you
so much for coming by.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.243
I'll be sure that
he gets this.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.411
Of course.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.446
Thank you for
your time.
Mm-hmm.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.155
If you don't mind
me asking...

19:16.189 --> 19:17.757
What in the world
is he doing?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.793
Well, he's trying to get
on That's Incredible.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.631
Son, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

19:24.664 --> 19:26.299
but That's Incredible
has been off the air

19:26.333 --> 19:27.434
for two years now.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.868
They're called
reruns.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.770
The only thing that hurt more
than Drew's feet

19:30.803 --> 19:33.473
was my sore behind after my mom
gave me a whoopin'.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.809
But the next day, I was just
glad everything was behind me.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.812
Yo, little dude from
across the street.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.348
I heard they caught
the shooter

19:41.381 --> 19:42.515
and you got paid.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.184
I did my part, so
where's my $500?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.185
My mom took it.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.186
You can ask her for it.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.521
Nah, nah, man.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.922
My deal was with you.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.391
Well, I don't have it.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.059
Well, then
looks like

19:53.092 --> 19:55.061
you're just gonna have to
give me a dollar a day

19:55.094 --> 19:57.063
for the next...

19:57.096 --> 19:58.598
* Can you see them?

19:58.631 --> 20:03.670
* See right through them...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.272
500 days?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.807
I was gonna say 50.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.009
Well, that's what you
get for snitching.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.944
Now, let me hold a dollar.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.518
* Our lips are sealed.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.622
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.393
