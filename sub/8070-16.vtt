[MUSIC PLAYING - ED STARINK,
ROSEANNE THEME SONG]

00:51.685 --> 00:54.054
[music playing]

00:54.155 --> 00:58.058
Darlene, we got you now.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.560
You what?

00:59.660 --> 01:00.661
Letter from your school.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.696
Darlene's in trouble.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.764
Darlene's in trouble.

01:03.864 --> 01:04.665
Nya, nya.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.434
Nya, nya nya nya nya.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.768
One

01:07.868 --> 01:10.638
You wanna tell us right away
before we find out anyhow?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.840
All right, I cut Spanish
class, but it's not my fault.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.576
I mean, Meryl forgot to
wake me up after biology.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.446
OK, well, you got
dishes for an extra week,

01:18.546 --> 01:19.647
then, young lady.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.549
Dear Mr. Conner, the
Lanford Board of Education

01:21.649 --> 01:25.886
invites you to share your
career skills with our students.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.822
If you are interested,
la da da da da.

01:28.922 --> 01:33.427
Doesn't say anything about
skipping Spanish class.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.463
Well, I guess that
makes me a moron.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.465
Guess so.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.733
Hi.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.735
Darlene, you're
wearing my shirt.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.037
Get off my back, I
got bigger problems.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.273
Why, what's going on?

01:45.373 --> 01:47.007
Career day at junior high.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.909
They want Dad to
come down and speak.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.313
Oh, bummer, Darlene.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.214
He wouldn't do it.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.548
He's too cool.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.449
That's me.

01:55.549 --> 01:59.553
Ice D. Too cool for school.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.423
You know what kind of makes
me mad about this whole thing?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.958
Is how come it's just like,
automatically made out to you

02:05.058 --> 02:06.194
and not me.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.896
Well, honey, I am the
professional of the family.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.030
All right.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.302
I forgot about your
master's in drywalling.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.603
You know the real reason, Dan.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.070
It's just 'cause you're a man.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.408
Oh, God, she's
going feminist on me.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.075
You know, what, like
I'm not good enough

02:22.176 --> 02:25.479
for their little junior high
school career day, you know?

02:25.579 --> 02:28.349
Like some housewife doesn't
have anything important to say?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.284
Well, it's an outrage, Mom.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.119
I mean, I say you go down
there, and you show 'em

02:32.220 --> 02:34.087
how tough your job really is.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.558
Well, maybe I will.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.328
Thank you, Becky.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.630
Well, maybe next time you'll
keep your grubby little paws

02:42.730 --> 02:45.533
off my stuff.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.369
Mom, you're not going to let
some blonde bimbette tell you

02:48.469 --> 02:50.037
what to do.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.004
What is your problem?

02:51.104 --> 02:53.106
Are you embarrassed
of your mother?

02:53.207 --> 02:54.508
Don't get offended, Mom.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.978
I'm just embarrassed of Dad.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.315
Hah, you're just saying that.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.116
Hey, DJ.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.652
What's, uh, in the bag?

03:04.752 --> 03:05.553
Nothing.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.224
Well, thanks for
giving him a ride home.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.826
Yeah, I suppose you
want a free dinner now.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.127
You're welcome.

03:14.228 --> 03:18.799
Uh, Roseanne, can I alk-tay
with ou-yay in ivate-pray?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.605
OK dokay.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.975
Durrr, I, I don't understand
what they're talking about,

03:28.075 --> 03:28.876
do you?

03:33.781 --> 03:35.416
So, what's up?

03:35.516 --> 03:38.185
This is in the
strictest of confidence.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.954
DJ has a little problem.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.155
Huh, yeah.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.291
Where've you been, Jackie?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.192
No.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.960
I mean there's some
bully school has been

03:47.060 --> 03:48.262
threatening to beat
him up unless he

03:48.362 --> 03:50.364
brings him a Twinkie every day.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.565
Are you sure?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.000
Yes, he made me
buy him a whole box.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.635
That's what's in that bag.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.471
But remember, this is
just between you and me.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.740
Right.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.141
DJ!

04:01.241 --> 04:04.412
Oh, Roseanne, I promised him
I wasn't going to tell anybody.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.547
Well, you lied.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.448
Yeah?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.249
What is this about, ah--

04:09.350 --> 04:12.720
you're having some problem
at school with some bully?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.187
Deej, I'm sorry.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.589
She forced it out of me.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.490
Wuss.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.227
Deej, what's going on?

04:20.328 --> 04:21.562
It's OK.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.398
As long as I give Kevin more
than two Twinkies every day

04:24.498 --> 04:25.333
he won't beat me up.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.634
No, it's not OK.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.669
You can't go through life
giving in to bullies.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.039
But I wanna live!

04:32.139 --> 04:33.507
Well, I'm going
to call the school.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.975
- No.
- No, you can't do that, Rose.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.310
Everyone'll think
he's a squealer.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.578
Yeah, then he'll
really get the cream

04:37.678 --> 04:40.314
cheese kicked out of him.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.182
Well then, Not going to
call this kid's parents.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.984
No, don't do that,
he's gonna beat me up!

04:44.084 --> 04:45.719
He's gonna beat me up!

04:45.819 --> 04:47.421
Well, what am
I supposed to do?

04:47.521 --> 04:49.590
Well, I'm going to have to
teach the kid how to fight.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.958
Come on, Dan.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.860
DJ's just a little tiny boy.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.698
You know, size isn't really
the issue here, Roseanne.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.299
Uh, back when I
was on the force--

04:59.400 --> 05:01.735
Here we go.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.871
No, I'm just saying that if
you know what you're doing,

05:03.971 --> 05:05.839
anybody can take out anybody.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.676
You know, I could put Dan
on the floor right now,

05:08.776 --> 05:11.645
if I wanted to.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.447
Yeah.

05:13.547 --> 05:17.751
And you could sprout little
pink wings and fly away.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.987
What, you don't think I can?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.889
Dan, I was a cop.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.660
Take your best shot, Officer.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.368
Yaaaaa!

05:34.468 --> 05:37.605
Gaaaaah!
- Ow, ow.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.641
She pulled a hair out.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.242
See?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.377
I'm gonna go up
and teach the kid

05:43.477 --> 05:44.778
how to take care of himself.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.315
Oh, Dan, you know if DJ tries
to fight, he'll just get hurt.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.517
Don't worry.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.753
I'll make it clear that
fighting isn't the answer.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.223
Once you're sure you can win.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.527
Meantime, I'll just keep
him stocked up in Twinkies.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.396
Well, I guess I'll get this
place cleaned up for you.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.065
I'll just start by tossing
this letter from the school.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.900
Eh, might as well, I guess.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.636
Aw, all right, Mom.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.603
What's the matter?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.972
Darlene having
problems at school?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.107
Not yet.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.245
[music playing]

06:18.345 --> 06:22.249
All right,
everybody, listen up.

06:22.349 --> 06:26.420
Today, we are very lucky to
have as our guest speaker

06:26.520 --> 06:30.691
a woman who chose to make
home economics her life.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.761
I want you all to welcome
Mrs. Roseanne Conner.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.366
Here, kill me.

06:39.467 --> 06:44.271
Mrs. Conner has been a wife
and a mother for 17 years.

06:44.371 --> 06:47.708
And she's come to us today to
present a sort of common sense

06:47.808 --> 06:49.777
approach to home economics.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.179
Mrs. Conner.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.114
OK, well.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.148
Um, OK.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.216
Well, OK.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.551
You know how a lot
of people don't think

06:57.651 --> 07:00.488
that being a housewife is
very important and everything,

07:00.588 --> 07:01.755
but OK.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.191
A lot of people depend
on you, you know?

07:04.291 --> 07:06.994
And you got to be really
smart, and really dedicated.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.395
You know.

07:08.496 --> 07:13.534
Well, it's kind of like being
a doctor, only, you know, um--

07:13.634 --> 07:16.003
the hours are longer, and
you don't get any pay,

07:16.103 --> 07:20.073
and, um, it's way bloodier, so.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.209
It's probably not like
being a doctor at all.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.245
Well, anyway, any
questions, or-- ?

07:25.345 --> 07:26.446
Yes, Darlene.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.414
May I be expelled?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.954
No, Darlene.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.355
You got a question?

07:35.455 --> 07:39.026
What did you really
want to do with your life?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.294
Well, I tried,
you know, lounging

07:41.394 --> 07:43.230
on the beaches of
Europe, but somehow

07:43.330 --> 07:44.331
that just left me empty.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.036
Now, believe this
or not, I mean, I

07:49.136 --> 07:51.471
really wanted to have a family.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.973
Maybe not the one I got, but--

07:55.475 --> 07:56.409
you know.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.079
What's What's your
favorite soap opera?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.114
Well-- you know,
I don't do that.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.449
Is that what you
think that, you know,

08:02.550 --> 08:04.652
you just watch soap operas
and all that kind-- you know--

08:04.752 --> 08:05.686
OK.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.188
Raising a family--
well, it's a career.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.256
OK?

08:09.356 --> 08:13.360
It's kind of like
managing a factory.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.663
Now she manages a factory.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.930
No, no.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.666
This is going to be way
better than the doctor thing,

08:18.766 --> 08:19.567
trust me.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.734
Way better.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.135
OK.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.139
Like, I think of my kids like
they're the product, right?

08:26.239 --> 08:28.341
And if I can get them
out there on the market

08:28.441 --> 08:34.748
without them getting returned
defective, then I got my job.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.183
Well, what you
think you could teach

08:36.283 --> 08:38.085
us that we couldn't learn here?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.888
Well, what are
you learning here?

08:40.988 --> 08:44.558
Ooh, well, yesterday we
baked a quiche Lorraine.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.458
No, really.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.127
Yes.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.998
We think it's very important to
learn how to follow a recipe.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.800
And, uh, well,
we've also learned

08:52.900 --> 08:54.501
how to make our own clothes.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.369
Oh, well.

08:56.469 --> 09:00.507
How very Little
House on the Prairie.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.776
Well, I don't know anything
about, like, that kind

09:02.876 --> 09:04.077
of home economics, OK?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
The only thing I know
about is, like, you know,

09:06.313 --> 09:09.249
cleaning and shopping and
cooking for a family of five

09:09.349 --> 09:11.551
on a really, really
tight budget, you know,

09:11.652 --> 09:13.587
and still having enough
money left over to buy

09:13.687 --> 09:15.355
that all-important aspirin.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.757
You know.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.125
So.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.928
Well, I don't even know if I
could teach it in class here.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.663
I think we ought to
go on a field trip.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.464
Cool!
[chatter]

09:24.564 --> 09:26.634
Well, I think that
is a great idea,

09:26.734 --> 09:28.936
so why don't you kids
all get permission

09:29.036 --> 09:31.972
from your parents to spend an
afternoon with Mrs. Conner?

09:32.072 --> 09:32.873
Yeah!

09:32.973 --> 09:33.774
[chatter]

09:33.874 --> 09:35.809
Oh, Mom.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.544
Oh, no, that's OK, Darlene.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.980
You can go.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.950
[music playing]

09:46.987 --> 09:48.856
Now, weren't there
some boys in this class?

09:48.956 --> 09:49.990
They didn't wanna come.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.625
Yeah, they think
shopping is a girl thing.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.527
Oh, well, get used to that.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.163
Can we get this
over with, please?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.732
Come on, now, Darlene,
this can be fun.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.968
Here, honey, you can
ride in the seat.

10:03.771 --> 10:09.176
[music playing]

10:09.276 --> 10:10.077
What's the big deal?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.311
It's just the Buy And Beg.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.213
It's not like we haven't
been here a million times.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.083
It's not just the
Buy And Beg, Darlene.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.951
The supermarket
is the very blood

10:18.051 --> 10:19.519
and guts of home economics.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.055
And besides, it's what
makes our country great.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.824
Where else in the
world are you going

10:23.924 --> 10:28.195
to find frozen pizzas, microwave
pizzas, French bread pizzas,

10:28.295 --> 10:31.164
thick crust pizzas,
pizza puffs, pizza rolls,

10:31.264 --> 10:34.134
pizza squares, pizza tarts?

10:34.234 --> 10:37.838
Did I tell you you should never
shop when you're really hungry?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.106
All right, girls.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.508
The mission is meat.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.210
You're making dinner
for five people

10:43.310 --> 10:45.412
and you're on a
really tight budget.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.980
Uh, what's your name?

10:47.080 --> 10:47.881
Meryl.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.149
Meryl, all right.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.151
Step on up to the meat
counter there and pick a meat,

10:51.251 --> 10:53.286
any meat.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.155
All right, let's see.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.257
There's a lot of meat in here.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.127
Some veal, some chicken--

11:00.227 --> 11:02.830
Yeah, but OK: you got
four loads in the laundry,

11:02.930 --> 11:04.197
and you've got a
sink full of dishes,

11:04.297 --> 11:05.933
and your husband gets
really, really cranky if he

11:06.033 --> 11:06.867
has to wait for his dinner.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.969
You gotta move, move, move!

11:09.069 --> 11:09.937
All right, here.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.404
God.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.107
So, girls, let's
see what Meryl picked.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.308
New York steak.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.576
hmm?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.079
So what does your
dad do for a living?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.513
- He's a dermatologist.
- Oh.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.949
Then that would
be a good choice.

11:24.852 --> 11:28.255
Anybody here who doesn't
have a trust fund?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.191
Darlene, what are we
going to have for dinner?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.893
Well, I'm eating
at Meryl's house.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.866
Who wants to see a picture of
Darlene dressed up like a tulip

11:38.966 --> 11:40.067
for her third grade play?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.072
Oh, not me.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.775
Where is that brown garbage?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.743
Here you go.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.744
Yes, girls.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.379
Ground beef.

11:52.479 --> 11:56.149
The stuff that gives
meatloaf its bulk.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.986
But meat's supposed
to be bad for you. r

11:59.086 --> 12:00.553
Yeah, well, so are
Kool Pops, but you've

12:00.653 --> 12:02.655
got to draw the line somewhere.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.025
Let's roll.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.028
Darlene, you stay
here with Mommy.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.262
Why.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.732
Because I just said you're
gonna be teacher's pet.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.135
[music playing]

12:17.771 --> 12:18.906
So, all right.

12:19.006 --> 12:19.807
There we go.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.608
Cornflakes, girls.

12:21.708 --> 12:25.278
The most important ingredient
in tonight's entree.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.746
Why do we need that?

12:26.847 --> 12:27.915
Well, how else
do you think we're

12:28.015 --> 12:29.616
going to turn two
pounds of ground beef

12:29.716 --> 12:34.254
into 11 pounds of
mouthwatering meatloaf?

12:34.354 --> 12:38.091
And the leftovers
stay crunchy in milk.

12:38.191 --> 12:38.992
All right, suck-up.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.062
Hand me a box there.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.430
Oh, nay.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.233
That's the name brand.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.134
Hah.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.235
Here, Meryl.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.136
Bon appetit.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.373
We have to go for the generic.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.910
Why, it's nothing but
second best for our family!

12:57.010 --> 12:57.911
Wait a minute.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.780
My cereal at home
is the name brand.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.050
Now, see, it's just
a name brand box,

13:03.150 --> 13:11.358
and I've been refilling it with
the cheap stuff since 1985.

13:11.458 --> 13:15.829
You mean I've been eating
generic Frankenberries?

13:15.929 --> 13:19.299
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way, sugar.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.201
So anyways, all right,
we got our hamburger,

13:21.301 --> 13:23.570
we got our cornflakes,
we got our potatoes.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.838
I say we roll, huh?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.239
Well, what about a vegetable?

13:26.339 --> 13:27.140
Catch up.

13:30.844 --> 13:34.381
Darlene, go pick up a couple
boxes of Twinkies over there.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.983
How do they save you money?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.150
Oh, they're for my brother.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.487
Cheaper than karate lessons.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.255
OK, now we're going
to go check out,

13:42.355 --> 13:44.124
so do you all have your coupons?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.225
Yes.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.094
And did you all rub
off the expiration date

13:47.194 --> 13:48.361
like I told you to?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.396
Yes.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.630
All right, we're
on a tight schedule.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.531
Let's roll.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.366
[music playing]

13:53.466 --> 13:56.269
Yes, girls, this here
is the checkout line,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.171
and this is where you'll
be spending the majority

13:58.271 --> 14:01.274
of your adult life.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.443
And this here is where
they really try to get you.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.344
See?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.379
It's all about impulse buying.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.981
But you've got to try
to resist the impulse.

14:08.081 --> 14:12.019
You gotta say to yourself,
I do not need anything here.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.955
I do not need anything here.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.926
'Cause everything that's
here are Tootsie rolls.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.894
God, do you believe this?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.362
That woman is,
like, on every cover

14:22.462 --> 14:24.464
of every one of these papers.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.532
Hmm, check it out.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.735
She put a voodoo curse
on her ex-husband.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.203
She's a damn good
singer, though.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.708
Hey, look what this
here guy's buying.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.679
Vodka, Mallomars,
and a TV guide.

14:39.779 --> 14:44.151
I'm thinking, single
and staying that way.

14:44.251 --> 14:51.491
[music playing]

14:59.967 --> 15:02.302
Oh!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.137
Well, girls, this
is some of what

15:04.237 --> 15:07.074
you're going to be feeding.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.742
Are you sure we bought enough?

15:09.842 --> 15:10.643
In the kitchen.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.520
Roseanne.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.421
What's going on?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.722
Who are all those girls?

15:22.822 --> 15:23.991
Well, they're ours, dearest.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.593
Don't you remember?

15:26.693 --> 15:27.961
My God, how long
have I been asleep?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.763
Sleep

15:30.863 --> 15:32.132
All right, all
right, you girls.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.333
All right.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.468
This is where we're
going to turn all

15:35.568 --> 15:38.071
of these fine and
dandy ingredients

15:38.171 --> 15:39.606
into a lovely meal
that will make

15:39.706 --> 15:44.077
your family look you right in
the eye and say, let's eat out.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.013
You write this down.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.216
OK, take that meat,
and the cornflakes,

15:49.316 --> 15:52.919
and the tomato sauce, garlic
salt, salt, and a couple eggs,

15:53.020 --> 15:55.055
you know, and mush them
all up and everything.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.992
And then, put it right
here in this cake

15:59.092 --> 16:01.894
pan with the brown and
black stains on the bottom

16:01.995 --> 16:04.897
and cook it at 375.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.399
All right, girls,
there you have it.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.870
A nutritious meal for five, plus
two lunches, for only $12.73.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.939
Cheaper than fast food,
faster than cheap food.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.576
And that is what I
call home economics.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.877
How long do we cook it?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.547
Still the oldest kid comes
down and whines, Oh, God,

16:20.647 --> 16:23.016
not meatloaf again.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.118
All new when you're ready.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.819
Hey, wait a minute.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.388
I don't see why I
have to be stuck

16:28.488 --> 16:31.158
in this kitchen killing myself
cooking dinner for this family.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.059
Yeah!

16:32.159 --> 16:34.427
[chatter]

16:34.527 --> 16:38.398
This is a proud, proud,
proud, moment for me, girls.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.469
Now you're sounding
like real housewives.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.471
[music playing]

16:47.540 --> 16:50.143
Jeez, I can't believe they're
in there cooking us dinner.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.544
Yeah, awesome, isn't it?

16:51.644 --> 16:52.812
You think they'd
tune up the truck

16:52.912 --> 16:53.946
for a little extra credit?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.616
Well, I suppose that
depends on how nice

16:56.716 --> 16:58.918
you're going to be the teacher.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.853
Mmmmm.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.755
Excuse me.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.624
What kind of salad dressing
would you like, Mr. Conner?

17:08.961 --> 17:11.698
I don't know.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.133
Nobody has ever
asked me that before.

17:16.169 --> 17:19.206
Oh, you're just
confusing him now, Susie.

17:19.306 --> 17:20.273
Orange or red, Dan?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.174
Oh, orange.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.678
Yeah, It's a
Thousand Island in the,

17:25.778 --> 17:28.515
ah, door of the
fridge out there.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.583
Now, where were we, my pet?

17:30.683 --> 17:31.718
Appetizers.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.625
Oh, nobody needs to see that.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.530
Oh, someone just
pulled in our driveway.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.332
- Who?
- I don't know.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.299
He looked angry.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.800
[doorbell rings]

17:47.900 --> 17:48.701
You want to get that?

17:48.801 --> 17:49.602
OK.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.178
- Conner?
- Possibly.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.213
I'm Jim Morgan,
Kevin Morgan's father.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.549
Hey, that's the kid that's
been beating up on DJ.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.584
Yeah, well, that's
not the way I hear it.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.219
My kid came home
with a fat lip today.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.588
He said if he didn't bring two
Twinkies to your kid tomorrow,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.890
he's going to get it again.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.593
So, you're saying that
DJ was beating up your kid?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.494
That's terrible!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.899
DJ, come on down here now.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.701
Yeah, step on it, killer.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.504
Don't make any sudden moves,
we don't want to get him riled.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.405
Yeah?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.708
Come over here.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.976
This is the kid?

18:30.076 --> 18:32.712
DJ, uh, this is
Kevin Morgan's dad.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.148
Uh-oh.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.816
He says you've been
beating on his kid.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.819
Is it true?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.120
Wait a minute,
something's wrong.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.423
Kevin could take this kid apart.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.857
DJ, what's going on?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.559
Kevin was picking on me.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.895
So I got somebody
else to pick on him.

18:48.995 --> 18:49.929
What do you mean?

18:50.029 --> 18:50.897
I had a bodyguard.

18:50.997 --> 18:54.467
It cost me one
Twinkie every day.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.535
My God, Dan.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.238
It's the famous Twinkie defense.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.439
I don't buy it.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.873
Why wouldn't he just tell
me about this bodyguard?

19:00.973 --> 19:01.774
Well, hold on.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.009
Who's the bodyguard, Deej?

19:03.109 --> 19:06.279
Maxine Spencer.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.148
Well, enough said, huh, Morgan?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.117
That is one twisted
little kid you got there.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.754
Hey, that twisted little kid
was just defending himself.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.523
Your kid started
the whole thing.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.296
I want you to call this off.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.465
Not until you
call your kid off.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.999
Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

19:27.099 --> 19:29.068
Whoa, settle down,
or I'll give my wife

19:29.168 --> 19:30.370
a donut to kick your butt.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.280
I'm out of here.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.620
All right, Einstein!

19:47.720 --> 19:48.521
Dan.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.422
What?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.590
Don't encourage him.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.426
Kid's a genius!

19:53.526 --> 19:56.329
He's an extortionist.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
So, what, now I'm
buying Twinkies

19:58.365 --> 20:00.667
for Maxine instead of Kevin?

20:00.767 --> 20:01.868
No.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.504
I told Kevin I'd call
Maxine off if he gives me

20:04.604 --> 20:08.308
two Twinkies every day,
then give one to Maxine,

20:08.408 --> 20:09.208
and eat the other one.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.610
It doesn't cost you anything.

20:14.947 --> 20:15.748
He is a genius.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.620
What are you doing out here?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.290
Well, I just wanted to tell
you that I learned something

20:23.390 --> 20:24.724
kind of important today.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.727
Your job is important,
and it's tough.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.396
So I'm going to
make a lot of money,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.831
or I'm gonna marry a rich guy
so I don't have to do any of it.

20:34.901 --> 20:39.238
Ah, the student surpasses
the teacher, grasshopper.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.077
- Oh, God, not meatloaf again.
- It's ready!

20:48.080 --> 20:50.550
After you, godfather.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.019
[music playing]

20:58.090 --> 20:59.826
Rose?

20:59.926 --> 21:00.727
Rosie.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.264
Honey.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.165
Rose?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.133
Aaaah!

21:07.233 --> 21:08.635
I told you, Dan!

21:08.735 --> 21:10.102
Size means nothing!

21:10.202 --> 21:11.103
Rosie!

21:11.203 --> 21:13.072
Aaah!

21:13.172 --> 21:15.542
Gaah!

21:15.642 --> 21:19.979
[wheezing] [gargling]

21:32.892 --> 21:37.497
If you start to black
out, tap me twice.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.398
Want a beer, Jack?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.732
Not right now.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.233
[groaning]

21:43.736 --> 21:44.837
You give up?

21:44.937 --> 21:45.738
You give up?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.206
Oh.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.577
[yelling]
