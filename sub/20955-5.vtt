WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.570
CAMILA: Previously
on "Queen of the South"...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.172
Whoa!

00:04.205 --> 00:05.206
We need to ship cocaine
up the coast.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.174
You're going to help us.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.675
Divorce papers.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.077
You sign this,
I'll leave you in peace.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.744
Divorce or war?

00:10.778 --> 00:12.880
Then war it is.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.315
So what's this all about?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.150
You and your people
will work for me.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.718
Yeah, but you want a war,
I'll give you--

00:17.751 --> 00:18.986
(gunshot)

00:19.019 --> 00:21.055
MAN: Boaz is a wild card.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.256
Guero?

00:22.290 --> 00:23.857
You're the rat?

00:23.891 --> 00:24.825
CAMILA:
But you knew he was alive.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.160
No.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.595
Then we only have
one hole to dig.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.197
You do need a new supplier,

00:29.230 --> 00:30.431
and I can connect you with one.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.599
It's El Santo.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.033
You need to go to Bolivia.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.573
(eerie music)

00:39.607 --> 00:46.280
*

00:47.281 --> 00:49.117
Is he as bad as they say?

00:49.150 --> 00:52.553
El Santo--Epifanio
was always terrified of him.

00:52.586 --> 00:56.023
Yeah, Epi, back in '95,
he did this deal with Igor,

00:56.056 --> 00:57.758
the Russian, for a large
shipment of Kalashnikovs,

00:57.791 --> 00:59.793
and he didn't realize
El Santo was involved.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.062
The crate got seized
by U.S. Customs.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.031
Epi, he didn't want to pay;
he came home

01:04.064 --> 01:05.899
and found his entire house staff
strung up like wet laundry.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.468
What did Epifanio do?

01:08.436 --> 01:09.737
He paid.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.539
*

01:11.572 --> 01:13.107
Here.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.042
Those seats have covers
on them.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.111
Cut it open.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.212
TERESA: Why?

01:18.246 --> 01:19.647
So we don't get robbed

01:19.680 --> 01:21.215
like a bunch
of gringo tourists.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.584
TERESA: Your connect, Leo,
can we trust him?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.919
Leo's the best in Bolivia.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.288
Give me back my knife.

01:27.321 --> 01:32.793
*

01:32.826 --> 01:35.062
(phone ringing)

01:35.095 --> 01:37.498
I've been trying to get
ahold of you for two days.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.967
I had to shake the DEA
before I got to Bolivia.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.337
Went Fast and Furious
on their asses.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.273
Yeah, La Paz
ain't changed much.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.275
We're almost at
the meet point now.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.411
I want to thank you for agreeing
to use your boats for this run,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.012
for your loyalty.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.448
GEORGE: This ain't about
loyalty, Señora.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.284
I almost lost two good men
in your clumsy little tango

01:56.317 --> 01:57.918
with the feds.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.920
This is about finishing
what we started.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.089
I understand.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.692
I'm prepared to offer a 10%
increase on our arrangement.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.094
No, let's call it
a gentlemanly 20,

02:07.127 --> 02:08.629
and also I'm gonna have to put

02:08.662 --> 02:10.631
a little clock
on this here arrangement.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.835
You and your people
got 72 hours to get the goods

02:14.868 --> 02:17.004
to the border,

02:17.037 --> 02:20.874
or me and my boats
are Cambodia-bound.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.777
Fine. Three days.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.979
But if you leave early,
I will hunt you down

02:26.013 --> 02:28.382
to the ends of the Earth,
Your Highness.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.319
Con un chingo
de respeto, Señora.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.788
I think I see
your power trio right now.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.524
(phone beeps)

02:38.192 --> 02:39.360
(tires squeal)

02:39.393 --> 02:42.463
Welcome to La Paz, bitches!

02:42.496 --> 02:43.397
(thudding)

02:43.431 --> 02:44.665
Come on!

02:47.901 --> 02:49.370
These are the papers
you'll need

02:49.403 --> 02:51.705
to get your coke
through to the border.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.474
We're supposed to be
from Chile?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.142
Chillax, teen dream.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.710
You ain't doing
a funny accent or nothing.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.546
Can we do it in three days,
you think?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.348
If your El Santo connect
is legit,

03:00.381 --> 03:01.515
eh, it should be fine.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.517
It's legit.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.085
We'll meet with
my connect at the bar,

03:05.118 --> 03:06.220
we'll get to El Santo,
and then we are

03:06.254 --> 03:07.821
out of La Paz and gone.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.089
Keep your wits about you, girl.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.558
This ain't Culiacán.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.059
Spiders in this web,

03:12.092 --> 03:15.496
they ain't the kind
that wait for the fly.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.497
There's your bar.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.698
Get to it.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.400
And loosen up a little.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.935
You three blend in
about as much as a piranha

03:21.969 --> 03:23.937
at a poodle party.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.940
(upbeat electronic music)

03:26.974 --> 03:33.981
*

03:38.419 --> 03:41.221
It's a cocaine-cocktail bar.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.792
Tourists come here
to party 24/7.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.427
Why the fuck
are we meeting here?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.128
Why not just meet
at the police station,

03:48.161 --> 03:50.531
give him a challenge?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.765
Where's your connect?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.701
What does he look like?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.369
You see them?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.137
Look, I don't want
to spook him off, okay?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.239
I'll go take a look.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.875
You guys just wait here.

04:01.909 --> 04:06.880
*

04:06.914 --> 04:08.816
Fuck that.

04:08.849 --> 04:15.856
*

04:17.090 --> 04:19.527
(indistinct
Spanish conversations)

04:25.366 --> 04:29.937
(gun cocks)

04:29.970 --> 04:31.605
Hola, mi amor.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.242
Leo, it's been a minute.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
(gun cocks)

04:37.311 --> 04:39.112
Leo?

04:39.146 --> 04:41.515
She's Leo?

04:41.549 --> 04:44.518
(dramatic music)

04:44.552 --> 04:45.553
*

04:51.659 --> 04:54.662
(upbeat electronic music)

04:54.695 --> 04:58.432
*

04:58.466 --> 05:01.602
I told you,
if I ever saw you again,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.471
I'd kill you.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.473
*

05:05.506 --> 05:07.107
I don't know what this is about,
but whatever it is--

05:07.140 --> 05:08.809
Step back, puta.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.778
This is between me
and lover boy.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.179
Leo...
(speaking Spanish)

05:12.913 --> 05:14.648
Shit, Leo!

05:14.682 --> 05:17.785
We have $100,000 for you
to connect us to El Santo.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.488
It's either this or a bullet.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.557
Fine.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.393
I'll spare him.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.694
But only because
I know you're gonna

05:26.727 --> 05:28.862
get skinned alive anyway.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.364
Are you gonna make
the introduction or not?

05:30.398 --> 05:31.365
Are you willing to die
to meet him?

05:31.399 --> 05:32.833
We know the risks.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.301
Show me the finder's fee,
guapo.

05:34.334 --> 05:41.341
*

05:42.910 --> 05:44.344
You sure this is all you want?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.346
I told you why we were coming.

05:46.380 --> 05:51.752
*

05:51.785 --> 05:53.587
I'll make the call.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.656
Are you an idiot?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.157
Why the hell didn't you tell us
Leo was your ex-girlfriend?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.026
We don't have options
down here.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.528
It's the only chance we got
at getting to El Santo.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.195
We're here on business,
all right?

06:02.229 --> 06:03.497
Whatever happened between us
is not important.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.065
It's not important?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.935
She's probably calling
the hit squad right now.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.102
She wouldn't do that.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.939
*

06:11.972 --> 06:15.108
Does she know about me?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.410
No, of course not.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.045
*

06:18.078 --> 06:19.312
It's done.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.716
What now?

06:22.750 --> 06:25.218
(snorts)

06:25.252 --> 06:27.421
*

06:27.455 --> 06:29.289
We wait.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.292
(solemn music)

06:32.325 --> 06:38.932
*

06:38.966 --> 06:41.101
You said it was an emergency.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
Walk with me.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.075
What's this about?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.744
This arrived at my office
this morning, care of me.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.580
Open it.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.653
The mail clerk that opened that

06:59.687 --> 07:01.254
saw the white powder,

07:01.288 --> 07:02.422
thought it was anthrax.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.458
He almost called the FBI.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.833
I'm sorry.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.569
My husband sent this to you
to screw with me.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.405
He knows your firm is handling
my trawler company.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.741
The feds are literally
combing through my garbage

07:20.774 --> 07:22.442
looking for something,
anything,

07:22.476 --> 07:24.645
to connect you to the cartels.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.316
I don't do...
sloppy, Camila.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.554
You don't deserve this.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.624
I'll take care of it.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.127
This will never happen
again, okay?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.963
Just trust me.

07:42.996 --> 07:47.267
(dramatic music)

07:47.300 --> 07:49.169
(sighs, mutters in Spanish)

07:49.202 --> 07:50.337
(upbeat electronic music)

07:50.370 --> 07:53.040
LEO: (snorting, sighs)

07:53.073 --> 07:55.275
*

07:55.308 --> 07:56.677
Thank you.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.046
(snorts)

07:59.079 --> 08:03.617
*

08:03.651 --> 08:06.620
When are El Santo's people
showing up?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.121
(giggles)

08:08.155 --> 08:11.191
(La Luz's "Call Me in the Day"
playing)

08:11.224 --> 08:13.160
(sighs)

08:13.193 --> 08:15.228
I love this song.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.631
(women vocalizing)

08:17.665 --> 08:20.033
WOMAN:
* Before the sun goes down

08:20.067 --> 08:22.402
*

08:22.435 --> 08:24.838
* If it's getting late

08:24.872 --> 08:27.541
*

08:27.575 --> 08:29.677
* I won't pick up the phone

08:29.710 --> 08:32.646
*

08:32.680 --> 08:37.150
* Well, you see me

08:37.184 --> 08:38.485
* Only on the need...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.053
JAMES:
What are you doing, Leo?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.856
*

08:42.890 --> 08:44.558
(speaking Spanish)

WOMAN:
* When you're feeling mean

08:50.197 --> 08:52.499
*

08:52.532 --> 08:57.537
* As a boulder
slowly gaining speed *

08:57.571 --> 08:59.607
* On down a hill

08:59.640 --> 09:02.242
*

09:02.275 --> 09:05.579
* In your path

09:05.613 --> 09:07.280
*

09:07.314 --> 09:08.849
* Nothing I could do

09:08.882 --> 09:10.984
You think I don't know
who you are, hmm?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.421
You think you took him
from me?

09:14.454 --> 09:16.757
(inhales sharply) You didn't.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.425
You didn't.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.028
*

09:21.061 --> 09:23.296
You never had him.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.564
He had you.

09:24.598 --> 09:31.605
*

09:33.173 --> 09:36.810
He left me the same way
he left you.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.278
Now it's just business.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.915
*

09:41.949 --> 09:43.751
Just like you.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.053

09:46.086 --> 09:49.256
(cell phone rings)

09:49.289 --> 09:52.125
That's my connect.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.927
Where are you going?

09:53.961 --> 09:56.730
I'm just gonna let them know
everything's all right.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.932
Uh-huh, why don't you
bring your connect in here?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.768
LEO: That's not how it works.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.270
This is my city.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.672
You want El Santo?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.339
Follow my lead.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.742
*

10:08.776 --> 10:11.411
You burn us, I'll find you.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.515
*

10:15.548 --> 10:16.850
I don't like it.

10:16.884 --> 10:17.985
We don't have a choice.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.487
She'll--she'll come through.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.858
She's crazy, but I could
always depend on her.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.995
(men yelling in Spanish)

10:28.028 --> 10:29.096
(people screaming)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.463
Shit.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.266
GUERO: Soldiers. It's a raid.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.135
Come on. This way.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.004
(soldiers yelling)

10:37.037 --> 10:39.439
(dramatic music)

10:39.472 --> 10:42.209
We're surrounded.
Follow me.

10:42.242 --> 10:48.982
*

10:49.016 --> 10:51.051
(speaking Spanish)

10:51.084 --> 10:56.123
*

10:56.156 --> 10:57.958
Let's blend in.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.459
GUERO: Leo sold us out.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.361
(soldiers yelling)

11:01.394 --> 11:03.396
MAN: (speaking Spanish)

11:03.430 --> 11:05.799
(soldier shouts)

11:05.833 --> 11:08.301
(sniffs)

11:08.335 --> 11:11.872
*

11:11.905 --> 11:15.175
A little bunny told me I could
find two machos in here...

11:16.443 --> 11:19.646
And one pretty Mexicana,

11:19.679 --> 11:23.751
looking to traffic cocaine
from my city.

11:23.784 --> 11:29.857
*

11:29.890 --> 11:33.927
You didn't happen to see
somebody like that, have you?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.695
No, we just came here
to party.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.766
(sniffs)

11:38.799 --> 11:40.734
*

11:40.768 --> 11:42.435
Mind if I sit?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.274
Seeing as you're just
here to party...

11:48.708 --> 11:49.709
(clinking)

11:49.743 --> 11:50.944
Not to do business...

11:50.978 --> 11:54.081
*

11:54.114 --> 11:55.548
Go on.

12:00.220 --> 12:07.227
*

12:14.334 --> 12:16.870
(snorts)

12:16.904 --> 12:23.676
*

12:30.517 --> 12:31.651
Again.

12:31.684 --> 12:38.691
*

12:47.500 --> 12:51.438
*

12:51.471 --> 12:54.474
(coughs)

12:54.507 --> 12:56.643
(moans)

12:56.676 --> 12:58.311
Again.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.679
*

12:59.712 --> 13:00.948
I'm good. Thank you.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.582
I've had enough.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.985
*

13:05.018 --> 13:07.454
I said, "again,"
mi fresa.

13:07.487 --> 13:14.494
*

13:15.896 --> 13:19.799
(heartbeat thudding)

13:19.833 --> 13:26.840
*

13:28.341 --> 13:32.145
(piercing eerie sounds)

13:32.179 --> 13:37.784
*

13:37.817 --> 13:40.453
You sure you're not
the Mexicana I'm looking for?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.624
(heartbeat pumping rapidly)

13:44.657 --> 13:48.395
In that case,
you came to party...

13:48.428 --> 13:51.198
*

13:51.231 --> 13:52.732
Let's party.

13:52.765 --> 13:59.739
*

14:02.709 --> 14:03.911
No, no...

14:03.944 --> 14:05.045
-Wait, wait.
-Get the--

14:08.115 --> 14:09.182
We got 100 grand.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.217
Just take it.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.186
We'll leave.
You'll never see us again.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.754
The money's under the table,
okay?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.723
Here.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.258
(breathing heavily)

14:18.291 --> 14:21.194
(indistinct murmuring)

14:21.228 --> 14:22.562
*

14:22.595 --> 14:24.064
(laughing)

14:24.097 --> 14:25.265
It's done.

14:26.967 --> 14:27.935
(soldiers shouting)

14:27.968 --> 14:29.402
(gasps)

14:30.570 --> 14:33.240
*

14:33.273 --> 14:36.243
Hey, hey, look...
(speaking indistinctly)

14:36.276 --> 14:39.346
Hey, look at me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.713
-Gotta get her out of here.
-Get her up, come on.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.515
Get her up. I got you.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.952
(groaning)

14:50.057 --> 14:51.524
We need something
to slow her heart.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.193
Bring her over here.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.563
(exciting music)

14:56.596 --> 14:58.365
JAMES:
(speaks indistinctly)

14:58.398 --> 15:00.133
Go search the crowd for
something to bring her down.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.969
It's a coke bar.
There'll be something.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.604
*

15:04.637 --> 15:06.273
We need to cool you down.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.041
-Ready?
-Yeah.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.376
Here.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.378
(gasping)

15:11.411 --> 15:13.947
There you go.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.483
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.318
-James...
-What?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.053
I'm here. I'm here.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.122
If I don't make it
out of Bolivia--

15:22.155 --> 15:24.224
You're gonna be fine. Stop it.
I'm with you, okay?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.826
You have to promise me
that you're gonna let him go.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.828
Don't kill Guero.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.098
JAMES: What'd you find?
What'd you get?

15:31.131 --> 15:32.299
I got some pills.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.766
Here, here...
(murmurs)

15:33.800 --> 15:36.003
Take these. Take these.
It's...

15:36.036 --> 15:37.804
It's Benadryl; it's gonna help
slow your heart down.

15:37.837 --> 15:41.574
-Here.
-(breathing heavily)

15:41.608 --> 15:44.944
*

15:44.978 --> 15:46.513
JAMES: We need to get her
to a hospital

15:46.546 --> 15:47.947
and then get the hell
out of Bolivia.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.149
Yeah, and what about
El Santo, huh?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.450
It's over!

15:50.483 --> 15:51.951
You're just gonna
pull the plug?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.186
You failed.
You almost killed her.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.621
There we go.
There we go. Good.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.622
That's what this
is really about. Good.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.524
Stop it! (gasping)

15:59.326 --> 16:00.994
We need to find Leo.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.462
You're in no state,

16:02.495 --> 16:05.265
and she tried to kill you,
okay?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.800
TERESA: I didn't come
all this way for nothing.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.436
I know where to find her.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.671
*

16:11.704 --> 16:14.874
(breathing heavily)

16:20.147 --> 16:22.949
(sighs)

16:22.982 --> 16:25.452
CAMILA: It was Boaz's fault.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.454
He's working with Epifanio.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.822
They screwed our shipment
in Galveston.

16:29.856 --> 16:33.026
We wouldn't be in this situation
if he hadn't betrayed me.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.196
We need to send the Jimenezes
a message.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.298
It's gonna be very difficult.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.667
Their security's gonna be
on high alert.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.203
You're close to his enforcer,
aren't you?

16:43.236 --> 16:45.705
El Puño?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.040
He trained me.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.708
I'm godfather to his daughter,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.210
back in Chihuahua.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.579
Well, then you shouldn't
have a problem

16:52.612 --> 16:53.780
getting close to him.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.749
CAMILA:
I'll handle Epifanio.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.052
You handle El Puño.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.855
What's the message?

17:05.092 --> 17:08.228
No message.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.097
Just bring me his head.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.100
(tense music)

17:13.133 --> 17:17.104
*

17:17.137 --> 17:20.340
MAN: (singing in Spanish)

17:20.373 --> 17:26.846
*

17:26.879 --> 17:30.383
(dog barking,
people speaking Spanish)

17:33.486 --> 17:36.022
Sure you don't want
to wait in the car?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.424
It's safer inside.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.759
Let's go.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.096
GUERO: It's all the way
at the top, on the left.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.932
JAMES: What makes you think
she still lives here?

17:45.965 --> 17:48.201
GUERO: She was born
in this house.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.069
Means a lot to her.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.571
She'll be here.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.073
*

17:54.107 --> 17:56.543
You sure you're all right?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.278
I'll rest at the top.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.712
Let's go.

17:59.746 --> 18:05.218
*

18:05.252 --> 18:07.754
(door bangs, lock clatters)

18:13.193 --> 18:14.627
Leo?

18:14.661 --> 18:20.667
*

18:21.868 --> 18:23.470
GUERO: Leo?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.147
GUERO: Her parents
were killed by the cartel.

18:37.784 --> 18:44.791
*

18:52.299 --> 18:55.968
GUERO: That guy takes himself
a little too seriously.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.505
You need to back off,
give him some space.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.373
He's not used to
having to compete.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.209
Is that what we're doing here?
Competing?

19:02.242 --> 19:04.010
You know what I mean.
Just be careful.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.446
They already don't trust you.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.948
*

19:08.981 --> 19:10.683
I see the way he looks at you.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.720
*

19:13.753 --> 19:15.622
He saved my life.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.457
Okay?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.125
That's it.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.496
*

19:23.530 --> 19:25.732
We hit a snag
with Guero's connect.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.900
He's gonna have to stick around
a little longer.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.303
I'm not surprised.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.038
He's not stupid.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.807
He's stalling.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.809
Do what you have to do.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.312
CAMILA: And then I want you
to take care of Guero.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.013
Just keep Teresa out of it.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.415
Agreed.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.885
GUERO: I should have
told you about Leo.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.254
*

19:47.287 --> 19:48.755
She's still in love with you.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.191
Well, that don't excuse
what she did.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.329
No, it doesn't.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.165
But she didn't do it to me.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.569
She did it to you.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.237
WOMAN: Let me go!

20:04.271 --> 20:06.506
(indistinct arguing)

20:06.539 --> 20:08.207
What? You're gonna shoot me?
(speaks Spanish)

20:08.241 --> 20:09.409
Let her go.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.244
(shouts in Spanish)

20:11.278 --> 20:13.246
(breathing heavily)

20:13.280 --> 20:15.214
-That's for trying to kill me.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:15.248 --> 20:17.083
Hey.
Cálmate.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.418
Let me go!

20:18.451 --> 20:20.687
I want to talk to her.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.455
Alone.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.196
(indistinct chatter)

20:30.229 --> 20:31.898
I understand you

20:31.931 --> 20:34.133
because I've felt that pain too.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.869
But it disappeared.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.539
I was told he was dead.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.941
I had to run for my life.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.744
I did things
I thought I never would,

20:44.777 --> 20:46.413
things I'm ashamed of.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.548
*

20:48.581 --> 20:51.484
But I was only trying
to survive, just like you.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.987
I know he hurt you.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.289
I can see that.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.258
But you don't want him dead.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.127
Otherwise, the soldiers
that you called

21:01.160 --> 21:02.762
would have done it
at the bar.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.845
If we don't make this deal
with El Santo,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.580
Guero's going to die.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.515
My boss is gonna kill him.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.083
*

21:24.116 --> 21:26.519
If you have any feelings
left for him,

21:26.553 --> 21:29.288
you have to help us.

21:29.322 --> 21:36.295
*

21:42.402 --> 21:45.171
We deserve better than him,
Teresa.

21:45.204 --> 21:52.211
*

21:58.651 --> 22:01.120
El Santo...

22:01.153 --> 22:04.824
has a guy who has to vet you
before you meet him.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.193
They call him El Dentista.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.729
(sighs)

22:09.762 --> 22:11.097
I'll make an appointment.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.202
(Spanish hip-hop music)

22:16.235 --> 22:20.707
*

22:30.016 --> 22:34.387
*

22:37.457 --> 22:44.464
*

22:52.605 --> 22:54.373
Chihuahua.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.609
*

22:59.278 --> 23:04.484
*

23:10.590 --> 23:13.493
(engines revving)

23:24.236 --> 23:27.239
(indistinct chatter)

23:29.809 --> 23:30.977
Teresa Mendoza.

23:31.010 --> 23:35.114
*

23:35.147 --> 23:36.148
Sí.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.550
(speaks Spanish)

23:37.584 --> 23:41.721
*

23:41.754 --> 23:42.922
Sure.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.228
*

23:49.261 --> 23:50.597
It's okay. I'll go.

23:52.965 --> 23:59.972
*

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
This is bullshit.

24:09.315 --> 24:15.788
*

24:18.525 --> 24:20.493
Don't be nervous.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.261
What is this?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.630
An examination.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.333
Please.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.201
It's part of his process.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.171
El Santo?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.340
Sit.

24:34.373 --> 24:41.380
*

24:42.849 --> 24:44.784
I represent Camila Vargas.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.787
She sent me to make a deal
with El Santo.

24:47.820 --> 24:54.827
*

24:56.395 --> 24:58.798
(eerie rattling noises)

24:58.831 --> 25:05.838
*

25:13.012 --> 25:13.980
This way.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.481
Open.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.483
This way.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.685
"Ah."

25:18.718 --> 25:20.352
Wide. Very wide. "Ah."

25:20.386 --> 25:26.392
*

25:27.960 --> 25:31.263
You're a long way from home.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.499
Your mercury fillings...

25:33.532 --> 25:35.835
these are only used in Mexico.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.004
I can also tell

25:38.037 --> 25:41.040
that you're not a Mexican
or an American Federale.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.276
They have
the best dental plans.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.178
I suggest
you take your friends

25:46.212 --> 25:48.715
and leave this brutal place.

25:48.748 --> 25:52.585
Tell this Camila Vargas that
your best efforts run adrift.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.722
Thank you, Doctor,
but we've come too far

25:55.755 --> 25:57.890
to turn back now.

25:57.924 --> 26:04.430
*

26:04.463 --> 26:05.965
I'm a very good dentist.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.767
Top of my class.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.269
But the majority of my time
is not spent fixing teeth...

26:11.904 --> 26:13.072
But pulling them...

26:13.973 --> 26:15.608
So that those who are
meant to be forgotten

26:15.642 --> 26:17.476
can no longer be identified.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.580
A car will pick you up
outside.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.016
Give this to the driver.

26:25.351 --> 26:28.087
God go with you, mi'ja.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.859
*

26:45.604 --> 26:47.573
JAMES:
Where's this cab gonna take us?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.575
He didn't say.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.745
You're getting in this car?

26:52.779 --> 26:55.447
TERESA: It's the only way
to El Santo.

27:01.287 --> 27:08.294
*

27:13.499 --> 27:15.034
-(laughter)
-(speaking Spanish)

27:37.890 --> 27:40.893
(soft music playing over radio)

28:08.454 --> 28:11.423
(tense music)

28:11.457 --> 28:18.464
*

28:47.960 --> 28:51.230
(dramatic melody playing)

28:51.263 --> 28:58.270
*

29:01.573 --> 29:04.410
(tense electronic music)

29:04.443 --> 29:07.279
(indistinct chatter)

29:07.313 --> 29:13.986
*

29:24.630 --> 29:31.003
*

29:46.718 --> 29:49.155
I thought I heard someone.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.256
*

29:50.289 --> 29:51.958
(door closes)

29:51.991 --> 29:53.860
*

29:53.893 --> 29:56.028
It's a test.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.630
We're being vetted, watched.

29:58.664 --> 29:59.999
I'm gonna take a look around,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.700
make sure
we're not being ambushed.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.702
-No, we should stay together.
-I won't be long.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.671
TERESA: Then we'll all go.
Come on, let's go.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.806
No, no, you need to wait here in
case El Santo's people show up.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.509
If anyone gets in trouble,
you fire three shots, okay?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.111
*

30:12.144 --> 30:13.145
Okay.

30:13.179 --> 30:20.152
*

30:24.356 --> 30:26.425
(music swells)

30:30.829 --> 30:32.698
Whoa.
Hey, look at this.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.867
What is it?

30:34.901 --> 30:36.835
It's El Santos' Bible.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.137
I've heard about this thing.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.139
He wrote it for his followers.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.009
*

30:43.042 --> 30:45.644
Let me see.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.146
Yeah, he's not just
a drug dealer;

30:47.179 --> 30:48.547
he runs some sort of
whacked-out cult.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.359
(murmurs in Spanish)

31:03.262 --> 31:04.396
(woman laughs)

31:25.651 --> 31:28.054
(giggles, speaking Spanish)

31:31.991 --> 31:32.992
(gun clicks)

31:53.345 --> 32:00.352
*

32:11.163 --> 32:13.799
(phone buzzing)

32:13.832 --> 32:16.402
*

32:16.435 --> 32:17.436
(grunts)

32:17.469 --> 32:20.006
(groaning)

32:20.039 --> 32:21.173
(gasps)

32:24.443 --> 32:26.678
MAN: ¿Jefe? Jefe?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.981
(gunshots, men grunting)

32:29.015 --> 32:30.016
(bodies thudding)

32:30.983 --> 32:31.950
(gasps)

32:46.232 --> 32:53.239
*

33:12.491 --> 33:14.460
(groans)

33:14.493 --> 33:16.828
(blade slicing)

33:22.234 --> 33:26.305
They're not planning
on me leaving Bolivia.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.140
You know that, right?

33:28.174 --> 33:30.309
Camila and James want me dead.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.178
I'm not gonna
let them kill you.

33:32.211 --> 33:36.315
*

33:36.348 --> 33:38.584
I don't know you anymore,
do I?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.521
I'm not the same girl
you left behind.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.924
Yeah, I know.

33:45.957 --> 33:46.892
(firework screeches)

33:46.925 --> 33:48.494
What's that?

33:48.527 --> 33:50.229
It's gotta be
some type of signal.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.563
(gunshots)

33:51.597 --> 33:52.764
James.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.100
Teresa, wait!

33:54.133 --> 33:55.334
Wait!

33:55.367 --> 33:57.503
(exciting music)

33:57.536 --> 33:59.037
(gunshots)

33:59.071 --> 34:00.439
-James!
-Hey, come on, go this way.

34:00.472 --> 34:03.642
(gunfire)

34:12.618 --> 34:15.154
(men shouting in Spanish)

34:25.664 --> 34:28.467
So your family still doesn't
know who killed Manuel.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.569
It's best
that stay between us.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.471
But now I'm paying
for his funeral.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.540
(speaks Spanish)

34:34.573 --> 34:36.208
But it's the least I could do.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.609
No expense spared.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.915
Rest in peace, Manuel.

34:43.949 --> 34:47.419
And long live the new king,
Boaz.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.991
(speaking Spanish)

35:03.635 --> 35:04.770
(groans)

35:24.790 --> 35:25.824
(gags softly)

35:46.345 --> 35:47.879
Hmm.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.881
So I take it you got your mask.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.116
If this is
some kind of threat...

35:51.149 --> 35:52.784
CAMILA: No.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.653
-It's a declaration.
EPIFANIO: Of war?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.655
You declared it once before,
and I'm still standing.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.857
One dead soldier...

35:58.890 --> 36:00.626
changes nothing.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.960
CAMILA: It's a declaration
of independence.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.130
And one more thing, my love.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.734
Next time you want to send me
a personal message,

36:08.767 --> 36:10.569
leave our lawyers out of it.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.238
-Listen, I--
-(phone beeps)

36:15.507 --> 36:17.343
He got the message.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.779
(Camila chuckles)

36:32.691 --> 36:35.694
-(grunts)
-(speaks Spanish)

36:44.069 --> 36:47.005
I gave you a chance
to leave,

36:47.038 --> 36:50.442
but you dug in deeper.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.943
Like ticks.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.715
So now,

36:56.748 --> 36:58.784
you require the flame.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.252
JAMES:
If it's more money you want,

37:00.286 --> 37:01.620
let me talk to my boss.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.355
We can figure something out.

37:03.389 --> 37:06.592
I don't cut deals
with traffickers, Sancho.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.193
I want one thing

37:08.226 --> 37:11.430
and one thing only.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.365
El Santo.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.800
We don't know him.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.868
-Liar.
-It's true.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.405
We came here
looking for El Santo.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.540
We failed.
We don't know him.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.809
Aw.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.344
Mi'ja.

37:27.313 --> 37:31.317
After the moment we had
back at the bar,

37:31.350 --> 37:34.085
I know you made
the connection.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.588
This marrana told me.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.224
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.592
Uh-huh?

37:45.931 --> 37:47.666
This puta here
said you don't know

37:47.699 --> 37:49.267
what you're talking about.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.737
Should I cut
your lying tongue--

37:51.770 --> 37:52.838
Leave her alone!

37:52.871 --> 37:54.406
We gave you money.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.841
We can't get you
what you're asking for.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.944
Tell me how to find El Santo.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.585
Tell me how to find El Santo.

38:06.618 --> 38:13.625
*

38:14.960 --> 38:16.161
Let Teresa go.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.663
Guero...

38:17.696 --> 38:19.998
Let her go.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.933
*

38:21.967 --> 38:23.969
-Or she'll end up--
-(gunshot)

38:24.002 --> 38:27.005
(gasps) No!

38:27.038 --> 38:28.774
(breathing heavily)

38:28.807 --> 38:30.942
What?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.979
Did you think the fire
would be pretty, Mexicana?

38:35.914 --> 38:42.721
*

38:45.391 --> 38:46.925
We don't know
how to get to El Santo.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.498
We know as much as you do!

38:52.531 --> 38:54.933
-(gasping)
-No.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.804
In exactly one minute,

38:58.837 --> 39:00.872
I want you to kill
both those men.

39:00.906 --> 39:01.907
MAN: Sí, Capitán.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.150
-My people...
-(chair scraping)

39:12.183 --> 39:15.654
Are drowning in drugs,

39:15.687 --> 39:17.389
corruption,

39:17.423 --> 39:20.826
spiritual perversion.

39:20.859 --> 39:26.164
El Santo is the water
pouring into their throats.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.467
And they only have me
to protect them.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.873
I will kill anyone...

39:34.906 --> 39:38.343
Everyone who tries
to hurt my country.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.746
It's the only home I have.

39:40.779 --> 39:45.016
*

39:45.050 --> 39:48.787
You only have a few seconds
before your men are dead.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.091
Give me El Santo.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.026
*

39:55.060 --> 39:56.294
Hmm?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.302
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

40:04.335 --> 40:05.771
Oh, well.
