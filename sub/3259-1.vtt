00:55.633 --> 00:57.633
Graduation showcase.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.590
Oh, come on.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.155
Sporting a fresh new look.

01:08.379 --> 01:10.379
Pins, pins, pins...

01:13.384 --> 01:15.384
Yes.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.791
20 seconds.

01:27.764 --> 01:28.715
Oh my God, Kate.

01:28.815 --> 01:29.616
Total disaster.

01:29.716 --> 01:31.196
She completely mangled the elastic...

01:31.284 --> 01:32.185
Not my fault.

01:32.285 --> 01:33.353
You make it so flimsy.

01:33.453 --> 01:34.888
Flimsy? It wasn't flimsy.

01:34.988 --> 01:37.490
You tore it with your stiletto.
Who puts shoes on first?

01:37.590 --> 01:38.358
Russians.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.726
Polly, breathe.

01:39.826 --> 01:41.826
Gonna pin it.

01:42.312 --> 01:44.364
10 seconds, Polly.

01:44.464 --> 01:45.331
Go, go.

01:45.431 --> 01:46.232
You're a lifesaver.

01:46.332 --> 01:48.768
Kate Kassell, 1 minute.

01:48.868 --> 01:50.583
Where are the pins you went to get?

01:50.683 --> 01:51.555
You just had them.

01:51.655 --> 01:53.540
Okay, well, I don't have one...

01:53.640 --> 01:55.575
so you're just gonna have to hold it up.

01:55.675 --> 01:57.644
I won't be able to remember that.

01:57.744 --> 01:59.579
It's in 30 seconds.

01:59.679 --> 02:02.059
I won't be able to remember.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.567
Oooh.

02:22.585 --> 02:25.672
Hi, um, I just wanted
to introduce myself.

02:25.772 --> 02:26.773
I'm Kate Kassell.

02:26.873 --> 02:28.675
I was the last designer of the showcase.

02:28.775 --> 02:30.610
I admire Prada so much.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.213
I was wondering if maybe
you had a position...

02:33.313 --> 02:34.280
Kassell?

02:34.380 --> 02:36.380
Of Kassell clothing?

02:36.633 --> 02:37.450
Yeah.

02:37.550 --> 02:38.651
Well, that's my father's business...

02:38.751 --> 02:43.256
So you're the daughter of the
man whose business is built on...

02:43.356 --> 02:46.559
taking our designs
and turning out knockoffs...

02:46.659 --> 02:48.869
and you'd like a job?

02:49.145 --> 02:50.430
Yeah.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.199
Uh, well that's actually
why I went to fashion school.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.502
Dear, you're obviously very talented...

02:55.602 --> 02:59.512
but with your pedigree
who would hire you?

03:00.423 --> 03:02.423
Nice meeting you, Kate.

03:32.823 --> 03:36.491
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

03:54.677 --> 03:57.312
Shouldn't you be in bed?

03:57.481 --> 04:01.401
I'm allowed to stay up to 10 these days.

04:01.501 --> 04:03.819
Hello, my darling Kate.

04:06.723 --> 04:08.541
You look so thin.

04:08.641 --> 04:10.553
We need to get some soup into you.

04:10.653 --> 04:11.428
Richard's here.

04:11.528 --> 04:13.528
Richard.

04:14.831 --> 04:16.649
Did you call your Dad...

04:16.749 --> 04:19.752
or is this another secret
visit to Montreal?

04:19.851 --> 04:22.572
All hail the conquering heroine.

04:22.588 --> 04:24.588
There she is.

04:26.342 --> 04:27.710
Hup.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.796
You look more like
your mother every day.

04:29.896 --> 04:32.865
Doesn't she and she
has the talent to match.

04:32.965 --> 04:36.569
My goddaughter can make a
ball gown out of a burlap sack.

04:36.669 --> 04:39.372
Oh, such fond memories of burlap.

04:39.472 --> 04:40.632
Not for mixed company though.

04:40.707 --> 04:41.641
Vino, Tinto?

04:41.741 --> 04:43.259
Yes, please.

04:43.359 --> 04:44.711
Who's that?

04:44.811 --> 04:46.329
It's Dad.

04:46.429 --> 04:47.847
He's sorry that he
missed my showcase...

04:47.947 --> 04:52.027
and he's asking if I want
to work at Kassell.

04:52.670 --> 04:57.390
Seriously and work for my
stepmom and her two devil spawn.

04:57.490 --> 04:58.391
Forget about them.

04:58.491 --> 05:00.493
You could design.
You could learn the trade.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.563
I want to work in a couture
fashion house, Bella.

05:03.663 --> 05:06.532
And I want to perform
'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'

05:06.632 --> 05:08.434
on Broadway
opposite Channing Tatum.

05:08.534 --> 05:09.602
I'd pay to see that.

05:09.702 --> 05:11.371
Honey, anyone would...

05:11.471 --> 05:15.976
but sometimes even the
best ideas don't work out.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.345
What'd you do if
you were in my shoes?

05:19.445 --> 05:20.113
Get new shoes.

05:20.213 --> 05:21.581
Amen.

05:21.681 --> 05:23.683
If I were you,
I'd take his offer.

05:23.783 --> 05:25.852
You have nothing to
lose and you never know...

05:25.952 --> 05:26.853
where this might lead.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.721
But seriously, new shoes.

05:28.821 --> 05:32.458
No one wants to see a
dentist with bad teeth.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.360
Okay.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.435
Who's pouring me some of that vino?

05:39.917 --> 05:41.734
You're going for a job in fashion...

05:41.834 --> 05:43.403
and this is what you're wearing?

05:43.503 --> 05:44.470
Oh, stop fussing.

05:44.570 --> 05:47.800
Well, at least let me add some colour.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.525
Humour me.

06:12.449 --> 06:13.266
Are you okay?

06:13.366 --> 06:14.901
Ow.

06:15.001 --> 06:15.568
You okay?

06:15.668 --> 06:19.739
Just... I'm a little bit nervous and um,

06:19.839 --> 06:21.879
it's my first day. So...

06:21.941 --> 06:23.443
It's gonna be fine.

06:23.543 --> 06:26.646
Just go slowly.

06:26.746 --> 06:30.061
All right, I'm going to try this again.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.692
Kassell Clothing.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.792
One moment please.

06:43.013 --> 06:44.063
Kassell Clothing.

06:44.163 --> 06:45.031
Hi.

06:45.131 --> 06:46.699
I'll see if he's in.

06:46.799 --> 06:48.034
I'm here...

06:48.134 --> 06:49.134
She's in a meeting.

06:49.135 --> 06:49.702
Excuse me.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.070
Can you just...

06:51.170 --> 06:53.170
With whom?

06:53.590 --> 06:55.641
Hello, girl who can't work a door. Hi.

06:55.741 --> 06:57.977
Um, I'm here to see Lee Kassell.

06:58.077 --> 07:01.814
You can speak to the
Vice-President, Elise Kassell.

07:01.914 --> 07:02.882
Fantastic.

07:02.982 --> 07:04.684
Let me be very clear.

07:04.784 --> 07:07.787
The price I will pay is
the price I was quoted.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.555
I don't care about the shortage.

07:09.655 --> 07:11.023
I didn't cause the typhoon.

07:11.123 --> 07:15.795
So what you need to do is get
me that shipment at that price.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.895
You got it?

07:19.749 --> 07:23.970
Fine, thank you so much.

07:24.070 --> 07:27.155
Yes, okay, thank you, bye-bye.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.777
Katie.

07:30.877 --> 07:31.611
Oh my goodness.

07:31.711 --> 07:32.845
Is that really you?

07:32.945 --> 07:34.781
It's been so long. Look at you.

07:34.881 --> 07:37.683
What a cute hat.
That's so brave.

07:37.783 --> 07:38.985
It's good to see you, Elise.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.586
What are you going here?

07:40.686 --> 07:42.855
Well, uh, I was going to see my dad.

07:42.955 --> 07:45.425
Oh, your dad's in London for the week.

07:45.525 --> 07:46.225
Yeah...

07:46.325 --> 07:47.493
It doesn't matter.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.595
Y'know your stepmom is
here for anything you need.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.097
Just ask away.

07:51.197 --> 07:54.867
I'd like to take him up
on his offer of a job.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.967
Wow.

07:57.086 --> 07:58.070
That's great.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.740
I... you know what I
think I'm just surprised...

08:00.840 --> 08:02.642
because there was that,
you know,

08:02.742 --> 08:05.878
difficult separation
before you went to New York.

08:05.978 --> 08:08.915
Yeah, um, here's my portfolio.

08:09.015 --> 08:12.755
It's just... it's some
mock ups and sketches.

08:12.785 --> 08:15.021
I thought you wanted
to work in couture?

08:15.121 --> 08:16.756
I'd love to work here.

08:16.856 --> 08:19.091
I grew up here and
it's the family business.

08:19.191 --> 08:23.866
The business has changed so
much since you were young...

08:24.080 --> 08:26.165
and so has the family.

08:26.265 --> 08:30.085
Oh Katie, we are
thrilled to have you back.

08:30.787 --> 08:32.038
There's just a long queue.

08:32.138 --> 08:33.773
Everyone wants to design.

08:33.873 --> 08:35.640
Well, I don't want
any special treatment.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.710
Really, you would
just work your way up...

08:37.809 --> 08:39.712
and pay your dues just
like everyone else?

08:39.812 --> 08:40.580
Of course.

08:40.679 --> 08:45.651
That... that's just such a great attitude.

08:45.751 --> 08:50.056
You know what, I'm going to put
you under Tannis and Simone...

08:50.156 --> 08:53.641
and just keep it all in the family.

08:53.943 --> 08:56.562
Your daughters are designing?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.064
You'll see them in the meeting.

08:58.164 --> 08:59.665
What meeting?

08:59.765 --> 09:04.052
Everyone, this is Katie.

09:05.054 --> 09:06.806
Go take that seat, dear.

09:06.906 --> 09:09.609
She is fresh out of design school...

09:09.709 --> 09:12.979
and here for some real
world experience.

09:13.079 --> 09:16.394
I see everyone has a water and I don't.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.073
I guess I'm not thirsty.

09:22.872 --> 09:24.674
You okay?

09:24.774 --> 09:26.275
Yeah.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.093
It's really...

09:27.193 --> 09:27.960
It's okay. It's-it's...

09:28.060 --> 09:30.270
I'll take care of it.

09:31.147 --> 09:33.187
I'm sure no one noticed.

09:33.916 --> 09:34.934
So sorry.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.068
Don't worry.

09:36.168 --> 09:38.037
Nobody here thinks
you're awkward or anything.

09:38.137 --> 09:39.839
Oh my God; No one.

09:39.939 --> 09:41.941
We're all just
embarrassed for you right now.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.043
Maurice, where's our model.

09:44.143 --> 09:45.811
The twins fired her on Wednesday.

09:45.911 --> 09:47.246
We're not twins.

09:47.346 --> 09:48.948
Stop saying that.

09:49.048 --> 09:52.788
Well, who's going to
try on the dress for us?

09:54.270 --> 09:55.988
How about Kate?

09:56.088 --> 09:57.773
Me?

09:57.873 --> 09:58.991
I'm not really a model.

09:59.091 --> 10:00.726
Absolutely it should be you, Kate.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.762
Yeah, we need to
support her right now.

10:02.862 --> 10:05.698
Yeah, she just had that humiliating fall.

10:05.798 --> 10:06.666
We all saw it.

10:06.766 --> 10:07.867
Excellent idea.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.235
Come on, Katie.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.335
Okay.

10:18.195 --> 10:19.979
Um, excuse me.

10:20.079 --> 10:22.544
There's a screen right there.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.157
How hard is it to change into something.

10:31.257 --> 10:33.259
Yeah. How hard?

10:33.359 --> 10:36.028
We have a good variety of fabric.

10:36.128 --> 10:39.298
Where is it written that every
piece must come in five colours?

10:39.398 --> 10:42.068
On the requisition orders you signed.

10:42.168 --> 10:46.205
No, I only sign those
things for the pieces I like.

10:46.305 --> 10:48.007
But you signed them.

10:48.107 --> 10:51.043
Well, I like it better already.

10:51.143 --> 10:54.313
Okay, as instructed by
the powers that be,

10:54.413 --> 10:56.148
I stripped down the design.

10:56.248 --> 10:59.752
That's what happens when
you take away the fun.

10:59.852 --> 11:02.321
We're not focusing on fun, Maurice.

11:02.421 --> 11:05.257
Our customers are
worker bees who shop...

11:05.357 --> 11:06.659
during their lunch hour.

11:06.759 --> 11:10.696
Girls, I'd like you to come up
with something better so go back...

11:10.796 --> 11:14.000
to the inspiration board
and for everyone else,

11:14.100 --> 11:16.100
we're done. Bye-bye.

11:17.319 --> 11:20.940
I want the two of
you to supervise Kate.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.876
I thought she was too good for retail.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.077
She is.

11:25.177 --> 11:28.067
I don't think she'll like it here.

11:30.199 --> 11:31.867
Why not?

11:31.967 --> 11:33.319
Why wouldn't she like it?

11:33.419 --> 11:35.221
There's free coffee and donuts...

11:35.321 --> 11:40.292
Tannis, she's saying she
wants us to get Kate to quit.

11:40.392 --> 11:42.410
Oh, yeah.

11:44.013 --> 11:44.513
Um...

11:44.597 --> 11:48.734
I'm-I'm Daniel by the way; From Shoes.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.435
Hi.

11:49.535 --> 11:50.269
Hi.

11:50.369 --> 11:51.971
Is it always like this?

11:52.071 --> 11:54.340
Oh no, normally it's really tense.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.325
Kate?

11:56.425 --> 11:58.077
Forget him, honey.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.380
He's been single so long
I think he's forgotten how.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.480
Kate. Now.

12:04.034 --> 12:05.317
I left my stuff back there.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.987
Do you guys think I
could change out of this?

12:08.087 --> 12:08.587
Why?

12:08.621 --> 12:12.391
Way better than what wearing before.

12:12.491 --> 12:16.177
And this room hasn't
been sorted in years.

12:23.252 --> 12:25.252
Okay.

12:26.088 --> 12:28.140
How do you want it?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.892
Uh... sorted.

13:25.381 --> 13:27.381
Yes.

13:30.387 --> 13:33.087
That will do.

13:38.961 --> 13:43.082
Be nice cause she's
nice and you're not.

13:43.182 --> 13:44.383
Hey.

13:44.483 --> 13:48.888
Um, I have some ideas for this dress.

13:48.988 --> 13:50.268
It's very nice already, Maurice.

13:50.322 --> 13:52.391
Please, I hate it.

13:52.491 --> 13:55.381
Elise noted it to death at sample.

13:56.146 --> 13:57.129
Um, okay,

13:57.229 --> 13:59.465
well, there's-there's
two darts at the back.

13:59.565 --> 14:02.368
Um, if you left out a
panel the waistline is...

14:02.468 --> 14:05.004
Oh, I love this.

14:05.104 --> 14:05.971
Very Twiggy.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.206
Yes, 60s, right?

14:07.306 --> 14:08.627
And with these buttons I found...

14:08.641 --> 14:11.276
we've got thousands of them.

14:15.297 --> 14:19.084
Kate, if I wanted you to have
an idea I'd give it to you.

14:19.184 --> 14:21.253
Yeah, where'd you
think I get all of mine?

14:21.353 --> 14:26.074
So, is the accessory room all done yet?

14:27.042 --> 14:29.528
Uh, no, nope.

14:29.628 --> 14:32.932
I should... well, I
just, I should get on that.

14:33.032 --> 14:35.032
Yeah.

14:35.551 --> 14:41.022
That was not nice.

14:43.626 --> 14:44.944
Tannis?

14:45.044 --> 14:45.611
What?

14:45.711 --> 14:47.046
Get in here.

14:47.146 --> 14:48.380
Okay.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.551
Kate, you're seriously
wearing those overalls to work?

14:52.651 --> 14:54.553
Is it bring your shame to work day?

14:54.653 --> 14:57.089
I'm sorting buttons and
I needed the pockets.

14:57.189 --> 15:00.059
Sorting buttons when you should
be designing and they know it.

15:00.159 --> 15:01.093
Right now I'm just paying my dues.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.927
And I don't wanna give Elise
a reason to tell him...

15:04.027 --> 15:05.415
that I'm not working out.

15:05.515 --> 15:07.199
Just remember to push
for what you want.

15:07.299 --> 15:10.018
All I want right now is a cab.

15:12.088 --> 15:14.088
Yes.

15:16.525 --> 15:19.245
Um, Elise needs to speak to you.

15:19.311 --> 15:21.521
And she's the boss of you.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.610
I understand but I'm
gonna show them this...

15:25.710 --> 15:26.536
in the meeting.

15:26.636 --> 15:28.404
Hey, Dad.

15:28.504 --> 15:30.504
Kate.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.942
Kate.

15:33.042 --> 15:33.859
Hi.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.959
Hi.

15:36.712 --> 15:37.463
Look at you.

15:37.563 --> 15:41.367
I'm, um, Elise told me
that you accepted my offer.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.467
I'm so pleased.

15:44.420 --> 15:49.275
Uh, well, you've,
uh, um, you're taller.

15:49.375 --> 15:52.060
Ah, I'm exactly the same size.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.014
I mean, well you know,

15:55.114 --> 15:56.248
I mean, you've grown up.

15:56.348 --> 15:57.383
Yeah.

15:57.483 --> 15:59.135
Four years, you know.

15:59.235 --> 16:02.380
No, it hasn't been that long, has it?

16:04.707 --> 16:06.475
Okay.

16:06.575 --> 16:11.030
Um, I'm very sorry that I
missed your graduation.

16:11.130 --> 16:11.964
No...

16:12.064 --> 16:14.166
No, it was-it was rescheduling the...

16:14.266 --> 16:15.106
Yeah. No, Dad.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.568
I'm sure that you were just really,

16:16.668 --> 16:18.070
really busy here and...

16:18.170 --> 16:20.072
He's a very busy man.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.408
Ah, here I am apologizing again.

16:22.508 --> 16:24.343
No, Dad, I'm sorry.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.443
I...

16:27.129 --> 16:28.280
We need to reconnect.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.415
Dinner, Friday.

16:29.515 --> 16:30.582
You pick it.

16:30.682 --> 16:32.167
My treat.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.118
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:33.218 --> 16:34.586
Yeah, let's do it.

16:34.686 --> 16:35.521
Great.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.621
Yeah.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.486
Good talk.

17:38.801 --> 17:40.801
Hello?

18:02.291 --> 18:03.142
Are they alright?

18:03.242 --> 18:04.593
Oh.

18:04.693 --> 18:06.211
I'm so sorry.

18:06.311 --> 18:06.945
It's okay.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.647
Ow.

18:08.747 --> 18:11.150
You gotta start wearing a helmet...

18:11.250 --> 18:13.250
I'm sorry.

18:13.368 --> 18:15.287
They're really nice,
these shoes.

18:15.387 --> 18:15.988
Thanks.

18:16.088 --> 18:17.289
Wanna try them on?

18:17.389 --> 18:18.624
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.633
Come on. I've never seen...

18:19.733 --> 18:20.573
them with someone.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.227
I have to get back to work anyway...

18:22.327 --> 18:24.327
This is work.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
Okay.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.535
I'll do it.

18:29.635 --> 18:31.635
Safer that way.

18:38.227 --> 18:39.812
I'm an odd size.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.414
Yeah, they're a bit big.

18:42.514 --> 18:44.233
They're nice.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.384
Nice?

18:45.484 --> 18:46.518
Oh, you're a designer.

18:46.618 --> 18:48.998
You can do better than that.

18:49.771 --> 18:50.722
Okay.

18:50.822 --> 18:54.809
Um... the pitch needs work...

18:55.744 --> 19:00.299
and the width of the
last is a bit narrow.

19:00.399 --> 19:03.235
I would actually close the
peep and lower the vamps,

19:03.335 --> 19:07.670
and then you could just-
just get rid of the straps.

19:08.657 --> 19:10.409
I don't know.

19:10.509 --> 19:13.445
I was expecting maybe
like one adjective but...

19:13.545 --> 19:14.446
I asked.

19:14.546 --> 19:15.647
I'm sorry, I didn't...

19:15.747 --> 19:20.768
I-I asked for it and
actually you're right.

19:22.671 --> 19:24.671
Yeah, you're right.

19:25.507 --> 19:26.692
Well, buttons await.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.578
If I can find my way back there.

19:31.381 --> 19:35.567
Do, uh, can I walk you there?

19:35.667 --> 19:36.602
Oh, yeah.

19:36.702 --> 19:38.253
Sure.

19:38.353 --> 19:40.353
Okay.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.557
Um, kids? Married?

19:46.528 --> 19:48.528
I'm quite unattached.

19:50.399 --> 19:52.399
Same for me.

19:52.868 --> 19:54.353
Yeah, Maurice was telling me...

19:54.453 --> 19:56.453
Ah, Maurice.

19:56.805 --> 20:00.659
I like the guy but sometimes...

20:00.759 --> 20:02.161
what did he say?

20:02.261 --> 20:05.764
I'm a broken man hiding in
the basement licking my wounds.

20:05.864 --> 20:07.864
Cursing my fate.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.618
That you were single.

20:11.888 --> 20:13.888
Oh.

20:15.357 --> 20:17.876
So terrible,
all these people laid off?

20:17.976 --> 20:21.780
Yeah well, back when Mr.
Kassell actually gave a damn,

20:21.880 --> 20:24.550
this used to be a great place to work.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.785
Now he's like some mythical beast.

20:26.885 --> 20:30.455
You know there's been sightings
but no one knows much about him.

20:30.555 --> 20:31.657
Including me.

20:31.757 --> 20:33.797
Well, you just got here.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.670
You do know that he's my dad, right?

20:38.847 --> 20:40.847
No, really.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.416
What? Oh.

20:47.689 --> 20:50.676
Just going over everything I
said in the past ten minutes...

20:50.776 --> 20:54.780
Oh, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.450
I thought you knew. I thought
everybody would know that.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.885
No don't-don't be sorry.

20:59.985 --> 21:03.622
Um, I'm the one that
was bad mouthing him.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.697
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

21:06.908 --> 21:07.726
Really?

21:07.826 --> 21:08.727
Yeah.

21:08.827 --> 21:09.695
Whoo.

21:09.795 --> 21:11.795
Ow.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.481
Huh.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.702
Looks like we're neighbours.

21:16.802 --> 21:18.403
Yeah.

21:18.503 --> 21:21.440
I might have taken you the long way.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.392
Hmm.

21:23.492 --> 21:24.910
It's a beautiful room.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.010
Very cozy.

21:27.396 --> 21:28.513
That yours?

21:28.613 --> 21:29.881
Yeah.

21:29.981 --> 21:31.583
They... it's-it's really nothing.

21:31.683 --> 21:35.083
They're just really loose, uh, sketches.

21:41.010 --> 21:43.010
Is that me?

21:43.645 --> 21:45.645
No.

21:45.647 --> 21:46.832
That's me.

21:46.932 --> 21:50.247
It was... I... it was another designer.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.454
The coat is awesome.

21:55.457 --> 21:56.475
It's a really nice coat.

21:56.575 --> 21:58.393
Thanks.

21:58.493 --> 22:01.468
It's yours if I ever get to design.

22:02.664 --> 22:04.664
Well, thank you.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.251
Um...

22:06.351 --> 22:07.085
Thanks.

22:07.185 --> 22:08.420
There you go.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.621
Have fun.

22:09.721 --> 22:11.573
I'll let you work.

22:11.673 --> 22:13.859
Try not to hurt anyone.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.959
Yup.

22:16.278 --> 22:17.129
Bye.

22:17.229 --> 22:19.229
Bye.

22:24.619 --> 22:26.619
Okay...

22:48.744 --> 22:51.596
I don't know why she hasn't quit yet.

22:51.696 --> 22:53.832
I dunno. I think buttons are kinda cool.

22:53.932 --> 22:55.932
Shh.

22:57.119 --> 22:59.119
If she won't quit.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.724
We'll just have to get Lee to fire her.

23:02.824 --> 23:04.824
Yeah.

23:06.962 --> 23:11.616
Hey, I just finished,
uh, metals versus plastics.

23:11.716 --> 23:13.716
Follow me.

23:15.971 --> 23:17.823
I was just telling the girls...

23:17.923 --> 23:21.526
this is a waste of Katie's talent.

23:21.626 --> 23:24.601
It's time we moved you into design.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.699
Thank you, Elise.

23:27.799 --> 23:29.568
I promise I won't let you down.

23:29.668 --> 23:31.668
I have so many ideas.

23:31.753 --> 23:35.153
Just remember,
you're the CEO's daughter.

23:35.173 --> 23:36.942
So always be a team player.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.042
Absolutely.

23:41.998 --> 23:45.851
Everyone, Katie Kassell.

23:45.951 --> 23:49.821
Yes, that Kassell but
no special treatment.

23:49.921 --> 23:50.956
That's your place.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.657
Girls?

23:52.757 --> 23:54.526
Well, that was a quick promotion.

23:54.626 --> 23:56.094
Yes, well, she's here to help.

23:56.194 --> 23:57.462
Aren't you Katie?

23:57.562 --> 24:00.799
Dad, I found the most amazing
restaurant for dinner tonight.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.701
No student dives.
This is my treat.

24:02.801 --> 24:06.037
We have dinner with the mayor
tonight about that tax thing.

24:06.137 --> 24:07.606
Took us forever to get.

24:07.706 --> 24:08.306
Right.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.775
Tomorrow then.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.110
Tomorrow, you're in Laval.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.686
Why don't you let me arrange it?

24:13.786 --> 24:14.697
I know his schedule.

24:14.797 --> 24:15.981
Let Elise arrange this.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.999
She, uh, arranges things.

24:22.604 --> 24:24.604
Okay, girls.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.895
Daddy Lee, are you
ready for our pitch?

24:29.995 --> 24:33.098
So you know how we hate to
see clothes go to waste?

24:33.198 --> 24:35.767
No, I didn't know that.

24:35.867 --> 24:36.668
Exactly.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.937
So, um, when
Maurice's designs flopped...

24:39.037 --> 24:41.173
we wanted to find a frugal solution.

24:41.273 --> 24:44.676
Yes, one that didn't cost a lot of money...

24:44.776 --> 24:46.978
and so we came up with this.

24:47.078 --> 24:48.563
Show him.

24:48.663 --> 24:49.998
Buttons.

24:50.098 --> 24:52.098
Buttons.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.037
Well, well, well.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.940
I like it.

25:01.610 --> 25:04.729
Now a simple design
with a bold concept.

25:04.829 --> 25:05.997
Exactly.

25:06.097 --> 25:08.987
In my day,
we called that a runner.

25:12.153 --> 25:14.153
Who knew?

25:23.231 --> 25:25.799
Um, guys?

25:27.269 --> 25:31.205
That was...
I came up with that.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.627
There's no I in Kassell, Kate.

25:35.727 --> 25:37.727
Except at the end.

25:37.946 --> 25:38.830
What?

25:38.930 --> 25:39.798
After the 'e'.

25:39.898 --> 25:43.635
Duh, but you write them like
'I's' Simone. Google it.

25:43.735 --> 25:45.735
It's called grammar.

25:46.756 --> 25:52.711
We pride ourselves on being
a holistic creative team.

25:52.811 --> 25:55.947
So why don't you start by
just putting our designs...

25:56.047 --> 25:57.148
into the computer.

25:57.248 --> 26:00.051
Can I just go get my
stuff in Accessories?

26:00.151 --> 26:02.621
Oh, yeah, no.
I'll get that for you.

26:02.721 --> 26:04.689
It's kind of like an inputting emergency.

26:04.789 --> 26:06.789
So...

26:06.808 --> 26:08.808
Okay. Bye.

26:16.252 --> 26:18.252
Nice buttons...

26:19.087 --> 26:23.808
Oh, we should totally upload
dirty pictures to her Instagram.

26:23.908 --> 26:26.229
Mom told me exactly what to do.

26:26.329 --> 26:27.697
Don't mess this up.

26:27.797 --> 26:28.947
I won't mess this up.

26:29.047 --> 26:31.082
Mom told me exactly what to do.

26:31.182 --> 26:33.182
I wrote it down.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.260
You need to take these to...

26:39.301 --> 26:40.061
the flagship store.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.760
But before she does that...

26:41.860 --> 26:44.696
you need to upload the
designs to the company FTP.

26:44.796 --> 26:46.798
Take these to the flagship store.

26:46.898 --> 26:50.168
Before that,
upload the designs.

26:50.268 --> 26:52.903
Have you ever done that before?

26:53.955 --> 26:57.015
Get a pen.
I'll give you the address.

27:19.914 --> 27:22.033
No, 'I' in Kassell.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.802
Are these the new pieces?

27:23.902 --> 27:24.769
Yeah.

27:24.869 --> 27:26.869
Um...

27:26.922 --> 27:29.475
I think what they're going for...

27:29.575 --> 27:30.993
you don't like them.

27:31.093 --> 27:32.777
Yeah.

27:32.877 --> 27:34.877
Um, not so much.

27:34.996 --> 27:36.948
Hold on.
Just need you to sign something.

27:37.048 --> 27:38.700
Okay.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.800
What do you think?

27:40.935 --> 27:42.220
I don't like it.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.615
Sweetie, you look beautiful.

27:45.273 --> 27:47.826
It doesn't make me feel special.

27:47.926 --> 27:48.727
Come on.

27:48.827 --> 27:49.561
You look gorgeous.

27:49.661 --> 27:52.296
No, I want that one over there.

27:52.447 --> 27:54.866
Honey, we talked about it.
Remember, it's too expensive.

27:54.966 --> 27:56.067
Please.

27:56.167 --> 27:57.002
C'mon.

27:57.102 --> 27:58.937
We can make this one work, right?

27:59.037 --> 27:59.971
I guess.

28:00.071 --> 28:01.239
You'll look beautiful.

28:01.339 --> 28:02.307
I promise.

28:02.407 --> 28:03.808
Whatever.

28:03.908 --> 28:05.029
You should've seen her face.

28:05.076 --> 28:07.116
She was so disappointed.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.948
It was such an easy
construction though...

28:10.048 --> 28:11.883
and then she had to settle for a dress.

28:11.983 --> 28:16.988
A boring, rigid,
Elise inspired dress.

28:17.088 --> 28:19.157
I don't get it.
What happened here?

28:19.257 --> 28:22.027
Well, Elise wanted to focus on bridge,

28:22.127 --> 28:23.328
day-to-night wear.

28:23.428 --> 28:24.829
You know business casual.

28:24.929 --> 28:26.929
Yeah, business boring.

28:27.949 --> 28:29.034
I don't get it.

28:29.134 --> 28:31.036
Why aren't we
using the cutting room?

28:31.136 --> 28:32.971
I mean, I could've made that dress...

28:33.071 --> 28:34.906
and it could've been affordable.

28:35.006 --> 28:39.001
It would've been so
easy for me to transform it.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.427
You know what?

28:42.063 --> 28:44.063
What?

28:44.966 --> 28:48.035
You're going to do great things.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.058
I'm sorry.

28:53.158 --> 28:55.010
There you are.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.394
Come with me, Kate.

28:56.494 --> 28:57.462
Now.

28:57.562 --> 28:58.296
Okay.

28:58.396 --> 29:00.396
No problem.

29:05.386 --> 29:07.386
Hey, Dad.

29:08.323 --> 29:10.323
Something wrong?

29:14.896 --> 29:19.084
Katie, did you upload the dress designs...

29:19.184 --> 29:21.319
to the Kassell FTP server?

29:21.419 --> 29:23.419
Yes.

29:24.439 --> 29:25.924
Did they not go through?

29:26.024 --> 29:27.192
They did.

29:27.292 --> 29:32.063
To a public FTP server
that anyone can access.

29:32.163 --> 29:35.308
And 10 minutes later,
Frost Apparel...

29:35.333 --> 29:37.951
downloaded those designs.

29:39.020 --> 29:41.106
How would they know
that they were there?

29:41.206 --> 29:42.107
I don't know.

29:42.207 --> 29:43.447
I mean, what are you saying...?

29:43.541 --> 29:46.044
Someone would have
to tell them wouldn't they?

29:46.144 --> 29:47.979
I guess.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.374
Simone gave me the address.

29:52.367 --> 29:54.085
Is this your writing?

29:54.185 --> 29:56.650
She dictated it to me, Elise.

29:58.306 --> 30:02.527
Tannis told me that you were upset.

30:02.627 --> 30:05.330
That you felt that you
contributed to their collection.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.895
I did and they took my ideas.

30:12.587 --> 30:15.106
I would never do something like this.

30:15.206 --> 30:17.206
May I see your phone?

30:29.037 --> 30:31.037
Oh.

30:31.472 --> 30:32.390
Our samples.

30:32.490 --> 30:36.461
Let's hope they have
gone nowhere else.

30:36.561 --> 30:38.263
I didn't take those.

30:38.363 --> 30:39.531
But they're in your phone.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.500
Clearly, I've been set up by somebody.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Who would set you up?

30:49.591 --> 30:54.946
I cannot have this kind of
behaviour in the workplace.

30:55.046 --> 30:57.046
Do you understand me?

30:57.632 --> 31:00.067
I cannot tolerate this.

31:01.302 --> 31:03.302
I'm sorry.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.242
Oh, Katie.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.429
You have to stop hurting your father.

31:11.529 --> 31:13.824
You've gotta be kidding me.

31:14.015 --> 31:17.569
Now obviously this is
not going to work out.

31:17.669 --> 31:18.403
Clearly.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.305
You need to clean out your desk...

31:20.405 --> 31:24.910
and I will have HR arrange
two weeks of severance.

31:26.328 --> 31:29.196
Can I have my phone back please?

31:41.443 --> 31:44.128
She totally played me
and I walked right into it...

31:44.228 --> 31:47.031
and now I can't even work at
my own family business?

31:47.131 --> 31:48.366
How could Lee be so blind?

31:48.466 --> 31:50.368
She's driving the company into the ground.

31:50.468 --> 31:54.138
She's stifling the designers
like some evil corporate witch.

31:54.238 --> 31:55.173
No offense to witches.

31:55.273 --> 31:58.758
I have gotta show him
who Elise really is.

32:00.061 --> 32:01.512
We have to do something.

32:01.612 --> 32:02.380
That's it.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.248
Let's do something.

32:03.348 --> 32:04.115
That's the spirit.

32:04.215 --> 32:06.215
Let's egg their house.

32:06.367 --> 32:07.518
What are you, twelve?

32:07.618 --> 32:10.822
You know, shame on your father.

32:10.922 --> 32:13.920
Why didn't you tell Lee
that Tannis and Simone...

32:14.020 --> 32:15.177
stole your designs...

32:15.277 --> 32:16.277
in the first place?

32:16.327 --> 32:19.197
I tried but Elise.

32:19.297 --> 32:21.366
I don't know why I'm so scared of her.

32:21.466 --> 32:25.203
I open my mouth and
nothing comes out of it.

32:25.303 --> 32:27.538
I know exactly what
you mean, buttercup.

32:27.638 --> 32:28.598
I have the same problem.

32:28.639 --> 32:31.242
You do not have the same problem.

32:31.342 --> 32:34.145
He just says what he thinks
and then regrets it later.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.580
You need some of Richard's chutzpah.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.447
Yeah.

32:36.547 --> 32:39.550
Richard you stand
there and people listen to you.

32:39.650 --> 32:42.153
You know, they make space for you.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.221
Come.

32:43.321 --> 32:45.423
Let's have them listen to us.

32:45.523 --> 32:49.348
We'll tell them, 'Make
your own damn designs.'

32:49.644 --> 32:51.939
Make your own damn designs.

32:52.348 --> 32:53.698
Make your own damn designs.

32:53.798 --> 32:56.134
Or I'll kick your ass.

32:56.234 --> 32:58.403
Your surgery enhanced asses.

32:58.503 --> 32:59.437
Yes.

32:59.537 --> 33:02.767
All the way back to the tanning salon.

33:03.659 --> 33:05.093
Kate.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.277
Richard.

33:06.377 --> 33:10.648
What-what if Richard
applied to Kassell to design?

33:10.748 --> 33:13.651
See this is when
Bella's had too much wine.

33:13.751 --> 33:16.187
And the mind.
It's the first thing to go.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.588
I don't mean you as you.

33:17.688 --> 33:20.458
I mean you as him.

33:20.558 --> 33:22.593
We could get some
clothes from the shop.

33:22.693 --> 33:24.629
Think Twelfth Night in disguise.

33:24.729 --> 33:27.465
Good Madonna, please give me
leave to prove you're a fool.

33:27.565 --> 33:28.666
Why? To do what?

33:28.766 --> 33:31.202
You need to get back into Kassell.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.137
You need to get close
to your dad again.

33:33.237 --> 33:35.447
You can't do that as Kate.

33:36.357 --> 33:37.742
Where's that picture?

33:37.842 --> 33:38.643
There.

33:38.743 --> 33:40.378
The little boy model didn't show up...

33:40.478 --> 33:41.799
and your mother used you instead.

33:41.846 --> 33:43.614
Oh, is that you?

33:43.714 --> 33:45.383
That's her.

33:45.483 --> 33:47.285
She said it's all in the attitude.

33:47.385 --> 33:50.171
See, he didn't even recognize you.

33:50.271 --> 33:52.271
Wow.

33:56.611 --> 33:58.496
Oh, no, no, no, no.

33:58.596 --> 33:59.630
I know that look.

33:59.730 --> 34:00.465
No way.

34:00.565 --> 34:03.234
You need to go back to Kassell...

34:03.334 --> 34:08.264
as someone that they will
listen to and take seriously.

34:18.533 --> 34:20.752
I'm a man. Here I am.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.387
Yes.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.487
No. No, no. No, no.

34:25.507 --> 34:27.725
If you walk like this,
people are gonna think...

34:27.824 --> 34:29.393
I have my hands here... look.

34:29.494 --> 34:31.129
See? Look at this. Look.

34:31.228 --> 34:37.467
No, I haven't done this since we
mounted 'Cyrano' at the Centaur.

34:37.568 --> 34:39.637
We also did a little play.
Can't remember the title.

34:39.737 --> 34:41.505
Just turn your chin.

34:41.606 --> 34:43.775
Last night,
this was really funny...

34:43.875 --> 34:45.275
but I just... I don't...

34:45.376 --> 34:47.376
Don't talk.

34:47.462 --> 34:50.614
You know the sideburns and the
eyebrows could be better...

34:50.715 --> 34:55.335
but the jaw; That's the real
giveaway and that is...

34:56.536 --> 34:57.537
let's go show Bella.

34:57.588 --> 35:00.425
It's Nate Ganymede.

35:00.525 --> 35:02.260
Sergio, you will not regret this.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.263
You haven't seen a designer
this good in a very long time.

35:05.363 --> 35:07.363
Trust me.

35:07.782 --> 35:09.350
Okay.

35:09.450 --> 35:11.450
Ciao, bello.

35:12.253 --> 35:14.253
Oh, yes.

35:14.288 --> 35:16.441
Hello, may I help you.

35:16.541 --> 35:20.111
Jaw line's a real giveaway
don't you think?

35:20.762 --> 35:22.263
Ah, Kate.

35:22.363 --> 35:23.214
Fooled you.

35:23.314 --> 35:27.300
Oh geez, Richard.
Are those contacts?

35:31.472 --> 35:34.617
Are you ready to go for a test drive?

35:35.643 --> 35:36.761
No way. No way.

35:36.861 --> 35:38.861
No, no.

35:38.913 --> 35:43.734
Just remember... remember do the
opposite of what Kate would do.

35:43.834 --> 35:45.303
Just be me.

35:45.403 --> 35:46.737
Be me.

35:46.837 --> 35:48.837
Wait, no...

35:56.598 --> 35:59.318
Help you with something, pal?

35:59.667 --> 36:01.667
I mean, bro?

36:02.670 --> 36:04.670
I mean, fella?

36:04.805 --> 36:05.456
Yeah.

36:05.556 --> 36:07.325
I-I need a tie for a date.

36:07.425 --> 36:08.593
I just can't decide.

36:08.693 --> 36:10.512
Um.

36:10.612 --> 36:13.680
You know, they both are pretty.

36:14.916 --> 36:18.503
You know, uh, I mean,
pretty badass.

36:18.603 --> 36:19.637
That's terrible.

36:19.737 --> 36:21.737
Be me.

36:22.590 --> 36:25.659
Um, you know, on second thought.

36:26.694 --> 36:29.244
Don't be so boring, buttercup.

36:29.697 --> 36:32.517
This-this is absolutely the, um,

36:32.617 --> 36:34.657
tie for you, right here.

36:37.772 --> 36:39.772
Oh, lovely.

36:40.508 --> 36:42.293
Uh, I don't know.

36:42.393 --> 36:45.296
Of course, it shows
that you're comfortable...

36:45.396 --> 36:46.477
with your masculinity.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.530
We like that.

36:48.849 --> 36:51.302
I mean, women like that.

36:51.402 --> 36:53.402
Heterosexual women.

36:53.588 --> 36:55.588
Or so I've heard.

36:56.724 --> 36:58.809
Oh, bravo.

36:58.909 --> 37:00.909
Bravo.

37:01.363 --> 37:04.882
And you sold the tie
twice what I would've asked for.

37:04.982 --> 37:06.417
D'you think he could tell?

37:06.517 --> 37:07.552
Not a chance.

37:07.652 --> 37:10.321
He was utterly
convinced you were a man.

37:10.421 --> 37:11.589
A weird awkward man.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.558
Well, I am imitating you, Richard.

37:13.658 --> 37:15.658
Opa.

37:17.678 --> 37:18.980
Go.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.767
Okay, so, um, I called in a favour...

37:22.867 --> 37:24.669
with the head of
recruitment at Kassell.

37:24.769 --> 37:29.473
I told him that I had a
lead on a fabulously talented,

37:29.573 --> 37:31.909
new designer named Nate.

37:32.009 --> 37:33.594
Who's Nate?

37:33.694 --> 37:34.712
You are.

37:34.812 --> 37:36.547
It's what your mom would've called you...

37:36.647 --> 37:38.482
if you had been a boy.

37:38.582 --> 37:42.420
And sweetheart, you have an
interview with Lee in 2 hours.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.087
What?

37:43.187 --> 37:43.955
You can do it.

37:44.055 --> 37:44.889
No. I can't do this.

37:44.989 --> 37:45.856
Yes, you can.

37:45.956 --> 37:46.991
You just did it.

37:47.091 --> 37:48.659
Don't-don't be scared.

37:48.759 --> 37:50.561
- Don't... breathe.
- Kate is scared.

37:50.661 --> 37:51.929
Nate is not scared.

37:52.029 --> 37:54.599
He is fearless.

37:54.699 --> 37:55.766
Nate is fierce.

37:55.866 --> 37:57.552
Fearless.

37:57.652 --> 37:59.652
Nate is fearless.

37:59.654 --> 38:00.938
You can do it.

38:01.038 --> 38:02.940
You guys know that I'm Nate, right?

38:03.040 --> 38:05.476
Hi, I'm Nate Ganymede.

38:05.576 --> 38:06.744
Oh, wait.

38:06.844 --> 38:07.878
Excuse me.

38:07.978 --> 38:09.978
Oh.

38:23.745 --> 38:25.779
You will stop for me.

38:29.817 --> 38:31.817
Hey, cool.

38:31.986 --> 38:33.986
Kate?

38:34.955 --> 38:38.776
This is one of Kassell's early
designs and the first runner.

38:38.876 --> 38:39.977
Your dad loves this jacket.

38:40.077 --> 38:40.878
This is insane.

38:40.978 --> 38:42.978
Good luck.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.706
This will work.

38:53.791 --> 38:55.791
Oh, yes.

38:56.977 --> 39:00.698
Well, I think we should at
least consider his offer.

39:00.798 --> 39:02.798
I hate Frost Apparel.

39:02.833 --> 39:06.604
Colin Frost has been stealing my ideas...

39:06.704 --> 39:08.939
since we were students together.

39:09.039 --> 39:12.525
Well, that is what competitors do.

39:15.963 --> 39:19.050
What the hell happened here?

39:19.150 --> 39:20.685
I don't know, honey.

39:20.785 --> 39:23.080
Online shopping, yoga pants.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.030
People used to smile at work here.

39:32.748 --> 39:36.701
Designers used to stay up
all night working together...

39:36.801 --> 39:39.946
just to get one piece perfect.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.923
It felt like family.

39:49.931 --> 39:51.931
Is this gonna work?

39:54.769 --> 39:56.769
Okay, stop it.

39:57.037 --> 39:59.056
Do what Richard would do.

39:59.156 --> 40:01.875
Do what Richard would do.

40:03.078 --> 40:05.580
Kassell Clothing,
one moment, please.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.065
Kassell Clothing... please hold.

40:08.165 --> 40:10.165
Kassell...

40:10.684 --> 40:11.702
Good afternoon.

40:11.802 --> 40:12.470
Nate Ganymede.

40:12.570 --> 40:14.505
I'm Lee Kassell's two o'clock.

40:14.605 --> 40:16.507
Actually, I believe you're meeting Elise.

40:16.607 --> 40:17.975
I don't think so.

40:18.075 --> 40:20.075
Um...

40:23.197 --> 40:25.038
Lee Kassell, please report to reception.

40:25.049 --> 40:28.552
Your two o'clock is
here and looking fabulous.

40:28.652 --> 40:29.387
Give me that.

40:29.487 --> 40:32.207
I'll be needing a security pass.

40:32.873 --> 40:34.874
Nate Ganymede.

40:37.111 --> 40:38.729
Take off your glasses.

40:38.829 --> 40:40.564
And ruin this ensemble?

40:40.664 --> 40:41.532
Forget it.

40:41.632 --> 40:42.867
Due diligence.

40:42.967 --> 40:45.903
Last I checked the eyes
were the windows to the soul.

40:46.003 --> 40:48.038
Darling, we're in fashion.

40:48.138 --> 40:51.057
You don't want me to have a soul.

40:58.632 --> 41:00.632
Hmm.

41:00.734 --> 41:04.722
So you trained at Parsons.

41:04.822 --> 41:10.961
Interned at Dior and two
years in house at Zoom.

41:11.061 --> 41:12.797
Why'd you want to work at Kassell?

41:12.897 --> 41:14.137
Because you've lost your way...

41:14.164 --> 41:16.867
and I'm the man to
help you find it again.

41:16.967 --> 41:20.838
Your customers are bored.

41:20.938 --> 41:22.938
So am I.

41:23.090 --> 41:27.144
Ah, Nate this is the CEO of our company,

41:27.244 --> 41:29.244
Lee Kassell.

41:29.730 --> 41:30.730
Pleased to meet you, sir.

41:30.781 --> 41:31.715
Hello, Nathan.

41:31.815 --> 41:33.634
Hello.

41:33.734 --> 41:35.085
Nate is, uh...

41:35.185 --> 41:37.185
I know it.

41:38.239 --> 41:41.341
Autumn Expressions 1993 collection.

41:42.010 --> 41:43.360
Right? Right?

41:43.460 --> 41:44.829
Yes, the jacket.

41:44.929 --> 41:46.697
Vintage, uh, Kassell.

41:46.797 --> 41:48.165
What they used to call a runner.

41:48.265 --> 41:50.601
Yes.

41:50.701 --> 41:51.769
This is Nate.

41:51.869 --> 41:54.419
The one Serge called us about.

41:54.922 --> 41:57.047
Have we met before, Nate?

41:58.025 --> 41:59.710
Not in this incarnation.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.128
Hmm.

42:01.228 --> 42:05.883
Nate was just telling me
that he finds Kassell boring.

42:05.983 --> 42:09.468
It's a bold strategy for a job interview.

42:10.170 --> 42:11.255
Boring?

42:11.355 --> 42:12.156
How so?

42:12.256 --> 42:13.691
Oh, honey, I can handle...

42:13.791 --> 42:16.794
I'd go to Kassell
to see something new.

42:16.894 --> 42:19.630
Now I go there and see
what I see everywhere else.

42:19.730 --> 42:22.700
I don't think your
designers are being challenged...

42:22.800 --> 42:24.668
to come up with surprises.

42:24.768 --> 42:27.171
Well, surprises can be disastrous.

42:27.271 --> 42:28.839
Exactly.

42:28.939 --> 42:31.008
Take this jacket, for example.

42:31.108 --> 42:33.878
It could have been a
disaster but it works...

42:33.978 --> 42:36.013
and the customers told you that.

42:36.113 --> 42:38.749
Yeah, we sold a million
of these coats at least.

42:38.849 --> 42:40.751
Literally a million, uh huh.

42:40.851 --> 42:43.687
And we opened six
other stores with this.

42:43.787 --> 42:45.789
Kassell's one of the
few companies left with,

42:45.889 --> 42:47.858
uh, in-house manufacturing.

42:47.958 --> 42:49.159
Only for samples.

42:49.259 --> 42:51.128
Why not try limited runs.

42:51.228 --> 42:52.897
Lee, what luck.

42:52.997 --> 42:56.066
Nate is not only a
designer but also a businessman.

42:56.166 --> 43:00.838
Yes, but we have discussed
limited runs haven't we?

43:00.938 --> 43:04.074
But every sample costs us
thousands of dollars to make.

43:04.174 --> 43:06.911
I mean, this is all very
inspiring but talk is cheap.

43:07.011 --> 43:08.896
You're right.

43:08.996 --> 43:12.783
So Nate, you, uh,
you like surprises, do you?

43:12.883 --> 43:14.668
I do. Yes.

43:14.768 --> 43:16.768
Well then, surprise me.

43:17.004 --> 43:18.989
Bring me something
unique but simple enough...

43:19.089 --> 43:20.908
to build in-house.

43:21.008 --> 43:23.227
Consider it done.

43:23.327 --> 43:28.766
If I like it, we're going
to put your theory to test.

43:28.866 --> 43:30.866
You won't be sorry.

43:31.319 --> 43:32.736
Oh, come on.

43:32.836 --> 43:34.876
Let's have a little fun.

43:41.295 --> 43:43.295
Friday.

43:53.308 --> 43:55.308
Friday.

43:55.442 --> 43:57.211
Friday.

43:57.311 --> 44:00.264
I still can't believe that worked.

44:00.364 --> 44:01.749
What?

44:01.849 --> 44:03.067
You guaranteed me it would.

44:03.167 --> 44:05.207
Well, I'm on medication.

44:05.302 --> 44:06.971
Strong medication.

44:07.071 --> 44:09.006
You should never listen to me.

44:09.106 --> 44:09.873
Congratulations.

44:09.973 --> 44:11.375
You are now a designer.

44:11.475 --> 44:13.777
That's exactly my problem.

44:13.877 --> 44:15.212
I don't have anything to present.

44:15.312 --> 44:18.148
Elise has already seen my portfolio.

44:18.248 --> 44:20.651
There is nothing that
they have not seen before.

44:20.751 --> 44:21.285
No.

44:21.385 --> 44:23.385
There must be.

44:28.976 --> 44:30.976
Yes.

44:31.879 --> 44:33.879
Yes.

44:36.884 --> 44:40.404
Dad and Elise missed
my school showcase.

44:40.504 --> 44:42.039
They haven't seen this one yet.

44:42.139 --> 44:47.945
If you had an attentive father,
you wouldn't have been able to...

44:48.045 --> 44:50.014
trick him into
distributing your designs.

44:50.114 --> 44:50.881
Ahh.

44:50.981 --> 44:56.369
Oh Kate, that is absolutely stunning.

44:58.473 --> 45:00.938
The hautest of haute couture.

45:00.991 --> 45:03.966
Kassell should be knocking you off.

45:04.044 --> 45:07.274
And that's just what they'll be doing.

45:23.997 --> 45:25.416
Welcome, everybody.

45:25.516 --> 45:28.852
We are here to reveal our new line:

45:28.952 --> 45:30.354
Touch of Glamour.

45:30.454 --> 45:34.091
So it's a mixture of glamour and touching.

45:34.191 --> 45:36.191
Go ahead, touch it.

45:36.410 --> 45:40.898
We also have a variety of animal
prints for a sustainable living...

45:40.998 --> 45:43.233
and you can really mix
it up with this piece.

45:43.333 --> 45:46.003
Work at drinks; Your choice.

45:46.103 --> 45:49.440
A couple of accessories
in the bathroom and tada.

45:49.540 --> 45:50.974
Is this daywear?

45:51.074 --> 45:52.192
Yes.

45:52.292 --> 45:55.182
Because it looks like eveningwear.

45:55.245 --> 45:56.513
Yes.

45:56.613 --> 45:57.414
All right.

45:57.514 --> 45:58.248
Thank you.

45:58.348 --> 45:58.982
Love it.

45:59.082 --> 46:00.284
Practical and affordable.

46:00.384 --> 46:02.019
Boring, predictable.

46:02.119 --> 46:03.120
Wait.

46:03.220 --> 46:07.891
We have one more pitch
from a Mr. Nate Ganymede.

46:07.991 --> 46:09.276
Present.

46:09.376 --> 46:11.995
I don't think you go
from day to nightwear...

46:12.095 --> 46:15.466
by adding earrings and a
pair of sparkly heels.

46:15.566 --> 46:17.000
Now that's just me.

46:17.100 --> 46:18.001
All right.

46:18.101 --> 46:21.454
This is Everyday Princess.

46:23.490 --> 46:26.359
Trust me to transform.

46:29.096 --> 46:31.148
Women don't want a
Touch of Glamour.

46:31.248 --> 46:33.150
They wanna be the belle of the ball.

46:33.250 --> 46:34.985
You know what women want?

46:35.085 --> 46:36.987
I wanna be the belle of the ball.

46:37.087 --> 46:39.022
I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna speak.

46:39.122 --> 46:41.024
Just because you work a 9 to 5...

46:41.124 --> 46:45.884
doesn't mean you don't dream
of becoming someone else.

46:46.580 --> 46:48.580
Here we are.

46:49.149 --> 46:53.370
Who wouldn't want to take
this lovely lady for a spin?

46:53.470 --> 46:55.506
You made that sample in two days?

46:55.606 --> 46:56.373
Yeah.

46:56.473 --> 46:58.041
It's just something I whipped up.

46:58.141 --> 47:01.178
Forget about 6:30 cocktails.

47:01.278 --> 47:04.381
Let's start thinking
about that midnight kiss.

47:04.481 --> 47:08.185
Special occasions are not our forte.

47:08.285 --> 47:09.703
Lee?

47:09.803 --> 47:14.307
Yes, well unfortunately that is true.

47:18.445 --> 47:23.500
But, um, I think we
should take a shot at this.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.385
You're hired.

47:25.485 --> 47:28.372
Lee, are you reverting
to impulse decisions?

47:28.472 --> 47:29.473
We worked on that.

47:29.573 --> 47:31.008
Everyone, that's it.

47:31.108 --> 47:33.108
Let's get back to work.

47:44.638 --> 47:49.459
Nate, do you know there's
something about your work...

47:49.559 --> 47:52.629
that reminds me of the
way Kassell used to be.

47:52.729 --> 47:54.047
Hmm.

47:54.147 --> 47:56.147
It's quite wonderful.

47:56.283 --> 48:02.039
So let's get you a station
so you can get to work.

48:02.139 --> 48:03.440
This is Nate's resume.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.374
Look into him.

48:04.474 --> 48:05.342
Dig up dirt.

48:05.442 --> 48:07.122
If we're lucky we'll find some leverage...

48:07.210 --> 48:10.147
that can pry him out of Lee's favour.

48:10.247 --> 48:11.248
What?

48:11.348 --> 48:12.188
Don't talk in unison.

48:12.249 --> 48:13.517
It's creepy.

48:13.617 --> 48:15.617
Sorry, Mom.

48:17.271 --> 48:19.271
Hey.

48:20.608 --> 48:23.260
We weren't planning anything.

48:23.360 --> 48:27.331
Do you know where I
might find some buttons?

48:27.431 --> 48:28.498
Well, this is just...

48:28.598 --> 48:30.400
this is just spectacular.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.668
What an exquisitely ordered room.

48:31.768 --> 48:34.137
Whoever did this should
really get a promotion.

48:34.237 --> 48:36.139
Well, she doesn't work
at the company anymore.

48:36.239 --> 48:38.141
Well, what happened to her?

48:38.241 --> 48:41.386
Same thing that's
gonna happen to you.

48:41.728 --> 48:44.081
All right.

48:44.181 --> 48:46.084
Look, sugar tits.
I know that your mom...

48:46.184 --> 48:47.068
runs the company...

48:47.168 --> 48:49.286
and all but I don't
take crap from anyone,

48:49.386 --> 48:53.190
especially two mediocre talents
who are in way over their heads.

48:53.290 --> 48:56.410
Now if you want war. I'll give you war.

48:56.510 --> 49:01.565
But trust me,
you don't want war.

49:01.665 --> 49:03.665
All right.

49:05.452 --> 49:07.452
That was weird.

49:09.189 --> 49:11.408
You are my hero.

49:11.508 --> 49:14.344
No one talks to those two like that.

49:14.444 --> 49:17.581
I just say what I feel and regret it later.

49:17.681 --> 49:21.084
Please,
don't regret, sugar tits.

49:21.184 --> 49:23.220
We should do
something to celebrate.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.454
To welcome you to Kassell.

49:24.554 --> 49:26.189
Oh no.
That's just... it's really.

49:26.289 --> 49:30.093
Just leave it with me; Drinking, dancing.

49:30.193 --> 49:32.229
We'll blow the night away.

49:32.329 --> 49:33.130
Oh, Daniel.

49:33.230 --> 49:35.165
You should come with us for drinks?

49:35.265 --> 49:36.733
Welcome me to Kassell.
Maurice is organizing.

49:36.833 --> 49:39.736
Oh, Daniel doesn't like to go out.

49:39.836 --> 49:41.521
I'm in.

49:41.621 --> 49:44.681
Just don't let him choose the place.

49:46.194 --> 49:48.578
Oh, it's a shame he's straight, isn't it?

49:48.678 --> 49:51.114
If you're into that kind of thing.

49:51.214 --> 49:53.216
French, gorgeous.

49:53.316 --> 49:55.316
Trust issues.

49:56.670 --> 50:00.190
About five years ago, he caught
his fiancée letting someone else...

50:00.290 --> 50:02.426
dip his fork into her fondue.

50:02.526 --> 50:03.627
And by fondue I mean...

50:03.727 --> 50:05.429
Yeah, I get the idea.

50:05.529 --> 50:07.664
He hasn't dated since.

50:07.764 --> 50:09.967
He hasn't even put the train...

50:10.067 --> 50:10.767
Yup, yup, yup.

50:10.867 --> 50:12.907
I, uh, I figured it out.

50:14.488 --> 50:16.488
See you tonight?

50:21.562 --> 50:23.562
Isn't this great.

50:23.764 --> 50:25.949
Told you not to let him pick the place.

50:26.049 --> 50:28.049
To the bar.

50:29.237 --> 50:30.537
What?

50:30.637 --> 50:32.637
Vodka.

50:34.708 --> 50:36.259
All right.

50:36.359 --> 50:38.762
To the font of all inspiration.

50:38.862 --> 50:40.147
Cheers.

50:40.247 --> 50:42.247
Cheers.

50:45.285 --> 50:46.103
Another round.

50:46.203 --> 50:46.770
Yeah.

50:46.870 --> 50:47.771
Cheers.

50:47.871 --> 50:49.871
Cheers.

51:24.991 --> 51:26.276
It's cool, Nate.
It's alright...

51:26.376 --> 51:28.756
It's okay. It's cool.

51:33.768 --> 51:35.402
Ah.

51:35.502 --> 51:37.502
You're home early.

51:40.774 --> 51:42.774
Uh oh, what's wrong?

51:46.313 --> 51:48.465
I've installed some spyware so,

51:48.565 --> 51:51.301
if somebody steals your
design, you'll know.

51:51.401 --> 51:54.738
And I've hidden your
folder on the network.

51:54.838 --> 51:55.806
Wonder what's in this...

51:55.906 --> 51:57.474
Don't open those.

51:57.574 --> 51:59.843
It's a decoy design as a precaution.

51:59.943 --> 52:02.813
Just please, don't look at it.

52:02.913 --> 52:04.314
Hey, hey, hey.

52:04.414 --> 52:06.414
What is it?

52:06.534 --> 52:11.321
A hideous idea from
my older years at Kassell.

52:11.421 --> 52:13.421
Alien chic.

52:14.908 --> 52:16.908
No.

52:18.712 --> 52:19.696
Ohh.

52:19.796 --> 52:20.864
What happened?

52:20.964 --> 52:22.699
What is that?

52:22.799 --> 52:25.009
That-that was the 2000's.

52:25.886 --> 52:27.886
Everything was shiny.

52:29.456 --> 52:31.891
Okay, I have no defense.

52:36.263 --> 52:37.364
Hey.

52:37.464 --> 52:39.616
Um, nope... I... bye.

52:39.716 --> 52:40.617
You ignoring me?

52:40.717 --> 52:41.785
Nope.

52:41.885 --> 52:42.966
You're totally ignoring me.

52:42.986 --> 52:43.787
Nope.

52:43.887 --> 52:45.755
Just really gotta...

52:45.855 --> 52:46.523
Come on, Nate.

52:46.623 --> 52:47.657
Gotta skedaddle.

52:47.757 --> 52:49.893
You're not the first guy to think I'm gay.

52:49.993 --> 52:51.595
I wasn't ignoring you.

52:51.695 --> 52:54.500
I'm usually very good at telling.

52:54.581 --> 52:57.534
Well, you've put yourself out there.

52:57.634 --> 53:02.655
It takes balls and I could
learn a thing or two from you.

53:04.457 --> 53:05.892
Hmm.

53:05.992 --> 53:12.398
Does Mr. Bergeron carry a
little torch for someone?

53:13.466 --> 53:14.835
Nope.

53:14.935 --> 53:16.636
Really.

53:16.736 --> 53:17.554
No one?

53:17.654 --> 53:18.355
No.

53:18.455 --> 53:20.455
Nobody?

53:20.607 --> 53:22.607
Aw, come on.

53:22.659 --> 53:24.659
You can tell me.

53:28.848 --> 53:31.434
She's a designer. Kate.

53:31.534 --> 53:35.305
She was working here
before you arrived...

53:35.405 --> 53:41.478
and she's talented but humble.

53:41.578 --> 53:43.980
She has no idea how beautiful she is.

53:44.080 --> 53:47.584
She's the opposite of everyone here.

53:47.684 --> 53:51.036
And, um, I don't know.

53:52.572 --> 53:55.717
I just can't stop thinking about her.

53:55.909 --> 53:59.296
It sounds too good to be true.

53:59.396 --> 54:00.564
Yup.

54:00.664 --> 54:01.765
Y'know, I've been burned before.

54:01.865 --> 54:03.505
She doesn't really
look interested anyway.

54:03.566 --> 54:06.619
She is... I wager.

54:07.354 --> 54:09.339
You simply must find out.

54:09.439 --> 54:11.439
I'm dying of curiosity.

54:14.594 --> 54:16.594
Yeah, you're right.

54:17.732 --> 54:21.618
What, um, are you calling
her right at this moment?

54:21.718 --> 54:22.619
Yeah.

54:22.719 --> 54:23.386
You're right.

54:23.486 --> 54:26.121
I'll-I'll give it one more try.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.592
You know, I-I just...
I left something...

54:28.692 --> 54:30.293
I'm just gonna give you privacy.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.393
Okay?

54:45.558 --> 54:46.743
Daniel?

54:46.843 --> 54:48.278
Hi.

54:48.378 --> 54:50.914
Hey, I was just, um,
thinking about you.

54:51.014 --> 54:52.249
Yeah.

54:52.349 --> 54:54.618
I've been, I've-I've been
working at this vintage shop...

54:54.718 --> 54:56.593
called After The Ball,
and we just got...

54:56.693 --> 54:57.774
these 80's stilettos in,

54:57.805 --> 55:03.927
and I was like,
Daniel has to see these.

55:04.027 --> 55:07.497
You should, um,
you should come by.

55:07.597 --> 55:08.698
Yeah, sure.

55:08.798 --> 55:10.567
Seriously, drop by any time.

55:10.667 --> 55:11.434
Okay.

55:11.534 --> 55:12.269
Okay.

55:12.369 --> 55:14.369
Okay, bye.

55:24.798 --> 55:26.798
Yes, I... you know...

55:31.672 --> 55:33.672
Yes.

55:35.009 --> 55:37.576
Why is he so happy?

55:38.511 --> 55:40.511
So how did it go?

55:43.383 --> 55:44.801
Thanks, I mean,
you-you were right.

55:44.901 --> 55:49.739
She-she invited me
to stop by her work.

55:49.839 --> 55:52.876
So, um, I'm knocking off early.

55:52.976 --> 55:54.344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:54.444 --> 55:55.178
No, no, no.

55:55.278 --> 55:56.680
You're-you're going right now?

55:56.780 --> 55:58.665
Yeah.

55:58.765 --> 56:02.585
Wait, oh you can't.

56:02.685 --> 56:03.720
Why?

56:03.820 --> 56:09.793
Um, oh gosh, look at,
look at the roads.

56:09.893 --> 56:11.528
There's traffic just...

56:11.628 --> 56:13.753
Wish me luck, buddy.

56:38.072 --> 56:40.072
Halt.

56:44.944 --> 56:48.431
A man is just about to
come out and get in this cab.

56:48.531 --> 56:50.934
It is very important that, um,

56:51.034 --> 56:54.771
you don't take him on expressways.

56:54.871 --> 56:59.206
He has a real, uh, dizziness
problem on expressways.

57:02.997 --> 57:04.581
Oh, man.

57:04.681 --> 57:07.784
Sounds like you
want me to delay him, uh?

57:07.884 --> 57:09.602
Uh?

57:09.702 --> 57:11.471
Ohh.

57:11.571 --> 57:13.571
60 bucks.

57:13.907 --> 57:15.907
Yeah.

57:29.789 --> 57:31.541
Vintage clothes?

57:31.641 --> 57:33.543
Like old clothes worn by other people.

57:33.643 --> 57:35.643
Ew, I need a shower.

57:46.807 --> 57:49.025
Why are you singing that?

57:49.125 --> 57:54.079
Oh, because-because
we're spies... we're spying.

57:59.053 --> 58:00.737
Is that Daniel?

58:00.837 --> 58:01.971
Daniel drives a cab.

58:02.071 --> 58:03.706
No, getting out of the cab.

58:03.806 --> 58:04.607
Yeah.

58:04.707 --> 58:05.708
Getting out.

58:05.808 --> 58:06.876
Going into the same place.

58:06.976 --> 58:08.711
Maybe they're working together.

58:08.811 --> 58:11.701
Or maybe they're having an affair.

58:22.776 --> 58:24.776
Okay.

58:31.050 --> 58:32.535
Hey.

58:32.635 --> 58:34.237
You came?

58:34.337 --> 58:34.971
Wow.

58:35.071 --> 58:37.071
You look great.

58:37.073 --> 58:39.091
You've got something...

58:40.093 --> 58:42.093
Oh, yeah.

58:42.111 --> 58:44.848
It's, uh, a cheek cleanser.

58:44.948 --> 58:46.948
Um, come in.

58:48.668 --> 58:50.787
Kate lives here too.

58:50.887 --> 58:51.888
Of course.

58:51.988 --> 58:53.690
Daniel and Kate are the spies...

58:53.790 --> 58:56.125
leaking Kassell designs, Simone.

58:56.225 --> 58:56.960
Phew.

58:57.060 --> 58:57.760
Solved.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.028
I just solved it.

58:59.128 --> 59:01.128
It's us, dummy.

59:01.180 --> 59:01.865
Us.

59:01.965 --> 59:04.734
We're leaking the designs.

59:04.834 --> 59:05.635
Mm hmm.

59:05.735 --> 59:06.936
Do you remember...?

59:07.036 --> 59:11.657
Yeah, no I just... that...
you make a good point.

59:16.964 --> 59:18.964
I'm quite impressed.

59:18.982 --> 59:21.818
I didn't take you for a
chocolate connoisseur.

59:21.918 --> 59:24.654
There's a world of things
you don't know about me.

59:24.754 --> 59:28.591
A world of manly
things you don't know.

59:28.691 --> 59:30.691
Hmm.

59:32.712 --> 59:37.934
I tried to call you a
couple times since you left.

59:38.034 --> 59:39.619
I tried.

59:39.719 --> 59:41.719
I didn't succeed.

59:43.756 --> 59:45.525
Why not?

59:45.625 --> 59:48.978
Um, I don't know.

59:49.078 --> 59:53.932
I'm a little bit out of
practice and an idiot.

59:55.301 --> 59:57.654
Well, don't let that stop you.

59:57.754 --> 59:59.754
Hah.

59:59.772 --> 01:00:04.107
It's not easy for me
asking out the boss's daughter.

01:00:04.777 --> 01:00:06.257
Well, we're out right now, aren't we?

01:00:06.329 --> 01:00:08.164
It's not the same.

01:00:08.264 --> 01:00:11.883
I didn't ask and you know.

01:00:13.052 --> 01:00:15.052
Okay, well ask me.

01:00:15.855 --> 01:00:17.140
Where do you wanna go?
Anywhere.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240
I promise I'll say yes.

01:00:20.259 --> 01:00:21.177
No matter where?

01:00:21.277 --> 01:00:21.978
Mm hmm.

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:24.078
You name it.

01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:36.842
Do you want to go to the
Fashion Week Ball with me?

01:00:40.713 --> 01:00:42.098
Oh my God.

01:00:42.198 --> 01:00:43.232
I... yes, yes.

01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:46.135
Of course, I'll go with you.

01:00:46.235 --> 01:00:47.337
It took a long time.

01:00:47.437 --> 01:00:48.137
You're sure.

01:00:48.237 --> 01:00:49.739
Yes, yes. I would love to.

01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:51.224
Okay, good.

01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:51.975
Okay?

01:00:52.075 --> 01:00:53.076
Okay.

01:00:53.176 --> 01:00:53.843
Hello.

01:00:53.943 --> 01:00:55.979
I'm calling about Nate Ganymede.

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:58.881
We have just hired him
here at Kassell Designs...

01:00:58.981 --> 01:01:02.852
and I was just wondering, did
he work well with others?

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:03.786
Really.

01:01:03.886 --> 01:01:05.886
Team player.

01:01:06.072 --> 01:01:08.157
Employee of the month.

01:01:08.257 --> 01:01:10.257
What month?

01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:18.101
Versace.

01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:21.004
Sergio,.

01:01:21.104 --> 01:01:23.909
I'm sorry I do not speak foreign.

01:01:25.024 --> 01:01:25.642
Buongiorno.

01:01:25.742 --> 01:01:26.476
Gucci.

01:01:26.576 --> 01:01:27.710
Come va?

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:28.411
Bonjour.

01:01:28.511 --> 01:01:30.146
Chanel.

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:32.246
Dolce Gabbanna.

01:01:33.934 --> 01:01:35.351
I'm telling you this for nothing.

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:37.720
If he had worked here another month...

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.774
he would have discovered
the cure for cancer.

01:01:41.874 --> 01:01:43.874
Everybody loves Nate.

01:01:43.943 --> 01:01:46.729
I think I might be starting to love Nate.

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:49.039
We are so screwed, Simone.

01:01:51.718 --> 01:01:52.368
Don't worry.

01:01:52.468 --> 01:01:54.468
We'll figure it out.

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:08.785
This is it.

01:02:08.885 --> 01:02:09.919
Are you nervous?

01:02:10.019 --> 01:02:12.037
Oh, I may faint.

01:02:12.805 --> 01:02:13.923
This is good, right.

01:02:14.023 --> 01:02:15.758
I mean, it looks good.

01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:19.028
Elise, let's uh, set Nate up
with press for the trades.

01:02:19.128 --> 01:02:20.930
Is it worth it for a dress?

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:24.233
No, but they want to talk to the
designer of the new fall line.

01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:25.768
This early fall?

01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:27.103
Mm hmm.

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:28.171
Oh geez.

01:02:28.271 --> 01:02:29.972
What about Tannis and Simone's line,

01:02:30.072 --> 01:02:32.241
Touch of Glam?

01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:36.045
No, no, no, we're not going to do that.

01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:37.914
I'll need somewhere private to work, Lee.

01:02:38.014 --> 01:02:40.014
Don't worry about that.

01:02:40.016 --> 01:02:44.120
Well, it's a little late to
turn back the orders from China.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.290
Well, why not do it in-house?

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.058
Put those dusty machines to use.

01:02:49.158 --> 01:02:50.226
Excellent idea.

01:02:50.326 --> 01:02:51.160
That's a big risk.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.365
Ah, Colin, I hope
you washed your hands?

01:02:56.465 --> 01:03:00.970
You know I don't carry
germs unless I can accessorize.

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:04.040
Well, Lee, it looks like you have a hit.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.876
We'll see how the
numbers add up, Colin.

01:03:06.976 --> 01:03:08.411
Please keep my offer in mind.

01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:11.080
Kassel Frost has a nice ring to it.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.281
Like breaking glass.

01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:15.017
By way this is my new designer, Nate.

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:16.185
Nate, Colin.

01:03:16.285 --> 01:03:20.025
Oh, well you've always
had an eye for talent.

01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:22.892
Oh, look at the time.

01:03:22.992 --> 01:03:25.261
I have an 11 o'clock with the Pope.

01:03:25.361 --> 01:03:27.361
Needs a new hat.

01:03:27.948 --> 01:03:29.866
He is funny.
I'll give him that.

01:03:29.966 --> 01:03:32.001
I wonder what the hell he's doing here.

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:33.920
Who cares?

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.505
I have the perfect place for you to work.

01:03:40.227 --> 01:03:41.994
A runner?

01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:43.379
How could you let this happen?

01:03:43.479 --> 01:03:45.882
This is a serious setback.

01:03:45.982 --> 01:03:47.283
Just play your part.

01:03:47.383 --> 01:03:49.352
Let me worry about
bringing Kassell down.

01:03:49.452 --> 01:03:52.370
Who was that... Nate?

01:03:52.939 --> 01:03:53.923
I don't know him.

01:03:54.023 --> 01:03:54.991
I know everyone.

01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:56.125
Relax.

01:03:56.225 --> 01:04:00.163
Nate has convinced Lee to
produce his line in-house.

01:04:00.263 --> 01:04:03.366
It is so risky that even one slip up...

01:04:03.466 --> 01:04:07.270
and we are back on the shopping
block cheaper than ever.

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:12.275
That is the moment to close
the deal once and for all.

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:14.375
Woo.

01:04:16.262 --> 01:04:17.864
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:17.964 --> 01:04:20.149
This Nate has his own line.

01:04:20.249 --> 01:04:21.918
Don't worry.

01:04:22.018 --> 01:04:25.418
It will be useless if you have it first.

01:04:26.172 --> 01:04:28.807
I love the way you say useless.

01:04:30.176 --> 01:04:32.176
The moment's over.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.248
So here we are.

01:04:38.217 --> 01:04:40.342
Every piece we ever made.

01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:45.557
We have one copy here
including the first...

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:53.064
and I was the only one with the key.

01:04:59.972 --> 01:05:01.972
Ah.

01:05:04.043 --> 01:05:07.997
Amanda and I did
something right at Kassell.

01:05:08.097 --> 01:05:10.097
Once upon a time.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:16.505
But then she passed...

01:05:16.605 --> 01:05:20.209
and I haven't been
able to find it since.

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:23.446
But maybe you can.

01:05:23.546 --> 01:05:26.436
Here I want to show you something.

01:05:33.406 --> 01:05:37.442
It was 1989 in London.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.395
I was at a party.

01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:42.314
A really rather dull party...

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:49.054
and then I saw her
standing in the doorway.

01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:51.440
She was wearing this skirt...

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:56.012
and cherry red Doc Marten boots.

01:05:56.112 --> 01:06:01.083
So tough but pretty at the same time.

01:06:01.183 --> 01:06:02.551
I'd never seen anything like it.

01:06:02.651 --> 01:06:06.071
So I knocked off the skirt and I,

01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:09.179
and I married the woman.

01:06:13.045 --> 01:06:15.264
Even now, there's not
a day that goes by...

01:06:15.364 --> 01:06:18.424
that I don't think about her.

01:06:22.054 --> 01:06:26.191
Do you know that my
daughter is just like her?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.464
Almost exact
and lives, breathes fashion.

01:06:38.337 --> 01:06:40.323
Of course, I was hoping...

01:06:40.423 --> 01:06:43.908
that she'd take over the business.

01:06:45.244 --> 01:06:47.244
Really?

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:55.453
Yeah... but... she hates me.

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:02.494
Deep down I think
it's probably my fault.

01:07:05.664 --> 01:07:08.299
Are you close with your father?

01:07:10.202 --> 01:07:11.087
Yes.

01:07:11.187 --> 01:07:13.005
Yes, I am.

01:07:13.105 --> 01:07:15.057
The fact is every time I saw Kate,

01:07:15.157 --> 01:07:17.259
I saw her mother and I couldn't stand it,

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:19.359
so I pushed her away,

01:07:20.212 --> 01:07:23.017
But I wish I could make it right.

01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:25.582
Maybe you can.

01:07:27.586 --> 01:07:29.372
It's complicated.

01:07:29.472 --> 01:07:31.574
Anyway, let's talk of other things.

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:33.674
Yes.

01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:36.145
Are you all right?

01:07:36.245 --> 01:07:40.683
Yeah, it's just, uh;
It's a very moving story.

01:07:40.783 --> 01:07:42.284
Oh, well.

01:07:42.384 --> 01:07:45.421
Now... it's all yours.

01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:46.589
Perfect.

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:50.174
I'm expecting great
things from you, Nate.

01:08:22.774 --> 01:08:24.660
Right, right.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.760
Nate.

01:08:27.746 --> 01:08:29.598
What a great sight.

01:08:29.698 --> 01:08:31.149
Ha.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.386
Making our own clothes again.

01:08:33.486 --> 01:08:35.470
Monday trades are going to read...

01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.407
'Kassell brings
production back home.'

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:39.742
Just lovely, isn't it.

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:40.743
It swells the heart.

01:08:40.843 --> 01:08:41.577
Yes, it does.

01:08:41.676 --> 01:08:43.479
It certainly does.

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.413
Of course, it also swells our expenses,

01:08:45.514 --> 01:08:48.633
But let's hope your idea pays off.

01:08:49.468 --> 01:08:51.203
Of course it will.

01:08:51.303 --> 01:08:53.303
Bravo, gentlemen.

01:08:54.273 --> 01:08:56.273
Of course it will.

01:08:57.376 --> 01:08:58.727
Can you see anything?

01:08:58.827 --> 01:09:00.827
No.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.430
Can you?

01:09:02.531 --> 01:09:04.531
No.

01:09:04.617 --> 01:09:06.617
What're you doing?

01:09:09.755 --> 01:09:13.442
Nate is totally hogging the archive.

01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:15.921
Can you speak to him please?

01:09:23.336 --> 01:09:24.620
Nate.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.538
Yes?

01:09:26.639 --> 01:09:28.224
Well, may I come in?

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:30.323
Yes, please.

01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:31.393
Oh.

01:09:31.493 --> 01:09:33.545
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.045
These are very preliminary...

01:09:39.285 --> 01:09:43.194
but I think that you
get the sense of it.

01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:48.792
Oh.

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:51.412
What do you call it?

01:09:51.513 --> 01:09:53.782
'Girls Will Be Boys.'

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:55.267
Fantastic.

01:09:55.367 --> 01:09:56.685
I have an idea.

01:09:56.785 --> 01:10:01.524
We'll drop the name at
the Fashion Ball tonight.

01:10:01.624 --> 01:10:04.660
Oh, you're just going to have
such a great time doing that.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.463
It will be when you
introduce it to the press.

01:10:07.563 --> 01:10:09.265
Oh, um, no.

01:10:09.365 --> 01:10:10.299
I'm not going.

01:10:10.399 --> 01:10:11.800
Did you say you're not going?

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.769
Yeah, I can't, I can't make it.

01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:15.471
You realize you have an interview...

01:10:15.571 --> 01:10:16.605
with Women's Wear Weekly.

01:10:16.705 --> 01:10:19.341
The girls told you that,
did they not?

01:10:19.441 --> 01:10:20.142
Yes.

01:10:20.242 --> 01:10:20.976
Well, no.

01:10:21.076 --> 01:10:23.646
They... I didn't really hear that.

01:10:23.746 --> 01:10:24.626
Hear them saying that.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.349
Well then let me
explain something to you.

01:10:27.449 --> 01:10:29.585
That interview sets up
the whole year for Kassell.

01:10:29.685 --> 01:10:32.855
It is a tradition and it is key.

01:10:32.955 --> 01:10:34.623
Let me repeat.

01:10:34.723 --> 01:10:36.792
Key for our marketing.

01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:42.364
I would, oh, I would
really love to but I just...

01:10:42.464 --> 01:10:44.400
y'know I'm just in over my head here.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.803
Nate, you're the new
designer for Kassell.

01:10:47.903 --> 01:10:49.903
It's not a negotiation.

01:10:49.905 --> 01:10:51.905
You're going.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:55.959
Oh.

01:10:56.862 --> 01:10:57.580
Go on.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.680
What? It's not like...

01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:11.844
Nothing.

01:11:11.944 --> 01:11:13.429
Nate takes all of his his sketchbooks...

01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:14.763
home with him at night.

01:11:14.863 --> 01:11:16.348
Whoa.

01:11:16.448 --> 01:11:17.766
Forget sketches.

01:11:17.866 --> 01:11:20.536
My Colin is going
to need the design files...

01:11:20.636 --> 01:11:23.539
if we're going to get a
jump on production.

01:11:23.639 --> 01:11:25.474
Oh, there it is.

01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:27.574
The Early Fall Line.

01:11:27.576 --> 01:11:29.912
This is even better
than how we got Kate.

01:11:30.012 --> 01:11:31.680
Way better.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.433
Oh, this is our ticket to better, girls.

01:11:36.902 --> 01:11:38.902
Oh.

01:11:40.372 --> 01:11:43.541
To bigger and better things.

01:11:44.743 --> 01:11:49.431
Well, I have a lot more if
none of these work for you.

01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:50.566
Please stop, Bella.

01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:51.700
You don't understand.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.369
Eventually, one will speak to you.

01:11:53.469 --> 01:11:57.209
He wants me to do press
and pictures as Nate.

01:11:59.492 --> 01:12:00.843
We have a winner.

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:01.443
Okay.

01:12:01.543 --> 01:12:04.813
You'll look gorgeous. I have
just the thing. Hang on.

01:12:04.913 --> 01:12:05.581
No.

01:12:05.681 --> 01:12:06.682
Bella, I can't.

01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:07.683
Can't?

01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:09.451
Can't.

01:12:09.551 --> 01:12:12.388
Buttercup, have you learned nothing.

01:12:12.488 --> 01:12:15.891
If you think you can't do it,
then you can't do it.

01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:18.761
But what if you believe you can,

01:12:18.861 --> 01:12:23.499
and you arrive as Nate and you
do your best version of me...

01:12:23.599 --> 01:12:26.368
and you answer wild
and witty questions.

01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:30.539
Oh yeah, and then-then
you-you-you whisk off...

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:33.575
and you are Kate and then it's,

01:12:33.675 --> 01:12:35.878
'I'm just a girl standing
in front of a boy, '

01:12:35.978 --> 01:12:39.208
and you steal his heart and you dance.

01:12:41.534 --> 01:12:45.020
Honey, I used to do
five changes a show.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120
You can do one.

01:12:47.639 --> 01:12:48.957
Sounds easy when he says it.

01:12:49.057 --> 01:12:51.057
It always does.

01:12:51.126 --> 01:12:52.628
Ohhh.

01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:53.896
Wait... this is mine.

01:12:53.996 --> 01:12:56.498
It's gorgeous, Bella
but I'm arriving as Nate.

01:12:56.598 --> 01:12:57.666
I won't need a coat.

01:12:57.766 --> 01:12:58.901
What about the ride home?

01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:01.001
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

01:13:01.487 --> 01:13:03.487
Look.

01:13:27.079 --> 01:13:28.847
Nate.

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:30.999
Well, how about that?

01:13:31.099 --> 01:13:32.434
Oh, it's marvellous.

01:13:32.534 --> 01:13:33.135
Isn't it.

01:13:33.235 --> 01:13:34.036
Come with me.

01:13:34.136 --> 01:13:35.537
Now, listen.

01:13:35.637 --> 01:13:37.539
There's gonna be lots
of people you know...

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:39.875
and those you don't know
I'm going to introduce you.

01:13:39.975 --> 01:13:41.643
By the way, Ron is here.

01:13:41.743 --> 01:13:42.961
Who?

01:13:43.061 --> 01:13:45.061
Ron Sakamoto.

01:13:46.532 --> 01:13:47.649
From Zoom.

01:13:47.749 --> 01:13:49.685
You apprenticed with him.

01:13:49.785 --> 01:13:50.819
Ohhh.

01:13:50.919 --> 01:13:52.404
Ron.

01:13:52.504 --> 01:13:53.922
Yes, yes, of course.

01:13:54.022 --> 01:13:56.022
The Ronster.

01:13:56.024 --> 01:13:57.893
I'm just gonna run to the loo.

01:13:57.993 --> 01:13:59.695
Uh, I've got to freshen up.

01:13:59.795 --> 01:14:03.110
All right, hurry up and comb your hair.

01:14:07.953 --> 01:14:10.939
I want this interview
over so I can zip outta here.

01:14:11.039 --> 01:14:14.109
I think you have to wait to be called.

01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:15.611
Why so glum, chum?

01:14:15.711 --> 01:14:16.412
Nothing.

01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:18.914
I've been stood up, I think.

01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:20.015
No, no, no.

01:14:20.115 --> 01:14:22.115
I'm sure you haven't.

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:23.852
I'm certain of it. You know...

01:14:23.952 --> 01:14:25.988
She's probably just
running behind schedule.

01:14:26.088 --> 01:14:26.789
Yeah.

01:14:26.889 --> 01:14:27.656
I'm sure he's...

01:14:27.756 --> 01:14:29.876
I'm sure you're right.

01:14:29.976 --> 01:14:32.728
Um, you know, excuse me.

01:14:32.828 --> 01:14:36.313
I gotta... I gotta take this.
I'll be back.

01:14:39.051 --> 01:14:39.868
Come on, Kate.

01:14:39.968 --> 01:14:44.673
You haven't lost your prized
show dog already have you, Lee?

01:14:44.773 --> 01:14:46.675
You should keep him on a short leash.

01:14:46.775 --> 01:14:49.155
Colin, you annoy me. Go away.

01:14:51.064 --> 01:14:52.948
I was afraid you changed your mind.

01:14:53.048 --> 01:14:56.051
No, just my dress...
about 50 billion times.

01:14:56.151 --> 01:14:56.885
Nate.

01:14:56.985 --> 01:14:57.619
Gotta go.

01:14:57.719 --> 01:14:58.921
Ganymede.

01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:01.123
Oh, Mr. Frost.

01:15:01.223 --> 01:15:02.925
Colin, please.

01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:05.027
I am a big fan of your work.

01:15:05.127 --> 01:15:07.337
Wish I could say the same.

01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:11.867
Look who's getting
cozy with the enemy.

01:15:11.967 --> 01:15:13.635
Aren't you a little glass of sass?

01:15:13.735 --> 01:15:15.053
Ho, ho, ho.

01:15:15.153 --> 01:15:18.540
Are you worried your
prize designer will jump ship?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.042
Don't worry, Ron.

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:22.044
I won't make the same mistake you did...

01:15:22.144 --> 01:15:24.947
by letting talent
slip through my fingers.

01:15:25.047 --> 01:15:28.617
I've never heard of
him before your runner.

01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:31.235
Nate didn't work at Zoom?

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:34.138
Did he say that he did?

01:15:36.909 --> 01:15:38.927
I'll call HR.

01:15:39.027 --> 01:15:42.030
Why don't you come work for me?

01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:43.031
You're young.

01:15:43.131 --> 01:15:44.766
You should be with a winner.

01:15:44.866 --> 01:15:47.970
I prefer to work somewhere
with a little bit of legacy.

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.087
Nothing lasts forever.

01:15:54.127 --> 01:15:55.911
Glare away.

01:15:56.011 --> 01:15:58.011
Okay.

01:16:03.035 --> 01:16:05.035
Ha, ha, huh.

01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:29.759
Ugh.

01:17:03.061 --> 01:17:04.046
Hi.

01:17:04.146 --> 01:17:06.031
Wow.

01:17:06.131 --> 01:17:08.341
I'm sorry that I was late.

01:17:09.034 --> 01:17:09.918
It's okay.

01:17:10.018 --> 01:17:14.256
Um, I want to dance with you.

01:17:14.356 --> 01:17:16.356
Okay.

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:19.811
So formal.

01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:22.947
Trying.

01:17:41.066 --> 01:17:43.066
Look at you.

01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.920
Barely recognize you.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020
You're all coordinated.

01:17:47.022 --> 01:17:49.022
Shut up.

01:17:49.274 --> 01:17:50.792
You're not so bad.

01:17:50.892 --> 01:17:51.693
Mm hmm.

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.145
Hmm.

01:17:53.245 --> 01:17:55.263
Excuse me.

01:17:55.363 --> 01:17:57.363
Kate?

01:17:57.983 --> 01:18:01.383
What... I didn't expect to see you here.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.306
I'm with Daniel.

01:18:04.406 --> 01:18:05.974
Oh.

01:18:06.074 --> 01:18:08.074
Yes. Hello, Daniel.

01:18:08.994 --> 01:18:13.215
Ah well, uh, Daniel
have you seen Nate?

01:18:13.315 --> 01:18:14.249
Uh, yeah.

01:18:14.349 --> 01:18:16.349
He's around somewhere.

01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:19.221
Uh, he's got a very
important press interview.

01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:21.446
I can't seem to find him.

01:18:21.807 --> 01:18:28.045
Anyway... well,
enjoy yourselves.

01:18:31.883 --> 01:18:33.368
Uh, will you excuse me for a second?

01:18:33.468 --> 01:18:34.369
You okay?

01:18:34.469 --> 01:18:35.804
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

01:18:35.904 --> 01:18:38.199
I'll be back in one minute.

01:19:01.913 --> 01:19:03.913
Hello.

01:19:04.015 --> 01:19:07.330
Oh, you're going to
mess up my lipstick.

01:19:07.886 --> 01:19:09.604
Are you always this pushy?

01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:12.849
Only when I want
something this badly.

01:19:12.941 --> 01:19:17.345
How would you like
Nate's entire fall line?

01:19:17.445 --> 01:19:20.030
Oh, you wicked, wicked girl.

01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:24.386
I think it's a good time
to finalize deal points.

01:19:24.486 --> 01:19:26.288
You'll have papers ready for Kassell.

01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:27.122
Mm hmm.

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:28.824
And for me as...

01:19:28.924 --> 01:19:31.899
Full partner in every sense.

01:19:31.943 --> 01:19:33.943
And my daughters?

01:19:33.995 --> 01:19:35.995
Huh, fine.

01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:37.199
You have to bring Nate with you.

01:19:37.299 --> 01:19:38.100
Mm.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.430
Well, I can't promise that he'll come.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.530
Where else is he gonna go?

01:19:47.894 --> 01:19:49.894
What was that?

01:19:52.097 --> 01:19:54.298
Hello?

01:20:08.046 --> 01:20:10.046
Hmm.

01:20:11.516 --> 01:20:14.336
Something must have tipped.

01:20:14.436 --> 01:20:15.203
Let's go.

01:20:15.303 --> 01:20:15.971
All right.

01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:17.205
You go first.

01:20:17.305 --> 01:20:19.305
Go on.

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:30.333
I knew it.

01:20:32.138 --> 01:20:33.238
Lee.

01:20:33.338 --> 01:20:35.338
Lee, come here.

01:20:37.209 --> 01:20:39.027
I think you are right
to worry about Nate.

01:20:39.127 --> 01:20:41.263
Just got off the
phone with Angela at Dior.

01:20:41.363 --> 01:20:42.330
Never heard of him.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.901
Yes and then Stan called me back.

01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:47.122
He's not registered with us.

01:20:47.202 --> 01:20:48.970
There's no personal information.

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:50.372
We're not even paying him.

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:52.107
How can this be?

01:20:52.207 --> 01:20:53.975
I told you no to...

01:20:54.075 --> 01:20:54.843
I've been thinking.

01:20:54.943 --> 01:20:57.979
This Nate Ganymede is a real find.

01:20:58.079 --> 01:20:59.281
Where did he come from?

01:20:59.381 --> 01:21:01.266
I don't know.

01:21:01.366 --> 01:21:05.020
Well, his new fall line
up is absolutely stunning.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.255
How do you know
about the fall line-up?

01:21:07.355 --> 01:21:09.355
Oops.

01:21:11.043 --> 01:21:12.327
Oh, honey.

01:21:12.427 --> 01:21:14.262
I'm so sorry.

01:21:14.362 --> 01:21:15.997
That little bastard.

01:21:16.097 --> 01:21:18.097
Nate.

01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:20.435
Lee. I have to tell you something.

01:21:20.535 --> 01:21:21.970
Too late. I know everything.

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:24.005
I need to speak with you in private.

01:21:24.105 --> 01:21:26.508
I know that you lied about your training.

01:21:26.608 --> 01:21:29.044
I know that you lied
about your experience.

01:21:29.144 --> 01:21:30.478
There is no Nate Ganymede.

01:21:30.578 --> 01:21:32.147
None of that matters anymore.

01:21:32.247 --> 01:21:33.548
It doesn't matter?

01:21:33.648 --> 01:21:37.285
You've been working for
Colin Frost all along.

01:21:37.385 --> 01:21:40.021
She's the one conspiring with Colin.

01:21:40.121 --> 01:21:41.089
That is your defense?

01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.957
Stop. Stop.

01:21:42.057 --> 01:21:43.425
Both of you stop.

01:21:43.525 --> 01:21:46.461
We're taking Colin's offer.
Enough.

01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:48.163
You cannot sell Kassell.

01:21:48.263 --> 01:21:50.298
He has our fall line.

01:21:50.398 --> 01:21:52.398
Kassell's finished.

01:21:53.285 --> 01:21:56.304
You, you're quite the actor.

01:21:56.404 --> 01:21:59.374
You had me believing that
Kassell could be great again.

01:21:59.474 --> 01:22:02.126
Oh, honey... I am so sorry.

01:22:43.335 --> 01:22:45.545
Oh no you don't, boyfriend.

01:22:46.504 --> 01:22:48.504
Sorry.

01:23:07.593 --> 01:23:09.593
Ah.

01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:12.529
Ow.

01:23:13.598 --> 01:23:15.598
Kate.

01:23:19.438 --> 01:23:21.438
Kate?

01:23:26.645 --> 01:23:28.645
Kate.

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:04.313
Hey.

01:24:05.517 --> 01:24:07.751
What's wrong, sweetheart?

01:24:12.424 --> 01:24:14.576
They're showing my line.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:16.578
The one you saw Elise give to Colin...

01:24:16.678 --> 01:24:19.597
last night in the storage room.

01:24:19.697 --> 01:24:21.697
Damn.

01:24:23.368 --> 01:24:25.369
Bloody, thieving spies.

01:24:28.374 --> 01:24:30.374
Oh my God.

01:24:30.809 --> 01:24:32.809
Spies.

01:24:34.679 --> 01:24:36.331
Spyware.

01:24:36.431 --> 01:24:38.431
Yes, they're spies.

01:24:47.725 --> 01:24:49.244
Kassell Clothing.

01:24:49.344 --> 01:24:51.146
For not much longer.
Maurice speaking.

01:24:51.246 --> 01:24:51.846
Yes.

01:24:51.946 --> 01:24:52.580
Hello, Maurice.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.680
It's Nate.

01:24:55.568 --> 01:24:57.285
I need your help with something.

01:24:57.385 --> 01:25:00.870
Security is just
insane around here today.

01:25:01.439 --> 01:25:03.208
Right.

01:25:03.308 --> 01:25:04.659
After The Ball.

01:25:04.759 --> 01:25:05.593
Okay.

01:25:05.693 --> 01:25:07.711
I'm on my way.

01:25:17.822 --> 01:25:18.773
Where's the computer?

01:25:18.873 --> 01:25:20.408
It's just in the back.

01:25:20.508 --> 01:25:24.212
Um, I didn't see you leave last night.

01:25:24.312 --> 01:25:28.616
I love the grand entrances but
I prefer to slip out unnoticed.

01:25:28.716 --> 01:25:30.685
Um, I need your help with something.

01:25:30.785 --> 01:25:32.865
Y'know, Daniel. I'm kinda
in the middle of something.

01:25:32.887 --> 01:25:34.422
It won't take a moment.

01:25:34.522 --> 01:25:35.723
Please sit.

01:25:35.823 --> 01:25:36.424
Maybe I...

01:25:36.524 --> 01:25:38.243
Sit down.

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:40.428
I'm experimenting with
the feeling of a shoe.

01:25:40.528 --> 01:25:41.796
So don't look, okay?

01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:42.730
All right.

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:43.498
All right.

01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:44.599
I won't look.

01:25:44.699 --> 01:25:46.301
I don't want you influenced by...

01:25:46.401 --> 01:25:49.716
how you think it's going to feel.

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:02.865
Perfect fit.

01:26:02.901 --> 01:26:04.901
Stand up.

01:26:07.372 --> 01:26:09.372
How does it feel?

01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:12.727
Uh, a little tight in the toe perhaps.

01:26:12.827 --> 01:26:16.664
Good for a night out but
not a hike in the woods.

01:26:16.764 --> 01:26:18.764
Precisely.

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:28.309
I... I, you know I haven't shaved and...

01:26:28.409 --> 01:26:34.498
I thought you were into
girls... one particular...

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:39.735
Kate.

01:26:40.605 --> 01:26:42.605
Hi.

01:26:49.581 --> 01:26:50.899
What the...?

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.999
Daniel?

01:26:57.422 --> 01:26:58.673
Hmm.

01:26:58.773 --> 01:27:00.608
That's ridiculous.

01:27:00.708 --> 01:27:01.609
No, Maurice.

01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:03.709
It's Kate.

01:27:03.795 --> 01:27:05.795
It's Kate.

01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:08.931
Kate?

01:27:09.734 --> 01:27:11.734
You know,

01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:14.856
you're the first woman
I've been attracted to...

01:27:14.956 --> 01:27:16.791
since Hilary Swank.

01:27:16.891 --> 01:27:19.160
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:19.894
Hey.

01:27:19.994 --> 01:27:20.762
Oh.

01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:21.829
Here we are.

01:27:21.929 --> 01:27:23.929
Last night.

01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:27.650
Elise.

01:27:31.924 --> 01:27:33.591
Ow.

01:27:33.691 --> 01:27:35.901
I don't see anyone. Do you?

01:27:36.995 --> 01:27:37.879
Yeah.

01:27:37.979 --> 01:27:39.979
The two of us.

01:27:40.965 --> 01:27:43.005
This changes everything.

01:27:43.017 --> 01:27:45.920
Lee has to see this before he
signs the merger papers today.

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:46.955
In half an hour.

01:27:47.055 --> 01:27:48.423
Let's go show him right now.

01:27:48.523 --> 01:27:49.224
Wait.

01:27:49.324 --> 01:27:50.425
He won't talk to Nate.

01:27:50.525 --> 01:27:52.560
Yeah but this is important.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.896
What would I say? I mean,
he doesn't believe me.

01:27:54.996 --> 01:27:56.431
Either one of me.

01:27:56.531 --> 01:27:58.433
Just because you
assumed a fake identity...

01:27:58.533 --> 01:27:59.968
and have been living a double life?

01:28:00.068 --> 01:28:01.803
Put the video online and call him.

01:28:01.903 --> 01:28:04.572
How will we know that
he's actually seen it?

01:28:04.672 --> 01:28:07.442
No, we need to
physically show it to him.

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:09.444
He needs to know
that Elise is the reason why...

01:28:09.544 --> 01:28:11.512
my designs were
leaked and it wasn't Nate.

01:28:11.612 --> 01:28:13.612
I mean me.

01:28:14.432 --> 01:28:17.852
Except those weren't your designs.

01:28:17.952 --> 01:28:19.954
Maurice, I saw Elise hand over a drive.

01:28:20.054 --> 01:28:22.757
Frost Apparel is doing the
preview at the press conference.

01:28:22.857 --> 01:28:25.860
No one's touched your work.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.713
They have the decoy; Alien Chic.

01:28:30.949 --> 01:28:32.834
Genius.

01:28:32.934 --> 01:28:34.934
I know.

01:28:40.325 --> 01:28:41.075
Yes, hi.

01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:42.810
It's Nate Ganymede speaking.

01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:45.013
Nate, this is Tannis.

01:28:45.113 --> 01:28:48.016
I am calling to tell you that
Lee is selling the company.

01:28:48.116 --> 01:28:50.785
I doubt that's why you're
actually calling me...

01:28:50.885 --> 01:28:55.475
and I'm kind of in the
middle of something, girls.

01:28:56.542 --> 01:28:57.625
Hello, Nate.

01:28:57.725 --> 01:28:59.725
Hello, Kate.

01:29:00.912 --> 01:29:05.633
Huh, I have to admit I
never imagined you two...

01:29:05.733 --> 01:29:06.901
would be the ones to figure this out.

01:29:07.001 --> 01:29:09.381
Well, we did and you aren't.

01:29:10.955 --> 01:29:12.407
Right.

01:29:12.507 --> 01:29:13.875
Well, good for you.

01:29:13.975 --> 01:29:15.009
I'm actually...

01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:17.045
Don't you want to
know what we want?

01:29:17.145 --> 01:29:17.912
Want?

01:29:18.012 --> 01:29:19.781
To stop us revealing to Lee...

01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:23.451
that his daughter is actually a boy.

01:29:23.968 --> 01:29:27.855
Uh, okay, yeah sure.

01:29:27.955 --> 01:29:29.957
What do you want?

01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:34.529
Well, Nate has to ensure that we
become head designers at Frost.

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:38.666
By turning down the job
when Colin offers it to you.

01:29:38.766 --> 01:29:39.867
Publicly.

01:29:39.967 --> 01:29:41.536
At the press conference.

01:29:41.636 --> 01:29:45.773
Yeah and recommending us and
saying that we're awesome.

01:29:45.873 --> 01:29:46.974
Yeah, cause we are.

01:29:47.074 --> 01:29:50.927
Nate can't get into
the press conference.

01:29:52.597 --> 01:29:53.481
Don't worry.

01:29:53.581 --> 01:29:55.581
We can get you in.

01:30:02.073 --> 01:30:03.858
Did you make samples of Alien Chic?

01:30:03.958 --> 01:30:04.559
Yes.

01:30:04.659 --> 01:30:07.110
It keeps me up at night.

01:30:10.015 --> 01:30:14.669
To get the fall line designs
for the press conference.

01:30:14.769 --> 01:30:16.769
Let's go.

01:30:30.936 --> 01:30:32.587
You gonna change into Nate?

01:30:32.687 --> 01:30:33.921
Or do you need a phonebook?

01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:35.089
It's a phone-phone booth.

01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:37.189
I need Maurice.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:51.020
Finally.

01:30:51.689 --> 01:30:52.874
All right. I'll be quick.

01:30:52.974 --> 01:30:54.742
I'm getting pretty good at this.

01:30:54.842 --> 01:30:56.544
Wait. What are those?

01:30:56.644 --> 01:30:59.194
It's Nate's fall line designs.

01:31:00.198 --> 01:31:02.016
There are samples?

01:31:02.116 --> 01:31:04.116
Just two.

01:31:04.802 --> 01:31:06.754
I've gotta be quick to
make the announcement.

01:31:06.854 --> 01:31:07.488
No, no, no.

01:31:07.588 --> 01:31:09.883
You're not gonna wear them.

01:31:11.342 --> 01:31:12.627
We should wear them.

01:31:12.727 --> 01:31:13.628
We should wear them.

01:31:13.728 --> 01:31:14.796
We're gonna wear those.

01:31:14.896 --> 01:31:15.930
Why would you wear those?

01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:19.634
Don't try and trick us
and take all the credit, Kate.

01:31:19.734 --> 01:31:21.774
We're smarter than that.

01:31:21.869 --> 01:31:22.904
Give those to me.

01:31:23.004 --> 01:31:23.771
Excuse me.

01:31:23.871 --> 01:31:24.939
We will wear them.

01:31:25.039 --> 01:31:27.039
Okay.

01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:32.980
Shh.

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.916
Help me. Help me.

01:31:35.016 --> 01:31:36.818
Okay, here.

01:31:36.918 --> 01:31:41.253
The fourth largest apparel
concern in North America.

01:31:45.143 --> 01:31:48.796
I'd now like to invite Lee
Kassell to say a few words.

01:31:48.896 --> 01:31:50.896
Mmm.

01:31:52.718 --> 01:31:58.188
Yeah. How many? 'Kay, coming.

01:32:01.893 --> 01:32:03.960
I built Kassell to last.

01:32:05.663 --> 01:32:07.024
When my first wife, Amanda died...

01:32:07.114 --> 01:32:08.599
Stop.

01:32:08.699 --> 01:32:09.951
How'd you get in here?

01:32:10.051 --> 01:32:13.087
I need you to know,
Colin, before you sign...

01:32:13.187 --> 01:32:17.607
that I have no intention
of joining you at Frost.

01:32:17.658 --> 01:32:22.096
Furthermore, I
recommend Kassell's power duo,

01:32:22.196 --> 01:32:23.831
Tannis and Simone would be far better...

01:32:23.931 --> 01:32:26.000
to head the Frost design department.

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.100
They are awesome.

01:32:41.033 --> 01:32:44.685
Don't laugh, peasants.

01:32:44.785 --> 01:32:46.995
This is the new fall line.

01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:49.223
That is not the new fall line.

01:32:49.323 --> 01:32:51.759
I dunno what the hell is going on here...

01:32:51.859 --> 01:32:54.262
but that is not the new fall line.

01:32:54.362 --> 01:32:55.029
It isn't?

01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:58.019
It isn't but Elise thought it was.

01:32:58.099 --> 01:32:59.100
Security.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.868
Please escort this man out.

01:33:00.968 --> 01:33:03.153
Maurice, the video.

01:33:03.788 --> 01:33:05.922
Get out of my way.

01:33:09.928 --> 01:33:11.112
Don't. Don't.

01:33:11.212 --> 01:33:12.113
Don't touch me.

01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:14.148
My Colin is gonna
have to have design files...

01:33:14.248 --> 01:33:17.151
if we're gonna get a
jump on production.

01:33:17.251 --> 01:33:18.953
Oh, there it is.

01:33:19.053 --> 01:33:21.053
The early fall line.

01:33:21.806 --> 01:33:23.925
This is even better
than how we got Kate.

01:33:24.025 --> 01:33:26.861
You should really consider bangs.

01:33:26.961 --> 01:33:28.162
It would be really cute.

01:33:28.262 --> 01:33:31.322
This is our ticket to better, girls.

01:33:40.224 --> 01:33:43.709
You would turn me
against my own daughter?

01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:47.364
Lee, no.

01:33:47.965 --> 01:33:49.250
Lee, you misunderstand.

01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:51.135
Just stop.

01:33:51.235 --> 01:33:54.465
You've hurt my dad long enough, Elise.

01:33:55.039 --> 01:33:57.758
Oh my God.

01:33:57.858 --> 01:33:59.876
Is that you, Katie?

01:34:02.246 --> 01:34:05.181
Only my mother called me Katie.

01:34:06.083 --> 01:34:08.184
The name is Kate.

01:34:11.255 --> 01:34:12.990
Ohhh.

01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:14.825
Kate?

01:34:14.925 --> 01:34:16.925
Oh.

01:34:17.395 --> 01:34:19.814
We figured that out already.

01:34:19.914 --> 01:34:21.082
Like a long time ago.

01:34:21.182 --> 01:34:23.250
It all makes sense.

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:27.955
You see, Katie the traitor
came back as Nate the traitor.

01:34:28.055 --> 01:34:28.956
That's-that's what happened.

01:34:29.056 --> 01:34:30.758
I would stop talking unless...

01:34:30.858 --> 01:34:33.227
you want us to play the next video?

01:34:33.327 --> 01:34:38.265
A little number I like to
call 'Storage Room with Colin.'

01:34:38.365 --> 01:34:39.784
What?

01:34:39.884 --> 01:34:41.352
I-I...

01:34:41.452 --> 01:34:43.237
It was me that you heard in there.

01:34:43.337 --> 01:34:45.022
Remember.

01:34:45.122 --> 01:34:48.825
You wicked, wicked girl.

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:54.815
No, it's not true.

01:34:54.915 --> 01:34:55.783
It's not true.

01:34:55.883 --> 01:34:57.351
Maurice, the video.

01:34:57.451 --> 01:34:58.185
Wait.

01:34:58.285 --> 01:35:00.285
Stop.

01:35:03.809 --> 01:35:10.164
I think it's time for these two
gentlemen to escort you out.

01:35:10.264 --> 01:35:11.916
Goodbye.

01:35:12.016 --> 01:35:14.016
You'll regret it.

01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:21.915
I've ordered 10,000
units of that monstrosity.

01:35:21.976 --> 01:35:25.631
Ladies and gentlemen,
Frost's new fall line.

01:35:25.831 --> 01:35:26.747
No.

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:29.050
Go you half-wit,
moronic baboons.

01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:29.884
Go.

01:35:29.984 --> 01:35:31.919
Move, you bobbleheads from hell.

01:35:32.019 --> 01:35:34.019
Just move.

01:35:36.273 --> 01:35:38.273
Kate.

01:35:41.245 --> 01:35:43.245
I'm so sorry.

01:35:43.848 --> 01:35:45.888
Can you ever forgive me?

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.420
I wish Mom were here.

01:35:51.922 --> 01:35:53.922
I think she is.

01:35:55.459 --> 01:35:57.459
I know she is.

01:36:07.872 --> 01:36:09.323
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:09.423 --> 01:36:13.027
I present to you Kassell's fall line.

01:36:13.127 --> 01:36:15.127
'Girls Will Be Boys.'

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:30.460
Bravo. Bravo.

01:36:41.105 --> 01:36:42.356
Maurice, this is Jennifer.

01:36:42.456 --> 01:36:45.793
She's thinking of joining
us here at Kassel.

01:36:45.893 --> 01:36:46.393
Hi.

01:36:46.493 --> 01:36:47.228
Hi.

01:36:47.328 --> 01:36:48.062
Thank you.

01:36:48.162 --> 01:36:50.162
Mm hmm.

01:36:50.981 --> 01:36:56.337
If he ever asks you out dancing,
make sure you pick the club.

01:36:56.437 --> 01:36:58.437
Oh my God.

01:36:59.156 --> 01:37:01.375
Is that Daniel Bergeron?

01:37:01.475 --> 01:37:03.600
His shoes are to die for.

01:37:03.611 --> 01:37:05.611
Not just his shoes.

01:37:06.564 --> 01:37:07.214
Hi.

01:37:07.314 --> 01:37:09.314
Hey.

01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.470
Kate.

01:37:14.471 --> 01:37:16.471
Come see.

01:37:17.742 --> 01:37:18.626
Hey, dad.

01:37:18.726 --> 01:37:21.871
Here's the creator of our new runner.

01:37:24.516 --> 01:37:25.499
Not a runner yet.

01:37:25.599 --> 01:37:27.401
Let's wait until it's in stores.

01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:28.986
No.

01:37:29.086 --> 01:37:30.371
So what do you think?

01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:33.073
Oh, I couldn't say.

01:37:33.173 --> 01:37:36.577
I just say what I
think and regret it later.

01:37:36.677 --> 01:37:38.345
I think it's beautiful.

01:37:38.445 --> 01:37:39.997
And...

01:37:40.097 --> 01:37:43.242
Um, I would maybe add a trim.

01:37:46.537 --> 01:37:47.354
Why not?

01:37:47.454 --> 01:37:48.489
Yeah.

01:37:48.589 --> 01:37:49.490
Yeah, good idea.

01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:50.224
What do you think, Dad?

01:37:50.324 --> 01:37:52.259
We could embellish the waist line.

01:37:52.359 --> 01:37:53.194
Yeah.

01:37:53.294 --> 01:37:55.294
We could embellish...

01:41:23.353 --> 01:41:26.707
Colin, I want you to
know that we will be happy...

01:41:26.807 --> 01:41:30.277
to do whatever it takes
to help Frost recover.

01:41:30.377 --> 01:41:34.032
Oh, I think I found
the perfect job for you.

01:41:39.736 --> 01:41:42.966
This room hasn't been sorted in years.

01:41:43.874 --> 01:41:45.376
Enjoy.
