00:22.333 --> 00:26.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live at the grand opening

00:26.333 --> 00:28.750
of Ishaya Bello's first art exhibition.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.000
Thank you.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.791
Thank you all for coming.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.583
Who would have thought
that the dreams of a young boy…

00:44.666 --> 00:47.166
…from Lagos Island would become this?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.541
I always dreamt of being an artist,
of being Essien,

00:50.208 --> 00:53.041
and I got a chance to work with him
as an apprentice in London,

00:53.125 --> 00:55.708
and, boy, he changed my life.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.166
Thank you, Essien.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.291
-Thank you.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.000
Also I'd like to thank my friends.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.291
Ishaya.

01:02.375 --> 01:03.583
Ishaya, wake up!

01:04.416 --> 01:07.250
You're late for work.
Mum is waiting outside. She's very angry.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.166
Shit.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.708
-Shit, shit, shit!

01:50.291 --> 01:53.000
Ishaya, we are already late.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.083
Will you stop dragging your feet?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.416
Right.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.166
Hello.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.375
Who are you again?

02:35.708 --> 02:37.666
I'm the cleaner, sir.

02:38.583 --> 02:39.750
Madam Patricia's son.

02:40.583 --> 02:41.666
Oh.

02:41.750 --> 02:42.708
Okay.

03:04.583 --> 03:07.291
Sister, fine drawing
for your wall, ma, for your wall.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.000
-I painted it myself, it's original. Ma!
-I don't want.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.708
Mama, do you like paintings?

03:13.791 --> 03:16.250
Mama, painting for your fine wall
in your house.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.541
I painted it by myself, ma.
It's a fine work.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.291
Sir, you can buy this drawing.
I drew it myself.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.875
It's original work from me, sir! Sir!

03:27.416 --> 03:29.416
Sir! Daddy, help me now.

03:36.708 --> 03:39.166
Why are you so eager to sell your art?

03:40.208 --> 03:41.416
I need money quickly.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.666
Money for what?

03:43.791 --> 03:44.750
Ishaya.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.083
What's going on?

03:47.708 --> 03:48.791
Nothing.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.583
Have you got someone pregnant?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.458
You'll get someone pregnant, idiot.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.916
Okay, talk to me, what's going on?

03:59.416 --> 04:00.666
Tell me.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.083
You know that…

04:07.541 --> 04:08.958
That artist from London?

04:09.041 --> 04:10.666
Essien, your role model.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.208
Essien. He has this art fellowship…

04:15.625 --> 04:18.666
to study with him for six months.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.750
I applied.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.291
You applied?

04:24.458 --> 04:25.333
He picked me.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.000
-Yeah?
-I swear.

04:29.416 --> 04:30.958
He actually picked me.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.416
Don't lie.
Let me see your face. You're lying.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.583
Why would I lie?

04:36.291 --> 04:38.750
I said he picked… Come see the video.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.083
No way.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.458
<i>Dear Ishaya,</i>
<i>if you're watching this video…</i>

04:42.541 --> 04:43.416
Look.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.250
<i>…then congratulations.</i>

04:45.333 --> 04:48.791
<i>You have been selected</i>
<i>as one of my apprentices in London.</i>

04:48.875 --> 04:51.250
<i>You'll get the required training,</i>
<i>expertise,</i>

04:51.333 --> 04:54.166
and exposure to start your career

04:54.250 --> 04:55.666
on the global stage.

04:56.916 --> 05:00.041
Wow, my guy, you did it!

05:00.125 --> 05:02.000
-How come you didn't tell me?
-Shh! Quiet.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.333
-You're traveling to London?
-That's what I'm trying to arrange.

05:05.416 --> 05:09.333
Before you say "Jack Robinson," you'll be
in London sipping tea with the Queen.

05:09.416 --> 05:12.291
Jack Robinson. Jack Robinson.
Am I in London now?

05:12.375 --> 05:14.458
Calm down. You'll go to London.

05:14.541 --> 05:17.916
My clients will buy your artwork.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.291
-Upfront.
-Upfront. Before!

05:21.125 --> 05:24.000
Let me take a bath
and get ready for Rahila's birthday party.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.333
-What?
-Shit, I haven't bought the cake.

05:28.416 --> 05:29.875
-What?
-Shit, shit, shit.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.041
This guy…

05:43.708 --> 05:46.208
-What are you doing here?
-Go and sit down.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.291
Okay?

05:49.458 --> 05:51.166
Rahila, your cake is here.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.958
-Babe!
-Happy birthday!

05:54.041 --> 05:55.750
Hi! Wait till you see what I got.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.708
I bought it for Rahila.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.916
-What is this?
-Come on, Ishaya.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.041
It's trendy.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.500
So she will attract friends.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.208
I don't want these for her,
looks like clothes for a prostitute.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.750
-It's not bad, I like it.
-I know you'll like this. Naughty!

06:10.833 --> 06:13.333
-Thank you.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.708
Good day sir.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.708
Let's play.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.833
All right, come and eat.

06:24.916 --> 06:27.500
Are you OK?
Want to go to the bedroom?

06:28.666 --> 06:30.916
Rahila,
your dream school advert is on.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.541
<i>At Wilmer Academy,</i>

06:32.625 --> 06:35.541
<i>we are all about giving back</i>
<i>to the society that raised us.</i>

06:35.625 --> 06:40.166
<i>Do you want to win a scholarship</i>
<i>to the most prestigious School in Nigeria?</i>

06:40.250 --> 06:44.833
<i>For those of you who want to come</i>
<i>to Wilmer Academy, here's your chance.</i>

06:44.916 --> 06:49.458
<i>Come to the Wilmer Academy Open Day</i>
<i>and register for the scholarship exam,</i>

06:49.541 --> 06:51.750
<i>and maybe you'll be the--</i>

06:52.375 --> 06:54.166
Hey, now, Mummy, I was watching it!

06:54.250 --> 06:57.958
Don't waste your time.
Attending that school is a futile dream.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.458
You hear me?

07:05.416 --> 07:08.416
My dear daughter,
today's your birthday, hmm?

07:08.500 --> 07:09.333
Let's be merry.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.666
Did you hear? Don't frown.

07:12.583 --> 07:13.583
Go and eat.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.916
Birthday girl.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.666
Smile. That looks…

07:42.416 --> 07:43.375
Thank you.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.458
You know
I can't draw your dream every day.

07:47.541 --> 07:49.791
Chase it now
so you don't regret it later.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.833
My dreams are too expensive.
Plus, I don't even think I belong there.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.083
Unrealistic dreams are destructive.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.208
-Know what I think?
-What?

08:00.291 --> 08:02.208
Tomorrow is their Open Day,
right?

08:03.291 --> 08:04.708
-Go there.
-Hmm?

08:04.791 --> 08:07.666
Register for the scholarship exam.
I mean, you never know.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.916
Mmm-mmm.

08:11.916 --> 08:12.916
Shame.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.958
Will you follow me?

08:15.041 --> 08:16.583
I'm busy, please.

08:16.666 --> 08:17.875
Please, now.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.666
Look, I'm too busy following
my own dreams.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.791
Did you hear?

08:23.750 --> 08:25.750
Okay, I'll follow you.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.083
Don't you have a shirt?
Why are you wearing that shirt?

08:32.583 --> 08:33.416
Tsk.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.791
Are you now
ashamed of where Lagos Island?

08:35.875 --> 08:37.166
Let's go.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.583
Please leave me alone.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.708
-Lala!

09:18.125 --> 09:21.375
Gutter trash
who've never seen wealth before.

09:22.666 --> 09:25.291
Riff-raff. Drive on.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.291
Just look at them. Rubbish.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.333
Didn't I tell you
not to wear this shirt?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.000
Welcome.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.916
I'd like to sign up
for the scholarship exam.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.541
Fill this form.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.416
Pay the registration fee of 150,000 naira.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.875
150,000?

10:01.958 --> 10:02.916
For a scholarship exam?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.833
The entry exam is not free.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.041
But it is a scholarship.

10:07.125 --> 10:10.333
Don't you want to give it to someone
that can't actually afford to pay?

10:10.416 --> 10:14.500
Can she write the exam now and pay for it
later when she gets the scholarship?

10:14.583 --> 10:16.708
This is Wilmer Academy…

10:16.791 --> 10:18.708
…not Lagos Island
Secondary School.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.750
It's fine, Lala. Let's go.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.416
Let's go.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.333
You look absolutely ravishing.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.625
Your smile lights up the entire room.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.708
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

10:44.666 --> 10:46.375
Dreaming is destructive.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.333
My dreams are unrealistic.

10:48.416 --> 10:50.208
Lala, that doesn't
even make sense.

10:50.291 --> 10:51.958
No, look at Daddy.

10:52.041 --> 10:55.791
Dad wanting to be
a famous artist lost us our brother.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.875
Now he's in pain every time.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.416
Maybe Daddy
will actually stop being in pain

11:01.500 --> 11:04.208
if he starts doing what he loves,
just painting.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.875
That's why, me, I'm chasing my dream.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.083
Lala, just because
you can't get into Wilmer

11:16.166 --> 11:19.958
doesn't mean you can't be the neuro…

11:20.041 --> 11:22.125
whatever doctor you decide you want to be.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.041
Wilmer is not the only school in Lagos.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.083
It's neurosurgeon.

11:26.666 --> 11:28.541
You shut up your dirty mouth.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.375
Go, go, go!

12:58.625 --> 12:59.750
What did he do?

13:02.208 --> 13:03.916
He broke my number-one rule.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.375
Got high on my supply.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.916
That's a serious offense.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.208
Baido, feed him to Angel.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.625
Baido, feed him to Angel.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.583
Joe.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.083
Sir, um…

13:32.166 --> 13:34.833
The weed is selling, but…

13:37.083 --> 13:39.541
this medicine is not.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.000
Molly or ecstasy, Joe.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.166
You need to know the name.

13:43.250 --> 13:47.083
Ijoba, Rush is our business.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.666
Why are you selling pills?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.125
We need to diversify.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.833
This will attract rich young people.

13:54.916 --> 13:57.166
You and I
know this business is not new.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.916
I will continue
to develop new markets.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.041
You're losing your mind,
Government.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.083
Sell the pills, Joe,
or don't come back.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.500
What?

14:15.250 --> 14:16.666
My salary, sir.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.416
<i>He's still in pain.</i>

14:21.500 --> 14:22.791
<i>Bring him in.</i>

14:22.875 --> 14:25.583
<i>But you have</i>
<i>to pay your bills before we treat him.</i>

14:25.666 --> 14:27.000
Oh, no.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.500
Pick up, now.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.166
Sorry about your dad.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.416
Daddy! Mummy! Lala!

15:10.208 --> 15:11.125
Lala.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.000
It's still the same pain,

15:15.083 --> 15:18.708
but it was worse this time around,
so we had to rush him to the hospital.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.125
Why didn't you call me?

15:26.208 --> 15:27.875
You didn't pick up.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.791
How much
do we owe the hospital now?

15:31.958 --> 15:32.833
Speak up.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
Ha.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.666
Ishaya…

15:46.041 --> 15:48.125
The medicine they said
we should buy for your father,

15:48.791 --> 15:50.250
that we couldn't afford…

15:50.333 --> 15:51.750
I've bought them.

15:51.833 --> 15:55.250
And the remaining money,
we'll use it for our house rent.

15:56.041 --> 15:59.125
Mummy, please give me back my money.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.208
Mummy, this is the money
for the apprenticeship in London.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.833
The money I need to use to travel.

16:03.916 --> 16:06.625
Mummy, please, just give me
back the rest of my money. Please.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.708
Ishaya, you are wicked.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.708
With all we are going through
in this family,

16:11.791 --> 16:13.666
-you want to travel?
-Please.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.208
-To where?
-London.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.083
To do what? Draw?

16:17.666 --> 16:19.041
The devil's work!

16:19.125 --> 16:21.708
Isn't it the same evil money
you are using to treat him?

16:21.791 --> 16:24.291
-Give me my money.
-How dare you talk that way!

16:24.375 --> 16:25.666
Give back my money!

16:27.166 --> 16:28.291
Take it easy.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.916
It's for three months now!
Just three months!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.500
Get out of my sight.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.916
Lala, you did this to me?

16:41.666 --> 16:43.375
Why did the ambulance come?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.291
Who's that?
How are you, Adufe?

17:03.375 --> 17:04.916
I'm fine, how are you?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.416
Rahila told me what happened.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.791
I'm sorry.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.375
How would you go about it?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.583
I will go to London.

17:26.333 --> 17:29.541
London? Osapa London in Lekki?

17:31.625 --> 17:35.083
My guy, you must be kidding.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.875
You neither have a passport nor visa…

17:37.958 --> 17:40.041
And you don't even have enough
for the ticket yet.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.041
I'll find a way.

17:45.083 --> 17:49.166
I'm not going to end up like my father,
sad because I have forsaken my dreams.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.208
Look at Essien.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.916
He saw my work, liked it, and chose me.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.333
Ishaya…

17:57.833 --> 18:00.333
You're planning to leave the country
and didn't tell me?

18:02.833 --> 18:03.833
Ugh.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.416
I thought we would get married.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.875
-I can't marry anybody like this.
-"Anybody"?

18:10.416 --> 18:12.333
I have to succeed first.

18:12.416 --> 18:14.083
So I'm anybody?

18:15.083 --> 18:17.541
Babe, that's not what I said.

18:18.416 --> 18:21.000
-I didn't mean it that way.
-Bless you.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.000
Babe…

18:24.500 --> 18:25.541
Adufe…

19:31.541 --> 19:33.666
Oga Rambo wants to see you
in his VIP spot.

19:38.791 --> 19:40.791
Yo, Oluwadollar.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.208
What the king doesn't have…

20:06.250 --> 20:07.708
he wants.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.083
What does the queen want?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.541
Open it.

20:26.416 --> 20:27.416
Are you deaf?

20:29.208 --> 20:30.333
Open it!

20:30.416 --> 20:31.625
Move it.

20:31.708 --> 20:32.958
Yes, sir.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.041
Ishaya, get up.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.708
Time to go to work.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.333
Check out this gold bracelet

21:56.416 --> 22:00.125
and her choke necklace.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.083
Don't choke her too much.

22:04.833 --> 22:08.500
Hey, boy, change some dollars
for me, I need more money, okay?

22:08.583 --> 22:10.375
Check
that place for the money.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.625
Bring me this money.
It'd better be complete.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.083
No sleep for strippers.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.916
Dollar does not depreciate, yeah.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.291
Dollar Boy! Bring me liquor!

22:24.125 --> 22:25.458
<i>Ishaya.</i>

22:26.083 --> 22:27.000
Wait.

22:28.666 --> 22:30.083
What's up?

22:30.666 --> 22:32.166
You and Oga Rambo?

22:32.250 --> 22:35.333
What's wrong with you?
What do you think you're doing?

22:35.416 --> 22:38.708
You don't get to ask me that
after you treated me like that.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.041
-Huh?
-How did I treat you?

22:41.250 --> 22:43.541
See, for your information,

22:43.625 --> 22:47.166
Oga Rambo, he has treated me
better than you ever did, you hear me?

22:47.250 --> 22:49.666
Have you ever asked me
what I want out of life?

22:52.583 --> 22:55.875
You don't think I deserve it, but I do.

22:57.291 --> 22:58.375
Rubbish.

23:00.916 --> 23:02.833
Sir, a customer
wants to change money.

23:02.916 --> 23:04.500
Get ten bundles, put it in that bag.

23:10.125 --> 23:11.666
Nine, ten.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.791
We need
new market for the molly ASAP.

23:16.458 --> 23:20.166
<i>You have been selected</i>
<i>as one of my apprentices in London.</i>

23:20.750 --> 23:23.041
<i>Look, I'm too busy</i>
<i>following my own dreams.</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:41.583
Will it take you a million years
to count ten fucking bundles?

23:41.666 --> 23:43.750
Sorry. Sorry, sir. I'm done.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.750
You're obsessed with music.
All day long, it's music! Why?

24:20.541 --> 24:21.541
Here.

24:23.625 --> 24:24.500
What's this?

24:24.583 --> 24:26.458
Wilmer entrance exam answers.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.500
But, Daddy, I can pass it on my own.

24:29.583 --> 24:31.458
One thing I've always wanted,

24:31.541 --> 24:35.958
to be the managing director
of Five Star Realty,

24:37.208 --> 24:40.625
selling mansions to billionaires.

24:40.708 --> 24:44.166
And you know where those billionaires are?
Wilmer Academy.

24:45.416 --> 24:48.458
I need you to memorize those answers,

24:49.083 --> 24:50.166
get in,

24:50.250 --> 24:52.291
help me get rich.

24:52.375 --> 24:55.375
With a scholarship,
there's no school fees.

24:55.458 --> 24:59.166
And $10,000 award.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.625
So, cram those answers.

25:02.416 --> 25:03.291
Capisce?

25:03.791 --> 25:04.958
Capisce.

25:25.791 --> 25:26.750
Sorry, sir.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.291
Cleaner boy, wait!

25:53.958 --> 25:55.666
I threw something away by mistake.

25:59.333 --> 26:00.208
Open the bag.

26:13.375 --> 26:14.666
What are you looking for now?

26:14.750 --> 26:16.666
Shut up. Don't ask such stupid questions.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.041
-Lala.
-Hmm?

26:49.916 --> 26:53.541
What if I told you I had the answers
to Wilmer entrance exams?

26:53.625 --> 26:56.333
100% guaranteed,
you'd get the scholarship.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.750
I still don't have the money for the test.

26:59.833 --> 27:02.000
What if I told you
I had the money for the test too?

27:02.083 --> 27:03.958
I don't think
I want to go there by cheating.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.541
It only means I don't deserve to be there,
so, no.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.750
You know how much
the top student wins?

27:26.833 --> 27:27.875
How much? A million?

27:27.958 --> 27:29.375
Six million.

27:30.041 --> 27:32.750
Look at you,
I've already registered with 150,000.

27:33.916 --> 27:36.750
Where'd you get the money?
Why are you stealing Rahila's dream?

27:36.833 --> 27:39.500
I asked her, she said
she won't cheat to achieve her dream.

27:39.583 --> 27:42.375
Me,
I'll do anything to get my dream.

27:42.916 --> 27:44.291
Understand?

27:44.375 --> 27:46.500
Here, help me learn the answers.

27:47.083 --> 27:52.083
Number one, B.
Number two, C. Number three…

27:54.708 --> 27:58.041
Thirty-eight, D. Thirty-nine…

27:58.125 --> 27:59.541
Forty-one, C.

28:02.541 --> 28:05.208
You have 90 minutes.
You may begin.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.666
Face forward.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.375
-It's a goal!

29:19.625 --> 29:22.833
My guy!

29:24.666 --> 29:25.583
Get out!

29:32.500 --> 29:35.250
The best education in Africa.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.625
Thank you for choosing Wilmer Academy.

29:40.625 --> 29:41.791
What do you think?

29:42.458 --> 29:43.791
<i>I think that was pretty good.</i>

29:43.875 --> 29:45.041
You're coming, right?

29:46.625 --> 29:49.666
<i>I have to go to church with my mom,</i>
<i>but I'll come over later.</i>

29:49.750 --> 29:50.708
<i>Okay?</i>

29:50.791 --> 29:52.458
<i>-Good luck! Bye!</i>
-Ugh.

30:09.833 --> 30:13.625
<i>The Wilmer Academy</i>
<i>Open Day is a proud tradition</i>

30:13.708 --> 30:15.166
<i>that goes back 20 years,</i>

30:15.250 --> 30:20.541
<i>where our leaders of tomorrow experience</i>
<i>Wilmer for the first time as scholars.</i>

30:21.250 --> 30:24.041
<i>After registration,</i>

30:24.125 --> 30:28.708
<i>please make your way into the auditorium,</i>
<i>where the program will commence.</i>

30:28.791 --> 30:29.625
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:30.625 --> 30:32.416
Excuse me a second.

30:38.625 --> 30:39.791
Ishaya Bello?

30:41.625 --> 30:43.875
I am Principal Gemade.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.500
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

30:48.416 --> 30:50.541
I'll see you after the tour.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.750
Stuffing your face…

31:05.625 --> 31:07.375
Principal Gemade, meet my son.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.250
-Oh!

31:14.333 --> 31:16.000
I'm sorry,

31:16.083 --> 31:17.125
Carmen.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.041
Next time,

31:18.625 --> 31:19.500
don't touch,

31:20.416 --> 31:21.291
Ishaya.

31:24.666 --> 31:26.500
-Mum.
-Where have you been?

31:26.583 --> 31:28.000
-I--
-Here. Your speech.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.500
Just read it like you mean it.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.625
Here.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.791
Smile. Let's go.

31:33.291 --> 31:38.083
And I know this year will be
one of the best years

31:38.166 --> 31:40.291
Wilmer Academy has ever seen.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.916
Without further ado,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.791
I'd like to call on
the great-granddaughter of the founder

31:47.875 --> 31:51.625
to welcome her fellow students
to the new academic year.

31:58.833 --> 31:59.875
Good afternoon.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.750
My name is Carmen Wilmer Willoughby.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.500
-I'm a descendant of the founding father.
-This babe is fine!

32:09.250 --> 32:10.708
Sorry, but I don't see it.

32:10.791 --> 32:13.583
It's an honor to welcome you all
to the new academic session.

32:13.666 --> 32:17.333
And anyone who dates Atlas
is definitely not a good person.

32:18.000 --> 32:18.958
Atlas?

32:19.625 --> 32:21.500
What, like the map of the world?

32:22.333 --> 32:23.333
Thank you.

32:29.416 --> 32:31.958
Now, before the tour,

32:32.791 --> 32:35.833
I'd like to introduce someone special.

32:37.208 --> 32:40.208
This year,
we started a scholarship program,

32:40.291 --> 32:43.083
which is sponsored by Pastor Okolo.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.458
Allow me to introduce

32:47.541 --> 32:51.166
the first recipient
who had a perfect score.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.166
Ishaya Bello.

33:10.541 --> 33:12.791
I can't believe
you're the scholarship student.

33:12.875 --> 33:14.458
I came second in the exam.

33:14.541 --> 33:16.000
We need to talk.

33:16.583 --> 33:19.833
Hey. You want a picture
with the scholarship student, right?

33:19.916 --> 33:21.166
Come back, I'm busy.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.000
-How dare you!

33:24.500 --> 33:26.041
Can I have your attention?

33:28.666 --> 33:29.583
Let's go.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.416
Put this thing
on the wall properly now.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.541
-That's now how you--
-Atlas! Hey, babe.

33:36.625 --> 33:37.625
Hey.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.125
-How are you?
-I'm okay.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.375
-How's the tour going?
-Frustrating.

33:44.458 --> 33:45.833
Guys, this is--

33:45.916 --> 33:47.000
Frankincense!

33:47.791 --> 33:49.625
Is that you I smell?

33:49.708 --> 33:51.750
Atlas, we're too old for this.

33:51.833 --> 33:53.416
Come on, babe.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.833
He clearly missed me.

33:55.416 --> 33:59.041
That's why he followed me
all the way to Wilmer, right?

33:59.125 --> 34:00.625
My name is… I'm Frank.

34:00.708 --> 34:03.833
Yes, but the full thing
is Frankincense, right?

34:03.916 --> 34:05.958
-Frankincense--
-Hey, hey.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.541
Madam Tour Guide,
can we focus on why we're here?

34:08.625 --> 34:10.958
Or is your boyfriend
what we're here to see?

34:12.708 --> 34:13.541
Let's go.

34:14.916 --> 34:18.000
FYI, the name is Carmen.

34:18.708 --> 34:19.958
And it's this way.

34:28.208 --> 34:30.375
Put this thing on the wall properly now.

34:31.416 --> 34:34.291
And this is the brand-new art gallery.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.333
You drew this?

34:49.416 --> 34:51.583
I want to be an artist, Mummy, like Daddy.

34:51.666 --> 34:54.125
But you know
art is forbidden in this house.

34:56.791 --> 34:58.166
Daddy! Daddy!

35:01.125 --> 35:03.625
Let me guess. Artist.

35:03.708 --> 35:05.166
How did you know?

35:05.250 --> 35:08.583
You really need to learn
how not to touch without permission.

35:13.208 --> 35:14.458
This way.

35:31.541 --> 35:34.041
Ma, my $10,000.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.125
Can I get it now?

35:35.916 --> 35:39.291
As soon as we receive your transcript
from your secondary school.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.166
Transcript?

35:41.250 --> 35:43.500
School resumes next week Monday,

35:43.583 --> 35:45.708
so please bring it to us by then.

35:50.458 --> 35:53.333
I thought you were so stupid
you couldn't memorize the answers,

35:53.416 --> 35:54.708
but you're even more stupid,

35:54.791 --> 35:58.375
'cause you threw it away, and now
the cleaner's son got the scholarship.

35:59.541 --> 36:01.666
I wanted to prove
that I could do it on my own.

36:01.750 --> 36:06.583
You are an idiot if you think anyone can
achieve anything honestly in this world!

36:06.666 --> 36:09.083
Get out of my sight!

36:09.166 --> 36:11.791
Get the hell out of my sight.
Nonsense.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.083
Just look at him.

36:15.208 --> 36:16.750
-Hey, Patricia.
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

36:16.833 --> 36:17.708
You are fired!

36:18.250 --> 36:19.541
<i>Sir, please…</i>

36:20.250 --> 36:22.666
Go and ask that thief you call a son.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.875
Bro AB, I know I owe you money.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.958
Please, just let me run this package.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.750
Whatever it is,
my answer is no.

36:34.291 --> 36:37.125
My guy, please,
this is very important.

36:37.208 --> 36:39.750
-I said no!
-Guy, calm down!

36:41.541 --> 36:45.791
Please, it's just this document
I need help with.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.500
Replace her name with mine.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.458
-It'll cost 50K.
-Jesus!

36:59.541 --> 37:00.916
50K is too much for this!

37:03.500 --> 37:04.583
Wait.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.125
<i>I don't have 50K.</i>

37:32.958 --> 37:33.875
Take.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.916
I'm pleading with you,

37:38.416 --> 37:40.333
as soon as you get the scholarship money,

37:40.416 --> 37:42.875
return it,
because it's my office contribution.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.125
-I don't want problems.
-Mike…

37:45.208 --> 37:46.666
I beg you in the name of God.

37:46.750 --> 37:47.708
Thank you.

37:48.458 --> 37:49.750
Thank you.

38:03.125 --> 38:06.875
Mum, this is the tenth time
I'm calling you. Call me back.

38:06.958 --> 38:10.500
I can't apply for the London Art Institute
grant if my school fees aren't paid.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.250
I can't keep living at Reggie's house.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.916
It's like I'm homeless.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.208
Call me back.

38:19.958 --> 38:20.791
No! Ugh!

38:20.875 --> 38:21.958
Baby.

38:23.416 --> 38:26.833
Can you imagine
that useless man named Allen…

38:26.916 --> 38:29.125
-Uh-huh?
-You know, his school

38:29.208 --> 38:32.333
is now participating
in the London Art Institute grant?

38:32.416 --> 38:35.208
-I thought that was exclusive to us.
-Apparently not.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.166
Good morning.

38:39.250 --> 38:43.666
-Oh, Atlas!
-I see you have a new Essien on your wall.

38:43.750 --> 38:47.375
One day very soon, we'll have
an Atlas original when you win the grant.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.041
-Miss Carmen.
-What?

39:03.125 --> 39:05.666
Your friend has come
to carry you to school, so Mummy said--

39:05.750 --> 39:06.958
Tell Mummy to come now!

39:07.541 --> 39:10.125
-You mean I should tell her--
-Tell her to come now!

39:13.333 --> 39:14.791
Uh, excuse me.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.208
Mmm, okay, okay, uh…

39:18.291 --> 39:20.125
-I'll be right back.
-Oh, dear.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.041
So, Atlas, how's your mother?

39:26.125 --> 39:27.125
Uh, she's good.

39:28.125 --> 39:29.250
Good.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.125
What's going on here?

39:37.916 --> 39:38.916
Give it to me!

39:39.000 --> 39:42.208
You don't need any more painkillers.
Only people in pain need it.

39:42.291 --> 39:45.875
Even Dr. Olaoye says you don't need pills.

39:45.958 --> 39:48.916
-It's been a year--
-Neither you nor her shattered your leg!

39:49.000 --> 39:50.041
Enough!

39:51.125 --> 39:54.125
People are watching,
waiting for you to have a breakdown.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.000
You're a Wilmer Willoughby, my daughter.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.000
So chin up and smile!

40:04.541 --> 40:07.333
It feels like
I have no control over my life.

40:07.416 --> 40:09.583
She even took my painkillers.
I don't get it.

40:09.666 --> 40:12.833
Is it her pain? Ugh.
I can't wait to leave this house.

40:12.916 --> 40:15.000
Babe, take it easy.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.125
In two years,

40:16.208 --> 40:20.375
you and I'll be eating caviar
and drinking champagne along the Thames.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.833
Hmm.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.083
Okay.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Thank you.

40:38.041 --> 40:38.875
Hello?

40:38.958 --> 40:41.375
-Mum! Finally! I've been trying to--
-<i>Hello, Atlas.</i>

40:41.458 --> 40:44.333
<i>Your mother is still in Paris.</i>
<i>She'll give you a call later.</i>

40:54.541 --> 40:57.625
-Babe, are you okay? What's wrong?

41:13.458 --> 41:15.625
-Atlas, stop!

41:22.083 --> 41:23.291
I'm sorry.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

41:38.041 --> 41:41.041
I have to get someone
to call your school's records office

41:41.125 --> 41:42.375
to verify this.

41:43.000 --> 41:43.833
Verify?

41:45.750 --> 41:46.625
The thing is,

41:47.250 --> 41:49.375
the school, their phone lines are down.

41:49.458 --> 41:51.666
So they gave me, um, a phone number

41:51.750 --> 41:54.208
that you can call
in case you need to verify.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.791
Sorry. Just write it down for you here.

42:26.416 --> 42:28.875
-This guy. Fuckin' pick up.

42:39.541 --> 42:42.208
If it isn't the royal couple
of Wilmer Academy.

42:42.833 --> 42:45.375
Car, you ready for your
welcome back party this weekend?

42:45.458 --> 42:48.083
Why? Oh, my bad! It was a surprise?

42:48.750 --> 42:49.750
Surprise.

42:51.958 --> 42:54.125
Babe,
I can cancel if it's too much.

42:55.291 --> 42:57.708
No. It's probably what I need.

42:58.333 --> 42:59.458
Yes, Mummy.

42:59.541 --> 43:02.875
May God be with you too
as we accomplish His new mission.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.625
Amen.

43:06.750 --> 43:07.625
Crazy.

43:08.958 --> 43:10.708
Now that we are all gathered together,

43:10.791 --> 43:13.125
I have a very special
"Welcome back to Wilmer"

43:13.208 --> 43:14.666
package just for you, Car.

43:14.750 --> 43:16.958
-Where's that?
-To the shrine?

43:17.041 --> 43:19.208
Mmm, to the shrine!

43:41.500 --> 43:44.000
-Occupied. Fuck off!

43:50.541 --> 43:52.583
Bro, this shit smells different.

43:52.666 --> 43:55.208
Yeah, man, I got the Holy Grail of kush
all for Car's first day.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.208
Step outside, please.

44:05.958 --> 44:06.833
Ma?

44:07.541 --> 44:09.583
My secretary has your uniforms
and schedule.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.500
The transcript?

44:13.583 --> 44:14.458
Verified.

44:19.458 --> 44:22.666
Um, so, my prize money, where is it?

44:22.750 --> 44:24.625
-You mean the grant.
-Yes.

44:24.708 --> 44:27.541
You can collect it at the end of the day
from the bursar.

44:32.708 --> 44:34.666
Oh, thank you.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.125
Car, baby, no.

44:36.708 --> 44:37.875
You should know better.

44:38.541 --> 44:42.958
Good thing secondhand smoking is a thing,
so just breathe in, Car, baby.

44:44.583 --> 44:46.791
-So what's your problem?

44:46.875 --> 44:50.125
If this is about last week,
I told you, I had a church thing.

44:50.208 --> 44:52.750
Nen, this is about the last few months,

44:52.833 --> 44:55.083
and a quick puff-puff-pass
is not going to fix it.

44:55.166 --> 44:57.166
Can you guys please not fuck up my high?

44:57.250 --> 44:58.500
Exactly.

44:58.583 --> 44:59.875
Let's just go to class.

44:59.958 --> 45:01.875
Is that shit because
I'm a year behind now?

45:01.958 --> 45:05.083
Good God, Carmen. Reggie, please,
light one up for this girl.

45:05.166 --> 45:06.583
She needs to chill.

45:06.666 --> 45:09.083
Babe, you think
maybe it's because of the pills?

45:11.041 --> 45:12.083
What pills?

45:36.291 --> 45:37.208
Fuck.

45:37.291 --> 45:38.125
Leave.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.916
-Are you deaf? I said get the--
-Hey, let's go.

45:49.791 --> 45:51.875
Hey, don't be a snitch.

46:01.750 --> 46:02.750
Just for today.

46:03.708 --> 46:05.666
Simile, metaphor…

46:06.291 --> 46:07.458
Can I help you?

46:09.208 --> 46:10.125
Um…

46:10.958 --> 46:12.041
I'm Ishaya Bello.

46:12.125 --> 46:13.291
I'm new.

46:13.833 --> 46:17.375
Everyone is,
and no one else is late, Mr. Scholarship.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.708
Can you get somewhere to sit?

46:26.708 --> 46:28.208
As I was saying,

46:28.291 --> 46:31.041
alliteration, irony.

46:31.666 --> 46:33.250
Who can tell me the ninth one?

46:33.333 --> 46:35.875
I have listed eight out of nine…

47:19.375 --> 47:20.416
Do you like Carmen?

47:21.083 --> 47:22.416
You were drawing her.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.083
Um…

47:27.666 --> 47:28.500
Here.

47:30.750 --> 47:33.875
-For helping me tie my tie.
-Oh, my God.

47:33.958 --> 47:35.500
You drew this in 40 minutes?

47:35.583 --> 47:36.583
Well, 20, actually.

47:38.541 --> 47:39.583
Hi.

47:39.666 --> 47:41.958
I'm Zina. I know you're Ishaya.
And you are?

47:42.041 --> 47:43.041
I'm Denrele.

47:43.125 --> 47:45.375
-I wasn't talking to you.
-Me?

47:46.541 --> 47:48.708
I'm Frank. Frank Abok.

47:48.791 --> 47:50.500
Hi, it's nice to meet you guys.

47:50.583 --> 47:53.666
Today we're going to discuss
the plans for the semester,

47:53.750 --> 47:55.416
so no need for your pencils.

48:09.916 --> 48:12.583
This year we're also doing
something very different

48:12.666 --> 48:14.791
for the London Art Institute grant.

48:14.875 --> 48:18.083
Now, everyone can participate,
but only three students,

48:18.166 --> 48:20.500
one from your year and
two from the second year,

48:20.583 --> 48:24.708
will be submitting
directly to the London Art Institute.

48:24.791 --> 48:28.291
Now, to select the students,
I will be giving you all an assignment.

48:28.375 --> 48:30.250
Deadline is next Thursday.

48:41.625 --> 48:42.625
You're very talented.

48:44.875 --> 48:48.083
I look forward to seeing
your submission for the shortlist.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.291
I don't think I'll be submitting anything.

48:54.458 --> 48:58.083
After removing the cost
of books and uniform,

48:58.166 --> 49:01.125
your balance is now 5,000 naira.

49:03.041 --> 49:04.000
Sir?

49:08.250 --> 49:09.291
Five thousand what?

49:28.416 --> 49:30.250
Michael,
I was given 5,000 naira.

49:33.625 --> 49:35.875
I was given 5,000 naira, what do I do?

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
What do I do?

49:55.833 --> 49:57.166
Jesus.

50:01.083 --> 50:02.416
Don't you know

50:03.125 --> 50:04.833
I'm from the streets?

50:06.625 --> 50:08.250
Rambo's family…

50:14.041 --> 50:15.791
took me in and raised me.

50:17.291 --> 50:18.708
When his mother died,

50:19.833 --> 50:21.416
we were left on our own,

50:22.791 --> 50:24.208
hustling on the streets.

50:27.750 --> 50:32.708
You can ask your father,
who knew us before we started our business

50:32.791 --> 50:34.625
that earned us our respect.

50:39.375 --> 50:40.375
Then you have the…

50:42.458 --> 50:43.416
temerity…

50:46.458 --> 50:49.000
to steal 150,000 naira from us.

50:49.083 --> 50:49.916
Huh?

50:50.000 --> 50:53.458
You think we are so stupid
that we don't have cameras

50:53.541 --> 50:55.041
in the money room?

50:55.625 --> 50:59.333
Brother Government,
Brother Rambo, please, I'll pay you--

51:04.708 --> 51:08.375
Please, I'll pay you back,
I just need a little time.

51:08.458 --> 51:09.625
Please, a little time--

51:09.708 --> 51:11.875
Government,
Angel is hungry.

51:12.458 --> 51:13.625
Let's feed him to her.

51:13.708 --> 51:15.583
-Uh, Kasali--

51:15.666 --> 51:17.083
Don't call me that!

51:18.166 --> 51:19.500
That's not my name.

51:20.375 --> 51:21.750
I'm sorry, Oga Rambo.

51:21.833 --> 51:23.375
Please. I beg you.

51:23.458 --> 51:26.875
I'll pay you back,
I just need just a little time.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.583
Please. Please.

51:28.666 --> 51:30.708
Please. Please, sir. Please.

51:30.791 --> 51:32.000
You have one week.

51:34.083 --> 51:37.208
Or your sister will clear your debt
in our private rooms.

51:37.916 --> 51:41.000
No. No, take me, I'll follow you.

51:41.083 --> 51:42.208
Leave my daughter.

51:42.291 --> 51:45.708
Woman, no man
will pay anything to look at you.

51:48.500 --> 51:51.500
Please, please,
I'll pay the money. I just need time.

51:51.583 --> 51:54.166
We'll pay your
money back, sir, please.

51:54.250 --> 51:56.750
Mummy, don't let them take me! Leave me!

51:56.833 --> 51:59.416
-Leave me! Leave me!
-My daughter! My daughter!

51:59.500 --> 52:02.166
-Please, sir! No, don't take her, please!
-No!

52:02.916 --> 52:05.583
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!
Don't follow them!

52:05.666 --> 52:07.500
-Mummy!
-Don't follow them.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.583
Crazy people,
leave my sight.

52:09.666 --> 52:12.250
I'll pay you back your money.
Mr. Government, please!

52:13.583 --> 52:16.583
You did this… so fix it!

52:17.708 --> 52:19.416
Go look for their money and pay them.

52:20.625 --> 52:23.083
Ishaya,
get out of this house now!
