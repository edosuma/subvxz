00:08.241 --> 00:10.710
 Hey, Mikey, how are you doing?
 How was your weekend?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.746
  Can I borrow $300?

00:12.779 --> 00:15.448
 Fine, great, and not a chance.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.650
 Mikey, do you still have
 those savings bonds?

00:17.684 --> 00:20.120
Okay, Zack, what gives?

00:20.153 --> 00:22.255
 It was all my father's fault.

00:22.288 --> 00:25.091
  He told me not to fool around
  with his new video camera.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.427
   -What happened?
   -I fooled around with it.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.596
   You see, I was on my roof

00:29.629 --> 00:33.500
  taking pictures of the
  Zeffirelli twins doing
  aerobics in their backyard.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.436
 Zach, they live two blocks
 from your house.

00:36.469 --> 00:39.372
It's amazing what they've
done with zoom lenses.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.776
   I started to slip.
   It was either
   me or the camera.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.878
   I think you made
   the wrong choice.

00:44.911 --> 00:46.346
   Come on!

00:47.814 --> 00:49.449
( bell rings )

00:49.482 --> 00:52.318
<i>*  When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:52.352 --> 00:55.321
    <i>*  I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:55.355 --> 00:57.857
<i>*  By the time</i>
<i>I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:57.891 --> 01:01.661
 <i>*  I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

01:01.695 --> 01:05.465
  <i>*  It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:07.534 --> 01:10.470
 <i>*  If the teacher</i>
 <i>pops a test</i>
 <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:10.503 --> 01:13.540
   <i>*  And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:16.476
  <i>*  Ridin' low in my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:20.146
   <i>* If I can hand it</i>
   <i>in tomorrow</i>
   <i>it'll be all right</i>

01:20.180 --> 01:23.783
  <i>*  It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:38.231 --> 01:41.234
   <i>*  It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:44.237
   <i>*  It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:44.270 --> 01:48.141
   <i>*  It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.649
  Miss Bliss:
 <i>The Computer Age is upon us.</i>

01:56.683 --> 02:01.287
  <i>You can bank,</i>
  <i>shop, even invest</i>
  <i>without ever leaving home.</i>

02:01.321 --> 02:05.859
   <i>Each year,</i>
   <i>my students chip in $2</i>
   <i>and we buy stock.</i>

02:05.892 --> 02:07.594
  <i>While they're busy</i>
  <i>dreaming of riches,</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:12.365
   <i>they have no idea</i>
   <i>I'm teaching them</i>
   <i>about American business.</i>

02:12.399 --> 02:13.833
  <i>Pretty sneaky, huh?</i>

02:14.367 --> 02:15.468
 Okay.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.775
  Can anybody tell me
  about the Great Depression?

02:21.808 --> 02:26.479
 That's what happens when your
 mother cuts off your
 phone privileges.

02:26.513 --> 02:31.217
  Well, actually,
  I was referring to
  the crash of 1929.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.318
 I knew that.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.187
Before we're
completely bummed out,

02:34.220 --> 02:36.589
 can we check your
 brokerage account
 and see how our stock's doing?

02:36.623 --> 02:38.825
 Sure.
 Mikey, fire up the computer.

02:38.858 --> 02:42.862
   Why bother?
   Elliot Airlines hasn't
   budged since Elliot died.

02:44.464 --> 02:48.535
Let's get our 50 bucks back
before they bury
his plane, too.

02:48.568 --> 02:51.404
 I knew we should have
 invested in stealth bombers.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.507
There is big
money in invisibility.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.811
 Now, if you'd all
 read this morning's newspaper

02:57.844 --> 02:59.713
   as you were supposed to,

02:59.746 --> 03:02.716
   you would've read
   some very exciting news.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.151
 Purple is the new fall color.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.688
 I'm referring to the merger.

03:08.722 --> 03:13.360
 Trans Universal Air
 has swallowed up your airline.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.794
   Hey, guys, look at this.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.932
 Trans Universal Air
 has gone up
 three bucks a share.

03:18.965 --> 03:21.301
 Can someone tell me
 how much we've made?

03:21.334 --> 03:24.371
   That's $150. We're rich!

03:24.404 --> 03:25.438
Right.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.606
   Get real.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.843
 We're comfortable,
 but not rich.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.881
 One hundred and
 fifty dollars overnight.
 This could have possibilities.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.450
 Maybe we should sell
 and take our profits.

03:37.484 --> 03:41.388
Well, when you invest
on the stock market,
there are always risks.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.823
   You can make money,
   but you can also lose it.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.326
  So what do you wanna do?
  Do you wanna
  stay in or get out?

03:46.359 --> 03:48.328
  -We'll stay in.
  -We'll stay in. Go for it.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.563
   Alright, let's go for it.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.298
  Is there some way
  I can do some more studying

03:52.332 --> 03:54.367
  on these mergers and
  acquisitions thing?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.703
  Well, you can always
  do research at the library.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.738
   Great! Good idea.

03:58.772 --> 04:02.442
 Miss Bliss,
 exactly where is the library?

04:06.379 --> 04:10.684
   Only four more days
   until they deliver
   your hot new convertible.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.919
What's the first
thing you're gonna do?

04:12.952 --> 04:15.355
 Burn rubber in a school zone.

04:17.891 --> 04:22.562
  Miss Bliss,
  I hate to tell you this
  but my men are complaining.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.564
   That old clunker of yours

04:24.597 --> 04:27.367
   just dripped
   another quart of oil
   all over the parking lot.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.803
   Mylo, it's a parking lot.

04:29.836 --> 04:34.974
 To you it's a parking lot.
 To me it's asphalt sculpture.

04:35.075 --> 04:39.512
   And a very lovely one, Mylo.
   I promise it
   won't happen again.

04:39.546 --> 04:43.516
  Good, because
  woodshop's having trouble
  turning out enough sawdust.

04:44.517 --> 04:45.885
 Miss Bliss, what's this I hear

04:45.919 --> 04:49.089
   about your class making $500
   in the stock market?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.758
I better go.
Finance gives me hives.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.361
 Five hundred dollars?

04:54.394 --> 04:55.895
   Care to explain?

04:59.532 --> 05:02.235
  I can't help it if
  their stock keeps going up.

05:02.268 --> 05:05.305
   After all these years,
   my class finally
   picked a winner.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.840
It's wonderful!

05:06.873 --> 05:08.308
It's terrible.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.578
 I don't like this stock market
 thing and I wanna go on
 record right now.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.880
 Mr. Belding,
 you go on record every year.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.249
   I own the album.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.618
And it's gone platinum.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.621
Mylo, would you please?

05:21.654 --> 05:27.961
   Mr. Belding, this is a
   generation raised on video
   games, computers and MTV.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.663
 I have to compete
 for their attention.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.766
  Fine, compete all you want.

05:32.799 --> 05:36.970
 But I really don't think
 they should be making
 more money than I do.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.344
I always dreamed of
breaking out of school.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.714
  I never thought I'd break in.
  It's 6:00 a.m., Zack.

05:47.747 --> 05:50.650
Exactly.
That's the whole idea.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.487
 We're gonna score.
 We're gonna make it.
 We're gonna be rich.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.922
  Zack, I don't think
  this is gonna work.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.958
   It's gotta work.
   I need 300 bucks.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.760
  My back's against the wall.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.297
Why does mine have to be
against the wall, too?

06:04.330 --> 06:07.701
 Mikey, if you could have
 anything in the whole world,

06:07.734 --> 06:09.502
   what would it be?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.371
  A room full of video games.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.640
 Think bigger.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.809
 Well, I always wanted to
 go to Yankee Stadium.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.577
Bigger, Mikey.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.347
 -Have my own jet?
 -Good, Mikey.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.049
   And who would you
   like as your stewardess?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.085
   Justine Bateman.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.887
   And what would you
   like her to wear?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.790
 What would I like her to wear?
 Oh, boy.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.060
   How are we gonna do this?

06:34.060 --> 06:37.731
 Okay, I listened to
 Bliss and found the library.
 You know what they have there?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.532
Books?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.468
The <i>Investment Journal.</i>

06:41.501 --> 06:45.605
  I read about a guy who made
  300 thou on potatoes in
  just 20 minutes.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.408
-Potatoes?
-Yeah.

06:48.441 --> 06:51.878
   Look, you go on to the
   computer, sell our stock,
   and buy potatoes.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.980
  Hey, guys.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.717
   School doesn't start
   for a couple of hours.
   What are you doing here?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.520
Would you believe
Early American History?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.890
 No, I don't.
 Nobody comes to school early.

07:03.923 --> 07:08.028
 Unless,
 they have to use a computer
 for a very special assignment.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.797
  So, why didn't you say so
  in the first place?

07:10.830 --> 07:13.400
 What do you know
 about potatoes, Mylo?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.801
 Potatoes go with everything.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.403
  You can boil them, bake them,
  fry them, filet them.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.704
 They're the food of the '90s.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.039
 See?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.074
 What else do you
 know about potatoes?

07:21.107 --> 07:24.511
   We're right in the middle
   of National Potato Month.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.578
 Whoa!

07:25.612 --> 07:27.047
 This is better than I thought.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.916
-Thanks, Mylo.
-Hey, don't mention it.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.852
  We can't lose.
  It's a sure thing.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.755
  Zack, that was Mylo, not E.F.
  Hutton.

07:36.756 --> 07:40.627
You heard the man.
We're buying potatoes.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.697
Shouldn't we ask
the other kids?
It's their money, too.

07:43.730 --> 07:47.567
I'll handle them.
We're gonna make
their dreams come true.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.637
And my dad will never know
about his video camera.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.906
 Unless he sees
 the video of
 the Zeffirelli twins.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.074
 Yeah.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.643
   What about Bliss?

07:56.676 --> 08:00.013
  Are you kidding?
  She loves it when
  we show initiative.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.682
Go on!

08:02.716 --> 08:06.886
   Miss Bliss,
   I received a call from
   a very concerned parent.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.588
  Is something wrong?
  Is there a problem?

08:08.621 --> 08:11.424
   Yes, he wants
   the name of your broker.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.127
You're kidding!

08:14.160 --> 08:16.596
   Alright, it was just
   a little principal humor.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.666
   But everybody seems to
   wanna get rich
   quick these days.

08:19.699 --> 08:23.470
   We need to teach these kids
   that hard work pays off.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.138
 I couldn't
 agree with you more.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.041
  Then why are you allowing
  them to gamble?

08:28.074 --> 08:30.877
  They're not gambling.
  They're investing.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.611
 Look at my students.

08:32.645 --> 08:36.750
 Have you ever seen
 such hard work and enthusiasm?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.551
  Yes, in Las Vegas.

08:41.054 --> 08:45.425
   Therefore, potatoes
   equal megabucks.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.628
It's time for
the few remaining hold outs
to come aboard.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.165
 I love power lunches.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.467
  Samuel, my man.
  What you got there?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.069
Same as usual. Lasagna.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.705
   My mom puts it in my thermos
   to keep it warm.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.010
 Lasagna-thermos.
 It'll make millions!

09:04.010 --> 09:05.845
 You must want something, Zack.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.547
 That's right, Sammy.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.484
   I want you blasting through
   the stratosphere with me.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.687
 Oh, you're talking thrusters!

09:15.021 --> 09:18.658
We want you to
sell the airline stock
and invest in potatoes.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.428
  Is that all? Sure.

09:21.461 --> 09:25.632
If he asked you to
jump off the Hoosier Dome,
would you do that, too?

09:25.665 --> 09:26.800
 Sure.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.470
   So, how many does
   that make, Mikey?

09:30.503 --> 09:33.773
Well, that's everybody,
except Lisa and Nikki.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.041
  Forget it.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.143
   -Lisa?
   -Forget her, too.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.179
  Nikki,
  she has a mind of her own.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.714
  He's right.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.049
   Zack, she's too smart
   to listen to you.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.617
 She's right.

09:44.651 --> 09:48.955
 So, in other words, you're
 just willing to give up a
 Beverly Hills shopping spree.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.090
 Yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.225
  No.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.628
   So, for a shopping spree,
   you're willing to
   just follow Zack blindly?

09:55.662 --> 09:56.830
  No.

09:56.863 --> 09:57.964
 Yeah.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.599
 When?

09:59.632 --> 10:02.135
  See, Nikki, she does have
  a mind of her own.

10:04.904 --> 10:08.108
I don't trust them.
They're probably
handicapping the races.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.010
Right.

10:10.043 --> 10:14.714
 Zack, nowhere in here does it
 say potatoes are
 the food of the '90s.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.984
Of course not, Nikki.
It's a secret.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.720
 Only those in the know, know.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.622
 Insider information.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.525
 -Insider information?
 -Not anymore.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.162
 Who are you kidding?

10:29.195 --> 10:30.930
 Zack, you're up to something.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.998
Exactly, Nikki.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.602
  The "P" in "potato"
  stands for power, prestige.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.936
  Somebody, quick.
  Give me a "P" word.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.271
  Plutonium!

10:40.073 --> 10:41.808
   So, what about it, Nikki?

10:41.841 --> 10:45.211
  Look, Zack, what if we
  lose the money
  we've already made?

10:45.245 --> 10:48.715
 Big deal. We only threw in
 a couple of
 bucks to start with.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.217
 Okay. Well, who's gonna
 convince Miss Bliss?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.753
She doesn't care.
It's our money.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.823
  -Fine,
  I'll go over and ask her.
  -No.

10:56.856 --> 11:00.760
  It will ruin the surprise
  when we cut her in.

11:00.794 --> 11:04.197
   We're buying her
   a set of mag wheels
   for her new car.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.533
 I don't know.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.069
 Come on, Nikki.
 Do it for Miss Bliss.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.939
 Give me a break, Zack.
 Who do you guys think
 you're dealing with?

11:12.972 --> 11:17.243
   You're right, Nikki.
   We could never fool you.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.681
   But think of all the good
   things you could've done
   with this money.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.217
A habitat for
the endangered condor.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.088
  A safe harbor
  for the sea otters.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.291
 A better life for all of us.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.128
 Enough, Zack. I'm in.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.931
 All: All right! Yeah!

11:37.964 --> 11:41.868
  It's moments like these
  that make all my
  hard work pay off.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.481
  I think it's ridiculous for
  Belding to make me cover
  detention after school

11:54.514 --> 11:56.750
when no kids are
being detained.

11:56.783 --> 12:00.120
  Be patient.
  Belding hasn't done
  his hall sweep yet.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.788
  Oh.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.891
I wonder what this is.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.660
  Well, maybe red
  leather racing gloves
  to match your convertible,

12:07.694 --> 12:09.396
but it's just a guess.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.165
   Oh, Tina!

12:12.198 --> 12:15.301
 You shouldn't have.
 But I'm glad you did.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.705
  Thank you.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.907
 I cannot believe
 that you're
 getting a sports car.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.176
   I am so excited!

12:23.209 --> 12:25.311
  I can just picture it now.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.447
Music blasting.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.449
   Hair blowing in the wind.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.452
  Guys honking at me.

12:32.485 --> 12:38.158
 Tina, if anybody's
 getting honked at,
 it's going to be me.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.225
( both laugh )

12:42.495 --> 12:43.496
  Great news.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.098
   We got in on ground floor

12:45.131 --> 12:47.300
  and that elevator's going
  straight through the roof.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.436
 Where she stops, nobody knows.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.939
 Potatoes have gone up $6,000.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.742
 That's $300 a piece!

12:55.775 --> 12:58.111
   Who knew making
   money could be this easy?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.379
   It's all a plot.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.915
 Grown-ups make us go to school
 so they can
 keep all the money.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.718
   I'm not telling
   my kids, either.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.854
 I see it now.
 I'm on Zack's beach.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.189
   Used to be called Malibu.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.459
Surf City here I come.

13:12.492 --> 13:17.063
 There's only one thing I want.
 American Express Gold.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.233
 Never leave home without it.

13:20.266 --> 13:24.270
  Guys, whatever happened
  to a better
  life for all of us?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.505
  We should save the whales.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.376
 Yeah, as they swim by
 your condo in Hawaii.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.378
 Aloha, Shamu!

13:32.545 --> 13:34.914
 Screech, what are you gonna do
 with your share?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.752
  I'm busy having fun
  in your fantasies.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.087
  I'm too pooped to
  have one of my own.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.155
( bell rings )

13:42.188 --> 13:43.223
Well, see you.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.391
 -Bye.
 -Bye.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.925
  I think we could
  be in deep trouble.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.160
 How deep could it be?

13:47.193 --> 13:49.763
 So deep we'll have
 to drill up for oil.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.865
What do you mean?
We just made six grand.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.099
 We bought on margin.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.467
What's margin?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.003
 If potatoes drop,
 we can end up
 owing lots of money.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.239
 Well, it's not gonna drop.
 We're hot.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.774
 Zack, it's too risky.

14:00.807 --> 14:03.109
  We've made $300.
  Let's get out now.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.310
That's just it, Mikey.

14:04.344 --> 14:08.048
 It's the risk that separates
 the winners from the losers.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.382
   I'm warning you.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.384
 This could end up
 costing Bliss
 a whole lot of money.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.054
  All right,
  we'll get out, in 24 hours.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.455
  I've got a feeling.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.858
 I think there's just a little
 more we can squeeze
 out of the potatoes.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.427
 Okay?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.263
  So, Miss Bliss,
  when are you taking
  your class public?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.131
  I beg your pardon?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.399
   From what I hear,
   they'd be a very
   good investment.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.535
  It's been a big week,
  hasn't it?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.837
  What on earth are
  you talking about?

14:30.870 --> 14:35.275
   Well, rumors are circulating
   that your class has
   made over $15,000.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.278
   Mr. Belding,
   you know kids exaggerate.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.348
Their stock has made them
a whopping $25 apiece.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.084
  Well, the whole school
  is now obsessed with money.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.285
I've had a dozen
requests from students

14:45.318 --> 14:47.454
   to be transferred
   into your
   Investment Banking class.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.489
  But I don't teach
  Investment Banking.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.360
 Aha. That's my point exactly.
 The plug has just been pulled.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.427
 Okay.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.097
I hate to do this,
but I'm
asserting my authority.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.865
  -Fine.
  -What do you mean, "Fine"?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.433
   Just what I said, "Fine."

15:00.467 --> 15:02.135
  No,
  I don't think you understand.
  I'm shutting you down.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.336
  Whatever you want.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.105
  -What's the catch?
  -No catch.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.340
 My week-long project is over.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.043
 And that's an order.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.114
  Zack,
  something's going on here.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.181
  What? What?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.783
  -Zack!
  -Chill out, Mikey.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.052
  I don't have a good
  feeling about this.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.221
 The price of potatoes dropped.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.555
   You mean "dropped"
   as in fluctuated?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.325
   No, "dropped" as in dead.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.093
   What about my gold card?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.162
 What about saving the whales?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.197
 There goes my trip to Venus.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.099
  Excuse me!

15:36.603 --> 15:40.874
 Is it safe to assume
  we're no longer in
 the airline business?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.475
  Uh, gee...

15:42.509 --> 15:44.277
   Yes, Miss Bliss.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.212
 Alright,
 Zack, give it to me straight.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.280
  About what?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.249
Samuel?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.352
 Well, based on
 everything you've taught us,

15:52.385 --> 15:55.855
  Zack took our money
  and dove into
  the potato market.

15:57.424 --> 16:01.928
 That does it.
 I'm gonna have to
 staple my lips shut.

16:02.028 --> 16:06.332
 So, Zack,
 you've taken it upon yourself
 to change the class project?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.802
  Well,
  you see, I didn't exactly
  change the project.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.337
 Only the investment.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.504
I see.

16:11.538 --> 16:16.042
I'm curious. How did
you buy these potatoes?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.477
 On margarine.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.413
   You mean, margin?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.615
  Yeah, yeah, margin.

16:22.649 --> 16:27.253
   So you put up a little money
   to buy a whole
   lot of potatoes?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.555
 That matches my information.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.624
Did you know that
when you buy on margin
and the price plummets,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.927
 that you owe the difference?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.261
 Not exactly.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.897
  Punch up my account, Mikey.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.066
  How much does it say I owe?

16:42.102 --> 16:46.272
 One thousand,
 five hundred and
 sixty seven dollars.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.575
 That's including commission.

16:48.608 --> 16:53.380
Do any of you children know
how much money that is?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.081
  I do! I do!

16:55.515 --> 16:56.983
 And so do I.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.252
  And I have to pay it back.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.920
 We didn't know that.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.589
   Lisa,
   you were in on this, too?

17:02.622 --> 17:03.757
Uh-huh.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.192
 And Nikki, where were you?
 Did you think this was okay?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.292
  Well, not at first.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.128
 But when we
 started making money,

17:09.162 --> 17:11.031
I thought of all
the good things
money could do.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.398
  And that was okay?

17:12.432 --> 17:15.268
   I expected more from
   you, Nikki. I really did.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.603
  And Samuel?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.505
 I was duped!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.508
 I get it. No one can think
 for themselves.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.210
 Right, Mikey?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.479
 I guess not.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.080
  Well, let me tell
  you all something.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.052
  This is, without doubt,
  the most dishonest behavior

17:32.085 --> 17:34.954
   I've ever encountered
   in 14 years of teaching.

17:35.055 --> 17:39.325
This class has
taken it upon itself
not only to deceive me,

17:39.359 --> 17:42.195
  but to steal my
  hard-earned money.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.297
-But, we didn't know that.
-You didn't know that?

17:44.330 --> 17:47.067
   Well, Mr. Big Shot, let me
   tell you something else
   you didn't know.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.235
 You just cost me my new car.

17:56.710 --> 17:59.079
   -What's going on?
   -Nothing.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.280
  Doesn't seem like nothing.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.148
Your class is
there and you're here.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.017
  I just walked out.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.152
   I see.
   You wanna talk about it?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.687
 No, I don't.

18:07.721 --> 18:11.024
 I was awful, I blew it, I went
 too far, I let my anger get
 the better of me.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.459
 And I don't
 wanna talk about it.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.661
 All right, all right.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.030
 If it makes you
 feel any better,
 it's happened to me.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.498
 It happens to every teacher.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.367
   Things build up,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.534
   all of a sudden,
   you're screaming
   at some poor kid

18:21.568 --> 18:23.603
because he just put gum
under his desk.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.038
 Mr. Belding,

18:25.071 --> 18:30.076
 they lost $1,567 of mine
 in the stock market.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.278
   -They what?
   -Exactly.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.180
And it's all my fault.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.316
  I should've known better.
  I let this project
  get out of control.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.451
   I should've known better.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.521
   And I didn't expect it.
   I just didn't expect it.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.289
 Carrie, you're a good teacher.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.091
 You bet I am.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.627
 I even finance the lessons
 with my own money.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.764
Come on!
Don't let this
incident get you down.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.199
  Besides, with your innovative
  teaching methods,

18:53.233 --> 18:56.269
  I'm sure something else will
  go wrong and you'll
  forget all about this.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.406
 Mr. Belding,

18:59.439 --> 19:02.642
wouldn't a simple,
"I told you so,"
be more humane?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.215
   Worst weekend of my life.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.317
  I think I finally
  know what guilt is.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.254
   You mean,
   that sick feeling in
   the pit of your stomach?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.256
   I've got it, too.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.391
   I couldn't sleep.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.593
 I kept having this nightmare.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.363
   I was drowning in
   a sea of mashed potatoes,

19:23.396 --> 19:26.566
 with only a pat of melting
 butter to cling to.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.769
 I'm a complete phony.

19:29.803 --> 19:33.173
  Everything I stand for
  no longer has any meaning.

19:33.807 --> 19:35.408
In the blink of an eye,

19:35.442 --> 19:39.346
 I've become shallow.

19:39.379 --> 19:43.083
  Nikki,
  how can you think of yourself
  at a time like this.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.487
   We've gotta pay
   Miss Bliss back.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.689
 I'm gonna sell my dirt bike.

19:49.723 --> 19:52.525
After I sell my VCR
to pay my father back.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.594
  And I'll sell my computer.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.530
 Good morning.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.600
 All: Good morning, Miss Bliss.

20:02.168 --> 20:06.272
 Well, I'm sure we all had time
 to calm down over the weekend.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.641
I still feel terrible.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.110
We're so sorry.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.444
   So am I.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.713
 What for?
 We deserved to get yelled at.

20:13.747 --> 20:15.682
Yes, you certainly did.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.550
   But not the way I did it.

20:17.584 --> 20:21.154
   I was so upset
   I stopped treating
   you like my kids.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.857
   Because regardless of
   what you do or how
   awful you behave,

20:23.890 --> 20:26.359
 I'll always be there for you.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.161
 I'll always love you.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.330
No matter what.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.698
 Here's the bag you wanted,
 Miss Bliss.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.466
   Thank you, Mylo.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.770
   Class, this is a potato.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.674
   Thanks to you, I own it.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.842
 And this little guy
 didn't travel alone.

20:42.876 --> 20:48.248
   He brought his
   entire family with him.
   All 3,000 pounds of them.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.818
   And they're sitting in the
   middle of my oil-stained
   parking lot staring at me.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.753
 Potatoes have eyes, you know?

20:53.787 --> 20:55.321
   We get your point, Mylo.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.390
I promise we're gonna
get them out of there.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.627
   Yeah, well, I hope so.
   They keep staring at me.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.163
  As a matter of fact,
  I saw one spud
  wearing sunglasses

21:03.196 --> 21:06.166
 with a harmonica singing
<i>Why Should I Be a Fry?</i>

21:10.136 --> 21:11.204
 Okay.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.341
You mastered buying,
now you're gonna
master selling.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.610
  I don't care if you
  mash them or smash them
  or dice them or slice them.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.713
Just move them.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.481
It's liquidation city.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.850
   I'm driving with
   the top down this summer.
