09:20.690 --> 09:23.258
But no crabapples,
I'm afraid.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.433
Oh.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.304
So we'll always be stuck?

09:26.435 --> 09:28.655
Can you think of anywhere else
we could find them, Timmy?

09:28.785 --> 09:30.744
This is becoming
a crabapple emergency.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.833
Hmm...[gasps]

09:32.963 --> 09:34.269
The creek!

09:34.399 --> 09:36.576
There's a crabapple tree
growing by the creek!

09:36.706 --> 09:38.316
That's great!
Thanks, Timmy.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.535
Good luck!

09:42.973 --> 09:44.758
[Sunny]
Okay, the creek's just up ahead.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.848
Door is open,
let's go.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.284
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.894
Why am I still
in the Glam Van?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.288
Because we have
to plan this out.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.420
You put your right
foot out first.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.553
And then I'll put
my right foot out, too.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.645
I've got an idea to get
you working together.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.081
I just need hair ribbons.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.216
Mmm... ha!
There!

10:08.346 --> 10:10.348
Now you'll have
to work as a team.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.959
Just like
a three-legged race.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.831
Outside leg, inside leg.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.313
Um, no,
your inside leg, Rox.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.575
Ohh...

10:19.706 --> 10:21.708
Outside leg, inside leg.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.971
You're really good
at this, Blair.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.363
Thanks.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.843
It helps if you sing it
in your head.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.845
[gasps]
Let's find
those crabapples.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.064
Whoa!

10:30.194 --> 10:32.066
[both]
♪ Inside, outside

10:32.196 --> 10:34.285
♪ Inside, outside Yeah!

10:34.416 --> 10:37.288
♪ Inside and outside
and inside and outside ♪

10:37.419 --> 10:38.507
Whoa!

10:38.638 --> 10:40.814
Sorry, Blair,
your way was best.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.599
Slow and steady.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.035
That's great, guys.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.733
You're really starting
to work together.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.213
Inside, outside,
inside...

10:49.344 --> 10:50.737
We did it!

10:50.867 --> 10:53.740
You'd think three legs
would be faster than two.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.438
Now we just have to find
the crabapple tree.

10:56.568 --> 11:00.355
Remember, we're looking
for really small apples.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.749
Huh, if I climb
that rock...

11:02.879 --> 11:05.142
I'll be able to see
for miles.Where do crabapple
trees grow?

11:05.273 --> 11:06.927
This way!No, this way.

11:07.057 --> 11:10.104
Um, Rox? Blair?
It's that way.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.803
Yes, if I do
a really long run-up,

11:13.934 --> 11:15.239
I can jump the creek.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.719
[both]
Whoa!

11:16.850 --> 11:18.373
Aren't you forgetting
something?

11:18.503 --> 11:19.896
[nervous chuckle]

11:20.027 --> 11:21.724
I need some paper
and pen to plan this out.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.378
Oh, I wish I'd brought
my tape measure.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.815
How about we make
a rope swing?

11:25.946 --> 11:30.472
Hmm... I'll just braid
these hair ribbons.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.517
So which branch do you
think I should aim for?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.911
Well, I haven't got
my tape measure,

11:35.042 --> 11:37.174
but I'd say... that one!

11:37.305 --> 11:39.220
Yeah!
Blair's right.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.048
That branch looks
strong and sturdy.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.092
Thanks, Rox.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.008
[grunts]Whoa!

11:45.139 --> 11:46.662
That should get us
across the creek.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.098
I'll go first.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.058
[grunts]

11:51.188 --> 11:52.799
Great, ready to jump.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.453
Wait, I've never
jumped this far before.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.454
I'm nervous.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.586
Don't worry.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.283
I'm an expert jumper,
remember?

11:59.414 --> 12:01.068
Just hang on tight.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.026
[both screaming]

12:03.157 --> 12:04.462
[panting]

12:04.593 --> 12:06.203
You can open your
eyes now, Blair.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.426
I made it.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.602
And that was
sort of fun!

12:13.733 --> 12:14.821
[laughing]
Thanks, Rox.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.692
I never would've
done it without you.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.042
[Sunny]
Come on, let's grab
some crabapples.

12:21.131 --> 12:25.092
♪ Outside, inside,
outside, inside ♪

12:25.222 --> 12:26.833
♪ Outside, inside...

12:26.963 --> 12:28.573
Hey, you're not
tripping over each other.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.314
You're working
together.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.186
[both]
We are?

12:32.316 --> 12:33.448
We are!

12:33.578 --> 12:34.492
Oh!

12:34.623 --> 12:36.059
Whoops!

12:36.190 --> 12:37.060
[both laughing]

12:37.191 --> 12:38.105
Thanks.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.368
No problem.Teamwork.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.023
So what's next on our
unstick solution list?

12:43.153 --> 12:46.069
Crabapples, sugar,
water, and salt.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
So, sugar.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.507
And I know just
where to find some.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.639
Let's go.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.427
Hi, Cindy.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.951
Wow, you look busy.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.866
I am... whoa.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.694
I'm making a big order
for the ballerinas.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.480
Pink cupcakes to match
their pink tutus.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.483
They look great.
Mmm...

13:08.613 --> 13:11.312
Yeah, do you need someone
to taste-test them?

13:11.442 --> 13:12.879
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.358
[chuckling]

13:14.489 --> 13:16.665
Oh, I think I have only
enough for the show.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.146
Whoo, what happened
there?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.191
Rox and Blair
are stuck together.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.498
And we need to make
some unstick solution.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.326
May we borrow
some sugar?

13:25.456 --> 13:26.631
Sure.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.851
I'll just pop these down...

13:28.982 --> 13:30.331
Uh, let me see.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.462
I'll take them...Here, Cindy.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.812
[both grunting]
Oh!

13:32.942 --> 13:35.205
Whoa!

13:35.336 --> 13:37.120
Uh-oh.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.514
[loud splat]Oh, no!

13:39.644 --> 13:42.125
[gasps]
My poor cupcakes.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.605
[both]
Sorry, Cindy.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.563
I'll never be able
to remake them

13:45.694 --> 13:47.565
in time for the ballerinas!

13:47.696 --> 13:49.132
What a mess.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.005
We're a walking, talking,
stuck-together disaster.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.311
We can totally fix this.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.617
If we work together.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.488
Teamwork, remember?

13:58.925 --> 14:01.101
Mixing bowls,
spoons.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.016
Flour, eggs.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.932
Salt and sugar.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.108
Oh, I need butter
and milk from the fridge.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.326
Be right back.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.459
Oh, and don't forget
measuring cups.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.853
Everything has to be
measured exactly.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.855
I'll do it.Nah, I'll do it.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.770
Flour, eggs, and...

14:18.901 --> 14:20.424
Oh, well, we should
wait for Cindy.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.556
She's the expert.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.123
[chuckles]
Yeah, no time.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.341
You're right.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.042
And sugar!

14:29.172 --> 14:31.000
Lots of it!

14:31.131 --> 14:32.959
[screeches]

14:33.089 --> 14:33.960
[laughing]

14:35.962 --> 14:37.528
What happened?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.400
It looks kind of lumpy.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.837
More lumps equal
more taste.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.274
There, time
to bake them.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.320
[sniffing]

14:46.450 --> 14:48.017
Whoo-hoo!

14:48.148 --> 14:49.845
These look delicious!

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
Mmm...

14:52.108 --> 14:53.675
[loud gulp]
Oh!

14:53.805 --> 14:55.851
These are  not delicious.

14:55.982 --> 14:56.983
Hmm...
[smacking]

14:57.113 --> 14:58.332
Mmm.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.594
[loud gulp]

14:59.724 --> 15:03.250
They're...
they're... awful.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.381
Ew!

15:05.817 --> 15:07.689
[gasps]
And no wonder.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.735
You used salt,
not sugar.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.825
Mm, they're sort
of oozey, too.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.872
Maybe I should have
measured, Blair.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.482
And waited for Cindy.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.789
Don't worry,
we'll just start over.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.575
And this time, we'll follow
Cindy's instructions exactly.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.534
Starting with measurements.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.971
Teamwork?Teamwork.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.234
Okay, let's get
rid of this.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.193
I've got it.
Watch this.

15:33.323 --> 15:36.152
Cupcakes into the trash
in one shot.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.284
Hey, how is it...

15:37.414 --> 15:38.676
[all gasping]

15:38.807 --> 15:40.287
...going?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.811
Now I'm all sticky, too.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.073
[laughing]

15:44.204 --> 15:45.901
Let's get to work.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.556
We've got cupcakes to make,
right, Blair?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.559
Yeah, and the ballet's
going to start soon.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.039
Teamwork?Teamwork.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.130
We did it.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.001
Mmm, delicious.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.394
Amazing what you can do

16:00.524 --> 16:02.135
when you find a way
to work together.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.484
But we've gotta go.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.876
Can't keep
the ballerinas waiting.

16:05.007 --> 16:05.965
Bye, Cindy!

16:06.095 --> 16:07.096
See you at the ballet.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.228
Wait a second.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.447
What about your
unstick solution?

16:10.578 --> 16:13.233
I think you needed sugar.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.278
Anything else?

16:15.409 --> 16:16.627
Oh, let's see.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.108
Crabapples, sugar, salt.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.675
Do you have
any salt?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.546
Um, about that, I...

16:22.677 --> 16:25.375
We had a little mix-up
in the kitchen.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.943
Now there's no salt left.
My bad.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.597
It's okay.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.643
I know where we can
get salt  and water.

16:32.774 --> 16:33.818
The sea!

16:33.949 --> 16:35.255
That's made
of saltwater.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.647
Good-bye!Thanks, Cindy.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.475
Bye!See you later.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.173
[door closes]

16:40.303 --> 16:42.175
[sniffs]
Mmm!

16:42.305 --> 16:44.307

16:44.438 --> 16:45.917
Here you go, Ralph.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.223

16:48.659 --> 16:49.965
[Sunny]
Here we are, the sea!

16:52.315 --> 16:53.360
Ooh!

16:53.490 --> 16:55.014
You didn't fall off
this time.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.711
[both]
Yes!

16:58.887 --> 17:00.758
[chuckling]
We'll just get the saltwater

17:00.889 --> 17:02.760
added to the crabapples
and the sugar.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.241
Make the unstick solution
and get to the ballet

17:05.372 --> 17:07.548
in time to style
the ballerinas.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.161
That water is a really
long way down.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.684
Hmm...

17:13.815 --> 17:16.774
So we'll need to get
the saltwater up.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.125
That means we have
to lower something down

17:19.255 --> 17:20.213
that can hold it.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.389
Something waterproof.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.130
What about this
gel tub you used

17:24.260 --> 17:25.957
to get us out
of the Glam Van, Sunny?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.568
It's empty now.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.004
Great thinking.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.529
Some ribbon...
and braid them like so.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.227
And... this should work.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.621
Wait, we need something
that will stick the tub

17:37.752 --> 17:38.970
to the end of the ribbon.

17:39.101 --> 17:42.365
We could stick it with
super-stick hairspray.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.759
Only if you agree
that's a good plan, Blair?

17:44.889 --> 17:46.587
I think
it's the perfect plan.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.285
I'll get it.Let me.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.200
Whoa!

17:51.331 --> 17:52.506
[both gasping]

17:52.636 --> 17:54.290
Mm... 'kay.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.380
The good news is the spray
has stuck to the ribbon.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.905
The bad news is
the ribbon has stuck to me.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.820
And I'm stuck
to the railing!

18:02.951 --> 18:04.518
Now what?

18:06.650 --> 18:07.477
Hmm...

18:07.608 --> 18:09.914
I'm thinking we can
fix this if...

18:10.045 --> 18:11.612
...we work together.

18:11.742 --> 18:12.917
We did it at the creek.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.310
And at Cindy's.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.920
And you can do it now.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.793
You're great on your own,
but together you're awesome.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.403
What's the plan?

18:20.534 --> 18:23.406
We need saltwater to make
the unstick solution.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.583
We could make
a water pulley.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.412
We'll need our largest,
stretchiest hair band.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.153
Some big sponge hair rollers

18:31.284 --> 18:33.155
because sponges are great
at soaking up water.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.114
That's just off the top
of my head, of course.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.818
Snap the curlers
on the ribbon.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.994
Great job, Blair.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.822
You can do this, Rox.

18:49.693 --> 18:50.607
Ooh!

18:52.261 --> 18:53.306
Great throw!

18:54.872 --> 18:56.744
Yeah.Yay!

18:56.874 --> 19:00.748
Now let's get that saltwater
and make the unstick solution!

19:08.843 --> 19:10.801
Now that is teamwork.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.022
And that should be
enough saltwater.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.284
Add the crabapple juice.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.460
And sugar.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.810
Now to give it
a good shake.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.336
[gasps]
I'm unstuck!

19:23.466 --> 19:26.339
Yay! You did it!

19:26.469 --> 19:31.170
[both chanting]
We did it! We did it!
We did it! We did it!

19:31.300 --> 19:33.172
Now let's unstick you, too.

[both grunting]

19:37.698 --> 19:39.526
Whoo-hoo!Whoo!

19:39.656 --> 19:41.005
Yeah!Yay!

19:41.136 --> 19:45.053
Wow!
This feels... weird.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.447
I was getting used
to being stuck to you.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.362
Want me to stick you
back together?

19:49.492 --> 19:51.015
No!No!

19:51.146 --> 19:53.975
Good, because we need that
super-stick hairspray

19:54.105 --> 19:55.019
for the ballerinas.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.760
If we hurry,
we should just make it.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.896
Hang on, we don't need
to stick together anymore.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.680
[both laughing]

20:03.811 --> 20:06.379
Sticky solution or not,
we'll always stick together.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.034
Hi, Sunny.Hi, Hannah.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.210
Just in time.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.254
Sorry we're late.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.038
We got a little... stuck.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.737
But we'll get you
show-ready in no time.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.305
Okay, we'll take you
right over here.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.526
That looks good.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.354
This is gonna be fun!
I hope you like it.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.618
You look great.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.362
Wow, that's awesome.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.324
Let's pull this back.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.501
Super springy, super strong
hair elastics.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.940
Then twist.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.421
Some hairpins.

20:49.813 --> 20:50.988
Next.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.301
And for the finishing touch...

20:59.432 --> 21:01.434
a little sticky spray.

21:02.870 --> 21:03.784
Tada!

21:03.914 --> 21:05.699
Perfect.Teamwork.

Thanks, Sunny.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.447
We all love
our ballerina buns.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.144
Wanna stick around
for the show?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.930
I think we've done enough
sticking for one day.

21:20.061 --> 21:20.931

21:21.062 --> 21:22.455
But we would love
to see the show.

Yeah!Sure would.

Sunny, you need
