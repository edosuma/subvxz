WEBVTT

00:14.640 --> 00:17.226
-"Hello, Mrs. Geneva Camarena?"
-"Yes."

00:17.309 --> 00:19.603
"It's the White House.
President Reagan is calling."

00:19.687 --> 00:20.938
"Yes, ma'am."

00:21.021 --> 00:23.566
"All right, one moment please."

00:26.485 --> 00:27.653
"Hello, Mrs. Camarena?"

00:27.737 --> 00:29.655
"Yes, sir."

00:29.739 --> 00:33.534
"I just wanted you to know
that Nancy and I...

00:33.617 --> 00:39.039
"You're in our prayers.
You have our deepest sympathy.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.834
"Your husband
died for his country

00:41.917 --> 00:44.044
-in every sense of the word."
-"Yes, sir."

00:44.128 --> 00:45.713
"And we'll remember your husband

00:45.838 --> 00:48.424
for his love and dedication
to this country."

00:48.507 --> 00:50.468
"Thank you, sir."

00:50.551 --> 00:53.012
"And I just want you
to know, also...

00:53.095 --> 00:55.639
"I'm determined

00:55.723 --> 00:57.725
"that we're going to
pursue this drug thing

00:57.808 --> 00:59.268
"and the kind of monsters

00:59.351 --> 01:03.189
that perpetrate
this kind of crime."

01:09.236 --> 01:10.738
INTERVIEWER:
How hard was it leaving
Mexico without him?

01:19.747 --> 01:20.873
(whimpers)

01:28.756 --> 01:30.090
(whimpers)

01:41.143 --> 01:43.270
He was my whole world.

01:50.361 --> 01:53.197
TOM BROKAW:
It was a brutal day in
the drug wars of Mexico,

01:53.280 --> 01:55.991
and an American drug agent
is one of the victims.

01:56.075 --> 01:59.453
The body of Enrique Camarena
was found today,

01:59.537 --> 02:01.121
beaten, bound,

02:01.205 --> 02:02.540
wrapped in plastic,
and dropped in a field.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.041
He had been missing
for a month.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.709
MALE REPORTER:
The bodies were found

02:05.793 --> 02:07.253
along a well-traveled highway

02:07.336 --> 02:08.754
about 70 miles
from Guadalajara.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.258
The bodies were taken
to a hospital morgue

02:12.341 --> 02:14.260
in nearby Zamora.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.762
The commander of the Mexican
police task force investigating

02:16.846 --> 02:19.306
the disappearance
of Camarena arrived.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.767
The U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's top man

02:21.851 --> 02:23.269
in Mexico was also there.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.895
He looked shaken as he left.

02:24.979 --> 02:25.896
(horn honks)

02:27.231 --> 02:28.983
(siren chirps)

02:32.528 --> 02:35.781
HOLM: It hit me hard
because the agents told me...

02:35.865 --> 02:37.491
what they did to Kiki.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.118
And I went home,

02:39.201 --> 02:42.079
and my wife
had never seen me cry.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.832
And she saw that I was upset.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.793
I got a beer
and sat by the pool.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.128
She said,
"What happened?"

02:49.211 --> 02:50.754
I says,
"They tortured him."

02:50.838 --> 02:53.382
You know, I didn't
tell her what they did.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.095
And my little girl said,
"Mommy, Mommy, I'm scared."

02:58.178 --> 02:59.930
(nervous laugh)

03:00.014 --> 03:01.181
"Daddy's crying."

03:03.475 --> 03:07.605
So anyhow,
I had an emotional reaction,

03:07.688 --> 03:10.649
which makes you want
to retaliate.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.499
MALE NARRATOR:
In 1985, the kidnapping,
torture, and murder

03:27.583 --> 03:32.129
of DEA agent Kiki Camarena
transformed Mexico

03:32.212 --> 03:35.257
into the newest frontline
in the war on drugs.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.093
Under intense pressure
from the Reagan Administration,

03:38.177 --> 03:42.181
the government of Mexico
arrested two drug lords
for the murder

03:42.264 --> 03:44.433
but refused to extradite them
to the U.S.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.270
Instead, Rafael Caro Quintero

03:48.354 --> 03:50.481
and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo

03:50.564 --> 03:53.901
divvied up the cartel
from lavish prison cells

03:53.984 --> 03:55.945
stocked with liquor, drugs,

03:56.028 --> 03:59.531
women, and exotic animals.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.201
In response,
the DEA reassigned

04:02.284 --> 04:04.370
its most aggressive narcs
to Mexico.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.497
They came
with huge snitch budgets

04:06.580 --> 04:08.290
and orders from the White House

04:08.374 --> 04:11.043
to bring the full fury
of America's drug war

04:11.126 --> 04:13.671
to the doorstep
of the Guadalajara Cartel.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.412
BERRELLEZ:
Two years after Kiki's murder,

04:46.495 --> 04:48.664
I was promoted and assigned
resident agent in charge

04:48.747 --> 04:52.334
of the Mazatlán, Sinaloa,
Mexico office,

04:52.418 --> 04:55.087
and his assassination was
very present and clear.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.340
So I knew that I needed
to be very, very careful.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.264
Mazatlán was super hot.
As a matter of fact,

05:05.347 --> 05:08.017
Mazatlán was the hottest area
of all of Mexico,

05:08.100 --> 05:09.935
because all
the major drug lords,

05:10.019 --> 05:13.188
they were all from
the state of Sinaloa.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.232
And they all had businesses
in Mazatlán.

big shootouts.

05:58.734 --> 06:02.321
And Hector was in
the middle of all of that.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.698
He could get killed
at any moment.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.533
Well, I suffered a lot.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.787

BROKAW: This case has
stirred international
repercussions and outrage.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.495
And the U.S. government still
is trying to bring his killers
to justice.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.622
MALE REPORTER:
In the nearly two years since,

06:53.705 --> 06:57.501
no one has been brought
to trial for Camarena's murder.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.004
This agency has not
and I hope will not stop

07:01.088 --> 07:04.466
until we have brought
everyone involved to justice.

07:04.550 --> 07:08.846
How long do you believe
we are going to wait?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.431
It has been a year and a half.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.768
MALE REPORTER:
Congressmen charge evidence has
been destroyed or disappeared,

07:14.852 --> 07:17.062
while Mexican police
continue the cover-up.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.398
Our commitment is firm
to this,

07:19.481 --> 07:21.275
and I'm certainly
not gonna sit here and say

07:21.358 --> 07:23.777
that there haven't been
frustrations in our efforts.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.406
-It's a fraud.
-I don't think there's
the smallest possibility

07:27.489 --> 07:31.243
that the Mexican government
will ever...

07:31.326 --> 07:34.246
fully ventilate
the Camarena case.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.915
I agree with the DEA agent,
who's knowledgeable,

07:36.999 --> 07:39.501
who told me the government
of Mexico would collapse.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.752
I agree with him.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.935
BERRELLEZ: I get a call
from an agent out of Colombia,

07:57.019 --> 08:00.772
and he tells me that they
are investigating a shipload

08:00.856 --> 08:03.650
with tons of marijuana
and cocaine.

08:03.734 --> 08:08.572
We've been also doing wiretaps
on the Escobar-Medellín Cartel.

08:08.655 --> 08:14.203
And the recipient of the drugs
is being called at this number.

08:14.286 --> 08:18.373
That number comes back
to a Pablo Jacobo

08:18.457 --> 08:22.294
at a little store
in Navolato, Sinaloa.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.051
So we proceeded to Navolato
from Mazatlán,

08:29.134 --> 08:31.845
and we go directly
to the store.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.723
I walk in with my AK-47 here
and my gun like this,

08:34.806 --> 08:37.100
and I see a guy standing
behind the counter and I go...

08:37.643 --> 08:40.854
"Federal Police, we are
looking for Pablo Jacobo!"

08:40.938 --> 08:43.982
And he turns around
and says, "There's nobody
here with that name."

08:44.066 --> 08:45.609
But I see him going
to a drawer,

08:45.692 --> 08:47.736
so I run up and I put
my gun on his head.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.781
"Freeze, motherfucker!
Or I'll kill you!"

08:50.864 --> 08:53.867
"Where are the drugs?"
And he says,

08:53.951 --> 08:56.495
"They are at
my ranch, in Limoncito.
They're not here."

08:56.578 --> 08:59.957
Is there anybody there?
He says, "No, no, there's
nobody there.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.626
Just my ranchers."

09:13.387 --> 09:15.681
WHITE: So we're driving up
in four vehicles.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.557
It was a total of 16 of us--

09:17.641 --> 09:20.227
12 Mex Feds and 4 DEA.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.327
I don't like it.
I'm looking down my binoculars.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.038
All of a sudden, I remember
my mom's premonition.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.044
Before I reported to Mexico,

09:46.128 --> 09:48.630
she said,
"Son, before you leave,

09:48.714 --> 09:50.299
I'd like to do a tarot card
reading on you."

09:57.556 --> 09:59.391
It's a field with...

09:59.474 --> 10:01.393
rows of corn.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.065
All these fields
are sown with corn.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.822
Death, injuries, blood...

10:13.905 --> 10:16.867
I see blood all over the place.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.505
So I tell my men,
"Okay, everybody mount up.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.758
Everybody put their vests on.
We're gonna go in."

10:47.481 --> 10:49.608
WHITE: One of the Mex Feds
yells "cuerno."

10:49.691 --> 10:53.445
And that's the term they use
for AK-47s.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.530
And I'm thinking,
"Shit, we are screwed."

11:00.619 --> 11:02.746
BERRELLEZ: And I could see
there was, like, a silo,

11:02.829 --> 11:05.457
and, man, there was
a guy just pouring.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.584
Lit it up with a machine gun.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.462
WHITE: The Mex Fed on my
right side, he got hit...

11:10.545 --> 11:15.050
and the AK-47 fire just about
severed his arm.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.721
CHATITA:
I can see them running
in the cornfields.

11:19.805 --> 11:20.806
Some fall,

11:20.889 --> 11:22.265
others run,

11:22.349 --> 11:25.185
but I can see blood
raining down.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.858
BERRELLEZ: Some of the Mex
Feds are all shot up.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.820
"We're bleeding to death here,
please help us!

11:34.903 --> 11:37.572
Please, we are gonna die here!"

11:37.989 --> 11:41.576
And I said, "Jim, we gotta
get those wounded guys."

11:41.660 --> 11:43.578
And I started grabbing guys
and pulling them to the side.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.331
And we threw them
in the back of the Ram Charger.

11:46.415 --> 11:50.335
WHITE: I laid down,
and I, using my left hand

11:50.419 --> 11:53.213
to run the gas pedal,
and my right hand to steer with,

11:53.296 --> 11:55.715
and it went in reverse.

11:55.799 --> 11:59.428
Hector with his AK was laying
down fire while I was driving.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.017
BERRELLEZ: So we're
driving down the main highway
and then one of them says...

12:06.101 --> 12:09.438
"Hey, boss, would you give
me a cigarette, please?"

12:09.521 --> 12:12.607
And I go, "Okay.
I'll give you a cigarette."

12:12.691 --> 12:15.610
All of a sudden,
I hear laughter.
I look back.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.654
"Hey, what's going on?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.197
Why are you laughing?"

12:19.281 --> 12:20.949
And the guy goes, "Mira!"

12:21.032 --> 12:22.993
And he pulls on the cigarette,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.495
and you can see smoke
coming out of his chest.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.123
He had a sucking chest wound,
and he's smoking.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.714
And then, all of a sudden,
I see a taxicab's
coming our way

12:35.797 --> 12:36.923
in the opposite direction.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.259
So then we go,
"Stop!"

12:39.342 --> 12:41.887
Alto! I point
my rifle at him.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.389
I says, "Give me the keys
to your cab."

12:44.473 --> 12:47.767
And he goes,
"Are you taking my cab?"

12:47.851 --> 12:49.644
"Yes, you're lending it to me!"

12:51.104 --> 12:53.899
Jim, he's gonna take you
to the hospital.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.027
I'm gonna go back
to the shootout in a taxicab.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.919
I pulled into the shootout
scene, to the ranch again,

13:14.002 --> 13:15.837
and the gunfire's
still going on.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.507
Everybody's shooting
happy-go-lucky there.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.427
And as soon as I pull in,
everybody stops shooting.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.137
It's silence.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.518
The crooks are wondering,
"Who's in the cab?"

13:29.601 --> 13:31.394
My guys are wondering,

13:31.478 --> 13:32.854
"Why's that cab here?
Who's in the cab?"

13:32.938 --> 13:34.356
So finally,
I get out of the cab,

13:34.439 --> 13:35.899
and I yell, "It's me, guys!"

13:50.288 --> 13:54.251
Finally,
the Mexican army shows up.
and I run up to them.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.919
I said, "Do you have an M-79?"

13:56.002 --> 13:59.464
"Oh, a grenade launcher!
Yes, I've got one!"

13:59.548 --> 14:00.840
"Please, bring it to me!"

14:04.052 --> 14:05.887
So then I shot a couple
of grenades up there.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.601
So all of sudden, they start
putting white shirts and stuff,

14:11.685 --> 14:13.186
wanting to surrender.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.730
So then the prisoners
start coming out.

14:15.814 --> 14:19.818
And of course, the dope is
there in a big semi-truck.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.445
Of course, there's dead
on their side.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.198
We killed some
of the traffickers.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.950
They had been laying there
dead for so long

14:27.033 --> 14:29.494
that rigor mortis had set in.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.413
I mean, they were stiff.

14:34.916 --> 14:39.421
Finally, as we're picking up
everything,

14:39.504 --> 14:41.214
I remember the guy
up in the silo.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.094
So I walk underneath,
and I shoot up.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.888
Like 60 rounds.
(imitates gunfire)

14:48.972 --> 14:52.767
And this-- this guy falls from,
like, from the sky. Bam!

14:52.851 --> 14:54.311
And he's going,
"Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!"

14:54.394 --> 14:57.022
And I go,
"What's wrong with you?"

14:57.105 --> 14:58.648
"I've been shot!"

14:58.732 --> 15:00.817
"You shot me in my leg."
(chuckles)

15:06.239 --> 15:09.451
MALE REPORTER:
This gun battle then raged on
for over two hours,

15:09.534 --> 15:13.330
with over 20,000 rounds
expended by the narcotic
traffickers.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.167
It should be noted that
this was the longest gun battle

15:17.250 --> 15:20.045
in the history of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.256
As a comparison,
in the Vietnam war,

15:23.340 --> 15:25.508
American soldiers were
under heavy gunfire

15:25.592 --> 15:27.969
for an average
of 15 to 20 minutes

15:28.053 --> 15:31.181
before getting air
or artillery support.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.018
Special Agent
Hector G. Berrellez's actions

15:35.101 --> 15:36.811
upheld the finest traditions

15:36.895 --> 15:38.730
of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.649
and are hereby recognized

15:40.732 --> 15:42.651
by awarding him
the Federal Bar Association's

15:42.734 --> 15:44.402
Medal of Valor.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.862
(applause)

15:52.035 --> 15:55.205
MALE REPORTER:
As a result of this raid
by Special Agent Berrellez,

15:55.288 --> 15:58.500
several major drug overlords
were arrested.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.795
Because of those arrests,
Special Agent Berrellez

16:01.878 --> 16:04.964
and his family
were targeted for execution.

16:07.717 --> 16:11.179
BERRELLEZ: When the word
got out I had been targeted
for assassination,

16:11.262 --> 16:13.765
by Miguel Félix Gallardo
and the Guadalajara Cartel,

16:13.848 --> 16:15.850
they pulled me out.

16:15.934 --> 16:19.145
They said, "You gotta leave.
They're gonna kill you.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.231
"We're gonna escort you
to the airport right now,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.483
and you're out of here,
we're gonna take you back
to the States."

16:23.566 --> 16:25.944
And all I had was
what I was wearing and my gun.

16:26.027 --> 16:29.322
And I got on a plane and
headed for the United States.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.169
BERRELLEZ: I'm in Arizona,
and I'm praying for my life.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.296
So I remained there for,
like three months.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.965
I didn't hear anything.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.883
I was being paid,
but I was getting bored,

16:48.967 --> 16:51.970
just doing nothing,
just staying in a nice hotel.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.848
And one day, the agent says,

16:54.931 --> 16:56.683
"Hey, you gotta come
to the office.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.727
The administrator wants
to talk to you."

16:58.810 --> 17:01.062
So I dial the number.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.605
And a voice
comes on the line,

17:02.689 --> 17:03.898
he says, "I'm Jack Lawn.
I'm the administrator.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.900
How are you, Hector?"

17:05.984 --> 17:08.194
And I said,
"I'm fine, sir. How are you?"

17:08.278 --> 17:11.030
He says, "I'm fine. You ready
to come back to work?"

17:11.114 --> 17:12.991
I says, "I'd love to."

17:13.074 --> 17:15.577
He says, uh...

17:15.660 --> 17:18.663
"How'd you like to run the
Camarena murder investigation?

17:18.747 --> 17:22.834
How'd you like
to be the supervisor
of Operation Leyenda?"

17:30.049 --> 17:32.635
I said, "I'd love that.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.429
That's an honor.
I'll take that case."

17:38.933 --> 17:42.145
MEDRANO: If you wanted
a chance at success
in this investigation,

17:42.228 --> 17:45.023
you needed Chicano agents.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.025
You needed Mexican-American
agents.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.610
You needed Spanish-speaking
agents.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.820
You needed agents
who had been doing

17:50.904 --> 17:53.156
undercover drug deals
in the barrio,

17:53.239 --> 17:57.702
who knew and understood the DNA
of Mexican drug dealers.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.663
And the agent who epitomized,

18:00.747 --> 18:03.750
who I believed
to be the ideal agent

18:03.833 --> 18:06.544
to go after these bad guys
for Camarena's murder,

18:06.628 --> 18:08.546
was-- was Hector Berrellez.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.052
He had been in firefights
down in Mexico before.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.972
Hector Berrellez knew
and understood Mexico.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.689
BERRELLEZ: At that juncture
in the investigation,

18:26.773 --> 18:29.526
the DEA had not recruited
one person

18:29.609 --> 18:31.528
that could tell them
what happened to Kiki.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.531
They don't have any informants
or witnesses

18:34.614 --> 18:36.616
that were there
when Kiki was picked up,

18:36.699 --> 18:38.618
that were there
when Kiki was tortured.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.537
They don't know what happened.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.415
The director of DEA,
Jack Lawn asked me,
he says,

18:44.499 --> 18:46.417
"You will be able
to get me witnesses?"

18:46.501 --> 18:48.086
I said, "Of course."

18:48.169 --> 18:50.129
I said, "I'm gonna have
to spend a lot of money,

18:50.213 --> 18:51.548
'cause I'm gonna have to bring
whole families out here."

18:51.631 --> 18:53.091
He said, "Whole families?"

18:53.174 --> 18:54.884
I says, "Yeah, you can't
bring a guy over here

18:54.968 --> 18:56.553
"and leaving his family
back there.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.137
"Soon as they found out
he's working for us,

18:58.221 --> 18:59.973
"they're gonna kill
his whole family.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.808
"So you're gonna have
to be prepared to give me

19:01.891 --> 19:03.852
"that kind of support
and put some of these people

19:03.935 --> 19:05.728
under Witness
Protection Program."

19:05.812 --> 19:07.605
He says, "Fine. You run it
the way you have to run it.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.482
"You have my support.
And by the way,

19:09.566 --> 19:11.484
how much money you think
you're gonna need?"

19:11.568 --> 19:13.111
I said, "I'm gonna need
a big informant budget.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.696
I'm talking about
three million."

19:14.779 --> 19:16.573
He said, "What? That much?"

19:16.656 --> 19:19.033
And I said, "Yeah,
I gotta develop
informants in Los Pinos.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.287
Those guys are gonna run,
like, ten grand a month."

19:22.370 --> 19:24.414
He says, "You can get
informants in Los Pinos?"

19:24.497 --> 19:26.624
That's the Mexican
White House.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.877
I said, "Of course."

19:28.960 --> 19:30.128
I said, "We're talking
big, big time here."

19:30.211 --> 19:31.838
He says, "You got my support.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.090
"Get me people that were there
that can tell us

19:34.173 --> 19:35.758
"what happened to Kiki.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.093
"I wanna know from the time
he got picked up

19:37.176 --> 19:38.678
"till the time he died.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.263
I wanna know what happened
to that man."

19:50.106 --> 19:52.901
I recruited informants
that I knew

19:52.984 --> 19:54.986
knew the people
that were involved.

19:55.069 --> 19:58.114
And one of them was
this young man by the name of--

19:58.197 --> 19:59.449
We called him Rafa.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.411
He ran brothels down there.

20:03.494 --> 20:06.664
And because he was providing
women to the cartel members,

20:06.748 --> 20:10.126
he knew who ran with him,
who the bodyguards were,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.878
who was close to these guys.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.840
He says,
"I know this guy Jorge Godoy."

20:19.427 --> 20:22.472
Ah, fucking Rafa.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.724
The phone rang.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.102
The early cellphones we used,

20:28.186 --> 20:29.854
that were like fucking bricks
like this.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.816
"Listen,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.778
"this is Hector Berrellez,

20:36.861 --> 20:39.864
"chief of the DEA
Pacific Division.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.784
"From Alaska
to Tierra del Fuego,

20:42.867 --> 20:45.244
all the way down
to Argentina, dude."

20:48.081 --> 20:50.416
"And what can I do
for you, sir?"

20:51.417 --> 20:53.670
BERRELLEZ: I says,
"I need your help, man."

20:53.753 --> 20:55.588
I says, "Why don't you come
up here and help me investigate

20:55.672 --> 20:57.173
the murder of Enrique?"

20:59.008 --> 21:01.386
He goes,
"No, you're gonna arrest me."

21:02.553 --> 21:05.306
"You are going to fuck me...

21:06.099 --> 21:08.768
I'm a stinking dog."

21:10.269 --> 21:12.605
BERRELLEZ:
And I said, "Listen..."

21:12.689 --> 21:15.233
"Do you believe in God?"

21:19.862 --> 21:23.282
"Yes, I believe in God."

21:23.366 --> 21:26.160
"Then believe in me, bastard.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.247
"I'm going to change
your whole life.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.207
You know everything,
motherfucker."

21:33.167 --> 21:35.420
"I swear to God

21:35.503 --> 21:38.715
that if you cooperate,
I will not arrest you."

21:40.758 --> 21:42.969
I told him,
"Just give me a chance

21:43.052 --> 21:45.847
"to say goodbye
to my children.

21:45.930 --> 21:50.393
"And if you're going to
fuck me, then do it.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.022
I'll go."

21:55.690 --> 21:59.193
BERRELLEZ: So they arrived
in Tijuana and took a cab
to the port of entry,

21:59.277 --> 22:00.528
where I was waiting for them.

22:00.611 --> 22:01.863
I saw a very frightened man,

22:01.946 --> 22:03.614
a very frightened man.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.783
I said, "Don't be nervous,
calm down.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.368
What can I do for you?"

22:07.452 --> 22:10.538
He said, "I need a beer.
Please bring me a beer."

22:10.621 --> 22:12.832
So we got him a 12-pack
of Budweiser,

22:12.915 --> 22:14.459
and we started driving
towards L.A.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.836
And I started asking him
about what he knew.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.843
He said that he had been
a pistolero, a bodyguard,

22:23.926 --> 22:25.595
for Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo

22:25.678 --> 22:27.930
the jefe de jefes,
the boss of bosses

22:28.014 --> 22:29.849
of the Guadalajara Cartel.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.851
He told me that he had
been a state policeman

22:31.934 --> 22:35.146
assigned to protect
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo

22:35.229 --> 22:37.315
and Rafael Caro Quintero

22:37.398 --> 22:38.941
who were involved
in Kiki's murder.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.362
He told me that he had been in
a lot of pre-abduction meetings

22:43.446 --> 22:46.199
where they discussed

22:46.282 --> 22:49.494
how they were going to pick him
up and interrogate him.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.370
"Do you know other people
that were there?"

22:51.454 --> 22:53.790
He said, "I know everybody.
I know who picked him up."

22:58.503 --> 23:01.672
He told me that René was
a good friend who was
also assigned

23:01.756 --> 23:04.675
to Ernesto Fonseca's
protection detail,

23:04.759 --> 23:06.677
that he was also
a homicide cop.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.846
I said, "He was in the car
when they picked up Kiki?"

23:08.930 --> 23:10.598
He says, "Yes."

23:10.681 --> 23:17.146
Ah, I said to Godoy,
"Bastard, you sold me out."

23:18.314 --> 23:22.735
I was thinking, "I'm getting
fucked by these bastards."

23:22.819 --> 23:25.780
I said, "I really want him
real bad, Jorge. Please.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.782
"Go down there
and recruit him for me.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.242
Help me get this guy."

23:30.159 --> 23:34.664
We started to talk
and Hector told me,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.749
"If you tell me the truth,

23:38.376 --> 23:41.087
"I can help you.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.548
"But if you lie to me,

23:43.631 --> 23:46.384
I'm going to
take you down myself."

23:46.467 --> 23:48.010
BERRELLEZ: He said, "Okay.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.303
I'm gonna trust you.
I'll come up."

23:51.472 --> 23:55.434
LOPEZ:
When I arrived in Tijuana,

23:55.518 --> 24:00.898
at the border there were
around 20, 25 DEA agents.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.526
And I told my wife,

24:03.609 --> 24:08.239
"If they arrest me,
you all get out of here."

24:08.322 --> 24:12.243
I brought my wife as well
as my mother-in-law.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.291
They both started crying,

24:23.546 --> 24:26.841
and it was a real mess.

24:26.924 --> 24:30.887
But Hector calmed them down
and said, "No, no.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.431
Nothing will happen to him."

24:35.641 --> 24:39.145
One thing that
surprised me about René,
he was not a drinker.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.063
Not a drinker at all.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.942
This is a very concentrated
guy, very focused guy.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.569
He made me a little nervous,
actually.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.946
He looked like
a cold-blooded killer to me.

24:49.030 --> 24:52.241
You know, those--
that empty look in his eyes.

24:55.953 --> 25:00.166
BERRELLEZ: Six months later,
we recruit Ramón Lira,

25:00.249 --> 25:02.793
another eyewitness
to Kiki's murder.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.254
He was René and Godoy's boss.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.215
And he becomes
my third witness.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.678
I am all ears, man.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.489
MEDRANO:
When you're running a major
investigation like this,

25:31.572 --> 25:32.740
there's certain protocol,

25:32.823 --> 25:34.742
certain rules you gotta follow,

25:34.825 --> 25:38.537
so these informants are
kept apart every single day.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.748
They never mingle,
they never saw each other.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.500
They never
spoke to each other.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.293
They never read each other's
written statements.

25:44.377 --> 25:47.880
Because that's how you
preserve their credibility.

25:51.717 --> 25:56.555
So then begins a very lengthy
process to try to ascertain

25:56.639 --> 26:00.059
if this particular informant
is being candid with us.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.353
And here's how you do it.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.896
You're the informant.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.439
We sit down for
two hours today.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.066
Tell me everything
that you saw.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.734
Everything that happened.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.736
Who was present.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.114
I take copious notes.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.074
I say, "Okay, thanks.
We're gonna take a break.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.575
I'll see you in two days."

26:16.659 --> 26:19.370
Hector Berrellez
brings him back.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.622
We go through exactly
the same thing.

26:21.706 --> 26:25.001
Who was there?
Tell me what happened.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.087
We take another break.
I'll see you in a week.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.464
And this time, I don't
wanna go chronologically.

26:30.548 --> 26:32.341
Let me go to the very end.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.260
Okay, now, let's jump
to the beginning.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.678
And finally,
let's go to the middle part.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.929
Chapter Two.

26:37.013 --> 26:40.725
And if the story,
the statement,

26:40.808 --> 26:42.852
remains consistent throughout,

26:42.935 --> 26:45.146
then I believe
that informant.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.121
INTERVIEWER:
And when did you meet Fonseca

27:02.204 --> 27:03.873
for the first time?

27:03.956 --> 27:08.836
I met Ernesto Fonseca in 1984.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.546
Always in a suit.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.214
He was very well dressed.

27:12.298 --> 27:16.385
And he had nice cars
and good weapons.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.889
You really believed
he was a federal officer.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.808
When Fonseca was doing well,

27:22.892 --> 27:25.311
when he was not on drugs,

27:25.394 --> 27:29.190
he was a nice person.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.484
You could deal with him.

27:31.567 --> 27:34.904
One time
I went to his office,

27:34.987 --> 27:36.822
at the house code-named
"Restaurant One."

27:36.906 --> 27:40.368
I was so sleepy that
I lay down on the floor.

27:40.451 --> 27:43.496
Suddenly I heard Fonseca
open the door, so I jumped up.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.997
But he said,
"No, no, it's okay,

27:45.081 --> 27:47.375
calm down, calm down.
It's just me."

27:47.458 --> 27:49.585
Five minutes later,
Fonseca came back in

27:49.668 --> 27:52.338
and covered me with a blanket.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.594
GODOY:
The personality of
Caro Quintero and Fonseca,

27:58.677 --> 28:00.221
one was like a teenager,

28:00.304 --> 28:02.181
the other one an adult.

28:02.264 --> 28:07.269
Ernesto Fonseca, more
intelligent, older, sharper.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.771
And the other bastard,
Caro Quintero,

28:08.854 --> 28:10.856
dirtier, more impulsive,

28:10.940 --> 28:13.901
saying "I don't give a fuck,
fuck your mother,

28:13.984 --> 28:17.071
because I'm powerful
and strong."

28:17.154 --> 28:20.950
Caro Quintero had a saying:
"The cockroach!"

28:21.033 --> 28:23.577
"The cockroach!"

28:23.661 --> 28:26.705
And when he said,
"The cockroach!"

28:26.789 --> 28:31.752
that meant you had to do
what he told you, immediately.

28:31.836 --> 28:36.257
If he liked a lady
walking down the street,

28:36.340 --> 28:38.509
he would order us,
"Get her in the car."

28:38.592 --> 28:41.011
At first, the lady
was so scared,

28:41.095 --> 28:44.348
because we were basically
kidnapping her.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.477
But Caro was good at
calming and charming them.

28:49.562 --> 28:53.232
LIRA:
Fonseca used to tell us
the following:

28:53.315 --> 28:55.651
"When I'm resting,

28:55.734 --> 28:58.821
that's when I really
need you to protect me."

28:58.904 --> 29:00.531
INTERVIEWER:
He didn't sleep much, did he?

29:00.614 --> 29:01.907
Not at all, because of the
drugs.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.617
Day and night, he was high.

29:06.454 --> 29:07.955
They taught me how to make

29:08.038 --> 29:09.874
cocaine base cigarettes,

29:09.957 --> 29:12.835
so that I could stand next to
and give them to him,

29:12.918 --> 29:14.712
to my Master,

29:14.795 --> 29:17.590
to Mr. Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.179
One night I was guarding
Fonseca when he told me,

29:23.262 --> 29:26.724
"Be alert, important
people are coming."

29:27.266 --> 29:30.644
And two men arrived
who I recognized.

29:30.728 --> 29:35.399
One was the former president
Jose Lopez Portillo,

29:35.483 --> 29:38.277
and the other was President
Miguel de la Madrid.

29:39.361 --> 29:43.365
They went into a locked office
with my boss.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.994
I saw the three of them
together.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.706
They were drinking
and smoking freebase cocaine.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.837
LOPEZ:
We were driving in the car,

29:56.921 --> 29:59.089
Samuel was here,
Fonseca was driving,

29:59.173 --> 30:01.175
me and this other guy.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.885
And this guy was
arguing with Fonseca,

30:02.968 --> 30:04.803
they didn't get along.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.806
"Fuck your mother,
no you fuck your mother."

30:07.890 --> 30:10.351
Fonseca was in a bad mood.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.520
They kept arguing.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.980
And Ernesto Fonseca
slammed on the brakes.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.191
We all jolted.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.777
"I told you to shut
the fuck up, son of a bitch."

30:19.860 --> 30:23.531
And Fonseca points the gun
at him. Bang, bang, bang!

30:23.614 --> 30:26.951
He put three bullets
in his head.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.204
And Fonseca tells me,
"Open the door

30:30.287 --> 30:32.039
"and throw that fucking
bastard out of here.

30:32.122 --> 30:33.666
I don't want any trash here."

30:35.209 --> 30:37.044
Well, I opened the door

30:37.127 --> 30:40.506
and threw
"the fucking bastard" out.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.299
LIRA:
I have another story.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.093
On one occasion,

30:44.176 --> 30:46.262
Caro Quintero told me,

30:46.345 --> 30:49.056
"Hey look, let me
tell you something...

30:49.139 --> 30:52.560
"every two months or so

30:52.643 --> 30:54.478
"we send free kilos

30:54.562 --> 30:57.231
"to president Miguel
de la Madrid Hurtado,

30:57.314 --> 30:59.483
"the president of Mexico,

30:59.567 --> 31:02.194
we send him kilos of cocaine."

31:02.278 --> 31:04.905
That's what
Caro Quintero told me.

31:45.779 --> 31:49.575
MEDRANO: The drug cartel
felt they could do
whatever they want.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.994
And they did not take lightly
when, because of Camarena,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.663
they lost over a billion
dollars of marijuana

31:54.747 --> 31:57.541
seized at Bufalo Ranch
in Chihuahua.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.336
This massive,
extraordinary plantation

32:00.419 --> 32:02.379
of marijuana out in
the desert in Chihuahua

32:02.463 --> 32:03.964
in the middle of nowhere.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.382
And that was taken down.

32:07.760 --> 32:13.307
MIKA:
Kiki had discovered
that acreage of marijuana,

32:13.390 --> 32:18.604
and he kept telling
Mexico City, the embassy,

32:18.687 --> 32:22.608
and they said,
"We can't do anything
until you bring us evidence.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.276
We need pictures."

32:26.904 --> 32:31.408
I can assure you that if Kiki
hadn't taken those pictures,

32:31.492 --> 32:32.868
nothing would have happened.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.541
MEDRANO:
He was good at what he did.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.543
And he inflicted
tremendous pain,

32:41.627 --> 32:43.587
financial pain,
on the cartel.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.714
And they were not gonna
take that sitting down.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.466
And they didn't.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.100
INTERVIEWER: Where were you
when you found out

32:56.183 --> 32:58.852
about the Bufalo raid?

32:58.936 --> 33:02.064
We were all in the living room
with Ernesto Fonseca,

33:02.147 --> 33:04.108
then Caro Quintero arrived,

33:04.191 --> 33:06.193
and, he was really angry.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.320
"How the fuck did this happen?"

33:11.323 --> 33:14.535
He was so pissed off.
Because he had already
paid for-

33:14.618 --> 33:16.537
what he called, "his rights,"
for the plantation.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.999
Before he planted his crops
there in El Bufalo,

33:21.083 --> 33:23.210
before harvesting,

33:23.293 --> 33:25.546
he had already sent a portion

33:25.629 --> 33:28.173
to the president,
Miguel de la Madrid.

33:30.175 --> 33:34.596
Bartlett Diaz himself
came to collect the money.

33:35.597 --> 33:41.353
The part of the profits that
belonged to the President.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.855
INTERVIEWER:
And how do you know that?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.857
Because we all saw it.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.359
We were there when they were

33:47.443 --> 33:48.986
getting the boxes
of money ready.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.369
Caro Quintero was furious.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.037
He was hurt.

33:59.121 --> 34:02.875
Well, think about it,
it was his biggest crop.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.215
LIRA:
The DEA was already
on their minds

34:10.299 --> 34:12.342
before the Bufalo Raid,
because the DEA

34:12.426 --> 34:15.471
was hitting them
with seizures of money.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.640
They developed
a psychosis about the DEA-

34:18.724 --> 34:20.517
and the DEA coming after them.

34:20.601 --> 34:25.314
Any person who looked like
a gringo was from the DEA.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.566
So any gringo was in danger.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.067
Gringo or gringa.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.612
All of them, they
were from the DEA.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.791
MALE REPORTER:
Guadalajara has rustic beauty.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.710
But in recent months,
this city of 3.5 million

34:46.794 --> 34:50.422
has added something not found
on postcards or in brochures.

34:50.506 --> 34:54.343
Terror.
Seven Americans are missing.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.514
In December, Ben and Pat
Mascarenas of Nevada

34:58.597 --> 35:00.432
and Dennis and Rose Carlson
of California

35:00.516 --> 35:02.017
were abducted
in broad daylight

35:02.100 --> 35:04.603
in a rich suburb
of Guadalajara.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.563
All four are
Jehovah's Witnesses.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.656
GODOY:
They came doing their
God's mission.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.785
Knocking door to door.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.413
They knocked on the wrong door.

35:23.497 --> 35:27.626
The women were dressed
elegantly, the men in suits.

35:27.709 --> 35:31.380
Ramon Lira told Fonseca that

35:31.463 --> 35:35.551
two couples had come
and rung the doorbell.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.928
"Well, apparently
they were from the DEA."

35:38.011 --> 35:39.847
Because they were white.

35:39.930 --> 35:44.142
Fonseca said,
"What are you waiting for?

35:44.226 --> 35:46.353
"Why come to tell me?

35:46.436 --> 35:49.064
You already know
what you have to do."

35:49.147 --> 35:50.816
"Tie them up."

35:50.899 --> 35:53.193
By then, they had started
walking down the street,

35:53.277 --> 35:55.404
as if they sensed
something was wrong.

35:55.487 --> 35:59.324
But we cornered them
with one of our vans...

35:59.408 --> 36:02.119
And Samuel pulled
his gun on them.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.831
"We are police."

36:06.707 --> 36:09.960
Then Fonseca ordered me

36:10.043 --> 36:11.461
to interrogate them.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.463
"Let's see what
they know about

36:13.547 --> 36:16.884
"the police, the politicians,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.803
"about the CIA, the DEA.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.680
Ask them."

36:21.763 --> 36:26.476
It was a police-style
interrogation,

36:26.560 --> 36:29.563
writing down questions
and answers, all that.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.858
"Who are you investigating?
Who do you work for?"

36:32.941 --> 36:34.234
Both the women and the men

36:34.318 --> 36:36.028
said they were missionaries,

36:36.111 --> 36:39.323
who carried the word of God.

36:39.406 --> 36:42.034
INTERVIEWER:
And what did you think?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.785
I really believed them,

36:43.869 --> 36:45.871
because they were terrified.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.749
You could feel their fear.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.918
I thought, they are
telling the truth.

36:51.001 --> 36:54.755
And when I took my report
to Fonseca I told him,

36:54.838 --> 36:59.927
"Sir, these people
know nothing,
they're innocent."

37:00.010 --> 37:01.929
And Fonseca started laughing.

37:02.012 --> 37:05.724
They take them from that house
to some apartment,

37:05.807 --> 37:07.684
and they start torturing them.

37:07.768 --> 37:11.188
The women are raped
in front of the husbands.

37:11.271 --> 37:16.026
Then they're taken to
a ranch where the women
are repeatedly raped again.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.946
And the women
are being tortured

37:19.029 --> 37:20.656
by running a rope
between their legs.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.033
Their vaginas are bleeding.

37:24.534 --> 37:28.455
LOPEZ:
And when Los Dormidos arrived,

37:28.538 --> 37:30.248
Samuel Ramirez told them,

37:30.332 --> 37:32.668
"There are four people there

37:32.751 --> 37:35.128
that you must
take to the graveyard."

37:47.349 --> 37:50.143
They were crying,
they were screaming...

37:50.227 --> 37:53.605
They brought them down
one by one,

37:53.689 --> 37:58.276
and right near
the edge of the well,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.988
they shot them all,
and they fell down.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.573
One by one.

38:08.412 --> 38:11.415
And that's the story of
the Jehovah's Witnesses.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.466
BERRELLEZ:
There was another occasion

38:21.550 --> 38:23.760
where two tourists
that had walked into...

38:23.844 --> 38:26.304
La Langosta restaurant,

38:26.388 --> 38:29.474
a seafood restaurant
owned by Rafael Caro Quintero.

38:29.725 --> 38:36.523
Only high-quality seafood,
fresh, special,

38:36.606 --> 38:41.028
for the Narcos,
for government people...

38:43.196 --> 38:45.949
BERRELLEZ:
Caro Quintero was there,
Fonseca was there,

38:46.033 --> 38:47.659
and they're all celebrating.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.537
LIRA:
I saw a table in the center.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.497
I sat down there.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.750
And after a while,
Caro Quintero arrived.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.210
"I want you to stay
very alert," he told me.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.422
Then two people arrived.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.673
BERRELLEZ:
One is John Walker.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.302
The other one
is Alberto Radelat.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.304
They're both from Texas.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.222
GODOY:
And Caro told me,

39:09.306 --> 39:11.683
"Tell them it's closed,
tell them to go away."

39:11.767 --> 39:14.186
So I went to the entrance
to tell them,

39:14.269 --> 39:15.812
"Sorry, it's closed, go away."

39:15.896 --> 39:18.940
They started to speak
only in English.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.110
LIRA:
Caro Quintero
has an excellent ear,

39:22.194 --> 39:25.322
Fonseca, all the Narcos
have good ears,

39:25.405 --> 39:26.907
exceptional ears.

39:26.990 --> 39:30.035
I'm sorry. It's closed.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.746
You have to go. Please go.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.123
Get out of Here.
You have to leave. Go.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.918
LOPEZ:
And then El Chapo
started to yell,

39:38.794 --> 39:41.463
"Those gringos,
they are from the DEA!"

39:41.963 --> 39:44.883
These guys are not DEA.
They're just a couple
of tourists.

39:45.383 --> 39:49.304
GODOY:
They had already
turned around,

39:49.387 --> 39:51.306
and had started to
walk away.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.434
LIRA:
Then Caro Quintero and I
went to the door.

39:54.518 --> 39:58.021
He grabbed one man,
I grabbed the other.

39:58.105 --> 40:01.691
We pinned them
against some coolers

40:01.775 --> 40:05.153
that were
next to the kitchen.

40:05.237 --> 40:09.032
Caro Quintero jammed one man

40:09.116 --> 40:11.118
face down against the ice.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.577
I put the other one down.

40:14.788 --> 40:18.416
♪ Beautiful adobe
country home ♪

40:18.500 --> 40:21.920
♪ Its door made of oak
and mesquite ♪

40:25.048 --> 40:28.468
That was the song
that the band was playing.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.929
"Make some noise,
you bastards."

40:32.139 --> 40:35.934
BERRELLEZ:
El Chapo Guzmán,
a coward, the psychopath,

40:36.017 --> 40:38.145
he starts bone tickling him
with ice picks...

40:38.228 --> 40:41.106
trying to get him
to admit they're DEA.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.484
LOPEZ:
So then, fucking Caro Quintero
got really excited.

40:44.568 --> 40:47.445
"You pricks,
are you from the DEA?"

40:47.529 --> 40:49.322
He grabbed one by the hair
and began to stab him

40:49.406 --> 40:51.032
in the head with an ice pick.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.119
Then El Chapo told Caro,
"Give me the ice pick!"

40:54.870 --> 40:57.122
And El Chapo grabbed him
this way by the hair

40:57.205 --> 41:00.584
and cut his throat with it.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.253
Caro Quintero pistol whipped

41:03.336 --> 41:05.338
the second man in the head.

41:05.422 --> 41:09.593
LIRA:
He hit him so hard
that he broke his gun.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.721
He broke it on
the guy's skull.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.433
The gun was covered
with rubies, diamonds.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.351
It had "R1" written on it.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.312
That was our code name
for Caro Quintero.

41:20.395 --> 41:24.232
If I had protested,
I would have died with them.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.822
LIRA:
My clothes were
covered in blood.

41:30.906 --> 41:32.282
I grabbed him,

41:32.365 --> 41:36.411
and I felt his body go slack.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.165
That was when I realized
he was already dead.

41:40.540 --> 41:44.586
GODOY:
The word started
to spread outside

41:44.669 --> 41:46.379
that they had
killed the gringos.

41:46.463 --> 41:49.507
Bunch of fucking
murderers and cowards,

41:49.591 --> 41:53.511
celebrating and shooting
with their AK-47s,

41:54.763 --> 42:00.060
celebrating like they had done

42:00.143 --> 42:02.187
a great thing.

42:04.731 --> 42:09.778
BERRELLEZ:
They decapitate them,
they dismember them,

42:09.861 --> 42:11.821
then they wrap their
bodies in tablecloths.

42:12.572 --> 42:15.909
LOPEZ:
And that was when
"Los Dormidos" showed up

42:15.992 --> 42:18.495
and El Chapo helped
to take the bodies away.

42:18.578 --> 42:19.871
And they buried them
in La Primavera forest.

42:21.581 --> 42:25.877
That was the second time
El Chapo Guzman beat me.

42:35.387 --> 42:38.765
MALE REPORTER:
Eve Walker remains determined
to find her husband...

42:38.848 --> 42:40.642
dead or alive.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.519
MALE REPORTER:
For the families,

42:42.602 --> 42:44.562
their emotional suffering
reached its peak

42:44.646 --> 42:46.273
when they identified
the two bodies

42:46.356 --> 42:48.692
at the decaying
Guadalajara morgue.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.569
Yesterday, police led the
families to a remote forest

42:51.653 --> 42:54.990
outside Guadalajara to examine
the site where the bodies
were buried.

42:55.073 --> 42:59.119
At the bottom of the grave,
the families had placed
a makeshift wreath.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.213
JORDAN:
Prior to Kiki being kidnapped,

43:10.297 --> 43:13.633
Caro Quintero Fonseca

43:13.717 --> 43:15.135
and Gallardo

43:15.218 --> 43:18.596
had already killed
seven Americans.

43:18.680 --> 43:23.101
Each time, Caro Quintero,
in his own mind, thought,

43:23.184 --> 43:27.105
"Oh, there's another DEA agent
at the door. Get him."

43:27.188 --> 43:33.111
And these poor innocents
were murdered

43:33.194 --> 43:35.447
and tortured
and everything else.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.657
But the government
didn't get involved.

43:37.741 --> 43:41.745
So then that makes...

43:41.828 --> 43:43.913
Caro Quintero think that...

43:43.997 --> 43:49.294
he's got a license
to kill DEA agents.

43:49.377 --> 43:53.757
And then when
Kiki was murdered,

43:53.840 --> 43:55.759
then they found out
who we were.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.306
INTERVIEWER: When and where
do you meet the witnesses,

44:01.389 --> 44:04.225
and what's your take on 'em?

44:04.309 --> 44:08.063
JORDAN: I met those three
individuals in California.

44:08.146 --> 44:12.108
I interviewed them
individually.

44:12.192 --> 44:13.610
And I told Hector,

44:13.693 --> 44:16.279
"These guys are
telling the truth."

44:16.363 --> 44:18.531
It dawned on me, you know,

44:18.615 --> 44:20.992
for the very first time,

44:21.076 --> 44:23.828
I'm hearing what
really happened to Kiki.

44:23.912 --> 44:28.500
For the very first time,
the DEA is gonna get a glimpse

44:28.583 --> 44:30.668
of who interrogated Kiki,

44:30.752 --> 44:32.879
how they interrogated him,

44:32.962 --> 44:34.422
and how he was tortured.

44:39.302 --> 44:42.389
LOPEZ:
I sat down with Hector
and we started talking.

44:44.099 --> 44:46.559
Hector told me,
"I know that you were there.

44:46.643 --> 44:49.354
"And I want you
to talk to me.

44:49.437 --> 44:50.772
Can you do it?"

44:50.855 --> 44:53.274
I said, "Yes."

44:53.358 --> 44:55.610
"I have the story from
the very beginning...

44:55.693 --> 44:57.821
until Kiki's death."

45:01.324 --> 45:04.035
GODOY:
We have to clarify
everything, name by name,

45:04.119 --> 45:06.037
one by one,

45:06.121 --> 45:08.665
both Mexico's government,

45:08.748 --> 45:10.333
and the United States
government.

45:13.837 --> 45:18.258
Rafael Caro Quintero,
this message is for you.

45:18.341 --> 45:19.968
And for you,
Miguel Felix Gallardo.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.720
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo,
for you too.

45:24.139 --> 45:27.392
We are ready,
and we are going all in,

45:27.475 --> 45:30.854
you fucking assholes.

45:32.021 --> 45:35.442
And I'm ready to die.
