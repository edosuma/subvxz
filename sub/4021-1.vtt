even a second time, I don't get why.

07:55.633 --> 07:58.562
You're leaving? Just like that?

07:58.563 --> 08:00.155
Why are they making you do this?

08:00.156 --> 08:01.901
They're not making me. It's my choice.

that I could stay here with my grandfather
for the first part of high school.

08:39.527 --> 08:42.136
Then, when it was time to get
serious, I would leave with my Aunt

Let's go.

30:27.913 --> 30:32.928
We's not gonna let a bunch of waterlogged
wash-outs spoil our very fine evening.

30:32.929 --> 30:36.496
Big Momma's is like a second home
to me... if I had a first one.

30:36.497 --> 30:38.848
I popped my first wheelie in here.

30:38.849 --> 30:41.180
Hey, did you see that
surfer dude eyeballin' you?

30:41.181 --> 30:45.561
Yeah, I saw him. I saw him, all right.

30:45.967 --> 30:49.106
- Sodas for everyone.
- Thanks, sis.

30:49.107 --> 30:51.967
Those surfers weren't
bothering you, were they?

30:51.968 --> 30:54.348
No, of course not.

30:54.349 --> 30:56.516
They're not so, bad.

30:56.517 --> 30:58.102
All surfers is bad.

30:58.103 --> 30:59.999
Yeah, all surfers is bad.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.856
Except for the ones that are very bad.

31:01.857 --> 31:03.640
They're even worse.

31:03.641 --> 31:05.861
[Laughter]

31:12.468 --> 31:15.339
Ooh, it's almost time.
Let's go, let's go.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.537
Hey, Big Momma, you sure know
how to fry up a fish burger.

31:18.538 --> 31:23.338
If you can catch it,
Big Momma can cook it!

31:24.150 --> 31:27.060
Ooh, shake a tail feather.

31:27.061 --> 31:28.442
Ha ha ha!

31:28.443 --> 31:31.623
Oh, boy, I gotta cook.

31:42.191 --> 31:45.198

31:45.199 --> 31:48.676

I'm sorry, but I'm worried.

32:39.188 --> 32:41.105
I don't have time to
wait around for the storm.

32:41.106 --> 32:43.937
I'm gonna head back to the beach
and try and figure a way out of here.

32:43.938 --> 32:45.281
No, Mack, remember?

32:45.282 --> 32:47.673
This is the part of the movie
we saw at your grandfather's,

32:47.674 --> 32:49.842
where the two leads get together.

32:49.843 --> 32:55.743
You enjoy it. I'll let you
know if I come up with anything.

You saved my life.

33:30.123 --> 33:32.156
Not really.

33:32.157 --> 33:36.441
The stage is, like, two feet up. The
worst you would've done is broken a nail.

33:36.442 --> 33:40.762
I guess I literally fell for you, huh?

33:41.284 --> 33:43.385
I'm Lela.

33:43.386 --> 33:45.486
I know.

33:46.171 --> 33:48.135
I mean...

33:48.136 --> 33:51.436
Yeah, you are. I mean...

33:51.498 --> 33:54.378
I've dreamed about this since
I was, like, in fifth grade.

33:54.379 --> 33:56.230
Who are you?

33:56.231 --> 33:59.845
Brady, Knight in shining board shorts.

33:59.846 --> 34:03.254
That's a really long last name.

34:03.255 --> 34:05.122
Nice of you to drop in.

34:05.123 --> 34:08.225
Um, sorry. I didn't see you.

34:08.226 --> 34:12.966
Now that you do, do
you like what you see?

34:13.447 --> 34:16.416
Sure. [Clears throat]

34:16.417 --> 34:19.090
It's really nice to meet you.

34:19.091 --> 34:22.004
Excuse me for just one second.

34:22.005 --> 34:26.641
Brady, can I have a moment? A
really quick, important moment.

34:26.643 --> 34:28.413
Excuse me, Lela.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.393
Okay.

34:29.395 --> 34:32.766
It was really great falling into you.

34:32.768 --> 34:35.541
I hope we can do it again sometime.

34:35.542 --> 34:40.266
The mannequin with six rows
of teeth just asked me out.

34:40.266 --> 34:41.440
Mack, something's not right.

34:41.442 --> 34:43.348
We could write a list of
things that aren't right,

34:43.349 --> 34:45.161
starting with the fact that there
are enough things to write a list.

34:45.163 --> 34:47.563
Look around.

34:48.166 --> 34:49.733
Nothing's happening. It's almost...

34:49.734 --> 34:51.579
It's almost dull.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.860
Okay. And?

34:54.092 --> 34:57.517
Okay, so when Lela sings that song about
finding the perfect boy and being happy...

34:57.518 --> 34:58.744
See, that's exactly my point.

34:58.745 --> 35:01.250
- Why does she need a boy to be happy?
- Because it's 1962.

35:01.251 --> 35:02.971
The thing is, after she sings that song,

35:02.972 --> 35:06.250
it's Tanner who's supposed to
catch her as he's walking by.

35:06.251 --> 35:08.677
Okay, what happens right
after he catches her?

35:08.678 --> 35:14.578
They fall instantly in love, but are pulled
apart, and a full-on dance war breaks out.

35:18.180 --> 35:23.700
It's almost like nobody
knows exactly what to do next.

35:26.912 --> 35:30.372
Lela and Tanner were supposed
to fall into each other's arms,

35:30.373 --> 35:33.477
find love, and then are
pulled apart by a turf war.

35:33.478 --> 35:34.730
That's how the movie's written?

35:34.731 --> 35:37.561
But instead, they fell into our
arms, and now, they're into us.

35:37.562 --> 35:39.856
- And there's no turf war.
- Right.

35:39.857 --> 35:42.819
So we changed the movie.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.872
- We changed the movie.
- We changed the movie!

35:44.873 --> 35:46.872
- Yeah.
- Do you think it will affect anything?

35:46.873 --> 35:51.095
It affected who they fell for. Who
knows what else it could affect.

35:51.096 --> 35:52.522
Okay, okay...

35:52.523 --> 35:54.394
Brady, you said that
there's a storm at the end

35:54.395 --> 35:56.312
of the movie that we
can ride out of here on.

35:56.313 --> 36:00.213
Yeah, three days after they meet.

36:00.935 --> 36:02.004
[Clears throat]

36:02.005 --> 36:05.090
I'm gonna ask you something,
even though I know and,

36:05.091 --> 36:07.470
I know you know, I don't wanna know.

36:07.471 --> 36:10.173
Is there anything that happens
in the next three days that could,

36:10.174 --> 36:13.534
somehow affect that storm?

36:17.624 --> 36:19.390
See. Didn't wanna know.

36:19.391 --> 36:22.226
If you're looking for this to make
sense, you're on the wrong beach.

36:22.227 --> 36:25.589
I'm looking to see if Les Camembert is
building his diabolical weather machine.

36:25.590 --> 36:27.310
How often do you hear that sentence?

36:27.311 --> 36:29.895
Remember, I told you about the
maniacal real estate developer?

36:29.896 --> 36:30.976
Or that one.

36:30.977 --> 36:34.592
Les Camembert knows this beachfront
property will be gold someday.

36:34.593 --> 36:38.808
So he tells Big Momma to sell it to him
so he can build an overpriced resort.

36:38.809 --> 36:39.816
She says no.

36:39.817 --> 36:42.433
Of course she does,
or there'd be no movie.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.433
- It gets better.
- I can't wait.

36:45.434 --> 36:48.974
Let's just stop right here.

36:51.306 --> 36:54.540
No way. It's the Camembert hideout.

36:54.541 --> 36:57.481
Let's go. Come on.

37:06.104 --> 37:07.482
This is it.

37:07.483 --> 37:10.363
How do we get in?

37:16.887 --> 37:18.807
Boom.

37:21.153 --> 37:24.504
Les: You know, I've dreamed of a scheme
like this every since I was a mere lad,

37:24.505 --> 37:27.422
conning my school fellows
out of their lunch money.

37:27.423 --> 37:29.857
Lunch? How about takeout?

37:29.858 --> 37:31.120
That's him.

37:31.121 --> 37:34.365
He's all British and proper,
but he's from Pittsburgh.

37:34.366 --> 37:37.468
- Who's that with him?
- [Evil laughter]

37:37.469 --> 37:39.203
What are they building?

37:39.204 --> 37:42.625
Desperate to get Big Momma's, Les
Camembert hires a mad scientist,

37:42.626 --> 37:46.143
Dr. Fusion, to carry
out his diabolical idea.

37:46.144 --> 37:48.964
Come on, come on.

37:50.448 --> 37:52.249
What is that?

37:52.250 --> 37:57.410
Les Camembert's diabolical
weather altering machine.

37:58.456 --> 38:00.879
Yes, yes, yes.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.407
Manual...

38:02.408 --> 38:07.868
This thing's almost built.
Shouldn't you be off book?

38:08.278 --> 38:12.155
This machine will so drastically
change the weather patterns,

38:12.156 --> 38:16.505
it will literally still the
oceans so there's no longer surf.

38:16.506 --> 38:18.935
It'll create humidity so dense,

38:18.936 --> 38:23.347
it'll rust every piece off of
those shiny chrome machines.

38:23.348 --> 38:26.119
The surfers will leave to
find a new spot to surf,

38:26.120 --> 38:30.298
the bikers won't come near this
area ever again, and I shall triumph.

38:30.299 --> 38:32.423
Triumph, I say!

38:32.424 --> 38:34.815
You will have the last laugh.

38:34.816 --> 38:37.343
Yes. I've always been rather
wary of the last laugh.

38:37.344 --> 38:39.178
What if it was only moderately funny?

38:39.179 --> 38:41.666
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.141
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

38:44.142 --> 38:45.135
Ha ha.

38:45.136 --> 38:47.617
- Ha ha...
- Hah!

38:47.618 --> 38:51.638
And this thing never won an Oscar.

38:51.783 --> 38:53.792
Mack. Wait, wait.

38:53.793 --> 38:56.964
In the movie, Lela and
Tanner discover Les' plan.

38:56.965 --> 38:59.115
They unite the surfers and bikers,

38:59.116 --> 39:01.958
and destroy the machine,
which ends in an explosion.

39:01.959 --> 39:03.258
That's what creates the storm.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.118
So if Lela and Tanner
don't get back together,

39:05.119 --> 39:08.216
which would put the movie back on track
the way it's supposed to play out...

39:08.217 --> 39:10.446
The chain of events that
create that storm won't happen.

39:10.447 --> 39:15.199
And we'll be stuck
here and never get home.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.249
Don't worry.

39:16.250 --> 39:19.310
We'll figure it out.

39:21.139 --> 39:25.519
Butchy, it's cold. Give me your jacket.

39:27.345 --> 39:30.981
Oh, thanks again,
Brady, for catching me.

39:30.982 --> 39:33.083
You know, these are...

39:33.084 --> 39:34.312
[Gasps]

39:34.313 --> 39:36.412
Oh, bunkers. Are you two together?

39:36.413 --> 39:38.290
I would never take another girl's boy.

39:38.291 --> 39:42.159
I mean that would be stealing,
and probably very hard to return.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.895
Uh, no, we're not together.

39:44.896 --> 39:50.116
I mean, we're together,
but we're not... together.

39:51.501 --> 39:54.298
Lela, this is McKenzie.

39:54.299 --> 39:58.134
So you wouldn't mind if Brady
took me for a walk on the beach?

39:58.135 --> 39:59.935
No.

40:00.029 --> 40:02.186
Please. Beaches are
meant to be walked on.

40:02.187 --> 40:06.387
That's why they're called... beaches.

40:07.061 --> 40:09.156
You guys are strange.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.255
I like that.

40:11.256 --> 40:14.430
Um, meet me by the water, Brady.

40:14.431 --> 40:18.391
Oh, it is very nice to meet you.

40:19.331 --> 40:20.718
I don't get it.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.783
Okay, first, you break up with me,

40:22.784 --> 40:24.809
but then, you throw me in
the arms of someone else?

40:24.810 --> 40:26.115
She's crushing on you.

40:26.116 --> 40:27.438
I like you.

40:27.439 --> 40:33.110
And until you go off to that school,
I'm not gonna like anyone else but you.

40:33.111 --> 40:34.649
The way I like you.

40:34.650 --> 40:39.629
You're not seeing what's
right in front of you.

40:39.630 --> 40:41.713
You're right in front of me.

40:41.714 --> 40:47.614
I can explain it to you, Brady,
but I can't understand it for you.

40:50.395 --> 40:53.148
So the way to get her to like him,

40:53.149 --> 40:57.976
is for me to deflect her
affections off of me and on to him.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.846
I really hope so.

40:59.847 --> 41:02.390
I'm gonna do the same with Tanner.

41:02.391 --> 41:03.693
All right.

41:03.694 --> 41:09.594
I'll be back as soon as I can
get that smokin' girl to hate me.

41:16.105 --> 41:18.505
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:18.741 --> 41:20.128
Um, do you mind if I join you?

41:20.129 --> 41:24.509
Of course not. I'd wanna join me, too.

41:24.662 --> 41:29.822
So, hey, I've never seen
a chick quite like you.

41:29.873 --> 41:31.413
Chick? Really?

41:31.414 --> 41:33.582
Hold on while I lay some eggs.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.314
Okay.

41:35.315 --> 41:38.255
No, that was, um...

41:38.644 --> 41:41.512
Never mind. Thank you
for the compliment.

41:41.513 --> 41:43.073
It's nice.

41:43.074 --> 41:44.381
Sure.

41:44.382 --> 41:49.000
So, Lela, how come you bikers
don't get along with the surfers?

41:49.001 --> 41:52.818
Well, it's always been like that.

41:52.819 --> 41:55.088
We're not supposed to
have a lot in common.

41:55.089 --> 41:57.514
Plus, we both want Big Momma's.

41:57.515 --> 42:02.883
Some of them seem pretty cool,
like, um, that guy Tanner.

42:02.884 --> 42:08.784
It was very courageous of you to charge
the stage like that, and save my life.

42:08.785 --> 42:11.965
Courageous? No, no, no.

42:14.715 --> 42:16.695
Maybe.

42:16.871 --> 42:19.719
I mean, I'm sure anyone
would've done the same.

42:19.720 --> 42:22.300
Even a surfer.

42:22.891 --> 42:25.591
You're my hero.

42:25.682 --> 42:27.602
Hero?
