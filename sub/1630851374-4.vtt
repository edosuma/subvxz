00:11.620 --> 00:13.361
Hello?MICHAEL [over phone]:
Hi.

00:13.404 --> 00:16.146
Oh, th-thank God you answered.Who's this?

00:16.190 --> 00:18.061
Oh, um, m-my name's Michael,

00:18.105 --> 00:20.063
and, uh,
I'm-I'm a friend of, uh--

00:20.107 --> 00:22.022
sort of-- of-of Lorri Benson's.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.546
I don't know a Lorri Benson.MICHAEL:
Your number was in her phone.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.244
[phone vibrates][sighs]

00:27.288 --> 00:29.029
Stop calling me.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.465
I said I don't know...TREY [over phone]:
Darnell. Darnell.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.380
Hey, man, it's Trey.
I just spoke to Josiah

00:32.423 --> 00:34.947
And he wants to see you
right away.What?

00:38.864 --> 00:40.257
[sighs]

00:40.301 --> 00:41.476
All right. Yeah, yeah.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.610
You can go in.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.831
JOSIAH:
Jessica claims she has no way
of getting in touch with Murphy.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.006
So, that's where you come in.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.790
Can't you just...

00:51.834 --> 00:53.792
Please let her go.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.142
You promised me

00:55.185 --> 00:57.666
if I got you Nia's guys,
you'd protect them.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.971
That was before I found out

00:59.015 --> 01:00.843
she skimmed 50 bricks
off the stash.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.498
They didn't skim. They were in
the middle of getting the stash,

01:03.541 --> 01:05.282
heard the sirens
a-and had to bail

01:05.326 --> 01:07.284
before they could
get everything.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.112
All I know

01:09.156 --> 01:11.767
is that I'm out $300,000.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.900
And if your little friends
don't compensate me, well, then,

01:14.944 --> 01:17.686
I kill the girl in the basement.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.735
Here you go.

01:25.824 --> 01:29.741
Come on. I'm supposed
to make sure you eat.

CINDY [over phone]:
Hello?Hey, Cindy.

01:59.902 --> 02:02.948
It's Darnell. Look, I sent you
some people the other day.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.385
Can I get their new names?

02:04.428 --> 02:05.995
Why don't you ask Josiah?

02:06.038 --> 02:07.866
His guys held me at gunpoint
for them.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.652
Oh, my God. I'm... I'm so sorry.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.219
Look, I just...

02:12.262 --> 02:13.785
I really need to find them,

02:13.829 --> 02:16.310
and I can't find them
without the names they're using.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.790
Please, Cindy.Ugh, all right.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.749
Kyle Green,

02:20.792 --> 02:23.143
Jennifer Walker, Gordon Howard

02:23.186 --> 02:24.970
and Lorri Benson.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.625
Wait. Did you say Lorri Benson?

02:27.669 --> 02:28.931
Yeah.

02:28.974 --> 02:32.239
[sighs] Okay. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.372
[phone buzzing]

02:36.504 --> 02:38.375
Hello?DARNELL: Hey.

02:38.419 --> 02:41.117
Uh, you called me earlier
about Lorri?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.945
Yeah. I thought you said
you didn't know her.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.208
Yeah. Well, uh, turns out I do.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.514
You know where she is?

02:46.557 --> 02:47.602
Yeah, that's what
I was trying to tell you.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.125
She's stuck
on the side of the road.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.561
What? Where?

02:50.605 --> 02:53.347
Um, o-on Route 11.
Just outside of Rainy River.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.350
That is, if she hasn't already
hitched a ride or something.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.221
Okay. I will go get her.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.571
You tell me
exactly where she is.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.182
Okay.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.271
They fled to Canada.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.707
I can go there
and get the money,

03:05.750 --> 03:08.144
but you got to give me
another couple days.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.624
Fine.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.191
Trey, go with him.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.844
You said
I could trust him.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.107
Let's see
if you were right.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.676
[sighs]Seriously?

03:18.720 --> 03:22.158
What?You don't want to
hang with me no more?

03:23.725 --> 03:24.813
[sighs]

03:24.856 --> 03:27.119
They don't have
the money, do they?

03:27.163 --> 03:28.991
No, they don't.
But I got a plan.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.602
Oh, you got a plan. Cool.
'Cause all your plans

03:31.646 --> 03:33.256
have turned out perfectly
well in the past.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.605
Look, Murphy's friend Felix

03:34.649 --> 03:36.085
knows Nia's
bank account numbers.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.695
I know her passwords.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.263
So, if we can get to Felix,
we can empty her accounts.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.265
And how do we get to Felix?Murphy's stuck

03:42.309 --> 03:43.571
on the side of the road
in Canada,

03:43.614 --> 03:45.268
so if we can get to her,
we can get to him.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.617
Stuck on the side
of the road?

03:46.661 --> 03:48.097
How do you know
she's still there?I don't.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.142
But the kid Michael said
it's a pretty abandoned road,

03:50.186 --> 03:52.710
so hopefully, no one's..."Hopefully"?
You sound crazy right now.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.625
Look, you don't have to come.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.714
Actually, I do.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.368
You heard Josiah.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.849
I'm just as much
on the hook for this as you are.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.329
Because I
stupidly vouched for you.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.461
I know how much money Nia has.
It's all good.

04:04.505 --> 04:07.682
Just figure out
how to get to Rainy River,

04:07.725 --> 04:08.987
wherever that is.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.947
Come on. Let's go.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.950
[engine starts]

04:20.608 --> 04:22.784
[vehicle approaching]

04:28.398 --> 04:30.357
Hey!

04:30.400 --> 04:33.621
Please help me! Stop, please!

04:33.664 --> 04:35.971
[horn honks]

04:36.014 --> 04:37.668
Oh, thank God.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.061
It's me, Darnell.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.498
Darnell?It's about Jess.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.631
MURPHY:
Is she okay?

04:43.674 --> 04:48.244
Yeah. As long as we get
him the cash by Friday.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.464
That's tomorrow.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.554
Don't worry.
Julian Assange over here

04:53.597 --> 04:55.033
is gonna hack
into Nia's bank account

04:55.077 --> 04:56.470
and steal all the money.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.950
Which is obviously
a great plan.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.909
We found Murphy, didn't we?

05:00.952 --> 05:03.390
Look, I just need to get Felix
to give us the account numbers.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.174
I don't know where he is.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.307
Wait, what?I don't know where he is.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.744
We... [exhales]
We agreed to split up

05:09.787 --> 05:11.354
so that if one of us
got caught...

05:11.398 --> 05:13.182
Okay, do you have his number?

05:13.225 --> 05:15.140
No. It's in my phone.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.794
You have it memorized or...No.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.493
It's not...You heard the girl.
She said it's in her phone.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.973
Don't call me "the girl."
I have a name.TREY: I'm not really

05:22.017 --> 05:24.106
gonna get caught up in the
pleasantries right now, shorty.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.238
What we're trying to do
is figure..."Shorty"?

05:26.282 --> 05:27.152
Guys.Yes.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.328
I'm very tall.Guys. Guys!

05:28.371 --> 05:29.590
I'll text the kid
and get the number.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.549
That's fine, but I still need
to get my phone.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.116
Why?Why?

05:34.159 --> 05:36.074
I need it
in case Jess tries to call me.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.946
Trust me,
Jess is not gonna call you.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.251
I don't care. I need it.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.558
Okay. All right. Look...

05:41.602 --> 05:43.734
This is stupid.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.214
I'm-a need a break.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.911
Trey.What?

05:46.955 --> 05:48.260
Trey![door closes]

05:48.304 --> 05:50.175
What is his problem?
That guy sucks.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.960
Don't say that. That's my boy.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.093
I'm sorry, Darnell,
but I need my phone.

05:55.137 --> 05:58.619
I need my phone. That's the
only link that Jess has to me.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.969
All right, all right.
I texted Michael.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.537
MURPHY:
Okay, get in the car.
You can have

06:03.580 --> 06:06.017
your temper tantrum in the car.
We're leaving.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.411
Who you talking to?We're leaving. Ten.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.848
Nine. Eight.You talking to me?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.205
You Michael?Yeah.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.424
Hi.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.949
Lorri. Uh, l-listen,
I am so sorry, okay?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.560
I-I didn't mean
to leave you back there, okay?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.127
It's fine. J-Just...
Can I just have my phone?

06:29.171 --> 06:31.826
It's just my mom was nice to me
for, like, the first time

06:31.869 --> 06:35.482
ever, really,
and-and I just couldn't...Brah! Just give us the phone.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.005
Sorry. Um...

06:37.048 --> 06:39.181
Look, there. Look,
I put a new SIM card

06:39.224 --> 06:40.878
in it, so it should work here.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.707
TREY:Let's hope your boy Felix
did the same thing.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.797
You're a good kid, Michael.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.495
See you.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.113
[slot machines chiming]

06:58.156 --> 06:59.462

06:59.506 --> 07:00.942
Still going to voice mail.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.334
Well, keep trying.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.119
And what are we even doing here?
We're wasting time.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.816
We just need to regroup
for a couple hours.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.862
Figure out a plan.Oh, why?
'Cause poor baby Trey

07:07.905 --> 07:09.951
was getting carsick?
He didn't feel good?No.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.822
Does your tummy hurt?No, actually. I'm completely
fine. I just don't think

07:11.866 --> 07:13.650
there's a point to
driving around aimlessly.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.130
Do you think
that's a good idea?I'm gonna get us a room.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.523
If you think that's a
good idea, I'm down.Murphy.

07:16.566 --> 07:17.915
I'm gonna get us a room.
Murphy, keep trying Felix.

07:21.223 --> 07:24.487
Call speed dial one.

07:42.636 --> 07:47.075
MAN:
Head on within 50 feet
of the premises.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.643
I'm on break.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.046
[chuckles]

08:04.832 --> 08:06.094
Hey. I thought

08:06.137 --> 08:08.662
we weren't supposed
to be calling each other.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.861
Okay. Yeah,
this could work.

08:33.904 --> 08:37.342
I mean, Guiding Hope moved
at least $2 million last month.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.909
You have the passwords?

08:38.953 --> 08:40.607
Yeah. I have to try
a few combos,

08:40.650 --> 08:41.999
but I know I can get it.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.654
Yeah? Okay. This could work.
I think this could work.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.743
Why is your guy
wearing tights?

08:46.787 --> 08:48.615
[chuckles]

08:48.658 --> 08:50.834
Felix? He-He's
wearing tights?

08:50.878 --> 08:53.445
I'm not wearing tights.
I'm wearing leggings.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.447
Uh, I didn't have time
to change out of my...

08:55.491 --> 08:58.233
co... uh, uniform.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.582
Okay? For work.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.714
MURPHY:
Where are you working?

09:00.757 --> 09:02.324
And how did you
already get a job?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.760
FELIX:
It doesn't matter.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.763
Maybe we should have a little
sidebar outside, Murphy?

09:06.807 --> 09:09.723
Just you and me?
Just a little hallway sidebar?

09:09.766 --> 09:11.681
Right now?Yeah.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.640
Stay, Pretzel.

09:13.683 --> 09:16.164
FELIX:
Sorry, guys. Back in two secs.[door opens]

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
[sighs, chuckles]

09:23.519 --> 09:25.129
Oh, you have a, uh...

09:25.173 --> 09:26.740
Oh! Sorry. I'm so sorry.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.959
I should've told
you I was gonna...What is... What is it?

09:29.003 --> 09:31.135
You j... You
had a tendril.What's up?

09:31.179 --> 09:33.877
Uh...
[chuckles]

09:33.921 --> 09:36.706
What? What do you
mean? Oh, I mean...

09:36.750 --> 09:39.013
No, I just wanted to
make sure, like, we're...

09:39.056 --> 09:41.537
Are we, like... You know,
you and me, like, we're...

09:41.581 --> 09:42.886
Is it cool? Is
everything fine?

09:42.930 --> 09:45.019
Between us?What do you mean?

09:45.062 --> 09:46.629
Uh...

09:46.673 --> 09:49.110
Like,
last time we saw each other

09:49.153 --> 09:52.635
was at the motel.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.507
Together.
[chuckles softly]

09:55.551 --> 09:58.467
Honestly, I haven't... I haven't
even thought about it once.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.077
[chuckles]:
Like, I-I... forgot.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.775
We're fine. We're fine.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.038
Come on.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.344
Okay, cool.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.564
Good.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.611
DARNELL:I found a library a
couple miles from here

10:11.654 --> 10:14.004
with computers.
We can do the transfer there.[door closes]

10:14.048 --> 10:15.527
Let's go.FELIX:
No need.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.269
I have a laptop in my car.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.924
DARNELL:
Nah, we can't use that.Why?

10:20.968 --> 10:23.187
If the feds or Nia's people
have eyes on the accounts,

10:23.231 --> 10:26.147
it shouldn't trace back
to any of our devices.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.845
Hmm.

10:28.889 --> 10:29.977
What?

10:30.020 --> 10:33.067
Yeah, that's a good catch.
[chuckles]

10:34.590 --> 10:37.158
I'm so sorry, I don't--
But I did-- [clears throat]

10:37.201 --> 10:39.813
I'm sorry, I don't mean that
in, like, a...

10:39.856 --> 10:41.510
uh,
like a patronizing way.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.468
It's fine, man, whatever.I just mean it as a compliment.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.297
Come on, Pretzel.Uh...

10:46.341 --> 10:48.560
Uh, no, Murphy, you-you stay.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.737
Murphy stays, right?Why?

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
You heard Darnell-- the feds

10:52.739 --> 10:55.176
could be tracing Nia's account
activity and if they trace it

10:55.219 --> 10:56.786
to this specific library
and then they go

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
and ask the employees
about it,

10:58.353 --> 10:59.702
don't you think the employees
are gonna remember

10:59.746 --> 11:02.270
a-a blind woman?Whatever.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.359
FELIX:Yeah.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.842
Oh, um.. I'll just meet
you guys in the lobby, okay?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.670
I forgot I have to...

11:10.713 --> 11:12.584
p-pee. [laughs]

11:12.628 --> 11:14.848
All right, hurry.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.551
What are you doing?

11:22.594 --> 11:24.205
Shh.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.860
I have to put my money
in the safe.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.123
Oh, my God, and you waited
until they left?

11:29.166 --> 11:32.604
No, I just...
remembered just now.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.870
Fine, yes, I did wait, okay?

11:36.913 --> 11:40.308
But only because that Trey guy
literally stole money

11:40.351 --> 11:42.745
from us once before.
And, also, this thing

11:42.789 --> 11:44.312
about patronizing Darnell?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.227
I was not being patronizing
to Darnell.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.708
I was simply impressed
that he came up with something

11:48.751 --> 11:50.231
that I didn't.

11:50.274 --> 11:53.582
Which is the definition
of "patronizing."

11:53.625 --> 11:55.802
Okay, are you seriously
insinuating that I'm, like,

11:55.845 --> 11:56.933
racist or something?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.979
'Cause that's crazy.
I'm not racist.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.982
Everyone knows I'm not racist.
I'm the least racist person.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.331
[exhales]

12:03.374 --> 12:05.115
[buttons beeping]

12:05.159 --> 12:06.508
[mechanical whirring]

12:06.551 --> 12:08.902
[buttons beeping]

12:10.207 --> 12:12.470
What the hell are you doing?

12:12.514 --> 12:15.778
This is the last $2,000 I have
in the whole world, okay?

12:15.822 --> 12:19.042
I am making sure
the safe is secure.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.784
[beeping, whirring]It's a safe.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.264
Okay.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.614
Do you really think Darnell
thinks that I'm, like...?

12:25.657 --> 12:27.442
Ask him. I don't know.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.313
It doesn't matter, but you
shouldn't keep them waiting.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
[car doors closing]

12:32.839 --> 12:34.710
Hey, thank you for meeting us.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.538
I'm Gene Clemens,
this is Josh Wallace.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
Dennis Brandt.
Nice to meet you guys.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.541
Uh, how long's
this vehicle been here?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.021
Well, just got called
in this morning.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.849
The commuter said he'd seen it
for a couple days.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.503
Has there been any other
suspicious activity in town?

12:45.547 --> 12:47.114
[laughs]
No, pretty quiet, as usual.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.030
You guys still looking
for that, uh, blind girl?

12:50.073 --> 12:51.945
I was on patrol the
night the APB went out.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.251
Yeah...
uh, has she been spotted?

12:54.295 --> 12:55.992
No.
All right.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.994
Well, look,
I'll give you these photos.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.866
You can post them
in your station and, uh,

12:59.909 --> 13:01.215
keep an eye out.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.087
Uh, no, wait, wait, uh,
I-I've seen this girl.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.393
Excuse me?

13:05.436 --> 13:07.090
Oh, so you did see
a blind woman?

13:08.135 --> 13:10.920
Well, yeah, no,
but she wasn't bl--

13:10.964 --> 13:12.487
Oh, God.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.445
Where did you see them?

13:14.489 --> 13:16.752
Uh, Blue Ridge motel
off exit 22.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.059
When?That night, the night
the APB went out.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.538
You must be joking!

13:20.582 --> 13:22.540
Yeah, that-that-that's fair...
[stammers]

13:22.584 --> 13:23.759
GENE:
It never occurred to you

13:23.803 --> 13:25.413
that a blind woman
wanted for murder

13:25.456 --> 13:27.763
might be pretending
not to be blind?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.460
You're not making us
look good, man.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.593
Have a good day, guys.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.856
[car door shuts]

13:38.687 --> 13:41.603
[exhales]

13:41.646 --> 13:43.866
Okay.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.800
You said you know
the password, man.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.976
She has a few,
just...

14:07.020 --> 14:09.065
give me a sec.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.770
[groans]

14:23.863 --> 14:25.560
[exhales]
Told you.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.778
Oh![man clears throat]

14:26.822 --> 14:29.042
Sorry, sorry.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.267
[sighs]
She was broke.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.486
Oh, man.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.061
Look, I'm sorry.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.150
We'll find another way
to get the money.

14:50.193 --> 14:53.196
Maybe you forgot,
maybe you weren't listening,

14:53.240 --> 14:54.894
but my ass is on the line, too.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.942
Give me the keys.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.509
What? Where you going?

15:01.552 --> 15:03.250
Doesn't matter where I'm going.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.729
You're on your own.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.123
Come on, man.You're reckless, Darnell.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.691
That's why everyone around you
ends up dead.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.128
And I'm not gonna
be one of 'em.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
Give me the keys.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.873
â™ª

15:36.196 --> 15:39.677
Are you, uh, okay? Or...

15:39.721 --> 15:42.376
Yeah. Yeah.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.595
It's fine, let's just...
[sighs]

15:44.639 --> 15:46.771
...figure out
what to do next.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.604
Uh, okay,
I-I just, I do--

15:53.648 --> 15:55.955
I just want to clear
the air about earlier

15:55.998 --> 15:58.305
between us, um...
Earlier?

15:58.348 --> 16:01.134
The stupid thing I said
in the hotel.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.744
I was just trying
to pay you a compliment,

16:02.787 --> 16:04.746
and I know it came out like,
"blah, blah." [chuckles]

16:04.789 --> 16:06.835
Oh, yeah, no. It was fine.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.358
Are you sure? Okay.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.795
'Cause, like, if you do want
to talk about that to me,

16:10.839 --> 16:12.275
I can hear that.
It's fine.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.973
I-I just...
Let's just,
let's just focus on the...

16:14.016 --> 16:16.018
Okay.Yeah. Put our heads together
and think.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
Yeah, okay.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.418
JESS:
You drank all the vodka?

16:28.161 --> 16:30.250
Is this just gonna be
a thing now?

16:30.293 --> 16:32.469
Are you just gonna show up
whenever you feel like it?

16:32.513 --> 16:35.516
Okay, whatever.
I guess I'll just drink this.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.474
[sighs]

16:39.824 --> 16:41.000
Hi.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.220
Hey.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.831
This is fun.
It's like a hotel party.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.659
[chuckling]

16:48.703 --> 16:50.183
[chuckles]:Cheers.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.271
Cheers.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.059
[groans]

16:57.103 --> 16:58.887
[chuckles]
[scoffs]

16:58.930 --> 17:00.715
[sighs]

17:00.758 --> 17:02.804
I miss the Linsmore.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.893
Me, too.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.550
I miss everything.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.301
[sighs]

17:22.911 --> 17:26.436
Do you think
we will ever have,

17:26.480 --> 17:30.527
like, a somewhat normal life
ever again?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.272
Yeah.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.406
How?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.499
Just trust me.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.547
Right, but...

17:50.591 --> 17:53.333
that hasn't really
worked out for us.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.385
[door opens]

18:04.561 --> 18:05.606
[door slams shut]

18:05.649 --> 18:06.694
Hello?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.043
I just came to grab my stuff.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.001
Did we get the money?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
No. Nia's broke.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.875
[sighs]

18:13.918 --> 18:15.964
Where are Darnell and Felix?

18:16.007 --> 18:17.922
I left them there.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.663
You left them
at the library?
Yes.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.926
Why? What are we doing?
What's next?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.754
I got nothing.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.627
And they're not gonna be able
to come up with the money, so...

18:28.368 --> 18:30.500
I'm out of here.Where are you going?

18:30.544 --> 18:33.721
Anywhere but Chicago.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.462
What?

18:35.505 --> 18:37.725
Hang on, no.
Don't do that.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.292
Don't do that.Come on.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
We can...

18:41.772 --> 18:43.513
we can figure out
how to get the money.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.776
No.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.474
We can't.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.695
This is an impossible task,

18:51.739 --> 18:54.350
and Josiah knew it.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.352
And he's punishing
all of us.

18:56.396 --> 18:59.050
Then let's prove him wrong.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.750
[scoffs softly]Trey, you don't want
to be on the run.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.273
What are you gonna do?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.362
You're gonna never see
your friends and family again?

19:06.406 --> 19:10.540
I'm three days in, and I
can tell you that it sucks.

19:11.367 --> 19:16.111
If we figure out how to get
the money, you can go home.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.338
And how do you plan
on doing that?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.823
Felix put two grand
in the safe.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.956
There's a casino downstairs.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.175
We can gamble.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.785
Oh, my God.
It's worth a shot.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.743
No, that's stupid.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.092
It won't work.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.486
Neither will running away
from Josiah.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.836
Okay.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.490
What's the code?

19:47.534 --> 19:50.014
I don't know,
but I can figure it out.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.494
I remember the tune.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.104
He put it in,
like, ten times.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.715
Tune?
Yeah.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.325
[hums a tune]

19:56.369 --> 19:58.153
That was the tune.Okay.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.155
Right here.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.507
Okay.

20:04.551 --> 20:05.682
[keys beep]

20:05.726 --> 20:07.075
[hums] That's two.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.903
[hums two notes]

20:08.946 --> 20:09.904
[keys beep]

20:09.947 --> 20:11.906
Two, three. [hums]

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
[keys beep]

20:16.911 --> 20:18.434
[safe unlocks and buzzes]

20:18.478 --> 20:19.914
Okay, that was good.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.046
All good.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.617
â™ª I try to be patient

20:27.661 --> 20:29.140
â™ª Let it be

20:29.184 --> 20:31.882
â™ª Let it happen

20:31.926 --> 20:33.928
â™ª Naturally

20:33.971 --> 20:36.583
â™ª Got me begging

20:36.626 --> 20:38.846
â™ª On my knees

20:38.889 --> 20:40.195
â™ª Oh, no

20:40.239 --> 20:41.457
Yeah, let's go.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.937
â™ª Oh, no

20:42.980 --> 20:45.287
â™ª My excitement Follow.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.420
â™ª Gets the better of me

20:47.463 --> 20:48.986
MURPHY:
Swear you're good?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.640
TREY:One time in
the third grade,

20:50.684 --> 20:51.728
I was playing blackjack
against my teacher...Third grade?

20:51.772 --> 20:54.209
I won, so...Chair.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.603
Hey.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.474
How you doing?
You good?

20:58.518 --> 21:01.695
Hi.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.566
â™ª One thing

21:03.610 --> 21:05.568
â™ª On my brain

21:05.612 --> 21:08.963
â™ª Gotta work â™ª Work, work, work, workâ™ª

21:09.006 --> 21:11.270
â™ª To get by...

21:11.313 --> 21:13.837
We just won 200 bucks.

21:13.881 --> 21:14.969
Good.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.319
Just another
$299,800 to go.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.407
Don't jinx it.

21:18.451 --> 21:21.454
â™ª Work no more

21:21.497 --> 21:24.065
â™ª No more

21:25.762 --> 21:27.416

21:27.460 --> 21:29.853
[cheering]
Okay.
[clears throat]

21:29.897 --> 21:31.333
How you feeling?
You feeling good?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.161
I... Sure.
You feeling lucky?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.815
A little luck?
Huh? Okay.Yeah. No. Yeah.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.860
I think we should go all in.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.514
What?

21:38.558 --> 21:39.820
Seriously?

21:39.863 --> 21:41.300
Yeah.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.040
I mean, we're not gonna
get to 300 grand

21:43.084 --> 21:44.390
by betting
a couple hundred bucks.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.479
Plus, we're on a
roll right now.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.743
You know what I mean?
You got to feel that...

21:49.786 --> 21:51.658
that wave, you know?

21:51.701 --> 21:53.616
[exhales]

21:53.660 --> 21:55.531
[sputters]

21:56.793 --> 21:59.013
â™ª

22:05.106 --> 22:06.499
[people groan]

22:08.631 --> 22:08.979
What happened?

22:12.983 --> 22:15.334
GENE:
Do you recognize this woman?Uh, yes.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.423
She... she stayed here
with her boyfriend.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.642
Uh... Why?Oh. She was here with him?

22:19.686 --> 22:21.122
HANNAH:
No. Who's that?

22:21.165 --> 22:23.864
Uh, her dude had,
like, longish hair.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.039
This tall.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.388
Him?

22:26.432 --> 22:27.911
HANNAH:
Yeah, him.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.610
Uh-- did you, did you get
their names, by chance?

22:30.653 --> 22:33.264
Not hers, but his was, uh,
Gordon Howard.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.005
And were they
with anyone else?

22:35.049 --> 22:37.268
No, I... they booked two rooms,
but I didn't see their friends.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.270
Any form of ID?
Passport? Anything?

22:39.314 --> 22:40.489
No, they paid in cash.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.056
Did they say where
they were going?

22:42.099 --> 22:43.274
No. Like, that dude's name

22:43.318 --> 22:44.493
is seriously all
I know about them.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.147
Are they, like,
criminals or something?

22:46.190 --> 22:46.930
Yes.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.541
Wow.
But thank you.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.543
We appreciate you.
You were very helpful.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.544
Anytime.Mm-hmm.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.023
Of course they paid
in cash.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.242
All right, look, we need
to call Canadian authorities,

22:54.285 --> 22:55.635
have them put a APB out
on Gordon Howard.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.724
Hopefully,
he's still using that name.

23:02.903 --> 23:08.082
Okay, what if we fake
a GoFundMe account,

23:08.125 --> 23:10.954
but for, like, a dying kid?

23:11.825 --> 23:13.609
[whispers]:
A dying kid?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.090
I don't know, man.
I'm sorry, okay?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.308
[sighs]

23:17.352 --> 23:20.137
There's got to be
another way.
There isn't.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.967
Look, we tried.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.579
I'm gonna go.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.755
Don't go. Don't do that.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.670
I told you,
you don't want to be on the run.

23:31.497 --> 23:35.109
That's why I think I'm gonna go
back and tell Josiah everything.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.241
Hopefully, he understands
that it wasn't my fault.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.722
Yeah, that'll work.
He's so, uh, reasonable.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.681
Nice guy. Yeah, good idea.

23:41.724 --> 23:42.986
It's worth a shot.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.466
And then what,
you're just gonna let

23:44.510 --> 23:46.163
Darnell take the hit?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.385
I have to.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.561
[sighs]

23:52.605 --> 23:54.084
God, we have a...

23:54.128 --> 23:56.957
totally different
view on...

23:57.000 --> 23:58.741
how friendship works.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.264
Okay, yeah, that's cute.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.266
But I don't need your advice.
I gotta do me.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.443
Why are guys so annoying?
You're...

24:04.486 --> 24:07.620
you're clearly trying
to be a dick.

24:07.663 --> 24:08.882
You want to be a dick.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.840
You're just gonna
leave Darnell here

24:10.884 --> 24:12.799
and hope
that your psychotic boss

24:12.842 --> 24:15.018
doesn't find him and kill him?

24:17.281 --> 24:18.805
Yeah, do you, Trey.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.459
Do you.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.026
But I'm not giving up.

24:24.941 --> 24:28.597
And I don't care
if I have to rob this casino.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.991
I'm gonna get that money.

24:32.601 --> 24:35.430
I'm gonna get that money.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.912
Another 20, gentlemen.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.177
Are you serious about that?

24:43.960 --> 24:45.658
About what?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.573
Actually stealing it?

24:47.616 --> 24:49.139
Yeah, I am. Why?

24:49.183 --> 24:51.968
'Cause there's this guy...

24:52.012 --> 24:54.580
and he's got about a
million chips on his table.

24:54.623 --> 24:57.191
Definitely more than 300k.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.412
Seriously?

25:01.456 --> 25:03.893
Is he alone?Mm-hmm.

25:06.722 --> 25:09.203
Okay.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.030
Um...

25:10.073 --> 25:12.554
okay, I could, uh...

25:12.598 --> 25:14.034
I could, um...

25:14.077 --> 25:16.123
I could pretend
I want to go home with him,

25:16.166 --> 25:20.083
and I can,
and then I could, um...

25:20.127 --> 25:23.304
You don't need to do all that.

25:23.347 --> 25:26.525
But if you can get him
to cash out and meet me

25:26.568 --> 25:29.702
in the parking lot,
I'll hold him up.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.921
Really?Mm-hmm.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.360
Where is he?

25:37.231 --> 25:40.408
At the table we were at earlier.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.501
Meet you
in the parking lot.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.372
Come on, Pretzel.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.688
Ha-ha! Don't take it personally,
my friend.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.603
Sometimes you just...

26:01.647 --> 26:04.084
Oh, sorry, my dog is...

26:04.127 --> 26:06.129
drunk.[laughs]

26:06.173 --> 26:08.567
Does your dog have a name?

26:08.610 --> 26:11.526
Uh, Pretzel.That's cute.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.354
Do you have a name?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.008
Sean.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.010
[pats chair]

26:21.971 --> 26:24.583
Let's see what kind of luck
you bring me tonight.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.197
[cheering][whoops]

26:30.240 --> 26:31.285
[Sean laughing]

26:31.328 --> 26:32.721
Let me get you another drink.

26:32.765 --> 26:33.853
Maybe you should
cash in those chips,

26:33.896 --> 26:34.810
and we can get out of here.

26:34.854 --> 26:35.942
Aw, come on,
couple more hands.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.423
â™ª I could get used to this

26:39.467 --> 26:41.687
â™ª Whoo, ooh, ooh

26:43.384 --> 26:44.820
â™ª Whoo, ooh, ooh

26:44.864 --> 26:47.736
[laughs]
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

26:47.780 --> 26:50.609
we're gonna be, uh, taking
this to the cashier.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.262
â™ª In with the new

26:53.089 --> 26:56.266
â™ª Forget everything
that you thought you knew... â™ª

26:58.486 --> 27:02.925
WOMAN:
That's $423,745,
Mr. Bryce.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.187
Congratulations.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.015
Thanks. Keep $200
for yourself.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.583
[clears throat]Would you like your
winnings sent to your room?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.803
That would be terrific.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.067
You-you have a room here?

27:14.110 --> 27:18.027
Yeah. I don't like
to drink and drive.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.943
I'm a model citizen.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.904
Shall we?

27:24.947 --> 27:26.383
Yeah.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.559
Yeah.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.303
It's nothing glamorous, but...

27:33.347 --> 27:35.349
come on in.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.398
Uh, right, so...

27:41.442 --> 27:42.617
[knocking]

27:42.661 --> 27:44.271
Mr. Bryce?Yeah. Come on in.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.447
Your winnings, sir.Yeah. Oops. Sorry.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.622
Right this way.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.319
You can, uh,
put it in the safe.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.756
Okay.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.553
SEAN:
All right,
I'll lock it up, my friend.

28:05.596 --> 28:09.035
Okay, and, uh,
this is for you.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.341
Go get yourself
a drink, okay?
Thank you.

28:11.385 --> 28:14.083
Have a great night.You, too, sir.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.742
[keys beeping]

28:20.786 --> 28:24.485
[safe whirrs, clicks]Okay...

28:24.528 --> 28:26.269
Sorry about that.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.358
Come here.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.798
You good?Yeah. Sorry.

28:32.841 --> 28:35.452
No, you just got really serious
there all of a sudden.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.976
Um...

28:37.019 --> 28:40.066
No, yeah, I'm good.
Really good. Yeah.
Okay.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.981
Uh, actually, I'm
just gonna need...

28:42.024 --> 28:44.679
I think I should take
out my dog real fast,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.507
um, to pee, just
'cause he...

28:46.550 --> 28:49.031
he'll be annoying
during...

28:49.075 --> 28:50.554
[sighs]:
All right.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.773
Sounds good.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.296
Hurry back.Okay.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.515
Okay.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.430
Um, what's the room number?

28:56.473 --> 28:58.824
[sighs]:
901.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.695
Okay.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.219
Can I actually get
a room key, just...?

29:04.090 --> 29:07.702
Yeah, it's on the table
by the, uh, lamp.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.760
Got it.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.415
[door opens]

29:38.080 --> 29:41.475
What the hell happened?He has a room here.

29:41.518 --> 29:44.957
It's room 901, and he put
all the money in the safe.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.480
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what the
code is, but I know

29:46.523 --> 29:48.699
it's all the same number,
so just try all of them, okay?

29:48.743 --> 29:50.136
I'll get him
in the shower.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.268
You come in the room,
steal it.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.009
Okay. Okay.Okay, here's
the room key.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.969
Try all the numbers, okay?
Take me back. Let's go.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.535
Mm-hmm.Hurry.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.190
Pretzel.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.539
Forward.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.367
â™ª I could feel

30:04.411 --> 30:06.630
[clears throat]

30:08.415 --> 30:11.026
Hi.Thought you took the key.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.507
Um, yeah, I lost it.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.814
Uh, I think I
dropped it. Sorry.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.512
â™ª I've come so far so fast

30:18.555 --> 30:21.471
â™ª And it feels like
a hundred years â™ª

30:21.515 --> 30:25.432
[muffled voices inside room]

30:25.475 --> 30:26.825
Just 'cause I,
I smell like...

30:26.868 --> 30:28.565
I feel like I smell
like casino.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.437
I kind of want
to take a shower.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.396
You want to join me?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.659
I sure do.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.837
[door closes inside room]

30:39.838 --> 30:41.013
[shower running]

30:41.056 --> 30:44.059
â™ª I know you think
you could do too â™ª

30:44.103 --> 30:48.150
â™ª I know you think
you feel it's true â™ª

30:48.194 --> 30:51.980
â™ª It's the little things

30:52.024 --> 30:54.374
â™ª In life

30:54.417 --> 30:56.942
â™ª That I feel

30:56.985 --> 30:59.031
â™ª

31:01.120 --> 31:03.426
â™ª 'Cause I can feel it

31:03.470 --> 31:05.080
â™ª Feel it

31:05.124 --> 31:06.908
[beeping]

31:06.952 --> 31:10.651
â™ª 'Cause I can feel it,
feel it â™ª

31:10.694 --> 31:14.873
â™ª It's the little things

31:14.916 --> 31:17.005
â™ª In life

31:17.049 --> 31:19.660
â™ª That I feel.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.063
Are you good?

31:31.106 --> 31:34.849
Um... I just forgot
I'm on my period.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.198
[laughs]

31:36.242 --> 31:37.896
I don't care.
We're in the shower.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.201
Okay?

31:39.245 --> 31:40.899
[laughs][laughs softly]

31:40.942 --> 31:42.204
Okay.

31:42.248 --> 31:43.858
[beeping]

31:43.902 --> 31:45.729
[beeps, clicks]

31:52.040 --> 31:53.955
Sorry. I'm kind
of weird about it.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.261
But...

31:55.304 --> 31:56.958
All right.One sec. Sorry.

31:57.002 --> 32:00.309
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I get it. I get it.Um...

32:00.353 --> 32:02.398
Yeah, okay.Wait.

32:02.442 --> 32:06.663
Wait. No, seriously, wait.
Get back in. Come on.

32:06.707 --> 32:09.449
If I'd have known
I wasn't gonna have sex tonight,

32:09.492 --> 32:12.147
I would've just
gone home to my wife.

32:12.191 --> 32:13.583
MURPHY:
No, I want to. I...

32:13.627 --> 32:15.455
SEAN:
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.979
It's okay.
No hard feelings, okay?

32:18.023 --> 32:19.807
Just, uh, get changed.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.678
But, um...

32:21.722 --> 32:24.420
No, hang on.
Hang on. Just...

32:26.031 --> 32:27.510
[sighs]Wait. Where are you going?

32:27.554 --> 32:29.077
Back to the casino.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.775
You should, uh, get your clothes
on. I'm gonna do the same.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.342
Why? You already
made so much money.

32:33.386 --> 32:36.432
Let's-let's just
get back in shower. Come on.

32:36.476 --> 32:37.738
Yeah.Sorry. I'm good.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.479
Yeah, okay. Babe,
do me a favor.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.741
Get out of my way.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.525
Wait. Wait, wait.Just...

32:42.569 --> 32:45.920
I said, get your clothes on.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.706
[beeping, clicks]

32:51.143 --> 32:53.232
Where the hell's my money?

32:53.275 --> 32:54.711
It's not there?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.323
Where'd it go?Where the hell's my money?!

32:57.366 --> 32:59.760
I don't know.
Calm down.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.022
I don't know, and I...I said,

33:01.066 --> 33:03.242
where the hell is my money?![groans]

33:03.285 --> 33:04.591

33:58.688 --> 33:59.385
Okay.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.299
We're good. We're good.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.692
We're good. Go.[car beeps]

34:02.736 --> 34:04.564
Give me the leash.

34:04.607 --> 34:08.350
Get the cash.
Cash, cash, cash.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.873
Get in.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.050
Oh, what's your name, bro?

34:12.093 --> 34:14.095
Good boy. Good boy.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.532
Get back here!
Hey, you!

34:16.576 --> 34:18.578

34:41.731 --> 34:43.081
We're good.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.735
[gasps]
What?

34:45.779 --> 34:47.085
[gasps]

34:47.128 --> 34:50.262
Oh, my God, that was insane.

34:52.873 --> 34:56.137
Thank you for helping me, um...

34:56.181 --> 34:57.660
Yeah. It's nothing.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.532
Yeah. [laughs]

34:59.575 --> 35:01.969
I got you.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.887
I'm gonna call Darnell and
find out where they are.Yeah, call him.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.367
[laughs]

35:08.410 --> 35:10.543
How did I get here, man?[phone buzzing]

35:10.586 --> 35:13.328
I just wanted to start
a guide dog school,

35:13.372 --> 35:17.550
do a little good in the
world, and-and then...

35:17.593 --> 35:18.942
And then...

35:18.986 --> 35:21.597
And then
you trafficked heroin.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.904
Not by choice.
I'm not like...

35:23.947 --> 35:25.514
Like me? 'Cause, you know,

35:25.558 --> 35:27.212
I didn't really
have a choice, either.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.257
No. Oh, my God, no.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.650
That's not what
I was about to say.

35:30.693 --> 35:31.390
What were you gonna say?

35:31.433 --> 35:32.434
I was about to say...

35:32.478 --> 35:34.132
WOMAN:
Hi. Excuse me, sir?

35:34.175 --> 35:36.743
Yeah?I was actually
talking to him.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.267
Your time limit
for the computer is up.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.835
[laughing]:
Well, there's a time limit?

35:41.878 --> 35:43.489
There is.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.534
Fine. Whatever.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.321
No, no, no, I'm...
Um, ma'am, I'm sorry.

35:49.364 --> 35:52.062
Excuse me. Uh, this woman

35:52.106 --> 35:55.414
has been here at her computer
long before my friend came,

35:55.457 --> 35:57.764
so, are you kicking her off,
too, or...?

35:57.807 --> 36:02.595
Sir, I don't know when she
arrived, but I know when he did.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.987
Oh, interesting.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.946
Do you know when I arrived?
Because I came with him,

36:05.989 --> 36:07.817
and you're not kicking me
off the computer, are you?

36:07.861 --> 36:09.254
You're welcome
to leave, too.It's fine.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.777
Let's go.No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.953
No, no. No, no, no.
Hang on. I'm sorry.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.956
Uh, time out, everybody.
Hang on.

36:15.999 --> 36:19.786
Is anyone else a little...
little disturbed by this

36:19.829 --> 36:21.657
blatant display
of discrimination

36:21.701 --> 36:23.181
that is happening
right before your eyes?

36:23.224 --> 36:25.313
Because, frankly,
I find it very disturbing.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.967
Sir, one more outburst,

36:27.010 --> 36:29.230
and I will have
security escort you out.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.929
Oh, I get a warning.
I wonder why!

36:32.973 --> 36:35.149
I'm just doing my job,
and he's over the time limit.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.586
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Let me handle this.Stop. Stop.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.458
Time limit?
We did not get a time limit

36:39.501 --> 36:40.807
when we came in here, okay?

36:40.850 --> 36:42.374
Did you get a time limit?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.463
Hey. Excuse me?Yeah?

36:44.506 --> 36:46.639
I don't know who got a time
limit. Did you get a time limit?

36:46.682 --> 36:49.555
How about you, sir?
Did you receive a time limit?

36:49.598 --> 36:51.644
Didn't think so. Oh.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.776
Look. A list
of library rules.

36:53.820 --> 36:54.951
Perhaps we should review them.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.040
What do you think?
Let's see

36:57.084 --> 37:00.479
if there's anything
about a time limit.

37:00.522 --> 37:04.570
Rule number one--
"Use a whisper voice." Oopsie.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.049
Rule number two--

37:06.093 --> 37:08.617
"Treat books with respect."
Books.WOMAN: Security?

37:08.661 --> 37:10.445
Not human beings,
but books.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.969
Interesting. Oh.That's it.
We're calling the cops.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.755
No, no. I'm so sorry.
We're trying to...

37:17.539 --> 37:18.671
[sighs]

37:24.111 --> 37:26.374
Can you do
me a favor,

37:26.418 --> 37:28.376
and just do exactly
what this cop says?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.465
Yeah, of course.

37:30.509 --> 37:33.251
I'm so sorry about this.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.035
I am gonna
get us out of this.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.081
Don't do anything. Just,

37:38.125 --> 37:39.953
like I said,

37:39.996 --> 37:42.477
do what the cop says, please.

37:44.305 --> 37:47.177
I just got off the phone
with a couple of detectives.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.702
Gordon Howard?

37:49.745 --> 37:51.921
Yes?

37:51.965 --> 37:53.358
Are you aware
that you're wanted

37:53.401 --> 37:55.229
by the Chicago
Police Department?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.927
Uh... I don't think so.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.886
That... No, I don't...

37:59.929 --> 38:02.192
Um, no, that-that's...

38:02.236 --> 38:04.543
That must be
a misundersta-standing.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.588
Hmm.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.111
Oh, my God.What?

38:08.155 --> 38:09.417
Stay here.

38:09.461 --> 38:10.940
What's going on?The cops got them.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.943
Why?I don't know.

38:13.987 --> 38:14.988
Stay here.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.816
Uh, why him?

You seriously
offering me a bribe right now?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.666
How's 50K?

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
How about a hundred?

38:45.148 --> 38:49.588
Huh? 'Cause I mean, I've got it
with me right now. Cash.

Why? What are you doing?

39:08.520 --> 39:11.174

out of this mess.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.698
Please.

Don't worry. We'll
have enough for Jess.

Told you.

so, I mean...

Let me see the bag.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.589
What?

39:38.114 --> 39:39.725
This is way
more than that.

Yeah, just take
the hundred and let them go.

Where you going?

take all of it.[police car door closes]

No, it was a false alarm.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.348
Just someone else with that name
that matched his description.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.307
Oh! I'm such an idiot!

40:40.350 --> 40:44.529
I knew. I knew. I knew I wasn't
gonna get them that easily.

All right, look, Josh,
relax, man.

You guys should do the same.

Good night.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.857
Let's call it, man.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.652
You guys, I think we should
just do what I suggested.

We've been sitting
here for two hours.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.874
We can't waste
any more time.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.007
Give me the phone.

we're calling from is blocked.
