WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:04.900
It got ugly.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.800
Didn't think I was going
to get out of there.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.300
No, he still hasn't checked in.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
I'll let you know as soon as I know.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.200
Tell me you have it.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.300
How much time have you had?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.200
Dude, it's a keg!

00:20.300 --> 00:22.500
You go to the liquor store, pick it up.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.700
Here's the thing about
surprise parties, okay?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.700
They're supposed tobe a surp...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.300
Dude, what was that?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.800
Chris, man, talk to me.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.400
What's up, dude, are you there?

00:51.100 --> 00:53.000
- Are you okay?
- I got into an accident.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.500
- Accident?
- I'll call you back.

00:54.535 --> 00:55.900
Don't worry. I'm fine.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.205
It was a simple question, McGee.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.340
Yeah, one I would expect
from Tony, not you.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.940
I'm just being curious.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.440
About when I lost my virginity?

01:57.475 --> 01:58.505
No, you misunderstood.

01:58.540 --> 02:01.140
I'm not asking when you
lost your virginity but if...

02:01.440 --> 02:02.640
you lost it.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.139
What's wrong with this picture?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.940
You mean, aside from
Tony being here before us?

02:11.039 --> 02:12.490
And actually working?

02:12.525 --> 02:13.940
I can hear you, you know?

02:22.840 --> 02:24.740
I am here if you would like to talk.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.140
About what?

02:26.540 --> 02:28.440
I know how much you cared about her.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.340
I'm fine, Ziva.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.740
All right, but I thought maybe
you need a little cheering up?

02:33.840 --> 02:37.540
If needed to be cheered up, I would've
put superglue on McGee's keyboard.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.840
You put superglue on my keyboard.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.605
- You got me.
- Come on.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.640
I was sort of saving it for a rainy day.

02:46.740 --> 02:47.705
Did it help?

02:47.740 --> 02:49.340
- Didn't hurt.
- You know...

02:55.140 --> 02:56.740
- Boss, Tony...
- I know.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.840
Are you ever going to learn, McGee?

03:05.040 --> 03:07.940
Grab your gear, we got a
petty officer in a hit-and-run.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.040
Guys...

03:14.840 --> 03:16.540
Little help, please.

03:20.940 --> 03:21.905
Hit-and-run.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.740
It's a felony now, but in DiNozzo's
Guide to Women, a way of life.

03:24.940 --> 03:26.140
In this case, death.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.540
How did he end up over here?

03:29.575 --> 03:30.840
Good question, DiNozzo.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.740
At least he went out looking sharp.

03:32.775 --> 03:34.205
But when he dressed this morning,

03:34.240 --> 03:37.340
I doubt he was aware
that the end was nigh.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.040
When people choose not
to wear their seat belts,

03:40.140 --> 03:42.640
they rarely consider
their own mortality.

03:42.740 --> 03:46.540
If they did, they would
definitely wear their seat belts.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.640
You know, I would've
thought with that kind of

03:48.740 --> 03:51.040
damage he would be
all the way down there.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.940
Did you move my body, Jethro?

03:53.040 --> 03:54.040
Someone did.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.340
Well, the state police said they didn't
touch the body after they ID'd him.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.040
Report indicated he blew
that stop sign over there.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.005
Swerved to avoid another car.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.840
Then he went through the
windshield when he hit the bridge?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.140
Hello.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.640
This just keeps getting better.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.140
I'm going with stripper.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.240
This is not an uncommon way
for young servicemen to...

04:16.440 --> 04:18.339
complement their incomes.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.240
In fact, when I was young, I used to...

04:24.740 --> 04:25.940
Used to what?

04:26.240 --> 04:27.440
Oh, my...

04:27.640 --> 04:29.040
Shotgun, close range.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.540
Our hit-and-run just
became shoot-and-scoot.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.040
But there's no visible
damage to the head.

04:36.140 --> 04:38.840
I do not believe that this gentleman...

04:39.840 --> 04:41.440
made that hole.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.840
And if he didn't make it, who did?

04:44.740 --> 04:48.340
The more I think about it, the
more I can't believe we fell for it.

04:48.540 --> 04:49.840
Tony with a girlfriend?

04:49.940 --> 04:52.440
I believe he had real
feelings for her, McGee.

04:53.140 --> 04:55.640
I don't doubt that...
see what she looks like?

04:56.340 --> 04:58.105
Sounds like you wish
you had the assignment.

04:58.140 --> 05:01.040
Yeah, I don't know why the director
didn't give it to me to begin with.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.740
Still talking about the little
probie losing his virginity?

05:04.775 --> 05:06.040
Down here!

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
There.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.140
This is more like it.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.805
She has a smashed cranium,

05:16.840 --> 05:19.840
lacerations and possible
multiple fractures.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.840
I think we've found
our human cannonball.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.640
I think the state police
definitely had it wrong, boss.

05:25.740 --> 05:28.140
Petty Officer Munoz didn't
blow off that stop sign.

05:28.175 --> 05:29.405
Nah, he was in the other car.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
He got run off the
road by the guy who did.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.240
Then got shot for his trouble.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.540
No footprints.

05:35.140 --> 05:38.840
Her companion took off in Munoz's
vehicle and left her here to die.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.040
Who does that?

05:40.540 --> 05:42.840
Clearly, someone in a terrible rush.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.440
Rush to where?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.840
Well, we know where Petty
Officer Munoz was in a rush to.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.840
We spoke to his roommate.
Munoz was throwing a surprise

05:50.940 --> 05:53.540
party for one of his friends
who just arrived from Iraq.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.840
But he was late coming back from...

05:56.640 --> 06:00.340
the Chelsea Girls School
Class of '5750 year reunion.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.240
And I got the pictures to prove it.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.240
My God.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.740
It's like Cocoon meets Dirty Dancing.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.040
I wonder if Ducky has dreams like this.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.440
Gibbs probably isn't too far behind.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.140
He's standing right behind
me, sorry about that, boss?

06:23.240 --> 06:26.740
Going to be your dreams
one day, too, DiNozzo.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.340
Well, maybe Petty Officer Munoz
danced with the wrong woman.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.940
And was run off the road
by a jealous husband.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.640
What, in his motorized wheelchair?

06:36.340 --> 06:37.905
Come on, guys, this is pretty simple.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.240
We're looking for a bad guy who got into
an accident, and then he carjacked Munoz

06:41.340 --> 06:43.140
cause he wanted to get
the hell out of Dodge.

06:43.175 --> 06:44.840
Put out a BOLO on Munoz's truck.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.440
We got a few more leads
to follow, but... my gut

06:47.540 --> 06:51.240
tells me that Munoz had a terminal
case of wrong place, wrong time.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.140
Unless your gut...

06:54.240 --> 06:55.640
told you something else, boss.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.240
- The girl.
- Yeah, we got a hit on the prints.

06:58.840 --> 07:02.940
Heidi Campisano, 25. Though
this picture's three years old.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.840
Pyramid schemes, Internet
fraud, bogus rare coins.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.340
She is a con artist.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.505
Was.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.305
Dropped off the radar three years ago.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.140
I'm guessing since she's laying in
our morgue it wasn't to go legit.

07:13.175 --> 07:14.175
The car hers?

07:14.240 --> 07:16.840
No. Car is registered
to Nicholas Barnes.

07:18.740 --> 07:19.840
DiNozzo!

07:20.240 --> 07:21.240
Here.

07:26.740 --> 07:27.740
Nicky!

07:28.740 --> 07:30.140
Get your ass out here!

07:31.940 --> 07:35.240
Run in the bathroom like a little
girl when he saw you guys pull up.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.040
This is about Tiffany, right?

07:38.740 --> 07:39.740
Tiffany?

07:39.940 --> 07:40.940
Yeah, his girl.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.240
Nicky!

07:43.040 --> 07:44.340
The name's not Tiffany.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.640
Oh, really.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.340
You don't say.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.840
I told him that girl was no good.

07:50.940 --> 07:52.240
He didn't listen to me.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.940
Well, there's some Navy cops here
want to ask you a few questions.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.640
Now, you remember what I
told you about telling lies.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.340
Something wrong?

08:09.540 --> 08:10.340
Nope.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.940
Just had to pee all of a sudden?

08:12.240 --> 08:16.140
Figured you want to ask me about Tiff,
didn't really want to talk about her.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
Is that a crime?

08:17.340 --> 08:18.140
No.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.240
But murder is.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.840
Oh, murder! Perfect!

08:21.940 --> 08:23.040
You know this guy?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
Nope.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.640
He was shot and killed today.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.740
Your car was found at the
scene wrapped around a bridge.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.440
Not my car.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.405
I gave it to Tiff.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.840
She said hers was stolen.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.940
Oh, tell 'em what else you gave her.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.240
A thousand bucks.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.440
Tell 'em why.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.005
Oh, for an operation.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.840
What kind? He didn't even ask.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.940
You also didn't ask how she was.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.340
Car wrapped around a tree and all.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.840
I hope she's dead.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.340
She is.

09:02.340 --> 09:05.540
If you'd like us to arrest you
now, Nicky, that can be arranged.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.190
Hey, now, wait a second.

09:07.225 --> 09:08.740
Just hold on right there.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.140
My boy ain't guilty of anything
except for being an idiot.

09:12.340 --> 09:13.705
Now, that girl Tiffany,

09:13.740 --> 09:16.640
or whoever she was, she was playing
him and a couple of other guys.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.940
He spoke up to her about it, and she
run off, that was about a week ago.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.740
She said she loved me.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.640
You don't lie to somebody you love.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.005
Do you know how
wonderful it is to be with

09:29.040 --> 09:31.740
someone who doesn't even
lie about the little things?

09:31.775 --> 09:34.440
How can I ever trust
you again? Why? Why? Why?

09:34.475 --> 09:35.475
DiNozzo.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.540
Sorry, boss.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.340
I ain't seen her since she left.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.540
Anybody seen you this morning?

09:44.340 --> 09:46.340
Oh, he was here with me, all day.

09:46.540 --> 09:49.240
I got about a half a dozen
customers who can vouch for that.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.240
- Names.
- Sure.

09:51.540 --> 09:55.540
Like I said, my boy's an
idiot, but he ain't a killer.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.640
Now, a girl like that,
playing with people's hearts,

09:58.840 --> 10:01.040
you track down some
of them jilted lovers.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.440
I guarantee you'll find
out who done her in.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.340
I can't wait to make those calls.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.440
The demise of someone as young as

10:08.475 --> 10:10.040
you is always a tragedy,

10:10.140 --> 10:12.840
but someone in your chosen...

10:12.940 --> 10:14.805
profession, it's to be expected.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.140
Yeah, for example, did
you know that the...

10:17.240 --> 10:19.340
infamous confidence man,

10:19.375 --> 10:20.805
Victor Lustig,

10:20.840 --> 10:24.440
sold the Eiffel Tower, almost twice,

10:24.740 --> 10:27.140
but then he convinced Al Capone

10:27.340 --> 10:30.440
to buy $50,000 of bogus shares.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.340
What do we have here?

10:49.140 --> 10:50.240
You're late.

10:50.940 --> 10:53.940
- We have an appointment, Duck?
- No, we have a crisis.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.540
I apologize for not seeing it sooner.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.340
You know how I feel about apologies.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.840
Yes, well, you may want to
make an exception in this case.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.640
I now know

11:05.040 --> 11:09.140
why the driver of the Chevy didn't
bother to check on his companion.

11:09.340 --> 11:10.540
She was dead...

11:11.340 --> 11:12.640
before she was put in the car.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.740
All her vehicular
injuries are postmortem.

11:16.140 --> 11:16.940
How?

11:17.040 --> 11:18.740
Extensive blunt force trauma.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.940
She had a subdermal hematoma that would
almost certainly have proved fatal.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.340
Poor girl was beaten to death.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
Thanks, Duck.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.940
Well, I knew all that an hour ago.

11:33.540 --> 11:35.540
What I just learned was

11:35.640 --> 11:37.840
that she had been pregnant.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.340
She gave birth?

11:39.640 --> 11:40.640
Yeah.

11:41.740 --> 11:43.640
Right before she was murdered.

11:52.673 --> 11:55.873
Hey, Abs, hope you don't mind, but
I need to use one of your computers.

11:55.973 --> 11:59.573
Hard to concentrate while Tony's
calling Heidi's former victims.

11:59.873 --> 12:02.273
He's become very sensitive
to the word "liar" these days.

12:05.973 --> 12:07.073
Thought you quit.

12:08.173 --> 12:11.773
McGee, there is a baby missing
that might need medical attention.

12:11.873 --> 12:13.373
I need to be at the top of my game.

12:13.473 --> 12:15.473
Going to spend most of
your game in the bathroom.

12:15.508 --> 12:16.638
I already thought of that.

12:16.673 --> 12:20.073
I'm upping my salt intake to
increase my body's water retentions.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.273
Of course you are.

12:26.573 --> 12:28.073
So what do you have for Gibbs?

12:28.673 --> 12:29.773
Nothing.

12:30.673 --> 12:32.073
Why, is he on his way down here?

12:32.108 --> 12:33.273
No, he's here.

12:34.373 --> 12:36.773
And he's talking about
himself in the third person.

12:36.873 --> 12:37.838
I like it.

12:37.873 --> 12:39.338
Ducky said you had something.

12:39.373 --> 12:41.673
Don't you want to see
what McGee has first?

12:42.273 --> 12:43.573
I came down to see you.

12:45.573 --> 12:49.173
Abby was able to recover amniotic
fluid from the dead woman's clothing.

12:49.273 --> 12:50.573
You got the baby's DNA?

12:50.773 --> 12:52.173
Abby's running it now.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.473
You can't use it to find the
father, but when you have a suspect,

12:56.673 --> 12:59.073
Abby can test it and
see if he is the father.

12:59.108 --> 13:00.108
Nicholas Barnes.

13:00.273 --> 13:01.673
Abby already ruled him out.

13:01.773 --> 13:02.973
Not the same blood type.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.373
Good work, Abby.

13:09.773 --> 13:12.273
McGee is going through
Heidi's records now.

13:13.273 --> 13:15.923
Problem is, because she
had so many fake identities,

13:15.958 --> 13:18.573
there's about ten times
the amount of normal data.

13:19.373 --> 13:21.973
Plus, most of the activity
is over three years old.

13:24.573 --> 13:28.073
But luckily, a snooper program I
was running did find one, two, three,

13:29.273 --> 13:32.273
four sizable deposits made
to her account recently

13:32.473 --> 13:35.473
from a man named... Adrian Nelson.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.573
Maybe that's another
boyfriend she conned.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.273
We'll let you know when we get back.

13:44.673 --> 13:46.073
Abby has to pee.

13:51.173 --> 13:52.473
Heidi Campisano.

13:53.173 --> 13:55.073
No, I'm sorry, I don't
recognize the name.

13:55.273 --> 13:57.773
Well, she's got a lot
of them, Mr. Nelson.

13:58.473 --> 13:59.473
Maybe.

13:59.873 --> 14:00.873
I travel a lot.

14:00.973 --> 14:01.973
Travel where?

14:02.173 --> 14:04.773
Trade shows. My husband's
a computer programmer.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.473
Well, I work in domotics.

14:07.173 --> 14:08.673
It's home automation.

14:09.073 --> 14:10.573
The application of...

14:10.673 --> 14:14.073
Automated techniques for the comfort
and security of the home resident.

14:15.173 --> 14:16.873
I can control the entire house.

14:17.673 --> 14:18.673
Lights...

14:20.273 --> 14:21.273
media...

14:23.073 --> 14:24.073
fireplace...

14:25.973 --> 14:28.973
even turn on the lawn sprinklers if
someone isn't supposed to be here.

14:30.073 --> 14:31.673
- Who is she?
- Who was she.

14:31.708 --> 14:32.773
She's dead, murdered.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.273
And her newborn is missing.

14:35.273 --> 14:36.773
Why are you telling us this?

14:36.873 --> 14:38.573
We've traced several recent

14:38.673 --> 14:41.373
deposits made to her
account from your husband.

14:41.673 --> 14:42.673
From me?

14:42.773 --> 14:44.673
Well, there's... there's
got to be some mistake.

14:44.973 --> 14:47.473
You said that she uses
a lot of names, right?

14:47.573 --> 14:49.273
Maybe she's stolen my identity.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.773
Like I said, I travel a lot.
It wouldn't be hard to do.

14:53.473 --> 14:54.573
I can settle this.

14:54.773 --> 14:55.973
Feel free to look around.

14:56.073 --> 14:58.773
But if my husband says he doesn't
know her, he doesn't know her.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.273
Right?

15:00.473 --> 15:01.573
That's right, honey.

15:03.773 --> 15:05.423
Well, that isn't supposed to happen.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.038
I'm going to have to reset the breaker.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.873
- Excuse me.
- Here, I'll give you some help.

15:10.773 --> 15:12.473
Reset switch is just in here.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.373
How long you been seeing Heidi?

15:19.973 --> 15:21.573
I told you, I don't know anything...

15:21.608 --> 15:22.873
No, you told your wife.

15:23.073 --> 15:24.273
And I let you.

15:24.373 --> 15:25.573
But now I get the truth.

15:29.873 --> 15:31.173
Just a few months.

15:32.073 --> 15:34.473
Till I found out she was
stealing money from me.

15:34.573 --> 15:36.638
She was forging my
signature on my checks.

15:36.673 --> 15:38.773
We barely saw each other
and we never slept together.

15:38.873 --> 15:40.773
- Baby's not yours.
- No, it's not.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.838
I need your DNA to verify that.

15:42.873 --> 15:46.273
Forget it. I'm not going on record that
I was ever involved with that woman.

15:46.373 --> 15:48.673
You need DNA, you're going
to have to talk to my lawyer.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.573
Maybe I'll just talk to your wife.

15:50.873 --> 15:53.773
Is your evidence that flimsy that
you have to resort to threats?

15:54.173 --> 15:56.373
I had nothing to do with
Heidi's murder, okay?

15:56.573 --> 15:59.973
But if you got something that says
I did, you should go get a warrant.

16:00.873 --> 16:01.873
Far enough?

16:03.073 --> 16:04.073
Oh, yeah.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.873
Yeah, I guess it'll have to be.

16:08.373 --> 16:09.373
Adrian.

16:11.773 --> 16:14.373
Everything's fine, honey. They're
going to show themselves out.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.273
- Everything's not fine.
- Got it?

16:17.773 --> 16:20.973
Fingernails clippings,
toothbrush swabs and Q-tips.

16:21.873 --> 16:22.973
He lied to us.

16:23.173 --> 16:25.973
This is a check to Heidi Campisano
from Adrian Nelson's account.

16:26.273 --> 16:28.673
This is a known sample
of his handwriting.

16:28.773 --> 16:29.973
The signature's real.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.173
Four checks.

16:31.273 --> 16:32.473
$10,000 total.

16:32.573 --> 16:33.973
Heidi didn't steal anything.

16:34.073 --> 16:35.673
Adrian sent her the money himself.

16:35.708 --> 16:36.890
Did more than that, McGee.

16:36.925 --> 16:38.073
Tried to hide it from us.

16:38.108 --> 16:38.838
DNA?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.238
Abby's still working on it.

16:40.273 --> 16:42.138
Come on, that's not what I'm saying.

16:42.173 --> 16:44.038
Boss, since we got a
pretty strong lead here,

16:44.073 --> 16:47.223
can Tony stop calling Heidi's
other marks looking for suspects?

16:47.258 --> 16:50.373
Listen, I am simply saying just
because she was lying to you,

16:50.473 --> 16:52.773
doesn't mean that she
didn't really love you.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.273
Hello?

17:00.073 --> 17:01.073
What?

17:01.973 --> 17:03.138
Let him call a few more.

17:03.173 --> 17:05.338
We have two theories to
explain the dishonesty.

17:05.373 --> 17:08.272
- Theory number one:
- Heidi Campisano seduced Adrian Nelson.

17:08.373 --> 17:10.673
Then blackmailed him
threatening to tell his wife.

17:10.772 --> 17:13.093
She had done it before plus,
it would explain the payments.

17:13.173 --> 17:14.873
And the fact she is now dead.

17:14.973 --> 17:18.272
Theory two: Adrian found out that
Heidi was pregnant with his baby.

17:18.373 --> 17:19.673
Also explain the payments.

17:19.708 --> 17:20.938
And the fact she is now dead.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.673
With those options,
I would've lied, too.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.373
But no doubt, more effectively.

17:24.673 --> 17:26.438
But thinking more optimistically,

17:26.473 --> 17:29.173
I took the liberty of
going out and getting this

17:29.273 --> 17:32.673
- for when you find our missing newborn.
- Any word?

17:32.773 --> 17:35.773
Yeah, I checked all the
hospitals in the area and beyond.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.473
No babies on any doorsteps.

17:38.573 --> 17:40.773
But you weren't expecting any, were you?

17:41.073 --> 17:42.473
Killer's got the baby, Ducky.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.973
Only way we're going to find
that kid is to find the killer.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.073
Okay, I'm on my way.

17:48.273 --> 17:49.673
You got something, DiNozzo?

17:50.073 --> 17:51.573
Yeah, dentist appointment.

17:55.473 --> 17:56.473
No...

17:57.373 --> 17:58.773
This is for real, guys.

17:58.973 --> 18:01.473
I... remember I chipped
my tooth and I got the...

18:02.673 --> 18:06.173
I'd sent you an e-mail for a leave
request, like, two days ago...

18:06.273 --> 18:07.373
about this.

18:08.173 --> 18:09.673
You don't check your e-mail.

18:10.273 --> 18:11.273
Never mind.

18:19.573 --> 18:22.773
Very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, Boy
Who Cried Wolf And Who Must Now Suffer.

18:22.808 --> 18:25.173
Periodontal Disease For
It. How may I help you?

18:25.273 --> 18:26.373
I've got something.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.473
Get down here.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.573
Okay. It's Abby. She's got something.

18:39.173 --> 18:40.173
Hi, Gibbs.

18:40.273 --> 18:42.623
Abby, I think you might need
to lay off the caffeine again.

18:42.658 --> 18:44.973
Maybe I need a little more,
McGee, you ever think of that?

18:45.073 --> 18:46.173
Baby missing.

18:46.773 --> 18:48.073
You said you had something.

18:48.173 --> 18:50.273
I do. That's what I'm so excited about.

18:50.373 --> 18:52.973
Actually, everything's
really exciting to me today.

18:54.373 --> 18:58.573
I was able to get the Nelsons'DNA off
the toothbrushes that McGee swabbed.

18:58.973 --> 19:02.773
I compared the husband's DNA to the
fetal DNA from the missing child.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.873
Adrian Nelson?

19:04.073 --> 19:05.173
Definitely the father.

19:05.373 --> 19:06.673
There's no shocker there.

19:06.773 --> 19:07.873
Well, I'm not done.

19:08.573 --> 19:09.773
Heidi Campisano?

19:10.473 --> 19:12.073
Definitely not the mother.

19:12.373 --> 19:15.273
She gave birth to a
child who is not hers?

19:15.373 --> 19:17.273
It's called gestational surrogacy,

19:17.373 --> 19:19.673
where the sperm and the
egg come from third parties

19:19.708 --> 19:21.673
and then the surrogate acts as a host.

19:21.773 --> 19:23.873
- Abs, did you check...?
- Sara Nelson's DNA?

19:24.273 --> 19:27.073
Sara Nelson is definitely the mother.

19:27.173 --> 19:28.573
That's what the payments were for.

19:28.673 --> 19:31.573
The Nelsons hired Heidi
Campisano as their surrogate.

19:31.773 --> 19:34.073
Perhaps she changed her mind
about giving up the baby.

19:34.108 --> 19:35.173
That's not the question.

19:35.273 --> 19:36.973
Did the Nelsons kill her for it?

19:53.773 --> 19:54.573
Clear.

19:54.673 --> 19:55.673
Clear.

19:56.273 --> 19:57.273
Clear.

19:57.373 --> 19:58.973
Looks like they left in a hurry.

19:59.773 --> 20:00.873
Place is a mess.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.073
Not all of it.

20:25.108 --> 20:27.708
I do not understand what
the Nelsons' plan was.

20:28.008 --> 20:29.208
To have a baby.

20:30.308 --> 20:31.608
That part I understand.

20:32.008 --> 20:34.508
That is why they hired Heidi
Campisano as a surrogate.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.308
But if she refused
to turn over the baby,

20:37.708 --> 20:41.308
I'm sure the Nelsons would've had
other options besides killing her.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.608
I mean, after all, they
were the biological parents.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.708
I'm not a lawyer.

20:45.508 --> 20:47.408
But you were a parent.

20:50.508 --> 20:52.808
You want to have children, Ziva?

20:54.208 --> 20:56.108
- Well...
- It's a simple question.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.608
I do not have a simple answer.

21:01.408 --> 21:04.808
Once you have kids, you'll understand.

21:05.808 --> 21:09.608
If the Nelsons were really
willing to do anything

21:09.708 --> 21:10.673
for their child,

21:10.708 --> 21:12.608
they would be getting
it medical attention.

21:12.708 --> 21:15.173
Yeah, well, maybe they
are. Safe was cleaned out.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.708
Plus, I found the box to an
infant car seat in the garage.

21:17.808 --> 21:20.708
- There going somewhere with the kid.
- You go for a swim, DiNozzo?

21:21.108 --> 21:22.208
Oh, yeah.

21:22.508 --> 21:25.308
Sprinklers went off when I was
digging through the trash outside.

21:25.608 --> 21:26.708
Nice timing.

21:26.908 --> 21:28.908
Actually, it's part of
their security system.

21:29.008 --> 21:32.208
Forgot to warn you about that. Boss,
found something on their computer.

21:33.408 --> 21:35.608
Thanks for the heads up,
probie. I owe you one.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.173
I love you.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.008
Now you need to figure out
if you feel the same way.

21:46.108 --> 21:48.308
I don't want to hurt
you. I can't live a lie.

21:52.408 --> 21:53.508
Tony, I...

22:00.008 --> 22:02.208
Adrian Nelson is covering his tracks.

22:02.308 --> 22:04.208
He erased his entire hard drive.

22:04.508 --> 22:06.608
So we can't see what he's been doing.

22:07.008 --> 22:08.808
I thought you said you found something.

22:09.308 --> 22:11.108
Yeah, the root directory's still intact.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.808
There's no personal data, but I did
find an API he had written to interface

22:14.908 --> 22:18.408
his home automation system to his
car's on board navigation computer.

22:20.608 --> 22:23.508
Pretend you're talking to someone who
actually has sex with other humans.

22:24.608 --> 22:25.884
All I have to do is hack the API

22:25.908 --> 22:28.108
and I can use it to get the
GPS coordinates on his car.

22:28.208 --> 22:29.208
Yeah, do it, do it.

22:29.308 --> 22:32.508
This is great. It means I can
stop calling Heidi's marks.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.208
I mean, of course, I will look
for those other guys, but...

22:37.908 --> 22:39.808
Sorry. Sorry.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.408
They haven't moved in
the last 20 minutes.

22:46.608 --> 22:48.008
Might have dumped the car.

22:48.608 --> 22:50.908
Gibbs and the state police
will know soon enough.

22:52.608 --> 22:53.908
What are you still typing?

22:54.008 --> 22:55.608
I'm refreshing the tracker.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.608
Forget it I don't want to know.
It's good to have a geek on the team

22:58.708 --> 23:00.808
but I prefer good
old-fashioned police work.

23:01.008 --> 23:03.008
Well, it's not an
old-fashioned world, Tony.

23:03.043 --> 23:04.208
Tell that to Gibbs.

23:14.408 --> 23:15.508
What was it like?

23:18.308 --> 23:20.208
Sex? Losing your virginity?

23:20.408 --> 23:21.408
It's good.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.308
Pretending to be someone else.

23:23.808 --> 23:25.608
I don't know, Elf Lord.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.608
You were really in love
with her, weren't you?

23:36.608 --> 23:38.808
Don't you have some more
typing to do or something?

23:38.843 --> 23:39.908
Yeah, he does.

23:41.008 --> 23:42.008
Car wasn't there.

23:43.408 --> 23:44.708
What? What...

23:44.808 --> 23:46.108
I double-checked the...

23:47.008 --> 23:48.908
All right, I think I
know what happened here.

23:49.608 --> 23:52.708
20 bucks says McGee's about to say
something nobody understands again.

23:53.008 --> 23:56.108
The GPS coordinates came
bundled in a proprietary packet.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.208
Since it was a beta...

23:57.308 --> 23:59.908
I'm starting to think you
can't help yourself, McGee.

24:00.308 --> 24:03.508
The code must have alerted Adrian
Nelson that I was tracking him.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.608
He reprogrammed his car to
send us back false coordinates.

24:06.643 --> 24:08.408
Can you deprogram it, McGee?

24:08.708 --> 24:09.673
I can try.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.558
Well, while he tries,
I'm going to resort

24:11.593 --> 24:13.408
to some good old-fashioned police work.

24:13.443 --> 24:14.443
Look.

24:15.008 --> 24:16.008
What's that?

24:22.908 --> 24:24.008
Who are you calling?

24:25.808 --> 24:26.808
Donny.

24:26.908 --> 24:28.308
- Hey. DiNozzo.
- Hey, man.

24:28.343 --> 24:29.673
Yeah, man, what's going on?

24:29.708 --> 24:31.608
Listen, I got an update
on a BOLO. Missing kid.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.308
- Give it to me.
- Dead Head sticker.

24:33.343 --> 24:34.508
Excellent. Where?

24:34.808 --> 24:35.908
Left rear window.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.808
Nice. Remember Saturday night

24:37.908 --> 24:39.808
I know, man... That was good times.

24:40.008 --> 24:42.008
I got another call, I really got to go.

24:42.043 --> 24:43.308
Hang tough, Donny.

24:44.908 --> 24:48.008
Old-fashion police work
deserves an old-fashion reward.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.708
Interrogation got a little
out of hand. I had to...

25:21.208 --> 25:22.408
I can't explain that.

25:25.608 --> 25:26.608
Hello.

25:28.808 --> 25:29.808
Again.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.708
You know, I saw this on... Cinemax once.

25:37.908 --> 25:39.008
So, what happens now?

25:39.208 --> 25:41.208
They play some funky
music, and then you say

25:41.508 --> 25:43.608
"I have been watching you from afar."

25:43.908 --> 25:45.873
Well, I've been watching you from afar,

25:45.908 --> 25:48.208
which is why I know how
much you cared for Jeanne.

25:52.108 --> 25:53.708
Your timing is impeccable.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.908
And how much it hurt when she left.

25:57.708 --> 25:58.708
So,

25:59.008 --> 26:00.008
what happens now?

26:01.608 --> 26:02.608
I said I'm fine.

26:11.908 --> 26:12.908
You are not fine.

26:13.908 --> 26:15.608
You are still deeply troubled.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.008
Even if I was,

26:17.108 --> 26:19.308
this bothers you because...?

26:19.408 --> 26:20.808
Because you are my partner.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.408
And because you made a
grave error in judgment

26:25.443 --> 26:26.773
falling in love with that girl.

26:26.808 --> 26:29.008
If this is a pep talk,
I give you a D-minus.

26:29.108 --> 26:31.908
And right now, it is very clear
you are still hanging on to her.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.208
I see the confusion.

26:33.608 --> 26:35.208
These are called feelings, Ziva.

26:35.243 --> 26:36.808
Feelings you need to let go.

26:37.808 --> 26:38.808
That easy?

26:41.108 --> 26:43.308
Even if by some miracle
Jeanne did forgive you,

26:43.343 --> 26:45.508
would you be willing to
be Tony DiNardo full-time?

26:45.608 --> 26:47.608
To leave your entire
life behind for her?

26:50.808 --> 26:52.608
You did not think this through.

26:53.408 --> 26:55.908
Didn't you tell me the
heart wants what it wants.

26:55.943 --> 26:56.943
No.

26:57.908 --> 26:58.908
Actually, I didn't.

27:00.808 --> 27:01.808
Well, it does.

27:04.108 --> 27:05.208
Well, it shouldn't.

27:05.908 --> 27:06.908
Really.

27:08.308 --> 27:09.473
This coming from the woman

27:09.508 --> 27:11.808
who fell in love with
the dead man walking.

27:20.408 --> 27:21.908
You crossed the line, Tony.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.808
I crossed the line?

27:26.908 --> 27:27.908
Don't ask.

27:28.408 --> 27:29.408
Wasn't going to.

27:30.908 --> 27:32.008
BOLO just came in,

27:32.508 --> 27:33.608
they found the car.

27:35.408 --> 27:36.508
Jelly Donut, one.

27:36.808 --> 27:38.108
Inspector Gadget, zero.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.408
Not the BOLO on the Nelsons' car.

27:40.508 --> 27:42.408
The BOLO on the dead petty officer's.

27:45.108 --> 27:47.108
Nothing here. The
truck's been wiped clean.

27:47.308 --> 27:49.508
And someone's stolen our
petty officer's blood stain.

27:49.708 --> 27:50.908
It was also cleaned.

27:51.308 --> 27:53.808
Or we're wrong about
where Munoz was shot.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.008
Witnesses.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.508
No witnesses.

27:58.808 --> 28:01.408
Local LEOs found the truck
abandoned near a forest preserve.

28:01.443 --> 28:02.808
It couldn't have been there long.

28:02.843 --> 28:03.908
How would you know that?

28:04.208 --> 28:06.008
Wait. I forgot...

28:06.308 --> 28:08.708
you know everything about everybody.

28:08.808 --> 28:11.008
Sap. Ziva there'd be
more sap on the roof.

28:11.108 --> 28:13.708
Except for the fact
it rained last night.

28:13.808 --> 28:15.908
Do I need to send you two
back to the men's room?

28:16.108 --> 28:17.373
She followed me in there!

28:17.408 --> 28:19.108
Only because you wouldn't talk to me.

28:23.008 --> 28:24.108
Shutting up, boss.

28:24.908 --> 28:25.908
Ready?

28:44.208 --> 28:47.508
So much for being wrong about
where Petty Officer Munoz was shot.

28:50.608 --> 28:51.808
We got footprints.

28:52.108 --> 28:53.408
Yeah, question is, whose?

28:53.508 --> 28:55.408
Petty Officer Munoz was a size 13.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.908
Those look like a size 13 to you?

28:58.008 --> 28:59.208
Send them up to Abby.

28:59.708 --> 29:02.308
The prints were made by a
residue of polysaccharide dust

29:02.343 --> 29:03.573
derived from beta-glucose.

29:03.608 --> 29:07.308
What makes it interesting is
the backbone of D-xylopyranose,

29:07.343 --> 29:09.708
linked with eight
xylose units. Panda poop.

29:11.008 --> 29:12.208
- Panda...
- Poop.

29:12.308 --> 29:14.508
Which is why it fluoresces,
like all other poop does.

29:14.708 --> 29:16.508
What makes it really,
really, interesting...

29:17.408 --> 29:18.908
is the sodium hypochlorite.

29:19.208 --> 29:20.708
Aka Chlorine bleach.

29:23.708 --> 29:24.908
I lost you at poop?

29:26.008 --> 29:27.108
Paper, Gibbs.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.008
A while ago, a group of Chinese
researchers decided to try

29:31.043 --> 29:33.408
to recycle panda poop
into high-quality paper.

29:33.708 --> 29:36.908
They contracted several U.S. paper
mills to develop the research.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.028
Killer must have gone to
one after he shot Munoz.

29:39.108 --> 29:41.508
The dust from the mill would've
been impossible to avoid.

29:41.908 --> 29:43.508
There's one within a hundred miles.

29:43.808 --> 29:45.108
Closed down six months ago.

29:52.608 --> 29:53.908
I love my job!

29:58.208 --> 29:59.908
You're telling me I'm the only who has

29:59.943 --> 30:01.608
a problem with the panda poop paper?

30:01.908 --> 30:04.308
Actually, animal dung's
used for a variety of things:

30:04.408 --> 30:06.008
Paper, fuel, mud bricks.

30:06.308 --> 30:07.308
It's very useful.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.408
Not for them, it wasn't.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.308
This place is abandoned.

30:12.908 --> 30:14.208
Not quite, Ziva.

30:25.208 --> 30:26.308
Honey, let me get it.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.308
- DiNozzo.
- In position, boss.

30:29.108 --> 30:30.108
Federal agents!

30:30.508 --> 30:32.408
NCIS! Hands in the air!

30:33.308 --> 30:35.008
Agent Gibbs, please, you have to leave!

30:35.308 --> 30:36.808
My God, you'll ruin everything!

30:40.908 --> 30:42.108
You've got to stop him.

30:42.143 --> 30:43.143
My baby!

30:43.808 --> 30:45.108
They've got my baby!

30:45.508 --> 30:46.508
It's okay. Honey.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.638
At least probie has an
idea for his next book.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.038
Baby kidnapped, cops
screw up ransom drop.

31:07.438 --> 31:09.338
Let me know asap if
the situation changes.

31:09.373 --> 31:11.238
The Nelsons hid the kidnapping from us,

31:11.338 --> 31:13.438
Agent DiNozzo, the mistake was theirs.

31:13.938 --> 31:16.538
Well, you should point that
out to Gibbs, Officer David.

31:16.573 --> 31:17.738
I'll be in the next zip code.

31:18.738 --> 31:20.103
Agents are still out canvassing.

31:20.138 --> 31:22.138
No one saw the Honda,
much less who was driving.

31:22.173 --> 31:23.203
Keep looking. DiNozzo.

31:23.238 --> 31:25.538
Taps on the Nelsons' phones,
I'm on it, boss, right now.

31:27.738 --> 31:29.038
And I still have a...

31:29.438 --> 31:31.638
a few more of Heidi's marks
that I have to track down.

31:32.038 --> 31:33.538
That's next. That's right after...

31:33.638 --> 31:34.638
I'm on it.

31:35.238 --> 31:38.038
Coordinate with state police,
see if we can widen the search.

31:38.338 --> 31:39.738
Hi, this is Special Agent...

31:41.538 --> 31:44.038
You think the kidnappers will
call to arrange another ransom?

31:44.238 --> 31:45.538
What's the option, McGee?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.338
I'll see about getting
more agents on the canvass.

31:48.838 --> 31:50.538
We already have the entire department.

31:53.938 --> 31:57.038
All I know is, we got a call
saying that Heidi was dead,

31:57.073 --> 31:58.838
and that if we ever
want to see our baby,

31:58.873 --> 32:01.038
we needed to come up with $50,000.

32:01.138 --> 32:03.438
Which we did, until you ruined it.

32:04.738 --> 32:06.438
How much longer do we have to sit here?

32:06.638 --> 32:08.538
- That depends.
- On what?

32:09.038 --> 32:11.638
Whether or not I get
the truth this time.

32:11.838 --> 32:13.638
Don't you have something
you could be doing?

32:13.838 --> 32:14.838
Like...

32:15.238 --> 32:16.638
finding my child?

32:20.838 --> 32:23.638
My wife had a partial
hysterectomy four years ago.

32:24.138 --> 32:25.303
We tried to adopt and...

32:25.338 --> 32:27.338
Went all the way to
Southeast Asia and back.

32:27.538 --> 32:28.838
And then we met Heidi.

32:29.538 --> 32:30.838
My exact opposite.

32:31.038 --> 32:32.938
She had a womb but no eggs.

32:34.538 --> 32:35.738
She was a life-saver,

32:36.038 --> 32:37.838
- it was almost...
- Too good to be true?

32:39.038 --> 32:40.338
Then it usually is.

32:41.538 --> 32:43.438
We already knew her
background, Agent Gibbs.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.538
You still think she
was trying to con us?

32:45.573 --> 32:46.573
You paid her.

32:48.338 --> 32:50.138
Paid surrogacy's illegal in Virginia.

32:50.238 --> 32:51.838
That why you didn't go to the police?

32:55.138 --> 32:57.638
Look, I got all day.
Your kid is missing.

32:57.938 --> 33:00.638
We didn't go to the police because
we knew they'd screw things up.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.338
And you've still got it wrong.

33:02.373 --> 33:04.038
Heidi was our friend.

33:04.138 --> 33:05.538
We were happy to pay.

33:05.838 --> 33:07.038
And she needed the money.

33:07.338 --> 33:08.738
Then she decided she wanted more.

33:09.438 --> 33:11.538
This may have been her, but not anymore.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.305
She was trying to start over.

33:13.340 --> 33:15.038
Someone wouldn't let her. Who?!

33:15.138 --> 33:18.438
I have no idea! I don't
know who has my child!

33:20.638 --> 33:22.038
But as far as I'm concerned,

33:22.338 --> 33:24.338
if anything happens to my child,

33:24.438 --> 33:26.238
you're the one who better run for cover.

33:29.238 --> 33:31.038
No satellite coverage of the paper mill.

33:31.138 --> 33:32.438
Nothing on the traffic cams.

33:32.538 --> 33:33.538
All right, send it over.

33:35.838 --> 33:38.338
Careful over there. Wouldn't
want to break a finger.

33:44.238 --> 33:45.938
Gibbs does not accept apologies,

33:46.638 --> 33:47.838
but I do.

33:56.638 --> 33:58.738
I'm sorry, Ziva. I know
you were trying to help.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.538
Did I?

34:03.538 --> 34:04.838
I'll get back to you

34:05.738 --> 34:07.138
after I shame McGee.

34:07.538 --> 34:08.737
Did you find something?

34:10.838 --> 34:13.338
I've been compiling a list
of Heidi's former marks.

34:13.438 --> 34:14.438
We've noticed.

34:15.737 --> 34:17.538
Any one of them could
have a score to settle.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.737
The problem is they all
have solid alibis for the day

34:19.838 --> 34:21.938
that Heidi was killed, except this guy.

34:22.438 --> 34:23.737
Scott Berks.

34:23.838 --> 34:26.237
Filed a complaint over a
pyramid scheme Heidi was running.

34:26.338 --> 34:27.638
Where does he say he was?

34:28.638 --> 34:29.737
Well, he doesn't.

34:30.338 --> 34:31.503
I haven't found him yet.

34:31.538 --> 34:34.638
Does not exactly look
like a score settler to me.

34:35.138 --> 34:36.538
No. How about now?

34:37.538 --> 34:39.603
A buddy at Baltimore
PD just sent this over.

34:39.638 --> 34:42.237
Turns out this guy also filed
a complaint against Heidi.

34:43.038 --> 34:44.902
- It is the same person.
- It's called a shill.

34:44.938 --> 34:47.138
They're part of the con,
but they pose as a customer

34:47.172 --> 34:49.338
to try to convince the
other marks to jump in.

34:49.638 --> 34:52.237
If the con goes bad, they'll
often file a complaint

34:52.338 --> 34:54.237
so it builds credibility
with the other marks.

34:54.338 --> 34:56.538
Then they can move in
for a secondary con.

34:57.938 --> 34:59.938
I used to date this guy once...

35:01.238 --> 35:02.538
He was Heidi's partner.

35:03.338 --> 35:04.538
Yeah, might still be.

35:04.638 --> 35:07.238
High five for the
traditional police work.

35:07.938 --> 35:08.938
Tony, he's dead.

35:09.538 --> 35:11.238
Killed a year ago by one of his marks.

35:11.438 --> 35:14.038
You might want to brush up on
the traditional police work.

35:15.438 --> 35:17.638
Do you know where my killer is?!

35:18.038 --> 35:20.038
I don't know where the
killer is, but I know

35:20.073 --> 35:22.038
what he was planning on
doing with Heidi's body.

35:25.838 --> 35:28.638
Since the Chevy didn't leave any
skid marks at the site of the accident

35:28.673 --> 35:30.438
the first thing I did
was check the brakes.

35:31.538 --> 35:32.638
The line were intact

35:33.338 --> 35:34.738
and the fluids were topped off.

35:35.038 --> 35:37.238
The pads were bad. They
needed to be replaced.

35:37.538 --> 35:38.803
I know, but here's the thing.

35:38.838 --> 35:40.538
This is so good, I can hardly take it.

35:40.738 --> 35:43.038
The brakes were replaced
about two weeks ago.

35:43.238 --> 35:46.238
I found metallic shavings in
the brake drum and the caliper.

35:46.338 --> 35:48.303
It only could have come
from new pads and shoes.

35:48.338 --> 35:50.738
Brakes were replaced and then
the old ones were put back on?

35:51.038 --> 35:53.238
Yes, the accident was not an accident.

35:53.538 --> 35:55.838
Well, actually, it was,
it just happened too soon.

35:56.138 --> 35:57.438
It was the perfect cover-up.

35:57.538 --> 36:00.738
The killer probably planned on putting
Heidi's body behind the wheel of the car

36:00.773 --> 36:01.814
and sending it over a cliff.

36:01.838 --> 36:05.138
- It'd have covered up the murder.
- It'd have been blamed on worn brakes.

36:05.238 --> 36:07.338
The only problem is the
killer cut it too close.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.803
The brakes went out and ka-bam.

36:08.838 --> 36:11.938
So who would rely on
the mechanical failure

36:12.138 --> 36:15.838
of a break pad compressed against
a disc rotor to hide a body?

36:30.238 --> 36:31.938
What did my loser son do now?

36:31.973 --> 36:33.638
He killed Heidi Campisano.

36:33.838 --> 36:36.838
Then tried to ransom her baby
back to the biological parents.

36:37.938 --> 36:39.338
My boy ain't that clever.

36:39.438 --> 36:41.038
Guess that's why he needed your help.

36:42.938 --> 36:45.338
Look, I told you he was
here with me all day.

36:45.738 --> 36:47.538
Yeah, and your customers confirmed that.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.738
But nobody we spoke to saw you.

36:49.838 --> 36:52.038
A witness did see you in this Honda

36:52.238 --> 36:53.938
near the Stern Paper
Mill this afternoon.

36:54.138 --> 36:57.438
Seems you two are more than
just father-and-son mechanics.

36:57.638 --> 36:58.738
Nice shotgun.

36:59.438 --> 37:01.438
Shoot any naval petty officers lately?

37:03.338 --> 37:04.338
Where's the baby?

37:06.738 --> 37:09.238
I don't know what you're talking
about. I was at a paper mill.

37:09.273 --> 37:10.938
What's that, some kind of a crime?

37:15.338 --> 37:16.338
Baby!

37:18.838 --> 37:19.938
The baby's with Nicky.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.038
And Nicky?

37:21.838 --> 37:23.703
I told him to wait here for me to call,

37:23.738 --> 37:25.838
but my moron son never
does what he's told!

37:26.538 --> 37:27.738
BOLO on it, boss.

37:28.138 --> 37:30.438
That girl of his was never
going to give up that baby.

37:30.473 --> 37:32.138
I was doing those parents a favor!

37:32.638 --> 37:34.838
You're under arrest for the
murder of Heidi Campisano.

37:35.138 --> 37:37.003
Come on! That was an accident!

37:37.038 --> 37:39.638
Petty Officer Munoz,
that an accident, too?

37:39.738 --> 37:41.838
Because his murder is
also in our warrant.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.938
- Look, when my brakes gave out...
- You mean

37:45.138 --> 37:46.738
when you rigged them to go out.

37:47.838 --> 37:50.638
You replaced Heidi's brakes with
a set that were about to fail,

37:50.673 --> 37:52.438
and make it look like
she died in a crash.

37:55.538 --> 37:57.138
That little son of a bitch!

37:57.238 --> 37:58.338
I'm going to kill him!

37:58.438 --> 38:00.538
After all I've done
for that little bastard!

38:00.573 --> 38:02.305
He didn't know the brakes were rigged?

38:02.340 --> 38:04.038
No, he didn't. Cancel
that BOLO, DiNozzo.

38:09.038 --> 38:11.638
London Bridge is falling down,

38:12.138 --> 38:13.338
falling down,

38:14.038 --> 38:15.738
falling down,

38:16.938 --> 38:19.438
London Bridge is falling down,

38:19.938 --> 38:22.638
my fair baby.

38:30.238 --> 38:31.438
You got my pa?

38:33.338 --> 38:35.938
He killed Heidi, made
me lie to you about her.

38:36.638 --> 38:37.638
I know.

38:40.838 --> 38:42.138
She didn't cheat on me.

38:43.038 --> 38:44.238
She wasn't bad no more.

38:46.938 --> 38:49.038
We were even going to
start a family together.

38:50.338 --> 38:52.538
Except Heidi couldn't
have no kids of her own.

38:55.738 --> 38:56.938
She was smart, though.

38:57.338 --> 38:58.838
Figured out a way to get one.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.138
Guess that part was bad.

39:01.838 --> 39:03.338
Wish I could tell you it wasn't.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.238
I would have raised my own boy right.

39:12.738 --> 39:13.938
When the baby was born,

39:14.238 --> 39:15.938
we were planning to run away,

39:17.538 --> 39:20.738
but my pa wanted the rest of
the money we were going to get.

39:22.638 --> 39:23.938
Heidi and him fought,

39:24.338 --> 39:26.438
then she had the baby...

39:33.038 --> 39:36.938
My pa took it, she was screaming.

39:39.738 --> 39:41.038
And you didn't do a thing.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.338
I did.

39:44.638 --> 39:46.338
It was just too late to matter.

39:46.938 --> 39:47.938
The brakes.

39:50.838 --> 39:51.838
Am I in trouble?

39:52.338 --> 39:54.298
Prosecution's going to
call it "attempted murder".

39:54.323 --> 39:56.238
Your lawyer's going to
call it "self-defense".

39:57.238 --> 39:58.338
What do you call it?

40:00.538 --> 40:01.538
Family.

40:09.438 --> 40:10.638
Is everything okay?

40:10.838 --> 40:12.138
It's the sprinkler again.

40:12.338 --> 40:13.738
Parents are waiting outside.

40:38.138 --> 40:39.438
You think I'm crazy?

40:48.238 --> 40:49.238
Here's your baby.

40:51.438 --> 40:52.438
Oh, my God!

40:55.238 --> 40:56.238
Thank you.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.538
Thank you.

41:02.538 --> 41:03.538
It's a boy.

41:20.138 --> 41:21.238
Here you go, Tony.

41:38.338 --> 41:39.338
Look at him.

42:00.438 --> 42:03.738
Tony, I'm not coming back.
You need to choose, Jeanne.
