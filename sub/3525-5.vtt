00:09.200 --> 00:12.100
# You woke up
this morning #

00:12.135 --> 00:14.500
# Got yourself a gun #

00:14.600 --> 00:18.350
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:18.385 --> 00:22.100
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:22.135 --> 00:24.365
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:24.400 --> 00:27.400
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:27.500 --> 00:30.250
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:30.285 --> 00:33.092
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:33.127 --> 00:36.113
# And all that love
had gone #

00:36.148 --> 00:39.100
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:39.135 --> 00:41.565
# Right and wrong #

00:41.600 --> 00:43.900
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

00:43.935 --> 00:46.467
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

00:46.502 --> 00:49.000
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:49.035 --> 00:51.465
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:51.500 --> 00:54.700
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:54.800 --> 00:58.300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
# Woke up this morning #

01:02.400 --> 01:05.099
# You say you woke up
this morning #

01:05.135 --> 01:07.800
# The world
turned upside down #

01:07.900 --> 01:10.100
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:10.135 --> 01:13.365
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:13.400 --> 01:15.800
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:15.835 --> 01:18.200
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:18.300 --> 01:21.300
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:21.335 --> 01:24.300
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:24.335 --> 01:27.265
# Woke up
this morning #

01:27.300 --> 01:30.465
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:30.500 --> 01:33.500
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

01:33.535 --> 01:36.000

02:01.600 --> 02:03.700
- Dad.
- Hey.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.700
What are
you doing here?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.600
Well, I got
an office here.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.200
- You come down with Finn?
- And some people.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.600
Promise me no drinkin'
and drivin'.

02:14.700 --> 02:17.400
Who's your
designated driver?

02:17.500 --> 02:20.100
I'm not the one with all
the dents in their car.

02:20.135 --> 02:22.700
All right,
have fun, huh?

02:22.735 --> 02:24.765
Need some money?

02:24.800 --> 02:27.300
Have a good time,
sweetheart.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.500
Be careful!

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
- You see Meadow?
- Yeah, I wish I knew she was here.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.400
I wonder what the fuck
she's thinkin'.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.100
I'm sorry, Ton'. Some kid
had a seizure upstairs,

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
- it's been a horrible night.
- Hey, Ton',

02:47.300 --> 02:49.900
Vito and Gene just called,
they're five minutes away.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
We're leaving.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.500
Here. All right, call 'em
and tell 'em to meet us

02:55.535 --> 02:58.400
at Bud's Butter Bun
on Broadway and 18th.

02:58.435 --> 03:01.300
All right.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.600
Did I just
see your father?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.800
He's got
an office here.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.200
Saturday night?

03:14.235 --> 03:16.465
That's dedication.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
The guy sure can
put in the hours.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.465
Let's go
someplace else.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.200
Tony's spendin'
so much time at the club.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.900
Do you think that might have
something to do with you?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.565
Oh, if you think
I'm gonna blow this guy

03:31.600 --> 03:34.600
for your sick purposes
you are sadly mistaken.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.400
So go on about this phone call
the other night.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.200
It was just some guy
with a Southern accent.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.000
Christopher
grabbed the phone,

03:43.100 --> 03:44.865
he yelled at him
for callin' the house,

03:44.900 --> 03:48.000
- said he'd see him down there.
- Down where?

03:48.035 --> 03:49.800
Did you check
the log on his cell?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.800
Not since I almost
got caught doin' that,

03:51.835 --> 03:53.565
and I am not
doin' it again.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.250
Wait till he goes
into the shower.

03:56.285 --> 03:58.865
See if there's
a 4-0-4 or 3-3-6,

03:58.900 --> 04:01.400
and memorize any other numbers
you don't recognize.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.400
- What's the matter?
- I got to go to the bathroom.

04:06.435 --> 04:09.500
- I know, you said.
- No, I-I got to go.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.700
- Number two.
- I'll take you to your car.

04:13.735 --> 04:16.899
No, I got to go now.
Oh my God.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.065
You okay?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.200
We're almost there.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.200
Try to relax.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.600
Don't you got a general
anesthetic or somethin'?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.600
This lidocaine
doesn't do much.

04:30.635 --> 04:33.900
We are... done.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.400
Jan, want to do
your thing?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.950
Just keep
a little pressure.

04:42.985 --> 04:45.192
All right.
I'm gonna get this

04:45.227 --> 04:47.400
down to the lab,
see what's what.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.665
Okay.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.500
There we go.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.200
- You okay?
- You think he got it all?

04:56.300 --> 04:59.400
We hope so. Meantime,
there's a canteen on Level L.

04:59.435 --> 05:01.800
I'll let you know when
the results come back.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.700
Does having a bowel movement
relieve the pain?

05:08.735 --> 05:10.665
Yeah.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.200
Would you describe
the diarrhea

05:13.235 --> 05:15.267
- as loose or liquid?
- Liquid.

05:15.302 --> 05:17.300
But this is gettin'
so I'm afraid

05:17.335 --> 05:18.700
to be away
from the toilet.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
I'm so scared
I'm gonna have an accident.

05:20.835 --> 05:23.600
- Is this tender?
- No.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
Sit up.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.400
- How's your personal life?
- What do you mean?

05:36.435 --> 05:39.465
Well, sometimes GI disturbances
are stress-related.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.700
Is there anything unusual
that might be giving you the jimjams?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.600
I just want somethin'
for my stomach

05:48.700 --> 05:50.400
so I can quit
goin' to the bathroom.

05:50.435 --> 05:52.265
That's what's
givin' me stress.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
Why don't you get dressed?
We'll talk in my office.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.000
I hear you're spending time
with today's youth.

06:03.035 --> 06:05.165
You lost me.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.300
Meadow said she saw you
at Adriana's club.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.300
I got to explain my business to you now?
After so many years?

06:11.335 --> 06:14.767
- No, it's your life, Tony.
- Got that right.

06:14.802 --> 06:18.165
What did you do to your head?
Did you fall again?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.800
Banged it on the medicine chest.
Don't worry 'bout it.

06:20.835 --> 06:24.100
It's nothin'.
There's your allowance.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.500
Now that actually
looks like fruit.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.500
Yeah, it's so hard.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.800
What do you
do it for?

06:49.900 --> 06:51.800
Irritable bowel syndrome?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.800
He'll know more when
the tests come back.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.200
I still got to bring him
a stool sample.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.765
Jesus, please.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.900
You were the one who yelled
at me to go to the doctor.

07:00.935 --> 07:03.365
I got to know
every detail?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.265
I could be really sick,
Christopher.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.600
Yeah, my Aunt Josephine
had colon cancer.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.550
Her whole asshole
rotted out.

07:10.585 --> 07:13.400
I may have
to go into therapy.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.400
Plus, they're gonna
put me on Prozac.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.465
For diarrhea?

07:17.500 --> 07:20.800
To help me cope
and handle stress,

07:20.900 --> 07:22.900
which is a lot
of what causes it.

07:22.935 --> 07:24.900
What do you got to
be stressed about?

07:24.935 --> 07:27.165
That bar?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.400
War, Christopher?

07:29.435 --> 07:31.565
The Middle East?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.565
You don't listen
to the President?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.200
We're gonna mop the floor
with the whole fuckin' world.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.400
The whole world's
gonna be under our control,

07:38.435 --> 07:40.400
so what are you
worked up about?

07:55.200 --> 07:56.600
Oh, give me the Orioles
over the Tigers for two,

07:56.700 --> 07:59.000
and the Jays over
the Rangers, three G's.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.000
I'm just gettin'
my day planner.

08:08.035 --> 08:10.200
No, I'm done.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.865
My stupid car.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.400
5,000 miles
and the alternator's goin'.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.600
What about you?
Mimi said you went to the doctor.

08:27.635 --> 08:29.767
I've been havin'
trouble with my stomach,

08:29.802 --> 08:31.900
that's why I'm drinkin'
White Russians.

08:31.935 --> 08:34.917
What, you got
ulcers already?

08:34.952 --> 08:37.900
- It's called IBS.
- What's that?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.400
Irritable bowel syndrome.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.800
My mother had that
all her life.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.200
See this?

08:51.300 --> 08:54.000
- Yeah, I noticed that. What happened?
- It's cancer.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.250
- What?
- Yeah, squamous.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.365
Oh my God,
that's terrible.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.900
Well, they think they got it all.
Knock wood.

09:00.935 --> 09:02.500
Just cancer.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.900
The things that run
through your head, you know?

09:05.935 --> 09:08.900
- Sure.
- I got a top guy, though...

09:08.935 --> 09:10.965
Katz.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Hesh recommended him,
naturally.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.565
So this...

09:18.600 --> 09:20.500
disease you got.

09:20.535 --> 09:22.400
What causes it?

09:22.500 --> 09:25.200
I did a Google on it
and like the doctor, too.

09:25.235 --> 09:27.200
They all say a lot
of it's psychological.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.700
So on top of everything,
now I'm a head case.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.700
No, come on,
stop blamin' yourself.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.600
Christopher
don't want to know,

09:37.635 --> 09:39.600
but not that I blame him.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.965
I got to take off.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.600
AJ should be comin' home
from his volleyball thing.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.565
Listen, don't say
anything to anybody, okay?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.400
People hear cancer,
they start to bury you already.

09:59.435 --> 10:01.900
And you don't tell
anybody what I told you.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.200
All right, take care
of yourself.

10:06.235 --> 10:08.365
Say hi to Anthony.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.500
- Yeah.
- You're such a good father.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.500
I wish my dad
had been like that.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.800
Good night, dear.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.700
It's a straight shot
on I-95 to Raleigh.

10:21.735 --> 10:23.717
You give this shit
to the fence,

10:23.752 --> 10:25.665
I'll meet you
in Winston-Salem,

10:25.700 --> 10:27.500
we'll load up the cigs
and come home.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.265
We're pickin' up
so many cigarettes,

10:29.300 --> 10:31.900
why don't we instead of two vans
rent a deuce and a half?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.865
You know,
share the drivin'.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.065
Because the cops...
The van's under the radar.

10:37.100 --> 10:40.200
- Eric Estrada over here.
- You forgot your folic acid.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.550
What is
all this stuff?

10:42.585 --> 10:44.800
A beauty parlor chair?

10:44.900 --> 10:47.265
If they even heard of
electrolysis down there.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.700
- Where are you goin'?
- Jesus Christ, go back to bed.

10:50.735 --> 10:52.767
What the fuck's
your problem?

10:52.802 --> 10:54.765
My fuckin' tooth
is killin' me.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.200
Well, you should
go back to the dentist.

10:57.235 --> 10:59.165
Why do you have
to go anyway?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.000
Can't they just
drop this stuff off?

11:01.100 --> 11:03.200
Tony wants me to talk
to the guy down there.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.200
The jerk you were
yellin' at on the phone?

11:05.300 --> 11:08.100
Is that the cigarette thing
you were talkin' about?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.600
Six different kinds of dope you get
to take for a stomach-ache,

11:11.700 --> 11:15.200
I got an impaction, I can't take shit
besides oil of clove, 'cause I'm sober.

11:15.235 --> 11:18.700
I know, it's hard. I'm sorry.
Have a nice trip.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.100
- I love you, call me.
- She's got diarrhea.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.800
Whoops.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.765
You want?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.000
Aw, twist my arm.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.200
I'm expectin' some guys
from New York, so...

11:44.235 --> 11:47.400
No problem.
I got plenty to do out there.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.450
- Ah. Who's this on?
- Please. It's called "The Lost Boys. "

11:53.485 --> 11:56.700
Sil's been raggin' on me all week
for me to play 'em here.

11:56.735 --> 11:59.300
Their manager or somebody
owes him money.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.200
So, I thought
this was your day off.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.665
Chrissy's away.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.100
I don't like
stayin' home alone.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.300
Although, at least
I can pour a glass of wine

12:12.400 --> 12:14.800
without him givin' me
"the expression. "

12:16.400 --> 12:18.900
Yeah. Yeah, I know
that look.

12:18.935 --> 12:21.500
The constipated owl look.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.600
You know, when I first
met you I was scared of you.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.300
Really?

12:36.400 --> 12:39.000
Yeah, but I'm scared
of everybody.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.400
It's always
my first reaction.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.600
Well, you're not scared
of me now, are you?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.600
No.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.900
You want to shoot?

12:54.935 --> 12:56.800
Huh?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.200
Make it interesting,
say a buck a game.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.100
Mmm?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.900
No, it's the round thing
in the middle there.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.750
How you feelin'?
Everything all right in here now?

13:22.785 --> 13:25.100
- Your stomach all right?
- I know what you're doin'.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.100
Don't distract me.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.000
Oh.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.365
- Ho!
- Hmm.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.100
I've been hustled.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.400
- Did I get your toe?
- No. No, no, no.

13:44.435 --> 13:46.300
I'm so sorry.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.400
Come on, get up.
Come on.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.750
Aw, shit.

14:10.785 --> 14:12.400
All right.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.600
Wait.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.600
Yeah, go on.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.200
- Tony here?
- Yeah, come on in.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.800
Hey.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.365
Let me know
if you guys need anything.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.800
What, are you gonna tell me
about the traffic again?

14:35.835 --> 14:38.000
Here, our friend
sent this for you.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.800
Thank you for taking
the appointment.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.700
And I know
I'm on probation,

15:45.735 --> 15:48.500
and I deeply regret...

15:48.535 --> 15:50.800
what I did.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.500
My nephew's fiancee.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.100
I know what
you're thinking.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.865
So?

16:14.900 --> 16:16.800
Well, nothing happened,

16:16.900 --> 16:18.800
but it could've
very easily.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.300
I mean,
she really got to me,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.500
this young lady.
She, uh...

16:25.600 --> 16:27.465
What?

16:27.500 --> 16:30.100
This is
a very big step.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.965
Yeah, tell me
about it.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.600
I mean, that you've come here
to talk about this impulse

16:34.700 --> 16:37.100
instead of just acting
on it without thinking.

16:37.135 --> 16:38.800
No, I always think.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.200
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.965
Having sex with
your mistress' cousin,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.500
like the mistress wasn't enough
to piss off your wife.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.700
Tell me
about the niece.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.700
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.250
Someone like her
I could...

17:02.285 --> 17:04.742
I could do it
right this time,

17:04.777 --> 17:07.200
I could start
a whole new family.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.099
I'm young enough.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.300
Fuck 'em all.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.599
And this is something
you're contemplating?

17:18.635 --> 17:21.800
What? It would be
a disaster

17:21.835 --> 17:23.500
of major proportions.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.565
Carmela... I'd get
hosed financially.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.900
There would be no reasoning
with her after that.

17:27.935 --> 17:31.265
And my nephew,
it would kill him...

17:31.300 --> 17:34.100
after years of grooming him
to be my number two.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.700
And it would be very bad
for the girl.

17:39.735 --> 17:41.300
She doesn't
deserve that.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.200
I mean, I'm not stupid.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.500
I know part of it's this
father-figure thing...

17:45.600 --> 17:47.700
you know, on account
of hers ran off.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.200
It would be like committing
an act of symbolic incest.

17:53.235 --> 17:55.000
Whatever.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.350
Look, what am I
gonna do?

17:58.385 --> 18:00.300
I got lucky
the first time,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.300
'cause I was able
to control myself,

18:02.400 --> 18:05.300
- but you only get one of those.
- Rationalizing.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.900
"I can't control myself. "
You can.

18:08.935 --> 18:10.865
I don't know.

18:10.900 --> 18:14.000
It's different for women.
It's all about up here with them.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.900
She could make
a play for you.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.700
You might want
to think about

18:17.800 --> 18:21.700
how you're going to establish
limits and boundaries.

18:21.735 --> 18:23.165
For example,

18:23.200 --> 18:26.100
you could tell her she
means a great deal to you,

18:26.200 --> 18:28.000
but you think of her
as a daughter.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.500
Even if I want to
fuck her brains out.

18:30.535 --> 18:33.665
This is a milestone
for you.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.400
You're at a very
important crossroads.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.265
For once you want to avoid

18:39.300 --> 18:41.965
doing something
you know is wrong

18:42.000 --> 18:44.800
and would be destructive
both to yourself

18:44.835 --> 18:47.400
and to the people
you care about.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.550
That's growth.

18:49.585 --> 18:51.565
That's progress.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.750
Just tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

18:53.785 --> 18:55.900
You have to be
honest with yourself.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.900
I know this is
a powerful urge,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.400
but if you can't
keep it in your pants,

19:00.435 --> 19:02.500
you have to
stay away from her.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.300
You know...

19:14.500 --> 19:16.900
not long ago,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.065
you stood
in my outer office.

19:20.100 --> 19:24.800
I recall you used the words
"drop-dead gorgeous" about me

19:24.835 --> 19:27.200
and how you
had to have me.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.300
I said I wouldn't date you,
and look, you survived.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
What a horrible
fucking job you have.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.100
How do you do it?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.600
But what happens
now is your choice.

19:39.635 --> 19:43.265
Act and create
a bed of misery,

19:43.300 --> 19:47.200
or you can look at this
as a chance to do something good.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You say
she respects you.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.300
Be worthy of respect.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.800
See if you can remain
a friend to this woman,

19:59.600 --> 20:01.900
a help to her.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.600
You know,
Tony had ducks one time...

20:10.700 --> 20:12.700
in his pool.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.400
You need to find out
where Chris went.

20:16.435 --> 20:18.800
I'm getting
this vibe from him.

20:18.835 --> 20:21.465
Who? Tony?

20:21.500 --> 20:24.300
He's really nice.
He listens.

20:24.335 --> 20:27.100
He's kind of attractive...

20:27.200 --> 20:29.100
definitely an alpha male...

20:29.200 --> 20:32.300
but what if Christopher
found out?

20:32.335 --> 20:35.200
What?
I'm not gonna fuck him.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.000
Then, what are you
talking about?

20:37.100 --> 20:40.300
I love Christopher, and sooner
or later we're gonna get out

20:40.400 --> 20:44.100
from under all this shit
and leave this fucking state.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.800
Jesus Christ.
She's a good-looking woman,

20:46.835 --> 20:48.800
and she wants
to fuck Barney Rubble?

20:48.900 --> 20:52.500
"Well, we really don't know him.
He listens. "

20:54.700 --> 20:58.000
Excuse me,
is this seat taken?

21:06.700 --> 21:10.165
- Tony, hi.
- Hey. How you doing?

21:10.200 --> 21:13.100
Well, why I'm here,
Patsy's bringing somebody by,

21:13.135 --> 21:16.000
- I'm gonna need to use the office.
- No problem.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.665
I made a resolution.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.200
I got to start spending
a lot more time on the floor.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.100
Crack the whip.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.400
I'm beat,
tell you the truth.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.400
I think I'm gonna grab
40 winks till Patsy gets here.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.550
Wait, you don't have
Chrissy's cell, do you?

21:35.585 --> 21:38.200
He called but he didn't
leave a new number.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.800
He'll probably
try you again.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.700
He's due back tomorrow.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.400
Oh, excuse me.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.500
- I'll come back.
- No, I'm all right.

22:11.300 --> 22:14.500
This mole back there looked
irregular around the margins.

22:14.535 --> 22:17.700
Every time I see anything now,
I think I got melanoma.

22:17.735 --> 22:19.700
I can imagine.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.200
Hi, it's Adriana
at The Crazy Horse.

22:26.235 --> 22:28.300
Yeah, I need
a car, please.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.100
Just tell him
to wait outside.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.465
What, your car still?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.700
Yeah, they're replacing
the alternator.

22:36.735 --> 22:38.365
You want a belt?

22:38.400 --> 22:41.800
What I could
really use is some...

22:43.500 --> 22:45.765
I wouldn't say no.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.500
Get me motivated
to clean the house

22:47.600 --> 22:50.800
before Christopher gets back,
except I'm all out.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.100
It's 2:00, Cross-Eyed Billy probably
left the Bing already.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.000
I know a guy, Andre,
he's always up.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.000
Well, cancel the car,
I'll give you a ride.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.200
You know who thinks
you're cute...

23:14.700 --> 23:16.265
is Marlene.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.500
She's got to be over 30,
isn't she?

23:18.600 --> 23:21.265
She's 31.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.200
You know who you
ought to introduce me to

23:23.300 --> 23:25.200
is that friend a yours.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.965
Who?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.400
The one you brought over
to the house that time.

23:29.435 --> 23:32.667
Tall, kind of blondish,
brownish hair...

23:32.702 --> 23:35.900
- Danielle from Whippany.
- She's dead.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.300
What?

23:37.400 --> 23:41.100
Yeah, she drowned
on a picnic.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.965
Oh.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
You know, I thought I picked up on
something between her and me.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.100
I'm not trying
to be conceited.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.500
Tony!

24:26.600 --> 24:28.565
I've reviewed your chart

24:28.600 --> 24:31.300
and ruled out internal injuries,
so you're free to go.

24:31.335 --> 24:34.000
I'll have the nurse
process your discharge orders.

24:34.100 --> 24:37.200
Whoa, whoa.
This was a very bad accident.

24:37.235 --> 24:40.500
Are you sure you
did all the tests?

24:40.535 --> 24:42.665
I can afford it.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.665
I did the appropriate tests.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.700
I have a medical degree
from Johns Hopkins.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.200
My grandmother was
the first black woman licensed

24:49.235 --> 24:51.100
to practice medicine
in Delaware.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.465
All right, take it easy.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.765
The young lady
that I was with,

24:54.800 --> 24:58.200
they said she was okay,
but could I see her?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.300
Ade.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.100
They say you're
gonna be fine,

25:15.200 --> 25:17.700
they just want to keep
you here for observation.

25:17.735 --> 25:19.700
You know,
be on the safe side.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.800
I don't even remember
what happened.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.900
There was a raccoon
in the road,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.200
I swerved.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.400
- How's your car?
- Escalade?

25:36.500 --> 25:38.565
It's totaled.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.300
Probably saved our life.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.300
Are you okay?

25:46.400 --> 25:49.500
Yeah, they're gonna
let me go.

25:49.535 --> 25:52.100
I want to go too.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.800
Chrissy's coming
home today.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.500
We should probably
talk about that.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.950
Oh.

26:04.985 --> 26:06.700
Yeah.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.500
Right.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.500
Dude, how you doing?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.500
I hit the fucking
mother-lode.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.900
20 Gs of product a week.
Little Paulie's behind me

26:30.000 --> 26:32.065
- with the other half.
- Fuck me.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.700
Now, 20% of this load, they can stamp
the packs for the vending machines.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.500
The rest, the cartons can
go straight to the bodegas,

26:39.600 --> 26:42.000
let them worry
about the stamps.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.765
I'm beat.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.400
I'm gonna hit
the fucking rack,

26:45.500 --> 26:47.700
have Ade cook me up
a nice carbonara.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.465
What's the matter?

26:51.500 --> 26:54.200
Don't know how to tell you,
but Adriana's in the hospital.

26:54.235 --> 26:57.500
- She was in an accident.
- What? When?

26:57.535 --> 26:59.665
Last night
around 2:00.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.300
Jesus Christ, what happened?
Is she all right?

27:02.400 --> 27:04.600
She got banged up,
but she's gonna be okay.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.200
The drinking and driving...
I told her!

27:07.300 --> 27:09.700
- Where is she?
- Mount Mercy in Dover.

27:09.735 --> 27:12.167
- Dover?
- Apparently they swerved

27:12.202 --> 27:14.600
- to avoid a deer in the road.
- They?

27:14.635 --> 27:18.517
- Her and Tony.
- Tony? Soprano?

27:18.552 --> 27:22.365
- Uh-huh.
- Is he all right?

27:22.400 --> 27:25.800
Not a scratch.
The fucking luck on this guy.

27:25.835 --> 27:27.500
Yeah.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.800
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, Dover.

27:29.900 --> 27:33.300
Right, she's got an aunt she's close
to out there who's been sick.

27:33.335 --> 27:35.800
She's friends
with Tony's aunt.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.000
All right, somebody
take me to get my car.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.700
I better
get over there.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.700
Fabio, put it up!

27:50.500 --> 27:53.200
Thought I'd die in there
without a cigarette.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.650
What, so you're
just not gonna talk?

27:59.685 --> 28:02.100
I almost got killed,
Christopher.

28:02.135 --> 28:04.065
I'm just curious.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.700
What the fuck were you doing
in the middle of the night

28:06.800 --> 28:10.100
in the middle of nowhere
in a car with my uncle?

28:10.135 --> 28:12.700
He was driving me home.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.065
- Fucking Dover?
- We were talking.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.565
W- we were going
to get something to eat.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.600
I get off of work,
I don't want to go right home.

28:20.635 --> 28:22.265
You weren't
even there.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.400
No, I was
in a fucking Ride-A-Rent

28:24.500 --> 28:27.100
busting my ass with a bunch
of rednecks making a living,

28:27.135 --> 28:29.265
to buy you
alcohol and coke

28:29.300 --> 28:32.100
and all the other shit
you shovel into your mouth!

28:34.600 --> 28:36.765
2:00 in the fucking morning?!

28:36.800 --> 28:39.800
Don't fucking lie to me!
I can't stand it!

28:39.835 --> 28:41.865
Nothing was going on,
Christopher!

28:41.900 --> 28:45.500
- I should've made you walk home!
- I swear to God.

28:45.535 --> 28:48.500
You know how this looks?
Don't talk to me!

28:48.535 --> 28:50.500
Shut your mouth!

29:06.400 --> 29:08.365
You wanted
to see me?

29:08.400 --> 29:11.365
- Is Adriana okay?
- She's fine.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.500
People who don't clean up
after their pets...

29:16.700 --> 29:20.200
Pop this in that basket
for me, will you?

29:30.700 --> 29:32.465
It's blind luck,
that accident.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.700
Cop told me he thought
he was coming up

29:34.735 --> 29:37.100
on a fatality
when he saw the car.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.100
I would be thinking
the same thing if I were you,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.665
but it's not true.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.000
Her car was
in the shop,

29:48.100 --> 29:49.800
I was driving her
home from work,

29:49.835 --> 29:51.365
that's all.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.000
We were looking
to get a burger.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.300
In Dover.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.865
What difference
does it make?

29:55.900 --> 29:58.550
You don't seem to give
a shit she almost died.

29:58.585 --> 30:01.200
She could've been paralyzed
or scarred up,

30:01.235 --> 30:03.700
and you got a puss on?

30:03.800 --> 30:07.600
What were you doing out there
alone in a car with my fiancee?

30:07.700 --> 30:10.065
We were talking about you,
you selfish prick,

30:10.100 --> 30:13.400
and how you're the best thing
that ever happened to her.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.700
Oh, you don't think this
fucking devastates me?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.000
Well, frankly, you scored
so far over your head

30:18.035 --> 30:19.867
when you got her,
what do you expect?

30:19.902 --> 30:21.700
What the fuck are you
talking about?

30:21.735 --> 30:23.400
She's a knockout,

30:23.500 --> 30:26.150
a 10,
and look at you.

30:26.185 --> 30:28.765
You're average at best,

30:28.800 --> 30:31.100
so you better reconcile
yourself with that,

30:31.200 --> 30:33.600
or you're gonna be fucking
paranoid your whole life.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.600
Oh, so this is
my fucking fault now?

30:35.700 --> 30:38.450
Nothing happened,
and I'm not gonna say it again!

30:38.485 --> 30:41.200
And you should've married
that girl two years ago.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.500
Everybody knows you've been
the biggest fucking cooze hound

30:44.535 --> 30:46.300
around the past
four or five years.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
Your mid-life crisis.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
You'd fuck
a catcher's mitt.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.000
On everything
I hold sacred,

30:57.035 --> 30:58.865
on my children,

30:58.900 --> 31:02.400
there's nothing going on
between me and Adriana.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.865
Tony walked away
without a scratch,

31:16.900 --> 31:20.600
but Adriana suffered
a severe blow to the head.

31:20.635 --> 31:24.300
Adriana got caught giving
the big guy a blowjob.

31:24.335 --> 31:26.000
And when the paramedics
found them,

31:26.100 --> 31:28.765
she had his cock
still in her mouth.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.065
Now, statistics show that
most single-car fatalities

31:32.100 --> 31:36.100
are the result of guys popping
their load behind the wheel.

31:36.135 --> 31:39.100
Apparently, he came
all over the sun visor.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.800
Sanseverino.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.800
Guess who went down
on Tony Soprano.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.765
That's the truth.
It's fact.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.400
If it was my old lady,
the next thing she would suck

31:51.500 --> 31:53.400
- is a tailpipe.
- That pretty little trim

31:53.500 --> 31:55.300
can suck this pipe
anytime she wants.

31:55.335 --> 31:57.100
Like you would
ever have a shot.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.000
Hey, let me
tell you something.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.850
When Christopher was
in rehab,

32:00.885 --> 32:02.565
she was calling me
all the time.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.000
- I was this close.
- Then you got a problem,

32:05.100 --> 32:07.200
'cause your braciole
isn't even that long.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.300
What's so funny?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.000
Nothing.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.100
Didn't sound like nothing,
I want to hear the big joke.

32:19.135 --> 32:21.467
Take it easy,
we're just shooting the shit.

32:21.502 --> 32:23.800
We were just talking
about my braciole.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.800
- Oh yeah, what about it?
- So, deal you in, huh?

32:26.900 --> 32:29.400
I asked him
a fucking question.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.165
What are you breaking
my balls for?

32:32.200 --> 32:34.900
I want a fucking answer.
What's so fucking hilarious,

32:34.935 --> 32:37.100
- you fucking parade float?
- Oh!

32:37.135 --> 32:39.100
I'm a fucking
captain now.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.900
You don't talk
to me like that!

32:41.000 --> 32:43.450
- Oh, come on, guys.
- Don't put your hands on me!

32:43.485 --> 32:45.900
- Chrissy, for Christ's sake!
- Fuck all of youse!

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
- Oh! Whoa, whoa!
- Motherfucker!

32:48.100 --> 32:50.200
- Hold it.
- Easy.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.600
Vinar, Jimmy,
please join me.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.200
So talk to me, guys,
how do we look in these?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.965
Hey, hon.
I already ate.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.100
- There's a casserole in...
- You fucking lying bitch!

33:06.200 --> 33:08.700
Ow! Stop it!
What are you doing?!

33:08.800 --> 33:11.300
You were sucking his cock!
Georgie told me everything!

33:11.400 --> 33:13.300
The surgeon
on the operating table

33:13.335 --> 33:15.200
said you were
moaning Tony's name!

33:15.300 --> 33:17.800
- What are you talking about?!
- You fucking lied to me!

33:17.900 --> 33:19.600
What were you doing
in Dover then?

33:19.635 --> 33:21.965
See?
You can't tell me,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.200
'cause I know what you were doing!
Your other dope dealer's there.

33:25.235 --> 33:27.367
I remembered,
go ahead, deny it!

33:27.402 --> 33:29.500
Okay! I was going out
to see Andre,

33:29.600 --> 33:33.100
but I wasn't sucking anybody's cock!
How could you say that?

33:33.135 --> 33:35.217
Oh, so you two
were just gonna go toot up

33:35.252 --> 33:37.265
a bunch of lines,
go fucking birdwatching?

33:37.300 --> 33:40.000
Oh, you son of a bitch.
I was gonna stay up all night

33:40.100 --> 33:41.965
and clean this
fucking shithole!

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Everybody knows about it!
Everybody's talking about it!

33:46.600 --> 33:49.065
- No, please!
- You want me to use you, bitch!

33:49.100 --> 33:53.000
- You're fucking killing me!
- No, I don't, I love you!

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
Stop it.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.300
- You motherfucker!
- Fucking whore.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.765
Ow, my neck!

34:04.800 --> 34:07.200
Get the fuck out of here!

34:07.300 --> 34:09.900
I never want
to see you again!

34:43.100 --> 34:45.800
I thought you had
an algebra test.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.500
- Oh, chill out.
- What did you say?

34:49.800 --> 34:52.400
Well, look, I studied
for 45 minutes straight,

34:52.435 --> 34:55.900
don't I get a break?

34:56.000 --> 34:59.100
Hi. What's up?

34:59.200 --> 35:02.200
Oh, AJ,
how's it going?

35:02.235 --> 35:04.065
Hey, Uncle Tony.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.150
Did I come
at a bad time?

35:06.185 --> 35:08.200
I need
to talk to you.

35:09.700 --> 35:12.900
AJ, go upstairs, study.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.800
- Well, what about the pizza?
- Now!

35:20.300 --> 35:22.100
Study.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.965
All right,
what's up?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.500
I went to the Belleville Tavern
after work,

35:35.600 --> 35:37.400
and Larry
down there said

35:37.500 --> 35:39.700
our little cousin was
in there all fucked up.

35:39.735 --> 35:41.900
Somebody told him what
was going on in the car.

35:41.935 --> 35:43.765
There was nothing
going on in the car.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.765
No, of course not,
but he thinks there was,

35:45.800 --> 35:48.100
so he started drinking again,
he beat up Adriana

35:48.135 --> 35:50.100
and he threw her out
of the fucking house.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.665
Where's his fucking
self-control, this guy?

35:52.700 --> 35:55.900
Little Paulie's out there
looking for him to rein him in,

35:55.935 --> 35:58.000
but he was saying some
crazy things about you.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.400
Oh, this goddamn kid.

36:01.500 --> 36:05.100
Christopher's not
right in the head, Ton'.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.300
Who the fuck knows
what he's capable of?

36:07.400 --> 36:08.900
Well, he knows
where to find me.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.200
You see him
you tell him that.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.900
I got to use your john.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.700
Get you
a day early, huh?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.250
I'll go to the store
in the morning.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.700
Look, relax.
Go whenever you want.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.665
What the hell
is wrong with him?

36:39.700 --> 36:42.900
What do you want, Tony?
He couldn't bring this in himself?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.365
I can't even come in
and say hello?

36:45.400 --> 36:48.900
What you want is to know if I heard
the disgusting shit they're saying.

36:48.935 --> 36:50.900
At least have the guts
to come out and ask me.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.565
- It isn't true.
- You know what? Fuck you!

36:53.600 --> 36:56.400
Fuck me? Fuck you!
- You got to put your son in hiding

36:56.500 --> 36:58.565
because of your
fucking philandering?

36:58.600 --> 37:01.400
Afraid he'll get caught
in the crossfire? Your own son?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.065
Christopher's upset,
that's all.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.200
He could come over.
He could say some things

37:05.300 --> 37:08.800
- that a kid shouldn't hear.
- Just please leave.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.300
I don't even
want to look at you.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
Motherfucker!

38:11.800 --> 38:13.500
Motherfucking gun!

38:17.700 --> 38:19.565
Give me two.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.500
This kid ain't
gonna show up, T.

38:21.535 --> 38:23.400
He's probably
in some gutter.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.700
Yeah, hopefully
he's wore himself down.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.600
Where are you,
you fuck!

38:27.700 --> 38:29.400
He's got a gun!

38:29.500 --> 38:32.200
I know you're
up there, motherfucker!

38:32.235 --> 38:34.365
You know what
to do down there!

38:34.400 --> 38:38.100
You're fucking lucky!
You're fucking lucky I ran out of loads!

38:38.200 --> 38:40.065
Shut up,
you little cock,

38:40.100 --> 38:43.500
- or I'll split your fucking wishbone.
- It's all over.

38:43.535 --> 38:45.600
Everybody,
enjoy the evening.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.700
Unhappy customer.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.600
Let me the fuck go!

39:16.700 --> 39:18.465
I'll kill all of youse!

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
I'll fucking kill
all of youse!

39:26.200 --> 39:28.500
You draw down on the boss
of a fucking family?

39:28.535 --> 39:31.265
- Huh?!
- You lied to me!

39:31.300 --> 39:33.965
You were scoring coke with her!
She admitted it!

39:34.000 --> 39:37.700
So what?! I can't relieve stress
every once in a while?!

39:37.735 --> 39:39.800
I don't got enough
fucking problems?

39:39.835 --> 39:41.817
You sent me
to North Carolina

39:41.852 --> 39:43.765
so you could fuck
my girlfriend.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.800
What kind of fucking animal
you think I am, huh?

39:47.835 --> 39:50.100
The thought never
even entered my head!

39:50.200 --> 39:52.700
You're a man!
You're alone in a car with her...

39:52.800 --> 39:55.600
You fucking pushed me to this.
You pushed me to this!

40:02.800 --> 40:05.300
Way I see it, he must've known
the gun was empty.

40:05.335 --> 40:07.417
Look what he pumped
into your car.

40:07.452 --> 40:09.976
What are you trying
to say, Paulie?!

40:10.011 --> 40:12.500
What the fuck
you trying to say, huh?!

40:20.300 --> 40:22.265
Either you
tell me right now

40:22.300 --> 40:24.300
that you can take it
into your heart

40:24.400 --> 40:26.500
that I did not
do this shit...

40:28.200 --> 40:30.600
or this is
as far as we go.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.965
- Motherfucker.
- Tony, come on!

40:42.000 --> 40:44.900
- Listen to somebody else for a change.
- Fuck him.

40:44.935 --> 40:47.700
Tony, try it my way.

40:47.735 --> 40:50.300
Listen to me.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.765
Mister... Sorriano,

41:16.800 --> 41:18.900
- what seems to be the matter?
- Soprano.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.600
I'm fine. It's my friend here
who needs to talk to you.

41:21.635 --> 41:23.165
You know where
ER admitting is?

41:23.200 --> 41:26.165
Look, you got someplace
maybe we could talk?

41:26.200 --> 41:29.900
It's 3:00 A.M., and I just finished
a 17-hour rotation.

41:29.935 --> 41:33.500
Any gunshot wounds
or broken kneecaps?

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
Two minutes.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.800
You're an excellent doctor,
that's why I brought him here.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.600
Come on.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.700
This gentleman here
is the fiance

41:54.735 --> 41:57.117
of the young lady
that I was with.

41:57.152 --> 41:59.465
Now, he's got it
into his head

41:59.500 --> 42:02.400
that there was oral sex going on
at the time of the wreck.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
- Listen, I...
- Hey, hey, hey!

42:06.400 --> 42:09.000
Just a second.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.965
Naturally,
he's very upset,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.500
so I need you
to tell him there wasn't.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.500
He's obviously
feeling the pressure,

42:16.600 --> 42:18.500
he's just gonna
fucking lie.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.300
I'm not in the custom
of lying about anything,

42:22.400 --> 42:25.765
but whether somebody

42:25.800 --> 42:28.050
was getting
something in the car,

42:28.085 --> 42:30.265
how could I possibly
attest to that?

42:30.300 --> 42:32.265
Well, as the attending,
you could explain

42:32.300 --> 42:34.500
- how medically it's not possible.
- Excuse me?

42:34.600 --> 42:37.900
If she was wearing her seatbelt,
then there would have been abrasions

42:37.935 --> 42:40.900
to the lateral anterior aspect
of the clavicle, wouldn't there?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Or the right
mid-sternum?

42:43.100 --> 42:45.065
Are you a physician?

42:45.100 --> 42:49.100
No, I'm a pre-board certified
massage therapist.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.200
So did she have any
of those kind of things?

42:53.235 --> 42:55.265
Actually, yes,
on the right clavicle

42:55.300 --> 42:58.300
and the sternum just above
the xiphoid process

42:58.335 --> 43:00.465
which would indicate

43:00.500 --> 43:02.600
an upright position
at the moment of impact.

43:02.700 --> 43:05.300
So what he's saying is
that she was sitting up.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.565
All right.

43:09.600 --> 43:12.100
Thank you, doctor.
Come on.

43:13.900 --> 43:16.300
For the kids,
the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

43:16.400 --> 43:18.200
whatever... here.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.500
Thank you!

43:25.100 --> 43:27.300
What do you
want from me?

43:27.335 --> 43:29.500
I guess
I believe you.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.700
All right.

43:36.100 --> 43:38.900
You threw food at Vito.
That's got to be resolved.

43:38.935 --> 43:41.000
He was fucking laughing,
which was wrong.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.800
But at this point now,
it don't make no difference.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.900
Even if it wasn't true,
it's what people think.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.700
They know you were out there
scoring coke with her.

43:58.735 --> 44:00.700
What do you care
what people think?

44:00.800 --> 44:02.565
You know the truth.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.600
I got to live
in the world.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.000
And now I look
like Joe Jerkoff.

44:13.700 --> 44:15.400
No, no, no, no.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.000
You know what?

44:26.100 --> 44:28.500
I might as well
have fucked her.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.200
Thanks.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.300
Hello?

44:42.700 --> 44:44.665
I rang the doorbell
six times.

44:44.700 --> 44:47.100
- Nobody answered.
- What are you doing here?

44:47.200 --> 44:49.100
I want to talk to you.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.065
If you came to pick
him up, he's not going.

44:51.100 --> 44:53.600
Oh, so you believe all that
shit they're saying, huh?

44:53.635 --> 44:56.700
Am I that horrible?
Really?

44:56.800 --> 44:58.500
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

44:58.535 --> 45:00.100
I don't know
what you did.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.800
What's gonna happen when
your children hear about this?

45:02.835 --> 45:05.100
- Meadow already suspects you.
- Suspects what?

45:05.200 --> 45:08.200
She saw you at the club.
She said she thought you were coked out.

45:08.235 --> 45:10.300
What are you talking about?
I don't do drugs.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.400
She knows about the accident.
What do you think she's gonna think?

45:13.500 --> 45:14.965
And with Anthony
at that age?

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Oh, come on, the kids!
The kids... It's about you!

45:18.035 --> 45:19.565
Fine, so it's
all about me!

45:19.600 --> 45:21.100
What, do I mean
nothing to you?!

45:21.200 --> 45:23.900
That I got to live with this
swirling around me?

45:25.800 --> 45:28.200
Forget about what they're saying,
I'm asking you.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.800
You think I'd have
sexual relations with her?

45:30.835 --> 45:33.300
Adriana, who's gonna be
a member of this family?!

45:36.100 --> 45:39.165
Now I want you
to answer me truthfully.

45:39.200 --> 45:43.200
Look, I know I haven't
been a fucking saint, all right?

45:43.235 --> 45:46.717
And you got plenty of issues
of your own on that subject.

45:46.752 --> 45:50.200
But you haven't exactly
been a fucking saint yourself.

45:55.300 --> 45:57.000
No, no, no, no, no,
come here.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.800
You think I would go near
that girl like that?

46:15.300 --> 46:16.400
Thank you.

46:21.700 --> 46:23.850
Look, I'm asking you
to pull with me

46:23.885 --> 46:25.965
to put a good face
on this thing.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.600
For the sake of the kids
and this family.

46:28.700 --> 46:31.400
I got to bail
you out?

46:31.500 --> 46:34.300
It's never-ending,
your bullshit.

46:52.900 --> 46:55.800
Use a fucking
crosswalk!

47:06.900 --> 47:09.200
Jesus Christ.

47:09.300 --> 47:11.700
Don't get
all excited.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.065
Most of it's
from the accident.

47:14.100 --> 47:18.000
- You okay?
- What do you fucking think?

47:19.000 --> 47:20.700
Kicked out
of my house,

47:20.800 --> 47:24.165
I may have ulcerated colitis
and you call me up.

47:24.200 --> 47:28.100
We'd like your permission to put
a listening device in your business.

47:28.135 --> 47:30.900
This relationship with Tony
could net us a lot of chatter.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.700
Don't forget,
it's him we're after.

47:32.800 --> 47:35.300
There is
no relationship!

47:35.400 --> 47:37.300
The faster we get Tony
and put him away,

47:37.400 --> 47:40.065
the sooner you can
get on with your life.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.500
We can get a court order
to install a device anyway,

47:42.600 --> 47:46.100
- but this will make our lives simpler.
- Fuck you.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.000
I do enough
for you people.

47:48.035 --> 47:49.800
You're not
bugging my club.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.465
Adriana...

47:51.500 --> 47:55.900
it's a syndrome,
protecting abusers.

47:57.600 --> 48:00.600
If it would've been Christopher
alone in a car with a woman,

48:00.635 --> 48:03.100
I would've killed him.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.700
Arthur's sending something
over with his compliments.

48:38.735 --> 48:40.600
Thank you.

48:46.900 --> 48:48.600
Thank you.

48:50.300 --> 48:52.000
Enjoy.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
- Nice to see you, Ton'.
- Oh, thank you.

49:12.300 --> 49:14.600
- Gravy's good tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.265
Nice to see you.

49:26.300 --> 49:28.300
I hope you have
a pleasant evening.

49:37.300 --> 49:39.000
Ladies.
