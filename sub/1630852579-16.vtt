The building blocks of life
traveling on a meteorite.

00:09.542 --> 00:12.542
You're looking at a speck
of water in a meteorite.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.333
This is extraordinary.

00:14.458 --> 00:18.792
NARRATOR:
An otherworldly presence
found in our atmosphere.

00:18.875 --> 00:22.125
MILTON WAINWRIGHT:
So, this is a titanium sphere
with life inside

00:22.208 --> 00:23.750
and life on the outside.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.125
Now, what on earth is it?

00:25.208 --> 00:27.833
Absolutely amazing.
It's blowing my head off.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.333
NARRATOR:
For more than a decade,

00:29.458 --> 00:32.333
<i>Ancient Aliens</i> has
followed investigators

00:32.417 --> 00:34.750
across the globe
as they've gone directly

00:34.875 --> 00:39.042
to the sites where signs
of alien life have been found.

00:39.167 --> 00:41.917
Now we take a look back

00:42.042 --> 00:44.583
at some of the most
incredible evidence we've seen.

00:44.708 --> 00:48.250
Evidence that, according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

00:48.375 --> 00:50.417
provides undeniable proof

00:50.542 --> 00:54.125
that we are not alone
in the universe.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.542
♪ ♪

01:10.542 --> 01:13.583
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have traveled the globe

01:13.708 --> 01:15.125
investigating everything

01:15.250 --> 01:17.625
from tiny microbes

01:17.708 --> 01:21.208
to massive megaliths,
all in the quest to find proof

01:21.333 --> 01:23.500
of extraterrestrial life.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.125
And one of the most
incredible places

01:26.208 --> 01:28.625
we've ever visited
is a field study site

01:28.750 --> 01:31.083
for an organization called SETI,

01:31.208 --> 01:35.042
or the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:35.167 --> 01:38.500
In 2016,
I got the rare opportunity

01:38.667 --> 01:42.208
to tour the grounds
and learn about how they listen

01:42.375 --> 01:46.500
for signs of intelligent life
in the universe.

01:46.583 --> 01:52.667
NARRATOR: Shasta County,
Northern California, March 2016.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.667
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

01:55.833 --> 01:59.333
travels to the Allen
Telescope Array in Hat Creek

01:59.458 --> 02:03.500
to meet with the director
for SETI research Seth Shostak.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.083
This is truly amazing.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.125
What can you tell me
about this place?

02:07.208 --> 02:09.292
Well, this place
is, uh, an observatory,

02:09.417 --> 02:12.125
but it's a radio observatory,
so these things around us,

02:12.208 --> 02:14.958
these 42 antennas,
they pick up radio waves.

02:15.042 --> 02:16.083
And we're trying to pick up

02:16.208 --> 02:17.833
very special sort
of radio waves,

02:17.917 --> 02:20.500
namely, some that would
tell us somebody's out there.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.292
By having lots
of these dishes here,

02:22.417 --> 02:24.458
we can look at
more of the sky at once.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.625
We can look at
multiple star systems at once.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.333
Why radio waves?

02:29.417 --> 02:32.333
What's so significant
about radio waves?

02:32.458 --> 02:34.333
SHOSTAK:
Radio waves go
at the speed of light,

02:34.458 --> 02:36.875
and they also, by the way,
go through all the gas and dust

02:37.000 --> 02:38.542
that's between the stars.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.542
So, you know,
if you want to communicate

02:40.667 --> 02:43.125
from one part of the galaxy
to another,

02:43.208 --> 02:46.125
radio waves
are a great way to do it.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.542
So the way this works
is actually kind of simple.

02:48.708 --> 02:51.792
I mean, the cosmic radio static,
it comes in from the sky

02:51.875 --> 02:54.000
and it bounces off
that big reflector there--

02:54.125 --> 02:55.417
that first one, okay?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.500
That's-that's a mirror
for radio waves.

02:57.625 --> 03:00.208
And that redirects
into this secondary reflector,

03:00.375 --> 03:02.167
on the end, on the nose there.

03:02.333 --> 03:06.083
And then they're directed to
the receiver, and that's inside.

03:06.208 --> 03:08.667
That information goes
through a fiber optic

03:08.750 --> 03:10.417
over to the control room.

03:10.542 --> 03:12.500
So, this is where the, uh, data

03:12.625 --> 03:15.042
coming through the fiber optics
kind of ends up

03:15.208 --> 03:17.333
after it's been processed
in a display like this.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.417
And what are we looking at
right here?

03:19.542 --> 03:20.958
So, we're looking, in this case,

03:21.083 --> 03:23.000
at three star systems
at once, okay?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.375
So that speeds up the search.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.375
It also allows us to determine

03:26.500 --> 03:28.458
whether we're really seeing E.T.
or just interference.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.625
The data from one
of these star systems

03:30.708 --> 03:33.000
is being displayed over
on this part of the screen here.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.000
This is called a waterfall plot.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.875
That. Can you see,
can you see that line

03:37.000 --> 03:38.667
-of brighter dots there?
-This right here, yes. Mm-hmm.

03:38.792 --> 03:41.500
SHOSTAK:
Yeah, that's a slightly
more static

03:41.625 --> 03:43.917
at that frequency,
slowly going down the dot.

03:44.042 --> 03:45.667
That's the kind of thing
we're looking for.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.042
So then, if this here
were an actual E.T. signal,

03:49.167 --> 03:50.750
how would
it differentiate itself?

03:50.875 --> 03:53.333
Uh, would it be a bit thicker,
a bit more pronounced,

03:53.417 --> 03:55.833
a bit longer, or...
What are you looking for?

03:55.958 --> 03:58.458
It could be all of those things.
So, what you do is,

03:58.542 --> 04:00.333
when you find a signal
like this, you make a test.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.167
You'll just move
the antennas a little bit

04:02.292 --> 04:04.042
and see if the signal goes away.

04:04.167 --> 04:06.625
And then, point it back at the
star and see if it comes back.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.375
You say, "Well,
that's looking promising."

04:08.542 --> 04:11.125
You do that again, go off,
go on, go off, go on.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.792
If you do that
five or ten times,

04:12.875 --> 04:14.167
you start to get excited.

04:14.292 --> 04:17.542
I hope that
that day will come very soon.

04:19.542 --> 04:21.250
NARRATOR:
Although the SETI Institute

04:21.375 --> 04:24.542
formally came
into existence in 1984,

04:24.708 --> 04:27.417
the practice of listening
for extraterrestrial life

04:27.542 --> 04:31.625
has been underway
since the 1960s.

04:31.708 --> 04:34.000
Astronomers based
at various universities

04:34.167 --> 04:35.708
throughout the U.S.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.750
have pointed their radio
telescopes into the cosmos

04:38.875 --> 04:42.583
in hopes of capturing signals
of intelligent life.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.667
And sometimes,
they receive a transmission

04:45.833 --> 04:47.375
they can't explain.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.708
Delaware, Ohio,

04:50.833 --> 04:55.583
August 15, 1977.

04:55.708 --> 04:58.917
At Ohio State University's
Big Ear radio telescope,

04:59.042 --> 05:04.208
astronomer Jerry R. Ehman
conducts research for SETI.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.167
While reviewing recorded data,

05:06.292 --> 05:08.667
he detects
a highly unusual signal

05:08.833 --> 05:13.083
originating from
the constellation Sagittarius.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.708
DAVID CHILDRESS:
They were looking

05:14.875 --> 05:18.542
for a 72-second signal

05:18.667 --> 05:21.500
that would be coming
from extraterrestrials.

05:21.625 --> 05:26.208
And as Dr. Jerry Ehman
monitored the output

05:26.333 --> 05:30.458
of the-the pages
that were coming from space,

05:30.542 --> 05:33.417
he suddenly found
a signal that matched

05:33.542 --> 05:35.333
exactly what they
were looking for.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.333
And so, he circled
the page of data

05:38.417 --> 05:42.333
that had that
72-second window on it

05:42.417 --> 05:45.292
and wrote "Wow!" next to it.

05:45.375 --> 05:48.667
And this became known
as the Wow! signal.

05:48.833 --> 05:53.542
And it essentially was the kind
of extraterrestrial SETI signal

05:53.708 --> 05:55.750
that they were all looking for,

05:55.875 --> 05:58.708
and had suddenly,
briefly, found it.

05:59.708 --> 06:01.500
NARRATOR:
While there are various theories

06:01.667 --> 06:05.000
as to what may have caused
the now-famous Wow! signal,

06:05.083 --> 06:08.500
from terrestrial radio
broadcasts to comet trails,

06:08.625 --> 06:12.042
SETI has not ruled out
the possibility

06:12.167 --> 06:15.500
that it may represent
modern man's first radio contact

06:15.583 --> 06:17.792
with extraterrestrials.

06:19.833 --> 06:22.208
SHOSTAK:
The Wow! signal
continues to intrigue people.

06:22.333 --> 06:26.000
So we are going to use
the Allen Telescope Array

06:26.167 --> 06:27.667
to reobserve the Wow! signal,

06:27.792 --> 06:29.458
look in the same spot
on the sky,

06:29.542 --> 06:31.333
look over a wider range
of frequencies.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.375
And-and if there's
something up there

06:33.542 --> 06:35.750
and it's still broadcasting,
of course we would find it.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.333
NARRATOR:
Might the discovery
of the Wow! signal

06:40.458 --> 06:42.500
bring us one step closer

06:42.625 --> 06:47.000
to discovering that we are
not alone in the universe?

06:47.167 --> 06:50.333
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining life-forms

06:50.458 --> 06:53.958
on Earth that are capable
of surviving

06:54.083 --> 06:57.458
inside a comet.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.583
The possibility of
finding evidence of alien life

07:05.708 --> 07:09.042
by receiving a message from
space is a thrilling prospect.

07:09.208 --> 07:12.833
But many scientists are looking
for clues right here on Earth.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.458
And in 2019,
I got the incredible opportunity

07:16.542 --> 07:18.625
to meet with a scientist
who believes

07:18.708 --> 07:21.500
he may have found
extraterrestrial life

07:21.625 --> 07:25.792
in one of the most inhospitable
environments on the planet.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.833
NARRATOR:
Whistler, Canada.

07:29.958 --> 07:33.500
April 17th, 2019.

07:33.625 --> 07:37.458
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

07:37.542 --> 07:40.750
and retired NASA scientist
Dr. Richard Hoover

07:40.875 --> 07:44.333
are about to board a helicopter
bound for a massive ice cave

07:44.417 --> 07:47.333
-in the Canadian wilderness.
-All right, you ready for this?

07:47.458 --> 07:50.083
-Yes, absolutely.
-All right.

07:50.208 --> 07:54.042
NARRATOR:
Dr. Hoover spent most of
his career studying fossils

07:54.208 --> 07:57.250
for signs of extraterrestrial
microscopic life

07:57.375 --> 07:59.583
and is a leading proponent
of panspermia,

07:59.708 --> 08:03.500
the idea that life on Earth
originally rained down

08:03.625 --> 08:05.625
from comets in outer space.

08:09.042 --> 08:11.292
He has invited Giorgio
to accompany him

08:11.417 --> 08:13.542
while he investigates
the Whistler ice cave...

08:13.708 --> 08:15.250
I always love this.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.000
NARRATOR:
...where he is confident
that they will find

08:17.125 --> 08:19.083
the glacial ice
teeming with microbial

08:19.208 --> 08:23.667
and perhaps even more
sophisticated life-forms.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.375
Life-forms that may be
thousands of years old.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.958
HOOVER:
Oh, this is just

08:29.083 --> 08:32.083
-absolutely magnificent.
-It really is.

08:32.208 --> 08:35.458
NARRATOR:
If alien microbes
are reaching Earth,

08:35.583 --> 08:37.750
Dr. Hoover suggests
that they could survive

08:37.875 --> 08:42.625
within such an environment
for long periods of time.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.667
Today, he'll examine the glacier
for the perfect samples

08:45.792 --> 08:48.125
to analyze in his laboratory.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.625
So, Richard,
how excited are you to be here

08:50.750 --> 08:52.667
to conduct this experiment?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.917
(chuckles):
Well, I'm tremendously excited.

08:55.042 --> 08:58.833
-This is, this is absolutely
a-a marvelous opportunity
-Yeah.

08:58.958 --> 09:01.583
to do more studies
of life in ice.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.000
NARRATOR:
After a 20-minute
helicopter ride,

09:04.125 --> 09:07.000
the team arrives
at the Whistler ice cave

09:07.083 --> 09:08.792
in the Pemberton glacier.

09:10.708 --> 09:13.292
TSOUKALOS:
Wow, this is incredible.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.917
HOOVER:
Yeah, amazing.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.917
Look at that.

09:19.042 --> 09:22.250
There must be a thousand
shades of blue in this ice cave.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.542
Just absolutely fantastic.

09:26.417 --> 09:30.000
And here we see all of these
magnificent shades of blue

09:30.167 --> 09:33.583
and up there,
you see big streaks of black.

09:33.708 --> 09:37.083
Glaciers like to eat rocks
and as they eat rocks,

09:37.208 --> 09:39.708
the rocks gather inside,

09:39.833 --> 09:42.667
and when the sun shines through
the ice and hits the rocks,

09:42.750 --> 09:46.792
it can cause it to melt and form
nice little pools of water.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.708
And then when bacteria
and algae grow in there

09:49.833 --> 09:51.625
and respire and produce

09:51.708 --> 09:53.958
their-their
photosynthetic products,

09:54.042 --> 09:55.500
they make their own atmosphere.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.917
So, around every
tiny rock in this glacier,

09:58.042 --> 10:02.042
there is a tiny planetary system
with its own biology,

10:02.167 --> 10:05.375
its own atmosphere,
its own soil, in effect.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.250
And its own oceans.

10:07.375 --> 10:11.167
NARRATOR:
The ice here is tens
of thousands of years old.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.500
But Dr. Hoover believes
it is teeming with life.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.583
Wow, I mean,
this is, uh, spectacular.

10:16.708 --> 10:19.875
So you just described,
basically, our environment

10:20.042 --> 10:21.917
-on a microscopic level.
-Exactly.

10:22.042 --> 10:25.292
HOOVER:
There is an enormous amount
of biology

10:25.375 --> 10:29.250
above us and throughout
this wonderful glacier.

10:33.708 --> 10:36.167
What we're about to do
is take a core sample

10:36.333 --> 10:37.875
of this beautiful blue ice.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.917
TSOUKALOS:
So, what are you
looking for, specifically,

10:41.042 --> 10:43.000
-right now?
-What I want to do first

10:43.125 --> 10:46.542
is chop away an outer layer
and get into the inner ice.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.500
We'll be looking
inside of the ice

10:48.625 --> 10:50.875
for the ice microorganisms.

10:52.125 --> 10:57.542
Now we know there can't
possibly be any contamination

10:57.708 --> 11:00.875
because this ice
has been in the glacier

11:01.000 --> 11:04.083
and now is only freshly exposed.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.625
And now we take the core.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.292
Now we're into the ice.

11:12.417 --> 11:16.292
I'll pull the ice core out.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.417
-So, okay...
-Mm-hmm. And that's
enough, right?

11:27.542 --> 11:30.333
-That's enough.
Yeah, that's first sample.
-Okay, great.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.167
-Yeah, c-cap that.
-Okay.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.583
All the microorganisms
that grow in ice

11:34.708 --> 11:36.875
typically grow
very, very slowly.

11:37.042 --> 11:39.917
So, in fact, there are
some microorganisms

11:40.042 --> 11:41.792
that only reproduce
once every half a century

11:41.875 --> 11:43.292
-or once a century.
-Mm-hmm.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.625
So, th-the microbes
that are found in here,

11:45.708 --> 11:47.417
are they in
suspended anim-animation

11:47.542 --> 11:49.000
or are they moving around?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.375
Probably both.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.042
So essentially,
what you're saying

11:52.167 --> 11:56.292
is that this entire cave
is filled with life.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.875
Yes. But not just that.

11:59.042 --> 12:02.000
This entire ice cap
is filled with life.

12:02.167 --> 12:06.083
There is this enormous amount
of microorganisms

12:06.208 --> 12:09.042
that live and thrive
and love to live

12:09.208 --> 12:12.208
in these low temperatures
of the, of the ice cave

12:12.333 --> 12:16.458
that we have here and ice caves
and icy, uh, glaciers

12:16.583 --> 12:17.750
all over the planet Earth.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.792
And probably
all over icy regions

12:20.875 --> 12:23.250
within our entire
solar system and mainly--

12:23.375 --> 12:26.333
maybe widely distributed
throughout the entire universe.

12:26.500 --> 12:31.792
Are we essentially inside
the interior of a, of a comet?

12:31.875 --> 12:34.167
-Is this what it looks like?
-Well, yes.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.958
HOOVER:
Microorganisms can live in ice,

12:37.083 --> 12:40.958
and ice is the dominant
component of comets.

12:41.042 --> 12:44.375
Organisms can
remain alive and protected

12:44.500 --> 12:47.708
by the icy material
of the comet until it arrives

12:47.875 --> 12:49.792
into another solar system

12:49.875 --> 12:52.042
and blows off
chunks of material

12:52.167 --> 12:56.375
that can find a planet that it
can consider a wonderful home.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.000
And so, this basically ties into
the whole idea of panspermia.

13:00.125 --> 13:03.417
Water is a wonderful
radiation shield,

13:03.542 --> 13:08.583
and when you have a comet
that is a few miles in diameter,

13:08.708 --> 13:11.208
on the inside
of that cometary crust,

13:11.375 --> 13:13.667
there is all of this
magnificent ice

13:13.792 --> 13:15.583
that has been frozen
and then reworked

13:15.708 --> 13:17.833
with material going in and out.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.292
So, comets are not just
a magnificent place

13:20.375 --> 13:23.583
for panspermia,
I am convinced that comets

13:23.708 --> 13:26.833
are absolutely a wonderful place
for the origin of life.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.042
NARRATOR:
As Giorgio and Dr. Hoover

13:31.208 --> 13:34.000
take their samples
to a lab to be analyzed,

13:34.083 --> 13:36.958
what kind of life-forms
might they find

13:37.083 --> 13:39.500
within the Pemberton glacier?

13:39.625 --> 13:42.333
Could it support the theory
that life on comets

13:42.500 --> 13:46.500
is more common
than we ever thought possible?

13:46.667 --> 13:49.333
First sample that we got.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.917
NARRATOR:
Now back in the lab,
they are hoping

13:52.042 --> 13:55.042
to observe microorganisms
that remained dormant

13:55.208 --> 13:58.250
within the glacial ice and are
just now returning to life

13:58.375 --> 14:01.333
for the first time
in thousands of years.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.167
-TSOUKALOS: Do you see anything?
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.625
HOOVER:
We've got bacteria.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.792
This is fantastic.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.875
I mean, look at this one--
it's spinning right here.

14:10.042 --> 14:12.875
-Yeah.
-This one just moves
straight across the screen.

14:13.042 --> 14:14.917
HOOVER:
And this one is tumbling.
And notice there's a cell

14:15.042 --> 14:17.000
that has just undergone
cell division.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.000
Here's another one that's
just undergone cell division.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.333
TSOUKALOS:
Okay.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.167
The quest
for extraterrestrial life,

14:24.292 --> 14:28.500
to me, has been a lifelong one,
as it has been with you.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.000
So I've traveled around
the world climbing pyramids,

14:31.083 --> 14:32.292
I've looked at statues,

14:32.417 --> 14:34.583
I've been to hundreds
of museums,

14:34.708 --> 14:36.708
I've read
countless ancient texts,

14:36.833 --> 14:39.500
and here we are
looking at something

14:39.625 --> 14:42.833
that shows extraterrestrial life

14:42.958 --> 14:45.875
that may have come here
millions of years ago.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.875
The fascinating thing is,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.583
that a far more
extraordinary hypothesis

14:51.708 --> 14:54.250
than the existence
of extraterrestrial life

14:54.375 --> 14:57.708
is the hypothesis that life
exists on the planet Earth

14:57.875 --> 14:59.500
and nowhere else
in the universe.

14:59.667 --> 15:03.167
If that were to turn out
to be what really is the case,

15:03.333 --> 15:06.333
then we would be
completely unique

15:06.458 --> 15:10.208
and we would be different from
everywhere else in the universe,

15:10.375 --> 15:13.208
and that would be
an amazing discovery.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.667
Much more amazing
than finding out that bacteria

15:16.792 --> 15:21.000
or ice worms are crawling around
on the surface of Europa today.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.958
This is incredibly fascinating.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.333
You know, and it's also
refreshing to hear

15:25.500 --> 15:29.208
an actual NASA scientist
telling me these things.

15:30.167 --> 15:32.667
NARRATOR:
If, as Dr. Hoover's
research indicates,

15:32.833 --> 15:37.125
icy comets are ideal incubators
for extraterrestrial life,

15:37.208 --> 15:38.917
and if microorganisms

15:39.042 --> 15:41.917
are incredibly common
in the universe,

15:42.042 --> 15:44.542
is the Earth being
regularly bombarded

15:44.667 --> 15:47.083
by tiny alien life-forms?

15:47.208 --> 15:50.125
Perhaps further clues
can be found

15:50.208 --> 15:52.667
by examining recent
scientific evidence

15:52.833 --> 15:55.292
that supports
the once-fringe theory

15:55.375 --> 15:59.167
that life on Earth was
seeded from outer space.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.000
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have found abundant evidence

16:06.125 --> 16:08.500
that alien life has
made its way to Earth.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.208
But what if these life-forms

16:10.333 --> 16:12.875
were deliberately sent
out into the universe

16:13.000 --> 16:16.458
and possibly even
directed right at our planet?

16:16.542 --> 16:21.083
In 2018, Andrew Collins
met with researchers who believe

16:21.208 --> 16:23.125
that they have found proof

16:23.250 --> 16:26.083
that Earth is being
regularly bombarded

16:26.208 --> 16:29.208
by microbial life-forms.

16:34.042 --> 16:37.042
NARRATOR: Author and researcher
Andrew Collins

16:37.208 --> 16:41.167
travels to Sheffield to witness
a remarkable demonstration.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.292
-Hi, guys, uh... Chris.
-Andrew, how are you?

16:44.417 --> 16:46.417
-About the same. Hi, Milton.
-Pleasure.
-NARRATOR: He is meeting

16:46.542 --> 16:48.625
with microbiologist
Milton Wainwright

16:48.708 --> 16:50.500
and engineer Chris Rose,

16:50.625 --> 16:54.125
two members of the research team
who are convinced

16:54.208 --> 16:57.417
that life on Earth may have
originated in space

16:57.542 --> 17:00.750
through a process
known as panspermia.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.000
I understand you've made
some incredible discoveries.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.417
Please tell me all about it.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.708
WAINWRIGHT:
In the early 2000s, my colleague

17:06.875 --> 17:08.333
Chandra Wickramasinghe,

17:08.458 --> 17:10.792
um, we were launching balloons
from India.

17:10.875 --> 17:14.750
And these were, uh, sampling
the air at 41 kilometers.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.875
And th-they showed
that organisms

17:17.042 --> 17:19.750
are continually
arriving all the time.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.625
Panspermia is
an extremely simple idea.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.667
Basically, it's the idea
that life came from space.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.917
Instead of being formed on
this planet, it came from space.

17:28.042 --> 17:30.333
My findings relate
to panspermia simply,

17:30.500 --> 17:33.083
and th-they show
that organisms are coming in

17:33.208 --> 17:35.083
at this very moment from space.

17:35.208 --> 17:38.375
Tell me how you actually
collect these samples.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.958
This is our-our balloon that's
gonna give us the buoyancy

17:41.042 --> 17:43.792
from the-the hydrogen gas here.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.375
Now, our capture mechanism
is right here.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.042
Let me show you this.
This exposes little, uh,

17:48.167 --> 17:50.292
metal stubs to the environment.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.083
A-And you're look--
you're looking to see

17:52.208 --> 17:55.125
if you can get microbes
coming from the upper atmosphere

17:55.208 --> 17:57.958
-and not from the Earth itself?
-WAINWRIGHT: That's right.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.667
All the critics say
they're coming from Earth

17:59.792 --> 18:01.167
because we're surrounded
by life.

18:01.292 --> 18:03.208
But we have lots of evidence
that this material

18:03.333 --> 18:06.667
is not coming from Earth,
it's incoming from space.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.083
I mean, this sounds incredible.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.833
I mean, have you ever
lost any of these?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.375
-No, and we're not
about to start today.
-(laughter)

18:11.542 --> 18:13.500
-So, fingers crossed, guys.
-Brilliant.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.375
NARRATOR:
The team moves the balloon
into launch position,

18:16.542 --> 18:20.083
from which it will ascend
more than 37 kilometers,

18:20.208 --> 18:22.167
or 23 miles, into the air.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.167
ROSE:
Okay, guys. Ready?

18:24.292 --> 18:25.958
-Andrew, won't you
count down, please?
-COLLINS: Okay.

18:26.042 --> 18:28.792
Five, four, three,

18:28.875 --> 18:30.250
two, one.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.417
-Let it go.
-ROSE: Oh, there it goes...

18:35.292 --> 18:37.667
NARRATOR:
Once the balloon reaches
its target altitude

18:37.833 --> 18:39.500
within the Earth's stratosphere,

18:39.583 --> 18:42.875
the capture mechanism
will hopefully collect samples

18:43.000 --> 18:46.250
of non-Earth-based
microbial life.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.667
After the sampling is complete,

18:48.792 --> 18:51.167
the balloon bursts,
and the capture mechanism

18:51.250 --> 18:55.375
descends back to Earth
under the safety of a parachute.

18:57.042 --> 19:00.250
The team uses
GPS tracking to locate

19:00.375 --> 19:02.000
where the mechanism lands.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.833
Once retrieved,
the sample is quickly secured

19:04.958 --> 19:08.833
in a sealed container so that
it does not become contaminated

19:09.000 --> 19:11.250
with microbes from Earth.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.208
Moments later,
Andrew joins Milton and Chris

19:16.333 --> 19:19.042
at a nearby laboratory.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.667
Here they will extract
the microbes

19:20.750 --> 19:24.333
inside a sterilized clean room
and then analyze them

19:24.458 --> 19:27.083
to make sure no Earth microbes

19:27.208 --> 19:29.125
have contaminated the sample.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.958
COLLINS:
A clean room.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.667
How can you ensure
the sterilization?

19:33.750 --> 19:37.500
What are the protocols
behind this process?

19:37.667 --> 19:40.292
It's really all about
sterilizing the air inside.

19:40.417 --> 19:43.167
To make sure the air inside
contains no microorganisms.

19:43.292 --> 19:45.292
So all the air is filtered.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.833
(indistinct chatter)

20:01.958 --> 20:05.083
NARRATOR:
Milton and Chris
remove the carbon tabs

20:05.208 --> 20:06.625
from the capture mechanism

20:06.708 --> 20:10.042
and place them
into vacuum-sealed containers.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.958
This will further prevent
contamination

20:12.083 --> 20:15.583
while they view the samples with
a scanning electron microscope.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.458
COLLINS:
Wow. What on earth is that?

20:19.583 --> 20:22.042
I can tell
that this is biological.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.708
If you analyze this,
I'm pretty certain

20:24.833 --> 20:28.500
this will show as carbon, oxygen
and a little bit of nitrogen.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.250
Now, that's the signature
for life.

20:31.375 --> 20:35.500
COLLINS:
We're saying that this piece
of biological life

20:35.625 --> 20:38.625
-could potentially be
extraterrestrial in origin?
-Right.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.417
WAINWRIGHT:
There's nothing
from Earth around it.

20:40.542 --> 20:43.458
It's pristine, so it's incoming.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.458
Now, if we do a bit
of, um, modeling studies,

20:46.542 --> 20:48.500
we come to the conclusion
that nothing bigger

20:48.625 --> 20:51.500
than six microns can go out.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.167
And this is 200.

20:53.333 --> 20:58.000
So it's a very large particle,
and it's coming in.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.208
What we actually
could be looking at here

21:00.375 --> 21:03.417
is a genuine alien life-form.

21:03.542 --> 21:06.333
What you're looking at there
is an organism

21:06.500 --> 21:10.708
or a clump of organisms that
is incoming from space to Earth.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.250
Nothing bigger
than six microns can go

21:15.375 --> 21:17.833
from the surface of the Earth
to these altitudes

21:17.917 --> 21:19.458
that we sample at.

21:19.583 --> 21:24.542
And yet we are finding particles
all the way up to 200.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.708
They can't be coming up
from Earth.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.542
Absolutely amazing.
It's blown my head off.

21:29.708 --> 21:32.250
NARRATOR:
Biological organisms,

21:32.375 --> 21:35.792
not from Earth
but from somewhere in space?

21:35.875 --> 21:38.333
Could we be looking
at actual evidence

21:38.458 --> 21:42.292
of a living organism
from a world other than our own?

21:42.375 --> 21:44.000
COLLINS:
We've actually found

21:44.167 --> 21:46.042
evidence of what could be

21:46.208 --> 21:50.000
extraterrestrial
biological entities.

21:50.167 --> 21:54.000
To see those images
was extraordinary,

21:54.125 --> 21:57.208
and it's convinced me
that the Earth

21:57.333 --> 21:59.250
is surrounded by life

21:59.375 --> 22:04.208
that almost certainly
came from outer space.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.417
This is one we took earlier,
as they say.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.792
This is the most amazing image
I've ever seen in my life.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.208
It's got biological
material here,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.208
and this material
we know contains carbon,

22:17.375 --> 22:20.750
oxygen and nitrogen,
so this is biological.

22:20.875 --> 22:23.875
When we analyzed the ball,
we found it contained titanium

22:24.042 --> 22:25.333
and a small amount of vanadium.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.500
So, this is a titanium sphere

22:27.583 --> 22:30.292
with life inside
and life on the outside.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.333
Now, what on earth is it?

22:32.417 --> 22:35.875
One possibility is that
this is directed panspermia.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.667
Some civilization
has put biological material

22:39.792 --> 22:42.000
inside and just
on the outside of this thing

22:42.083 --> 22:43.750
and they've spewed it out.

22:43.875 --> 22:47.167
And this suggests
that some alien civilization

22:47.250 --> 22:48.667
is seeding planets.

22:48.750 --> 22:53.125
This smoking gun
of, uh, panspermia,

22:53.208 --> 22:55.167
or even directed panspermia

22:55.292 --> 22:58.417
could give us
the best evidence yet

22:58.542 --> 23:04.500
that aliens in some form
seeded life on this Earth,

23:04.625 --> 23:07.000
which is an incredible thought.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.583
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

23:10.708 --> 23:12.708
that extraterrestrial life-forms

23:12.833 --> 23:16.375
are being deliberately sent
to planet Earth?

23:16.500 --> 23:19.125
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

23:19.250 --> 23:24.000
and suggest that archaeologists
may have actually found

23:24.125 --> 23:28.458
physical remains of the beings
who are sending them.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.333
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have traveled

23:36.417 --> 23:38.292
around the world looking
for definitive evidence

23:38.417 --> 23:41.292
to prove that we are
not alone in the universe.

23:41.375 --> 23:43.333
And what could be
more definitive

23:43.417 --> 23:45.000
than a human-like skull

23:45.083 --> 23:47.875
that appears to be something
other than human?

23:48.000 --> 23:53.333
In 2017, I got to examine
an elongated skull up close,

23:53.500 --> 23:57.917
and what I discovered
was absolutely mind-blowing.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.750
NARRATOR:
New York City,

24:02.875 --> 24:06.875
February 2017.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.750
At New York University,
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets

24:09.875 --> 24:12.500
with art collector
Jared Collins,

24:12.625 --> 24:17.250
who is in possession of a
2,000-year-old elongated skull.

24:17.375 --> 24:20.000
Oh, wow.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.667
That is fantastic.

24:22.792 --> 24:26.000
NARRATOR:
The skull is incredibly
well-preserved,

24:26.125 --> 24:29.000
and Jared is having it tested
at the university

24:29.125 --> 24:32.708
to find out if it might
possibly contain abnormalities

24:32.833 --> 24:35.875
that indicate it is
something other than human.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.292
He agreed to meet Giorgio
outside of the anthropology lab

24:39.417 --> 24:42.958
for a first look at the skull.

24:43.042 --> 24:44.667
So how did this come
to be in your possession?

24:44.833 --> 24:47.625
Well, it's not actually mine.
It is on loan to me.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.167
Me and one of my colleagues
contacted a museum

24:50.250 --> 24:53.250
and we asked them,
"Do you have an elongated skull

24:53.375 --> 24:54.708
in your collection?"

24:54.833 --> 24:57.500
And they said they have
just one, this one.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.583
TSOUKALOS:
And have they told you
anything about it?

25:00.708 --> 25:03.500
-Actually, strangely...
-TSOUKALOS: Like the providence?

25:03.667 --> 25:06.125
...this has been
in storage for decades.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.667
They have never tested it,

25:08.792 --> 25:10.208
they had very little
information on it.

25:10.375 --> 25:13.583
They know
it's absolutely Paracas.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.667
So, this skull was found
in the Paracas region

25:15.750 --> 25:17.500
-of Peru.
-That's right.

25:17.625 --> 25:20.375
But no real modern testing
has ever been done on this.

25:20.542 --> 25:22.000
Oh, this is amazing.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.167
So, let's go, right?

25:24.292 --> 25:26.083
Okay.

25:29.625 --> 25:33.542
NYU Professor of Anthropology
Dr. Todd Disotell

25:33.708 --> 25:36.208
agreed to conduct
a forensic evaluation

25:36.375 --> 25:38.167
of the elongated skull.

25:38.292 --> 25:41.417
I've seen casts,
I've never seen one in person.

25:41.542 --> 25:44.167
-Okay.
-Wow.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.958
DISOTELL:
That is freaky.

25:47.083 --> 25:51.083
I mean, I just can't come up
with another term.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.500
I love that your first reaction
is that it's freaky,

25:53.583 --> 25:54.833
-'cause I agree with you.
-Yeah, well, I mean,

25:54.917 --> 25:57.125
-look at it. That's...
-It's-it's quite bizarre.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.833
DISOTELL:
Let me just, uh, move it over

26:00.958 --> 26:03.917
-to the sterile bench surface.
-Mm-hmm.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.875
Wow.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.958
So, what's very fascinating--

26:08.042 --> 26:10.667
-besides the shape...
-(laughter)

26:10.750 --> 26:16.667
The sagittal suture looks
like it has completely fused.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.417
I'm holding it,
I'm looking at it,

26:18.542 --> 26:21.292
and it's just been
completely obliterated.

26:21.417 --> 26:23.708
NARRATOR:
The sagittal suture

26:23.833 --> 26:26.458
is the seam where the two
parietal bones of the skull

26:26.542 --> 26:28.875
come together.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.917
Although the markings may be
faint due to fusing over time,

26:34.042 --> 26:36.542
all human skulls are expected

26:36.667 --> 26:39.833
to have some evidence
of this feature.

26:39.958 --> 26:43.792
So it is curious
that this skull does not.

26:43.875 --> 26:47.333
Nor do the skulls of a number
of other mysterious specimens

26:47.458 --> 26:53.000
that have been collected
and examined by various experts.

26:53.125 --> 26:56.167
One of the great enigmas
of planet Earth

26:56.250 --> 26:58.292
is that all over the world,

26:58.417 --> 27:01.417
we find skeletons

27:01.542 --> 27:05.958
with people having
these elongated skulls.

27:08.708 --> 27:11.625
NARRATOR:
For centuries,
various Native cultures

27:11.708 --> 27:13.667
have engaged
in the ritual practice

27:13.792 --> 27:16.167
of artificially elongating
their skulls

27:16.250 --> 27:20.500
by tightly wrapping the heads of
their children through infancy.

27:20.583 --> 27:24.083
However, these skulls
still feature evidence

27:24.208 --> 27:25.917
of the cranial sutures.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.958
Okay, let's move onto extracting

27:31.083 --> 27:35.292
some tooth and bone powder
to get DNA out of that.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.667
Okay, excellent.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.333
In order to obtain

27:39.417 --> 27:41.708
the needed genetic material
from the artifact,

27:41.833 --> 27:45.125
Dr. Disotell will need
to remove a tooth

27:45.250 --> 27:47.625
and drill into it
to extract the samples.

27:50.208 --> 27:52.708
The analysis of the material
will determine the sex,

27:52.833 --> 27:56.667
ancestral lineage of both
the father and the mother,

27:56.750 --> 27:59.417
and any DNA anomalies
when compared

27:59.542 --> 28:01.833
with the current
human genetic database.

28:05.792 --> 28:07.042
Looks pretty good.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.292
We will pack this up
and send it off,

28:09.417 --> 28:13.583
and in four to six weeks
they should have the result.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.583
TSOUKALOS:
Four to six weeks, okay.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.917
-Thank you very much, really
appreciate your input on this.
-Okay.

28:18.042 --> 28:19.375
-Take care, gentlemen.
-Thanks a lot.
-You got it.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.917
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California,

28:22.042 --> 28:25.042
April 2017.

28:25.167 --> 28:28.208
All right, Todd,
you got the results?

28:28.333 --> 28:30.833
<i>Yeah, and they're
very, very interesting.</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:33.750
NARRATOR:
Two months after
their initial examination,

28:33.875 --> 28:36.833
Giorgio is online
with Dr. Disotell

28:37.000 --> 28:39.417
to receive the results
of the DNA test

28:39.542 --> 28:42.083
they performed
on the elongated skull.

28:42.208 --> 28:46.708
<i>They did get
a good, clean DNA profile</i>

28:46.833 --> 28:48.750
<i>from the maternally
inherited DNA.</i>

28:48.875 --> 28:53.958
So, this particular specimen
is actually not found

28:54.042 --> 28:57.875
in the New World, not found
amongst Native Americans,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.167
and it's typically found amongst
Europeans and Middle Easterners.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.750
<i>In fact,</i>

29:03.875 --> 29:06.042
the 100% match was
to a Scottish individual.

29:06.167 --> 29:09.500
<i>This makes no sense whatsoever.</i>

29:09.625 --> 29:12.458
Really?
In a South American skull?

29:12.542 --> 29:13.958
This is all very strange.

29:14.042 --> 29:16.667
That could mean
that people from Europe

29:16.833 --> 29:19.875
<i>got to South America</i>

29:20.000 --> 29:26.083
1,500 years earlier than
we currently understand that.

29:26.208 --> 29:27.792
That's amazing.

29:27.917 --> 29:31.417
<i>Unfortunately,
the condition of the sample</i>

29:31.542 --> 29:34.458
<i>did not yield any Y chromosome.</i>

29:34.542 --> 29:36.833
<i>But that's not surprising.</i>

29:37.000 --> 29:40.500
There is between
a couple hundred

29:40.583 --> 29:43.833
to a couple thousand times
as much

29:43.917 --> 29:47.042
<i>maternal DNA
in every cell of the body.</i>

29:47.167 --> 29:49.667
So what does that mean,
what have we not

29:49.750 --> 29:52.042
found out because of that?

29:52.167 --> 29:54.833
Well, so, one, that would
allow us to definitively

29:54.958 --> 29:56.125
<i>determine the sex,</i>

29:56.208 --> 29:59.750
<i>and knowing who the father was</i>

29:59.875 --> 30:02.750
<i>would be very, very informative.</i>

30:02.875 --> 30:05.042
<i>Unfortunately,
we're missing that.</i>

30:05.208 --> 30:06.583
Right.

30:06.708 --> 30:09.083
Do you think that a case
can be made at all--

30:09.208 --> 30:12.833
and again,
this is complete speculation--

30:13.000 --> 30:16.958
that perhaps
it is not necessarily human?

30:17.042 --> 30:19.417
Is that a possibility?

30:19.542 --> 30:21.708
<i>Well, it's possible.</i>

30:21.833 --> 30:24.833
<i>But still, we actually
don't know what this is.</i>

30:24.958 --> 30:27.250
Since we didn't get
any definitive result,

30:27.375 --> 30:30.333
obviously, a scientist
always wants to try to do that.

30:30.417 --> 30:32.208
Uh, this is extraordinary.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.500
<i>Yeah, it still leaves open
the possibility</i>

30:35.667 --> 30:37.417
of something interesting.

30:37.542 --> 30:42.083
The results confirmed the fact
that there is a mystery there.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.875
First of all,
we couldn't figure out

30:45.000 --> 30:47.333
who the father is of that thing.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.750
Number two, it has European DNA.

30:50.875 --> 30:54.000
Two things that make no sense.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.500
And it had a missing
sagittal suture.

30:56.583 --> 31:01.708
So I do think that that is
an extraterrestrial skull.

31:01.833 --> 31:05.958
NARRATOR:
Could the elongated skull
analyzed by Dr. Disotell

31:06.042 --> 31:09.000
provide evidence
that a human-like species

31:09.167 --> 31:13.833
walked planet Earth
that wasn't entirely human?

31:13.917 --> 31:16.417
Perhaps further clues
can be found

31:16.542 --> 31:18.625
by examining recent
scientific evidence

31:18.750 --> 31:21.625
that supports the theory
that life can exist

31:21.708 --> 31:24.458
where we least expect it.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.917
Many of the scientists we've
spoken to on <i>Ancient Aliens</i>

31:34.042 --> 31:36.083
believe that the best place
to search for evidence

31:36.208 --> 31:40.333
of alien life is on meteorites
that have crashed to Earth.

31:40.417 --> 31:44.500
A few years ago, I met with
a planetary scientist in England

31:44.625 --> 31:48.333
who showed me incredible
evidence that these space rocks

31:48.458 --> 31:52.708
could be delivering microbial
extraterrestrial life-forms

31:52.875 --> 31:55.833
right here to our planet.

31:55.917 --> 31:58.375
NARRATOR:
Milton Keynes, England,

31:58.500 --> 32:02.000
March 2019.

32:02.083 --> 32:06.750
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

32:06.875 --> 32:08.500
travels to The Open University

32:08.583 --> 32:12.375
to meet with planetary scientist
Dr. Queenie Chan.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.000
Dr. Chan?

32:14.125 --> 32:16.000
-Giorgio.
-Hello.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.500
-Great pleasure to meet you.
-Welcome here.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.917
Nice to meet you, too. Welcome.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.667
Thank you so much
for bringing me here.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.208
NARRATOR:
Dr. Chan recently analyzed

32:23.333 --> 32:26.917
two meteorites
recovered in 1998

32:27.042 --> 32:31.208
and discovered something
incredibly unexpected,

32:31.333 --> 32:35.417
a salt crystal
containing liquid water.

32:35.542 --> 32:38.500
Giorgio is eager to find out
what the implications

32:38.583 --> 32:40.250
of this discovery could be,

32:40.375 --> 32:42.917
and if it might provide
further evidence

32:43.042 --> 32:46.042
that life on Earth
was seeded by extraterrestrials.

32:48.042 --> 32:50.000
CHAN:
Within a stony meteorite,

32:50.167 --> 32:53.708
we've got something called
the chondritic meteorite.

32:53.833 --> 32:54.875
They are interesting
because they have

32:55.042 --> 32:57.458
organic materials in it.

32:59.542 --> 33:03.000
The meteorite that I found
extremely interesting,

33:03.167 --> 33:05.833
uh, special--
two meteorites, actually--

33:05.958 --> 33:08.000
Zag and Monahan's meteorite.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.917
They are both
ordinary chondrites,

33:11.042 --> 33:13.500
but they are not ordinary.
(chuckles)

33:15.167 --> 33:18.708
They both fell to Earth in 1998.

33:18.833 --> 33:22.583
And what's more interesting
is, both of these meteorite

33:22.708 --> 33:27.542
have salt crystal, that stunning
blue coloration to them.

33:27.667 --> 33:31.625
More interesting is,
within these salt crystals,

33:31.708 --> 33:33.000
we found water,

33:33.125 --> 33:36.750
liquid water inclusion
within them.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.500
I'm trying to wrap
my mind around this.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.625
So, you're telling me
that you found meteorites

33:40.708 --> 33:43.417
that actually contain
liquid water in them.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.042
Should we have a look at it
in the clean lab?

33:45.167 --> 33:46.750
Yes, please,
that would be amazing.

33:46.875 --> 33:48.125
Absolutely.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.333
NARRATOR:
Before they can examine

33:51.500 --> 33:55.375
the meteorite sample,
Giorgio and Dr. Chan change

33:55.500 --> 33:59.000
into protective gear that will
keep the laboratory sterile.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.000
TSOUKALOS:
Oh, nice.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.875
-And so, this is it.
-This is it.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.375
-Should we have
a look under the microscope?
-Yes, please, yes.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.250
CHAN:
Trying to move that
in focus now.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.417
There it is.

34:16.542 --> 34:20.208
I'm going to enlarge it
on my screen.

34:20.333 --> 34:24.333
This is it. You're looking at
a speck of water in a meteorite.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.500
This is the first time
that we've found

34:26.667 --> 34:29.167
amino acids with water.

34:29.292 --> 34:31.167
This is extraordinary.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.417
NARRATOR:
Amino acids?

34:34.542 --> 34:37.667
These organic compounds
are the building blocks of life,

34:37.833 --> 34:41.000
so finding them within
liquid water on a meteorite

34:41.125 --> 34:43.542
is extraordinary.

34:43.667 --> 34:48.583
Could alien proteins like these
have started life on Earth?

34:50.667 --> 34:52.833
One of the exciting things about
the discovery of the blue

34:52.958 --> 34:55.250
salt crystals in the asteroids
that crashed to Earth

34:55.375 --> 34:58.083
is really the amino acids.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.667
Amino acids are
the building block of protein,

35:00.833 --> 35:04.333
and so it really shows
that Earth isn't the only place

35:04.458 --> 35:07.583
where the right chemistry exists
for which you can get life.

35:07.708 --> 35:09.542
In another laboratory,

35:09.667 --> 35:12.667
Dr. Chan shows Giorgio
the machine that analyzed

35:12.750 --> 35:15.625
the meteorite samples
on a nanometer scale.

35:15.708 --> 35:19.542
The results are then
displayed on a computer screen,

35:19.708 --> 35:22.167
showing a comparison
between amino acids

35:22.292 --> 35:25.708
found on Earth and those
that arrived here from space.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.208
This is very interesting,
because, uh, first of all,

35:29.375 --> 35:31.125
we see a bunch of amino acids

35:31.250 --> 35:34.583
that are common
in-in terrestrial life.

35:34.708 --> 35:36.792
And over here,
we've got other extraterrestrial

35:36.875 --> 35:38.875
-amino acid inside.
-Really?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.250
This is
a revolutionary discovery.

35:42.375 --> 35:46.333
I immediately go to the idea
of panspermia,

35:46.458 --> 35:50.417
that life has been brought
throughout the entire galaxy

35:50.542 --> 35:55.083
by means with which we can't
even fathom how it was done.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.042
The building blocks of protein

35:57.167 --> 35:59.375
that we know to be
necessary for life,

35:59.500 --> 36:01.042
these very building blocks,

36:01.167 --> 36:02.875
the same amino acids
that we found on Earth,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.333
is ubiquitous
in the, in the universe.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.333
It's everywhere.
It's found on-on asteroid.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.792
It's found on-on comets, too.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.833
So, in your estimation,
what is the likelihood

36:13.000 --> 36:17.042
of life having begun elsewhere?

36:17.167 --> 36:19.417
We've got so many
different galaxies

36:19.542 --> 36:22.208
and there are
so many Earth-like planets

36:22.333 --> 36:25.125
and, uh, we-we could have
water elsewhere.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.542
We know that amino acids,

36:26.667 --> 36:28.792
building blocks of life,
are ubiquitous,

36:28.875 --> 36:32.667
um, so I think
it's-it's totally possible.

36:35.125 --> 36:39.375
NARRATOR:
Could these incredible findings
be proof that the seeds of life

36:39.542 --> 36:43.167
traveled to Earth from
other planets in our galaxy?

36:43.292 --> 36:46.375
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

36:46.542 --> 36:49.333
and believe that further
evidence can be found

36:49.417 --> 36:51.000
in the recent NASA discovery

36:51.125 --> 36:54.417
that there might be
life on Mars.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.208
The search for evidence
of extraterrestrial life

37:02.375 --> 37:05.000
has taken <i>Ancient Aliens</i>
from deep in the jungle

37:05.083 --> 37:07.458
all the way up
to a remote mountain cave.

37:07.542 --> 37:10.333
But perhaps one of the most
compelling places to look

37:10.458 --> 37:12.583
is not on our planet at all.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.167
In recent years,
new research has suggested

37:15.292 --> 37:18.833
that Mars
may actually support life.

37:18.917 --> 37:23.500
And in 2018, aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

37:23.625 --> 37:27.542
traveled to NASA to learn
about an exciting new discovery

37:27.667 --> 37:32.750
and to see a piece of the Red
Planet right here on Earth.

37:38.042 --> 37:41.375
NARRATOR:
Scientist and aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

37:41.500 --> 37:45.333
travels to Johnson
Space Center and meets

37:45.500 --> 37:49.625
with NASA exploration mission
scientist Dr. Elizabeth Rampe.

37:49.750 --> 37:53.917
Dr. Rampe analyzes data obtained
by the Mars <i>Curiosity</i> rover,

37:54.042 --> 37:56.500
which, six years
into its mission,

37:56.583 --> 37:59.958
is sending back some of its most
extraordinary findings yet.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.167
So, there was very
late-breaking news recently

38:05.250 --> 38:07.208
from the <i>Curiosity</i> rover.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.417
And some interesting
information came out

38:09.542 --> 38:12.667
of the Sample Analysis at Mars,
or SAM, instrument.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.292
-Okay.
-So, SAM can measure gases

38:15.375 --> 38:17.208
in the atmosphere,
and it can also measure gases

38:17.333 --> 38:20.125
that are evolved from samples.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.000
So basically, we drill a rock,

38:23.167 --> 38:26.083
deliver that powder
to the instrument,

38:26.208 --> 38:28.250
and then that instrument
heats up the sample

38:28.375 --> 38:31.333
and measures the gases
that are coming off.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.542
Whatever out gas is,
it can tell you what this--

38:33.667 --> 38:35.208
-what that is, right? Okay.
-Exactly.

38:35.375 --> 38:38.500
So, a big piece of information
from the atmosphere

38:38.625 --> 38:40.875
is that we've been
tracking methane

38:41.000 --> 38:43.583
over the last few Martian years,

38:43.708 --> 38:47.500
and what we see is that
there is a cycle to it,

38:47.625 --> 38:50.333
where it spikes late summer,
early autumn,

38:50.458 --> 38:51.792
and then dips again.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.333
-Wow. Yeah.
-Yeah, so the big question

38:54.458 --> 38:57.542
-is, why is that happening?
-Right, that-- it-it, so--

38:57.667 --> 39:00.583
that's-- could possibly be due
to an organic material, right?

39:00.708 --> 39:02.375
-Or a biological source.
-Exactly.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.625
-So, that's...
-Meaning life.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.333
-Right, I know, so: huge.
-Right-right. Wow.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.292
I-It's not the only
hypothesis out there...

39:07.417 --> 39:09.333
-Sure.
-...but you know,

39:09.417 --> 39:11.583
there is the possibility
that there is

39:11.708 --> 39:14.958
extant life on Mars
that is creating this methane.

39:15.042 --> 39:17.208
Wow.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.625
The fact that NASA has now
released information

39:19.750 --> 39:22.917
that they've measured
a cycle of methane

39:23.042 --> 39:25.958
that goes up in the summer
and down in the winter,

39:26.083 --> 39:30.167
it sounds very similar
to how biological processes

39:30.250 --> 39:32.125
create methane here on Earth.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.333
That could be evidence

39:34.458 --> 39:37.167
that there's life,
right now, on Mars.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.542
NARRATOR:
Life on Mars?

39:40.708 --> 39:43.375
According to NASA,
such a profound notion

39:43.542 --> 39:46.000
is a distinct possibility.

39:46.125 --> 39:49.583
And other discoveries
made by the space agency could

39:49.708 --> 39:51.917
reveal something even more
incredible,

39:52.042 --> 39:56.417
that life on Earth
actually originated on Mars.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.208
So what is this?
Tell me what this is.

40:00.333 --> 40:03.375
Okay, so this is
a Martian meteorite.

40:03.542 --> 40:07.500
So this is a rock
that came from Mars.

40:07.583 --> 40:09.042
-TAYLOR: How long ago?
-The rock itself is about

40:09.167 --> 40:11.500
180 million years old.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.167
-Wow.
-So that's when
it crystallized on Mars.

40:13.292 --> 40:15.167
And to give you some context,

40:15.292 --> 40:16.833
180 million years ago,

40:16.917 --> 40:18.708
-dinosaurs were
roaming the Earth.
-Right.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.833
TAYLOR:
Well, we know that this rock
came from Mars.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.125
So if there was
organic material on Mars

40:24.208 --> 40:25.792
three and a half
billion years ago,

40:25.875 --> 40:27.667
something could have
caused that organic material

40:27.750 --> 40:30.542
to go from there to here, right?

40:30.667 --> 40:32.458
Right, and what's interesting
about, you know,

40:32.542 --> 40:34.500
"three and a half
billion years ago"

40:34.583 --> 40:38.000
is, that's when life
was taking hold on Earth.

40:38.167 --> 40:41.500
-Right.
-So-- And-and Mars
was once very Earth-like,

40:41.583 --> 40:44.750
with, uh, rivers and lakes.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.667
So why not Mars?

40:46.750 --> 40:49.000
We've got all the building
blocks for life on Mars,

40:49.125 --> 40:51.292
-so why couldn't
it happen there?
-So it's very possible

40:51.375 --> 40:53.167
that we're descendants
of Martians.

40:53.292 --> 40:56.417
-I-I... I'm not gonna
rule that out.
-(chuckles)

41:00.708 --> 41:03.667
When you look at all of
the evidence that's out there,

41:03.792 --> 41:06.292
from microbes
in the stratosphere

41:06.375 --> 41:09.625
to strange signals
coming from space

41:09.708 --> 41:13.500
and even ancient bones
that defy explanation,

41:13.667 --> 41:18.542
you have to ask, have we already
discovered alien life?

41:18.667 --> 41:21.083
The answer is a resounding yes.

41:21.208 --> 41:25.000
And I have no doubt
that far more incredible proof

41:25.125 --> 41:26.458
is yet to come.
