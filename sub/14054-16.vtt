00:02.440 --> 00:04.237
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Looks like I'm dateless.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.311
- We'll be your date, right?
- Yeah, right.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.118
The guy seems cool, right? 

00:08.280 --> 00:10.271
- We don't have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.556
- So you chose Anna?
- Kind of, yeah.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.280
- Can we still all hang out?
- Sure.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.954
All this talk about plans,
about growing up, it's a routine.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.998
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the reason we put up with you.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.678
- Hey!
- I'm a cop. He tried to buy coke from me.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.832
- You must like me to get me out of jail.
- That was Sandy.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.150
- You gonna tell her?
- You are.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.998
- Howdy.
- Hey.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.549
Sorry to just pop in.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.109
Is it okay if I come in?

00:45.280 --> 00:47.669
Yeah, sure. Of course.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.519
It's just temporary.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.392
The place. It's just temporary.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.235
- My dad lost his job, so my parents...
- I don't judge.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.437
I do, however, apologize.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.791
- The other night, Marissa, was...
- It's okay. Really.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.678
No. No, it's not.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.276
I hit rock bottom.
A new low, even for me.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.715
But it was eye-opening.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.634
A call to arms. I called my parents.
I came clean about everything.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.153
And they were so supportive.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.039
I talked to my sponsor.
I'm going to meetings again.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.830
And I totally was honest with Natalie
about all our issues.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.070
We're getting back together.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.470
Wow. That's amazing.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.871
And it never would've happened
if Ryan hadn't come to my rescue.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.792
He called Mr. Cohen.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.918
I mean, busted trying to buy coke?

01:46.080 --> 01:48.389
I should still be in jail.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.233
Ryan helped me get a second chance.
I want to say thanks.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.231
Oh, so do you want his number?

01:55.400 --> 01:59.109
I want to take you and him
to Palm Springs.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.358
My family has a place there, right on
PGA West. It'll be great. It'll be great.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.830
We can bring all your friends.
Seth, Anna, Summer.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.514
Even Luke.
You can meet my folks, meet Natalie.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.669
Palm Springs?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.990
Oh, it's so much fun.
The weather there is perfect.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.071
- Do you golf?
- No. Not really.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.595
I'll teach you. Ryan too.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.308
Well, I do really want
to meet Natalie.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.869
She's dying to meet both of you guys.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.237
A little getaway, just the gang.
On me.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.870
- It's the least I can do.
- It sounds amazing.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.793
You know, let me
just call Ryan and ask him.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.960 --> 03:33.838
All right, knees bent.
Not quite that much.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.037
Back straight,
eyes right over the ball.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.272
Feet a little closer together.
Just off your left foot. There you go.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.637
Not quite that close together,
but that's okay.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.712
All right, just let it hang
like a pendulum.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.110
Nice and easy.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.350
Nice and easy. Keep breathing.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.034
Nice and easy.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.792
Nice...

03:55.960 --> 03:58.918
I'll stop.
I'll just go right over here.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.514
I got it.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.711
- All right, one more.
- No. No more.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.269
Come on, you were so good
at the driving range.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.829
- I don't play golf.
- Not true. You just don't play well.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.673
You know, there's more to do
in Palm Springs than play golf.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.192
- You can spa.
- I don't spa.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.192
You don't play golf, you don't spa.
What do you do?

04:21.360 --> 04:25.478
What exactly do you do,
besides musicals and punching people?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.438
- Well, he's very good with the ladies.
- The ladies.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.433
- He's very good with the ladies.
- Very good with the ladies.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.115
- He's right here holding a golf club.
- Yeah, but you don't know how to use it.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.157
Which is why I'm not going
to Palm Springs.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.878
Hey. Yes, you are going
to Palm Springs.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.315
Listen to me.
You did something nice for Oliver.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.756
Now he wants to repay you by taking us
to his mansion in Palm Springs.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.434
Without you, there is no deal.
Why can't you understand?

04:47.600 --> 04:50.239
- He has a mansion on a golf course?
- And a ski chalet in Mammoth.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.638
- I guess sometimes it's good to be Oliver.
- Sometimes it's great to be Oliver.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.073
But you or I don't care
about those things, do we?

04:58.240 --> 05:01.198
- Or Marissa. I don't think she cares either.
- You think?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.830
I don't know. But even if she's
a little bit impressed, look over there.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.228
Who's got himself a pool house?

05:06.400 --> 05:09.198
With ocean views.
Here, take another shot.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.588
Nice and easy.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.514
- So Oliver's parents are gonna be there?
- Yeah.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.557
- Have you met them?
- No.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.156
But, if they're anywhere
near as cool as Oliver...

05:25.040 --> 05:26.473
I don't do nice and easy.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.790
- Do we trust this Oliver kid?
- No. Not at all.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.793
But we trust our guys,
and his parents are supposed to be there.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.713
- And Seth knows to call hourly?
- Yeah, and...

05:34.880 --> 05:36.871
...we're just gonna worry
all weekend.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.718
They're golfing.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.438
When we gonna get you
on the golf course?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.034
Not today.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.589
Do you know
who's coming home today?

05:45.760 --> 05:49.389
God, the ugly Americans are coming back.
When do your father and Julie get in?

05:49.560 --> 05:51.232
They arrive from Paris
this afternoon.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.472
After confirming Europe's worst
suspicions of Americans, I'm guessing.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.235
Well, I'm guessing that this means
that Hailey will be on the way out.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.756
What's she gonna do? Hit your dad up
for a blank check and then take off?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.273
Was there ever any doubt?

06:03.440 --> 06:08.195
I mean, last time she was gone
for two years. This time it could be three.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.590
Who knows what trouble
she can get into.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.150
- Morning.
- Hey, Hailey. Can I get you anything?

06:14.320 --> 06:15.469
I got those pumpkin muffins.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.518
And there's coffee
and there's orange juice without pulp.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.514
- Dad comes back today, huh?
- Right. Yes, he does.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.553
- So, what time will we be seeing him?
- Dinner. Seven.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.154
I'm sorry, I'll have to miss that.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.273
Julie Cooper's not coming, is she?

06:34.080 --> 06:37.755
I can't believe Dad's with her.
She's only with him for his money.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.990
And that is such
an unattractive quality.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.275
- Pumpkin muffin?
- Yes, darling?

06:47.560 --> 06:49.118
- I think it'll be fun.
- You do?

06:49.280 --> 06:53.068
What could be more fun than joining
you guys for Couple Fest 2004?

06:53.240 --> 06:57.791
You and Ryan, Oliver and Natalie,
Anna and What's-His-Face Cohen.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.871
Me and Luke.
God, it should be all-time.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.919
It won't be like that. It'll be a chance
to get out of town, hang out. It'll be fun.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.196
What's more fun than watching
some nerdy neurotic bat...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.430
...his eyelashes at his pixie chick?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.478
So clearly you're okay
with being just friends with Seth.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.071
- Clearly.
- I was being sarcastic.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.593
So was I.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.594
Which we never were before Cohen
showed up and taught us all irony.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.115
- Jackass.
- Hey, Summ.

07:22.280 --> 07:26.717
Look, if it's too hard to be around him,
then why go? Why do this to yourself?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.235
Because I told them
that I was fine with it.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.868
I told them I was cool
just being their friend.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.519
I have a reputation.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.150
- And I can't sabotage the trip from here.
- Summer.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.518
Okay, what do you think about
laxatives in his coffee, huh?

07:43.320 --> 07:45.993
No. Okay, dead frog
in his <i>X- Men</i> Underoos?

07:46.160 --> 07:47.149
That's good. No.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.117
No. I've got it.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.158
While he's sleeping,
I slip his hand in warm water.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.392
It makes you pee your bed.
Anna wakes up, sees he's a bed wetter...

07:55.560 --> 07:58.120
...and that is awesome!
That is just...

07:58.280 --> 08:00.236
...awesome.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.799
- I've lost my mind, haven't I?
- Yeah, little bit.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.430
And over Seth Cohen.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.359
Jimmy. Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.
We're still on for dinner tonight, right?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.592
Dinner? Yeah.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.193
You okay?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.028
No, I'm not really.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.079
I just got turned down
for a manager's position in this place.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.390
Apparently, that kid is better suited
to the rigors of the job than I am.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.278
We should reschedule.
I'm not feeling social.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.668
We can't reschedule.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.831
The Lighthouse closes down
tonight forever.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.798
It's the last chance to get
the best chicken parmigiana around.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.509
First The Lighthouse leaves Newport
and then me. How poetic.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.910
- What do you mean?
- There's nothing here for me.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.196
There's no opportunities,
no second chances.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.592
I got a brother in Phoenix.
He called me this week and...

08:54.760 --> 08:56.716
- You can't leave.
- Well, I can't stay.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.314
I'm headed to work.
I know we have positions available.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.436
No, Sandy, you can't. You've done...

09:01.600 --> 09:05.229
It'll be nothing glamorous, just entry-level.
Paralegal work, that kind of thing.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.030
Thanks. I mean, whatever it is.
Just as long as I can stay with Marissa.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.476
I can't afford to support
the both of us much longer.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.677
- We'll figure it out.
- Thanks.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.310
You can't bail on me tonight, because
I'll be stuck with Hailey and Caleb.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.835
- It's the least you can do. All right.
- Yeah. Thanks.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.270
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:25.960 --> 09:32.308
All right. And so it begins. Guess I'm
just gonna have to get used to this.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.716
Seth's in his room.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.590
It's upstairs to the left, right?

09:37.760 --> 09:41.275
I'm just gonna make sure he's packed,
so he doesn't hold us up.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.150
You know, we need
to be nice to Summer.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.552
She's afraid this weekend is just gonna be
a bunch of couples doing couple-y stuff.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.392
And it's not?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.433
So we'll be hanging out with,
say, Oliver?

09:54.600 --> 09:57.194
Oliver and Natalie. They made up.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.158
- Do you have a problem with Oliver?
- No.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.197
I mean, a guy shows up
out of nowhere...

10:02.360 --> 10:04.351
...and suddenly he's hanging
around all the time.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.035
Yeah, a guy shows up out of the blue,
knows no one, abandoned by his family.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.873
Sound familiar?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.234
A little bit.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.756
Look, you did something nice for him,
and now he wants to repay you.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.388
- By playing golf?
- Yeah. Well, it'll be fun.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.198
You've never seen me play golf.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.238
Then I guess
it'll be especially fun for me.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.032
I love Palm Springs.
A little golf, a little <i>shvitz.</i>

10:31.560 --> 10:34.518
I don't know.
It all sounds kind of old.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.830
Yes. Anna, it does sound old.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.231
And somewhere inside me there's
an old Jewish man who's very excited.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.231
- That came out a little disgusting.
- Kind of.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.311
But, seriously,
there's the geriatric part of me...

10:46.480 --> 10:49.153
...that actually loves
a good early-bird special...

10:49.320 --> 10:51.311
...a little bit of shuffleboard,
some mahjong.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.869
Well, when you put it that way.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.598
Seriously, think about it.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.196
Most old people are too actually old
to enjoy being old.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.148
Not me, though. I'm ready to retire
right now to a life of leisure.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.915
- Palm Springs is my Mecca.
- Well, what I'm looking forward to...

11:07.080 --> 11:10.755
...is a weekend alone
without our parents.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.549
I see where you're going with this.
We can have dinner as early as we want.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.834
It'll be a couples' weekend.
We can have our own room.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.231
- Be still, my pacemaker.
- You dirty old man.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.153
Hey, if the orthopedic shoe fits...

11:28.320 --> 11:31.198
Hello, friends.
Are you guys almost ready to go?

11:31.360 --> 11:32.998
- Yeah, totally.
- Hey, Summer.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.469
Well, that is just great, you guys.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.797
Sorry. God, Anna, it looked like
you were doing so well too.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.473
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks for being so forgiving.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.236
We are gonna have so much fun
this weekend. All of us hanging out.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.674
As friends.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.996
- Did you rob a liquor store, Luke?
- You can't play golf without a buzz on.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.230
Hey. Good tip, Bagger Vance.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.591
A blender. Nice thinking, Cohen.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.069
Yeah, no. It's actually a humidifier.
I get nose bleeds.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.350
- How romantic.
- I think it's sweet.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.795
- It'll make our room a tropical paradise.
- It will.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.397
You know, it is so nice how you find all
of Cohen's weaknesses so adorable.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.120
I'm not weak, okay?
I'm just delicate.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.319
Well, looks like you and I
are the only ones without anyone.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.199
Okay, I'm just gonna lie down
in the driveway.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.396
Just back your truck right up over me.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.829
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.312
- What's the matter?
- It's Natalie. It's over.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.596
I don't know. Sorry.
Maybe we shouldn't go.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.159
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.952
- What happened?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.237
No, you need to. And, you know what,
we need to get out of town.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.039
I mean, maybe we could talk
about it on the ride down.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.998
Well, is that okay?
If I ride with Oliver?

12:57.160 --> 13:01.790
- Or maybe we could all go together?
- No, you guys go. I'll see you down there.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.070
Hey, Chino!
Why don't you ride with me.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.190
- Can I ride with you guys?
- Yeah, sure.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.759
Shotgun.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.956
Thanks for understanding.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.318
Dad. Julie. You're early.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.198
<i>Bonjour,</i> Kiki.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.233
- Cheese wheel? It's brie.
- Oh, thanks.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.517
- How was France?
- Aside from the French...

13:45.800 --> 13:47.313
Where's Hailey?

13:47.480 --> 13:50.950
She's showering, I think.
I wasn't expecting you guys so soon.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.430
He couldn't wait to see his precious
Hailey. Couldn't even let me shower.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.670
How is she? How's she looking?
Too thin?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.432
She looks good. Her spirits are high.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.875
- She's high?
- No, her spirits. Her mood. She's up.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.759
- So she's on uppers?
- No, she seems balanced.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.117
- You changed your hair.
- Do you like it? Isn't it <i>Fran Ìais</i> ?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.840
- Cal says he doesn't like it.
- Hey, Dad.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.433
Hailey.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.718
It's great to see you.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.557
- Julie. Your hair.
- Hailey. You're here.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.637
I haven't seen you since...
How long has it been?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.155
Dad, are you gonna
start with me already?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.834
Fair enough. Just tell me
what you been up to.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.117
- All your adventures.
- I thought we could swing by the house...

14:35.280 --> 14:37.510
Kiki, could you make us some lunch?
I'm starved.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.875
So tell me about Costa Rica.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.474
How about lunch? We have brie.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.915
- Brought enough beer?
- Oh, you never know, buddy.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.798
You never know.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.028
- Hey. You made it.
- Yeah.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.839
We tried following you,
but it was hard to keep up.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.073
Sorry. I guess I got all wrapped up
in my saga. I got a little distracted.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.952
This place is awesome.
Where's the fridge?

15:15.120 --> 15:18.999
- I don't want these to get skunked.
- Yeah, I'll show you the kitchen.

15:23.200 --> 15:27.557
- Think you brought enough beer, man?
- Everybody keeps saying that.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.110
- How was it?
- It was okay. We talked.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.194
He talked mostly.
He just wanted someone to listen.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.870
How's he?

15:37.240 --> 15:41.028
He's a little fragile. But, hey,
I think getting out of town will help.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.477
Hope you guys weren't talking
about me when I was gone.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.269
Sorry for taking your girlfriend away from
you. But don't worry, she's all yours.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.318
- I wasn't worried.
- Right.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.073
Okay...

15:55.440 --> 15:57.874
I was trying to give you
some culture, Cohen.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.395
The audio version of <i>The</i>
<i>Da Vinci Code</i> is not culture.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.677
- Yeah, well, it's a true story.
- Hey.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.717
God!

16:06.440 --> 16:10.479
Hey, Dad. How are you doing? Six calls
in two hours. That's a new record.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.198
Yeah. No. We...

16:12.360 --> 16:15.511
We're still fine,
believe it or not. Okay.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.116
Okay, what I can do, then,
is call you from every hole. Cool?

16:19.280 --> 16:22.113
Okay, great. Bye.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.871
Where are your folks?

16:25.560 --> 16:28.154
Yeah, their plane got delayed
in Zurich.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.917
I don't think they're
gonna make it this weekend.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.629
- Welcome to their humble abode.
- Thanks, man.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.678
Now let's get everyone settled
before we hit the links, huh?

16:37.840 --> 16:41.355
I set up two tee times. I figured Seth,
Summer and Anna could be a threesome.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.073
Let me show everyone to their room.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.789
And last but not least...

16:47.240 --> 16:51.153
Oh, I forgot this is the room
with the two twins.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.437
Do you want to switch rooms?
Or we could push them together?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.556
Oh, no, this is fine. It's great.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.439
- I'm just gonna go change.
- Okay.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.079
I'll help you with the beds.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.751
Hopefully it won't be
too uncomfortable.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.751
All right, thanks.

17:08.079 --> 17:11.516
I really appreciate you being so cool
about Marissa and I being friends.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.873
Well, yeah, no problem.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.512
I mean, with everything you two
just went through with Luke...

17:19.680 --> 17:22.877
...the last thing you need
is another guy not to trust.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.834
- With Luke?
- Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.276
You thinking that maybe he and Marissa
were getting back together.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.192
That was a while ago.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.434
I'm not judging. I mean, if anyone
should have trust issues...

17:35.600 --> 17:38.034
- What does that mean?
- Just your background.

17:38.200 --> 17:42.113
Marissa was filling me in
on some of the details on our ride down.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.759
- She was?
- Yeah.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.072
But, I mean, just in terms of how amazing
it is that you're so healthy.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.193
Well-adjusted. Considering.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.388
Considering?

17:59.320 --> 18:01.436
- So how do I look?
- Perfect.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.715
Yeah, great.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.675
Sandy Cohen working on a Saturday.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.718
Tom Wellington, how are you?
Playing catch-up, huh?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.836
Buying some time
away from the wife and kids.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.036
How touching.
Listen, I got a question for you.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.954
Celeste in Records is going on maternity
leave, and we haven't found anyone yet.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.554
- You know Jimmy Cooper, right?
- Jimmy Cooper?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.995
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

18:22.160 --> 18:25.038
This is one of the most
reputable firms in the county.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.033
What's it gonna do for our profile,
hiring a notorious criminal?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.316
There's no such thing
as bad publicity.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.994
Before he went down,
there was no one smarter than Jimmy.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.799
- Everyone in this town loved him.
- Till he ripped them off.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.316
He made a mistake, he's paying it off.
He doesn't deserve a second chance?

18:39.480 --> 18:42.074
Not in our firm.
Not in this lifetime.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.994
The best thing you can do around Jimmy?
Stand upwind. Don't get his stink on you.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.149
He's a good guy, Tom.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.039
Yeah? Well, then, why don't you
go into business with him?

18:51.920 --> 18:54.798
She so looks like Mom, it's scary.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.475
He takes one look at Hailey
and he can't say no.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.948
And right now,
she's telling him of her plan...

19:02.120 --> 19:05.749
...to help the indigent population
of some depressed country.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.151
And all she's looking for
is some all-expense-paid bender...

19:09.320 --> 19:11.390
...to Amsterdam or Thailand.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.836
It's amazing he can't see it. She's only
being nice to him for his money.

19:15.360 --> 19:19.592
Every time she vanishes,
it's for a little while longer.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.113
The trips get wilder and wilder.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.355
One of these days,
I don't think she's coming back.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.035
You know you're the only one
he listens to, Kirsten.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.078
If you're really scared
she's gonna disappear again...

19:36.240 --> 19:38.708
...you need to stop him
from letting her.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.879
- How's this?
- Pretty good.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.669
You just gotta get your hips
into it a little more.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.159
You know, you gotta go:

20:00.600 --> 20:02.397
I think she's got the idea.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.238
Rock and fire.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.189
For a beautiful girl,
that is one ugly swing.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.316
Got to follow that, huh?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.833
Don't suppose you were using
creative visualization?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.594
My face as the golf ball?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.557
Can't wait to see
your short game, buddy.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.871
- I think your ball's in the trees.
- That's bad, right?

20:43.280 --> 20:46.716
Thanks for carrying my golf bag,
Cohen. I really think I threw out my back.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.314
If your back hurts,
why don't we take a golf cart?

20:49.480 --> 20:51.357
What? Are you, like, against nature?

20:51.520 --> 20:54.318
- This isn't nature. This is a golf course.
- I have a hernia.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.314
You guys, this way we can spend
more time together as friends.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.357
How come when she says "friends,"
it sounds like a threat?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.317
It's her inflection.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.115
What? We did say we'd try and be
friends. Who's she gonna talk to? Luke?

21:09.280 --> 21:12.158
The guy only recently
learned how to walk upright.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.519
Cohen...

21:16.680 --> 21:18.318
...could you help me find my ball?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.040
Anna, stay back.
There might be poison ivy.

21:21.200 --> 21:25.193
- Summer, I don't wanna get poison ivy.
- Cohen, I thought you were my friend.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.078
Okay.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.398
Looks like Summer's not
the only one who lost their balls.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.878
- Too bad.
- I could hurt that guy.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.156
So could I.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.870
Am I trying too hard with him?
All I want is to be friends.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.031
I just feel like he hates me.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.230
No. I mean... He likes you.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.517
- He just...
- Right. Trust issues.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.036
- Can't win them all, I guess.
- Hey, nobody's looking.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.748
Oh, nice shot, buddy!

22:04.920 --> 22:07.957
Okay. I think we've torn up
the course long enough.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.998
Last guy back buys the first round.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.917
Come on.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.756
Step on it. Come on.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.031
Come on, they're gaining on us.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.834
You better run!

23:02.440 --> 23:05.750
Look out! Ryan, stop, stop!

23:08.280 --> 23:11.078
Dude, nice driving.
You made that thing dance.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.832
What the hell is your problem, man?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.194
Hey, man...

23:14.360 --> 23:16.715
- I thought we were just joking.
- Yeah. Good joke.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.236
- Come down here, tell me another one.
- Oh, sorry, man.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.516
See you back at the house, okay?

23:25.160 --> 23:26.798
Are you okay?

23:26.960 --> 23:29.030
You know, he was just playing.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.194
Fine.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.990
That guy was not playing.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.716
- Hey.
- You look nice.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.235
You look like you're not
having dinner with your father.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.358
I'm gonna give them one-on-one time.
It's not a dinner I want to be at.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.990
I feel the same way about my meal.
Jimmy's right. He is done here.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.594
His best shot is starting over
somewhere else.

23:56.760 --> 24:01.197
So we'll have a nice meal, a couple
of drinks and talk about his next move.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.999
Alcohol? Yes. Inspired.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.230
How do you think
I got you to marry me?

24:06.400 --> 24:09.790
So you were drunk.
Explains everything, Kiki.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.279
Hey, Dad.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.671
It is always such a pleasure.
You two have the time of your lives.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.998
- You're not dressed.
- I'm not going.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.869
- We both know why Hailey's here.
- She wants to catch up...

24:22.040 --> 24:25.316
...with her family.
- Dad, you honestly don't believe that.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.472
Don't be jealous of your sister.
I love both my daughters equally.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.278
You don't, but that's okay.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.955
What's not okay is that she wants to take
advantage of how much you love her.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.351
- You want me to cut her off?
- I know you do too.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.274
Dinner at 6, in bed by 8.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.115
Anna, my old Jewish man
is very happy right now.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.038
It's pretty humid, Seth.
I think you could stop futzing.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.829
No. No, I can't. Futzing's what I do,
my darling. Besides, I almost have it.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.158
And there we go.
She's purring like a kitten.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.795
So, Cohen.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.873
You and me, alone in a bed.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.753
Polyfill. It's not as comfortable as down,
but it's good for our allergies, our sniffles.

25:13.440 --> 25:18.514
And this bed, huh?
It's Posturepedic for my back.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.113
And your back.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.151
- Yes?
- My catheter fell out.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.712
Hey, guys.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.595
Hey.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.796
Luke's hogging the remote,
and it's either football or porn.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.871
So could I watch TV with you guys?

25:34.040 --> 25:37.350
- We're not watching TV, Summer.
- Yeah, we were about to go to bed.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.875
- But it's 8:00. What are you, 70?
- On the inside, yes.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.952
I thought this was a weekend
where we could hang out as friends.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.992
- It is.
- Totally.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.310
Oh, I get it.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.438
It's, like, specific friend hours, right?
Whatever works for you?

25:50.600 --> 25:53.034
A friend on-off switch.
A friend appointment book.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.112
- Do I schedule friend time in advance?
- No, that is not it at all.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.316
- It's not it.
- Great. You guys.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.591
That's great.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.277
That Enrique is so hot.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.955
I mean, can you imagine
being with a guy with abs like that?

26:11.720 --> 26:13.870
Yeah, apparently not.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.316
You don't have to do that.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.357
I don't mind.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.950
Well, at least let me help.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.799
- Where's Marissa?
- Getting changed for the hot tub.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.317
You going in?

26:36.760 --> 26:38.352
Right.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.515
Can...? Can we just start over?

26:42.640 --> 26:43.914
Start over?

26:44.920 --> 26:47.514
Yeah, I feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

26:47.680 --> 26:53.391
And I wanna make this right. Get this
thing straight, so we can be friends.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.308
What can I do?

26:55.920 --> 26:58.514
Next time you wanna be
alone with my girlfriend...

26:58.680 --> 27:00.830
...let me know so I can stay home.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.470
This always happens.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.554
Natalie. My friends at Pacific.
And now you.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.599
I'm so stupid!

27:14.760 --> 27:16.990
- Take it easy.
- Damn it!

27:19.800 --> 27:23.156
Everybody who knows me for more
than five minutes ends up hating my guts.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.880
- That's not true. Nobody hates your guts.
- What's going on?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.031
We were... We were talking.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.515
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

27:31.680 --> 27:33.875
I'm gonna go get some
fresh air and...

27:34.040 --> 27:36.031
- I'll get some stuff for breakfast.
- I'll go too.

27:36.200 --> 27:40.113
No, just... Just stay with Ryan.
I'll be back soon. Just...

27:40.280 --> 27:43.511
Just leave the kitchen, man.
Everything's okay.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.316
You managed to drive him
out of his own house?

27:47.480 --> 27:49.710
I don't know.
We were talking, and he went off.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.395
What were you talking about
that was so upsetting?

27:53.560 --> 27:55.551
- You.
- Me?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.553
You and him.

27:57.720 --> 28:01.030
You know what? Oliver's got problems,
but you're the one who's paranoid.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.356
- What's your problem?
- I don't know.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.829
Maybe that you spent the ride
telling him about me.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.515
I wasn't. I was talking about my life.
And you're part of my life.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.437
You know what? I don't understand
what's going on with you.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.638
- There's gotta be more I can do.
- Sandy, you've done everything you can.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.915
- No, no.
- You know what?

28:23.080 --> 28:25.196
You're right, it's for the best.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.669
Like you said, I can start over,
have a new life.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.957
I never really wanted to be
a financial planner. Or a thief.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.998
Okay, so figure out right now.
What is it you really wanna do?

28:34.160 --> 28:38.119
What I really wanna do is not be
40 years old, divorced, with two kids...

28:38.280 --> 28:40.589
...and trying to figure out
what I really want to do.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.990
- What is it you used to want to be?
- A pilot.

28:43.160 --> 28:46.994
You know, I always liked
stewardesses. You?

28:47.160 --> 28:50.470
I always wanted to be left fielder
for the New York Yankees.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.915
It was that dream that
carried me through law school.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.313
The most enjoyable job I ever had,
actually, was working here.

28:57.480 --> 29:02.110
Yeah. I managed this place
the summer I married Julie.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.716
- And look at it now. It's closing.
- I mean, John Wayne used to come here.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.949
- Gary Cooper.
- Yeah.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.829
This is the real deal, you know.
This is the last bit of old Newport.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.515
Look at it, all it needs
is just a little facelift.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.355
The land value alone would be enough
to secure a decent renovation loan.

29:18.520 --> 29:23.469
You know, you update the menu a little
bit, you bring back happy hour, it'd be...

29:23.640 --> 29:26.518
- It would be fun.
- The kids would come in. It'd be fantastic.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.750
I mean, a lot more fun
than whatever...

29:28.920 --> 29:31.718
...high-priced nuisance lawsuit
I got waiting for me on my desk.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.077
A lot more fun than moving
to Phoenix without my kids.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.111
What?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.474
Katie!

29:44.000 --> 29:45.558
Two more martinis, please.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.711
Egg McMuffins.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.348
- Sounds so good.
- Why can't they serve those all day?

29:50.520 --> 29:54.672
Totally. Like, what technological
innovation is preventing that?

29:54.840 --> 29:56.671
They can put a man
on the moon, correct?

29:56.840 --> 29:59.513
And they can't serve
an Egg McMuffin past 10:30 a.m.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.352
Can't figure it out.
It doesn't make sense.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.431
Cabbage Patch Kids.

30:03.600 --> 30:08.720
They still sell those? I don't get the legend
of the cabbage patch. It freaks me out.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.075
What? Babies harvested
from the heads of cabbage?

30:11.240 --> 30:13.071
- Exactly.
- What's so freaky about that?

30:13.240 --> 30:14.992
It's all about
some child-slavery ring.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.230
It's disgusting.
It makes me want to vomit.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.793
<i>Smurfs</i>, dude.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.394
Do you know how tall they were?
Three apples.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.835
- Really?
- Three apples.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.198
There should be a channel on television,
I think, of us watching television.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.475
- We're that good.
- Yeah.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.349
Yeah, you are. You're so that good.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.274
Your whole witty-banter thing
is so cute, you guys.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.273
You guys are like brother and sister.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.000
Yeah, you guys could totally
be related.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.628
I'm gonna go to bed.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.836
I'm going to bed too.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.511
Hey.

31:11.160 --> 31:15.676
- He's not back yet?
- No. And he still hasn't called.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.876
I'm really worried.
It's been two hours.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.591
- What's wrong with him, exactly?
- He's been battling depression for a while.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.754
And he's had some
substance-abuse problems.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.433
I'm sorry.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.354
I just hope he's okay.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.916
It's him.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.230
- Hey.
- Marissa...

31:41.400 --> 31:43.118
...something happened.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.838
What's wrong? What is it?

31:45.520 --> 31:48.353
- I messed up real bad.
- Where are you?

31:48.760 --> 31:51.558
- <i>What did you do?</i>
I just drove back to Newport...

31:51.720 --> 31:54.439
...and took a whole bunch of pills.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.635
Whole bunch.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.473
- Call an ambulance.
- No, no. No doctors.

31:58.640 --> 32:02.474
- Please. Just...
- I'm so scared right now.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.518
Maybe I could throw them up.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.398
Do that.
Just get them out of your system.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.556
I'll try.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.119
But...

32:11.280 --> 32:12.952
...do you think you could...

32:13.120 --> 32:14.473
...come back?

32:14.640 --> 32:17.359
I'm sorry, but I am so scared.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.029
Okay, we're leaving right now.
See you soon.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.033
- He's not okay.
- He just took a bunch of pills.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.678
- He's not picking up.
- It's okay. You just talked to him.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.159
That was 20 minutes ago.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.436
Hi. Marissa Cooper
for Oliver Trask, please.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.113
- I thought you said he was okay.
- He said he was.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.032
He said he spent the last hour
in the bathroom...

32:52.200 --> 32:54.634
...getting the pills
out of his system.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.836
- But if that's true...
- What?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.991
Why isn't he picking up?

33:36.680 --> 33:39.911
What the hell did you say to Dad?
I know you're behind this.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.796
Hailey, we had a conversation
and we both agreed...

33:43.960 --> 33:48.431
How convenient that the one thing you
two agree on is how to screw me over.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.429
- Hailey, you don't have to do this.
- I thought this is what you wanted.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.990
Me not taking Dad's money
or taking up room in your house.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.276
I never said that you couldn't stay.

33:58.440 --> 34:02.069
No. You said you wanted me to live my
own life, be on my own, be independent.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.800
Then you went and sabotaged
my relationship with Dad.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.668
What relationship with Dad? You take
his money and then you take off.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.594
My relationship with Dad
is between me and Dad.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.877
- Was between me and Dad.
- I just don't wanna see you in trouble.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.315
Well, now you won't have to.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.351
There's my cab.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.911
Oh, Hailey, where are you gonna go?
You don't have any money.

34:28.080 --> 34:31.993
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?
I'll find another way to get by.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.879
- You could stay here and work for Dad.
- Why?

34:35.040 --> 34:36.757
So I can be as independent as you are?

34:36.920 --> 34:40.514
Living off his money
in the McMansion he built you?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.272
I'm sorry...

34:43.440 --> 34:46.431
...but you were right.
I need to have my own life.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.831
And the only way that I can do that
is to get as far away from Dad...

34:50.000 --> 34:52.355
...and as far away from you as I can.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.953
I'll see you.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.678
Oliver. Open up, please.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.671
It's me.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.952
- We have to call security.
- I'll go.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.873
Oliver. Oh, my God. You're okay.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.996
Yeah, kind of.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.794
- You all right, man?
- Yeah. A little embarrassed.

35:21.960 --> 35:26.317
- When you didn't pick up the phone, l...
- I was in the shower. Sorry about that.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.916
I got kind of messed up,
but I'm good now.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.399
Yeah.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.630
You guys should go,
enjoy the rest of the weekend.

35:33.800 --> 35:38.237
What are you talking about?
We're not going anywhere.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.913
So, what did you take exactly?

35:43.080 --> 35:45.833
I don't know.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.834
A bunch of sleeping pills,
some painkillers.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.351
Well, how many?

35:52.520 --> 35:56.877
I don't remember. But I got them
all out of my system, I promise.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.715
Well, did you drink any water?
Because you're probably dehydrated.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.236
You know, we should call room service.
You want any ginger ale or Gatorade?

36:04.400 --> 36:06.868
Maybe we should take him
to the emergency room. I mean...

36:07.040 --> 36:09.076
...he swallowed all those pills.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.549
If they were in my system,
I'd have felt them by now.

36:11.720 --> 36:16.077
Yeah, but why take any chances?
We can take you now.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.153
The thing is, if we go
to the emergency room...

36:20.320 --> 36:23.118
...they'll put me under suicide watch
for 72 hours.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.590
They'll call the cops, and then
they'll call my parents in Zurich.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.069
I mean, the truth is that I'm fine.

36:29.240 --> 36:33.791
Really. I just want to just crawl into my
bed and forget this day ever happened.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.192
- Sandy.
- Hey, you're awake.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.032
Oh, shoot!

36:59.200 --> 37:02.317
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.595
Are you drunk?

37:04.720 --> 37:08.156
- Don't worry, I took a cab.
- Yeah, so did Hailey.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.880
Dad cut her off, and she cut me off.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.598
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.591
So how was your night?

37:14.760 --> 37:16.478
That good, huh?

37:16.640 --> 37:18.835
You know, I'm not sure, but...

37:20.160 --> 37:23.072
I think Jimmy and I might have
gone into business together tonight.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.039
Really?
And what kind of business is that?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.269
The restaurant business.

37:27.440 --> 37:31.149
- Oh, you are drunk.
- In an adorable way, I think. Yeah?

37:32.840 --> 37:36.469
- And what about the firm?
- They'll have my body.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.677
And so will you, by the way.

37:39.840 --> 37:44.197
But the restaurant will have
my soul and my income.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.397
- And my savings.
- How can you do that?

37:47.560 --> 37:49.755
Look, I'm making more money
than I ever made in my life...

37:49.920 --> 37:51.512
...and I'm having way less fun.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.274
I used to help people for a living,
you remember that.

37:56.120 --> 38:00.671
I'll tell you, your buddy Jimmy Cooper,
man, he needs some help.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.515
Oh, man, if he doesn't get a job,
he's gonna have to leave town.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.511
I don't want him to leave town.

38:06.680 --> 38:10.514
You know, it's been a long time
since I've had a friend in Newport.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.355
I don't want to have to find
another friend in Newport. Am I crazy?

38:16.960 --> 38:19.349
Oh, I'm crazy.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.637
You have to be crazy
to be in the restaurant business.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.950
But I think it's great
that you wanna help Jimmy.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.235
Well, you know...

38:27.400 --> 38:31.871
And be friends after all this time,
it means a lot to me.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.352
Sandy?

38:48.960 --> 38:51.269
They're sleeping.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.394
Hey, we're home.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.995
Thanks for the ride, buddy.
Great weekend, huh?

39:03.160 --> 39:04.639
- Bye, Summer.
- Bye.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.439
See you guys. Have fun. Drive safely.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.758
So you're into Cohen, huh?

39:12.920 --> 39:14.876
It must be kind of weird
to see him with somebody else.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.316
- It was for me with Marissa.
- Whatevs.

39:18.480 --> 39:22.109
I'm over it. Moving on.
Ready for my next victim.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.392
Well, just for the record...

39:24.560 --> 39:27.358
...whoever he turns out to be,
he's a lucky dude.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.080
You're looking pretty hot
these days, Summer.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.878
Real hot.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.072
Thanks.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.156
Oh, my God!

39:40.320 --> 39:44.313
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Luke. You're cute
and everything, but there's just no way.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.112
No worries.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.794
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?

40:03.960 --> 40:05.598
Nothing. Is he gonna be all right?

40:05.760 --> 40:08.149
Yeah. I think so.
I told him I'd stay tonight.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.751
- What?
- Well, I can't leave him alone.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.831
What if he tries it again?

40:13.000 --> 40:16.197
- Lf he tried it the first time.
- What?

40:16.720 --> 40:19.154
What if he didn't try
to kill himself tonight?

40:19.320 --> 40:21.231
- What?
- He wouldn't go to the hospital.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.119
Maybe he didn't want to be
shipped off to an institution.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.590
Maybe he belongs there.
I mean, what kind of person does this?

40:28.720 --> 40:31.473
- No, not... I didn't mean...
- You should go.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.552
- You weren't trying to kill yourself.
- Maybe Oliver wasn't either.

40:34.720 --> 40:38.554
But he's my friend,
and I can't leave him alone tonight.

40:38.720 --> 40:43.077
So, you know what, just go home,
and I'll see you in the morning.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.397
Sorry to interrupt.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.874
I just want to say thanks, Ryan.
For everything, man.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.674
Sorry for ruining your weekend.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.917
Good night.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.910
I'll call you tomorrow.

41:02.305 --> 41:08.508
