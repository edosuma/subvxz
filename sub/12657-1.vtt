Another village destroyed

01:34.807 --> 01:38.309
Let's go, soon, this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay

01:48.612 --> 01:51.364
1 ,000 years after the collapse
of industrial civilization,

01:51.490 --> 01:53.908
the Sea of Decay, a swamp
exuding toxic vapors,

01:54.034 --> 01:56.452
covered an earth strewn
with rusting ruins,

01:56.578 --> 01:57.954
threatening human survival

04:56.174 --> 04:58.009
An Ohm's tracks

05:05.559 --> 05:07.310
They're still fresh

05:23.994 --> 05:25.703
An Ohm's shell

05:37.257 --> 05:39.050
Amazing

05:39.593 --> 05:42.261
I've never seen a perfect shell

05:50.228 --> 05:52.605
Lovely sound

06:00.364 --> 06:02.281
It chipped my ceramic sword

06:02.407 --> 06:04.450
The villagers will be pleased

06:05.118 --> 06:08.746
They'll have plenty to
make into tools now

06:13.251 --> 06:15.252
What an eye

06:15.796 --> 06:18.047
I wonder if I can carry it

06:46.952 --> 06:48.494
It came free

06:49.579 --> 06:52.623
It's incredibly light

07:05.804 --> 07:08.514
Mushigo Palm spores

07:26.450 --> 07:28.033
So beautiful...

07:28.743 --> 07:31.704
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

07:31.830 --> 07:33.789
in 5 minutes without a mask

07:54.519 --> 07:55.728
Who is that?

08:04.529 --> 08:06.238
What can it be?

08:08.325 --> 08:10.159
My heart's pounding

08:12.537 --> 08:14.038
Those are gunshots

08:14.164 --> 08:15.915
An insect is
attacking someone

08:22.255 --> 08:23.714
Oh, I'm sorry!

08:40.398 --> 08:41.524
Over there!

08:41.857 --> 08:44.235
What a thick spore cloud

08:46.029 --> 08:46.779
An Ohm!

08:46.905 --> 08:48.572
That must have been its shell

08:52.577 --> 08:54.411
Don't run that way

09:01.962 --> 09:03.587
Look this way!

09:06.424 --> 09:08.592
They answered!
They're coming

09:41.793 --> 09:42.793
Who's that?

10:01.521 --> 10:03.606
What a magnificent Ohm

10:09.613 --> 10:10.487
Go upwind!

10:10.655 --> 10:11.822
Thank you!

10:14.326 --> 10:16.160
Return to the forest, Ohm

10:16.328 --> 10:19.121
This is not your world

10:19.706 --> 10:21.040
Be a good boy

10:23.501 --> 10:25.127
It's blinded by rage

10:25.253 --> 10:26.587
I've got to calm him

10:56.910 --> 10:59.870
The flares stunned it

11:01.039 --> 11:02.498
An insect charm

11:10.590 --> 11:12.466
Awaken, Ohm

11:12.592 --> 11:14.218
Return to the forest

11:24.896 --> 11:25.896
It's awake

11:44.708 --> 11:47.751
The Ohm's returning to the forest

11:47.877 --> 11:51.588
She tamed that Ohm with
flares and an insect charm

12:33.798 --> 12:34.798
Lord Yupa!

12:38.219 --> 12:39.803
Nausicaä
I hardly recognized you

12:39.971 --> 12:41.430
It's been a year and half

12:41.556 --> 12:42.806
Father will be glad

12:43.183 --> 12:44.641
I must thank you

12:44.809 --> 12:46.810
You've become a great wind-rider

12:47.103 --> 12:49.813
Oh, no, not according to father

12:51.775 --> 12:55.319
Oh, of course
I'd completely forgotten about him

12:58.740 --> 13:01.533
A fox-squirrel
I've never seen one

13:01.701 --> 13:05.287
When a winged insect snatched him,
I took him for a human child

13:05.413 --> 13:07.206
I had to fire my gun

13:07.332 --> 13:09.333
That's what enraged the Ohm

13:10.168 --> 13:13.128
He'd fainted so was
spared the poison

13:13.338 --> 13:16.882
Better not touch him
Even young, they're savage

13:17.008 --> 13:18.008
Come

13:18.301 --> 13:19.510
Here

13:20.011 --> 13:21.678
Hey...

13:23.556 --> 13:27.851
You're not scared

13:31.022 --> 13:32.898
See... you're not scared

13:36.027 --> 13:36.860
See...

13:45.411 --> 13:47.454
You were just frightened

13:52.794 --> 13:55.087
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

13:55.588 --> 13:57.089
Why certainly...

13:58.383 --> 13:59.508
Thank you

13:59.634 --> 14:02.344
Kai and Kui
Remember me?

14:03.388 --> 14:05.347
A mysterious power

14:06.558 --> 14:09.685
You must be tired
You ran so far

14:13.147 --> 14:15.232
Is everyone well?

14:18.027 --> 14:19.069
What's wrong?

14:20.238 --> 14:21.905
My father...

14:23.241 --> 14:25.075
He can no longer fly

14:25.410 --> 14:26.660
Jihl...

14:27.537 --> 14:30.080
The forest poisons?

14:30.665 --> 14:31.623
Yes

14:31.749 --> 14:34.543
He says it's fate for those
living by the Sea of Decay

14:35.795 --> 14:38.297
I should have come sooner

14:39.549 --> 14:40.757
Oh, no

14:42.051 --> 14:44.303
Thank you for coming

14:44.929 --> 14:48.765
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you

14:48.975 --> 14:50.809
My secret room

14:51.144 --> 14:53.770
It's a secret
I don't want to scare them

14:53.897 --> 14:55.939
I'll tell them you're coming

14:56.482 --> 14:58.275
Come soon!

14:59.444 --> 15:01.194
Lord Yupa

15:02.155 --> 15:04.323
Would you carry this?

15:04.449 --> 15:06.742
It's hard to fly with

15:17.670 --> 15:20.005
She certainly reads the wind well

15:20.131 --> 15:22.215
Not far now

15:57.835 --> 15:59.044
Oh...
Lord Yupa

15:59.170 --> 15:59.878
Welcome

16:00.004 --> 16:01.672
Are you in good health?

16:03.216 --> 16:06.677
The waters and winds
are clear and calm

16:07.261 --> 16:08.220
Lord Yupa

16:08.346 --> 16:10.681
Hello all, you're well

16:25.238 --> 16:27.197
Lord Yupa

16:29.117 --> 16:31.326
We've missed you

16:34.414 --> 16:36.415
Princess, he has come

16:36.541 --> 16:38.041
Wait

16:38.584 --> 16:39.751
Lord Yupa

16:40.586 --> 16:42.754
Old Mito, you're hard at work

16:43.089 --> 16:47.300
Tonight I'll hear
tales of your travels

16:48.261 --> 16:50.262
OK, start it

17:00.940 --> 17:02.107
Seems to work

17:02.233 --> 17:03.400
Yes

17:06.362 --> 17:08.780
This is excellent

17:08.906 --> 17:12.409
Tomorrow, we'll send
people to get the rest

17:12.702 --> 17:14.493
Come, Toeto

17:15.538 --> 17:18.540
Lord Yupa
This is Toeto's baby, born this year

17:18.665 --> 17:20.916
Oh, let's have a look

17:21.586 --> 17:23.252
A fine baby

17:23.378 --> 17:26.214
Reminds me of Nausicaä
as a baby

17:26.339 --> 17:29.259
Please be her godfather

17:29.385 --> 17:32.262
Name her that a fair wind
may favor her

17:33.056 --> 17:34.264
I will indeed

17:34.390 --> 17:36.475
I'll find her a fine name

17:37.018 --> 17:38.185
Thank you

17:38.311 --> 17:41.772
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess

17:42.190 --> 17:45.984
She's as strong as they come

17:46.110 --> 17:48.612
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay

17:48.863 --> 17:51.490
But that's where
I found the Ohm shell

17:51.824 --> 17:54.951
Put yourself in my shoes
I'm responsible for this castle

17:55.119 --> 17:57.788
She's made me sick with worry

17:58.831 --> 18:03.251
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells

18:03.377 --> 18:06.838
Indeed, her presence
there saved me

18:40.164 --> 18:43.041
Saved by the girl?

18:43.501 --> 18:47.546
This is a fine valley
Being here calms my spirits

18:47.880 --> 18:50.590
How was your journey?

18:51.676 --> 18:52.968
It was terrible

18:53.094 --> 18:56.555
The Sea of Decay consumed
2 more countries to the south

18:57.348 --> 19:00.100
It's spreading all the time

19:00.226 --> 19:03.311
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere

19:03.437 --> 19:05.564
Nothing but bad omens

19:06.065 --> 19:09.067
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

19:09.360 --> 19:14.239
The ocean winds protect our valley

19:14.365 --> 19:17.367
The Sea of Decay
can't reach us here

19:17.827 --> 19:19.119
What do you say, Yupa?

19:19.245 --> 19:22.789
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

19:23.416 --> 19:25.333
Look at my condition

19:25.459 --> 19:27.752
It would please everyone

19:28.379 --> 19:30.088
Don't bother

19:30.214 --> 19:35.302
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever

19:36.679 --> 19:38.388
Fate, huh...

19:38.931 --> 19:41.099
Obaba, what's
he searching for?

19:41.225 --> 19:45.353
Oh, my, don't you
know, Nausicaä?

19:45.479 --> 19:48.899
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

19:49.442 --> 19:51.526
I no longer see it

19:51.652 --> 19:55.447
The figure in the left corner

19:56.407 --> 20:00.577
"...clothed in blue robes,

20:00.703 --> 20:03.997
"descending onto a golden field,

20:04.123 --> 20:08.752
"to join bonds
with the great earth

20:09.253 --> 20:13.757
"and guide the people
to the pure land, at last"

20:14.133 --> 20:18.261
Lord Yupa, I always thought
that was only a legend

20:18.387 --> 20:21.097
You mustn't tease me, Obaba

20:21.224 --> 20:23.767
It's the same thing

20:24.310 --> 20:28.772
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries

20:29.190 --> 20:32.234
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

20:32.360 --> 20:35.445
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

20:35.571 --> 20:38.448
That is what I wish to know

20:51.671 --> 20:55.465
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

21:12.984 --> 21:15.485
Princess, Princess

21:16.112 --> 21:17.487
What is it, Mito?

21:17.613 --> 21:19.990
A strange scent on the wind

21:20.866 --> 21:22.993
It's nearly dawn
I'll be right there

21:30.668 --> 21:32.043
How is it?

21:32.169 --> 21:35.297
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss

21:53.941 --> 21:54.733
Over there!

21:55.484 --> 21:57.027
Look!

22:02.533 --> 22:03.575
It's a ship

22:03.701 --> 22:06.036
Why would a ship be here?

22:07.788 --> 22:09.122
What is it?

22:09.248 --> 22:10.540
Lord Yupa
It's a ship

22:10.750 --> 22:11.541
A ship!

22:11.667 --> 22:12.542
It's coming closer

22:18.799 --> 22:19.716
It's huge!

22:29.477 --> 22:30.935
It's a Tolmekian ship

22:31.062 --> 22:32.228
It's not flying right

22:33.230 --> 22:34.439
It's an emergency landing

22:34.565 --> 22:36.232
Help me up, Gol

22:37.026 --> 22:38.568
Princess, you mustn't!

22:38.694 --> 22:40.278
I'll guide them to the shore

22:43.949 --> 22:45.075
It's coming about

22:45.368 --> 22:46.868
Off you go!

22:47.953 --> 22:48.620
Teto!

23:17.316 --> 23:18.483
How dare they!

23:18.609 --> 23:20.985
They must have landed before
and killed some insects

23:23.280 --> 23:25.990
Turn away!
You'll crash!

23:26.742 --> 23:28.451
Turn away!

23:31.789 --> 23:33.748
Turn!

23:47.680 --> 23:48.596
It crashed

23:48.722 --> 23:49.639
The Princess

23:49.974 --> 23:50.932
The cliffs

23:51.058 --> 23:52.308
Let's go!

23:52.810 --> 23:54.561
Everyone to the rescue

23:54.687 --> 23:56.312
Even the boys!

24:21.380 --> 24:23.798
It's that girl, she's alive

24:43.235 --> 24:44.360
Where am I...

24:44.487 --> 24:46.571
The Valley of the Wind
Save your strength

25:01.295 --> 25:02.879
My name is...

25:04.590 --> 25:06.674
Lastel of Pejite

25:07.092 --> 25:09.260
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...

25:09.595 --> 25:10.803
The cargo...

25:10.930 --> 25:12.764
Please, burn it

25:12.890 --> 25:14.766
Your cargo, I understand

25:14.892 --> 25:16.768
Don't worry
It's all in flames

25:19.146 --> 25:20.772
Thank goodness

25:20.898 --> 25:22.482
Princess!

25:32.284 --> 25:35.578
That's...
The Princess of Pejite

25:46.674 --> 25:48.800
An insect!
An Ushiabu's alive

25:53.138 --> 25:55.139
Oh, no, it's calling its friends

25:55.266 --> 25:56.599
It can't fly

25:56.725 --> 25:57.433
Bring guns!

25:57.560 --> 26:00.103
No, if you shoot it,
it'll call others

26:00.437 --> 26:01.437
I'll kill it now

26:01.605 --> 26:03.356
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu

26:03.482 --> 26:04.732
Then what!

26:04.858 --> 26:06.150
Wait

26:06.277 --> 26:08.361
Mito
Bring my glider

26:10.030 --> 26:11.364
Princess!

26:27.423 --> 26:28.506
Return to the forest

26:28.632 --> 26:30.258
You're strong, you can fly

26:39.268 --> 26:40.768
That's a good boy

26:42.896 --> 26:43.563
Princess

26:43.689 --> 26:45.023
Thanks

27:07.755 --> 27:08.921
Thank God

27:09.048 --> 27:13.384
No telling how we'd suffer for
even a single insect's death

28:10.818 --> 28:12.402
An Ohm...

29:10.794 --> 29:12.795
Found one!
Come!

29:13.964 --> 29:15.047
Here!

29:16.300 --> 29:18.634
So those were spores
stuck to that ship

29:18.761 --> 29:20.678
They haven't released
any toxins yet

29:25.476 --> 29:26.726
We're almost done

29:26.852 --> 29:29.187
I know
We can't miss a single one

29:36.987 --> 29:39.071
What on earth is this?

29:39.198 --> 29:41.699
The fire didn't destroy it...

29:42.326 --> 29:44.952
Leave this mystery
for later, folks

29:45.078 --> 29:47.455
Go and help burn the spores

29:48.665 --> 29:50.500
Be careful, now

29:52.211 --> 29:54.337
Why'd she bring this
bundle of trouble here

29:54.463 --> 29:56.547
Mito, look here

30:02.596 --> 30:06.015
It's pulsing
Almost like it's alive

30:07.392 --> 30:09.018
Lord Yupa, what is this...

30:09.561 --> 30:12.730
On my journey
I heard ominous rumors...

30:12.856 --> 30:16.025
That a monster from the
old world that had slept

30:16.151 --> 30:17.735
beneath Pejite,
had been unearthed

30:18.529 --> 30:20.238
A monster from the old world?

30:20.781 --> 30:22.073
Giant Warriors...

30:22.199 --> 30:23.032
The Giant Warriors!

30:23.158 --> 30:26.828
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire

30:27.913 --> 30:29.247
This...

30:35.504 --> 30:39.549
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone

30:42.803 --> 30:47.265
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1 ,000 years

30:48.600 --> 30:52.270
In... In a way, the thing
looks almost human

30:52.646 --> 30:56.858
Tolmekia's a savage military state,
far to our west

30:57.067 --> 31:00.278
And remember the Pejite
captive who perished...

31:04.199 --> 31:05.783
Keep up the good work

31:16.545 --> 31:17.753
What's that?

31:40.736 --> 31:42.153
Tolmekian ships!

31:42.279 --> 31:43.613
Everyone to the castle!

31:51.747 --> 31:53.456
To the castle!

31:53.624 --> 31:55.708
Gather in the castle!

31:55.834 --> 31:57.126
The castle!

31:59.129 --> 32:00.463
Father!

32:11.141 --> 32:13.559
Obaba, hide yourself

32:13.685 --> 32:15.478
I'll stay right where I am

32:33.789 --> 32:35.247
Princess!

32:49.346 --> 32:50.513
How dare you!

33:14.538 --> 33:15.705
Nausicaä...

33:20.919 --> 33:22.169
Stay where you are!

33:22.879 --> 33:25.339
Move and this sword,
carved of insect shell

33:25.465 --> 33:28.175
will pierce your ceramic armor

33:28.677 --> 33:30.177
That's Yupa...

33:30.470 --> 33:32.596
I ask you Tolmekian warriors

33:32.723 --> 33:37.560
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships

33:38.020 --> 33:41.731
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest

33:41.898 --> 33:46.736
Is this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation, however weak!

33:46.862 --> 33:50.239
If you would make war,
you must have reasons

33:50.365 --> 33:53.701
You should first send a messenger
to declare them

33:57.456 --> 34:00.249
Nausicaä...
Be calm, Nausicaä

34:00.792 --> 34:04.253
If you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers

34:04.921 --> 34:07.757
We must survive
Wait for our chance

34:08.216 --> 34:10.134
You...

34:10.260 --> 34:11.594
Little wench

34:12.054 --> 34:13.304
Put it down, Kurotowa

34:13.597 --> 34:14.764
But...

34:17.601 --> 34:20.811
Look at this mess
Killed them all

34:21.730 --> 34:23.563
Your rebuke stings

34:24.190 --> 34:27.485
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

34:29.112 --> 34:31.280
We have not come for slaughter
We wish to talk

34:31.406 --> 34:33.491
Lay down your sword

35:13.657 --> 35:14.907
The Princess!

35:15.033 --> 35:16.367
Princess!

35:20.539 --> 35:21.872
Listen well!

35:21.998 --> 35:24.917
Her Highness Kushana, Division
Commander of the Tolmekian

35:25.043 --> 35:27.128
Frontier Forces will speak

35:27.712 --> 35:31.715
We have come to unify
the frontier nations

35:32.134 --> 35:35.177
and build peace in this region

35:36.096 --> 35:39.390
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay

35:40.183 --> 35:43.686
Accept our rule
and join our enterprise

35:44.271 --> 35:47.898
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the earth!

35:48.233 --> 35:49.275
Burn away the Sea of Decay

35:49.401 --> 35:50.901
Is that possible?

35:51.361 --> 35:54.613
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power

35:54.739 --> 35:58.200
that once allowed humans
to rule this earth

35:58.410 --> 36:00.119
For those who submit to us,

36:00.245 --> 36:04.540
I promise a life free from fear of
the toxins and insects of that swamp

36:08.712 --> 36:10.671
Wait!

36:14.134 --> 36:16.719
You must not harm the Sea of Decay

36:17.179 --> 36:18.762
What's that, you old hag

36:18.889 --> 36:20.389
Take her away

36:20.515 --> 36:21.724
Let her speak

36:23.059 --> 36:25.811
In the 1 ,000 years
of the Sea of Decay,

36:25.937 --> 36:30.566
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away

36:30.692 --> 36:34.987
Yet... each time herds
of Ohms, blind with rage,

36:35.113 --> 36:39.783
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave

36:48.793 --> 36:52.379
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities,

36:52.505 --> 36:55.883
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

36:56.009 --> 36:59.261
until they starved to death

36:59.596 --> 37:03.098
In time, the spores

37:03.225 --> 37:06.227
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh,

37:06.561 --> 37:10.564
and engulfed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay

37:10.899 --> 37:13.442
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay

37:13.568 --> 37:16.320
Enough!
No more of your ravings

37:16.446 --> 37:18.322
Ah! What will you do?

37:18.448 --> 37:20.449
Kill me, too?

37:21.243 --> 37:21.951
You!

37:22.327 --> 37:23.911
Kill me if you will!

37:24.037 --> 37:27.498
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman

37:27.624 --> 37:29.667
Just as you murdered Jihl

37:30.085 --> 37:31.043
Not Jihl!

37:31.169 --> 37:34.088
How cruel!
He was helpless!

37:38.134 --> 37:39.134
Shut them up!

37:39.261 --> 37:40.678
Show no mercy to impudence!

37:41.304 --> 37:42.596
Wait, everyone!

37:42.722 --> 37:44.473
Please listen to me

37:48.603 --> 37:50.938
I don't want anymore sacrifices

37:52.274 --> 37:53.440
Please

37:55.151 --> 37:55.985
Princess...

37:57.946 --> 37:59.822
You, too, Obaba

38:00.198 --> 38:02.491
We must submit to these people

38:18.300 --> 38:19.967
Step on it

38:30.979 --> 38:32.604
Hurry up

38:38.028 --> 38:39.987
It really is a lovely valley

38:40.113 --> 38:41.238
I'm against it

38:42.032 --> 38:45.534
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back at once

38:46.036 --> 38:48.037
An order we can't possibly fulfill

38:48.163 --> 38:52.124
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight

38:52.250 --> 38:55.544
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here...

38:55.754 --> 38:58.047
And what if I am?

38:58.214 --> 39:01.925
You expect me to hand over that
monster as a toy for those fools?

39:02.510 --> 39:04.803
You have a point...

39:04.929 --> 39:06.972
I am but a simple soldier

39:07.098 --> 39:09.224
Such a decision is beyond my position

39:09.476 --> 39:11.518
You're a sly fox

39:15.565 --> 39:19.401
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior

39:19.527 --> 39:20.235
Yes

39:21.071 --> 39:22.571
Can this gun ship fly?

39:22.697 --> 39:24.823
Yes, we found it here

39:26.076 --> 39:30.245
Get this straight
I'm not asking you

39:30.622 --> 39:33.290
But take the Princess to Pejite....

39:33.416 --> 39:35.876
5 hostages, the gun ship and food...

39:36.461 --> 39:38.003
You pick the hostages

39:38.129 --> 39:40.381
Prepare everything
for the morning

39:52.852 --> 39:54.186
Thanks for going as a hostage

39:54.312 --> 39:56.271
We're fine, but look

39:56.439 --> 39:58.774
They're taking everything in sight

39:59.609 --> 40:03.362
I will slip away, return in secret
and await my chance

40:03.488 --> 40:06.490
We must prevent that
monster's resurrection

40:06.616 --> 40:07.282
Yes

40:11.579 --> 40:12.788
Nausicaä

40:27.137 --> 40:30.180
Teto, where is she?

41:25.445 --> 41:28.363
Nausicaä! What on earth is this?

41:29.032 --> 41:31.158
These plants are from
the Sea of Decay

41:31.826 --> 41:34.828
I've grown them
from spores I collected

41:35.038 --> 41:37.164
Don't worry, they're not toxic

41:37.749 --> 41:39.875
Not toxic...

41:40.001 --> 41:43.045
The air here is pure indeed, but...

41:44.506 --> 41:48.050
Why... with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming

41:48.927 --> 41:51.470
The castle windmill draws

41:51.596 --> 41:54.056
water from deep within the earth

41:54.724 --> 41:57.768
The sand, too, comes from
the very bottom of the well

41:58.603 --> 42:00.395
With pure water and soil,

42:00.522 --> 42:03.565
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous

42:04.108 --> 42:06.151
The pollution lies in the earth itself

42:06.277 --> 42:08.779
Even the earth of our valley

42:09.405 --> 42:10.280
Why...

42:11.366 --> 42:15.202
Who made such a
terrible mess of the world?

42:15.912 --> 42:17.788
Did you do this all yourself?

42:18.915 --> 42:19.915
Yes

42:20.041 --> 42:22.626
To cure my father's illness
and that of others

42:23.086 --> 42:24.378
But...

42:26.798 --> 42:28.882
I'm closing it down

42:29.759 --> 42:33.762
I just shut off the water and
they'll soon wither and die

42:46.943 --> 42:48.610
Nausicaä

42:48.736 --> 42:51.446
I frighten myself

42:53.074 --> 42:56.451
I don't know what my rage
will make me do

42:57.245 --> 42:59.788
I don't want to kill anyone

43:30.820 --> 43:33.196
Princess

43:34.365 --> 43:35.574
We gathered these for you

43:35.700 --> 43:36.533
Chiko nuts

43:36.659 --> 43:38.452
They're for you

43:40.163 --> 43:41.663
All of you...

43:42.957 --> 43:44.333
So many

43:44.542 --> 43:46.126
You've worked so hard

43:48.212 --> 43:49.546
Thank you

43:50.048 --> 43:51.381
They're very precious

43:51.507 --> 43:52.674
It's not fair, Princess

43:53.134 --> 43:54.676
All aboard!
We're taking off

43:55.178 --> 43:56.762
There, now

43:57.013 --> 43:58.889
You mustn't cry

43:59.932 --> 44:02.184
Don't worry
I'll be home in no time

44:03.144 --> 44:04.186
Really?

44:05.021 --> 44:07.731
Why, have I ever lied to you?

44:07.857 --> 44:08.982
No

44:09.484 --> 44:10.525
Right?

44:10.652 --> 44:11.485
Yeah

44:12.070 --> 44:12.986
Promise?

44:13.655 --> 44:14.529
Yes

44:14.947 --> 44:16.198
Go along, it's dangerous

44:16.324 --> 44:17.616
OK

44:22.580 --> 44:23.747
You promised!

44:35.009 --> 44:37.344
Take care of the Princess!

45:28.312 --> 45:30.981
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

45:31.107 --> 45:33.275
My back is killing me

45:33.943 --> 45:38.613
Boy oh boy, did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers

45:39.782 --> 45:41.783
Hey, isn't this strange?

45:42.869 --> 45:45.203
Why do they fly so close together?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.790
Like they're afraid of an attack

46:04.140 --> 46:07.100
Toxins swirl below the clouds

46:17.069 --> 46:17.986
Don't move

46:21.532 --> 46:22.491
A gun ship!

46:32.710 --> 46:35.504
Enemy fire!
They've hit ship #2!

46:42.678 --> 46:44.054
I told you so

46:44.180 --> 46:46.056
Wow, terrifying!

46:50.937 --> 46:51.895
Defense formation!

46:52.021 --> 46:53.063
That's a Pejite gun ship

46:53.272 --> 46:54.022
Pejite!

47:06.702 --> 47:08.703
Damn! They got #3

47:08.871 --> 47:10.705
What's the Korvet doing?

47:11.833 --> 47:13.208
Their ships just crumble

47:21.676 --> 47:23.885
Oh no, he's hit our tail

47:29.267 --> 47:30.517
The Barge tether snapped

47:36.607 --> 47:37.899
Hurry, Teto

47:56.752 --> 47:58.587
Oh, no, we're going down

47:59.088 --> 47:59.921
Princess!

48:06.137 --> 48:08.221
Stop! No more killing!

48:17.982 --> 48:18.732
No more!

48:39.170 --> 48:40.462
Princess

48:48.971 --> 48:50.138
Hurry, Mito!

48:50.973 --> 48:52.974
Princess, we're doomed

48:58.814 --> 48:59.689
Maybe I can fly it

48:59.815 --> 49:00.857
Are you crazy!

49:02.902 --> 49:03.693
Hurry, Mito!

49:04.320 --> 49:05.695
What? Right!

49:07.073 --> 49:09.658
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!

49:18.167 --> 49:19.000
Come!

49:19.961 --> 49:21.169
Hurry

49:23.631 --> 49:25.215
Get inside
Mito, ready?

49:26.217 --> 49:27.217
Ready or not!

49:29.553 --> 49:31.513
Full throttle when we take off!

49:31.639 --> 49:32.222
Roger!

49:32.682 --> 49:33.515
Ready

49:33.683 --> 49:34.557
Go!

49:45.903 --> 49:47.278
Put on the toxin mask

49:47.405 --> 49:49.823
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge

50:01.252 --> 50:03.044
You're still warm
Don't give up, Teto

50:16.600 --> 50:18.476
What is this place!

50:18.602 --> 50:20.854
I've never seen
such dense toxins

50:21.397 --> 50:23.773
Keep an eye on the right tail

50:23.899 --> 50:24.774
It's nearby

50:25.818 --> 50:27.402
It's still aloft

50:28.738 --> 50:30.280
Hey! You're right!

50:30.656 --> 50:31.865
There it is!

50:45.296 --> 50:47.630
It's the Princess!
Princess!

50:48.049 --> 50:49.257
Don't give up, everyone

50:49.383 --> 50:50.383
I'll throw you a rope

50:51.093 --> 50:52.761
Our hook's broken

50:52.887 --> 50:54.888
You can't hook us in mid-air

50:55.431 --> 50:58.266
I don't want to crash and
become insect food!

50:58.392 --> 51:00.393
We'll leap to our deaths!

51:00.770 --> 51:03.897
Don't panic!
Ditch your cargo

51:04.023 --> 51:05.982
Good bye
Farewell!

51:06.108 --> 51:08.902
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!

51:09.111 --> 51:10.653
Kill the rear engine

51:10.780 --> 51:11.654
What?

51:11.781 --> 51:13.531
The engine noise is too loud
Hurry!

51:13.657 --> 51:14.491
Yes!

51:14.992 --> 51:16.034
What?

51:20.456 --> 51:22.957
Princess...
What are you...

51:25.503 --> 51:27.128
Your mask, Princess!

51:27.254 --> 51:28.505
You'll die!

51:28.631 --> 51:30.048
Put your mask on!

51:30.174 --> 51:31.841
I promise you'll be safe

51:31.967 --> 51:33.843
Trust me and dump that cargo

51:33.969 --> 51:35.345
We'll do whatever you say

51:35.471 --> 51:38.348
Please! Put your mask back on!

51:44.313 --> 51:46.064
The Princess is smiling

51:46.190 --> 51:47.315
We're going to be OK

51:47.441 --> 51:49.192
Hurry! Lose the cargo

51:49.485 --> 51:50.610
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

51:50.736 --> 51:53.613
Re-start engines!

51:53.864 --> 51:55.281
I inhaled

51:58.661 --> 52:00.245
Hurry, hurry

53:14.153 --> 53:15.486
Princess!

53:15.613 --> 53:17.113
Everyone safe?

53:17.656 --> 53:18.364
Don't move!

53:21.869 --> 53:23.203
You!

53:24.580 --> 53:25.705
Thanks for saving me

53:26.415 --> 53:28.708
Why'd you save her, Princess?

53:29.251 --> 53:30.585
You're a fool

53:30.711 --> 53:33.213
You thought I'd grovel
in gratitude?

53:34.590 --> 53:36.716
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay

53:38.969 --> 53:41.179
It isn't like the human world

53:41.305 --> 53:45.099
There's no knowing what
a single gunshot will bring

53:46.101 --> 53:48.811
That battle hurled
ships into this forest

53:48.938 --> 53:50.480
The insects are furious

53:50.606 --> 53:51.940
Look up

54:02.785 --> 54:04.661
The Yamma are sentries

54:04.787 --> 54:07.247
They'll quickly bring other insects

54:07.581 --> 54:10.166
We must escape now
Throw me your extra rope

54:10.793 --> 54:12.252
Mito, fix the hook

54:15.256 --> 54:17.465
Don't move
I give the orders

54:17.967 --> 54:19.884
What are you so afraid of?

54:20.010 --> 54:21.803
You're just like
a lost fox-squirrel

54:22.680 --> 54:23.680
How dare you!

54:24.181 --> 54:25.139
Don't be afraid

54:25.307 --> 54:28.977
We just want you to go back
to your own country

54:29.270 --> 54:30.687
You...

54:41.907 --> 54:42.615
They're here!

54:56.505 --> 54:58.631
Quiet! Don't anger them

55:00.134 --> 55:02.468
This is an Ohm's nest!

55:02.594 --> 55:04.637
We're surrounded

55:25.909 --> 55:27.618
They're examining us

55:29.496 --> 55:31.873
Forgive us, Ohm,

55:32.082 --> 55:34.375
for disturbing your nest

55:35.210 --> 55:38.379
Please understand,
we're not your enemies

55:59.193 --> 56:01.527
Princess!

57:10.556 --> 57:12.140
He's still alive

57:12.266 --> 57:14.016
Wait, Ohm!

57:28.282 --> 57:29.490
What's happening?

57:29.616 --> 57:31.617
Their eyes have turned blood-red

57:40.335 --> 57:43.129
What will you do with the glider?

57:43.589 --> 57:46.632
When the waters quiet,
take off and wait for me above

57:47.009 --> 57:49.552
If I'm not back in 1 hour,
return to the valley

57:49.678 --> 57:51.179
But...

57:51.346 --> 57:53.306
Princess!

58:08.864 --> 58:11.365
She's gone

58:12.242 --> 58:13.659
Hand it over

58:17.748 --> 58:19.373
All right, everyone

58:19.541 --> 58:22.460
We'll do as the Princess said

58:25.255 --> 58:26.923
Princess...

58:51.114 --> 58:52.740
Damn!

59:28.277 --> 59:29.318
Who are you?

59:29.444 --> 59:30.903
You think only of killing

59:31.196 --> 59:33.281
My flares and charms
won't help now

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.344
It's quicksand!

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:43.434
Damn!

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:10.086
It's been 2 hours already

01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:12.129
More and more insects

01:01:12.255 --> 01:01:18.552
Princess!

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:34.068
Nausicaä

01:01:36.279 --> 01:01:42.451
Come here

01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:45.746
Father

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:57.925
Mother's here, too

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:10.146
No, I don't want to go

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:14.316
Stay away!

01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:19.113
There's nothing here

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:21.115
I said, there's nothing!

01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.788
Stay inside

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.750
It's a baby Ohm

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:33.669
She's being used by the insects

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:36.672
Give it to me, Nausicaä

01:02:36.798 --> 01:02:39.508
No! It's not doing anything bad

01:02:39.634 --> 01:02:43.679
Insects and humans can't
live in the same world

01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:57.318
Please, don't kill it!

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:00.863
Please!

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.341
Teto...

01:04:21.736 --> 01:04:23.404
What a strange place

01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:28.951
Hey!

01:04:29.619 --> 01:04:31.453
I finally found it

01:04:31.913 --> 01:04:33.372
How are you feeling?

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:35.916
Where are we?

01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:38.627
First, let me thank you

01:04:38.753 --> 01:04:40.296
I'm Asbel of Pejite

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.590
Thank you for saving me

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.927
I'm Nausicaä of
the Valley of the Wind

01:04:47.804 --> 01:04:49.096
Where are we?

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.017
No wonder you're surprised

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:54.894
We're beneath the Sea of Decay

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:56.770
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

01:04:56.897 --> 01:04:58.939
Look, we fell from up there,

01:04:59.649 --> 01:05:00.941
along with the sand

01:05:03.653 --> 01:05:05.446
We're not wearing masks

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.283
That's right
The air here is pure

01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:10.910
Couldn't believe it myself,

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:14.204
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.129
What is it?

01:05:33.475 --> 01:05:36.393
Nausicaä, don't wander too far

01:05:57.666 --> 01:05:59.667
What a wonderful tree

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.851
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:55.055
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:07.026
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:26.587
Nausicaä

01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:33.093
Are you crying?

01:07:36.473 --> 01:07:38.932
Yes
I'm so happy

01:07:58.369 --> 01:08:01.246
Lastel was my twin sister

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.373
I should have been with her

01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:06.668
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:07.878
Oh, no...

01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:10.339
I'm sorry

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:14.176
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:19.430
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind

01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:28.941
This nut tastes really weird

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:32.361
It's a chiko nut
It's really good for you

01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:48.669
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:02.015
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:04.852
You think the strangest thoughts

01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:09.398
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse

01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:12.151
a world polluted by humans

01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:15.444
They absorb toxins from the earth,

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:19.366
generate pure crystals,
die and turn to sand

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:23.370
That's what created
these underground caverns

01:09:24.913 --> 01:09:27.749
The insects protect this forest

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:31.211
In that case, we're doomed

01:09:31.754 --> 01:09:33.589
We can't possibly survive,

01:09:33.715 --> 01:09:36.758
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years

01:09:38.344 --> 01:09:42.264
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:45.725
You sound just like Kushana

01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:49.897
No! We don't plan to use
the Giant Warriors!

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:51.732
You'll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow

01:09:52.567 --> 01:09:54.067
Let's go to sleep

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:57.487
We have far to go tomorrow

01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:22.596
All's well

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.100
On schedule?

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:29.603
The torso is solidifying well

01:10:53.127 --> 01:10:57.422
You're one cute monster

01:10:57.966 --> 01:10:59.925
Makes a poor soldier think

01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:02.928
of dusting off old ambitions

01:11:06.766 --> 01:11:08.850
It's grinning

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:12.813
You should've slept beneath
the earth 'til the end of time

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.273
Counselor!

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:18.151
Her Highness' planes were
attacked by Pejite survivors

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:20.279
All crashed, except the Korvet

01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:22.281
What about Her Highness?

01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:25.450
Her ship exploded in flight

01:11:27.954 --> 01:11:29.162
Counselor

01:11:30.498 --> 01:11:33.500
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No

01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:34.835
OK, we'll head out

01:11:34.961 --> 01:11:36.962
You stay here and keep working

01:11:44.637 --> 01:11:49.099
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

01:11:49.225 --> 01:11:51.643
Or it's a trap set to destroy me...

01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:02.446
Mito and the others have returned,

01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:04.531
waiting at Acid Lake, Lord Yupa

01:12:25.928 --> 01:12:28.555
In shame we return without her

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:30.932
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe

01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:36.897
Releasing me?

01:12:37.023 --> 01:12:39.691
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:42.569
and return to your country...

01:12:42.945 --> 01:12:44.988
Few of your soldiers remain here

01:12:45.114 --> 01:12:49.534
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.953
Fire and water are powerless against it,

01:12:52.246 --> 01:12:55.248
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:58.877
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back

01:12:59.587 --> 01:13:02.339
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:04.883
that another country had
harnessed its strength

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.969
Once its presence here is known,

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:11.348
the great powers will
send their armies

01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:15.894
You have but one choice left

01:13:16.437 --> 01:13:19.940
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers

01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.484
and learn to live with that thing

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.860
Look

01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:29.908
An insect did that...?

01:13:30.618 --> 01:13:34.329
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that

01:13:34.956 --> 01:13:37.082
Burn the Sea of Decay,
kill the insects,

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.626
and restore the human world
Why do you hesitate!

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:45.173
Steal it from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite

01:13:48.302 --> 01:13:51.138
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life

01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:53.974
Emergency!

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.642
What's the password?

01:13:55.768 --> 01:13:56.852
I'm in a hurry!

01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:57.769
Wind

01:13:57.895 --> 01:13:58.895
Valley!

01:13:59.021 --> 01:13:59.604
OK

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:01.106
Some spores survived!

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:02.524
What!

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:06.111
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.579
Hand 'em over

01:14:16.998 --> 01:14:17.998
Hurry up!

01:14:18.124 --> 01:14:20.208
Hurry, or the valley's doomed

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:23.170
We need our tools back

01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:27.132
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons

01:14:27.675 --> 01:14:31.136
We have no choice
Release everything but their guns

01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:33.096
The Korvet's taking off

01:14:33.222 --> 01:14:34.473
Get through this time

01:14:34.599 --> 01:14:38.643
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley

01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:42.647
Good grief, now
this is a real mess

01:14:43.691 --> 01:14:46.151
Hurry

01:14:48.529 --> 01:14:50.197
Find the Princess

01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:51.448
Look after the valley

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.783
Be careful until we return

01:14:59.207 --> 01:15:01.082
We're going to the valley

01:15:16.057 --> 01:15:18.725
It's no use, the spores
are already here

01:15:19.393 --> 01:15:20.727
And on this side, too

01:15:22.522 --> 01:15:23.396
Move!

01:15:23.564 --> 01:15:25.023
What are you doing!

01:15:26.275 --> 01:15:28.235
Oh, no, here, too

01:15:29.779 --> 01:15:31.238
Obaba

01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:34.074
We've no choice but to burn it

01:15:34.283 --> 01:15:36.243
This forest is doomed

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:41.248
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.543
Isn't there anything to be done?

01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:48.004
This forest guarded
the reservoir for 3 centuries

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.258
Damn! If only they'd never come

01:15:58.933 --> 01:16:01.434
This is getting out of hand

01:16:01.561 --> 01:16:03.019
Let's go help them

01:16:17.118 --> 01:16:18.451
You think so?

01:16:18.578 --> 01:16:21.121
I think it looks the same as ever

01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.291
The insects have gone

01:16:27.878 --> 01:16:31.047
I wonder why my heart's
pounding so hard

01:16:31.799 --> 01:16:32.841
We're almost there

01:16:33.259 --> 01:16:35.844
My friends are just
over that mountain

01:16:56.157 --> 01:16:57.407
Pejite looks strange

01:16:57.533 --> 01:16:58.992
What is that haze?

01:17:03.873 --> 01:17:05.165
Asbel, your mask

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:10.629
Insects! All dead

01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:12.380
Head for Pejite

01:17:12.506 --> 01:17:15.675
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there

01:18:07.853 --> 01:18:09.270
Even an Ohm...

01:18:09.397 --> 01:18:12.065
It attacked the Great Dome

01:18:23.035 --> 01:18:24.869
Pejite's finished

01:18:24.995 --> 01:18:27.831
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:31.126
They wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:35.588
It's a Brig

01:18:35.715 --> 01:18:38.299
My friends' ship!
They're landing, let's go!

01:18:50.479 --> 01:18:51.479
Asbel!

01:18:51.605 --> 01:18:52.772
You're alive!

01:18:53.441 --> 01:18:54.816
What have you done?

01:18:54.942 --> 01:18:56.276
We can't rebuild it

01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:58.319
You've seen the city

01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:01.281
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away

01:19:01.907 --> 01:19:04.117
But the Giant Warrior isn't here

01:19:04.243 --> 01:19:06.453
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind

01:19:06.579 --> 01:19:07.287
How did...

01:19:08.956 --> 01:19:10.915
We haven't exactly been idle

01:19:11.041 --> 01:19:13.001
We've launched our 2nd phase

01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:16.296
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight

01:19:16.422 --> 01:19:17.505
What!

01:19:18.007 --> 01:19:20.341
What are you going to do?

01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:22.010
Who's this, Asbel?

01:19:23.929 --> 01:19:25.972
Nausicaä from
the Valley of the Wind

01:19:26.223 --> 01:19:27.307
I owe her my life

01:19:27.892 --> 01:19:29.309
Valley of the Wind...

01:19:29.643 --> 01:19:31.311
Tell me, what will happen?

01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:38.401
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me

01:19:39.945 --> 01:19:41.362
They'll provoke an insect attack

01:19:43.282 --> 01:19:45.909
So you made them
attack Pejite, too!

01:19:49.747 --> 01:19:51.498
You're... horrible...

01:19:54.043 --> 01:19:58.463
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it

01:19:58.589 --> 01:20:00.465
We're doing it to save the world

01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:04.469
And so you'll murder
everyone in the Valley!

01:20:05.137 --> 01:20:07.680
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

01:20:07.848 --> 01:20:09.265
It's too late

01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.976
Once they've started,
no one can stop them

01:20:15.064 --> 01:20:18.691
We've lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians

01:20:19.151 --> 01:20:21.152
This is the only way

01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:31.162
Let go! Let me fly!

01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:39.254
It's horrible now, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.172
and rebuild the human world

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:44.092
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians

01:20:44.218 --> 01:20:46.594
No, they want to use it for destruction

01:20:47.513 --> 01:20:50.265
You drink water from the wells, too

01:20:50.391 --> 01:20:53.393
Do you know what purifies that water?

01:20:53.561 --> 01:20:56.938
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

01:20:57.064 --> 01:20:59.399
and rivers that humans polluted!

01:21:00.109 --> 01:21:02.110
And you want to destroy that!

01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:04.404
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior!

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:06.823
What choice do we have?

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:09.033
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

01:21:09.159 --> 01:21:10.410
Never, never!

01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:13.746
Tell them, Asbel, how
the Sea of Decay came to be

01:21:13.873 --> 01:21:15.623
How the insects protect this world!

01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:19.252
Please, Asbel!

01:21:20.212 --> 01:21:21.462
What are you doing!

01:21:21.589 --> 01:21:24.424
Don't move!
Release her

01:21:24.884 --> 01:21:26.676
Calm down, Asbel

01:21:27.344 --> 01:21:28.136
I'm serious

01:21:28.554 --> 01:21:29.721
Release her

01:21:30.598 --> 01:21:32.140
Nausicaä, go and warn them!

01:21:37.897 --> 01:21:38.938
Asbel

01:21:39.064 --> 01:21:39.772
Let me go!

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.848
Fools

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.063
No stopping fighting once it starts

01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:22.357
But he warned us to be careful...

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.944
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:28.363
Counselor! They got the last man!

01:22:29.156 --> 01:22:30.031
Coming our way?

01:22:30.157 --> 01:22:31.324
I don't know

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:33.409
The whole village is gathering

01:22:33.535 --> 01:22:37.330
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

01:22:37.456 --> 01:22:38.873
Just as it was with Pejite

01:22:49.426 --> 01:22:51.052
They got our tank!

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.055
Hurry, get it moving

01:22:54.181 --> 01:22:55.473
Don't panic

01:22:56.183 --> 01:22:58.476
Incoming fire!

01:22:58.936 --> 01:23:00.478
Forward!

01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:03.439
Hurry up!

01:23:03.565 --> 01:23:05.358
Maybe this is it?

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.486
It's moving!

01:23:08.612 --> 01:23:10.530
Which way?

01:23:16.662 --> 01:23:18.371
Forward, move forward

01:23:18.497 --> 01:23:19.998
I know that

01:23:30.342 --> 01:23:32.677
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks

01:23:36.557 --> 01:23:38.474
She survived...

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.685
So much for my dreams...

01:23:41.562 --> 01:23:42.395
Your Highness!

01:23:47.317 --> 01:23:48.776
We'll hold 'em off here

01:23:48.902 --> 01:23:51.654
Lead everyone to safety
by Acid Lake

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.281
All right

01:23:54.908 --> 01:23:58.369
It's just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship

01:24:01.957 --> 01:24:04.584
Hurry everyone!

01:24:05.294 --> 01:24:06.961
Stop gawking and help me

01:24:07.087 --> 01:24:08.421
My aching back

01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:12.425
The tanks are coming!

01:24:15.763 --> 01:24:16.763
Hurry!

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.639
I know that

01:24:34.782 --> 01:24:35.740
Are you sure?

01:24:35.866 --> 01:24:36.741
It's a Pejite Brig

01:24:37.284 --> 01:24:38.826
I saw it peeking through the clouds

01:24:38.952 --> 01:24:39.619
OK!

01:24:53.926 --> 01:24:56.594
Watch out, she's a wild one

01:25:03.894 --> 01:25:05.019
Quickly

01:25:07.147 --> 01:25:09.982
Nausicaä, you may go free

01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:11.192
Go warn your Valley

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.195
Your glider may get you
there in time

01:25:14.988 --> 01:25:16.364
It's waiting

01:25:17.783 --> 01:25:20.118
Asbel told me everything

01:25:20.244 --> 01:25:22.745
I'll take your place
Put this on

01:25:22.871 --> 01:25:23.704
You're...

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:26.207
Lastel's mother

01:25:28.961 --> 01:25:30.002
Thank you

01:25:31.338 --> 01:25:33.297
I'm so very sorry

01:25:33.715 --> 01:25:36.092
Everything we've done is wrong

01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:37.009
Hurry!

01:25:44.852 --> 01:25:45.643
What about her?

01:25:45.769 --> 01:25:47.687
She'll be all right, don't worry

01:25:53.777 --> 01:25:54.944
Be careful

01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:57.488
We've treated you so badly

01:25:57.614 --> 01:25:59.073
Over here, Nausicaä

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.450
Hurry

01:26:02.744 --> 01:26:04.704
Thank you, everyone!

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.000
Sorry it took so long

01:26:11.128 --> 01:26:12.378
Can you launch from here?

01:26:12.504 --> 01:26:13.671
I'll try

01:26:21.763 --> 01:26:22.597
A Korvet!

01:26:26.018 --> 01:26:28.603
Take cover in the clouds!

01:26:33.233 --> 01:26:34.859
Stop firing!

01:26:40.032 --> 01:26:43.075
Idiots! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there

01:26:48.457 --> 01:26:51.083
It's useless! I've lost control!

01:26:59.885 --> 01:27:01.093
The ship is breaking apart

01:27:01.762 --> 01:27:04.597
We have to leave
the clouds and fight

01:27:10.896 --> 01:27:12.230
They were expecting us

01:27:21.198 --> 01:27:22.448
What are they up to?

01:27:22.574 --> 01:27:24.575
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us

01:27:41.677 --> 01:27:44.220
Here they come
This is your last chance

01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:45.805
No, I'll stay with you

01:27:46.348 --> 01:27:47.765
I can't abandon all those people

01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:49.642
and the girl who took my place

01:27:50.602 --> 01:27:52.144
Only you can save your people

01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:55.773
Please, go, for our sakes!

01:28:07.119 --> 01:28:08.202
The ship is ours

01:28:08.328 --> 01:28:10.663
Take no prisoners
Destroy them

01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:17.211
Go, Nausicaä!

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.797
Asbel!

01:29:17.481 --> 01:29:19.690
Princess!

01:29:20.525 --> 01:29:21.192
Mito!

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.167
Mito! Lord Yupa!

01:29:38.502 --> 01:29:39.543
Princess

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.546
Hurry, everyone's in...!

01:29:42.964 --> 01:29:45.257
I'll engage the hook now

01:29:45.384 --> 01:29:47.551
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

01:29:53.767 --> 01:29:56.185
This is their last stronghold

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.567
The door won't hold

01:30:03.944 --> 01:30:07.780
Any time
Show them some Pejite pride

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:10.783
What is that?

01:30:11.827 --> 01:30:12.827
A bird?

01:30:13.495 --> 01:30:15.621
A ship, a gun ship from the Valley

01:30:15.747 --> 01:30:16.330
What!

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:27.091
You...

01:30:34.683 --> 01:30:37.476
It's Lord Yupa, here's
a chance for glory!

01:30:45.527 --> 01:30:48.571
Surrender, your Korvet
won't be back

01:30:48.697 --> 01:30:49.822
This guy's tough

01:30:54.661 --> 01:30:57.830
Princess, you're crazy
The engine'll blow

01:30:58.331 --> 01:31:00.833
Just make it to the Valley
Speed up!

01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:05.838
Dear God, God of the Wind

01:31:06.006 --> 01:31:07.840
Please protect my people

01:31:27.402 --> 01:31:30.112
They won't budge

01:31:30.238 --> 01:31:31.947
They're waiting for her return

01:31:32.073 --> 01:31:32.865
Return?

01:31:33.366 --> 01:31:36.577
They believe that girl will
return with their gun ship

01:31:36.703 --> 01:31:40.372
That gun ship's a pain
It's our chance to attack

01:31:40.999 --> 01:31:43.584
Do you know what that ship is?

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:46.504
It's from before
the Seven Days of Fire

01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:49.882
The one they say
went as far as the stars...

01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.760
It's too strong for our guns,

01:31:52.886 --> 01:31:54.762
but bury it in a hole...

01:31:54.888 --> 01:31:56.889
I, too, wish to wait

01:31:57.849 --> 01:32:01.101
If she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay...

01:32:02.562 --> 01:32:05.606
I'd like a chance
to really talk to her

01:32:09.277 --> 01:32:11.737
Made up your minds?

01:32:12.072 --> 01:32:14.865
If you'll aid our attack,
I'll let you go

01:32:16.076 --> 01:32:17.701
You want to end up like Pejite?

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.580
You're a Princess, too

01:32:21.706 --> 01:32:24.708
You're nothing like our Princess

01:32:24.834 --> 01:32:26.418
Look at my hand

01:32:27.254 --> 01:32:29.421
That's what King Jihl had

01:32:29.714 --> 01:32:33.425
In 6 more months
it will be stone

01:32:33.593 --> 01:32:35.886
But our Princess said,

01:32:36.012 --> 01:32:39.056
she liked these hands

01:32:39.766 --> 01:32:43.435
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker

01:32:43.979 --> 01:32:46.063
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay

01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:48.440
even as its toxins ravage you?

01:32:49.568 --> 01:32:54.154
You use fire
We use it a bit, too

01:32:54.281 --> 01:32:57.366
Too much fire
and nothing will grow

01:32:57.617 --> 01:33:00.619
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day

01:33:00.912 --> 01:33:04.540
Water and wind sustain
a forest for 1 00 years

01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:07.418
We like the water and the wind

01:33:07.544 --> 01:33:11.505
The sight of our forest
will grieve the Princess

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.801
Counselor, we await your orders

01:33:15.927 --> 01:33:16.802
Shut up

01:33:16.928 --> 01:33:17.928
Yes sir

01:33:22.142 --> 01:33:25.436
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute

01:33:25.979 --> 01:33:28.439
Let them go, Kurotowa!

01:33:28.815 --> 01:33:30.941
Huh? You want to wait?

01:33:31.318 --> 01:33:32.860
Feed the soldiers

01:33:32.986 --> 01:33:35.321
We attack in 1 hour

01:33:37.657 --> 01:33:41.452
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal

01:33:41.661 --> 01:33:43.454
Someone's coming!

01:33:45.332 --> 01:33:46.457
It's Gol and the others

01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:51.920
What is it?

01:33:52.714 --> 01:33:53.839
There's no wind

01:33:54.174 --> 01:33:55.507
No wind?

01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:59.845
You're right, the wind's stopped

01:34:01.222 --> 01:34:02.514
Obaba, what is it?

01:34:02.641 --> 01:34:03.849
Obaba

01:34:04.059 --> 01:34:08.854
Someone...
Someone take me outside...

01:34:15.737 --> 01:34:17.363
The wind's never stopped before

01:34:32.379 --> 01:34:34.713
Obaba, my ears hurt

01:34:35.048 --> 01:34:39.343
The air...
The very air is thick with rage

01:34:54.776 --> 01:34:55.776
We're close!

01:34:56.069 --> 01:34:59.029
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
3 minutes to Acid Lake!

01:34:59.406 --> 01:35:02.032
Idle the engines
Drop beneath the clouds

01:35:11.126 --> 01:35:13.043
What's this glow!

01:35:15.004 --> 01:35:16.046
Ohms!

01:35:34.107 --> 01:35:37.568
The Sea of Decay is spreading
They're headed for the Valley

01:35:38.153 --> 01:35:40.696
How did they stampede the Ohms...

01:35:46.619 --> 01:35:48.579
Someone's baiting them

01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:51.415
Mito! Turn towards Sirius

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.333
Yes!

01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.361
It's there

01:36:21.488 --> 01:36:22.946
Mito, a flare!

01:36:23.865 --> 01:36:24.907
Ready

01:36:26.326 --> 01:36:27.326
Fire!

01:36:32.916 --> 01:36:33.957
What is that?

01:36:46.054 --> 01:36:47.679
How cruel...

01:36:47.806 --> 01:36:50.557
They're baiting them
with a baby

01:36:50.683 --> 01:36:52.351
I'll shoot 'em down!

01:36:52.727 --> 01:36:53.894
No, Mito!

01:36:55.605 --> 01:36:58.065
Don't shoot!

01:37:02.821 --> 01:37:04.696
Why not! Why shouldn't I?

01:37:04.864 --> 01:37:07.407
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

01:37:07.826 --> 01:37:11.036
What can we do!
They'll destroy the Valley

01:37:11.496 --> 01:37:12.538
Calm down, Mito

01:37:12.705 --> 01:37:15.374
Return the baby to them
Let's try

01:37:23.341 --> 01:37:24.716
What are you doing, Princess!

01:37:25.093 --> 01:37:26.927
You go ahead and warn them

01:37:28.096 --> 01:37:29.221
Princess!

01:37:29.389 --> 01:37:30.889
You're not even armed

01:37:43.236 --> 01:37:44.903
That's not one of our flares

01:37:45.029 --> 01:37:45.612
How far?

01:37:45.738 --> 01:37:48.407
20 leagues
The other side of the lake

01:37:49.033 --> 01:37:50.409
Is it a gun ship?

01:37:50.577 --> 01:37:51.869
Probably

01:37:59.586 --> 01:38:01.295
That's a distress signal

01:38:01.421 --> 01:38:03.171
It's definitely the gun ship

01:38:03.631 --> 01:38:05.591
It's been an hour, let's go

01:38:05.717 --> 01:38:06.884
Why not wait?

01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:09.052
The bloodshed is inevitable

01:38:15.894 --> 01:38:18.020
Infantry advance

01:38:22.901 --> 01:38:24.151
Your Highness, get inside

01:38:24.277 --> 01:38:25.444
I'm fine here

01:38:32.243 --> 01:38:34.453
The gun ship!

01:38:37.123 --> 01:38:38.624
Fire!

01:38:48.134 --> 01:38:49.134
Hold your fire!

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.261
Stop it! Stop!

01:38:55.224 --> 01:38:56.141
Princess!

01:38:56.601 --> 01:38:59.311
Stand-by
Don't fire

01:38:59.938 --> 01:39:01.146
Your Highness

01:39:04.984 --> 01:39:05.901
Where's the girl!

01:39:06.027 --> 01:39:07.069
The Princess!

01:39:07.195 --> 01:39:08.779
She's not here

01:39:08.905 --> 01:39:11.198
The Ohm, a stampede
It's coming this way

01:39:11.324 --> 01:39:12.366
What!

01:39:12.492 --> 01:39:13.200
The Ohm!

01:39:13.785 --> 01:39:16.828
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them

01:39:17.288 --> 01:39:19.331
This is no time for battle

01:39:19.916 --> 01:39:23.168
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can! Now!

01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:29.216
Obaba, I see a red glow

01:39:32.178 --> 01:39:33.720
It's spreading

01:39:33.846 --> 01:39:35.305
It's coming this way

01:39:35.431 --> 01:39:38.892
You hold on tight

01:39:39.018 --> 01:39:42.813
There's no stopping them now

01:39:43.606 --> 01:39:45.065
Don't panic

01:39:46.484 --> 01:39:48.193
There's still time

01:39:48.987 --> 01:39:52.864
If I have to die,
I want to die in the Valley

01:39:52.991 --> 01:39:56.702
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the Princess has faith

01:39:57.286 --> 01:39:59.705
Listen, hold them off
as long as you can

01:39:59.831 --> 01:40:01.206
I'll return soon

01:40:01.582 --> 01:40:03.417
Your Highness, not that...

01:40:03.543 --> 01:40:04.418
It's not ready yet!

01:40:05.253 --> 01:40:07.421
If not now, when!

01:40:07.547 --> 01:40:08.839
Go!

01:40:13.803 --> 01:40:16.221
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

01:40:30.153 --> 01:40:32.070
Damn! She flies like a bird

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.323
She's not an enemy
She wants to say something

01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:37.909
Anyone who interferes is an enemy

01:40:38.244 --> 01:40:41.913
We'd better drop the bait in
the Valley soon, or die ourselves

01:40:45.376 --> 01:40:47.919
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire

01:41:01.225 --> 01:41:02.350
Now! Fire!

01:41:02.477 --> 01:41:03.268
No!

01:41:04.103 --> 01:41:05.062
That's Lastel!

01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:05.771
Move!

01:41:53.402 --> 01:41:54.736
Ohm...

01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:24.558
Don't be angry
Don't be frightened

01:42:24.684 --> 01:42:26.184
I'm not your foe

01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:30.063
I'm sorry

01:42:30.523 --> 01:42:33.775
I'm sorry
I can't ask your forgiveness

01:42:34.777 --> 01:42:36.528
It's too cruel

01:42:46.706 --> 01:42:49.374
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death

01:42:50.168 --> 01:42:52.210
Be good, little one, keep still

01:43:02.013 --> 01:43:03.346
They've found us

01:43:03.472 --> 01:43:04.931
They're coming

01:43:06.851 --> 01:43:09.227
Stop! Not with those wounds!

01:43:09.478 --> 01:43:11.563
The lake is poison...

01:43:46.557 --> 01:43:47.933
You...

01:44:15.836 --> 01:44:17.379
Good baby

01:44:17.505 --> 01:44:21.675
I'm fine
They're coming for you

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.183
They're turning away

01:44:31.727 --> 01:44:35.188
Ohm! Don't!
The Valley's that way

01:44:38.818 --> 01:44:41.152
They've forgotten us in their rage

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.154
If I don't calm them, the Valley...

01:44:57.128 --> 01:44:59.963
Fools! Drawing them
with their own fire

01:45:00.089 --> 01:45:01.089
We're safe

01:45:01.215 --> 01:45:03.675
We'd better get away
Check the engine

01:45:04.802 --> 01:45:06.386
No, no!

01:45:07.805 --> 01:45:09.639
We can discuss this

01:45:09.765 --> 01:45:11.516
Take us to them

01:45:11.642 --> 01:45:13.393
I must give them the baby

01:45:13.978 --> 01:45:15.937
What's the point, it's too late

01:45:16.063 --> 01:45:17.856
They'll never stop

01:45:20.526 --> 01:45:23.403
Drop us in front of them, then

01:45:23.529 --> 01:45:24.404
Take us

01:45:25.197 --> 01:45:26.906
But you'll die, too

01:45:35.875 --> 01:45:38.126
Obaba, will we all die?

01:45:39.003 --> 01:45:42.422
If that's our fate,
we must accept it

01:45:42.757 --> 01:45:44.382
They don't even waver

01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:45.091
Let's retreat

01:45:45.217 --> 01:45:48.428
Idiot! There's nowhere to go

01:45:53.017 --> 01:45:55.060
Don't retreat!

01:45:56.062 --> 01:45:57.562
Hold your ground
for Her Highness

01:45:58.064 --> 01:45:58.938
Highness...

01:45:59.065 --> 01:46:00.398
Your Highness!

01:46:30.513 --> 01:46:32.931
Get them!

01:46:33.057 --> 01:46:34.974
The Giant Warrior...
Giant Warrior

01:46:47.405 --> 01:46:49.906
It's rotting
It's too soon

01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:59.249
Burn them!

01:46:59.917 --> 01:47:01.126
What's wrong

01:47:01.252 --> 01:47:04.796
Are you not descended from
Earth's most evil tribe!

01:47:20.896 --> 01:47:24.566
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire

01:47:24.692 --> 01:47:27.152
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

01:47:38.831 --> 01:47:40.331
Destroy them!

01:47:40.791 --> 01:47:43.501
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:18.369
We're done for

01:48:22.082 --> 01:48:23.958
The Giant Warrior is dead

01:48:24.084 --> 01:48:26.252
It's for the best

01:48:26.378 --> 01:48:29.380
The Ohm's rage is
the fury of the Earth itself

01:48:30.382 --> 01:48:34.385
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster

01:48:38.224 --> 01:48:39.015
Princess!

01:48:39.141 --> 01:48:40.558
The Princess!

01:48:50.569 --> 01:48:52.237
Not there

01:48:52.363 --> 01:48:52.987
It's madness

01:48:53.113 --> 01:48:53.863
Princess!

01:50:05.185 --> 01:50:08.021
The Ohms are changing color

01:50:30.044 --> 01:50:32.337
Their rage has vanished

01:50:33.839 --> 01:50:36.341
They stopped
The Ohms stopped

01:50:54.151 --> 01:50:55.610
Princess!

01:51:03.369 --> 01:51:06.120
The Princess is dead

01:51:06.914 --> 01:51:11.417
She calmed them
with her own life

01:51:11.543 --> 01:51:14.754
She saved our Valley

01:52:14.773 --> 01:52:15.857
Look...

01:52:21.447 --> 01:52:23.531
What is that light?

01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:51.392
Teto...

01:53:07.493 --> 01:53:08.701
Wonderful

01:53:09.536 --> 01:53:11.579
Thank you, Ohm

01:53:12.164 --> 01:53:13.623
Thank you

01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:34.644
It's a miracle
A miracle

01:53:35.813 --> 01:53:39.899
Such friendship and sympathy

01:53:40.025 --> 01:53:43.236
The Ohms have opened their hearts

01:53:43.654 --> 01:53:47.365
Children, watch well and tell me

01:53:47.533 --> 01:53:49.283
what I cannot see

01:53:49.409 --> 01:53:52.662
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes

01:53:54.081 --> 01:53:57.250
It's like she's walking
through golden fields

01:54:06.343 --> 01:54:09.554
"...clothed in blue robes,

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:13.140
"descending onto a golden field..."

01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.686
Obaba...

01:54:16.812 --> 01:54:20.398
The ancient legend was true

01:54:21.441 --> 01:54:22.984
Look!

01:54:24.152 --> 01:54:25.486
The glider

01:54:25.737 --> 01:54:28.281
