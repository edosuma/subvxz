Drama, will you relax?

01:22.246 --> 01:24.212
Baby bro didn't
come home last night,

01:24.247 --> 01:26.981
and he's not answering his phone.
Don't tell me to relax.

01:27.015 --> 01:28.915
He probably stayed at Sasha's.

01:28.949 --> 01:30.549
No, more likely
he went on a bender

01:30.583 --> 01:32.350
and he's facedown
in a gutter somewhere,

01:32.384 --> 01:35.184
wondering why his friends and family
aren't searching for him right now.

01:35.219 --> 01:37.452
- Let's not be overly dramatic.
- Overly dramatic?

01:37.487 --> 01:39.520
Unless he's distributing,

01:39.554 --> 01:42.555
this is a large quantity
of cocaine he's holding.

01:42.589 --> 01:44.823
That is kind of
Tony Montana-style.

01:44.857 --> 01:47.591
Carlos, what I'm saying is I
think mark Cuban is reasonable

01:47.625 --> 01:50.425
so I think you need to apologize
for how you spoke to him.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.460
Hello?
He hung up on me.

01:52.461 --> 01:54.594
- Who cares?!
- What's he saying?

01:54.628 --> 01:57.429
He's saying he's gonna raise the money
to buy out he his brother himself.

01:57.463 --> 01:58.863
Then raise it!
How much does he need?

01:58.898 --> 02:01.465
- $20 million.
- You can start by selling this.

02:01.499 --> 02:04.399
Can we please focus on my
missing brother right now?

02:04.434 --> 02:06.834
- You still haven't reached him?
- Nope.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.970
Here you go,
bend your knees. We gonna do?

02:17.708 --> 02:19.575
Your movie star isn't showing, is he?

02:19.609 --> 02:22.511
Take it easy. It's 10:30 and he
was supposed to be here at 10:00.

02:22.545 --> 02:25.413
Something must have happened.
He's usually very responsible.

02:25.448 --> 02:27.415
- Did you remind him?
- Yes I did.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.284
You were there, honey,
last night sitting next to me.

02:29.318 --> 02:31.519
Right! I forgot after all
that happened.

02:31.554 --> 02:33.321
- Can we move pa that?
- No!

02:33.355 --> 02:35.023
Because everyone
is looking at me

02:35.057 --> 02:37.625
- don't even want to be here.
- You're here because of your son.

02:37.659 --> 02:40.494
And no one is looking at you...
except for that Siegel kid's

02:40.529 --> 02:43.030
who always looks at you
because he wanttoang you.

02:43.064 --> 02:45.965
- I am not comfortable, Ari.
- Neither am I.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.301
Some of these people saw you let
me walk out of that place alone.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.136
- You think I was wrong to? - You're supposed
to support your husband no matter what.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.337
Even if you're making a
complete jackass of yourself?

02:55.371 --> 02:57.771
- Especially then!
- I am very upset, Ari.

02:57.806 --> 03:00.305
- As am I.
- Do not push me!

03:00.306 --> 03:02.807
Ari, is this movie star of yours
going to show up or what?

03:02.842 --> 03:04.542
- 'Cause we need to get started.
- Yeah, John, he's...!

03:04.576 --> 03:07.276
- How are you, darling?
- I've been better, thank you, John.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.660
- Daddy, is Vince coming?
- We're working on that, buddy.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.180
Cause Parker Sieger doesn't believe
that I really know him.

03:12.215 --> 03:13.915
Parker, he knows him,
believe me, okay?

03:13.949 --> 03:15.716
Tell your dad to stop looking at my wife.

03:15.751 --> 03:18.050
- Yeah, Parker!
- Seriously, dad,

03:18.088 --> 03:19.552
my friends are gonna
be really pissed too.

03:19.587 --> 03:22.288
Okay, you have now officially
humiliated the entire family.

03:22.322 --> 03:24.824
- John, so nice to see you.
- So nice to see you, darling.

03:24.858 --> 03:27.226
You're looking great.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.260
Really.
She hates your guts.

03:29.294 --> 03:31.161
Uh-huh.

03:31.195 --> 03:33.362
I say call every hospital
in a 30-mile radius;

03:33.396 --> 03:35.764
maybe the police department,
file a missing person's report.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.633
He hasn't even been
missing 24 hours.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.634
That's what they said
about the Lindbergh baby!

03:39.669 --> 03:42.637
You gotta jump on a missing person
early or poof! You lose them forever.

03:42.671 --> 03:44.605
<i>- Morning, Jennie.
- Morning, E.</i>

03:44.640 --> 03:46.807
- Oh, hey, Jennie.
- Hey, Johnny.

03:46.842 --> 03:49.876
- What are you doing here? - Nothing.
What are you doing here?

03:49.911 --> 03:52.512
Um, I work here.

03:52.546 --> 03:54.680
- Yeah.
- Drama!

04:01.887 --> 04:04.087
You can't bang my assistant.

04:04.122 --> 04:06.123
Why, you don't think
I could get her?

04:06.157 --> 04:09.459
E, I know
we hate each other,

04:09.493 --> 04:11.427
- but this is about Vince.
- What about him?

04:11.461 --> 04:13.428
- I was gonna call you this morning.
- Speak, Scott!

04:13.463 --> 04:15.965
- Okay, I think that Vince
has a real problem. - Why?

04:15.999 --> 04:18.300
Because he showed up at my
house at 4:00 in the morning,

04:18.334 --> 04:20.101
wanting me to hang out,
looking for cocaine.

04:20.136 --> 04:23.404
- Oh God. - And when I said
no, he went fucking crazy.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.008
Jennie, you gotta find
Sasha Grey's number

04:27.042 --> 04:29.043
- and get her on the phone now.
- I'm on it.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.578
It's gonna be okay.
I'll call you as soon as I hear something.

04:31.612 --> 04:33.913
And please call me if you do.
Okay.

04:33.947 --> 04:35.848
Bye.

04:35.882 --> 04:38.583
- That was Vince's mom.
- She hasn't heard from him?

04:38.618 --> 04:40.452
Nope.
She's freaking out.

04:40.486 --> 04:42.821
So is my dad.
I just got off with him.

04:42.856 --> 04:45.690
- What's he freaking out about?
- He spoke to Carlos.

04:45.725 --> 04:48.494
- What'd he say?
- He was crying.

04:48.528 --> 04:50.563
- Carlos was?
- Yeah.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.631
Avion's been Carlos's
whole life, Turtle.

04:52.666 --> 04:54.099
It will kill him
if he loses it.

04:54.134 --> 04:56.101
- I know.
- So do something.

04:56.135 --> 04:58.202
Alex, I'm calling everybody
I know who has money.

04:58.236 --> 05:00.336
I know.

05:00.371 --> 05:03.039
That might be Vince.
Hello?

05:03.073 --> 05:05.775
<i>- - Yeah, who's this?
- Who's this? You called me.</i>

05:05.809 --> 05:07.443
This is Ryan Howard.
I was calling you back.

05:07.477 --> 05:09.611
Oh hey, Ryan, it's Turtle!

05:09.646 --> 05:11.713
I met you with Vinnie chase
at the world series last year.

05:11.747 --> 05:13.448
Oh yeah, I remember you.
You're the dude

05:13.482 --> 05:15.416
that was screaming out
and calling me a pussy.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.217
Aw, don't take that
personally, Ryan.

05:17.252 --> 05:19.987
You were playing the yanks. When you were
beating the Dodgers in the N.L.C.S.

05:20.021 --> 05:22.157
was there anyone screaming
louder for you than me?

05:22.191 --> 05:24.359
Yeah yeah, whatever, man.
What's up?

05:24.393 --> 05:26.494
You just signed
a $125-million contract

05:26.528 --> 05:29.497
and I'm sure you're looking for
ways to safely invest your money.

05:29.531 --> 05:31.765
- And you've got a way?
- Yeah... Tequila.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.967
No, man, I don't...
I don't think so.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.569
<i>- Don't you want to hear more about it?
- No, not really.</i>

05:37.604 --> 05:41.339
But, hey, tell Vinnie I said what's
up and to give me a call later.

05:41.373 --> 05:43.440
I gotta go to work.

05:43.475 --> 05:44.908
Okay, I'll keep trying.

05:44.942 --> 05:47.744
- And call me if you find Vince.
- I will.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.714
<i>Nice nice, beautiful.</i>

05:51.748 --> 05:53.815
Wiggle it a little for me, okay?
Okay okay.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.951
Okay, now make it pop for me,
right down the aisle,

05:55.985 --> 05:58.419
right down that middle Lane.
That's right, hot!

05:58.454 --> 06:00.521
Okay, now turn to left
a little bit... Yeah yeah.

06:00.556 --> 06:02.456
<i>Oh, the other left.
Right, nice. Okay, good.</i>

06:02.491 --> 06:04.125
Good.

06:04.159 --> 06:06.628
- Can we break for a minute?
- Yeah, just a minute.

06:09.898 --> 06:11.599
Look at you...
hot stuff.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.601
What happened to you
last night?

06:13.635 --> 06:15.135
C'mere, give me a kiss.

06:17.005 --> 06:19.171
- I woke up and you were gone.
- I had to go home.

06:19.206 --> 06:22.073
In the middle of the night?
I was worried.

06:22.107 --> 06:25.108
I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to wake you.
You had a big day today.

06:25.142 --> 06:28.076
- Why are you wearing the same clothes?
- I don't know, I'm lazy.

06:28.111 --> 06:31.278
- And freaking out.
- No. Why would I be?

06:31.313 --> 06:34.847
- This is just the box cover.
- I know, I'm here to be supportive.

06:34.882 --> 06:37.115
Which one is he?
The douchebag on the left?

06:37.150 --> 06:39.517
- Stop.
- No, really. I'm curious.

06:39.552 --> 06:42.653
- Which one do you think? - I have no idea.
Why don't you just tell me?

06:42.687 --> 06:45.121
- Better yet, introduce me.
- No.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.856
Come on, Sash, I'll be nice.

06:46.890 --> 06:49.291
Fine. Vince!

06:49.326 --> 06:52.628
- His name is Vince?
- Weird, I know.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.731
- Vince, this is Vince.
- What up?

06:55.766 --> 06:57.401
- Vince, big fan.
- Oh yeah?

06:57.435 --> 06:59.070
- Yeah.
- Too bad I can't say the same.

06:59.104 --> 07:01.606
- I haven't seen your work.
- That's too bad.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.176
Well, I've seen all of yours.
Even "Medellin."

07:05.210 --> 07:07.178
What, are you being
a fucking asshole?

07:07.212 --> 07:09.380
Okay.

07:09.414 --> 07:12.816
Huh?
What?

07:12.850 --> 07:15.752
John, I planned this party for six months.
I'm not canceling.

07:15.787 --> 07:18.388
I'm only suggesting you
postpone for a couple of weeks.

07:18.422 --> 07:21.291
- I... - Do you really want to put
your relationship on display

07:21.325 --> 07:23.192
when it's in this
very fragile state?

07:23.226 --> 07:25.461
It's not in a fragile state.
We had a fight, that's it.

07:25.495 --> 07:27.029
<i>- Any word from Vince?
- No, not yet.</i>

07:27.064 --> 07:29.299
- Jesus.
- Hello, John.

07:29.334 --> 07:31.168
Barbara.

07:31.202 --> 07:33.103
I assume you saw
"Perez Hilton" this morning.

07:33.138 --> 07:36.172
- - Your scene in Wolfgang's
got you a very nice headline.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.374
- You read "Perez Hilton"?
- My girlfriend's 23, I have to stay relevant.

07:39.409 --> 07:41.342
<i>The article also said</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:44.045
that while you were screaming
like a raving lunatic at Amanda,

07:44.079 --> 07:46.346
Vince and Sasha were
in the bathroom...

07:46.381 --> 07:47.914
- Fucking.
- What?

07:47.949 --> 07:50.183
This guy'll make anything up.

07:50.218 --> 07:52.051
I met my girlfriend
in that bathroom.

07:52.086 --> 07:55.054
- Now look, Ari...
- No.

07:55.088 --> 07:57.156
John, I am not gonna
cancel the party.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.291
- End of story.
- Maybe I'm not ming.

07:59.325 --> 08:02.294
- Why not? - The tension
between you two is palpable.

08:02.328 --> 08:05.496
I mean it was very very uncomfortable
at the baseball field.

08:05.531 --> 08:07.231
- For who?!
- For whom?

08:07.265 --> 08:09.600
- Oh Jesus, come on.
- For everyone, all right?

08:09.634 --> 08:12.235
And... I'm at a
crossroads with my lady.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.804
- What crossroads?
- Well, she wants to get married.

08:14.838 --> 08:17.440
John, you've been down
that road three times already.

08:17.474 --> 08:19.775
Yeah, but she wants a kid
while I'm still young.

08:19.809 --> 08:21.777
- You're nuts.
- Look, the point is

08:21.811 --> 08:23.778
we do not need any
tension around us, okay?

08:23.813 --> 08:26.447
There will be no tension.

08:26.481 --> 08:29.116
I think you ought to go home.
Go home why?

08:29.150 --> 08:33.087
Look, you do not want your wife
walking into a surprise party

08:33.121 --> 08:36.590
with all your best friends when the
only thought she has in her head

08:36.624 --> 08:38.926
is about killing you!

08:40.662 --> 08:42.395
Go home.
Go on.

08:44.198 --> 08:47.567
Yo, Drew, it's Turtle.
I met you at the super bowl with Vincent chase.

08:47.602 --> 08:50.370
Oh hey, Turtle. What's up, man?
How's Vince doing?

08:50.404 --> 08:52.539
<i>- Aw, he's doing.
- So what's going on?</i>

08:52.573 --> 08:55.742
- How would you like to invest in a
Tequila company? - Uh, I wouldn't.

08:55.777 --> 08:58.946
Even if I told you mark Cuban
wants to put 20 mill in real bad?

08:58.980 --> 09:02.282
Really? Now would I own it at the same
price as him?

09:02.316 --> 09:05.451
No, see, what I want to do is raise the money
myself and then kick Cuban out of this thing.

09:05.485 --> 09:07.286
<i>- Turtle.
- Yeah?</i>

09:07.320 --> 09:10.088
- - You were the guy
with the hat on backwards, right?

09:10.123 --> 09:13.224
- Yeah, probably. - Hey, man, phone's
breaking up. I can't hear you.

09:13.258 --> 09:16.327
- I hear you just fine.
- Hey, man, yeah, I'll hit you back. Sorry.

09:16.361 --> 09:18.262
Drew!
Hello?

09:23.067 --> 09:25.302
- The guy's a dick.
- You're the one being a dick.

09:25.336 --> 09:28.271
- Really?
- Look, he's just jealous.

09:28.305 --> 09:30.139
<i>Oh, he's jealous?</i>

09:30.174 --> 09:32.875
And tell me, what does
he have to be jealous of?

09:32.910 --> 09:34.944
<i>He's the one
fucking my girlfriend.</i>

09:34.978 --> 09:37.312
He's working and a movie star showed up?
He's nervous.

09:37.347 --> 09:40.316
Oh now he's nervous.
So which one is it... is he nervous or jealous?

09:40.350 --> 09:43.385
It's both. He knows I don't care
about him when we're fucking

09:43.419 --> 09:45.987
- but I do care about you.
- Bullshit.

09:46.022 --> 09:48.489
'Cause if you cared about me,
you wouldn't do this movie.

09:48.524 --> 09:50.825
- Vince, we've been over this.
- Let's go over it again!

09:50.859 --> 09:53.627
You do this movie, we're done.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.462
Fuck you.

09:58.366 --> 10:01.834
- Are you fucking serious?
- I told you don't fucking tell me what to do!

10:01.869 --> 10:03.869
Like I'm crazy for trying
to tell you not to do this?

10:03.903 --> 10:05.370
You knew what I did
when I met you.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.938
- Well, it's making me sick.
- Guys like you that go

10:07.973 --> 10:10.974
and fuck all sorts of girls just for the
fun of it usually make me sick too.

10:11.009 --> 10:14.243
But I made an exception.
I guess I fucked up.

10:14.277 --> 10:16.812
Go home, Vince.

10:18.481 --> 10:21.349
If I leave now,
I'm not coming back.

10:21.383 --> 10:23.351
Goodbye then.

10:26.855 --> 10:28.888
Sasha, calm down,
tell me what happened.

10:28.923 --> 10:31.357
He's such a fucking asshole.
I'm in the middle of work

10:31.392 --> 10:33.426
and he shows up and acts
like a fucking amateur.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.928
<i>- I'll talk to him.
- Don't bother, I'm done.</i>

10:35.962 --> 10:37.863
<i>- Do you know where he is?
- No clue.</i>

10:37.897 --> 10:39.731
He probably ran home
like he did last night.

10:39.766 --> 10:41.966
He didn't go home last night.
He went out looking for drugs.

10:42.001 --> 10:46.036
<i>- How bad is he, Sasha?
- Worse than I thought, I guess.</i>

10:46.070 --> 10:49.739
I'm sorry.
Call me and let me know he's okay.

10:49.773 --> 10:51.707
Okay.

10:51.742 --> 10:54.009
Drama!

10:54.043 --> 10:56.144
Drama!
Will you stop talking to her?

10:56.178 --> 10:59.080
- We weren't talking, we were looking at "Perez.
" - What's it say?

10:59.114 --> 11:00.915
Nothing good.
We need to talk to him.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.585
- I think he's heading back to the house.
- Good, let's go.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.386
- Hey, Scott!
- What are you calling him for?

11:05.421 --> 11:07.254
- We need to call everyone.
- What's up?

11:07.289 --> 11:09.556
- Come with us to Vince's.
- For what?

11:09.590 --> 11:12.291
We're gonna have
an intervention.

11:13.693 --> 11:15.827
You promised me you would
get her to the party.

11:15.861 --> 11:18.428
I know I did, Ari.
I feel so bad.

11:18.463 --> 11:21.197
<i>I just can't deal with all the
lying, given what's happening.</i>

11:21.231 --> 11:23.332
<i>Nothing is happening!</i>

11:23.366 --> 11:25.634
Don't believe everything.

11:25.668 --> 11:28.502
Ari, my husband is coming
out of rehab next week.

11:28.536 --> 11:31.504
I have enough of my own drama.
I can't take on yours.

11:31.539 --> 11:34.040
How am I supposed to get her
out of the house?

11:34.074 --> 11:36.308
I don't know.
I'm sorry, I just can't get involved.

11:36.343 --> 11:38.477
<i>- Marlo... - tell her I say
happy birthday!</i>

11:38.511 --> 11:41.613
<i>Fuck fuck...!</i>

11:46.351 --> 11:48.052
<i>âª Ohhhh. âª</i>

11:48.086 --> 11:49.887
Hello?

11:52.556 --> 11:54.991
<i>- Hello.</i>

11:55.025 --> 11:56.792
Baby, what's wrong?

11:56.827 --> 12:01.229
What's wrong? She married a
scumbag, that's what's wrong.

12:01.264 --> 12:03.631
Marci, what are you doing here?

12:03.666 --> 12:06.300
I flew in to comfort
my ailing sister.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.403
- She's not ailing.
- Yes I am, Ari.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.972
- I'm ailing badly!
- About what specifically right now?

12:13.007 --> 12:15.841
About the fact that
she married a scumbag!

12:15.876 --> 12:19.345
Marci, I'm having a conversation
with my wife. I'm sorry.

12:19.380 --> 12:22.748
<i>- Why are you at home?
- Because I want to spend the day with you.</i>

12:22.783 --> 12:24.283
She is not interested.

12:24.318 --> 12:26.152
Could you just shut
the fuck up and let...

12:26.186 --> 12:27.987
do not speak
to my sister like that!

12:28.021 --> 12:30.823
Okay, I don't want to speak to her at all.
I want to speak to you.

12:30.857 --> 12:32.725
So speak.

12:32.759 --> 12:36.295
I'm sorry about last night.
It'll never happen again.

12:36.329 --> 12:38.497
- Oh my God, bullshit!
- Listen, I swear to God, Marci,

12:38.531 --> 12:41.632
<i>- I will take a fucking frying pan...
- And call her a whore?</i>

12:41.667 --> 12:43.466
You're gonna bully
some more women?

12:43.500 --> 12:46.000
- I'm going upstairs.
- Baby...

12:46.034 --> 12:47.334
- go, just go.
- Hold on.

12:47.368 --> 12:49.269
Fuck you.

12:49.303 --> 12:51.704
Ken, please, can you just come
over here and hear me out

12:51.739 --> 12:53.939
<i>- one last time?
- Turtle, the deal's done.</i>

12:53.974 --> 12:56.942
We're gonna make Carlos a rich
man whether he likes it or not.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.842
How many yachts
can you waterski behind?

12:58.877 --> 13:01.410
Are you quoting "wall street"?

13:01.445 --> 13:03.511
<i>Greed is good, baby!</i>

13:03.546 --> 13:05.580
Mark, please, I can't come
chasing after you.

13:05.614 --> 13:08.782
- There's something going on with Vince.
- Is Vince okay?

13:08.817 --> 13:11.785
Hopefully he will be.
I can't talk about it over the phone.

13:11.819 --> 13:14.987
Okay, we'll come by. Can't wait to
hear what you have to say, Turtle.

13:15.022 --> 13:16.755
Thank you.

13:16.789 --> 13:19.624
Neither can I.

13:19.659 --> 13:21.660
There's no stress about
eating with your father.

13:21.694 --> 13:23.394
I don't know what you're
making such a big deal about.

13:23.429 --> 13:24.729
He is.
It's not me.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.331
<i>- How?
- He doesn't want me there.</i>

13:27.366 --> 13:30.434
<i>- What? Why? - I don't know.
He's being weird.</i>

13:30.468 --> 13:33.904
My guess is he's gonna grill you about
your plans for the bachelor party.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.472
Look, I'm not scared of your father.
He and I get along great.

13:36.507 --> 13:40.243
- We'll meet after for a drink.
- Uh, maybe you should have a drink before too.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.577
<i>- Maybe.
- Good luck with Vince.</i>

13:42.612 --> 13:45.380
Thanks. Meeting up with
Terrence for dinner.

13:45.414 --> 13:47.282
- Fun. - I heard he
was as big a slacker

13:47.316 --> 13:49.250
as our boss when he was
still in the business.

13:49.285 --> 13:50.852
I don't want to hear
about it, Scott.

13:50.886 --> 13:53.287
- You don't want to hear what?
- Anything about Murray from you.

13:53.321 --> 13:56.122
I need you here for Vince and if that's not
why you're here, then I'll call you a cab.

13:56.156 --> 13:58.157
I think you think you're
tougher than you actually are.

13:58.191 --> 14:01.392
I'm tougher than both you guys, so knock it off.
We're here for Vince.

14:01.427 --> 14:03.194
Let's do this.

14:04.696 --> 14:07.164
- Yo, Vince!
- Vince, you home?

14:07.198 --> 14:10.433
- He's not here. - Great.
Now what do we want to do?

14:10.468 --> 14:13.402
We wait.
E, you want to call Ari again?

14:13.437 --> 14:15.503
- Yeah, I'll call him.
- You found him?

14:15.538 --> 14:18.172
<i>- Yeah, we think he's heading home.
- Thank God.</i>

14:18.206 --> 14:20.774
- We need you here now.
- That cannot happen.

14:20.808 --> 14:22.575
Ari, we think Vince
has a drug problem.

14:22.610 --> 14:24.911
And if you're not here in a half
an hour, I promise you

14:24.945 --> 14:26.746
you're never gonna
see him again.

14:29.449 --> 14:33.351
- Marci, I am so sorry that
I yelled at you. - Pfft.

14:33.385 --> 14:36.687
- How about her?
- Have I ever asked anything of you?

14:36.722 --> 14:40.190
- - I have a favor
to ask you now, please.

14:40.224 --> 14:44.460
- Uh... no.
- Listen,

14:44.494 --> 14:49.231
I need you to get her out of the
house and keep her out until 7:30.

14:49.265 --> 14:52.433
Why, do you have hookers
coming over or something?

14:52.468 --> 14:54.668
Not everyone is like
your ex-husband.

14:54.703 --> 14:57.837
Oh yeah, that's right.
Because you just call women whores,

14:57.871 --> 15:00.005
you don't actually fuck them.

15:00.039 --> 15:01.539
Look, I have

15:01.574 --> 15:06.243
an incredible surprise party planned
for her 40th tonight, okay?

15:06.278 --> 15:09.146
I got the caterers coming
over here in less than an hour

15:09.181 --> 15:11.983
and I got Christina Aguilera

15:12.018 --> 15:14.352
singing her favorite song here.

15:14.386 --> 15:16.254
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:16.288 --> 15:18.690
That's weird, because I'm
just here by chance

15:18.724 --> 15:21.927
- and I didn't get a fucking invite!
- Shh!

15:21.961 --> 15:25.598
I'm sorry, but we didn't
think that you would come.

15:25.632 --> 15:27.400
You thought I would
miss a chance

15:27.434 --> 15:29.969
to just watch you throw
money at another problem?

15:30.003 --> 15:32.071
Look, I do what I do
and I'm pretty good at it.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.173
And I'd spend every
last dime that I have

15:34.207 --> 15:36.241
to show her how much
I care about her.

15:36.276 --> 15:39.311
She wants a husband.
She doesn't want a fucking party.

15:39.345 --> 15:42.279
- Ok... it's a grand gesture.
- You're an asshole.

15:44.115 --> 15:46.349
You have been struggling
ever since the divorce, right?

15:46.384 --> 15:48.852
Three kids and no help.

15:48.886 --> 15:51.587
Yes yes, you would think
that since their father

15:51.622 --> 15:55.056
fucked the music teacher I could
at least get free piano lessons.

15:55.091 --> 15:58.626
- Okay, I will clear your debts.
- What?

15:58.660 --> 16:01.228
You get her out of the house
and bring her back,

16:01.263 --> 16:02.830
I will clear your debts.

16:02.864 --> 16:05.198
I'll keep your kids in that
private school you love...

16:05.233 --> 16:08.101
even the not-so-quick one who
had to repeat the third grade.

16:08.135 --> 16:12.037
- Why?
- Because I love my wife.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.439
And because this night
is important to me

16:14.474 --> 16:17.574
and because your kids
are important to her.

16:20.577 --> 16:23.145
None of you watch
"intervention" on a&e?

16:23.179 --> 16:25.580
- - No.
- Phenomenal.

16:25.615 --> 16:28.182
What we need to do is
we need to sit Vince down

16:28.217 --> 16:30.818
and tell him how his behavior
has affected us.

16:30.852 --> 16:33.153
<i>- How it's affected us?
- Yeah.</i>

16:33.187 --> 16:35.322
Turtle, you go first.
You say, "Vince,

16:35.356 --> 16:37.691
your behavior has
affected me negatively

16:37.725 --> 16:40.494
in the following ways..."
Go ahead. Come on.

16:40.528 --> 16:43.432
Well, I didn't sleep last night, but
that was because you wouldn't let me.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.035
- Are you kidding me?
- Honestly.

16:45.069 --> 16:47.137
He's always been good to me
even when he's high.

16:47.171 --> 16:49.906
I'm really worried, but I don't have
anything negative to say about him.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.175
- Even if it's for his own good?
- Isn't there another way?

16:52.209 --> 16:54.310
- I'll talk to him privately.
- I tried that, Turtle.

16:54.345 --> 16:56.280
Exactly.
We all gotta come at him together.

16:56.314 --> 16:59.016
- Well, what if it doesn't work?
- It has to.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.288
Hey, yo, what are
you gonna say?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.329
You know, I got some business
to discuss with you too, E.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.698
- I know now is probably not the right time.
- Speak, Scott.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.567
- Okay, I'm taking Murray down.
- What?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.803
Yeah. Okay, I know that he
is your girl's godfather

17:18.838 --> 17:22.339
and I know that you think you like
him, but you do not. He is a wrap.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.407
- Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit.

17:24.442 --> 17:26.477
I got most
of the company with me.

17:26.511 --> 17:28.879
I was going to tell you...
in fact I tried to tell you,

17:28.913 --> 17:32.015
- but with your fiancee and our
tension... - Scott, listen to me.

17:32.049 --> 17:35.886
- That'll never happen.
- It is happening, Eric.

17:35.920 --> 17:39.555
<i>- - With or without you.
- Yo, baby bro's here!</i>

17:39.590 --> 17:50.266
- Come on.
- We'll see about that, Scott.

17:50.301 --> 17:52.435
- What's this?
- Got myself a present.

17:52.469 --> 17:55.672
- For what? - For being me and
for not having to answer to you.

17:55.706 --> 17:58.742
<i>- What are you guys doing here?
- We wanted to talk to you, bro.</i>

17:58.776 --> 18:01.044
About what?

18:06.150 --> 18:08.919
What the fuck is going on?

18:08.954 --> 18:11.421
This is all about
a bag of coke?

18:12.323 --> 18:14.591
It's a big bag, Vin.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.492
You guys are joking?

18:16.527 --> 18:19.095
I was having a party and
I called our weed guy

18:19.129 --> 18:20.763
and I said give me
a pound of both.

18:20.797 --> 18:23.398
I don't know how you order coke
'cause I don't really do it.

18:23.432 --> 18:26.767
- You're not that dumb.
- Are you kidding?

18:29.437 --> 18:31.137
No, wait... we can
sell that, bro.

18:31.171 --> 18:34.306
You know you forgot about my
son's little league game, right?

18:34.340 --> 18:35.874
Oh fuck.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.909
- I was up really late.
- Yeah, you kinda went crazy on me.

18:38.944 --> 18:40.878
<i>- Crazy?
- What, you don't remember?</i>

18:40.913 --> 18:43.648
No, I remember. I wanted to hang
out, but you were being a pussy.

18:43.682 --> 18:47.184
- I wouldn't exactly call that crazy.
- You kicked my truck.

18:47.218 --> 18:48.451
I did not.

18:48.486 --> 18:51.254
Vince, you know I came
out here for myself,

18:51.288 --> 18:53.623
but now I see there was maybe
a bigger purpose for my visit.

18:53.657 --> 18:58.026
The ex-addict who I
invited into my home

18:58.061 --> 19:00.829
<i>has come down from God
to save me?</i>

19:00.863 --> 19:03.931
From what?
Oh, let's see.

19:03.965 --> 19:05.766
I forgot to go to
your son's baseball game?

19:05.800 --> 19:08.602
I mean, why a movie
star has to show up

19:08.636 --> 19:11.703
to an eight-year-old's
baseball game is beyond me.

19:11.738 --> 19:14.039
But hey, I guess
that's Hollywood, right?

19:14.073 --> 19:17.708
Did I wake you up last night?
I'm so sorry.

19:17.743 --> 19:20.811
- And what did I ever do to you, Turtle?
- Nothing, Vin.

19:20.845 --> 19:23.980
- Or you, Johnny?
- Nothing.

19:24.014 --> 19:27.649
So why the fuck are you all here?
Oh wait, let me guess.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.217
E orchestrated it.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.587
E's worried about me.
E's always worried that his golden goose

19:33.621 --> 19:36.256
<i>- - is going to implode.
- Take it easy, Vince.</i>

19:36.290 --> 19:39.759
- It was my idea.
- That's really disappointing, Johnny.

19:39.793 --> 19:42.995
Because I'm fine.
I just had an argument with my girl

19:43.029 --> 19:45.030
and I'm a little upset, okay?
That's all!

19:45.064 --> 19:47.866
- I know, I talked to her.
- Really? And what did she say?

19:47.900 --> 19:49.501
She said you went crazy
on her too, Vince.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.636
- She doesn't want to speak
to you anymore. - Good!

19:51.671 --> 19:53.438
Because I don't really want
to speak to her either.

19:53.473 --> 19:55.574
- - Or any of you.
- Vine... Vince, come on.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.442
No, I'm serious.
I'm gonna go for a walk.

19:57.477 --> 20:01.043
And I know you all need me, but
I'll call you if I need any of you.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.747
Ahem, well,
Pete berg's office called

20:06.782 --> 20:09.283
and he needs to be at the studio
tomorrow for a camera test.

20:09.317 --> 20:11.885
So which one of you losers is going
to make sure that he gets there?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.820
You're the most powerful
agent in town, Ari.

20:13.854 --> 20:16.222
Why don't you make sure
he gets there?

20:22.294 --> 20:24.728
<i>- - How is she doing?
- She's a little better.</i>

20:24.763 --> 20:26.964
But she's... drunk.

20:26.998 --> 20:29.900
- Drunk? - Yeah, and she
wants to go to Vegas.

20:29.934 --> 20:32.035
Tomorrow she can go to Vegas.
Tonight I need her here.

20:32.070 --> 20:35.538
Marci, get off the phone.
You look like my douche of a husband.

20:35.573 --> 20:38.374
Okay.
I'm doing the best I can.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.909
Do better and I will put
your kids through college too.

20:40.944 --> 20:43.211
Bye, Ari.

20:45.748 --> 20:48.216
Johnny, I'm fine.
I got a room at the Roosevelt.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.585
Bro, I'm sorry.
It was all out of love.

20:50.619 --> 20:52.987
- Please come back.
- I just want to be alone right now.

20:53.021 --> 20:55.489
<i>- - I don't think you should be.</i>

20:55.523 --> 20:57.391
I'll call you if I need you.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.694
Hold on.

21:03.498 --> 21:04.931
<i>Room service.</i>

21:04.966 --> 21:07.667
Coming.

21:10.405 --> 21:11.938
<i>- - Hey, Mr. chase.</i>

21:11.973 --> 21:13.907
Hey.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.942
What the hell is up
with the music?

21:15.976 --> 21:18.044
Sorry about that, Mr. chase.
There's a party.

21:18.079 --> 21:20.080
- Oh yeah? Any good?
- It's Eminem's.

21:20.114 --> 21:22.982
- Can't imagine it isn't.
- Well, I'll probably head up there.

21:23.017 --> 21:25.085
- All right.
- See ya.

21:36.397 --> 21:38.798
I'm sorry I couldn't say
more and let's obviously

21:38.832 --> 21:40.566
keep the Vince stuff
on the d.L.

21:40.601 --> 21:43.202
Turtle, look, if Vince is going
to be the face of Avion,

21:43.237 --> 21:45.804
then obviously we don't want
to hurt his name either.

21:45.839 --> 21:49.007
No disrespect, but you guys
are hurting everybody.

21:49.042 --> 21:53.178
This Tequila is authentic because
as corny as it may sound

21:53.212 --> 21:55.714
- it's made with love.
- That's corny as shit.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.049
Maybe it is, but you know what?
Carlos makes a great product

21:58.084 --> 21:59.784
and without him,
we're just another brand.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.053
- I think he likes Carlos.
- I think he loves him.

22:02.087 --> 22:04.956
I don't know if I like Carlos or
not, but I think we need him.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.792
I think we could use him.
He's a personality. And to be honest,

22:07.826 --> 22:09.561
he'll sell the product
better than Vince will.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.430
Like Juan Valdez
did for coffee.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.631
Like aunt Jemima did for syrup.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.066
Like that "where's
the beef?" Lady did

22:14.100 --> 22:15.600
for whatever the fuck
she was selling.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.634
The only difference is
Carlos is the real deal.

22:17.668 --> 22:19.168
- Juan Valdez.
- Aunt Jemima?

22:19.203 --> 22:21.137
Turtle, this is about
your girl, right?

22:21.171 --> 22:23.073
This is gonna kill me
with her, mark, yeah.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.975
That's a shame,
because she's a keeper.

22:25.009 --> 22:26.810
- She's too good for him.
- Thanks, Ken.

22:26.844 --> 22:29.010
Look, Turtle, I like you.

22:29.044 --> 22:31.244
I hate Carlos, but I like you.

22:31.278 --> 22:34.747
So I'm gonna give Carlos his $5
million to build his factory,

22:34.782 --> 22:37.650
no strings attached.
And if he hits his numbers

22:37.684 --> 22:40.486
there'll be more money
behind that.

22:40.520 --> 22:44.188
But if you fuck me, you know
what's going to happen?

22:44.223 --> 22:48.225
Mark's gonna make Gordon Gekko
look like Mary Poppins.

22:49.694 --> 22:51.461
I will never forget this.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.530
Neither will I, Turtle.

22:54.465 --> 22:56.732
You're not nervous, are you?

22:56.767 --> 22:58.467
No, why?
Do I seem nervous?

22:58.501 --> 23:01.036
Yes.
A little bit.

23:01.070 --> 23:02.937
I had a rough day
at the office.

23:02.972 --> 23:04.939
It's the last thing
you need, isn't it,

23:04.974 --> 23:07.341
for your star client
to be strung out on drugs?

23:07.376 --> 23:10.244
Sloan told you about that?

23:10.278 --> 23:12.879
Yeah well, he's actually
my best friend too,

23:12.914 --> 23:15.248
so I'm really more concerned
on a personal level.

23:15.282 --> 23:18.551
Of course. Well listen, I've
been speaking to your boss.

23:18.585 --> 23:20.486
- Who, Murray?
- Mm-hmm.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.422
He tells me that you're quite
an asset to the company.

23:23.456 --> 23:25.557
- Oh, I appreciate that.
- Yeah! Listen.

23:25.591 --> 23:27.692
You've signed a few clients,

23:27.726 --> 23:30.127
Vince's brother, for instance.

23:30.161 --> 23:32.896
Yeah, we got him a cartoon set up.
It should be pretty big.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.431
Looking beyond your friends,

23:35.466 --> 23:37.833
do you see any growth here?

23:37.868 --> 23:41.069
- Yeah, I've signed a lot of good clients this year.
- Murray's worried about you.

23:41.104 --> 23:44.472
He... he's not sure quite how
to keep you motivated.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.307
- He said that?
- Mmm.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.175
- Murray's never even there, Terrance.
- He's worried about you, Eric,

23:49.210 --> 23:52.511
- as am I.
- What are you worried about?

23:52.545 --> 23:54.179
My daughter.

23:54.213 --> 23:56.581
Aside from the fact
that she's blessed

23:56.615 --> 23:58.716
by my credible gene pool,

23:58.750 --> 24:01.254
she's also blessed

24:01.288 --> 24:03.256
with an awful lot of my money.

24:03.291 --> 24:06.326
- Right?
- Well, I'd hate for that money

24:06.361 --> 24:09.996
to give you any less incentive
to really work hard.

24:10.030 --> 24:12.498
Terrence, listen, I'm not
interested in Sloan's money.

24:12.533 --> 24:14.434
- I make my own.
- This is great!

24:14.468 --> 24:17.203
- It's gonna be easy.
- What's gonna be easy?

24:17.237 --> 24:19.873
I'd like you to sign a prenup.

24:23.944 --> 24:26.078
Everything looks nice, right?
It looks nice.

24:26.112 --> 24:28.046
Ari, relax.
It's smashing.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.413
Thank you.

24:30.915 --> 24:32.115
- Babe?
- Mm-hmm?

24:32.149 --> 24:34.384
- Is there any absinthe?
- I don't know. Ari?

24:34.418 --> 24:36.952
Uh, I will ask the bartender.

24:36.986 --> 24:39.954
And when is this party
starting?

24:39.988 --> 24:42.323
- Ari?
- Uh, any minute.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.458
Any minute.

24:46.928 --> 24:48.895
You're... you're really
gonna marry her?

24:48.929 --> 24:51.163
She's terrific.
The tension's getting to her.

24:51.197 --> 24:53.365
The tension is getting to her?
What tension?

24:53.399 --> 24:56.434
Oh, the... "Where's the guest
of honor" tension, that one.

24:56.469 --> 24:58.269
- Any minute, okay?
- Are you sure?

24:58.303 --> 25:00.004
- Believe me I am sure.
- Ari?

25:00.038 --> 25:01.873
- She's here.
- She's here, okay.

25:01.907 --> 25:03.407
Places, everyone, places.

25:03.442 --> 25:05.442
As soon as we yell surprise,
you start singing "beautiful."

25:05.477 --> 25:07.044
- Got it.
- All right.

25:07.078 --> 25:10.446
Is there any way I could get
you to listen to my demo?

25:10.481 --> 25:12.949
Uh, let's wait till after
the surprise, okay?

25:21.023 --> 25:23.557
Surprise!

25:23.591 --> 25:25.559
Where is she?

25:25.593 --> 25:27.427
Can I talk to you in private?

25:32.466 --> 25:35.067
Ari, it's 9:15.
You asked me to do an hour.

25:35.102 --> 25:36.802
Please play longer.
I can't pay your fee,

25:36.837 --> 25:38.237
but I'll give you
the deed to my house.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.705
That's still not going to cover it.
I want your Lakers seats

25:40.740 --> 25:42.941
- for the playoffs... all of them.
- Done.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.176
You give me a Grammy-worthy
performance and I'll get

25:45.210 --> 25:46.978
Kobe Bryant to sing
at your birthday.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.946
Uh-huh.
I'll believe it when I see it.

25:52.618 --> 25:54.652
- What's going on?
- She's not coming.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.888
- I had to tell her.
- What, why?

25:56.922 --> 25:58.923
Because she was coming here
to talk to you

25:58.957 --> 26:01.025
and I didn't want her
walking into an ambush.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.727
This is a sign of love.
This isn't an ambush.

26:03.762 --> 26:07.530
<i>- - I'm sure that's her.</i>

26:07.565 --> 26:10.199
I'm gonna get
some of her things.

26:17.443 --> 26:20.078
<i>- - Baby, where are you?</i>

26:20.112 --> 26:22.213
I am so sorry, Ari.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.715
<i>Honey, I'm sorry.
Just please</i>

26:24.750 --> 26:26.317
come home.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.187
I can't face all those people.

26:28.221 --> 26:31.191
I will clear them all out.

26:31.226 --> 26:34.027
It will just be you and me.
Please, talk to me.

26:34.061 --> 26:36.229
I need a break, Ari.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.966
A break?
From what?

26:42.236 --> 26:44.337
<i>I need some space.</i>

26:44.371 --> 26:47.840
I'm going to pick up the kids at
Stacy's and go to my mother's.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.610
Baby... baby, please.

26:50.644 --> 26:53.646
âª The love is gone âª

26:56.483 --> 27:00.853
âª and we had magic âª

27:00.888 --> 27:05.124
<i>âª and this is tragic... âª</i>

27:06.260 --> 27:07.827
<i>âª I'm the boss âª</i>

27:07.862 --> 27:09.829
<i>âª I just want to get
that across âª</i>

27:09.864 --> 27:11.631
<i>âª man, even my dentist
hates when I floss âª</i>

27:11.665 --> 27:13.866
<i>âª pull up to the club in
a pinto like it's a Porsche âª</i>

27:13.901 --> 27:16.402
<i>âª garbage bag for one of the
windows, spray-painted doors âª</i>

27:16.436 --> 27:18.371
<i>âª with the flames on them,
Michigan plates... âª</i>

27:18.405 --> 27:20.239
You're so hot.

27:20.274 --> 27:22.375
We haven't fucked before,
have we?

27:22.409 --> 27:24.210
No, not yet.

27:24.244 --> 27:26.646
Well, pencil me in for later.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.347
I'll be right back.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.251
Minka?
Hey, Minka.

27:32.285 --> 27:34.287
- Vincent chase.
- Okay.

27:34.321 --> 27:36.088
I'm doing a movie
with Pete berg

27:36.123 --> 27:38.557
and once upon a time
he said we should meet.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.159
- Okay.
- And here we are meeting.

27:40.193 --> 27:41.760
Nice to meet you.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.698
- Excuse me, have you seen Vincent chase?
- Yeah, he's around.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.403
Where you at, bro?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.839
- Yeah, I'd love to, but I have a boyfriend.
- I have a girlfriend

27:53.873 --> 27:56.374
but she fucks other dudes...
lots of them.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.443
So I figure I can
fuck other girls.

27:58.478 --> 28:00.045
I thought we were
gonna fuck tonight.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.547
Oh perfect...
we can all fuck.

28:01.581 --> 28:03.715
You know what?
Why don't you fuck yourself?

28:03.750 --> 28:06.819
Aw whoa, you don't have
to be a bitch about it.

28:08.022 --> 28:09.956
Yo, bro, you okay?

28:09.990 --> 28:12.658
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You don't look it.

28:12.693 --> 28:15.894
Hey, Johnny, do you want to party or
do you want to be a bitch-ass pussy?

28:15.929 --> 28:17.529
- Come on, Vince, let's go.
- No no no!

28:17.563 --> 28:19.698
Mr. chase, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.899
- We were just leaving.
Come on, bro. - No no.

28:21.934 --> 28:25.403
No we weren't. I'm sorry,
wh... what did I do?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.006
- We've had some complaints.
- I'm a guest in the hotel.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.842
- And this is a private party.
- I'm friends with the band.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.977
- So why don't you go fuck yourself?
- Yo, Vince.

28:33.011 --> 28:34.912
Vince, what up, man?
What's the deal?

28:34.947 --> 28:37.249
What's up?
You tell this guy I'm cool to stay.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.817
No, I don't think he's so cool.

28:38.852 --> 28:40.753
Oh, look who it is...
Minka the tight-ass.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.654
- Fuck you, Vince.
- Fuck you.

28:42.689 --> 28:44.456
- Yo, chill out, Vince.
- Fuck you too.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.992
Fuck me? Yo, get this dude out
of here before I fuck him up.

28:47.026 --> 28:50.295
Wow, what, are you too mainstream now
to fight your own fights, Marshall?

28:54.033 --> 28:56.302
What the fuck's
wrong th you, man?

28:59.005 --> 29:00.372
Fucking punk!

29:03.944 --> 29:05.344
Vince, Vince!

29:05.378 --> 29:07.880
Vince! Stop!

29:07.914 --> 29:10.583
<i>- - You honestly didn't know
- No</i>

29:10.617 --> 29:13.752
<i>- and I can't believe you would think that.
- I don't know what to think.</i>

29:13.786 --> 29:16.822
- And why did you tell him Vince was on drugs?
- He's my father!

29:16.856 --> 29:18.957
<i>- Yet he didn't tell you this?
- Eric.</i>

29:18.991 --> 29:21.959
Sloan, he treated me like I'm some slacker.
Like either of them should talk.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.361
They both built their businesses
on other people's hard work.

29:24.395 --> 29:27.564
You're upset. Let's talk about
this when you get home.

29:27.598 --> 29:29.498
Okay.

29:34.103 --> 29:35.770
Yo, Scott, it's Eric.

29:35.804 --> 29:37.638
Fuck Murray, I'm in.

29:37.672 --> 29:40.207
That's really good the hear, Eric,
but we've been trying to call you.

29:40.241 --> 29:41.641
We?

29:43.210 --> 29:45.745
Yo.

29:45.779 --> 29:48.180
You're kidding.

29:50.684 --> 29:53.319
If it wasn't for Jordan Farmar
and that guy Kevin love,

29:53.353 --> 29:55.254
- I would have killed somebody.
- Drama?

29:55.288 --> 29:56.889
Yo.

29:56.923 --> 29:58.757
- Fuck!
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

29:58.792 --> 30:01.392
- How's Vince? - He's not gonna
be on camera anytime soon.

30:05.896 --> 30:07.863
Oh my God.

30:07.898 --> 30:10.365
- Where are you going?
- Out. What do you care?

30:10.400 --> 30:12.567
- Hey, bro, let us take you home.
- Fuck you, Johnny.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.235
<i>- - Vince.
- Fuck you too.</i>

30:14.269 --> 30:15.903
- What's your problem?
- You guys are my problem.

30:15.938 --> 30:17.905
I was fine until
you guys pissed me off.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.542
Now look, you got what you wanted...
I am officially out of control.

30:21.576 --> 30:23.410
- Come on, Vince.
- Sorry, Mr. chase,

30:23.444 --> 30:25.745
- we just need to finish the report.
- Call my lawyer.

30:25.779 --> 30:27.914
<i>I think you might want
to take care of that.</i>

30:27.948 --> 30:30.382
- Why?
- You know who this belongs to?

30:32.485 --> 30:34.586
Uh...
