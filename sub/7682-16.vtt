01:00.250 --> 01:05.047
We've got a pretty good planet here,
as planets go.

01:05.047 --> 01:09.968
The trouble is, we're letting it go
down the drain in too many places.

01:09.968 --> 01:14.932
Random testing downstream had
turned up some strange trace elements.

01:14.932 --> 01:16.642
It was pretty close to home,

01:16.642 --> 01:19.770
so the Phoenix Foundation
had an incentive to find out why

01:19.770 --> 01:24.483
what should be clean water
was showing up polluted.

02:41.434 --> 02:44.729
- Okay, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

03:09.045 --> 03:11.672
Buddy?

03:16.302 --> 03:18.930
What is it, boy?

03:21.807 --> 03:23.434
Buddy!

03:23.434 --> 03:26.020
Buddy?

03:26.270 --> 03:28.856
Buddy!

03:56.592 --> 03:59.428
Two minutes, 800 more gallons.

03:59.595 --> 04:02.222
Okay.

04:37.966 --> 04:40.594
Come on!

04:44.681 --> 04:47.309
Try some of your own poison!

04:52.230 --> 04:54.858
Come on, let's go!

04:56.943 --> 04:59.571
Hurry up!

05:00.614 --> 05:03.200
Look out!

05:07.162 --> 05:09.789
Go!

05:26.765 --> 05:29.934
What happened?
Hey, wait a minute!

05:30.185 --> 05:33.188
I'm on your side, I think.

05:43.907 --> 05:47.202
Hold still. I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.838
Cut open your pants leg.

05:59.631 --> 06:04.427
- I don't need any help.
- Got to stop that bleeding.

06:04.427 --> 06:07.013
- Who shot you?
- I don't know.

06:07.013 --> 06:09.599
But I saw one of them.

06:09.599 --> 06:12.059
I'll remember him.

06:12.059 --> 06:15.646
- He killed my dog.
- Yeah, I saw him.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.536
I don't like this.
That big guy saw your face.

06:30.536 --> 06:33.914
- Put a cork in it.
- What do you mean, put a cork in?

06:33.914 --> 06:37.626
I'm covering my butt. I'm out of
this deal, you call Dorman right now!

06:37.626 --> 06:40.212
Call him. Or I'll call him.

06:59.023 --> 07:01.859
I'm real sorry about your dog.

07:03.110 --> 07:06.572
I learned a long time ago...

07:06.739 --> 07:10.701
...you bury the dead and that's it.

07:15.456 --> 07:18.083
When did she die?

07:26.633 --> 07:29.219
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:29.219 --> 07:31.847
You got a name?

07:31.847 --> 07:33.891
MacGyver.

07:33.891 --> 07:36.518
Toberman.

07:37.311 --> 07:38.979
They call me Earthquake.

07:38.979 --> 07:41.607
Hey, Earthquake.

07:43.442 --> 07:45.694
We ought to have
a doctor look at your leg.

07:45.694 --> 07:49.239
I take care of myself.
I don't need no doctor.

07:49.239 --> 07:53.160
Well, we've got to go to
the city anyway to report that dumping.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.622
- Might as well let a doctor look at it.
- We don't have to go in the city.

07:57.622 --> 07:59.791
I don't like the city.

07:59.791 --> 08:02.043
Look, Earthquake,

08:02.043 --> 08:05.505
they were dumping
toxic waste into that stream.

08:05.505 --> 08:07.299
They killed your dog.

08:07.299 --> 08:09.759
My dog is dead.

08:09.759 --> 08:12.554
They're gone.

08:12.721 --> 08:15.307
You report it.

08:15.765 --> 08:18.560
Look, what happened out there today

08:18.560 --> 08:22.105
could provide answers to some
pretty important questions.

08:22.105 --> 08:23.690
But I need your help.

08:23.690 --> 08:26.234
You can identify one of them.
You're a witness.

08:26.234 --> 08:29.029
I've fought my wars.

08:30.655 --> 08:33.241
Okay.

08:35.368 --> 08:37.996
You got your reasons.

08:38.746 --> 08:41.332
I got mine.

08:43.208 --> 08:46.504
I work at a place
called the Phoenix Foundation.

08:46.504 --> 08:49.090
Will you remember that for me?

08:49.090 --> 08:51.676
Phoenix Foundation. Okay?

08:53.178 --> 08:55.179
Yeah.

08:55.179 --> 08:57.807
Take care of the leg, huh?

09:38.973 --> 09:41.017
How long will the cleanup take?

09:41.017 --> 09:44.437
Clean it, empty it, fill it with oil.
Half an hour, Mr Farber.

09:44.437 --> 09:48.607
Good. Then get it back on the road
and make a normal oil delivery.

09:48.607 --> 09:51.569
- You two, get in there and strip.
- What?

09:51.569 --> 09:54.739
Burn those coveralls.
We don't want any traces.

09:54.739 --> 09:56.323
As soon as you've changed,

09:56.323 --> 09:59.743
take tanker 1 6 there
up to the Twin Ridge Dump.

09:59.743 --> 10:04.081
It's full of chemical and low level
radioactive mix you put in that creek.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.667
Come on, Farber.
A legitimate delivery now?

10:06.667 --> 10:10.462
Exactly. After all,
that is our business.

10:13.841 --> 10:16.635
I got a rundown on
the guy they shot, Mr Farber.

10:16.635 --> 10:18.387
Daniel Toberman.

10:18.387 --> 10:21.390
Some kind of hermit.
Lives up in the backwoods.

10:21.390 --> 10:25.060
- Has he reported the incident?
- Not to the cops. Or the EPA.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.270
Good.

10:26.270 --> 10:30.149
And the running water will
have diluted the toxics by now.

10:30.149 --> 10:32.568
And they'll never
be able to trace them.

10:32.568 --> 10:34.486
I think we're clear.

10:34.486 --> 10:37.865
But run a background check
on this Toberman.

10:37.865 --> 10:41.410
- Why bother?
- Because I told you so.

10:41.493 --> 10:46.248
Look, I turned this operation
into a perfect legal cover.

10:46.248 --> 10:49.209
We have something to protect here.

10:49.209 --> 10:54.006
Toxic waste disposal is
very profitable for the organisation.

10:54.006 --> 10:57.551
In ten years we'll be
part of an industry worth billions.

10:57.551 --> 11:00.095
Bigger than narcotics.

11:00.095 --> 11:03.432
So, one mistake...

11:03.598 --> 11:05.100
...is one too many.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.103
Okay. We'll run a check on Toberman.

11:08.103 --> 11:10.856
But we're clean. He's nobody.

12:21.968 --> 12:26.013
I bet you this redneck's got himself
some travelling money.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.641
Give!

12:42.947 --> 12:45.074
What are you, nuts?

12:45.074 --> 12:47.493
I could have torn your head off.

12:47.493 --> 12:50.079
Get out of here.

13:48.095 --> 13:51.765
It's too bad you couldn't get
this man, Toberman, to testify.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.434
Pete, I tried.
The man wants to be left alone.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.396
Okay, Toberman
has every right to refuse.

13:57.396 --> 14:00.816
But getting this close to
an observed dumping operation...

14:00.816 --> 14:03.026
It's a shame we can't track it down.

14:03.026 --> 14:07.114
Well, I wouldn't go that far. MacGyver
has come up with a couple of good leads.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.991
The lab broke down
the sample I took from that creek.

14:09.991 --> 14:12.494
And toxic would be an understatement.

14:12.494 --> 14:16.957
Two acids, a carcinogen, and Cesium 1 37.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.751
Research gave us a list
of possible sources.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.211
It came down to...

14:21.211 --> 14:24.714
...Laboratory Chemicals, Inc.,
and Radiotronics Corp.

14:24.714 --> 14:26.716
Well, now you do have something.

14:26.716 --> 14:28.134
Yeah, it could be a lot.

14:28.134 --> 14:33.390
Lab Chemicals processes its toxic waste,
but Radiotronics uses a service.

14:33.390 --> 14:36.017
An outfit called Chemco Waste Disposal.

14:36.017 --> 14:37.477
Who are they?

14:37.477 --> 14:41.773
They were a nickel-and-dime storage and
disposal operation until two years ago

14:41.773 --> 14:45.568
when they were bought out by the
U.S. branch of an offshore corporation

14:45.568 --> 14:48.488
hiding behind a Caribbean registry.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.865
It was arranged
by the president of Chemco.

14:50.865 --> 14:54.202
Martin Farber.
Straight out of Harvard Law.

14:54.202 --> 14:56.121
He's not exactly Mr Clean.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.581
He's known to have
heavy mob connections.

14:58.581 --> 15:02.919
- Does that tell you anything?
- A lot. But not enough for a hearing.

15:02.919 --> 15:08.174
There's no proof. No legal evidence.
And no case without what's-his-name.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.802
You can't go in!

15:14.222 --> 15:16.808
Earthquake Toberman.

15:18.601 --> 15:22.855
- Helen, that's all right, thank you.
- I thought it over.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.232
I'm glad you did.

15:24.232 --> 15:26.567
We're all happy to see you,
Mr Toberman.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.611
I'm Karen Matsuga, staff attorney.

15:28.611 --> 15:31.948
You wanted me to testify.

15:32.115 --> 15:34.367
- I'll testify.
- That's great.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.245
Terrific. We have a line
on the guys that jumped you.

15:37.245 --> 15:38.955
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.290
At a place called Chemco Waste Disposal.

15:41.290 --> 15:44.085
The sign on that truck said Alamesa.

15:44.085 --> 15:47.338
Alamesa? Well, all right,
I'll check it out,

15:47.338 --> 15:49.298
but it sounds like a phoney to me.

15:49.298 --> 15:52.593
I don't care what they call themselves.
I saw one of 'em.

15:52.593 --> 15:54.011
Could you identify him?

15:54.011 --> 15:56.847
At night, in a fog, underwater.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.128
- How are you doing?
- Good.

16:28.128 --> 16:29.713
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah.

16:29.713 --> 16:32.132
- Got a hot load for you here.
- A hot what?

16:32.132 --> 16:34.551
A hot load. Where do you want it.

16:34.551 --> 16:36.720
What am I supposed to do with that?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.140
I don't know, my boss told me
to drop it off, so I'm dropping off.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.601
Yeah, well, take it in there.
I don't want it.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.478
- Where to?
- Go through the gate,

16:44.478 --> 16:47.898
make a right, go to the building,
make a right, ask for Mr Dorman.

16:47.898 --> 16:50.442
- He'll tell you where to put that.
- You got it.

16:50.442 --> 16:53.070
I'll get the gate.

17:21.223 --> 17:24.226
It was a truck just like that...

17:24.351 --> 17:27.479
...except it had Texas plates.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.565
Well, they must have
washed it down by now.

17:30.565 --> 17:33.193
Let's get inside.

17:52.796 --> 17:54.214
What's that?

17:54.214 --> 17:57.550
Well, it's kind of an
all-purpose electronic bloodhound.

17:57.550 --> 18:00.553
I got it set to react to the same

18:00.553 --> 18:03.932
chemical radiation recipe
I found in that water sample.

18:03.932 --> 18:10.021
Yeah, right. You handle that,
and I'll look for the guy I nailed.

18:15.652 --> 18:16.861
Dorman.

18:16.861 --> 18:18.905
That shipment from Excelsior get in?

18:18.905 --> 18:21.449
- What shipment?
- Two guys in a van.

18:21.449 --> 18:23.409
They said it was hot stuff.

18:23.409 --> 18:25.453
I never heard of Excelsior.

18:25.453 --> 18:28.748
Call the police and find those guys.

18:32.293 --> 18:33.961
What is this place?

18:33.961 --> 18:38.049
They recycle industrial waste
by filtering out toxics.

18:38.049 --> 18:40.676
At least, that's what
they're supposed to do.

18:40.676 --> 18:43.095
- It looks legit enough.
- Well, it is.

18:43.095 --> 18:48.893
But they're paid to reprocess waste.
If they dump it, where's the money go?

18:48.893 --> 18:52.480
And we're talking about some big bucks.

18:54.148 --> 18:56.776
We got something here.

19:10.289 --> 19:12.374
What is it?

19:12.374 --> 19:16.504
I don't know, but this thing's
giving off a low level of radiation.

19:16.504 --> 19:19.215
Alamesa.
That's the sign I saw on the truck.

19:19.215 --> 19:21.800
Wait!

19:22.384 --> 19:25.888
Let's at least be cautious about this.

19:30.809 --> 19:33.228
- What are you doing?
- Getting the lead out.

19:33.228 --> 19:35.981
We have to protect ourselves
from that radiation.

19:35.981 --> 19:38.567
Watch the door.

19:40.778 --> 19:44.615
Why don't we use the box
I've been dragging around?

19:44.615 --> 19:48.952
We're supposed to be dropping that off.
We can't walk out of here with it.

19:48.952 --> 19:51.580
Good point.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.229
Let's get back to the truck.

20:30.911 --> 20:33.079
That's him.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.707
He killed my dog.

21:04.360 --> 21:09.324
They're over there. Come on.
Come over here. Come on.

21:12.577 --> 21:15.413
What the hell's going on here?

21:18.750 --> 21:22.045
Yeah, that's the guy. The hillbilly.

21:25.465 --> 21:28.092
Get lost. Now.

21:40.313 --> 21:43.024
MacGyver... that was brilliant.

21:43.024 --> 21:44.734
No, it was just lucky.

21:44.734 --> 21:48.529
- It's the only place they didn't look.
- Yeah. Very lucky.

21:48.529 --> 21:50.907
Inside a piece of police evidence.

21:50.907 --> 21:53.201
You'll never know
what I had to go through

21:53.201 --> 21:55.119
to get you two and this released.

21:55.119 --> 21:58.205
We got it.
And I spotted that slimeball.

21:58.205 --> 22:01.167
- He got a name?
- Charles LaFond.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.878
Well, we got that.
We got the evidence. Go get him.

22:03.878 --> 22:05.755
Put the whole bunch in jail.

22:05.755 --> 22:09.550
It's not quite as easy as that.
I mean, we do have to establish a case.

22:09.550 --> 22:11.135
Establish what case?

22:11.135 --> 22:14.722
Karen's gotten us a hearing
with the State Environmental Agency.

22:14.722 --> 22:17.933
And with that evidence,
and your testimony to connect it,

22:17.933 --> 22:21.353
we've got a chance to rip
Chemco Waste Disposal wide open.

22:21.353 --> 22:24.690
What do you think a bunch of
paper shufflers are gonna do?

22:24.690 --> 22:26.775
- They're no court.
- No, they're not.

22:26.775 --> 22:29.445
But a fuse isn't a bomb, either.

22:29.445 --> 22:33.324
But if you light the end, and it
burns far enough, there is an explosion.

22:33.324 --> 22:37.161
They can send an investigation team
in there to go through everything.

22:37.161 --> 22:39.204
If we get these guys dead to rights,

22:39.204 --> 22:43.417
then the U.S. Attorney's office
will tear them apart.

22:43.417 --> 22:47.838
But we need solid evidence...
and an eyewitness.

22:49.298 --> 22:50.841
Well, here I am.

22:50.841 --> 22:53.052
Give your full name for the record.

22:53.052 --> 22:55.679
Daniel Royce Toberman.

22:55.804 --> 22:58.307
My only address...

22:58.307 --> 23:01.310
...half a section of county land.

23:02.019 --> 23:06.231
Where I found him
and his partner dumping poison.

23:06.231 --> 23:08.233
- Objection.
- Sustained.

23:08.233 --> 23:12.863
Mr Toberman, you may only testify as
to what you've personally seen or heard.

23:12.863 --> 23:17.034
I know it was poison. It killed my dog.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.331
We intend to present evidence
to that effect later, sir.

23:22.497 --> 23:27.252
Do you identify Charles LaFond as the
man who dumped liquids from a tanker?

23:27.252 --> 23:30.464
- I sure do.
- And how was that truck identified?

23:30.464 --> 23:33.675
The name on it?
Just said Alamesa.

23:33.717 --> 23:36.303
That's the sign, over there.

23:36.303 --> 23:40.265
You saw the sign,
the truck, and Mr LaFond?

23:40.265 --> 23:43.560
I sure did. Dumping toxics.

23:44.561 --> 23:47.272
Reserve the right to redirect.

23:47.522 --> 23:50.150
Your witness.

23:52.736 --> 23:55.989
- Daniel Royce Toberman.
- That's my name.

23:55.989 --> 24:00.744
Not all of it. You're also known as
"Earthquake" Toberman, aren't you?

24:00.744 --> 24:03.455
Yeah. That ain't got
nothing to do with this.

24:03.455 --> 24:08.752
Bear with me, please.
Why is it you're called Earthquake?

24:09.502 --> 24:13.506
Used a landslide once
to get out of trouble.

24:13.506 --> 24:15.091
Kids called me Earthquake.

24:15.091 --> 24:17.802
- The kids?
- My outfit.

24:17.969 --> 24:20.180
Handful of greenies.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.931
Some Vietnamese regulars.

24:21.931 --> 24:27.312
And you won a Bronze Star and three
commendations for bravery. Correct?

24:27.312 --> 24:29.647
I don't remember.
That was a long time ago.

24:29.647 --> 24:32.525
Do you have a
poor memory, Mr Toberman?

24:32.525 --> 24:35.111
No. I sure remember him.

24:35.528 --> 24:38.031
Do you remember
Captain Edward D'Angelo?

24:38.031 --> 24:42.368
In Saigon, 1 5 years ago?
Do you remember him?

24:42.660 --> 24:45.580
- I remember.
- Do you remember attacking him?

24:45.580 --> 24:50.168
Do you remember the court-martial? You
were described as borderline psychotic.

24:50.168 --> 24:53.838
I object. He's badgering my witness!

24:54.005 --> 24:56.841
Mr Toberman's past
is not the question here.

24:56.841 --> 25:00.595
Oh, but his credibility as a witness is.

25:00.761 --> 25:03.389
She's the reason.

25:04.599 --> 25:07.226
Tai Minh.

25:08.227 --> 25:10.813
Tai Minh was the reason.

25:10.896 --> 25:13.107
We wanted to get married.

25:13.107 --> 25:15.109
Rules and regulations.

25:15.109 --> 25:19.113
Your precious Captain D'Angelo
said it all.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.658
You see, white men marry white women.

25:24.285 --> 25:26.704
Where is she now, Mr Toberman?

25:26.704 --> 25:29.331
She didn't make it.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.752
She died.

25:36.505 --> 25:38.757
Did you kill her?

25:38.757 --> 25:40.843
Mr Toberman!

25:40.843 --> 25:42.720
Mr Toberman!

25:42.720 --> 25:46.557
- He tried to kill me!
- Mr Toberman, I will not have this!

25:46.557 --> 25:50.019
Ms Matsuga, restrain your witness
or I'll hold him in contempt.

25:50.019 --> 25:53.105
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

25:53.272 --> 25:56.400
This hearing is continued
tomorrow morning at 1 0.00 a.m.

25:56.400 --> 26:01.572
And if there are any further outbursts,
I will dismiss your cause of action.

26:01.572 --> 26:04.241
Let's get some air. Come on.

26:07.744 --> 26:10.581
Follow them. See where they go.

26:15.919 --> 26:19.381
I've never seen anybody
handle themselves like you just did.

26:19.381 --> 26:23.302
- Way to knock down that hillbilly, sir.
- No, I discredited him.

26:23.302 --> 26:26.013
I needled him
to set him up as psychotic.

26:26.013 --> 26:28.724
But we need one more final touch.

26:28.724 --> 26:31.309
Now listen closely...

26:33.395 --> 26:37.023
- Earthquake, you all right?
- I'm okay.

26:37.023 --> 26:39.734
What was that all about in there?

26:39.734 --> 26:42.904
Farber was right. I killed her.

26:43.738 --> 26:46.158
No, you didn't.

26:46.158 --> 26:48.743
She was killed in a crossfire in Saigon.

26:48.743 --> 26:54.624
You were on a mission in Cambodia.
There was nothing you could do.

26:54.624 --> 26:58.420
Karen's one of the best.
She's done some digging.

26:58.420 --> 27:02.215
She's on your side.
I think we all are.

27:02.799 --> 27:05.135
Then you know the rest.

27:05.135 --> 27:08.346
Well, we know they put you away
for striking an officer.

27:08.346 --> 27:11.391
- We don't know your side of it.
- D'Angelo.

27:11.391 --> 27:14.853
He really had it in for us.
I was going to get married anyway.

27:14.853 --> 27:16.604
I set up a Buddhist ceremony.

27:16.604 --> 27:19.441
He got wind of it.
Shipped me out.

27:19.441 --> 27:21.526
Before I could even tell her.

27:21.526 --> 27:24.070
I never saw her again.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.739
I didn't even know she was...

27:26.739 --> 27:28.408
...dead...

27:28.408 --> 27:29.951
...till I came back.

27:29.951 --> 27:34.455
- Just too damn late again.
- That's why you went after D'Angelo?

27:34.455 --> 27:36.332
That's why I wanted to kill him.

27:36.332 --> 27:40.169
- But you only hit him.
- Broke his nose.

27:40.336 --> 27:42.672
They gave you 1 8 months for that?

27:42.672 --> 27:46.300
- It was worth it.
- Once out, you headed for the hills?

27:46.300 --> 27:49.637
Nah, I tried the civilian bit.

27:49.804 --> 27:52.849
Got a greasy spoon
with a buddy from 'Nam.

27:52.849 --> 27:57.979
I thought that maybe I could
leave this pain and killing behind.

27:57.979 --> 28:01.065
But I was wrong. I was so wrong.

28:01.232 --> 28:05.152
I found that out one night
after closing up the restaurant.

28:05.152 --> 28:09.657
I was taking the garbage
to dump in the back alley.

28:09.657 --> 28:12.243
That's when it happened.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.899
A kid.

28:43.899 --> 28:46.694
A stupid kid with firecrackers.

28:47.486 --> 28:50.531
If I'd had had a weapon,
that kid would be dead.

28:50.531 --> 28:52.408
I'd have killed him like that.

28:52.408 --> 28:55.035
But you didn't.

28:55.411 --> 28:57.913
But I wanted to.
For a second, don't you see?

28:57.913 --> 29:00.124
Toberman...

29:00.124 --> 29:03.669
...you could have handed Farber
his head, but you backed off.

29:03.669 --> 29:05.337
Does that make me a saint?

29:05.337 --> 29:09.633
No, that makes you human, just like
the rest of us, with feelings and pain.

29:09.633 --> 29:12.719
The Farbers of this world
get fat off of people who...

29:12.719 --> 29:16.306
Who run off and hide.
Who don't care. Well, you do care.

29:16.306 --> 29:19.601
You care about Buddy and
what happens when they dump garbage.

29:19.601 --> 29:23.272
That doesn't sound like a killer to me.

29:27.526 --> 29:30.320
I'd better get back to the Foundation.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.948
I want to be ready
to go after them in the morning.

29:32.948 --> 29:35.575
I'll drive you.

29:36.868 --> 29:40.205
- You coming?
- Nah.

29:41.498 --> 29:45.752
I'll stay here...
and sort some stuff out in my head.

29:45.752 --> 29:48.338
Thanks anyway.

29:49.339 --> 29:51.925
All right.

30:02.018 --> 30:04.145
Hey, Popeye...

30:04.145 --> 30:08.066
Mr Farber wanted me
to give you something.

30:13.238 --> 30:15.657
Good. Let's get it over with.

30:15.657 --> 30:19.160
You're right, let's get it over with.

30:41.849 --> 30:44.477
You, hold it! Don't move!

30:46.604 --> 30:49.232
I didn't do it. I didn't!

30:49.232 --> 30:51.818
I said, hold it!

30:52.026 --> 30:54.654
Earthquake, don't move!

30:57.115 --> 30:59.200
Keep everybody out of this building.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.452
Stay back.

31:01.452 --> 31:04.705
He couldn't do it. We just talked.
He's not that kind of man.

31:04.705 --> 31:07.041
We know, but we're
gonna have to prove it.

31:07.041 --> 31:11.379
Call Pete, tell him what's happened.
It's obvious this whole thing's a setup.

31:11.379 --> 31:15.216
Earthquake's got to be
headed for Chemco.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.919
Grade! What happened?

35:30.010 --> 35:32.888
Grade, come on!
Can you hear me?

35:32.888 --> 35:35.891
- You okay?
- I don't think so.

35:37.267 --> 35:39.978
Mr Farber, Grade's been
busted up pretty good.

35:39.978 --> 35:43.774
It must be Toberman.
Get Grade patched up.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.401
And then find that gorilla.

35:49.446 --> 35:52.032
Let's get you fixed up...

36:32.614 --> 36:36.367
Well, Farber...
You got a story to tell.

36:36.367 --> 36:41.664
- And you're coming with me right now.
- Oh, I doubt that.

36:41.664 --> 36:44.417
You see, you've been expected.

37:01.184 --> 37:03.019
All right, keep moving!

37:03.019 --> 37:05.646
Come on.

37:08.024 --> 37:11.068
Let's go, buddy, let's go. Walk.

37:25.374 --> 37:29.962
Straight ahead.
I want to talk with him in there.

38:11.795 --> 38:14.423
Back off!

38:14.882 --> 38:16.759
Get your hands up.

38:16.759 --> 38:19.386
Up!

38:22.765 --> 38:26.602
- I could waste him right now.
- Not yet.

38:27.895 --> 38:29.938
The police have simple minds.

38:29.938 --> 38:33.609
We'll have to give them a simple story.

38:33.775 --> 38:36.361
Get Grade.

38:37.029 --> 38:39.615
Yeah, right.

40:04.574 --> 40:08.369
When I was a kid, my Grandpa
gave me two things I'll never forget.

40:08.369 --> 40:13.541
A subscription to Popular Mechanics,
and a chemistry set.

40:13.583 --> 40:17.420
And this place was
one big chemistry set.

41:28.866 --> 41:31.535
Chlorine, mixed with the right catalyst

41:31.535 --> 41:35.747
and near perfect timing
on that inner tube, was all I needed.

41:35.747 --> 41:38.375
I hoped.

41:43.046 --> 41:47.134
- Just get going.
- Well, what's it all about?

41:47.134 --> 41:49.928
Farber wants to see you.
That's all you need to know.

41:49.928 --> 41:52.556
Okay.

42:03.233 --> 42:05.318
- Inside.
- What's going on, Dorman?

42:05.318 --> 42:08.488
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Grade.

42:08.864 --> 42:11.491
Business is business.

42:13.410 --> 42:15.829
Please, Mr Farber. Don't kill me.

42:15.829 --> 42:17.873
I've done what you asked me. Please.

42:17.873 --> 42:20.667
A real company man till the last.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.128
- Yes I am.
- I'm impressed.

42:23.128 --> 42:26.172
You see, he killed LaFond
and then came here.

42:26.172 --> 42:28.508
We had no choice but to shoot him.

42:28.508 --> 42:30.510
After he murdered you, Grade.

42:30.510 --> 42:32.345
Congratulations.

42:32.345 --> 42:34.723
You just made number two
on the hit parade.

42:34.723 --> 42:37.017
Why don't you give the police a call?

42:37.017 --> 42:40.395
- Now?
- It starts with a prowler.

42:40.562 --> 42:42.772
Then we'll hear shots.

42:42.772 --> 42:45.733
They'll get here just in time.

42:47.193 --> 42:49.779
No, Dorman, please!

43:20.268 --> 43:22.311
- Cops are on their way.
- Good.

43:22.311 --> 43:26.691
- Then let's not disappoint 'em.
- Get the gun!

43:35.032 --> 43:38.869
- What's that?
- It came from over there.

43:45.710 --> 43:48.337
What the...?

44:24.373 --> 44:26.959
Earthquake, don't!

44:35.676 --> 44:38.303
Don't do it.

44:42.516 --> 44:45.143
It's over, man. It's over.

44:48.856 --> 44:50.983
I want to turn state's evidence.

44:50.983 --> 44:52.484
The man up there, Farber.

44:52.484 --> 44:55.570
He paid me to kill my friend,
and I didn't want to do it.

44:55.570 --> 44:58.031
Just listen to me, I'm telling you...

44:58.031 --> 45:01.535
I'm not responsible! It's him. Farber!

45:03.495 --> 45:06.248
You ought to be
more careful, Mr Farber.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.834
You almost fell.

45:23.431 --> 45:26.476
Chemco Waste isn't
the only one we put out of business.

45:26.476 --> 45:30.230
This guy, Farber, had his fingers
in about a half a dozen toxic pies

45:30.230 --> 45:33.525
in five different states.
All of them running the same scam.

45:33.525 --> 45:37.779
All out of business.
Thanks to you, Earthquake.

45:37.779 --> 45:40.115
You know, Karen's right.

45:40.115 --> 45:42.534
We're all really grateful to you.

45:42.534 --> 45:45.078
So, what's next?
What are you going to do now?

45:45.078 --> 45:50.667
I just want to go home.
MacGyver's going to give me a ride.

45:51.042 --> 45:54.212
Hey... Jeep's ready and waiting.

45:55.171 --> 45:58.258
And... so is my friend here.

45:58.424 --> 46:01.803
Maybe I should say...

46:01.970 --> 46:04.556
...Earthquake's friend.

46:08.935 --> 46:11.771
Man... look at him.

46:11.938 --> 46:15.400
Ain't he something?
Ain't he just something?

46:15.400 --> 46:17.985
She... sure is.

46:21.322 --> 46:23.908
She's really special.

46:25.618 --> 46:28.246
Yeah.
