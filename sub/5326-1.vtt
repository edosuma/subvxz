26:43.644 --> 26:46.396
our empire's oldest capital city.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.605
What a tosser.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.148
But never for one moment

26:49.525 --> 26:51.067
daunted or dismayed,

26:52.027 --> 26:54.028
let us remember the fallen,

26:54.571 --> 26:57.782
their sacrifice in the face
of a merciless enemy.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.619
- We are proud to have shared...
- Which he'd know all about.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.704
How dare you.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.247
You, little prick,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.333
are being disloyal and abusive
to your sovereign.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.378
- The King is 10 times the man you are.
- He certainly is.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.339
Oh, come on. You're not buying
this load of bollocks, are you?

27:13.424 --> 27:15.049
Shut up. Shut up.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.468
Nobody's gonna make me miserable today.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.803
I've waited too long for it.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.179
SOLDIER: Sit down, love.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.184
KING GEORGE:
It is the children of our country...

27:22.391 --> 27:24.392
- The King!
- The King.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.643
ALL: The King!

27:25.811 --> 27:28.104
KING GEORGE: ...please God, forever.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.111
If you ask me...

27:35.571 --> 27:36.904
Which I wasn't.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.448
You got exactly what you deserved.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.908
Wait!

27:42.077 --> 27:44.412
The King... Excuse me.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.372
The King was trying jolly hard,
as a matter of fact,

27:46.457 --> 27:47.623
to offer words of encouragement...

27:47.708 --> 27:49.250
Well, he jolly well pissed me off.

27:50.919 --> 27:51.919
"Fallen."

27:52.921 --> 27:56.090
That's a nice word for a nasty,
dirty, painful business.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.426
Stop!

27:58.927 --> 28:00.803
- Where are you going?
- This way.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.597
I need to get to Trafalgar Square.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.142
The people in that public house

28:06.352 --> 28:08.144
love their king and their country.

28:08.479 --> 28:09.479
War's over,

28:09.855 --> 28:11.731
and for some reason I came back

28:11.815 --> 28:13.941
to the same old column-dodging posh gits

28:14.026 --> 28:15.568
with plummy voices on the wireless...

28:15.652 --> 28:17.403
Plummy voices like mine, I suppose?

28:17.529 --> 28:18.529
Exactly.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.574
Well, let me tell you,
whatever your name is,

28:21.658 --> 28:23.701

28:25.204 --> 28:26.412

28:28.207 --> 28:29.207

28:29.291 --> 28:33.127
As a matter of fact, my mother
did exactly that in the Blitz.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.129
And did you help with the sandwiches?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.048
I'm in the Auxiliary Territorial Service,

28:46.225 --> 28:47.683

- Hmm.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.979

29:33.063 --> 29:35.189
Well, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.442
Will you please take me
to Trafalgar Square?

29:37.526 --> 29:38.526
No.

29:38.694 --> 29:39.735

I said stop that at once!

01:09:58.903 --> 01:09:59.903

Yes. I'd like to think
he was my friend still.

Thank you all so very much for bothering.

They'll be going doo-lally at the palace.

Go there, tell the King and Queen
that everything is under control.

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:47.636
They'll have us shot, ma'am.

We aren't letting you out of our sight
for a second,

you may be a captain,

but I'm a princess.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:03.485
And where is your cap?

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:06.364
I will not be seen

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.759
Just my sodding luck.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.993
You said you were going to see your mum.
Can we come with you?

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:34.766
I can't take her back like this.

Jack, let me explain.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.341
The situation was... Complicated.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.010
You lied to me all night long,

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.595
because you're a princess and you think

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:13.388
you can get away with whatever you like.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:14.973
On the contrary.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.559
- So what do I call you?

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.561
- Your Highness?
- Lizzy.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.146
Your Majesty?

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:24.066
- Lizzy is fine.
- No. No, it's not. Not any more.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.235
You made a first-class prat out of me.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.407
Well, I had to.

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:36.995
I've never so much as made
a cup of blooming tea for myself.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.289
Never been out on my own.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.000
Not once, not properly.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.962
Even in the ATS, I had to sit between
chaperones and come home for dinner

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.839
while the rest of them ate compo rations.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.134
But tonight nobody gave a damn who I was.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.692
And if it wasn't for Margaret running off,

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.724

Isn't it a bit early?

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.232
She's a costermonger.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.278
She sells fruit and veg.

- Yes.
- Poor old boy.

Never wanted the job, did he?

Got on with it, though.

Yes, he did, didn't he?

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:12.043
My sister, who's not used to having a drink,
got into a bit of a fix.

No. He doesn't care for my type.

He had a bad war.

- Told me.
- Really?

with such idealism.

I don't know.

everything they could possibly want.

wants not to be her?

Got to make ends meet somehow.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.747
Walk down the boulevards under the trees.

01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:01.791
Go up the Eiffel Tower...

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:03.918
If it's still there.

01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:05.003
(LAUGHS)

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:07.672
Montmartre looks so pretty in pictures,

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:09.882
and the Louvre,
and the Luxembourg Gardens.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:12.927
On a Sunday afternoon.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.140
Just another girl in the crowd.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.603
Without everyone bowing and curtseying.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:25.857
- We could go dancing.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.359
- I do dance rather well.
- I remember.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.028
And I'd teach you to be better.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.822
Thank you.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.534
All that freedom to breathe.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.370
All that "what if?"

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.389
(ENGINE SLOWING)

01:22:58.891 --> 01:22:59.891

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:23.122
We both know that's not going to happen.

01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.086
Quite.

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:39.597
(ENGINE REVVS)

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.945
After the Ritz, Trafalgar Square.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.699
Then the Curzon Club with this first chap,

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.867
the one before Raymond and Stan,

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.662
where he gave me this
pink fizzy stuff to drink

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:05.456
that I must say tasted rather strange.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:08.459
Then Soho.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.045
- Soho?
- An interesting place.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:16.092
Dead horses, this strange smoke
that everyone was just wild for...

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:19.137
By the way, what's a knocking shop?

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:21.472
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.221

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.901
Come on.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:50.334
Papa... Mummy.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.338
Sorry we're late.

01:24:57.885 --> 01:24:59.677
This is my friend, Jack Hodges.

01:25:02.473 --> 01:25:03.806
He should have breakfast with us.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.151
I don't think that that
would be appropriate.

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:11.189
Well, I do.

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:35.838
We heard your speech, sir.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.175
In a pub.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.094
KING GEORGE: Did you indeed? In a pub?

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.681
Presumably everyone was too drunk
to take any notice.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:50.311
Actually, they liked it.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.232
They liked it very much.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.907
Where did you meet my daughter?

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:04.951
On the number 14 bus.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:08.246
Really? I've always wanted to go on a bus.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:09.789
I jumped on the wrong one.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.541
Margaret was on the number nine, you see.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:14.198
Jack's been wonderful all night.

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:15.837
Really?

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:17.505
In what way wonderful?

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:21.509
I was very lucky to have him

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:23.386
to look after me.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680
He's a hero, you know.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:28.182
He flew more than 50 missions over Germany.

01:26:28.559 --> 01:26:30.434
Oh, right. How did you get along?

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:33.479
I did the best I could.

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:36.858
You see that badge?

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:38.776
That one?

01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:42.405
It indicates Jack's an ace
and has shot down at least five planes.

01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:45.233
He thinks I don't know
what that badge means, but I do.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:46.659
He's a bit of a good 'un underneath.

01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:47.743
Lizzy.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:58.838
(LAUGHS)

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.842
I don't see what's so funny.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.887
Jack has to go somewhere now

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.851
and I would like a word with him
before he does.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:10.725
Oh, and I owe him some money.

01:27:11.018 --> 01:27:12.018
How much?

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.448
Seven pounds, eleven and fourpence, please.

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:16.522
Well, we...

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.524
Don't keep much here,

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:22.403
but I'll, er, have a whip-round
amongst the footmen.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:45.843
So...

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.889
You seem to have
brought her home for us safe and sound.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:55.394
Well done.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.314
- For everything.
- Thank you, sir.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400
Lillibet...

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:04.528
No one must ever know about this.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:08.491
You spent last night at the Ritz.

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:20.252
Lillibet.

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:23.381
I'm having luncheon
with the American ambassador.

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:27.009
Foreign affairs. Would you like to join us?

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:28.886
I'd like that.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:30.930
Oh, good.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:34.475
Good.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.235
Sorry.

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.070
Could sleep for a week.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:50.992
By the way,

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:54.537
I don't think the future
belongs to just my lot.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:28:59.709
And I don't think you do either.

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:06.549
Right.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.327
Papa should have that money by now.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:13.097
(LOUDLY) Is it action stations again?

01:29:13.807 --> 01:29:15.266

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.062
Mmm. Bye, Jack.

01:29:20.814 --> 01:29:21.856
Jack's off.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.693
There's no way I'm going to be on parade
in 30 minutes.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.319
I could get Papa to call.

01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:28.946
He's rather influential.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:31.198
- Actually, I could call.
- No.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.367
Thank you,
but I can take care of it myself.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.912
So are you going to go back?

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.709
Yes, I am.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:46.297
