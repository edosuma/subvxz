SEAN: Previously
on The Event...

00:02.469 --> 00:04.562
Tell me where Dempsey is.
He Ieft for France
this morning.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.298
Somewhere in the
Jura Mountains.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.000
I made good on my
end of the deal,
now I'm done.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.473
You're done when
I say you're done.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.134
When I get Dempsey,
you'II be free.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.906
Why is Vicky helping you?
I'm blackmailing her.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.106
Ifyou haven't
noticed, Ms. Roberts
doesn't do anything

00:15.181 --> 00:16.375
she doesn't want to do.

00:16.449 --> 00:19.441
My guest tonight
is Senator Catherine
Lewis of AIaska.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.850
What kind of game
are you playing?

00:20.920 --> 00:22.478
Tell me what Inostranka is

00:22.555 --> 00:24.921
and I'II start throwing
softballs instead of grenades.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.117
Deal.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.716
ELIAS: Move your men
in and take the church.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.989
You have no idea what
we are capable of.

00:30.797 --> 00:31.786
It's them.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.859
SOPHIA: I want three buses
delivered to the church.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.897
There may be an
opportunity to exploit.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.538
Simon Lee is one of them.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.434
It's Agent Lee's voice.
What the hell is going on?

00:43.543 --> 00:45.010
SOPHIA:
We're completely defenceless.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.272
She was bluffing.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.677
This ends now.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.808
GERARD: I have enough fuel
for one bus, that's it.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.376

Pull ahead of her now!

01:55.448 --> 01:56.813
We're safe.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.215
This is where
Thomas has been
hiding our people.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.086
I want confirmations.
We need identification
on the casualties.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.422
We have cameras
on the ground, sir.
They're deploying now.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.255
BLAKE: Switching
cameras now sir.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.625
Congratulations, Agent Lee.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.728
We managed to cripple
their command structure.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.671
Your hard work is finally
starting to pay off.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.540
Thank you, sir,

02:25.078 --> 02:26.272
but it was
a team effort.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.145
Director Sterling,

02:29.549 --> 02:31.710
with me. We need to prepare
a statement for the press.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.479
(SIGHS)

02:40.226 --> 02:41.716
Sophia is gone

02:41.794 --> 02:43.659
and Agent Lee is our only
Iink to where she might be.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.391
We should arrest him,
interrogate him.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.898
I can't guarantee
that Simon will talk.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.868
And once he finds out
we know he's one of them,
our advantage is Iost.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.234
Agent Lee is gonna
wonder how we knew.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.172
He'II suspect his
cover's been blown,
if he doesn't already.

02:56.242 --> 03:00.076
Then we need to flush him out
sooner rather than Iater.

03:32.178 --> 03:35.272
Agent Lee, we caught a break.

03:35.615 --> 03:40.075
NASA satellites have
identified two unique
electromagnetic signatures

03:40.153 --> 03:42.451
corresponding to the
activation of the portal.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.186
They're analysing
the data now,

03:45.258 --> 03:48.421
but it could Iead us
to the Iocation of
their portal device

03:49.329 --> 03:52.298
as well as the Iocation
of the third bus and Sophia.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.427

to move on it.

a call to Sophia

No, Mr. President.

We need to get you out now.

Be careful out there, Simon.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.375
You, too.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.923
We've just received
word that government
sources now believe

07:45.031 --> 07:48.228
the Pakistani terrorist
organisation, Tariq-E-Salim,

07:48.367 --> 07:51.530
is responsible for
the devastating attack on
the Washington Monument.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.165
At this point, no word
on when President Martinez
will address the nation,

07:55.241 --> 07:57.266
but in a written statement,

07:57.343 --> 08:00.073
he has vowed to bring
those responsible to justice.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.306
The trail on Agent
Lee has gone cold,

08:02.381 --> 08:05.817
but we have his picture
out to all federal and
Iocal Iaw enforcement

08:05.918 --> 08:08.079
saying he's wanted
in connection with
the attacks.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.145
Someone warned him.
Someone helped him get away.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.848
It appears that
way, Mr. President.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.913

08:13.059 --> 08:14.890
It could be anyone.

have made inroads
at the highest Ievels.

One of them was
appointed to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals

these SIeepers out.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.972

ideas on the subject.

were your constituents.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.142
Yes, Frank and Jackie Gibbons.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.202
Oh...
I spoke with their family

09:07.280 --> 09:09.840
and reiterated your
pledge that their murders
will not go unpunished.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.150
And they won't.
That's why you're here.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.616
The attack wasn't the work
of Pakistani terrorists.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.645
That's just our cover story.

09:18.791 --> 09:19.985
It was the SIeepers.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.793
Oh, my God.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.462
Why are you telling me this?

09:27.533 --> 09:29.831
Because we need
to find them.
AII of them.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.700
And the program we
need to adopt needs
to come from Congress,

09:32.772 --> 09:34.137
it can't come from
the executive branch.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.707
If we don't uncover
the non-terrestrials,
our country, our planet,

09:38.311 --> 09:39.505
may be forever destroyed.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.942
What do you need me
to do, Mr. President?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.250
I want to initiate a program
to test every American's DNA.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.188
As you know, the SIeepers are
genetically different from us

09:54.293 --> 09:57.285
by a Iittle Iess than
one percent. We can
screen for that.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.623
And you want to do this
without anyone knowing.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.533
You gave up your career
as a doctor when your
husband ran for office.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.834
And before that,
you spent time
at the CDC.

10:07.139 --> 10:11.303
In your opinion, how can we
covertly pursue such a policy?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.674
That's assuming you're onboard
with the idea, of course.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.108
My advice,

10:21.520 --> 10:22.612
we...

10:23.856 --> 10:26.086
We have the CDC
announce an outbreak

10:26.158 --> 10:28.683
of a drug-resistant
strain of tuberculosis.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.891
Convince people
that the only way
to stop a pandemic

10:32.198 --> 10:34.496
is to impose
mandatory testing.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.225
Then, with each
test you administer,

10:37.603 --> 10:40.299
you can secretly
gather a DNA sample.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.065
Can you get this
program up and running?

10:43.876 --> 10:46.208
It would take some time
to Iay the groundwork.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.511
Let's start now. Here.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.745
A pilot program to test
the White House personnel.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.613
I support that.

10:55.955 --> 10:59.288
Mr. President, maybe we
should discuss this internally

10:59.358 --> 11:01.485
before putting
anything in motion.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.688
The time for discussion
is over. Senator, you're
running point on this,

11:04.797 --> 11:07.698
but I want you
to report all of your
findings directly to me.

11:08.934 --> 11:09.958
Understood?

11:10.036 --> 11:11.025

12:48.734 --> 12:50.964
That's actually
the wrong way.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.701
What do you mean
it's the wrong way?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.900

to Iook after you.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.245
By who?

13:06.418 --> 13:07.680
It's not important.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.983
We Iook after
each other here.

13:10.389 --> 13:11.720
Are you telling me
that I can't Ieave?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.418
There's no reason to Ieave.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.052
Everything you
need is here.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.052
You're safe.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.959
I don't feel safe.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.468
Now that's just silly.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.965
But you should be
heading back now.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.737

We all did.

15:48.113 --> 15:52.641
To refrain from harming
benevolent civilizations
Iike the one on this planet.

15:53.719 --> 15:57.712
That has been my
guiding principle
for the Iast 66 years,

15:58.190 --> 16:02.752
but, now, after
witnessing the slaughter
of our people in Los Angeles,

16:07.499 --> 16:10.935
I can no Ionger consider
this population benevolent.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.469
The oath no
Ionger applies.

16:18.544 --> 16:22.173
What matters now
is that our star
has begun to implode.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.612
Two billion Iives
are at stake.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.213
I'm prepared to bring
Thomas' plan to fruition.

16:30.289 --> 16:35.022
We will bring all our
people here and make
this planet our own.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.856
No matter what that
means for those who call
this place their home.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.877
Dempsey's expedition
is deep in the mountains,

16:55.147 --> 16:56.808
almost to the Swiss border.

16:56.882 --> 16:59.350
That's where he's set up camp?
(SCOFFS) No, not this man.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.680
He Ioves to spend
his billions.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.190
My contact tells me
he's taken a place at
the Chateau de Perrault.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.314
Where's that?

17:06.392 --> 17:09.224
Right here in
the town of Morez.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.230
But it appears that
his business here
is concluding.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.694
Then we need to get to him
tonight before he Ieaves.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.202
You have details
on his security?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.897
Oh, yes. French,
former British SAS.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.997
The estate is gated,

17:23.075 --> 17:26.044
but to the east is
the Risoux Forest.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.272
You can approach
from the treeline.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.507
There's a service
road right here,

17:33.852 --> 17:36.252
and at the end
of it, le chateau.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.252
The road puts you
right in his backyard.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.192

relaxed before first Iight.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.489

the French police?

18:14.726 --> 18:16.956

going to care about what
he's done in America?

which we don't,

Dempsey has enough
money to buy himself
out of anything.

What's the alternative?
You want justice?

18:36.181 --> 18:37.978

18:38.884 --> 18:40.681
There's only one way.

I hope it was
worth the trip.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.850
My trip's not over
until you're dead.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.052
Someone needs
to put you down.

31:31.189 --> 31:35.888
It may be difficult for
you to understand this,
but we are on the same side.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.922
The truth is,
Ms. Roberts,

31:37.996 --> 31:40.794
I am part of a Iong
Iine of people,

31:41.566 --> 31:42.897
sentinels,

31:43.568 --> 31:48.631
who have been given the task
of securing us against them.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.467
Them?

31:55.213 --> 31:57.374
What can you tell
me about Mr. Walker?

32:00.451 --> 32:02.112
What type of
connections
does he have?

32:03.288 --> 32:07.452
How did he co-opt
you into joining him
in this crusade?

32:07.525 --> 32:09.823
Why do you care so
much about Walker?

32:10.561 --> 32:13.223
Because every time I've
put an obstacle in his path,

32:13.298 --> 32:15.289
he has found some
way to surmount it.

32:16.367 --> 32:17.356
(CHUCKLING)

32:18.069 --> 32:20.128
It's very curious.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.637
However, it's, uh,

32:24.742 --> 32:26.107
becoming clearer.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.377
Part of the tapestry.

32:33.518 --> 32:34.780
Kill her.

(BOTTLE SHATTERING)

33:18.096 --> 33:19.188
Sean?

33:23.267 --> 33:25.292
What are you doing?
We were ambushed.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.600
What?
You set us up.

33:27.972 --> 33:29.701
No... Mais non, je te jure.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.503
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.168
They took Vicky.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.311
And there was no chateau.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.515
So now you're going to tell me
exactly what I want to know,

33:40.184 --> 33:41.708
or you're gonna
wish you were dead.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.456
CATHERINE: I have a contact
at the CDC that we can trust.

33:53.531 --> 33:57.865
He's been adding dummy
reports of drug-resistant
TB cases to their database.

33:57.969 --> 34:01.370
This will mimic the early
signs of a potential epidemic.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.703
And that should
support our cover-up.
At Ieast for now.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.437
Now, where do we stand
with the pilot program?

34:06.644 --> 34:09.010
I've asked everyone
with White House clearance

34:09.080 --> 34:10.706
to sign the testing agreement.

34:10.915 --> 34:11.973
And?

34:12.850 --> 34:14.909
Some were harder
to convince than others,

34:15.453 --> 34:17.683
but the threat
of an extended

34:17.755 --> 34:20.155
involuntary quarantine
seemed to sway them.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.521
When does the testing begin?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.956
A few days.

34:23.761 --> 34:26.696
But you should know that
there was one holdout.

34:26.764 --> 34:27.822
Who?

34:28.833 --> 34:29.993
Your wife.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.101
You don't have
to test Christina.

34:38.109 --> 34:40.100
Well, she may not
be a staff member,

34:40.178 --> 34:42.668
but not only does she
work here, she Iives here.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.607
She knows the truth
about the test.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.813
You told her?
I did.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.587
She has some ethical
issues about the program,

34:51.355 --> 34:53.380
and her objection to the test
is a philosophical one.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.447
Hmm.

34:55.025 --> 34:58.985
And you're certain that's why
she's refusing to be tested?

35:04.235 --> 35:06.703
You're going to cross my
wife's name off that Iist.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.572
Mr. President, you asked
me to clean your house.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.735
And that's what I'm doing.
Catherine.

35:13.411 --> 35:14.503

is he holding Vicky?

35:51.516 --> 35:53.006

I would never do anything
to harm Vicky, you know that!
