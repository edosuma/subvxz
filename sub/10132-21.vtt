about this girl.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.797
with those slot machines.

09:07.839 --> 09:08.965
They look like fun.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.509
Just a minute, honey.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.843
It's against the law

09:10.550 --> 09:11.843
to play those machines

09:11.885 --> 09:13.845
unless you're over 21.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.722
Now why don't you and DJ

09:13.887 --> 09:15.722
have a seat right over here.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.015
This is my first live audience.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.933
I really need you guys

09:17.057 --> 09:18.933
to cheer me on.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.478
Hey, we're there for you, babe.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.603
Danny, I'm sorry I'm late.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.147
Hey, Becky,

09:22.645 --> 09:24.147
where've you been?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.524
We're supposed

09:24.189 --> 09:25.524
to have breakfast together.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.983
Didn't Danny give

09:25.565 --> 09:26.983
you my message?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.569
Not yet.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.569
Jess, Becky can't make it.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.946
She has a breakfast meeting

09:29.610 --> 09:31.946
with Todd Masters.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.365
How could you do this to me?

09:33.407 --> 09:34.657
Well, I've just been nervous

09:33.407 --> 09:34.657
about the show.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.577
Not you. You.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.786
Jess, I'm really sorry

09:38.828 --> 09:40.205
but we'll have to talk

09:38.828 --> 09:40.205
about this later.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.957
Danny, we go on the air

09:40.247 --> 09:42.957
in less than a minute..

09:42.999 --> 09:44.292
What's goin' on here?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.169
She's just excited

09:44.334 --> 09:46.169
to meet a movie star.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.129
I mean, suppose you could

09:46.211 --> 09:48.129
spend some time

09:48.171 --> 09:51.799
with Michelle Pfeiffer,

09:48.171 --> 09:51.799
what would you do?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.512
Becky wouldn't dare.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.723
Two, one..

09:58.765 --> 10:01.059
♪ Wake Up ♪♪

10:01.101 --> 10:03.228

Our first guest is one of

10:21.746 --> 10:25.125
the biggest stars in Hollywood.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.169
I don't think I need to say

10:25.166 --> 10:28.169
anything but two words.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.046
Todd Masters.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.631
[cheering]

10:42.434 --> 10:43.810
- Hi, Danny.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.810
- Hi.

10:43.851 --> 10:44.852
Nice to see you again, Rebecca.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.314
Oh-h.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.400
Ladies, I did something

10:47.355 --> 10:50.400
this morning with Todd

10:50.442 --> 10:53.278
that every woman in America

10:50.442 --> 10:53.278
fantasizes about.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.113
[crowd cheers]

10:57.991 --> 10:59.784
We ate breakfast together.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.455
And now I know why breakfast

11:03.497 --> 11:05.706
is the most important meal

11:03.497 --> 11:05.706
of the day.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.001
[crowd cheering]

11:09.961 --> 11:14.466
Well, we'll be back with more

11:09.961 --> 11:14.466
of "My Breakfast with Todd"

11:14.508 --> 11:18.178
after a word from the people

11:14.508 --> 11:18.178
who pay for my breakfast.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.514
[applause]

11:20.555 --> 11:21.764
[bell ringing]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.350
Let's go see what's going on.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.521
Joey, did you see

11:25.519 --> 11:27.521
the way Becky's drooling

11:27.562 --> 11:30.190
all over that Todd Masters?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.651
I'm gonna go upstairs and join

11:30.231 --> 11:32.651
Michelle in the daycare center

11:32.691 --> 11:34.569
and catch the last half

11:32.691 --> 11:34.569
of Gilligan.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.240
Joey, Joey, check it out! This

11:36.446 --> 11:39.240
lady just won a ton of money.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.908
I wish we could play.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.495
Settle down, girls. Let me tell

11:40.950 --> 11:43.495
you something about gambling.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.290
Most of these people lose.

11:47.332 --> 11:51.503
I don't hear anybody screaming,

11:47.332 --> 11:51.503
"I lost, I lost."

11:51.545 --> 11:55.382
Well, girls, stay behind the

11:51.545 --> 11:55.382
ropes and watch as I teach you

11:55.423 --> 11:58.009
how stupid it is to gamble.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.765
[bell ringing]

12:04.807 --> 12:06.393
You won! You won!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.229
Alright, Joey.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.229
Two dollars.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.314
Girls, first rule of gambling.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.816
Never be fooled

12:11.356 --> 12:13.816
by beginner's luck.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.324
Whoa! Ten dollars.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.324
Alright.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.201
Yeah.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.538
Girls, second rule of gambling.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.538
Don't quit while you're hot.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.291
Come on, baby. Joey needs

12:26.580 --> 12:30.291
a new pair of shoes.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.423
(Joey)

12:32.751 --> 12:36.423
'Orange, orange, orange! Yes!'

12:36.464 --> 12:38.091
Twenty dollars worth of juice.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.761
Don't stop now. If you get

12:38.132 --> 12:42.761
four 7s, you can win $100,000.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.181
Girls, I'm gonna get one of

12:42.803 --> 12:45.181
those change buckets.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.684
You stay here, guard my machines

12:45.223 --> 12:47.684
with your lives.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.644
If anybody goes

12:47.726 --> 12:49.644
near it, scream.

12:49.686 --> 12:53.607
Because I'm hot, I'm burning,

12:49.686 --> 12:53.607
I'm wasting time. Yes.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.861
Oh, I can't take it.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.861
It's driving me crazy.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.281
- I've got to play that machine.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.281
- Here.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.868
- Use my silver dollar.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.868
- Oh, thanks, Steph.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.246
If we win any money

13:05.910 --> 13:08.246
I'll split it.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.415
Now, is the coast clear?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.209
- The coast is clear.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.209
- Alright.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.919
Yes. Hurry.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.130
Joey's gonna be back.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.174
(Stephanie)

13:17.171 --> 13:20.174
'That's one 7,

13:17.171 --> 13:20.174
that's two 7s.'

13:20.216 --> 13:22.636
That's three 7s!

13:22.677 --> 13:24.845
(Stephanie)

13:22.677 --> 13:24.845
'Yes! We won!'

13:25.764 --> 13:28.224
[bell ringing]

13:28.266 --> 13:30.435
[shreiking]

13:33.396 --> 13:36.149
Yes, we won. Yes. We won.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.319
Girls, what happened?

13:36.190 --> 13:39.319
Who won my $100,000 jackpot?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.404
- I did.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.404
- With my silver dollar.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.905
We'll split it three ways.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.198
Start jumping up and down.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.993
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:44.240 --> 13:46.993
- We won! We won!

13:47.034 --> 13:48.411
Yes! Yes! Yes!

13:48.453 --> 13:50.413
Hi, we're back live

13:48.453 --> 13:50.413
from Lake Tahoe

13:50.455 --> 13:52.873
where somebody has

13:50.455 --> 13:52.873
just won the big jackpot.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.084
So, come on, Perry, we're going

13:52.915 --> 13:55.084
back into the casino.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.211
Boy, this is what

13:55.126 --> 13:57.211
live television is all about.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.422
Dad, dad, Joey won

13:57.253 --> 13:59.422
the big jackpot.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.924
You hear that ladies and

13:59.464 --> 14:01.924
gentlemen? Joey just won.. Joey?

14:01.966 --> 14:04.051
Our Joey? My Joey? Oh, my God!

14:04.093 --> 14:07.930
Perry, Perry! Joey! Joey!

14:04.093 --> 14:07.930
Joey, you won the jackpot?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.516
- You won the jackpot?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.516
- Yes.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.643
Yes. Yes. Yes.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.102
Oh, sorry, Perry. Sorry.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.689
Joey, Joey, you've been broke

14:13.144 --> 14:15.689
your entire life.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.856
How does it feel

14:15.730 --> 14:17.856
to win $100,000?

14:17.898 --> 14:20.777
- Well--

14:17.898 --> 14:20.777
- It feels unbelievable.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.029
I mean, not that

14:20.819 --> 14:23.029
I would know personally

14:23.070 --> 14:26.700
but this has got to be the

14:23.070 --> 14:26.700
raddest day of Joey's life.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.076
I'm going to Disneyland.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.997
What the heck,

14:30.578 --> 14:32.997
I'm gonna buy it.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.709
Congratulations,

14:33.039 --> 14:35.709
congratulations.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.043
Congratulations!

Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.634
Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:46.386 --> 14:48.137
I'm really sorry

14:46.386 --> 14:48.137
about Danny running off

14:48.179 --> 14:49.681
with the camera like that.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.392
Well, that's alright.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.392
I'm having fun here with you.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.101
As a matter of fact

14:54.143 --> 14:56.937
why don't we continue our

14:54.143 --> 14:56.937
breakfast at dinner tonight?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.148
Oh, well, thanks, Todd,

14:56.979 --> 14:59.148
but I have a boyfriend.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.818
And, uh, I'm really crazy

14:59.190 --> 15:01.818
about him.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.654
He's a very lucky guy.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.115
I tell you what, why don't I

15:04.696 --> 15:08.115
take both of you out to dinner?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.868
That's very sweet of you.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.704
Great. It's a date. I'll have

15:09.909 --> 15:12.704
my driver pick you up at 7.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:15.707 --> 15:17.083
What the hell's going on here?

15:17.124 --> 15:18.959
You're going out to dinner

15:17.124 --> 15:18.959
with this joker?

15:19.001 --> 15:21.212
- Oh, Jess--

15:19.001 --> 15:21.212
- No, no. No, I understand.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.715
Good-looking guy comes

15:21.254 --> 15:23.715
into town, goes on your show.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.300
He hits on you, you're all over

15:23.757 --> 15:26.300
him like a cheap suit.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.344
I mean, is this guy really

15:26.342 --> 15:28.344
that big a deal?

15:28.386 --> 15:30.096
[crowd booing]

15:30.137 --> 15:31.931
Knock it off.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.267
- Jesse, please.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.267
- No, I mean..

15:34.308 --> 15:35.769
How would you like it

15:34.308 --> 15:35.769
if I hit on every

15:35.810 --> 15:39.313
incredibly gorgeous blond

15:35.810 --> 15:39.313
that walks by me?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.900
Excuse me.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.193
Hi, I'd like to see you tonight.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.612
You can cook me dinner

15:45.653 --> 15:46.905
I'll cook you breakfast

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
and in between, babe,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
we'll just cook.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.868
Get out of my face,

15:49.490 --> 15:51.868
you creep.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.456
Well, we're heading back

15:56.497 --> 16:00.042
to the stage

15:56.497 --> 16:00.042
and, huh, nobody's here.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.004
- We'll talk about this later.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.004
- We'll talk about this now.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.965
Oh, here they are.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.965
What a pleasant surprise.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.842
My brother-in-law Jesse.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.093
Right in the middle

16:07.884 --> 16:09.093
of the most important

16:09.135 --> 16:10.845
broadcast of my career.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.472
- Welcome, Jesse.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.472
- Thank you.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.765
How could you do this to me?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.391
This was supposed

16:13.807 --> 16:15.391
to be our weekend.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.477
[chuckles]

16:15.433 --> 16:17.477
Uh, Jess, could we have

16:15.433 --> 16:17.477
this discussion

16:17.518 --> 16:18.812
during the next commercial?

16:18.853 --> 16:20.480
No, we're talking

16:18.853 --> 16:20.480
about our relationship.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.898
It's much more important

16:20.521 --> 16:21.898
than some stupid talk show.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.650
[chuckles]

16:23.691 --> 16:26.235
This is my brother-in-law and

16:23.691 --> 16:26.235
I love him dearly. Security!

16:27.862 --> 16:29.572
Well, what's going through

16:27.862 --> 16:29.572
your mind, some guy--

16:29.614 --> 16:30.990
You're making

16:29.614 --> 16:30.990
a fool of yourself.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.952
Sit down, fun boy.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.913
Jesse, Todd is right, you're

16:33.993 --> 16:36.913
making a really big mistake.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.372
Oh, really? Good.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.082
Then this is the last mistake

16:38.414 --> 16:40.082
I make with you

16:40.124 --> 16:42.877
because this is it.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.877
We're breaking up.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.420
Well, fine.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.420
Then it's over.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.590
Well, fine, and you're looking

16:44.462 --> 16:47.590
at a free man.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.758
Oh!

16:51.010 --> 16:54.722
Well, you won't see

16:51.010 --> 16:54.722
that on a Gilligan's Island.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.813
With my share of the jackpot

17:01.855 --> 17:05.733
I'm gonna buy a ranch

17:01.855 --> 17:05.733
full of horses, a red Corvette.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.694
I'm gonna buy my own jet plane.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.404
That bus takes forever

17:07.735 --> 17:10.404
to get to school.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.325
Now, girls, when Mr. Fabulous

17:11.948 --> 17:14.325
comes in here to give me

17:14.367 --> 17:18.913
my check for a hundred grand,

17:14.367 --> 17:18.913
just let me do the talking.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.582
As long as you

17:18.955 --> 17:21.582
let<i> us</i> do the spending.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.211
Hey, hey, hey. Mr. Lucky.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.046
Oh, man, come with me

17:25.252 --> 17:27.046
into the casino

17:27.087 --> 17:28.840
and help me

17:27.087 --> 17:28.840
pick a slot machine.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.425
Let DJ pick it.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.425
She won the jackpot.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.803
Steph.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.680
DJ won?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.807
Joey, you let the girls gamble?

17:37.849 --> 17:41.352
No, I had nothing to do with it.

17:37.849 --> 17:41.352
I was getting a money bucket.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.814
You girls were gambling

17:41.394 --> 17:44.814
after I told you not to?

17:44.856 --> 17:48.275
I'm not happy

17:44.856 --> 17:48.275
about this at all.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.486
Would $10,000 cheer you up?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.742
You girls won

17:53.322 --> 17:55.742
that money illegally

17:55.783 --> 17:57.577
and you can't accept it.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.830
Well, there is a bright side

17:57.618 --> 18:00.830
to this. I can accept it.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.707
You didn't really win

18:00.872 --> 18:02.707
that money either.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.792
Well, no, not technically.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.669
But if the girls

18:04.834 --> 18:06.669
hadn't jumped in there

18:06.711 --> 18:09.005
the next pull

18:06.711 --> 18:09.005
would've been mine, and..

18:09.047 --> 18:12.550
Don't shake your head "no."

18:09.047 --> 18:12.550
I've got a case.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.261
Yes, I do. Read my head.

18:15.302 --> 18:19.599
Mr. Gladstone, just the

18:15.302 --> 18:19.599
gentleman I need to chat with.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.768
Well, before you give me

18:19.640 --> 18:21.768
my $100,000

18:21.809 --> 18:24.186
I'd like to tell you

18:21.809 --> 18:24.186
a funny story.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.398
You see, I was playing

18:24.228 --> 18:27.398
the machine and I stepped away

18:27.440 --> 18:31.611
for a minute, a second.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.611
Heck, a microsecond.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.281
Well, I told the girls here to

18:31.652 --> 18:35.281
guard my machine which they did

18:35.322 --> 18:37.157
by putting a silver dollar over

18:37.199 --> 18:41.788
the coin slot which accidentally

18:37.199 --> 18:41.788
fell into the coin slot.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.664
[laughing]

18:45.416 --> 18:48.335
I couldn't accept the money

18:45.416 --> 18:48.335
without clearing my conscience.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.089
But I feel great now,

18:48.377 --> 18:51.089
so lay it on me.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.552
- What's this?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.552
- A video cassette.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.972
Our security camera got

18:56.594 --> 18:58.972
a nice clean shot

18:59.013 --> 19:00.932
of the children gambling.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.475
You didn't come

19:00.974 --> 19:02.475
into the picture

19:02.516 --> 19:06.062
until many, many, many

19:02.516 --> 19:06.062
microseconds later.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.106
I'm not getting the money, am I?

19:08.188 --> 19:09.941
Mm, no.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.401
But you can keep

19:09.983 --> 19:12.401
the video cassette

19:12.443 --> 19:15.446
as a souvenir of not having won

19:12.443 --> 19:15.446
the jackpot here

19:15.488 --> 19:19.492
at the fabulous

19:15.488 --> 19:19.492
Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.579
Do you hate us, Joey?

19:23.621 --> 19:27.792
No. Don't be silly, girls.

19:23.621 --> 19:27.792
I love you very much.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.628
But we cost you $100,000.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.798
Is there any way

19:30.670 --> 19:33.798
we can make it up to you?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.050
No, I don't think so.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.805
Mom, I have never been

19:37.927 --> 19:40.805
so embarrassed in my life.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.473
I never wanna talk

19:40.847 --> 19:42.473
to Jesse again.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.558
He is the most obstinate,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.558
pig-headed..

19:44.600 --> 19:45.935
[knock on door]

19:44.600 --> 19:45.935
'Becky.'

19:45.977 --> 19:48.980
Oh, Mom, that's him.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.980
I gotta go.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.233
What am I doing?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.488
Talk. I'm listening.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.948
'There's a maid, a bellhop'

19:58.990 --> 20:01.534
'and some guy getting ice

19:58.990 --> 20:01.534
staring at me.'

20:03.077 --> 20:04.871
Since when does

20:03.077 --> 20:04.871
an audience bother you?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.998
Hey, hey, I just came by here

20:04.912 --> 20:06.998
to tell you something.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.333
It was not my fault

20:07.040 --> 20:09.333
and the fact that we broke up

20:09.375 --> 20:11.293
is all your fault.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.047
You're absolutely right, Jess.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.047
It is my fault.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.466
I met Todd Masters,

20:14.088 --> 20:17.466
I watched him eat scrambled eggs

20:17.508 --> 20:19.677
and then I did

20:17.508 --> 20:19.677
the only logical thing.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.261
I threw our whole relationship

20:19.719 --> 20:21.261
out the window.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.638
Oh, please, don't try

20:21.303 --> 20:22.638
to turn this around.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.015
You were the one

20:22.680 --> 20:24.015
who's going to dinner

20:24.057 --> 20:26.475
with this blow-dried

20:24.057 --> 20:26.475
side of beef.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.061
You don't even know

20:26.517 --> 20:28.061
what you're talking about.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.770
There you go shooting off--

20:29.812 --> 20:31.189
- I do know what I'm talking--

20:29.812 --> 20:31.189
- No, you don't what you're--

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
We've been going out

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
for six months

20:33.273 --> 20:35.735
some clown comes in town, and

20:33.273 --> 20:35.735
you're going to dinner with him?

20:35.776 --> 20:37.195
- Yes, you were!

20:35.776 --> 20:37.195
- No, I wasn't!

20:37.236 --> 20:40.698
Yes, you were!

20:37.236 --> 20:40.698
Let me tell you something.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.995
- No, I wasn't!

20:44.785 --> 20:45.995
- Yes, you were!

20:46.037 --> 20:47.621
- No, I wasn't!

20:46.037 --> 20:47.621
- Yes, you were!

20:47.663 --> 20:48.998
If you think

20:47.663 --> 20:48.998
kissing me is gonna solve this

20:49.040 --> 20:50.750
then you've been watching too

20:49.040 --> 20:50.750
many old movies.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.169
And it just so happens that

20:50.791 --> 20:53.169
the blow-dried side of beef

20:53.211 --> 20:55.254
and I were gonna have dinner

20:53.211 --> 20:55.254
tonight with you.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.672
And if you didn't lose

20:55.295 --> 20:56.672
your temper and act like

20:56.714 --> 20:57.965
such a jealous maniac I could've

20:58.007 --> 21:00.259
told you that

20:58.007 --> 21:00.259
in the first place.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.637
Whoa, I'm a jerk.

21:05.681 --> 21:09.268
So what you're saying

21:05.681 --> 21:09.268
is that, uh..

21:09.309 --> 21:11.771
...that I broke up

21:09.309 --> 21:11.771
with you for no reason.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.940
Well, look who just woke up.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.691
Well, I'm sorry, Becky,

21:13.981 --> 21:15.691
but that's the way I am, okay?

21:15.733 --> 21:16.901
That's how I live my life.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.360
If I feel something

21:16.943 --> 21:18.360
I go with it.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.071
I was feeling jealous,

21:18.402 --> 21:20.071
so I acted jealous.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.906
- Tell me about it.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.906
- Oh, come on.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.532
I'm not the only one who acts

21:21.948 --> 21:23.532
jealous in this relationship.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.910
Oh, when have I

21:23.574 --> 21:25.910
ever been jealous?

21:25.952 --> 21:27.411
Uh, how about when I hit

21:25.952 --> 21:27.411
on that waitress?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.413
For a split second,

21:27.453 --> 21:29.413
right before she punched me

21:29.455 --> 21:31.373
admit it, you were jealous.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.833
Okay, maybe for a split second.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.002
Okay, so how does it feel?

21:35.044 --> 21:36.963
It was the worst

21:35.044 --> 21:36.963
split second of my life.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.423
That's what I've been feeling

21:37.004 --> 21:39.423
since I got up here, Becky.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.175
I mean, this was gonna be

21:39.465 --> 21:41.175
the most romantic

21:41.217 --> 21:42.593
most perfect weekend.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.137
I was gonna tell you

21:42.635 --> 21:44.137
that I love you.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.388
- I love you too.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.388
- I had it all planned out.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.848
Now that we were gonna

21:46.430 --> 21:47.848
take a nice walk

21:47.890 --> 21:49.809
by the lake, under the stars..

21:49.850 --> 21:52.728
Jesse, did you hear

21:49.850 --> 21:52.728
what I said?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.689
Yeah, you said

21:52.770 --> 21:55.689
"I love you too."

21:58.025 --> 22:00.569
- You love me?

21:58.025 --> 22:00.569
- Yes.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.905
And I love you.

22:02.947 --> 22:07.076
Whoa! That means

22:02.947 --> 22:07.076
we're in love! Yes!

22:07.118 --> 22:08.744
It's about time, Becky,

22:07.118 --> 22:08.744
I got to tell you something.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.330
I've been in love with you since

22:08.786 --> 22:11.330
the first day I saw you.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.457
We're in love!

22:13.499 --> 22:14.792
We gotta do something

22:13.499 --> 22:14.792
about this.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.127
We have to be together

22:14.834 --> 22:16.127
all the time.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.253
I never, I never want

22:16.169 --> 22:17.253
to go through

22:17.295 --> 22:18.378
something like this again.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.672
I wanna know

22:18.420 --> 22:19.672
that you're mine.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.758
Now we're in Nevada,

22:19.713 --> 22:22.758
let's get married.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.888
Jess, do you know

22:26.053 --> 22:27.888
what you just said?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.641
Yeah-h. We're in Nevada, let's

22:27.930 --> 22:30.641
get married right now. Today.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.395
I don't know what to say.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.108
Rebecca Donaldson..

22:41.359 --> 22:43.361
I love you.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.490
And if anything

22:43.403 --> 22:46.490
has ever been right

22:46.532 --> 22:48.075
it's you and me.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.127
Will you marry me?

22:58.961 --> 23:01.088
Jesse, this is so..

23:08.095 --> 23:09.555
Yes.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.641
Have mercy.
