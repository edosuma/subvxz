00:07.120 --> 00:11.290
The battle for a $500,000 prize.

00:11.290 --> 00:15.990
Audrey, da'vonne and shelli
didn't wast waste any time

00:15.990 --> 00:18.990
forming all girl alliance.

00:18.990 --> 00:22.120
>> Oh, my God.

00:22.120 --> 00:22.990
Female power, baby.

00:22.990 --> 00:26.120
Watch out where boys.

00:26.120 --> 00:30.990
>> Announcer: After learning the
battle of the block was back.

00:30.990 --> 00:34.290
>> Julie: You could go from
being head of household to being

00:34.290 --> 00:36.990
evicted in the same week.

00:36.990 --> 00:37.990
>> Wow.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.700
Announcer: James became the
first head of household of the

00:39.700 --> 00:40.290
summer.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.830
>> I told you guys I wasn't
going nowhere.

00:42.830 --> 00:45.950
>> Announcer: But before the
tomato juice could dry, Julie

00:45.950 --> 00:49.540
unleashed the second twist of
the night.

00:49.540 --> 00:51.990
>> Julie: The bb will unleash
new twists into the game

00:51.990 --> 00:53.990
throughout the summer.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.000
>> What?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.830
Announcer: Then six new
houseguests entered the game.

00:58.830 --> 01:02.990
Among them, the cashier, the
South beach hottie, the geek,

01:02.990 --> 01:06.990
the poker player, and the
dentist.

01:06.990 --> 01:09.990
>> Welcome to "big brother"!

01:09.990 --> 01:13.410
Announcer: A surprise guest
officially kicked off the bb

01:13.410 --> 01:14.990
takeover.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.990
>> Hi, I'mfill kogen from the
amazing race.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.950
I am taking over "big brother"
this week.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.990
That's why I'm here.

01:23.990 --> 01:27.990
>> Announcer: He put up two "the
amazing racers."

01:27.990 --> 01:31.990
>> I'm hoping it can make them
an easy target.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.990
>> Announcer: At the second head
of household competition --

01:34.990 --> 01:35.990
(cheers)
-- Jason proved he was out of

01:35.990 --> 01:37.990
this world.

01:37.990 --> 01:43.990
>> I just won the second hoh
comp of bb17.

01:43.990 --> 01:47.990
>> Announcer: Before the night
was through, Phil teased the

01:47.990 --> 01:53.990
next part of his takeover.

01:53.990 --> 01:55.990
>> With risk sometimes comes
reward.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.990
More on that another day.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.950
>> Announcer: Which four
houseguests will be nominated

01:59.950 --> 02:00.990
for eviction?

02:00.990 --> 02:03.540
And which two will be saved in
the battle of the block

02:03.540 --> 02:03.990
competition?

02:03.990 --> 02:07.990
Plus --
how will bb takeover twist up

02:07.990 --> 02:08.990
the game tonight?

02:08.990 --> 02:12.290
Find out rye now on "big
brother"!

02:12.290 --> 02:15.990
(Cheers)
Captioning funded by CBS

02:51.990 --> 02:52.540
>> good night out there.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.990
(Laughter)
(Screams)

02:55.990 --> 02:58.990
>> What?

02:58.990 --> 03:01.540
If I get $5,000?

03:01.540 --> 03:03.990
I'm a super "big brother"
fan, so I already know this is

03:03.990 --> 03:06.000
going to be something good for
me in this game.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.990
So I'm like, all right, Phil,
come on, let me know what I just

03:10.990 --> 03:11.990
won.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.290
>> More on that later?

03:13.290 --> 03:14.990
That's it.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.990
>> If I were a professional
gambler, which I am, I would bet

03:16.990 --> 03:22.990
on the fact that it's going to
mean something good for me.

03:22.990 --> 03:23.990
>> I'm pretty excited.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.830
We have all these new
houseguests.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.990
There's so much going on, of
course, there's a new twist that

03:29.990 --> 03:30.410
is coming.

03:30.410 --> 03:34.000
I have n no idea what to expect.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.990
What's going on, Julie chen?

03:35.990 --> 03:38.990
>> Me and scrams are probably
going to the "the amazing race."

03:38.990 --> 03:39.950
(Laughter).

03:39.950 --> 03:39.990
>> Pack your bags.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.540
You're going.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.990
>> I'm going to get cleaned up.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.990
Was hoeing that Jackie
would have pulled off the first

03:47.990 --> 03:50.990
head of household victory, but
that didn't happen.

03:50.990 --> 03:55.990
So right now it's important for
both of us to figure out a way

03:55.990 --> 04:00.990
to decrease the target that's on
our backs.

04:00.990 --> 04:08.410
♪
>> tell me.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.000
Bro' code number three.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.990
Austin is my male version of
Romeo and Juliet.

04:14.990 --> 04:15.990
He's multidimensional.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.990
He can go from being a romantic
to a bro'.

04:17.990 --> 04:21.410
Austin is the yin to my Yang.

04:21.410 --> 04:24.990
>> Bro' code number 75: A bro'
must never leave his house

04:24.990 --> 04:32.990

protein bar.

Number 76, other bro' is not
intimidated by other bro'.

>> A bro' has long hair, he will
do everything in his power to

04:38.990 --> 04:41.990
prevent his other bro' from
cutting his long hair.

04:41.990 --> 04:47.990
>> Unless it's for a movie role,
in which case bro' must vote.

04:47.990 --> 04:49.120
>> Yes.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.990
Even if bro' has girlfriend,
if he sees a girl walk by, bro'

04:51.990 --> 04:52.990
must look down.

04:52.990 --> 04:56.990
If bro' talks about getting
questionable tattoo, other bro'

04:56.990 --> 05:00.990
will always remind his bro' that
it could be a mistake.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.990
>> We should be coming up
with --

05:03.990 --> 05:06.990
>> oh, man.

05:06.990 --> 05:07.990
Kay.

05:07.990 --> 05:12.990
Who wants to see our hoh room?

05:12.990 --> 05:14.990
Come on.

05:14.990 --> 05:19.990
>> Yay!

05:19.990 --> 05:23.990
Zm z.

05:23.990 --> 05:24.830
(Screams).

05:24.830 --> 05:26.990
>> Oh!

05:26.990 --> 05:31.290
Moving into the hoh room is a
big change from my north's

05:31.290 --> 05:31.990
basement.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.990
Sorry, mom, but I live upstairs
now.

05:33.990 --> 05:42.700
>> I am so jealous right now.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.950
With the battle of the block,
it's very important I establish

05:44.950 --> 05:48.990
some kind of foundation with the
other hoh because at any time I

05:48.990 --> 05:52.990
could be dethroned and I could
be on the block myself.

05:52.990 --> 05:54.540
>> Oh, there's two rooms?

05:54.540 --> 05:54.990
Wow.

05:54.990 --> 05:57.950
Oh, this is cool, man.

05:57.950 --> 05:58.990
This is so awesome.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.990
Ey even gave me pink
headphones.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.990
They know what's up.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.990
>> First thing I see in the
bathroom is the bathtub.

06:05.990 --> 06:10.990
I automatically think of some
babes in there.

06:10.990 --> 06:11.990
>> This awesome.

06:11.990 --> 06:14.990
Even though your boy didn't
win the hoh, I'm the king of the

06:14.990 --> 06:16.540
castle.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.990
It's time for jace to take over
this room and make the honeys

06:18.990 --> 06:19.540
mine.

06:19.540 --> 06:19.990
>> Get out of here.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.120
You need to get the girls in
here.

06:21.120 --> 06:30.990
>> Okay.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.990
Dude, it's been a crazy day.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.990
We haven't really had a
chance --

06:36.990 --> 06:39.990
>> to like --
so it's actually good we're

06:39.990 --> 06:40.990
hohs together.

06:40.990 --> 06:41.950
>> Yep.

06:41.950 --> 06:43.950
So we can definitely think
together.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.120
I haven't had any time with
James.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.700
So us being alone in the hoh
room is my one and first

06:48.700 --> 06:51.990
opportunity to really discuss
game, discuss who we are, and

06:51.990 --> 06:54.700
how we can work together in this
game.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.410
>> So you know more about your
first group.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.950
>> I do.

06:58.950 --> 07:01.990
You probably know just as
much my group as well because

07:01.990 --> 07:04.120
it's been so chaos.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.990
Do you have an idea already
or --

07:06.990 --> 07:07.990
>> I don't have an idea.

07:07.990 --> 07:08.990
That's the thing in right.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.950
>> I'm totally lost right now.

07:10.950 --> 07:14.990
I was trying to see where your
head was at, if there was

07:14.990 --> 07:16.990
somebody --
>> I guess a specific target.

07:16.990 --> 07:17.990
Right.

07:17.990 --> 07:20.830
Steven, me and him had like
no interaction.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.990
>> But someone like him, you've
got to watch him.

07:22.990 --> 07:26.290
>> Something about the dentist
guy, it didn't say dentist to

07:26.290 --> 07:26.990
me.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.990
>> Yeah, he's a little weird
too.

07:28.990 --> 07:35.990
>> Den fist guy is probably
hiding more than Steven is.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.990
He's from Scranton,
Pennsylvania, too, that's where

07:38.990 --> 07:41.700
that "office" show is base.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.990
If anyone's got a fabricated
story, I would think it would be

07:44.990 --> 07:45.990
him.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.990
>> This is not a good social
game.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.990
>> He's like everyone's best
friend already.

07:49.990 --> 07:55.990
>> I've played this competition
with him and he's a beast.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.990
>> My biggest threat is these
big guys I might have a harder

07:57.990 --> 07:59.990
time connecting with.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.990
>> Yeah.

08:01.990 --> 08:05.410
I would not want to put them
up from jump because then I'm

08:05.410 --> 08:09.990
just setting myself up for the
worst game play ever.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.830
>> It's hard.

08:10.830 --> 08:11.700
It's so crazy.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.990
But the girls --
>> it always takes them longer

08:15.990 --> 08:17.990
for their mask to slip a little
bit.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.990
All the girls are innocent right
now.

08:19.990 --> 08:23.540
>> They're not.

08:23.540 --> 08:26.700
Who would have thought me and
Jason would be working together.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.990
This could definitely benefit
the both of us right now.

08:28.990 --> 08:40.120
>> So it's like --
I don't know.

08:40.120 --> 08:54.830
I'm clueless, like -- I'm cool
with James and Jason?

08:54.830 --> 08:57.540
>> That's great.

08:57.540 --> 08:58.410
Yeah, I don't know.

08:58.410 --> 09:01.120
I haven't talked to anybody, but
it's so weird.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.990
>> The relationship Jackie and I
have coming into the "big

09:03.990 --> 09:07.990
brother" house is kind of a
shaky one.

09:07.990 --> 09:13.000
I think Jackie wanted more once
the race was over, but it wasn't

09:13.000 --> 09:21.990
going to happen.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.990
I knew with me and you coming in
like us being partners on the

09:24.990 --> 09:27.990
"the amazing race," that we were
going to be -- I don't want to

09:27.990 --> 09:28.990
get all nervous.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.990
>> Like they've been working
together this whole time.

09:30.990 --> 09:35.990
>> I just feel like, it's an
easy way for them to -- we're

09:35.990 --> 09:39.990
just nominating you guys because
you guys had a cool experience.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.990
You guys already did --
>> yeah.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.990
It could be something easy
like that.

09:43.990 --> 09:47.990
My strategy is very simple,
create distance between us so

09:47.990 --> 09:51.950
that the other houseguests look
at us as individuals in the game

09:51.950 --> 09:53.950
and not as a pair.

09:53.950 --> 09:58.990
I just don't want to make it
seem like a pairing.

09:58.990 --> 09:59.830
>> Uh-huh.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.120
Nless we absolutely have to.

10:02.120 --> 10:02.990
Sorry to interrupt.

10:02.990 --> 10:09.990
No, no, sit down.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.990
My pickup line is really bad.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.000
You want to make out?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.990
(Laughter)
>> Great pickup line.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.000
Like straight and to the point.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
>> Mine are really bad.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.990
One is, is your dad Baker?

10:20.990 --> 10:23.990
Or are you just a cutie pie?

10:23.990 --> 10:27.990
>> Oh!

10:27.990 --> 10:30.990
Wait, are those space pants?

10:30.990 --> 10:31.990
Are they what?

10:31.990 --> 10:33.990
Ose space pants?

10:33.990 --> 10:37.990
Your butt's out of this world.

10:37.990 --> 10:38.990
(Cheers).

10:38.990 --> 10:46.990
>> Oh!

10:46.990 --> 10:54.990
♪ Get ready for a takeover ♪
(Cheers)

10:54.990 --> 10:55.990
>> Bb takeover.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.990
I have no idea what "big
brother" has in store.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.540
All I know is game is on.

11:02.540 --> 11:03.990
>> Hello, houseguests, I'm back.

11:03.990 --> 11:11.410
Y!

11:11.410 --> 11:13.990
Phil: I teased your risky
move could pay off and it's

11:13.990 --> 11:15.830
about to.

11:15.830 --> 11:16.990
On "the amazing race" we have
the fast forward and that allows

11:16.990 --> 11:20.990
a team to skip all pass and go
directly to the pit stop for

11:20.990 --> 11:21.990
that leg of the race.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.540
>> Oh, my gosh.

11:23.540 --> 11:28.990
Phil: So inspired by that, I
am introducing a twist called

11:28.990 --> 11:31.990
the bb fast forward.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.990
>> Oh, no.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.990
Phil: Da'vonne and Vanessa,
as of this moment, your game

11:35.990 --> 11:38.990
will fast forward to next week.

11:38.990 --> 11:39.990
(Applause)
That's right.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.990
You can't be nominated or
evicted this week.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.990
(Cheers)
Sound good?

11:45.990 --> 11:46.990
>> I'm psyched!

11:46.990 --> 11:47.990
I'm chillin'.

11:47.990 --> 11:50.990
I couldn't feel any better, like
nobody in this house can touch

11:50.990 --> 11:53.950
me at least for this week.

11:53.950 --> 11:54.990
>> Phil: That's not all.

11:54.990 --> 11:59.000
Da'vonne and Vanessa, you each
get to take one houseguest with

11:59.000 --> 11:59.990
you.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.990
(Cheers)
>> Wow.

12:01.990 --> 12:05.540
Phil: Just like you, they
cannot be nominated or evicted.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.410
So their games will also fast
forward to next week.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.990
>> That's pretty cool.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.540
Oh, my heart dropped down to
my toes.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.990
My job was just to sit back and
be pretty and be safe this week.

12:16.990 --> 12:19.990
Now I have to make a choice.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.990
>> Phil: You have 30 minutes to
make your decision.

12:21.990 --> 12:22.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.990
Phil: And with that, my
takeover is complete.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.990
>> Oh!

12:27.990 --> 12:28.990
(Cheers).

12:28.990 --> 12:29.950
>> Phil: Good luck.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.990
(Applause)
>> I'm going to go in the

12:32.990 --> 12:35.290
hammock room and luckily talk to
everyone, if you guys want to

12:35.290 --> 12:35.990
come in quickly.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.410
>> Sure.

12:37.410 --> 12:38.990
All right.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.990
>> Being a poker player, you
know how it make the best of the

12:41.990 --> 12:42.990
cards that are dealt.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.990
What I'm trying to do is pick
someone who I think is very

12:45.990 --> 12:49.000
likely to win hoh the following
week and who can promise to keep

12:49.000 --> 12:56.990
me safe.

12:56.990 --> 12:57.000
>> So I like you.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.990
I like you too.

12:57.990 --> 12:59.410
Totally trust you.

12:59.410 --> 13:00.990
Rust you too.

13:00.990 --> 13:02.540
My decision is probably going
to come down to who I feel can

13:02.540 --> 13:03.990
offer me something in return.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.990
So it would be someone who is a
strong competitor.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.990
>> I'm extremely mentally well.

13:08.990 --> 13:12.990
So if there's any mental
challenges, I'm really strong.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.000
I would never put you.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.990
>> The only thing --
I can help you you can help

13:20.990 --> 13:22.410
me.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.990
>> I would say the only reason I
might not consider it is just

13:23.990 --> 13:26.990
because I feel like you're -- I
feel like you have zero chance

13:26.990 --> 13:27.990
of going home.

13:27.990 --> 13:30.120
You're pretty much the most
likable guy on earth.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.990
There's no way you're the person
going home.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.000
There's no way.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.290
I want to pick someone who has a
different skill set than my own.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.990
Since my biggest drawback in the
game is physically, I'm looking

13:38.990 --> 13:42.990
for someone who brings a lot
physically to the table.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.990
>> We have different groups of
people we are friends with,

13:45.990 --> 13:47.410
which is good.

13:47.410 --> 13:51.990
>> I feel like we could work the
side of the girls and I can work

13:51.990 --> 13:52.990
the bro' mance guys.

13:52.990 --> 13:53.990
We separate what comes together.

13:53.990 --> 14:02.830
>> I feel like it's a good
combination.

14:02.830 --> 14:05.990
>> Me and you Audrey have an
alliance, keep things kind of

14:05.990 --> 14:06.990
under wraps.

14:06.990 --> 14:11.990
I don't want to put you up
either because I don't want to

14:11.990 --> 14:13.990
kind of let anyone know what's
going on.

14:13.990 --> 14:18.950
>> I don't see why anyone she
picks is going to be more or

14:18.950 --> 14:21.990
less of a target so why isn't
she trying to safety one of

14:21.990 --> 14:24.990
us? -- Save one of us.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.990
>> Even though shelli and Audrey
and I are in an alliance, I

14:27.990 --> 14:31.990
don't want to choose them
because I'm not trying to blow

14:31.990 --> 14:33.290
up my spot.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.990
I don't want to be vulnerable.

14:34.990 --> 14:35.990
>> You're not.

14:35.990 --> 14:38.540
So at this point, I'm going
around and I'm asking everybody,

14:38.540 --> 14:45.950
you know, if you want safety,
where's your head at?

14:45.950 --> 14:52.990
>> James has been avoiding me.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.990
Here's the problem.

14:54.990 --> 14:55.700
Okay.

14:55.700 --> 15:03.000
You give off a Ian vibe.

15:03.000 --> 15:03.990
Really?

15:03.990 --> 15:03.990
A little bit.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.990
Mix and mingle.

15:05.990 --> 15:09.990
>> Are people threatened by me?

15:09.990 --> 15:11.410
Little bit.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.990
Let me make sure that I'm going
to be safe, like give and you

15:14.990 --> 15:16.410
shall receive.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.990
What you going to give me so I
can give you the safety?

15:18.990 --> 15:19.990
>> I'm a tough competitor.

15:19.990 --> 15:20.990
I don't want to lose.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.990
I'm in it to win it.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.990
I definitely don't want to be
the first one eliminated.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.990
So if you take me with you, I
will definitely keep you safe.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.990
The one thing I have in this
game is my word and I will not

15:31.990 --> 15:33.000
break that at all.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.830
So if you take me with you, I'm
going to get that next hoh and

15:35.830 --> 15:36.700
you're safe with me.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.410
>> Okay.

15:38.410 --> 15:39.990
What's up, ladies?

15:39.990 --> 15:40.990
I have one question for.

15:40.990 --> 15:41.990
You okay.

15:41.990 --> 15:44.990
What are you thinking if you
were to nominate somebody, who

15:44.990 --> 15:45.990
were you thinking?

15:45.990 --> 15:47.990
>> I'd go after the guys, right?

15:47.990 --> 15:48.990
The guys.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.000
Are you really a dentist?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.990
Oh, yeah, I'm really a
dentist.

15:52.990 --> 15:53.990
>> You're really a dentist?

15:53.990 --> 15:55.830
Eah.

15:55.830 --> 16:02.990
You want me to pull my retainers
out and prove it right now?

16:02.990 --> 16:03.990
>> Okay, okay.

16:03.990 --> 16:31.990
(Laughter)
>> I've chosen to save

16:31.990 --> 16:33.990
Liz.

16:33.990 --> 16:38.990
Not only am I safe from
elimination but I'm safe from

16:38.990 --> 16:39.950
nomination.

16:39.950 --> 16:40.290
>> I'm not surprised.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.950
But I'm going to act like it.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.990
I'm going to be as loyal as I
can be with Vanessa.

16:43.990 --> 16:46.950
But if there's someone else I
should be moving forward with,

16:46.950 --> 16:47.990
I'm going to have to part ways.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.990
(Applause)
>> The only person who offered

16:49.990 --> 16:52.990
me something that was worming me
thinking twice about was Liz.

16:52.990 --> 16:59.990
She problemised me freedom if
she gets hoh.

16:59.990 --> 17:01.990
>> Da, why aren't you picking
one of us?

17:01.990 --> 17:03.950
We all said we were sticking
together.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.000
Why aren't you picking me and
Audrey?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So I'm just not really sure
about this.

17:15.990 --> 17:22.000
[Phone dialing]
>> Can I call you right now?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.990
Sure, dude.

17:23.990 --> 17:27.990
Give me a call right now.

17:27.990 --> 17:28.410
Yeah.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.990
Not much, man, just shellin'.

17:30.990 --> 17:33.990
Can you shell right now?

17:33.990 --> 17:33.990
Shell, no.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.410
What's the problem?

17:35.410 --> 17:36.990
I'll shell schocked right
now.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.990
>> I wasn't expecting to bro'
down so fast but the second I

17:39.990 --> 17:42.990
met Austin, I knew he was going
to be a great asset to my game.

17:42.990 --> 17:44.120
>> It's shelltown.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.410
Shelltown.

17:46.410 --> 17:47.990
, shelltown.

17:47.990 --> 17:48.700
.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.990
It's shelltown.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.120
Shelltown.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.290
That's it.

17:52.290 --> 17:55.990
Welcome to shelltown, baby.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.830
Shelltown population 2.

17:57.830 --> 17:59.120
Meeting Jason here is a dream
come true.

17:59.120 --> 18:04.990
Not only is he a fellow bro',
but he's a huge target.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.410
Because of his loud mouth.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.990
And he will definitely take the
fall before I do.

18:08.990 --> 18:17.000
>> Welcome to shelltown.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.120
Oh.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.990
I didn't expect you to be
here.

18:19.990 --> 18:32.120
(Laughter)
>> If anyone comes in I'll just

18:32.120 --> 18:38.990
start talking about oh, yeah
yeah, I've got a raccoon.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.000
>> Do you have kids?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.990
No, but I was married.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.290
You're lying.

18:43.290 --> 18:43.990
No.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.990
How long?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.000
A year and a half.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.540
She is 33.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.990
She did mention she was
divorced, but kind of been into

18:49.990 --> 18:53.990
the wonder woman and I'm just
enjoying getting to know her a

18:53.990 --> 18:55.410
little better.

18:55.410 --> 18:56.990
>> That's my little big story.

18:56.990 --> 18:58.990
Tell me your big story.

18:58.990 --> 19:01.990
>> I talk to my mom every day.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.990
I talk to her about everything.

19:04.990 --> 19:06.990
>> Mama you raised that boy
right, because this self-did ill

19:06.990 --> 19:09.990
in the type of guy that I would
want to spend some time with and

19:09.990 --> 19:10.990
get to know.

19:10.990 --> 19:14.290
Yeah, he's a lot younger Anthony
I am, but that doesn't really

19:14.290 --> 19:17.990
matter because I feel very safe
with him and I really feel he's

19:17.990 --> 19:26.000
someone I can trust in this
game.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.830
>> Anything I tell you you
cannot say to anybody.

19:30.830 --> 19:33.540
>> I trust you.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.990
'M not going to mention it
or repeat it.

19:35.990 --> 19:46.990
>> When we go like animals --
(Laughter)

19:46.990 --> 19:50.990
>> So, um, shelli's making me
really nervous.

19:50.990 --> 19:56.990
I feel like she's -- she might
have to be on the outer ring of

19:56.990 --> 19:59.950
the alliance, make her still
think she's a part of it.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.120
>> At an arm's length.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.410
Shelli's relationship with
Clay is a problem, because she's

20:04.410 --> 20:07.990
not going to stay solid to the
girls' alliance.

20:07.990 --> 20:13.950
She's more this tred in kissing,
touching, hugging, rubbing than

20:13.950 --> 20:16.000
she is than getting to the end
and getting a check.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.990
>> I feel really good and Jason
being hoh.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.120
>> Oh, yes, for sure.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.990
Jason and I are bonded by
culture.

20:27.990 --> 20:32.990
If someone was going to win that
hoh, it needed to be him to

20:32.990 --> 20:39.990
really secure myself with at
least one of the hohs this

20:39.990 --> 20:40.990
week.

20:40.990 --> 20:41.990
>> He wants to go big target.

20:41.990 --> 20:42.990
Like who?

20:42.990 --> 20:49.990
I'm just so worried about
those guys, like the core.

20:49.990 --> 20:53.990
>> What is that boy's name with
the hair?

20:53.990 --> 20:54.990
>> Austin.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.990
And jace has an
alliance.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.990
>> And jace, I don't trust him
at all.

21:00.990 --> 21:04.990
>> This is the perfect
opportunity for jace to be

21:04.990 --> 21:10.990
eliminated because he is a
beast, and that's an issue.

21:10.990 --> 21:16.990
Da' and I definitely have to
fill in these hohs and make

21:16.990 --> 21:24.990
sure we can get them on our
side.

21:24.990 --> 21:26.990
>> So how was it down here last
night?

21:26.990 --> 21:27.410
>> Good.

21:27.410 --> 21:30.990
Yeah, it was good.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.990
I actually had a conversation
with James last night.

21:35.990 --> 21:39.990
We were both thinking lot ofs of
different stuff.

21:39.990 --> 21:42.990
We're sort of waiting for people
to hang themself.

21:42.990 --> 21:45.990
But I don't think that you have
any reason to be worried.

21:45.990 --> 21:50.950
>> He didn't bring me up at all?

21:50.950 --> 21:58.990
I thought of jace.

21:58.990 --> 22:00.950
-- Brought up jace to him.

22:00.950 --> 22:06.540
That's why the people who is
going to win the hohs.

22:06.540 --> 22:09.990
If you want to be the hoh, you
can't be here because you're

22:09.990 --> 22:12.990
going to be losing to him.

22:12.990 --> 22:20.410
>> It looks like Jason and I are
completely on the same page.

22:20.410 --> 22:21.000
Jace, bro'.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Peace.

22:33.990 --> 22:33.990
>> You good?

22:33.990 --> 22:33.990
Yeah.

22:33.990 --> 22:40.990
I'm good.

22:40.990 --> 22:43.990
>> I would really love to work
with da' in this game so I'm

22:43.990 --> 22:44.990
trying to get in tight with her.

22:44.990 --> 22:48.990
She's playing a really smart
game in how she's staying quiet.

22:48.990 --> 22:51.830
She's being very observant and
it's the type of alliance people

22:51.830 --> 22:54.990
wouldn't expect.

22:54.990 --> 22:59.990
>> I don't think it will be a
problem.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.990
>> Is there anything I can do
for you?

23:01.990 --> 23:01.990
>> No.

23:01.990 --> 23:04.990
I'm okay.

23:04.990 --> 23:07.000
>> If you ever need anything,
please, like, I want to help you

23:07.000 --> 23:08.990
in any way I can.

23:08.990 --> 23:10.830
>> Thank you, honey.

23:10.830 --> 23:11.990
I love you.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.950
Ooh, I'm sorry.

23:12.950 --> 23:13.120
>> What did you say?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.990
Oh, I didn't say anything.

23:14.990 --> 23:25.700
Okay.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.990
Want me to lock it?

23:26.990 --> 23:30.990
No, I can see him coming up
before he even gets here.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.540
>> Oh, right.

23:32.540 --> 23:36.990
You don't have to worry about
being nominated this week or

23:36.990 --> 23:38.990
backdoored or a replacement
nominee.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.290
You're a competitor and I would
definitely like to see me and

23:41.290 --> 23:45.990
you and da'.

23:45.990 --> 23:47.410
We just just talking about it.

23:47.410 --> 23:57.990
>> Okay.

23:57.990 --> 23:58.290
My man.

23:58.290 --> 23:59.990
Right here is a good vibe.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.410
Yeah.

24:01.410 --> 24:01.990
Solid team.

24:01.990 --> 24:02.990
You know what I mean?

24:02.990 --> 24:03.990
It's unique.

24:03.990 --> 24:05.990
This is about as diverse as it
can get.

24:05.990 --> 24:09.990
>> So Audrey and I are already
working together, but Jason and

24:09.990 --> 24:12.990
James are in power so why not
team up with the people in

24:12.990 --> 24:13.700
power?

24:13.700 --> 24:14.990
Even if it's just this week?

24:14.990 --> 24:16.700
We can solidify something.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.990
>> That's why this is brilliant.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.990
Have you guys even discussed
like your --

24:21.990 --> 24:22.990
>> not really.

24:22.990 --> 24:25.990
Let me tell you who we have a
problem with is jace.

24:25.990 --> 24:25.990
>> Yeah.

24:25.990 --> 24:29.990
Jace is a beast.

24:29.990 --> 24:30.990
Ackdoor situation
unfortunately.

24:30.990 --> 24:32.990
>> Yeah, we cannot throw him on
the block.

24:32.990 --> 24:33.990
>> Right.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.990
Jace cannot compete for
battle of the block, and he

24:35.990 --> 24:36.990
cannot compete for veto.

24:36.990 --> 24:40.540
You can't give him two
opportunities to save himself.

24:40.540 --> 24:47.990
The only way we can get rid of
him is the back door.

24:47.990 --> 24:48.990
>> Everyone's lovin' him.

24:48.990 --> 24:50.950
I don't think everyone's
lovin' him.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.990
>> If it's going to work we're
going to need enough votes to

24:52.990 --> 25:03.990
get him out of here.

25:03.990 --> 25:06.990
>> I want to take as many
pictures as possible.

25:06.990 --> 25:09.000
>> So the plan right now is to
back door jace.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.290
In order to make this work, I
got to recruit some pawns.

25:12.290 --> 25:13.120
I got to go fishing.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.990
I got to throw some lines out
there right now.

25:17.990 --> 25:19.990
Hopefully, I'll get a bite.

25:19.990 --> 25:21.120
>> Do you know what you're
thinking?

25:21.120 --> 25:24.990
>> I'm thinking that you look
really amazing in a bikini.

25:24.990 --> 25:24.990
>> Yeah?

25:24.990 --> 25:26.990
.

25:26.990 --> 25:31.990
But with that being said, I can
honestly say that you are not

25:31.990 --> 25:32.990
the target this week.

25:32.990 --> 25:33.990
>> Okay.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.990
There's a backdoor plan for
somebody.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.990
>> Okay.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.990
But ultimately for the back
door to work, we can't put our

25:40.990 --> 25:43.540
primary target up.

25:43.540 --> 25:48.990
Because she or he is too strong
of a competitor to give him two

25:48.990 --> 25:50.990
chances or her to get off the
block.

25:50.990 --> 25:51.990
>> Right.

25:51.990 --> 25:53.990
I'm not saying we're
nominating to you be on the

25:53.990 --> 25:54.000
block.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I just want you to be prepared.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.990
>> I'm here to play the game.

25:57.990 --> 25:57.990
Know.

25:57.990 --> 25:58.990
And I'll do it.

25:58.990 --> 26:07.990
I'm not scared.

26:07.990 --> 26:09.990
>> The veto is going to be more
important.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.990
>> So if you find yourself up
there really don't freak out.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.990
Out of anyone this week that can
find themselves up there, you're

26:15.990 --> 26:16.990
going to be okay.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.990
Because everyone's going to say,
why?

26:19.990 --> 26:21.990
What's Johnny done?

26:21.990 --> 26:23.990
>> Jason asked me to be a pawn.

26:23.990 --> 26:26.290
I don't really feel comfortable
with it but I'm going to roll

26:26.290 --> 26:27.990
with it and see what happens.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.990
>> If I'm up there, do I want to
win?

26:29.990 --> 26:31.990
>> I think anyone that's up
there wants to win.

26:31.990 --> 26:35.830
I won't ef tell anyone to just
like throw it.

26:35.830 --> 26:38.990
>> I'll try and kill it.

26:38.990 --> 26:42.990
Who would you like to see
walk out of this house?

26:42.990 --> 26:46.990
>> It's hard because it's like
so early in the game.

26:46.990 --> 26:49.990
>> This is not definite in the
plan, so, like, don't start

26:49.990 --> 26:50.990
freaking out.

26:50.990 --> 26:51.990
>> No, which know.

26:51.990 --> 26:54.990
But we were talking about
maybe you could be possibly put

26:54.990 --> 26:55.990
up on a pawn.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.700
>> Everyone loves you.

26:58.700 --> 26:58.990
No.

26:58.990 --> 27:00.990
How do you know that, though?

27:00.990 --> 27:01.990
>> Colon.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.990
Whoever is next you to is going
home.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.990
>> Listen you're going to have
to roll with us because, like,

27:06.990 --> 27:09.410
out there it's dangerous.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.990
>> I got people in mind right
now.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.990
And I can say that you're not
one of them.

27:12.990 --> 27:16.990
All we're saying is, like, if we
keep you off the block, do we

27:16.990 --> 27:17.990
have your vote?

27:17.990 --> 27:19.990
You know what I'm saying?

27:19.990 --> 27:20.990
>> Absolutely.

27:20.990 --> 27:21.990
James, eyes up here.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.990
The idea is to get people to be
pawns.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.410
Just because you're pretty don't
mean we can actually keep her

27:26.410 --> 27:28.990
safe for this week.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.950
>> Thank you, fellas.

27:31.950 --> 27:32.990
Yeah.

27:32.990 --> 27:40.990
What would you say if you had
to go up as a pawn?

27:40.990 --> 27:43.990
>> I would be very strongly
against that because I'm afraid

27:43.990 --> 27:45.990
I'm the target.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.990
>> All the girls in here love
you.

27:47.990 --> 27:48.990
We have your back.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.990
We're the hohs.

27:50.990 --> 27:52.990
We're the post powerful players
in the game.

27:52.990 --> 27:58.990
>> Yes, you are.

27:58.990 --> 28:05.990
We're giving you two, three
chances to save yourself.

28:05.990 --> 28:07.990
>> If you needed this and you
came to me because you need me

28:07.990 --> 28:12.990
as a pawn, how you would react
if I was like, I don't know,

28:12.990 --> 28:13.410
man.

28:13.410 --> 28:13.990
I can't do that?

28:13.990 --> 28:14.990
You know?

28:14.990 --> 28:20.990
>> Well, it wouldn't have had
anything to do with me.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.990
>> Throughout "big brother"
history, there's so many people

28:22.990 --> 28:25.990
who have gone home because they
thought they were pawns and

28:25.990 --> 28:26.990
promised they were safe.

28:26.990 --> 28:28.540
That promise has been broken so
many times.

28:28.540 --> 28:34.990
Why would anyone agree to this?

28:34.990 --> 28:37.000
>> People like you.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.990
I think you would be a good pawn
because you are so grateful no

28:42.990 --> 28:44.990
one wants to take the experience
from you.

28:44.990 --> 28:45.990
The pawn.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.990
>> The pawns go home and you
know that.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.990
>> I feel like this is a huge
way to undoubtedly earn trust in

28:51.990 --> 28:54.990
this house.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.540
Our responsibility as head of
household is to each nominate

29:19.540 --> 29:27.990
two people for eviction.

29:27.990 --> 29:30.990
>> You will each choose a box,
open it, and reveal whether

29:30.990 --> 29:34.990
you'll be selecting your
nominees first or second.

29:34.990 --> 29:44.990
Good luck.

29:44.990 --> 29:49.990
Good luck.

29:49.990 --> 29:52.990
>> These nominations are
definitely part of a master plan

29:52.990 --> 29:53.990
for a back door this week.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.540
I would say the two people I'm
nominating would definitely be

29:56.540 --> 30:03.990
seen as pawns.

30:03.990 --> 30:06.990
>> So I see these two nominees,
that leave me with the nominees

30:06.990 --> 30:07.990
that are left in the case.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.990
But now I got to make my
decision.

30:10.990 --> 30:12.990
I'm from the country.

30:12.990 --> 30:13.990
I ain't scared.

30:13.990 --> 30:16.990
The only thing I got to do is
make sure my troops are behind

30:16.990 --> 30:26.990
me, and I'm going to be okay.

30:35.950 --> 30:37.990
>> This is the nomination
ceremony.

30:37.990 --> 30:44.990
It is our responsibility as the
heads of households to nominate

30:44.990 --> 30:47.990
two houseguests for eviction.

30:47.990 --> 31:01.410
The first houseguest I have
nominated is --

31:01.410 --> 31:13.990
zoo the next houseguest I have
nominated is --

31:13.990 --> 31:17.990
I have nominated you, Johnny,
and you Becky.

31:17.990 --> 31:22.410
My personal connection has not
been that strong with you, but I

31:22.410 --> 31:25.950
see you both as strong
competitors and I would like to

31:25.950 --> 31:31.990
give you a chance to compete and
save yourselves this week.

31:31.990 --> 31:46.990
>> The first houseguest I have
nominated is --

31:46.990 --> 32:01.990
the second houseguest I have
nominated is --

32:01.990 --> 32:03.990
I've nominated you, Steve, and
you, Jackie.

32:03.990 --> 32:07.990
I'm pretty sure y'all both will
get yourself off the block.

32:07.990 --> 32:11.990
So that's why I nominated both
you guys.

32:11.990 --> 32:21.990
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

32:21.990 --> 32:24.990
>> Definitely weird to be on the
block, especially for the first

32:24.990 --> 32:25.700
week.

32:25.700 --> 32:26.990
James is guaranteeing my safety.

32:26.990 --> 32:32.990
I just hope this doesn't come
back to bite me in the ass.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.990
>> Everybody has a fear they're
going up on the block, but I

32:34.990 --> 32:36.950
truly wasn't really worried.

32:36.950 --> 32:38.700
My social game's pretty strong.

32:38.700 --> 32:41.990
At this point, I've made some
good relationships that I think

32:41.990 --> 32:46.700
have brought me pretty dang far
in this game.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.990
>> I'm superhappy that the plan
was executed and everything was

32:49.990 --> 32:52.990
the way that I wanted it.

32:52.990 --> 32:56.990
I'm acting surprised on the
outside.

32:56.990 --> 32:58.990
But on the inside I'm
celebrating like a 15-year-old

32:58.990 --> 33:01.990
girl at her birthday party.
♪

33:10.990 --> 33:15.990
>> I just feel we
haven't talked

33:15.990 --> 33:15.990
a lot.

33:15.990 --> 33:16.990
That's all.

33:16.990 --> 33:17.990
>> Yeah.

33:17.990 --> 33:20.990
I'm happy this is like a
chance for us to --

33:20.990 --> 33:22.990
>> yeah.

33:22.990 --> 33:25.700
Do you have any idea what's
up?

33:25.700 --> 33:28.990
>> I mean, I feel like they're
trying to backdoor someone.

33:28.990 --> 33:33.990
>> Is there any particular
strategy or anything like that?

33:33.990 --> 33:39.990
>> Kill it.

33:39.990 --> 33:42.830
You can be confident without
being cocky.

33:42.830 --> 33:43.990
>> Uh-hmm.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.990
When get cocky, you get
lazy --

33:45.990 --> 33:46.990
>> right.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.290
We can't expect anything.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.990
Okay.

33:50.990 --> 33:53.990
I mean, I'm just saying we're
going to win, put that

33:53.990 --> 33:59.830
positivity out there.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.990
>> Feeling good?

34:00.990 --> 34:00.990
Yep.

34:00.990 --> 34:01.950
Cool.

34:01.950 --> 34:02.990
Okay.

34:02.990 --> 34:03.950
All right.

34:03.950 --> 34:03.990
Okay.

34:03.990 --> 34:09.990
I believe in you.

34:15.990 --> 34:18.990
Was going in with maybe too
much confidence into the

34:18.990 --> 34:20.410
ceremony.

34:20.410 --> 34:22.410
It seemed like I was safe, so
I'm really surprised and a

34:22.410 --> 34:32.540
little hurt too.

34:32.540 --> 34:37.990
Little hurt too.

34:37.990 --> 34:39.990
>> I'm just a little blindsided.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.540
Knew were you going to --
imam sorry.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.990
This is to throw people off out
there.

34:45.990 --> 34:48.120
I did not want to make no girls
cry.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.990
I do not like to see that.

34:49.990 --> 34:52.290
But I'm just trying to protect
myself at this point.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.990
I am just trying to do damage
control with Becky.

34:55.990 --> 34:56.990
Don't be worried.

34:56.990 --> 34:59.290
>> I trust.

34:59.290 --> 35:00.990
You I'm telling him what he
wants to hear.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.990
I trust your plan.

35:02.990 --> 35:06.990
Reality, I'm thinking, you
idiot.

35:06.990 --> 35:08.830
We're going to win the battle of
the block and I would definitely

35:08.830 --> 35:10.990
put Jason on the block next
week.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.990
>> Hey, everybody, it's time for
the first battle of the block

35:19.990 --> 35:21.000
competition of the summer!

35:21.000 --> 35:21.990
>> Oh, my God.

35:21.990 --> 35:23.990
Yeah!

35:23.990 --> 35:25.990
It's time to get to work.

35:25.990 --> 35:26.990
Yeah!

35:26.990 --> 35:35.990
(Cheers)
>> Yeah.

35:35.990 --> 35:38.990
All right.

35:38.990 --> 35:39.990
Take a look.

35:39.990 --> 35:44.990
So walking out for the Bob
competition and it feels like

35:44.990 --> 35:48.990
I'm a thousand feet above the
clouds in a city that looks like

35:48.990 --> 35:50.950
Dubai.

35:50.950 --> 35:52.000
I've been around the world and I
haven't seen anything like this.

35:52.000 --> 35:52.990
It's insane.

35:52.990 --> 35:55.990
>> All right.

35:55.990 --> 35:59.540
Welcome to du-Bob, the
fastest growing city in the

35:59.540 --> 36:03.410
world in this battle of the
block competition, James'

36:03.410 --> 36:06.990
nominees will battle Jason's
nominees to save themselves from

36:06.990 --> 36:07.990
the choking blok.

36:07.990 --> 36:11.410
The winning pair are not only
safe for the week but will

36:11.410 --> 36:16.990
dethrone the hoh that nominated
them sending them back into the

36:16.990 --> 36:17.990
pool of regular houseguests.

36:17.990 --> 36:21.990
James, jace, than means one of
the you can go from being hoh to

36:21.990 --> 36:23.990
being evicted this week.

36:23.990 --> 36:24.990
Nominees, here's how it works.

36:24.990 --> 36:28.120
Team also add to the skyline by
building a new skyscraper.

36:28.120 --> 36:34.990
When the horn sounds, uncover
the blueprint showing yo how you

36:34.990 --> 36:37.990
how to construct a tower.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.990
Across the beams to the build
platforms.

36:40.990 --> 36:41.990
But be careful.

36:41.990 --> 36:44.990
If you drop a piece or fall off
the beam, you must go back to

36:44.990 --> 36:47.990
your last platform before
continuing on.

36:47.990 --> 36:50.990
The first team to correctly
build their tower and get both

36:50.990 --> 36:55.950
players back to the supply
platform, then hit their button

36:55.950 --> 36:55.990
wins.

36:55.990 --> 36:58.830
Who's ready to play du-Bob?

36:58.830 --> 37:06.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Jason's been telling me I'm a

37:06.990 --> 37:08.000
pawn.

37:08.000 --> 37:17.990
But I need to win this battle of
the block to ensure my safety.

37:17.990 --> 37:21.410
>> This dentist is ready to kick
some teeth in.

37:21.410 --> 37:24.990
[ Horn ]
>> Yeah!

37:24.990 --> 37:29.990
(Screams)
>> The object of the battle of

37:29.990 --> 37:34.120
the block is to transfer 26
building blocks across a high

37:34.120 --> 37:35.990
beam that's rotating.

37:35.990 --> 37:36.990
>> Oh, my God.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.290
That is so hard.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.990
>> Have wrecking balls coming
through.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.700
And once we get to the end with
our blocks, we have to construct

37:43.700 --> 37:45.830
the building.

37:45.830 --> 37:45.990
>> Becky.

37:45.990 --> 37:46.410
(Applause).

37:46.410 --> 37:47.990
>> Good job.

37:47.990 --> 37:50.990
We have to figure out a way
that John and I can both be on

37:50.990 --> 37:53.830
the team at the same time
without -- beam at the same time

37:53.830 --> 37:56.990
without knocking one another off
but quickly getting our blocks

37:56.990 --> 37:59.990
to the other side.

37:59.990 --> 38:02.540
>> Our strategy is to both go at
the same time, put our pieces

38:02.540 --> 38:06.950
and then we can both come back
and do it again.

38:06.950 --> 38:07.990
>> No, no.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.120
As a dancer, I have really
great balance, so I know I'm

38:10.120 --> 38:12.410
going to do really well on this
challenge.

38:12.410 --> 38:13.990
[ Buzzer ]
>> Yeah, you got it.

38:13.990 --> 38:14.290
You got it.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.990
You got it.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.990
[ Buzzer ]
>> In this competition, if you

38:18.990 --> 38:21.990
fall off the beam, you have to
return to the beginning.

38:21.990 --> 38:24.990
John and I do not have the time
to make these mistakes.

38:24.990 --> 38:27.990
It could put us behind.

38:27.990 --> 38:28.990
>> Oh!

38:28.990 --> 38:29.120
Oh.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.990
H.

38:30.990 --> 38:33.120
These people are falling off
left and right.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.290
(Screams)
[ Buzzer ]

38:35.290 --> 38:40.990
[ Buzzer ]
>> And I would hate to see the

38:40.990 --> 38:44.830
workers -- it's going to be
astronomical.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.120
>> A wrecking ball there, I'm
hoping someone gets hit in the

38:47.120 --> 38:50.990
mouth because it could be more
business for me down the road.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.990
I just don't want it to be me.

38:53.990 --> 38:57.000
>> It's like a video game.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.990
Oh!

39:02.990 --> 39:09.990
Mario!

39:11.990 --> 39:12.990
Hang on.

39:12.990 --> 39:13.990
[ Buzzer ]
>> He's having a really hard

39:13.990 --> 39:18.410
time on this balance beam and
unfortunately, you're only as

39:18.410 --> 39:20.290
strong as your weakest link.

39:20.290 --> 39:22.990
[ Buzzer ]
>> I keep falling and I can't

39:22.990 --> 39:24.700
find my balance.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.120
My strategy to fix that is to
lower my center of mass and

39:27.120 --> 39:29.990
start crawling instead of
walking so it makes it harder

39:29.990 --> 39:31.410
for me to fall off the beam.

39:31.410 --> 39:31.990
>> Yeah.

39:31.990 --> 39:37.990
(Applause)
>> It looks like it's working.

39:37.990 --> 39:42.990
I could be up the creek without
a paddle right now.

39:42.990 --> 39:46.990
>> Watching Steve crawl across
the beam with his block in front

39:46.990 --> 39:50.990
of him is like a little mouse
chasing his cheese across the

39:50.990 --> 40:00.990
finish line.

40:00.990 --> 40:03.990
>> We got to the a part where
there were three cubes laying on

40:03.990 --> 40:05.990
one level state across the
tower.

40:05.990 --> 40:09.990
It's pretty tough to balance
these three cubes and get the

40:09.990 --> 40:13.990
rectangle on top of it because
that rectangle block is a pretty

40:13.990 --> 40:15.990
big awkward piece.

40:15.990 --> 40:18.990
>> So as I'm running across the
beams of course it looked like

40:18.990 --> 40:20.830
we're neck and neck.

40:20.830 --> 40:23.540
I really want to win this battle
of the block because it's the

40:23.540 --> 40:25.700
only way to guarantee my safety.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.290
>> Oh.

40:26.290 --> 40:26.990
It's okay.

40:26.990 --> 40:27.990
It's okay.

40:27.990 --> 40:28.120
>> Take your time.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.990
No more falling.

40:29.990 --> 40:30.990
We can push this.

40:30.990 --> 40:32.830
>> It is so close right now.

40:32.830 --> 40:33.990
And I just want to get this
done.

40:33.990 --> 40:34.990
I want to win this.

40:34.990 --> 40:42.990
I want to get me and Steve off
the block this week.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.290
>> You're being a beast right
now!

40:45.290 --> 40:49.990
>> I'm definitely rooting for
Jackie, but I can't show this

40:49.990 --> 40:52.830
excitement because I don't want
to increase the target that I

40:52.830 --> 40:55.990
already have on my back about
Jackie and I potentially being

40:55.990 --> 40:59.990
partners.

40:59.990 --> 41:03.000
>> Come on, Jackie!

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm rooting for Becky and
Johnny right now.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.990
If they pull this off, I stay
hoh and Jason's out of here.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.990
>> I hate being on the block
right now.

41:12.990 --> 41:14.990
I really don't feel like I
should be here.

41:14.990 --> 41:18.540
But if I can win it, then I
guarantee my safety for the

41:18.540 --> 41:29.990
week, and that's all that
matters right now.

41:29.990 --> 41:32.990
>> Yeah.

41:32.990 --> 41:33.990
All right.

41:33.990 --> 41:37.990
(Cheers)
>> You smell that?

41:37.990 --> 41:38.990
Smells like victory.

41:38.990 --> 41:43.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Congratulations, John and

41:43.990 --> 41:44.990
Becky.

41:44.990 --> 41:46.700
You guys have won the battle of
the block competition.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.990
(Applause)
>> Woo!

41:48.990 --> 41:50.990
Yeah!

41:50.990 --> 41:51.990
Woo!

41:51.990 --> 41:54.990
I am off the block, and I
couldn't be hatchier.

41:54.990 --> 41:55.990
-- Happier.

41:55.990 --> 41:58.990
But at the same time I've shown
to the house that I'm here to

41:58.990 --> 42:05.990
compete and I did want to be on
the block this early in the

42:05.990 --> 42:06.990
game.

42:06.990 --> 42:08.990
We'll see how next week goes.

42:08.990 --> 42:10.950
>> I got all the power in my
house.

42:10.950 --> 42:11.990
I got my troops behind me.

42:11.990 --> 42:14.990
I'm walking in on a 12-point
buck looking really good right

42:14.990 --> 42:15.990
now.

42:15.990 --> 42:18.990
>> I'm sorry, jace, that means
you have been -- Jason, that

42:18.990 --> 42:23.990
means you have been dethroned as
head of household.

42:23.990 --> 42:24.990
>> Oh!

42:24.990 --> 42:26.990
So I am dethroned.

42:26.990 --> 42:30.700
I I'm back downstairs with the
peasants but I really am hoping

42:30.700 --> 42:34.990
that James ends up staying with
our plan and backdooring jace.

42:34.990 --> 42:38.990
>> Oh!

42:38.990 --> 42:41.990
F all the things I wanted do
in the big brother house, fight

42:41.990 --> 42:46.990
for my life in the first basket
06b. Was not one of them.

42:46.990 --> 42:49.990
I do want to make sure I do
everything in my power so I win

42:49.990 --> 42:51.990
this veto so I can save myself.

42:51.990 --> 42:53.990
>> Announcer: Who will win the
power of veto?

42:53.990 --> 42:56.290
And it will be used to save
either Jackie or Steve from

42:56.290 --> 42:57.990
eviction?
