got Picassos.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.980
- No.
- We got cartoons down here.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.560
They don't give a damn about our division.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.520

that new slogan,

07:56.720 --> 07:58.730
the one for the whole company
that they're talking about.

07:58.930 --> 08:00.230

- What?

08:00.430 --> 08:01.900
- You know where it came from?
- No.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.650
That damn slogan came from
a convict about to get executed

08:04.840 --> 08:06.350
in front of a firing squad,
and they asked him,

08:06.550 --> 08:08.270
"What's your last words?"

08:08.470 --> 08:09.980
"Just do it"?

08:10.180 --> 08:11.980
- Yeah.
- That's where that comes from?

08:12.180 --> 08:13.520
Yeah.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.440
- Bullshit.
- Dan Wieden told me, man.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.770
He ain't got no reason to lie to me.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.850
Ah, kind of a fitting metaphor

08:19.050 --> 08:21.190
for the way basketball
is viewed at this company.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.730
I know. "Nike.
Just get the shit over with."

08:23.930 --> 08:25.230
- (laughs)
- Ow.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.520
What'd it say about me that I liked it?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.020
That says that you
a fat middle-aged white guy

08:30.220 --> 08:31.400

08:38.930 --> 08:40.980

08:41.180 --> 08:43.850

08:44.050 --> 08:46.900
who we really are
when we are down for the count.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.900
Am I right, huh?

08:49.090 --> 08:52.440
When you're down on the canvas,
bang, we pop right back up.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.730
Like Balboa.

08:54.930 --> 08:56.230
We got the eye of the tiger.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.230
We're not gonna go down to Mr. T.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.940

Lots to choose from.

09:37.340 --> 09:41.060
Don't rush into any thoughts.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.270
Come on, fellas.

09:42.470 --> 09:46.190
What about Lancaster Gordon? Anybody?

09:46.390 --> 09:47.440
Louisville.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.980
Louisville. He went to Louisville, Bill.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.900
That is correct. I wrote it right there.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.310
How about-- What do we think
about Charles Barkley,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.400
the Round Mound of Rebound?

09:54.590 --> 09:56.230
Could be a little bit of a reach for us

09:56.430 --> 09:57.950
- at pick five.
- Clubhouse issues.

09:59.370 --> 10:01.650
Clubhouse issues? What does that mean?

10:01.840 --> 10:02.900
Trash talk.

10:03.090 --> 10:05.400
Nobody wants to see Barkley on TV.

10:05.590 --> 10:08.190
STRASSER: Does anybody hear me
if I'm down in the valley

10:08.390 --> 10:10.810
singing the song of a man they call

10:11.010 --> 10:12.940
Terence "T Bone" Stansbury?

10:13.140 --> 10:14.650
I don't think they call him that.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.770
Well, we could if he wears Nikes.

10:17.970 --> 10:18.900
Think about it.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.520
What about this fella, Vern Fleming?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.480
Tough name, good J.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.980
I like Melvin Turpin.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.900
Melvin Turpin.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.480
Thank you, Bill. On the board.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.270
TIM:
What about John Stockton?

10:29.470 --> 10:31.900
Uh, he's scrappy just like us.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.560
Gonzaga? Sure.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.940
What's that, a vocational school?

10:35.140 --> 10:36.940
SONNY:
What do you like about Melvin Turpin?

10:37.140 --> 10:38.980
Hmm?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.190
Mel Turpin.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.650
What do you like about his game?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.060
Go, Bill.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.310
He made the Final Four last year.

10:46.510 --> 10:48.290
Well, so did 40 other guys.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.730
He's the fifth-- uh,
s-sixth pick in the draft.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.850
SONNY:
Have you watched him play?

10:54.050 --> 10:55.440
Yeah, several times.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.940
What-what do you like about his game?

10:57.140 --> 10:59.520
He's got great court sense. He's, uh...

10:59.720 --> 11:02.150
- He's got good vision.
- He had 33 assists last season.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.560
BILL:
I like his play.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.060
- I like that the guy's got...
- Okay, all right, no, no.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.560
It's all right, no.
He's gonna be a good player.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.150
He's got charisma. He's got flash.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.900
He's gonna be a good player
in Europe in four years

11:10.090 --> 11:11.150
when he's out of the league.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.400
- Okay.
- No, you like Mel Turpin

11:12.590 --> 11:13.560
'cause he's the sixth pick in the draft.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.440
Nobody's gonna give you shit for saying
you like the sixth pick in the draft.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.770
Yeah, I'm just-- I'm some
fucking asshole, Sonny.

11:17.970 --> 11:18.940
You're not an asshole.

11:19.140 --> 11:19.940
SONNY:
No, he's got great vision, Bill.

11:20.140 --> 11:20.940
Sonny's trying for it, though.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.250
Here we go. Anybody else?

11:26.950 --> 11:28.350
I got to shit.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.440
- (door closes)
- SONNY: Hey, Rob.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.310
STRASSER: Hey, Sonny, wh--
honestly, what the fuck is your problem?

11:33.510 --> 11:35.060
- Who are we gonna get?
- (urinating)

11:35.260 --> 11:37.060
You tell me. Phil brought you here

11:37.260 --> 11:39.020
because you're the Mr. Miyagi
of high school basketball.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.480
You're not supposed to lecture people.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.770
You're supposed to tell us
who's gonna paint the fence.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.730
- I like Barkley some.
- (scoffs)

11:44.930 --> 11:46.150
- I mean, "clubhouse issues."
- Barkley?

11:46.340 --> 11:47.850
That is the fucking dumbest thing
I have ever

11:48.050 --> 11:49.520
heard in that room,
and that is saying something.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.060
I mentioned Barkley in there.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.270
You didn't think it was relevant

11:52.470 --> 11:53.810
to chime in to support
my idea about Barkley...

11:54.010 --> 11:55.690
But what happens in there is bullshit.
I'm telling you now.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.770
- ...spend two hours just sitting there?
- I'm not gonna say it in the meeting.

11:57.970 --> 11:58.850
STRASSER:
Well, listen, people are

11:59.050 --> 12:00.730
- afraid to speak in there.
- Why?

12:00.930 --> 12:02.270
Because you spend a half hour
berating them

12:02.470 --> 12:04.270
- no matter what they say.
- No, no.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.520
- STRASSER: Yes, you do.
- I just have no tolerance for

12:06.720 --> 12:08.980
people who have no insight,
fucking do no work,

12:09.180 --> 12:11.190
and then act like
they got a seat at the table.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.020
- Okay.
- Mel Turpin.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.270
We'd be better off signing my mom.

12:15.470 --> 12:16.770
Not available.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.250
Well, even if she were alive,
we can't afford her.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.400
Could afford my mom.

12:22.590 --> 12:23.560
Clubhouse issues.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.310
Listen, we got 250K for three names.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.900
This is where you come up with
a brilliant idea that no one else can see.

12:29.090 --> 12:31.020
- Let's hear it.
- We need more money.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.560
That's not brilliant, okay?

12:32.760 --> 12:33.850
That's what happens
when things are successful.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.020
What's happening right now is failure,

12:36.220 --> 12:38.190
and if it continues that way,
Nike's gonna be out of

12:38.390 --> 12:39.980
the basketball business
and we're gonna be out of a job.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.480
We just-- We need good players.
We need good players.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.020
Great. Good players.
Barkley, Stockton, Thorpe.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.400
I really like Stockton.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.060
Do you even know where Gonzaga is?

12:48.260 --> 12:50.060
I didn't say it's ideal, okay?
It's a name,

12:50.260 --> 12:51.560
which is better than
what you've given me, okay?

12:51.760 --> 12:53.370
- Rob. Rob.
- Yeah? What?

12:54.750 --> 12:56.150
What about Jordan?

12:56.340 --> 12:58.690
(scoffs) Sonny, we can't get
fucking Michael Jordan.

12:58.890 --> 13:01.310
Okay? I listened to Falk for three hours.

13:01.510 --> 13:02.400
He's too expensive.

13:02.590 --> 13:03.520
- Sorry.
- Mr. Strasser.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.350
Huh? Hello. Hi.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.150
- Richard.
- Yeah. Hi. Hi, Richard.

13:07.340 --> 13:08.810
I'd love to get some time
on your calendar.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.980
Okay. That sounds fun.
Can you let Doreen know?

13:11.180 --> 13:12.350
Roger that. Will do.

13:12.550 --> 13:13.980
- Roger, thank you.
- Richard.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.810
Yeah, yeah. Just rogering you back there.

13:16.010 --> 13:16.900
- Yeah.
- That's what that was, okay?

13:17.090 --> 13:18.350
- Thanks, Richard.
- Thank you.

13:18.550 --> 13:19.770
Bye.

13:19.970 --> 13:20.900
(sighs):
Oh, God.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.810
You know, there-- Thank you.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.730
There, uh, there used to be a time

13:24.930 --> 13:26.810
where I could name
everybody who worked here.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.900
Ah, things change.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.770
Places grow.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.100
That's true.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.770
Hey, you want some dessert?

13:33.970 --> 13:35.440
It's sundae bar day.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.810
Hi.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.400
Uh, I have a meeting.

13:38.590 --> 13:39.980
With who?

13:40.180 --> 13:42.060
The shoe dog.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.810

13:44.010 --> 13:47.950

14:14.050 --> 14:15.100

KNIGHT:
Sonny.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.440
I'm missing the sundae bar, Phil.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.810
(door closes)

14:20.010 --> 14:22.480
Why do you think this guy is
skateboarding to work?

14:22.680 --> 14:24.940
We're a public company.
Does he not have a car?

14:25.140 --> 14:26.350
SONNY:
Probably just some kid.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.520
He looks like he's 50 years old.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.580
He's bald and he has a beard.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.150
SONNY:
Is that Pete?

14:32.340 --> 14:33.770
KNIGHT:
Why would Pete skateboard to work?

14:33.970 --> 14:36.690
Maybe he's having a midlife crisis.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.310
Oh. I hope he doesn't scratch my car.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.600
- (sighs)
- It takes 17 layers of paint

14:41.800 --> 14:44.100
to achieve that precise color of purple.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.940
They call it "grape,"
which sounds kind of pedestrian,

14:46.140 --> 14:48.190
but it's pretty.

14:48.390 --> 14:50.600
Anyway, how was the strategy meeting?

14:50.800 --> 14:51.870
Disaster.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.450
Uh, wonderful. What's the plan?

14:56.540 --> 14:59.150
Piss away our tiny allocation
on three mediocre players again.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.150
Sonny, we had an annual loss.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.230
I had to lay off a quarter
of the fucking company, okay?

15:03.430 --> 15:06.100
- I know, Phil.
- Do you? Do you know

15:06.300 --> 15:07.900
the whole basketball division's
on the chopping block?

15:08.090 --> 15:09.310
That the board wants me to fire everybody?

15:09.510 --> 15:10.980
And I can't guarantee you,
without some improvement,

15:11.180 --> 15:13.440
that's not gonna happen
at the next board meeting.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.190
W-We need to increase spending.

15:15.390 --> 15:16.650
(scoffs)

15:16.840 --> 15:20.310
I brought you in here to grow
the basketball business.

15:20.510 --> 15:22.020
It's-it's smaller now.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.350
Is Strasser's number right?

15:23.550 --> 15:24.810
- 250K?
- Yeah.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.480
- All right, what about 500?
- No.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.350
You're lucky to have 250K.
I had to fight for that.

15:29.550 --> 15:30.810
Your balance sheet's a debacle.

15:31.010 --> 15:33.980
Half the running shoes in the country
that were sold last year were Nikes.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.270
It's 900 million in revenue.

15:35.470 --> 15:38.230
You want to spend 250K on basketball?

15:38.430 --> 15:40.310
You know what they're telling the board?

15:40.510 --> 15:43.850
There are potentially a million customers
for basketball shoes in the United States,

15:44.050 --> 15:46.850
who would wear those shoes
only when they're playing basketball.

15:47.050 --> 15:49.650
They're wondering if any investment
is worth the potential upside.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.600
Well, if a board member said it.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.290
The board...

15:54.290 --> 15:56.060
Basketball is the future.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.900
The NBA finals are on tape delay.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.230
It's literally the past.

15:59.430 --> 16:01.560
People watch basketball.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.730
You know, we took four golds
at the Olympics.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.520
And nobody gives a fuck.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.150
We dominate
the running shoe market, Sonny.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.310
200 million running shoes,
'cause that's what people do.

16:10.510 --> 16:11.480
They run.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.150
And when they walk,
they wear running shoes.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.730
And when they go to the store,
they wear running shoes,

16:14.930 --> 16:16.480
and when they go to work,
they wear running shoes.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.250
That's what they do.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.560
People are starting to ask me
what you do here.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.480
You know what I do here.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.400
I-I know you, I know you go

16:25.590 --> 16:27.310
to a lot of high school
basketball tournaments.

16:27.510 --> 16:30.230
And, uh, usually with a layover in Vegas.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.060
And I-I'm told that

16:32.260 --> 16:36.100
you're a basketball guru or wizard or...
(stammers)

16:36.300 --> 16:37.980
It's hard to quantify that to a board.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.480
You know what I do here.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.480
You're losing, Sonny.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.190
You know, just because you lose,
it doesn't mean it wasn't a good bet.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.400
This perfect results bullshit...

16:45.590 --> 16:47.310
- It's not bullshit.
- It is bullshit.

16:47.510 --> 16:49.150
It's not bullshit.
Those are the central principles

16:49.340 --> 16:51.150
that built this into
a billion-dollar business.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.980
I can't win if you don't
give me a bankroll.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.520
You have to be accountable.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.850
You're accountable. We're all accountable.

16:56.050 --> 16:57.020
I'm accountable to the board.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.310
I told you not to go public.

16:58.510 --> 16:59.480
I told you this would happen.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.770
- You'd get tight, you'd change.
- I see.

17:00.970 --> 17:02.400
- This happens at every company.
- Uh, does it?

17:02.590 --> 17:03.810
- All the companies you've taken public?
- Yeah, every company,

17:04.010 --> 17:05.350
all they care about
is the P and L statement

17:05.550 --> 17:06.650
and-and keeping the board happy.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.730
Do you run?

17:08.930 --> 17:10.810
(sighs)

17:11.010 --> 17:13.650
Is this gonna lead to some
Buddhist aphorism I don't want to hear?

17:13.840 --> 17:14.810
Do you run?

17:15.010 --> 17:16.730
(sighs)

17:16.930 --> 17:19.290
- No, Phil, I don't.
- It's hard.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.980
It's suffering. It's difficult.

17:22.180 --> 17:25.150

23:29.930 --> 23:30.980
from Wilmington, North Carolina?

23:31.180 --> 23:33.810
Eh, they probably drew up
the play for Worthy,

23:34.010 --> 23:35.980
and Jordan was an option
in case Worthy was covered.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.270
No, that's wrong.

They're in a 1-3-1 zone.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.350
What's gonna happen the second
Worthy comes across the lane?

23:46.550 --> 23:49.440
That zone's gonna collapse on him,
leaving Michael Jordan open in the corner,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.020
and the ball's gonna go to him,
and he's gonna shoot it.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.020
Look, when he shoots it,
he shoots it right away.

23:54.220 --> 23:55.900

24:14.370 --> 24:16.900
Look at how relaxed he is.

24:17.090 --> 24:19.690
Look, he wants the ball.
He's calling for the ball.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.940
The whole world is watching him.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.730
He's 18 years old.

24:23.930 --> 24:28.150
He's three seconds away
from the biggest shot of his life.

24:28.340 --> 24:31.980
And the biggest shot of Dean Smith's life.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.100
Remember the knock on Dean Smith?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.480
He couldn't win the big one.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.440
He'd been there three times,
couldn't get it done.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.650
This is his fourth
and maybe his last time.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.400
Dean Smith didn't even start freshmen.

24:40.590 --> 24:43.020
Michael's only the third freshman
to start for the guy.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.560
And what does he do?

24:44.760 --> 24:48.190
He puts the ball in the hands
of an 18-year-old freshman.

24:48.390 --> 24:50.060
Why?

24:50.260 --> 24:53.230
Because Dean sees
the same thing that I see.

24:53.430 --> 24:56.850
The same thing that Lynwood Robinson saw.

24:57.050 --> 24:58.120
Greatness.

25:05.540 --> 25:09.190
I don't want to sign three players.

25:09.390 --> 25:11.480
I want to sign one.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.910
I want to sign him.

25:13.950 --> 25:17.400
We build a shoe line around just him.

25:17.590 --> 25:20.560
We tap into something deeper,
into the player's identity.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.940
Into that.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.560
What's that mean?

25:23.760 --> 25:24.900
That he doesn't wear the shoe.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.400
He is the shoe.

25:26.590 --> 25:27.900
The shoe is him.

25:28.090 --> 25:30.480
You want to anthropomorphize the shoe?

25:30.680 --> 25:31.940
Put little legs and arms on it?

We do that but with a shoe.

25:42.050 --> 25:43.850
I'm gonna blow a quick 20
right here, okay?

25:44.050 --> 25:45.600
It's gonna cost too much money.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.270
No, not if we bet it all on one guy.

25:47.470 --> 25:48.350
Too risky. You want the whole budget?

25:48.550 --> 25:50.350
- The whole budget.
- Can't do that.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.150
We're gonna spread it across
three or four players.

25:52.340 --> 25:53.980
- I've said that.
- We have 250K.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.310
We can get him for 250K.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.810
Guess who else has 250K.

25:58.010 --> 25:59.690
Adidas has 250K, too, okay?

25:59.890 --> 26:04.060
So even if we were to offer him $250,000,
Adidas would be able to match it.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.600
Meanwhile, all our other prospects
have signed with other teams.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.350
Plus, Jordan has made it abundantly clear,

26:09.550 --> 26:12.480
painfully clear,
that he doesn't want to come here.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.980
So you would have to have
a pretty compelling pitch.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.020
Do you have that?

26:16.220 --> 26:19.200
Yeah, I can tell him the one thing
the other companies can't compete with.

is fucking terrible.

- What you gonna offer him?
- The whole budget.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.150

26:36.340 --> 26:38.400
Phil is gonna fire you.

26:38.590 --> 26:39.810
Well, I can handle Phil.

26:40.010 --> 26:42.440
The key to Phil is make him afraid.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.020
You gonna get us both damn fired.

26:44.220 --> 26:47.060
Phil got a hundred million dollars

26:55.300 --> 26:56.690
How the hell you gonna get Michael?

26:56.890 --> 26:58.230
Michael is an Adidas guy.

sitting in the briar patch.

Well, I'll deal with that
after I deal with Phil.

27:08.890 --> 27:09.730
Phil ain't gonna do it.

27:09.930 --> 27:11.770
But you like the idea, right?

27:11.970 --> 27:13.250
I'd like to sign Jordan.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.810
When someone says
it's not about the money,

28:21.010 --> 28:22.230
I know for sure it's about the money.

28:22.430 --> 28:23.900
We decided to stretch the envelope.

28:24.090 --> 28:26.980
We want to hear what each company can do
to promote Michael.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.270
Okay, w-well, then we're thinking
along the same lines.

28:29.470 --> 28:30.770
That's why I want to have a meeting.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.310
Sonny, world-class players
don't wear third-rate shoes.

28:33.510 --> 28:34.940
Just get me in the room.

28:35.140 --> 28:38.270
Sonny, as a friend, it's a waste of time.

28:38.470 --> 28:41.100
Off the record: Even though
UNC was a Converse school,

28:41.300 --> 28:43.290
Michael wore Adidas during practice.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.480
Put on Converse
right before the game started.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.940
The second the final buzzer sounded,

28:48.140 --> 28:49.600
- Adidas back on.
- (fingers snap)

28:49.800 --> 28:50.940
- Bullshit.
- Ask Dean.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.350
You said it was off the record.

28:52.550 --> 28:54.060
I didn't say you had to tell him
where you heard it.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.520
Trust me, Converse knows it, too.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.100
I've already seen
Adidas's mock-up presentation.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.190
Three words: state of the art.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.440
That's four.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.940
You're a stalking horse, at best.

29:04.140 --> 29:07.230
And a slow, fat stalking horse,
so you're not even credible.

29:07.430 --> 29:09.350
You know he'll be miserable at Adidas.

29:09.550 --> 29:11.980
I mean, it's a shit show over there
since Adolf died.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.900
Adi, Sonny. He went by Adi.

29:14.090 --> 29:15.480
His name was Adolf.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.980
I mean, the guy's name
was literally Adolf.

29:17.180 --> 29:18.690
- He was a good man.
- He kept the name.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.690
It's Adi. Adi Dassler.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.230
Adi-Das. Adidas.

29:22.430 --> 29:23.730
- That's what it stands for.
- He was in the Hitler Youth.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.400
No, he wasn't. Don't say that.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.850
I saw a picture of him
personally wearing a swastika.

29:28.050 --> 29:28.900
The guy had the haircut.

29:29.090 --> 29:31.100
- We all have a past.
- Look, David,

29:31.300 --> 29:33.350
some of us have our past
and some of us were Nazis.

29:33.550 --> 29:34.350
There's a line.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.850
Well, he's dead.

29:36.050 --> 29:37.350
We're meeting with the whole family.

29:37.550 --> 29:38.770
When's the meeting?

29:38.970 --> 29:41.560
Uh, Jordans go to Boston, uh, on Thursday.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.770
That's Converse.

29:42.970 --> 29:45.150
And then Nuremberg for Adidas on Saturday,
and then we're gonna close.

29:45.340 --> 29:46.980
- Nuremberg?
- Would you cut the shit?

29:47.180 --> 29:48.900
It's close to-- it's near there.

29:49.090 --> 29:50.660
They want to close is the point.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.870
What are they offering?

29:54.910 --> 29:57.520
I don't see a world
where it's south of 250.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.150
No fucking way.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.730
- SONNY: Let me explain.
- No.

30:00.930 --> 30:03.560
Listen. Michael Jordan is the player
we've been waiting for.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.230
Yeah, but you said the same thing about
Artis Gilmore last year and Bobby Jones.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.690
All right, well, if perfection is
the goal, then I'm doomed, right?

30:09.890 --> 30:11.600
I-I mean, I'm not gonna hit every shot.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.900
How about one shot? A shot, ever.

30:14.090 --> 30:15.310
It's part of gambling, Phil.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.770
- You don't win every hand.
- This isn't a craps table.

30:17.970 --> 30:19.150
And we don't have
unlimited checks to write...

30:19.340 --> 30:20.350
I'm not asking for unlimited.

30:20.550 --> 30:21.940
I'm asking for what you already budgeted.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.400
- On one player.
- Yes.

30:23.590 --> 30:25.600
Don't confuse desperation
with vision, Sonny.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.350
(sighs) We're actually
gonna need more than that.

30:28.550 --> 30:31.690
For a rookie who's never
set foot on an NBA court?

30:31.890 --> 30:34.310
That's the literal definition
of rookie, yeah.

30:34.510 --> 30:36.440
Magic Johnson doesn't have his own shoe.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.120
Exactly.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.600
I can't justify that to the board,
so there's no point

30:41.800 --> 30:42.850
- in having this discussion.
- All right.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.940
Let me put it to you this way.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.690
I'm willing to bet my career
on Michael Jordan.

30:47.890 --> 30:49.690
Oh, come on, man.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.850
You asked me what I do here.
This is what I do.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.230
I find you players.

30:53.430 --> 30:55.020
And I fucking feel it this time.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.060
Yeah, okay, it's risky.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.350
When you were selling sneakers

30:58.550 --> 31:00.060
out of the back of your Plymouth,
that was risky.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.270
It took balls.
I mean, that's why we're all here.

31:02.470 --> 31:03.730
Don't change that now.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.690
Phil, I mean, if you look at him,

31:05.890 --> 31:08.150
if you really look at Jordan like I did,

31:08.340 --> 31:09.900
you're gonna see exactly what I see.

31:10.090 --> 31:11.400
Which is what?

31:11.590 --> 31:14.060
The most competitive guy I have ever seen.

31:14.260 --> 31:15.950
He is a fucking killer.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.020
Who's the competition?

31:19.220 --> 31:22.100

I... I can't imagine the grief.

31:38.390 --> 31:41.310
Ah, as Adi would say,

31:41.510 --> 31:42.850
we must go on.

31:43.050 --> 31:44.600
He did say that.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.520
We have a great opportunity
for Adidas America.

JOE DEAN:
We already got the number one pick.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.410
Who's next on the hit list?

32:02.870 --> 32:03.850
Scoreboard.

32:04.050 --> 32:06.100
What the fuck, guys? We're doing this?

32:06.300 --> 32:08.770
I don't know.
I mean, can-can we even get a meeting?

32:08.970 --> 32:11.100
- Rob?
- Phil, you're signing off on this?

32:11.300 --> 32:12.770
No, it's a stupid fucking idea.

32:12.970 --> 32:14.060
I said, "Can we get a meeting?"

32:14.260 --> 32:15.940
I'll call Falk.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.190
FALK: Submit an offer,
and then we can talk meeting.

32:18.390 --> 32:19.560
SONNY (over phone):
I can't do that.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.560
Then I have no responsibility
to inform my client.

32:21.760 --> 32:22.770
(sighs)

32:22.970 --> 32:25.440
250,000 is what you can expect.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.560
I need it in writing.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.440
When the offer comes, it'll be in writing.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.900
I look forward to seeing it.

32:32.090 --> 32:33.600
I can't wait to waste six hours
flying out there.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.310
Why can't you get a base on the East Coast
like a normal company?

32:37.510 --> 32:39.350
They love it out here.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.900
I'm glad they're happy.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.770
Hey, how are the parents?

32:42.970 --> 32:43.850
Smart as hell.

32:44.050 --> 32:45.940
Don't pull any bullshit on them.
They don't want to be sold to.

32:46.140 --> 32:48.020
Yeah? Are they home now in Carolina?

32:48.220 --> 32:50.690
Don't call them, okay?
I'm not fucking kidding.

32:50.890 --> 32:52.690
That'd be inappropriate
and unprofessional.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.730
S-So is outright refusing a meeting.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.440
That's just business.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.600
Why does Michael want Adidas?

32:58.800 --> 33:01.100
Because he likes their tracksuits.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.850
(stammers) We'll get him
every tracksuit he's ever wanted.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.650
He's a kid.
He's not thinking about what he will have.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.150
He's thinking about
what he doesn't have right now.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.150
You know what else he wants?

33:08.340 --> 33:09.980
- (sighs) What?
- Car.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.940
Red Mercedes 380SL.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.980
But fortunately he's got
an extremely savvy advisor

33:15.180 --> 33:16.520
who thinks long-term.

33:16.720 --> 33:20.160
You know, it's really your humility,
David, that's so impressive.

33:21.540 --> 33:23.150
You know what I think?

33:23.340 --> 33:25.150
You don't have authorization
to make a written offer.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.650
Unless I see an offer in writing,

33:27.840 --> 33:30.040
I have no obligation to inform my client.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.560
- David, don't fucking hang...

33:53.720 --> 33:54.850
I'm not gonna make the meeting
tomorrow morning.

33:55.050 --> 33:56.480
I got to go to L.A.
to see George Raveling.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.900
Who?

33:58.090 --> 33:59.520

34:20.470 --> 34:22.020
I tried.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.850
I tried to put the word in for you guys

34:24.050 --> 34:25.100
during the Olympics. Just...

34:25.300 --> 34:26.600
I know. I appreciate it, man.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.270
Michael's not coming to Nike.

34:28.470 --> 34:31.230
He doesn't even want to meet. You know?

34:31.430 --> 34:33.060
Uh, and believe me,

34:33.260 --> 34:36.400
I-I told him multiple times.

34:36.590 --> 34:38.060
And-and we got along.

34:38.260 --> 34:40.100
He just doesn't like the shoe.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.850
He never even worn the shoes.

34:42.050 --> 34:47.600
He did say if somebody was to buy him
a red Mercedes 380SL,

34:47.800 --> 34:51.440
he would sign a shoe contract
for life with anybody.

34:51.640 --> 34:52.900
Except Nike.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.450
- (chuckles)
- (laughing)

34:57.290 --> 34:58.770
There's nothing cool about Nike.

34:58.970 --> 35:00.690
Even what it means, "Adidas":

35:00.890 --> 35:02.560
"All day I dream about sex."

35:02.760 --> 35:04.440
- "Puma": "Please use my ass."
- That's not what it means.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.440
"Nike" has no-no meaning.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.440
How are the parents?

35:08.640 --> 35:11.190
Solid. She runs shit.

35:11.390 --> 35:12.270
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

35:12.470 --> 35:15.230
Well, so maybe I should talk to her.

35:15.430 --> 35:17.150
Hey.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.310
You bypass the agents
and talk directly to the family,

35:19.510 --> 35:20.480
you're gonna lose your job.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.350
I don't know what's wrong with me.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.980
I been doing this 20 years.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.850
I've never had a feeling like this.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.980
You know when you get a feeling.

35:28.180 --> 35:29.440
- You know?
- Yeah.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.560
Know what?

35:30.760 --> 35:32.350
Don't lose that.

35:32.550 --> 35:34.230
Even if I get fired?

35:34.430 --> 35:35.850
Summer 1963.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.100
A friend of my father's
asked me and his son

35:38.300 --> 35:40.690
to come down to a march in town.

35:40.890 --> 35:44.650
Now, mind you,
I have a full scholarship at Villanova.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.770
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

35:46.970 --> 35:49.190
But I got this feeling.

35:49.390 --> 35:51.190
Don't know why.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.190
So I go.

35:53.390 --> 35:54.520
I get down there.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.900
One of the organizers see
two six-four Black kids,

35:57.090 --> 35:59.730
and they're like, "Oh, you guys
want to help with security?"

35:59.930 --> 36:00.810
(both laugh)

36:01.010 --> 36:02.730
So now we're the Fruits of Islam.

36:02.930 --> 36:04.310
They take us down there.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.600
They throw us up onstage,
right on the podium.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.940
There's cameras.

36:09.140 --> 36:10.770
One of the boosters has to be
a Klan member.

36:10.970 --> 36:11.910
(stammers) You know?

36:14.290 --> 36:16.730
But this voice kept telling me
I should stay.

36:16.930 --> 36:20.730
And I'm there five hours,
and I'm just sweating like... (groans)

36:20.930 --> 36:23.770
Then I saw the last speaker's speech.

36:23.970 --> 36:26.900
We walked offstage.

36:27.090 --> 36:28.190
I said to him, I said,

36:28.390 --> 36:32.020
"Hey, that was the best speech
I ever heard."

36:32.220 --> 36:34.060
He said, "Thank you, young man."

36:34.260 --> 36:37.350
He takes the speech, he folds it up,
and he puts it in my pocket.

36:37.550 --> 36:39.560
Later, I'm looking for my favorite line.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.850
It's not in there.

36:41.050 --> 36:44.150
Then I notice the whole

36:47.450 --> 36:49.690
What was the line you were looking for?

36:49.890 --> 36:51.400
"I have a dream."

36:51.590 --> 36:53.310
Come on. Get the fuck out of here.

36:53.510 --> 36:55.270
- The "I Have a Dr--" You have that?
- Yeah.

36:55.470 --> 36:57.560
See, the first half,

36:57.760 --> 36:59.910
he noticed the audience wasn't with him.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.600
And he changed the whole thing,

37:02.800 --> 37:04.400
- made the whole speech up
- (fingers snap)

37:04.590 --> 37:06.900
- right there on the spot.
- Wow.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.900
So, are you saying I should contact
the Jordans and-and...

37:10.090 --> 37:11.770
Fuck no! (laughing)

37:11.970 --> 37:13.480
(laughing):
You just fucking said

37:13.680 --> 37:15.270
- that that's what I should do.
- No, but that's your voice.

37:15.470 --> 37:17.440
Your voice tells you to do stupid shit.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.850
- My voice made me a part of history.
- Yeah.

But I believe the saying
that if you say what you want,

I think it's admirable,
giving your life for your family.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.940

until there's nothing left to give.

- Hmm?

44:20.180 --> 44:22.850
We're sitting here talking
about my parents instead of about you.

44:23.050 --> 44:25.190
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

44:25.390 --> 44:26.750
There's no doubt about that.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.650
Mr. Vaccaro, now, you do understand
that Michael's intention

44:31.840 --> 44:34.440
is to sign with Adidas
with Converse as a second option?

44:34.640 --> 44:35.520
I do.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.350
And with respect,
I think that's a mistake.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.190
Um, I... I'll make a bet with you.

44:41.390 --> 44:44.440
I'll-I'll tell you exactly how
those meetings are gonna go,

44:44.640 --> 44:47.230
and if I'm wrong,
then-then don't take a meeting with Nike.

44:47.430 --> 44:49.150
But if I'm right,

44:49.340 --> 44:53.040
please consider that-that
you and Michael come out.

44:55.910 --> 44:57.560
- This is Converse, by the way.
John O'Neill. -Mm-hmm.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.810

when I see Michael,

45:12.390 --> 45:15.200
there's only a few other players
who gave me that feeling."

45:16.250 --> 45:18.400
(normal voice):
Now, when he's done,

45:18.590 --> 45:20.850
I'd love it if you would
ask him a question.

45:21.050 --> 45:24.190
"How's Michael gonna stand out
from these other players?

45:24.390 --> 45:26.100
How's he gonna be different?"

45:26.300 --> 45:28.690

45:33.180 --> 45:34.230

- Oh, no.

45:34.430 --> 45:35.650
- You can just tell me.
- (normal voice): Okay.

45:35.840 --> 45:36.980
Sorry.

45:37.180 --> 45:38.450
Here's what they'll say.

45:39.500 --> 45:42.230
"We have the best shoes, plain and simple.

"All leather.

45:44.550 --> 45:46.270

45:46.470 --> 45:47.560

45:47.760 --> 45:49.980
I mean, this is me talking now
and not Adidas.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.190
They're not wrong.

45:51.390 --> 45:53.350
I-I get why Michael wants to go there.

45:53.550 --> 45:55.190
Here's what you should ask them.

45:55.390 --> 45:56.850
Mm-hmm?

45:57.050 --> 45:58.690
"Who's running your company?"

45:58.890 --> 46:02.690
I think four different people in that room
are gonna give you four different answers.

46:02.890 --> 46:04.940
And that's the problem
at Adidas right now,

46:05.140 --> 46:08.560
and it's gonna be a real headache for you
for the next few years.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.770
What should I ask you?

46:10.970 --> 46:14.520
Ask me why I'm in
Wilmington, North Carolina.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.540
Why are you in Wilmington, North Carolina?

46:20.450 --> 46:22.580
Because I believe in your son.

46:23.750 --> 46:25.830
I believe he's different.

46:27.200 --> 46:31.080
And I believe you might be
the only person on Earth who knows it.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.790
That's why I'm in
Wilmington, North Carolina.

46:39.620 --> 46:42.940
Well, Mr. Vaccaro, thank you for coming.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.650

from people like you.

47:14.970 --> 47:17.560
When you go around me,
you make me look ineffectual.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.600
And if you end up signing him,
it makes me look irrelevant.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.020
Now, that's the worst thing
you can do to an agent.

47:22.220 --> 47:24.150

is becoming self-evident

I don't see how that's my fault.

you should take up with your therapist.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.190
You don't want to talk to my therapist.

47:31.390 --> 47:35.020
You don't want to have a life
half as fucking miserable as my therapist.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.020
But you're giving me no choice.

48:00.550 --> 48:03.150
You fucking herpes simplex 2 motherfucker!

48:03.340 --> 48:06.150
You know, the fact that you know
there's a second simplex of herpes

48:06.340 --> 48:07.900
makes me think that
you might have it, David.

48:08.090 --> 48:09.900
Of course I do! Everyone has herpes!

48:10.090 --> 48:11.560
You know why you don't, Sonny?

48:11.760 --> 48:13.600
Because no one will fuck you. No one.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.480
I never looked at it that way.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.270
You know what?
I'm a fucking monster, okay?

48:17.470 --> 48:19.100
My lawyers are on six-figure retainers.

48:19.300 --> 48:20.310
I will break you in half.

48:20.510 --> 48:22.310
I will take your balls and nibble on them.

48:22.510 --> 48:24.020
I will chew your fucking nut sack.

48:24.220 --> 48:25.440
Do you hear me?

48:25.640 --> 48:28.350
I will fucking take your nuts
and fucking eat them--

48:28.550 --> 48:30.480
I will eat your fucking nuts!

48:30.680 --> 48:32.310
I will-- You know what?
I'm sick of your shit.

48:32.510 --> 48:33.730
- You know what...
- (laughing)

48:33.930 --> 48:34.810
Wh-What? You think it's funny?

48:35.010 --> 48:35.980
You think it's funny? Think it's funny?

48:36.180 --> 48:37.190
David, come on, okay?

48:37.390 --> 48:39.400
We're on a telephone 3,000 miles apart.

48:39.590 --> 48:41.940
We're two out-of-shape, middle-aged guys.
This is a little ridiculous.

48:42.140 --> 48:43.480
I'm not out of shape.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.650
I'm in great shape. I'm in great shape.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.940
When's the last time you saw me?

48:47.140 --> 48:48.150
I'm in fucking great shape.

48:48.340 --> 48:49.560
I believe you, David.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.690
Unless you make an offer
to Michael and close him,

48:52.890 --> 48:55.600
I will personally ensure
that no client of this agency

48:55.800 --> 48:57.310
ever signs a contract with Nike,

48:57.510 --> 49:01.270
and Nike will be out of
the basketball business permanently.

49:01.470 --> 49:02.560
And so will you.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.330
What if we do make the deal?

49:05.750 --> 49:07.750
You and I will be best friends.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.660
It's Monday.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.160
I-I'm lost.

49:15.950 --> 49:17.350
They're coming to Beaverton, Columbo.

49:17.550 --> 49:18.560
Don't make me say it twice.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.600
They're c-- they're coming out?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.600
They're coming-- I'm saying it
twice now, you fucking idiot.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.100
- O-Okay, all right.
- (sighs) Don't get ahead of yourself.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.520
Michael's not gonna be excited
to be there, okay?

49:27.720 --> 49:29.520
His mother's making him go.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.650
I understand.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.150
- Hey, David.
- Yeah?

49:33.340 --> 49:35.310
- I'll see you Monday.
- Hey, fuck you!

49:35.510 --> 49:37.080
Fuck!

49:38.120 --> 49:39.620
KATRINA:
Sonny?

49:40.660 --> 49:42.020
Phil wants to see you in his office.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.980
Uh, I'll... (stammers)

49:45.180 --> 49:46.520
G-Give me like ten, 15 minutes.

49:46.720 --> 49:47.980
No, he said now.

49:48.180 --> 49:49.350
(typewriter clacking, dinging)

49:49.550 --> 49:53.060
("Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer playing)

49:53.260 --> 49:55.850
Sonny, did you go
to Michael Jordan's house

49:56.050 --> 49:58.270
and sit down with his mother
and schedule a meeting

49:58.470 --> 50:00.560
with his family and this company
for Monday?

50:00.760 --> 50:02.810
We need a firm offer.

50:03.010 --> 50:05.980
You don't have authorization
to make any offer.

50:06.180 --> 50:10.060
I understand from his representation
that he'll be expecting the entire amount:

50:10.260 --> 50:11.940
250 a year, five years guaranteed.

50:12.140 --> 50:13.480
We can't afford that offer.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.020
Do you understand
how irresponsible that is?

50:15.220 --> 50:16.100
That's not.

50:16.300 --> 50:17.690
Converse is gonna come in at a hundred.

50:17.890 --> 50:19.690
You know the Germans
will easily match 250.

50:19.890 --> 50:20.770
Sonny, I'm the boss.

50:20.970 --> 50:22.310
I'm the CEO of this company, okay?

50:22.510 --> 50:24.020
I'm the CEO guy.
You do what I tell you to do.

50:24.220 --> 50:25.440
- You work for me.
- If you want to mean something

50:25.640 --> 50:27.350
in the basketball world, you got to spend.

50:27.550 --> 50:28.900
Nothing in life is free, Phil.

50:29.090 --> 50:31.440
Tell that to the college kids you keep
giving our shoes away to for free.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.440
That's working.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.600
- That's a good idea.
- Is it?

50:33.800 --> 50:34.900
How do you know it's working?

50:35.090 --> 50:36.020
It's theoretical value.
It can't be measured.

50:36.220 --> 50:37.150
It's a typical Sonny value.

50:37.340 --> 50:38.600
And what was my first idea?

50:38.800 --> 50:40.940
A high school all-star game.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.230
Now every single company has

50:42.430 --> 50:43.980
their own branded
high school all-star game.

50:44.180 --> 50:46.520
I'm giving away these ideas, Phil, free.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.520
That's the problem is
you see them as your ideas.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.650
It's about you and yourself and your ego.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.560
There is no self.
There's just the nonself.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.940
- The nonself?
- That's right.

50:54.140 --> 50:56.270
Does the Dalai Lama have
a grape-colored Porsche, Phil?

50:56.470 --> 50:58.100
You fucking asshole, Sonny.

50:58.300 --> 51:00.150
Are you trying to be an asshole?

51:00.340 --> 51:02.350
Look, all I can do is give you
my recommendation.

51:02.550 --> 51:04.270
This is the strongest one I've ever had.

51:04.470 --> 51:05.520
I'll tell you what.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.020
If you want to go start
your own company...

51:07.220 --> 51:08.230
My own company. That's what I want.

51:08.430 --> 51:09.400
- ...I wish you luck.
- Start my own company.

51:09.590 --> 51:10.770
- Yeah.
- You can be impetuous.

51:10.970 --> 51:12.650
You can make mistakes.
You can be reckless.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.350
But let me tell you
how we do things at this company.

51:15.550 --> 51:18.730
We make careful, strategic,
measured, thoughtful decisions

51:18.930 --> 51:19.980
with knowable outcomes.

51:20.180 --> 51:23.100
Right, knowable and thoughtful
and careful.

51:23.300 --> 51:24.690
How'd you ever build this place, Phil?

51:24.890 --> 51:27.450
Fuck you, Sonny.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.900
(sighs) Okay.

51:31.090 --> 51:32.600
You know?

51:32.800 --> 51:34.870
You did it. You got the meeting.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.060
You don't need a firm offer
to prep a meeting.

51:38.260 --> 51:40.400
So unless I give you
the go-ahead Sunday night,

51:40.590 --> 51:42.810
you don't have a budget,
a Michael Jordan line

51:43.010 --> 51:44.440
- or a firm offer to make on Monday.
- (sighs)

51:44.640 --> 51:46.770
So I'll think about it,
and if I change my mind,

51:46.970 --> 51:48.690
I'll just cancel it.

51:48.890 --> 51:51.020
SONNY: I don't know how much more
emphatically I can say this.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.730
If we don't make this deal,

51:52.930 --> 51:54.770
I don't know what my place is
at this company.

53:58.930 --> 54:01.150
Uh, Converse are plain,
ordinary shoes, right?

54:01.340 --> 54:03.060
Every player wears the same one.

54:03.260 --> 54:04.440
What we do with this one is,

54:04.640 --> 54:06.810
rather than have the athlete
wear one of our shoes,

54:07.010 --> 54:10.020
we create the shoe around the athlete.

54:10.220 --> 54:15.150
So the shoe is
a physical manifestation of the individual

54:15.340 --> 54:20.330
rather than the individual
as emblem of the corporate entity?

54:21.620 --> 54:22.690
Something like that.

54:22.890 --> 54:25.650

54:25.840 --> 54:28.770
speak as an individual,

54:28.970 --> 54:31.850
market to a mass audience

54:32.050 --> 54:35.730
and be the most beautiful shoe
known to mankind.

54:35.930 --> 54:37.400
Yes.

54:37.590 --> 54:39.480
Form or function?

54:39.680 --> 54:41.540
Uh...

54:42.580 --> 54:46.270
Uh, something can be beautiful
or it can be practical.

54:46.470 --> 54:47.410
Rarely both.

54:48.450 --> 54:50.750
Come up with something new.

54:52.620 --> 54:56.400
Humans have been wearing shoes
for thousands of years,

54:56.590 --> 55:01.230
and the design has
substantively changed once:

55:01.430 --> 55:05.950
when they differentiated between
the right and the left shoe.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.660
That was 600 years ago.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.020
Let's go form.

don't bother coming in Sunday.

Michael Jordan.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.520

56:33.720 --> 56:37.150
there are only a few other players
that gave me that feeling.

56:37.340 --> 56:40.150
And those players are here at Converse.

56:40.340 --> 56:41.520
(chuckles):
It is that simple.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.400
Michael, we're gonna treat you
like our superstars

56:48.680 --> 56:51.150

Well, what could hold more appeal
than the shoe worn by

56:53.680 --> 56:55.480
the best players in the game?

56:55.680 --> 57:00.190
Tradition and history
are paramount at Converse.

57:00.390 --> 57:02.480
You have an impressive roster.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.810
Best three players in the league
in Magic Johnson,

57:05.010 --> 57:06.900
Larry Bird, Julius Erving.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.690
But another way of looking at this is

57:09.890 --> 57:13.270

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:40.440
about 80% of our shoes
in South Korea, Taiwan.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.020

ambivalent about that,

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.350

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.690

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.020
But she's-- so she's seven,

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.900
and, um, and I-I started

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:19.350
bringing her free Nikes every Sunday.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.810
And, you know, it's-it's the thing
that she looks forward to

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.350
about seeing me, you know.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:26.690
So I-I bring her the shoes,
so she loves me.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.060
She got about 60 now.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.020

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.560
it makes me mean something to her.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.560
And if Phil shuts this division down,

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.100
I'm ashamed to say
I-I'd still buy the shoes,

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.000
even if it meant giving Phil money
and we make them in Taiwan.

01:02:47.290 --> 01:02:48.600
But I don't want to do that.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.980

and I want my job.

seven minutes late to the meeting.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.850
Absolutely not.
I'm the CEO of the company.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:48.060
I have to be there the whole time.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.560
No, it-it looks desperate.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.690
And Phil has a million things going on,
and the only way to show that

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:54.310
is if Phil comes in late to the meeting.

01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:57.690
It shows Phil took time out of
his very busy day for the Jordan family.

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.900
STRASSER: Might seem like
Michael Jordan's not a priority

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.150
- to the CEO of the company.
- KNIGHT: No. No.

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.900
Sonny... Sonny is-is
actually right about this.

01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:06.730
It makes Phil look more important.

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.600
And so if Phil's there,
he's more important.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.520
It's a more important meeting.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.190
I do see Sonny's point,
to be sure, but, uh...

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.060
We need to, uh, bind
and print the shoe design.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.940
- MOORE: How many?
- One.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.560
- Really?
- Yeah, just one.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.150
Uh, the second you have multiples,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.850
- it diminishes the value.
- Oh.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:25.940
- KNIGHT: I like it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.310
We have a video, right?

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:28.730

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:30.690

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:53.690
Yes, we do. But I-I thought
that the-the Jordans might be

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:56.850
interested in how we see
the future here at Nike

01:15:57.050 --> 01:16:01.900
and how we would market Michael
as a person

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:07.480
and not just another guy
wearing someone's shoes.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.690
And there are no limits here at Nike.

01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:13.560
You can do just about anything.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.310
- How'd that get in there?
- (chuckles)

01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:18.400
WHITE:
We believe Michael can represent something

01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:20.900
more than just a basketball player.

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.520
Hell, you can find them anywhere.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.560
(chuckles): You're looking at
one busted-up one right here.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.190
And Rob wants
to really market our players,

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.310
and this has never been
really done before.

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.100
That's one of the things
we've-we've really pioneered.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.100
Do you have a video?

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.190
Shall we? Good. Great.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.150
Uh, let's watch a movie here.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.810
So, uh, let me kill these. Yeah.

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.690
Um, well, I'll let it speak for itself.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.150
I just... I'll hit go here

Sonny, what the fuck are you doing?

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.690
Just forget about the shoes.
Forget about the money.

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:47.730
You're gonna make enough money
it's not gonna matter.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.730
Money can buy you almost anything.

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:52.540
It can't buy you immortality.
That you have to earn.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.650
(Sonny sighs)

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.270
I'm gonna look you in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell you the future.

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:03.690
You were cut from
your high school basketball team.

01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:06.560
You willed your way to the NBA.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.980
You're gonna win championships.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.600
It's an American story,

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.100
and that's why Americans
are gonna love it.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.480
People are gonna build you up.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.600
God, are they going to.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.730
Because when you're great and new,
we love you.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.480
Man, we'll build you into something
that doesn't even exist.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.870
You're gonna change the fucking world.

01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:29.650
But you know what?

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.310
Once they've built you
as high as they possibly can,

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:34.900
they're gonna tear you back down.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.230
It's the most predictable pattern.

01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.440
We build you into something
that doesn't exist,

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.150
<i>and that means you have to try</i>
<i>to be that thing.</i>

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.350
All day, every day.

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.650
That's how it works.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.040
And we do it again and again and again.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.120
And I'm gonna tell you the truth.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.190
<i>You're gonna be attacked,</i>

01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:56.230

A lot of people can climb that mountain.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.500

<i>Who are you, Michael?</i>

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.020
That will be the defining question
of your life.

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.770
And I think you already know the answer.

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.700
And that's why we're all here.

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:37.690
A shoe is just a shoe

01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:39.690
until somebody steps into it.

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:42.290
Then it has meaning.

01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:46.730
The rest of us just want a chance
to touch that greatness.

01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:49.690
We need you in these shoes
not so you have meaning in your life

01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:52.020
but so that we have meaning in ours.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.190
Everyone at this table will be forgotten

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.900

01:19:58.090 --> 01:19:59.520
Except for you.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.900
You're gonna be remembered forever,

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.650
because some things are eternal.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.440
You're Michael Jordan,

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.620
and your story is
gonna make us want to fly.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.650
Mr. Falk's already shared this with you,

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.270
but I wanted to give it to you in person,

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:31.810
um, because it's
the most significant offer

01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:34.500

to any athlete.

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:44.150

in a similar range.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.940
Nonetheless, Nike has long been

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.690
in search of its basketball star.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:56.620
We believe you are that star.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.060
Well, thank you, Mr. Vaccaro,

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.270

at everyone's numbers,

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:28.100
and, uh, we'll let you know
when we let you know.

What the fuck is that thing
w-with the fines, by the way?

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.100
It doesn't matter.
W-- I think we have him,

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.400
and we just have to wait and see.

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:48.600

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.270

I'm not-- I think I've done
something impressive.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.400
You know?

01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:01.980
I mean, it was a good speech.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.900

he accepted it yet, though,

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.190
so we might still have time.

01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:01.940

to give you the heads-up.

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.730
and the shoe will be named
for Michael and our family.

01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:51.650
- What-what?
- Yes.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.060
- Uh, really?
- (chuckles)

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.900
Mr. Vaccaro, don't sound so surprised.

01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.900
No, this is-- no, great decision.

01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:58.230
Uh, uh, you're not gonna regret it,

01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.190
and I-I can give you
my personal guarantee...

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:01.270
I'm not finished.

01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:04.560
No. Yeah. Ex-Excuse me. Sorry, go ahead.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.560
Now, we are willing to accept the deal
and commit right away

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.060
but with one minor provision.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:12.560
- Name it.
- It's nothing, really.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.940
It's so obvious that its omission,
I assume,

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.150
from the term sheet was a clerical error.

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.270
I'm sure it was.

01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:21.270
Michael will get
a percentage of the revenue

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:24.250
of the sale of each shoe that is sold.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.400
I'm sorry?

01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:33.150
Not all Nike shoes,
just the ones with his name on them.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.560
Oh, well, uh, Mrs. Jordan,

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.850
so that's not
how the business works at all.

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:41.100
I mean, I-I understand the assumption,
but, um, what...

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.060
The-the athletes get a licensing fee--

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.980
in this case, obviously,
a groundbreaking fee--

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.520
but they don't actually participate
in the gross sales of the shoe.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.400
Because Nike's a public company,
so that-- it-- they can't--

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:55.480
That would disrupt the industry,
and they wouldn't-- they, um--

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.270
Th-There's a-a whole other set
of economics around this.

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:59.400
It's very complicated.

01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:00.770
Yeah, I'm sure it's quite complicated.

01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:02.350
It's not realistic, but, um--

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:06.810
This way, it's cleaner 'cause you know
and the family knows

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:08.900
exactly what's gonna come in every year...

01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:10.560
Well, that's not his concern.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.730
- Um, okay. Uh-huh.
- All right?

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:17.440
His concern is that,
in order for the shoe to be meaningful,

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.190
in order for young people,
many not of real means,

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:22.190
to want to go out and spend the money

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:26.270
that they worked all week,
two weeks at the mall for,

01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:29.730
then Michael has to create
the meaning in that shoe.

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.770
His name is on that shoe.

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:33.900
Yeah, so actually we think
that's a benefit to him

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:37.100
because his likeness
gets marketed by Nike.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.560
No. His likeness, his name

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.190
is not in any way meaningful to Nike

01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:45.270
unless he scores 40 points a night,
every night,

01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.150
beats Akeem as Rookie of the Year,

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.100
makes All-Star and All-NBA team.

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.270
(sighs) Okay, that would be exceptional.

01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:55.480
And-and, um, you know, it is the NBA,

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.480
so these are the best of the best.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.230
Well, he has to be better.

01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:01.690
He will win championships,
multiple championships,

01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:02.940
final MVPs.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.150
I know my son.

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.770
All-Star selection, All-Star MVP,

01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:08.440
Defensive Player of the Year...

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.270
But, ma'am, with respect,

01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:14.060
Sidney Moncrief is
the Defensive Player of the Year.

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.900
Adrian Dantley won the scoring title.

01:29:16.090 --> 01:29:17.230
They're not...

01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:19.940
Y-You don't get to be
Magic and Michael Cooper.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.310
- It's basketball.
- Yeah, but if he does it,

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:24.060
he deserves to be compensated.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.020
You eat, we eat. That's all he's asking.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.270
That's a fair point,

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:31.100
but that's just not
how the business works.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.810
I mean, they-they invest the capital,

01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:35.060
then they get the reward,
and that's how it goes.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:36.980
Well, maybe that needs to change.

01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.810
Because if he does
what I think he's gonna do,

01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:41.730
what you also think he's gonna do

01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:44.060
and what Michael knows he's gonna do,

01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:47.230
then it won't be the NBA promoting my son,
I promise you.

01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.850
It'll be the other way around.

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.850
And in that case, he deserves a piece.

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:54.810
Mrs. Jordan, I...

01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:56.100
I understand what you're saying.

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.080
I... I actually agree with you.

01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:03.940
But that's just not
how it goes in this life.

01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:06.850
(sighs) People like your son,

01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:11.150
people who work for a living,
they don't let us own anything.

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.480
We take the best we can get.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.770
And this is a great deal.

01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:16.440
This is the biggest deal

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.230
this company has ever
offered anyone by far.

01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:22.500
Michael could blow out his knee next week.

01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:28.560
Mr. Vaccaro, I agree
that the business is unfair.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.150
It's unfair to my son.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.690
It's unfair to people like you.

01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:36.440
But every once in a while,

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.020
someone comes along
that's so extraordinary

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.440
that it forces those
reluctant to part with

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.560
some of that wealth to do so,
not out of charity

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:50.230
but out of greed,
because they are so very special.

01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.650
And even more rare,
that person demands to be treated

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.270
according to their worth

01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:58.500
because they understand
what they are worth.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.410

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:06.520

Is it me who believes
in Michael, his name,

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:14.060

of who he is

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:17.190

Yes, it is.

Okay.

Now, I'm gonna put it to you plain
once again.

that will be forgotten in a year,

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.020
when someone makes a fucking play
on you, you know?

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.270
(chuckles)
Well, that's very nice of you, David,

01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:22.850
but I actually think
this is one of those deals

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:24.850
that's gonna work out for everybody.

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.190
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh, what's Adidas doing?

01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:28.900
- They're pivoting.
- Yeah? To who?

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.940
Mel Turpin.

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:32.350
- Interesting.
- He's not a client.

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:33.940
How's Phil? How's he feeling?

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:35.440
- Great.
- It's a big step.

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.100
Big steps are how he made this place.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.770
You know, you better get me on speed dial

01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:40.940
- for the next five years. (chuckles)
- Oh, please.

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.230
Howard's gonna take over with Mike.

01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:45.100
You'll be gone in a year.
No more rabbits to chase.

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.100
Well, that's the thing
about rabbits, you know?

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.020
You never know 'cause
they just make more rabbits.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.560
(laughs)

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.000
Yeah, they do.

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.440
Well, I'd say it's been a pleasure

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.060
doing business with you, David,
but it never really is.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.310
FALK:
Nor should it be.

01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:02.560
I don't have friends.
I have clients, okay?

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.350
That's why I'm a great fucking agent.

01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:08.150
I'm gonna sell my business one day,
and I am gonna be a very rich man.

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.650
I will eat alone, but I'll be rich
and so will my clients.

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.980
Then I'll worry about friends.

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:15.730
Well, you call me the next time
you have a once-in-a-generation talent.

01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:17.150
I'm thinking of signing Ewing.

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.500
- What do you think?
- Pat?

01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:22.020
He immigrated from Jamaica
to a little house

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.980
off Auburn Street
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.770
when he was 13 years old.

01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:28.770
He'd never played basketball.
The kid played soccer.

01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:30.690
And Mike Jarvis spotted him

01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:32.350
in the hallways
at Cambridge Rindge and Latin.

01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.400
He recruited him.

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:35.100
That team won three state titles.

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:37.980
I think he's the exact type of player
who should be wearing Nikes,

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.650
and I think you can sign whoever you want
after the deal we just made.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.100
You're welcome.

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.850
You should be thanking me.

01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:46.020
F-For what?

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.480
For coming up with the name of the shoe.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.230
- Air Jordan?
- Yeah.

01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:51.190
Nah, that was Pete. Bye.

01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:52.770

01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:17.230

Why?

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.060
Just... (exhales)

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.080

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.480
What are you forgiving yourself for?

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.770
I think it's possible

01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:31.730
we may have set
a very dangerous precedent.

01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:34.600
Now every athlete's
gonna want a percentage.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.160
Next thing, they'll all want equity and...

01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:42.270
Fuck it.

Too many cows.

01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:48.270
If we ruin the business,
at least we had fun doing it.

01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:50.730
Felt like the old Nike days
for a little while.

01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:51.870
Yeah.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.060
You know, I thought
it was pronounced "Nicky"

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.480
first time I saw the word.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.520
I had a really strong instinct

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.900
we should call the company Dimension Six.

01:40:01.090 --> 01:40:03.770
You think it would've been successful
with that name?

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:05.850
No.

01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:07.810
Ah, you name it after
the goddess of victory,

01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.560
it's probably more appealing
to competitive athletes.

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.730
We just did that 'cause
the consultants told us

01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:14.480
people like four-letter words.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.790
I like four-letter words.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.440
Hey, what about the swoosh?

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.980
Supposed to be a sound.

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.560
Sound of what?

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.980
I don't know.

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:30.310
I paid Carolyn Davidson
$35 for that design in 1971.
