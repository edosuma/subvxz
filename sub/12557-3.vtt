OWE THE GOOD DOCTOR

TO FORGIVE HIM FOR ALL THAT

DESPITE THE FACT THAT VVHAT THE
DOCTOR THINKS OF AS FARSIGHTEDNESS

01:55.532 --> 01:58.900

DOCTOR'S BIRTHDAY,

02:11.715 --> 02:13.456

ANY CELLAR, REMEMBER?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.599
THE ADVANTAGES OF
MODERN ARCHITECTURE.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.100
WE GOT THE ONLY BRAND-
NEW HOUSE ON THE BLOCK.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.681

ALL THE WONDERS OF MODERN
SCIENCE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

10:15.865 --> 10:17.026
EXCEPT THAT THING THAT'S
HEADING FOR US RIGHT NOVV.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.028

THE KIDS OVER HERE?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.616

10:23.665 --> 10:25.622
WE'RE SITTING DUCKS
OVER THERE--

10:25.667 --> 10:27.123
NO PROTECTION AT ALL.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.545

YOU CAN USE
OUR BASEMENT.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.090
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
VVE CAN SURVIVE!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.758
I DON'T HAVE
ANY ROOM, JERRY.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.176
THERE'S NOT NEAR ENOUGH
ROOM OR SUPPLIES.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.879
IT'S DESIGNED

10:44.185 --> 10:45.562
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP
MY FAMILY ALIVE.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
WE WON'T USE
ANY OF YOUR STUFF.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.474
WHAT ABOUT AIR?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.226

10:57.115 --> 10:58.526
WHEN THAT DOOR GETS
CLOSED AND LOCKED

10:58.616 --> 11:00.402
IT STAYS CLOSED

11:00.493 --> 11:02.325
THERE'LL BE RADIATION AND
HEAVEN KNOVVS VVHAT ELSE.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.621

VVHILE VVE BURN TO A CRISP?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.703
THAT'S NO
CONCERN OF MINE.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.959
RIGHT NOVV IT'S MY FAMILY
I HA\/E TO VVORRY ABOUT.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.835
DO YOU THINK I'M
GOING TO STAND BY

11:16.885 --> 11:18.171
AND WATCH WHILE MY WIFE
AND CHILDREN DIE IN AGONY?

11:18.261 --> 11:19.751
I'M NOT
GOING TO DO IT!

11:19.846 --> 11:22.838
BILL, I'M NOT

11:31.065 --> 11:32.851
<i>FOR MAYBE A FEW HOURS A WEEK,</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:34.357

GUTS TO FACE THAT.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.361
<i>SO NOW YOU'VE GOT TO FACE

11:46.456 --> 11:47.867
SO, GOD, PLEASE, GOD

11:47.916 --> 11:49.247
IT'S OUT
OF MY HANDS.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.824
IT'S SIMPLY
OUT OF MY HANDS.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.206
IT'S GOT TO BE GOD.
IT'S GOT TO BE GOD.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.040
THEY'RE ALREADY

HIMSELF IN.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.128
HE'S GOT

11:59.219 --> 12:01.256
WE HAVE NO WINDOWS
IN HALF THE BASEMENT

12:01.346 --> 12:02.677
AND I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING

12:02.764 --> 12:04.254
TO PLUG THEM

12:04.349 --> 12:06.306
AND THE BASEMENT
WON'T HELP, ANYWAY.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.769
I CAN'T HELP
YOU, MARTY.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.887
HE'S DOWNSTAIRS?

I CAN'T!

12:48.559 --> 12:50.391
I CAN'T

12:53.314 --> 12:54.554
I REALLY DO.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.606
YOU PROBABLY
WILL SURVIVE,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.606
BUT YOU'LL HAVE
BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.437
YOU'RE A DOCTOR!

13:01.531 --> 13:05.115
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE!
BILL!

13:05.201 --> 13:08.114
<i>[pounding on door

13:17.380 --> 13:23.251
THAT WAS A
MILLION YEARS AGO.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.837
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.797
MARTY!

13:28.891 --> 13:31.144
GET OUT OF HERE!

13:31.185 --> 13:32.391
DO YOU HEAR ME?

13:36.399 --> 13:37.480
MARTY!

13:58.921 --> 14:02.255
<i>(Jerry) THEN HE SLAMMED THE

14:03.593 --> 14:04.674
JERRY, ASK
HIM AGAIN.

14:04.719 --> 14:05.880
LET'S GO.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.347
JERRY, ASK

14:07.388 --> 14:09.220
ASK HIM AGAIN!

14:09.307 --> 14:11.173
<i>(woman) PLEASE, I DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE.</i>

14:11.267 --> 14:12.849
<i>PLEASE, FRANK,
LET'S GO HOME!</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:14.471
THERE'S NO TIME! IT'LL

14:14.562 --> 14:15.927
<i>(Jerry) IT'S NO USE, FRANK.</i>

14:16.022 --> 14:17.353
<i>HE WON'T LET
ANYBODY IN.</i>

14:17.398 --> 14:18.684
WHAT'LL WE DO?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.265
WE OUGHT TO
FIND ONE BASEMENT

14:20.360 --> 14:21.646
AND GO TO
WORK ON THAT.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.192
POOL ALL
OF OUR STUFF.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.394
IT JUST
ISN'T FAIR!

14:24.489 --> 14:25.900
HE'S PERFECTLY SAFE

14:25.990 --> 14:27.526
WHILE OUR KIDS
HAVE TO SIT AROUND

14:27.617 --> 14:29.358
AND WAIT FOR
A BOMB TO DROP!

14:29.452 --> 14:31.534
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GO DOWN THERE

14:31.579 --> 14:33.411
AND BREAK
DOWN THE DOOR!

14:33.498 --> 14:36.536
FRANK, FRANK--WAIT
A MINUTE, FRANK!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.120
FRANK, WAIT
A MINUTE!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.418
VVE CAN'T ALL FIT IN
THAT BOMB SHELTER.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.371
WE'D BE CRAZY
TO EVEN TRY.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.165
(Marty) WHY DON'T WE PICK
OUT ONE FAMILY-- DRAW LOTS?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.465
I KEEP
TELLING YOU,

14:46.552 --> 14:47.804
HE WON'T LET
ANYBODY IN.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.594
WE COULD ALL
GO DOWN THERE

14:49.680 --> 14:52.342
AND TELL HIM THE VVHOLE
STREET IS AGAINST HIM.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.844
WHAT GOOD
WOULD IT DO?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.551
EVEN IF YOU BREAK
DOVVN THE DOOR,

14:55.603 --> 14:56.889
WE CAN'T ALL FIT.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.428
WE'D BE
KILLING EVERYBODY.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.389
IF IT SAVES EVEN
ONE OF MY KIDS

15:00.441 --> 15:02.057
I CALL THAT
A GOOD REASON.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.147
JERRY, YOU KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANY OF US.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.523
YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.195
GO DOWN THERE AGAIN.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.318
TALK TO HIM,
PLEAD WITH HIM.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.901
TELL HIM TO PICK
OUT ONE FAMILY.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.445
WE'LL DRAW LOTS
OR SOMETHING.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.406
ONE FAMILY.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.574
MEANING YOURS,
MARTY, HUH?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.163
WHY NOT?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.916
I'VE GOT A THREE-
MONTH-OLD BABY.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.299
IS YOUR BABY ANY MORE
PRECIOUS THAN ONE OF MY KIDS?

15:27.385 --> 15:29.422
I NEVER SAID THAT.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.345
LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE
ABOUT VVHO DESERVES TO Ll\/E--

15:32.432 --> 15:33.763

15:33.850 --> 15:34.635
TAKE IT EASY.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.851
LET GO!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.551
THAT'S THE
WAY IT IS

15:37.645 --> 15:39.352
WHEN THE FOREIGNERS
COME OVER HERE--

15:39.439 --> 15:41.021
PUSHY, GRABBY,

15:48.489 --> 15:49.866
WEISS, FOR MY DOUGH,

15:49.949 --> 15:52.407
YOU'RE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE LIST!

15:52.493 --> 15:54.359
KEEP IT UP, YOU'LL
SLAUGHTER EACH OTHER!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.286
MARTY.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.741
MARTY. MARTY, PLEASE.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.322
GO DOWN TO THE SHELTER.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.203

16:01.294 --> 16:02.955
I'VE ALREADY
ASKED HIM.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.171
<i>[whirring outside]</i>

16:04.255 --> 16:05.745

ANY GOOD!

16:05.840 --> 16:07.456
SEARCHLIGHTS. IT MUST
BE COMING CLOSER.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.881

OPEN UP THAT DOOR.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.145

THING LEFT TO DO!

16:26.235 --> 16:28.818
FRANK'S RIGHT. COME
