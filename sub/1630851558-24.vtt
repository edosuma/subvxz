WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.200
Previously
on this season

00:05.233 --> 00:06.834
of Gold Rush.

00:06.867 --> 00:09.767
We're hunting for ground.
We need grounds.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.600
With the competition
for Klondike gold

00:12.634 --> 00:14.400
reaching a fever pitch,

00:14.433 --> 00:17.000
27-year-old Parker Schnabel

00:17.033 --> 00:18.433
took a massive risk

00:18.467 --> 00:20.100
on a wild card claim.

00:20.734 --> 00:22.500
We've never gone this deep.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.700
Shut her down, shut her down.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.834
This season, we put
a lot of our eggs

00:26.867 --> 00:28.934
in the Mud Mountain basket

00:28.967 --> 00:30.834
and it needs to be
making money.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.967
Flush with ground,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.600
Tony Beets spent
five million dollars

00:37.634 --> 00:38.667
on equipment...

00:43.900 --> 00:46.600
...but lost his most
productive claim.

01:01.367 --> 01:04.033
We've got a bedrock hole
here at 210 feet.

01:04.066 --> 01:05.800
Rick Ness

01:05.834 --> 01:07.667
doubled down on his decision

01:07.700 --> 01:09.166
to leave the Klondike

01:09.200 --> 01:11.400
with a one million dollar gamble...

01:11.433 --> 01:13.333
This is one of
the scariest things
I've ever done.

01:13.367 --> 01:14.500
I'm gonna to go broke.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.166
...on the deepest claim
he's ever mined.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.367
Stop! Stop!
Oh,

01:20.367 --> 01:21.567
sakes!

01:21.600 --> 01:23.767
The payoff at the bottom,
it could be a life-changing.

01:26.033 --> 01:30.100
And after a disastrous
rookie season,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.467
Fred and his band of
combat veterans

01:32.500 --> 01:33.867
headed to the Yukon,

01:35.333 --> 01:39.100
determined to earn
their mining stripes.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.266
That's about the biggest pay
we had last season times ten.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.734
Come hell or high water,

01:43.767 --> 01:45.166
the misfits are coming out
on top.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Now,

01:48.767 --> 01:50.333
the final push...

01:50.367 --> 01:51.400
Kill the plant.

01:51.433 --> 01:52.867
What did you do?

01:54.967 --> 01:57.133
I just don't know
how much more we can fight.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.367
I'm in the pond.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.967
The walls
caving in.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.400
Are you kidding me?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.834
With just over 1600 ounces
of gold,

02:24.867 --> 02:27.600
we're still way off our
2000 ounce season goal.

02:27.634 --> 02:28.867
We got...

02:28.900 --> 02:30.600
..a bunch of
snow overnight.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.233
I'm sure
there's a lots of people

02:33.266 --> 02:35.200
that would call this pretty, but...

02:35.233 --> 02:37.300
...I call it the last
thing we need right now.

02:38.266 --> 02:40.867
Rick Ness is running
out of time.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.300
He's 190 feet down

02:45.333 --> 02:46.767
in his Rally Valley cut

02:47.867 --> 02:50.166
on the best gold
he's ever seen.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.467
With winter breathing down
his neck...

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
Kyle, come on.

02:58.467 --> 03:00.767
...it's time
to put the pedal

03:00.800 --> 03:02.200
to the metal.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.900
Obviously, you guys are
standing in the same
storm that I am.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.600
quick
winter snuck up man.

03:06.634 --> 03:09.033
This is way earlier than
I've seen it in a long time.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.233
Of all the years
for this to happen,

03:11.266 --> 03:12.667
uh, give me a break.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.967
We dug this big hole.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.533
This is the best pay
we've ever had.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.000
With this weather like this

03:22.033 --> 03:24.100
- we aren't--
- Gonna have time to run it all this year.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.166
Is there any way
we can push this plan

03:28.200 --> 03:29.333
any harder than
what we have been?

03:30.367 --> 03:32.567
You gotta add another loader,
right?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.166
Wouldn't that work?
Clear tailings.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.400
Grab a bucket of pay
every now and then.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.967
Maybe crank her up 400 yards

03:38.000 --> 03:39.634
and see if we can keep up
with it?

03:39.667 --> 03:40.967
Four hundred yards
an hour?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.100
It's a push but...

03:42.133 --> 03:44.600
- Pretty sweet to do that.
- Yeah.

03:44.634 --> 03:47.100
I mean, that feeder will do
over 800 yards an hour.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.266
The plant, you know,
we're already 300 yards
an hour.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.166
There's room.
There's room on that deck.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.567
There's room
in that sluice box.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.333
It's worth a shot.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.333
We're gonna have our work
cut out, trying to
keep that baby

03:56.367 --> 03:57.667
full of pay.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.200
Yeah, well,
that's how it is
in the end of the season.

04:00.233 --> 04:01.667
Wouldn't have it
any other way, right?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.333
Should we get after it?

04:03.367 --> 04:04.600
I say we should.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.166
Let's get
after it then.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.634
I want to crank up
to 400 yards an hour.

04:16.667 --> 04:17.967
The only way
to keep that amount

04:18.000 --> 04:19.066
fed through this plant

04:19.100 --> 04:21.066
was to be having two loaders,

04:21.100 --> 04:22.133
load and pay.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.066
You know, one full-time,
just dumping

04:24.100 --> 04:25.900
scoop after scoop
in the feeder

04:25.934 --> 04:26.967
and then a second one

04:27.000 --> 04:28.767
alternating between tailings

04:28.800 --> 04:30.600
and dumping a scoop of pay
in the hopper

04:30.634 --> 04:32.300
as it goes by every time
as well.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.000
Doing a little dance like that
it's actually,

04:34.033 --> 04:35.767
it's working pretty good.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.000
I'll come in from behind you

04:37.033 --> 04:39.200
there with another scoop
there, dad.

04:39.233 --> 04:40.800
Okay, I'll run up there
and take care of that

04:40.834 --> 04:42.734
- then I'll go do the waste.
- Perfect.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.433
It's great
having my dad here.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.200
He started operating engineers

04:46.233 --> 04:47.700
when he was like 18 years old.

04:47.734 --> 04:48.867
He had experience before that,

04:48.900 --> 04:51.333
working for his dad,
my grandpa.

04:51.367 --> 04:52.700
So, he's got

04:52.734 --> 04:53.934
more experience

04:53.967 --> 04:55.767
than most of the crew here combined.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.533
I love
coming up here helping him

04:58.567 --> 04:59.900
for a few weeks,
but I'll tell you what,

04:59.934 --> 05:03.133
I don't think I can handle
an entire season
of gold mining.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.567
It is brutal.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.900
Give him credit.
He has a great work ethic.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.200
He busts his ass to try to

05:10.233 --> 05:11.600
make things work.

05:11.634 --> 05:13.033
You're at
the end of the season.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.100
We're stressed for time.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.066
If my dad and I
are hanging out,

05:16.100 --> 05:17.400
it's hanging out at work,

05:17.433 --> 05:19.133
stuffing dirt through
a large plant.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.166
What's going on over there?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.133
Yeah, he, uh, this thing's

05:35.166 --> 05:37.300
throwing, uh,
low battery voltage code.

05:37.333 --> 05:38.533
Voltage is dropping.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.533
Sixteen volts right now
and going down

05:40.567 --> 05:42.000
and it's honking at me, um.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.800
I'm gonna have to go
and check this thing out.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.000
All right, uh...

05:47.033 --> 05:48.767
Maybe it's something simple.
I hope it is.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.266
Thanks, dad.

05:53.934 --> 05:56.000
Hey, Kyle, we're having
a problem with one of these loaders,

05:56.033 --> 05:57.634
so we're gonna have to dial
the plant back down

05:57.667 --> 05:58.700
to 300 yards an hour.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.333
Hopefully, uh,
my dad figures it out.

06:09.133 --> 06:10.400
Without
these two machines,

06:10.433 --> 06:12.066
it's gonna make it
nearly impossible

06:12.100 --> 06:13.100
to meet that goal.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.200
Rick's gear

06:15.233 --> 06:17.233
has been limping through
the season.

06:17.266 --> 06:19.300
Without a mechanic
on the crew,

06:19.333 --> 06:20.600
he needs his dad

06:20.634 --> 06:22.033
to keep it running.

06:22.066 --> 06:24.000
To get into
the meat and bones of
these machines, right,

06:24.033 --> 06:25.266
that's, it's over my head.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.300
I mean, you need a tech
like Kyle

06:27.333 --> 06:29.433
to do that kind of thing.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.100
Not having a mechanic
up here sucks.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.233
Just looking at the alternator
here real quick.

06:35.266 --> 06:37.266
Most times it's an alternator issue,

06:37.300 --> 06:38.400
a charging system issue.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.166
That's what the alternator
does, charges the battery.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.867
But, uh, everything looks good here.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.266
It looks like it's running
nice and cool.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.533
Connections are all good
on it.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.700
I'm going to go and look
at the other end of this thing

06:48.734 --> 06:50.800
and see if maybe
it's a bad ground
or something,

06:50.834 --> 06:52.600
maybe a battery issue.

06:52.634 --> 06:53.867
If big Rick

06:53.900 --> 06:56.200
can't fix the loader's
electrics,

06:56.233 --> 06:57.967
Rick will be leaving money

06:58.000 --> 06:59.734
in the Rally Valley bank.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.166
So,
this strong wire
is very, very loose

07:03.200 --> 07:04.400
and somewhat corroded.

07:04.433 --> 07:05.800
The dirt and the moisture

07:05.834 --> 07:07.166
gets in between the clamp

07:07.200 --> 07:09.467
from the cable and the post on
the battery and

07:09.500 --> 07:11.333
that'll sometimes
make 'em lose contact.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.734
So, what I'll do is

07:12.767 --> 07:15.200
clean up this battery post,
we'll tighten her back up

07:15.233 --> 07:17.433
and hopefully, that'll be the,

07:17.467 --> 07:18.700
the resolve for this issue.

07:19.667 --> 07:20.700
Good, right there.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.900
Hopefully all we need to do is
just get a jumpstart
on this thing,

07:24.934 --> 07:26.400
get it up and running.

07:26.433 --> 07:27.600
Okay, now, we'll give her...

07:31.033 --> 07:32.300
I'm gonna look and see, uh,

07:32.333 --> 07:33.533
what we're getting
for a charge.

07:34.567 --> 07:35.667
yeah!

07:37.467 --> 07:38.500
The system's charging,

07:38.533 --> 07:40.000
uh, it looks like
it's gonna hold voltage.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.000
Let's get this done.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.800
Rick, Rick, you got a copy?

07:50.300 --> 07:51.634
Yeah, go ahead.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.600
I found the problem
on this loader.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.567
yeah,
that's awesome news, dad.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.533
Yeah, hey, Kyle.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.266
Crank that plant
back up, buddy.

08:01.033 --> 08:02.033
Yee-haw!

08:03.367 --> 08:04.767
bricks
there for a minute,

08:04.800 --> 08:07.000
I thought we were turned out
for good for the rest
of the season.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.433
My dad and I are loading
this plant

08:10.467 --> 08:12.066
400 yards an hour

08:12.100 --> 08:14.066
and snow, ice,
whatever the it is,

08:14.100 --> 08:15.100
we're just gonna keep going.

08:35.033 --> 08:37.300
So, weather's closing in
on us here,

08:37.333 --> 08:38.900
it's been snowing
a little bit.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.333
It's been cold.

08:40.367 --> 08:41.934
You know, it's that end of season...

08:42.266 --> 08:44.000
...push.

08:44.033 --> 08:46.300
And everybody's doing
a really good job.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.867
With just days
left in his season,

08:48.900 --> 08:51.266
27-year-old Parker Schnabel

08:51.300 --> 08:54.600
has mined over
7,000 ounces of gold

08:54.634 --> 08:57.567
worth 12.8 million dollars.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.133
The best thing we can do is,

08:59.166 --> 09:01.000
you know, put as much gold
in the box

09:01.033 --> 09:02.834
right now as possible,

09:02.867 --> 09:04.400
make as much money as we can

09:04.433 --> 09:06.667
so that we can afford
a second operation

09:06.700 --> 09:07.700
next year.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.867
To beat
his previous record.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.467
Parker needs to pull in over

09:12.500 --> 09:14.734
350 ounces of gold

09:14.767 --> 09:15.834
before

09:15.867 --> 09:17.734
the brutal Yukon winter

09:17.767 --> 09:18.934
freezes them out.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.500
It's a really
good team right now

09:20.533 --> 09:23.000
and I've tried hard to

09:23.033 --> 09:24.533
give everybody as much

09:24.567 --> 09:26.200
autonomy as I can

09:26.233 --> 09:27.367
and it's worked great.

09:28.533 --> 09:29.767
Parker's leaned heavily

09:29.800 --> 09:31.934
on plant boss Tyson Lee

09:31.967 --> 09:34.333
and superstar mechanic
and foreman

09:34.367 --> 09:36.133
- Mitch Blaschke...
- Here we go!

09:36.166 --> 09:37.367
...who's running point

09:37.400 --> 09:39.367
on Mud Mountain.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.233
You know, we definitely
spent more money than
we did last year.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.567
I know that.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.433
Those big dozers
ripping all that mud
this year was,

09:46.467 --> 09:47.667
was very expensive.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.634
So far,

09:50.667 --> 09:53.634
he's dropped
5.4 million dollars,

09:53.667 --> 09:56.033
getting to the bottom
of Mud Mountain,

09:56.066 --> 09:58.567
and he still
hasn't broken even.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.200
But he's finally
on a hot pay streak.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.600
If there's enough of it,

10:02.634 --> 10:05.233
he could still win big.

10:05.266 --> 10:08.200
And the piece that's left,
though, is where
the best drilling was.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.600
So, there's still hope.

10:12.634 --> 10:15.233
- Good morning.
- 'sup, Postman?

10:15.266 --> 10:18.400
Now, Mitch
and operator Damien Browne

10:18.433 --> 10:20.500
are ready
to pull the last section

10:20.533 --> 10:22.600
of gold rich paydirt.

10:22.634 --> 10:26.333
All we got to do is get
the last of this pay
out of this road.

10:26.367 --> 10:29.634
We'll pull the dewatering
pump soon as this last pay
Big Red.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.033
- Mud Mountain cut's done.
- Sweet.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.634
We've been waiting
a long time to say that.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.700
Been waiting all season
to say that to us.

10:35.734 --> 10:37.166
Sluicifer should be
finishing up

10:37.200 --> 10:38.734
this week as well
down at Ken's.

10:38.767 --> 10:39.967
We'll get the trucks down here

10:40.000 --> 10:41.367
hopefully, it's got
a lot of gold in it.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.533
- Sweet.
- Have a good one.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.166
Thank you, Damien.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.567
Ever since
I got here this season,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.033
Parker told me
about this project
he wanted to take on,

10:50.066 --> 10:51.333
and it's been a huge one.

10:51.367 --> 10:52.734
You look at the equipment,
it's tore up,

10:52.767 --> 10:55.200
you look at the manpower
we've invested into this.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.500
And, you know, it's just
a matter of, is there
enough gold in here

10:58.533 --> 10:59.834
to make it all worthwhile?

11:01.166 --> 11:02.533
Ready to pull
this pump?

11:02.567 --> 11:04.133
- ready for it.
- Let's do it.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.967
This dirt is where
the best drilling was.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.567
Now, what we're shooting
for here

11:10.600 --> 11:13.233
is a total of the season
of over 7,500,

11:13.266 --> 11:15.000
we wanna beat
what we did last year.

11:15.033 --> 11:18.100
That's a lot of gold to
get out of this ground
up here in one season.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.467
We've been running Big Red
at a nice pace here

11:23.500 --> 11:24.667
to make all this happen,

11:24.700 --> 11:26.233
but right now,

11:26.266 --> 11:28.533
it's the last lap, we're gonna
crank this baby up.

11:29.934 --> 11:31.700
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.834
If we got any chance
of getting this dirt
through there,

11:34.333 --> 11:35.333
this is it.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.667
Sluicifer in rough shape
right now.

11:50.700 --> 11:51.967
We've run it hard and

11:52.000 --> 11:53.734
run a lot of paydirt
through it this year

11:53.767 --> 11:55.533
and caught a hell of a lot
of gold with it.

11:56.734 --> 11:59.433
Four miles
west of Mud Mountain,

11:59.467 --> 12:02.867
Tyson Lee is piling paydirt
from the Ugly Cut

12:02.900 --> 12:05.533
through Sluicifer
as fast as he can.

12:05.567 --> 12:08.734
We're a little short
from where we were last year,
gold wise.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.600
Hopefully we can get
the rest of this pay
through Sluicifer

12:11.634 --> 12:13.600
before Mother Nature
freezes us down.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.800
Hey, Tyson,
you got a copy, Tyson?

12:25.900 --> 12:27.066
Go ahead,
clear to talk.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.467
There's something wrong
with my loader.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.567
I think the, the tire's burst.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.066
Alec's gonna
come down.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.634
Without
Tatiana clearing tailings,

12:40.667 --> 12:43.500
Tyson will soon be
forced to shut down.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.867
He's go, go, go,
trying to get things fixed.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.166
The pressure is on.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.634
Well, well, well,

12:55.200 --> 12:56.567
looks pretty

12:56.600 --> 12:58.600
A lot of the bedrock
that is in the cut

12:58.634 --> 13:01.100
is very sharp,

13:01.133 --> 13:02.867
jagged.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.266
I wouldn't wanna be
a tire running
on this ground personally.

13:08.133 --> 13:09.133
There we go.

13:10.033 --> 13:11.400
Rims coming apart.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.533
Oh, yeah, great success.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.667
Things are looking good,

13:23.700 --> 13:25.333
just swinging
the new tire in place.

13:26.934 --> 13:27.934
Here we go.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.433
Just reassembled
the other part
of the two piece rim

13:32.467 --> 13:34.300
and now we're about to
throw some air at it.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.033
And see a smile
on Tatiana's face, I'd expect.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.367
- You saved the day.
- Yeah.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.467
- Ooh!
- Well.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.100
- High five for talent.
- Yeah.

13:48.634 --> 13:50.867
I just finally got
my loader back

13:50.900 --> 13:52.734
with a brand-new tire,

13:52.767 --> 13:55.367
can finally get going
with tailings.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.500
I got tons of work
to catch up with.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.767
I'm happy 'cause
there's only so much time.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
Let's get back to work
and finish her off.

14:30.767 --> 14:32.100
Everything around here
is frozen.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.100
The creek's
starting to freeze.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.166
Cold weather
is our biggest enemy.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.133
At California Creek.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.133
Fred Lewis has a few days
left in the season

14:41.166 --> 14:42.567
to hit his goal.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.967
Right now,
we're sitting at 87 ounces.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.667
Last week, we spent
the entire week

14:46.700 --> 14:49.100
fixing problems and we got
zero gold for it.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.133
If we wanna reach our
100 ounce gold,

14:51.166 --> 14:53.734
we can't have any problems
from this point on.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.166
We've got to
fire on all cylinders.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.967
To maximize production,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.767
he's teamed up with neighbor
Brandon Clayton

15:00.800 --> 15:02.367
and his monster trommel.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.367
Purring like a kitten, baby.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.133
Fred's
part of the deal,

15:06.166 --> 15:08.200
keep the dirt devil fed

15:08.233 --> 15:10.066
with a steady flow of paydirt

15:10.100 --> 15:13.300
from his cut
half a mile upstream.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.100
We're gonna do what
we can do to hit that 100.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.433
This is officially
the last push.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.266
Temperatures
are dropping.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.533
and, you know, nature
is definitely knocking at
our front door

15:28.567 --> 15:29.934
saying, "Get the
out of here."

15:32.600 --> 15:34.900
Scout sniper,
Stuart McKenzie,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.166
is in the cut.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.800
Right now, I'm going
through a frozen pay

15:38.834 --> 15:41.734
that is unbelievably thick,

15:41.767 --> 15:43.533
battling rock, battling ice,

15:43.567 --> 15:44.634
battling mud

15:44.667 --> 15:46.400
and run as much pay

15:46.433 --> 15:47.634
through Brandon's plant

15:47.667 --> 15:50.567
that we possibly can
before we get
kicked out of here.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.900
Special Forces
Sergeant Rick Douglas

15:52.934 --> 15:55.066
runs pay to the plant.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.867
We're all just hanging on
by a thread

15:56.900 --> 15:59.700
as far as trying to get
this last big push in

15:59.734 --> 16:01.834
before the cold weather
sends us all home.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.634
I'm trying to keep this thing
running 24/7 right now.

16:09.734 --> 16:10.967
As you can see,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.333
your pay pile is pretty small.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.600
I can probably
make this last one hour.

16:15.634 --> 16:18.100
If they don't pick up
the pace, we're gonna have
a problem here.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.834
I don't wanna have to shut
this plant down.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.133
Hey, guys, what the
is the holdup back there?

16:24.634 --> 16:26.000
Need more pay.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.834
Yes, Stu's really fighting it
over there.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.233
I mean, every place
he's digging is harder

16:30.266 --> 16:32.600
and every place
we're driving now
is soft and muck.

16:33.567 --> 16:34.567
We're trying.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.900
All right, 10-4, man,
time is ticking.

16:39.233 --> 16:40.533
If you would like
to switch jobs,

16:40.567 --> 16:42.333
- I'm more than happy to.
- Yeah.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.066
Whoa! [bleep]!

17:01.200 --> 17:03.100
No!

17:03.133 --> 17:04.333
Get over here!

17:06.800 --> 17:08.500
I'm in the pond.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.166
Somebody better
get over here quick.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.634
It's still sliding down.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.367
I'm in the pond.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.133
It's still sliding down.

17:27.533 --> 17:29.033
And it's filling up
with water.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.433
Hey, Rick,
what happened?

17:39.467 --> 17:42.433
Driving back to get another
load of pay,

17:42.467 --> 17:45.266
and as I'm coming down,
the slope just takes me in.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.600
Even if we wanted to,
we couldn't get
the other rock truck by

17:50.634 --> 17:52.700
to go over and pull pay
on the other side.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.200
Holy man.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.800
We're gonna try and hold it
with the big hole

18:00.834 --> 18:03.166
and the 250 will start
to drag it out.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.734
We don't want that Cat
to roll over

18:04.767 --> 18:06.800
or we're gonna ruin
a half a million dollar machine.

18:09.133 --> 18:12.600
The truck is blocking
the road from the cut.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.000
If they can't rescue it
within the hour,

18:15.033 --> 18:17.166
the plant will run out of pay.

18:18.834 --> 18:19.934
It's in neutral?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.133
It's in neutral.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.500
Okay,
Buzz let's see if it'll...

18:24.533 --> 18:25.533
...come backwards.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.934
Watch your eyeballs, kids.

18:40.867 --> 18:43.467
Right now,
we're unable
to get pay to the plant.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.367
We just can't keep up anymore.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.800
We're shutting the plant off.

18:47.834 --> 18:51.066
Until they salvage
the waterlogged rock truck,

18:51.100 --> 18:53.233
the California Creek operation

18:53.266 --> 18:54.533
is at a standstill.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.233
Well, cable has a lot more
strength than a chain and...

19:01.266 --> 19:02.834
if we're gonna pull her
out of there,

19:02.867 --> 19:04.033
cable's our best bet.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.400
- Clear.
- Clear.

19:18.233 --> 19:20.133
You gotta
be kidding me.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.233
Oh... [bleep], man.

19:28.533 --> 19:32.133
That cable actually hauled
our wash plant up a hill

19:32.166 --> 19:35.066
and it broke here because
there's so much suction

19:35.100 --> 19:37.667
and the silt on the front end
of that truck.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.200
So, we've gotta come up
with another plan.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.333
In my world, we call it
from hell.

19:51.433 --> 19:53.333
I mean, it, it looks
so close right here,

19:53.367 --> 19:54.400
but it just won't come.

19:54.433 --> 19:55.767
- Got an idea, though.
- What's that?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.266
What about using
the old dozer?

19:58.433 --> 20:00.734
Maybe it could probably
pull it back, eh?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.233
Okay. Yeah,
let's do that.

20:02.266 --> 20:04.133
- We'll get this fixed as soon as possible.
- Sounds good.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.233
All good.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.567
Voila!

20:07.600 --> 20:09.934
Oh, they broke the lead
wire that we had,

20:09.967 --> 20:11.567
so we're making the new one.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.500
If this breaks,

20:13.533 --> 20:15.100
that rock truck's
probably staying there.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.266
Fred's last ditch plan,

20:18.300 --> 20:21.000
use the pulling power
of two excavators

20:21.033 --> 20:23.000
plus the D8 dozer.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.266
Looks good.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.266
Okay, everybody pull.

20:33.634 --> 20:34.834
Three...

20:34.867 --> 20:35.900
Two...

20:36.300 --> 20:37.667
One, pull.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.667
Whoo-hoo!

20:51.266 --> 20:52.533
Yeah!

20:53.967 --> 20:55.700
Oh, oh, she's great.

21:03.266 --> 21:06.000
That is a faucet of water
pouring out of the engine.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.767
Everything electrical
was underwater.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.934
I, I believe this one's
done for the season.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.467
Yeah. We've gotta get
this out of the way,

21:13.500 --> 21:15.133
so we can get the road fixed

21:15.166 --> 21:16.467
and get back to
the pulling pay.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.133
Probably lost about
20 grand today

21:20.166 --> 21:21.800
in fuel costs, labor

21:21.834 --> 21:22.934
and lost gold.

21:22.967 --> 21:24.734
Right now, we've got one
rock truck down.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.967
That's a third of our fleet
for hauling pay.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.433
We don't have
a lot of time here.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.433
This one hurt.

22:08.533 --> 22:10.066
At Paradise Hill,

22:10.100 --> 22:11.867
Tony Beets has just days

22:11.900 --> 22:13.000
left in his season

22:13.033 --> 22:15.066
to get the 500 ounces
he needs

22:15.100 --> 22:17.333
to hit his season goal.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.433
He's depending on son, Mike,

22:19.467 --> 22:20.767
with his massive trommel

22:20.800 --> 22:22.333
on the hill...

22:22.367 --> 22:25.634
Trying to get as far in
and grab as much pay
as we can.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.867
...and family friend,
Ruby Mahoney,

22:27.900 --> 22:29.300
running the Kiwi plant

22:29.333 --> 22:30.500
down in the Hunker Cut.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.133
At this point
in the season,

22:34.166 --> 22:36.700
you know, every single
ounce counts.

22:36.734 --> 22:39.000
It's just gonna push
us closer to that,

22:39.033 --> 22:41.567
you know, 4.5 thousand
ounce gold,

22:41.600 --> 22:42.834
all of our hard work

22:42.867 --> 22:45.066
and all the that
we've been through here,

22:45.100 --> 22:46.667
will actually,
count for something.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.600
Everything's looking
all right.

22:49.634 --> 22:52.066
that should be
spinning is spinning.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.767
that should be easy, so.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.533
We're all good.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.834
Hey, Tony. Hey, Tony.

22:58.867 --> 22:59.934
Kiwi plant is running.

22:59.967 --> 23:01.400
Everything is up and going.

23:16.233 --> 23:18.233
It's getting really
close at the end
of the season.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.400
And it could just
be done like that,

23:20.433 --> 23:21.934
but if we get
hit by the snow

23:21.967 --> 23:23.500
and just have to shut down.

23:23.533 --> 23:24.667
So...

23:24.700 --> 23:26.500
hopefully we can keep
at it for as long as we can.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.300
Everything that could
have gone wrong

23:33.333 --> 23:34.734
has gone wrong in this cut.

23:34.767 --> 23:36.166
We've had engine problems.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.000
The cut blew out on us.

23:38.033 --> 23:39.900
Hopefully, we can, you know,

23:39.934 --> 23:41.533
end this season
on a high note.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.867
Kevin, I don't have any water.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.266
What the [bleep]!

24:08.800 --> 24:09.967
Yeah, that ain't
pumping right.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.467
They can't mine
any gold without water.

24:33.967 --> 24:35.100
Oh, yeah.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.500
Only last week,

24:48.533 --> 24:50.700
Kevin cleared mud and debris

24:50.734 --> 24:51.900
from this intake.

24:51.934 --> 24:52.967
Now...

24:53.000 --> 24:54.767
it's blocked again.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.667
I'm really not
surprised at this point.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.166
This cut has been
nothing but problems.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.634
Without water
we can't sluice, and...

25:01.667 --> 25:02.734
we're down again.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.066
This cut is cursed.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.967
I don't know how we're ever
gonna finish this place.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.900
- Hey, Ruby.
- Hey.

25:16.934 --> 25:19.567
So, clearly we're
not gonna get decent
water from over here.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.767
It's gonna get clogged again.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.634
- Right.
- So, we're gonna end up moving the pump.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.266
- Really?
- Since we haven't been down here in a while

25:25.300 --> 25:27.433
where we've been pulling
the pay from has
flooded again.

25:27.467 --> 25:29.433
- Right.
- So, that water is...

25:29.467 --> 25:31.200
as pretty well clear
as we're gonna get.

25:31.233 --> 25:33.634
We won't have
all this...

25:33.667 --> 25:34.800
That's right.
All right. Well,

25:34.834 --> 25:36.533
I guess we're killing
two birds with one stone.

25:36.567 --> 25:38.200
We're gonna empty
your pond, and

25:38.233 --> 25:39.467
at least we have clean water.

25:42.533 --> 25:44.066
Kevin's plan,

25:44.100 --> 25:46.233
move the water intake
for the plant

25:46.266 --> 25:48.500
to the flooded
section of the cut,

25:48.533 --> 25:50.934
which should supply
clean water

25:50.967 --> 25:52.033
free of sediment.

25:54.934 --> 25:56.367
This is exactly
what I expected.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.100
It's all river rock.

25:58.133 --> 26:00.800
So, it's been
pre-washed almost.

26:00.834 --> 26:04.433
We should not have any
sediment issues in here.

26:06.266 --> 26:07.700
It's right there.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.767
Now, next step.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.400
Hook up the suction,

26:12.166 --> 26:13.800
hook up the feed lines

26:13.834 --> 26:15.100
and then...

26:15.133 --> 26:16.834
from the off we go.

26:17.433 --> 26:18.634
Perfect.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.033
Wanna drink?

26:24.800 --> 26:25.934
Clean water.

26:25.967 --> 26:27.000
Step one.

26:34.934 --> 26:36.634
I figured. Yeah,

26:36.667 --> 26:38.066
I heard you coming
like, just

26:43.166 --> 26:44.233
All right.

26:46.233 --> 26:47.200
Yeah.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.667
Oh, nice.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.934
Cool. Let's do it.

26:54.967 --> 26:56.400
Please work,
you piece of junk.

26:56.433 --> 26:57.500
Firing up.

27:04.266 --> 27:05.934
Whoo! Flood's up
and running

27:07.233 --> 27:09.266
We are paying here.
Ready to sluice.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.834
So, hopefully...

27:10.867 --> 27:12.400
That's it. We can just...

27:12.433 --> 27:13.667
finish this off.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.033
Yeah, that looks
a lot better.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.567
I should be able
to just

27:18.600 --> 27:19.967
come back when they need
to clean up.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.800
Excellent.

27:39.634 --> 27:40.834
You know,
this time of year,

27:40.867 --> 27:42.800
the snow can start
flying at any minute.

27:42.834 --> 27:44.266
And that's why
it's so important

27:44.300 --> 27:46.066
to get the Mud Mountain
done here.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.400
Obviously, we had
a big stockpile

27:48.433 --> 27:50.300
of paydirt here
at one point,

27:50.333 --> 27:51.467
and now we've got,

27:51.500 --> 27:52.834
you know, hardly
anything left.

27:53.533 --> 27:54.700
Just got to try and get it

27:54.734 --> 27:56.934
through the wash plant
before everything
freezes up here.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.700
24 weeks ago,

27:59.734 --> 28:01.467
Parker staked his season

28:01.500 --> 28:03.166
on Mud Mountain.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.934
He's dug 60 feet down

28:04.967 --> 28:06.000
to the deepest

28:06.033 --> 28:08.300
and hopefully the best pay

28:08.333 --> 28:09.567
he's ever mined.

28:10.667 --> 28:13.433
So, this is the last few
loads here in Mud Mountain.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.233
Now,
operator Damien Browne

28:17.266 --> 28:19.867
is digging out
the last of the cut,

28:19.900 --> 28:21.467
in the hopes that it delivers

28:21.500 --> 28:24.133
their biggest gold weigh ever.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.033
So, it froze
quite hard last night.

28:26.066 --> 28:28.500
We came out this morning
to find all the water,

28:28.533 --> 28:29.934
is all frozen over.

28:29.967 --> 28:32.000
So it's a good job.
We're getting close
to the end.

28:32.967 --> 28:34.500
I'm really hoping
that these...

28:34.533 --> 28:37.200
coney holes here are gonna
really pay off for us.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.734
I think,
this is actually it.

28:44.033 --> 28:45.033
Nothing, Mitch.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.934
Yeah. Go ahead.

28:49.266 --> 28:50.867
Yeah, man. I think
we're done down here.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.033
No way, man.
That's the last of it, huh?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.767
We've been waiting
a long time to say that.

28:56.634 --> 28:57.834
All right, awesome.

28:57.867 --> 28:59.033
Well, let's just see

28:59.066 --> 29:00.934
if we can get this stuff
through wash plant now.

29:02.266 --> 29:03.233
Better crank it up.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.367
Yeah, buddy.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.100
It has been a long...

29:08.133 --> 29:09.900
season here up Mud Mountain.

29:09.934 --> 29:10.967
I actually can't believe

29:11.000 --> 29:12.967
that, that was
the last scoop out of it.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.033
I just hope there's a bucket
full of gold.

29:23.900 --> 29:25.400
Last bucket
of Mud Mountain

29:25.433 --> 29:27.634
and we've been out here since
Chris got on the ground.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.800
This season hasn't been
what we thought,

29:29.834 --> 29:31.433
it was going to be...

29:31.467 --> 29:34.533
Finally, we can call it
an end after this.

29:34.567 --> 29:36.767
That's it, buddy,
last one right there.

29:38.533 --> 29:41.667
It's about time, I never
thought this nightmare
was gonna end.

29:45.300 --> 29:48.000
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about.

29:49.233 --> 29:51.333
This is such a good feeling.
You think about that stockpile

29:51.367 --> 29:52.734
we had here when we started.

29:52.767 --> 29:55.767
Mud Mountain has been reduced
to one hopper of pay dirt.

29:56.367 --> 29:57.467
We conquered it.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.433
Yeah, nice job, man.

29:59.467 --> 30:01.033
Let's shut this
thing off, man.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.100
Woo! Yeah!

30:05.533 --> 30:08.567
Right now, we're shutting off
Big Red in Mud Mountain
for the last time,

30:08.600 --> 30:09.967
and it's a good feeling.

30:14.767 --> 30:18.266
We won't know until Chris does
a final clean up here for us.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.400
We see just how much gold we
were able to get out of this.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.400
Every year we've...

30:25.433 --> 30:26.533
...been able to climb higher

30:26.567 --> 30:28.834
and higher with our gold
numbers and, you know,

30:29.667 --> 30:31.133
I'm really hoping
this isn't the year

30:31.166 --> 30:32.433
when we don't
beat that record.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.867
This last bit of pay
in the Ugly Cut, and the last
bit of pay

30:36.900 --> 30:38.734
at Mud Mountain can...

30:38.767 --> 30:40.767
...help us get to where
we wanna be,

30:40.800 --> 30:42.634
and that's above 7,500.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.834
Just hours after
Mitch shuts down Big Red,

30:47.867 --> 30:51.066
Tyson is also reaching
the end of the pay dirt

30:51.100 --> 30:52.400
in the Ugly Cut.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.300
So, here we go,
this is the last scoop

30:54.333 --> 30:55.867
of pay going into Sluicifer.

30:57.934 --> 30:59.667
And that's a mining season
wrapped up.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.066
Things are starting
to ice up around here.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.900
Couldn't have stopped
at a better time.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.634
And it's the first day
I've seen stuff like
this on Sluicifer,

31:16.066 --> 31:17.467
and it's a good thing
we're done.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.467
- Hey, Chris, how are you?
- Hey, old dog.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.433
- How are you doing, young fella?
- Good.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.166
- This is it, huh?
- This is it.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.233
- Last one, this is all you're gonna get.
- Yeah.

31:36.266 --> 31:38.233
Claim owner,
Ken Tatlow,

31:38.266 --> 31:40.333
and gold expert,
Chris Doumitt,

31:40.367 --> 31:43.033
arrive for the final
mat pull of the season

31:43.066 --> 31:44.233
on Sluicifer.

31:44.266 --> 31:46.000
Get some of this mud
and dirt out of here

31:46.033 --> 31:47.233
- and see what we got, Ken.
- Yeah.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.266
Yeah, you got some
gold there, Chris.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.467
- Yeah, a little bit in there, huh?
- Yeah.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.266
It is pretty fine,
isn't it?

31:54.300 --> 31:55.500
- It is.
- That looks good,

31:55.533 --> 31:56.900
if you've got enough of it.

32:00.367 --> 32:01.767
- Hey, Ken.
- Hey, Tyson.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
- How are you?
- Good, thank you very much.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.333
- No worries.
- Good job, well done.

32:05.367 --> 32:07.233
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, yeah, good.

32:07.266 --> 32:09.867
I'm glad you were looking
after down here.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.166
It's done.
It's in the bag, so...

32:12.200 --> 32:14.200
Well, the good cut
was all right.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.800
- The bad cut was better than the good cut.
- Yeah.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.300
And the Ugly Cut seemed
to hold to its name.

32:19.333 --> 32:21.166
Now, all we have to do
is watch the movies

32:21.200 --> 32:24.000
- The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:24.033 --> 32:26.033
I guess I'll catch
you at the gold weigh.

32:26.066 --> 32:27.934
- Sounds good. I'll see you there.
- Okay. Yep.

32:27.967 --> 32:28.967
- Take care.
- Thanks, Tyson.

32:38.133 --> 32:39.800
This was final cleanup

32:39.834 --> 32:41.967
for, uh, the Ugly Cut.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.767
That's a final cleanup
for Sluicifer for the season.

32:45.867 --> 32:48.967
The last two clean-ups
weren't all that great,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.934
but with this one,
we're doing the wings also,

32:52.967 --> 32:55.500
which we haven't done
during the whole cut, so...

32:56.433 --> 32:58.033
...that might be...

32:58.066 --> 33:00.700
...the saving grace
for the final cleanup.

33:01.367 --> 33:03.433
Last chance to change its name

33:04.367 --> 33:06.166
from the Ugly Cut to the

33:06.200 --> 33:07.567
not so good-looking cut.

33:16.667 --> 33:18.066
What's happening?

33:18.100 --> 33:21.166
I wanna let you guys
know where we're
at with everything.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.567
Hours after
the sluices stopped,

33:23.600 --> 33:26.834
Parker has some
bad news for his crew.

33:26.867 --> 33:29.467
We're going to come up short
on the gold front

33:29.500 --> 33:32.433
on a season where we've got
a huge amount of bills.

33:35.967 --> 33:37.867
So, what do you wanna
do to try and...

33:38.567 --> 33:39.934
fix the problem?

33:39.967 --> 33:42.934
I think
that we should

33:42.967 --> 33:45.600
try to get something else
opened up.

33:45.634 --> 33:49.834
Still shy of last
year's 7,500 ounce total,

33:49.867 --> 33:52.700
Parker wants to push
for another quick score

33:52.734 --> 33:54.000
before winter hits.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.767
When we finished up
at the Airstrip in zone three,

33:57.800 --> 34:00.333
you know, we did that
addition there

34:00.367 --> 34:01.433
where the road was,

34:01.467 --> 34:03.367
and that was all thawed
underneath there.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.867
That was good ground
too you when you tore up
that road, Mitch.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.567
That showed, that showed
some real potential there.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.266
Earlier
in the season...

34:12.300 --> 34:14.266
Hey, man.
I got the first scoop

34:14.300 --> 34:17.500
of the Airstrip the road
extension piled up here

34:17.533 --> 34:20.100
if you want to start sending
it through that wash plant.

34:20.133 --> 34:23.867
Mitch mined out
ground under a road
at the Airstrip...

34:23.900 --> 34:28.000
Twenty,
keep it going to 281.55.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.367
...and his gamble
paid off.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.800
I'll get down to that
section of road

34:32.834 --> 34:35.300
right along the river there,
move a wash plant down there.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.433
So, we'll start getting
things in place

34:38.467 --> 34:39.800
for the reclamation,

34:39.834 --> 34:41.700
and your crew

34:41.734 --> 34:43.900
can start doing that
kind of stuff, right?

34:43.934 --> 34:45.667
- Yep, for sure.
- Okay.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.233
I think I'll go back
to cleaning gold.

34:47.266 --> 34:48.333
It's a lot easier.

34:48.367 --> 34:49.667
Make sure
the bills are paid.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.300
I tell you what,
I'll get the gold to pay

34:51.333 --> 34:53.700
- for the fuel for the guy who's running the dozer.
- Perfect.

34:53.734 --> 34:55.000
- There we go.
- Thanks, Chris.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.834
The end of the year here,
we're going to need the biggest

35:15.867 --> 35:17.333
gold weigh we've had all year.

35:18.934 --> 35:21.667
A hundred and ninety
feet down in the cut,

35:21.700 --> 35:24.533
Rick's crew are racing
against the clock,

35:24.567 --> 35:26.233
and the deeper they go,

35:26.266 --> 35:27.967
the better the pay gets.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.333
I wish somebody would
turn the heat dial up
to help us out

35:32.367 --> 35:33.867
just to finish
this season off.

35:33.900 --> 35:37.066
You just don't know
what this weather's
gonna do up here.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.867
It might turn
minus-45 overnight.

35:39.900 --> 35:43.100
Wake up one morning
and it's over and we're
not up to our gold.

35:43.133 --> 35:45.000
I mean, I've been trying
to go as hard as I can

35:45.033 --> 35:46.967
all season being
the first year with Rick.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.567
I wanna prove myself.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.500
I want to smash the goal.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.133
We've been giving
off season and

35:57.166 --> 35:59.533
and we're down
to that good pay layer.

36:00.834 --> 36:03.567
Now, it's just basically
come down to

36:03.600 --> 36:06.233
how much we can get pumped
through that wash plant.

36:09.533 --> 36:10.800
Everybody's out here

36:10.834 --> 36:13.233
putting in a 100% effort.

36:13.266 --> 36:16.467
You need to push a lot
of yardage through
here at the end.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.834
We know that the gold's
in the ground here...

36:18.867 --> 36:20.367
but we still have
to run it.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.600
No.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.734
buddy,
that wall's caving in.

36:57.266 --> 36:58.867
[bleep]!

37:00.834 --> 37:02.767
out of the way, man.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.400
damn it.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.100
You better
get the
out of the way, man.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.667
damn it.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.734
Rick, you got a copy,
Rick?

37:21.767 --> 37:23.900
man, inner wall
just caved in on us.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.000
Are you kidding me?

37:26.734 --> 37:27.734
This is not good.

37:28.767 --> 37:30.634
All right, just.
Just stay out of there.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.033
Hang tight,
I'll be right there.

37:34.867 --> 37:36.200
Get the
out of the way.

37:41.533 --> 37:42.533
Let's just take off.

37:52.967 --> 37:55.500
Water, that's formed
a pond on a bench

37:55.533 --> 37:56.734
above the cut

37:56.767 --> 37:59.200
has caused the bank
beneath to collapse.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.600
There are high walls
on all sides.

38:03.634 --> 38:06.634
Any further collapse
could bury the pay,

38:06.667 --> 38:08.967
Rick's equipment, and worse,

38:09.000 --> 38:10.667
any crew operating them.

38:16.634 --> 38:17.967
Get the pump
out of there.

38:19.367 --> 38:21.500
If it gets sketchy,
just leave.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.934
- Get the pump out of there. Leave the way flat.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:23.967 --> 38:24.967
- Okay?
- Good.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.834
Yeah, go quick.

38:29.734 --> 38:31.200
Brennan, Kruse,

38:31.233 --> 38:33.700
and Nathan rushed
to rescue the pump

38:33.734 --> 38:37.200
before the collapsing wall
buries the bottom of the cut.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.600
pissed off.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.300
Better make this fast.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.533
We got all of our
out of there.

38:53.567 --> 38:55.300
But for this year,

38:55.333 --> 38:58.333
you know, we're gonna have
to call it, it's just getting
too, too dangerous.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.934
We've got a stockpile
of pay up at the plant.

39:00.967 --> 39:03.233
Hopefully, with what we've
got up there right now,

39:03.266 --> 39:05.000
it's gonna be all we need
to hit our 2,000 ounces

39:05.033 --> 39:06.834
because this cut right here
is done for the year.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.100
Winter has arrived.

39:31.133 --> 39:33.333
This is hell of a lot more
cold than I was expecting.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.467
I just don't know
how much more we can fight.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.767
We've had a rock truck
stuck in a moat,

39:40.800 --> 39:41.934
that's still down.

39:41.967 --> 39:44.433
So, we're down to
60% of our hauling capacity.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.667
But this is a group
of soldiers.

39:48.467 --> 39:49.734
We aren't quitters.

39:49.767 --> 39:51.066
We aren't gonna slow down.

39:52.266 --> 39:54.000
At California Creek,

39:54.033 --> 39:57.066
the temperature has hit
eight below.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.767
But Fred Lewis and his crew

39:58.800 --> 40:01.000
are still 13 ounces short

40:01.033 --> 40:03.133
of their 100 ounce
season goal.

40:05.133 --> 40:07.066
You've gotta adapt
and overcome.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.367
Winter is gonna make us

40:08.400 --> 40:10.333
do a lot of crazy things
to keep going.

40:20.033 --> 40:21.233
Well, that doesn't look right.

40:22.367 --> 40:24.200
trommel is wobbling.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.467
Hey, Warren,
this is Fred. You copy?

40:28.500 --> 40:30.433
The trommel itself
is wobbling.

40:30.467 --> 40:32.300
It looks like
it's off balance.

40:32.333 --> 40:35.467
Oh, do you have
a look at the guider wheels?

40:35.500 --> 40:37.367
The last wheel on
the end of the trommel

40:37.400 --> 40:39.467
doesn't look like
it's doing the right thing.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.600
If we let that run,

40:40.634 --> 40:43.000
it's gonna put more stress
on the other side,

40:43.033 --> 40:44.700
and we're gonna blow
the other side too.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.200
I'm gonna have to shut
the plant down.

40:59.867 --> 41:01.367
Curl out.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.867
Fred uses the excavator

41:02.900 --> 41:05.000
to remove the broken
guide wheel.

41:10.834 --> 41:11.934
I got it.

41:11.967 --> 41:13.200
Hell,

41:15.667 --> 41:16.667
Hey, I got it.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.467
We're gonna take this cap off

41:20.500 --> 41:22.166
and see what's behind
door number one here.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.433
Oh, can you hear that?

41:25.467 --> 41:26.467
It should be like,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.233
like whisper quiet.

41:31.467 --> 41:33.333
This is a bearing that's...

41:33.367 --> 41:35.800
It's a roller bearing
that's supposed to be
in that cage there

41:35.834 --> 41:38.233
to keep the rest
of the bearing together

41:38.266 --> 41:40.000
and, so...

41:42.233 --> 41:44.433
Yeah, we're just gonna
pound that seal
at the back end,

41:45.100 --> 41:46.100
go look for another one.

41:47.233 --> 41:48.734
We're gonna play
Robin Hood today.

41:48.767 --> 41:49.900
- You know?
- All right.

41:49.934 --> 41:52.433
We're gonna rob
from the good bearings

41:52.467 --> 41:54.133
and give it to
the bad bearings.

41:57.867 --> 42:00.233
You know, when you're
out here in these
secluded environments,

42:00.266 --> 42:01.467
you've gotta use
what you got.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.500
This small bearing

42:05.533 --> 42:08.033
could be the part
that ends their season,

42:08.066 --> 42:09.233
if they can't find

42:09.266 --> 42:10.667
an identical replacement.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.834
You got her,
you busted her.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.133
We want to get
that plant up and goin'

42:18.166 --> 42:20.634
'cause we've got
a pile of pay dirt
around here yet.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.033
So, we don't actually know
if this is the right size here

42:23.066 --> 42:25.233
but we're taking a gamble and,

42:25.266 --> 42:27.734
and hoping that
it's gonna be the one
that we're looking for.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.066
That's it, eh?

42:30.100 --> 42:31.200
This is what
it should look like.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.500
Just like this.

42:33.533 --> 42:35.967
All together, one piece.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.834
Not like that other one
that was in several

42:37.867 --> 42:40.233
and very unhealthy.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.166
So, we'll take
this piece over,

42:42.200 --> 42:43.667
looks like it should be
a pretty close match.

42:50.133 --> 42:52.934
Sheldon's hunch
pays off.

42:52.967 --> 42:54.867
The bearing is a perfect fit.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.767
Yeah, it's pretty tight,
that'll be good.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.200
That's a wrap.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.133
We got
this guide wheel

43:04.166 --> 43:05.667
back together now.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.800
We're gonna get this
welded back up into place

43:07.834 --> 43:09.500
and let's get back
to washing some rocks.

43:12.266 --> 43:14.266
Stick up, stick out. Yeah.

43:21.934 --> 43:22.934
Is that good there?

43:23.367 --> 43:24.367
No, that'll work.

43:29.567 --> 43:32.400
Dirt Devil
is back in business.

43:32.433 --> 43:33.767
And Fred could still

43:33.800 --> 43:35.634
hit his 100 ounce goal.

43:44.734 --> 43:46.166
Trommel's spinnin'.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.834
We're hoping it's gonna
last the rest of the season.

43:48.867 --> 43:51.033
We're stockpiled.
We know we got lots,

43:51.066 --> 43:52.667
very good pay, so, uh...

43:53.867 --> 43:55.433
The Devil's hungry,
let's feed her.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.734
At Paradise Hill,

44:14.767 --> 44:15.934
temperatures have dropped

44:15.967 --> 44:17.867
to ten below freezing

44:17.900 --> 44:19.800
and the snow is falling fast.

44:20.967 --> 44:22.700
Winter has hit.

44:28.700 --> 44:29.734
Call it a day?

44:49.433 --> 44:51.133
So, let's turn
the plant up.

44:51.967 --> 44:53.634
There we go
turning up.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.333
The more we
turn up the feeder,
the more yardage

44:59.367 --> 45:01.000
we're gonna run
through the trommel.

45:01.033 --> 45:02.333
Hopefully that'll help us get

45:02.367 --> 45:04.734
to the season goal
of 4,500 ounces.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.667
Hope

45:08.734 --> 45:10.667
Kevin increases
the feed rate

45:10.700 --> 45:13.066
to finish the last
of the pay pile

45:13.100 --> 45:15.266
before the plant
starts to freeze.

45:18.767 --> 45:21.433
We're trying to get this
all done as soon as possible.

45:21.467 --> 45:23.533
We started the season,
clearing the snow.

45:23.567 --> 45:25.100
Now, we're gonna end
the season running from it.

45:27.200 --> 45:30.667
Winter has officially arrived
here on Paradise Hill.

45:31.867 --> 45:34.900
We've shut
the Kiwi plant down.

45:34.934 --> 45:37.133
Hopefully, we can finish
the season on a high note

45:37.166 --> 45:38.934
and then get the
out of here.

45:40.033 --> 45:43.066
Ruby is sitting
on a pile of pay.

45:43.100 --> 45:45.066
With the plant at full speed,

45:45.100 --> 45:47.834
she should be through it
in two hours.

45:47.867 --> 45:50.200
Hey, Ruby, how is it goin'?

45:50.233 --> 45:52.734
It's going well.
We're pushing through
the last little bit here.

45:54.100 --> 45:55.066
Hell yeah.

46:03.500 --> 46:04.667
Yep, huh.

46:06.166 --> 46:07.200
Yep.

46:08.333 --> 46:09.467
Yep.

46:11.867 --> 46:12.867
Sounds good.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.834
It's bittersweet,
you know, we're at the end
of the season.

46:23.867 --> 46:25.166
We've worked hard

46:25.200 --> 46:27.834
and I hope
our work has paid off.

46:27.867 --> 46:29.634
And this last scoop
will get us

46:29.667 --> 46:32.500
to that 4.5 thousand
ounce gold.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.300
Here we go.

46:38.333 --> 46:39.533
It's been
one hell of a season.

46:43.433 --> 46:45.100
Last bit of pay
through the trommel.

46:45.133 --> 46:47.133
End of the season.

46:47.166 --> 46:48.533
final cleanup.

47:04.634 --> 47:05.634
Hey, Nick.

47:06.266 --> 47:07.467
Huh, it's a nice one.

47:31.367 --> 47:33.967
Oh, you know,
we tore this wash plant apart.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.934
It was beautiful out.

47:35.967 --> 47:38.133
We got it over here
on the new pad,

47:38.166 --> 47:39.834
and we started
putting it together.

47:39.867 --> 47:43.266
And this morning we came out
to a dusting of snow
on everything.

47:44.033 --> 47:45.667
Completely changed overnight.

47:48.467 --> 47:50.133
Temperatures
have plummeted,

47:50.166 --> 47:52.066
but Mitch still has to sluice

47:52.100 --> 47:54.100
Parker's final
pay of the season

47:54.133 --> 47:56.500
from the new cut,
Redemption Road.

47:58.900 --> 47:59.967
We'll see what she does,

48:00.066 --> 48:01.533
but check out those
sluice runs

48:01.567 --> 48:02.667
we're gonna need
to run some water

48:02.700 --> 48:03.900
on them just getting
'em to thaw out.

48:04.967 --> 48:06.433
Ready to go?

48:06.467 --> 48:07.867
Throw some dirt at it.
What do you think?

48:07.900 --> 48:09.333
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's see what happens.

48:10.300 --> 48:11.867
Here we go.
Let's fire this up.

48:12.900 --> 48:13.900
Here we go.

48:19.300 --> 48:20.667
Oh, yeah, there we go.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.233
She's shaking.
Took a little bit

48:22.266 --> 48:23.266
to get her goin'.

48:28.066 --> 48:29.667
Everything's looking
good here, Justin.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.000
Give us some dirt, man.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.100
All right, go time.

48:38.066 --> 48:39.367
Oh-ho-ho, there we go.

48:40.734 --> 48:43.533
Here it is.
We got the first pay dirt

48:43.567 --> 48:46.367
of our winter wonderland
here going through Big Red.

48:47.166 --> 48:48.133
Nice.

48:56.367 --> 48:58.066
So, we're here
on Redemption Road

48:58.100 --> 49:01.000
trying to get as much
pay out of here
as quick as we can,

49:01.033 --> 49:03.233
before it freezes us out.

49:03.266 --> 49:05.800
It's Big Red's last chance
to pay out

49:05.834 --> 49:07.600
before the end of the season.

49:07.634 --> 49:09.066
We're not going home
without a fight.

49:11.033 --> 49:13.800
With the cold
weather, there's lots
of different variables.

49:13.834 --> 49:17.100
And if for any reason
we gotta shut down,

49:17.133 --> 49:18.467
the pipeline could freeze up

49:18.500 --> 49:20.433
and we're gonna have
no water to wash the rocks

49:20.467 --> 49:21.500
and get that gold.

49:21.533 --> 49:23.700
So, we got to do everything
we can possible

49:23.734 --> 49:25.100
to keep the plant
running steady.

49:29.266 --> 49:31.467
Are you having
any major problems?

49:31.500 --> 49:33.734
Depends
what you consider major.

49:33.767 --> 49:35.266
When there's dirt
getting washed...

49:35.300 --> 49:36.834
Right now,
we're doing all right.

49:37.767 --> 49:40.533
If it's minus ten or so,
you've only got,

49:42.033 --> 49:44.367
what, two hours?

49:44.400 --> 49:46.033
If you're broke down
for more than two hours

49:46.066 --> 49:48.133
then the sluice runs
are gonna be frozen solid.

49:48.166 --> 49:49.634
Oh, yeah.

49:49.667 --> 49:51.867
Well, that's what
we're gonna focus on
is just keeping it running.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.066
We got all four trucks
bringing paydirt up.

49:55.634 --> 49:57.767
Hopefully we can get
all the dirt through
before that happens.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.667
All right.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.600
Paydirt's coming out
of the cut right now.

50:02.634 --> 50:04.700
We got lots of material
up here on the deck.

50:04.734 --> 50:07.767
So, all we have to do is just
try and keep Big Red running.

50:18.634 --> 50:21.934
Overnight,
the temperature
at Redemption Road

50:21.967 --> 50:24.467
has dropped to 15 below.

50:26.767 --> 50:30.200
The snow continues to be
falling here on the mine site.

50:31.867 --> 50:34.000
And everything's starting
to get a little packed here.

50:34.033 --> 50:35.266
So, it's getting slick.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.266
You got the trucks
bringing pay up here.

50:37.300 --> 50:39.800
We got to be very careful now.

50:39.834 --> 50:43.700
You look at all the icicles
already starting to form up
here on Big Red.

50:43.734 --> 50:45.266
We shut this wash plant off,

50:45.300 --> 50:46.800
it's not gonna take
much time at all

50:46.834 --> 50:48.467
for everything
to freeze up here.

50:48.500 --> 50:51.066
So, we gotta keep it running.

50:51.100 --> 50:54.800
Yeah, I figured
we're on ice
in this loader, right now.

50:54.834 --> 50:57.767
With these icy conditions
and going up and down
the ramp,

50:57.800 --> 50:59.266
it's definitely dangerous.

50:59.300 --> 51:01.066
So, I just gotta be
definitely on its heels

51:01.100 --> 51:02.800
and paying attention.

51:15.667 --> 51:17.300
Whoa!

51:17.333 --> 51:19.300
Justin, go kill the plant,
go kill the plant.

51:32.834 --> 51:34.667
Right now, we're just gonna
shut down Big Red.

51:35.934 --> 51:37.367
Hopefully, there's nothing
too major

51:37.400 --> 51:38.467
and we're gonna fire back up.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.100
Well, it look like we got
a jam up in the pre-wash,

51:45.133 --> 51:47.000
but we'll take
a quick look here.

51:47.033 --> 51:48.634
What did you do?

51:50.200 --> 51:51.734
At Redemption Road,

51:51.767 --> 51:53.834
a blockage in the pre-wash

51:53.867 --> 51:56.333
has forced the crew
to shut down.

51:56.367 --> 51:58.166
How the did that
get through?

51:58.200 --> 52:00.300
- Big rock in there?
- Oh, yeah.

52:00.333 --> 52:02.033
You want to get that big bar
from the feeder?

52:03.133 --> 52:04.100
We had a close call.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.767
I thought I could break it
in half, like,

52:09.800 --> 52:12.467
some sort of superhero.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.133
- This ain't working, Mitch.
- Lollygagging.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.600
If they can't clear
the pre-wash fast,

52:21.634 --> 52:25.333
the plant will freeze
and their season will be over.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.333
Yeah!

52:29.367 --> 52:31.900
I saw we had material
spilling out in
the pre-wash here,

52:31.934 --> 52:33.567
you can see
all this dirt that's built up

52:33.600 --> 52:35.233
it was sloughing off
the side here.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.266
Watch out.

52:39.333 --> 52:41.700
The risk with any downtime
this time of year

52:41.734 --> 52:43.934
is you only have
a couple of hours to be down

52:43.967 --> 52:45.767
before everything
starts freezing up...

52:46.867 --> 52:48.734
which is just kind of cool,
like, it's kind of fun.

52:48.767 --> 52:50.900
It keeps you,
keeps you on your toes.

52:53.433 --> 52:54.567
An hour in

52:54.600 --> 52:56.834
and the pre-wash
is still blocked.

52:58.533 --> 53:02.367
You know, I think this is one
of the first rock jams
we've had this season

53:02.400 --> 53:04.233
- in the pre-wash.
- It's the first one we've had.

53:04.266 --> 53:05.867
Yeah, so, that's not bad.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.900
Oh, just the boot.
What?

53:09.934 --> 53:11.800
Right, I see
Parker's technique.

53:11.834 --> 53:14.433
But I've never seen
your technique there, Justin.

53:14.467 --> 53:17.000
You know, you see this
foot action here.

53:17.033 --> 53:18.867
Watch Justin, now the toes.

53:21.133 --> 53:22.200
Not bad, eh?

53:23.333 --> 53:24.934
You look like a crab up there,

53:24.967 --> 53:26.233
- just using your toes.
- I know.

53:28.266 --> 53:31.634
- Oh, yeah, there you go.
- Some gold in that stuff.

53:31.667 --> 53:33.266
That's better than what we
saw at Mud Mountain.

53:33.300 --> 53:36.333
We couldn't just
pick up a rock and find
a piece of gold there.

53:37.066 --> 53:38.033
Did you see that?

53:42.100 --> 53:44.333
You know, this ground up here
might not be the best,

53:44.367 --> 53:46.233
but it's been pretty reliable.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.367
- All right, you're all good?
- Yeah.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.667
We just need
this to fire back up.

53:56.700 --> 53:58.634
Big Red lives
to fight another day.

53:58.667 --> 54:01.500
Few rocks, jam, jammed up
ain't going to hurt us.

54:04.200 --> 54:05.333
Whoa!

54:05.834 --> 54:07.500
There it is.

54:07.533 --> 54:09.734
We're very fortunate,
we caught it
as quick as we did.

54:09.767 --> 54:12.200
We got it cleared out,
Big Red's back running.

54:12.233 --> 54:14.734
But if this would have
happened at night,

54:14.767 --> 54:16.533
with the temps like this,

54:16.567 --> 54:18.033
plant would have been down
for a while,

54:18.066 --> 54:19.266
probably wouldn't
got it back going.

54:19.900 --> 54:20.967
We're almost there,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.800
but we still got
a ways to go.

54:23.834 --> 54:25.333
Come on, Big Red.
Hang in there.

54:48.100 --> 54:49.400
That right there...

54:50.867 --> 54:52.400
is ice.

54:52.433 --> 54:56.767
Fred Lewis is still
13 ounces short
of his season goal,

54:56.800 --> 54:58.600
but with his 50-50 split

54:58.634 --> 55:00.834
with Brandon Clayton's crew,

55:00.867 --> 55:02.867
they still need twice that.

55:02.900 --> 55:05.166
We're basically
chasing our thawed pay,

55:05.200 --> 55:06.667
there isn't
much of it left.

55:06.700 --> 55:09.433
That's as far in as I can go.

55:09.467 --> 55:12.333
These pieces of equipment
are getting beat up
by all this frozen ground.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.400
The end is near.

55:23.567 --> 55:25.800
We lit a fire inside
the hopper just to heat it up,

55:25.834 --> 55:28.233
get the frost out of it
so it will spin.

55:28.266 --> 55:30.000
Over at the wash plant,

55:30.033 --> 55:32.667
Brandon's trying to get
the wash plant running

55:32.700 --> 55:34.533
after another freezing night.

55:36.133 --> 55:37.200
See, you can hear that, eh?

55:39.634 --> 55:42.734
That little ice crystals
smashing in there.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.867
Solid as a rock, dude.

55:52.900 --> 55:55.734
Probably 8,000 pounds
of ice in there.

55:56.500 --> 55:59.367
8,000 pounds of solid ice.

55:59.400 --> 56:02.000
We should get
a fire torch on it, but...

56:02.033 --> 56:04.834
...it'll take us
six-seven hours
to thaw this thing out.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.834
When this eight inch
waterline freezes solid,

56:09.934 --> 56:12.333
then it's way too cold
and we need to get back home.

56:13.567 --> 56:14.667
Freddy, you got a copy?

56:15.533 --> 56:16.967
This is Fred.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.600
Hey, Fred,
we need you down here
as soon as possible.

56:19.634 --> 56:21.066
We got an issue down here.

56:21.100 --> 56:22.500
Roger that.
I'll be right there.

56:25.200 --> 56:27.934
- What's going on?
- My eight inch water line froze.

56:29.066 --> 56:30.533
That froze solid.

56:31.600 --> 56:32.767
Oh, that's not good.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.667
It looks pretty frozen.

56:34.700 --> 56:38.200
When eight inch water line
freezes, it's game over.

56:38.233 --> 56:40.367
So, so, what do you,
what do you want to do?

56:40.400 --> 56:42.166
- I'm not seeing any way we could keep going.
- Right.

56:42.200 --> 56:44.033
I think, we were lucky
to be here this long.

56:45.367 --> 56:48.300
I think you're right.
It's just time to pack up,
go home.

56:48.333 --> 56:50.834
- Yeah.
- Take what we got in our box, and...

56:50.867 --> 56:52.033
All right,
I'm gonna call the guys

56:52.066 --> 56:53.567
and we'll get those
mats pulled.

56:53.600 --> 56:54.767
- and...
- 10-4.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.533
- Get everything out of here. Good job, bro.
- Fred.

56:56.567 --> 56:58.533
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Yup, later.

56:58.567 --> 57:01.333
Hey, Misfits, I wanna
have you guys meet up at camp.

57:01.367 --> 57:03.800
We're gonna have a meeting.
Everybody, Lottie dottie.

57:11.233 --> 57:13.600
What's up? What is up?

57:13.634 --> 57:15.400
- Ah, there you go.
- Howdie, howdie.

57:15.433 --> 57:16.634
- Hey...
- What's up, man?

57:16.667 --> 57:18.934
All right,
so I talked to Brandon.

57:18.967 --> 57:20.500
His... his pipes are freezing.

57:20.533 --> 57:22.533
His water pump
has very little left.

57:22.567 --> 57:23.967
If it gets any colder
than it is.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.800
It's supposed to snow
a foot tonight.

57:25.834 --> 57:27.467
There is no pay left,
right now

57:27.500 --> 57:29.734
that's economically viable
to pull.

57:29.767 --> 57:32.033
Basically, what I'm saying is
we're done.

57:33.934 --> 57:35.634
This season's been,
you know, first of all man,

57:35.667 --> 57:37.467
I don't think that
there's anybody who could say

57:37.500 --> 57:39.000
that we did not put...

57:39.033 --> 57:40.600
- the time in.
- Yeah.

57:40.634 --> 57:42.767
When's the last time you
had to put that much

57:42.800 --> 57:45.967
focus and energy
into one flippin' task?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.367
- One goal, one objective.
- 2009.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.100
Fighting the Taliban
in Afghanistan.

57:50.533 --> 57:52.100
Yep. 2009, 2010.

57:52.133 --> 57:54.233
I was thinking the other day
when we were talking
about therapy,

57:54.266 --> 57:56.233
I was just like, "Yeah,
I used to work so
damn hard

57:56.266 --> 57:58.400
You can't even think about,
where all your
problems are."

57:59.367 --> 58:00.934
Dude, cognitive reboot, man.

58:00.967 --> 58:02.000
Yeah.

58:02.033 --> 58:04.367
Fred's crew
of military veterans

58:04.400 --> 58:08.066
still needs to clean
all the concentrate
they've produced

58:08.100 --> 58:11.667
to find out if they've hit
their 100 ounce season goal.

58:12.634 --> 58:14.834
Got to pull mats,
all full mat pull.

58:14.867 --> 58:16.300
We'll do that today.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.066
We get our final go away

58:18.100 --> 58:19.934
and we go home.

58:19.967 --> 58:21.467
- You guys good with that?
- Yeah, cool.

58:22.066 --> 58:23.667
- Misfits.
- Misfits.

58:44.133 --> 58:46.200
It's always got to be
so close, man.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.166
Rick's
Rally Valley mission

58:49.200 --> 58:52.400
to double his gold haul
to 2,000 ounces

58:52.433 --> 58:53.867
is in the balance

58:53.900 --> 58:57.400
as the Yukon winter
slams the door on his season.

59:01.133 --> 59:04.500
We, uh, did everything
we could, man.

59:04.533 --> 59:06.667
Frozen sluices aren't doing us
any favors, right now.

59:06.700 --> 59:09.400
I don't think we could go on
any longer this year,
even if we had more dirt.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.500
Well, it's the last scoop.

59:13.033 --> 59:14.900
Time to shut her down.

59:14.934 --> 59:17.166
If it wasn't in the pay pile,
there's nothing
we can do this year.

59:18.567 --> 59:19.934
All right, boys,
that's the last one.

59:19.967 --> 59:21.567
Let's, uh, shut her down
and see what we got.

59:33.734 --> 59:35.734
Well, I see
some gold in here, eh.

59:35.767 --> 59:37.533
- Hey. Yeah.
- There's some gold in here...

59:37.567 --> 59:38.700
That other one looked good.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.767
When you see
runs like this,

59:41.800 --> 59:43.700
it's usually time to get
the out of here

59:43.734 --> 59:45.867
and go home for the winter.

59:45.900 --> 59:48.100
Well, this is the last cleanup
of the season, minus ten...

59:48.133 --> 59:49.700
That's cold,
do you know what I mean?

59:49.734 --> 59:51.533
We usually try and get done
and get out of here,

59:51.567 --> 59:54.300
but the weather's set in,
a lot earlier this year.

59:54.333 --> 59:57.166
So, hopefully, this will take
us to our 2000 ounce of goal

59:57.200 --> 59:58.900
and that's what
matters, right?

59:58.934 --> 1:00:02.533
Rick's crew dug
190 feet down to pay dirt

1:00:02.567 --> 1:00:05.033
that should be
three times as rich

1:00:05.066 --> 1:00:07.300
as the pay he normally runs.

1:00:07.333 --> 1:00:09.400
It doesn't look
too bad, but I hate guessing

1:00:09.433 --> 1:00:12.166
and you're never gonna
know until you run
it across the scales.

1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:13.467
Hopefully, it's all
in the box, man.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.634
That's all we got
for this year.

1:00:31.233 --> 1:00:33.200
Well, here we are.
We finally made it.

1:00:33.233 --> 1:00:34.567
This is the last scoop

1:00:35.333 --> 1:00:37.433
heading towards the Harper

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:40.166
and this road cut
is gonna be finished.

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:43.467
At the airstrip,

1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:46.367
Mitch taps out
Redemption Road.

1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:49.834
Yeah, buddy, go ahead
and throw her in there.

1:00:49.867 --> 1:00:52.266
That's the last one.
How's that feel?

1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:54.133
Oh, I don't know.
After Mother Nature

1:00:54.166 --> 1:00:55.500
and everything else
against us,

1:00:55.533 --> 1:00:56.934
I wasn't sure
we were gonna get here.

1:00:56.967 --> 1:00:58.033
It feels pretty good.

1:01:01.934 --> 1:01:03.934
Whoo!

1:01:03.967 --> 1:01:05.600
- How does it feel?
- There it is.

1:01:05.634 --> 1:01:07.233
Whoo! We're done.

1:01:07.266 --> 1:01:08.467
That's it.

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:11.767
- Shut her down, pack up--
- Shut her down, boys. Yeah.

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.033
Good work, Justin.

1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:16.900
Yeah.

1:01:20.634 --> 1:01:22.200
It's definitely been
a struggle here,

1:01:22.233 --> 1:01:24.266
but we got Chris down
ready to do the cleanup.

1:01:24.300 --> 1:01:26.100
And it's time
to call it a season.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.500
Worst part is, I got
to wash his mats

1:01:29.533 --> 1:01:30.734
with my bare hands.

1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:35.734
- Little frosty this morning.
- Little bit.

1:01:37.300 --> 1:01:39.567
It was a good call digging up
this road, Mitch.

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:41.367
It really was. I think,

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.900
if you get a good
clean-up here,

1:01:43.934 --> 1:01:45.734
it could put us over the top

1:01:45.767 --> 1:01:47.333
from last year.

1:01:47.367 --> 1:01:49.033
When you look back,
we've done a lot of cuts.

1:01:49.066 --> 1:01:50.600
We did zones one and two

1:01:51.367 --> 1:01:52.700
at the airstrip.

1:01:52.734 --> 1:01:55.967
Then we did zone three,
we did the road extension
in zone three.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.033
Then we sent Sluicifer down,

1:01:58.066 --> 1:01:59.634
did the good,
the bad, the ugly.

1:01:59.667 --> 1:02:02.133
We took Big Red up,
did Mud Mountain,

1:02:02.166 --> 1:02:04.000
now, we brought it back down
here and did the road.

1:02:04.033 --> 1:02:06.333
- Nine cuts.
- Whole bunch, man.

1:02:06.634 --> 1:02:08.200
It is.

1:02:08.233 --> 1:02:10.300
It's all the thawed dirt
we have right here.

1:02:10.333 --> 1:02:11.900
So, if it's in there,
it's in there.

1:02:11.934 --> 1:02:13.634
If it's not,
we gave it a hell of a try.

1:02:15.634 --> 1:02:17.000
To beat last season's

1:02:17.033 --> 1:02:19.367
7,500 ounce gold total,

1:02:19.834 --> 1:02:21.166
they still need

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:23.634
over 350 ounces.

1:02:23.667 --> 1:02:25.266
You know,
we're really close.

1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:27.333
We've been gaining
on last season's numbers

1:02:27.367 --> 1:02:28.567
little by little, but...

1:02:29.634 --> 1:02:32.000
just not enough
to have a season breaker.

1:02:32.033 --> 1:02:33.266
But...

1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:34.867
you never know
what this ground holds.

1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:36.433
As he worked
towards the river,

1:02:36.467 --> 1:02:38.667
it got better and better.

1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:40.700
And the roads
right alongside the river.

1:02:40.734 --> 1:02:41.934
So,

1:02:41.967 --> 1:02:43.400
this should be

1:02:43.433 --> 1:02:44.900
a good final cleanup.

1:02:46.567 --> 1:02:49.166
All right, well, we're gonna
start breaking things down,

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:50.533
start winterizing stuff,

1:02:50.567 --> 1:02:52.634
- and, uh, we'll see down at the gold weigh room.
- Okay.

1:02:52.667 --> 1:02:54.433
Sounds like a plan.
We'll be out of here

1:02:54.467 --> 1:02:56.100
- in just a couple minutes.
- Thanks.

1:02:57.300 --> 1:02:59.000
Another season over, eh,

1:02:59.033 --> 1:03:00.300
hard to believe.

1:03:01.266 --> 1:03:03.066
Whoo! Chris.

1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:05.400
Final cleanup.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.333
- Final cleanup.
- Final cleanup.

1:03:10.100 --> 1:03:11.667
Been watching
the geese fly by,

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:13.734
thinking, you know,
that they're going
in the same direction

1:03:13.767 --> 1:03:14.767
I wanna go.

1:03:16.033 --> 1:03:17.800
High-fives, ladies.

1:03:17.834 --> 1:03:19.000
Well done.

1:03:19.934 --> 1:03:21.634
- Real terrific.
- We did it, we did it.

1:03:21.667 --> 1:03:22.667
We did it.

1:03:25.567 --> 1:03:27.634
As you can see,
it's getting really cold out.

1:03:27.667 --> 1:03:29.333
I mean, the timing
was impeccable.

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.033
We're about

1:03:31.066 --> 1:03:33.166
a 360 ounces short

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:34.333
from the last year.

1:03:35.266 --> 1:03:36.834
It's gonna be close.

1:03:36.867 --> 1:03:38.367
It is, it's gonna be

1:03:38.934 --> 1:03:40.533
very, very, close.

1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:54.800
- Hola.
- Hi, guys.

1:03:55.166 --> 1:03:56.333
Hola.

1:03:56.367 --> 1:03:58.934
After six hard months
of mining,

1:03:58.967 --> 1:04:00.667
the Beets family gathers

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:03.166
for their final gold weigh
of the season...

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:05.200
I know it's a lot, isn't it?
It's more than you.

1:04:06.200 --> 1:04:07.300
...to find out

1:04:07.333 --> 1:04:10.133
if they've hit
their 4,500 ounce goal.

1:04:11.433 --> 1:04:12.900
Thing is
this is our last week,

1:04:12.934 --> 1:04:15.467
we're all shut down now.
How'd the last week go?

1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.467
We did do some sluicing,

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:23.200
so I hope we have something
in one of those jars.

1:04:23.233 --> 1:04:24.700
Just hope that we have
something to show

1:04:24.734 --> 1:04:26.767
for all the headache
that we were down there for.

1:04:30.667 --> 1:04:32.600
It's snowing, I could see
Santa Claus waving

1:04:32.634 --> 1:04:34.233
as he was driving by--

1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:38.600
Yeah.

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.033
- Say hello to my little friend.
- What? No way!

1:04:44.467 --> 1:04:47.266
That, I don't think we've ever
gotten that much off of Kiwi.

1:04:48.300 --> 1:04:49.467
Is that a season total?

1:04:50.934 --> 1:04:52.734
Okay, everybody ready?

1:04:52.767 --> 1:04:53.900
Let's do this thing,
chicken wing.

1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:56.800
Twenty, thirty,

1:04:57.367 --> 1:04:59.300
forty, eighty,

1:04:59.333 --> 1:05:00.400
ninety,

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:01.967
hundred,

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:03.867
one hundred and forty,
one hundred and fifty,

1:05:05.867 --> 1:05:09.066
158.34. Yee!

1:05:10.233 --> 1:05:13.266
That's super awesome.
I did not expect that at all.

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.433
Neither did I.

1:05:14.467 --> 1:05:18.333
Worth $285,000,

1:05:18.367 --> 1:05:20.033
battling the cursed cut

1:05:20.066 --> 1:05:21.800
has finally delivered.

1:05:21.834 --> 1:05:24.700
So now, that I've contributed
a little something

1:05:24.734 --> 1:05:27.133
to, uh, the end of the year
gold weigh,

1:05:27.166 --> 1:05:30.300
how much more do we need
to get to that 4,500?

1:05:30.333 --> 1:05:32.533
Another 354 ounces.

1:05:32.567 --> 1:05:33.834
I hope it's in those jars.

1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.433
They look, they look,
pretty promising.

1:05:39.934 --> 1:05:41.233
Three, two, one, go.

1:05:44.233 --> 1:05:45.567
Ten,

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:47.433
20, 30, 40, 50,

1:05:47.867 --> 1:05:49.734
110, 120, 130,

1:05:50.300 --> 1:05:51.533
200, 210,

1:05:52.133 --> 1:05:53.800
220, 300,

1:05:53.834 --> 1:05:56.233
310, 20,

1:05:56.266 --> 1:05:58.934
- 30, 340, 350, 360,
- Well, you hit your goal.

1:05:58.967 --> 1:06:01.533
...370, 380, 390,

1:06:02.433 --> 1:06:03.433
400.

1:06:09.834 --> 1:06:12.367
410, 420, 430, 450,

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.433
460,

1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:18.467
463.94.

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.200
Both cuts,
bringing in a total

1:06:21.233 --> 1:06:24.734
of 1.1 million dollars.

1:06:24.767 --> 1:06:26.467
That's our biggest gold weigh
this far.

1:06:28.634 --> 1:06:30.300
And the season total
for this year

1:06:30.333 --> 1:06:33.433
is 4,620.9 ounces.

1:06:33.467 --> 1:06:36.800
Okay, that means
we're over by 120.9 ounces.

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.400
The Beets
have mined well over
eight million dollars

1:06:44.433 --> 1:06:47.033
and beaten their goal
for Paradise Hill.

1:06:56.700 --> 1:06:58.200
I would just like
to say that this year

1:06:58.233 --> 1:07:00.734
has been pretty great
seeing as you have
a granddaughter.

1:07:00.767 --> 1:07:03.400
That's the best thing
about this year.

1:07:03.433 --> 1:07:05.100
You know, it is...

1:07:05.133 --> 1:07:07.000
- That's priceless.
- Far more precious

1:07:07.033 --> 1:07:09.166
from all that metal
you have on the table.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:15.000
Yeah.

1:07:15.033 --> 1:07:17.367
You guys
all done a good job.

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:19.634
And I guess we have
to get ready for winter.

1:07:19.667 --> 1:07:22.400
So, you guys wanna get
on that so we can all leave?

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:27.233
- She's the boss.
- She is the boss.

1:07:27.266 --> 1:07:29.300
- She is the boss.
- Whatever makes you feel better.

1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:39.066
- We'll see you in Holland.
- Yes.

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:42.433
- Give me a hug.
- I love you. I love you.

1:07:42.467 --> 1:07:43.900
Bye, okay.

1:07:43.934 --> 1:07:44.934
See you in The Netherlands.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.400
Yeah, that turned out
pretty good.

1:07:50.433 --> 1:07:51.734
I have to say so myself.

1:08:00.166 --> 1:08:01.567
And we got another grandchild.

1:08:02.367 --> 1:08:03.667
So, life is pretty good.

1:08:06.300 --> 1:08:07.300
Yeah.

1:08:24.867 --> 1:08:26.066
- Yeah.
- There you go.

1:08:27.967 --> 1:08:29.600
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's up?

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:34.467
- Let's see.
- That sounded heavy.

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:36.200
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, guys.

1:08:36.233 --> 1:08:37.233
It's the last one.

1:08:38.333 --> 1:08:39.567
I'm a little nervous
about this one.

1:08:40.233 --> 1:08:42.000
We had a tough week.

1:08:42.033 --> 1:08:43.667
At the start
of the season,

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:46.867
Fred struggled
to find ground to mine.

1:08:46.900 --> 1:08:49.700
He didn't start sluicing
until over two months

1:08:49.734 --> 1:08:51.200
into the five month season.

1:08:52.233 --> 1:08:54.300
Now, he's going to find out

1:08:54.333 --> 1:08:56.734
if he has made
it as a Yukon miner

1:08:56.767 --> 1:08:59.367
and hit his 100 ounce goal.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:02.266
Regardless of what
this is, though,
I'm proud of you, guys.

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.433
Right now, we're sitting
at 87 ounces.

1:09:04.467 --> 1:09:06.100
Remember, we give
half of it away.

1:09:06.133 --> 1:09:08.233
So, we need 26 ounces

1:09:08.266 --> 1:09:10.066
- to hit 100.
- All right.

1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:11.867
The crew needs
13 ounces

1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:13.266
to hit their goal.

1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:15.066
But, half of the final gold

1:09:15.100 --> 1:09:18.066
belongs to Fred's partner,
Brandon Clayton.

1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:20.100
Kind of delaying
the inevitable here, guys.

1:09:20.133 --> 1:09:21.567
How about you start pouring?

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:23.200
Oh, I've never been
this nervous.

1:09:24.634 --> 1:09:26.567
Twenty-six, come on.

1:09:29.367 --> 1:09:33.767
One, two, four, five,
six, seven, eight, ten,

1:09:34.433 --> 1:09:37.867
eleven, fifteen, seventeen,

1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:40.200
Twenty.

1:09:40.233 --> 1:09:42.233
Twenty one, twenty two,
twenty three...

1:09:42.266 --> 1:09:44.700
...twenty four,
twenty five, twenty six...

1:09:44.734 --> 1:09:46.867
twenty seven, twenty eight,
twenty nine, thirty...

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:48.600
Oh, look at this.

1:09:48.634 --> 1:09:49.800
- ...thirty eight...
- Oh, come on.

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:52.066
...thirty nine...

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:54.667
Come on.

1:09:54.700 --> 1:09:57.200
...forty two, forty three,
forty four...

1:09:57.233 --> 1:10:00.233
45.585.

1:10:01.100 --> 1:10:02.500
Whoo!

1:10:02.533 --> 1:10:05.500
- Oh, my God!
- That's a weight.

1:10:05.533 --> 1:10:09.567
We get half of that,
so we get 22.8 ounces.

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.700
Nearly twice what
they needed.

1:10:13.433 --> 1:10:15.066
- Good.
- We did it.

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:17.767
- Not only did we do it, we beat it.
- I can't believe it.

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.400
We came here under

1:10:19.433 --> 1:10:22.433
- impossible frickin' odds, late in the season...
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:22.467 --> 1:10:24.066
- ...found ground...
- Yeah.

1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:25.934
...and we pulled
over 110 ounces.

1:10:25.967 --> 1:10:29.433
Worth almost $200,000,

1:10:29.467 --> 1:10:32.967
over 15 times what they
produced last year.

1:10:34.300 --> 1:10:36.200
I'm proud to be
part of this team.

1:10:36.233 --> 1:10:39.900
You come here to the Yukon,
green as

1:10:41.834 --> 1:10:43.967
Now, I don't care
what anybody says.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.133
- You guys are
- Right on.

1:10:46.166 --> 1:10:47.634
- Thank you.
- You guys are.

1:10:47.667 --> 1:10:48.734
Thank you.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.734
We appreciate you.

1:10:53.767 --> 1:10:55.734
- Thanks--
- This was not given to any of us.

1:10:55.767 --> 1:10:57.100
Nobody was handed
anything here.

1:10:57.133 --> 1:11:00.133
We earned with blood,
sweat and some tears.

1:11:00.166 --> 1:11:01.700
- Mm-hmm.
- This was a fight, man.

1:11:01.734 --> 1:11:03.967
- This was a fight and I don't think...
- Yeah, the whole time.

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.800
...I would have had
it any other way.

1:11:05.834 --> 1:11:08.967
Thank you for being
part of this team because
now we're all family.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.900
I needed this,
this helped me focus,

1:11:11.934 --> 1:11:13.767
and you guys stuck with me,

1:11:15.066 --> 1:11:17.767
and I said, "[bleep],
I'm all in for the win, man."

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:19.800
'Cause when
people telling you,

1:11:19.834 --> 1:11:22.200
you couldn't do it,
it's like, "No."

1:11:22.233 --> 1:11:24.200
You bring in a bunch
of green berets,

1:11:24.233 --> 1:11:26.567
- we're gonna make it happen.
- Mm-hmm.

1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:29.033
All of us can say
we've gold mined
in the frickin' Yukon.

1:11:29.066 --> 1:11:31.734
It's like legendary epic

1:11:31.767 --> 1:11:34.400
You talk about obstacles
we've all overcome
them in our lives,

1:11:34.433 --> 1:11:36.533
this is probably, for me,

1:11:36.567 --> 1:11:38.900
one of my biggest
achievements ever.

1:11:38.934 --> 1:11:41.367
Let's pack our
and get outta here,
let's go see our families.

1:11:45.233 --> 1:11:47.700
I'd call this
an A-team, gold mining A-Team.

1:11:47.734 --> 1:11:50.567
You're surrounded by guys,
you trust them with your life

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:52.467
and it feels like that
with these guys here.

1:11:53.433 --> 1:11:54.533
Kudos to Fred,

1:11:54.567 --> 1:11:56.367
he had a number of hurdles
that he had to clear,

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:58.066
you know, to make this happen.

1:11:58.100 --> 1:11:59.767
He's a great leader
and he's a great guy.

1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:01.567
I can't wait to start
it up for next year.

1:12:02.867 --> 1:12:05.233
I started this company
to help veterans

1:12:05.266 --> 1:12:07.500
to give some people purposes
that needed a purpose.

1:12:07.533 --> 1:12:09.233
And right now,
we've done that.

1:12:09.266 --> 1:12:11.100
Every single person
that came up here

1:12:11.133 --> 1:12:12.300
has a purpose now.

1:12:12.333 --> 1:12:15.300
And now,
I couldn't feel any more
proud of my team.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:16.734
I just can't wait
to kick more ass.

1:12:26.934 --> 1:12:27.967
How are you doing,
buddy?

1:12:28.634 --> 1:12:29.934
Two days ago,

1:12:29.967 --> 1:12:33.467
Kruse was rushed
to the hospital with
stomach pains.

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:36.367
I've got, uh, diverticulitis,

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:40.200
it's an infection
in my intestine and colon.

1:12:40.233 --> 1:12:43.800
We've all busted our
asses all season long
and come up short.

1:12:43.834 --> 1:12:45.300
Literally,
gut-wrenching.

1:12:45.333 --> 1:12:47.567
Just feel helpless laying here
in a hospital room.

1:12:49.634 --> 1:12:51.200
Well yeah,
I mean it's [bleep],

1:12:51.233 --> 1:12:52.767
bummer that you're
sitting in the hospital,

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:55.667
but that's probably
exactly where you need
to be right now.

1:12:55.700 --> 1:12:57.567
There's one
gold weigh left,

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:58.800
that's the big one, so...

1:12:59.700 --> 1:13:00.800
keep me posted.

1:13:00.834 --> 1:13:02.367
It's gonna be close, man.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.667
They're cleaning it up now,
we'll know, and as soon as
I know, you'll know.

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:06.767
- All right, man.
- All right, buddy, take care.

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:07.800
You too, man.

1:13:23.767 --> 1:13:25.333
Oh, for sure.

1:13:25.367 --> 1:13:27.634
Man, this weather's beautiful,
we should start
sluicing again.

1:13:27.667 --> 1:13:28.834
I think so.

1:13:28.867 --> 1:13:30.934
Not everybody
has made it

1:13:30.967 --> 1:13:33.634
to Rick's final gold weigh
of the season.

1:13:33.667 --> 1:13:35.600
How's old Kruse boy doing?

1:13:35.634 --> 1:13:38.200
He's in the hospital,
he's got diverticulitis

1:13:38.233 --> 1:13:41.333
and possible perforation.

1:13:41.367 --> 1:13:43.934
He is in some pain,
but you know, he'll recover.

1:13:43.967 --> 1:13:45.500
At the start
of the season,

1:13:45.533 --> 1:13:48.367
Rick shocked everyone
by doubling his gold

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.166
to 2,000 ounces.

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:51.967
To achieve the impossible,

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.233
he moved over
a million yards of dirt

1:13:54.266 --> 1:13:56.066
from a cut over three times

1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:59.400
as deep as any
he's mined before.

1:13:59.433 --> 1:14:03.000
And he did it all with
a bare-bones crew.

1:14:03.033 --> 1:14:04.800
Well, man, it's been quite
the season, eh.

1:14:06.433 --> 1:14:09.500
I couldn't be more happy
to be a part of my
first year here,

1:14:09.533 --> 1:14:12.500
and look at what we
conquered as a team,
man, it's crazy.

1:14:12.533 --> 1:14:14.934
Kind of nice to be that
small family feel again

1:14:14.967 --> 1:14:17.667
- just get back to the roots of mining.
- Yeah.

1:14:17.700 --> 1:14:19.066
We're small team, right?

1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:20.767
But we do,
we're doing big things.

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:23.567
You look at what
we did this year, like,
you leave for home with...

1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:26.634
- your head high, you know what I mean, like?
- Yeah.

1:14:26.667 --> 1:14:27.834
This deep ground's
where it's at.

1:14:27.867 --> 1:14:29.900
I've never gotten
anywhere close to that deep.

1:14:29.934 --> 1:14:31.433
- Oh!
- None of us here had.

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:33.600
- No.
- And that wall to collapse,

1:14:33.634 --> 1:14:34.934
it sucks that happened but,

1:14:34.967 --> 1:14:38.266
I, I think there's huge
potential in this channel,

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:40.667
and I'm looking forward
to mapping out

1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:42.567
where it goes and
chase

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:43.867
Yeah.

1:14:43.900 --> 1:14:47.700
We were at
just over 1,650
from the last gold weigh,

1:14:47.734 --> 1:14:52.600
we're just shy of 350 ounces
to hit 2,000.

1:14:52.634 --> 1:14:55.567
And it's gonna be
really close,
I'm not going to lie.

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:57.834
This, this is 250 ounces
right here.

1:14:57.867 --> 1:15:01.266
- Holy
- Right here, and I don't know what's in here,

1:15:01.300 --> 1:15:04.100
as I want to do it
with you guys, so...

1:15:04.133 --> 1:15:07.500
There's 250 in there,
we need like 96 ounces.

1:15:07.533 --> 1:15:09.533
To hit his season goal,

1:15:09.567 --> 1:15:11.934
Rick needs the biggest
gold weigh

1:15:11.967 --> 1:15:13.200
he's ever had.

1:15:14.667 --> 1:15:16.233
Man,
this is gonna be close.
It's absurd.

1:15:18.133 --> 1:15:21.467
We've got ten, 20,

1:15:22.066 --> 1:15:25.066
30, 40, 50, 60,

1:15:25.667 --> 1:15:27.567
70, 80...

1:15:29.033 --> 1:15:31.834
...still going, 90, 100.

1:15:31.867 --> 1:15:34.000
- Shut the up.
- 100 and...

1:15:34.033 --> 1:15:36.734
- 103.47.
- No way.

1:15:36.767 --> 1:15:38.033
yeah.

1:15:39.934 --> 1:15:41.233
I got
something else though,

1:15:41.266 --> 1:15:42.900
we didn't get to the bottom
of that cut,

1:15:42.934 --> 1:15:44.700
but we got close,
we got some nuggets.

1:15:44.734 --> 1:15:47.266
- No way. Wow.
- Nice.

1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:49.333
So, yeah.

1:15:49.367 --> 1:15:50.500
Well, this would be
a big

1:15:50.533 --> 1:15:52.567
- in the Indian River, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:55.166
See what it is.
Oh, that's a good sound.

1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:56.567
That is.

1:15:57.467 --> 1:15:58.600
Yeah, there we go,
that's another

1:15:58.634 --> 1:16:00.200
- 27 ounces, boys.
- Yeah.

1:16:00.233 --> 1:16:02.233
- Awesome.
- Got one more little jar here.

1:16:03.433 --> 1:16:04.467
This will sound really good.

1:16:05.367 --> 1:16:07.200
- No!
- Wow!

1:16:09.934 --> 1:16:13.066
That's another
13.5 ounces.

1:16:13.100 --> 1:16:14.533
Doesn't that look cool though?
Look at that.

1:16:15.634 --> 1:16:17.200
Oh, man.

1:16:17.233 --> 1:16:19.900
That is by far
our biggest gold total
for a week.

1:16:19.934 --> 1:16:22.433
Uh, It's almost
400 ounces, 393.

1:16:22.967 --> 1:16:25.834
That's 2,047 ounces.

1:16:25.867 --> 1:16:27.934
That's awesome, man.

1:16:27.967 --> 1:16:29.767
After gambling everything,

1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:32.033
on hitting
a gold rich pay layer

1:16:32.066 --> 1:16:34.500
at the bottom
of the Rally Valley,

1:16:34.533 --> 1:16:36.800
it's finally paid off,

1:16:36.834 --> 1:16:40.367
delivering $700,000
worth of gold

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:42.000
in the last week.

1:16:42.033 --> 1:16:44.533
and taking his
season gold haul

1:16:44.567 --> 1:16:47.967
to almost $3.7 million.

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:50.867
- I love you, man.
- Love you too, dad.

1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:52.934
- Good job.
- And it's awesome that you're here for this.

1:16:52.967 --> 1:16:54.634
- Appreciate it.
- This is a big step.

1:16:56.900 --> 1:16:59.500
- That represents victory right there.
- Yeah.

1:16:59.533 --> 1:17:02.233
The goal we needed was
at the bottom of Rally Valley

1:17:02.266 --> 1:17:04.200
we all went after it
and we got it.

1:17:04.233 --> 1:17:07.200
The amount of people
that we had and to pull off
what we pulled off,

1:17:07.233 --> 1:17:09.300
I'm gonna have
a nice little jar of gold
for all you guys, so...

1:17:11.634 --> 1:17:13.033
What about that?

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:16.166
Check's in the mail, dad.

1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:18.700
I'm trying to think back
what you used to pay me
when I was growing up.

1:17:20.567 --> 1:17:22.900
- Was paying you a kick in the ass.
- There it is.

1:17:22.934 --> 1:17:25.967
That's, that's what it was,
it was a kick in the ass,
there it is.

1:17:27.967 --> 1:17:32.300
- All right, let's get out of the snow
- Time to go home, boys.

1:17:32.333 --> 1:17:34.867
Is it nice to go
home knowing that
we hit 2000 ounces?

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:37.400
I don't know how to top it.

1:17:37.433 --> 1:17:40.834
I mean, I will,
I'll top it next year, but...

1:17:40.867 --> 1:17:44.000
there's more
than a lifetime
of mining here and...

1:17:44.033 --> 1:17:46.033
I'd put the down payment
to secure it.

1:17:46.066 --> 1:17:48.634
That's a hell of a good
feeling 'cause by the end
of next year,

1:17:48.667 --> 1:17:49.834
I got no royalties to pay.

1:17:50.834 --> 1:17:51.867
Unbelievable.

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:54.734
Rick has entered
the major leagues,

1:17:54.767 --> 1:17:56.734
doubled his gold total,

1:17:56.767 --> 1:17:58.533
bought his own ground

1:17:58.567 --> 1:18:02.000
and produced his
best season ever.

1:18:02.033 --> 1:18:04.533
To say that
I'm proud right now
is an understatement.

1:18:04.567 --> 1:18:06.000
Man, it's a,
it's a good feeling.

1:18:19.967 --> 1:18:22.934
Final gold weigh
for the season.

1:18:22.967 --> 1:18:26.300
Traditionally, we get
a campfire going and get
the whole crew down here.

1:18:27.533 --> 1:18:30.000
Let them see the fruits
of their labors.

1:18:30.033 --> 1:18:31.867
All the gold we're gonna get,
we got.

1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:34.533
After starting this
season on the back foot,

1:18:34.567 --> 1:18:37.500
facing competition
for Klondike ground,

1:18:37.533 --> 1:18:40.700
and struggling to mine
the deepest cut of his career,

1:18:40.734 --> 1:18:43.567
It's time for Parker's
final gold weigh.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:47.433
Parker, Parker, Parker.

1:18:50.667 --> 1:18:53.433
What? Does that make sense?

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:56.533
Thank you all for coming
to this little pow-wow,

1:18:56.567 --> 1:18:58.433
our final gold weigh.

1:18:58.467 --> 1:19:00.100
It is your
guys' work that

1:19:00.133 --> 1:19:01.767
got us through the season.

1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.100
You know,
this season started out,

1:19:03.133 --> 1:19:05.033
I was a little bit nervous.

1:19:05.066 --> 1:19:07.333
We lost Superman Shane

1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:09.266
and Brennan,

1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:11.400
and it was a little bit
of a concern for me,

1:19:11.433 --> 1:19:14.033
but, um, you guys all rose
to the challenges.

1:19:14.066 --> 1:19:15.066
And thank you.

1:19:16.233 --> 1:19:17.667
Do you wanna throw
some gold on the scale?

1:19:17.700 --> 1:19:19.367
So, we've got...

1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:20.767
...Sluicifer
that was running down

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:22.000
on Ken and Stuart's ground,

1:19:22.033 --> 1:19:23.934
- and Joan, of course.
- Yeah.

1:19:23.967 --> 1:19:25.500
I hate to pick on you,
old timer,

1:19:25.533 --> 1:19:26.900
but I know we get excited

1:19:26.934 --> 1:19:28.066
when we find a tusk.

1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:29.734
What it must
have been like,

1:19:29.767 --> 1:19:31.967
when you found, like,
the whole animal walking?

1:19:35.333 --> 1:19:37.166
No, Chris,

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:39.200
- I'm old, but I'm not that damn old.
- I'm gonna get my...

1:19:39.233 --> 1:19:40.500
abuse when you leave,

1:19:40.533 --> 1:19:42.800
so you just sit back
and take it.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.333
So, Ken, this is...
your Ugly Cut.

1:19:47.367 --> 1:19:49.467
And this is from like
half a week.

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:52.533
To hit his biggest
season total ever,

1:19:52.567 --> 1:19:55.667
Parker needs 7,500 ounces,

1:19:55.700 --> 1:19:58.667
but he's over
350 ounces short.

1:20:01.266 --> 1:20:02.533
Sixty ounces.

1:20:02.567 --> 1:20:04.133
Ken, for your
ground this year,

1:20:04.166 --> 1:20:07.900
the good, the bad
the ugly is 2,076 ounces.

1:20:07.934 --> 1:20:09.400
- That's good.
- That's good.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.834
Yeah, that's not bad.

1:20:11.867 --> 1:20:13.767
Ken's ground this year

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.200
has delivered
over 3.5 million dollars.

1:20:17.233 --> 1:20:19.867
Ken, thank you for helping
getting that strip down there.

1:20:19.900 --> 1:20:21.433
And thank you

1:20:21.467 --> 1:20:23.600
for just being here
all season,

1:20:23.634 --> 1:20:24.767
like nobody has...

1:20:26.333 --> 1:20:28.800
...nobody has a landlord
that comes and, like...

1:20:29.834 --> 1:20:30.834
does all the work.

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:34.667
- You guys left nothing for us.
- Yes.

1:20:36.100 --> 1:20:38.033
This is the end of all
the Airstrip Cuts.

1:20:38.066 --> 1:20:39.900
This is where Big Red
just finished up.

1:20:39.934 --> 1:20:41.433
Let's see
what we got here, Doumitt.

1:20:45.133 --> 1:20:47.100
Fifty, hundred,

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:48.934
- and we're still going.
- Wow!

1:20:48.967 --> 1:20:50.900
- Keep it going, keep it going.
- Yeah!

1:20:53.467 --> 1:20:55.200
299.6.

1:20:55.233 --> 1:20:57.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:01.467
So all in all, we got 3,000

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:03.600
- combined with both wash plants.
- Yes.

1:21:03.634 --> 1:21:05.000
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yeah, it's...

1:21:05.033 --> 1:21:07.200
Yeah, you guys answered
the challenge, man.

1:21:08.333 --> 1:21:10.266
The bonus 300 ounces

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.000
from Redemption Road

1:21:12.033 --> 1:21:13.734
puts the season total

1:21:13.767 --> 1:21:16.567
at 7,501.

1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:19.000
So here's
Mud Mountain.

1:21:20.266 --> 1:21:21.700
What do you got?
What do you got?

1:21:25.533 --> 1:21:28.133
This is 350 ounces,
right there.

1:21:28.667 --> 1:21:29.967
And in this one...

1:21:32.934 --> 1:21:35.066
is another 350 ounces.

1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:36.100
Yeah.

1:21:37.867 --> 1:21:39.867
We need 3,000 ounces

1:21:39.900 --> 1:21:41.867
to break even at Mud Mountain,

1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:44.100
we're at 2,950 ounces,

1:21:44.133 --> 1:21:45.400
we're 50 ounces short.

1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:47.166
But...

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:48.533
we have one more thermos.

1:21:50.667 --> 1:21:52.734
It's a one-hander,
it's not that heavy.

1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:55.767
- It's 80...
- It's gotta be 100.

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:57.100
- ...100 and...
- Got it.

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.967
108.45.

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.967
So, for Mud Mountain, we got

1:22:03.567 --> 1:22:06.000
3,058 ounces.

1:22:06.033 --> 1:22:08.900
Far less than
the drill tests indicated

1:22:08.934 --> 1:22:11.200
and barely enough
to cover the costs.

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:13.233
Parker. Hey, man,

1:22:13.266 --> 1:22:16.834
you almost made
100 grand on the deal, almost.

1:22:16.867 --> 1:22:18.900
- Well, all that worry, all that wear and tear...
- No, I mean.

1:22:18.934 --> 1:22:20.900
It's not... It's just
like the sad part

1:22:20.934 --> 1:22:22.533
- is how much effort went into it.
- Yeah.

1:22:22.567 --> 1:22:24.634
Like, 'cause, like,
you guys busted your balls

1:22:24.667 --> 1:22:26.834
- to make that work.
- Oh, we pulled it through.

1:22:26.867 --> 1:22:28.066
- I know.
- Yeah.

1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:29.767
- They won't.
- Neither will you.

1:22:29.800 --> 1:22:31.767
I'll throw some
fun facts at ya.

1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:35.800
Last year we had 7,504 ounces,

1:22:35.834 --> 1:22:38.033
this year, we have

1:22:38.834 --> 1:22:42.266
8,309.75 ounces.

1:22:44.867 --> 1:22:46.200
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

1:22:47.767 --> 1:22:51.166
We beat last year
by 800 ounces, you guys.

1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:55.033
Despite Mud Mountain
not living up to its promise,

1:22:55.066 --> 1:22:59.400
Parker's mined over
a million dollars
more than ever before,

1:22:59.433 --> 1:23:01.600
grossing a record-breaking

1:23:01.634 --> 1:23:03.934
fifteen million dollars

1:23:03.967 --> 1:23:05.567
in Klondike gold.

1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:08.367
I wouldn't want to have
had any different crew.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:11.233
Like, really enjoyed
working with you guys.

1:23:11.266 --> 1:23:12.800
You all had, even you, Justin

1:23:12.834 --> 1:23:14.367
and then losing
the fuel caps...

1:23:15.033 --> 1:23:16.533
Yes, even you.

1:23:17.834 --> 1:23:19.767
But, like, we had
some really good

1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:21.734
greenhorns this year.

1:23:21.767 --> 1:23:23.834
And, and I hope
that we can do it again.

1:23:25.834 --> 1:23:27.400
Team, Parker, yeah.

1:23:29.767 --> 1:23:30.900
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.834
- Yeah.
- I'll drink to that.
