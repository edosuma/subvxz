00:05.088 --> 00:07.257
Welcome to Maximum Mudroom Makeover,

00:07.341 --> 00:09.635
and, boy,
do we have a treat for you today.

00:09.718 --> 00:13.013
You're doggone right, Anna.
We're here with Charles Peterson,

00:13.096 --> 00:15.599
a young man who,
along with his sister, Lizzie,

00:15.682 --> 00:19.853
put his dream of getting a puppy on hold
in order to foster countless others.

00:19.937 --> 00:23.857
It's true, Campbell.
Lizzie and I love dogs more than anything.

00:23.941 --> 00:27.945
And that's why we're gonna help
as many dogs as we can find forever homes.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.697
After hearing this heartwarming story,

00:30.781 --> 00:34.368
the Maximum Mudroom Makeover team
knew we had to help.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.496
Here's what Charles and Lizzie's mudroom
used to look like.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.376
Charles, are you excited
to see your new puppy paradise?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.794
So excited, Anna.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.341
This is so, so cool.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.385
You and the puppies deserve it.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.512
I can't wait to show--

00:54.596 --> 00:57.057
Lizzie, why are you wearing a blindfold?

00:57.140 --> 01:00.978
It's an experiment for school.
Well, not technically for school.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.022
More for me to gain perspective,
for school.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.692
I'm doing a report on Helen Keller,

01:06.775 --> 01:09.444
so I'm trying to experience
what it's like to be blind.

01:09.528 --> 01:14.116
Okay. Remember how we were talking about
fixing up the mudroom for the puppies?

01:14.199 --> 01:16.743
-I was thinking--
-Can you record me eating dinner?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.371
-I wanna document it for extra credit.
-Can't.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.415
Sammy's grandma is picking me up in--

01:21.915 --> 01:23.292
-Now.
-Wait.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.629
Again?
You and Sammy are always hanging out.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.674
It's what happens
when you have a best friend, I guess.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.260
I guess.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.773
Honey, are you sure we can't do anything?
Helen Keller had a helper, you know.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.984
You mean Anne Sullivan.
She wasn't a helper.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.320
She was Helen Keller's teacher
and best friend.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.698
She encouraged her to do things on her own
and to be self-sufficient.

01:55.866 --> 01:56.867
It's open.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.119
-Who's that?
-Surprise dinner guests.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.246
You might wanna take off your blindfold.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.583
Helen Keller wasn't able
to see her guests.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.169
-Hello, Petersons. Hi.
-Hi.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.213
Is that Dr. Abby?

02:09.795 --> 02:11.548
The accent. It always gives me away.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.384
You brought a puppy.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.845
I never show up to a dinner party
empty-handed.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.514
This little quokka is Shadow.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.058
His new owners had no idea
their son was allergic,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.310
so they've asked me
to find him a new home.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.937
Shadow, that is, not the son.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.399
-Charles and I will find him one.
-Your dad might have beaten you to it.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.818
Captain Carter wants to surprise
her daughter Nell

02:31.902 --> 02:35.030
with a puppy for her seventh birthday.
Shadow was perfect.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.574
Lizzie, you have to see
how adorable he is.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.202
That's okay.
I can experience Shadow in other ways.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.997
Did you know that when you lose one
of your senses, the others are enhanced?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.418
He has the sweetest puppy breath.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.546
Shadow's staying with us
until Nell's birthday party.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.464
-Yes!
-Which reminds me,

02:52.548 --> 02:56.051
what happened to Charles's plan
to make the mudroom more puppy friendly?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.345
It's hard when he's always
at Sammy's house.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.473
Shadow's a well-behaved fellow
and quite happy in his crate.

03:01.557 --> 03:02.850
He won't be a problem.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.394
Here we are, Lizzie.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.148
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.278
Looks like he couldn't wait either.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.117
-Hey, buddy.
-Hi. Oh, hello.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.871
Since I wasn't able to see,

03:23.954 --> 03:27.791
my other senses, like hearing,
taste and smell, all got a lot stronger.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.003
That really made me appreciate
the strength of Helen Keller,

03:31.086 --> 03:32.796
who used the resources she did have

03:32.880 --> 03:35.007
to show the world
that she wasn't handicapped,

03:35.090 --> 03:36.967
but she was handicapable.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.889
Thank you, Lizzie. Excellent job.

03:41.972 --> 03:42.973
Actually...

03:48.437 --> 03:50.022
Homemade cupcakes, one dollar.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.317
Homemade secret recipe cupcakes,
two for a dollar.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.076
Yes!

04:04.077 --> 04:07.748
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria!

04:15.297 --> 04:17.591
Other senses don't get stronger
when you're blind.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.052
You just learn
to pay more attention to them.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.263
Also, maybe Helen Keller would have liked
being called handicapable,

04:23.347 --> 04:25.140
but maybe she wouldn't.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.560
To me, it feels like you're saying
having a disability is a bad thing,

04:28.644 --> 04:30.020
and I don't think it is.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.272
It's just part of who some people are.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.817
Wow, Maria, that is incredibly insightful.

04:35.901 --> 04:39.363
Thank you for teaching us,
myself included,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.448
something really important today.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.498
The bones are good,
so let's focus on theme.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.584
Modern, minimalist,
maybe rustic farmhouse?

04:52.668 --> 04:54.878
I just want it safe for the puppies.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.506
Have you noticed that
Shadow won't stop staring at us?

04:57.589 --> 04:59.383
I don't think he's blinked once.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.053
Lizzie says he's the most focused puppy
she's ever seen.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.430
Or maybe he just thinks
you're dressed funny.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.475
Yeah.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.019
Whoa! Be careful.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.147
Lift from your legs.
Keep your core tight and your eyes up.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.276
-Maybe I should find someone to help me.
-Yeah. Good idea.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.195
Oh, right.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.788
Shadow, move. I almost stepped on you.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.416
Guess he's not as smart as we thought.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.799
No, he's smarter. Shadow saw
you were gonna step on those nails.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.217
He was protecting you.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.053
They could have
gone right through my rubber soles.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.306
I knew I should have worn work boots.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.516
You are a special puppy, aren't you?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.445
-Can I say hello?
-Of course. His name is Simba.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.156
Hi, Simba.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.495
I-- I'm sorry.
I didn't realize he was a guide dog.

06:10.579 --> 06:14.082
Don't be sorry. Simba's modest.
He doesn't like to brag about it.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.837
He's beautiful.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.757
And he's more than just a handsome face.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.342
The Helping Eyes Foundation

06:23.425 --> 06:27.012
said that he was the most impressive puppy
they've ever trained.

06:27.095 --> 06:31.350
Simba's been my eyes for eight years now,
and I don't know what I'd do without him.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.645
I'm sure Helen Keller would have
loved to have a dog like Simba.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.272
My niece said the same thing last night.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.816
Her class just finished reading
The Story of My Life.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.986
-That's my class. Who's your niece?
-Hey, Aunt Camila.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.114
Look, my mom's here.
Well, no, you don't have to look.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.327
It was nice meeting you. Bye, Simba.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.094
Sleeping.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.141
Lizzie, come on. I'm tired.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.687
From what, cleaning the mudroom?
'Cause it looks exactly the same.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.357
We have to get everything ready
before we can start the major work.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.278
Sammy says the most important part
of renovation is preparation.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.656
Charles, not everything always
has to be about Sammy, you know?

07:27.739 --> 07:31.451
Why don't you like Sammy?
Did he do something to you?

07:33.745 --> 07:36.123
No. Sammy's great.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.042
And I'm glad you have a best friend.
It's just...

07:43.630 --> 07:44.631
I don't know.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.561
Lizzie, he did the most amazing th--

07:59.855 --> 08:00.856
What?

08:00.939 --> 08:03.734
It has to do with Sammy.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.320
Go ahead.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.780
Sammy was about to step
on a bunch of rusty nails,

08:08.864 --> 08:11.325
but Shadow ran in front of him
and barked like crazy.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
-Really?
-He knew, Lizzie.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.873
-He's like...
-The most impressive puppy ever?

08:17.956 --> 08:19.041
Totally.

08:19.833 --> 08:24.296
Kiddos, bad news. The captain's daughter
has decided she wants to be a magician

08:24.379 --> 08:25.380
when she grows up.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.342
Instead of a birthday puppy,
she's getting a vanishing cabinet.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.929
We need to find another home for Shadow.
Let's talk about it tomorrow. Cool?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.054
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.392
That's not bad news. That's great news.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.187
It's a sign that Shadow's meant
for something bigger,

08:40.270 --> 08:43.106
-something more than being a pet.
-Like what?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.691
Like becoming a guide dog.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.612
-Do you think he could?
-It's worth finding out.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.247
Excuse me?

09:00.082 --> 09:02.668
I'm Lizzie Peterson.
This is my brother, Charles.

09:02.751 --> 09:03.752
Hi.

09:04.962 --> 09:09.758
And we have the most impressive puppy
you'll ever meet in your entire life.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.302
We were wondering if you could consider

09:12.386 --> 09:15.097
making him a part of
your guide dog training program.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.017
He's calm. He's really smart.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.937
And he has natural ability
to sense when something's wrong.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.816
He's such a good puppy.
He wants to take care of people.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.900
Please?

09:26.984 --> 09:29.945
First of all,
if you wanna get on my good side,

09:30.028 --> 09:36.076
the two precious minutes between 4:30 and
4:32 are hardly the best time to do so.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.204
That is reserved for hot cocoa
and baked goodies.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.956
-No exceptions.
-But--

09:41.039 --> 09:43.584
Secondly, we have rules.

09:43.667 --> 09:48.922
And one of those rules is we do not allow
outside dogs into our training program.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.842
All of our recruits are bred by us.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.386
But Shadow could be
the best guide dog ever.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.514
Yeah, and some rules
were made to be broken.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.850
And these rules were made
by our president.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.603
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:02.686 --> 10:06.356
the remastered, original,
London cast recording

10:06.440 --> 10:10.611
of Phantom of the Opera is about to drop,
and I have been waiting on that for...

10:11.361 --> 10:12.988
well, my entire life.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.034
-We'd like to speak to the president.
-You just did.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.501
So now what? Instead of
doing great things for humanity,

10:25.584 --> 10:27.544
Shadow's just gonna be a regular dog?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.755
I mean, unless Simon changes his mind.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.799
-The whole thing's not fair.
-It's more than not fair.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.801
Shadow's rights are being denied.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.804
We need a grassroots campaign
to get him a tryout.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.556
I can start a petition

10:39.640 --> 10:43.143
explaining how Shadow saved me
from stepping on a bunch of rusty nails.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.979
Do you know how much that would have hurt?

10:46.063 --> 10:47.981
Just thinking about it makes me dizzy.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.113
I'll catch you guys later.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.157
Thanks, Maria.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.326
Maria, hi.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.828
Hi, Lizzie.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.414
I met your aunt yesterday.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.458
Yeah, I saw that.

11:07.709 --> 11:11.547
Look, I feel really dumb for telling
the class what it's like to be blind

11:11.630 --> 11:12.965
while you were right there.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.425
You shouldn't.
Your report was really good.

11:15.509 --> 11:20.848
And if it makes you feel any better,
you make me feel dumb sometimes too.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.686
Really? Cool.
Wait, how do I make you feel dumb?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.646
-I mean, you're Maria.
-What do you mean?

11:27.729 --> 11:30.023
Just that you're incredibly good
at everything.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.695
I'm serious. Why are you laughing?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.614
Remember the second-grade spelling bee?

11:38.407 --> 11:39.408
Invincible.

11:39.908 --> 11:44.329
I-N-V-I-N-C-I-B-L-E.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.414
Invincible.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.714
Or last year's production of Hamilton?

12:18.947 --> 12:21.241
Well, you're the captain
of the debate team.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.702
I won't rebut that point.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.498
I think this is the longest conversation
we've had since first grade.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.708
Definitely.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.211
If you wouldn't mind,

12:32.294 --> 12:34.505
-I'd like to ask your advice on something.
-Sure.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.216
My brother and I,
we're fostering this dog, Shadow.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.761
He's amazing, and I think
he'd make a great guide dog, like Simba.

12:40.844 --> 12:41.887
The only problem is--

12:41.970 --> 12:44.681
The Helping Eyes Foundation
will only train their own dogs.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.226
Yeah, how-- how did you know that?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.102
Oh, right. You're Maria.

12:49.186 --> 12:53.232
Other puppies should be given a chance.
I can't imagine my aunt without Simba.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.943
And there could be someone
who Shadow would be perfect for.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.194
Exactly.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.657
I've been around Simba my whole life,
so I do know a lot about guide dogs.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.158
If you want, I can meet Shadow.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.078
Maybe between our two brains,
we could figure something out.

13:06.161 --> 13:09.206
Really?
Well, you wanna come over after school?

13:09.289 --> 13:13.544
Okay. But I can't stay long.
I have a test tomorrow in honors history.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.797
That's fine. I have one in honors math.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.303
What do you think, Shadow?

13:23.387 --> 13:27.724
It's like a massive pile of leaves
to play in, but inside.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.061
Shadow?

13:33.355 --> 13:34.356
Shadow?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.610
There you are.

13:43.699 --> 13:44.950
I can't wait to meet him.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.077
We're only taking care of him temporarily.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.039
Charles?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.042
Lizzie.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.420
Check this out.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.715
Come on, Shadow.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.426
Puppy on the bottom.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.724
Kid on top.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.228
Sammy's Grandma Dayle made it.
She's an amazing carpenter.

14:13.312 --> 14:14.313
Cool.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.279
Okay. I love him.

14:24.656 --> 14:28.619
We're gonna take Shadow upstairs.
Maria is an expert on guide dogs.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.204
Well, I'm not an expert.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.749
But I do know some tests we can do
to see if Shadow's a good candidate.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.417
-Do you wanna help?
-Definitely.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.589
Not.
Thanks for asking, but you two go.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.258
Come on, Shadow.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.011
Thanks.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.769
You were right about Shadow.
He's calm and doesn't get distracted.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.855
But he's also curious.
He'd make a great guide dog.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.108
Honestly,
it's not Shadow I'm worried about.

15:00.192 --> 15:03.654
-It's Simon, the foundation's president.
-What do you know about him?

15:05.197 --> 15:07.199
Only that he has a major attitude,

15:07.282 --> 15:10.369
a sweet tooth, and he's a pretty big fan
of musical theater.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.371
I know we can figure this out.

15:12.454 --> 15:17.084
Like you said in your Helen Keller report,
we need to use whatever resources we have.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.919
Wait, we?

15:19.503 --> 15:20.754
Well, yeah.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.799
-I wanna help.
-Okay. Resources.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.301
Online encyclopedias can be
pretty unreliable,

15:26.385 --> 15:29.096
so we have to cross-check
our primary source data.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.432
Actually, I was thinking
of something more like...

15:33.934 --> 15:35.853
the drama club wardrobe department.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.648
How is that gonna help Shadow
become a guide dog?

15:54.621 --> 15:55.831
Fear not.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.543
A delicious cupcake, good sir?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.295
Why do you look familiar?

16:01.378 --> 16:02.880
I'm Alexander Hamilton.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.216
You probably know me from founding
the United States financial system.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.302
Please, have a colonial confection.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.513
And I'm Eliza.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.974
I started the first orphanage
in New York City.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.935
And you are here because...

16:17.019 --> 16:20.272
We're revolutionaries,
and we think it's important to...

16:21.064 --> 16:22.399
break the rules.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.528
-Now I remember you.
-As you know,

16:26.612 --> 16:29.990
guide dogs possess special qualities
to do their jobs effectively.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.825
That's why we put together five tests

16:31.909 --> 16:34.328
to show you what an amazing guide dog
Shadow can be.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.287
We call it...

16:36.496 --> 16:37.915
the trust test.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.917
You may wanna sit down for this.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.634
Test number one, touch.

16:48.717 --> 16:52.179
This shows how comfortable
the puppy is with human contact.

16:52.763 --> 16:56.767
-You'll notice he's very calm.
-Very, very calm.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.479
Our next test...

17:01.855 --> 17:02.856
Eliza?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.277
Guide dogs have to learn to handle
all kinds of sounds and noises.

17:07.361 --> 17:10.364
As you can see, Shadow's fine with it!

17:10.446 --> 17:13.534
Yes, but I'm not! Turn that off.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.744
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.455
The umbrella test.

17:20.582 --> 17:24.502
Pop it open and see how
the puppy reacts to being startled.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.590
The tunnel.

17:28.674 --> 17:32.636
The puppy runs through,
displaying his confidence.

17:32.719 --> 17:38.267
And finally, we see how responsive
a distracted puppy is when called.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.647
Shadow? Return.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.492
So, what do you think?

17:58.245 --> 17:59.580
Not bad.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.583
Although I prefer buttercream to ganache.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.752
-Noted. But we meant--
-The puppy.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.715
I can't say
that he doesn't have potential.

18:09.798 --> 18:14.094
And your presentation was excellent.
I admire your moxie.

18:14.178 --> 18:18.307
But as I previously told Mr. Hamilton
in no uncertain terms,

18:18.390 --> 18:22.227
I can't break the rules. I'm sorry.
Good day.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.605
-You're the president!
-I said good day.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.115
Hey, Lizzie.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.452
I was thinking of asking Ms. Newman
to let us switch partners

18:38.535 --> 18:42.122
so that you and I can work together
on the Industrial Revolution project.

18:42.206 --> 18:45.125
-If you want.
-Sure, yeah. I'd love that.

18:45.751 --> 18:50.047
-We just have to convince Ms. Newman.
-I bet we can if we use our best resource.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.715
The cupcake cart?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.593
Each other.
The two of us working together?

18:54.676 --> 18:58.764
I think we'll be
pretty I-N-V-I-N-C-I-B-L-E.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.475
-Invincible.
-That was cringey.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.976
So cringey.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.313
My dad found Shadow a new home.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.857
Do you wanna come over later
to say goodbye?

19:08.941 --> 19:12.444
I wish. I have a paper due
on plate tectonics for honors science.

19:12.528 --> 19:16.782
Right. I have to study too.
J'ai un quiz in honors French.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.453
You're really good at science.
Can I call you if I have questions?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.623
Yeah. And if I have--

19:25.832 --> 19:27.251
I got you, my friend.

19:30.546 --> 19:34.591
Seriously, I don't know
if this is a better dog room or kid room.

19:34.675 --> 19:38.053
Gotta hand it to you two.
This room looks fantastic.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.931
And almost everything in here
is either upcycled or recycled,

19:41.014 --> 19:43.141
which means it's eco-friendly
and sustainable.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.060
Or, as Dad likes to say...

19:45.143 --> 19:46.270
Free.

19:48.689 --> 19:52.234
Oh, good. I'm not too late.
Sammy, your grandma's waiting for you.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.944
-Lates.
-'Kay.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.783
I know it's not exactly what we wanted,

19:59.867 --> 20:02.369
but as long as
they give Shadow lots of love,

20:02.452 --> 20:04.204
I'm sure he'll be really happy.

20:04.288 --> 20:07.791
I know. I just wonder if there was
anything else Maria and I could've done

20:07.875 --> 20:10.294
-to convince Simon.
-I'm sure you guys were awesome.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.505
Kids, this is Traci and her son, Wyatt.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.299
Hey, what's up?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.342
-Hi.
-They're Shadow's new family.

20:17.426 --> 20:21.263
True, but Shadow's real job
will be to help Wyatt get around.

20:21.346 --> 20:25.309
I don't think Shadow's allowed to be
a guide dog.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.144
-He's not.
-Simon?

20:27.227 --> 20:30.314
But Wyatt's not old enough
to have a guide dog of his own yet.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.108
And until he is,
I can't think of a better companion

20:33.192 --> 20:35.903
or someone to keep an eye on him
than Shadow.

20:40.824 --> 20:41.867
Hi.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.286
He likes me already.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.167
Well, what happens
when it is time to get a guide dog?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.504
-What happens to Shadow then?
-Well, nothing.

20:53.587 --> 20:56.423
Guide dogs and regular dogs
live together all the time.

20:56.507 --> 20:59.676
And I'm sure Shadow will be thrilled
to have a new dog best friend.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.679
Dad, can we take Shadow outside to play?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.183
Definitely.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.185
-Come on. I'll show you.
-Great.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.690
This is kind of amazing.

21:13.774 --> 21:16.902
Well, Shadow's kind of amazing himself.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.906
Thank you.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.410
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I should join my family.

21:25.494 --> 21:28.372
I don't want Shadow to like them
more than he likes me.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.562
We need to celebrate.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.438
Like this.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.943
Try it. It's so fun.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.237
Lizzie, Maria's on the phone.

22:01.864 --> 22:03.574
Tell her I'll call her right back.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.078
It's on.
