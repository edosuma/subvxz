WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
The following programme contains
strong language.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.080
We found traces of blood
in Room 7 of Keaton Hall.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.680
Is it Neve's blood?
No comment.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.000
It's about your ex-wife.
What did you think had happened,
when Victoria went missing?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.560
It's about your ex-wife.
What did you think had happened,
when Victoria went missing?

00:19.600 --> 00:22.640
She walked out on us.
She struggled...being a mum.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.000
What did she say?
Nothing important.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.600
What did she say?
Nothing important.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.520
Where did you stay?
Tom's.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.800
'I need you to be straight with me
cos I've been here before.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.000
I can't see the kids
go through that again.'

00:32.000 --> 00:32.320
I can't see the kids
go through that again.'

00:32.360 --> 00:35.560
'Something's happening, Dad.
I've started disappearing.'

00:35.600 --> 00:37.680
What will happen if you bury me?

00:40.640 --> 00:44.160
The GHB's screwed up my memory.
I don't think it's the drugs.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.760
Maybe you were right -
about facing what's happened.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.000
'How could you
just let him go?'

00:48.000 --> 00:48.560
'How could you
just let him go?'

00:48.600 --> 00:51.560
CPS didn't feel there was
a strong enough case to charge.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.640
What about forensics?
What about the belt?!

00:53.680 --> 00:56.000
What belt? We've never released
any information about a belt.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.560
What belt? We've never released
any information about a belt.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.880
The police will never
give me justice.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.760
I have to get it myself. Oh!

01:00.800 --> 01:02.600
That sound.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.000
Neve!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.040
Neve!

01:06.560 --> 01:08.040
Neve!

01:30.920 --> 01:32.440
Victoria.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.800
Are you all right, babe?
Mm.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.520
Sorry.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.000
I'm still half asleep.
You're up early.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.640
I'm still half asleep.
You're up early.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.360
Bloody cockerel don't know
it's Saturday, does he?

01:57.120 --> 01:59.560
Earplugs, I keep telling you.
Mm.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.600
I should get in the shower.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.200
I should join you.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.400
there's no better days

02:23.080 --> 02:24.000
until I'm scared of day

02:24.000 --> 02:26.640
until I'm scared of day

02:42.800 --> 02:45.040
You're in a good mood.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.080
I guess the new pills are working.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.680
Sorry, I... I didn't mean to...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.120
I know.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
They are, though.
I haven't felt this good in years.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.160
They are, though.
I haven't felt this good in years.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.120
Kind of feels like I'm waking up.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.000
We should get away sometime.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.080
We should get away sometime.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.600
You know, a weekend somewhere,
just the two of us.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.840
Yeah. Yeah, when work
calms down a bit.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.000
I've been thinking... I know!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.160
I've been thinking... I know!

03:15.400 --> 03:18.120
..it's been a while
since we talked about it, but...

03:19.480 --> 03:20.000
..maybe it's time
to start trying again.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.480
..maybe it's time
to start trying again.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.720
I knew you were broody.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.560
Oh...you know,
we always wanted three.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.240
I know you've got a lot on.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.200
But maybe after that.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.000
God, I should get going.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.280
God, I should get going.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.880
I might have to work late tonight.
You're joking.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.400
I know, I know.
I said I'd show the Wyatts the Hall

03:42.440 --> 03:44.000
and it's the only day both
William and Michael could manage.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.040
and it's the only day both
William and Michael could manage.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.760
Mum!
Uh...

03:47.520 --> 03:49.120
Mum!

03:55.040 --> 03:57.320
Why is he taking so long?

03:57.360 --> 03:58.840
He's coming now.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.000
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.160
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.640
Happy birthday!
Bloody hell!

04:08.840 --> 04:10.320
Aw.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.080
Hey!

04:12.120 --> 04:14.960
Happy birthday, Dan.
Eugh!

04:16.920 --> 04:18.720
Open this.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.920
You really thought I'd forgotten,
didn't you?

04:21.960 --> 04:23.840
No.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.440
Put it
in the fridge when you get back...

04:29.480 --> 04:32.000
..and here's your change.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.120
..and here's your change.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.760
All right?
Sorry. What were you saying?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.080
Here you go, love.
Thanks.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.000
Victoria, I'm so sorry.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.120
Victoria, I'm so sorry.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.320
I know I was supposed
to drop it off last night.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.600
Daniel must be thinking
you've not got him anything.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.000
It's fine. Thanks for bringing it.
My fault. End-of-year drinks.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.160
It's fine. Thanks for bringing it.
My fault. End-of-year drinks.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.040
Lost track of time.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.120
Can I uh...?
Yeah, of course.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.000
It was this one Dan liked, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:04.200
It was this one Dan liked, right?

05:04.240 --> 05:07.080
He couldn't take his eyes off it
at your showing.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.200
It's a favourite of mine, too.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.400
Vic. Forgot something?
Oh...

05:23.440 --> 05:26.640
Can you even walk
in a straight line?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.000
Cheers. I'm an idiot.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.480
Cheers. I'm an idiot.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.800
She letting you come to the party?

05:31.840 --> 05:33.680
I promised
I'll be on my best behaviour.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.000
I'm already in the shit with Dan for
leaving him with the kids all day.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.320
I'm already in the shit with Dan for
leaving him with the kids all day.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.880
Wooh. Bad Parents' Club.
We're due our AGM soon.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.080
Haven't had a messy night
in far too long.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.000
I'm gonna hold you to that.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.400
I'm gonna hold you to that.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.560
So this is everything I could dig up
from the council on the Hall.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.000
Erm, blueprints, planning permits.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.560
Erm, blueprints, planning permits.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.160
It'll take a while to sort through.
Ah, there's no rush.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.160
Thanks for that.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.000
Me and Michael used to muck about
in here when we were kids.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.400
Me and Michael used to muck about
in here when we were kids.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.480
It's weird to think
we're gonna own it.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.000
I came here once and your dad
chased me off with a garden hose.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.160
I came here once and your dad
chased me off with a garden hose.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.280
Oh, yeah, sounds about right.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.240
Look at us, eh? Hotshot architect,
future hotelier...

06:23.280 --> 06:24.000
Lord of the Manor.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.640
Lord of the Manor.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.480
OK, so...

06:30.520 --> 06:32.000
Michael can't make it.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.720
Michael can't make it.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.640
Something's come up.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.160
Right...

06:38.200 --> 06:39.920
I am really sorry.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.440
It doesn't matter. I've got tons
of party stuff to sort out, anyway.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.960
OK.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.680
Oh.
Oh, my God. You're a lifesaver.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.000
No worries.
I'm sorry about earlier, by the way,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.120
No worries.
I'm sorry about earlier, by the way,

06:58.160 --> 07:00.480
standing you up at the Hall.
You're forgiven.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.640
Ah. I got caught up on a job.
It was one of those days, you know.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.000
We're running out of wine glasses.
There's some plastic ones. Drink?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.440
We're running out of wine glasses.
There's some plastic ones. Drink?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.960
Uh, I'll sort myself.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.000
Here.
Hey, sweetheart.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.240
Here.
Hey, sweetheart.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.600
What's triggered it this time?
Mum, it's nothing.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.320
It might help to talk about it.
Just...leave it.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.640
Thank you.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.040
Babe?
Could you hand these out for me?

07:31.080 --> 07:32.800
Of course.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.000
Had enough of us already?
I saw you sneaking out.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.280
Had enough of us already?
I saw you sneaking out.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.880
Busted.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.840
Hey, do you want a real drink?
No, no. I'm on the orange juice.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
Come on. Hair of the dog, mate.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.120
No chance.
Here.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.000
No, seriously!
Move your hand.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.360
No, seriously!
Move your hand.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.800
So, this is where the real party is?
It's where the real booze is.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.800
No, no.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.000
I'm getting flashbacks.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.320
I'm getting flashbacks.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.520
Us four
behind the old petrol station.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.080
Look how far we've come, eh?
Where's your stick?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.000
I've got my last operation
next week, thank God.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.400
I've got my last operation
next week, thank God.

08:16.440 --> 08:20.120
Yeah, that's right. He's bought
himself a new bike to celebrate.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.280
Seriously?
You nearly killed yourself.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.000
You've got to get back on the horse.
You're off your head.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.920
You've got to get back on the horse.
You're off your head.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.720
Can't rely on Tom to pull you
out of the wreckage every time.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.720
I will find a way to pay you back.
I owe you.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.000
Mum! Mum, Mum! Look!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.640
Mum! Mum, Mum! Look!

08:34.640 --> 08:36.560
We're making a video for Dan.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.480
Nice little private party, is it?

08:40.480 --> 08:42.200
Happy birthday, babe.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.480
Actually, I'm...not quite sure
if it's recording, Max.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.520
You made me look a right idiot.
I was busy. Couldn't get away.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.000
You were drunk or hung-over.
Or both. I've had it with this.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.160
You were drunk or hung-over.
Or both. I've had it with this.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.040
We're going into business and you
haven't signed any paperwork.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.640
Ah, piss off.
I can't do this with you.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.000
Not with the state you're in.
Chill out.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.960
You're overreacting.
I'm buying the hotel on my own.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.000
Oh, is this her?
She been poisoning you?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.920
Oh, is this her?
She been poisoning you?

09:46.960 --> 09:49.560
She doesn't have to.
Just look at you. You're a mess.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.000
You need to get your shit together
cos I'm not carrying you any more.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.280
You need to get your shit together
cos I'm not carrying you any more.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.280
William, let's just calm down.
It's none of your bleedin' business!

09:57.320 --> 09:59.120
Let's just go.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.200
You can't leave me out of this!

10:13.200 --> 10:15.280
Hey, you OK?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.000
Oh...all right.
I didn't mean to cause a scene.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.280
Oh...all right.
I didn't mean to cause a scene.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.200
Party needed livening up.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.000
William wasn't serious.
He'll change his mind.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.720
William wasn't serious.
He'll change his mind.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.960
He just likes to put me in my place,
that's all.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.640
Don't worry about it.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.000
You just need a strong coffee
and a good night's sleep.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.880
You just need a strong coffee
and a good night's sleep.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.000
You know,
you've always been good to me.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
You know,
you've always been good to me.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.080
Have you thought about,
you know, getting back out there?

10:46.120 --> 10:48.000
It's not good for you
to be on you own.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.040
It's not good for you
to be on you own.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.640
I've had my moments.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.080
Denise is a tough act to follow,
you know.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.000
Of course.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.240
Of course.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.240
Eh, we had our moments as well,
though, didn't we, back in the day?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.400
Cheap cider's got a lot
to answer for.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.000
Come here.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.520
Come here.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.000
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.560
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.320
Oh, shit.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.840
Sorry, I just thought um...

11:17.880 --> 11:20.000
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.080
Everything OK?
Yeah.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.280
Vic?

11:31.240 --> 11:34.000
Michael's still grieving.
I was just listening.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.680
It's not him I'm worried about.

11:35.720 --> 11:36.000
I'm fine.
You're not, though.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.960
I'm fine.
You're not, though.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.240
I know the signs.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.560
We should get back -
All I want from you

11:43.600 --> 11:44.000
is to understand what's going on.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.880
is to understand what's going on.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.000
I am better, you know.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.320
I am better, you know.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.440
I'm not as good as I could be,
but I am better.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.760
And having another child...

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
..I can't go through it again.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.240
You know how it affected me
after Katie and then Max.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.480
And I know we always talked about it
when I was ready

12:11.520 --> 12:14.320
and I know that you meant well
this morning, but...

12:14.360 --> 12:16.000
I just can't do it again.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.160
I just can't do it again.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.560
It's OK.
I don't want any more children.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.160
Why didn't you just tell me?
It's fine.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.000
We've got two beautiful kids.
I don't need anything else.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.440
We've got two beautiful kids.
I don't need anything else.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.800
I just want you to get help.
I don't want that, Dan.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.000
I don't want you to always
be trying to help me.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.240
I don't want you to always
be trying to help me.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.720
And I know I've been struggling
and I know it's been hard for you.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.600
But I just need you
to give me some space

12:38.640 --> 12:40.000
so I can...find my way through this,
on my own, in my own time.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.920
so I can...find my way through this,
on my own, in my own time.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.800
I just want you to be well.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.000
I've left your present in the car.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.160
I've left your present in the car.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.640
Shit!

13:03.560 --> 13:04.000
The Hall.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.240
The Hall.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.320
You run out of beer, or are you
just making a break for it?

15:09.880 --> 15:11.560
Stop it!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.640
What are you?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.480
Victoria.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.720
What happened to you, Victoria?

16:05.920 --> 16:08.000
Everyone said
that you just walked out.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.120
Everyone said
that you just walked out.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.440
I couldn't understand
why someone would do that.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.000
But all that time, you...

16:16.000 --> 16:16.840
But all that time, you...

16:24.760 --> 16:26.760
That sound.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.760
The scratching. It...

16:30.800 --> 16:32.000
That's your body.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.880
That's your body.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.520
It was you.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.000
Neve.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.120
Neve.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.440
You're Neve.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.000
Is this real?

16:48.000 --> 16:48.120
Is this real?

16:49.760 --> 16:52.000
Are you here?
Yes.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.000
I could feel you.
Ever since you came back.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.920
I could feel you.
Ever since you came back.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.000
I tried reaching out,
but I didn't...

17:04.640 --> 17:07.000
Do you know who did this?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.560
Do you know why we're here?

17:11.080 --> 17:12.000
I didn't understand before...
what you were...

17:12.000 --> 17:15.160
I didn't understand before...
what you were...

17:16.920 --> 17:20.000
..why we were connected,
but now I think I do.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.440
..why we were connected,
but now I think I do.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.000
What am I?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.640
We're the same.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.240
Who did it?

17:42.600 --> 17:44.000
Who killed us?

17:44.000 --> 17:44.600
Who killed us?

17:47.080 --> 17:48.640
I know it sounds crazy.

17:48.680 --> 17:52.000
I know I sound crazy,
but Neve was here.

17:52.000 --> 17:52.440
I know I sound crazy,
but Neve was here.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.400
Tom, sit down.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
We've examined your computer.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.560
We've examined your computer.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.400
You logged into Neve's social media
accounts after her death.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.920
I'd like to know why.
That was Neve.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.760
It should be William sat here,
not me.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.000
Tell me about your relationship
with William.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.280
Tell me about your relationship
with William.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.800
We're just friends.
More than that.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.040
Didn't you save his life
back in the day?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.000
I helped him after his bike crash.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.320
I helped him after his bike crash.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.040
I called an ambulance. That's all.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.080
I'd be pretty grateful
if I was him.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.960
Tom, are you colluding
with William Wyatt?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.880
Is he covering for you?
Are you covering for him?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.760
What?! No.
Tell me about Victoria Sands.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.480
What about her?

18:33.960 --> 18:37.480
We were mates. We all were.
It's a small town.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.480
Was William mates with her, too?

18:40.480 --> 18:44.160
Not really. You know
how he throws his weight around.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.720
So she didn't respond well to that?
Why don't you ask him?

18:49.440 --> 18:50.800
Hang on.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
Are you thinking Victoria was -

18:53.880 --> 18:56.000
I need you to tell me the truth.
How did you know about the belt?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.160
I need you to tell me the truth.
How did you know about the belt?

18:57.200 --> 19:00.120
I've already told you -
Have you, though, Tom?

19:03.800 --> 19:04.000
It doesn't matter what I say...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
It doesn't matter what I say...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
..cos I failed her.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.000
And now she's gone.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.200
And now she's gone.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.760
Are you releasing him?
Not at this stage.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.560
He had nothing to do with it.
You don't understand.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.000
There's a reason he knows
what happened to Neve.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.840
There's a reason he knows
what happened to Neve.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.800
I know what he's told you.
Tom's innocent. You know he is.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.000
William Wyatt is free. Are you
gonna let him get away with it?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.280
William Wyatt is free. Are you
gonna let him get away with it?

19:37.320 --> 19:40.240
We're not closing
any lines of enquiry.
But Tom can't go anywhere.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.440
Not until we have some answers.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.000
You're wasting time.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.520
You're wasting time.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.280
You need to let us do our jobs.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.000
Tom's...ghost stories
aren't helping anyone.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.080
Tom's...ghost stories
aren't helping anyone.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.280
Go home, Maria.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.840
I let myself in.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.000
Sorry. I should have texted.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.480
Sorry. I should have texted.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.440
I heard about Tom.
He didn't do it.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.760
I know. You see someone
at their worst enough times,

21:19.800 --> 21:20.000
you get to see who they really are.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.880
you get to see who they really are.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.360
There's no way Tom would hurt Neve.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.000
Is that why you're here?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.320
Is that why you're here?

21:30.040 --> 21:32.120
Nowhere else to go?
No.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.920
It's just a coincidence, then?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.000
It doesn't work out with Tom,
so you come back to us?

21:36.000 --> 21:36.720
It doesn't work out with Tom,
so you come back to us?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.400
No, of course not.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.480
It was never like that for me,
with Tom.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.120
I just thought
that's what I needed...

21:44.120 --> 21:46.440
..to feel closer to Neve.
But I was all wrong.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.600
You can't do this.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.040
You can't just come and go
whenever you feel like it.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.000
It's not fair on the kids.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.360
It's not fair on the kids.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.280
It's not fair on me.
I know that.

21:55.320 --> 21:59.240
You're grieving too, and I shouldn't
have shut you out. I'm sorry.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.000
But I don't need you
to rescue me or fix me.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.080
But I don't need you
to rescue me or fix me.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.320
That's not what I need from you.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.000
I know you meant well, but it
just makes me feel suffocated.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.560
I know you meant well, but it
just makes me feel suffocated.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.680
I don't know.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.560
I just need to know I can trust you.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.000
I need to know you want this
to work as much as I do.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.600
I need to know you want this
to work as much as I do.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.480
I want to come home.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.000
Grief isn't something
that either of us can fix.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.520
Grief isn't something
that either of us can fix.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.160
It'll never go away.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.000
All we can do is learn
how to live with it...together.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.440
All we can do is learn
how to live with it...together.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.080
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

22:37.800 --> 22:40.000
I hoped you would.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.120
I hoped you would.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.080
I've shown you everything I could.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.560
After that...
I can't make sense of it.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.760
It's all just...darkness and pain.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.880
I remember waking up down here.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.760
He must've thought
I was already dead.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.800
And I tried to pull myself upstairs.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.800
I was so weak.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.720
I don't know what I've become.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.560
I started to fade.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.160
I couldn't control it.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.160
Same thing happened to me.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.000
It was like...I was losing control.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.520
It was like...I was losing control.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.000
Everything else
was fading away, too.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.160
Everything else
was fading away, too.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
After a while, I just...

23:31.880 --> 23:33.600
..forgot where I was.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.000
I forgot my children.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.440
I forgot my children.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.680
Then I felt you...

23:43.560 --> 23:44.000
..and I started to remember again.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.200
..and I started to remember again.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.000
Never who killed you?

23:51.360 --> 23:52.000
Maybe Alex was right.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.160
Maybe Alex was right.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.440
What if it's not that
we can't remember?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.000
What if it's...
that we don't want to?

24:00.000 --> 24:00.840
What if it's...
that we don't want to?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.280
Why would we do that?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.240
Because we're afraid.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.840
It's been a lot to deal with,
you know.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.000
You don't have to worry
about your dad.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.360
He's gone.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.640
He's never coming back here.
Good.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.000
Officers found blood at the hotel.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Officers found blood at the hotel.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.480
It's not Neve's.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.960
It's older.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.000
They're still doing tests.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.600
They're still doing tests.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.960
The hotel?

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Oh, I never understood why he was
so obsessed with that place.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.800
Oh, I never understood why he was
so obsessed with that place.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.920
It's been nothing but trouble.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.000
I have to go.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.400
I have to go.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.600
It's OK, Mum.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.680
'You're gonna have
to grow up someday soon, Will.'

25:35.720 --> 25:36.000
Feels like a lifetime ago.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.640
Feels like a lifetime ago.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.320
It was your dad's birthday,
wasn't it?

25:41.720 --> 25:43.880
What's this?

25:43.920 --> 25:44.000
Oh, I took a box of old photos
out from the attic.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.560
Oh, I took a box of old photos
out from the attic.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.720
I thought it might be nice
to look through them together.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.000
We found a hard drive
with a bunch of videos, too.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.160
We found a hard drive
with a bunch of videos, too.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.760
'Mum. Look.'
I remember that day.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.000
'Happy birthday, babe.'
It was the last time we saw her.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.960
'Happy birthday, babe.'
It was the last time we saw her.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.880
I'm sorry, Katie.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.000
I should never have said what I did.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.040
I should never have said what I did.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.840
It's OK.
It's not OK.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.720
I should have been here.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.000
And the last thing I should have
done was take things out on you.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.920
And the last thing I should have
done was take things out on you.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.000
I'm not going anywhere.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.400
I'm not going anywhere.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.600
I can't keep losing people.
I just can't do it.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.360
Come here.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.120
I know I'm not your mum.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.640
But we are family, aren't we?

26:39.520 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.
Come on.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.440
Yeah.
Come on.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.280
Let's have a look
through everything.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.000
Look. It's you and Mum.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.920
Oh, yeah.
Dad's birthday.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.000
What's this?

26:56.000 --> 26:56.080
What's this?

26:56.120 --> 26:57.680
Oh, my God.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.600
It's when you started
getting into photography.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.840
Everything was always
a really weird angle.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.000
I'm better now.
Now you just blame your camera.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.200
I'm better now.
Now you just blame your camera.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.800
It IS broken.
I was wondering what happened.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.640
Look...

27:13.440 --> 27:17.080
Just started playing up.
Photos kept coming out weird.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.000
Oh, my God.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.440
Oh, my God.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.000
William. I'd like to have a word.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.640
William. I'd like to have a word.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.440
I've said everything
I want to say to you.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.960
Either arrest me
or get off my property.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.640
It's a simple question.
I thought you had Tom Rees.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.000
Why you sniffing around me again?

27:49.040 --> 27:50.840
Just trying to build up
a complete picture.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.000
If you'd be more comfortable
talking down the station...

27:52.000 --> 27:53.400
If you'd be more comfortable
talking down the station...

27:55.760 --> 27:57.800
This conversation is over.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.000
What about Victoria Sands?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.360
What about Victoria Sands?

28:03.360 --> 28:06.080
What about her?
You were friends. Is that right?

28:07.840 --> 28:08.000
What's that got to do with Neve?
Did Victoria bother you?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.640
What's that got to do with Neve?
Did Victoria bother you?

28:11.680 --> 28:13.920
She was a successful woman,
wasn't she?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.000
She think a bit too much
of herself, too?

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
She think a bit too much
of herself, too?

28:22.040 --> 28:24.000
You want to talk to me again...
you call my lawyer.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.280
You want to talk to me again...
you call my lawyer.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.640
Oh, William...

28:31.680 --> 28:32.000
Tom Reese says
he saw Neve after she died.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.040
Tom Reese says
he saw Neve after she died.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.760
Said Neve spoke to him,
told him things.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.120
Tom Rees is a drunk.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.880
He said you could see her, too.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.920
Maria. Hi.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.520
So, what am I looking at here?

29:01.560 --> 29:03.040
These marks.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.000
Max has been taking
lots of photos recently.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.360
Max has been taking
lots of photos recently.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.240
It's his way of dealing with things.

29:08.280 --> 29:12.000
All these. Max took them when he
thought he could sense a presence.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.120
All these. Max took them when he
thought he could sense a presence.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.960
Has Tom been talking to Max, too?
No, you don't understand.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
I do. Grief plays tricks on us...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I do. Grief plays tricks on us...

29:21.040 --> 29:24.880
makes us see people we've lost
in the middle of a crowd, on a bus.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.920
Sounds like Tom's been taking
advantage of that.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.000
He's telling the truth.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.480
He's telling the truth.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.480
And this is the closest thing
I've got to actual proof.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.720
They're Neve.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.000
They're all Neve.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.480
They're all Neve.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.560
All I can see are smudges on photos.
I know it's a stretch. I know that.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.000
I'm just asking you
to open your mind for a minute.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.520
I'm just asking you
to open your mind for a minute.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.720
I'm really sorry, Maria,

29:46.760 --> 29:48.960
but I feel
that Tom's manipulating you.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.000
Alex Wyatt.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.280
Alex Wyatt.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.280
She can see Neve
and she didn't even know her before.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.480
Call Alex.
She'll tell you the truth.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.000
Neve?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.280
Neve?

30:20.600 --> 30:22.480
Are you here?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.960
I've been out there chasing shadows.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.000
Because I couldn't face it.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.040
Because I couldn't face it.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.600
If you don't,
you'll end up like me - lost.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.000
Don't you want to know the truth?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.760
Don't you want to know the truth?

30:50.960 --> 30:52.520
I don't think I can.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.920
It's OK.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.200
I can do it.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.880
I'm stronger now.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.960
I'm back in the woods.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
That night.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.760
That night.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.280
What's there?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.720
It's OK, Neve.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.000
You won't be alone this time.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.440
You won't be alone this time.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.720
I'm scared.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.560
I'm here with you.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.320
I remember this.
'You think you're better than me?'

32:23.320 --> 32:24.000
No-one can ever be good enough
for you. You're a fucking head case.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.960
No-one can ever be good enough
for you. You're a fucking head case.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.480
'No, you don't get
to walk away from me.'

32:31.320 --> 32:32.000
And don't think this is over! Hey!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.760
And don't think this is over! Hey!

32:34.960 --> 32:36.600
'You hear me?!'

32:36.640 --> 32:38.240
Victoria?

32:42.360 --> 32:44.720
It's all right, Neve. I'm here.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.080
Dad?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.920
Alex?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.120
What you doing here?

33:32.920 --> 33:35.120
Oh, love.
I want the truth.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.000
Look me in the eyes and tell me you
had nothing to do with Neve's death.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.960
Look me in the eyes and tell me you
had nothing to do with Neve's death.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.680
Oh, my God.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.000
I never touched her.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.560
I never touched her.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.120
Never.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.400
There's things...

33:59.440 --> 34:00.000
..that I can't tell you. I just...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.560
..that I can't tell you. I just...

34:02.760 --> 34:04.600
I can't.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.920
But I would never hurt Neve...

34:09.400 --> 34:11.200
..and I need you to believe that.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.280
But you know who it was.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.000
You do.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.040
You do.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.840
Alex, please, love, don't.
Tell me.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.000
Shit.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.960
Where am I?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.800
Dad?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.280
It's not.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.520
You would never.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.000
Neve was murdered.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.880
Neve was murdered.

35:13.800 --> 35:18.200
She was 19 years old
and she was choked to death.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.000
Can you imagine
what that must be like,

35:20.000 --> 35:20.800
Can you imagine
what that must be like,

35:20.840 --> 35:23.000
how scared she must have been?

35:28.240 --> 35:30.560
And then her body was just dumped...

35:32.160 --> 35:35.920
..just...thrown away
like she was nothing.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.000
How would you feel if that was me?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.440
How would you feel if that was me?

36:36.520 --> 36:39.240
What are you doing out here
on your own, Neve?

36:43.280 --> 36:45.080
Can I have a lift?

36:45.120 --> 36:47.160
Yeah, of course. Get in.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.360
You been at that party?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.000
Here...
You have to be gentle with it.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.240
Here...
You have to be gentle with it.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.000
I've got it.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.360
Where's Joe, anyway?

37:03.320 --> 37:04.000
Have you two had a row or something?
We broke up.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.920
Have you two had a row or something?
We broke up.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.440
Sorry to hear that.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.920
Here.
Come on.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.360
What are you doing?
Calm down. I'm just helping you.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.000
I am calm. Get the fuck off me.
Hey, I wasn't touching you.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.960
I am calm. Get the fuck off me.
Hey, I wasn't touching you.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.720
You know what?
Forget it. I'll walk.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.040
Let me out.
Not when you're being like this.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.000
Open the door.
Sit back and shut up

37:36.000 --> 37:36.920
Open the door.
Sit back and shut up

37:36.960 --> 37:38.920
and show some fucking gratitude!

37:42.560 --> 37:44.000
If you don't open the door...

37:44.000 --> 37:44.200
If you don't open the door...

37:45.520 --> 37:47.000
You'll do what?

37:53.560 --> 37:55.160
Wow!

37:55.200 --> 37:57.440
I see where Joe gets his issues.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.000
What's that supposed to mean?

38:00.000 --> 38:00.280
What's that supposed to mean?

38:01.120 --> 38:03.200
Come on.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.680
Just look at yourself.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.120
You're a fucking psycho.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.440
Wait. Hey!

38:18.480 --> 38:20.200
Come here!

38:20.240 --> 38:21.920
Hey!

38:30.320 --> 38:32.000
Alex...

38:32.000 --> 38:32.040
Alex...

38:34.280 --> 38:36.120
..you need to go.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.640
What's this?

38:43.880 --> 38:45.720
What have you told her?

38:48.120 --> 38:52.240
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.720
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?

38:57.320 --> 38:59.080
Back at the house...

39:00.200 --> 39:02.320
..it was like old times, weren't it?

39:03.120 --> 39:04.000
Me and you.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.920
Me and you.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.760
It's always been...
me and you, hasn't it, Vic?

39:14.040 --> 39:16.200
You're joking, aren't you?

39:26.440 --> 39:28.000
Go home, Michael. You're drunk.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.080
Go home, Michael. You're drunk.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.000
I was never good enough for you,
was I?

39:36.000 --> 39:36.280
I was never good enough for you,
was I?

39:37.240 --> 39:39.720
Jesus, we had a drunken fumble
in high school

39:39.760 --> 39:42.760
and you've followed me around
like a puppy ever since.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.000
And I try and be nice - I'm always
trying to be fucking nice -

39:44.000 --> 39:46.680
And I try and be nice - I'm always
trying to be fucking nice -

39:46.720 --> 39:50.000
cos no-one says what they
really think around here, do they?

39:50.040 --> 39:52.000
What do you really think of me?

39:52.000 --> 39:52.240
What do you really think of me?

39:55.880 --> 39:57.920
Get out of my way.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.000
You answer me.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.560
You answer me.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.280
Get away from me!

40:03.320 --> 40:06.720
You think you're better than us!
Better than Joseph! You always have!

40:06.760 --> 40:08.000
Better than you, that's for sure!

40:08.000 --> 40:08.400
Better than you, that's for sure!

40:08.440 --> 40:11.960
You think you can just hit me
and get away with it? Nah.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.360
Fuck that.
Everyone's gonna hear about this.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.800
Everyone's gonna know what you are.
You...

40:23.240 --> 40:24.000
I feel sorry for you.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.240
I feel sorry for you.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.440
'Neve.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.040
Neve.'

40:52.960 --> 40:54.080
Neve.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.000
Neve.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.600
Neve.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.640
Come back.

41:05.240 --> 41:07.600
Neve. Neve, open your eyes!

41:23.560 --> 41:25.240
I saw him.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.000
It was Michael.

41:28.000 --> 41:28.240
It was Michael.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.600
Michael killed us.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.320
He can't get away with this.
