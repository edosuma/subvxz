00:00.007 --> 00:00.968
Talon:
<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:01.056 --> 00:03.544
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:03.632 --> 00:06.171
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.</i>

00:06.281 --> 00:08.992
<i>I cut off the points of my ears
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:09.203 --> 00:11.247
<i>A tiny creature
lives inside me,</i>

00:11.335 --> 00:13.226
<i>passed to me
by my dying mother.</i>

00:13.320 --> 00:16.029
<i>It gives me the power to open
portals to another world</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:18.607
<i>and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.</i>

00:18.695 --> 00:21.195
<i>But I can only summon them
when I have their names,</i>

00:21.304 --> 00:23.146
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:23.234 --> 00:25.966
<i>The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:26.054 --> 00:29.544
<i>at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.</i>

00:29.632 --> 00:31.548
Mistress: <i>Previously, on</i>
"The Outpost"...

00:32.189 --> 00:34.269
( crowd gasping )

00:35.356 --> 00:37.234
- You're alive.
- We need to leave.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.859
Garret, what is going on?

00:39.234 --> 00:40.570
What are you doing?

00:40.681 --> 00:43.964
Admit the truth.
You are no queen.

00:44.052 --> 00:45.709
- Talon: Garret's got Gwynn.
- I am coming with you.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.922
She left you
on your wedding day,

00:47.009 --> 00:49.078
and after all that,
you still want to rescue her.

00:53.912 --> 00:56.375
This key unlocks
a great power that could solve

00:56.463 --> 00:58.275
the problems
of our people and your Queen.

00:58.363 --> 01:00.750
I think it belongs to shrine
called Vor-Anden.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.654
Let's go get it.

01:04.581 --> 01:08.144
- Captain Spears?
- Lock him away. And double the guards.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.664
I know every guard in the Outpost.
I don't know you.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:21.104 --> 01:22.936
I'd keep that bow ready
if I were you.

01:23.114 --> 01:25.242
Not to mention the place
is crawling with Prime Order.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.257
Don't you worry.
From this position,

01:27.345 --> 01:30.695
I could put a bolt between
a human's eyes before you can blink.

01:31.329 --> 01:33.742
- ( Growling )
- ( baby crying )

01:33.938 --> 01:35.515
It has a baby.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.851
- ( Growling )
- ( baby crying )

01:46.599 --> 01:47.729
( crying )

02:05.449 --> 02:08.579
( panting )

02:11.209 --> 02:12.982
( panting )

02:13.631 --> 02:15.248
Thank you.

02:16.448 --> 02:18.168
Don't talk to it.

02:20.295 --> 02:22.719
Whoever you are,
thank you.

02:25.092 --> 02:26.675
Talon: I'd forgotten
what it was like.

02:26.957 --> 02:28.272
Humans.

02:28.762 --> 02:30.845
You can save their baby
and they still hate you.

02:31.467 --> 02:35.014
They don't hate you.
They're afraid of you.

02:35.508 --> 02:38.248
Must be these terrifying
pointy ears.

02:59.809 --> 03:01.949
I demand you honor the deal.

03:02.194 --> 03:04.114
Whether you marry
the fool or not,

03:04.269 --> 03:05.973
Tobin's lands are all mine.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.129
You can't expect Tobin
to still marry her

03:08.217 --> 03:09.487
after she absconded
with another man.

03:09.574 --> 03:11.106
Oh, she was kidnapped!

03:11.194 --> 03:14.356
Kidnapped? It looked very much
to me like she went willingly.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.926
- Mistress: No, she...
- Enough!

03:18.177 --> 03:21.101
Now if Lord Milus takes
a moment to calm down,

03:21.189 --> 03:23.863
maybe something satisfactory
could be negotiated.

03:26.235 --> 03:29.082
There now.
Doesn't that feel better?

03:29.882 --> 03:31.125
What do you offer?

03:31.439 --> 03:33.340
And what do you expect
in return?

03:33.451 --> 03:36.215
Well, for a start,
I expect patience.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.254
Your deal may be
fully honored in time.

03:39.371 --> 03:41.264
Meaning you would
still marry him.

03:41.891 --> 03:44.044
He must get well
before that decision is made.

03:44.132 --> 03:45.403
And if he doesn't survive?

03:45.491 --> 03:49.414
Tobin is receiving
the finest possible care.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.168
Aye, from your son
the barkeep.

03:52.511 --> 03:54.415
Just the sort of
medication he's used to.

03:54.518 --> 03:56.332
- You...
- Elinor.

03:56.972 --> 03:58.782
- Elinor.
- Enough talk.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.571
I want a written deed
to Tobin's lands tonight.

04:03.659 --> 04:05.369
Or else you'll what?

04:14.037 --> 04:16.910
I was promised all your lands
because you'd be king.

04:17.028 --> 04:20.464
Yeah, well, that deal's
off the table for now.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.674
Not a problem, cousin.

04:32.130 --> 04:35.213
You stay here with these women
and play house.

04:35.487 --> 04:38.167
I'll just take my army
and go and take what's mine.

04:40.854 --> 04:42.520
There will be a reckoning.

04:47.432 --> 04:51.121
You know, your, uh... your eyes
aren't dilating like they should.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.176
There's nothing wrong
with me, Janzo.

04:53.264 --> 04:55.963
Listen, if you don't want my help, I've
got much more important things to be doing,

04:56.050 --> 04:57.629
like curing the Plaguelings,
for example.

04:57.716 --> 05:00.169
Well, then maybe
you should get on that,

05:00.397 --> 05:02.895
because there is nothing
wrong with me

05:04.027 --> 05:07.590
except that I know the truth
and you do not.

05:07.719 --> 05:10.543
Fine! Rot in here.

05:22.528 --> 05:24.567
There goes our last hope
of victory.

05:24.926 --> 05:28.809
What, Milus?
We're better off without him.

05:28.897 --> 05:30.121
We needed his men.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.738
You still have mine.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.879
Yes, the question is why,
after what I did to you?

05:37.067 --> 05:38.770
You're the rightful queen,

05:39.044 --> 05:41.278
the best and only way
to take back the Realm.

05:41.366 --> 05:43.166
It doesn't have anything
to do with the fact

05:43.254 --> 05:44.886
that you're past the point
of no return

05:45.027 --> 05:46.403
when it comes to
the Prime Order?

05:47.549 --> 05:48.926
That, too.

06:13.775 --> 06:15.835
I'd forgotten
what they looked like.

06:18.515 --> 06:20.475
I guess I take them
for granted.

06:32.997 --> 06:35.980
- What?
- How old were you

06:36.068 --> 06:37.362
when you cut the points off?

06:39.722 --> 06:41.112
I don't know.

06:43.132 --> 06:44.729
Probably ten.

06:45.444 --> 06:48.245
- Did it hurt?
- Obviously.

06:48.694 --> 06:50.526
I meant emotionally.

06:51.665 --> 06:54.648
You must have felt like you were
cutting off a piece of who you were.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.797
Mostly I just wanted
to blend in to survive.

07:01.565 --> 07:03.768
As far as I knew,
I was the last one left.

07:04.199 --> 07:06.088
And do you regret it now?

07:07.148 --> 07:09.501
Now that you know
there are more of us?

07:09.759 --> 07:12.034
How can I regret something
that kept me alive?

07:26.544 --> 07:28.704
I haven't touched one
since I was a kid.

07:31.426 --> 07:33.463
They're a lot softer
than I remember.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.018
You've never touched a
Blackblood man at all, have you?

07:44.694 --> 07:46.620
Can't be all that different
to a human man.

07:46.955 --> 07:50.135
Well, you see, there's
a bond between Blackbloods

07:50.689 --> 07:52.760
that you'll never get
with a human.

08:08.805 --> 08:10.244
Well?

08:14.739 --> 08:17.739
<i>( Music playing )</i>

09:01.396 --> 09:03.373
There's the one
with devil's ears.

09:35.799 --> 09:38.427
- Ten against two.
- Always liked a good challenge.

09:40.809 --> 09:43.749
( Grunting )

10:31.680 --> 10:33.272
I'd run if I was you.

10:35.153 --> 10:36.426
That was fun.

10:36.653 --> 10:38.061
What was?

10:38.261 --> 10:40.694
Fighting side by side
with another Blackblood.

10:41.312 --> 10:43.053
Come on, admit it.
It was fun.

10:43.907 --> 10:45.842
Yeah, I guess
it was kind of nice.

10:50.094 --> 10:52.936
<i>( Music playing )</i>

10:56.983 --> 10:58.700
One of my affiliates
informed me

10:58.788 --> 11:02.241
that Milus' army
left the city two days ago.

11:02.649 --> 11:04.686
- One of your affiliates?
- Yes.

11:04.774 --> 11:07.527
Do you think he's making
a move on our... your lands?

11:07.617 --> 11:09.490
Tobin's been gone from home
a long time.

11:09.608 --> 11:11.965
What's to stop Milus taking
more than he was promised?

11:12.053 --> 11:13.793
He can never breach
my city walls.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.341
Each of my men are worth
three of his.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.139
What, without someone
to lead them?

11:17.266 --> 11:19.196
I'm not leaving here,
if that's what you're getting at.

11:19.283 --> 11:21.453
What if the Prime Order
attacks the Outpost?

11:26.991 --> 11:31.062
I think there's no reason
why Lord Tobin should leave.

11:31.213 --> 11:32.570
Thank you.

11:32.903 --> 11:36.765
After all, he does have
his trusted advisor.

11:36.975 --> 11:39.701
My most esteemed sister
Gertie can head home

11:39.789 --> 11:41.224
and look after his affairs.

11:41.312 --> 11:42.898
I belong by my Lord's side.

11:42.986 --> 11:45.275
You belong where
your Lord needs you,

11:45.363 --> 11:46.516
and right now he needs you

11:46.603 --> 11:49.383
back home guarding
his territory.

11:50.942 --> 11:52.828
Isn't that right, milord?

11:53.052 --> 11:55.375
Well, if Gertie thinks
she can manage.

11:55.906 --> 11:58.156
Mistress: Oh,
I think she'll manage splendidly.

12:00.213 --> 12:01.843
Well, that's settled then.

12:05.961 --> 12:07.767
What is your cousin up to?

12:22.266 --> 12:23.718
Change over.

12:33.313 --> 12:34.968
Hello again, my friend.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.234
No.

12:47.053 --> 12:49.786

12:49.873 --> 12:51.473
No! No!

12:53.455 --> 12:54.995
( Screaming )

12:57.343 --> 12:59.256
No! You think
I'm a bloody fool?

12:59.343 --> 13:01.256
( Screaming )

13:01.343 --> 13:04.863
Garret! Garret!

13:07.073 --> 13:09.856
No! Garret! Garret!

13:09.943 --> 13:12.026
Munt: Janzo,
what the hell's going on?

13:12.215 --> 13:15.904
Munt! Munt! Munt!

13:17.788 --> 13:20.269
You cowardly little bastard!
He tried to kill me!

13:20.357 --> 13:21.912
He did?

13:23.390 --> 13:27.875
And you, all night
you can't bloody shut up,

13:27.963 --> 13:32.529
and then you're as quiet as a little
mouse are you, when he tries to kill me?

13:32.654 --> 13:35.769
For what it's worth,
I didn't want him to kill you.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.459
I just wanted him
to let me out.

13:37.547 --> 13:42.170
Shut up! You maniacal
little... little backstabber!

13:42.435 --> 13:45.451
You should be made into a
Plagueling because of that.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.498
All it would take
is one little prick.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.623
Have you forgotten?
I don't use colipsum.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.051
Right?
And I know you, Janzo.

14:01.109 --> 14:02.418
You would never
actually hurt me.

14:02.506 --> 14:03.816
- Not really.
- No?

14:03.974 --> 14:05.553
No.

14:05.823 --> 14:06.967
No, you're probably right.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.086
Munt, punch him in the face.

14:08.173 --> 14:10.013
- Huh?
- What?

14:11.366 --> 14:13.222
Oh, hey, hey, Munt.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.394
Oh, Munt.

14:19.461 --> 14:21.045
What you gonna do
with this one?

14:21.133 --> 14:22.425
He's still living.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.449
Maybe we take him to Gwynn
for questioning.

14:24.558 --> 14:26.481
I've got a place
we could put him.

14:26.576 --> 14:28.675
Mum will want to ask him
some questions.

14:29.005 --> 14:32.348
- Thanks, Munt.
- ( grunting )

14:32.567 --> 14:34.293
This fella tried
to kill Janzo.

14:34.381 --> 14:36.339
Needs some questioning,
I reckon.

14:36.453 --> 14:38.668
- Was he guarding Garret?
- He was indeed.

14:38.768 --> 14:41.261
( Grunts )

14:42.287 --> 14:44.589
Who are you working for?
The Three?

14:50.282 --> 14:52.915
( Grunting )

14:53.674 --> 14:55.261
Hail to The Three.

14:55.863 --> 14:57.285
It figures. All right,

14:57.373 --> 15:00.558
how many more of you
have we got around here?

15:03.242 --> 15:04.355
Turn him Plagueling.

15:04.443 --> 15:06.446
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

15:06.534 --> 15:10.175
Ain't no more. I joined up with
the false queen's guard last week.

15:10.323 --> 15:12.199
She ain't no false queen.

15:12.287 --> 15:17.100
- Go on. Off you go.
- No, no, no, no!

15:17.188 --> 15:18.371
( Grunting )

15:18.493 --> 15:20.276
And, uh, Mister Brogan,

15:20.363 --> 15:22.965
after those fellas have
had their fun with him...

15:23.053 --> 15:25.075
- ( screaming ) 
- ...can you strap him down until he turns?

15:25.163 --> 15:27.465
- Munt, you're with me.
- Yes, I am.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.294
No, no. No, Munt.

15:29.382 --> 15:31.769
Munt, Munt.
It means follow me.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.652
Follow me.

15:33.740 --> 15:35.077
- Follow me.
- Now?

15:35.212 --> 15:37.854
Yeah, this way. Come on.

15:43.099 --> 15:46.347
- Okay, Munt?
- Yeah?

15:46.435 --> 15:50.754
I have decided it's time to extend
your scope of responsibilities.

15:50.842 --> 15:53.855
Yeah.
I think that's right, yeah.

15:53.949 --> 15:55.282
What does that mean?

15:55.533 --> 15:57.972
Lord Tobin is now ally
to the kingdom,

15:58.060 --> 16:00.535
which means Aegisford
is part of the crown lands.

16:00.623 --> 16:02.605
Ooh, I went there
when I was a boy

16:02.693 --> 16:04.574
to visit Auntie Gertrusha.

16:04.699 --> 16:07.738
And you're going back there
again with her tomorrow.

16:07.903 --> 16:10.988
Ah. What for?

16:11.303 --> 16:14.168
To extend your responsibility.

16:18.194 --> 16:22.167
I want you to collect taxes,

16:22.449 --> 16:27.169
and I want you to spy
on your Auntie Gertie for me.

16:29.587 --> 16:31.634
- What for?
- I don't trust her

16:31.738 --> 16:33.050
as far as I could throw her.

16:33.138 --> 16:35.972
Oh, yeah.
That won't be very far, Mum.

16:38.049 --> 16:42.511
Okay, just send me a bird

16:42.599 --> 16:45.512
if and when
she comes back here,

16:45.600 --> 16:48.746
and let me know
if she does anything...

16:48.902 --> 16:50.550
Anything that I need
to know about.

16:50.638 --> 16:54.597
All right, will do.
I won't let you down, Mum.

16:54.754 --> 16:56.326
Somehow I doubt that.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.519
Yeah. Yeah.

17:06.729 --> 17:08.962
Don't think you've seen
the last of me, Elinor.

17:09.050 --> 17:12.117
Oh, come on, Gertie.
Why so glum?

17:12.205 --> 17:14.605
Not long ago,
you were just a mere servant.

17:14.693 --> 17:17.790
Now you are first Baroness
to the new Realm!

17:17.877 --> 17:19.823
You can thank me later!

17:21.986 --> 17:24.698
- Bye, Mum.
- Oh, bye, love.

17:24.786 --> 17:26.676
Be good.

17:26.939 --> 17:30.579
<i>( Music playing )</i>

17:34.919 --> 17:37.612
Tobin's army is marching away
from the Outpost.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.295
Just as I had hoped he'd do.

17:39.383 --> 17:41.558
That makes it even easier
to take the Outpost

17:41.646 --> 17:43.786
and its so-called queen.

18:06.624 --> 18:08.544
How's the prisoner?

18:08.982 --> 18:10.982
Well, luckily for the Outpost,
I'm still alive,

18:11.079 --> 18:13.009
no thanks to your
so-called guards.

18:16.203 --> 18:18.116
- I was talking about Garret.
- Oh.

18:18.242 --> 18:19.810
No change.
Still an idiot.

18:32.922 --> 18:35.240
How many traitors
are in the Outpost?

18:35.770 --> 18:37.662
I didn't know about that one.

18:42.462 --> 18:44.095
I'm so sorry, Gwynn.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.677
I haven't been myself lately.

18:46.962 --> 18:48.185
Really?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.732
I was wrong to doubt you.

18:52.530 --> 18:57.453
The things I said, I just...
I don't really understand

18:57.654 --> 18:59.792
what's going on.
I've been so confused lately.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.888
It's all right.
It's all right.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.883
Whatever you're going through,
Janzo is going to set you right.

19:05.971 --> 19:07.161
Ha!

19:08.834 --> 19:12.107
I called you false,
and a liar.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.646
That was wrong of me.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.394
I know you, Gwynn.
You're a good person.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.075
You're someone
I've always loved.

19:26.262 --> 19:28.802
I love you, too, Garret.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.725
Don't worry.

19:30.982 --> 19:32.755
Janzo is going
to get you ba...

19:32.842 --> 19:34.405
- ( grunting )
- Janzo: Guards!

19:34.755 --> 19:36.378
( Grunting )

19:36.466 --> 19:38.736
( gasping )

19:45.637 --> 19:47.378
Are you all right?

19:49.665 --> 19:51.154
Fix him.

19:51.242 --> 19:52.565
Or kill him.

19:53.408 --> 19:55.252
I can't bear
to see him like this.

20:28.612 --> 20:32.216
Milus? Could he have
decided to join us?

20:32.639 --> 20:35.669
He's up to something.
Look how his men are spread.

20:48.935 --> 20:52.145
His Lordship
Baron Milus Aegisford

20:52.232 --> 20:54.335
bids greetings
to the false queen.

20:54.422 --> 20:55.802
False queen?

20:56.705 --> 20:58.310
Please correct her.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.591
Want to try that again?

21:03.679 --> 21:06.474
His Lordship has two demands.

21:06.699 --> 21:10.255
Turn over Rosmund
and all others will be spared,

21:10.654 --> 21:14.372
so long as they pledge fealty
to my Lord Milus.

21:14.555 --> 21:16.747
A little closer this time.

21:18.883 --> 21:21.849
Tell Milus that if he comes
anywhere near my walls,

21:21.937 --> 21:25.130
I will put an arrow through each
one of his short-sighted eyes.

21:25.311 --> 21:27.114
And if he doesn't
turn around and leave,

21:27.342 --> 21:30.919
then I will nail his body
to my gates alive.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.714
- Now what?
- We give him a few minutes to cool off

21:41.802 --> 21:44.323
- and then we parlay.
- What?

21:44.411 --> 21:46.345
It's customary
among our people.

21:46.432 --> 21:49.794
You trade insults, put on a show of
force, and then negotiate.

21:49.882 --> 21:52.555
Yes, I know what parlay means,
but who's "we"?

21:52.819 --> 21:54.357
Well, you and I, of course.

21:55.191 --> 21:57.839
- Parlay?
- Parlay. Ready my horse.

21:57.927 --> 22:01.034
No, no, you can't go out there.
It's not safe.

22:01.122 --> 22:04.597
Besides, a parlay is supposed to be
between persons of equal stations.

22:04.685 --> 22:08.232
- So you want to go alone?
- I'll saddle up.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.606
- Do you trust him?
- I take it you don't.

22:15.841 --> 22:17.214
After what you did to him,

22:17.302 --> 22:19.865
no more than a flea
on a dog's ass.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.779
- Go with him.
- Me?

22:24.271 --> 22:26.474
Well, I can't
very well go, can I?

22:29.256 --> 22:31.107
The things I do for you.

22:42.937 --> 22:45.083
Thought you'd abandoned
your upstart false queen

22:45.171 --> 22:47.464
and ran away
to protect what's yours.

22:47.552 --> 22:49.771
I'm only going to
give you this one chance.

22:50.091 --> 22:51.964
Turn your army around
and leave.

22:52.052 --> 22:53.245
Or what?

22:53.332 --> 22:55.255
The Queen's guard
will be forced to attack.

22:56.099 --> 22:57.740
What, all three of them?

22:58.471 --> 23:00.700
With your unit gone,
you've got nothing.

23:00.788 --> 23:04.068
Queen Rosmund can march a thousand
soldiers out of those gates,

23:04.156 --> 23:06.558
and they will cut through
your goat-skin hides

23:06.646 --> 23:08.435
like hot knives
through butter.

23:08.523 --> 23:10.866
I have 3,000 fighting men.

23:11.263 --> 23:14.599
Your untrained army of boys
doesn't stand a chance.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.443
We'll parlay.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.193
I thought that's what
we were doing.

23:19.292 --> 23:22.271
- In private.
- Just you, cousin?

23:22.574 --> 23:24.048
I thought I was meant
to go with you.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.943
I'll talk to Tobin
or to nobody.

23:27.193 --> 23:29.419
You're going to have
to trust me, Elinor.

23:29.732 --> 23:31.142
Yeah, right.

23:40.935 --> 23:43.208
And there they go alone.

23:44.552 --> 23:46.515
Your new man's not going
to betray us, is he?

23:46.602 --> 23:49.662
Janzo, get back to work.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.404
Why are you doing this,
Milus?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.769
I've given you everything
you ever wanted.

23:59.942 --> 24:02.195
You did, and that's
opened my eyes

24:02.282 --> 24:04.036
that I could have
so much more.

24:04.281 --> 24:06.995
You can't take this Outpost.
You don't have enough men.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.466
That's true.

24:08.672 --> 24:10.927
And yet, good Queen Rosmund
can't drive me away

24:11.015 --> 24:12.943
because she also
doesn't have enough men.

24:13.271 --> 24:15.312
So we have ourselves
a stand off.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.044
You plan to starve us out.

24:22.091 --> 24:23.594
Ooh!

24:24.544 --> 24:25.911
Ooh, ooh.

24:25.999 --> 24:28.279
This saddle is killing me.

24:28.482 --> 24:29.779
Oy.

24:30.032 --> 24:32.732
You want to help an old lady
off this beast?

24:35.812 --> 24:37.685
Thank you.
Oh, goodness!

24:38.990 --> 24:40.405
Thank you.

24:40.608 --> 24:43.599
See? We can all be civil.

24:44.475 --> 24:45.788
Wow.

24:46.154 --> 24:47.715
It's good to see you, Deven.

24:47.802 --> 24:50.115
It's good to see you, too.

24:50.591 --> 24:55.396
So, um, are you...
Are you still selling?

24:55.622 --> 24:58.395
- Aye.
- Gods must be smiling on us.

24:58.482 --> 25:02.630
You and I stand to make
a fortune here today.

25:02.829 --> 25:05.380
How are you going to
get me the colipsum?

25:08.301 --> 25:11.344
I'll send a man over
after second watch.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.716
You just make sure
no one kills him.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.872
Well, I'll be out there myself.

25:21.501 --> 25:23.274
The woman left you
at the altar.

25:23.495 --> 25:25.419
That's not worth dying for.

25:26.802 --> 25:28.172
What are you proposing?

25:30.506 --> 25:34.129
You come return to Aegisford,
sit in your father's seat,

25:34.254 --> 25:37.694
a Lord in your own right,
but under my governance.

25:39.112 --> 25:40.568
Your price?

25:42.042 --> 25:43.435
Bring me the so-called queen

25:43.614 --> 25:45.575
so I can deliver her
to the Prime Order.

25:45.663 --> 25:47.794
You'll save some lives,
and my Outpost

25:47.882 --> 25:50.708
won't be burned
and torn down in the process.

25:54.532 --> 25:58.786
Do we have a deal, cousin?

26:15.499 --> 26:16.499
And?

26:19.960 --> 26:22.138
He's planning
on starving us out.

26:23.110 --> 26:26.304
- Elinor, any ideas?
- I've got some thoughts.

26:27.202 --> 26:29.327
Just give me some time
to sketch it out.

26:31.926 --> 26:34.239
- Could your army reach us in time?
- Perhaps,

26:34.451 --> 26:37.257
if a rider from Aegisford
leaves now to turn them around.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.171
Then we must send all our birds

26:40.278 --> 26:41.908
to get word to Aegisford.

26:44.076 --> 26:45.952
<i>( Music playing )</i>

27:18.813 --> 27:20.957
I don't think
any of them got through.

27:22.890 --> 27:24.238
Zed: Much like the Outpost,

27:24.326 --> 27:26.459
this place was once
a stronghold for our people.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.394
This history as you tell it
doesn't make sense to me.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.199
I remember my village.
Our people were peaceful.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.332
We didn't build fortresses,

27:38.050 --> 27:39.449
and we didn't even
hunt to kill.

27:39.537 --> 27:41.753
The people in your village
rejected our ways.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.963
They thought
they could choose passivity.

27:44.213 --> 27:47.355
They underestimated
the humans' capacity for hate.

27:49.849 --> 27:51.852
Gods, I've missed this world.

27:51.993 --> 27:54.425
Just imagine if our people
were here, Talon.

27:54.712 --> 27:57.175
Look at our history.
I mean, look at the things we've built.

27:57.507 --> 27:59.500
We belong here.

27:59.876 --> 28:01.544
We wouldn't even have to
live alongside humans.

28:01.631 --> 28:04.624
We could just find a remote
place like this and start afresh.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.550
There's room for all of us.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.449
You know, the nearest humans
to this place are days away.

28:15.359 --> 28:17.324
We could bring Vikka back.

28:18.183 --> 28:19.363
No.

28:21.246 --> 28:22.536
Worth a try.

28:34.032 --> 28:36.145
Okay, I want you
to get out there

28:36.316 --> 28:38.777
and scale down that wall.

28:39.123 --> 28:41.871
Scale down? But, Mom,
I'm afraid of heights.

28:41.959 --> 28:44.290
Well, have you got another way
of getting out of here?

28:44.378 --> 28:46.191
Yeah. The mines.

28:46.279 --> 28:48.126
They stretch out
way out there,

28:48.214 --> 28:49.668
probably right out
to those tents.

28:49.901 --> 28:51.665
And then what?
What, are you gonna...

28:51.753 --> 28:55.347
You gonna dig your way
out of there, are you?

28:55.602 --> 28:57.394
- But, Mom.
- But nothing!

28:57.525 --> 29:00.712
You go and get those cute
peaches of yours down that wall.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.730
Get over that wall now!

29:03.272 --> 29:04.832
- Yes, Mom.
- Bye-bye.

29:05.394 --> 29:07.011
Gods, give me strength.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.441
<i>( Music playing )</i>

29:29.834 --> 29:31.377
Shoo! Shoo!

29:31.622 --> 29:33.092
( Groaning )

29:34.331 --> 29:35.660
Now what?

29:39.746 --> 29:41.293
Ah.

29:45.667 --> 29:48.009
- From the Mistress.
- She sent two?

29:48.167 --> 29:50.910
Yes, you got
a whole army to feed.

29:55.505 --> 29:57.964
Be sure to thank
the Mistress for me.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.618
( Snoring )

30:32.542 --> 30:35.665
( clattering )

30:36.557 --> 30:37.997
( groaning )

31:19.392 --> 31:21.032
( snoring )

31:25.713 --> 31:26.866
Hey!

31:30.002 --> 31:32.025
If muscle boy
weren't so stupid,

31:32.112 --> 31:33.872
he would be out of here
if it were up to you.

31:33.994 --> 31:35.665
Garret:
Oh, please.

31:35.832 --> 31:37.825
That lazy pig
could never stop me.

31:37.912 --> 31:39.542
And who are you calling stupid?

31:39.630 --> 31:41.574
And who are you
calling a lazy pig?

31:43.581 --> 31:46.995
That's a pretty clever trick,
isn't it? Only one problem.

31:47.082 --> 31:50.909
Linen garments are no match
for steel bars.

31:53.706 --> 31:55.964
I will get out of here,
Janzo.

31:56.097 --> 31:58.960
And when I do,
you will pay for this abuse.

31:59.142 --> 32:00.365
( Scoffs )

32:00.452 --> 32:01.816
Abuse?

32:02.433 --> 32:04.042
I'm trying to save
your life, Garret.

32:05.193 --> 32:07.995
You stay like this, Gwynn'll...
Gwynn'll have your head.

32:08.652 --> 32:11.105
Not if I take hers first.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.605
What?

32:30.759 --> 32:32.722
Maybe you're not
so stupid after all.

32:33.043 --> 32:35.433
Is this the belt
you were trying to reach?

32:39.081 --> 32:40.164
Or is it this that you were

32:40.252 --> 32:42.831
so desperately
trying to reach, huh?

32:43.276 --> 32:44.956
Give me that.
Give that here.

32:45.044 --> 32:46.707
That's mine.
That's my medicine.

32:46.795 --> 32:48.968
Have you been taking this
every day, Garret?

32:49.200 --> 32:51.563
I need it, Janzo.
Just give it to me.

32:51.651 --> 32:53.324
Fascinating, isn't it?

32:59.458 --> 33:01.041
I know that taste.

33:01.301 --> 33:03.261
Why have you been
taking this?

33:03.722 --> 33:05.488
When I was ambushed by Dred,

33:05.678 --> 33:08.980
I was wounded, nearly dead.

33:09.351 --> 33:11.956
And in the Capital,
they gave me that to heal me.

33:12.044 --> 33:14.402
Now I can't live without it,

33:14.490 --> 33:16.488
so please,
just give it to me, Janzo.

33:16.576 --> 33:17.902
- Nyassa root.
- What?

33:17.990 --> 33:20.394
That's what this is.
Nyassa root.

33:21.414 --> 33:23.087
When they were healing you,

33:23.175 --> 33:25.058
did they give you
large quantities of it?

33:25.146 --> 33:27.129
A whole mouthful?
Did it make you go to sleep?

33:27.253 --> 33:28.777
It took away the pain.

33:30.637 --> 33:31.722
Here it is.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.128
"Nyassa root.
Used for alleviation of pain

33:35.232 --> 33:36.222
and as a sleep aid.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.769
In high concentrations,

33:37.899 --> 33:39.277
patients become compliant

33:39.365 --> 33:41.425
and susceptible to suggestion.

33:41.513 --> 33:43.716
Effects can last weeks."

33:43.804 --> 33:46.066
No! No! I need that!

33:46.173 --> 33:48.175
It's actually the last thing
you need right now.

33:48.297 --> 33:52.060
Sana said I have to take that
or I will get sick again,

33:52.403 --> 33:54.626
- maybe even die!
- Beautiful.

33:54.714 --> 33:55.997
I don't know who this Sana is,

33:56.085 --> 33:57.544
but I'm assuming
it's the same person

33:57.632 --> 33:59.677
who told you all of this
nonsense about Gwynn.

33:59.765 --> 34:02.341
There was proof, Janzo.
Undeniable proof.

34:02.429 --> 34:05.544
This root, my dear boy, is the same
thing that makes your mind pliable,

34:05.632 --> 34:07.966
and it allows them to feed
all these lies into it.

34:08.054 --> 34:10.138
- It's medicine.
- Oh, it's medicine, all right.

34:10.226 --> 34:12.429
The type of medicine
the Prime Order will give you

34:12.516 --> 34:13.888
to turn you
against your friends,

34:13.976 --> 34:15.404
and also make you come here

34:15.492 --> 34:17.966
- and do their dirty work for them.
- That's not true!

34:19.565 --> 34:21.449
- Take this.
- No.

34:22.137 --> 34:24.777
Once it kicks in,
or once the Nyassa root

34:24.864 --> 34:26.529
works its way out
of your system,

34:26.679 --> 34:28.612
maybe you'll start
thinking more clearly.

34:28.746 --> 34:31.052
Maybe you'll start remembering
who your real friends are.

34:40.021 --> 34:41.360
Yes.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.029
And I forgive you,
by the way.

34:45.331 --> 34:48.286
Can't hold someone responsible
who's been drugged.

34:50.992 --> 34:51.992
Drink up.

35:20.847 --> 35:22.888
These were the humans
who took me in.

35:27.397 --> 35:29.157
My adopted family.

35:33.654 --> 35:35.407
All they ever did
was show me kindness,

35:35.495 --> 35:37.568
and a Blackblood murdered them
in cold blood.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.427
Zed: I'm sorry, Talon.

35:39.962 --> 35:41.607
Varlek always was a monster,

35:41.733 --> 35:43.919
even before
we were sent away,

35:44.824 --> 35:47.122
him and the rest
of the Black Fist.

35:56.649 --> 35:58.092
And if this was you,

35:58.180 --> 36:00.303
would you have murdered
these humans?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.693
I'd hope you know me
better than that, Talon.

36:02.959 --> 36:05.392
Most of the Blackbloods
don't support the Fist

36:05.480 --> 36:07.060
or their methods.

36:09.130 --> 36:11.060
You don't seem
to exactly love humans.

36:11.186 --> 36:14.575
I don't. I hate them for
locking us away from this world,

36:14.663 --> 36:18.021
and I hate them for imprisoning
us in the Plane of Ashes.

36:18.706 --> 36:20.155
But that doesn't mean
I want to kill them.

36:20.242 --> 36:21.280
You hate them for something

36:21.367 --> 36:23.286
their ancestors did
before they were born.

36:23.427 --> 36:25.708
And they hate you
because they fear you.

36:26.111 --> 36:28.685
Then you must help
both of our sides.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.200
You'll save us.

36:33.450 --> 36:34.997
You're the One.

36:36.671 --> 36:39.950
- Let's just get the gem and go.
- All right.

36:40.536 --> 36:42.138
Which one is Varlek?

37:00.874 --> 37:03.906
<i>( Music playing )</i>

37:27.323 --> 37:28.828
Give me the necklace.

37:50.711 --> 37:52.757
What's it doing?

37:53.541 --> 37:55.331
I have no idea.

38:00.216 --> 38:01.968
( Knocking on door )

38:02.693 --> 38:04.283
Come.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.030
( Door opens )

38:11.570 --> 38:14.249
Probably a good day
to take up drinking again.

38:14.695 --> 38:16.614
Actually,
it's just grape juice.

38:16.702 --> 38:17.892
Unfermented.

38:18.171 --> 38:20.031
The merchant said
it was very good.

38:20.234 --> 38:21.890
Two cups, please.

38:26.546 --> 38:28.788
So what did Milus offer you
to betray me?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.005
You think I somehow
betrayed you?

38:32.187 --> 38:33.624
No.

38:34.311 --> 38:35.585
No, I don't think you would,

38:35.673 --> 38:38.390
but I'm certain that
he would try to persuade you,

38:38.478 --> 38:41.312
so what did he offer?

38:42.257 --> 38:44.012
He offered me my lands back

38:44.242 --> 38:46.577
and to serve
as governor under him.

38:46.742 --> 38:47.923
Hmm.

38:48.265 --> 38:51.460
Well, sounds pretty good.

38:54.124 --> 38:57.702
And, um, well, what's...
What's stopping you?

39:00.030 --> 39:02.398
Well, maybe my plan

39:03.327 --> 39:05.726
is to poison you with this...

39:10.373 --> 39:12.162
...extremely sour grape juice.

39:12.663 --> 39:15.303
These bloody merchants.

39:15.390 --> 39:17.663
( Sighs )

39:18.038 --> 39:20.781
Despite everything
that's happened, um,

39:20.890 --> 39:24.890
the truth is
I still care about your well-being.

39:26.384 --> 39:29.437
Despite my stupidity
on our wedding day?

39:29.726 --> 39:32.614
Wedding day?
You'll have to excuse me.

39:32.702 --> 39:34.906
I've sustained some
very serious injuries.

39:35.085 --> 39:37.523
I can't recall
of any wedding day,

39:37.611 --> 39:39.945
much less anything
that happened on such a day.

39:40.148 --> 39:43.562
Hmm. Is that so?

39:43.992 --> 39:45.380
That is so.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.952
You may go.

40:11.281 --> 40:13.117
They bought both batches?

40:14.116 --> 40:15.862
Sure did, Mom.

40:16.382 --> 40:19.695
Their whole camp
will be using colipsum soon.

40:23.109 --> 40:24.853
I'm a damn genius.

40:25.562 --> 40:28.340
( Snoring )

40:32.660 --> 40:33.921
Hey, Lomack!

40:34.178 --> 40:36.265
Give me a blanket.
It's cold.

40:36.873 --> 40:40.195
Hey, pig face,
I'm talking to you.

40:40.359 --> 40:43.163
I heard you. Shut up.

40:43.772 --> 40:46.031
You lazy sack of dung.

40:46.302 --> 40:48.294
If I was still commander
of this Outpost,

40:48.382 --> 40:50.882
you'd be flogged
for dereliction of duty.

40:51.023 --> 40:53.583
But you're not
a base commander, are you?

40:53.671 --> 40:55.553
So I don't have to take
your crap anymore.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.036
You're not fit to wear that
uniform, you lazy bastard.

40:59.710 --> 41:02.323
That's it.

41:02.976 --> 41:06.300
I wanted to do this since
the day you took command,

41:06.410 --> 41:11.398
and now you're gonna wish
you kept your big mouth shut!

41:18.330 --> 41:19.850
Nope. Not yet, Lomack.

41:24.100 --> 41:28.360
Oh, Lomack, always so angry.

41:40.530 --> 41:43.943
If you don't mind,
I have a job to finish.
