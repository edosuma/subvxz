WEBVTT

00:03.161 --> 00:05.420
( Chanting )
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

00:05.456 --> 00:07.347
Yes, we can.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.967
KELLER: Yes, we can.

00:10.002 --> 00:12.861
Starting with giving money
to this can.

00:12.896 --> 00:16.098
I'm talking paper, people.

00:16.133 --> 00:19.251
KC, can I have a word with you?

00:19.286 --> 00:20.936
Uh, sure, but why just one word?

00:20.971 --> 00:22.620
You can use all your words.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.923
Except for juicy.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.352
Something about that word
just kinda grosses me out.

00:26.376 --> 00:28.418
Juicy.

00:28.453 --> 00:31.413
Well, I have
an important job for you,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.334
but I need to know you're
totally committed to the cause.

00:33.358 --> 00:36.218
Keller, I switched to
one-ply toilet paper for you.

00:36.253 --> 00:39.037
I think we both know
I'm committed.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.364
Good, because you'd be
perfect for this.

00:41.399 --> 00:44.567
You can think on your feet,
you're a master of disguise,

00:44.603 --> 00:48.054
and you're not afraid
to get your hands dirty.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.610
I just have one question
about the job.

00:51.026 --> 00:52.346
How soon can I get
my hands dirty?

00:57.482 --> 01:00.909
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:00.944 --> 01:04.104
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:04.181 --> 01:07.357
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:07.392 --> 01:12.161
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:12.197 --> 01:15.865
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:15.900 --> 01:17.959
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:17.995 --> 01:22.030
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:22.065 --> 01:25.967
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:26.003 --> 01:28.244
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

01:28.279 --> 01:30.230
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

01:30.265 --> 01:32.665
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

01:32.701 --> 01:34.818
¶ But I always got your back ¶

01:34.853 --> 01:36.662
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

01:36.697 --> 01:38.905
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

01:38.940 --> 01:41.583
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

01:41.618 --> 01:42.653
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

01:42.677 --> 01:45.045
I keep it undercover.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
I keep it undercover.

01:49.893 --> 01:52.194
Ernie, enough already.

01:52.229 --> 01:55.205
I'm telling you, Dad,
KC's in too deep.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.941
This is more than just
tofu-loving, incense-burning

01:58.977 --> 02:01.211
macram-making good times.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.266
Keller's gotten into her head,
and we've gotta get her out.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.884
Ernie, this is all just
part of her assignment.

02:04.908 --> 02:07.700
No, Dad, she's changed.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.078
I went to see her the other day,

02:10.114 --> 02:13.715
and she stopped using deodorant

02:13.751 --> 02:16.311
due to its harmful interaction
with the body's natural chemistry.

02:17.863 --> 02:20.122
They've broken her, Dad.
They've broken her!

02:20.157 --> 02:23.183
( Sniffing )
Did they break you, too?

02:23.218 --> 02:25.643
Ernie, KC's just working Keller.

02:25.679 --> 02:29.797
It's all a mind game. You know
what mind games are, don't you?

02:29.833 --> 02:32.325
Like the way you sometimes
put me down and embarrass me

02:32.361 --> 02:33.810
in order to make me stronger?

02:33.845 --> 02:35.779
Yeah, like that.

02:35.814 --> 02:38.423
Well, I'm telling you.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.842
KC's under Keller's control.

02:40.877 --> 02:43.395
Ernie, trust me. KC's fine.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.722
She knows when working
deep cover,

02:45.757 --> 02:49.442
a good agent can never
show a crack in the armor.

02:49.478 --> 02:51.269
Now promise me you're not
gonna do anything.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.805
Fine. I promise
I won't do anything.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.457
- Ernie.
- I said I promise.

02:57.919 --> 02:59.970
Hey, Ernie, where's KC?

03:00.005 --> 03:02.347
She's a Volunteen
under Keller's control.

03:02.424 --> 03:04.384
I'm going rogue, and I need
your help to save her.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.105
This is a great time
we're living in.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.806
The country of Monrovia
is transitioning

03:11.842 --> 03:14.650
from a monarchy to a democracy.

03:14.686 --> 03:18.296
The queen will no longer parade
around her 40-karat diamond

03:18.331 --> 03:20.707
while her people
eat dirt for lunch.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.342
Forty karats? Dang.

03:22.377 --> 03:24.302
Step aside, Dwayne Johnson.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.146
There's a new rock in town.

03:27.182 --> 03:30.149
But there are loyalists
who stand in the way of change.

03:30.185 --> 03:32.544
That's why you'll be capturing
the Monrovian ambassador

03:32.579 --> 03:34.103
and bringing him to me.

03:34.139 --> 03:36.055
Just capture him?

03:36.091 --> 03:38.450
'Cause I can do so much more.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.135
I can rough him up a little bit.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.970
Pull out his arm hairs,

03:42.005 --> 03:43.041
eat some sardines
and close-talk him.

03:43.065 --> 03:44.848
Nobody likes that.

03:44.883 --> 03:47.626
No, just bring him back here.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.253
Are you sure,
because I can give him

03:50.289 --> 03:53.373
a real nasty paper cut
right in the thumb web.

03:53.408 --> 03:55.016
You know, when you think
it's healed,

03:55.052 --> 03:56.969
then you go to
reach for something,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.354
and it pops right back
open again.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.131
No.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.233
But you didn't
let me finish, girl.

04:03.268 --> 04:05.502
Then you put a little
lemon juice on it.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.512
Really not necessary.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.238
Okay, okay, okay.

04:09.274 --> 04:10.301
We'll just go with the classic.

04:10.325 --> 04:12.792
- Wet Willie.
- No.

04:12.827 --> 04:15.603
- Dry Willie.
- No!

04:15.638 --> 04:17.839
Just bring him back here.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.949
Okay, okay.

04:19.985 --> 04:21.785
Fine, if you wanna take
all the fun out of it.

04:26.508 --> 04:28.202
Okay, I think if we're gonna
get KC out of there,

04:28.226 --> 04:30.484
what we need to do...

04:30.520 --> 04:32.963
Bup-bup-bup. Marisa, please.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.698
I am the experienced agent.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.645
I have been on many missions,
and I know what I'm doing.

04:37.669 --> 04:39.811
So your fly is down on purpose?

04:42.582 --> 04:44.307
Look, I think what
we need to do...

04:44.342 --> 04:45.908
You don't need to think.

04:45.944 --> 04:49.295
Just listen.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.974
You're gonna go undercover as
Nadine Klansky,

04:53.009 --> 04:55.577
a disgruntled teenager
who didn't make the cut

04:55.612 --> 04:57.687
for the U.S. Olympic
figure skating team

04:57.722 --> 04:59.840
because of a mediocre
triple axel.

04:59.916 --> 05:03.118
You see, in this "everyone
gets a trophy" society,

05:03.153 --> 05:05.403
her parents built her up
to believe

05:05.438 --> 05:07.563
she could accomplish anything,
but in reality,

05:07.599 --> 05:11.559
Nadine couldn't make ice,
much less skate on it.

05:11.594 --> 05:15.564
Is this going anywhere?

05:15.640 --> 05:18.717
Yes, but you won't be
unless you pay attention.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.376
Now stick with me.

05:20.411 --> 05:24.072
Once Nadine realized
her mediocrity,

05:24.149 --> 05:26.416
she shunned her upper-lower
middle class family,

05:26.452 --> 05:28.743
and fled her home on
a sun-drenched cul-de-sac

05:28.778 --> 05:31.037
of Dayton, Ohio,
and came to D.C.

05:31.072 --> 05:33.014
to become a Volunteen.

05:33.049 --> 05:35.258
Okay, I can see that you put

05:35.294 --> 05:38.861
a lot of thought
and effort into this,

05:38.897 --> 05:41.206
which is just heartbreaking
because it is so stupid.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.985
Look, since they don't know
anything about me,

05:46.020 --> 05:47.621
I can just go in as myself.

05:47.656 --> 05:50.465
Excuse me? I am in charge.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.543
Now...

05:53.579 --> 05:56.246
I'm thinking, since they don't
know anything about you,

05:56.281 --> 05:57.391
you should just go in
as yourself.

05:57.415 --> 05:59.332
Great.

05:59.367 --> 06:02.102
Now let's work on
your backstory.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.057
And your front story.
Why is your fly down again?

06:14.057 --> 06:16.108
All right, Keller,
I'm in position.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.751
Be careful.
Nothing can go wrong.

06:17.786 --> 06:20.403
- I need the ambassador.
- <i>Okay, please.</i>

06:20.438 --> 06:22.530
Relax, okay.
I think I can handle

06:22.566 --> 06:24.806
whatever doughnut-loving
mall cop they have guarding him.

06:31.575 --> 06:34.467
Well, got the doughnut-loving
part right.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.701
I can't even look
out the window?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.747
Aren't you being
a little overprotective?

06:44.771 --> 06:48.089
A lot of people call me
overprotective, but you know what?

06:48.124 --> 06:49.607
Those people are still alive.

06:51.519 --> 06:53.199
Well, most of those people
are still alive.

06:57.601 --> 06:59.241
I still think you're
being overprotective.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.214
Don't just stand there, Greg.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.748
Overprotect me! Overprotect me!

07:23.677 --> 07:25.985
You.

07:26.021 --> 07:27.445
Over here now.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.013
And do anything stupid.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.733
- Like what?
- Like ask, "Why am I hitting the floor?"

07:36.623 --> 07:38.665
Sorry, Dad,
but like you taught me,

07:38.700 --> 07:40.575
no cracks in the armor.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.543
Did someone order
a Monrovian ambassador?

07:49.578 --> 07:51.336
In a to-go bag?

07:53.248 --> 07:55.348
Nicely done, KC.

07:55.383 --> 07:57.934
I knew I could count on you.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.213
Of course you can.
So, what do we do with him now?

07:59.237 --> 08:01.262
Your job is done.

08:01.298 --> 08:03.598
Leave me alone with him.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.309
I'll get the information I need,
one way or another.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.538
Well, I'm glad we took
bodily harm off the table.

08:16.346 --> 08:18.405
It is still off
the table, right?

08:18.440 --> 08:21.207
Go.

08:21.242 --> 08:23.818
Uh, yeah, no.
For sure. You know what.

08:23.853 --> 08:25.578
You do what you gotta do.

08:27.081 --> 08:29.707
Although, you know...

08:29.742 --> 08:32.193
I really don't have
anything else to do,

08:32.228 --> 08:34.504
so I could just
chill here, you know.

08:34.539 --> 08:36.431
Help out, maybe be here
for moral support.

08:36.466 --> 08:38.841
You know what? What I should do

08:38.876 --> 08:41.469
is take a little seat
and watch quietly.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.865
KC, you're not listening.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.151
I told you to go. Now go.

08:48.186 --> 08:50.837
For sure. I'll go.

08:50.872 --> 08:52.839
Hit the bricks. Skedaddle.

08:52.874 --> 08:55.567
Make like a bread truck
and haul buns.

08:58.755 --> 08:59.755
You're still here.

09:01.525 --> 09:03.758
Oh, am I? I sure am.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.778
True dat, true dat.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.339
Uh, but, uh,
I'll be leaving now.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.483
Keep the door open.
You got a boy in your room.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.545
- KC!
- Going.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.222
Hey, did you call me?

09:18.258 --> 09:19.258
No!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.031
Okay, I have a suggestion.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.516
You know that thing
where we chant,

09:28.552 --> 09:31.252
"What do we want? A revolution.

09:31.287 --> 09:32.962
When do we want it, now."

09:32.997 --> 09:35.273
What if we changed that to,

09:35.309 --> 09:36.983
"What do we want? A revolution."

09:37.018 --> 09:38.910
When do we want it?
Not on a Friday night,

09:38.945 --> 09:40.505
"because some of us
already have plans."

09:43.333 --> 09:44.624
KELLER:<i> Namaste, everyone.</i>

09:44.659 --> 09:47.027
<i>Yoga class is now beginning.</i>

09:47.062 --> 09:49.462
You guys go ahead.
I can't do yoga.

09:49.497 --> 09:51.573
Nadine Klansky has a bum hip.

09:51.608 --> 09:54.751
Just an old
figure skating injury.

09:54.786 --> 09:56.122
I landed that triple axel
at the world nationals,

09:56.146 --> 09:57.587
but at what cost?

09:57.622 --> 09:59.047
At what cost?!

10:10.418 --> 10:12.410
Whoo, it's drafty.
Drafty in here.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.779
( Ernie screaming )

10:14.814 --> 10:16.672
Yeah. Ooh, that wind.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.733
It's just howling.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.691
Come on.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.134
Come on.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.637
First of all... ow!

10:31.673 --> 10:34.598
Second of all,
what took you so long?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.392
I've been waiting
outside for an hour.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.361
What are you complaining about?

10:38.396 --> 10:40.646
They made me drink kombucha.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.232
It is fermented tea
with slimy mushrooms

10:43.267 --> 10:47.145
made from live bacteria and no, no,
it is not as good as it sounds.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.805
All right, you did your job.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.974
The professional will
take it from here.

10:52.009 --> 10:54.029
And you'll take me with you.
I really wanna help KC.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.614
- Fine. You can be back-up.
- What does back-up do?

10:57.649 --> 10:59.169
You can back up
out that door. Bye-bye.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.937
All right, I'm here.

11:04.972 --> 11:07.432
What is it, Craig?

11:07.467 --> 11:10.326
Well, you know that ambassador
I was watching,

11:10.361 --> 11:12.320
my friend who specifically
requested me,

11:12.355 --> 11:13.796
'cause I'm charming,
I'm likable.

11:13.831 --> 11:15.614
I always do a great job.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.608
And, who I might add,
I already saved once

11:17.644 --> 11:20.545
from certain death in a potentially
lethal elliptical bombing.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.748
- What's your point, Craig?
- Somebody knocked me out and took him.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.850
Don't worry, don't worry.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.435
- I can find him.
- No need.

11:27.470 --> 11:28.519
We think we found him.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.588
We won't know for sure

11:30.623 --> 11:32.924
until the dental records
come back.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.475
Does this look like your friend?

11:38.481 --> 11:40.147
REPORTER:
<i>Following the explosion,</i>

11:40.182 --> 11:42.609
<i>firefighters
extinguished the car.</i>

11:42.644 --> 11:44.986
<i>The deceased is believed to be
Ambassador Armad Rollin,</i>

11:45.021 --> 11:47.205
<i>from the newly liberated
republic of Monrovia.</i>

11:47.240 --> 11:49.273
Wait, Rollin is gone?

11:49.309 --> 11:51.367
You never said you were
gonna eliminate him.

11:51.402 --> 11:53.903
Well, the ambassador and I
had a little chat.

11:53.938 --> 11:57.407
And agreed I was
better off dead.

11:57.442 --> 11:59.041
All right,
something stinks here,

11:59.076 --> 12:01.043
and it's obviously
not your rotting corpse.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.797
What is going on?

12:07.202 --> 12:08.805
Miss Keller and I are going
into business together.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.821
The ambassador can access
the entire Monrovian treasury.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.383
And now that everyone
thinks I'm dead,

12:15.418 --> 12:17.685
I can transfer a billion dollars

12:17.721 --> 12:19.237
into Keller's
untraceable account.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.064
Then you two split the money,
and start new lives.

12:23.668 --> 12:25.902
Mm-mm-mm. Sha-dy.

12:28.272 --> 12:29.675
I knew all along
you were no good, Keller,

12:29.699 --> 12:31.081
but for a second there,

12:31.117 --> 12:34.760
I thought you actually wanted to
make the world a better place.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.916
With all your speeches and
getting your little Oprah on.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.482
I did care about
making this a better world,

12:39.517 --> 12:42.176
at first, then I realized...

12:42.211 --> 12:45.020
that's a lot of work.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.116
A funny thing about money, KC.

12:48.151 --> 12:49.878
Turns out, the more you have,
the less you care about

12:49.902 --> 12:52.253
other people not having it.

12:52.289 --> 12:54.647
I'm starting to understand
why the queen of Monrovia

12:54.724 --> 12:57.592
clung so tightly to
that 40-karat diamond of hers.

12:57.627 --> 12:59.836
Okay. Well, you know what?

12:59.871 --> 13:01.273
Let me just be the first
to wish you good luck

13:01.297 --> 13:03.156
with your new life... in prison.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.783
I hope you like dropping
a deuce with an audience.

13:05.818 --> 13:08.995
Yeah, I don't think so.

13:09.072 --> 13:11.372
I have been waiting
to take you down, sweetheart.

13:11.449 --> 13:14.542
I have been trained in
17 forms of martial arts,

13:14.577 --> 13:16.444
and I'm an avid fan
of pro wrestling.

13:16.479 --> 13:17.987
I will take you two down
so quick,

13:18.022 --> 13:20.739
you won't even know
what hit you.

13:20.775 --> 13:22.455
Hint: It'll probably be
that folding chair.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.914
KC, I'm here to save you.

13:27.949 --> 13:30.375
( Gasps ) You monster.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.843
What have you done to my sister?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.351
You can run and hide, but
the Organization will find you.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.436
I don't see how,

13:42.471 --> 13:43.874
when all the evidence
will be destroyed.

13:43.898 --> 13:46.532
I don't think so.
There's a paper trail,

13:46.567 --> 13:48.551
and it all leads back to you.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.461
You know the best thing
about paper?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.279
It changed humanity by
enabling people

13:52.315 --> 13:53.555
to record their oral histories.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.883
Well, there's that.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.911
But I was thinking
it's so easy to get rid of.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.957
I can't believe it.

14:02.992 --> 14:04.608
I can't believe she got
the better of me.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.435
Paper's easy to get rid of?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.631
What's that supposed to mean?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.492
Uh, Ernie, I think...

14:13.527 --> 14:15.895
KC, I'm trying
to figure this out.

14:15.931 --> 14:18.046
( Coughing )

14:18.082 --> 14:20.274
Keller must be planning
to shred the evidence.

14:20.309 --> 14:22.676
No, Ernie, seriously...

14:22.712 --> 14:25.012
When we get out of here,
you should really see a doctor.

14:25.048 --> 14:26.249
I think you're
coming down with something.

14:26.273 --> 14:28.582
- Ernie...
- Wait!

14:28.618 --> 14:31.369
( Sniffing ) I smell smoke.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.737
Maybe they're bringing us
some barbecue.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.390
No, dummy, we're the barbecue.

14:36.426 --> 14:39.535
- Help!
- Help!

14:39.570 --> 14:41.370
Help, somebody!

14:45.518 --> 14:47.835
( Both coughing )

14:47.871 --> 14:50.471
We don't have much time left.

14:50.506 --> 14:52.631
We should make the most of it.

14:52.666 --> 14:55.300
Go ahead,
before it's too late, thank me.

14:55.336 --> 14:56.936
Thank you? For what?

14:56.971 --> 14:58.562
Coming to rescue you.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.915
We are tied up in a room

15:00.950 --> 15:02.850
that is quickly
running out of oxygen.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.238
You want me to use
what little I have left

15:04.262 --> 15:05.611
to thank you?

15:05.646 --> 15:06.646
It wouldn't kill you.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.940
Actually, yes, it could.

15:10.835 --> 15:12.384
I don't think
I like your attitude.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.305
Don't expect me to rescue you again
any time in the near future.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.220
What future? We're about
to become people jerky.

15:28.044 --> 15:29.886
BOTH: Dad?!

15:29.921 --> 15:33.348
Yes, Dad. Why do you look
all surprised?

15:33.424 --> 15:37.927
For your information,
I happen to be a top spy.

15:37.962 --> 15:40.605
Busting in and saving people
happens to be my thing.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.624
Take notes, Ernie.
See how we're both conscious?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.834
That is a rescue.

15:45.870 --> 15:48.905
How did you find us?

15:48.940 --> 15:50.982
I knew it was you
who took the ambassador.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.751
I was wearing a ski mask.
How did you know it was me?

15:53.787 --> 15:56.028
( Gasps ) Because Dad
must have X-ray vision!

15:58.241 --> 16:01.375
Dad, no one would fault you
if you only untied me.

16:01.410 --> 16:04.604
I knew because you took me out

16:04.639 --> 16:07.139
with the legendary
double punch crunch kick.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.175
What's the legendary
double punch crunch kick?

16:09.210 --> 16:12.586
It's Dad's secret fighting move.
He taught it to me.

16:12.621 --> 16:17.133
It's a father-daughter
dance of destruction.

16:17.168 --> 16:19.029
And I never saw it coming because
no one but the two of us know it.

16:19.053 --> 16:20.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.647
You taught KC
your secret punch kick,

16:23.682 --> 16:25.717
but you didn't teach me?

16:25.752 --> 16:26.962
Do you know how hurtful that is?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.352
I do now. I can
barely feel my jaw.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.457
Oh, boy, come on.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.877
It's just mind games.
It'll make you stronger.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.289
Aw, thank you, Dad.
You're the best.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.283
That's my boy. That boy
will believe anything.

16:45.972 --> 16:49.231
I had her.

16:49.266 --> 16:51.759
I had Keller right in
my hands, and I lost her.

16:51.794 --> 16:53.436
What a complete failure.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.364
You get used to it.

16:56.399 --> 16:59.183
KC, I don't know
if Ernie mentioned this to you,

16:59.185 --> 17:01.702
but I was a crucial member
of the rescue mission.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.513
I mean, my execution
was flawless.

17:03.548 --> 17:05.590
Not one misstep.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.325
You slammed a window on my hand.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.241
I did what I had to do,
and I would do it again.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.941
And by the way,
spies don't brag.

17:15.977 --> 17:17.910
It's a good thing I'm not a spy,

17:17.945 --> 17:19.412
because I was ¶ amazing ¶

17:19.447 --> 17:22.957
And the worst part is,
I can't even track Keller down.

17:22.992 --> 17:24.450
She's completely off the grid.

17:24.485 --> 17:26.143
KC, let it go.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.070
Take your mind off of it.

17:28.105 --> 17:29.546
Just concentrate on
the card game.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.332
Okay, fine.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.266
Three of a kind.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.960
We're playing Crazy Eights.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.380
Right. I knew that.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.178
Changing that to diamonds.

17:44.213 --> 17:45.488
Diamonds. Right.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.123
Diamonds.

17:48.158 --> 17:49.717
Diamonds! Guys,
that is it. Diamonds.

17:49.752 --> 17:53.688
Yes. And now, it's hearts.

17:53.723 --> 17:56.039
No, diamonds.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.576
Keller would not shut up
about diamonds.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.244
It was like
she was obsessed with it.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.813
At least, this 40-karat one.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.467
Ernie, look up
the Monrovian royal diamond.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.585
All right.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.312
Here it is.

18:10.348 --> 18:12.864
Ooh, look at this.

18:12.900 --> 18:16.819
"The Monrovian monarchy
has been phased out.

18:16.854 --> 18:19.104
The auction will be held..."

18:19.140 --> 18:21.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yada, yada, yada.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.450
"Royal treasures, pieces of art.

18:23.485 --> 18:25.086
Furniture dating back to..."

18:25.121 --> 18:27.037
Ha! Here it is.
Okay, I found it.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.615
The famous Monrovian
royal diamond.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.451
Guys, I gotta get to
that auction in Monrovia.

18:36.374 --> 18:37.981
( Gavel pounding )

18:38.017 --> 18:40.009
We will now begin the bidding

18:40.044 --> 18:43.003
on our next item,
lot number 975,

18:43.039 --> 18:45.948
the 40-karat Monrovian
royal diamond.

18:48.352 --> 18:50.378
This one-of-a-kind stone,

18:50.454 --> 18:53.722
one of the largest
flawless diamonds in the world,

18:53.758 --> 18:55.983
had been the property
of the recently deposed

18:56.019 --> 18:58.427
queen of Monrovia.

18:58.462 --> 19:00.630
We will start the bidding
at $5 million.

19:00.665 --> 19:03.357
Five million.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.301
( Russian accent )
Five million and one dollar.

19:08.556 --> 19:11.039
Six million.

19:11.074 --> 19:13.684
Six million and one dollar.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.228
Seven million.

19:16.264 --> 19:18.480
Seven million and one dollar.

19:21.302 --> 19:23.135
Who is that woman?

19:23.170 --> 19:24.450
Who is that woman
and one dollar.

19:26.641 --> 19:28.799
I'm sorry. This is not
a real bid.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.676
I get what you say confuse-ski.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.387
Who are you?

19:33.423 --> 19:36.883
Not that it is
any of your business,

19:36.959 --> 19:40.177
but I am well-known
international recording artist

19:40.212 --> 19:43.063
slash platform diver
slash spokesmodel

19:43.099 --> 19:47.885
Nikita Minajka Waka Flocka
Bernstein.

19:49.596 --> 19:51.230
I've never heard of you.

19:51.265 --> 19:53.690
Well, perhaps
you know me better as...

19:53.726 --> 19:54.753
( normal voice ) Someone who
actually cares about the planet.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.227
- KC.
- Keller.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.372
That is for being phony and
almost making me believe in you.

20:20.244 --> 20:23.995
That is for taking advantage
of vulnerable teenagers.

20:24.031 --> 20:26.715
And that is for making me
cash in my miles

20:26.750 --> 20:28.959
to fly all the way over here
last minute to Monrovia.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.995
I was supposed to go
to Paris this summer,

20:31.030 --> 20:32.107
but instead, I had to sit
in the middle seat

20:32.131 --> 20:33.430
by the bathroom.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.182
Thank you.

20:44.218 --> 20:47.602
Sold to the stunningly
gorgeous teenage spy

20:47.638 --> 20:49.571
who always gets her man
or woman. Am I right?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.079
You guys can just bill that
to the Organization.

21:02.044 --> 21:03.669
Okay, that's enough of that.

21:06.574 --> 21:09.233
Ernie, what's taking
you so long?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.428
Do you wanna learn the double
punch crunch kick or not?

21:13.747 --> 21:16.106
Boy, what are you wearing?

21:16.142 --> 21:20.111
Padding. We have to make sure
we adhere to OSHA guidelines

21:20.113 --> 21:23.805
to prevent musculoskeletal
injuries in the workplace.

21:23.841 --> 21:26.650
Too late. I think someone
already injured your head.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.511
I'm serious, Dad. Safety first.

21:29.547 --> 21:31.212
Safety from what?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.923
You're throwing a punch at me.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.075
Now come on. Come on, boy.

21:35.111 --> 21:36.351
Hit me. You got this. Hit me.

21:36.387 --> 21:37.953
( Inhaling deeply )

21:41.500 --> 21:43.675
I don't think I can do it, Dad.

21:43.711 --> 21:47.037
This is why I didn't want to teach
you the move in the first place.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.233
You're too weak, you're too
soft, you're too much of...

21:53.120 --> 21:55.346
I don't think I did that right.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.722
Close enough.

22:00.469 --> 22:02.986
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
