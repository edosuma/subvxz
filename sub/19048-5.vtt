WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:05.505
[Dee] I don't know.
What do you think?

00:05.589 --> 00:09.008
It's kind of doing nothing for my hip
area and making a mess of my boobs.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.636
You know what?
Why don't you go grab five more?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.430
Look, we don't
normally do this.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.850
But I think I'm gonna need some proof
that you're actually getting married.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.852
What? Why?

00:19.937 --> 00:23.439
Because you've been coming in here and
trying on wedding dresses every Saturday...

00:23.524 --> 00:25.441
for over a year now.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.861
Yeah. That's 'cause it takes a
really long time to plan a wedding.

00:28.946 --> 00:32.573
Don't get up all over my balls, Lucy.
Just go get the dresses.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.617
When is the wedding?
Soon.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.202
Where?
A church.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.829
Which one?
The nearby one.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.414
The nearby one?
Right down the street.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.998
Which street?
Spring.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.625
What's your fiancé's name?
Sam.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.585
What does he do?
S-S-Salt.

00:44.712 --> 00:48.214
Salt? Sea... salt.
Sea salt.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.383
He's a salt seaman.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.762
He- He dives in to the ocean
for the sea salt.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.974
And then he brings it back up.
And then we eat it.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.352
So- Okay, I'm getting the manager.

01:01.437 --> 01:05.565
Well, don't get the- [Sighs] Damn it.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.485
- Dee Reynolds?
- Yeah.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.779
Brad Fisher.
From high school.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.323
Brad Fisher.
No way.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.743
Yeah.
You look amazing.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.870
Your acne cleared up
really well.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.623
I kinda grew into myself.
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.168
Why did I ever break up with you, you beefcake?
It was because of the acne.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.212
Was it because of the acne? Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, when it got real bad,

01:28.297 --> 01:32.175
you dumped me and you said it was 'cause I was
gonna grow up to look like Edward James Olmos.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.886
Well, I don't really remember
saying exactly that.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.596
It's- It's fine.
We were kids. We were kids.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.723
We were kids!
Yeah.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.183
We're not kids anymore.
No.

01:40.309 --> 01:43.603
Great. Wow. So you're-
you're getting married. Wow.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.397
Yeah. Uh, no, I'm not.
I'm not.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.400
This is because I was.
But that- that didn't work out.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.360
Why are you asking?
Are you single?

01:51.487 --> 01:53.821
What's your situation?
Um, I'm engaged.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.948
Oh. Yeah.
I mean, that's why I'm here.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.618
My fiancée's trying on a dress.
I know I'm not supposed to see it before the wedding.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.412
But we're having a whole
nontraditional kinda small thing.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.414
So you should meet her. Babe.
Well, nah...

02:03.540 --> 02:05.625
- [Woman] Yeah? - Come here for a second.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

02:05.751 --> 02:09.544
What do you think of this one, Brad?
It's beautiful, yeah.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.089
Oh, my God.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.711
[Buzzing] [Mac] Okay.
All right.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.089
Well, don't poke at it.
Don't just poke...

02:53.215 --> 02:55.591
Just get it safely into the box.
Dude, you're gonna agitate the bees.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.262
Well, I'm fine with the bees.
It's the honey I don't want to agitate.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.347
Is that your endgame
here? Honey?

03:01.431 --> 03:04.267
Yeah. I figure if we keep the hive in
the basement, we'll always have honey.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.269
[Buzzing] We'll always have
bees is what we'll always have.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.229
Whoa!
What? What?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.273
I think I just saw a wasp.
I think that was a wasp.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.899
You see that? Looked like a wasp.
Didn't look like a bee.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.317
Is this a wasp nest?
This is a wasp nest.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.986
I'm out! I'm out!
All right. Yeah, yeah.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.322
I don't want to tangle with a bunch of wasps.
Hey! Do- Do wasps make honey?

03:18.448 --> 03:21.576
[Buzzing] No.
Wasps do not make honey.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.369
All right. Well, I'm gonna
check it out anyway.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.622
There could be something delicious in
here that wasps do make, and I want that.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.126
Mac, Dennis, can I talk to you
in the office, please?

03:30.252 --> 03:32.336
Why can't we just talk right here?
Yeah?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.339
Because it's private. Ah, that sounds
like a whole thing. I'm not into it.

03:35.424 --> 03:39.176
- Mmm.
- [Screaming] Shit!

03:39.261 --> 03:41.804
I just got stung! That was a hornet!
This is a hornets nest!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.348
Uh, you know what, guys?
Why don't we step in the back office...

03:44.433 --> 03:46.934
while Charlie deals with this
whole hornet/wasp situation?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.269
Yeah.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.355
Oh. Oh, I'm a bad boy?
I'm a bad boy?

03:51.440 --> 03:55.902
Put some vegetable oil on it.
That'll make you feel better. Okay. Bye, sexy.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.614
Ohh. Who was that?

03:59.698 --> 04:03.075
That's my booty call.
We're into some really weird food fetish stuff.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.078
Gross. Okay, you guys, listen up.
We got a serious problem.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.414
The waitress is getting married.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.334
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
Artemis told me.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.503
- Since when do you talk to Artemis?
- She's my booty call.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.505
Weird.
We'll get into that later.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.507
Right now, we gotta deal
with this waitress situation.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.551
Dee, why do you give a shit that
the waitress is getting married?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.678
She's been nothing but trouble for us.
That's a good point.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.388
She doesn't seem to
get our sense of humor.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.515
We do stuff that I think's funny.
She doesn't. Hilarious!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.893
Guys! I cannot believe you're not
thinking about Charlie right now.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.604
This is gonna crush him. What?
You don't give a shit about Charlie.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.690
All you care about is the fact the waitress
is getting married before you. Right?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.568
That or she's afraid that Charlie
might blow his brains out.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.029
And then she'd have to do all the Charlie work.
Uh, that's what it is. Yeah.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.950
Okay, fine. A: I do not want to do
Charlie's work once he kills himself.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.578
B: How could the waitress get married before me?
I'm way hotter than she is.

04:47.663 --> 04:52.041
And C: Get this. The guy she's
marrying used to be my boyfriend.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.251
You know what I just realized?
I don't care about anything she's saying.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.253
Not a bit. What I do care
about is the fact that...

04:56.338 --> 04:59.298
Charlie might go postal if he finds
out about this and kill all of us.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.134
Right. Shit. We're probably the
ones at real risk here, huh?

05:02.260 --> 05:05.763
Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe we should
find something to distract him...

05:05.889 --> 05:07.932
until the whole wedding
thing blows over. Mm-hmm.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.976
- Get him his own booty call.
- Ohh!

05:10.102 --> 05:11.727
Or at least another chick to stalk.
Hey!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.729
Great. In the meantime,
I'll try and sabotage the wedding...

05:13.814 --> 05:15.731
by luring Brad away from her.
Ahh.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.192
Dee, save yourself the embarrassment.
Yeah, yeah.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.236
Let's-
Watch out for the hornets.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.572
Yeah.
Don't push me.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.201
[Knocking]

05:27.285 --> 05:29.036
[Door Opens]
Hey-oh!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.330
Hey, what's-
Ahh!

05:31.415 --> 05:32.873
What are you
doing there, buddy?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.835
I'm trying to smoke these hornets
to death so I can get their honey.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.422
They keep flying up the tube, stinging me on my face.
I think I just swallowed one.

05:39.506 --> 05:43.259
As I tried to explain before, you
cannot get honey from a hornets nest.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.720
I just don't think there's any
science to support that, buddy.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.180
There's some very basic science
out there supporting that. No.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.640
No.
Trust me, pal.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.559
It's a fact. It's not even science.
Why are you bothering...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.686
getting into it with him?
I don't know. I just feel like...

05:53.770 --> 05:55.479
Charlie, we're gonna get you
back on the dating scene, bro.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.398
What do you think about that? Yeah.
That's actually why we're here.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.983
We're gonna put your profile
on Match.com.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.569
I don't see why.
I got the waitress, guys.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.653
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.946
Sure, right.
Uh, yeah, totally.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.656
We thought maybe you could
meet somebody new. Yeah.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.033
Someone you like even more
than the waitress.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.367
I don't see
how that's possible.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.619
But I tell you what, let me
pop a quick "H" on this box.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.539
This way we all know
it's filled with the hornets.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.000
Okay? Okay, yeah.
Do what you gotta do.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.252
These things sting
like a bitch, man.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.296
First thing we gotta do is take
your picture for the profile. So...

06:20.380 --> 06:22.006
Ahh.
So, do you have the makeup?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.050
- Yeah.
- Oh, no makeup! Come on.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.552
Well, those hornet stings are pretty bad, buddy.
So I think we're gonna have to...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.846
Yeah.
But I am who I am.

06:28.972 --> 06:29.972
Right. But-
Yeah, but...

06:30.057 --> 06:31.557
Let's do who you are
minus the hornet stings.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.726
Let's pretend you're not who you are
and just try to attract a woman.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.021
I tell you what. What if I wore a checkered
hat and I smoked a pipe? That'd work.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.524
Why would you want
a checkered hat and a pipe?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.777
You know,
for the Sherlock Holmes look.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.820
Why would you want to look
like Sherlock Holmes?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.281
- Who are you trying to attract exactly?
- Intelligent women.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.492
Okay. I'm just gonna take the photo
right now without the makeup...

06:49.576 --> 06:52.244
- and see if he likes it. Ready?
- Yeah.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.915
- Ooh, that felt good.
Was that sexy? - That's very...

06:55.999 --> 06:57.416
That felt sexy.
We'll Photoshop it.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.709
Yeah, I can see
where this is going.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.252
Let's just not do that.
We'll just Photoshop it.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.879
Let's- Let's- You want
to take another one?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.924
No. No. We'll find another picture
that we can use and that'll be fine.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.676
Yeah. Let's talk about
your likes and dislikes.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.471
- How about your favorite food.
What would that be? - Oh, milk steak.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.807
Hmm?
Hmm? What?

07:12.891 --> 07:15.226
- Milk steak.
- I'm not putting milk steak.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.686
Just put steak. Just put regular steak.
And then- I'm gonna put steak.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.188
Put milk steak.
She'll know what it is.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.398
She won't know. Nobody knows what that is.
She'll know what it is.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.026
No- Okay, all right.
What's your favorite hobby?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.903
Uh, magnets.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.073
Magnets? Okay, what, like making
magnets, collecting magnets?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.616
Playing with magnets?
Just magnets.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.327
I'm gonna put snowboarding. We'll put snowboarding.
I don't really snowboard.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.330
- All right, what are some of your likes?
- Uh, ghouls.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.082
Son of a bitch.
What are you talking about now?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.876
You know, funny little
green ghouls, go- What?

07:40.961 --> 07:44.505
- What, like in movies and cartoons?
What are you- - Little green ghouls, buddy.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.632
Don't write ghouls! I'm not.
I'm putting travel.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.176
- Jesus Christ! What are your dislikes?
- People's knees.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.053
Come on! Come on! You gotta be kidding.
You know what?

07:51.179 --> 07:53.430
We'll make it up. We'll make the whole thing up.
Let's get out of here!

07:53.557 --> 07:55.266
We'll doctor the picture.
We're not even gonna use you.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.185
Cover your knees up if you're gonna
be walking around everywhere.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.482
Where are you?

08:03.567 --> 08:06.902
Come on.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.615
Bingo, bitch.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.079
- Hey!
- [Horns Honking] - Hey.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.873
You guys, how are you?
[Horns Honking]

08:18.957 --> 08:21.709
All right, calm down!
I'll be two seconds!

08:21.835 --> 08:24.378
Anyway, hi! How are you?
What are you doing?

08:24.462 --> 08:27.047
Okay, so listen up. I was thinking
since, Brad, you were saying...

08:27.174 --> 08:31.135
how your wedding was gonna be all poor or
boring or dull or whatever it was you were...

08:31.261 --> 08:33.554
You said our wedding was gonna be dull?
I said it was gonna be small.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.264
Small! Yup, that's
exactly what it was.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.808
I was thinking I could help you guys out
by throwing you a bachelorette party!

08:38.894 --> 08:44.023
Brad, you can totally come since you guys
decided to do that nontraditional mumbo jumbo.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.858
I think we're good.
You know what, though.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.402
I kinda would like to meet
some of your friends.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.362
Hold on here. Hold on.
What am I hearing?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.781
You haven't met
some of her great friends?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.575
It's just because this
happened really quickly.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.454
Is it a yes or a no? 'Cause you're kinda
holding up traffic here. It's- It's rude.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.331
[Man] Come on, lady!
Well...

09:00.457 --> 09:02.499
Look, I think it sounds great.
It sounds like fun. Okay, perfect!

09:02.584 --> 09:05.586
Wonderful! We've got a deal.
See you guys tomorrow night, my place, at 8:00.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.130
[Horns Honking] Bye, Brad.
Good to see you.

09:08.215 --> 09:12.301
Okay! Calm down, dick wads!
It wasn't that bad!

09:14.471 --> 09:18.474
## [Pop]

09:19.517 --> 09:23.020
[Coughing]

09:27.984 --> 09:30.361
Deandra, you got
any bacon bits?

09:30.487 --> 09:34.531
We like to put 'em in Artemis's hair
and they rain down on me when we bang.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.660
I feel like a Cobb salad.
It's amazing.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.788
Okay. I have no idea why anyone would
want to feel like a Cobb salad.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.374
But whatever, that's good.
Bring that up when Brad's here.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.834
All right, Mrs. Mac,
make sure that you talk...

09:45.919 --> 09:48.796
about how the waitress looks exactly
like you when you were young, right?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.423
You remember that? There's a whole
carton of cigarettes in it for you.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.343
[Coughing]
Uh, Mrs. Kelly, remember,

09:54.427 --> 09:57.888
this man that I'm bringing over, he wants
to steal the love of your son's life away.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.099
Nobody hurts my Charlie!

10:00.183 --> 10:02.184
Yup, that's good. That's good. Keep that up.
And keep the drinking coming.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.522
- 'Cause it makes you get all weird.
All right, this is- - [Knocking]

10:06.606 --> 10:09.858
Oh, okay. They're here. Is everyone ready?
You guys got it? Okay.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.612
[Clears Throat] There they are!

10:13.697 --> 10:16.782
Sorry we're late.
Somebody took a little convincing.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.994
Yup. I really didn't want
to come, but Brad insisted.

10:20.078 --> 10:25.124
Oh, you big, old, fat stick in the mud!
Come on in, you guys.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.459
- They're here, everybody!
- [Groans]

10:27.544 --> 10:30.379
- What's up? - Here you go.
Would you like some punch?

10:30.505 --> 10:32.589
Is there alcohol in this?
No, no, no, no.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.051
No, absolutely not. I remember what an
embarrassing problem you have with alcohol.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.097
Brad, did you know about her unfortunate
problems with drugs and alcohol?

10:40.223 --> 10:41.807
Isn’t that sad?
It's just alcohol.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.100
Is it?
And he's aware.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.226
Oh. Really?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.936
I thought there was,
like, cocaine and heroin.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.896
And remember when you were shooting
up with the homeless people...

10:48.023 --> 10:49.648
and banging for money on the street?
No. no.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.317
Wow. You're making
all of that up.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.152
Really? Oh, no, no, no, no.
You know what?

10:53.236 --> 10:56.572
You're absolutely right. I'm confusing you
with another pathetic drunk that I know.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.908
So you can still have fun,
can't you, Brad? I can. I...

10:59.993 --> 11:02.077
Let's get a beer.
Okay.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.288
Whoo-hoo.
You look really nice tonight.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.332
You like that?
You like that?

11:06.416 --> 11:10.794
[Dee] The color of this shirt. I don't know
what it's doing to your eyes, but I like it.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.631
## [Continues]

11:14.716 --> 11:18.302
- All right, listen. You gotta be on your
toes tonight, okay? - ## [Fades Out]

11:18.386 --> 11:19.887
This chick's a lawyer.
She's gonna be pretty sharp.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.889
Stick to the game plan, okay?
She's a lawyer. I like that.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.391
He's sweating through his shirt, dude.
I know.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.353
Listen, you remember
your backstory?

11:27.479 --> 11:29.646
No? Oh, for God's sakes!
What is that?

11:29.773 --> 11:31.690
I don't remember the backstory.
All right, listen, man. You're a philanthropist.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.567
That's what you are, okay?
You used to own a small business.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.195
But you gave all that up to help others.
All right, who do I help?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.988
Who am I helping?
Oh, God.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.617
It doesn't matter. I don't know, old people,
uh, children, autistics, dyslexic folks.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.453
It really doesn't matter, Charlie.
I'm a full on re...

11:44.537 --> 11:46.121
Ph-Philio- Philian-
Philanthropist.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.165
Dude, I can't get it.
How do you say it? What is it?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.918
[Together] Philanthropist!
Meet us in the bathroom.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.878
Oh, my God, dude! What is that?
What was that?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.797
Is that cheese?
Have you eaten cheese?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.758
How much cheese
have you eaten today?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.927
How much cheese
is too much cheese?

12:00.011 --> 12:02.596
Any amount of cheese before
a date is too much cheese!

12:02.680 --> 12:04.139
I had a lot of cheese.
I had a block of cheese.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.557
Okay, okay- You ate a
block of cheese today?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.476
I was very nervous.
I started eating cheese, man.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.894
All right. All right, all right.
Does that calm you down?

12:08.978 --> 12:10.396
Just don't breathe in her direction, okay?
Whatever you do.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.772
How do I look?
Relax.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.732
Stick to the game plan.
Do I look handsome?

12:13.817 --> 12:16.151
You look great.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.072
[Dee] Okay.
So I thought we would play a game.

12:20.198 --> 12:24.827
Sort of a newlywed-type of game.
And see how well you two know each other, okay?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.495
Okay, question number one.

12:26.579 --> 12:32.167
Who broke Brad's heart in high school
and feels really bad about it?

12:32.252 --> 12:37.589
Me. I broke Brad's heart in high school
and I feel really bad about it. Okay?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.925
Wait. You went to
high school with us?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.010
Yeah. I sat right
next to you in trig.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.848
Huh! Wow.
You are very forgettable.

12:45.932 --> 12:50.310
Anyway, I will have you all know that I
also broke Brad's heart in high school. So...

12:50.437 --> 12:51.937
You dated Dee?
Mmm.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.147
Briefly. Yeah.

12:53.231 --> 12:57.067
- We dated hard, yep. - Both you girls
dumped him because of his pizza face.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.903
Ooh! Okay.
Question number two.

12:59.988 --> 13:04.908
How many people in the room
have had sex with the bride-to-be?

13:04.993 --> 13:07.453
[Chuckles] Uh, just me I hope.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.539
- Ooh. - Whoops. Uh-uh.
Over here, guy.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.708
Ew!
Okay, you know what?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.420
That was a- That was a really dark time in
my life, and it was a terrible mistake.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.423
No, it's true. To be fair, it's true.
She's in love with my brother.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.925
They have a sex tape together.
This guy came along- No.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.554
I used to look like her.
Give me my cigarettes.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.056
Okay, I- I didn't tell you to go.
I didn't give you the high sign.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.226
Everybody's stealing
my Charlie, girl!

13:31.311 --> 13:34.396
- Oh! What the hell! - Okay, Brad.
I think it's time for us to go.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.981
We're gonna leave.
All right.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.942
Wait, no. No, no, no, no, Brad.
No, don't leave yet. I'm sorry.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.903
Hold on. No, no, don't leave.
Oh, you bitch!

13:40.987 --> 13:44.072
Oh! Goddamn it!
I should be the one getting married!

13:44.199 --> 13:48.285
This is depressing. Want to go get
sweaty in the bathroom? Sure do.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.038
No! No one's getting sweaty in my bathroom!
Just get out of here!

13:51.122 --> 13:53.874
Okay. We'll go get sweaty
in a Wendy's bathroom.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.709
Great! Go have sex at Wendy's!
Go for a ride.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.252
Wonderful!
Get out of here!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.588
- This party sucks!
- You suck!

13:59.714 --> 14:02.883
- I need a ride. - Oh, really?
Well, I ain't giving you shit, you old bitch!

14:02.967 --> 14:05.511
- [Knocking] - Oh, my God, no!
You can't borrow salad dressing!

14:05.595 --> 14:09.306
Or condiments! Or anything else you
two want to jam up into each other's...

14:09.390 --> 14:11.934
I, uh-
I forgot something.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.561
Oh. What?

14:14.646 --> 14:17.773
I forgot to tell you...

14:17.857 --> 14:20.108
I still love you.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.077
Hi.
Hi.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.330
Are you Charlie Kelly?
Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yeah.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.457
Sorry I'm late. Um-
You're Jackie.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.044
Yes, I am.
[Laughs] Are you all right?

14:39.128 --> 14:44.299
Oh, yeah, this?
I was running.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.760
Okay, because y-you're bleeding.
Oh, shit.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.804
Is it bleeding again?
I'm sorry.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.056
These are hornet stings,
you know?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.850
I run into, like- like a lot of,
like, hornets in my line of work.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.562
And I get stung up, like, bad
all over my face and stuff.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.606
And then, you know, it
starts bleeding. Oh.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.733
It sounds interesting.
Yeah.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.652
What is it that you do again?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.655
I'm work- I'm like a janitor at, um...

15:06.739 --> 15:10.075
I'm a full-on rapist,
you know?

15:10.159 --> 15:15.872
Uh, Africans, dyslexics,
children, that sort of thing.

15:17.041 --> 15:21.086
I'm sorry. Did you say
you're a full-on rapist?

15:21.170 --> 15:25.299
No! Did I say that?
No! No, no, no, no!

15:25.383 --> 15:28.010
I help- I help people.
You know what I mean? I'm...

15:28.094 --> 15:30.679
I'm a philan-
a philan- a philan...

15:30.805 --> 15:33.890
A philanthropist? Yeah!
That's exactly what it is.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.686
It gets blocked up in my mouth.
I don't say it no good, so...

15:39.480 --> 15:42.524
I'm a janitor at a bar.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.279
Oh, God, dude!
I'm sucking ass!

15:47.363 --> 15:49.239
Yeah, dude.
You said you were a rapist!

15:49.324 --> 15:51.241
I went crazy in the brain
for a second!

15:51.367 --> 15:53.702
Yeah. And my eyes were all like,
uh- And I couldn't think straight.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.996
That shirt is ruined. I know, dude.
Give me your shirt.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.789
What? Give you-
That's a totally different shirt.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.876
Yeah. Can I- How the hell are
you gonna explain that to her?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.878
I'll say I met a nice guy in the
bathroom and we traded shirts!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
Are you listening to yourself?
Jesus Christ!

16:04.589 --> 16:06.923
I'm freaking out, dude.
Okay, new plan. New plan. New plan.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.884
Charlie, make a move.
Just tell her you want to bang her.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.846
Ooh. No, that's- Is that how you get chicks?
Well, he's got a 50-50 shot.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.765
- That's a good point!
- It is a yes-or-no scenario.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.433
It is a no scenario!
Why?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.727
Don't approach her that way.
That's not gonna work. Am I getting the shirt?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.812
You're not gonna get the shirt.
This is what you're gonna do.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.898
Go back out there.
Start asking her questions about herself.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.525
Talk to her about being a lawyer, okay?
I can do that.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.361
Right? Right?
That's gonna work.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.738
If anything goes wrong, I'll come out there,
I'll say I'm the manager of Gugino's.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.114
Do you understand?
Okay.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.991
All right? I got it.
I know. I understand it.

16:33.117 --> 16:33.992
You good?
We'll be good.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.703
All right, great.
[Groaning]

16:39.707 --> 16:43.251
Just go. Just get out there.
Just go. Yeah.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.298
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
It took a little while.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.593
There was a guy in the bathroom.
He wouldn't give me his shirt. And I was fighting him.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.262
I'm, like, "Give me your shirt, bro.
" And he didn't want to give it to me.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.682
- And it was like a whole thing.
- Uh, uh, uhh!

16:56.766 --> 17:00.977
Hi. Uh, I'm the manager. And Mr.
Kelly is one of our preferred customers.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.647
It's so wonderful to see you here again
this evening. Right. My good man.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.775
Now I'm gonna want the milk
steak boiled over hard...

17:06.901 --> 17:11.320
and a side of your finest
jellybeans, raw. [Laughs]

17:11.406 --> 17:13.699
Mr. Kelly, you have the most
wonderful sense of humor.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.660
Hey, I own this joint.
And I know this guy. And he is loaded.

17:16.743 --> 17:20.329
Mr. Kelly, we have your milk boiling just the
way you like it back there for your steak.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.458
You're gonna like this.
How's about I clear out the coat room...

17:23.542 --> 17:26.545
and you guys hit it in there
while the steak is getting ready?

17:26.628 --> 17:28.255
- What?
- What in the hell are you doing?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.297
I got this.
He's gonna be aggressive.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.174
I've got this.
Charlie, make a move. Maul.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.592
No, don't-
Oh, my God!

17:32.677 --> 17:34.886
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving!

17:34.971 --> 17:36.555
You're grabbing her breasts?
What are you doing?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.306
I don't know. What does
"make a move" mean?

17:38.433 --> 17:41.184
It doesn't mean stab at her breasts
with your fingers. Oh, man!

17:41.269 --> 17:43.437
Come on, bro. You're ordering milk
steak and jellybeans? What the hell?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.689
Come on, you guys blew it, dude!
We blew it?

17:45.815 --> 17:48.567
I told you to stick with the game plan!
It was going great! I had it!

17:48.651 --> 17:49.776
You don't know shit
about chicks, man!

17:49.861 --> 17:51.945
- We don't know shit about chicks?
- Yeah!

17:52.029 --> 17:54.614
Well, guess what, bro. The waitress
is getting married. So suck on that!

17:58.327 --> 18:00.579
I see.

18:00.663 --> 18:04.833
Well, I suppose I'll be taking
that milk steak to go then.

18:10.339 --> 18:15.093
Yeah. And so the Wendy's manager
is all, "You gotta clean that up!"

18:15.178 --> 18:17.137
And I said, "They're your hamburgers.
You clean 'em up."

18:17.221 --> 18:19.306
And then Artemis
got all bummed out...

18:19.390 --> 18:21.600
because of something
I did with the onions to myself.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.353
And now she won't talk to me.
Frank, I don't give a shit about any of this.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.272
Hey, man, where's
the baseball bat?

18:27.398 --> 18:28.940
Baseball bat in the corner.
Oh.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.318
We're trying to arm ourselves 'cause
Charlie's gonna be here any minute,

18:31.402 --> 18:33.361
and he might take us out, so...

18:33.446 --> 18:37.240
Oh, don't worry about Charlie.
Charlie's over this.

18:37.325 --> 18:42.037
In fact, I saw him this morning.
He said he was bringing the guy a congratulatory gift.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.623
Really?
Yeah.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.916
Oh, great.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.211
[Doorbell Buzzes]

18:52.215 --> 18:55.050
Hey, what's- what's, uh-
what's this?

18:55.134 --> 18:59.721
This is for your engagement, man.
You're a lucky, lucky dude.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.681
And, uh, congratulations to you.
Oh, right.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.643
No, no, no. That's not happening anymore.
We're not, uh- We're not engaged.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.312
You're not getting married?
Nah.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.857
Oh!
You're Charlie Kelly, right?

19:10.942 --> 19:13.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember you from high school.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.862
Hang on a second, dude.
You're not getting married?

19:15.947 --> 19:18.156
Well-
[Clears Throat]

19:18.241 --> 19:21.868
Remember how everybody used to
make fun of us in high school?

19:21.953 --> 19:24.704
I remember how
they made fun of you.

19:24.789 --> 19:28.959
Anyway, I have been
getting my revenge.

19:29.043 --> 19:32.254
I've been getting engaged to all these chicks
who broke up with me in high school...

19:32.338 --> 19:34.881
'cause of my acne, and then I dump
'em right before the wedding.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.467
[Chuckles] Damn.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.511
Yeah. I just got through doing it
to that coffee shop waitress.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.638
Now I'm gonna do it to this chick
Dee Reynolds. Remember her?

19:41.764 --> 19:43.807
She was the worst.
Yeah.

19:43.933 --> 19:48.603
Uh, so that coffee shop waitress, she must've
been hurt kinda bad by that though, right?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.273
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She was- She was devastated.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.316
Oh.
So...

19:53.401 --> 19:57.153
Well, tell you what, man. Why don't you
go ahead and have this present anyway?

19:57.280 --> 20:01.408
Really? Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I feel like you deserve it.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.369
[Chuckles] Well, thanks, dude.
Yeah.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.497
That's- That's rad.
All right. Okay.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.543
Well, keep it real, man.
Okay. Okay.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.378
All right.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.630
[Buzzing Faintly]

20:15.715 --> 20:18.133

20:58.758 --> 21:01.676
