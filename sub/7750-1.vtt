00:28.980 --> 00:32.859
I think what you people do is heroic.

00:34.865 --> 00:38.508
You wash clothes you can't afford.

00:38.543 --> 00:41.319
You polish silver you will never dine with.

00:41.354 --> 00:44.095
You mop floors for people who don't bother

00:44.130 --> 00:45.833
to learn your last name,

00:45.868 --> 00:49.261
and still, you dare to dream of a better life.

00:49.296 --> 00:52.656
I am in awe of your determination to succeed

00:52.691 --> 00:55.666
in this great country of ours.

00:55.701 --> 00:57.871
That said...

00:57.907 --> 00:59.177
if you don't stop screwing my husband,

00:59.212 --> 01:02.488
I'm going to have you deported.

01:02.523 --> 01:04.494
å¤Comprende?

01:07.404 --> 01:09.561
Good.

01:09.596 --> 01:11.682
Adrian?

01:11.717 --> 01:15.444
Is there something you'd like to say to Flora?

01:15.479 --> 01:19.171
I'm sorry that l allowed myself to be seduced.

01:22.118 --> 01:24.726
Repeatedly.

01:26.733 --> 01:29.173
Obviously, from this moment forward,

01:29.208 --> 01:31.615
when l ask you to do the windows,

01:31.650 --> 01:33.588
you will do them.

01:51.646 --> 01:54.521
Oh, Evelyn, how are you?

01:54.556 --> 01:58.201
Not great. l just found out my maid has "Feelings"

01:58.236 --> 02:00.141
For my husband.

02:00.176 --> 02:02.012
It's nuts, right?

02:02.047 --> 02:04.136
I mean, why would anyone fall in love with Adrian?

02:04.171 --> 02:06.227
You'Il have to forgive my wife.

02:06.262 --> 02:09.705
She's drunk... and evil.

02:49.934 --> 02:51.138
Aah!

02:54.315 --> 02:55.720
Aah!

03:45.012 --> 03:46.449
I think we're just about done here,

03:46.484 --> 03:48.422
and we should be out of your way in a few minutes.

03:48.457 --> 03:52.135
Uh... l don't understand. What do you mean, you're done?

03:52.170 --> 03:53.808
Well, we collected all the evidence,

03:53.843 --> 03:55.411
and we have a suspect in custody.

03:55.446 --> 03:58.255
But all this blood on the furniture

03:58.290 --> 04:00.026
and the carpeting...

04:00.061 --> 04:01.783
don't worry, ma'am. We have photos of everything.

04:01.818 --> 04:03.506
All right, people. Pack it up. Let's get going.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.028
I don't care about photos!

04:05.063 --> 04:06.515
I don't care about evidence!

04:06.550 --> 04:10.093
My maid was murdered!

04:10.128 --> 04:11.797
Ma'am?

04:11.832 --> 04:15.612
Well, who is going to clean all this up?

04:18.487 --> 04:21.497
♪♪♪

04:27.851 --> 04:31.860
"Dios todopoderoso...

04:32.265 --> 04:34.907
"Y escucha a sus oraciones.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.114
Escucha a tu gente..."

04:54.103 --> 04:57.914
"Dios Todopoderoso..."

05:11.057 --> 05:12.563
We have to go to the police.

05:12.598 --> 05:13.899
Are you crazy?

05:13.934 --> 05:15.639
They need to know the truth about Flora.

05:15.674 --> 05:17.644
Why? They already arrested someone.

05:17.679 --> 05:20.756
Well, maybe he didn't do it. Maybe Flora was killed

05:20.791 --> 05:21.993
'cause of what she was doing.

05:22.028 --> 05:23.629
If we go to the cops,

05:23.665 --> 05:25.270
they'Il ask why we did nothing to stop her.

05:25.305 --> 05:28.247
Mami's right. We could get in trouble.

05:28.282 --> 05:31.154
I wish she never told us.

05:31.189 --> 05:34.634
This was Flora's secret. l say we let it die with her.

05:47.877 --> 05:49.916
So the job requires cooking, cleaning,

05:49.951 --> 05:51.957
taking our clothes to the cleaners.

05:51.992 --> 05:53.193
Doing what needs to be done.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.964
Exactly.

05:54.999 --> 05:58.177
And, uh, we're hoping to find someone to live in.

05:58.212 --> 06:00.316
As it happens, that's the situation

06:00.351 --> 06:01.754
that l'm looking for.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.992
Terrific.

06:06.905 --> 06:10.015
Do you have any questions for me, Mrs. Stafford?

06:12.355 --> 06:13.894
You don't have an accent.

06:13.929 --> 06:15.865
Should l?

06:15.900 --> 06:19.846
I've never met a maid who didn't have an accent.

06:19.881 --> 06:23.022
I was born here in L.A.

06:23.057 --> 06:25.765
You sound like you went to college.

06:28.307 --> 06:30.413
Thank you.

06:32.454 --> 06:35.196
Would you excuse us for a moment?

06:36.968 --> 06:38.707
Give us just a second.

06:40.948 --> 06:43.455
She has attitude.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.226
Because she doesn't have an accent?

06:45.262 --> 06:47.135
I just don't like her, okay? l want Lupe back.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.872
You know that can't happen.

06:48.907 --> 06:51.516
Why do you refuse to take my side?

06:51.551 --> 06:53.455
I'm getting so sick of this.

06:53.490 --> 06:54.958
Mrs. Stafford.

06:54.993 --> 06:59.104
I want this job. So l'Il make you a deal.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.180
After a week, if you're not satisfied with my work,

07:01.215 --> 07:04.090
or if you think l still have attitude,

07:04.125 --> 07:05.492
I'Il leave.

07:05.527 --> 07:08.269
No questions asked.

07:10.175 --> 07:12.816
That's a very generous offer,

07:12.851 --> 07:16.162
and we would be fools not to accept it.

07:48.198 --> 07:50.102
Where is she? In her room.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.546
How many pills did she take? Not sure. Maybe the whole bottle.

08:00.437 --> 08:03.581
Remi, thank god you're here.

08:05.923 --> 08:07.159
Mom, it's me.

08:07.194 --> 08:08.362
Go away!

08:08.397 --> 08:09.768
Now don't be like that, mom.

08:09.803 --> 08:11.104
We'Il get you to the hospital

08:11.139 --> 08:12.794
and get your stomach pumped, all right?

08:12.829 --> 08:14.450
I'm tired of being humiliated.

08:14.485 --> 08:17.426
Just let me die.

08:17.461 --> 08:19.082
Humiliated?

08:19.117 --> 08:20.668
Jamal left her.

08:20.704 --> 08:22.977
Mom, you were dating our pool boy?

08:23.012 --> 08:25.251
I've always been partial to armenians.

08:25.286 --> 08:26.554
You know that.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.333
Only this one turned out to be so cruel.

08:30.368 --> 08:34.376
He said he was embarrassed to introduce me to his friends.

08:34.581 --> 08:38.057
He said l looked like l was 40!

08:38.092 --> 08:40.133
Well, that's not bad, since you're almost 60.

08:40.168 --> 08:41.635
Ohh! Aah!

08:41.669 --> 08:43.711
Mom, mom, mom, l realize you're upset, all right?

08:43.746 --> 08:45.215
But you can't swallow a bottle of pills

08:45.250 --> 08:47.020
every time a guy leaves you.

08:47.055 --> 08:49.696
don't you see what's happening?

08:49.731 --> 08:51.735
I'm getting older.

08:51.770 --> 08:55.779
So no handsome man will want anything to do with me.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.524
And the sad truth is,

08:58.559 --> 09:02.337
I'm just not designed to be alone!

09:04.311 --> 09:07.251
Mrs. Delatour?

09:07.286 --> 09:09.828
If you're lonely, maybe Mr. Remi could move back home.

09:12.202 --> 09:14.276
But he's going to school.

09:14.311 --> 09:16.350
Just U.S.C. He could commute.

09:18.122 --> 09:21.196
It's a stunning idea, remi.

09:21.232 --> 09:25.241
I wouldn't even know how to be depressed with you here.

09:27.519 --> 09:29.659
Mom, if-if l promise to move back home,

09:29.694 --> 09:31.097
will you go to the hospital?

09:31.132 --> 09:32.734
Absolutely.

09:32.769 --> 09:35.342
Just let me put my face on first.

09:35.377 --> 09:38.354
don't wanna scare the nurses.

09:38.389 --> 09:39.592
Zoila, come.

09:46.714 --> 09:48.787
That was some quick thinking there.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.429
Just glad l could help.

10:01.829 --> 10:03.435
He's here.

10:15.874 --> 10:17.881
Welcome home. How was the tour?

10:17.916 --> 10:19.752
Long.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.429
I can't believe l'm finally meeting Alejandro Rubio.

10:22.464 --> 10:23.832
Now don't come on too strong.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.474
Relax. We're gonna be best of friends.

10:26.509 --> 10:29.619
And why would he wanna be friends with the maid?

10:29.654 --> 10:31.858
Have you seen me?

10:31.893 --> 10:33.665
Is this Bonita's replacement?

10:33.700 --> 10:34.868
Yes.

10:34.903 --> 10:36.473
Her name is Carmen.

10:36.509 --> 10:38.515
Oh. It's nice to have you with us, Carmen.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.238
Hopefully you won't steal the silver.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.926
Not that there's any left to steal.

10:43.364 --> 10:44.666
It is so wonderful to meet you.

10:44.701 --> 10:46.875
And you should know l am your biggest fan,

10:46.910 --> 10:49.048
and l am thrilled to be working with you.

10:49.084 --> 10:53.057
Go. l'Il take care of this.

10:54.065 --> 10:57.274
You don't talk to Alejandro.

10:57.309 --> 10:59.382
You talk to me, then l talk to him.

10:59.417 --> 11:01.287
If he wants to speak to you,

11:01.322 --> 11:03.378
answer with As few words as possible.

11:03.414 --> 11:05.435
Can l at least say... "Good morning"?

11:05.470 --> 11:06.904
No.

11:06.939 --> 11:09.381
He will tell you if it's a good morning.

11:20.517 --> 11:22.689
I got some good news yesterday.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.030
I finally found a lawyer for immigration.

11:25.065 --> 11:27.607
He said that he could help me bring Miguel to America.

11:27.642 --> 11:29.010
Who's Miguel?

11:29.045 --> 11:31.519
That's her kid. Back in guadalajara.

11:31.554 --> 11:34.863
But, uh... there is a problem.

11:36.401 --> 11:38.607
This lawyer- He's in San Diego.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.782
He only comes to Los Angeles once a month.

11:40.817 --> 11:42.655
I could see him Friday or saturday,

11:42.690 --> 11:45.630
but l need a day off.

11:45.665 --> 11:47.502
I've got back-to-back appointments on Friday,

11:47.537 --> 11:49.978
and saturday, l'm being interviewed by "Showbiz L.A."

11:50.014 --> 11:51.782
Move the interview.

11:51.818 --> 11:53.591
Or are you afraid you'd actually have to spend time

11:53.626 --> 11:55.395
with our child. Hey.

11:55.430 --> 11:57.737
I'm a good mother, but l've gotta stay focused

11:57.772 --> 12:00.779
now that l have a feature career.

12:00.814 --> 12:02.517
You've only been in three movies,

12:02.552 --> 12:04.575
and you battled aliens in two of them.

12:04.610 --> 12:06.599
Stop acting like you're Dame Judi dench.

12:06.634 --> 12:07.903
It still beats being a sex symbol

12:07.939 --> 12:09.205
for bored housewives.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.600
Hey, l won two "Soap opera digest" Awards.

12:11.635 --> 12:14.067
The fact that you think that's impressive

12:14.102 --> 12:16.500
makes me wanna vomit and weep for you.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.931
See... the thing about this lawyer,

12:20.966 --> 12:23.622
he's the only one l could afford.

12:23.657 --> 12:26.131
I'm sorry, Rosie. l just can't spare you right now.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.476
But take it as a compliment.

12:29.511 --> 12:32.786
My little boy needs you.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.402
The D.A. called.

12:48.437 --> 12:49.674
They're finally charging that waiter

12:49.709 --> 12:51.110
with Flora's murder.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.189
That's good news. Don't you think?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.340
For god sake.

13:00.376 --> 13:02.716
How much more infantile pouting do l have to put up with?

13:02.751 --> 13:04.454
I'm sad.

13:04.489 --> 13:06.125
Can't l be sad?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.234
Flora was the help. It's time to smile again.

13:09.806 --> 13:13.518
She was the most exhilarating woman l have ever known.

13:13.553 --> 13:14.822
Then you should get out more.

13:14.857 --> 13:17.094
I was in love with her.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.273
And l was teaching her to love me.

13:22.713 --> 13:26.225
You weren't the only man Flora was having an affair with.

13:26.260 --> 13:29.803
You do realize that, don't you?

13:35.489 --> 13:38.296
That boy they arrested...

13:38.331 --> 13:40.203
You think he actually killed her?

13:40.238 --> 13:43.145
No. But if we say anything,

13:43.180 --> 13:45.520
they'Il start to examine our lives,

13:45.555 --> 13:47.861
and we can't have that, now, can we?

13:47.897 --> 13:50.822
So we do nothing?

13:50.857 --> 13:53.748
Less than nothing.

14:04.749 --> 14:07.891
Mrs. Stafford, l finished the laundry.

14:07.926 --> 14:11.237
Thanks. Uh, the kitchen sink is stopped up.

14:11.272 --> 14:12.474
If you could take care of that...

14:12.509 --> 14:14.914
Are you okay?

14:14.949 --> 14:18.761
Uh, l'm just having a bad day.

14:18.796 --> 14:21.571
You wanna talk about it?

14:23.644 --> 14:27.991
I'm... not sure you'd understand this kind of problem.

14:35.314 --> 14:37.195
I may unclog drains for a living,

14:37.230 --> 14:39.076
but that doesn't mean l'm stupid,

14:39.111 --> 14:40.345
and for what it's worth,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.724
my friends say l give really good advice.

14:47.135 --> 14:50.010
What do you think of... our house?

14:50.045 --> 14:52.316
It's beautiful.

14:52.351 --> 14:55.378
Every chair, painting, and throw pillow

14:55.413 --> 14:58.405
was carefully chosen by Olivia Rice.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.078
Isn't she a famous decorator?

15:01.113 --> 15:02.684
She's also the first Mrs. Stafford

15:02.719 --> 15:04.523
and a world-class psycho.

15:04.558 --> 15:07.434
For 20 years, she made Michael's life unbearable-

15:07.469 --> 15:09.206
Always insulting him, screaming at him.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.513
She even slapped him a few times.

15:11.548 --> 15:12.716
Really?

15:12.751 --> 15:14.122
Michael had to divorce her.

15:14.157 --> 15:15.458
But he still felt guilty.

15:15.493 --> 15:18.035
He gave Olivia everything she asked for-

15:18.070 --> 15:20.743
the jaguar, the summer house, Lupe.

15:20.778 --> 15:22.280
Lupe?

15:22.315 --> 15:24.455
Their maid.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.561
Lovely woman.

15:26.596 --> 15:29.204
The only thing l asked him to fight for,

15:29.239 --> 15:31.745
but Olivia wanted her, so...

15:31.780 --> 15:33.549
so...

15:33.584 --> 15:36.258
why were you crying?

15:36.293 --> 15:40.072
I asked Michael if l could redecorate this place.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.810
You know, make it my own.

15:41.845 --> 15:45.854
He said no. He thought it would offend Olivia.

15:46.493 --> 15:48.265
We've been married for six months,

15:48.300 --> 15:49.668
and she still comes first.

15:49.703 --> 15:52.580
I don't know how much more of this l can take.

15:54.151 --> 15:56.524
anyway...

15:56.559 --> 15:59.335
I'm ready for that good advice now.

16:02.243 --> 16:04.200
Michael chose you.

16:04.235 --> 16:06.121
Which means you won.

16:06.156 --> 16:08.665
Her hold on him will weaken...

16:08.700 --> 16:10.301
eventually.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.547
In the meantime, focus on what's important.

16:13.582 --> 16:14.716
You have your health.

16:14.751 --> 16:16.390
You have money to pay your bills

16:16.425 --> 16:18.163
and someone who adores you.

16:18.198 --> 16:19.866
In the grand scheme of things,

16:19.901 --> 16:23.345
an ex-wife's throw pillows aren't much of a problem.

16:26.321 --> 16:27.693
See?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.408
I knew you wouldn't understand.

16:36.588 --> 16:39.295
I'm serious, Zoila.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.369
This new therapist is a genius.

16:41.404 --> 16:44.313
He could tell that l needed to be on mood stabilizers

16:44.348 --> 16:46.487
within five minutes of meeting me.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.660
It took him that long?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.499
Hey. What's all this?

17:42.534 --> 17:44.039
I thought you might like some tea.

17:44.075 --> 17:46.915
Oh. That was nice of you.

17:46.950 --> 17:48.986
Why two cups?

17:49.022 --> 17:51.461
Oh! Uh...

17:51.496 --> 17:53.737
I'm so used to preparing the tray for your mom

17:53.772 --> 17:55.408
when she has company.

17:55.443 --> 17:57.432
I guess l wasn't thinking. Sorry.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.387
Well, hey, since you're here,

17:59.422 --> 18:02.098
why not stay and have a cup of tea with me?

18:05.541 --> 18:07.114
If you insist.

18:19.587 --> 18:21.208
Hi.

18:21.243 --> 18:22.796
Hello.

18:22.831 --> 18:24.100
I saw you coming out

18:24.135 --> 18:25.573
of the Stafford house this morning.

18:25.608 --> 18:26.977
Did you take over for Lupe?

18:27.012 --> 18:29.619
Yes. l'm the new maid.

18:29.654 --> 18:31.056
Oh.

18:31.091 --> 18:33.131
Lupe told us Mr. Stafford's new wife

18:33.166 --> 18:34.735
is a hot mess.

18:34.770 --> 18:38.447
What do you think?

18:38.482 --> 18:41.723
Oh, she's okay. Just a bit insecure.

18:41.758 --> 18:44.768
God, is it awful of me to gossip about my employers?

18:44.803 --> 18:47.778
Honey, if you're gonna sit by us, it's a requirement.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.218
One time Miss Genevieve asked me to hand her shampoo

19:00.253 --> 19:01.890
while she was still in the shower.

19:01.925 --> 19:03.362
That's not so bad.

19:03.397 --> 19:04.800
She wasn't alone.

19:06.538 --> 19:08.242
They were in there for another hour.

19:08.277 --> 19:12.123
The whole time, l'm thinking, lord, l have to clean that.

19:17.139 --> 19:20.986
so... do you know all the maids who work around here?

19:21.021 --> 19:22.990
Sure.

19:23.025 --> 19:26.235
What about the girl who got killed?

19:27.707 --> 19:30.548
Her name was Flora.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.320
That had to have been a shock.

19:32.355 --> 19:35.131
I would've been more shocked if she had been somewhere else.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.138
But those people she worked for...

19:37.173 --> 19:39.144
the powells? What about them?

19:39.179 --> 19:42.655
They're... strange.

19:42.690 --> 19:43.958
In what way?

19:43.993 --> 19:46.383
It's late. We have to get going.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.775
It was so nice to meet you, Marisol.

19:48.810 --> 19:50.010
You, too.

19:50.046 --> 19:52.320
Come on, Rosie.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.165
Venga. Venga, vengas.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.309
see you around.

19:59.344 --> 20:00.713
Yeah.

20:02.954 --> 20:06.798
What is wrong with you, Rosie?

20:06.833 --> 20:10.345
Yeah, at first, l wasn't sure about moving back home.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.684
I forgot how nice it is here.

20:12.719 --> 20:14.324
No one waits on me back at the frat house.

20:14.359 --> 20:17.969
I like waiting on you.

20:18.004 --> 20:19.172
Oh!

20:19.207 --> 20:21.481
You spilled.

20:21.516 --> 20:23.287
Uh...

20:25.126 --> 20:27.097
uh... so...

20:27.132 --> 20:29.942
what would you like for breakfast tomorrow?

20:29.977 --> 20:31.979
I'd love to cook for you.

20:32.014 --> 20:34.755
Oh. Uh, l don't know.

20:34.790 --> 20:37.096
I like all sorts of things.

20:37.131 --> 20:38.736
Do you know how to make French toast?

20:38.771 --> 20:42.147
No. But l'm eager to learn.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.140
Oh, l'm telling you, Taylor,

21:00.175 --> 21:02.047
the house has become a disaster area.

21:02.082 --> 21:03.885
I've got dirty dishes in the sink,

21:03.920 --> 21:06.293
laundry piling up. l'm at my wit's end.

21:06.328 --> 21:09.087
Why don't you call the agency? Have them send somebody?

21:09.122 --> 21:11.846
I tried. They gave me attitude because Flora was murdered.

21:11.881 --> 21:14.756
I'd understand if l'd had a few maids slaughtered,

21:14.791 --> 21:18.266
but l've only lost the one. It's not fair.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.144
I could come clean your house.

21:22.179 --> 21:24.981
I mean, if you're having trouble finding someone.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.454
That is so sweet.

21:26.489 --> 21:27.808
Thank you, Lupe.

21:27.843 --> 21:29.093
It's Marisol.

21:29.128 --> 21:30.270
I thought her name was Lupe.

21:30.305 --> 21:31.379
That was the previous maid.

21:31.414 --> 21:33.118
Oh, well, you could be her twin.

21:33.153 --> 21:35.025
She looks nothing like Lupe. l thought she had work done.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.998
You thought our maid had plastic surgery?

21:37.033 --> 21:38.200
For god sake, Taylor.

21:38.235 --> 21:41.344
Poor people like to be pretty, too.

21:41.379 --> 21:44.154
Come over in the morning. Bring your own supplies.

21:44.189 --> 21:47.632
I have nine bathrooms. We'Il have fun.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.181
What is that?

22:03.216 --> 22:05.524
Oh, it's juice for Alejandro.

22:05.559 --> 22:07.328
He asked for juice?

22:07.363 --> 22:09.369
No, but l was watching him work out,

22:09.405 --> 22:11.341
and l thought he might be thirsty.

22:11.376 --> 22:13.716
You should be looking at this filthy kitchen,

22:13.751 --> 22:16.057
not outside.

22:22.512 --> 22:23.680
What's wrong, princesa?

22:23.715 --> 22:26.222
The only reason l took this job

22:26.257 --> 22:28.061
was so l become friends with Alejandro

22:28.096 --> 22:30.119
and play him my music, but that's never gonna happen

22:30.154 --> 22:32.142
if that limping bitch keeps running interference.

22:32.177 --> 22:34.015
She's just trying to protect Alejandro.

22:34.050 --> 22:35.552
From me?

22:35.587 --> 22:38.731
If there's one thing Odessa knows how to spot,

22:38.766 --> 22:40.702
it's a pretty girl with an agenda.

22:40.737 --> 22:43.713
Well, if she's that paranoid, why hire me in the first place?

22:43.748 --> 22:46.320
Well, l helped with the interviews.

22:46.355 --> 22:51.138
After meeting you, l may have lost the other resumes.

22:53.177 --> 22:55.015
Sam?

22:55.050 --> 22:56.672
Do you have a crush on me?

22:56.707 --> 22:58.587
I'm not admitting nothin'.

22:58.622 --> 23:00.432
aw. Why didn't you tell me?

23:00.467 --> 23:02.708
Thought you were out of my league.

23:02.744 --> 23:04.247
Oh, l am.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.716
But still...

23:05.751 --> 23:09.096
it's good to know.

23:12.640 --> 23:16.118
Look... l want you to be careful around Odessa.

23:16.153 --> 23:17.790
She's smart.

23:19.562 --> 23:22.371
Not as smart as l am.

23:28.291 --> 23:29.593
å¤Hola?

23:29.629 --> 23:31.835
Mama? It's Rosie.

23:35.146 --> 23:36.384
Rosie!

23:37.822 --> 23:39.426
Rosie?!

23:41.165 --> 23:42.436
Rosie, you've gotta take the baby!

23:42.471 --> 23:44.409
I'm late for my thing!

24:45.440 --> 24:46.843
Oh!

24:46.878 --> 24:50.088
Mrs. Peri. l didn't see you.

24:50.123 --> 24:52.327
Is something wrong?

24:52.362 --> 24:56.007
I was just talking to my son.

24:56.042 --> 24:58.081
Is he okay?

24:59.485 --> 25:01.924
He's young.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.437
He doesn't understand why l haven't brought him here yet.

25:05.472 --> 25:09.450
Can't his dad explain it to him?

25:11.892 --> 25:15.101
Miguel's father died.

25:15.136 --> 25:19.145
That's why l have to come here-to work.

25:20.085 --> 25:22.994
Oh.

25:32.191 --> 25:34.798
So...

25:34.833 --> 25:37.441
I'm late for a facial.

25:40.083 --> 25:44.092
And l can't... miss this appointment

25:44.931 --> 25:47.105
because l'm being interviewed tomorrow,

25:47.140 --> 25:51.114
and... my pores are just...

25:53.793 --> 25:55.129
Go.

25:55.164 --> 25:58.609
I'Il take care of your baby.

26:02.556 --> 26:05.197
Thanks.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.708
Ah, the cavalry has arrived.

26:13.743 --> 26:16.131
And she's brought disinfectant.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.905
Hello, Mrs. Powell. Where would you like me to start?

26:17.940 --> 26:20.564
I was thinking the study.

26:20.599 --> 26:23.189
That's where it happened.

26:25.061 --> 26:27.552
Sorry about the blood and gore.

26:27.588 --> 26:29.785
I was going to clean it myself,

26:29.821 --> 26:32.256
but l wasn't emotionally capable.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.110
Flora and l were so close, you see.

26:34.145 --> 26:35.929
Don't worry. l'Il take care of it.

26:35.964 --> 26:37.769
Just go and relax.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.539
Oh, you're a cherub.

26:39.574 --> 26:42.316
That's what you are. You're a spicy little cherub.

27:20.173 --> 27:21.877
Sorry.

27:21.912 --> 27:25.289
For a second there, l thought you were someone else.

27:25.324 --> 27:27.629
I'm Marisol.

27:27.664 --> 27:29.233
I'm here to clean your home.

27:29.268 --> 27:30.874
Of course. Evelyn mentioned that you were stopping by.

27:30.909 --> 27:32.998
It's very kind of you.

27:33.033 --> 27:35.052
Oh, l'm happy to do it.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.796
I know you and your wife have been through a lot.

27:37.831 --> 27:39.368
Did you know Flora?

27:39.403 --> 27:41.207
No.

27:43.113 --> 27:45.287
This is a picture that l took.

27:47.751 --> 27:50.592
She was very lovely.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.974
Oh, she was smart and funny and vibrant.

27:54.009 --> 27:55.979
Very ambitious.

27:57.820 --> 28:01.829
Are you ambitious...

28:02.134 --> 28:03.938
Marisol?

28:03.973 --> 28:07.982
There are things l want.

28:09.023 --> 28:13.032
Well, if you continue to be this nice to me...

28:17.517 --> 28:19.791
I will see to it that you get them.

28:49.389 --> 28:50.732
Did you feed him?

28:50.767 --> 28:52.440
I can't have him screaming during this interview.

28:52.475 --> 28:53.709
He's had his bottle,

28:53.744 --> 28:55.282
but he might need his diaper changed soon.

28:56.786 --> 28:59.796
if you humiliate me, we are going to have a problem.

29:01.803 --> 29:04.544
Oh, they sent Brenda Colfax?

29:04.579 --> 29:06.986
This will be the best acting l do all year.

29:07.021 --> 29:09.292
Brenda!

29:09.327 --> 29:11.266
Peri Westmore.

29:11.301 --> 29:12.503
How long has it been?

29:12.538 --> 29:14.543
The red carpet at the oscars.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.851
That's right. Aw, do you forgive me for what l said

29:16.886 --> 29:18.724
about your dress? Of course!

29:18.759 --> 29:20.564
I was just trying to be funny.

29:20.599 --> 29:21.901
And you came so close.

29:35.679 --> 29:37.083
Ma? Where have you been? l was getting worried.

29:37.118 --> 29:38.822
I went shopping. l bought us some clothes.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.593
Clothes?

29:40.628 --> 29:42.669
Yeah, but l wasn't sure of your size. Go try this on.

29:54.674 --> 29:56.578
Mama...

29:56.613 --> 29:58.050
what is this?

29:58.085 --> 29:59.522
Our new uniform. We're gonna wear it at work.

29:59.558 --> 30:00.725
Why?

30:00.760 --> 30:01.996
Because...

30:02.031 --> 30:04.538
those people in that house

30:04.573 --> 30:07.521
need to be reminded of what we're there to do.

30:13.903 --> 30:16.542
Rich boys...

30:16.577 --> 30:20.524
they never fall in love with the help.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.902
Trust me on this.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.703
Hey. What's that?

30:34.738 --> 30:36.641
Alejandro's ipod.

30:36.676 --> 30:38.148
Songs have been added...

30:38.183 --> 30:40.622
by Carmen Luna.

30:40.657 --> 30:42.594
Explain.

30:42.629 --> 30:45.873
Okay, as you know, l'm a Singer.

30:45.908 --> 30:47.610
No. You never tell me this.

30:47.645 --> 30:50.052
Well, l thought that If he liked my songs,

30:50.087 --> 30:51.623
he would wanna help me.

30:51.658 --> 30:54.030
It's not a big deal, is it?

30:54.065 --> 30:58.074
Every day, l see people wanting things from him.

30:58.915 --> 31:01.990
Needing money. Asking favors.

31:02.025 --> 31:05.368
Because he is a good man, he finds it hard to say "No."

31:05.403 --> 31:08.713
It's my job to protect him from people like that...

31:08.748 --> 31:10.049
people like you.

31:10.084 --> 31:12.591
For god sake, Odessa, this is my dream.

31:12.627 --> 31:14.097
What is that to him?

31:14.132 --> 31:15.469
I work in his house.

31:15.504 --> 31:17.676
He should care about me.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.849
Do you care about him?

31:19.884 --> 31:22.508
Yeah. Sure, l do.

31:22.543 --> 31:24.841
You don't care.

31:24.876 --> 31:27.104
Not like l do.

31:27.139 --> 31:30.249
Still, l think he would enjoy helping someone

31:30.284 --> 31:31.671
who's just starting out.

31:31.706 --> 31:33.058
If you play him your music,

31:33.093 --> 31:34.914
even one song,

31:34.949 --> 31:36.930
I will fire you.

31:36.965 --> 31:38.910
Do you understand?

31:41.652 --> 31:42.856
Good.

31:46.903 --> 31:50.431
Oh. For what it is worth...

31:50.466 --> 31:53.959
I listened to all your songs.

31:53.994 --> 31:55.763
What do you think?

31:55.798 --> 31:59.711
I think you should get a new dream.

32:06.232 --> 32:09.842
So, Peri, l hear scorsese is directing this film.

32:09.877 --> 32:12.385
Were you stunned when you heard that he wanted to work with you?

32:12.420 --> 32:14.124
'cause l know l was.

32:15.830 --> 32:18.001
Rosie, l think the baby needs changing.

32:18.036 --> 32:20.411
Unless that awful smell is coming from Brenda.

32:20.446 --> 32:21.981
Ooh.

32:22.016 --> 32:24.088
Oh.

32:24.123 --> 32:28.132
So... you're a busy actress and a full-time mother.

32:29.507 --> 32:32.247
How do you do it?

32:32.282 --> 32:36.028
It is not easy, but l work really hard at it.

32:36.063 --> 32:37.834
I am a spectacular mom.

32:39.405 --> 32:41.779
And your movie shoots in Rome. Will you take him on location?

32:41.815 --> 32:43.417
Of course.

32:43.452 --> 32:46.127
Some women may be able to run off to a foreign country,

32:46.162 --> 32:48.902
leaving their kid behind with someone else,

32:48.937 --> 32:50.841
but l can't.

32:50.876 --> 32:53.225
To me, there's no excuse for abandoning your child.

32:57.932 --> 33:01.476
Switching topics, let's talk about your leading man.

33:01.511 --> 33:03.448
Mrs. Westmore!

33:03.483 --> 33:06.092
Rosie, be quiet! We're rolling!

33:06.127 --> 33:07.528
But the baby!

33:07.563 --> 33:09.502
What about the baby? Is something wrong?

33:09.537 --> 33:11.073
No, he's fine.

33:11.108 --> 33:13.180
He just said his first word.

33:13.215 --> 33:16.625
Oh, my god! What did he say?

33:16.660 --> 33:19.201
He called me "Mama."

33:34.048 --> 33:38.057
♪♪♪

33:44.115 --> 33:48.123
♪♪♪

33:54.180 --> 33:58.189
♪♪♪

34:35.681 --> 34:37.083
Something wrong?

34:37.119 --> 34:40.362
Elevator. It's not working.

34:40.398 --> 34:43.203
Huh. Well, no worries.

34:43.237 --> 34:45.545
I will take the tray up for you.

34:45.581 --> 34:48.119
Wait!

34:48.154 --> 34:50.061
I will take up the tray.

34:50.096 --> 34:51.496
But your leg.

34:51.532 --> 34:52.770
You shouldn't have to walk up all these stairs.

34:52.804 --> 34:54.239
It's my job.

34:54.274 --> 34:57.217
Odessa, this is silly. It's... l...

34:57.252 --> 35:00.226
you want to help me?

35:00.261 --> 35:02.100
Dust.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.610
Good morning, Alejandro.

35:15.645 --> 35:16.847
Morning, Odessa.

35:18.452 --> 35:21.429
I hope you slept well.

35:21.464 --> 35:23.637
I did.

35:23.672 --> 35:25.774
Pancakes.

35:25.809 --> 35:29.923
Well, l know how much you like them.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.392
What is this?

35:31.427 --> 35:33.367
It's nothing.

35:36.912 --> 35:40.825
Carmen! Where are you?!

35:41.894 --> 35:43.866
Carmen!

35:43.901 --> 35:45.941
Stop right there.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.319
Aah!

35:53.198 --> 35:56.508
Odessa! Are you okay?

36:52.523 --> 36:53.994
I made you French toast.

36:54.029 --> 36:56.753
Um... thanks.

36:56.788 --> 36:59.478
Anything else?

36:59.514 --> 37:02.354
No.

37:10.748 --> 37:13.088
So out of nowhere, peri says,

37:13.123 --> 37:15.763
"Tell Rosie she can see her lawyer tomorrow."

37:15.798 --> 37:18.640
Apparently, she wants to spend some quality time with our son.

37:18.675 --> 37:20.444
I was shocked.

37:20.479 --> 37:23.053
I'm not. There's one thing l know about women-

37:23.088 --> 37:27.097
Rich or poor, we all wanna be thought of as good mothers.

37:28.907 --> 37:31.514
Just say it. Say, "Mama."

37:31.549 --> 37:33.656
Oh, come on! You're not even trying!

37:36.096 --> 37:38.638
Thanks. l'Il tell him.

37:39.876 --> 37:41.612
Odessa's fine,

37:41.648 --> 37:42.918
but the doctors wanna keep her in the hospital a few days

37:42.953 --> 37:44.689
for observation.

37:44.724 --> 37:46.731
Well, just make sure she knows l'Il pay for everything.

37:46.766 --> 37:49.072
Okay. You know, including her new, uh...

37:49.107 --> 37:50.474
leg.

37:50.509 --> 37:51.847
Yeah. l'Il tell her.

38:04.087 --> 38:05.625
What's your name again?

38:05.660 --> 38:08.600
Carmen.

38:08.635 --> 38:11.009
You got a nice voice, Carmen.

38:11.044 --> 38:14.286
Oh, my God. Thank you.

38:15.691 --> 38:17.731
And if l haven't said so yet,

38:17.766 --> 38:19.069
good morning.

38:25.790 --> 38:29.768
I would like to make a toast to my wife.

38:29.803 --> 38:33.683
I know that this is going to be the best birthday l've ever had,

38:33.718 --> 38:36.375
because this will be the first birthday

38:36.410 --> 38:39.033
that l celebrate with you as my wife.

38:39.068 --> 38:40.638
Cheers. Cheers.

38:40.673 --> 38:41.841
Cheers.

38:41.876 --> 38:43.147
Marisol, you can serve the soup now.

38:45.019 --> 38:47.093
Who on earth could that be?

38:51.306 --> 38:52.877
May l help you?

38:59.097 --> 39:00.935
Olivia?

39:00.971 --> 39:03.010
I'm sorry, Mr. Stafford. She just came in.

39:03.045 --> 39:04.213
It's okay, Marisol.

39:04.248 --> 39:07.073
What-what's going on, Olivia?

39:07.108 --> 39:10.510
Brought your birthday present.

39:10.545 --> 39:13.265
Well... that's, um... very nice,

39:13.300 --> 39:15.951
but this is not a good time.

39:15.986 --> 39:19.329
guess you're having a party, huh?

39:19.365 --> 39:21.270
Michael.

39:23.342 --> 39:26.286
These are the same people we invited to your birthday

39:26.321 --> 39:29.193
last year.

39:29.229 --> 39:30.867
Of course, none of them call me anymore.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.459
I guess they're your friends now.

39:33.494 --> 39:35.982
Please do something.

39:36.017 --> 39:40.364
I was wondering what could l give you

39:40.399 --> 39:44.043
to make this important occasion?

39:44.078 --> 39:46.317
And l found this...

39:46.352 --> 39:49.243
crystal heart.

39:49.278 --> 39:52.136
Isn't it lovely?

39:54.275 --> 39:57.955
But please be careful with it. Okay?

39:57.990 --> 39:59.761
Because...

40:01.432 --> 40:03.506
I gave you my heart once before...

40:03.541 --> 40:05.981
and you broke it.

40:08.255 --> 40:12.400
Didn't you, Michael?

40:12.435 --> 40:14.105
Didn't you?!

40:14.140 --> 40:16.111
Okay, that's it. You're done. Get off of me!

40:16.146 --> 40:20.155
Do not screw with me, bitch, or you will live to regret it.

40:21.197 --> 40:25.108
Michael. You wanna talk about how unfair life is,

40:25.143 --> 40:29.021
well, that's great, 'cause l know all about that.

40:29.056 --> 40:30.359
Do you wanna hear what l've lost?

40:30.394 --> 40:32.363
How l've suffered?

40:32.399 --> 40:36.161
Of course not. 'cause to people like you,

40:36.196 --> 40:39.923
I'm just the woman who opens the door.

40:50.424 --> 40:53.534
I worked really hard on this dinner.

40:53.569 --> 40:56.644
I'Il be damned if l let anyone ruin it.

41:15.137 --> 41:16.541
Marisol.

41:19.083 --> 41:22.427
You have a job here for as long as you want one.

41:34.165 --> 41:35.602
Well...

41:35.637 --> 41:38.043
tonight was a triumph for you.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.285
I did put on a bit of a show. Mm-hmm.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.492
We've never seen a maid quite like you.

41:42.527 --> 41:44.348
Well...

41:44.383 --> 41:46.135
thank you.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.375
in fact, l'm fairly sure

41:47.410 --> 41:49.446
you're not a maid.

41:49.481 --> 41:53.762
And l can't wait to find out what you're really doing here.

42:06.637 --> 42:09.579
Marisol!

42:30.647 --> 42:33.222
Hey, how are you doing?

42:33.257 --> 42:37.134
not good.

42:37.169 --> 42:39.208
I wanna get outta here, mom.

42:41.348 --> 42:43.455
I'm working on it, baby.

42:43.490 --> 42:45.428
I'm working on it.
