Beauty & the Beast...

00:02.825 --> 00:04.026
<i>You had Windsor's heart</i>

00:04.059 --> 00:05.160
<i>in your hand.</i>

00:05.194 --> 00:06.561
Why would someone want

00:06.595 --> 00:08.063
<i>a gem that controls beasts?</i>

00:08.096 --> 00:09.297
<i>He is a beast</i>

00:09.332 --> 00:10.132
<i>and he always will be.</i>

00:10.166 --> 00:11.166
He is not gonna change.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.534
He has already changed.

00:12.568 --> 00:14.301
Don't be so naive, Catherine.

00:14.336 --> 00:15.703
I won't let
him hurt you.

00:15.738 --> 00:17.539
I love you, Catherine.

00:17.573 --> 00:19.306
I love you, too.

00:24.613 --> 00:25.713
We're looking
for Vincent Keller.

00:25.748 --> 00:27.348
You're under arrest.
For what?

00:27.382 --> 00:28.349
The murder of Curt Windsor.

00:28.383 --> 00:29.183
I think there's been a mistake.

00:29.217 --> 00:30.551
Vincent.
Don't worry.

00:30.585 --> 00:31.718
I'll be fine.

00:42.864 --> 00:45.066
Wait, Detective!

00:45.100 --> 00:47.034
I know you have
a warrant,

00:47.068 --> 00:48.398
but there are
extenuating circumstances.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.235
He can't be taken in.

00:49.236 --> 00:51.538
He doesn't have a choice.
He didn't do this.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.773
Tori Windsor's
kidnappers--

00:52.807 --> 00:54.174
they killed Windsor.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.043
We have new evidence
that says otherwise.

00:56.077 --> 00:58.244
What? Like... What do you have?
Catherine, I'm fine. Okay?

00:58.279 --> 01:00.513
Okay, but it's the weekend,
and the courts aren't open till Monday,

01:00.548 --> 01:02.215
which means you'll be locked
in... I was talking to him.

01:02.249 --> 01:03.716
I think you need
to calm down.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.452
Calm down?
- Wait, Catherine.

01:05.486 --> 01:06.419
Catherine.

01:06.454 --> 01:07.753
What?
- The gem.

01:07.788 --> 01:08.788
The gem.

01:08.822 --> 01:10.290
Get me the gem.

01:10.324 --> 01:12.225
Oh, my God, the gem.
Where is it?

01:21.668 --> 01:24.470
It's your partner.

01:24.504 --> 01:26.305
She's calling you?

01:26.339 --> 01:28.140
She doesn't know
that I'm here, does she?

01:28.174 --> 01:30.810
Well, I posted that photo of
you in my bed on Instagram,

01:30.844 --> 01:33.479
but... I'm not
gonna say anything.

01:33.513 --> 01:35.581
It was one night. It's
not like we're a couple.

01:35.615 --> 01:37.382
Besides, she's probably
calling to gush

01:37.417 --> 01:39.384
about her sex life,
not ask about mine.

01:39.419 --> 01:41.153
Hello.

01:41.187 --> 01:43.322
JT, the gem that keeps Vincent
from beasting out,

01:43.356 --> 01:45.424
where is it?
Why? You want to...

01:45.458 --> 01:47.759
control the beast
in the bedroom?

01:47.793 --> 01:49.561
No, he's been arrested

01:49.596 --> 01:51.930
for Curt Windsor's murder.
What?

01:51.964 --> 01:52.997
Yeah. And I-I think

01:53.022 --> 01:55.000
- What happened?
- that-that Gabe turned him in.

01:55.001 --> 01:56.322
Vincent's been arrested
for murder

01:56.335 --> 01:57.969
and Gabe turned him in?

01:58.004 --> 01:59.570
I broke up with him last night

01:59.605 --> 02:01.339
to be with Vincent, and now...

02:01.373 --> 02:02.841
You broke up last night?

02:02.875 --> 02:04.342
Can you stop repeating
everything?

02:04.376 --> 02:06.244
Vincent needs the gem.
Where is it?

02:06.278 --> 02:07.083
I have no idea.

02:07.108 --> 02:08.779
Think about
where he might have hidden it.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.981
In the meantime, I'm gonna try
and intercept his lab work.

02:11.015 --> 02:11.965
What lab work?

02:11.990 --> 02:13.684
They're booking him,
which means they're gonna

02:13.685 --> 02:15.620
check his DNA.
DNA?

02:15.654 --> 02:17.121
He'll be exposed.
I know.

02:17.156 --> 02:19.290
Just worry about the gem.
I got to go.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.593
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

02:22.628 --> 02:24.362
Police business.

02:24.396 --> 02:25.996
Hi. Detective
Chandler.

02:26.031 --> 02:28.265
I-I have
a perp in back.

02:28.299 --> 02:30.768
Badge?
- Right. Um...

02:30.802 --> 02:33.137
Okay, I know that I had it.

02:33.171 --> 02:35.172
Um...
Oh, my God.

02:35.206 --> 02:39.276
I must've... Okay, I know
I don't look the part right now,

02:39.310 --> 02:41.178
but I had an emergency
this morning. I'm stationed

02:41.212 --> 02:43.346
at the 125th. I need
to get into Intake.

02:43.381 --> 02:45.982
Sorry, lady, no badge, no budge.

02:48.186 --> 02:49.118
Can I help
you, ma'am?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.992
This is Lowan.

02:56.026 --> 02:57.561
You son of a bitch.

02:57.595 --> 02:58.995
You got the wrong number.

02:59.029 --> 03:01.530
No, I don't have
the wrong number, Gabe.

03:01.565 --> 03:03.733
We're supposed
to be looking for the gem.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.635
It's not here. He buried it
somewhere. I never trusted you,

03:06.670 --> 03:08.571
but even I can't believe
you'd stoop this low.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.573
Wait, what are you talking about?
It's Cat.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.008
Oh, please, don't
play dumb with me.

03:12.042 --> 03:13.810
Shh, she doesn't know I'm here.

03:13.844 --> 03:15.977
Hey, what's going on?
Long story. I'm at the 95th

03:16.012 --> 03:17.313
and I can't find my badge.
And since you're, like,

03:17.347 --> 03:18.681
five minutes away,
can you come down here

03:18.715 --> 03:20.182
and vouch for me?
If anything happens

03:20.217 --> 03:22.585
to him in there, it is on you.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.853
Happens to who?
They took him to the 95th?

03:24.887 --> 03:27.189
Yeah, and I got to get him out
before... Wait, you heard?

03:27.224 --> 03:29.825
Uh, yeah, JT texted me,
but I'm-I'm not at home.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.193
I'm at the gym.
You don't get your ass to the 95th,

03:31.227 --> 03:33.528
Who is that?
wave your magic ADA wand

03:33.562 --> 03:34.830
Just a crazy trainer in the background.
and undo this ASAP,

03:34.864 --> 03:36.664
you're gonna have
to answer to me.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.399
<i>That's even better.</i>

03:38.434 --> 03:39.735
Isn't your gym
around the corner?

03:39.769 --> 03:41.737
Actually, I changed gyms.

03:41.771 --> 03:43.538
I'd ask the detective
who arrested Vincent

03:43.572 --> 03:44.740
to vouch for me,
but he doesn't want me here.

03:44.774 --> 03:46.574
He almost arrested me.

03:46.609 --> 03:48.509
So what are you gonna do when
you get in there, wear a mask?

03:48.544 --> 03:50.811
Yeah, you're right.
I am in my pajamas.

03:52.781 --> 03:54.682
Okay, I've got an idea. Bring me

03:54.717 --> 03:57.585
my old uniform or yours
as soon as you can.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.920
- I got to get to the 95th.
- I'm coming.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.522
Oh, we're gonna go together?

04:01.557 --> 04:03.791
You're seriously
asking me that now?

04:03.825 --> 04:06.227
No, I...
Just drop me off a block away.

04:08.563 --> 04:09.630
<i>Left.</i>

04:09.664 --> 04:12.466
Right. Forward.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.268
Strip.

04:14.302 --> 04:16.870
Everything off. Put it in here.

04:16.904 --> 04:19.606
Aren't you that war hero?

04:19.641 --> 04:20.906
Yeah.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.443
How the mighty fall.

04:23.478 --> 04:26.280
Everything off. Now.

04:31.286 --> 04:32.753
Uh, excuse me.
Can you buzz me in?

04:32.787 --> 04:34.288
I want to go use the restroom.

04:34.322 --> 04:35.789
It's the other way.
That one's occupied.

04:35.823 --> 04:38.224
I was hoping to use
the women's locker room.

04:38.259 --> 04:39.759
That one's
for officers.

04:39.794 --> 04:41.094
With badges.

04:42.429 --> 04:46.065
Okay. Okay, fine. How about...

04:46.100 --> 04:50.003
you FaceTime with my partner,
she'll show you her badge

04:50.037 --> 04:52.038
and she can confirm my identity.

04:53.674 --> 04:55.508
I got a potential 10-50
out here who's armed.

04:55.542 --> 04:58.778
No, I-I'm not a 10-50.
I'm not a psych patient,

04:58.812 --> 05:01.246
and this, this is
an NYPD-registered weapon.

05:01.281 --> 05:03.248
Need restraints
and backup.

05:03.283 --> 05:04.983
<i>Bend over.</i>

05:05.018 --> 05:06.786
Look, I don't have anything
on me, okay?

05:06.820 --> 05:08.100
Just put your hands
on your head.

05:10.489 --> 05:11.389
Turn around.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.294
It's at a press conference,
125th.

05:15.328 --> 05:16.761
As you can see,
my name is underneath,

05:16.796 --> 05:19.031
Detective Chandler.
This her?

05:19.065 --> 05:21.867
Yes, Detective
Chandler.

05:21.901 --> 05:24.303
See what I mean?
All right, let's go.

05:24.337 --> 05:26.305
What is going on here?
She's a detective.

05:26.339 --> 05:27.872
Gabe, I need
to get back there.

05:27.906 --> 05:29.974
ADA Lowan.
Let her back now.

05:30.008 --> 05:31.976
Excuse me.

05:34.413 --> 05:36.548
What's going on now?

05:36.582 --> 05:39.718
Just gonna draw some blood, do DNA.
- DNA? No.

05:39.752 --> 05:41.986
I'm afraid of needles.
It's not gonna hurt.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.155
I have a very serious phobia.
I can't.

05:44.189 --> 05:45.556
How is this not clear yet, okay?

05:45.590 --> 05:46.824
Nothing in here is optional.

05:46.859 --> 05:48.525
Give her your arm.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.804
No!

06:00.839 --> 06:04.118
- I need backup. Now!

What?

06:23.280 --> 06:24.681
What are you doing?

06:24.715 --> 06:27.016
Changing.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.652
So you think I did this, too?

06:30.687 --> 06:32.528
Doesn't matter  what I think.
It matters to me.

06:32.556 --> 06:34.523
I would never do something
like this-- it's not

06:34.558 --> 06:36.725
who I am or how I operate.
Yeah, just that

06:36.759 --> 06:39.061
last night you said
you'd do anything to protect me

06:39.096 --> 06:40.996
from Vincent
and now he's incarcerated.

06:41.030 --> 06:43.665
Yes, the timing is coincidental,
and I do think you're making

06:43.700 --> 06:46.268
a big mistake going back to him,
but I don't want to win you back

06:46.303 --> 06:48.770
like this. I want to do it
on an even playing field.

06:48.805 --> 06:50.235
Are we really having
a relationship talk right now?

06:50.260 --> 06:52.240
Look, I just need you to know

06:52.241 --> 06:53.909
that this wasn't me.
And will do whatever I can

06:53.943 --> 06:55.176
to prove it to you.

06:55.211 --> 06:57.479
Can you get the charges dropped?

06:58.881 --> 07:00.983
I have to go to Intake.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.018
Okay, we're gonna
take him on three.

07:08.257 --> 07:10.091
- Three!
- Hey.

07:10.126 --> 07:11.692
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:11.727 --> 07:13.294
- He's good.
- The hell you doing?

07:13.329 --> 07:16.030
Flannery sent me. I'm good
at talking prisoners down.

07:16.064 --> 07:19.033
Sir, I know this can be scary,
but it won't hurt.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.268
And, when the tests are done,
I will personally

07:21.302 --> 07:24.105
carry the samples to the lab,
easy peasy.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.240
Mr. Keller, is it?
Yeah.

07:26.274 --> 07:28.375
Would you like to take a seat
over there?

07:29.511 --> 07:30.911
You can come back.

07:32.472 --> 07:33.112
Close.

07:33.839 --> 07:35.920
Let's just do
a little visualization.

07:36.317 --> 07:38.985
Talk about what makes you
feel calm. Is it...

07:39.020 --> 07:43.123
the sound of the ocean,
a sunset, a special gem?

07:43.158 --> 07:46.960
Just tell me where it is
in your mind.

07:46.994 --> 07:48.728
Is it
on a tropical island?

07:48.763 --> 07:51.165
A houseboat? A dungeon?

07:51.199 --> 07:53.900
My bliss is not
in a dungeon.

07:53.934 --> 07:56.903
And even if I told someone where
it was, it's not like they could

07:56.937 --> 07:58.298
get it for me.
- She's not actually

07:58.305 --> 07:59.773
gonna bring you your bliss,
dumb-ass.

07:59.807 --> 08:01.775
They could get
in a lot of trouble.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.943
Yeah, but you could get in
even more trouble if you don't

08:03.978 --> 08:06.240
stay calm, which isn't easy
to do in here.

08:06.265 --> 08:07.480
Well, he can

08:07.481 --> 08:10.249
refrain from sharing.
No more needles.

08:10.284 --> 08:12.818
- Scary part's over.
- No, it's not.

08:12.852 --> 08:15.488
I'm not gonna stop asking
until you tell me and that could

08:15.522 --> 08:16.556
get me in trouble.

08:17.857 --> 08:18.558
Open up.

08:21.861 --> 08:22.995
Your brother's headstone?

08:24.231 --> 08:26.098
I'm very intuitive.

08:26.132 --> 08:28.300
I will take those
to the lab.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.669
Thank you.
- Open.

08:32.905 --> 08:35.207
<i>Hey, it's Lowan.</i>

08:35.241 --> 08:37.042
Listen, rumor has it
that you're running point

08:37.077 --> 08:38.811
on the Vincent Keller case.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.979
Gabe, where's Cat?

08:41.014 --> 08:42.251
Call me back
as soon as you can.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.610
And why do you
have her clothes?

08:43.635 --> 08:44.511
Hey.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.352
Where's JT?
- I don't know.

08:47.386 --> 08:49.454
Why would I know?
Is he okay?

08:49.488 --> 08:51.223
He's freaking out, but...
I think he's talking about Vincent.

08:51.257 --> 08:53.825
Sorry. I took a cab.
They dropped me off blocks away

08:53.859 --> 08:55.627
for some stupid reason.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.295
You still have your morgue credentials?
- Yeah, but, uh,

08:57.330 --> 08:59.330
we haven't found the gem yet.
- I know where it is.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.664
Tess and I will
go get it.

09:00.699 --> 09:02.867
I need you to swap out
these samples,

09:02.901 --> 09:04.235
get him some normal bloodwork
and DNA.

09:04.269 --> 09:05.803
What's going on
with the charges?

09:05.838 --> 09:07.905
I left word for
the ADA on the case.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.841
Playing both sides? Nice.
I didn't do this.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.809
Gabe didn't do this.
Really? Is that what he told you?

09:11.844 --> 09:14.245
JT...
If it wasn't him, who was it?

09:14.279 --> 09:16.647
Pointing fingers doesn't help.
No, but dropping me off a block away

09:16.681 --> 09:18.382
so no one knows
we slept together does?

09:22.587 --> 09:24.154
Um....

09:24.188 --> 09:26.490
I'm gonna draw my own blood.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.225
<i>Sorry I didn't say</i>
<i>anything on the phone.</i>

09:28.260 --> 09:31.094
It just felt a little off-topic.
No, it's okay.

09:31.129 --> 09:32.929
Vincent didn't tell me
which brother, so I guess

09:32.964 --> 09:35.044
we each take one and start
shoveling around the base.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.902
Just so you know,
it was only two times.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.603
Us, sleeping together.
I'm not judging.

09:40.638 --> 09:42.505
Just keep shoveling.

09:42.539 --> 09:44.941
So what's the plan? I mean,
say we find this thing.

09:44.976 --> 09:46.609
We're finding it.

09:46.644 --> 09:48.578
And then what, he'll wear
a necklace in jail? I mean...

09:48.612 --> 09:49.636
We'll take it off the chain.

09:49.661 --> 09:51.489
And then what? Sew it
into his jumpsuit?

09:51.982 --> 09:54.584
You know, they make 'em change every day.
Prisoners have contraband

09:54.618 --> 09:56.352
all the time. I'm sure
we can figure out some way

09:56.387 --> 09:57.754
for him to hide one little gem.

09:57.788 --> 10:01.391
It's not that little.
Can you please stop?

10:01.425 --> 10:02.725
I get you and JT
are having issues,

10:02.760 --> 10:04.260
but this is
worst-case scenario.

10:04.295 --> 10:06.962
There is no room for doubt.
I wasn't doubting...

10:06.997 --> 10:08.898
He could lose
control, be outed,

10:08.932 --> 10:11.733
he could kill somebody.
Okay, we'll get him the gem.

10:11.768 --> 10:13.368
We'll say
it's for religious beliefs.

10:13.403 --> 10:15.871
They can't argue with religion.
Okay, even if we do,

10:15.906 --> 10:19.374
there are gonna be depositions,
trials, talking to lawyers.

10:19.409 --> 10:21.110
Gabe'll get you a great lawyer.
Yeah, well, he better

10:21.144 --> 10:22.778
because Vincent did this.
He killed Curt Windsor.

10:22.812 --> 10:24.613
He ripped his heart out.

10:24.647 --> 10:26.080
He could get a life sentence.

10:26.115 --> 10:27.616
I don't know if he
could survive that.

10:27.650 --> 10:29.818
I don't know if I could.

10:29.852 --> 10:32.654
You know, we finally just found
our way back to each other, and now...

10:32.689 --> 10:34.989
And now you're both
incredibly strong.

10:35.024 --> 10:36.591
You can survive anything.

10:36.626 --> 10:38.659
And yeah, you just
got back together, but...

10:38.694 --> 10:42.163
you're not some fragile
newbie couple, you're epic.

10:42.198 --> 10:43.631
And I'm sorry, you know, this...

10:43.665 --> 10:46.067
this wasn't about
my issues with JT,

10:46.101 --> 10:47.568
it's just that he and my

10:47.602 --> 10:49.437
best friend would be devastated

10:49.471 --> 10:50.972
if anything ever
happened to Vincent,

10:51.006 --> 10:52.841
a-and I don't know
how to help.

10:52.875 --> 10:56.577
Look, I think that
you already did.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.078
There's something in there.

10:58.112 --> 10:59.012
Oh, my God.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.981
What is that?

11:03.184 --> 11:05.419
Money, cell
phone, passport, gem.

11:05.454 --> 11:07.755
It's even smaller
than I remember.

11:09.791 --> 11:10.991
It's Gabe.

11:11.025 --> 11:12.659
Hey, what's going on?

11:12.693 --> 11:15.195
They have pictures of Vincent
dumping Windsor's body.

11:15.230 --> 11:16.864
They were sent
anonymously

11:16.898 --> 11:19.266
to the DA's office. You
remember his body was

11:19.300 --> 11:21.301
found in a alley?
Vincent obviously

11:21.336 --> 11:22.469
moved the body from JT's.

11:22.503 --> 11:23.703
You know, these don't

11:23.738 --> 11:25.138
actually prove anything.

11:25.173 --> 11:26.773
It's not of the murder.

11:26.807 --> 11:28.007
We could argue

11:28.041 --> 11:29.275
Vincent was being
a Good Samaritan.

11:29.309 --> 11:31.644
He found a mortally
injured Windsor,

11:31.679 --> 11:33.680
and he tried to help.
But he couldn't come forward

11:33.714 --> 11:35.181
because he had amnesia
at the time.

11:35.215 --> 11:36.383
He was suffering
with PTSD.

11:36.417 --> 11:37.784
He couldn't report it.

11:37.818 --> 11:39.452
You really could've
been a lawyer.

11:39.487 --> 11:41.287
And then we could
bolster our theory with

11:41.321 --> 11:43.956
he was a war hero,

11:43.991 --> 11:45.824
he saved Windsor's daughter
Tori from kidnapping.

11:45.825 --> 11:46.325
Cat.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.826
Okay, maybe we
don't mention Tori.

11:47.827 --> 11:51.730
They found Windsor's
heart in Vincent's fridge.

11:51.765 --> 11:52.999
What?

11:53.033 --> 11:55.034
They used the photos
to obtain a warrant,

11:55.068 --> 11:57.636
they searched his boat last night.
Okay, but Windsor's heart

11:57.670 --> 11:59.490
wasn't in Vincent's fridge
or anywhere on his boat.

11:59.515 --> 12:01.339
So what, someone put it there?

12:01.340 --> 12:03.542
Someone is setting him up.
Well, where did they get the heart?

12:03.576 --> 12:05.377
I don't know. But you,
me and Tori were the only ones

12:05.412 --> 12:06.852
who were there when he
killed him. And Tori's dead.

12:06.877 --> 12:08.280
Whoa,

12:08.281 --> 12:10.682
for the record, I have not
been holding onto organs

12:10.717 --> 12:12.984
in case you and Vincent
get back together.

12:13.019 --> 12:15.186
No, you're right.

12:15.221 --> 12:18.356
But he had a handler
at the time, who would.

12:22.228 --> 12:24.229
A heart in his fridge?

12:24.263 --> 12:25.763
Well how would I manage
that from in jail?

12:25.798 --> 12:28.400
By paying someone off,
like you always do.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.867
Oh, you give me way
too much credit.

12:29.902 --> 12:31.502
I don't think so, Dad.
I was here

12:31.537 --> 12:33.271
a couple weeks ago,
I told you I was working with

12:33.306 --> 12:35.606
Vincent and you were
concerned for my safety.

12:35.641 --> 12:37.842
You were being a protective
father, that's all.

12:37.876 --> 12:41.078
Why don't you just admit it,
and we can move on.

12:41.112 --> 12:44.048
All right.

12:44.082 --> 12:45.349
'Cause then you'd
have my confession

12:45.383 --> 12:46.751
recorded on your cell phone?

12:50.088 --> 12:52.289
I will admit to one thing.

12:52.324 --> 12:54.791
I'm very happy that Vincent's
finally where he belongs.

12:54.826 --> 12:56.060
In a cage.

12:56.094 --> 12:57.627
You'll never
get away with this.

12:57.662 --> 12:59.563
You can fight it all you
want, but you and Vincent,

12:59.597 --> 13:02.399
it's over.
- No, it's not.

13:02.434 --> 13:03.767
No matter what happens,

13:03.801 --> 13:05.602
No matter where we are,
we will survive.

13:05.636 --> 13:07.771
Well,
we'll see about that,

13:07.805 --> 13:11.708
because he's about to go
away for a long, long time.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.738
Hey, pretty boy.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.009
Keller. Let's go.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.923
Hi, I'm Dr. Forbes.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.159
In the chair.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.028
Hello, Dr. Forbes.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.133
There were some issues
with your last blood draw,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.501
so we got to redo it.
And since I hear

13:56.535 --> 13:57.970
you've got a little
needle anxiety,

13:58.004 --> 14:00.906
just want to be on
the safe side.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.440
Hey. You Miller?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.409
Yeah.
Vargas from IA.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.511
Need to talk to you about
that strip search case.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.647
Sounds like you need
to take care of that,

14:08.681 --> 14:11.949
but, uh, we're good
here, aren't we?

14:11.984 --> 14:13.217
Yeah, we're good.

14:23.061 --> 14:25.163
What the hell is going on?
- We're gonna stick

14:25.197 --> 14:26.764
this under your bandage.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.132
She found it.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.201
Wait, what bandage?

14:30.235 --> 14:31.502
From the blood draw.

14:31.536 --> 14:32.870
And I've got
new blood samples

14:32.905 --> 14:35.139
to swap in. You're
an Ashkenazi Jew, but...

14:35.174 --> 14:37.374
Are you out of your
mind? You used yours?

14:37.409 --> 14:40.277
JT, they're gonna run it
through the criminal database,

14:40.312 --> 14:42.346
your DNA is gonna be on file now.
- So?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.181
I'm not planning on
getting arrested, too.

14:44.215 --> 14:45.482
So, this could
get you arrested.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.617
Then they're gonna
cross-reference,

14:46.651 --> 14:47.851
and figure out that now

14:47.885 --> 14:49.353
you've been charged
with murder.

14:49.387 --> 14:51.789
And you got Tess in on it as well?
- Actually,

14:51.823 --> 14:54.725
Cat has Tess in on this,
she'll barely be seen with me.

14:54.759 --> 14:56.293
But don't worry,
the, uh, strip search

14:56.327 --> 14:57.994
investigation
she's following up on

14:58.029 --> 14:59.395
is totally legit.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.864
Tess is not IA, okay?

15:00.898 --> 15:03.466
This is completely
illegal. You...

15:03.500 --> 15:04.567
You're taking so many risks.

15:04.601 --> 15:06.236
Left and right.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.039
We're here for you, buddy.
No,

15:09.073 --> 15:10.173
No, no more, okay?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.641
This is it.
- Please,

15:11.675 --> 15:12.908
there's still
a boatload to do,

15:12.943 --> 15:14.477
and Cat's on top of it.

15:14.511 --> 15:16.379
She's even got Gabe
going through evidence from

15:16.413 --> 15:18.514
the opposing side with her.
Okay, again, totally illegal.

15:18.549 --> 15:19.915
What are they gonna
do with it, shred it?

15:19.950 --> 15:21.351
Come on man,
let's face it,

15:21.385 --> 15:22.518
I killed the guy.
- Shh.

15:22.553 --> 15:24.654
In your apartment.

15:24.688 --> 15:27.323
Look, this thing goes to trial,
they reopen the case.

15:27.358 --> 15:29.524
They investigate.
They'll find out

15:29.559 --> 15:30.993
where it happened,
they'll find out that

15:31.027 --> 15:33.028
Catherine has covered
everything up.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.730
What are you saying?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.369
That I can't let that happen.

15:40.403 --> 15:42.571
Hey, JT get the gem?
He did.

15:42.605 --> 15:44.106
Oh, you guys are together.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.207
Uh, not like that.

15:46.242 --> 15:48.910
Uh, I put those blues
back in the locker.

15:48.944 --> 15:50.945
And I swapped out the labs.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.781
Great, I'm heading to the
houseboat to dust for prints.

15:52.815 --> 15:55.950
I think my father
paid someone off

15:55.985 --> 15:57.452
to put Windsor's heart
in Vincent's fridge.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.454
Yeah.
Wait, what?

15:59.489 --> 16:02.190
That's who's behind this,
not Gabe.

16:02.224 --> 16:03.391
So if you can hack
into Reynolds' financials,

16:03.425 --> 16:04.725
see if there are
any recent withdrawals.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.427
If we can prove
this was a frame job,

16:06.461 --> 16:07.695
the evidence
will be inadmissible.

16:07.729 --> 16:09.330
Great, but we only have
about 36 hours.

16:10.832 --> 16:12.700
What's in 36 hours?
The arraignment.

16:12.734 --> 16:15.003
I think Vincent's
gonna plead guilty.

16:20.609 --> 16:22.109
No, you're not.

16:22.143 --> 16:23.577
Catherine,
I am not dragging you all

16:23.612 --> 16:25.546
into some drawn out trial.
I talked to JT.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.048
First of all, there doesn't
even have to be a trial

16:28.082 --> 16:29.483
if we can
get the charges dropped.

16:29.518 --> 16:32.052
Second, I thought you
were done protecting me.

16:32.086 --> 16:34.288
I am sick of all the men
in my life doing that.

16:34.322 --> 16:35.455
You realize that's why

16:35.489 --> 16:36.556
you're in here, right?

16:36.590 --> 16:37.991
Because my father

16:38.026 --> 16:39.393
planted evidence in order

16:39.427 --> 16:41.328
to protect me from you,

16:41.362 --> 16:42.896
which brings me to third,

16:42.931 --> 16:45.598
if you plead
guilty, he wins.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.635
No, if I plead guilty,
I get a shorter sentence.

16:48.669 --> 16:52.405
They'll still keep you
in here for 20, 25 years.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.240
I like older women.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.207
Vincent.

16:56.977 --> 17:00.413
Look, I can't ask you
to wait, okay,

17:00.448 --> 17:02.582
but for me, nothing changes.

17:02.616 --> 17:04.517
Catherine, I love you.

17:04.551 --> 17:06.352
And I love you, too, but...

17:06.386 --> 17:08.154
But what,
you're worried that...

17:08.188 --> 17:11.757
You don't think
we'll survive this, huh?

17:11.790 --> 17:14.760
I didn't say that.

17:14.794 --> 17:17.262
Look, I know that you don't want
to be protected,

17:17.297 --> 17:18.696
but you also made
it very clear

17:18.731 --> 17:20.433
that you need to move forward
with your life,

17:20.467 --> 17:22.501
and risking everything
for me,

17:22.535 --> 17:25.369
sacrificing everything for me
is not moving forward.

17:25.404 --> 17:28.874
You're just... you're gonna
end up resenting me.

17:28.908 --> 17:30.208
What about you,

17:30.242 --> 17:32.177
locked up in there
all that time?

17:32.211 --> 17:34.145
I will be fine, okay?

17:34.180 --> 17:36.047
I have the gem.

17:36.082 --> 17:37.649
I'll get out
on good behavior.

17:37.684 --> 17:39.084
Good behavior?

17:40.720 --> 17:43.121
You're really gonna do this.

17:47.426 --> 17:48.994
Fine.

17:49.028 --> 17:51.296
I'm telling the DA
that I was a witness,

17:51.330 --> 17:52.530
that this was self-defense.

17:52.564 --> 17:54.299
Come on, no, you cannot do that.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.034
That is admitting
to a cover up.

17:56.068 --> 17:57.535
You'll face
criminal charges.

17:57.569 --> 17:59.303
One good thing
about you being in there

17:59.337 --> 18:02.339
is that you can't stop me.

18:03.575 --> 18:06.076
And I love you,

18:06.111 --> 18:09.313
no but.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.663
Yeah!

18:37.975 --> 18:39.776
Wait, you want to come forward
about everything everything?

18:39.810 --> 18:41.011
No, not about beasts,

18:41.045 --> 18:42.679
just about my part,

18:42.713 --> 18:45.015
that I was a witness,
it was self-defense.

18:45.049 --> 18:47.216
Vincent was arrested
in your apartment.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.419
It is not a huge leap
to you two are together.

18:49.453 --> 18:50.653
The prosecution is gonna argue

18:50.654 --> 18:52.255
that you are fabricating
some story

18:52.289 --> 18:54.290
to protect your boyfriend.
But I didn't,

18:54.324 --> 18:55.925
and you know that.
You were there.

18:57.827 --> 18:59.262
Look, don't look at me
like that.

18:59.296 --> 19:02.031
Like what?
Like you want me to corroborate.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.099
What? No.
They will point out

19:04.133 --> 19:06.468
that we were together, too.
Although,

19:06.502 --> 19:08.537
wouldn't that be helpful?

19:08.572 --> 19:10.305
Why would Vincent's rival

19:10.339 --> 19:13.075
come to his defense
unless it was the truth?

19:13.109 --> 19:14.276
I could lose my job.

19:14.310 --> 19:15.431
Wait, I'm not asking you to.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.545
You could, too.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.813
Maybe,

19:17.847 --> 19:19.414
but I could say that

19:19.449 --> 19:20.549
I didn't come forward earlier

19:20.583 --> 19:21.950
because I was protecting Tori

19:21.984 --> 19:23.385
from finding out
that her father

19:23.419 --> 19:24.719
was a lunatic, or...

19:24.753 --> 19:25.920
You're looking at me again.

19:25.955 --> 19:27.755
It's just...

19:27.790 --> 19:29.558
Gabe, it's the truth.

19:29.592 --> 19:31.893
And we took an oath

19:31.927 --> 19:33.595
that we have broken a lot,

19:33.629 --> 19:35.630
and this could be our chance
to do the right thing.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.468
Okay, forget that I asked.

19:40.502 --> 19:42.470
I just came here to find out
who I should talk to.

19:42.504 --> 19:44.472
Do I need my own lawyer, or...

19:44.506 --> 19:46.608
Catherine, you are
confessing to a crime.

19:46.642 --> 19:48.175
Yes, you need a lawyer.

19:48.210 --> 19:50.011
I will get you a good one.

19:50.045 --> 19:51.278
Thank you.

19:51.313 --> 19:53.247
And I-I'm sorry

19:53.281 --> 19:54.815
that I keep dragging you
into my melodrama.

19:54.849 --> 19:56.250
I did say I would do anything
to help.

19:56.284 --> 19:57.618
To level the playing field,

19:57.652 --> 20:00.287
not hurl yourself
over the bleachers.

20:09.498 --> 20:11.297
Hey.

20:11.332 --> 20:12.766
What are you doing?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.103
It's just hard to breathe,
you know?

20:16.137 --> 20:17.938
How much longer
to the hospital?

20:17.972 --> 20:19.773
Just sit tight.

20:21.575 --> 20:23.176
What was that? You hear that?

20:23.210 --> 20:24.277
What is that?

20:30.584 --> 20:31.784
What's that?!

20:38.892 --> 20:40.960
EMS transfer requesting backup.

20:50.503 --> 20:52.038
Detective Chandler?

20:52.072 --> 20:53.372
Oh, Gloria,

20:53.406 --> 20:55.074
thank you for meeting
on a weekend.

20:55.108 --> 20:56.742
Well, it sounds
like an interesting case.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.310
Can I get you a coffee?

20:58.344 --> 20:59.744
Oh.
- I'll take one.

20:59.779 --> 21:01.413
Gabe.

21:01.447 --> 21:04.650
Just trying to even the
playing field. Hey, Gloria.

21:04.684 --> 21:06.652
You don't have to.
It's the right thing to do.

21:08.521 --> 21:11.323
It's my partner.
Just a second.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.891
Hey.

21:14.394 --> 21:16.695
What? Oh, my God.

21:16.729 --> 21:18.163
Uh, can you change it
to the news?

21:18.197 --> 21:19.964
- Sure.
- What's going on?

21:21.633 --> 21:23.768
...manhunt is currently underway

21:23.803 --> 21:26.004
in Manhattan
and surrounding boroughs

21:26.038 --> 21:28.740
as the NYPD searches
for Vincent Keller...

21:28.774 --> 21:31.576
Isn't that who we're meeting about?
We're going to have to postpone.

21:31.610 --> 21:33.690
Keller was being held
on suspicion for the vicious...

21:34.306 --> 21:36.378
I Thought you said JT
bandage the gem to it.

21:36.403 --> 21:37.042
He Did.

21:37.043 --> 21:38.711
Then how'd he rip open
the ambulance?

21:38.745 --> 21:40.479
What was he even doing
in there? An ambulance?

21:40.513 --> 21:42.314
He must have been hurt.
What if somebody saw something?

21:42.349 --> 21:43.681
I'm with the DA's office.
I'm with him.

21:43.716 --> 21:45.516
Why don't you go
into the ambulance,

21:45.551 --> 21:46.852
see if you can any clues
to what happened

21:46.886 --> 21:48.253
or where Vincent
might have gone?

21:48.287 --> 21:50.655
I'll be right there.
Detective Flannery,

21:50.689 --> 21:52.891
I told you, extenuating
circumstances.

21:52.925 --> 21:54.392
He never should have been in that cell.
- Look who it is.

21:54.426 --> 21:56.228
What did they do to him?
- They?

21:56.262 --> 21:58.196
Your guards, the prisoners.
He never would have

21:58.231 --> 21:59.864
tried to run unless
they had done something.

21:59.898 --> 22:02.199
Your boyfriend instigated
a fight in jail. As far as

22:02.234 --> 22:04.335
my guards, they were doing their
job until he attacked them.

22:04.370 --> 22:06.203
I've got one with such a
bad head injury over there,

22:06.238 --> 22:08.399
he's having hallucinations.
We got a statewide manhunt.

22:08.407 --> 22:09.741
Wait. Hallucinations?
Who? Which guard?

22:09.775 --> 22:12.443
The one in
the <i>undamaged</i> ambulance.

22:12.478 --> 22:14.846
Excuse me.
- We'll be seeing you soon enough.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.247
I just got a warrant
to search your place.

22:17.983 --> 22:19.950
I searched the ambulance.
There's no sign

22:19.985 --> 22:21.752
of the gem, but I
did find something.

22:21.786 --> 22:23.453
That guard saw Vincent
as a beast.

22:23.488 --> 22:25.522
I'm gonna go
do damage control,

22:25.556 --> 22:27.724
but the press is gonna be
swarming this place, and you are

22:27.759 --> 22:29.793
a DA. You're supposed
to be on the opposing side.

22:29.827 --> 22:32.096
Okay, I'll head over to JT's,
see if Vincent went there.

22:32.130 --> 22:33.864
I'll meet you there.

22:33.898 --> 22:36.012
And the doors blew open,
he jumped out the side.

22:36.013 --> 22:37.888
Sorry.
No interviews. He's a witness.

22:38.503 --> 22:40.470
You're the...?
Visualization officer.

22:40.505 --> 22:42.305
Detective Flannery
and I were speaking.

22:42.339 --> 22:44.441
He said that you got
banged up pretty bad.

22:44.475 --> 22:45.809
Oh, yeah, my
head. It was...

22:45.843 --> 22:47.811
Yeah, well, sometimes
when that happens,

22:47.845 --> 22:50.079
your brain starts visualizing
things that weren't

22:50.114 --> 22:51.480
really there.

22:51.515 --> 22:52.916
You know,
like hallucinations.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.850
What you saw wasn't real.
- I guess...

23:03.027 --> 23:04.493
He's not here.
- Meanwhile,

23:04.528 --> 23:05.795
it's a Harrison Ford movie
over there.

23:05.829 --> 23:07.430
The good news is, only one guard

23:07.464 --> 23:08.798
saw him as a
beast, and I think

23:08.832 --> 23:10.332
I put that genie back
in the bottle, so...

23:10.366 --> 23:12.167
So, what about security
cameras? What about

23:12.201 --> 23:14.403
flashing banners running
across every TV screen

23:14.438 --> 23:16.104
shouting, "War Hero
Turned Murderer

23:16.139 --> 23:17.573
Now Fugitive"?
- JT.

23:17.607 --> 23:19.074
I just don't understand.

23:19.108 --> 23:21.076
I tied that gem
to him so tight,

23:21.110 --> 23:22.577
I thought he was
gonna lose circulation.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.313
I think Vincent took
it off on purpose.

23:24.347 --> 23:25.647
- What?
- What?

23:25.681 --> 23:27.316
I tried to tell
you before.

23:27.350 --> 23:28.483
I found something
in the ambulance.

23:28.517 --> 23:29.484
That's his bandage.

23:29.518 --> 23:30.852
It's torn apart.

23:30.886 --> 23:32.154
It's like he wanted
to get rid of the gem

23:32.188 --> 23:33.488
so he could beast out.

23:33.522 --> 23:34.489
Detective Flannery
said that Vincent

23:34.523 --> 23:35.790
instigated a fight in jail.

23:35.825 --> 23:37.292
He probably did it
because he knew

23:37.327 --> 23:38.960
they would transfer him
to a hospital; be easier

23:38.994 --> 23:40.929
to break out of an ambulance
than out of a jail cell.

23:40.963 --> 23:43.364
No way. Vincent said
he was ready

23:43.398 --> 23:44.766
to face the consequences,
take the sentence.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.768
That was before
I told him that

23:46.802 --> 23:48.169
I was going to come forward
as a witness.

23:48.203 --> 23:51.439
I'm sorry. You did what?
JT.

23:51.474 --> 23:53.514
He was going to plead guilty.
I had to do something.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.542
Fine, but-but don't
tell him about it!

23:55.577 --> 23:57.778
JT!
- Stop JT-ing me!

23:57.812 --> 24:00.381
She knows Vincent. You basically
told him you were going to lose

24:00.415 --> 24:02.283
your job, face jail time,
all for him!

24:02.317 --> 24:03.817
That was his whole impetus

24:03.852 --> 24:05.853
for pleading guilty
in the first place!

24:05.887 --> 24:07.521
I didn't know that he would
do something this crazy.

24:07.555 --> 24:09.556
Okay, why don't we all
just get back

24:09.591 --> 24:11.492
to clearing Vincent's name,
exposing Reynolds...

24:11.526 --> 24:13.660
Clearing his name? I think we're
a little past Windsor's murder.

24:13.695 --> 24:14.695
Maybe Tess is right.

24:14.729 --> 24:16.463
You know, we can prove

24:16.498 --> 24:18.031
that Vincent was falsely
accused, that he was set up,

24:18.065 --> 24:20.066
and then he panicked,
and it triggered his PTSD.

24:20.101 --> 24:22.235
Panicked? That's
his ticket to freedom?

24:22.269 --> 24:23.504
What do you think, counselor?

24:23.538 --> 24:24.872
You've been
pretty quiet over there.

24:24.906 --> 24:26.707
How's that gonna
fly in a court of law?

24:26.741 --> 24:28.641
I recuse myself.
- Smart move.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.077
Especially since it's kind of
hard to defend someone

24:31.112 --> 24:32.512
that can't take the stand

24:32.546 --> 24:34.514
because they blurred away
to God knows where!

24:34.548 --> 24:35.869
Just because
he bolted from prison

24:35.883 --> 24:36.916
doesn't mean
that he bolted from us.

24:36.950 --> 24:38.485
Yes, it does.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.353
The whole reason
he did it was

24:40.388 --> 24:42.055
to keep the heat
off of us, off of you.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.490
No, he wouldn't just leave.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.924
You think he's gonna
hang around now?

24:44.958 --> 24:47.059
He's probably
laying low somewhere.

24:47.093 --> 24:50.029
Really? Where?

24:52.232 --> 24:53.733
Where are you going?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.704
He's not gone.

25:03.910 --> 25:06.778
So, you thinking
he might have left a clue here

25:06.812 --> 25:08.034
about where he might
have gone, or...?

25:08.059 --> 25:08.880
 No.

25:08.881 --> 25:10.949
I'm just wondering,
why are we here?

25:10.983 --> 25:12.751
Especially since
it's my second time today.

25:12.785 --> 25:14.420
You didn't
have to come.

25:14.454 --> 25:17.222
Is this still about me
dropping you off a block away?

25:17.257 --> 25:19.090
I only did that
so you weren't uncomfortable.

25:19.124 --> 25:19.720
Me?

25:19.745 --> 25:21.626
You were the one
who said it was just one night.

25:21.627 --> 25:22.861
Because the first thing
out of your mouth

25:22.895 --> 25:24.228
was, "Cat doesn't know, right?"

25:24.263 --> 25:25.530
Oh, come on, we're all
a little vulnerable

25:25.565 --> 25:26.898
post-hookup, but I'm here now.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.100
But you know what?
I'm getting sick of

25:29.134 --> 25:31.269
getting yelled at for trying.
Unbelievable. I probably just lost

25:31.303 --> 25:33.038
my best friend
in the world,

25:33.072 --> 25:35.273
and you're making it about...
What? Our non-relationship

25:35.274 --> 25:38.276
that you told everyone about
without even asking me?

25:39.744 --> 25:41.612
Whatever. Forget
I said anything.

25:41.646 --> 25:43.181
I'll be in the car.

25:45.817 --> 25:47.151
Well, he's not here.

25:47.186 --> 25:48.953
Do you think
he's gone, too?

25:48.987 --> 25:50.955
No, I think he's waiting till
it's safe to come find you.

25:50.989 --> 25:52.590
Why are you
being so quiet?

25:52.624 --> 25:53.891
Because I don't want
to seem like some vulture,

25:53.925 --> 25:55.459
waiting to swoop in.
- Gabe, what?

25:55.493 --> 25:57.294
You think he's doing this
to protect you?

25:57.328 --> 25:59.897
I think he's afraid that
he can't handle time inside.

25:59.931 --> 26:01.565
You also thought that he had
a heart in his fridge.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.800
Well, maybe
I'm wrong,

26:02.834 --> 26:04.568
maybe his motives
are pure,

26:04.603 --> 26:06.269
but it doesn't feel
very protective, okay?

26:06.304 --> 26:08.472
Here you are, searching
the city, worried sick,

26:08.506 --> 26:10.240
and he is gonna show up
here, a fugitive,

26:10.274 --> 26:12.109
and you're going to be
the one protecting him.

26:12.143 --> 26:14.244
I would never
do that to you.

26:14.278 --> 26:15.979
Now I really do sound
like a vulture.

26:19.049 --> 26:20.350
Hey.

26:20.384 --> 26:21.618
You know how,

26:21.652 --> 26:22.952
when Muirfield
was after Vincent,

26:22.987 --> 26:24.253
he had to be ready to run?

26:24.287 --> 26:25.588
He kept a go bag,

26:25.623 --> 26:27.590
filled with cash,
phones, passports.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.425
Yeah, in the headstone.
We saw it this morning.

26:29.459 --> 26:32.929
Yeah, well, it's gone, so...

26:32.963 --> 26:35.131
So he's gone, too.

26:36.634 --> 26:37.800
Yeah.

26:39.003 --> 26:40.302

were both wrong.

28:03.117 --> 28:05.785
Catherine, I've come
to say good-bye.

28:05.820 --> 28:07.286
♪ Because you're all that I

28:07.321 --> 28:08.554
Good-bye?

28:11.460 --> 28:12.450
Where are you going?

28:12.475 --> 28:14.270
I don't know where exactly.

28:14.271 --> 28:16.372
I just don't want you
to throw away your life, okay?

28:16.407 --> 28:18.208
Oh, right, 'cause this is
all for me? No, thank you.

28:18.242 --> 28:19.542
Come on...
- Vincent, it makes me

28:19.577 --> 28:21.244
responsible for
this colossal mess.

28:22.646 --> 28:23.946
I don't know
whether to kiss you

28:23.981 --> 28:25.215
or throw you
off this roof.

28:25.249 --> 28:27.950
I do.
- No.

28:27.985 --> 28:29.552
I made the decision
to come forward

28:29.587 --> 28:31.254
for a whole
slew of reasons,

28:31.288 --> 28:32.688
and you don't get
to negate that.

28:33.991 --> 28:35.591
Look, I turn myself in,

28:35.626 --> 28:37.459
you go on the stand, you tell
everyone you were lying,

28:37.494 --> 28:38.761
you could lose your job.
So you can

28:38.795 --> 28:39.996
sacrifice for me,
but I can't

28:40.030 --> 28:41.463
sacrifice for you?
- Yes, because

28:41.498 --> 28:42.798
we don't even know
if that sacrifice

28:42.833 --> 28:44.233
would be worth it
in the end, do we?

28:44.267 --> 28:46.435
Look, let's say
your defense works.

28:46.469 --> 28:48.671
Best-case scenario,
they throw me in some ward

28:48.705 --> 28:50.405
and label me mentally unstable.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.508
But most likely,
I will serve a sentence

28:52.542 --> 28:53.975
for a very, very long time.

28:54.010 --> 28:55.910
And I don't know
if I can handle that.

28:55.945 --> 28:58.013
But you said you'd be okay.
You have the gem.

28:58.047 --> 29:00.149
Catherine, that gem
is just a Band-Aid, okay?

29:00.183 --> 29:01.416
It's not gonna protect
my humanity.

29:01.451 --> 29:03.852
You could give up
everything for us,

29:03.886 --> 29:05.320
and I could get
out of there worse

29:05.355 --> 29:06.688
than the beast I was
when I killed Windsor.

29:06.722 --> 29:08.289
Come on,
you know it's true.

29:08.323 --> 29:09.958
That's why you were willing
to risk everything

29:09.992 --> 29:11.092
to get me out of there.

29:11.127 --> 29:12.593
No, I am risking everything

29:12.628 --> 29:13.895
because I love you.

29:18.801 --> 29:20.835
I'm sorry,
but I gotta say good-bye.

29:22.237 --> 29:24.105
And ask you for
one last night

29:24.140 --> 29:26.974
where we can love each other
as much as we do right now.

29:30.479 --> 29:31.712
Fine.

29:31.746 --> 29:33.281
You win.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.449
Now give me your
burner phone.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.218
How is that me winning?

29:37.252 --> 29:39.420
Just give it to me.
I have to call JT.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.360
Hello?

29:47.395 --> 29:48.628
JT, he's here.
What?

29:48.663 --> 29:50.164
Yeah.

29:50.198 --> 29:51.965
I need security footage,
prints, financials,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.167
all from
the boat.

29:53.201 --> 29:54.534
We have until morning.
Got it.

29:58.272 --> 29:59.673
Let's call it
a win-win.

29:59.707 --> 30:01.341
You get your night,
and I am not

30:01.375 --> 30:02.642
calling it
our last.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.252
Wow, I never really realized

30:12.286 --> 30:14.087
how many windows
you actually have.

30:14.121 --> 30:15.855
Well, that was a big selling point,
lots of light.

30:15.889 --> 30:17.924
But that was
before I met you.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.358
I mean, we'd met, in
the woods, but, uh...

30:19.392 --> 30:20.927
Where are
we going?

30:20.961 --> 30:22.929
You realize my bedroom
has lots of windows, too.

30:22.963 --> 30:24.797
Right.

30:31.271 --> 30:34.072
This is where we're gonna
spend our not-last night?

30:34.107 --> 30:36.208
Well, at least
it's intimate.

30:36.243 --> 30:37.710
What if I
have to pee?

30:37.744 --> 30:39.111
Well,
I won't look.

30:39.145 --> 30:40.346
Or listen.

30:41.981 --> 30:44.182
So, uh... what do
you want to do?

30:44.217 --> 30:46.685
I could take a hot bath.
Drain's broken.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.553
Okay, well,
how about some dinner?

30:48.587 --> 30:50.856
Yeah, a dry
bathtub dinner

30:50.890 --> 30:52.390
as some homage

30:52.424 --> 30:54.025
to rooftop picnics...
- Look, Catherine,

30:54.060 --> 30:55.426
I know you don't
want to accept

30:55.461 --> 30:56.928
that tonight could
be our last night

30:56.963 --> 30:59.865
as much as I do,
but it might, so...

30:59.899 --> 31:01.532
So bring out
the tissues?

31:01.567 --> 31:04.101
I have those
in here.

31:05.504 --> 31:06.738
Hand me your phone.

31:06.772 --> 31:09.039
I'm not gonna
call anybody.

31:09.074 --> 31:10.275

What?
Yeah, woke up the judge.

33:03.886 --> 33:05.052
I got a subpoena.

33:05.087 --> 33:06.888
About a week ago,
Reynolds transferred

33:06.922 --> 33:08.689
$10,000 to an ex-convict

33:08.723 --> 33:09.891
named Harry Salvo.

33:09.925 --> 33:11.359
Figured we'd surprise him.

33:11.393 --> 33:12.659
See what he has
to say for himself.

33:13.862 --> 33:15.162
He's here?

that JT called you, and

Hey.

33:20.568 --> 33:21.869
Hey, good news.

33:21.903 --> 33:23.003
Gabe found out

33:23.037 --> 33:24.037
who framed you.

33:24.071 --> 33:25.739
I heard, yeah, thank you.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.841
You do know there are
cops downstairs, right?

33:27.876 --> 33:29.910
- Yeah.
- But see?

33:29.944 --> 33:31.278
This could fix this.
This Salvo guy could be

33:31.312 --> 33:32.612
the thing that makes
this all go away.

33:32.646 --> 33:35.382
Not all, but yeah.

33:35.416 --> 33:36.917
Okay, just don't leave

33:36.951 --> 33:38.618
until I come back.

33:42.390 --> 33:44.724
I'm sorry I doubted you.

33:44.758 --> 33:47.260
I mean, you found the guy,
you got the evidence.

33:47.295 --> 33:49.295
One more thing and
it's a hat trick.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.096
Just leveling
the playing field.

33:51.131 --> 33:53.399
Okay, I realize I started
with a sports analogy,

33:53.434 --> 33:56.436
but this isn't a game,
and you can't win me.

33:56.470 --> 33:57.904
I can try.

33:57.938 --> 34:00.005
This is it.

34:02.075 --> 34:03.409
Mr. Salvo?

34:03.444 --> 34:05.744
NYPD.

34:16.356 --> 34:18.223
What are you guys talking about?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.724
Harry Salvo, the guy you paid

34:19.759 --> 34:21.460
to put that jar
in Vincent's houseboat.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.328
- He's dead.
- So what happened?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.096
You knew we'd get to him,
so you had him killed?

34:25.130 --> 34:26.831
Now, wait a second,
I swear to God, I...

34:26.866 --> 34:28.900
We have records
of the transaction.

34:28.935 --> 34:30.835
Okay, yeah, I hired him,
but I didn't have him killed.

34:30.870 --> 34:33.237
We're supposed to believe you?

34:33.272 --> 34:35.273
Look, I don't know
what happened to Salvo,

34:35.306 --> 34:37.442
but every TV in this prison
is showing footage

34:37.476 --> 34:39.077
of Vincent's miraculous escape.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.411
What are you saying?

34:40.446 --> 34:41.478
I'm saying that
somebody saw it

34:41.513 --> 34:44.081
and knows what he is.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.183
And the fact that they got
to Salvo means it's

34:45.217 --> 34:46.985
probably somebody on the inside.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.918
Inside what? Like Muirfield?

34:48.954 --> 34:51.621
They had clients
all around the world.

34:51.656 --> 34:52.755
They were hired by governments.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.859
I think he might be right.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.333
You know that jail guard who saw
Vincent? I just got an alert.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.762
He died
of a sudden heart attack.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.997
A heart attack,
not an attack attack.

35:01.031 --> 35:02.866
Hours after he was on the news,
saying he saw a beast?

35:02.900 --> 35:05.835
This is why I don't want you
anywhere near Vincent.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.303
Not just to protect you
from him,

35:07.337 --> 35:08.371
but from whoever else
is after him.

35:08.405 --> 35:10.607
And there's always going to be

35:10.641 --> 35:11.941
someone.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.776
I will be fine.

35:17.747 --> 35:18.847
Lowan?

35:20.984 --> 35:23.952
There's not much more
I can do from in here.

35:23.987 --> 35:25.787
But you can.

35:25.822 --> 35:27.289
You mean protect her?
I've been trying.

35:27.324 --> 35:28.491
Well, you need to try harder.

35:32.829 --> 35:35.864
You know, for once,
I think you might be right.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.480
Someone else
is after you.

35:52.515 --> 35:54.315
They killed
Reynolds' accomplice.

35:54.350 --> 35:56.251
And I think they killed
the guard that-that saw you.

35:56.285 --> 35:58.486
So we have to go. Now.

35:58.521 --> 36:00.321
Stay away from the window.

36:02.791 --> 36:04.992
Catherine,
you can't come with me.

36:05.027 --> 36:06.861
I just got you back.
I'm not letting you go again.

36:06.895 --> 36:08.829
Especially if I know
that people are after you.

36:08.864 --> 36:11.666
People are always gonna be
after me, okay?

36:11.700 --> 36:13.000
I will be fine.

36:13.035 --> 36:14.835
Yeah, but I won't be.

36:14.870 --> 36:16.704
Look, I keep I saying
that I need

36:16.738 --> 36:18.472
to move forward,
but towards what?

36:19.741 --> 36:21.341
You know,
maybe my moving forward

36:21.376 --> 36:22.509
is coming with you.

36:24.645 --> 36:26.947
Unless you don't want me
to come?

36:26.981 --> 36:29.950
Of course I do.

36:29.984 --> 36:32.086
Look, the whole time
I was in there,

36:32.120 --> 36:35.189
they're trying to take my DNA,
all I could think about was you.

36:35.223 --> 36:38.358
You stopped me
from losing myself.

36:38.393 --> 36:41.728
Catherine, don't you get it?
You are my gem, okay?

36:41.762 --> 36:43.797
I want to take you
everywhere with me, but...

36:43.831 --> 36:46.766
No, it's too much to ask.

36:46.801 --> 36:48.367
It's not your decision.
Where are we going?

36:48.402 --> 36:49.869
Canada?

36:51.606 --> 36:53.439
What?

37:02.205 --> 37:03.775
Come on we gotta go.
Now!

37:04.021 --> 37:05.781
Maybe we can get out
on the rooftop. Come on.

37:05.887 --> 37:08.455
No.
What do you mean no?

37:08.489 --> 37:10.016
I'm just gonna slow you down.

37:10.041 --> 37:11.458
You won't slow me down.
Let's go.

37:11.459 --> 37:13.593
Vincent, I can't come
with you now.

37:13.627 --> 37:15.528
But you and I,
we will find each other.

37:15.563 --> 37:16.930
We'll survive this.

37:16.965 --> 37:18.631
You don't know that.

37:18.666 --> 37:19.833
You have to leave
without me.

37:19.867 --> 37:20.948
If you don't, they're gonna

37:20.968 --> 37:22.301
catch you and they'll kill you.

37:22.336 --> 37:23.936
And that is something
I can't survive.

37:30.878 --> 37:32.979
Give me your cuffs.
Why, what for?

37:33.013 --> 37:34.814
Sit. They can't know
you had anything

37:34.849 --> 37:36.983
to do with this. Now, sit.

37:37.017 --> 37:39.651
Sit or I won't leave, please.

37:39.686 --> 37:41.220
You realize this is the third
time you've done this to me.

37:41.255 --> 37:44.123
Fourth, actually.

37:49.729 --> 37:51.697
I promise you I will
find you again, okay?

37:51.731 --> 37:52.831
I know.

37:57.003 --> 37:59.037
Police! Don't move!

37:59.071 --> 38:00.372
Get on the ground!
Nobody move!

38:00.407 --> 38:01.740
Where'd he go?

38:01.775 --> 38:03.709
He left.

38:03.743 --> 38:05.878
Bedroom's clear!

38:05.912 --> 38:07.078
You okay?

38:07.113 --> 38:08.346
No.

38:08.381 --> 38:09.714
All clear!

38:09.748 --> 38:11.028
Let's get you
out of these cuffs.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.260
Hey.

38:22.295 --> 38:23.328
I thought you said

38:23.362 --> 38:24.495
I had till morning.

38:24.515 --> 38:26.048
They found him.

38:26.082 --> 38:27.683
Oh, my God.

38:27.718 --> 38:28.818
He's safe.

38:28.852 --> 38:31.020
But he had to, uh, blur away.

38:31.054 --> 38:33.523
So, uh...

38:33.557 --> 38:34.690
He's gone.

38:34.725 --> 38:37.226
And he would've
said good-bye,

38:37.260 --> 38:38.895
but, uh...

38:38.929 --> 38:41.431
I hate good-byes anyway, so...

38:41.465 --> 38:42.564
Yeah, me, too.

38:43.934 --> 38:47.669
He's gonna be okay, JT.

38:47.703 --> 38:51.140
And we're gonna be okay, too.

39:20.135 --> 39:21.569
I'm so sorry.

39:21.603 --> 39:23.438
Thing is I've been
preparing for this

39:23.472 --> 39:26.274
for over a decade.

39:26.308 --> 39:29.543
I mean, when he went
off to Afghanistan,

39:29.578 --> 39:30.778
they told me he was dead.

39:30.812 --> 39:33.413
So, I guess that's why I'm

39:33.448 --> 39:36.383
doubly upset at myself

39:36.417 --> 39:37.885
for taking my freak out

39:37.919 --> 39:39.419
out on you.

39:39.454 --> 39:41.655
Yeah, that wasn't okay.

39:41.690 --> 39:43.991
I'm not done.

39:44.025 --> 39:46.927
I'm sorry you thought

39:46.962 --> 39:50.063
that I thought last night
was a one-night thing.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.598
It never was.

39:51.632 --> 39:53.333
Not for me.

39:53.368 --> 39:54.968
Or me either.

39:55.003 --> 39:58.171
But you didn't want
anyone else to know.

39:58.206 --> 40:00.507
No, I didn't want
Cat to know.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.942
You know, rub it in her face
that I could actually

40:02.977 --> 40:05.077
be in a,
in a viable relationship,

40:05.112 --> 40:07.279
non-relationship, whatever.

40:07.314 --> 40:09.348
Hey.

40:09.383 --> 40:11.317
We just had
our first fight.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.920

use right now.

Do you want to go get a drink?

40:23.863 --> 40:25.664
Like in public?

40:25.698 --> 40:27.133
Sure.

40:27.167 --> 40:29.068
Okay.

broke free of his restraints,
overpowered
