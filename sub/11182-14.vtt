01:17.600 --> 01:21.867
-How about it, Florence?
-Oh, Lena Horne,
eat your heart out.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.700
Miss Jefferson, you're gonna
be the belle of your reunion,

01:25.767 --> 01:27.900
just like you were the
belle of your senior class.

01:27.967 --> 01:32.600
Some belle. I went
through high school without
ringing anybody's chimes.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.300
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:34.367 --> 01:36.367
Well, I know
what you mean, child.

01:36.433 --> 01:39.500
'Cause when I was
in high school, the only bell
I heard was the tardy bell,

01:41.067 --> 01:42.600
and the going home bell.

01:45.633 --> 01:49.000
Well, hello, Florence.
May I use your top?

01:49.800 --> 01:52.367
Beg your pardon?

01:52.433 --> 01:55.367
I mean your stove top.
Mine isn't working.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.933
-Oh, sure, come on in.
-Oh, thank you.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.533
Did you call the gas company
about it, Mr. Bentley?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.167
Yes, I did,
and they're treating
it like a rush job.

02:03.233 --> 02:06.700
They're sending
a man over next week.

02:06.767 --> 02:10.867
-I say, what a
smashing dress.
-Oh, why, thank you.

02:10.933 --> 02:13.067
I'm going to
my high school reunion.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.533
Oh, really?
I went to a reunion once.
Didn't recognize a soul.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.267
Everyone changed
that much, huh?

02:20.333 --> 02:24.167
No, I was
at the wrong reunion.

02:24.233 --> 02:27.733
I think the stove is waiting
for you, Mr. Bentley.
You got everything?

02:27.800 --> 02:30.800
Well, I think so.
I'm just going to
fix some resoles.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.600
Resoles? What's resoles?

02:32.667 --> 02:34.633
Oh, they're sort of
English meatballs.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.667
You just dip them
in egg and bread crumb
and fry them.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.500
I'm going to serve mine
with collard greens and
black-eyed peas,

02:41.567 --> 02:44.167
and call them
"Bentley's resole food".

02:46.867 --> 02:48.800
"Bentley's resole food".

02:50.300 --> 02:52.200
You know, when
Mr. Bentley was a kid,

02:52.267 --> 02:54.700
he sure must have
inhaled a lot of that
London fog.

02:57.133 --> 03:01.267
You know, I'm beginning
to have second thoughts
about going to that reunion.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.367
Why? According to your
yearbook you were pretty
popular in high school.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.267
What makes you say that?

03:06.333 --> 03:09.067
Because in this picture
you were the President of
the Camera Club.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.600
I was the only one
who had a camera.

03:12.967 --> 03:14.933
And here's a picture of
you in the Glee Club.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.233
I was the only one
who could sing bass.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.567
Oh, Mrs. J, I just realized
that I said resoles
were English meatballs.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.800
I didn't mean
you had to make
them with English meat.

03:25.867 --> 03:29.133
American meat is
quite good enough.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.167
I mean, just in
case you thought that...

03:32.233 --> 03:34.567
I... Right!

03:37.033 --> 03:41.067
Oh, look out! Who is this
super-charged superman?

03:41.133 --> 03:45.267
Oh, that's Bo Morrison.
He was captain of the
football team.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.800
Hmm... Now there's a real
mound of American meat.

03:47.867 --> 03:50.167
I wouldn't mind making
resoles with him.

03:51.633 --> 03:53.933
He was also President of
the Senior Class.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.767
All the girls in school
had a crush on Bo.

03:56.833 --> 03:57.867
Including you?

03:57.933 --> 04:01.533
Of course. But I never
had a chance with him.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.267
What do you mean? He even
wrote a poem in your book.

04:04.333 --> 04:08.067
Bo wrote a poem
in every girl's book.

04:08.133 --> 04:11.200
But in this picture,
you're standing right next
to him in the cafeteria line.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.400
Now that was my lucky day.

04:13.467 --> 04:17.600
Bo lost his wallet,
and he let me pay
for his sloppy joe sandwich.

04:19.867 --> 04:21.467
Hey, Weezy.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.267
Oh, hi, George.

04:30.333 --> 04:34.167
Are you ready for the big
night? We are going to
dance until daylight! Oh!

04:37.167 --> 04:41.167
How about that?
A tiny turkey trying
to be a disco horse.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.667
Ain't you got
something better to do?

04:44.733 --> 04:48.833
I must have.
Anything's better
than watching you.

04:48.900 --> 04:52.533
George, I think you're
more excited about going
to my reunion than I am.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.000
Why not? I can't wait
to show them old
classmates of yours

04:55.067 --> 04:58.833
that Louise Mills
batted one thousand
in the marriage department.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.833
And just to show them
how lucky you really are,

05:01.900 --> 05:04.400
I bought you this. Shoom!

05:04.467 --> 05:07.567
Oh, a mink jacket!

05:10.233 --> 05:13.033
Oh, George, it's beautiful.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.267
But don't you think it's
a little warm to
wear a mink jacket?

05:16.333 --> 05:18.233
Why? Minks wear
them all year round.

05:20.567 --> 05:23.067
You know, it's hard to
fight that kind of logic.

05:23.133 --> 05:26.267
Hey, Weez, maybe
the band will play
our song tonight, huh?

05:26.333 --> 05:29.400
Your song?
You mean the theme from
The Beauty and the Beast?

05:31.033 --> 05:33.833
Mona Lisa, dummy.
Remember, Weez?

05:33.900 --> 05:36.567
* Mona Lisa

05:36.633 --> 05:39.100
* Mona Lisa

05:39.167 --> 05:42.600
* Men have named you

05:42.667 --> 05:46.167
* You're so like the lady
with the mystic smile *

05:46.233 --> 05:47.233
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.433
Mona Lisa was playing
the first time we kissed.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.700
Hmm, what's that smell?

05:53.767 --> 05:54.967
It's Mr. Bentley.

05:55.033 --> 05:56.700
No, he smells
better than that.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.067
His stove isn't working,
so he's cooking
in our kitchen.

06:01.133 --> 06:07.300
Oh, cooking? Hmm, hey,
hey, you and me gonna be
cooking tonight, huh, Weez?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.500
You know something, Weezy?
You're lucky I didn't
finish high school.

06:10.567 --> 06:11.767
Why is that?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.967
'Cause if I had
a class reunion,

06:14.033 --> 06:16.067
all the girls would be
wanting to dance with me, and
you'd have to wait in line.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.900
Because I mean,
I was really popular.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.800
Shoot.
You wasn't as popular
as Miss Jefferson.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.633
Say what?

06:22.700 --> 06:25.467
When Miss Jefferson was
in high school, all the
boys was chasing her.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.733
They were?

06:28.667 --> 06:30.433
Yeah. Look at this.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.467
Florence...

06:32.533 --> 06:34.233
Say, Weezy,
what made you take a picture
with that jive turkey?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.767
Because he was the
captain of the football team.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.867
And he had a big
crush on Miss Jefferson.

06:38.933 --> 06:39.967
Oh...

06:40.033 --> 06:41.733
Now, Florence,
you know that's not...

06:41.800 --> 06:43.467
Listen to this poem
he wrote in her book.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.900
"Until the time
we meet again,

06:45.967 --> 06:49.133
"I hope you'll always
be my friend."

06:49.200 --> 06:54.333
Big deal! How about
all the poems I sent you
when I was in the Navy?

06:54.400 --> 06:59.267
Oh, yes. I'll never
forget the romantic one
you sent me from Korea.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.400
"Roses are red,
violets are nice.

07:02.467 --> 07:04.900
"Man, am I sick
of eating rice."

07:07.667 --> 07:10.867
Ooh, you little
sweet-talker you.

07:10.933 --> 07:14.767
Ha, ha. Well, at least Weezy
made the right choice when
she picked me over this clown.

07:14.833 --> 07:19.133
Right choice? She passed
up a Billy Dee Williams
for a Rodney Allen Rippy.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.767
Well, if I'm going to my
cousin's for dinner, I guess
I better get moving fast.

07:27.833 --> 07:31.533
Where's my camera?
If she's gonna be moving fast,
I wanna get a picture of that!

07:32.633 --> 07:33.900
(DOORBELL RINGS)

07:33.967 --> 07:35.100
Get that, Florence.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.733
I'm not going
in that direction.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.500
I'll get it.

07:40.567 --> 07:41.967
How come whenever
there's work around,

07:42.033 --> 07:43.833
she's always going
in the opposite direction?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.300
Oh, hello, Ralph.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.133
I just stopped up to
deliver your mail,
Mrs. Jefferson.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.800
You're the doorman.
Why do you wanna be
the mailman, too?

07:52.867 --> 07:55.300
It's just one of my
many little extra
services that I do,

07:55.367 --> 07:59.400
which I don't have to do,
but I like to do for the
fine tenants in this building,

07:59.467 --> 08:02.333
who have proven themselves
wonderfully generous.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.133
Ah, man, Ralph, you know,

08:04.200 --> 08:07.800
you're the only person
I know that turns every day
into Christmas.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.067
Well, ho, ho, ho.

08:11.967 --> 08:14.067
Well, no, no, no.

08:17.367 --> 08:18.800
George...

08:18.867 --> 08:22.000
-Oh, here.
-Thank you, sir.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.233
But, sir...

08:24.300 --> 08:26.067
Yeah, "but, sir" what?

08:26.133 --> 08:29.867
Well, sir, you'll notice
the post office has
raised the price of delivery.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.333
Yeah, I know.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.933
And I was wondering,
in view of the general
inflationary pressure,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.567
that you, too, would
increase my usual
gratuity accordingly?

08:38.633 --> 08:39.800
Uh, what?

08:39.867 --> 08:42.033
Ralph wants a cost
of living increase.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.300
-Oh, okay, sure,
I'll give you one.
-Thank you, sir.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.933
As soon as I get my cost
of tipping increase.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.967
That's very funny, sir.

08:51.033 --> 08:54.867
By the way, sir, I was
looking through your copy
of New York Magazine.

08:54.933 --> 08:58.033
There's a very
interesting article in there
I think you'll enjoy.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.733
It's called, "How
Smart New Yorkers
Save Money".

09:01.800 --> 09:06.000
Oh. I know how they do that.
They just move into a building
that ain't got no doorman.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.667
(GEORGE SCATS)

09:10.933 --> 09:12.667
Hey, hey, great,
this is from my lawyer.

09:12.733 --> 09:16.567
-Oh, what's that, George?
-Just my will.
I changed it a little.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.967
Changed?
What was wrong
with your old will?

09:19.033 --> 09:23.733
Well, my bank book has got
more pages, so I had
to add pages to my will.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.500
Florence?
Wanna witness my signature?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.800
Sure, if it's on
a check to me.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.400
-Here, sign.
-I ain't signing no
strange piece of paper

09:31.467 --> 09:32.867
I ain't never seen before.

09:32.933 --> 09:35.067
-Sign!
-The last time I did that,

09:35.133 --> 09:37.367
I wound up with
a year's subscription to
Better Homes and Gardens.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.367
And I didn't
even have a garden.

09:40.967 --> 09:43.367
You ain't gonna have
no home if you don't sign.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.667
Well, what is it?

09:46.733 --> 09:49.733
Look, you can bet your life
nothing in here concerns you.
It's my will.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.400
Your will?
Oh, I'll sign to that.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.000
Oh, what changes have you
made in your will, George?

09:56.067 --> 09:57.900
Oh, nothing important.

09:57.967 --> 10:00.567
Well, I'm leaving now. I
hope you have a nice time
at your reunion.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.600
She'll be dancing with me,
won't she?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.733
Well, try to have
a nice time anyway.

10:12.067 --> 10:14.200
See, now I need one more
person to sign this.

10:14.267 --> 10:17.633
-I'll sign it.
-No, you can't do that.
You're the beneficiary.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.233
I'm leaving all
my dough to you.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.267
Then you haven't
changed it at all.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.700
No, not much.

10:22.767 --> 10:26.667
Oh, oh... I'm afraid my
back's gone out again.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.600
Bentley!
Great, just what I need.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.200
You need your
back to go out?

10:30.267 --> 10:32.500
Nope. You're in the
perfect position to sign this.

10:32.567 --> 10:36.133
George, Mr. Bentley's hurt.
How did you do it this time?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.500
Oh, I spilled
some salt on the floor,

10:38.567 --> 10:41.833
and I bent down to
throw it over my shoulder
for good luck.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.967
Just sign here.
It's my will.

10:45.033 --> 10:49.067
I'll gladly lend you
my hand, Mr. J, if you'll
lend me your feet.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.300
I gotta save my feet
for dancing to night.

10:51.367 --> 10:54.767
-Oh, please, Mr. J!
-Okay, lay down.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.600
Oh, you're a top!

10:57.667 --> 10:59.767
Yeah, all my friends
say I'm that.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.133
-George,
what does this mean?
-What?

11:04.200 --> 11:07.967
"To my wife, Louise, I
leave all my earthly
possessions..."

11:08.033 --> 11:10.533
That means when
I go you got it.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.467
No, not that part. This part,

11:13.533 --> 11:15.967
"...on the
condition that she
never remarries."

11:16.033 --> 11:19.467
Oh. Well, that's just a
little something I asked
my lawyer to throw in.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.267
Then you can just tell
them to throw it out.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.833
What do you mean by that?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.900
I mean, you have no right
to put that in the will.

11:25.967 --> 11:28.133
I got every right.
It's my will.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.367
This isn't a will.
It's a won't!

11:32.967 --> 11:36.500
-Ahem, Mr. J.
-Oh, oh, okay, I'll be
right there, Bentley.

11:36.567 --> 11:39.033
Look, Weezy,
I mean, why would you
wanna remarry anyway?

11:39.100 --> 11:42.033
Let's face it,
you already have
heaven on Earth.

11:45.233 --> 11:48.033
George, it's not that
I want to remarry.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.967
There's
no one in this whole
world for me but you.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.367
That's true.

11:52.433 --> 11:55.200
But it's not right for you
to order me around like this!

11:55.267 --> 11:57.533
I'm not ordering you around!
I'm protecting you!

11:57.600 --> 12:00.100
-Protecting me?
-That's right.

12:00.167 --> 12:03.300
There's a whole lot of shifty
dudes out there just
waiting to grab some widow.

12:03.367 --> 12:06.067
Oh, George, give
me a little credit.

12:06.133 --> 12:10.133
Look, Weezy, you can have
all the credit you want. It's
the cash I'm worried about.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.900
-What?
-Look, Weezy,

12:14.967 --> 12:17.933
I don't want nobody winding up
in my bed with my bread.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.400
Maybe I should
come back later.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.233
It's okay!

12:24.300 --> 12:26.933
George, I insist that
you take that clause
out of the will!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.800
Weezy, what is
the matter with you?

12:28.867 --> 12:31.533
You sound like you already
picked out another husband.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.033
Huh?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.000
Ah-ha!
So that's it!
Admit it!

12:35.067 --> 12:37.133
Oh, George, you found me out.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.867
The minute you draw your last
breath, I'm gonna hurl myself
into the arms of another man.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.167
-Who is he?
-It's Mr. Bentley,
of course.

12:44.233 --> 12:47.300
-Bentley!
-She's joking, Mr. J!
She's joking!

12:47.367 --> 12:49.767
Oh, I know who it is!

12:49.833 --> 12:52.567
Oh, oh... Oh, you fixed it.
Marvelous. Thank you.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.800
Ah-ha! So it's this old
schoolmate of yours, ain't it?

12:55.867 --> 12:57.267
This Bo Morrison.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.200
Now I know you're crazy.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.000
Look at the two of you
in this picture
in the cafeteria.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.700
If you were squeezed
any closer together,

13:02.767 --> 13:04.800
I wouldn't know where
you began and he ended.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.367
George, you're impossible.
You know that?

13:08.433 --> 13:12.833
Ha! Now I see why you wanted
to take that "no remarriage"
clause out of the will.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.833
-Why?
-Because when I go below,
you go to Bo.

13:22.033 --> 13:25.600
That is the stupidest thing
I ever heard you say.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.300
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
And I've been stupid, right?

13:27.367 --> 13:29.833
Because I didn't dig this
Bo thing from the beginning.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.833
I don't have no time
to stand here and
continue this nonsense.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.767
We can discuss it
after the reunion.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.833
We ain't going to
no damn reunion!

13:38.367 --> 13:41.667
George, you're not gonna
run my life after you're gone.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.667
And you're not gonna run
my life while you're here!

13:43.733 --> 13:46.767
Okay, look, if you want
to go to that reunion and see
your old lover, you go ahead,

13:46.833 --> 13:47.867
but you're going without me.

13:47.933 --> 13:50.600
Well, that'll suit
me just fine!

13:54.400 --> 13:55.667
Hold it!

13:56.167 --> 13:57.167
Hey!

13:58.167 --> 14:00.300
You ain't gonna be no
fox in my mink!

14:09.300 --> 14:11.367
What's the
matter with you?

14:11.433 --> 14:15.267
Oh, I, uh, I think my
resoles are burning.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.200
(KEY JOSTLING IN LOCK)

14:29.733 --> 14:31.300
Weezy...

14:31.367 --> 14:35.000
-Hi.
-Oh, it's only you.

14:35.067 --> 14:39.400
Well, I didn't get no
great big thrill out of
seeing you either.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.233
But at least I was polite.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.300
How come you ain't at the
reunion with Miss Jefferson?

14:44.367 --> 14:47.900
'Cause she's getting
married again, soon as I die.

14:47.967 --> 14:51.900
Wait a minute.
How many of them
drinks have you had?

14:51.967 --> 14:56.067
-Come and sit
next to me, Florence.
-Uh-oh. Too many. Good night.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.700
Will you come here
and sit down?
I wanna ask you something!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.667
Can't you ask me standing up?

15:02.733 --> 15:06.067
No.
It's a sitting question.
Now sit!

15:14.067 --> 15:17.333
Look, Florence,
if you was me...

15:17.967 --> 15:19.533
Which I ain't.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.033
I know you're not.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.333
I said, but if you was me...

15:24.400 --> 15:28.100
If I was you, you'd be
a much nicer person.

15:28.167 --> 15:29.267
Will you shut up?

15:29.333 --> 15:31.567
Then how am I gonna
answer your question?

15:31.633 --> 15:33.567
By giving me a
chance to ask it!

15:33.633 --> 15:35.233
Then you can talk.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.700
Well, just don't start
with "if you was me".

15:38.633 --> 15:40.667
I just finished eating.

15:42.233 --> 15:46.433
All right, look, look,
that will that you signed...

15:46.500 --> 15:49.000
I left all my money
to Weezy. I mean,
everything that I own,

15:49.067 --> 15:52.000
with the one condition
that she don't remarry.
Now she got mad.

15:52.067 --> 15:55.400
Now tell me, am I being
unreasonable? Yes or no?

15:55.467 --> 15:57.067
That can't be answered
with "yes" or "no".

15:57.133 --> 16:00.600
Sure it can!
You can say "yes" I'm right
and "no" she's wrong.

16:00.667 --> 16:04.700
Tell me something, did
Miss Jefferson say she was
gonna get married again?

16:04.767 --> 16:07.300
No. But she didn't
say she wouldn't.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.000
Now you tell me
who you think is right.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.333
-It don't make no difference.
-Say what?

16:11.400 --> 16:15.700
Because you'll
be dead by then.
You won't know what happened.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.300
Yeah, but I know about it
now and it's killing me!

16:19.733 --> 16:21.467
Let me ask you a question.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.667
What if Miss Jefferson
was to go before you?
Would you get married again?

16:24.733 --> 16:27.767
-Of course not.
-Are you willing to
put that in writing?

16:27.833 --> 16:31.000
Promising to give away
all your money if you
get married again?

16:31.067 --> 16:32.833
Now that's crazy.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.433
It ain't no crazier
than what you're asking
of Miss Jefferson.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.800
That's different.

16:36.867 --> 16:38.667
Well, I guess you're right.

16:38.733 --> 16:41.200
After all, the way
Miss Jefferson
throws money around...

16:41.267 --> 16:43.967
Weezy ain't like that.
She's very careful
with my money.

16:44.033 --> 16:45.767
And she's always
looking at other men.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.067
Now don't be talking
like that about Weezy.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.733
She ain't never looked at
another man since the first
day she laid eyes on me!

16:50.800 --> 16:52.700
Oh, well...

16:52.767 --> 16:54.233
Then what was
your question?

16:56.167 --> 16:57.933
The question is...

16:59.067 --> 17:00.900
How the hell am I so stupid?

17:00.967 --> 17:03.500
I don't know.
It just comes
easy to some folks.

17:08.033 --> 17:10.067
Ha, ha, ha.
Florence, I could kiss you.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.900
If you do, they'll be
reading your will tomorrow.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.533
(LAUGHS)

17:19.133 --> 17:21.567
(LIGHT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

17:45.033 --> 17:47.567
Eddie? Eddie Saucer?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.200
Hey! Get off me!

17:55.267 --> 17:58.267
Eddie, it's so good
to see you again.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.433
-I ain't Eddie.
-You can't fool me!

18:01.500 --> 18:03.533
-You're Eddie Saucer.
-No, I ain't.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.367
Yes, you are.

18:05.433 --> 18:09.967
You may have gotten
a little taller, but I'd
know you anywhere.

18:10.033 --> 18:13.500
-Lady, I'm George Jefferson.
-How about that?

18:13.567 --> 18:15.600
You even changed your name.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.100
Look, I didn't change nothing.
My name is George Jefferson.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.600
I never seen you
before in my life.

18:19.667 --> 18:24.000
Up to your old tricks,
huh? Playing like it's
the first time we met.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.200
Well, that's okay with me.

18:26.267 --> 18:30.467
Because I loved what
happened that first time!

18:30.533 --> 18:34.167
Stop climbing all
over me! I told you my
name is George Jefferson!

18:34.233 --> 18:36.233
Whatever you say, Eddie.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.267
(LAUGHS)

18:38.333 --> 18:41.033
Will you cut that out?
I'm ticklish there.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.233
I know, Eddie. Remember?

18:47.033 --> 18:48.667
George, what are
you doing here?

18:48.733 --> 18:51.500
Look, Weezy, I just came down
to tell you how stupid I was.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.600
Do we have enough time?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.867
I deserved it, Weez,
I deserved it.

18:56.933 --> 19:00.167
I just wanted to say that I'm
sorry about everything, and
I'll change the will tomorrow.

19:00.233 --> 19:04.433
Oh, George...
Thank you for being
so understanding.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.400
You're welcome.
And if I ever die,
you can do whatever you want.

19:08.467 --> 19:11.967
Oh, you won't die, George.
You're too stubborn!

19:12.033 --> 19:15.167
I learned my lesson, Weezy.
I mean, I ain't got nothing to
really be suspicious about.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.733
(LAUGHS)

19:16.800 --> 19:19.067
You don't know how true
that is, especially here.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.533
What do you mean here?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.333
I never had any boyfriends
when I was in high school.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.200
Say what?

19:25.267 --> 19:29.633
I went to 43 sock hops,
and I didn't wear out
one pair of socks.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.400
No kidding?

19:31.467 --> 19:34.833
Yeah, nobody ever
paid much attention to me.
I was a wallflower.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.667
Oh. What about this
Bo Morrison guy?

19:37.733 --> 19:41.067
Bo Morrison never paid
any attention to me.

19:41.133 --> 19:44.300
Oh... What about the poem
he wrote in your book?

19:44.367 --> 19:46.900
Bo wrote the same poem
in every girl's book.

19:46.967 --> 19:49.167
Oh. You mean he really
didn't notice you?

19:49.233 --> 19:51.433
I'm sure he doesn't even
remember me.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.333
Ha... Wow...

19:55.767 --> 19:58.533
Excuse me. May I have
this dance?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.733
Why, I'd be delighted.
Do you mind, George?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.200
Of course not.
Knock yourself out.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.767
Okay. Let's go, Bo.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.767
Bo?

20:10.833 --> 20:12.800
Hello, again.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.100
Hey, is that Bo Morrison?

20:17.167 --> 20:20.567
Yes. All the girls
went crazy for him.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.367
Tall, good looking,
full of muscles.

20:23.433 --> 20:26.767
But I like 'em short and puny!

20:30.067 --> 20:31.967
Hey, look, how...
How about
you dancing with me?

20:32.033 --> 20:35.667
Oh, Eddie, I knew
you'd come around!

20:40.267 --> 20:44.300
Ed, where are you running?
This is a dance,
not a track meet.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.133
Oh, excuse me.

20:49.067 --> 20:51.333
Hey, what are you doing?

20:51.400 --> 20:54.200
I'm doing a new dance called
"The Old Boyfriend Stomp".

20:55.800 --> 20:57.200
Sorry.

21:03.167 --> 21:07.333
Hey, man, this is a big
dance floor. Can't you
find your own territory?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.033
I know my territory, chump,
and you're invading it!

21:10.100 --> 21:12.233
Good enough.
Let's not fight about it.

21:12.300 --> 21:16.100
Oh, chicken, huh?
This is our song!

21:17.633 --> 21:21.000
Football sure is a dumb game!
Ha, ha, ha!

21:21.067 --> 21:23.600
And all football
players are sissies!

21:23.667 --> 21:25.933
You ought to tell that to
Mean Joe Greene.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.467
I'm telling it to you, chump,
and I hope you don't like it!

21:28.533 --> 21:31.833
Okay, calm down.
Everyone's entitled
to his own opinion,

21:31.900 --> 21:33.467
no matter how stupid it is.

21:33.533 --> 21:35.100
Stupid?
What do you mean stupid?

21:37.733 --> 21:39.667
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

21:46.733 --> 21:51.700
I'm so embarrassed.
My husband's very jealous.

21:51.767 --> 21:54.700
I don't blame him.
I would be, too.

21:54.767 --> 21:57.133
You know, you're even
prettier than I remember.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.433
I'm surprised that you
remembered me.

21:59.500 --> 22:03.500
-Why?
-Because in high school you
never asked me for a date.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.233
I sure wanted to.
I never got up the nerve.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.867
-Oh, Bo...
-(BOTH LAUGH)

22:08.933 --> 22:10.500
Hey!

22:10.567 --> 22:12.233
Thank you, Claudine.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.300
-What?
-Thanks for the lovely
dance, Claudine.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.267
You're welcome.

22:17.333 --> 22:19.033
(LAUGHS)

22:19.100 --> 22:22.967
Claudine? How 'bout that?
He thought you
was somebody else.

22:23.033 --> 22:25.033
-Yeah.
-He didn't even remember you.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.467
I know.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.600
Hey, Weezy...
Oh, could I get you something?

22:30.667 --> 22:33.967
-No.
-Hey, I'll be right back.

22:37.733 --> 22:41.400
I'd just like to tell you
again how nice it is seeing
you after all these years.

22:41.467 --> 22:44.700
Oh, Bo,
something's puzzling me.

22:44.767 --> 22:49.933
You called me "Claudine".
I don't remember any
Claudine in our class.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.867
I know that, Louise.
But no sense in getting a
jealous husband stirred up.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.633
-Thanks a lot for the dance.
-Oh, it was my pleasure, Bo.

23:03.700 --> 23:08.067
I better quit while I'm ahead.
See you next reunion.

23:08.133 --> 23:11.533
Hey, Weezy, you know
something? That Bo Morrison
is dumber than I thought.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.900
What makes you say that?

23:12.967 --> 23:15.033
I mean, how could he go
through four years of
high school,

23:15.100 --> 23:17.167
and not even notice
the prettiest girl
in the whole class?

23:17.233 --> 23:18.733
Uh, but, George...

23:18.800 --> 23:20.433
Man, what a fool he is.
I mean he'd just be lucky

23:20.500 --> 23:22.033
to have somebody half
as good as you.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.233
George, Bo just came...

23:24.300 --> 23:25.833
I know, Weezy,
but don't feel bad.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.867
You're the
foxiest thing here...

playing our song.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.600
Oh, they'd play
anything for 20 bucks.

23:41.733 --> 23:44.500
* ...mystic smile

23:44.567 --> 23:51.067
* Is it only 'cause
you're lonely they
have blamed you?

23:51.133 --> 23:56.700
* For that Mona Lisa
strangeness in your smile? *

23:56.767 --> 23:59.467
-George...
-Yes?

24:00.933 --> 24:03.300
I love you.
