02:02.002 --> 02:04.027
Is that some sort
of a letter, Marshal?

02:05.505 --> 02:07.666
- Journal.
- Journal.

02:07.707 --> 02:09.607
Good.

02:09.643 --> 02:12.942
You know, I was goin'
to Deadwood, same as you.

02:12.979 --> 02:16.107
- Is that so?
- I had my plans about set.

02:17.751 --> 02:21.949
I only wish to Christ I could get
these past three days back.

02:23.223 --> 02:24.713
I can imagine.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.792
No law at all
in Deadwood,

02:30.831 --> 02:32.423
is that true?

02:32.466 --> 02:34.297
Being on Indian land.

02:35.702 --> 02:37.636
So then you
won't be a marshal?

02:37.671 --> 02:41.368
Taking goods there to open
a hardware business, me and my partner.

02:41.408 --> 02:44.172
If I'd have got there,
I'd have been prospectin'.

02:44.211 --> 02:47.703
Jesus Christ Almighty.
No law at all,

02:47.747 --> 02:51.513
gold you can scoop from the streams
with your bare hands,

02:51.551 --> 02:54.042
and I gotta go
and fuck myself up

02:54.087 --> 02:57.215
by supposedly stealing
Byron Samson's horse.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.316
It's poor damn timing
at the least.

03:04.097 --> 03:05.928
Thank you very much.

03:06.933 --> 03:08.230
You're welcome.

03:09.603 --> 03:11.696
I'm sorry as hell
about your shoulder.

03:11.738 --> 03:15.401
Flesh wound. Don't look like
it wants to infect.

03:15.442 --> 03:19.276
Well, never mind
flesh wounds, sir,

03:19.312 --> 03:22.440
when you are goin'
to meet your maker,

03:22.482 --> 03:25.974
you don't feature telling him that you
shot a marshal in the shoulder

03:26.019 --> 03:28.749
for only doing
his legally ordained job.

03:28.788 --> 03:30.983
He may have heard
worse stories.

03:31.024 --> 03:35.825
God? Well, if he ain't,
I'll tell him six or seven

03:35.862 --> 03:38.763
just on people of my own
personal acquaintance.

03:41.034 --> 03:43.764
I'd like to suggest
an idea to you, sir,

03:43.803 --> 03:45.930
that I pray as
a Christian man

03:45.972 --> 03:48.304
you will entertain
on its own fuckin' merits.

03:53.813 --> 03:56.008
Does it involve
letting you go?

03:56.049 --> 03:59.212
I know two scores,
Mr. Bullock,

03:59.252 --> 04:01.049
that we could
make in transit

04:01.087 --> 04:03.351
without moving
20 feet off our path.

04:03.390 --> 04:05.881
People with cash on hand,

04:05.926 --> 04:07.553
and if once we hit Deadwood

04:07.594 --> 04:10.563
and you didn't want to have
anything to do with me,

04:10.597 --> 04:12.895
we'd never speak again.

04:12.933 --> 04:16.869
We would meet as strangers
the rest of our fuckin' lives.

04:16.903 --> 04:18.870
Now...

04:18.904 --> 04:21.772
you tell me what
you think of that, sir.

04:25.645 --> 04:27.272
It don't appeal to me.

04:27.314 --> 04:29.942
Get the fuck out of here
for a moment, would you, sir?

04:29.983 --> 04:31.814
Byron Samson's
comin' for him.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.580
Sir, would you please
get the fuck out

04:33.620 --> 04:35.781
till we have finished
our previous conversation?

04:35.822 --> 04:37.949
- How many backing his play?
- A dozen, shit-faced.

04:37.991 --> 04:39.788
Samson caved in
Tommy Raymond's head at

04:39.826 --> 04:42.954
- the No-Name Frog. He went against it.
- What are you conversing at?

04:44.564 --> 04:45.895
Jesus Christ!

04:45.932 --> 04:47.957
Come out and talk
to us, Bullock!

04:48.001 --> 04:50.333
Now who is that?
That sounds like Byron Samson.

04:53.473 --> 04:57.000
- Yeah.
- What would he want?

05:09.623 --> 05:12.524
Now tell me what kind
of fuckin' luck I got.

05:15.996 --> 05:19.659
All you're doing stalling,
Bullock, is pissin' me off!

05:19.699 --> 05:23.362
'Cause I guarantee you ain't
making it through in there till sun-up!

05:23.403 --> 05:26.497
So why don't you climb out
from behind your badge,

05:26.539 --> 05:28.336
and your big
brick building,

05:28.375 --> 05:30.502
and you bring
Clell Watson out here

05:30.543 --> 05:33.137
so we can give him
what he fuckin' deserves!

05:35.849 --> 05:37.441
What have we got here?

05:37.484 --> 05:39.213
Whoa!

05:39.252 --> 05:40.913
It's a Jew on a wagon!

05:40.954 --> 05:42.945
Yeah, right out here
in the alley!

05:44.624 --> 05:47.991
I'm executing sentence now
and he's hangin' under color of law.

05:48.028 --> 05:50.496
You and your partner plan on making
Deadwood, Marshal,

05:50.530 --> 05:51.997
do not try for this scaffold.

05:52.032 --> 05:55.468
That's a deal,
you loud-mouthed cocksucker!

05:55.502 --> 05:59.996
You hear this?
Oh! Wait, this ain't right.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.008
My sister was comin'
in the morning.

06:02.042 --> 06:05.671
- What would you have her told?
- That's not enough of a drop.

06:05.712 --> 06:07.703
I'll strangle
for 20 minutes.

06:07.747 --> 06:09.544
I'll help you
with the drop.

06:09.582 --> 06:11.812
Get up and say what you'd
have your sister told.

06:11.851 --> 06:14.046
Do not tether that
rope off of that porch!

06:22.262 --> 06:24.059
Any more gunplay
gets answered.

06:24.097 --> 06:25.997
You called
the law in, Samson.

06:26.032 --> 06:28.000
You don't get to call it off
just 'cause you're liquored up

06:28.034 --> 06:29.558
and popular on payday.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.502
You don't tell us what to do
and what not to do,

06:31.538 --> 06:34.029
'cause you're leaving
Montana anyways!

06:34.074 --> 06:36.599
Now do not jump off
of that stooI, you cocksucker!

06:36.643 --> 06:38.907
Or what?
You'll kill me?

06:40.613 --> 06:42.444
You tell my sister

06:42.482 --> 06:46.009
if my boy turns up,
raise him good.

06:46.052 --> 06:48.350
What else?

06:48.388 --> 06:50.720
Tell her
give him my boots.

06:50.757 --> 06:52.384
What else?

06:52.425 --> 06:55.019
Tell him his...

06:55.061 --> 06:56.688
daddy loved him.

06:56.730 --> 06:58.425
Tell him...

07:00.233 --> 07:02.599
he has
God's forgiveness.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.634
Anything else?

07:07.273 --> 07:10.709
You help me
with my fuckin' fall!

07:10.744 --> 07:12.473
Come ahead.

07:14.247 --> 07:16.181
Fuck you!

07:57.056 --> 07:58.421
Stay back!

08:00.527 --> 08:02.461
Move the fuck back,
while my partner-

08:03.830 --> 08:06.355
while my partner's taking
his sweet-ass time

08:06.399 --> 08:08.833
writing whatever the fuck
he's writing over there!

08:10.036 --> 08:12.027
Who'll give his last words
to the sister?

08:14.674 --> 08:16.972
None of you
better fucking move!

08:17.010 --> 08:20.502
Shit!
I'll do it.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.683
Thank you.

08:40.133 --> 08:43.034
- Let's go.
- Hee.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.081
Move ahead!
Move out of the way!

09:03.122 --> 09:05.784
- Move!
- Jesus Christ, come on!

09:07.460 --> 09:11.191
- What's going on!
- Move it up there!

09:11.231 --> 09:14.689
Same damn wagon that
broke down yesterday, Bill!

09:16.703 --> 09:18.295
That's the hold up, huh?

09:21.007 --> 09:22.998
Same wagon and no damn room
to maneuver.

09:23.042 --> 09:25.374
Sounds like it's
tighter out there

09:25.411 --> 09:28.778
than a bull's ass
in fly season.

09:29.883 --> 09:32.283
- How's your headache?
- Not bad.

09:32.318 --> 09:34.218
You want me
to canvass for whiskey?

09:34.254 --> 09:36.347
That's all right, Jane.

09:36.389 --> 09:38.880
Believe me, we're stuck here
a fucking while.

09:40.026 --> 09:42.187
I know your
canvassing techniques.

09:42.228 --> 09:46.790
I don't want any casualties
on my conscience.

09:54.774 --> 09:56.765
It's only
Wild Bill Hickok

09:56.809 --> 09:58.936
you got stalled here
in the muck!

09:59.979 --> 10:02.174
You ignorant
fucking cunts!

10:07.220 --> 10:09.381
We're out here
the whole goddamn day?

10:09.422 --> 10:12.220
What a goddamn circus!

10:12.258 --> 10:13.850
Shit.

10:18.631 --> 10:21.930
- We've got no water!
- All right, friend.

10:23.303 --> 10:24.793
Let's go!

10:43.022 --> 10:46.048
Come on, now,
come on, now, come on.

11:12.251 --> 11:13.878
Chickens for sale!
$3.00 a pair.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.388
Get your chickens here.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.130
This lot rents
at 20 a day, Seth.

11:30.169 --> 11:34.128
- $20 a day.
- Tent only, no construction.

11:35.141 --> 11:36.608
Corner location.

11:42.115 --> 11:45.243
In advance, every morning,
to Mr. Swearengen at the Gem.

11:45.284 --> 11:47.752
- Where's the Gem?
- You'll find it.

11:47.787 --> 11:49.277
Everybody does.

11:54.861 --> 11:57.796
Eight ounces of gold
at $20 an ounce is 160

11:57.830 --> 12:01.197
plus $10 for a half-ounce
makes 170 total.

12:01.234 --> 12:04.135
Inform your dealers
and whores of my credit,

12:04.170 --> 12:05.728
and pour me
a goddamn drink!

12:05.772 --> 12:07.535
Honor and a pleasure,
my good man.

12:10.710 --> 12:13.110
170 credit, Dan,
for Ellsworth.

12:13.146 --> 12:15.706
Yes, sir,
170 for Ellsworth.

12:15.748 --> 12:17.340
I'll let
everybody know.

12:18.351 --> 12:20.410
Lot four,
some hardware guys.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.088
First one today
with this hand.

12:25.925 --> 12:28.485
And pour me another,
my good man.

12:28.528 --> 12:30.428
Here comes another.

12:31.664 --> 12:34.792
- Lot four a stayer?
- Wagon loaded with goods.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.962
Now with that limey
damn accent of yours,

12:38.004 --> 12:41.531
are these rumors true that you're
descended from the British nobility?

12:41.574 --> 12:43.804
I'm descended from
all of them cocksuckers.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.539
Well here's to you,
Your Majesty.

12:46.579 --> 12:48.740
I'll tell you what,

12:48.781 --> 12:52.512
I may have fucked my life up
flatter than hammered shit,

12:52.552 --> 12:54.281
but I stand here
before you today

12:54.320 --> 12:57.187
beholden to no
human cocksucker,

12:57.223 --> 12:59.817
and working a paying
fucking gold claim.

12:59.859 --> 13:03.590
And not the U.S. government
saying I'm trespassing,

13:03.629 --> 13:06.223
or the savage fucking
red man himself,

13:06.265 --> 13:08.665
or any of these
limber dick cocksuckers

13:08.701 --> 13:12.000
passing themselves off as prospectors
had better try and stop me.

13:13.206 --> 13:15.174
They'd better not
try it in here.

13:16.776 --> 13:20.234
God damn it, Swearengen, I don't trust
you as far as I can throw you,

13:20.279 --> 13:22.611
but I enjoy
the way you lie.

13:22.648 --> 13:25.776
- Thank you, my good man.
- You're welcome,

13:25.818 --> 13:28.150
you conniving,
heavy-thumbed motherfucker!

13:28.187 --> 13:30.178
Watch out!

13:30.223 --> 13:31.850
That's her derringer.

13:31.891 --> 13:35.019
I warned you about
that loopy cunt!

13:35.061 --> 13:36.528
Keep your own tally!

13:36.562 --> 13:39.053
Oh, have no fear
on that score.

13:40.666 --> 13:43.533
I said not to beat on me!
I told him!

13:43.569 --> 13:46.163
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...

13:46.205 --> 13:49.174
- You got any other guns?
- No, I don't got any more.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.802
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...

13:51.844 --> 13:55.007
Ticonderoga, New York-
did you find it?

13:57.884 --> 13:59.374
Barnett Robinson.

13:59.418 --> 14:01.978
That's who to notify
if this thing goes wrong.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.784
Yeah, I've got it
right here.

14:06.359 --> 14:09.988
- How you doing, Trixie?
- I told him, don't beat on me, Doc!

14:10.029 --> 14:12.429
- No one asked for your version!
- Said I robbed him

14:12.465 --> 14:15.662
and he started beating on me.
And I didn't rob you!

14:15.701 --> 14:18.761
- I don't remember.
- I didn't, God damn it!

14:20.439 --> 14:22.270
Aw, she shot me
right in the head.

14:22.308 --> 14:24.868
D- don't put
your fingers in it.

14:26.112 --> 14:29.104
Oh yeah,
is it bad, Doc?

14:30.816 --> 14:33.011
Shh, shh, shh.

14:52.371 --> 14:54.339
Get the Chinaman!

14:54.373 --> 14:58.571
Sure would like to know
how he lasted for 20 minutes.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.738
Shot straight to the brain.

15:01.781 --> 15:04.079
So prospect in him
till Dan brings the Chinaman.

15:04.116 --> 15:05.845
Do you mind if I take him
to my place?

15:05.885 --> 15:08.353
Sure. Help the doc with this guy, bring
the Chinaman to the Doc's.

15:08.387 --> 15:10.321
I'll bring that
sled right in, Doc.

15:10.356 --> 15:13.689
Doc,
you drink free today.

15:13.726 --> 15:15.591
And I hope
any word of this

15:15.628 --> 15:17.596
would keep the gun
out of the whore's hand.

15:19.265 --> 15:22.666
- That wouldn't come from me.
- Bastard did himself in.

15:22.702 --> 15:25.262
- Come here.
- I said to stop.

15:25.304 --> 15:26.965
Tell me in my office.

15:27.006 --> 15:29.167
Get the gimp
to clean this place up.

15:36.649 --> 15:38.617
Ugh, Doc!

15:43.089 --> 15:44.920
You know
there's something

15:44.957 --> 15:46.948
peculiar about
this man's cerebral setup

15:46.993 --> 15:49.052
or they can just
write off the forebrain

15:49.095 --> 15:52.587
as being the center
of thought and speech.

15:52.632 --> 15:54.691
Let's just get him
on the sled.

15:56.235 --> 15:57.896
Of course it...

15:57.937 --> 16:00.201
won't matter
to Mr. Wu's pigs.

16:11.050 --> 16:12.881
Whiskey.

16:16.389 --> 16:19.187
I've got an urge to see
that camp, Charlie.

16:20.326 --> 16:22.521
All right...

16:22.561 --> 16:25.086
- Can we leave you with the stock, Jane?
- Yeah.

16:25.131 --> 16:27.190
Bill and me are gonna
ride ahead into camp.

16:27.233 --> 16:29.758
I expect I'll be there
before sundown.

16:29.802 --> 16:31.667
Well, we'll know
where to find you.

16:31.704 --> 16:34.298
What in the hell
do you mean by that?

16:34.340 --> 16:36.205
That I enjoy
a fucking drink?

16:36.242 --> 16:37.869
I wasn't aware
that's outlawed.

16:37.910 --> 16:40.242
Thanks for looking
to the stock, Jane.

16:42.281 --> 16:44.841
Excuse my ill humor.

16:44.884 --> 16:47.375
Certain people wear
on my fucking nerves.

17:04.369 --> 17:06.270
She likes me better
than she likes you.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.965
I wish to hell I knew
what I ever did

17:10.009 --> 17:12.034
to get on that woman's
wrong side.

17:20.118 --> 17:22.747
- You know a back way into the camp?
- Whoa.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.254
We don't go
to the camp.

17:29.295 --> 17:31.991
We go home-
back to Minnesota.

17:32.031 --> 17:35.899
You probably
got the right idea.

17:44.677 --> 17:47.009
Jesus Christ Almighty,
move it!

17:47.046 --> 17:49.207
I can't get to my spot
until you finish!

17:49.248 --> 17:52.274
You got me circling my wagon
like a fly around shit.

17:52.318 --> 17:55.776
We're pretty near done.
We gotta long wait, same as you.

17:55.821 --> 17:57.880
This the first wagon
you ever fucking unloaded?!

17:57.923 --> 18:00.323
Hold on to my horse,
I'll show you how to do it!

18:00.359 --> 18:03.954
We know what we're doing. Put your hat
back on and stick with your wagon.

18:03.996 --> 18:08.524
- And what if I don't?
- Stand there mouthing off and find out.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.034
Sir...

18:11.604 --> 18:13.595
I have a commode
for your inconvenience.

18:13.639 --> 18:16.130
- You think I'm gonna pay for that?
- No, that's free.

18:16.175 --> 18:19.576
from Star & Bullock Hardware,
open in Deadwood soon as we locate.

18:23.549 --> 18:25.244
Hurry up
and get finished!

18:34.560 --> 18:36.619
My father's last words
there in Vienna,

18:36.662 --> 18:39.654
before he passed away,

18:39.698 --> 18:42.599
was "SoI, lose a can
to buy the goddamned fooI.

18:42.635 --> 18:44.762
You could slow it down
and sell 'em at retail."

18:44.804 --> 18:47.898
I gotta put a book together
of your old man's deathbed sayings.

18:47.940 --> 18:50.465
That was Wild Bill Hickok
just riding past us, Seth.

18:50.509 --> 18:52.500
I seen him in photographs.

18:54.079 --> 18:55.910
He lost his
stake gambling.

18:55.948 --> 18:58.075
He told me before
he passed out.

18:58.117 --> 19:00.779
He said he lost his stake
and he hadn't found no gold

19:00.820 --> 19:03.550
and he was going back East
after one last piece of pussy.

19:03.589 --> 19:05.079
None of that's
anything to me.

19:05.124 --> 19:08.560
He wakes back up,
starts in beating on me.

19:08.594 --> 19:10.562
Where's his stake,
where's all his money?

19:10.596 --> 19:12.291
You call Danny,
you call Johnny.

19:12.331 --> 19:14.231
Must've been me
who took it from him.

19:14.266 --> 19:16.928
You don't shoot nobody 'cause
that's bad for my business

19:16.969 --> 19:19.733
and it's bad for
the camp's reputation.

19:21.073 --> 19:23.371
He beat the living shit
out of you, didn't he?

19:25.244 --> 19:27.144
Do what you
gotta do to me.

19:27.179 --> 19:29.841
Don't tell me
what to do.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.284
Either way this comes out,
we'll only have to do it once.

19:37.323 --> 19:39.484
What's it to be,
Trixie?

19:43.529 --> 19:45.019
I'll be good.

19:48.534 --> 19:50.263
All right now.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.452
We heard rumors
you might be coming,

20:07.486 --> 20:09.477
but you can't believe
every rumor.

20:09.522 --> 20:12.047
We heard you might be
coming from Cheyenne.

20:12.091 --> 20:14.582
- Here I am.
- If every rumor was true

20:14.627 --> 20:16.857
we'd all have been
scalped now by the Sioux,

20:16.896 --> 20:20.024
or the government would've tossed us out
as treaty violators.

20:24.136 --> 20:27.333
- E.B. Farnum, how do you do?
- Charlie Utter.

20:28.941 --> 20:32.570
You got some mighty
clammy hands there, partner.

20:32.611 --> 20:35.079
Damp palms run
in my family.

20:36.749 --> 20:39.741
Here to prospect, Mr. Hickok,
or on other business?

20:39.785 --> 20:41.946
I'm here
to get a room.

20:41.987 --> 20:45.923
Could we get two?
We're worn out looking at each other.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.721
Separate rooms.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.957
I'll arrange that by tomorrow,
but today I can't fix it.

20:53.198 --> 20:55.132
Unless you
kill a guest.

21:05.311 --> 21:08.303
Wild Bill Hickok.

21:08.347 --> 21:10.474
Nothing can
ever be simple.

21:10.516 --> 21:13.144
He didn't speak of having
lawman ambitions, Al.

21:13.185 --> 21:15.551
Starting with Custer
getting himself massacred,

21:15.588 --> 21:17.317
it's been one thing
after another.

21:17.356 --> 21:20.154
Leaves the godless savage cocksucker
Sioux on the warpath-

21:20.192 --> 21:22.786
if that long-haired
loudmouth had held his end up,

21:22.828 --> 21:24.557
we could be operating
here in peace.

21:24.597 --> 21:26.622
The New York dude's
downstairs, Al.

21:26.665 --> 21:29.725
- Did he order whiskey?
- Yeah.

21:29.768 --> 21:32.828
Did he down it
or is he sipping at it?

21:32.871 --> 21:34.566
He's sipping.

21:34.607 --> 21:37.508
Why'd I even ask, huh?

21:37.543 --> 21:39.443
Go get Tim Driscoll.

21:39.478 --> 21:41.309
Make sure the dude
sees you leave.

21:41.347 --> 21:43.508
- What should I tell Tim?
- Tell him to get over here.

21:43.549 --> 21:46.211
Tell him he's drunk,
sorry for himself, give me five minutes,

21:46.251 --> 21:48.685
- then you come back, do your part.
- All right, Al.

21:52.057 --> 21:53.547
As far as Hickok, Al,

21:53.592 --> 21:55.958
if I'd have pushed him
any harder on his plans,

21:55.995 --> 21:57.986
I was afraid
he'd shoot me.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.031
- Go get Driscoll.
- Yes, sir.

22:06.038 --> 22:07.335
Handmade!

22:07.373 --> 22:09.739
It's all handmade,
guaranteed.

22:09.775 --> 22:12.471
It ain't like something's
being foisted on 'em

22:12.511 --> 22:14.502
they'll be sorry
they bought come sun-up.

22:15.648 --> 22:18.640
- I know that.
- These are quality items.

22:18.684 --> 22:20.447
They meet
these folk's needs-

22:20.486 --> 22:23.887
offered at fair markup,
and we're announcing their availability.

22:23.922 --> 22:26.447
Brought through Indian country
figures into the markup.

22:26.492 --> 22:29.154
By us,
at personal peril.

22:31.463 --> 22:33.192
Let's go.

22:33.232 --> 22:36.099
Coming out with your fly down
might strike the wrong note.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.889
Come have a look, boys.

23:02.928 --> 23:05.192
Star & Bullock
Hardware and Mercantile

23:05.230 --> 23:07.425
just opened for business.

23:07.466 --> 23:09.024
We got boots
to sell you.

23:13.672 --> 23:16.835
Knee-boots, $10!
Hip-boots, 15!

23:16.875 --> 23:19.070
We got picks,
pans and shovels.

23:19.111 --> 23:22.945
Picks at $12,
shovels at 10, and pans at 8!

23:22.981 --> 23:26.075
We got plaster cradles,
prospector's best friend.

23:26.118 --> 23:28.086
Perfected at
the Montana strikes!

23:28.120 --> 23:29.678
We got chamber-pots
to sell you.

23:29.722 --> 23:31.451
If you don't know
what one of those is,

23:31.490 --> 23:34.118
the man living next to you
will appreciate your finding out.

23:34.159 --> 23:37.128
I'll look at your
biggest size hip-boot.

23:37.162 --> 23:40.131
- Got 'em right here.
- We stand by our stock.

23:40.165 --> 23:42.326
Any item that don't do
what it's supposed to

23:42.367 --> 23:44.164
will be exchanged
for one that does.

23:44.203 --> 23:45.966
And we'll be here
for you to find us.

23:46.004 --> 23:48.199
Son of a bitch!

23:48.240 --> 23:50.708
The man said I might
get a prize.

23:50.743 --> 23:53.405
I paid 50¢
for this bar of soap,

23:53.445 --> 23:57.404
there's a $5 prize
in the wrapper.

23:57.449 --> 24:00.714
- Where'd you buy that soap at?
- Man standing right over there.

24:00.753 --> 24:04.519
Front your game
away from our tent.

24:09.128 --> 24:11.995
Cash prizes,
every night's case of soap.

24:12.030 --> 24:13.588
Hey, storekeep!

24:13.632 --> 24:16.396
Hold me some of those
large hip-boots till I get over there

24:16.435 --> 24:19.927
- and I'll pay you $2 extra.
- Set prices, boys,

24:19.972 --> 24:22.167
and first come,
first to be served.

24:23.475 --> 24:25.204
We'll get you
squared away.

24:40.325 --> 24:42.987
No free feels
in this house.

24:43.028 --> 24:46.020
Brom Garret
of Manhattan,

24:46.064 --> 24:48.362
scourge of the Deadwood
faro tables.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.425
Don't think I
confuse two nights

24:50.469 --> 24:52.369
holding good cards
with being a faro shark.

24:52.404 --> 24:53.735
Two here, Dan.

24:54.773 --> 24:57.037
You... you see
a finish to that?

25:02.147 --> 25:04.138
Did you hear
Bill Hickok's in town?

25:04.183 --> 25:08.017
Oh yes, I did.
Does that give you the vapors?

25:09.955 --> 25:12.014
Are you mad
about something, Al?

25:12.057 --> 25:13.581
I'm not mad
about nothing.

25:15.127 --> 25:17.960
AII's I can tell you, things sort out
fast in Deadwood.

25:17.996 --> 25:21.227
I vouched for you with Tim Driscoll
two hours in here last night

25:21.266 --> 25:23.860
when I gather you must have
been home in bed, sleeping.

25:23.902 --> 25:27.235
End result, Tim's just
about got his claim sold to E.B. Farnum.

25:27.272 --> 25:30.673
What? Where's
Driscoll now?

25:30.709 --> 25:33.439
He ain't here
so I'd assume at his hoteI.

25:33.478 --> 25:36.345
- You told me he's here by 6:00.
- He ain't yet.

25:36.381 --> 25:39.544
Al, E.B. Farnum just saw me here
and headed for the door.

25:39.585 --> 25:42.019
I wouldn't know how
to interpret that.

25:43.288 --> 25:45.256
I was doing
the legwork, Al.

25:45.290 --> 25:46.917
I was doing
the due diligence.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.052
You tell me Driscoll's
got money troubles,

25:49.094 --> 25:51.062
and he's a motivated
seller, fair enough.

25:51.096 --> 25:53.030
But how did I know his
claim's not played out?

25:53.065 --> 25:55.090
- I had to do the legwork.
- I see, fair enough.

25:55.133 --> 25:58.193
- Oh that's what I had to ascertain.
- Did you do the legwork?

25:59.938 --> 26:01.565
Al.

26:06.111 --> 26:07.703
For God's sake,
close your fist.

26:07.746 --> 26:11.182
Cleaned up during the night
with five more just like it

26:11.216 --> 26:13.582
from Claim No. 9
above Discovery,

26:13.619 --> 26:15.246
panned
at the Driscoll claim.

26:16.889 --> 26:20.052
AII I can say, Brom,
while you were out winning the battle

26:20.092 --> 26:22.219
I hope you didn't lose
the fucking war.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.490
Al.

26:31.570 --> 26:33.435
Who is that?

26:36.241 --> 26:38.436
Tim Driscoll...

26:38.477 --> 26:40.274
shit-faced.

26:40.312 --> 26:42.507
Let me handle
the play.

26:42.547 --> 26:44.981
Oh my God,
he is shit-faced.

27:11.777 --> 27:14.712
- Boys?
- Whiskeys.

27:14.746 --> 27:16.304
Two whiskeys.

27:18.517 --> 27:21.077
I'm- I'm respecting
your privacy

27:21.119 --> 27:23.986
not saying your name,
but I certainly recognize you

27:24.022 --> 27:26.217
and I'd like
to buy the round.

27:26.258 --> 27:30.058
- Charlie Utter.
- Tom Nuttall, Charlie.

27:30.095 --> 27:31.619
Tom.

27:31.663 --> 27:34.655
It's Bill Hickok.
I seen him kill Phil Coe in Abilene.

27:34.700 --> 27:38.136
Ahem, A.W. Merrick,
Mr. Hickok,

27:38.170 --> 27:40.400
of the...
"Deadwood Pioneer. "

27:43.008 --> 27:45.203
- We're drinking whiskey.
- Certainly.

27:45.243 --> 27:48.178
Certainly.
Whiskeys here, Mr. Nuttall.

27:48.213 --> 27:51.080
I'm gonna say one thing
before anybody opens their mouth,

27:51.116 --> 27:53.016
and I won't say
no more on the subject,

27:53.051 --> 27:55.281
and I'll be through
for the fucking evening...

27:56.488 --> 27:58.479
I'm not impressed.

27:58.523 --> 28:03.051
So what brings you
to our camp, Mr. Hickok?

28:03.095 --> 28:04.494
May I tell my readers?

28:04.529 --> 28:06.861
Warrant out on me
in Cheyenne.

28:06.898 --> 28:09.025
Aw, get off
of that now, Bill.

28:09.067 --> 28:10.864
Well, I suppose
for a man like you,

28:10.902 --> 28:12.836
warrants are
a vocational hazard.

28:12.871 --> 28:15.339
Calling me
a professional vagrant.

28:15.374 --> 28:18.707
- The warrant was for vagrancy?
- He's kidding!

28:26.018 --> 28:28.486
Anyway, in this camp,
warrants don't count.

28:28.520 --> 28:32.251
I'm telling you he's
not impressed, all right?

28:32.290 --> 28:36.590
Now you may apply that
to whoever you feeI may be my reference.

28:36.628 --> 28:40.223
And I intend to gut that son of a bitch
at poker whenever I get the chance.

28:40.265 --> 28:43.564
You run that game?
Can I buy 50 in chips?

28:43.602 --> 28:45.433
I do and you can.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.700
Just settle up
after you see how your luck runs.

28:47.739 --> 28:50.765
FeeI like playing now, Bill, or you
wanna take in the rest of the camp?

28:50.809 --> 28:52.436
I feeI like
playing now.

28:52.477 --> 28:54.604
Draw and five stud.

28:54.646 --> 28:57.615
Dealer calls the game.

28:57.649 --> 29:00.550
Sounds fair.
See you later, Charlie.

29:00.585 --> 29:02.849
All right, Bill.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.556
- You boys mind if I sit in?
- Not at all, have a seat.

29:10.695 --> 29:12.560
What a grand surprise.

29:12.597 --> 29:15.259
I never thought he'd live
long enough for me to meet him.

29:30.115 --> 29:32.015
I need another gun.

29:34.352 --> 29:37.446
What, in case
they beat on you?

29:37.489 --> 29:42.119
Never mind what for,
just take this and get me another gun.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.323
Go on, you can touch
my nipples if you want to.

29:45.363 --> 29:48.355
Now MabeI! MabeI!
Get your ass across that table!

29:48.400 --> 29:50.425
This dollar
is not for drink.

29:50.469 --> 29:53.996
- My name's Caroline.
- Well, you'll always be MabeI to me.

29:54.039 --> 29:57.770
Claim No. 9 above Discovery,
$14,000, yes or no?

29:57.809 --> 30:00.972
$14,000,
yes or no?

30:01.012 --> 30:04.675
All right, we'll
make it 14,000.

30:04.716 --> 30:06.149
Spit in your hand.

30:07.786 --> 30:09.845
Spit in your hand.

30:09.888 --> 30:13.483
- What's his fucking problem?
- Aw, nothing.

30:13.525 --> 30:15.516
Done, witnessed.

30:16.995 --> 30:18.963
- Am I too late?
- Mm.

30:18.997 --> 30:21.693
No, no, no, but you're
too late Farnum.

30:21.733 --> 30:25.134
I just sold to this goose-looking
fella for 14,000.

30:25.170 --> 30:28.264
- Will you take 16?
- No, thank you, but no.

30:28.306 --> 30:31.798
What a fucking
Iying cunt you are.

30:31.843 --> 30:33.538
"12 and a half
thousand-

30:33.578 --> 30:36.069
that's every cent
I can get hold of, Mr. Driscoll.

30:36.114 --> 30:38.309
And more than
the claim is worth" you said.

30:38.350 --> 30:41.786
16,000, that's 2,000 profit,
standing over a drink.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.721
I believe events will prove
that Claim No. 9 above Discovery

30:44.756 --> 30:47.350
was worth far more
than 16,000, Mr. Farnum.

30:47.392 --> 30:48.916
Unhand me, Al.

30:50.762 --> 30:53.993
Though, you know, of course,
I haven't actually seen

30:54.032 --> 30:57.991
- his fucking money yet.
- I'm discounting his banknote. Dan.

30:59.137 --> 31:00.365
There's $10,000.

31:00.405 --> 31:02.669
I'll weigh four
out of the other sack right now.

31:02.707 --> 31:04.732
Al's holding
a full faith letter of credit

31:04.776 --> 31:06.539
for $20,000 from
the Bank of New York.

31:06.578 --> 31:08.637
Full faith is one thing,
but until the money

31:08.680 --> 31:11.843
has actually passed hands between us,
the deal isn't done.

31:11.883 --> 31:13.748
- The deal is done.
- The deal isn't done.

31:13.785 --> 31:15.650
- The deal is done.
- We spat in our hands.

31:15.687 --> 31:17.382
What the fuck
would you know?!

31:17.422 --> 31:19.947
I'll knock you into
the middle of next week.

31:19.991 --> 31:23.051
Now, would you offer me
the 16,000?

31:23.094 --> 31:25.324
I suppose, if you're open
to further offers.

31:25.363 --> 31:26.455
16,500.

31:26.498 --> 31:29.092
- What the fuck did you just do?
- Will you close at 16.5?

31:29.134 --> 31:31.602
- You just reopened the fucking bidding.
- 17,000.

31:31.636 --> 31:33.797
17,500,
I'll go no farther.

31:33.838 --> 31:35.362
- 18!
- 19!

31:35.407 --> 31:39.343
19,800 and that's every cent
I can put together.

31:39.377 --> 31:40.776
20,000.

31:40.812 --> 31:42.871
Damn it!
Damn it!

31:42.914 --> 31:45.314
20 once.

31:45.350 --> 31:46.977
- 20 twice.
- I can't.

31:47.018 --> 31:48.679
It's over,
he's through.

31:49.854 --> 31:52.880
- Is it over?
- All right.

31:52.924 --> 31:56.951
20,000 sold to the goose-looking man
in the shiny suit.

31:56.995 --> 31:59.259
- I got it, Al.
- Yes, you did.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.267
Comes to look for
a business opportunity,

32:12.310 --> 32:13.868
and sits there
losing at poker.

32:13.912 --> 32:16.813
Is he having a bad run?
I can't see that far.

32:16.848 --> 32:18.873
You'd have to see
back to Cheyenne.

32:18.917 --> 32:20.908
He lost his patience,

32:20.952 --> 32:23.477
stays in hands whether
he's holding cards or not.

32:25.390 --> 32:27.483
How's your crowd in here
tonight, anyway?

32:29.027 --> 32:30.722
Oh, it's all right.

32:30.762 --> 32:33.390
It's better than all right,
you could see that much.

32:33.431 --> 32:36.764
Bill Hickok's an asset to any saloon,
any joint he frequents.

32:36.801 --> 32:40.601
- You agree with me on that or not?
- You got a say in that?

32:40.639 --> 32:44.336
- As far as where he drinks and gambles?
- Suppose I did?

32:47.445 --> 32:50.107
50 a night if he'll
frequent here exclusive.

32:50.148 --> 32:52.844
50?

32:52.884 --> 32:55.045
What a sport
you turned out to be.

32:56.921 --> 32:59.754
- You quote a figure.
- Let's come to one understanding.

32:59.791 --> 33:02.817
Any figure I would've come up with,
part of that you give to him

33:02.861 --> 33:05.421
to gamble or piss away
however else he's gonna do it.

33:05.463 --> 33:07.795
That'd be the only part
he'd know about.

33:07.832 --> 33:09.265
I'd work with you.

33:09.301 --> 33:12.896
The rest you'd give to me
to hold in trust for his future.

33:14.472 --> 33:17.600
- Now that'd be your affair.
- Listen to me,

33:17.642 --> 33:20.110
that man's
recently married.

33:20.145 --> 33:22.136
He needs to put
a stake together.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.478
That's all
I'd be in this for.

33:25.917 --> 33:28.408
I'd work with you.

33:43.034 --> 33:44.524
Banish all headaches.

33:44.569 --> 33:47.265
Spit in your hand,
Alma!

33:47.305 --> 33:49.296
- What?
- Spit.

33:49.341 --> 33:51.206
I'm gonna
show you something.

33:52.977 --> 33:55.741
Promise you'll tell
my mother about this.

33:55.780 --> 33:58.078
I bought it.

33:58.116 --> 34:01.142
We own a gold claim.
This is how we sealed the deal.

34:01.186 --> 34:03.313
And then did everyone
dry their hands?

34:03.355 --> 34:05.846
Do you know who
I was bidding against?

34:05.890 --> 34:08.916
Farnum, who owns
this hoteI.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.621
Oh and where was
your secret agent?

34:11.663 --> 34:14.530
Dan Dority?
He was tending bar.

34:14.565 --> 34:18.696
No one realized how Dan had helped me
wreck and order the claim.

34:18.737 --> 34:21.467
Now Swearengen-
runs the saloon-

34:21.505 --> 34:25.306
he was intermediary,
he brokered the deal.

34:25.342 --> 34:27.971
Driscoll, the seller,
legless with liquor.

34:28.012 --> 34:30.105
You will have a vivid
entry for an article

34:30.148 --> 34:31.877
and I've told you
all the details.

34:31.916 --> 34:34.384
Yes, I've already
begun to imagine it.

34:35.387 --> 34:37.911
It was a near thing
till the end.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.891
I had to go all our 20,000
to turn Farnum away.

34:40.925 --> 34:43.416
Oh well.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.895
I'll have to write the bank
to renew my credit.

34:46.998 --> 34:49.694
Of course
they'll contact Father.

34:50.935 --> 34:52.994
Well...

34:54.139 --> 34:56.197
I expect
that's inevitable.

34:58.610 --> 35:01.602
Wild Bill Hickok
is here.

35:01.646 --> 35:04.945
I'm sure he's going
to prospect too.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.611
- How much do you want?
- Well, we agreed on 30%.

35:38.650 --> 35:40.845
- 30% of 20 would be six.
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.885 --> 35:42.250
So I want
the 6,000.

35:42.287 --> 35:44.551
What's 30% of 14,000?

35:46.157 --> 35:49.524
- What the fuck, Al?
- Who told you to take him to 20?

35:52.163 --> 35:54.256
Well, I could feeI that
he had more in him.

35:54.299 --> 35:56.460
It was just a spontaneous
fucking feeling

35:56.501 --> 35:58.332
and I knew that
there was more to get.

35:58.369 --> 36:02.305
And you thought six more would be
the jackpot, take him from 14 to 20.

36:02.340 --> 36:05.070
Oh Jesus Christ, you know,
if you had further plans,

36:05.109 --> 36:07.373
I wish you'd have just
said something to me.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.937
Should I tell you
when I plan to take a shit tomorrow

36:09.981 --> 36:12.211
or would that be none
of your fucking business?

36:18.957 --> 36:22.120
So... 14,000.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.857
30% of that's what-
what is that now... 4,200.

36:29.968 --> 36:32.630
What the fuck arrangement
do you suggest now?

36:32.670 --> 36:35.468
- What do you suggest?
- Oh Jesus Christ Almighty!

36:35.507 --> 36:39.375
You get in a mood like this and I just
as soon as not even discuss it.

36:39.410 --> 36:41.810
Look, let me just
have 500, you know,

36:41.846 --> 36:44.542
and we'll discuss the rest of it
some other fucking time.

36:44.582 --> 36:47.608
Cash or credit
at the tables?

36:47.652 --> 36:51.554
Fucking time of trial, the fucking
English in you comes out. Fine.

36:51.589 --> 36:55.116
I'll have the 500 at the fucking tables
then. Jesus Christ Almighty!

36:55.159 --> 36:58.617
- Are we holding markers?
- You're holding markers, all right.

36:58.663 --> 37:02.224
You've been holding markers against
my kind for the past several centuries,

37:02.267 --> 37:05.236
across both sides of the fucking water!
How the fuck do I know?!

37:05.270 --> 37:07.636
Ask Dority,
he'll know better than me.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.238
Credit it against
the fucking markers,

37:12.277 --> 37:15.610
but just let me hold 20,
in fucking cash.

37:17.849 --> 37:20.943
- Tell Dan to give you 20.
- And a piece of fucking pussy.

37:20.985 --> 37:23.453
Tell Dan, then tell him
to come see me.

37:26.157 --> 37:29.354
And thanks for stepping in on the side
of right and fucking justice,

37:29.394 --> 37:31.521
you deaf dumb bastard!

37:36.301 --> 37:39.498
I tell you, Al, you could
have knocked me over with a feather

37:39.537 --> 37:40.799
when he took him to 20.

37:40.838 --> 37:43.102
Did you see me struggling
to stay on the path?

37:45.810 --> 37:49.041
My wife and children
are in Louisville, Kentucky.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.514
I'm saving
to bring them out.

37:51.549 --> 37:54.450
Days I dig on
the Foster's water ditch

37:54.485 --> 37:58.546
and nights I watch folk's goods
like I'm going to do for yours.

37:58.590 --> 38:01.787
Schedule like that seems like you'll
have 'em here in no time.

38:03.494 --> 38:07.260
Then sabbaths I preach Christ crucified
and raised from the dead.

38:11.235 --> 38:13.294
I'm from Etobicoke,
Ontario.

38:13.338 --> 38:17.900
- So you were born in Canada?
- I come to Montana when I was 17.

38:17.942 --> 38:21.343
- That's when I met up with Mr. Star.
- Is that so?

38:21.379 --> 38:23.506
I was born in Austria.

38:23.548 --> 38:27.780
Austria? WonderfuI
where people come from.

38:27.819 --> 38:31.653
I was born in Austria and then
I grew up in Chillicothe, Ohio.

38:31.689 --> 38:34.886
And then you partnered
with Mr. Bullock in Montana?

38:34.926 --> 38:37.588
That's where
we partnered up.

38:37.629 --> 38:40.063
The Lord is
our final comfort,

38:40.098 --> 38:43.829
but it's a solace
having friends.

38:43.868 --> 38:47.133
I know that
from past experience.

38:50.208 --> 38:52.699
You sure sold up a storm
here tonight, didn't you?

38:52.744 --> 38:55.679
- We did all right.
- We'll be a few hours, Mr. Smith.

38:55.713 --> 38:57.442
We want to look
around the camp.

38:57.482 --> 39:00.212
I will watch your goods
as if they were my own.

39:03.755 --> 39:06.087
- Thank you, Mr. Smith.
- Thank you.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.453
Whoa.

39:16.567 --> 39:18.797
I seen a terrible
thing tonight.

39:18.836 --> 39:20.497
What'd you see?

39:20.538 --> 39:23.803
I seen white people
dead and scalped and...

39:23.841 --> 39:26.901
men, women, and children
with their arms and legs hacked off.

39:26.944 --> 39:29.174
Where? How many dead?

39:29.213 --> 39:32.182
Well, it was a whole family
on the road to Spearfish.

39:32.216 --> 39:35.947
Oh my God, it's them heathen
bloodthirsty savages!

39:35.987 --> 39:40.321
- How many was it died?
- It was the whole family, they was...

39:40.358 --> 39:42.223
hacked and mutilated.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.989
The parents,
two children.

39:44.028 --> 39:46.826
The Metz family
took the Spearfish road

39:46.864 --> 39:49.162
going home to Minnesota.

39:50.902 --> 39:52.995
Then that was
probably them then.

39:53.037 --> 39:57.064
They had three children.
Were there three?

39:58.276 --> 40:00.176
There could've
been three 'cause-

40:00.211 --> 40:03.271
they was all hacked...
and spread around.

40:04.282 --> 40:06.079
Rest their souls.

40:07.652 --> 40:10.678
- Rest their souls.
- Yeah.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.722
You probably
need a drink.

40:24.702 --> 40:26.465
You called my bluff, Hickok.

40:26.504 --> 40:29.132
I was trying
to run one. Whoa!

40:29.173 --> 40:33.439
Wait on Mary.
I got a third eight under there.

40:34.679 --> 40:36.647
Three eights wins,
your pot.

40:36.681 --> 40:40.412
- Oh I absolutely did not realize that.
- Your chips.

40:40.451 --> 40:43.477
Here I am thinking I'm fucking
bluffing the third eight,

40:43.521 --> 40:46.922
and I mistakenly outdraw
the greatest gunfighter in the world.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.257
Meaning the third eight.

40:52.163 --> 40:55.496
- What?
- Saying you outdrew me.

40:55.533 --> 40:57.330
You meant
the third eight.

40:59.170 --> 41:00.933
Well, what else
would I have meant?

41:00.972 --> 41:03.065
Say it.

41:03.107 --> 41:05.940
Then we'll play cards.

41:07.645 --> 41:10.205
Third eight's
what I meant.

41:12.550 --> 41:14.916
- Deal.
- Ante's up, same again.

41:22.460 --> 41:26.294
Jesus Christ, can we
shake hands or something?

41:26.330 --> 41:28.491
Relieve the atmosphere?

41:29.867 --> 41:31.858
I mean, how stupid
do you think I am?

41:31.903 --> 41:35.805
I don't know.
I just met you.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.968
The paradox is the massacre
at Little Big Horn

41:39.010 --> 41:41.274
signaled the Indians'
death throes, Mr. Utter.

41:41.312 --> 41:44.304
History has overtaken the treaty
which gave them this land.

41:44.348 --> 41:47.317
Well, the gold we found
has overtaken it.

41:47.351 --> 41:49.046
I believe within a year

41:49.086 --> 41:51.452
Congress will rescind
the Fort Laramie Treaty,

41:51.489 --> 41:53.457
Deadwood and these hills
will be annexed

41:53.491 --> 41:56.892
to the Dakota Territory,
and we who have pursued our destiny

41:56.928 --> 41:58.691
outside law or statute

41:58.729 --> 42:01.357
will be restored
to the bosom of the nation.

42:01.399 --> 42:04.562
And... that's
what I believe.

42:13.177 --> 42:16.772
- Does bosom mean tit?
- Same thing.

42:18.082 --> 42:20.107
Ain't nothing
against y'all fellas,

42:20.151 --> 42:22.847
but I'd as soon do my drinking
and getting a piece of ass.

42:22.887 --> 42:25.151
First you want people
to know about that family.

42:25.189 --> 42:28.352
Yeah, well, what harm is it
in me meeting my needs

42:28.392 --> 42:30.417
before I circulate
the news?

42:30.461 --> 42:32.895
What if the third
child is alive?

42:32.930 --> 42:35.831
You listen, mister,
it was a massacre.

42:35.867 --> 42:38.768
I'm the one who saw it.
And there ain't no one was alive.

42:38.803 --> 42:41.328
Did you see
the massacre or not?

42:41.372 --> 42:43.363
I told you I got there
afterwards.

42:43.407 --> 42:45.204
So by then, the child
could've got away

42:45.243 --> 42:47.040
from where you saw
those other bodies?

42:47.078 --> 42:48.875
Or the child
could've been hiding

42:48.913 --> 42:51.541
and so afraid of
who you might be, it didn't call out.

42:51.582 --> 42:54.642
You listen to me, I ain't going back
out there again tonight,

42:54.685 --> 42:56.880
so you mind your own
goddamn business!

42:56.921 --> 42:59.412
You're saying a family
is massacred by Indians

42:59.457 --> 43:02.358
on the road to Spearfish
and one child may still be alive

43:02.393 --> 43:05.294
- and it's no one's concern-
- What's this about a massacre?

43:05.329 --> 43:07.297
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn it!

43:07.331 --> 43:09.322
I ain't going out there
again tonight

43:09.367 --> 43:13.269
after I just made camp with my scalp
by sheer dumb fucking luck!

43:15.072 --> 43:17.063
Ride out and show us
the place.

43:26.050 --> 43:28.143
I'll guarantee
your scalp.

43:32.623 --> 43:35.148
- You riding?
- Yeah.

43:36.227 --> 43:38.286
- We'll ride.
- May I ride?

43:38.329 --> 43:40.923
I'd be honored to ride,
infirmities permitting.

43:42.199 --> 43:43.632
Here we go.

43:55.513 --> 43:58.607
Wild Bill
fucking Hickok.

43:59.817 --> 44:01.717
You were a marshal
in Kansas?

44:01.752 --> 44:03.652
Yeah.

44:03.688 --> 44:06.316
- And you?
- Montana.

44:06.357 --> 44:10.123
- Come to your senses now?
- Yes, sir.

44:11.796 --> 44:14.560
The fella's story on this
don't hold water.

44:14.598 --> 44:17.032
No, it don't.

44:22.673 --> 44:25.608
- What'd you give Driscoll?
- 20 bucks.

44:25.643 --> 44:27.338
Free poke with Wanda.

44:27.378 --> 44:30.506
- Half-smart mick that he is.
- Yeah.

44:30.548 --> 44:32.743
Tim really fucked up
with the dude, huh?

44:32.783 --> 44:35.581
I guess the dude's case money.
Dude only out here three days.

44:35.619 --> 44:37.883
How's the dude ask
his people back home for more?

44:37.922 --> 44:41.016
- They're liable to send the Pinkertons.
- So shut the dude down?

44:41.058 --> 44:42.958
You being
his secret best friend,

44:42.994 --> 44:45.758
he'll want you out prospecting
in the morning beside him.

44:45.796 --> 44:47.388
That claim needs
to pinch out.

44:47.431 --> 44:49.991
Oughtn't take but a couple days,
he ain't got much sand.

44:50.034 --> 44:52.366
Tim Driscoll
needs to be seen to.

44:53.904 --> 44:55.565
- No kidding now?
- No kidding.

44:57.274 --> 44:59.174
Well, not that
anybody asked,

44:59.210 --> 45:01.974
but I'd look to Trixie
for danger before I'd look to Tim.

45:02.013 --> 45:03.844
No kidding!

45:05.449 --> 45:08.885
Jimmy says the Sioux massacred a family
on the Spearfish road.

45:08.919 --> 45:10.887
A hand come into
Nuttall's No. 10

45:10.921 --> 45:13.481
- telling the story, Mr. Swearengen.
- Who was he?

45:13.524 --> 45:15.321
- I never seen him before.
- Can you get him over here?

45:15.359 --> 45:17.088
Is he still at Nuttall's?

45:17.128 --> 45:19.392
They're riding back out
to where it happened.

45:19.430 --> 45:21.591
Hickok and some others
were riding with him.

45:21.632 --> 45:24.499
Did the hand look happy
to be riding back out with Hickok?

45:24.535 --> 45:26.469
He didn't look
too happy.

45:26.504 --> 45:30.167
How many people downstairs
did you tell about this?

45:31.609 --> 45:33.577
- A few.
- A few?

45:35.279 --> 45:38.874
You let him tell a few people downstairs
before you bring this to me?

45:38.916 --> 45:40.747
Al, I brought him
as soon as I heard!

45:40.785 --> 45:44.414
How many people do you think the people
he talked to have talked to by now?

45:44.455 --> 45:48.721
I guarantee at this minute my entire
fucking action downstairs is fucked up!

45:48.759 --> 45:52.160
Nobody's drinking, nobody's gambling,
nobody's chasing tail.

45:52.196 --> 45:54.460
I have to deal
with that!

45:58.302 --> 46:00.532
You want $10
or a bottle of dope?

46:00.571 --> 46:03.404
Bottle of dope please,
Mr. Swearengen.

46:03.441 --> 46:06.808
- Give him a bottle of dope.
- Come on, I'll take care of you.

46:10.548 --> 46:12.539
He's got a lot
on his mind, Johnny.

46:31.602 --> 46:34.264
Quiet! Al's got words!

46:38.242 --> 46:40.574
I guess when it starts
pissing rain in here,

46:40.611 --> 46:43.102
you know
who to blame, huh?

46:43.147 --> 46:45.377
I know word's circulating,

46:45.416 --> 46:48.146
Indians killed a family
on the Spearfish road.

46:48.185 --> 46:51.450
Now it's not for me to tell anyone
in this camp what to do,

46:51.489 --> 46:54.720
much as I don't want more people
getting their throats cut,

46:54.758 --> 46:57.693
their scalps lifted,
or any other godless thing

46:57.728 --> 47:00.856
that these godless
bloodthirsty heathens do-

47:00.898 --> 47:03.696
or even if someone wants
to ride out in darkest night,

47:03.734 --> 47:06.567
but I will
tell you this:

47:06.604 --> 47:09.698
I'd use tonight
to get myself organized,

47:09.740 --> 47:13.642
ride out in the morning,
clear-headed,

47:13.677 --> 47:15.941
and starting
tomorrow morning,

47:15.980 --> 47:19.381
I will offer
a personal $50 bounty

47:19.416 --> 47:21.407
for every decapitated head

47:21.452 --> 47:24.785
of as many of these
godless heathen cocksuckers

47:24.822 --> 47:27.950
as anyone can bring in,
tomorrow, with no upper limit!

47:29.026 --> 47:30.755
That's all I say
on that subject

47:30.794 --> 47:32.557
except next round's
on the house.

47:32.596 --> 47:36.464
And God rest the souls
of that poor family.

47:36.500 --> 47:37.933
Amen.

47:39.436 --> 47:42.132
And pussy's half-price
next 15 minutes.

47:51.649 --> 47:53.776
Okay, ladies,
let's go.

47:53.817 --> 47:57.753
She must have done some fancy fucking
to keep Al from killing her.

48:12.736 --> 48:15.068
Where's Bill Hickok?

48:15.105 --> 48:17.005
Where's Charlie Utter?

48:18.108 --> 48:19.439
Give me a drink!

48:23.747 --> 48:26.978
It's all right, Al, I know you got a lot
on your mind.

48:28.152 --> 48:30.211
That was one hell
of a good talk.

48:30.254 --> 48:32.882
Look, you got everybody
back at the tables,

48:32.923 --> 48:35.084
- doing what they do.
- Tell you the truth,

48:35.125 --> 48:38.754
for murdering people
on the road to Spearfish

48:38.796 --> 48:42.129
my money'd be on
Persimmon Phil.

48:42.166 --> 48:44.464
Make it look
like Indians.

48:44.501 --> 48:46.469
That is
his speciality.

48:48.539 --> 48:51.030
Is it true?

48:51.075 --> 48:53.202
Indians killing
white people?

48:53.244 --> 48:55.769
That's the sewer mouth
that follows Hickok around.

48:55.813 --> 48:57.144
Why are we
standing here?

48:57.181 --> 48:59.411
Riding out tomorrow,
daybreak.

48:59.450 --> 49:01.884
Oh, really?

49:01.919 --> 49:03.409
Tomorrow?

49:03.454 --> 49:05.547
What's your
fucking rush?!

49:06.724 --> 49:08.214
I'm going now.

49:09.593 --> 49:11.356
Even without Bill.

49:12.396 --> 49:14.091
Even without Charlie.

49:15.833 --> 49:18.529
I know the road
to Spearfish.

49:18.569 --> 49:21.629
And I don't drink where
I'm the only fucking one with balls!

49:28.345 --> 49:30.074
Let her go.

49:30.114 --> 49:32.173
She ain't taking
any business with her.

49:34.318 --> 49:36.309
And don't forget
to kill Tim.

49:56.073 --> 49:58.405
Yah.

50:21.332 --> 50:22.697
Wah! Yah!

53:18.876 --> 53:20.468
Get to your room.

53:20.511 --> 53:22.979
You should be sleeping
on a goddamn pew.

53:26.183 --> 53:27.912
You in love?

53:44.001 --> 53:46.299
Wake up, friend.
Come on now.

53:46.336 --> 53:49.305
You know I don't intrude
on the affairs of others.

53:51.108 --> 53:53.702
Problem enough keeping
my own life straight.

53:53.744 --> 53:58.181
When something's not my affair,
I don't pretend it is.

54:00.684 --> 54:03.209
Contrariwise,

54:03.253 --> 54:06.416
if you feeI like talking
about that headlight...

54:08.058 --> 54:10.151
I'll pay a dollar
a minute to hear you.

54:11.695 --> 54:14.220
Get anything off
your chest you feeI like.

54:15.832 --> 54:18.357
What I got on my chest

54:18.402 --> 54:20.233
don't concern you,
Ellsworth.

54:27.611 --> 54:31.877
And fuck us all anyway
for the limber-dick cocksuckers we are.

54:55.639 --> 54:58.665
- What is it?
- Just hush, Tim.

55:29.740 --> 55:31.173
Doc! Get up!

55:32.476 --> 55:35.868
Doc!

55:38.649 --> 55:41.140
Doc! Wake up!

55:42.552 --> 55:44.144
Doc!

55:48.592 --> 55:50.150
Oh God...

56:02.272 --> 56:05.332
Wait for me,
God damn it!

56:05.375 --> 56:07.070
Just hold on
till I'm with you.

56:10.681 --> 56:14.208
She don't mean nothing, Doc,
she's just excitable.

56:36.940 --> 56:40.068
What kinda hand is
your friend with a gun?

56:41.878 --> 56:44.108
I don't feeI
qualified to say.

56:48.485 --> 56:51.386
I guess I done my duty

56:51.421 --> 56:53.946
and I was glad enough
to help.

56:55.559 --> 56:56.958
Stick around,

56:56.993 --> 56:58.290
see if she lives.

56:58.328 --> 57:01.161
Nah, I was...

57:01.198 --> 57:04.167
glad enough to have done my duty
and that little one

57:04.201 --> 57:05.793
will be in my prayers.

57:06.970 --> 57:10.701
- Get down off your horse.
- Listen to me.

57:10.741 --> 57:13.574
I'm an innocent man,
it-

57:13.610 --> 57:15.737
it was them Indians,
God damn it!

57:15.779 --> 57:19.374
Too much ransacking,
and too many goods left behind.

57:19.416 --> 57:21.316
Someone was after money.

57:21.351 --> 57:23.945
God damn it, if I had something
to do with what happened,

57:23.987 --> 57:25.454
why'd I come
to this camp, huh?

57:25.489 --> 57:28.322
Maybe when it got
thick out there you ran.

57:29.426 --> 57:31.417
Maybe the others
was going to ground,

57:31.461 --> 57:34.123
but you had
to have pussy.

57:34.164 --> 57:35.722
And get
to a faro layout.

57:35.766 --> 57:38.963
I felt that way
sometimes after a kill.

57:39.002 --> 57:41.095
Get down off
your horse,

57:41.138 --> 57:43.800
or face
the consequences.

58:00.357 --> 58:02.621
Was that you or me,
Montana?

58:04.094 --> 58:06.961
My money'd
be on you.

59:25.242 --> 59:27.210
Yeah?
