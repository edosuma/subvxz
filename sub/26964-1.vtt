- Are you sitting down?

00:32.732 --> 00:34.166
Because I've got
  good news for you.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.667
- Uh huh.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.336
- The city council has
 approved your development.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.303
- Wow.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.605
- Yes, without any changes.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.140
- That's great.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.708
- The homeowner's association
 couldn't convince the judge

00:42.710 --> 00:44.877
that your new mixed-use
 facility would cause

00:44.879 --> 00:46.578
any negative impact at all.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.147
That's amazing.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.783
- So I need you
 to look at these contracts

00:50.785 --> 00:51.917
and get right back to me.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.452
- Will do.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.553
- Now, I'll be staying in
 the city for the holidays.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.055
- Uh huh.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.524
- So I'll be available any
 time to consult on this

00:58.526 --> 01:00.292
- Do you
 know that it's Christmas?

01:00.294 --> 01:03.495
- Yes, I know it's Christmas,
 but this is a very big deal,

01:03.497 --> 01:05.263
and I wanna make
  it happen for you.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.231
- Got it.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.666
- I will do whatever it takes.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.600
- Thank you.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.435
Merry Christmas to you.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.502
- You're welcome.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.771
Merry Christmas to you, too.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
- Making people's
 dreams come true again?

01:14.675 --> 01:15.974
- It's what I do.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.411
Karen.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.846
- Yeah.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.414
- I need to reschedule my
tomorrow with the seaport people

01:22.416 --> 01:24.383
from 10:30 to 11:30 if possible.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.217
- Okay.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.587
- And I also need you see
 if you can change that lunch

01:28.589 --> 01:31.356
with Ben Harrington and his
 attorney to drinks instead.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.025
Let's say 5:30.

01:33.027 --> 01:35.094
No, let's make it 5:15.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.962
I'll show up at 5:30 so
 they can worry a bit.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.232
- 10:30 to
 11:30, lunch to drinks,

01:40.234 --> 01:42.334
make 'em worry, got it.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.937
The famous Lucy
  Toomey power play.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.172
- I'm sure I have no idea
 what you're talking about.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.908
- Oh, wait.

01:49.910 --> 01:54.413
The courier dropped this
 at the front desk for you.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.547
- Yes!

01:55.549 --> 01:57.316
- What is it?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.384
- My tickets to the
 Nutcracker at Lincoln Center.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.019
- Oh, nice.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.821
Who's the lucky guy?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.890
- Actually it's my sister.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.992
Alice lives back
  where we grew up

02:06.994 --> 02:08.594
in Nilson's Bay, in Wisconsin.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.595
- Huh, let me guess.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.330
She's older, right?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.564
- How do you know that?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.700
- Ha, you totally have
 little sister syndrome.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.868
- What?

02:15.870 --> 02:17.369
- Luce, you're a
  complete overachiever.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.471
You knock yourself out on
 every single case you take.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.075
Alice must have been
  a tough act to follow.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.643
- Just because she
  got a full scholarship

02:24.645 --> 02:27.112
to veterinary college,
 and was first chair violin

02:27.114 --> 02:28.947
in school orchestra,
  and Homecoming Queen?

02:28.949 --> 02:32.017
- Oh, see what I mean?

02:32.019 --> 02:34.887
Hey, maybe we can hit up some
 clubs when she's in town.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.121
You know, show her
  how New Yorkers like

02:36.123 --> 02:37.389
to party at Christmas.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.024
- Oh, that's really
  sweet of you, Karen.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.594
Uh, the thing is, uh,
 Alice has some challenges.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.129
- Okay.

02:44.131 --> 02:47.199
- Uh, she was in a car accident
when she was in college,

02:47.201 --> 02:49.768
and she got a pretty
  bad head injury.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.538
- Lucy, I'm so sorry.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.438
I didn't know.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.607
- She does pretty well, though.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.442
And she loves the Nutcracker.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.444
She comes here to see it
 with me every Christmas.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.848
- Well, I can't
  wait to meet her.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.049
Oh my goodness.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.584
Okay, uh, the office
 party is in three hours,

03:05.586 --> 03:09.087
and I haven't done my hair,
 so, see see ya tonight?

03:09.089 --> 03:09.788
- Yeah.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.290
Okbye.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.635
- Hi, Alice, it's me.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.836
- Hi, Lucy.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.071
- I just
  booked your flight.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.406
- That's
  great, thank you.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.907
- I texted you all the details.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.710
I also emailed them to your
 office at the animal shelter.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.912
If you have any questions,
 you just call me, okay?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.347
- Okay.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.515
- I'm so glad
 you're coming to visit me.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.316
- I'm
  excited to see you.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.250
- I love you.

03:38.252 --> 03:38.784
- I love you too.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.585
Bye.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.272
- More champagne, please.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.042
That's good.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.311
Hi!

04:06.313 --> 04:08.413
Anne from accounting
 brought her brother again.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.915
He was asking about you.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.316
- No, no.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.353
- If you wanna let a perfectly
 good man go to waste,

04:14.355 --> 04:16.855
then I'll take him for you.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.328
- Having fun, Lucy?

04:23.330 --> 04:24.162
- Oh,

04:25.099 --> 04:27.766
Hi, Mr. Feeney, yes I am.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.268
It's a great party.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.403
- You had an amazing year,
 thanks to these people.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.371
And you.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.406
- Thank you, Mr. Feeney.

04:34.408 --> 04:39.378
- Could I speak with you
 for a moment, in private.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.212
- Sure.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.416
Junior partner?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.450
- Why not?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.685
You've certainly earned it.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.487
- I, I don't know what
  to say, Mr. Feeney.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.189
- Well, you can start
  by calling me Joe.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.624
- Thank you, Joe.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.961
- We'll talk later,
  but congratulations.

05:01.201 --> 05:05.037
- Alice, you are not gonna
 believe what just happened!

05:05.039 --> 05:09.708
Uncle Barney, what are you
 doing with Alice's phone?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.178
What?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.252
No, no.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.896
- Don't worry about a
thing here at the office, Lucy.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.431
If there's anything I can do,

05:32.433 --> 05:35.167
please don't hesitate to ask.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.902
- Thank you, Joe.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.904
- Take care, Lucy.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.268
- I'll help you.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.406
- Thanks, Alice.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.046
- What are sisters for?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.063
- Your sister's very good.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.398
Do you play?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.899
- Um, no, I don't.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.083
- Lucy!

08:40.020 --> 08:41.385
Where are you going?

08:41.388 --> 08:42.821
- To Peter's.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.222
I'm gonna help him
  decorate the tree.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.258
- Well we haven't
  had a chance to talk

08:46.260 --> 08:47.692
since I got home from school.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.528
- We can catch up tomorrow.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.297
Relax, we've got lots of time.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.999
- There's something I
 need to tell you, and I'm,

08:54.001 --> 08:57.168
- Alice, can't it
  wait until tomorrow?

08:58.338 --> 08:59.871
Besides, your audience
  wants another song.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.275
- You were great
  in there, Alice.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.442
You played beautiful.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.410
- Thank you, Peter.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.511
- Ready to go?

09:06.513 --> 09:07.712
- Yes.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.347
- Lucy!

09:09.349 --> 09:10.882
It's important.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.751
- All right, fine.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.786
Pick me up from Peter's at 10.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.955
And can talk then, okay?

09:16.957 --> 09:17.956
- Thank you.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.398
- Lucy?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.766
You here?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.870
- I'm here, Uncle Barney.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.243
- Hi, honey.

09:42.149 --> 09:42.981
I'm sorry.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.351
I'm so sorry.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.122
It was sudden.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.160
The doctor said there
  wasn't any pain.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.563
It was one of her heart valves.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.966
They didn't even
  know it was there.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.934
Said it could have
 ruptured at any moment.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.103
- I can't believe
  she's really gone.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.706
I just talked to her last week.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.108
She was fine.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.211
- Hasn't quite hit
  me yet, either.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.580
Seems like we were just
 putting up Christmas lights

10:15.582 --> 10:16.848
the other day.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.489
You know how she loved that.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.429
It's good to see you, Lucy.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.066
How long you planning to stay?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.535
- I have to leave right
 after the funeral.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.170
The day after tomorrow.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.138
- That soon?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.743
- You know, I wish
  I could stay longer.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.678
- We haven't seen you up here,

10:46.680 --> 10:50.448
well, since your folks
 died, 10 or 11 years ago.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.585
- I'm a corporate
  lawyer, Uncle Barney.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.221
You know my time isn't my own.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.155
- I get it.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.495
Time moves pretty
  fast these days.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.197
- Uncle Barney, thank
 you for doing all this.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.098
- Oh, baby.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.936
I haven't done everything.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.839
There's still Alice's estate
 you have to deal with.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.840
- Me?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.142
- Yeah, you're the next of kin.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.644
She probably left
  this place to you.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.080
I guess you've got
 some decisions to make.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.284
- Merry Christmas, Alice.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.360
- The kids were grown,
  and Harold was gone,

12:42.362 --> 12:44.829
and I was just all
  alone in that house.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.032
And then one day there's
 a knock at my door,

12:48.034 --> 12:52.103
and your sister is standing
 there with a kitten.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.773
Alice was always so
  good with animals.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.876
She was studying to be a
 veterinarian before her...

12:59.613 --> 13:00.845
before.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.113
- I am glad she ended up
 at the animal shelter,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.414
because I never I
  never even thought

13:03.416 --> 13:05.884
of having a cat, but
  it was like she knew

13:05.886 --> 13:08.153
what I needed before I did.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.623
I'll betcha half the people
 in this room would tell

13:11.625 --> 13:13.158
you the same thing.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.127
Your sister changed my life.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.962
- Thank you.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.373
I had no idea Alice
  knew so many people.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.576
- Your sister was a very
 big part of this town.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.845
When she started working
 for the animal shelter,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.747
she turned that place around.

13:35.749 --> 13:39.684
- And I don't remember them
 ever letting pets into church.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.186
- That was Alice, too.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.887
She thought it was unfair
 that people had to leave

13:42.889 --> 13:45.857
their pets home alone
  on Sunday mornings,

13:45.859 --> 13:47.492
so she put together a petition,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.495
and she went door to door,
 and got enough signatures

13:50.497 --> 13:52.564
to make City Hall
  change the bylaw.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.431
- She did that?

13:53.433 --> 13:54.265
- {Barney] Um hmm.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.433
- All by herself?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.702
- Well she had a little
 help from the FOA.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.970
- The FOA?

13:58.972 --> 13:59.838
- Lucy?

14:03.610 --> 14:04.609
- Hello, um.

14:10.016 --> 14:10.849
Oh, um.

14:12.419 --> 14:17.856
- Your sister was such a bright
light in all of our lives.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.429
Thank you, um.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.463
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.664
I'm Daphne.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.200
This is Celia and Rinda.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.704
I imagine that Alice
  told you about us.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.138
- Well, um.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.041
- We're the friends of Alice.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.142
- The FOA.

14:38.144 --> 14:38.977
- Yeah.
   - Yeah.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.511
- Um hmm.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.013
- We just wanted to let you
 know that if need anything,

14:42.015 --> 14:46.317
or if we can do anything,
 you can call us anytime.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.652
Really, anytime.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.822
- Thank you, all of you, um.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.892
It means a lot.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.027
- Your sister, she used
 to call us, day or night,

14:56.029 --> 14:57.996
whenever she needed anything.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.198
We were always there for her.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.766
- Well, like I said, thank you.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.469
I, I really appreciate...

15:19.819 --> 15:23.354
If you would excuse
  me please, um,

15:23.356 --> 15:26.190
I just need to get
  some fresh air.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.238
- Hello.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.641
Oh, hi, Mrs. Toomey.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.146
It's for you, Lucy.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.182
It's about your sister.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.584
- I was
  afraid you'd left.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.091
- Hi.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.860
- Hi.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.529
Lucy, I'm so sorry about Alice.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.964
She was such a wonderful woman,

16:39.966 --> 16:42.900
and I know she
  loved you very much.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.603
- Thank you.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.639
It's good to see you.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.474
- You too.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.882
It's a nice service.

16:59.753 --> 17:00.918
- Yes, it was.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.423
- If you get any time tomorrow,

17:05.425 --> 17:07.992
maybe we could go grab
 some coffee or something.

17:07.993 --> 17:10.627
- I can't, I'm leaving tomorrow.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.863
- Oh, you're not
  gonna stick around

17:11.865 --> 17:13.297
for the tree lighting
  ceremony next week?

17:13.299 --> 17:16.099
You know it was one of
 Alice's favorite events.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.669
- I can't, I'm sorry.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.172
I booked my flight for right
 after the lawyer comes by

17:21.174 --> 17:22.339
with the will.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.310
- Um, well actually,

17:28.615 --> 17:32.383
- It was good
  to see you, Peter.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.718
Goodbye.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.128
We are just waiting for
 the lawyer to show up.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.830
Of course he's late.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.533
I'll be on the 5:30
 flight out of Milwaukee,

17:48.535 --> 17:50.034
and I'll be in the
  office first thing

17:50.036 --> 17:51.869
in the morning, so reschedule
 that lunch with Harrington.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.405
Karen, I will call you
  back from the airport.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.339
Bye.

17:55.341 --> 17:56.074
- I'll see ya tonight.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.341
- Finally!

17:57.343 --> 17:58.676
- I guess you forgot the
 difference between real

17:58.678 --> 18:00.311
time and Nilson Bay time.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.113
- Yeah, well if this
  guy worked at my firm,

18:02.115 --> 18:03.848
he'd be fired in
  a New York minute.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.053
What are you doing here?

18:09.055 --> 18:11.923
- I tried to tell you yesterday.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.759
I'm handling your
  sister's estate.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.295
I'm Alice's lawyer.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.336
- This
  doesn't make sense.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.439
Why would Alice leave this
 place to the animal shelter

18:28.441 --> 18:29.974
instead of her own
  flesh and blood?

18:29.976 --> 18:33.244
- Well, that's not
  exactly what she did.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.012
She merely stipulated
  that Lucy has

18:35.014 --> 18:37.048
to fulfill certain
  requirements in order

18:37.050 --> 18:38.583
to inherit this property.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.717
- Like?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.619
- I have to stay here.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.654
I have to live in this house.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.956
For four weeks?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.224
- Exactly.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.725
Otherwise, ownership
  of the property will

18:47.727 --> 18:51.329
then be transferred to the
 Nilson's Bay Animal Rescue.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.598
- On the bright side, that
 takes you through New Year's.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.800
So you can spend Christmas here.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.034
- No I won't.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.603
- Why not?

18:58.605 --> 19:01.205
- Because I'm not
 staying here, that's why.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.474
There has got to be some
 loophole in this thing.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.209
- I'm afraid not.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.878
I drew it up myself.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.516
And Alice was very specific
 about what she wanted.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.851
- But why would she do this?

19:14.721 --> 19:17.021
She knew I lived in New York.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.056
Why would she want
  me to stay here?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.324
- Well you know Alice.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.659
She must have had her reasons.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.896
- And besides, it's
  only four weeks.

19:24.898 --> 19:29.333
- Peter, I can't just uproot
 my life for an entire month.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.735
I have a job.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.737
I have responsibilities.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.739
- Okay, well,

19:35.909 --> 19:37.608
I can draw up the
  de-transfer for you,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.377
and you can sign over the
 property before you go.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.444
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.313
Lucy, your
  grandparents built it.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.782
It's been in the
  family for decades.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.885
You sure you just
  wanna give it away?

19:53.760 --> 19:54.992
- A month?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.562
Oh, I didn't realize it
 would take that long.

19:57.564 --> 20:01.032
- I know, this is completely
 out of left field,

20:01.034 --> 20:03.501
but I can handle
  my cases from here.

20:03.503 --> 20:07.071
And I can be available for
 videoconferencing anytime

20:07.073 --> 20:08.306
day or night.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.908
- And what happens after
 this four weeks is up?

20:10.910 --> 20:15.279
- I take ownership of the
house and put it on the market.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.914
- You're going to sell it?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.382
- Absolutely.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.718
Trust me, Joe, I
  have no intention

20:20.720 --> 20:23.421
of moving back to Nilson's Bay.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.223
- Joy to da world.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.193
- Okay, well scan the
 signature pages and send

20:29.195 --> 20:32.363
them on to her, and
  CC me on everything.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.700
Yes, I am not coming
 back until the new year.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.534
- I remember you.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.342
- Lucy, did I lose you?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.876
Lucy?

20:45.878 --> 20:49.313
- Uh, listen, I'll call
 you back later if I think

20:49.315 --> 20:50.781
of anything, okay?

21:00.059 --> 21:02.059
- Which one
  do you wanna try?

21:02.061 --> 21:03.661
- That one.

21:03.663 --> 21:07.198
- Hello, girls, what
  can I getcha today?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.700
- Two gingerbread men, please.

21:10.903 --> 21:14.572
- Oh, 'fraid there's
  only one left.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.974
- We'll take it.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.808
- Okay.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.115
- Merry Christmas.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.850
- Merry Christmas.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.418
- Thank you.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.587
- You can have it.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.991
- Now we both can.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.437
- May I help you?

21:46.439 --> 21:47.772
- What?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.674
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.742
Just daydreaming, I guess.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.447
Hi, I met you the other day.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.917
You're one of Alice's friends.

21:59.919 --> 22:00.951
- Rinda.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.787
- Rinda, right.

22:02.789 --> 22:03.621
I'm Lucy.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.523
- I know.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.397
- I can't believe
 McHenry's still puts on

22:13.399 --> 22:15.833
the Taste of Christmas party.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.436
- Every year for the last 75.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.371
- It was always
 Alice's favorite night.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.440
- I'm surprised
  you remember that.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.978
- I just need to
  pick up a few things.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.049
- So you stickin'
  around for a while?

22:32.051 --> 22:36.520
- Yeah, just until after
 Christmas, actually.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.656
- And then
  back to New York?

22:38.658 --> 22:41.325
- Yeah, back to New York.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.333
Oh, it's Alice.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.369
- Yeah, she put out
  a can every Christmas

22:51.371 --> 22:54.705
to raise money for
  the animal shelter.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.874
Guess she never
  mentioned that to you.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.876
Or maybe you didn't ask.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.247
- Oh, she loved her
 animals, that's for sure.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.651
- I was very fond
  of your sister.

23:07.653 --> 23:08.552
We all were

23:09.722 --> 23:12.423
- Well Alice was a
  very special person.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.226
- I hope you appreciated
 having her in your life

23:15.228 --> 23:16.727
as much as we did.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.599
Well I have to get
  my recipes together

23:21.601 --> 23:23.334
for A Taste of Christmas.

23:23.336 --> 23:24.168
Excuse me.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.211
al music)

23:45.224 --> 23:47.224
- Excuse me,
  are you Miss Toomey?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.025
- Uh, yes.

23:50.363 --> 23:51.996
How can I help you girls?

23:51.998 --> 23:55.499
- Mom said to bring
  back Miss Alice's cat.

23:56.669 --> 24:00.237
- Well, I'm not staying.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.940
Merry Christmas.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.881
- Great, and now I have a cat.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.688
Okay, okay, I hear you.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
All right, okay, I know.

24:25.865 --> 24:26.697
Um, yeah.

24:29.902 --> 24:30.734
All right.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.904
Okay.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.740
Well, come on out, and let's
 get to know each other.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.012
Well it was nice
  to meet you too.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.682
Hello.

24:46.118 --> 24:46.951
Cat.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.553
Kitty.

24:52.091 --> 24:52.923
Kitty.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.359
Cat.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.094
Come on.

25:08.774 --> 25:09.607
- Hi.

25:10.443 --> 25:11.809
- Hi.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.944
- I, uh, got this for Alice.

25:13.946 --> 25:17.581
It was kind of a
  tradition with us.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.951
And I already have mine, so I
 thought maybe you'd like it.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.989
- Um, actually I wasn't
 planning on putting up a tree.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.157
- You do know that in Nilson's
 Bay it's a misdemeanor

25:27.159 --> 25:28.392
not to have a tree?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.194
I mean, you should see
  my office.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.830
I'm just tryin' to keep
 you out of trouble.

25:32.832 --> 25:33.864
Please don't make me
  take it all the way

25:33.866 --> 25:35.566
back home again, please.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.400
- Okay.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.501
- Okay, good.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.105
Okay, look out.

25:42.909 --> 25:43.741
Careful, careful!

25:43.743 --> 25:44.842
- All right, okay!

25:44.844 --> 25:45.976
- Watch yourself.
  - Okay.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.077
- Here we go.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.951
- It's a beautiful tree.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.520
- It has to be.

25:56.522 --> 26:00.424
Alice was very specific
 about her Christmas trees.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.693
- You guys really kept
 in touch all these years?

26:02.695 --> 26:06.030
- Sure, Alice was a
  really great friend.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.867
And in a way,

26:09.869 --> 26:11.168
she kind of, you know,

26:11.170 --> 26:12.002
kept me in touch with

26:12.004 --> 26:13.070
- Hey!

26:13.072 --> 26:14.038
- Oh, wait a second!
  - Okay.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.139
- Ah, I got it.

26:15.141 --> 26:15.973
- Okay.

26:17.410 --> 26:20.578
- I was sayin' that, in
 a way, it kind of kept me

26:20.580 --> 26:22.079
in touch with you too.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.314
- Me?

26:23.316 --> 26:25.583
- She talked about
  you a lot.

26:25.585 --> 26:29.153
And she told me about
  your life, your work,

26:29.155 --> 26:31.188
when you got your hair cut,
 what you had for lunch.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.924
- Sorry.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.125
- Hey, will you
  hold this for a sec?

26:35.127 --> 26:35.960
You got it?

26:35.962 --> 26:37.227
- Uh hmm.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.729
- I'll just
  take this stuff off.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.166
You know, she was my
  very first client.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.567
- Really?

26:43.569 --> 26:46.904
- Yeah, she paid me
  $100 and a goldfish.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.543
All right.

26:52.545 --> 26:53.711
I'm gonna pick this
  up, slide it in there.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.945
- Okay.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.381
- Just make sure
  it goes in there.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.383
- Got it.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.651
- Okay.

27:00.653 --> 27:04.188
Good, funny how we both
 became lawyers, huh?

27:04.190 --> 27:05.356
- Yeah, funny.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.226
Why did you do it?

27:09.228 --> 27:11.862
- Guess I always just wanted
 to fight for the little guy,

27:11.864 --> 27:14.431
you know, make sure
  justice was served.

27:14.433 --> 27:15.366
You?

27:15.368 --> 27:18.302
- Yeah, not exactly the same.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.006
I write contracts to help
 big property development

27:22.008 --> 27:25.142
companies acquire real
 estate and get even bigger.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.310
- You like it?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.312
- I'm good at it.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.313
- Objection.

27:31.684 --> 27:34.284
That's not really what I asked.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.920
- Sometimes I do.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.455
- And the other times?

27:38.457 --> 27:43.193
- I don't know anyone who's
 100% happy at their job.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.496
- I am.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.504
And that looks pretty good.

27:54.607 --> 27:56.807
- Do you know
  anything about cats?

27:56.809 --> 27:58.809
- I see you met Mr. Freckles.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.810
- Mr. Freckles.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.278
- That's his name.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.013
Daphne told me she was
 bringing him back to you.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.082
- Well I wish she had told him.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.184
He took off like a
 shot as soon as we came

28:07.186 --> 28:08.419
through the door.

28:08.421 --> 28:11.689
- I think I know
  where to find him.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.756
Meow!

28:17.430 --> 28:18.262
And voila.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.074
- Oh, there you are.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.510
- He always goes under here
 whenever there's a stranger

28:33.512 --> 28:34.878
in the house.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.413
- I'm not a stranger.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.815
I'm his Aunt Lucy.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.884
- Yeah, but he
  doesn't know that yet.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.289
- Mr. Freckles, here!

28:46.492 --> 28:50.928
I've got some delicious
 creamed liver surprise.

28:50.930 --> 28:51.862
Oh.

28:54.133 --> 28:54.965
Mow.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.468
- No, it's meorw.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.337
- Mow.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.740
- Work on it.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.776
- I can't believe I'm
 being rejected by a cat.

29:05.778 --> 29:10.214
- Ah, it may him awhile,
 but he'll come around.

29:10.216 --> 29:14.551
Remember, we're not the
 only ones who lost somebody.

29:16.021 --> 29:16.854
Ah, hey.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.128
Ah, they didn't finish it.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.062
- They?

29:25.064 --> 29:27.297
- Yeah, the friends of Alice.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.634
They were also sort of a
 quilting bee with your sister.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.237
- Um, do you know who Maeve is?

29:35.174 --> 29:36.240
- Hmm?

29:36.242 --> 29:37.908
- Here, "For Maeve."

29:38.944 --> 29:40.377
Who is that?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.879
- Ah, I can't say.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.215
- It must have been
 someone special to her.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.884
- Yeah, I'm sure they were,

29:46.886 --> 29:50.387
so, do want some help
  decorating the tree?

29:52.892 --> 29:53.857
- Right now?

29:53.859 --> 29:55.225
- Why not?

29:55.227 --> 29:56.894
Christmas is coming.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.107
- Peter, I found these upstairs.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.443
I can't believe she kept
 them all these years.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.379
- Excellent.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.847
And I found some music to put us

30:16.849 --> 30:18.949
in the tree decorating mood.
 ♪ Chestnuts roasting

30:24.023 --> 30:26.957
- Did you know it
  was Alice's, too?

30:28.761 --> 30:30.727
- I know Peter.

30:32.531 --> 30:35.899
I know that was her

30:35.901 --> 30:37.634
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.270
I didn't mean anything.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.973
It's just, you've
  been gone a while.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.277
- Alice understood.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.380
- I'm sure she did.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.150
- I helped her out a lot, okay,

30:53.152 --> 30:54.818
anything she needed.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.821
And when our
  parents passed away,

30:57.823 --> 31:00.791
I offered to bring
  her to the city,

31:00.793 --> 31:02.759
but she didn't wanna leave.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.628
- Why would she?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.763
This was her home,

31:06.765 --> 31:08.699
yours too, until she...

31:10.236 --> 31:15.105
It was an
  accident, Lucy.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.674
You know that, right?

31:17.676 --> 31:18.976
- Of course I do.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.378
- So what happened?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.314
We were so close, but you
 barely spoke to me after that.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.017
- I barely spoke to a
 lot of people after that.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.353
- Yeah, but you avoided
 me the entire last year

31:29.355 --> 31:30.687
of high school.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.589
And that was some trick,
 considering there were

 I gotta catch up

31:56.015 --> 31:58.849

32:14.566 --> 32:16.400

 all those decorations?

32:23.776 --> 32:25.008

Thank you, Alice.

  a wonderful lady.

You know, she's the reason
 why I got my first dog.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.566
- Really?

33:56.568 --> 33:58.035
- I met her at
  McHenry's one year,

33:58.037 --> 33:59.536
at the Taste of Christmas,
 and before I knew it,

33:59.538 --> 34:01.671
she'd talked me into
  a dachshund.

34:01.673 --> 34:02.873
Best thing that's
  ever happened to me.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.074
I got three of em now.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.542
- Oh.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.744
- So you told me on the
 phone that you were looking

34:07.746 --> 34:09.980
to sell Alice's house.

34:09.982 --> 34:12.516
- Yes, yes, Mr. Glaser,

34:12.518 --> 34:14.351
- Oh, please, Ed.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.918
May I call you Lucy?

34:15.920 --> 34:16.853
- Sure, Ed.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.190
My Uncle Barney recommended you

34:20.192 --> 34:22.726
as the best real
  estate agent in town.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.527
- Well, I'd certainly
  like to think so.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.696
And Nilson's Bay is
  a seller's market.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.465
We have several developers
 that are very interested

34:28.467 --> 34:30.667
in the area, and you
 have enough acreage there

34:30.668 --> 34:34.737
to put at least three
 decent sized pre-fab homes,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.473
maybe even a condo building.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.373
- Wait, um.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.878
You're saying they'd
 wanna tear down our house?

34:41.880 --> 34:44.947
- Well, Miss Toomey,
 it's lakefront property.

34:44.949 --> 34:48.485
One of the last parcels
 to be developed.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.420
- I hadn't really
  thought about that.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.922
- I understand,
  it's a cute house.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.157
But the comps in that area are

34:54.159 --> 34:55.859
in the half a
  million dollar range,

34:55.860 --> 34:57.194
and I'm certain we could
 get you at least that,

34:57.196 --> 34:59.429
maybe even a bit more.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.697
- I don't know.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.199
I'm not sure how I
  feel about having

35:02.201 --> 35:04.201
my family home torn down.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.269
- It's just a
  house, Miss Toomey.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.472
You could always buy
  another one.

35:08.474 --> 35:12.075
At these prices, you
 could probably buy two.

35:12.077 --> 35:15.479
- Well, uh, I have
  to think about it.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.581
Uh, thank you for your time, Ed.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.416
- I'd advise you not
  to think too long.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.485
It's like I always say, when
 opportunity comes callin,

35:21.487 --> 35:23.920
you better answer
  on the first knock.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.960
- Look at
  the tree, girls!

36:03.962 --> 36:06.329
- I like
  when it sparkles.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.597
- Yeah, me too.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.667
- Daphne, right?

36:10.669 --> 36:11.868
- Oh, hi!

36:11.870 --> 36:13.770
Yes, and these are my girls.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.072
This is Ophelia, and Portia.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.908
- The cat delivery service,

36:17.910 --> 36:18.942
right?
  - Yes.

36:18.944 --> 36:19.776
- Hi.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.244
- Hi, Miss Toomey.

36:21.246 --> 36:22.445
- Hi, Miss Toomey.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.181
- How are things goin
  with Mr. Freckles?

36:24.183 --> 36:26.917
- Actually, I don't think
 he likes me.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.585
- Oh, well he will.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.887
It just takes time.

36:30.889 --> 36:34.524
- Daphne, did you ever hear
 her mention the name Maeve?

36:34.526 --> 36:38.361
- Maeve, uh, no, not
 that I can remember, why?

36:39.565 --> 36:41.631
- I found a name tag
  on some quilt pieces

36:41.633 --> 36:42.899
she was working on.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.367
- Well I can tell you
  who those belong to.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.502
They're ours.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.670
- Yours?

36:46.672 --> 36:48.872
- Yeah, Alice, Celia,
  Rinda, and mine.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.608
We were making our annual
 Christmas friendship quilt,

36:51.610 --> 36:54.044
and we'd get together
 once a week to work on it.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.713
- You're welcome to come
 by and get it if you want.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.381
- The thing about a
  friendship quilt is

36:58.383 --> 37:00.383
you have to finish
  it in the same home

37:00.385 --> 37:01.418
that you started it in.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.221
It's kind of a tradition.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.555
- Oh.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.157
- Well, you don't
  mind if we finish

37:07.159 --> 37:09.125
it in your house, do you?

37:09.127 --> 37:10.393
- Oh.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.661
- It won't take long,
  maybe a couple hours,

37:11.663 --> 37:13.830
and we won't make
  a mess, I promise.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.966
- I actually have a
  lot of work to do.

37:15.968 --> 37:19.169
- So Thursday in the
 afternoon, say, five-ish?

37:19.171 --> 37:20.070
I'll bring the cookies.

37:20.072 --> 37:20.904
- This Thursday?

37:20.906 --> 37:21.905
- Okay, great.

37:21.907 --> 37:22.739
Well, we'll see you then.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.673
- Bye.
    - Bye.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.941
- Bye.
   - Oh, bye!

37:36.054 --> 37:37.721
- Uh, huh.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.422
Yeah, right.

37:39.424 --> 37:42.892
Well, that would be unfortunate.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.761
I will tell him.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.595
Bye, bye.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.599
Lucy, hi, you're still in town.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.468
- Still here.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.870
I'm looking for Peter Swinson.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.307
- I take it you don't know Mr.
 Swinson real well.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.241
- Why do you say that?

37:58.243 --> 37:59.943
It's 12:30 on a Wednesday.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.812
There's really only one
 place you're gonna find him.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.162
- Hi.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.064
- What are you doin' here?

38:21.066 --> 38:23.066
- I, I need some advice.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.936
- Personal or professional?

38:26.938 --> 38:29.472
- A bit of both, I guess.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.809
- Okay, but it'll
  have to be on the ice.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.910
- What?

38:33.912 --> 38:35.445
- I'm in the middle of class.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.013
- Come on, Mr. Swinson!

38:37.015 --> 38:38.848
- Give me a second!

38:38.850 --> 38:39.683
Well?

38:41.620 --> 38:42.952
Whatta you say?

38:42.954 --> 38:46.156
- It's been a long time
 since I was on skates.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.758
- They say you never
  forget how to do it.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.261
It's like riding a bike.

38:51.263 --> 38:53.630
- It's been a long time
 since I rode a bike, too.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.565
- I won't let you fall.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.170
- Sounds like Ed can
  get you a lot of money

39:00.172 --> 39:01.905
of the property, but...

39:01.907 --> 39:03.340
- But?

39:03.342 --> 39:05.809
- Well I mean, the Toomeys
 have had that house

39:05.811 --> 39:07.544
since before I was born.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.613
You sure you're ready
  to say goodbye to it?

39:10.615 --> 39:13.183
- I guess I'll have to be.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.485
You can't hold on to the past.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.788
- Whoa, comin
  through, Mr. Swinson.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.623
- How long have you
  been doing this?

39:20.625 --> 39:22.225
- Oh, couple years.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.295
Alice was a volunteer
 at the community center,

39:25.297 --> 39:28.498
and she drafted me to teach
 the kids how to skate.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.866
- I'm starting to think
 there wasn't anything

39:29.868 --> 39:31.801
in this town she
  wasn't involved in.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.670
- Yeah, she
 definitely made a difference

39:33.672 --> 39:35.004
in Nilson's Bay.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.608
- Do you think that's why
 she wanted me to be here

39:38.610 --> 39:40.243
for the month?

39:40.245 --> 39:41.745
- What do you mean?

39:41.747 --> 39:45.482
- Maybe she wanted me to
 see how important she was?

39:45.484 --> 39:50.220
- Or maybe she wanted you
 to slow down for a minute.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.921
Stop running from things.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.090
- I'm not running from anything.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.558
- Sure you are.

39:55.560 --> 40:00.163
You ran away from this town,
 away from these people,

40:00.165 --> 40:01.231
away from us.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.534
- Woo, Mr. Swinson.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.237
- All right, that's it.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.239
Guys, that's it for today.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.673
Everybody off the ice.

40:10.675 --> 40:11.808
Hot cocoa's on me.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.977
- Yes!

40:17.182 --> 40:19.482
- I'm not running
  from anything, Peter.

40:19.484 --> 40:23.186
I just don't wanna
  live in the past.

40:23.188 --> 40:26.089
- You may not be living
 in the past, Lucy,

40:26.091 --> 40:29.959
but I think the past is
 still kinda living in you.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.807
- I've arranged
  for an extension

40:43.809 --> 40:45.074
on the Harrington case.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.811
- Joe, you didn't
  have to do that.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.513
I've been keeping up with
 things from this end, and,

40:50.515 --> 40:53.283
- I understand, but the client
 needs a face-to-face meeting

40:53.285 --> 40:56.052
before he'll proceed,
 so you're due back here,

40:56.054 --> 40:58.388
on, what is it now, three weeks?

40:58.390 --> 40:59.823
- Uh, huh.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.124
- You know, we could
 challenge your sister's

41:01.126 --> 41:02.625
will in court.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.494
I still don't understand
 why she needed you to stay

41:04.496 --> 41:06.229
in the house this long.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.997
- Uh, I'm not sure either.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.136
Wow.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.271
Uh, I'm going to have
  to call you back.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.940
I'll call you later.

41:18.343 --> 41:19.175
- Goodbye.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.313
- There you are.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.283
So now you wanna play?

41:34.359 --> 41:35.325
I guess not.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.743
What are these, Alice?

41:56.348 --> 41:57.614
Self portraits?

42:13.164 --> 42:16.165
- Hi, I brought
  the cookies, whoo.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.667
- I didn't think we were
 gonna make it up that hill.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.135
- I mean, Rinda, if you
 would just put the chains

42:19.137 --> 42:20.303
on those tires.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.538
- My tires are perfectly fine.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.472
- Oooh.

42:22.474 --> 42:23.406
- It's the ice on the roads.

42:23.408 --> 42:24.807
They don't use enough salt.

42:24.809 --> 42:26.042
- They can't use that much salt.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.377
It's bad for the deer.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.711
- Oh, so because of the deer,

42:28.713 --> 42:29.812
you have to drive off the road.

42:29.814 --> 42:31.748
- That's why you
  need the chains.

42:31.750 --> 42:32.916
- I like deer.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.654
- Wow, it's Thursday already?

42:44.329 --> 42:46.162
- How are we gonna do this?

42:46.164 --> 42:48.565
- We just pick up where
 we left off, don't we?

42:48.567 --> 42:50.867
- She means how are we
 gonna do this without Alice.

42:50.869 --> 42:53.536
- It just doesn't feel right,

42:53.538 --> 42:56.039
making a quilt without her.

42:56.041 --> 42:59.142
- Okay, I hope you
  all like Earl Grey.

42:59.144 --> 43:01.477
It's the only thing I
 could find in the cupboard.

43:01.479 --> 43:04.180
And, Daphne, I
  couldn't help myself.

43:04.182 --> 43:06.549
I snuck one of those
  Christmas cookies,

43:06.551 --> 43:07.984
and they are umm.

43:12.424 --> 43:16.025
- Lucy, have you
  ever quilted before?

43:16.027 --> 43:16.859
- Me?

43:18.330 --> 43:20.496
Oh, I, I can't sew
  a button on a shirt.

43:20.498 --> 43:21.831
- Oh, we've always
  had four people

43:21.833 --> 43:23.633
in our quilting group, Lucy.

43:23.635 --> 43:25.835
With Alice gone, it
  just, it feels...

43:25.837 --> 43:27.403
- It feels like
  someone's missing.

43:27.405 --> 43:28.972
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

43:28.974 --> 43:31.574
- It would mean a lot
  if you would help us.

43:31.576 --> 43:33.076
- I am sorry.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.678
I would really love to help,
 but I don't know anything

43:35.680 --> 43:36.913
about making a quilt.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.448
- Oh, Rinda taught
  me in like an hour.

43:38.450 --> 43:39.282
- I mean, yeah.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.950
- It's no problem, Lucy.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.018
Don't worry about it.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.220
We'll be okay on our own.

43:44.222 --> 43:47.023
I mean, no one is gonna
 judge you, just because

43:47.025 --> 43:49.959
you don't wanna help us
 finish this very special quilt

43:49.961 --> 43:51.894
that Alice helped make.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.202
- Hand me a needle.

44:03.008 --> 44:05.408
- You're probably gonna
 be really good at this.

44:51.890 --> 44:55.291
- I was having a hard
  time financially,

44:55.293 --> 44:58.294
so I went to McHenry's to see
 if they had a job opening.

44:58.296 --> 44:59.562
And there wasn't.

44:59.564 --> 45:02.665
But Alice was there, and
 she overheard my story.

45:02.667 --> 45:05.134
She moved me into
  the guest room here

45:05.136 --> 45:06.402
that same night.

45:06.404 --> 45:07.704
- Wait, you lived here?

45:07.706 --> 45:09.572
- Yeah, for three months.

45:09.574 --> 45:12.108
- I think everybody in
 town's got a story like that.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.944
You know when my husband,
 Earl, was driving trucks,

45:14.946 --> 45:16.779
I'd be alone for
  weeks at a time.

45:16.781 --> 45:21.050
And Alice noticed me sitting
 by myself at Sunday service.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.955
And she just started
 sittin' with me.

45:25.957 --> 45:27.790
She didn't really give me
 much choice in the matter.

45:29.094 --> 45:30.259
- That sounds like Alice.

45:32.197 --> 45:34.864
- Oh, well there you are.

45:34.866 --> 45:37.233
- How do you do that?

45:37.235 --> 45:39.502
He runs away every
  time I try to pet him.

45:39.504 --> 45:41.838
- Don't worry.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.439
He'll warm up to you.

45:43.441 --> 45:44.507
It's just like I
  said the other day.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.542
It's gonna take time.

45:49.748 --> 45:51.681
I think he still misses Alice.

45:51.683 --> 45:54.350
- What was she like, Lucy?

45:54.352 --> 45:56.385
We all knew her
  after the accident.

45:56.387 --> 46:00.123
It's just, she never, she
 never talked about that day.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.791
- Um, she was funny.

46:06.264 --> 46:10.767
And kind, I mean she'd just
 about do anything for you.

46:12.504 --> 46:14.504
- I guess in a lot of
 ways that really matter

46:14.506 --> 46:15.905
she was the same.

46:17.175 --> 46:21.177
- Maybe, but before the
 accident, everything was

46:26.384 --> 46:28.384
so effortless for Alice.

46:29.554 --> 46:33.089
I think that was
  the hardest part,

46:33.091 --> 46:35.892
watching her
  struggle with things

46:35.894 --> 46:37.627
like buttoning a shirt,

46:37.629 --> 46:41.631
or playing her violin.

46:44.569 --> 46:46.936
I, I, I think I'm
  done for tonight.

46:46.938 --> 46:50.706
- Yeah, yeah we can, we'll
 pick this up another day.

46:50.708 --> 46:52.708
- Oh, it's okay, I'm not tired.

46:52.710 --> 46:53.943
- Oh.

46:53.945 --> 46:57.213
- Oh, wow, yeah,
  look at the time.

46:57.215 --> 46:58.047
- You should go.
  - You should go.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.552
- Will you call us
  if you need anything?

47:02.554 --> 47:04.453
- Thanks for having us.

47:06.024 --> 47:07.290
Pretty soon we're gonna
 have to make a quilt

47:07.292 --> 47:09.692
for the baby, yeah.

47:11.963 --> 47:12.795
Thank you.

47:14.632 --> 47:15.898
- Oh, don't forget
  to hide those squares

47:15.900 --> 47:17.099
from Mr. Freckles.

47:17.101 --> 47:18.935
I saw him eyeing
  them all night long.

47:18.937 --> 47:20.436
- I will, promise.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.171
- Good night.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.840
- Good night.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.843
Thank you for tonight.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.779
I guess I really needed this.

47:29.781 --> 47:32.582
- We had a lotta nights
 like this with Alice.

47:32.584 --> 47:34.116
A lotta fun.

47:34.118 --> 47:37.119
She always said she wished
 you could have been here.

47:37.121 --> 47:37.954
Bye, Lucy.

47:40.892 --> 47:42.458
- Goodnight.

48:40.084 --> 48:45.087
- I knew Alice took art
classes as part of her therapy,

48:45.223 --> 48:47.890
but I didn't know she
  was this artistic.

48:47.892 --> 48:49.492
Who do you think this is?

48:49.494 --> 48:51.360
- Well, they're all self
 portraits, aren't they?

48:51.362 --> 48:53.195
- I don't think so.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.932
The hair's different, and
 there's something in the eyes.

48:55.934 --> 48:56.866
- Uncle Barney,

48:56.868 --> 48:57.700
- Yeah.

48:58.770 --> 49:01.137
- Do you know
  somebody named Maeve?

49:01.139 --> 49:03.239
- Maeve, Maeve, no.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.273
Can't say that I do.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.408
Why?

49:05.410 --> 49:07.877
- I found some beautiful
 Christmas quilts

49:07.879 --> 49:10.212
in a trunk upstairs.

49:10.214 --> 49:12.615
And they all have a
 tag with the name Maeve

49:12.617 --> 49:14.083
embroidered on them.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.685
I thought maybe Alice had
 made them for somebody

49:15.687 --> 49:16.686
in the family?

49:16.688 --> 49:18.220
- Name doesn't ring a bell.

49:18.222 --> 49:22.725
But like I told you, a
 lot of people knew Alice.

49:22.727 --> 49:25.061
What are your plans
  for Christmas?

49:25.063 --> 49:26.662
- Actually, I wasn't
  gonna make any.

49:26.664 --> 49:29.498
I thought I'd just stay
 in and get some work done.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.600
- Well that's ridiculous.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.836
Whatta you say, I'll put
 together a little dinner

49:33.838 --> 49:34.737
for the both of us?

49:34.739 --> 49:35.638
Which would you like?

49:35.640 --> 49:36.973
Ham or Turkey?

49:36.975 --> 49:37.907
- No, really.

49:37.909 --> 49:41.277
- I'll put in an order for both.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.979
That's a nice tree.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.547
Where'd it come from?

49:44.549 --> 49:46.382
- Peter Swinson
  bought it for Alice?

49:46.384 --> 49:49.151
- Well, now, I haven't
 heard you say that name

49:49.153 --> 49:50.386
in a long time.

49:52.223 --> 49:57.226
Whatta you say we invite him
 over for Christmas dinner?

49:58.696 --> 50:00.162
It's be nice to see you two
 getting back together again.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.933
- We're not getting back
 together again, Uncle Barney.

50:03.935 --> 50:06.268
He just helped with the tree.

50:06.270 --> 50:08.337
- Okay, whatever you say.

50:11.442 --> 50:14.043
You know he was Alice's lawyer.

50:15.179 --> 50:17.113
Did you ask him about
  this Maeve person?

50:17.115 --> 50:19.482
- He said he didn't
 know anything about it.

50:19.484 --> 50:20.783
- It's a small town.

50:20.785 --> 50:23.386
Maybe he can help you find her.

50:26.457 --> 50:28.524
- Mr. Swinson is not in
 the office right now,

50:28.526 --> 50:29.959
may I take a message?

50:29.961 --> 50:32.028
- Hi, Carla, it's Lucy Toomey.

50:32.030 --> 50:34.530
I tried him on his cell,
 but I couldn't reach him.

50:34.532 --> 50:38.968
- Hi, Lucy, yeah, yeah, that's
 because he's on the ice.

50:38.970 --> 50:40.836
- Oh, he's at the rink?

50:40.838 --> 50:43.439
- Oh, no, not that ice.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.840
The blue ice.

50:44.842 --> 50:45.875
He's fishin'.

50:49.847 --> 50:53.015
Now you cannot miss
  Mr. Swinson's hut.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.919
Look for all the Christmas.

51:26.451 --> 51:27.249
- Peter!

51:32.056 --> 51:34.557
- Lucy, what are you doin' here?

51:34.559 --> 51:35.591
- You know I was
 in the neighborhood,

51:35.593 --> 51:36.625
so I thought I'd stop by.

51:37.462 --> 51:38.727
- What?

51:38.729 --> 51:39.562
- It's cold.

51:39.564 --> 51:40.796
- Hey, hey.

51:40.798 --> 51:44.233
- Oh, I love what you've
 done with the place.

51:44.235 --> 51:45.067
- Thanks.

51:45.069 --> 51:46.402
Be careful there.

51:46.404 --> 51:47.236
- Oh.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.370
- Sorry for the mess.

51:48.372 --> 51:49.672
I don't get any guests.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.273
I think yoghbe the first.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.274
Have a seat.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.412
- Thanks

51:57.582 --> 51:58.581
How's the fishing?

51:58.583 --> 51:59.515
- Don't ask.

51:59.517 --> 52:01.250
I've changed the lures twice.

52:01.252 --> 52:02.751
But I think they're on to me.

52:02.753 --> 52:06.555
May I offer you a specialty
 of the house, hot apple cider?

52:06.557 --> 52:08.057
- Yes, I would like that.

52:08.059 --> 52:09.325
Thank you.

52:09.327 --> 52:12.828
- So what brings you
  all the way out here?

52:12.830 --> 52:14.830
- You remember that quilt
 with the name Maeve on it?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.166
- Uh, huh.

52:17.168 --> 52:19.602
- I found a trunk-full
  in Alice's room,

52:19.604 --> 52:21.604
all with the same
  name on the tags.

52:21.606 --> 52:24.673
Are you sure Alice
  didn't mention her?

52:24.675 --> 52:27.443
- Not that I can tell you.

52:27.445 --> 52:31.547
- Well I've been looking
 for her on the internet,

52:33.251 --> 52:34.783
but I haven't found anything.

52:34.785 --> 52:36.452
I thought maybe
  you could help me.

52:36.454 --> 52:37.386
Ask around?

52:38.356 --> 52:40.289
Check out the town records?

52:40.291 --> 52:41.891
- Yeah, without a last
  name, I'm not sure

52:41.893 --> 52:43.259
how far we'd get.

52:45.897 --> 52:49.732
Sounds like it's really
 important to you, isn't it?

52:49.734 --> 52:51.834
- In a way, yes.

52:51.836 --> 52:55.437
I feel like I wanna do
  something for Alice.

52:55.439 --> 52:59.308
- You came here for Christmas,
 maybe that's enough.

53:00.378 --> 53:01.377
Oh, yes!
  - You got something!

53:01.379 --> 53:02.378
- Ha!

53:02.380 --> 53:03.612
Gimme the net!
   - Okay, okay.

53:03.614 --> 53:04.647
- It's right
  there up on the wall.

53:04.649 --> 53:05.481
- Where, where?

53:05.483 --> 53:06.415
- On the wall!

53:06.417 --> 53:07.650
Hurry up, bring it over here!

53:07.652 --> 53:08.184
- Don't yell at me!
  - I'm not yelling!

53:08.186 --> 53:09.051
- Wait!

53:09.053 --> 53:09.818
Here!

53:13.958 --> 53:15.424
So much for dinner.

53:15.426 --> 53:17.493
- Well, that's all right.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.299
I got a better idea.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.514
That looks good.

53:38.516 --> 53:42.051
- Are you sure kringles
 qualify as dinner?

53:42.053 --> 53:45.287
- Only in Wisconsin, and
 only in Christmas time.

53:46.157 --> 53:46.989
- Mmmm.

53:48.259 --> 53:51.660
- So, do you like
  living in New York?

53:53.764 --> 53:57.366
- Like might not
  quite be the word.

53:57.368 --> 53:58.267
It's crazy.

53:59.203 --> 54:01.870
It's fast-paced,
  exciting, scary.

54:04.809 --> 54:05.908
- Sounds fun.

54:11.382 --> 54:12.548
- Seeing anyone?

54:12.550 --> 54:15.618
- No, not really.

54:17.188 --> 54:19.154
Work keeps me pretty busy.

54:19.156 --> 54:20.656
- Oh.

54:20.658 --> 54:24.059
- Seems like there's never
 enough time.

54:24.061 --> 54:25.561
How 'bout you?

54:25.563 --> 54:29.932
- Me? Ah, well, you know the
 Nilson's Bay social scene.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.734
It's been non-stop.

54:33.571 --> 54:36.605
I went out with Tanya
 Beaumont a couple years ago.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.506
- Tanya from trig?

54:37.508 --> 54:38.374
- Um hmm.

54:38.376 --> 54:39.808
- The one with the hair?

54:39.810 --> 54:41.043
How did that go?

54:41.045 --> 54:41.877
- She's married
  now with two kids.

54:41.879 --> 54:42.711
- Oh.

54:43.547 --> 54:44.413
I'm sorry.

54:44.415 --> 54:45.614
- That's okay.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.017
It was never gonna work anyway.

54:48.019 --> 54:51.153
I guess I've always just
 had this picture in my head

54:51.155 --> 54:53.756
of my perfect match, you know.

54:53.758 --> 54:56.759
No one's ever been able
 to live up to that.

54:56.761 --> 54:59.695
- What does this
  picture look like?

55:01.732 --> 55:02.665
- Like you.

55:08.572 --> 55:09.705
- Peter.

55:09.707 --> 55:11.173
- I thought I'd
 forgotten how this felt,

55:11.175 --> 55:13.108
and then you showed up.

55:17.882 --> 55:19.648
And it all came back.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.054
- Good evening, everybody!

55:25.056 --> 55:28.957
Welcome to the Nilson's Bay
 annual tree lighting ceremony.

55:31.462 --> 55:35.664
Without any further ado,
 let's start the count down.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.799
- Five!

55:36.801 --> 55:37.700

55:37.702 --> 55:38.634

55:38.636 --> 55:39.702

 kringle didn't fill you up?

56:24.348 --> 56:25.581
- Ah, thanks, Rinda.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.549
- Hey, all set for the
  Taste of Christmas?

56:27.551 --> 56:28.851
- I guess I better be,
  since it's the last

56:28.853 --> 56:30.285
one we're every gonna have.

56:31.122 --> 56:32.588
- Whatta you mean?

56:32.590 --> 56:33.822
- Ed Glaser convinced
 McHenry to sell this place

56:33.824 --> 56:34.790
to a developer.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.624
- What?

56:36.794 --> 56:38.794
- They're closin
  after New Year's.

56:38.796 --> 56:40.396
Word is they're gonna
  tear the place down

56:40.398 --> 56:42.231
and turn it into
  a bunch of condos

56:42.233 --> 56:44.299
and a frozen yogurt shop.

56:45.436 --> 56:48.537
No more McHenry's,
  and I'm out of a job.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.074
Nice merry Christmas.

57:01.986 --> 57:03.452
- Been hearing rumblings

57:03.454 --> 57:05.654
that Mr. McHenry's been
 trying to sell for a while.

57:05.656 --> 57:09.324
- But McHenry's is a part of
the fabric of this town, Peter.

57:09.326 --> 57:12.261
We can't just let
  them tear it down.

57:12.263 --> 57:14.163
- You're pretty
  fired up about this.

57:14.165 --> 57:17.800
- Well, it means a
  lot to people here.

57:17.802 --> 57:19.301
When we were kids,

57:23.040 --> 57:25.541
it meant a lot to Alice and me.

57:25.543 --> 57:28.277
- Wait, aren't you
  the one who told me

57:28.279 --> 57:31.280
that we can't live in the past?

57:31.282 --> 57:34.616
- That's why we have
  to save McHenry's.

57:34.618 --> 57:38.587
We can't let it become
 part of the past, Peter.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.589
We have to do something.

57:44.094 --> 57:45.160
- Okay, then.

57:53.237 --> 57:55.270
- Nah, I haven't even started
 my Christmas shopping yet.

57:55.272 --> 57:57.272
I'm thinking gift cards.

57:57.274 --> 58:00.175
Harry, let me give
  you a call back.

58:01.679 --> 58:03.212
Lucy, hello!

58:03.214 --> 58:04.847
Let me guess, you've
  made your decision?

58:04.849 --> 58:07.382
- Yes, I've made my decision.

58:07.384 --> 58:09.518
You're not getting our house.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.752
- What?

58:10.754 --> 58:14.690
- In fact, nobody is,
 because I'm not selling.

58:14.692 --> 58:17.392
And as for McHenry's,
  I'm gonna do whatever

58:17.394 --> 58:21.163
I can to stop them
  from selling, too.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.131
- Well you're a
  bit late with that.

58:23.133 --> 58:24.633
We closed escrow this morning,

58:24.635 --> 58:26.101
and the development
 company's already taking

58:26.103 --> 58:27.703
bids on demolition.

58:29.106 --> 58:33.342
- Well, you better tell
 them they're in for a fight.

58:47.658 --> 58:49.992
- Rinda, these are amazing.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.327
- So good.

58:52.329 --> 58:54.196
- I figure, if this is
  the end of McHenry's,

58:54.198 --> 58:55.664
might as well out in style.

58:55.666 --> 58:58.100
- It doesn't have to be the end.

58:58.102 --> 58:59.601
I wanna help.

58:59.603 --> 59:01.670
McHenry's is more than a store.

59:01.672 --> 59:03.772
This is a Christmas tradition,

59:03.774 --> 59:06.008
one that means something
 to a lot of people

59:06.010 --> 59:07.276
in this town.

59:07.278 --> 59:10.746
I think we owe it to
  then, to ourselves,

59:10.748 --> 59:12.414
to keep that tradition alive.

59:12.416 --> 59:13.949
- Do you think we can
  stop them from tearin

59:13.951 --> 59:15.784
this place down?

59:15.786 --> 59:17.352
- I know we should try.

59:18.188 --> 59:19.021
- Yes.

59:19.023 --> 59:19.855
- Yes.

59:19.857 --> 59:21.657
Yes, we should.

59:21.659 --> 59:24.560
- Step one, we're going
 to start a petition.

59:24.562 --> 59:26.428
We need to get as many
  signatures as we can,

59:26.430 --> 59:28.597
show them the town
  is behind our cause.

59:28.599 --> 59:29.965
- That shouldn't be hard.

59:29.967 --> 59:31.600
I mean, everyone
  loves McHenry's.

59:31.602 --> 59:33.669
- Daphne, you write a
 letter to the local paper.

59:33.671 --> 59:35.337
I'll start a page
  on the town website.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.406
And, Celia, you're in
  charge of research.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.207
We need some
 statistics on our side.

59:39.209 --> 59:40.042
- Got it.

59:41.312 --> 59:43.245
Wha, what kind of statistics?

59:43.247 --> 59:46.548
- The developer'll say that
 it'll increase the tax base.

59:46.550 --> 59:48.383
We need some
  evidence to show that

59:48.385 --> 59:50.185
it will have negative
 impact on the community

59:50.187 --> 59:51.119
as a whole.

59:52.423 --> 59:55.190
Look for comparable situations
 in other small towns

59:55.192 --> 59:56.892
across the state.

59:56.894 --> 59:57.793
- Got it.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.528
- Oh, look who it is.

01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:02.030
- Well it's about time.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.734
- So how do you
  know all this stuff?

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:09.204
- Well actually it's
 what I do for a living.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:10.706
Just on the other side.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:14.009
At my law firm, we help
 clients buy up properties

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:16.311
in small towns and
  redevelop them.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.413
But sometimes the
 communities fight back.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:20.816
- That's what we're
  gonna do, fight back!

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:23.385
- But we need to build
 awareness in town about this.

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:25.187
It has to be a community effort.

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:26.421
- Why?

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:28.957
- Because it only works
 if it's their cause.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.959
Whadda ya think?

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.829
- I think it's time
  to get to work.

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:53.809
- Thanks.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.645
Well you know my
  family and tradition.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:58.346
Why don't you bring your
 Uncle Barney with you.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.248
- Okay, we'll be there.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.818
- Great, come around six.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.588
Oh and, Lucy, you know
  what you have to wear.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:08.690
- Oh, no.

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:09.858
Please.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.493
Look, I didn't
  bring one of those.

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:12.828
- Just check the closet.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.930
Alice has a whole collection.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.164
See ya tonight.

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:19.568
- Thank you.

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.539
- Okay, Mr. Swinson.

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:26.708
I am going going to lunch.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:30.245
Mr. Swinson, is everything okay?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.852
- I don't know, Carla.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:42.557
- You sure everybody's
  wearing these?

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:43.692
- They'd better be.

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:45.794
- Oh, my Christmas!

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:46.661
Look who's here!

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:47.963
- Mrs. Swinson.

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.499
- Hey, Sweetie, I'm so
 glad you could make it.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.901
We've missed you around here.

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:53.869
Hello, Barney.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:55.504
- Mrs. Swinson.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.372
- Welcome to Cookiemas.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.476
- What's a Cookiemas?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:02.377
- You'll see.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.350
- I see.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.818
- One bow,
 and that's all, that's it.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.752
- Incoming!

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.288
This is hot.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.456
Ready for another batch.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.390
- We got another
  batch right here, Dad.

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:16.324
- All right.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.192
Let's keep these cookies coming.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.727
- Yes, sir.

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:22.464
- Uncle Barney, I think
 you know everybody here.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.833
Everybody, Uncle Barney,

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.835
- Hey, hey.
  - And his niece Lucy.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.804
Lucy's from Nilson's Bay,

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.772
but right now she's
  a big-time lawyer

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:32.941
in New York City.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.109
- Uh, not that big.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.710
- That's not what Peter says.

01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:38.947
He said you're making
 waves in Nilson's Bay, too.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:40.982
What is this about a
  petition going around?

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.250
- Lucy's trying
  to save McHenry's

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:43.084
from the wrecking ball.

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:44.319
- Oh, really?

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.754
Is there anything
  I could do to help?

01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:46.988
- Actually, yes there is.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.658
- Oh, girl, look at
 you makin a difference.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.060
Your sister would
  be so proud of you.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.262
And having you here tonight
 is like having a piece

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:55.931
of her with us also.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.167
- Thank you, Mrs. Swinson.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.536
That's just about the
  nicest thing anyone's

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.038
ever said to me.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.774
- Now just what do you do
 with all these cookies?

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:08.577
- We take them down to
  the retirement home,

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:11.446
just something to
 brighten up their holiday.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.049
- And all the grandkids,
 they visit on cookie day.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.885
But this year, we need
  a new Santa Claus.

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.254
Would you be up for it?

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:21.289
- I think after a few
 of these snickerdoodles,

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.224
I just might be.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.892
- Good, good.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:24.893
- Hey!

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.729
- Hey.
  - I see you found one.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.197
- Kind of hard to miss.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.633
I opened up the closet
 door and it yelled at me.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.137
Yeah.
   - Hey, um,

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:37.839
I gotta talk to
  you for a minute.

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:38.673
- Okay.

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:39.507
- Okay.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:40.342
Excuse us.

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:52.654
- You know, I forgot how
 much fun this all was.

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:55.657
Nobody does Cookiemas
  like your mom.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.631
What's wrong?

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:05.600
- This came to me
  in the mail today.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:08.670
I wasn't sure
  whether I should show

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:10.672
it to you or not, but...

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.917
- It's from Maeve.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.520
You found out who she is.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:27.422
- I've known all along.

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:31.726
She's Alice's daughter.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.597
Lucy, Maeve is your niece.

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:52.013
Lucy, Lucy, wait!

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:53.615
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.816
- Alice wasn't just my friend,

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:56.885
she was also my client.

01:05:56.887 --> 01:05:58.253
She didn't want anybody to know,

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:01.556
and I had to
  respect her privacy.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.991
- But, why?

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:05.126
Why would she keep it a secret?

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.729
- She had her reasons.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:11.333
She had the baby just before
 coming home from college.

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:15.270
She wasn't sure how to
 break it to your family.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:19.074
There were so many expectations,

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:22.110
about her future, and
  she just didn't want

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.846
to disappoint your parents.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:26.514
- This is what she
  wanted to tell me.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:29.284
The night of the accident.

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:31.386
But I wouldn't listen.

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:38.994
- Don't run away from
  me, Lucy, please.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:40.495
Not again!

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:43.732
- Do you know how hard it
 was for to to leave, Peter?

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.400
To leave this place?

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:48.970
To leave you?

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:51.573
- So why'd you do it?

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:53.842
- Because it was my fault!

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:56.644
Alice's accident
 happened because I wanted

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:57.879
to be with you.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:02.417
If she hadn't come to
  get me that night...

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:07.355
Every time I saw you, it
 reminded me of what happened.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.958
Everything in this
  town reminds me

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.527
that I ruined my sister's life.

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.531
- Lucy, Alice had a good life.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.903
Maybe not the one that
  she expected to have,

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:25.640
or the one that your
 parents planned for her,

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.076
but she was happy.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.046
She had friends who loved her.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.248
She had a meaningful
 job that fulfilled her.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.516
And she made a
 difference in the lives

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.017
of so many people.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.687
And maybe it wasn't like yours.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.157
Maybe it wasn't
  like other people's.

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:44.492
But it was her very own.

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.828
And for her, it was perfect.

01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:52.033
- Alice was my big sister.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:55.637
You know, she took care of me,

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:58.139
and I, I wasn't there for her.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.210
I haven't been for long time.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.080
- Don't blame yourself.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.315
Alice never did.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.654
She was so proud of you,
 of everything you've done,

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.823
of everything you are.

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:16.224
- Now she's gone.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.894
You know I can never
  make it up to her.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.363
- Well, there's one way.

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:24.732
Alice loved Christmas.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:27.801
And Christmas is the
  time for forgiving.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:31.639
So why don't you give
 her one last gift, hey?

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.041
Forgive yourself.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.743
- I don't know how!

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:38.880
- Maybe this'll help.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.015
I talked to Maeve.

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.386
I told her about you, and
 she wants to meet you.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:47.221
- Peter.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:48.857
- She's your niece.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:49.924
She's your family.

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:50.758
- I'm sorry.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.493
No, I'm sorry,

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:53.694
but I can't.

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:55.095
- Lucy.
 - Look, no, I can't do that!

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:57.765
- Lucy!

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:56.758
- Hi!

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:57.892
Here we are!

01:09:57.894 --> 01:09:58.826
Lucy!

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:01.129
- Hi, honey, you been crying?

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:04.098
What's wrong?

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:08.069
- I thought they
  were self-portraits.

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:12.407
But she was drawing
 Maeve, imagining the girl

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:13.908
she grew up to be.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:21.082
- Alice had a daughter,
 and none of us knew?

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.251
- I was a horrible sister.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:27.355
- That's ridiculous, Lucy.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.590
- Alice loved you.

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:30.458
She was always
  talking about you,

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.260
about everything
  that you did for her.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.229
- For her, not with her.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.533
I should've been here more.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:39.801
- No, you couldn't.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.936
You had your own
  life to live, too.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:45.807
- You know, I thought I
 had everything organized,

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.809
and everything in its place.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.277
And now I just feel like,

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:53.448
my whole world is falling
 into pieces.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:57.185
- Well then there's
  only one thing to do.

01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:59.587
You've gotta put it
  back together again.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.090
Lucy, life is like this quilt.

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:05.927
It's pieces of everything,

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:10.098
some joy, some sadness,
 some laughter, some tears.

01:11:13.203 --> 01:11:17.472
All of us are just stitchin'
 it together, you know.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.244
- I might not make a
  whole lotta sense now,

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:24.412
but it will when you're done.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.014
- And sometimes not even then.

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:30.818
- But if you do it with love,

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.255
it will turn out to
  be a beautiful thing.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:39.227
- Alice was so lucky to have
 the three of you as friends.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.030
- We were so lucky to have her.

01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:45.967
- And we're lucky
  to have you too.

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:51.339
Yeah.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:59.781
- Now, whatta you say
  we finish that quilt?

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:00.615
- Yes.

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:01.449
Oh, and some tea?

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.551
Would you drink tea?
  - Yeah.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:04.385
- Come on.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.223
- I can't believe
  it's finally done.

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:10.858
- Not quite.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.193
Finishing touch.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.514
- Oh!

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.552
- You see, I told you.

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:39.220
It's just a matter of time.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:40.688
- Freckles, hello.

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:45.760
- Hello.
  - It's good to say hi.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:46.861
- Hi.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.296
- Do you like the quilts?

01:12:48.298 --> 01:12:49.297
- Good boy.

01:12:49.299 --> 01:12:51.132
Yeah.

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:55.236
- I was just going over
 the documents, and I,

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.271
Merry Christmas, have
  a great Christmas.

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:58.806
And we need to
  revisit the contract

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.575
because it's not by right.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:03.411
- Joe, something just came up.

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.279
Uh, I'll call you back later.

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:07.048
- Lucy, this is a
  very important client.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.616
We need to make
  sure he's compliant

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:09.717
with the...
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.220
I know, but I gotta go.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:13.955
Merry Christmas, Joe.

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:21.062
Mr. Freckles!

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.232
Enjoy your lunch.

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:26.234
I have an errand to run.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:46.854
It's not by right.

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:48.322
- By right?

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.490
- Use by right.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.627
Only certain businesses
 are permitted to operate

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.595
in certain parts of the town.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.197
This is the building
  permit application

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:59.567
the developer filed
  with the town clerk.

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:01.569
See the office buildings
 they wanna put here?

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:03.671
They're not by right.

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.506
- So what does that mean for us?

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.509
- They'll need to get a
variance from the town council.

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:11.679
The developer has to go in
 front of the planning board.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:14.415
- Which means an open hearing
 in front of the whole town.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:16.451
- Where it can be denied.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.985
- And with all the
  signatures we got,

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.455
and the flyers we posted,
 everybody in Nilson's Bay

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.856
will be on our side.

01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:22.824
- In the meantime,
  I'll files a cease

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.892
and desist order, and oh,

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:28.329
except I can't.

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:29.464
- Why not?

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.731
You're a lawyer.

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:32.733
- From out of state.

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:35.303
I'm not licensed for Wisconsin.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:40.441
But I know somebody who is.

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:50.718
- Hi.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.220
- Hi, can we talk?

01:14:58.127 --> 01:14:59.560
- You were right.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:01.796
You got em.

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:03.264
- So you think we have a case?

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.832
- I know we do.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.168
I'll file it in the morning.

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:10.905
Nice work, counselor.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:11.906
- Thank you, counselor.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.576
And I'm sorry.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:18.112
- No need to be.

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:21.048
You had every right
  to be upset yesterday.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.951
I should have told you before.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:24.785
- No.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:28.389
You did the right thing.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:29.891
Now it's up to me.

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.227
I wanna meet my niece.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:02.557
No, no.

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:22.109
Does this tree look a
  little crooked to you?

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:23.945
- The tree is perfect.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.017
Everything is perfect.

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:31.552
- I just want everything
 to be really nice

01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:32.887
for her, you know?

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:35.890
- Lucy, honey, she's
  gonna love you.

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:39.694
- Oh!

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:41.362
Oh, my.

01:16:46.536 --> 01:16:49.637
- Lucy Toomey, meet Maeve Guy.

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:51.772
Maeve, this is your aunt.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.240
- Hello.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:56.077
- Hello, it's so
  good to meet you.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.326
This is Uncle Barney.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:14.395
- Hello, Maeve.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:15.763
Welcome to the family, darling.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:16.764
- Thank you.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:20.001
It's so good to be here.

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.371
- You look like your mom.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.409
- Hey, Pete, can you
 help me out for a second?

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:29.243
- Sure.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.381
- Come in, come in.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.589
Would you like some tea?

01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:43.858
Or how bout some hot cocoa?

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.059
Yeah, let's get some hot cocoa.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.594
Come on.

01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:49.130
So your parents kept your name.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.433
- They thought it was pretty.

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:53.934
- It is.

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:55.436
- I think so, too.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.540
I'm sorry, I'm kinda nervous.

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:04.378
- Me too.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:14.288
- This is a beautiful house.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.757
- Thank you.

01:18:16.759 --> 01:18:20.194
Alice, your Mom, she
  kept it up nicely.

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.165
- Hi, who are you?

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:26.701
- That's Mr. Freckles.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:27.802
Don't worry about him.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:28.636
He doesn't like anybody.

01:18:28.638 --> 01:18:30.071
- I love animals.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.710
- So did your mom.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.548
- Is that her?

01:18:42.652 --> 01:18:45.219
- Uh, huh, that's Alice.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.023
- What was she like?

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:53.961
- I have an idea.

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:00.534
- That's you and Mom?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.105
- She loved Christmas,

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:06.273
ever since she was little.

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:09.944
That was her

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:10.878
first performance.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.580
at the church at Christmas.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.148
She was so nervous.

01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:17.118
- She's so good.

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:19.820
- First chair.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:22.590
- Always wondered who she was,

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:26.694
ever since my parents
  told me I was adopted.

01:19:26.696 --> 01:19:28.863
I had a million questions.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.733
What was her favorite song?

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:35.236
What did her laugh sound like?

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.009
And did she ever think of me?

01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.782
- You stay right there.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:58.025
I know it's not
  quite Christmas, yet,

01:19:58.027 --> 01:20:00.394
but I think she'd understand.

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.099
- What is this?

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:07.434
- It's a gift from your mom.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:15.910
She made this for you.

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:19.713
- She made this?

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:23.818
- With a little help
  from some friends.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:33.761
- For Maeve.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.967
- She made one for you.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:43.771
For every Christmas she missed.

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:53.147
- I'm sorry.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:55.783
This is a lot.

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:01.689
- Um, are you up for a drive?

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:07.895
- To where?

01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:10.297
- It's a surprise.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.934
Do you like gingerbread?

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.613
- Wow.

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:29.617
- Your mom and I used to
 come here every Christmas

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:31.118
when we were kids.

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:36.824
Oh, come on, there's some
 people I want you to meet.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:39.493
- You made it.

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:40.728
- Hi.

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.863
This is Alice's daughter.

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:43.931
And my niece.

01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:46.934
This is Maeve.

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:49.870
This is Daphne,
  Celia, and Rinda.

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:51.572
They were your
  mom's best friends.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.741
- It's very nice to meet you.

01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:55.643
- The pleasure is
  all ours, Maeve.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:57.811
- You have her eyes.

01:21:57.813 --> 01:21:59.346
- I think I'm gonna cry.

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:02.416
- Maeve has been asking
 questions about Alice's life

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.984
here in Nilson's Bay.

01:22:03.986 --> 01:22:07.221
I thought maybe you could
 share some stories with her.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:09.290
- Yes, that we can do.
  - Of course.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:11.091
- Come sit.

01:22:13.896 --> 01:22:14.728
- Hey.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:16.563
Hey, psst.

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:20.467
How's it goin?

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.469
- Peter, she's wonderful.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.972
She's so much like Alice.

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:26.573
But she's her own person too.

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:29.443
- Yep, she's her mother's
 daughter, that's for sure.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:33.380
Hey, I filed that
  cease and desist.

01:22:33.382 --> 01:22:34.581
- And?

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:35.816
- The developer's legal
 department called me

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:38.686
about 15 minutes
  later, in a panic.

01:22:38.688 --> 01:22:41.155
- Hmm, and did they say?

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:42.122
- I don't know.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.925
I let it go to voice mail.

01:22:46.095 --> 01:22:47.294
It's Christmas.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:51.265
- I like how you
  work, Mr. Swinson.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:52.967
- Why thank you, Miss Toomey.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:58.639
You know, I'm lookin for
 a partner in my firm,

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.908
preferably somebody
 with big-city experience

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:04.578
but who understands
  small town life.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.880
You know anybody like that?

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:09.717
- Are you suggesting that
 I leave my corporate job

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:12.453
and start fighting
  for the little guy?

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:13.954
- Why not?

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:16.457
I think we'd make a good team.

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:22.062
- Go on.

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:23.764
- What is it, Maeve?

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:26.667
- I was just wondering,
 if it's okay,

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:29.403
could my family and
  I come for Christmas?

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:30.337
- Oh, I think that...

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.039
- That would be wonderful.

01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:34.775
Tell me, do your folks
  like turkey or ham?

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:35.743
Because we're gonna have both.

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.880
I just wanna know so I know
 just how much to order.

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:41.048
- Both.

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.249
- Good, that was simple.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:46.587
- Peter,
 you were gonna go check

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:48.389
out the gingerbread houses

01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:49.823
- Oh, yeah, I checked them out.

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:52.259
- Rinda's gingerbread houses.

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:53.227
You should have a bite.

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:54.595
- The ginger,

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.030
I'm checking out the
  gingerbread houses.

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:56.964
- Right.

01:23:58.434 --> 01:24:02.936
Well I was wondering if it's
time for us to change our name.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.338
From FOA to FOL.

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:10.244
- Friends of Lucy.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:12.913
- I like that.
