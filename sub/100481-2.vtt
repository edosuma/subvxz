01:48.700 --> 01:51.500
AT HER APARTMENT BUILDING.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.867

WIDESPREAD PROTESTS, WHICH

01:56.100 --> 01:57.066
FOX NEWS SOUGHT TO DOWNPLAY WITH

01:57.133 --> 01:59.433
THE HELP OF THIS FORMER COP.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.800
YOU HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:02.867 --> 02:03.700
FOR -- DANIEL CAMERON FOR THE

02:03.767 --> 02:06.066
STATE OF KENTUCKY WHO ANNOUNCED

02:06.133 --> 02:08.699
THE CHARGE AND ALSO THE CITY

02:08.767 --> 02:12.333
PAID $12 MILLION TO THE FAMILY,

02:12.400 --> 02:13.600
AND YOU HAVE TO ASK, WHY ARE THE

02:13.667 --> 02:16.300
DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUING?

02:16.367 --> 02:18.500
ARE -- IT'S ONLY CONTINUING, IN

02:18.567 --> 02:19.166
MY MIND, BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:19.233 --> 02:20.066
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN

02:20.133 --> 02:24.166
AGENDA.

02:24.233 --> 02:27.300
John: NOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS

02:27.367 --> 02:27.967
AWFUL, AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

02:28.033 --> 02:28.800
BUT TRY AND LOOK AT IT FROM HIS

02:28.867 --> 02:29.300
PERSPECTIVE: THE COPS IN

02:29.367 --> 02:30.367
QUESTION WERE INVESTIGATED, LET

02:30.433 --> 02:31.000
OFF, AND THE VICTIM'S FAMILY WAS

02:31.066 --> 02:32.200
PAID OFF WITH TAXPAYER MONEY.

02:32.266 --> 02:33.567
FROM A FORMER POLICE OFFICER'S

02:33.633 --> 02:35.166
POINT OF VIEW, THAT'S THE SYSTEM

02:35.233 --> 02:37.934
WORKING AS DESIGNED --

02:38.000 --> 02:39.867
AND THAT IS KIND OF THE WHOLE

02:39.934 --> 02:40.433
FUCKING PROBLEM HERE.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.867
BUT OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

02:42.934 --> 02:43.433
CONCERNS THE FACT THAT, LAST

02:43.500 --> 02:44.000
WEEKEND, RUTH BADER GINSBURG

02:44.066 --> 02:44.567
DIED, WHICH WAS DISTRESSING

02:44.633 --> 02:45.533
ENOUGH.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.800
BUT IT'S BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE

02:47.867 --> 02:48.533
FACT THAT JUST YESTERDAY, THIS

02:48.600 --> 02:53.033
HAPPENED:

02:53.100 --> 02:55.767
GOOD EVENING, WE BEGIN WITH

02:55.834 --> 02:58.834
THE NUMERIC BREAKING NEWS.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.900
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATING ANY CO.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.200
BARRETT IS FAVORITE OF

03:02.266 --> 03:03.433
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES FOR HER

03:03.500 --> 03:05.934
STRONG ANTI-ABORTION RIGHTS

03:06.000 --> 03:07.333
VIEWS AND, IF CONFIRMED, WOULD

03:07.400 --> 03:08.567
MOVE THE COURT TO THE RIGHT FOR

03:08.633 --> 03:08.934
A GENERATION.

03:09.000 --> 03:09.700
John: RIGHT, TRUMP IS ABOUT

03:09.767 --> 03:10.300
TO REPLACE A LIBERAL ICON WITH

03:10.367 --> 03:10.834
AN EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE

03:10.900 --> 03:11.433
JUSTICE WHO'S BEEN CALLED THE

03:11.500 --> 03:12.033
FEMALE ANTONIN SCALIA, AND SHE

03:12.100 --> 03:12.900
COULD SERVE FOR A LONG, LONG

03:12.967 --> 03:14.667
TIME.

03:14.734 --> 03:15.800
AMY CONEY BARRETT IS ONLY 48,

03:15.867 --> 03:17.266
AND I KNOW THAT I MAKE 43 LOOK

03:17.333 --> 03:20.533
LIKE 76, BUT TRUST ME, THAT'S

03:20.600 --> 03:21.333
YOUNG FOR A SUPREME COURT

03:21.400 --> 03:22.367
JUSTICE.

03:22.433 --> 03:23.467
AND LOOK, IF -- AND ALMOST

03:23.533 --> 03:24.667
CERTAINLY WHEN -- BARRETT IS

03:24.734 --> 03:25.834
CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT,

03:25.900 --> 03:27.533
THE IMPACT COULD BE DIRE.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.633
IN RECENT YEARS, KEY CASES HAVE

03:28.700 --> 03:35.400
BEEN DECIDED BY JUST ONE VOTE,

03:35.467 --> 03:36.066
FROM UPHOLDING THE AFFORDABLE

03:36.133 --> 03:36.867
CARE ACT TO PRESERVING DACA TO

03:36.934 --> 03:37.467
STRIKING DOWN AN INCREDIBLY

03:37.533 --> 03:38.367
RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAW.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.300
SHOULD THOSE ISSUES COME BEFORE

03:39.367 --> 03:40.266
THE COURT AGAIN, THEY COULD NOW

03:40.333 --> 03:44.533
EASILY GO THE OTHER WAY.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.133
AND THERE IS CLEARLY NO POINT

03:45.200 --> 03:45.767
HOLDING ONTO HOPE THAT

03:45.834 --> 03:46.533
CONSERVATIVES MIGHT CHOOSE TO

03:46.600 --> 03:52.166
RESPECT THE PRECEDENT THEY SET

03:52.233 --> 03:52.767
BY REFUSING TO EVEN CONSIDER

03:52.834 --> 03:53.400
MERRICK GARLAND IN AN ELECTION

03:53.467 --> 03:54.066
YEAR, BECAUSE THAT WAS ALWAYS IN

03:54.133 --> 03:54.700
BAD FAITH, AS WAS OBVIOUS AT THE

03:54.767 --> 03:55.066
TIME.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.333
IN FACT, AHEAD OF THE 2016

03:56.400 --> 03:57.767
ELECTION, SENATOR RICHARD BURR

03:57.834 --> 03:58.734
EVEN PRIVATELY SAID THIS TO A

03:58.800 --> 04:01.900
GROUP OF CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS:

04:01.967 --> 04:04.834
IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES

04:04.900 --> 04:06.567
PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO DO

04:06.633 --> 04:14.567
EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE

04:14.633 --> 04:15.834
SURE THAT, FOUR YEARS FROM NOW,

04:15.900 --> 04:16.433
WE STILL GOT AN OPENING ON THE

04:16.500 --> 04:17.300
SUPREME COURT.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.132
John: YEAH, THAT'S A

04:18.200 --> 04:18.934
REPUBLICAN SENATOR COMMITTING TO

04:19.000 --> 04:19.934
BLOCKING A JUSTICE CONFIRMATION,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.100
NOT JUST IN AN ELECTION YEAR,

04:21.166 --> 04:21.700
BUT FOR AN ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL

04:21.767 --> 04:22.867
TERM.

04:22.934 --> 04:23.800
AND JUST THINK ABOUT HOW LONG

04:23.867 --> 04:25.767
FOUR YEARS IS.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.000
FOUR YEARS AGO, HARVEY WEINSTEIN

04:27.066 --> 04:28.567
WAS STILL PRODUCING MOVIES.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.400
IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS,

04:30.467 --> 04:31.367
HARRY AND MEGHAN BEGAN DATING,

04:31.433 --> 04:32.567
GOT ENGAGED, GOT MARRIED, LEFT

04:32.633 --> 04:34.867
THE ROYAL FAMILY, AND I THINK

04:34.934 --> 04:36.200
OWN NETFLIX NOW?

04:36.266 --> 04:37.300
AND IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS,

04:37.367 --> 04:38.800
LEONARDO DiCAPRIO'S GIRLFRIEND

04:38.867 --> 04:39.867
GAINED THE RIGHT TO LEGALLY

04:39.934 --> 04:41.066
DRINK ALCOHOL.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.300
TWO MORE YEARS, AND SHE'LL

04:42.367 --> 04:43.667
HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING

04:43.734 --> 04:44.633
A RENTAL CAR...

04:44.700 --> 04:45.433
TO MOVE HER BELONGINGS OUT OF

04:45.500 --> 04:46.333
HIS HOUSE.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.266
TIME IS AMAZING.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.200
AND SOME REPUBLICANS SEEM TO

04:49.266 --> 04:50.467
RATIONALIZE THEIR PARTY'S

04:50.533 --> 04:51.467
BLATANT HYPOCRISY BY SAYING

04:51.533 --> 04:52.600
THAT, SHOULD THEY CONFIRM

04:52.667 --> 04:53.533
TRUMP'S NOMINEE, THEY'LL SIMPLY

04:53.600 --> 04:54.967
BE BRINGING THE COURT CLOSER TO

04:55.033 --> 04:57.233
THE WILL OF THE COUNTRY.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.967
I RECOGNIZE THAT WE MAY HAVE

05:00.033 --> 05:01.533
A COURT WHICH HAS MORE OF A

05:01.600 --> 05:06.533
CONSERVATIVE BENT THAN IT'S HAD

05:06.600 --> 05:08.133
OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, BUT

05:08.200 --> 05:09.533
MY LIBERAL FRIENDS HAVE, OVER

05:09.600 --> 05:10.767
MANY DECADES, GOTTEN VERY USED

05:10.834 --> 05:12.433
TO THE IDEA OF HAVING A LIBERAL

05:12.500 --> 05:13.600
COURT, AND THAT'S NOT WRITTEN IN

05:13.667 --> 05:14.600
THE STARS.

05:14.667 --> 05:15.667
IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE FOR A

05:15.734 --> 05:17.200
NATION WHICH IS, IF YOU WILL,

05:17.266 --> 05:18.567
CENTER RIGHT, TO HAVE A COURT

05:18.633 --> 05:19.700
WHICH REFLECTS CENTER RIGHT

05:19.767 --> 05:22.066
POINTS OF VIEW.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.233
John: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

05:23.300 --> 05:24.700
TALKING ABOUT, MITT?

05:24.767 --> 05:25.900
SET ASIDE THE NOTION THAT A

05:25.967 --> 05:26.900
COURT THAT GUTTED THE VOTING

05:26.967 --> 05:28.533
RIGHTS ACT IS A "LIBERAL COURT,"

05:28.600 --> 05:30.567
SINCE WHEN IS THIS NATION

05:30.633 --> 05:33.066
NATURALLY CENTER RIGHT?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.066
DID WE ALL TAKE A BUZZFEED QUIZ

05:35.133 --> 05:36.033
THAT I'M NOT REMEMBERING, LIKE

05:36.100 --> 05:36.700
"CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE

05:36.767 --> 05:37.533
FALL LASAGNA INGREDIENTS AND

05:37.600 --> 05:38.433
WE'LL TELL YOU WHICH DIRECTION

05:38.500 --> 05:40.300
THE NATION'S ELECTORATE LEANS?"

05:40.367 --> 05:41.567
BECAUSE, FOR THE RECORD, MORE

05:41.633 --> 05:42.533
AMERICANS SAY THEY ALIGN WITH

05:42.600 --> 05:44.333
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAN THE

05:44.400 --> 05:45.467
REPUBLICANS.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.133
PLUS, POLL AFTER POLL HAS SHOWN

05:47.200 --> 05:49.433
AMERICANS FAVOR ABORTION RIGHTS,

05:49.500 --> 05:53.033
WITH SUPPORT OF ROE V. WADE

05:53.100 --> 05:53.867
REACHING RECORD HIGHS, WHILE A

05:53.934 --> 05:54.834
STRONG MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC

05:54.900 --> 05:56.300
ALSO SUPPORTS MEDICARE FOR ALL.

05:56.367 --> 05:57.667
OH, AND INCIDENTALLY, A SOLID

05:57.734 --> 05:58.700
MAJORITY SAY THE WINNER OF THIS

05:58.767 --> 05:59.800
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHOULD BE

05:59.867 --> 06:01.000
THE ONE TO CHOOSE GINSBURG'S

06:01.066 --> 06:02.266
SUCCESSOR.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.500
SO OUR COUNTRY ISN'T SO MUCH

06:03.567 --> 06:05.066
CENTER RIGHT AS MITT ROMNEY IS

06:05.133 --> 06:06.867
CENTER WRONG.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.567
LOOK, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY DARK

06:08.633 --> 06:10.800
WEEK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

06:10.867 --> 06:12.000
THE SUPREME COURT IS ABOUT TO

06:12.066 --> 06:13.433
LURCH TO THE RIGHT FOR THE

06:13.500 --> 06:15.800
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.400
AND IF THINGS SEEM HOPELESS

06:17.467 --> 06:18.600
RIGHT NOW, IT'S BECAUSE, TO BE

06:18.667 --> 06:19.667
COMPLETELY HONEST, THEY

06:19.734 --> 06:21.633
BASICALLY ARE.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.667
THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT, AND

06:23.734 --> 06:25.867
WHILE WE GOT HERE A LITTLE BIT

06:25.934 --> 06:27.600
BY BAD LUCK AND BAD TIMING, WE

06:27.667 --> 06:29.333
ALSO GOT HERE THROUGH DILIGENT

06:29.400 --> 06:31.333
EFFORT BY REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

06:31.400 --> 06:32.567
AND, CRUCIALLY, SOME VERY BIG

06:32.633 --> 06:33.800
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WHICH JUST

06:33.867 --> 06:35.767
HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.367
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

06:37.433 --> 06:39.900
THAT: SPECIFICALLY, HOW THE FUCK

06:39.967 --> 06:41.166
WE GOT HERE AND WHAT THE FUCK WE

06:41.233 --> 06:43.066
CAN POSSIBLY DO NEXT.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.033
AND THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO

06:44.100 --> 06:45.100
MAJOR FACTORS THAT BROUGHT US TO

06:45.166 --> 06:46.400
THIS POINT.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.567
THE FIRST IS THIS MAN,

06:47.633 --> 06:48.934
MITCH McCONNELL, THE ONLY THING

06:49.000 --> 06:50.100
TO COME OUT OF KENTUCKY MORE

06:50.166 --> 06:51.633
SHAMELESS THAN THE KFC MENU.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.867
HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR CHICKEN?

06:52.934 --> 06:53.633
REGULAR?

06:53.700 --> 06:54.300
CRISPY?

06:54.367 --> 06:55.400
CHEETO-FLAVORED?

06:55.467 --> 06:56.633
IN A WARM SLURRY?

06:56.700 --> 06:57.967
AS BREAD?

06:58.033 --> 06:59.200
'CAUSE IT'S ALL ON THE TABLE.

06:59.266 --> 07:00.533
AT KFC, WE PROMISE:

07:00.600 --> 07:01.667
MAXIMUM FLAVOR FOR YOU,

07:01.734 --> 07:03.166
MAXIMUM DISRESPECT FOR A

07:03.233 --> 07:05.600
CHICKEN'S MEMORY.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.633
RECONFIGURING AMERICA'S COURTS

07:06.700 --> 07:07.967
HAS BEEN A SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS

07:08.033 --> 07:08.934
FOR McCONNELL.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.600
TRUMP ONCE MARVELED TO

07:11.667 --> 07:12.600
BOB WOODWARD THAT "YOU KNOW WHAT

07:12.667 --> 07:13.633
MITCH'S BIGGEST THING IS IN THE

07:13.700 --> 07:14.767
WHOLE WORLD?

07:14.834 --> 07:16.000
HIS JUDGES."

07:16.066 --> 07:16.900
AND HIS OBSESSION ISN'T JUST

07:16.967 --> 07:19.800
WITH THE SUPREME COURT.

07:19.867 --> 07:20.467
McCONNELL'S BLOCKADE OF

07:20.533 --> 07:21.667
MERRICK GARLAND JUSTIFIABLY GOT

07:21.734 --> 07:23.066
A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT HE ALSO

07:23.133 --> 07:25.033
MADE SURE TRUMP COULD STACK THE

07:25.100 --> 07:26.433
LOWER COURTS WITH CONSERVATIVE

07:26.500 --> 07:27.700
JUDGES, SOMETHING TRUMP ALSO

07:27.767 --> 07:31.133
EXPLAINED TO WOODWARD.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.400
I'M GOING TO BE UP TO

07:32.467 --> 07:33.300
280 JUDGES VERY SOON.

07:33.367 --> 07:35.166
NOBODY'S EVER HAD THAT.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.166
280.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.900
OBAMA GAVE US 142 JUDGES WHEN I

07:38.967 --> 07:40.834
CAME HERE.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.867
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

07:41.934 --> 07:43.133
YOU NEVER HAD ONE.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.700
IF YOU WERE A PRESIDENT, YOU

07:44.767 --> 07:46.333
WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY FEDERAL --

07:46.400 --> 07:46.934
THEY WERE LIKE GOLDEN NUGGETS,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.834
RIGHT?

07:49.900 --> 07:50.967
John: OKAY, FIRST, IT'S WEIRD

07:51.033 --> 07:51.500
TO REFER TO ANYTHING AS

07:51.567 --> 07:52.367
"GOLDEN NUGGETS" UNLESS

07:52.433 --> 07:53.900
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL

07:53.967 --> 07:55.600
GOLDEN NUGGETS OR YOU'RE

07:55.667 --> 07:56.533
DESCRIBING YOUR HUSBAND'S BALLS

07:56.600 --> 07:57.500
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS

07:57.567 --> 07:58.600
TIGER-THEMED FUNERAL WHILE

07:58.667 --> 07:59.900
IMPERSONATING A PRIEST.

07:59.967 --> 08:00.967
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PERFECTLY

08:01.033 --> 08:03.233
APPROPRIATE TIMES.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.667
BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY, OBAMA VERY

08:04.734 --> 08:05.800
MUCH DIDN'T DELIBERATELY LEAVE

08:05.867 --> 08:07.500
THOSE VACANCIES OPEN FOR TRUMP.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.233
WHEN REPUBLICANS TOOK THE SENATE

08:09.300 --> 08:11.700
IN 2014, MITCH McCONNELL BEGAN

08:11.767 --> 08:15.333
SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKING

08:15.400 --> 08:16.100
LOWER COURT APPOINTEES SO A

08:16.166 --> 08:16.900
FUTURE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT

08:16.967 --> 08:18.200
COULD FILL THE SEATS LATER.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.700
SO OBAMA DIDN'T GIVE TRUMP THOSE

08:19.767 --> 08:20.867
JUDGES ANY MORE THAN THE

08:20.934 --> 08:21.967
NATIONAL ARCHIVES GAVE

08:22.033 --> 08:22.867
NICOLAS CAGE THE DECLARATION OF

08:22.934 --> 08:24.834
INDEPENDENCE.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.233
IN FACT, OBAMA'S ONLY EVER GIVEN

08:26.300 --> 08:28.400
TRUMP TWO THINGS: A BRIEF TOUR

08:28.467 --> 08:30.000
OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND A

08:30.066 --> 08:31.400
COLOSSAL INFERIORITY COMPLEX

08:31.467 --> 08:32.533
THAT FUELED TRUMP'S RISE TO

08:32.600 --> 08:33.866
POWER AND MADE HIM SO FURIOUS HE

08:33.933 --> 08:35.700
DECIDED TO TURN AMERICA INTO AN

08:35.767 --> 08:36.799
APOCALYPTIC HELLSCAPE AND

08:36.866 --> 08:39.332
DESTROY DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.265
REALLY JUST THOSE TWO THINGS.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.066
AND McCONNELL'S WILLINGNESS TO

08:44.133 --> 08:44.667
GO TO THE MAT FOR JUDICIAL

08:44.734 --> 08:45.467
APPOINTMENTS WAS PERHAPS NEVER

08:45.533 --> 08:46.633
MORE OBVIOUS THAN DURING THE

08:46.700 --> 08:47.500
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS, BECAUSE

08:47.567 --> 08:48.567
IMMEDIATELY AFTER

08:48.633 --> 08:49.567
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

08:49.633 --> 08:51.667
GUT-WRENCHING TESTIMONY,

08:51.734 --> 08:52.533
McCONNELL APPARENTLY HAD THIS

08:52.600 --> 08:54.200
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT.

08:54.266 --> 08:54.967
BOTH OF THEM ARE KIND OF

08:55.033 --> 08:56.000
TESTING EACH OTHER A BIT.

08:56.066 --> 08:56.800
"WHERE ARE YOU AT ON THIS?"

08:56.867 --> 08:58.567
YOU KNOW, "HOW STRONG ARE YOU?"

08:58.633 --> 09:00.133
AND McCONNELL BASICALLY SAYS TO

09:00.200 --> 09:01.333
THE PRESIDENT, "YOU DON'T WORRY

09:01.400 --> 09:02.100
ABOUT ME.

09:02.166 --> 09:02.967
I'M STRONG AS MULE PISS."

09:03.033 --> 09:03.767
THAT'S HIS QUOTE.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.367
"I'M STRONG AS MULE PISS."

09:06.433 --> 09:07.533
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S NOT GOING

09:07.600 --> 09:08.433
TO LET UP, HE'S NOT GOING TO

09:08.500 --> 09:09.333
GIVE UP, HE'S NOT GOING TO

09:09.400 --> 09:10.500
SURRENDER.

09:10.567 --> 09:11.734
John: WOW.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.967
THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.500
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT

09:15.567 --> 09:17.367
AFTER BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY,

09:17.433 --> 09:18.433
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION FELT A

09:18.500 --> 09:20.467
LOT LESS CERTAIN.

09:20.533 --> 09:21.800
AND TO REACT TO WHAT SHE SAID

09:21.867 --> 09:23.934
WITH, "DON'T WORRY, I'M STRONG

09:24.000 --> 09:25.867
AS MULE PISS" IS BOTH HORRENDOUS

09:25.934 --> 09:27.934
AND DEEPLY WEIRD.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.433
QUICK SIDE NOTE: I WASN'T SURE

09:29.500 --> 09:30.233
HOW STRONG MULE PISS ACTUALLY

09:30.300 --> 09:31.033
IS, AND THE INTERNET IS

09:31.100 --> 09:32.500
SURPRISINGLY SHORT OF VIDEOS OF

09:32.567 --> 09:34.000
MULES URINATING.

09:34.066 --> 09:35.533
ALTHOUGH WE DID FIND MANAGE TO

09:35.600 --> 09:37.533
FIND THIS STOCK FOOTAGE TITLED

09:37.600 --> 09:38.867
"DONKEY WHO URINE AT SUNSET,"

09:38.934 --> 09:41.166
AND I HAVE TO SAY, THAT IS AN

09:41.233 --> 09:45.767
IMPRESSIVELY STRONG STREAM.

09:45.834 --> 09:46.667
SO I DO TOTALLY GET IT NOW.

09:46.734 --> 09:47.300
AND GOING FORWARD, EVERY TIME I

09:47.367 --> 09:49.834
THINK OF MITCH McCONNELL, I WILL

09:49.900 --> 09:50.934
THINK OF THAT DONKEY

09:51.000 --> 09:52.967
WHO URINE AT SUNSET.

09:53.033 --> 09:54.233
BUT AS EASY AND FUN AS IT IS TO

09:54.300 --> 09:55.000
BLAME MITCH McCONNELL AND HIS

09:55.066 --> 09:56.834
MULE PISS FOR EVERYTHING, IT'S A

09:56.900 --> 09:58.934
MISTAKE TO FOCUS JUST ON THE

09:59.000 --> 10:01.633
PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE, BECAUSE

10:01.700 --> 10:02.400
THERE IS A WHOLE SYSTEM

10:02.467 --> 10:05.800
UNDERNEATH THEM THAT HAS ENABLED

10:05.867 --> 10:06.333
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.133
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

10:07.200 --> 10:08.000
MAJOR FACTOR THAT GOT US TO

10:08.066 --> 10:08.934
WHERE WE ARE NOW: THE DEEPLY

10:09.000 --> 10:10.133
UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF

10:10.200 --> 10:14.767
AMERICA'S INSTITUTIONS.

10:14.834 --> 10:15.467
BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT, THE

10:15.533 --> 10:16.233
REPUBLICAN PARTY CURRENTLY

10:16.300 --> 10:18.734
CONTROLS BOTH THE SENATE AND THE

10:18.800 --> 10:21.700
WHITE HOUSE.

10:21.767 --> 10:22.333
IT'S TRUE.

10:22.400 --> 10:22.867
AND THEY WILL ARGUE

10:22.934 --> 10:23.500
THIS GIVES THEM A MANDATE TO DO

10:23.567 --> 10:24.266
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.367
CHRIS, THE SENATE MAJORITY IS

10:25.433 --> 10:25.967
PERFORMING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

10:26.033 --> 10:26.800
DUTY AND FULFILLING THE MANDATE

10:26.867 --> 10:29.600
THAT THE VOTERS GAVE US.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.200
VOTERS HAVE ELECTED A

10:30.266 --> 10:30.967
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.

10:31.033 --> 10:31.800
THEY ELECTED A REPUBLICAN

10:31.867 --> 10:33.033
SENATE.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.867
AND I THINK REPUBLICANS NEED TO

10:35.934 --> 10:36.467
KEEP THEIR PROMISES HERE, AND

10:36.533 --> 10:37.600
THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

10:37.667 --> 10:38.200
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED

10:38.266 --> 10:39.767
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A REPUBLICAN

10:39.834 --> 10:40.967
MAJORITY BECAUSE WE WANT THE

10:41.033 --> 10:41.900
CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS

10:41.967 --> 10:43.767
PROTECTED, AND THAT IS OUR JOB.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.333
IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.266
John: I DO NOT LIKE THAT MAN

10:46.333 --> 10:47.367
TED CRUZ.

10:47.433 --> 10:47.967
I DO NOT LIKE

10:48.033 --> 10:49.000
HIS BACKWARD VIEWS.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.600
I DO NOT LIKE HIS STUPID SUITS.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.667
I DO NOT LIKE HIS COWBOY BOOTS.

10:52.734 --> 10:53.433
I DO NOT LIKE HIM WHEN

10:53.500 --> 10:54.433
HE SNEEZES.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.333
I DO NOT LIKE HIM

10:55.400 --> 10:56.667
EATING CHEESES.

10:56.734 --> 10:58.100
I HATE TO SEE

10:58.166 --> 10:58.967
HIS DUMB FACE SMIRKIN',

10:59.033 --> 11:00.333
BECAUSE HIS BEARD LOOKS LIKE

11:00.400 --> 11:05.166
A MERKIN.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.300
BUT, LOOK, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

11:06.367 --> 11:06.867
MANDATE, BECAUSE NEITHER THE

11:06.934 --> 11:07.500
PRESIDENCY NOR THE SENATE ARE AS

11:07.567 --> 11:08.567
REFLECTIVE OF THE WILL OF THE

11:08.633 --> 11:09.767
AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THEY'RE

11:09.834 --> 11:10.900
SUGGESTING THERE.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.500
FIRST, TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.200
A DEMOCRAT HAS WON THE NATIONAL

11:14.266 --> 11:16.133
POPULAR VOTE IN FOUR OUT OF THE

11:16.200 --> 11:18.166
LAST FIVE ELECTIONS, BUT WE HAVE

11:18.233 --> 11:20.000
SPENT 12 OF THE LAST 20 YEARS

11:20.066 --> 11:21.900
WITH A REPUBLICAN IN OFFICE, AND

11:21.967 --> 11:23.500
THAT IS BECAUSE THE ELECTORAL

11:23.567 --> 11:24.967
COLLEGE, WITH ITS

11:25.033 --> 11:26.133
WINNER-TAKE-ALL APPROACH IN MOST

11:26.200 --> 11:27.467
STATES, CAN DISTORT THE WILL OF

11:27.533 --> 11:29.500
THE MAJORITY, ON TOP OF WHICH IT

11:29.567 --> 11:30.667
GRANTS DISPROPORTIONATE POWER TO

11:30.734 --> 11:32.800
LESS POPULOUS STATES, WHICH TEND

11:32.867 --> 11:34.533
TO BE RURAL AND MORE

11:34.600 --> 11:35.767
CONSERVATIVE, SOMETHING WHICH IS

11:35.834 --> 11:37.266
EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE

11:37.333 --> 11:38.333
SENATE, WHERE THERE ARE

11:38.400 --> 11:40.100
15 STATES REPRESENTING

11:40.166 --> 11:42.133
38 MILLION PEOPLE THAT HAVE

11:42.200 --> 11:43.900
30 REPUBLICAN SENATORS, EVEN

11:43.967 --> 11:45.667
THOUGH THAT IS LESS THAN THE

11:45.734 --> 11:47.033
TOTAL POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA,

11:47.100 --> 11:48.667
WHICH HAS JUST TWO DEMOCRATIC

11:48.734 --> 11:51.033
ONES.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.066
AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU EVEN

11:52.133 --> 11:53.300
GET INTO THE FACT THAT

11:53.367 --> 11:54.433
PLACES LIKE PUERTO RICO AND

11:54.500 --> 11:55.633
WASHINGTON D.C. -- WHERE THE

11:55.700 --> 11:56.667
POPULATIONS ARE LARGELY BLACK

11:56.734 --> 11:57.834
OR HISPANIC -- DON'T HAVE

11:57.900 --> 11:58.967
REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE AT

11:59.033 --> 12:00.133
ALL.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.867
IN FACT, IF YOU TAKE ALL THIS

12:01.934 --> 12:03.300
TOGETHER, THE SENATE GIVES THE

12:03.367 --> 12:04.834
AVERAGE BLACK AMERICAN ONLY 75%

12:04.900 --> 12:06.333
AS MUCH REPRESENTATION AS THE

12:06.400 --> 12:07.567
AVERAGE WHITE AMERICAN AND THE

12:07.633 --> 12:09.033
AVERAGE HISPANIC AMERICAN ONLY

12:09.100 --> 12:11.300
55% AS MUCH.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.066
AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT GREAT WHEN

12:13.133 --> 12:14.500
THE BEST THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT

12:14.567 --> 12:15.900
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY

12:15.967 --> 12:19.800
IS, "HEY, AT LEAST BLACK PEOPLE

12:19.867 --> 12:21.400
GOT ABOVE THREE FIFTHS THIS

12:21.467 --> 12:22.100
TIME.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.133
AT THIS RATE, THEY COULD COUNT

12:23.200 --> 12:23.834
AS 100% OF A WHITE PERSON AS

12:23.900 --> 12:24.533
EARLY AS 2408.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.367
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS,

12:25.433 --> 12:31.533
BLACK PEOPLE!

12:31.600 --> 12:32.166
YOU TRULY ARE AN INSPIRATION TO

12:32.233 --> 12:33.533
HISPANIC HALF-PEOPLE

12:33.600 --> 12:34.367
EVERYWHERE."

12:34.433 --> 12:35.233
SO THE FACT IS, WHEN BARRETT IS

12:35.300 --> 12:36.500
CONFIRMED, A PRESIDENT WHO LOST

12:36.567 --> 12:37.200
THE POPULAR VOTE WILL HAVE

12:37.266 --> 12:38.166
PICKED A QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL

12:38.233 --> 12:39.333
JUDICIARY AND A THIRD OF THE

12:39.400 --> 12:41.133
SUPREME COURT, AND HIS CHOICES

12:41.200 --> 12:42.667
WILL HAVE BEEN RUBBER-STAMPED BY

12:42.734 --> 12:44.467
A SENATE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY

12:44.533 --> 12:46.233
REPRESENTING 15 MILLION FEWER

12:46.300 --> 12:48.300
PEOPLE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC

12:48.367 --> 12:49.600
"MINORITY," AND THOSE COURTS

12:49.667 --> 12:55.767
HAVE ALLOWED REPUBLICANS TO SET

12:55.834 --> 12:57.400
WILDLY UNPOPULAR POLICY THAT

12:57.467 --> 12:58.533
WOULDN'T ACTUALLY PASS MUSTER

12:58.600 --> 13:01.300
WITH VOTERS.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.800
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

13:02.867 --> 13:04.100
QUESTION OF, WHAT CAN NOW BE

13:04.166 --> 13:05.133
DONE?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.533
WELL, FOR DEMOCRATS, THE FIRST

13:07.600 --> 13:08.400
PRIORITY IS TO TRY AND TAKE

13:08.467 --> 13:09.600
CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND

13:09.667 --> 13:10.266
BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS THIS

13:10.333 --> 13:11.433
NOVEMBER, WHICH, GIVEN

13:11.500 --> 13:12.834
EVERYTHING WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED,

13:12.900 --> 13:15.033
IS BY NO MEANS A CERTAINTY.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.500
NOT ONLY COULD TRUMP WIN THE

13:17.567 --> 13:18.367
ELECTION OUTRIGHT, EVEN IF HE

13:18.433 --> 13:19.400
DOESN'T, HE COULD, AS HE'S

13:19.467 --> 13:21.033
REPEATEDLY INDICATED, REFUSE TO

13:21.100 --> 13:22.266
CONCEDE AND FORCE THE RESULT

13:22.333 --> 13:24.400
INTO THE COURTS.

13:24.467 --> 13:25.900
AND THAT POSSIBILITY IS CLEARLY

13:25.967 --> 13:26.533
PART OF HIS HASTE TO GET A

13:26.600 --> 13:28.000
JUSTICE CONFIRMED BEFORE THE

13:28.066 --> 13:31.433
ELECTION.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.100
BECAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN TRYING TO

13:34.166 --> 13:35.133
HIDE IT NOW.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.333
WE NEED NINE JUSTICES.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.367
YOU NEED THAT.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.467
WITH THE UNSOLICITED MILLIONS OF

13:40.533 --> 13:41.967
BALLOTS THAT THEY'RE SENDING,

13:42.033 --> 13:43.000
IT'S A SCAM, IT'S A HOAX,

13:43.066 --> 13:46.900
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.367
AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT BETTER

13:48.433 --> 13:48.934
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.600
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED NINE

13:49.667 --> 13:50.233
JUSTICES UP THERE.

13:50.300 --> 13:50.967
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

13:51.033 --> 13:54.066
IMPORTANT.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.567
John: OKAY.

13:56.633 --> 13:57.233
THERE IS A NUMBER OF

13:57.300 --> 13:57.734
DARK INSINUATIONS THERE,

13:57.800 --> 13:58.533
INCLUDING, "IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

13:58.600 --> 13:59.166
US TO CHOOSE THE NEXT JUSTICE SO

13:59.233 --> 14:00.533
THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT THE

14:00.600 --> 14:02.467
AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOSE."

14:02.533 --> 14:03.700
AND THAT MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR

14:03.767 --> 14:04.600
THAT, FOR TRUMP, HAVING AN

14:04.667 --> 14:05.967
ADDITIONAL SUPREME COURT

14:06.033 --> 14:07.300
APPOINTMENT IS ABSOLUTELY

14:07.367 --> 14:09.266
CRUCIAL TO HIS RE-ELECTION --

14:09.333 --> 14:10.367
AS CRUCIAL, SAY, AS ANGRY WHITE

14:10.433 --> 14:11.767
PEOPLE WEARING RED HATS,

14:11.834 --> 14:12.700
FACEBOOK POSTS FROM UNDERCOVER

14:12.767 --> 14:14.233
RUSSIAN OPERATIVES, AND, BASED

14:14.300 --> 14:15.834
ON HIS CAMPAIGN'S ONLINE STORE,

14:15.900 --> 14:17.233
SELLING TRUMP COLORING BOOKS

14:17.300 --> 14:18.066
THAT EVEN THE KIDS IN THE AD

14:18.133 --> 14:19.533
LOOK BORED BY.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.834
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

14:22.900 --> 14:24.200
THE YOUNGER KID ISN'T EVEN

14:24.266 --> 14:25.100
PAYING ATTENTION, AND THE OLDER

14:25.166 --> 14:25.934
ONE LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO

14:26.000 --> 14:26.767
WILL THE COLORING BOOK INTO

14:26.834 --> 14:28.433
BECOMING A NINTENDO SWITCH WITH

14:28.500 --> 14:33.767
HIS EYES.

14:33.834 --> 14:34.433
ALSO, WHY AREN'T THEY

14:34.500 --> 14:35.133
COLORING IN THE COLORING BOOK?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.033
THE FATHER SEEMS TO BE READING

14:36.100 --> 14:36.767
IT TO HIS CHILDREN, WHICH IS

14:36.834 --> 14:37.967
OBJECTIVELY THE ONE WRONG WAY TO

14:38.033 --> 14:42.533
ENJOY A COLORING BOOK.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.667
BUT LOO, LET'S SAY, FOR THE SAKE

14:44.734 --> 14:46.000
OF ARGUMENT, DEMOCRATS DO MANAGE

14:46.066 --> 14:46.633
TO SWEEP THE UPCOMING ELECTION.

14:46.700 --> 14:47.500
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WOULD BE TO

14:47.567 --> 14:49.133
THINK THAT THAT HAS, IN ITSELF,

14:49.200 --> 14:50.700
FIXED EVERYTHING -- OR, INDEED,

14:50.767 --> 14:52.500
ANYTHING -- BECAUSE THERE'S NO

14:52.567 --> 14:53.734
POINT GETTING POWER UNLESS YOU

14:53.800 --> 14:55.000
ARE THEN WILLING TO BE BOLD

14:55.066 --> 14:56.200
ENOUGH TO USE IT TO MAKE

14:56.266 --> 14:58.633
SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGE.

14:58.700 --> 14:59.867
WE'VE ARGUED BEFORE THAT THE

14:59.934 --> 15:01.233
FILIBUSTER SHOULD BE ABOLISHED.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.166
THAT WOULD ALLOW LEGISLATION TO

15:02.233 --> 15:03.000
GET PASSED WITH A SIMPLE

15:03.066 --> 15:06.266
MAJORITY.

15:06.333 --> 15:06.967
IT IS ADMITTEDLY RISKY,

15:07.033 --> 15:08.033
ESPECIALLY FOR A PARTY THAT,

15:08.100 --> 15:08.734
AGAIN, FOR STRUCTURAL REASONS,

15:08.800 --> 15:09.934
CAN EXPECT TO BE IN THE MINORITY

15:10.000 --> 15:11.967
MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.834
BUT THOSE VERY FACTORS MAKE IT

15:13.900 --> 15:15.133
EXTREMELY HARD FOR DEMOCRATS TO

15:15.200 --> 15:16.133
WIN A FILIBUSTER-PROOF

15:16.200 --> 15:18.266
SUPERMAJORITY AND DO ANYTHING

15:18.333 --> 15:22.800
MEANINGFUL.

15:22.867 --> 15:23.734
WHAT IS FRUSTRATING IS THAT SOME

15:23.800 --> 15:24.233
CENTRIST DEMOCRATS, LIKE

15:24.300 --> 15:25.266
JOE MANCHIN, HONESTLY SEEM TO

15:25.333 --> 15:28.333
THINK THAT, EVEN IF THEY GET

15:28.400 --> 15:29.734
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POWER, THE

15:29.800 --> 15:31.000
BEST WAY FORWARD IS TO TRY AND

15:31.066 --> 15:32.100
RETURN TO A MORE CIVILIZED,

15:32.166 --> 15:32.867
MODERATE ERA IN AMERICAN

15:32.934 --> 15:35.333
POLITICS.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.066
I WILL MAKE EVERY DECISION

15:39.133 --> 15:40.033
I CAN THAT KEEPS THE SENATE

15:40.100 --> 15:40.734
BIPARTISAN.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.133
SIMPLE AS THAT.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.133
WE HAVE GOT TO FIGHT FOR

15:44.200 --> 15:44.700
BASICALLY WHO WE ARE AS A

15:44.767 --> 15:45.233
SENATE.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.700
CAN WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN A

15:46.767 --> 15:47.066
BIPARTISAN WAY?

15:47.133 --> 15:48.300
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.633
John: OH, I'VE GOT AN ANSWER

15:49.700 --> 15:50.433
TO THAT QUESTION FOR YOU, JOE:

15:50.500 --> 15:51.433
NO.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.667
YOU CAN'T.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.066
IT SEEMS THE MESSAGE MANCHIN

15:54.133 --> 15:56.066
WOULD TAKE FROM AMERICA SURGING

15:56.133 --> 15:57.467
TO THE LEFT, AGAINST THE ODDS,

15:57.533 --> 15:58.567
WOULD BE "I THINK THEY WANT US

15:58.633 --> 16:02.900
TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS."

16:02.967 --> 16:04.600
AND THAT IS NOT JUST DUMB,

16:04.667 --> 16:06.066
THAT'S DUMB ON THE LEVEL OF

16:06.133 --> 16:07.133
JAMES CAMERON GOING, "YOU KNOW

16:07.200 --> 16:07.600
WHAT PEOPLE WANT?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.333
FOUR MORE 'AVATAR' MOVIES."

16:08.400 --> 16:09.333
AND TO BOTH OF THOSE MEN, I SAY

16:09.400 --> 16:09.934
THIS: NO ONE WANTS THAT, STOP

16:10.000 --> 16:10.734
TALKING ABOUT IT, AND JUST GIVE

16:10.800 --> 16:12.834
US WHAT WE WANT:

16:12.900 --> 16:13.834
ONE MORE GOOD "TERMINATOR" MOVIE

16:13.900 --> 16:14.934
AND A GREEN NEW DEAL.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.834
I DON'T CARE WHICH OF YOU DOES

16:15.900 --> 16:17.133
WHICH, JUST GET IT THE FUCK

16:17.200 --> 16:19.300
DONE.

16:19.367 --> 16:20.800
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, EVEN IF THE

16:20.867 --> 16:22.867
DEMOCRATS SWEEP THE ELECTION,

16:22.934 --> 16:24.867
AND EVEN IF THEY THEN GET RID OF

16:24.934 --> 16:25.600
THE FILIBUSTER AND THEN HAVE THE

16:25.667 --> 16:26.834
COURAGE TO PASS MAJOR

16:26.900 --> 16:28.500
LEGISLATION, THOSE LAWS ARE NOW

16:28.567 --> 16:29.800
INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO A

16:29.867 --> 16:30.967
MORE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT

16:31.033 --> 16:33.266
STRIKING THEM DOWN.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.533
AND THAT HAS LED SOME TO SUGGEST

16:34.600 --> 16:35.700
TAKING THE MORE DRAMATIC STEP OF

16:35.767 --> 16:37.567
EXPANDING THE SUPREME COURT BY

16:37.633 --> 16:39.066
ADDING JUSTICES.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.467
IT'S POSSIBLE.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.800
THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SPECIFY

16:41.867 --> 16:43.333
HOW MANY SEATS THERE SHOULD BE,

16:43.400 --> 16:44.934
AND IT CAN AND HAS BEEN DONE IN

16:45.000 --> 16:46.700
THE PAST THROUGH A SIMPLE ACT OF

16:46.767 --> 16:47.900
CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

16:47.967 --> 16:49.233
REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE

16:49.300 --> 16:51.000
EVENTUAL BLOWBACK TO THAT WOULD

16:51.066 --> 16:55.100
BE.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.433
BECAUES IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS

16:56.500 --> 16:57.734
TO IMAGINE WHAT REPUBLICANS

16:57.800 --> 16:59.066
WOULD DO NEXT TIME THEY TOOK

16:59.133 --> 17:01.734
CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.300
SERIOUSLY, IT DOESN'T TAKE A

17:02.367 --> 17:02.834
GENIUS.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.467
THEY WANNA PACK THE COURT --

17:03.533 --> 17:04.133
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

17:04.200 --> 17:05.032
THEY WANNA PUT ON A LOT OF

17:05.099 --> 17:05.767
JUSTICES.

17:05.834 --> 17:06.367
THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE JUST

17:06.433 --> 17:07.333
HORRIBLE.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.200
I GUESS WE COULD DO THAT TOO,

17:08.266 --> 17:09.032
RIGHT?

17:09.099 --> 17:10.233
WE COULD DO THAT TOO.

17:10.300 --> 17:10.900
John: YEAH.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.099
HE'S RIGHT.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.233
HE COULD ABSOLUTELY DO THAT,

17:13.300 --> 17:14.934
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY CHILLING.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.133
EXPANDING THE COURT IS A BIT

17:16.200 --> 17:17.666
LIKE DOING YOGA NAKED --

17:17.733 --> 17:18.900
ONE WAY TO DAMPEN YOUR

17:18.967 --> 17:20.066
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA IS TO

17:20.133 --> 17:21.266
PICTURE DONALD TRUMP DOING IT

17:21.333 --> 17:23.099
TOO.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.532
COURT EXPANSION COULD OPEN THE

17:24.599 --> 17:26.532
DOOR TO A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE OF

17:26.599 --> 17:27.400
BOTH PARTIES DOING IT, WHICH

17:27.467 --> 17:29.000
COULD PERMANENTLY DESTABILIZE

17:29.066 --> 17:30.400
ONE OF THE BEDROCK INSTITUTIONS

17:30.467 --> 17:32.000
OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.033
NOW, DOES THAT OUTWEIGH THE

17:33.100 --> 17:34.734
POTENTIAL FOR A COURT WITH

17:34.800 --> 17:35.767
BARRETT ON IT UNDOING OR

17:35.834 --> 17:36.934
BLOCKING YEARS OF PROTECTIONS

17:37.000 --> 17:39.834
FOR OUR CLIMATE, HEALTH CARE,

17:39.900 --> 17:42.567
AND CIVIL AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS?

17:42.633 --> 17:43.100
THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTH

17:43.166 --> 17:43.700
CONSIDERING.

17:43.767 --> 17:44.567
NOTHING SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY

17:44.633 --> 17:45.600
HERE -- THOUGH I WILL SAY, THERE

17:45.667 --> 17:46.700
ARE SOME OTHER STEPS WE COULD

17:46.767 --> 17:47.633
TAKE THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

17:47.700 --> 17:48.734
TO ARGUE WITH AT THIS POINT,

17:48.800 --> 17:49.667
STEPS THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH THE

17:49.734 --> 17:50.700
SENATE AND WHITE HOUSE MORE

17:50.767 --> 17:51.734
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

17:51.800 --> 17:53.166
ELECTORATE.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.300
ON THE SENATE SIDE, YOU

17:54.367 --> 17:56.100
COULD GRANT STATEHOOD TO

17:56.166 --> 17:57.567
WASHINGTON D.C. AND, IF VOTERS

17:57.633 --> 17:59.000
THERE WANT IT, PUERTO RICO.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.400
THAT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP BALANCE

18:00.467 --> 18:06.600
OUT THE SENATE'S PRO-WHITE,

18:06.667 --> 18:09.367
-- BIAS TOWARD WHITE, RURAL

18:09.433 --> 18:09.600
VOTERS,

18:09.667 --> 18:10.100
IT'S ALSO THE

18:10.166 --> 18:10.700
RIGHT FUCKING THING TO DO FOR

18:10.767 --> 18:11.300
THE ALMOST 4 MILLION AMERICANS

18:11.367 --> 18:11.934
WHO CURRENTLY HAVE NO SENATORIAL

18:12.000 --> 18:14.266
REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER, WHICH

18:14.333 --> 18:14.800
IS JUST ASTONISHING.

18:14.867 --> 18:15.900
IT'S ROUGHLY THE POPULATION OF

18:15.967 --> 18:16.567
RHODE ISLAND, MAINE, MONTANA,

18:16.633 --> 18:19.467
AND WYOMING COMBINED.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.900
NOW, AS FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WE

18:20.967 --> 18:21.600
HAVE TO GET RID OF THE ELECTORAL

18:21.667 --> 18:22.800
COLLEGE, WHICH MIGHT SOUND

18:22.867 --> 18:23.533
RADICAL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.834
IT'S NOT EVEN A NEW IDEA.

18:26.900 --> 18:27.800
IN FACT, IN THE LATE '60s, IT

18:27.867 --> 18:29.700
VERY NEARLY HAPPENED.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.967
HERE'S BIRCH BAYH, THE SENATOR

18:31.033 --> 18:32.066
WHO SPEARHEADED THOSE EFFORTS,

18:32.133 --> 18:33.667
MAKING WHAT IS, IN RETROSPECT, A

18:33.734 --> 18:36.500
PRETTY CONVINCING CASE:

18:36.567 --> 18:38.633
THERE IS A GREAT DANGER WITH

18:38.700 --> 18:41.066
THE PRESENT ELECTORAL COLLEGE

18:41.133 --> 18:41.967
SYSTEM OF ELECTING A MINORITY,

18:42.033 --> 18:43.500
OR A NON-PLURALITY, PRESIDENT,

18:43.567 --> 18:45.066
OF ELECTING A PRESIDENT WHO HAS

18:45.133 --> 18:46.066
FEWER VOTES THAN THE FELLA HE'S

18:46.133 --> 18:47.266
RUNNING AGAINST.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.133
WHEN WE HAVE AN ELECTORAL

18:49.200 --> 18:50.800
COLLEGE SYSTEM WHICH THREATENS

18:50.867 --> 18:52.166
TO ELECT A MAN WHO HAS FEWER

18:52.233 --> 18:53.900
VOTES THAN HIS OPPONENT, WE TEND

18:53.967 --> 18:55.400
TO ERODE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE

18:55.467 --> 18:56.867
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THEIR

18:56.934 --> 18:57.967
PRESIDENT AND IN THEIR FORM OF

18:58.033 --> 18:59.133
GOVERNMENT.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.266
John: RIGHT.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.900
AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED

19:01.967 --> 19:04.433
THROUGH THE EXACT HYPOTHETICAL

19:04.500 --> 19:06.100
HE JUST DESCRIBED, AND TWICE, I

19:06.166 --> 19:07.166
CAN REPORT THAT OUR CONFIDENCE

19:07.233 --> 19:08.700
IN GOVERNMENT HASN'T SO MUCH

19:08.767 --> 19:09.967
BEEN ERODED -- EROSION IS A

19:10.033 --> 19:10.934
SLOW, DIGNIFIED PROCESS -- AS

19:11.000 --> 19:12.133
MUCH AS IT'S BEEN HIT BY AN

19:12.200 --> 19:13.633
ASTEROID FULL OF SENTIENT

19:13.700 --> 19:14.934
NUCLEAR JACKHAMMERS UNTIL IT

19:15.000 --> 19:15.934
COLLAPSED IN ON ITSELF LIKE A

19:16.000 --> 19:18.166
STAR INSIDE A BLACK HOLE.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.367
BACK THEN, THE IDEA OF

19:19.433 --> 19:20.500
ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

19:20.567 --> 19:22.300
HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.033
THEN-PRESIDENT NIXON EVEN URGED

19:24.100 --> 19:25.800
CONGRESS TO GO THROUGH WITH IT,

19:25.867 --> 19:27.633
WRITING "EVERY FOUR YEARS, THE

19:27.700 --> 19:29.166
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY PLACES A

19:29.233 --> 19:30.400
LARGE, UNACCEPTABLE, AND

19:30.467 --> 19:31.600
UNNECESSARY WAGER THAT THE

19:31.667 --> 19:32.934
ELECTORAL COLLEGE WILL WORK ONE

19:33.000 --> 19:34.934
MORE TIME."

19:35.000 --> 19:36.300
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE, BECAUSE

19:36.367 --> 19:37.934
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE KNOW

19:38.000 --> 19:39.133
NIXON WAS NOT A FAN OF, IT'S

19:39.200 --> 19:41.033
LEAVING ELECTIONS UP TO CHANCE.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.166
AND IF THERE ARE SIX THINGS WE

19:42.233 --> 19:43.066
KNOW HE WASN'T A FAN OF, IT'S

19:43.133 --> 19:44.667
JEWS, BLACKS, HIPPIES, SNITCHES,

19:44.734 --> 19:46.166
LIVING VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, AND

19:46.233 --> 19:47.400
THEN LEAVING ELECTIONS UP TO

19:47.467 --> 19:49.000
CHANCE.

19:49.066 --> 19:53.600
MISS YOU, DICK.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.500
BUT OBVIOUSLY, WE DIDN'T END UP

19:54.567 --> 19:55.367
DOING AWAY WITH THE ELECTORAL

19:55.433 --> 19:56.133
COLLEGE IN 1970, BECAUSE THE

19:56.200 --> 19:57.033
LEGISLATION WAS ULTIMATELY

19:57.100 --> 19:58.734
BLOCKED BY, YOU GUESSED IT, A

19:58.800 --> 20:04.300
FUCKING FILIBUSTER.

20:04.367 --> 20:05.700
AND EVEN TODAY, THE IDEA HAS

20:05.767 --> 20:09.867
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT, WITH 61% OF

20:09.934 --> 20:12.066
AMERICANS SAYING WE SHOULD

20:12.133 --> 20:13.033
ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.367
BUT REPUBLICANS WILL FIERCELY

20:14.433 --> 20:15.100
DEFEND IT.

20:15.166 --> 20:15.934
IN FACT, WHEN A MOVEMENT TO

20:16.000 --> 20:16.633
SWITCH TO A NATIONAL POPULAR

20:16.700 --> 20:17.300
VOTE BEGAN PICKING UP STEAM A

20:17.367 --> 20:17.934
DECADE AGO, MITCH McCONNELL SAID

20:18.000 --> 20:18.767
REPUBLICANS NEED TO "KILL IT IN

20:18.834 --> 20:21.567
THE CRADLE BEFORE IT GROWS UP."

20:21.633 --> 20:22.934
BUT THE BEAUTY IS, THE MOVEMENT

20:23.000 --> 20:24.133
McCONNELL WAS TALKING ABOUT

20:24.200 --> 20:25.400
THERE DOESN'T NECESSARILY

20:25.467 --> 20:26.467
REQUIRE HIS COOPERATION --

20:26.533 --> 20:28.734
OR, INDEED, AN ACT OF CONGRESS

20:28.800 --> 20:30.367
AT ALL -- BECAUSE A GROUP OF

20:30.433 --> 20:31.467
STATES HAVE QUIETLY SIGNED ONTO

20:31.533 --> 20:35.066
AN INTERESTING WORKAROUND.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.767
RECENTLY, 15 STATES AND THE

20:36.834 --> 20:38.734
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JOINED THE

20:38.800 --> 20:40.066
NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE

20:40.133 --> 20:41.967
COMPACT.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.700
THEY'RE PLEDGING TO GIVE THEIR

20:43.767 --> 20:44.700
ELECTORAL VOTES TO THE CANDIDATE

20:44.767 --> 20:45.767
WHO WINS THE NATIONAL POPULAR

20:45.834 --> 20:46.900
VOTE RATHER THAN THE PERSON WHO

20:46.967 --> 20:50.000
WINS THE POPULAR VOTE IN THEIR

20:50.066 --> 20:50.333
STATE.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.033
BUT THIS WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL

20:52.100 --> 20:53.367
ENOUGH STATES ADOPT IT WHICH, SO

20:53.433 --> 20:55.467
FAR, HASN'T HAPPENED.

20:55.533 --> 20:56.533
John: YEAH, IT'S KIND OF

20:56.600 --> 20:58.200
AMAZING.

20:58.266 --> 20:59.900
VERY BASICALLY, IF ENOUGH STATES

20:59.967 --> 21:01.600
JUST PRETEND THE ELECTORAL

21:01.667 --> 21:02.734
COLLEGE DOESN'T EXIST, IT COULD

21:02.800 --> 21:04.100
FUNCTIONALLY DISAPPEAR.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.467
IT'S THE SAME APPROACH EVERY

21:05.533 --> 21:06.600
"HARRY POTTER" FAN IS CURRENTLY

21:06.667 --> 21:07.500
TRYING TO TAKE TOWARD

21:07.567 --> 21:10.967
J.K. ROWLING.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.000
OBLIVIATE.

21:13.066 --> 21:14.233
YOU GO, THE BOOKS STAY.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.066
NOW, FOR THIS IDEA TO TAKE

21:15.133 --> 21:15.900
EFFECT -- SETTING ASIDE THE

21:15.967 --> 21:17.000
LEGAL HURDLES IT WOULD ALMOST

21:17.066 --> 21:18.000
CERTAINLY FACE -- IT WOULD

21:18.066 --> 21:19.433
NEED STATES REPRESENTING

21:19.500 --> 21:23.100
270 ELECTORAL VOTES TO SIGN ON.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.333
IT CURRENTLY HAS 196, WHICH IS A

21:24.400 --> 21:26.800
LOT, BUT NEEDS 74 MORE, WHICH

21:26.867 --> 21:29.834
WOULD BE INCREASINGLY HARD TO

21:29.900 --> 21:30.734
GET.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.166
AND OBVIOUSLY, THE BETTER WAY TO

21:32.233 --> 21:32.967
ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

21:33.033 --> 21:34.033
WOULD BE TO DO IT THROUGH A

21:34.100 --> 21:34.800
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, BUT

21:34.867 --> 21:38.467
THAT IS EVEN HARDER.

21:38.533 --> 21:39.500
AND I WILL SAY,

21:39.567 --> 21:40.333
THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS FOR

21:40.400 --> 21:42.567
SIGNIFICANT REFORM, SUCH AS

21:42.633 --> 21:43.934
SETTING TERM LIMITS FOR

21:44.000 --> 21:45.200
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, WHICH

21:45.266 --> 21:45.800
WE'VE ARGUED BEFORE WE SHOULD

21:45.867 --> 21:48.233
ABSOLUTELY DO.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.767
THE POINT HERE IS, IT'S PAST

21:49.834 --> 21:50.667
TIME FOR BIG CHANGE.

21:50.734 --> 21:51.567
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHY

21:51.633 --> 21:52.800
REPUBLICANS LIKE KEVIN McCARTHY

21:52.867 --> 21:55.967
ALREADY SEEM TO BE FREAKING OUT.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.667
THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IT HAS

21:57.734 --> 21:58.633
TO BE THEIR WAY OR NO WAY, BUT

21:58.700 --> 22:00.567
NOW IT'S A NEW EXTREME.

22:00.633 --> 22:01.500
THEY WANT TO EXPAND THE

22:01.567 --> 22:02.333
COURT.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.233
THEY WANT TO BRING NEW STATES

22:03.300 --> 22:04.500
INTO THE UNION.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.934
ANYTHING THAT RIGS THE SYSTEM ON

22:06.000 --> 22:07.400
THEIR BEHALF INSTEAD OF

22:07.467 --> 22:10.066
BELIEVING IN THE RULE OF LAW.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.734
John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

22:11.800 --> 22:16.166
FUCK YOU, KEVIN.

22:16.233 --> 22:16.867
IF THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE

22:16.934 --> 22:17.500
WHO DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

22:17.567 --> 22:18.266
THEIR OPPONENTS GOING TO

22:18.333 --> 22:19.467
EXTREMES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT,

22:19.533 --> 22:20.467
ITS CONGRESSIONAL FUCKING

22:20.533 --> 22:21.900
REPUBLICANS, AND SECONDLY, WE'VE

22:21.967 --> 22:23.367
EXPANDED THE COURT BEFORE AND

22:23.433 --> 22:25.300
WE'VE ADDED STATES BEFORE.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.734
WE ADDED TWO STATES IN 1959.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.967
WE DIDN'T FIGHT WORLD WAR II

22:29.033 --> 22:30.967
WITH 50 STARS ON THE FLAG.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.867
AMERICA IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING,

22:32.934 --> 22:34.667
AND GRANTING D.C. AND

22:34.734 --> 22:36.066
PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD OR ENDING

22:36.133 --> 22:37.600
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WOULD

22:37.667 --> 22:39.200
ACTUALLY MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE

22:39.266 --> 22:41.133
DEMOCRATIC RATHER THAN LESS,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.800
BECAUSE THE UNAVOIDABLE TRUTH

22:42.867 --> 22:43.967
HERE IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS

22:44.033 --> 22:46.100
ALREADY RIGGED.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.367
AND IT'S RIGGED IN A WAY THAT

22:47.433 --> 22:49.266
HAS ALLOWED A PARTY WITHOUT

22:49.333 --> 22:50.333
POPULAR SUPPORT TO DRASTICALLY

22:50.400 --> 22:51.467
RESHAPE AN ENTIRE BRANCH OF

22:51.533 --> 22:52.533
GOVERNMENT FOR THE FORESEEABLE

22:52.600 --> 22:55.567
FUTURE BY APPEALING ALMOST

22:55.633 --> 22:56.734
EXCLUSIVELY TO WHITE VOTERS IN

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
SOME OF THE LEAST POPULOUS

22:57.867 --> 23:02.133
REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.133
THAT'S NOT A MANDATE, AND IT'S

23:03.200 --> 23:04.700
NOT DEMOCRACY.

23:04.767 --> 23:06.266
IT'S A FUCKING TRAVESTY.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.500
WE ARE AT END OF A GENERATIONAL

23:07.567 --> 23:08.400
BATTLE, AND THE HEARTBREAKING

23:08.467 --> 23:10.133
THING IS, WE LOST.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.200
AND THAT HURTS.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.233
IT'S GOING TO HURT FOR A LONG

23:13.300 --> 23:14.333
TIME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WAYS

23:14.400 --> 23:15.834
THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE TO FULLY

23:15.900 --> 23:18.467
COMPREHEND.

23:18.533 --> 23:19.834
BUT THE NEXT BATTLE HAS TO START

23:19.900 --> 23:22.233
RIGHT NOW.

23:22.300 --> 23:22.900
AND IT WILL BE LONG.

23:22.967 --> 23:23.700
WE DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT,

23:23.767 --> 23:24.600
AND WE WON'T GET OUT OF HERE

23:24.667 --> 23:25.900
OVERNIGHT, BUT WE MUST BE

23:25.967 --> 23:27.433
WILLING TO FIGHT TIRELESSLY AND

23:27.500 --> 23:28.734
WITH EVERY TOOL AND TACTIC AT

23:28.800 --> 23:30.133
OUR DISPOSAL, BECAUSE SOMETIMES,

23:30.200 --> 23:31.567
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE ISN'T

23:31.633 --> 23:33.500
ENOUGH.

23:33.567 --> 23:34.867
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT MULE PISS WITH

23:34.934 --> 23:36.934
MULE PISS.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.133
AND NOW THIS.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.433
Announcer: AND NOW, AN

23:45.500 --> 23:46.000
UNEXPECTED UPDATE REGARDING

23:46.066 --> 23:46.200
PEEPS.

23:46.266 --> 23:49.567
A MAJOR CHANGE FOR ONE CANDY

23:49.633 --> 23:50.467
COMPANY, JUST BONE QUALITY

23:50.533 --> 23:52.000
CONFECTIONS HAS ANNOUNCED IT

23:52.066 --> 23:53.967
WON'T BE PRODUCING ITS POPULAR

23:54.033 --> 23:55.834
PEEPS FOR HALLOWEEN, CHRISTMAS,

23:55.900 --> 23:57.800
OR VALENTINE'S DAY.

23:57.867 --> 23:58.166
VALENTINE'S DAY.

23:58.233 --> 23:58.967
VICTORY!

23:59.033 --> 24:03.633
THE PEEPS HAS BEEN PURGED FROM A

24:03.700 --> 24:04.200
HOLIDAY-THEMED GIFT BASKETS.

24:04.266 --> 24:06.667
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE THEM

24:06.734 --> 24:10.400
FOR HALLOWEEN OR CHRISTMAS.

24:10.467 --> 24:14.333
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE

24:14.400 --> 24:17.033
HALLOWEEN PEEPS EITHER, BUT YOU

24:17.100 --> 24:17.633
NEVER STOP LEARNING.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.667
PEEPS WILL NOT BE IN

24:19.734 --> 24:21.800
HALLOWEEN CANDY BASKETS THIS

24:21.867 --> 24:22.567
YEAR, THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCES

24:22.633 --> 24:24.266
THEM SAID THEY WILL BE IN STARS

24:24.333 --> 24:26.000
FOR CHRISTMAS EITHER.

24:26.066 --> 24:26.200
DARN.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.400
NO, NOT DON, WHATEVER THE

24:28.467 --> 24:32.467
OPPOSITE OF "DARN" IS.

24:32.533 --> 24:34.066
EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS I

24:34.133 --> 24:36.000
CONVINCE MYSELF TO TRY TO PEEP

24:36.066 --> 24:37.633
BECAUSE I LOVE MARSHMALLOWS, AND

24:37.700 --> 24:38.633
EVERY TIME I'M MAD.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.667
I DON'T EVEN TRY THEM

24:41.734 --> 24:41.900
ANYMORE.

24:41.967 --> 24:46.633
DON'T EVEN TRY THEM!

24:46.700 --> 24:48.033
THE END OF PEEPS SHALL BE THE

24:48.100 --> 24:48.900
ONE TO DEVOUR YOU.

24:48.967 --> 24:50.967
PRODUCTION STOPPED IN SPRING

24:51.033 --> 24:52.400
WITH LIMITED PRODUCTION RESUMING

24:52.467 --> 24:54.133
IN MID-MAY, HOWEVER, THE CANDY

24:54.200 --> 24:56.867
IS SET TO RESUME NEXT YEAR JUST

24:56.934 --> 24:59.133
IN TIME FOR EASTER.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.400
NO!

25:01.467 --> 25:07.133
NO, NO, NO, FUCK, NO!

25:07.200 --> 25:07.734
NO!

25:07.800 --> 25:08.600
John: MOVING ON.

25:08.667 --> 25:09.400
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK WORD ON

25:09.467 --> 25:09.967
THE CENSUS.

25:10.033 --> 25:11.266
YOU MAY REMEMBER WE COVERED IT

25:11.333 --> 25:12.700
LAST YEAR WHEN WE LEARNED

25:12.767 --> 25:13.500
DONALD TRUMP THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN

25:13.567 --> 25:14.100
YOU COUNT HOW MANY TOILETS ARE

25:14.166 --> 25:17.333
IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.600
WHICH, Y'KNOW...

25:18.667 --> 25:19.033
IT ISN'T.

25:19.100 --> 25:19.767
THE CENSUS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT

25:19.834 --> 25:20.300
DETERMINES THINGS LIKE THE

25:20.367 --> 25:21.233
NUMBER OF SEATS EACH STATE HAS

25:21.300 --> 25:21.934
IN THE HOUSE AND THE

25:22.000 --> 25:28.867
DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS,

25:28.934 --> 25:32.367
AND GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE

25:32.433 --> 25:33.633
JUST TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THE

25:33.700 --> 25:35.000
SHOW ABOUT UNDERREPRESENTATION,

25:35.066 --> 25:35.700
IT COULDN'T BE MORE IMPORTANT

25:35.767 --> 25:36.400
FOR PEOPLE TO FILL IT IN.

25:36.467 --> 25:36.900
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE

25:36.967 --> 25:37.567
PANDEMIC, IT'S BECOME A BIT OF A

25:37.633 --> 25:38.166
CLUSTERFUCK, WITH THE LATEST

25:38.233 --> 25:38.734
NEWS COMING JUST THIS WEEK:

25:38.800 --> 25:39.200
ALL RIGHT, BREAKING

25:39.266 --> 25:39.734
OVERNIGHT: A FEDERAL COURT

25:39.800 --> 25:40.467
ORDERING THE TRUMP

25:40.533 --> 25:41.734
ADMINISTRATION TO DROP PLANS TO

25:41.800 --> 25:43.233
RUSH THE CENSUS TO A CONCLUSION

25:43.300 --> 25:44.300
AND EXTENDING COUNTING IN THE

25:44.367 --> 25:46.133
CENSUS FOR AN ADDITIONAL MONTH.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.633
NOW, THE CENSUS RESULTS

25:47.700 --> 25:49.266
DETERMINE FUTURE CONGRESSIONAL

25:49.333 --> 25:50.200
DISTRICTING AND HOW FEDERAL

25:50.266 --> 25:51.600
FUNDING IS DIVVIED UP ACROSS THE

25:51.667 --> 25:53.333
COUNTRY.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.133
COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS

25:55.200 --> 25:56.233
HAD ORDERED THE CENSUS BUREAU TO

25:56.300 --> 25:57.834
FINISH COUNTING BY SEPTEMBER

25:57.900 --> 25:58.900
30TH, ONE MONTH EARLIER THAN

25:58.967 --> 26:00.633
ORIGINALLY PLANNED.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.133
THE RULING IS EXPECTED TO BE

26:02.200 --> 26:02.700
APPEALED.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.800
John: YEAH.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.500
THE DEADLINE FOR THE CENSUS WAS

26:06.567 --> 26:07.967
INITIALLY JULY 31, THEN IT WAS

26:08.033 --> 26:10.000
PUSHED BACK TO OCTOBER 31, THEN

26:10.066 --> 26:11.734
POINTLESSLY MOVED FORWARD TO

26:11.800 --> 26:13.033
SEPTEMBER 30, WHICH IS IN JUST

26:13.100 --> 26:14.433
THREE DAYS, AND NOW THE COURTS

26:14.500 --> 26:15.633
WILL DECIDE WHETHER THAT'S

26:15.700 --> 26:17.500
ACTUALLY THE DEADLINE OR NOT.

26:17.567 --> 26:18.500
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE

26:18.567 --> 26:20.667
DEADLINE IS, IT'S SOON.

26:20.734 --> 26:23.233
AND CURRENTLY, ESTIMATES ARE

26:23.300 --> 26:24.667
THAT AROUND 14 MILLION

26:24.734 --> 26:25.533
HOUSEHOLDS HAVEN'T PARTICIPATED.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.633
BASICALLY, THE CENSUS IS

26:26.700 --> 26:27.700
SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD DO,

26:27.767 --> 26:29.266
BUT SOME OF US AREN'T, PUTTING

26:29.333 --> 26:30.433

26:31.300 --> 26:32.433
GETTING GINGIVITIS, YOU'RE

26:32.500 --> 26:33.133
GETTING UNDERREPRESENTED IN

26:33.200 --> 26:34.633
CONGRESS.

26:34.700 --> 26:35.667

26:35.734 --> 26:37.200
PEOPLE WHO HASN'T FILLED IT OUT

26:37.266 --> 26:38.200

27:32.400 --> 27:34.100

27:34.166 --> 27:35.233
PRESIDENT CHARACTER REFERRED TO

27:35.300 --> 27:36.600
ONLY AS "MR. LANDLORD," AND IT

27:36.667 --> 27:37.600
CONTAINS LINES LIKE

27:37.667 --> 27:39.133
"EFFERVESCENCE LIVED IN HER
