00:01.819 --> 00:03.719
Previously on "11.22.63"...

00:03.719 --> 00:06.739
The point is, if I see
Oswald shoot at Walker

00:06.740 --> 00:09.384
- and I know that he's alone...
- Kill him, and that saves Kennedy.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.729
Could you save someone
else too? My sister Clara.

00:11.730 --> 00:13.749
If you can go to other
times, bring her back.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.762
I can only go back to 1960.

00:15.763 --> 00:17.278
That's how it works. I'm sorry.

00:17.279 --> 00:19.279
Right underneath, it makes
things a lot easier.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.269
They still have no idea who we are.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.200
Let's keep it that way.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.249
People will want to know
that I stand for something.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.600
Ready?

00:32.290 --> 00:34.349
George is the gun, he's the bullet.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.407
- CIA's pulling the trigger.
- What do we do now?

00:37.944 --> 00:41.052
I'm here because I love
everything about you.

00:41.053 --> 00:43.032
You are a wonder.

00:43.033 --> 00:47.116
Now, I don't think that we
have been formally introduced.

00:47.117 --> 00:50.231
- I'm Sadie's husband.
- Why don't you give her the divorce

00:50.232 --> 00:52.271
and then crawl back under your rock?

00:52.272 --> 00:54.471
You two deserve each other.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.055
Jake, are you here?

01:02.840 --> 01:05.447
- Sadie...
- Who are you?

01:12.212 --> 01:14.011
Ohh, Lee.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.596
Sadie?

01:21.212 --> 01:26.141
Sadie! Sadie, please!

01:26.142 --> 01:27.473
Sadie.

01:27.475 --> 01:29.281
Hey, are you all right?

01:29.282 --> 01:31.032
- Sadie? Sadie.
- Don't touch me!

01:31.034 --> 01:32.336
Sadie, Sadie, please...

01:32.338 --> 01:34.141
- Don't touch me!
- Sadie,

01:34.142 --> 01:36.231
can we just go inside and talk?

01:36.232 --> 01:37.681
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:37.683 --> 01:39.251
Let go.

01:39.252 --> 01:41.171
- It's not what you think.
- What did I just hear

01:41.172 --> 01:43.231
on a tape in your basement?

01:43.232 --> 01:44.842
What was that?

01:44.843 --> 01:46.265
A drama, okay.

01:46.267 --> 01:48.298
Those are actors, Russian actors.

01:50.212 --> 01:52.462
Everything you say is a lie.

01:55.272 --> 01:58.328
Look at me, and say it again.

02:03.619 --> 02:05.260
- You can't.
- Maybe...

02:05.261 --> 02:07.261
All I want from you is honesty.

02:07.262 --> 02:09.211
Maybe I can't tell you because
I'm trying to protect you.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.589
I don't need protecting from you.

02:13.102 --> 02:16.264
Makes me sick that you can look
at me and lie to me like that.

02:20.102 --> 02:22.121
- Stay away from me.
- Sadie...

02:22.122 --> 02:23.827
Stay away from me, Jake!

03:56.152 --> 03:58.191
Odysseus is offered eternal life

03:58.192 --> 04:01.565
with the nymph Calypso, but he declines.

04:02.172 --> 04:05.971
Now, why do we think he would
choose to remain mortal?

04:12.192 --> 04:14.794
All right. Put your books down.

04:15.212 --> 04:16.766
Forget "The Odyssey."

04:17.232 --> 04:19.714
Pretend you can go back in time.

04:20.796 --> 04:24.181
You go back in time, and you
can change one thing...

04:24.182 --> 04:27.622
One thing to alter history.

04:27.624 --> 04:28.926
What would you do?

04:28.928 --> 04:30.261
How would we travel back in time?

04:30.262 --> 04:32.161
Doesn't matter. You have a time machine.

04:32.162 --> 04:34.783
Bang, you're there. Now what do you do?

04:34.784 --> 04:36.221
But are you talking about time travel

04:36.222 --> 04:39.201
that actually utilizes
electromagnetic energy,

04:39.202 --> 04:42.433
- or is it a magical...
- Glenn, it doesn't matter, okay?

04:42.434 --> 04:44.260
The point is, you're there.

04:44.261 --> 04:47.786
I'm looking for something
that will help humanity,

04:47.787 --> 04:49.433
help the world. What would you do?

04:49.434 --> 04:51.432
- Kill Hitler.
- Kill Hitler, okay.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.251
No, kill Saddam Hussein.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.181
- You'd kill Hussein over Hitler?
- How about we go to 1930

04:56.182 --> 04:58.191
when Hitler and Stalin
met and kill them both?

04:58.192 --> 05:01.141
- Hitler and Stalin never met.
- Okay, lots of killing going on.

05:01.142 --> 05:03.251
Or we could go back and kill Homer

05:03.252 --> 05:05.111
so we wouldn't have to
read this dumb book.

05:05.112 --> 05:06.518
Yeah, just kill Homer, dude.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.168
Yeah, which wouldn't
be hard. He's blind.

05:10.242 --> 05:12.443
God damn it, Jake.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.658
You were in a Dallas whorehouse.

05:15.659 --> 05:17.814
Then you've got some
kind of recording setup

05:17.815 --> 05:19.250
with some Russian filth.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.745
I don't really give a damn what
your side of the story is.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.483
Contract you signed has
a moral clause in it.

05:28.102 --> 05:29.998
You're not the man I thought you were.

05:31.643 --> 05:33.338
So, I'm fired?

05:33.978 --> 05:37.170
It'll be easier for you to get
another job if you resign.

05:37.171 --> 05:41.141
Deke, I'm the same guy that
walked through that door

05:41.142 --> 05:43.059
every day for the past two years.

05:44.142 --> 05:46.656
I-I got Mike Coslow to act.

05:47.202 --> 05:49.281
I got Jim LaDue to memorize poetry,

05:49.282 --> 05:51.181
Yates for Christ's sake.

05:51.182 --> 05:52.967
Doesn't that count for anything?

05:52.968 --> 05:54.822
It's why I've let you talk this long.

05:57.004 --> 05:59.868
- I thought we were friends.
- We were.

06:02.014 --> 06:04.022
And I wish things had
worked out differently.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.060
Okay.

06:11.428 --> 06:13.052
I've got somewhere else to be.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.973
Well, you better get there then.

06:14.974 --> 06:17.024
Ms. Mimi's got your
termination papers ready.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.903
He said you have a form for me to sign?

06:22.905 --> 06:24.235
Yes, sir.

06:25.279 --> 06:26.992
I'm sorry, sir. I thought I had it.

06:26.993 --> 06:29.083
I can't... I can't
find the correct form.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.573
It's okay, Ms. Mimi, just mail it to me.

06:33.897 --> 06:35.217
Good-bye.

06:36.343 --> 06:37.840
Maybe it's for the best.

06:37.841 --> 06:40.083
No, sir. I don't believe that.

06:42.124 --> 06:43.557
Thank you.

06:47.769 --> 06:50.813
Did you see Oswald shoot at Walker?

06:50.814 --> 06:52.506
No. I...

06:53.419 --> 06:58.073
I lasted till December 3, 1962.

06:58.074 --> 07:02.473
If I had seen Oswald shoot that gun

07:03.353 --> 07:06.573
alone with my own two eyes,

07:08.297 --> 07:10.521
I would have taken the fucker out

07:10.522 --> 07:12.392
and know it would've made a difference.

07:14.419 --> 07:16.821
There it is, General Walker's.

07:17.403 --> 07:20.135
Tomorrow someone takes a shot at him.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.910
So all we got to do is see
if Lee was really alone.

07:24.501 --> 07:27.042
Didn't we hear George tell
him to do it for the CIA?

07:27.043 --> 07:29.680
Yeah, but sometimes I think

07:30.315 --> 07:33.173
Lee's a patsy caught in a conspiracy.

07:33.592 --> 07:36.311
Sometimes I think he's
just a lone crazy man.

07:37.994 --> 07:40.498
The real litmus test
is if he's here alone

07:40.499 --> 07:42.144
with that gun tomorrow night.

07:44.044 --> 07:46.079
What's with the upside-down flags?

07:47.094 --> 07:50.193
You went to that rally.
Walker's a fucking sociopath.

07:50.582 --> 07:52.776
A so... Socio-what?

07:53.491 --> 07:54.887
He's crazy.

07:55.658 --> 07:57.863
Is it bad I'm rooting
for Lee to hit the guy?

07:59.124 --> 08:01.083
Come on.

08:13.204 --> 08:14.846
All right.

08:16.094 --> 08:21.504
So, 9:00 tomorrow night
is when it goes down.

08:22.295 --> 08:24.516
There's a church service
that gets out around then.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.847
Right over there.

08:29.084 --> 08:32.102
Theory is, Lee planned it

08:32.104 --> 08:35.371
so that he could disappear
into the crowd, all right?

08:36.183 --> 08:39.153
9:00, Walker's there at his desk.

08:39.842 --> 08:44.024
According to history, the bullet
goes through that window.

08:46.074 --> 08:47.711
It's a pretty easy shot.

08:48.124 --> 08:51.127
Yeah, except Lee misses.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.345
Walker gets some shrapnel
in the arm, that's it.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.023
So, if you're gonna shoot someone

08:59.024 --> 09:00.542
through that window, where would you be?

09:01.692 --> 09:03.642
- And we're here.
- Yeah.

09:04.094 --> 09:06.013
So tomorrow, we're gonna
have to find a spot

09:06.014 --> 09:07.954
where we can watch and not be seen.

09:08.984 --> 09:12.595
But even if Oswald's here alone
to kill General Walker,

09:13.778 --> 09:16.544
how's that prove he's gonna
kill Kennedy in six months?

09:17.232 --> 09:19.062
Because he's using the same fucking gun

09:19.063 --> 09:21.828
with the same fucking bullets
that blows Kennedy's head off!

09:21.829 --> 09:24.212
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but doesn't
General Walker hate JFK?

09:25.034 --> 09:27.003
Why would Lee try to kill both of them?

09:27.004 --> 09:30.993
I don't know, Bill. It doesn't
matter why he shoots.

09:30.994 --> 09:33.880
All that matters is if he shoots.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.152
Jake?

09:36.154 --> 09:39.154
Come on, come on. Let's go.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.739
Whee!

09:57.993 --> 10:01.252
You need to stop speaking
Russian to the child, honestly.

10:01.254 --> 10:02.714
Oh!

10:02.716 --> 10:04.043
Here you go.

10:04.044 --> 10:06.023
Junie doesn't need to have
other children thinking

10:06.024 --> 10:09.063
that she comes from a country
that wants to kill us.

10:09.064 --> 10:11.093
But Lee wants June speak both.

10:11.094 --> 10:14.143
She can learn Russian when
she's older if she wants to.

10:14.144 --> 10:15.973
- Bill?
- But right now,

10:15.974 --> 10:18.253
- she needs to learn...
- Get over here.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.022
She's tough.

10:21.023 --> 10:23.103
Marguerite never lets up on Marina.

10:23.104 --> 10:25.063
Have you checked the
spares on both cars?

10:25.064 --> 10:27.133
- Mm-hmm.
- What about the sparkplugs?

10:27.134 --> 10:29.043
The sparkplugs?

10:29.044 --> 10:31.522
Bill, we're going up against the past.

10:31.523 --> 10:33.626
Tomorrow anything can
happen, and it will.

10:33.627 --> 10:35.053
All we can do is try and be ready.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.073
That means check everything...

10:37.074 --> 10:39.183
Batteries in the flashlights,
extra car battery,

10:39.184 --> 10:42.449
tools in case we get
a flat tire, everything.

10:43.325 --> 10:45.830
- Diapers?
- Trust me.

10:47.054 --> 10:49.715
Everything's fine, okay?

10:49.716 --> 10:52.140
- We're good to go.
- Okay.

10:54.114 --> 10:57.592
After tomorrow, what happens then?

10:59.184 --> 11:02.973
Well, I guess I kill Oswald,

11:02.974 --> 11:06.646
anyone involved, and hope
I don't get arrested.

11:07.587 --> 11:09.092
You haven't talked much about how

11:09.093 --> 11:10.481
you're gonna do that part.

11:11.014 --> 11:13.173
Well, maybe I don't
want to think about it.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.917
So?

11:17.630 --> 11:19.143
Look, we can talk about
that later, okay?

11:19.144 --> 11:22.093
If we pull this off,
which I think we can,

11:22.094 --> 11:23.684
I'm gonna go back to Maine,

11:23.685 --> 11:25.102
I'm gonna go into the rabbit hole,

11:25.103 --> 11:26.432
come out the other side,

11:26.433 --> 11:30.072
see what America in 2015 looks like,

11:30.073 --> 11:32.422
and hope we made it better.

11:33.204 --> 11:34.920
What about me?

11:36.054 --> 11:37.562
Do I come with you?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.103
Oh.

11:46.690 --> 11:48.052
I'll leave you Al's book.

11:48.053 --> 11:51.605
You can... you can make the rest
of the bets and buy a house.

11:52.632 --> 11:54.706
What happens tomorrow if you get caught?

11:59.559 --> 12:01.005
We're not gonna get caught.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.575
I'm gonna fill these up.

12:19.204 --> 12:21.123
Whew.

12:21.124 --> 12:24.013
All right, so if George shows up...

12:24.014 --> 12:25.839
I follow George. You stay with Lee.

12:25.841 --> 12:27.225
Yeah.

12:27.227 --> 12:29.053
All right, now.

12:29.054 --> 12:32.113
Here, you take this
till I see you, okay?

12:32.114 --> 12:35.423
I got to go back to Jodie.
I'm gonna sweep the house.

12:35.424 --> 12:38.563
Jake Amberson the teacher
needs to be erased.

12:38.564 --> 12:39.887
What about Sadie?

12:42.697 --> 12:44.764
I was fooling myself thinking
I could be with her.

12:45.994 --> 12:47.622
I came to the past for a reason, right?

12:48.668 --> 12:50.289
- Right.
- Okay.

12:51.034 --> 12:52.419
Today's the day.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.622
All right.

14:50.154 --> 14:52.656
- Hello?
- Hello, Jake.

14:53.094 --> 14:55.053
Do you know who this is?

14:58.565 --> 14:59.938
Johnny.

15:00.104 --> 15:04.023
I have been thinking a lot
about what you said to me,

15:04.024 --> 15:07.153
and I would like to, you know,
continue our little chat,

15:07.154 --> 15:09.133
so why don't you come over?

15:09.683 --> 15:11.033
Where are you?

15:11.034 --> 15:13.151
Oh, Jake.

15:14.561 --> 15:16.051
You know the address.

15:16.053 --> 15:19.002
You've shaken the bed frame here plenty.

15:19.512 --> 15:21.611
Jake, don't come!

15:21.612 --> 15:24.779
Johnny. Johnny!

15:27.064 --> 15:29.866
Johnny. Johnny!

15:36.994 --> 15:40.327
Hello? It's just you. I can't be there.

15:42.323 --> 15:43.734
What, Jake?

15:44.064 --> 15:46.761
Bill, forget the plan. I
can't make it to Walker's.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.739
You're gonna have to do this alone.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.415
What are you talking about?

15:51.327 --> 15:52.647
Jake?

16:20.985 --> 16:22.327
Jake?

16:23.124 --> 16:24.699
We're back here.

16:36.064 --> 16:39.023
There he is. You got here fast.

16:39.024 --> 16:40.522
Here.

16:41.104 --> 16:43.023
- Have a seat.
- Okay, okay.

16:43.024 --> 16:46.371
Just stop, please, all right,
we can all walk away.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.053
- We won't say anything.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:48.054 --> 16:50.063
- Please, we can work it out.
- Shh! Jake!

16:50.064 --> 16:53.554
Jake, I'm gonna be the one
doing the talking today, okay?

16:54.044 --> 16:57.203
You can speak up when
I ask you a question.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.103
That seems fair, right?

17:01.014 --> 17:04.012
Oh, no, no. No. Hands.

17:04.013 --> 17:05.355
Hands in your lap.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.183
Yeah, like a lady should.

17:08.184 --> 17:10.193
Yeah.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.434
You're curious to see what
she looks like, right?

17:23.003 --> 17:26.022
Jesus. Oh, Jesus Christ.

17:26.023 --> 17:29.993
Oh, oh, oh, Jake, I don't
remember asking you a question.

17:32.044 --> 17:34.175
She's not gonna be pretty anymore.

17:35.417 --> 17:38.133
Have you ever been married, Jake?

17:38.134 --> 17:40.183
- Yes.
- Yeah?

17:40.184 --> 17:44.757
Oh, well, then you know. Marriage.

17:44.758 --> 17:48.093
It's all about compromise, yeah?

17:48.094 --> 17:50.417
That's what makes a
healthy relationship.

17:51.064 --> 17:55.023
So when... when Sadie left,

17:55.024 --> 17:56.646
I thought that she could...

17:56.647 --> 17:59.132
She only needed some time
to sort things out, right?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.339
But when I finally found her,

18:05.510 --> 18:07.394
I noticed that something was different.

18:08.034 --> 18:09.733
Well, she had dirtied herself.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.013
Oh, yeah. Dirty little bird.

18:16.703 --> 18:20.224
But, you know, hey,
stains can be cleaned.

18:21.074 --> 18:23.624
Right? Or so I thought,

18:24.994 --> 18:29.159
until you told me what she told you.

18:30.974 --> 18:35.463
Personal details that should
stay between a man and his wife.

18:37.064 --> 18:41.023
So, you did this.

18:42.472 --> 18:44.202
You did this!

18:45.054 --> 18:47.203
Mr. Jacob Amberson cock boy!

18:47.204 --> 18:51.063
You turned my wife into
your dirty bird whore.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.113
Sticking your thing into her wormy hole!

18:54.114 --> 18:56.983
Please don't! Look...

18:56.984 --> 18:59.983
- We didn't have sex.
- If you are gonna lie to me, Jake,

18:59.984 --> 19:01.761
then I'm just not gonna
let you talk at all!

19:01.762 --> 19:03.596
I-I-I'm not.

19:03.597 --> 19:06.763
I listened to the rutting.

19:07.207 --> 19:11.247
Squealing, you're just like little pigs.

19:15.104 --> 19:18.213
Do you... do you love her?

19:19.856 --> 19:21.181
Yes.

19:22.064 --> 19:23.996
- Then kiss her.
- What?

19:24.994 --> 19:30.993
Stick your tongue into her
whore mouth, cock boy.

19:30.994 --> 19:32.665
No! Kiss her!

19:32.666 --> 19:34.147
Okay. All right.

19:40.984 --> 19:42.344
Get ready.

19:47.984 --> 19:51.083
Can I please just bandage her face?

19:51.084 --> 19:53.403
Oh, uh, no.

19:53.855 --> 19:56.442
No, don't you worry about that.
We're almost done.

19:56.443 --> 19:57.946
Here.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.143
- Have a drink.
- What is... What is that?

20:02.144 --> 20:05.023
Well, that there is Westover Bleach.

20:05.024 --> 20:08.043
That is the best darn
bleach that money can buy,

20:08.044 --> 20:10.624
and I should know, because
I sell it by the gallon.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.132
Every door I knock on ends up closing

20:13.133 --> 20:16.188
on a happy customer holding
a bottle of that bleach.

20:17.064 --> 20:19.083
Cuts through any stain.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.013
Makes your whites bright
as the day you bought 'em.

20:22.014 --> 20:24.942
No, even brighter.

20:26.094 --> 20:29.193
It cuts through anything.
You'll see, yeah.

20:29.194 --> 20:30.993
Yeah, take a sip.

20:30.994 --> 20:33.629
- I'm not gonna drink that.
- Oh, yes you are.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.596
Yes you are, cock boy.

20:36.004 --> 20:37.691
You'll drink that whole glass,

20:37.692 --> 20:43.202
because if you don't,
well, then Sadie dies.

20:43.203 --> 20:45.183
I'm sorry, Johnny.

20:45.184 --> 20:47.113
- It was an accident!
- No.

20:47.114 --> 20:49.993
You know how I like things.
You did that on purpose.

20:49.994 --> 20:51.457
Johnny, please don't.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.500
No! Sit down, Jake!

20:55.661 --> 20:59.152
There are bad people in this world,

20:59.153 --> 21:01.543
people who would seduce a man's wife,

21:01.544 --> 21:03.716
and someone has to do
something about it.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.828
I'm from a different morality,
product of another time.

21:07.829 --> 21:10.993
No one understands what I need
to do for the greater good.

21:15.084 --> 21:17.198
There's nothing funny here.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.285
Well, sure there is.

21:21.830 --> 21:25.095
All this because I told him
your dirty little secrets?

21:26.994 --> 21:30.974
Well, I didn't even tell him
about your grandmother.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.737
She liked to wash you, didn't she?

21:36.620 --> 21:38.861
She washed you real good.

21:40.389 --> 21:42.052
Sadie, Sadie, don't.

21:42.053 --> 21:44.650
How old were you? 12?

21:44.651 --> 21:46.083
- No, 13.
- No... don't...

21:46.084 --> 21:48.354
They took her away
because of you, Johnny.

21:48.355 --> 21:50.083
- No.
- Yes, they did, they took her

21:50.084 --> 21:51.993
- away because of you!
- Shut your mouth!

21:51.994 --> 21:53.409
- Shut your mouth, now!
- Yes, they did, Johnny!

21:53.411 --> 21:55.193
Shut your filthy mouth!

22:03.234 --> 22:04.541
Hi.

22:05.313 --> 22:06.672
Sorry to bother you.

22:14.194 --> 22:16.033
Lee's sleeping.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.285
I know. I mean, I figured.

22:22.004 --> 22:23.829
Bill, no, I-I can't.

22:23.830 --> 22:25.196
Sure you can.

22:25.730 --> 22:28.242
Come on. Take it.

22:29.277 --> 22:30.841
It's not gonna kill you.

22:34.338 --> 22:36.458
Come.

22:55.054 --> 22:56.502
What the hell happened to you?

22:56.503 --> 23:01.132
I-I tried to make a pie.

23:01.133 --> 23:04.822
My sister Clara, she used to make
strawberry pie for me when I was little.

23:05.994 --> 23:08.043
I'd eat so much, I got sick.

23:10.670 --> 23:13.130
So you have sister here in Texas?

23:15.004 --> 23:16.726
No. She died.

23:18.620 --> 23:19.988
I'm sorry.

23:36.566 --> 23:39.787
- You miss her?
- Yeah.

23:53.420 --> 23:54.982
Well, why don't you fold it?

23:58.727 --> 24:00.040
Who are you?

24:00.042 --> 24:03.083
I live downstairs. We're neighbors.

24:03.084 --> 24:05.033
I didn't mean to bother
you none, I just...

24:05.034 --> 24:08.775
I came up here to ask if you had ice?

24:08.776 --> 24:10.902
Our freezer's broke.

24:12.373 --> 24:13.732
Uh-huh.

24:15.164 --> 24:18.483
Well... see you.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.704
I hope I didn't wake you
up. I... not that...

24:22.897 --> 24:24.302
If you were sleeping.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.482
Have you ever read any Karl Marx?

24:30.034 --> 24:32.074
Can't say that I have, no.

24:41.478 --> 24:43.343
You read it, and then we'll talk.

24:44.404 --> 24:45.888
Is it any good?

24:47.844 --> 24:49.299
It tells the truth.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.164
Sh...

25:10.601 --> 25:13.203
Jake, be very careful.

25:16.024 --> 25:17.515
Mr. Amberson.

25:19.569 --> 25:21.624
Mike, Bobbi Jill.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.123
Ms. Dunhill won the spring raffle.

25:23.124 --> 25:26.043
We brought over her prize.
What are you doing here?

25:27.027 --> 25:30.722
What? I'm just... Um...

25:33.014 --> 25:35.535
I-I'm just fixing her sink.

25:36.054 --> 25:38.053
I can help. My dad's a plumber.

25:38.054 --> 25:41.163
No, that's okay. I got it. Um...

25:46.994 --> 25:50.416
Uh... she's not feeling well,
so you should just get out of here.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.203
You can leave the basket there.

25:52.204 --> 25:55.365
Call the police,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

25:57.408 --> 25:59.013
Would you please lock it?

26:04.054 --> 26:06.023
If I hear sirens, 'cause you just

26:06.024 --> 26:08.013
told those two kids to call the police,

26:08.014 --> 26:11.203
I am gonna cut off her nose
right in front of you.

26:11.204 --> 26:13.592
- I didn't.
- Well...

26:14.325 --> 26:15.727
that's good then, isn't it?

26:15.728 --> 26:19.169
Can we just... can we just...
Let's just finish this up.

26:19.891 --> 26:22.401
It's just a very simple drink.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.092
Either you drink that entire glass,

26:25.093 --> 26:27.408
or Sadie gets a bullet to the head.

26:27.409 --> 26:32.002
How do I know that you won't
kill her after I drink it?

26:32.003 --> 26:33.788
Because she's my wife.

26:34.753 --> 26:39.012
The vow is in sickness and in health,

26:39.013 --> 26:40.865
for richer, for poorer,

26:41.408 --> 26:44.365
till death us do part.

26:45.044 --> 26:49.288
You drink that, and she will live.

26:51.687 --> 26:55.656
Do it. Save her, Jake.

27:02.094 --> 27:04.684
And there's no cheatin'!

27:07.194 --> 27:09.429
Just drink.

27:12.190 --> 27:14.203
Aah! Aah!

27:19.074 --> 27:23.961
I tried to do this nice, you shits!

27:26.014 --> 27:27.993
Aah!

27:27.994 --> 27:32.064
Oh, you...

27:47.054 --> 27:49.054
I hear you.

27:50.194 --> 27:53.275
I smell you.

27:53.974 --> 27:57.457
Bellies on the ground, like vermin.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.053
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie.

28:29.054 --> 28:32.163
Sweetie, you okay? Sadie, Sadie?

28:48.104 --> 28:50.063
She's lost a lot of blood.

28:50.064 --> 28:52.093
Sadie, can you hear me?
You're gonna be okay.

28:52.094 --> 28:54.043
Shouldn't she have an IV?

28:54.044 --> 28:56.043
The nurses'll do that at the hospital.

28:56.044 --> 28:58.003
At the hospital?
Why don't you do it now?

28:58.004 --> 29:00.064
- Aren't you paramedics?
- Aren't we what?

29:01.144 --> 29:05.033
Look... Hey, talk to me.

29:05.034 --> 29:09.844
- Hey, where are you taking her?
- Go to Parkland Hospital in Dallas.

29:11.224 --> 29:13.462
Parkland, of course.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.176
Jake Amberson?

29:27.235 --> 29:30.112
Deputy Stephens. We need to talk.

29:30.113 --> 29:32.203
Look, I can't right now. I-I
need to get to the hospital.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.983
There's a dead man in there.

29:33.984 --> 29:35.615
I know, I killed him.

29:35.616 --> 29:37.123
It was self defense, okay?

29:37.142 --> 29:38.861
He was gonna kill her,
and he was gonna kill me.

29:38.863 --> 29:40.175
Self defense or no,
I'm gonna need to take

29:40.177 --> 29:41.858
- a statement from you right now.
- Sir, I can't right now.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.163
I need to be with her.

29:43.165 --> 29:44.471
You need to tell me
what happened in there.

29:44.473 --> 29:47.020
Dan Stephens. Is that you?

29:47.650 --> 29:49.202
I swear it seems like yesterday

29:49.203 --> 29:52.338
that you threw that Hail Mary
pass against the Panthers.

29:52.994 --> 29:55.373
Mr. Simmons, I'm in the middle
of an interrogation right now.

29:56.014 --> 29:57.871
Jake teaches at my school.

29:58.767 --> 30:01.143
I need to ask him my questions.
This is a murder scene.

30:01.144 --> 30:03.153
Well, you go solve the
goddamn murder then.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.502
Jake and I are gonna go to the hospital.

30:05.503 --> 30:06.834
You want to meet us there, you can ask

30:06.835 --> 30:08.215
all the questions you want.

30:09.094 --> 30:10.659
Don't leave the hospital.

30:11.428 --> 30:13.209
Let me ask you something.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.494
Did you kill that son of a bitch?

30:15.495 --> 30:17.610
- Yeah.
- Good.

30:24.034 --> 30:26.173
Lee?

30:26.174 --> 30:28.993
Lee?

30:28.994 --> 30:31.022
- What?
- Where are you going?

30:31.023 --> 30:33.023
To the library.

31:06.396 --> 31:08.013
You all here for Miss Sadie Dunhill?

31:08.014 --> 31:10.123
Yes. Is she okay?

31:10.124 --> 31:13.133
I'm Dr. Jones. She's
in surgery right now.

31:13.134 --> 31:14.492
How long?

31:15.014 --> 31:16.391
Well, it was a very deep cut,

31:16.392 --> 31:18.082
and she's lost a great deal of blood.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.645
It could be all night.

31:20.554 --> 31:23.098
Okay, but she's gonna be okay?

31:24.024 --> 31:26.162
It goes beyond cosmetic.

31:26.163 --> 31:28.090
She's in critical condition.

31:29.084 --> 31:30.417
Uh...

31:31.236 --> 31:33.102
I can't make any promises.

31:36.984 --> 31:38.317
Um...

31:38.551 --> 31:40.341
But we have our best surgeons on it.

31:41.054 --> 31:43.103
Well, we all want to donate blood.

31:43.104 --> 31:44.477
Yeah.

31:45.094 --> 31:48.663
All right, everybody who's
donating blood, y'all follow me.

31:49.423 --> 31:51.427
Right now, let's go.

31:56.712 --> 32:00.403
I understand Ms. Dunhill ended
her relationship with you?

32:01.044 --> 32:02.410
Yeah, she did.

32:02.796 --> 32:06.277
You two had an argument in front
of your house a couple days ago.

32:09.358 --> 32:11.392
I mean, did you... Did you see her face?

32:12.004 --> 32:16.003
There's got to be some
fingerprints on the knife.

32:16.004 --> 32:17.508
I mean, Jesus Christ.

32:17.509 --> 32:19.916
Look, I just want to get the truth.

32:20.510 --> 32:22.512
You give it to me straight,

32:22.513 --> 32:24.458
we can sort this whole thing out.

32:26.732 --> 32:28.229
We had an argument,

32:28.642 --> 32:32.321
and she broke up with me because
I kept things from her.

32:32.322 --> 32:33.644
That's the truth.

32:34.669 --> 32:36.042
She was open,

32:36.043 --> 32:39.041
and she trusted me, and...

32:40.359 --> 32:41.997
and I couldn't do that.

32:43.806 --> 32:45.231
And I don't deserve her.

32:47.177 --> 32:51.033
Then that crazy fucker came and cut her,

32:51.034 --> 32:53.229
and he tried to kill her and me both.

32:53.984 --> 32:55.425
So the truth is yeah,

32:55.427 --> 32:58.672
it felt fucking great
when I cracked his skull,

32:59.170 --> 33:00.754
because he deserved it,

33:01.651 --> 33:03.317
so you can put that in your book.

33:08.074 --> 33:09.440
No need.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.433
My prayers'll be with Ms. Dunhill.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.929
9:00 is when it goes down.

33:27.817 --> 33:30.241
There's a church service
that gets out around then.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.380
Where are you at, Lee?

34:41.984 --> 34:44.184
Good night, Clara.

34:48.184 --> 34:50.094
Clara.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.507
Clara?

34:59.211 --> 35:02.263
Clara? Clara!

35:03.074 --> 35:05.003
Clara!

35:05.004 --> 35:06.410
Clara?

35:09.617 --> 35:11.575
Clara? Clara?

35:14.004 --> 35:17.083
Oh. W... You... you were my sister.

35:17.084 --> 35:18.437
Excuse me?

35:19.174 --> 35:23.093
Uh, I thought... I thought
you were my sister.

35:23.094 --> 35:24.727
I'm sorry.

35:33.547 --> 35:36.370
The hardest part about
living in the past

35:37.376 --> 35:41.304
is that everything you tell
everybody will be a lie.

35:43.064 --> 35:46.071
It's possible to forget
who you really are,

35:48.034 --> 35:50.426
and you'll want to reach out,

35:51.285 --> 35:52.829
make a connection.

35:54.094 --> 35:55.848
I made that mistake.

35:57.144 --> 35:59.262
If you get too close,

36:00.343 --> 36:02.442
you forget what you came for.

36:38.054 --> 36:40.053
General Walker, please slow down.

36:40.054 --> 36:41.472
Please.

36:41.473 --> 36:43.132
If I could just get a
look at your arm...

36:43.133 --> 36:45.093
If it's a gunshot wound...

36:45.094 --> 36:47.103
If you can slow down so I
can get you a wheelchair...

36:47.104 --> 36:49.153
I don't need a wheelchair.
It's only damn shrapnel.

36:49.154 --> 36:51.113
- Sir?
- Tell 'em I'll be fine.

36:51.114 --> 36:54.023
Doesn't need it, but you
should let 'em check you.

36:54.024 --> 36:56.119
Fine. Just make it quick.

37:08.074 --> 37:10.467
- Hello?
- Hey.

37:11.074 --> 37:14.314
I-I saw Walker. He's at the hospital.

37:15.094 --> 37:16.432
What happened?

37:18.064 --> 37:19.535
Where were you?

37:19.984 --> 37:23.073
Bill, what happened at Walker's house?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.380
Was Lee there? Did... what'd you see?

37:26.054 --> 37:29.089
I... I missed it.

37:30.054 --> 37:33.625
- You missed it?
- I never saw Lee there at all.

37:34.706 --> 37:36.481
I missed everything.

37:42.104 --> 37:44.086
I saw my sister.

37:45.594 --> 37:48.407
Nobody ever found Clara's body,

37:49.054 --> 37:51.772
and so I hoped she was still alive,

37:52.359 --> 37:54.756
even though I knew
that that wasn't true.

37:57.054 --> 37:59.295
I saw Clara.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.209
She was there, and then she was gone.

38:07.074 --> 38:08.964
Then I heard the gun.

38:10.084 --> 38:12.676
I screwed up, Jake. I'm sorry.

38:13.904 --> 38:15.225
I'm s...

38:35.528 --> 38:37.053
Mr. Amberson?

38:37.054 --> 38:38.432
Has the nurse found you?

38:39.760 --> 38:41.103
No.

38:41.104 --> 38:43.627
I wanted to say how sorry I am.

38:44.287 --> 38:46.053
Sor... Sorry? W-w-why?

38:46.054 --> 38:48.103
I thought we'd be able to do much more.

38:48.104 --> 38:49.508
No, no, no.

38:49.510 --> 38:51.366
No, no. Please, no.

38:51.367 --> 38:53.093
No one at this hospital,
including myself,

38:53.094 --> 38:56.234
has encountered a facial
wound of that severity.

38:58.813 --> 39:00.637
I don't... I don't understand. What...

39:00.638 --> 39:03.022
What happened? Blood loss?

39:03.023 --> 39:05.395
We just don't have the
technology available.

39:06.014 --> 39:08.973
Sadie died because you
don't have the technology?

39:08.974 --> 39:11.073
Oh, my good God. No, she's not dead.

39:11.074 --> 39:12.797
- What?
- No, no, it's her scar.

39:12.798 --> 39:14.112
I'm talking about the scar on her face.

39:14.113 --> 39:16.634
It'll be severe. There
will be permanent damage,

39:16.635 --> 39:18.059
but she's not dead.

39:20.074 --> 39:22.306
Mr. Amberson, she'll be all right.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.036
Hey.

39:29.974 --> 39:33.226
You're alive. You're alive.

39:37.114 --> 39:41.083
Sorry. I don't want to hurt you.

39:41.084 --> 39:42.711
I'm sorry.

39:46.559 --> 39:49.880
If I look as bad as I
feel, I must be a sight.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.690
You've never looked better.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.983
You saved my life.

40:01.084 --> 40:02.501
No.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.666
You saved mine.

40:14.064 --> 40:16.061
I can't do this without you.

40:17.268 --> 40:18.630
Do what?

40:22.024 --> 40:23.467
I lied to you.

40:26.518 --> 40:28.426
And I'll never do it again.

40:35.134 --> 40:37.145
I have to tell you something.

40:39.094 --> 40:43.153
I-I know. I think I know.

40:43.563 --> 40:45.177
Just let me say it.

40:49.144 --> 40:50.969
I'm from the future.

40:52.677 --> 40:55.143
I was born in 1978.

40:57.004 --> 41:00.395
Don't. Don't make me laugh.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.968
You're not joking?

41:22.974 --> 41:24.649
You're from the future?

41:28.974 --> 41:31.484
That's not what I thought
you were gonna say.

41:39.422 --> 41:41.392
Are you really an English teacher?

41:44.994 --> 41:46.373
Yeah.

41:49.204 --> 41:51.029
Where are you really from?

41:53.014 --> 41:54.722
I'm from Lisbon, Maine.

41:55.682 --> 41:57.231
That part's true.

42:02.044 --> 42:03.436
Where are you from?

42:04.984 --> 42:07.280
I grew up in East Texas.

42:09.104 --> 42:10.688
Where'd you go to school?

42:12.054 --> 42:13.564
Vanderbilt.

42:15.094 --> 42:16.555
You?

42:16.556 --> 42:17.896
Bates.

42:18.962 --> 42:20.276
I love you.

42:21.649 --> 42:23.584
You don't think it's too soon for that?

42:23.585 --> 42:25.212
I mean, we just met.

42:26.688 --> 42:28.744
Well, it's good to meet you.

42:31.693 --> 42:33.492
It's not too soon for me.

42:36.630 --> 42:38.671
I love you too.

42:42.084 --> 42:45.164
Did you always know that you
wanted to be a librarian?

42:47.094 --> 42:49.319
Oh, I just like the books.

42:50.223 --> 42:51.535
What's your favorite?

42:52.064 --> 42:53.377
Let me guess.

42:54.432 --> 42:56.317
"From Here to Eternity."

42:56.445 --> 42:58.686
No, that's too savvy for me.
