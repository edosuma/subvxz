WEBVTT

01:14.000 --> 01:15.319
Langford.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.199
Langford.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.678
If only it hadn't been for Langford,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.511
how happy we might have been.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.313
Manwaring!

01:40.000 --> 01:43.834
Manwaring, don't turn
your back to me, please!

01:44.200 --> 01:46.191
- I can't bear it!
- Lady Susan!

01:46.320 --> 01:47.719
Frederica!

01:47.840 --> 01:50.070
Wait! I beg you!

02:51.240 --> 02:53.071
Catherine, a letter.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.755
It seems Lady Susan will finally visit.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.155
- In fact, she's already on her way.
- What?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.759
Lady Susan Vernon?

03:00.600 --> 03:05.116
Congratulations on being about to receive
the most accomplished flirt in all England.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.720
You misjudge her, Reginald.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.835
How so?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.753
Well, like many women
of beauty and distinction,

03:10.960 --> 03:14.270
our sister-in-law has been a victim
of the spirit of jealousy in our land.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.550
- It's jealousy?
- Yes.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.390
Like anyone, Susan might be
capable of an action

03:19.480 --> 03:21.914
or a remark which is
open to misconstruction,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.416
but I can't help but admire the fortitude

03:23.440 --> 03:26.034
with which she has supported
grave misfortune.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.591
Excuse me. I spoke out of turn.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.434
Why would Lady Susan, who was
so well-settled at Langford,

03:35.520 --> 03:37.317
suddenly want to visit us?

03:37.440 --> 03:39.271
What reason does she give?

03:39.360 --> 03:42.397
Her anxiety to meet me
and to "know the children."

03:42.480 --> 03:44.311
It's never concerned her before.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.713
Your Ladyship.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.355
Susan. Come, hurry.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.353
My dear, such haste. How curious you are.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.159
Mr. Johnson's carriage is
about to come into the street.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.311
Surely that must happen often?

04:23.040 --> 04:25.395
- You didn't receive my letter?
- Letter?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.836
Mr. Johnson forbids my seeing you.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.350
Well, that's preposterous.
By what means "forbids"?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.875
He threatened the severest
punishment imaginable,

04:34.040 --> 04:35.712
sending me back to Connecticut.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.070
To be tarred and feathered?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.628
He claims to have important business
at Hartford

04:40.880 --> 04:43.997
and threatens to settle there
if our connection isn't entirely severed.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.071
And for what possible reason or pretext?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.029
His former ward,
Lucy Manwaring, wrote to him.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.869
Did she?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.031
- A horrid woman.
- I know.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.630
Deranged. If she were going to be jealous,

05:02.720 --> 05:05.075
she should not have married
such a charming man.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.034
I recall thinking,
as I approached Langford,

05:09.040 --> 05:12.715
"I like this man.
Pray heaven no harm come of it."

05:13.280 --> 05:15.748
I was determined to be discreet,
and I have been.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.515
Admitting no one's attentions
but Manwaring's,

05:18.600 --> 05:21.034
avoiding general flirtation entirely,

05:21.120 --> 05:23.554
except for a little notice
bestowed on Sir James Martin.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.915
But if the world knew my motive there,
it would honor me.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.230
- Martin?
- Sir James Martin.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.270
Of Martindale. Vastly rich, rather simple.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.634
Ideal.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.876
Miss Maria Manwaring
has set her cap for him,

05:35.960 --> 05:38.315
considering such an income
too large not to be shared.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.873
But with a little notice,

05:39.960 --> 05:42.349
I detached him and soon
had him in love with Frederica.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.799
If my daughter were not
the greatest simpleton on Earth,

05:45.880 --> 05:47.871
- she would be engaged to him now.
- What?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.313
She refused him.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.388
A baronet with 10,000 a year.
It's all so provoking.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.799
But where will you live?

05:54.880 --> 05:58.839
If there were another place open to me,
I would crawl there on my knees.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.678
The worst spot this side of the ocean.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.352
A country village. Churchill.
My brother-in-law's seat.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.958
Mrs. Cross, a gentlewoman
in straitened circumstances,

06:08.080 --> 06:09.672
will come with me as my companion,

06:09.760 --> 06:13.753
to pack and unpack.
You know, that sort of thing.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.096
And as there's an element
of friendship involved,

06:16.120 --> 06:18.588
I'm sure the paying of wages
would be offensive to us both.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.870
My brother-in-law,
Charles Vernon, is very rich.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.040
Once a man gets his name
on a banking house,

06:29.120 --> 06:30.189
he rolls in money.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.955
So it's not very rational for his lady
to begrudge the sums he's advanced me.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.389
Decidedly irrational, not rational at all.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.675
I have no money and no husband.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.114
Though, in one's plight,
they say, is one's opportunity.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.948
Not that I would ever want
to think in opportunistic terms.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.235
Oh, certainly not. Never.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.556
Churchill coming into view, Your Ladyship.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.317
Heavens. What a bore.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.553
Yes. Decidedly boring.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.549
Charles.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.318
- Susan, welcome to Churchill.
- Exceptional reception.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.719
Mrs. Cross.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.536
Mrs. Cross, Charles Vernon.
Welcome to Churchill.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.358
- Charming. Yellow suits you.
- This is Frederic and Emily.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.598
Good afternoon, Frederic.
Very pleased to meet you.

07:41.880 --> 07:46.556
Mrs. Cross is a friend of Lady Susan
and should be in the adjoining room.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.318
No reason to complain
of Mr. Vernon's reception.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.595
I'm not entirely satisfied with his lady's.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.631
- No?
- No.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.473
She's perfectly well-bred, surprisingly so,

08:12.560 --> 08:15.711
but her manner doesn't persuade me
she was disposed in my favor.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.238
As you might have noticed,
I sought to be as amiable as possible.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.839
Exceptionally amiable.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.356
In fact, entirely charming.
Excuse me for saying so.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.073
Oh, not at all. It's true.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.550
I wanted her to be delighted with me,
but I didn't succeed.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.312
I can't understand it.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.995
It's true I've always detested her

08:36.080 --> 08:39.231
and that before her marriage,
I went to great lengths to prevent it.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.799
Yet, it shows an illiberal spirit

08:40.880 --> 08:43.188
to resent for long
a plan which didn't succeed.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.670
Decidedly illiberal. Not liberal at all.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.193
My opposing her marriage

08:48.280 --> 08:51.511
and then later preventing her and
Charles from buying Vernon Castle

08:51.600 --> 08:54.478
might have given her
an unfavorable impression of me.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.114
But I've noticed that where
there's a disposition to dislike,

08:57.240 --> 08:59.117
a pretext will soon be found.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.271
- You mustn't reproach yourself.
- I shan't.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.871
The past is done.
My project will be the children.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.552
I know a couple of their names already.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.677
And I've decided to attach myself
to young Frederic in particular.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.549
Taking him on my lap and sighing over him
for his dear uncle's sake.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.194
Come in.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.513
Mrs. Vernon's compliments, Your Ladyship.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.877
She asks if you and Mrs. Cross
would join her for tea.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.353
With pleasure.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.115
Mrs. Cross would prefer her repose,
but thank Mrs. Vernon.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.315
I'll join her directly.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.919
Yes, Frederic, I see
you have quite an appetite.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.896
You will grow tall and handsome,
like your uncle and father.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.296
Frederic, be good.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.235
Don't touch that.</font>

09:47.320 --> 09:48.594
Frederic, be careful!

09:48.680 --> 09:51.672
- Oh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
- No, not at all.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.518
Such a family resemblance.
Rather moves me.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.519
You'll want to change.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.194
No, no, let's have our tea
while it's still warm.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.077
Mrs. Cross is a genius with fabrics.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.151
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.673
How much Frederic reminds me
of his dear uncle.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.216
Do you think there's a resemblance?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.549
Oh, remarkable. The eyes.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.674
Weren't Frederic Vernon's eyes brown?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.993
Well, I refer more to the shape
and slope of the brow.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.200
Oh.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.432
I must thank you for this visit.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.478
I'm afraid the short notice
must have come as a surprise.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.478
Only because I understood you
to be so happily settled at Langford.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.154
It's true Lady Manwaring
and her husband

10:30.240 --> 10:31.468
made me feel very welcome,

10:31.560 --> 10:35.394
but their outgoing dispositions
led them so often into society.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.160
I might have tolerated
such a life at one time

10:38.280 --> 10:42.239
but the loss of a husband such as
Mr. Vernon cannot be borne easily.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.119
To stay with you, here,
at your charming retirement

10:47.200 --> 10:48.997
became my fondest wish.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.036
I was happy to have the chance to meet.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.038
Might I confide something?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.793
Langford was not ideal for my daughter.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.872
Her education has been neglected,
for which I fault myself.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.154
Mr. Vernon's illness prevented me
from giving her the attention

11:03.240 --> 11:05.800
that both duty and affection required.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.753
I've therefore placed her at this
excellent school Miss Summers keeps.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.550
I trust Frederica will visit soon.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.234
Well, a visit, as delightful
as that might be,

11:14.360 --> 11:18.592
would represent so many hours and days
deducted from the grand affair of education.

11:18.680 --> 11:22.559
And I'm afraid Frederica
can't afford such deductions.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.437
But she'll come for Christmas?

11:25.080 --> 11:30.074
Alas, no. Miss Summers can only give her the
concentrated attention she requires then.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.916
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.936
But if you'll excuse me,
I'll give it to Mrs. Cross,

11:34.960 --> 11:37.428
who, when rested, craves activity.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.558
Once she's applied her genius to it,

11:39.640 --> 11:42.837
all traces of little Frederic's
interesting design will disappear.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.636
The fees at Frederica's school
are far too high to even think of paying.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.236
So, in a sense, it's an economy.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.108
Yes, well-arrived with her friend
Mrs. Cross and upstairs resting.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.640
I confess to curiosity to know this lady,
see first-hand her bewitching powers.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.432
Is she as beautiful as they say?

12:22.520 --> 12:24.750
- You worry me, Reginald.
- Don't.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.833
I understand Lady Susan possesses
a degree of captivating deceit,

12:28.920 --> 12:32.117
- which might be pleasing to detect.
- You truly worry me.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.959
Good evening.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.789
What charming expressions.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.031
Susan, um, let me introduce my brother,
Reginald DeCourcy.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.277
Reginald, may I present
Frederic Vernon's widow, Lady Susan,

12:44.360 --> 12:46.351
and her friend, Mrs. Cross.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.154
Delighted to make your acquaintance.
Your renown precedes you.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.189
I'm afraid the allusion escapes me.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.352
Your reputation as
an ornament to our society.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.510
Oh, what you say surprises me.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.790
Since the great sadness
of my husband's death,

13:05.880 --> 13:07.871
I've lived in nearly perfect isolation.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.917
To better know his family
and to further remove myself from society,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.672
I came to Churchill.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.796
Not to make new acquaintances
of frivolous sort,

13:15.880 --> 13:19.077
but of course I'm pleased
to know my sister's relations.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.475
I take it you are finding
Mr. DeCourcy's society more pleasurable?

13:59.560 --> 14:00.879
To some degree.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.669
At first, his conversation
betrayed a sauciness and familiarity,

14:04.760 --> 14:05.795
which is my aversion.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.519
But since, I've found
a quality of callow idealism

14:08.600 --> 14:09.999
which rather interests me.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.831
When I've inspired him with greater respect
than his sister's kind offices have allowed,

14:14.920 --> 14:16.876
he might, in fact, be an agreeable flirt.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.672
He's handsome, isn't he?

14:18.760 --> 14:19.829
In a calf-like way.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.235
Not like Manwaring, of course, but...

14:22.320 --> 14:25.676
There's a certain pleasure in making
a person pre-determined to dislike

14:25.800 --> 14:27.916
instead acknowledge one's superiority.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.875
How delightful it will be

14:29.960 --> 14:32.520
to humble the pride
of these pompous DeCourcys.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.678
A letter for you, my dear.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.791
- Letter?
- Yes, from Catherine.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.477
I hope she'll arrive soon.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.913
The season's cheerless
without the children.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.953
Oh, I'm afraid this cold
has affected my eyes.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.270
Save your eyes, my dear. I'll read for you.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.191
- No, that's all right.
- No, I insist.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.439
Here, now.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.679
Let's see.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.149
Hmm...

15:19.920 --> 15:21.148
Catherine hopes you are well

15:21.240 --> 15:24.038
and asks most particularly
that you give me her love.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.510
- Yes, and?
- Um...

15:29.520 --> 15:33.069
Oh, Reginald has decided to stay
at Churchill to hunt with Charles.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.792
He cites the fine open weather.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.871
What nonsense. Weather's not open at all.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.600
Well, maybe it is there,
or it was when she wrote.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.033
My dear, could you just read?

15:41.880 --> 15:43.199
- Verbatim?
- Yes, the words.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.111
Some of Catherine's voice will be in them.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.910
I'll read every word, comma and dash
if that's what you wish. Here.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.756
"I grow deeply uneasy, comma,
my dearest Mother, comma,

15:53.880 --> 15:55.393
"about Reginald, comma,

15:55.520 --> 16:00.310
"from witnessing the very rapid increase
in her influence, semi-colon..."

16:00.400 --> 16:02.038
Just the words, please.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.516
No punctuation at all? All right.
That's much easier.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
Lady Susan?

16:14.160 --> 16:16.390
Yes, Lady Susan has been
visiting Churchill.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.238
- Lady Susan Vernon?
- Yes.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.548
Well, how could Reginald
engage in conversations

16:22.640 --> 16:24.039
with Lady Susan Vernon?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.473
Conversations which are...

16:29.360 --> 16:30.873
What would they talk about?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.696
My eyes have definitely cleared, I
can read it. Don't trouble yourself.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.056
No, no, no, if my son and heir
is involved with such a lady,

16:36.080 --> 16:37.479
I must trouble myself.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.515
Well, I must go.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.749
No! I'll write.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.035
No, no, no.
If this is happening, there's no time.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.951
- Afternoon, sir.
- Thank you.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.108
One, two...

17:17.119 --> 17:18.314
- Father.
- Afternoon.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.271
How extraordinary for you to be here.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.030
- You're in good health, I trust?
- Hmm.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.589
How's Mother?

17:26.119 --> 17:29.032
- What brings you to these parts?
- Take a seat.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.079
I won't dissemble and say
I have business in the district.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.276
What I've come about is more important.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.592
What's of such importance?

17:36.720 --> 17:40.235
I know young men don't admit
inquiry into affairs of the heart.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.392
But as the sole son of an ancient family,

17:44.200 --> 17:47.237
you must know that your conduct
is most important to us.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.719
Your happiness, ours,

17:48.800 --> 17:51.234
the credit of the family name,
its very survival...

17:51.320 --> 17:52.833
- Father...
- No, no, no, hear me out.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.515
I know that you'd not deliberately form
an engagement without informing us.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.037
But I can't help fear that you'll
fall into an obligation

18:02.200 --> 18:04.236
which everyone near you must oppose.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.389
What do you mean, sir?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.112
Well, Lady Susan Vernon's age alone...

18:07.200 --> 18:08.519
Father, you astonish me.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.589
What surprises you?

18:10.680 --> 18:13.069
Imputing such ambitions to Lady Susan.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.520
She'd never think of such a thing.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.394
My sole interest has been to enjoy
the lively conversation of a superior lady.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.355
- Catherine's prejudice is so great...
- Prejudice?

18:22.440 --> 18:26.672
Lady Susan's neglect of her late husband,
her extravagance and dissipation,

18:26.760 --> 18:28.800
her encouragement of other men,
were so notorious...

18:28.840 --> 18:30.398
These are vile calumnies.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.920
I could explain each
but would not so dignify them.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.516
I know you spend little time in society.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.696
- None.
- Should you have frequented it more,

18:41.720 --> 18:45.395
you'd know the astonishing degree
of vile, hateful jealousy in our country.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.636
Do not deprecate our country, sir.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.634
I can't prevent you inheriting
the family estate

18:53.720 --> 18:56.837
and my ability to distress you during
my life is not the kind of revenge

18:56.920 --> 18:58.148
that I would choose to take.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.520
- Father, this is unnecessary.
- No, no, let me continue.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.593
A permanent connection between
you and Lady Susan Vernon

19:06.400 --> 19:09.198
would destroy every comfort of our lives.

19:09.280 --> 19:15.071
It would be the death of the honest pride
with which we've always considered you.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.318
We'd blush to see you,
to hear of you, to think of you.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.469
Father.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.592
With the utmost humility,
let me say that what you imagine

19:26.120 --> 19:28.111
is impossible.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.576
Poor Mrs. Cross
was obliged to accept

19:45.600 --> 19:47.477
a paid position in Buckinghamshire.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.400
As there was an element
of friendship between us,

19:50.480 --> 19:53.392
I realized the paying of wages
would be offensive to us both.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.632
- You value friendship highly.
- Yes. I hope I was of some help to her.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.597
Your friends don't neglect you.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.832
Thank you, Charles.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.516
Oh, it's from Frederica's school.

20:15.880 --> 20:16.949
No.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.913
I can't believe it.
It defies comprehension.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.228
What?

20:22.320 --> 20:25.790
Frederica has run away.
She's run away from school.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.757
- Heavens. Where to?
- Oh!

20:27.880 --> 20:30.269
- They don't know.
- She's lost?

20:30.360 --> 20:34.069
No. They detected her plan
early enough to intercept her.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.056
Oh, folly, where could
she have thought of going?

20:36.080 --> 20:37.115
Surely here.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.350
No, this is the last place she would come.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.593
I mean, rather...

20:41.680 --> 20:43.477
But she must miss you terribly.

20:43.560 --> 20:47.030
Certainly. I just don't think
Churchill would be her object.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.075
Oh, now... This is outrageous.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.869
Miss Summers requires that
Frederica be removed from school.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.296
Miss Summers must be under the impression

20:55.320 --> 20:57.515
that as a widow without fortune,
I may be bullied.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.354
Evidently, she's forgotten
Frederica is a Vernon.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.157
Well, Charles must put this right.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.073
Confronted with his imposing worth,

21:05.200 --> 21:08.237
even the mistress of a school
must be persuaded to act rightly.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.713
I had no notion of Frederica
being so contrary,

21:21.880 --> 21:23.598
she seemed all Vernon milkiness.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.508
But it confirms the rightness of my plan.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.637
- Did Sir James call?
- Several times.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.153
Excellent.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.037
I followed your instructions,

21:32.120 --> 21:35.317
scolding him roundly for making love
to Maria Manwaring.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.955
He protested that it had only been in joke.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.548
You were right. He's wonderfully silly.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.518
But we must not let Sir James forget
with whom he's in love.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.273
A man so rich and foolish
will not remain single long.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.709
Sir James is so far from
having forgotten the Vernons,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.189
I'm sure he'd marry
either of you in an instant.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.597
I must go back to Churchill.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.317
But I may need your help finding a school
if Miss Summers won't take Frederica back.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.834
Under no circumstances
will I have Frederica at Churchill.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.148
That's wise.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.873
What do you mean?

22:04.560 --> 22:07.074
The nearness of their ages,
her and Reginald's.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.509
- Oh, how unkind.
- Forgive me.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.074
Forgiven. The fallacy of youth.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.835
Isn't it rather clear that it is we,
women of decision, who hold the trumps?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.793
Lady Susan? Lady Susan Vernon.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.793
- How dare you address me, sir?
- But Lady Susan...

22:23.920 --> 22:25.751
Be gone, sir! Or I will have you whipped.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.788
Outrageous! Have you never met him?

22:29.960 --> 22:32.758
No, I know him well. I would never
speak to a stranger like that.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.590
I hope you will soon know
my friend Alicia.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.034
She's an American,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.554
from the Connecticut branch
of the Delancey family.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.989
Although even the best-bred Americans
don't sound particularly fine,

22:55.120 --> 22:58.510
there's a freshness to her manner
which I find rather tonic.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.598
Her family were treated outrageously
there during the late war,

23:01.680 --> 23:04.240
punished for their very
loyalty to the Crown.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.557
Americans really have shown themselves
to be a nation of ingrates.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.916
Only by having children can one
begin to understand such a dynamic.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.035
Yes.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.797
Susan, I've been looking for you.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.036
The afternoon coach brought this note.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.589
Perhaps Charles has succeeded
with Miss Summers.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.878
Oh, it's as I feared.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.716
Miss Summers refuses to keep Frederica.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.598
She says she must think
of her school's reputation.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.995
Preposterous.
I've never heard of her school.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.830
- Could that be them?
- What, Frederica? Here?

23:54.360 --> 23:56.351
Hello, hello. Here we are.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.471
- Is this Frederica?
- Yes.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.838
Allow me to introduce our niece,
charming girl,

24:01.960 --> 24:03.188
uh, Miss Frederica Vernon.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.831
Welcome, Frederica.
We've longed to know you.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.873
My brother, Reginald DeCourcy.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.871
Hello. Pleased to meet you.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.678
Good afternoon, Frederica.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.354
Good afternoon, Mother.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.713
It's as I feared.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.518
Excuse me, I must go to my daughter.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.678
Poor Frederica.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.990
- Poor mother of Frederica.
- What?

24:30.080 --> 24:33.914
The daughter is, I understand,
a troubled girl.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.758
I only saw fear.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.797
She hasn't had tea.
Could be a lack of nourishment.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.359
Where is Frederica?

25:00.440 --> 25:03.000
In our rooms, practicing the pianoforte.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.953
She practices quietly.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.230
Don't look. Frederica's watching us.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.750
- Watching us?
- Through the window. Don't look.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.077
How odd, to be spied upon.</font>

25:15.280 --> 25:17.236
That's the parent's lot.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.675
We bring these delightful
creatures into the world,

25:19.760 --> 25:21.034
eagerly, happily,

25:21.120 --> 25:24.032
and then before long, they are
spying upon and judging us,

25:24.120 --> 25:25.917
rarely favorably.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.551
Having children is our fondest wish, but
in doing so, we breed our acutest critics.

25:30.640 --> 25:34.838
It's a preposterous situation,
but entirely of our own making.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.117
- I marvel at your good humor.
- Well, what alternative have we?

25:38.200 --> 25:41.033
It's the way of the world.
We must accept it with a smile.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.031
Of course, when the little
ones are very small,

25:43.120 --> 25:44.712
there's a kind of sweetness

25:44.800 --> 25:48.110
which partially compensates
for the dreadfulness which comes after.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.916
- You worry for Frederica's future?
- I worry for her present.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.629
Acknowledging that the responsibility
for securing her future rests with me.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.390
Go.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.069
Come on.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.635
- Pretty? You think so?
- Yes.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.317
- You don't?
- No, I would not have said that.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.960
But in any case, beauty matters little.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.878
It's vivacity and a lively intelligence
one looks for,

26:42.960 --> 26:44.473
even from the young.</font>

27:01.200 --> 27:03.714
Oh, I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.916
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it, my dear?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.996
He's here. He is here. Sir James is here.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.553
- Who?
- I'm so sorry.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.079
Please excuse me.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.070
Oh, Frederica...

27:19.760 --> 27:21.557
So sorry to come like this.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.553
I... I suppose you weren't expecting me.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.393
Sir James, allow me
to introduce my sister-in-law,

27:27.800 --> 27:30.792
Mrs. Catherine Vernon,
and her brother, Mr. Reginald DeCourcy.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.438
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

27:35.720 --> 27:38.473
How kind of you to ask. Uh, excellent.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.516
Truly very well, thank you.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.310
Uh, excuse my hurry in coming.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.233
The lack of notice beforehand,
et cetera, et cetera.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.558
Truth is, I forgot to write.</font>

27:49.640 --> 27:52.279
Then it was too late, uh, now I'm here.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.395
Took the liberty of a relation.
Hoping to be one soon.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.435
I must say, you looked surprised.
You were astonished to see me.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.035
No? Not? Well, that's how it looked.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.357
- Yes, I was astonished and I still am.
- Um...

28:08.880 --> 28:10.836
An impressive establishment
you have here, sir.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.275
My congratulations. Immaculate.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.589
- Mr. DeCourcy is Mrs. Vernon's brother.
- Very good.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.514
It's her husband, Charles Vernon,
who has Churchill.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.993
Churchill?

28:23.800 --> 28:24.949
That's how you say it?

28:26.160 --> 28:29.197
All together like that?
"Churchill."

28:29.280 --> 28:31.555
Oh, well, that explains a lot.

28:31.640 --> 28:35.599
You see, I'd heard "church" and "hill,"
but couldn't find either.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.036
All I could see was this big house.</font>

28:40.000 --> 28:42.514
Fine name. Churchill.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.591
Marlborough, right? The general?

28:44.680 --> 28:48.309
Showed the French. You must be very proud.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.879
No connection.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.191
But I believe I have heard it spoken of.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.791
I... I think you mentioned it. Churchill.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.713
Yes, I think you did,

28:58.840 --> 29:04.472
but again, oh, I heard "church" and "hill"
and I couldn't see either.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.277
But I realize I was in mistake

29:08.360 --> 29:11.033
and now stand corrected.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.316
Happens quite a lot. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

29:13.880 --> 29:16.872
Reginald, would you be so kind
as to take Sir James to see Charles?

29:17.600 --> 29:19.336
I think you'll find
Charles very well-versed

29:19.360 --> 29:23.114
in the advanced agricultural methods
in which you've taken such an interest.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.515
Oh, yes!

29:24.600 --> 29:27.672
Advanced agricultural methods,
very much so.

29:27.760 --> 29:31.753
Uh, Collins, who supervises Martindale
for me, speaks of them often.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.833
A landowner of the current day
must know all sorts of things.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.030
That is our role.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.834
"Hello, Collins!" I say.

29:40.920 --> 29:44.230
"What advanced agricultural methods
have we today?"

29:46.080 --> 29:47.399
Excellent.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.314
Oh. There you are.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.713
Are you asleep?

29:56.880 --> 29:59.030
- No, Mama.
- Well, what, then?

30:00.080 --> 30:03.277
You were hiding from me. Please explain.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.759
No.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.871
My strange girl.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.598
- What were you up to back there?
- What?

30:13.120 --> 30:15.680
Rushing out
before Sir James entered the room.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.352
I couldn't bear to see him.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.433
"Couldn't bear."
Ungenerous manner of speech.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.678
Frederica, dear,

30:24.800 --> 30:27.155
Sir James Martin is
a kind-hearted young man

30:27.240 --> 30:31.597
whose only offense seems to be wanting
to provide you with a life of comfort.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.193
Have you nothing to say?

30:37.000 --> 30:41.915
Dear, our present comfortable state
is of the most precarious sort.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.350
We don't live, we visit.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.919
We're entirely at the mercy
of our friends and relations,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.275
as we discovered so painfully at Langford.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.437
Now, here, you seem
to have won your aunt's affections.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.816
I think I served you well there, for I
believe she'd do anything to spite me.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.400
But such a dynamic cannot continue forever.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.989
- But Mama...
- "But Mama."

31:03.160 --> 31:06.470
I will not always be here
for you to contradict me.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.712
If a life of comfort such as Sir James
has to offer is not to your taste,

31:09.800 --> 31:11.199
what will you do?

31:11.280 --> 31:12.713
How will you live?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.791
- I... I could teach.
- T each!

31:15.480 --> 31:18.916
Had you been more in school,
you would not consider such a thing.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.310
Answer this.
When Our Lord wrote his Commandments,

31:22.480 --> 31:26.268
which did he consider so important
that he put it in the fourth position?

31:26.360 --> 31:28.555
The fourth position?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.471
Yes. The Fourth Commandment.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.831
I know the Commandments,
but not their order.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.316
See? This is what comes
of an irregular education.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.511
Yes, the Fourth Commandment.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.069
"Thou shalt not..."

31:43.160 --> 31:45.628
No, it's not a "shalt not." It's a "shalt".

31:45.720 --> 31:48.075
- "Thou shalt"?
- If I had not myself been present,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.549
I would wonder if I were even your mother.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.148
"Honor thy father and mother."

31:54.720 --> 31:55.835
I'm sorry.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.070
Have I done anything
that's dishonored you or Father?

31:58.320 --> 31:59.912
"To honor" means, among other things,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.639
to listen with respect
to a parent's sincere counsel.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.598
I do listen with respect, Mama.
It's just...

32:05.680 --> 32:09.036
If you will not pay attention to me, then
perhaps you will to a larger imperative.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.476
The law of the universe.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.394
An offer as splendid as Sir James's
is not likely to come around again.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.671
He has offered you
the one thing he has of value to give,

32:18.760 --> 32:20.034
his income.

32:21.200 --> 32:25.193
I fear and reproach myself,
having shielded you for far too long.

32:25.880 --> 32:29.759
Had I let you starve a little bit more,
you would resist much less.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.314
Mama, I was often hungry at school.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.833
Evidently not hungry enough.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.833
In any case, the starvation of the school
house is nothing like that of the destitute.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.388
- Is that what you want?
- No.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.670
I can see Sir James is a kind man

32:43.760 --> 32:46.672
and if it weren't a matter of marriage,
I'm sure I could like him.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.310
But marriage is for one's whole life.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.118
Not in my experience.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.760
Meanwhile, I must ask you not to speak

32:53.840 --> 32:55.176
to your aunt and uncle about this matter

32:55.200 --> 32:56.918
or seek their interference in any way.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.236
I insist. Promise?

33:01.400 --> 33:02.879
- Remember the Commandment.
- Yes.

33:08.600 --> 33:13.196
Sir James's arrival and its suddenness
requires some explanation.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.475
You were not too surprised, I hope?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.152
It was unexpected.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.118
Certainly. To me as much as anyone.

33:20.640 --> 33:24.269
I'm afraid Sir James's best qualities
are not immediately apparent.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.279
- Certainly, he's no Solomon.
- Solomon?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.998
The wise king in the Bible,

33:29.080 --> 33:33.119
who had the idea of dividing the infant
disputed by two mothers in half.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.836
Or in two.
I don't recall the exact wording.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.114
Yes, of course.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.077
So, Sir James is no Solomon.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.832
How many suitors of great wisdom

33:41.920 --> 33:44.070
can a young woman
expect to find these days?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.718
- I don't know.
- None!

33:45.800 --> 33:47.597
And, I confess, I ask myself,

33:47.680 --> 33:50.114
is such a quality
even desirable in a husband?

33:53.440 --> 33:56.113
How jolly! Tiny green balls.

33:58.520 --> 34:03.389
Mmm. Yes. Good-tasting. Quite sweet.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.839
What are they called?

34:05.640 --> 34:08.313
- Peas.
- Oh, yes. No, I knew that.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.159
I recall now.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.956
I must get Collins
to cultivate these at Martindale.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.871
Novelty vegetables.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.190
Could make quite a packet.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.795
Ah. Tiny.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.399
I'm enjoying Sir James's visit.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.358
His conversation is lively,
brings a new angle to things.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.976
What would you think if I took him
to see the Fredericksville farm?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.797
He mentioned that he had an interest
in agricultural methods.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.029
Yes.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.672
Frederic, be careful.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.637
Frederic, you must try to be good.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.400
He's utterly ridiculous.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.597
- Well, certainly he's no Solomon but...
- Solomon?

34:55.719 --> 34:59.030
The wise king from the Bible.
I know he's not that.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.518
But any man navigating
the cascades of romantic courtship

35:02.600 --> 35:08.152
and occasionally falling into those foaming
waters is apt not to appear at his best.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.355
What?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.989
A simple word, Reginald. "Comprehension."

35:13.080 --> 35:14.433
I admire your cast of mind,

35:14.520 --> 35:16.875
but I think you're not entirely sensible

35:16.960 --> 35:19.349
at the degree
to which you can intimidate others.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.760
Particularly a young man
over whom you have every advantage

35:21.840 --> 35:23.990
of position, looks and character.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.555
Sir James Martin is a fool because of me?

35:27.640 --> 35:30.279
Yes. Around you, he seems very silly.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.874
- Isn't he silly around everyone?
- No.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.951
I believe he's given everyone
the same impression.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.031
Well, they've only seen him around you.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.315
But you deny Sir James's intentions
toward you?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.868
- Toward me?
- He's clearly besotted with you.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.315
No, it's with Frederica he's smitten.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.839
- That's not possible.
- Well, he's proposed to her.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.456
How could such a blockhead
even be allowed to court your daughter?

35:53.480 --> 35:55.038
It's incomprehensible.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.317
This is the incomprehension
of the rich and easeful.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.676
You can afford to take the high ground
and add another layer to your pride.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.274
If you realized the full extent
of ridiculous manhood

36:04.360 --> 36:06.715
a young girl without fortune must endure,

36:06.800 --> 36:08.756
you'd be more generous to Sir James.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.271
It was so good you could steal away.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.999
We can only meet through such subterfuges.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.993
Mr. Johnson is relentless.
I will not be sent back to Connecticut.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.395
I don't see why he believes
that association with me

36:28.480 --> 36:30.198
would lower your reputation.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.076
But a question.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.799
Did Sir James mention to you
any plans to come to Churchill?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.598
Heavens, no. What folly.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.677
How did Mr. DeCourcy react?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.995
Well, I had some gratification there.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.510
At first he observed Sir James with an
attention not untinged with jealousy,

36:46.640 --> 36:49.154
but it was impossible
to really torture him,

36:49.240 --> 36:52.357
for I had to finally reveal
that his object was Frederica.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.118
Then he was all astonishment.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.870
Left to ourselves, I had no great difficulty
in convincing him I was justified.

36:58.960 --> 37:03.397
I don't remember the exact reasoning,
but it was all comfortably arranged.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.273
So what's your verdict on young DeCourcy?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.954
Well, he's not stupid
and he has a great deal to say,

37:09.080 --> 37:11.719
but I can't help but look
with a certain contempt

37:11.800 --> 37:16.271
on the fancies of a heart so doubting
the reasonableness of its own emotions.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.828
I vastly prefer
the generous spirit of a Manwaring

37:18.920 --> 37:24.631
who, deeply convinced of one's merit, is
satisfied that whatever one does is right.

37:24.760 --> 37:29.675
I know that no one really deserves you,
but young DeCourcy might be worth having.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.548
Excuse me, Frederica.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.713
When I came down this morning,

37:58.880 --> 38:02.236
I, I couldn't help but notice
you were reading a book.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.551
Which book was that?

38:06.920 --> 38:08.911
This volume of Cowper's verse.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.638
Cowper, the poet?

38:11.720 --> 38:15.554
He also writes verse? Most impressive.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.038
Yes, he's versatile that way.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.869
So, Frederica,
you read both verse and poetry?

38:29.600 --> 38:35.835
In this, I believe, you take after your
mother, who knows a great many things.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.549
Just yesterday, she cited to me
a story from the Bible

38:39.640 --> 38:41.437
about a very wise king.

38:42.440 --> 38:47.389
This reminded me of many such, uh,
accounts one learns in childhood.

38:48.080 --> 38:52.312
Perhaps the most significant
in forming one's principles

38:52.400 --> 38:54.994
is that of the old prophet

38:55.080 --> 39:00.154
who came down from the mount with tablets
bearing the Twelve Commandments,

39:00.960 --> 39:05.317
which Our Lord has taught us
to obey without fail.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.354
Twelve Commandments?

39:08.040 --> 39:09.040
Mmm.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.271
Excuse me, but
I believe there were only ten.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.555
Really?

39:18.000 --> 39:21.117
Only ten must be obeyed?
Excellent!

39:22.160 --> 39:24.151
Well, then, which two to take off?

39:25.480 --> 39:29.268
Perhaps the one about the Sabbath.
I prefer to hunt.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.954
- Well...
- After that, it becomes tricky.

39:33.040 --> 39:39.957
Many of the thou-shalt-nots, don't murder, uh,
don't covet thy neighbor's house or wife,

39:40.040 --> 39:42.554
one simply wouldn't do anyway.</font>

39:42.640 --> 39:44.790
Because they are wrong,

39:44.880 --> 39:48.429
whether the Lord allows us
to take them off or not.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.517
It's so kind of you.

40:03.640 --> 40:07.474
No, delighted.
Honored. My pleasure.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.391
Would you like me to sign a note?

40:10.840 --> 40:14.150
Oh, no. No documents.
Uh, no note necessary.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.672
All in the family or,
uh, hoping to be soon.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.512
And the carriage?

40:21.520 --> 40:24.796
Oh, yes, the carriage. Definitely.
Certainly.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.390
My pleasure. Honored.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.557
Oh, hello.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.079
- Good day.
- Good day.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.275
Do you know
where I might find your mother?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.590
I believe she has gone out.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.908
Gone out?

42:01.640 --> 42:04.200
- Are you all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.639
What is it?

42:07.760 --> 42:08.795
Tell me, what's wrong?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.599
Please say.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.633
Sir, I...

42:20.200 --> 42:22.236
I do not know to whom I can apply.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.188
What is it? Please, tell me.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.400
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

42:28.360 --> 42:32.638
It's just that you're the only one
I think Mother might listen to.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.039
Why would you say that?

42:34.840 --> 42:37.496
Well, she pays no one such regard
as she does you, except Lord Manwaring.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.953
What do you mean, Manwaring?

42:39.040 --> 42:41.110
No. I'm sorry.

42:42.240 --> 42:47.155
It's just that of all the people,
I thought Mother would listen most to you.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.992
Let me understand this.

42:53.160 --> 42:58.188
It's that you find Sir James's presence
and courtship of you unwelcome.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.280
If his presence here disturbs you,

43:01.320 --> 43:03.436
it's to Charles and my sister
you should apply.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.831
I promised Mother I would not.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.309
I don't understand.
Why would you promise that?

43:09.840 --> 43:11.637
She required it.

43:11.720 --> 43:12.994
What did she require?

43:14.760 --> 43:16.113
What?

43:16.680 --> 43:18.830
These silences are vexing.

43:18.920 --> 43:20.990
Mama forbade it.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.115
I don't understand.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.576
I promised not to speak
to my aunt and uncle on this subject.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.616
- For what possible reason?
- It's wrong of me to speak now,

43:26.640 --> 43:29.518
and I'd not have if I
weren't at my wit's end.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.079
But I can't marry Sir James.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.589
To what do you object?

43:36.600 --> 43:39.797
Well, you must have noticed.
He's very silly.

43:40.720 --> 43:44.190
- But besides that?
- Besides that?

43:44.280 --> 43:48.637
Yes, I confess the first impression
he made on me was also indifferent.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.115
But don't those knowledgeable
of such matters

43:51.200 --> 43:53.191
consider Sir James a good catch?

43:53.320 --> 43:55.356
Or "match" or whatever it is they say?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.675
A man of cheerful temperament,

43:58.760 --> 44:01.320
happy to devote a large income
to a wife's comfort.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.356
I would rather work for my bread.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.237
But what could you do?

44:05.360 --> 44:08.033
- I could teach. I could...
- T each?

44:08.600 --> 44:09.669
Yes.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.796
Must've been very little in school
to think that.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.119
T ell me, how did this happen?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.280
Your mother is a woman
of excellent understanding.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.471
Her concern for you is great,
though wise and clear-eyed.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.675
How could she be
as mistaken as you suggest,

44:24.760 --> 44:26.478
if you truly despise Sir James?

44:26.600 --> 44:31.549
I don't despise Sir James.
And I'm sure he's a kind man.

44:31.680 --> 44:37.789
And he has a charm, of a kind,
and certainly he is likeable.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.915
And I'm sure I could like him
if he were a cousin

44:41.040 --> 44:44.157
or a cousin's cousin
or a friend or a friend's friend

44:44.240 --> 44:45.958
or an in-law or a step-something.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.318
I just don't want to marry him.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.513
Come. Tell me the particulars.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.235
If they are as you say,
I can't for the world imagine

44:58.320 --> 45:00.117
your mother would remain
deaf to your wishes.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.393
Thank you.

45:12.360 --> 45:15.113
Catherine.
I'd like to thank you for this visit.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.471
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I must.

45:17.720 --> 45:18.755
Why?

45:18.840 --> 45:21.877
As you've said, it's important at this
season one of us be with our parents.

45:21.960 --> 45:26.909
- You've just decided this now?
- Yes, but before going, I must ask one thing.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.752
I'd be grateful if you could see
justice is done Frederica.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.274
She's a sweet girl who
deserves a better fate.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.920
- I'm glad you now see her worth.
- Yes.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.152
My eyes have opened to many things.

45:47.760 --> 45:48.988
Aunt.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.437
- I did something very wrong.
- Oh, I'm sure not.

45:52.560 --> 45:56.075
No, I did.
And now he and my mother have quarreled.

45:56.160 --> 46:00.073
He is to leave and it is my fault.
Mama will never forgive me.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.559
Don't worry.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.313
If any of what you fear comes to pass,
I'll happily intercede.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.279
Good afternoon, Catherine.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.635
That cough of young Frederic's worries me.

46:23.800 --> 46:26.268
I have from London
some of Dr. Preston's excellent lozenges.

46:26.360 --> 46:29.636
- Would you like them for the dear boy?
- Yes. Thank you.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.359
Also, is it true that
we're losing Mr. DeCourcy today?

46:32.440 --> 46:33.555
Yes, it seems that we will.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.032
How remarkable.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.317
When he and I spoke barely an hour ago,
he made no mention of it.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.675
But perhaps he did not then know himself.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.797
Young men are so impetuous
in their resolutions.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.757
Oh, I wouldn't say Reginald is impetuous.

46:48.840 --> 46:52.037
Oh, yes, he is.
He's like other young men that way.

46:52.200 --> 46:55.875
Hasty in making resolutions
and then just as quick to unmake them.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.912
I would not be surprised
if he were to change his mind and stay.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.673
- He seemed quite decided.
- Well, we'll see.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.072
Some strangeness also seems
to be affecting Frederica.

47:06.160 --> 47:09.755
I believe the girl's actually fallen
in love, with your brother the object.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.751
Sir, Lady Susan asked
if she might have a word with you.

47:27.840 --> 47:31.435
She asked if you'd be so kind
as to visit her in her dressing room.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.395
Come in.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.077
I beg your pardon for
calling you here, sir,

47:59.160 --> 48:03.233
but I've just learned
of your intention to leave today.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.997
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.109
You may close the door.

48:15.400 --> 48:19.393
I entreat you not, on my account,
to shorten your visit by even an hour.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.349
Well...

48:22.720 --> 48:26.679
I'm perfectly aware that after
what has passed between us,

48:26.760 --> 48:29.228
it would ill-suit either of us
to remain in the same house

48:31.840 --> 48:33.193
but it is I who should go.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.519
No. Why?

48:36.320 --> 48:39.835
My visit has already been
inconvenient for your family.

48:39.920 --> 48:44.232
For me to stay risks dividing a clan
affectionately attached to one another.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.896
<font color="#D900D9">Where I go is of little consequence,

48:46.920 --> 48:49.798
whereas your presence is important to all.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.428
It was terrifying
how close I came to destruction.

49:05.960 --> 49:09.191
It all started with Frederica,
in the grip of a madness of some kind,

49:09.360 --> 49:11.669
entreating Reginald
to intercede on her behalf,

49:11.840 --> 49:15.355
as if I was some kind of unkind mother,
not wanting the best for her child.

49:15.520 --> 49:19.718
Next, Reginald appeared at my rooms
with an expression of the utmost solemnity

49:19.800 --> 49:21.677
to inform me of the impropriety

49:21.760 --> 49:24.354
of allowing Sir James Martin
to court Frederica.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.394
I tried to joke him out of it
but he refused to be.

49:27.520 --> 49:29.317
Heavens. Is he really so pompous?

49:29.400 --> 49:30.799
The pomposity I assume.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.474
But it was his disloyalty
which outraged me.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.788
If he held me in true regard,

49:34.880 --> 49:37.872
he would not believe
such insinuations in my disfavor.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.919
A worthy lover should assume one has
unanswerable motives for all one does.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.076
Certainly.</font>

49:44.720 --> 49:45.994
Scarcely an hour had gone by

49:46.080 --> 49:48.548
when I learned that Reginald
was leaving Churchill.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.399
Well, something had to be done.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.677
Condescension was necessary,
though I abhor it.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.068
I sent for Reginald.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.096
When he appeared,
he seemed astonished at the summons

49:57.120 --> 50:00.112
and he seemed as though
he were half-fearing, half-wishing

50:00.240 --> 50:01.753
to be softened by what I might say.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.788
The outcome justifies
some portion of vanity, my dear,

50:04.880 --> 50:07.235
for the effect was no less favorable
than immediate.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.833
You brilliant creature.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.751
So, now I have many tasks.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.479
I must punish Frederica
for her application to Reginald

50:13.560 --> 50:16.358
and punish him for
receiving it so favorably.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.192
And I must make myself serious amends

50:18.280 --> 50:20.748
for the humiliations
I've been obliged to undergo.

50:22.280 --> 50:26.717
- Manwaring's in town.
- Manwaring. How is he, the divine man?

50:26.800 --> 50:30.315
Absolutely miserable about you
and jealous of DeCourcy.

50:30.920 --> 50:33.957
To such a degree I can't answer for
his not committing some great imprudence

50:34.040 --> 50:35.519
such as following you to Churchill.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.999
Heavens.</font>

50:37.080 --> 50:39.514
I think I've dissuaded him from it.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.440
If you do follow my advice
and marry DeCourcy,

50:41.480 --> 50:44.040
it will be indispensable
for you to get Manwaring out of the way.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.791
Only you have the influence
to send him home.

50:46.880 --> 50:50.395
And by remaining in town, I'll be able
to reward a long penance at Churchill...

50:51.560 --> 50:53.520
<font color="#D900D9">with a little welcome dissipation.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.641
Madam, Lord Manwaring has arrived
and begs to be admitted.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.754
Please ask him to wait.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.155
Miss Vernon.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.230
It's so good to see you here.
Might I help you?

51:19.920 --> 51:21.239
Yes.

51:21.680 --> 51:25.832
A friend was asking how,
in accord with Christian teaching,

51:25.920 --> 51:27.990
the Fourth Commandment
should be honored?

51:28.400 --> 51:32.712
The Fourth Commandment? Yes. "Remember
the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."

51:32.840 --> 51:36.469
No. I meant the Commandment
"Honor thy mother and father."

51:37.160 --> 51:39.594
The Fifth Commandment. My favorite.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.430
It's the Church of Rome
that has it as the Fourth.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.640
Yes, the Fifth Commandment.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.910
"Honor thy father and thy mother

51:46.040 --> 51:51.034
"that thy days may be long upon the land
which the Lord, thy God, giveth thee."

51:51.160 --> 51:53.515
Beautiful, profound.

51:53.600 --> 51:57.639
I believe one should apply
this sentiment of gratitude and loyalty

51:57.760 --> 51:59.716
to every aspect of our lives.

52:00.800 --> 52:06.557
We are not born into a savage wilderness
but into a beautiful mansion of the Lord,

52:06.640 --> 52:10.553
that the Lord, and those who have gone
before us, have constructed.

52:11.440 --> 52:16.036
We must avoid neglecting this mansion,
but rather glorify and preserve it,

52:16.120 --> 52:18.839
as we should all of the Lord's creation.

52:18.920 --> 52:23.232
Uh, the superb Baumgarten
has outlined this aesthetic trinity

52:23.320 --> 52:26.312
as beauty, truth and good.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.631
Truth is, uh, the perfect,
perceived by reason,

52:30.720 --> 52:35.714
uh, beauty, by the senses
and the good by moral will.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.516
From where do you come?

52:54.600 --> 52:55.749
Church.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.434
Why were you in church?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.594
Well, it is our religion.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.993
Yes, but this time of day,
neither morning prayer nor vespers.

53:08.120 --> 53:11.032
The sky had clouded over.
I was sure there would be a downpour.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.439
There was.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.558
Oh, you are quite drenched!
You must get into some dry clothes.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.914
Oh, excuse me.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.190
- Dearest, welcome.
- Oh, Mother.

53:39.400 --> 53:42.472
- What joy your letter gave us.
- I wrote too hastily.

53:42.680 --> 53:43.715
What?

53:43.800 --> 53:46.234
I couldn't imagine
that every expectation I had

53:46.320 --> 53:48.595
- would be dashed so quickly.
- You frighten me.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.396
Poor girl. Her one chance to break free.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.074
Who knows what punishment
her mother will now impose?

53:55.160 --> 53:58.436
But Reginald can't be blind
to such a lovely girl.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.999
He's become blind.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.834
Reginald is more securely
Lady Susan's than ever.

54:04.160 --> 54:08.119
Please don't tell your father.
I worry for his constitution.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.635
Tell me what?

54:32.120 --> 54:33.348
Susan, stop!

54:34.120 --> 54:36.588
Dreadful news. Mr. Johnson's been cured.

54:36.680 --> 54:37.795
Oh, how is that possible?

54:37.920 --> 54:40.878
No sooner had he heard you were in London
than he had a cure.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.428
Well, then could you do me
the greatest favor?

54:43.520 --> 54:46.273
Could you go to Seymour Street
and receive Reginald there?

54:46.400 --> 54:48.868
I dare not risk his and
Manwaring's meeting.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.872
Keep him with you all evening, if you can.
Make up anything.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.876
- Good day for it.
- Cheers.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.436
I'm sorry I wasn't there to greet you,
but didn't I provide a charming substitute?

55:30.120 --> 55:31.678
It's strange.

55:31.760 --> 55:35.833
You remain silent but Mrs. Johnson
couldn't stop singing your praises.

55:35.920 --> 55:36.955
Excuse me?

55:37.040 --> 55:41.670
I fear Alicia's rather fallen in love
with you. It's given me quite a scare.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.757
You're joking.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.034
But you did like her?

55:46.320 --> 55:47.639
Of course.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.432
I so admire Alicia.

55:50.840 --> 55:54.037
She has none of the uncouthness
one expects from Americans

55:54.160 --> 55:56.116
but all of the candor.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.351
Her husband, Mr. Johnson,
is older and rather disagreeable

55:59.440 --> 56:02.512
but a word of complaint
never drops from Alicia's lips.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Exemplary.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.599
Only by one's friends
can one truly be known.

56:07.680 --> 56:11.593
That Alicia is mine will, I hope,
help you think better of me.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.234
I already thought well of you.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.950
You were not plagued by doubt?

56:18.880 --> 56:21.348
Some things disconcerted me.
That you were not here...

56:21.480 --> 56:25.155
Please, Reginald, don't be severe.
I can't support reproaches.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.794
- But...
- No, I entreat you. I can't support them.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.748
My absence was to arrange a matter
so that we could be together.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.479
I'm forbidden to say more.
Please don't reproach me.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.790
- Have you considered what I asked?
- I have,

56:45.920 --> 56:49.071
and I believe that our affairs
require a caution and delicacy

56:49.160 --> 56:54.280
that perhaps, in our candid enthusiasm,
we might have insufficiently heeded.

56:54.760 --> 56:55.829
What do you mean?

56:55.920 --> 56:58.912
I fear that our feelings
have hurried us to a degree

56:59.000 --> 57:01.195
which is in ill accord
with the views of the world.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.557
- I'm sure, in time...
- Perhaps, with time,

57:04.680 --> 57:07.592
but given the poignancy of our feelings...

57:07.680 --> 57:09.830
- You no longer wish to marry?
- No!

57:09.920 --> 57:12.070
No, all I'm saying or...

57:12.240 --> 57:15.915
Or hesitantly suggesting is that
we postpone an open understanding,

57:16.000 --> 57:20.039
until the opinion of the world
is more in accord with our inclinations.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.914
- That could mean never.
- No, no.

57:26.040 --> 57:28.031
Perhaps months.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.877
I confess that such delay
is against my every inclination.

57:31.960 --> 57:33.916
- Then let's...
- No, Reginald.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.514
I will not be responsible
for dividing your family.

57:37.920 --> 57:39.990
I thought we'd decided.</font>

57:40.400 --> 57:44.757
I know, such delay is insupportable,
especially when we're both in London.

57:45.800 --> 57:49.918
With separations, only those that are also
geographical can reasonably be tolerated.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.636
- What?
- I'm sorry, Reginald,

57:53.720 --> 57:56.917
but staying in London
would be the death of our reputations.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.514
We must not meet.

58:00.640 --> 58:03.791
And not to meet, we must not be near.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.996
As cruel as it may seem,
the necessity of it must be evident to you.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.119
Where will you go?

58:10.360 --> 58:13.079
Of course, it's necessary
that I remain in London.

58:13.240 --> 58:16.277
There are arrangements that I must make
for us to be together.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.709
But on the contrary,
I know your family crave your company.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.873
Particularly that elderly gentleman
to whom you owe so much.

58:25.080 --> 58:26.991
I would hate to be
the cause of an éloignement

58:27.080 --> 58:29.594
between you and your father,

58:29.680 --> 58:33.912
who, forgive me, might not have long left.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.278
There's no reason for worry that I know of.
Father's rather in his prime.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.554
Oh, thank heavens.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.198
So he's not in decline?

58:42.280 --> 58:46.114
He has the usual aches and pains
but is overall, I believe, in good health.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.430
In any case, he'd not want
any concern on that account,

58:49.520 --> 58:51.272
which he'd consider so much rubbish.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.634
Ah, mortality.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.238
Our mortality and that of others,

58:55.320 --> 58:56.514
but most particularly our own

58:56.600 --> 59:00.149
is the hardest and most intractable hand
life can deal us.

59:01.520 --> 59:04.114
I long to meet the dear gentleman.

59:04.200 --> 59:07.670
Of course, it's natural that
he would want to ignore or minimize

59:07.760 --> 59:11.150
- the cold, sad end that awaits us all.
- Not at all.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.798
Father's a Christian,

59:12.880 --> 59:15.713
for whom the prospect of the end
is neither sad nor cold.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.279
Ah, yes.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.874
Well, thank heaven for our religion.

59:19.960 --> 59:23.157
So important in this life
and most especially in the next.

59:24.320 --> 59:25.958
Must we really wait?

59:27.160 --> 59:29.151
I entreat you to reconsider.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.080
Lady Manwaring.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.993
Excuse me, I'm in such a state.

59:47.600 --> 59:48.600
I don't know what to say.

59:48.680 --> 59:51.717
Is Mr. Johnson at home?
I must speak with my guardian!

59:51.800 --> 59:54.951
Yes, of course, you poor dear.
I'll let him know you're here.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.237
Lucy Manwaring's here to see you.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.550
- Mr. Johnson!
- Lucy, please go in.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.496
- You must help!
- Dear Lucy, please.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.160
You must help me. Manwaring's left!

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.193
Madam. Mr. DeCourcy.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.794
- Oh, good day.
- Mr. DeCourcy.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.952
What a surprise to see you.
So kind of you to call.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.713
I must thank you for last evening,
for setting matters right.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.588
Lady Susan's explained everything.
I'm ashamed to have spoken as I did.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.797
- It was foolish of me.
- No, no, not at all. Most sympathetic.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.111
But you did not have to come to thank me,
courtesy did not dictate it.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.555
In fact, it's not my sole motive.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.313
Lady Susan has entrusted me
with a letter for you.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.709
"Strictly private"? How intriguing.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.551
Has an animal been injured?

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.475
No, private theatricals. Medea.
They perform next week

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.393
but prefer not to be watched rehearsing.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.232
Thanks again for the charming evening.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.511
She's with him now!
This can't continue! It mustn't!

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.073
Lucy, please. Don't.
Stay here, rest. Recover your equanimity.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.357
Equanimity? They're together now!

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.075
I implore you, come with me,
talk with Manwaring, reason with him!

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.753
As my guardian, won't you help?

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.513
Even if I found them,
what good could be done?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.433
Yes, heed Mr. Johnson. His counsel
is excellent in such matters.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.755
What have you? A letter?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.717
- In her hand?
- Return that letter, madam!

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.074
- It's not for you!
- Lucy, no.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.519
- Stop!
- Excuse me!

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960
Madam!

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.720
I believe you were on the verge
of making a grave error.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.117
You are Lady Manwaring?
Lady Manwaring of Langford?

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.988
You've recognized your friend
Lady Susan Vernon's hand

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.216
and assumed the letter's for you.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.916
- You think that lady is my friend?
- She is with my husband now.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.918
As we speak, he visits her!

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.356
That's not possible, madam.
I've just left her, she is entirely alone.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.714
Even her servant sent off.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800
Owen!

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.878
Owen, come here, stand here!

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.030
Tell this gentleman what you've seen.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.237
- No, Your Ladyship...
- Repeat to him what you told me.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.590
Well, sir, Lady Susan sent
her servant away and then you left.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.559
And a few minutes later,
Lord Manwaring arrived

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.835
and was received by Her Ladyship.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.632
- Alone?
- Yes, sir, I believe so.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.478
No one else came or went.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.997
No, stop!
The letter's for Mrs. Johnson only!

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.519
Here.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.676
"I send Reginald with this letter.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.633
"Keep him there all evening if you can.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.797
"Manwaring comes this very hour."

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.936
That's not possible.</font>

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.635
I must stop this!
Please, sir, come with me.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.349
What could possibly be gained?
It could even be dangerous.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.352
This is a matter for your solicitors.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.238
Mrs. Johnson, this is beyond
what I could have imagined.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.915
You promised that you would give up
all contact with this woman.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.798
I have no idea what she writes.
She's gone mad.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.394
I'm sorry to say, my dear,
that I hear the Atlantic passage

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.357
is very cold at this time of year.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.279
- Madam.
- Agonies, my dear.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.635
- What's happened?
- The worst.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.597
- Disaster.
- Disaster?

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.796
Mr. DeCourcy arrived
just when he shouldn't have.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.793
Lucy Manwaring had just forced herself
into Mr. Johnson's study to sob her woes.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.031
Has she no pride?
No self-respect?

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.031
What an impression she makes,

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.516
bursting from Mr. Johnson's library,
wailing like a struck child.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.149
Seeing the letter in your handwriting,
she tore it from Reginald to read aloud.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.719
- No!
- Yes.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.711
"Manwaring comes this very hour."

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.109
- And Reginald heard that?
- He read it himself.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.039
How ungentlemanly.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.152
It's shocking. I can't believe it.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.071
Yes, very shocking.</font>

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.470
A gentleman, entrusted with
correspondence marked "private,"

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.229
reads it regardless and then,
because of a few confidential remarks,

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.199
the obloquy is mine?
And who has acted badly in this affair?

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.637
Only you and I stand innocent
of reading other people's correspondence.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.117
Unluckily, Lady Manwaring
also wormed out of her husband's servant

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.271
that Manwaring visited you in private.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440
Oh.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.438
Facts are horrid things.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.950
Don't worry.
I'll make my story good with Reginald.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.632
He'll be a little enraged at first

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.188
but I vow that by dinner tomorrow,
all will be well.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.113
I'm not sure.
He was with Mr. Johnson when I left.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.275
Forgive me for saying it,

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.796
but I dread to imagine
what's being said in your disfavor.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.435
What a mistake you made
marrying Mr. Johnson.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.472
Too old to be governable, too young to die.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.789
Good afternoon, madam.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.552
Of course it might seem
outlandish or shocking to others.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.598
But we're not expecting others
to read our correspondence

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.796
and don't put things for their benefit.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.989
Manwaring only visited me
as his wife's friend.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.150
Friend? She herself denies this.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.955
Well, of course.
I was her friend when she was sane.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.439
Her great enemy since.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.990
Manwaring left Langford
to escape her deranged suspicions.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.656
In granting him an interview,

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.274
my sole motive was
to persuade him to return to her

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.635
and see what might be done
to ease the poor woman's mind.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.948
Yes, but why alone?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.272
Why did you arrange to see him alone?

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.830
You cannot divine the motive there?
Servants have ears,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.556
with the unfortunate tendency to repeat
whatever they imagine they've heard.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.950
I dreaded injuring
the poor woman's reputation still further.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.190
You imagine I could accept
such an explanation?

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.157
I can only tell you what I know to be true.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.118
- Did you succeed?
- What?

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.190
Did you convince Manwaring
to return to his wife?

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.280
Yes, I did.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.877
But it seems that her judgment
is too deteriorated to allow it.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.112
Her jealous and suspicious condition
is not one that will allow reassurance.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.555
You forget,
I saw the letter with my own eyes.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.791
No, I do not forget. I greatly resent it.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.316
A fault you compounded by misinterpreting
what you should never have seen.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.788
Do you think I would have confided
a letter to a third party

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.388
if I thought its contents
in any way dangerous?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.952
Have I not already explained everything

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.999
which the ill nature of the world
could interpret to my discredit?

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.638
What could so stagger
your esteem for me now?

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.310
After all we've discussed
and meant to one another,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.916
that you could doubt my actions,
my intentions, my word.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.634
I'm sorry, Reginald,
but I've reflected upon this deeply.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.035
I cannot marry a man
with an untrusting disposition.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.190
- I cannot have it.
- What?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.315
We cannot marry.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.556
Whatever commitment
was between us is severed,

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.394
any connection impossible.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.834
What are you saying?

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.269
Mistrust does not bode well for any union.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.070
I have a great regard for you.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.997
Yes, a passionate one,
but I must master it.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.991
Oh, Catherine! Catherine!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.911
- Reginald's returned.
- He's here?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.400
He's just gone to find your father.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.118
- It's not...
- No, no.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.792
No, the most happy news.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.314
- Our fears were in vain.
- What?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.118
- The engagement's off.
- How?

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.156
Well, Lady Susan broke it off herself.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.468
She did?

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.916
Reginald's most cast down
but I'm sure he'll soon recover

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.595
and, dare we hope, cast his look elsewhere.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.191
That woman's a fiend.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.515
- What do you mean?
- Lady Susan.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.757
She has an uncanny understanding
of men's natures.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.997
By forcing the rupture herself,
she's engaged Reginald's pride.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.078
Uncanny? I don't understand.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.595
Reginald will start to doubt everything
he's heard to her detriment.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.432
A guilty regret will overwhelm him

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.830
and slowly, surely,
he'll convince himself he's wronged her.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.511
- You frighten me.
- Yes.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.750
If Frederic Vernon,
renowned for his good sense,

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.479
let Lady Susan ruin him,
what chance has Reginald?

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.277
You speak as if your brother were not wise.
I'm sure he is.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.749
Everyone comments
on his lively understanding.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.959
You are the best of mothers

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.792
but Reginald has
just the sort of sincere nature

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.950
most vulnerable to a woman of her genius.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.710
- You think she's a genius?
- Diabolically so.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.354
Like the serpent in Eden's Garden.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.990
Does this woman always get her way?

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.197
From what I understand,
only clever tradesmen are astute enough

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.037
to see through her stratagems.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.278
Several banded together to send their
agents to intercept her on Seymour Street,

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.874
obliging her to pawn the
last of her jewels.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.395
Slay the fatted calf, my dear.
The prodigal's returned.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.669
What's wrong, my boy?

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.309
The joy of seeing
your aged parents eludes you.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.470
- Don't tease him, Father.
- It's a father's right.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.511
You'll have him fleeing back to London.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.388
No risk of that, I assure you.
London holds no charm for me.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.193
Oh, you've realized that? Good.
Never appealed to me at all.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:33.113
Dirty, noisy, noxious gases, soot.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.111
I don't see the point of towns.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.589
Far better to live on one's own land.
Everyone should.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.557
I'm afraid this relates
to my sister-in-law.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.837
Yes, sister.
Congratulations on your entire vindication.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.309
On the contrary,
I don't see you out of danger at all.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:48.834
- I assuredly am.
- What's all this about?

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.399
What's happening? I don't understand.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:53.750
Reginald, dear,
Frederica has prepared a charming piece.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.400
Help me persuade her to sing it for us.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.954
No. You are too kind, Lady DeCourcy.
I am not ready.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.471
Excuse me, Miss Vernon, Mother.
As much as I'd like to,

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.710
I'm afraid I am too tired
to be a suitable audience.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.677
So, if you'll excuse me...

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.399
No, you must stay. Frederica's a songbird.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.837
Never heard anything like it.
Don't deny us this pleasure, my dear.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.976
- Reginald, we need you to insist.
- Well, as I said...

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.194
No, I'm sorry.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.189
Excuse me.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.936
You must play it, my dear. Please.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.791
The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.475
Voice is remarkable, even to my hearing.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.676
She must have it from her mother's side.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.479
Lady Susan's voice is a clear,
natural soprano. Lovely.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320
Beautiful.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.395
It is, is it?

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.096
Do you expect visitors, Mother?

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.314
No, who would visit us?

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.630
Look who's come from London.
What an agreeable surprise.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.234
Excuse me for arriving this way.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.515
What a delightful family pose.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.155
Yes, it is the season for families to unite,
so especially welcome to have you here.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.912
Thank you, Charles.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.515
I do hope that recognizing
a mother's anxiety to see her child,

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.750
you might excuse my abruptness.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.479
Nothing to excuse.
Sir Reginald, Lady DeCourcy,

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.438
might I introduce my sister-in-law,
Lady Susan Vernon.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.589
Enchantée.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.591
Please forgive this intrusion.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.558
Now that I'm fixed in town,
I can't rest with Frederica away.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.916
- Isn't such anxiety new?
- Yes, it is, I entirely agree,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.752
but now I'm in London,

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.957
where the instruction Frederica needs
can so readily be found.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.679
- Her voice has some promise.
- Some? She's a veritable songbird.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.035
- The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.
- Do you?

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.553
Is this really Kent? Delightful.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.749
You are right, sir, Frederica has
the native talent a bird might,

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.354
but those few notes can get repetitive.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.314
But Mama, couldn't I stay?

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.192
"But Mama, couldn't I stay?"

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.314
Charming. I thank you, dear sister,

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.359
for making Frederica feel so at home
and welcome wherever she goes.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.599
I've secured you a lesson
with SignorVoltroni.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.830
Where the grand affair
of education is concerned,

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.876
there's no excuse for half-measures.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.155
Isn't it key, sir,
to cultivate her voice?

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.277
- A nightingale, didn't you say?
- Uh, yes, that's right.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.496
- The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.
- Delightful appellation.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.954
And perhaps with a teacher
such as SignorVoltroni,

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.951
it could even become true.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.120
- Frederica, have you your things?
- Leave for London now?

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.949
We'd so looked forward
to having Frederica with us.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.190
How remarkable. Only a few weeks ago,

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.990
it was hard to find anywhere for Frederica.
Now the world fights for her company.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.878
- Astonishing.
- Astonishing that she was neglected then

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.188
or is fought over now?

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.239
An excellent observation, dear sister,
but I will stop now,

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.914
because I know how my daughter
hates to be praised.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.148
How are you, sir? I hope well.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.589
We should go.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.557
Excuse me, Mama, I must collect my things.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.759
Yes, you must.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.354
We cannot buy a new wardrobe
for each displacement.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.352
The poor girl. Did you see her face?

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.056
I must talk to her, remind her
that she'll always have a home with us.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080
Or with us.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.037
If you are referring to the past,

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.635
I doubt her mother
will again risk misinterpretation.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.936
Henceforth, we can rest assured that
Lady Susan will make clear to Frederica

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.396
the consideration and affection
which guide her actions.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.616
I have not gone to the trouble
of retrieving Frederica

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.631
from Parklands to again be thwarted.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.554
Maria Manwaring may sob,
Frederica may whimper

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.159
and the Vernons may storm

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.437
but Sir James will be Frederica's
husband before the winter's out.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.909
- You brilliant creature.
- Thank you, my dear.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.396
I am done submitting my will
to the caprices of others.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.710
Of resigning my own judgment
in deference to those

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.439
to whom I owe no duty
and have very little respect.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.433
Too easily have I let my resolve weaken.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.272
Frederica shall know the difference.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.635
You're too indulgent with the girl.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.757
Why let Frederica have him
when you could grab him yourself?

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.877
- Sir James?
- Yes, I know your unselfish nature,

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.952
but can you afford
to bestow Sir James on Frederica

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.792
while having no Sir James of your own?

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.040
Madam, Mr. Johnson sends word
he returns to dine.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.910
- Thank you.
- <font color="#D900D9">-</font> Are you insulting me?

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.829
The opposite.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.317
I don't doubt your ability
to get DeCourcy whenever you want him.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.072
But is he really worth having?

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.156
Isn't his father just the sort
of enraging old man

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.471
who will live forever?
And how will you survive?

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.678
On the allowance that Frederica,
as Lady Martin, might grant you?

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.830
As guests at Churchill?

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.913
I'd rather be married to my own husband than
dependent on the hospitality of others.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.955
We must protect her,
not just for her own sake,

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.996
but for her dear late father's.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.399
What can we do?

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.998
We must find the argument
to persuade her mother

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.072
it's in her best interest,
which of course is her only guide.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.956
That will mean a trip to London.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.589
Fortunately, Charles must have
some business there to justify such a trip.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.554
What a marvelous husband
you have, my dear.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.279
Charles seems to live to oblige.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.278
It's true. I've been lucky.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.576
Charles always seems
to have some pretext or other

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.953
for doing just what's wanted.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.990
Dearest. I believe you have
pressing business in London.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.111
Oh. Um, yes.</font>

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.389
Frederica?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.035
You're so kind to visit.
Frederica will be delighted.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.839
And how are the children?
Especially my dear Frederic.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.558
Very well, thank you.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.750
Frederica, come and see who's here!

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.037
I can't express my gratitude
for the hospitality you've extended us.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.078
- Not at all. Our great pleasure.
- Hello, Frederica.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.216
Good afternoon, my dear.
I hope you're well.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.275
Thank you.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.510
Oh, it is so good to see you.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.240
Frederica, why don't you go upstairs
and play a piece?

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.548
Select something charming

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.520
to show your aunt and uncle
what you've studied.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.395
With pleasure.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.910
You'll see the strides she's been making.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.598
Oh, do mind your head.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.312
Frederica plays all the new music.
Haydn, Himmel, Bernardini, Cherubini.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880
Do sit down.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.839
So you're happy
with the progress she's making?

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.071
Yes. Only in a city such as London

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.549
I believe could she have had
such instruction.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.561
Well, if Frederica is making
such good progress in London,

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.029
that complicates matters.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.395
What complication would that be?

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.520
We'd hoped that Frederica
might return to Churchill.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.676
She is greatly missed,
especially by the little ones.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.680
What a moving sentiment of cousinly regard.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.279
But my concern, my obligation

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.557
is to see the defects
in Frederica's education repaired.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.710
Could we invite one
of her teachers to Churchill,

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.678
- to continue her lessons there?
- What a kind thought.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.077
But these are London's
most sought-after masters.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.312
No invitation to a country retreat,
even such a delightful one as Churchill,

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.118
would be in their power to accept.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.270
Perhaps a private tutor, then?

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.839
Might I confess something?

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.560
Frederica and I have become
such great friends,

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.835
it would be hard for me to part with her.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.948
You might have noticed that for a time,
there was a strange tension between us.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.598
That has now happily disappeared.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.318
Excuse me, are you well?

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.870
Sorry, we so set our hearts
on Frederica's return.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.474
Oh, I understand completely.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.949
She's become an agreeable companion.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.635
Even her tendency to extreme quiet
I've grown to find rather soothing.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.038
But there is one factor that concerns me.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.270
- Does she look quite well?
- Oh, yes.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.709
That was your impression?

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.918
London's vaporous air is not,
I think, healthy for her.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.195
- Does she not seem pale?
- She does.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.593
The London air, these smoky gases,
cannot be salutary for her.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.958
Fresh country air is
what the young require.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.270
Yes. How curious they are.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.909
Does not the town's dank air
favor the spread of influenza?

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.913
- The influenza, in London?
- Several cases have been reported.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.519
It is after all the season for it.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.109
Of all the disorders in the world,

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.273
risk of influenza contagion is the one I
dread the most for Frederica's constitution.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.552
Shouldn't we consider, then,
removing her from this danger?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.591
Oh, what you say does give me pause.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.638
But it would be such a hardship
to lose my daughter's companionship

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.597
just when I've grown to rely on it.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.073
And, of course, her studies.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.077
Congratulate me, my dear.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.976
Frederica's aunt and uncle
have taken her back to Churchill.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.230
I thought you'd grown to enjoy
Frederica's company so.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.512
Well, comparatively. A bit.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.953
But I am not so self-indulgent

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.713
as to want to wallow
in the companionship of a child.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.758
Alas, I fear this is our last meeting,

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.195
at least while Mr. Johnson is alive.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.396
His business at Hartford
has become extensive.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.830
If I continue to see you, he vows
to settle in Connecticut forever.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.632
Oh, you could be scalped!

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.155
I had a feeling that the great word
"respectable" would someday divide us.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.869
Your husband I abhor
but we must yield to necessity.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.748
Our affection cannot be impaired by it
and in happier times,

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.753
when your situation is as independent
as mine, we will again unite.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.553
For this I will impatiently wait.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.596
I also.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.672
May Mr. Johnson's next gouty attack
end more favorably.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.275
Thank you.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.676
Do you know where Frederica is?
Lady Susan's written to her.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760
Oh.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.199
Frederica?

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.155
Frederica.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.279
A letter from your mother.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.755
Thank you, Aunt Catherine.
What does she say?

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.432
Well, she's written to you herself.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.996
My mother and Sir James Martin have wed.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.716
What?
How could that happen?

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.233
How could they possibly marry?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.276
To what do you refer?
Both were free to do so.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.952
He a bachelor, Susan a widow.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.912
Sir James Martin is a fool.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.718
Well, a bit of a rattle, perhaps.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.473
"A bit of a rattle"?
He's a complete blockhead.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.314
Well, there are three
possible explanations, as I see it.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.392
First, perhaps Sir James
has more merit than we've allowed.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.515
No.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.798
Well, second, perhaps in order
to secure your future, Frederica,

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.758
your mother thought it necessary
to make a prudent match herself.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.558
That could be the case.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.756
Mama has always been concerned
for my future.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.910
And the third possible explanation?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.752
That she came to love him.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.552
Well, there is a saying,

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:53.030
"The heart has its strangeness,"
or words to that effect.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:57.073
The heart is an instrument we possess
but do not truly know.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.869
Human love partakes of the divine,
or at least it has in my case.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.680
You'll find it in the writings of Rousseau.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.157
Julie, Or The New Heloise, I think.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.776
I will confirm the citation
if you're interested.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.076
I just find it incomprehensible
that so brilliant a woman

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.517
could marry such a pea-brain,
or peas-brain.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.736
It happens all the time.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.976
It strains credulity.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.195
Certainly, as you've said,
Sir James is no Solomon,

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.272
but if he can give Lady Susan
the happiness and security

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.256
which the sad events
of recent years deprived her of,

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.113
then he is someone
that I and all of us should value.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.032
I very much agree, Uncle.
We all should.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.794
I wish them every happiness
in their life together.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.470
Congratulations, sir,
on a match I long favored.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.949
<font color="#D900D9">There's a rightness to your being together.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.112
Not that any man could really
deserve Lady Susan.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.031
I agree most heartily.</font>

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.272
And I've pleasure in adding
that double congratulations are in order.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400
What?

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.479
The most beautiful woman in England,
present company excepted,

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.358
will soon be the most beautiful mother.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.715
Yes, I'm to be a father.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.313
Marvelous!

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.356
You certainly don't delay matters.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.634
Congratulations, sir.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.756
Yes. The very morning after the wedding,

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.356
Lady Susan hinted at the happy news,
which was shortly confirmed.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.670
How truly marvelous.</font>

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.115
I'm as proud as you can imagine.</font>

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.393
What's that?

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.909
Such a burden.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.877
When Lord and Lady Manwaring separated,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.514
Mr. Johnson,
who is Lucy Manwaring's guardian,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.318
invited her to live with us.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.472
Really? What upsets her?

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.949
The separation still. She goes on about it.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.109
What?

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.112
All this carrying on about a marriage
that ended weeks ago.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.155
If a woman fails to please her husband, why
go on about it, advertising one's failure?

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.216
Why announce to the world
that the man who knows you best

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.719
would rather be with someone else?

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.598
It seems as if Lady Manwaring
has failed to consider

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.274
the difference between the sexes.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.950
For a husband to wander
is not the same as vice versa.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.153
If a husband strays,
he's merely responding to his biology.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.276
That is how men are made.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.512
But for a woman to act
in a similar way is ridiculous,

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.635
unimaginable.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.115
Just the idea is funny.</font>

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.111
Couldn't agree more. Quite funny.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.194
I rather blame
Lady Manwaring's scene-making

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.236
for driving her husband away.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.868
But her loss has been our gain.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.793
As a result of the trouble
her solicitors caused,

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.155
we've had Manwaring stay with us
these past weeks.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.556
That's not inconvenient?

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.709
Not at all!

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.189
Capital fellow. Couldn't get on better.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.874
Loves to hunt, small and large game.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.232
Excellent. Excellent to have a guest.
And the talk that comes with it.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.553
Of course, Lady Susan's sharp,
but it's easier to talk with a fellow,

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.154
particularly one who
shares one's interests.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.118
Before long, we'll have another guest.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.428
Frederica.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.909
No. Of course, the baby!</font>

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.877
Manwaring? Manwaring?

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.478
Have you seen my husband?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.511
What have you been saying? Tell me.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.511
How is he?

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.478
Well, madam. Very well, I believe.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.029
Couldn't be better.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.319
- Tea?
- Mmm. Quite.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400
Oh!

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520
Look out!

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.876
Right.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.749
Ah! So, here's the church.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.357
But where's the hill?

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.759
Don't see it.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.073
Doesn't seem to be one.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.512
Strange. Odd.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.119
God bless you all!

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.160
Please excuse me.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.998
Your mother must be very proud.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.469
And I am enormously grateful to her.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.960
Without her efforts, I never
would have found such happiness.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.352
Do excuse me.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.112
And bearing false witness?

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.834
Oh, no, that would be the Ninth.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.270
You must be most proud of Frederica.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.989
Well, I would not say proud.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.311
I'm glad I was able to attend
to her education.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.637
My daughter has shown herself
to be cunning and manipulative.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.917
I couldn't be more pleased.
A Vernon will never go hungry.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.797
We must ask Frederica to sing.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.074
That would be delightful.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.798
The Surrey Songbird, we call her.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.917
What? No. Kentish Nightingale.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.336
Always called her that.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.750
Surrey Songbird? Nonsense.
Rubbish. Ridiculous.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.593
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Reginald DeCourcy.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.797
Over the past months,
I have continued to be startled

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.031
by Frederica's loveliness and good heart.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.354
I had wanted to write some verses
as a memorial to these discoveries.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.877
But they are now so extensive
they would form a volume.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.360
So I'll just read these few lines.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.913
"Mien engaging"?

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.838
Oh, yes, "mien," appearance or countenance.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.275
It's from the French "mien," I believe.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.879
I can find you the citation.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.399
Mrs. Reginald DeCourcy.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.056
As you may already know,

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.516
I take Lady DeCourcy's
requests as commands

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.158
and therefore, I will sing this piece.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.312
Over the mountains

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.955
And over the waves

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.558
Under the fountains

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.468
And under the graves

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.109
Under floods that are the deepest

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.795
Which Neptune obey

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.273
Over rocks that are the steepest

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.589
Love will find out the way

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.112
Though I detest imprudence
and sincere emotions of all kinds,

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.112
where Manwaring's concerned...

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.191
And very quickly
he was in good humor?

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.158
I see what you mean,
how flattery alters a man's spirits.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.719
It's delightful.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.354
Such a posture,
resenting a well-meaning parent,

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.635
is apparently common among girls her age.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.216
- They are perhaps undercooked.
- No, not at all.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.674
- They're perfect.
- Mmm. Yes!

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.638
Good-tasting. Quite sweet.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.360
I shouldn't have said anything at all!

01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.953
She's lovely.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.919
No DeCourcy should forget
the lengths to which Lady Susan went

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.235
to prevent Charles Vernon
marrying Catherine,

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.435
which, had she succeeded,

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.456
would have ruined
your sister's happiness forever.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.870
Lady Susan sent her servant away
and then you left.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.632
And a few minutes later...

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.636
Mrs. Johnson, this is beyond
what I could have imagined.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.831
I'll never forgive the trouble he's caused.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.433
Thank you, my dear.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.870
May his next gouty attack be a severe one.
