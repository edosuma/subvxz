10:21.270 --> 10:23.029
that no one pays attention to.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.848
Ah. Well, then,

10:24.866 --> 10:27.500
I suppose there's no need
to pay any attention.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.374
Okay, there was an elderly
Jewish family hiding in there,

10:34.468 --> 10:36.693
and I don't know
what to tell them.

10:36.786 --> 10:39.471
-(school bell ringing)
-(kids chattering)

10:39.698 --> 10:42.365
Well, Stewie, you've completed
your detention.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.050
What have you learned
from this experience?

10:44.202 --> 10:45.727
That your mother's a whore.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.134
Hey, Stewie.
How was your detention?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.228
Brian Griffin,
is that really you?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.971
Been a long time, it has.

10:57.065 --> 10:58.398
I saw you this morning.

10:58.550 --> 11:01.567
The world's gone and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.070
You lose track of time
on the inside, Brian.

11:04.222 --> 11:05.238
You wouldn't know.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.647
You ain't seen
the things I've seen.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.559
Preschool detention?
No, I guess I haven't.

11:09.577 --> 11:11.394
-What'd you do in there?
-Got jacked.

11:11.413 --> 11:14.464
-You look exactly the same.
-And yet I got jacked.

11:17.419 --> 11:20.011
Okay, time to make
this office my own

11:20.163 --> 11:23.072
and decorate it
with my prized achievements.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.666
Ah, let's start with
my Big Mouth Billy Bass

11:25.686 --> 11:27.018
with the battery removed

11:27.170 --> 11:30.105
so I don't have to be
interrupted by that nonsense.

11:31.599 --> 11:33.599
Ah, my framed ticket stub

11:33.694 --> 11:36.602
from opening night of
<i> Independence Day.</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:38.238
My Purple Heart.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.658
-(jazzy piano music playing)
-(lively chatter)

11:42.869 --> 11:45.111
Today, for
a special birthdays treat,

11:45.263 --> 11:47.497
I've acquired Marty McFly's amp.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.545
(low electrical humming)

12:00.111 --> 12:01.945
Who's ready to rock birthdays?

12:01.963 --> 12:03.722
(cheering)

12:05.967 --> 12:07.541
There.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.620
A lifetime of
fragilely framed achievements.

12:10.713 --> 12:12.731
(electric guitar blares)

12:12.882 --> 12:14.232
What the hell?

12:19.314 --> 12:20.313

12:20.465 --> 12:21.406
Mr. Lloyd!

12:21.633 --> 12:22.890
What is going on in here?

12:22.984 --> 12:24.817
(gasps)

12:24.970 --> 12:27.320
Ow! Ow! Aah!

12:27.414 --> 12:28.805
Sorry.

12:28.898 --> 12:30.081
Aah! That didn't work!

12:30.233 --> 12:31.657
Ow, my bones!

12:31.810 --> 12:33.810
I had a very good rotation guy
work on this.

12:33.828 --> 12:35.478
Ow, though!

12:35.497 --> 12:37.589
Ow! Please stop!

12:37.740 --> 12:39.424
Sorry. Sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.

12:39.575 --> 12:41.408
I'll call the guy. I-I don't
know, I don't know what to say.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.261
Griffin, is this some kind of

12:43.412 --> 12:45.430
secret birthday
celebration room?

12:45.581 --> 12:48.674
I made a decision
to cancel office birthdays,

12:48.827 --> 12:50.676
and it was very explicit.

12:50.829 --> 12:52.011
There was nudity?

12:52.163 --> 12:55.014
Mr. Griffin, you leave me
no other choice.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.258
-You're fired.
-Fired?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.611
Can I still get paid
and just not come?

12:59.762 --> 13:00.779
No.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.839
Well, I guess
it's time to say goodbye

13:02.857 --> 13:05.675
to the security guards
whose names I never learned.

13:05.693 --> 13:08.011
Take care, Cap'n.

13:08.104 --> 13:09.454
Stay golden, Chief.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.180
Be well, Buckaroo.

13:11.274 --> 13:13.124
Bye,
Francesca Louise Allessandro.

13:13.276 --> 13:15.943
Say hi to Max and Samuel
and your sister Eloise for me.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.629
And good luck
with your night courses.

13:17.856 --> 13:19.856
Hey, do you have, like,
a nickname on Instagram?

13:19.874 --> 13:21.257
I'm having trouble finding you.

13:27.048 --> 13:29.290
I can't believe you were fired
from the brewery.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.551
I mean, how are we gonna
pay our bills?

13:31.645 --> 13:32.718
That depends.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.295
When you use Venmo,
do they just, like,

13:34.389 --> 13:36.147
believe you
that you have the money?

13:36.299 --> 13:37.315
No.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.150
-Right?
-CHRIS and MEG: No.

13:39.302 --> 13:41.060
Fine. Maybe they'll take me back

13:41.212 --> 13:43.822
as the Radio City Rockette
with too-big shoes.

13:43.973 --> 13:46.074
(lively big band music playing)

13:49.830 --> 13:51.204
Shoes!

13:56.744 --> 13:57.985
Shoes!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.879
Should we just get him
smaller shoes?

14:00.031 --> 14:02.131
Wouldn't matter.
He butters his feet.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.178
Stewie, breakfast!

My name's Chris.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.088
You don't have a name
until I give you one.

14:25.106 --> 14:28.441
You're a little young and plump
to be in a place like this.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.609
You need a friend.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.944
Someone who can provide you
with protection.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.613
I could be your friend.

14:33.765 --> 14:36.023
All we'll need is
a BIC pen and a lighter.

14:36.117 --> 14:39.118
Why? So you can burn
a swastika into my butt?

14:39.212 --> 14:42.213
Well, you just ruined
the surprise, you goofball.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.613
Oh. Stewie.

15:12.137 --> 15:14.637
I don't understand
what's happening.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.989
The three sisters have
a magic hopscotch board

15:17.083 --> 15:18.583
that turns them
into superheroes,

15:18.734 --> 15:20.660
but only at night
and never if it's raining.

15:20.812 --> 15:23.312
It's too complicated and noisy.

15:23.406 --> 15:25.314
Yeah, it is
both of those things.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.408

Oh, there you are, Rupert.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.585
Funny how I never got
a visit in detention.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.729
Not even a letter.

15:41.015 --> 15:42.774
What do you mean
you couldn't find a stamp?

15:43.001 --> 15:44.016
Well, no need to mail it now.

15:44.169 --> 15:45.592
Show me the letter.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.170
Show me the damn letter!

15:47.188 --> 15:48.780
I met a new friend in detention.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.931
His name is
Thomas the Shank Engine.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.009
I think it's time you two met.

15:53.102 --> 15:54.768
You want to meet him? (grunting)

15:54.788 --> 15:56.028
What's going on in here?

15:56.181 --> 15:58.122
You don't know
what detention was like, Brian.

15:58.274 --> 16:00.516
I feel like I aged
four years in there.

16:00.535 --> 16:04.278
On the first day, an older boy
put two fingers on my nose

16:04.297 --> 16:07.023
and just took it right off my
face and held it in front of me

16:07.041 --> 16:08.633
and said, "I got it.
I got your nose."

16:08.860 --> 16:10.134
That ever happen to you, Brian?

16:10.361 --> 16:13.120
You ever seen your own nose
wiggling between two fingers

16:13.139 --> 16:14.955
right in front of your face?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.457
And he never gave it back.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.310
-Stewie, what's going on
in here?

16:19.462 --> 16:20.979

They've got my nose.

16:33.234 --> 16:36.661
Aw, looks like somebody was
overdue for his bath time.

16:36.812 --> 16:39.388
That's why you've been
so cranky.

16:39.407 --> 16:42.892
All right, after this, we'll get
you into your footsie jammies

16:42.910 --> 16:45.077
and tucked into bed.

16:45.230 --> 16:48.748
Ah, finally, I can put
that whole detention experience

16:48.900 --> 16:50.758
behind me and just live.

16:53.496 --> 16:54.178
Whoa.

16:54.405 --> 16:56.255
Yep, so that's how your granddad

16:56.407 --> 16:58.499
got his back tattoo

That's a story
for when you're older.

17:03.915 --> 17:05.931
The kids at school were asking
if you're a bottom or a top.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.433
They should not be asking that.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.935
They said if that was your
answer, then you were a bottom.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.604
Who are these (bleep) kids
you're talking to?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.699
I would like to have a word
with their attractive fathers.

17:19.264 --> 17:21.205

"productivity"

17:21.357 --> 17:23.041

a productive use of time.

That's from the 1945 Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical

20:47.229 --> 20:49.638
<i> Carousel,</i> about
carousel barker Billy Bigelow,

20:49.657 --> 20:51.916
whose romance with
mill worker Julie Jordan

20:52.067 --> 20:54.143
comes at the price
of both their jobs.

20:54.161 --> 20:56.829
If you want to know more
about it, ask your grandfather,

20:56.923 --> 20:58.405
who was dragged
to see it on a date

20:58.424 --> 21:00.591
and then had to get married
to touch boob.
