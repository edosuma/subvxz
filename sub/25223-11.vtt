Hello, and welcome to Mock The Week.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.080
I'm Dara O Briain. Joining me
this week are Tom Allen, Zoe Lyons

00:38.080 --> 00:41.090
and Ed Gamble, Milton Jones,
Hugh Dennis and Geoff Norcott.

00:41.090 --> 00:44.050
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

00:49.020 --> 00:51.070
We start tonight with a round called
Picture Of The Week.

00:51.070 --> 00:54.010
I show the panel a topical image
and ask them to tell me

00:54.010 --> 00:56.040
what's happening.
So, what's going on here?

00:58.010 --> 01:02.000
Oh, is this Theresa May modelling
her bracelet that she's made from

01:02.000 --> 01:03.040
Panini football stickers?

01:07.060 --> 01:10.040
Is she saying,
"Yes, I'll screw this up too"?

01:13.010 --> 01:15.060
Is this Theresa May priming
the detonator

01:15.060 --> 01:18.000
in Boris's surprise
birthday present?

01:20.010 --> 01:22.040
I never get Philip Hammond's hair,

01:22.040 --> 01:26.000
cos it's like a side parting but
it's a centre parting as well.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.010
How has he done that?

01:30.010 --> 01:33.020
More a cleavage than a parting,
to be honest.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.020
Is she saying to the right wing of
her party,

01:35.020 --> 01:37.040
"Come on,
technology is the answer.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.020
"I used an app the other day that
helps track down immigrants,

01:40.020 --> 01:41.060
"called Uber."

01:48.030 --> 01:50.090
"Oh, my immigrant will be here
in four minutes!"

01:53.000 --> 01:57.080
Is she thinking, "This is the most
fun I have ever had in my life"?

01:59.080 --> 02:03.010
Is she saying, "Yes, we COULD be
brother and sister, couldn't we?"

02:06.050 --> 02:09.039
Is she so pessimistic about
Brexit that she's started

02:09.039 --> 02:11.000
an apprenticeship course?

02:14.020 --> 02:17.050
You know, like, when you've got
a really big deadline coming up,

02:17.050 --> 02:20.040
you attend to other jobs that
don't really need doing?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.020
APPLAUSE

02:28.040 --> 02:32.080
Is she thinking, "Ha ha ha ha
ha-ha! Ha ha ha ha ha-ha! Ha-ha!

02:32.080 --> 02:35.090
"Think of a caption for THIS,
Mock The Week."

02:40.020 --> 02:42.040
APPLAUSE

02:42.040 --> 02:44.080
Does anyone have the correct answer?
The actual answer?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.000
Do you want the actual answer?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.010
I would love the actual answer.
Yes, of course.

02:48.010 --> 02:51.020
It's Theresa May because it is the
Conservative Party Conference.

02:51.020 --> 02:53.040
Absolutely right.
Thank you very much, Hugh.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.030
APPLAUSE

02:55.030 --> 02:57.030
Yes, this is
Prime Minister Theresa May

02:57.030 --> 02:59.080
visiting an engineering company
in Birmingham this week.

02:59.080 --> 03:02.050
Birmingham hosted this year's
Conservative Party Conference,

03:02.050 --> 03:04.070
which saw May defend her
Brexit plan,

03:04.070 --> 03:06.060
as well as announce a range
of new policies.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.050
How do you think
the Conference went?

03:08.050 --> 03:11.010
She's doing well cos she is
up shit creek without a paddle,

03:11.010 --> 03:14.020
really, and worse still, if the
paddle doesn't arrive by next March,

03:14.020 --> 03:15.090
it's going to get stuck in customs.

03:17.050 --> 03:20.080
They've announced some really
weird policies, haven't they?

03:20.080 --> 03:23.080
They have. To take the view away
from Brexit. It's not ALL Brexit.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.050
They've announced that waiters and
waitresses will now be able

03:26.050 --> 03:28.010
to keep their tips, which is great.

03:28.010 --> 03:31.000
Unfortunately, there won't be any
waiters or waitresses after March

03:31.000 --> 03:33.040
cos they will have all gone home.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.090
It does feel like that's the most
middle-class policy you can

03:35.090 --> 03:38.030
put in, just so the middle classes
don't feel awkward when

03:38.030 --> 03:39.080
they're sat in Carluccio's.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.010
"Do you get the tip?
Oh, fine. That's fine.

03:45.020 --> 03:49.050
"There's nothing else to worry about
then. It's great, great. Perfect."

03:49.050 --> 03:51.090
It is an awkward moment, though.
I'll admit it.

03:51.090 --> 03:55.010
When you're going, "Do you get
this?" And they go, "No,"

03:55.010 --> 03:57.000
and you go, "How can I get it
to you?"

03:57.000 --> 03:59.060
And, suddenly, you're a member
of the Resistance

03:59.060 --> 04:03.040
and they're going, "If you want to
get me the tip, go to the bathroom

04:03.040 --> 04:05.050
"and go to the fourth cubicle."

04:05.050 --> 04:07.070
I think there should be
a new policy.

04:07.070 --> 04:11.030
No tips for any waiter that doesn't
write the order down.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.070
Yes. Oh.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.040
Right. So no tips for them.
Or one of those waiters who gets

04:15.040 --> 04:17.089
too friendly and sits down next to
you at the table -

04:17.089 --> 04:19.070
they can fuck off.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.079
APPLAUSE

04:25.020 --> 04:27.070
Some restaurants do it already.
I mean, this is just to get

04:27.070 --> 04:29.060
lots of restaurants in line,
isn't it? Yes.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.000
And one of the restaurants that does
give tips is Prezzo.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.060
And one of the tips they give is -

04:33.060 --> 04:36.030
don't work in our Salisbury branch
if you can avoid it.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.070
APPLAUSE

04:40.070 --> 04:42.070
That would be even better
if you'd said Zizzi's,

04:42.070 --> 04:44.080
which is the restaurant it was in.
Was it Zizzi's?

04:46.080 --> 04:49.040
Was there ever a more middle-class
thing to muddle up there?

04:49.040 --> 04:51.000
I thought I was bad.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.060
"Oh, I've muddled up
my high street pizzerias."

04:54.060 --> 04:57.080
They're trying to distract us from
Brexit, aren't they? Right.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.030
She's desperate to distract us. So
she's announced that there is to be

05:01.030 --> 05:04.060
a festival, a festival,
a national festival

05:04.060 --> 05:07.080
celebrating achievements,
which they are going to call

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
The Festival.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.090
It's supposed to be like a
Festival Of Britain, isn't it?

05:12.090 --> 05:15.080
But what's that going to have?
You know, like The Spice Girls,

05:15.080 --> 05:18.020
maybe the Magna Carta
and a jar of Marmite.

05:20.010 --> 05:21.070
A couple of Morris dancers.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.020
"Come down the main stage, yeah,

05:23.020 --> 05:25.040
"Stormzy's reading out
the Times crossword."

05:27.090 --> 05:31.050
If you're tutting the idea of
a British festival, then you're sort

05:31.050 --> 05:34.060
of already getting into the swing
of it, do you know what I mean?

05:34.060 --> 05:38.000
Is there a thing that
it's distracting us and is there

05:38.000 --> 05:41.080
a risk that by 2022, you know,
if we're all living in tents and

05:41.080 --> 05:44.020
having to queue up for the showers
as a result of Brexit,

05:44.020 --> 05:46.090
that they'll be able to go,
"Oh, no, it's a festival!

05:46.090 --> 05:49.010
"It's a festival!
Everybody have fun. Don't worry."

05:50.000 --> 05:51.030
APPLAUSE

05:53.060 --> 05:56.000
It's like we've got to
get behind it.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.060
Be positive. You know, I know you
lot, you all worry about Brexit.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.030
It's going to be fine.
Everyone's worried.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.090
It's like Bake Off going to
Channel 4, do you know what I mean?

06:02.090 --> 06:05.060
We all thought... It's great.
We all thought it would be

06:05.060 --> 06:08.010
a disaster, it's just sort of
all right, isn't it?

06:08.010 --> 06:10.070
It's got better, I would say, Geoff,
it's got better.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.000
APPLAUSE

06:13.000 --> 06:15.080
A bit of optimism, Britain,
come on, a bit of optimism.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.010
I love running up to Tories,
though, and saying,

06:18.010 --> 06:19.050
"Do you know what's OCCURRED?

06:19.050 --> 06:22.000
"Do you know what's OCCURRED?"
And they say, "No," and then you

06:22.000 --> 06:24.060
say, "Someone from Kurdistan,
you racist."

06:26.090 --> 06:29.080
What solution, by the way, for
Britain, for bringing Britain

06:29.080 --> 06:32.070
and Ireland closer together
was suggested by Boris Johnson?

06:32.070 --> 06:35.000
Oh, it's a great idea.
It's a really good idea.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.080
It's a really tangible, good idea.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.000
He wants to build a big bridge
in between Britain and Ireland.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.050
Which just sounds like someone has
asked him for a plan and

06:42.050 --> 06:44.080
he's panicked and come up
with something on the spot.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.090
Yes. "Yeah, big bridge from here
to Ireland and also,

06:48.090 --> 06:51.000
"um, an escalator up Ben Nevis
would be good."

06:52.040 --> 06:55.040
I'm not surprised at the bridge idea
because he loves

06:55.040 --> 06:58.010
this sort of thing, doesn't he?
Next, it will be

06:58.010 --> 07:00.080
Boris's Channel Cannon Crossing.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.010
AS BORIS JOHNSON: Come to Dover,
stuff yourself in a cannon.

07:04.010 --> 07:05.070
Boof! Jolly good fun.

07:07.030 --> 07:10.000
It's interesting how they think
a DIY project

07:10.000 --> 07:11.090
will bring the country together.

07:11.090 --> 07:14.040
I mean, I once tried to make
a BILLY bookcase with my dad

07:14.040 --> 07:17.030
and, within half an hour, I was
calling him a slag and crying.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.030
Basically, there should be
a disclaimer after everything

07:23.030 --> 07:24.080
Boris says. "Please be aware,

07:24.080 --> 07:27.040
"Mr Johnson may be overtired
or had too many Smarties.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.040
"Promises can be kept
as well as broken."

07:29.040 --> 07:35.000
What else did he do? How did
he troll Theresa May?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.010
He ran through some wheat fields,
or something. He did. Yes.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.020
Yes. Aahh.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.050
It looks like a terrible catalogue,
doesn't it?

07:46.060 --> 07:50.050
The idea, I think, is that he is...
teasing Theresa May by

07:50.050 --> 07:53.000
recreating
her naughtiest-ever moment.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.020
So she should respond
by taking a photograph

07:55.020 --> 07:57.000
of her shagging a junior researcher.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.050
APPLAUSE

08:01.050 --> 08:04.080
This looks like it would
not only scare crows,

08:04.080 --> 08:06.040
it would make them vote Labour.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.050
I'm not even sure that IS wheat.

08:09.050 --> 08:12.030
I don't think it is, I think it's
just dry grass. Yeah. No, well.

08:12.030 --> 08:15.060
But, you know, that sort of ruins
the joke a little bit.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.020
Oh, Captain Agriculture here.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.080
Sorry we had the wrong
arable product in our joke.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.030
Well, I think almost certainly

08:23.030 --> 08:25.040
the wheat will have been
harvested by now.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.090
"Dear Points Of View, I was...

08:28.090 --> 08:32.020
"I was disappointed in a recent
Mock Of The Week."

08:32.020 --> 08:34.090
How did the Conservatives suffer
an embarrassment

08:34.090 --> 08:37.000
before the Conference
had even started?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.070
They had an app that failed.
Well, it didn't fail. No.

08:39.070 --> 08:42.030
It had no security system on it.
No password. No password.

08:42.030 --> 08:44.080
An app with no password.
No password.

08:44.080 --> 08:49.000
You cannot go out and buy some
light bulbs in a hurry without

08:49.000 --> 08:52.020
setting up a password
which is deemed too weak repeatedly.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.060
All people had to do was just guess

08:55.060 --> 08:58.060
the e-mail of the Member of
Parliament and they could log in.

08:58.060 --> 09:01.010
So, you could go, "I want to log
into Boris Johnson's profile."

09:01.010 --> 09:05.060
You'd just be like "What's his
e-mail? BlozzaJozza69@hotmail.com."

09:06.070 --> 09:08.040
How do you hack Jacob Rees-Mogg?

09:08.040 --> 09:11.040
Do you know what I mean?
Does he even have e-mail?

09:11.040 --> 09:13.060
You rewrite his scroll.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.030
Break the seal on his letter wax.

09:18.090 --> 09:22.010
Technically, I think you have to
intercept the carrier pigeon.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.040
It's like an app like Grindr.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.040
But, like, Grindr tells you where
your nearest gay man is,

09:31.040 --> 09:33.020
do you think this is an app so you
can find out

09:33.020 --> 09:34.040
where your nearest TORY is?

09:34.040 --> 09:37.080
So it saves them all having to go
to Mumford & Sons concerts.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.040
I presume Grindr tells you where
there is a gay man nearby who

09:45.040 --> 09:48.010
wishes to meet up - not where...
Yeah.

09:48.010 --> 09:50.010
..where the nearest gay man is.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.060
That would be amazing, if you go...

09:52.060 --> 09:54.090
Yeah, you do have to
register for it.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.090
It doesn't just look at your iTunes.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.060
I'm working on my version
for gay women.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.030
Zoe's going to make one
for gay women?

10:03.030 --> 10:05.060
Yeah, yeah, Muffler,
I think I'm going to call it.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.010
What sort of noise would it make?
No idea!

10:11.010 --> 10:12.080
POP!

10:13.090 --> 10:18.060
Moving on - why have the people of
Kent been hearing this noise...

10:18.060 --> 10:21.020
CLICKING, SQUEALING

10:21.020 --> 10:23.080
..in the last week? It's the Beluga
whale, wasn't it?

10:23.080 --> 10:26.020
It is a Beluga whale. Benny.
Benny the Beluga Whale.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.080
He doesn't know he's called Benny,
by the way. Of course

10:28.080 --> 10:32.000
he doesn't know. He didn't arrive in
with a name tag. No, he didn't.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.070
It's not a sperm whale, but it's
probably swallowed so many

10:34.070 --> 10:36.050
condoms now, it basically is.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.080
GROANING

10:38.080 --> 10:42.040
I love it when you look at me like
a disappointed father, Dara. Yeah.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.090
How do they know this isn't, like,
just two Russians

10:45.090 --> 10:47.040
in a weird pantomime outfit?

10:49.020 --> 10:51.010
APPLAUSE

10:53.000 --> 10:56.050
At the end of that round,
the points go to Ed, Zoe and Tom!

10:56.050 --> 10:58.010
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

11:01.020 --> 11:04.050
Now we play a round called
Boris Johnson's Bridge Of Lies.

11:04.050 --> 11:07.010
This game involves Tom Allen
and Milton Jones,

11:07.010 --> 11:09.080
so, if you could make your way to
the performance area, please.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.040
This round is a stand-up challenge.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.040
I launch the Wheel Of News,
and, wherever it chooses to stop,

11:14.040 --> 11:17.060
one of our performers must step
forward and talk about that subject.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.080
OK, here we go,
let's spin the wheel.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.060
The first subject is Childhood. Oh.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.040
Well, hello.

11:29.030 --> 11:33.000
Anyway, Childhood, yes. I think
the most stressful thing about

11:33.000 --> 11:35.050
being a child is if
it's someone's birthday.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.070
I do think the social whirl

11:36.070 --> 11:38.090
for nine-year-olds is really
quite exhausting.

11:38.090 --> 11:41.000
And say it was someone's birthday in
your class.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.060
Say it was, like, Ryan's birthday.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.040
Ryan would have been bought a pad of
pre-printed invitations on which

11:45.040 --> 11:47.010
he would have had to write his
details.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.050
So, you basically get an invitation
which basically read,

11:49.050 --> 11:52.030
"RYAN... is having a birthday party

11:52.030 --> 11:56.000
"on the 23RD OF MAY."

11:56.000 --> 11:58.090
And then what would happen is you'd
forget all about

11:58.090 --> 12:02.030
Ryan's birthday party until the day
of Ryan's birthday party

12:02.030 --> 12:05.000
and then your mum would walk in
and go, "OH, SHIT!

12:07.030 --> 12:10.000
"It's Ryan's birthday party,
we ain't bought him nothing,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.060
"you can't go empty handed,
people will think we're poor.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.090
"What does Ryan like?" And this was
a time in history when I'd say

12:15.090 --> 12:18.090
something like, "Oh, I don't know,
maybe a Tamagotchi?'

12:18.090 --> 12:21.020
My mum would say, "What the hell
is a Tamagotchi?" I'd say,

12:21.020 --> 12:23.080
"It's just like a key ring. It's
a bit of fun, like, you've got to

12:23.080 --> 12:26.040
"give it food and water, keep it
alive, make sure it doesn't die,"

12:26.040 --> 12:27.070
and I remember my mum saying,

12:27.070 --> 12:30.010
"We've been doing that for you
for nine years!"

12:32.070 --> 12:35.000
And then you would be driven around
to Ryan's house,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.040
complaining all the way. Your mum
saying, "You'll enjoy it

12:37.040 --> 12:39.060
"when you get there," knowing full
well, you wouldn't.

12:39.060 --> 12:42.000
Right, you'd get there, you'd be
allowed to walk up the path

12:42.000 --> 12:44.030
on your own, in the background
you'd hear the sound of...

12:44.030 --> 12:48.030
IMITATES CAR SPEEDING OFF
..which was your parents deserting
you for the afternoon,

12:48.030 --> 12:50.070
with these strangers.
Right, you'd ring the doorbell.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.060
Ryan's mum Anne would
answer the door.

12:52.060 --> 12:55.050
Anne, who was having a very
stressful time because Anne

12:55.050 --> 12:59.000
was organising the birthday party
and the party bags. And party bags

12:59.000 --> 13:00.060
back then were very stressful.

13:00.060 --> 13:03.080
I'm sure party bags now are all just
iPads and... taramasalata.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.040
But, back then, it was a tiny
plastic bag and you had to

13:08.040 --> 13:12.020
fill it up with felt tip pens, a box
of Smarties, a tube of Refreshers,

13:12.020 --> 13:15.040
and then a tiny game where you
had to get a ball bearing...

13:19.040 --> 13:20.070
..into a hole.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.080
APPLAUSE

13:21.080 --> 13:23.050
Which was enough! And Ryan's mum,

13:23.050 --> 13:26.000
Anne, would say,
"Come in, come in to my house."

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Then you'd have to go
and play games, right?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.010
It was always Musical Chairs,
although what musical

13:30.010 --> 13:32.090
they were doing it from, I don't
know, it was never Sondheim, was it?

13:34.030 --> 13:37.020
I think it was Agadoo. And then you
had to have a birthday tea,

13:37.020 --> 13:39.030
which Anne would have organised,
resentfully.

13:39.030 --> 13:42.000
And a birthday tea back then would
have consisted of crisps and

13:42.000 --> 13:44.040
chocolate together,
which is disgusting.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.080
And Pink Wafers, oh, Pink Wafers.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.060
Oh, they're so delicious,
aren't they?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.080
Mm. They taste of - oh - pink?

13:52.090 --> 13:55.020
What are they made of?
Cillit Bang? Nobody knows.

13:56.070 --> 13:58.010
And then you'd have party rings.

13:58.010 --> 14:00.060
Oh, party rings, never as
much fun as they sound.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.020
What is a party ring anyway?

14:02.020 --> 14:05.060
It's basically just a dried-up
biscuit covered in enamel!

14:07.050 --> 14:09.080
And just as you're trying to get
your teeth through that,

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080
suddenly the lights would go out
and I'd always think,

14:11.080 --> 14:14.060
"Oh, my God, are we being raided?"
But, no, then what would happen is

14:14.060 --> 14:18.070
suddenly Anne would re-emerge quite
satanically underlit by flames!

14:18.070 --> 14:21.040
And she'd walk in going
"Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha..."

14:21.040 --> 14:23.040
We'd all have to sing
Happy Birthday.

14:23.040 --> 14:26.030
It's probably the dreariest song in
the world - it's supposed to be

14:26.030 --> 14:29.000
the happiest day of your year. Then
Ryan would have to blow out

14:29.000 --> 14:31.060
his candles and he'd basically just
spit all over the cake.

14:31.060 --> 14:34.000
"Make a wish, Ryan." Maybe for a dry
cake. But you'd never get to

14:34.000 --> 14:36.060
try it because Anne would whisk it
away into the kitchen. Chop it up

14:36.060 --> 14:39.000
into chunks, shove it in a paper
Transformers napkin, put all

14:39.000 --> 14:41.080
of these chunks in the party bags,
hand these out to everybody and then

14:41.080 --> 14:44.000
turn to everybody and go,
"Get the hell out of my house!"

14:44.000 --> 14:46.070
APPLAUSE

14:51.000 --> 14:52.050
OK, that...

14:52.050 --> 14:54.060
LAUGHTER

14:54.060 --> 14:56.010
..leaves us with Milton.

14:56.010 --> 14:58.020
Let's see what your topic is.
Let's spin the wheel.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.090
And the topic is Jobs. Away you go.

15:07.030 --> 15:10.070
The first job I ever had was washing
dishes in an international

15:10.070 --> 15:12.080
radar station, but the dishes
were a lot bigger

15:12.080 --> 15:14.050
than I thought
they were going to be.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But that was quite
a stir-fry we had.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.010
I remember the last words
of my grandfather.

15:23.010 --> 15:25.010
He said, "You selfish boy."

15:25.010 --> 15:27.080
Not long after that,
I became a fishmonger.

15:35.010 --> 15:37.050
Hopefully, I've got a book
coming out soon.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.040
Shouldn't have eaten it, really.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.060
So much for Taylor Swift -

15:45.060 --> 15:48.050
she sent back my trousers un-mended.

15:51.070 --> 15:53.060
Eventually!

15:55.020 --> 15:57.000
Horse whisperers -

15:57.000 --> 15:59.070
what they do is they go up
to horses and they go...

15:59.070 --> 16:01.090
WHISPERS UNINTELLIGIBLY

16:01.090 --> 16:05.000
And the horses go...
"OK, fair enough."

16:06.040 --> 16:10.060
Beware Chinese horse whisperers.
They go up to horses and they go...

16:10.060 --> 16:12.080
WHISPERS UNINTELLIGIBLY

16:12.080 --> 16:14.070
That horse tells another horse...

16:17.070 --> 16:20.040
..that horse tells another horse...

16:20.040 --> 16:22.080
By the end,
the last horse is going...

16:27.030 --> 16:29.000
HE SNORTS

16:32.080 --> 16:36.030
At the end of the round, the points
go to Tom Allen! Come back.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.020
Our next round is called

16:41.020 --> 16:43.070
If This Is The Answer,
What Is The Question?

16:43.070 --> 16:46.010
On the board are six categories.
Geoff, which category

16:46.010 --> 16:49.000
would you like? Can I go for sport,
please, Dara? OK, your category

16:49.000 --> 16:50.040
is sport, and the answer is...

16:52.020 --> 16:53.060
What is the question?

16:53.060 --> 16:56.060
Is it how many alcoholic units
my grandad thought it was safe

16:56.060 --> 16:58.030
to consume before driving?

16:59.070 --> 17:03.090
Is it what's a sad number of
giraffes to see on an open-top bus?

17:10.089 --> 17:13.010
No. Er...

17:13.010 --> 17:14.079
Is it what's the biggest number

17:14.079 --> 17:17.069
any cast member of Love Island
has ever thought of?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.040
Is it how old was I when I realised

17:21.040 --> 17:24.050
I was too old to be telling people
my age in fractions?

17:26.050 --> 17:28.040
Is it due to a platform alteration,

17:28.040 --> 17:31.010
what platform is the
Hogwarts Express now leaving from?

17:33.010 --> 17:36.090
Is it how long in minutes
an avocado is ripe for?

17:38.070 --> 17:40.060
Is it how old was I when I first...

17:40.060 --> 17:42.030
Actually, doesn't matter.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
ZOE: Is it how many people turned up
to Peter Andre's last tour?

17:49.050 --> 17:52.020
Is it how many seconds
Remainers waited

17:52.020 --> 17:54.090
before demanding
a second referendum?

17:54.090 --> 17:57.000
I didn't expect that to work here!

17:58.060 --> 18:02.000
Is it how many weeks before
a gerbil has a midlife crisis?

18:05.010 --> 18:09.020
Is it eating how many
king size Mars bars in a row

18:09.020 --> 18:12.000
constitutes a cry for help?

18:14.040 --> 18:16.030
Anyone know what
the correct answer is?

18:16.030 --> 18:20.060
Yeah. How might a tosser say 5:30?

18:20.060 --> 18:25.000
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

18:28.010 --> 18:29.090
No, the actual answer is, I think,

18:29.090 --> 18:32.000
how many points did Europe get
in the Ryder Cup?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.060
Absolutely right,
thank you very much, Hugh.

18:36.090 --> 18:39.050
Yes, the question we were looking
for was what was the winning

18:39.050 --> 18:41.000
points tally for the European team

18:41.000 --> 18:42.080
at this year's Ryder Cup
golf tournament?

18:42.080 --> 18:45.010
Europe thrashed the United States
17.5 to 10.5

18:45.010 --> 18:48.050
to regain the Ryder Cup at
Le Golf National near Paris.

18:48.050 --> 18:50.080
Were you all gripped by the golf?

18:50.080 --> 18:52.060
Oh, so gripped, Dara!

18:52.060 --> 18:55.000
I didn't actually see a lot of it.
Tell me, did...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.060
ZOE YAWNS

18:56.060 --> 18:59.000
..did anyone manage to get it
through the big windmill?

19:01.060 --> 19:04.060
But it's like, I don't watch it
at any other time of the year,

19:04.060 --> 19:07.020
but this one has a couple
of things going for it,

19:07.020 --> 19:10.040
because it's intercontinental,
which is ludicrous,

19:10.040 --> 19:13.020
and we don't compete enough times
intercontinentally...

19:13.020 --> 19:15.090
It is funny, isn't it,
that it's all of America,

19:15.090 --> 19:20.060
and because it's so big, we all need
to gang up on it as Europe?

19:20.060 --> 19:24.060
It's like Mike Tyson
versus eight kids. I know.

19:24.060 --> 19:28.040
When it started, the Ryder Cup was
just Great Britain versus America.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.030
Then we never, ever won,

19:30.030 --> 19:34.000
so we joined up with the rest of
Europe, and now we win all the time.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.050
Mm, can you think of any parallels?

19:36.050 --> 19:40.060
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

19:42.030 --> 19:44.050
Look at that picture of diversity.
I mean...

19:44.050 --> 19:47.000
That's not Diversity,
it's not them.

19:49.010 --> 19:53.000
There's eight shades of blonde
there, that's how diverse golf is.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.060
You see the Europe player
Ian Poulter -

19:56.060 --> 19:59.090
they nickname him The Postman,
because he always delivers a point.

19:59.090 --> 20:02.040
That's not what postmen do!
It doesn't make any sense.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.080
Unless Ian Poulter
delivers it next door

20:04.080 --> 20:06.060
or claims you weren't in.

20:08.050 --> 20:10.030
And in the final hole,
puts that card,

20:10.030 --> 20:13.000
signs it and just
sticks it into the hole.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.080
I think it's too hard a game
to start playing.

20:15.080 --> 20:19.030
Like, most games, I'll go and have
a go at, but they should have,

20:19.030 --> 20:21.030
like, bumpers, like in bowling.

20:21.030 --> 20:24.050
Like, if you hit it down the fairway
and it starts to go off,

20:24.050 --> 20:26.090
it just goes "Boing!"
and comes back in again.

20:26.090 --> 20:32.040
On a giant bungee. Yeah! Yeah, like
a sort of swing... What was that?

20:32.040 --> 20:34.020
Swing Tennis? Swing Ball.
Swing Ball.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.080
Swing Ball! You were so close to it!

20:37.080 --> 20:41.080
If we'd been in the meeting in
the '50s when they tried to
come up with the name...

20:43.050 --> 20:46.020
"Could it be Swing Tennis? No...

20:46.020 --> 20:49.030
"Bally String? Roundy-Roundy
Bally Come Back?"

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I wanted to call it
what it really is -

20:53.000 --> 20:55.010
Thing In The Garden
Which Slowly Rusts.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.000
At an angle!

20:57.000 --> 21:00.030
Yeah, at a slightly
getting more disappointing angle,

21:00.030 --> 21:03.010
summer by summer...
We should really move that.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.000
"Toddler Splatter! Boof!"

21:05.000 --> 21:07.060
"Let's name it after
who it's for - Lonely Child."

21:09.000 --> 21:11.030
There seems to be a lot of kissing
in this photograph.

21:11.030 --> 21:13.060
Quite amorous, aren't they?
Yeah, with their wives.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.050
The weird one at the end
who's kissing his wife

21:15.050 --> 21:17.090
but has one eye still on the camera,
which is...

21:19.070 --> 21:23.080
I think he's got one eye on the wife
of the other player. Yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.080
He's already got a hole in one!

21:29.000 --> 21:31.060
Now I know why it's called
the Ryder Cup.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.060
TOM GROANS

21:33.060 --> 21:35.000
Oh, Ed...

21:36.010 --> 21:39.060
Moving on. Who believes that
they may have 1,000 siblings?

21:39.060 --> 21:41.050
Oh, that bloke.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.030
Next round!

21:46.030 --> 21:49.010
That bloke, the sperm donor,
wasn't it?

21:49.010 --> 21:54.030
Yeah? Yeah, this man, apparently,
he gave away so much that he's now

21:54.030 --> 21:57.090
got 1,000 offspring, which I think
is environmentally very unfriendly.

21:57.090 --> 21:59.060
Especially when you think

21:59.060 --> 22:01.080
how many of those little plastic
cups he must have used.

22:01.080 --> 22:06.080
I respect him - that is a man
who has monetised his hobby.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.070
Do what you love, do what you love.
Well, he thinks he's anonymous,

22:09.070 --> 22:13.000
but he's got one massive arm -
it's not going to be difficult.

22:15.090 --> 22:18.000
He's walking round...
It's in Holland, this.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.080
He's walking round Holland
like a fiddler crab, just going...

22:20.080 --> 22:22.090
With a giant claw.

22:22.090 --> 22:26.010
"Well, would you like me
to take out your suit?"

22:26.010 --> 22:28.000
"Do you think? Do you think?!"

22:28.000 --> 22:30.010
Once upon a time,
to have that many kids,

22:30.010 --> 22:32.060
you'd have to be a fearsome warrior,
like Genghis Khan.

22:32.060 --> 22:36.020
Now all you got to do is go to a
clinic and wank into a yoghurt pot.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.050
No, now I think... You can't do it
anonymously now.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.020
What, you just have to do it
in reception?

22:42.020 --> 22:45.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

22:47.060 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, you go,
"I'm sorry, wasn't there a booth?"

22:51.000 --> 22:53.030
"No, we needed it for storage."

22:54.080 --> 22:56.090
And can you imagine
Christmas afternoon,

22:56.090 --> 22:59.080
when you've got 1,000 siblings
sat there trying to watch...

22:59.080 --> 23:01.090
I don't know,
the Doctor Who Christmas special?

23:01.090 --> 23:05.020
"Shut up, Number 27,
I can't hear the Gallifreyan."

23:07.000 --> 23:09.040
He's obviously very virile
and, you know...

23:09.040 --> 23:14.010
Well, yeah, that's... The sheer
volume of... He's probably fizzing!

23:15.040 --> 23:17.080
OK. It was me.

23:19.020 --> 23:21.060
At least the...
Because, presumably, he'd said,

23:21.060 --> 23:24.010
"Yes, I am a trainee doctor
and architect,

23:24.010 --> 23:27.070
"who competes internationally
for Holland in basketball.

23:27.070 --> 23:31.060
"I am merely supplementing
my income by wanking into a cup

23:31.060 --> 23:32.080
"14 times a week."

23:32.080 --> 23:34.050
Is that how it works, then?

23:34.050 --> 23:37.020
Well, no, it has to be taken
from there and used properly.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.070
The baby doesn't just
come out of the cup.

23:39.070 --> 23:41.040
I'm very naive about all this.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.060
I know, this isn't our area
of expertise.

23:43.060 --> 23:45.040
It's not something I've ever been...

23:45.040 --> 23:48.070
It is some sort of container, it may
not be formally a cup, but if it is,

23:48.070 --> 23:52.000
it better have
"World's Number One Dad" on it!

23:53.000 --> 23:55.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

23:57.020 --> 24:00.030
At the end of the round,
the points go to Ed, Zoe and Tom!

24:00.030 --> 24:02.030
Ohh!

24:04.010 --> 24:08.030
Now we come to
Scenes We'd Like To See.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.010
So, if everyone can make their way
over to the performance area,

24:11.010 --> 24:12.040
I'll read out this week's topics,

24:12.040 --> 24:14.050
and we'll see what our panellists
can come up with.

24:17.090 --> 24:21.060
Right, here we go.
The first subject is...

24:24.090 --> 24:27.090
And with just a little paint,
and by removing that horrible rug,

24:27.090 --> 24:29.090
it's almost like you've got
a new wife!

24:34.040 --> 24:37.010
Today on This Morning,
there's no Holly.

24:37.010 --> 24:40.030
So, lads, you might as well
turn across to Sky Sports News.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.070
Breakfast news now.

24:45.070 --> 24:47.020
I had toast.

24:52.050 --> 24:55.010
Today, we'll be shoving
the Foreign Secretary.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.010
Welcome to Barging Hunt.

25:01.010 --> 25:04.020
The lighting system's up,
the irrigation system is in place,

25:04.020 --> 25:06.010
it's time for Hash In The Attic.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.080
Next, Boris Johnson's on Lorraine.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.040
And we can't get him off her.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.000
And, today, there will be
no Jeremy Kyle, unfortunately,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.060
because we've run out of
dreadful people.

25:27.070 --> 25:30.010
Next, it's Good Morning North West,

25:30.010 --> 25:31.070
or, as it should be called,

25:31.070 --> 25:33.090
WHINY VOICE: ..Y'all Right?

25:38.040 --> 25:41.000
Join us after the break when
we'll be making some street food,

25:41.000 --> 25:45.060
and, in fact, chef Anton is scraping
something off the road right now.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.060
Middle East property prices now,

25:49.060 --> 25:51.050
in Homes Under The Hamas.

25:56.030 --> 25:59.030
Next on Bargain Hunt, we've got
a real relic from the '70s,

25:59.030 --> 26:01.000
very rare, this -

26:01.000 --> 26:03.070
it's a referendum result
people actually respected.

26:03.070 --> 26:06.000
SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE, BOOING

26:08.020 --> 26:10.010
And, now, Michael Portillo

26:10.010 --> 26:13.020
with Great British Rail Replacement
Bus Journeys.

26:19.030 --> 26:21.040
This is Tipping Point.
Yes, that's right -

26:21.040 --> 26:24.090
the moment Susanna Reid finally
punches Piers Morgan in the face.

26:28.060 --> 26:31.090
Hello, welcome to
Bargain Celebrity Hunt,

26:31.090 --> 26:34.010
where I'm looking for
bargain celebrities.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.040
I just found Jedward by the bins.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.060
Oh, thank you, Piers.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.020
That was a very reasonable
and well-thought-out opinion.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.030
OK, the next topic is...

26:51.090 --> 26:54.080
And to those of you who wrote
Mr Ferguson's mobile telephone

26:54.080 --> 26:56.090
number on the wall
of the girls' toilet,

26:56.090 --> 26:58.050
he would like to make it clear

26:58.050 --> 27:01.040
that the last digit is a 5, not a 3.

27:05.010 --> 27:08.040
And, now, continuing our policy
of religious diversity,

27:08.040 --> 27:12.070
we are going to sacrifice a goat
to the Great God Imhotep!

27:18.060 --> 27:22.000
Ofsted man, he come.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.090
He say school not good.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.070
Now, children, I know it's
very, very nerve-racking awaiting

27:34.070 --> 27:37.040
your results,
but I've got some good news.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.010
My results are back, it's all clear,
it wasn't chlamydia,

27:41.010 --> 27:43.000
Miss Lyons is back in the saddle!

27:47.030 --> 27:50.000
Just a heads-up
for today's science exam -

27:50.000 --> 27:52.040
you will be required
to create a vacuum.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.000
Yeah, no pressure. No pressure.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.050
That was for Dara, I was just
trying to impress Dara!

27:57.050 --> 27:59.000
All right, all right.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.090
As many of you will know,

28:01.090 --> 28:04.060
this school has produced
a lot of good actors.

28:04.060 --> 28:07.040
You know, parents who pretended
to go to church in order to get

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
their children into the school.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.040
I will now read the register,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.080
and, hopefully, there are no more
teachers on it.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.020
Today is, of course,
the big school outing,

28:23.020 --> 28:25.080
and, so, I'd like to invite all
the gay and lesbian children

28:25.080 --> 28:27.070
to come to the front immediately.

28:32.070 --> 28:35.010
And, now,
a notice about school uniform.

28:35.010 --> 28:38.000
My wife will be wearing one
this evening, as it's my birthday.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.050
And the caretaker
has asked me to say...

28:44.050 --> 28:45.080
..take care.

28:50.070 --> 28:53.090
We have very strict rules
on piercings -

28:53.090 --> 28:56.020
only one kind is allowed.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.030
Jerome, show them your cock ring.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.070
Students, I would advise you

29:05.070 --> 29:09.020
to sometimes just think about people
less fortunate than you.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.080
Because I always find it cheers me
up, do you know what I mean?

29:14.080 --> 29:20.000
Drinking, smoking, fighting -
these are all three reasons

29:20.000 --> 29:22.060
for me to be very tired today.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.080
I'd like to apologise for
those students who saw that.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.060
Miss Jones has horribly
misunderstood what Mufti Day means.

29:38.070 --> 29:41.060
In an attempt to move with
the times, Mrs Smith is going

29:41.060 --> 29:44.000
to lead us in a rendition of
Onward, Christian Soldiers

29:44.000 --> 29:47.060
to the tune of Stormzy's
Big For Your Boots.

29:50.060 --> 29:56.050
As you know, I'm retiring after
40 years of teaching at this school,

29:56.050 --> 30:00.030
and, this week,
you boys have made me realise

30:00.030 --> 30:04.030
that I've absolutely
fucking wasted my life.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.080
At the end of that, the points go
to Ed, Zoe and Tom!

30:09.080 --> 30:14.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:16.030 --> 30:18.090
That's the end of the show.
This week's winners

30:18.090 --> 30:21.060
are Milton Jones, Hugh Dennis
and Geoff Norcott.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.090
Commiserations to Tom Allen,
Zoe Lyons and Ed Gamble.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.080
Thanks for watching,
I'm Dara O Briain, goodnight.
