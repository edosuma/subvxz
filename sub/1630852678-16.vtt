WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.438
- Stop it, right now.
Zac, stop it.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.740
<i>- FATIMA: Previously</i>
<i>on "Sistas".</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:08.742
- There was a fight
in the lobby.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.311
- And Zac is in jail too.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.380
- What if Aaron is the
father of this child?

00:13.480 --> 00:15.849
I don't want you to be
the father of this baby

00:15.949 --> 00:17.251
because I'm
not over Zac.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.719
- I'm okay with him
staying here.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.121
- I will gladly have
your food ready

00:21.221 --> 00:23.757
and anything else
you want.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.895
- Has the prince of Embicktou
found his future wife?

00:27.995 --> 00:29.396
- I'm sorry what?

00:29.496 --> 00:34.501
He's really a prince.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.837
- Can I have a photo?

00:36.937 --> 00:39.673
- Uh, sure, I guess.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.575
- This is so exciting.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.076
Are you going
to marry him?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.645
- Well, we just
met, you know.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.280
- Oh, we hope you do.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.948
You are beautiful.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.483
- Thank you very much.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.619
- And all the girls of our
nation will celebrate you.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.288
- Okay, we should
slow down now.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.523
- So, he's like
royalty, like a prince?

00:56.623 --> 00:58.525
Like heir to the throne?

00:58.625 --> 01:00.561
- Uh-huh, yes.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.763
- Damn.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.498
So, wait, wait, what
are y'all doing here?

01:04.598 --> 01:08.769
- We attend Spelman.
- Oh, nice. We went there.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.839
- Oh, um,
do you mind?

01:11.939 --> 01:14.074
- What?
Oh, take a picture, sure.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.550
Smile. Like a queen, radiant.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.986
- Yes.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.455
Oh, thank you so much.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.457
- Of course.

01:30.557 --> 01:33.861
- This is so exciting.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.163
Wait until I tell my mom.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.368
- So, you didn't
know none of that?

01:41.468 --> 01:44.471
- I didn't know any of that.
- What the shit, Sabrina?

01:44.571 --> 01:46.206
- He's a prince.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.674
- Okay, alright.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.176
Shit, I gotta look
him up now.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.745
Bitch, you -- Black Panther
and Eddie Murphy

01:51.845 --> 01:53.480
all rolled into one.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.316
- I had no idea.
I don't know, I mean, he's rich

01:56.416 --> 01:57.918
and he has a couple
of restaurants.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.420
- How?
But didn't you look him up?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.389
- No.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.626
- Bullshit.
Everybody looks people up.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.960
- A woman who
doesn't care

02:07.060 --> 02:08.428
about that kind of
stuff wouldn't.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.264
- So, we just gonna
sit here and lie?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.165
That's what we do now.
Just gonna lie.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.801
- Well.
- See, that's the shit, Sabrina.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.004
- Okay, okay, I did
look him up.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.039
- I knew you did.
Just say that.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.175
- But there was nothing
about him being a prince.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.143
- Okay, you're right.
- SABRINA: What do you see?

02:23.243 --> 02:25.045
- I mean, nothing about
him being a prince.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.413
What was the country?

02:26.513 --> 02:28.315
- I think they, they
said Embicktou.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.716
- Yeah Embicktou.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.721
- SABRINA: What?
- That's, that's him.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.861
- Oh, okay.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.931
Oh, girl.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.933
- You about to be on
your Megan Markle shit.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.569
I love her.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.504
- You think he woulda
told me about this.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.006
- Oh my gosh, when
are you seeing him again?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.575
- We're having dinner
tomorrow night.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.945
- That's great. That's great.
That's great. Bag 'em. Bag 'em.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.514
- Um, I-I-I I can't
believe this.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.051
- I mean, are you gonna
ask him about all this? Right?

03:04.151 --> 03:07.754
- He obviously didn't
want me to know so.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.290
- Okay, I don't care. I gotta
get some research on him.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.992
I-I gotta know.
I got to know.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.261
- Yeah, yeah, we
definitely gotta know.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.597
- Alright, I wanna know
everything about him now.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.131
[laughing] Prince.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.967
- Yeah, I need to know
everything about him too.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.369
- Okay, well, come on.
- Okay.

03:22.469 --> 03:27.074
Oh, but Danni, um, can we
not tell the girls right now?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.977
- Why wouldn't you wanna
gloat about this?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.846
- Danni, please?

03:32.946 --> 03:36.283
- Okay, fine, but you gonna have
to make me understand that.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.552

we can do about it now, so.

leave him in there.

Bonnie?

I know a few people too.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.845
- Do you?
- Yes.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.614
- Are they legal resources?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.216
Uh-huh.
Exactly.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.817
Well, use your legal resources.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.187
I'll use my resources
and we'll figure this out.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.089
- Okay, um, Robin.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.124
Did Robin call you?

04:51.225 --> 04:52.593
- He hasn't called
me back yet.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.962
And I really don't wanna
call him again.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.798
- Andi, please?
Please, call him?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.601
Please?
- Okay, okay.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.302
- Thank you.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.405
- Just give me a minute.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.841
I'll be right back.
Just relax.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.576
- Alright, I'm trying.
- If you can, okay.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.011
- Alright.

05:16.884 --> 05:21.154
- [phone ringing]

05:21.255 --> 05:22.923
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.625
- ROBIN: Hi, how are you?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.393
- I was able to
get Fatima out.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.595
Thank you.
- No problem.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.464
- ANDI: How's everything
going with Zac?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.266
- That's a little
more complicated.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.667
- [sighs] Shit...

05:33.767 --> 05:36.236
- I put in a call to a judge
who owes me a favor

05:36.336 --> 05:38.205
but he hasn't got
back to me yet,

05:38.305 --> 05:39.940
so it might be in the morning.
- Okay.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.075
- Don't worry,
I'll get it done.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.445
- Okay, thank you
so much, Robin.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.481
- So, am I seeing
you tonight?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.217
- Nothing would
make me happier.

05:50.317 --> 05:54.755
- Mmm, I love that
but I heard a but.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.024
- I'll tell you about
it later, okay?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.559
- Okay.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.861
- ANDI: Um, I have a few
more things I have to handle.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.529
I gotta go.
- Alright, that's fine.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.798
I'll talk to you later then.
- Yes.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.433
- Okay, bye.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.035
- Okay, bye.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.775
- What'd he say?

06:14.875 --> 06:18.011
- He said we won't be able to
see him until the morning.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.913
- Okay, thank you.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.817
- Of course.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.385
What are you gonna do?

06:25.485 --> 06:27.588
- I'ma stay here.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.590
- Fatima, you need to go
home and get some rest.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.625
- No, Andi, I got him
in this mess.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.161
- So, you're just gonna
stay here all night?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.696
- Alright, fine.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.232
- But I need to go to the office
and get my work cell.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.167
- I don't think that's
a good idea.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.902
I'll have a messenger
bring it to you.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.404
- Why?
- Hayden's still at the office.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.807
Do you wanna
go back to jail, or?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.308
- You smart.
- Right.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.910
- Yeah.
- Um, get your things. Come on.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.946
I'll take you home.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.348
- This don't feel right.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.149
- Listen, Zac is a big boy.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.621
And, he's been here before.
We'll see him in the morning.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.224
That way I can guarantee you
we can get in to see him.

07:04.324 --> 07:07.961
Okay?
- I'm hoping he's out by then.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.397
- We got this. Come on.
- Alright, thank you.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.232

07:47.968 --> 07:49.403
What's up man?

talking about me for?

08:07.221 --> 08:10.257
- We were talking about how
you allowed Que into my home.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.259
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.861
What?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.395
- Yes.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.699
- Th-th-that's, that's crazy.
- I'm knowing.

08:18.799 --> 08:24.304
- So, so, Que is at your
home by himself.

08:24.404 --> 08:28.108
- Yes, Calvin, he's at
home by himself.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.310
Why don't you join him?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.946
- Well, now, I don't
wanna go home.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.381
Can I get another drink?

08:34.481 --> 08:37.284
- Bitch, if any of my
gowns are gone.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.019
- Ssh.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.722
- What are you doing
here anyway? It's a gay club.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.156
Gay!

08:43.257 --> 08:47.594
Gay! Gay!
- Just shut up.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.531
Can't you see
that love is love?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.833
- Love is love.

08:52.933 --> 08:57.304
You gonna get slid up in,
drunk like that up in here.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.841
- You know, you
are a terrible person.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.710
- Unless of course, you
want to get slid up in.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.380
Then it's a free for all --!

09:06.480 --> 09:08.115

- I'm sick of you and
Sabrina's ass alright?

09:13.587 --> 09:16.557
- Great.
Well, be sick over there.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.358
- Fine.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.194
- Later.
- I'm gonna go.

09:20.294 --> 09:22.062
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.630
Where's your keys?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.165
- He didn't drive.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.000
- I'm cool baby.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.335
- He didn't drive?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.237
- His car was at
home when I left.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.705
- Good.

09:31.805 --> 09:36.210
So, Que is at your place.

09:36.310 --> 09:37.744
- Child, yes.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.748
- And why would
he let him stay?

09:41.849 --> 09:44.618
- Maybe Calvin has a
soft spot for him.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.154
Or a hard one.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.022

22:10.731 --> 22:13.033
- We are talking about Karen.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.701
Can I remind you of that?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.603
- Well, we might as well
make this about you.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.372
We're already here looking
for cameras and shit.

22:18.472 --> 22:19.773
- Danni.

22:19.873 --> 22:21.575
- How you know
that -- ain't in there

22:21.675 --> 22:23.177
putting up cameras
as we speak?

22:23.277 --> 22:25.579
- Oh, that's actually
a good point.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.648
I'm gonna go keep
an eye on him.

22:27.748 --> 22:30.617
I'll be back.
I'll go check on him.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.520
- Karen's not doing well.
- I know.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.456
- We have to help her
some kind of way.

22:36.557 --> 22:39.393
- Girl, we've all been through
our own version of this.

22:39.493 --> 22:43.197
- Hmm, yeah I know.

22:43.297 --> 22:46.900
- I wonder where they went.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.169
- Do you think they
went to the doctor?

22:49.269 --> 22:51.104
- That would explain
all damn day.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.207
- I think we need
to call her then.

22:53.307 --> 22:56.310
- No, we gotta roll up on that
ass, go to her house.

22:56.410 --> 22:57.678
- Yeah, that's a
better idea.

22:57.778 --> 22:59.746
She's not gonna
pick up our calls.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.181
- Andi.

23:01.281 --> 23:03.350
- ANDI: Huh, yeah?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.219
- How much longer
this gonna take?

23:05.319 --> 23:06.687
- I don't know.

23:06.787 --> 23:09.456
- EL FUEGO: Gonna be
another ten minutes.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.825
- Yeah, well we
wanna go to Karen's.

23:11.925 --> 23:13.427
- Why?

23:13.527 --> 23:16.663
- We think that she
went to the doctor today.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.900
- With Aaron?
- Mm-hmm.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.202
- Huh?
- Has she called you today?

23:26.573 --> 23:29.109
- No, she hasn't.

23:29.209 --> 23:31.545
Uh-uh, something's up.

23:31.645 --> 23:35.082
Okay, as soon as he finishes
we'll go to her house.

23:35.182 --> 23:37.451
- Okay.

23:37.551 --> 23:40.387
- Hurry up.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.422
Tell him to hurry up.

23:42.523 --> 23:44.525
- Okay, no bugs.

23:47.995 --> 23:49.563
- Are you sure?

23:49.663 --> 23:53.467
- Yeah, nothing.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.136
- Okay, that's great.

23:56.236 --> 23:57.604
- Sure.
- How much do I owe you?

23:57.704 --> 23:59.840
- For you, it's free.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.476
- No, come on.
I have to pay you something.

24:02.576 --> 24:04.611
- Nah, nah, it's all good.

Well, I'll see you ladies.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.418
- Uh, let me, uh, let me

24:27.334 --> 24:31.905
- Well, I mean, I would explain
but I just can't right now.

24:32.005 --> 24:33.807
- Okay.

24:33.907 --> 24:38.979
- Maybe you could take me
to dinner and we can talk.

24:39.079 --> 24:40.514
- No.

24:40.614 --> 24:43.150
You can cook me a good
home cooked meal

24:43.250 --> 24:45.385
then we can
talk about it.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.855

25:02.002 --> 25:03.804
- Yep.

25:03.904 --> 25:05.606
- You really think he
was gonna do that?

25:05.706 --> 25:07.908
- Well, now we
know he wasn't.

25:08.008 --> 25:10.177
- Andi.

25:10.277 --> 25:14.848
- Look, I just had to
check and be sure.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.150
- Okay.

25:17.251 --> 25:19.953
- What's that face?
- It's just not a normal thing

25:20.053 --> 25:23.223
to have to check for,
but it's fine. Let's move on.

25:23.323 --> 25:24.791
- Let's go to Karen's.

25:24.892 --> 25:27.027

drama queen to the next.

25:27.127 --> 25:28.695
Karen, here we come.
- Wait.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.898

25:30.998 --> 25:34.601
You, wait, you feel that way?
I'm gonna get my shoes.

25:45.012 --> 25:47.614

25:49.650 --> 25:53.453
- Hi.
- Hi, I think it's getting late.

25:53.554 --> 25:56.089
- Are you standing me up?
- I really don't want to.

25:56.190 --> 25:57.658
But I have to go
see my girlfriend.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.660
She's going through
some things.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.063
- Okay, you wanna come
to my hotel later?

26:03.163 --> 26:06.099
- No, I, I think
it'll be too late.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.568
- I don't mind waiting.

26:07.668 --> 26:09.570
I've been wanting to
see you for a while.

26:09.670 --> 26:14.208
- You know what?
How about you come to my place?

26:14.308 --> 26:18.078
- Really?

26:18.178 --> 26:19.546
Spend the night with me.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.683
- Mm, I like the
sound of that.

26:22.783 --> 26:24.952
- I'll have the doorman
let you up.

26:25.052 --> 26:26.453
- Alright, great.

26:26.553 --> 26:29.623
I'll see you then.
- Okay, I'll try and hurry.

26:29.723 --> 26:32.226
- I can tell you all about
the fun I'm about to have.

26:32.326 --> 26:34.461
- What fun is that?

26:34.561 --> 26:36.396
- Nah, I think I'd
rather see your face

26:36.496 --> 26:39.933
when I tell you about it.
- I'd love that. Sounds great.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.902

Oh hey.

26:56.850 --> 26:58.218
- You're here late.

26:58.318 --> 26:59.987
- I could say the same
thing about you.

27:00.087 --> 27:01.588
- I'm just catching up.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.190
- I see.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.858
How's it going?

27:04.958 --> 27:06.827
- What you mean?

27:06.927 --> 27:08.829
- Heard about earlier.

27:08.929 --> 27:13.166
Sorry about that man.

27:13.267 --> 27:14.902
But, it's, it's all good.

27:18.505 --> 27:22.109
For real.
- Good.

27:22.209 --> 27:25.445
[sighs]
- So, you need something, or?

27:25.546 --> 27:27.481
- Shit man, I mean,

27:27.581 --> 27:30.017
You know, I'm kinda new
around here, so.

27:30.117 --> 27:31.418
- Right.

27:31.518 --> 27:33.387
You're only here for
a few days right?

27:33.487 --> 27:35.455
- Yeah, then I'm back to London.
- Oh okay.

27:35.556 --> 27:38.592
So, what you wanna know?

27:38.692 --> 27:41.161
- I mean, the shit that's
going on around here,

27:41.261 --> 27:42.596
man, it's crazy.

27:42.696 --> 27:44.431
- Yeah.
- I mean, Fatima.

27:44.531 --> 27:46.900
- Man, you need to stay
away from her. For real.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.269
Actually, you ain't gotta worry
about it 'cause she gone.

27:49.369 --> 27:51.238
- Oh shit.
Good, I mean, she should be.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.340
Right? That's some crazy shit.
- Yeah, I know.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.975
- And then her
boyfriend came in?

27:55.075 --> 27:57.277
Are you, are you good?
- Yeah, man, I'm good.

27:57.377 --> 27:59.179
I'm good.

27:59.279 --> 28:01.515
But uh, that bitch is gone.

28:03.884 --> 28:06.186
- Come on, man.
What, what did, what did she do?

28:06.286 --> 28:07.621
- What you mean?

28:07.721 --> 28:09.656
- I mean, a young handsome
dude like you.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.525
What, she went
crazy over you?

28:11.625 --> 28:14.428
- Ah, shit, you already know.

28:14.528 --> 28:16.597
- I know.
- Hey, but I'm telling you.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.832
These bitches in Atlanta
be wilding out bro.

28:18.932 --> 28:23.270
That's why, um, I started
dating only the white girls.

28:23.370 --> 28:26.340
- I see.
- You see, gotta be careful.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.742
- What happened?
- That bitch is crazy.

28:28.842 --> 28:30.511
I mean, she showed
up at my house

28:30.611 --> 28:32.179
with a bat, -- my
house all up,

28:32.279 --> 28:33.547
smashing my car
windows and shit.

28:33.647 --> 28:35.516
- What the hell?
Why would she do that?

28:35.616 --> 28:37.217
- She's jealous, bro.

28:37.317 --> 28:38.652
- Is she?
- Oh yeah.

28:38.752 --> 28:40.454
Look, I told her
like this, I said,

28:40.554 --> 28:42.422
look, I don't want
you like that no more.

28:42.523 --> 28:44.558
Right?
But she keep coming at me.

28:44.658 --> 28:46.660
- Oh.
- And now she knows I moved on.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.530
White girl.
And now she acting all jealous.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.299
Like, honestly, I can't
get rid of this bitch.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.902
- Huh. You know there was
some talk about

28:55.002 --> 29:00.374
you harassing her boyfriend.
- Who told you that, Andi?

29:00.474 --> 29:03.143
- Nah, it's just, you
know, water cooler talk.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.545
- Right.

29:04.645 --> 29:06.413
I don't know why
they would say that.

29:06.513 --> 29:07.814
- Huh.
- Yeah.

29:07.915 --> 29:09.716
Yeah, she messing around
with some ex-con now.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.885
- Oh, I see. I see.
- Yeah.

29:11.985 --> 29:15.322
- Uh, we're y'all,
y'all messing around

29:15.422 --> 29:16.623
when y'all were
working here?

29:16.723 --> 29:18.358
- [laughs] You already know.

29:18.458 --> 29:19.793
- Oh shit.
- [laughing]

29:19.893 --> 29:21.595
- Do your boss know?
- No, no, no.

29:21.695 --> 29:23.597
No, we got a no fraternization
policy around here.

29:23.697 --> 29:25.265
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

29:25.365 --> 29:27.334
- That's right, that's right.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.236
- Oh, you know what?

29:29.336 --> 29:32.940
It's actually good that
you don't work here, right?

29:33.040 --> 29:35.008
- Why?

29:35.108 --> 29:37.344
- Come on, man.

29:37.444 --> 29:40.347
I know you hittin' Andi.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.815
- What?
- Oh yeah. [laughs]

29:41.915 --> 29:44.651
Yeah, I know.
- Why would you think that?

29:44.751 --> 29:47.087
- The way y'all talking
all the time.

29:47.187 --> 29:49.356
Come on, man, you
can tell me.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.124
Come on.

29:51.225 --> 29:54.394
- No, we're not.

29:54.494 --> 29:56.096
- You not?

29:56.196 --> 29:57.798
- No.

29:57.898 --> 29:59.967
I'm gay.

30:00.067 --> 30:02.636
- What?
- Yeah.

30:02.736 --> 30:06.373
You're actually
more my speed.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.842
- Yeah, I don't get
down like that bro.

30:08.942 --> 30:10.377
- I see.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.945
We work together so
that can never happen.

30:12.045 --> 30:13.580
- Yeah,
that ain't the only reason.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.584
- It's okay.
- Um, 'kay.

30:17.684 --> 30:19.820
So, your practice
is in London

30:19.920 --> 30:22.489
so if you were
actually hittin' Andi

30:22.589 --> 30:24.558
you wouldn't have to
worry about that I guess.

30:24.658 --> 30:28.395
- Yeah, but I'm gay
so it doesn't really matter.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.130
I love her shoes.

30:30.230 --> 30:33.267
- Okay.

30:33.367 --> 30:35.302
- Yeah, well, I'm
gonna get out of here.

30:35.402 --> 30:37.471
- Cool.

30:37.571 --> 30:40.741
- You have the best night.

30:40.841 --> 30:42.142
- Thank you.

30:47.014 --> 30:50.250
So, you sticking around?

30:50.350 --> 30:51.785
- Yeah, I got the
partners meeting.

30:51.885 --> 30:53.921
- Right.
Yeah, I got that email.

30:54.021 --> 30:55.722
What's up with that?

30:55.822 --> 30:57.057
- No idea.

30:59.493 --> 31:02.496
- Okay.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

31:02.596 --> 31:04.865
- Mm, yes you will.

31:06.867 --> 31:09.369
- But still sitting there.

31:09.469 --> 31:11.038
- I guess I am.

31:17.144 --> 31:19.346
- I'm not interested, bro.
- That's okay, I got you.

31:19.446 --> 31:20.714
- I don't...
- I got you.

31:20.814 --> 31:22.416
Something tells
me you might be.

31:22.516 --> 31:24.051
- You way off on
that one, bro.

31:24.151 --> 31:26.119
- Mmm.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.622
- Yeah, you can,

31:28.722 --> 31:30.457
- Alright.
- Alright.

31:30.557 --> 31:33.327
- Hey, you stay away from
them crazy ass chicks.

31:33.427 --> 31:35.429
- Okay.

31:35.529 --> 31:37.130
- Cool.

31:48.575 --> 31:54.314
- [phone ringing]

31:56.383 --> 31:58.185
- Hello.

31:58.285 --> 32:00.988

To accept press one.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.926
