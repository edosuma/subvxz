WEBVTT

01:25.503 --> 01:27.672
Woman: THAT'S ALL WE
HAVE TIME FOR TODAY,

01:27.839 --> 01:31.050
BUT WE WILL BE REVIEWING
THIS LESSON NEXT SUNDAY.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.719
Boy: WHAT FOR?

01:32.886 --> 01:35.138
IN THE HOPE THAT YOU
CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

01:35.305 --> 01:38.183
THAT YOU COULDN'T
ANSWER TODAY.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.559
LAURA?

01:39.726 --> 01:41.519
WILL YOU TAKE UP
THE COLLECTION, PLEASE?

01:41.686 --> 01:42.771
SURE.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.234
HOW MUCH
DO WE HAVE?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.320
Laura: So FAR,
ONLY 2 CENTS.

01:50.487 --> 01:51.946
I MEAN ALL
TOGETHER.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.368
1 DOLLAR AND 56 CENTS.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.870
YOU CAN ALL BE PROUD.

01:59.037 --> 02:01.122
THAT'S ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY
REVEREND ALDEN

02:01.289 --> 02:03.750
A VERY NICE
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.585
NO. MY MOTHER
SAYS WE CAN

02:05.752 --> 02:08.004
GIVE OUR OWN PRESENTS
TO REVEREND ALDEN.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.881
LIKE WE DO
EVERY YEAR.

02:10.048 --> 02:13.176
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE LIKE THE
REST OF THE CHILDREN AND JOIN IN?

02:13.343 --> 02:14.427
MY MOTHER SAYS
WE'RE NOT LIKE

02:14.594 --> 02:16.596
THE REST OF
THE CHILDREN.

02:16.763 --> 02:18.431
I SUPPOSE
SHE'S RIGHT.

02:18.598 --> 02:19.974
LET'S GO PLAY.

02:20.141 --> 02:20.850
NOT YET.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.143
MARY, YOU'RE
TREASURER.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.479
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
BUY FOR REVEREND ALDEN?

02:24.646 --> 02:26.856
I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T VOTED YET.

02:27.023 --> 02:28.900
I VOTE FOR
A NEW TIE.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.778
Laura: YOU CAN'T VOTE
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE.

02:31.945 --> 02:35.782
AND BESIDES, REVERENDS
DON'T WEAR TIES, SILLY.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.867
THEY CAN'T WITH
A BACKWARDS COLLAR.

02:38.034 --> 02:38.868
[LAUGHTER]

02:39.035 --> 02:40.453
Woman: LAURA'S
RIGHT, WILLIE.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.622
I VOTE FOR A BRAND-NEW
BALL AND BAT.

02:42.789 --> 02:45.291
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE THINKING
OF REVEREND ALDEN, DAVID?

02:45.458 --> 02:47.502
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE
A PRESENT FOR YOU.

02:47.669 --> 02:49.295
WELL, I COULD
HELP HIM USE IT.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.297
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT
GET HIM A NEW BIBLE.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.591
HEY, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.677
THE COVER'S FALLING
OFF THE ONE HE HAS.

02:55.844 --> 02:57.637
Woman: MOVED
AND SECONDED.

02:57.804 --> 02:59.514
ALL IN FAVOR?

02:59.681 --> 03:00.807
MOTION PASSED.

03:00.974 --> 03:03.810
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF A FINER PRESENT.

03:03.977 --> 03:07.897
MARY, SINCE YOU'VE BEEN OUR
TREASURER FOR ALL THESE MONTHS,

03:08.064 --> 03:10.275
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO BUY

03:10.441 --> 03:11.985
AND THEN
PRESENT THE BIBLE.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.403
I'LL ORDER IT
RIGHT AWAY.

03:13.570 --> 03:14.988
WHEN IS
HIS BIRTHDAY?

03:15.154 --> 03:17.949
Girl with braids: 5 WEEKS FROM TODAY.
SAME AS MY MOM'S.

03:18.116 --> 03:20.994
PLEASE, CAN WE
KEEP IT A SECRET?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.662
OF COURSE.

03:22.829 --> 03:26.541
WE WON'T ANY OF US SAY A
WORD UNTIL THE BIG DAY.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.459
PROMISE!
Children: YES.

03:28.626 --> 03:29.794
NOW, EVERYBODY...

03:29.961 --> 03:30.962
All: YES.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.964
OK!

03:33.131 --> 03:36.843
SERVICE IS OVER. SUNDAY
SCHOOL IS DISMISSED.

03:37.010 --> 03:37.886
LET'S COUNT IT.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.137
OK.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.847
David: GET ONE WITH
COLOR PICTURES.

03:41.014 --> 03:43.850
AND LEATHER COVERS. THAT'S WHAT
WEARS OUT FIRST--THE COVERS.

03:44.017 --> 03:44.851
REAL LEATHER IS NICE

03:45.018 --> 03:46.644
WITH LOTS OF GOLD
ON THE COVER.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.400
I'LL GET
THE BEST ONE I CAN.

04:05.038 --> 04:06.331
Charles: HOW WAS
SUNDAY SCHOOL?

04:06.497 --> 04:07.248
JUST FINE.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.374
WHAT DID YOU
LEARN ABOUT?

04:08.541 --> 04:09.959
WE LEARNED ABOUT
THE NEW BIBLE.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.210
Caroline:
WHAT NEW BIBLE?

04:11.377 --> 04:12.837
SHE MEANS
THE NEW TESTAMENT.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.315
SHOULDN'T THAT
BE A 9, NELS?

04:32.482 --> 04:33.608
YES, DEAR.

04:33.775 --> 04:34.734
Nellie: YOU SAID WE COULD
GET ANYTHING WE WANTED,

04:34.901 --> 04:35.735
DIDN'T YOU, MA?

04:35.902 --> 04:36.778
I SAID WHAT?

04:36.945 --> 04:37.862
Nels: GET AWAY FROM
THE CANDY, WILLIE.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.238
YOU'LL SPOIL
YOUR DINNER.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.573
Nellie: REVEREND ALDEN'S
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.158
YOU SAID WE COULD GET
ANYTHING WE WANTED.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.910
OH, I SAID
WITHIN REASON.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.244
CAN I HAVE
ONE PIECE, MA?

04:45.411 --> 04:46.871
JUST ONE, YES.

04:47.038 --> 04:49.832
HERE'S WHAT WE WANT. SOMETHING
NO ONE ELSE WILL THINK TO GIVE:

04:49.999 --> 04:50.917
A BIBLE.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.752
OH! UH-HUH.

04:52.919 --> 04:55.004
"GENUINE HAND-TOOLED
MOROCCAN LEATHER

04:55.171 --> 04:56.923
"WITH HOLY BIBLE
STAMPED IN GOLD

04:57.090 --> 04:58.424
ON THE FRONT
AND BACK COVERS."

04:58.591 --> 05:00.093
OH, THAT SOUNDS
VERY NICE.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.511
"MAGNIFICENT
ILLUSTRATIONS

05:01.678 --> 05:03.638
AND GENUINE
STEEL ENGRAVINGS."

05:03.805 --> 05:05.807
IT WAS $12.00.

05:05.974 --> 05:07.016
$12.00!

05:07.183 --> 05:08.142
MARKED DOWN TO 3.00.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.644
OH, WELL, THEN
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

05:09.811 --> 05:11.270
FOR 50 CENTS EXTRA,
WE CAN GET HIS NAME

05:11.437 --> 05:13.147
STAMPED IN GOLD
ON THE FRONT COVER.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.150
WHICH WILL MAKE THE PRAYERS
MORE WELCOME, I'M SURE.

05:17.902 --> 05:20.446
THAT'S NOT
FUNNY, NELS.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.490
WELL...CAN'T THEY
FOR ONCE JOIN IN

05:22.657 --> 05:23.700
WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN
TO BUY A PRESENT?

05:23.866 --> 05:24.784
GOOD HEAVENS.

05:24.951 --> 05:26.202
WE WOULD, BUT
THEY'RE GONNA PICK

05:26.369 --> 05:28.788
SOME SILLY GIFT THAT
THE REVEREND WON'T LIKE.

05:28.955 --> 05:29.998
Nels: WELL,
HOW Do YOU KNOW?

05:30.164 --> 05:33.501
I JUST KNOW.
THEY ALWAYS DO.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.795
GET AWAY FROM
THE CANDY, WILLIE!

05:35.962 --> 05:37.922
YOU CAN HAVE ONE
MORE PIECE, WILLIE.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.048
Harriet:
COME ALONG, DEAR.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.842
I'LL HELP YOU
FILL OUT THE FORM.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.403
YOU BETTER GET TO BED
BEFORE PA SKINS YOU ALIVE.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.864
WE CAN LOOK FOR
A LITTLE WHILE.

06:03.031 --> 06:05.158
ALL RIGHT, BUT
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

06:05.324 --> 06:09.287
HAD IT MARKED HERE.
TWO PAGES OF BIBLES.

06:09.454 --> 06:10.705
HMM...

06:10.872 --> 06:11.998
HERE'S ONE
FOR $1.00.

06:12.165 --> 06:14.125
YOU HAVE MORE
THAN THAT.

06:14.292 --> 06:18.671
THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
TREASURY HAS $1.67.

06:18.838 --> 06:20.757
HERE'S ONE
FOR $1.50.

06:20.923 --> 06:23.551
IT DOESN'T HAVE GOLD
LETTERING ON THE COVER.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.261
NO, BUT IT
LOOKS NICE.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.679
I'LL SEND FOR IT
TOMORROW.

06:26.846 --> 06:28.222
COME ON.
LET'S GET TO BED.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.151
LOOKIT!

06:40.318 --> 06:41.611
WOULDN'T REVEREND
ALDEN'S EYES POP OUT

06:41.778 --> 06:44.113
IF HE GOT THIS
FOR A PRESENT?

06:44.280 --> 06:47.200
"GOLD LETTERING ON
THE FRONT AND THE BACK.

06:47.366 --> 06:50.161
GENUINE HAND-TOOLED
MOROCCAN LEATHER."

06:50.328 --> 06:52.038
HOW MUCH?

06:52.205 --> 06:54.540
"MAGNIFICENT
ILLUSTRATIONS."

06:54.707 --> 06:57.293
HOW MUCH?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.170
IT WAS $12.00,

06:59.337 --> 07:01.714
BUT NOW IT'S
A BARGAIN AT $3.00.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.550
WE ONLY HAVE $1.67.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.136
NOW, PUT THE CATALOG AWAY
AND COME TO BED.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.663
WE CAN DO IT, MARY.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.748
WE CAN MORE THAN
DOUBLE OUR MONEY.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.250
COME TO BED.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.169
BUT WE CAN, MARY.

07:40.336 --> 07:43.214
SAYS RIGHT HERE
IN THE CATALOG.

07:43.381 --> 07:44.841
WE CAN MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY

07:45.007 --> 07:47.593
TO GET REVEREND ALDEN
THAT GOOD BIBLE.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.637
IF YOU WOULD JUST LOOK!

07:52.515 --> 07:54.392
LOOK AT WHAT?

07:54.559 --> 07:55.935
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE
IN THE CATALOG

07:56.102 --> 07:58.229
EXACTLY HOW TO DO IT.

07:58.396 --> 08:00.022
DO WHAT?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.358
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.651
[SIGHS]

08:03.818 --> 08:05.695
WHAT WE DO IS
WE ORDER 12 BOTTLES

08:05.862 --> 08:11.075
OF DR. BRISKIN'S HOMEOPATHIC
REMEDIES FOR $1.50.

08:11.242 --> 08:12.827
LAURA, THAT'S
NOT OUR MONEY.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.620
IT'S SUNDAY
SCHOOL MONEY.

08:14.787 --> 08:18.166
YOU SHOULD READ WHAT
THESE MEDICINES CURE.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.877
WORM FEVER, FACE ACHE,

08:21.043 --> 08:23.629
INFLUENZA, CROUP,

08:23.796 --> 08:24.714
DROPSY...

08:24.881 --> 08:26.048
Charles: HEY, UP THERE,
NO MORE TALKING.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.508
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ASLEEP.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.658
MARY?

08:52.825 --> 08:55.786
WHAT'S 12
TIMES 25 CENTS?

08:55.953 --> 08:59.165
UH...$3.00.

08:59.332 --> 09:01.459
THERE, YOU SEE? THAT'S HOW
MUCH MONEY WE'LL HAVE

09:01.626 --> 09:03.336
WHEN WE FINISH
SELLING THE MEDICINE.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.838
THEN WE COULD GET
HIM THE GOOD BIBLE.

09:06.005 --> 09:07.256
WE CAN'T SPEND THE
MONEY FOR ANYTHING

09:07.423 --> 09:08.966
BUT REVEREND ALDEN'S
BIRTHDAY BIBLE,

09:09.133 --> 09:10.092
AND THAT'S FINAL.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.427
NOW GO TO SLEEP!

09:30.363 --> 09:31.989
Caroline: DID
YOU SAY WATERMELONS?

09:32.156 --> 09:34.283
THAT'S RIGHT. EDWARDS SAYS HE
HASN'T HAD A DECENT WATERMELON

09:34.450 --> 09:35.368
SINCE HE'S BEEN
IN MINNESOTA,

09:35.534 --> 09:36.661
SO HE'S GONNA RAISE HIS OWN.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.537
WELL, IF HE LIKES
THEM, WHY NOT?

09:38.704 --> 09:40.456
BUT HE'S GONNA RAISE
5 ACRES OF THEM.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.624
5 ACRES!

09:41.791 --> 09:42.917
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S GONNA SELL THEM.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.710
OH! WELL, THERE AREN'T
ENOUGH PEOPLE

09:44.877 --> 09:45.753
IN ALL OF HERO TOWNSHIP

09:45.920 --> 09:47.505
TO EAT THAT MANY
WATERMELONS.

09:47.672 --> 09:49.507
WELL, MAYBE SOME OF
THE FOLKS CAN EAT TWO.

09:49.674 --> 09:50.925
I BET I COULD.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.635
WELL, THERE YOU GO. THE MAN
HASN'T PLANTED A SEED,

09:52.802 --> 09:54.387
AND HE'S ALREADY
A SUCCESS.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.722
JUST HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR CHANCES SOMETIMES,

09:56.889 --> 09:57.890
DON'T YOU, PA?

09:58.057 --> 10:00.393
Charles: THAT'S PART
OF BEING ALIVE.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.895
LIKE WE DID WHEN WE
CAME ACROSS THE PRAIRIE?

10:03.062 --> 10:05.606
YEAH. SURE, A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT THEY WERE GONNA RUN INTO,

10:05.773 --> 10:07.358
SO THEY WERE AFRAID
TO TAKE A CHANCE.

10:07.525 --> 10:08.901
BUT YOU WEREN'T AFRAID,

10:09.068 --> 10:12.280
AND EVERYTHING WORKED OUT
ALL RIGHT, DIDN'T IT, PA?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.572
Charles: THAT IT DID.

10:13.739 --> 10:14.991
BUT WHAT
IF IT HADN'T?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.953
WELL, YOU JUST TAKE A DEEP
BREATH AND START OVER.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.123
BUT MOSTLY IT TURNS OUT ALL
RIGHT, DOESN'T IT, PA?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.917
Charles: YEAH, MOSTLY. IF YOU
HAVE FAITH AND YOU WORK HARD.

10:25.084 --> 10:26.585
SPEAKING OF WORK,
I BETTER GET GOING.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.799
Charles: HAVE A NICE DAY.
Caroline: SAME To YOU.

10:31.966 --> 10:34.677
"WHOOPING COUGH...

10:34.844 --> 10:35.970
"AGUE...

10:37.847 --> 10:40.182
"COLIC, AND...

10:40.349 --> 10:42.226

10:42.393 --> 10:43.769
WHATEVER THAT IS.

10:43.936 --> 10:47.857
WELL, DR. BRISKIN'S HOMEOPATHIC
MEDICINE CURES IT ALL.

10:48.024 --> 10:49.191
ALL OF 'EM!

10:49.358 --> 10:51.485
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY CURE.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.195
YOU WOULD
IF YOU HAD IT.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.073
IMAGINE THE FAVOR WE WOULD
BE DOING TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE

10:56.240 --> 10:58.367
BY LETTING THEM BUY
THE MEDICINE FROM US,

10:58.534 --> 11:01.120
AND NOT TO MENTION
REVEREND ALDEN'S BIBLE.

11:01.287 --> 11:03.456
LAURA,
IT'S NOT OUR MONEY.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.041
BUT WE'LL BE DOUBLING IT.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.293
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

11:07.460 --> 11:08.544
LAURA...

11:08.711 --> 11:11.380
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT PA SAYS
ABOUT TAKING CHANCES.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.924
YOU JUST HAVE FAITH
AND WORK HARD,

11:14.091 --> 11:16.093
AND EVERYTHING
WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.595
HE SAID "MOSTLY."

11:17.762 --> 11:21.015
WELL, THERE'S TWO OF US,
AND THAT'S A LOT OF MOSTLY.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.811
GIVE ME THE CATALOG.

11:25.978 --> 11:26.979
WHAT FOR?

11:27.146 --> 11:28.481
I'VE GOT TO
FILL OUT THE ORDER,

11:28.647 --> 11:30.649
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW
TO SPELL HOMEOPATHIC.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.278
HOORAY! WAIT TILL REVEREND
ALDEN SEES HIS NEW BIBLE!

11:35.404 --> 11:37.531
[WHISTLE BLOWING]

11:59.345 --> 12:00.596
NOBODY WILL
FIND US HERE.

12:00.763 --> 12:01.847
HURRY UP.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.317
JIMINY!

12:13.484 --> 12:15.694
THEY SURE ARE PRETTY.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.363
THERE SURE ARE
A LOT OF THEM.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.824
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE
A LOT OF SICKNESSES.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.744
JUST MEANS WE'LL BE MEETING A LOT
OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CUSTOMERS.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.164
I HOPE WE FIND THEM BEFORE PA
FINDS OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.125
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.377
WE CAN GET THEM ALL SOLD
BEFORE ANYBODY KNOWS IT.

12:31.544 --> 12:32.420
BUT WHAT IF WE DON'T?

12:32.586 --> 12:33.921
DON'T WORRY.

12:34.088 --> 12:36.924
WE'RE HAVING FAITH AND TAKING
A CHANCE, LIKE PA SAYS.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.054
THERE'S A LOOSE BOARD
UP IN THE HAYLOFT.

12:42.221 --> 12:45.724
PA WILL NEVER FIND THE MEDICINES
IF WE HIDE THEM UP THERE.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.935
WRAP IT BACK UP.
TAKE 'EM ON HOME.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.207
HEY, MORNING, GIRLS.
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.333
MORNING PA!
MORNING, PA!

13:11.500 --> 13:12.376
HEY! HOLD IT, HOLD IT!
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:12.543 --> 13:13.461
IT'S TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.503
WE ALREADY ATE.

13:14.670 --> 13:15.546
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHORES?

13:15.713 --> 13:16.839
WE FINISHED EARLY.
BYE, PA!

13:17.006 --> 13:18.090
Mary: BYE!

13:32.771 --> 13:33.856
GOT IT.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.786
AREN'T THEY PRETTY?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.874
I THINK WE SHOULD DIVIDE
THE BOTTLES UP BETWEEN US.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.292
YOU MEAN GO ALONE?

13:53.459 --> 13:56.670
SURE. THAT WAY, YOU CAN MEET
TWICE AS MANY CUSTOMERS.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.464
WHAT DO WE DO IF
THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY?

13:58.631 --> 13:59.965
THEY WILL.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.134
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TELL
THEM WE HAVE THE MEDICINE,

14:02.301 --> 14:04.595
LIKE IT SAYS
IN THE CATALOG.

14:04.762 --> 14:05.804
OUR NEXT ORDER--

14:05.971 --> 14:07.306
OUR NEXT ORDER?

14:07.473 --> 14:09.350
YEAH,
OUR NEXT ORDER.

14:09.517 --> 14:12.311
WE PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

14:12.478 --> 14:13.646
THEY'LL JUST
COME TO US,

14:13.812 --> 14:15.564
JUST LIKE
THE MERCANTILE.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.817
AND THE MONEY FROM OUR
NEXT ORDER WILL BE FOR US.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.819
WE'LL MAKE MONEY
FOR CHRISTMAS,

14:20.986 --> 14:23.364
BIRTHDAYS,
AND EVERYTHING.

14:23.531 --> 14:26.283
WHICH SICKNESSES
DO YOU WANT?

14:26.450 --> 14:27.910
TOOTHACHE
AND EARACHE.

14:28.077 --> 14:30.704
A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE THOSE.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.081
I'LL TAKE THESE 3.

14:32.248 --> 14:33.374
WHAT ARE THEY?

14:35.334 --> 14:36.877
I CAN'T
PRONOUNCE THEM,

14:37.044 --> 14:38.170
BUT IF THE PEOPLE
HAVE THEM,

14:38.337 --> 14:39.547
I GUESS
THEY KNOW IT.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.340
LET'S HOPE SO.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.633
WE BETTER GET GOING,

14:42.800 --> 14:44.802
IF WE'RE GONNA GET
FINISHED BEFORE SUPPER.

14:44.969 --> 14:46.470
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.847
I'D LIKE TO GET HOME IN TIME
TO DO A LITTLE FISHING.

15:00.025 --> 15:00.818
OH!

15:00.985 --> 15:02.111
MARY!

15:02.278 --> 15:05.531
I DIDN'T SEE YOU STANDING THERE.
PARDON ME.

15:05.698 --> 15:07.366
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
MRS. FOSTER.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.450
YOU DIDN'T GET ME.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.535
THANK GOODNESS.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.120
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, MARY?

15:11.287 --> 15:12.204
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I CAME BY TO TELL YOU

15:12.371 --> 15:13.664
THAT MY SISTER AND I

15:13.831 --> 15:16.542
ARE SELLING DR. BRISKIN'S
HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES NOW,

15:16.709 --> 15:18.586
SO PEOPLE WON'T HAVE TO
ORDER THEM ANYMORE.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.045
THAT'S NICE, MARY.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.298
THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.882
YOU CAN GET THEM
RIGHT NOW.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.593
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WAIT ANYMORE.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.886
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.221
THIS ONE'S
FOR EARACHE,

15:29.388 --> 15:30.681
AND THIS ONE'S
FOR TOOTHACHE.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.850
WE HAVE MEDICINE FOR
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.

15:33.017 --> 15:34.101
JUST 25 CENTS.

15:35.019 --> 15:36.562
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
A TOOTHACHE,

15:36.729 --> 15:38.439
AND I DON'T HAVE
AN EARACHE.

15:38.606 --> 15:41.108
BUT IF ANYTHING COMES
UP, I'LL REMEMBER.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.651
HAVE A NICE DAY,
MARY.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.534
YES, MA'AM.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.828
Laura: DR. BRISKIN'S
HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES

15:52.995 --> 15:54.163
ARE KNOWN ALL OVER
THE WORLD.

15:54.330 --> 15:55.748
SAYS RIGHT HERE
ON THE LABEL.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.083
YEAH, THEN HOW COME I NEVER
HEARD OF 'EM, YOUNG LADY?

15:58.250 --> 15:59.084
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.294
MY SISTER AND I
ARE TELLING

16:00.461 --> 16:02.421
EVERYBODY AROUND
WALNUT GROVE ABOUT THEM,

16:02.588 --> 16:05.257
SO'S THEY CAN BUY
THEIR REMEDIES FROM US.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.259
"DYSPEPSIA,"

16:07.426 --> 16:08.427
AND "AGUE."

16:08.594 --> 16:10.763
DON'T RECKON I NEED
ANY MEDICINE FOR THAT.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.723
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THIS ONE?

16:12.890 --> 16:14.433
YOU BETTER PICK ONE
FAST, MA'AM,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.268
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT'LL BE WANTING THESE,

16:16.435 --> 16:17.936
AND WE ONLY HAVE
12 BOTTLES.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.773
I DON'T RECKON ANYONE IN MY
FAMILY'S EVER HAD THAT, EITHER.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.609
WELL, WE HAVE MIRACLE CURES
FOR ALMOST EVERY SICKNESS.

16:23.776 --> 16:25.944
IF YOU'LL JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU HAVE...

16:26.111 --> 16:28.656
BERTIE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.366
YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN TO DO THAT.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.951
YOU COULD MAKE
THOSE ANIMALS SICK.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.287
I DON'T THINK
THOSE PILLS WILL, MA'AM.

16:35.454 --> 16:36.955
WELL, YOU BETTER
HOPE THEY DON'T.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.624
MY HUSBAND'S GONNA
BE AWFUL UPSET

16:38.791 --> 16:40.292
IF HIS PIGS COME DOWN
WITH SOMETHING

16:40.459 --> 16:43.170
ON ACCOUNT OF THESE.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.797
YOU BETTER RUN ALONG.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.799
WHAT ABOUT MY PILLS?

16:46.965 --> 16:48.050
WHAT ABOUT 'EM?

16:48.217 --> 16:49.802
WELL, THE PIGS ATE THEM.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.179
THEY COST 25 CENTS.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.056
WELL, THE PIGS ATE 'EM.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.266
SEE IF YOU CAN GET 'EM
TO PAY FOR 'EM!

17:54.533 --> 17:57.369
OH, LAURA.
GLAD IT'S YOU.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.872
I WISH I WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.916
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AWFUL MAD, MARY.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.043
I DIDN'T SELL
ONE BOTTLE.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.545
ME, NEITHER.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.046
I GOT RID OF ONE.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.507
BILLY HOBSON FED IT
TO HIS PRIZE PIGS.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.427
DIDN'T THEY
PAY YOU FOR IT?

18:13.594 --> 18:15.554
SURE HOPE THOSE PIGS
DON'T GET SICK.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.389
MRS. HOBSON
WAS AWFUL MAD.

18:17.556 --> 18:18.557
OH, LAURA.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.892
WELL, IT WASN'T
MY FAULT.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.059
WELL, IT WAS
YOUR FAULT WE BOUGHT

18:21.226 --> 18:22.686
THIS MEDICINE
INSTEAD OF THE BIBLE.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.687
WELL, YOU
ORDERED THEM.

18:23.854 --> 18:24.980
WELL, YOU
TALKED ME INTO IT.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.190
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ME.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.568
YOU'RE OLDER THAN
I AM.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.445
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOUND
LIKE A VERY GOOD EXCUSE

18:31.612 --> 18:33.405
IF WE CAN'T SELL THEM.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.740
NOT ONE PERSON
I TALKED TO

18:34.907 --> 18:37.242
EVEN SOUNDED LIKE
THEY WERE INTERESTED.

18:37.409 --> 18:40.329
WE MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING WRONG.

18:40.496 --> 18:43.123
WE DID WHAT
THE CATALOG SAID.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.541
WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO TELL MORE PEOPLE

18:44.708 --> 18:46.293
AND TRY HARDER
NEXT TIME.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.171
MM-HMM.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.477
[JACK BARKING]

19:10.359 --> 19:11.443
HO!

19:16.573 --> 19:18.116
HELLO.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.577
FAUBUS IS THE NAME,
YOUNG LADY.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.955
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

19:23.121 --> 19:25.749
MY, WHAT LOVELY
CHILDREN YOU HAVE.

19:25.916 --> 19:26.834
THANK YOU.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
REMIND ME OF MY OWN.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.630
COURSE, THEY DON'T LIVE IN
A FINE PLACE LIKE THIS.

19:31.797 --> 19:33.131
THEIR MA BEING SICK
AND ALL,

19:33.298 --> 19:36.134
SHE CAN'T FIT THEM OUT
JUST LIKE SHE'D LIKE TO.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.845
SHE'S NOT WELL,
YOU KNOW.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.721
OH, I'M SORRY.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.098
WELL...

19:41.265 --> 19:44.393
GOD WILLING, I'LL MAKE
A FEW SALES THIS TRIP.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.145
YES, SO'S THAT I CAN GET
HER A PROPER DOCTOR.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.939
WHAT DO YOU SELL,
MISTER?

19:49.106 --> 19:52.317
OH, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT, LITTLE LADY.

19:52.484 --> 19:55.487
INDIAN MEDICINE JEWELRY
IS WHAT I SELL.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.155
A BEAUTY TO THE EYE,

19:57.322 --> 20:01.159
AND A BOON TO THE HEALTH,
ALL FOR ONLY 25 CENTS.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.079
UH, WELL, THEY'RE
VERY NICE, I'M SURE,

20:04.246 --> 20:06.123
BUT WE REALLY
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.836
TRUTH IS, MA'AM,

20:11.003 --> 20:12.212
I UNDERSTAND.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.092
FACT IS,

20:17.259 --> 20:18.886
A MAN WHO AIN'T SEEN
FOOD IN TWO DAYS

20:19.052 --> 20:23.015
KNOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO
COME BY A SILVER COIN.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.142
TWO DAYS?

20:25.309 --> 20:28.478
I LEFT MY PROVISIONS FOR
THE YOUNG'UNS, BLESS THEM.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.607
WELL, LET'S PRAY GOD
I GET BACK BEFORE--

20:31.773 --> 20:32.691
NO! WAIT A MINUTE.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.526
YOU CANNOT WORK
WITHOUT EATING.

20:34.693 --> 20:35.861
NOW, WE HAVE PLENTY.

20:36.028 --> 20:39.072
NO, NO, NO, NO. I
REFUSE TO TAKE CHARITY.

20:39.239 --> 20:44.536
UH, BUT, IF YOU'D CONSIDER
25 CENTS AN ADEQUATE PRICE

20:44.703 --> 20:46.538
FOR SOME BEANS
FOR MY PAIL.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.540
AND, UH, MAYBE
SOME WATER,

20:48.707 --> 20:50.792
IT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS PRICE.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.546
BESIDES, WE HAVE STEW,
HOT COFFEE, AND CORN BREAD.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.049
IT'S ALL READY.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.301
YOU ARE TOO
GENEROUS, MA'AM.

21:27.996 --> 21:28.830
HI, EVERYBODY.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.666
Girls: HI, PA.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.709
WASN'T THAT MR. FAUBUS
I SAW LEAVING JUST NOW?

21:32.876 --> 21:34.920
WHY, YES. YOU KNOW
THAT POOR MAN?

21:35.087 --> 21:36.338
YOU DIDN'T BUY
ANYTHING FROM HIM?

21:36.505 --> 21:37.464
NO. AS A MATTER
OF FACT,

21:37.631 --> 21:39.049
HE BOUGHT
SOMETHING FROM ME.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.592
OH, YEAH?
WHAT HE'D BUY?

21:40.759 --> 21:41.843
SUPPER.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.011
HE PAID MA 25 CENTS

21:43.178 --> 21:45.138
FOR SOME STEW,
CORNBREAD, AND COFFEE.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.101
YOU MEAN HE GAVE YOU
25 CENTS IN CASH?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.143
WELL, NOT EXACTLY--

21:50.310 --> 21:51.812
LET ME TELL YOU--
HE TRADED YOU.

21:51.979 --> 21:54.189
A STRING WITH SOME
BUCKEYES ON IT?

21:54.356 --> 21:55.607
UH, A NECKLACE, YES.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.109
[LAUGHING]

21:57.275 --> 21:59.319
DON'T FEEL BAD. EDWARDS
GAVE HIM HIS SHOES TODAY.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.239
WELL, CHARLES, I DON'T THINK IT'S
FUNNY WHEN A POOR MAN LIKE THAT--

22:02.406 --> 22:03.281
CAROLINE,
HE'S NOT A POOR MAN.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.075
HE DOESN'T
HAVE A FAMILY.

22:05.242 --> 22:06.785
HE JUST TELLS THAT STORY
TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY THINGS

22:06.952 --> 22:08.036
FROM HIM OR TRADE WITH HIM.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.121
Caroline:
WELL, I NEVER...

22:09.287 --> 22:10.789
Charles: I TOLD YOU
NOT To BE UPSET.

22:10.956 --> 22:12.958
YOU RAN INTO
THE WORLD'S BEST SALESMAN.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.460
I'LL--HA HA--
UNHITCH THE TEAM.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.476
Laura: MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL
YOUR HOMEWORK DONE IN SCHOOL

22:31.643 --> 22:34.021
SO WE CAN START
SELLING RIGHT AFTER.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.564
Mary: WELL, YOU MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T BREAK THOSE BOTTLES

22:35.731 --> 22:36.982
PLAYING IN
THE SCHOOLYARD.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.610
I WON'T. SURE HOPE
WE BROUGHT ENOUGH.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.822
WE'LL BE SURE TO SELL SOME
TODAY NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW.

22:43.989 --> 22:46.074
TALKING ABOUT THE WAY MR.
FAUBUS DOES IT,

22:46.241 --> 22:47.284
I'M NOT SURE.

22:47.451 --> 22:48.702
SOUNDS LIKE
CHEATING TO ME.

22:48.869 --> 22:49.661
IT'S NOT CHEATING.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.163
THEN IT'S LYING.

22:51.329 --> 22:54.583
NOT IF YOU'RE THE BEST
SALESMAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

22:54.750 --> 22:56.585
LIKE PA SAYS.

22:56.752 --> 23:00.839
PEOPLE BUY BETTER IF YOU
TELL THEM A SAD STORY.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.425
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.

23:03.592 --> 23:04.843
WELL, ALMOST.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.011
HERE. TAKE THESE.

23:06.178 --> 23:07.179
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.347
MAYBE I CAN SELL SOME
BEFORE SCHOOL. BYE.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.557
BYE.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.595
HERE. LET ME
HELP YOU WITH THAT.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.807
OH! WELL,
I THANK YOU, CHILD.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.226
CARRYING HEAVY STUFF SURE MUST
MAKE YOUR BODY ACHE.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.144
OH!

23:56.311 --> 23:59.064
MY PA SURE IS TAKEN
WITH THE RHEUMATISM.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.566
HE CAN HARDLY WORK.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.276
MY MA ISN'T
MUCH BETTER, EITHER.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.070
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

24:05.237 --> 24:07.697
ALL A BODY CAN DO
JUST TO GET AROUND

24:07.864 --> 24:10.951
WHEN THEY'RE DOWN
IN THEIR BACK.

24:12.661 --> 24:13.870
THAT'S FINE.

24:14.037 --> 24:14.955
I KNOW.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.873
THANK YOU, DEAR.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.336
MY PA SAYS THAT THE ONLIEST
THING THAT HELPS HIM

24:21.503 --> 24:24.256
IS DR. BRISKIN'S
HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.766
OH, MY, YES!

24:34.933 --> 24:38.687
MY SISTER AND I ARE
SELLING IT TO PEOPLE...

24:38.854 --> 24:43.191
JUST SO'S WE COULD
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

24:43.358 --> 24:46.194
OH, THAT'S A DEAR THING
YOU'RE DOING, MY CHILD.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.447
I WISH SOMEONE CARED ENOUGH
FOR ME TO DO SOME WORK.

24:49.614 --> 24:52.701
NOTHING EVER GETS DONE
AROUND HERE UNLESS BY ME.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.623
BUT DR. BRISKIN'S REMEDY CAN
MAKE YOUR WORK A LOT EASIER,

24:58.790 --> 25:00.876
AND IT ONLY COSTS
25 CENTS.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.712
OH! A FORTUNE.

25:03.879 --> 25:05.630
WORTH IT, I'M SURE,

25:05.797 --> 25:08.884
BUT IT WOULD TAKE ME A YEAR
TO PUT THAT MUCH BACK.

25:09.050 --> 25:13.972
NO. I'LL JUST HAVE TO GO ALONG
WITH THE PAIN IN MY BONES.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.432
IT'S MY BURDEN TO CARRY

25:15.599 --> 25:19.686
BECAUSE NO ONE CARES FOR ME.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.897

25:30.488 --> 25:35.452
NO. NO ONE WHO CARES
25 CENTS' WORTH.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.996
REMEMBER THAT, CHILD.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.727
WELL, SHE WAS
SO PITIFUL.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.419
UH-HUH. I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY IT DID.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.379
YOU DIDN'T TELL
YOUR PARENTS, DID YOU?

27:09.546 --> 27:10.755
OH, NO, WE DIDN'T.

27:10.922 --> 27:14.259
YOU BETTER HAVE
A GOOD HIDING PLACE.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.916
LET ME FEEL
YOUR HEADS.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.335
DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY FEVER.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.087
OPEN YOUR MOUTH
WIDE.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.130
AH. WIDER.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.548
AH.

39:00.715 --> 39:02.633
THEY LOOK
ALL RIGHT TO ME.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.719
I'M AWFUL SICK, PA.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.095
ME, TOO.

39:06.262 --> 39:08.681
WE JUST CAN'T
GO TO CHURCH, PA.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.809
WE HAVE LARUNGEETIS.

39:11.976 --> 39:13.561
YOU HAVE WHAT?

39:13.728 --> 39:15.563
Mary: LARANGUTUS.

39:15.730 --> 39:19.525
Charles:
LARANGUTUS?

39:19.692 --> 39:23.863
HOW LONG YOU THINK THIS
"LARANGUTUS" IS GONNA LAST?

39:24.030 --> 39:27.825
WE NEED A FEW MORE HOURS
TO GET OVER IT, PA.

39:27.992 --> 39:29.452
WELL, MAYBE BY THE TIME
MA AND CARRIE AND I

39:29.618 --> 39:30.494
GET BACK FROM CHURCH,

39:30.661 --> 39:32.538
YOU'LL BE
FEELING BETTER THEN.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.498
I'M SURE
WE WILL, PA.

39:34.665 --> 39:37.293
WE JUST HAVE TO GET
OUR STRENGTH BACK.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.336
YEAH.

39:39.503 --> 39:41.130
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S PRONOUNCED "LARYNGITIS,"

39:41.297 --> 39:42.631
AND IT MEANS
YOU CAN'T TALK.

39:45.426 --> 39:46.385
NOW, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

39:46.552 --> 39:48.554
WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO TO CHURCH?

39:48.721 --> 39:50.473
COME ON. YOU CERTAINLY
CAN TALK, SO TELL ME.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.895
PLEASE, PA. WE COULDN'T
FACE REVEREND ALDEN.

39:56.062 --> 39:58.689
WELL, WHAT'S THE REVEREND
ALDEN GOT TO DO WITH IT?

39:58.856 --> 40:02.026
WELL, YOU SEE, TODAY
BEING HIS BIRTHDAY,

40:02.193 --> 40:04.695
WE WERE GOING
TO SURPRISE HIM.

40:04.862 --> 40:08.365
[CRYING] NOBODY
WANTED THE MEDICINE.

40:08.532 --> 40:10.034
WHAT MEDICINE?

40:10.201 --> 40:12.912
THE MEDICINE WE BOUGHT
IN THE CATALOG.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.706
WE TRIED TO SELL IT
TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY

40:15.873 --> 40:18.584
SO WE COULD GET HIM
A GRAND BIBLE.

40:18.751 --> 40:20.002
[CRYING]

40:20.169 --> 40:22.088
WELL, WHERE DID YOU GET THE
MONEY TO BUY THE MEDICINE?

40:24.548 --> 40:26.759
COME ON.

40:26.926 --> 40:28.844
IT'S THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL FUND.

40:31.347 --> 40:33.641
Laura: IT WAS MY FAULT, PA.

40:33.808 --> 40:36.018
I SAW IT FIRST.

40:36.185 --> 40:38.437
BUT I WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE MONEY,

40:38.604 --> 40:40.106
AND I WROTE
THE LETTER.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.236
Laura: WE JUST WANTED
TO GET REVEREND ALDEN

40:45.402 --> 40:48.697
THE BEST BIBLE THAT WE COULD.

40:48.864 --> 40:51.826
PLEASE, PA. WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO DO IT.

40:54.411 --> 40:57.957
DON'T BE MAD AT MARY.
PLEASE, PA.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.170
I THINK YOU TWO
BETTER GET DRESSED.

41:03.337 --> 41:04.672
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE LATE FOR CHURCH.

41:04.839 --> 41:05.589
BUT, PA..

41:05.756 --> 41:06.590
THERE'S NO BUTS
ABOUT IT.

41:06.757 --> 41:07.675
NOW, YOU MADE
A MISTAKE,

41:07.842 --> 41:10.594
AND YOU'RE
GONNA OWN UP TO IT.

41:10.761 --> 41:12.054
I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

41:19.145 --> 41:20.271
AND THIS WON'T BE EASY
FOR YOU,

41:20.437 --> 41:23.440
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE
WHAT YOU DID FOREVER.

41:23.607 --> 41:24.775
GO ON, GET READY.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.666
MORNING, REVEREND.

41:42.126 --> 41:43.669
WELL, GOOD MORNING.

41:43.836 --> 41:45.963
YOU'RE A BIT EARLY. SERVICES
AREN'T FOR 30 MINUTES.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.882
NO, NO. I KNOW THAT. MARY
AND LAURA HAD SOMETHING

41:48.048 --> 41:49.925
THEY WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

41:50.092 --> 41:51.177
Alden: WELL, YOU CAME AT
A GOOD TIME, GIRLS.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.720
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
AND SIT DOWN?

41:56.182 --> 41:56.974
AREN'T YOU COMING?

41:57.141 --> 41:57.975
NO, THIS IS
SOMETHING

41:58.142 --> 41:59.268
YOU HAVE TO
DO BY YOURSELVES.

41:59.435 --> 42:01.604
I'LL BE OUTSIDE WITH YOUR MOM.
GO ON.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.988
Alden: OH, MY.
SUCH LONG FACES.

42:24.335 --> 42:25.669
Charles: I FEEL
KIND OF SORRY FOR THEM.

42:25.836 --> 42:27.171
THEY REALLY LOOK SCARED.

42:30.507 --> 42:34.178
THIS IS WHAT YOU BOUGHT WITH THE
SUNDAY-SCHOOL TREASURY MONEY?

42:34.345 --> 42:35.471
YES, SIR.

42:36.847 --> 42:37.806
THE MONEY WAS IN YOUR CARE.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.434
YOU WERE INSTRUCTED
TO BUY A BIBLE.

42:40.601 --> 42:43.312
I TALKED HER INTO TRYING TO
GET A BETTER ONE, THAT'S WHY.

42:43.479 --> 42:44.521
IT WAS MY FAULT.

42:44.688 --> 42:46.232
IT WAS NOT, MARY.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.067
Alden: I SUSPECT YOU BOTH
HAD A PART IN IT.

42:50.236 --> 42:53.155
THE QUESTION IS, HAVE YOU LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM THIS MISTAKE?

42:53.322 --> 42:55.407
Both: YES, SIR.

42:55.574 --> 42:56.784
Alden: YOU'RE SURE?

42:56.951 --> 42:59.870
WE WON'T DO IT AGAIN, REVEREND.
NEVER.

43:00.037 --> 43:01.330
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

43:01.497 --> 43:02.581
NOT EVER.

43:10.714 --> 43:12.216
I'D LIKE YOU
TO LEAVE THIS WITH ME.

43:14.802 --> 43:17.137
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
JOIN YOUR PARENTS NOW?

43:17.304 --> 43:19.098
Both: YES, SIR. THANK YOU.

43:32.194 --> 43:33.028
HARRIET!

43:33.195 --> 43:33.904
YES?

43:34.071 --> 43:35.030
WOULD YOU HURRY UP?

43:35.197 --> 43:36.490
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LATE FOR CHURCH!

43:36.657 --> 43:37.992
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,
WOULD YOU STOP BELLOWING?

43:38.158 --> 43:40.119
I'M COMING.
CHILDREN!

43:40.286 --> 43:41.912
COME ON. COME ON. HURRY UP, NOW.
LET'S GO.

43:42.079 --> 43:44.999
NOT YET. WE HAVEN'T WRAPPED
REVEREND ALDEN'S BIBLE.

43:45.165 --> 43:45.916
WHY NOT?

43:46.083 --> 43:47.251
WE WANTED TO
SHOW IT TO YOU.

43:47.418 --> 43:50.254
YES. SEE?
HIS NAME IN GOLD.

43:50.421 --> 43:54.883
I KNOW IT'LL BE HIS BEST PRESENT
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.093
YES, WELL,
I'M SURE THE LORD

43:56.260 --> 43:57.594
WILL TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION

43:57.761 --> 43:59.054
WHEN HE LISTENS
TO PRAYERS.

43:59.221 --> 44:00.472
Harriet: OH, NELS.

44:10.607 --> 44:12.609
WELCOME.

44:12.776 --> 44:15.195
GOOD MORNING.

44:15.362 --> 44:20.034
THE SERMON FOR TODAY
IS ON THE GIFT OF LOVE.

44:20.200 --> 44:23.954
NOW, THERE ONCE WAS A MAN THAT
WANTED TO SHOW HIS LOVE FOR A FRIEND

44:24.121 --> 44:26.081
BY GMNG HIM A GIFT.

44:26.248 --> 44:31.962
AND THIS MAN WAS RICH IN LOVE,
BUT HE WAS POOR IN WORLDLY GOODS

44:32.129 --> 44:33.839
AND WHEN HE WENT HOME
AND COUNTED HIS MONEY,

44:34.006 --> 44:36.800
HE FOUND THAT HE
COULDN'T PURCHASE THE GIFT

44:36.967 --> 44:38.093
THAT HE THOUGHT
TO GIVE HIS FRIEND,

44:38.260 --> 44:39.428
AND HE WAS SAD.

44:41.430 --> 44:43.515
AND HIS SADNESS WAS FELT
BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM.

44:45.976 --> 44:49.980
BUT THEN HE DECIDED HE'D
PLANT A CROP FOR HIS FRIEND,

44:50.147 --> 44:51.398
BUT THAT, TOO, FAILED.

44:53.067 --> 44:55.778
THE MAN WAS HEARTBROKEN.

44:55.944 --> 45:00.491
BUT WHEN THE FRIEND HEARD OF
WHAT HE HAD ENDURED FOR HIM,

45:00.657 --> 45:03.118
HE WAS OVERCOME.

45:03.285 --> 45:06.747
HE EMBRACED THE MAN AND HE WEPT.

45:08.999 --> 45:10.542
FOR IT WAS NOT
THE GIFT THAT COUNTED.

45:12.669 --> 45:14.755
IT WAS THE LOVE THAT WAS
IN THE MAN'S HEART.

45:24.681 --> 45:26.725
THIS OLD BIBLE WAS USED
BY MY FATHER.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.396
HE GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

45:32.815 --> 45:36.026
OVER THE YEARS,
I'VE ACQUIRED MANY BIBLES.

45:36.193 --> 45:38.112
NEWER BIBLES, FANCIER BIBLES.

45:39.488 --> 45:41.907
WHEN YOU'RE A MINISTER,
EVERYONE GIVES YOU A BIBLE.

45:42.074 --> 45:43.951
[LAUGHTER]

45:44.118 --> 45:48.080
BUT THIS PARTICULAR BIBLE
IS VERY PRECIOUS TO ME.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.834
THE COVER'S WORN,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.168
THE PAGES ARE YELLOWED...

45:54.795 --> 45:58.924
BUT THAT DOESN'T SUBTRACT FROM THE
INSPIRATION THAT'S WITHIN IT.

46:01.844 --> 46:03.429
THIS OLD BIBLE'S LIKE LOVE.

46:05.222 --> 46:06.932
THE OLDER IT GETS,
THE BETTER IT BECOMES

46:07.099 --> 46:08.642
BECAUSE IT'S SO PRECIOUS TO ME.

46:10.561 --> 46:14.148
TODAY'S MY BIRTHDAY,
AND I HAVE RECEIVED

46:14.314 --> 46:17.276
A VERY SPECIAL GIFT FROM
OUR SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN...

46:20.863 --> 46:21.947
THIS CASE.

46:23.657 --> 46:26.368
NOW, HOW DID THEY KNOW THAT
I'D ALWAYS WANTED A CASE

46:26.535 --> 46:28.954
TO CARRY MY FAVORITE BIBLE
AND KEEP IT SAFE?

46:31.415 --> 46:33.125
THIS ONE'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

46:35.085 --> 46:37.921
I'LL ALWAYS CHERISH IT

46:38.088 --> 46:40.883
BECAUSE IT COMES FROM
CHILDREN I CHERISH

46:41.049 --> 46:43.427
AND WILL NOW CONTAIN
A GIFT FROM MY FATHER.

46:47.222 --> 46:48.390
AND TO ALL OF YOU...

46:50.851 --> 46:53.312
LOVE EACH OTHER.

46:53.479 --> 46:54.730
CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

46:57.483 --> 46:58.609
FORGIVE EACH OTHER'S
MISTAKES,

46:58.775 --> 47:02.029
AND WE'LL ALL
BE BOUND CLOSER TOGETHER.

47:02.196 --> 47:05.157
FOR, LIKE THIS CASE
AND THIS OLD BIBLE,

47:05.324 --> 47:06.283
IT'S THE GIFT OF LOVE

47:06.450 --> 47:09.161
THAT'S THE GREATEST GIFT
OF ALL.

47:11.288 --> 47:12.456
NOW, WOULD YOU ALL JOIN ME
