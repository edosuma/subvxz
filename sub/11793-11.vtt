00:12.278 --> 00:16.349
  Stevie's coming!
  I still can't believe it.
  I'm going to die.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.751
 So dramatic.

00:17.784 --> 00:20.520
  Dramatic? She's going to sing
  the very song,
  from the very stage,

00:20.553 --> 00:22.422
 from which her very career
 was launched.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.391
Very exciting.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.394
 Just remember, Mikey, Stevie's
 all mine.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.430
 In your dreams, Zack.
 Stevie's 17.

00:30.463 --> 00:33.400
She goes out for
older guys like
River Phoenix.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.668
  How would you know?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.403
   I'm the president
   of her fan club.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.773
   I read it in this month's
   confidential newsletter.

00:39.806 --> 00:43.276
  Yeah, confidential to all
  500,000 members.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.478
  Hey, everybody, I think she's
  coming.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.385
Guess my new toothpaste
really works.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.756
  This is really intense.
  What's going down?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.324
   We're all waiting for...

00:58.858 --> 01:00.126
Stevie!

01:01.161 --> 01:02.762
 ( bell rings )

01:02.796 --> 01:06.066
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.635
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:11.471
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

01:11.504 --> 01:15.342
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

01:15.375 --> 01:19.179
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:20.847 --> 01:23.717
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:27.120
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:27.153 --> 01:30.090
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:33.526
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:38.098

01:51.745 --> 01:54.748

01:54.781 --> 01:57.784
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:57.817 --> 02:01.554
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

02:07.694 --> 02:10.697
  Carrie: <i>3:15 p.m.,</i>
 <i>school's out.</i>

02:10.729 --> 02:13.133
 <i>The classrooms are empty,</i>
 <i>the halls are empty,</i>

02:13.166 --> 02:15.602
   <i>and I'm running on empty.</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:18.905
  <i>It's a chance to</i>
  <i>organize my lesson</i>
  <i>plans for tomorrow,</i>

02:18.938 --> 02:22.409
 <i>and catch a few quiet moments</i>
 <i>for myself.</i>

02:23.176 --> 02:24.511
Nikki: You lost the bet!

02:24.544 --> 02:25.979
  I did not!

02:26.079 --> 02:27.080
 Yes, you did.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.716
I said I would kiss Stevie,
and I did.

02:29.749 --> 02:34.187
  That didn't count! You kissed
  her poster, you pervert.

02:34.220 --> 02:37.157
 Miss Bliss,
 will you settle this?

02:37.190 --> 02:39.159
  There's really
  nothing to settle.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.795
Gambling's not allowed
in the school.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.962
   Remember?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.097
Both: You bet.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.534
   Miss Bliss, it's not
   really gambling.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.202
  I bet Nikki that
  if I kissed Stevie

02:49.235 --> 02:52.172
  she would have to wash
  my gym clothes for a year.

02:52.205 --> 02:56.443
 I don't normally
 condone betting,
 but, Zack, I'll take as much

02:56.476 --> 02:58.111
 of that action as I can get.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.815
We'll see who washes
whose laundry.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.957
 Help, there's a kid trying to
 get me to autograph
 his fly collection.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.560
Hi, Miss Bliss.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.129
Colleen Morton.

03:16.162 --> 03:19.466
 It's great to see you again!

03:19.499 --> 03:22.869
  Colleen! No one calls me that
  anymore. It feels good.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.404
 Look at you!

03:24.437 --> 03:25.739
You've changed.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.907
   I know, I'm not as wild
   as I used to be.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.478
   No, I mean...
   I mean you look adorable.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.514
 Uh-oh, my manager says I'm
 only supposed to be adorable

03:34.547 --> 03:35.915
  to people under 21.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.418
Sit down for a minute.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.890
I got your letters from all
over the world.

03:43.923 --> 03:47.093
  Where in your busy schedule
  did you find time to write?

03:47.093 --> 03:50.797
  Be real, Miss Bliss, you
  don't forget your friends.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.799
 So, where are you staying?
 With your folks?

03:52.832 --> 03:55.669
 Oh, no. At a hotel. My parents
 don't live here anymore.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.103
   I bought them a house
   out on the coast.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.406
  It's the old
  Vanna White estate.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.509
   Well, in that case, I insist
   that you stay at the old

04:02.542 --> 04:04.577
 Carrie Bliss estate.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.747
 And the best part of it is
 you don't have to buy a vowel.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.618
   Look who's here.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.119
Stevie!

04:13.153 --> 04:15.555
 Hello, Mr. Spalding!

04:15.588 --> 04:18.091
  It's Belding. But you can
  call me Richard.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.560
 I called you
 Richard when I was
 going to school here,

04:20.593 --> 04:22.729
   and you sent me to detention
   for a week.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.069
 Excuse me. Stevie, this is
 Mylo Williams.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.507
 I'm a fan of yours.
 I love your records.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.544
  Especially that one about
  holding hands in the Buick.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.645
  What depth!

04:41.147 --> 04:46.086
 Mr. Belding, Stevie has a
 wonderful idea about her song
 for the concert film.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.154
   Lay it upon me, I'm hip.

04:48.188 --> 04:53.893
  I would like to
  sing my song to
  one special person at JFK.

04:53.927 --> 04:59.099
 Oh, really? What a great idea!
 I am flattered.

04:59.132 --> 05:04.437
 Uh, I think Stevie had someone
 a little younger in mind.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.072
Like a student.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.110
Oh, no, I see.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.912
 Oh, don't be bummed,
 you'll always
 be someone very special to me,

05:12.946 --> 05:14.614
 Mr. Spelling.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.720
   Great news,
   Nikki, Miss Paladrino
   asked me to pick somebody

05:20.754 --> 05:23.156
to interview Stevie for the
school newspaper.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.557
 So, who did you pick?

05:24.591 --> 05:25.825
  Me!

05:25.859 --> 05:28.395
  I bet you almost fainted when
  you found out.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.964
   I'll be lucky if
I have the guts
   to open my mouth.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.132
 Come with me?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.667
Oh, I don't know, Lisa.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.068
Please, Nikki.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.170
 You know,
 interviewing Stevie's
 not really my thing.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.972
 Do it for me.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.107
  I'll give you
  the olives off my
  next pizza.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.113
Little Colleen Morton.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.615
  Isn't life amazing?

05:48.648 --> 05:51.618
I know. I can't believe
what's happened to her.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.754
  Well, I can. I saw it when
  she was in my music class.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.424
  The way that girl belted out,
  "This Land is Your Land,"

05:57.457 --> 06:00.360
   I wanted to write
   her a rent check.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.729
 You know what I've noticed
 since she's been
 staying at my house?

06:02.762 --> 06:03.797
 What?

06:03.830 --> 06:06.566
 Success hasn't
 spoiled her one bit.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.768
  She's still just
  a sloppy teenager.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.672
Does anybody else know
she's staying with you?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.774
No, you're
the only one I've told.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.644
  My lips are sealed.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.048
   Hey, Nikki, did you see
   the headlines in
   the school paper?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.453
  <i>Stevie to pick gunk</i>
  <i>for concert flick.</i>

06:26.486 --> 06:27.854
 Gunk?

06:27.887 --> 06:31.891
   No, hunk. The print shop ran
   out of capital H's.

06:31.925 --> 06:37.664
Oh, looking for a hunk?
Then I've got three days
to pump me up.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.066
  Oh, please.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.736
   So, what's the big deal?

06:42.769 --> 06:45.405
 She's going to sing a song
 to a guy on stage.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.107
And that's how I'm going to
get my kiss.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.308
   I'm going to be that guy.

06:48.341 --> 06:52.078
 She won't be able to say no
 when the camera's are rolling.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.081
 Why is she going to pick you?
 I mean, there are
 hundreds of other

06:55.081 --> 06:56.983
  guys drooling for a chance.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.520
 Yeah, but I'll be the only guy
 without drool on my chin.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.088
She'll love me.

07:02.122 --> 07:06.826
 Geez, this Stevie is some
 manipulator. She'll do
 anything for some publicity.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.764
   That's not true!
   I happen to know she
   hates personal publicity.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.767
She said so on <i>Oprah,</i>
<i>Carson, Geraldo</i>
and <i>Letterman.</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:25.345
I just got
accepted as a freshman
at Notre Dame.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.147
   That's wonderful!

07:27.180 --> 07:28.415
  Oh!

07:28.448 --> 07:30.917
  When did you decide to go
  to college?

07:30.950 --> 07:35.155
Well,
I think it was in the 43rd
city of a 38-day tour.

07:35.188 --> 07:39.059
 I was either in New Guinea
 or New Jersey!

07:39.059 --> 07:40.460
   You mean you didn't know
   where you were?

07:40.493 --> 07:42.862
 No, I didn't know who I was.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.965
 I think college
 is a good place
  to find out.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.336
So, what is going to happen
with your career?

07:49.369 --> 07:52.072
 That's what my manager,
 my agents,
 my accountants, and my lawyers

07:52.072 --> 07:53.340
 keep asking.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.507
What'll you tell them?

07:54.541 --> 07:57.977
   <i>* Cheer, cheer, for old</i>
   <i>Notre Dame *</i>

07:58.078 --> 08:01.247
 That's great.
 I'm so proud of you.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.718
  I'm so happy!
  But it's happening
  so quickly.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.853
I just wish my parents were
here to help.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.156
Well, I'm here.
You can lean on me.
I'll take their place.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.925
 That's cool!
 Can I borrow the car?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.126
  No.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.295
  You really have
  taken their place.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.165
 Come on,
 Lisa, you're taking all day!

08:19.199 --> 08:21.134
 Let me look at that
 fan club newsletter.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.037
   Hold on,
   I'll find you something.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.039
How about this.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.675
 "Stevie's favorite snack is
 carob-covered yogurt balls."

08:28.708 --> 08:33.113
   Wow,
   that's what I feed my flies.
   Makes their wings shiney.

08:33.145 --> 08:37.283
 Give me something better.
 I need a clue into her
 innermost thoughts.

08:37.317 --> 08:42.087
 Well, she loves charities,
 stray animals,
 and lost causes.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.923
   Then I'm perfect!

08:45.859 --> 08:49.162
 How far lost does a cause have
 to be before
 she gets involved?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.398
 Only the most
 desperate situations.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.801
 Earthquake relief,
 world hunger,
 children's hospitals.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.703
 Ding!

08:56.736 --> 08:59.172
   ( coughs ) You know,
   Lisa, I'm not
   feeling too well.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.107
   I think I better
   go see my doctor.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.009
  You don't look well.
  Your hair's messed.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.010
 What?

09:07.814 --> 09:08.882
Can I help you?

09:08.915 --> 09:10.383
 It's me, Mr. Spelding.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.119
   Oh, Stevie,
   what a pleasant surprise.

09:13.153 --> 09:18.391
 Oh, I really hate
 to ask you this,
 but Mrs. Spelding... I mean,

09:18.425 --> 09:22.128
  Mrs. Belding has
  been hounding me
  and hounding me, so

09:22.162 --> 09:25.732
 could you just sign
 this poster for her?

09:26.299 --> 09:27.434
  No problem.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.735
 Who should I make it out to?

09:28.768 --> 09:30.704
   Richard.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.205
   She'll get a real
   kick out of that!

09:38.845 --> 09:39.879
Thanks!

09:41.247 --> 09:42.782
  Now, what can I do for you?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.317
   I picked the boy I'm
   going to sing to.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.819
 Oh, wonderful.
 Who's the lucky dude?

09:45.852 --> 09:50.824
 He's not so lucky. His doctor
 sent this letter to my
 manager at the hotel.

09:50.857 --> 09:55.261
 Poor kid. Can you imagine, his
 last request is
 that I sing to him?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.697
 Last request?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.166
   Are you saying that some boy
   in my school is dying?

10:00.200 --> 10:03.103
 Yes. So,
 how can I think of picking
 anyone else?

10:06.306 --> 10:09.909
"My patient's
last request is that
you sing a song to him.

10:09.943 --> 10:14.414
   "Perhaps this
   could prolong his life
   for a few precious days.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.952
   "P.S.
   Don't be afraid to kiss him,
   he's not contagious."

10:18.985 --> 10:23.123
   I can't believe
   that Zack Morris
   is dying.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.726
   Just imagine
   the fear our forefathers
   must have felt,

10:26.760 --> 10:30.764
  leaving their homes
  for parts unknown.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.969
 What do you think it was that
 sustained the pioneers through
 their darkest times?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.737
 Night lights?

10:37.771 --> 10:41.875
 PA: <i>Attention please, we now</i>
 <i>have the name of</i>
 <i>the courageous young man</i>

10:41.908 --> 10:44.277
<i>who's been</i>
<i>selected to be onstage</i>
<i>with Stevie.</i>

10:46.146 --> 10:50.016
 So, Zack Morris, if it's not
 too much trouble,
 please come to my office.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.151
  All right!

10:52.385 --> 10:55.188
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

10:56.523 --> 11:01.728
 Congratulations, Zack. You won
 against incredible odds.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.096
  What's your secret.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.264
 Born lucky, I guess.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.966
 How did you pull this one off?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.069
 What did you do? Tell them
 you were dying?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.908
   Freeze! Not another step.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.242
   All right,
   let's see your hall pass.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.744
  I don't have one. I was...

11:17.777 --> 11:18.912
Cutting class!

11:18.945 --> 11:20.714
   Zack, you're a dead man.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.416
   Oh, no, not yet.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.452
   Zack, son, I understand.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.820
 Stevie showed me the letter.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.289
  ( coughs )

11:29.322 --> 11:32.125
   Well, we all gotta
   go sometime, sir.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.195
 Excuse me? Are we going
 to bury him for breaking
 the rules or not?

11:35.228 --> 11:37.263
   Mylo, x-nay on the ury-bay.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.470
  ( whispering ) Zack is dying.
  So be nice to him.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.338
   Say what?

11:49.142 --> 11:53.146
 Zack, I'm sorry, man.
 I'm sorry.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.118
 Mr. Belding?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.820
 I want you to know how much
 this means to me to be
 even a small part

12:00.854 --> 12:02.255
 in Stevie's farewell.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.057
 What pluck, what inspiration.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.293
  And, sir,
  I don't want it to get out.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.964
  People might
  treat me special, and,
  well, I wouldn't want that.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.565
 I understand.

12:12.599 --> 12:17.804
 And if it's any comfort to
 you, I am removing every black
 mark on your record.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.707
 Well,
 I hope you have a big eraser.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.911
 Hey, guys, what's happening?

12:24.944 --> 12:27.247
It's... It's...

12:27.280 --> 12:29.416
   Stevie, it's really you.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.085
I guess it is.
You must be Lisa
Turtle.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.086
You're awesome.

12:33.887 --> 12:34.921
 And you're...

12:36.823 --> 12:40.960
 Nikki!
 She'll be fine. Right, Nikki?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.862
 It helps if you
 remember to breathe.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.930
It's an old rock
and roll trick.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.303
  See, not only is she awesome,
  she's smart. Total person.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.174
 So, Stevie,
 I guess the big question
 all your fans want to know is,

12:54.207 --> 12:56.209
 why are you quitting?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.345
  Well,
  I'm not quitting-quitting.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.146
   I'm just chilling
   out for a while.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.282
  A college education is really
  important.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.150
   I mean,
   singing isn't everything.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.453
Are you crazy!

13:06.486 --> 13:10.423
 What you do on that stage is
 important. You just can't
 chill out on us.

13:10.457 --> 13:15.061
 We love you. We need you.
 Don't do this to us.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.064
 If you're through
 with your nervous
 breakdown, I'd like to move on

13:18.064 --> 13:20.433
 to more important questions.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.970
Stevie, what do you do when
you break a nail?

13:33.079 --> 13:34.681
 You wanted to see me?

13:34.714 --> 13:38.084
   Yes. Mr. Belding
   showed me the note
   from your doctor.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.452
He did?

13:40.754 --> 13:42.088
You poor baby!

13:43.757 --> 13:44.991
  Poor baby?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.126
Here, sit down.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.629
  Can I do anything for you?

13:51.598 --> 13:55.335
  Well,
  I was feeling kind of weak
  during that test yesterday.

13:55.368 --> 14:00.073
  Maybe if you gave me an A, it
  might make my life
  a little more sunny.

14:00.106 --> 14:05.512
   Of course.
   I hope you don't mind me
   asking but

14:05.545 --> 14:10.617
 what is it exactly that you're
 suffering from?

14:10.650 --> 14:16.056
  Well, it's a very rare, uh...
  Deskarosis.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.458
  Deskarosis?

14:18.491 --> 14:24.064
 Yes, well it only
 affects one out of
 every 10... 12 billion people.

14:24.064 --> 14:28.301
   What a coincidence!
   My grandfather
   had that.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.469
He did?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.971
   You're not dying!

14:32.072 --> 14:33.073
   I'm not?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.207
There's a cure!

14:35.442 --> 14:36.609
Come over here!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.379
 Put your arms over your head.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.148
 Hop on one foot. Now,
 cluck like a chicken.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.416
 ( clucking )

14:45.085 --> 14:47.220
 What kind of treatment is this
 anyway?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.622
   I call it a dose of your own
   medicine.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.727
Would it help if I told you
I was feeling better?

14:53.760 --> 14:58.098
 Zack,
 life and death are nothing
 to fool around with.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.468
 Do you realize the pain you've
 caused everybody?
 Mr. Belding...

15:01.501 --> 15:03.336
   Yeah, that part was fun.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.205
No, it wasn't.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.241
   And it wasn't
   nice what you did
   to Stevie either.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.276
Stevie?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.045
 What does she care about me?

15:12.045 --> 15:14.447
 I'm just a guy
 she's going to sing
 to for three minutes.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.050
Not anymore she's not.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.451
  And let me tell
  you another thing.

15:18.485 --> 15:22.255
 Stevie cared
 a lot when she thought
 you were sick. A lot.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.227
 Now, go directly to
 Mr. Belding's office.
 He's waiting for you.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.134
 ( door bell ringing )

15:38.138 --> 15:39.406
  Hi.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.675
  I'm sorry, these track houses
  all look alike.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.277
If you're
looking for Miss Bliss
she's upstairs.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.079
   Do you want to
   come in and wait?

15:46.079 --> 15:49.082
  Yeah, sure. Thanks.

15:49.082 --> 15:53.520
  I'm Colleen.
  My friends call me Colleen.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.621
 Hi, I'm Zack.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.289
- Zack?
- Yeah.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.490
 As in Zachary Morris?

15:58.958 --> 16:02.629
 Wait a minute. How did you
 know that? Look,
 is Miss Bliss really here?

16:02.662 --> 16:05.365
   I saw this movie
   once when this lady
   escaped from an asylum...

16:05.398 --> 16:07.600
Calm down.
I'm Miss Bliss's niece.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.107
 I'm glad to see
 you're going to live.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.044
 Boy, nothing's
 a secret around here.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.513
  Did you really
  make a bet that you
  could kiss Stevie?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.649
 Yeah.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.250
   I guess you think
   she's pretty hot.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.486
 Nah.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.520
 Nah?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.156
Okay, she's not a dog.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.525
 Wait a minute. You went
 through all this trouble
 just to kiss someone

16:32.559 --> 16:34.394
   who's not a dog?

16:34.427 --> 16:35.462
 It was a bet!

16:37.630 --> 16:42.135
Look, I just
dropped by to apologize
to Miss Bliss and, uh,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.237
  I hope she can
  reach Stevie to say
  I'm sorry.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.305
  I'll give her the message.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.374
Anything else?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.142
 Yeah.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.544
  Ask her to tell
  Stevie that I love
  her music,

16:51.578 --> 16:53.346
   and I think she's
   a fool for giving it up.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.647
   What do you mean?

16:54.681 --> 16:55.715
   She had it made.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.352
 The easy life. Money. Limos.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.255
   Spending half her
   life in airports,
   living out of a suitcase.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.490
 Fame.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.025
  No privacy.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.226
  Are you a friend of
  hers or something?

17:07.594 --> 17:08.928
  Maybe I know how she feels.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.565
   Look, I gotta go.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.171
   You staying
   with Miss Bliss for
   a while?

17:18.204 --> 17:21.273
   No, I just decided I'm going
   to college.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.412
  Hey, Zack.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.149
 Don't you think Stevie is even
 a little hot?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.623
  Stevie who?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.169
  Ah,
  well, it's quite a turnout.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.204
 Did you see all
 those reporters
  in the hall?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.073
  What about
  the scalpers in the street!

17:53.106 --> 17:56.409
   One of them
   offered me $200 for my
   teacher ID card.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.311
 He didn't! What did you say?

17:58.345 --> 18:01.014
   I said, "Here,
   and I don't take checks!"

18:01.014 --> 18:06.453
 Oh, Zack, my gym bag's just
 right under my chair so just
 pick it up when you leave.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.556
 Too bad, Zack. I hope they
 have a washer and
 dryer in detention.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.394
 Well, I guess you won, Nikki.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.496
Oh, I love those words.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.031
   "You won, Nikki."

18:18.031 --> 18:20.066
Would you two be quiet!

18:20.100 --> 18:24.371
 This is the most
 exhilarating and
 depressing moment of my life!

18:24.404 --> 18:29.342
 Stevie is
 performing for the last time.

18:29.376 --> 18:33.313
 PA: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
 <i>our very</i>
 <i>own Stevie!</i>

18:39.552 --> 18:44.057
<i>I'd like to dedicate this song</i>
<i>to all my friends at JFK.</i>

18:44.057 --> 18:46.259
 ( music and singing )

20:38.605 --> 20:40.540
That was great, Stevie!

20:40.573 --> 20:42.275
  My friends call me Colleen.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.122
 That's her! I kissed Stevie!

20:56.156 --> 20:58.658
   Nikki, I won the bet!
   I kissed Stevie!

20:58.692 --> 21:01.227
   Zack, a bet's a bet.
   So you lost
   fair and square.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.328
   Oh,
   and, uh, don't forget to use
   softener.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.131
  No, no, really. Last night at
  Miss Bliss's house.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.567
   Come on, Lisa, let's go.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.102
 No, Nikki, it's true!

21:09.135 --> 21:11.104
 It's true,
 Nikki, I kissed her!

21:11.137 --> 21:13.473
   I kissed her,
   I'm serious I kissed her.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.575
   Look, I'll even ask her,
   I kissed her!

21:21.448 --> 21:23.717
  ( instrumental music plays )
