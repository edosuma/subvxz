00:01.433 --> 00:03.472
<i>Previously on Pretty Little Liars</i>

00:03.488 --> 00:06.992
We have new evidence in the DiLaurentis case, and
we need you to come in for a blood sample.

00:07.009 --> 00:09.277
My blood is not on your evidence.
Then why do you look so scared?

00:09.312 --> 00:11.313
I spoke to your father this morning.
You're seeing him?

00:11.347 --> 00:14.015
We made lunch plans. I guess I
have you to thank for that.

00:15.151 --> 00:17.085
Jason.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.220
Move <i>over!</i>
<i>Why?</i>

00:18.254 --> 00:19.955
Because this never happened.

00:19.989 --> 00:21.857
We found your vehicle
near the scene of an accident.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.058
We've been here
all night, detective.

00:23.092 --> 00:24.226
I picked her up
after work today.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.261
Is this yours? There's
still something in it.

00:26.295 --> 00:28.230
<i>I told the doctor</i>
<i>how little I had to drink,</i>

00:28.264 --> 00:29.865
<i>and he wanted to do</i>
<i>a tox screen...</i>

00:29.899 --> 00:32.334
there were traces
of milizopam in my system.

00:32.368 --> 00:35.303
A code? It's this stupid thing she
made back when we were friends.

00:35.338 --> 00:37.305
"Maya's away, sleeping sweet...

00:37.340 --> 00:39.908
Until Garrett's all rosy,
count on me."

00:39.942 --> 00:42.944
"Massugar"?

00:42.979 --> 00:45.947
I don't suppose crazy slipped
you the password as well.

00:49.986 --> 00:54.022
Mona's trying to help us. Why
else would she give us this?

00:54.056 --> 00:57.159
Emily's
still on the phone.

00:57.193 --> 01:00.362
She seemed to take
it okay, didn't she?

01:00.396 --> 01:03.198
What, like we should be used
to hearing from ghosts by now?

01:03.232 --> 01:06.034
Spencer, why can't you admit
that she trying to help us?

01:06.068 --> 01:09.037
Hanna, did you ever stop to think
why Mona would want to help us?

01:09.071 --> 01:10.305
Because she's afraid
of something...

01:10.339 --> 01:12.073
just like we were
afraid of <i>her.</i>

01:12.108 --> 01:14.176
I don't know.
Yeah, you <i>don</i> know...

01:14.210 --> 01:16.077
but the cops are still
after my blood.

01:16.112 --> 01:18.880
I told you, my mom will handle that.

01:18.915 --> 01:20.949
I <i>ha</i> needles.
Okay, look...

01:20.983 --> 01:25.086
whether this if fake or not, we've got
to figure out what's on that site.

01:26.355 --> 01:29.291
It was Nate.
What did he want?

01:29.325 --> 01:32.060
I promised to hike up with him
to the old boat house.

01:32.094 --> 01:34.162
Told him it was Maya's
favorite spot in Rosewood.

01:34.197 --> 01:39.868
You're not... Gonna, like,
tell him about this, are you?

01:39.902 --> 01:44.105
If I did that, I'd have to
tell him how we know about it.

01:44.140 --> 01:48.043
Em, what do you...
Want us to do about this?

01:51.280 --> 01:55.217
Do you mind if we try and
break into Maya's site?

01:55.251 --> 01:56.918
We have to.

01:56.953 --> 01:59.020
Okay. Um, well,

01:59.055 --> 02:01.223
- how do we get past the password?
- It's just a password...

02:01.257 --> 02:03.892
there are ways of cracking it.

02:16.973 --> 02:19.207
Thought I had an idea
of what it was.

02:19.242 --> 02:22.110
Guess I don't know her
as well as I thought I did.

02:25.181 --> 02:28.016
<i># Got a secret,</i>
<i>can you keep it #</i>

02:28.050 --> 02:30.318
<i># swear this one you'll save</i>

02:30.353 --> 02:33.054
<i># better lock it</i>
<i>in your pocket #</i>

02:33.089 --> 02:35.323
<i># taking this one</i>
<i>to the grave #</i>

02:35.358 --> 02:40.328
<i># if I show you then I'll know</i>
<i>you won't tell what I said #</i>

02:40.363 --> 02:45.300
<i># 'cause two can keep a secret</i>

02:49.972 --> 02:51.172
It's okay.

02:54.277 --> 02:57.145
Will you be home for dinner?
Yeah.

02:57.179 --> 02:59.281
Well, Mike's got a game,
we'll be back by six.

02:59.315 --> 03:01.249
If you could start the salad...

03:01.284 --> 03:03.852
I can do that.

03:03.886 --> 03:05.854
Good.

03:08.190 --> 03:10.959
Meredith got the job.

03:13.229 --> 03:16.131
The job at Rosewood high.
Yes.

03:16.165 --> 03:19.167
Are you gonna be
okay with that?

03:19.201 --> 03:23.972
Well, who gets to tell mom?

03:24.006 --> 03:27.175
I will tell your mother.

03:29.278 --> 03:31.012
I gotta go.

03:31.047 --> 03:33.181
Home by six?

03:33.215 --> 03:36.084
I'll start the salad.

03:36.118 --> 03:39.187
I taught her how to make
these little origami boats.

03:39.221 --> 03:43.291
We'd come out here at night
with paper and birthday candles,

03:43.326 --> 03:45.927
make them by the dozens...

03:45.961 --> 03:49.230
Then light the candles
and watch them float away.

03:49.265 --> 03:54.069
We used
to do the same thing.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.071
With... Paper balloons.

03:56.105 --> 03:59.908
Air, water, fire...

03:59.942 --> 04:03.244
Maya liked all the elements.

04:03.279 --> 04:08.183
You see her all the time, don't you?
Almost.

04:08.217 --> 04:11.886
In this place
it's really strong.

04:13.055 --> 04:16.024
Your friend Jenna stood me up.

04:21.063 --> 04:22.130
I'm sorry.

04:22.164 --> 04:25.033
Gave her a day
to call and explain,

04:25.067 --> 04:28.002
then I called her.
What did she say?

04:28.037 --> 04:31.172
She said she was sorry,
but a situation came up.

04:31.207 --> 04:34.042
Sounded like she thought
she was through with someone,

04:34.076 --> 04:35.977
but she wasn't.

04:36.011 --> 04:37.979
That happens.

04:40.983 --> 04:45.019
Weren't you scared
to come out here at night?

04:45.054 --> 04:48.056
I wasn't alone...
I was with Maya.

04:51.894 --> 04:55.930
I never understood
how somebody could do that...

04:55.965 --> 04:58.333
kill somebody.

04:58.367 --> 05:03.037
Then I saw garret
in the hospital...

05:03.072 --> 05:05.874
And I realized...

05:05.908 --> 05:10.044
Yeah... I could kill that guy...

05:10.079 --> 05:13.214
kill him with my bare hands.

05:13.249 --> 05:17.919
It wouldn't change anything. He'd be <i>dead.
It's a pretty big change.</i>

05:17.953 --> 05:20.822
Don't talk like that,
not here. Okay?

05:23.993 --> 05:26.861
I didn't mean to scare you.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.865
You didn't.
Good.

05:30.900 --> 05:34.869
I wouldn't want you
to be afraid of me.

05:40.276 --> 05:43.178
Okay, marine,
drop and give me twenty!

05:45.147 --> 05:47.949
Hello.
Hello.

05:47.983 --> 05:51.152
Aria, come in
and meet my... Mother.

05:51.187 --> 05:54.789
Hi.

05:54.824 --> 05:58.860
It's such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Fitz.
"Fitzgerald."

05:58.894 --> 06:01.162
Ezra likes to truncate
the name for some reason,

06:01.197 --> 06:03.798
but call me Diane.
Diane.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.100
I'm Aria.
Yes, you <i>are.</i>

06:06.135 --> 06:09.938
I'm so glad to finally meet the
mysterious girl with the lyrical name.

06:09.972 --> 06:13.741
Mysterious?
Well, elusive.

06:13.776 --> 06:16.044
Ezra's kept you
to himself all this time,

06:16.078 --> 06:17.946
I didn't want to
pass up this opportunity.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.948
There's a benefit
at the osgood museum,

06:19.982 --> 06:21.950
and my mother is
honorary trail boss.

06:21.984 --> 06:24.085
Oh, that's great.
Yes, it is.

06:24.119 --> 06:26.821
There's a reception
tomorrow night at the museum.

06:26.856 --> 06:28.122
I'd love it if
you both could come.

06:28.157 --> 06:31.125
That's kind of short notice, mom.
Indulge me.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.127
I <i>love</i> the osgood.

06:33.162 --> 06:36.164
The women have you outnumbered.

06:36.198 --> 06:38.066
Okay.
Perfect.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.202
I'll leave an invitation at the desk.
So glad I caught you.

06:41.237 --> 06:44.138
Oh, do you have to go?
We can have some coffee.

06:44.173 --> 06:47.141
Actually, we've got that thing.
Do you remember?

06:47.176 --> 06:51.112
Right. I completely
forgot about that.

06:51.146 --> 06:54.182
I don't want to disturb your Sunday.
We'll talk tomorrow night.

06:54.216 --> 06:57.051
Well, it's nice to meet you.
You too.

06:57.086 --> 07:00.021
I will s <i>you tomorrow night.</i>

07:00.055 --> 07:01.823
Yeah. Bye.

07:05.961 --> 07:07.962
"Fitzgerald," huh?

07:07.997 --> 07:10.932
If you want to be a writer, you don't want
an albatross like that around your neck.

07:10.966 --> 07:14.769
Right. And what if
your last name was Hemingway?

07:14.803 --> 07:17.105
Then I would be ezra hem.

07:17.139 --> 07:20.975
Sounds like
you're clearing your throat.

07:21.010 --> 07:24.112
You know, you don't have to go to this
thing tomorrow night if you don't want to.

07:24.146 --> 07:28.016
Are you kidding? I do. I mean,
the osgood and your mom?

07:28.050 --> 07:31.853
Did you notice how she never sat down?
I noticed her diamonds.

07:31.887 --> 07:35.056
Well, in the divorce she
got custody the jewelry.

07:35.090 --> 07:37.025
What does she know about us?

07:37.059 --> 07:40.995
Well... She knows
that I love you.

07:41.030 --> 07:44.032
That's a good start.
What else?

07:44.066 --> 07:49.270
I told her that we didn't start seeing each
other until after I left Rosewood high.

07:49.305 --> 07:52.840
You lied to your mother.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.242
Wasn't the first time.

08:00.849 --> 08:04.052
I thought you said you
can crack it. I can, okay?

08:04.086 --> 08:05.219
I just have not done it yet.

08:05.254 --> 08:07.188
None of the regular
work-arounds are working.

08:07.222 --> 08:10.758
So when do you give up? That is
completely the wrong attitude.

08:10.793 --> 08:13.161
We have to know what's on this!
Okay, but it's not a piÃ±ata.

08:13.195 --> 08:16.898
I can't just whack
at it with a stick!

08:27.176 --> 08:30.945
Okay, I think that I need help.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.246
What kind of help?

08:35.217 --> 08:36.784
Oh.

08:36.818 --> 08:39.187
I-I heard that Caleb
was back from California.

08:39.221 --> 08:43.224
I haven't seen him,
but... Yeah, I know he's back.

08:43.258 --> 08:45.827
He wouldn't even have to
know what this was for.

08:45.861 --> 08:49.964
I could just ask him for some tips on
how to get around a tough password.

08:49.999 --> 08:52.867
Yeah. You know what,
go ahead.

08:52.901 --> 08:56.838
At least one of us might be able
to be in the same room as him.

08:56.872 --> 08:59.107
Okay. I'll talk to him
tomorrow at school.

09:10.285 --> 09:13.221
Do you know where he is?

09:13.255 --> 09:14.889
Hey, Toby.
Hanna.

09:16.992 --> 09:20.028
Where... Who is?
Jason.

09:20.062 --> 09:23.131
Um, can you...
Wait upstairs?

09:23.165 --> 09:26.100
We'll be finished in a
couple minutes. Yeah.

09:31.206 --> 09:34.075
What do you mean,
"where is he?"

09:34.109 --> 09:36.244
I mean, I was just at his
house and he's gone.

09:36.278 --> 09:39.013
The house is locked,
his car isn't in the garage.

09:39.048 --> 09:40.882
So maybe he's just out.

09:40.916 --> 09:43.051
He's not driving around
with a busted-up front end.

09:43.085 --> 09:45.887
That car is evidence.
He's not out, he's <i>gone.</i>

09:45.921 --> 09:48.189
Across the state line,
paying cash to fix his car.

09:48.223 --> 09:51.025
You covered for him,
I covered for you,

09:51.060 --> 09:52.827
and you left us both
lying to the cops.

09:52.861 --> 09:54.028
I was just trying
to protect him.

09:54.063 --> 09:56.030
I think that you're the one
that needs protection.

09:56.065 --> 09:59.000
He's my brother, Toby. And the people
you really need protecting from

09:59.034 --> 10:00.868
are the ones you're related to.

10:00.903 --> 10:02.270
Before you talk to him,
you're gonna listen to <i>me.</i>

10:02.304 --> 10:04.305
Toby, please... I'm not gonna
ask you to explain anything,

10:04.339 --> 10:07.041
because you won't... you just
say that I have to trust you.

10:07.076 --> 10:09.210
Mona's locked up,
Garrett is locked up...

10:09.244 --> 10:12.180
but you still jump
every time your phone rings.

10:12.214 --> 10:14.982
It's...
I know, it's "complicated."

10:15.017 --> 10:17.985
So I'll make easy on you...
I'll find out for myself.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.359
Toby, please...

10:38.107 --> 10:41.109
Hey.
I rang the doorbell.

10:41.143 --> 10:43.211
My folks are in Scranton.

10:43.245 --> 10:45.213
Haven't seen you at school.

10:45.247 --> 10:47.248
I missed a few days.

10:47.282 --> 10:49.183
Are you okay?

10:49.218 --> 10:52.253
I felt pretty bad for a while,

10:52.287 --> 10:54.355
but I'm better now.

10:54.389 --> 10:58.159
Okay, we have to talk about this.
No. We don't.

10:58.193 --> 11:00.928
You got sick because
you drank from my flask.

11:00.963 --> 11:03.164
I have to explain who that
happened, or at least try explain.

11:03.198 --> 11:05.800
We can forget about
the whole thing. Honestly, em.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.869
You deserve to know the truth.

11:07.903 --> 11:09.904
Can we go someplace and talk?

11:09.938 --> 11:11.873
I can't today.

11:11.907 --> 11:13.975
Tomorrow?
After school?

11:14.009 --> 11:16.110
Please.

11:17.246 --> 11:21.082
Okay.

11:22.117 --> 11:23.317
Okay.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.996
So what couldn't you
tell me over the phone?

11:35.030 --> 11:38.833
Frankly, I shouldn't be telling you anything
at all, you're not immediate family.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.269
But I know how invested
you are in Mona.

11:41.303 --> 11:43.838
Did something happen to her?
Not yet.

11:43.872 --> 11:46.941
But they're gonna move her to
a different facility. Where?

11:46.975 --> 11:50.011
Near saratoga. In New York.
No, they can't!

11:50.045 --> 11:53.080
Her attending physicians think she needs
a more intense treatment program.

11:53.115 --> 11:56.918
Frankly, I think they're worried about
liability more than Mona's health.

11:56.952 --> 11:59.954
They want her under high security.
Why?

11:59.988 --> 12:03.090
For one, Mona's outburst
in the day room,

12:03.125 --> 12:05.860
and they realize she hasn't
been taking all her meds.

12:05.894 --> 12:07.995
They think she's been smuggling
them out with a visitor.

12:08.030 --> 12:10.231
What visitor?
Not you.

12:10.265 --> 12:12.133
But Mona's surprisingly
popular.

12:12.167 --> 12:15.903
They can't send her away.
What about her parents?

12:15.938 --> 12:19.807
They're still in denial. They'll go along
with whatever the board recommends.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.876
Well, talk the board out of it!
What?

12:21.910 --> 12:23.277
Talk them out of moving her.

12:23.312 --> 12:25.046
Tell them in your
expert opinion you think

12:25.080 --> 12:26.981
she's gonna get much better
right here in Rosewood.

12:27.015 --> 12:28.950
My expert opinion
might not mean much.

12:28.984 --> 12:31.953
These are the men who wrote the textbooks.
I don't care about the books.

12:33.322 --> 12:36.958
I can't promise anything,
but I'll talk to them.

12:38.994 --> 12:40.194
You can do it.

12:40.229 --> 12:42.196
Your confidence in me
is bracing.

12:42.231 --> 12:44.999
Essentially misplaced,
but bracing.

12:54.243 --> 12:55.943
Excuse me.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.053
Wow!

13:28.641 --> 13:29.575
This is very impressive.

13:32.122 --> 13:33.804
My mom doesn't use it much
since the accident,

13:33.857 --> 13:35.556
so she let me take it.

13:36.408 --> 13:38.003
You drove it back
from California?

13:38.321 --> 13:40.780
I have a lot of thinking to do.
Driving helps.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.185
Yeah. I get it.

13:45.246 --> 13:49.689
Um, listen, I have sort of an
abstract computer question.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.359
I was wondering if you
could help me out with it.

13:51.383 --> 13:53.118
What's the question?

13:53.152 --> 13:55.053
I was wondering what's
the best way to get around

13:55.087 --> 13:57.956
really tough password
protection.

13:57.990 --> 14:00.191
That's about as abstract
as a brick wall.

14:00.226 --> 14:03.862
Yeah, okay. Maybe we are
talking about a real password.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.964
"Maybe"?

14:05.998 --> 14:08.867
There's a particular site
that I cannot get onto.

14:08.901 --> 14:11.870
Whose site is it?

14:13.205 --> 14:15.840
What should I wear?

14:15.875 --> 14:18.109
I have to look
insanely sophisticated for this.

14:18.144 --> 14:21.246
How about a...
Hello kitty t-shirt?

14:21.280 --> 14:24.082
Help me, please.
This is Ezra's mom.

14:24.116 --> 14:25.917
So what's she like?

14:25.951 --> 14:28.052
Diamonds and chanel
on a Sunday morning.

14:28.087 --> 14:31.289
I think you're in
Spencer territory.

14:31.323 --> 14:33.858
That's a good idea.

14:33.893 --> 14:36.895
So, ezra's family
has some money.

14:36.929 --> 14:39.130
Yeah, his mom does.

14:39.165 --> 14:40.999
What?

14:41.033 --> 14:43.168
You just said he's been
scrambling for work.

14:43.202 --> 14:45.236
I have been with the boy
who gets a fat allowance.

14:45.271 --> 14:47.138
It's like having the parent
on the date with you.

14:47.173 --> 14:50.108
Yeah, but if he really needed help,
don't you think he'd ask her?

14:53.345 --> 14:57.015
If it is real, I have no
idea how Mona got it.

14:57.049 --> 15:02.053
But if it's fake, it's an insanely
cruel thing to do to Emily.

15:02.087 --> 15:04.889
I know that we've asked you to
doomething like this before,

15:04.924 --> 15:07.158
so I get it if you don't...
no, I'll do it.

15:07.193 --> 15:10.862
Look, whatever happened,
Hanna's important to me.

15:10.896 --> 15:13.898
So if I have a chance
to crush the Mona monster,

15:13.933 --> 15:15.900
I'm in.

15:15.935 --> 15:18.236
After school?
Yeah, after school.

15:31.850 --> 15:33.151
<i>"Mona's almost gone"?</i>

15:33.185 --> 15:35.853
Gone where?

15:35.888 --> 15:38.990
The doctors at radley want to
send her to another hospital...

15:39.024 --> 15:41.259
one with thicker bars.
How do you know that?

15:41.293 --> 15:43.261
Wren told me.
He did?

15:43.295 --> 15:46.130
What does he have to do
with any of this?

15:46.165 --> 15:47.966
He thought I should know,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.003
and he said that Mona's been
passing her meds to a visitor.

15:52.037 --> 15:55.073
Lucas? You're saying that the
pills that Aria found in his bag

15:55.107 --> 15:56.908
might be for Mona?
I don't know.

15:56.942 --> 15:59.978
Wren didn't tell me, so I didn't ask.
And "Hanna's next."

16:00.012 --> 16:03.881
I don't want to give anyone any of my blood.
I need all I got.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.917
My mom is handling it.
Wait a second.

16:05.951 --> 16:08.886
If they send Mona away, we're not gonna
find out why she gave us Maya's site.

16:08.921 --> 16:12.156
If it really <i>is</i> Maya's site.

16:12.191 --> 16:16.060
You're sure your mom can stop this
court order on Hanna's blood?

16:16.095 --> 16:19.030
My mom picks her teeth
with court orders.

16:19.064 --> 16:20.832
What did you want to borrow?

16:20.866 --> 16:23.201
I want something classy
but not frumpy.

16:24.270 --> 16:25.903
Not that you have frumpy.

16:30.276 --> 16:32.076
Mom?

16:35.848 --> 16:38.149
Spencer, she's gonna know
you went through there.

16:38.183 --> 16:40.852
I can get in and out
without leaving a trace.

16:42.221 --> 16:44.856
Ooh, jackpot.

16:44.890 --> 16:46.891
Garrett's file?

16:46.925 --> 16:48.893
Yeah. The works.

16:48.927 --> 16:51.229
Get out your phone.
We're taking pictures.

17:00.973 --> 17:02.140
Paige!

17:11.750 --> 17:13.984
That drug that made you sick...

17:14.019 --> 17:17.888
it didn't come from anybody at the party.
It was in my flask.

17:17.923 --> 17:21.726
You know that, don't you?
I guess I figured that out.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.728
When I gave it to you,
I didn't know it.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.730
I swear, I would never
do that to you.

17:25.763 --> 17:28.098
But somebody did that <i>you.</i>

17:28.133 --> 17:29.901
Yeah, somebody did it to me.

17:29.935 --> 17:31.135
Who?

17:31.170 --> 17:33.104
I don't know.

17:33.138 --> 17:36.774
Do you know when it happened?

17:36.809 --> 17:40.878
It was the night that
somebody dug up Ali's grave.

17:40.913 --> 17:44.749
I drank from the flask and I..

17:44.783 --> 17:46.017
Lost time.

17:46.051 --> 17:49.954
I was at Spencer's,
and then I wasn't at Spencer's,

17:49.988 --> 17:53.991
and I'm trying to find out
what happened to me.

17:57.996 --> 17:59.864
You were with me.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.737
Part of that night...
You were with me.

18:11.956 --> 18:14.191
Maya wasn't just strangled.

18:15.119 --> 18:17.446
by a pipe or a metal bar.

18:17.992 --> 18:21.595
Or a policeman's nightstick.

18:21.629 --> 18:24.898
"Lividity indicates the victim
was killed at the scene."

18:24.933 --> 18:28.902
Lividity? It's the way blood settles
in the body when the heart stops.

18:28.937 --> 18:31.080
It means that Maya was killed
right there in Emily's backyard.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.067
Look at this.

18:34.102 --> 18:36.370
Maya was killed the same night that
Garrett was arrested at my house.

18:36.404 --> 18:38.338
Between 10 P.M. and 2 A.M.

18:38.373 --> 18:41.942
Which means that he had plenty of time
to kill Maya and meet with Melissa.

18:41.976 --> 18:44.044
Poor Maya.

18:44.078 --> 18:46.013
She was just out there
in the backyard the whole time?

18:46.047 --> 18:47.414
Well, the tenants
had moved out,

18:47.448 --> 18:49.383
and Emily hadn't moved back in.

18:49.417 --> 18:51.218
The house was empty.

18:53.421 --> 18:56.423
Says that there was no personal
property found at the scene.

18:56.457 --> 19:00.394
So if she had a bag,
somebody took it with them.

19:00.428 --> 19:03.130
What's this?
The prosecution witness list.

19:03.164 --> 19:07.234
Look at that.
Bart comstock?

19:07.268 --> 19:10.170
"Break him
and it falls apart."

19:10.204 --> 19:11.972
My mom is gonna
go after this guy.

19:12.006 --> 19:14.107
He must know something
or have seen something.

19:14.142 --> 19:16.276
Yeah, something bad
about Garrett.

19:16.311 --> 19:18.979
And she thinks that if she can
break him, she could win.

19:19.013 --> 19:21.949
The address is in Rosewood.
Do you want to go there?

19:21.983 --> 19:24.017
Caleb's gonna be here
any minute.

19:24.052 --> 19:26.954
I'll go on my way home.

19:26.988 --> 19:29.222
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

19:29.257 --> 19:32.326
I'm just gonna
see what's there.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.128
You're not gonna tell Caleb
about these, are you?

19:35.163 --> 19:37.965
No. It's strictly
"need to know."

19:37.999 --> 19:39.933
Okay, bye.

19:39.968 --> 19:44.171
It was about eleven o'clock, I think.
My folks were out.

19:44.205 --> 19:48.008
I heard something
on the front porch.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.177
You were sitting on my steps.

19:50.211 --> 19:55.182
You were drunk.
I thought you were drunk.

19:55.216 --> 19:58.018
Do you remember me
taking you into the house?

19:58.052 --> 20:01.021
I don't remember.

20:01.055 --> 20:03.957
I was holding you up.

20:03.992 --> 20:06.960
Then I wasn't holding you...

20:06.995 --> 20:09.062
you were holding <i>me.</i>

20:11.466 --> 20:13.467
You kissed me.

20:16.437 --> 20:18.438
Maybe you thought
I was someone else,

20:18.473 --> 20:21.341
I think I knew that,
but I didn't stop you.

20:21.376 --> 20:24.478
I didn't <i>wa</i> to stop you.
It was... Like a dream.

20:27.148 --> 20:30.417
And then what happened?

20:32.120 --> 20:33.987
The dream ended.

20:36.224 --> 20:40.127
I went into the kitchen
to get you a glass of water,

20:40.161 --> 20:44.097
and when I came back
you were gone.

20:44.132 --> 20:47.434
I tried to call your phone,
but you didn't answer.

20:47.468 --> 20:51.204
Somebody called me at eleven.

20:51.239 --> 20:55.242
Then at school, I could
tell you didn't remember.

20:55.276 --> 20:57.077
Or you didn't <i>want to remember.</i>

20:57.111 --> 21:00.147
No, I <i>didn't</i> remember.
I don't remember!

21:00.181 --> 21:02.249
Why wouldn't you have
told me this sooner?

21:02.283 --> 21:06.086
I convinced myself that what
I did was okay. It wasn't.

21:06.120 --> 21:11.358
You were there,
and I just got... Greedy.

21:11.392 --> 21:14.261
It was bad enough when
I thought you were drunk,

21:14.295 --> 21:20.934
but when I found out about the flask, I felt...
Worse than awful.

21:20.968 --> 21:24.071
Please, Emily, you have
to understand, I didn't...

21:43.324 --> 21:46.393
I'm afraid you're much more impressed
with my opinion than the board.

21:46.427 --> 21:49.996
I couldn't say anything
to change their minds.

21:50.031 --> 21:51.398
When do they send her away?

21:51.432 --> 21:54.101
It's just a matter
of paperwork now.

22:07.115 --> 22:11.251
Look, Hanna, we may have been
going about this the wrong way.

22:11.285 --> 22:14.121
I'm not the person to speak
to them on Mona's behalf.

22:14.155 --> 22:16.223
You are.
Me?

22:16.257 --> 22:19.926
Yeah. You've been visiting her for months.
You're her friend.

22:19.961 --> 22:22.095
You want me to talk to
a bunch of doctors?

22:22.130 --> 22:24.931
Not the whole board,
just her primary physicians.

22:24.966 --> 22:26.366
There's an advocacy
hearing tonight.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.235
Explain it to them
the way you explained it to me.

22:28.269 --> 22:31.204
No. I can't talk to them
the way I talk to you.

22:31.239 --> 22:34.307
Then you better be prepared
to say good-bye to Mona.

22:47.321 --> 22:49.322
Oh. We're not open.

22:49.357 --> 22:52.092
First show's at six-thirty.

22:52.126 --> 22:54.394
Oh. I was just coming by

22:54.428 --> 22:57.297
for a schedule for
the film festival.

22:57.331 --> 22:59.232
Sure. Yeah.

22:59.267 --> 23:03.036
Some... Great stuff
comin' up.

23:03.070 --> 23:06.006
Lot of that's not on DVD.
Thanks.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.276
It's funny, I've been coming
to this theater my whole life,

23:09.310 --> 23:13.079
and I never thought of it as
having an address or a number.

23:13.114 --> 23:15.048
You just say,
"I'm going to the movies,"

23:15.082 --> 23:17.350
and everybody
knew what you meant.

23:17.385 --> 23:21.254
Yeah. Like when you say
you're going to church.

23:21.289 --> 23:23.423
Yeah, I guess so.

23:27.028 --> 23:29.196
Anything else
I can help you with?

23:31.365 --> 23:36.336
I'm usually pretty good
figuring out passwords.

23:36.370 --> 23:39.906
That's because most people
don't want good passwords...

23:39.941 --> 23:42.342
they want password.

23:42.376 --> 23:45.345
Passwords keep you
from going in the front door.

23:45.379 --> 23:47.280
I like to look for
an open window,

23:47.315 --> 23:50.083
something that allows you
to get into the system

23:50.117 --> 23:51.318
and unlock things
from the other side.

23:51.352 --> 23:55.355
Like a burglar.
That's the idea.

23:55.389 --> 23:58.024
That's a nice machine.

23:58.059 --> 23:59.226
Your folks?

23:59.260 --> 24:01.995
My mom.

24:02.029 --> 24:05.265
Hmm. New car, new computer...

24:05.299 --> 24:08.068
She just <i>lent</i> me the car.

24:08.102 --> 24:11.171
Okay, she didn't <i>lend</i> you
that sweater.

24:11.205 --> 24:14.174
No, it's a rental.

24:14.208 --> 24:17.877
What? Do you just want me to admit
that my mom bought me new clothes?

24:17.912 --> 24:19.112
That <i>not</i> just clothing.

24:19.146 --> 24:21.948
That is $400 worth of sweater
you have there.

24:25.219 --> 24:27.220
So I should probably wash it
on "gentle" then, right?

24:27.255 --> 24:29.022
No! You should
dry clean it!

24:29.056 --> 24:31.291
If you wash this, you will end up
with a sweater for a shih tzu.

24:31.325 --> 24:35.095
I have never been
a dry cleaning kind of guy.

24:35.129 --> 24:38.064
That was then, and this is now.

24:41.202 --> 24:42.269
<i>Yeah,</i>

24:42.303 --> 24:44.070
I know who
you're talking about.

24:44.105 --> 24:46.106
I remember those two girls.

24:46.140 --> 24:50.277
That is a couple
you don't forget.

24:50.311 --> 24:53.179
How's your friend doing?

24:53.214 --> 24:55.115
It's hard.

24:55.149 --> 24:58.218
And the roughest part was that we
all had to talk to the police.

24:58.252 --> 25:01.254
Yeah. I know.
Listen, they talked to me.

25:01.289 --> 25:03.990
Why would they talk to you?

25:04.025 --> 25:06.293
Well, like I said,
I remembered her,

25:06.327 --> 25:08.995
so that's how I recognized her.

25:09.030 --> 25:10.830
Recognized her where?

25:10.865 --> 25:12.999
Well, it was late,
I was up on the marquee

25:13.034 --> 25:15.902
changing the bill,
and I saw her

25:15.936 --> 25:19.172
get in the cop car with
the guy who killed her.

25:19.206 --> 25:22.942
Maya got into a police car
with Garrett Reynolds?

25:22.977 --> 25:26.880
Yeah, right up the block.
The night he killed her.

25:26.914 --> 25:29.282
She probably thought
she was safe. I mean,

25:29.317 --> 25:34.020
how could she know
that the cop was crazy?

25:34.055 --> 25:36.189
Just can't trust anybody.

25:36.223 --> 25:39.059
Yeah, that's for sure.

25:42.603 --> 25:45.638
These are so deadly.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.381
Put the pretzel down and cross your fingers.

25:56.627 --> 25:57.894
We're in.

25:57.928 --> 25:59.862
You're kidding.

26:01.011 --> 26:03.799
<i>"But at my back I always hear</i>

26:03.834 --> 26:06.869
<i>time's winged chariot</i>
<i>hurrying near."</i>

26:06.904 --> 26:09.672
<i>Andy marvel...</i>
<i>what a marvel...</i>

26:09.706 --> 26:11.841
<i>talking to his coy mistress</i>

26:11.875 --> 26:14.477
<i>about how they shouldn't</i>
<i>waste any time.</i>

26:14.511 --> 26:16.646
<i>Like you're doing</i>
<i>listening to me.</i>

26:16.680 --> 26:19.649
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
that you got us in!

26:19.683 --> 26:24.520
<i>This is where I'm going to put
things to keep from losing them.</i>

26:24.554 --> 26:26.722
<i>I'm always losing things.</i>

26:30.460 --> 26:32.862
So this really is Maya's site.

26:34.765 --> 26:36.866
Yeah. It is.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.802
<i>If you're looking at me,</i>
<i>beware...</i>

26:39.836 --> 26:42.805
<i>this site is cursed.</i>

26:51.949 --> 26:54.450
It is completely real.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.786
Did you find anything?
Yeah, that guy Bart comstock,

26:56.820 --> 26:59.655
he saw Maya get into a police car
with Garrett the night he killed her.

26:59.690 --> 27:03.726
H-he told you that?

27:03.760 --> 27:05.561
That's why your mom
wants to squash him.

27:05.595 --> 27:09.598
I'm gonna try Emily again.
<i>Okay, just...</i>

27:09.633 --> 27:11.400
Please let me know
when you get ahold of her.

27:11.435 --> 27:13.669
Okay. Bye.

27:28.618 --> 27:32.822
Look, it's not too late to ditch this
and find a miniature golf course.

27:32.856 --> 27:36.492
Lyle and frances springer.

27:36.526 --> 27:38.661
Yeah. My grandparents.

27:38.695 --> 27:42.498
As in springer
preservation fund?

27:42.532 --> 27:44.800
Springer endowment
for the arts?

27:44.835 --> 27:46.535
Guilty.

27:50.474 --> 27:51.774
Hi.

28:05.756 --> 28:09.792
Ezra. All of this stuff
belongs to your family?

28:09.826 --> 28:11.727
Yeah.

28:11.762 --> 28:15.564
Your family doesn't have money,
your family h <i>money.</i>

28:17.901 --> 28:19.735
Look...

28:19.770 --> 28:22.538
I should have figured out
a way to tell you about this,

28:22.572 --> 28:26.642
but it's kind of hard to
work into a conversation.

28:26.676 --> 28:29.478
You were cutting off
a lot more than a name

28:29.513 --> 28:32.581
when you went from
Fitzgerald to Fitz.

28:32.616 --> 28:35.451
All this stuff, it used to be
in my grandparents' house,

28:35.485 --> 28:37.520
and the only people that
ever saw it were my faly

28:37.554 --> 28:40.389
and people they paid
to clean up after them.

28:40.424 --> 28:43.392
And they were fine with that.
But I'm not.

28:43.427 --> 28:46.829
I just always thought that you
ever talked about your family

28:46.863 --> 28:49.832
because you didn't want them
knowing about me.

28:49.866 --> 28:52.701
I wasn't keep you
away from my family.

28:52.736 --> 28:55.704
I was keeping my family
away from <i>you.</i>

28:57.841 --> 29:00.643
Are you angry?

29:00.677 --> 29:03.512
No...

29:03.547 --> 29:05.815
No, I don't think so.

29:05.849 --> 29:10.753
But I think that you owe me something
for all those ramen noodles.

29:10.787 --> 29:13.656
I think we can negotiate that.
Okay.

29:31.775 --> 29:34.543
It's okay.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.548
Sorry. I didn't think
there was anyone here.

29:39.583 --> 29:42.852
I wanted to see
what it was like at night.

29:49.759 --> 29:54.530
Yesterday was your first time
back here since she died...

29:54.564 --> 29:57.433
Wasn't it?

29:57.467 --> 29:59.401
Yeah.

29:59.436 --> 30:02.571
I upset you...
Making you come out here.

30:02.606 --> 30:05.541
No. It's not that.

30:05.575 --> 30:07.543
You sure?
Yeah.

30:07.577 --> 30:09.745
I'm... I'm glad
you made me come back.

30:09.779 --> 30:12.648
"Made me come back."
That doesn't sound so good.

30:12.682 --> 30:17.386
I wanted to. You just
helped me make up my mind.

30:17.420 --> 30:18.587
All right.

30:18.622 --> 30:22.424
That was yesterday.
How about tonight?

30:26.530 --> 30:28.464
Do you think it's possible

30:28.498 --> 30:32.601
to do something without
knowing you're doing it?

30:32.636 --> 30:36.572
I mean, without knowi <i>why</i>
<i>you're doing it?</i>

30:45.682 --> 30:46.916
No.

30:50.687 --> 30:52.721
I think we're always
who we are.

30:54.457 --> 30:58.727
Okay, but suppose
you were drunk.

30:58.762 --> 31:02.498
People drink to cover up
what they want.

31:02.532 --> 31:06.702
It's like when you do things
in a dream

31:06.736 --> 31:11.373
and it frightens you because you
didn't think that's who you are.

31:11.408 --> 31:14.810
But it's you.

31:14.844 --> 31:17.780
Even in a dream,
it's still you.

31:22.652 --> 31:25.654
You cold?
Yeah, a little.

31:33.797 --> 31:35.698
Thanks.

31:53.617 --> 31:55.751
You looked lonely over here.

31:55.785 --> 31:57.620
Oh, I'm fine.

31:59.623 --> 32:00.823
These a <i>amazing.</i>

32:00.857 --> 32:03.459
Ezra said that they belonged
to your mom and dad.

32:03.493 --> 32:04.693
That's right.

32:04.728 --> 32:07.763
He hasn't told you very much
about himself, has he?

32:07.797 --> 32:10.633
Well, we're still learning.
Yes.

32:10.667 --> 32:16.372
Well, you certainly know about the
dedicated teacher, the struggling writer.

32:16.406 --> 32:19.375
You fit right into that world...
you get to be the muse.

32:19.409 --> 32:22.444
Oh, no, I wouldn't
pretend to be that.

32:22.479 --> 32:25.714
Don't diminish yourself. You have
a very important role in this.

32:25.749 --> 32:30.853
I just... I don't think of myself
as playing <i>any</i> role with ezra.

32:30.887 --> 32:33.489
No, I don't suppose you do.

32:34.824 --> 32:38.494
What do your parents
think about ezra?

32:38.528 --> 32:42.531
Well, my mom likes him
a lot more than my dad.

32:42.565 --> 32:44.667
Fathers and daughters...
that can be tricky.

32:44.701 --> 32:48.704
Yeah. New man coming along to
take away daddy's little girl.

32:48.738 --> 32:51.540
Your parents are divorced,
aren't they? Yeah.

32:51.574 --> 32:53.876
Yeah, they are.
Recently?

32:53.910 --> 32:55.678
Guess you could say that.

32:55.712 --> 32:59.415
As recently as when
you started seeing ezra?

32:59.449 --> 33:03.385
Seeing him... Romantically,
I mean.

33:03.420 --> 33:07.690
You ask questions like
you already know the answers.

33:10.393 --> 33:14.797
It's really very easy to find out
what you need to know about people.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.701
Oh. All... all due respect,

33:18.735 --> 33:21.737
but my family's not really
any of your business.

33:21.771 --> 33:24.506
Oh, but it's such
an interesting family.

33:24.541 --> 33:26.375
Your brother's arrest record,

33:26.409 --> 33:28.544
your romance with
a former teacher,

33:28.578 --> 33:31.714
the way your mother moved out
over your father's infidelity.

33:31.748 --> 33:35.684
You can literally chart
all the cracks and strains.

33:38.655 --> 33:39.688
Excuse me.

33:39.723 --> 33:41.690
Aria.

33:43.626 --> 33:46.495
You act as if
I've hurt your feelings.

33:46.529 --> 33:48.764
It was unintentional.

33:51.601 --> 33:54.470
I just want to make sure
that I'm being clear.

33:55.839 --> 33:58.841
I may not agree with
the way ezra lives his life,

33:58.875 --> 34:03.445
but I'm not gonna stand by
and let you ruin him.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.713
I love him.

34:04.748 --> 34:06.782
Oh, yes.

34:06.816 --> 34:11.652
It's all romance and sacrifice
in your little Paris garret.

34:11.688 --> 34:15.690
Except you determine
what gets sacrificed, not him.

34:15.725 --> 34:19.795
You're the one that made it impossible for
him to stay at your little high school.

34:19.829 --> 34:23.399
You're the one who got him
tossed out of Hollis.

34:23.433 --> 34:26.435
I want to make sure
you understand your own motives.

34:27.737 --> 34:29.705
I-I don't have
any <i>motives.</i>

34:29.739 --> 34:31.774
<i>Everyone</i> has motives.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.775
Maybe in your world.

34:33.810 --> 34:37.612
It's not too late for us
to have a practical discussion.

34:37.647 --> 34:40.716
There can be real-world
compensations in your ending this.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.818
Compensations?

34:42.851 --> 34:46.588
I've got your attention at last.

34:46.623 --> 34:48.556
I thought I might.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.756
What did you say to her?
What did I say to whom?

35:16.791 --> 35:18.892
I can't find Aria.

35:18.926 --> 35:20.927
Ohoh. Is she gone?

35:20.962 --> 35:24.764
She was talking to you
the last time I saw her.

35:24.799 --> 35:27.767
Maybe it's past your bedtime?

35:27.802 --> 35:30.670
It's astounding that you
can do things like this

35:30.705 --> 35:33.607
and still not understand why I want
nothing to do with this family.

35:33.641 --> 35:36.042
I really don't know
what you think I've done.

35:36.077 --> 35:38.812
I had a lovely chat
with the girl.

35:40.648 --> 35:43.984
I don't know, maybe she just
felt out of place.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.720
You can endow
all the museums you want,

35:46.754 --> 35:49.689
but you're not fooling anybody.

35:49.724 --> 35:52.792
There's not a generous bone
in your body.

35:59.066 --> 36:04.004
I believe it would be very therapeutic
for Mona to stay at radley.

36:04.038 --> 36:07.574
She needs the continuity
of clinical environment

36:07.608 --> 36:10.644
so important to fully integrate
the socially challenged teen

36:10.678 --> 36:12.979
back into the peer community.

36:23.891 --> 36:27.694
Look, Mona did
some terrible things.

36:27.728 --> 36:31.831
She did some of them to me,
and I'm her best friend.

36:33.534 --> 36:34.901
I-I don't know how she could,

36:34.936 --> 36:38.972
but I think I understand
how angry she was.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.677
Mona and I are very,
very close, I mean,

36:43.711 --> 36:45.979
we're like the same person.

36:46.013 --> 36:48.915
We started out
at the same place.

36:50.618 --> 36:52.919
And we were so close
to becoming those girls

36:52.954 --> 36:55.622
who would sit at a table
and guard purses

36:55.656 --> 36:58.858
while the hot girls were
on the floor dancing.

36:58.893 --> 37:02.829
But Mona made sure
we didn't disappear...

37:02.863 --> 37:05.565
And I owe her for that.

37:06.734 --> 37:09.602
Look, I see her in that robe
and those slippers,

37:09.637 --> 37:12.872
and I realize that
could be me in there.

37:14.842 --> 37:18.578
And if it was me,
Mona would be sitting here

37:18.612 --> 37:21.781
asking all of you
to not send me away.

37:21.816 --> 37:23.750
So please don't.

37:25.820 --> 37:28.621
Don't send her to saratoga.

37:28.656 --> 37:31.624
She doesn <i>know</i> anyone
in saratoga.

37:31.659 --> 37:34.561
There will be no one there
to hold her hand.

37:36.664 --> 37:39.799
And no one will care a brown
rat's ass for her in saratoga.

37:42.003 --> 37:44.571
So please.

38:01.555 --> 38:03.757
I'm sorry.

38:05.626 --> 38:07.527
It wasn't your fault.

38:07.561 --> 38:10.563
I shouldn't have let it happen.

38:10.598 --> 38:12.532
It was wrong.

38:12.566 --> 38:14.934
If I ever find out who put
that stuff in your flask,

38:14.969 --> 38:16.936
I swear I'll kill them.

38:16.971 --> 38:18.738
Don't say that.
I mean it.

38:18.773 --> 38:22.842
I don't want you to say it,
I don't want you to mean it.

38:22.877 --> 38:25.545
I want you to listen.

38:26.981 --> 38:30.717
I haven't been with anyone
since Maya.

38:30.751 --> 38:33.753
I haven't even
thought about it.

38:33.788 --> 38:36.523
Or at least I didn't <i>think</i>
<i>I was thinking about it.</i>

38:39.894 --> 38:43.530
I was drunk that night,
and I got lost.

38:44.799 --> 38:46.933
Only I didn't really get lost.

38:48.669 --> 38:50.603
I was looking for something.

38:51.772 --> 38:54.874
I was looking for somebody...

38:54.909 --> 38:56.876
And I came here.

38:59.947 --> 39:01.948
Don't look away.

39:27.942 --> 39:29.709
I heard you come in.

39:29.743 --> 39:32.846
Yeah, I got home
a little while ago.

39:35.716 --> 39:37.517
Are you okay?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.721
Aria?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.661
Did I ruin ezra's life?

39:50.731 --> 39:53.600
What are you talking about?

39:53.634 --> 39:55.802
I know that you think
he's wrecking mine,

39:55.836 --> 39:58.905
but am I just really
screwing things up for him?

40:10.918 --> 40:14.454
Am I responsible?

40:14.488 --> 40:18.858
Am I... am I just destroying
everything that I touch?

40:18.893 --> 40:22.695
No. You couldn't.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.698
You would never hurt anyone.

40:25.733 --> 40:29.702
And no one could ever be harmed
by having you in their life.

40:56.384 --> 40:59.419
I screwed up, didn't I?

40:59.453 --> 41:01.555
They're probably gonna
send her to Mars now.

41:01.589 --> 41:04.424
You did the opposite
of screwing up.

41:04.458 --> 41:06.493
Based on your testimony,
the board has decided

41:06.527 --> 41:08.361
to delay any decision
to transfer Mona.

41:08.396 --> 41:10.497
She gets to stay?
She gets to stay.

41:10.531 --> 41:12.566
Oh, my God!

41:15.436 --> 41:17.404
I thought you'd be pleased.

41:17.438 --> 41:21.374
I am.
Thank you.

41:21.409 --> 41:22.576
You're welcome.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.354
<i>You're making me laugh.</i>

41:34.388 --> 41:36.256
<i>I'm trying to eat.</i>

41:39.594 --> 41:42.495
We should not be watching this.
<i>Stop it.</i>

41:42.530 --> 41:46.499
There are hundreds of videos, and you don't
know what they are until you open them.

41:51.606 --> 41:53.573
Everything's jumbled up.

41:53.608 --> 41:56.476
Yeah, it's more of a junk
drawer than a journal.

41:56.510 --> 41:58.311
Yeah, but this is real.

41:58.346 --> 42:00.280
Mona gave us
the genuine article.

42:00.314 --> 42:01.481
How?
Why?

42:01.515 --> 42:02.582
To <i>help</i> us.

42:04.352 --> 42:06.086
How much of this did Caleb see?

42:06.120 --> 42:09.089
He didn't want to see any of it
once he realized what it was,

42:09.123 --> 42:11.157
but he got us in there.

42:12.460 --> 42:16.196
<i>I think Emily's got</i>
<i>a very old soul.</i>

42:16.230 --> 42:19.165
<i>I feel it when I kiss her.</i>

42:19.200 --> 42:22.402
<i>I can hear clocks all over
the world running backwards.</i>

42:22.436 --> 42:24.537
I'm so out of my comfort zone.

42:26.374 --> 42:27.374
Hanna, don't...

42:27.408 --> 42:28.541
just one more.

42:30.244 --> 42:33.213
<i>I'm such a coward.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

42:34.448 --> 42:37.284
<i>I have to face my fears.</i>

42:37.318 --> 42:39.552
<i>I can't hide forever.</i>

42:39.587 --> 42:41.588
<i>I can't keep being afraid.</i>

42:44.425 --> 42:46.459
Call her.
Her phone is off.

42:46.494 --> 42:48.395
Well, call her again. Now.

42:48.429 --> 42:51.564
We can't watch this
without her.

42:51.599 --> 42:53.533
At least it's on this time.

42:57.371 --> 43:00.373
<i># Let me float all day</i>

43:00.408 --> 43:03.209
<i># just be there till I know</i>

43:03.244 --> 43:06.513
<i># till I, I know that</i>

43:06.547 --> 43:09.082
<i># the riot's gone</i>

43:09.116 --> 43:12.185
<i># the riot's gone away</i>

43:25.433 --> 43:28.501
Just looking at you in
that hoodie makes me shiver.

43:28.536 --> 43:31.204
I guess summer's really over.

43:35.861 --> 43:40.966
