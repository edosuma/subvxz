00:06.047 --> 00:12.387
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:14.305 --> 00:16.808
ROYAL ACADEMY

00:22.063 --> 00:24.274
What's up?

00:24.357 --> 00:26.526
Are you okay?

00:28.278 --> 00:31.448
-When you fall, I flip you.
-Yeah, I'm sorry. It just… I'm…

00:31.531 --> 00:34.784
It's nothing personal, but could I just
maybe try it with Vicente?

00:35.410 --> 00:38.079
I feel like with him,
my flow is just a little better.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
Look at you, huh?
That's really interesting.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.875
You trying to direct now too?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.084
Listen, Mateo.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.212
If you can't handle criticism
about your part in the show,

00:46.296 --> 00:47.589
you've understood nothing.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.883
-No, clearly, I didn't understand a thing.
-Vicente.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.594
I'm an idiot
who doesn't get anything, right?

00:53.762 --> 00:56.347
-You guys can go to hell. I'm out.
-Where are you going?

00:56.431 --> 00:57.891
I resign. Fuck this shit!

00:59.184 --> 01:00.602
You can all fuck off. I'm done!

01:00.685 --> 01:01.978
Right. Vicente, please. Come on.

01:02.062 --> 01:02.896
Let's go.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.353
AGENT
XIMENA, CAREFUL WITH THE BAG

01:43.436 --> 01:45.188
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE AIRPORT

01:45.772 --> 01:49.400
-You're leaving now, girl?
-Dude, I gotta go. I'm really late.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.486
I can go to the airport with you.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.532
-No, you're not ready, and I have to go.
-I'll throw something on, and we'll go.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.244
Girl, I don't wanna drag this goodbye out.
Come on.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.330
No, wait, wait. No goodbye hug?

02:04.457 --> 02:07.544
I'll call you, okay? You know I will.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.255
Mm.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.012
Girl, go and kill it over there.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.973
Always.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.229
Checho.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.480
-Checho.
-What?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.274
There's something weird
about Ximena's trip.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.191
How so?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.527
I don't know. Before she left,
she got this random message.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.028
Something with her suitcase.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.406
-Where's she at?
-She just left.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.701
-You just let her?
-She wouldn't let me go with her.

02:41.953 --> 02:42.871
I'll get it, chill.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.791
-Hey.
-Hey, girl.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.294
-Uh, Liliana?
-She's inside.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.174
What are you doing here?

02:55.300 --> 02:58.469
No wonder
you didn't answer last night.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.805
-You good?
-For sure.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.683
We were exhausted,
and I didn't hear the phone ring.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.059
Thanks for the invite.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.353
What happened?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.480
I got a message from Joe.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.150
We got the audition
for the music video.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.029
Ximena left this morning.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.030
Where is she?

03:17.113 --> 03:19.866
She's left for the States
to live with her mama.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.492
Are you serious?

03:21.576 --> 03:23.703
I don't know.
Something's weird about this trip.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.706
The message on her cell this morning
was super strange.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.167
We can't just let Ximena leave.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.587
Let's go.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.756
Don't forget about what you said.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.883
Ignore that it hurts.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.136
Focus on the emotion. You got it.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.802
That was great.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.303
Great.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.808
Let's take five and grab some water,
then we'll get right back to it.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.603
You okay? You sure?

04:31.980 --> 04:32.855
Thanks.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.903
MIRANDA
BERNARDO ARRIVES IN AN HOUR

04:38.987 --> 04:41.739
AND WANTS TO MEET KARINA AND MATEO.
SEE YOU HERE

04:47.245 --> 04:52.250
MOM
I'M WAITING FOR YOU, MY LOVE.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.261
She won't answer.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.470
Try her again.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.519
It's turned off now. Son of a bitch!

05:13.688 --> 05:15.440
Man, that crazy bitch.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.108
I have an idea.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.486
But you're gonna have to trust me.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.707
Can I have your ID, please?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.842
And Miss Libia Alarcón,
you're going to the US, right?

06:24.926 --> 06:25.760
Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.027
Yeah, her passport.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.278
Does that look right?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.697
-This right here?
-Yeah.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.617
Oh, okay. I get it. Thanks.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.701
Mm-hmm.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.162
Um, this is perfect. Thanks.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.904
This way. Come on.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.090
Fuck, she's not here.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
Come on.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.888
WELCOME

08:00.605 --> 08:03.232
Hi there.
How much does this suitcase cost?

08:04.484 --> 08:07.570
Everyone have
their passport and boarding tickets out.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.238
Next, please.

08:11.741 --> 08:16.329
Hello, folks. Passengers going to Miami,
line up single file over here.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.500
Come in.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.377
Am I interrupting?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.796
Not at all. I was expecting you.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.589
-How are you, Bernardo?
-Well, I'm here.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.634
Welcome. We are very excited.

09:11.717 --> 09:15.805
We have two stars with a lot of potential,
and I know you're gonna love them both.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.473
Mm, perfect.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.854
Hey, hey, my passport was stolen!

09:23.938 --> 09:27.233
I'm gonna miss my flight!
Sir, can you please help us?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.151
-Yeah, just--
-What happened?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.820
-It's lost.
-I'm looking.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.531
-You okay? What happened?
-We have to board now.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.033
We've been robbed. We're gonna be late
getting to the terminal.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.119
Don't worry.
We'll get it figured out.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.454
Are you guys okay? What happened?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.164
We're fine,
but we've been robbed.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.917
-Just relax. What happened?
-Hey, wait! I know where I left them.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.378
Yes, in there--
I left them at the restaurant.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.255
-Thanks, sir.
-But you're okay? Wait.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.007
-She's so careless.
-Just a minute.

09:51.090 --> 09:51.966
Ximena.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.387
-Dude, what are you doing?
-Calm down. Let's go, I'll explain.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.019
-Come on, girl.
-No, man, I can't do that.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.479
-This is trouble now, come on.
-Hey, this isn't my bag.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.982
-Let's go now.
-Dude, where's my bag at?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.150
Let's go outside.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.328
We have to get rid of Ximena's suitcase.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.392
-Antonia, what the fuck is happening?
-What the hell, Ximena!

10:43.476 --> 10:46.562
Calm down, man. You know we just
saved your ass. You should say thank you.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.940
-You don't understand, dude. Stop.
-Look, why don't we talk somewhere else?

10:50.024 --> 10:52.234
This is fucked up.
We have to get out of here.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.905
You need it all explained
to your snobby ass, right?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.699
You should say thank you.
I did you a fucking favor.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.661
They'll kill me.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.789
What do you mean?
Who's going to hurt you?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.249
What are you into, huh?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.169
Um, we should go. Like, right now.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.880
And…

11:12.963 --> 11:16.384
Plus, I hate to bring it up,
but we're gonna be late to the audition.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.096
What audition?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.392
We booked the audition with Joe.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.062
I need to fix this stuff first.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.314
Ximena, you really need this audition.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.274
We all need this audition.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.736
You're not getting it, man.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.031
It'll be all right.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.242
Let's go, come on.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.829
There, look.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.333
And you guys?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.627
What do we do now?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.337
Let's go.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.034
All right, next two groups.
You guys, hurry up. Go ahead.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.080
What is this?
We're not the only ones?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.335
And you are?

12:34.545 --> 12:35.629
We're Pure Street.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.177
So, where's your fourth girl?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.391
Sorry, girls. You need a complete group.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.730
Don't you get it?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.398
I knew that something was up with you.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.112
-Why didn't you tell me before?
-Don't you talk to me like that.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.574
They'll kill me, Checho.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.536
Right now, I don't need a lecture.
I need your help.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.748
Not your sermons and bullshit.
Come on, dude. Really?

13:11.332 --> 13:14.293
Ximena, you know I'm between
a rock and a hard place too, don't you?

13:16.253 --> 13:17.963
Look, as much as I want to help…

13:19.715 --> 13:21.550
I'm not good with this shit.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.136
If you don't help me, then who will?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.723
<i> Karina.</i>

13:28.474 --> 13:29.475
Get ready.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.936
-We have a date.
-Who with?

13:32.019 --> 13:34.063
Miranda invited a potential investor.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.023
He wants to meet
the new stars of the show.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.483
So, you and Vicente.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.238
Yes, of course. That's cool. I just have
to step out, but I'll be right back.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.240
Fifteen minutes, and I'll be back.

13:44.740 --> 13:48.077
It's a big opportunity.
Don't be late, okay?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.955
I'll be waiting in Miranda's office.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.165
<i>Are you ready?</i>

13:53.249 --> 13:56.377
Karina is a bit late, but nothing serious.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.461
Well, how late?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.089
Only like, uh, ten or 15 minutes.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.427
Are you sure?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.722
We'll be ready.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.186
By the way, your lead actor quit.
We're going with Vicente.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.315
And what do we have here?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.028
You girls love improvising
way too much.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.906
Uh, can we have
the next two groups, please?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.009
What did I say?

14:45.593 --> 14:47.344
You need four people in your group.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.262
Chill.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.266
I almost wasn't, but now I'm here.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.148
What are you doing?

14:59.857 --> 15:00.774
Who called you?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.318
I called her.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.404
What, you don't want us to get this?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.489
Chill. I'm just here for my friends.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.241
Pure Street needs me.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.619
Let's go, dancers.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.124
All right, ready? Perfect.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.585
Let's go. Kuno's group first.
Front and center.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.424
Good job, guys. Okay, who's next?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
-Pure Street, ready?
-Yeah.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.560
Hey, I'm sorry. We need just a minute.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.147
The camera we're using just broke,
so if you could, hang out for a bit.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
How long will it be?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.943
What, are you in a hurry or something?

16:38.789 --> 16:39.790
Leave it alone.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.543
Don't call your mama. She'll just worry.

16:46.046 --> 16:50.509
Just chill, okay? Trust me.
Nothing is going to happen to you.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.349
Go get some rest, okay?
You're tired and stressed out.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.977
Go get some sleep
and I'll handle it, okay?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.069
Thanks.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.034
Just wait there.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.038
Checho.

17:20.039 --> 17:20.873
What's up, man?

17:22.332 --> 17:23.625
Grab a gun.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.300
Bernardo, meet our new Romeo.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.802
It's a pleasure. Vicente Flores.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.095
Pleasure. Bernardo.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.765
And Juliet? Where is she?

17:39.975 --> 17:41.185
She's almost here.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.940
FIVE MISSED CALLS

17:47.024 --> 17:50.027
All right. Pure Street, we're ready.
We're gonna start back up with you.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.111
Let's go.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.825
When did you say
she's going to be here?

18:01.580 --> 18:04.416
Karina, you said 15 minutes.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.585
It's been over an hour, girl.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.669
What happened?

18:08.378 --> 18:09.588
Where are you?

18:57.177 --> 18:58.011
And?

18:58.512 --> 18:59.346
And what?

19:00.347 --> 19:02.182
When do we find out if you chose us?

19:02.766 --> 19:04.810
Don't worry about it. We'll be in touch.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.728
Okay.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.232
Where's Karina?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.536
Chill, bro, that bitch is on the plane.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.705
-Just chill--
-Hang that shit up.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.833
And if she calls, don't answer, okay?

19:27.916 --> 19:29.877
Hang it the fuck up, dude.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.086
I'll call you.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.757
We finally meet, huh, shithead?

19:38.510 --> 19:39.928
Who do you work for?

19:41.805 --> 19:42.848
Who wants to know?

19:42.931 --> 19:46.185
Don't make this hard, you fucker.
Don't make me kill you.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.645
Who's bringing the dope to Miami?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.447
Me.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.033
My brother and me.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.576
Okay?

20:06.371 --> 20:08.832
Just chill, bro.
Can you put the gun away?

20:09.374 --> 20:10.209
Let's talk.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.712
We're gonna talk, that's cool.
Checho, put it away.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.839
But there's a problem.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.341
That you, my dear friend,

20:17.424 --> 20:20.427
involved yourself with the wrong chick,
you motherfucker.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.115
Finish this shit.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.084
-Sorry I'm late. I--
-You made me look like an idiot.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.585
Look, Jacob, I can--

20:53.669 --> 20:56.046
I don't think that you get
where you are, Karina.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.381
I do get it, but…

20:57.464 --> 21:01.093
-It was complicated and things--
-If things are getting too complicated,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.054
do me a favor and keep me in the loop.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.223
We can't go on like this.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.685
I've put too much on the line
to just throw my career away.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.147
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.858
I hope you're not confusing things.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.527
Go rest, okay?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.447
Damn it.

21:49.683 --> 21:54.604
MATEO
I'M REALLY UPSET. CAN YOU COME OVER?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.497
Thanks for coming.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.926
What's up? What's going on?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.471
I wanted to see you.

23:12.974 --> 23:13.809
Thanks.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.200
I can't stop thinking about her.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.248
I'm done with dancing.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.381
Don't say that.
Let me prove you wrong.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.639
So, what did the doctor say?

23:54.266 --> 23:58.645
Until the Iberoamericano is done,
I'm not going to a doctor.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.108
They gave me the lead role.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.326
Hey, dude!
Vicente, that's amazing!

24:14.244 --> 24:15.954
That's awesome. You deserve it.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.751
You really do.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.469
You see? You can do it.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.266
<i> You all know dance is my life.</i>

26:45.562 --> 26:49.816
<i>Because I want the company to recover</i>
<i>its place in the Iberoamericano.</i>

27:11.755 --> 27:13.381
Have you had many boyfriends?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.092
Boyfriends?

27:16.843 --> 27:17.677
No, none.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.222
I've had female friends. And you.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.641
Female friends?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.560
Well, I don't have
time or money for that, Vicente.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.354
Hmm?

27:28.021 --> 27:30.774
And now you have time?

27:41.368 --> 27:42.994
And what about your dream to…

27:44.245 --> 27:45.080
to dance?

27:46.581 --> 27:49.918
Because when I can't do it anymore,
you can replace me.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.003
Right?

27:58.259 --> 28:00.887
When your life's all set up like that,
it's easy.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.766
But when you're fighting for it
in the streets…

28:09.229 --> 28:11.064
Things aren't always what they seem.

28:12.774 --> 28:16.069
Well, it seems very different
from what I know.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.532
I don't really live.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.325
I survive.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.001
All right, but…

28:33.753 --> 28:35.088
can you really dance?

28:42.053 --> 28:44.222
-Don't laugh, okay?
-Mm.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.315
-Hi there, son.
-Dad, what are you doing here?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.654
-How are you doing?
-Good.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.240
Uh, Pop, this is Álex.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.868
-Good evening, Álex.
-Good evening.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.120
Nice to meet you.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.331
Yeah, a pleasure.

30:34.123 --> 30:36.960
Well, dude, I think--
I'm gonna catch you later, yeah?

30:37.043 --> 30:38.711
-Mm-hmm.
-Cool.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.464
-Uh, see you.
-Take care.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.601
<i>'Tis but thy name</i>
<i>that is my enemy.</i>

30:53.685 --> 30:55.854
<i>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</i>

30:56.688 --> 30:58.523
But what is a Montague?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.316
It is not hands

31:00.400 --> 31:04.195
nor foot nor arm,
nor any other part belonging to a man.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.200
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.704
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.330
<i>But what is a Montague?</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:20.211
<i>It is not hand nor foot nor arm,</i>
<i>nor any other part belonging to a man.</i>

31:23.506 --> 31:30.471
MIRANDA
INCOMING CALL

31:31.973 --> 31:33.099
He's not calling.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.352
Ya think?

31:47.196 --> 31:48.031
Hello?

31:50.867 --> 31:52.118
Yes, this is she.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.456
Uh-huh.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.792
Yeah, I understand.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.712
Great. Sure, yeah.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.966
Okay, thanks.

32:09.844 --> 32:10.678
What?

32:13.806 --> 32:14.641
They want us.

32:16.976 --> 32:18.353
Yes!

32:19.062 --> 32:21.230
-Oh my God!
-And rehearsals start tomorrow.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.441
That's so dope!

32:23.524 --> 32:25.485
Does Joe know I'll replace Karina?

32:26.069 --> 32:28.655
Mm, no, but I don't think it's a problem.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.576
Yeah, and let's not worry
about it right now.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.328
We'll just deal with it tomorrow, okay?

32:35.411 --> 32:36.621
Just relax.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.039
So what's up?

32:42.585 --> 32:45.797
Guess who the new dancers are
for Guaynaa's new music video?

32:45.880 --> 32:46.714
Mm.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.093
Well, congrats. You deserve it.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.015
I have good news for you.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.686
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

33:18.871 --> 33:20.540
What, did you find them?

33:23.084 --> 33:25.003
Look, did you guys kill him or what?

33:27.797 --> 33:29.674
Hey, stop asking stupid questions.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.138
Leave Mario alone.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.851
I can take care of myself.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.773
We have to show up
with killer choreography.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.150
Let's watch the video.

33:47.942 --> 33:51.029
It's your birthday, baby.
Yeah!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.531
What's happening in there?

33:56.951 --> 33:58.911
Did something happen last night?

33:58.995 --> 34:00.538
What do you want us to say?

34:01.706 --> 34:02.957
Just tell me the truth.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.800
Are you sleeping with Checho?

34:13.968 --> 34:14.802
No.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.597
He's fucking me.

34:19.348 --> 34:22.435
But don't trip, okay?
I'll be at that rehearsal tomorrow.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.563
With all I got.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.235
Dude.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.447
-Just go to hell.
-Hey, what's going on?

34:34.530 --> 34:36.491
-Leave me alone.
-Wait, what happened?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.993
-What's she gonna do, huh?
-Did she say anything?

35:12.985 --> 35:14.737
Yeah? Hello?

35:15.947 --> 35:16.989
Hello, Antonia.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.367
<i>I have a proposal for you.</i>
