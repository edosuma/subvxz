01:35.960 --> 01:38.120
In the days following
the June 30th revolution,

01:38.280 --> 01:41.560
there were clashes led by protesters
loyal to the society of Muslim Brothers

01:41.680 --> 01:43.360
opposing the peaceful
devolution of power.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.120
- What are you doing? Catch him.
- Don't move!

02:05.240 --> 02:07.040
- What's going on?
- Don't move!

02:07.600 --> 02:09.360
- Get 'em!
- Come here, boy.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.640
- I did nothing.
- Come here!

02:14.080 --> 02:16.560
- That guy is with him!
- Fine! Enough!

02:16.680 --> 02:18.560
What the hell? Stop pushing me!

02:18.680 --> 02:21.120
- Freeze!
- Get your hands off me.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.040
- I said, freeze!
- What is it?

02:23.160 --> 02:25.000
- We're with the press.
- Don't move!

02:25.120 --> 02:27.080
- Freeze!
- Who are you with?

02:27.200 --> 02:30.720
Associated Press.
I'm a reporter, and he's a photographer.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
Give me that camera!

02:38.320 --> 02:40.520
- They took pictures of us, sir.
- It's what we do!

02:44.160 --> 02:45.360
Give it here, Eweiss.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.320
- He's American.
- I'm also Egyptian, sir.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.600
A reporter at Associated Press.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.840
- Throw them in.
- What?

03:00.960 --> 03:03.320
- Get in!
- Let us call the embassy!

03:03.440 --> 03:05.480
- Do what you're told!
- In you go.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.920
- Freeze!
- Get in!

03:10.200 --> 03:12.039
- Hey, get in!
- No!

03:12.040 --> 03:14.120
- Enough!
- Enough. That's enough.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.680
Sir! Sir! Sir!

03:27.120 --> 03:30.360
Sir, call the last number I dialed
on my phone.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.560
He's the managing editor.
He'll confirm that I'm with the press.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.320
Sir! Sir!

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
Are you okay?

03:47.080 --> 03:50.680
Sir, call us a doctor! He can't breathe.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.280
Someone call an ambulance, please!

04:02.240 --> 04:06.640
Take it easy. Breath slowly, in and out.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.480
In and out. Hey, people!

04:13.000 --> 04:14.640
Take it easy.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.160
We were arrested
while trying to cover events.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.200
They took our camera and phones.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.880
Zein had a panic attack.
He's claustrophobic.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
Zein?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.040
What you're doing is stupid.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.360
Don't worry. They're distracted.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.560
Make sure there are no
privates coming my way.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.160
Hey, guys! Hey, guys!

05:30.600 --> 05:34.120
- Hey!
- Guys!

05:34.800 --> 05:39.200
- We're in the truck!
- Help! Help!

05:40.560 --> 05:42.240
Help! In here!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.360
It won't open.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.080
Another protest! Zein!

05:51.920 --> 05:55.000
Guys! Help!

05:56.160 --> 05:58.000
- Hey!
- Hey, people!

05:58.120 --> 06:00.440
Look at us! In the truck!

06:04.480 --> 06:06.000
Hey, people!

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
Yes! In here.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.840
- We need a phone.
- What are you doing here?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.960
- Were you arrested?
- Only by mistake.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.920
- They must be with the Muslim Brotherhood.
- I swear, we're not.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.200
Just one phone call
will clear all this up.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.120
- What's the number?
- Hold on, Nagwa.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.880
Now, look what the other one
is doing! Look!

06:25.920 --> 06:27.720
Stop being a stupid son of a bitch!

06:28.040 --> 06:29.840
Who are you with?

06:29.960 --> 06:31.520
- We're with the press.
- Press?

06:35.360 --> 06:40.840
- You traitors!
- You treasonous bastards!

06:40.960 --> 06:42.800
To hell with you!

06:46.440 --> 06:49.520
I have nothing to do with...

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
You animals!

06:54.680 --> 06:56.759
Fine. Just take it easy.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.720
Everyone,
I wanna see your phones and IDs.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.120
Sir, we're protesting with you!

07:01.240 --> 07:03.680
The Muslim Brotherhood
are with us now? God bless you!

07:03.800 --> 07:05.200
Sir, I swear, we're with you!

07:05.320 --> 07:11.000
The police and the people united!
The police and the people united!

07:12.280 --> 07:16.680
Sir, my son hasn't been home for a week.
I'm looking for him.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.800
- Look for him in the truck.
- What about my ID?

07:19.960 --> 07:22.559
- Sir, I have a child with me.
- I saw you throwing stones.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.080
- Sir, I swear, we didn't do anything!
- Come here. Didn't you throw stones?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.159
- We did.
- Throw them inside.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.240
- Take him in.
- Easy on the boy, please!

07:32.360 --> 07:34.680
- Take it easy!
- Put 'em in.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
Close the door.

07:38.880 --> 07:43.279
- Sir, we didn't throw any stones!
- Sir, I swear, we didn't throw anything.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.560
- We have nothing to do with this!
- There's Mom!

07:46.640 --> 07:49.080
Nagwa, go home!

07:49.360 --> 07:52.800
- Excuse me, where's the officer in charge?
- What is it?

07:52.920 --> 07:55.079
Please, sir, my husband and son
are locked inside.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.240
Your Muslim Brotherhood husband and son?
Go home, lady.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.320
- Muslim Brotherhood? They did nothing.
- Go home, lady.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.040
- I won't go home without my son!
- You need to leave!

08:03.160 --> 08:07.080
- No, I'm not leaving. Here we go!
- Nagwa, don't. Go home!

08:07.200 --> 08:10.880
- Shut up, Hossam!
- I saw you in the protest. Go home.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.760
Oh, you saw me? Yes, I was in the protest
throwing stones. Here I go again!

08:14.880 --> 08:17.159
Go home, you won't be able to help us.

08:17.160 --> 08:21.280
Get off me! I swear,
the next one will take off your head.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.440
- Take her inside.
- Get off me!

08:23.560 --> 08:24.760
Let's go.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.200
What the hell, Nagwa?

08:31.160 --> 08:34.000
- What were you doing?
- We did nothing.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.039
- Are you two Muslim Brotherhood?
- We're journalists.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.839
The same damn thing.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.960
- It's none of our business!
- Why did you throw stones at us?

08:42.080 --> 08:43.760
Because you're liars and traitors.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.600
We're no traitors, Hajj.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.960
- Why else would they arrest you?
- Well, they arrested you too.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.800
Then what's with the beard?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.519
These guys have beards, too,
are they Muslim Brotherhood as well?

08:53.520 --> 08:58.960
- What beard? Let me go, I'll teach him!
- Take it easy!

09:00.200 --> 09:02.280
Stop this shit, or I'm coming in there!

09:03.280 --> 09:06.800
- Don't touch the American guy!
- Enough, Zein.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.400
Enough, please.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.400
No more, or we'll all be damned.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.000
It says he's really a journalist.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.960
Did you expect it to say "spy"?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.120
Lieutenant,
there's a little kid with us.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.240
- Let him see your face.
- Come here, Faris.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.120
- Sir!
- There's a kid in here!

09:31.240 --> 09:33.320
Sir, the kid did nothing!

09:33.440 --> 09:35.520
- All troops to their vehicles.
- Attia!

09:36.720 --> 09:39.360
All troops to their vehicles.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.480
- Yes, sir. To your vehicles.
- Move!

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
- To your vehicles!
- Move!

10:03.880 --> 10:05.280
Where are we headed, Dad?

10:07.560 --> 10:11.000
I thought you were used to this.
I was told that you were an activist.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.720
An activist dies for a
cause, not a photo.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.840
A photo can serve a cause.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.600
But I came to cover the news,
not to be the news.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.680
I get it. Maybe it's because
this is our first time working together.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.280
And our last, I hope.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.960
- Is that a cellphone?
- Let's get away from the officer.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.040
Hello? We got arrested.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.640
We did nothing. They thought we were
the Muslim Brotherhood.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.480
- Tell Dad to do something.
- Wrap it up, dude.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.960
Reda, I'm talking to my family
to let them know I'm fine.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.640
Be quiet.
Don't tell Dad or it'll kill him.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.680
- Get off me, man. What the hell?
- It'll kill him.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.160
Can I use your phone for a minute?

11:06.520 --> 11:09.560
Can I talk to my family? Hajj Salah
and I only need one phone call.

11:09.680 --> 11:14.120
His wife just gave birth. He wants to
check up on her and tell her we're fine.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.800
I'm sorry, Hajj. Out of battery.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.559
Listen, if we tell the American Embassy
that we have an American journalist,

11:19.560 --> 11:20.999
they might cut us loose.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.240
I don't want any favors
from the American.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.759
Americans and the Muslim Brotherhood
walk hand in hand now?

11:25.760 --> 11:26.800
Let him call them.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.440
If I call them,
they'll only be able to get me out.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.079
My uncle is a general.
If I call him, he can get us all out.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.040
I have an influential friend.
He can get us out if I call him.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.680
No. Let him call his uncle, the general.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.960
Who would your father call anyway? Give
it here. His uncle's a damn general.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.560
- What about the officer?
- Forget about him.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.200
Just make it quick.
It's almost out of battery. Hurry.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.880
Hi, Mom. Ismail.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.320
I was arrested at a protest by mistake.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.599
It doesn't matter how. Just listen
to me. Call Uncle to get me out.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.440
To get us out! All of us, lady!

12:12.080 --> 12:16.440
Others were arrested too.
Tell Uncle about them.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.200
I'm fine. I ate something, I swear.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.640
- Forget about the phone.
- That's it. It's broken.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.919
Yeah, it's broken. Damn it, Ficho.
How did I get involved in all this?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.240
If it's your first protest
and it all goes to hell like this,

12:38.360 --> 12:40.239
- there's something wrong with you.
- Screw you.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.319
There's something wrong with Egypt,
not him.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.760
It's none of your business.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.080
It's broken.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.439
- Give it here.
- I swear, it's broken.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.720
- Do you even know this phone?
- It's my job. Give it.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.880
He's a technician
at my phone repair store. Don't worry.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.040
Don't worry. He'll fix it.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.200
Is your uncle gonna get us out?

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
He will.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.320
Excellent work, boss.
This your mom, buddy?

13:22.840 --> 13:26.120
Please, make it quick.
It'll run out of battery.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.480
Call only if you can help.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.800
Excuse me. Sorry. Thanks a lot, Hajj.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.000
- Get down, Faris.
- Don't worry. I'm holding on to him.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.679
One of us has to be responsible.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.879
Like getting yourself locked up
instead of getting help?

13:58.880 --> 14:02.880
- Was it responsible to drag him into this?
- We've been to 100 protests with him!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.079
- Now is not like back then.
- Enough, Mom.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.759
Then you should never have taken him
to a protest!

14:06.760 --> 14:08.440
- And leave my son alone?
- Alone?

14:08.560 --> 14:10.559
Are you crazy?
If he's with his father, he's alone?

14:10.560 --> 14:12.679
- Come here, Faris.
- Listen, mind your own business.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.399
You should all mind your own business!

14:14.400 --> 14:17.440
Come here. What's it got to do
with any of you? Mind your business.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
Fine.

14:36.120 --> 14:41.520
- Islam will prevail!
- Move it! Move it!

14:43.080 --> 14:46.680
- Islam will prevail!
- Go! Go! Go!

14:47.960 --> 14:50.200
Kill them all.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.680
Show them no mercy!

14:53.520 --> 14:55.480
Islam will prevail!

14:57.520 --> 14:58.880
Islam will prevail!

15:03.600 --> 15:05.200
ISLAM WILL PREVAIL

15:15.240 --> 15:20.200
Police are thugs! Police are thugs!

15:24.240 --> 15:26.000
Islam will prevail!

15:27.520 --> 15:29.160
Police are thugs!

15:32.520 --> 15:35.920
Justice for our Brothers,
or death for us all!

15:36.040 --> 15:39.200
Justice for our Brothers,
or death for us all!

16:03.400 --> 16:05.240
Allahu Akbar!

16:05.960 --> 16:08.000
Allahu Akbar!

16:11.800 --> 16:13.240
Allahu Akbar!

16:53.280 --> 16:54.640
My phone!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.320
Get in.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.398
Islam will prevail!

17:04.400 --> 17:06.960
Catch them, they're the ones
who abducted my son!

17:08.359 --> 17:09.359
Come here.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.079
Dad!

17:13.079 --> 17:14.079
I did nothing.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.319
- I didn't hit anyone.
- Islam will prevail!

17:19.800 --> 17:21.359
I didn't hit anyone!

17:21.720 --> 17:23.520
Whose side are you on?

17:25.119 --> 17:28.079
- Islam will prevail!
- Dad!

17:30.480 --> 17:33.320
Don't separate us. Dad!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.520
Dad!

17:38.640 --> 17:44.680
Dad! Take me with him!

17:45.240 --> 17:51.279
Hajj! Dad! Lock him in here with me!

17:51.280 --> 17:53.000
- Bastards!
- You're the bastard.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.400
Open the door. Come on.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.240
Close it.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.320
That's enough!

18:05.920 --> 18:08.680
People, this isn't right! Enough.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.320
Are you just gonna stand there?
Get them off us!

18:19.440 --> 18:20.440
Hossam!

18:22.200 --> 18:24.360
I swear to God...

18:31.040 --> 18:33.040
Enough. Stop.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.600
Get off me! What the hell?

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
Help!

18:42.400 --> 18:44.200
Help!

18:44.400 --> 18:46.360
Get off!

18:50.200 --> 18:53.000
Get off me!

18:53.640 --> 18:54.880
Oh, dear God!

18:55.280 --> 18:57.880
Help! Open the door!

18:58.320 --> 19:02.000
Open the door, they're killing us!

19:02.440 --> 19:04.679
- Get away!
- Stop it right now!

19:04.680 --> 19:07.000
I said stop!

19:10.440 --> 19:12.040
Go ahead. You're clear.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.920
Don't worry.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.040
What, you wanna kill each other
and pin it on us, as usual?

20:29.160 --> 20:31.840
- We're not Muslim Brotherhood, sir.
- Sure you're not.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.719
Please, there are kids here. If they don't
get out, something terrible will happen.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.960
- My daughter is 14 years old.
- Happy birthday, then.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.280
Now, you're making a fuss
'cause you're American, right?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.640
This is all your doing after all.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.040
- I'm Egyptian.
- Oh, really?

20:46.160 --> 20:47.960
Why didn't you say so before?

20:54.160 --> 20:59.440
Don't lock the door. If they assault
each other, they'll blame us and sue us.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.680
- And if they do this again, open fire.
- Copy that, sir. Let's move.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
Let's go!

21:13.760 --> 21:17.480
DO YOU NOT FEAR GOD, YOU UNJUST PEOPLE?

21:17.600 --> 21:22.160
IBRAHIM, FAHIM
6/9/2009

22:16.920 --> 22:19.639
- Just hold tight.
- No.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.480
May God punish the tyrants!

22:22.600 --> 22:24.640
Who's paying you, thug?

22:25.040 --> 22:27.960
- Your mother!
- Easy, tiger. You'll get us in trouble.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.080
Take it easy.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.280
- Let it go.
- Hey!

22:36.080 --> 22:38.240
- Hey.
- What is it?

22:41.680 --> 22:44.240
- Does my hair look good?
- Your hair?

22:45.520 --> 22:48.480
- It's the best.
- What the hell, man?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.320
Well, is this the time
to check your hair?

22:52.880 --> 22:55.200
I don't get it.
You took a little girl to the protest?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.480
- I'm not a little girl.
- Little girl?

22:58.640 --> 23:02.040
- She's worth a hundred men.
- Please, don't talk to me or my father.

23:05.240 --> 23:10.040
- Get off me, Mom. I'm not a kid.
- We need a doctor, people.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.880
Is there a doctor here?

23:20.960 --> 23:22.120
My mom is a nurse.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.640
Don't say another word.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.160
Go ahead.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.760
Make way, people.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.720
No, miss. No touching.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.680
Give me this.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.720
You must put pressure on the wound.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.080
Make it tight, so you'll stop bleeding.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.160
May God reward you.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.720
You must like it here
in this truck, right?

24:05.440 --> 24:06.440
Certainly not.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.919
You wanna be the hero reporter,
but you don't understand

24:09.920 --> 24:12.600
that you may not get out alive
to enjoy being seen as a hero.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.440
A few days ago, in a car like this,
37 people were killed.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.560
You don't know me very well.

24:22.920 --> 24:23.920
Okay.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.040
There! There's a car over
there, Huzaifa!

24:46.520 --> 24:49.479
- Guys! Brothers! Is my dad with you?
- What is it?

24:49.480 --> 24:50.760
Hajj Hamza!

24:52.800 --> 24:54.559
Huzaifa, are you okay?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.920
- I'm okay. Are you?
- I am. It's not my first rodeo.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.159
- Is that your brother, Malik, with you?
- No, Hajj, I'm Tamir.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.079
Well, where's Malik, then?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.360
- I thought he was with you, Hajj.
- No.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.039
Don't worry. What's important
is that you take care of yourself.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.879
- Don't worry.
- God help you guys!

25:09.880 --> 25:13.000
I hear another car coming!
Excuse me.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.720
Guys! Brothers!
Is Malik El-Qaffas with you?

25:46.640 --> 25:48.440
- No, he's not here.
- Has anyone seen him?

25:49.440 --> 25:51.999
Who's your leader?
I'm Dr. Suhaib Shokry.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.400
- Dr. Suhaib.
- Dr. Suhaib.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.280
Is he, like, your Eminem?

25:56.760 --> 25:58.720
How are you, Doctor?

25:59.240 --> 26:02.680
- Are you okay?
- I am. Did you get organized?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.279
- Not yet.
- Well, hurry up.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.199
I want the names
of all the Brothers arrested.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.200
- You got it, Doctor.
- Right.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.120
Can all Brothers in this car gather
so we can organize ourselves?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.600
- You're with the Muslim Brotherhood?
- I am.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.760
Are you a Brother, sir?

26:18.480 --> 26:21.199
I've been with you since the beginning.
I voted for you.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.120
It's not about voting. I mean,
are you a regular member

26:24.240 --> 26:26.839
- in a district who pays his dues?
- He's sympathetic to our cause.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.839
But I am a regular member.
Mohammed is my brother.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.800
Well, excuse me,

26:30.920 --> 26:33.720
we're gonna stand on one side.
This side is for official members only.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.720
Just hold on, Mohammed.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.280
If there are
any other official members here,

26:42.400 --> 26:44.120
please, join us and raise your hands.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.719
Excuse me, sir,
will you stand over there?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.720
- What difference does it make?
- It's fine, Dad.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.680
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.720
- Let's state our names and seniority.
- Tamir El-Noamani.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.159
Maghagha district, Minya province.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.479
Ahmed Hashem, an active member
in the Matrouh province.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.440
Huzaifa El-Qaffas, a regular member
in the Matariya district.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
No.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.160
So, you're with them.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.640
So, if we're not with you,
we're with them?

27:23.920 --> 27:25.640
Will you please change sides?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.680
Sure. Fine. Let's go, Zein.

27:35.480 --> 27:41.480
Oh, sorry. If you could just uncuff me,
I'll go anywhere you want.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.240
Let's take this side then, guys.
Come on.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.160
- Why don't we go on stating our names?
- Moaz Sabbet, member in Imbaba district.

27:56.280 --> 27:59.520
Omar Mansour, member in Nasr City.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.360
That means you've been a member
for more than three years.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.680
You could blind someone with that thing.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.560
- How old are you?
- Older than you.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.200
In our school,
we play Army versus Brotherhood.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.360
Us too.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.360
But we used to execute
all Brotherhood loyalists.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.800
We slaughter soldiers on sight.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.520
It seems Mr. Moaz has seniority.
He'll be in charge of us in the truck.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.160
Sure. Go ahead.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.600
I speak for all Brotherhood members
in the truck.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.679
As for our supporters,
do you mind if I speak for you?

28:40.680 --> 28:42.320
Not at all. Go ahead.
God bless you all.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.839
First of all, could our supporters turn
their armbands to the red side,

28:46.840 --> 28:48.840
just to distinguish themselves
from members.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.120
God bless you.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.280
Secondly, if we hope to make it today,
there must be rules.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.879
Screw you all! How's that for a rule?

29:03.880 --> 29:05.679
- Mind your words.
- Have some respect.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.400
- What do you want anyway?
- We'll take one side, you take the other.

29:08.520 --> 29:11.840
- Just to make sure there are no fights.
- We've been holding back so far.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.160
- That's it!
- Just stop talking.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.160
- Back off, man.
- Make this guy get rid of the blade.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.040
Here's the blade.
You're all welcome to try and take it.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.760
- Make him stop talking.
- Unlike you,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.720
we don't give orders
to force people to do anything.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.840
- Have some respect, please.
- You have no respect.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.280
"Orders," he says.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.760
What's going on? Stop it.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.479
Your idea of staying
on different sides is weird.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.520
Didn't we agree
that I would speak for all of us?

29:40.800 --> 29:43.720
- No, we didn't.
- I've been given consent to speak for us.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.720
I speak for our members and supporters.
Or are you not one of them?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.520
Will you please go to the other side?

29:54.520 --> 29:57.639
- Let's go.
- Just sit, man!

29:57.640 --> 30:02.760
Hey, Private! This guy keeps messing
with us. He wants to make a scene.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.680
We don't want any problems.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.039
- We want nothing to do with them.
- Back off, all of you!

30:07.040 --> 30:12.280
He keeps giving us the finger,
and we have women in the truck.

30:12.400 --> 30:16.800
- No, he's lying, I swear.
- Back the hell off!

30:17.560 --> 30:18.840
Have some dignity!

31:00.120 --> 31:03.600
- What's wrong, Radwan?
- I can't, Hajj. I can't hold it.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.600
Sir! Officer!

31:14.400 --> 31:19.320
- Sir! Officer!
- Get back inside.

31:20.040 --> 31:24.240
Someone needs to pee,
he can't hold it anymore.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.919
- He can't hold it? Is he a child?
- He's diabetic, sir.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.720
- You get arrested, then you fake illness.
- Is this who you mean?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.439
Is this who you mean when you talk
about terrorists, you criminals?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.799
- I swear, you are the criminal.
- Don't disrespect my father.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.319
- To hell with your father.
- Shut it!

31:37.320 --> 31:38.960
- You have no manners!
- Fuck off.

31:39.080 --> 31:42.360
I said shut it! Get in that truck. Go.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.400
- Sir.
- Please, Uncle,

31:45.520 --> 31:47.320
don't give us any trouble. Get inside.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.080
I'm sorry, son.
We're waiting for the officer.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.960
This isn't the time. Deal with him.

31:59.280 --> 32:03.079
He can make do with this. And wait with
your daughter till things settle down.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.480
- This is wrong.
- Shut up.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.719
I'll get her home later because I also
have kids, not because it's an injustice.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.799
- And my son, sir.
- Here he is.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.120
Your son and your wife.
Just wait until things settle down.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.640
- Here. Use this.
- It's so dirty, Hajj.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.640
Don't be picky, Radwan. Go on.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.680
Yeah, but it's very small,
how can I use it?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.160
- Dear Lord!
- Sir.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.400
Here, I'll show you how.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.240
Come with me.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.160
Look, you unzip your pants,

32:52.960 --> 32:54.440
and then you aim like this.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.600
Here.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.960
- Mr. Omar, can I talk to you?
- Sure. Come here.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
What is it, brother?

33:36.600 --> 33:40.239
Mr. Omar, can the president really
return to power?

33:40.240 --> 33:44.599
- Of course. He will.
- But all odds are against us. How?

33:44.600 --> 33:47.800
We don't believe in odds, we believe
in the God who shapes the odds.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.840
Have faith in God. These are
the devil's thoughts. Be still.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.200
What's this?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.080
What are you recording?
Is that a camera?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.000
It's not a camera. It's a watch.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.159
- You have a camera?
- What camera?

34:08.159 --> 34:10.920
- Do you see anyone taking photos?
- You have a camera?

34:11.320 --> 34:12.319
Give it here.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.399
It's just a little camera for work.
It's not a big deal.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.239
- No cameras.
- Break it or I will.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.159
- No one is breaking any cameras.
- Form a chain.

34:21.239 --> 34:25.560
- Take a look at this.
- Private!

34:26.600 --> 34:28.159
The Americans have a camera.

34:28.719 --> 34:32.998
Please, wait. This camera can save us all.
If this goes unrecorded, it didn't happen.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.360
- Screw you and your camera.
- Give me that camera.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.880
There's no god but Allah.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.760
Ambulance! Ambulance!

35:05.400 --> 35:06.520
Ambulance!

35:06.920 --> 35:08.760
The shooter is up there.
On top of the tank.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.880
There he is.
On top of the tank to your left.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.080
There he is.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.519
Officer! I saw him!

35:18.520 --> 35:19.880
He's standing up there, guys.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.120
- There he is, guys!
- Up there.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.680
He's up there.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.760
Be careful! Incoming!

35:33.000 --> 35:36.640
- Incoming!
- Shut up!

35:45.240 --> 35:49.200
Help! Move the truck!

35:51.880 --> 35:53.760
Move the truck.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.720
Huzaifa, are you okay, son?

36:16.080 --> 36:19.079
- I'm okay. Are you?
- Take care of yourself.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.759
- Are the Brothers okay?
- We're okay. Thank God.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.320
The sniper must be
a method of incriminating us.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.840
We know. He must be with the police.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.760
What about this one? Is he also police?

36:29.160 --> 36:30.719
Not every bearded guy's
with the Brotherhood.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
Gimme the camera.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.720
- The camera.
- There are no cameras.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.159
- Someone stop the truck!
- Stop the truck!

36:37.160 --> 36:40.240
- Stop the truck!
- Stop the truck, people!

36:40.560 --> 36:42.720
- Stop the truck!
- Someone stop the truck.

36:42.840 --> 36:47.000
Stop! Farghali! Farghali!

36:48.920 --> 36:49.960
Stop!

36:59.760 --> 37:01.520
Don't die. Wake up!

37:02.720 --> 37:05.520
Wake up. Come here.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.600
- Is it my mother?
- No.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.480
- His father?
- No. Ficho.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.199
Someone please uncuff me!

37:31.200 --> 37:33.080
Private! Where's the officer
who was just here?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.680
Where's the officer?

37:35.960 --> 37:38.480
He said he'd release us.
We have kids here.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.160
Someone help him. His head is bleeding.
He's gonna die.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.960
- There's a nurse here.
- No, no nurses here.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.600
- Tamir, get down.
- Why?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.280
I'm responsible for you,
and I said so.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.840
Is it right for them to kill us
and wrong for us to defend ourselves?

38:13.960 --> 38:18.600
Yeah, nice act, pal.
You're a bunch of good actors.

38:18.720 --> 38:23.480
You afraid they'll call you terrorists?
That's an honor beyond your reach!

38:23.600 --> 38:26.280
Tamir, get away from the window.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.960
Are you the colonel's wife?

38:49.600 --> 38:50.800
My sincere condolences.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.760
Ambulance!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.160
Someone's dying here! He's bleeding out.

38:58.280 --> 39:02.720
If I hear one more word,
I'll gas you and lock the door.

39:03.960 --> 39:07.200
Start the truck. Move all the trucks.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.960
Push it! Move it!

39:13.400 --> 39:15.560
Push the car! Go!

39:49.920 --> 39:53.400
Move faster past the door and windows.
We all want fresh air.

40:10.680 --> 40:16.280
- Soldier, get some water for you and us.
- For us too.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.840
Here. Take all the money
and get us a bottle of water at least.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.680
You must be thirsty too. Take it.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.280
Take your money and back off.
We don't work for you.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.720
Don't take money from anyone.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.480
- Hey, where are you from, buddy?
- The Fifth Settlement.

40:36.760 --> 40:40.240
If you're throwing any parties
or have any anniversaries, I'm DJ Mans.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.600
If you have an anniversary,
I'm DJ Mans.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.320
- Here, sir. Here you go.
- Are you popular?

40:47.440 --> 40:50.080
Here. Yeah.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.640
What DJ? You have no equipment.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.439
You've got an LED belt
and you printed some cards.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.319
Isn't it better than being a football
fan, lazing around in coffee shops?

40:59.320 --> 41:02.040
Being a football fan, an Ahly fan,
is an honor.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.800
Al-Ahly is the best, man.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.840
- Was the best.
- Zamalek is coming for you.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.680
- To get their asses handed to them?
- When you talk football, you talk Zamalek.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.520
My father used to tell me
that Al-Ahly were the best.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.960
Now, your father gets it.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.479
This is intolerable, people!

41:28.480 --> 41:33.320
- What is it?
- It stinks! And you say you're peaceful?

41:33.760 --> 41:36.600
It smelled like this all day,
and it came from your side,

41:36.720 --> 41:40.080
- and we didn't say anything!
- Enough, people. There are women here.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.200
- This isn't from the Brotherhood's side.
- What, don't they ever fart?

42:32.000 --> 42:34.400
- Huzaifa.
- Father!

42:35.720 --> 42:38.160
I'm worried about your brother, Malik.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.640
Don't worry about him, Hajj.
He'll be fine, God willing.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.960
You sound tired, Hajj.
Try to get some rest.

42:45.520 --> 42:52.280
How can I rest, son? There are about
50 of us crammed in this truck.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.040
You'll be fine, God willing.

42:54.760 --> 42:58.040
Guys, please, take care of my father.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.200
He's very tired.
Try to make him comfortable.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.760
Pick any spot in the truck
and rest in it, Hajj.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.720
You'll be fine, God willing.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.240
- Well done!
- Well done. Now, let's move.

43:28.800 --> 43:33.400
Where are you going, man?
Start the car.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.920
- Nagwa.
- Start the car, man.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.080
- Nagwa.
- Where are you going?

43:40.640 --> 43:42.560
Where are you going? Where to?
Start the car.

43:42.680 --> 43:45.360
- Start the car!
- Get back in! We're doing it now.

43:45.520 --> 43:49.519
- No, people are suffering in there!
- Lady, you're making a mistake!

43:49.520 --> 43:52.079
- You got yourself into this mess!
- I need to speak with someone!

43:52.080 --> 43:53.880
All prisons and precincts are full!

43:54.000 --> 43:58.640
- It's too hot in there!
- We're waiting for orders to move!

43:58.760 --> 44:01.160
- It's too hot.
- Said, get some water, hurry up!

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
Hurry up!

44:07.000 --> 44:08.360
Get back in, lady.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.720
- Come here, Faris. Drink.
- Pass the water, please.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.680
Back here, people.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.920
One sip per person, guys. Hey.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.360
Can we have some, please?

44:27.480 --> 44:29.119
- Yeah.
- Please.

44:29.120 --> 44:32.520
- Don't drink it all, please.
- One sip per person.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.760
- Some water here, please.
- Take it easy.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.360
- Some water here, people!
- Just a second. What the hell?

44:40.080 --> 44:43.520
Some water here, please, guys.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.600
Did you cool down?

44:59.960 --> 45:02.440
- Yeah.
- You'll feel it now.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.760
He died. Someone just died. Help!

45:18.720 --> 45:20.880
- Dad.
- Air! Some air!

45:22.320 --> 45:23.320
Hajj Hamza!

45:25.000 --> 45:29.680
Hajj Hamza! Answer me!

45:31.480 --> 45:35.960
Open the door for them!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.560
Dad!

45:43.320 --> 45:44.360
Dad!

45:51.120 --> 45:52.960
He needs air.

45:53.640 --> 45:57.800
- We can't breathe.
- It's Sameh. Tarik's friend.

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
Help!

45:59.720 --> 46:03.680
- Sameh! Sameh! Sameh!
- We can't breathe!

46:04.000 --> 46:07.520
I'm Uncle Salah, Sameh!
Is my son with you?

46:08.000 --> 46:11.640
- Were you arrested together?
- Help us, Uncle Salah!

46:13.360 --> 46:14.800
We can't breathe.

46:15.880 --> 46:20.840
Open the door for them!

46:20.960 --> 46:22.840
- Get back inside.
- They're dying in there.

46:22.960 --> 46:26.439
- You're just an old man. Get back inside!
- Open the door!

46:26.440 --> 46:27.640
Get inside, Hajj.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.040
- Help, people!
- Open the door for them.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.680
Tell them to go to the windows.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.479
- Go to the windows.
- The windows.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.240
- Open the door.
- We're dying, I swear.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.600
- Open the door.
- Open the door, soldier.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.600
- Open the door.
- Sir.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.759
Open the damn door, they're dying.

46:48.760 --> 46:51.440
- Go to the windows!
- Take turns.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.800
Get back.
They'll have you court-martialed.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.040
- Go to the windows!
- Let them breathe!

46:58.480 --> 47:00.800
- Open the door, soldiers!
- Get back.

47:01.160 --> 47:05.200
- They won't die, God willing.
- Get back!

47:07.360 --> 47:09.520
He's new, sir. He's just new.

47:10.160 --> 47:13.080
- Get off me!
- Let go!

47:13.560 --> 47:15.960
- Open the door.
- We're gonna die.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.920
- Open the door.
- Sir!

47:20.880 --> 47:24.040
- Sir!
- We're gonna die!

47:24.520 --> 47:28.440
- Open the door!
- Open the windows!

47:28.720 --> 47:30.040
Help!

47:31.480 --> 47:33.040
Please, open the door!

48:14.120 --> 48:19.160
- Sameh.
- Hajj Hamza El-Qaffas.

48:19.440 --> 48:21.360
- Sameh.
- Hajj Hamza!

48:22.760 --> 48:23.760
Dad.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
Dad.

48:27.640 --> 48:32.039
Answer me, Hajj. Answer me, please.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.040
Sameh!

48:34.560 --> 48:37.520
- Sameh!
- Sameh.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.000
Boys? Let us know that you're okay.

48:41.720 --> 48:46.320
- Hajj Hamza.
- What's that on your back?

48:51.040 --> 48:54.640
- Torture?
- How old is your son?

48:55.440 --> 48:59.240
- Seventeen years old.
- A young man, God bless him.

48:59.960 --> 49:03.399
My son, Talha, is older than him, a
college student. What grade is your son?

49:03.400 --> 49:04.720
He's a junior in high school.

49:06.080 --> 49:10.480
I didn't get to see my son
go to high school or junior high.

49:10.680 --> 49:13.160
- Why?
- Why do you think, Hajj?

49:13.280 --> 49:14.680
Obviously, he was in prison.

49:16.520 --> 49:19.800
Don't worry. God willing,
your son will be safe and sound.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.040
He's following the right path.

49:24.200 --> 49:27.120
- But my son doesn't support your cause.
- He doesn't?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.000
And I'm not fat!

49:32.400 --> 49:35.760
Sameh! Sameh!

49:37.200 --> 49:38.280
Sameh!

49:39.520 --> 49:42.920
Sameh! Sameh!

49:44.760 --> 49:46.120
Sameh, are you there?

49:47.880 --> 49:49.080
Sameh!

50:12.560 --> 50:15.320
- You're bleeding.
- A lot?

50:15.440 --> 50:16.440
Yeah.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.079
- Open your mouth.
- I'm okay.

50:23.080 --> 50:28.560
Open up. Holy crap!
Your mouth is all cut up.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.520
Are you new
to this blade-in-the-mouth thing?

50:31.600 --> 50:32.800
I'm a pro.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.080
- Why are you pretending to be a thug?
- I am a thug.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.480
- No, you're not.
- Keep it down.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.960
I'm only doing this to scare them off.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.720
What are you, then?

50:49.280 --> 50:52.040
I clean cars
when they're waiting in traffic.

50:53.760 --> 50:57.200
How does a guy like you
end up in a fight with those idiots?

50:58.960 --> 51:02.080
A Muslim Brotherhood protest
marched nearby.

51:02.280 --> 51:08.200
And there were lots of fights,
and my dog was killed.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.920
What was your dog doing at a protest?

51:15.400 --> 51:19.320
I've always been alone, you know.
He was the only friend I ever had.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.040
He was kinder than most people.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.640
My late father gave him to me.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.600
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to him,

51:35.040 --> 51:37.560
Rocky. What did you call your dog?

51:39.720 --> 51:41.840
- Scabies.
- Scabies?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.120
Did he have scabies?

51:49.040 --> 51:50.600
- You want it?
- May I?

52:14.720 --> 52:18.600
Aisha. Aisha?

52:20.080 --> 52:21.200
Are you okay?

52:23.320 --> 52:27.600
Aisha! What's wrong, child?

52:34.800 --> 52:36.480
Do you need to use the bathroom?

52:41.360 --> 52:43.360
She needs to use the bathroom.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.760
Soldier.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.320
Soldier.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.440
Soldier.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.200
- Yes, Hajj?
- My daughter needs to use the bathroom.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.079
- I can't let that happen, Hajj.
- Why not?

53:06.080 --> 53:09.799
- She's a girl, she can't use a bottle.
- It's all we got.

53:09.800 --> 53:12.080
What do you mean, you can't
let that happen? You can.

53:12.200 --> 53:15.999
- The girl must go to the bathroom.
- I'll ask the officer when he arrives.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.640
What do you mean? You're all men here!
Don't you have any sisters?

53:21.800 --> 53:26.040
I can't let that happen. We have orders!
If you don't back off, I'll lock the door.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.000
This is wrong, guys. She's a girl.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.640
- I swear, we'll get out of here!
- You'll let her out!

53:31.760 --> 53:33.120
Let her out, man. What's the harm?

53:33.240 --> 53:36.600
- What if she were your sister, soldier?
- Get back, Awad.

53:37.160 --> 53:41.199
- Awad!
- Come here. Hurry up. You're going home.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.320
There's a little kid here.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.919
- You, too.
- God bless you.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.360
- Awad!
- God bless you.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.960
- Eweiss, open the door!
- I won't, Awad.

53:50.080 --> 53:53.360
- Open the damn door, Eweiss!
- You're gonna get us all in trouble!

53:53.480 --> 53:55.880
For your mother's sake,
open the door, Eweiss! Stop this!

53:57.560 --> 53:58.760
Eweiss!

54:06.160 --> 54:10.440
Guys, let's help her.
We'll all face the other way.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.680
- Okay.
- How?

54:13.800 --> 54:16.480
- It's possible. It could work.
- We're gonna form a wall?

54:16.600 --> 54:18.360
- Yes, exactly.
- Here, Nagwa.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.200
- Okay.
- Let's go. Don't worry.

54:21.360 --> 54:24.800
- Make room, people.
- Make way, please.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.440
Make way, guys.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.960
- Let's go, people.
- Make way.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.800
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

54:42.840 --> 54:44.000
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.120
Did you do it?

55:18.400 --> 55:19.600
Come here.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.480
Bring her.

55:38.320 --> 55:41.840
Islam will prevail! Islam will prevail!

55:48.840 --> 55:50.920
- What are you doing?
- Taking you home.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.120
Be careful. Come here.

56:04.520 --> 56:07.400
- Where are you going? You'll get killed.
- We'll die if we stay.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.880
Nagwa, calm down and come back.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.840
You're fine. Don't be scared.

56:21.640 --> 56:24.360
I'm okay. Don't worry.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.720
Get away from me, Nagwa.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.920
Dad! Dad!

56:40.400 --> 56:41.520
Dad!

56:44.400 --> 56:45.720
Get in, Eweiss.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.239
Help me. Don't leave me.

56:47.240 --> 56:50.080
- I'm not leaving you. I'll be back.
- Awad!

56:53.120 --> 56:55.520
Dad! Dad!

56:56.160 --> 56:57.760
Excuse me.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.080
Leave him. We'll take care of him.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.680
- Excuse me.
- Let him breathe.

57:02.800 --> 57:05.280
- You're with your people.
- Raise his head up.

57:06.240 --> 57:09.920
Dad! Dad!

57:19.040 --> 57:23.480
Dad! Dad!

57:24.520 --> 57:25.600
Dad!

57:37.160 --> 57:39.040
Retribution is a bullet!

57:40.320 --> 57:42.200
Retribution is a bullet!

57:43.680 --> 57:45.680
Retribution is a bullet!

57:47.080 --> 57:49.000
Retribution is a bullet!

57:50.400 --> 57:52.160
Retribution is a bullet!

58:27.480 --> 58:31.080
You have a fractured rib. Don't move.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.400
Hide your cross.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.200
Your fellow soldier is under fire.

59:12.320 --> 59:16.160
Soldier down! Soldier!

59:16.280 --> 59:18.400
Soldier, save yourself!

59:18.920 --> 59:21.640
Over here, Awad.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.000
Run, soldier! They're gonna kill you!

59:30.480 --> 59:31.960
Use the laser, guys.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.880
Don't you have a pointer? Tell me!

59:42.680 --> 59:45.360
Here, Awad.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.040
Here!

59:49.280 --> 59:51.360
- Run!
- Run, soldier.

59:51.480 --> 59:54.760
- Fire!
- Get back to the cabin!

59:55.240 --> 59:57.640
That's it! Run!

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.520
- Save yourself!
- Run!

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.000
Get in and start the truck!

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.640
- I don't know how to drive!
- Get down.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.080
Get down!

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.840
God, help me!

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.520
They're throwing teargas, guys!

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.000
- Gas?
- Close the windows.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.520
The windows, get down.
Get away from the window.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.280
- You'll get us all killed.
- Move, you'll get us killed!

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.800
- Move away!
- Try to help him. I can't reach him!

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.880
Zein, Zein.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.040
What's America like? A concrete forest?

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.080
There are trees everywhere.
Lots of green and forests.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.280
- Are there seas there, like here?
- There are no seas.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.440
Two oceans, though.
One in the east, one in the west.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.440
- Have you been in a skyscraper?
- Once or twice.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.560
- How about the girls?
- Lots of girls.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.760
How does one get there?

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.559
- Yeah, how?
- He's American, he doesn't need a visa.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.920
- Exactly.
- Why did you come back to this hole, then?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.160
I used to see my dad go crazy
whenever someone mentioned Egypt.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.240
"Terrible place!"

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.720
He used to tell me how he was tortured
under Abdel-Nasser's rule.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.640
He cursed the chaos,
the nepotism and the corruption.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.400
But despite all of that,
his last wish was to be buried here.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.520
- And he was.
- May he rest in peace.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960
Thanks.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.320
- Hey, Zein, you okay?
- I am, thank God.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.240
- Why is my head spinning?
- They've imported new gas.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.120
It gets you high, apparently.
You missed out on the funniest time.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.200
We need to close the wound.
I'll have to staple it.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520
Hold tight.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.360
Do you have any pins?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.600
Godspeed.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.160
- You'll get better.
- You'll contaminate the wound.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.960
My hair keeps falling out.
How long do I have left?

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.440
I don't know.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.520
I remember that you were bald
by the age of 27, 28.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.480
My barber tells me there's a cream you
can apply to keep it from falling out.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.920
Who's that? Saad?

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.880
Another barber.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.160
- Is he a Muslim Brother?
- He is.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.120
Forget it. You're gonna be bald like me.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.560
- But he says...
- Doesn't matter what he says.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.320
It runs in the family.
It's out of both our hands.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.880
More gas?

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.480
- Do you see anything?
- Don't open the windows.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.920
Hey.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.120
- Let him call his mom.
- Didn't she say she'd call you?

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.840
She must've done something.
Maybe she ran out of credit.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.480
- Hurry up.
- Just hide it.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.640
Here. Don't come to me
if it runs out of battery.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:41.840
Hi. Yes, Mom. In the same place.
What do you mean, you can't do anything?

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.880
Who can then? Make him call someone,
even the minister himself.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.360
- We're dying here.
- That's it.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.760
Will you give it back, please?

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.240
- Tell him it's the last call.
- No. I swear, I can't.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.320
I'll call my uncle myself. Guys.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.680
This my sister's number?
What are these messages?

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.280
- Just give it to me.
- Back off, Mans.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.760
Wait. You'll get the wrong idea.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.280
- You'll get the wrong idea, I swear.
- What are these messages?

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.760
- I swear, we're in love.
- In love?

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.280
- I swear to God...
- You're talking to my sister, Mans?

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.160
- I was gonna tell you.
- Get off me! I will cut you!

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.360
Get off!

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.760
Get off me!
You're taking advantage of my sister?

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.840
- Take it easy.
- Are you tricking my sister?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.720
- Let me go!
- Take it easy, man!

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.000
- Take it easy.
- Calm down.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.200
- What is it, buddy?
- Chill.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400
Enough.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240
Thank you.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.600
What's this? It ain't my shirt.
It's a fat person's shirt.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.520
- You saying I'm fat?
- No, man. I'm not saying that.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.279
I'm just kidding.
But you felt bad for me, right?

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.040
I'm convincing.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.080
- You're a photographer?
- What?

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.800
- You're a photographer, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:36.120
- So, you take pictures of actors and such?
- Not actors. I did once.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.000
- But now I cover news.
- I went to a casting once.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.760
- What casting?
- In Sherif Arafa's office.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.479
- For his last movie.
- Are you an actor?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.520
Yes, I am. I also sang that day.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.399
The audition was for the role of a
singer. I have a beautiful voice.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.640
Here, I'll sing
something you'll like a lot.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:04.920
<i>Islam calls
And we all come to defend it</i>

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:10.279
<i>Whenever called upon
Our bones are your ladder of glory</i>

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.479
<i>Whenever called upon</i>

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.359
<i>Whenever called upon</i>

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.520
You sang this bone song at the casting?

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.160
I sang something for Nancy, but my
vocal chords were affected by the gas.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.000
- Obviously.
- I remember you. I saw you once before.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.279
They called him the Gas Singer
during the revolution.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.800
Don't joke about that.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.840
Do you know Ramy Essam,
Singer of the Revolution?

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.439
- Yeah.
- He's my friend.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.960
People used to ask for me
instead of him. They love me.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080
No, because you made 'em laugh the most.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.479
- I said don't joke, Omar!
- So, you're the Gas Singer?

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.640
- Have you listened to anything of mine?
- Once, the place was empty,

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.120
we thought the revolution was over.
And we said once the Gas Singer leaves,

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.880
everyone will just come back.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.680
Those were the days.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.000
<i>Nothing is more beautiful than mad love</i>

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.800
<i>Nothing is more beautiful than mad love
And it's how I feel with you</i>

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:40.040
<i>You filled my days with passion and love
You put a spell on me</i>

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.520
<i>I'm madly in love with you
My smitten heart's full of hope</i>

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.120
Sorry, I've troubled you, old man.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.360
- Not at all, Hajj.
- Not at all?

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.520
You can barely stand.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.160
Who knows if we'll ever get out of here?

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.360
There's something I have to say,
but I don't know how.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.000
My son is with them now, I know.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.120
I didn't wanna tell you.
I was worried about you.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.480
You've done so much for me.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.320
Whose shirt is this, people?

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.200
Why did you give up acting?

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.960
No one from Sherif's office
could reach me.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.240
- Mr. Moaz?
- Yeah.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.799
Why did you let them chant
"retribution is a bullet" and all that?

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.199
If we don't side with our own,
the Brotherhood won't last.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.520
Don't worry. When we return to power,
everything will go back to normal.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.080
Is that really possible, though?
It seems impossible.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.200
As you see,
we're in the middle of this huge mess.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.959
"Allah keeps firm those
who believe in His word,

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.480
in this life and in the Hereafter.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.960
And Allah casts off wrongdoers." Yes?

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.040
- "And Allah does what He wills."
- True are the words of Allah.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.120
Where are you going, man?
Why are you driving like this?

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.440
Will you stop driving like this?
We're all banged up.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.520
Hey, you! I'm a fellow soldier!

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.960
I'm Private Eweiss!
I swear to God, I'm a fellow soldier!

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.040
Open the door! Get me out of here!

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.600
Did you read the messages?

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.440
I was afraid of telling you,
because you know my situation.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.080
I wasn't gonna keep it from you
any longer.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.720
See, that's why I'm trying the DJ gig.
I'm doing it for her.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.760
The only reason you came with me is
'cause she asked you to watch out for me.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.200
No. Read the next message.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.000
I told her I was going with you today
to ask you for her hand.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.360
I'd rather give her to one of those
traitors than to a lowlife like you.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.240
It's me, Mans. Your friend.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:01.640
My friend? Take him to your side.
He's just like you.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.600
By the way, we'll need your address,
so we can return your pins.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.880
Don't worry. Your dad will be fine.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.600
What's your name?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.400
I'm the one who asked to come here.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.720
He didn't wanna do it. I told him I'd
come alone if he didn't come with me.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.800
He shouldn't have listened to you.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.520
It's not your fault.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.840
Now, tell me, what's your name?

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.600
- Aisha.
- I'll take your number, Eisha,

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.320
- so I can check up on you.
- It's actually pronounced Aisha not Eisha.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.320
I'll call you Eisha.
I'm not uptight like you people.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.480
Where are we going, guys?

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.800
This isn't the route to the Directorate.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.600
Who are you?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.080
Oh, my God. It's Malik.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.880
- Did you think I'd leave you?
- Who the hell is Malik?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.519
- My brother.
- Open the door.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.079
Huzaifa, are you okay?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.319
- I am. How are you?
- I'm okay. Is the Hajj with you?

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.440
- The Hajj...
- He's on a different truck, Malik.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.439
- Try to get us out of here.
- Do something, Malik, quickly.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.440
- Open the door.
- Hurry up!

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.640
Easy, guys.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.720
- Open up.
- Easy, people!

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.440
- Hold on. You'll make us all fugitives!
- Wait, man.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.640
- Yes, Malik!
- Open it!

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.799
Forget it, man.
You'll get us all in trouble.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.520
Forget him. Open the door!

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.480
He'll open the door.
If you wanna leave, leave.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.440
Hurry up before someone comes.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.440
- IDs, please.
- Zein.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.600
- Sherif Abdel...
- Sherif Farghali Elish.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.680
- Mohammed Hashem, please.
- No, Ahmed Hashem.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.760
- It won't open.
- What's wrong?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.320
- It's locked with handcuffs.
- Look for the keys in the cabin.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.960
You might find them there.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.640
Hurry up, Malik.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.520
- Did you find it?
- Find anything?

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.732
- There's nothing here.
- Our demonstrations are close by.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.920
Call any of them.
They'll figure something out.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.040
I lost my phone.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.280
We have a phone here.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.280
- Give me your phone.
- Out of battery.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.880
He's lying. It's not.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.800
Give me the phone
and I'll see if it's dead.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.920
- Hand over the phone!
- I won't!

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.640
Fine! Go use someone else's phone.
Those people in the tent.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.800
- Radwan Abu Bakr.
- Yes.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.800
- Salah Magdy.
- Yes.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.240
The Muslim Brotherhood is but a phase.
As of today, you're ready to move on.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.200
When I get out of
here, I'll go to Syria.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360
- Badr.
- Yes.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.560
Come with me if you want.
Thanks, you're a good soldier.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.000
- Thanks.
- You'll leave the police once we get out.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.480
How can I? It's my military service,
it's not voluntary.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.680
- Or else, it'd be prison.
- Prison or death?

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.440
I'll leave that to God.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.320
We're not trying to scare you.
You're naive.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.040
You don't know that you're helping
the Jews and the Christians.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.080
Here he comes.
You think we'll make it home?

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.160
God willing, dear.
I just hope we find a ride.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.600
There's a bus stop down this road.
Surely, we'll find a bus there.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.160
We just need to get out of here,
even if we have to walk home.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.200
Are we in the Fifth Settlement
or Sixth of October City?

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.360
It doesn't matter where we are.
What matters is getting out of here.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.920
- I'm so sleepy.
- We'll go to the hospital first for Dad.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.240
And then we'll go home.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.400
We're going home.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.520
What's wrong? I can drop you
wherever you want. Where do you live?

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200
On the streets.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.800
It won't come off.
You'd better go with them.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.800
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'll catch up, man.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.520
- You'll die.
- You must get out, with the camera.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.560
- Forget the job and the camera.
- I'm not here because of the job.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.800
The moments we've captured
can change a lot of lives.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.560
You must leave.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.840
- Did you do it?
- No one is picking up.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.280
- They're all at the protests.
- Take us to the protests.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.720
- They'll get us out.
- What? The protest?

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.640
- Don't worry. You're under our protection.
- Are you crazy?

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.920
- They'll kill us.
- Go to the protest, man!

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.400
- No way! No protest!
- Are you out of your minds?

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.000
Don't go, you idiot!

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.680
Get him to crash the back
into a wall or a fence.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.080
- Maybe it'll break the door.
- Don't listen to them. Go on.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.040
If this goes south, it's on you.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.800
- What, are you scared? Are you with them?
- Even if I weren't I wouldn't let 'em die.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.999
- No one will die. We protest in peace.
- We're not killers.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.399
These protests are out of control now.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.320
Let him try crashing
the back into a wall!

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.600
- Let him try.
- Why don't you let him try first?

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.040
Malik, wait. Try crashing the back.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.560
No more waiting.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.600
- Get moving, Malik.
- Why wait?

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.480
- Why?
- You wouldn't understand.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720
I don't care!

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.480
Malik, I'm in charge here.
If you're still a Brother, do it.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.839
It didn't open, Malik!

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.320
- One more time, it'll open.
- Again, Malik.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.800
- It's stuck.
- Push it, guys!

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.600
Let's get the truck moving, people.
Push.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.120
We got to get it moving.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.560
Shake it, guys. Keep going.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.800
Keep going.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.440
Harder, people!

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.120
Once the truck is out, you start moving.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.360
- Where to?
- To our protests.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.960
No way! You're not alone here!

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.520
The truck won't move!

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.880
Get off, man!

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.560
Stop!

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.960
- Calm down, people.
- Stop it!

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.640
Stop it!

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.960
- What's going on?
- What is it?

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.480
- Stop the truck, or we kill him.
- What the hell are you doing, Nagwa?

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.440
- Stop!
- Huzaifa!

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.520
- Get back.
- Don't stop, Malik.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.840
- Don't stop!
- We'll cover for you.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.040
- Come any closer, and we make him bleed.
- Keep going, Malik.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.400
He would die a martyr!

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.400
- Any last words, martyr?
- They'll get killed if they go there.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.240
- We won't stop! That's that!
- If they arrest us, they'll kill us!

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.200
- Enough.
- Take it easy, guys.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.040
Tell your brother to stop the car.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.280
Dad died, Malik.

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:52.320
He died along with the others in the
other truck. Don't listen to them.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.919
There's no God but Allah.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.800
Just let him go.
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.280
Bastards! They ought to be killed!

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.440
It's fine. Just calm down.
We're not killing anyone.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.360
Malik. Stop.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.960
- Stop, Malik, please.
- Mohammed.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.640
We won't let anyone touch 'em.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.680
Leave me alone. Stop, Malik.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.680
What are you looking at, Hajj?

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.520
- It's over.
- I'm looking for my son, Tarik.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.320
He may be with them.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.200
Wear this, soldier.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.800
So they won't know you're a soldier.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.680
- Malik, stop the truck.
- Omar.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.160
No one will come near them. I swear it.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.000
- Malik, stop the truck.
- Stop.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.320
Please, Malik, stop the truck.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.880
- Stop the truck, Malik.
- Listen to us, Malik.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.880
For God's sake, stop.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.760
Please, Malik. Please, stop the truck.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.720
These people will die.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.720
Malik, stop the car.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.840
Malik!

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.800
Stop the car.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:59.119
Traitors! Traitors! Traitors! Traitors!

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.560
- Is this demonstration on our side?
- Stop the truck, Malik.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
No. It's on their side.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.640
They're on our side.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.120
- Stop the truck, Malik.
- Stop.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.840
Stop the truck, Malik.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.040
- Malik!
- Stop the car, Malik!

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.920
- Don't stop, Malik.
- Keep going.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.799
No, Nagwa. They'll kill us.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.280
- This demonstration is on our side.
- Islam will prevail!

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.000
- Keep driving, Malik.
- Shut up, man!

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.680
- Shut up!
- They'll kill us all.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.560
If we go to any protest right now,
we'll get killed. Listen to him.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.920
He's right. Listen to him.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.520
- Traitors! Traitors! Traitors!
- Enough.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.320
I swear, they won't care who's who.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.520
It's a Muslim Brotherhood demonstration.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.040
- We're with you.
- We're on your side.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.200
I swear, we're on your side.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.440
God bless the army! God bless the army!

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.280
- Malik!
- We're with you, guys!

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.840
Islam will prevail!

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.240
Guys! We're with you! He's my brother!
Malik!

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.920
Malik! Let him go, please!
We're on your side!

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.840
We're on your side!

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.040
Malik! Malik!

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.119
Islam will prevail! Islam will prevail!

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.960
Sing it!

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.519
God bless the army! God bless the army!

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.280
Traitors! Traitors!

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.080
Traitors! Traitors! Traitors!

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.240
Hossam!

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.880
Zein!

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Zein!

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.520
Mans!

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.160
Someone close the door!

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.680
