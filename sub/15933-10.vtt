WEBVTT

00:21.731 --> 00:24.401
Citizens of Colombia,

00:24.484 --> 00:29.864
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

00:33.451 --> 00:36.246
PABLO ESCOBAR PRESIDENT

00:41.084 --> 00:42.210
Thank you.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.130
How are you, Mr. President?

00:51.970 --> 00:53.430
Thank you.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.351
Thank you.

01:03.273 --> 01:04.273
Much appreciated.

01:08.486 --> 01:09.904
Thank you.

01:10.947 --> 01:12.407
Please come in, Mr. President.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.601
- All yours.
- Thank you.

01:45.356 --> 01:49.360
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:49.444 --> 01:52.864
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
- What's this?

01:53.573 --> 01:57.160
<i>Happy birthday, dear Pablo</i>

01:57.243 --> 02:00.663
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

02:02.248 --> 02:04.042
<i>Bravo, Pablito!</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:07.545
<i>I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.</i>

02:07.629 --> 02:10.381
<i>Don't forget to blow out the candles,
Dad.</i>

02:10.465 --> 02:14.886
<i>Happy birthday, Daddy!</i>

02:15.804 --> 02:17.722
<i>Pablo, we miss you so much.</i>

02:17.806 --> 02:19.891
<i>We wish we could be there with you.</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.643
<i>I know, my love.</i>

02:22.435 --> 02:25.688
<i>Soon this will all be behind us.</i>

02:26.898 --> 02:28.358
<i>I promise.</i>

07:29.742 --> 07:31.119
Good morning, boss.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.830
I made some eggs.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.667
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.335
Thanks.

07:42.839 --> 07:45.007
I got everything we need, boss.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.344
You went to a different store, correct?

07:48.427 --> 07:50.930
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

07:53.850 --> 07:57.937
So, the shopkeeper's mom, she's a healer.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.774
I paid her a visit.

08:03.234 --> 08:06.779
I told you not to talk to anybody.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.198
Yeah, boss, but...

08:10.950 --> 08:16.247
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

08:17.707 --> 08:18.875
Look...

08:20.126 --> 08:23.462
I asked her for something to protect you.

08:24.797 --> 08:27.049
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

08:27.592 --> 08:30.678
- the Virgin--
- ...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

08:35.183 --> 08:39.437
You know my mother and I built a church?

08:40.771 --> 08:41.898
Yes, sir.

08:43.191 --> 08:45.067
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

08:45.151 --> 08:46.736
That's where I grew up, boss.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.448
Happy birthday, sir.

08:51.449 --> 08:53.242
Thank you, Limón.

08:54.911 --> 08:56.287
Pardon me.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.265
From south Medellín.
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.856
If he does, we'll be listening.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.461
This stays between us, understood?

09:47.338 --> 09:52.051
We will set up a temporary base
in Casablanca.

09:52.134 --> 09:56.264
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

09:56.347 --> 09:58.224
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.689
Lieutenant Martinez?

10:06.649 --> 10:10.528
How long since we heard anything
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?

10:11.028 --> 10:12.530
A month and a half, sir.

10:13.197 --> 10:16.492
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

10:17.785 --> 10:20.288
Yes. Waiting.

10:21.330 --> 10:25.418
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.839
Excuse me.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.221
Six.

10:47.398 --> 10:52.111
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.656
It's your turn.

10:56.741 --> 11:00.328
I think if coke was legal, boss,

11:00.411 --> 11:05.166
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.011
Yes, sir.

11:18.054 --> 11:21.724
We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellín.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.226
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

11:24.310 --> 11:28.105
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

11:28.898 --> 11:31.233
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

11:31.317 --> 11:33.861
If your men are able to find Escobar...

11:35.863 --> 11:37.448
I don't care about the consequences.

11:40.368 --> 11:41.368
I want him dead.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.914
Do you have a problem with that?

11:47.208 --> 11:52.963
With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

11:53.047 --> 11:55.299
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.135
Keep me informed.

12:01.639 --> 12:02.973
Gentlemen.

12:38.843 --> 12:40.010
Mrs. Escobar?

12:40.886 --> 12:42.930
The attorney general called this morning.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.724
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.895
So we have to leave by the weekend.

12:49.979 --> 12:53.649
No. No, you can't do this to us.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.027
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.077
Ma'am?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.872
May I give you some advice?

13:11.625 --> 13:15.463
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.089
Forget about him.

13:38.486 --> 13:41.947
<i>The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?</i>

13:43.824 --> 13:47.286
Probably not a good idea right now,
my love.

13:48.621 --> 13:51.540
<i>So... do you feel a year older or what?</i>

13:53.542 --> 13:55.836
More like four or five.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.506
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.883
The days feel longer.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.346
For me too.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.892
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellín.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.144
That place is too dangerous, my love.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.693
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.154
Pablo...

14:24.114 --> 14:27.826
<i>I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.</i>

14:29.787 --> 14:32.831
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.208
You can survive prison.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.422
We both know that won't happen.

14:40.506 --> 14:42.341
Stop!

14:43.551 --> 14:45.970
<i>- Listen to me, Pablo...</i>
- They're talking.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.973
<i>- You will always be Pablo Escobar.</i>
- Boss.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.309
<i>You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.</i>

14:52.393 --> 14:53.936
My man.

14:54.812 --> 14:57.439
<i>My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.</i>

14:57.523 --> 14:59.358
<i>The people love you and follow you.</i>

15:00.025 --> 15:02.403
<i>Tata, Limón wants me off.</i>

15:02.486 --> 15:05.656
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

15:07.408 --> 15:09.743
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.456
<i>They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:16.458
<i>They gave him the Nobel Prize.</i>

15:16.542 --> 15:21.463
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.465
<i>Of the same country that imprisoned him.</i>

15:23.549 --> 15:25.551
<i>I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.</i>

15:25.634 --> 15:27.303
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

15:27.386 --> 15:30.180
<i>All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.</i>

15:30.264 --> 15:32.141
<i>It's very important.</i>

15:32.224 --> 15:35.269
<i>It's our only way out really.</i>

15:36.020 --> 15:37.938
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.816
Colonel! This is Lieutenant Martinez.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.819
<i>Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.</i>

15:43.902 --> 15:45.279
I'll think about it.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.489
All right?

15:50.284 --> 15:51.952
<i>I love you very much.</i>

16:24.193 --> 16:25.444
Where are you going?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.321
To Medellín.

16:27.404 --> 16:31.950
What? No, Hermilda. You can't leave.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.828
My son needs me.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.206
How so?

16:37.915 --> 16:39.291
What you want...

16:40.918 --> 16:44.171
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

16:44.838 --> 16:46.038
I don't want them to kill him.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.290
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.927
They won't if he turns himself in.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.888
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.807
No! No, ma'am.

16:54.890 --> 17:01.313
I will not stay quiet
when I see you betraying my son.

17:01.397 --> 17:05.275
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

17:05.943 --> 17:09.113
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.240
We can't even leave the country.

17:12.741 --> 17:17.246
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

17:18.372 --> 17:20.249
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.632
My son...

17:30.008 --> 17:32.219
needs his mother.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.061
Hermilda.

17:50.154 --> 17:53.449
Please be very careful. Please.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.201
Tell the children...

17:59.121 --> 18:00.622
I'll tell them.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.560
We have intel that Escobar
is in this building.

18:22.311 --> 18:26.148
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.777
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

18:29.860 --> 18:33.655
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.910
Now, if he resists...

18:38.619 --> 18:41.747
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

18:42.539 --> 18:44.416
I want you to take his life. Understood?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.251
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.552
Everything all right, boss?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.992
Tata wants me to surrender.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.332
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.626
Nelson Mandela?

20:13.630 --> 20:15.507
Who's that, boss?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.310
Did you buy more rolling papers?

21:08.936 --> 21:10.479
Sorry, no, boss.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.266
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

22:09.621 --> 22:10.956
<i>He's not here.</i>

22:16.336 --> 22:19.756
Boss, come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.803
This is my city, Limón.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.517
These are my people.

22:34.146 --> 22:37.399
Medellín will never betray me.

22:43.113 --> 22:44.156
Colonel.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.700
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.619
Looks like your little machine is broken,
right, Lieutenant?

22:49.703 --> 22:51.747
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.624
Excuse me, Colonel.

22:58.879 --> 23:02.966
Listen up! Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguín.

23:13.852 --> 23:17.189
The son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

23:21.985 --> 23:25.113
- A ghost.
- What's that?

23:25.864 --> 23:29.659
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

23:29.743 --> 23:32.829
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

23:38.043 --> 23:41.713
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.549
Give me the keys!

23:44.633 --> 23:47.302
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

26:17.410 --> 26:20.664
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

26:20.747 --> 26:23.250
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

26:23.333 --> 26:25.502
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.896
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.819
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:57.659 --> 27:01.162
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

27:02.497 --> 27:03.790
Sir.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.002
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

28:05.518 --> 28:07.562
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

28:41.221 --> 28:44.808
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

28:44.891 --> 28:47.102
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

28:49.062 --> 28:51.856
They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

28:51.940 --> 28:54.192
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

28:57.654 --> 29:00.073
You look just like Che Guevara.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.991
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.869
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.005
What? You don't miss me or what?

29:19.801 --> 29:22.303
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.557
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

29:26.224 --> 29:28.101
Thank you, Gustavo.

29:30.770 --> 29:35.150
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

29:35.775 --> 29:39.320
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.989
Never letting anything stop him.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.577
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

29:46.286 --> 29:50.415
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.543
Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.506
Tata wants me to surrender.

30:01.009 --> 30:05.096
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.098
Maybe it's a good idea.

30:09.559 --> 30:13.855
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

30:13.938 --> 30:18.318
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

30:18.401 --> 30:19.777
The legend grows.

30:20.445 --> 30:22.947
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

30:25.408 --> 30:29.078
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.791
Let's cut the bullshit.

30:35.627 --> 30:38.630
We are bandits, Pablo.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.465
Right?

30:47.013 --> 30:48.264
What do you think?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.353
I think...

30:55.271 --> 30:59.984
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

31:04.614 --> 31:06.908
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.379
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

32:40.877 --> 32:43.713
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.507
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

32:50.136 --> 32:52.180
It worked perfectly.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.563
You're a good man, Limón.

33:03.650 --> 33:04.859
Thank you.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.862
Thanks a lot.

33:08.446 --> 33:11.741
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

33:11.824 --> 33:15.536
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.913
I'm hungry.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.459
<i>Tata?</i>

33:25.546 --> 33:26.546
Pablo?

33:26.589 --> 33:29.300
<i>There's the love of my life.</i>

33:30.802 --> 33:34.055
- You sound different.
<i>- I'm good, my love.</i>

33:35.014 --> 33:36.599
I feel good.

33:39.143 --> 33:41.521
And ready to talk to those reporters.

33:43.523 --> 33:45.108
Good, my love.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.276
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

33:51.239 --> 33:52.240
No, Tata.

33:53.366 --> 33:55.368
<i>I'll never surrender.</i>

33:58.913 --> 34:01.207
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

34:02.709 --> 34:04.043
You have to.

34:08.423 --> 34:10.425
I'll never surrender, my love.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.566
I know, Pablo.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.903
But what's your plan?

34:34.407 --> 34:35.575
All right.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.827
I know what we're going to do.

34:40.288 --> 34:44.208
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

34:44.292 --> 34:46.252
<i>That's what we are going to do.</i>

34:51.841 --> 34:54.719
<i>- ...foreign journalists...</i>
- Alvaro, slow down!

34:54.802 --> 34:57.638
<i>...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...</i>

34:57.722 --> 35:00.349
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

35:04.353 --> 35:08.483
<i>We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.</i>

35:10.026 --> 35:13.946
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

35:14.030 --> 35:17.784
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.952
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

35:20.745 --> 35:23.289
<i>- We will succeed.</i>
- Stop!

35:25.208 --> 35:30.254
<i>As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...</i>

35:30.338 --> 35:32.423
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

35:32.507 --> 35:35.760
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

35:36.511 --> 35:37.678
And listen...

35:38.721 --> 35:43.351
I will not rest until that happens.

35:43.434 --> 35:46.813
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

35:49.106 --> 35:52.610
<i>I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.</i>

35:57.240 --> 35:59.325
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

35:59.408 --> 36:00.868
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

36:00.952 --> 36:02.286
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

36:02.370 --> 36:05.039
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.335
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.171
<i>Go ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

36:12.755 --> 36:14.131
Colonel, I found him.

36:14.715 --> 36:16.133
<i>Who? Escobar?</i>

36:17.301 --> 36:18.678
Yes, Colonel.

36:18.761 --> 36:20.346
<i>He's in Los Olivos.</i>

36:22.473 --> 36:24.350
Son, are you sure?

36:24.433 --> 36:26.936
We can't afford the luxury
of making another mistake.

36:28.813 --> 36:30.231
I'm sure. I saw him.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.693
What do you mean you saw him?

36:34.527 --> 36:37.905
<i>Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.</i>

36:39.240 --> 36:40.825
And did he see you?

36:42.243 --> 36:43.619
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

36:45.997 --> 36:47.456
Listen up, Lieutenant.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.042
<i>There's still some men
in the staging area.</i>

36:50.126 --> 36:53.713
<i>I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?</i>

36:54.422 --> 36:55.965
Copy that, Colonel.

36:56.048 --> 36:58.968
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.598
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

37:05.975 --> 37:06.851
Hello, Dad.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.769
How's it going, son?

37:10.479 --> 37:12.398
You wanted to ask me something or what?

37:12.481 --> 37:13.733
Yes, sir.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.235
What wish did you make for your birthday?

37:16.319 --> 37:19.780
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

37:20.573 --> 37:22.909
<i>Tell me! Don't be like that!</i>

37:22.992 --> 37:25.411
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

37:25.494 --> 37:27.914
<i>is that it was a very good wish.</i>

37:27.997 --> 37:28.873
You know,

37:28.956 --> 37:31.417
<i>you deserve the best birthday
in the world.</i>

37:43.596 --> 37:45.056
Thank you, my love.

37:48.976 --> 37:52.188
<i>- Captain, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, Colonel?

37:52.271 --> 37:54.899
<i>How many men are left
in the provisional base?</i>

37:54.982 --> 37:57.777
- Counting me, about 12.
<i>- Listen up.</i>

37:58.945 --> 38:02.782
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
<i>- Shit! Let's go!</i>

38:02.865 --> 38:04.742
Everybody to Los Olivos!

38:05.451 --> 38:07.078
<i>Hello.</i>

38:07.161 --> 38:11.540
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

38:11.624 --> 38:12.624
Good.

38:12.667 --> 38:16.462
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.557
Perez!

38:28.641 --> 38:32.395
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.441
<i>Get your mom on the phone, okay?</i>

38:39.068 --> 38:40.194
Pablo.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.797
<i>- Do you have the questions?</i>
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.741
<i>The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.</i>

38:46.993 --> 38:50.371
<i>"How do you feel after
all of these days on the run?"</i>

38:52.331 --> 38:53.666
Write this down.

38:55.710 --> 38:58.045
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

38:58.129 --> 39:01.048
who I love more than anything
in the world."

39:01.132 --> 39:04.552
- Sergeant, go around.
<i>- "But I feel good.</i>

39:04.635 --> 39:06.178
<i>I feel strong.</i>

39:06.262 --> 39:11.058
<i>And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.</i>

39:12.143 --> 39:15.771
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

39:16.439 --> 39:22.862
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

39:23.904 --> 39:27.658
<i>The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.</i>

39:31.829 --> 39:34.957
The government
is holding my family hostage.

39:36.125 --> 39:39.378
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

39:39.462 --> 39:42.590
<i>that calls itself democratic.</i>

39:43.382 --> 39:46.177
<i>My little kids are innocent children</i>

39:46.260 --> 39:50.723
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

39:56.854 --> 39:59.482
<i>All we want from the government</i>

39:59.565 --> 40:02.485
<i>is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.</i>

40:02.568 --> 40:08.699
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

40:08.783 --> 40:09.950
Without that--"

40:14.413 --> 40:15.498
One moment.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.374
What happened, Pablo?

40:21.337 --> 40:24.298
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

40:25.049 --> 40:26.926
Pablo.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.137
<i>Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.</i>

40:30.763 --> 40:32.181
<i>Pablo, what's going on?</i>

40:34.100 --> 40:35.518
What's wrong, Mom?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.065
Go on. All right.

40:50.116 --> 40:51.325
Go!

40:52.868 --> 40:53.868
Let's go!

40:57.164 --> 41:00.167
Let's go! Come on!

41:00.251 --> 41:01.335
Come on!

41:01.961 --> 41:03.337
Come on! Move!

41:21.605 --> 41:22.857
Move!

41:23.440 --> 41:24.483
Go!

41:25.025 --> 41:26.443
Keep going!

42:01.687 --> 42:04.481
Nobody shoot!

42:29.715 --> 42:31.467
Sergeant Sarmiento!

42:32.092 --> 42:34.345
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

42:34.762 --> 42:36.222
Is he alive?

43:17.221 --> 43:18.847
Long live Colombia.

43:19.682 --> 43:21.392
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

43:21.475 --> 43:23.477
We killed Pablo Escobar!

43:23.560 --> 43:26.397
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

43:26.480 --> 43:29.817
<i>- Long live Colombia!
- Long live Colombia!</i>

43:52.631 --> 43:54.049
Go ahead.

44:00.222 --> 44:02.683
They killed Pablo Escobar!

45:31.230 --> 45:32.773
My son!

46:38.380 --> 46:40.382
<i>I pray to God that other mothers</i>

46:40.466 --> 46:44.553
<i>don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.</i>

46:44.636 --> 46:47.514
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

46:47.598 --> 46:50.642
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

46:50.726 --> 46:52.853
<i>I want the good things he did
to be remembered,</i>

46:52.936 --> 46:55.230
<i>because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.</i>

46:55.314 --> 46:58.484
<i>He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.</i>

46:58.567 --> 47:00.527
<i>No one has paid attention to that.</i>

47:00.611 --> 47:04.740
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

47:04.823 --> 47:08.118
<i>He was the noblest of men.
Not just as a son...</i>

47:37.189 --> 47:40.442
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

47:40.526 --> 47:41.902
Thank you.

47:48.700 --> 47:49.910
Talk to me.

47:52.829 --> 47:55.499
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

47:57.209 --> 47:58.627
He told you that?

48:01.672 --> 48:05.092
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

48:05.175 --> 48:07.678
you were once associates and friends.

48:14.518 --> 48:16.228
You were saying?

48:17.896 --> 48:22.442
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

48:24.486 --> 48:26.071
That you would forgive us.

48:27.531 --> 48:30.075
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

48:32.828 --> 48:35.747
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

48:35.831 --> 48:38.417
In property? In cash?

48:43.213 --> 48:44.464
I can find out.

48:48.093 --> 48:49.636
That's good.

48:50.429 --> 48:52.347
Because I want all of it.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.378
All right, gentlemen.

50:05.003 --> 50:06.630
Gentlemen!

50:06.713 --> 50:12.761
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

50:20.769 --> 50:22.062
<i>The first sale.</i>

50:22.145 --> 50:25.982
The first million. The first billion.

50:26.066 --> 50:30.404
And when your rival no longer exists.

50:45.168 --> 50:48.255
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

50:48.338 --> 50:50.674
but how well one has prepared for them.

50:50.757 --> 50:55.095
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

50:58.598 --> 51:02.978
<i>And we won't be needing kidnappings
and bombs to succeed.</i>

51:03.061 --> 51:06.356
We will do it covertly.

51:06.440 --> 51:09.234
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

51:09.317 --> 51:10.652
we'll no longer be there.

51:10.736 --> 51:12.487
No, sir!

51:12.571 --> 51:14.906
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
