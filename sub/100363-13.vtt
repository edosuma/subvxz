00:06.960 --> 00:08.946
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:08.947 --> 00:11.114
God. Shut up.

00:11.115 --> 00:13.599
What's happening to you

00:13.600 --> 00:16.569
looks just like what happened to my mom.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.581
The episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

00:18.582 --> 00:20.139
They got worse.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.907
When she's alone, everything's normal,

00:21.908 --> 00:23.043
but when you show up...

00:23.044 --> 00:25.699
I still mess her up.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.579
The creatures you call Takers...

00:27.580 --> 00:29.092
do you know what they are?

00:29.093 --> 00:31.200
They are guard dogs.

00:31.210 --> 00:32.839
Their realm is a security measure,

00:32.840 --> 00:35.910
a barrier between your world
and the world of the Dead.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.802
The Dead will ruin Fillory.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.245
We must stop this, whatever the cost.

00:40.246 --> 00:43.230
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

00:43.231 --> 00:44.356
- which is...
- A decent option.

00:44.357 --> 00:46.469
In the center of Fillory
is a clockwork heart

00:46.470 --> 00:47.619
built by dwarves.

00:47.620 --> 00:49.480
If I wound the clock
backward, it would...

00:49.487 --> 00:50.988
it would destroy Fillory.

00:50.989 --> 00:53.574
What about the World
Seed, from Q's page?

00:53.575 --> 00:56.159
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

00:56.160 --> 00:57.286
a new Fillory.

00:57.287 --> 00:59.079
I intended to rescue my people

00:59.080 --> 01:00.581
from this chaotic place,

01:00.582 --> 01:02.916
so I also built an ark.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.793
- How do they feel?
- Like ghost fingers.

01:04.794 --> 01:08.255
They work, but magically
they still feel severed.

01:08.256 --> 01:09.673
The Couple just got
the last thing they need.

01:09.674 --> 01:11.705
They have the Seed,
the Page, and the Panel.

01:11.706 --> 01:12.718
We got to tell the others.

01:12.719 --> 01:14.637
They need to steal that seed now.

01:14.638 --> 01:16.513
Guys, Alice has an exit.

01:16.514 --> 01:17.679
Get to the roof.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.300
Ho, ho, ho, motherfuckers.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.219
Oh, hey, Alice.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.325
Ooh, did I sleep till December?

01:36.326 --> 01:38.469
I couldn't resist giving
out a few more gifts

01:38.470 --> 01:39.569
while I'm here.

01:39.570 --> 01:42.439
Given your quest-heavy lifestyle,

01:42.440 --> 01:43.917
there's no guarantee that any of you

01:43.918 --> 01:45.557
will live to see Christmas.

01:45.558 --> 01:46.878
Sit. Have a cookie.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.089
What is that?

01:53.090 --> 01:55.344
No idea. It's for Eliot.

01:55.345 --> 01:57.739
Is that a Microplane for Josh?

01:57.740 --> 01:59.119
He already has six.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.927
Do you question how you bend light?

02:00.928 --> 02:03.927
Well, I don't question how I pick gifts.

02:03.928 --> 02:06.189
Here, put your finger
right here, please.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.110
Looking for yours?

02:12.111 --> 02:13.647
You already got it.

02:13.648 --> 02:15.895
- Huh?
- Long time back.

02:18.218 --> 02:21.495
I put it in a locked drawer
in Quentin's desk.

02:21.496 --> 02:24.879
What, you... you gave me that?

02:24.880 --> 02:27.419
So what did the page turn out to say?

02:27.420 --> 02:31.069
It was... was a spell. It...

02:31.070 --> 02:33.939
grew a seed into a world,
but why did you put it there?

02:33.940 --> 02:36.039
- What if I'd ignored it or...
- But you didn't.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.787
You needed something,

02:37.788 --> 02:38.959
get back in the game.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.249
You weren't gonna pass on a mystery

02:40.250 --> 02:42.578
you thought your guy was working on.

02:45.660 --> 02:48.019
I'm very sorry for your loss.

02:48.020 --> 02:50.775
It really sucks.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.930
Well, now you know.

02:54.936 --> 02:56.799
That page and wherever
that quest took you,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.069
wasn't his story.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.059
It was yours, Alice.

03:00.060 --> 03:03.299
For what it's worth, I think
he'd be really proud of you...

03:03.300 --> 03:04.830
the way you keep on fighting.

03:05.946 --> 03:10.043
I told you... I told you you were good.

03:12.746 --> 03:15.117
I still don't know if that's true.

03:15.118 --> 03:18.049
Hey. This is how it works.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.553
You do your best.

03:19.554 --> 03:23.056
You fuck up, get hurt. People die.

03:23.057 --> 03:26.351
Except for the odd Microplane,

03:26.352 --> 03:28.859
jack shit gets wrapped up in a bow.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.139
Oh...

03:30.140 --> 03:32.959
you know, you're a real
ray of sunshine, Santa.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.649
Ho, ho, ho.

03:36.420 --> 03:37.571
Oh, shit.

03:37.572 --> 03:39.365
- Creatures stirring.
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.957
- What the pumpkin spice fuck?
- Huh.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.279
Oh, my God.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.255
These are sold out literally everywhere.

03:55.256 --> 03:56.259
Thanks, Santa.

03:56.260 --> 03:58.640
Oh, this is wrapped really tight.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.299
Santa got me a bracelet?

04:00.300 --> 04:02.259
It's the exact right grade

04:02.260 --> 04:03.659
- for the truffle-shaving technique...
- This is so thoughtful.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.679
José Andrés showed me
the last time we hung out.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.719
- What is this even for?
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.539
A-fucking-plus. This is
handy and sort of chic.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.439
Oh, it's a surprise! I love surprises.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.566
Is this baby shit?

04:14.567 --> 04:17.277
Yep. It's baby shit.

04:17.278 --> 04:19.988
Fillory needs you. Now!

04:22.033 --> 04:24.284
Achtung, miscreants.

04:24.285 --> 04:27.559
There is no uncrucial portion of this.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.399
As per several super-chatty bunnies

04:29.400 --> 04:30.519
from our super buddy Rafe,

04:30.520 --> 04:32.359
the Dark King is planning
on opening a portal

04:32.360 --> 04:34.336
to the Underworld tonight.

04:34.337 --> 04:36.899
Now, here's the plan.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.039
Part the first...

04:39.040 --> 04:42.469
Rapture Fillory. Margo
and I will go to Fillory.

04:42.470 --> 04:44.089
Activate Umber's Ark.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.568
And then we go to the Clockwork Heart.

04:45.570 --> 04:48.359
How will you know they're all raptured?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.379
Everyone?

04:49.380 --> 04:52.679
Wait, um, I know a thingy.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.349
It's in the castle,

04:54.350 --> 04:56.316
so if we just go there and grab it...

04:56.317 --> 04:58.610
Great. Moving on.
We will turn back the clock,

04:58.611 --> 05:01.895
and then we get ready to
say good-bye to Fillory.

05:01.896 --> 05:04.185
W-with you still on it?

05:04.186 --> 05:06.699
Obviously not. We need to GTFO.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.699
You need a traveler.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.979
23 can't aim.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.410
His pervo buddy Hyman's
not speaking to us,

05:12.416 --> 05:14.418
Gavin's still in the hospital.

05:14.419 --> 05:17.479
Oh, Peach, or whatever your name is.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.299
Unfortunately, when I travel,
it's kind of through time.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.539
And puts you in the crosshairs

05:22.540 --> 05:24.219
of a time psycho, so, no.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.429
Meanwhile, on Earth,

05:26.430 --> 05:28.299
Team WorldSeed...

05:28.300 --> 05:32.657
Alice, Fen, Zelda,
you will retrieve the Seed

05:32.658 --> 05:36.106
from its special container
and... bloom it.

05:36.107 --> 05:39.519
- Where?
- It's in my vagina.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.779
Uh, great.

05:40.780 --> 05:43.199
I mean, circumstances are wacky.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.239
- Won't that make it tough to...
- Neitherlands.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.249
More stable there.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.540
Wouldn't Fillory be better, since...

05:48.548 --> 05:49.599
Not at all.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.479
In fact, counterproductive,
given imploding.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.294
Okay, Peach, I get you're nervous,

05:54.296 --> 05:56.001
but this isn't our first donkey show,

05:56.002 --> 06:00.699
which leads me to something
actually crucial to the plan.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.779
No presh, but...

06:02.780 --> 06:06.009
New Fillory better have a wellspring.

06:08.626 --> 06:11.005
Or we permanently lose magic.

06:11.006 --> 06:14.127
The spell says we can
make the Seed anything,

06:14.128 --> 06:15.520
so it should be doable.

06:15.521 --> 06:17.689
Great. Now...

06:17.690 --> 06:19.507
questions, anyone?

06:19.508 --> 06:21.776
No? And break.

06:22.987 --> 06:24.738
- Was I funny?
- No.

06:24.739 --> 06:26.159
My water just broke.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
- Whoa!
- Oh!

06:27.686 --> 06:29.339
- Ooh, okay.
- Go time!

06:29.340 --> 06:30.820
Okay. Just calm down.

06:30.828 --> 06:32.455
- Are you okay?
- Go, let's go.

06:37.880 --> 06:42.370
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

06:44.675 --> 06:47.039
Ready as we can be. ETA?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.460
Julia should be here in under five.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.707
Help! I need help!

06:50.708 --> 06:52.658
What the hell happened to him?

06:52.659 --> 06:54.840
The etheric realm.

06:54.850 --> 06:56.097
A lot of it.

06:56.098 --> 06:57.646
This is our Fogg? You're sure?

06:57.647 --> 06:58.879
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.119
When we sent Psycho Fogg to the realm,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.800
it spit ours back out.

07:01.806 --> 07:04.692
He called me. He couldn't really talk.

07:04.693 --> 07:06.557
Okay, Henry?

07:06.558 --> 07:09.017
Are you in there?

07:09.018 --> 07:10.449
Hey. We're here!

07:10.450 --> 07:12.449
Push fluids, cast Adler's Sedation.

07:12.450 --> 07:13.459
Henry, be with you soon.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.235
With me. Showtime.

07:15.236 --> 07:16.498
No!

07:16.499 --> 07:18.729
Hard pass, as the kids say.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.519
Nyet! Indian yes.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.359
Oh, hell, no.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.640
Anyway, I'm not speaking to you.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.540
Just wait. Do you not understand?

07:25.550 --> 07:26.716
Do you not understand?

07:26.717 --> 07:31.304
You're asking me to travel
as a world explodes?

07:31.305 --> 07:33.765
Can you promise me

07:33.766 --> 07:36.768
no debris will hit me on my head?

07:36.769 --> 07:38.812
- Well, no, but...
- Things on my head hurt!

07:38.813 --> 07:41.022
Life is pain. Ovary up.

07:41.023 --> 07:42.029
I am not a hero.

07:42.030 --> 07:44.997
I am a man tethered to a machine

07:44.998 --> 07:46.820
for poop and humiliation,

07:46.821 --> 07:49.185
and I abhor it.

07:49.186 --> 07:50.323
I said good day.

07:50.324 --> 07:52.297
- I have an idea.
- Oh.

07:52.298 --> 07:54.703
Hi. How was your nap?

07:54.704 --> 07:56.579
Refreshing. You need him to travel?

07:56.580 --> 07:58.349
Yeah.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.834
What?

08:00.906 --> 08:02.169
- He would never.
- Yes, he would.

08:02.170 --> 08:03.212
- No way.
- Absolutely.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.799
Hey.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.259
- Hyman?
- Can't squawk.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.950
Getting blistered.

08:07.956 --> 08:09.165
Listen.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.715
I have a man in my head.

08:12.763 --> 08:14.459
He's looking for a body.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.739
And you have one that...

08:17.740 --> 08:18.914
You don't even really want.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.062
Jesus. No way he goes for this.

08:21.063 --> 08:24.055
You're an idiot, Charlton.

08:24.056 --> 08:27.095
He wants to take this?

08:27.096 --> 08:30.699
And I would... what?

08:30.700 --> 08:32.578
Stay in the Astral forever?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.116
Well, you could, or you could...

08:34.118 --> 08:36.597
Emphatically yes!

08:36.597 --> 08:39.914
- Oh, my God! On one condition.
- Okay.

08:39.914 --> 08:42.485
Your head pal

08:42.486 --> 08:45.587
has to do weird things with my body.

08:45.588 --> 08:49.459
S... sex things.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.379
- Okay.
- What's his name?

08:51.380 --> 08:52.969
Charlton.

08:52.970 --> 08:56.339
No act too depraved, Charlton.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.880
I'll be watching...

08:59.894 --> 09:02.687
whether you like it or not.

09:02.688 --> 09:04.265
What have we done?

09:04.266 --> 09:06.279
I'm prepped to sever
the energetic umbilical

09:06.280 --> 09:08.540
once baby's here, but, um...

09:08.550 --> 09:11.779
- well, I've never done it.
- What?

09:11.780 --> 09:13.819
It's a unicorn baby. It's your kid.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.185
It is what it is.

09:15.186 --> 09:16.284
Anyway, listen.

09:16.285 --> 09:18.847
You want drugs, girl? Say it now.

09:21.316 --> 09:24.539
Unicorn baby time. Let's do this.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.089
It's okay. It's okay.

09:28.090 --> 09:30.674
Eliot, Hyman, Charlton, wake up.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.472
Did it work?

09:44.890 --> 09:47.269
Oh, gods.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.229
I'm tall.

09:49.230 --> 09:52.015
Great. Let's test that traveling out.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.297
This is the best episode ever.

10:03.066 --> 10:05.625
Just relax, okay? Breathe.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.421
Why can't I do this?

10:10.422 --> 10:12.859
- Just give it a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.037
We have a world to destroy/save.

10:14.038 --> 10:16.019
- He just got in that body!
- He can't travel!

10:16.020 --> 10:17.585
- I want to help.
- We'll be okay.

10:17.586 --> 10:19.175
- Will we?
- Yes.

10:19.176 --> 10:20.640
I know a shortcut to the portal tree.

10:20.641 --> 10:21.917
We just got to run.

10:21.918 --> 10:23.429
What, shortcut?

10:23.430 --> 10:24.819
Yeah, you never mentioned that before...

10:24.820 --> 10:26.896
I wanted one shortcut just for me.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.217
Let's go.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.055
Thanks for trying, Charlton.

10:30.056 --> 10:31.443
Ándale.

10:33.770 --> 10:36.197
- Hey...
- Eliot.

10:36.198 --> 10:37.928
Come back safe.

10:40.123 --> 10:41.203
Of course.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.477
Dean Fogg?

10:58.721 --> 11:00.799
Way easier to get in than out.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.599
Hmm. Like so many things in life.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.267
This will keep the Seed safe...

11:04.268 --> 11:06.102
for a short time.

11:06.103 --> 11:08.547
We should begin.

11:10.691 --> 11:12.809
Fogg? Why aren't you in bed?

11:12.810 --> 11:14.799
- Henry, are you all right?
- Fogg?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.155
Henry, what are you doing?

11:18.157 --> 11:20.868
Wait here. I'll get him.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.659
You're my last messenger.
Listen carefully.

11:37.660 --> 11:40.500
Tell High King Margo to...

11:40.506 --> 11:42.175
Hurry!

11:42.176 --> 11:44.449
We're goddamn trying! Thanks!

11:44.450 --> 11:46.709
Got it.

11:46.710 --> 11:52.139
- What's this now?
- A royal census scroll.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.184
Oh.

11:53.185 --> 11:54.409
You see?

11:54.410 --> 11:56.079
Two people just died,

11:56.080 --> 11:58.738
and a fairy was born.

11:58.739 --> 12:01.115
Hatched. So we can see when
they're being raptured.

12:01.116 --> 12:02.719
I love it when a good lay

12:02.720 --> 12:04.469
turns out to have a
working brain, don't you?

12:04.470 --> 12:06.121
Yeah. That Josh is a keeper.

12:06.122 --> 12:10.139
Well, there's a button under here.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.378
It begins!

12:13.550 --> 12:14.922
Hey, I think it's working.

12:18.466 --> 12:21.119
Great, but go faster.

12:28.143 --> 12:29.715
I think it's picking up speed

12:29.716 --> 12:31.337
now that all the squirrels are in.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.467
Hey, El, you think we should...

12:36.418 --> 12:39.028
Raptured? He's not Fillorian.

12:40.686 --> 12:43.109
You okay?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.819
I'm not great at that spell,
even with enhancement.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.899
Don't worry. He's dead.
They're all dead. So it's time.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.500
Follow me close.

12:52.528 --> 12:54.585
Figured you'd come to Fillory...

12:54.586 --> 12:59.299
what, with your translator
spying so diligently.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.577
I thought I'd cut to the chase.

13:01.578 --> 13:03.749
And just bring you here
to the Taker Realm

13:03.750 --> 13:05.629
to ask for your help.

13:05.630 --> 13:07.755
Well...

13:07.756 --> 13:09.059
not ask.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.187
The final door.

13:14.982 --> 13:17.059
It's a girl.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.940
She's beautiful.

13:18.950 --> 13:21.419
Not that it's about that.
I mean, she's healthy.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.449
Okay, let's celebrate on
the B-side of surgery.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.700
You are a warrior.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.839
Is she up?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.079
Is she okay? Is Lipson?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.249
Yeah. She's as prepped as she can be.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.599
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.999
- You doing okay?
- Okay, good.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.399
Goggles?

13:37.400 --> 13:41.039
All right. Okay.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.509
Number 14 scalpel, Selenite.

13:45.706 --> 13:48.307
Okay, start with the baby.

13:49.920 --> 13:54.060
Shouldn't hurt either of you.
Just, you know, don't move.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.300
Dean Fogg? What are you doing?

13:59.180 --> 14:00.979
Wait.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.060
Wait, Dean. Please.

14:10.620 --> 14:14.469
Where the hell is the Seed?

14:14.470 --> 14:15.666
Julia?

14:15.667 --> 14:17.238
- Julia?
- Is she okay?

14:17.239 --> 14:18.519
- Lipson!
- Jules!

14:18.520 --> 14:20.169
Julia.

14:20.170 --> 14:23.019
I know you're worried.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.539
But it's all going to be okay...

14:24.540 --> 14:26.844
because of you.

14:26.845 --> 14:29.135
There is a danger, once this door opens,

14:29.136 --> 14:30.724
more dead will come through.

14:30.725 --> 14:33.142
This is insane.

14:33.143 --> 14:35.771
Not if you seal it fast.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.899
You didn't just bring
me here to help you.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.026
You knew that I would try to stop you.

14:42.027 --> 14:43.599
And deep down...

14:43.600 --> 14:44.987
I know you want that, too.

14:47.114 --> 14:48.389
If I wanted you to stop me,

14:48.390 --> 14:50.439
I wouldn't have cast on
that door 20 minutes ago.

14:54.776 --> 14:55.902
Right on time.

14:55.903 --> 14:57.540
- Seb. Seb, don't do this.
- Rupert!

14:58.920 --> 15:00.220
Rupert.

15:01.213 --> 15:02.505
Lance.

15:02.506 --> 15:04.607
Eliot, seal the door.

15:04.608 --> 15:08.344
My love, my stars, my heart.

15:08.345 --> 15:09.470
We did it.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.180
Touch me.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.179
I can't.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.727
You can't kill me. I can't die.

15:18.558 --> 15:21.065
You mean it? We can...

15:21.066 --> 15:24.068
We can... forever.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.117
No!

15:31.118 --> 15:33.119
No.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.989
Hello, big brother.

15:35.990 --> 15:39.625
Save me, Rupert. I love you so.

15:39.626 --> 15:41.210
You're still so predictable.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.796
Your soft heart, your stubbornness,

15:43.797 --> 15:45.367
your stupidity.

15:45.368 --> 15:46.633
What did you do to him?

15:46.634 --> 15:48.259
Who? Lance?

15:48.260 --> 15:49.919
Never even met him.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.557
He must have moved on centuries ago.

16:02.357 --> 16:03.524
Spent some time in the Library

16:03.525 --> 16:06.419
with my batty old writer
friend, Cassandra,

16:06.420 --> 16:08.889
reading about the lengths
you were going to

16:08.890 --> 16:09.939
to save him.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.284
You didn't work nearly
so hard to save me...

16:12.285 --> 16:14.659
from Plover.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.871
Did you?

16:16.872 --> 16:19.525
Of course I did...

16:19.526 --> 16:20.833
until I couldn't.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.753
I had to save everyone from you.

16:23.754 --> 16:28.919
- You chose the dark path.
- Says the Dark King.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.637
Anyways, reading about
you made me realize,

16:32.638 --> 16:35.762
after everything you did to stop me,

16:35.763 --> 16:38.392
you were going to give
me everything I needed

16:38.393 --> 16:40.770
to have Fillory...

16:40.771 --> 16:42.389
forever.

16:45.180 --> 16:47.199
All I needed to do

16:47.200 --> 16:51.399
was make a few judicious
political promises.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.567
Leave it open. More will follow.

17:00.568 --> 17:02.699
And of, course, I had to
make peace with the fact

17:02.700 --> 17:05.039
that we would need to kill everyone.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.297
But what good are the living, really?

17:07.298 --> 17:10.409
The world's better off with me.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.556
You're the sad little addict

17:16.557 --> 17:18.432
that tagged along with
Julia and Quentin.

17:18.433 --> 17:22.520
How in the blazes are you
still alive after all this time?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.904
No matter.

17:31.888 --> 17:33.279
So much to do!

17:33.280 --> 17:34.900
Let's go.

17:36.508 --> 17:39.565
Onward to the land of
the living, friends.

17:39.566 --> 17:41.643
All the lands of the living.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.834
Kady should be back by now.

17:47.835 --> 17:49.099
This doesn't feel right.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.519
- We should leave.
- We can't.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.589
I'm certain we won't be able
to cast precisely enough

17:52.590 --> 17:53.779
if we...

17:53.780 --> 17:55.012
What was that?

17:56.140 --> 17:58.139
Kady? Is that you?

17:59.796 --> 18:01.351
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

18:01.360 --> 18:03.728
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

18:03.729 --> 18:05.965
♪ Heigh-ho the derry-o ♪

18:05.966 --> 18:07.649
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

18:07.650 --> 18:09.555
I know that voice.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.055
It's The Beast.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.055
No, I killed him myself!

18:13.056 --> 18:14.479
Then the Dead have risen.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.659
Follow me.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.283
Hello, friends.

18:17.284 --> 18:19.161
We've come to bring death everywhere.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.499
This room is warded, but not for long.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.533
That way... a portal will
take you to Brakebills.

18:26.534 --> 18:29.334
Go. Alice... when you
recover the Seed...

18:29.335 --> 18:31.759
I-I only have one good hand.
We need you. I can't...

18:31.760 --> 18:33.995
There's something Master Magicians know.

18:33.996 --> 18:37.234
You can never fully control
external circumstances.

18:37.235 --> 18:39.348
They may even be actively hostile.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.892
But you can control the ones inside you.

18:41.893 --> 18:44.509
And one hand...

18:44.510 --> 18:46.239
is plenty.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.975
I've always known you'll get there.

18:48.976 --> 18:50.559
But today?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.140
Try. Okay?

18:53.153 --> 18:54.737
Just try.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.117
Go now. Hurry.

19:00.488 --> 19:02.315
- Come with us.
- I can't.

19:02.316 --> 19:04.372
I'm going to have to
initiate Permafrost.

19:04.373 --> 19:06.359
It'll stop the Dead using the fountains

19:06.360 --> 19:07.715
to get to other worlds.

19:07.716 --> 19:10.419
Once I initiate, every portal
will close within minutes.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.129
We can't just leave you here.

19:12.130 --> 19:16.109
For a librarian, death isn't the end.

19:16.110 --> 19:19.320
It is merely a transfer
to another branch.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.597
Go.

19:23.767 --> 19:27.349
Wait, Zelda.

19:27.350 --> 19:30.356
Thank you... for everything.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.799
Hello, noble Librarian.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.996
Did you just...

19:45.997 --> 19:47.239
Mm.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.879
We have to run...

19:48.880 --> 19:51.710
before the sodding fountain
to Fillory's locked.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.716
I'll find another way.

19:56.576 --> 19:58.369
Not that you'll be here to see it.

20:06.226 --> 20:08.079
So lovely.

20:13.058 --> 20:15.499
Eliot, stop! Eliot, wait!

20:17.320 --> 20:19.279
You took your shot.
You destroyed the entire world.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.939
Will you just leave it...

20:20.940 --> 20:24.159
Please... please, let me just
at least heal your hand.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.779
Shh.

20:26.780 --> 20:31.199
I survived war, losing Lance,

20:31.200 --> 20:33.109
my family torn apart by a monster

20:33.110 --> 20:34.339
who said he would take
care of my brother,

20:34.340 --> 20:35.499
and I thought one thing...

20:35.500 --> 20:39.285
I just want to use magic
for one thing I want...

20:39.286 --> 20:42.219
- You knew better.
- I had to try!

20:42.220 --> 20:44.181
You couldn't understand that.

20:45.643 --> 20:48.977
But I do understand. I always did.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.273
Eliot, what was the plan?

20:53.274 --> 20:55.260
Before I, uh...

20:57.726 --> 20:58.892
My friends are here.

20:58.893 --> 21:01.269
They're rapturing everyone so
we can destroy this planet

21:01.270 --> 21:02.657
that we love, by the way.

21:02.658 --> 21:04.951
But we have to to destroy you.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.759
You left us no choice, Seb.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.789
That could still work.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.167
I could cut off the door
to the Underworld,

21:11.168 --> 21:13.115
stop Martin bringing
anymore Dead through.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.253
Don't try to cast. You'll hurt yourself.

21:18.254 --> 21:20.748
Great, not like the zombies are coming.

21:20.749 --> 21:22.919
Go. Find your friends.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.379
I can hold off the Dead.
It's not like they can kill me.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.539
No, they can rip you to shreds,

21:27.540 --> 21:28.558
and then we'd kill you anyway.

21:28.559 --> 21:30.429
Eliot, go.

21:30.430 --> 21:32.760
Do you not get that I
don't want you to die?

21:32.770 --> 21:35.692
You're not evil. You're just...

21:35.693 --> 21:38.527
You're just some deluded asshole...

21:38.528 --> 21:41.049
That I care about.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.140
Who says I'll die?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.579
- Your daughter is healthy.
- Good.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.879
And Julia?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.381
Has not regained consciousness.

22:00.438 --> 22:01.757
When do you expect?

22:01.758 --> 22:04.029
Her organs are shutting down.

22:04.030 --> 22:05.554
We are trying everything, but...

22:08.060 --> 22:10.389
- Can I see her?
- Yeah.

22:10.390 --> 22:13.520
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

22:19.322 --> 22:21.139
Hey. I got you some food.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.600
You should really eat...

22:22.604 --> 22:23.822
I know I told you you shouldn't do it.

22:23.823 --> 22:26.699
But... but I will protect
you, okay, somehow.

22:26.700 --> 22:28.229
I know a way to get to Jane Chatwin.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.579
She'll help us, and you
can go back to before...

22:29.580 --> 22:30.619
- Professor...
- You can go back

22:30.620 --> 22:32.706
and stop Julie from dying, please.

22:32.707 --> 22:34.869
We can't.

22:34.870 --> 22:37.160
Why the fuck not?

22:37.170 --> 22:40.421
Because we already did.

22:48.430 --> 22:51.433
What... what... what do
you mean "we already did"?

22:51.434 --> 22:54.599
This is the do-over.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.220
It got so much worse, so fast before...

22:59.218 --> 23:01.651
So you took me to my grandmother, Jane.

23:01.652 --> 23:02.979
Time loop...

23:02.980 --> 23:04.769
only way to undo time without getting

23:04.770 --> 23:07.559
that grouchy time traveler's
knickers in a knot.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.409
Clean start.

23:11.332 --> 23:13.069
Big magic, though.

23:13.070 --> 23:14.739
Unfortunately, she told me

23:14.740 --> 23:17.739
that I only had enough
plasma to do it once.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.662
Okay, but what... what did you change?

23:19.663 --> 23:22.713
Only Josh had escaped Fillory.

23:22.714 --> 23:24.955
In the West, they had no way of knowing

23:24.956 --> 23:29.011
if the Ark even worked,
so they got trapped waiting.

23:29.012 --> 23:32.056
I pushed Josh to find a way.

23:32.057 --> 23:33.917
And the Seed,

23:33.918 --> 23:36.259
they tried it here and failed.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.125
And Zelda took them to the Neitherlands.

23:40.361 --> 23:41.983
They never came back.

23:41.984 --> 23:43.985
Why didn't you tell them
not to do that either?

23:43.986 --> 23:45.689
I tried!

23:45.690 --> 23:47.359
They wouldn't listen!

23:47.360 --> 23:49.106
And Jane said not to do too much,

23:49.107 --> 23:51.359
or that might do more damage.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.075
It's a tricky business.

23:55.076 --> 23:57.414
But she was adamant that I try.

23:57.415 --> 24:00.084
Professor, we have to tell her.

24:00.085 --> 24:02.169
She is trapped here

24:02.170 --> 24:05.559
and... insane to think
about it... pregnant

24:05.560 --> 24:06.716
with my mother.

24:09.620 --> 24:11.070
Yes.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.390
Tell me what, my dears?

24:16.700 --> 24:18.379
We are going to destroy Fillory.

24:18.380 --> 24:21.950
With you on it.

24:21.958 --> 24:24.109
It is the only way to stop your brother.

24:29.410 --> 24:32.399
Best we can do is to
try to stop our legacy

24:32.400 --> 24:33.952
from hurting anybody else.

24:33.953 --> 24:36.912
You're doing the right
thing, both of you.

24:39.550 --> 24:40.750
But I won't be gone.

24:41.874 --> 24:44.920
I'll still be here in the Clock Barrens.

24:44.921 --> 24:47.549
Without Fillory,

24:47.550 --> 24:50.301
it'll be a little bit harder to find me.

24:53.110 --> 24:54.560
So Julia...

24:54.570 --> 24:57.599
Look, I had no idea that Fogg
would suddenly attack her.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.339
Fogg didn't attack last time?

24:59.340 --> 25:01.263
No, I-I have no idea why he would.

25:01.264 --> 25:03.339
Wait. Wait!

25:03.340 --> 25:05.679
Fogg remembers time loops.

25:05.680 --> 25:09.379
What if he remembered
something and... and is...

25:09.380 --> 25:11.072
is trying to change this one?

25:11.073 --> 25:14.855
The etheric realm shook
loose most of his screws.

25:14.856 --> 25:17.315
He's useless, as you can see.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.288
But there's still Fogg under there.

25:19.289 --> 25:21.623
You know, it's like hardwood under shag.

25:21.624 --> 25:23.084
Well, how do we get rid of the shag?

25:23.085 --> 25:25.589
I'm not doing this, okay?

25:25.590 --> 25:27.422
This is banned in 14 countries.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.406
Okay.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.930
The cat will hold all his crazy,

25:36.933 --> 25:39.017
but only while he's touching it.

25:39.018 --> 25:40.925
What happens to the cat?

25:40.926 --> 25:43.827
It goes, well...

25:43.828 --> 25:45.142
crazy.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.774
Don't tell PETA.

25:46.775 --> 25:48.939
All right. We ready?

26:01.456 --> 26:04.689
Hey. Thank you, Professor

26:04.690 --> 26:07.219
The cat looks normal.

26:07.220 --> 26:10.089
Trust me. This cat's having a shit day.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.176
But I managed to get everyone

26:11.178 --> 26:12.758
out of the Neitherlands in time.

26:12.759 --> 26:15.919
Plum may not know, but, yes,

26:15.920 --> 26:17.840
they are going to be attacked.

26:17.850 --> 26:19.979
Well, it seems you did
manage in your way.

26:19.980 --> 26:23.930
Good. Tell Kady the Seed is in the lab.

26:23.937 --> 26:25.312
Why did you attack Julia?

26:25.313 --> 26:28.389
Because she and your child would die

26:28.390 --> 26:30.815
if Eleanor had performed
the goddamn surgery.

26:30.816 --> 26:32.419
Yeah, well, she's dying now, so...

26:32.420 --> 26:35.989
If you had succeeded in
delicately separating the cord,

26:35.990 --> 26:38.519
it would be rendered useless.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.739
Quick, rough cut...

26:39.740 --> 26:42.704
counterintuitive, yes, I know.

26:42.705 --> 26:45.433
The cord goes into a state of shock.

26:45.434 --> 26:47.699
Allowing it a chance for implantation.

26:47.700 --> 26:48.940
- Yes.
- Shit.

26:48.950 --> 26:50.859
This will let Julia recover.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.798
Last time you realized far too late.

26:52.799 --> 26:54.379
The only catch is

26:54.380 --> 26:55.995
you need to attach it to someone else,

26:55.996 --> 26:58.544
someone who can handle
the physic input from, well...

26:58.545 --> 27:01.850
a clearly very powerful traveler baby.

27:06.840 --> 27:10.150
It looks still alive... for now.

27:11.572 --> 27:13.989
The Circumstances control panel is gone,

27:13.990 --> 27:15.697
and the Moon is not
gonna make this easy.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.139
So choice is, do it here
where the casting's jacked

27:19.140 --> 27:20.320
or let it die?

27:20.326 --> 27:23.075
If we do it here, who
knows what it'll make?

27:23.076 --> 27:25.542
I think the people of Fillory
deserve a place to go,

27:25.543 --> 27:27.859
even if it doesn't end up as Fillory.

27:27.860 --> 27:29.299
Okay. I'll get started.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.363
What about Eliot, Margo, and Josh?

27:31.364 --> 27:32.799
We still haven't heard from them.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.819
Do you think they've been able to...

27:33.820 --> 27:37.634
Let's just hope they're having
more luck than we are.

27:37.635 --> 27:40.721
The slide to the Clock Dwarf
is at the end of the hall.

27:40.722 --> 27:42.899
It takes ten minutes just to slide down

27:42.900 --> 27:43.974
and even longer to get back up.

27:43.975 --> 27:46.439
Sorry, I was really stoned
the last time I did this.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.811
Time to discuss your shortcut, Margo.

27:47.812 --> 27:49.439
Yeah. There isn't one.

27:51.149 --> 27:53.439
What do you want me to say?

27:53.440 --> 27:55.010
Somebody had to egg up and do this,

27:55.016 --> 27:56.321
and I am Margo the Destroyer.

27:56.322 --> 27:57.809
I didn't name you that just so you...

27:57.810 --> 27:58.849
Get destroyed while destroying?

27:58.850 --> 28:00.599
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.110
I'm not wild about it either.

28:02.113 --> 28:05.579
But... this thing's got
to get done, so...

28:05.580 --> 28:07.189
- We'll all go.
- Yes, we'll all go.

28:07.190 --> 28:08.200
Stop.

28:08.208 --> 28:11.237
You know, if I learned one
thing from Quentin...

28:11.238 --> 28:13.199
one...

28:13.200 --> 28:17.174
it's that sometimes you
sacrifice for those you love.

28:17.175 --> 28:19.885
I'm doing this so you two can live,

28:19.886 --> 28:21.846
so don't you dare follow me.

28:25.940 --> 28:29.019
In case the Clock Dwarf
wasn't raptured, a bribe.

28:29.020 --> 28:30.619
A ham sandwich?

28:30.620 --> 28:34.259
A ham sandwich. That is
culatello, capicola, speck,

28:34.260 --> 28:35.499
a bit of Jamón Ibérico,

28:35.500 --> 28:37.144
shaved black truffle
from the Microplane.

28:37.145 --> 28:39.899
That is the best goddamn
ham sandwich ever made.

28:56.286 --> 28:58.289
This way I'll know you guys are safe.

28:58.290 --> 29:00.218
I'll wait until you get
through the tree to do it.

29:00.219 --> 29:01.760
Bambi, wait!

29:03.780 --> 29:05.047
Come on.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.212
Penny?

29:17.986 --> 29:20.692
Hey. You're... you're, um...

29:20.693 --> 29:22.353
You're up. How are you...

29:22.354 --> 29:23.490
how are you feeling?

29:23.491 --> 29:27.145
Oh, decent, considering.

29:27.146 --> 29:28.199
Where's baby?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.619
Oh, Lipson took her to get changed.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.829
How come I can't hear her?

29:32.830 --> 29:33.900
Up here?

29:35.160 --> 29:36.419
You're fixed.

29:36.420 --> 29:37.840
How?

29:37.850 --> 29:41.919
Here she is, baby Eleanor.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.629
I don't remember naming her Eleanor.

29:43.630 --> 29:45.345
Yeah, it's 'cause we didn't.

29:45.346 --> 29:47.722
People name their kid after
their doctor all the time.

29:47.723 --> 29:49.766
- It's a thing that happens.
- Sure.

29:49.767 --> 29:52.219
All right, Eleanor.

30:01.418 --> 30:05.307
Oh, I think she, uh...
she may have just pooped.

30:05.308 --> 30:07.689
Oh, hey, uh, I got this.

30:07.690 --> 30:10.229
I've been practicing.

30:10.230 --> 30:12.020
I'm ready.

30:15.473 --> 30:17.669
Hope...

30:17.670 --> 30:19.657
I like that.

30:19.658 --> 30:23.279
I never said that. I thought it and...

30:23.280 --> 30:26.090
Yes, I can...

30:26.093 --> 30:28.889
live with Quentin as her middle name.

30:28.890 --> 30:31.975
Good. Again, what the hell?

30:31.976 --> 30:33.762
Side effect.

30:33.763 --> 30:36.135
Uh, we had to attach the cord to Penny,

30:36.136 --> 30:38.345
and when we did, you got better.

30:38.346 --> 30:40.689
Wait, so you got your...
You're psychic again?

30:40.690 --> 30:42.359
Only when I'm holding her.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.322
What else can you do while holding her?

30:56.501 --> 30:58.453
Ah!

30:58.454 --> 31:00.232
Hello?

31:01.420 --> 31:04.290
Hello?

31:04.293 --> 31:06.134
Anybody there?

31:07.538 --> 31:10.138
Of course not.

31:10.139 --> 31:14.133
"Do not turn backward,
or Fillory will be destroyed.

31:14.134 --> 31:15.706
Management."

31:17.377 --> 31:19.731
Guess he got raptured.

31:19.732 --> 31:22.385
Okay, boys.

31:22.386 --> 31:24.528
Show me you were able
to make it out of here.

31:24.529 --> 31:25.775
Hey, Margo.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.813
In case you can read lips,

31:27.814 --> 31:30.727
I just want to say,
you're the love of my life.

31:30.728 --> 31:32.399
I know. Duh.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.164
Anyway, um, we're here.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.819
Okay, we are officially at zero,

31:40.820 --> 31:42.691
which means...

31:44.845 --> 31:46.967
Oh, she looks very pregnant.

31:46.968 --> 31:48.739
Actually, the male seahorse

31:48.740 --> 31:51.680
carries the young and gives birth.

31:51.681 --> 31:53.557
- Margo would have dug that.
- Yeah.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.689
Are we really doing this?

32:00.690 --> 32:04.537
I don't think I can do this.

32:04.538 --> 32:05.819
We'll do this together.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.499
Okay.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.860
Here we go, Bambi.

32:12.810 --> 32:14.990
Bye.

33:26.350 --> 33:28.725
She's not coming back.

33:28.726 --> 33:30.515
You don't know that.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.370
What is this?

33:45.378 --> 33:47.709
They ended Fillory.

33:47.710 --> 33:52.050
Well, that hardly seems sporting!

34:01.850 --> 34:03.020
Aah!

34:14.530 --> 34:17.310
Come with me if you want to live!

34:18.280 --> 34:19.409
Penny?

34:19.411 --> 34:21.203
Yeah, sorry! Josh wanted me to say it!

34:21.204 --> 34:22.915
It seemed real important
to him! Come on!

34:42.310 --> 34:43.998
I've never cast magic before.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.679
You're not casting now, Fen.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.106
Just... I'm just happy to be included.

34:47.107 --> 34:49.279
I feel all tingly.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.536
Is that what casting magic feels like?

34:51.538 --> 34:54.235
- Too late to swap her out for Kady?
- Don't be mean.

34:54.235 --> 34:56.692
Look, I haven't spent time in Fillory.

34:56.693 --> 34:58.439
Unless you want your new world

34:58.440 --> 35:00.076
looking like the Lower East Side?

35:00.077 --> 35:01.347
- Then...
- Mm.

35:01.348 --> 35:02.495
I could try.

35:02.496 --> 35:04.887
Lipson said it's too soon.

35:04.888 --> 35:07.418
- Permanent damage.
- I just want to help.

35:08.288 --> 35:10.703
The Moon is cranky.

35:10.704 --> 35:14.591
Zelda's gone, and Alice
is down a hand, so...

35:15.689 --> 35:19.879
Um, I know something that might help.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.931
You cracked the code
on Moon circumstances?

35:21.932 --> 35:23.960
- Nope.
- Then what the hell is your plan?

35:25.796 --> 35:28.549
My plan is I'm going to accept

35:28.550 --> 35:30.733
exactly everything I am right now.

35:30.734 --> 35:34.899
Instagram that nonsense
later, girl. I mean...

35:34.900 --> 35:37.299
Every single good and shitty part

35:37.300 --> 35:40.069
and especially the shit.

35:40.070 --> 35:42.119
I suggest we all do it.

35:42.930 --> 35:44.259
We have to acknowledge it

35:44.260 --> 35:46.749
in order to adjust for
it in your casting.

35:48.209 --> 35:50.549
Internal circumstances...

35:50.550 --> 35:52.838
it's the one thing we can control.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.570
One hand is plenty.

36:01.806 --> 36:03.589
I'm ready.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.643
Are you ready?

36:06.838 --> 36:10.102
Hold Fillory in your minds, okay?

36:10.103 --> 36:13.007
Too late to pee?

36:13.008 --> 36:14.787
You know what? It's... it's fine.

36:14.788 --> 36:16.939
It's fine. Sorry.

36:43.548 --> 36:46.009
It's ready, Fen.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.140
- Do I just...
- Talk to it.

36:57.144 --> 36:58.653
Your memories.

36:58.654 --> 37:02.359
Um, okay. Okay.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.199
Uh, I remember the... the Silver Banks

37:06.200 --> 37:07.537
and Chatwin's Torrent

37:07.538 --> 37:11.459
and, uh... the Chankly Bore?

37:11.460 --> 37:13.669
Huh, that was weird.

37:13.670 --> 37:17.959
Uh, there's Broken Bay

37:17.960 --> 37:20.577
and...

37:20.578 --> 37:23.384
- Nothing's happening.
- What the fuck, Fen?

37:23.385 --> 37:25.181
You can't just describe it.

37:25.182 --> 37:27.599
You need to give it your memories.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.770
Oh. Okay.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.376
My Fillory...

37:38.080 --> 37:40.570
I remember...

37:40.571 --> 37:43.587
the first time...

37:43.588 --> 37:46.145
I saw a Pegasus.

37:46.146 --> 37:47.870
I was ten.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.580
Only in Fillory.

37:51.582 --> 37:56.503
I remember the first time...

37:56.504 --> 37:58.947
I saw my dad use magic

37:58.948 --> 38:00.548
to make a knife.

38:00.549 --> 38:04.427
And then he wouldn't show
me 'cause I'm a girl.

38:04.428 --> 38:05.965
I remember

38:05.966 --> 38:08.224
my dad gave me away to a stranger.

38:08.225 --> 38:10.349
And that's where I realized

38:10.350 --> 38:13.999
Fillory kind of sucks sometimes.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.607
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking about my Fillory.

38:16.608 --> 38:20.229
That place could be,
uh, backwards as shit.

38:20.230 --> 38:25.219
And I'm thinking I don't
want to replicate that.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.243
We kind of need a wellspring, so...

38:27.244 --> 38:29.787
Right.

38:34.124 --> 38:37.767
Can't I just...

38:37.768 --> 38:39.838
have the best of Fillory?

38:39.839 --> 38:42.967
The best of us, of Earth.

38:44.385 --> 38:48.179
Plus the best of those cool
movies Todd and I watched.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.994
That's the home I want.

38:52.772 --> 38:55.520
That's what we deserve.

38:58.482 --> 39:00.316
It's happening. It's happening!

39:00.317 --> 39:01.975
Keep going! Keep going!

39:23.053 --> 39:24.884
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

39:36.186 --> 39:37.979
Well, how's it feel?

39:37.980 --> 39:40.389
Like I'm holding a goddamn crazy cat

39:40.390 --> 39:43.809
and the fur is ruining my custom suits.

39:43.810 --> 39:47.652
No wonder all those Bond
villains were always so pissy.

39:47.653 --> 39:48.779
Bright side...

39:48.780 --> 39:50.284
you can actually complain
while you're holding it.

39:50.285 --> 39:52.535
Ah, what a joy.

39:52.536 --> 39:54.412
And magic hasn't vanished.

39:54.413 --> 39:56.119
There's that.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.708
The Moon's more wonked
than ever, of course.

39:58.709 --> 40:00.599
Why should anything be easy?

40:00.600 --> 40:03.160
Maybe we should take a cue
from the Hedge Witches.

40:03.170 --> 40:05.259
Safehouses are starting to keep

40:05.260 --> 40:07.360
a moon-brained lunatic on retainer.

40:07.368 --> 40:09.469
So can we count on circumstances holding

40:09.470 --> 40:10.819
through tonight or... ?

40:10.820 --> 40:12.138
Yeah, I'd move fast, though.

40:12.139 --> 40:15.799
That we can do. Right, boss?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.319
Speaking of adjustments,

40:17.320 --> 40:20.000
how's the newest member
of our faculty holding up?

40:20.008 --> 40:21.147
His hands are healed.

40:21.148 --> 40:22.659
He just has to get used to the fact

40:22.660 --> 40:23.948
that half of his friends are gone.

40:23.950 --> 40:26.719
Charlton, in Hymanesque form.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.299
Here you are in your happy place, but...

40:30.300 --> 40:31.780
you don't seem happy.

40:33.646 --> 40:37.257
I thought being here and teaching

40:37.258 --> 40:40.659
would help, but...

40:40.660 --> 40:41.727
it hasn't.

40:50.810 --> 40:52.804
I...

40:52.805 --> 40:55.625
I miss them.

40:55.626 --> 40:58.383
I feel lost and alone without them...

40:58.384 --> 41:01.919
Margo, all of them.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.319
I even miss Fillory.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.967
Do you think, um...

41:07.920 --> 41:10.280
There's no way Seb survived, huh?

41:11.460 --> 41:13.210
Probably not.

41:13.218 --> 41:15.105
Fillory's gone.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.355
But maybe it's better now.

41:17.356 --> 41:21.995
Maybe now he's somewhere
with someone who loves him.

41:23.794 --> 41:26.115
You're not alone, you know?

41:26.116 --> 41:27.651
Eliot.

41:32.870 --> 41:34.739
Oh, gods.

41:34.740 --> 41:37.557
I am still not used to
how strong alcohol is.

41:37.558 --> 41:40.005
Keep drinking. It'll come.

41:42.380 --> 41:44.180
So I have a surprise for you.

41:45.160 --> 41:48.990
I have had a lot of terrible
surprises of late, Charlton.

41:48.998 --> 41:53.377
I've been getting help from Pete...

41:53.378 --> 41:55.658
the Hedge Witch who deals
in magical objects?

41:55.659 --> 41:58.536
Good Lord. Why?

41:58.537 --> 42:01.485
He helped me figure this out.

42:01.486 --> 42:03.405
Santa left it for you.

42:12.342 --> 42:15.037
Charlton.

42:15.038 --> 42:18.014
You look like you.

42:18.015 --> 42:20.465
I also feel like me.

42:20.466 --> 42:24.837
If you touch me but also inside...

42:27.070 --> 42:28.358
It's nice.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.739
- Well, this is weird.
- Good weird?

42:43.740 --> 42:46.251
- So...
- I have an awkward question.

42:46.252 --> 42:47.959
I often ask myself what you'd say,

42:47.960 --> 42:48.973
and the answer's, "Of course not.

42:48.975 --> 42:50.881
Don't be stupid, Charlton.
Eliot's isn't the kind of... "

42:50.882 --> 42:51.882
Charlton.

42:51.883 --> 42:53.842
Ask.

42:55.890 --> 42:57.974
I wonder whether you could
ever be romantically inclined

42:57.976 --> 42:59.875
with some someone like me?

42:59.876 --> 43:02.339
A thousand-year-old Fillorian

43:02.340 --> 43:04.139
in a pervert ghost's body

43:04.140 --> 43:05.812
wearing a transfiguration amulet?

43:05.813 --> 43:07.152
A man who knows you well,

43:07.153 --> 43:09.441
is emotionally available,
and plans to stick around.

43:18.050 --> 43:21.077
Well, shit, Charlton.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.739
Are we going somewhere?

43:24.740 --> 43:27.875
Upstairs to explore this further.

43:27.876 --> 43:29.545
Fuck.

44:07.499 --> 44:11.086
And what of the efforts to
find our missing students?

44:14.980 --> 44:17.419
- Eliot send those?
- Hey.

44:17.420 --> 44:19.619
Where should we start?

44:19.620 --> 44:23.460
I guess at the top.

44:25.350 --> 44:27.699
I'm sorry there's always another quest.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.438
I know you wanted to just, uh...

44:29.439 --> 44:30.929
Make a home.

44:30.930 --> 44:32.690
Mm. Yeah.

44:32.691 --> 44:33.999
Yeah.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.279
And this is a batshit way
to do it, but it is a way.

44:38.280 --> 44:41.399
Plus, someone's got
to find those idiots.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.480
Shit's never what we
think it's gonna be.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.499
Very occasionally it's better.

44:48.370 --> 44:50.160
Right, HQ?

44:50.170 --> 44:51.649
Right? Yeah.

44:51.650 --> 44:53.940
- HQ?
- Yeah.

44:53.950 --> 44:56.130
Here, just hold my hand.

44:58.217 --> 45:00.218
Where do you think they are?

45:00.219 --> 45:02.939
Maybe they got sucked
into the World Seed

45:02.940 --> 45:05.179
because it needed matter
to turn into a new world.

45:05.180 --> 45:08.187
Maybe it didn't work,
and they got vaporized.

45:08.189 --> 45:10.675
And yet...

45:10.676 --> 45:12.522
we still have magic.

45:14.650 --> 45:18.653
Somewhere a wellspring exists.

45:18.654 --> 45:20.696
Yeah.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.080
Look what I found.

45:36.088 --> 45:37.797
Turns out this place has knife trees.

45:37.798 --> 45:39.139
I mean, if Josh could find

45:39.140 --> 45:41.679
naturally occurring pizza
ovens, then why not?

45:41.680 --> 45:43.050
Hey, guys.

45:43.053 --> 45:45.329
Found a Margherita here,

45:45.330 --> 45:47.391
if anyone is hungry.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.419
This definitely isn't Fillory.

45:50.420 --> 45:53.099
Yeah, but it's not not Fillory.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.148
Kind of smells the same, right?

45:55.149 --> 45:58.479
The opium made it. That's a plus.

45:58.480 --> 46:02.087
I passed a field of bacon... crispy.

46:02.088 --> 46:05.477
- Is that a Fillory thing?
- Mm. More of a me thing.

46:05.478 --> 46:08.177
Well, the air is breathable,

46:08.178 --> 46:09.655
food galore,

46:09.656 --> 46:12.369
no predators in the vicinity.

46:12.370 --> 46:13.860
Is it time?

46:14.876 --> 46:16.085
No?

46:16.086 --> 46:17.109
If we let them out,

46:17.110 --> 46:18.879
we have to tell them we're utterly lost.

46:18.880 --> 46:21.499
No idea where we are
and not a bunny in sight

46:21.500 --> 46:23.384
to get a message to our friends.

46:23.385 --> 46:25.245
And they'll be homesick and scared

46:25.246 --> 46:27.357
and cranky and hungry.

46:27.358 --> 46:31.249
We'll have to build
infrastructure from scratch.

46:31.250 --> 46:34.339
So...

46:34.340 --> 46:36.397
Who wants to do the honors?

46:36.398 --> 46:39.233
You carried the whole
world in your cooch.

46:39.234 --> 46:40.732
You earned it.

46:42.726 --> 46:44.685
Thanks for saying that.

46:44.686 --> 46:47.825
But New Fillory needs a leader.

46:47.826 --> 46:49.329
And...

46:49.330 --> 46:51.949
as its literal birth mother...

46:51.950 --> 46:55.499
I feel I get to say...

46:55.500 --> 46:58.044
I hereby dub thee

46:58.045 --> 47:00.919
High King Margo, the Creator.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.180
Whoo!

47:03.880 --> 47:07.537
Fine. Make a meal out of it.

47:07.538 --> 47:10.222
You guys know our lives are
about to get even weirder

47:10.223 --> 47:12.726
in some insane way we
can't possibly predict?

47:12.727 --> 47:14.250
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

47:14.270 --> 47:16.145
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

47:16.146 --> 47:18.805
I find that somehow...

47:18.806 --> 47:20.399
perversely comforting.

47:20.400 --> 47:21.800
So do I.

47:23.306 --> 47:26.864
That's how I know it's our story.
