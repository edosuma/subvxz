00:31.239 --> 00:33.283
-Hey, Mr. Mustafa.
-Hey, buddy.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.826
Yo, Mo.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.037
What's up, Nick?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.121
Pssht.

00:38.204 --> 00:42.917
You almost done? We're going to Funplex.
There's a <i>Street Fighter </i>tournament.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.629
-Everyone will be there.
-I'm done in 30 minutes. Wait for me.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.507
Ten dollar entry, though.
Can't spot you today.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.718
Got you.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.719
Pssht.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.431
-See you there. Bye, Mr. Mustafa.
-Hey, Nick.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.308
Thank you.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.521
Peace be upon you.

01:04.773 --> 01:09.611
Hamoodi, <i>habibi</i>,
Yasser can't come in. I need you up front.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.655
Can I have some money
to go to Funplex later?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.658
Those games
are a waste of time and money.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.912
I want you to focus on school work.
May God be pleased with you.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.290
But it's a <i>Street Fighter</i> tournament.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.878
Have a great day.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.006
Have a good day.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.978
-Hamoodi.
-I swear, it's not what it seems.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.981
-I promise it's not what it seems.
-What are you doing?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.358
Give it to me.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.363
-Go play with your friends.
-No, I can stay and work.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.698
No.
Go play with your friends. Go.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.743
-Are you sure?
-Go play with your friends.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.415
I promise I'll stay here--

02:04.499 --> 02:07.085
Enough,
go play with your friends. Go.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.995
<i>-Habibi</i>, did you pray <i>Fajr</i>?
-No.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.499
-Still feeling sick?
-I don't have a fever.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.418
Wait.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.964
Come on, sit up.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.887
Olive oil heals everything.

03:01.639 --> 03:06.811
God, heal my son, Mohammed.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.023
<i>-Habibi…</i>
-Mmm.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.775
Remember,
when you are in trouble,

03:12.859 --> 03:15.653
say "<i>bismillah"</i> and use the olive oil.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.614
And trust in God.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.573
Okay?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.116
God willing.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.373
Pray before daybreak. God bless you.

03:31.961 --> 03:36.549
Hey, uh, I have a package
that was delivered to your house.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.261
I know you don't wanna see me right now,
if you could leave it outside,

03:40.345 --> 03:41.888
and I'll get it later.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.681
I'm not trying to pull a fast one.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.517
I just really need those shirts.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.523
I miss you.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.789
-What's all this?
-Our new business.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.292
We're selling Mom's olive oil.
I'm the head of sales and marketing.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.503
Uh, we haven't decided about that yet.

04:13.586 --> 04:18.091
Everybody says my olive oil is the best.
Well, now they can buy it.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.594
They'll buy it by us going
door-to-door, block-to-block,

04:21.678 --> 04:24.097
word of mouth, basically.
That's just phase one.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.058
-You don't even drive.
-That's where you come in, Hamoodi.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.187
-Head of transportation.
-We'll call it 1947.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.149
-The year before the <i>Nakba</i>.
-I know, but this is a tequila bottle.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.861
It's okay, Mama. I washed it really good
and took it from <i>haram </i>to <i>halal.</i>

04:43.616 --> 04:47.412
Our entire asylum case just imploded,
and you start a business?

04:47.495 --> 04:51.332
For 22 years, we've been telling
ourselves, "Everything will be fine."

04:51.416 --> 04:54.502
"It's gonna be okay."
Well, it's never gonna happen.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.880
I got fired from the mobile shop.
I'm selling fake watches out of my trunk.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.133
I had to take a job at a strip club,

05:00.216 --> 05:03.219
but don't worry, because
apparently, I'm not "Dreams material."

05:03.303 --> 05:06.222
I'm sick and tired of working
under the table to provide for us,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.808
help you out,
get you cat food whenever you want.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.561
Hey! Why are you raising your voice on us?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.439
What do you want us to do, huh?
Sit and cry?

05:14.522 --> 05:18.901
Do you think me and your dad
sat out there feeling sorry for ourselves

05:18.985 --> 05:21.237
because Saddam took everything we had?

05:21.321 --> 05:27.368
You think your grandmother cried and died
because the Zionists seized her land?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.370
Our land? We carry on.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.999
That's what we do,
us Palestinians, we carry on.

05:33.082 --> 05:37.670
And this oil is not only a business,
it is who we are.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.469
Sorry, Mama.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.637
-It's okay, Mama.
-I am sorry.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.891
I was out of line. I'm sorry.
I should never talk like that to you.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.100
It's okay, <i>habibi.</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:55.146
-May God be pleased with you.
-God bless you, Mama.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.357
Sameer, I'm so sorry.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.360
-Are you with us?
-Tell you what.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.613
I'll look after the trees,
and you make the oil.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.866
If we press the olives at the farm,

06:06.949 --> 06:09.077
we cut time
between harvest and extraction.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.704
-What do you think?
-I'll see what I can do.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.082
No. You'll figure it out.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.418
God willing.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.051
I can't believe
he worked at a strip club.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.054
I didn't know he got fired
from the mobile shop.

06:28.137 --> 06:32.016
-Do you know what they do in strip clubs?
-Don't tell me, Sameer.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.734
They struck me again.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.363
Whoever got them
knew what they were doing.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.241
They didn't leave a footprint,
tire track or nothing.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.119
Twenty-one trees, about 50,000 dollars.
That's a big-ass heist.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.497
It ain't even about the money.
They screwed my whole system up.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.333
With the machinery,
I have to reset the whole son of a bitch.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.961
So? We have trackers on them.
Let me go get them back.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.297
Son, this could be the cartel
for all I know. Goddamn…

07:03.381 --> 07:06.092
The cartel won't mess around
with olive trees.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.178
Too busy making billions
off cocaine and avocados.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.099
-You're probably right about that.
-Tell you what, I get them back.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.435
You let my mom press her oil on the farm.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.270
What?

07:17.353 --> 07:19.689
Come on, you said it was the best you had.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.150
Imagine what she could do
from harvest to extraction.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.609
She'll take it to another level.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.487
A good old boy and a Mohammed
making olive oil here in Texas?

07:26.571 --> 07:29.824
-Can't pay for publicity like that.
-You ain't been here that long.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.034
-What if I get them back?
-That's a big "if."

07:32.118 --> 07:35.788
I'm a big guy, and I'll go get you
some damn avocados too. How about that?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.876
I'd rather have the fucking cocaine.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.301
So you want to tow
the trees back using my truck?

07:48.384 --> 07:50.887
No, I'll juggle them
back to Houston. Yeah.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.722
What the hell is your plan?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.390
Gonna walk up to them and say,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.852
-"Can I have my trees back, please?"
-Look, I don't have a plan.

07:57.935 --> 07:58.811
Oh.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.814
All I know is I spent
all these years doing stuff for my family.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.108
Now I have an opportunity
to build with them.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.695
Something I can be proud of.
Please, let me drive the truck.

08:07.778 --> 08:08.696
Hell no.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.200
-I'm gonna drive you.
-That's fire, fire.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.119
Can't have you being an idiot
out here chasing trees.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.039
-You need backup and a nigga that thinks.
-Yeah.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.250
-Come on. Let's get it.
-Come on. Let's go.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.549
-Here, at Shipley's Donuts. Come on!
-Relax.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.094
I am, okay? Never tell someone
to relax in a stressful situation.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.179
It never works.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.557
-This is it right here.
-Shipley's.

08:36.641 --> 08:40.394
-These thieves got phenomenal taste.
-Come on, man. Let's just stay on task.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.854
-I'm on task.
-Let's go.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.899
You see anything?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.527
Yeah, I see kolaches and bear claws.
You want one?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.738
Nobody has time for kolaches
and bear claws on a recon mission.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.032
All right. Check over there.
I'll check here.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.242
-Mo.
-Yeah?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.036
-This looks suspicious.
-Know what's suspicious? Your arm.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.080
-Relax.
-Put it down. Come on.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.458
-This is it. It's blinking. It's unlocked!
-Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.627
What the hell are you doing? Hey! Relax!

09:05.753 --> 09:08.089
We gotta make sure nobody's in the truck.

09:10.132 --> 09:10.967
You're good.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.427
Is it? It's good. All right. Okay.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.179
-All right, <i>bismillah</i>.
-What?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.722
"In the name of God we proceed."

09:16.806 --> 09:19.433
That's the hell
you should be teaching me, not <i>batizek</i>.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.810
-I'll work on it.
-All right.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.811
<i>Bismillah.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:27.692
-Yes! I found it!
-The hell you mean, "Ifound it"?

09:27.775 --> 09:30.152
-We found it. We found it.
-All right!

09:30.236 --> 09:32.196
-We found it.
-Come on, let's go.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.323
-Checking it.
-Be quick.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.366
Oh, man.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.744
-Oh, man. This one's all messed up.
-How?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.038
When they pulled it out,
they damaged the roots.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.416
We don't have time
for you to become a botanist.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.043
I gotta make sure they're okay,
or it's a waste of time.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.211
We gotta move.

09:48.129 --> 09:52.133
-All right. The rest of these seem okay.
-Cool. I'll get the truck.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.093
Idiot.
You left the door open?

09:54.176 --> 09:57.054
No, come. Come on,
come on, come on, get in here.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.155
This is a terrible situation, though.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.366
This nigga got me out here
with sticks by my cheeks.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.203
You think I'm laying here
on 1,000 thread-count Egyptian cotton?

10:21.787 --> 10:24.373
Let's calm down and think this through.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.918
When they stop, we'll just sneak out.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.589
-Unless they unload first, then--
-No, no, no.

10:31.672 --> 10:36.093
If they start unloading the trees first,
we play dumb. I'll speak in Igbo.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.680
-You start screaming in Arabic.
-That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.809
When has screaming in Arabic
ever calmed anybody down?

10:43.893 --> 10:47.647
That's what we do when they open it up?
<i>Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar!</i>

10:47.730 --> 10:50.232
You're right. All right?
Uh, we'll just, uh…

10:52.443 --> 10:53.903
We'll just start crying.

10:56.405 --> 11:00.326
Why are you looking at me like that?
Just gotta commit to the cry.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.410
I'm not doing that.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.217
It is not as messy as I imagined.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.177
May I?

11:18.803 --> 11:19.762
Please.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.229
-I'm sorry about you and Mohammed.
-It's okay, it's not your fault.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.772
Of course it's not my fault.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.400
He's a grown man, but you, Maria,

11:32.483 --> 11:34.068
you made him happy.

11:34.985 --> 11:39.156
-And what else a mother can want?
-For him to marry a Muslim?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.784
Yes, that would be great.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.746
Someone younger,
green eyes, long hair till the waist.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.998
Imagine how my grandkids would look like.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543
But he loves you.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.212
And I have to respect that.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.508
-It wasn't about that anyway.
-Oh, really? What was it?

12:03.848 --> 12:07.935
I want a partner not a caretaker,
if that makes any sense.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.941
All these years,
Hamoodi thinks he's taking care of us.

12:14.024 --> 12:18.070
He helps, yes, but I worked. Sameer works.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.905
Even Mustafa left us money.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.451
But in his mind,
this is how he loves his father.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.080
He will learn by time. He will learn.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.218
Thank you.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.472
-Thank you very much.
-Twenty dollars.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.849
But for you, I'll do ten.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.852
JK. It's a present.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.314
Use it only with bread and <i>Zaatar</i>,
no tortillas.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.524
I'll take the money
from 'Hammed. Enjoy it.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.998
Ah, I knew I should've got
some kolaches and bear claws.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.001
You got any water?

13:15.669 --> 13:16.587
Just olive oil.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.052
What's up with you?
Still having withdrawals?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.679
What's the worst thing you've done?

13:25.763 --> 13:29.058
Uh, hell, I don't know.
May be smash Rico's windshield out.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.852
From Hastings.
And make him think AJ did it.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.853
What about you?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.731
I've never told anybody this.

13:38.275 --> 13:41.904
When I was ten, my dad caught me taking
a 20 from the register from his store.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.907
-That's the worst thing you've ever done?
-Yeah.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.661
-You made it seem like it was a big thing.
-It is a big thing.

13:48.744 --> 13:52.373
-I can think of 10 things worse than that.
-Like what?

13:52.456 --> 13:55.960
Picking me up with a car full of drugs.
Lying to your girl.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.419
Getting hooked on lean.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.755
My dad had a heart attack
right after that.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.881
And that was it.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.050
That's how I left it.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.511
Letting him down.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.431
I can still see his face.
The way he looked at me, you know.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.308
Mo, and I feel you.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.852
You were a kid.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
Kids mess up.
That's what the hell they do.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.024
-You think he never did anything wrong?
-You don't understand. He was--

14:19.108 --> 14:21.610
He was human just like the rest of us.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.904
Trying to do
the absolute best he could for you.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.074
Quit beating yourself up about it.
You good, goof.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.289
The hell?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.207
Nigga, we in Mexico?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.671
Oh, shit.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.550
-How are you gonna get back?
-I deported myself.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.343
Listen.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.429
Come on, check, check.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.558
Nick, can you hear anything?

14:52.641 --> 14:54.143
-Shh.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.060
Hell no.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.855
Damn. Come on, let's try to get out.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.191
-My legs are asleep.
-Mo, shut the hell up.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.988
Mo, you're heavy as hell.
Mo, stand up. Stay there.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.036
Open the door real slow. Easy, easy, easy.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.580
Man, put some olive oil on the hinges.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.832
I'm not wasting olive oil on hinges.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.919
Oh, it's so loud.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.594
All right, what's next?

15:30.554 --> 15:33.349
Taking the trees back.
First in Palestine, now this?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.935
Yeah, right. Mo, stop playing, seriously.

15:36.018 --> 15:36.936
What's next?

15:37.728 --> 15:41.357
-You know how to unlock this thing?
-I'm the Black MacGyver. Got a paper clip?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.233
-No.
-Nigga, we're in Mexico.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.694
-What don't you understand?
-So what?

15:45.778 --> 15:46.987
I won't go empty-handed.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.658
Mo, at this point,
you'll be lucky if you even make it home.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.535
Those trees are mine!
I'm taking them back!

15:53.619 --> 15:56.580
Shut the hell up. You crazy?
They'll come out here and kill us.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.790
I don't give a shit!

15:57.873 --> 16:00.876
I'll tell these motherfuckers
to their face! I swear to God--

16:00.960 --> 16:03.087
Freeze, asshole!
Hands in the air!

16:03.170 --> 16:06.382
Hey, Jesus of Nazareth!
I don't--

16:06.465 --> 16:08.175
-Shut up!

16:08.258 --> 16:09.385
Shut the fuck-up!

16:11.220 --> 16:14.223
-I told you not to yell.
-Sorry, I got really emotional.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.017
Just so much built up inside.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.645
-Nothing like a shotgun to bring you back.
-Mo?

16:22.898 --> 16:25.150
-Manny?
-I thought that was your voice.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.445
-You know this nigga?
-Yeah, man, he works at the olive farm.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.657
Is there a bathroom I can use?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.328
Sorry you got caught up in all of this.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.164
Those stupid trackers
you put on the trees…

16:39.248 --> 16:43.752
-It's fine. Just give the trees back.
-No. I can't do that.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.798
Come on, Manny. You stole them
from Buddy's farm. Just give them back.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.594
My great, great,
great-grandfather was a native Karankawa.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.264
Our people lived there for generations.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.976
They thrived until the Spaniards
and Americans showed up.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.895
They drove us off our land.
Nearly killed us all.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.274
And you want me
to give him the trees back?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.234
I get it.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.736
I really do.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.282
We just suck as a human race.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.617
Manny, my family's from Haifa.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.621
We were forced out of there
by the Israelis into the West Bank.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.500
For 80 years,
it's bombs, bullets, and tear gas.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.170
Hell, they built a wall
separating families.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.840
Like this. Can never see each other again.
Can you imagine?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.468
Separating this family
from their own land?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.345
And what's land? It's a trust.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.348
We're supposed to take care of it.
We call it Mother Earth.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.852
But guess what? We fuck it in the ass.
Nothing's enough for the rich.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.064
They keep taking,
depleting Earth of its natural resources.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.274
Not enough for them.
They wanna go to Mars.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.859
We got Elon Musk just…

17:49.902 --> 17:52.571
jizzing Teslas into… into space.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.449
We went to the moon
and planted a flag like it's ours.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.160
-You know what I'm saying.
-What are you talking about?

17:58.243 --> 18:01.121
Yeah, you lost me
at balls-deep in Mother Earth.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.167
-Just give back the trees, Manny.
-Why do you care?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.795
I made a deal with Buddy.
If I get the trees back,

18:07.878 --> 18:10.380
he'll let my mom
press the olive oil on his farm.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.885
Tell you what.
I'll take three of them back to Houston.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.929
You can get the credit for that.

18:17.012 --> 18:20.724
Make it look like you retrieved them,
and he'll still cut a deal with you.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.852
Hey, hey, hey. Good things come in threes.

18:23.936 --> 18:28.524
Come on, the Trinity, wise men,
Destiny's Child, the Michelle version.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.651
-I like the Michelle.
-All right.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.824
-All right, you got a deal.
-You got it, man.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.786
-How do we get him across the border?
-I know people.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.538
What kind of people?

18:42.621 --> 18:43.622
<i>Polleros</i>.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.873
Coyotes.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.087
Let me know when you get the package.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.547
Copy. On my way.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.176
Hi, Juancho.

18:57.427 --> 19:00.597
-How's everything? Good?
-All is good, very chilled.

19:01.598 --> 19:04.935
-They're the guys I told you about. 'Sup?
-Sounds good.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.188
You sure about this?
How long have you known Manny?

19:08.272 --> 19:11.150
Not long, but what other choice do I have?
I gotta get back.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.611
Don't worry,
if shit goes down, I know aikido.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.531
Subdue two to three people,
use their momentum against them.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.200
-Shut up. You're not Steven Seagal.
-Just tying my camel.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.243
Shut up.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.828
Follow me.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.350
-Wait here, I'm gonna talk to these guys.
-All right.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.520
There's definitely asbestos in here.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.356
I feel my lungs tightening up.
I don't know how they do this.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.151
You know the cost for a coyote
to bring you across the border?

19:54.234 --> 19:56.111
-No.
-About 10,000 dollars.

19:56.195 --> 20:00.115
-Shit. Where did you get that information?
-I read it. In <i>Rolling Stone</i>.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.784
<i>Yeah, Rolling Stone,</i>
the authority on coyote rates.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.454
Great news.
They can get you through today.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.581
You're lucky. Some people wait weeks.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.250
Thank you, Manny.
I don't know what to say.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.253
-You're welcome. It's the least I can do.
-You with the cartel?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.881
Me? No, but my cousin
Matamoros is, though.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.508
Don't run from those guys.
They'll kill you.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.511
-Shit.
-All right. So what time we doing this?

20:21.595 --> 20:23.972
-"We" are not doing anything.
-Yes, "We."

20:24.056 --> 20:26.850
I told you I ain't letting you roll dolo.
We're doing this.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.937
You have a passport, man.
I only negotiated for Mo.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.607
You can go watch him cross,
but they'll charge you 10,000 dollars.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.691
See?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.195
-You talking about 10,000 dollars for me?
-Yeah.

20:38.278 --> 20:42.491
Oh. Well, in that case, you're definitely
gonna be good on your own.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.785
-I'll hold it down for you from the West.
-All right.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.954
All right? But, hey, I love you.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.958
-I love you too, bro.
-All right, stop playing. Come on.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.503
If I don't make it by tonight,
tell my mom not to worry.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.422
I already know how your mom is.
I'll definitely lie for you.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.758
-Thank you.
-Come on. I'll drive you across.

20:59.841 --> 21:03.053
-Mo, hang tight. They'll be with you soon.
-Right.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.347
Make sure your cartel cousin
takes care of my boy.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.598
-We got it.
-All right.

21:06.682 --> 21:10.435
-Yeah, how soon, though?
-You know, soon. Yeah.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.855
Is it five minutes? Ten minutes?
It's really creepy in here.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.423
You like soccer?

21:41.008 --> 21:44.428
I used to play soccer a lot
when I was your age.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.099
I speak three languages and…

21:50.309 --> 21:53.228
I don't have the words
to describe your situation.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.567
Is that your family?

21:59.860 --> 22:04.197
Take care of your family, okay?
Always take care of your family.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.743
-You got the money?
-What money?

22:07.826 --> 22:11.121
-You'll go nowhere if you don't pay us.
-There's been a misunderstanding.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.874
-Okay? Manny very specifically told me--
-Hey, hey…

22:14.374 --> 22:15.751
I'm fucking with you.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.753
So let's go.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.662
How old do you think
that kid was? Nine? Maybe ten?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.791
Man, what's with you and that boy?

22:55.874 --> 22:58.794
Just saying it's a lot
for a kid to go through. That's all.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.128
Yeah.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.880
Yes, it's very sad.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.841
Just thinking about
all the things that he's seen.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.970
Killings, kidnappings.
That's what they're fleeing, you know.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.474
-How do you have a normal life after that?
-Enough.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.352
Oh, what?
Is it getting at your conscience?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.397
Is that what it is? Do you give a fuck?

23:18.480 --> 23:22.192
No. You're profiting off of them.
Hell, you made it into a business.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.194
-Fucking pig.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.904
-He's a thick bastard.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.155
He don't jiggle.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.784
You close your borders…

23:30.867 --> 23:32.953
and buy our drugs.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.247
Who do you think made this business?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.082
Fuck.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.876
-I told you.
-He's a thick bastard.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.753
He's one tough fucking donut.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.759
Fucking assholes.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.763
You sure you're not Mexican?
You look like my cousin Hector.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.306
No, man, I'm Palestinian.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.766
Oh, from Pakistan.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.768
No, man. He's Indian. A big one.

23:56.852 --> 24:00.063
No, I'm not Pakistani.
Or Indian, okay? Like Jerusalem.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.649
-He's Israeli.
-They're all the same to me.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.317
No, it's a branding issue.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.362
This fucking bike is Chucho's.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.201
If I see him,
I'll cut off his dick and stick it in…

24:13.285 --> 24:15.328
Gonna cut off
whose dick and do what?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.663
So you are Mexican?

24:16.746 --> 24:19.458
No, I'm just from Alief,
everybody speaks some Spanish.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.504
-Is everything all right, guys? You sure?
-Everything's fine.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.424
Come on, piggy.
Let's go to America.

24:30.510 --> 24:34.181
-Huh. That's weird.
-What's weird? Is everything okay?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.182
Relax.

24:35.849 --> 24:39.686
America's on the other side.
It's half a mile. Good exercise.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.104
Good luck, fatty.

24:42.772 --> 24:43.815
Stop fat-shaming.

25:12.761 --> 25:13.720
What?

25:17.974 --> 25:19.935
Run, run away, shit!

25:21.561 --> 25:22.896
Oh, shit!

25:34.491 --> 25:35.575
Oh, shit.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.161
Fuck!

25:54.219 --> 25:55.053
Oh, shit!

26:01.059 --> 26:03.520
Why is he running? He must be in on it!

26:12.195 --> 26:13.238
Oh, shit.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.457
This fatty is thick and fast.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.249
You really fucked up now. Yeah.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.669
"I could do it, Buddy. Yeah.
I'm gonna get back the olive trees."

27:09.753 --> 27:12.672
"Of course, I can.
I'll get you some fucking avocados too."

27:12.756 --> 27:14.174
Yeah, real tough guy!

27:16.593 --> 27:17.469
Fuck!

27:37.697 --> 27:39.324
-Hello.
-Hey.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.161
-I didn't think you'd pick up.
-Yeah.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.791
-How are you?
-Oh, I'm doing good. Doing real great.

27:47.874 --> 27:51.586
Just getting some fresh air.
Getting those steps in.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.800
It's really good to hear your voice.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.551
I miss you.

28:00.762 --> 28:04.516
-You really hurt me, you know?
-I know. I fucked up.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.478
-I'm sorry.
-Like you don't trust me or something.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.439
Maria, I do trust you.
It won't happen again.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.360
<i>If we're ever gonna work,</i>
<i>you can't just shut me out like that.</i>

28:15.443 --> 28:18.571
It's like you have this big heart,
but you don't let me in it.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.115
<i>You're in my heart.</i>

28:20.198 --> 28:21.366
I love you.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.662
<i>I covered for you.</i>
<i>I lied to your mother.</i>

28:25.745 --> 28:29.124
<i>-No more lying.</i>
No more lies. I promise.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.085
You want to come over? Maybe…

28:32.752 --> 28:33.837
we talk about it?

28:33.920 --> 28:35.004
Hell yeah.

28:36.005 --> 28:39.342
I'll be there in like, you know,
about 15, 20 minutes or so.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.471
<i>Okay. Are you hungry?</i>
<i>We could order food.</i>

28:43.555 --> 28:46.349
<i>-We can order that Vietnamese--</i>
-I'm in Mexico.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.518
-New Mexico?
-<i>No, not New Mexico.</i>

28:48.601 --> 28:51.521
Old Mexico.
Like, for real, for real Mexico.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.816
Across the border Mexico?
What are you doing in Mexico?

28:54.899 --> 28:58.027
I was chasing these olive trees,
Nick came with me.

28:58.111 --> 29:01.156
And we got trapped in the back
of a box truck, and shit got out of hand.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.700
Chasing olives?
You don't have a fucking passport!

29:03.783 --> 29:06.911
<i>I know I don't have a passport.</i>
<i>I didn't think I'd end up in Mexico.</i>

29:06.995 --> 29:10.039
These coyotes were supposed
to help me get across in this tunnel,

29:10.123 --> 29:12.792
and the tunnel exploded,
and now they think I'm in on it.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.671
Why would I be in on it? I don't know
anything about smuggling and these…

29:17.922 --> 29:18.757
Babe…

29:18.840 --> 29:21.259
-Hey motherfucker!
-I think they found me.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.013
-Call your cousins. Shit!
-<i>What? Coyotes? What?</i>

29:25.096 --> 29:28.516
<i>Mo, where are you?</i>
<i>Mo! Mo, what's that sound?</i>

29:30.018 --> 29:31.895
<i>Mo! Where are you?</i>
