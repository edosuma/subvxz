WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:02.700
- Previously

00:02.700 --> 00:03.367
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.467 --> 00:06.133
A bar always needs a face,

00:06.166 --> 00:08.533
and we were thinking
of calling it TomTom.

00:08.567 --> 00:10.133
- What?

00:10.166 --> 00:11.567
- Sandoval, you're my
----ing partner.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.233
- We're ----ing
business partners!

00:13.266 --> 00:16.233
Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:16.266 --> 00:18.200
- The client asked
specifically for James

00:18.233 --> 00:20.233
to DJ our first opening party,

00:20.266 --> 00:22.233
so he's gonna
have to be there.

00:22.266 --> 00:24.133
- Is every Tuesday
gonna be Girls' Night?

00:24.166 --> 00:25.567
- You know,
I really hope not.

00:29.367 --> 00:31.500
- So do you want
to do this every Tuesday?

00:31.533 --> 00:35.066
- Congratulations,
you guys killed it.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.367
- James comes up.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.133
He starts, like, chirping
and taunting my dude.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.266
- What?

00:40.300 --> 00:41.467
- And then he goes
like this to him.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.033
And he goes,
"Oh, come on, lighten up.

00:43.066 --> 00:44.133
"We all know each other
inside and out,

00:44.166 --> 00:45.133
if you know what I mean."

00:45.166 --> 00:46.266
What?

00:46.300 --> 00:48.033
- I'm happy
that you came today.

00:48.066 --> 00:50.000
I want to, like, apologize
to Randall as well.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.333
Like, I do want to--
how should I do that?

00:51.367 --> 00:53.100
Like, should I write
a letter or something?

00:53.133 --> 00:54.500
- That has to be something
that you sit there

00:54.533 --> 00:55.567
and, like, you really mean.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.200
- Yeah.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.500
- Raquel, I'm sorry
I called you a twat.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.333
You're welcome.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.533
- ♪ You know that
it's our time ♪

01:11.567 --> 01:16.467
♪ These are the best days
of our lives ♪

01:16.500 --> 01:20.433
♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:20.467 --> 01:24.500
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:27.633 --> 01:31.133
- ♪ Oh, it's my turn ♪

01:33.200 --> 01:34.600
♪ We won't stop, no ♪

01:34.633 --> 01:37.300
♪ We won't stop, oh ♪

01:37.333 --> 01:39.567
- I cannot believe
that we are going

01:39.600 --> 01:43.100
to have a party here
in 24 hours.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.500
You better
get these lights done.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.300
Unfortunately for us,

01:46.333 --> 01:49.567
we committed to
the "DailyMailTV" party,

01:49.600 --> 01:51.533
but this was way
before we knew

01:51.567 --> 01:53.200
we were gonna be so delayed.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.033
We don't have water,
gas, or electricity.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.300
I mean, you won't be able
to go to the bathroom.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.300
You won't be able
to turn on the light.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.367
So try throwing a party
without that.

02:04.133 --> 02:05.500
I'm worried about
these chandeliers.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.266
- Oh, they're coming in.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.600
The hardest part's done.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.300
- The restaurant
might not be open,

02:10.333 --> 02:12.633
but we have
to deliver this party

02:12.667 --> 02:14.333
because we signed a contract.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.667
Oh!

02:17.700 --> 02:20.600
Would it be wrong for me
just to go to sleep here?

02:26.700 --> 02:28.667
- Trying to think
of what I need to do.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.700
First of all,
make sure that there's ice.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.333
Last I checked,
that ice machine

02:32.367 --> 02:34.066
was not ----ing working.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.100
We got to batch 900 cocktails.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.667
Make sure the garnishes
are on point.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.066
I got to make sure the step
and repeat is set up properly.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.100
What else? Uniforms.
Uniforms gotta be good.

02:45.133 --> 02:46.400
Make sure everybody's
got uniforms.

02:46.433 --> 02:50.367
They're supposed
to be ready...by tomorrow.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.700
Dude, if we don't have
----ing uniforms, man, like,

02:54.734 --> 02:58.200
Lisa will literally
flip the (BLEEP) out.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.533
- When Tom is superfrantic
and stressed out,

03:00.567 --> 03:03.567
I feel like the best way
to handle it is to kind of

03:03.600 --> 03:05.667
just let him run it off
like a toddler.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.300
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.266
I'll be here...
- Okay.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.633
- Holdin' it down.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.500
And then when he gets
all tuckered out,

03:13.533 --> 03:17.133
you can pick up the pieces
and take on a task.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.133
- Oh, oh, sh--.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.367
- Jesus Christ.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.200
- All right, dude, I get--

03:22.233 --> 03:23.500
I always feel like somebody's
gonna frickin' hit me.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.533
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.567
- All right, I texted Schwartz
about the prickly pear so...

03:28.600 --> 03:30.266
- Okay, cool.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.400
Schwartz is going over
to James' to, like,

03:32.433 --> 03:34.133
help him curate the--
- Get a playlist.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.533
- Yeah, the playlist.

03:35.567 --> 03:38.567
I got to grab my stuff
from the dry cleaning.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.567
It has to be ready today.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.500
- Okay, well,
we're gonna go there,

03:43.533 --> 03:45.533
and we're gonna get it.
- Okay.

03:45.567 --> 03:48.667
- And if it's not ready,

03:48.700 --> 03:51.667
we'll just
set the place on fire.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.767
- Okay.

03:59.633 --> 04:02.266
- Graham, come here.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.333
Come here.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.300
- This is so bad.
I can't even.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.633
- Well, what do you have?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.433
- "Dear Randall,
I basically just want to say

04:12.467 --> 04:15.300
"that every time I said
something disrespectful

04:15.333 --> 04:17.000
and stuff like that,
I take it back."

04:17.033 --> 04:19.533
The biggest reason why Lala
doesn't talk to me anymore

04:19.567 --> 04:20.667
and we're not friends
is because all of the sh--

04:20.700 --> 04:22.533
I've talked about Randall.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.633
You (BLEEP) the fat man
because he pays for your rent.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.300
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.000
Big fat ----ing Randall.

04:29.033 --> 04:31.600
- You've stood up
for me before

04:31.633 --> 04:34.533
when Lala has said
a rude remark.

04:34.567 --> 04:37.433
Now you're going ahead
and, like, trying

04:37.467 --> 04:40.000
to mend things with her
and you're kind of, like,

04:40.033 --> 04:42.000
dismissing my feelings
about it.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.533
- No, I'm not.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.667
- Are you and Lala gonna go out
and, like, hang out

04:45.700 --> 04:48.333
on these little,
like, friend dates?

04:48.367 --> 04:51.467
And what am I gonna do,
like, be at home with Graham?

04:51.500 --> 04:52.567
- No.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.734
- Because I'm not okay
with Lala.

04:53.767 --> 04:54.734
Lala's not my friend.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.433
- Wake up!

04:56.467 --> 04:58.533
- Lala, stop clapping
in my face!

04:58.567 --> 05:01.000
- Oh, you ----ing twat.

05:01.033 --> 05:04.367
- What am I gonna do while
you're besties with Lala?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.767
- Okay, then I won't
be besties with Lala.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.333
If it makes you unhappy,
I don't care.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.667
You're the one thing
that makes me happy.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.500
(BLEEP) this ----ing letter.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.533
Finally, there he is.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.767
- Hello?
- Hey, Raquel.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
- Come in.
- Hey, dude.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.300
- What's up, James?

05:27.333 --> 05:28.433
Hi, Raquel.
How you doing?

05:28.467 --> 05:29.567
Good to see you.
What's happening?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.367
Look at this nice setup.
- Thanks.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.500
- So we want to talk music.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.734
- Yes, this is a big client.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.500
By the way, I'm not here
to tell you

05:36.533 --> 05:38.300
what you can and can't do,
and I never will do that.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.500
- Well, now you can.
You're my boss now, dude.

05:40.533 --> 05:41.734
- Whoa.

05:41.767 --> 05:45.400
Whoa, flexing on
this mother----er.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.500
It feels good.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.266
Never really been
called boss before.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.266
Whoa, I like to feel
a little power.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.767
- Right.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.500
- I'm not gonna let it
go to my head.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.000
You know, I'm not gonna
get drunk with power.

05:56.033 --> 05:57.700
Put some
music together, bitch.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.300
- All right, calm down.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.367
- You know, just a little sip,
see how it tastes.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.066
Mmm, that tastes good.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.667
Are you gonna be at--
well, not to bring that up now,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.333
but I'm pretty sure
you're over that,

06:09.367 --> 06:11.300
the whole Girls' Night thing.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.567
- Oh, you know, I mean,
it's not that I'm over it.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.400
You know, it's not
salty either.

06:15.433 --> 06:18.000
You know, I'm happy that Sur
is doing well on Tuesdays,

06:18.033 --> 06:19.467
you know, since I'm gone.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.000
- Last night,
Billie talked to me,

06:22.033 --> 06:23.467
and she was like,
"I really, really want you

06:23.500 --> 06:27.100
to come to Girls' Night
tonight," so...

06:27.133 --> 06:29.633
I don't know.
I was thinking about going.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.367
- So you're going
to Girls' Night?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.000
- I was thinking about it.
- Why?

06:37.033 --> 06:38.767
And you don't want me to write
a ----ing letter to Randall

06:39.000 --> 06:40.033
and you're gonna go
to Girls' Night.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.100
- Well, why not?

06:42.133 --> 06:44.433
Talk about a contradiction.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.300
Don't write the letter to Lala

06:46.333 --> 06:47.667
'cause I don't want you
to be friends with her,

06:47.700 --> 06:49.567
but I'm gonna go
to Girls' Night tonight...

06:49.600 --> 06:51.100
- I'm not going for Lala.
- The night she's throwing...

06:51.133 --> 06:52.367
It's See You Next
----ing Tuesday,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.000
and you're going to Sur.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.333
- All right, well, I wasn't
invited last week.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.533
- Have fun tonight.
Have fun tonight.

06:56.567 --> 06:57.567
- Let's relax.
- I am relaxed.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.133
- Okay, okay.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.600
- What, are you gonna go back
to Jax and say

07:00.633 --> 07:02.300
I ----ing lost my sh-- again,
didn't I?

07:02.333 --> 07:03.567
- No, dude, chill.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.700
I know this is
a sensitive subject for you.

07:05.734 --> 07:08.033
I'm not here to--
I'm not here to rub it in.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.066
James.
- Babe.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.433
- James, dude,
he gets so ----ing--

07:12.467 --> 07:14.066
Oh, my God.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.734
This "DailyMailTV" party,
it's a huge deal,

07:16.767 --> 07:19.400
and we want everything
to go perfectly, you know.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.667
But James, he seems
a little unhinged.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.467
This is obviously
a major issue.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.567
- I think he plays it off
like he is resolved with it.

07:28.633 --> 07:29.734
- Oh, you all right, dude?

07:29.767 --> 07:31.433
- No, I'm not
all right, dude.

07:31.467 --> 07:32.433
I'm not all right.
- I didn't know this.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.700
Talk to me.
I thought--

07:33.734 --> 07:35.033
honestly, I thought--
- About what?

07:35.066 --> 07:36.467
What do you want to talk about?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.000
What conversations
do you want to have?

07:38.033 --> 07:39.033
- Hey, first of all, dude,
don't be contentious.

07:39.066 --> 07:40.700
- I'm not being contentious.

07:40.734 --> 07:42.166
Don't say that I'm freaking
out. I'm not freaking out.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.600
I'm having
a man-to-man conversation.

07:43.633 --> 07:45.066
- Okay.
- What do you want to know?

07:45.100 --> 07:46.433
- I didn't realize you
were gonna have

07:46.467 --> 07:48.066
such an emotional reaction
to this.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.600
- Dude, Girls' Night hurts
the (BLEEP) out of me.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.367
What do you think?
That was my ----ing night.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.567
Like, I'm pissed. I hate it.
I hate Katie for it.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.667
I'm sorry.
- You did it to yourself.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.467
- Yeah, I know that!
I know that!

07:56.500 --> 07:58.467
- Don't scapegoat Katie.
- I'm not scapegoating Katie.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.700
But I hate
all of them for it.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.066
- Okay.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.667
- How can I hide it?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.467
Is it helping Katie's bank?
No.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.600
Is it, you know,
affecting mine? Yeah.

08:09.633 --> 08:10.600
- Yeah.

08:10.633 --> 08:12.400
- Girls' Night!

08:12.433 --> 08:14.467
Let's all show up in ----ing
lingerie and be sluts

08:14.500 --> 08:16.667
and get drunk at Sur.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.400
Let's go black out at Sur.
Let's all get drunk.

08:18.433 --> 08:19.700
'Cause I know it was
a sh--show last time.

08:19.734 --> 08:21.500
I know everyone
got ----ing wasted.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.066
And they're all working,
right?

08:23.100 --> 08:25.700
But I can't--I can't drink
on the job, can I?

08:25.734 --> 08:28.633
- Well, James, I think
you're a phenomenal DJ.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.400
I just don't think
you're a phenomenal drinker.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.533
- Coming up...

08:33.567 --> 08:35.100
- You can talk to me
about everything.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.500
- Yeah.

08:36.533 --> 08:38.133
- But when you do it
with Stassi or Katie,

08:38.166 --> 08:40.100
I think it kind of is,
like, off-putting for them.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.100
- Well, I'm never gonna
win with them.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.633
I never have.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.033
- You never have,
and you probably never will.

08:58.066 --> 09:00.500
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

09:00.533 --> 09:02.567
- I'm doing good.
Any coffee for you?

09:02.600 --> 09:05.066
- Can I just do a macchiato?

09:05.100 --> 09:06.467
Hi, boo.
- Hi, baby.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.266
Hi, I love seeing
your pretty face.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.667
- I love seeing yours.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.066
I would love
an iced vanilla latte.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.066
- You have
really pretty eyes.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.567
- I appreciate you.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.734
- I'm sure you've never heard
that before.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.166
- All the time,
let me tell you.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.166
All right, so anything else
for you?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.467
- Yeah, that's it.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.734
- Do you double
as a cabana boy?

09:21.767 --> 09:23.433
- You say what?
- I'm just kidding.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.600
- Like, I do whatever I want,
let me tell you.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.567
- Oh, that baby.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.166
- Wouldn't mind seeing him with
his shirt off next to a pool.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.266
- Your vagina is, like,
calling for every dick ever.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.100
- No, not every dick anymore.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.233
- Really?
What does that mean?

09:36.266 --> 09:38.233
- Really? You don't know?
No one said anything yet?

09:38.266 --> 09:41.300
- About what?
- About me and Adam.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.667
- Are you guys a thing now?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.734
- No, we're not a thing.
We just had sex.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.734
- My mind is blown.

09:46.767 --> 09:51.066
- The situation Adam and I
are in right now is ideal.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.600
I'm a single woman.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.667
Neither of us want to be
in a relationship.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.533
We would rather
just hang and bang, you know.

09:56.567 --> 09:59.600
You hang out, bang it out,
best of both worlds.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.200
- So everyone, I felt,

10:01.233 --> 10:03.600
was so supportive
after my Pops passed.

10:03.633 --> 10:06.567
I'm like, what can I do
for them that's, like, fun.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.567
- You don't have
to do anything.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.133
We're your friends.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.667
We're gonna be here
for you no matter what.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.100
- I know, but it was like,
no one needed to be there.

10:13.133 --> 10:16.533
When my dad passed away,
the girls dropped everything

10:16.567 --> 10:18.033
to come to Utah and be with me,

10:18.066 --> 10:20.233
so I think that
it's time for me

10:20.266 --> 10:23.600
to give them
just a little thank-you.

10:23.633 --> 10:27.066
So I want to take
the girls on a trip.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.300
- Mm-hmm.
- It's in Solvang.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.734
It's, like, a winery.

10:29.767 --> 10:33.100
On the peej, just girls trip.
- Fun!

10:33.133 --> 10:35.633
Peej, PJ, private jet.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.333
It's like how Eskimos have
50 words for the word "snow."

10:39.367 --> 10:43.233
Lala has 50 words
for the word "private jet."

10:43.266 --> 10:46.266
- I'm inviting you,
Ariana, Stassi,

10:46.300 --> 10:50.633
Katie, Kristen, Britt.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.567
- Well, I'm hoping--
- I think a trip would be fun

10:52.600 --> 10:54.734
because, I mean, we've all
been getting along and, like...

10:54.767 --> 10:56.767
- Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.066
But as an observer, I think,
for some reason,

11:00.100 --> 11:02.233
you can talk to me
about everything.

11:02.266 --> 11:03.567
Like, we're in that place

11:03.600 --> 11:05.667
where you can go
on and on about Adam.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.333
You can go on and on
about whatever you want.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.367
I feel like when you do it
with either Stassi or Katie,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.667
because you guys
aren't in that place,

11:13.700 --> 11:16.133
maybe they feel
a bit overwhelmed.

11:16.166 --> 11:19.066
I can understand
why these girls

11:19.100 --> 11:20.734
think Scheana is annoying.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.667
- He's so handy with things.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.233
It's so sexy.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.166
Like, he, like,
took the hitch off his car,

11:26.200 --> 11:27.266
put it on mine,
hooked the boat up

11:27.300 --> 11:29.333
in, like, less than a minute.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.166
Like, I watched him put
a TV on the wall

11:31.200 --> 11:33.100
in, like, under seven minutes.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.100
Listen, I'm talking.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.700
- She can be a little annoying.

11:36.734 --> 11:40.734
- I think that I've been
trying, and maybe I shouldn't.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.266
You know?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.667
- Aw, Sheshu.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.633
I don't like--
- No, it's okay.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.133
I'm trying, but it's like,
if you don't want me to try,

11:48.166 --> 11:49.700
then I'll stop trying.

11:49.734 --> 11:51.400
- I think it's great that
you want to make things right,

11:51.433 --> 11:52.767
you want to please everybody,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.133
but as far as, like,
confiding in them,

11:55.166 --> 11:57.734
I think it kind of is,
like, off-putting for them.

11:57.767 --> 12:01.166
I really do want
to rebuild my friendship

12:01.200 --> 12:03.166
with Kristen,
Katie, and Stassi.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.166
We're people who all
used to be so close,

12:06.200 --> 12:08.166
and I have to admit it.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.400
I miss it.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.367
I shouldn't
try so hard sometimes.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.767
- That's the thing, Scheana,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.300
you're never gonna
always win with anybody.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.700
- Yeah, well, I'm never
gonna win with them.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.166
I never have.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.200
- You never have,
and you probably never will.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.233

12:37.266 --> 12:38.633
- I'm 39.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.400
- Happy birthday, honey.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.166
I love you.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.767
- I love you too.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.333
- Did you guys invite Raquel
to come here tonight?

12:46.367 --> 12:48.367
Or someone extended--
- It's not an invitation.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.133
- She wanted to come
and represent with the girls,

12:51.166 --> 12:53.367
you know, and once
she said that to James,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.767
he's like,
"You want to go to my night,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.700
my ----ing See You N-T,"

12:57.734 --> 13:00.033
and he, like, ----ing
completely flipped his lid.

13:00.066 --> 13:02.233
He blew up,
he started talking sh-- to me,

13:02.266 --> 13:03.734
and he started, like,
belittling me a little bit,

13:03.767 --> 13:05.367
and then he's like, "No,
(BLEEP) all those girls.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.066
----ing bunch of whores
on the bar."

13:07.100 --> 13:09.400
And then he--but--and then
he reeled it back in.

13:09.433 --> 13:10.633
He's like, "Sorry, so"--

13:10.667 --> 13:12.133
- No, why do you make excuses?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.467
- No, no, no, he did.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.767
No, within--within--within
three seconds,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.166
he said, "I'm sorry."

13:16.200 --> 13:19.100
Honestly, I felt
kind of bad for the guy.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.633
- I don't really care
how James is feeling

13:21.667 --> 13:25.133
'cause he hasn't given
a thought to how I feel

13:25.166 --> 13:27.667
or anyone else that he speaks
to the way he does.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.100
So why should I give
a (BLEEP) if he's sad?

13:30.133 --> 13:32.367
- Show 'em your girls.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.633
Look at the girls.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.233
Whoo!

13:46.266 --> 13:47.467

13:47.500 --> 13:48.700
- Hey, I'm really excited
for tomorrow.

13:48.734 --> 13:50.033
You got a big client in there,

13:50.066 --> 13:51.400
your first client.
- I know.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.400
"DailyMailTV" is huge.
- Yeah, they're huge.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.200
- We're a little
overwhelmed, actually.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.700
- Yo, dude.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.233
Oh!

13:58.266 --> 13:59.266
- That place
is gonna be packed tomorrow.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.400
It's gonna be utter chaos.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.200
- We have
a ----ing lot to do.

14:02.233 --> 14:06.033
- Tomorrow
is a huge night for me,

14:06.066 --> 14:07.266
and it's a huge night
for TomTom.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.367
A client paid
a sh--load of money,

14:10.400 --> 14:13.133
and they expect you
to deliver a product,

14:13.166 --> 14:16.333
and if you can't,
it's not good.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.200
- Good to see you
back in the saddle.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.400
Make me a drink, bitch.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.667
Make it one of those
signature mojitos.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.233
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.

14:33.266 --> 14:34.300
- What's going on?
- How's it going?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.300
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.033
Need drinks tonight.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.533
- Hey, do me a favor.
Can you make me a drink?

14:39.567 --> 14:41.233
Make me something
extraordinary.

14:41.266 --> 14:43.166
- Yes, I'll be right back.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.300
- Anyway, listen.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.767
- What's that, money?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.166
- No.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.734
It's a kind of
termed agreement.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.533
It's pretty standard.
- Yeah.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.133
- These guys have been going
on and on and on

14:57.166 --> 14:58.400
about the term sheet.

14:58.433 --> 15:00.367
- Oh, we were just
gonna ask you, um,

15:00.400 --> 15:01.700
if you've had a chance
to come up

15:01.734 --> 15:03.066
with some sort
of term sheet.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.133
- You will have
your term sheet.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.367
It's in the works, okay?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.100
You will have it.
- Okay, okay.

15:08.133 --> 15:11.433
- I never want to do
anything in writing.

15:11.467 --> 15:15.500
I would prefer, for a 5% deal,
a handshake.

15:15.533 --> 15:18.333
But if you want this,
then you can have it.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.166
More importantly,
when it's a partnership,

15:21.200 --> 15:25.400
it's about trust, right?

15:27.367 --> 15:29.233
Do you understand that?
- We understand.

15:29.266 --> 15:34.033
I feel like I'm being inducted
into a Mafia organization,

15:34.066 --> 15:37.266
and if I cross her,
I'm gonna get whacked.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.367
- I hope you feel that we
definitely do have your back

15:40.400 --> 15:41.500
and have your best interests.

15:41.533 --> 15:44.100
- Okay, just don't
let me down.

15:45.367 --> 15:50.433
- So I want you guys
to come with me

15:50.467 --> 15:53.567
on a little girls' trip
so that I can thank everybody

15:53.600 --> 15:57.533
for being there for me
when my Pop passed away.

15:57.567 --> 16:01.367
So I want to take you guys
to a place called Solvang.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
- Is that that,
like, little Dutch place?

16:03.433 --> 16:04.767
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.567
- I love Solvang.
- You love it?

16:06.600 --> 16:08.100
Okay, so we're gonna go,

16:08.133 --> 16:09.500
'cause I really want
to get you guys,

16:09.533 --> 16:11.300
like, white girl wasted.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.000
- Bobo's like, ooh.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.200
It's, like,
a two-hour drive,

16:20.233 --> 16:24.200
but I don't really like
being in the car that much,

16:24.233 --> 16:28.000
so we'll just fuel the J
and head on out.

16:28.033 --> 16:29.233
It's, like,
a 20-minute flight.

16:29.266 --> 16:31.100
'Cause then we can
literally just,

16:31.133 --> 16:32.467
like, show up
and have fun.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.333
- I'm imagining just,
like, lots of alcohol,

16:35.367 --> 16:37.333
being able to do
whatever I want.

16:37.367 --> 16:41.133
Like, if I want to, like, have,
like, my tray down on takeoff.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.400
I'm gonna, like, channel,

16:44.433 --> 16:47.300
like, my inner ----ing
J.Lo right now,

16:47.333 --> 16:48.533
my Beyoncé.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.367
And just be like,
who run the world?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.600
(BLEEP) yeah,
on a jet for 20 minutes.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.400
- You're gonna break my hand.
- Who are you kidding?

16:54.433 --> 16:56.233
I'm sorry.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.066
- Coming up...

16:58.100 --> 16:59.567
Okay, I need somebody
to clean this floor out here.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.300
- Lisa, what's
the address here?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.200
89 what?
- 8932.

17:03.233 --> 17:06.066
- Maybe this will be
my sole duty at TomTom.

17:18.433 --> 17:22.367
- Okay, I need somebody
to clean this floor out here.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.100
Okay, everything's got
to come off the bar, Santi.

17:25.133 --> 17:28.333
We don't have to have
everything in order.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.166
We don't have
to have the menus.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.100
We don't have to have
the kitchen up and running.

17:32.133 --> 17:35.533
We've got to get every
piece of crap out of here.

17:35.567 --> 17:39.567
But we have to have the look of
the place absolutely spot on,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.433
otherwise, they'll be
really disappointed.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.266
- I've never batched
in such large quantities.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.667
- I just hope tonight that
we have enough drinks premade.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.533
- Are we gonna pull this off?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.600
- Dude, we're gonna pull this
off, man. Come on, man.

17:50.633 --> 17:53.200
Dude, can you believe
our drinks that we created

17:53.233 --> 17:55.200
are gonna be the first ones
served at TomTom?

17:55.233 --> 17:57.333
- Oh, God!
Oh!

17:57.367 --> 17:59.166
This is exciting.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.633
Ah, yeah.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.667
Well, I better not drink--
I'll save that one.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.467
Yeah, yeah.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.600
- ♪ I'm in it for the chase ♪

18:11.633 --> 18:14.700
♪ I'm in it for the race ♪

18:14.734 --> 18:19.133
♪ I'm gonna win first place ♪

18:19.166 --> 18:21.233
- I'm gonna be like this
coming out of here.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.333
Sodium overload.

18:23.367 --> 18:24.467
- Happy birthday.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.633
- Thank you.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.533
- I love you.
- I love you too.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.200
Next two birthdays
are good ones

18:29.233 --> 18:30.633
'cause this is
my last year in my 30s,

18:30.667 --> 18:32.300
and the next one's 40.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.700
- You'll be a married man
next year.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.200
- Oh, yeah.

18:35.233 --> 18:36.700
I'll be married.

18:36.734 --> 18:40.500
- Tomorrow we are gonna go look
at the engagement party venue.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.400
It's called
Inn of the Seventh Ray.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.700
- Where'd you find this place?

18:43.734 --> 18:45.400
- Actually, Katie
brought it to my attention.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.433
- Here's our crab cheese dip.
- Yeah.

18:47.467 --> 18:48.667
- And some shrimp cocktail.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.533
- Nice.
- Awesome, thank you.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.266
- So good.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.266
I could eat that for days.
- Mmm.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.767
- I want to see them
carry our beer cheese.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.467
- We should have brought
a sample or something.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.266
I didn't know.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.467
- I think this is a great
kind of place for that.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.166
- Yeah, we can come back
and bring one.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.633
- Yeah, you put it
with a pretzel or something.

19:04.667 --> 19:05.700
I think this kind of place
would be cool for it, right?

19:07.333 --> 19:08.533
My sister's calling me.

19:08.567 --> 19:09.767
- Oh.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.633
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.133
- Yeah, what are you guys
doing today?

19:13.166 --> 19:14.133
- Just having lunch.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.433
- Hi, Jenny.

19:16.467 --> 19:18.367
- I love you, miss you.

19:19.734 --> 19:21.567
- It's my last year
in my 30s.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.667
It's not that big of a deal,
but it's a big deal to me, 39.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.700
- Oh, I know, I got a little
emotional about that

19:29.734 --> 19:31.533
this morning, 'cause usually,

19:31.567 --> 19:35.367
we talk and do a shot
or something, you know, or...

19:35.400 --> 19:38.166
- One of the first things
I get in the morning

19:38.200 --> 19:41.400
when I wake up on my birthday
is usually a call from my dad.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.500
Yeah.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.700
For some reason, I thought
maybe the phone would ring.

19:45.734 --> 19:47.266
I don't know what
was going through my head.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.500
So I listened
to his voicemails,

19:49.533 --> 19:51.266
but it was tough.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.767
- Yeah.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.700
- Yes.

19:57.734 --> 20:00.433
- It was very happy birthday.
That was it.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.300
- That's it.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.233
My mother would call me
every morning on my birthday

20:05.266 --> 20:08.667
and tell me the story
of how I was born every year.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.567
She would pick up the phone.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.700
She's like, "I'm on my way
to the hospital 39 years ago.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.533
I remember this day.
It was hot as hell."

20:14.567 --> 20:16.467
She would just
go right into it.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.467
She's like, "Your dad was just
getting his cup of coffee."

20:18.500 --> 20:19.734
Every year.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.033
I'd always get
the same call every year.

20:24.767 --> 20:27.400
And I didn't get it this year.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.333
Ugh, I--I get emotional.

20:29.367 --> 20:32.033
I can't talk about it
too much.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.500
- My mother and I
haven't spoken

20:33.533 --> 20:35.333
pretty much
since my father passed.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.633
The bottom line is,
I just wasn't 100% okay

20:39.667 --> 20:41.767
with the way
his cancer was handled.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.667
It still just doesn't give--

20:43.700 --> 20:45.333
I feel like--I don't know.

20:45.367 --> 20:46.333
I feel like she should
reach out to me.

20:46.367 --> 20:47.633
I'm the son.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.333
All right, I'm gonna
finish my lunch here.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.333
I'm gonna call you
in a little bit.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.600
- Okay, all right.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.467
- Okay, thanks for the call.
Tell Patrick hi.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.467
- Love you too.
- Bye, Jenny.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.767
- All right, bye.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.767
- I can't talk about
my dad too much, just--

20:57.000 --> 20:58.567
- I know.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.367
Do you really want
your mom to call you?

21:02.467 --> 21:04.000
- I don't know.

21:04.033 --> 21:05.567
Sometimes.
I have my moments.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.734
I just don't understand
why she's so angry.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.500
Makes me really upset.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.533
Argh.
- I'm sorry, honey.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.734
- I have a leak
that's been going on

21:19.767 --> 21:21.500
since 9:00 in the morning.

21:21.533 --> 21:23.300
I don't have any air
conditioning in the kitchen.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.767
- Where's the leak
coming from?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.467
- The same place
it's been coming from

21:26.500 --> 21:28.300
since 9:00 this morning.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.533
Something's gone wrong
with an air conditioning unit.

21:30.567 --> 21:31.734
It's sweltering hot.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.400
And the clock is ticking.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.767
Actually, no,
even the clock's not ticking.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.400
- Sorry, I have
to take this real quick.

21:41.433 --> 21:44.266
It's about uniforms.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.734
Guys, the machine's
not working,

21:45.767 --> 21:47.333
so I'm getting ice delivered.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.600
- Okay, um, sh--.

21:49.633 --> 21:53.533
- You are cordially invited
to the "DailyMailTV" party

21:53.567 --> 21:55.567
to have a warm drink
without any ice.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.734
You will be absolutely
boiling hot

21:57.767 --> 21:59.533
'cause there's
no air conditioning.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.767
- Dude, there's no toilet seat
on one of the bathrooms.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.367
- That's okay.
That's okay.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.066
- What do you mean?
It's not okay.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.633
- Oh, and by the way, could
you also wear your diaper?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.467
- Hey, I wanted to see if
I could get some ice delivered.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.433
Let's do 700 pounds.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.300
Hey, Lisa,
what's the address here?

22:18.333 --> 22:20.700
89 what?
- 8932.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.433
- 8932.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.533
- Maybe this will be
my sole duty at TomTom.

22:25.567 --> 22:28.467
I feel like it's the one
I'm best suited for.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.367
Oh, sh--, I didn't see these.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.600
What is that for, tissues?

22:34.633 --> 22:36.433
- Here's the rest of these--

22:36.467 --> 22:38.033
- All right, listen, you guys,
I really have to go.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.500
Let's just talk about
the guest list quickly.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.000
- Okay.
- Yeah?

22:42.033 --> 22:44.567
- It's the "DailyMailTV's"
party, okay?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.066
So don't be kind of suddenly
saying to all your friends,

22:47.100 --> 22:49.400
"Oh, come on, let's go.
We're opening TomTom."

22:49.433 --> 22:50.533
We're not,
just doing the party.

22:50.567 --> 22:51.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:51.567 --> 22:52.667
This is their event so...

22:52.700 --> 22:55.100
I mean, obviously,
Katie, Ariana.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.600
- Yeah.

22:56.633 --> 22:57.700
- Lala's here working the door.

22:57.734 --> 22:59.500
Scheana will be standing by.

22:59.533 --> 23:02.767
Peter are my eyes
on the floor, okay?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.433
- And, well, Jax,
his birthday, eh...

23:05.467 --> 23:09.367
- You know what,
I will let Jax come

23:09.400 --> 23:12.066
because it's his first birthday
as well without his father.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.433
- He'll appreciate that.

23:13.467 --> 23:15.700
- Brittany, of course.
She's with Jax.

23:15.734 --> 23:17.133
It's gonna be
a tough one for him.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.133
- And also while
we're on the subject,

23:18.166 --> 23:19.500
I did invite Stas too.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.734
- Oh, for God's sake.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.734
What has she
got to do with anything?

23:21.767 --> 23:22.767
- And he invited Kristen.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.467
- Well, not--not formally.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.400
- You invited Kristen?
Now you're pissing me off.

23:26.433 --> 23:29.100
There are certain things
that don't travel well

23:29.133 --> 23:30.633
that you leave behind,

23:30.667 --> 23:33.600
and one of those happens to be
Kristen Doute.

23:33.633 --> 23:35.200
- Text her or whatever and let
her know that she can't come.

23:35.233 --> 23:36.433
- All right,
I'll tell Kristen.

23:36.467 --> 23:37.633
- Are we all
on the same page?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.066
- I am bringing
my dog walker

23:39.100 --> 23:40.600
and my, uh...

23:40.633 --> 23:41.633
- Exactly.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.600
- My hair stylist as well.

23:43.633 --> 23:44.700
- You know, come on, guys.

23:44.734 --> 23:47.133
- So harsh.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.500
- Of course I wish Kristen
could come tonight.

23:48.533 --> 23:49.767
I wish everybody could come,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.600
but right now,
Lisa has the final say,

23:51.633 --> 23:54.133
so I'm just gonna let
Schwartz deal with that one.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.667
- So just remember,
you got to do the ice.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.767
You've got to make sure
the uniform's done.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.667
You know, just,
like, look at everything.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.667
Okay?
- Okay.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.066
- What are you wearing?

24:02.100 --> 24:03.433
- Um, we have, uh,
matching suits.

24:03.467 --> 24:04.734
- We got a surprise for you.

24:06.233 --> 24:07.567
- Okay.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.567
- "Dumb and Dumber."

24:08.600 --> 24:09.767
- You said it.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.367
- Oh, sh--,
we have two hours.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.533
For real.
- That's fine. That's fine.

24:13.567 --> 24:14.767
- I got to go.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.533
- Lisa, don't worry.
We got it.

24:16.567 --> 24:17.667
- Something like that.
I don't know.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.633
- Okay, thanks.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.433
I don't know
if they're prepared for this

24:21.467 --> 24:24.000
kind of responsibility,
but go ahead, Tom and Tom.

24:24.033 --> 24:25.233
Take it away.

24:25.266 --> 24:26.500
Okay, good-bye.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.734
- We'll see you
in a little bit.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.100
- Coming up...

24:32.133 --> 24:33.600
- I noticed there's,
like, a little...

24:33.633 --> 24:34.767
Is that James' cubbyhole?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.467
- It's his time-out area.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.166
- Oh, my God, there he is!

24:39.533 --> 24:41.233
- James!

24:50.033 --> 24:51.700
- Want me to do the back too?

24:51.734 --> 24:54.166
- No, you know what, I think
I want the front to be good

24:54.200 --> 24:56.166
but the back to be wrinkled.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.133
- Ha, ha.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.700
All right, I hope
I don't (BLEEP) this up.

25:00.734 --> 25:03.233
- I'm so excited
to see TomTom.

25:03.266 --> 25:04.600
I feel like this has been

25:04.633 --> 25:06.233
a part of our lives for,
like, six years.

25:06.266 --> 25:08.200
Granted, it's only been,
like, two years,

25:08.233 --> 25:11.066
but it feels like
for-freaking-ever.

25:11.100 --> 25:16.033
Beau is hands down the best
boyfriend that I have ever had.

25:16.066 --> 25:18.200
I am honestly not used to this.

25:18.233 --> 25:21.667
All of my ex-boyfriends, they
would say that they loved me

25:21.700 --> 25:23.266
or say that they
really cared about me,

25:23.300 --> 25:27.000
but Beau shows
how much he cares for me.

25:28.767 --> 25:31.233
- You're ----ing kidding me.

25:31.266 --> 25:33.233
Uh, son of a bitch.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.066
Can you get out
your blow-dryer?

25:35.100 --> 25:37.200
- Why?
- No reason.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.166
- Come here.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.266
Yeah, ba-boy, guess what?

25:44.300 --> 25:47.533
Papa hasn't been home
because he's been busy

25:47.567 --> 25:50.500
opening a bar,
but after tonight,

25:50.533 --> 25:52.633
he'll have plenty of time
to hang out with you.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.100
- Text Katie Maloney.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.700
I'm almost ready.

25:56.734 --> 26:00.100
Do you want to share a Lyft
to TomTom?

26:00.133 --> 26:02.567
- Okay, it's sent.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
- Thanks!

26:12.100 --> 26:13.734
- Are you just gonna be home?

26:13.767 --> 26:15.133
Are you leaving?
Are you going out?

26:15.166 --> 26:16.633
What are you doing?

26:16.667 --> 26:18.600
- Uh, I'm gonna chill
for a little while.

26:18.633 --> 26:20.633
How many people
are they expecting?

26:20.667 --> 26:22.233
- I don't know.

26:22.266 --> 26:24.066
I'm excited because
I've only seen photos.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.166
- I know, I'm so jealous.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.600
I wish I could go.
- I know.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.300
- I'm not cool enough
for the "Daily Mail" party.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.600
- I'm really glad I just got
----ing ready for no reason.

26:51.633 --> 26:54.100
- Why, what happened?

26:54.133 --> 26:56.166
- Schwartz just texted me.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.700
"The party
is way over capacity,

26:57.734 --> 27:00.233
"and Lisa is adamant
that you shouldn't come.

27:00.266 --> 27:02.033
"Tom and I would love
for you to be there,

27:02.066 --> 27:04.300
but she is insisting.
Sorry."

27:04.333 --> 27:07.033
Stassi's gonna go,
but I don't get to go.

27:07.066 --> 27:08.300
- You don't get to go.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.734
- Literally everyone,
everyone but me.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.233
I was just so excited.

27:12.266 --> 27:13.667
I was so proud of them.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.233
I just want to,
like, see the space.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.600
I want to celebrate
with all of my friends.

27:16.633 --> 27:18.166
I went and got them
----ing flowers.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.700
- I know.
- I bought boys flowers.

27:19.734 --> 27:22.600
I've definitely had
a few incidences

27:22.633 --> 27:23.767
throughout the years.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.066
Walk the (BLEEP) away.
Bye.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.166
Suck a dick.

27:27.200 --> 27:31.233
But that was forever ago.

27:31.266 --> 27:32.667
- Are y'all ----ing kidding me?

27:32.700 --> 27:34.333
- Why is she
so obsessed with me?

27:34.367 --> 27:37.667
Lisa, you do so many
wonderful things in this world,

27:37.700 --> 27:39.734
but you hold onto that
as your hobby?

27:39.767 --> 27:41.633
Like, try knitting.

27:41.667 --> 27:45.133
- Well, that's one way
to fix it.

27:45.166 --> 27:46.367
- Cheers to TomTom.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.433
- Cheers to TomTom.

27:52.233 --> 27:54.367
- Oh, my God, we got uniforms.
Hallelujah.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.100
Got uniforms.
- All right.

27:59.433 --> 28:01.633
- Hey, guys.

28:14.767 --> 28:17.400
- So what we were thinking
is connecting the bluetooth

28:17.433 --> 28:20.033
through the iPad.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.367
- What iPad?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.600
- There's an iPad over here
in the office.

28:22.633 --> 28:25.000
- Okay.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.400
Whoo, it's hot in here.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.300
So I'm DJing in here?

28:31.333 --> 28:32.333
Hmm.

28:32.367 --> 28:33.767
- Okay.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.266
What are you thinking?

28:35.300 --> 28:36.700
- I'm thinking--
I'm thinking I'm gonna...

28:36.734 --> 28:37.767
- Because that room doesn't
have an outlet.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.467
- Be sitting on these boxes

28:39.500 --> 28:42.300
DJing in this closet
for the night.

28:42.333 --> 28:43.400
That's what I think.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.233
All right, I'm gonna explain

28:45.266 --> 28:46.667
what exactly is wrong
with the DJ booth at TomTom.

28:46.700 --> 28:47.667
Here we go.
Ready?

28:47.700 --> 28:49.066
There isn't one.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.700
- I touched my balls after
muddling that jalapeño,

29:03.734 --> 29:05.767
and my ----ing nutsack
is on fire.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.266
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.400
- Dude, it got
in my nostrils last night.

29:09.433 --> 29:11.133
Is your nuts really on fire?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.433
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.033
- How cool does that look?
- I love it.

29:14.066 --> 29:15.700
- I like it all the way up.

29:15.734 --> 29:18.300
- Okay,
be a little different.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.000
- Yeah, I like it like that.

29:20.033 --> 29:21.700
We gotta go, dude.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.700
I kind of don't want
this moment to end, you know?

29:27.734 --> 29:29.200
- Do some Toms?

29:29.233 --> 29:30.467
- No, no, wait.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.734
- Yeah.
both: Tom.

29:32.767 --> 29:35.667
- Om is an ancient
Hindu syllable.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.433
both: Tom.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.667
- It's supposed
to represent every vibration

29:39.700 --> 29:42.000
ever created in the universe.

29:42.033 --> 29:43.166
- One more.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.500
both: Tom.
- All right.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.200
So I figure, you know what,

29:46.233 --> 29:48.133
we'll just slap a T
in front of that bad boy,

29:48.166 --> 29:49.300
and then you got it.

29:49.333 --> 29:53.133
I can feel the mojo rising,
you know.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.033
I feel like a man.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.033
I still have jalapeño dick.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.467
- Coming up...

30:03.500 --> 30:05.100
- What's this?

30:05.133 --> 30:06.400
This is where you're DJing?
- Dude.

30:06.433 --> 30:08.133
- Are you in a closet?

30:08.166 --> 30:09.467
- Yes.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.400
- There's so many things
I could say right now

30:11.433 --> 30:13.333
that I'm not gonna say
'cause I'm nice guy.

30:25.233 --> 30:27.200
- All right, guys, we're open!

30:27.233 --> 30:29.100
- Whoo!

30:29.133 --> 30:30.500
- Thank you all.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.266
- Yeah, thank you, guys.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.567
- Cheers, buddy.
- Whoa, dude, this is a moment.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.233
- I love you, dude.

30:35.266 --> 30:36.500
Come here.
- I'm gonna--

30:36.533 --> 30:40.200
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna cry.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.467
I'm gonna cry later.

30:44.567 --> 30:46.500
- Hi!
- Hi!

30:46.533 --> 30:48.767
- Oh, my God, hey.
- How you doing?

30:49.000 --> 30:50.367
- I love this color scheme
and everything.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.166
- This is so crazy.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.500
TomTom is chic AF.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.567
This is, like,
the most lit restaurant

30:57.600 --> 31:01.367
I've seen in a minute.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.066
Enjoy, you guys.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.400
- Whoo!

31:06.066 --> 31:08.233
Oh, you guys.
Oh, my gosh.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.033
I haven't seen it yet.

31:11.066 --> 31:12.367
Oh, my God,
I got chill bumps.

31:14.066 --> 31:15.633
- I need to see
if you're on the list.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.100
- What the actual (BLEEP)?

31:18.133 --> 31:19.467
- It's really cool in there.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.300
You have to go in the back.
- Oh.

31:21.333 --> 31:23.266
- Oh, my God.

31:23.300 --> 31:24.400
- Are you excited?

31:24.433 --> 31:26.533
I'm excited.
- I'm so excited.

31:26.567 --> 31:29.100
Oh, my God.

31:29.133 --> 31:31.533
Oh, my God.
- Wait, oh, it's--oh, my God.

31:31.567 --> 31:33.300
- Hi.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.567
My table that are
with men that own a bar.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.266
You're on the list.
You're on the list.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.133
- I cannot--

31:43.166 --> 31:45.467
TomTom, oh, my gosh.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.100
- I am so proud
of Tom and Tom and Lisa.

31:48.133 --> 31:49.633
They've completely
outdone themselves.

31:49.667 --> 31:51.266
- Here come the boys!

31:51.300 --> 31:54.500
- Hey, Bubba.
- I know.

31:54.533 --> 31:56.433
- Did I dream this?
- I'm gonna cry.

31:56.467 --> 31:59.033
- This is gonna be where
all of us hang out forever.

31:59.066 --> 32:00.333
This will be our Central Perk.

32:00.367 --> 32:01.467
It will be our Max.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.300
It will be our Peach Pit.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.166
I'm so excited to just
spend every night here,

32:06.200 --> 32:07.633
and I'm excited
for some free drinks.

32:07.667 --> 32:10.333
- This is just unreal.

32:10.367 --> 32:11.600
- I am--I'm blown away.

32:11.633 --> 32:13.300
I really am
----ing blown away.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.100
Like, in my wildest dreams,

32:15.133 --> 32:17.033
like, I couldn't come up
with something this pretty.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.667
- Hi, Lala.
- Congratulations, how are you?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.200
- How are you?

32:25.233 --> 32:28.300
It looks so good.
I love it.

32:28.333 --> 32:29.667
Don't you love it?

32:29.700 --> 32:31.300
We did it!

32:31.333 --> 32:32.433
- Yeah!

32:32.467 --> 32:34.233
- It is good.
- I need a drink.

32:34.266 --> 32:36.033
- Hi, Lisa!
- Oh, my God.

32:36.066 --> 32:37.533
Oh, my God,
there he is.

32:37.567 --> 32:39.066
- James!

32:44.266 --> 32:45.467
- Cheers, everybody!

32:45.500 --> 32:46.667
- Cheers, everybody!

32:46.700 --> 32:49.400
- Welcome to TomTom!

32:49.433 --> 32:51.467
- I'm on a new streak.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.100
- A new streak?

32:53.133 --> 32:54.333
- I'm on a behaving streak.

32:54.367 --> 32:55.633
- Lisa.
- You can do it.

32:55.667 --> 32:58.100
- Holy sh--.
- We did it.

32:58.133 --> 32:59.700
- Oh, my gosh,
you look gorgeous.

32:59.734 --> 33:01.400
- We did it.

33:01.433 --> 33:03.233
What do you think?
Do you like it?

33:03.266 --> 33:04.600
- It is so beautiful.

33:04.633 --> 33:07.066
- I've never seen
anything like it.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.300
- Gorgeous.

33:08.333 --> 33:12.200
- Lisa, it's stunning.
We cried.

33:12.233 --> 33:14.333
- Just to see
this come to fruition

33:14.367 --> 33:16.467
and see this masterpiece...

33:16.500 --> 33:17.700
- It's incredible.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.633
Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.166
- It's magical.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.500
- Look at how pretty
that drink is.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.233
- I know, well, we've
worked really hard on it.

33:24.266 --> 33:25.367
- Why does she match it?

33:25.400 --> 33:26.600
- You've got to hold
that cocktail

33:26.633 --> 33:27.700
with what you're wearing.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.500
- Take a picture
with the drink.

33:29.533 --> 33:31.500
- Anyway, cheers to you girls.

33:31.533 --> 33:34.567
I think, actually,
after all the work,

33:34.600 --> 33:36.400
I would like to pat
myself on the back and say,

33:36.433 --> 33:37.533
"You know what,
I deserve a drink,"

33:37.567 --> 33:39.700
but that would be wrong.

33:39.734 --> 33:41.467
I deserve to get slaughtered.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.500
- I noticed there's,
like, a little cutout.

33:44.533 --> 33:46.200
Is that James' cubbyhole?

33:46.233 --> 33:47.633
- It's his time-out area.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.633
- And then you just--you
lock him in there when he's--

33:49.667 --> 33:51.400
So it's kind of like Rapunzel.

33:51.433 --> 33:54.500
He has to let down his hair.
- No microphone.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.633
- I don't want to work
with James at Sur,

33:56.667 --> 33:59.333
but I don't mind
drinking at TomTom

33:59.367 --> 34:01.633
while James
is locked in a closet.

34:04.567 --> 34:05.667
- Hi.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.533
It looks amazing.
Mwah, mwah.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.266
This is beautiful.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.700
- Happy birthday.
- Yes, it's my birthday, 39.

34:10.734 --> 34:12.433
- No!
- 39.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.333
- 39.
- My last year in my 30s.

34:14.367 --> 34:15.700
- You've been lying then.

34:15.734 --> 34:17.500
- Many, many years, yes.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.333
I'm embracing being 39,

34:19.367 --> 34:22.633
and I haven't said my actual
age in--since I was 17.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.400
I'm excited 'cause
I'm gonna turn 40 next year.

34:25.433 --> 34:27.433
I'm excited to be 40.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.533
Can't believe I'm gonna be 40.
Sh--.

34:29.567 --> 34:34.533
- I know it's the first time
without your father.

34:34.567 --> 34:36.400
- Right, I actually had
a good cry this morning

34:36.433 --> 34:39.166
just because every year on
my birthday, my dad calls me.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.533
I don't want to get into it.

34:40.567 --> 34:42.166
It's my birthday.
I wanna be happy today.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.600
I want to enjoy it,
but I have Brittany.

34:43.633 --> 34:46.300
I have her parents,
so I'm happy.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.467
- What, do you mean
your mother

34:47.500 --> 34:49.200
hasn't acknowledged
your birthday?

34:49.233 --> 34:51.567
- She hasn't called me, no.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.333
- Yeah, but, obviously,
your birthday

34:53.367 --> 34:56.433
is your mother's day too,
and I love that.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.600
Jax can be a complete asshole,

34:58.633 --> 35:02.333
but on your birthday, you need
to hear from your mummy,

35:02.367 --> 35:03.700
and I feel sad for him.

35:03.734 --> 35:07.266
- Remember when you came in
with the bus driver?

35:07.300 --> 35:09.367
Here's my 12-year-old's
first experience

35:09.400 --> 35:10.567
with hitting on an older woman.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.467
- Oh!

35:12.500 --> 35:14.734
- The only good qualities
you have

35:14.767 --> 35:16.567
I think you clearly
get from your mother.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.700
- But I just want to say
congratulations.

35:17.734 --> 35:19.300
I won't keep you.
- Okay.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.000
- I don't want
to get emotional.

35:21.033 --> 35:22.300
- Well, happy birthday.
- Okay, thank you, thank you.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.700
Congratulations.

35:34.033 --> 35:36.333
- How you guys doing?
Hi!

35:36.367 --> 35:37.600
- Are you happy?
- I'm loving it.

35:37.633 --> 35:39.367
- Okay, good.

35:41.033 --> 35:42.600
- Okay, good.

35:42.633 --> 35:44.300
- Hey, what's up, man?

35:44.333 --> 35:45.300
- What's up, dude?
- Dude, you all right?

35:45.333 --> 35:46.600
- Yeah, I'm great, man.

35:46.633 --> 35:48.200
- Everything's good,
but we ran out of aquafaba.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.333
I knew we were gonna
run out of aquafaba.

35:49.367 --> 35:50.367
We didn't make nearly enough.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.233
- Yeah.
- Do we need it?

35:52.266 --> 35:53.734
We need it.
It's our first night.

35:53.767 --> 35:57.767
Aquafaba is just a vegan
egg white substitute.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.700
You just use, like,
the viscous liquid

35:59.734 --> 36:01.467
that's in a chickpea can.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.767
- Here, split this with me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.467
I'm gonna run across
to Pavilions and grab it.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.633
And it works
just as good as egg whites.

36:07.667 --> 36:08.633
All right,
I'll be back in ten minutes.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.333
- These are for the clients.

36:10.367 --> 36:11.567
Don't worry, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.567
You need cash?
- No, no, I got it.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.567
Maybe not as silky.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.667
It's pretty silky.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.734
Oh, what's up, dude?
I got aquafaba.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.567
I got aquafaba.
Whoo!

36:26.600 --> 36:31.233
All right, got a situation
down there.

36:31.266 --> 36:32.333
Hey, James.

36:32.367 --> 36:33.633
You mind helping me

36:33.667 --> 36:35.500
open these bad boys
for a little bit?

36:35.533 --> 36:37.400
- You got to find a distributor
to just buy this from.

36:37.433 --> 36:39.433
- Ah, sh--.

36:39.467 --> 36:41.367
This is so tedious.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.633
Aquafaba, it was a mistake.

36:52.033 --> 36:53.500
- Hi, Lisa.

36:53.533 --> 36:55.533
- Hello, darling.

36:55.567 --> 36:59.000
- Lisa, are you smashed?

36:59.033 --> 37:00.567
- No, not at all.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.400
You don't realize--
why are they so strong?

37:04.433 --> 37:06.567
Yeah, they were pink--
oh, the pink one.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.300
I'm a bit drunk.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.066
- Lisa, did you have
a good time?

37:15.100 --> 37:16.533
- I did.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.667
- You did.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.400
Look at how cute.

37:19.433 --> 37:20.667
- You sure as hell have earned
it. I'll say that again.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.533
- You looked so cute
when you said that.

37:22.567 --> 37:25.533
Lisa being drunk right now
is such a huge compliment.

37:25.567 --> 37:27.734
She feels Schwartz
and I are capable

37:27.767 --> 37:30.767
of handling this environment
enough for her to get drunk.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.033
- Lisa, I just want to say
I love you.

37:33.066 --> 37:35.333
Not in a--I have
so much respect for you.

37:35.367 --> 37:37.066
I don't want to get
too sentimental.

37:37.100 --> 37:39.066
I mean, I just--I'm so happy
to be part of your world.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.667
You're a huge inspiration
to us.

37:40.700 --> 37:43.033
- I'm so happy for Tom and Tom

37:43.066 --> 37:45.133
because everything's
come to fruition

37:45.166 --> 37:46.734
and they're really
embracing it

37:46.767 --> 37:49.734
and this is exactly the vision
that I had for them.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.767
This is a starting point
for you guys,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
starting point
for you to jump off.

37:55.033 --> 37:58.000
However, we've got to get
the gas turned on.

37:58.033 --> 37:59.734
We've got to train the staff,
get the kitchen running.

37:59.767 --> 38:01.433
We've got to order the food.

38:01.467 --> 38:03.300
We've got to get
everything together,

38:03.333 --> 38:05.700
and that's gonna be
a lot of hard work.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.467
- I know, I know.
- We know.

38:11.700 --> 38:15.000
You give me anything less
than 100%--

38:15.033 --> 38:17.400
- You're gonna get 5% each.

38:31.467 --> 38:33.033
- I'm behind you,
right behind you.

38:33.066 --> 38:34.033
Behind you.

38:34.066 --> 38:36.533
All right, I got napkins.

38:36.567 --> 38:37.600
Here we go.
Here we go.

38:37.633 --> 38:38.600
I'm putting them down here.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.600
They're right here.

38:39.633 --> 38:40.600
Right here to the left.

38:40.633 --> 38:41.633
And I got glasses.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.367
- Dude, this is crazy.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.700
Look at where
we are right now.

38:48.734 --> 38:50.100
We have two friends
that just opened...

38:50.133 --> 38:52.533
- A ----ing bar
with Lisa Vanderpump,

38:52.567 --> 38:55.000
and it looks incredible.

38:55.033 --> 38:58.166
- They have their names on
a building in West Hollywood.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.467
- I know.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.633
- Life is really good.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.200
- What the (BLEEP)
is happening?

39:02.233 --> 39:04.166
What's going on?
I'm 30.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.667
We're going
on a girls' trip.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.400
I'm going to Solvang.
We're going wine tasting.

39:07.433 --> 39:08.767
There are all these ----ing
things that are going on.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.533
I love girls' trips.

39:10.567 --> 39:11.600
I love girl time.

39:11.633 --> 39:13.166
Girl time makes me so happy.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.166
- The best time ever.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.166
- This is the best
group of friends

39:16.200 --> 39:18.433
in the whole ----ing world.

39:18.467 --> 39:23.533
We are all the most ----ed up
but awesomely great

39:23.567 --> 39:27.433
best group of friends.
- Right?

39:27.467 --> 39:29.033
- I'm gonna go watch TV.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.133
- Let me know
if you need anything.

39:31.166 --> 39:35.700
Go make Mama feel better.

39:35.734 --> 39:37.066
Bobo, go and make
Mama feel better.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.600
Go help Mama.
Go get her.

39:39.633 --> 39:42.500
- You want to hang out with me?

39:42.533 --> 39:46.166
You want to hang out with me?

39:46.200 --> 39:48.000
At least someone likes me.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.567
- What's up?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.100
- Coming in here
looking for some food.

40:03.133 --> 40:04.467
- We got you, baby.
- What you guys going on?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.200
- What you want?
- It's hot in here.

40:06.233 --> 40:07.633
- You want a burger,
a chicken sandwich?

40:07.667 --> 40:08.700
- What's this?

40:08.734 --> 40:10.200
This is where you're DJing?

40:10.233 --> 40:11.734
- Dude.
- Are you in a closet?

40:11.767 --> 40:14.166
- Yes.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.000
- There's so many things
I could say right now

40:16.033 --> 40:17.533
that I'm not gonna say
'cause I'm a nice guy.

40:17.567 --> 40:19.667
- Ah, don't worry,
I already know.

40:19.700 --> 40:23.066
I'm a smart lad.
I can only imagine.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.300
And I've run out.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.233
Every other song,
I've run out.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.467
- Get you a drink?

40:32.500 --> 40:34.667
I'll be a nice guy.
Can I get you a drink?

40:34.700 --> 40:36.300
- I'm good.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.734
- Seeing James DJ here
in the back room of TomTom

40:38.767 --> 40:42.066
on opening night
in a sweaty little office

40:42.100 --> 40:44.700
is, like, the best birthday
present you could imagine.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.133
I'll get you a cocktail...
- I'm not drinking.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.066
- Okay.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.100
- ♪ What you see ♪

40:51.133 --> 40:53.667
♪ What you see ♪

40:53.700 --> 40:55.734
♪ Heaven on Earth, baby ♪

40:55.767 --> 40:57.300
- Lookit, lookit, lookit.

40:57.333 --> 40:58.600
- I haven't seen
the sign at night.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.200
- You want to step back here.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.633
Look at it.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.266
Oh, TT, that's you.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.200
I love you.
- I love you too.

41:05.233 --> 41:07.000
- I can't wait to hang out
here every day.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.667
- I know,
I love it so much.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.700
- I'm so proud of you.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

41:10.734 --> 41:12.100
- I'm so proud of you.
- Let's go get a drink.

41:12.133 --> 41:13.567
I haven't had any drinks.

41:15.033 --> 41:17.633
- Whoo!

41:17.667 --> 41:19.000
- How you doing?

41:19.033 --> 41:21.300
- How are you doing,
more importantly?

41:21.333 --> 41:23.500
- Doing great.

41:23.533 --> 41:26.633
- Tom, this place
looks unbelievable.

41:26.667 --> 41:30.166
I have known Tom
for almost eight years,

41:30.200 --> 41:33.633
and I feel like even
when we were broke

41:33.667 --> 41:36.033
behind the bar
at Villa Blanca,

41:36.066 --> 41:37.333
I remember him talking about

41:37.367 --> 41:38.633
how he wanted to
own a bar one day.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.300
- This is called the Hot Pink.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.633
It's very spicy, so be careful.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.133
- I love that.

41:46.767 --> 41:51.233
- This is a dream of his
and he's fulfilling that

41:51.266 --> 41:54.233
and this is a huge,
giant step forward.

41:54.266 --> 41:57.200
- Ariana, there's two of the
most happiest years of my life:

41:57.233 --> 41:59.600
2014, the year
we first started dating,

41:59.633 --> 42:01.200
and this year.

42:01.233 --> 42:04.166
- What's gonna happen
when it actually opens?

42:04.200 --> 42:05.533
Then what?

42:05.567 --> 42:07.367
- It's gonna be even better.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.700
It's gonna be even better.

42:12.233 --> 42:15.033
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:15.066 --> 42:16.233
- It was a success.

42:16.266 --> 42:18.033
- But let's just
take a breath, right?

42:18.066 --> 42:20.667
There's still a lot of things
that need to be done.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.767
This is where
the hard work begins.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.200
- Oh, my effing God.

42:29.233 --> 42:31.000
I'm on a private jet.

42:31.033 --> 42:34.133
- We're on the PJ, bitches,
and none of us paid for it!

42:35.367 --> 42:37.300
- Yeah, oh, sh--.
- Oh, sh--.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.233
- He's done a lot better, but,
like, sometimes if we ever have

42:39.266 --> 42:41.033
to bring up our past, he's,
like, super shut off about it.

42:41.066 --> 42:42.667
- You're telling her,
basically, shut up.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.033
- I don't want
to talk about it.

42:44.066 --> 42:45.600
- So this is Merlot.

42:45.633 --> 42:47.367
- I think Merlot
is the basic bitch of wine.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.633
- Okay, um...

42:49.667 --> 42:51.266
- Crazy Kristen,
she's not coming.

42:51.300 --> 42:52.400
She's here.

42:52.433 --> 42:54.233
- He's your ex-husband!

42:54.266 --> 42:55.767
He's my father!

42:56.000 --> 42:57.166
You can't talk to me about Dad.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.667
- Was I a sh-- mother?

42:58.700 --> 43:01.233
You took your first steps
at ----ing Tiffany's.

43:02.667 --> 43:06.100
