We only have till sunrise.

10:39.594 --> 10:44.394
How do you wanna
spend the time?

10:46.734 --> 10:48.034
[barks and whimpers]

10:48.101 --> 10:50.804
[laughs] Okay, okay, boy.

10:50.870 --> 10:52.440
-[Brucely barks]
-Wow.

10:52.506 --> 10:54.808
Things progress fast
around here.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.644
[gasps]

10:57.711 --> 11:00.514
Oh. Very fast.

11:00.581 --> 11:02.583
Whoa!

11:02.650 --> 11:05.153
[Lex into microphone]
<i>Now, that's an important
</i> <i>development.</i>

11:05.220 --> 11:08.355
<i>And I do believe the target
</i> <i>is important enough to risk</i>

11:08.423 --> 11:10.658
<i>compromising
</i> <i>Ms. Markov's cover.</i>

11:10.724 --> 11:12.125
<i>Send word, Slade.</i>

11:12.192 --> 11:15.643
<i>The Op is a go.</i>

11:19.732 --> 11:22.769
[all grunting]

11:22.836 --> 11:27.240
[groans]

11:27.307 --> 11:31.578
-Let's be on our way.
-[alarm blaring]

11:31.645 --> 11:34.581
[Dubbilex] <i>You have met
</i> <i>all of our "monsters."</i>

11:34.648 --> 11:35.951
Perhaps, Fred,

11:36.018 --> 11:39.820
you are now comfortable
enough to reveal your truth.

11:39.886 --> 11:41.188
Oh, uh, yes.

11:41.254 --> 11:43.457
Fred Bugg is
quite comfortable.

11:43.524 --> 11:46.961
And Forager is most happy
to reveal his truth.

11:47.028 --> 11:49.697
But Forager would also be
most happy to hear the truth

11:49.764 --> 11:52.099
behind the creation
of Geranium City.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.635
I'd be honored to tell you.

11:54.702 --> 11:58.605
But it is more efficient
for Kraig to telepathically
show you.

11:58.672 --> 12:02.775
[chitters]

12:02.842 --> 12:04.578
[Dubbilex] <i>Six years ago,</i>

12:04.645 --> 12:08.850
<i>the original Genomorph City
</i> <i>was under the Cadmus Building</i>

12:08.917 --> 12:13.721
<i>and under the thumb of
</i> <i>Cadmus' founder, Lex Luthor.</i>

12:13.788 --> 12:16.124
<i>But our brother, Conner,
</i> <i>gathered allies</i>

12:16.191 --> 12:21.191
<i>who liberated us from that
</i> <i>place and that servitude.</i>

12:21.361 --> 12:24.798
<i>They brought us
</i> <i>to this place,</i>

12:24.865 --> 12:28.669
<i>so that we could build
</i> <i>a life of our own.</i>

12:28.736 --> 12:33.736
<i>Which is exactly what
</i> <i>we have set out to do.</i>

12:39.013 --> 12:40.414
Using the power of illusion

12:40.480 --> 12:43.751
to hide our true forms
from passing outsiders.

12:43.817 --> 12:47.153
Forager does not believe
Genomorphs need to hide
from the Outsiders.

12:47.221 --> 12:49.256
The Outsiders
are very accepting.

12:49.322 --> 12:51.024
Different Outsiders.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.693
But the point is that
the Genomorphs

12:52.760 --> 12:56.730
have found a place for
themselves in our world.

12:56.797 --> 12:59.133
Yes and no, Brother.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.534
Yes and no.

13:00.601 --> 13:03.136
[Wally] <i>Yes or no?
</i> <i>And be honest.</i>

13:03.203 --> 13:05.106
You really don't miss
the Life at all?

13:05.173 --> 13:08.241
[stutters] I mean, sure,
we both have these cushy gigs
at the University.

13:08.308 --> 13:09.909
I love teaching Physics.

13:09.976 --> 13:11.946
And I love teaching Comp Lit.

13:12.011 --> 13:13.380
Right, exactly.

13:13.447 --> 13:16.850
But, enough to never
put on a mask again?

13:16.917 --> 13:18.219
I think I...

13:18.285 --> 13:21.855
We, have everything
we need right here.

13:21.922 --> 13:24.491
<i>And for my final trick,</i>

13:24.558 --> 13:28.428
<i>I'm going to make
</i> <i>the sun appear.</i>

13:28.495 --> 13:30.730
[clears throat] Let's see
what else is on, okay?

13:30.798 --> 13:32.000
[Raquel]<i>Coming up next,</i>

13:32.067 --> 13:34.469
<i>another whacky episode
</i> <i>of</i> Hello, Megan!

13:34.535 --> 13:36.538
Or maybe that's
enough TV for now.

13:36.604 --> 13:38.839
It's time for the baby's
late night feeding, anyway.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.075
Yeah, it's very late, babe.

13:41.142 --> 13:42.409
Sun'll rise soon.

13:42.476 --> 13:45.212
Let it. I never want to leave.

13:45.278 --> 13:47.514
[Dubbilex]
<i>We are comfortable here,</i>

13:47.581 --> 13:50.518
but the dream
is not yet achieved.

13:50.585 --> 13:53.653
Though safe in Geranium City,

13:53.721 --> 13:55.456
we are segregated.

13:55.523 --> 13:57.991
And when not segregated,
we hide,

13:58.058 --> 13:59.693
even in plain sight,

13:59.760 --> 14:02.496
never permitted
to be ourselves.

14:02.563 --> 14:04.899
[clicking tongue]
Forager understands.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.433
This problem is common.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.802
Forager could return to
his hive on New Genesis

14:08.870 --> 14:13.870
and safely blend in
among the other drones.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.410
But at least, on Earth,

14:16.476 --> 14:18.846
the prejudices
are being faced.

14:18.913 --> 14:20.714
What are you...

14:20.780 --> 14:22.015
[chitters]

14:22.082 --> 14:23.551
[clicks tongue]

14:23.618 --> 14:27.355
Forager will remain here,
on the front lines.

14:27.422 --> 14:29.356
Forager will join
the Outsiders

14:29.423 --> 14:30.957
and fight the good fight

14:31.024 --> 14:32.460
where the entire Earth Hive

14:32.527 --> 14:36.397
may see that
Forager is Forager.

14:36.464 --> 14:39.667
And perhaps Forager's openness
will help the Geraniums.

14:39.734 --> 14:43.037
That is admirable,
my new friend.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.105
Will you do as much?

14:45.172 --> 14:47.142
-Excuse me?
-You, brother,

14:47.208 --> 14:50.844
were freed from Cadmus to
lead us to the promised land.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.913
But still you hide,

14:52.980 --> 14:55.216
which keeps us in hiding,

14:55.283 --> 14:56.817
at a time when
all meta-humans,

14:56.884 --> 14:59.486
including Genomorphs,
struggle for acceptance.

14:59.553 --> 15:02.255
You know you can do
more to help.

15:02.322 --> 15:04.357
Conner Kent
has helped Forager.

15:04.424 --> 15:06.394
[stutters] And Brion,
and Violet,

15:06.461 --> 15:08.296
and Victor and Tara.

15:08.361 --> 15:09.831
[Dubbilex] Yes,

15:09.898 --> 15:12.832
our brother has always been
good at collecting strays.

15:12.899 --> 15:14.000
[Wolf whines]

15:14.067 --> 15:15.971
At helping individuals,

15:16.037 --> 15:19.373
because he sees himself
as an individual.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.142
Alone. Apart.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.610
[growls]

15:22.677 --> 15:25.312
But when will you acknowledge
your own place?

15:25.379 --> 15:27.881
Your own role in
the connected world?

15:27.948 --> 15:30.283
When will you take
the final step

15:30.350 --> 15:33.153
to help your own people?

15:33.220 --> 15:35.956
Ask yourself, brother.

15:36.023 --> 15:39.259
What would Superman do?

15:39.326 --> 15:41.796
[Forager stutters] Apologies.

15:41.863 --> 15:44.764
Um, but Forager will need
Fred Bugg one more time.

15:44.831 --> 15:45.865
[knock on door]

15:45.932 --> 15:48.903
[barking]

15:48.970 --> 15:51.272
Hi. We just
wanted to stop by--

15:51.339 --> 15:53.140
To see the baby.
I understand.

15:53.207 --> 15:56.376
But I hope you understand
why I need to be selfish
right now

15:56.443 --> 15:59.480
and not share
our little family.

15:59.547 --> 16:03.417
Well, uh,
that's the problem, babe.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.485
What do you see?

16:04.552 --> 16:06.354
It's getting lighter.

16:06.419 --> 16:07.989
The sun's about to rise.

16:08.056 --> 16:10.758
I think it's going to be
a beautiful morning.

16:10.825 --> 16:14.094
Sure. But what else
do you see?

16:14.160 --> 16:15.562
I...

16:15.629 --> 16:19.232
I see everything
I need right here.

16:19.299 --> 16:20.234
I get it.

16:20.301 --> 16:22.336
That's one beautiful baby.

16:22.403 --> 16:23.736
Is it a boy or a girl?

16:23.803 --> 16:25.038
[scoffs] What?

16:25.105 --> 16:26.340
What's the baby's name?

16:26.407 --> 16:28.475
[stutters] I... We...

16:28.543 --> 16:31.245
-We haven't named it yet.
-It?

16:31.312 --> 16:34.249
No. We talked a little about
having an "it" one day,

16:34.316 --> 16:38.519
but we could never agree
on a name for a boy or a girl.

16:38.586 --> 16:39.986
I still like Wolf,
by the way.

16:40.053 --> 16:41.187
Wolf West, just so you know.

16:41.254 --> 16:42.690
[chuckles] For the last time,

16:42.756 --> 16:45.725
we are not naming our child
after Conner's dog.

16:45.793 --> 16:47.695
What child?

16:47.761 --> 16:49.129
Where... [breathing heavily]

16:49.196 --> 16:51.197
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!

16:51.264 --> 16:54.264
-[barking]
-Brucely!

16:59.706 --> 17:02.076
[Wally] Open the door,
Artemis.

17:02.143 --> 17:03.979
Let people in again.

17:04.045 --> 17:06.448
Or better yet,
walk through it yourself.

17:06.515 --> 17:08.983
You've made a good start
by helping Violet,
Tara and the rest.

17:09.049 --> 17:12.219
But, you haven't let
anyone help you.

17:12.286 --> 17:13.721
[sobbing] Please.

17:13.788 --> 17:16.590
Please. Please.
Please, hold on. Hold on.

17:16.657 --> 17:19.661
I can't, babe.
Believe me, I want to.

17:19.727 --> 17:21.762
But I love you too much.

17:21.829 --> 17:24.265
I won't let you
throw your life away

17:24.332 --> 17:25.700
on a memory of what was

17:25.767 --> 17:28.536
or even on a dream of
what might have been.

17:28.603 --> 17:31.571
There's a real life for you
beyond this door.

17:31.638 --> 17:33.240
A chance at real love.

17:33.307 --> 17:36.277
[sniffles] No,
I had my chance.

17:36.344 --> 17:37.811
You'll get another.

17:37.878 --> 17:41.915
So, this very morning,
I want you to stop mourning.

17:41.982 --> 17:45.153
I want you to live
your life and find love.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.788
I'm not sure who could
possibly deserve you.

17:47.855 --> 17:51.358
But I trust you to make
the right choice.

17:51.424 --> 17:53.294
After all, babe,
you must have good taste.

17:53.361 --> 17:55.929
-You picked me.
-[chuckles]

17:55.996 --> 17:57.765
[sniffles] I'm...

17:57.832 --> 18:00.300
I'm not sorry
that I came here.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.070
Hey, me neither.

18:03.137 --> 18:06.173
We needed this night
to finally say goodbye.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.942
But the night's ending,

18:08.009 --> 18:10.478
and it's time for
my Spitfire to go home

18:10.545 --> 18:11.894
and live.

18:16.483 --> 18:20.787
[sighs]

18:20.854 --> 18:22.054
[kisses]

18:50.150 --> 18:52.385
[chuckles]

18:52.452 --> 18:53.721
[sighs]

18:53.788 --> 18:55.989
The Spirits have
done it all in one night.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.358
[breath trembling]

18:58.425 --> 18:59.826
[Zatanna] Artemis!

18:59.894 --> 19:03.163
[sighs] It's all right.
It's all right. I'm good.

19:03.230 --> 19:05.132
And I'm very grateful, Z.

19:05.199 --> 19:06.967
I got what I needed.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.534
Thank you.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.409
Wow.

19:15.476 --> 19:16.611
I still can't believe
you summoned

19:16.676 --> 19:17.744
Wally's ghost for her.

19:17.811 --> 19:19.381
[softly] I did no such thing.

19:19.448 --> 19:24.448
I told Artemis I didn't have
that power, and I meant it.

19:25.184 --> 19:26.453
Then M'gann!

19:26.519 --> 19:28.422
[Zatanna] M'gann
created a playground,

19:28.489 --> 19:30.590
an open space
in Artemis' mind.

19:30.657 --> 19:32.826
But Artemis created
or imagined

19:32.894 --> 19:35.429
everything she saw
and experienced.

19:35.496 --> 19:38.900
My legerdemain
and M'gann's telepathy

19:38.967 --> 19:42.435
gave her the chance to
work things out for herself.

19:42.502 --> 19:44.270
We'll tell her someday.

19:44.337 --> 19:48.875
<i>Or, maybe we won't.</i>

19:48.942 --> 19:53.942
-[dishes clinking]
-[water running]

19:54.281 --> 19:55.682
-[whispering] How'd it go?
-[door closes]

19:55.750 --> 19:57.417
-It...
-[snoring]

19:57.484 --> 20:00.186
Was a pretty average night.

20:00.253 --> 20:01.454
I'll put her to bed now.

20:01.521 --> 20:03.771
Thanks. [sighs]

20:06.861 --> 20:09.096
Artemis, I'm so sorry.

20:09.163 --> 20:10.431
-I... I didn't mean--
-[door closes]

20:10.498 --> 20:12.465
No, Will, please.

20:12.532 --> 20:14.867
You didn't do anything wrong.

20:14.934 --> 20:16.202
In fact,

20:16.269 --> 20:18.105
I'm grateful to you.

20:18.172 --> 20:20.540
You've helped me open up,

20:20.607 --> 20:22.676
take the next step.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.011
And I want you to know,

20:24.078 --> 20:27.114
I will always be there
for you and Lian.

20:27.181 --> 20:28.548
But...

20:28.615 --> 20:31.451
But, I'm sorry.

20:31.519 --> 20:33.820
We are not right
for each other.

20:33.887 --> 20:35.455
Phew... [chuckles nervously]

20:35.522 --> 20:36.857
What a relief.

20:36.924 --> 20:38.558
I... I felt it, too,
as soon as we kissed.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.694
I... I mean,
it's just too weird, right?

20:40.761 --> 20:42.195
-[laughs]
-You're my sister-in-law!

20:42.262 --> 20:44.498
I know!

20:44.565 --> 20:45.866
Friends?

20:45.933 --> 20:48.935
Friends. And family.

20:49.001 --> 20:51.806
Always.

20:51.873 --> 20:54.407
I'll, um, see you
in the morning?

20:54.474 --> 20:57.344
I'll have the coffee brewing.

20:57.411 --> 20:59.313
[chuckles] Come on, Brucely.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.981

21:19.467 --> 21:20.768
<i>and staged a coup</i>

21:20.835 --> 21:22.202
<i>with the help of meta-humans</i>

21:22.269 --> 21:24.239
<i>and members of
</i> <i>the military loyal to him.</i>

21:24.306 --> 21:26.707
<i>No word yet on the status

21:26.773 --> 21:28.343
<i>of King Gregor Markov.</i>

21:28.410 --> 21:30.111
[stutters] <i>Excuse me.
</i> <i>This just in.</i>

21:30.178 --> 21:33.314
<i>Baron DeLamb has released
</i> <i>a video statement.</i>

21:33.380 --> 21:34.548
<i>Good morning.</i>

21:34.615 --> 21:36.549
<i>I have a short statement.</i>

21:36.616 --> 21:39.019
<i>I, Baron Frederick DeLamb,</i>

21:39.086 --> 21:41.387
<i>have taken
</i> <i>the Markovian Crown</i>

21:41.454 --> 21:43.124
<i>for the good of my nation</i>

21:43.191 --> 21:45.393
<i>in order to save it
</i> <i>from the weak rule</i>

21:45.460 --> 21:48.296
<i>of my misguided nephew,
</i> <i>Prince Gregor.</i>

21:48.363 --> 21:50.097
<i>United Nations
</i> <i>Secretary General</i>

21:50.164 --> 21:52.232
<i>Lex Luthor had this to say.</i>

21:52.299 --> 21:54.836
<i>No, we will not lift
</i> <i>U.N. restrictions</i>

21:54.902 --> 21:57.872
that prevent the Justice League
<i>from entering Markovia.</i>

21:57.939 --> 21:59.508
<i>This is an internal matter.</i>

21:59.574 --> 22:02.175
<i>And there are good people
</i> <i>on both sides.</i>

22:02.241 --> 22:03.545
<i>Both sides.</i>

22:03.612 --> 22:06.279
<i>The solution involves
</i> <i>peaceful negotiation,</i>

22:06.346 --> 22:08.082
<i>not super-heroics.</i>

22:08.148 --> 22:10.651
They must have known
I was out of the country!

22:10.718 --> 22:12.586
-But how?
-Does that matter now?

22:12.653 --> 22:13.988
No, no, of course not.

22:14.055 --> 22:16.423
What matters is that I
return home immediately.

22:16.490 --> 22:18.893
Brion, you can't let him.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.229
They'll kill him the moment
he sets foot in Markovia.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.564
[Gregor] There is
no other option.

22:23.631 --> 22:24.999
You're wrong.

22:25.066 --> 22:27.234
Though the Justice League
may not intervene,

22:27.301 --> 22:29.936
my squad doesn't face
those restrictions.

22:30.003 --> 22:32.440
This is what I've been
preparing for.

22:32.507 --> 22:36.276
I cannot hide in
a Beverly Hills hotel room.

22:36.343 --> 22:37.845
Be patient, brother.

22:37.912 --> 22:39.913
We tried things your way.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.615
Now we try them mine.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.784
Geo-Force will lead
the Outsiders

22:43.851 --> 22:46.286
to save our homeland.

22:46.353 --> 22:49.803
Markovia, here we come.
