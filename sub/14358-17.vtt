<i>Out here in the middle,</i>

00:07.775 --> 00:09.654
<i>we have a proud history
of lending a helping hand,</i>

00:09.655 --> 00:12.752
<i>chipping in and doing what
we can for the common good...</i>

00:12.753 --> 00:15.681
<i>We who don't have three kids
and a job, that is.</i>

00:15.682 --> 00:17.745
<i>That's why at our house,</i>

00:17.746 --> 00:21.190
<i>we have what I like to call
my sucker list,</i>

00:21.191 --> 00:23.157
<i>'cause only a sucker
would answer a call</i>

00:23.158 --> 00:24.659
<i>from any of these people,</i>

00:24.660 --> 00:26.959
Jessica Kirkwood,
auction chairwoman?

00:26.960 --> 00:29.163
Let it ring.

00:29.164 --> 00:31.503
Reverend Hayver,
church rummage sale.

00:31.504 --> 00:33.104
Let it ring.

00:33.105 --> 00:36.039
<i>Unfortunately, Mike lives
in an old-fashioned world...</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:38.108
<i>The phone rings,
you answer it.</i>

00:38.109 --> 00:39.744
Hello? Hi, Sally.

00:39.745 --> 00:42.547
<i>Sally Meenahan, hospitality mom.</i>

00:42.548 --> 00:44.549
Yeah, of course
we'll be at Axl's game.

00:44.550 --> 00:47.154
Best season
in a long while, huh?

00:47.155 --> 00:49.720
Run the snack bar? Ell,
Frankie's gonna be there anyway.

00:49.721 --> 00:52.758
I don't see any reason she can't do it.
Oh. I...

00:52.759 --> 00:56.462
Okeydoke. Bye, Sally. She wants
you to work the snack bar.

00:56.463 --> 00:58.097
Yeah, I got that.

00:58.098 --> 01:00.665
Sucker list, Mike.

01:00.666 --> 01:02.133
Sucker list.

01:02.134 --> 01:03.569
Are you blind?

01:03.570 --> 01:07.072
I was gesturing wildly enough
to land a plane.

01:07.073 --> 01:09.040
Consider this payback
for the time

01:09.041 --> 01:12.076
that you volunteered me to take
the aunts to see Mac Davis.

01:19.548 --> 01:22.716
Hey. You can't stack 'em
that way.

01:22.717 --> 01:26.819
<i>The new snack bar supervisor has
crazy high standards. Oh.</i>

01:26.820 --> 01:30.021
Oh, my gosh.
Here she comes. Look busy.

01:30.022 --> 01:31.488
Okay, team snack bar!

01:31.489 --> 01:34.192
For those of you that
don't know me, I'm Morgan.

01:34.193 --> 01:36.461
I promised the junior achievers

01:36.462 --> 01:38.830
that I'd finally make
this snack bar profitable,

01:38.831 --> 01:41.166
<i>and that is going to happen!</i>

01:41.167 --> 01:43.168
Every dollar we earn
is another step towards

01:43.169 --> 01:46.505
putting doors on the bathroom
stalls. We can do this, right?

01:46.506 --> 01:48.440
Right!
Right.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.510
I can't hear you! Right?
Right.

01:54.313 --> 01:56.615
<i>So while I was
in snack bar hell,</i>

01:56.616 --> 01:59.584
<i>sue was in a hell of her own
babysitting Brick.</i>

01:59.585 --> 02:02.285
What are you watching?
"Revenge of the Pod Zombies. "

02:02.286 --> 02:05.888
It's too scary for you. Go to bed.
If you've moved up to a level

02:05.889 --> 02:08.824
where you can babysit me
at night, then I've moved up

02:08.824 --> 02:11.893
to a level where I can stay up
and a scary movie.

02:11.894 --> 02:14.396
I have to call mom and dad
and see if it's okay.

02:14.397 --> 02:16.298
If you have
to call mom and dad,

02:16.299 --> 02:18.967
maybe you're not mature enough
to babysit me at all.

02:18.968 --> 02:20.369
Mature.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.537
Fine. Ten minutes.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.575
So catch me up.

02:26.576 --> 02:28.176
These zombies...

02:28.177 --> 02:30.111
Why are they seeking revenge?

02:30.112 --> 02:31.979
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

02:31.980 --> 02:34.548
I love watching
my boyfriend warm up.

02:34.549 --> 02:36.450
Oh. Which one is he?

02:36.451 --> 02:39.920
Oh, there, he cute one
with the dark hair... number 23.

02:39.921 --> 02:41.789
Wait. Uh,

02:41.790 --> 02:43.223
that's your boyfriend?

02:43.224 --> 02:46.326
The... that one there
with the hair in his eyes?

02:46.327 --> 02:47.760
Oh.

02:47.761 --> 02:48.828
Since when?

02:48.829 --> 02:50.763
Six weeks next Wednesday.

02:50.764 --> 02:52.731
Six weeks?

02:52.732 --> 02:54.666
Wow. Well,
that's... that's plenty of time

02:54.667 --> 02:57.970
to, uh, you know,
meet the parents and everything.

02:57.971 --> 02:59.538
Oh, they're dead,

02:59.539 --> 03:04.010
which is okay, 'cause he said
they were really lame.

03:04.011 --> 03:06.880
I'm just messing with you,
Mrs. Heck. I know who you are.

03:06.881 --> 03:09.483
Oh. You do?
Totally! Hi!

03:09.484 --> 03:12.453
Hi. I actually wanted to
meet you a while ago,

03:12.454 --> 03:15.723
but you know how Axl is.
No, I-I don't. Tell me.

03:15.724 --> 03:18.593
Oh, you know, he's just shy in
that really adorable way of his.

03:18.594 --> 03:21.496
But once you get to know him,
he's so hilarious.

03:21.497 --> 03:24.032
Axl Heck, number 23?

03:24.033 --> 03:26.368
Oh, and every day he leaves
a note in my locker

03:26.369 --> 03:29.304
telling me another reason
he loves me.

03:29.305 --> 03:31.273
<i>Axl's been in love
for six weeks?</i>

03:31.274 --> 03:34.610
<i>In retrospect,
i guess there were signs.</i>

03:38.716 --> 03:42.819
Mom, what rhymes
with "tenderly"?

03:42.820 --> 03:44.989
Mom, I think I'm in love.

03:44.990 --> 03:48.392
Shh! No talking
during the McDreamy scenes.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.962
Time to form
a Cheer-A-Mid!

03:51.963 --> 03:54.998
It was so great finally meeting you, Mrs.
Heck. You, too.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.833
Bye.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.669
Hey.

04:04.508 --> 04:07.009
Call me.

04:09.045 --> 04:10.678
<i>Six weeks.</i>

04:10.679 --> 04:13.014
Her name's Morgan.

04:13.015 --> 04:15.951
I'm gonna snoop out some more
information from the other moms.

04:15.952 --> 04:18.754
You work the stands and see
if the dads know anything.

04:18.755 --> 04:22.023
Who am I kidding? They won't.
Oh, my God, Mike.

04:22.024 --> 04:24.860
Can you believe it?

04:24.861 --> 04:28.096
Our little boy's in love.

04:28.097 --> 04:30.098
<i>Aah!
This is too scary.</i>

04:30.099 --> 04:32.334
I- I think
we should turn it off.

04:32.335 --> 04:34.236
No. If we turn it off now,

04:34.237 --> 04:37.906
<i>we won't get to the happy ending part.
Aah!</i>

04:37.907 --> 04:40.441
There is no happy ending part!

04:43.925 --> 04:46.159
So apparently, along with
being head cheerleader,

04:47.039 --> 04:49.107
she's, like, on a zillion
student committees,

04:49.108 --> 04:50.608
gets straight a's

04:50.609 --> 04:52.977
and founded the young
hoosier honor society. Wow.

04:54.446 --> 04:57.749
Yeah. But still, they've been
dating for six weeks,

04:57.750 --> 05:00.651
and this is the first
we hear of her?

05:00.652 --> 05:03.820
I don't know
if I trust this girl.

05:03.821 --> 05:05.755
Hi, Mrs. Heck.

05:05.756 --> 05:07.823
- Hey, Morgan.
- Now that we've officially met

05:07.824 --> 05:10.459
and my relationship with Axl
is out in the open,

05:10.460 --> 05:13.228
I realize the awkward position
we've put you in

05:13.229 --> 05:15.263
by not telling you
about our relationship.

05:15.264 --> 05:17.498
I'm sure you have
a ton of questions.

05:17.499 --> 05:19.566
Well, actually, I do.
Come on in.

05:21.336 --> 05:23.971
For starters,
we're not having sex.

05:23.972 --> 05:26.573
That's something
I think we should wait for,

05:26.574 --> 05:27.908
at least until college.

05:27.909 --> 05:29.943
We're young. We have to build
a solid foundation

05:29.944 --> 05:33.213
<i>before even thinking about doing stuff like that.
I love her.</i>

05:33.214 --> 05:35.516
Hi, Mr. Heck. Morgan.
Hi.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.418
We didn't get to meet yesterday,

05:37.419 --> 05:40.220
but I brought you some muffins I made.
Thanks.

05:40.221 --> 05:42.256
Are these blueberry
or boysenberry?

05:42.257 --> 05:44.358
Both.

05:46.795 --> 05:48.629
I'll go wake Axl.

05:48.630 --> 05:50.665
Oh, actually, could I do it?

05:50.666 --> 05:54.235
I really want to see his sleepy
face. I bet it's really cute.

05:54.236 --> 05:57.105
Oh. Don't worry.
I'll just knock on the door.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.541
It wouldn't be appropriate to go into his room.
End of the hall.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.076
<i>I love her.</i>

06:02.077 --> 06:04.078
I love her more.

06:04.079 --> 06:06.414
There's one thing that's
kinda bugging me, though.

06:06.415 --> 06:08.249
What's she doing with Axl?

06:08.250 --> 06:10.651
Right? I mean,
it's weird, right?

06:10.652 --> 06:13.854
I... look, is that bad for me
to say? I mean, I adore him.

06:13.855 --> 06:15.322
No, I know.

06:15.323 --> 06:17.291
It's just that she's so...
Going places,

06:17.292 --> 06:19.627
and doesn't seem
to want to go anywhere.

06:19.628 --> 06:20.928
Heck curse.

06:20.929 --> 06:22.931
We're irresistible,
and we have a gift

06:22.932 --> 06:26.635
for luring in women who are
clearly out of our league.

06:36.948 --> 06:38.615
Aah!
Aah!

06:38.616 --> 06:40.184
What are you doing?

06:40.185 --> 06:42.052
I was too scared to sleep,

06:42.053 --> 06:44.521
and is is
the only room in the house

06:44.522 --> 06:46.489
where I got to keep
the lights on all night.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.424
I couldn't sleep either.

06:48.425 --> 06:50.359
Every time I closed my eyes,

06:50.360 --> 06:52.827
I saw zombies ripping the guts
out of Taylor Lautner!

06:52.828 --> 06:54.863
Maybe we should tell mom
we saw the movie.

06:54.864 --> 06:58.099
No, you can't tell mom! She'll
think I'm a bad babysitter.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.269
You are a bad babysitter!

07:00.270 --> 07:03.772
You let me watch a scary movie
I am too young for.

07:03.773 --> 07:06.542
Besides, mom always makes it
better when I'm scared.

07:06.543 --> 07:09.344
Did the mom in the zombie movie
make it better?

07:09.345 --> 07:11.980
No.
She ate her baby's face off.

07:15.118 --> 07:18.687
Hi, guys. Oh, my gosh.
He was so adorable when I woke him up.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.423
Yep, morning's
his most adorable time of day.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.631
Okay, here we go.

07:28.632 --> 07:32.067
<i>What are you doing?
I don't want to watch it again!</i>

07:32.068 --> 07:35.137
Trust me. If we watch it again
during the day,

07:35.138 --> 07:37.005
we'll see how silly it is,

07:37.006 --> 07:39.040
and we'll totally laugh
about it,

07:39.041 --> 07:41.275
and the movie will lose
its power over us.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.680
<i>Aah!
Oh, my God!</i>

07:45.681 --> 07:48.583
I thought those zombies were
eating hamburger last time.

07:48.584 --> 07:51.086
They're really eating
that nun's liver!

07:51.087 --> 07:54.557
I just realized zombieism is
just cannibalism in virus form.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.225
This can actually happen!

07:56.226 --> 07:57.727
Aah!

07:57.728 --> 07:59.762
<i>While my two kids
who were usually happy</i>

07:59.763 --> 08:03.999
<i>were unhappy, my one kid
who was never happy was.</i>

08:10.773 --> 08:14.241
<i>He'd had girlfriends before,
but this was something special.</i>

08:14.242 --> 08:18.045
The last seven weeks
and two days have been so great.

08:18.046 --> 08:19.846
I know, right?

08:19.847 --> 08:22.216
But I don't think
we should go out anymore.

08:22.217 --> 08:25.519
You want to just sit in the car
and explore our bodies?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.654
Axl, what I'm saying is...

08:27.655 --> 08:30.090
I think we should break up.

08:30.091 --> 08:32.025
Wh-what?

08:33.928 --> 08:35.628
Why? What... what did I do?

08:35.629 --> 08:38.331
Nothing. It's just...

08:38.332 --> 08:41.332
I don't know, like last week,
we were at the library,

08:41.333 --> 08:43.235
and I was doing research

08:43.236 --> 08:46.170
and you just kept staring
at that video game magazine.

08:46.171 --> 08:48.706
It had a hologram of a dragon.

08:48.707 --> 08:51.175
Which is cool,
but a whole hour?

08:51.176 --> 08:52.276
I...

08:52.277 --> 08:53.877
Look...

08:53.878 --> 08:55.712
You are really fun.

08:55.713 --> 08:58.281
I just think that I may need

08:58.282 --> 09:02.019
someone a little less fun
and more focused, you know?

09:02.020 --> 09:05.256
But we're, like, in love.

09:08.327 --> 09:11.830
Hey. Is Morgan staying
for dinner?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.634
No.

09:15.635 --> 09:18.471
Aw, that's too bad.
I found a pan in the drawer.

09:18.472 --> 09:20.473
I thought
I'd try cooking something.

09:20.474 --> 09:23.209
You know, we could always order in.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.878
Hey. Hey, what's wrong?

09:25.879 --> 09:28.815
She broke up with me.
What?

09:28.816 --> 09:31.517
Mom, I feel like I'm dying.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.486
Oh. Oh, honey, I know.

09:33.487 --> 09:35.321
I know. Shh.

09:35.322 --> 09:36.790
<i>Oh, God.</i>

09:36.791 --> 09:39.960
<i>I forgot how soft his skin was.</i>

09:39.961 --> 09:41.595
What's up with Axl?

09:41.596 --> 09:43.697
He's crying.

09:43.698 --> 09:46.400
There's only
one logical explanation...

09:46.401 --> 09:48.803
He's become a pod zombie!

09:48.804 --> 09:50.838
Don't be ridiculous.

09:53.075 --> 09:56.945
Okay. That is weird.

09:56.946 --> 09:58.513
Hey.

10:00.149 --> 10:02.116
He what's this?

10:02.117 --> 10:05.353
Or something?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.388
No, I'm fine.
Then why are you crying?

10:07.389 --> 10:09.591
I'm not crying, okay? God!

10:12.862 --> 10:15.697
Way to go, Mike.
We were hugging.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.686
<i>Ever since Mike made him feel
embarrassed about crying,</i>

10:21.687 --> 10:24.056
<i>Axl was emotionally
closed off. Axl.</i>

10:25.516 --> 10:27.483
I want you to know
there is nothing wrong

10:27.484 --> 10:29.652
with a man
showing his feelings.

10:29.653 --> 10:33.855
- You got your hug. Now get off me, okay?
- There's just something I want you to hear.

10:34.991 --> 10:37.126
<i>Frankie, it's me.</i>

10:39.162 --> 10:41.363
<i>You hear that?</i>

10:41.364 --> 10:43.399
<i>It's our song, baby.</i>

10:43.400 --> 10:45.334
<i>It came on the radio and I...</i>

10:45.335 --> 10:47.569
<i>Oh, I had to call you.</i>

10:47.570 --> 10:50.405
<i>Please, Frankie.
Please take me back.</i>

10:50.406 --> 10:52.406
<i>I'm so lost without you.</i>

10:52.407 --> 10:54.308
Oh, God! Is that dad?

10:54.309 --> 10:55.876
Yes. Yes, it is.

10:55.877 --> 10:59.213
He left this on my machine after
we broke up for a few weeks

10:59.214 --> 11:01.147
when we were first dating.

11:01.148 --> 11:03.216
Are you serious?

11:03.217 --> 11:05.685
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª your baby needs
someone to believe in Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

11:05.686 --> 11:09.556
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª I'm gonna hold on loosely,
but I won't let go Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

11:09.557 --> 11:13.160
see? Everyone hurts sometimes,
even your dad.

11:13.161 --> 11:15.129
Dude,
he sounds like such a dork!

11:15.130 --> 11:17.633
<i>Is that how I sounded? God!</i>

11:17.634 --> 11:19.168
Who's the dork?

11:19.169 --> 11:21.670
<i>If you get this before morning,
call my pager.</i>

11:21.671 --> 11:23.606
<i>I'm at the Chi-Chi's
on route 42,</i>

11:23.607 --> 11:25.475
<i>waiting by the pay phone.</i>

11:25.476 --> 11:27.309
<i>The chi-chi's
where we sat in back</i>

11:27.310 --> 11:29.479
<i>and fed each other nachos,
remember?</i>

11:32.015 --> 11:34.183
<i>I love you, Frankie.</i>

11:34.184 --> 11:36.151
<i>I love you so much,
my heart...</i>

11:36.152 --> 11:39.854
<i>Frankie, what are you doing?
Are you nuts?!</i>

11:39.855 --> 11:43.158
Where did you get that?!
What... what even is that?!

11:43.159 --> 11:45.293
I can't believe
that you saved that.

11:45.294 --> 11:48.062
Besides, I don't even think
that's me.

11:48.063 --> 11:50.498
<i>Okay. I gotta go.</i>

11:59.476 --> 12:00.943
Mike.

12:00.944 --> 12:03.580
<i>What is the matter
with you?</i>

12:03.581 --> 12:06.249
What? I think it's sweet.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.151
It's not sweet.
It's not anything.

12:08.152 --> 12:09.585
Give me that tape.

12:09.586 --> 12:11.954
No! I love this tape.

12:11.955 --> 12:15.824
You even made up your own lyrics
to 38 Special for me.

12:15.825 --> 12:19.361
You said I was your angel
from above. Where is that part?

12:19.362 --> 12:22.196
<i>My shirt still smells
like your hair. Aah! La la la la la!</i>

12:22.197 --> 12:24.966
<i>I miss your hair.
I can't hear it.</i>

12:24.967 --> 12:28.703
So you love me. So what?
Stop saying that! Give me the tape!

12:28.704 --> 12:31.172
What, love? You want me
to stop saying "love"?

12:31.173 --> 12:36.711
Ma and you played it
for our son?!

12:36.712 --> 12:38.179
It's embarrassing.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.548
It's embarrassing
that your son knows

12:40.549 --> 12:42.884
that you loved his mother
enough to cry?

12:42.885 --> 12:45.285
That's what's embarrassing you?
Hey, let's pull out

12:45.286 --> 12:47.487
some pictures
of you and your giant perm.

12:47.488 --> 12:49.990
I know they're in here
somewhere.

12:49.991 --> 12:53.059
<i>I
didn't do this to embarrass you.</i>

12:53.060 --> 12:54.994
Axl is going through
a really tough time,

12:54.995 --> 12:57.530
and he's never been
that open with his emotions,

12:57.531 --> 13:01.300
and he just needs to see that
it's okay to cry. But it isn't!

13:01.301 --> 13:04.837
I think that tape
makes that perfectly clear.

13:04.838 --> 13:06.605
<i>Oh, man.</i>

13:06.606 --> 13:09.575
<i>Oh, God!</i>

13:09.576 --> 13:11.144
<i>Frankie!</i>

13:14.466 --> 13:17.335
<i>After days of avoiding Axl</i>

13:17.369 --> 13:19.937
<i>Mike realized
he couldn't do it forever.</i>

13:19.971 --> 13:23.006
Hey.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.974
H- hey.

13:25.008 --> 13:26.842
Not much to eat.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.478
Nope.

13:29.512 --> 13:31.446
So, you know, Axl, uh,

13:31.481 --> 13:33.548
about the thing
you heard the other day...

13:33.549 --> 13:36.484
You mean the tape?
We don't have to give it a name.

13:36.519 --> 13:39.522
I just, uh, thought that I should say... about
the thing you don't have to explain it...

13:39.556 --> 13:42.558
Don't look at me. Just let me
say that for whatever reason,

13:42.593 --> 13:46.129
women love it when men cry.
I- it's why your mom sees

13:46.163 --> 13:48.231
every damn Sean Penn movie
that comes out.

13:48.266 --> 13:50.301
Yeah, she's pretty gay for him.

13:50.335 --> 13:53.271
Yeah, so, you know...

13:53.305 --> 13:54.672
What you heard,

13:54.706 --> 13:58.276
uh, on that thing
that your mom played for you,

13:58.311 --> 14:01.279
kinda got me your mom.

14:01.313 --> 14:03.414
So...

14:04.849 --> 14:07.918
Yeah. I guess so.

14:09.521 --> 14:12.890
I think I see some cheese
back there.

14:12.924 --> 14:14.692
Sweet.

14:17.295 --> 14:18.795
Good talk.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.931
Yep.

14:20.965 --> 14:27.470
Ã¢ÂÂª and the home of the brave Ã¢ÂÂª

14:29.373 --> 14:31.774
Is there nothing she can't do?
God, I miss her.

14:31.808 --> 14:33.742
Ehlert Motors
is proud to sponsor

14:33.776 --> 14:36.245
the Thundering Hen
division playoff

14:36.279 --> 14:40.983
with this very generous donation
of $25!

14:41.018 --> 14:43.620
So when shopping
for your next car,

14:43.654 --> 14:46.056
remember the Ehlert motto...

14:46.090 --> 14:48.258
Who cares?

14:59.304 --> 15:02.005
Yeah!

15:03.474 --> 15:06.375
Whoo!
Oh, this is so close.

15:07.744 --> 15:11.480
Let's go, Team Hens! Whoo!

15:11.514 --> 15:13.848
Axl is on fire!

15:16.719 --> 15:20.690
He keeps looking at Morgan.
Well, he's channeling his heartbreak into his game.

15:20.724 --> 15:23.727
I bowled a 280 the night
you broke up with me.

15:23.761 --> 15:26.830
Sue, I need you to take me
to the bathroom.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.732
I'm not missing the game.

15:28.766 --> 15:31.802
Fine. Stay here alone
with pod mom and dad.

15:31.836 --> 15:34.672
I'm taking Brick to the bathroom.
Okay.

15:36.007 --> 15:38.842
Blue and white!

15:38.877 --> 15:42.712
I'm pretty sure there's a boys'
bathroom around here somewhere.

15:42.747 --> 15:45.748
Oh, here it is.

15:48.285 --> 15:50.919
Brick?

15:50.953 --> 15:53.121
Did you already go in?

16:00.329 --> 16:04.698
No one's allowed
in the east wing after dark.

16:04.733 --> 16:08.235
I'm just waiting for my brother.
He's in the bathroom.

16:08.269 --> 16:10.604
Couldn't be that bathroom.

16:10.639 --> 16:13.974
It's been locked for two days.

16:16.177 --> 16:18.045
Brick?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.453
Way to rebound, son!

16:27.487 --> 16:30.122
Make the shot!
Let's go to state! Come on!

16:47.975 --> 16:50.244
Hey.

16:50.278 --> 16:52.079
Why is he stopping?

16:52.113 --> 16:56.551
Axl, what are you doing?
I'm not afraid of my feelings, Morgan.

16:56.585 --> 16:59.321
I love you,
and I know you still love me.

16:59.355 --> 17:02.424
So I'm not gonna shoot
until you take me back.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.731
Tell me, does this sound like

17:09.766 --> 17:12.567
the actions
of a man not going anywhere?

17:12.601 --> 17:15.737
Axl, get your head
in the game!

17:17.439 --> 17:20.641
Go, you jackass!
I got money on this game.

17:20.675 --> 17:24.712
Axl! Now's not the time!

17:24.747 --> 17:28.249
Brick, where are you?

17:28.284 --> 17:29.951
Brick!

17:29.985 --> 17:32.654
You could always check the basement.

17:48.337 --> 17:50.939
There you are.

17:50.973 --> 17:52.807
You scared me.

17:56.079 --> 17:59.314
Brick?

17:59.349 --> 18:02.051
Oh, my God!

18:02.085 --> 18:03.620
Aah!

18:05.389 --> 18:07.624
<i>Cuidado piso mojado.</i>

18:09.894 --> 18:11.796
Axl!

18:11.830 --> 18:15.533
<i>On the one hand, I was proud
he was showing his feelings.</i>

18:15.567 --> 18:19.770
<i>On the other hand,
if we win this, we go to state!</i>

18:19.805 --> 18:22.539
Axl, there'll be other girls!
Shoot the damn ball!

18:22.573 --> 18:24.641
"I'm gonna hold on loosely,

18:24.676 --> 18:27.711
but I won't let go!"

18:29.380 --> 18:31.782
Tell me you'll hold on, too,

18:31.816 --> 18:34.184
and I'll shoot, and we all win.

18:34.219 --> 18:36.920
'Cause our love is so strong,
it's...

18:48.667 --> 18:51.902
Oh, man.

18:51.936 --> 18:54.671
Well, this isn't
too embarrassing.

18:54.706 --> 18:59.010
Help!
The Pod Zombies got Brick!

19:02.081 --> 19:04.149
I'll get Brick.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.085
You get the car.

19:12.827 --> 19:16.330
That's it. I am never feeling
anything again. Good boy.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.232
Thanks for blowing our season,
Romeo!

19:19.267 --> 19:20.767
Hey, man!

19:20.801 --> 19:23.236
Come on.
He's a stupid teenager.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.171
You know how they are.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.206
Lock the doors.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.676
Oh, no! Zombies!
Don't eat my brain!

19:32.312 --> 19:33.879
Thanks a lot, Brick!

19:33.913 --> 19:36.983
Why were you standing there,
staring at me like a zombie?

19:37.017 --> 19:39.319
I was memorizing
the fire escape plan

19:39.353 --> 19:41.622
in case the zombies
set the place on fire.

19:41.656 --> 19:44.391
You idiot!
Zombies are afraid of fire!

19:44.425 --> 19:46.594
That doesn't even make sense.

19:46.628 --> 19:48.162
Okay, what is going on?

19:48.197 --> 19:50.164
You two have been
acting weird all week.

19:50.199 --> 19:52.701
I let Brick stay up
and watch a scary movie,

19:52.735 --> 19:55.337
and now he's scarred for life,
and so am I,

19:55.372 --> 19:58.273
and I am a horrible, horrible babysitter.
Is that what this is all about?

19:58.308 --> 20:01.276
If there really were zombies,
don't you think it would be

20:01.311 --> 20:04.279
on the news
or "Access Hollywood"

20:04.314 --> 20:06.781
or something? Come on.

20:06.816 --> 20:11.886
See? I told you mom would make it better.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.922
Axl, that was so romantic,
what you did.

20:14.956 --> 20:16.923
Would you lose a game
for me someday?

20:16.958 --> 20:20.861
Uh, if coach ever lets me
play again, I guess.

20:20.896 --> 20:23.264
Hey, want to get some pizza
with us?

20:23.298 --> 20:25.133
Oh! Well...

20:25.167 --> 20:27.502
Okay.

20:27.537 --> 20:29.571
Gotta eat, I guess.

20:31.475 --> 20:32.875
<i>And just like that,</i>

20:32.909 --> 20:34.878
<i>he was blissfully f
to his next heartbreak,</i>

20:34.912 --> 20:37.847
<i>leaving us to deal
with the mess he left behind.</i>

20:37.882 --> 20:40.383
Hey, here's their car.
Come on! Let's turn it over!

20:40.417 --> 20:43.252
Hey. Whoa. Whoa.
Uh, all right.

20:43.287 --> 20:46.022
Everybody roll with the motion
and avoid eye contact.

20:46.056 --> 20:48.257
I've been on the other side
of this.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.992
They're gonna get bored
and move on eventually.
