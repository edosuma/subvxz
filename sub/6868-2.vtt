WEBVTT

00:01.974 --> 00:04.383
ARCHER: C'mon Cyril,
beat it, get outta here.

00:04.385 --> 00:07.067
ARCHER: This meeting's
for field agents only.

00:07.069 --> 00:09.031
MALORY: Which brings me to item one.

00:09.033 --> 00:13.421
We don't have enough field agents to
effectively run our covert operations.

00:13.423 --> 00:16.612
Especially since this one went
and got himself paralyzed.

00:16.614 --> 00:18.642
GILLETTE: Yeah that's me, Mr. Selfish.

00:18.644 --> 00:19.742
MALORY: More like Ms.

00:19.744 --> 00:23.809
Anyway, effective immediately, I'm
promoting Cyril to field agent.

00:23.811 --> 00:24.340
LANA: What?!

00:24.342 --> 00:24.908
GILLETTE: Do what?!

00:24.910 --> 00:26.539
ARCHER: Hey, that sounds
great, best of luck.

00:26.541 --> 00:28.236
MALORY: Where do you
think you're going?

00:28.238 --> 00:30.702
ARCHER: Oh, sorry, I gotta get back
to Earth before the Stargate closes.

00:30.704 --> 00:31.700
MALORY: Get back in here!

00:31.702 --> 00:33.932
ARCHER: Mother the
chevrons are locking!

00:33.934 --> 00:38.565
LANA: And Cyril is utterly, laughably
unqualified to be a field agent!

00:38.567 --> 00:39.464
Some offense.

00:39.466 --> 00:40.397
CYRIL: Some taken.

00:40.399 --> 00:42.962
MALORY: Well, none of you were
qualified when you first started.

00:42.964 --> 00:46.661
And you've already given Cyril some training...
ARCHER: Which ended with a dead

00:46.663 --> 00:47.894
hooker in my trunk!

00:47.896 --> 00:48.793
CYRIL: No it didn't!

00:48.795 --> 00:49.926
ARCHER: It easily could have!

00:49.928 --> 00:53.291
LANA: Malory, you can't just --
MALORY: End! Of discussion.

00:53.293 --> 00:56.657
And since this meeting is
for field agents only...

00:56.659 --> 00:58.856
GILLETTE: You're taking
me out of the field?!

00:58.858 --> 01:01.989
MALORY: Well, unless we need someone
to go undercover as a shopping cart.

01:01.991 --> 01:05.423
GILLETTE: [annoyed sigh]

01:05.425 --> 01:09.824
MALORY: This is RomaÂ¡n Calzado, the
notorious Colombian drug lord.

01:09.826 --> 01:13.358
And hopefully an infusion
of much-needed capital.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.159
LANA: Since when are we bounty hunters?

01:15.161 --> 01:17.994
MALORY: Since the DEA's budget
was gutted by all those federal

01:17.996 --> 01:19.194
spending cutbacks.

01:19.196 --> 01:21.795
CYRIL: Which is ridiculous,
given the current economy.

01:21.797 --> 01:24.529
The most efficient way to
decrease the budget deficit is

01:24.531 --> 01:28.897
to increase tax revenue, through, um...
MALORY: Cyril don't make me

01:28.899 --> 01:30.363
regret this decision.

01:30.365 --> 01:30.963
CYRIL: Sorry.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.064
MALORY: And if you were in my
tax bracket you wouldn't be

01:33.066 --> 01:35.097
spouting that socialist propaganda.

01:35.099 --> 01:36.798
ARCHER: Or wearing such shitty clothes.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.633
The reward is a million dollars!

01:41.635 --> 01:45.169
LANA: Exactly, and how many drug users
could be treated with that money?

01:45.171 --> 01:46.169
MALORY: Who cares?!

01:46.171 --> 01:47.103
LANA: Seriously?!

01:47.105 --> 01:50.004
ARCHER: Lana, they'd just go buy a
million dollars worth of crack with it.

01:50.006 --> 01:52.173
LANA: You don't give them the money.

01:52.175 --> 01:53.640
ARCHER: You can't, they'll
blow it on crack.

01:53.642 --> 01:56.741
LANA: Oh my God.
MALORY: No they won't, because it'll in the ISIS bank

01:56.743 --> 01:57.275
account.

01:57.277 --> 02:00.543
Because you're going to get
Calzado, dead or alive.

02:00.545 --> 02:04.380
And Cyril, dress appropriately, you'll
be helicoptering into the jungle.

02:04.382 --> 02:08.848
CYRIL: Coool...
MALORY: Oh, and this whole thing reminds me...

02:08.851 --> 02:14.319
Pam? Nine AM Friday morning, all ISIS
employees will take a drug test.

02:14.321 --> 02:17.756
PAM: Nkay.

02:17.758 --> 02:22.392
MALORY: And knock off
that damn beatboxing!

02:22.394 --> 02:23.459
MALORY: Ugh.

02:23.461 --> 02:26.089
Last week it was freestyling.

03:00.661 --> 03:02.228
ARCHER: Yes, this LZ!

03:02.230 --> 03:03.262
You dumbass!

03:03.264 --> 03:05.131
Where we are right now!

03:05.133 --> 03:06.966
In twenty four hours!

03:06.968 --> 03:10.971
And you better be here!

03:10.973 --> 03:11.471
What a dick.

03:11.473 --> 03:14.342
LANA: Well he's probably
just under a lot of stress.

03:14.344 --> 03:18.246
Since he's our only way out
of th stupid jungle! Dumbass!

03:18.248 --> 03:21.048
CYRIL: Seriously...
ARCHER: Thanks, ghost of Teddy Roosevelt.

03:21.050 --> 03:23.250
CYRIL: Ms. Archer said dress for the tropics!

03:23.252 --> 03:25.619
ARCHER: Tropics or Busch Gardens?

03:25.621 --> 03:26.720
CYRIL: Hey, ya know what?!

03:26.722 --> 03:27.488
ARCHER: Yes.

03:27.490 --> 03:28.455
LANA: Heckle?

03:28.457 --> 03:28.856
Jeckle?

03:28.858 --> 03:30.957
Between us and Calzado's fortified
compound there's about

03:30.959 --> 03:34.761
ten clicks of jungle that I just assume
is one giant booby-trap showroom.

03:34.763 --> 03:38.831
So shut your dickholes, get your gear,
shut up again, and start walking.

03:38.833 --> 03:42.368
Any questions?

03:42.370 --> 03:43.970
Cyril.

03:43.972 --> 03:45.605
CYRIL: What's a click.

03:45.607 --> 03:47.473
ARCHER: Yeah you say that all
the time and I never know what

03:47.475 --> 03:48.441
you're talking about.

03:48.443 --> 03:50.676
I'm assuming it's a sound of some sort?

03:50.678 --> 03:51.877
CHERYL/CAROL: Nuh-uhh!

03:51.879 --> 03:54.580
PAM: Swear to God, first thing Friday
morning we all gotta pee in a cup -

03:54.582 --> 03:58.551
GILLETTE: Which I can't even do...
y'all PAM: Cleaning out my freezer

03:58.553 --> 04:00.819
last week, found a big bag of skank.

04:00.821 --> 04:03.956
I guess I brought it back from Jamaica, but --
CHERYL/CAROL: But it's

04:03.958 --> 04:05.258
just a pot test, right?!

04:05.260 --> 04:06.326
PAM: No, stupid.

04:06.328 --> 04:07.427
All drugs.

04:07.429 --> 04:09.295
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh shit.

04:09.297 --> 04:10.430
I call 'em grooving bears.

04:10.432 --> 04:11.798
PAM: How bout you, Ironsides?

04:11.800 --> 04:12.899
You rollin dirty?

04:12.901 --> 04:18.204
GILLETTE: Umm... Possibly.

04:18.206 --> 04:19.805
PAM: Well then we're all screwed.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.774
KRIEGER: Talking about
the drug test, huh?

04:21.777 --> 04:22.342
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh.

04:22.344 --> 04:26.046
KRIEGER: Well -- What if I told
you I had a way to beat any drug

04:26.048 --> 04:27.915
test in the world.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.284
PAM: Are you telling us that?

04:30.286 --> 04:30.985
KRIEGER: Yes.

04:30.987 --> 04:31.819
CHERYL/CAROL: Well?

04:31.821 --> 04:32.386
What is it?!

04:32.388 --> 04:33.954
KRIEGER: I call it... Krieger-Kleanse.

04:33.956 --> 04:36.923
It's an herbal tea, all-natural,
and it's guaranteed to rid your

04:36.925 --> 04:40.093
body of all traces of
any illicit substance.

04:40.095 --> 04:42.162
PAM: Well here, gimme gimme give it!

04:42.164 --> 04:42.762
KRIEGER: Ah ah ahh!

04:42.764 --> 04:47.401
I literal - figuratively scoured the
globe for these special herbs,

04:47.403 --> 04:49.537
at no small expense to myself.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.339
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh. How much.

04:51.341 --> 04:52.373
KRIEGER: Hundred bucks each.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.008
EVERYBODY: [ Complaining ]

04:54.010 --> 04:56.378
KRIEGER: Or you can save your
money, and try your luck in the

04:56.380 --> 05:00.281
current job market.

05:00.283 --> 05:02.183
Non-sequential bills, please.

05:02.185 --> 05:04.318
ARCHER: Well then why
not just say kilometer?

05:04.320 --> 05:05.686
LANA: Because shut up.

05:05.688 --> 05:07.788
ARCHER: Jungle ziiing...
CYRIL: So it says here that

05:07.790 --> 05:10.657
Calzado isn't even the head of the
whole operation... LANA: Cyril.

05:10.659 --> 05:13.960
CYRIL: He's actually just a distributor
for somebody named La Sombra.

05:13.962 --> 05:15.962
The Shade?

05:15.964 --> 05:16.963
LANA: Cyril.

05:16.965 --> 05:19.165
CYRIL: No, I bet in this
context, The Shadow.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.266
LANA: Cyril.

05:20.268 --> 05:20.800
CYRIL: Oof.

05:20.802 --> 05:21.734
Hey, what's your problem?

05:21.736 --> 05:23.970
LANA: My problem is I don't
want a thousand of steel balls

05:23.972 --> 05:25.138
to shred my genitals.

05:25.140 --> 05:25.739
CYRIL: Huh?

05:25.741 --> 05:26.473
ARCHER: Claymore mine.

05:26.475 --> 05:30.110
Full of steel balls that fly a
thousand meters - or one click -

05:30.112 --> 05:32.046
a second, right at dick level.

05:32.048 --> 05:35.550
CYRIL: Jeezy petes...
LANA: Or ass level, which in your case would also

05:35.552 --> 05:36.585
take off your head.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.954
So quit reading and pay attention.

05:38.956 --> 05:41.957
CYRIL: But there's a lot of useful
stuff in here, organizational charts,

05:41.959 --> 05:45.326
inventory and cash-flow analyses...
spreadsheets?

05:45.328 --> 05:48.029
ARCHER: Of what, possible
outcomes with a twenty-sided die?

05:48.031 --> 05:49.997
CYRIL: Well you don't need
a spreadsheet for that...

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
ARCHER: Yeah and you don't need
one to know you're gonna suck at

05:52.001 --> 05:53.300
being a field agent Cyril.

05:53.302 --> 05:54.868
So why do you wanna be one?

05:54.870 --> 05:59.306
CYRIL: I dunno, I just wanna feel
like I'm a part of the team, ya know?

05:59.308 --> 06:01.942
I guess I wanna...
feel like I matter more.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.378
ARCHER: Wow, not afraid to dump out
your purse in the jungle, huh?

06:05.380 --> 06:07.280
Okay Cyril, then lesson One-A.

06:07.282 --> 06:11.318
In a potentially hostile environment,
like this, the key is total situational

06:11.320 --> 06:12.485
awareness.

06:12.487 --> 06:14.921
CYRIL: Okay...
ARCHER: You look, you listen, you smell.

06:14.923 --> 06:16.656
And you remember to check your six.

06:16.658 --> 06:17.723
CYRIL: My six what.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.858
Is that my gun?

06:18.860 --> 06:19.859
The old six shooter.

06:19.861 --> 06:22.762
ARCHER: Oh my God, a clock
Cyril, It means behind you.

06:22.764 --> 06:25.899
Because the last thing you want
is -- Uh Lana, hold up a sec?

06:25.901 --> 06:29.502
LANA: Archer we don't have a -- Cyril?

06:29.504 --> 06:31.104
ARCHER: Yeah, that's
why I said hold up.

06:31.106 --> 06:31.604
LANA: Archer!

06:31.606 --> 06:34.540
ARCHER: Don't yell at me, I looked away
for literally literally one second!

06:34.542 --> 06:35.941
LANA: Well where the hell did he go?!

06:35.943 --> 06:43.182
ARCHER: I dunno, it's like... he just...
LANA: You're looking for

06:43.184 --> 06:45.686
Predator, aren't you?

06:45.688 --> 06:46.853
ARCHER: Yes.

06:46.855 --> 06:47.654
LANA: Couple things.

06:47.656 --> 06:51.191
A, he's invisible --
ARCHER: Not totally, he has a telltale shimmer.

06:51.193 --> 06:51.725
Ow!

06:51.727 --> 06:53.894
LANA: And B, lower your frickin voice.

06:53.896 --> 06:54.628
MAN: ÃÂ¡Oye!!

06:54.630 --> 06:56.063
Manos arriba!

06:56.065 --> 06:56.864
ARCHER: Is that Cyril?

06:56.866 --> 06:57.765
MAN: Â¿Quien es?!

06:57.767 --> 07:00.268
ARCHER: No, it's not whimpery enough.

07:00.270 --> 07:03.071
LANA: Cyril! Cyril!

07:03.073 --> 07:03.938
God damn it.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.274
ARCHER: Well, look on the bright side.

07:06.276 --> 07:08.009
LANA: Which is?

07:08.011 --> 07:08.643
ARCHER: Which is what?

07:08.645 --> 07:10.111
LANA: What's the bright side?!

07:10.113 --> 07:10.878
ARCHER: Oh.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.614
That's a figure of speech.

07:15.906 --> 07:19.843
ARCHER: All I'm saying is there are a
million green rectangularly reasons to

07:19.845 --> 07:22.146
complete the mission, and
zero reasons not to.

07:22.148 --> 07:23.847
LANA: You mean besides
Cyril getting captured.

07:23.849 --> 07:24.948
ARCHER: Yeah! Besides that.

07:24.950 --> 07:28.552
And if Calzado's men got Cyril, we'll
rescue him when we get Calzado.

07:28.554 --> 07:31.488
Problemo solvedo.
LANA: What if it was F.A.R.K.

07:31.490 --> 07:32.222
or V.E.L.N.

07:32.224 --> 07:35.391
ARCHER: Then we'll use some of the
million dollar reward to pay his ransom.

07:35.393 --> 07:39.462
So shut up, Cyril's going to be fine.

07:39.464 --> 07:40.363
Unless a tiger ate him.

07:40.365 --> 07:42.532
LANA: Tigers don't
live in South America.

07:42.534 --> 07:45.868
ARCHER: Well at least one does because
I just heard its spine-tingling roar.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.370
LANA: That was a jaguar, dumbass.

07:47.372 --> 07:49.271
ARCHER: Thanks, Marlon Perkins.

07:49.273 --> 07:54.209
I think I know a tiger when I hear one.

07:54.211 --> 07:58.380
LANA: Every time, your big fat
mouth get's us caught, every time.

07:58.382 --> 08:02.550
ARCHER: Not every time,
like a third of the time.

08:02.552 --> 08:06.787
And a thousand bucks
that's a tiger Lana.

08:06.789 --> 08:09.022
CHERYL/CAROL: If this doesn't
work we just paid a hundred

08:09.024 --> 08:10.390
bucks for liquid fart.

08:10.392 --> 08:14.962
PAM: Yeah, well here's
shit in your eye.

08:14.964 --> 08:17.565
GILLETE: Oh god, it tastes
worse than it smells.

08:17.567 --> 08:22.104
PAM: Man, if I had a nickel for every
time I heard a guy said that,

08:22.106 --> 08:24.006
I'd have eight nickels.

08:24.008 --> 08:26.709
LANA: Archer, I swear to
God if you don't shut up.

08:26.711 --> 08:30.313
ARCHER: I'm just saying if it comes
down to that, and I hope it doesn't,

08:30.315 --> 08:33.316
there's no sense in us
both getting raped.

08:33.318 --> 08:38.154
CALZADO: Fernando, our special guests
must not be injured in any way.

08:38.155 --> 08:40.222
ARCHER: Uh, does that include
rape related injuries?

08:40.225 --> 08:40.924
CALZADO: Of course.

08:40.926 --> 08:42.525
No one is going to rape you.

08:42.527 --> 08:43.726
What is wrong with you?

08:43.727 --> 08:44.394
LANA: We're scared.

08:44.396 --> 08:46.495
We're just tourists, see,
and our car broke down.

08:46.497 --> 08:51.133
CALZADO: So the assault weapons and plastic
explosives, why do you have these?

08:51.135 --> 08:52.735
ARCHER: O.: yes, let me explain.

08:52.737 --> 08:54.804
Busted, we're arms dealers.

08:54.806 --> 08:57.841
CALZADO: No, I think not.

08:57.843 --> 09:00.110
I Think you are hunting RomaÂ¡n Calzado.

09:00.112 --> 09:02.179
In the hopes of a
million dollar reward.

09:02.181 --> 09:04.248
ARCHER: O.K. yes, busted again.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.052
But I think now we're
kinda rethinking that.

09:07.054 --> 09:09.955
CALZADO: So, if I give you two
million, will you go away

09:09.957 --> 09:11.156
and say you never found me?

09:11.158 --> 09:13.425
LANA: I -- Oh my God, totally yes.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.694
ARCHER: Then we give mother a
million and you and I can

09:15.696 --> 09:17.262
split the other million.

09:17.264 --> 09:19.531
Calzado, you've got yourself a deal.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.398
CALZADO: Excellent.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.367
But of course I was joking.

09:22.369 --> 09:24.469
Obviously I can not allow you to live.

09:24.471 --> 09:25.537
ARCHER: No, yes you can.

09:25.539 --> 09:29.640
CALZADO: Or choose not to, whatever,
besides, throwing money away like that

09:29.642 --> 09:31.042
would not please el contador.

09:31.044 --> 09:32.776
LANA: El contador, doesn't that mean.

09:32.778 --> 09:35.279
CYRIL: The accountant, si.

09:35.281 --> 09:36.648
ARCHER: Cyril?!

09:36.650 --> 09:38.450
CALZADO: Que?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.452
LANA: No he said cereal.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.220
CALZADO: Que?

09:41.222 --> 09:43.222
CYRIL: Cerealas.

09:43.224 --> 09:45.525
El quiere desayuno.

09:45.527 --> 09:53.134
CALZADO: And people in
hell want ice water.

09:53.136 --> 09:54.335
Oye.

09:54.337 --> 09:59.373
CYRIL: Pardon.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.307
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God!

10:00.309 --> 10:04.579
I'm gonna die in a toilet stall
just like the gypsy said.

10:04.581 --> 10:06.215
PAM: Damn that Krieger.

10:06.217 --> 10:08.083
Nazi-clone-bastard.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.553
GILLETTE: Well, we don't
know it was the tea.

10:10.555 --> 10:11.153
PAM: Aagh!

10:11.155 --> 10:12.187
Who the hell are you?!

10:12.189 --> 10:14.990
GILLETTE: I'm your friend,
Pam, I'm -- Pam?!

10:14.992 --> 10:18.927
PAM: You're not my friend, you're a Decepticon.
CHERYL/CAROL: Waaaagh!

10:18.929 --> 10:20.963
How are you both still alive?!

10:20.965 --> 10:23.031
The floor is lava!

10:23.033 --> 10:26.368
The floor is lava!

10:26.370 --> 10:27.969
KRIEGER: Clinical trial thirteen.

10:27.971 --> 10:31.105
Subjects' responses are
exceeding expectations.

10:31.107 --> 10:32.707
GILLETTE: Pam you're melting!

10:32.709 --> 10:33.541
You're melting!

10:33.543 --> 10:36.877
CHERYL/CAROL: Because the
floor is lah-vuh-huhhhh!

10:36.879 --> 10:40.780
PAM: Must! Kill! Decepticon!

10:40.782 --> 10:42.482
KRIEGER: Oh, which reminds me:

10:42.484 --> 10:44.317
call Terry.

10:44.319 --> 10:45.351
RROWWR!

10:45.353 --> 10:48.387
ARCHER: The tiger says... RROWWR!

10:48.389 --> 10:52.190
ARCHER: The tiger also says you
owe me a thousand dollars, so -

10:52.192 --> 10:52.858
LANA: No! I don't!

10:52.860 --> 10:54.293
Because I didn't bet!

10:54.295 --> 10:56.962
ARCHER: The welsher says...
CYRIL: Psssst!

10:56.964 --> 10:58.264
ARCHER: No, that's a snake.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.266
CYRIL: Oh boy, am I
glad to see you guys!

11:00.268 --> 11:01.701
LANA: Cyril, what the
hell's going on?!

11:01.703 --> 11:03.570
ARCHER: Are you a drug
dealer now, or...?

11:03.572 --> 11:04.805
CYRIL: What? No!

11:04.807 --> 11:06.607
And you guys aren't gonna
believe what happened!

11:06.609 --> 11:11.178
I had, um, gastric distress, or whatever,
so I was just gonna duck off the

11:11.180 --> 11:13.381
trail...
ARCHER: And you remember to check your six.

11:13.383 --> 11:14.215
CYRIL: My six what?

11:14.217 --> 11:23.189
CYRIL: Before I knew what was happening...
Oh man, right in my new pants!

11:23.191 --> 11:24.057
HENCHMAN: ÃÂ¡Oye!

11:24.059 --> 11:26.226
CYRIL: Hellooo...
HENCHMAN:! Manos arriba!Â¿!

11:26.228 --> 11:27.260
Quien es?!

11:27.262 --> 11:31.497
CYRIL: And I only had a second to answer,
so I thought, what would Lana do?

11:31.499 --> 11:33.132
ARCHER: Not Archer?

11:33.134 --> 11:34.967
CYRIL: No, I had to outsmart them.

11:34.969 --> 11:38.671
ARCHER: He said, suddenly too big
for his shit-caked britches.

11:38.673 --> 11:39.238
LANA: Archer.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.773
CYRIL: And then it came to me!

11:40.775 --> 11:43.075
Uh... quien soy?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.077
Soy el contador!

11:45.079 --> 11:46.745
Enviado de La Sombra!

11:46.747 --> 11:48.647
Donde estaÂ¡ Calzado?!

11:48.649 --> 11:49.714
ARCHER: What's a La Sombra?

11:49.716 --> 11:52.451
CYRIL: Calzado's boss, don't
you remember the dossier?

11:52.453 --> 11:53.285
ARCHER: No.

11:53.287 --> 11:53.853
LANA: Yes.

11:53.855 --> 11:57.857
But, what about the gunshot?

11:57.859 --> 12:00.394
CYRIL: Then they brought me here, and
I bluffed my way through the rest...

12:00.396 --> 12:02.629
CALZADO: La Sombra did
not say you were coming.

12:02.631 --> 12:05.833
CYRIL: Well, I assume he did not want to
give you the time to cook your books.

12:05.835 --> 12:08.303
CALZADO: I -- that -- I
swear I don't do that!

12:08.305 --> 12:09.771
CYRIL: Well, then you are a fool.

12:09.773 --> 12:10.505
CALZADO: Â¿Que?

12:10.507 --> 12:13.174
CYRIL: You pay La Sombra sixty-four
cents on every dollar you make, no?

12:13.176 --> 12:17.312
CALZADO: Mmmmas o menos, pero...
CYRIL: I can get that down to thirty cents,

12:17.314 --> 12:19.214
and he will never even know.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.849
CALZADO: Si?! Pero como?!

12:20.851 --> 12:22.884
CYRIL: You just leave
that to me, amigo.

12:22.886 --> 12:27.322
CALZADO: Wait, what's in this for you?

12:27.324 --> 12:29.924
CYRIL: We split the
difference, of course!

12:29.926 --> 12:31.560
But first I need some clean clothes.

12:31.562 --> 12:35.130
This is not mud all over my pants.

12:35.132 --> 12:35.897
It's caca.

12:35.899 --> 12:37.199
LANA: Holy shit, Cyril!

12:37.201 --> 12:38.634
ARCHER: Literally.

12:38.636 --> 12:41.403
CYRIL: Yeah, really kinda wish I'd
skipped the diarrhea part...

12:41.405 --> 12:43.038
LANA: Forget that, you did great!

12:43.040 --> 12:43.639
CYRIL: Really?

12:43.641 --> 12:47.242
ARCHER: It figuratively kills me to
say this Cyril, but yeah, you did.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.978
LANA: So now what, what's the plan?

12:48.980 --> 12:51.613
CYRIL: Oh. Well, I was hoping you
guys could come up with something.

12:51.615 --> 12:54.416
And ideally before tomorrow at dawn.

12:54.418 --> 12:56.852
ARCHER: Why, what's --
CALZADO: What is going on here?!

12:56.854 --> 12:57.620
CYRIL: Ah, amigo!

12:57.622 --> 13:02.325
I was just mocking this giant
negress and her sissy sidekick.

13:02.327 --> 13:04.961
CALZADO: Yes, they are ridiculous, no?

13:04.963 --> 13:07.096
Are the accommodations to your liking?

13:07.098 --> 13:07.830
ARCHER: Honestly?

13:07.832 --> 13:08.197
LANA: No.

13:08.199 --> 13:10.366
You shouldn't even keep
animals in these conditions.

13:10.368 --> 13:11.000
Look at them.

13:11.002 --> 13:15.838
Cement floors, steel bars, no room to
run around, nothing to play with...

13:15.840 --> 13:18.775
CALZADO: Ah, I think perhaps you
are confusing this with a zoo.

13:18.777 --> 13:21.745
ARCHER: I think, maybe, it's
all these exotic animals.

13:21.747 --> 13:24.248
CALZADO: Yes, exotic
animals for me to hunt.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.215
LANA: You hunt them?!

13:25.217 --> 13:26.417
How can you do that?!

13:26.419 --> 13:29.153
CALZADO: Like this.

13:29.155 --> 13:30.421
ARCHER: God damn dude.

13:30.423 --> 13:31.188
CALZADO: But you see?

13:31.190 --> 13:34.358
Even the majestic Bengal
tiger is too easy to kill!

13:34.360 --> 13:34.992
It's boring!

13:34.994 --> 13:37.828
Which is why tomorrow at dawn,
I will be hunting the most

13:37.830 --> 13:40.097
dangerous game in the world!

13:40.099 --> 13:41.364
ARCHER: Jai alai?

13:41.366 --> 13:42.065
LANA: Us!

13:42.067 --> 13:42.798
ARCHER: What?!

13:42.800 --> 13:43.299
CALZADO: Si.

13:43.301 --> 13:44.066
So sleep well, amigos!

13:44.068 --> 13:46.101
I want you rested and
strong for tomorrow!

13:46.103 --> 13:48.703
Venga, Senor Contador, cenamos juntos!

13:48.705 --> 13:51.539
CYRIL: So yeah, try to think of a plan!

13:51.541 --> 13:54.209
LANA: Well, go ahead and say it.

13:54.211 --> 13:54.742
ARCHER: Say what.

13:54.744 --> 13:57.345
LANA: How since we're gonna die in
the morning we should have sex now.

13:57.347 --> 13:59.982
ARCHER: After seeing a
tiger get murdered, Lana?

13:59.984 --> 14:04.886
No offense, but I'm not
really in the mood.

14:04.888 --> 14:07.155
If you want, I can watch
while you masturbate.

14:07.157 --> 14:09.991
But I can tell you right now
my he's not gonna be in it.

14:09.993 --> 14:12.827
It will be with that tiger's family.

14:12.829 --> 14:16.396
But, go ahead, start.

14:19.548 --> 14:23.518
CALZADO: And so begins the hunt
for the most dangerous game!

14:23.520 --> 14:26.354
CYRIL: Hooray...
LANA: So what are the les here, exactly?

14:26.356 --> 14:26.988
ARCHER: Lana be still.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.956
CALZADO: You get a
thirty-minute head start.

14:28.958 --> 14:33.161
Then El Contador and I, just us,
alone, will track you and kill you.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.595
CYRIL: Uh, uh... oh!

14:34.597 --> 14:35.497
Can they split up?

14:35.499 --> 14:36.865
CALZADO: Ehhh, sure, why not.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.234
CYRIL: Then I propose a friendly wager.

14:39.236 --> 14:42.538
We each hunt one of them, and the first
to kill his quarry is the winner.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.839
CALZADO: I like this idea.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.375
But which --
CYRIL: I get the woman called it boom!

14:46.377 --> 14:51.914
CALZADO: I -- alright,
since you called it.

14:51.916 --> 14:56.653
Â¡Oye! Cochino...
Okay, let's hunt some humans!

14:56.655 --> 14:58.822
LANA: Go go go go gunngh!

14:58.824 --> 15:00.624
Are you really that selfish?!

15:00.626 --> 15:03.761
ARCHER: Apparently!

15:03.763 --> 15:05.796
KRIEGER: Clinical trial
thirteen, update.

15:05.798 --> 15:08.765
As hypothesized, after
mind-shredding hallucinations,

15:08.767 --> 15:14.271
subjects B and C have lapsed into deep
unconsciousness... Subject A, however,

15:14.273 --> 15:17.207
remains at large.

15:17.209 --> 15:22.846
Begin clinical trial fourteen...
CYRIL: Lana? Lana.

15:22.848 --> 15:24.582
Where the heck is - shmmpf!

15:24.584 --> 15:25.817
LANA: Don't scream, it's me.

15:25.819 --> 15:29.420
CYRIL: Oh thank God, I thought those were yeti hands...
LANA: Never gets old.

15:29.422 --> 15:31.990
But good idea back there,
getting everybody to split up.

15:31.992 --> 15:35.828
CYRIL: Thanks, yeah, I figured you'd know
to head back to the, uh, LZ thingy --

15:35.830 --> 15:38.030
LANA: Which we've only got
about an hour to get to so --

15:38.032 --> 15:40.366
CYRIL: -- and I figured once I
found you we could work together

15:40.368 --> 15:43.302
to rescue Archer, capture
Calzado, and escape.

15:43.304 --> 15:45.738
LANA: Ya know, you don't
actually suck at this.

15:45.740 --> 15:46.505
CYRIL: Really?

15:46.507 --> 15:48.674
LANA: You're thinking tactically, making
quick decisions... and I gotta tell

15:48.676 --> 15:51.444
ya, confidence is pretty damn sexy.

15:51.446 --> 15:53.679
CYRIL: Reeally...
LANA: Theoretically.

15:53.681 --> 15:54.280
CYRIL: Sorry.

15:54.282 --> 15:57.650
LANA: Okay, you're doing pretty well
so far, so what's the plan, rookie?

15:57.652 --> 15:59.785
And sooner would be better than later.

15:59.787 --> 16:01.887
CYRIL: Yeah, Calzado's
on a darn threewheeler.

16:01.889 --> 16:02.888
Can you believe that guy?

16:02.890 --> 16:05.691
LANA: Who, the drug-lord who
hunts humans for sport?

16:05.693 --> 16:07.459
CYRIL: I know, but that's just lame.

16:07.461 --> 16:07.993
LANA: Cyril?

16:07.995 --> 16:11.196
CYRIL: Uh, uh, okay, so we have to assume
Archer's heading back to the LZ too,

16:11.198 --> 16:15.233
but he can't possibly outrun Calzado...
LANA: Yeah, neither can we, so...?

16:15.235 --> 16:16.968
CYRIL: We don't need to outrun him!

16:16.970 --> 16:17.969
Just Archer!

16:17.971 --> 16:18.469
LANA: What?

16:18.471 --> 16:20.471
CYRIL: Come on!

16:20.473 --> 16:22.206
ARCHER: Oww!

16:22.208 --> 16:24.708
Oh eat a dick, jungle!

16:24.710 --> 16:28.444
Cover it with malaria and leeches,
sprinkle some dengue fever on it,

16:28.446 --> 16:32.015
and eat a big goddamn jungly dick!

16:32.017 --> 16:37.220
Yeah, you do that, and I'll just wait
here for a bask of Orinoco crocodiles to

16:37.222 --> 16:39.756
wander by and eat me.

16:39.758 --> 16:44.361
Oh great, that's probably them now,
tearing around on specially-equipped

16:44.363 --> 16:45.809
croc-choppers.

16:45.929 --> 16:47.302
Wait, what the...?

17:00.748 --> 17:04.950
Goddess of the Jungle,
I take it all back!

17:04.952 --> 17:11.656
For when I was thirsty, you saw
fit to slake my thiiiiiirrrrst!

17:11.657 --> 17:15.659
Goddess of the Jungle, you are a whore.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.560
Oh thank God, I thought
you were crocodiles.

17:18.563 --> 17:19.561
CALZADO: Crocodiles?

17:19.564 --> 17:20.797
On a three-wheeler?

17:20.799 --> 17:21.364
ARCHER: Right?

17:21.366 --> 17:22.531
How scary would that be?

17:22.534 --> 17:25.367
CALZADO: Mmm, probably not as scary as
knowing that I am going to cut you down

17:25.369 --> 17:28.305
from there, and then
gut you like a fish.

17:28.307 --> 17:31.641
ARCHER: Well then you're obviously an
idiot when it comes to crocodiles,

17:31.643 --> 17:34.511
AKA the world's most
deadliest predators.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.947
CALZADO: I am the world's
deadliest predator!

17:36.949 --> 17:38.182
CYRIL: Or are you?

17:38.184 --> 17:38.849
CALZADO: Ã¿Que?

17:38.851 --> 17:39.383
ARCHER: Cyril?!

17:39.385 --> 17:40.251
CALZADO: No breakfast for you!

17:40.253 --> 17:42.387
CYRIL: No, that's my name, Calzado.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.323
Cyril Figgis... ISIS agent.

17:44.325 --> 17:45.991
CALZADO: Bastardo mentiroso!

17:45.993 --> 17:46.525
ISIS?!

17:46.527 --> 17:47.326
CYRIL: That's right.

17:47.328 --> 17:49.194
And you're under arrest.

17:49.196 --> 17:50.395
Albeit extra-judicially.

17:50.397 --> 17:52.163
CALZADO: Over my dead body!

17:52.165 --> 17:53.932
CYRIL: Well, that can be arranged.

17:53.934 --> 17:55.500
Lana?

17:55.502 --> 17:59.070
LANA: Hellooo... CALZADO: Ay, caramba...
ARCHER: Wh-? Wait a minute,

17:59.072 --> 17:59.504
was I just bait?!

17:59.506 --> 18:00.438
CYRIL: That's right, Archer.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.641
All part of my brilliant plan.

18:02.643 --> 18:05.277
Lana, get some vines and
tie him up, chop-chop.

18:05.279 --> 18:06.478
LANA: Chop-chop?

18:06.480 --> 18:09.082
ARCHER: Here we go...
CYRIL: Uh yeah, it means hurry?

18:09.084 --> 18:12.485
C'mon, we got a chopper
to catch, tie him up!

18:12.487 --> 18:13.487
LANA: You do it.

18:13.489 --> 18:15.222
CYRIL: Okay, I see what
you're doing here.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.824
Hands behind your back, Calzado.

18:16.826 --> 18:17.858
CALZADO: Make me.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.261
CYRIL: I -- look, she will shoot you!

18:20.263 --> 18:21.162
LANA: No I won't.

18:21.164 --> 18:23.164
ARCHER: No she won't!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.500
C'mon Cyril, go all rogue on him!

18:25.502 --> 18:30.005
CYRIL: Guys c'mon, this
is ridicul -- ungh!

18:30.007 --> 18:33.074
I think I'm gonna be -- ungh!

18:33.076 --> 18:37.711
Yeah, I'm gonna be sick...
ARCHER: Here, maybe this'll help...

18:37.713 --> 18:41.648
CYRIL: Aaagh! My eyes!

18:41.650 --> 18:43.116
ARCHER: Probably shouldn't
have done that.

18:43.118 --> 18:47.753
Not enough left to get drunk on.

18:47.755 --> 18:49.322
CALZADO: Bastardo!

18:49.324 --> 18:52.525
I kill you!

18:52.527 --> 18:55.228
CYRIL: Lanaaaa!

18:55.230 --> 18:56.629
CALZADO: What the hell damn guy.

18:56.631 --> 18:59.232
CYRIL: Oh thank you thank you thank you...
LANA: You're welcome, Cyril.

18:59.234 --> 19:02.101
So, did you learn any
valuable lessons today?

19:02.103 --> 19:03.336
CYRIL: Yes, I did.

19:03.338 --> 19:05.271
ARCHER: Me too.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.907
I learned I don't like being bait.

19:07.909 --> 19:08.708
CYRIL: Owww!

19:08.710 --> 19:10.743
ARCHER: Sorry, Cyril, did that hurt?

19:10.745 --> 19:14.647
Cyril. Cyril.

19:14.649 --> 19:15.414
Cyriiillll!

19:15.416 --> 19:16.682
CYRIL: Yes it frickin hurt!

19:16.684 --> 19:18.050
ARCHER: Yeah, right?

19:18.052 --> 19:18.884
MALORY: What?!

19:18.886 --> 19:20.952
Yes, obviously I heard what you said!

19:20.954 --> 19:25.823
I just can't believe the head of
the DEA has the balls to say it!

19:25.825 --> 19:27.859
Oh, is that a fact!

19:27.861 --> 19:29.427
Oh it is.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.630
M-hm. Yep.

19:32.632 --> 19:35.900
ARCHER: So, uh... How'd that go?

19:35.902 --> 19:36.568
MALORY: Oh, fine.

19:36.570 --> 19:39.404
He was just explaining to me why
ISIS won't be receiving any

19:39.406 --> 19:41.673
reward for capturing Calzado.

19:41.675 --> 19:43.208
EVERYBODY: [ What?!]

19:43.210 --> 19:46.612
Because apparently there's
no proof that we did.

19:46.614 --> 19:48.947
LANA: We literally
handed Calzado to them!

19:48.949 --> 19:52.884
MALORY: And in return, did they hand
you a signed receipt for the prisoner?

19:52.886 --> 19:55.119
ARCHER: No, they -- oh.

19:55.121 --> 19:55.886
LANA: Oh, shit.

19:55.888 --> 19:58.155
MALORY: Mm. So, well done.

19:58.157 --> 20:02.493
Because that's exactly the brand of
unparalleled professional excellence that

20:02.495 --> 20:04.328
I've come to expect at ISIS.

20:04.330 --> 20:05.429
PAM: No no no no nooo!

20:05.431 --> 20:07.698
ARCHER: What the --
CYRIL: Oh, I wish I was still blind.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.535
PAM: You'll never take me aliiiive!

20:11.537 --> 20:13.404
MALORY: What was I saying?

20:13.406 --> 20:17.175
Oh yes, unparalleled...
KRIEGER: Paaaam!

20:17.177 --> 20:21.580
For the love of God, seal the exits!

20:21.582 --> 20:26.553
MALORY: Professional...
CHERYL/CAROL: That's our pee,

20:26.555 --> 20:28.555
and that's the last I
better hear about it.

20:28.557 --> 20:37.329
Because this stupid building is a tinderbox,
and I will burn it to the ground.

20:37.331 --> 20:38.731
MALORY: Excellence.

20:38.733 --> 20:42.800
ARCHER: Oh hey, speaking of excellent,
did you hear we met a tiger?!

20:42.802 --> 20:45.133
But he got murdered.
