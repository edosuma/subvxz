Hands behind your back!

00:08.842 --> 00:10.673

00:28.362 --> 00:32.901
And Andy McNally.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.238
You have the right to shut up.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.948
You have the right to remain calm,

00:38.997 --> 00:41.374
and you have the right
to get out of these handcuffs

00:41.416 --> 00:43.372
any way you know how!

Are you ready?

Give me the key.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.298

01:48.025 --> 01:50.482
What is going on here, Peck?

01:53.030 --> 01:55.521
- I'm not doing anything.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.031
Ohh!

Oh, this bar bill's gonna cost me a fortune.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.845
I know. Your entire allowance.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.265
Andy, you were robbed.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.060
Mm, yeah, by the cheater.
Robo-cheater.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.977
You know what?
He said any way you know how, anyway,

02:36.031 --> 02:37.862
so whatever.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.358
I love this job so much, you know?

02:42.412 --> 02:46.872
It's funny, but I love all these guys so much.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.498
You don't even know them.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.159
It doesn't matter.
We're already brothers.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.445
(Andy) So here we are.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.861
We ’ve spent the last few months together
training to do this job.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.870
We ’ve learned how to shoot and ﬁght

04:09.916 --> 04:11.872
and drive a police car really fast.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.374
/ mean, we ’re ready.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.786
/ mean, they keep telling us
we don 't know anything.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.582
That it doesn’t matter how well
we did at the academy.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.374
That you might be a legacy

04:21.428 --> 04:24.090
and you think you know the job
inside and out.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.591
Maybe you’re hip to the street.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.258
Maybe you can shoot a paper target
from a mile away.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.267
It actually doesn’t matter.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.895
There is absolutely no training

04:33.940 --> 04:36.556
that prepares you for life on the street.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.855
And on that cautionary note,
welcome to 15.

04:41.907 --> 04:45.195
Serve, protect...

04:45.243 --> 04:47.495
and don't screw up.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.952
- Okay, now I’m nervous.
- You nervous?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.208
- Nope.
- Of course not. You're a frickin' machine.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.993
Traci, we get in the car.
They drive us around.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.038
I mean, anything happens,
they tell us what to do.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.376
I know what to do.
I spent three months at the academy

05:01.426 --> 05:04.008
preparing myself for exactly what to do.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.512
- Ready for anything.
- Ready for anything.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.891
.l‘ Please tell me what there is
to complain about .l‘

05:11.937 --> 05:13.643
Chris Diaz.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.395
Six beers, two whiskeys, and a stack
of brand-new divorce papers.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.023
Uh... Sir?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.025
Last night's scorecard.

05:21.071 --> 05:26.065
Means I'm not exactly overflowing
with patience, team spirit, thrill of the job.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.070
Shall we?

05:28.119 --> 05:31.111
Uh, uh, yeah, guess I'm going.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.155
(man) Okay, so I'll see you later, all right?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.618
Hi.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.205
Great.
| get Jenny from the block.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.541
That is not coming in my car.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.751

- McNally, sir.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.259

05:46.304 --> 05:48.681
Okay, well, thanks for the update,
Andy McNally. Let's go.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.929
Okay.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.846
- Oh. The bag?
- In the back.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.897
You know, people can smell new cops
like they can smell fresh paint.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.692
You look new. You sound new.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.245
- We are new.
- I know. I know.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.870
That's my point.
That's why we have to have the talk.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.871
- What talk?
- The "Don't embarrass me,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.875
"your radio is on the wrong side of your belt,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.706
uh, do as I say, not as I do" talk.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.087
(woman dispatcher) We have a trouble
unknown at 306 Dunn Avenue

06:23.133 --> 06:25.670
near Jameson and King.
Is there a unit available to attend?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
Hey, that's right over there.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.045
Yeah, 306 is a hole.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.134
l was there twice last week
for drunk and disorderly.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.595
We're gonna let Noelle take that one,
and you and l are gonna go have a coffee.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.431
- We're gonna continue to have the talk.
- Okay.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.857
1519. Are you 10-8 yet?
Can you take the call?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.936
Terrific. Go ahead.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.401
It's the black button.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.732
1519--

06:46.781 --> 06:50.615
- The other black button.
- Oh. 1519, 10-4.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.446
Are you happy?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.286
Okay, let's hit it.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.424

Okay, uh, tell me what's happening.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.594
- lt's apartment 202.
- Uh-huh.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.679
It's bad enough in there
without people yelling and screaming.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.888
Okay. Um, McNally, get out of the car.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.603
Okay. So people are yelling.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.856
A couple of guys in there.
They're going at each other.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.141
It's like freakin' pit bulls, man.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.310
Okay, wait a second.
They're like pit bulls, or they have pit bulls?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.435
Man, I don't know.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.478
(girl) Are you a policeman?

07:28.531 --> 07:31.944
Uh, you know, woman, officer.
Policewoman/officer.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.201
- Yeah, I mean, well, yes.
- Can I see your gun?

07:35.246 --> 07:38.329
Oh, I'm sorry. It's really dangerous, okay?
You have to be very--

07:38.375 --> 07:39.490
(gunshots, screaming)

07:39.542 --> 07:41.203
Ma'am.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.289

07:44.339 --> 07:47.502
Calling for backup.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go!

07:57.018 --> 07:58.974
Stay right behind me.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.103
You cover me.
Don't shoot me in the back.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.352
Whoa! Okay...

08:05.402 --> 08:07.814
Sir, get back inside. Close your door.

08:07.862 --> 08:12.276
1519. We're on the first floor,
about to head up the front stairs.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.317
(woman on radio)
1505. We're almost there.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.703
Sir? Sir, gunshots fired.
Shouldn't we wait for backup?

08:18.748 --> 08:21.125
We got little kids in this building.
You want to wait for backup, you go ahead.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.202
You knock yourself out.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.750

So ljust follow you in, right?
Gun in, gun out?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.642

09:38.787 --> 09:40.368
I think we got an OD.
She's barely breathing.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.619
I wouldn't touch her with a 10-foot pole.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.655
- You--you wait for the medics.
- But she's just a kid.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.871
Get up.
All units, apartment 202 is clear.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.832
Sadie, I gotta cuff you. Okay.
Now let's plug it in, okay?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.247
You gotta tell me exactly--
exactly what happened.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.131
I don't know, 'cause I wasn't in here.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.587
Oh, yeah? Well, that's funny,
because you know what?

09:55.637 --> 09:58.094
- You're supposed to be in jail.
- I'm on probation.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.754
(exhales)

10:00.642 --> 10:02.382
(whispering)
One, two, three, four, five...

10:02.435 --> 10:05.643
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Come on.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.189
- We're reallyjust supposed to sit here?
- I'm on the phone.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.395
We're missing all the action.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.772
(Gail speaks indistinctly, giggles)

10:13.822 --> 10:17.565
Uh, excuse me. Sir? Hi.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.694
Uh, quick question.
Uh, lwas wondering, uh,

10:21.746 --> 10:24.613
How would I,

10:24.666 --> 10:25.872
- Spit it out.
- Oh.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.283
Uh, can I take my gun home
with me at night?

10:28.336 --> 10:29.746
VVhy?

10:29.796 --> 10:33.288
You know, just to, uh, to have it,
to get used to it, to clean it.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.918
Take-home forms are in the second drawer.
You fill one out, then I decide.

10:37.971 --> 10:38.960
Thank you, sir.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.306
(Gail) Big man.

Ahh. Thank you very much.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.984
(door beeps)

10:59.534 --> 11:00.523
Sir.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.910
Picked her up at St. Joe's,
stealing drugs from the nurse's station.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.455
Get her tombstone |.D.,
search her, put her in a cell.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.740
Sarge is on his way.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.289
What? I can't search a lady.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.045
(door buzzes, beeps)

11:17.427 --> 11:20.385
Okay, uh... Name?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.845

11:25.560 --> 11:27.096
and I'm innocent, by the way.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.931
No, l- -yeah, I'm sure you are.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.145
Uh, do you have any injuries, Tabby?

Are you on any medication?

Finasteride, Spironolactone,
Premarin, Estrogen, Estradiol.

11:40.575 --> 11:41.860

l'm transgendered.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.954
Not bad, huh?

11:48.875 --> 11:52.584
No, it's--it's not--
No, not bad at all.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.129
I'm gonna be right back.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.419
- She's a chick.
- No.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.755
- You're saying that--
- Dov, she's not a chick. She's a man.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.009
I'm not a man.
I'm transgendered.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.266
Can you please explain to us
exactly what that means?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.431
I mean, if--if you're a dude,
I could search you.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.893
And if not, Gail would be delighted.

12:13.942 --> 12:17.275
You search her. You book her.
It's not rocket science.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.312
It's some kind of science. Sorry.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.524
Got a wallet?

12:29.624 --> 12:30.784
Ah.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.955
Tabor Barnes. "M" for male.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.960
I'm sorry, sir.
I just haven't updated it.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.464
Epstein, you're up.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.339
Okay.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.838
(sirens wailing)

12:46.891 --> 12:49.132
(indistinct police radio chatter)

12:49.477 --> 12:50.933
Go ahead. Contain the perimeter.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.598
What about the people inside?
They're all possible witnesses.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.140
- So contain 'em. Don't let 'em out.
- Should I start taking statements?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.936
Yeah, sure.
You can start by taking mine.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.526
You ready? Here it is.
Put up the tape. Sit on your radio.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.486
(man on radio) 1509. We got some movement
in the bushes back here.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.734
Oh, hey. Thanks forjoining.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.824
- We were looking for the shooter, but we--
- Shut it.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.580
We were looking for the shooter.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.740
(woman paramedic)
Thought she wasn't breathing.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.749
She wasn't, but I gave her mouth-to-mouth.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.751
- Ew.
- Let's get Courtney Love out of here,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.333
'cause the guy in there
is not going anywhere.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.043
You sure? I got healing powers.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.923
That's what I hear.
Kiss it better. Kiss it better.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.090
According to our friend Sadie here,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.505
victim's name is Mink Barker--
well-known drug dealer.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.924
Came in with a friend.
Right now that's our suspect.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.060
He's a white male,
greasy black hair, black t-shirt,

13:34.105 --> 13:35.686
and he is probably long gone.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.481
McNally, Nash, we need you guys
to clear the rest of the house.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.357
No one leaves.
Contain the premises.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.985
- Okay.
- Yeah, be careful. Don't get lost.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.107
Go. Go.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.287
So what, we just--
we start lookin'?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.994
Yeah, start at the top,
work our way down.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.872
And, uh, shooter could still be
in the building, so guns drawn.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.787
Fake it till you make it.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.802
Uh... you scared?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.508
No. Are you?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.033
- (man, within) Hey...
- Police! Open up!

14:35.750 --> 14:38.617
(men continue speaking indistinctly)

14:40.129 --> 14:41.665
That is a crappy lock.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.375
Don't move. Put your hands up.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.916
I said don't move!
Stay where you are!

14:46.969 --> 14:50.382
- See ya.
- No, I... Stop!

14:50.431 --> 14:51.546
Here we go.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.468
You...

14:55.853 --> 14:58.265

14:58.856 --> 15:00.016

15:01.275 --> 15:03.186
Uh, Andy McNally.
I'm on the third floor.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.898
I've got two guys running down
the first escape.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.233
Uh, one of them matches
the subject's description.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.943
Anybody on the ground?
Traci!

15:12.286 --> 15:13.662
Oh!

15:14.664 --> 15:16.905
Guys, I'm running down
the fire escape.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.450
I'm in pursuit of a suspect--
black t-shirt, greasy hair.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.091
(tires screech)

15:26.134 --> 15:27.419
Sir, this is a crime scene.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.708
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn this thing around...

15:30.430 --> 15:32.091
- Detective.
- Homicide.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.550
Help yourself.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.930
Andy?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.140
Dude?

15:40.982 --> 15:42.142
Where are you?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.439
(clatter)

15:44.485 --> 15:45.691
Andy?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.694
(under breath) Okay,

16:11.762 --> 16:13.047
Backup. 352 Dunn.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.383
(man)
What was I supposed to do?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.890
(man speaking indistinctly)

16:17.935 --> 16:19.675
Okay, okay, all right, calm down.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.481
Police! Don't move!

16:22.523 --> 16:23.683
Hurry up! Now!

16:25.067 --> 16:26.603
Put 'em against the fence, both of you.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.643
Aw, come on.
| don't--| don't believe this.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.936
Sir, be quiet.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.659
(grunts) Oh! Aah!

16:44.712 --> 16:46.998
Don't move!
Get back to the fence right now!

16:47.048 --> 16:48.163
You don't want to do this.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.207
Shut up. Turn over.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.089
I'm serious.
You gotta trust me, okay?

16:54.138 --> 16:55.173
No, I'm serious. You shut up.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.179
Resisting arrest.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.256
- Fleeing the scene.
- Ohh.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.096
(groans)

17:04.398 --> 17:05.387
Oh.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.558
Possession.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.279
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Where's the gun, huh?

17:14.325 --> 17:17.817
I don't have a gun.
I'm on thejob.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.986
Not anymore. Get up.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.745

- Aah. That hurts.

17:21.791 --> 17:22.871
Go.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.327
Let's go.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.957
Okay, okay. Thank you.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.934
(indistinct conversations,
dog barking)

17:47.942 --> 17:49.773
Sir.
I've been trying to radio you.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.979
Yeah? Here, turn around.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.228
Ah, see? Try turning it on.
(radio beeps)

17:53.281 --> 17:55.567
(indistinct police radio chatter)

17:55.616 --> 17:57.777
Listen, I've made a couple of arrests.
They're in the back of the car.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.158
Arrests?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.784
- Yeah.
- For what?

18:00.830 --> 18:04.448
Fleeing the scene. Possession.
One guy matches the subject description.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.119
Really? (chuckles) Okay.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.213
Yeah, let's get 'em back
to the barn, yeah.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.548
l'm starving.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.552
Uh, you know, because you said
don't let anybody leave the scene--

18:17.597 --> 18:19.838
I know what I said.
What do you want, a cookie?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.762
(man on radio)
1503, do you copy?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.099
Amazing.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.437
- What?
- Nothing.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.272
No, that's--that's--that's good work.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.229
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.490
Let's book these bad boys.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.776
You know, ljust got out
of ladies' prison.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.615
You're the first man
that I've touched in three months.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.746
Diaz, meet Sadie Falls.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.207
She's a witness.
She just got out of prison.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.956
Take her statement
and search her.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.166
Yes, sir. Will do.
Okay, ma'am. Come with me.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.797
Okay.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.291
Well, he doesn't live here--
not a chance.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.508
Look at his running shoes--
top of the line. 150 bucks easy.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.677
Calling Children's Aid.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.012
You better start talking, young man.

19:07.396 --> 19:11.059
Okay, Joe, you gotta start
talking to me, okay?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.057
I can't.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.067
How come?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.363
I promised.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.729
You promised who?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.527
You can tell me.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.793
l was playing a game.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.793
- Mm-hmm.
- And in the game,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.500
you're su-- you're supposed
to stay in the closet

19:35.549 --> 19:37.130
until he comes and finds you.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.918
Until who comes and finds you?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.433
Are you saying you saw a different guy
come into the apartment?

19:48.479 --> 19:52.518
No, I'm saying that I'm not
gonna tell you anything else

19:52.566 --> 19:54.352
until you promise to help me out here.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.687
Ma'am, according
to the criminal code,

19:55.736 --> 19:58.773
you are under legal obligations
to report everything you saw in there.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.609
You are adorable.

20:00.658 --> 20:04.992
Hey, Frank.
(chuckles) Frank?

20:05.746 --> 20:06.826
What's the problem?

20:06.872 --> 20:10.410
No, it'sjust I can't, like,
make a deal with a rookie.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.996
So make a deal with me.
Tell me what you saw. No harm, no foul.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.501
You're not gonna write me up, hmm?

20:15.715 --> 20:16.875
Okay.

20:18.592 --> 20:22.084
Kid came in. He was looking for Mink.
He was real pissed off.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.630
He was a, uh, uh, a skinny guy,

20:25.683 --> 20:28.925
um, brown hair, orange t-shirt.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.811
About five minutes later,
the gun went off.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.888
l was in the other room.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.353
Sweetie, I swear to God,
I didn't see what happened.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.063
- I didn't see what happened, I swear.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.319
But, sir, the manual says you have to--

20:40.364 --> 20:42.776
"But, sir, the manual says..."
Listen--

20:42.825 --> 20:45.532
- She was withholding evidence.
- Yeah, from you.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.661
Look, rook, sometimes you gotta
give a little to get a little, all right?

20:48.706 --> 20:51.618
All right.
Give him the statement.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.168
I can ID. the guy.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.456
Let's get these guys processed.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.505
Now, McNally, you got that guy.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.138
Come on. Let's go. Move it.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.763
Good stuff. Good stuff.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.679
Okay. I am gonna get this guy
into a holding cell.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.313
- Don't we have to book him first?
- Yeah, usually.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.440
That's cool, officers.
I'll take it from here. Nice work.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.192
You know what's not cool?
I said that I got him.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.443
- No, |--
- Uh, where's Jeff?

21:21.489 --> 21:22.524
Who the hell are you?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.438
Hey, Sam. Buddy.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.108
I can't believe the drug squad's
giving you back.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.321
Welcome home.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.122
I mean, 'cause I haven't--

21:33.167 --> 21:35.749
I haven't seen you here
since I put you away.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.168
You're a cop?
Are you serious?

21:41.217 --> 21:43.754
- No. Shut up.
- What the hell is he doing here?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.418
l was trying to get him into a holding cell.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.302
Maybe a little heads-up would be in order.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.337
(all speaking at once)

21:48.390 --> 21:50.767
- How could you?
- Shut up! Everybody, shut up.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.812
Sorry, buddy. Sorry.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.437
(door buzzes and beeps)

22:01.195 --> 22:03.356
(door creaks closed)

22:05.074 --> 22:07.406
- Sam, I'm so sorry.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.409
(laughs) What do you think?
I'm standing there dressed like a punk.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.241
I'm in cuffs. Many would assume
I'm still undercover.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.281
Sir, it was my fault.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.825
She's a rook. She's not supposed
to be running around on her own.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.914
Sam, I know.
It got kinda stretched out.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.170
| asked her to clear the house.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.877
And he matched the description.
| arrested him, but I didn't know.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.668
|--| told you, "Don't do this.
You're makin' a mistake."

22:26.720 --> 22:28.585
Okay, well, everybody says that, don't they?

22:28.639 --> 22:29.628
Is that what they say?

22:30.808 --> 22:32.514
Why didn't you just tell me
you were working undercover?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.551
I told you l was on the job.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.343
I couldn't exactly break it down for you.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.479
My guy was right there--
biggest mouth on the street,

22:38.524 --> 22:39.809
which is why he's my guy.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.776
Eight months.
Eight months undercover,

22:43.821 --> 22:45.686
living in a hole, cultivating informants...

22:45.739 --> 22:47.775
- Okay, well, I'm sorry for being new, okay?
- Finally getting people--

22:47.825 --> 22:49.156
Finally getting people to talk to me,

22:49.285 --> 22:52.698
and some Bambi comes along first day,
arrests a cop from her own division,

22:52.746 --> 22:54.156
trying to be a hero.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.409
Thanks, pal. Friends forever.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.638
All right, little man.
You see this quarter?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.641
If you can guess what hand it's in,
you can keep it.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.052
But be careful. I'm a magician.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.641
No, I'm telling you, I've got a key.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.851
It's one of those fancy keys
at 60 bucks a pop.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.687
Can't get 'em duplicated without a code.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.728
In... my... sleeve.
(coin clatters)

23:27.031 --> 23:29.738
No, I don't have the code,
but there's a number on the key. It...

23:31.368 --> 23:34.155
Okay--
Buddy, look at your caller ID.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.445
Yeah, it says "police."
Do you want to know why?

23:36.498 --> 23:39.661
'cause I'm the frickin' police,
and I'm telling you that I need an address.

23:41.962 --> 23:42.997
Booking's that way.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.129
Uh, she's a witness to a homicide

23:45.174 --> 23:48.382
who has definitely not breached probation.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.385
We, uh, you still need to search her...

23:52.222 --> 23:53.211
carefully.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.254
You can search me.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.300
Oh, and, uh, Frank says
to make her cough.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.891
You know, just in case she's got, um,

24:01.482 --> 24:04.645
drugs
up the... the ying-yang.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.440
I am the frickin' police,

24:08.489 --> 24:11.481
and l have an address for Joe!

24:11.742 --> 24:13.573
- (man f '
, aIntly Y
-Yes!) ay-

24:19.833 --> 24:21.369
Is that working for you, huh?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.750
All the slamming and banging?
I mean, I get your point.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.913
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm being persistent.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.581
You know, I have nothing else
going for me today,

24:28.634 --> 24:29.669
so, you know, when in doubt...

24:29.718 --> 24:31.174
I don't like Girl Guides.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.587
I don't like being raked over coals
for not knowing the secret handshake.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.590
You know, console yourself.
I'll probably be fired.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.931
You know what? There's still
a dead guy lying in that house.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.972
Oh, and there's another guy
running free and clear with a gun.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.561
So whenever you feel
like this is out of your system,

24:46.610 --> 24:49.067
maybe you'd care to act
like a cop for five minutes.

24:49.113 --> 24:52.697
(laughing)
You've only been a cop for five minutes.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.361
What do you know?

24:55.411 --> 24:56.617
(objects clattering)

24:56.662 --> 24:57.822
What do you got?

24:57.871 --> 24:59.452
Victim's name is Mink Barker.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.535
Whoo! Mink Barker.
If it's Mink Barker, happy birthday.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.075
It was a big surprise.
King of bad dope. King of pain.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.586
You got half a neighborhood
who'd love to see the creep dead.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.837
Guy's a sleazebag.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.124
Deals--deals a ton ofjunk
at street level, none of it's good.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.838
Hold on a sec.
There's good junk?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.264
Yeah, there's heroin that hasn't
been cut with rat poison,

25:16.306 --> 25:18.433
cut glass, other drugs, you name it.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.384
We've had seven O.D.s in three weeks.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.974
It's all Barker's stuff.
Now he's dead. Karma's a bitch.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.309
Okay. So then what about the gunman?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.894
I mean, apparently he came in
with some other guy--

25:27.943 --> 25:30.605
you know, greasy black hair.
That's why I thought it was you.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.396
(sighs) That's Mike Kowalchuk.
He's a weasel,

25:33.449 --> 25:35.314
but he doesn't have a gun
and he doesn't have the balls,

25:35.367 --> 25:37.073
and this is gel, by the way.

25:37.828 --> 25:42.697
So, uh, what about the kid
in the orange t-shirt?

25:44.126 --> 25:45.536
I don't know who you're talking about.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.542
Heard the shots, looked out the window,

25:47.588 --> 25:52.002
saw a couple of kids taking off
down the fire escape.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.884
One of 'em ran into an empty building.
It's a good place to hide a gun.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.134
Okay, which empty building?

25:56.180 --> 25:58.887
You know, the one right near where
you tackled me, tried to kiss me.

25:58.932 --> 25:59.921
(scoffs, laughing)

25:59.975 --> 26:01.090
Did you guys find the gun?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.134
(sighs) Did you even look for a gun?

26:05.147 --> 26:07.388
Well, if you saw the kid take off,
why didn't you chase after him?

26:07.441 --> 26:10.604
(sighs)
Lady, l was playing a drug addict.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.064
Couldn't go down and chase him
without blowing my cover.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.853
Not like it matters now.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.022
Do you mind?

26:22.498 --> 26:24.739
Hey, we need to go back
to the house.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.407
(mouth full) We don't need
to do anything, okay?

26:26.460 --> 26:28.667
I don't even want to have
the talk anymore.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.088
Yeah, but I just got
some more information,

26:30.130 --> 26:31.540
and we need to relay it to homicide.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.926
I talked to the undercover guy.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.550
(chuckles)

26:37.596 --> 26:38.676
Fine.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.722
You drive. l'll digest.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.598
Okay.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.550
Dude...

26:45.604 --> 26:47.765
it's "probation" with an "o"...

26:47.815 --> 26:49.305
(clicks computer key)
...not "pra-bation."

26:49.358 --> 26:50.473
(typing)

26:50.526 --> 26:53.188
How was I supposed to know
you're allowed to make a deal with a junkie?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.649
Uh, rock, paper, scissors--
homicide trumps all.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.948
Now we know.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.073
I swear to God it takes 15 minutes to pee
with this thing on.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.828
W-where's Joe?

27:08.794 --> 27:11.126
(man) Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.877
Well, you need to fire that babysitter.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.796
Yeah, yeah, I already did.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.252
I left her, like, ten messages.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.463
Babysitter's a "her"?

27:21.390 --> 27:22.971
Excuse me?

27:23.016 --> 27:25.348
Well, it's just that's what
Joe kept saying--

27:26.603 --> 27:28.639
"Now how's he gonna find me?"

27:29.940 --> 27:31.976
He says it's a game you guys play.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.641
He said that?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.229
I mean, 'cause that's a hell of a game--

27:36.363 --> 27:38.570
leaving your 8-year-old kid in a closet...

27:39.116 --> 27:40.481
in a crack house....

27:41.118 --> 27:42.198
after a homicide.

27:42.244 --> 27:46.578
Look, I told you...
He was with his sitter.

27:46.623 --> 27:50.115
Yeah, I'm just gonna give her a call
before you leave.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.579
Just make sure your stories line up.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.666
Joe, you want to, uh,
just take a seat for a second?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.379
How long have you been using?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.294
What? (scoffs)

28:02.389 --> 28:04.880
Sir, the officer asked you a question.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.048
I heard the question.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.467
Honestly, I don't know
what you're talking about, okay?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.851
Really?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.354
Hmm.
Number's out of service.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.481
(whispers) All right, all right.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.188
If I put myself there,

28:17.237 --> 28:18.943
right where you are,

28:19.948 --> 28:21.734
| get it. You know, I do.

28:22.451 --> 28:25.443
But what I do not get is how you left him.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.491
I mean, you just left him there alone.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.575
I didn't.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.378
|--| didn't leave him alone. I, uh...

28:37.966 --> 28:39.251
I went back three times.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.885
The place was closed off.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.968
|,uh”.huh,

28:47.017 --> 28:48.598
I couldn't get in.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.268
Yeah.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.604
Sir, you should go talk to your son.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.911
(man whispers) I'm so sorry.

29:08.789 --> 29:12.281
According to Swarek,
it's not Mike Kowalchuk why?

29:12.334 --> 29:16.953
Uh, he said, "Because he's a weasel,
but he doesn't have the balls or a gun."

29:17.631 --> 29:18.791
And Swarek was up there?

29:19.091 --> 29:22.208
Yeah, he was on the third floor
and said he saw a guy in an orange shirt

29:22.261 --> 29:24.217
run down the fire escape
and go into the building over there.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.298
You know, I can go take a look right now.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.306
If you find anything, don't touch it, huh?

29:29.351 --> 29:31.182
Just call me. I'll send in forensics.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.263
Okay.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.391
- l'll walk you.
- All right.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.358
I hear you arrested him.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.687
Sam Swarek? Yeah, I did.
I feel like an idiot.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.725
It's not your fault.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.644
Another context,
it's actually pretty impressive.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.238
- Luke Callaghan.
- Andy McNally.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.824
Um, yeah, my dad
worked homicide, too.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.952
So you work out of headquarters?

29:50.998 --> 29:53.740
No, I'm the lead investigator
on the Zoe Martinelli task force,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.248
- have been for two years.
- Cool.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.127
She was a rookie cop killed in 15,
so I work out of 15.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.045
Oh. So I guess I'll see you.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.458
I mean, |'||--|'|| definitely see you
if I find anything.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.718
Um, actually,
I'll probably be right back.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.507
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.099
Ooh.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.806
(self-mocking)
"So I guess I'll see you."

30:17.941 --> 30:19.272
Okay.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.524
(dog barking)

30:35.667 --> 30:38.044
(clatter)

30:40.047 --> 30:42.038
(clatter)

31:15.999 --> 31:19.457
(pigeons cooing)

31:22.255 --> 31:24.871
(glass shatters)
Ow! God!

31:24.925 --> 31:26.210
(inhales sharply)

31:26.259 --> 31:28.250
Oh!

31:30.097 --> 31:32.053
(whispers) Oh, crap.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.556
(children shouting in distance)

31:34.601 --> 31:38.389
Oh! (inhales sharply)

31:38.438 --> 31:40.724
Don't move!

31:49.825 --> 31:50.905
Oka--hi.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.031
- I said don't move!
- I know.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.442
- All right, put your hands in the air.
- All right.

31:53.495 --> 31:54.905
- And get down on the ground!
- All right.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.365
Come on. Okay.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.531
Wow, you'd make a really good cop.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.793
- Reach down and take out the cuffs.
- Okay.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.958
Come on! Take them out!
Take them out! Put them on!

32:06.007 --> 32:07.508
- Cuff yourself! Come on!
- Okay! All right.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.387
(handcuffs clank, then click shut)

32:13.432 --> 32:15.593
Why don't you just tell me
what your name is, okay?

32:15.642 --> 32:17.257
What you doing with that gun?

32:17.310 --> 32:19.642
|--| found it.
lt--it was here, okay?

32:19.855 --> 32:23.063
Yeah, I know.
I came in here to look for it.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.348
(man on radio)
McNally, what's your 20?

32:24.401 --> 32:27.188
- I said don't move!
- Okay! Sorry, it's a habit, all right?

32:27.237 --> 32:28.818
Well, it's not really a habit yet
'cause I'm new,

32:28.864 --> 32:32.698
but I'm trying to make it a habit,
‘cause it's--it's important, so...

32:32.742 --> 32:34.607
I'm gonna get a few shots in here.
Why don't you go upstairs

32:34.661 --> 32:36.276
and get some shots
out that second-floor window?

32:36.329 --> 32:37.318
- Hey, Luke?
- Yeah?

32:37.372 --> 32:38.987
Have you seen my rookie?
She's not answering her radio.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.746
Go easy on her. It's her first day.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.495
Yeah. McNally, what's your 20?

32:44.045 --> 32:45.546
She's outside, looking for evidence.

32:45.589 --> 32:46.954
Aw, come on, pal.
You think that's for real?

32:47.007 --> 32:48.338
Swarek's really pissed off.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.419
That's a payback goose chase
if I've ever seen one.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.300
Well, that's where she is.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.961
(sighs)
Well, you know where I am.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.130
Listen, um...

33:00.145 --> 33:01.351
Tell me why you, uh...

33:01.396 --> 33:04.854
you shot the guy in the--
in the other room, huh?

33:05.025 --> 33:07.311
What, you were--
you were in there?

33:07.360 --> 33:09.521
- Yeah.
- You and who else?

33:09.571 --> 33:11.562
Uh, there was, um,
my--my training officer

33:11.615 --> 33:13.856
and a-a prostitute, um...

33:14.367 --> 33:16.232
There was a girl on the floor.
She was overdosing.

33:16.745 --> 33:20.158
- Uh... a couple... other people.
- What happened to her?

33:21.291 --> 33:23.623
What happened to the... (gulps)

33:23.668 --> 33:24.703
girl on the floor?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.836
She's okay. She's okay.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.623
She's, um, she's breathing. She didn't die.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.008
She's at the hospital right now.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.092
Hey, I wouldn't even think about running, okay?
There's a lot of cops out there.

33:38.934 --> 33:42.893
Okay? So why don't you just
tell me what happened, okay?

33:43.271 --> 33:48.140
You can't be... can't be 18,
so everything is gonna be fine.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.980
You're gonna be okay.
I can help you. All right?

33:51.655 --> 33:54.192
- Hey, I told you to stay down! All right?
- All right. All right.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.072
(breathing hard)

33:56.117 --> 33:57.573
(handcuffs click open)

33:57.619 --> 33:59.450
Don't move!
All right, please don't move.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.486
Any sudden movements,
and I gotta pull the trigger.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.575
That's procedure.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.489
Actually, technically,
I should have done it already.

34:05.835 --> 34:09.327
Come on. Just please
put the gun down, okay? Slowly.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.962
Put the gun down.
Come on, man!

34:11.007 --> 34:12.417
Okay, please don't make me shoot you.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.879
This is my first day.
I'm begging you, please.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.089
Come on. Come on.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.423
I'm begging you.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.511
Come on. I can help you, okay?

34:22.269 --> 34:23.429
(breathing hard) Just put it down.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.060
(whispers) Come on.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.438
- (crying) She's 15
-VVho? I

34:29.234 --> 34:30.269
My sister.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.609
The--the girl inside.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.146
- And she was just laying there.
- Yeah.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.239
And she wasn't moving.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.866
Okay, okay.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.117
It all happened so fast.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.743
- That guy--the--
- What guy?

34:42.789 --> 34:44.905
What guy? The drug dealer?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.033
I thought she was dead.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.587
I kept asking him,

34:50.213 --> 34:52.295
"Wh-what happened?
Tell me what she took."

34:54.968 --> 34:57.880
Then hejust laughed like it was funny.
Hesmdm

34:59.139 --> 35:01.471
He said it was her fault,
said he was leaving her there.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.474
Leaving her there on the floor
like a piece of garbage!

35:04.686 --> 35:07.302
I know. And you- -and you stopped him
from leaving, right?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.637
And then you came in here
and you hid the gun.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.524
And you just came back
for the gun, right?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.478
(sobbing)
I didn't mean to do it.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.398
I know. Come on.
I'm sorry, man.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.992
It's okay. I'm sorry.
I gotta do this, though, all right?

35:25.206 --> 35:26.195
(whispers) It's okay.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.742
(handcuffs click)

35:30.003 --> 35:31.209
Okay.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.370
(exhales) Okay.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.339
(exhales deeply) Okay.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.675
Let's go, okay?

35:41.139 --> 35:44.097
(Great Lake Swimmers'
"There is a Light" playing)

35:48.605 --> 35:54.020
.l‘ There's a light in you .l‘

35:54.986 --> 36:00.356
.l‘ l have fallen into .l‘

36:01.534 --> 36:07.404
.l‘ There is a light in you .l‘

36:10.126 --> 36:13.209
.l‘ I've fallen into .l‘

36:13.588 --> 36:17.046
.l‘ fallen into .l‘

36:25.725 --> 36:29.092
I called the hospital and, uh...
that guy's little sister--she made it.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.807
Good. Good, that's great.
Yeah, you should probably tell him.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.598
Yeah. No, what's great is
that her bloodwork is clear.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.358
- All right, you still have to get tested, okay?
- Yeah.

36:37.404 --> 36:40.237
Well, |, uh, I used to work
with a guy named McNally.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.865
Uh, long time ago.
He was my training officer for a while,

36:43.910 --> 36:46.196
but he... kind of...

36:46.246 --> 36:49.204
l... Well, I heard that he hit a rough patch
a while back,

36:52.252 --> 36:53.867
Yeah, he is.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.663
Yeah, anyway,
I just wanted to say that, uh...

36:58.383 --> 37:01.250
"fresh paint" line from before?
That was his.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.343
I don't know if he got it from a book or...

37:04.389 --> 37:06.425
Well, either way, it was his first.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.010
ljust, uh...

37:09.644 --> 37:11.430
I don't know. ljust--
| always liked it, you know?

37:11.479 --> 37:12.855
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.307
- Hey, Luke? (knocks on door)
- Yeah.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.273
- Okay.
- Thanks.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.024
Hi.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.187
- Quite a day.
- Yeah.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.114
This is the second of...

37:28.163 --> 37:29.744
- 20.
- Four or five.

37:29.789 --> 37:30.778
20? Okay.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.743
- And one more, please?
- (woman) Coming up.

37:32.792 --> 37:33.827
Officer.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.576
Detective.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.329
Let me know when you're leaving.
l'll drive you home.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.966
Uh, thank you,
but, uh, I got plans tonight.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.554
Hey.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.184
Thanks for the tip today.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.677
Worked out pretty good.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.265
Yeah. So can I buy you a drink
to say thank you

37:58.318 --> 37:59.683
or apologize?

38:00.487 --> 38:01.897
Anton Hill--
you know who he is?

38:02.197 --> 38:03.437
No.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.445
70% of the heroin that comes into this city
comes through Anton,

38:07.494 --> 38:09.780
when he's not pimping
little girls for fun.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.658
l was undercover eight months.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.334
l was two weeks away
from arresting the guy.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.953
I'm glad you got your collar,
but I think I'll buy my own drinks tonight.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.456
(whispers) Okay.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.499
(Chris) Traci found the kid.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.464
Hey, another day, another dirtbag.
What is it Boyko was saying?

38:27.514 --> 38:30.096
Um... Serve, protect, and--

38:30.141 --> 38:31.551
and don't screw up.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.062
How was I supposed to know
he's undercover, huh?

38:35.355 --> 38:38.267
I mean, it's a compliment, really. Isn't it?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.435
(Dov) Who cares?
You caught that kid.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.816
You brought him out all by yourself.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.692
Handcuffs, murder weapon?

38:44.531 --> 38:45.611
Rock 'n' roll, McNally.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.694
(all) Yeah, right?

38:48.743 --> 38:50.483
(Traci imitating Andy)
"Yeah, Traci, it's our first day.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.448
"We don't have to do anything but sit there.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.283
- They'll just drive us around."
- Would you shut up?

38:54.332 --> 38:59.417
.l‘ When the days form all this maze .l‘

38:59.462 --> 39:02.670
.l‘ of information there .l‘

39:02.715 --> 39:08.005
J‘ For the days of no days .l‘

39:08.054 --> 39:13.014
.l‘ And the cars all speed up and... .l‘

39:19.232 --> 39:22.019
27...

39:22.068 --> 39:24.605
26...

39:24.654 --> 39:26.861
25...

39:26.906 --> 39:29.648
Six...

39:29.701 --> 39:32.317
Five...

39:32.370 --> 39:34.406
Founu

39:34.455 --> 39:36.537
Three...

39:36.583 --> 39:38.198
Two...

39:38.251 --> 39:39.707
- One!
- Zero minutes.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.253
(laughing) Hi!

39:41.504 --> 39:43.290
Hello, my...

39:43.715 --> 39:46.673
Mmm. (kiss) Mmm.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.310
- Dad, hey.
- Hey.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.066
(sniffs) So? How was it?

40:06.112 --> 40:08.228
(sighs) It was good.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.942
It was... terrible.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.778
I don't know. I don't know.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.200
You gonna be...
You gonna be okay?

40:16.664 --> 40:19.451
Oh, yeah. I'll be fine.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.834
(inhales deeply)
Ah, first days are always the best.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.629
New boots, new badge.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.632
Whole world smells like fresh paint, and...

40:29.677 --> 40:32.339
you've been set on Earth to keep it that way.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.933
Thought it was the rookies
that smelled like fresh paint.

40:35.975 --> 40:40.969
Ah, you're gonna be fine
'cause you're the real deal,

40:42.023 --> 40:44.856
unlike your old man,
who's a total catastrophe.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.067
I've been, uh...

40:49.155 --> 40:50.895
saving something for you.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.359
(whispers) Dad.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.866
(sighs)
Keep it in the family.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.528
You remember...

40:59.582 --> 41:02.995
You're Andy McNally,
and you're gonna be great.
