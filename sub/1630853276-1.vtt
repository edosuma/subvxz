[door closes]

00:51.536 --> 00:55.149
[quiet indistinct chatter]

00:55.279 --> 00:56.367
Hey now, friend.

01:02.504 --> 01:04.636
Can I get you something?

01:04.767 --> 01:06.203
Not yet.

01:16.822 --> 01:19.390
[sniffing]

01:19.521 --> 01:20.522
[swallowing]

01:20.652 --> 01:21.479
[sets down glass]

01:21.610 --> 01:23.090
[sighing]

01:31.663 --> 01:34.666
You're Joe Grant,
aren't you?

01:34.797 --> 01:36.407
Sure am.

01:38.496 --> 01:40.585
Tell me you're looking
out for someone?

01:40.716 --> 01:42.196
That's right.

01:45.982 --> 01:48.506
That's a fine-looking gun,
Joe.

01:48.637 --> 01:50.291
You mind if I take a look?

01:52.510 --> 01:53.598
[grunts]

[glass clatters]

02:11.703 --> 02:13.314
Thanks.

02:13.444 --> 02:16.447
She's a real beauty.

02:16.578 --> 02:17.622
[sighs]

02:17.753 --> 02:19.146
So, tell me...

02:20.495 --> 02:22.453
What's this fellow's name?

02:22.584 --> 02:24.586
He's got several names--

02:24.716 --> 02:28.677
William H. Bonney,
Kid Antrim...

02:28.807 --> 02:31.288
...and Billy the Kid.

02:33.595 --> 02:35.292
Know what he looks like?

02:37.773 --> 02:41.690
Well, they say he dresses
kinda funny.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.692
Funny?

02:43.822 --> 02:46.695
[exhales]

02:46.825 --> 02:49.437
[suspenseful music]

02:51.961 --> 02:53.702
I mean... unusual.

02:58.794 --> 03:01.666
[dramatic music]

03:01.797 --> 03:04.713
[chair clatters]

03:04.843 --> 03:09.457
Now, listen, Joe.

03:09.587 --> 03:12.895
I've never done
anything against you,

03:13.025 --> 03:15.463
and I don't want to.

03:17.769 --> 03:20.903
-You don't stand a chance.
-Please, Joe.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.645
Believe me, I really do
not want to kill you.

03:25.864 --> 03:26.691
[gun hammer clicks]

03:29.955 --> 03:34.351
Still have a chance, Joe,
to save your life.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.570
Take it.

03:38.964 --> 03:41.532
[gun cocks]

03:43.186 --> 03:46.755
What do you think,
that I'm stupid?

03:50.019 --> 03:51.716
[hammer clicks]

03:54.806 --> 03:56.765
[dramatic music]

03:56.895 --> 03:58.680
[gun cocks, fires]

03:58.810 --> 04:01.639
[theme music]

04:12.650 --> 04:13.912
[man] Hey, kid,
what's happening?

04:14.043 --> 04:16.698
Not much, Bryan.

04:16.828 --> 04:18.830
-[man] Slow down, kid.
-Sorry, Joseph!

04:18.961 --> 04:21.659
[indistinct chatter
in multiple languages]

04:31.365 --> 04:33.541
-Hey, Mrs. Lam.
-[speaks in Mandarin]

04:41.592 --> 04:44.116
[laughter]

04:44.247 --> 04:45.683
-[man] Here he is.
-[man 2] Yay!

04:45.814 --> 04:47.772
[laughter]

04:47.903 --> 04:50.949
Happy birthday to you, Billy!
[laughing]

04:51.080 --> 04:53.822
Here you go, son.
This is all for you.

04:53.952 --> 04:56.651
Thank you, Pa.
Where's Ma?

04:56.781 --> 04:58.609
-Here I am!
-[laughs]

04:58.740 --> 04:59.915
-Happy birthday, Billy.
-[Billy] Thank you, Joe.

05:00.045 --> 05:02.744
[laughter]

05:02.874 --> 05:05.877
I adore you and all
that you are, Billy...

05:06.008 --> 05:07.096
[whispering] Each and every day
of my life.

05:07.226 --> 05:09.794
Today is no different.

05:11.883 --> 05:15.060
So, Paddy, any luck
finding a new job?

05:15.191 --> 05:18.716
No. But I hear there's
a contractor called Roth

05:18.847 --> 05:20.283
hiring men down at the docks.

05:20.414 --> 05:22.198
[Frank] We've all heard
that one, Paddy.

05:22.329 --> 05:24.069
Doesn't mean it's true.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.637
There's bound to be something.

05:26.768 --> 05:28.770
Sure, this is one big,
busy city.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.032
Jesus.

05:30.162 --> 05:32.034
Well, I've been looking
for a while now.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.906
And the truth is, they don't
want us immigrants here.

05:35.037 --> 05:36.255
Even us Irish.

05:36.386 --> 05:37.909
[Mary]
Frank, won't you stop that?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.998
Remember what it was like
back home?

05:40.129 --> 05:44.089
I'll never forget it, Mary.
But here's no different.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.048
The powers-that-be have decided
the city's full up,

05:46.178 --> 05:47.876
and we have to move on.

05:48.006 --> 05:50.835
Sure, don't you know
that yourself?

05:50.966 --> 05:52.359
Look...

05:52.489 --> 05:56.798
I found this advertisement
on the street.

05:56.928 --> 05:59.017
It says there's plenty
of jobs out west.

05:59.148 --> 06:02.586
"The Land of Opportunity.

06:02.717 --> 06:05.197
Wanted--healthy men and women

06:05.328 --> 06:08.723
who want to work hard
and succeed in life."

06:11.987 --> 06:13.902
I don't know.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.950
[Kathleen] What is it
you don't know, Paddy?

06:19.081 --> 06:21.997
[Paddy] New York's full
of Irish people, just like us.

06:22.127 --> 06:24.739
We don't even know
what the West is,

06:24.869 --> 06:25.957
what kind of people
are out there.

06:26.088 --> 06:28.743
Paddy, you can bet
your bottom fucking dollar

06:28.873 --> 06:30.701
that wherever this is...

06:30.832 --> 06:32.790
sure,
the Irish'll be there already.

06:32.921 --> 06:38.796
[laughter]

06:38.927 --> 06:41.582
[screaming in distance]

06:45.107 --> 06:46.587
Are ya asleep?

06:48.893 --> 06:49.851
No.

06:51.896 --> 06:53.768
No, I can't sleep.

06:57.424 --> 06:58.990
Frank said that he and Mary

06:59.121 --> 07:03.081
have almost decided
to leave and go west,

07:03.212 --> 07:05.257
given up hope here.

07:05.388 --> 07:08.478
Where are they going?

07:08.609 --> 07:13.048
[Kathleen] I don't know.
A place called Kansas, I think.

07:18.183 --> 07:19.794
You think we should
go with them?

07:19.924 --> 07:22.840
You know what I think, Kathleen.

07:22.971 --> 07:27.149
Yes. But we could
work hard and save,

07:27.279 --> 07:29.934
buy a little place,

07:30.065 --> 07:34.112
maybe turn it into a small
boarding house and restaurant.

07:38.377 --> 07:40.162
Pat?

07:40.292 --> 07:41.990
What are you thinking?

07:46.298 --> 07:50.999
-Are you crying?
-Yeah.

07:51.129 --> 07:53.262
[Kathleen] Paddy.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.394
Pat.

07:55.525 --> 07:58.136
Now you listen here,
Patrick McCarty.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.878
We did not come all this way
to fall at the first hurdle.

08:01.009 --> 08:03.141
The good Lord'll look after us.

08:05.230 --> 08:08.756
We came over here to start
a new life, didn't we?

08:10.018 --> 08:12.150
And perhaps our new life
was meant to start

08:12.281 --> 08:14.152
right there in Kansas.

08:18.287 --> 08:20.245
[Paddy sighs]

08:20.376 --> 08:23.161
[soft music]

08:30.125 --> 08:32.170
[indistinct chatter]

08:46.054 --> 08:47.098
What are you doing, Pa?

08:51.668 --> 08:54.236
[Paddy] I'm not sure
I want to take this with us.

08:54.366 --> 08:56.934
But we're not coming back.

08:57.065 --> 09:00.024
Why wouldn't you
want to take it?

09:00.155 --> 09:01.373
Yeah, you're right.

09:01.504 --> 09:04.420
-[footsteps approaching]
-But I'd hate to lose it.

09:04.551 --> 09:06.944
I'm not sure this journey
out west is forever.

09:10.469 --> 09:12.167
Maybe we'll all be
back here soon.

09:12.297 --> 09:16.475
It just seems wrong...
to give everything up.

09:16.606 --> 09:19.217
I don't think
we're giving everything up.

09:21.568 --> 09:23.961
We're just going on a journey.

09:26.268 --> 09:29.227
[indistinct chatter
and shouting]

09:36.408 --> 09:39.194
[man] Roll up, roll up.
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:39.324 --> 09:40.761
A few seats left!

09:40.891 --> 09:43.024
[indistinct chatter continues]

09:43.154 --> 09:44.286
[thudding]

09:48.246 --> 09:52.076
[indistinct chatter,
horse whinnying]

09:52.207 --> 09:55.036
[adventurous music playing]

10:05.568 --> 10:07.831
Wee bit farther down.

10:10.355 --> 10:11.705
Frank, will you watch
the bags, will ya?

10:11.835 --> 10:13.881
[Frank] Go ahead.

10:14.011 --> 10:15.273
Paddy?

10:16.971 --> 10:18.494
Yes, sir.
You heading out west?

10:18.625 --> 10:21.149
Uh, uh, yeah, we're heading
to Coffeyville, Kansas.

10:21.279 --> 10:24.152
-A wagon'll cost you $100.
-A hundred, uh...

10:24.282 --> 10:27.155
Look, we've got two families.
We need two wagons.

10:27.285 --> 10:30.288
Maybe we can
strike up a deal.

10:30.419 --> 10:32.769
You're joking, right?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.380
Please. I...

10:35.511 --> 10:38.122
-I don't have the money.
-I'm sorry.

10:38.253 --> 10:39.689
Better move along.
There's others waiting!

10:39.820 --> 10:41.691
I'm asking for just a tiny bit
of kindness in your heart!

10:41.822 --> 10:43.171
[Kathleen] Paddy! Paddy, look,
there's loads more.

10:43.301 --> 10:45.477
Hi, uh, I just want...

10:45.608 --> 10:47.915
How much is it going to cost us
to get to Coffeyville, Kansas?

10:48.045 --> 10:50.961
My wagons for Coffeyville
will be $350.

10:51.092 --> 10:51.483
[Paddy] No, I don't have
that kind of money.

10:51.614 --> 10:54.356
[man] $350! $350!

10:54.486 --> 10:56.314
[indistinct chatter continues]

11:01.406 --> 11:04.235
[indistinct shouting continues]

11:07.543 --> 11:09.284
[man] We offer safe,
comfortable journeys

11:09.414 --> 11:12.026
to your western destination.

11:12.156 --> 11:13.201
[man whistles]

11:14.724 --> 11:17.161
Some people say
it's rude to stare.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.949
I'm not one of them.

11:24.168 --> 11:26.649
I was just wondering about
hiring a driver with one eye.

11:26.780 --> 11:30.479
Well, that's a reasonable thing
to wonder.

11:30.609 --> 11:34.048
What's your, uh, friend here
have to say about it?

11:36.267 --> 11:38.617
He won't say anything.
He can't speak.

11:38.748 --> 11:41.969
Oh. Well, that keeps
things simple, I guess.

11:48.671 --> 11:50.412
So, can you see me?

11:50.542 --> 11:54.155
I can see well enough to know
that you can't afford

11:54.285 --> 11:58.246
the drivers
your folks are talking to.

11:58.376 --> 12:00.814
[indistinct chatter continues]

12:01.858 --> 12:04.469
We want to go to some place
called Coffeyville.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.343
-You know it?
-[man] I do.

12:08.473 --> 12:11.302
-What are your terms?
-[man chuckles]

12:11.433 --> 12:15.437
Um...well, young man,
I charge $75.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.395
That's a fair price.
I don't cheat anyone.

12:17.526 --> 12:22.966
My wagons are almost
as beat up as I am,

12:23.097 --> 12:24.576
but they'll get us there.

12:24.707 --> 12:26.448
[indistinct chatter continues]

12:26.578 --> 12:30.365
-Thank you, sir.
-[man] My pleasure.

12:30.495 --> 12:32.541
[chuckles]

12:32.671 --> 12:35.239
We're headin'
to Coffeyville, Kansas.

12:35.370 --> 12:37.502
-But, sir, it's a 6-week trip.
-Not now, Billy.

12:37.633 --> 12:41.680
But, Ma, I've found our driver.
He only charges $75.

12:41.811 --> 12:43.639
[Paddy] You're charlatans,
both of you!

12:43.770 --> 12:45.554
You're fuckin' charlatans!
Doesn't make any sense!

12:45.684 --> 12:47.599
-[Kathleen] Paddy! Paddy!
-This is unbelievable.

12:47.730 --> 12:50.602
Paddy. Billy might have
found our ride.

12:50.733 --> 12:51.952
Please, Paddy.

12:52.082 --> 12:53.780
One last chance.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.261
-Where is he?
-Over there.

12:57.392 --> 12:59.611
Come on. Go. Go, go!

12:59.742 --> 13:02.179
[horse whinnying]

13:05.792 --> 13:08.795
My son says you charge $75.

13:08.925 --> 13:14.104
Your son is correct.
$75 includes, uh...

13:16.019 --> 13:18.065
...protection.

13:18.195 --> 13:22.678
We'll be travelling
with others.

13:22.809 --> 13:24.332
[Paddy] We need two wagons.

13:27.770 --> 13:30.033
We barely have $50 each.

13:30.164 --> 13:33.471
It's all I have in the world.

13:35.473 --> 13:38.476
Uh, look, I, um...

13:45.614 --> 13:51.620
All right, then.
Two wagons. $50 each.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.230
No protection.

13:53.361 --> 13:56.277
Thank you.

13:56.407 --> 13:59.497
Yeah. Yeah.

14:02.761 --> 14:05.721
[birds chirping]

14:05.852 --> 14:08.550
[hopeful music playing]

14:29.179 --> 14:32.139
[wagon wheels rattling]

14:32.269 --> 14:35.533
-[horse snorts]
-[man] Easy. Easy.

14:35.664 --> 14:38.580
[wagon wheels rattling]

15:13.876 --> 15:16.661
[horse blusters]

15:24.278 --> 15:25.583
[horse nickers]

15:28.804 --> 15:31.459
What are you looking for, Moss?

15:31.589 --> 15:34.114
Oh.

15:34.244 --> 15:37.204
Anything. Everything.

15:37.334 --> 15:40.685
See if I see
something different

15:40.816 --> 15:45.690
or a-a smudge of smoke
on the horizon there.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.866
Hoofprints on the trail,
small size.

15:47.997 --> 15:53.960
Well, uh, travelling west is
a dangerous business, Billy.

15:54.090 --> 15:56.701
[Moss] No point in denying it.
[chuckles]

15:56.832 --> 15:58.529
Just a fact.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.984
Ma?

16:20.116 --> 16:23.250
Is this here place
anything like Ireland?

16:23.380 --> 16:25.556
Maybe a little.

16:25.687 --> 16:26.949
It rains a lot in Ireland,

16:27.080 --> 16:30.605
which is why everything
is so green.

16:30.735 --> 16:34.043
In fact...
what they say in Donegal is

if you can't see the mountains,

Go to sleep now.

Of course not.

Tell me, do you feel ill,
Mr. McCarty?

30:23.350 --> 30:24.742
Depends what you mean,
Doctor.

30:24.873 --> 30:27.093
Most people would
know what I mean.

30:27.223 --> 30:31.706
They would have

You're relatively young.

But there's something.

Well, what doyou care about?

I feel ill...

30:51.682 --> 30:56.426
I feel sad most of the time,
not even sure why.

Sometimes it's hard to...

31:03.346 --> 31:08.177
I fear the wound,
in your case,

31:08.308 --> 31:14.314
is not physical
but in the mind, Mr. McCarty.

31:14.444 --> 31:18.100
I have no medicine
to prescribe to heal you.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.757
And I've seen the mind
destroy the body.

31:22.888 --> 31:28.154
Don't let this happen to you.

I can't stay here, Kathleen.
I just can't do this on me own.

32:15.984 --> 32:22.121
I understand.
Of course I do.

32:22.251 --> 32:24.253
But I'll miss you, Mary.

Don't make me feel sorry
for you, Kathleen.

You're strong.

36:46.167 --> 36:48.691
We lost almost
everything we owned

36:48.822 --> 36:51.477
on the journey from New York.
I have nothing.

36:51.607 --> 36:53.000
But I'm a hard worker,
and the fact is,

36:53.130 --> 36:56.743
the American government
encouraged us to come out here

36:56.873 --> 36:58.875
with the promise
of new jobs and opportunities.

36:59.006 --> 37:00.921
I have set my heart
on buying a place big enough

37:01.051 --> 37:03.053
to be both a restaurant
and a rooming house.

37:03.184 --> 37:04.838
[man]
What experience do you have

37:04.968 --> 37:08.972
running a restaurant or
a rooming house, Mrs. McCarty?

37:09.103 --> 37:10.887
I thought I was
coming to a new world

37:11.018 --> 37:12.889
where everyone would have
the chance for a new beginning,

37:13.020 --> 37:15.762
so long as they were
willing to work hard.

37:15.892 --> 37:18.417
Sir, I am willing to work
every hour God sends

37:18.547 --> 37:20.070
to make a business.

37:20.201 --> 37:22.595
I have a family to support,
two young children.

37:22.725 --> 37:25.815
[man] Mm. You're married.
You have a husband?

37:25.946 --> 37:28.731
What does he do?
I'm surprised he's not here.

37:28.862 --> 37:31.343
My hus--

37:35.564 --> 37:38.654
My husband is...

37:38.785 --> 37:40.047
He's sick.

37:40.177 --> 37:41.875
[man] Then he can't work?

37:42.005 --> 37:44.007
[Kathleen]
He's getting better.

37:44.138 --> 37:46.706
He'll soon be ready for work.

37:46.836 --> 37:50.753
In New York,
we read advertisements.

37:50.884 --> 37:52.886
They even said they might pay
immigrants to come west?

37:53.016 --> 37:54.496
That's the kind of thing
the government would say.

37:54.627 --> 37:57.934
It doesn't mean anything.

37:58.065 --> 38:00.197
I don't see how I can
help you, Mrs. McCarty.

38:00.328 --> 38:01.808
This is a bank.
It's not a charity.

38:01.938 --> 38:04.593
The government promised us help.
We came all the way out here--

38:04.724 --> 38:06.029
I have other appointments,
Mrs. McCarty.

38:06.160 --> 38:10.556
I don't wish to waste any more
of your valuable time.

38:22.959 --> 38:25.788
[soft music plays]

38:27.616 --> 38:29.531
[man] Young man.

38:29.662 --> 38:30.967
Hand back my pen.

38:31.098 --> 38:35.102
At once!

38:35.232 --> 38:37.583
Come on, Ma.

38:44.111 --> 38:46.896
[indistinct chatter]

39:33.247 --> 39:37.730
[Kathleen] I have things
to say, Patrick.

39:37.860 --> 39:42.256
I want you to listen.
You don't have to speak.

39:42.387 --> 39:46.042
The priest, Father O'Leary,
is coming to see you.

39:46.173 --> 39:47.870
He's praying for you.

39:52.440 --> 39:57.924
And the best news is that Billy
is starting school tomorrow.

40:03.016 --> 40:05.018
Aren't you...

40:05.148 --> 40:08.064
Aren't you even happy
about that?

40:15.202 --> 40:17.987
[breathing unsteadily]

40:22.122 --> 40:25.952
Hello, Father.
Thank you so much for coming.

40:26.082 --> 40:28.302
This is Father O'Leary, Billy.

40:28.433 --> 40:33.133
He's come
to give consolation.

40:33.263 --> 40:35.135
I'm so very sorry, Billy.

40:35.265 --> 40:38.268
All I can say is that God,
in his infinite mercy,

40:38.399 --> 40:41.620
looks after all of us.

41:04.381 --> 41:08.560
"Per sacrosanct humane

41:08.690 --> 41:16.306

41:16.437 --> 41:22.138
Paradisi portas aperiat,
et ad gaudir...

[Father O'Leary sighs]

41:26.186 --> 41:28.318
...sempiterna...

41:28.449 --> 41:31.844
...perducat."

41:38.285 --> 41:40.809
[Kathleen]
Thank you very much, Father.

41:57.260 --> 41:59.045
[Billy] Pa?

42:18.455 --> 42:21.110
[Father O'Leary]:
God of all consolation,

42:21.241 --> 42:23.199
in Your unending love and mercy,

42:23.330 --> 42:28.161
You turn the darkness of death
to the dawn of new life.

42:28.291 --> 42:31.381
Show compassion
to Your people in their sorrow.

42:31.512 --> 42:34.341
Lift us up from the darkness

42:34.471 --> 42:38.040
of grief to the peace and light
of Your presence.

42:38.171 --> 42:41.304
Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
by dying for us,

42:41.435 --> 42:43.480
conquered death,
and by rising again,

42:43.611 --> 42:45.221
...restored life.
-[eagle cries]

42:45.352 --> 42:48.181
...May we then go
forward eagerly to meet him...

42:48.311 --> 42:51.097
-[eagle crows]
-...and after our life on earth

42:51.227 --> 42:55.188
be reunited with our brothers
and sisters, where every tear...

42:55.318 --> 42:56.537
-...will be wiped away.
-[eagle cries]

42:56.668 --> 43:00.019
We ask this
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

43:00.149 --> 43:00.889
Amen.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.240
[all] Amen.

43:04.371 --> 43:08.897
Goodbye, Pa.

[dramatic music plays]

44:25.626 --> 44:30.239
Believe me.
I really don't wanna kill you.

44:30.370 --> 44:32.328
You don't stand a chance.

45:17.765 --> 45:22.596
You know, I'm going to be
blamed for poor Joe's death.

45:22.727 --> 45:26.948
But you all saw what happened.

45:27.079 --> 45:29.255
I didn't want to kill Joe.

45:29.385 --> 45:32.737
I had no reason to...

45:32.867 --> 45:37.393
except that he wanted
to kill me for the bounty.

45:37.524 --> 45:41.267
I had no grudge against him.

45:52.669 --> 45:57.065
Make sure he gets
a decent burial...

45:58.893 --> 46:02.331
...with a preacher
and everything he needs

46:02.462 --> 46:04.507
to send him on his way
to the other life.

46:12.124 --> 46:15.257
That's all I gotta say.
