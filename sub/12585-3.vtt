WEBVTT

00:32.615 --> 00:33.908
Yep.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.577
Yup.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.955
Now that Joseph is 13,

00:39.039 --> 00:41.875
I'm teaching him
the family exterminating business.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.461
I've named this little fella Joseph.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.046
To be an effective killer,

00:46.171 --> 00:48.923
you must learn to first kill
a little bit of yourself.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.677
Well, I guess it's sort
of good for Joseph to, uh...

00:52.761 --> 00:54.387
learn the family trade.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.348
It's a father-to-son heritage thing.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.017
As a father yourself, Hank,

00:59.100 --> 01:02.479
who has sired an heir
on your woman, you understand.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.236
You're fine. Right, Bill?

01:10.320 --> 01:14.574
I wish I had a son...
to pass things down to.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.910
Boomhauer, can you get him a...

01:18.620 --> 01:20.246
Dang it.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.916
All right, Bill, let's hear again

01:23.041 --> 01:27.587
how you're lonely and
childless and whatnot.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.506
Okay.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.967
So I think that's the saddest thing
about being alone.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.803
Well, no, no. Actually...

01:34.886 --> 01:37.222
Bill, stop it. You've got family.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.848
You have your cousin Gilbert

01:38.932 --> 01:41.226
in the swamp in Louisiana.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.186
And that old fella in the iron lung,

01:43.269 --> 01:45.396
maybe he's still kicking. That's a start.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.357
But we... And I bet there's more.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.609
I hear you can hire a genealogist

01:49.692 --> 01:51.986
that will find family members for you.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.614
A genealogist can find them? Huh.

01:56.825 --> 01:57.826
<i>Lots of Americans</i>

01:57.909 --> 01:59.494
have ancestors who were royalty,

01:59.577 --> 02:02.705
African princesses, Gaelic chieftains.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.916
Tracing them just takes time and money

02:04.999 --> 02:06.876
and a flexible definition of "royalty."

02:06.960 --> 02:08.294
I have all three!

02:08.378 --> 02:11.965
But I want to find my living
relatives for a family reunion.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.260
Find living people? All right!

02:15.343 --> 02:18.263
Now, I assume you've already
tried calling Information.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.099
It's time to take it to the next level.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.853
I'm going on a site called Google.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.146
Oh!

02:29.232 --> 02:33.945
And, if the fork comes out clean,
your cake is done.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.447
I did it!

02:36.531 --> 02:39.033
I can bake! Yeah!

02:39.117 --> 02:40.368
Bobby?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.662
Are those... oven mitts?

02:42.745 --> 02:44.664
Hank, this is not what it looks like.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.500
Dad, I'm just going to
come right out and say it.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.335
I've baked a cake.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.379
What? No.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.257
I think cooking is something
I could be good at.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.925
It's just like shop,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.094
but, when you're done,
you get to lick your tools.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.805
Shop is nothing like baking!

03:00.889 --> 03:03.683
You can't live inside a cake you've built.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.478
You... you can't cut your
finger off with a pastry bag.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.657
My family! 85 names.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.576
Well, a lot of them won't be blood kin,

03:21.659 --> 03:24.078
but I say, "It's a family reunion!

03:24.162 --> 03:26.539
Invite 'em all, and let God sort 'em out!"

03:26.623 --> 03:28.875
85 people?

03:28.958 --> 03:32.045
That cable spool you call a
dinner table only seats six.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.630
You sure you can handle this, Bill?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.423
I don't know, actually.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.218
I'm making my family's
traditional Cajun barbecue,

03:38.301 --> 03:39.886
so I got so much to do.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.555
Clean my house, order 15 whole pigs,

03:42.639 --> 03:44.307
and get those little... What do you call

03:44.390 --> 03:46.351
those little paper napkins
they decorate with?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.269
I've never celebrated
anything before, Hank!

03:48.353 --> 03:50.688
You have to help me!

03:50.772 --> 03:53.566
Don't worry, Bill. We're on it.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.026
Oh, thank God.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.071
Okay, now, remember, everyone,

03:58.154 --> 04:00.031
we will be cleaning Bill's house,

04:00.114 --> 04:02.909
so we got a lot of work and not much time.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.910
Dale, you handle

04:03.993 --> 04:05.620
the silverfish.

04:05.703 --> 04:08.373
Boomhauer, you clean out the garage.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.291
Peggy and Nancy, you tackle the bathroom.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.169
Hank? I'm going to need a pit hand

04:13.253 --> 04:14.712
to help with the barbecue.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.506
We can be pit hands! Pit hands!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.299
No. I thought Bobby could do it.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.885
But I thought you didn't want me to cook.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.845
It's not cooking, Bobby.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.555
It's barbecue.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.894
Mr. Dauterive, I'm so ready for this!

04:29.978 --> 04:33.022
I want to make sauces
and stupid mad vinaigrettes!

04:33.106 --> 04:34.440
Well, that's great, Bobby,

04:34.524 --> 04:36.359
but first, we have to build a barbecue pit

04:36.442 --> 04:37.694
and stock the fuel.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.863
Oh.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.115
So what do you want to do?

04:42.198 --> 04:43.783
Stack bricks or haul wood?

04:47.745 --> 04:50.081
I'll haul the wood.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.759
Bill, we found that picture
you've been searching for.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
It's our last family photo. Oh!

05:06.431 --> 05:07.849
That's Uncle Honore

05:07.932 --> 05:10.310
after the swamp fever
claimed his eyesight.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.894
That's me.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.855
And there's my cousin Gilbert.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.232
What a time we had!

05:16.316 --> 05:18.526
I would climb trees and swim,

05:18.609 --> 05:21.821
and Gilbert made ball gowns
out of old mosquito netting.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.920
It's all so beautiful.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.339
I can't thank you enough.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
Well, it was close, but we pulled it off.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.969
Bill, that is a well-made barbecue pit.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.347
It's an old family design.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.682
Wow, son. You helped Bill build that?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.393
How did you keep your bricks so level?

05:52.477 --> 05:56.230
Did you go with the Hansen pattern
or the McCauley?

05:56.314 --> 06:00.943
Well, you see, bricks
have very brick-like, um...

06:01.027 --> 06:03.780
So when you have two bricks,

06:03.863 --> 06:05.490
there's some stuff involved...

06:05.573 --> 06:07.575
Sorry, Hank. It's a family secret.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.243
I swore Bobby to secrecy.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.328
Right, Bobby?

06:11.412 --> 06:13.706
Uh... yeah. I swore.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.749
All right, then.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.001
Well, I thank you all.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.045
You've been like a family to me.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.464
But now my real
family is coming, so goodbye.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.358
Wait! Wait! Coming! Please wait! Don't go!

06:42.110 --> 06:46.406
Guillaume... you are a vision.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.866
And that necktie would be elegance itself

06:48.950 --> 06:51.077
if it were knotted properly.

06:51.160 --> 06:55.123
Ah! Gilbert! <i>Bienvenu!</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:57.917
Uh... anyone else?
Isn't there anyone else?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.335
Only you?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.338
Only me? Whom were you expecting?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.715
I had... I had a... a list.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.218
Alas, we two are the utter end

07:07.301 --> 07:09.554
of the Dauterive blood.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.097
The family tree can be safely

07:11.180 --> 07:14.392
cut down, and used to build our coffins.

07:16.102 --> 07:16.936
May I come in?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.197
There's no one but us?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.325
But what about Aunt Esme
and cousin Violetta?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.952
Aunt Esme died of fever,

07:33.035 --> 07:35.413
Violetta died suddenly in her sleep.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.749
The swamp takes what it calls its own.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.753
Let me tell you of our ill-fated kin.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.048
Consumption, drink, impostor,

07:46.132 --> 07:48.843
madhouse, public madhouse,

07:48.926 --> 07:51.429
barren, barren, barren.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.265
Well, pretty much this whole left side,

07:54.348 --> 07:56.517
leaving only us.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.186
My whole life is a waste.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.688
I'll never pass down anything to anyone.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.565
You personally, no,

08:02.648 --> 08:05.568
but the Dauterive name <i>will</i> live on.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.278
<i>"Dauterive's Monthly.</i>

08:07.361 --> 08:09.530
A Southern review of arts and letters."

08:09.614 --> 08:10.865
A small

08:10.948 --> 08:13.493
but proud periodical I have founded

08:13.576 --> 08:16.537
that will preserve our name
for generations to come.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.539
"Printed on acid-free paper."

08:18.623 --> 08:19.916
Naturally.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.335
Wow. How are you paying for this?

08:22.418 --> 08:25.671
Our land has been sold
to be turned into either

08:25.755 --> 08:28.299
a water park or a catfish farm.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.969
Seems to depend on whether
the Euro remains strong.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.270
Hi, everyone! I brought you some barbecue

08:41.395 --> 08:42.730
so it doesn't go to waste.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.857
Oh, uh, thanks.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
Are you sure you don't want
this for yourself?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.195
I mean, you usually like to eat a lot

08:49.278 --> 08:52.281
when your plans are in ruins and whatnot.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.033
No, everything's great.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.953
Gilbert and I are starting
a poetry magazine.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.039
We're not going to be parents,
we're going to be publishers.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.666
Think about it.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.335
A kid lasts only about,
what, 80 years tops?

09:04.418 --> 09:06.462
But literature goes on forever.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.673
See ya! Enjoy!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.718
Well, it smells decent.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.762
"Poetry magazine"?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.684
I cannot freakin' believe this stuff!

09:19.767 --> 09:21.435
Tell me we are not out of ribs!

09:21.519 --> 09:22.895
No, thank God.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.022
Mm, wow.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.315
What smells so good?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
It's your barbecue, son.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.361
Oh, yeah.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.905
And it is the best got-dang thing

09:32.989 --> 09:34.198
I've ever tasted.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.617
Come sit at the head of the table.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.827
You earned it.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.664
Dad, Mom,

09:41.747 --> 09:44.250
I didn't help Mr. Dauterive.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.461
I ran off because the work was too hard.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.464
Well, that's just more for us then.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.384
Hey, you didn't work
on the barbecue either!

09:53.467 --> 09:55.886
But I also didn't lie about it.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.264
I said I was sorry.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.433
Shouldn't you reward me
for telling the truth?

10:00.516 --> 10:01.726
No.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.605
Yep.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.148
Mm, yep.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.357
I do declare.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.026
Mm-hmm.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.403
Oh, God!

10:12.486 --> 10:14.572
So, Bill, what's you're, uh,

10:14.655 --> 10:17.074
secret with this pork shoulder?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.743
-Well...
-Secret?

10:18.826 --> 10:23.414
Yes, the recipe was honed
by generations of planters,

10:23.497 --> 10:26.125
country lawyers, gentlemen of fortune...

10:26.208 --> 10:29.003
and their cooks and manservants
and so forth.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.880
Well, Gillaume,

10:30.963 --> 10:33.049
as much as I shall miss the dazzle

10:33.132 --> 10:34.717
of the local repartee,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.510
I fear I must take my leave

10:36.594 --> 10:38.304
and be off to Austin.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.639
Leave?

10:39.722 --> 10:42.058
But we were having so much fun.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.603
There's a young poet there
whom I hope to... publish.

10:45.686 --> 10:46.687
But...

10:48.981 --> 10:50.024
my family!

10:50.107 --> 10:51.692
He just got here,

10:51.776 --> 10:54.278
and now what if he gets hit
by a bus or something?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.989
Then I'll have no relatives and no legacy.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.575
That's a lot of "what ifs," Bill.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.535
In the meantime, see what you did?

11:01.619 --> 11:02.620
You made some dang fine

11:02.703 --> 11:03.579
barbecue.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.957
You, uh, think I could
have some more leftovers

11:07.041 --> 11:08.626
to bring with me to work?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.169
Mine! Mine! Mine!

11:11.462 --> 11:13.339
<i>Mm, hot damn,</i>

11:13.422 --> 11:14.882
that is a flavorful rib!

11:14.965 --> 11:18.052
It's like them bones
never even existed, honey.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.137
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it, sir.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.681
I tell you something, ol' top.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.474
If I knew this bad boy's secret,

11:23.557 --> 11:25.685
I could make me a second fortune.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.354
Might come in handy
if my bastard son Ray Roy

11:28.437 --> 11:30.648
ever gets hold of a competent lawyer.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.194
Buck liked my barbecue?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.947
Yep, and he wants
to round up big investors

11:38.030 --> 11:39.699
to take your recipe public,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.576
so you'll have to make them
a tasting batch.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.454
Wow, Gilbert will preserve
our name with his magazine,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.290
and now I'll get to pass it down, too.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.875
People will eat my food and say,

11:49.959 --> 11:53.087
"Boy, those Dauterive's were something

11:53.170 --> 11:55.172
It's a shame they're extinct."

11:55.256 --> 11:56.590
I'll get right on it.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.363
I'm sorry I ditched last time.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.781
I want to help.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.366
Are you sure, Bobby?

12:22.450 --> 12:24.493
I don't cut corners with this recipe.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.580
I'll carry bricks,
hammer nails, pour cement,

12:27.663 --> 12:30.166
whatever it takes to be a real cook.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.840
Mr. Dauterive, there's a blender
right there

12:37.923 --> 12:39.341
with a "chop" setting.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.719
I bet it could get through these onions
in no time.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.599
Well, that's fine
if I'm grinding up old sandwiches

12:46.682 --> 12:48.225
for breakfast hash,

12:48.309 --> 12:50.728
but as my Uncle Honore always said,

12:50.811 --> 12:53.773
"Shortcuts taste like <i>un chien mart!</i>"

12:53.856 --> 12:55.274
Eh?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.031
Now we can add the marinade.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.578
Huh, needs more garlic.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.836
By family tradition,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.296
we only light the fire

13:17.379 --> 13:19.632
with a page of good news from the paper.

13:19.715 --> 13:23.385
"Baboon arrives safely at Space Station."

13:23.469 --> 13:25.763
Space monkeys are always good news.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.019
You're on your way to being a real cook.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.187
You do the honors, Bobby.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.077
Well, Mr. Strickland should be here soon.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.787
How'd my boy do, Bill?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.330
I couldn't have done it without him.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.582
He tended the pit for 20 straight hours

13:53.666 --> 13:54.959
and only passed out once.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.377
Well, all right.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.879
There's my Cajunator.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.258
Okay, boy, time to meet the team
and jump through a few hoops.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.183
There's quite a fete going on
at my cousin's.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.186
Oh, lawd, I still have my Austin face on.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.815
So, Ted, you ready to invest
in hillbilly sauce genius?

14:17.898 --> 14:18.899
Quiet, Kahn.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.317
I'm running numbers in my head.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.615
Okay, everybody, I'd like
to introduce you all now

14:26.699 --> 14:28.534
to the man behind this food,

14:28.617 --> 14:29.952
Mr. Bill...

14:30.035 --> 14:31.787
Guillaume!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.581
What is all this?

14:33.664 --> 14:35.332
Now hold on, Gilbert, we...

14:35.416 --> 14:38.127
Sir, you are no kin to me,
so I will have your silence.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.045
Guillaume, explain.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.840
People like our food so much,
I wanted to pass it on,

14:42.923 --> 14:44.216
just like the magazine.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.593
And these rich fellas,

14:45.676 --> 14:47.595
they want to make a line
of barbecue sauces

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
made from the Dauterive recipe.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.598
Are you mad?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.183
We are a family of proud landowners.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.978
Of state senators and literary men.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.855
And you want to sell our family tradition?

14:57.938 --> 14:58.939
For... money?

14:59.023 --> 15:00.691
Well... kinda.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.404
Shut down this... whorehouse!

15:16.916 --> 15:18.459
Uh... okay.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.796
I'm sorry, everyone,
but the kitchen is closed.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.382
Bill, no.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.508
What the heck are you...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.385
Hank, he's my only relative.
He's all I have.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.803
I can't go against him.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.233
Bye, everyone.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.110
See you in...

15:45.194 --> 15:46.570
See you later.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.122
How could you do it?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.207
Tell me that.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.333
Tell me how, how, how?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.253
Bill does not deserve to be
left alone with that...

16:03.337 --> 16:04.964
Gilbert.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.090
I'm going over.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.973
I have sacrificed our land
to preserve our dignity.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.475
What would you have done

16:16.558 --> 16:18.352
with your streetwalker's gold, eh?

16:18.435 --> 16:20.479
Bought more of these?

16:20.562 --> 16:23.524
"Double-Stuffed Chocolate
Sandwich Cookies"?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.776
<i>J'accusel!</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:30.406
Say, how you doing there, Gilbert?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.574
Bill, I brought you some coffee.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.954
Sir, leave us. Let the Dauterives
nurse their wounded pride in darkness.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.374
Yeah, I keep hearing about
the Dauterive pride.

16:40.457 --> 16:44.211
But right now, all I see are a
crying drunk and an angry sissy.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.046
If you've got any real pride,

16:46.130 --> 16:47.965
stop kicking a man when he's down.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.425
You want to talk more about this,

16:49.508 --> 16:51.093
you and I will do it outside.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.390
Guillaume, I am returning to New Orleans.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.568
Bill, why don't you forget this joker,

17:07.651 --> 17:11.030
and let Mr. Strickland and his business
partners invest in you?

17:11.113 --> 17:14.158
When you were busy cooking,
you were so happy and proud.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.786
I was, wasn't I?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.373
Okay.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.625
I'll do it.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.086
But I have to get Gilbert to agree.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.880
Aw, Bill...

17:27.963 --> 17:30.674
I didn't make the recipe, my family did.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.676
It's not mine alone to sell.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.803
Hank, if I don't act honorably,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.014
there's no point in preserving my name.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.475
It's just a word that women
have trouble remembering.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.817
Ha-ba-hey.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.861
Are you speaking to me?

17:50.944 --> 17:53.072
Want to buy a...?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.036
I'm sorry.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.871
Not at all.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.790
I think it was Lucretius who said

18:02.873 --> 18:05.209
"Nothing human disgusts me."

18:05.292 --> 18:06.335
Yeah.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.754
Lord.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.506
Gilbert,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.466
Mr. Strickland has a proposal.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.176
Yeah. How do.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.888
Now, I understand you
a literary man from 'Ouisiana.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.974
Now, you and me, we gotta
do the Quarter some time.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.894
Boy, I could show you some things, huh?

18:23.977 --> 18:27.231
My word.

18:27.314 --> 18:31.068
Anyone else want to give this a whirl?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.195
If you let me sell the recipe,

18:33.278 --> 18:34.822
I'll give you my share of the profits

18:34.905 --> 18:36.198
to help pay for the magazine.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.574
Can't be done.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.618
A gentleman never reverses his decision.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.829
Do look me up, though,

18:41.912 --> 18:43.622
when you pass through New Orleans.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.751
I could show <i>you</i> things as well.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.587
Yeah...

18:50.671 --> 18:52.089
Yeah, let's, let's go, ol' top.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.632
There ain't nothing more here to try.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.428
Oh, please, please, let me do this.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.514
I don't want to die with
nothing to show for my life

19:00.597 --> 19:01.849
and nothing to pass on.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.476
Just say yes, and I'll
never bother you again.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.353
My dear cousin...

19:06.436 --> 19:09.148
my only cousin...

19:09.231 --> 19:11.775
my answer is still no.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.277
Above all,

19:13.360 --> 19:15.737
the Dauterives must go down to darkness

19:15.821 --> 19:17.990
with their honor intact.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.869
Trust me, one day
when you're on your deathbed

19:21.952 --> 19:24.121
all alone, you'll thank me.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.958
And so, <i>adieu.</i>

19:28.041 --> 19:29.543
Now, I have matters to discuss

19:29.626 --> 19:31.211
with my new acquaintance.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.546
You were saying...?

19:32.629 --> 19:35.090
I gotta get me a...

19:41.263 --> 19:43.932
I'm not gonna open the door just yet.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.976
Maybe I'll just stand here a while.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.936
It'll give me something
to look forward to.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.981
Oh, what's the point?

19:59.239 --> 20:00.866
Bobby?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.951
Mr. Dauterive, I had a great idea

20:03.035 --> 20:04.953
on how to improve the glaze.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.207
I mixed cayenne pepper
with the brown sugar.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.625
What do you think?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.670
Well, Bobby.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.173
Ooh, it has an under-taste.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.925
Bobby, that's very good.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.219
Now when you hit the stores
with all your sauces,

20:20.302 --> 20:23.430
maybe you can call this your
"Sugar and Spicy" version.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.975
Bobby, I don't know how to say this,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.561
but I can't sell the recipe.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.563
I can't even sell the sauce.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.857
There's no point in thinking
about this anymore.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.275
Oh.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.908
But...

20:42.991 --> 20:44.034
I guess there's no reason

20:44.117 --> 20:46.119
we can't make it and give it away

20:46.203 --> 20:48.747
at, say, a party for your Mom's birthday.

20:48.830 --> 20:49.790
It's the 17th, right?

20:49.873 --> 20:51.708
If you say so.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.543
And you know, when you grow up,

20:53.627 --> 20:55.212
there's no reason you can't

20:55.295 --> 20:56.755
make it and give it away, too.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.215
That'd be great.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.177
But... I'm not a Dauterive.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.597
Bobby, trust me.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.015
I'd be honored.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.646
Ha-ba-hey.
