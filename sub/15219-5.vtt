<i>There are always a few surprises</i>

00:14.703 --> 00:16.694
<i>Some of them are small.</i>

00:18.474 --> 00:21.068
<i>And some of them are not so small.</i>

00:23.212 --> 00:28.548
<i>Leaping into the life of a working woman</i>
<i>taught me that surprises and problems</i>
<i>come in all shapes and sizes.</i>

00:28.617 --> 00:31.017
<i>Some were easy to handle.</i>

00:34.423 --> 00:36.414
<i>Some were difficult.</i>

00:37.426 --> 00:39.394
<i>And some were a pleasure.</i>

<i>I can always count on it...</i>

I was just wondering what year...
[Laughing]

05:48.470 --> 05:52.531
what time it was,
and I thought I'd ask the news vendor.

05:54.543 --> 05:56.602
That's incredible. How did you know
we were at a newsstand?

05:56.678 --> 06:00.876

It's 11:30.
Oh.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.954
I guess I'm still kind of a little
keyed up from the concert.

06:20.535 --> 06:25.472
- <i>Mind if I ask you a question?</i>
- As long as it's not about anything
personal or professional.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.273
[Chuckles]
What made you
decide to play "Chopsticks"?

06:30.345 --> 06:32.438
Um, it's the only thing
that came to mind.

06:32.514 --> 06:34.982
[Both Chuckle]

06:35.050 --> 06:37.541
Why are we stopping?

06:37.619 --> 06:40.679
Because I told Mama
I'd be home by midnight.

06:40.756 --> 06:43.190
Your mother?
I know. I know.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.192
She still thinks I'm about 14.

06:45.260 --> 06:49.424
Well...
But let's not get started
about her again.

06:49.498 --> 06:52.399
You should at least wait until you
meet her before you make up your mind.

06:52.467 --> 06:55.994
I mean, I'm sure the two of you
will get along just great.

06:56.071 --> 06:58.232
You know, I've told her
all about you,

06:58.306 --> 07:01.469
and she's just so anxious to make
a good impression, you know.

07:01.543 --> 07:04.979
She just wants to wait until
everything is just right before...

07:05.047 --> 07:08.141
Michelle, it's okay.

07:08.216 --> 07:10.207
It'll wait.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.111
Sorry.

07:16.158 --> 07:20.492
Look, do you want me to pick up
your other tux at the cleaners tomorrow?

07:20.562 --> 07:22.996
Uh, if... You know,
if it won't be a problem.

07:23.065 --> 07:28.662

[Chuckles]

09:14.309 --> 09:19.872
- It's probably just a phase.
- It's bad enough we've got this jerk
stretchin' necks in Central Park.

09:19.948 --> 09:23.509
But now they got us pullin' double
shifts protecting these damn Brits,

09:23.585 --> 09:27.043
so they can stay in one piece
long enough to play <i>Ed Sullivan.</i>

09:27.122 --> 09:32.685

[Imitating Ed Sullivan]
Topo Gigio.

11:12.961 --> 11:15.953
No. I'm sorry.
I guess I lost track.

11:16.031 --> 11:18.727
How thoughtful.
I'm sitting here wondering...

11:18.800 --> 11:22.167
if my only daughter is lying in a gutter
somewhere, and you're sorry.

11:24.339 --> 11:28.867
I just went out for ice cream
with a couple of the girls
after we finished studying.

11:28.943 --> 11:32.242
- Which girls?
- Marcia and Aggie.

11:32.314 --> 11:34.748
You could have called me.

11:34.816 --> 11:38.809
I would have, but I didn't know
what time it was and...

11:38.887 --> 11:41.378
I don't know.
I guess we just got to talking,

11:41.456 --> 11:45.085
and before we knew it,
it was past midnight.
[Chuckles]

11:45.160 --> 11:47.094
Well, that's a conversation
I would like to have heard...

11:47.162 --> 11:51.258
since I know Marcia and Aggie spent
the entire night studying in the library...

11:52.834 --> 11:54.825
without you.

11:57.772 --> 11:59.740
You checked up on me?

12:02.844 --> 12:04.835
You forgot something.

12:10.418 --> 12:12.409
I guess it was too heavy, huh?

12:15.023 --> 12:17.116
So, what do we do now?
Play 20 questions?

12:17.192 --> 12:20.684
I went to a concert.

12:20.762 --> 12:22.787
It was a recital at Carnegie,

12:22.864 --> 12:25.799
and I got offered a ticket
at the last minute and I went.

12:25.867 --> 12:28.802
That's wonderful.
[Chuckles]

12:28.870 --> 12:30.963
I kill myself putting you
through nursing school,

12:31.039 --> 12:33.633
and you go gallivanting through
the city with God knows who.

12:34.609 --> 12:38.875
I wasn't with anyone.
It was just a concert.

12:38.947 --> 12:42.348
And when you flunk your finals, it will
be more than just a concert, won't it?

12:45.186 --> 12:47.120
And when your husband leaves you
with a hungry two-year-old...

12:47.188 --> 12:50.988
and you don't have any way
to earn a living, it will be
more than just a concert, won't it?

12:51.993 --> 12:54.120
And when you wake up
20 years later...

12:54.195 --> 12:56.220
and you realize that you're no longer
young and good-looking,

12:56.297 --> 12:59.130
but you're tired and you're worn out
from tryin' to support that baby,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.260

<i>just a concert, won't it?</i>

13:04.472 --> 13:06.463

and sweep you off your feet.

13:19.654 --> 13:22.851
You have got to learn
to fend for yourself once I'm gone.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.216
Yes, Mama.

13:27.896 --> 13:30.592
Nursing is a worthwhile profession.

13:30.665 --> 13:34.601
You earn a steady dollar, and there
will always be someone who needs help.

13:35.603 --> 13:39.403
And remember:
A fool's dreams may be dreams,

13:39.474 --> 13:42.272
but they also belong to a fool.
But they also belong to a fool.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.338

13:50.318 --> 13:53.185
Good night, dear.
Good night, Mama.

<i>She had an act in Tijuana.</i>

Her name was Evita Evilitita.

[Whines]
<i>She used to lie on her back on the bench...</i>

14:24.586 --> 14:26.850
and play oldies with her toesies.

14:26.921 --> 14:31.187

on the bench and bend over
and play modern music with her...

<i>and thank you.</i>

<i>keeps his music around here?</i>

How does Andrew
learn how to play all this?

14:58.019 --> 15:02.319
- He plays by ear.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

15:02.390 --> 15:05.086
Is there any chance I might leap outta
here before the concert tomorrow night?

15:05.159 --> 15:09.789

We are in New York City.
[Beeping]

15:09.864 --> 15:12.162

February 6, 1964.

15:12.233 --> 15:16.397
Right. Oh, that's three days before
the Beatles play the <i>Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

15:16.471 --> 15:20.168
Al, why am I here?
Sam, the women fainted...

15:20.241 --> 15:22.641
and screamed
when they saw them on TV.

15:22.710 --> 15:26.407
That's how come the next day,
I went out and bought a long-haired wig.

15:26.481 --> 15:30.008
Got ya. All right. Let's see.

15:30.084 --> 15:34.180
According to Ziggy,
Andrew's concert was a huge success.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.587
It won't be now.
<i>And</i>... <i>Oh, boy.</i>

15:36.658 --> 15:42.597

15:52.941 --> 15:56.399
- <i>[Sam] Is Ziggy sure about this?</i>
- As sure as he ever is about anything.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.945
Wait a second, Al.

15:59.013 --> 16:03.450
- We're forgetting something.
Andrew is blind, but I'm not.
- [Whining]

16:03.518 --> 16:08.114
I can prevent anything
from happening to Michelle
in the park after... the concert.

16:08.189 --> 16:10.180
Al, what am I gonna do?
I can't play a concert.

16:10.258 --> 16:11.987
- Sure you can.
- I can?

16:12.060 --> 16:14.961
- I'll help you.
- You're a concert pianist?

16:15.029 --> 16:17.793
I couldn't play "Chopsticks"
in Chinatown.

16:17.865 --> 16:21.995

- Trust me.

16:22.070 --> 16:27.030

is fall into bed.

looking forward to meeting you.

21:17.198 --> 21:21.225
She must really be proud of you,

about the others.

What happened?
Al...

36:11.892 --> 36:15.328
A flashbulb exploded in my face.
My eyes are on fire.

<i>[Al] We gotta get you</i>
<i>to a hospital real fast.</i>

36:17.397 --> 36:19.865
No. There's no time for that.
Michelle's probably in the park already.

36:19.933 --> 36:22.401
God, my eyes are hurt!
Oh, Sam.

36:23.436 --> 36:27.031
- <i>Water, Al.</i>
- There's a fountain across the street, Sam.

36:27.107 --> 36:29.701
A fountain. Go!

<i>That's it, Sam. Straight ahead.</i>
<i>Come on. You're doin'fine.</i>

37:39.145 --> 37:41.340
No, we're not.
We're wastin' too much time.

37:41.414 --> 37:44.110
What do you mean, wastin' time?
Most people would be
at the hospital right now...

37:44.184 --> 37:46.482
having their eyes looked at
before they lost them!

37:46.553 --> 37:49.989
While Michelle loses her life?
I'll risk my eyes. Come on. Let's go.

What? What's the matter?

39:10.303 --> 39:13.329
There's a fork in the road now.
We gotta make a choice.

39:14.774 --> 39:16.708
Which way, Chopin?
Which way to Michelle?

39:16.776 --> 39:18.243
<i>[Chopin Barks]</i>

Al, wait. He's on to something.

- It's gettin' better, Al.

44:15.942 --> 44:18.604
choking the life out of her
just as surely as Pete was.

44:18.678 --> 44:20.669
And you won't, huh?

44:25.551 --> 44:29.009
I hope not.

leaving you, Mama.
